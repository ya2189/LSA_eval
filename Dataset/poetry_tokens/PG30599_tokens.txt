mist
in
the
valley
i
mist
in
the
valley
weeping
mist
beset
my
homeward
way
no
gleam
of
rose
or
amethyst
hallowed
the
parting
day
a
shroud
a
shroud
of
awful
grey
wrapped
every
woodland
brow
and
drooped
in
crumbling
disarray
around
each
wintry
bough
ii
and
closer
round
me
now
it
clung
until
i
scarce
could
see
the
stealthy
pathway
overhung
by
silent
tree
and
tree
which
floated
in
that
mystery
as
poised
in
waveless
deeps
branching
in
worlds
below
the
sea
the
grey
sleeps
iii
mist
in
the
valley
mist
no
less
within
my
groping
mind
the
stile
swam
out
a
wilderness
rolled
round
it
grey
and
blind
a
yard
in
front
a
yard
behind
so
strait
my
world
was
grown
i
stooped
to
win
once
more
some
kind
glimmer
of
twig
or
stone
iv
i
crossed
and
lost
the
friendly
stile
and
listened
never
a
sound
came
to
me
mile
on
mile
on
mile
it
seemed
the
world
around
beneath
some
infinite
sea
lay
drowned
with
all
that
drew
breath
whilst
i
alone
had
strangely
found
a
moment
life
in
death
v
a
universe
of
lifeless
grey
oppressed
me
overhead
below
a
yard
of
clinging
clay
with
rotting
foliage
red
glimmered
the
stillness
of
the
dead
hark
was
it
broken
now
by
the
slow
drip
of
tears
that
bled
from
hidden
heart
or
bough
vi
mist
in
the
valley
mist
no
less
that
muffled
every
cry
across
the
soul
grey
wilderness
where
faith
lay
down
to
die
buried
beyond
all
hope
was
i
hope
had
no
meaning
there
a
yard
above
my
head
the
sky
could
only
mock
at
prayer
vii
as
i
groped
along
the
gloom
suddenly
shook
at
my
feet
o
strangely
as
from
a
rending
tomb
in
resurrection
sweet
swift
wings
tumultuously
beat
away
i
paused
to
hark
o
birds
of
thought
too
fair
too
fleet
to
follow
across
the
dark
viii
yet
like
a
madman
dream
there
came
one
fair
swift
flash
to
me
of
distances
of
streets
with
joy
and
agony
and
further
yet
a
sea
foaming
across
its
bars
and
further
yet
the
infinity
of
wheeling
suns
and
stars
ix
and
further
yet
o
mist
of
suns
i
grope
amidst
your
light
o
further
yet
what
vast
response
from
what
transcendent
height
wild
wings
that
burst
thro
death
dim
night
i
can
but
pause
and
hark
for
o
ye
are
too
swift
too
white
to
follow
across
the
dark
x
mist
in
the
valley
yet
i
saw
and
in
my
soul
i
knew
the
gleaming
city
whence
i
draw
the
strength
that
then
i
drew
my
misty
pathway
to
pursue
with
steady
pulse
and
breath
through
these
dim
of
dew
and
darkness
life
and
death
a
song
of
the
plough
i
idle
comfortless
bare
the
broad
bleak
acres
lie
the
ploughman
guides
the
sharp
ploughshare
steadily
nigh
the
big
lift
and
climb
from
the
marge
of
the
sea
and
the
clouds
of
their
breath
on
the
clear
wind
drift
over
the
fallow
lea
streaming
up
with
the
yoke
brown
as
the
loam
thro
a
smother
of
sweat
and
smoke
the
two
great
horses
come
up
thro
the
raw
cold
morn
they
trample
and
drag
and
swing
and
my
dreams
are
waving
with
ungrown
corn
in
a
spring
it
is
my
soul
lies
bare
between
the
hills
and
the
sea
come
ploughman
life
with
thy
sharp
ploughshare
and
plough
the
field
for
me
ii
over
the
darkening
plain
as
the
stars
regain
the
sky
steals
the
chime
of
an
unseen
rein
steadily
nigh
lost
in
the
deepening
red
the
sea
has
forgotten
the
shore
the
great
dark
steeds
with
their
muffled
tread
draw
near
once
more
to
the
furrow
end
they
sweep
like
a
sombre
wave
of
the
sea
lifting
its
crest
to
challenge
the
deep
hush
of
eternity
still
for
a
moment
they
stand
massed
on
the
sun
red
death
a
surge
of
bronze
too
great
too
grand
to
endure
for
more
than
a
breath
only
the
billow
and
stream
of
muscle
and
flank
and
mane
like
darkling
gleam
gripped
in
a
titan
rein
once
more
from
the
furrow
end
they
wheel
to
the
fallow
lea
and
down
the
muffled
slope
descend
to
the
sleeping
sea
and
the
fibrous
knots
of
clay
and
the
clots
of
earth
cleave
and
the
sunset
cloaks
the
grey
waste
and
the
stony
dearth
o
broad
and
dusky
and
sweet
the
sunset
covers
the
weald
but
my
dreams
are
waving
with
golden
wheat
in
a
still
strange
field
my
soul
my
soul
lies
bare
between
the
hills
and
the
sea
come
ploughman
death
with
thy
sharp
ploughshare
and
plough
the
field
for
me
the
banner
who
in
the
gorgeous
vanguard
of
the
years
with
wingèd
helmet
glistens
let
him
hold
ere
he
pluck
down
this
banner
crying
it
bears
an
old
device
for
though
it
seem
the
old
it
is
the
new
no
rent
shroud
of
the
past
but
its
transfigured
spirit
that
still
shines
triumphantly
before
the
foremost
lines
even
from
the
first
prophesying
the
last
and
whoso
dreams
to
pluck
it
down
shall
stand
bewildered
while
the
great
host
thunders
by
and
he
shall
show
the
rent
shroud
in
his
hand
and
lo
i
lead
the
van
he
still
shall
cry
while
leagues
away
the
shines
rushing
in
triumph
before
the
foremost
lines
rank
and
file
i
who
is
it
marching
marching
past
in
the
night
ah
hark
draw
your
curtains
aside
and
see
endless
ranks
of
the
stars
endless
ranks
of
an
army
marching
marching
out
of
the
measureless
dark
marching
away
to
eternity
ii
see
the
gleam
of
the
white
sad
faces
moving
steadily
row
on
row
marching
away
to
their
hopeless
wars
where
are
they
marching
terrible
beautiful
human
faces
common
as
dirt
but
softer
than
snow
coarser
than
clay
but
calm
as
the
stars
iii
is
it
the
last
rank
readily
steadily
swinging
away
to
the
unknown
doom
ere
you
can
think
it
the
beat
louder
and
here
they
come
marching
marching
great
new
level
locked
ranks
of
them
readily
steadily
swinging
out
of
the
gloom
marching
endlessly
down
the
street
iv
unregarded
imperial
regiments

from
the
roaring
intricate
places
deep
in

maw
of
the
world

regiments

terrible
faces

that
might
have
been

hints
and
facets
of
one

eternal
faces
of
grief
compassion
and
pain
faces
of
hunger
faces
of
stone

love

of
labour

changing
facets

eternal
streaming
up
thro
the
wind
and
the
rain
all
together
and
each
alone

passion

night

passion

taken
their
master
away

one
law

fame
that
will
live
half
as
long

pellet
of

nameless

empty

voicelessly

secretly

such
deathless

told

as

as

you
could
almost

up

the
old

woke
and
moaned
in

and
the

old

went
by
singing
the
same
old
song
as
ages
and
ages
ago
while
he
froze
my
blood
in
that
night
with
the
things
that
he
seemed
to
know
a
bare
foot
pattered
on
deck
ropes
creaked
then
all
grew
still
and
he
pointed
his
finger
straight
in
my
face
and
growled
as
a
will
do
ee
know
who
nelson
was
that
pore
little
shrivelled
form
with
the
patch
on
his
eye
and
the

and
a
soul
like
a
north
sea
storm
ask
of
the

men
they
know
and
they
tell
you
true
he
was
the
pore
little
chap
that
hardy
thought
he
knew
he
was
the
man
you
think
his
patch
was
a
dern
disguise
for
he
knew
that
they
find
him
out
see
if
they
looked
him
in
both
his
eyes
he
was
twice
as
big
as
he
seemed
but
his
clothes
were
cunningly
made
he
both
of
his
hairy
arms
all
right
the
sleeve
was
a
trick
of
the
trade
you
heard
of
sperrits
no
doubt
well
there
more
in
the
matter
than
that
but
he
was
the
patch
and
he
was
the
sleeve
and
he
was
the
laced
was
just
a
ghost
you
may
laugh
but
the
devonshire
men
they
knew
that
he
come
when
england
called
and
they
know
that
he
come
again
i
tell
you
the
way
it
was
for
none
of
the
landsmen
know
and
to
tell
it
you
right
you
must
go
two
hundred
years

so
the

were
lapping

slapping
the

as
they
are

drake
lay
dying

the

you

you
to

there
in

they
boomed
a
broadside
over
his
grave
as
meanin
to

they
sailed
away
in

the

little

in

the

of
a

they
saw

memories
roll
to
an
ageless
sea
in
a
railway
carriage
three
long
isles
of
poised
in
an
ocean
of
gold
floated
away
in
the
west
as
the
long
train
southward
rolled
and
through
the
gleam
and
shade
of
the
panes
while
meadow
and
wood
went
by
across
the
streaming
earth
we
watched
the
steadfast
sky
dark
before
the
westward
window
heavy
and
bloated
rolled
the
face
of
a
drunken
woman
nodding
against
the
gold
dark
before
the
infinite
glory
with
bleared
and
leering
eyes
it
stupidly
lurched
and
nodded
against
the
tender
skies
had
ye
done
to
her
masters
of
men
that
her
head
be
bowed
down
thus
thus
for
your
golden
vespers
and
deepening
angelus
dark
besotted
malignant
vacant
slobbering
wrinkled
old
weary
and
wickedly
smiling
she
nodded
against
the
gold
pitiful
loathsome
maudlin
lonely
her
moist
inhuman
eyes
blinked
at
the
flies
on
the
window
and
could
not
see
the
skies
as
a
beast
that
turns
and
returns
to
a
mirror
and
will
not
see
its
face
her
eyes
rejected
the
sunset
her
soul
lay
dead
in
its
place
dead
in
the
furrows
and
folds
of
her
flesh
as
a
corpse
lies
lapped
in
the
shroud
silently
floated
beside
her
the
isles
of
had
ye
done
to
her
years
upon
years
that
her
head
should
be
bowed
down
thus
thus
for
your
golden
vespers
and
deepening
angelus
her
nails
were
blackened
and
split
with
labour
her
back
was
heavily
bowed
silently
floated
beside
her
the
isles
of
over
their
tapering
streaks
of
lilac
in
breathless
depths
afar
bright
as
the
tear
of
an
angel
glittered
a
lonely
star
while
the
hills
and
the
streams
of
the
world
went
past
us
and
the
long
train
roared
and
rolled
southward
and
dusk
was
falling
she
nodded
against
the
gold
an
down
the
dark
alley
a
ring
of
orange
light
glows
god
what
leprous
tatters
of
distress
droppings
of
misery
rags
of
thy
loneliness
quiver
and
heave
like
vermin
out
of
the
night
like
crippled
rats
creeping
out
of
the
gloom
o
life
for
one
of
thy
terrible
moments
there
lit
by
the
little
flickering
yellow
flare
faces
that
mock
at
life
and
death
and
doom
faces
that
long
long
since
have
known
the
worst
faces
of
women
that
have
seen
the
child
waste
in
their
arms
and
strangely
terribly
smiled
when
the
dark
nipple
of
death
has
eased
its
thirst
faces
of
men
that
once
though
long
ago
saw
the
faint
light
of
hope
though
far
away
hope
that
at
end
of
some
tremendous
day
they
yet
might
reach
some
life
where
tears
could
flow
faces
of
our
humanity
ravaged
white
wrenched
with
old
love
old
hate
older
despair
steal
out
of
vile
dens
to
stare
on
that
wild
monstrance
of
a
naphtha
light
they
crowd
before
the
stall
bright
altar
rail
grotesque
and
sacred
for
that
light
brief
span
and
all
the
shuddering
darkness
cries
all
hail
daughters
and
sons
of
man
see
see
once
more
though
all
their
souls
be
dead
they
hold
it
up
triumphantly
hold
it
up
they
feel
they
warm
their
hands
upon
the
cup
their
crapulous
hands
their
hands
break
bread
see
with
lean
faces
rapturously
for
a
brief
while
they
dream
and
munch
and
drink
then
one
by
one
once
more
silently
slink
back
back
into
the
gulfing
mist
they
go
one
by
one
out
of
the
ring
of
light
they
creep
like
crippled
rats
into
the
gloom
into
the
fogs
of
life
and
death
and
doom
into
the
night
the
immeasurable
night
red
of
the
dawn
i
the
dawn
peered
in
with
eyes
pressed
close
against
the
cracked
old
pane
the
garret
slept
the
slow
sad
rain
had
ceased
grey
fogs
obscured
the
skies
but
dawn
peered
in
with
haggard
eyes
ii
all
as
last
night
the
chair
the
bare
walls
and
the
tattered
bed
all
but
for
those
wild
flakes
of
red
and
dawn
perhaps
had
splashed
them
there
round
the
bare
walls
the
bed
the
chair
iii
was
here
last
night
when
winds
were
loud
a
ragged
she
came
out
of
the
tavern
glare
and
shame
with
some
few
pence
for
she
was
proud
came
home
to
sleep
when
winds
were
loud
iv
and
she
sleeps
well
for
she
was
tired
that
huddled
shape
beneath
the
sheet
with
knees
no
wind
or
sleet
can
wake
her
now
sleep
she
desired
and
she
sleeps
well
for
she
was
tired
v
and
there
was
one
that
followed
her
with
some
unhappy
curse
called
love
last
night
though
winds
beat
loud
above
she
shrank
hark
on
the
creaking
stair
what
stealthy
footstep
followed
her
vi
but
now
the
curse
it
seemed
had
gone
the
small
wherein
she
hid
old
childish
treasures
had
burst
its
lid
dawn
kissed
her
doll
cracked
face
it
shone
but
laughing
curse
is
vii
so
she
sleeps
well
she
does
not
move
and
on
the
wall
the
chair
the
bed
is
it
the
dawn
that
splashes
red
high
as
the
text
where
is
hangs
her
head
she
does
not
move
viii
the
clock
dictates
its
old
refrain
all
else
is
quiet
or
far
away
shaking
the
world
with
day
there
thunders
past
some
mighty
train
the
clock
dictates
its
old
refrain
ix
the
dawn
peers
in
with
eyes
the
crust
the
broken
cup
are
there
she
does
not
rise
yet
to
prepare
her
scanty
meal
god
does
not
rise
and
pluck
the
sheet
from
her
but
dawn
peers
in
with
haggard
eyes
the
invitation
i
upon
a
time
ah
now
the
light
is
burning
dimly
peterkin
is
here
again
he
wants
another
tale
do
you
hear
him
whispering
wind
is
in
the
chimley
the
ottoman
a
we
all
set
sail
ii
all
set
sail
no
the
wind
is
very
loud
the
darkness
on
the
waters
is
much
deeper
than
of
yore
yet
i
wonder
hark
he
whispers
if
the
little
streets
are
still
as
bright
in
old
japan
in
old
japan
that
happy
haunted
shore
iii
i
wonder
hush
he
whispers
if
perhaps
the
world
will
wake
again
when
christmas
brings
the
stories
back
from
where
the
skies
are
blue
where
clouds
are
scattering
diamonds
down
on
every
cottage
and
every
boy
a
fairy
prince
and
every
tale
is
true
iv
there
the
sword
excalibur
is
thrust
into
the
dragon
throat
evil
there
is
evil
black
is
black
and
white
is
white
there
the
child
triumphant
hurls
the
villain
spluttering
into
the
moat
there
the
captured
princess
only
waits
the
peerless
knight
v
fairyland
is
gleaming
there
beyond
the
sherwood
forest
trees
there
the
city
of
the
clouds
has
anchored
on
the
plain
all
her
misty
vistas
and
palaces
we
not
ah
shall
we
not
wander
there
again
vi
happy
ever
after
there
the
lights
of
home
a
welcome
fling
softly
thro
the
darkness
as
the
star
that
shone
of
old
softly
over
bethlehem
and
the
little
cradled
king
whom
the
sages
worshipped
with
their
frankincense
and
gold
vii
upon
a
perhaps
a
hundred
thousand
years
ago
whisper
to
me
peterkin
i
have
forgotten
when
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
way
a
way
we
used
to
know
for
stealing
off
at
twilight
from
the
weary
ways
of
men
viii
whisper
it
o
whisper
it
the
way
the
way
is
all
i
need
all
the
heart
and
will
are
here
and
all
the
deep
desire
upon
a
ah
now
the
light
is
drawing
near
indeed
i
see
the
fairy
faces
flush
to
roses
round
the
fire
ix
upon
a
the
little
lips
are
on
my
cheek
again
little
fairy
fingers
clasped
and
clinging
draw
me
nigh
dreams
no
more
than
dreams
but
they
unloose
the
weary
prisoner
chain
and
lead
him
from
his
dungeon
what
a
thousand
years
they
cry
x
a
thousand
years
a
thousand
years
a
little
drifting
dream
ago
all
of
us
were
hunting
with
a
band
of
merry
men
the
skies
were
blue
the
boughs
were
green
the
clouds
were
crisping
isles
of
snow
so
robin
blew
his
bugle
and
the
now
became
the
then
the
tramp
transfigured
an
episode
in
the
life
of
a
millionaire
i
all
the
way
to
fairyland
across
the
thyme
and
heather
round
a
little
bank
of
fern
that
rustled
on
the
sky
me
and
stick
and
bundle
sir
we
jogged
along
together
changeable
the
weather
well
it
ai
all
pie
just
about
the
sunset
wo
you
listen
to
my
story
look
at
me
i
only
rags
and
tatters
to
your
eye
sir
that
blooming
sunset
crowned
this
battered
hat
with
glory
me
that
was
a
crawling
worm
became
a
butterfly
ai
it
hot
and
dry
thank
you
sir
thank
you
sir
a
blooming
butterfly
ii
well
it
happened
this
way
i
was
lying
loose
and
lazy
just
as
of
a
sunday
you
yourself
might
think
no
shame
puffing
little
clouds
of
smoke
and
picking
at
a
daisy
dreaming
of
your
dinner
or
wishful
for
the
same
suddenly
around
that
ferny
bank
there
slowly
waddled
slowly
as
the
finger
of
a
clock
her
shadow
came
slowly
as
a
tortoise
down
that
winding
path
she
toddled
leaning
on
a
crookèd
staff
a
poor
old
crookèd
dame
limping
but
not
lame
tack
tick
a
poor
old
crookèd
dame
iii
slowly
did
i
say
sir
well
you
heard
that
funny
fable
consekint
the
tortoise
and
the
race
it
give
an
this
was
curiouser
than
that
at
first
i
was
able
quite
to
size
the
memory
up
that
bristled
thro
my
hair
suddenly
i
got
it
with
a
nasty
shivery
feeling
while
she
walked
and
walked
and
yet
was
not
a
bit
more
near
sir
it
was
the
earth
beneath
her
feet
faster
than
her
feet
could
trot
to
heaven
or
anywhere
earth
revolvin
stair
wheeling
while
my
wayside
clump
was
kind
of
anchored
there
iv
tack
tick
and
just
a
little
nearer
inch
and
an
inch
she
went
but
never
gained
a
yard
quiet
as
a
fox
i
lay
i
did
wish
to
scare
watching
thro
the
ferns
and
thinking
what
a
rum
old
card
both
her
wrinkled
tortoise
eyes
with
yellow
resin
oozing
both
her
poor
old
bony
hands
were
red
and
seamed
and
scarred
lord
i
felt
as
if
myself
was
in
a
public
boozing
while
my
own
old
woman
went
about
and
scrubbed
and
charred
lord
it
seemed
so
hard
tack
tick
she
never
gained
a
yard
v
yus
and
there
in
front
of
her
i
had
seen
it
rightly
lurked
that
little
to
point
another
road
just
a
tiny
path
of
poppies
twisting
through
the
whispering
seas
of
wheat
a
scarlet
thread
that
showed
white
with
daisies
here
and
there
and
chalky
cobbles
blue
with
waving
far
and
far
away
it
glowed
winding
into
heaven
i
thinks
but
lord
the
way
she
hobbles
lord
she
never
reach
it
for
she
bears
too
great
a
load
yus
and
then
i
knowed
if
she
did
she
could
for
the
board
was
marked
vi
tack

i
could
wait
no
longer

dreading

stop
to
answer

smilingly
she
eyed
me
dreadful

low
cunning
of
these
creechars

weather

derned
old

big

and
a
bottle
just
as
i
expected

throttle

you
make
no

of
it
the

that
you
look
sir
all
your
ancient

tell
you
just
the

as
me
what
about
old

his

indecent
book

morphosizing
females
into

what
about
old
proteus

his
curious
mixing
of

about
old
darwin

trotted
even
to

with
my
what

crikey
feelers
you
know
how
the
man
born
blind
described
such
colours
as
scarlet
or
blue
xxviii
scarlet
he
says
is
the
sound
of
a
trumpet
blue
is
a
flute
for
he
has
a
notion
no
nor
nobody
living
on
earth
can
tell
it
him
plain
if
he
has
the
sight
that
how
it
stands
with
ragged

on
a
measureless
ocean
gifted
wi
fifteen
senses

seeing
you
blind

how
can
i
tell
you
sir
you
must
wait
till
you
die
like
bill
ere
you
understand
it

the

bee
that
strikes
to
his
hive
ten
leagues
away
straight
as
a
die

i
winked
and

on
that
wood

my
wings
expanded
whistler
drawings
that
men
call
wings

i
flew

all
i
can
say
xxx

over
leagues
of
whispering
wonder
fairy
forests

delicate

once

i
seemed
to
wake
the
vision
it
had
fled
sir
there
i
lay
upon
the
downs
the
sky
was
like
a
peach
yus
with
twelve
bokays
of
blue
beside
my
bed
sir
more
than
usual
so
they
bring
me
each
easy
as
a
poet
dreams
they
blossomed
round
my
head
sir
all
i
had
to
do
was
just
to
lift
my
hand
and
reach
tie
with
a
bit
of
string
and
earn
my
blooming
bread
sir
selling
little
on
the
brighton
beach
a
speech
all
about
the
bright
blue
eyes
they
matched
on
brighton
beach
xxxvi
overhead
the
singing
lark
and
underfoot
the

along

if
she
wants
to
quarrel
if
her
eyes
begin
to
flash

fly
you

my

to
squeeze
toffs
get
no
chance
of

take
in
the
lump
never
laid
in
when
the
dawn
came
sir
guess
it
true
that
story
the
needle
and
the
hump
never
crept
into
a
stack
because
the
wind
was
blowing
hollered
out
a
nest
and
closed
the
with
a
clump
laid
and
heard
the
whisper
of
the
silence
growing
growing
watched
a
thousand
wheeling
stars
and
wondered
if
they
bump
what
i
say
would
stump
joshua
but
i
done
it
sir
do
think
i
off
my
chump
xxxviii
if
you
try
and
lay
sir
with
your
face
turned
up
to
wonder
up
to
twenty
million
miles
of
stars
that
roll
like
one
right
across
to
god
knows
where
and
you
just
huddled
under
like
a
little
beetle
with
no
business
of
his
own
there
you
hear
like
growing
grass
a
funny
silent
sound
sir
mixed
with
curious
crackles
in
a
steady
undertone
just
the
sound
of
twenty
billion
stars
round
sir
yus
and
you
beneath
like
a
wise
old
ant
alone
ant
upon
a
stone
waving
of
his
antlers
on
the
sussex
downs
alone
on
the
downs
our
childhood
roamed
the
world
in
blowing
grass
and
watched
the
white
clouds
crisply
curled
above
the
and
lay
among
the
purple
thyme
and
from
its
fragrance
caught
strange
hints
from
some
elusive
clime
beyond
the
bounds
of
thought
glimpses
of
fair
forgotten
things
beyond
the
gates
of
birth
from
far
off
ancient
springs
in
heaven
and
half
of
earth
and
coloured
like
a
and
whispering
evermore
half
memories
from
the
pale
of
lives
we
lived
before
here
weary
of
the
roaring
town
may
i
return
and
while
the
west
wind
roams
the
down
lie
still
lie
still
and
learn
here
are
green
leagues
of
murmuring
wheat
with
blue
skies
overhead
and
all
around
the
winds
are
sweet
with
white
and
red
and
to
and
fro
the
bee
still
hums
his
low
unchanging
song
and
the
same
rustling
whisper
comes
as
through
the
ages
long
through
all
the
thousands
of
the
years
that
same
sweet
rumour
flows
with
dreaming
skies
and
gleaming
tears
and
kisses
and
the
rose
once
more
the
children
throng
the
lanes
themselves
like
flowers
to
weave
their
garlands
and
their
and
listen
and
believe
the
tale
of
and
hear
the
and
chime
because
it
must
be
so
and
by
those
thousands
of
the
years
it
is
though
scarce
we
see
dazed
with
the
rainbows
of
our
tears
their
steadfast
unity
it
is
or
life
disjointed
schemes
these
stones
these
ferns
unfurled
with
such
deep
care
a
madman
dreams
were
wisdom
to
this
world
dust
into
dust
lie
still
and
learn
hear
how
the
ages
sing
the
solemn
joy
of
our
return
to
that
which
makes
the
spring
even
as
we
came
with
childhood
trust
we
go
to
thee
who
holdest
in
thy
sacred
dust
the
heavenly
springs
to
be
a
carol
what
is
the
loveliest
light
that
spring
rosily
parting
her
robe
of
grey
girdled
with
leaflet
green
can
fling
over
the
fields
where
her
white
feet
stray
what
is
the
merriest
promise
of
may
flung
the
april
flowers
tell
me
you
on
the
spray
of
birds
between
the
what
can
life
at
its
lightest
bring
better
than
this
on
its
brightest
day
how
should
we
fetter
the
wing
wild
with
joy
of
its
woodland
way
sweet
should
love
for
an
hour
delay
swift
while
the
is
ours
what
is
the
lover
royallest
lay
of
birds
between
the
what
is
the
murmur
of
bees
what
is
the
laugh
of
a
child
at
play
what
is
the
song
that
the
angels
sing
where
were
the
tune
could
the
sweet
notes
stay
longer
than
this
to
kiss
and
betray
nay
on
the
blue
sky
topmost
towers
what
is
the
song
of
the
seraphim
say
of
birds
between
the
thread
the
stars
on
a
silver
string
so
did
they
sing
in
bethlehem
bowers
mirth
for
a
little
one
grief
for
a
king
of
birds
between
the
the
call
of
the

and
away
my

come
choose
your
road
and
away

a
long
white
road
for
the
weary
but
it
rolls
through
the
heart
of
the
may
though
many
a
road
would
merrily
ring
to
the
tramp
of
your
marching
feet
all
roads
are
one
from
the
day
that
done
and
the
miles
are
swift
and
sweet
and
the
graves
of
your
friends
are
the
to
the
land
where
all
roads
meet
but
the
call
that
you
hear
this
day
my
lad
is
the
spring
old
bugle
of
mirth
when
the
year
green
fire
in
a
soul
desire
is
brought
like
a
rose
to
the
birth
and
knights
ride
out
to
adventure
as
the
flowers
break
out
of
the
earth
over
the
the
clouds
lie
brightly
curled
the
cling
to
the
crags
and
swing
with
impearled
and
the
way
the
way
that
you
choose
this
day
is
the
way
to
the
end
of
the
world
it
rolls
from
the
golden
long
ago
to
the
land
that
we
shall
find
and
it
uphill
here
but
it
downhill
there
for
the
road
is
wise
and
kind
and
all
rough
places
and
cheerless
faces
will
soon
be
left
behind
come
choose
your
road
and
away
away
we
follow
the
gipsy
sun
for
it
soon
too
soon
to
the
end
of
the
day
and
the
day
is
well
begun
and
the
road
rolls
on
through
the
heart
of
the
may
and
there
never
a
may
but
one
there
a
here
and
a
there
and
a
note
of
the
mating
dove
and
a
glimpse
maybe
of
the
warm
blue
sea
and
the
warm
white
clouds
above
and
warm
to
your
breast
in
a
tenderer
nest
your
sweetheart
little
glove
there
not
much
better
to
win
my
lad
there
not
much
better
to
win
you
have
lived
you
have
loved
you
have
fought
you
have
proved
the
worth
of
folly
and
sin
so
now
come
out
of
the
city
rout
come
out
of
the
dust
and
the
din
come
out
a
bundle
and
stick
is
all
you
need
to
carry
along
if
your
heart
can
carry
a
kindly
word
and
your
lips
can
carry
a
song
you
may
leave
the
lave
to
the
keep
o
the
grave
if
your
lips
can
carry
a
song
choose
your
road
and
away
my
lad
come
choose
your
road
and
away
we
out
of
the
town
by
the
road
bright
crown
as
it
dips
to
the
sapphire
day
all
roads
may
meet
at
the
world
end
but
hey
for
the
heart
of
the
may
come
choose
your
road
and
away
dear
lad
come
choose
your
road
and
a
devonshire
ditty
i
in
a
leafy
lane
of
devon
there
a
cottage
that
i
know
then
a
garden
then
a
grey
old
crumbling
wall
and
the
wall
the
wall
of
heaven
where
i
hardly
care
to
go
and
there
is
any
fiery
sword
at
all
ii
but
i
never
went
to
heaven
there
was
right
good
reason
why
for
they
sent
a
shining
angel
to
me
there
an
angel
down
in
devon
clad
in
muslin
by
the
bye
with
the
halo
of
the
sunshine
on
her
hair
iii
ah
the
darkness
covers
and
we
sing
or
say
would
you
climb
the
wall
of
heaven
an
hour
too
soon
if
you
knew
a
place
for
lovers
where
the
stray
out
of
heaven
to
sway
and
whisper
to
the
moon
iv
when
we
die
we
think
of
devon
where
the
garden
all
aglow
with
the
flowers
that
stray
across
the
grey
old
wall
then
we
climb
it
out
of
heaven
from
the
other
side
you
know
straggle
over
it
from
heaven
with
the
snow
tumble
back
again
to
devon
laugh
and
love
as
long
ago
where
there
is
any
fiery
sword
at
all
bacchus
and
the
pirates
half
a
hundred
terrible
pirates
famous
in
song
and
story
hoisting
the
old
black
flag
once
more
in
a
palmy
harbour
of
caribbee
farewell
we
waved
to
our
lasses
and
chorussing
out
to
the
billows
of
glory

with
rum
and
gold
we
followed
the

plunged

clung

we
suddenly
saw
had
we
seen
them
before
they
were
coloured
like
sand
or
the
pelt
on
his
shoulders
his
head
was
pillowed
on
two
great
leopards
whose
breathing
rose
and
sank
with
his
own
now
a
pirate
is
bold
but
the
vision
was
rum
and
would
for
rum
in
the
best
of
beholders
and
it
seemed
we
had
seen
him
before
in
a
dream
with
that
hair
and
that
crown
the
earth
went
round
and
the
rum
went
round
and
softlier
now
we
sung
half
a
hundred
pirates
when
the

was
young
now
timothy
hook
of
whom
ye
have
heard
with
his
talon
of
steel
our
doughty
skipper
a
man
that
in
youth
being
brought
up
pious
had
many
a
book
on
his
suddenly
caught
at
a
comrade
hand
with
the
tearing
claws
of
his
cold
steel
flipper
and
cried
great
thunder
and
brimstone
boys
i
hit
it
at
last
bacchus
the
earth
went
round
and
the
rum
went
round
and
never
a
word
we
sung
half
a
hundred
tottering
pirates
when
the
world
was
young
he
flung
his
french
cocked
hat
i
the
foam
though
its
lace
was
the
best
of
his
wearing
apparel
we
stared
at
him
bacchus
the
sea
reeled
round
like
a
splashing
with
purple
dreams
and
the
were
dashed
with
blood
of
the
grape
as
the
sun
like
a
barrel
flooded
the
tumbling
west
with
wine
and
spattered
the
clouds
with
crimson
gleams
the
earth
went
round
and
our
heads
went
round
and
never
a
word
we
sung
half
a
hundred
staggering
pirates
when
the
world
was
young
down
to
the
ship
for
a
our
crafty
hook
sent
silver
leaping
back
he
came
on
his
pounding
crutch
for
all
the
world
like
a
kangaroo
and
we
caught
the
net
and
up
to
the
sleeper
on
hands
and
knees
we
all
went
creeping
flung
it
across
him
and
staked
it
down
was
the
best
of
our
dreams
and
the
dream
was
true
the
earth
went
round
and
the
rum
went
round
and
loudly
now
we
sung
half
a
hundred
jubilant
pirates
when
the
world
was
young
we
had
caught
our
god
and
we
got
him
aboard
ere
he
woke
he
was
more
than
a
little
heavy
glittering
beautiful
flushed
he
lay
in
the
lurching
bows
of
the
old
black
barque
as
the
sunset
died
and
the
white
moon
dawned
and
we
saw
on
the
island
a
bevy
of
naked
bacchanals
stealing
to
watch
through
the
whispering
vines
in
the
purple
dark
earth
goes
round
let
rum
go
round
our
capstan
song
we
sung
half
a
hundred
innocent
pirates
when
the
world
was
young
beautiful
under
the
sailing
moon
in
the
tangled
net
with
the
leopards
beside
him
snared
like
a
wild
young
merman
wilful
petulant
flushed
he
lay
while
silver
and
hook
in
their
big
and
their
guarded
and
gleefully
eyed
him
thinking
what
bacchus
might
do
for
a
seaman
like
standing
him
drinks
as
a
man
might
say
earth
goes
round
let
rum
go
round
we
sailed
away
and
sung
half
a
hundred
fanciful
pirates
when
the
world
was
young
all
the
grog
that
ever
was
heard
of
gods
was
it
stowed
in
our
sure
possession
o
the
pictures
that
broached
the
skies
and
poured
their
colours
across
our
dreams
o
the
thoughts
that
tapped
the
sunset
and
rolled
like
a
great
torchlight
procession
down
our
throats
in
a
glory
of
glories
a
roaring
splendour
of
golden
streams
the
earth
went
round
and
the
stars
went
round
as
we
hauled
the
sheets
and
sung
half
a
hundred
infinite
pirates
when
the
world
was
young
beautiful
white
at
the
break
of
day
he
woke
and
the
net
in
a
smoke
dissolving
he
rose
like
a
flame
with
his
pards
and
his
hair
like
a
windy
dawn
and
the
crew
kept
back
respectful
like
till
the
leopards
advanced
with
their
eyes
revolving
then
up
the
rigging
went
silver
and
hook
and
the
rest
of
us
followed
with
drawn
earth
goes
round
let
rum
go
round
our
song
we
sung
half
a
hundred
terrified
pirates
when
the
world
was
young
and
take
me
home
to
my
happy
island
he
says
not
i
sings
hook
by
thunder
we
take
you
home
to
a
happier
isle
our
palmy
harbour
of
caribbee
you
wo
says
bacchus
and
quick
as
a
dream
the
planks
of
the
deck
just
heaved
asunder
and
a
mighty
vine
came
straggling
up
that
grew
from
the
depths
of
the
sea
the
sea
went
round
and
the
skies
went
round
as
our
song
we
sung
half
a
hundred
horrified
pirates
when
the
world
was
young
we
were
anchored
fast
as
an
oak
on
land
and
the
branches
clutched
and
the
tendrils
quickened
and
bound
us
writhing
like
snakes
to
the
spars
ay
we
hacked
with
our
knives
at
the
boughs
in
vain
and
bacchus
laughed
loud
on
the
decks
below
as
ever
the
tough
sprays
tightened
and
thickened
and
the
blazing
hours
went
by
and
we
gaped
with
thirst
and
our
ribs
were
racked
with
pain
the
skies
went
round
and
the
sea
swam
round
and
we
knew
not
what
we
sung
half
a
hundred
lunatic
pirates
when
the
world
was
young
bunch
upon
bunch
of
sunlike
grapes
as
we
writhed
and
struggled
and
raved
and
strangled
bunch
upon
bunch
of
gold
and
purple
daubed
its
bloom
on
our
baked
black
lips
clustering
grapes
o
bigger
than
pumpkins
just
out
of
reach
they
bobbed
and
dangled
over
the
sails
of
that
most
dumbfounded
of
pirate
ships
the
sun
went
round
and
the
moon
came
round
and
mocked
us
where
we
hung
half
a
hundred
maniac
pirates
when
the
world
was
young
over
the
waters
the
white
moon
winked
its
bruised
old
eye
at
our
bowery
prison
when
suddenly
we
were
aware
of
a
light
such
as
never
a
moon
or
a
ship
lamp
throws
and
a
shallop
of
pearl
like
a
nautilus
shell
came
shimmering
up
as
by
magic
arisen
with
sails
of
silk
and
a
glory
around
it
that
turned
the
sea
to
a
rippling
rose
our
heads
went
round
and
the
stars
went
round
at
the
song
that
cruiser
sung
half
a
hundred
pirates
when
the
world
was
young
half
a
hundred
bacchanals
hauled
the
ropes
of
that
rosy
cruiser
over
the
seas
they
came
and
laid
their
little
white
hands
on
the
old
black
barque
and
bacchus
he
ups
and
he
steps
aboard
hi
stop
cries
hook
you
frantic
old
boozer
belay
below
there
do
you
go
and
leave
poor
pirates
to
die
in
the
dark
the
moon
went
round
and
the
stars
went
round
as
they
all
pushed
off
and
sung
half
a
hundred
ribbonless
bacchanals
when
the
world
was
young
over
the
seas
they
went
and
bacchus
he
stands
with
his
leopards
beside
him
high
on
the
poop
of
rose
and
pearl
and
kisses
his
hand
to
us
pleasant
as
pie
while
the
bacchanals
danced
to
their
tambourines
and
the
flew
and
hook
just
eyed
him
once
as
a
man
that
was
brought
up
pious
and
scornfully
hollers
you
ai
shy
all
around
him
crowned
the
wild
white
bacchanals
flung
nor
it
was
a
sight
for
respectable
pirates
when
the
world
was
young
all
around
that
rippled
the
bloom
of
a
thousand
roses
nay
but
the
sparkle
of
fairy
breasting
a
sea
of
wine
swimming
around
it
in
murmuring
thousands
with
white
arms
tossing
till
all
that
knows
is
the
light
went
out
and
the
night
was
dark
and
the
grapes
had
burst
and
their
juice
was
brine
the
vines
that
bound
our
bodies
round
were
plain
wet
ropes
that
clung
squeezing
the
light
out
o
fifty
pirates
when
the
world
was
young
over
the
seas
in
the
pomp
of
dawn
a
king
ship
came
with
her
proud
flag
flying
cloud
upon
cloud
we
watched
her
tower
with
her
belts
and
her
crowded
zones
of
sail
and
an
perched
in
a
white
crow
nest
with
a
quietly
spying
as
we
swallowed
the
lumps
in
our
choking
throats
and
uttered
our
last
faint
feeble
hail
our
heads
went
round
as
the
ship
went
round
and
we
thought
how
coves
had
swung
all
for
playing
at
pirates
when
the
world
was
young
half
a
hundred
trembling
corsairs
all
cut
loose
but
a
trifle
giddy
we
lands
on
their
trim
white
decks
at
last
and
the
he
whistles
us
good
hot
grog
and
we
tries
to
confess
but
there
was
a
soul
from
the
self
to
the
middy
but
says
they
delirious
still
poor
chaps
and
the
he
enters
the
fact
in
his
log
his
boat
crew
found
us
nearly
drowned
in
a
barrel
without
a
bung
half
a
hundred
suffering
when
the
world
was
young
so
we
sailed
by
execution
dock
where
the
swinging
pirates
haughty
and
scornful
rattled
their
chains
and
on
margate
beach
we
came
like
a
safe
to
land
and
one
of
us
took
to
religion
at
once
and
the
rest
of
the
crew
their
hearts
were
mournful
capered

heavenly

for
the

if
this

be

in

to

of
spirit
woods

seas
with
eager
face
he
flees
and
treads
the
untrodden
fields
of
unknown
flowers
and
threads
the
angelic
bowers
and
hears
that
unheard
nightingale
whose
moan
trembles
within
his
own
and
lovers
murmuring
in
the
leafy
lanes
of
his
own
joys
and
pains
for
though
he
voyages
further
than
the
flight
of
earthly
day
and
night
traversing
to
the
sky
remotest
ends
a
world
that
he
transcends
safe
he
shall
hear
the
hidden
breakers
roar
against
the
mystic
shore
shall
roam
the
yellow
sands
where
sirens
bare
their
breasts
and
wind
their
hair
shall
with
their
perfumed
tresses
blind
his
eyes
and
still
possess
the
skies
he
where
the
deep
unearthly
jungles
are
beneath
his
eastern
star
shall
pass
the
tawny
lion
in
his
den
and
cross
the
quaking
fen
he
learnt
his
path
and
treads
it
undefiled
when
as
a
little
child
he
bent
his
head
with
long
and
loving
looks
earthly
his
earthly
love
nestles
against
his
side
his
young
celestial
guide
gorse
between
my
face
and
the
warm
blue
sky
the
crisp
white
clouds
go
sailing
by
and
the
only
sound
is
the
sound
of
your
breathing
the
song
of
a
bird
and
the
sea
long
sigh
here
on
the
downs
as
a
tale
the
sprays
of
the
gorse
are
with
gold
as
of
old
on
the
hills
of
my
boyhood
breathing
the
same
sweet
scent
as
of
old
under
a
ragged
golden
spray
the
great
sea
sparkles
far
away
beautiful
bright
as
my
heart
remembers
many
a
dazzle
of
waves
in
may
long
ago
as
i
watched
them
shine
under
the
boughs
of
fir
and
pine
here
i
watch
them
and
wonder
here
with
my
love
hand
warm
in
mine
the
soft
wings
pass
that
we
used
to
chase
dreams
that
i
dreamed
had
left
not
a
trace
the
same
the
same
with
the
bars
of
crimson
the
white
with
its
floating
grace
the
same
to
the
least
bright
fleck
on
their
wings
and
i
close
my
eyes
and
a
lost
bird
sings
and
a
far
sea
sighs
and
the
old
sweet
fragrance
wraps
me
round
with
the
dear
dead
springs
wraps
me
round
with
the
springs
to
be
when
lovers
that
think
not
of
you
or
me
laugh
but
our
eyes
will
be
closed
in
darkness
closed
to
the
sky
and
the
gorse
and
the
sea
and
the
same
great
glory
of
ragged
gold
once
more
once
more
as
a
tale
shall
whisper
their
hearts
with
the
same
sweet
fragrance
and
their
warm
hands
cling
as
of
old
as
of
old
dead
and
the
same
blue
skies
cover
us
love
as
i
read
your
eyes
do
i
not
know
whose
love
enfolds
us
as
we
fold
the
past
in
our
memories
past
present
future
the
old
and
the
new
from
the
depths
of
the
grave
a
cry
breaks
through
and
trembles
a
blind
in
the
azure
the
depths
of
the
blue
o
resurrection
of
folded
years
deep
in
our
hearts
with
your
smiles
and
tears
dead
and
shall
not
he
remember
who
folds
our
cry
in
his
heart
and
hears
for
the
eightieth
birthday
of
george
meredith
a
health
a
ringing
health
unto
the
king
of
all
our
hearts
but
what
proud
song
should
follow
on
the
thought
nor
do
him
wrong

the

lovely

him

immortal
cup
of
crimson

sun
at
the
white
feet
we
plucked
down
all
his
altars
not
to
make
the
small
praise
greater
but
the
great
praise
less
we
sealed
all
fountains
where
the
soul
could
slake
its
thirst
and
weariness
love
was
too
small
too
human
to
be
found
in
that
transcendent
source
whence
love
was
born
we
talked
of
forces
heaven
was
crowned
with
philosophic
thorn
your
god
is
in
your
image
we
cried
but
o
was
only
man
own
deepest
heart
ye
gave
knowing
that
he
transcended
all
ye
know
while
we
we
dug
his
grave
denied
him
even
the
crown
on
our
own
brow
these
poor
symbols
of
his
loftier
reign
levelled
his
temple
with
the
dust
and
now
he
is
risen
he
is
risen
again
risen
like
this
resurrection
of
the
year
this
grand
ascension
of
the
choral
spring
which
those
heavens
bend
to
hear
and
meet
upon
the
wing
he
is
dead
we
cried
and
even
amid
that
gloom
the
wintry
veil
was
rent
the
day
showed
us
the
angel
seated
in
the
tomb
and
the
stone
rolled
away
it
is
the
hour
we
challenge
heaven
above
now
to
deny
our
slight
ephemeral
breath
joy
anguish
and
that
everlasting
love
which
triumphs
over
death

he
rode
the

to

he
watched
his
wonderland
growing
cloud
by
magic
cloud
under

silvery
in

school
of
tenko

watched
him
young
and
proud

crown
a

in

bower
with
one
stroke
of

so
in

pale
as

glimmered
thro
soft

in

stole
she
willing
and
waning
frightened
and
unafraid
take
me
with
you
sawara
over
the
sea
she
said
small
and
sadly
beseeching
under
the
glimmered
her
face
like
a
drifting
over
the
sea
pale
as
a
drifting
blossom
lifted
her
face
to
his
eyes
slowly
he
gathered
and
held
her
under
the
drifting
skies
poor
little
face
cast
backward
better
to
see
his
own
earth
and
heaven
went
past
them
drifting
they
two
alone
stood
immortal
he
whispered
nothing
can
part
us
two
backward
her
sad
little
face
went
drifting

dreamed
it
true

strove
to
smile
let
me
follow
your
footsteps
your
slave

a

to
his
maiden

for
he
will
return
rich
as

down
to
their
dreams
of
the

as

wandered
down

in

drifting

weeping
desolate
blind

went
out
to
seek
her

the

plucked
from
his
two
big
paper
lanterns
and
ran
to
the
brink
of
the
sea
over
his
head
he
held
them
crying
and
only
heard
somewhere
out
in
the
darkness
the
cry
of
a
wandering
bird

had

to

anew
those
dim
isles
of
rose
and
blue
for
a
palace
far
away
under

he
said
to
tenko
and
he
painted
day
by
day
golden
visions
of
the
sea
no
he
had
not
come
to
woo
yet
had
kimi
proven
true
doubtless
he
had
loved
her
too
hardly
less
than
tenko

the
thought
was
in
his
head

would
make
his
choice
and

day
of
days
one
of
the
peacock
islands
out
in
the
sunset
haze
sails
on
the
water
carried
him
quickly
nigh
there
would
he
paint
him
a
wonder
worthy
of
hokusai

as
he
leapt
the
creaming
roses
of
faery
foam
out
of
the
caverns
under

backward
her
sad
white
face
lifted
up
to
sawara
once
in
that
lonely
place
white
as
a
drifting
blossom
under
his
wondering
eyes
slowly
he
gathered
and
held
her
under

lifted

much
impressed

straight
though
the
hour
was
growing
late
made
a
sketch
of

lying
by
the

brought
it
back
to

tenko
the
enchanted

i
i
remember
a
breath
a
breath
blown
thro
the
rosy
gates
of
birth
a
morning
freshness
not
of
the
earth
but
cool
and
strange
and
lovely
as
death
in
paradise
in
paradise
when
all
to
suffer
the
old
sweet
pain
closing
his
immortal
eyes
an
angel
lies
with
wings
of
grain
withering
till
ah
here
on
the
dawning
earth
again
he
wakes
a
little
child
ii
i
remember
a
gleam
a
gleam
of
sparkling
waves
and
warm
blue
sky
far
away
and
long
ago
or
ever
i
knew
that
youth
could
die
and
out
of
the
dawn
the
dawn
the
dawn
into
the
unknown
life
we
sailed
as
out
of
sleep
into
a
dream
and
as
with
elfin
cables
drawn
in
dusk
of
purple
over
the
glowing
wrinkled
measureless
emerald
sea
the
light
cloud
shadows
larger
far
than
the
sweet
shapes
which
drew
them
on
elfin
exquisite
shadows
flowing
between
us
and
the
morning
star
chased
us
all
a
summer
day
and
our
sail
like
a
blossom
shone
till
over
a
rainbow
haze
of
spray
that
arched
a
reef
of
surf
like
snow
far
away
and
long
ago
we
saw
the
rosily
engrailed
with
tufted
peaks
above
a
smooth
lagoon
which
growing
growing
growing
as
we
sailed
curved
all
around
them
like
a
crescent
moon
and
then
we
saw
the
creeks
the
feathery
palms
the
gleaming
golden
streaks
of
sand
and
nearer
yet
like
jewels
of
fire
streaming
between
the
boughs
or
floating
higher
like
tiny
in
skies
the
birds
of
paradise
iii
the
island
floated
in
the
air
its
image
floated
in
the
sea
which
was
the
shadow
both
were
fair
like
sister
souls
they
seemed
to
be
and
one
was
dreaming
and
asleep
and
one
bent
down
from
paradise
to
kiss
with
radiance
in
the
deep
the
darkling
lips
and
eyes
and
mingling
softly
in
their
dreams
that
holy
kiss
of
sea
and
sky
transfused
the
shadows
and
the
gleams
of
time
and
of
eternity
the
dusky
face
looked
up
and
gave
to
heaven
its
golden
shadowed
calm
the
face
of
light
fulfilled
the
wave
with
blissful
wings
and
fans
of
palm
above
the
tufted
rosy
peaks
that
melted
in
the
warm
blue
skies
below
the
creeks
that
glassed
the
birds
of
paradise
a
bridal
knot
it
hung
in
heaven
and
all
around
the
still
lagoon
from
bloom
of
dawn
to
blush
of
even
curved
like
a
crescent
moon
and
there
we
wandered
evermore
thro
boyhood
everlasting
years
listening
the
murmur
of
the
shore
as
one
that
lifts
a
shell
and
hears
the
murmur
of
forgotten
seas
around
some
lost
broceliande
the
sigh
of
sweet
eternities
that
turn
the
world
to
that
turned
our
isle
to
a
single
pearl
glowing
in
measureless
waves
of
wine
above
below
the
clouds
would
curl
above
below
the
stars
would
shine
in
sky
and
sea
we
hung
in
heaven
time
and
space
were
but
pools
for
the
dawn
and
even
to
wade
with
their
rosy
feet
our
pirate
cavern
faced
the
west
we
closed
its
door
with
screens
of
palm
while
some
went
out
to
seek
the
nest
wherein
the
phoenix
breathing
balm
burns
and
dies
to
live
for
ever
how
should
we
dream
we
lived
to
die
and
some
would
fish
in
the
purple
river
that
thro
the
hills
brought
down
the
sky
and
some
would
dive
in
the
lagoon
like
sunbeams
and
all
round
our
isle
swim
thro
the
lovely
crescent
moon
glimpsing
for
breathless
mile
on
mile
the
wild
that
bloomed
below
the
rainbow
fish
the
coral
cave
where
vanishing
swift
as
melting
snow
a
mermaid
arm
would
wave
then
dashing
shoreward
thro
the
spray
on
sands
they
cast
them
down
or
in
the
white
lay
with
bodies
content
to
watch
the
flee
across
the
shelving
reefs
and
bars
with
wild
eyes
gazing
out
to
sea
like
happy
haunted
stars
iv
and
o
the
wild
drifting
through
the
starlit
air
with
white
arms
and
the
in
her
hair
sometimes
we
heard
her
singing
the
midnight
forest
through
or
saw
a
soft
hand
flinging
blossoms
drenched
with
starry
dew
into
the
dreaming
purple
cave
and
sometimes
far
and
far
away
beheld
across
the
glooming
wave
beyond
the
dark
lagoon
beyond
the
silvery
foaming
bar
the
black
bright
rock
whereon
she
lay
like
a
star
singing
to
the
breathless
moon
singing
in
the
silent
night
till
the
stars
for
sheer
delight
closed
their
eyes
and
drowsy
birds
in
the
midmost
forest
spray
took
their
heads
from
out
their
wings
thinking
it
is
ariel
sings
and
we
must
catch
the
witching
words
and
sing
them
by
day
v
and
then
there
came
a
breath
a
breath
cool
and
strange
and
dark
as
death
a
stealing
shadow
not
of
the
earth
but
fresh
and
as
birth
i
know
not
when
the
hour
began
that
changed
the
child
heart
in
the
man
or
when
the
colours
began
to
wane
but
all
our
roseate
island
lay
stricken
as
when
an
angel
dies
with
wings
of
grain
withering
and
his
radiant
eyes
closing
pitiless
walls
of
grey
gathered
around
us
a
growing
tomb
from
which
it
seemed
not
death
or
doom
could
roll
the
stone
away
vi
yet
i
remember
a
gleam
a
gleam
or
ever
i
dreamed
that
youth
could
die
of
sparkling
waves
and
warm
blue
sky
as
out
of
sleep
into
a
dream
for
the
old
sweet
pain
we
sailed
into
that
unknown
sea
through
the
gates
of
eternity
peacefully
close
your
mortal
eyes
for
ye
shall
wake
to
it
again
in
paradise
in
paradise
unity
i
heart
of
my
heart
the
world
is
young
love
lies
hidden
in
every
rose
every
song
that
the
skylark
sung
once
we
thought
must
come
to
a
close
now
we
know
the
spirit
of
song
song
that
is
merged
in
the
chant
of
the
whole
hand
in
hand
as
we
wander
along
what
should
we
doubt
of
the
years
that
roll
ii
heart
of
my
heart
we
can
not
die
love
triumphant
in
flower
and
tree
every
life
that
laughs
at
the
sky
tells
us
nothing
can
cease
to
be
one
we
are
one
with
a
song
one
with
the
clover
that
scents
the
wold
one
with
the
unknown
far
away
one
with
the
stars
when
earth
grows
old
iii
heart
of
my
heart
we
are
one
with
the
wind
one
with
the
clouds
that
are
whirled
the
lea
one
in
many
o
broken
and
blind
one
as
the
waves
are
at
one
with
the
sea
ay
when
life
seems
scattered
apart
darkens
ends
as
a
tale
that
is
told
one
we
are
one
o
heart
of
my
heart
one
still
one
while
the
world
grows
old
the
is
my
faith
that
every
flower
enjoys
the
air
it
so
was
it
sung
one
golden
hour
among
the
woodbine
wreaths
and
yet
though
wet
with
living
dew
the
song
seemed
far
more
sweet
than
true
blind
creatures
of
the
sun
and
air
i
dreamed
it
but
a
dream
that
like
narcissus
would
confer
with
self
in
every
stream
and
to
the
leaves
and
boughs
impart
the
tremors
of
a
human
heart
a
golden
pinion
stirred
the
world
bethesda
pool
and
i
believed
the
song
i
heard
nor
put
my
heart
to
school
and
through
the
rainbows
of
the
dream
i
saw
the
gates
of
eden
gleam
the
rain
had
ceased
the
great
hills
rolled
in
silence
to
the
deep
the
gorse
in
waves
of
green
and
gold
perfumed
their
lonely
sleep
and
at
my
feet
one
elfin
flower
drooped
blind
with
glories
of
the
shower
i
stooped
a
giant
from
the
sky
above
its
piteous
shield
and
suddenly
the
dream
went
by
and
there
was
heaven
revealed
i
stooped
to
pluck
it
but
my
hand
paused
its
fairyland
not
of
mine
own
was
that
strange
voice
pluck
tear
a
star
from
heaven
mine
only
was
the
awful
choice
to
scoff
and
be
forgiven
or
hear
the
very
grass
i
trod
whispering
the
gentle
thoughts
of
god
i
know
not
if
the
place
beneath
that
mighty
sky
its
lonely
and
aspiring
grace
its
beauty
born
to
die
touched
me
i
know
it
seemed
to
be
cherished
by
all
eternity
man
doomed
to
crush
at
every
stride
a
hundred
lives
like
this
which
by
their
weakness
were
allied
if
by
naught
else
to
his
can
only
for
a
flash
discern
what
passion
through
the
whole
doth
yearn
not
into
words
can
i
distil
the
pity
or
the
pain
which
hallowing
all
that
lonely
hill
cried
out

refrain
then
breathed
from
earth

you
did
it
unto
me
somewhile
that
hill

breast
the
flower
its
joy
and
grief
hugged
close
and
fostered
and
caressed
in
every
brief
bright
leaf

ere
i
went
thro

i
leant
and
gently
touched
it

stood

the

olivets
where
beethoven
walked
and
talked
with
god
we
that
have
weighed
the
stars
and
reined
the
lightning
we
that
stare
thro
heaven
and
plant
our
footsteps
in
the
sea
we
whose
great
souls
have
risen
so
far
above
the
creeds
that
we
can
jest
at
christ
and
leave
him
where
he
bleeds
a
legend
of
the
dark
a
tale
so
false
or
true
that
we
jest
at
him
the
jest
sounds
new
our
weariest
never
tire
of
that
let
the
clown
sport
with
christ
never
the
jest
falls
flat
poor
fools
we
dare
not
dream
a
dream
so
strange
so
great
as
on
this
ball
of
dust
to
found
one
state
to
float
one
common
flag
above
our
little
lands
and
ere
our
little
sun
grows
cold
to
clasp
our
hands
in
friendship
for
a
moment
hark
the
violins
are
swooning
through
the
mist
the
great
blue
band
begins
playing
in
dainty
scorn
a
hymn
we
used
to
know
how
long
was
it
ten
thousand
thousand
years
ago
is
a
green
hill
far
away
beside
a
city
wall
and
o
the
music
swung
with
a
solemn
dying
fall
for
it
was
a
pleasant
jest
to
play
hymns
in
the
devil
hall
and
yet
and
yet
if
aught
be
true
this
dream
we
left
behind
this
childish
christ
anew
to
please
the
men
of
mind
yet
hung
so
far
beyond
the
flight
of
our
most
lofty
thought
that
lucifer
laughed
us
that
night
not
us
as
he
ought
beneath
the
lamp
of
mars
cloaked
with
a
scarlet
cloud
he
gazed
along
the
line
of
stars
above
the
guzzling
crowd
sinister
he
raised
his
great
eyes
and
on
some
distant
vision
gazed
beyond
our
cloudy
skies
he
sneered
civilisation
noon
poor
wolves
that
hunt
in
packs
and
bark
beneath
the
grinning
moon
poor
fools
that
cast
the
cross
away
before
they
break
the
sword
poor
sots
who
take
the
night
for
day
have
mercy
on
me
their
wisdom

i
see
thee
hanging
yet
the
love
still
hungering
in
thine
eyes
thy
plaited
crown
still
wet
thine
arms
outstretched
to
fold
them
all
beneath
thy
sheltering
breast
but
since
they
will
not
hear
thy
call

i
forbear
to
i
forbear
the
day
i
fell
i
fell
at

thro

rather
than
these
should

me

o
let
me

thy
cross
of
grief
and
let
me
work
thy

as

thief
thy
fallen

i
forbear
for
thee
at

in

so
like
to
mine
the
mighty

is
plain

seemed
infinite

seemed

walked

once
the
silent

me
where
singing
was

cynic

dead
years

my
lost
too
soon
to
lose

everlasting

it
seemed

pure

while
i
linger
on

nought
seems

beyond

consummate
heaven
the
first

enfolding
in

prime
no

rushing

but
one
rapt
now
that
knew
not
space
or
time
formless
it
was
being
gold
on
gold
and
void
but
with
that
complete
life
where
music
could
no
wings
unfold
till
lo
god
smote
the
strings
of
strife
myself
unto
myself
am
throne
myself
unto
myself
am
thrall
i
that
am
all
am
all
alone
he
said
yea
i
have
nothing
having
all
and
gathering
round
his
mount
of
bliss
the
of
his
will
he
said
one
battle
yet
there
is
to
win
one
vision
to
fulfil
since
heaven
i
gaze
expands
and
power
that
knows
no
strife
or
cry
weakness
shall
bind
and
pierce
my
hands
and
make
a
world
for
me
wherein
to
die
all
might
all
vastness
and
all
glory
being
mine
i
must
descend
and
make
out
of
my
heart
a
song
a
story
of
little
hearts
that
burn
and
break
out
of
my
passion
without
end
i
will
make
little
azure
seas
and
into
small
sad
fields
descend
and
make
green
grass
white
daisies
rustling
trees
then
shrank
his
angels
knowing
he
thrust
his
arms
out
east
and
west
and
gave
for
every
little
dream
of
dust
part
of
his
life
as
to
a
grave
o
father
for
thy
words
have
pierced
thy
hands
but
low
and
sweet
he
said
sunsets
and
streams
and
birds
and
drifting
clouds
the
purple
stained
his
enough
his
angels
moaned
in
fear
thy
words
have
pierced
thy
side
he
whispered
roses
shall
grow
there
and
there
must
be
a
and
ferns
dewy
at
dawn
and
still
they
moaned
the
red
drops
bleed
and
sweet
and
low
on
every
hill
he
said
i
will
have
flocks
and
lambs
to
lead
his
angels
bowed
their
heads
beneath
their
wings
till
that
great
pang
was
gone
not
thy
soul
out
unto
death
they
moaned
and
still
his
love
flowed
on
there
shall
be
small
white
wings
to
stray
from
bliss
to
bliss
from
bloom
to
bloom
and
blue
flowers
in
the
wheat
and
speak
they
cried
word
that
seals
thy
tomb
he
spake
i
have
thought
of
a
little
child
that
i
will
have
there
to
embark
on
small
adventures
in
the
wild
and
front
slight
perils
in
the
dark
and
i
will
hide
from
him
and
lure
his
laughing
eyes
with
suns
and
moons
and
rainbows
that
shall
not
endure
and
when
he
is
weary
sing
him
drowsy
tunes
his
angels
fell
before
him
weeping
tempt
not
the
gates
of
hell
he
said
his
soul
is
in
his
keeping
that
we
may
love
each
other
well
and
lest
the
dark
too
much
affright
him
i
will
strow
countless
little
stars
across
his
childish
skies
to
light
him
that
he
may
wage
in
peace
his
mimic
wars
and
oft
forget
me
as
he
plays
with
swords
and
childish
merchandize
or
with
his
elfin
balance
weighs
or
with
his
metes
the
skies
or
builds
his
castles
by
the
deep
or
tunnels
through
the
rocks
and
then
turn
to
me
as
he
falls
asleep
and
in
his
dreams
feel
for
my
hand
again
and
when
he
is
older
he
shall
be
my
friend
and
walk
here
at
my
side
or
when
he
wills
grow
young
with
me
and
to
that
happy
world
where
once
we
died
descending
through
the
calm
blue
weather
buy
life
once
more
with
our
immortal
breath
and
wander
through
the
little
fields
together
and
taste
of
love
and
death
the
peacemaker
silently
over
his
vast
imperial
seas
over
his
sentinel
fleets
the
shadow
swept
and
all
his
armies
slept
there
was
but
one
quick
challenge
at
the
gate
then
the
cold
menace
of
that
hand
waving
aside
the
panoplies
of
state
brought
the
last
faithful
watchers
to
their
knees
and
lightning
flashed
the
grief
from
land
to
land

not
for

this

doom

all

our

the
roll
of
the
drums
that
for
battle
were
dumb
when

reigned
salute
his
passing
and
low
on
the
breeze
from
the
north
to
the
australasian
seas
surges
the
solemn
lament
o
shall
it
not
come
a
glimpse
of
that
mightier
union
of
all
mankind
now
though
our
eyes
as
they
gaze
on
the
vision
grow
blind
now
while
the
world
is
all
one
funeral
knell
and
the
mournful
cannon
thunder
his
great
farewell
now
while
the
bells
of
a

cities
toll
remember
o

remember
the
ageless
goal
rally
the

faith

up
thine

to
the

which

fought
that
empire
of
peace

for
which
to

the
pomp

the

farewell
with
my
fiddle
to

my
hair
turning
grey
and
my
heart
growing
older
i
must
shuffle
on
my
way
tho
there
not
a
hearth
to
greet
me
i
must
reap
as
i
sowed
and
the
sunset
shall
meet
me
at
the
turn
of
the
road
o
the
whin
a
dusky
yellow
and
the
road
a
rosy
white
and
the
blackbird
call
is
mellow
at
the
falling
of
night
and
there
honey
in
the
heather
where
we
make
our
last
abode
my
tunes
and
me
together
at
the
turn
of
the
road
i
have
fiddled
for
your
city
thro
and
inn
i
have
poured
forth
my
pity
on
your
sorrow
and
your
sin
but
your
riches
are
your
burden
and
your
pleasure
is
your
goad
i
the
for
guerdon
at
the
turn
of
the
road
your
call
me
as
the
lights
of
home
the
dead
but
a
black
night
befall
me
ere
your
pillows
rest
my
head
god
be
praised
tho
like
a
jewel
every
cottage
casement
showed
there
a
star
that
not
so
cruel
at
the
turn
of
the
road
nay
beautiful
and
kindly
are
the
faces
drawing
nigh
but
i
gaze
on
them
blindly
and
hasten
hasten
by
for
o
no
face
of
wonder
on
earth
has
ever
glowed
like
the
one
that
waits
me
yonder
at
the
turn
of
the
road
her
face
is
lit
with
splendour
she
dwells
beyond
the
skies
but
deep
deep
and
tender
are
the
tears
in
her
eyes
the
angels
see
them
glistening
in
pity
for
my
load
and
she
waiting
there
she
listening
at
the
turn
of
the
road
to
a
pessimist
life
like
a
cruel
mistress
woos
the
passionate
heart
of
man
you
say
only
in
mockery
to
refuse
his
love
at
last
and
turn
away
to
me
she
seems
a
queen
that
knows
how
great
is
love
but
ah
how
rare
and
pointing
heavenward
ere
she
goes
gives
him
the
rose
from
out
her

this
poem
commemorates
an
event
of
some
years
ago
when
a
young
englishman
still
remembered
by
many
of
his
contemporaries
at
oxford
went
up
into
mount
ida
and
was
never
seen
again
i
not
cypress
but
this
warm
now
fragrant
with
sap
i
pluck
nor
bid
you
weep
ye
muses
that
still
haunt
the
heavenly
brow
of
ida
though
the
ascent
is
hard
and
steep
weep
not
for
him
who
left
us
wrapped
in
sleep
at
dawn
beneath
the
holy
mountain
breast
and
all
alone
from
ilion
gleaming
shore
clomb
the
high
glens
fain
to
drink
deep
of
earth
old
glory
from
your
silent
crest
take
the
throne
of
gods
and
gaze
alone
thro
heaven
darkling
we
slept
who
saw
his
face
no
more
ii
ah
yet
in
him
hath
lycidas
a
brother
and
adonaïs
will
not
say
him
nay
and
thyrsis
to
the
breast
of
one
sweet
mother
welcomes
him
climbing
by
the
way
quietly
as
a
cloud
at
break
of
day
up
the
long
glens
of
golden
dew
he
stole
and
surely
bion
called
to
him
afar
the
tearful
hyacinths
and
the
greenwood
spray
clinging
to
keep
him
from
the
sapphire
goal
kept
of
his
path
no
trace
upward
the
yearning
face
clomb
the
ethereal
height
calm
as
the
morning
star
iii
ah
yet
incline
dear
sisters
or
my
song
that
with
the
light
wings
of
the
skimming
swallow
must
range
the
reedy
slopes
will
work
him
wrong
and
with
some
golden
shaft
do
thou
apollo
show
the
path
that
none
may
follow
for
as
the
blue
air
shuts
behind
a
bird
round
him
closed
ida
cloudy
woods
and
rills
by
echoing
height
and
hollow
we
called
him
but
our
tumult
died
unheard
down
from
the
scornful
sky
our
faint
cry
fluttered
and
perished
among
the
hills
iv
ay
though
we
clomb
each
peak
of
vision
nought
but
our
own
sad
faces
we
divined
thy
radiant
way
still
laughed
us
to
derision
and
still
revengeful
echo
proved
unkind
and
oft
our
faithless
hearts
half
feared
to
find
thy
cold
corse
in
some
dark
ravine
where
the
white
foam
flashed
headlong
to
the
sea
how
should
we
find
thee
spirits
deaf
and
blind
even
to
the
things
which
we
had
heard
and
seen
eyes
that
could
see
no
more
the
old
light
on
sea
and
shore
what
should
they
hope
or
fear
to
find
they
found
not
thee
v
for
thou
wast
ever
alien
to
our
skies
a
wistful
stray
of
radiance
on
this
earth
a
changeling
with
deep
memories
in
thine
eyes
mistily
gazing
thro
our
mirth
to
some
fair
land
beyond
the
gates
of
birth
yet
as
a
star
thro
clouds
thou
still
didst
shed
through
our
dark
world
thy
lovelier
rarer
glow
time
like
a
picture
of
but
little
worth
before
thy
young
hand
lifelessly
outspread
at
one
light
stroke
from
thee
gleamed
with
eternity
thou
the
master
touch
and
we
we
did
not
know
vi
not
though
we
gazed
from
heaven
ilion
dreaming
on
earth
below
mistily
crowned
with
towering
memories
and
beyond
her
shone
the
seas
achilles
heard
resound
only
and
after
many
days
we
found
dabbled
with
dew
at
border
of
a
wood
bedded
in
hyacinths
open
and
thy
homer
iliad
dryad
tears
had
drowned
the
rough
greek
type
and
as
with
honey
or
blood
one
crocus
with
crushed
gold
stained
the
great
page
that
told
of
gods
that
sighed
their
loves
on
ida
long
ago
vii
see
a
couch
to
their
ambrosial
limbs
even
as
their
golden
load
of
splendour
presses
the
fragrant
thyme
a
billowing
cloud
of
springing
flowers
beneath
their
deep
caresses
hyacinth
lotus
crocus
wildernesses
of
but
clouds
of
sunlight
and
of
dew
dropping
rich
balm
round
the
dark
curled
that
the
warm
wonder
of
their
tresses
and
all
the
secret
blisses
that
they
knew
where
beauty
kisses
truth
in
heaven
deep
heart
of
youth
might
still
be
hidden
as
thou
art
from
the
heartless
world
viii
even
as
we
found
thy
book
below
these
rocks
perchance
that
strange
great
eagle
feather
lay
when
ganymede
from
feeding
of
his
flocks
on
ida
vanished
thro
the
morning
grey
stranger
it
seemed
if
thou
couldst
cast
away
those
golden
musics
as
a
thing
of
nought
a
dream
for
which
no
longer
thou
hadst
need
ah
was
it
here
then
that
the
break
of
day
brought
thee
the
substance
for
the
shadow
taught
thy
soul
a
swifter
road
to
ease
it
of
its
load
and
watch
this
world
of
shadows
as
a
dream
recede
ix
we
slept
darkling
we
slept
our
busy
schemes
our
cold
mechanic
world
awhile
was
still
but
o
their
eyes
are
blinded
even
in
dreams
who
from
the
heavenlier
powers
withdraw
their
will
here
did
the
dawn
with
purer
light
fulfil
thy
happier
eyes
than
ours
here
didst
thou
see
the
quivering
in
flower
and
dew
the
quickening
glory
of
the
haunted
hill
the
hamadryad
beckoning
from
the
tree
the
naiad
from
the
stream
while
from
her
long
dark
dream
earth
woke
trembling
with
life
light
beauty
through
and
through
x
and
the
everlasting
miracle
of
things
flowed
round
thee
and
this
dark
earth
opposed
no
bar
and
radiant
faces
from
the
flowers
and
springs
dawned
on
thee
whispering
thou
we
faintly
thou
heardst
us
calling
thee
afar
as
hylas
heard
swooning
beneath
the
wave
girdled
with
glowing
arms
while
wood
and
glen
echoed
his
name
beneath
that
rosy
star
and
thy
farewell
came
faint
as
from
the
grave
for
very
bliss
but
we
could
neither
hear
nor
see
and
all
the
hill
with
hylas
rang
again
xi
but
there
were
deeper
for
thine
ears
than
theocritus
could
tell
over
him
like
a
sea
two
thousand
years
had
swept
they
solemnized
his
music
well
farewell
what
word
could
answer
but
farewell
from
thee
o
happy
spirit
that
couldst
steal
so
quietly
from
this
world
at
break
of
day
what
voice
of
ours
could
break
the
silent
spell
beauty
had
cast
upon
thee
or
reveal
the
gates
of
sun
and
dew
which
oped
and
let
thee
through
and
led
thee
heavenward
by
that
deep
enchanted
way
xii
yet
here
thou
thy
choice
love
wisdom
power
as
once
before
young
paris
they
stood
here
beneath
them
ida
like
one
flower
shed
her
bloom
earthward
thro
the
radiant
air
leaving
her
rounded
fruit
their
beauty
bare
to
the
everlasting
dawn
and
in
thy
palm
the
golden
apple
of
the
hesperian
isle
which
thou
must
only
yield
to
the
most
fair
but
not
to
juno
great
luxurious
calm
nor
dian
curved
white
moon
thou
the
sunset
boon
nor
to
aphrodite
smile
xiii
here
didst
thou
make
the
eternal
choice
aright
here
in
this
hallowed
haunt
of
nymph
and
faun
they
stood
before
thee
in
that
great
new
light
the
three
great
splendours
of
the
immortal
dawn
with
all
the
cloudy
veils
of
time
withdrawn
or
only
glistening
round
the
firm
white
snows
of
their
pure
beauty
like
the
golden
dew
brushed
from
the
feathery
ferns
below
the
lawn
but
not
to
cold
diana
morning
rose
nor
to
great
juno
frown
cast
thou
the
apple
down
and
when
the
paphian
raised
her
lustrous
eyes
anew
xiv
thou
from
thy
soul
didst
whisper
that
heaven
which
yearns
beyond
us
lead
me
up
the
height
how
should
the
golden
fruit
to
one
be
given
till
your
three
splendours
in
that
sun
unite
where
each
in
each
ye
move
like
light
in
light
how
should
i
judge
the
rapture
till
i
know
the
pain
and
like
three
waves
of
music
there
they
closed
thee
round
blinding
thy
blissful
sight
with
beauty
and
like
one
roseate
orb
they
bore
thee
on
their
breasts
up
the
crests
and
melted
with
thee
smiling
into
the
most
fair
xv
upward
and
onward
ever
as
ye
went
the
cities
of
the
world
nestled
beneath
closer
as
if
in
love
round
ida
blent
with
alien
hills
in
one
great
of
clouds
while
breathing
with
your
breath
new
heavens
mixed
with
your
mounting
bliss
deep
eyes
beautiful
eyes
imbrued
with
the
world
tears
dawned
on
you
beautiful
gleams
of
love
and
death
flowed
thro
your
questioning
with
divine
replies
from
that
ineffable
height
dark
with
excess
of
light
where
the
dies
and
the
hears
xvi
for
thou
hadst
seen
what
tears
upon
man
face
bled
from
the
heart
or
burned
from
out
the
brain
and
not
denied
or
cursed
but
couldst
embrace
infinite
sweetness
in
the
heart
of
pain
and
heardst
those
universal
choirs
again
wherein
like
waves
of
one
harmonious
sea
all
our
slight
dreams
of
heaven
are
singing
still
and
still
the
throned
olympians
swell
the
strain
and
hark
the
burden
of
all
unto
me
sky
into
deepening
sky
melts
with
that
one
great
cry
and
the
lost
doves
of
ida

on

xvii
i
gather
all
the
ages
in
my
song
and
send
them
singing
up
the
heights
to
thee
chord
by

the
stars
prolong
their
passionate
echoes
to
eternity

and
one
orchestral
symphony
sweeps
the
quivering
of
mankind
grief
modulates
into

strife
now
but
of
love
in

great

farewell

thro

sir
john

sheriff
i
know
not
sir
but
he
was
caught
killing
the
king
deer
by
the
forest
law
he
should
of
rights
be
blinded
for
as
you
see
indicates
the
serf
right

not
his
first
deer
at
king
richard
cost
john
save
you
trouble
if
you
say
at
mine
sheriff
ay
sir
i
pray
your
pardon
at
cost
his
right
hand
lacks
the
thumb
and
and
though
he
vows
it
was
a
falling
tree
that
crushed
them
you
may
trust
your
sheriff
sir
it
was
the
law
that
clipped
them
when
he
last
hunted
your
deer
serf
prince
when
the
conqueror
came
they
burned
my
father
homestead
with
the
rest
to
make
the
king
a
broader
i
have
hunted
there
for
food
how
could
i
bear
to
hear
my
hungry
children
crying
prince
they
make
good
bowmen
for
your
wars
one
day
john
he
is
much
too
fond
of
he
never
live
to
see
a
king
whose
thrall
his
iron
collar
look
is
the
name
not
on
it
sheriff
sir
the
name
is
filed
away
and
in
another
hour
the
ring
would
have
been
broken
he
is
one
of
those
green
adders
of
the
moon
thieves
whom
huntingdon
has
tempted
to
the
woods
these
desperate
ruffians
flee
their
lawful
masters
and
flock
around
the
disaffected
earl
like
ragged
rooks
around
an
elm
by
scores
and
now
i
faith
the
sun
of
huntingdon
is
setting
fast
they
well
nigh
beggared
him
eaten
him
out
of
house
and
home
they
say
that
when
we
make
him
outlaw
we
shall
find
nought
to
distrain
upon
but
empty
cupboards
john
did
you
not
serve
him
once
yourself
sheriff
oh
ay
he
was
more
prosperous
then
but
now
my
cupboards
are
full
and
his
are
bare
well
i
think
scorn
to
share
a
crust
with
outcast
churls
and
thieves
doffing
his
dignity
letting
them
call
him
robin
or
robin
hood
as
if
an
earl
were
just
a
plain
man
which
he
will
be
soon
when
we
have
served
our
writ
of
outlawry
is
said
he
hopes
much
from
the
king
return
and
swears
by
and
though
king
richard
is
brother
to
yourself
is
all
the
more
ungracious
sir
to
hope
he
should
return
and
overset
your
rule
but
then
to
keep
such
base
communications
myself
would
think
it
unworthy
of
my
sheriffship
much
more
unworthy
a
right
earl
john
you
talk
too
much
this
whippet
here
slinks
at
his
heel
you
say
mercy
may
close
her
eyes
then
take
him
off
blind
him
or
what
you
will
and
let
him
thank
his
master
for
it
but
wait
perhaps
he
knows
where
we
may
trap
this
young
patrician
thief
where
is
your
master
serf
where
you
never
find
him
john
oh
ho
the
dog
is
faithful
take
him
away
get
your
red
business
done
i
shall
require
your
men
to
ride
with
me

him
out
yonder
a
into
the
wood
so
that
his
clamour
do
not
offend
my
lord
delay
no
time
the
irons
are
hot
by
this
they
give
you
light
enough
to
blind
him
by
serf
out
and
struggling
as
he
is
forced
back
into
the
no
no
not
that
god
will
repay
you
kill
me
out
of
hand
sheriff
prince
there
is
a
kind
of
justice
in
all
this
the

heated
in
that
fire

lord
which
was
his
hut
aforetime
of

fitzwalter
no
need
to
look
so
startled
but
it
is
no
secret
here
for
many
of
you
are
sharers
of
his
wild
adventures
now
i
hoped
an
end
had
come
to
these
until
another
rumour
reached
me
this
very
day
of
yet
another
prank
you
know
you
know
how
perilous
a
road
my
marian
must
ride
if
huntingdon
tramples
the
beneath
his
heel
and
in
the
thin
disguise
of
robin
hood
succours
the
saxon
outlaws
makes
his
house
a
refuge
for
them
lavishes
his
wealth
to
feed
their
sick
and
needy
sheriff
and
two
of
his
men
appear
in
the
great
doorway
out
of
sight
of
the
sheriff
not
yet
keep
back
one
of
you
go
see
that
the
guards
are
set
he
must
not
slip
us
fitzwalter
oh
i
know
his
heart
is
gold
but
this
is
not
an
age
of
gold
and
those
who
have
must
keep
or
lose
the
power
even
to
help
themselves
no
he
must
doff
his
green
disguise
of
robin
hood
for
ever
and
wear
his
natural
coat
of
huntingdon
robin
ah
which
is
the
disguise
day
after
day
we
rise
and
put
our
social
armour
on
a
different
mask
for
every
friend
but
steel
always
to
case
our
hearts
we
are
all
so
wrapped
so
swathed
so
muffled
in
habitual
thought
that
now
i
swear
we
do
not
know
our
souls
or
bodies
from
their
but
custom
custom
the
great
god
custom
all
day
long
shovels
the
dirt
upon
us
where
we
lie
buried
alive
and
dreaming
that
we
stand
upright
and
royal
sir
i
have
great
doubts
about
this
world
doubts
if
we
have
the
right
to
sit
down
here
for
this
betrothal
feast
and
gorge
ourselves
with
plenty
when
we
know
that
for
the
scraps
and
crumbs
which
we
let
fall
and
never
miss
children
would
kiss
our
hands
and
women
weep
in
gratitude
suppose
a
man
fell
wounded
at
your
gates
you
not
pass
on
and
smile
and
leave
him
there
to
die
and
can
a
few
short
miles
of
distance
blind
you
miles
nay
a
furlong
is
enough
to
close
the
gates
of
mercy
must
we
thrust
our
hands
into
the
wounds
before
we
can
believe
oh
is
our
sight
so
thick
and
gross
we
came
we
saw
we
conquered
with
the
conqueror
we
gave
ourselves
broad
lands
and
when
our
king
desired
a
wider
hunting
ground
we
set
hundreds
of
saxon
homes
and
tossed
women
and
children
back
into
the
fire
if
they
but
wrung
their
hands
against
our
will
and
so
we
made
our
forest
and
its
leaves
were
pitiful
more
pitiful
than
man
they
gave
our
homeless
victims
the
same
refuge
and
happy
hiding
place
they
give
the
birds
and
foxes
then
we
made
our
and
he
that
dared
to
hunt
even
for
food
even
on
the
ground
where
we
had
burned
his
hut
the
ground
we
had
drenched
with
his
own
kindred
blood
poor
foolish
churl
why
we
put
out
his
eyes
with
irons
cut
off
both
his
hands
torture
him
with
such
horrors
that
christ
god
how
can
i
help
but
fight
against
it
all
ah
gossips
if
the
conqueror
had
but
burned
everything
with
four
walls
hut
castle
palace
and
turned
the
whole
wide
world
into
a
forest
drenched
us
with
may
we
might
be
happy
then
with
sweet
blue
curling
thro
the
boughs
and
just
a
pigeon
flap
to
break
the
silence
and
ferns
of
course
there
much
to
make
men
happy
well
well
the
forest
conquers
at
the
last
i
saw
a
thistle
in
the
castle
courtyard
a
purple
thistle
breaking
thro
the
pavement
yesterday
and
it
wonderful
how
soon
some
creepers
pick
these
old
grey
walls
to
pieces
these
nunneries
and
these
monasteries
now
they
do
spring
up
like
flowers
so
i
suppose
old
mother
nature
wins
the
race
at
last
fitzwalter
robin
my
heart
is
with
you
but
i
know
a
hundred
ages
will
not
change
this
earth
a
candle
in
his
gossip
suppose
the
sun
goes
out
like
this
pouf
it
stranger
things
have
happened
fitzwalter
silence
fool
so
if
you
share
your
wealth
with
all
the
world
earth
will
be
none
the
better
and
my
poor
girl
will
suffer
for
it
where
you
got
the
gold
you
have
already
lavished
on
the
poor
heaven
knows
friar
tuck
oh
by
the
mass
and
the
sweet
moon
of
sherwood
so
do
i
that
none
so
hard
a
riddle
ah
friar
tuck
we
know
we
know
under
the
hawthorn
bough
and
at
the
foot
of
rainbows
that
where
fairies
hide
their
gold
cut
me
a
silver
penny
out
of
the
moon
next
time
you
there
now
tell
me
have
you
brought
your
friar
tuck
hush
hush
oh
mum
the
word
i
see
it
fitzwalter
believe
me
robin
there
one
way
and
only
one
patience
when
comes
home
from
the
crusade
he
will
not
brook
this
blot
upon
our
chivalry
prince
john
is
dangerous
to
a
heart
like
yours
beware
of
rousing
him
meanwhile
your
troth
holds
good
but
till
the
king
comes
home
from
the
crusade
you
must
not
claim
your
bride
robin
so
be
it
then
when
the
great
king
comes
home
from
the
crusade
fitzwalter
meanwhile
for
marian
sake
and
mine
i
pray

scarlet
better
heart
there
never
beat
beneath
a
leather
jerkin
he
loved
the
forest
and
the
forest

and
if
the
lads

the
forest
livery
of

happen
to
break

as
on
my
soul
i
swear

they
shall
why
that
a
matter
none
shall
answer
for
to

or
king
or
god
but
you
and
robin
hood
and
if
the
judgment
strike
harder
upon
us
than
the
heavenly
smile
of
sunshine
thro
the
greenwood
may
it
fall
upon
my
head
alone
the
sheriff
with
two
of
his
sheriff

trespassed
against
the
officers
of
the
king
by
force
of
arms
thou
art
hereby
outlawed
and
banished

realm
robin
that
well
it
puts
an
end
to
the
great
question
of
how
i
shall
dispose
my
wealth
fitzwalter
but
banished
no
that
is
beyond
their
power
while

have
power
to
breathe

call

golden
rule

black
nun
whose
face
i
could
not
see

am
but
your
fool
your
dancing
before
the
wild
winds
of
the
future
i
feel
them
thrilling
through
my
tattered
wits
long
ere
your
wisdom
feels
them
my
poor
brain
is
like
a
harp
hung
in
a
swept
by
the
winds
of
fate
i
am
but
a
fool
but
oh
beware
of
that
nun
marian

jesting

burning
low

cries
in
the
distance

heavy
sound
of
chains

the
stream
of
moonlight

to
the
door

sherwood
forest
an
open
glade
showing
on
the
right
the
mouth
of
the
outlaw
cave
it
is
about
sunset
the
giant
figure
of
little
john
comes
out
of
the
cave
little
john
when
spring
comes
back
to
england
and
crowns
her
brows
with
may
round
the
merry
moonlit
world
she
goes
the
greenwood
way
stops
and
calls
in
stentorian
much
much
much
where
has
he
vanished
now
where
has
that
monstrous
giant
the
miller
son
hidden
himself
much
a
figure
carrying
a
large
bundle
of
much
hush
hush
child
here
i
am
and
here
our
fairy
ha
ha
come
praise
me
praise
me
for
a
thoughtful
parent
there
nothing
makes
a
better
bed
than
ferns
either
for
sleeping
sound
or
rosy
dreams
little
john
take
care
the
that
the
fairies
use
get
not
among
thy
yellow
locks
my
titan
or
wake
up
invisible
there
none
too
much
of
much
already
much
up
at
him
it
would
take
our
big
barn
full
of
i
misdoubt
to
make
thee
walk
invisible
little
john
my
sweet
tom
thumb
and
in
this
troublous
age
of
if
we
minions
we
gentlemen
of
the
moon
could
only
hunt
invisible
there
many
and
many
of
us
with
thumbs
lopped
off
eyes
gutted
and
legs
pruned
slick
like
poor
pollarded
would
be
lying
happy
and
whole
this
day
beneath
the
boughs
little
john
invisible
ay
but
what
would
jenny
say
to
such
a
ghostly
midge
as
thou
be
sipping
invisibly
at
her
cherry
lips
much
why
there
now
that
a
teaser
as
it
is
do
joke
about
it
my
poor
jenny
takes
the
smallness
of
her
much
sorely
to
heart
and
though
i
often
tell
her
half
a
loaf
ground
in
our
mill
is
better
than
no
bread
she
weeps
poor
thing
that
an
impartial
heaven
bestows
on
her
so
small
a
crumb
of
bliss
as
me
you
scarce
believe
now
half
the
nostrums
possets
and
strangely
nasty
herbal
juices
that
girl
has
made
me
gulp
in
the
vain
hope
that
i
the
frog
should
swell
to
an
ox
like
thee
i
tell
her
it
all
in
vain
and
she
still
cheats
her
fancy
and
swears
i
grown
well
nigh
three
feet
already
o
lord
she
desperate
she
advance
right
inward
to
the
sources
of
creation
she
take
the
reins
of
the
world
in
hand
she
stop
the
sun
like
joshua
turn
the
moon
to
blood
and
if
i
have
to
swallow
half
the
herbs
in
sherwood
i
shall
stalk
a
giant
yet
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
thee
little
john
and
crack
thy
head
at
but
do
do
joke
about
it
is
a
serious
matter
little
john
into
the
cave
then
with
thy
old
much
thy
father
waits
thee
there
to
make
a
table
of
green
turfs
for
robin
hood
we
shall
have
guests
anon
o
merry
times
baron
and
knight
and
abbot
all
that
ride
through
sherwood
all
shall
come
and
dine
with
him
when
they
have
paid
their
toll
old
much
is
there
growling
at
thy
delay
much
towards
the
o
my
poor
father
now
there
a
sad
thing
too
he
is
so
ashamed
of
his
descendants
why
for
some
nine
years
he
shut
his
eyes
whenever
he
looked
at
me
and
i
have
seen
him
on
the
village
green
pretend
to
a
stranger
once
who
badgered
him
with
curious
questions
that
i
was
the
son
of
poor
old
gaffer
bramble
the
lame
sexton
that
afternoon
up
comes
old
bramble
white
hair
and
big
red
waggling
nose
all
shaking
with
the
palsy
bangs
our
door
clean
off
its
hinges
with
his
crutch
and
stands
there
framed
against
the
sunset
sky
he
stretches
out
one
quivering
at
father
like
the
great
destroying
angel
in
the
stained
window
straight
the
milk
boiled
over
the
cat
ran
baby
squalled
and
mother
screeched
old
bramble
asks
my
father
what
what
what
he
meant
he
meant
he
meant
you
should
have
seen
my
father
hopeless
face
lord
how
he
blushed
red
as
a
lord
lord
how
he
blushed
is
a
hard
business
when
a
parent
looks
askance
upon
his
offspring
into
the
little
john
skip
you
chatterer
here
comes
our
master
robin
master
where
hast
thou
been

harm

to
thee

a
shaft
that

thy
coat

it
on
the
borders
of
the
wood
nicholas
my
lad
they
on
the
watch
little
john
what
didst
thou
there
they
on
the
watch
i
faith
a
squirrel
could
not
pass
them
why
my
namesake
prince
john
would
sell
his
soul
to
get
thy
head
and
both
his
ears
for
lady
marian
and
whether
his
ears
or
soul
be
worth
the
more
i
know
not
when
the
first
lark
flittered
up
to
sing
at
dawn
i
woke
and
thou
wast
gone
what
didst
thou
there
robin
well
first
i
went
to
swim
in
the
deep
pool
below
the
mill
little
john
i
swam
enough
last
night
to
last
me
many
a
day
what
then
robin
i
could
not
wash
away
the
thought
of
all
you
told
me
if
prince
john
should
dare
that
helpless
girl
no
no
i
will
not
think
it
why

went
and
tried
to
shoot
a
grey
goose

crammed
honeycomb

thousand
miles
away
this

not
moonlight
and
i
am
not
endymion
could
i
dream
my
dian
would
come
wandering
through
the
fern
before
the
sunset
even
that
rose
your
face
you
muffled
in
its
own
green
leaves
marian
but
you
were
hidden
in
the
heart
of
sherwood
robin
hidden
behind
a
million
mighty
boughs
and
yet
i
found
you
robin
ay
the
young
moon
stole
in
pity
down
to
her
poor
shepherd
boy
but
he
could
never
climb
the
fleecy
clouds
up
to
her
throne
never
could
print
one
kiss
on
her
immortal
lips
he
lay
asleep
among
the
poppies
and
the
crags
of
latmos
and
she
came
down
to
him
his
queen
stole
down
marian
oh
robin
first
a
rose
and
then
a
moon
a
rose
that
breaks
at
a
breath
and
falls
to
your
feet
the
fickle
moon
oh
hide
me
from
the
world
for
there
they
say
love
goes
by
the
same
law
let
me
be
outlawed
then
i
can
not
change
sweetheart
sweetheart
prince
john
will
hunt
me
down
prince
john
queen
elinor
will
hunt
me
down
robin
queen
elinor
nay
but
tell
me
what
this
means
how
came
you
here
marian
the
queen
she
came
last
night
made
it
an
odious
kind
of
praise
to
me
that
he
not
three
months
wedded
to
his
bride
should
pah
and
then
she
said
five
hundred
men
were
watching
round
the
borders
of
the
wood
but
she
herself
would
take
me
safely
through
them
said
that
i
should
be
safer
here
with
robin
she
had
your
name
so
pat
and
i
gave
way
queen
elinor
behind
she
conceals
herself
to
robin
marian
she
might
have
trapped
you
to
prince
john
marian
no
no
i
think
she
wanted
me
to
guide
her
here
to
your
hiding
place
she
wished
to
see
you
herself
unknown
to
john
i
know
not
why
it
was
my
only
way
her
skilful
tongue
quite
won
my
father
over
made
him
think
poor
father
clinging
to
his
lands
again
he
yet
might
save
them
and
so
without
ado
it
will
be
greatly
to
the
joy
of
much
your
funny
little
man
i
bade
my
maid
jenny
go
pack
her
small
belongings
up
this
morning
and
to
follow
with
friar
tuck
and
widow
scarlet
they
be
here
anon
robin
where
did
you
leave
the
queen
marian
robin
she
tried
to
kill
me
we
were
deep
within
the
wood
and
she
began
to
tell
me
a
wild
tale
saying
that
i
reminded
her
of
days
when
robin
was
her
page
and
how
you
came
to
court
a
breath
of
april
in
her
life
and
how
you
worshipped
her
and
how
she
grew
to
love
you
but
she
saw
you
loved
me
best
so
would
she
mix
her
gall
and
lies
with
honey
so
she
would
let
you
go
and
then
she
tried
to
turn
my
heart
against
you
bade
me
think
of
all
the
perils
of
your
outlawry
then
flamed
with
anger
when
she
found
my
heart
steadfast
and
when
i
told
her
we
drew
nigh
the
cave
she
bade
me
wait
and
let
her
come
first
here
to
speak
with
you
some
devil
trick
gleamed
in
her
smile
the
way
some
women
have
of
smiling
with
their
lips
wreathing
the
skin
in
pleasant
ripples
laughing
with
their
teeth
while
the
cold
eyes
watch
cruel
as
a
that
fascinates
a
bird
i
not
obey
her
she
whipped
a
dagger
out
had
it
not
been
for
who
dogged
us
all
the
way
poor
faithful
fool
and
leapt
out
at
her
hand
she
would
have
killed
me
then
she
darted
away
like
a
wild
thing
into
the
woods
trying
to
find
your
hiding
place
most
like
robin
o
marian
why
why
did
you
trust
her
listen

comes

great
white

as

as
the
star
that

on
bethlehem

robin
one
kiss
oh

bright
eyes
dear
heavens
of
sweeter
stars
where

face
of

into

hut

shut
robin
goes
to
the
mouth
of
the
cave
and
throws
himself
down
on
a
couch
of
deerskins
the
light
grows
dimly
rich
and
to
his
here
comes
the
little
cloud
little
moonlit
cloud
comes
floating
down
between
the

the
glade

is
seen
reposing
upon

if

would
convey
our
fairy
lore
to
mortal
ears
when
have
they
heard
our
honeysuckle
bugles
blowing
reveille
to
the
crimson
dawn
we
can
but
speak
by
dreams
and
if
you
spoke
they
whip
you
for
your
words

all
ring
false
like
sweet
bells
out
of
tune

on

of

they
grow
too
fond
of
feasting
as
i
passed
this
way
i
saw
the
fairy
halls
of
hollowed
oaks
all
lighted
with
their
pale
green
lamps
and
under
great
festoons
of
their
brilliant
mushroom
tables
groaned
with
food
hundreds
of
fairies
banqueted
all
sherwood
glittered
with
their
prismy
goblets
brimming
the
thrice
refined
and
luscious
dew
not
only
of
our
own
most
purplest
violets
but
of
strange
fragrance
wild
exotic
nectars
drawn
from
the
fairy
blossoms
of
some
star
beyond
our

beyond
that
moon
which
is
our
natural
limit
the
big
lamp

mighty

is
all
attendant
on
thy
word
oberon
great
elves
pixies
nixies
gnomes
and
leprechauns
we
are
met
this
moonlight
for
momentous
councils
concerning
those
two
drowsy
human
lovers
maid
marian
and
her
outlawed
robin
hood
they
are
in
dire
peril
yet
we
may
not
break
our
vows
of
silence
many
a
time
has
robin
hood
by
kindly
words
and
deeds
done
in
his
human
world
sent
a
new
breath
of
life
and
joy
like
spring
to
fairyland
and
at
the
of
this
very
he
saved
a
fairy
whom
he
thought
poor
soul
only
a
in
a
spider
web
he
saved
her
from
the
clutches
of
that
wizard
that
cruel
thing
that
dark
old
mystery
whom
ye
all
know
and
shrink
from
of
horror
from
the
plucked
her
forth
so
gently
that
not
one
bright
rainbow
gleam
upon
her
wings
was
clouded
not
one
flake
of
bloom
brushed
off
there
lies
the
broken
web
go
look
at
it
and
here
is
pale
perilla
to
tell
you
all
the
tale
fairies
cluster
to
look
at
the
web
a
fairy
can
we
not
make
them
free
of
fairyland
like
to
come
and
go
at
will
upon
the
wings
of
dreams
oberon
not
till
they
lose
their
wits
like
can
i
not
break
my
fairy
vows
and
tell
oberon
only
on
pain
of
what
we
fairies
call
death
death
oberon
never
to
join
our
happy
revels
never
to
pass
the
gates
of
fairyland
again
but
die
like
mortals
what
that
means
we
do
not
know
who
knows
if
i
could
save
them
i
am
only
oberon
there
is
a
king
beyond
the
seas
if
he
came
home
in
time
all
might
be
well
we
fairies
only
catch
stray
gleams
wandering
shadows
of
things
to
come
titania
oh
if
the
king
came
home
from
the
crusade
why
will
he
fight
for
graves
beyond
the
sea
oberon
our
elfin
couriers
brought
the
news
at
dusk
that
while
wandering
home
thro
europe
in
armour
like
an
errant
knight
despite
the
great
red
cross
upon
his
shield
was
captured
by
some
wicked
prince
and
thrust
into
a
dungeon
only
a
song
they
say
can
break
those
there
is
a
minstrel
that
loves
his
king
if
he
should
roam
the
world
singing
until
from
that
dark
tower
he
hears
the
king
reply
the
king
would
be
set
free
titania
only
a
song
only
a
minstrel
oberon
ay
and
blondel
is
his
name
long
low
sound
of
wailing
is
heard
in
the
distance
the
fairies
shudder
and
creep
titania
hark
what
is
that
oberon
the
cry
of
the
poor
the
cry
of
the
oppressed
the
sound
of
women
weeping
for
their
children
the
victims
of
the
forest
laws
the
moan
of
that
dark
world
where
mortals
live
and
die
sweeps
like
an
icy
wind
thro
fairyland
and
oh
it
may
grow
bitterer
yet
that
sound
was
merlin
darkest
prophecy
that
earth
should
all
be
wrapped
in
smoke
and
fire
the
woods
hewn
down
the
flowers
discoloured
and
the
sun
begrimed
until
the
rows
of
lifeless
trees
against
the
greasy
sunset
seemed
no
more
than
sooty
smudges
of
an
ogre
thumbs
upon
the
sweating
forehead
of
a
slave
while
all
night
long
fed
with
the
souls
of
men
and
bodies
too
great
forges
blast
and
burn
till
the
great
ogre
cauldrons
brim
with
gold
wailing
sound
is
heard
again
in
the
to
be
shut
out
for
ever
only
to
hear
those
cries
i
am
only
the
fool
i
can
not
face
it
is
there
no
hope
but
this
no
hope
for
robin

marian
oberon
if
the
great
king
comes
home
from
the
crusade
in
time
if
not
there
is
another
king
beyond
the
world
they
say
death
that
dark
death
to
leave
the
sunlight
and
the
flowers
for
ever
i
can
not
bear
it
oh
i
can
not
tell
them

perhaps
the
great
king

come
home
if

wandering
minstrel

now
if
you
like
and
comb
it
all
day
long
but
do
get
crabbed
and
do
speak
so
crossly
begins
loosening
marian
hair
and
combing
jenny
why
mistress
it
grows
longer
every
day
it
far
below
your
knees
and
how
it
shines
and
wavy
just
like
much
the
miller
brook
where
it
comes
tumbling
out
into
the
sun
like
gold
red
gold
marian
ah
that
provoking
jenny
for
you
forgot
to
bring
me
my
steel
glass
and
if
you
chatter
so
i
shall
soon
want
it
jenny
i
found
a
very
good
one
at
a
pinch
there
a
smooth
silver
pool
down
in
the
stream
where
you
can
see
your
face
most
beautiful
marian
so
that
how
jenny
spends
her
lonely
hours
a
sad
female
narcissus
while
poor
much
dwines
to
an
echo
jenny
i
do
like
those
gods
i
never
cared
for
them
but
as
for
much
much
is
the
best
of
all
the
merry
men
and
mistress
o
he
speaks
so
beautifully
it
be
just
an
echo
from
blue
hills
far
far
away
you
see
he
quite
a
scholar
much
more
an
most
that
what
he
calls
the
three
greasy
caparisons
much
more
an
most
you
see
they
thought
that
being
so
very
small
they
could
not
make
him
grow
to
be
a
man
they
make
a
scholar
of
him
instead
the
friar
taught
him
his
letters
he
can
write
his
name
and
mine
and
yours
just
like
a
missal
book
in
lovely
colours
and
he
always
draws
the
first
big
letter
of
jenny
like
a
tree
with
naked
cupids
hiding
in
the
branches
mistress
i
do
believe
you
hear
one
word
i
ever
speak
to
you
your
eyes
are
always
that
far
and
far
away
marian
i
listening
jenny
jenny
well
when
he
draws
the
first
big
m
of
yours
he
makes
it
like
a
bridge
from
earth
to
heaven
with
angels
passing
up
and
down
and
underneath
the
bridge
in
a
black
stream
he
puts
the
drowning
face
of
the
bad
prince
holding
his
wicked
hands
out
while
a
devil
stands
on
the
bank
and
with
a
pointed
stake
keeps
him
from
landing
ah
what
that
what
that
marian
o
jenny
how
you
startled
me
jenny
i
thought
i
saw
that
same
face
peering
thro
the
ferns
yonder
there
see
they
are
shaking
still
ah
ah
john
and
another
man
appear
advancing
across
the
john

dainty
tigress

her
den

pretty
scrap

had
time
to
tire

dark
cave

villain
into
the
cave
and

and
more
you
saved
much
more
than
my
poor
life
is
worth
but
sir
think
well
this
man
is
dangerous
not
to
me
alone
but
to
the
king
of
england
for
he
yet
usurp
the
throne
think
well
knight
i
ask
no
more
i
have
more
reasons
than
you
know
robin
so
be
it
ho
bring
the
prisoner
back
foresters
bring
prince
john
back

stares
at

this
knight
quickly
get
thee

john
goes
out
shaken
and
robin
we
think
no
more
of
him
it
is
our
rule
that
we
meet
in
merry
greenwood
should
dine
with
us
will
you
not
be
our
guest
knight
that
a
most
happy
thought
i
have
not
heard
a
merrier
word
than
dinner
all
this
day
i
am
starved
robin
will
you
not
raise
your
visor
and
let
us
know
to
whose

breaks
the
forest
laws
robin
that
is
my
name
we
hold
this
earth
as
naturally
our
own
as
the
glad
common
air
we
breathe
we
think
no
man
no
king
can
so
usurp
the
world
as
not
to
give
us
room
to
live
free
lives
but
if
you
shrink
from
eating
the
king
deer
knight

a
table
of
green
turfs
beneath
a
spreading
oak
marian

at
the
door
of

roundly
too
at
thy
delay

towards

the
hut
with
a
scarlet
mother
friar
tuck
you
see
my
sons
you
could
expect
the
lad
to
run
there
is
a
certain
looseness
in
the
limbs
a
quaking
of
the
flesh
that
overcomes
the
bravest
who
has
felt
a
hangman
rope
cuddling
his
neck
robin
you
judge
him
by
the
rope
that
cuddles
your
slim
waist

warrant
you
were
glad
to
bear
him
company

man
of
solids
like
the
church
i
am
founded

rock

robin
solids
i
faith
sir
it
is
true
he
is
partly
based
on
beef
he
grapples
with
it
squarely
but
fluids
too
have
played
their
part
in
that
cathedral
choir
he
calls
his
throat
one
godless
virtue
sir
they
seem
to
have
given
him
never
a
nightingale
gurgles
jug
jug
in
mellower
tones
than
he
when
jugs
are
flowing
never
a
thrush
can
pipe
sweet
sweet
so
rarely
as
when
a
pipe
of
wine
summers
his
throttle
we
make
him
sing
to
us
one
of
his
heathen
ditties
malmsey
or
the
merry
red
lane

first
clout

grace

our
custom

repast
is
borrowed
from
the
king
to
drain
one
cup
to
him
and
his
return
from
the
crusade
before
we
dine
that
same
friar
calls

a
cause

cries

his
return
from
the
crusade

and
resume
their
robin

drink
the
health
sir
knight
i
hope

with
knight

i
hold
with
him
you
were
too
quick
for
me
i
had
not
drawn
these
gauntlets
off
but
tell
me
lady
marian
when
is
your
bridal
day
with
robin
hood
marian
we
shall
be
wedded
when
the
king
comes
home
from
the
crusade
knight
ah
when
the
king
comes
home
that
music
all
the
birds
of
april
sing
in
those
four
words
for
me
the
king
comes
home
marian
i
am
glad
you
love
him
sir
robin
but
you
not
eating
your
helmet
locked
and
barred
will
you
not
raise
your
visor
knight
ha
ha
ha
you
see
i
am
trapped
i
did
not
wish
to
raise
it
hunger
and
thirst
break
down
all
masks
and
all
disguises
robin
rises
and
removes
his
helmet
revealing
the
face
of
richard
coeur
de
robin
the
king
all
leap
to
their
outlaws
the
king
the
king
robin
but
oh
my
liege
i
should
have
known
when
we
were
hard
beset
around
will
scarlet
by
their
swarming
bands
and
when
you
rode
out
of
the
eastern
sky
and
hurled
our
foemen
down
i
should
have
known
it
was
the
king
come
home
from
the
crusade
and
when
i
was
beset
here
in
the
wood
by
treacherous
hounds
again
i
should
have
known
whose
armour
suddenly
burned
between
the
leaves
i
should
have
known
either
it
was
george
or
else
the
king
come
home
from
the
crusade
richard
indeed
there
is
one
thing
that
might
have
told
you
robin
a
lover
instinct
since
it
seems
so
much
for
you
and
marian
depends
on
my
return
sire
you
will
pardon
me
for
i
am
only
a
fool
and
yet
methinks
you
know
not
half
the
meaning
of
those
words
the
king
the
king
comes
home
from
the
crusade
thrust
up
your
swords
heft
uppermost
my
lads
and
shout
the
king
comes
home
from
the
crusade
leaps
on
a
seat
and
thrusts
up
the
king
sword
heft
uppermost
as
if
it
were
a
robin
pardon
him
sire
poor
has
lost
his
wits
that
what
titania
said
you
say
poor
sweet
bells
out
of
tune
but
oh
do
leave
do
leave
the
forest
there
darker
things
to
come
do
leave
the
forest
i
have
wits
enough
at
least
to
wrap
my
legs
around
my
neck
for
warmth
on
winter
nights
richard
well
you
no
need
to
pass
the
winter
in
these
woods
oh
not
winter
robin
be
silent
goes
aside
and
throws
himself
down
sobbing
among
the
richard
when
even
your
cave
methinks
can
scarce
be
cheery
huntingdon
your
earldom
we
restore
to
you
this
day
you
and
my
lady
marian
shall
return

threw
aside

great
shout

and
his
bride
must
bless
the
star
of
errant
knighthood
john
he
stayed
just
long
enough
to
let
them
pass
one
fearless
honeymoon
in
the
broad
sunlight
of
his
royal
favour
then
like
a
meteor
off
goes
great
king
richard
and
leaves
them
but
the
shadow
of
his
name
to
shelter
them
from
my
revenge
they
know
it
i
have
seen
her
shiver
like
a
startled
fawn
and
draw
him
closer
damn
him
as
i
passed
elinor
they
would
have
flitted
to
the
woods
again
but
for
my
lord
fitzwalter
john
that
old
fool
has
wits
enough
to
know
i
shall
be
king
and
for
his
land
sake
cheats
himself
to
play
sir
pandarus
of
troy
is
wrong
dear
daughter
to
think
such
evil
pah
he
makes
me
sick
elinor
better
to
laugh
he
is
useful
john
if
i
were
king
if
richard
were
to
perish
i
elinor
you
be
king
the
sooner
never
fear
these
wandering
meteors
flash
into
their
graves
like
lightning
and
no
thunder
follows
them
to
warn
their
foolish
henchmen
john
at
her
shall
i
risk
the
king
return
elinor
what
do
you
mean
john
i
mean
i
can
not
wait
and
watch
this
robin
hood
dangle
the
fruit
of
tantalus
before
me
then
eat
it
in
my
sight
i
have
borne
enough
he
gave
me
like
a
fairing
to
my
brother
in
sherwood
forest
and
i
now
must
watch
him
a
happy
bridegroom
with
the
happy
bride
whose
lips
i
meant
for
mine
elinor
and
do
you
think
i
love
to
see
it
john
had
it
not
been
for
you
he
would
have
died
ere
this
elinor
then
let
him
die
john
oh
ay
but
do
you
mean
it
mother
elinor
god
i
hate
him
hate
him
john
mother
he
goes
at
noon
to
sherwood
forest
with
a
bag
of
gold
for
some
of
his
old
followers
if
by
chance
he
fall
how
saith
the
scripture
among
thieves
and
vanish
is
not
heard
of
any
more
i
think
suspicion
scarce
could
lift
her
head
among
these
roses
here
to
hiss
at
me
when
returns
elinor
vanish
john
i
would
not
kill
him
too
quickly
i
would
have
him
taken
to
a
dungeon
that
i
know
elinor
you
have
laid
your
trap
already
tell
me
you
need
not
be
afraid
i
saw
them
kiss
in
the
garden
yesternight
and
i
have
wondered
ever
since
if
fire
could
make
a
brand
quite
hot
enough
to
stamp
my
hate
upon
him
john
well
then
i
will
tell
you
the
plan
is
laid
and
if
his
bag
of
gold
rejoice
one
serf
then
i
resign
maid
marian
to
his
loving
arms
for
ever
but
you
must
help
me
mother
or
she
suspect
do
not
let
slip
your
mask
of
friendliness
as
i
have
feared
look
there
our
lovers
come
beneath
that
arch
of
roses
look
look
mother
they
are
taking
leave
of
one
another
now
a
ghastly
parting
for
he
will
be
gone
well
nigh
four
hours
they
think
to
look
at
them
one
might
suppose
they
knew
it
was
for
ever
elinor
come
or
my
hate
will
show
itself
in
my
face
i
must
not
see
them
prince
and
elinor
a
pause
enter
robin
hood
and
robin
so
once
more
sweetheart
marian
four
hours
how
shall
i
pass
the
time
four
hours
four
ages
you
will
scarce
be
home
by
dusk
how
shall
i
pass
it
robin
you
to
think
what
robe
to
wear
at
the
great
masque
and
then
to
don
it
when
you
done
all
that
i
shall
be
home
again
marian
what
not
before
robin
that
not
unlikely
either
marian
now
you
mock
me
but
you
be
back
before
the
masque
begins
robin
i
warrant
you
i
will
marian
it
is
a
month
since
we
were
married
did
you
know
it
fie
i
believe
you
had
forgotten
robin
robin
i
had
almost
if
marriage
make
the
moons
fly
as
this
month
has
flown
we
shall
be
old
and
grey
in
our
graves
before
we
know
it
i
wish
that
we
could
chain
old
father
time
marian
and
break
his
glass
into
ten
thousand
pieces
robin
and
drown
his
cruel
scythe
ten
fathom
deep
under
the
bright
blue
sea
whence
love
was
born
marian
ah
but
we
have
not
parted
all
this
month
more
than
a
garden
breadth
an
arrow
flight
time
will
be
dead
till
you
come
back
again
four
hours
of
absence
make
four
centuries
do
you
remember
how
the
song
goes
robin
that
bids
true
lovers
not
to
grieve
at
parting
often
for
nature
gently
severs
them
thus
training
them
up
with
kind
and
tender
art
for
the
great
day
when
they
must
part
for
ever
robin
do
you
believe
it
marian
marian
no
for
love
buried
beneath
the
dust
of
life
and
death
would
wait
for
centuries
of
centuries
ages
of
ages
until
god
remembered
and
through
that
perishing
face
looked
up
once
more
to
loving
face
robin
your
hope
and
mine
is
not
a
man
poor
memory
indeed
a
daily
resurrection
your
hope
and
mine
marian
and
all
the
world
at
heart
i
do
believe
it
robin
and
i
if
only
that
so
many
souls
like
yours
have
died
believing
they
should
meet
again
lovers
and
children
little
children
god
will
not
break
that
trust
i
have
found
my
heaven
again
in
you
and
though
i
stumble
still
your
small
hand
leads
me
thro
the
darkness
up
and
onward
to
the
heights
i
dared
not
see
and
dare
not
even
now
but
my
head
bows
above
your
face
i
see
them
in
your
eyes
love
point
me
onward
still
takes
her
in
his
marian
come
back
come
back
before
the
masque
begins
robin
ay
or
a
little
later
never
fear
you
not
so
easily
lose
me
marian
i
shall
count
the
minutes
robin
why
you
trembling
marian
yes
i
am
foolish
this
is
the
first
small
parting
we
have
had
but
you
be
back
ere
dusk
robin
ah
do
you
think
that
chains
of
steel
could
hold
me
sweet
from
you
with
those
two
heavenly
eyes
to
call
me
home
those
lips
to
welcome
me
marian
goes
hurriedly
out
she
looks
after
him
for
a
moment
then
suddenly
robin

matter

too
late
stands
looking
after

word

sword

and
one
resounding
thwack
applied
to
your
slim
fairyhood
green
limbs

make
it
painful

ears
is
that
to

fool
mad
and
take
to
human
wisdom

sometimes
and
laughed
until
i
cried
to
see
the
round
moon
rising
these
trees
with
that
same
foolish
face
of
heavenly
mirth
winking
at
lovers
in
the
glade
puck
lovers
ha

i
caught
a
pair
of
last
night
behind
the
ruined
chapel

me
hide
behind
this
hawthorn
bush
till
they

all
go
into
the
cave
except
scarlet
and
little
john
who

anxiously
little
john
i
have
never
known
the
time
when
robin
hood
said
i
will
surely
come
and
hath
not
been
punctual
as
yonder
evening
star
scarlet
pray
god
no
harm

fallen
him

spoil
a
forester

give
my
just
to
hear
his
jolly
bugle

the
sough
of
leaves
little
john
well
i
for
sleep
the
moon
is
not
so
bright
since
robin
left
us

thy
voice
little
john
oh
he
will
talk
with
ferns
and
flowers
and
whisper
to
the
mice
perfectly
happy

happy
since
i
lost
my
wits

that
thou
never
dost
regain
them
then
i
thank
you
kindly
sir
and
pray
that
you
may
quickly
lose
your
own
and
so
be
happy

but
if
you
lost
your
wits
you
would
not
grieve
scarlet

am
crazed

the
cave
beckons
to
puck
who
steals
out
puck
some
change
is
creeping
the
forest
i
myself
scarce
laugh
so
much
since
robin
went
away
oh
my
head
hangs
as
heavily
as
a
violet
brimmed
with
the
rain
a
cloud
a
whisper
steals
across
this
listening
wood
i
am
growing
afraid
dear
fool
i
am
thy
puck
but
i
am
growing
afraid
there
comes
an
end
to
all
our
sherwood
revels
and
i
shall
never
tease
thee
again
here
comes
the
king
hail

there
are
no
palms
here
ferns

just
as
well
oberon
our
battles
all
are
wasted
our
fairy
dreams
whereby
we
strove
to
warn
robin
and
marian
wasted
dear
robin
hood
the
lover
of
the
poor
and
kind
maid
marian
our
forest
queen
are
in
the
toils
at
last
speak
speak
oberon
prince
john
hath
trapped
and
taken
robin

not
richard
king
of
this
england
did
not
richard
tempt
robin
for
marian
sake
to
leave
the
forest
did
he
not
swear
upon
the
holy
cross
that
robin
should
be
earl
of
huntingdon
and
hold
his
lands
in
safety
oberon
only
fear
of
richard
held
the
wicked
prince
in
leash
but
richard
roamed
abroad
again
prince
john
would
murder
robin
secretly
wise
men
fight
too
much
for
these
holy
sepulchres
are
not
the
living
images
of
god
better
than
empty
graves
oberon
one
grave
is
filled
now
for
our
fairy
couriers
have
brought
tidings
that
richard
is
dead
dead
oberon

few
brief
hours
the

will
be
king
of

in
his
power
no
way

we
can
not
break
our
fairy
vows
of
silence
a
mortal
can
break
those
vows
but
only
on
pain
of
death
oberon
i
the
fool
must
break
my
vows
i
must
save
robin
hood
that
he
may
save
marian
from
worse
than
death
oberon
think
what
death
means
to
you
never
to
join
our
happy
sports
again
never
to
see
the
moonlight
streaming
through
these
ancient
oaks
again
never
to
pass
the
fairy
gates
again
we
can
not
help
it
they
will
close
like
iron
in
your
face
and
you
will
hear
our
happy
songs
within
but
you
will
lie
alone
without
dying
and
never
a
word
to
comfort
you
no
hand
to
touch
your
brow
so
be
it
i
shall
see
them
entering
in
the
time
is
brief

tell
me
where
is
robin

or
the
news
that
makes
prince
john
a
king
will
ruin
all
oberon
robin
is
even
now
thrust
in
the
great
dark
tower
beyond
the
wood
the
topmost
cell
where
foot
can
never
climb
can
not
an
arrow
reach
it
ay
be
swift
come
lead
me
thither
oberon
i
can
not
disobey
the
word
that
kills
the
seed
to
raise
the
wheat
the
word
that
i
think
i
know
now
why
great

come

oberon
and

remains
staring
after
them
then
vanishes
with
a
sob
between

trees
little
john
and
scarlet
appear
once
more
at
the
mouth
of
the
scarlet
i
thought
i
heard
a
voice
little
john
was
only
again
he
talks
for
hours
among
the
ferns
plays
with
the
flowers
and
whispers
to
the
mice
perfectly
happy
scarlet
i
can
not
rest
for
thinking
that
some
harm
hath
chanced
to
robin
call
him

gloomy

robin
bound
prince
john
and
two
mercenaries
a
low
narrow
door
in
the
background
small
barred
window
on
the
prince
john
the
leave
us
a
moment
i
have
private
matters
to
lay
before
this
friend
of
all
the
poor
you
may
begin
to
build
the
door
up
now
so
that
you
do
not
wall
me
in
with
him
two
men
begin
filling
up
the
doorway
with
rude
blocks
of
so
now
my
good
green
you
are
trapped
at
last
trapped
in
the
practice
of
your
trade
trapped
as
you
took
your
stolen
norman
gold
to
what
was
it
a
widow
or
saxon
serf
with
eye
put
out
for
breaking
forest
laws
you
hold
with
them
it
seems
your
dainty
soul
sickens
at
our
gross
penalties
and
so
we
not
inflict
them
on
your
noble
self
although
we
have
the
power
there
not
a
soul
can
ever
tell
where
robin
hood
is
gone
these
walls
will
never
echo
it
taps
the
wall
with
his
and
yet
there
surely
must
be
finer
ways
to
torture
so
fine
a
soul
as
yours
was
it
not
you
who
gave
me
like
a
fairing
to
my
brother
with
lofty
condescension
in
your
eyes
and
shall
i
call
my
mercenaries
in
and
bid
them
burn
your
eyes
out
with
hot
irons
richard
is
gone
he
never
hear
of
it
an
earl
that
plays
the
robber
disappears
that
all
most
like
he
died
in
some
low
scuffle
out
in
the
greenwood
i
am
half
inclined
to
call
for
irons
after
all
so
that
your
sympathy
with
saxon
churls
may
be
more
deep
you
understand
and
then
it
would
be
sweet
for
you
alone
and
blind
to
know
that
you
could
never
in
this
life
see
marian
face
again
but
no
that
bad
bad
art
to
put
hope
eyes
out
it
destroys
half
a
man
fear
to
rob
him
of
his
hope
no
you
shall
drink
the
dregs
of
it
hope
shall
die
more
exquisite
a
death
robin
my
friend
you
understand
that
when
i
quit
your
presence
this
bare
blank
cell
becomes
your
living
tomb
do
you
not
comprehend
it
none
so
hard
the
doorway
will
be
built
up
there
will
be
no
door
you
understand
but
just
a
wall
some
six
feet
thick
of
solid
masonry
nobody
will
disturb
you
even
to
bring
water
or
food
you
starve
see
like
a
rat
bricked
up
and
buried
but
you
have
time
to
think
of
how
i
tread
a
measure
at
the
masque
with
marian
while
her
wide
eyes
wonder
where
robin
is
and
old
fitzwalter
smiles
and
bids
his
girl
be
gracious
to
the
prince
for
his
land
sake
ah
ha
you
wince
at
that
will
you
not
speak
a
word
before
i
go
speak
damn
you
strikes
robin
across
the
face
with
his
glove
robin
remains
six
days
hence
if
you
keep
watch
at
yonder
window
you
be
hungry
then
you
may
catch
sight
of
marian
and
prince
john
wandering
into
the
gardens
down
below
you
will
be
hungry
then
perhaps
you
strive
to
call
to
us
or
stretch
a
meagre
arm
through
those
strong
bars
but
then
you
know
the
height
is
very
great
no
voice
can
reach
to
the
earth
this
is
the
topmost
cell
in
my
dark
tower
men
look
like
ants
below
there
i
shall
say
to
marian
see
that
creature
waving
there
high
up
above
us
level
with
the
clouds
is
it
not
like
a
fly
and
she
will
laugh
and
i
will
pluck
her
roses
and
then
and
then
there
are
a
hundred
ways
you
know
to
touch
a
woman
blood
with
thoughts
beyond
its
lawful
limits
ha
ha
ha
by
god
you
almost
spoke
to
me
i
think
touches
at
twilight
whispers
in
the
dark
sweet
sympathetic
murmurs
the
loss
of
her
so
thoughtless
robin
do
you
think
maid
marian
will
be
quite
so
hard
to
win
when
princes
come
to
woo
there
will
be
none
to
interrupt
us
then
time
will
be
mine
to
practise
all
the
amorous
arts
of
ovid
and
at
the
last
robin
will
you
not
free
my
hands
you
have
your
sword
but
i
would
like
to
fight
you
here
with
my
naked
hands
i
want
no
more
prince
john
ha
ha
at
last
the
sullen
speaks
that
all
i
wanted
i
have
struck
you
in
the
face
not
enough
you
ca
repay
that
blow
robin
bury
me
down
in
hell
and
i
repay
it
the
day
you
die
across
your
lying
mouth
that
spoke
of
my
true
lady
i
will
repay
it
before
the
face
of
god
prince
john
meanwhile
for
me
till
you
repay
that
blow
there
is
the
mouth
of
marian
the
sweet
mouth
that
shall
forestall
your
phantom
blow
with
balm
oh
you
go
mad
too
soon
if
i
delay
i
am
glad
you
spoke
farewell
the
masons
wait
and
i
must
not
be
late
for
marian
thro
the
small
aperture
now
left
in
the
doorway
it
is
rapidly
closed
and
sounds
of
heavy
masonry
being
piled
against
it
are
heard
robin
tries
to
free
his
hands
and
after
an
effort
succeeds
he
hurls
himself
against
the
doorway
and
finds
it
hopeless
he
turns
to
the
window
peers
through
it
for
a
moment
then
suddenly
unwinds
a
scarf
from
his
neck
ties
it
to
one
of
the
bars
and
stands
to
one
robin
too
high
a
shot
for
most
of
my
good
bowmen
what
that
a
miss
looks
thro
the
good
lad
he
try
again
stands
at
the
side
once
more
and
an
arrow
comes
thro
the
why
that
like
magic
pulls
up
the
thread
attached
to
softly
or
break
ah
now
is
sturdy
cord
i
make
it
fast
but
how
to
break
these
bars
nicholas
there
someone
climbing
he
must
have
a
head
of
iron
and
the
lightness
of
a
cat
downward
is
bad
enough
but
up
is
more
than
mortal
who
the
devil
can
it
be
thank
god
it
growing
dark
but
what
a
risk
none
of
my
merry
men
could
attempt
it
i
very
sure
it
ca
be
little
john
what
appears
at
the
god
dear
faithful
fool
i
am
glad
to
see
you
softly
gossip
softly
pull
up
the
rope
a
little
until
we
break
this
bar
away
or
some
kind
friend
may
see
the
dangling
end

crevices

crumbling
corners

very
righteous
work

great
picture
all
your
outlaws
there
sitting
around
your
throne
of
turf
and
you
judging
the
rich
and
poor
that
how

dreamed
of
it
and
you
were
taking
the
baron
gold
and
giving
it
to
the
halt
and
blind
and
then
there
was
a
great
big
light
between
the
trees
as
if
a
star
had
come
down
to
the
earth
and
caught
among
the
boughs
with
beams
like
big
soft
swords
amongst
the
ferns
and
leaves
and
through
the
light
a
mighty
steed
stepped
and
the
king
came
home
from
the
crusade
was
it
like
that
was
there
a
shining
light

been
a
blinding
light

an
arch
of
leaves

how

to

in

half
faint
on
the
way

pauses
panting
for
elinor
robin
your
heart
is
hard

looking
into

ah

insidiously
this
death
creeps

by
tightening
coil
around
a
man
when
he
is
weak
as
you
are
do
you
know
how
the
last
subtle
coil
slips
round
your
throat
and
the
flat
head
lifts
up
and
peers
with
cruel
eyes
of
cold
keen
inquisition
rivetting
your
own
until
the
blunt
mouth
sucks
your
breath
out
with
one
long
slow
poisonous
kiss

lance
for

either
pavement
blurred
the
rolling
stream
of
red
and
yellow
busses
till
the
town
turned
to
a
golden
suburb
of
the
clouds
and
round
that
mighty
bubble
of
paul
over
the
faces
of
the
street
an
slowly
sailed
with
whirring
fans
a
voyager
in
the
realms
of
gold
a
shadowy
silken
chrysalis
whence
should
break
what
radiant
wings
in
centuries
to
be
so
wandering
on
while
all
the
shores
of
time
softened
into
eternity
it
seemed
a
dead
man
touched
me
with
his
living
hand
a
flaming
legend
passed
me
in
the
streets
of
london
laugh
who
will
that
city
of
clouds
where
what
a
dreamer
yet
in
spite
of
all
is
man
that
splendid
visionary
child
who
sent
his
fairy
beacon
through
the
dusk
on
a
blue
bus
before
the
moon
was
risen
night
at
eight
the
tempest
dreaming
thus
small
wonder
that
my
footsteps
went
astray
i
found
myself
within
a
narrow
street
alone
there
was
no
rumour
near
or
far
of
the
long
tides
of
traffic
in
my
doubt
i
turned
and
knocked
upon
an
old
hard
by
an
ancient
inn
of
mullioned
panes
and
crazy
beams
and
eaves
and
as
i
knocked
the
slowly
changing
west
seemed
to
change
all
the
world
with
it
and
leave
only
that
old
inn
steadfast
and
unchanged
a
rock
in
the
tides
of
time
and
suddenly
as
a
song
that
wholly
escapes
remembrance
at
one
note
wholly
returns
there
as
i
knocked
memory
returned
to
me
i
knew
it
all
the
little
twisted
street
the
rough
wet
cobbles
gleaming
far
away
like
opals
where
it
ended
on
the
sky
and
overhead
the
darkly
smiling
face
of
that
old
wizard
inn
i
knew
by
rote
the
smooth
in
the
worn
green
paint
upon
the
doors
and
shutters
there
was
one
myself
had
idly
scratched
away
one
dawn
one
mad
three
hundred
years
ago
when
out
of
the
woods
we
came
with
hawthorn
boughs
and
found
the
doors
locked
as
they
seemed
three
hundred
years
ago
nay
time
was
dead
no
need
to
scan
the
any
more
where
that
siren
of
the
sea
curled
her
tail
among
such
rocks
as
never
in
the
merriest
seaman
tale
broke
the
of
fabulous
lagoons
beyond
the
spanish
main
and
through
the
dream
even
as
i
stood
and
listened
came
a
sound
of
clashing
then
a
song
made
the
old
timbers
of
the
mermaid
inn
shake
as
a
galleon
shakes
in
a
gale
of
wind
when
she
rolls
glorying
through
the
song
i
marchaunt
adventurers
chanting
at
the
windlass
early
in
the
morning
we
slipped
from
plymouth
sound
all
for
adventure
in
the
great
new
regions
all
for
eldorado
and
to
sail
the
world
around
sing
the
red
of
ripples
round
the

and
there
framed
in
the
lilac
patch
of
sky
that
ended
the
steep
street
dark
on
its
light
and
standing
on
those
glistering
cobblestones
just
where
they
took
the
sunset
kiss
i
saw
a
figure
like
mercury
tall
straight
and
splendid
as
a
clad
in
a
crimson
doublet
and
a
rapier
at
his
side
and
as
he
paused
his
long
fantastic
shadow
swayed
and
swept
against
my
feet
a
moment
he
looked
back
then
swaggered
down
as
if
he
owned
a
world
which
had
forgotten
did
i
wake
or
dream
even
his
gracious
ghost
over
his
arm
he
swung
a
gorgeous
cloak
of
ciprus
velvet
caked
and
smeared
with
mud
as
on
the
day
when
did
i
dream
or
wake
and
had
not
all
this
happened
once
before
when
he
had
laid
that
cloak
before
the
feet
of
gloriana
by
that
cloak
was
he
our
walter
raleigh
he
brushed
me
passing
and
with
one
vigorous
thrust
opened
the
door
and
entered
at
his
heels
i
followed
into
the
mermaid
through
three
yards
of
gloom
then
into
an
old
swimming
with
faces
in
a
mist
of
smoke
that
blue
from
long
winchester
pipes
while
like
some
rare
old
picture
in
a
dream
recalled
quietly
listening
laughing
watching
pale
on
that
old
black
oaken
wainscot
floated
one
bearded
oval
face
young
with
deep
eyes
whom
raleigh
hailed
as
will
but
as
i
stared
a
sudden
buffet
from
a
brawny
hand
made
all
my
senses
swim
and
the
room
rang
with
laughter
as
upon
the
floor
my
feet
slipped
and
i
fell
then
a
gruff
voice
growled
over
me
get
up
now
or
else
mine
host
must
find
another
drawer
hast
thou
not
heard
us
calling
all
this
while
and
as
i
scrambled
up
the
rafters
rang
with
cries
of
sack
bring
me
a
cup
of
sack
canary
sack
malmsey
and
muscadel
i
understood
and
flew
i
was
awake
a
to
these
gods
a
prentice
ganymede
to
the
mermaid
inn
there
flitting
to
and
fro
with
cups
of
wine
i
heard
them
toss
the
chrysomelan
names
from
mouth
to
mouth
lyly
and
peele
and
lodge
kit
marlowe
michael
drayton
and
the
rest
with
ben
rare
ben
ben
who
rolled
like
a
great
galleon
on
his
some
twenty
years
of
age
he
seemed
and
yet
this
young
gargantua
with
the
jaws
the
t
for
tyburn
branded
on
his
thumb
and
grim
face
was
growling
tales
to
dekker
that
would
fright
a
how
in
the
fierce
low
countries
he
had
killed
his
man
and
won
that
scar
on
his
bronzed
fist
was
taken
prisoner
and
turned
catholick
and
now
returned
to
london
was
resolved
to
blast
away
the
vapours
of
the
town
with
plays
of
thunderous
mirth
i
thwack
their
lad
their
envies
and
lean
at
the
or
or
else
failing
these
i
find
some
good
square
with
wide
galleries
and
windows
level
with
the
stage
serve
my
comedy
of
vapours
though
i
grant
for
tragedy
a
private
house
is
best
or
just
as
burbage
to
a
deed
of
blood
or
over
your
stable

marked
in

within
some
humorous

the
pit
splits
its

over
goes
the

the

is
all

never

we
build
the
perfect
stage
in
shoreditch
yet
and
will
there
hath
half
promised
i
shall
write
a
piece
for
his
own
company
what
d
think
of
and
his
first
heir
printed
last
week
a
bouncing
boy
my
lad
and
he
at
work
on
a
midsummer
dream
that
turns
the
world
to
fairyland
all
these
and
many
more
were
there
and
all
were
young
there
as
i
brimmed
their
cups
i
heard
the
voice
of
raleigh
ringing
across
the
room
ben
could
you
put
a
frigate
on
the
stage
i
found
a
tragedy
for
you
have
you
heard
the
true
tale
of
sir
humphrey
gilbert
no
why
ben
of
all
the
tragical
affairs
of
the
and
of
that
other
ocean
where
all
men
sail
so
blindly
and
misjudge
their
friends
their
charts
their
storms
their
stars
their
god
if
there
be
truth
in
the
blind
crowder
song
i
bought
in
bread
street
for
a
penny
this
is
the
brief
type
and
chronicle
of
them
all
listen
then
raleigh
sent
these
rugged
rhymes
of
some
blind
crowder
rolling
in
great
waves
of
passion
across
the
gloom
at
each
refrain
he
sank
his
voice
to
a
broad
deep
undertone
as
if
the
distant
roar
of
breaking
surf
or
the
low
thunder
of
eternal
tides
filled
up
the
pauses
of
the
nearer
storm
storm
against
storm
a
soul
against
the
sea
a
knight
of
the
sir
humphrey
gilbert
hard
of
hand
of
the
gazed
from
the
rocks
of
his
new
found
land
and
thought
of
the
home
where
his
heart
would
be
he
gazed
across
the
wintry
waste
that
weltered
and
hissed
like
molten
lead
he
saileth
twice
who
saileth
in
haste
i
wait
the
favour
of
spring
he
said
the
more
ever
the
more
he
heard
the
winds
and
the
waves
roar
thunder
on
thunder
shook
the
the
yellow
clots
of
foam
went
by
like
shavings
that
curl
from
a
plane
clinging
and
flying
afar
and
nigh
shuddering
flying
and
clinging
again
a
thousand
bubbles
in
every
one
shifted
and
shimmered
with
rainbow
gleams
but
had
they
been
planets
and
stars
that
spun
he
had
let
them
drift
by
his
feet
like
dreams
heavy
of
heart
was
our
admirall
for
out
of
his
ships
and
they
were
but
three
he
had
lost
the
fairest
and
most
tall
and
he
was
a
knight
of
the
the
more
ever
the
more
he
heard
the
winds
and
the
waves
roar
thunder
on
thunder
shook
the
heavy
of
heart
heavy
of
heart
for
she
was
a
galleon
mighty
as
may
and
the
storm
that
ripped
her
glory
apart
had
stripped
his
soul
for
the
winter
way
and
he
was
aware
of
a
whisper
blown
from
to
poop
from
windward
to
lee
that
the
fault
was
his
and
his
alone
and
he
was
a
knight
of
the
had
he
done
that
had
he
done
this
and
yet
his
mariners
loved
him
well
but
an
idle
word
is
hard
to
miss
and
the
foam
hides
more
than
the
deep
can
tell
and
the
deep
had
buried
his
books
with
many
a
chart
and
plan
and
a
king
that
is
conquered
must
see
strange
looks
so
bitter
a
thing
is
the
heart
of
man
and
who
will
you
find
to
pay
your
debt
for
a
venture
like
this
is
a
costly
thing
will
they
stake
yet
more
tho
your
heart
be
set
on
the
mightier
voyage
you
planned
for
the
spring
he
raised
his
head
like
a
viking
crowned
i
take
my
old
flag
to
her
majestie
and
she
will
lend
me
ten
thousand
pound
to
make
her
queen
of
the
the
more
ever
the
more
he
heard
the
winds
and
the
waves
roar
thunder
on
thunder
shook
the
outside
they
heard
the
great
winds
blow
outside
the
blustering
surf
they
heard
and
the
bravest
there
would
ha
blenched
to
know
that
they
must
be
taken
at
their
own
word
for
the
great
grim
waves
were
as
molten
lead
and
he
had
two
ships
who
sailed
with
three
and
i
sail
not
home
till
the
spring
he
said
they
are
all
too
frail
for
the
but
the
trumpeter
thought
of
an
bench
and
the
longed
for
a
devonshire
lane
and
the
gunner
remembered
a
wench
and
the
whisper
went
round
again
sir
humphrey
gilbert
is
hard
of
hand
but
his
courage
went
down
with
the
ship
and
we
wait
for
the
spring
in
a
desert
land
for
is
afraid
of
the
the
more
ever
the
more
he
heard
the
winds
and
the
waves
roar
thunder
on
thunder
shook
the
he
knew
he
knew
how
the
whisper
went
he
knew
he
must
master
it
last
or
first
he
knew
not
how
much
or
how
little
it
meant
but
his
heart
was
heavy
and
like
to
burst
up
with
your
sails
my
all
the
wind
has
veered
and
my
ships
quoth
he
they
will
serve
for
a
british
admirall
who
is
of
the
his
will
was
like
a
wind
that
swept
along
our
helmless
crew
but
he
would
not
stay
on
the
for
that
was
the
stronger
ship
of
the
two
my
little
lads
hath
passed
perils
and
storms
with
me
would
ye
have
me
forsake
them
at
the
last
they
need
a
knight
of
the
the
more
ever
the
more
we
heard
the
winds
and
the
waves
roar
thunder
on
thunder
shook
the
beyond
cape
race
the
pale
sun
splashed
the
grim
grey
waves
with
silver
light
where
ever
in
front
his
frigate
crashed
eastward
for
england
and
the
night
and
still
as
the
dark
began
to
fall
ever
in
front
of
us
running
free
we
saw
the
sails
of
our
admirall
leading
us
home
through
the
the
more
ever
the
more
we
heard
the
winds
and
the
waves
roar
but
he
sailed
on
sailed
on
on
monday
at
noon
of
the
third
fierce
day
our
he
came
with
a
trail
of
blood
marking
his
way
on
the
salt
wet
decks
as
he
walked
for
a
rusty
nail
thro
his
foot
had
pierced
come
mend
it
for
me
though
i
would
it
were
changed
for
the
nails
that
amerced
the
dying
thief
upon
calvary
the
surgeon
bathed
and
bound
his
foot
and
the
master
entreated
him
sore
to
stay
but
roughly
he
pulled
on
his
great
with
the
wind
is
rising
and
i
must
away
i
know
not
why
so
little
a
thing
when
into
his
pinnace
we
helped
him
down
should
make
our
eyelids
prick
and
sting
as
the
salt
spray
were
into
them
blown
but
he
called
as
he
went
keep
watch
and
steer
by
my
lanthorn
at
night
then
he
waved
his
hand
with
a
kinglier
we
are
as
near
to
heaven
my
lads
by
sea
as
by
land
the
more
ever
the
more
we
heard
the
gathering
tempest
roar
but
he
sailed
on
sailed
on
three
hundred
leagues
on
our
homeward
road
we
strove
to
signal
him
swooping
nigh
that
he
would
ease
his
decks
of
their
load
of
nettings
and
fights
and
artillery
and
dark
and
dark
that
night
fall
and
high
the
muttering
breakers
swelled
till
that
strange
fire
which
seamen
call
castor
and
pollux
we
beheld
an
evil
sign
of
peril
and
death
burning
pale
on
the
high
but
calm
with
the
might
of
gennesareth
our
admirall
voice
went
ringing
past
clear
thro
the
thunders
far
and
clear
mighty
to
counsel
clear
to
command
joyfully
ringing
we
are
as
near
to
heaven
my
lads
by
sea
as
by
land
the
more
ever
the
more
we
heard
the
rising
hurricane
roar
but
he
sailed
on
sailed
on
and
over
us
fled
the
fleet
of
the
stars
and
ever
in
front
of
us
far
or
nigh
the
lanthorn
on
his
spars
dipped
to
the
pit
or
soared
to
the
sky
sweep
to
the
lights
of
charles
wain
as
the
hills
of
the
deep
mount
and
flee
then
swoop
down
vanishing
cliffs
again
to
the
thundering
gulfs
of
the
we
saw
it
shine
as
it
swooped
from
the
height
with
ruining
breakers
on
every
hand
then
a
cry
came
out
of
the
black
near
to
heaven
by
sea
as
by
land
and
the
light
was
out
like
a
spark
all
in
a
moment
and
we
and
we
prayed
for
his
soul
as
we
swept
thro
the
dark
for
he
was
a
knight
of
the
our
fleets
for
evermore
the
winds
triumph
and
the
waves
roar
but
he
sails
on
sails
on
before
silence
a
moment
held
the
mermaid
inn
then
michael
drayton
raising
a
cup
of
wine
stood
up
and
said
since
many
have
obtained
absolute
glory
that
have
done
great
deeds
but
fortune
is
not
in
the
power
of
man
so
they
that
truly
attempting
nobly
fail
deserve
great
honour
of
the
such
glory
did
the
greeks
and
romans
give
to
those
that
in
great
enterprises
fell
seeking
the
true
commodity
of
their
country
and
profit
to
all
mankind
for
though
they
failed
being
by
war
death
or
some
other
chance
hindered
their
images

more
admirable

what
in

full
the

all
the

worth
again
his
eyelid
dropt
at
the
apostle
paul

he
was
a
most
timorous
fellow
in

prostrate
ourselves
to
worldly
magistrates
against
our
conscience
i
shall
fry
for
this
i
fear
no
bugbears

would
have
all

of
earthly
ministers
tho
their

be
stuffed
with
curses
or
with
crusts
of

one
thing
i
will
confess

choose
give
me
the
papists

serve
their

partake
a

pay
the
reckoning

puritan
will
swallow

there
unseen
by

a
quiet
figure
entered
the

beckoning
me
for

seated
himself
to
listen

read
aloud
with
knitted
brows

ben
i
tell
thee

the
dwarfs
that
find
no

themselves
can
in

tavern
find
room
wide
enough
to
swallow
the
wide
heaven
with
all
its
crowded
solitary
stars
why
then
the

inn
should
swallow

the
voice
of
shakespeare
quietly
broke
in
as
laying
a
hand
on
either
shoulder
of
kit
he
stood
behind
him
in
the
gloom
and
smiled
across
the
table
at
ben
whose
eyes
still
blazed
with
boyhood
generous
wrath
rob
was
a
poet
and
had
i
known
no

i
am
sorry
he
thought
i
wronged
him
his
heart
blood
beats
in
this
look
where
he
says
he
dies
forsaken
kit
died
drunk
more
like
growled
ben
and
if
he
did
will
answered
none
was
there
to
help
him
home
had
not
a
poor
old
cobbler
chanced
upon
him
dying
in
the
streets
and
taken
him
to
his
house
and
let
him
break
his
heart
on
his
own
bed
read
his
last
words
you
know
he
left
his
wife
and
played
the
moth
at
tavern
tapers
burnt
his
wings
and
dropt
into
the
mud
read
here
his
dying
words
to
his

call
thus
on
their
poor
dead
youth
this
withered
shadow
that
once
was
robin

he
left
a
child

in
its
face
he
prays
her
not
to
find
the
father
but
her
own
is
yet
green
and
may
grow
so
flickers
his
last
jest

out
for
ever
at
the
last

begged
a

in
the
bill
all
printed
now
for
crows
and
daws

you
find
four
shillings
for
his

he
had
the

heart
and
god
help
all
who
have
that
heart
and
somehow

their

all
that

have
it
from

snuffled
that
the
death
of

was
caused
by
a
surfeit

whispered
laughing
i
a
prettier
plan

for

scrap
of

quietly
resumed
why
which
of
us
could
send
his
heart
and
soul
thro
caxton
and
hope
to
find
the
pretty
pair
unmangled

kit
marlowe
too
greeting
from
your
your
broken
sapling
robert
greene
read
my
letter
is
my
last
then
let
memory
blot
me
out
i
would
not
make
my
maudlin
past
a
trough
for
every
swinish
snout
first
i
leave
a
debt
unpaid
it
all
chalked
up
not
much
all
told
for
bread
and
sack
when
i
am
cold
doll
can
pawn
my
spanish
blade
and
pay
mine
host
she
pay
but
i
have
chalked
up
other
scores
in
your
own
hearts
behind
the
doors
not
to
be
paid
so
quickly
yet
o
if
you
would
not
have
my
ghost
creeping
in
at
dead
of
night
out
of
the
cold
wind
out
of
the
wet
with
weeping
face
and
helpless
fingers
trying
to
wipe
the
marks
away
read
what
i
can
write
still
write
while
this
life
within
them
lingers
let
me
pay
lads
let
me
pay
for
a
peacock
phrase
flung
out
in
a
sudden
blaze
flung
out
at
his
friend
by
this
ragged
this
poor
jackdaw
robert
greene
will
i
knew
it
all
the
while
and
you
know
it
and
you
smile
my
quill
was
but
a
jackdaw
feather
while
the
quill
that
ben
there
wields
fluttered
down
thro
azure
fields
from
an
eagle
in
the
sun
and
yours
will
yours
no
thing
a
plume
of
grain
dropt
out
of
an
angel
wing
only
a
jackdaw
feather
mine
and
mine
ran
ink
and
ben
ran
wine
and
yours
the
pure
pierian
streams
but
i
had
dreams
o
i
had
dreams
dreams
you
understand
me
will
and
i
fretted
at
the
tether
that
bound
me
to
the
lowly
plain
gnawed
my
heart
out
for
i
knew
once
tho
that
was
long
ago
i
might
have
risen
with
ben
and
you
somewhere
near
that
holy
hill
whence
the
living
rivers
flow
let
it
pass
i
did
not
know
one
bitter
phrase
could
ever
fly
so
far
through
that
immortal
sky
seeing
all
my
songs
had
flown
so
low
one
envious
phrase
that
can
not
die
from
century
to
century
kit
marlowe
ceased
a
moment
and
the
wind
as
if
indeed
the
night
were
all
one
ghost
wailed
round
the
mermaid
inn
then
sent
once
more
its
desolate
passion
through
the
reader
voice
some
truth
there
was
in
what
i
said
kit
marlowe
taught
you
half
your
trade
and
something
of
the
rest
you
learned
from
me
but
all
you
took
you
earned
you
took
the
best
i
had
to
give
you
took
my
clay
and
made
it
live
and
that
why
that
what
god
must
do
my
music
made
for
mortal
ears
you
flung
to
all
the
listening
spheres
you
took
my
dreams
and
made
them
true
and
if
i
claimed
them
the
blank
air
might
claim
the
breath
i
shape
to
prayer
i
do
not
claim
it
let
the
earth
claim
the
thrones
she
brings
to
birth
let
the
first
shapers
of
our
tongue
claim
is
said
or
sung
till
the
doom
repeal
that
debt
and
cancel
the
first
alphabet
yet
when
like
a
god
you
scaled
the
shining
crags
where
my
foot
failed
when
i
saw
my
fruit
of
the
vine
foam
in
the
olympian
cup
or
in
that
broader
chalice
shine
a
sacramental
drink
with
stars
for
bubbles
lifted
up
through
the
universal
night
up
to
the
celestial
brink
up
to
that
quintessential
light
where
god
acclaimed
you
for
the
wine
crushed
from
those
poor
grapes
of
mine
o
you
understand
no
doubt
how
the
poor
fell
how
a
can
let
out
all
the
bannered
hosts
of
hell
nay
a
the
sharp
truth
i
had
spilt
my
wine
of
youth
the
temple
was
not
mine
to
build
my
place
in
the
world
march
was
filled
yet
through
all
the
years
to
come
men
to
whom
my
songs
are
dumb
will
remember
them
and
me
for
that
one
cry
of
jealousy
that
curse
where
i
had
come
to
bless
that
harsh
voice
of
unhappiness
they
note
the
curse
but
not
the
pang
not
the
torment
whence
it
sprang
they
note
the
blow
at
my
friend
back
but
not
the
soul
stretched
on
the
rack
they
note
the
weak
convulsive
sting
not
the
crushed
body
and
broken
wing
for
my
thirty
years
dashed
with
sun
and
splashed
with
tears
wan
with
revel
red
with
wine
this
life
of
mine
other
wiser
happier
men
take
the
full
climb
slow
and
seek
the
sun
dancing
down
is
soon
done
golden
boys
beware
beware
the
ambiguous
oracles
declare
loving
gods
for
those
that
die
young
as
old
men
may
but
i
quick
as
was
my
pilgrimage
wither
in
mine
april
age
one
groatsworth
of
wit
bought
at
an
exceeding
price
ay
a
million
of
repentance
let
me
pay
the
whole
of
it
lying
here
these
deadly
nights
lads
for
me
the
mermaid
lights
gleam
as
for
a
castaway
swept
along
a
midnight
sea
the
each
a
spark
a
in
the
solid
dark
that
lets
trickle
through
a
ray
glorious
out
of
paradise
to
stab
him
with
new
agony
let
me
pay
lads
let
me
pay
let
the
mermaid
pass
the
sentence
i
am
pleading
guilty
now
a
dead
leaf
on
the
and
the
storm
whirls
me
away
kit
marlowe
ceased
but
not
the
wailing
wind
that
round
and
round
the
silent
mermaid
inn
wandered
with
helpless
fingers
trying
the
doors
like
a
most
desolate
ghost
a
sudden
throng
of
players
bustled
in
shaking
the
rain
from
their
plumed
hats
veracious
witnesses
the
snuffle
of
bame
arose
anew
declare
it
was
a
surfeit
killed
him
rhenish
wine
and
pickled
herrings
his
shirt
was
very
foul
he
had
but
one
his
doublet
too
was
frayed
and
his
boots
broken
what
gonzago
you
a
short
fat
player
called
in
a
deep
voice
across
the
room
and
throwing
aside
his
cloak
to
show
the
woman
robe
he
wore
beneath
minced
up
to
bame
and
bellowed
is
such
men
as
you
that
tempt
us
women
to
our
fall
and
all
the
throng
of
players
rocked
and
roared
till
at
a
nod
and
wink
from
kit
a
hush
held
them
again
look
to
the
door
he
said
is
any
listening
the
young
player
crept
a
mask
of
mystery
to
the
door
and
peeped
all
well
the
coast
is
clear
then
shall
we
tell
our
plan
to
master
bame
round
the
hushed
room
went
kit
a
pen
and
paper
in
his
hand
whispering
each
to
read
digest
and
sign
while
ben
the
glass
of
master
bame
and
now
said
kit
aloud
what
think
you
lads
shall
he
be
told
solemnly
one
or
two
shake
their
heads
with
safety
safety
kit
o
bame
can
keep
a
secret
come
we
tell
him
he
can
advise
us
how
a
righteous
man
should
act
we
let
him
share
an
he
approve
now
master
bame
come
closer
my
good
friend
ben
jonson
here
hath
lately
found
a
way
of
hush
come
closer
coining
money
bame
coining
ay
hush
now
hearken
a
certain
sure
and
indiscoverable
method
sir
he
is
acquainted
with
one
poole
a
felon
lately
released
from
newgate
hath
great
skill
in
mixture
of
metals
hush
and
by
the
help
of
a
right
cunning
maker
of
stamps
we
mean
to
coin
french
crowns
pistolettes
angels
and
english
shillings
for
one
breath
bame
stared
at
him
with
bulging
then
murmured
shyly
as
a
country
maid
in
her
first
wooing
not
against
the
law
why
sir
who
makes
the
law
why
should
not
bame
coin
his
own
crowns
like
queen
elizabeth
she
is
but
mortal
and
consider
too
the
good
works
it
should
prosper
in
your
hands
without
regard
to
pies
and
wine
white
as
the
milky
way
such
secrets
bame
were
not
good
for
the
general
but
a
few
discreet
and
righteous
palms
your
own
my
friend
and
mine
what
think
you
with
a
hesitant
glance
of
cunning
screwing
his
eyes
bame
laughed
a
little
huskily
and
looked
round
at
that
grave
ring
of
anxious
faces
all
holding
their
breath
and
thrilling
his
blunt
nerves
with
their
and
no
risk
breathed
bame
no
risk
at
all
o
sir
no
risk
at
all
we
make
the
very
coins
besides
that
part
touches
not
you
yours
is
the
honest
face
that
all
we
want
why
sir
if
you
be
sure
there
is
no
risk
you
help
to
spend
it
good
we
talk
anon
of
this
and
you
shall
carry
more
angels
in
your
pocket
master
bame
than
you
meet
in
heaven
set
hand
on
seal
to
this
now
master
bame
to
prove
your
faith
come
all
have
signed
it
here
the
quill
dip
write
good
and
kit
pocketing
the
paper
bowed
the
gull
to
the
saying
as
he
went
you
shall
hear
further
when
the
plan
complete
but
there
one
great
condition
not
one
word
one
breath
of
scandal
more
on
robert
greene
he
dead
but
he
was
one
of
us
the
day
you
air
his
shirt
i
air
this
paper
too
no
gleam
of
understanding
even
then
illumed
that
long
white
face
no
stage
indeed
has
known
such
acting
as
the
mermaid
inn
that
night
and
bame
but
sniggered
why
of
course
there
good
in
all
men
and
the
best
of
us
will
make
mistakes
but
no
mistakes
in
this
said
kit
or
all
together
we
shall
swing
at
tyburn
who
knows
what
may
leap
to
light
you
understand
no
scandal
not
a
breath
so
in
dead
silence
master
richard
bame
went
out
into
the
darkness
and
the
night
to
ask
as
i
have
heard
for
many
a
moon
the
price
of
and
silken
hose
and
doublets
slashed
with
satin
as
the
door
slammed
on
his
back
the
laughter
burst
with
echo
and
round
the
room
but
ceased
as
will
tossed
on
the
glowing
hearth
the
last
poor
testament
of
robert
greene
all
watched
it
burn
the
black
wind
wailed
and
moaned
around
the
mermaid
as
the
sparks
flew
up
god
what
a
night
for
ships
upon
the
sea
said
raleigh
peering
through
the
wet
black
panes
well
we
may
thank
him
for
the
little
red
ring

kit

on
the
old
black
settle

thumping
chorus

called
and
sang
this
brave
song
of
the
mermaid
inn
i

an
old
black
settle

ruins

iii
black
bill
the
garlands
of
a
whitsun
ale
were
strewn
about
our
rushes
the
night
that
raleigh
brought
bacon
to
sup
with
us
there
on
that
night
i
saw
the
singer
of
the
quietly
spreading
out
his
latest
cantos
for
shakespeare
eye
like
white
sheets
in
the
sun
marlowe
our
and
michael
drayton
talked
in
that
and
ben
was
there
humming
a
song
upon
that
old
black
settle
or
leave
a
kiss
but
in
the
cup
and
i
not
ask
for
wine
but
meanwhile
he
drank
malmsey
francis
bacon
straddled
before
the
fire
and
all
at
once
he
said
to
shakespeare
in
a
voice
that
gripped
the
mermaid
tavern
like
an
arctic
frost
are
no
poets
in
this
age
of
ours
not
to
compare
with
plautus
they
are
all
dead
the
men
that
were
famous
in
old
why
so
they
are
said
will
the
humming
stopped
i
saw
poor
spenser
a
shy
gentle
soul
with
haunted
eyes
like
starlit
forest
pools
smuggling
his
cantos
under
his
cloak
again
there
verse
enough
no
doubt
bacon
went
on
but
english
is
no
language
for
the
muse
whom
would
you
call
our
best
there
gabriel
harvey
and
edward
earl
of
oxford
then
there
dyer
and
doctor
golding
while
for
tragedy
thomas
lord
buckhurst
hath
a
lofty
vein
and
in
a
lighter
prettier
vein
why
will
there
is
but
where
euripides
dead
echoed
ben
in
a
deep
voice
and
drip
drip
drip
outside
we
heard
the
rain
miserably
dropping
round
the
mermaid
inn
thy
summer
night
eh
will
midsummer
night
that
a
quaint
fancy
bacon
droned
anew
but
athens
was
an
error
will
not
athens
titania
knew
not
athens
those
wild
elves
of
thy
midsummer
dream
eh
midnight

all
thy

too
smack
of

they
never
grew

bottom
too
he

with
a
chuckle

a
greek
why
no

was
the

of

hacket
the
fat

a
joy
in
jumping
time
and
space
but
as
he
took
the
cup
of
sack
i
proffered
solemnly
the
lawyer
shook
his
head
will
couldst
thou
use
thy
talents
with
discretion
and
obey
classic
examples
those
mightst
match
old
plautus
in
all
except
priority
of
the
tongue
this
english
tongue
is
only
for
an
age
but
latin
for
all
time
so
i
propose
to
embalm
in
latin
my
philosophies

our

in

now
let
kit
marlowe
mark
our
bill
was
an
atheist
still
except
sometimes
in
the
dark
all
we
adventured
for
who
shall
say
nor
yet
what
our
port
might
be
a
magical
city
of
old
cathay
or
a
castle
of
muscovy
with
our
atheist
bill
black
bill
under
the
swinging
bear
whistling
at
night
for
a
seaman
to
light
his
little
there
on
the
deep
in
the
night
for
a
seaman
to
light
his
little
lost
lanthorns
there
but
as
over
the
we
swept
we
chanced
on
a
strange
new
land
where
a
valley
of
tall
white
lilies
slept
with
a
forest
on
either
hand
a
valley
of
white
in
a
purple
wood
and
behind
it
faint
and
far
breathless
and
bright
the
last
rich
height
floated
the
fair
and
bright
the
height
venus
the
was
a
marvel
to
see
as
we
beached
our
boat
black
bill
in
that
air
with
the
great
white
lilies
that
reached
to
his
throat
like
a
there
and
our
little
ship
chaplain
puffing
and
red
as
we
onward
stole
with
the
disk
of
a
lily
behind
his
head
like
a
cherubin
aureole
he
was
round
and
red
and
behind
his
head
he
a
cherubin
aureole
hyrcania
land
of
honey
and
bees
we
have
found
thee
at
last
he
said
where
the
swells
in
the
hollow
trees
o
the
lily
behind
his
head
the
swells
in
the
purple
wood
is
the
swette
which
the
heavens
distil
saith
pliny
himself
on
my
little
is
the
world
not
sweet
to
thee
bill
saith
pliny
himself
on
my
little
is
the
world
not
sweet
to
thee
bill
now
a
man
may
taste
of
the
devil
hot
spice
and
yet
if
his
mind
run
back
to
the
honey
of
childhood
paradise
his
heart
is
not
wholly
black
and
bill
black
bill
from
the
days
of
his
youth
tho
his
chest
was
broad
as
an
oak
had
cherished
one
innocent
little
sweet
tooth
and
it
itched
as
our
chaplain
spoke
he
had
kept
one
perilous
little
tooth
and
it
itched
as
our
chaplain
spoke
all
around
was
a
mutter
of
bees
and
bill
muttering
too
if
the
swells
in
the
hollow
trees
what
else
can
a
didymus
do
i
steer
to
the
purple
woods
myself
and
see
if
this
thing
be
so
which
the
chaplain
found
on
his
little
for
pliny
lived
long
ago
there
a
platter
of
delf
on
his
little
and
pliny
lived
long
ago
scarce
had
he
spoken
when
out
of
the
wood
and
buffeting
all
around
rooting
our
where
we
stood
there
rumbled
a
marvellous
sound
as
a
mountain
of
honey
were
crumbling
asunder
or
a
hurled
boulders
of
golden
thunder
to
smother
the
old
black
world
boulders
of
musical
thunder
to
mellow
this
old
black
world
and
the
chaplain
he
whispered
this
honey
one
saith
on
my
camphired
none
may
harvest
on
pain
of
death
for
the
bee
would
eat
it
himself
none
walketh
those
woods
but
him
whose
voice
in
the
dingles
you
then
did
hear
a
voice
growls
bill
ay
bill
was
the
great
hyrcanian
bear
give
thanks
was
the
voice
of
the
great
hyrcanian
bear
but
marking
that
bill
looked
bitter
indeed
for
his
sweet
tooth
hungered
sore
consider
he
saith
that
the
sweet
hath
need
of
the
sour
as
the
sea
of
the
shore
as
the
night
to
the
day
is
our
grief
to
our
joy
and
each
for
its
brother
prepares
a
banquet
bill
that
would
otherwise
cloy
thus
is
it
with
honey
and
bears
roses
and
honey
and
laughter
would
cloy
give
us
thorns
too
and
sorrow
and
bears
consider
he
saith
how
by
fretting
a
string
the
lutanist
maketh
sweet
moan
and
a
bird
ere
it
fly
must
have
air
for
its
wing
to
buffet
or
fall
like
a
stone
tho
you
blacken
like
pluto
you
make
but
more
white
these
blooms
which
not
enna
could
yield
consider
black
bill
ere
the
coming
of
night
the
lilies
he
saith
of
the
field
consider
black
bill
in
this
beautiful
light
the
lilies
he
saith
of
the
field
consider
the
claws
of
a
bear
said
bill
that
can
rip
off
the
flesh
from
your
bones
while
his
belly
could
cabin
the

his

with
a
piece
of
an

velvety
nose
and
his
sensitive
eye
with
a
piece
of
an
black
bill
at
the
word
of
that
golden
crust
for
his
ears
had
forgotten
the
roar
and
his
eyes
grew
soft
with
their
innocent

bound
like

and
printed
as
fair
with

blue

is
a

for
what
honey
could
comfort
a
bear
till
the
bear
win

honey
he
said
ay
the
first
honey
wherewith
the
first

first
larded
his
nose
he
said
thou

our

quizzingly
cried

nay
answered
bill
but
i
quest
for

and
i
find
it
not

i
will
face
your
hyrcanian
bear
forsooth
and
look
at
his
nose
myself
for
truth
for

or
a
little
sweet

i
will
into
the
woods
myself
thro
that
ocean
of
bloom
with
its
wonderful
spokes
of
gold
our
crew
in
the
gloom
like
buccaneer
galleons
rolled
in
the
lilies
we
stood
and
before
we
could
say
out
of
the
valley
and
into
the
wood
he
plunged
thro
the
last
rich
light
out
of
the
lilies
and
into
the
wood
where
the
great
bear
walks
all
night
and
our
little
ship
chaplain
he
piped
thro
the
trees
as
the
moon
rose
white
and
still
hylas
return
to
thy
heracles
and
we
helped
him
with

piped
it
thrice
we
halloo
and
thrice
we
were
dumb
to
hark
but
never
an

came
from
the
wood
so
we
turned
to

there
could
sing
of

and
his

so
merry
a
jest
so
jolly
a
thing
as
this
my
tale
of
bill
is
into
the
woods
where
bill
is
now
starts
he
as
a
white
owl
hoots
and
now
he
stumbles
over
roots
and
now
beneath
his
big
in
yon
deep
glade
he
crunches
black
cakes
of
that
were
so
perchance
last
year
but
neither
now
nor
bear
at
that
dark
banquet
munches
onward
still
he
crunches
black
cakes
of
he
sees
above
him
in
the
forks
of
trees
filled
by
stars
instead
of
bees
with
brimming
silver
glisten
but
ah
such
food
of
gnome
and
fay
could
neither
bear
nor
bill
delay
till
where
yon
ferns
and
moonbeams
play
he
starts
and
stands
to
listen
what
melody
doth
he
listen
is
it
the
as
it
comes
through
the
wood
and
softly
thrums
silvery
tabors
purple
drums
to
speed
some
revel
nay
didymus
what
faint
sweet
din
of
viol
and
flute
and
violin
makes
all
the
forest
round
thee
spin
the
or
the
devil
no
doubt
at
all
the
devil
he
stares
with
naked
knife
in
hand
this
buccaneer
in
fairyland
dancing
in
a
saraband
the
red
ferns
reel
about
him
dancing
in
a
the
green
ferns
curtsey
kiss
and
cling
their
marians
flirt
their
robins
fling
their
feathery
heels
to
flout
him
the
whole

reels
about
him
dance
ye
shadows
the
glade
bill
the
undismayed
with
glittering
blade
drake
was
never
bolder
devil
or
spaniard
what
cares
he
whence
your
eerie
music
be
till
lo
against
yon
old
he
leans
his
brawny
shoulder
he
lists
and
leans
his
shoulder
ah
what
melody
doth
he
hear
as
to
that
gnarled
old
there
he
lays
his
ear
and
steals
his
arm
about
it
what
dryad
could
this
win
to
that
amorous
grin
was
full
of
singing
bees
within
not
didymus
could
doubt
it
so
loud
they
buzzed
about
it
straight
a
bough
one
leg
he
throws
and
up
that
oaken
goes
with
reckless
red
unlarded
nose
and
gooseberry
eyes
of
wonder
till
now
as
in
a
galleon
hold
below
he
sees
great
cells
of
gold
whence
all
the
hollow
trunk
a
low
melodious
thunder
a
sweet
and
perilous
thunder
ay
there
within
that
hollow
tree
will
shakespeare
mightst
thou
truly
see
the
imperial
city
of
the
bee
in
chrysomelan
splendour
and
in
the
midst
one
dome
swells
that
titan
where
the
hath
her
home
with
such
as
do
attend
her
weaponed
with
stings
attend
her
but
now
her
singing
sentinels
have
turned
to
sleep
in
waxen
cells
and
bill
leans
down
his
face
and
smells
the
whole
sweet
summer
cargo
in
one
deep
breath
the
whole
year
bloom
lily
and
thyme
and
rose
and
broom
one
golden
fleece
of
in
that
old
oaken
argo
that
green
and
golden
argo
and
now
he
hangs
with
dangling
feet
over
that
dark
abyss
of
sweet
striving
to
reach
such
wild
gold
meat
as
none
could
buy
for
money
his
left
hand
grips
a
swinging
branch
when
crack
our
stout
and
stanch
falls
like
an
alpine
avalanche
feet
first
into
the
honey
up
to
his
ears
in
honey
and
now
his
red
unlarded
nose
and
bulging
eyes
are
all
that
shows
above
it
as
he
puffs
and
blows
and
now
to
the
scathing
of
that
black
host
of
furious
bees
his
nose
and
eyes
he
fain
would
grease
and
bobs
below
those
golden
seas
like
an
old
woman
bathing
old
mother
hubbard
bathing
and
now
he
struggles
all
in
vain
to
reach
some
little
bough
again
but
though
he
heaves
with
might
and
main
this
honey
holds
his
ribs
sirs
so
tight
a
barque
might
sooner
try
to
steer
a
cargo
through
the
sky
than
bill
thus
to
fly
by
flopping
of
his
jib
sirs
his
and
his
jib
sirs
like
oberon
in
the
hive
his
beard
with
wax
and
honey
all
besmeared
would
make
the
crescent
moon
afeard
that
now
is
sailing
brightly
right
his
leafy
but
that
she
knows
him
sunken
deep
and
that
his
tower
is
straight
and
steep
she
would
not
smile
so
lightly
look
down
and
smile
so
lightly
she
smiles
in
that
small
heavenly
space
ringed
with
the
leafy
grace
while
upward
grins
his
ghastly
face
as
if
some
satyr
some
gnomish
ptolemy
should
dare
up
that
dark
optic
tube
to
stare
as
all
unveiled
she
floated
there
poor
maiden
moon
straight
at
her
the
buccaneering
satyr
but
there
till
some
one
help
him
out
black
bill
must
stay
without
a
doubt
help
he
gives
a
muffled
shout
none
but
the
white
owls
hear
it
whoo
they
cry
bill
answers
me
am
stuck
fast
in
this
great
tree
bring
me
a
rope
good
timothy
there
honey
lads
we
share
it
ay
now
he
wants
to
share
it
then
thinking
help
may
come
with
morn
he
sinks
and
and
scarce
his
nose
exalts
its
horn
above
that
sea
of
glory
but
even
as
he
owns
defeat
his
belly
saith
a
man
must
eat
and
since
there
is
none
other
meat
come
lap
this
mess
before
this
glorious
mess
before
then
dian
sees
a
right
strange
sight
as
bidding
him
a
fond
she
flings
a
silvery
kiss
to
light
in
that
deep
hollow
and
finds
that
gold
and
crimson
nose
a
moving
munching
ravenous
rose
that
up
and
down
unceasing
goes
save
when
he
stops
to
swallow
he
finds
it
hard
to
swallow
ay
now
his
best
becomes
his
worst
for
honey
can
not
quench
his
thirst
though
he
should
eat
until
he
burst
but
ah
the
skies
are
kindly
and
from
their
tender
depths
of
blue
they
send
their
dew
so
bill
thrusts
out
his
tongue
anew
and
waits
to
catch
it
blindly
for
ah
the
stars
are
kindly
and
sometimes
with
a
shower
of
rain
they
strive
to
ease
their
prisoner
pain
then
bill
thrusts
out
his
tongue
again
with
never
a
grace
the
sinner
and
day
and
night
and
day
goes
by
and
never
a
comrade
comes
anigh
and
still
the
honey
swells
as
high
for
supper
breakfast
dinner
yet
bill
has
grown
no
thinner
the
young
moon
grows
to
full
and
throws
her
buxom
kiss
upon
his
nose
as
nightly
over
the
tree
she
goes
and
peeps
and
smiles
and
passes
then
with
her
fickle
silver
flecks
our
old
black
galleon
dreaming
decks
and
then
her
face
with
nods
and
becks
in
midmost
ocean
glasses
was
ever
the
way
with
lasses
ah
didymus
hast
thou
won
indeed
that
paradise
which
is
thy
meed
thy
tale
not
all
that
run
may
read
thy
sweet
hath
now
no
leaven
now
like
an
onion
in
a
cup
of
mead
thou
liest
for
jove
to
sup
could
polyphemus
lift
thee
up
with
titan
hands
to
heaven
this
great
to
heaven
the
second
canto
ceased
and
as
they
raised
their
with
the
last
triumphant
note
bacon
undaunted
raised
his
grating
voice
this
honey
which
in
some
sort
may
be
styled
the
spettle
of
the
stars
bring
the
canary
ben
jonson
roared
it
is
a
moral
wine
and
suits
the
third
last
canto
at
one
draught
john
davis
drained
it
and
began
anew
canto
the
third
a
month
went
by
we
were
hoisting
sail
we
had
lost
all
hope
of
bill
though
laugh
as
you
may
at
a
seaman
tale
he
was
fast
in
his
still
and
often
he
thinks
of
the
chaplain
word
in
the
days
he
shall
see
no
more
how
the
sweet
indeed
of
the
sour
hath
need
and
the
sea
likewise
of
the
shore
the
chaplain
word
of
the
air
and
a
bird
of
the
sea
likewise
and
the

of

yammers
my
nose
and
mine

the
bees
can
not
sting
me
at
all
and
it
o
for
the
sting
of
a
little
brown
bee
or
to
blister
my
hands
on
a
rope
or
to
buffet
a
thundering
sea
on
a
deck
like
a
with
her
mast
snapt
short
and
a

to

and
a

alas
and
he
thinks
of
the
chaplain
voice
when
that
roar
from
the
woods
now
wherefore
rejoice
in
the
music
a
bear
could
make
is
a
judgment

that

in

no

he
knew
not
our
anchor
was
heaved
from
the
mud
he
was
growling
it
over
again
when
a
strange
sound
suddenly
froze
his
blood
and
curdled
his
big
slow
brain
a
marvellous
sound
as
of
great
steel
claws
gripping
the
bark
of
his
tree
softly
ascended
like
lightning
ended
his
reverie
the
quivered
the
little
leaves
shivered
was
climbing
the
tree
something
that
breathed
like
a
fat
or
a
pirate
of
fourteen
ton
but
it
clomb
like
a
cat
tho
the
whole
tree
shook
stealthily
the
sun
till
as
black
bill
gapes
at
the
little
blue
ring
overhead
which
he
calls
the
sky
it
is
clean
blotted
out
by
a
monstrous
thing
which
larded
its
nose
and
its
o
well
for
thee
bill
that
this
monstrous
thing
hath
blinkered
its
little
red
eye
still
as
a
mouse
lies
bill
with
his
face
low
down
in
the
dark
sweet
gold
while
this
monster
turns
round
in
the
space
then
taking
a
good
firm
hold
as
the
skipper
descending
the
with
a
vast
slow
tread
solemnly
softly
cometh
this
bear
straight
down
the
head
solemnly
slowly
cometh
this
bear
the
head
nearer
nearer
then
all
bill
breath
in
one
leap
and
yell
and
this
bear
thinks
now
am
i
gripped
from
beneath
by
a
roaring
devil
from
hell
and
madly
bill
clutches
his
brown
and
madly
this
bear
doth
hale
with
his
little
red
eyes
for
the
skies
and
bill
teeth
fast
in
his
tail
small
wonder
a
bear
should
quail
to
have
larded
his
nose
to
have
greased
his
eyes
and
be
stung
at
the
last
in
his

sweet
gloom
pull

pull

pull
out
of
their
gold
with
a

boom
come
black

honeyed
thighs
pull
up
up
up
with
a
scuffle
and
scramble
to
that
little
blue
ring
of
bliss
this
bear
doth
go
with
our
in
tow
stinging
his
tail
i
and
this
bear
thinks
many
great
bees
i
know
but
there
never
was
bee
like
this
all
in
the
gorgeous
death
of
day
we
had
slipped
from
our
emerald
creek
and
our
i
the
was
careening
away
with
the
old
gay
flag
at
the
peak
when
suddenly
out
of
the
purple
wood
thro
the
lilies
there
danced
a
tall
lean
figure
black
as
a
nigger
that
shouted
and
waved
and
pranced
a
figure
but
black
as
a
nigger
waving
his
shirt
as
he
pranced
is
hylas
is
hylas
our
chaplain
flutes
and
our
skipper
he
looses
a
shout
is
bill
black
bill
in
his
old
by
to
bring
her
about
and
round
we
came
with
a
lurch
and
a
dip
and
a
roll
and
a
banging
boom
thro
the
gloom
for
our
old
black
soul
alive
not
dead
tho
behind
his
head
he
a
seraphin
aureole
and
our
chaplain
he
sniffs
as
bill
finished
his
tale
with
the
honey
still
scenting
his
hair
a
plate
of
salt
beef
and
a
mug
of
old
ale
by
pope
joan
there
no
sense
in
a
bear
and
we
laughed
but
our
he
solemnly
growls
till
the
sails
of
yon
heavens
be
furled
it
taketh
now
mark
all
the

and

sack

canary
malmsey
muscadel
as
the
last
canto
ceased
the
mermaid
inn
chorussed
i
flew
from
laughing
voice
to
voice
but
over
all
the
hubbub
rose
the
drone
of
francis
bacon
now
this
muscovy
is
a
cold
clime
not
favourable
to
bees
or
love
which
is
a
weakness
of
the
south
as
well
might
be
supposed
yet
as
hot
lands
gender
hot
fruits
and
odoriferous
spice
in
this
case
we
may
think
that
honey
and
flowers
are
comparable
with
the
light
airs
of
may
and
a
more
temperate
region
also
we
see
as
pliny
saith
this
honey
being
a
swette
of
heaven
a
certain
spettle
of
the
stars
which
gathering
unclean
vapours
as
it
falls
hangs
as
a
fat
dew
on
the
boughs
the
bees
obtain
it
partly
thus
and
afterwards
corrupt
it
in
their
stomachs
and
at
last
expel
it
through
their
mouths
and
harvest
it
in
hives
yet
of
its
heavenly
source
it
keeps
a
great
part
thus
by
various
principles
of
natural
philosophy
we
observe
and
as
he
leaned
to
drayton
droning
thus
i
saw
a
light
gleam
of
celestial
mirth
flit
the
face
of
shakespeare
scarce
a
smile
a
swift
irradiation
from
within
as
of
a
cloud
that
softly
veils
the
sun
iv
the
sign
of
the
golden
shoe
we
had
just
set
our
brazier
smouldering
to
keep
the
plague
away
many
a
house
was
marked
with
the
red
cross
the
bells
tolled
incessantly
nash
crept
into
the
room
shivering
like
a
fragment
of
the
night
his
face
yellow
as
parchment
and
his
eyes
burning
the
plague
he
has
taken
it
voices
cried
that
not
the
plague
the
old
is
drunk
but
stand
away
what
ails
you
nash
my
lad
then
through
the
clamour
as
through
a
storm
at
sea
the
master
voice
the
voice
of
ben
rang
out
nash
ben
leapt
to
his
feet
and
like
a
ship
shouldering
the
waves
he
shouldered
the
throng
aside
what
ails
you
man
what
that
upon
your
breast
blood
marlowe
is
dead
said
nash
and
stunned
the
room
to
silence
marlowe
dead
ben
caught
him
by
the
shoulders
nash
awake
what
do
you
mean
marlowe
kit
marlowe
dead
i
supped
with
him
why
not
three
nights
ago
you
are
drunk
you
are
dazed
there
blood
upon
your
coat
that
where
he
died
said
nash
and
suddenly
sank
sidelong
across
a
bench
bowing
his
head
between
his
hands
wept
i
believe
then
like
a
whip
of
steel
his
lean
black
figure
sprang
erect
again
marlowe
he
cried
kit
marlowe
killed
for
a
punk
a
taffeta
petticoat
killed
by
an
drunk
i
was
drunk
but
i
am
sober
now
sober
enough
by
god
poor
kit
is
dead
the
mermaid
inn
was
thronged
for
many
a
night
with
startled
faces
voices
rose
and
fell
as
i
recall
them
in
a
great
vague
dream
curious
pitiful
angry
thrashing
out
the
tragic
truth
then
all
along
the
cheape
the
waved
their
sheets
of
rhyme
croaking
buy
come
buy
the
bloody
death
of
wormall
writ
by
master
richard
bame
come
buy
come
buy
the
atheist
and
even
in
bread
street
at
our
very
door
the
crowder
to
his
cracked
old
fiddle
sang
was
a
poet
of
proud
repute
and
wrote
full
many
a
play
now
strutting
in
a
silken
suit
now
begging
by
the
then
out
of
the
hubbub
and
the
clash
of
tongues
the
bawdy
tales
and
scraps
of
balladry
as
out
of
chaos
rose
the
slow
round
world
at
last
though
for
the
mermaid
inn
alone
emerged
some
tragic
semblance
of
a
soul
some
semblance
of
the
rounded
truth
a
world
glimpsed
only
through
great
mists
of
blood
and
tears
yet
smitten
here
and
there
with
dreadful
light
as
i
believe
from
heaven
strangely
enough
though
ben
forgot
his
pipe
and
will
deep
eyes
deepened
and
softened
when
they
spoke
of
kit
for
many
a
month
thereafter
it
was
nash
that
took
the
blow
like
steel
into
his
heart
nash
our
piers
penniless
whom
rob
greene
had
called
young
juvenal
the
first
satirist
of
our
age
nash
of
the
biting
tongue
and
subtle
sneer
brooded
upon
it
till
his
grief
became
sharp
as
a
rapier
ready
to
lunge
in
hate
at
all
the
lies
of
shallower
hearts
one
night
the
night
he
raised
the
mists
from
that
wild
world
he
talked
with
chapman
in
the
mermaid
inn
of
marlowe
poem
that
was
left
his
and
kit
desired
if
he
died
first
that
you
should
finish
it
said
nash
a
loaded
silence
filled
the
room
as
with
the
imminent
spirit
of
the
dead
listening
and
long
that
picture
haunted
me
nash
like
a
lithe
young
mephistopheles
leaning
between
the
silver
across
the
oak
table
with
his
keen
white
face
dark
smouldering
eyes
and
black
dishevelled
hair
chapman
with
something
of
the
steady
strength
that
helms
our
ships
and
something
of
the
greek
the
cool
clear
passion
of
platonic
thought
behind
the
fringe
of
his
olympian
beard
and
broad
homeric
brows
confronting
him
gravely
there
was
a
burden
of
mystery
brooding
on
all
that
night
and
when
at
last
chapman
replied
i
knew
he
felt
it
too
the
curious
pedantry
of
his
wonted
speech
was
charged
with
living
undertones
like
truths
too
strange
and
too
tremendous
to
be
breathed
save
thro
a
mask
and
though
in
lines
that
flamed
once
with
strange
rivalry
shakespeare
himself
defied
chapman
that
spirit
by
spirits
taught
to
write
above
a
mortal
pitch
will
nimbler
sense
was
quick
to
breathings
from
beyond
our
world
and
could
not
hold
them
lightly
ah
then
kit
said
chapman
had
some
prescience
of
his
end
like
many
another
dreamer
what
strange
hints
of
things
past
present
and
to
come
there
lie
sealed
in
the
magic
pages
of
that
music
which
laying
strong
hold
on
universal
laws
ranges
beyond
these
of
the
flesh
though
dull
wits
fail
to
follow
it
was
this
that
made
men
find
an
oracle
in
the
books
of
vergil
and
an
everlasting
fount
of
science
in
the
prophets
once
again
that
haunted
silence
filled
the
shadowy
room
and
far
away
up
bread
street
we
could
hear
the
crowder
piping
of
black
wormall
still
had
a
friend
once
gay
and
green
who
died
of
want
alone
in
whose
black
fate
he
might
have
seen
the
warning
of
his
strange
he
should
ask
a
like
myself
to
crown
that
miracle
of
his
april
age
said
chapman
murmuring
softly
under
breath
leander
beautiful
and
why
nash
had
i
been
only
charged
to
raise
out
of
its
grave
in
the
green
hellespont
the
body
of
that
boy
to
make
him
sparkle
and
leap
thro
the
cold
waves
and
fold
young
hero
to
his
heart
again
the
task
were
scarce
as
hard
but
stranger
still
and
his
next
words
although
i
hardly
knew
all
that
he
meant
went
tingling
through
my
flesh
before
you
spoke
before
i
knew
his
wish
i
had
begun
to
write
i
knew
and
loved
his
work
himself
i
hardly
knew
at
all
and
yet
i
know
him
now
i
have
heard
him
now
and
since
he
pledged
me
in
so
rare
a
cup
i
lift
and
drink
to
him
though
lightnings
fall
from
envious
gods
to
scourge
me
i
will
lift
this
cup
in
darkness
to
the
soul
that
reigns
in
light
on
helicon
who
knows
how
near
for
i
have
thought
sometimes
when
i
have
tried
to
work
his
will
the
hand
that
moved
my
pen
was
mine
and
yet
not
mine
the
bodily
mask
is
mine
and
sometimes
dull
as
clay
it
sleeps
with
old
musæus
then
strange
flashes
come
oracular
glories
visionary
gleams
and
the
mask
moves
not
of
itself
and
sings
i
know
that
thought
said
nash
a
mighty
ship
a
wreck
out
in
that
night
unseen
has
foundered
thundering
we
sit
here
snug
on
the
shore
and
feel
the
wash
of
it
the
widening
circles
running
to
our
feet
can
such
a
soul
go
down
to
glut
the
sharks
without
one
ripple
here
comes
one
sprinkle
of
spray
listen
and
through
that
night
quick
and
intense
and
hushed
for
thunder
tingled
once
again
like
a
thin
wire
the
crowder
distant
tune
he
been
prenticed
to
the
trade
his
father
followed
still
this
exit
he
had
never
made
nor
played
a
part
so
here
is
another
said
nash
i
know
not
why
but
like
a
weed
in
the
long
wash
i
too
was
moved
not
of
myself
to
a
tune
like
this
o
i
can
play
the
crowder
fiddle
a
song
on
a
dead
friend
with
any
the
best
of
you
lie
and
kick
heels
in
the
sun
on
a
dead
man
grave
and
yet
god
knows
it
is
the
best
we
can
and
better
than
the
world
way
to
forget
so
saying
like
one
that
murmurs
happy
words
to
torture
his
own
grief
half
in
he
breathed
a
scrap
of
balladry
that
raised
the
mists
a
moment
from
that
paradise
that
primal
world
of
innocence
where
kit
in
childhood
played
outside
his
father
shop
under
the
sign
of
the
as
thus
a
cobbler
lived
in
canterbury
he
is
dead
now
poor
soul
he
sat
at
his
door
and
stitched
in
the
sun
nodding
and
smiling
at
everyone
for
hugh
makes
all
good
cobblers
merry
and
often
he
sang
as
the
pilgrims
passed
i
can
hammer
a
soldier
boot
and
daintily
glove
a
dainty
foot
many
a
sandal
from
my
hand
has
walked
the
road
to
holy
land
knights
may
fight
for
me
priests
may
pray
for
me
pilgrims
walk
the
pilgrim
way
for
me
i
have
a
work
in
the
world
to
do
the
bowl
the
bowl
to
good
hugh
the
cobbler
must
stick
to
his
last
and
anon
he
would
cry
kit
kit
kit
to
his
little
son
look
at
the
pilgrims
riding
by
dance
down
hop
down
after
them
run
then
like
an
unfledged
linnet
out
would
tumble
the
brave
little
lad
with
a
piping
shout
o
look
at
them
look
at
them
look
at
them
dad
priest
and
prioress
abbot
and
friar
soldier
and
seaman
knight
and
squire
how
many
countries
have
they
seen
is
there
a
king
there
is
there
a
queen
dad
one
day
thou
and
i
must
ride
like
this
all
along
the
pilgrim
way
by
glastonbury
and
samarcand
el
dorado
and
cathay
london
and
persepolis
all
the
way
to
holy
land
then
shaking
his
head
as
if
he
knew
under
the
sign
of
the
touched
by
the
glow
of
the
setting
sun
while
the
pilgrims
passed
the
little
cobbler
would
laugh
and
say
when
you
are
old
you
will
understand
is
a
very
long
way
to
samarcand
why
largely
to
exaggerate
befits
not
men
of
small
estate
but
i
should
say
yes
i
should
say
is
a
hundred
miles
from
where
you
stand
and
a
hundred
more
my
little
son
a
hundred
more
to
holy
land
i
have
a
work
in
the
world
to
do
the
bowl
the
bowl
to
good
hugh
the
cobbler
must
stick
to
his
last
which
last
said
nash
breaking
his
rhyme
off
short
the
crowder
after
his
kind
would
seem
to
approve
well
all
the
waves
from
that
great
wreck
out
there
break
and
are
lost
in
one
withdrawing
sigh
the
little
lad
that
used
to
play
around
the
cobbler
door
kit
marlowe
kit
marlowe
we
shall
not
see
him
more
but
could
i
tell
you
how
that
galleon
sank
could
i
but
bring
you
to
that
hollow
whirl
the
black
gulf
in
where
that
wreck
went
thundering
down
and
round
it
hell
still
roars
that
were
a
tale
to
snap
all
tell
me
said
chapman
ah
you
wondered
why
said
nash
you
wondered
why
he
asked
your
help
to
crown
that
work
of
his
why
chapman
think
think
of
the
cobbler
awl
there
a
stout
lance
to
couch
at
london
there
a
conquering
point
to
carry
in
triumph
through
persepolis
i
tell
you
kit
was
nothing
but
a
child
when
some
rich
patron
of
the
beheld
him
riding
into
samarcand
upon
a
broken
chair
the
which
he
said
was
a
white
steed
splashed
with
the
blood
of
kings
when
on
that
patron
bounty
he
did
ride
so
far
as
cambridge
he
was
a
brave
lad
untamed
adventurous
but
still
innocent
o
innocent
as
the
cobbler
little
self
he
brought
to
london
just
a
bundle
and
stick
a
slender
purse
an
ovid
a
few
scraps
of
song
and
all
unshielded
all
unarmed
a
child
heart
packed
with
splendid
hopes
and
dreams
i
say
a
child
heart
chapman
and
that
phrase
crowns
not
his
manhood
well
he
turned
an
honest
penny
taking
some
small
part
in
plays
at
the
and
all
the
while
beyond
the
paint
and
tinsel
of
the
stage
beyond
the
greasy
with
its
reek
of
and
civet
as
all
of
these
were
but
the
clay
churned
by
the
glorious
rush
of
his
white
chariots
and
his
burning
steeds
nay
as
the
clay
were
a
shadow
his
great
dreams
like
bannered
legions
on
some
proud
crusade
empurpling
all
the
deserts
of
the
world
swept
on
in
triumph
to
the
glittering
towers
of
his
abiding
city
then
he
met
that
damned
cockatrice
the
pug
of
some
fine
strutting
mummer
one
of
those
plagues
bred
by
our
stage
a
on
the
hill
of
helicon
as
for
his
wench
she
too
had
played
so
many
parts
that
she
forgot
the
cue
for
truth
king
puff
had
taught
her
well
he
was
the
vainer
and
more
foolish
thing
she
the
more
poisonous
one
dark
day
to
spite
archer
her
latest
paramour
a
friend
and
to
puff
she
set
her
eyes
on
marlowe
feigned
a
joy
in
his
young
art
murmured
his
songs
used
all
her
london
tricks
to
the
country
greenhorn
man
kit
never
even
her
painted
face
he
pored
on
books
by
and
saw
everything
thro
a
mist
o
i
could
laugh
to
think
of
it
only
his
skull
there
in
the
dark
now
that
the
flesh
drops
off
has
laughed
enough
a
horrible
silent
laugh
to
think
his
angel
of
light
was
after
all
only
the
angel
of
the
plague
he
was
no
better
than
the
rest
of
us
no
worse
he
felt
the
heat
he
felt
the
cold
he
took
her
down
to
deptford
to
escape
contagion
and
the
crashing
of
sextons
spades
on
dead
men
bones
in
every
churchyard
round
the
jangling
bell
and
the
cry
out
your
and
there
she
told
him
of
her
luckless
life
wedded
deserted
both
against
her
will
a
luckless
eve
that
never
knew
the
snake
true
and
she
mixed
in
one
wild
lie
and
then
she
caught
him
by
the
hand
and
wept
no
passed
to
warn
him
with
its
bell
her
eyes
her
perfumed
hair
and
her
red
mouth
her
warm
white
breast
her
skin
swimming
before
him
in
a
piteous
mist
made
the
lad
drunk
and
she
was
in
his
arms
and
all
that
god
had
meant
to
wake
one
day
under
the
sun
of
love
suddenly
woke
by
and
cried
sun
the
sun
and
he
believed
it
chapman
he
believed
it
he
was
a
cobbler
son
and
he
believed
in
love
blind
through
that
mist
he
caught
at
love
the
everlasting
king
of
all
this
world
kit
was
not
clever
clever
men
like
pomp
might
jest
and
fools
might
laugh
but
when
a
man
simple
as
all
great
elemental
things
makes
his
whole
heart
a
sacrificial
fire
to
one
whose
love
is
in
her
supple
skin
there
comes
a
laughter
in
which
jests
break
up
like
icebergs
in
a
sea
of
burning
marl
then
dreamers
turn
to
murderers
in
an
hour
then
topless
towers
are
burnt
and
the
tramples
the
proud
fleet
down
into
the
dark
and
sweeps
over
it
laughing
come
and
see
the
heart
now
of
this
darkness
no
more
waves
but
the
black
central
hollow
where
that
wreck
went
down
for
ever
how
should
piers
penniless
brand
that
wild
picture
on
the
world
black
heart
last
night
i
tried
the
way
of
the
florentine
and
bruised
myself
but
we
are
friends
together
mourning
a
dead
friend
none
will
ever
know
kit
do
you
smile
at
poor
piers
penniless
measuring
it
out
ah
boy
it
is
my
best
since
hearts
must
beat
let
it
be
a
ladder
of
rhyme
that
two
sad
friends
alone
may
let
down
thus
to
the
last
circle
of
hell
so
saying
and
motionless
as
a
man
in
trance
nash
breathed
the
words
that
raised
the
veil
anew
strange
intervolving
words
which
as
he
spake
them
moved
like
the
huge
slow
whirlpool
of
that
pit
where
the
wreck
sank
the
serpentine
slow
folds
of
the
lewd
kraken
that
sucked
it
shuddering
down
this
is
the
deptford
inn
climb
the
dark
stair
come
come
and
see
kit
marlowe
lying
dead
see
on
the
table
by
that
broken
chair
the
little
phials
of
paint
the
white
and
red
a
kerchief
hangs
behind
the
door
left
by
his
punk
even
as
the
tapster
said
there
is
the
taffeta
gown
she
wore
and
on
that
bed
as
is
most
meet
he
lies
alone
never
to
waken
more
o
still
as
chiselled
marble
the
frayed
sheet
folds
the
still
form
on
that
sepulchral
bed
hides
the
dead
face
and
peaks
the
rigid
feet
come
come
and
see
kit
marlowe
lying
dead
draw
back
the
sheet
ah
tenderly
lay
bare
the
splendour
of
that
apollonian
head
the
gloriole
of
his
hair
the
lean
athletic
body
deftly
planned
to
carry
that
swift
soul
of
fire
and
air
the
long
thin
flanks
the
broad
breast
and
the
grand
heroic
shoulders
look
what
lost
dreams
lie
cold
in
the
fingers
of
that
delicate
hand
and
shut
within
those
lyric
lips
what
cry
of
unborn
beauty
sunk
in
utter
night
lost
worlds
of
song
sealed
in
an
unknown
sky
never
to
be
brought
forth
clothed
on
with
light
was
this
then
this
the
secret
of
his
song
ever
loved
that
loved
not
at
first
it
was
not
love
not
love
that
wrought
this
wrong
and
yet
what
evil
shadow
of
this
dark
town
could
quench
a
soul
so
clean
and
strong
strike
the
young
glory
of
his
manhood
down
dead
like
a
dog
dead
in
a
drunken
brawl
dead
for
a
phial
of
paint
a
taffeta
gown
what
if
his
blood
were
hot
high
over
all
he
heard
as
in
his
song
the
world
still
hears
those
angels
on
the
burning
heavenly
wall
who
chant
the
of
the
spheres
yet
through
the
glory
of
his
own
young
dream
here
did
he
meet
that
face
wet
with
strange
tears
andromeda
with
piteous
face
astream
hailing
him
perseus
in
her
treacherous
eyes
as
in
dark
pools
the
mirrored
stars
will
gleam
here
did
he
see
his
own
eternal
skies
and
here
she
laughed
nor
found
the
dream
amiss
but
bade
him
pluck
and
eat
in
paradise
here
did
she
hold
him
broken
up
with
bliss
here
like
a
supple
snake
around
him
coiled
here
did
she
pluck
his
heart
out
with
a
kiss
here
were
the
wings
clipped
and
the
glory
soiled
here
adders
coupled
in
the
pure
white
shrine
here
was
the
wine
spilt
and
the
spoiled
black
was
that
feast
though
he
who
poured
the
wine
dreamed
that
he
poured
it
in
high
sacrament
deep
in
her
eyes
he
saw
his
own
eyes
shine
beheld
love
and
was
well
content
subtly
her
hand
struck
the
pure
silver
note
the
throbbing
chord
of
passion
that
god
meant
to
swell
the
bliss
of
heaven
round
his
young
throat
she
wound
her
swarthy
tresses
then
with
eyes
half
mad
to
see
their
power
half
mad
to
gloat
half
mad
to
batten
on
their
own
devilries
and
mark
what
splendours
they
could
quell
she
held
him
quivering
in
a
mesh
of
lies
and
in
soft
broken
speech
began
to
tell
there
as
against
her
heart
throbbing
he
lay
the
truth
that
hurled
his
soul
from
heaven
to
hell
quivering
she
watched
the
subtle
flay
the
white
flesh
of
the
dreams
of
his
pure
youth
then
sucked
the
blood
and
left
them
cold
as
clay
luxuriously
she
lashed
him
with
the
truth
against
his
mouth
her
subtle
mouth
she
set
to
show
as
through
a
mask
o
without
ruth
as
through
a
cold
clay
mask
brackish
and
wet
with
what
strange
tears
it
was
not
his
not
his
the
kiss
that
through
his
quivering
lips
she
met
kissing
him
she
whispered
he
kiss
ah
is
the
sweetness
like
a
sword
then
sweet
last
night
ah
kiss
again
aching
with
bliss
was
i
made
his
own
from
head
to
a
sudden
agony
thro
his
body
swept
wedded
pulses
this
and
this
and
then
at
dawn
he
she
laughed
pouting
her
lips
against
his
cheek
to
drink
and
as
in
answer
marlowe
wept
as
a
dead
man
in
dreams
he
heard
her
speak
clasped
in
the
bitter
grave
of
that
sweet
clay
wedded
and
one
with
it
he
moaned
too
weak
even
to
lift
his
head
sobbing
he
lay
then
slowly
as
their
breathings
rose
and
fell
he
felt
the
storm
of
passion
far
away
gather
the
shuddering
waves
began
to
swell
and
through
the
menace
of
the
the
thin
quick
lightnings
thrilling
through
his
hell
lightnings
that
hell
itself
could
not
control
even
while
she
strove
to
bow
his
neck
anew
woke
the
great
slumbering
legions
of
his
soul
sharp
was
that
severance
of
the
false
and
true
sharp
as
a
sword
drawn
from
a
shuddering
wound
but
they
that
were
one
flesh
were
cloven
in
two
flesh
leapt
from
clasping
flesh
without
a
sound
he
plucked
his
body
from
her
white
embrace
and
cast
him
down
and
grovelled
on
the
ground
yet
ere
he
went
he
strove
once
more
to
trace
deep
in
her
eyes
the
loveliness
he
knew
then
spat
his
hatred
into
her
smiling
face
she
clung
to
him
he
flung
her
off
he
drew
his
dagger
thumbed
the
blade
and
laughed
poor
punk
what
would
you
make
me
your
own
murderer
too
that
was
the
day
of
our
great
feast
said
nash
aboard
the
the
grand
old
hulk
was
drawn
up
for
the
citizens
wonderment
at
deptford
ay
piers
penniless
was
there
soaked
and
besotted
as
i
was
i
saw
everything
on
her
poop
the
minstrels
played
and
round
her
keel
like
curtseying
round
a
oak
prentices
and
their
sweethearts
heel
and
toe
danced
the
brave
english
dances
clean
and
fresh
as
may
but
in
her
broad
waist
once
red
with
british
blood
long
tables
groaned
for
revellers
not
so
worthy
where
her
guns
had
raked
the
seas
barrels
of
ale
were
sprung
bestrid
by
roaring
tipplers
where
at
night
the
crew
silently
bowed
their
heads
with
drake
before
the
king
of
life
and
death
a
strumpet
wrestled
with
a
mountebank
for
pence
a
lais
with
a
clown
of
cherry
hilton
leering
at
their
lewd
twists
upon
the
deck
sluggish
with
sack
like
a
squat
toad
sat
puff
propped
up
against
the
bulwarks
at
his
side
archer
his
hiccoughed
a
bawdy
song
suddenly
through
that
orgy
with
wild
eyes
yet
with
her
customary
smile
o
there
i
saw
in
daylight
what
kit
marlowe
saw
through
blinding
mists
the
face
of
his
first
love
she
stood
before
her
paramour
on
the
deck
cocking
her
painted
head
to
right
and
left
her
white
teeth
smiling
but
her
voice
a
hiss
she
said
to
archer
away
or
there
be
blood
spilt
blood
than
wine
said
archer
struggling
to
his
feet
who
who
would
spill
blood
she
said
then
puff
reeled
to
his
feet
kit
the
cobbler
son
the
lad
that
broke
his
leg
at
the
he
that
would
chain
kings
to
what
is
he
rushing
hither
he
would
spill
blood
for
gloriana
hey
o
my
belphoebe
you
will
crack
my
sides
was
this
the
wench
that
shipped
a
thousand
squires
o
ho
but
here
he
comes
now
solemnly
lads
walk
the
angels
on
the
walls
of
heaven
to
entertain
divine
zenocrate
and
there
stood
kit
high
on
the
poop
against
the
sky
i
saw
his
face
pale
innocent
just
the
dear
face
of
that
boy
who
walked
to
cambridge
with
a
bundle
and
stick
the
little
cobbler
son
yet
there
i
caught
my
only
glimpse
of
how
the
looked
and
only
for
one
moment
when
he
saw
his
mistress
his
face
whitened
and
he
shook
down
to
the
deck
he
came
a
poor
weak
man
and
yet
by
god
the
only
man
that
day
in
all
our
drunken
crew
along
kit
cried
puff
all
be
friends
now
all
take
hands
and
dance
ha
ha
the
shaking
of
the
sheets
then
archer
shuffling
a
step
raised
his
cracked
voice
in
kit
own
song
to
a
falsetto
tune
snapping
one
hand
thus
over
his
head
as
he
danced
live
with
me
and
be
my
love
and
we
will
all
the
pleasures
prove
puff
reeled
between
laughing
you
cried
kit
and
catching
the
fat
swine
by
his
round
soft
throat
hurled
him
headlong
crashing
across
the
tables
to
lie
and
groan
in
the
red
bilge
of
wine
that
washed
the
scuppers
kit
gave
him
not
one
glance
he
said
in
a
whisper
instantly
a
long
thin
rapier
flashed
in
archer
hand
the
ship
was
one
wild
uproar
women
screamed
and
huddled
together
a
drunken
clamorous
ring
seethed
around
marlowe
and
his
enemy
kit
drew
his
dagger
slowly
and
i
knew
blood
would
be
spilt
take
my
rapier
kit
i
cried
across
the
crowd
seeing
the
lad
was
armed
so
slightly
but
he
did
not
hear
i
could
not
reach
him
all
at
once
he
leapt
like
a
wounded
tiger
past
the
rapier
point
straight
at
his
enemy
throat
i
saw
his
hand
to
strike
i
heard
a
harlot
scream
and
in
the
hand
stayed
quivering
white
a
frozen
menace
i
saw
a
yellow
claw
twisting
the
dagger
out
of
that
frozen
hand
i
saw
his
own
steel
in
that
yellow
grip
his
own
lost
lightning
raised
to
strike
at
him
i
saw
it
flash
i
heard
the
driving
grunt
of
him
that
struck
then
with
a
shout
the
crowd
sundered
and
through
the
gap
a
blank
red
thing
streaming
with
blood
came
the
blind
face
of
kit
reeling
to
me
and
i
poor
drunken
i
held
my
arms
wide
for
him
here
on
my
breast
with
one
great
sob
he
burst
his
heart
and
died
nash
ceased
and
far
away
down
friday
street
the
crowder
with
his
fiddler
wailed
again
tambolin
must
die
and
faustus
meet
his
end
repent
repent
or
presentlie
to
hell
ye
must
and
as
in
answer
chapman
slowly
breathed
those
mightiest
lines
of
marlowe
own
despair
thou
that
i
who
saw
the
face
of
god
and
tasted
the
eternal
joys
of
heaven
am
not
tormented
with
ten
thousand
hells
ah
you
have
said
it
said
nash
and
there
you
know
why
kit
desired
your
hand
to
crown
his
work
he
reverenced
you
as
one
whose
temperate
eyes
austere
and
grave
could
look
him
through
and
through
one
whose
firm
hand
could
grasp
the
reins
of
law
and
guide
those
furious
horses
of
the
sun
as
ben
and
will
can
guide
them
where
you
will
his
were
perchance
the
noblest
steeds
of
all
and
from
their
nostrils
blew
a
fierier
dawn
above
the
world
that
glory
is
his
own
but
where
he
fell
he
fell
before
his
hand
had
learned
to
quell
them
he
was
dashed
to
the
earth
is
yours
to
show
that
good
men
honoured
him
for
mark
this
chapman
since
kit
marlowe
fell
there
will
be
fools
that
in
the
name
of
art
will
wallow
in
the
mire
crying
fall
i
fall
from
heaven
fools
that
have
only
heard
from
earth
the
rumour
of
those
golden
hooves
far
far
above
them
yes
you
know
the
kind
the
fools
that
scorn
will
for
his
lack

he
quells
the
storms
they
never
knew
and
rides
above
the
thunder
fools
of
art
that
skip
and
vex
like
little
vicious
fleas
their
only
helicon
some
green

art
o
god
that
i
could
send
my
soul
in
one
last
wave
from
that
wreck
across
the
shores
of
all
the
years
to
be
o
god
that
like
a
crowder
i
might
shake
their
blind
dark
casements
with
the
pity
of
it
piers
penniless
his
ballad
a
poor
scrap
that
but
for
lack
of
time
and
hope
and
pence
he
might
have
bettered
for
a
dead
man
sake
thus
would
the
wave
break
thus
the
crowder
cry
dead
like
a
dog
upon
the
road
dead
for
a
harlot
kiss
the
apollonian
throat
and
brow
the
lyric
lips
so
silent
now
the
flaming
wings
that
heaven
bestowed
for
loftier
airs
than
this
the
eyes
whose
light
and
life
had
gazed
an
angel
down
that
burning
heart
of
honey
and
fire
quenched
and
dead
for
an
quenched
at
the
thrust
of
a
mummer
knife
dead
for
a
taffeta
gown
the
wine
that
god
had
set
apart
the
noblest
wine
of
all
wine
of
the
grapes
that
angels
trod
the
vintage
of
the
glory
of
god
the
crimson
wine
of
that
rich
heart
spilt
in
a
drunken
brawl
poured
out
to
make
a
steaming
bath
that
night
in
the
devil
inn
a
steaming
bath
of
living
wine
poured
out
for
circe
and
her
swine
a
bath
of
blood
for
a
harlot
to
supple
and
sleek
her
skin
and
many
a
fool
that
finds
it
sweet
through
all
the
years
to
be
crowning
a
lie
with
marlowe
fame
will
ape
the
sin
will
ape
the
shame
will
ape
our
captain
in
defeat
but
not
in
victory
till
art
become
a
and
death
be
crowned
as
life
and
one
wild
jest
outshine
the
soul
of
truth
o
fool
is
this
your
goal
you
are
not
our
kit
marlowe
but
the
drunkard
with
the
knife
not
marlowe
but
the
that
lured
him
the
fen
o
ay
the
tavern
is
in
its
place
and
the
punk
painted
smiling
face
but
where
is
our
kit
marlowe
the
man
the
king
of
men
passion
you
kiss
the
painted
mouth
the
hand
that
clipped
his
wings
the
hand
that
into
his
heart
she
thrust
and
tuned
him
to
her
whimpering
lust
and
played
upon
his
quivering
youth
as
a
crowder
plucks
the
strings
but
he
who
dared
the
whose
could
soar
buffeting
down
the
clouds
of
night
to
beat
against
the
light
of
light
that
great
we
shall
not
see
him
more
v
the
companion
of
a
mile
thwack
one
early
dawn
upon
our
door
i
heard
the
bladder
of
some
motley
fool
bouncing
and
all
the
dusk
of
london
shook
with
bells
i
leapt
from
bed
had
i
forgotten
i
flung
my
casement
wide
and
craned
my
neck
over
the
painted
mermaid
there
he
stood
his
right
leg
yellow
and
his
left
leg
blue
with
jingling
cap
a
at
his
tail
wielding
his
bladder
thwack
bang
catching
a
comrade
head
with
the
recoil
and
skipping
away
all
bread
street
dimly
burned
like
a
reflected
sky
green
red
and
white
with
littered
branches
ferns
and
for
round
sir
fool
a
frolic
of
players
poets
prentices
queans
robins
and
marians
coloured
like
the
dawn
and
sparkling
like
the
greenwood
whence
they
came
with
their
fresh
boughs
all
dewy
from
the
dark
clamoured
down
come
down
and
let
us
in
high
over
these
i
suddenly
saw
sir
fool
leap
to
a
swing
to
a
and
perch
there
gorgeous
on
the
morning
sky
tossing
his
crimson
cockscomb
to
the
blue
and

as
i
seized

i
saw

cantering
down
a
pasteboard
steed
dappled
a
rosy
white
like
bridled
with
purple
bitted
with
gold
a
crimson
on
his
royal
flanks
and
riding
him
his
majesty
of
the
may
round
him
the
whole
crowd
frolicked
with
a
shout
and
as
i
stumbled
down
the
crooked
stair
i
heard
them
break
into
a
dance
and
sing
song
i
into
the
woods
we
trip
and
go
up
and
down
and
to

of
spring
into
the
town
with
our
fresh
boughs
and
knock
at
every
sleeping
house
not
sighing
or
crying

no
denying
then
round
your
summer
queen
and
king
come

the
great
fool
tossed
his
gorgeous
crest
and
lustily
crew
against
the
deepening
dawn
till
all
the
cheape
caught
the
refrain
and
with
a
double
thunder
of
frolic
feet
its
ancient
tabors
woke
the
strand
for
love

trips
not
even
so
come
young
lovers
trip
and
go
trip
and
go
into
the
mermaid
with
a
shout
they
rushed
as
i
shot
back
the
bolts
and
thwack

the
bladder
bounced
about
me
what
cared

this
was
all

tuck
of
this
mad
morrice
come
you
into
church
my
nightingales
my
scraps

lincoln

and
hear
my
sermon
on
a
he
stood
against
the
diamonded
rich
panes
in
the
old
oak
parlour
and
throwing
back
his
hood
who
should
it
be
but
ben
rare
ben
himself
the
wild
troup
laughed
around
him
some
on
tables
kicking
heels
some
with
their
marians
jigging
on
their
knees
and
in
the
front
of
all
the
motley
fool
upon
the
rushes
o
i
knew
him
will
kemp
the
player
who
danced
from
london
town
to
norwich
in
nine
days
and
was
proclaimed
freeman
of
marchaunt
venturers
and
of
english
for
ever
his
wonder
through
the
countryside
was
hawked
by
every
kemp
raged
at
their
muses
none
but
i
guessed
ever
for
what
reason
since
he
chose
his
anticks
for
himself
and
in
his
games
was
more
than
most
fantastical
i
watched
his
thin
face
as
he
rocked
and
crooned
shaking
the
squirrels
tails
around
his
ears
and
out
of
all
the
players
i
had
seen
his
face
was
quickest
through
its
clay
to
flash
the
passing
mood
though
not
a
muscle
stirred
the
very
skin
of
it
seemed
to
flicker
and
gleam
with
little
summer
lightnings
of
the
soul
at
every
fleeting
fancy
for
a
man
so
quick
to
bleed
at
a
or
to
leap
laughing
through
hell
to
save
a
butterfly
this
world
was
difficult
and
perchance
he
found
in
his
fantastic
games
that
open
road
which
even
will
shakespeare
only
found
at
last
in
motley
and
with
some
wild
straws
in
his
hair
but
drawer

make
ready
a
righteous
breakfast
while
i
preach

of

and
cold

flaunes
tarts
and
clotted

hath

and

a

and
manchet
bread
away
be
swift
and
as
i
bustled
to
and
fro
the
friar
raised
his
big
brown
fists
again
and
preached
in
mockery
of
the
puritans
who
thought
to
strip
the
moonshine
wings
from
mab
tear
down
the
rout
our
english
games
and
drive
all
beauty
back
into
the
sea
then
laughter
and
chatter
and
clashing
tankards
drowned
all
but
their
jollity
but
as
their
breakfast
ended
and
i
sank
gasping
upon
a
bench
there
came
still
more
poets
and
players
crowding
into
the
room
and
one
i
only
knew
him
as
sir
john
waved
a
great
ballad
at
will
kemp
and
laughed
atonement
will
atonement
what
groaned
kemp
another
penny
poet
how
many
lies
does
rogue
tell
sir
i
have
suffered
much
from
these
melpomenes
and
strawberry
quills
and
think
them
better
at
their
bloody
lines
on
blue
sir
they
set
to
work
at
seven
in
the
morning
the
same
hour
that
i
myself
that
kemp
with
heels
of
feather
and
heart
of
cork
began
frolickly
footing
from
the
great
lord
mayor
of
london
the
worshipful
master
mayor
of
norwich
nay
kemp
this
is
a
tune
a
morrice
of
country
rhymes
made
by
a
poet
who
thought
it
shame
so
worthy
an
act
as
thine
should
wither
in
oblivion
if
the
muse
with
her
castalian
showers
could
keep
it
green
and
while
the
fool
all
in
time
sir
john
in
swinging
measure
trolled
this
tale
i
with
georgie
sprat
my
overseer
and
thomas
slye
my
tabourer
and
william
bee
my
courier
when
dawn
emblazed
the
skies
i
met
a
tall
young
butcher
as
i
danced
by
little
sudbury
o
all
high
headborough
of
hyes
by
sudbury
by
sudbury
by
little
sudbury
he
wished
to
dance
a
mile
with
me
i
made
a
courtly
bow
i
fitted
him
with
with
treble
bass
and
tenor
bells
and
your
tabor
i
cried
going
to
market
and
rollicking
down
the
lanes
we
dashed
and
frolicking
up
the
hills
we
clashed
and
like
a
sail
behind
me
flapped
his
great
white
frock
till
with
a
gasp
he
sank
and
swore
that
he
could
dance
with
me
no
more
and
over
the
hedge
a
laughed
dance
with
him
a
you
lout
she
laughed
i
leave
my
pail
and
dance
with
him
for
cakes
and
ale
i
dance
a
mile
for
love
she
laughed
and
win
my
wager
too
your
feet
are
shod
and
mine
are
bare
but
when
could
leather
dance
on
air
a
feet
can
fall
as
fair
and
light
as
falling
dew
i
fitted
her
with
with
treble
bass
and
tenor
bells
the
as
i
linked
them
at
her
throat
how
soft
they
sang
green
linnets
in
a
golden
nest
they
chirped
and
trembled
on
her
breast
and
faint
as
elfin
at
her
ankles
rang
i
fitted
her
with
that
sweetened
into
woodbine
bells
and
trembled
as
i
hung
them
there
and
crowned
her
sunny
brow
strike
up
she
laughed
my
summer
king
and
all
her
bells
began
to
ring
and
your
tabor
i
cried
going
to
sherwood
when
cocks
were
crowing
and
light
was
growing
and
horns
were
blowing
and
flowing
we
swam
thro
waves
of
emerald
gloom
along
a
chestnut
aisle
then
up
a
shining
we
sailed
into
the
sun
again
will
kemp
and
his
companion
his
companion
of
a
mile
truer
than
most
snarled
kemp
but
mostly
lies
and
why
does
he
forget
the
miry
lanes
by
brainford
with
thick
woods
on
either
side
and
the
deep
holes
where
i
could
find
no
ease
but
skipped
up
to
my
waist
a
crackling
laugh
broke
from
his
lips
which
if
he
had
not
worn
the
cap
and
bells
would
scarce
have
roused
the
mirth
of
good
sir
john
who
roundly
echoed
it
then
waved
his
hand
and
said
nay
but
he
treats
your
morrice
in
the
spirit
of
lucian
will
who
thought
that
dancing
was
no
mushroom
growth
but
sprung
from
the
beginning
of
the
world
when
love
persuaded
earth
air
water
fire
and
all
the
jarring
elements
to
move
in
measure
right
to
the
heart
of
it
my
lad
the
song
goes
though
the
skin
mislike
you
so
nay
an
there
more
of
it
i
sing
it
too
is
a
fine
tale
sir
john
i
have
it
by
heart
although
is
lies
throughout
up
leapt
will
kemp
and
crouched
and
swayed
and
swung
his
bauble
round
making
the
measure
as
they
trolled
the
tale
chanting
alternately
each
answering
each
ii
the
tabor
fainted
far
behind
us
but
her
feet
that
day
they
beat
a
rosier
morrice
the
green
and
a
field
of
buttercups
a
field
of
lambs
and
buttercups
we
danced
along
a
cloth
of
gold
a
summer
king
and
queen
and
straying
we
went
and
swaying
we
went
with
lambkins
round
us
playing
we
went
her
face
uplift
to
drink
the
sun
and
not
for
me
her
smile
we
danced
a
king
and
queen
of
may
upon
a
fleeting
but
o
she
won
her
wager
my
companion
of
a
mile
her
rosy
lips
they
never
spoke
though
every
rosy
broke
the
dust
the
dust
to
and
past
the
throbbing
blue
all
ordered
to
her
rhythmic
feet
the
stars
were
dancing
with
my
sweet
and
all
the
world
a
she
knew
not
but
i
knew
love
like
amphion
with
his
lyre
made
all
the
elements
conspire
to
build
his
world
of
music
all
in
rhythmic
rank
and
file
i
saw
them
in
their
cosmic
dance
catch
hands
across
retire
advance
for
me
and
my
companion
my
companion
of
a
mile
the
little
leaves
on
every
tree
the
rivers
winding
to
the
sea
the
swinging
tides
the
wheeling
winds
the
rolling
heavens
above
around
the
igdrasil
they
worked
the
will
persuaded
into
measure
by
the
love
that
hour
i
saw
from
depth
to
height
this
wildering
universe
unite
the
lambs
of
god
around
us
and
his
passion
in
every
flower
his
grandeur
in
the
dust
his
dust
a
blaze
of
blinding
majesty
and
all
his
immortality
in
one
poor
mortal
hour
and
death
was
but
a
change
of
key
in
life
the
golden
melody
and
time
became
eternity
and
heaven
a
fleeting
smile
for
all
was
each
and
each
was
all
and
all
a
wedded
unity
her
heart
in
mine
and
mine
in
my
companion
of
a
mile
he
whirled
his
bauble
round
about
this
fellow
beats
them
all
he
cried
the
worst
those
others
wrote
was
that
i
hopped
from
york
to
paris
with
a
mortar
on
my
head
this
fellow
sends
me
leaping
through
the
clouds
to
buss
the
moon
the
best
is
yet
to
come
strike
up
sir
john
ha
ha
you
know
no
more
kemp
leapt
upon
a
table
clear
the
way
he
cried
and
with
a
great
stamp
of
his
foot
and
a
wild
crackling
laugh
drew
all
to
hark
with
hey
and
ho
through
thick
and
thin
the
is
forgotten
but
i
must
finish
what
i
begin
tho
all
the
roads
be
rotten
by
all
those
twenty
thousand
chariots
ben

this
true
tale

shall
now
let
me
see
where
was
will
kemp
bussing
the
moon
pale
mouth
ah
yes
he
crouched
above
the
listening
throng
as
a
i
heard
one
whispering
quean
and
waving
his
bauble
shuffling
with
his
feet
in
a
dance
that
marked
the
time
he
sank
his
voice
as
if
to
breathe
great
secrets
and
so
sang
iii
at
melford
town
at
melford
town
at
little
melford
town
a
long
mile
from
sudbury
upon
the
village
green
we
danced
into
a
merry
rout
of
that
skipt
about
a
a
and
a
laughing
queen
they
thronged
about
us
as
we
stayed
and
there
i
gave
my
sunshine
maid
an
english
crown
for
cakes
and
ale
her
dancing
was
so
true
and
nay
she
said
i
danced
my
mile
for
love
i
answered
with
a
smile
is
but
a
silver
token
lass
won
that
wager
too
i
took
my
leash
of
my
treble
bass
and
tenor
bells
they
pealed
like
distant
and
up
came
william
bee
with
georgie
sprat
my
overseer
and
thomas
slye
my
tabourer
farewell
she
laughed
and
vanished
with
a
suffolk
courtesie
i
leapt
away
to
rockland
and
from
rockland
on
to
hingham
from
hingham
on
to
norwich
sirs
i
hardly
heard
the
throngs
that
followed
after
with
their
shouting
and
their
laughter
for
a
shadow
danced
beside
me
my
companion
of
a
mile
at
norwich
by
giles
his
gate
i
entered
and
the
mayor
in
state
with
all
the
rosy
knights

for
twenty
miles
about
with
trumpets
and
with
minstrelsy
was
waiting
there
to
welcome
me
and
as
i
skipt
into
the
street
the
city
raised
a
shout
they
gave
me
what
i
did
not
seek
i
fed
on
roasted
swans
a
week
they
pledged
me
in
their
malmsey
and
they
lined
me
warm
with
ale
they
sleeked
my
skin
with
pies
and
all
that
runs
and
swims
and
flies
but
through
the
clashing
o
i
heard
her
clanking
pail
and
rising
from
his
crimson
chair
the
worshipful
and
portly
mayor
bequeathed
me
forty
shillings
every
year
that
i
should
live
with
five
good
angels
in
my
hand
that
i
might
drink
while
i
could
stand
they
gave
me
golden
angels
what
i
lacked
they
could
not
give
they
made
will
kemp
thenceforward
sirs
freeman
of
marchaunt
venturers
they
hoped
that
i
would
dance
again
from
norwich
up
to
york
then
they
asked
me
all
together
had
i
met
with
right
may
weather
and
they
praised
my
heels
of
feather
and
my
heart
my
heart
of
cork
as
i
came
home
by
sudbury
by
little
sudbury
i
waited
for
my
maid
among
her
satin
kine
i
heard
a
peal
of
of
treble
bass
and
tenor
bells
ring
well
i
cried
this
bridal
morn

soon
shall
ring
for
mine
i
found
her
in
the
grass
just
where
she
stood
and
saw
me

within
her

sweet
field
and
waited
for
my
may

go
by
with
laughter
and
with
minstrelsy
i
gazed
across
her

sweet
hedge
i
caught
her
happy
smile
i
saw
the
tall
young
butcher
pass
to
little
sudbury
his
bride
upon
his
arm
my
lost
companion
of
a
down
from
his
table
leapt
the
motley
fool
his
bladder
bounced
from
head
to
ducking
head
his
crackling
laugh
rang
high
sir

i
danced
in

liars
all
away
to
fenchurch
street

and
lads
they
hold
high
revel
there
this
morn
away
the
throng
echoed
the
cry
he
drove
them
with
his
bauble
through
the
door
then
as
the
last
gay
kerchief
fluttered
out
he
gave
one
little
sharp
sad
lingering
cry
as
of
a
breaking
he
turned
back
and
threw
himself
along
a
low
dark
bench
his
jingling
cap
was
crumpled
in
his
fist
and
as
he
lay
there
all
along
cheapside
the
happy
voices
of
his
comrades
rang
out
of
the
woods
we
dance
and
sing
under
the
of
spring
into
the
town
with
our
fresh
boughs
and
knock
at
every
sleeping
house
not
sighing
or
crying
though
love
knows
no
denying
then
round
your
summer
queen
and
king
come
young
lovers
dance
and
sing

and
sing
his
motley
shoulders
heaved
i
touched
his
arm
what
ails
you
sir
he
raised
his
thin
white
face
wet
with
the
still
a
few
stray
petals
clung
in
his
tangled
hair
he
leapt
to
his
feet
was
february
but
i
danced
boy
danced
in
may
can
you
do
this
forward
he
bent
over
his
feet
and
shuffled
it
heel
and
toe
out
of
the
mermaid
singing
his
old
song
for
love
knows
no
wisdom

not
even
so
come
young
lovers

and
go

and
go
five
minutes
later
over
the
roaring
strand
i
heard
him
crow
and
half
the
town
reeled
into
music
under
his
crimson
comb
vi
big
ben
gods
what
a
hubbub
shook
our
cobwebs
out
the
day
that
chapman
marston
and
our
ben
waited
in
newgate
for
the
hangman
hands
chapman
and
marston
had
been
flung
there
first
for
some
imagined
insult
to
the
scots
in
the
play
they
wrote
with
ben
but
ben
was
famous
now
and
our
brave
law
would
fain
have
winked
and
passed
the
big
man
by
the
lesser
men
had
straightway
been
condemned
to
have
their
ears
cut
off
their
noses
slit
with
other
tortures
ben
had
risen
at
that
he
gripped
his
cudgel
called
for
a
quart
of
ale
then
like
helvellyn
with
his
rocky
face
and
he
surged
along
cheapside
snorting
with
wrath
and
rolled
into
the
gaol
to
share
the
punishment
there
is
my
mark
is
not
the
first
time
you
have
branded
me
said
our
big
ben
and
thrust
his
broad
left
thumb
branded
with
t
for
tyburn
into
the
face
of
every
protest
that
the
mark
you
gave
me
because
i
killed
my
man
in
spitalfields
a
duel
honest
as
any
your
courtiers
fight
but
i
was

no

out
the
mermaid
inn
buzzed
like
a
hornet
nest
upon
the
day
fixed
for
their
mutilation
and
the
stings
were
ready
too
for
rapiers
flashed
and
clashed
among
the
tankards
dekker

there
and
nash
brome
jonson
whom
he
taught
his
art
of
verse
and
more
than

to

him
and
half
a
dozen
more
they
planned
to
meet
the
prisoners
going
to
tyburn
and
attempt
a
desperate
rescue
all
at
once
we
heard
a
great
gay
song
come
marching
down
the
street
a
single
voice
and
twenty
marching
men
then
the
full
chorus
twenty
voices
strong
the
prentice
whistles
at
break
of
day
all
under
fair
roofs
and
towers
when
the
old
cheape
openeth
every
way
her
little
sweet
inns
like
flowers
and
he
sings
like
a
lark
both
early
and
late
to
think
if
his
house
take
fire
at
the
good
in
bishopsgate
he
may
drink
to
his
heart
desire
or
sit
at
his
ease
in
the
old
and
drink
to
his
heart
desire
but
i
as
i
walk
by

tho
it
warmeth
my
heart
to
see

and
with
the

set
wide
for

at

and
in
came
ben
like
a
great
galleon
poised
high
on
the
white
crest
of
a
shouting
wave
and
then
the
feast
began
the
fragrant
steam
as
from
the
kitchens
of
olympus
drew
a
throng
of
ragged
urchins
to
our
doors
ben
ordered
them
a
castellated
pie
that
rolled
a
cloud
around
them
where
they
sat
munching
upon
the
cobblestones
our
casements
dripped
with
the
golden
dews
of
helicon
and
under
the
warm
feast
our
cellarage
gurgled
and
foamed
in
the
delicious
cool
with
crimson
freshets
tell
us
cried
nat

when
pipes
began
to
puff
how
did
you
work
it
camden
chuckled
and
tugged
his
long
white
beard
out
of
the
mouth
of
babes
he
said
and
shook
his
head
at
selden
o
young
man
young
man
there
a
career
before
you
selden
did
it
take
my
advice
my
children
make
young
selden
to
the
mermaid
inn
that
rosy
silken
smile
of
his
conceals
a
scholar
yes
that
suckling
lawyer
there
puts
my
grey
beard
to
shame
his
courteous
airs
and
silken
manners
hide
the
nimblest
wit
that
ever
trimmed
a
sail
to
catch
the
wind
of
courtly
favour
mark
my
words
now
ben
that
youth
will
sail
right
up
against
the
wind
by
skilful
tacking
but
you
run
it
fine
selden
you
run
it
fine
take
my
advice
and
do
be
too
ironical
my
boy
or
even
the
king
will
see
it
he
chuckled
again
but
tell
them
of
your
tractate
here
it
is
quoth
selden
twisting
a
lighted
paper
spill
then
with
his
round
cherubic
face
aglow
lit
his
long
silver
pipe
why
first
he
said
camden
being
clarencieux
he
read
the
king
this
little
tract
i
wrote
against
tobacco
and
the
mermaid
roared
with
laughter
well
you
went
the
way
to
hang
all
three
of
them
cried
lyly
and
as
for
ben
his
trinidado
goes
to
bed
with
him
green
gosling
quack
no
more
selden
replied
smiling
that
rosy
silken
smile
anew
the
king
a
when
have
critics
known
the
poet
from
his
creatures
god
from
me
how
many
cite
polonius
to
their
sons
and
call
it
shakespeare
well
i
took
my
text
from
sundry
creatures
of
our
great
big
ben
and
called
it
camden
read
it
out
without
the
flicker
of
an
eye
his
beard
saved
us
i
think
the
king
admired
his
text
is
a
he
read
at
death
door
thro
taking
of
tobacco
yesterday
he
voided
a
bushel
of
bless
my
soul
a
bushel
of
soot
think
of
it
said
the
king
man
who
wrote
those
great
and
splendid
words
camden
replied
i
had
prepared
his
case
carefully
in
newgate
prison
sire
his
nose
and
ears
await
the
hangman
knife
said
the
shrewd
king
goggling
his
great
eyes
cannily
he
not
defame
the
scots
true
said
camden
like
a
man
that
hears
truth
for
the
first
time
ay
he
defamed
the
king
said
very
wisely
once
again
but
says
camden
like
a
man
that
strives
with
more
than
mortal
wit
such
scots
as
flout
your
majesty
and
take
tobacco
he
is
a
scot
himself
and
hath
the
gift
of
preaching
then
we
gave
him
jonson
lines
against
virginia
do
thou
lust
after
that
tawny
weed
for
who
can
tell
before
the
gathering
and
the
making
up
what
alligarta
may
have
spawned
or
words
to
that
effect
spluttered
the
king
knows
who
knows
indeed
that
a
grand
touch
that
alligarta
camden
scot
who
wrote
those
great
and
splendid
words
said
camden
in
newgate
sire
his
ears
and
nose
and
there
as
we
arranged
with
inigo
jones
the
ladies
of
the
court
assailed
the
king
in
tears
their
masque
and
ball
would
all
be
ruined
all
their
grecian
robes
procured
at
vast
expense
were
wasted
now
the
masque
was
not
master
jones
had
lost
his
poets
they
were
all
in
gaol
their
noses
and
their
ears
bless
my
soul
spluttered
the
king
goggling
his
eyes
again
make
of
it
camden
should
say
a
puritan
plot
sire
for
these
justices
who
love
tobacco
use
their
law
it
seems
to
flout
your
majesty
at
every
turn
if
this
continue
sire
there
not
be
left
a
loyal
ear
or
nose
in
all
your
realm
at
that
our
noble
monarch
swooned
he
hunched
his
body
padded
as
it
was
against
the
assassin
knife
six
inches
deep
with
great
green
quilts
wagged
his
enormous
head
then
in
a
dozen
words
he
wooed
destruction
is
presumption
and
a
high
contempt
in
subjects
to
dispute
what
kings
can
do
he
whimpered
as
it
is
blasphemy
to
thwart
the
will
of
god
he
waved
his
hand
and
rose
men
must
be
released
at
once
then
as
i
think
to
seek
a
safer
place
he
waddled
from
the
room
his
rickety
legs
doubling
beneath
that
great
green
he
calls
his
i
shall
dream
of
spiders
but
in
half
an
hour
inigo
jones
was
armed
with
right
divine
to
save
such
ears
and
noses
as
the
ball
required
for
its
perfection
think
of
that
and
let
this
earthly
ball
remember
too
that
chapman
marston
and
our
great
big
ben
owe
their
poor
adjuncts
to
ten
grecian
robes
and
on
tobacco
england

supremely
when
they
dead
but
ben
has
narrowly
escaped
her
love
said
chapman
gravely
what
do
you
mean
said
lodge
and
as
he
spoke
there
was
a
sudden
hush
a
tall
gaunt
woman
with
great
burning
eyes
and
white
hair
blown
back
softly
from
a
face
ethereally
fierce
as
might
have
looked
cassandra
in
old
age
stood
at
the
door
where
is
my
ben
she
said
mother
cried
ben
he
rose
and
caught
her
in
his
mighty
arms
her
hands
entwined
behind
his
neck
she
brought
this
to
the
gaol
said
chapman
quietly
tossing
a
phial
across
to
camden
and
he
meant
to
take
it
too
before
the
hangman
touched
him
half
an
hour
and
you
have
been
too
late
to
save
big
ben
he
has
lived
too
much
in
ancient
rome
to
love
a
slit
nose
and
the
pillory
he
have
wrapped
his
purple
round
him
like
an
emperor
i
think
she
had
another
for
herself
there
roman
blood
in
both
of
them
said
dekker
do
look
she
is
weeping
now
and
while
ben
held
that
gaunt
old
body
sobbing
against
his
heart
dekker
to
make
her
think
they
paid
no
heed
began
to
sing
and
very
softly
now
full
forty
voices
echoed
the
refrain
cardinal
is
a
very
good
inn
and
so
is
puritan
but
i
know
a
sign
of
a
wine
a
wine
that
is
better
when
all
is
said
it
is
whiter
than
venus
redder
than
mars
it
was
old
when
the
world
begun
for
all
good
inns
are
moons
or
stars
but
is
their
sun
they
are
all
alight
like
moons
in
the
night
but
is
their
sun
therefore
when
priest
or
parson
cries
that
inns
like
flowers
increase
i
say
that
mine
inn
is
a
church
likewise
and
i
say
to
them
be
at
peace
an
host
may
gather
in
dark
to
salve
their
souls
from
sin
but
the
light
may
be
where
two

vii
the
burial
of
a
queen
was
on
an
all
souls
eve
that
our
good
inn
whereof
for
ten
years
now
myself
was
host
heard
and
took
part
in
its
most
eerie
tale
it
was
a
bitter
night
and
master
ben
his
hair
now
flecked
with
grey
though
youth
still
fired
his
deep
and
ageless
eyes
in
the
old
over
the
roaring
hearth
puffed
at
his
pipe
a
little
sad
as
often
i
found
him
now
remembering
vanished
faces
yet
the
years
brought
others
round
him
wreaths
of
heliochrise
gleamed
still
in
that
great
tribe
of
benjamin
burned
still
across
the
malmsey
and
muscadel
chapman
and
browne
herrick
a
name
like
thyme
crushed
into
sweetness
by
a
maid
milking
at
dewy
dawn
in
these
three
came
late
and
sat
in
a
little
room
aside
supping
together
on
one
great
pie
whereof
both
crust
and
coffin
were
prepared
by
master
herrick
receipt
and
all
washed
down
with
mighty
cups
of
sack
this
left
with
ben
john
ford
wrapped
in
his
cloak
brooding
aloof
drayton
and
lodge
and
drummond
of
hawthornden
suddenly
in
the
porch
i
heard
a
sound
of
iron
that
grated
on
the
flags
a
spade
and
pick
came
edging
through
the
door
o
room
room
for
the
muttered
ford
and
grey
old
sexton
scarlet
hobbled
in
he
shuffled
off
the
snow
that
clogged
his
boots
on
my
clean
rushes
brushed
it
from
his
cloak
of
northern
russet
wiped
his
rheumatic
knees
blew
out
his
lanthorn
hung
it
on
a
nail
leaned
his
rude
pick
and
spade
against
the
wall
flung
back
his
rough
frieze
hood
flapped
his
gaunt
arms
and
called
for
ale
come
to
the
fire
said
lodge
room
for
the
wisest
counsellor
of
kings
the
kindly
sage
that
puts
us
all
to
bed
and
tucks
us
up
beneath
the
quilt
plenty
of
work
eh
timothy
said
ben
work
where
my
liquor
o
ay
there
work
to
spare
old
scarlet
croaked
then
quaffed
his
creaming
stoup
while
ben
said
softly
pity
you
could
not
spare
you
and
your
some
of
the
golden
lads
that
i
have
seen
here
in
the
mermaid
inn
then
with
a
quiet
smile
he
shook
his
head
and
turned
to
master
drummond
of
hawthornden
well
songs
are
good
but
flesh
and
blood
are
better
the
grey
old
tomb
of
horace
glows
for
me
across
the
centuries
with
one
little
fire
lit
by
a
girl
light
hand
then
under
breath
yet
with
some
passion
he
murmured
this
brief
rhyme
i
laughing
through
the
ages
o
fairer
far
to
me
rarer
than
the
wisdom
of
all
his
golden
pages
floats
the
happy
laughter
of
his
vanished
lalage
ii
we
hear
it
and
we
know
it
so
musical
and
low
mightier
than
marble
is
my
song
ah
did
the
poet
know
why
little
lalage
was
mightier
even
so
iii
through
all
the
years
that
sever
clear
as
yon
hawthorn
hedge
we
heard
her
passing
by
a
song
may
live
for
ever
but
lalage
must
die
i
like
to
learn
that
rhyme
the
sexton
said
i
a
fine
memory
too
you
start
me
now
i
keep
it
up
all
night
with
ancient
ballads
and
then
a
strange
thing
happened
i
saw
john
ford
with
folded
arms
and
melancholy
hat
as
in
our
mermaid
jest
he
still
would
sit
watching
old
scarlet
like
a
man
in
trance
the
sexton
gulped
his
ale
and
smacked
his
lips
then
croaked
again
o
ay
there
work
to
spare
we
fills
faster
than
the
spades
can
dig
and
all
at
once
the
lights
burned
low
and
blue
ford
leaned
right
forward
with
his
grim
black
eyes
widening
why
that
a
marvellous
ring
he
said
and
pointed
to
the
sexton
gnarled
old
hand
spread
on
the
black
like
the
claw
of
some
great
bird
of
prey
a
ruby
worth
the
ransom
of
a
queen
the
fire
leapt
up
the
sexton
stared
at
him
then
stretched
his
hand
out
with
its
nails
full
in
the
light
a
grim
hand
but
bare
as
it
was
born
there
was
a
ring
i
could
have
sworn
it
red
as
blood
cried
ford
and
ben
and
lodge
and
drummond
of
hawthornden
all
stared
at
him
for
such
a
silent
soul
was
master
ford
that
when
he
suddenly
spake
it
struck
the
rest
as
dumb
as
if
the
sphinx
had
opened
its
cold
stone
lips
he
would
sit
mute
brooding
aloof
for
hours
his
cloak
around
him
a
staff
between
his
knees
as
if
prepared
for
a
long
journey
a
lonely
pilgrimage
to
some
dark
tomb
a
strange
and
sorrowful
soul
yet
not
as
many
thought
him
harsh
or
hard
but
of
a
most
kind
patience
though
he
wrote
in
blood
they
say
the
blood
came
from
his
heart
and
all
the
sufferings
of
this
world
he
took
to
his
own
soul
and
bade
them
pasture
there
till
out
of
his
compassion
he
became
a
monument
of
bitterness
he
rebelled
and
so
fell
short
of
that
celestial
height
whereto
the
greatest
only
climb
who
stand
by
shakespeare
and
accept
the
eternal
law
these
find
in
law
firm
footing
for
the
soul
the
strength
that
binds
the
stars
and
reins
the
sea
the
base
of
being
the
pillars
of
the
world
the
pledge
of
honour
the
pure
cord
of
love
the
form
of
truth
the
golden
floors
of
heaven
these
men
discern
a
height
beyond
all
heights
a
depth
below
all
depths
and
never
an
end
without
a
pang
beyond
it
and
a
hope
without
a
heaven
beyond
it
and
a
hell
for
these
despair
is
like
a
bubble
pricked
an
old
romance
to
make
young
lovers
weep
for
these
the
law
becomes
a
fiery
road
a
jacob
ladder
through
that
vast
abyss
lacking
no
rung
from
realm
to
loftier
realm
nor
wanting
one
degree
from
dust
to
wings
these
at
the
last
radiant
with
victory
lay
their
strong
hands
upon
the
wingèd
steeds
and
fiery
chariots
and
exult
to
hold
themselves
the
throbbing
reins
whereby
they
steer
the
stormy
splendours
he
being
less
rebelled
cried
out
for
unreined
steeds
and
unruled
stars
an
unprohibited
ocean
and
a
truth
untrue
and
the
equal
thunder
of
the
law
hurled
him
to
night
and
chaos
who
was
born
to
shine
upon
the
forehead
of
the
day
and
yet
the
voice
of
darkness
and
despair
may
speak
for
heaven
where
heaven
would
not
be
heard
may
fight
for
heaven
where
heaven
would
not
prevail
and
the
consummate
splendour
of
that
strife
swallowing
up
all
discords
all
defeat
in
one
huge
victory
harmonising
all
make
lucifer
at
last
at
one
with
god
there
on
that
all
souls
eve
you
might
have
thought
a
dead
man
spoke
to
see
how
drayton
stared
and
drummond
started
you
saw
no
ruby
ring
the
old
sexton
muttered
sullenly
if
you
did
the
worse
for
me
by
all
accounts
the
lights
burned
low
you
caught
the
firelight
on
my
fist
what
was
it
like
this
ring
a
band
of
gold
and
a
great
ruby
fit
to
burn
between
the
breasts
of
laïs
am
i
awake
or
dreaming
well
that
makes
the
second
time
there
many
have
said
they
saw
it
out
of
jest
to
scare
me
for
the
astrologer
did
say
the
third
time
i
should
die
now
did
you
see
it
most
likely
someone
told
you
that
old
tale
you
had
heard
it
now
ford
shook
his
head
what
tale
said
ben
o
you
could
make
a
book
about
my
life
i
talked
with
quick
and
dead
and
neither
ghost
nor
flesh
can
fright
me
now
i
wish
it
was
a
ring
so
i
could
catch
him
and
sell
him
but
i
never
seen
him
yet
a
white
witch
told
me
if
i
did
i
go
clink
just
like
that
to
heaven
or
place
whirled
in
a
fiery
chariot
with
ten
steeds
the
way
elijah
went
for
i
have
seen
so
many
mighty
things
that
i
must
die
mightily
well
i
came
sirs
to
my
craft
the
day
mine
uncle
robert
dug
the
grave
for
good
queen
katharine
she
whose
heart
was
broke
by
old
king
harry
a
very
great
while
ago
maybe
you
heard
about
my
uncle
sirs
he
was
for
his
in
depth
in
speed
in
neatness
he
no
match
they
put
a
fine
slab
to
his
memory
in
peterborough
cathedral
scarlet
sexton
for
half
a
it
says
peterborough
cathedral
where
he
built
the
last
sad
habitation
for
two
queens
and
many
hundreds
of
the
common
sort
and
now
himself
who
for
so
many
built
eternal
habitations
others
have
anno
ætatis
july
the
second
fifteen
we
should
do
well
sir
with
a
slab
like
that
should
we
and
the
sexton
leered
at
lodge
not
many
boasts
a
finer
slab
than
that
there
many
a
king
done
worse
ah
well
you
see
he
a
fine
record
living
to
he
buried
generations
of
the
poor
a
countless
host
and
thought
no
more
of
it
than
digging
potatoes
he
a
lofty
mind
that
found
no
satisfaction
in
small
deeds
but
from
his
burying
of
two
queens
he
drew
a
lively
pleasure
could
he
have
buried
a
third
it
would
indeed
have
crowned
his
old
white
hairs
but
he
was
famous
and
he
thought
perchance
a
third
were
mere
so
he
died
i
helped
him
with
the
second
the
old
man
leered
to
see
the
shaft
go
home
ben
filled
the
stoup
with
ale
so
that
quoth
he
began
the
tale
about
this
ruby
ring
but
who
said
lodge
who
was
the
second
queen
a
famous
queen
and
a
great
lover
when
you
hear
her
name
your
hearts
will
leap
her
beauty
passed
the
bounds
of
modesty
men
say
yet
she
died
young
we
buried
her
at
midnight
there
were
few
that
knew
it
for
the
high
state
funeral
was
held
upon
the
morrow
lammas
morn
anon
you
shall
hear
why
a
strange
thing
that
to
see
the
mourners
weeping
round
a
hearse
that
held
a
dummy
coffin
stranger
still
to
see
us
lowering
the
true
coffin
down
by
torchlight
with
some
few
of
her
true
friends
in
peterborough
cathedral
all
alone
old
as
the
world
said
ford
it
is
the
way
of
princes
their
true
tears
and
smiles
are
seen
at
dead
of
night
like
ghosts
raised
from
the
grave
and
all
the
luxury
of
their
brief
bright
noon
cloaks
but
a
dummy
throne
a
mask
of
life
and
at
the
last
drapes
a
false
catafalque
holding
a
vacant
urn
a
mask
of
death
but
tell
tell
on
the
sexton
took
a
draught
of
ale
and
smacked
his
lips
mine
uncle
lived
a
mile
or
more
from
peterborough
then
and
past
his
cottage
in
the
dead
of
night
her
royal
coach
came
creeping
through
the
lanes
with
scutcheons
round
it
and
no
crowd
to
see
and
heralds
carrying
torches
in
their
hands
and
none
to
admire
but
him
and
me
and
one
a
who
lodged
with
us
that
week
and
paid
his
lodging
with
a
bunch
of
rhymes
by
these
he
said
my
uncle
robert
fame
should
live
as
in
a
picture
till
the
crack
of
doom
my
uncle
thought
that
he
should
pay
beside
but
when
the
man
declared
the
thought
unworthy
of
these
august
events
my
uncle
was
abashed
and
truth
to
tell
the
rhymes
were
mellow
though
here
and
there
he
swerved
from
truth
to
make
them
so
nor
would
he
change
to
for
all
that
we
could
say
never
said
the
month
was
june
he
cried
if
i
did
shakespeare
hath
jumped
an
age
gods
will
you
hedge
me
round
with
thirty
nights
june
rhymes
with
moon
with
that
he
flung
them
down
and
strode
away
like
lucifer
and
was
gone
before
old
scarlet
could
approach
again
the
matter
of
that
yet
his
rhymes
have
caught
the
very
colours
of
that
night
i
can
see
through
them
ay
just
as
through
our
cottage
can
see
the
great
black
coach
carrying
the
dead
queen
past
our
the
roses
bobbing
and
fluttering
to
and
fro
hide
and
yet
show
the
more
by
hiding
half
and
like
smoked
glass
through
which
you
see
the
sun
the
song
shows
truest
when
it
blurs
the
truth
this
is
the
way
it
goes
he
rose
to
his
feet
picked
up
his
spade
and
struck
an
attitude
leaning
upon
it
i
got
to
feel
my
spade
or
i
forget
it
this
is
the
way
i
speak
it
always
and
with
a
schoolboy
rigid
face
and
eyes
fixed
on
the
rafters
he
began
the
bunch
of
rhymes
as
i
went
by
the
the
grey
dew
dimmed
the
grass
and
under
a
twisted
old
robin
scarlet
stood
by
me
keep
watch
keep
watch
he
said
there
things
come
to
pass
keep
watch
until
the
moon
has
cleared
the
thatch
of
yonder
rick
then
i
come
out
of
my
to
wait
for
the
coach
of
a
queen
once
more
and
you
say
nothing
of
what
you
heard
but
rise
and
follow
me
quick
and
what
i
see
if
i
keep
your
trust
and
wait
and
watch
so
late
pride
he
said
and
pomp
he
said
beauty
to
haunt
you
till
you
dead
and
glorious
dust
that
goes
to
dust
passing
the
white
you
are
young
and
all
for
adventure
lad
and
the
great
tales
to
be
told
this
night
before
the
clock
strike
one
your
lordliest
hour
will
all
be
done
but
you
remember
it
and
be
glad
in
the
days
when
you
are
old
all
in
the
middle
of
the
night
my
face
was
at
the
pane
when
creeping
out
of
his
to
wait
for
the
coach
of
a
queen
once
more
old
scarlet
in
the
beckoned
to
me
again
he
stood
beneath
a
like
father
time
for
dole
in
reading
tawny
cloak
and
hood
with
mattock
and
with
spade
he
stood
and
far
away
to
southward
a
bell
began
to
toll
he
stood
beneath
a
and
never
a
word
he
said
but
as
i
stole
out
of
the
house
he
pointed
over
the
orchard
boughs
where
not
with
dawn
or
sunset
the
northern
sky
grew
red
i
followed
him
and
half
in
fear
to
the
old
again
and
round
the
curve
of
the
long
white
road
i
saw
that
the
hedges
glowed
red
with
the
grandeur
drawing
near
and
the
torches
of
her
train
they
carried
her
down
with
singing
with
singing
sweet
and
low
slowly
round
the
curve
they
came
twenty
torches
dropping
flame
the
heralds
that
were
bringing
her
the
way
we
all
must
go
was
master
william
dethick
the
garter
king
of
arms
before
her
royal
coach
did
ride
with
none
to
see
his
coat
of
pride
for
peace
was
on
the
countryside
and
sleep
upon
the
farms
peace
upon
the
red
farm
peace
upon
the
grey
peace
on
the
heavy
orchard
trees
and
little
cottages
peace
upon
the
wayside
and
sleep
upon
the
way
so
master
william
dethick
with
forty
horse
and
men
like
any
common
man
and
mean
rode
on
before
the
queen
the
queen
and
only
a
wandering
pedlar
could
tell
the
tale
again
how
like
a
cloud
of
darkness
between
the
torches
moved
four
black
steeds
and
a
velvet
pall
crowned
with
the
crown
imperiall
and
on
her
shield
the
lilies
the
lilies
that
she
loved
ah
stained
and
ever
stainless
ah
white
as
her
own
hand
white
as
the
wonder
of
that
brow
crowned
with
colder
lilies
now
white
on
the
velvet
darkness
the
lilies
of
her
land
the
witch
from
over
the
water
the
fay
from
over
the
foam
the
bride
that
rode
thro
edinbro
town
with
satin
shoes
and
a
silken
gown
a
queen
and
a
great
king
daughter
thus
they
carried
her
home
with
torches
and
with
scutcheons
unhonoured
and
unseen
with
the
lilies
of
france
in
the
wind
and
the
lion
of
scotland
over
her
darkly
in
the
dead
of
night
they
carried
the
queen
the
queen
the
sexton
paused
and
took
a
draught
of
ale
was
there
he
said
i
joined
at
the
gate
my
uncle
and
the
pedlar
what
they
sang
the
little
shadowy
throng
of
men
that
walked
behind
the
scutcheoned
coach
with
bare
bent
heads
i
know
not
but
was
very
soft
and
low
they
walked
behind
the
rest
like
shadows
flung
behind
the
from
that
strange
dark
hearse
and
some
said
afterwards
they
were
the
ghosts
of
lovers
that
this
queen
had
brought
to
death
a
foolish
thought
it
seemed
to
me
and
yet
like
the
they
sang
and
there
was
one
an
man
the
pedlar
said
was
like
a
certain
foreigner
that
she
loved
one
chastelard
a
wild
french
poet
of
hers
also
the
pedlar
thought
they
sang
in
words
like
this
and
that
the
words
in
french
were
written
by
the
hapless
queen
herself
when
as
a
girl
she
left
the
vines
of
france
for
scotland
and
the
halls
of
holyrood
i
though
thy
hands
have
plied
their
trade
eighty
years
without
a
rest
robin
scarlet
never
thy
spade
built
a
house
for
such
a
guest
carry
her
where
in
earliest
june
all
the
whitest
hawthorns
blow
carry
her
under
the
midnight
moon
singing
very
soft
and
low
slow
between
the
low
green
larches
carry
the
lovely
lady
sleeping
past
the
low
white
farms
along
the
way
carry
her
through
the
summer
darkness
weeping
weeping
weeping
weeping
answering
only
to
any
that
ask
you
whence
ye
carry
her
ii
she
was
gayer
than
a
child
your
torches
droop
for
laughter
in
her
eyes
ran
wild
her
down
to
words
were
kisses
in
her
mouth
no
word
of
blame
be
she
was
queen
of
all
the
south
the
north
her
heart
was
they
should
have
left
her
in
her
vineyards
left
her
heart
to
her
land
own
keeping
left
her
white
breast
room
to
breathe
and
left
her
light
foot
free
to
dance
out
of
the
cold
grey
northern
mists
we
carry
her
weeping
weeping
weeping
ma
patrie
la
plus
chérie
adieu
plaisant
pays
de
france
iii
many
a
red
heart
died
to
beat
swelled
in
holyrood
once
beneath
her
fair
white
feet
the
floors
may
rot
with
she
was
young
and
her
deep
hair
and
rain
were
all
her
fate
trapped
young
love
as
in
a
snare
the
wind
a
sword
in
the
canongate
edinboro
edinboro
music
built
the
towers
of
troy
but
thy
grey
walls
are
built
of
sorrow
hills
and
sorrowful
glens
of
thrifty
sowing
and
iron
reaping
what
if
her
foot
were
fair
as
a
sunbeam
how
should
it
touch
or
melt
your
snows
what
if
her
hair
were
a
silken
mesh
hands
of
steel
can
deal
hard
blows
iron
bruise
fair
flesh
carry
her
southward
palled
in
purple
weeping
weeping
weeping
weeping
what
had
their
rocks
to
do
with
roses
body
and
soul
she
was
all
one
rose
thus
through
the
summer
night
slowly
they
went
we
three
behind
the
and
i
and
robin
scarlet
the
moving
flare
that
ringed
the
escutcheoned
hearse
lit
every
leaf
distinct
along
the
hedges
and
woke
the
sleeping
birds
but
drew
no
watchers
from
the
drowsier
farms
thus
through
a
world
of
innocence
and
sleep
we
brought
her
to
the
doors
of
her
last
home
in
peterborough
cathedral
round
her
tomb
they
stood
in
the
huge
gloom
of
those
old
aisles
the
heralds
with
their
torches
but
their
light
struggled
in
vain
with
that
tremendous
dark
their
ring
of
smoky
red
could
only
show
a
few
sad
faces
round
the
purple
pall
the
wings
of
a
stone
angel
overhead
the
base
of
three
great
pillars
and
fitfully
faint
as
the
phosphorus
glowing
in
some
old
vault
one
little
slab
of
marble
far
away
yet
or
the
darkness
or
the
pedlar
words
had
made
me
fanciful
i
thought
i
saw
bowed
shadows
praying
in
those
unplumbed
aisles
nay
dimly
heard
them
weeping
in
a
grief
that
still
was
built
of
silence
like
the
drip
of
water
from
a
frozen
we
laid
her
in
her
grave
we
closed
the
tomb
with
echoing
footsteps
all
the
funeral
went
and
i
went
last
to
close
and
lock
the
doors
last
and
half
frightened
of
the
enormous
gloom
that
rolled
along
behind
me
as
one
by
one
the
torches
vanished
o
i
was
glad
to
see
the
moonlight
on
the
kind
again
but
as
i
turned
the
key
a
quivering
hand
was
laid
upon
my
arm
i
turned
and
saw
that
foreigner
with
the
face
from
head
to
foot
he
shivered
as
with
cold
he
drew
me
into
the
shadows
of
the
porch
back
with
me
he
whispered
and
slid
his
hand
like
ice
it
was
along
my
wrist
and
slipped
a
ring
upon
my
finger
muttering
quick
as
in
a
burning
fever
the
wealth
of
eldorado
for
one
hour
come
back
i
must
go
back
and
see
her
face
again
i
was
not
there
not
there
the
day
she
died
you
help
me
with
the
coffin
not
a
soul
will
know
come
back
one
moment
only
one
i
thought
the
man
was
mad
and
plucked
my
hand
away
from
him
he
caught
me
by
the
sleeve
and
sank
upon
his
knees
lifting
his
face
most
piteously
to
mine
moment
see
i
loved
her
i
saw
the
moonlight
glisten
on
his
tears
great
long
slow
tears
they
were
and
then
my
god
as
his
face
lifted
and
his
head
sank
back
beseeching
me
i
saw
a
crimson
thread
circling
his
throat
as
though
the
headsman
axe
had
cloven
it
with
one
blow
so
shrewd
so
keen
the
head
had
slipped
not
from
the
trunk
i
gasped
and
as
he
pleaded
stretching
his
head
back
the
wound
o
like
a
second
awful
mouth
the
wound
began
to
gape
i
tore
my
cloak
out
of
his
clutch
my
keys
fell
with
a
clash
i
left
them
where
they
lay
and
with
a
shout
i
dashed
into
the
broad
white
empty
road
there
was
no
soul
in
sight
sweating
with
fear
i
hastened
home
not
daring
to
look
back
but
as
i
turned
the
corner
i
heard
the
clang
of
those
great
doors
and
knew
he
had
entered
in
not
till
i
saw
before
me
in
the
lane
the
pedlar
and
my
uncle
did
i
halt
and
look
at
that
which
clasped
my
finger
still
as
with
a
band
of
ice
my
hand
was
bare
i
stared
at
it
and
rubbed
it
then
i
thought
i
had
been
dreaming
there
had
been
no
ring
the
poor
man
i
had
left
there
in
the
porch
being
a
frenchman
talked
a
little
wild
but
only
wished
to
look
upon
her
grave
and
i
i
was
the
madman
so
i
said
nothing
but
all
the
same
for
all
my
thoughts
i
not
go
back
that
night
to
find
the
keys
no
not
for
all
the
rubies
in
the
crown
of
prester
john
the
high
state
funeral
was
held
on
lammas
day
a
wondrous
sight
for
peterborough
for
myself
i
found
small
satisfaction
in
a
catafalque
that
carried
a
dummy
coffin
none
the
less
the
pedlar
thought
that
as
a
solemn
masque
or
piece
of
purple
pomp
the
thing
was
good
and
worthy
of
a
picture
in
his
rhymes
the
more
because
he
said
it
shadowed
forth
the
ironic
face
of
death
the
masque
indeed
began
before
we
buried
her
for
a
host
of
mourners
lords
and
ladies
on
lammas
eve
panting
with
eagerness
of
pride
and
place
arrived
in
readiness
for
the
morrow
pomp
and
at
the
bishop
palace
they
found
prepared
a
mighty
supper
for
them
where
they
sat
all
at
one
table
in
a
chamber
hung
with
and
black
cloth
they
drank
red
wine
and
feasted
while
the
torches
and
the
queen
crept
through
the
darkness
of
northampton
lanes
at
seven
on
lammas
morn
they
woke
after
the
queen
was
buried
and
at
eight
the
masque
set
forth
thus
pictured
in
the
rhymes
with
tolling
bells
which
on
the
pedlar
lips
had
more
than
paid
his
lodging
thus
he
spake
it
slowly
sounding
the
rhymes
like
solemn
bells
and
tolling
in
between
with
lingering
tongue
from
the
palace
the
releevants
creep
a
hundred
poor
old
women
nigh
their
end
wearing
their
black
cloth
gowns
and
on
each
head
an
ell
of
holland
which
some
said
afterwards
they
might
keep
toll
with
nine
new
shillings
each
to
spend
for
all
the
trouble
that
they
had
and
all
the
sorrow
of
walking
to
this
funeral
and
the
mourning
cloaks
in
purple
streamed
following
a
long
procession
two
by
two
her
household
first
with
these
monsieur
du
preau

french
confessor
unafraid
to
show

golden
cross

about
his
neck

what
the
crowd
might
do
said

wear
it
though
i
die
for
it
so
subtle
in
malice
was
that
jesuit
sir
george
savile
in
his
mourner
gown
carried
the
solemn
cross
upon
a
field
azure
and
under
it
by
a
streamer
borne
upon
a
field
of
gules
an
unicorn
argent
and
lower
down
a
scrolled
device
upon
a
blazoned
shield
which
seemed
to
say
i
am
silent
till
the
end

my
defence

a
hundred
poor
old
men

deep

empty
coffin

control
the
fair
white
staves

with
a
bow

gives
them
to
her

great
earls

sweeps
them
onward
in
her
mournful
train
at
the
high
cathedral
door
the
quires

them
and
lead
them
singing
all
the
while

mighty
for

in

with

with

inscrolled
round
the
rich

of
scotland
as
to
say

judged

i
abide
the
judgment
day
the
sexton
paused
anew
all
looked
at
him
and
at
his
wrinkled
grim
hand
as
if
in
that
dim
light
beclouded
now
with
blue
they
thought
to
see
the
smouldering
ruby
again
ye
know
he
said
how
master
william
wickham
preached
that
day
ford
nodded
i
have
heard
of
it
he
showed
subtly
o
very
subtly
after
his
kind
that
the
white
body
of
beauty
such
as
hers
was
in
itself
papistical
a
feast
a
fast
an
incense
a
and
an
abomination
in
the
sight
of
all
true
protestants
why
her
very
name
was
mary
ay
that
true
that
very
true
the
sexton
mused
now
that
a
strange
deep
thought
the
bishop
missed
a
text
in
missing
that
her
name
indeed
was
mary
did
you
find
your
keys
again
ay
sir
i
found
them
where
strange
you
should
ask
me
that
after
the
throng
departed
and
the
nobles
were
at
feast
all
in
the
bishop
palace
a
great
feast
and
worthy
of
their
sorrow
i
came
back
carrying
my
uncle
second
bunch
of
keys
to
lock
the
doors
and
search
too
for
mine
own
was
growing
dusk
already
and
as
i
thrust
the
key
into
the
lock
the
great
grey
porch
grew
cold
upon
me
like
a
tomb
i
pushed
hard
at
the
key
then
stopped
with
all
my
flesh
freezing
and
half
in
mind
to
fly
for
sirs
the
door
was
locked
already
and
i
drew
the
key
forth
quietly
and
stepped
back
into
the
churchyard
where
the
graves
were
warm
with
sunset
still
and
the
blunt
carven
stones
lengthened
their
homely
shadows
out
and
out
to
everlasting
then
i
plucked
up
heart
seeing
the
footprints
of
that
mighty
masque
along
the
pebbled
path
a
queer
thought
came
into
my
head
that
all
the
world
without
was
but
a
masque
and
i
was
creeping
back
back
from
the
mourner
feast
to
truth
again
yet
i
grew
bold
and
tried
the
southern
door
was
locked
but
held
no
key
on
the
inner
side
to
foil
my
own
and
softly
softly
click
i
turned
it
and
with
heart
sirs
in
my
mouth
pushed
back
the
studded
door
and
entered
in
stepped
straight
out
of
the
world
i
might
have
said
out
of
the
dusk
into
a
night
so
deep
so
dark
i
trembled
like
a
child
and
then
i
was
aware
sirs
of
a
great
sweet
wave
of
incense
all
the
gloom
was
heavy
with
it
as
if
her
papist
household
had
returned
to
pray
for
her
poor
soul
and
my
fear
went
but
either
that
strange
incense
weighed
me
down
or
else
from
being
sorely
a
languor
came
upon
me
and
sitting
there
to
breathe
a
moment
in
a
velvet
stall
i
closed
mine
eyes
a
moment
and
no
more
for
then
i
heard
a
rustling
in
the
nave
and
opened
them
and
very
far
away
as
if
across
the
world
in
rome
herself
i
saw
twelve
tapers
in
the
solemn
east
and
saw
or
thought
i
saw
cowled
figures
kneel
before
them
in
an
and
then
maybe
the
sunset
deepened
in
the
world
of
masques
without
clear
proof
that
i
had
closed
mine
eyes
but
for
a
moment
sirs
i
saw
as
if
across
a
tomb
a
tiny
jewelled
glow
of
crimson
panes
darkening
and
brightening
with
the
west
and
then
then
i
saw
something
more
queen
mary
vault
and
it
was
open
then
i
heard
a
voice
a
strange
deep
broken
voice
whispering
love
in
soft
french
words
that
clasped
and
clung
like
hands
and
then
two
shadows
passed
against
the
west
two
blurs
of
black
against
that
crimson
stain
slowly
o
very
slowly
with
bowed
heads
leaning
together
and
vanished
into
the
dark
beyond
the
catafalque
then
i
heard
him
pray
and
knew
him
for
the
man
that
prayed
to
me
pray
as
a
man
prays
for
his
love
last
breath
and
then
o
sirs
it
caught
me
by
the
throat
and
i
too
dropped
upon
my
knees
and
prayed
for
as
in
answer
to
his
prayer
there
came
a
moan
of
music
a
mighty
shuddering
sound
from
the
great
organ
a
sound
that
rose
and
fell
like
seas
in
anger
very
far
away
and
then
a
peal
of
thunder
and
then
it
seemed
as
if
the
graves
were
giving
up
their
dead
a
great
cowled
host
of
shadows
rose
and
sang
iræ
dies
illâ
solvet
sæclum
in
favilla
teste
david
cum
i
heard
her
sad
sad
little
broken
voice
out
in
the
darkness
and
david
too
his
blood
is
on
the
floors
of
holyrood
to
speak
for
me
then
that
great
swelled
to
a
thunder
again
and
heaven
and
earth
shrivelled
away
and
in
that
huge
slow
hymn
chariots
were
driven
forth
in
flaming
rows
and
terrible
trumpets
blown
from
deep
to
deep
and
then
ah
then
the
heart
of
heaven
was
hushed
and
in
the
hush
it
seemed
an
angel
wept
another
mary
wept
and
gathering
up
all
our
poor
wounded
weary
world
even
as
a
mother
gathers
up
her
babe
soothed
it
against
her
breast
and
rained
her
tears
on
the
pierced
feet
of
god
and
melted
him
to
pity
and
over
his
feet
poured
her
deep
hair
the
music
died
away
the
shadows
knelt
and
then
i
heard
a
rustling
nigh
the
tomb
and
heard
and
heard
or
dreamed
i
heard
farewells
farewells
for
everlasting
deep
farewells
bitter
as
blood
darker
than
any
death
and
at
the
last
as
in
a
kiss
one
breath
one
agony
of
sweetness
like
a
sword
for
sharpness
drawn
along
a
soft
white
throat
and
for
its
terrible
sweetness
like
a
sigh
across
great
waters
very
far
away
and
then
like
doors
like
doors
that
shut
for
everlasting
came
a
clang
and
ringing
echoing
through
the
echo
of
it
one
terrible
cry
that
plucked
my
out
and
on
the
closed
and
silent
tomb
where
there
were
two
one
shuddering
shadow
lay
and
then
i
too
reeled
swooned
and
knew
no
more
sirs
when
i
woke
there
was
a
broad
bright
shaft
of
moonlight
slanting
through
an
eastern
pane
full
on
her
tomb
and
that
black
catafalque
and
on
the
tomb
there
lay
my
bunch
of
keys
i
struggled
to
my
feet
ashamed
of
my
wild
fancies
like
a
man
awakening
from
a
drunken
dream
and
yet
when
i
picked
up
the
keys
although
that
storm
of
terror
had
all
blown
by
and
left
me
calm
i
lifted
up
mine
eyes
to
see
the
scroll
round
the
rich
crest
of
that
dark
canopy
in
my
defence
god
me
defend
the
moon
struck
full
upon
it
and
as
i
turned
and
went
god
help
me
sirs
though
i
were
loyal
enough
to
good
queen
bess
i
could
not
help
but
say
and
yet
methought
it
was
not
i
that
spake
but
some
deep
soul
that
used
me
for
a
mask
a
soul
that
rose
up
in
this
hollow
shell
like
dark
flooding
an
empty
cave
i
could
not
help
but
say
with
my
poor
lips
amen
sirs
is
a
terrible
thing
to
move
in
great
events
since
that
strange
night
i
have
not
been
as
other
men
the
tides
would
rise
in
this
dark
cave
he
tapped
his
skull
deep
tides
i
know
not
whence
and
when
they
rose
my
friends
looked
strangely
upon
me
and
stood
aloof
and
once
my
uncle
said
to
me
indeed
it
troubled
me
strangely
he
said
art
translated
i
could
well
believe
thou
art
two
men
whereof
the
one
a
fool
the
other
a
prophet
or
else
beneath
thy
skin
there
lurks
a
changeling
what
hath
come
to
thee
and
then
sirs
then
well
i
remember
it
was
on
a
summer
eve
and
we
walked
home
between
high
ghostly
hedges
white
with
may
and
uncle
robin
in
his
suit
of
reading
tawny
felt
his
old
heart
swell
with
pride
in
his
great
memories
he
began
chanting
the
pedlar
tune
keeping
the
time
thus
jingle
jingle
slowly
with
his
keys
i
douglas
in
the
moonless
night
oars
on
blue
loch
leven
took
her
hand
a
flake
of
white
slides
the
bolts
of
little
white
hand
like
a
flake
of
snow
when
they
saw
it
his
highland
crew
swung
together
and
murmured
low
douglas
wilt
die
then
too
and
the
pine
trees
whispered
weeping
douglas
tender
and
true
little
white
hand
like
a
tender
moonbeam
soon
shall
you
set
the
broadswords
leaping
it
is
the
queen
the
queen
they
whispered
watching
her
soar
to
the
saddle
anew
there
will
be
trumpets
blown
in
the
mountains
a
mist
of
blood
on
the
heather
and
weeping
weeping
weeping
and
too
dead
for
her
douglas
douglas
tender
and
true
ii
carry
the
queenly
lass
along
she
lies
cold
and
dead
she
whose
laughter
was
a
song
around
with
sheets
of
lead
she
whose
blood
was
wine
of
the
south
her
down
to
a
couch
of
clay
and
a
royal
rose
her
mouth
and
her
body
made
of
may
lift
your
torches
weeping
weeping
light
her
down
to
a
couch
of
clay
they
should
have
left
her
in
her
vineyards
left
her
heart
to
her
land
own
keeping
left
her
white
breast
room
to
breathe
and
left
her
light
foot
free
to
dance

between
the
solemn
pinewoods

the
lovely
lady
sleeping
out
of
the
cold
grey

her
southward
palled
in
purple
weeping
weeping
weeping
weeping
ma
patrie
la
plus
chérie
adieu
plaisant
pays
de
france
well
sirs
that
dark
tide
rose
within
my
brain
i
snatched
his
keys
and
flung
them
over
the
hedge
then
flung
myself
down
on
a
bank
of
ferns
and
wept
and
wept
and
wept
it
puzzled
him
perchance
he
feared
my
mind
was
going
and
yet
o
sirs
if
you
consider
it
rightly
now
with
all
those
ages
knocking
at
his
doors
with
all
that
custom
clamouring
for
his
care
is
it
so
strange
a
should
weep
well
he
was
kind
enough
and
heaped
my
plate
that
night
at
supper
but
i
could
never
dig
my
graves
at
ease
in
peterborough
churchyard
so
i
came
to
london
to
mary
magdalen
and
thus
i
chanced
to
drink
my
ale
one
night
here
in
the
mermaid
inn
was
all
souls
eve
and
on
that
bench
where
master
ford
now
sits
was
master
shakespeare
well
the
lights
burned
low
and
just
like
master
ford
he
leaned
suddenly
forward
he
said
a
most
marvellous
ruby
my
blood
froze
i
stretched
my
hand
out
bare
as
it
was
born
and
he
said
nothing
only
looked
at
me
then
seeing
my
pipe
was
empty
he
bade
me
fill
and
lit
it
for
me
peach
the
astrologer
was
living
then
and
that
same
night
i
went
and
told
him
all
my
trouble
about
this
ring
he
took
my
hand
in
his
and
held
it
thus
then
looked
into
my
face
and
said
this
rhyme
ruby
ring
that
only
three
while
time
and
tide
go
by
shall
see
weds
your
hand
to
and
pride
the
first
shall
lend
the
second
shall
give
you
gold
to
spend
the
third
shall
warn
you
of
your
peach
was
a
rogue
some
say
and
yet
he
spake
most
truly
about
the
first
the
sexton
mused
for
master
shakespeare
though
they
say
in
youth
outside
the
theatres
he
would
hold
your
horse
for
pence
prospered
at
last
bought
a
fine
house
in
stratford
lived
there
like
a
squire
they
say
and
here
here
he
would
sit
for
all
the
world
as
he
were
but
a
poet
god
bless
us
all
and
then
to
think
he
rose
to
be
a
squire
a
deep
one
masters
well
he
lit
my
pipe
why
did
they
bury
such
a
queen
by
night
said
ford
kings
might
have
wept
for
her
did
death
play
epicure
and
glutton
that
so
few
were
bidden
to
such
a
feast
once
on
a
time
i
could
have
wept
myself
to
hear
a
tale
of
beauty
buried
in
the
dark
and
hers
was
loveliness
far
far
beyond
the
common
such
beauty
should
be
marble
to
the
touch
of
time
and
clad
in
purple
to
amaze
the
moth
but
she
was
kind
and
soft
and
fair
a
woman
and
so
she
died
but
why
the
dark
sir
they
gave
out
the
coffin
was
too
heavy
for
gentlemen
to
bear
for
kings
to
bear
ford
flashed
at
him
the
sexton
shook
his
head
nay
gentlemen
to
bear
but
the
true
cause
ah
sir
is
unbelievable
even
to
me
a
sexton
for
a
queen
so
fair
of
face
and
all
her
beds
even
as
the
pedlar
said
breathing
arabia
sirs
her
walls
all
hung
with
woven
purple
wonders
and
great
tales
of
amorous
gods
and
mighty
mirrors
too
imaging
her
own
softness
night
and
dawn
when
through
her
sumptuous
hair
she
drew
the
combs
and
like
one
great
white
half
her
breast
shone
through
it
firm
as
ivory
ay
said
lodge
murmuring
his
own
rich
music
under
breath
her
neck
did
all
the
graces
throng
and
lay
such
baits
as
did
entangle
well
sir
the
weather
being
hot
they
feared
she
would
not
hold
the
burying
in
some
sort
ford
answered
slowly
if
your
tale
be
true
she
did
not
hold
it
many
a
knightly
crest
will
bend
yet
the
ghost
of
that
small
hand
there
was
a
hush
broken
by
ben
at
last
who
turned
to
ford
how
now
my
golden
lad
the
astrologer
dead
hand
is
on
thy
purse
ford
laughed
grimly
and
flung
an
angel
down
well
cause
or
consequence
rhyme
or
no
rhyme
there
is
thy
gold
i
will
not
break
the
spell
or
thou
mayst
live
to
bury
us
one
and
all
and
if
i
live
so
long
the
old
man
replied
lighting
his
lanthorn
you
may
trust
me
sirs
mine
inn
is
quiet
and
i
can
find
you
beds
where
queens
might
sleep
all
night
and
never
move
sirs
and
god
bless
you
one
and
all
he
shouldered
pick
and
spade
i
opened
the
door
the
snow
blew
in
and
as
he
shuffled
out
there
in
the
strait
dark
passage
i
could
swear
i
saw
a
spark
of
red
upon
his
hand
like
a
great
smouldering
ruby
i
gasped
he
stopped
he
peered
at
me
twice
in
a
night
he
said
nothing
i
answered
only
the
he
shook
his
head
i
tell
you
something
more
there
nothing
nothing
now
in
life
or
death
that
frightens
me
ah
things
used
to
frighten
me
but
never
now
i
thought
i
had
ten
years
but
if
the
warning
comes
and
says
fool
this
night
why
then
i
ready
i
watched
him
go
with
glimmering
lanthorn
up
the
narrow
street
like
one
that
walked
upon
the
clouds
through
snow
that
seemed
to
mix
the
city
with
the
skies
on
christmas
eve
we
heard
that
he
was
dead
viii
flos
mercatorum
flos
mercatorum
on
that
night
of
nights
we
drew
from
out
our
mermaid
cellarage
all
the
old
glory
of
london
in
one
cask
of
magic
vintage
never
a
city
on
earth

held
for
ben
the
colours
of
old
london
and
that
night
we
staved
them
like
a
wine
and
drank
drank
deep
was
master
heywood
whom
the
mermaid
inn
had
dubbed
our
london
laureate
hauled
the
cask
out
of
its
ancient
harbourage
ben
he
cried
bustling
into
the
room
with
dekker
and
brome
the
prentices
are
up
ben
raised
his
head
out
of
the
where
he
drowsed
and
listened
reaching
slowly
for
his
pipe
of
the
bow
all
along
the
cheape
there
came
a
shout
that
swelled
into
a
roar
what
will
they
storm
the
mermaid
heywood
laughed
they
are
turning
into
bread
street
down
they
came
we
heard
them
hooting
round
the
poor
old
clerk
clubs
clubs
the
rogue
would
have
us
work
all
night
he
rang
ten
minutes
late
fifteen
by
paul
and
over
the
hubbub
rose
like
a
thin
bell
the
clerk
entreaty
now
good
boys
good
boys
children
of
cheape
be
still
i
do
beseech
you
i
took
some
forty
winks
but
then
a
roar
of
wrathful
laughter
drowned
him
forty
winks
remember
black
we
make
you
wink
there
was
a
scuffle
and
into
the
tavern
rushed
gregory
clopton
clerk
of
the
bow
bell
a
tall
thin
man
with
yellow
hair
and
blazing
eyes
hide
me
he
clamoured
quick
these
picaroons
will
murder
me
i
closed
the
thick
oak
doors
against
the
coloured
storm
of
prentices
in
red
and
green
and
ray
saffron
and
reading
tawny
twenty
clubs
drubbed
on
the
panels
as
i
barred
them
out
and
even
our
walls
and
shutters
could
not
drown
their
song
that
like
a
mocking
peal
of
bells
under
our
windows
made
all
bread
street
ring
of
the
bow
bell
with
the
yellow
locks
for
thy
late
ringing
thy
head
shall
have
knocks
then
heywood
seeing
the
clerk
was
all
went
to
an
upper
casement
that
the
whole
of
bread
street
heywood
knew
their
ways
and
parleyed
with
them
till
their
anger
turned
to
shouts
of
merriment
then
like
one
deep
bell
his
voice
rang
out
in
answer
to
their
peal
of
cheape
hold
you
all
still
you
shall
have
bow
bell
rung
at
your
will
loudly
they
cheered
him
courteously
he
bowed
then
firmly
shut
the
window
and
ere
i
filled
his
cup
with
sack
again
the
crowd
had
gone
my
clochard
sirs
is
warm
quavered
the
clerk
i
do
confess
i
took
some
forty
winks
they
are
good
lads
our
prentices
of
cheape
but
hasty
wine
said
ben
he
filled
a
cup
and
thrust
it
into
gregory
trembling
hands

a
task
said
dekker
a
great
task

among
the
gods

lord

pulse
of
london

days
of
whittington

good
old
days
growled
ben
both
good
and
bad
were
measured
by
my
bell
the
clerk
replied
and
while
he
spoke
warmed
by
the
wine
his
voice
mellowed
and
floated
up
and
down
the
scale
as
if
the
music
of
the
london
bells
lingered
upon
his
tongue
i
know
them
all
and
love
them
all
the
voices
of
the
bells
flos
mercatorum
that
the
bell
of

wrote
it
down

the
tale

heart

turn

out
said
heywood
gregory
smiled
and
cleared
his
throat
you
must
imagine
sirs
the
clerk
sitting
on
high
among
the
clouds
with
london
spread
beneath
him
like
a
map
under
his
tower
a
flock
of
prentices
calling
like
bells
of
little
size
or
weight
but
bells
no
less
ask
that
the
bell
of
bow
shall
tell
the
tale
of
richard
whittington
as
thus
then
gregory
clopton
mellowing
all
the
chiming
vowels
and
dwelling
on
every
tone
in
rhythm
or
rhyme
that
helped
to
swell
the
peal
or
keep
the
ringing
measure
beat
for
beat

this
legend
of
the
london

then
he
looked
to
northward
for
the
tall
ships
of
bristol
far
away
and
cold
as
death
he
saw
the
severn
shine
then
he
looked
to
eastward
and
he
saw
a
string
of
colours
trickling
through
the
grey
hills
like
elfin
drops
of
wine
down
along
the
mendip
dale
the
chapmen
and
their
horses
far
away
and
carrying
each
its
little
coloured
load
winding
like
a
with
pack
and
corded
bundle
trickled
like
a
crimson
thread
along
the
silver
road
quick
he
ran
to
meet
them
stick
and
bundle
on
his
shoulder
over
by
cold
ashton
he
met
them
trampling
down
white
shaggy
horses
with
their
packs
of
purple
spicery
crimson
kegs
of
malmsey
and
the
silks
of
london
town
when
the
chapmen
asked
of
him
the
to
dorset
blithely
he
showed
them
and
he
led
them
on
their
way
led
them
through
the
fern
with
their
bales
of
breathing
araby
led
them
to
a
that
saved
them
half
a
day
merrily
shook
the
silver
bells
that
hung
the
broidered
chiming
to
his
hand
as
he
led
them
through
the
fern
down
to
deep
dorset
and
the
wooded
isle
of
purbeck
then
by
little
kimmeridge
they
led
him
turn
for
turn
down
by
little
kimmeridge
and
up
by
hampshire
round
by
sussex
violets
and
of
kent
singing
songs
of
london
telling
tales
of
london
all
the
way
to
london
with
packs
of
wool
they
went
london
was
london
then
a
clean
clear
moat
girdled
her
walls
that
measured
round
about
three
miles
or
less
she
is
big
and
dirty
now
said
dekker
call
it
a
silver
moat
growled
ben
that
the
new
poetry
call
it
crystal
lad
but
till
you
kiss
the
beast
you
never
find
your
fairy
prince
why
all
those
crowded
streets
flung
all
their
filth
their
refuse
rags
and
bones
dead
cats
and
dogs
into
your
clean
clear
moat
and
made
it
sluggish
as
old
acheron
fevers
and
plagues
death
in
a
thousand
shapes
crawled
out
of
it
london
was
dirty
lad
and
till
you
kiss
that
fact
you
never
see
the
glory
of
this
old
jerusalem
ay
is
the
fogs
that
make
the
sunset
red
answered
tom
heywood
london
is
earthy
coarse
grimy
and
grand
you
must
make
dirt
the
ground
or
lose
the
colours
of

clopton
tale
ring
on
and
nothing
loth
the
clerk
resumed
bravely
swelled
his
heart
to
see
the
moat
of
london
glittering
round
her
mighty
wall
they
told
him
two
miles
long
then
he
gasped
as
echoing
in
by
grim
black
aldgate
suddenly
their
shaggy
nags
were
nodding
through
a
throng
prentices
in
red
and
ray
marchaunts
in
their
saffron
aldermen
in
violets
and
minstrels
in
white
clerks
in
homely
hoods
of
budge
and
wives
with
crimson
wimples
thronging
as
to
welcome
him
that
happy
summer
night
back
they
cried
and
clear
the
way
and
caught
the
ringing
wait
the
watch
is
going
by
this
vigil
of
st
john
merrily
laughed
the
chapmen
then
reining
their
great
white
horses
back
when
the
pageant
passes
lad
we
up
and
follow
on
there
as
thick
the
crowd
surged
beneath
the
blossomed
lifting
up
to
whittington
a
fair
face
afraid
swept
against
his
horse
by
a
billow
of
madcap
prentices
hard
against
the
stirrup
breathed
a
maid
swift
he
drew
her
up
and
up
and
throned
her
there
before
him
high
above
the
throng
with
her
laughing
april
eyes
like
a
queen
of
faërie
on
the
great
hey
laughed
the
chapmen
the

wins
the
prize
whittington
whittington
the
world
is
all
before
you
blithely
rang
the
bells
and
the
steeples
rocked
and
reeled
then
he
saw
her
eyes
grow
wide
and
all
along
by
leaden
hall
drums
rolled
earth
shook
and
shattering
trumpets
pealed
like
a
marching
sunset
there
from
leaden
hall
to
aldgate
flared
the
crimson
cressets
o
her
brows
were
haloed
then
then
the
stirring
steeds
went
by
with
all
their
mounted
trumpeters
then
in
ringing
harness
a
thousand
marching
men
marching
marching
his
heart
and
all
the
halberdiers
and
his
pulses
throbbing
with
the
throbbing
of
the
drums
marching
marching
his
blood
and
all
the
burganets
look
she
cried
o
look
she
cried
and
now
the
morrice
comes
dancing
dancing
her
eyes
and
all
the
lincoln
green
robin
hood
and
friar
tuck
dancing
through
the
town
where
is
marian
laughingly
she
turned
to
richard
whittington
here
he
said
and
pointed
to
her
own
green
gown
dancing
dancing
her
heart
and
all
the
then
there
burst
a
mighty
shout
from
thrice
a
thousand
throats
then
with
all
their
bows
bent
and
sheaves
of
peacock
arrows
marched
the
tall
archers
in
their
white
silk
coats
white
silk
coats
with
the
crest
of
london
city
crimson
on
the
shoulder
a
sign
for
all
to
read
marching

and
then
the
sworded
henchmen
then
william
walworth
on
his
great
stirring
steed
ay
the
walworth
he
whose
nets
of
silk
drew
the
silver
from
the
tide
he
who
saved
the
king
when
the
king
was
but
a
prentice
lord
mayor
of
london
with
his
sword
at
his
side
burned
with
magic
changes
his
blood
and
all
the
pageantry
burned
with
deep
the
wonder
in
her
eyes
mercatorum
was
the
of
paphos
reddening
all
the
city
for
the
prentice
and
his
prize
all
the
book
of
london
the
pages
of
adventure
passed
before
the
prentice
on
that
vigil
of
john
then
the
chapmen
shook
their
reins
we
ride
behind
the
revelry
round
again
to
cornhill
up
and
follow
on
riding
on
his
above
the
shouting
multitude
there
she
turned
and
smiled
at
him
and
thanked
him
for
his
grace
let
me
down
by
rose
and
like
a
wave
of
twilight
while
she
spoke
her
shadowy
hair
touched
his
tingling
face
when
they
came
to
rose
beneath
the
blossomed
light
along
his
arm
she
lay
a
moment
leaping
down
then
she
waved
farewell
to
him
and
down
the
lane
he
watched
her
flitting
through
the
darkness
in
her
gay
green
gown
all
along
the
cheape
as
he
rode
among
the
chapmen
round
by
to
the
coloured
like
the
sunset
prentices
and
maidens
danced
for
red
roses
on
the
vigil
of
john
over
them
were
jewelled
lamps
in
great
black
galleries
garlanded
with
beauty
and
burning
all
the
night
all
the
doors
were
shadowy
with
orpin
and
john
wort
long
fennel
green
birch
and
lilies
of
delight
he
should
have
slept
here
at
the
mermaid
inn
said
heywood
as
the
chanter
paused
for
breath
what
has
our
mermaid
sung
so
long
cried
ben
her
beams
are
black
enough
there
was
an
inn
said
tom
that
bore
the
name
and
through
its
heart
there
flowed
the
right
old
purple
i
like
to
think
it
was
the
same
where
lydgate
took
his
ease
after
his
hood
was
stolen
and
gower
perchance
and
though
he
loved
the
for
i
like
to
think
the
father
of
us
all
the
old
adam
of
english
minstrelsy
caroused
here
in
the
mermaid
tavern
i
like
to
think
jolly
dan
chaucer
with
his
kind
shrewd
face
fresh
as
an
apple
above
his
gown
one
plump
hand
sporting
with
his
golden
chain
looked
out
from
that
old
casement
over
the
sign
and
saw
the
pageant
and
the
shaggy
nags
with
whittington
and
his
maid
go
by
o
very
like
said
clopton
for
the
bells
left
not
a
head
indoors
that
night
he
drank
a
draught
of
malmsey
and
thus
renewed
his
tale
mourned
the
bell
of
all
hallowes
there
was
he
an
orphan
o
a
little
lad
alone
rubbing
down
the
great
white
horses
for
a
supper
true
boomed
the
bow
bell
his
hands
were
his
own
where
did
he
sleep
on
a
plump
white
open
to
the
moon
on
that
vigil
of
john
sheltered
from
the
dew
where
the
gallery
frowned
above
the
yard
of
the
early
in
the
morning
clanged
the
bell
of
martin
early
in
the
morning
with
a
groat
in
his
hand
mournfully
he
parted
with
the
chapmen
shouldered
his
bundle
and
walked
into
the
walked
into
the
and
back
again
to
staring
at
the
wizardry
of
every
painted
sign
dazed
with
the
steeples
and
the
rich
heraldic
cornices
drinking
in
the
colours
of
the
cheape
like
wine
all
about
the
booths
now
the
prentices
fluted
like
a
flock
of
birds
along
a
summer
lane
green
linnets
red
caps
and
gay
gold
finches
d
lack
and
what
d
lack
and
what
d
lack
again
buy
my
dainty
doublets
cut
on
double
taffetas
buy
my
paris
thread
they
cried
and
caught
him
by
the
hand
laces
for
your
and
lawns
to
make
her
love
you
cambric
for
her
wimple
o
the
finest
in
the
land
ah
but
he
was
hungry
weary
knocking
at
the
doors
of
the
armourers
that
day
d
lack
they
asked
of
him
but
no
man
lacked
a
prentice
when
he
told
them
what
he
lacked
they
frowned
and
turned
away
hard
was
his
bed
that
night
beneath
a
cruel
archway
down
among
the
hulks
with
his
heart
growing
cold
london
is
a
rare
town
but
o
the
streets
of
london
red
though
their
flints
be
they
are
not
red
with
gold
pale
in
the
dawn
ere
he
marched
on
his
adventure
starving
for
a
crust
did
he
kneel
again
then
upon
the
fourth
night
he
cried
o
like
a
wounded
bird
let
me
die
if
die
i
must
in
rose
like
a
little
wounded
bird
he
trailed
through
the
darkness
laid
him
on
a
and
then
o
like
a
breath
pitifully
blowing
out
his
life
little
rushlight
came
a
gush
of
blackness
a
swoon
deep
as
death
then
he
heard
a
rough
voice
then
he
saw
a
lanthorn
then
he
saw
a
bearded
face
and
blindly
wondered
whose
then
a
marchaunt
portly
legs
with
great
bigger
than
paul
he
thought
embroidered
on
his
shoes
alice
roared
the
voice
and
then
o
like
a
lilied
angel
leaning
from
the
lighted
door
a
fair
face
afraid
leaning
over
rose
o
leaning
out
of
paradise
drooped
the
sudden
glory
of
his
maid
o
mellow
be
thy
malmsey
grunted
ben
filling
the
clerk
another
cup
the
peal
quoth
clopton
is
not
ended
but
the
pause
in
ringing
chimes
to
a
deep
inward
ear
and
tells
its
own
deep
tale
silence
and
sound
darkness
and
light
mourning
and
mirth
no
tale
no
painting
and
no
music
nay
no
world
if
god
should
cut
their
fruitful
a
shallow
sort
would
fain
deny
a
hell
sirs
to
this
boundless
universe
to
such
i
say
hell
no
paradise
others
would
fain
deny
the
topless
towers
of
heaven
and
make
this
earth
a
hell
indeed
to
such
i
say
unplumbed
gulfs
of
grief
are
only
theirs
for
whom
the
blissful
chimes
ring
from
those
unseen
heights
this
earth
hangs
like
a
belfry
where
the
ringers
grasp
their
ropes
in
darkness
each
in
his
own
place
each
knowing
by
the
tune
in
his
own
heart
never
by
sight
when
he
must
toss
through
heaven
the
tone
of
his
own
bell
those
bounded
souls
have
never
heard
our
chimes
why
sirs
myself
simply
by
running
up
and
down
the
scale
descend
to
hell
or
soar
to
heaven
my
bells
height
above
height
deep
below
deep
respond
their
scale
is
infinite
dare
i
for
one
breath
dream
that
one
note
hath
crowned
and
ended
all
sudden
i
hear
far
far
above
those
clouds
like
laughing
angels
peal
on
golden
peal
innumerable
as
drops
of
april
rain
yet
every
note
distinct
round
as
a
pearl
and
perfect
in
its
place
a
chime
of
law
whose
pure
and
boundless
mere
arithmetic
climbs
with
my
soul
to
god
ben
looked
at
him
gently
resume
old
moralist
he
said
on
to
thy
the
are
wiser
than
they
know
sirs
all
our
woes
lead
on
to
those
celestial
the
world
and
the
pure
city
of
god
peals
for
the
wedding
of
our
joy
and
pain
this
was
well
seen
of
richard
whittington
for
only
he
that
finds
the
london
streets
paved
with
red
flints
at
last
shall
find
them
paved
like
to
the
perfect
city
with
pure
gold
ye
know
the
world
what
was
a
london
waif
to
hugh
fitzwarren
daughter
he
was
fed
and
harboured
and
the
cook
declared
she
lacked
a
scullion
so
in
hugh
fitzwarren
house
he
turned
the
jack
and
scoured
the
how
could
he
hope
for
more
this
marchaunt
house
was
builded
like
a
great
inn
square
with
a
galleried
courtyard
such
as
now
the
players
use
its
rooms
were
rich
and
dim
with
coloured
panes
and
massy
beams
its
ancient
eaves
jutted
rose
darkly
like
eyebrows
of
a
mage
asleep
its
oaken
stair
coiled
upward
through
a
dusk
heavy
with
fume
of
scented
woods
that
burned
to
keep
the
plague
away
a
gloom
to
embalm
a
pharaoh
but
to
dull
the
cheek
and
eye
of
country
lads
like
whittington
he
pined
for
wind
and
sunlight
yet
he
plied
his
task
patient
as
in
old
tales
of
the
young
knight
would
unhelm
his
golden
locks
and
play
the
scullion
so
that
he
might
watch
his
lady
eyes
unknown
and
oftener
hear
her
laughter
rippling
overhead
her
green
gown
like
the
breath
of
eden
boughs
rustling
nigh
him
and
all
day
long
he
found
sunshine
enough
in
this
but
when
at
night
he
crept
into
the
low
dark
vaulted
den
the
cobwebbed
cellar
where
the
cook
had
strewn
the
scullion
bed
of
straw
and
none
too
thick
lest
he
should
sleep
too
long
he
choked
for
breath
and
like
an
old
man
hoarding
up
his
life
fostered
his
glimmering
rushlight
as
he
sate
bolt
upright
while
a
horrible
scurry
heaved
his
rustling
bed
and
bright
eyes
peered
at
him
from
the
crannies
of
the
wall
then
darkness
whelmed
him
and
perchance
he
slept
only
to
fight
with
nightmares
and
to
fly
down
endless
tunnels
in
a
ghastly
dream
hunted
by
horrible
human
souls
that
took
the
shape
of
monstrous
rats
great
chattering
snouts
vile
shapes
of
shadowy
cunning
and
grey
greed
that
gnaw
through
beams
and
undermine
tall
towns
and
carry
the
seeds
of
plague
and
ruin
and
death
under
the
careless
homes
of
sleeping
men
thus
in
the
darkness
did
he
wage
a
war
with
all
the
powers
of
darkness
the
light
do
break
upon
me
by
the
grace
of
god
so
did
he
vow
then
will
i
remember
then
then
will
i
remember
ay
and
help
to
build
that
lovelier
city
which
is
paved
for
rich
and
poor
alike
with
purest
gold
ah
sirs
he
kept
his
vow
ye
will
not
smile
if
at
the
first
the
best
that
he
could
do
was
with
his
first
poor
to
buy
a
cat
and
bring
her
home
under
his
coat
by
stealth
or
else
that
termagant
the
cook
had
drowned
it
in
the
nor
deemed
the
water
worse
to
drink
so
did
he
quell
first
his
own
plague
but
bettered
others
too
now
in
those
days
marchaunt
adventurers
shared
with
their
prentices
the
happy
chance
of
each
new
venture
each
might
have
his
stake
little
or
great
upon
the
glowing
tides
of
high
romance
that
washed
the
wharfs
of
thames
and
every
lad
in
london
had
his
groat
or
splendid
shilling
on
some
fair
ship
at
sea
so
on
an
april
eve
fitzwarren
called
his
prentices
together
for
ere
long
the
his
tall
new
ship
must
sail
beyond
the
world
to
gather
gorgeous
webs
from
eastern
looms
great
miracles
of
silk
dipt
in
the
dawn
by
wizard
hands
of
ind
or
if
they
chanced
upon
that
fabled
coast
where
sydon
river
of
jewels
like
a
snake
slides
down
the
gorge
its
coils
of
crimson
fire
perchance
a
richer
cargo
rubies
pearls
or
gold
bars
from
the
gates
of
paradise
and
many
a
moon
at
least
a
faërie
foam
would
lap
blackfriars
wharf
where
london
lads
gazed
in
the
sunset
down
that
misty
reach
for
old
black
battered
hulks
and
tattered
sails
bringing
their
dreams
home
from
the
uncharted
sea
and
one
flung
down
a
groat
he
had
no
more
one
staked
a
shilling
one
a
good
french
crown
and
one
an
angel
o
enough
to
reach
cathay
and
not
a
lad
but
bought
his
pennyworth
of
wonder
so
they
thought
till
all
at
once
fitzwarren
daughter
cried
you
have
forgot
poor
whittington
snails
laughed
the
rosy
marchaunt
that
true
fetch
whittington
the
lad
must
stake
his
groat
bring
us
luck
whittington
down
the
dark
stair
like
a
bird
fluttered
sweet
alice
richard
quick
quick
with
your
groat
now
for
the
groat
cried
whittington
standing
there
aghast
with
brown
bare
arms
still
coloured
by
the
sun
among
his
pots
and
pans
should
i
find
a
groat
i
staked
my
last
groat
in
a
cat
have
you
nothing
nothing
but
a
cat
then
stake
the
cat
she
said
and
the
quick
fire
that
in
a
woman
mind
the
thought
of
man
lit
her
grey
eyes
whittington
laughed
and
opened
the
out
sailed
his
wealth
waving
its
tail
purring
and
rubbing
its
head
now
on
his
boots
now
on
the
dainty
shoe
of
alice
who
straightway
deaf
to
his
laughing
prayers
caught
up
the
cat
whispered
it
hugged
it
close
against
its
grey
fur
leaned
her
glowing
cheek
and
carried
it
off
in
triumph
rose
echoed
with
laughter
as
with
amber
eyes
blinking
the
grey
cat
in
a
seaman
arms
went
to
the
wharf
but
we
need
a
cat
the
captain
said
so
when
the
painted
ship
sailed
through
a
golden
sunrise
down
the
thames
a
grey
tail
waved
upon
the
misty
poop
and
whittington
had
his
venture
on
the
seas
it
was
a
nine
days
jest
and
soon
forgot
but
all
that
year
ah
sirs
ye
know
the
world
for
all
the
foolish
boasting
of
the
proud
looks
not
beneath
the
coat
of
taunton
serge
for
gules
and
azure
a
prince
that
comes
in
rags
to
clean
your
shoes
and
out
of
his
own
pride
waits
for
the
world
to
paint
his
shield
again
must
wait
for
ever
and
a
day
the
world
is
a
great
hypocrite
hypocrite
most
of
all
when
thus
it
boasts
its
purple
pride
of
race
then
with
eyes
blind
to
all
but
pride
of
place
tramples
the
scullion
heraldry
underfoot
nay
never
sees
it
never
dreams
of
it
content
to
know
that
here
and
now
his
coat
is
greasy
so
did
whittington
find
at
last
such
nearness
was
most
distant
that
to
see
her
talk
with
her
serve
her
thus
was
but
to
lose
true
sight
true
hearing
he
must
save
his
life
by
losing
it
forsake
to
win
his
love
go
out
into
the
world
to
bring
her
home
it
was
but
labour
lost
to
clean
the
shoes
and
turn
the
jack
and
scour
the
for
every
scolding
blown
about
her
ears
the
cook
great
ladle
fell
upon
the
head
of
whittington
who
beneath
her
rule
became
the
scullery
general
scapegoat
it
was
he
that
burned
the
drank
the
hippocras
dinted
the
silver
beaker
many
a
month
he
chafed
till
his
resolve
took
sudden
shape
and
out
of
the
dark
house
at
the
peep
of
day
shouldering
bundle
and
stick
again
he
stole
to
seek
his
freedom
and
to
shake
the
dust
of
london
from
his
shoes
you
know
the
stone
on
highgate
where
he
sate
awhile
to
rest
with
aching
heart
and
thought
shall
not
see
her
face
again
there
as
the
coloured
dawn
over
the
sleeping
city
slowly
bloomed
a
small
black
battered
ship
with
tattered
sails
blurring
the
burnished
glamour
of
the
thames
crept
to
a
wharf
then
all
at
once
the
london
bells
rang
out
a
welcome
home
and
over
them
all
tossing
the
tenor
on
high
the
bell
of
bow
a
sun
among
the
stars
flooded
the
morning
air
with
this
refrain
again
whittington
turn
again
whittington
thy
ship
hath
come
home
trailing
from
her
the
crimson
of
the
sunrise
dragging
all
the
glory
of
the
sunset
thro
the
foam
turn
again
whittington
turn
again
whittington
lord
mayor
of
london
turn
again
whittington
when
thy
hope
was
darkest
far
beyond
the
a
ship
sailed
for
thee
o
when
thy
faith
was
blindest
even
then
thy
sails
were
set
beyond
the
so
he
heard
and
heeded
us
and
turned
again
to
london
stick
and
bundle
on
his
back
he
turned
to
rose
hardly
hearing
as
he
went
the
chatter
of
the
prentices
d
lack
and
what
d
lack
and
what
d
lack
again
back
into
the
scullery
before
the
cook
had
missed
him
early
in
the
morning
his
labours
he
began
once
again
to
clean
the
shoes
and
clatter
with
the
once
again
to
scrub
the
jack
and
scour
the
all
the
bells
of
london
were
pealing
as
he
laboured
wildly
beat
his
heart
and
his
blood
began
to
race
then
there
came
a
light
step
and
suddenly
beside
him
stood
his
lady
alice
with
a
light
upon
her
face
she
said
quick
she
said
want
you
richard
whittington
she
said
and
while
she
spoke
her
lighted
eyes
betrayed
all
that
she
had
hidden
long
and
all
she
still
would
hide
from
him
so
he
turned
and
followed
her
his
maid
there
in
a
broad
dark
room
rich
with
black
carvings
and
great
gleaming
cups
of
silver
sirs
and
massy
halpace
built
half
over
rose
fitzwarren
sat
and
at
his
side
o
like
an
old
romance
that
suddenly
comes
true
and
fills
the
world
with
april
colours
two
bronzed
seamen
stood
tattered
and
scarred
and
stained
with
sun
and
brine
hugh
fitzwarren
cried
holding
both
hands
out
to
the
boy
prentice
wins
the
prize
why
whittington
thy
cat
hath
caught
the
biggest
mouse
of
all
and
on
to
the
table
tilting
a
heavy
sack
one
of
the
seamen
poured
a
glittering
stream
of
rubies
emeralds
opals
amethysts
that
turned
the
room
to
an
aladdin
cave
or
magic
goblet
brimmed
with
dusky
wine
where
clustering
bubbles
clung
and
sparkled
in
the
halls
of
prester
john
that
said
hugh
fitzwarren
the
price
paid
for
your
cat
in
barbary
by
a
king
whose
house
was
rich
in
gems
but
sorely
plagued
with
rats
and
mice
gather
it
up
my
lad
and
praise
your
master
for
his
honesty
for
though
my
cargo
prospered
yours
outshines
the
best
of
it
take
it
my
lad
and
go
you
a
rich
man
and
if
you
use
it
well
riches
will
make
you
richer
and
the
world
will
prosper
in
your
own
prosperity
the
miser
like
the
cold
and
barren
moon
shines
with
a
fruitless
light
the
spendthrift
fool
flits
like
a
over
quags
and
fens
but
he
that
wisely
rich
gathers
his
gold
into
a
fruitful
and
unwasting
sun
that
spends
its
glory
on
a
thousand
fields
and
blesses
all
the
world
take
it
and
go
blankly
as
in
a
dream
whittington
stared
should
i
take
it
sir
the
ship
was
yours
and
the
ship
was
mine
but
in
that
ship
your
stake
was
richer
than
we
knew
is
yours
answered
whittington
this
wealth
be
mine
who
but
an
hour
ago
was
all
so
poor
i
know
one
way
to
make
me
richer
still
he
gathered
up
the
glittering
sack
of
gems
turned
to
the
halpace
where
his
maid
stood
in
the
glory
of
the
coloured
panes
he
thrust
the
splendid
load
into
her
arms
muttering
it
lady
let
me
be
poor
but
rich
at
least
in
that
you
not
despise
the
waif
you
saved
you
whittington
no
not
in
the
sight
of
god
but
i
grow
tired
of
waiting
for
the
judgment
day
i
am
but
a
man
i
am
a
scullion
now
but
i
would
like
only
for
half
an
hour
to
stand
upright
and
say
i
am
a
king
take
it
and
as
they
stood
a
little
apart
their
eyes
were
married
in
one
swift
level
look
silent
but
all
that
souls
could
say
was
said
and
know
a
way
said
the
bell
of
martin
it
and
be
quick
laughed
the
prentices
below
shall
marry
her
marry
her
marry
her
peal
for
a
wedding
said
the
big
bell
of
bow
he
shall
take
a
kingdom
up
and
cast
it
on
the
sea
again
he
shall
have
his
caravels
to
traffic
for
him
now
he
shall
see
his
royal
sails
rolling
up
from
araby
and
the
crest
a
golden
at
the
prow
whittington
whittington
the
world
is
all
a
fairy
tale
even
so
we
sang
for
but
o
the
tale
is
true
whittington
he
married
her
and
on
his
merry
o
we
sang
we
sang
for
him
like
lavrocks
in
the
blue
far
away
from
london
these
happy
prentice
lovers
wandered
through
the
fern
to
his
western
home
again
down
by
deep
dorset
to
the
wooded
isle
of
purbeck
round
to
little
kimmeridge
by
many
a
lover
lane
there
did
they
abide
as
in
a
hidden
deep
in
happy
woods
until
the
bells
of
duty
rang
then
they
rode
the
way
he
went
a
barefoot
boy
to
london
round
by
hampshire
but
as
they
rode
he
sang
in
dorset
is
the
happiest
of
places
all
the
little
homesteads
are
thatched
with
beauty
there
all
the
old
ploughmen
there
have
happy
smiling
faces
christmas
roses
in
their
cheeks
and
crowns
of
silver
hair
blue
as
are
the
eggs
in
the
nest
of
the
gleam
the
little
rooms
in
the
homestead
that
i
know
death
i
think
has
lost
the
way
to
kimmeridge

never
knew
it

it

may
not
see
you
more

the
years
to

will
i
remember
the
little
happy
homestead
hidden
in
that
paradise
where
god
was
good
to
so
they
turned
to
london
and
with
mind
and
soul
he
laboured
for
the
mighty
years
to
be
fashioning
for
profit
to
the
years
that
should
forget
him
this
our
sacred
city
that
must
shine
upon
the
sea
london
was
a
city
when

marchaunts
loved
their
merchandise

of
eastern
magic

empurpled
wharf
and

london
was
mighty
when
her
booths
were
a
loaded

the
colours
of
the

there
in
all
their
glory
with
the

on
their

out
of

might
be
seen
walking
to

gallantly
they
jetted
it
in
scarlet

in

the
sacred
vision
of
a
city
flashing
like
the
heart
of
heaven
its
messages
afar
trafficking
as
god
himself
through
all
his
interchanging
worlds
holding
up
the
scales
of

weighing
star

lifting
out
of
chaos
the
shining
towers

a
sacred
city
and
a
city
built
of

was
the
city
that
he
saw
and
by
that
light
quoth

did
he
keep
his
promise

was
rich

in
his
will

wrote
those
words
which

be
blazed
with
gold
in

and
mightier
than
the
first
billowing
past
the
newly
painted
doors
of
whittington
palace
so
men
called
his
house
in
hart
street
fifteen
yards
from
old
mark
lane
thousand
burganets
and
halberdiers
a
thousand
archers
in
their
white
silk
coats
a
thousand
mounted
men
in
ringing
mail
a
thousand
sworded
henchmen
then
his
guild
advancing
on
their
splendid
bannerols
the
virgin
glorious
in
gold
and
then
on
his
great
stirring
steed
whittington
on
that
night
he
made
a
feast
for
london
and
the
king
his
feasting
hall
gleamed
like
the
magic
cave
that
prester
john
wrought
out
of
one
huge
opal
east
and
west
lavished
their
wealth
on
that
great
citizen
who
when
the
king
from
agincourt
returned
victorious
but
with
empty
coffers
lent
three
times
the
ransom
of
an
emperor
to
fill
them
on
the
royal
bond
and
said
when
the
king
questioned
him
of
how
and
whence
am
the
steward
of
your
city
sire
there
is
a
sea
and
who
shall
drain
it
dry
over
the
roasted
swans
and
peacock
pies
the
minstrels
in
the
great
black
gallery
tuned
all
hearts
to
mirth
until
it
seemed
their
cups
were
brimmed
with
dawn
and
sunset
and
they
drank
the
wine
of
gods
lord
of
a
hundred
ships
under
the
feet
of
england
whittington
flung
the
purple
of
the
seas
and
when
the
queen
catharine
wondered
at
the
costly
woods
that
burned
upon
his
hearth
the
marchaunt
rose
he
drew
the
great
sealed
parchments
from
his
breast
the
bonds
the
king
had
given
him
on
his
loans
loans
that
might
drain
the
mediterranean
dry
call
us
hucksters
madam
we
that
love
our
city
and
into
the
heart
of
the
fire
he
tossed
the
bonds
of
sixty
thousand
pounds
fire
burns
low
said
richard
whittington
then
overhead
the
minstrels
plucked
their
strings
and
over
the
clash
of
rose
a
song
that
made
the
old
timbers
of
their
shake
as
a
galleon
shakes
in
a
gale
of
wind
when
she
rolls
glorying
through

what
need
to

how
whittington
remembered
night
and
morning
as
he
knelt
in
those
old
days
o
like
two
children
still
whittington
and
his
alice
bowed
their
heads
together
praying
from
such
simple
hearts
o
never
doubt
it
though
the
whole
world
doubt
the
god
that
made
it
came
the
steadfast
strength
of
england
all
that
once
was
her
strong
soul
the
soul
that
laughed
and
shook
away
defeat
as
her
strong
cliffs
hurl
back
the
streaming
seas
sirs
in
his
old
age
whittington
returned
and
stood
with
alice
by
the
silent
tomb
in
little
pauntley
church
there
to
his
arms
the
gules
and
azure
and
the
lion
head
so
proudly
blazoned
on
the
painted
panes
o
sirs
the
simple
wistfulness
of
it
might
move
hard
hearts
to
laughter
but
i
think
tears
tremble
through
it
for
the
mermaid
inn
he
added
his
new
crest
the
sign
and
lowly
prize
of
his
own
industry
and
far
away
the

softly
from
the
pure

his

slowly
the

asks
no
more
of
men
but
that
they
may
sometimes
pray
for
the
souls
of
richard
whittington
alice
his
wife
and
as

had
prayed
the

raleigh
ben
was
our
only
guest
that
day
his
tribe
had
flown
to
their
new
shrine
the
apollo
room
to
which
though
they
enscrolled
his
golden
verse
above
their
doors
like
some
vine
ben
still
preferred
our
and
to
smoke
alone
in
his
old
nook
perhaps
to
hear
the
voices
of
the
dead
the
voices
of
his
old
companions
hovering
near
him
will
and
kit
and
rob
our
from
the
sea
raleigh
he
muttered
as
i
brimmed
his
cup
last
of
the
men
that
broke
the
fleets
of
spain
was
not
enough
to
cage
him
sixteen
years
rotting
his
heart
out
in
the
bloody
tower
but
they
must
fling
him
forth
in
his
old
age
to
hunt
for
el
dorado
then
mine
host
because
his
poor
old
ship
smashes
the
spaniard
but
comes
tottering
home
without
the
spanish
gold
our
gracious
king
to
please
a
catamite
sends
the
old
lion
back
to
the
tower
again
the
friends
of
spain
will
send
him
to
the
block
this
time
that
male
salome
buckingham
is
dancing
for
his
head
raleigh
is
doomed
a
shadow
stood
in
the
doorway
we
looked
up
and
there
but
o
how
changed
how
worn
and
grey
sir
walter
raleigh
like
a
hunted
thing
stared
at
us
ben
he
said
and
glanced
behind
him
ben
took
a
step
towards
him
o
my
god
ben
whispered
the
old
man
in
a
husky
voice
half
timorous
and
half
cunning
so
unlike
his
old
heroic
self
that
one
might
weep
to
hear
it
ben
i
have
given
them
all
the
slip
i
may
be
followed
can
you
hide
me
here
till
it
grows
dark
ben
drew
him
quickly
in
and
motioned
me
to
lock
the
door
till
it
grows
dark
he
cried
my
god
that
you
should
ask
it
do
not
think
do
not
believe
that
i
am
quite
disgraced
the
old
man
faltered
for
they
say
it
ben
and
when
my
boy
grows
up
they
tell
him
too
his
father
was
a
coward
i
do
cling
to
life
for
many
reasons
not
from
fear
of
death
no
ben
i
can
disdain
that
still
but
there
my
boy
then
all
his
face
went
blind
he
dropt
upon
ben
shoulder
and
sobbed
outright
they
are
trying
to
break
my
pride
to
break
my
pride
the
window
darkened
and
i
saw
a
face
blurring
the
panes
ben
gripped
the
old
man
arm
and
led
him
gently
to
a
room
within
out
of
the
way
of
guests
your
pride
he
said
that
is
the
pride
of
england
at
that
name
as
at
a
heard
in
the
night
far
out
at
sea
the
weather
and
man
that
once
was
raleigh
lifted
up
his
head
old
age
and
weakness
weariness
and
fear
fell
from
him
like
a
cloak
he
stood
erect
his
eager
eyes
full
of
great
dawns
burned
for
a
moment
with
immortal
youth
while
tears
blurred
mine
to
see
him
you
do
think
that
england
will
remember
you
do
think
it
he
asked
with
a
great
light
upon
his
face
ben
bowed
his
head
in
silence
i
have
wronged
my
cause
by
this
said
raleigh
well
they
know
it
who
left
this
way
for
me
i
have
flung
myself
like
a
blind
moth
into
this
deadly
light
of
freedom
now
at
the
eleventh
hour
is
it
too
late
i
might
return
and
no
not
now
ben
interrupted
i
have
said
laugh
at
the
headsman
sixteen
years
ago
when
england
was
awake
she
will
awake
again
but
now
while
our
most
gracious
king
who
hates
tobacco
dedicates
his
prayers
to
buckingham
this
is
no
land
for
men
that
under
god
shattered
the
fleet
invincible
a
knock
startled
us
at
the
outer
door
my
friend
stukeley
said
raleigh
if
i
know
his
hand
he
has
a
ketch
will
carry
me
to
france
waiting
at
tilbury
i
let
him
in
a
lean
and
stealthy
fellow
sir
lewis
stukeley
liked
him
little
he
thought
much
of
his
health
more
of
his
money
bags
and
most
of
all
on
how
to
run
with
all
men
all
at
once
for
his
own
profit
at
the
men
disagreed
in
friendship
and
in
truth
but
he
agreed
with
all
men
and
his
life
was
one
soft
quag
of
falsehood
fugitives
must
use
false
keys
i
thought
and
there
was
hope
for
raleigh
if
such
a
man
would
walk
one
mile
to
serve
him
now
yet
my
throat
moved
to
see
him
usurping
with
one
hand
on
raleigh
arm
a
kind
of
ownership
me
ten
were
the
first
words
he
breathed
in
the
old
man
ear
and
raleigh
slipped
his
purse
into
his
hand
just
over
bread
street
hung
the
bruised
white
moon
when
they
crept
out
sir
lewis
stukeley
a
derelict
with
a
mulberry
face
met
them
outside
the
coast
quite
clear
eh
hart
said
stukeley
ah
that
good
lead
on
then
quick
and
there
framed
in
the
cruddle
of
moonlit
clouds
that
ended
the
steep
street
dark
on
its
light
and
standing
on
those
glistening
cobblestones
just
where
they
turned
to
silver
raleigh
looked
back
before
he
turned
the
corner
he
stood
there
a
figure
like
mercury
tall
straight
and
splendid
waving
his
plumed
hat
to
ben
and
taking
his
last
look
i
felt
upon
our
as
he
paused
his
long
fantastic
shadow
swayed
and
swept
against
our
feet
then
like
a
shadow
he
passed
it
is
not
right
said
ben
it
is
not
right
why
did
they
give
the
old
man
so
much
grace
witness
and
evidence
are
what
they
lack
would
you
trust
stukeley
not
to
draw
him
out
raleigh
was
always
rash
a
phrase
or
two
will
turn
their
murderous
axe
into
a
sword
of
righteousness
why
come
to
think
of
it
blackfriar
wharf
last
night
i
landed
there
and
no
by
god
raleigh
is
not
himself
the
tide
will
never
serve
beyond
gravesend
it
is
a
trap
come
on
we
follow
them
quick
to
the
river
side
we
reached
the
wharf
only
to
see
their
wherry
a
small
black
cloud
dwindling
far
down
that
running
silver
road
ben
touched
my
arm
look
there
he
said
pointing
the
moon
glanced
on
a
cluster
of
pikes
like
silver
thorns
three
hundred
yards
away
a
little
troop
of
weaponed
men
embarking
hurriedly
their
great
black
wherry
clumsily
swung
about
then
with
twelve
oars
for
legs
came
striding
down
an
armoured
beetle
on
the
glittering
trail
of
some
small
victim
just
below
our
wharf
a
little
dinghy
waddled
ben
cut
the
painter
and
without
one
word
drew
her
up
crackling
thro
the
lapping
water
motioned
me
to
the
tiller
thrust
her
off
and
pulling
with
one
oar
backing
with
the
other
swirled
her
round
and
down
hard
on
the
track
of
raleigh
ben
was
an
old
man
now
but
tough
o
tough
as
a
buccaneer
we
distanced
them
his
oar
blades
drove
the
silver
boiling
back
by
broken
wharf
the
beetle
was
a
speck
it
dwindled
by
queen
hythe
and
the
three
cranes
by
bellyn
gate
we
had
left
it
out
of
sight
by
custom
house
and
galley
keye
we
shot
thro
silver
all
the
way
without
one
glimpse
of
raleigh
then
a
dreadful
shadow
fell
and
over
us
the
tower
of
london
rose
like
ebony
and
on
the
glittering
reach
beyond
it
i
could
see
the
small
black
cloud
that
carried
the
great
old
seaman
slowly
down
between
the
dark
shores
whence
in
happier
years
the
throng
had
cheered
his
golden
galleons
out
and
watched
his
proud
sails
filling
for
cathay
there
as
through
lead
we
dragged
by
traitor
gate
there
in
the
darkness
under
the
bloody
tower
there
on
the
very
verge
of
victory
ben
gasped
and
dropped
his
oars
take
one
and
row
he
said
my
arms
are
numbed
we
overtake
him
yet
i
clambered
past
him
and
took
the
bow
oar
once
as
the
pace
flagged
over
his
shoulder
he
turned
his
great
scarred
face
and
snarled
with
a
trickle
of
blood
on
his
coarse
lips
hard
and
blood
and
fire
ran
through
my
veins
again
for
half
a
minute
more
yet
we
fell
back
our
course
was
crooked
now
and
suddenly
a
grim
black
speck
began
to
grow
behind
us
grow
like
the
threat
of
death
upon
old
age
then
thickening
blackening
sharpening
foaming
swept
up
the
bright
line
of
bubbles
in
our
wake
that
armoured
wherry
with
its
long
twelve
oars
all
well
together
now
too
late
gasped
ben
his
face
uplifted
to
the
moon
one
quivering
hand
upon
the
thwart
behind
him
a
moment
then
he
bowed
over
his
knees
coughing
but
we
delay
them
we
be
drunk
and
hold
the
up
we
drifted
down
before
them
broadside
on
they
sheered
aside
then
feigning
a
clumsy
stroke
ben
drove
our
craft
as
they
drew
level
right
in
among
their
blades
there
was
a
shout
an
oath
they
thrust
us
off
and
then
we
swung
our
nose
against
their
bows
and
pulled
them
round
with
every
stroke
a
full
half
minute
ere
they
won
quite
free
cursing
us
for
a
pair
of
drunken
fools
we
drifted
down
behind
them
there
no
doubt
said
ben
the
headsman
waits
behind
all
this
for
raleigh
this
is
a
play
to
cheat
the
soul
of
england
teach
the
people
to
applaud
the
red
fifth
act
without
another
word
we
drifted
down
for
centuries
it
seemed
until
we
came
to
greenwich
then
up
the
long
white
burnished
reach
there
crept
like
little
sooty
clouds
the
two
black
boats
to
meet
us
he
is
in
the
trap
said
ben
and
does
not
know
it
yet
see
where
he
sits
by
stukeley
as
by
a
friend
long
after
this
we
heard
how
raleigh
simply
as
a
child
seeing
the
tide
would
never
serve
him
now
and
they
must
turn
had
taken
from
his
neck
some
trinkets
that
he
wore
keep
them
he
said
to
stukeley
in
remembrance
of
this
night
he
had
no
doubts
of
stukeley
when
he
saw
the
wherry
close
beside
them
he
but
wrapped
his
cloak
a
little
closer
round
his
face
our
boat
rocked
in
their
wash
when
stukeley
dropped
the
mask
we
saw
him
give
the
sign
and
heard
his
quavering
voice
in
the
king
name
raleigh
rose
to
his
feet
i
am
under
arrest
he
said
like
a
dazed
man
and
stukeley
laughed
then
as
he
bore
himself
to
the
grim
end
all
doubt
being
over
the
old
stood
among
those
glittering
points
a
king
indeed
the
black
boats
rocked
we
heard
his
level
voice
lewis
these
actions
never
will
turn
out
to
your
good
across
the
moonlit
thames
it
rang
contemptuously
cold
as
cold
steel
and
passionless
as
the
judgment
that
ends
all
some
three
months
later
raleigh
widow
came
to
lodge
a
at
the
mermaid
inn
his
house
in
bread
street
was
no
more
her
own
but
in
the
hands
of
stukeley
who
had
reaped
a
pretty
harvest
she
kept
close
to
her
room
and
that
same
night
being
ill
and
with
some
fever
sent
her
maid
to
fetch
the
apothecary
from
friday
street
old
galen
as
the
mermaid
christened
him
at
that
same
moment
as
the
maid
went
out
stukeley
came
in
he
met
her
at
the
door
and
chucking
her
under
the
chin
gave
her
a
letter
take
this
up
to
your
mistress
it
concerns
her
property
he
said
say
that
i
wait
and
would
be
glad
to
speak
with
her
the
wench
looked
pertly
in
his
face
and
tripped
upstairs
i
scarce
could
trust
my
hands
sir
lewis
i
said
this
is
no
time
to
trouble
her
she
is
let
her
decide
he
answered
with
a
sneer
before
i
found
another
word
to
say
the
maid
tripped
down
again
i
scarce
believed
my
senses
when
she
beckoned
him
up
the
stair
shaking
from
head
to
foot
i
blocked
the
way
property
could
the
crux
of
mine
and
thine
bring
widow
and
murderer
into
one
small
room
sir
lewis
i
said
she
is
ill
it
is
not
right
she
never
would
consent
he
sneered
again
you
are
her
doctor
out
of
the
way
old
fool
she
has
decided
go
i
said
to
the
maid
fetch
the
apothecary
let
it
rest
with
him
she
tossed
her
head
her
quick
eyes
glanced
showing
the
white
like
the
eyes
of
a
vicious
mare
she
laughed
at
stukeley
loitered
then
obeyed
and
so
we
waited
till
the
wench
returned
with
galen
at
her
heels
his
wholesome
face
russet
and
wrinkled
like
an
apple
peered
shrewdly
at
stukeley
twinkled
once
at
me
and
passed
in
silence
leaving
a
whiff
of
herbs
behind
him
on
the
stair
five
minutes
later
to
my
amazement
that
same
wholesome
face
leaned
from
the
lighted
door
above
and
called
sir
lewis
stukeley
sir
judas
hastened
up
the
apothecary
followed
him
within
the
door
shut
i
was
left
there
in
the
dark
bewildered
for
my
heart
was
hot
with
thoughts
of
those
last
months
our
summer
nightingale
our
from
the
sea
the
founder
of
our
mermaid
fellowship
was
this
his
guerdon
at
the
mermaid
inn
was
this
that
whose
romance
with
raleigh
once
had
been
a
kingdom
talk
could
bess
throckmorton
slight
his
memory
thus
it
is
not
right
i
said
it
is
not
right
she
wrongs
him
deeply
i
leaned
against
the
porch
staring
into
the
night
a
ghostly
ray
above
me
from
her
window
bridged
the
street
and
rested
on
the
goldsmith
painted
sign
opposite
i
could
hear
the
muffled
voice
of
stukeley
overhead
persuasive
bland
and
then
her
own
cooing
soft
as
a
dove
calling
her
mate
from
eden
flowed
on
and
on
and
then
all
my
flesh
crept
at
something
worse
than
either
a
long
space
of
silence
that
stretched
threatening
and
cold
cold
as
a
pricking
the
skin
over
my
heart
then
came
a
stifled
cry
a
crashing
door
a
footstep
on
the
stair
blundering
like
a
drunkard
heavily
down
and
with
his
gasping
face
one
tragic
mask
of
horror
may
god
help
me
to
forget
some
day
the
frozen
awful
eyes
of
one
who
fearing
neither
hell
nor
heaven
has
met
that
ultimate
weapon
of
the
gods
the
face
and
that
turn
flesh
to
stone
stukeley
stumbled
groping
his
way
out
blindly
past
me
into
the
sheltering
night
it
was
the
last
night
of
another
year
before
i
understood
what
punishment
had
overtaken
stukeley
ben
and
brome
ben
ancient
servant
but
turned
poet
now
sat
by
the
fire
with
the
old
apothecary
to
see
the
new
year
in
the
starry
night
had
drawn
me
to
the
door
could
it
be
true
that
our
poor
earth
no
longer
was
the
hub
of
those
white
wheeling
orbs
i
scarce
believed
the
strange
new
dreams
but
i
had
seen
the
veils
rent
from
vast
oceans
and
huge
continents
till
what
was
once
our
comfortable
fire
our
cosy
tavern
and
our
earthly
home
with
heaven
beyond
the
next
turn
in
the
road
all
the
resplendent
fabric
of
our
world
shrank
to
a
lighting
up
one
leaf
in
one
small
forest
in
one
little
land
among
those
wild
infinitudes
of
god
a
tattered
wastrel
wandered
down
the
street
clad
in
a
seaman
jersey
staring
hard
at
every
sign
beneath
our
own
the
light
fell
on
his
red
carbuncled
face
i
knew
him
the
hart
he
pointed
to
our
sign
and
leered
at
me
that
her
he
said
no
doubt
the
with
the
shiny
mackerel
tail
swishing
in
wine
that
what
sir
lewis
meant
he
called
it
blood
blood
is
his
craze
you
see
this
is
the
mermaid
tavern
sir
no
doubt
i
nodded
ah
i
thought
as
much
he
said
well
happen
this
is
worth
a
cup
of
ale
he
thrust
his
hand
under
his
jersey
and
lugged
a
greasy
letter
out
it
was
inscribed
the
apothecary
at
the
mermaid
tavern
i
led
him
in
i
knew
it
sir
he
said
while
galen
broke
the
seal
soon
as
i
saw
that
sweet
young
naked
wench
curling
her
tail
in
those
red
the
old
man
called
it
blood
blood
is
his
craze
you
but
you
can
tell
is
wine
sir
by
the
foam
malmsey
no
doubt
and
that
sweet
wench
to
make
you
smack
your
lips
like
oysters
with
her
slippery
tail
and
all
why
sir
no
doubt
this
was
the
mermaid
inn
but
this
said
galen
lifting
his
grave
face
to
ben
this
letter
is
from
all
that
left
of
stukeley
the
good
host
there
thinks
i
wronged
your
memory
from
this
letter
i
think
i
helped
to
avenge
him
do
not
wrong
his
widow
even
in
thought
she
loved
him
dearly
you
know
she
keeps
his
poor
grey
severed
head
embalmed
and
so
will
keep
it
till
she
dies
weeps
over
it
alone
i
have
heard
such
things
in
wild
italian
tales
but
was
true
had
i
refused
to
let
her
speak
with
stukeley
i
feared
she
would
go
mad
this
letter
proves
that
i
and
she
perhaps
were
instruments
of
some
more
terrible
chirurgery
than
either
knew
ah
when
i
saw
your
sign
the
interjected
i
no
doubt
that
letter
was
well
worth
a
cup
of
ale
go
paint
your
bows
with
somewhere
else
not
at
this
inn
said
ben
tossing
the
rogue
a
good
french
crown
pickle
yourself
in
hell
and
hart
lurched
out
into
the
night
again
muttering
thank
you
sirs
was
worth
all
that
no
doubt
at
all
there
are
some
men
said
galen
spreading
the
letter
out
on
his
plump
knees
will
heap
up
wrong
on
wrong
and
at
the
last
wonder
because
the
world
will
not
forget
just
when
it
suits
them
cancel
all
they
owe
and
like
a
mother
hold
its
arms
out
wide
at
their
first
cry
and
sirs
i
do
believe
that
stukeley
on
that
night
had
some
such
wish
to
reconcile
himself
what
else
had
passed
between
the
widow
and
himself
i
know
not
but
she
had
lured
him
on
until
he
thought
that
words
and
smiles
perhaps
a
tear
or
two
might
make
the
widow
take
the
murderer
hand
in
friendship
since
it
might
advantage
both
indeed
he
came
prepared
for
even
more
villains
are
always
fools
a
wicked
act
what
is
it
but
a
false
move
in
the
game
a
blind
man
blunder
a
deaf
man
reply
the
wrong
drug
taken
in
the
dead
of
night
i
always
pity
villains
i
mistook
the
avenger
for
the
victim
there
she
lay
panting
that
night
her
eyes
like
summer
stars
her
pale
gold
hair
upon
the
pillows
tossed
dishevelled
while
the
fever
in
her
face
brought
back
the
lost
wild
roses
of
her
youth
for
half
an
hour
against
a
breast
as
pure
and
smooth
as
any
maid
her
soft
arms
pressed
a
bundle
wrapped
in
a
white
embroidered
cloth
she
crooned
over
it
as
a
mother
croons
over
her
suckling
child
i
stood
beside
her
that
was
her
wish
and
mine
while
stukeley
and
over
against
me
on
the
other
side
stood
stukeley
gnawing
his
nether
lip
to
find
she
could
not
or
she
would
not
speak
one
word
in
answer
to
his
letter
raleigh
you
wrong
me
and
you
wrong
yourself
he
cried
play
like
a
green
girl
when
great
affairs
are
laid
before
you
let
me
speak
with
you
alone
i
am
all
alone
she
said
more
alone
than
i
have
ever
been
in
all
my
life
before
this
is
my
doctor
he
must
not
leave
me
then
she
lured
him
on
played
on
his
brain
as
a
musician
plays
upon
the
lute
me
dear
sir
lewis
if
i
am
grown
too
gay
for
widowhood
but
i
have
pondered
for
a
long
long
time
on
all
these
matters
i
know
the
world
was
right
and
spain
was
right
sir
lewis
yes
and
you
you
too
were
right
and
my
poor
husband
wrong
you
see
i
knew
his
mind
so
very
well
i
knew
his
every
gesture
every
smile
i
lived
with
him
i
think
i
died
with
him
it
is
a
strange
thing
marriage
for
my
soul
as
if
myself
were
present
in
this
flesh
beside
him
slept
in
his
grey
on
that
last
dreadful
dawn
i
heard
the
throng
murmuring
round
the
scaffold
far
away
and
with
the
smell
of
sawdust
in
my
nostrils
i
woke
bewildered
as
himself
to
see
that
tall
figure
by
his
bed
i
heard
the
words
that
made
him
understand
body
of
our
lord
take
and
eat
this
i
rolled
the
small
sour
flakes
beneath
my
tongue
with
him
i
caught
with
him
the
gleam
of
tears
far
off
on
some
strange
face
of
sickly
dread
and
the
cold
cup
was
in
my
hand
cold
as
an
washed
with
waterish
red
i
heard
his
last
poor
cry
to
wife
and
could
any
that
heard
forget
it
true
god
hold
you
both
in
his
arms
both
in
his
and
then
that
last
poor
wish
a
thing
to
raise
a
smile
in
some
i
have
smiled
at
it
myself
a
thousand
times
me
my
he
said
old
winchester
clay
with
the
long
stem
and
half
an
hour
alone
the
crowd
can
wait
they
have
not
waited
half
so
long
as
and
then
o
then
i
know
what
soft
blue
clouds
what
wavering
rings
fragrant
ascending
wreaths
melted
his
prison
walls
to
a
summer
haze
through
which
i
think
he
saw
the
little
port
of
budleigh
salterton
like
a
nest
among
the
devon
cliffs
the
tarry
quay
whence
in
his
boyhood
he
had
flung
a
line
for
bass
or
i
remembered
had
he
not
told
me
on
some
summer
night
his
arm
about
my
neck
kissing
my
hair
he
used
to
sit
there
gazing
out
to
sea
fish
and
for
what
not
all
for
what
he
caught
and
handled
but
for
things
the
that
jewelled
his
thin
line
flotsam
and
jetsam
of
the
while
the
green
water
gurgling
through
the
piles
heaving
and
sinking
helped
him
to
believe
the
quay
a
galleon
plunging
out
superbly
for
cathay
there
would
he
sit
listening
a
radiant
boy
child
of
the
sea
listening
to
some
old
seaman
glowing
tales
his
grey
eyes
rich
with
pictures
then
he
saw
and
i
with
him
that
gathering
in
the
west
to
break
the
fleet
invincible
o
i
heard
the
trumpets
and
the
neighings
and
the
drums
i
watched
the
beacons
on
a
hundred
hills
i
drank
that
wine
of
battle
from
cup
and
gloried
in
it
lying
against
his
heart
i
sailed
with
him
and
saw
the
unknown
worlds
the
slender
ivory
towers
of
old
cathay
rose
for
us
over
seas
that
crumbled
a
foam
on
long
shores
of
shining
sand
shores
of
so
clear
a
glass
they
drew
the
into
their
bosom
and
hung
that
city
of
vision
in
girdling
it
round
as
with
a
moat
of
sky
hopelessly
beautiful
o
yet
i
heard
heard
from
his
blazoned
poops
the
trumpeters
blowing
proud
calls
while
overhead
the
flag
of
england
floated
from
white
towers
of
sail
and
yet
and
yet
i
knew
that
he
was
wrong
and
soon
he
knew
it
too
i
saw
the
cloud
of
doubt
assail
him
in
the
bloody
tower
when
being
withheld
from
sailing
the
high
seas
for
sixteen
years
he
spread
a
prouder
sail
took
up
his
pen
and
walled
about
with
stone
began
to
write
his
of
the
and
emperors
came
like
lazarus
from
the
grave
to
wear
his
purple
and
the
night
disgorged
its
empires
till
o
like
the
swirl
of
dust
around
their
marching
legions
that
dim
cloud
of
doubt
closed
round
him
was
there
any
man
so
sure
of
heart
and
brain
as
to
record
the
simple
truth
of
things
himself
had
seen
then
who
could
plumb
that
night
the
work
broke
off
he
knew
that
he
was
wrong
i
knew
it
too
once
more
that
stately
structure
of
his
dreams
melted
like
mist
his
eagles
perished
like
clouds
death
wound
a
thin
horn
through
the
centuries
the
grave
resumed
his
forlorn
emperors
his
empires
crumbled
back
to
a
little
ash
knocked
from
his
he
dropped
his
pen
in
homage
to
the
truth
the
truth
eloquent
just
and
mighty
death
then
when
he
forged
out
of
one
golden
thought
a
key
to
open
his
prison
when
the
king
released
him
for
a
tale
of
faërie
gold
under
the
tropic
palms
when
those
grey
walls
melted
before
his
passion
do
you
think
the
gold
that
lured
the
king
was
quite
the
same
as
that
which
raleigh
saw
you
know
the
song
say
to
the
king
quoth
raleigh
i
have
a
tale
to
tell
him
wealth
beyond
derision
veils
to
lift
from
the
sky
seas
to
sail
for
england
and
a
little
dream
to
sell
him
gold
the
gold
of
a
vision
that
angels
can
not
buy
ah
no
for
all
the
beauty
and
the
pride
raleigh
was
wrong
but
not
so
wrong
i
think
as
those
for
whom
his
kingdoms
oversea
meant
only
glittering
dust
the
fight
he
waged
was
not
with
them
they
never
worsted
him
it
was
that
brought
him
home
without
the
spanish
o
he
was
wrong
but
such
a
wrong
in
gloriana
day
was
more
than
right
was
immortality
he
had
just
half
an
hour
to
put
all
this
into
his
pipe
and
smoke
it
the
red
fire
the
red
heroic
fire
that
filled
his
veins
when
the
proud
flag
of
england
floated
out
its
challenge
to
the
world
all
gone
to
ash
what
was
the
great
red
wine
that
drake
had
quaffed
vinegar
he
must
fawn
haul
down
his
flag
and
count
all
nations
nobler
than
his
own
tear
out
the
lions
from
the
painted
shields
that
hung
his
poop
for
fear
that
he
offend
the
pride
of
spain
treason
to
sack
the
ships
of
spain
the
wounds
of
slaughtered
englishmen
cried
out
is
no
law
beyond
the
line
treason
to
sweep
the
seas
with
francis
drake
treason
to
fight
for
england
if
it
were
so
the
times
had
changed
and
quickly
he
had
been
a
schoolboy
in
the
morning
of
the
world
playing
with
wooden
swords
and
winning
crowns
of
tinsel
but
his
comrades
had
outgrown
their
and
gathered
round
to
mock
his
battles
in
the
sunset
yet
he
knew
that
all
his
life
had
passed
in
that
brief
day
and
he
was
old
too
old
to
understand
the
smile
upon
the
face
of
buckingham
the
smile
on
cobham
face
at
that
great
word
he
knew
the
solid
earth
was
changed
to
something
less
than
dust
among
the
stars
and
o
be
sure
he
knew
that
he
was
wrong
that
gleams
would
come
gleams
of
a
happier
world
for
younger
men
that
commonwealth
far
off
this
was
a
time
of
sadder
things
destruction
of
the
old
before
the
new
was
born
at
least
he
knew
it
was
his
own
way
that
had
brought
the
world
thus
far
england
thus
far
how
could
he
change
who
had
loved
england
as
a
man
might
love
his
mistress
change
from
year
to
fickle
year
for
the
new
years
would
change
even
as
the
old
no
he
was
wedded
to
that
old
first
love
crude
flesh
and
blood
and
coarse
as
meat
and
drink
the
woman
england
no
fine
ruled
by
that
male

better
the
axe
than
to
live
on
and
wage
these
new
and
silent
and
more
deadly
wars
that
play
at
friendship
with
our
enemies
such
times
are
evil
not
of
their
own
desire
they
lead
to
good
blind
agents
of
that
hand
which
now
had
hewed
him
down
down
to
his
knees
but
in
a
prouder
battle
than
men
knew
his
pipe
was
out
the
guard
was
at
the
door
raleigh
was
not
a
god
but
when
he
climbed
the
scaffold
i
believe
he
looked
a
man
and
when
the
axe
fell
i
believe
that
god
set
on
his
shoulders
that
immortal
head
which
he
desired
on
earth
o
he
was
wrong
but
when
that
axe
fell
not
one
shout
was
raised
that
mighty
throng
around
that
crimson
block
stood
silent
like
the
hushed
black
cloud
that
holds
the
thunder
you
might
hear
the
headsman
breath
stillness
like
that
is
dangerous
being
charged
sometimes
with
thought
sir
lewis
england
sleeps
what
if
one
day
the
stewart
should
be
called
to
know
that
england
wakes
what
if
a
shout
should
whitehall
and
the
dogs
lift
their
heads
along
the
fringes
of
the
crowd
to
catch
a
certain
savour
that
i
know
the
smell
of
blood
and
sawdust
ah
sir
lewis
is
hard
to
find
one
little
seed
of
right
among
so
many
wrongs
raleigh
was
wrong
and
yet
it
was
because
he
loved
his
country
next
to
himself
sir
lewis
by
your
leave
his
country
butchered
him
you
did
not
know
that
i
was
only
third
in
his
affections
the
night
i
told
him
we
were
parting
then
i
had
begged
the
last
disposal
of
his
body
did
he
not
say
with
o
so
gentle
a
smile
hadst
not
always
the
disposal
of
it
in
life
dear
bess
is
well
it
should
be
thine
in
death
jest
was
bitter
at
such
an
hour
and
somewhat
coarse
in
grain
stukeley
replied
i
thought
him
kinder
she
said
laughing
bitterly
stukeley
looked
at
her
she
whispered
something
and
his
lewd
old
eyes
fastened
upon
her
own
he
knelt
by
her
he
said
woman
wit
has
found
a
better
way
to
solve
this
bitter
business
her
head
moved
on
the
pillow
with
little
tossings
he
touched
her
hand
it
leapt
quickly
away
she
hugged
that
strange
white
bundle
to
her
breast
and
writhed
back
smiling
at
him
across
the
bed
bess
he
whispered
huskily
pressing
his
lips
to
that
warm
hollow
where
her
head
had
lain
is
one
way
to
close
the
long
dispute
keep
the
estates
unbroken
in
your
hands
and
stop
all
slanderous
tongues
one
happy
way
we
have
some
years
to
live
and
why
alone
she
sighed
husband
thought
of
that
he
wrote
a
letter
to
me
long
ago
when
he
was
first
condemned
he
said
he
said
now
let
me
think
what
was
it
that
he
said
i
had
it
all
by
heart
you
bess
hide
not
yourself
for
many
he
said
wisdom
that
quoth
stukeley
the
love
that
seeks
to
chain
the
living
to
the
dead
is
but
at
best
yet
she
said
his
poor
heart
was
torn
between
two
cares
love
of
himself
and
care
for
me
as
thus
god
begin
to
repose
yourself
on
him
therein
you
shall
find
true
and
lasting
riches
but
all
the
rest
is
nothing
when
you
have
tired
your
thoughts
on
earthly
things
when
you
have
travelled
through
all
the
glittering
pomps
of
this
proud
world
you
shall
sit
down
by
sorrow
in
the
end
begin
betimes
and
teach
your
little
son
to
serve
and
fear
god
also
then
god
will
be
a
husband
unto
you
and
unto
him
a
father
nor
can
death
bereave
you
any
more
when
i
am
gone
no
doubt
you
shall
be
sought
unto
by
many
for
the
world
thinks
that
i
was
very
rich
no
greater
misery
can
befall
you
bess
than
to
become
a
prey
and
afterwards
to
be
despised
enough
said
stukeley
yet
no
quoth
she
have
not
heard
the
end
knows
i
speak
it
not
to
dissuade
not
to
dissuade
you
mark
marriage
that
will
be
the
best
for
you
both
in
respect
of
god
and
of
the
was
sir
lewis
ah
not
all
and
thus
he
ended
his
father
sake
that
chose
and
loved
you
in
his
happiest
times
remember
your
poor
child
the
everlasting
infinite
powerful
and
inscrutable
god
keep
you
and
yours
have
mercy
upon
me
and
teach
me
to
forgive
my
false
wrong
even
in
death
you

then
true
wife
farewell
bless
my
poor
boy
pray
for
me
my
true
god
hold
you
both
in
his
arms
both
in
his
arms
i
know
that
he
was
wrong
you
did
not
know
sir
lewis
that
he
had
left
me
a
little
child
come
closer
you
shall
see
its
orphaned
face
the
sad
sad
relict
of
a
man
that
loved
his
country
all
that
left
to
me
come
look
she
beckoned
stukeley
nearer
he
bent
down
curiously
her
feverish
fingers
drew
the
white
wrap
from
the
bundle
in
her
arms
and
with
a
smile
that
would
make
angels
weep
she
showed
him
pressed
against
her
naked
breast
terrible
as
medusa
the
grey
flesh
and
shrivelled
face
embalmed
the
thing
that
dropped
into
the
headsman
basket
months
agone
the
head
of
raleigh
half
her
body
lay
bare
while
she
held
that
grey
babe
to
her
heart
but
judas
hid
his
face
she
said
was
not
always
mine
but
dead
i
shall
not
wean
him
then
i
too
covered
my
face
i
can
not
tell
you
more
there
was
a
dreadful
silence
in
that
room
silence
that
as
i
know
shattered
the
brain
of
when
i
dared
to
raise
my
head
beneath
that
silent
thunder
of
our
god
the
man
had
gone
this
is
his
letter
sirs
written
from
lundy
island
god
love
tell
them
it
is
a
cruel
thing
to
say
that
i
drink
blood
i
have
no
secret
sin
a
thousand
pound
is
not
so
great
a
sum
and
that
is
all
they
paid
me
every
penny
salt
water
that
is
all
the
drink
i
taste
on
this
rough
island
somebody
has
taught
the
how
to
wail
around
my
hut
all
night
like
lost
souls
and
there
is
a
face
a
dead
man
face
that
laughs
in
every
storm
and
sleeps
in
every
pool
along
the
coast
i
thought
it
was
my
own
once
but
i
know
these
actions
never
never
on
god
earth
will
turn
out
to
their
credit
who
believe
that
i
drink
he
crumpled
up
the
letter
and
tossed
it
into
the
fire
galen
said
ben
i
think
you
are
right
that
one
should
pity
villains
the
clock
struck
twelve
the
bells
began
to
peal
we
drank
a
cup
of
sack
to
the
new
year
new
songs
new
voices
all
as
fresh
as
may
said
ben
to
brome
but
i
shall
never
live
to
hear
them
all
was
not
so
well
indeed
with
ben
as
hitherto
age
had
come
upon
him
he
dragged
one
foot
as
in
paralysis
the
critics
bayed
against
the
old
lion
now
and
called
him
arrogant
my
brain
he
said
is
yet
unhurt
although
set
round
with
pain
it
can
not
long
hold
out
he
never
stooped
never
once
pandered
to
that
brainless
hour
his
coat
was
weeks
had
passed
of
late
without
his
voice
resounding
in
our
inn
the
statues
are
defiled
the
gods
dethroned
the
ionian
movement
reigns
not
the
free
soul
and
as
for
me
i
have
lived
too
long
he
said
well
i
can
weave
the
old
threnodies
anew
and
filling
his
cup
he
murmured
soft
and
low
a
new
song
breaking
on
an
ancient
shore
i
marlowe
is
dead
and
greene
is
in
his
grave
and
sweet
will
shakespeare
long
ago
is
gone
our
sleeps
beneath
the
wave
robin
is
dead
and
marlowe
in
his
grave
why
should
i
stay
to
chant
an
idle
stave
and
in
my
mermaid
tavern
drink
alone
for
kit
is
dead
and
greene
is
in
his
grave
and
sweet
will
shakespeare
long
ago
is
gone
ii
where
is
the
singer
of
the
faërie
queen
where
are
the
lyric
lips
of
astrophel
long
long
ago
their
quiet
graves
were
green
ay
and
the
grave
too
of
their
faërie
queen
and
yet
their
faces
hovering
here
unseen
call
me
to
taste
their
oenomel
to
sup
with
him
who
sang
the
faërie
queen
to
drink
with
him
whose
name
was
astrophel
iii
i
drink
to
that
great
inn
beyond
the
grave
if
there
be
none
the
gods
have
done
us
ere
long
i
hope
to
chant
a
better
stave
in
some
great
mermaid
inn
beyond
the
grave
and
quaff
the
best
of
earth
that
heaven
can
save
red
wine
like
blood
deep
love
of
friends
and
song
i
drink
to
that
great
inn
beyond
the
grave
and
hope
to
greet
my
golden
lads
ere
long
he
raised
his
cup
and
drank
in
silence
brome
drank
with
him
too
the
bells
had
ceased
to
peal
galen
shook
hands
and
bade
us
all
then
brome
a
little
wistfully
i
thought
looked
at
his
master
and
prepared
to
follow
ben
he
said
a
pause
before
he
spoke
the
name
my
dear
old
brome
said
ben
and
at
the
door
brome
whispered
to
me
he
is
lonely
now
there
are
not
many
left
of
his
old
friends
we
all
go
out
like
this
into
the
night
but
what
a
fleet
of
stars
he
said
and
shook
my
hand
and
smiled
and
pointed
to
the
sky
and
when
i
looked
into
the
room
again
the
lights
were
very
dim
and
i
believed
that
ben
had
fallen
asleep
his
great
grey
head
was
bowed
across
the
table
on
his
arms
then
all
at
once
i
knew
that
he
was
weeping
and
like
a
shadow
i
crept
back
again
and
stole
into
the
night
there
as
i
stood
under
the
painted
sign
i
could
have
vowed
that
i
too
heard
the
voices
of
the
dead
the
voices
of
his
old
companions
gathering
round
him
in
that
lonely
room
till
all
the
timbers
of
the
mermaid
inn
trembled
above
me
with
their
ghostly
song
i
say
to
the
king
quoth
raleigh
i
have
a
tale
to
tell
him
wealth
beyond
derision
veils
to
lift
from
the
sky
seas
to
sail
for
england
and
a
little
dream
to
sell
him
gold
the
gold
of
a
vision
that
angels
can
not
buy
ii
fair
thro
the
walls
of
his
dungeon
what
were
the
stones
but
a
shadow
streamed
the
light
of
the
rapture
the
lure
that
he
followed
of
old
the
dream
of
his
old
companions
the
vision
of
el
dorado
the
fleet
that
they
never
could
capture
the
city
of
iii
yet
did
they
sail
the
seas
and
dazed
with
exceeding
wonder
straight
through
the
plunge
into
the
dawn
leaving
their
home
behind
them
by
a
road
of
splendour
and
thunder
they
came
to
their
home
in
amazement
simply
by
sailing
on
new
poems
a
watchword
of
the
fleet
purposes
of
recognition
at
night
a
small
squadron
of
elizabethan
ships
crossing
the
atlantic
adopted
as
a
watchword
the
sentence
before
the
world
was
they
diced
with
death
their
big
were
greased
with
blood
they
swept
the
seas
for
england
and
we
reap
the
fruits
of
their
heroic
deviltries
our
creed
is
in
the
cold
machine
the
inhuman
devildoms
of
brain
the
bolt
that
splits
the
midnight
main
loosed
at
a
lever
touch
the
lean
torpedo
twenty
miles
of
power

dreadnoughts
dark
array
yet
we
that
keep
the
conning
tower
are
not
so
strong
as
they
whose
watchword
we
disdain
they
laughed
at
odds
for
england
sake
we
count
yet
cast
our
strength
away
one
admiral
with
the
soul
of
drake
would
break
the
fleets
of
hell
give
us
the
splendid
heavens
of
youth
give
us
the
banners
of
deathless
flame
the
ringing
watchwords
of
their
fame
the
faith
the
hope
the
simple
truth
then
shall
the
deep
indeed
be
swayed
through
all
its
boundless
breadth
and
length
nor
this
proud

lean
dismayed
on
twenty
miles
of
strength

around

period

the
huge

that
raleigh
trod
over

petty

only
they
who
reverence
life
can
nobly
lay
it
down
and
these
will
ride
from
child
and
home
and
love
through
death
and
hell
that
day
but
o
her
faith
her
flag
must
burn
above
her
soul
must
lead
the
way
the
dawn
of
peace
yes
on
our
brows
we
feel
the
breath
of
dawn
though
in
the
night
we
wait
an
arrow
is
in
the
heart
of
death
a
god
is
at
the
doors
of
fate
the
spirit
that
moved
upon
the
deep
is
moving
through
the
minds
of
men
the
nations
feel
it
in
their
sleep
a
change
has
touched
their
dreams
again
voices
confused
and
faint
arise
troubling
their
hearts
from
east
and
west
a
doubtful
light
is
in
their
skies
a
gleam
that
will
not
let
them
rest
the
dawn
the
dawn
is
on
the
wing
the
stir
of
change
on
every
side
unsignalled
as
the
approach
of
spring
invincible
as
the
have
ye
not
heard
it
far
and
nigh
the
voice
of
france
across
the
dark
and
all
the
atlantic
with
one
cry
beating
the
shores
of
europe
hark
then
if
ye
will
uplift
your
word
of
cynic
wisdom
once
again
tell
us
he
came
to
bring
a
sword
tell
us
he
lived
and
died
in
vain
say
that
we
dream
our
dreams
have
woven
truths
that
the
burning
sun
the
lightnings
that
we
dreamed
have
cloven
time
space
and
linked
all
lands
in
one
dreams
but
their
swift
celestial
fingers
have
knit
the
world
with
threads
of
steel
till
no
remotest
island
lingers
beyond
the
world
one
commonweal
tell
us
that
custom
sloth
and
fear
are
strong
then
name
them
tell
us
that
greed
rules
everywhere
then
dub
the
lie
experience
year
after
year
age
after
age
has
handed
down
thro
fool
and
child
for
earth
divinest
heritage
the
dreams
whereon
old
wisdom
smiled
dreams
are
they
but
ye
can
not
stay
them
or
thrust
the
dawn
back
for
one
hour
truth
love
and
justice
if
ye
slay
them
return
with
more
than
earthly
power
strive
if
ye
will
to
seal
the
fountains
that
send
the
spring
thro
leaf
and
spray
drive
back
the
sun
from
the
eastern
mountains
then
bid
this
mightier
movement
stay
it
is
the
dawn
of
peace
the
nations
from
east
to
west
have
heard
a
cry
through
all
earth
generations
by
hate
and
slaughter
climbed
thus
high
here
on
this
height
still
to
aspire
one
only
path
remains
untrod
one
path
of
love
and
peace
climbs
higher
make
straight
that
highway
for
our
god
the
bringers
of
good
news
like
fallen
stars
the
gleamed
along
our
menaced
age
that
night
our
bivouacked
century
tossed
and
dreamed
of
battle
with
the
approaching
light
rumors
of
change
a
roar
shook
the
firm
earth
with
doubt
and
dread
the
clouds
in
rushing
legions
bore
their
tattered
eagles
overhead
i
saw
the
muffled
sentries
rest
on
the
dark
hills
of
time
i
saw
around
them
march
from
east
to
west
the
stars
of
the
unresting
law
i
knew
that
in
their
mighty
course
they
brought
the
dawn
they
brought
the
day
and
that
the
unconquerable
force
of
the
new
years
was
on
the
way
i
heard
the
feet
of
that
great
throng
i
saw
them
shine
like
hope
afar
their
shout
their
shout
was
like
a
song
and
o
was
not
a
song
of
war
yet
as
the
whole
world
with
their
tramp
quivered
a
spoke
a
bugle
warned
our
darkling
camp
and
like
a
it
woke
our
searchlights
raked
the
world
wide
ends
the
dark
hills
a
grey
light
crept
down
through
the
light
that
host
of
friends
we
took
for
foemen
triumphing
swept
the
old
century
could
not
hear
their
cry
how
should
it
hear
the
song
they
sang
bring
good
news
it
pierced
the
sky
bring
good
news
the
welkin
rang
one
shout
of
triumph
and
of
faith
and
then
our
shattering
cannon
roared
but
over
the
reeking
ranks
of
death
the
song
rose
like
a
single
sword
bring
good
news
red
flared
the
guns
bring
good
news
the
sabres
flashed
and
the
dark
age
with
its
own
sons
in
blind
and
furious
battle
clashed
a
swift
a
terrible
bugle
pealed
the
sulphurous
clouds
were
rolled
away
embraced
embraced
on
that
red
field
the
wounded
and
the
dying
lay
bring
good
news
blood
choked
the
word
knew
you
not
so
dark
the
night
o
father
was
i
worth
your
sword
o
son
o
herald
of
the
light
bring
good
news
the
darkness
fills
mine
eyes
nay
the
night
ebbs
away
and
over
the
everlasting
hills
the
great
new
dawn
led
on
the
day
the
lonely
shrine
few
months
after
the
milton
i
the
crowd
has
passed
away
faded
the
feast
and
most
forget
master
we
come
with
lowly
hearts
to
pay
our
deeper
debt
ii
high
they
upheld
the
wine
and
royally
royally
drank
to
thee
loud
were
their
plaudits
now
the
lonely
shrine
accepts
our
knee
iii
all
dark
and
silent
now
master
thy
few
are
faithful
still
and
nightly
hear
thy
brooks
that
warbling
flow
by
siloa
hill
at
noon
after
the
french
of
verlaine
the
sky
is
blue
above
the
roof
so
calm
so
blue
one
rustling
bough
above
the
roof
rocks
the
noon
through
the
in
the
sky
aloof
tenderly
rings
a
bird
upon
the
bough
aloof
sorrows
and
sings
my
god
my
god
and
life
is
here
so
simple
and
still
far
off
the
murmuring
town
i
hear
at
the
wind
will
hast
thou
done
thou
weeping
there
o
quick
the
truth
what
hast
thou
done
thou
weeping
there
with
thy
lost
youth
to
a
friend
of
boyhood
lost
at
sea
o
warm
blue
sky
and
dazzling
sea
where
have
you
hid
my
friend
from
me
the
coast
the
leagues
of
surf
laugh
to
the
now
as
then
and
violets
in
the
short
sweet
turf
make
fragmentary
heavens
again
and
wings
of
rustling
snow
pass
and
as
long
ago
old
friend
do
you
remember
yet
the
days
when
secretly
we
met
in
that
old
harbor
years
where
i
admired
your
billowing
walk
or
in
that
perilous
fishing
smack
what
tarry
oaths
perfumed
your
talk
the
sails
we
set
the
ropes
we
spliced
the
raw
potato
that
we
sliced
for
and
how
it
shines
far
down
at
end
of
the
taut
lines
and
the
great
catch
we
made
that
day
loading
our
boat
with
rainbows
quick
and
quivering
while
you
smoked
your
clay
and
i
took
home
your
deadwood
dick
in
yellow
and
red
when
day
was
done
and
you
took
home
my
stevenson
not
leagues
as
when
you
sailed
the
deep
but
only
some
frail
bars
of
sleep
sever
us
now
methinks
you
still
recall
as
i
in
dreams
the
quay
the
little
port
below
the
hill
and
all
the
changes
of
the
sea
like
some
great
music
can
but
roll
our
lives
still
nearer
to
the
goal
our
lady
of
the
twilight
our
lady
of
the
twilight
from
out
the
comes
gently
stealing
the
world
and
stretches
out
her
hands
over
the
blotched
and
broken
wall
the
blind
and
foetid
lane
she
stretches
out
her
hands
and
all
is
beautiful
again
no
factory
chimneys
can
defile
the
beauty
of
her
dress
she
stoops
down
with
her
heavenly
smile
to
heal
and
love
and
bless
all
tortured
things
all
evil
powers
all
shapes
of
dark
distress
are
turned
to
fragrance
and
to
flowers
beneath
her
kind
caress
our
lady
of
the
twilight
she
melts
our
she
makes
the
sea
forget
the
shore
she
fills
the
sky
with
stars
and
stooping
over
wharf
and
mill
chimney
and
shed
and
dome
turns
them
to
fairy
palaces
then
calls
her
children
home
she
stoops
to
bless
the
stunted
tree
and
from
the
furrowed
plain
and
from
the
wrinkled
brow
she
smooths
the
lines
of
care
and
pain
hers
are
the
gentle
hands
and
eyes
and
hers
the
peaceful
breath
that
ope
in
skies
the
quiet
gates
of
death
lady
of
the
twilight
she
hath
such
gentle
hands
so
lovely
are
the
gifts
she
brings
from
out
the
so
bountiful
so
merciful
so
sweet
of
soul
is
she
and
over
all
the
world
she
draws
her
cloak
of
the
will
lift
up
mine
eyes
to
the
hills
i
through
the
dew
moving
through
the
dew
ere
i
waken
in
the
city
life
thy
dawn
makes
all
things
new
and
up
a
glen
far
from
all
the
haunts
of
men
up
a
glen
among
the
mountains
oh
my
feet
are
wings
again
moving
through
the
dew
moving
through
the
dew
o
mountains
of
my
boyhood
i
come
again
to
you
by
the
little
path
i
know
with
the
sea
far
below
and
above
the
great
with
their
sails
of
rose
and
snow
as
of
old
when
all
was
young
and
the
earth
a
song
unsung
and
the
heather
through
the
crimson
dawn
its
eden
incense
flung
from
the
of
joy
for
a
boy
and
the
lavrocks
rose
like
fountain
sprays
of
bliss
that
could
cloy
from
their
little
beds
of
bloom
from
the
golden
gorse
and
broom
with
a
song
to
god
the
giver
that
waste
of
wild
perfume
blowing
from
height
to
height
in
a
glory
of
great
light
while
the
valleys
held
the
lilac
last
of
night
so
when
dawn
is
in
the
skies
in
a
dream
a
dream
i
rise
and
i
follow
my
lost
boyhood
to
the
heights
of
paradise
life
thy
dawn
makes
all
things
new
hills
of
youth
i
come
to
you
moving
through
the
dew

through
the
dew
ii
moving
through
the
dew
moving
through
the
dew
floats
a
brother
face
to
meet
me
is
it
you
is
it
you
for
the
night
i
leave
behind
keeps
these
dazzled
eyes
still
blind
but
oh
the
little
their
scent
is
wise
and
kind
and
i
shall
not
lose
the
way
from
the
darkness
to
the
day
while
dust
can
cling
as
their
scent
clings
to
memory
for
aye
and
the
least
link
in
the
chain
can
recall
the
whole
again
and
heaven
at
last
resume
its
harvests
grain
by
grain
to
the
clings
my
dust
and
tho
eyeless
death
may
thrust
all
else
into
the
darkness
in
their
heaven
i
put
my
trust
and
a
dawn
shall
bid
me
climb
to
the
little
spread
of
thyme
where
first
i
heard
the
ripple
of
the
of
rhyme
and
a
that
i
know
from

the
hawker

down

street

doors

simmering
in

brings
a
dream
to
london

drags
his
weary
feet
lavender
lavender
from
where
the
bee
hums
to
the
loud
roar

full
of
lavender

dreams
he

is
it
nought
to
you

him
with
the
old
strange
cry
the
weary
hawker
passes
and
some
will
come
and
buy
and
some
will
let
him
pass
away
and
only
heave
a
sigh
but
most
will
neither
heed
nor
hear
when
dreams
go
by
lavender
his
songs
were
fair
and
sweet
he
brought
us
harvests
out
of
heaven
full
sheaves
of
radiant
wheat
he
brought
us
keys
to
paradise
and
hawked
them
thro
the
street
he
brought
his
dreams
to
london
and
dragged
his
weary
lavender
lavender
he
is
gone
the
sunset
glows
but
through
the
brain
of
london
the
mystic
fragrance
flows
each
foggy
cell
remembers
each
raggèd
alley
knows
the
land
he
left
behind
him
the
land
to
which
he
goes
the
end
