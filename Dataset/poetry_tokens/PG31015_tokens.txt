a
child
grave
at

born

died
november
i
of
english
blood
of
tuscan
birth
what
country
should
we
give
her
instead
of
any
on
the
earth
the
civic
heavens
receive
her
ii
and
here
among
the
english
tombs
in
tuscan
ground
we
lay
her
while
the
blue
tuscan
sky
endomes
our
english
words
of
prayer
iii
a
little
child
how
long
she
lived
by
months
not
years
is
reckoned
born
in
one
july
she
survived
alone
to
see
a
second
iv
as
the
july
sun
her
little
face
still
played
in
and
splendours
with
her
birth
begun
had
had
no
time
for
fading
so
lily
from
those
july
hours
no
wonder
we
should
call
her
she
looked
such
kinship
to
the
flowers
was
but
a
little
taller
vi
a
tuscan
lily
only
white
as
dante
in
abhorrence
of
red
corruption
wished
aright
the
lilies
of
his
florence
vii
we
could
not
wish
her
whiter
her
who
perfumed
with
pure
blossom
the
house
a
lovely
thing
to
wear
upon
a
mother
bosom
viii
this
july
creature
thought
perhaps
our
speech
not
worth
assuming
she
sat
upon
her
parents
laps
and
mimicked
the
gnat
humming
ix
said
father
mother
then
left
off
for
tongues
celestial
fitter
her
hair
had
grown
just
long
enough
to
catch
heaven
babes
love
could
always
hear
and
see
behind
the
cloud
that
hid
them
let
little
children
come
to
me
and
do
not
thou
forbid
them
xi
so
unforbidding
have
we
met
and
gently
here
have
laid
her
though
winter
is
no
time
to
get
the
flowers
that
should
her
xii
we
should
bring
pansies
quick
with
spring
rose
violet
daffodilly
and
also
above
everything
white
lilies
for
our
lily
xiii
nay
more
than
flowers
this
grave
exacts
glad
grateful
attestations
of
her
sweet
eyes
and
pretty
acts
with
calm
renunciations
xiv
her
very
mother
with
light
feet
should
leave
the
place
too
earthy
saying
the
angels
have
thee
sweet
because
we
are
not
worthy
xv
but
winter
kills
the
the
gardens
in
the
frost
are
and
all
the
heart
dissolves
in
floods
remembering
we
have
lost
her
xvi
poor
earth
poor
heart
too
weak
too
weak
to
miss
the
july
shining
poor
heart
what
bitter
words
we
speak
when
god
speaks
of
resigning
xvii
sustain
this
heart
in
us
that
faints
thou
god
the
we
catch
up
wild
at
parting
saints
and
feel
thy
heaven
too
distant
xviii
the
wind
that
swept
them
out
of
sin
has
ruffled
all
our
vesture
on
the
shut
door
that
let
them
in
we
beat
with
frantic
gesture
xix
to
us
us
also
open
straight
the
outer
life
is
chilly
are
too
like
the
earth
to
wait
till
next
year
for
our
lily
xx
oh
my
own
baby
on
my
knees
my
leaping
dimpled
treasure
at
every
word
i
write
like
these
clasped
close
with
stronger
pressure
xxi
too
well
my
own
heart
understands
at
every
word
beats
fuller
my
little
feet
my
little
hands
and
hair
of
lily
colour
xxii
but
god
gives
patience
love
learns
strength
and
faith
remembers
promise
and
hope
itself
can
smile
at
length
on
other
hopes
gone
from
us
xxiii
love
strong
as
death
shall
conquer
death
through
struggle
made
more
glorious
this
mother
stills
her
sobbing
breath
renouncing
yet
victorious
xxiv
arms
empty
of
her
child
she
lifts
with
spirit
unbereaven
god
will
not
all
take
back
his
gifts
my
lily
mine
in
heaven
xxv
still
mine
maternal
rights
serene
not
given
to
another
the
crystal
bars
shine
faint
between
the
souls
of
child
and
mother
xxvi
meanwhile
the
mother
cries
content
our
love
was
well
divided
its
sweetness
following
where
she
went
its
anguish
stayed
where
i
did
xxvii
well
done
of
god
to
halve
the
lot
and
give
her
all
the
sweetness

tell
thee

smiling
angel
close

stand
in

fashion

bear
a
lily
in

hand
for
death
annunciation
catarina
to
camoens
dying
in
his
absence
abroad
and
referring
to
the
poem
in
which
he
recorded
the
sweetness
of
her
eyes
i
on
the
door
you
will
not
enter
i
have
gazed
too
long
adieu
hope
withdraws
her
peradventure
death
is
near
me
and
not
come
o
lover
close
and
cover
these
poor
eyes
you
called
i
ween
sweetest
eyes
were
ever
seen
ii
when
i
heard
you
sing
that
burden
in
my
vernal
days
and
bowers
other
praises
disregarding
i
but
hearkened
that
of
yours
only
saying
in
blessed
eyes
mine
eyes
have
been
if
the
sweetest
his
have
seen
iii
but
all
changes
at
this
vesper
cold
the
sun
shines
down
the
door
if
you
stood
there
would
you
whisper
love
i
love
you
as
before
death
pervading
now
and
shading
eyes
you
sang
of
that
yestreen
as
the
sweetest
ever
seen
iv
yes
i
think
were
you
beside
them
near
the
bed
i
die
upon
though
their
beauty
you
denied
them
as
you
stood
there
looking
down
you
would
truly
call
them
duly
for
the
love
sake
found
therein
sweetest
eyes
were
ever
seen
and
if
looked
down
upon
them
and
if
looked
up
to
all
the
light
which
has
foregone
them
would
be
gathered
back
anew
they
would
truly
be
as
duly
to
beauty
sheen
sweetest
eyes
were
ever
seen
vi
but
ah
me
you
only
see
me
in
your
thoughts
of
loving
man
smiling
soft
perhaps
and
dreamy
through
the
wavings
of
my
fan
and
unweeting
go
repeating
in
your
reverie
serene
sweetest
eyes
were
ever
seen
vii
while
my
spirit
leans
and
reaches
from
my
body
still
and
pale
fain
to
hear
what
tender
speech
is
in
your
love
to
help
my
bale
o
my
poet
come
and
show
it
come
of
latest
love

glean
sweetest
eyes

viii
o
my
poet
o
my
prophet
when
you
praised
their
sweetness
so
did
you
think
in
singing
of
it
that
it
might
be
near
to
go
had
you
fancies
from
their
glances
that
the
grave
would
quickly
screen
sweetest
eyes

ever

ix
no
reply
the
fountain
warble
in
the
courtyard
sounds
alone
as
the
water
to
the
marble
so
my
heart
falls
with
a
moan
from
to
this
dying
death

win

when

you
walk

this

was
dying

on

ii
love
came
by

fabled

gently
stooped

laid
upon
her
mystic
chrism
of

drew
his

across

folded
eyelids

dips
breathed
as
finely
as

cold
did
through

locking
of
her

so
when
life
looked
upward
being
warmed
and
breathed
on
from
above
what
sight
could
she
have
for
seeing
evermore

only
love
a
denial

met

count
what
feelings
used

move
me
can
this
love
assort
with
those
thou
who
art
so
far

thou
stoop
so
for
repose
is
it
true
that
thou

me
viii
do
not
blame
me
if
i
doubt
thee
i
can
call
love
by
its
name
when
thine
arm
is
wrapt
about
me
but
even
love
seems
not
the
same
when
i
sit
alone
without
thee
ix
in
thy
clear
eyes
i
descried
many
a
proof
of
love
but
those
unbelied
speechful
eyes
being
gone
away
there
the
proof
to
seek
beside
dost
thou
love
me

answer
yes

thou
gone
the
proof
disprovèd

rings
answerless

glow

you
find
budding
blooming

pluck
the

you
shall
be
safe

oh
wilt
thou
have
my
hand
dear

lie
along

white
my
cheek
is
worn
by
many
a
tear
run
down
now
leave
a
little
space
dear
lest
it
should
wet
thine
own
iii
oh
must
thou
have
my
soul
dear
commingled
with
thy
soul
red
grows
the
cheek
and
warm
the
hand
the
part
is
in
the
whole
nor
hands
nor
cheeks
keep
separate
when
soul
is
joined
to
soul
insufficiency
i
there
is
no
one
beside
thee
and
no
one
above
thee
thou
standest
alone
as
the
nightingale
sings
and
my
words
that
would
praise
thee
are
impotent
things
for
none
can
express
thee
though
all
should
approve
thee
i
love
thee
so
dear
that
i
only
can
love
thee
ii
say
what
can
i
do
for
thee
weary
thee
grieve
thee
lean
on
thy
shoulder
new
burdens
to
add
weep
my
tears
over
thee
making
thee
sad
oh
hold
me
not
love
me
not
let
me
retrieve
thee
i
love
thee
so
dear
that
i
only
can
leave
thee
sonnets
from
the
portuguese
i
thought
once
how
theocritus
had
sung
of
the
sweet
years
the
dear
and
years
who
each
one
in
a
gracious
hand
appears
to
bear
a
gift
for
mortals
old
or
young
and
as
i
mused
it
in
his
antique
tongue
i
saw
in
gradual
vision
through
my
tears
the
sweet
sad
years
the
melancholy
years
those
of
my
own
life
who
by
turns
had
flung
a
shadow
across
me
straightway
i
was
so
weeping
how
a
mystic
shape
did
move
behind
me
and
drew
me
backward
by
the
hair
and
a
voice
said
in
mastery
while
i
strove
guess
now
who
holds
thee
death
i
said
but
there
the
silver
answer
rang
not
death
but
love
ii
but
only
three
in
all
god
universe
have
heard
this
word
thou
hast
said
himself
beside
thee
speaking
and
me
listening
and
replied
one
of
us
was
god
and
laid
the
curse
so
darkly
on
my
eyelids
as
to
amerce
my
sight
from
seeing
thee
that
if
i
had
died
the
deathweights
placed
there
would
have
signified
less
absolute
exclusion
nay
is
worse
from
god
than
from
all
others
o
my
friend
men
could
not
part
us
with
their
worldly
jars
nor
the
seas
change
us
nor
the
tempests
bend
our
hands
would
touch
for
all
the
and
heaven
being
rolled
between
us
at
the
end
we
should
but
vow
the
faster
for
the
stars
iii
unlike
are
we
unlike
o
princely
heart
unlike
our
uses
and
our
destinies
our
ministering
two
angels
look
surprise
on
one
another
as
they
strike
athwart
their
wings
in
passing
thou
bethink
thee
art
a
guest
for
queens
to
social
pageantries
with
gages
from
a
hundred
brighter
eyes
than
tears
even
can
make
mine
to
play
thy
part
of
chief
musician
what
hast
to
do
with
looking
from
the
at
me
a
poor
tired
wandering
singer
singing
through
the
dark
and
leaning
up
a
cypress
tree
the
chrism
is
on
thine
head
on
mine
the
dew
and
death
must
dig
the
level
where
these
agree
iv
thou
hast
thy
calling
to
some
most
gracious
singer
of
high
poems
where
the
dancers
will
break
footing
from
the
care
of
watching
up
thy
pregnant
lips
for
more
and
dost
thou
lift
this
house
latch
too
poor
for
hand
of
thine
and
canst
thou
think
and
bear
to
let
thy
music
drop
here
unaware
in
folds
of
golden
fulness
at
my
door
look
up
and
see
the
casement
broken
in
the
bats
and
owlets
builders
in
the
roof
my
cricket
chirps
against
thy
mandolin
hush
call
no
echo
up
in
further
proof
of
desolation
there
a
voice
within
that
weeps
as
thou
must
sing
alone
aloof
i
lift
my
heavy
heart
up
solemnly
as
once
electra
her
sepulchral
urn
and
looking
in
thine
eyes
i
overturn
the
ashes
at
thy
feet
behold
and
see
what
a
great
heap
of
grief
lay
hid
in
me
and
how
the
red
wild
sparkles
dimly
burn
through
the
ashen
greyness
if
thy
foot
in
scorn
could
tread
them
out
to
darkness
utterly
it
might
be
well
perhaps
but
if
instead
thou
wait
beside
me
for
the
wind
to
blow
the
grey
dust
up
those
laurels
on
thine
head
o
my
belovèd
will
not
shield
thee
so
that
none
of
all
the
fires
shall
scorch
and
shred
the
hair
beneath
stand
further
off
then
go
vi
go
from
me
yet
i
feel
that
i
shall
stand
henceforward
in
thy
shadow
nevermore
alone
upon
the
threshold
of
my
door
of
individual
life
i
shall
command
the
uses
of
my
soul
nor
lift
my
hand
serenely
in
the
sunshine
as
before
without
the
sense
of
that
which
i
forbore
thy
touch
upon
the
palm
the
widest
land
doom
takes
to
part
us
leaves
thy
heart
in
mine
with
pulses
that
beat
double
what
i
do
and
what
i
dream
include
thee
as
the
wine
must
taste
of
its
own
grapes
and
when
i
sue
god
for
myself
he
hears
that
name
of
thine
and
sees
within
my
eyes
the
tears
of
two
vii
the
face
of
all
the
world
is
changed
i
think
since
first
i
heard
the
footsteps
of
thy
soul
move
still
oh
still
beside
me
as
they
stole
betwixt
me
and
the
dreadful
outer
brink
of
obvious
death
where
i
who
thought
to
sink
was
caught
up
into
love
and
taught
the
whole
of
life
in
a
new
rhythm
the
cup
of
dole
god
gave
for
baptism
i
am
fain
to
drink
and
praise
its
sweetness
sweet
with
thee
anear
the
names
of
country
heaven
are
changed
away
for
where
thou
art
or
shalt
be
there
or
here
and
this
this
lute
and
song
loved
yesterday
the
singing
angels
know
are
only
dear
because
thy
name
moves
right
in
what
they
say
viii
what
can
i
give
thee
back
o
liberal
and
princely
giver
who
hast
brought
the
gold
and
purple
of
thine
heart
unstained
untold
and
laid
them
on
the
outside
of
the
wall
for
such
as
i
to
take
or
leave
withal
in
unexpected
largesse
am
i
cold
ungrateful
that
for
these
most
manifold
high
gifts
i
render
nothing
back
at
all
not
so
not
cold
but
very
poor
instead
ask
god
who
knows
for
frequent
tears
have
run
the
colours
from
my
life
and
left
so
dead
and
pale
a
stuff
it
were
not
fitly
done
to
give
the
same
as
pillow
to
thy
head
go
farther
let
it
serve
to
trample
on
ix
can
it
be
right
to
give
what
i
can
give
to
let
thee
sit
beneath
the
fall
of
tears
as
salt
as
mine
and
hear
the
sighing
years
on
my
lips
renunciative
through
those
infrequent
smiles
which
fail
to
live
for
all
thy
adjurations
o
my
fears
that
this
can
scarce
be
right
we
are
not
peers
so
to
be
lovers
and
i
own
and
grieve
that
givers
of
such
gifts
as
mine
are
must
be
counted
with
the
ungenerous
out
alas
i
will
not
soil
thy
purple
with
my
dust
nor
breathe
my
poison
on
thy
nor
give
thee
any
love
which
were
unjust
beloved
i
only
love
thee
let
it
pass
x
yet
love
mere
love
is
beautiful
indeed
and
worthy
of
acceptation
fire
is
bright
let
temple
burn
or
flax
an
equal
light
leaps
in
the
flame
from
or
weed
and
love
is
fire
and
when
i
say
at
need
love
mark
love
in
thy
sight
i
stand
transfigured
glorified
aright
with
conscience
of
the
new
rays
that
proceed
out
of
my
face
toward
thine
there
nothing
low
in
love
when
love
the
lowest
meanest
creatures
who
love
god
god
accepts
while
loving
so
and
what
i
across
the
inferior
features
of
what
i
doth
flash
itself
and
show
how
that
great
work
of
love
enhances
nature
xi
and
therefore
if
to
love
can
be
desert
i
am
not
all
unworthy
cheeks
as
pale
as
these
you
see
and
trembling
knees
that
fail
to
bear
the
burden
of
a
heavy
heart
this
weary
that
once
was
girt
to
climb
aornus
and
can
scarce
avail
to
pipe
now
the
valley
nightingale
a
melancholy
music
why
advert
to
these
things
o
belovèd
it
is
plain
i
am
not
of
thy
worth
nor
for
thy
place
and
yet
because
i
love
thee
i
obtain
from
that
same
love
this
vindicating
grace
to
live
on
still
in
love
and
yet
in
vain
to
bless
thee
yet
renounce
thee
to
thy
face
xii
indeed
this
very
love
which
is
my
boast
and
which
when
rising
up
from
breast
to
brow
doth
crown
me
with
a
ruby
large
enow
to
draw
men
eyes
and
prove
the
inner
cost
this
love
even
all
my
worth
to
the
uttermost
i
should
not
love
withal
unless
that
thou
hadst
set
me
an
example
shown
me
how
when
first
thine
earnest
eyes
with
mine
were
crossed
and
love
called
love
and
thus
i
can
not
speak
of
love
even
as
a
good
thing
of
my
own
thy
soul
hath
snatched
up
mine
all
faint
and
weak
and
placed
it
by
thee
on
a
golden
throne
and
that
i
love
o
soul
we
must
be
meek
is
by
thee
only
whom
i
love
alone
xiii
and
wilt
thou
have
me
fashion
into
speech
the
love
i
bear
thee
finding
words
enough
and
hold
the
torch
out
while
the
winds
are
rough
between
our
faces
to
cast
light
on
each
i
drop
it
at
thy
feet
i
can
not
teach
my
hand
to
hold
my
spirit
so
far
off
from
myself
me
that
i
should
bring
thee
proof
in
words
of
love
hid
in
me
out
of
reach
nay
let
the
silence
of
my
womanhood
commend
my
to
thy
belief
seeing
that
i
stand
unwon
however
wooed
and
rend
the
garment
of
my
life
in
brief
by
a
most
dauntless
voiceless
fortitude
lest
one
touch
of
this
heart
convey
its
grief
xiv
if
thou
must
love
me
let
it
be
for
nought
except
for
love
sake
only
do
not
say
i
love
her
for
her
smile
her
look
her
way
of
speaking
gently
for
a
trick
of
thought
that
falls
in
well
with
mine
and
certes
brought
a
sense
of
pleasant
ease
on
such
a
day
for
these
things
in
themselves
belovèd
may
be
changed
or
change
for
thee
and
love
so
wrought
may
be
unwrought
so
neither
love
me
for
thine
own
dear
pity
wiping
my
cheeks
dry
a
creature
might
forget
to
weep
who
bore
thy
comfort
long
and
lose
thy
love
thereby
but
love
me
for
love
sake
that
evermore
thou
mayst
love
on
through
love
eternity
xv
accuse
me
not
beseech
thee
that
i
wear
too
calm
and
sad
a
face
in
front
of
thine
for
we
two
look
two
ways
and
can
not
shine
with
the
same
sunlight
on
our
brow
and
hair
on
me
thou
lookest
with
no
doubting
care
as
on
a
bee
shut
in
a
crystalline
since
sorrow
hath
shut
me
safe
in
love
divine
and
to
spread
wing
and
fly
in
the
outer
air
were
most
impossible
failure
if
i
strove
to
fail
so
but
i
look
on
thee
on
thee
beholding
besides
love
the
end
of
love
hearing
oblivion
beyond
memory
as
one
who
sits
and
gazes
from
above
over
the
rivers
to
the
bitter
sea
xvi
and
yet
because
thou
overcomest
so
because
thou
art
more
noble
and
like
a
king
thou
canst
prevail
against
my
fears
and
fling
thy
purple
round
me
till
my
heart
shall
grow
too
close
against
thine
heart
henceforth
to
know
how
it
shook
when
alone
why
conquering
may
prove
as
lordly
and
complete
a
thing
in
lifting
upward
as
in
crushing
low
and
as
a
vanquished
soldier
yields
his
sword
to
one
who
lifts
him
from
the
bloody
earth
even
so
belovèd
i
at
last
record
here
ends
my
strife
if
invite
me
forth
i
rise
above
abasement
at
the
word
make
thy
love
larger
to
enlarge
my
worth
xvii
my
poet
thou
canst
touch
on
all
the
notes
god
set
between
his
after
and
before
and
strike
up
and
strike
off
the
general
roar
of
the
rushing
worlds
a
melody
that
floats
in
a
serene
air
purely
antidotes
of
medicated
music
answering
for
mankind
forlornest
uses
thou
canst
pour
from
thence
into
their
ears
god
will
devotes
thine
to
such
ends
and
mine
to
wait
on
thine
how
dearest
wilt
thou
have
me
for
most
use
a
hope
to
sing
by
gladly
or
a
fine
sad
memory
with
thy
songs
to
interfuse
a
shade
in
which
to
sing
of
palm
or
pine
a
grave
on
which
to
rest
from
singing
choose
xviii
i
never
gave
a
lock
of
hair
away
to
a
man
dearest
except
this
to
thee
which
now
upon
my
fingers
thoughtfully
i
ring
out
to
the
full
brown
length
and
say
take
it
my
day
of
youth
went
yesterday
my
hair
no
longer
bounds
to
my
foot
glee
nor
plant
i
it
from
rose
or
as
girls
do
any
more
it
only
may
now
shade
on
two
pale
cheeks
the
mark
of
tears
taught
drooping
from
the
head
that
hangs
aside
through
sorrow
trick
i
thought
the
would
take
this
first
but
love
is
justified
take
it
thou
finding
pure
from
all
those
years
the
kiss
my
mother
left
here
when
she
died
xix
the
soul
rialto
hath
its
merchandise
i
barter
curl
for
curl
upon
that
mart
and
from
my
poet
forehead
to
my
heart
receive
this
lock
which
outweighs
argosies
as
purply
black
as
erst
to
pindar
eyes
the
dim
purpureal
tresses
gloomed
athwart
the
nine
white
for
this
counterpart
the
shade
belovèd
i
surmise
still
lingers
on
thy
curl
it
is
so
black
thus
with
a
fillet
of
breath
i
tie
the
shadows
safe
from
gliding
back
and
lay
the
gift
where
nothing
hindereth
here
on
my
heart
as
on
thy
brow
to
lack
no
natural
heat
till
mine
grows
cold
in
death
xx
beloved
my
belovèd
when
i
think
that
thou
wast
in
the
world
a
year
ago
what
time
i
sat
alone
here
in
the
snow
and
saw
no
footprint
heard
the
silence
sink
no
moment
at
thy
voice
but
link
by
link
went
counting
all
my
chains
as
if
that
so
they
never
could
fall
off
at
any
blow
struck
by
thy
possible
hand
why
thus
i
drink
of
life
great
cup
of
wonder
wonderful
never
to
feel
thee
thrill
the
day
or
night
with
personal
act
or
speech
nor
ever
cull
some
prescience
of
thee
with
the
blossoms
white
thou
sawest
growing
atheists
are
as
dull
who
can
not
guess
god
presence
out
of
sight
xxi
say
over
again
and
yet
once
over
again
that
thou
dost
love
me
though
the
word
repeated
should
seem
a
as
thou
dost
treat
it
remember
never
to
the
hill
or
plain
valley
and
wood
without
her
comes
the
fresh
spring
in
all
her
green
completed
belovèd
i
amid
the
darkness
greeted
by
a
doubtful
in
that
doubt
pain
cry
speak
once
more
thou
lovest
who
can
fear
too
many
stars
though
each
in
heaven
shall
roll
too
many
flowers
though
each
shall
crown
the
year

thou
dost
love
me
love
me
love
me
toll
the
silver
iterance
only
minding
dear
to
love
me
also
in
silence
with
thy
soul
xxii
when
our
two
souls
stand
up
erect
and
strong
face
to
face
silent
drawing
nigh
and
nigher
until
the
lengthening
wings
break
into
fire
at
either
curvèd
point
what
bitter
wrong
can
the
earth
do
to
us
that
we
should
not
long
be
here
contented
think
in
mounting
higher
the
angels
would
press
on
us
and
aspire
to
drop
some
golden
orb
of
perfect
song
into
our
deep
dear
silence
let
us
stay
rather
on
earth
belovèd
where
the
unfit
contrarious
moods
of
men
recoil
away
and
isolate
pure
spirits
and
permit
a
place
to
stand
and
love
in
for
a
day
with
darkness
and
the
rounding
it
xxiii
is
it
indeed
so
if
i
lay
here
dead
wouldst
thou
miss
any
life
in
losing
mine
and
would
the
sun
for
thee
more
coldly
shine
because
of
falling
round
my
head
i
marvelled
my
belovèd
when
i
read
thy
thought
so
in
the
letter
i
am
thine
but
much
to
thee
can
i
pour
thy
wine
while
my
hands
tremble
then
my
soul
instead
of
dreams
of
death
resumes
life
lower
range
then
love
me
love
look
on
me
breathe
on
me
as
brighter
ladies
do
not
count
it
strange
for
love
to
give
up
acres
and
degree
i
yield
the
grave
for
thy
sake
and
exchange
my
near
sweet
view
of
heaven
for
earth
with
thee
xxiv
let
the
world
sharpness
like
a
clasping
knife
shut
in
upon
itself
and
do
no
harm
in
this
close
hand
of
love
now
soft
and
warm
and
let
us
hear
no
sound
of
human
strife
after
the
click
of
the
shutting
life
to
life
i
lean
upon
thee
dear
without
alarm
and
feel
as
safe
as
guarded
by
a
charm
against
the
stab
of
worldlings
who
if
rife
are
weak
to
injure
still
the
lilies
of
our
lives
may
reassure
their
blossoms
from
their
roots
accessible
alone
to
heavenly
dews
that

not

growing
straight
out
of

xxv
a
heavy
heart
belovèd
have
i
borne
from
year
to
year
until
i
saw
thy
face
and
sorrow
after
sorrow
took
the
place
of
all
those
natural
joys
as
lightly
worn
as
the
stringed
pearls
each
lifted
in
its
turn
by
a
beating
heart
at
hopes
apace
were
changed
to
long
despairs
till
god
own
grace
could
scarcely
lift
above
the
world
forlorn
my
heavy
heart
then
didst
bid
me
bring
and
let
it
drop
adown
thy
calmly
great
deep
being
fast
it
sinketh
as
a
thing
which
its
own
nature
doth
precipitate
while
thine
doth
close
above
it
mediating
betwixt
the
stars
and
the
unaccomplished
fate
xxvi
i
lived
with
visions
for
my
company
instead
of
men
and
women
years
ago
and
found
them
gentle
mates
nor
thought
to
know
a
sweeter
music
than
they
played
to
me
but
soon
their
trailing
purple
was
not
free
of
this
world
dust
their
lutes
did
silent
grow
and
i
myself
grew
faint
and
blind
below
their
vanishing
eyes
then
thou
didst
come
to
be
belovèd
what
they
seemed
their
shining
fronts
their
songs
their
splendours
better
yet
the
same
as
hallowed
into
fonts
met
in
thee
and
from
out
thee
overcame
my
soul
with
satisfaction
of
all
wants
because
god
gifts
put
man
best
dreams
to
shame
xxvii
my
own
belovèd
who
hast
lifted
me
from
this
drear
flat
of
earth
where
i
was
thrown
and
in
betwixt
the
languid
ringlets
blown
a
till
the
forehead
hopefully
shines
out
again
as
all
the
angels
see
before
thy
saving
kiss
my
own
my
own
who
camest
to
me
when
the
world
was
gone
and
i
who
looked
for
only
god
found
i
find
thee
i
am
safe
and
strong
and
glad
as
one
who
stands
in
dewless
asphodel
looks
backward
on
the
tedious
time
he
had
in
the
upper
life
so
i
with
make
witness
here
between
the
good
and
bad
that
love
as
strong
as
death
retrieves
as
well
xxviii
my
letters
all
dead
paper
mute
and
white
and
yet
they
seem
alive
and
quivering
against
my
tremulous
hands
which
loose
the
string
and
let
them
drop
down
on
my
knee
this
said
he
wished
to
have
me
in
his
sight
once
as
a
friend
this
fixed
a
day
in
spring
to
come
and
touch
my
hand
a
simple
thing
yet
i
wept
for
it
this
the
paper
light
said
i
love
and
i
sank
and
quailed
as
if
god
future
thundered
on
my
past
this
said
am
and
so
its
ink
has
paled
with
lying
at
my
heart
that
beat
too
fast
and
this
o
love
thy
words
have
ill
availed
if
what
this
said
i
dared
repeat
at
last
xxix
i
think
of
thee
my
thoughts
do
twine
and
bud
about
thee
as
wild
vines
about
a
tree
put
out
broad
leaves
and
soon
there
nought
to
see
except
the
straggling
green
which
hides
the
wood
yet
o
my
be
it
understood
i
will
not
have
my
thoughts
instead
of
thee
who
art
dearer
better
rather
instantly
renew
thy
presence
as
a
strong
tree
should
rustle
thy
boughs
and
set
thy
trunk
all
bare
and
let
these
bands
of
greenery
which
insphere
thee
drop
heavily
down
burst
shattered
everywhere
because
in
this
deep
joy
to
see
and
hear
thee
and
breathe
within
thy
shadow
a
new
air
i
do
not
think
of
thee
i
am
too
near
thee
xxx
i
see
thine
image
through
my
tears
and
yet
i
saw
thee
smiling
how
refer
the
cause
belovèd
is
it
thou
or
i
who
makes
me
sad
the
acolyte
amid
the
chanted
joy
and
thankful
rite
may
so
fall
flat
with
pale
insensate
brow
on
the
i
hear
thy
voice
and
vow
perplexed
uncertain
since
thou
art
out
of
sight
as
he
in
his
swooning
ears
the
choir
amen
belovèd
dost
thou
love
or
did
i
see
all
the
glory
as
i
dreamed
and
fainted
when
too
vehement
light
dilated
my
ideal
for
my
soul
eyes
will
that
light
come
again
as
now
these
tears
come
falling
hot
and
real
xxxi
thou
comest
all
is
said
without
a
word
i
sit
beneath
thy
looks
as
children
do
in
the
with
souls
that
tremble
through
their
happy
eyelids
from
an
unaverred
yet
prodigal
inward
joy
behold
i
erred
in
that
last
doubt
and
yet
i
can
not
rue
the
sin
most
but
the
occasion
that
we
two
should
for
a
moment
stand
unministered
by
a
mutual
presence
ah
keep
near
and
close
thou
dovelike
help
and
when
my
fears
would
rise
with
thy
broad
heart
serenely
interpose
brood
down
with
thy
divine
sufficiencies
these
thoughts
which
tremble
when
bereft
of
those
like
callow
birds
left
desert
to
the
skies
xxxii
the
first
time
that
the
sun
rose
on
thine
oath
to
love
me
i
looked
forward
to
the
moon
to
slacken
all
those
bonds
which
seemed
too
soon
and
quickly
tied
to
make
a
lasting
troth
hearts
i
thought
may
quickly
loathe
and
looking
on
myself
i
seemed
not
one
for
such
man
love
more
like
an
worn
viol
a
good
singer
would
be
wroth
to
spoil
his
song
with
and
which
snatched
in
haste
is
laid
down
at
the
first
note
i
did
not
wrong
myself
so
but
i
placed
a
wrong
on
for
perfect
strains
may
float
from
instruments
defaced
and
great
souls
at
one
stroke
may
do
and
doat
xxxiii
yes
call
me
by
my
let
me
hear
the
name
i
used
to
run
at
when
a
child
from
innocent
play
and
leave
the
cowslips
piled
to
glance
up
in
some
face
that
proved
me
dear
with
the
look
of
its
eyes
i
miss
the
clear
fond
voices
which
being
drawn
and
reconciled
into
the
music
of
heaven
undefiled
call
me
no
longer
silence
on
the
bier
while
i
call
god
call
god
so
let
thy
mouth
be
heir
to
those
who
are
now
exanimate
gather
the
north
flowers
to
complete
the
south
and
catch
the
early
love
up
in
the
late
yes
call
me
by
that
name
and
i
in
truth
with
the
same
heart
will
answer
and
not
wait
xxxiv
with
the
same
heart
i
said
i
answer
thee
as
those
when
thou
shalt
call
me
by
my
name
lo
the
vain
promise
is
the
same
the
same
perplexed
and
ruffled
by
life
strategy
when
called
before
i
told
how
hastily
i
dropped
my
flowers
or
brake
off
from
a
game
to
run
and
answer
with
the
smile
that
came
at
play
last
moment
and
went
on
with
me
through
my
obedience
when
i
answer
now
i
drop
a
grave
thought
break
from
solitude
yet
still
my
heart
goes
to
thee
ponder
how
not
as
to
a
single
good
but
all
my
good
lay
thy
hand
on
it
best
one
and
allow
that
no
child
foot
could
run
fast
as
this
blood
xxxv
if
i
leave
all
for
thee
wilt
thou
exchange
and
be
all
to
me
shall
i
never
miss
and
blessing
and
the
common
kiss
that
comes
to
each
in
turn
nor
count
it
strange
when
i
look
up
to
drop
on
a
new
range
of
walls
and
floors
another
home
than
this
nay
wilt
thou
fill
that
place
by
me
which
is
filled
by
dead
eyes
too
tender
to
know
change
that
hardest
if
to
conquer
love
has
tried
to
conquer
grief
tries
more
as
all
things
prove
for
grief
indeed
is
love
and
grief
beside
alas
i
have
grieved
so
i
am
hard
to
love
yet
love
me
wilt
thou
open
thine
heart
wide
and
fold
within
the
wet
wings
of
thy
dove
xxxvi
when
we
met
first
and
loved
i
did
not
build
upon
the
event
with
marble
could
it
mean
to
last
a
love
set
pendulous
between
sorrow
and
sorrow
nay
i
rather
thrilled
distrusting
every
light
that
seemed
to
gild
the
onward
path
and
feared
to
overlean
a
finger
even
and
though
i
have
grown
serene
and
strong
since
then
i
think
that
god
has
willed
a
still
renewable
fear
o
love
o
troth
lest
these
enclaspèd
hands
should
never
hold
this
mutual
kiss
drop
down
between
us
both
as
an
unowned
thing
once
the
lips
being
cold
and
love
be
false
if
to
keep
one
oath
must
lose
one
joy
by
his
life
star
foretold
xxxvii
pardon
oh
pardon
that
my
soul
should
make
of
all
that
strong
divineness
which
i
know
for
thine
and
thee
an
image
only
so
formed
of
the
sand
and
fit
to
shift
and
break
it
is
that
distant
years
which
did
not
take
thy
sovranty
recoiling
with
a
blow
have
forced
my
swimming
brain
to
undergo
their
doubt
and
dread
and
blindly
to
forsake
thy
purity
of
likeness
and
distort
thy
worthiest
love
to
a
worthless
counterfeit
as
if
a
shipwrecked
pagan
safe
in
port
his
guardian
to
commemorate
should
set
a
sculptured
porpoise
gills
and
vibrant
tail
within
the
xxxviii
first
time
he
kissed
me
he
but
only
kissed
the
fingers
of
this
hand
wherewith
i
write
and
ever
since
it
grew
more
clean
and
white
slow
to
quick
with
its
oh
list
when
the
angels
speak
a
ring
of
amethyst
i
could
not
wear
here
plainer
to
my
sight
than
that
first
kiss
the
second
passed
in
height
the
first
and
sought
the
forehead
and
half
missed
half
falling
on
the
hair
o
beyond
meed
that
was
the
chrism
of
love
which
love
own
crown
with
sanctifying
sweetness
did
precede
the
third
upon
my
lips
was
folded
down
in
perfect
purple
state
since
when
indeed
i
have
been
proud
and
said
my
love
my
own
xxxix
because
thou
hast
the
power
and
the
grace
to
look
through
and
behind
this
mask
of
me
against
which
years
have
beat
thus
blanchingly
with
their
rains
and
behold
my
soul
true
face
the
dim
and
weary
witness
of
life
race
because
thou
hast
the
faith
and
love
to
see
through
that
same
soul
distracting
lethargy
the
patient
angel
waiting
for
a
place
in
the
new
heavens
because
nor
sin
nor
woe
nor
god
infliction
nor
death
neighbourhood
nor
all
which
others
viewing
turn
to
go
nor
all
which
makes
me
tired
of
all
nothing
repels
thee

teach
me
so
to
pour
out
gratitude
as
thou
dost

xl
oh
yes
they
love
through
all
this
world
of
ours
i
will
not
gainsay
love
called
love
forsooth
i
have
heard
love
talked
in
my
early
youth
and
since
not
so
long
back
but
that
the
flowers
then
gathered
smell
still
mussulmans
and
giaours
throw
kerchiefs
at
a
smile
and
have
no
ruth
for
any
weeping
polypheme
white
tooth
slips
on
the
nut
if
after
frequent
showers
the
shell
is
and
not
so
much
will
turn
the
thing
called
love
aside
to
hate
or
else
to
oblivion
but
thou
art
not
such
a
lover
my
belovèd
thou
canst
wait
through
sorrow
and
sickness
to
bring
souls
to
touch
and
think
it
soon
when
others
cry
too
late
xli
i
thank
all
who
have
loved
me
in
their
hearts
with
thanks
and
love
from
mine
deep
thanks
to
all
who
paused
a
little
near
the
to
hear
my
music
in
its
louder
parts
ere
they
went
onward
each
one
to
the
or
temple
occupation
beyond
call
but
thou
who
in
my
voice
sink
and
fall
when
the
sob
took
it
thy
divinest
own
instrument
didst
drop
down
at
thy
foot
to
hearken
what
i
said
between
my
tears
instruct
me
how
to
thank
thee
oh
to
shoot
my
soul
full
meaning
into
future
years
that
should
lend
it
utterance
and
salute
love
that
endures
from
life
that
disappears
xlii
future
will
not
copy
fair
my
i
wrote
that
once
and
thinking
at
my
side
my
ministering
justified
the
word
by
his
appealing
look
upcast
to
the
white
throne
of
god
i
turned
at
last
and
there
instead
saw
thee
not
unallied
to
angels
in
thy
soul
then
i
long
tried
by
natural
ills
received
the
comfort
fast
while
budding
at
thy
sight
my
pilgrim
staff
gave
out
green
leaves
with
morning
dews
impearled
i
seek
no
copy
now
of
life
first
half
leave
here
the
pages
with
long
musing
curled
and
write
me

how
do
i
love
thee
let
me
count
the
ways
i
love
thee
to
the
depth
and
breadth
and
height
my
soul
can
reach
when
feeling
out
of
sight
for
the
ends
of
being
and
ideal
grace
i
love
thee
to
the
level
of
most
quiet
need
by
sun
and
candlelight
i
love
thee
freely
as
men
strive
for
right
i
love
thee
purely
as
they
turn
from
praise
i
love
thee
with
the
passion
put
to
use
in
my
old
griefs
and
with
my
childhood
faith
i
love
thee
with
a
love
i
seemed
to
lose
with
my
lost
saints
i
love
thee
with
the
breath
smiles
tears
of
all
my
life
and
if
god
choose
i
shall
but
love
thee
better
after
death
xliv
belovèd
thou
hast
brought
me
many
flowers
plucked
in
the
garden
all
the
summer
through
and
winter
and
it
seemed
as
if
they
grew
in
this
close
room
nor
missed
the
sun
and
showers
so
in
the
like
name
of
that
love
of
ours
take
back
these
thoughts
which
here
unfolded
too
and
which
on
warm
and
cold
days
i
withdrew
from
my
heart
ground
indeed
those
beds
and
bowers
be
overgrown
with
bitter
weeds
and
rue
and
wait
thy
weeding
yet
here
eglantine
here

take
them
as
i
used
to
do
thy
flowers
and
keep
them
where
they
shall
not
pine
instruct
thine
eyes
to
keep
their
colours
true
and
tell
thy

their

a
poem
in
two
parts
advertisement
to
the
first
edition
this
poem
contains
the
impressions
of
the
writer
upon
events
in
tuscany
of
which
she
was
a
witness
from
a
window
the
critic
may
demur
she
bows
to
the
objection
in
the
very
title
of
her
work
no
continuous
narrative
nor
exposition
of
political
philosophy
is
attempted
by
her
it
is
a
simple
story
of
personal
impressions
whose
only
value
is
in
the
intensity
with
which
they
were
received
as
proving
her
warm
affection
for
a
beautiful
and
unfortunate
country
and
the
sincerity
with
which
they
are
related
as
indicating
her
own
good
faith
and
freedom
from
partisanship
of
the
two
parts
of
this
poem
the
first
was
written
nearly
three
years
ago
while
the
second
resumes
the
actual
situation
of
the
discrepancy
between
the
two
parts
is
a
sufficient
guarantee
to
the
public
of
the
truthfulness
of
the
writer
who
though
she
certainly
escaped
the
epidemic
falling
sickness
of
enthusiasm
for

takes
shame
upon

she
believed
like

some

to
the

let
him

to

such
discrepancies
we
are
called
upon
to
accept
at

by

the

florence

part
i
heard
last
night
a
little
child
go
singing
casa
guidi
windows
by
the
church
bella
libertà
o
bella
stringing
the
same
words
still
on
notes
he
went
in
search
so
high
for
you
concluded
the
upspringing
of
such
a
nimble
bird
to
sky
from
perch
must
leave
the
whole
bush
in
a
tremble
green
and
that
the
heart
of
italy
must
beat
while
such
a
voice
had
leave
to
rise
serene
church
and
palace
of
a
florence
street
a
little
child
too
who
not
long
had
been
by
mother
finger
steadied
on
his
feet
and
still
bella
he
sang
then
i
thought
musing
of
the
innumerous
sweet
songs
which
still
for
italy
outrang
from
older
singers
lips
who
sang
not
thus
exultingly
and
purely
yet
with
pang
fast
sheathed
in
music
touched
the
heart
of
us
so
finely
that
the
pity
scarcely
pained
i
thought
how
filicaja
led
on
others
bewailers
for
their
italy
enchained
and
how
they
called
her
childless
among
mothers
widow
of
empires
ay
and
scarce
refrained
cursing
her
beauty
to
her
face
as
brothers
might
a
shamed
sister
had
she
been
less
fair
she
were
less
wretched
how
evoking
so
from
congregated
wrong
and
heaped
despair
of
men
and
women
writhing
under
blow
harrowed
and
hideous
in
a
filthy
lair
some
personating
image
wherein
woe
was
wrapt
in
beauty
from
offending
much
they
called
it
cybele
or
niobe
or
laid
it
on
a
bier
for
such
where
all
the
world
might
drop
for
italy
those
cadenced
tears
which
burn
not
where
they
touch
juliet
of
nations
canst
thou
die
as
we
and
was
the
violet
crown
that
crowned
thy
head
so
though
new
buds
made
it
rough
it
slipped
down
and
across
thine
eyelids
dead
o
sweet
fair
juliet
of
such
songs
enough
too
many
of
such
complaints
behold
instead
void
at
verona

trough
as
void
as
that
is
are
all
images
men
set
between
themselves
and
actual
wrong
to
catch
the
weight
of
pity
meet
the
stress
of
conscience
since
is
easier
to
gaze
long
on
mournful
masks
and
sad
effigies
than
on
real
live
weak
creatures
crushed
by
strong
for
me
who
stand
in
italy
where
worthier
poets
stood
and
sang
before
i
kiss
their
footsteps
yet
their
words
gainsay
i
can
but
muse
in
hope
upon
this
shore
of
golden
arno
as
it
shoots
away
through
florence
heart
beneath
her
bridges
four
bent
bridges
seeming
to
strain
off
like
bows
and
tremble
while
the
arrowy
undertide
shoots
on
and
cleaves
the
marble
as
it
goes
and
strikes
up
on
either
side
and
froths
the
cornice
out
in
glittering
rows
with
doors
and
windows
quaintly
multiplied
and
and
gazers
upon
all
by
whom
if
flower
or
kerchief
were
thrown
out
from
any
lattice
there
the
same
would
fall
into
the
river
underneath
no
doubt
it
runs
so
close
and
fast
wall
and
wall
how
beautiful
the
mountains
from
without
in
silence
listen
for
the
word
said
next
what
word
will
men
say
here
where
giotto
planted
his
campanile
like
an
unperplexed
fine
question
heavenward
touching
the
things
granted
a
noble
people
who
being
greatly
vexed
in
act
in
aspiration
keep
undaunted
what
word
will
god
say
michel
night
and
day
and
dawn
and
twilight
wait
in
marble
scorn
like
dogs
upon
a
dunghill
couched
on
clay
from
whence
the
medicean
stamp
outworn
the
final
putting
off
of
all
such
sway
by
all
such
hands
and
freeing
of
the
unborn
in
florence
and
the
great
world
outside
florence
three
hundred
years
his
patient
statues
wait
in
that
small
chapel
of
the
dim
saint
lawrence
day
eyes
are
breaking
bold
and
passionate
over
his
shoulder
and
will
flash
abhorrence
on
darkness
and
with
level
looks
meet
fate
when
once
loose
from
that
marble
film
of
theirs
the
night
has
wild
dreams
in
her
sleep
the
dawn
is
haggard
as
the
sleepless
twilight
wears
a
sort
of
horror
as
the
veil
withdrawn
the
artist
soul
and
works
had
left
them
heirs
of
speechless
thoughts
which
would
not
quail
nor
fawn
of
angers
and
contempts
of
hope
and
love
for
not
without
a
meaning
did
he
place
the
princely
urbino
on
the
seat
above
with
everlasting
shadow
on
his
face
while
the
slow
dawns
and
twilights
disapprove
the
ashes
of
his
race
which
never
more
shall
clog
the
feet
of
men
i
do
believe
divinest
angelo
that
in
via
larga
when
they
bade
thee
build
a
statue
up
in
snow
and
straight
that
marvel
of
thine
art
again
dissolved
beneath
the
sun
italian
glow
thine
eyes
dilated
with
the
plastic
passion
thawing
too
in
drops
of
wounded
manhood
since
to
mock
alike
thine
art
and
indignation
laughed
at
the
the
new
prince
aha
this
genius
needs
for
exaltation
when
all
said
and
however
the
proud
may
wince
a
little
marble
from
our
princely
mines
i
do
believe
that
hour
thou
laughedst
too
for
the
whole
sad
world
and
for
thy
florentines
after
those
few
tears
which
were
only
few
that
as
beneath
the
sun
the
grand
white
lines
of
thy
trembled
and
withdrew
the
head
erect
as
jove
being
palsied
first
the
eyelids
flattened
the
full
brow
turned
blank
the
raised
but
now
as
if
it
cursed
dropt
a
mere
snowball
till
the
people
sank
their
voices
though
a
louder
laughter
burst
from
the
royal
window
thou
couldst
proudly
thank
god
and
the
prince
for
promise
and
presage
and
laugh
the
laugh
back
i
think
verily
thine
eyes
being
purged
by
tears
of
righteous
rage
to
read
a
wrong
into
a
prophecy
and
measure
a
true
great
man
heritage
against
a
mere
posterity
i
think
thy
soul
said
then
i
do
not
need
a
princedom
and
its
quarries
after
all
for
if
i
write
paint
carve
a
word
indeed
on
book
or
board
or
dust
on
floor
or
wall
the
same
is
kept
of
god
who
taketh
heed
that
not
a
letter
of
the
meaning
fall
or
ere
it
touch
and
teach
his
world
deep
heart
outlasting
therefore
all
your
lordships
sir
so
keep
your
stone
beseech
you
for
your
part
to
cover
up
your
and
refer
the
proper
titles
live
by
my
art
the
thought
i
threw
into
this
snow
shall
stir
this
gazing
people
when
their
gaze
is
done
and
the
tradition
of
your
act
and
mine
when
all
the
snow
is
melted
in
the
sun
shall
gather
up
for
unborn
men
a
sign
of
what
is
the
true
princedom
ay
and
none
shall
laugh
that
day
except
the
drunk
with
wine
amen
great
angelo
the
day
at
hand
if
many
laugh
not
on
it
shall
we
weep
much
more
we
must
not
let
us
understand
through
rhymers
sonneteering
in
their
sleep
and
archaists
mumbling
dry
bones
up
the
land
and
sketchers
lauding
ruined
towns
through
all
that
drowsy
hum
of
voices
smooth
the
hopeful
bird
mounts
carolling
from
brake
the
hopeful
child
with
leaps
to
catch
his
growth
sings
for
liberty
sweet
sake
and
i
a
singer
also
from
my
youth
prefer
to
sing
with
these
who
are
awake
with
birds
with
babes
with
men
who
will
not
fear
the
baptism
of
the
holy
morning
dew
and
many
of
such
wakers
now
are
here
complete
in
their
anointed
manhood
who
will
greatly
dare
and
greatlier
persevere
than
join
those
old
thin
voices
with
my
new
and
sigh
for
italy
with
some
safe
sigh
cooped
up
in
music
an
oh
and
ah
nay
hand
in
hand
with
that
young
child
will
i
go
singing
rather
than
with
those
poets
croon
the
dead
or
cry
tu
men
bella
fossi
italia
less
wretched
if
less
fair
perhaps
a
truth
is
so
far
plain
in
this
that
italy
long
trammelled
with
the
purple
of
her
youth
against
her
age
ripe
activity
sits
still
upon
her
tombs
without
death
ruth
but
also
without
life
brave
energy
now
tell
us
what
is
italy
men
ask
and
others
answer
virgil
cicero
catullus

what
beside
to
task
the
memory
closer
why
boccaccio
dante
petrarca
and
if
still
the
flask
appears
to
yield
its

all
whose
strong
hearts
beat
through

or
charged
again
the
paints
with

of

electrical
or
broke
up

for
music
what
more
then
why
then
no
more
the
chaplet
last
beads
fall
in
naming
the
last
saintship
within
ken
and
after
that
none
prayeth
in
the
land
alas
this
italy
has
too
long
swept
heroic
ashes
up
for
sand
of
her
own
past
impassioned
nympholept
consenting
to
be
nailed
here
by
the
hand
to
the
very
under
which
she
stept
a
queen
of
old
and
plucked
a
leafy
branch
and
licensing
the
world
too
long
indeed
to
use
her
broad
phylacteries
to
staunch
and
stop
her
bloody
lips
she
takes
no
heed
how
one
clear
word
would
draw
an
avalanche
of
living
sons
around
her
to
succeed
the
vanished
generations
can
she
count
these
with
large
live
mobile
mouths
agape
for
macaroni
in
the
amount
of
consecrated
heroes
of
her
bright
rosary
the
pitcher
at
the
fount
the
gift
of
gods
being
broken
she
much
loathes
to
let
the
of
the
place
confer
a
natural
bowl
so
henceforth
she
would
seem
no
nation
but
the
poet
pensioner
with
alms
from
every
land
of
song
and
dream
while
aye
her
pipers
sadly
pipe
of
her
until
their
proper
breaths
in
that
extreme
of
sighing
split
the
reed
on
which
they
played
of
which
no
more
but
never
say
no
more
to
italy
life
her
memories
undismayed
still
argue
evermore
her
graves
implore
her
future
to
be
strong
and
not
afraid
her
very
statues
send
their
looks
before
we
do
not
serve
the
dead
the
past
is
past
god
lives
and
lifts
his
glorious
mornings
up
before
the
eyes
of
men
awake
at
last
who
put
away
the
meats
they
used
to
sup
and
down
upon
the
dust
of
earth
outcast
the
dregs
remaining
of
the
ancient
cup
then
turn
to
wakeful
prayer
and
worthy
act
the
dead
upon
their
awful
ground
the
sun
not
in
their
faces
shall
abstract
no
more
our
strength
we
will
not
be
discrowned
as
guardians
of
their
crowns
nor
deign
transact
a
barter
of
the
present
for
a
sound
of
good
so
counted
in
the
foregone
days
o
dead
ye
shall
no
longer
cling
to
us
with
rigid
hands
of
desiccating
praise
and
drag
us
backward
by
the
garment
thus
to
stand
and
laud
you
in
virelays
we
will
not
henceforth
be
oblivious
of
our
own
lives
because
ye
lived
before
nor
of
our
acts
because
ye
acted
well
we
thank
you
that
ye
first
unlatched
the
door
but
will
not
make
it
inaccessible
by
thankings
on
the
threshold
any
more
we
hurry
onward
to
extinguish
hell
with
our
fresh
souls
our
younger
hope
and
maturity
of
purpose
soon
shall
we
die
also
and
that
then
our
periods
of
life
may
round
themselves
to
memory
as
smoothly
as
on
our
graves
the
we
now
must
look
to
it
to
excel
as
ye
and
bear
our
age
as
far
unlimited
by
the
last
so
to
be
invoked
by
future
generations
as
their
dead
is
true
that
when
the
dust
of
death
has
choked
a
great
man
voice
the
common
words
he
said
turn
oracles
the
common
thoughts
he
yoked
like
horses
draw
like
griffins
this
is
true
and
acceptable
i
too
should
desire
when
men
make
record
with
the
flowers
they
strew
savonarola
soul
went
out
in
fire
upon
our
piazza
and
burned
through
a
moment
first
or
ere
he
did
expire
the
veil
betwixt
the
right
and
wrong
and
showed
how
near
god
sat
and
judged
the
judges
there
upon
the
pavement
overstrewed
to
cast
my
violets
with
as
reverent
care
and
prove
that
all
the
winters
which
have
snowed
can
not
snow
out
the
scent
from
stones
and
air
of
a
sincere
man
virtues
this
was
he
savonarola
who
while
peter
sank
with
his
whole
called
courageously
wake
christ
wake
christ
who
having
tried
the
tank
of
old
used
for
baptistry
ere
luther
came
to
spill
them
swore
they
stank
who
also
by
a
princely
deathbed
cried
loose
florence
or
god
will
not
loose
thy
soul
then
fell
back
the
magnificent
and
died
beneath
the
shooting
from
the
cowl
which
turned
to
the
wide
deep
sea
of
his
ambitions
it
were
foul
to
grudge
savonarola
and
the
rest
their
violets
rather
pay
them
quick
and
fresh
the
emphasis
of
death
makes
manifest
the
eloquence
of
action
in
our
flesh
and
men
who
living
were
but
dimly
guessed
when
once
free
from
their
life
entangled
mesh
show
their
full
length
in
graves
or
oft
indeed
exaggerate
their
stature
in
the
flat
to
noble
admirations
which
exceed
most
nobly
yet
will
calculate
in
that
but
accurately
we
who
are
the
seed
of
buried
creatures
if
we
turned
and
spat
upon
our
antecedents
we
were
vile
bring
violets
rather
if
these
had
not
walked
their
furlong
could
we
hope
to
walk
our
mile
therefore
bring
violets
yet
if
we
stand
still
violets
all
the
while
these
moved
in
vain
of
whom
we
have
vainly
talked
so
rise
up
henceforth
with
a
cheerful
smile
and
having
strewn
the
violets
reap
the
corn
and
having
reaped
and
garnered
bring
the
plough
and
draw
new
furrows
the
healthy
morn
and
plant
the
great
hereafter
in
this
now
of
old
was
so
how
step
by
step
was
worn
as
each
man
gained
on
each
securely
how
each
by
his
own
strength
sought
his
own
ideal
the
ultimate
perfection
leaning
bright
from
out
the
sun
and
stars
to
bless
the
leal
and
earnest
search
of
all
for
fair
and
right
through
doubtful
forms
by
earth
accounted
real
because
old
jubal
blew
into
delight
the
souls
of
men
with
melodies
if
youthful
asaph
were
content
at
most
to
draw
from
jubal
grave
with
listening
eyes
traditionary
music
floating
ghost
into
the
silence
were
it
wise
and
was
not
wiser
jubal
breath
being
lost
that
miriam
clashed
her
cymbals
to
surprise
the
sun
between
her
white
arms
flung
apart
with
new
glad
golden
sounds
that
david
strings
his
hand
with
music
from
his
heart
so
harmony
grows
full
from
many
springs
and
happy
accident
turns
holy
art
you
enter
in
your
florence
wanderings
the
church
of
saint
maria
novella
pass
the
left
stair
where
at
machiavel
saw
one
with
set
fair
face
as
in
a
glass
dressed
out
against
the
fear
of
death
and
hell
rustling
her
silks
in
pauses
of
the
mass
to
keep
the
thought
off
how
her
husband
fell
when
she
left
home
stark
dead
across
her
feet
the
stair
leads
up
to
what
the
orgagnas
save
of
dante
dæmons
you
in
passing
it
ascend
the
right
stair
from
the
farther
nave
to
muse
in
a
small
chapel
scarcely
lit
by
cimabue
virgin
bright
and
brave
that
picture
was
accounted
mark
of
old
a
king
stood
bare
before
its
sovran
grace
a
reverent
people
shouted
to
behold
the
picture
not
the
king
and
even
the
place
containing
such
a
miracle
grew
bold
named
the
glad
borgo
from
that
beauteous
face
which
thrilled
the
artist
after
work
to
think
his
own
ideal
should
stand
so
very
near
him
he
within
the
brink
of
all
that
glory
let
in
by
his
hand
with
too
divine
a
rashness
yet
none
shrink
who
come
to
gaze
here
now
albeit
was
planned
sublimely
in
the
thought
simplicity
the
lady
throned
in
empyreal
state
minds
only
the
young
babe
upon
her
knee
while
sidelong
angels
bear
the
royal
weight
prostrated
meekly
smiling
tenderly
oblivion
of
their
wings
the
child
thereat
stretching
its
hand
like
god
if
any
should
because
of
some
stiff
draperies
and
loose
joints
gaze
scorn
down
from
the
heights
of
raffaelhood
on
cimabue
picture
heaven
anoints
the
head
of
no
such
critic
and
his
blood
the
poet
curse
strikes
full
on
and
appoints
to
ague
and
cold
spasms
for
evermore
a
noble
picture
worthy
of
the
shout
wherewith
along
the
streets
the
people
bore
its
which
the
sun
threw
out
until
they
stooped
and
entered
the
church
door
yet
rightly
was
young
giotto
talked
about
whom
cimabue
found
among
the
sheep
and
knew
as
gods
know
gods
and
carried
home
to
paint
the
things
he
had
painted
with
a
deep
and
fuller
insight
and
so
overcome
his
with
a
heavenlier
sweep
of
light
for
thus
we
mount
into
the
sum
of
great
things
known
or
acted
i
hold
too
that
cimabue
smiled
upon
the
lad
at
the
first
stroke
which
passed
what
he
could
do
or
else
his
virgin
smile
had
never
had
such
sweetness
in
all
great
men
who
foreknew
their
heirs
in
art
for
art
sake
have
been
glad
and
bent
their
old
white
heads
as
if
uncrowned
fanatics
of
their
pure
ideals
still
far
more
than
of
their
triumphs
which
were
found
with
some
less
vehement
struggle
of
the
will
if
old
margheritone
trembled
swooned
and
died
despairing
at
the
open
sill
of
other
men
achievements
who
achieved
by
loving
art
beyond
the
master
he
was
old
margheritone
and
conceived
never
at
first
youth
and
most
ecstasy
a
virgin
like
that
dream
of
one
which
heaved
the
from
his
heart
if
wistfully
margheritone
sickened
at
the
smell
of
cimabue
laurel
let
him
go
for
cimabue
stood
up
very
well
in
spite
of
giotto
and
angelico
the
kept
smiling
in
his
cell
the
smile
with
which
he
welcomed
the
sweet
slow
inbreak
of
angels
whitening
through
the
dim
that
he
might
paint
them
while
the
sudden
sense
of
raffael
future
was
revealed
to
him
by
force
of
his
own
fair
works
competence
the
same
blue
waters
where
the
dolphins
swim
suggest
the
tritons
through
the
blue
immense
strike
out
all
swimmers
cling
not
in
the
way
of
one
another
so
to
sink
but
learn
the
strong
man
impulse
catch
the
freshening
spray
he
throws
up
in
his
motions
and
discern
by
his
clear
westering
eye
the
time
of
day
thou
god
hast
set
us
worthy
gifts
to
earn
besides
thy
heaven
and
thee
and
when
i
say
there
room
here
for
the
weakest
man
alive
to
live
and
die
there
room
too
i
repeat
for
all
the
strongest
to
live
well
and
strive
their
own
way
by
their
individual
heat
like
some
new
leaving
the
old
hive
despite
the
wax
which
tempts
so
then
let
the
living
live
the
dead
retain
their
flowers
though
honour
best
supplied
by
bringing
actions
to
prove
theirs
not
vain
cold
graves
we
say
it
shall
be
testified
that
living
men
who
burn
in
heart
and
brain
without
the
dead
were
colder
if
we
tried
to
sink
the
past
beneath
our
feet
be
sure
the
future
would
not
stand
precipitate
this
old
roof
from
the
shrine
and
insecure
the
nesting
swallows
fly
off
mate
from
mate
how
scant
the
gardens
if
the
graves
were
fewer
the
tall
green
poplars
grew
no
longer
straight
whose
tops
not
looked
to
troy
would
any
fight
for
athens
and
not
swear
by
marathon
who
dared
build
temples
without
tombs
in
sight
or
live
without
some
dead
man
benison
or
seek
truth
hope
for
good
and
strive
for
right
if
looking
up
he
saw
not
in
the
sun
some
angel
of
the
martyrs
all
day
long
standing
and
waiting
your
last
rhythm
will
need
your
earliest
could
i
sing
this
song
if
my
dead
masters
had
not
taken
heed
to
help
the
heavens
and
earth
to
make
me
strong
as
the
wind
ever
will
find
out
some
reed
and
touch
it
to
such
issues
as
belong
to
such
a
frail
thing
none
may
grudge
the
dead
libations
from
full
cups
unless
we
choose
to
look
back
to
the
hills
behind
us
spread
the
plains
before
us
sadden
and
confuse
if
orphaned
we
are
disinherited
i
would
but
turn
these
lachrymals
to
use
and
pour
fresh
oil
in
from
the
to
furnish
them
as
new
lamps
shall
i
say
what
made
my
heart
beat
with
exulting
love
a
few
weeks
back
the
day
was
such
a
day
as
florence
owes
the
sun
the
sky
above
its
weight
upon
the
mountains
seemed
to
lay
and
palpitate
in
glory
like
a
dove
who
has
flown
too
fast
take
away
the
image
for
the
heart
of
man
beat
higher
that
day
in
florence
flooding
all
her
streets
and
piazzas
with
a
tumult
and
desire
the
people
with
accumulated
heats
and
faces
turned
one
way
as
if
one
fire
both
drew
and
flushed
them
left
their
ancient
beats
and
went
up
toward
the
wall
to
thank
their
who
not
quite
of
course
had
graciously
permitted
at
their
call
the
citizens
to
use
their
civic
force
to
guard
their
civic
homes
so
one
and
all
the
tuscan
cities
streamed
up
to
the
source
of
this
new
good
at
florence
taking
it
as
good
so
far
presageful
of
more
good
the
first
torch
of
italian
freedom
lit
to
toss
in
the
next
tiger
face
who
should
approach
too
near
them
in
a
greedy
fit
the
first
pulse
of
an
even
flow
of
blood
to
prove
the
level
of
italian
veins
towards
rights
perceived
and
granted
how
we
gazed
from
casa
guidi
windows
while
in
trains
of
orderly
procession
banners
raised
and
intermittent
bursts
of
martial
strains
which
died
upon
the
shout
as
if
amazed
by
gladness
beyond
music
they
passed
on
the
magistracy
with
insignia
passed
and
all
the
people
shouted
in
the
sun
and
all
the
thousand
windows
which
had
cast
a
ripple
of
silks
in
blue
and
scarlet
down
as
if
the
houses
overflowed
at
last
seemed
growing
larger
with
fair
heads
and
eyes
the
lawyers
passed
and
still
arose
the
shout
and
hands
broke
from
the
windows
to
surprise
those
grave
calm
brows
with
leaves
thrown
out
the
priesthood
passed
the
friars
with
keen
sidelong
glances
from
their
beards
about
the
street
to
see
who
shouted
many
a
monk
who
takes
a
long
rope
in
the
waist
was
there
whereat
the
popular
exultation
drunk
with
indrawn
vivas
the
whole
sunny
air
while
through
the
murmuring
windows
rose
and
sunk
a
cloud
of
kerchiefed
hands
the
church
makes
fair
her
welcome
in
the
new
pope
name
ensued
the
black
sign
of
the
martyrs
name
no
name
but
count
the
graves
in
silence
next
were
viewed
the
artists
next
the
trades
and
after
came
the
people
flag
and
sign
and
rights
as
good
and
very
loud
the
shout
was
for
that
same
motto
il
popolo
il
popolo
the
word
means
dukedom
empire
majesty
and
kings
in
such
an
hour
might
read
it
so
and
next
with
banners
each
in
his
degree
deputed
representatives
of
every
separate
state
of
tuscany
siena
bristling
on
the
fold
of
the
first
flag
preceded
pisa
hare
and
massa
lion
floated
calm
in
gold
pienza
following
with
his
silver
stare
arezzo
steed
pranced
clear
from
and
well
might
shout
our
florence
greeting
there
these
and
more
brethren
last
the
world
had
sent
the
various
children
of
her
teeming
flanks
greeks
english
french
as
if
to
a
parliament
of
lovers
of
her
italy
in
ranks
each
bearing
its
land
symbol
reverent
at
which
the
stones
seemed
breaking
into
thanks
and
rattling
up
the
sky
such
sounds
in
proof
arose
the
very
seemed
to
bend
the
very
windows
up
from
door
to
roof
flashed
out
a
rapture
of
bright
heads
to
mend
with
passionate
looks
the
gesture
whirling
off
a
hurricane
of
leaves
three
hours
did
end
while
all
these
passed
and
ever
in
the
crowd
rude
men
unconscious
of
the
tears
that
kept
their
beards
moist
shouted
some
few
laughed
aloud
and
none
asked
any
why
they
laughed
and
wept
friends
kissed
each
other
cheeks
and
foes
long
vowed
more
warmly
did
it
babies
leapt
right
upward
in
their
mother
arms
whose
black
wide
glittering
eyes
looked
elsewhere
lovers
pressed
each
before
either
neither
glancing
back
and
peasant
maidens
smoothly
and
tressed
forgot
to
finger
on
their
throats
the
slack
great
while
old
blind
men
would
not
rest
but
pattered
with
their
staves
and
slid
their
shoes
along
the
stones
and
smiled
as
if
they
saw
o
heaven
i
think
that
day
had
noble
use
among
god
days
so
near
stood
right
and
law
both
mutually
forborne
law
would
not
bruise
nor
right
deny
and
each
in
reverent
awe
honoured
the
other
and
if
that
good
day
sun
delivered
to
the
vines
no
charta
and
the
liberal
duke
excess
did
scarce
exceed
a
guelf
or
in
any
special
actual
righteousness
of
what
that
day
he
granted
still
the
signs
are
good
and
full
of
promise
we
must
say
when
multitudes
approach
their
kings
with
prayers
and
kings
concede
their
people
right
to
pray
both
in
one
sunshine
griefs
are
not
despairs
so
uttered
nor
can
royal
claims
dismay
when
men
from
humble
homes
and
ducal
chairs
hate
wrong
together
it
was
well
to
view
those
banners
ruffled
in
a
ruler
face
inscribed
live
freedom
union
and
all
true
brave
patriots
who
are
aided
by
god
grace
nor
was
it
ill
when
leopoldo
drew
his
little
children
to
the
he
stood
in
at
the
pitti
to
suggest
too
should
govern
as
the
people
willed
what
a
cry
rose
then
some
who
saw
the
best
declared
his
eyes
filled
up
and
overfilled
with
good
warm
human
tears
which
unrepressed
ran
down
i
like
his
face
the
forehead
build
has
no
capacious
genius
yet
perhaps
sufficient
comprehension
mild
and
sad
and
careful
nobly
not
with
care
that
wraps
hearts
to
stifle
and
make
mad
but
careful
with
the
care
that
shuns
a
lapse
of
faith
and
duty
studious
not
to
add
a
burden
in
the
gathering
of
a
gain
and
so
god
save
the
duke
i
say
with
those
who
that
day
shouted
it
and
while
dukes
reign
may
all
wear
in
the
visible
overflows
of
spirit
such
a
look
of
careful
pain
for
god
must
love
it
better
than
repose
and
all
the
people
who
went
up
to
let
their
hearts
out
to
that
duke
as
has
been
told
where
guess
ye
that
the
living
people
met
kept
tryst
formed
ranks
chose
leaders
first
unrolled
their
banners
in
the
loggia
where
is
set
cellini
godlike
perseus
bronze
or
gold
how
name
the
metal
when
the
statue
flings
its
soul
so
in
your
eyes
with
brow
and
sword
superbly
calm
as
all
opposing
things
slain
with
the
gorgon
were
no
more
abhorred
since
ended
no
the
people
sought
no
wings
from
perseus
in
the
loggia
nor
implored
an
inspiration
in
the
place
beside
from
that
dim
bust
of
brutus
jagged
and
grand
where
buonarroti
passionately
tried
from
out
the
marble
to
demand
the
head
of
rome
sublimest
homicide
then
dropt
the
quivering
mallet
from
his
hand
despairing
he
could
find
no
of
brutus
in
all
florence
where
he
found
the
gods
and
gladiators
thick
enough
nor
there
the
people
chose
still
holier
ground
the
people
who
are
simple
blind
and
rough
know
their
own
angels
after
looking
round
whom
chose
they
then
where
met
they
on
the
stone
called
dante
a
plain
flat
stone
scarce
discerned
from
others
in
the
pavement
whereupon
he
used
to
bring
his
quiet
chair
out
turned
to
brunelleschi
church
and
pour
alone
the
lava
of
his
spirit
when
it
burned
it
is
not
cold
o
passionate
poor
dante
who
a
banished
florentine
didst
sit
austere
at
banquets
of
the
great
and
muse
upon
this
stone
of
thine
and
think
how
oft
some
passer
used
to
wait
a
moment
in
the
golden
day
decline
with
good
night
dearest
dante
well
good
night
muse
now
dante
and
think
verily
though
chapelled
in
the
byeway
out
of
sight
ravenna
bones
would
thrill
with
ecstasy
couldst
know
thy
favourite
stone
elected
right
as
for
thy
tuscans
to
foresee
their
earliest
chartas
from
good
night
good
morn
henceforward
dante
now
my
soul
is
sure
that
thine
is
better
comforted
of
scorn
and
looks
down
earthward
in
completer
cure
than
when
in
santa
croce
church
forlorn
of
any
corpse
the
architect
and
hewer
did
pile
the
empty
marbles
as
thy
tomb
for
now
thou
art
no
longer
exiled
now
best
honoured
we
salute
thee
who
art
come
back
to
the
old
stone
with
a
softer
brow
than
giotto
drew
upon
the
wall
for
some
good
lovers
of
our
age
to
track
and
plough
their
way
to
through
time
ordures
stratified
and
startle
broad
awake
into
the
dull
bargello
chamber
now
now
beatrix
may
leap
up
glad
to
cull
thy
first
smile
even
in
heaven
and
at
her
side
like
that
which
nine
years
old
looked
beautiful
at
what
do
i
say
i
only
meant
that
tender
dante
loved
his
florence
well
while
florence
now
to
love
him
is
content
and
mark
ye
that
the
piercingest
sweet
smell
of
love
dear
incense
by
the
living
sent
to
find
the
dead
is
not
accessible
to
lazy
livers
no
narcotic
not
swung
in
a
censer
to
a
sleepy
tune
but
trod
out
in
the
morning
air
by
hot
quick
spirits
who
tread
firm
to
ends
foreshown
and
use
the
name
of
greatness
unforgot
to
meditate
what
greatness
may
be
done
for
dante
sits
in
heaven
and
ye
stand
here
and
more
remains
for
doing
all
must
feel
than
trysting
on
his
stone
from
year
to
year
to
shift
processions
civic
toe
to
heel
the
town
thanks
to
the
pitti
are
ye
freer
for
what
was
felt
that
day
a
may
spin
fast
yet
the
chariot
never
roll
but
if
that
day
suggested
something
good
and
bettered
with
one
purpose
soul
by
soul
better
means
freer
a
land
brotherhood
is
most
puissant
men
upon
the
whole
are
what
they
can
be
nations
what
they
would
will
therefore
to
be
strong
thou
italy
will
to
be
noble
austrian
metternich
can
fix
no
yoke
unless
the
neck
agree
and
thine
is
like
the
lion
when
the
thick
dews
shudder
from
it
and
no
man
would
be
the
stroker
of
his
mane
much
less
would
prick
his
nostril
with
a
reed
when
nations
roar
like
lions
who
shall
tame
them
and
defraud
of
the
due
pasture
by
the
roar
therefore
shake
your
dewlaps
dry
abroad
the
amphitheatre
with
open
door
leads
back
upon
the
benches
who
applaud
the
last
yet
the
heavens
forbid
that
we
should
call
on
passion
to
confront
the
brutal
with
the
brutal
and
amid
this
ripening
world
suggest
a
and
for
the
wrongs
men
did
and
do
now
though
the
spears
are
getting
blunt
we
only
call
because
the
sight
and
proof
of
hurts
nothing
and
to
show
a
and
measure
paw
with
hoof
helps
something
even
and
will
instruct
a
foe
as
well
as
the
onslaught
how
to
stand
aloof
or
else
the
world
gets
past
the
mere
brute
blow
or
given
or
taken
children
use
the
fist
until
they
are
of
age
to
use
the
brain
and
so
we
needed
cæsars
to
assist
man
justice
and
napoleons
to
explain
god
counsel
when
a
point
was
nearly
missed
until
our
generations
should
attain
christ
stature
nearer
not
that
we
alas
attain
already
but
a
single
inch
will
raise
to
look
down
on
the
swordsman
pass
as
knightly
roland
on
the
coward
flinch
and
after
chloroform
and
we
find
out
slowly

than
even
of

when
he
of

began
to

which
slew

seeing

will
leave
the
heat
of
their
escaping
godship
to
endue
the
human
medium
with
a
heavenly
flush
meanwhile
in
this
same
italy
we
want
not
popular
passion
to
arise
and
crush
but
popular
conscience
which
may
covenant
for
what
it
knows
concede
without

very
noble
they
are
nought
for
every

ye
dress
your
sallow
kine
with
fringes
down
their
cheeks
though
unbesought
they
loll
their
heavy
heads
and
drag
the
wine
and
bear
the
wooden
yoke
as
they
were
taught
the
first

what
ye
want
is
light
indeed
not
sunlight
ye
may
well
look
up
surprised
to
those
unfathomable
heavens
that
feed
your
purple

god
light

we
lift
a

it
falls
the

we
want
thee
o
unfound
and
sovran
teacher
if
thy
beard
be
grey
or
black
we
bid
thee
rise
up
from
the
ground
and
speak
the
word
god
giveth
thee
to
say
inspiring
into
all
this
people
round
instead
of
passion
thought
which
pioneers
all
generous
passion
purifies
from
sin
and
strikes
the
hour
for
rise

teacher
a
crowd
to
make
a
nation
best
begin
by
making
each
a

till
all
be

true

unbar
the

keep
locked

overclose
they
only

across

while
every

dangles
as
he
goes
the
great
key
at
his
girdle
and
abhors
in
christ
name
meekly
open
wide
the
house
concede
the
entrance

tend
the

of

branches
and
expand
the
inner
souls
of
men
before
you

but
the
teacher
where
from
all
these
crowded
faces
all
alive
eyes
of
their
own
lids
flashing
themselves
bare
and
brows
that
with
a
mobile
life
contrive
a
deeper
shadow
may
we
in
no
wise
dare
to
put
a
finger
out
and
touch
a
man
and
cry
this
is
the
leader
what
all
these
broad
heads
black
eyes
yet
not
a
soul
that
ran
from
god
down
with
a
message
all
to
please
the
donna
waving
measures
with
her
fan
and
not
the
on
his
knees
the
trumpet
just
an
inch
off
from
his
lips
who
when
he
breathes
next
will
put
out
the
sun
yet
mankind
self
were
foundered
in
eclipse
if
lacking
doers
with
great
works
to
be
done
and
lo
the
startled
earth
already
dips
back
into
light
a
better
day
begun
and
soon
this
leader
teacher
will
stand
plain
and
build
the
golden
pipes
and
synthesize
this
for
a
holy
strain
we
hold
this
hope
and
still
in
all
these
eyes
go
sounding
for
the
deep
look
which
shall
drain
suffused
thought
into
channelled
enterprise
where
is
the
teacher
what
now
may
he
do
who
shall
do
greatly
doth
he
gird
his
waist
with
a
monk
rope
like
luther
or
pursue
the
goat
like
tell
or
dry
his
nets
in
haste
like
masaniello
when
the
sky
was
blue
keep
house
like
other
peasants
with
inlaced
bare
brawny
arms
about
a
favourite
child
and
meditative
looks
beyond
the
door
but
not
to
mark
the
kidling
teeth
have
filed
the
green
shoots
of
his
vine
which
last
year
bore
full
twenty
bunches
or
on
sit
at
ease
to
bless
the
poor
like
other
pontiffs
in
the
poorest
name
the
old
tiara
keeps
itself
aslope
upon
his
steady
brows
which
all
the
same
bend
mildly
to
permit
the
people
hope
whatever
hand
shall
grasp
this
oriflamme
whatever
man
last
peasant
or
first
pope
seeking
to
free
his
country
shall
appear
teach
lead
strike
fire
into
the
masses
fill
these
empty
bladders
with
fine
air
insphere
these
wills
into
a
unity
of
will
and
make
of
italy
a
nation
dear
and
blessed
be
that
man
the
heavens
shall
kill
no
leaf
the
earth
lets
grow
for
him
and
death
shall
cast
him
back
upon
the
lap
of
life
to
live
more
surely
in
a
of
brutus
with
the
knife
rienzi
with
the
fasces
throb
beneath
rome
stones
and
more
who
threw
away
joy
fife
like
pallas
that
the
beauty
of
their
souls
might
ever
shine
untroubled
and
entire
but
if
it
can
be
true
that
he
who
rolls
the
church
thunders
will
reserve
her
fire
for
only
light
from
eucharistic
bowls
will
pour
new
life
for
nations
that
expire
and
rend
the
scarlet
of
his
papal
vest
to
gird
the
weak
loins
of
his
countrymen
i
hold
that
he
surpasses
all
the
rest
of
romans
heroes
patriots
and
that
when
he
sat
down
on
the
throne
he
dispossessed
the
first
graves
of
some
glory
see
again
this
is
a
glorious
thing
and
if
a
common
man
achieved
it
well
say
a
rich
man
did
excellent
a
king
that
grows
sublime
a
priest
improbable
a
pope
ah
there
we
stop
and
can
not
bring
our
faith
up
to
the
leap
with
history
bell
so
heavy
round
the
neck
of
it
albeit
we
fain
would
grant
the
possibility
for
sake
pio
nono
stretch
thy
feet
in
that
case
i
will
kiss
them
reverently
as
any
pilgrim
to
the
papal
seat
and
such
proved
possible
thy
throne
to
me
shall
seem
as
holy
a
place
as
venetian
dungeon
or
as
spielberg
grate
at
which
the
lombard
woman
hung
the
rose
of
her
sweet
soul
by
its
own
dewy
weight
to
feel
the
dungeon
round
her
sunshine
close
and
pining
so
died
early
yet
too
late
for
what
she
suffered
yea
i
will
not
choose
betwixt
thy
throne
pope
pius
and
the
spot
marked
red
for
ever
spite
of
rains
and
dews
where
two
fell
riddled
by
the
austrian
shot
the
brothers
bandiera
who
accuse
with
one
same
and
face
that
what
they
speak
may
be
invincible
the
sins
of
earth
tormentors
before
god
the
just
until
the
unconscious
thunderbolt
begins
to
loosen
in
his
grasp
and
yet
we
must
beware
and
mark
the
natural
kiths
and
kins
of
circumstance
and
office
and
distrust
the
rich
man
reasoning
in
a
poor
man
hut
the
poet
who
neglects
pure
truth
to
prove
statistic
fact
the
child
who
leaves
a
rut
for
a
smoother
road
the
priest
who
vows
his
glove
exhales
no
grace
the
prince
who
walks
afoot
the
woman
who
has
sworn
she
will
not
love
and
this
ninth
pius
in
seventh
gregory
chair
with
andrea
doria
forehead
count
what
goes
to
making
up
a
pope
before
he
wear
that
triple
crown
we
pass
the
throes
which
went
to
make
the
popedom
the
despair
of
free
men
good
men
wise
men
the
dread
shows
of
women
faces
by
the
faggot
flash
tossed
out
to
the
minutest
stir
and
throb
o
the
white
lips
the
least
tremble
of
a
lash
to
glut
the
red
stare
of
a
licensed
mob
the
short
mad
cries
down
oubliettes
and
plash
so
horribly
far
off
priests
trained
to
rob
and
kings
that
like
encouraged
nightmares
sat
on
nations
hearts
most
heavily
distressed
with
monstrous
sights
and
apophthegms
of
fate
we
pass
these
things
because
the
times
are
prest
with
necessary
charges
of
the
weight
of
all
this
sin
and
calvin
for
the
rest
made
bold
to
burn
servetus
ah
men
err
and
so
do
which
is
all
we
mean
to
bring
to
proof
in
any
register
of
theological
fat
kine
and
lean
so
drive
them
back
into
the
pens
refer
old
sins
with
pourpoint
quotha
and
i
ween
entirely
to
the
old
times
the
old
times
nor
ever
ask
why
this
preponderant
infallible
pure
church
could
set
her
chimes
most
loudly
then
just
then
most
jubilant
precisely
then
when
mankind
stood
in
crimes
full
and
heaven
judgments
were
not
scant
inquire
still
less
what
signifies
a
church
of
perfect
inspiration
and
pure
laws
who
burns
the
first
man
with
a
and
grinds
the
second
bone
by
bone
because
the
times
forsooth
are
used
to
rack
and
scorch
what
a
holy
church
unless
she
awes
the
times
down
from
their
sins
did
christ
select
such
amiable
times
to
come
and
teach
love
to
and
mercy
the
whole
world
were
wrecked
if
every
mere
great
man
who
lives
to
reach
a
little
leaf
of
popular
respect
attained
not
simply
by
some
special
breach
in
the
age
customs
by
some
precedence
in
thought
and
act
which
having
proved
him
higher
than
those
he
lived
with
proved
his
competence
in
helping
them
to
wonder
and
aspire
my
words
are
guiltless
of
the
bigot
sense
my
soul
has
fire
to
mingle
with
the
fire
of
all
these
souls
within
or
out
of
doors
of
rome
church
or
another
i
believe
in
one
priest
and
one
temple
with
its
floors
of
shining
jasper
gloom
at
morn
and
eve
by
countless
knees
of
earnest
auditors
and
crystal
walls
too
lucid
to
perceive
that
none
may
take
the
measure
of
the
place
and
say
so
far
the
porphyry
then
the
flint
to
this
mark
mercy
goes
and
there
ends
grace
though
still
the
permeable
crystals
hint
at
some
white
starry
distance
bathed
in
space
i
feel
how
nature
keep
the
dint
of
undersprings
of
silent
deity
i
hold
the
articulated
gospels
which
show
christ
among
us
crucified
on
tree
i
love
all
who
love
truth
if
poor
or
rich
in
what
they
have
won
of
truth
possessively
no
altars
and
no
hands
defiled
with
pitch
shall
scare
me
off
but
i
will
pray
and
eat
with
all
these
taking
leave
to
choose
my
ewers
and
say
at
last
your
visible
churches
cheat
their
inward
types
and
if
a
church
assures
of
standing
without
failure
and
defeat
the
same
both
fails
and
lies
to
leave
which
lures
of
wider
subject
through
past
years
behold
we
come
back
from
the
popedom
to
the
pope
to
ponder
what
he
be
ere
we
are
bold
for
what
he
be
with
our
heavy
hope
to
trust
upon
his
soul
so
fold
by
fold
explore
this
mummy
in
the
priestly
cope
transmitted
through
the
darks
of
time
to
catch
the
man
within
the
wrappage
and
discern
how
he
an
honest
man
upon
the
watch
full
fifty
years
for
what
a
man
may
learn
contrived
to
get
just
there
with
what
a
snatch
of
oboli
he
had
to
earn
the
passage
through
with
what
a
drowsy
sop
to
drench
the
busy
barkings
of
his
brain
what
ghosts
of
pale
tradition
wreathed
with
hop
wakeful
thought
he
had
to
entertain
for
heavenly
visions
and
consent
to
stop
the
clock
at
noon
and
let
the
hour
remain
without
vain
inviolate
against
all
chimings
from
the
belfry
lo
from
every
given
pope
you
must
abate
albeit
you
love
him
some
things
good
you
know
which
every
given
heretic
you
hate
assumes
for
his
as
being
plainly
so
a
pope
must
hold
by
popes
a
little
yes
by
councils
from
nicæa
up
to
trent
by
hierocratic
empire
more
or
less
irresponsible
to
men
he
must
resent
each
man
particular
conscience
and
repress
inquiry
meditation
argument
as
tyrants
faction
also
he
must
not
love
truth
too
dangerously
but
prefer
the
interests
of
the
church
because
a
blot
is
better
than
a
rent
in
miniver
submit
to
see
the
people
swallow
hot
which
his
chartered
churchmen
stir
quoting
the
only
true
god
epigraph
feed
my
lambs
peter
must
consent
to
sit
attesting
with
his
pastoral
ring
and
staff
to
such
a
picture
of
our
lady
hit
off
well
by
though
not
half
as
fair
as
giotto
would
have
painted
it
to
such
a
vial
where
a
dead
man
blood
runs
yearly
warm
beneath
a
churchman
finger
to
such
a
holy
house
of
stone
and
wood
whereof
a
cloud
of
angels
was
the
bringer
from
bethlehem
to
loreto
were
it
good
for
any
pope
on
earth
to
be
a
flinger
of
stones
against
these
counterfeits
apostates
only
are
iconoclasts
he
dares
not
say
while
this
false
thing
abets
that
true
thing
this
is
false
he
keeps
his
fasts
and
prayers
as
prayer
and
fast
were
silver
frets
to
change
a
note
upon
a
string
that
lasts
and
make
a
lie
a
virtue
now
if
he
did
more
than
this
higher
hoped
and
braver
dared
i
think
he
were
a
pope
in
jeopardy
or
no
pope
rather
for
his
truth
had
barred
the
vaulting
of
his
life
and
certainly
if
he
do
only
this
mankind
regard
moves
on
from
him
at
once
to
seek
some
new
teacher
and
leader
he
is
good
and
great
according
to
the
deeds
a
pope
can
do
most
liberal
save
those
bonds
affectionate
as
princes
may
be
and
as
priests
are
true
but
only
the
ninth
pius
after
eight
when
all
praised
most
at
best
and
hopefullest
he
pope
we
want
a
man
his
heart
beats
warm
but
like
the
prince
enchanted
to
the
waist
he
sits
in
stone
and
hardens
by
a
charm
into
the
marble
of
his
throne
mild
benediction
waves
his
saintly
arm
so
good
but
what
we
want
a
perfect
man
complete
and
all
alive
half
travertine
half
suits
our
need
and
ill
subserves
our
plan
feet
knees
nerves
sinews
energies
divine
were
never
yet
too
much
for
men
who
ran
in
such
hard
ways
as
must
be
this
of
thine
deliverer
whom
we
seek
thou
art
pope
prince
or
peasant
if
indeed
the
first
the
noblest
therefore
since
the
heroic
heart
within
thee
must
be
great
enough
to
burst
those
trammels
buckling
to
the
baser
part
thy
saintly
peers
in
rome
who
crossed
and
cursed
with
the
same
finger
come
appear
be
found
if
pope
or
peasant
come
we
hear
the
cock
the
courtier
of
the
mountains
when
first
crowned
with
golden
dawn
and
orient
glories
flock
to
meet
the
sun
upon
the
highest
ground
take
voice
and
work
we
wait
to
hear
thee
knock
at
some
one
of
our
florentine
nine
gates
on
each
of
which
was
imaged
a
sublime
face
of
a
tuscan
genius
which
for
and
love
sake
both
our
florence
in
her
prime
turned
boldly
on
all
comers
to
her
states
as
heroes
turned
their
shields
in
antique
time
emblazoned
with
honourable
acts
and
though
the
gates
are
blank
now
of
such
images
and
petrarch
looks
no
more
from
nicolo
toward
dear
arezzo
the
nor
dante
from
gate
gallo
still
we
know
despite
the
razing
of
the
blazonries
remains
the
consecration
of
the
shield
the
dead
heroic
faces
will
start
out
on
all
these
gates
if
foes
should
take
the
field
and
blend
sublimely
at
the
earliest
shout
with
living
heroes
who
will
scorn
to
yield
a
even
when
gazing
round
about
they
find
in
what
a
glorious
company
they
fight
the
foes
of
florence
who
will
grudge
his
one
poor
life
when
that
great
man
we
see
has
given
five
hundred
years
the
world
being
judge
to
help
the
glory
of
his
italy
who
born
the
fair
side
of
the
alps
will
budge
when
dante
stays
when
ariosto
stays
when
petrarch
stays
for
ever
ye
bring
swords
my
tuscans
ay
if
wanted
in
this
haze
bring
swords
but
first
bring
souls
bring
thoughts
and
words
unrusted
by
a
tear
of
yesterday
yet
awful
by
its
wrong
and
cut
these
cords
and
mow
this
green
lush
falseness
to
the
roots
and
shut
the
mouth
of
hell
below
the
swathe
and
if
ye
can
bring
songs
too
let
the
recoverable
music
softly
bathe
some
poet
hand
that
through
all
bursts
and
bruits
of
popular
passion
all
unripe
and
rathe
convictions
of
the
popular
intellect
ye
may
not
lack
a
finger
up
the
air
annunciative
reproving
pure
erect
to
show
which
way
your
first
ideal
bare
the
whiteness
of
its
wings
when
sorely
pecked
by
falcons
on
your
wrists
it
unaware
arose
up
overhead
and
out
of
sight
meanwhile
let
all
the
far
ends
of
the
world
breathe
back
the
deep
breath
of
their
old
delight
to
swell
the
italian
banner
just
unfurled
help
lands
of
europe
for
if
austria
fight
the
drums
will
bar
your
slumber
had
ye
curled
the
laurel
for
your
thousand
artists
brows
if
these
italian
hands
had
planted
none
can
any
sit
down
idle
in
the
house
nor
hear
appeals
from
buonarroti
stone
and
raffael
canvas
rousing
and
to
rouse
where
poussin
master
gallic
avignon
bred
laura
and
vaucluse
fount
has
stirred
the
heart
of
france
too
strongly
as
it
lets
its
little
stream
out
like
a
wizard
bird
which
bounds
upon
its
emerald
wing
and
wets
the
rocks
on
each
side
that
she
should
not
gird
her
loins
with
charlemagne
sword
when
foes
beset
the
country
of
her
petrarch
spain
may
well
be
minded
how
from
italy
she
caught
to
mingle
with
her
tinkling
moorish
bell
a
fuller
cadence
and
a
subtler
thought
and
even
the
new
world
the
receptacle
of
freemen
may
send
glad
men
as
it
ought
to
greet
vespucci
amerigo
door
while
england
claims
by
trump
of
poetry
verona
venice
the
and
dearer
holds
john
milton
fiesole
than
langland
malvern
with
the
stars
in
flower
and
vallombrosa
we
two
went
to
see
last
june
beloved
companion
where
sublime
the
mountains
live
in
holy
families
and
the
slow
pinewoods
ever
climb
and
climb
half
up
their
breasts
just
stagger
as
they
seize
some
grey
crag
drop
back
with
it
many
a
time
and
straggle
blindly
down
the
precipice
the
vallombrosan
brooks
were
strewn
as
thick
that
with
dead
beechen
leaves
as
milton
saw
them
ere
his
heart
grew
sick
and
his
eyes
blind
i
think
the
monks
and
beeves
are
all
the
same
too
scarce
have
they
changed
the
wick
on
good
saint
gualbert
altar
which
receives
the
convent
pilgrims
and
the
pool
in
front
wherein
the
trout
are
cast
to
wait
the
beatific
vision
and
the
grunt
used
at
refectory
keeps
its
weedy
state
to
baffle
saintly
abbots
who
would
count
the
fish
across
their
breviary
nor
the
measure
of
their
steps
o
waterfalls
and
forests
sound
and
silence
mountains
bare
that
leap
up
peak
by
peak
and
catch
the
palls
of
purple
and
silver
mist
to
rend
and
share
with
one
another
at
electric
calls
of
life
in
the
sunbeams
till
we
can
not
dare
fix
your
shapes
count
your
number
we
must
think
your
beauty
and
your
glory
helped
to
fill
the
cup
of
milton
soul
so
to
the
brink
he
never
more
was
thirsty
when
god
will
had
shattered
to
his
sense
the
last
by
which
he
had
drawn
from
nature
visible
the
fresh
satisfied
by
this
he
sang
of
adam
paradise
and
smiled
remembering
vallombrosa
therefore
is
the
place
divine
to
english
man
and
child
and
pilgrims
leave
their
souls
here
in
a
kiss
for
italy
the
whole
earth
treasury
piled
with
reveries
of
gentle
ladies
flung
aside
like
ravelled
silk
from
life
worn
stuff
with
coins
of
scholars
fancy
which
being
rung
on

still
sound
in
short
with
all
the
dreams
of
dreamers
young
before
their
heads
have
time
for
slipping
off
hope
pillow
to
the
ground
how
oft
indeed
we
sent
our
souls
out
from
the
rigid
north
on
bare
white
feet
which
would
not
print
nor
bleed
to
climb
the
alpine
passes
and
look
forth
where
booming
low
the
lombard
rivers
lead
to
gardens
vineyards
all
a
dream
is
worth
sights
thou
and
i
love
have
seen
afterward
from
tuscan
bellosguardo
wide
awake
when
standing
on
the
actual
blessed
sward
where
galileo
stood
at
nights
to
take
the
vision
of
the
stars
we
have
found
it
hard
gazing
upon
the
earth
and
heaven
to
make
a
choice
of
beauty
therefore
let
us
all
refreshed
in
england
or
in
other
land
by
visions
with
their
and
fall
of
this
earth
darling
we
who
understand
a
little
how
the
tuscan
musical
vowels
do
round
themselves
as
if
they
planned
eternities
of
separate
sweetness
we
who
loved
sorrento
vines
in
or
ere
in
we
pledged
faith
or
glee
who
loved
rome
wolf
with
at
suck
or
ere
we
loved
truth
own
divinity
who
loved
in
brief
the
classic
hill
and
brook
and
ovid
dreaming
tales
and
petrarch
song
or
ere
we
loved
love
self
even
let
us
give
the
blessing
of
our
souls
and
wish
them
strong
to
bear
it
to
the
height
where
prayers
arrive
when
faithful
spirits
pray
against
a
wrong
to
this
great
cause
of
southern
men
who
strive
in
god
name
for
man
rights
and
shall
not
fail
behold
they
shall
not
fail
the
shouts
ascend
above
the
shrieks
in
naples
and
prevail
rows
of
shot
corpses
waiting
for
the
end
of
burial
seem
to
smile
up
straight
and
pale
into
the
azure
air
and
apprehend
that
final
from
palermo
coast
which
lightens
their
apocalypse
of
death
so
let
them
die
the
world
shows
nothing
lost
therefore
not
blood
above
or
underneath
what
matter
brothers
if
ye
keep
your
post
on
duty
side
as
sword
returns
to
sheath
so
dust
to
grave
but
souls
find
place
in
heaven
heroic
daring
is
the
true
success
the
eucharistic
bread
requires
no
leaven
and
though
your
ends
were
hopeless
we
should
bless
your
cause
as
holy
strive
and
having

take
for

recompense
that

beneath

dropped
before

for

o

the
type
too
plain
didst
thou
too
only
sing
of
liberty
as
little

take
up
a
high
strain
with
unintentioned
voices
and
break
off
to
sleep
upon
their

thou
not
watch
one

then
sleep
enough
that
sleep
may
hasten

sustain
the
faint

went

so
between

took
the
patriot
oath
which
henceforth
stands
among
the
oaths
of
perjurers
eminent
to
catch
the
lightnings
ripened
for
these
lands
why
swear
at
all
thou
false
duke
leopold
what
need
to
swear
what
need
to
boast
thy
blood
unspoilt
of
austria
and
thy
heart
unsold
away
from
florence
it
was
understood
god
made
thee
not
too
vigorous
or
too
bold
and
men
had
patience
with
thy
quiet
mood
and
women
pity
as
they
saw
thee
pace
their
festive
streets
with
premature
grey
hairs
we
turned
the
mild
dejection
of
thy
face
to
princely
meanings
took
thy
wrinkling
cares
for
ruffling
hopes
and
called
thee
weak
not
base
nay
better
light
the
torches
for
more
prayers
and
smoke
the
pale
madonnas
at
the
shrine
being
still
our
poor
our
good
who
can
not
help
the
austrian
in
his
line
than
write
an
oath
upon
a
nation
book
for
men
to
spit
at
with
scorn
blurring
brine
who
dares
forgive
what
none
can
overlook
for
me
i
do
repent
me
in
this
dust
of
towns
and
temples
which
makes
italy
i
sigh
amid
the
sighs
which
breathe
a
gust
of
dying
century
to
century
around
us
on
the
uneven
of
these
old
worlds
i
bow
my
soul
and
knee
absolve
me
patriots
of
my
woman
fault
that
ever
i
believed
the
man
was
true
these
sceptred
strangers
shun
the
common
salt
and
therefore
when
the
general
board
in
view
and
they
stand
up
to
carve
for
blind
and
halt
the
wise
suspect
the
viands
which
ensue
i
much
repent
that
in
this
time
and
place
where
many
of
experience
burn
from
cæsar
and
lorenzo
festering
race
to
enlighten
groping
reasoners
i
could
learn
no
better
counsel
for
a
simple
case
than
to
put
faith
in
princes
in
my
turn
had
all
the
of
the
ancient
years
flared
up
in
vain
before
me
knew
i
not
what
stench
arises
from
some
purple
gears
and
how
the
sceptres
witness
whence
they
got
their
crackling
through
the
foul
smoke
by
princely
perjuries
kept
hot
forgive
me
ghosts
of
patriots
brutus
thou
who
trailest
downhill
into
life
again
thy
cloak
to
indict
me
with
thy
slow
reproachful
eyes
for
being
taught
in
vain
that
while
the
illegitimate
cæsars
show
of
meaner
stature
than
the
first
full
strain
confessed
incompetent
to
conquer
gaul
they
swoon
as
feebly
and
cross
rubicons
as
rashly
as
any
julius
of
them
all
forgive
that
i
forgot
the
mind
which
runs
through
absolute
races
too
unsceptical
i
saw
the
man
among
his
little
sons
his
lips
were
warm
with
kisses
while
he
swore
and
i
because
i
am
a
woman
i
who
felt
my
own
child
coming
life
before
the
prescience
of
my
soul
and
held
faith
high
i
could
not
bear
to
think
whoever
bore
that
lips
so
warmed
could
shape
so
cold
a
lie
from
casa
guidi
windows
i
looked
out
again
looked
and
beheld
a
different
sight
the
duke
had
fled
before
the
people
shout
long
live
the
duke
a
people
to
speak
right
must
speak
as
soft
as
courtiers
lest
a
doubt
should
curdle
brows
of
gracious
sovereigns
white
moreover
that
same
dangerous
shouting
meant
some
gratitude
for
future
favours
which
were
only
promised
the
constituent
implied
the
whole
being
subject
to
the
hitch
in
motu
proprios
very
incident
to
all
these
czars
from
paul
to
paulovitch
whereat
the
people
rose
up
in
the
dust
of
the
ruler
flying
feet
and
shouted
still
and
loudly
only
this
time
as
was
just
not
live
the
duke
who
had
fled
for
good
or
ill
but
live
the
people
who
remained
and
must
the
unrenounced
and
unrenounceable
long
live
the
people
how
they
lived
and
boiled
and
bubbled
in
the
cauldron
of
the
street
how
the
young
blustered
nor
the
old
recoiled
and
what
a
thunderous
stir
of
tongues
and
feet
trod
flat
the
palpitating
bells
and
foiled
the
of
their
echo
shattering
it
how
down
they
pulled
the
duke
arms
everywhere
how
up
they
set
new
to
show
where
patriots
might
sip
ices
in
pure
air
the
fresh
paint
smelling
somewhat
to
and
fro
how
marched
the
civic
guard
and
stopped
to
stare
when
boys
broke
windows
in
a
civic
glow
how
rebel
songs
were
sung
to
loyal
tunes
and
bishops
cursed
in
ecclesiastic
metres
how
all
the
circoli
grew
large
as
moons
and
all
the
speakers
moonstruck
thankful
greeters
of
prospects
which
struck
poor
the
ducal
boons
a
mere
free
press
and
chambers
frank
repeaters
of
great
guerazzi
praises
there
a
man
the
father
of
the
land
who
truly
great
takes
off
that
national
disgrace
and
ban
the
farthing
tax
upon
our
and
saves
italia
as
he
only
can
how
all
the
nobles
fled
and
would
not
wait
because
they
were
most
noble
which
being
so
how
liberals
vowed
to
burn
their
palaces
because
free
tuscans
were
not
free
to
go
how
grown
men
raged
at
austria
wickedness
and
smoked
while
fifty
striplings
in
a
row
marched
straight
to
piedmont
for
the
wrong
redress
you
say
we
failed
in
duty
we
who
wore
black
velvet
like
italian
democrats
who
slashed
our
sleeves
like
patriots
nor
forswore
the
true
republic
in
the
form
of
hats
we
chased
the
archbishop
from
the
duomo
door
we
chalked
the
walls
with
bloody
caveats
against
all
tyrants
if
we
did
not
fight
exactly
we
fired
muskets
up
the
air
to
show
that
victory
was
ours
of
right
we
met
had
free
discussion
everywhere
except
perhaps
i
the
chambers
day
and
night
we
proved
the
poor
should
be
employed
that
fair
and
yet
the
rich
not
worked
for
anywise
pay
certified
yet
payers
abrogated
full
work
secured
yet
liabilities
to
overwork
excluded
not
one
bated
of
all
our
holidays
that
still
at
twice
or
thrice
a
week
are
moderately
rated
we
proved
that
austria
was
dislodged
or
would
or
should
be
and
that
tuscany
in
arms
should
would
dislodge
her
ending
the
old
feud
and
yet
to
leave
our
piazzas
shops
and
farms
for
the
simple
sake
of
fighting
was
not
good
we
proved
that
also
did
we
carry
charms
against
being
killed
ourselves
that
we
should
rush
on
killing
others
what
desert
herewith
our
wives
and
mothers
was
that
duty
tush
at
which
we
shook
the
sword
within
the
sheath
like
heroes
only
louder
and
the
flush
ran
up
the
cheek
to
meet
the
future
wreath
nay
what
we
proved
we
shouted
how
we
shouted
especially
the
boys
did
boldly
planting
that
tree
of
liberty
whose
fruit
is
doubted
because
the
roots
are
not
of
nature
granting
a
tree
of
good
and
evil
none
without
it
grow
gods
alas
and
with
it
men
are
wanting
o
holy
knowledge
holy
liberty
o
holy
rights
of
nations
if
i
speak
these
bitter
things
against
the
jugglery
of
days
that
in
your
names
proved
blind
and
weak
it
is
that
tears
are
bitter
when
we
see
the
brown
skulls
grin
at
death
in
churchyards
bleak
we
do
not
cry
this
yorick
is
too
light
for
death
grows
deathlier
with
that
mouth
he
makes
so
with
my
mocking
bitter
things
i
write
because
my
soul
is
bitter
for
your
sakes
o
freedom
o
my
florence
men
who
might
do
greatly
in
a
universe
that
breaks
and
burns
must
ever
before
they
do
courage
and
patience
are
but
sacrifice
and
sacrifice
is
offered
for
and
to
something
conceived
of
each
man
pays
a
price
for
what
himself
counts
precious
whether
true
or
false
the
appreciation
it
implies
but
here
no
knowledge
no
conception
nought
desire
was
absent
that
provides
great
deeds
from
out
the
greatness
of
prevenient
thought
and
action
action
like
a
flame
that
needs
a
steady
breath
and
fuel
being
caught
up
like
a
burning
reed
from
other
reeds
flashed
in
the
empty
and
uncertain
air
then
wavered
then
went
out
behold
who
blames
a
crooked
course
when
not
a
goal
is
there
to
round
the
fervid
striving
of
the
games
an
ignorance
of
means
may
minister
to
greatness
but
an
ignorance
of
aims
makes
it
impossible
to
be
great
at
all
so
with
our
tuscans
let
none
dare
to
say
here
virtue
never
can
be
national
here
fortitude
can
never
cut
a
way
between
the
austrian
muskets
out
of
thrall
i
tell
you
rather
that
whoever
may
discern
true
ends
here
shall
grow
pure
enough
to
love
them
brave
enough
to
strive
for
them
and
strong
to
reach
them
though
the
roads
be
rough
that
having
learnt
by
no
mere
apophthegm
not
just
the
draping
of
a
graceful
stuff
about
a
statue
broidered
at
the
hem
not
just
the
trilling
on
an
of
libertà
to
bravos
a
fair
word
yet
too
allied
to
inarticulate
rage
and
breathless
sobs
for
singing
though
the
chord
were
deeper
than
they
struck
it
but
the
gauge
of
civil
wants
sustained
and
wrongs
abhorred
the
serious
sacred
meaning
and
full
use
of
freedom
for
a
nation
then
indeed
our
tuscans
underneath
the
bloody
dews
of
some
new
morning
rising
up
agreed
and
bold
will
want
no
saxon
souls
or
thews
to
sweep
their
piazzas
clear
of
austria
breed
alas
alas
it
was
not
so
this
time
conviction
was
not
courage
failed
and
truth
was
something
to
be
doubted
of
the
mime
changed
masks
because
a
mime
the
tide
as
smooth
in
running
in
as
out
no
sense
of
crime
because
no
sense
of
virtue
sudden
ruth
seized
on
the
people
they
would
have
again
their
good
and
leave
guerazzi
though
he
took
that
tax
from
florence
much
in
vain
he
takes
it
from
the
we
trow
while
urgent
that
no
remain
but
all
march
off
and
leave
the
spade
and
plough
to
die
among
the
lombards
was
it
thus
the
dear
paternal
duke
did
live
the
duke
at
which
the
multitudinous
swept
by
an
opposite
wind
as
loudly
shook
call
back
the
mild
archbishop
to
his
house
to
bless
the
people
with
his
frightened
look
he
shall
not
yet
be
hanged
you
comprehend
seize
on

guard
him
in
full
view
or
else
we
stab
him
in
the
back
to
end
rub
out
those
chalked
devices
set
up
new
the
duke
arms
doff
your
phrygian
caps
and
men
the
pavement
of
the
piazzas
broke
into
by
barren
poles
of
freedom
smooth
the
way
for
the
ducal
carriage
lest
his
highness
sigh
here
trees
of
liberty
grew
yesterday
long
live
the
duke
how
roared
the
cannonry
how
rocked
the
and
through
thickening
spray
of
nosegays
wreaths
and
kerchiefs
tossed
on
high
how
marched
the
civic
guard
the
people
still
being
good
at
shouts
especially
the
boys
alas
poor
people
of
an
unfledged
will
most
fitly
expressed
by
such
a
callow
voice
alas
still
poorer
duke
incapable
of
being
worthy
even
of
so
much
noise
you
think
he
came
back
instantly
with
thanks
and
tears
in
his
faint
eyes
and
hands
extended
to
stretch
the
franchise
through
their
utmost
ranks
that
having
like
a
father
apprehended
he
came
to
pardon
fatherly
those
pranks
played
out
and
now
in
filial
service
ended
that
some
like
a
prince
he
threw
to
meet
the
people
in
return
well
how
he
came
i
will
relate
to
you
and
if
your
hearts
should
burn
why
hearts
burn
to
make
the
ashes
which
things
old
and
new
shall
be
washed
clean
in
as
this
duke
will
learn
from
casa
guidi
windows
gazing
then
i
saw
and
witness
how
the
duke
came
back
the
regular
tramp
of
horse
and
tread
of
men
did
smite
the
silence
like
an
anvil
black
and
sparkless
with
her
wide
eyes
at
full
strain
our
tuscan
nurse
exclaimed
alack
alack
signora
these
shall
be
the
austrians
nay
be
still
i
answered
do
not
wake
the
child
for
so
my
baby
sleeping
lay
in
milky
dreams
upon
the
bed
and
smiled
and
i
thought
he
shall
sleep
on
while
he
may
through
the
world
baseness
not
being
yet
defiled
why
should
he
be
disturbed
by
what
is
done
then
gazing
i
beheld
the
street
live
out
from
end
to
end
full
in
the
sun
with
austria
thousand
sword
and
bayonet
horse
foot
artillery
cannons
rolling
on
like
blind
slow
gestant
with
the
heat
of
undeveloped
lightnings
each
bestrode
by
a
single
man
from
head
to
heel
indifferent
as
the
dreadful
thing
he
rode
like
a
sculptured
fate
serene
and
terrible
as
some
smooth
river
which
has
overflowed
will
slow
and
silent
down
its
current
wheel
a
loosened
forest
all
the
pines
erect
so
swept
in
mute
significance
of
storm
the
marshalled
thousands
not
an
eye
deflect
to
left
or
right
to
catch
a
novel
form
of
florence
city
adorned
by
architect
and
carver
or
of
beauties
live
and
warm
scared
at
the
casements
all
straightforward
eyes
and
faces
held
as
steadfast
as
their
swords
and
cognizant
of
acts
not
imageries
the
key
o
tuscans
too
well
fits
the
wards
ye
asked
for
mimes
these
bring
you
tragedies
for
purple
these
shall
wear
it
as
your
lords
ye
played
like
children
die
like
innocents
ye
mimicked
lightnings
with
a
torch
the
crack
of
the
actual
bolt
your
pastime
circumvents
ye
called
up
ghosts
believing
they
were
slack
to
follow
any
voice
from
gilboa
tents
here
samuel
and
so
come
back
and
yet
they
are
no
prophets
though
they
come
that
awful
mantle
they
are
drawing
close
shall
be
searched
one
day
by
the
shafts
of
doom
through
double
folds
now
hoodwinking
the
brows
resuscitated
monarchs
disentomb
with
them
in
their
new
let
such
beware
behold
the
people
waits
like
god
as
he
in
his
serene
of
might
so
they
in
their
endurance
of
long
straits
ye
stamp
no
nation
out
though
day
and
night
ye
tread
them
with
that
absolute
heel
which
grates
and
grinds
them
flat
from
all
attempted
height
you
kill
worms
sooner
with
a
than
you
kill
peoples
peoples
will
not
die
the
tail
curls
stronger
when
you
lop
the
head
they
writhe
at
every
wound
and
multiply
and
shudder
into
a
heap
of
life
that
made
thus
vital
from
god
own
vitality
is
hard
to
shrivel
back
a
day
of
once
fixed
for
judgment
is
as
hard
to
change
the
peoples
when
they
rise
beneath
their
loads
and
heave
them
from
their
backs
with
violent
wrench
to
crush
the
oppressor
for
that
the
measure
of
this
popular
revenge
meanwhile
from
casa
guidi
windows
we
beheld
the
armament
of
austria
flow
into
the
drowning
heart
of
tuscany
and
yet
none
wept
none
cursed
or
if
was
so
they
wept
and
cursed
in
silence
silently
our
noisy
tuscans
watched
the
invading
foe
they
had
learnt
silence
pressed
against
the
wall
and
grouped
upon
the
opposite
a
few
pale
men
and
women
stared
at
all
god
knows
what
they
were
feeling
with
their
white
constrainèd
faces
they
so
prodigal
of
cry
and
gesture
when
the
world
goes
right
or
wrong
indeed
but
here
was
depth
of
wrong
and
here
still
water
they
were
silent
here
and
through
that
sentient
silence
struck
along
that
measured
tramp
from
which
it
stood
out
clear
distinct
the
sound
and
silence
like
a
gong
at
midnight
each
by
the
other
awfuller
while
every
soldier
in
his
cap
displayed
a
leaf
of
olive
dusty
bitter
thing
was
such
plucked
at
novara
is
it
said
a
cry
is
up
in
england
which
doth
ring
the
hollow
world
through
that
for
ends
of
trade
and
virtue
and
god
better
worshipping
we
henceforth
should
exalt
the
name
of
peace
and
leave
those
rusty
wars
that
eat
the
soul
besides
their
clippings
at
our
golden
fleece
i
too
have
loved
peace
and
from
bole
to
bole
of
immemorial
undeciduous
trees
would
write
as
lovers
use
upon
a
scroll
the
holy
name
of
peace
and
set
it
high
where
none
could
pluck
it
down
on
trees
i
say
not
upon
gibbets
with
the
greenery
of
dewy
branches
and
the
flowery
may
sweet
mediation
betwixt
earth
and
sky
providing
for
the
shepherd
holiday
not
upon
gibbets
though
the
vulture
leaves
the
bones
to
quiet
which
he
first
picked
bare
not
upon
dungeons
though
the
wretch
who
grieves
and
groans
within
less
stirs
the
outer
air
than
any
little
stirs
the
sheaves
not
upon
though
the
slave
despair
has
dulled
his
helpless
miserable
brain
and
left
him
blank
beneath
the
freeman
whip
to
sing
and
laugh
out
idiocies
of
pain
nor
yet
on
starving
homes
where
many
a
lip
has
sobbed
itself
asleep
through
curses
vain
i
love
no
peace
which
is
not
fellowship
and
which
includes
not
mercy
i
would
have
rather
the
raking
of
the
guns
across
the
world
and
shrieks
against
heaven
architrave
rather
the
struggle
in
the
slippery
fosse
of
dying
men
and
horses
and
the
wave
enough
said
by
christ
own
cross
and
by
this
faint
heart
of
my
womanhood
such
things
are
better
than
a
peace
that
sits
beside
a
hearth
in
mood
and
takes
no
thought
how
wind
and
rain
by
fits
are
howling
out
of
doors
against
the
good
of
the
poor
wanderer
what
your
peace
admits
of
outside
anguish
while
it
keeps
at
home
i
loathe
to
take
its
name
upon
my
tongue
is
nowise
peace
is
treason
stiff
with
doom
is
gagged
despair
and
inarticulate
wrong
annihilated
poland
stifled
rome
dazed
naples
hungary
fainting
the
thong
and
austria
wearing
a
smooth
on
her
brute
forehead
while
her
hoofs
outpress
the
life
from
these
italian
souls
in
brief
o
lord
of
peace
who
art
lord
of
righteousness
constrain
the
anguished
worlds
from
sin
and
grief
pierce
them
with
conscience
purge
them
with
redress
and
give
us
peace
which
is
no
counterfeit
but
wherefore
should
we
look
out
any
more
from
casa
guidi
windows
shut
them
straight
and
let
us
sit
down
by
the
folded
door
and
veil
our
saddened
faces
and
so
wait
what
next
the
make
ready
for
i
have
grown
too
weary
of
these
windows
sights
come
thick
enough
and
clear
enough
in
thought
without
the
sunshine
souls
have
inner
lights
and
since
the
has
come
back
and
brought
this
army
of
the
north
which
thus
requites
his
filial
south
we
leave
him
to
be
taught
his
south
too
has
learnt
something
certainly
whereof
the
practice
will
bring
profit
soon
and
peradventure
other
eyes
may
see
from
casa
guidi
windows
what
is
done
or
undone
whatsoever
deeds
they
be
pope
pius
will
be
glorified
in
none

top

heights
of

so
named
shall
lure
no
vessel
any
more
to
drop
among

breakers
peter
chair
is
shamed
like
any
vulgar
throne
the
nations
lop
to
pieces
for
their
firewood
unreclaimed
and
when
it
burns
too
we
shall
see
as
well
in
italy
as
elsewhere
let
it
burn
the
cross
accounted
still
adorable
is
christ
cross
only
if
the
thief
would
earn
some
stealthy
genuflexions
we
rebel
and
here
the
impenitent
thief
has
had
its
turn
as
god
knows
and
the
people
on
their
knees
scoff
and
toss
back
the
crosiers
stretched
like
yokes
to
press
their
heads
down
lower
by
degrees
so
italy
by
means
of
these
last
strokes
escapes
the
danger
which
preceded
these
of
leaving
captured
hands
in
cloven
oaks
of
leaving
very
souls
within
the
buckle
whence
bodies
struggled
outward
of
supposing
that
freemen
may
like
bondsmen
kneel
and
truckle
and
then
stand
up
as
usual
without
losing
an
inch
of
stature
those
whom
suckle
will
bite
as
wolves
do
in
the
of
adverse
interests
this
at
last
is
known
thank
pius
for
the
lesson
that
albeit
among

the

still
thinking
of

not

we

no

at

she
felt
her
little

unborn
recoil
within
her
from
the
violent
staves
and
bloodhounds
of
the
world
at
which
her
life
dropt
inwards
from
her
eyes
and
followed
it
beyond

garibaldi
wife

died
so
and
now
the

fit
her
body
like
a

coif
and
murmurously

grit
the

while
she
lies
interred
in

ere

thus
she
looked
up
in
his
face
which
never
stirred
from
its
clenched
anguish
as
to
make
excuse
for
leaving
him
for
his
if
so
she
erred
he
well
remembers
that
she
could
not
choose
a

another

there
a

may

of

that
he
could
not

though
thrice
into
the

for
this
he
plunged
his
shuddering
steed

felt
the
sky
reel
back
between
the
stripped
away
the
ancestral
ermine
ere
the
smoke
had
cleared
and
naked
to
the
soul
that
none
might
say
his
kingship
covered
what
was
base
and
bleared
with
treason
went
out
straight
an
exile
yea
an
exiled
patriot
let
him
be
revered
yea
verily
charles
albert
has
died
well
and
if
he
lived
not
all
so
as
one
spoke
the
sin
pass
softly
with
the
for
he
was
shriven
i
think
in
and
taking
off
his
crown
made
visible
a
hero
forehead
shaking
austria
yoke
he
shattered
his
own
hand
and
heart
so
best
his
last
words
were
upon
his
lonely
bed
i
do
not
end
like
popes
and
dukes
at
least
thank
god
for
it
and
now
that
he
is
dead
admitting
it
is
proved
and
manifest
that
he
was
worthy
with
a
discrowned
head
to
measure
heights
with
patriots
let
them
stand
beside
the
man
in
his
oporto
shroud
and
each
vouchsafe
to
take
him
by
the
hand
and
kiss
him
on
the
cheek
and
say
aloud
thou
too
hast
suffered
for
our
native
land
my
brother
thou
art
one
of

be

has
she

nothing

from

nothing

yes

life
throbs
in

piedmont
while
the

grow

and
as

will
soon
be
shovelled
off

to
leave
the

free
in

and
i
who
first
took
hope
up
in
this
song
because
a

was
singing
one
behold
the
hope
and
omen
were
not
haply
wrong
poets
are
soothsayers

up
the

stand
out
in
it
my
own
young
florentine
not
two
years
old
and
let
me
see
thee
more
it
grows
along
thy
amber
curls
to
shine
brighter
than
elsewhere
now
look
straight
before
and
fix
thy
brave
blue
english
eyes
on
mine
and
from
my
soul
which
fronts
the
future
so
with
unabashed
and
unabated
gaze
teach
me
to
hope
for
what
the
angels
know
when
they
smile
clear
as
thou
dost
down
god
ways
with
just
alighted
feet
between
the
snow
and
snowdrops
where
a
little
lamb
may
graze
thou
hast
no
fear
my
lamb
about
the
road
albeit
in
our
we
assume
that
less
than
we
have
thou
hast
learnt
of

prophet
thou
to
whom
the
earliest
light
that
ever
flowed
through
casa
guidi
windows
chanced
to
come
now
shake
the
glittering
nimbus
of
thy
hair
and
be
god
witness
that
the
elemental
new
springs
of
life
are
gushing
everywhere
to
cleanse
the
watercourses
and
prevent
all
concrete
obstructions
which
infest
the
air
that
earth
alive
and
gentle
or
ungentle
motions
within
her
signify
but
growth
the
ground
swells
greenest
the
labouring
moles
the
uneasy
world
is
vexed
and
wroth
young
children
lifted
high
on
parent
souls
look
round
them
with
a
smile
upon
the
mouth
and
take
for
music
every
bell
that
tolls
who
said
we
should
be
better
if
like
these
but
sit
murmuring
for
the
future
though
posterity
is
smiling
on
our

convicting
us
of
folly
let
us
go
we
will
trust

the
blank
interstices

rare
or
knit
across
with
generous
arches
till
the
fane
complete
this
world
has
no
perdition
if
some
loss
such
cheer
i
gather
from
thy
smiling
sweet
the
which
emboss
the
vail
lean
inward
to
the
footnotes
see
the
opening
passage
of
the
agamemnon
of
æschylus
philostratus
relates
of
apollonius
how
he
objected
to
the
musical
instrument
of
linus
the
rhodian
that
it
could
not
enrich
or
beautify
the
history
of
music
in
our
day
would
satisfy
the
philosopher
on
one
point
at
least
poems
before
congress
preface
these
poems
were
written
under
the
pressure
of
the
events
they
indicate
after
a
residence
in
italy
of
so
many
years
that
the
present
triumph
of
great
principles
is
heightened
to
the
writer
feelings
by
the
disastrous
issue
of
the
last
movement
witnessed
from
casa
guidi
windows
in
yet
if
the
verses
should
appear
to
english
readers
too
pungently
rendered
to
admit
of
a
patriotic
respect
to
the
english
sense
of
things
i
will
not
excuse
myself
on
such
grounds
nor
on
the
ground
of
my
attachment
to
the
italian
people
and
my
admiration
of
their
heroic
constancy
and
union
what
i
have
written
has
simply
been
written
because
i
love
truth
and
justice
more
than
plato
and
plato
country
more
than
dante
and
dante
country
more
even
than
shakespeare
and
shakespeare
country
and
if
patriotism
means
the
flattery
of
one
nation
in
every
case
then
the
patriot
take
it
as
you
please
is
merely
the
courtier
which
i
am
not
though
i
have
written
napoleon
iii
in
italy
it
is
time
to
limit
the
significance
of
certain
terms
or
to
enlarge
the
significance
of
certain
things
nationality
is
excellent
in
its
place
and
the
instinct
of
is
the
root
of
a
man
which
will
develop
into
sacrificial
virtues
but
all
the
virtues
are
means
and
uses
and
if
we
hinder
their
tendency
to
growth
and
expansion
we
both
destroy
them
as
virtues
and
degrade
them
to
that
rankest
species
of
corruption
reserved
for
the
most
noble
organizations
for
instance
in
the
affairs
of
neighbouring
states
is
a
high
political
virtue
but
does
not
mean
passing
by
on
the
other
side
when
your
neighbour
falls
among
thieves
or
phariseeism
would
recover
it
from
christianity
freedom
itself
is
virtue
as
well
as
privilege
but
freedom
of
the
seas
does
not
mean
piracy
nor
freedom
of
the
land
brigandage
nor
freedom
of
the
senate
freedom
to
cudgel
a
dissident
member
nor
freedom
of
the
press
freedom
to
calumniate
and
lie
so
if
patriotism
be
a
virtue
indeed
it
can
not
mean
an
exclusive
devotion
to
our
interests
for
that
is
only
another
form
of
devotion
to
personal
interests
family
interests
or
provincial
interests
all
of
which
if
not
driven
past
themselves
are
vulgar
and
immoral
objects
let
us
put
away
the
little
peddlingtonism
unworthy
of
a
great
nation
and
too
prevalent
among
us
if
the
man
who
does
not
look
beyond
this
natural
life
is
of
a
somewhat
narrow
order
what
must
be
the
man
who
does
not
look
beyond
his
own
frontier
or
his
own
sea
i
confess
that
i
dream
of
the
day
when
an
english
statesman
shall
arise
with
a
heart
too
large
for
england
having
courage
in
the
face
of
his
countrymen
to
assert
of
some
suggested

another

we

so

shall
it
must
it
be
that
after

has
broken
she
will
die
off

like

sung
of
her
sad
at

because
her
name
is
italy
die
and
count
no
friend
is
it
true
may
it
be
spoken
that
she
who
has
lain
so
still
with
a
wound
in
her
breast
and
a
flower
in
her
hand
and
a
under
her
head
while
every
nation
at

beside
her
has
dared
to
stand
and
flout
her
with
pity
and
scorn
saying
she
is
at
rest
she
is
fair
she
is
dead
and
leaving
room
in
her
stead
to
us
who
are
later
born
this
is
certainly
best
saying
alas
she
is
fair
very
fair
but
dead
give
place
and
so
we
have
room
for
the
race
can
it
be
true
be
true
that
she
lives
anew
that
she
rises
up
at
the
shout
of
her
sons
at
the
trumpet
of
france
and
lives
anew
is
it
true
that
she
has
not
moved
in
a
trance
as
in
when
her
eyes
were
troubled
with
blood
till
she
knew
not
friend
from
foe
till
her
hand
was
caught
in
a
strait
of
her
cerement
and
baffled
so
from
doing
the
deed
she
would
and
her
weak
foot
stumbled
across
the
grave
of
a
king
and
down
she
dropt
at
heavy
loss
and
we
gloomily
covered
her
face
and
said
we
have
dreamed
the
thing
she
is
not
alive
but
dead
vii
now
shall
we
say
our
italy
lives
indeed
and
if
it
were
not
for
the
beat
and
bray
of

and
trump
of
martial
men
should
we
feel
the
underground
heave
and
strain
where
heroes
left
their
dust
as
a
seed
sure
to
emerge
one
day
and
if
it
were
not
for
the
rhythmic
march
of
france
and
piedmont
double

should
we
hear
the
ghosts
thrill
through

arch
throb
along
the

an

by
that
divine
they
left

italy
is
not
dead
at
all
ay
if
it
were
not
for
the
tears
in
our
eyes

tears
of
a

we

buying

piling

upon

evermore
and
last
season
when
the
french
camp
had
its
station
in
the
things
quickened
and
grew
gayer
through
the
mingling
of
the
liberating
nation
with
this
people
groups
of
frenchmen
everywhere
strolling
gazing
judging
lightly
who
was
fair

then
the

took

her
to
speak
nobly
from
her
carriage
for
the
rest
pray
these
officers
from
france
to
do
us
honour
by
dancing
with
us
straightway
the
request
was
gravely
apprehended
as
addressed
vii
and
the
men
of
france
bareheaded
bowing
lowly
led
out
each
a
proud
signora
to
the
space
which
the
startled
crowd
had
rounded
for
them
slowly
just
a
touch
of
still
emotion
in
his
face
not
presuming
through
the
symbol
on
the
grace
viii
there
was
silence
in
the
people
some
lips
trembled
but
none
jested
broke
the
music
at
a
glance
and
the
daughters
of
our
princes
thus
assembled
stepped
the
measure
with
the
gallant
sons
of
france
hush
it
might
have
been
a
mass
and
not
a
dance
ix
and
they
danced
there
till
the
blue
that
overskied
us
swooned
with
passion
though
the
footing
seemed
sedate
and
the
mountains
heaving
mighty
hearts
beside
us
sighed
a
rapture
in
a
shadow
to
dilate
and
touch
the
holy
stone
where
dante
sate
x
then
the
sons
of
france
bareheaded
lowly
bowing
led
the
ladies
back
where
kinsmen
of
the
south
stood
received
them
till
with
burst
of
overflowing
feeling
husbands
brothers
florence
male
youth
turned
and
kissed
the
martial
strangers
mouth

xi
and
a
cry
went
up
a
cry
from
all
that
people
you
have
heard
a
people
cheering
you
suppose
for
the
member
mayor
with
chorus
from
the
steeple
this
was
different
scarce
as
loud
perhaps
who
knows
for
we
saw
wet
eyes
around
us
ere
the
close
xii
and
we
felt
as
if
a
nation
too
long
borne
in
by
hard
wrongers
comprehending
in
such
attitude
that
god
had
spoken
somewhere
since
the
morning
that
men
were
somehow
brothers
by
no
platitude
cried
exultant
in
great
wonder
and
free
gratitude
a
tale
of
villafranca
told
in
tuscany
i
my
little
son
my
florentine
sit
down
beside
my
knee
and
i
will
tell
you
why
the
sign
of
joy
which
flushed
our
italy
has
faded
since
but
yesternight
and
why
your
florence
of
delight
is
mourning
as
you
see
ii
a
great
man
who
was
crowned
one
day
imagined
a
great
deed
he
shaped
it
out
of
cloud
and
clay
he
touched
it
finely
till
the
seed
possessed
the
flower
from
heart
and
brain
he
fed
it
with
large
thoughts
humane
to
help
a
people
need
iii
he
brought
it
out
into
the
sun
they
blessed
it
to
his
face
o
great
pure
deed
that
hast
undone
so
many
bad
and
base
o
generous
deed
heroic
deed
come
forth
be
perfected

deliver
by

grace
iv
then
sovereigns
statesmen
north
and
south
rose
up
in
wrath
and
fear
and
cried
protesting
by
one
mouth
what
monster
have
we
here
a
great
deed
at
this
hour
of
day
a
great
just
deed
and
not
for
pay
absurd
or
insincere
and
if
sincere
the
heavier
blow
in
that
case
we
shall
bear
for
where
our
blessed
quo
our
holy
treaties
where
our
rights
to
sell
a
race
or
buy
protect
and
pillage
occupy
and
civilize
despair
vi
some
muttered
that
the
great
deed
meant
a
great
pretext
to
sin
and
others
the
pretext
so
lent
was
heinous
to
begin
volcanic
terms
of
great
and
just
admit
such
tongues
of
flame
the
crust
of
time
and
law
falls
in
vii
a
great
deed
in
this
world
of
ours
unheard
of
the
pretence
is
it
threatens
plainly
the
great
powers
is
fatal
in
all
senses
a
just
deed
in
the
world
call
out
the
rifles
be
not
slack
about
the
national
defences
viii
and
many
murmured
from
this
source
what
red
blood
must
be
poured
and
some
rejoined
is
even
worse
what
red
tape
is
ignored
all
cursed

doer
for
an
evil
called

said

could

gathered
her
up
in

straight
in

she
to

went
at

hope

two

all
that

came

a
tear
for

turned
as
in

stooped
to
his

a
curse
for
a
nation
prologue
i
heard
an
angel
speak
last
night
and
he
said
write
write
a
nation
curse
for
me
and
send
it
over
the
western
sea
i
faltered
taking
up
the
word
not
so
my
lord
if
curses
must
be
choose
another
to
send
thy
curse
against
my
brother
for
i
am
bound
by
gratitude
by
love
and
blood
to
brothers
of
mine
across
the
sea
who
stretch
out
kindly
hands
to
me
therefore
the
voice
said
shalt
thou
write
my
curse
from
the
summits
of
love
a
curse
is
driven
as
lightning
is
from
the
tops
of
heaven
not
so
i
answered
evermore
my
heart
is
sore
for
my
own
land
sins
for
little
feet
of
children
bleeding
along
the
street
for
honours
that
gainsay
the
right
of
way
for
almsgiving
through
a
door
that
is
not
open
enough
for
two
friends
to
kiss
for
love
of
freedom
which
abates
beyond
the
straits
for
patriot
virtue
starved
to
vice
on
and
suspicion
for
an
oligarchic
parliament
and
bribes
what
curse
to
another
land
assign
when
for
the
sins
of
mine
therefore
the
voice
said
shalt
thou
write
my
curse
because
thou
hast
strength
to
see
and
hate
a
foul
thing
done
thy
gate
not
so
i
answered
once
again
to
curse
choose
men
for
i
a
woman
have
only
known
how
the
heart
melts
and
the
tears
run
down
therefore
the
voice
said
shalt
thou
write
my
curse
some
women
weep
and
curse
i
say
and
no
one
marvels
night
and
day
and
thou
shalt
take
their
part
weep
and
write
a
curse
from
the
depths
of
womanhood
is
very
salt
and
bitter
and
good
so
thus
i
wrote
and
mourned
indeed
what
all
may
read
and
thus
as
was
enjoined
on
me
i
send
it
over
the
western
sea
the
curse
i
because
ye
have
broken
your
own
chain
with
the
strain
of
brave
men
climbing
a
nation
height
yet
thence
bear
down
with
brand
and
thong
on
souls
of
others
for
this
wrong
this
is
the
curse
write
because
yourselves
are
standing
straight
in
the
state
of
freedom
foremost
acolyte
yet
keep
calm
footing
all
the
time
on
writhing
for
this
crime
this
is
the
curse
write
because
ye
prosper
in
god
name
with
a
claim
to
honour
in
the
old
world
sight
yet
do
the
fiend
work
perfectly
in
strangling
martyrs
for
this
lie
this
is
the
curse
write
ii
ye
shall
watch
while
kings
conspire
round
the
people
smouldering
fire
and
warm
for
your
part
shall
never
dare
o
shame
to
utter
the
thought
into
flame
which
burns
at
your
heart
this
is
the
curse
write
ye
shall
watch
while
nations
strive
with
the
bloodhounds
die
or
survive
drop
faint
from
their
jaws
or
throttle
them
backward
to
death
and
only
under
your
breath
shall
favour
the
cause
this
is
the
curse
write
ye
shall
watch
while
strong
men
draw
the
nets
of
feudal
law
to
strangle
the
weak
and
counting
the
sin
for
a
sin
your
soul
shall
be
sadder
within
than
the
word
ye
shall
speak
this
is
the
curse
write
when
good
men
are
praying
erect
that
christ
may
avenge
his
elect
and
deliver
the
earth
the
prayer
in
your
ears
said
low
shall
sound
like
the
tramp
of
a
foe
that
driving
you
forth
this
is
the
curse
write
when
wise
men
give
you
their
praise
they
shall
pause
in
the
heat
of
the
phrase
as
if
carried
too
far
when
ye
boast
your
own
charters
kept
true
ye
shall
blush
for
the
thing
which
ye
do
derides
what
ye
are
this
is
the
curse
write
when
fools
cast
taunts
at
your
gate
your
scorn
ye
shall
somewhat
abate
as
ye
look
the
wall
for
your
conscience
tradition
and
name
explode
with
a
deadlier
blame
than
the
worst
of
them
all
this
is
the
curse
write
go
wherever
ill
deeds
shall
be
done
go
plant
your
flag
in
the
sun
beside
the
and
recoil
from
clenching
the
curse
of

upon
thee
my
sweet
two
loves
led
thee
out
to
the
sun
alas
pretty
hands
pretty
feet
if
the
one
who
remains
only
one
set
her
grief
at
thee
turned
in
a
heat
to
thine
enemy
were
it
well
done
sleep
xi
may
he
of
the
manger
stand
near
and
love
thee
an
infant
he
came
to
his
own
who
rejected
him
here
but
the
magi
brought
gifts
all
the
same
hurry
the
cross
on
my
dear
gifts
are
the
griefs
i
declaim
sleep
lord
walter
wife
i
but
why
do
you
go
said
the
lady
while
both
sat
under
the
yew
and
her
eyes
were
alive
in
their
depth
as
the
kraken
beneath
the
ii
because
i
fear
you
he
answered
because
you
are
far
too
fair
and
able
to
strangle
my
soul
in
a
mesh
of
your
hair
iii
oh
that
she
said
is
no
reason
such
knots
are
quickly
undone
and
too
much
beauty
i
reckon
is
nothing
but
too
much
sun
iv
yet
farewell
so
he
answered
the
fatal
at
times
i
value
your
husband
lord
walter
whose
gallop
rings
still
from
the
limes
oh
that
she
said
is
no
reason
you
smell
a
rose
through
a
fence
if
two
should
smell
it
what
matter
who
grumbles
and
where
the
pretence
vi
but
i
he
replied
have
promised
another
when
love
was
free
to
love
her
alone
alone
who
alone
and
afar
loves
me
vii
why
that
she
said
is
no
reason
love
always
free
i
am
told
will
you
vow
to
be
safe
from
the
headache
on
tuesday
and
think
it
will
hold
viii
but
you
he
replied
have
a
daughter
a
young
little
child
who
was
laid
in
your
lap
to
be
pure
so
i
leave
you
the
angels
would
make
me
afraid
ix
oh
that
she
said
is
no
reason
the
angels
keep
out
of
the
way
and
dora
the
child
observes
nothing
although
you
should
please
me
and
stay
x
at
which
he
rose
up
in
his
anger
why
now
you
no
longer
are
fair
why
now
you
no
longer
are
fatal
but
ugly
and
hateful
i
swear
xi
at
which
she
laughed
out
in
her
scorn
these
men
oh
these
men
overnice
who
are
shocked
if
a
colour
not
virtuous
is
frankly
put
on
by
a
vice
xii
her
eyes
blazed
upon
him
and
you
bring
us
your
vices
so
near
that
we
smell
them
you
think
in
our
presence
a
thought
would
defame
us
to
hear
xiii
what
reason
had
you
and
what
right
i
appeal
to
your
soul
from
my
life
to
find
me
too
fair
as
a
woman
why
sir
i
am
pure
and
a
wife
xiv
is
the
too
fair
up
above
you
it
burns
you
not
dare
you
imply
i
brushed
you
more
close
than
the
star
does
when
walter
had
set
me
as
high
xv
if
a
man
finds
a
woman
too
fair
he
means
simply
adapted
too
much
to
uses
unlawful
and
fatal
the
praise
shall
i
thank
you
for
such
xvi
too
fair
not
unless
you
misuse
us
and
surely
if
once
in
a
while
you
attain
to
it
straightway
you
call
us
no
longer
too
fair
but
too
vile
xvii
a
moment
i
pray
your
attention
i
have
a
poor
word
in
my
head
i
must
utter
though
womanly
custom
would
set
it
down
better
unsaid
xviii
you
grew
sir
pale
to
impertinence
once
when
i
showed
you
a
ring
you
kissed
my
fan
when
i
dropped
it
no
matter
i
broken
the
thing
xix
you
did
me
the
honour
perhaps
to
be
moved
at
my
side
now
and
then
in
the
senses
a
vice
i
have
heard
which
is
common
to
beasts
and
some
men
xx
love
a
virtue
for
heroes
as
white
as
the
snow
on
high
hills
and
immortal
as
every
great
soul
is
that
struggles
endures
and
fulfils
xxi
i
love
my
walter
profoundly
you
maude
though
you
faltered
a
week
for
the
sake
of
what
was
it
an
eyebrow
or
less
still
a
mole
on
a
cheek
xxii
and
since
when
all
said
you
too
noble
to
stoop
to
the
frivolous
cant
about
crimes
irresistible
virtues
that
swindle
betray
and
supplant
xxiii
i
determined
to
prove
to
yourself
that
you
might
dream
or
avow
by
illusion
you
wanted
precisely
no
more
of
me
than
you
have
now
xxiv
there
look
me
full
in
the
face
in
the
face
understand
if
you
can
that
the
eyes
of
such
women
as
i
am
are
clean
as
the
palm
of
a
man
xxv
drop
his
hand
you
insult
him
avoid
us
for
fear
we
should
cost
you
a
scar
you
take
us
for
harlots
i
tell
you
and
not
for
the
women
we
are
xxvi
you
wronged
me
but
then
i
considered
there
walter
and
so
at
the
end
i
vowed
that
he
should
not
be
mulcted
by
me
in
the
hand
of
a
friend
xxvii
have
i
hurt
you
indeed
we
are
quits
then
nay
friend
of
my
walter
be
mine
come
dora
my
darling
my
angel
and
help
me
to
ask
him
to
dine
bianca
among
the
nightingales
i
the
cypress
stood
up
like
a
church
that
night
we
felt
our
love
would
hold
and
saintly
moonlight
seemed
to
search
and
wash
the
whole
world
clean
as
gold
the
olives
crystallized
the
broad
slopes
until
the
hills
grew
strong
the
and
the
nightingales
throbbed
each
to
either
flame
and
song
the
nightingales
the
nightingales
ii
upon
the
angle
of
its
shade
the
cypress
stood
high
half
up
half
down
as
along
the
ground
against
the
sky
and
too
from
such
went
such
leaps
of
blood
so
blindly
driven
we
scarce
knew
if
our
nature
meant
most
passionate
earth
or
intense
heaven
the
nightingales
the
nightingales
iii
we
paled
with
love
we
shook
with
love
we
kissed
so
close
we
could
not
vow
till
giulio
whispered
sweet
above
god
ever
guaranties
this
now
and
through
his
words
the
nightingales
drove
straight
and
full
their
long
clear
call
like
arrows
through
heroic
mails
and
love
was
awful
in
it
all
the
nightingales
the
nightingales
iv
o
cold
white
moonlight
of
the
north
refresh
these
pulses
quench
this
hell
o
coverture
of
death
drawn
forth
across
this
well
but
what
have
nightingales
to
do
in
gloomy
england
called
the
free
yes
free
to
die
in
when
we
two
are
sundered
singing
still
to
me
and
still
they
sing
the
nightingales
i
think
i
hear
him
how
he
cried
my
own
soul
life
between
their
notes
each
man
has
but
one
soul
supplied
and
that
immortal
though
his
on
fire
with
passion
now
to
he
ca
say
what
to
me
he
said
and
yet
he
moves
her
they
aver
the
nightingales
sing
through
my
head
the
nightingales
the
nightingales
vi
he
says
to
her
what
moves
her
most
he
would
not
name
his
soul
within
her
hearing
rather
pays
her
cost
with
praises
to
her
lips
and
chin
man
has
but
one
soul
is
ordained
and
each
soul
but
one
love
i
add
yet
souls
are
damned
and
love
profaned
these
nightingales
will
sing
me
mad
the
nightingales
the
nightingales
vii
i
marvel
how
the
birds
can
sing
there
little
difference
in
their
view
betwixt
our
tuscan
trees
that
spring
as
vital
flames
into
the
blue
and
dull
round
blots
of
foliage
meant
like
saturated
sponges
here
to
suck
the
fogs
up
as
content
is
he
too
in
this
land
is
clear
and
still
they
sing
the
nightingales

my
native
florence
dear
forgone
i
see
across
the
alpine
ridge
how
the
last
of
saint
john
shot
rockets
from
carraia
bridge
the
luminous
city
tall
with
fire
trod
deep
down
in
that
river
of
ours
while
many
a
boat
with
lamp
and
choir
skimmed
birdlike
over
glittering
towers
i
will
not
hear
these
nightingales
ix
i
seem
to
float
seem
to
float
down
arno
stream
in
festive
guise
a
boat
strikes
flame
into
our
boat
and
up
that
lady
seems
to
rise
as
then
she
rose
the
shock
had
flashed
a
vision
on
us
what
a
head
what
leaping
eyeballs
beauty
dashed
to
splendour
by
a
sudden
dread
and
still
they
sing
the
nightingales
x
too
bold
to
sin
too
weak
to
die
such
women
are
so
as
for
me
i
would
we
had
drowned
there
he
and
i
that
moment
loving
perfectly
he
had
not
caught
her
with
her
loosed
gold
ringlets
rarer
in
the
south
nor
heard
the
grazie
tanto
bruised
to
sweetness
by
her
english
mouth
and
still
they
sing
the
nightingales
xi
she
had
not
reached
him
at
my
heart
with
her
fine
tongue
as
snakes
indeed
kill
flies
nor
had
i
for
my
part
yearned
after
in
my
desperate
need
and
followed
him
as
he
did
her
to
coasts
left
bitter
by
the
tide
whose
very
nightingales
elsewhere
delighting
torture
and
deride
for
still
they
sing
the
nightingales
xii
a
worthless
woman
mere
cold
clay
as
all
false
things
are
but
so
fair
she
takes
the
breath
of
men
away
who
gaze
upon
her
unaware
i
would
not
play
her
larcenous
tricks
to
have
her
looks
she
lied
and
stole
and
spat
into
my
love
pure
pyx
the
rank
saliva
of
her
soul
and
still
they
sing
the
nightingales
xiii
i
would
not
for
her
white
and
pink
though
such
he
likes
her
grace
of
limb
though
such
he
has
praised
nor
yet
i
think
for
life
itself

spent
with
him
commit
such
sacrilege
affront
god
nature
which
is
love
intrude
two
affianced
souls

hunt
like
spiders
in

can
not
bear
these
nightingales
xiv
if
she
chose
sin
some
gentler
guise
she
might
have
sinned
in
so
it
seems
she
might
have
pricked
out
both
my
eyes
and
i
still
seen
him
in
my
dreams
or
drugged
me
in
my
soup
or
wine
nor
left
me
angry
afterward
to
die
here
with
his
hand
in
mine
his
breath
upon
me

not
hard
our
lady
hush
these

set
a

only
good

christ
knows
well
what
sin
is
when
he
sees
some
things
done

must
move
himself

wonder
let
her
pass

think
of
her
by
night

must
too
join
her
out
alas
with
giulio

word

evermore

so

you
be
silent

i
speak

you
not
hear

arm

throw
round
someone

i
feel
so
weak

birds

sing
for
spite

sing
for
hate

sing
through
death

sing
through
night

sing

stun
me
in
the
tomb

nightingales

nightingales
my
kate

she
was
not
as
pretty
as
women
i
know

yet
all
your
best
made
of
sunshine

snow
drop
to
shade
melt
to
nought

ways
while
she
still
remembered
on
warm
and
cold
days
my
kate
ii
her
air
had
a
meaning
her
movements
a
grace
you
turned
from
the
fairest
to
gaze
on
her
face

when
you
had
once
seen
her
forehead
and
mouth
you
saw
as
distinctly
her
soul
and
her
truth
my
kate
iii
such
a
blue
inner
light
from
her
eyelids
outbroke
you
looked
at
her
silence
and
fancied
she
spoke
when
she
did
so
peculiar
yet
soft
was
the
tone
though
the
loudest
spoke
also
you
heard
her
alone
my
kate
iv
i
doubt
if
she
said
to
you
much
that
could
act
as
a
thought
or
suggestion
she
did
not
attract
in
the
sense
of
the
brilliant
or
wise
i
infer
was
her
thinking
of
others
made
you
think
of
her
my
kate
she
never
found
fault
with
you
never
implied
your
wrong
by
her
right
and
yet
men
at
her
side
grew
nobler
girls
purer

through
the
whole

children
were
gladder

pulled
at
her
gown

kate

none
knelt
at
her
feet

thrall

knelt
more
to
god
than
they
used
that
was
all
if
you
praised
her
as
charming
some
asked
what
you
meant

the
charm

her
presence
was
felt
when
she
went

weak

ribald

you

better
than
to

me
me

your

fair
amy
of
the

assist
me
to
discover
why
you
who
would
not

a
mouse
can
torture
so
your
lover
ii
you
give
your
coffee
to
the
cat
you
stroke
the
dog
for
coming
and
all
your
face
grows
kinder
at
the
little
brown
bee
humming
iii
but
when
haunts
your
door
the
town
marks
coming
and
marks
going
you
seem
to
have
stitched
your
eyelids
down
to
that
long
piece
of
sewing
iv
you
never
give
a
look
not
you
nor
drop
him
a
good
morning
to
keep
his
long
day
warm
and
blue
so
fretted
by
your
scorning
she
shook
her
head
the
mouse
and
bee
for
crumb
or
flower
will
linger
the
dog
is
happy
at
my
knee
the
cat
purrs
at
my
finger
vi
but
to
the
least
thing
given
means
great
things
at
a
distance
he
wants
my
world
my
sun
my
heaven
soul
body
whole
existence

they
say
love
gives
as
well
as
takes
but
i
a
simple
maiden
my
mother
first
smile
when
she
wakes
i
still
have
smiled
and
prayed
in
viii
i
only
know
my
mother
love
which
gives
all
and
asks
nothing
and
this
new
loving
sets
the
groove
too
much
the
way
of
loathing
ix
unless
he
gives
me
all
in
change
i
forfeit
all
things
by
him
the
risk
is
terrible
and
strange
i
tremble
doubt
deny
him

sweetest
friend

hardest
foe
best
angel
or
worst
devil
i
either
hate
or
love
him
so
i

be
merely
civil
xi
you
trust
a
woman
who
puts
forth
her
blossoms
thick
as
summer
you
think
she
dreams
what
love
is
worth
who
casts
it
to
xii
such
love
a
to
fling
a

pretty
pastime

all
me

dear
neighbour
of
the
trellised
house
a
man
should
murmur
never
though
treated
worse
than
dog
and
mouse
till
doated
on
for
ever
my
heart
and
i
enough
we
tired
my
heart
and
i
we
sit
beside
the
headstone
thus
and
wish
that
name
were
carved
for
us
the
moss
reprints
more
tenderly
the
hard
types
of
the
mason
knife
as
heaven
sweet
life
renews
earth
life
with
which
we
tired
my
heart
and
ii
you
see
we
tired
my
heart
and
i
we
dealt
with
books
we
trusted
men
and
in
our
own
blood
drenched
the
pen
as
if
such
colours
could
not
fly
we
walked
too
straight
for
fortune
end
we
loved
too
true
to
keep
a
friend
at
last
we
tired
my
heart
and
iii
how
tired
we
feel
my
heart
and
i
we
seem
of
no
use
in
the
world
our
fancies
hang
grey
and
uncurled
about
men
eyes
indifferently
our
voice
which
thrilled
you
so
will
let
you
sleep
our
tears
are
only
wet
what
do
we
here
my
heart
and
i
iv
so
tired
so
tired
my
heart
and
i
it
was
not
thus
in
that
old
time
when
ralph
sat
with
me
the
lime
to
watch
the
sunset
from
the
sky
dear
love
you
looking
tired
he
said
i
smiling
at
him
shook
my
head
is
now
we
tired
my
heart
and
so
tired
so
tired
my
heart
and
i
though
now
none
takes
me
on
his
arm
to
fold
me
close
and
kiss
me
warm
till
each
quick
breath
end
in
a
sigh
of
happy
languor
now
alone
we
lean
upon
this
graveyard
stone
uncheered
unkissed
my
heart
and
vi
tired
out
we
are
my
heart
and
i
suppose
the
world
brought
diadems
to
tempt
us
crusted
with
loose
gems
of
powers
and
pleasures
let
it
try
we
scarcely
care
to
look
at
even
a
pretty
child
or
god
blue
heaven
we
feel
so
tired
my
heart
and
vii
yet
who
complains
my
heart
and
i
in
this
abundant
earth
no
doubt
is
little
room
for
things
worn
out
disdain
them
break
them
throw
them
by
and
if
before
the
days
grew
rough
we
were
loved
used
well
enough
i
think
we
fared
my
heart
and
i
the
best
thing
in
the
world
what
the
best
thing
in
the
world
by
impearled
sweet
that
means
no
rain
truth
not
cruel
to
a
friend
pleasure
not
in
haste
to
end
beauty
not
and
curled
till
its
pride
is
light
that
never
makes
you
wink
memory
that
gives
no
pain
love
when
you
loved
again
what
the
best
thing
in
the
world
something
out
of
it
i
think
where
agnes
nay
if
i
had
come
back
so
and
found
her
dead
in
her
grave
and
if
a
friend
i
know
had
said
be
strong
nor
rave
she
lies
there
dead
below
ii
i
saw
her
i
who
speak
white
stiff
the
face
one
blank
the
blue
shade
came
to
her
cheek
before
they
nailed
the
plank
for
she
had
been
dead
a
week
iii
why
if
he
had
spoken
so
i
might
have
believed
the
thing
although
her
look
although
her
step
laugh
voice
ring
lived
in
me
still
as
they
do
iv
but
dead
that
other
way
corrupted
thus
and
lost
that
sort
of
worm
in
the
clay
i
can
not
count
the
cost
that
i
should
rise
and
pay
my
agnes
false
such
shame
she
rather
be
it
said
that
the
pure
saint
of
her
name
has
stood
there
in
her
stead
and
tricked
you
to
this
blame
vi
her
very
gown
her
cloak
fell
chastely
no
disguise
but
expression
while
she
broke
with
her
clear
grey
full
upon
me
and
then
spoke
vii
she
wore
her
hair
away
from
her
forehead
like
a
cloud
which
a
little
wind
in
may
peels
off
finely
disallowed
though
bright
enough
to
stay
viii
for
the
heavens
must
have
the
place
to
themselves
to
use
and
shine
in
as
her
soul
would
have
her
face
to
press
through
upon
mine
in
that
orb
of
angel
grace
ix
had
she
any
fault
at
all
was
having
none
i
thought
too
there
seemed
a
sort
of
thrall
as
she
felt
her
shadow
ought
to
fall
straight
upon
the
wall
x
her
sweetness
strained
the
sense
of
common
life
and
duty
and
every
day
expense
of
moving
in
such
beauty
required
almost
defence
xi
what
good
i
thought
is
done
by
such
sweet
things
if
any
this
world
smells
ill
i
the
sun
though
the
are
many
is
only
one
xii
can
a
voice
so
low
and
soft
take
open
actual
part
with
right
maintain
aloft
pure
truth
in
life
or
art
vexed
always
wounded
oft
xiii
fit
with
that
fair
pose
which
melts
from
curve
to
curve
to
stand
run
work
with
those
who
wrestle
and
deserve
and
speak
plain
without
glose
xiv
but
i
turned
round
on
my
fear
defiant
disagreeing
what
if
god
has
set
her
here
less
for
action
than
for
being
for
the
eye
and
for
the
ear
xv
just
to
show
what
beauty
may
just
to
prove
what
music
can
and
then
to
die
away
from
the
presence
of
a
man
who
shall
learn
henceforth
to
pray
xvi
as
a
door
left
half
ajar
in
heaven
would
make
him
think
how
are
things
glanced
at
through
the
chink
till
he
pined
from
near
to
far
xvii
that
door
could
lead
to
hell
that
shining
merely
meant
damnation
what
she
fell
like
a
woman
who
was
sent
like
an
angel
by
a
spell
xviii
she
who
scarcely
trod
the
earth
turned
mere
dirt
my
agnes
mine
called
so
felt
of
too
much
worth
to
be
used
so
too
divine
to
be
breathed
near
and
so
forth
xix
why
i
dared
not
name
a
sin
in
her
presence
i
went
round
clipped
its
name
and
shut
it
in
some
mysterious
crystal
sound
changed
the
dagger
for
the
pin
xx
now
you
name
herself
o
my
agnes
o
my
saint
then
the
great
joys
of
the
lord
do
not
last
then
all
this
paint
runs
off
nature
leaves
a
board
xxi
who
dead
here
no
not
she
rather
i
or
whence
this
damp
cold
corruption
misery
while
my
very
mourners
stamp
closer
in
the
clods
on
me
xxii
and
my
mouth
is
full
of
dust
till
i
can
not
speak
and
curse
speak
and
damn
him
blame
unjust
sin
blots
out
the
universe
all
because
she
would
and
must
xxiii
she
my
white
rose
dropping
off
the
high
branch
and
not
that
the
blew
too
rough
or
the
burnt
too
hot
but
that
being
a
rose
was
enough
