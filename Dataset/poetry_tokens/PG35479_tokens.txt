a
poem
for
the
times
by
john
thompson
who
talks
of
coercion
who
dares
to
deny
a
resolute
people
their
right
to
be
free
let
him
blot
out
forever
one
star
from
the
sky
or
curb
with
his
fetter
one
wave
of
the
sea
who
prates
of
coercion
can
love
be
restored
to
bosoms
where
only
resentment
may
dwell
can
peace
upon
earth
be
proclaimed
by
the
sword
or
among
men
be
established
by
shell
shame
shame
that
the
statesman
and
trickster
forsooth
should
have
for
a
crisis
no
other
recourse
beneath
the
fair
of
light
and
of
truth
than
the
old
of
tyranny
force
from
the
holes
where
fraud
falsehood
and
hate
slink
away
from
the
crypt
in
which
error
lies
buried
in
chains
this
foul
apparition
stalks
forth
to
the
day
and
would
ravage
the
land
which
his
presence
profanes
could
you
conquer
us
men
of
the
north
could
you
bring
desolation
and
death
on
our
homes
as
a
flood
can
you
hope
the
pure
lily
affection
will
spring
from
ashes
all
reeking
and
sodden
with
blood
could
you
brand
us
as
villeins
and
serfs
know
ye
not
what
fierce
sullen
hatred
lurks
under
the
scar
how
loyal
to
hapsburg
is
venice
i
wot
how
dearly
the
pole
loves
his
father
the
czar
but
well
to
remember
this
land
of
the
sun
is
a
and
suckles
a
race
and
banded
as
one
who
brook
not
oppression
and
know
not
disgrace
and
well
may
the
schemers
in
office
beware
the
swift
retribution
that
waits
upon
crime
when
the
lion
resistance
shall
leap
from
his
lair
with
a
fury
that
renders
his
vengeance
sublime
once
men
of
the
north
we
were
brothers
and
still
though
brothers
no
more
we
would
gladly
be
friends
nor
join
in
a
conflict
accurst
that
must
fill
with
ruin
the
country
on
which
it
descends
but
if
smitten
with
blindness
and
mad
with
the
rage
the
gods
give
to
all
whom
they
wished
to
destroy
you
would
act
a
new
iliad
to
darken
the
age
with
horrors
beyond
what
is
told
us
of
troy
if
deaf
as
the
adder
itself
to
the
cries
when
wisdom
humanity
justice
implore
you
would
have
our
proud
eagle
to
feed
on
the
eyes
of
those
who
have
taught
him
so
grandly
to
soar
if
there
be
to
your
malice
no
limit
imposed
and
your
reckless
design
is
to
rule
with
the
rod
the
men
upon
whom
you
have
already
closed
our
goodly
domain
and
the
temples
of
god
to
the
breeze
then
your
banner
dishonored
unfold
and
at
once
let
the
tocsin
be
sounded
afar
we
greet
you
as
greeted
the
swiss
charles
the
bold
with
a
farewell
to
peace
and
a
welcome
to
war
for
the
courage
that
clings
to
our
soil
ever
bright
shall
catch
inspiration
from
turf
and
from
tide
our
sons
unappalled
shall
go
forth
to
the
fight
with
the
smile
of
the
fair
the
pure
kiss
of
the
bride
and
the
bugle
its
echoes
shall
send
through
the
past
in
the
trenches
of
yorktown
to
waken
the
slain
while
the
sods
of
king
mountain
shall
heave
at
the
blast

give

to

of
old
who
long
since
in
the
limits
of

north
set
up
his
evil
throne
and
warred
with
god
what
if
both
mad
and
blinded
in
their
rage
our
foes
should
fling
us
down
their
mortal
gage
and
with
a
hostile
step
profane

sod

shall
not
shrink
my

go
forth

them
marshaled
by
the
lord
of

overshadowed
by
the
mighty
ghosts
of
moultrie

of

shall
foil

such
as
these

these

every
stock

help
us

the
very
soil
and
all
the
generous
wealth
it
gives
to
toil
and
all
for
which
we
love
our
noble

our

the
hour

not
yet
ripe
when
all
shall
see
it
but
behold
the
type
of
what
we
are
and
shall
be
to
the
world
in
our
own
grand
and
genial
gulf
stream
furled
which
through
the
vast
and
colder
ocean
pours
its
waters
so
that
arctic
shores
may
sometimes
catch
upon

softened
breeze
strange
tropic
warmth

hints
of

star
spangled
oh
say
can
you
see
through
the
gloom
and
the
storm
more
bright
for
the
darkness
that
pure
constellation
like
the
symbol
of
love
and
redemption
its
form
as
it
points
to
the
haven
of
hope
for
the
nation
how
radiant
each
star
as
the
beacon
afar
giving
promise
of
peace
or
assurance
in
war
is
the
cross
of
the
south
which
shall
ever
remain
to
light
us
to
freedom
and
glory
again
how
peaceful
and
blest
was
america
soil
till
betrayed
by
the
guile
of
the
puritan
demon
which
lurks
under
virtue
and
springs
from
its
coil
to
fasten
its
fangs
in
the
of
freemen
then
loudly
appeal
to
each
heart
that
can
feel
and
crush
the
foul
viper
liberty
heel
and
the
cross
of
the
south
shall
forever
remain
to

us
to
freedom
and
glory
again
is
the
emblem
of
peace
is
the
of
hope
like
the
sacred
labarum
which
guided
the
roman
from
the
shores
of
the
gulf
to
the
delaware
slope
is
the
trust
of
the
free
and
the
terror
of
foemen
fling
its
folds
to
the
air
while
we
boldly
declare
the
rights
we
demand
or
the
deeds
that
we
dare
and
the
cross
of
the
south
shall
forever
remain
to
light
us
to
freedom
and
glory
again
but
if
peace
should
be
hopeless
and
justice
denied
and
war
bloody
vulture
should
flap
his
black
pinions
then
gladly
to
arms
while
we
hurl
in
our
pride
defiance
to
tyrants
and
death
to
their
minions
with
our
front
to
the
field
swearing
never
to
yield
or
return
like
the
spartan
in
death
on
our
shield
and
the
cross
of
the
south
shall
triumphantly
wave

farewell
to
brother
jonathan
by
caroline
farewell
we
must
part
we
have
turned
from
the
land
of
our
brother
with
tyrannous
hand
who
assumed
all
our
rights
as
a
favor
to
grant
and
whose
smile
ever
covered
the
sting
of
a
taunt
who
breathed
on
the
fame
he
was
bound
to
defend
still
the
craftiest
foe
the
guise
of
a
friend
who
believed
that
our
bosoms
would
bleed
at
a
touch
yet
could
never
believe
he
could
goad
them
too
much
whose
conscience
affects
to
be
seared
with
our
sin
yet
is
plastic
to
take
all
its
benefits
in
the
mote
in
our
eye
so
enormous
has
grown
that
he
never
perceives
there
a
beam
in
his
own
o
jonathan
jonathan
vassal
of
pelf
yes
every
inch
self
your
loyalty
now
is
all
bluster
and
boast
but
was
dumb
when
the
foemen
invaded
our
coast
in
vain
did
your
country
appeal
to
you
then
you
coldly
refused
her
your
money
and
men
your
trade
interrupted
you
slunk
from
her
wars
and
preferred
british
gold
to
the
stripes
and
the
stars
then
our
generous
blood
was
as
water
poured
forth
and
the
sons
of
the
south
were
the
shields
of
the
north
nor
our
patriot
ardor
one
moment
gave
till
the
foe
you
had
fed
we
had
driven
from
the
shore
long
years
we
have
suffered
opprobrium
and
wrong
but
we
clung
to
your
side
with
affection
so
strong
that
at
last
in
mere
wanton
aggression
you
broke
all
the
ties
of
our
hearts
with
one
murderous
stroke
we
are
tired
of
contest
for
what
is
our
own
we
are
sick
of
a
strife
that
could
never
be
done
thus
our
love
has
died
out
and
its
altars
are
dark
not
prometheus
self
could
rekindle
the
spark
o
jonathan
jonathan
deadly
the
sin
of
your
tigerish
thirst
for
the
blood
of
your
kin
and
shameful
the
spirit
that
gloats
over
wives
and
maidens
despoiled
of
their
honor
and
lives
your
palaces
rise
from
the
fruits
of
our
toil
your
millions
are
fed
from
the
wealth
of
our
soil
the
balm
of
our
air
brings
the
health
to
your
cheek
and
our
hearts
are
aglow
with
the
welcome
we
speak
o
brother
beware
how
you
seek
us
again
lest
you
brand
on
your
forehead
the
signet
of
cain
that
blood
and
that
crime
on
your
conscience
must
sit
we
may
fall
we
may
perish
but
never
submit
the
pathway
that
leads
to
the
pharisee
door
we
remember
indeed
but
we
tread
it
no
more

the
right
above
the
wrong
by
john
w
overall
in
other
days
our
fathers
love
was
loyal
full
and
free
for
those
they
left
behind
them
in
the
island
of
the
sea
they
fought
the
battles
of
king
george
and
toasted
him
in
song
for
them
the
right
kept
proudly
down
the
tyranny
of
wrong
but
when
the
king
weak
willing
slaves
laid
tax
upon
the
tea
the
western
men
rose
up
and
braved
the
island
of
the
sea
and
swore
a
fearful
oath
to
god
those
men
of
iron
might
that
in
the
end
the
wrong
should
die
and
up
should
go
the
right
the
king
sent
over
hireling
hosts
briton
hessian
scot
and
swore
in
turn
those
western
men
when
captured
should
be
shot
while
chatham
spoke
with
earnest
tongue
against
the
hireling
throng
and
mournfully
saw
the
right
go
down
and
place
give
to
the
wrong
but
god
was
on
the
righteous
side
and
gideon
sword
was
out
with
clash
of
steel
and
rattling
drum
and
freeman
and
crimson
torrents
drenched
the
land
through
that
long
stormy
fight
but
in
the
end
hurrah
the
wrong
was
beaten
by
the
right
and
when
again
the
foemen
came
from
out
the
northern
sea
to
desolate
our
smiling
land
and
subjugate
the
free
our
fathers
rushed
to
drive
them
back
with
rifles
keen
and
long
and
swore
a
mighty
oath
the
right
should
subjugate
the
wrong
and
while
the
world
was
looking
on
the
strife
uncertain
grew
but
soon
aloft
rose
up
our
stars
amid
a
field
of
blue
for
jackson
fought
on
red
chalmette
and
won
the
glorious
fight
and
then
the
wrong
went
down
hurrah
and
triumph
crowned
the
right
the
day
has
come
again
when
men
who
love
the
beauteous

by

accursed
of
god

sanctimonious
fool

we
muster
on
each
bloody
plain
thick
as
the

through

time
the
bells
to
the
tories
of
virginia
i
speak
this
unto
your
shame
in
the
ages
gone
by
when
virginia
arose
her
honor
and
truth
to
maintain
her
sons
round
her
banner
would
rally
with
pride
determined
to
save
it
from
stain
no
heart
in
those
days
was
so
false
or
so
cold
that
it
did
not
exquisitely
thrill
with
a
love
and
devotion
that
none
would
withhold
until
death
the
proud
bosom
should
chill
was
virginia
in
danger
fast
fast
at
her
call
from
the
mountains
unto
the
sea
came
up
her
brave
children
their
mother
to
shield
and
to
die
that
she
still
might
be
free
and
a
coward
was
he
who
when
danger
dark
cloud
overshadowed
virginia
fair
sky
turned
a
deaf
careless
ear
when
her
summons
was
heard
or
refused
for
her
honor
to
die
oh
proud
are
the
of
days
that
are
past
and
richly
the
heart
thrills
we
think
of
the
brave
who
their
mother
to
save
have
died
as
they
lived
without
fear
but
can
it
be
that
virginia
name
fails
to
waken
the
homage
and
love
of
one
of
her
sons
oh
cold
cold
must
be
the
heart
that
her
name
will
not
move
when
she
rallies
for
freedom
for
justice
and
right
will
her
sons
with
a
withering
sneer
revile
her
and
taunt
her
with
treason
and
shame
or
say
she
is
moved
by
foul
fear
will
they
tell
her
her
glories
have
fled
or
grown
pale
that
she
bends
to
a
tyrant
in
shame
will
they
trample
her
glorious
flag
in
the
dust
or
load
with
reproaches
her
name
will
they
fly
from
her
shores
or
desert
her
in
need
will
their
backs
ever
turn
on
their
mother
and
fly
when
the
danger
is
nigh
and
her
claim
to
their
fealty
spurn
false
false
is
the
heart
that
refuses
to
yield
the
love
that
virginia
doth
claim
and
base
is
the
tongue
that
could
utter
the
lie
that
charges
his
mother
with
shame
a
blot
on
her
a
stain
on
her
name
our
heart
blood
should
wipe
it
away
we
should
die
for
her
honor
and
count
it
a
boon
her
mandates
to
heed
and
obey
but
never
oh
never
let
human
tongue
say
she
is
false
to
her
honor
or
fame
she
is
true
to
her
past
to
her
future
she
true
and
virginia
has
never
known
shame
then
shame
on
the
dastard
the
recreant
fool
that
the
at
her
now
that
would
coldly
refuse
her
fair
fame
to
uphold
that
would
basely
prove
false
to
his
vow
but
no
it
can
not
it
can
never
be
true
that
virginia
claims
one
single
child
that
would
ever
prove
false
to
his
home
or
his
god
or
be
with
foul
treason
defiled
and
the
man
that
could
succor
her
enemies
even
though
on
her
soil
he
were
born
is
so
base
so
inhuman
so
false
and
so
vile
that
virginia
disowns
him
with
scorn
war
song
by
a
meek
of
mobile
wouldst
thou
have
me
love
thee
dearest
with
a

ever
hold
thee

calling
on
her

leave
these

of

like

do
seize
thy

which
once
flashed
as

till

the
stormy

listen
now
thy

in

thee
doom
thee
to

grave

canonized

thy

sumter
a
ballad
of
by

was
on
the
twelfth
of
april
before
the
break
of
day
we
heard
the
guns
of
moultrie
give
signal
for
the
fray
anon
across
the
waters
there
boomed
the
answering
gun
from
north
and
south
came
flash
on
flash
the
battle
had
begun
the
mortars
belched
their
deadly
food
and
spiteful
whizzed
the
balls
a
fearful
storm
of
iron
hailed
on
sumter
doomèd
walls
we
watched
the
meteor
flight
of
shell
and
saw
the
lightning
flash
saw
where
each
fiery
missile
fell
and
heard
the
sullen
crash
the
morn
was
dark
and
cloudy
yet
till
the
sun
arose
no
answer
to
our
gallant
boys
came
booming
from
our
foes
then
through
the
dark
and
murky
clouds
the
morning
sunlight
came
and
forth
from
sumter
frowning
walls
burst
sudden
sheets
of
flame
the
shot
and
shell
flew
thick
and
fast
the
howling
spoke
and
thundering
came
their
angry
roar
through
wreathing
clouds
of
smoke
again
to
fight
for
liberty
our
gallant
sons
had
come
they
smiled
when
came
the
bugle
call
and
laughed
when
tapped
the
drum
from

from

came
our
gallant

the

still
i

ah
will
this

end
oh
let

at

hears
no
creaking

what
the
village
bell
said
by
john
of
full
many
a
year
in
the
village
church
above
the
world
have
i
made
my
home
and
happier
there
than
if
i
had
hung
high
up
in
air
in
a
golden
dome
for
i
have
tolled
when
the
slow
hearse
rolled
its
burden
sad
to
my
door
and
each
echo
that
woke
with
the
solemn
stroke
was
a
sigh
from
the
heart
of
the
poor
i
know
the
great
bell
of
the
city
spire
is
a
far
prouder
one
than
such
as
i
and
its
deafening
stroke
compared
with
mine
is
thunder
compared
with
a
sigh
but
the
shattering
note
of
his
brazen
throat
as
it
swells
on
the
sabbath
air
far
oftener
rings
for
other
things
than
a
call
to
the
house
of
prayer
brave
boy
i
tolled
when
your
father
died
and
you
wept
when
my
tones
pealed
loud
and
more
gently
i
rung
when
the
dame
your
mother
dear
lay
in
her
shroud
and
i
rang
in
sweet
tone
the
angels
might
own
when
your
sister
you
gave
to
your
friend
oh
i
rang
with
delight
on
that
sweet
summer
night
when
they
vowed
they
would
love
to
the
end
but
a
base
foe
comes
from
the
regions
of
crime
with
a
heart
all
hot
with
the
flames
of
hell
and
the
tones
of
the
bell
you
have
loved
so
long
no
more
on
the
air
shall
swell
for
the
people
chief
with
his
proud
belief
that
his
country
cause
is
god
own
would
change
the
song
the
hills
have
rung
to
the
thunder
harsher
tone
then
take
me
down
from
the
village
church
where
in
peace
so
long
i
have
hung
but
i
charge
you
by
all
the
loved
and
lost
the
songs
i
have
remember
the
mound
of
holy
ground
where
your
father
and
mother
lie
and
swear
by
the
love
for
the
dead
above
to
beat
your
foul
foe
or
die
then
take
me
but
when
i
charge
you
this
you
have
come
to
the
bloody
field
that
the
bell
of
god
to
a
cannon
grown
you
will
to
the
foeman
yield
by
the
love
of
the
past
be
that
hour
your
last
when
the
foe
has
reached
this
trust
and
make
him
a
bed
of
patriot
dead
and
let
him
sleep
in
this
holy
dust
we
come
we
come
by

we
come
we
come
for
death

life
for
the
grave
or
victory
we
come
to
the
broad
red
sea
of
strife
where
the
black
flag
waveth
free
we
come
as
men
to
do
or
die
nor
feel
that
the
lot
is
hard
when
hero
calls
and
our
is
on
to
beauregard
up
craven
up
is
no
time
for
ease
when
the
crimson
rolls
to
our
very
doors
up
up
for
these
are
times
to
try
men
souls
the
purple
gore
calls
from
the
sod
of
our
martyred
brothers
graves
and
raises
a
red
right
hand
to
god
to
guard
our
avenging
braves
and
unto
the
last
bright
drop
that
thrills
the
depths
of
the
southern
heart
we
must
battle
for
our
sunny
hills
for
the
freedom
of
our
mart
for
all
that
honor
claims

right
for
country

path
through

serried
ranks
be
the
fierce
tornado
track
that
bursts
from
the
torrid
fervid
banks
and
scatters
destruction
black
for
the
hot
life
leaping
in
the
veins
of
our
young
confederacy

lay
holding
the
ruthless
foe
at
bay
through
chilly
night
and
burning
day
our
army
at
manassas
to
them
our
eager
eyes
were
turned
while
many
a
restless
spirit
burned
and
many
a
fond
heart
wildly
yearned
loved
ones
at
manassas
for
fast
the
vandals
gathered
strong
in
wealth
and
numbers
all
along
our
highways
pressed
a
countless
throng
to
battle
at
manassas
with
martial
pomp
and
proud
array
with
burnished
arms
and
banners
gay
panting
for
the
inhuman
fray
they
rolled
upon
manassas
the
opening
cannons
thunders
rent
the
air
and
ere
their
charge
was
spent
muskets
and
rifles
quickly
sent
death
to
us
at
manassas
but
like
a
wall
of
granite
stood
the
true
the
great
the
brave
the
good
who
firmly
holding
field
and
wood
guarded
us
at
manassas
they
promptly
answered
fire
with
fire
danger
could
not
with
fear
inspire
their
hearts
whose
courage
rose
the
higher
when
death
ruled
at
manassas
at
dawn
the
murderous
work
begun
the
battle
fiercely
raged
at
noon
evening
drew
on
was
not
done
the
carnage
at
manassas
oh
trembling
freedom
didst
thou
stay
throughout
that
agonizing
day
to
watch
where
victory
would
lay
her
laurels
at
manassas
yea
and
thy
potent
trumpet
tone
ordered
our
gallant
warriors
on
to
the
bold
charge
which
for
thee
won
the
triumph
at
manassas
well
might
the
dastard
foemen
yield
when
right
and
vengeance
joined
to
wield
the
ball
and
glittering
steel
which
hurled
them
from
manassas
they
broke
and
fear
lent
wings
to
feet
flying
before
our

rises
from

all
around
a
hundred
thousand
men
gather
in
from

they

the
foemen
of

coming
forth
in
the
pride

they
would
trample
down

right
as
forth
they
come
those
foemen
of
the
north
the
flag
which
they
bear
is
a
snare
its
stripes
writhe
as
snakes
upon
the
air
and
its
stars
no

bright
tell
of
chaos
and
of
night
and
of
how
they

will
set
in

on

the
lengthening
line
as
if
eager
for
the
wine
which
from
the
press
of
battle
freely
flows
and
from
the
southern
heart
such
wine
will
freely
start
as
the
pledge
to
each
hecatomb
of
foes
on
comes
the
lengthened
line
and
a
higher
law
the
snakes
on
their
banners
seem
to
hiss
destruction
to
the
south
bursts
in
hate
from
every
mouth
and
the
are
held
akin
to
bliss
a
brave
heroic
band

to
hand
to
meet
the
shock
of

are
prepared
for

they
stand
for

and
native
land
oh
pray
that
every
hero
may
be
spared
the
drum
and
fife
may
sound
but
their
stirring
notes
are
drowned
in
the
roar
and
the
thunder
of
the
guns
the
bullets
fly
and
the
shells
ascend
the
sky
they
are
offerings
to
god
and
freedom
sons
where
freedom
nerves
the
arm
there
a
charm
where
freedom
stirs
the
heart
fears
depart
oh
sacred
is
the
strife
and
the
sacrifice
of
life
where
freedom
chosen
heroes
point
the
dart
god
how
the
freemen
press
there
distress
in
each
lead
and
iron
shower
that
they
send
their
countless
columns
pour
like
the
waves
in
wild
uproar
beating
on
a
rocky
shore
they
would
rend
but
firm
as
rocks
our

grandly
stand
for

hand
to

how
the
proud
invaders
reel
as
with

destruction
wide
we
deal
sternly
grand
again
and

again
these
wild
fanatic
men
those

the
cry
we

conquer
here
or
die
the
laurel
or
the
fate
of
hellish
gnomes
again
and
yet
again
southern

force
the
fierce
insulting
foe
to
retire
again
the

the
daring

how
fearfully
they
bleed
man
and

oh
how
their
dying
prayer
rends
the
air
all
this
for
northern
greed
all
that
strange
fanatic
creed
which
so
wickedly
they
heed
not
spare
the
southron
is
accurst
so
they
say
he
baser
than
the
worst
beast
of
prey
and
the
african
is
white
in
those
northern
foemen
sight
as
the
lily
when
it
greets
the
god
of

then
drive
them
to
their
lair
do
not
spare
let
shot
and
shell
reply
to
their
cry
though
their
bodies
taint
the
air
and
become
the
vulture
fare
it
is
just
that
such
invading
hordes
should
die
mcdowell
in
the
van
sees
his
beaten
columns
fly
he
calls
on
god
and

for
the
aid
that
both
deny
the

he

rally

thus
thus
mcdowell

ye
not
ye
unworthy
knaves
that
you
fight
the
fight
for

sable

come
and
purchase
redder
graves
with
your
guns
but
the
guns
are
thrown
away
the
invaders
will
not
stay
to
them
a
fearful
lesson
has
been
read
for
miles
strewn
all
around
encrimsoning
the
rich
ground
lie
their
fallen
friends
the
wounded
and
the
dead
the
sun
slopes
down
the
west
but
the
foe
in
wild
unrest
rushes
on
though
destruction
follows
fast
the
southern
cavalcade
dyes
with
red
each
trusty
blade
and
the
carnage
is
terrible
and
vast
oh
where
is
scott
the
chief
why
brings
he
not
relief
and
patterson
the
tardy
where
is
he
and
where
is
abe
the
great
with
his
cap
and
cloak
of
state
he
should
see
how
his
warriors
can
flee
fear
lendeth
speed
to
flight
and
the
foe
invokes
the
night
to
let
its
starless
curtain
quickly
fall
but
it
falleth
all
too
slow
for
the
terrors
of
the
foe
and
it
seems
to
them
the
shadow
of
a
pall
a
nemesis
concealed
in
the
shades
of
wold
and
field
breathes
of
vengeance
to
the
foemen
as
they
run
they
are
rushing
in
despair
but
there
carnage
everywhere
and
they
know
not
what
to
welcome
or
to
shun
ten
thousand
of
their
slain
strew
the
plain
the
shrieks
from
ten
thousand
more
arise
and
the
ghosts
from
their
hosts
wail
despairingly
and
vain
in
their
pain
for
a
welcome
to
the
skies
at
morning
in
their
pride
side
by
side
they
went
forth
in
their
might
to
the
fight
and
now
they
flee
in
fear
trembling
like
the
stricken
deer
at
the
saber
and
the
spear
it
is
night
they
came
forth
to
destroy
with
a
fierce
fanatic
joy
and
boasted
of
the
rebels
they
would
slay
but
ere
the
set
of
sun
there
are
hundreds
chased
by
one
and
they
pray
their
legs
to
bear
them
safe
away
for
miles
strewn
all
around
the
ground
the
records
of
their
flight
meet
the
sight
bodies
the
horses
tread
bodies
living
bodies
dead
and
the
swords
and
guns
most
beautifully
bright
but
let
us
leave
the

in
their
woe
to
the
god
of
peace

go

now
bring

out
my

my

we

sixteen
used

we
kept

bright
our

quick
and
true
as
far
if
not
as

we
drew

something

we
seen

we
never

to

on

bessie
bless
your

those
days
are
mostly
done
and
now
we

why
there
only
this
to

select
the

in

let
the

through

if
he
does
like
the
way
that

presents
the

he
maybe
change
his

and
stay
where
the
good
doodles
do
where
lincoln
lives
the
man
you
know
who
kissed
the

to
keep
the

no
keep

we

old

and
take
him
half
and
half
we
aim
to
him
if
a
fool
and
him
if
a
calf
we
teach
these
boys
the
tricks
by
which
a
war
is
won
especially
how
took
tories
on
the

only
one
killed
by

only
one
killed
in

b
was
a
trifling
loss
one
man
a
charge
of
the
bold
and
dashing
lee
while
merry
enough
it
was
to
see
the
enemy
as
he
ran
only
one
killed
upon
our
side
once
more
to
the
field
they
turn
quietly
now
the
horsemen
ride
and
pause
by
the
form
of
the
one
who
died
so
bravely
as
now
we
learn
their
grief
for
the
comrade
loved
and
true
for
a
time
was
unconcealed
they
saw
the
bullet
had
pierced
him
through
that
his
pain
was
brief
ah
very
few
die
thus
on
the
the
news
has
gone
to
his
home
afar
of
the
short
and
gallant
fight
of
the
noble
deeds
of
the
young
la
var
whose
life
went
out
as
a
falling
star
in
the
skirmish
of
the
night
only
one
killed
it
was
my
son
the
widowed
mother
cried
she
turned
but
to
clasp
the
sinking
one
who
heard
not
the
words
of
the
victory
won
but
of
him
who
had
bravely
died
ah
death
to
her
were
a
sweet
relief
the
bride
of
a
single
year
oh
would
she
might
with
her
weight
of
grief
lie
down
in
the
dust
with
the
autumn
leaf
now
trodden
and
brown
and
sere
but
no
she
must
bear
through
coming
life
her
burden
of
silent
woe
the
aged
mother
and
youthful
wife
must
live
through
a
nation
bloody
strife
sighing
and
waiting
to
go
where
the

swept
him
on
where

are
turning
the

upon

with
more
than

worst

have
uncovered
the

of
the
savage
that
slept
in

the

that
bound
him
they
have
rent
with

away

maddened
him
with

madness
to
be
almost
as
brutal
as
they
with
halter
and

and

to
the

up

there

be

cometh
press
home

when
at

you
can
not
like
the

go
strike
at
his

through

go
hunt
him
creep
up
to
his

ten

blacken
where

died
in
his

he
strikes
with

richmond

draw
back

be
divided

your
scorn

your
malice

your
taunting
that
have
for

bear
oppression
so
outrageous

you

wrath
if
hearts
so
cold

shall
meet
us

no

ask
you
now
henceforth
to
know
we
are
a

be
assured
we
fully
show
we
scorn
your
proclamation
we
were
not

to
break
the
peace
that
blessed
our

we
loved
the
quiet
calm
and

too
well
to
raise
a
hand
till
fierce
oppression
stronger
grew
and
bitter
were
your
sneers
then
to
our

we
must
be
true

show
a
coward

banner
while
it
waved
an
emblem
of

the
fiercest

we
had
braved

when
it
proved
that
stripes
alone
were
for
our
sunny
south
and
all
the
stars
in
triumph
shone
above
the
chilly
north
then
not

then
our
voices
rose
in
one
tumultuous
wave
we
will
the
tyranny
oppose

find
a
bloody
grave
another

shall
lead
our

to

the

no

privation
to
free
the
land
we
hold

dear
from
tyrannous

her

a
ballad
of
the
war
by
george
herbert
sass
of
watchman
what
of
the
night
through
the
city
darkening
street
silent
and
slow
the
guardsmen
go
on
their
long
and
lonely
beat
darkly
drearily
down
falleth
the
wintry
rain
and
the
cold
gray
mist
hath
the
kissed
as
it
glides
town
and
plain
beating
against
the
windows
the
sleet
falls
heavy
and
chill
and
the
children
draw
nigher
hearth
and
fire
as
the
blast
shrieks
loud
and
shrill
silent
is
all
without
save
the
sentry
challenge
grim
and
a
hush
sinks
down
the
weary
town
and
the
sleeper
eyes
are
dim
watchman
what
of
the
night
hark
from
the
old
church
tower
rings
loud
and
clear
on
the
wintry
air
the
chime
of
the
midnight
hour
but
another
sound
breaks
in
a
summons
deep
and
rude
the
roll
of
the
drum
and
the
rush
and
hum
of
a
gathering
multitude
and
the
dim
and
flickering
torch
sheds
a
red
and
lurid
glare
the
long
dark
line
where
bayonets
shine
faintly
yet
sternly
there
a
low
deep
voice
is
heard
rest
on
your
arms
my
men
then
the
muskets
clank
through
each
serried
rank
and
all
is
still
again
pale
faces
and
tearful
eyes
gaze
down
on
that
grim
array
for
a
rumor
hath
spread
that
that
column
dread
marcheth
ere
break
of
day
marcheth
against
the
rebels
whose
camp
lies
heavy
and
still
where
the
driving
sleet
and
the
cold
rain
beat
on
the
brow
of
a
distant
hill
and
the
mother
heart
grows
faint
as
she
thinks
of
her
darling
one
who
perchance
may
lie
that
wintry
sky
ere
the
long
dark
night
be
done
pallid
and
haggard
too
is
the
cheek
of
the
fair
young
wife
and
her
eye
grows
dim
as
she
thinks
of
him
she
loveth
more
than
life
for
fathers
husbands
sons
are
the
rebels
the
foe
would
smite
and
earnest
the
prayer
for
those
lives
so
dear
and
a
bleeding
country
right
and
where
their
treasure
is
there
is
each
loving
heart
and
sadly
they
gaze
by
the
torch
blaze
and
the
tears
unbidden
start
is
there
none
to
warn
the
camp
none
from
that
anxious
throng
ah
the
rain
beats
down
plain
and
town
the
way
is
dark
and
long
no
is
left
behind
none
that
is
brave
and
true
and
the
bayonets
bright
in
the
lurid
light
with
menace
stern
shine
through
guarded
is
every
street
brutal
the
hireling
foe
is
there
one
heart
here
will
boldly
dare
so
brave
a
deed
to
do
look
in
her
still
dark
room
alone
a
woman
kneels
with
care
deep
trace
on
her
pale
worn
face
and
sorrow
ruthless
seals
wrinkling
her
placid
brow
a
matron
she
and
fair
though
wan
her
cheek
and
the
silver
streak
gemming
her
glossy
hair
a
moment
in
silent
prayer
her
pale
lips
move
and
then
through
the
dreary
night
like
an
angel
bright
on
her
mission
of
love
to
men
she
glideth
upon
her
way
through
the
lonely
misty
street
shrinking
with
dread
as
she
hears
the
tread
of
the
watchman
on
his
beat
onward
ay
onward
still
far
past
the
weary
town
till
languor
doth
seize
on
her
feeble
knees
and
the
heavy
hands
hang
down
but
bravely
she
struggles
on
breasting
the
cold
dank
rain
and
heavy
and
chill
the
mist
from
the
hill
sweeps
down
upon
the
plain
hark
far
behind
she
hears
a
dull
and
muffled
tramp
but
before
her
the
gleam
of
the
beam
shines
out
from
the
southern
camp
she
hears
the
sentry
challenge
her
work
of
love
is
done
she
has
fought
a
good
fight
and
on
fame
proud
height
hath
a
crown
of
glory
won
oh
they
tell
of
a
tyrol
maiden
who
saved
from
a

with

early
blush
of
the

they
knew
that
a
great
deed
remained
to
be
done
when
they
passed
the

they
rose
with
the
sun
and
caught
life
from
his
light
those
giants
of
courage
those
anaks
in
fight
and
they
laughed
out
aloud
in
the
joy
of
their
might
marching
swift
for
the
river
on
on
like
the
rushing
of
storms
through
the
hills
on
on
with
a
tramp
that
is
firm
as
their
wills
and
the
one
heart
of
thousands
grows
buoyant
and
thrills
at
the
thought
of
the
river
on
the
sheen
of
their
swords
the
fierce
gleam
of
their
eyes
it
seemed
as
on
earth
a
new
sunlight
would
rise
and
flash
up
to
the
sun
in
the
skies
the
path
to
the
river
but
their
banners
and
all
darkened
with
gore
on
a
strong
wind
of
morning
streamed
wildly
before
like
the
wings
of
swept
fast
to
the
shore
the
green
shore
of
the
river
as
they
march
from
the
the
hamlet
the
stream
gaunt
throngs
whom
the
foeman
had
manacled
teem
like
men
just
roused
from
some
terrible
dream
to
pass
the
river
they
behold
the
broad
banners
yet
fair
and
a
moment
dissolves
the
last
spell
of
despair
while
a
peal
as
of
victory
swells
on
the
air
rolling
out
to
the
river
and
that
cry
with
a
thousand
strange
echoings
spread
till
the
ashes
of
heroes
seemed
stirred
in
their
bed
and
the
deep
voice
of
passion
surged
up
from
the
dead
ay
press
on
to
the
river
on
on
like
the
rushing
of
storms
through
the
hills
on
on
with
a
tramp
that
is
firm
as
their
wills
and
the
one
heart
of

grows
buoyant
and
thrills
as
they
pause
by

the
wan
face
of
maryland
haggard
and
worn
at
that
sight
lost
the
touch
of
its
aspect
forlorn
and
she
turned
on
the
foeman
full
statured

called
me
to
his
bedside
as
i
approached
i
saw
that
he
was
dying
and
when
i
bent
over
him
he
was
just
able
to
whisper
tell
the

the

is
ended
tell
the

the

these
were
all
the
words
he
said

an
instant
more
was
dead
strangely
bright
serene
and
cheerful
was
the
smile
upon

the

of
late
so
fearful
had
not
left
the
slightest
trace
tell
the

the

took
its
flight

the

low

thinking
of
the
soldiers
we
were
sitting
around
the
table
just
a
night
or
two
ago
in
the
little
cozy
parlor
with
the
burning
low
and
the
half
opened
for
the
summer
air
to
come
and
the
painted
curtains
moving
like
a
busy
pendulum
oh
the
cushions
on
the
sofa
and
the
pictures
on
the
wall
and
the
gathering
of
comforts
in
the
old
familiar
hall
and
the
wagging
of
the
pointer
lounging
idly
by
the
door
and
the
flitting
of
the
shadows
from
the
ceiling
to
the
floor
oh
they
wakened
in
my
spirit
like
the
beautiful
in
art
such
a
busy
busy
thinking
such
a
dreaminess
of
heart
that
i
sat
among
the
shadows
with
my
spirit
all
astray
thinking
only
thinking
only
of
the
soldiers
far
away
of
the
tents
beneath
the
moonlight
of
the
stirring
tattoo
sound
of
the
soldier
in
his
blanket
in
his
blanket
on
the
ground
of
the
icy
winter
coming
of
the
cold
bleak
winds
that
blow
and
the
soldier
in
his
blanket
in
his
blanket
on
the
snow
of
the
blight
upon
the
heather
and
the
frost
upon
the
hill
and
the
whistling
whistling
ever
and
the
never
never
still
of
the
little
leaflets
falling
with
the
sweetest
saddest
sound
and
the
soldier
oh
the
soldier
in
his
blanket
on
the
ground
thus
i
lingered
in
my
dreaming
in
my
dreaming
far
away
till
the
spirit
seemed
as
vivid
as
the
day
and
the
moonlight
faded
softly
from
the
window
opened
wide
and
the
faithful
faithful
pointer
nestled
closer
by
my
side
and
i
knew
that
the
starlight
though
the
chilly
frosts
may
fall
that
the
soldier
will
be
dreaming
dreaming
often
of
us
all
so
i
gave
my
spirit
painting
just
the
breathing
of
a
sound
for
the
dreaming
dreaming
soldier
in
his
slumber
on
the
ground

dying

james

him

your
footsteps

for
a

dying
in
the
sunset
radiant
glow
beating
beating
slowly
beating
runs
the
through
his
frame
swift
the
soldier
breath
is
fleeting
and
he
calls
his
mother
name

mother
come
and
kiss
me

my
spirit
fades

you
oft

your

around

at

the

him

his

me
for

lowering
in

be

who

her
desert
us

thy

but
you
hold
that

in

this
repentance
comes
no

than
the

did
at

he
repented
him
the

gave

poured
upon

sacred

in
the

of
his

a

then
he

for
the

in

he
was
shriven
the

was
given

the

with

upraised

down

they
bore

the

chanting
praise
to

came
to
do
him
christian

the

is
it
that
those

a

boys
none
ever
put
a

fling
out
our
glorious
banner
upon
the
golden
air
swear
by
its
stars
dishonor
shall
leave
no
footprint
there
that
ye
plant
its
broad
bars
firmly
as
a
barrier
to
the
foe
from
the
blue

to
the

from

the

boys
where
our
stately
cities
burn
but
as
monuments
of
fame
boys
their
ashes
we
oh
inch
by
inch
repel
him
the
foul
invading
foe
let
the
sharp
saber
tell
him
how
despots
are
laid
low
and
history
burning
pencil
will
on
her
golden
page
your
hero

enamel
an
honor
to

one

and
we

boys
strike
firmly
and
is
done
on
on
to
tennessee
boys
oh
follow
bravely
on
the
sword
of
robert
lee
by
father
ryan
forth
from
its
scabbard
pure
and
bright
flashed
the
sword
of
lee
far
in
the
front
of
the
deadly
fight
high
the
brave
in
the
cause
of
right
its
stainless
sheen
like
a
beacon
light
led
us
to
victory
out
of
its
scabbard
where
full
long
it
slumbered
peacefully
roused
from
its
rest
by
the
battle
song
shielding
the
feeble
smiting
the
strong
guarding
the
right
avenging
the
wrong
gleamed
the
sword
of
lee
forth
from
its
scabbard
high
in
air
beneath
virginia
sky
and
they
who
saw
it
gleaming
there
and
knew
who
bore
it
knelt
to
swear
that
where
that
sword
led
they
would
dare
to
follow
and
to
die
out
of
its
scabbard
never
hand
waved
sword
from
stain
as
free
nor
purer
sword
led
braver
band
nor
braver
bled
for
a
brighter
land
nor
brighter
land
had
a
cause
so
grand
nor
cause
a
chief
like
lee
forth
from
its
scabbard
how
we
prayed
that
sword
might
victor
be
and
when
our
triumph
was
delayed
and
many
a
heart
grew
sore
afraid
we
still
hoped
on
while
gleamed
the
blade
of
noble
robert
lee
forth
from
its
scabbard
all
in
vain
bright
flashed
the
sword
of
lee
is
shrouded
now
in
its
sheath
again
it
sleeps
the
sleep
of
our
noble
slain
defeated
yet
without
a
stain
proudly
and
peacefully
bombardment
of
vicksburg
by
paul
hayne
with
respect
and
admiration
to
earl
van
for
sixty
days
and
upwards
a
storm
of
shell
and
shot
rained
round
as
in
a
flaming
shower
but
still
we
faltered
not
if
the
noble
city
perish
our
grand
young
leader
said
let
the
only
walls
the
foe
shall
scale
be
ramparts
of
the
dead
for
sixty
days
and
upwards
the
eye
of
heaven
waxed
dim
and
even
throughout
god
holy
morn
christian
prayer
and
hymn
arose
a
hissing
tumult
as
if
the
fiends
of
air
strove
to
engulf
the
voice
of
faith
in
the
shrieks
of
their
despair
there
was
wailing
in
the
houses
there
was
trembling
on
the
marts
while
the
tempest
raged
and
thundered
the
silent
thrill
of
hearts
but
the
lord
our
shield
was
with
us
and
ere
a
month
had
sped
our
very
women
walked
the
streets
with
scarce
one
throb
of
dread
and
the
little
children
gamboled
their
faces
purely
raised
just
for
a
wondering
moment
as
the
huge
bombs
whirled
and
blazed
then
turning
with
silvery
laughter
to
the
sports
which
children
love
thrice
mailed
in
the
sweet
instinctive
thought
that
the
good
god
watched
above
yet
the
hailing
bolts
fell
faster
from
scores
of
ships
and
above
us
denser
darker
grew
the
conflict
wild
eclipse
till
a
solid
cloud
closed
us
like
a
type
of
doom
and
ire
whence
shot
a
thousand
quivering
tongues
of
forked
and
vengeful
fire
but
the
unseen
hands
of
angels
these
warned
aside
and
the
dove
of
heavenly
mercy
ruled
the
battle
tide
in
the
houses
ceased
the
wailing
and
through
the
marts
the
people
strode
with
the
step
of
hope
to
the
music
in
their
hearts
columbia
the
yankee
devil
by
rivers
the
nondescript
or
yankee
devil
for
clearing
the

was
washed
ashore
on

at
morris
island
and
is
now
in
our
possession
it
is
described
as
an
old
vessel
painted
red
with
a
long
protruding
beak
and
jutting
iron
prongs
and
claws
intended
for
the
removal
of
torpedoes
it
was
attached
to
the

and
managed
by
her
during
the
the

waiting
for
a
new

in
the
harbor
and

too
the
blackest
bluest
from
below
the
prince
of

he
came
his
iron
sides
with
beak
and
claws
and
fins
of
flame
to
plow
the
vernal
tides
like
serpents
which
minerva
sent
to
crush
the
trojan
sire
so
northern
devils
come
to
vent
on
charleston

this
northern

of

rarely

who

embattled
foes

in

for

and

should
fall

for
us
how

for

if
their

part
from

to
them
and
a

for

no
no
no

for
us
and
bright
were
the

they
gave
for
us

for

will
not
forget
its
warriors
yet
who
sleep
in
so
many
a

for
us
on
many
and
many
a
plain
for
us
their
blood
poured
down
all
in
vain
for
us
red
rich
and
pure
like
a
rain
for
us
they
bleed
we
weep
we
live
they
sleep
all
lost
the
only
refrain
for
us
but
their
memories
shall
remain
for
us
and
their
names
bright
names
without
stain
for
us
the
glory
they
won
shall
not
wane
for
us
in

unsheathed

charge
on

harmonious
chorus
for

that

he
fights

he
has
riven
the

he
comes
like
the

whose
veil
so
resplendent
his
monstrous

closely
concealed
duplicity
marks

libations
we
poured
we
rallied
around
the

standard
when
called
to
the
field
by
the
tocsin
of
war
but
they
from
our
side
have
unfeeling
wandered
and
we
strip
from
our

every
recusant
star
they
have
forced
us
to
stand
by
our

constitution
to
defend

our

while
they
tamely
submit

mournful
groups
there
are
i

with
neither

where
happy
feet
went
to

are
sickening
sights

of

there
is
a
god
who
rules
on

the
widow
and
the
orphan
friend
who
sees
each
tear
and
hears
each
sigh
that
these

hearts
to

send

when
in

he
tears

upon

round
its

is
drooping
dreary
furl

let

rest
for
there
not

there
not

that

gave

furl

take
that

down
is
tattered
broken
is
its

and
shattered
and
the
valiant
hearts
are
scattered
over
whom
it
floated
high
oh
is
hard
for
us
to
fold
it
hard
to
think
there
none
to
hold
it
hard
that
those
who
once
unrolled
it
now
must
furl
it
with
a
sigh
furl
that
banner
furl
it
sadly
once
six
millions
hailed
it
gladly
and
three
hundred
thousand
madly
swore
it
should
forever
wave
swore
that
foeman
sword
should
never
hearts
like
theirs
entwined
dissever
that
their
flag
should
float
forever
their
freedom
or
their
grave
furl
it
for
the
hands
that
grasped
it
and
the
hearts
that
fondly
clasped
it
cold
and
dead
are
lying
low
and
that
banner
it
is
trailing
while
around
it
sounds
the
wailing
of
its
people
in
their
woe
for
though
conquered
they
adore
it
love
the
cold
dead
hands
that
bore
it
weep
for
those
who
fell
before
it
oh
how
wildly
they
deplore
it
now
to
furl
and
fold
it
so
furl
that
banner
true
is
gory
but
is
wreathed
around
with
glory
and
live
in
song
and
story
though
its
folds
are
in
the
dust
for
its
fame
on
brightest
pages
sung
by
poets
penned
by
sages
shall
go
sounding
down
to
ages
furl
its
folds
though
now
we
must
furl
that
banner
softly
slowly
furl
it
gently
it
is
holy
for
it
droops
above
the
dead
touch
it
not
unfurl
it
never
let
it
droop
there
furled
forever
for
its
people
hopes
are
fled
fold
it
up
carefully
gallant
nation
foiled
by
numbers
say
not
that
your
hopes
are
fled
keep
that
glorious
flag
which
slumbers
one
day
to
avenge
your
dead
keep
it
till
your
children
take
it
once
again
to
hail
and
make
it
all
their

then
once

why

the
battle
now
is
we
laid
our
bruis
arms
on
the
field
to
take
them
up
no
more
we
who
have
fought
you
hard
and
long
now
overpower
stand
as
poor
defenseless
prisoners
in
our
own
native
land
we
know
that
we
are
rebels
and
we
do
deny
the
name
we
speak
of
that
which
we
have
done
with
grief
but
not
with
shame
but
we
have
rights
most
sacred
by
solemn
compact
bound
seal
by
the
blood
that
freely
gush
from
many
a
ghastly
wound
when
lee
gave
up
his
trusty
sword
and
his
men
laid
down
their
arms
it
was
that
they
should
live
at
home
secure
from
war
dire
harms
and
surely
since
we
now
disarm
we
are
not
to
be
dreaded
our
old
chiefs
who
on
many
fields
our
trusty
columns
headed
are
fast
within
an
iron
grasp
and
manacled
with
chains
perchance
dreary
walls
to
stay
as
long
as
life
remains
oh
shame
upon
the
coward
band
who
in
the
conflict
dire
went
not
to
battle
for
their
cause
the
ranks
of
steel
and
fire
yet
now
since
all
the
fighting
done
are
hourly
heard
to
cry
down
with
the
traitors
hang
them
all
each
rebel
dog
shall
die
we
know
that
we
were
rebels
we
do
deny
the
name
we
speak
of
that
which
we
have
done
with
grief
but
not
with
shame
and
we
never
will
acknowledge
that
the
blood
the
south
has
spilt
was
shed

we

a

by

to
contribute

these
verses
were
published
early
in
in
the
raleigh
register
from
the
camp
of
the
massachusetts
regiment
they
were
sent
as
a
part
of
a
letter
to
the
boston
traveller
on
may
of
the
same
year
and
printed
in
that
paper
on
the
of
june
a
good
clergyman
on
being
censured
for
introducing
a
song
tune
into

at

replied
that

it

manner

one
of
our
dearest
rights
this
the
grandest
march
ever
composed
by
mortal
man
this
song
was
very
popular
with
the
southern
troops
and
was
sung
with
great
effect
to
the
measure
of
ye
mariners
of
england
this
song
was
published
in
the
memphis
appeal
in
december
was
a
great
favorite
with
tennessee
troops
and
was
sung
even
after
the
peace
was
declared
it
may
add
something
to
the
interest
with
which
these
stirring
lines
will
be
read
to
know
that
they
were
composed
within
the
walls
of
a
yankee
bastile
they
reach

note
that
the

him
should
be
paid
over
for
the

not

that
in
