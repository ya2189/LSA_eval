ballads
of
peace
in
war
by
michael
earls
his
light
gray
mist
on
the
sea
and
the
night
coming
down
she
stays
with
sorrow
in
a
far
town
he
goes
the
by
channel
lights
dim
her
love
a
true
light
watches
for
him
they
would
be
wedded
on
a
fair
yesterday
but
the
quick
regiment
saw
him
away
gray
mist
in
her
eyes
and
the
night
coming
down
he
feels
a
prayer
from
a
far
town
he
goes
the
the
land
lights
are
dim
she
and
an
altar
light
keep
watch
for
him
the
countersign
along
virginia
wondering
roads
while
armies
hastened
on
to
beauregard
great
southern
host
manassas
fields
upon
came
colonel
smith
good
regiment
eager
for
washington
but
colonel
smith
must
halt
his
men
in
a
dangerous
delay
though
well
he
knows
the
countryside
to
the
distant
host
of
grey
he
can
not
join
with
beauregard
for
bull
run
bloody
fray
and
does
he
halt
for
storm
or
ford
or
does
he
stay
to
dine
say
no
but
death
will
meet
his
men
onward
if
moves
the
line
he
dares
not
hurry
to
beauregard
not
knowing
the
countersign
flashed
in
the
sun
his
waving
sword
who
rides
for
me
he
cried
and
ask
of
the
chief
the
countersign
upon
a
daring
ride
though
never
the
lad
come
back
again
with
the
good
that
will
betide
i
will
send
a
letter
to
beauregard
the
colonel
slowly
said
the
bearer
dies
at
the
pickets
line
but
the
letter
shall
be
read
when
the
pickets
find
it
for
the
chief
in
the
brave
hand
of
the
dead
the
countersign
ready
i
ride
to
the
chief
for
the
sign
said
little
dan
though
never
i
come
from
the
picket
line
but
a
faded
suit
of
grey
yet
over
my
death
will
the
road
be
safe
and
the
regiment
march
away
in
a
mother
name
i
bless
thee
lad
the
colonel
drew
him
near
but
first
in
the
name
of
god
said
dan
and
then
is
my
mother
dear
her
own
good
lips
that
taught
me
well
with
the
cross
of
christ
no
fear
quickly
he
rode
by
valley
and
hill
on
to
the
outpost
line
till
the
pickets
arise
by
wall
and
mound
and
the
levelled
muskets
shine
halt
they
cried
count
three
to
death
or
give
us
the
countersign
lightly
the
lad
leaped
from
his
steed
no
fear
was
in
his
sigh
but
a
mother
face
and
a
home
he
loved
under
an
irish
sky
he
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
and
stood
bravely
he
stood
to
die
lips
in
a
prayer
at
the
blessed
sign
and
calmly
he
looked
around
and
wonder
seized
his
waiting
soul
to
hear
no
musket
sound
but
only
the
pickets
calling
to
him
heartily
up
the
mound
for
this
was
the
order
of
beauregard
around
his
camp
that
day
the
sign
of
the
cross
was
countersign
and
a
blessing
to
dan
and
the
word
came
quick
to
colonel
smith
for
the
muster
of
the
grey
a
hill
o
lights
turn
from
kerry
crossroads
and
leave
the
wooded
dells
take
the
mountain
path
and
find
where
tip
dwells
tip
is
the
name
i
sing
it
all
day
long
and
every
bird
whose
heart
is
wise
will
have
it
for
a
song
tip
keeps
the
lights
of
many
lamps
aglow
little
matters
it
to
him
the
seasons
come
or
go
sure
if
spring
is
in
the
air
his
hedges
are
abloom
and
fairy
buds
like
candles
shine
across
his
garden
room
roses
in
the
june
days
are
light
the
miles
around
tapers
of
the
fuchsias
move
along
the
august
ground
sumachs
light
the
flaming
torches
by
october
grave
and
like
the
campfires
on
the
hills
the
oaks
and
maples
wave
all
the
lights
but
only
one
die
out
when
summer
goes
one
that
tip
keeps
is
brighter
than
the
rose
through
the
window
comes
the
bloom
on
any
winter
night
and
every
sense
goes
wild
to
it
soft
and
sweet
and
bright
lamps
are
fair
that
have
the
light
from
flowers
all
day
long
when
the
birds
are
here
and
sing
the
tip
song
but
a
winter
window
is
the
fairest
rose
of
all
when
tip
hearth
is
lit
and
lamps
upon
the
wall
off
to
the
war
for
jack
in
a
little
ship
and
down
the
bay
out
to
the
calling
sea
a
young
brave
lad
sailed
off
today
to
the
one
great
war
went
he
the
one
long
war
all
men
must
know
greater
than
land
or
gold
soul
is
the
prince
and
flesh
the
foe
of
a
kingdom
christ
will
hold
with
arms
of
faith
and
hope
the
brave
lad
went
away
and
the
voice
of
christ
fills
all
his
thought
under
two
hands
that
pray
the
tender
love
of
a
mother
hands
that
guarded
all
his
years
fitted
the
armor
plate
and
bands
and
blessed
them
with
her
tears
older
than
rhodes
and
ascalon
and
the
farthest
forts
of
sea
is
the
master
voice
that
calls
him
on
from
the
hills
in
galilee
from
hills
where
christ
in
gentle
guise
called
as
he
calls
again
with
his
heart
of
love
and
his
eyes
unto
his
warrior
men
christ
with
the
brave
young
lad
who
goes
to
the
sweet
command
strengthen
his
heart
wherever
the
way
whether
he
march
or
stand
and
whether
he
die
in
a
peaceful
cell
or
alone
in
the
lonely
night
the
cross
of
christ
shall
keep
him
well
and
be
his
death
delight
the
towers
of
holy
cross
for
letts
the
roads

up
to

down

the
philosophers
the
best
of
true
philosophers
are
the
children
after
all
the
children
with
laughing
hearts
and
the
serious
field
and
ball
they
have
a
bowl
and
bubbles
and
hours
where
rainbows
are
they
find
if
ever
the
sun
is
hid
in
every
dark
a
star
but
o
the
sorry
men
that
make
the
wise
books
of
our
day
they
can
not
smile
athwart
a
cloud
when
black
thoughts
lead
astray
they
can
not
add
a
simple
sum
but
talk
like
drunken
men
and
shut
their
eyes
to
keep
out
god
when
spring
comes
in
again
far
simpler
than
the
rule
of
three
are
the
laws
of
earth
and
sky
yet
fools
will
muddle
all
true
thought
and
pride
will
have
its
cry
the
banners
with
their
deadly
words
go
reeling
on
unfurled
and
sin
and
sadness
march
along
to
the
heartbreak
of
the
world
the
philosophers
but
the
children
are
the
wise
men
with
the
clearest
heart
and
mind
if
two
and
one
are
three
they
say
then
truth
is
near
to
find
if
this
be
now
that
once
was
not
if
things
must
have
a
cause
then
very
simple
is
the
sum
that
god
is
in
his
laws
the
world
men
that
are
fools
enough
they
will
not
speak
that
way
but
with
a
cloud
of
muddled
thought
they
hide
the
light
of
day
yet
laughing
words
and
candid
truth
abide
by
field
and
hall
where
the
best
of
true
philosophers
are
the
children
after
all
preparedness
i
the
drummer
boy
you
never
know
when
war
may
come
and
that
is
why
i
keep
a
drum
for
if
all
sudden
in
the
night
from
east
or
west
came
battle
fright
and
you
were
sound
asleep
in
bed
and
very
soon
to
join
the
dead
you
then
would
gladly
wish
my
drum
would
warn
you
that
the
war
had
come
so
that
is
why
on
afternoons
i
tell
the
neighborhood
my
tunes
sometimes
behind
a
fortress
bench
or
where
the
hedges
make
a
trench
i
beat
the
drum
with
all
my
might
while
people
look
with
awful
fright
just
as
they
would
if
war
had
come
and
heard
the
warning
of
my
drum
they
must
be
thankful
i
am
sure
because
they
now
may
feel
secure
and
rest
so
safe
and
sound
in
bed
without
wild
dreams
of
fearful
dread
for
now
they
hear
me
all
the
day
as
round
the
yard
i
march
and
play
to
let
them
know
if
war
should
come
they
get
the
warning
of
my
drum
ii
the
sailor
a
sailor
that
rides
the
ocean
wave
and
i
in
my
room
at
home
where
are
the
seas
i
fear
to
brave
or
the
lands
i
may
not
roam
at
the
attic
window
i
take
my
stand
and
tighten
the
curtain
sail
then
ahoy
i
ride
the
leagues
of
land
whether
in
calm
or
gale
tree
at
anchor
along
the
road
bow
as
i
speed
along
at
sunny
brooks
in

i
load
cargoes
of

and
song
stories
i
take
on
the
passing
wind
from
the
plains

and
the
golden

i
yet
will
find
and
the

steady
i
keep
my
watchful

as
i
range
the

till
evening
tides
in

turn
gold
the

then
fast
is
the
hatch
and
dark
the

and
i
bring

together

joe
was

with
bill
at

bill
was
home
to
joe
alway
on
their
friendship
came
the
blight
of
a
little
thoughtless
fight
then
alas
each
passing
day
farther
bore
these
friends
away
there
was
grief
in
either
heart
bleeding
deep
from
sorrow
dart
when
in
thoughtfulness
again
each
beheld
the
other
pain
but
the
shades
of
night
are
furled
when
the
morning
takes
the
world
and
the
christmas
days
of
peace
make
our
little
quarrels
cease
bill
and
joe
on

in

bill
put
out
his

to
joe
it

all
have
known

round

the
noisy
streets

high
the
grassless
ground
is
brown

hard

the
cinder
pathways
lined
with
shard
sees
but
a
bit
of
sky
once
the
yard
was
fertile
and
fair
and
lilac
bushes
near

a
yankee
counted
with
fretful
care
under
the
solacing
shadows
there
the
gain
of
every

the
crowded
walls
of

arose
and
gloomed

a
munster
man
at

close
built
in
the
tree
his
hope
rainbows
and
saw
his
dreams
come
true
the
years
have
thickened
the
darkened
air

the

is
still
on

the

was
it
a

we
found
the

of

maybe
it
was

yesterday
or
a

the

the

the

brings
no

there

ten
thousand

of

that
we
shall
see
our

pass
the

to
a

forever
in

the

at

with
their
waving
blades

spears
and
across

they
are
marching
fast
with
the
drill
of
a
thousand
years
and
i
wave
afar
and
i
shout
hurrah
till
i
hear
their
echoing
cheers
a
bonnie
prince
is
at
their
head
and
his
love
the
legions
know
for
he
gives
them
rest
where
the
twigs
are
red
at
the
hedges
cool
in
a
row
and
afoot
are
they
soon
to
a
birdlike
tune
on
the
northward
march
to
go
oh
i
am
leal
to
the
marching

to
my
bonnie
prince
i
true
for
he
tells
me
the
way
to
his
tented
glen
and
the
secret
password
too
and
he
sets
in
my
hair
a
blossom
to
wear
like
his
own
good
horsemen
do
then
i
will
follow
on
all
the
day
where
the
bonnie

has
led
till
we
drive

read
a
magazine
they
were
young
and
trains
are
dull
at
night
all
the
passing
signals
red
and
blue
and
green
counted
up
the
miles
for
young
delight
i
was
there
behind
them
earnest
in
a
book
lo
the
journey
turned
to
fairyland
when
like
magic
mirrors
dusty
windows
took
aileen
dancing
eyes
and
waving
hand
that
is
how
it
happened
on
a
creeping
train
how
a
play
began
without
a
word
peekaboo
reflections
in
a
such
a
was
never
heard
aileen
and
her
brother
strangers
were
to
me
they
were
friendly
for
the
cloth
i
wore
and
through
leagues
of
window
youthful
play
could
see
we
were
friends
to
be
for
evermore
so
we
passed
the
hamlets
passed
the
miles
of
night
in
a
fairyland
of
silent
games
till
the
travel
ended
in
the
worcester
light
yet
we
parted
strangers
in
our
names
but
a
fortnight
later
by
an
autumn
tree
aileen
and
her
brother
came
my
way
and
another
glad
to
tell
the
names
of
them
and
me
and
to
hear
how
travellers
can
play
life
is
but
a
journey
say
we
evermore
passing
lights
the
years
have
like
a
train
three
good
friends

our
praise
unto
a
jewelled
queen
in
all
her
courtly
splendor
set
fair
as
those
fairylands
are
seen
by
childhood
other
sight
but
if
in
pauper
mien
too
poor
for
stray
regret
where
crowded
streets
affright
she
stood
in
beggary
unknown
though
faithful
to
her
high
degree
o
then
her
praise
easy
to
forget
yet
ever
here
for
all
of

prompt
fickleness
from
plenteous
june
and
wide
largess
of
full
midsummer
days
to
dwarf
december
pitiless
amid
the
earth
uncomplimented
ways
yea
constant
through
the
changeful
year
this
queenly
height
commands
our
praise
to
stand
in
meek
unflinching
hardihood
when
fortune
blows
its
storm
of
fright
and
work
to
full
effect
that
good
resolved
in
open
days
of
clearer
sight
o
this
is
worth
that
daily
sees
the
soul
to
braver
liberties
give
birth
that
heeds
not
time
annoy
and
hears
surrounding
voices
roll
perennial
circumstance
of
joy
then
come
not
only
when
the
springtime
blows
the
old
familiar
strangeness
of
its
breath
across
the
snows
and
chants
her
resurrected
songs
about
the
tombs
of
death
nor
yet
when
summer
glows
in
roseate
throngs
and
works
her
plenitude
of
deeds
by
tangled
dells
and
waving
meads
come
here
in
beauty
pilgrimage
nor
when
the
autumn
reads
illuminate
her
page
with
tints
of
magicry
besprent
of
iridescent
wonderment
as
scrolls
in
old
monastic
towers
done
in
an
earnest
age
but
choose
to
come
in
winter
hours
to
see
how
character
can
live
how
noble
character
will
give
through
desolate
distress
and
cold
neglect
duress
the
fulness
of
its
powers
and
win
the
soul
its
victor
sign
yea
come
when
in
a
peasant
gown
amid
the
ample
banners
of
the
pine
and
the
resounding
harpers
of
the
vine
lone
winter
holds
upon
the
height
her
court
in
full
renown
obedient
her
courtiers
go
their
gonfalons
aloft
and
bright
and
scatter
pearls
of
snow
her
sturdy
knighthood
wear
for
crown
prismatic
sheen
in
young
delight
and
wave
the
cedar
oriflamme
on
high
while
windward
heralds
cry
across
the
battlements
of
earth
to
parapets
along
the
sky
the
lauds
of
character
full
worth
the
winter
passes
and
the
days
come
in
vibrant
with
spring
and
men
find
welcome
at
the
easter
tomb
reward
they
win
who
make
their
hearts
with
courage
sing
through
lenten
opportunity
of
gloom
not
as
the
pharisees
with
faces
lacrimose
who
wear
pretence
of
ashen
woes
and
murmur
like
the
tuneless
bees
whose
honies
are
hypocrisies
but
men
of
character
delight
who
like
this
valiant
height
still
serving
through
the
bleakest
day
with
humble
offerings
of
sound
and
sight
do
steadfast
stand
and
pray
o
count
those
souls
of
noble
worth
and
god
good
pleasure
on
his
earth
who
still
if
joy
or
pain
brings
sun
or
rain
heroic
sing
the
law
of
alleluia
to
the
king
