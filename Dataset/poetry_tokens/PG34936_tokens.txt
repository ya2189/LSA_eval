with

the

is
mad
his
flight
from

was
bad
enough
but
that
could
be
excused
for
six
months
now
what
has
he
done
but
drink
carouse
and
wallow
in
lascivious
ease
while
subjects
driven
to
despair
with
tax
have
fallen
on
the
poisoned
sword
and
cursed
in
death
the
son
of
their
once
goodly
king
ahafid
you
do
seem
to
think
the
first
great
business
of
a
king
is
war
now
pray
you
why
should
xerxes
waste
the
lusty
days
of
youth
in
bloody
strife
to
furnish
themes
no
doubt
for
dullard
bards
and
minstrelsy
ahasuerus
is
the
wisest
king
that
ever
sat
upon
a
persian
throne
you
graybeard
fool
stupid
as
poets
are
can
you
not
see
the
wisdom
of
our
king
in
substitution
of
the
flight
for
death
of
feast
for
fight
of
wine
for
blood
think
you
is
wise
to
wear
the
plaited
mail
of
mars
when
venus
bids
you
to
the
festival
of
love
you
call
me
then
a
graybeard
fool
though
i
have
dropped
the
purple
bloom
of
spring
the
autumn
silvery
down
may
indicate
the
ripened
fruit
of
wisdom
which
your
youth
has
never
tasted
smerdis
you
are
blind
my
beard
is
white
but
vision
clear
the
king
does
daily
waste
the
substance
of
his
realm
and
nightly
dissipates
his
energies
in
vices
of
the
blood
vashti
the
queen
the
idol
of
her
people
is
in
grief
in
grief
for
what
does
she
too
wish
the
king
to
take
the
field
i
know
our
queen
is
fair
of
face
and
most
voluptuous
of
form
perhaps
her
grief
is
due
to
jealousy
would
she
monopolize
his
love
because
her
beauty
is
surpassing
vashti
does
not
know
that
she
is
beautiful
she
loves
her
country
and
is
brave
as
well
as
good
i
dread
the
issue
of
this
night
the
king
has
ordered
that
the
queen
be
brought
before
the
court
a
target
for
licentious
eyes
she
will
refuse
to
go
because
her
heart
is
pure
ahasuerus
flushed
with
wine
will
brook
no
opposition
to
his
will
a
tragedy
that
never
persia
knew
will
see
the
rising
of
sun
a
tragedy
no
country
ever
knew
a
woman
who
is
beautiful
but
does
know
it
true
oh
for
a
song
to
cleanse
the
heart
or
touch
the
sceptred
power
oh
might
the
gods
a
strength
impart
to
meet
this
tragic
hour
ahafid
and
vashti
and
oh
zethar
do
you
think
this
night
will
end
the
revels
that
dishonor
persia
king
unknown
i
strolled
through
squalid
parts
of
this
old
city
and
observed
the
poor
my
lord
unmindful
of
their
misery
has
laid
a
heavy
tax
for
his
insane
extravagance
upon
the
helpless
child
that
begs
in
shushan
streets
not
here
alone
this
suffering
but
persia
peasantry
the
glory
of
the
old
empire
the
heart
that
once
defied
the
world
is
broken
on
the
wheel
of
tax
and
all
for
what
o
queen
always
the
world
has
had
its
poverty
you
shall
forget
the
poor
one
stoop
of
wine
will
bring
you
happiness
vashti

forgive
me
zethar

no
wine
meheuman
biztha
and
our
most
imperial
queen
the
king
has
laid
a
banquet
in
the
palace
garden
court
the
crowning
act
of
that
munificence
toward
prince
and
people
great
and
small
alike
ahasuerus
now
for
many
months
has
shown
the
loyal
subjects
of
his
realm
the
adornment
of
the
court
displays
a
rich
magnificence
of
taste
the
couches
are
of
fretted
gold
and
silver
set
upon
a
pavement
of
mosaic
inlaid
stone
the
drinking
is
according
to
the
law
none
can
compel
each
vessel
is
diverse
but
all
of
gold
th
abundance
of
the
wine
shows
the
unstinted
bounty
of
the
king
our
monarch
heart
is
merry
in
the
cup
and
boasts
that
vashti
beauty
does
excel
in
magic
power
the
fabled
helen
charms
and
bids
us
bring
immediately
before
the
court
great
persia
matchless
queen
meheuman
tell
ahasuerus
i
must
thank
his
majesty
since
he
can
still
remember
vashti
beauty
though
his
grace
has
lost
all
sense
of
modesty
and
shame
you
say
his
heart
is
merry
now
in
wine
and
that
he
glories
with
exceeding
pride
because
my
face
is
fair
to
look
upon
i
do
not
doubt
his
tongue
is
eloquent
the
fiery
phrase
is
his
why
often
i
have
heard
him
praise
his
horse
in
language
that
seemed
kindled
at
the
altar
of
the
gods
it
may
be
that
he
holds
me
higher
than
his
hundred
concubines
your
majesty
the
king
does
hold
his
queen
a
goddess
well
perhaps
he
thinks
himself
divine
go
tell
the
king
i
do
not
wish
to
be
enrolled
among
divinities
i
am
the
queen
he
must
respect
me
as
the
one
who
wears
the
persian
crown
is
scarce
three
years
since
he
began
to
reign
he
was
darius
son
a
king
of
whom
the
world
was
proud
he
wooed
me
as
a
prince
of
noble
blood
and
i
received
his
hand
with
dignity
as
well
as
love
i
was
a
princess
but
i
had
a
heart
long
since
i
found
that
he
had
none
a
hundred
eighty
days
continuous
feast
he
has
oppressed
the
people
of
his
rule
with
drunken
revels
and
with
wanton
waste
and
now
to
crown
his
sensuality
he
sends
his
vulgar
chamberlains
to
bring
me
to
his
palace
garden
that
his
lords
may
gaze
with
unchaste
eyes
upon
my
form
meheuman
biztha
will
you
tell
the
king
that
vashti
bids
him
come
to
her
if
he
would
see
the
queen
you
understand
the
costly
hangings
of
the
garden
court
are
blue
and
green
and
white
now
pray
you
what
significance
has
that
what
if
each
couch
is
gold
and
silver
and
each
goblet
set
with
stones
the
king
great
love
for
vashti
then
he
has
prepared
this
banquet
for
his
queen
and
does
he
think
this
is
an
evidence
of
love
it
rather
means
the
king
debauched
i
will
not
be
a
party
to
his
sin
the
etiquette
of
court
commands
you
to
obey
commands
well
has
it
come
to
that
but
i
will
not
obey
i
am
a
queen
here
take
this
purple
robe
and
coronet
and
tell
ahasuerus
to
adorn
some
harlot
of
his
harem
she
will
grace
the
queenship
of
his
kingdom
better
than
a
pure
and
modest
wife
you
do
not
know
the
meaning
of
your
words
abagtha
why
do
you
admonish
me
do
i
not
know
the
forfeit
chamberlains
this
message
take
licentious
xerxes
from
his
virtuous
queen
i
do
not
fear
his
wrath
i
will
not
come
at
his
command
i
have
a
royal
heart
and
will
not
thus
disgrace
the
persian
throne
the
king
that
halfway
worthy
of
my
hand
would
hate
the
queen
that
yielded
to
his
lust
my
heart
o
chamberlains
is
broken
not
that
vashti
crown
is
lost
but
oh
to
see
the
regal
name
of
persia
brought
so
low
i
weep
the
tears
are
for
my
country

where
mordecai
the

is
ah
esther
though
your
queenly
robe
you
do
conceal
i
know
that
regal
gait
before
i
ever
looked
upon
these
palace
walls
when
you
were
yet
a
little
child
beyond
the
purple
peaks
where
shepherds
led
their
flocks
in
pastures
green
i
often
dreamed
that
you
would
one
day
wear
a
golden
coronet
and
sit
in
majesty
upon
a
throne
four
years
i
have
been
queen
which
time
i
have
not
heard
the
voice
of
any
one
i
love
and
though
disguised
i
hardly
dare
to
speak
my
heart
even
to
you
this
palace
is
a
gloomy
prison
cell
the
persian
crown
is
meaningless
to
me
the
hundred
gems
that
blaze
upon
its
field
of
gold
are
dull
and
heavy
lead
i
would
exchange
it
all
for
but
a
glint
of
sunshine
on
the
hills
where
i
was
born
but
why
this
interview
my
royal
niece
i
know
that
you
are
queen
a
queen
but
what
of
that
though
of
my
blood
you
can
not
even
look
upon
my
face
what
would
you
have
my
daughter
do
you
hear
the
cries
of
anguish
that
disturb
the
peace
of
shushan
streets
your
people
everywhere
are
clothed
in
sackcloth
read
the
king
decree
her
it
has
been
written
and
commanded
by
ahasuerus
emperor
of
all
the
east
and
sealed
in
every
tongue
with
his
own
ring
the
royal
seal
that
governors
and
princes
and
lieutenants
everyone
within
the
persian
rule
shall
make
and
cause
to
die
and
perish
every
jew
both
young
and
old
the
women
and
the
children
rich
and
poor
alike
and
forfeit

this
is
ahasuerus
sovereign
will
and
shall
be
done
and
executed
in
the
month
of
adar
on
the
thirteenth
day
oh
god
it
is
ahasuerus
seal
but
haman
hand
why
does
the
premier
hate
the
jews
because
the
children
of
the
true
and
living
god
will
never
bend
the
knee
to
heathen
pride
he
hates
the
jews
because
your
uncle
is
a
child
of
abraham
and
will
not
do
obeisance
to
a
son
of
baal
esther
though
i
made
you
queen
i
plead
not
for
the
life
of
mordecai
but
for
the
sacred
blood
of
israel
you
alone
can
intervene
go
straight
before
the
king
and
make
demand
that
he
reverse
this
law
that
puts
the
jews
to
death
a
persian
king
can
not
reverse
his
own
decree
besides
the
queen
who
goes
into
the
presence
of
her
lord
unless
by
his
express
command
must
sacrifice
her
life
except
through
some
unguarded
impulse
he
extends
his
golden

she
live

your
life
is
forfeited
already
child
you
are

you
did
conceal
my
blood
nor

reveal
my
lineage
now
your
own
deceit
has
brought
this
death
upon
the
house
of
israel
nor
will
jehovah
hold
you
guiltless
in
the
hour
of
doom
esther
if
you
keep
your
peace
when
rachel
children
wail
and
cry
for
help
deliverance
will
arise
unto
the
jews
but
you
shall
be
destroyed
and
all
your
father
house
depart

why
did
you

what
you
most
desire
and
i
will
give
it
you
my

but
you
will
not

to

i
would
ask
of
you
but
first
that
my
most
gracious
lord
may
know
his

taste
and

as
well
as

that
graces

let
ahasuerus
come

and
if
my
lord
shall
praise
my
art
and
i
find
favor
in
his
sight
i
will
make
known
my
dearest
wish

messages
of
enmity
are
swift
as
shafts
of
love
now
zeresh
call
the
servants
of
the
house
and
set
a
sumptuous
feast
for
haman
would
take
counsel
of
his
friends
my
gracious
lord
the
table
is
already
set
go
greet
the
guests
and
bring
them
in
parshandatha
what
do
you
think
of
haman
did
you
note
my
lord
i
did
madam
his
happiness
is
most
complete
his
rapid
rise
to
power
has
all
but
ravished
him
with
joy
and
yet
methought
that
something
still
he
lacked
perhaps
the
queen
consent
has
not
yet
been
obtained
to
this
decree
that
puts
the
jews
to
death
what
do
you
mean
the
queen
consent
my
lord
has
naught
to
do
with
xerxes
wife
and
why
should
he
be
troubled
for
a
woman
whim
besides
who
knows
but
esther
does
approve
this
slaughter
of
the
jews
approve
madam
she
is
a
queen
but
still
a
woman
so
am
i
though
not
a
queen
a
woman
yes
but
with
no
stomach
for
that
hated
race
is
whispered
in
the
court
that
esther
is
herself
a
jew
the
persian
queen
a
jew
then
let
her
perish
with
her
blood
but
would
my
lord
consent
to
esther
death
consent
again
parshandatha
why
do
you
harp
upon
consent
now
listen
to
my
words
but
should
you
disclose
one
breath
of
what
i
say
you
are
yourself
a
jew
nor
is
there
any
power
in
persia
king
to
save
your
life
my
lord
pretends
to
hate
the
jews
his
hate
is
only
wounded
pride
the
deference
of
mordecai
is
all
that
haman
wants
he
does
not
know
the
queen
is
hebrew
blood
this
fact
must
still
be
kept
concealed
concealed
that
is
until
the
day
of
death
oh
he
shall
know
who
esther
is
this
israelite
that
banquets
with
my
lord
you
think
his
rise
is
due
to
esther
power
madam
i
do
not
know
not
know
not
know
but
what
think
you
parshandatha
of
course
you
do
not
know
madam
he
often
dines
with
esther
and
the
king
the
king
no
doubt
is
very
fond
of
your
most
gracious
lord
the
king
mayhap
the
queen
also
your
lord
is
young
and
handsome
still
the
king
is
far
beyond
the
queen
in
years
i
can
not
catch
your
drift
madam
your
husband
has
a
ready
wit
the
queen
enjoys
life
enjoys
life
and
so
do
i
and
likewise
death
now
hold
your
blasted
tongue
my
husband
sups
again
with
the
jewish
queen
they
say
when
haman
dines
her
majesty
prepares
the
banquet
with
her
own
most
dainty
hand
parshandatha
whose
hand
think
you
has
laid
the
feast
of
adar
zeresh
call
you
death
a
feast
a
glorious
feast
on
which
my
soul
already
feeds
and
esther
shall
be
there
haman
and
be
seated
at
the
table
citizens
of
shushan
patriots
of
persia
friends
the
servant
of
the
king
has
called
you
here
to
tell
you
of
his
triumph
and
to
ask
your
sage
advice
two
days
ago
the
prince
and
i
sat
down
together
to
a
feast
within
the
palace
walls
and
drank
your
health
the
royal
cup
was
blushing
like
the
spume
of
autumn
clouds
at
sunset
when
a
wail
arose
in
shushan
that
has
sore
perplexed
the
people
mordecai
the
haughty
jew
who
sits
beside
the
palace
gate
refused
to
bow
or
do
me
reverence
although
admonished
by
the
king
i
was
born
a
humble
subject
in
the
private
ranks
of
life
but
now
i
wear
the
signet
ring
of
xerxes
friends
the
law
that
dooms
the
jews
to
simultaneous
slaughter
can
not
be
revoked
last
night
the
queen
invited
me
to
banquet
with
her
lord
the
necklace
that
she
wore
of
iridescent
pearls
was
like
a
rainbow
over
polar
snows
ah
she
was
fair
to
look
upon
and
now
my
cup
was
filled
to
overflowing
shows
great
zeresh
are
you
ill
when
esther
begged
that
i
would
come
again
to
another
feast
her
hand
would
lay
for
haman
and
the
king
my
wealth
is
multiplied
beyond
my
ken
the
sceptre
is
almost
within
my
grasp
but
all
these
things
avail
me
naught
so
long
as
yonder
hated
jew
remains
unbent
destroy
the
brute
at
once
oh
that
will
not
suffice
is
not
his
death
but
homage
that
must
sweeten
my
revenge
ah
i
would
see
him
groveling
on
the
earth
as
haman
passed
my
rank
and
station
must
be
recognized
i
sit
beside
the
king
i
am
premier
of
persia
yet
this
jewish
dog
is
still
unmoved
hang
him
where
the
kites
will
eat
his
eyes
o
zeresh
you
are
like
the
rising
sun
an
inspiration
in
the
hour
of
gloom
we
build
this
gallows
fifty
cubits
high
and
then
his
hebrew
pride
will
bite
the
dust
oh
i
can
hear
him
whining
like
a
cur
my
love
your
wisdom
is
above
the
head
a
woman
heart
is
like
an
oracle
divine
prepare
this
gallows
friends
i
go
at
dawn
to
greet
the
king
at
night
we
dine
alone
with
esther
and
why
zeresh
are
you
ill
again
send
for
the
leech
her
blood
is
over
wrought
with
too
much
happiness
act
ii
scene
i
place
the
palace
of
the
king
outer
room
of
banquet
hall
curtain
back
meheuman
biztha
and
ahafid
has
become
most
deaf
of
late
advancing
age
has
wrought
a
piteous
change
in
him
he
can
not
understand
our
king
is
not
the
king
but
age
that
makes
him
groan
i
mean
this
age
the
age
in
which
we
live
and
biztha
exeunt
on
the
opposite
side
of
stage
as
ahafid
enters
more
stooped
and
a
country
but
no
king
an
empire
but
no
throne
an
upstart
wears
the
signet
ring
my
harp
has
lost
its
tone
i
can
no
longer
sing
great
persia
praise
the
trouble
is
with
the
harp
the
country
king
nor
throne
nor
that
an
upstart
wears
the
ring
ahafid
voice
is
gone
what
say
you
smerdis
art
is
marvelous
even
ahasuerus
once
was
king
he
was
a
despot
it
is
true
but
still
a
prince
if
prince
then
why
not
still
a
king
eh
smerdis
more
than
prince
and
less
than
king
why
now
the
sceptre
aye
almost
the
crown
are
worn
by
haman
not
of
noble
birth
but
lowborn
vulgar
raised
by
royal
will
to
first
place
in
a
land
renowned
for
blood
to
first
place
in
a
land
renowned
for
fools
what
that
this
haman
is
a
cunning
fox
the
exile
of
the
virtuous
vashti
was
a
fatal
sin
she
should
have
feasted
with
the
king
i
did
not
hear
old
xerxes
lost
the
finest
houri
in
his
harem
oh
the
royal
fool
the
jewess
esther
but
a
girl
as
beauteous
as
a
lustrous
star
but
innocent
as
dawn
of
day
as
wise
as
snakes
and
innocent
as
doves
what
smerdis
what
you
catch
my
simile
ah
yes
ahafid
yes
aurora
in
the
bath
pool
that
was
fine
your
poetry
like
wine
improves
with
age
go
on
go
on
let
have
another
picture
of
the
dawn
her
beauty
made
her
queen
but
can
not
save
her
life
ahasuerus
will
attend
to
that
ahasuerus
does
not
seem
to
know
a
persian
law
can
not
be
changed
he
knows
that
lawyers
can
be
bribed
what
that
just
thinking
of
the
lustrous
stars
of
dawn
but
mordecai
believes
that
esther
can
control
the
king
and
yet
may
save
the
jews
i
am
more
interested
in
fools
than
jews
the
golden
sceptre
was
extended
when
she
went
into
his
presence
yesterday
last
night
she
banqueted
with
him
but
still
refused
to
name
the
favor
that
she
wished
a
bathrobe
or
some
new
stars
for
her
crown
the
king
does
not
suspect
her
origin
what
will
he
do
when
he
finds
out
the
truth
since
when
has
xerxes
cared
for
truth
what
say
he
add
two
extra
stars
to
esther
crown
beloved
vashti
lives
in
poverty
the
victim
of
a
lewd
and
brutal
whim
and
now
it
seems
that
esther
fate
was
sealed
when
haman
wrote
that
every
jew
must
die
because
the
hebrew
mordecai
refused
obeisance
to
his
pride
watch
esther
smash
that
seal
i
did
not
hear
still
quoting
lines
upon
the
innocence
of
lustrous
stars
and
dawn
of
day
minstrelsy
shall
be
no
more
the
poet
tongue
is
still
the
strings
that
woke
to
deeds
of
yore
no
longer
feel
the
thrill
i
glad
no
more
we
feel
the
thrill
for
i
for
one
have
had
my
fill
eh
smerdis
bathing
in
that
simile
ahafid
and
scene
ii
curtain
rises
disclosing
ahasuerus
esther
haman
and
attendants
at
the
banquet
beloved
esther
my
most
beauteous
queen
this
banquet
does
surpass
in
excellence
even
the
feast
of
yesterday
which
you
prepared
for
haman
and
the
king
your
hand
grows
deft
with
practice
but
my
lord
you
are
a
connoisseur
and
can
but
speak
these
words
in
flattery
o
king
it
was
my
heart
and
not
my
hand
that
flavored
every
dish
that
lies
before
you
esther
now
it
is
your
tongue
that
flatters
still
it
does
rejoice
me
much
to
hear
such
language
from
the
queen
a
connoisseur
say
you
haman
can
you
tell
me
now
what
bay
or
bight
in
all
the
salted
seas
once
held
this
shrimp
up
it
my
lord
i
think
it
must
have
been
the
persian
gulf
ha
ha
haman
why
you
do
not
know
a
wild
goose
from
the
bird
of
paradise
this
crangonoid
is
found
nowhere
except
along
the
red
sea
beach
not
far
from
where
the
hosts
of
pharaoh
were
engulfed
and
lost
suppressed
oh
king
your
tongue
is
most
acute
but
whence
think
you
this
tinct
of
cinnamon
that
makes
the
savor
of
the
dish
for
a
long
i
give
it
up
unless
it
came
from
java
or
ceylon
changing
rapidly
to
deep
my
lord
it
is
not
cinnamon
at
all
but
spice
that
grew
a
thousand
years
ago
in
hills
beyond
the
jordon
haman
can
you
tell
the
flavor
of
the
grape
that
fills
your
goblet
oh
i
think
it
must
have
grown
in
islands
of
the
blue
aegean
sea
to
the
my
lord
it
is
the
selfsame
cup
they
drank
from
sacred
vessels
at
belshazzar
feast
that
night
in
babylon
what
means
the
queen
this
wine
is
not
that
old
and
yet
is
not
excelled
at
banquets
of
the
gods
effect
of
nor
kings
this
is
a
joyous
night
oh
queen
your
wit
has
filled
my
cup
with
wine
of
happiness
what
think
you
haman
should
be
done
to
him
the
king
delighteth
most
to
honor
now
bring
forth
the
robe
o
king
your
majesty
does
wear
and
place
it
on
the
one

grace
does
most
delight
to
honor
xerxes
set
this
man
upon
your
royal
horse
and
place
your
majesty
own
jeweled
crown
upon
his
head
and
let
him
be
proclaimed
throughout
the
public
streets
so
let
it
then
be
done
to
mordecai
the
jew
beside
the
palace
gate
what
words
are
these
you
can
not
mean
the
jew
the
jew
i
mean
last
night
i
could
not
sleep
and
so
i
had
the
book
of
records
read
the
chronicles
wherein
i
learned
that
this
same
mordecai
the
jew
had
saved
ahasuerus
life
when
teresh
and
another
chamberlain
had
sought
to
lay
the
hand
of
violence
upon
your
king
let
nothing
fail
of
all
that
you
have
spoken
should
be
done
to
him
the
king
delighteth
now
to
honor
most
and
esther
tell
ahasuerus
now
your
dearest
wish
on
yesterday
i
begged
to
know
the
favor
you
did
most
desire
and
now
it
shall
be
granted
unto

to
half
my
kingdom

shall
be
performed

my
petition

my
people

at
my
request
for
we
are
sold
to
be
destroyed
to
perish
and
be
slain

o
where

i
some

find

nightfall
see
him
lose

singing
was
the
pride
of
persia
rule
now
that
age
has
come
upon
him
hear
him
braying
like
a
mule
still
singing
like
a
nightingale
say
you
i
did
the
kind
that
crops
the

haman
hanged
upon
the
scaffold
that
he
built
for
mordecai
the
jew
now
wears
the
signet
ring
that
sealed
his
nation
life
his
nation
life
but
how
can
he
explain
the
slaughter
of
the
persian
hosts
now
if
he
would
i
think
he
could
and
if
he
should
he
thus
explain
the
hosts
were
slain
because
my
brain
was
not
insane
so
i
raised
cain
obtained
the
reign
of
this
campaign
and
still
remain
though
they
were
slain
i
think
i
must
be
growing
deaf
you
rhymed
i
only
spoke
a
little
joke
if
i
could
sing
i
say
the
ring
and
not
the
king
explains
the
thing
but
does
the
god
of
abraham
inspire
revenge
the
worshippers
of
moloch
would
have
shrunk
from
such
a
day
of
death
i
marvel
that
queen
esther
did
not
intervene
she
rules
the
king
but
wherefore
did
i
say
the
king
i
think
it
must
have
been
to
rhyme
with
ring
darius
son
a
spineless
debauchee
the

the
purple
robe
enfolds
and
eke
the
royal
gown
for

holds
and
esther
wears

ahafid
said
he
could
sing
ahasuerus
praise
and
that
his
harp
had
lost
the
tone
it
had
in
other
days
but
though
the
jews
are
on
the
throne
and
xerxes
maudlin
full
ahafid
once
more
tunes
his
lyre
and
bellows
like
a
bull
look
out
here
comes
the
jew
a
cloud
upon
his
brow
the
weight
of
empires
on
his
brain
what
matters
does
he
now
revolve
i
fear
the
day
of
adar
troubles
mordecai
we
stand
aside
and
hear
the
premier
mordecai
meditatively
followed
by
zeresh
who
is
unseen
by
him
at
the
name
of
haman
perish
from
the
earth
the
seed
of
abraham
be
multiplied
until
they
are
as
numberless
as
sands
upon
ocean
shore
this
was
my
prayer
i
learned
it
at
my
mother
knee
was
i
not
justified
as
a
hebrew
the
holy
scripture
saith
vengeance
belongs
to
god
but
was
i
not
his
instrument
jehovah
wrought
through
me
his
will
not
mine
was
done
and
yet
his
will
was
yours
the
wicked
haman
would
have
slain
even
the
queen
herself
and
every
jew
that
lives
within
the
hundred
provinces
of
xerxes
weak
and
vacillating
rule
thy
action
was
no
more
than
not
of
mordecai
alone
but
of
my
blood
of
esther
and
the
sons
of
jacob
exiled
and
defenseless
else
the
god
of
abraham
may
chasten
but
he
keeps
his
promises
nor
will
forsake
rameses
sat
upon
his
haughty
throne
and
knew
not
joseph
for
my
people
were
oppressed
with
bitter
bondage
and
their
lives
made
hard
in
mortar
and
in
brick
but
still
they
grew
in
numbers
and
increased
and
waxed
exceeding
mighty
till
the
land
was
filled
with
them
and
then
the
king
was
sore
afraid
and
wroth
because
the
jews
had
never
bent
the
knee
at
egypt
shrines
he
could
enslave
but
not
corrupt
the
children
of
the
true
and
living
god
and
then
he
called
the
hebrew
midwives
and
commanded
them
to
slay
thereafter
every
son
that
might
be
born
to
jacob
sacred
blood
god
kept
his
covenant
with
abraham
and
raised
up
moses
the
deliverer
and
when
the
plagues
had
failed
to
soften
pharaoh
heart
the
lord
smote
every
firstborn
in
the
land
of
egypt
save
where
hyssop
mixed
with
blood
was
sprinkled
on
the
lintel
of
the
door
and
on
the
two
side
posts
as
moses
had
directed
saviour
of
his
people
son
of
amram
and
of
jochebed
obscure
levites
found
in
an
ark
of
bulrushes
afloat
among
the
flags
near
by
the
spot
where
pharaoh
daughter
bathed
and
yet
and
yet
was
moses
not
selected
by
the
lord
to
lead
the
israelites
into
the
land
of
promise
in
and
did
he
not
talk
with
god
upon
the
mount
of
sinai
when
smoke
enveloped
all
the
peak
and
even
priests
were
not
allowed
upon
that
holy
ground
was
i
more
lowly
than
was
amram
child
yet
god
exalted
him
until
the
throne
of
egypt
was
within
his
grasp
though
i
like
jesse
son
was
once
a
shepherd
lad
i
rule
ten
million
souls
now
moses
was
a
vessel
of
the
lord
when
death
passed
over
every
hebrew
home
but
slew
the
firstborn
where
no
blood
was
found
was
this
revenge
not
moses
hand
but
was
red
the
servant
must
obey
his
lord
i
did
not
plot
the
persians
death
the
plan
of
god
was
in
it
all
else
why
were
you
made
premier
at
the
moment
when
the
jews
faced
death
in
every
province
of
the
king
it
was
my
hand
that
stopped
the
massacre
but
god
avenged
the
awful
wrong
and
esther
how
is
it
with
her
you
made
her
queen
she
was
a
humble
hebrew
girl
unknown
and
friendless
but
for
mordecai
she
should
be
grateful
for
the
crown
i
gave
but
hatach
says
her
cheeks
are
often
wet
with
tears
it
may
be
that
she
weeps
for
him
who
won
her
girlish
heart
before
we
came
to
shushan
or
had
ever
seen
the
king
and
yet
that
can
not
be
the
shepherd
crook
is
not
the
golden
sceptre
of
a
king
i
have
no
doubt
that
she
has
long
since
ceased
to
think
of
youthful
dreams
she
rules
the
king
and
what
more
does
a
woman
want
i
did
not
hope
to
make
her
understand
at
once
my
reasons
were
too
subtle
for
her
heart
and
so
i
kept
my
counsel
for
i
knew
no
girl
would
ever
sacrifice
her
love
to
save
the
remnant
of
a
nation
life
and
why
might
even
esther
not
forget
when
once
she
felt
the
spell
of
royal
power
the
tinsel
show
and
glamour
of
the
court
no
woman
lives
that
would
not
be
a
queen
i
knew
ahasuerus
was
a
brute
but
what
of
that
through
esther
i
have
saved
a
half
a
million
souls
through
esther
you
have
slain
a
million
souls
when
jepthah
vowed
a
vow
unto
the
lord
he
kept
his
pledge
and
slew
the
only
daughter
of
his
flesh
for
a
burnt
offering
unto
god
because
the
ammonites
his
enemy
had
been
delivered
to
the
hands
of
israel
now
esther
was
my
only
child
little
you
have
not
sacrificed
but
elevated
her
although
she
does
not
understand
your
heart
she
can
but
bless
her
uncle
mordecai
but
why
should
esther
weep
she
risked
her
life
at
my
behest
but
did
she
not
obtain
great
favor
with
the
king
and
esther
life
was
forfeit
then
through
haman
wicked
hate
i
wear
the
royal
robe
of
blue
and
white
does
esther
think
because
her
vanity
is
flattered
by
the
jewels
of
a
queen
that
mordecai
is
moved
by
pomp
and
show
is
not
the
kingly
trappings
but
the
seal
not
sceptre
merely
but
the
signet
ring
not
rank
but
rule
that
mordecai
would
have
i
can
not
understand
her
tears
no
more
than
she
knows
why
i
wear
the
crown
but
i
am
justified
jehovah
wrought
through
me
into
jehovah
wrought
through
him
hell
wrought
through
him
i
marvel
that
his
tongue
is
not
consumed
by
blasted
lies
wait
till
he
feels
the
flame
that
rages
in
my
heart
hell
may
not
burn
a
jew
but
even
he
can
not
withstand
the
simoon
of
a
fiery
dragon
breath
but
zeresh
was
the
jew
not
justified
justified
gratified
satisfied
parshandatha
justified
in
jepthah
gratified
that
he
is
like
the
meek
and
lowly
son
of
amram
satisfied
that
now
the
crown
of
persia
presses
only
hebrew
brows
you
do
forget
my
lord
darius
son
you
can
not
think
the
blood
of
jacob
flows
through
xerxes
veins
does
he
not
wear
the
crown
ahasuerus
wears
a
pigeon
heart
the
persian
robe
a
jewish
gabardine
the
crown
a
hebrew
priest
phylactery
but
did
you
say
forget
have
you
been
so
long
with
me
dear
and
doubt
my
memory
forget
ahasuerus
did
you
say
that
minion
of
a
jewish
girl
who
sealed
the
death
of
haman
and
his
sons
his
face
is
seared
upon
my
heart
his
image
burnt
into
my
brain
i
tell
you
xerxes
is
no
longer
king
but
is
not
esther
queen
parshandatha
why
do
you
taunt
me
thus
have
i
not
proved
your
friend
do
i
deserve
your
mockery
i
do
but
speak
to
sting
you
to
revenge
let
fly
your
venom
then
the
persian
empire
is
in
arms
the
king
does
hold
a
great
carouse
the
jew
will
sit
in
state
beside
the
profligate
this
blade
i
have
prepared
against
that
hour
the
queen
i
understand
will
be
a
blaze
of
gems
ahasuerus
boasts
this
night
would
all
but
wreck
a
petty
kingdom
he
should
never
live
to
see
the
rising
sun
the
rising
sun
my
dear
he
shall
not
see
the
pleiades
again
and
they
are
up
at
nine
when
cornet
and
the
trumpet
bruit
the
entry
of
the
queen
a
hundred
blades
like
this
shall
be
unsheathed
parshandatha
you
know
whose
blood
my
blade
shall
drink
my
hour
has
come
ah
esther
you
shall
sup
once
more
with
haman
and
your
drunken
lord
while
zeresh
keeps
her
lonely
watch
beneath
the
silent
glittering
stars
come
on
zeresh
and
scene
ii
place
outer
hall
to
throne
room
curtain
back
time
the
following
evening
vashti
and
esther
from
opposite
sides
of
the
ah
here
already
vashti
at
my
poor
request
who
dared
defy
a
despot
command
to
come
before
him
and
his
lords
your
beauty
radiant
and
spotless
grows
each
hour
of
exiled
life
more
potent
still
than
when
it
hurled
an
oriental
crown
with
all
its
flashing
jewels
in
the
face
of
brutal
xerxes
rather
than
unveil
unto
a
drunken
court
of
lustful
eyes
uncrowned
deposed
you
are
yet
thrice
a
queen
the
sting
the
sting
of
your
envenomed
words
forgive
me
dear
i
do
not
mock
your
fate
no
word
of
mine
is
spoke
in
scorn
i
would
exchange
the
royal
robe
and
crown
i
wear
for
just
one
hour
of
virtuous
freedom
that
belongs
to
you
i
can
not
understand
i
know
is
my
misfortune
and
i
called
you
to
the
palace
that
i
might
explain
yet
every
word
seems
cruel
mockery
i
do
not
blame
you
that
your
cheek
as
chaste
as
lilies
blushes
at
my
seeming
shame
yet
vashti
can
you
not
believe
i
need
your
sympathy
i
crave
your
high
respect
you
must
an
explanation
well
did
you
not
sacrifice
a
queenship
for
the
gem
that
every
woman
holds
above
a
throne
how
can
we
estimate
your
loss
the
pomp
that
follows
majesty
the
crooking
knee
ten
thousand
minions
at
your
beck
and
call
a
thousand
sycophantic
fawning
lords
a
hundred
gleaming
jeweled
chandeliers
the
radiance
and
rich
magnificence
of
court
long
hours
of
revel
and
of
wine
and
then
above
the
splendor
and
the
show
god
finger
writing
on
the
wall
is
this
the
precious
price
that
you
have
paid
this
is
the
price
sweet
friend
i
thank
you
yes
your
loss
has
been
my
gain
yet
what
reward
have
i
how
i
do
hate
the
crown
that
you
did
spurn
o
how
i
love
the
pearl
of
greatest
price
god
pardon
my
great
sin
vashti
i
am
a
daughter
of
rebecca
and
the
blood
of
rachel
pulses
in
my
veins
beyond
the
northern
hills
within
a
valley
green
a
shepherd
watches
his
flocks
beside
a
starlit
stream
and
dreams
of
her
who
gave
the
promise
of
her
hand
when
life
was
young
and
all
the
earth
was
pure
and
fair
his
love
was
constant
as
the
northern
star
and
mine
was
like
the
needle
pointing
true
that
day
is
but
a
sad
remembrance
now
i
never
knew
the
ones
who
gave
me
life
my
uncle
mordecai
who
sits
in
state
beside
the
king
instructed
me
in
love
and
knowledge
of
my
people
every
night
as
well
as
every
day
like
daniel
i
was
taught
to
pray
my
window
open
toward
jerusalem
god
softened
cyrus
heart
because
of
daniel
prayer
but
vashti
you
must
know
from
persian
gulf
to
caspian
sea
the
sons
of
jacob
still
in
exile
groan
beneath
a
tyrant
yoke
i
hear
the
wail
of
rachel
weeping
for
her
children
still
i
hear
my
lover
playing
on
his
flute
who
waits
the
coming
of
a
faithless
bride
mordecai
has
stayed
the
hand
of
death
and
you
did
eat
your
heart
to
save
your
blood
you
comprehend
at
last
your
sympathy
o
vashti
i
must
have
if
not
respect
else
can
i
not
return
unto
the
king
there
there
i
thank
you
sister
friend
proud
queen
the
tears
that
glitter
on
your
cheeks
are
worth
a
diadem
of
sparkling
indian
stones
but
weep
no
more
your
hand
for
esther
heart
can
now
endure
since
vashti
understands
the
stars
are
twinkling
in
the
northern
skies
they
shimmer
on
the
stream
beyond
the
hills
the
shepherd
reed
is
wailing
on
the
breeze
the
revels
in
the
palace
now
begin
the
call
has
come
i
must
no
longer
stay
the
daughter
of
a
benjamite
will
lay
her
heart
upon
the
altar
of
her
blood
hear
you
the
crimson
riot
in
my
veins
is
rachel
voice
i
would
that
you
could
know
forgive
me
vashti
for
my
brain
distraught
the
lights
die
out
beyond
the
palace
walls
the
stars
are
hid
i
can
no
longer
hear
the
wailing
flute
return
unto
your
hut
ahasuerus
calls
with
mantling
wine
my
place
is
yonder
by
the
king
i
go
esther
and
ahafid
and
the
last
word
has
been
spoken
the
last
true
song
been
sung
my
country
heart
is
broken
the
poet
harp
unstrung
ahafid
seems
to
harp
upon
his
strings
it
seems
ahasuerus
means
to
drink
the
cup
of
revel
to
its
bitter
lees
the
deeper
in
the
cup
he
goes
the
sweeter
is
the
wine
that
flows
the
closer
to
the
lees
he
thinks
the
purer
is
the
wine
he
drinks
messengers
from
every
province
bring
reports
of
mutterings
and
dangerous
revolt
but
xerxes
heedless
still
declares
this
night
shall
dim
the
glories
of
the
past
the
lower
in
the
lamp
the
oil
the
fewer
are
the
days
of
toil
the
brighter
burns
the
wick
of
life
the
sooner
end
the
days
of
strife
is
not
for
oil
that
xerxes
cares
but
brilliancy
of
flame
that
flares
i
hate
the
hebrews
and
their
jewish
god
i
hate
jehovah
for
his
jealous
love
but
mordecai
refuses
to
attend
the
feast
the
god
of
israel
must
save
us
now
or
persia
perish
utterly
my
hand
will
pen
no
ribald
verse
this
revel
to
adorn
ye
gods
inspire
my
tongue
to
curse
the
day
the
king
was
born
the
more
he
swears
the
less
he
sings
then
welcome
is
this
news
he
brings
for
listening
to
his
song
is
worse
than
hearing
old
ahafid
curse
persia
heart
is
beating
low
thinking
of
the
long
ago
when
the
king
that
wore
the
crown
was
a
prince
of
great
renown
when
her
name
without
a
peer
did
inspire
the
world
with
fear
but
her
sovereign
lust
trails
her
banner
in
the
dust
now
my
life
is
ebbing
fast
dreaming
of
the
glorious
past
feeling
all
the
shame
and
smart
dying
of
a
broken
heart
to
scene
iii
rises
on
ahasuerus
and
his
keeper
of
the
concubines
ahasuerus
drinks
your
health
and
bids
you
bring
immediately
before
the
court
the
serpents
of
the
orient
the
king
would
have
a
night
of
revelry
court
fool
smerdis
dances
out
before
the
what
smerdis
is
the
office
of
a
fool
to
charm
these
serpents
of
the
orient
but
more
to
furnish
brains
for
idiot
kings
now
tell
the
chief
musicians
every
one
to
string
his
harp
with
golden
wire
and
tune
his
finest
persian
reed
to
touch
the
heart
with
joy
the
emperor
of
the
east
the
monarch
of
the
world
from
babylon
to
india
would
show
munificence
of
entertainment
never
seen
within
the
palace
walls
before
you
do
forget
that
night
six
years
ago
the
palace
was
a
blaze
of
light
the
air
was
fragrant
with
the
breath
of
spice
from
off
the
indian
seas
ahasuerus
flushed
with
flattery
and
wine
was
mad
with
passion
smerdis
charm
these
serpents
if
you
will
your
glittering
words
are
meaningless
to
me
carshena
let
the
jewish
esther
come
in
tyrian
robe
in
such
a
gown
as
never
vashti
wore
his
orders
have
not
always
been
obeyed
and
i
would
have
my
queen
adorned
with
gems
that
diamond
cluster
from
beyond
the
ind
which
sparkling
in
her
aureole
of
gold
bedims
the
constellation
of
the
southern
cross
and
makes
the
persian
peasants
mourn
their
loss
i
say
meheuman
this
shall
be
a
night
in
which
ahasuerus
feasts
his
friends
a
banquet
for
the
soul
as
well
as
flesh
a
famished
soul
such
feasting
would
refresh
for
who
does
not
delight
to
look
upon
the
rhythmic
beauty
of
voluptuous
form
heart
a
writhing
snake
can
warm
whose
ear
is
not
enthralled
by
luscious
lute
whose
heart
is
not
inspired
by
festive
song
the
one
bowed
down
by
tyranny
and
wrong
but
why
has
mordecai
delayed
to
come
the
hated
sons
of
haman
are
no
more
that
reprobate
who
would
have
slain
the
queen
herself
to
gratify
his
wounded
pride
has
long
since
festered
in
the
rain
and
sun
no
enemy
remains
alive
who
dares
to

why
mordecai

late
he
sits
once

sackcloth
and
bemoans
his
fate
he
sits
and
dreams
of
hills
and
streams
that
flow
through
pasture
lands
and
fields
he
sees
a
child
of
golden
hair
as
happy
as
the
vibrant
air
and
hears
the
notes
and
pulse
of
song
where
birds
and
sheep
and
shepherds
throng
and
then
he
turns
to
banquet
halls
and
scenes
like
this
in

lords
and

and

the
call
that
comes
from

blow
the

that
seems
to
me
far
brighter
than
the
most
undying
fame
will
you
listen
to
the
story
of
my
early
childhood
days
when
i
read
the
mystic
symbols
in
the
embers
and
the
blaze
of
the
old
fireplace
where
the
backlog
all
aglow
with
its
shifting
scenes
of
fancy
was
a
motion
picture
show
i
know
about
your
natural
gas
your
stoves
and
anthracite
your
phonograph
and
telephone
and
incandescent
light
i
heard
about
the
comforts
and
the
use
of
gasoline
and
the
educative
value
of
a
pathe
the
future
of
the
biplane
and
the
wonders
of
the
press
and
the
blessings
of
the
wireless
when
a
ship
is
in
distress
i
marvel
at
invention
and
its
all
but
magic
art
but
the
things
that
make
for
happiness
concern
the
human
heart
then
why
not
praise
the
tallow
dip
the
dog
irons
and
the
crane
the
kettle
singing
on
the
coals
or
hanging
to
a

the
children
gathered
round
the
hearth
to
hear
of
early
days
the
wildcat
and
the
panther
the
redman
sneaking
ways
the
bravery
of
our
fathers
the
scalping
knife
and
gun
the
courage
of
the
women
folks
i
tell
you
boys
was
fun
we
roasted
sweet
potatoes
and
we
talked
of
marion
men
how
they
routed
all
the
redcoats
or
slew
them
in
the
fen
we
learned
to
love
our
country
and
we
swore
to
tell
the
truth
and
do
no
deed
of
treachery
and
never
act
uncouth
to
guard
the
honor
of
our
name
and
shield
a
virtuous
home
to
read
the
proverbs
and
the
psalms
and
love
the
sacred
tome
i
know
our
home
was
humble
then
rag
carpet
on
the
floor
but
the
stranger
found
a
welcome
there
the
on
the
door
the
and
the
woodpile
and
the
ox
team
in
the
shed
dried
apples
hung
around
the
walls
and
pumpkins
overhead
not
sanitary
i
admit
nor
nor
rich
but
health
and
comfort
and
content
now
tell
me
which
is
which
then
who
can
blame
me
that
i
love
the
good
old
dog
iron
days
when
men
had
hearts
and
character
that
fortune
could
faze
the
years
before
the
slitted
skirts
and
the
turkish
cigarettes
when
women
wove
their
linsey
clothes
instead
of
devilish
nets
when
children
did
the
chores
at
night
nor
ever
heard
of
gym
or
movements
such
as
boy
scouts
yet
kept
in
health
and
trim
we
spent
our
evenings
all
at
home
and
read
and
sang
and
played
or
talked
of
work
and
feats
of
strength
or
what
our
crops
had
made
and
when
we
mentioned
quilting
bees
and
time
we
had
in
mind
our
sweethearts
and
we
sometimes
made
a
rhyme
was
then
i
read
my
future
in
the
embers
and
the
blaze
and
this
is
why
i
celebrate
the
good
old
dog
iron
ways
the
age
electric
the
glory
of
the
good
old
days
has
passed
from

young
folks
bashful
look
now
poor
old
father
limps
behind
his
motorcycle
son
and
sees
the
world
go
whizzing
by
and
knows
his
race
is
run
with
rheumatism
in
his
joints
and
crotchets
in
his
brain
he
finds
that
he
can
hardly
catch
th

train
two
dozen
bottles
of
the

of

would
put
to
flight
the

and
straighten
out
his
pate
but
fogy
folks
do
have
the
faith
nor
interest
in
the
race
they
rather
drive
a
slow

horse
than
go
at
such
a
pace
efficiency
efficiency
in

church
and

where
culture
in
a
dunce
cap
sits
grinning
on
a
stool
and
wondering
where
the
thing
will
end
and
what
the
prize
will
be
when
intellect
all
geared
and
greased
is
mere
machinery

if
he
the

could
spare
from

is
to
find

so

what

turn
your
back

grandmother
days
ah
grandmother
young
was
wrinkled
and
old
when
she
sat
by
the
mantelpiece
and
she
wore
a
cap
with
many
a
fold
of
ribbon
and
lace
as
rich
as
gold
and
worked
in
many
a
crease
and
the
billowy
clouds
of
smoke
that
rolled
from
her
little
stone
pipe
whenever
she
told
of
the
quest
of
the
golden
fleece
wrought
me
to
think
that
grandmother
young
was
shriveled
and
gray
when
homer
sung
of
the
gods
of
ancient
greece
but
all
of
her
marvelous
mythical
lore
was
naught
to
her
magical
power
transforming
a
house
with
a
puncheon
floor
to
a
palace
of
wealth
with
a
golden
door
that
lead
to
a
castle
tower
an
attic
loft
with
a
wonderful
store
of
things
that
we
feared
but
longed
to
explore
our
grandmother
ancient
dower
oh
grandmother
charm
could
change
but
a
base
rude
vessel
of
clay
to
a
haviland
vase
a
weed
to
a
royal
flower
ah
grandmother
home
was
a
temple
of
grace
and
my
worshipped
there
when
around
the
place
like
incense
for
a
mile
of
space
perfumed
the
glorious
air
and
the
song
that
came
from
the
feathered
race
in
the
boughs
of
the
tangled
interlace
of
apple
and
peach
and
pear
enthralled
me
like
the
magic
spell
of
siren
music
when
it
fell
on
old
ulysses
ear
last
summer
i
passed
where
the
palace
once
stood
whose
beauty
my
life
beguiled
it
a
cabin
now
and
the
charmed
wood
of
sugar
and
oak
in
brotherhood
of
walnut
and
hickory
aisled
for
gathering
nuts
and
the
merry
mood
that
only
our
childhood
understood
by
man
has
been
defiled
oh
how
can
i
ever
cease
to
praise
the
fairy
enchantment
of
grandmother
days
when
i
was
a
little
child
just
to
dream
just
to
dream
when
sapphire
skies
are
as
blue
as
maidens
eyes
just
to
dream
when
petals
sow
all
the
earth
with
pink
and
snow
just
to
sit
by
youth
bright
stream
gazing
at
its
crystal
gleam
listening
to
the
wren
and
dove
hearing
only
songs
of
love
to
just
to
dream
of
sabre
flash
when
the
lines
of
battle
clash
see
the
army
put
to
rout
hear
the
world
triumphant
shout
just
to
dream
our
name
supreme
hero
of
a
poet
theme
first
among
the
sons
of
men
master
of
the
sword
or
pen
to
just
to
dream
when
skies
grow
gray
just
to
dream
the
days
away
living
over
childhood
joys
sorrow
that
no
longer
cloys
just
to
muse
of
days
that
seem
like
the
sunlight
golden
beam
summer
nights
and
winter
snow
just
to
dream
of
long
ago
to
amnemon
dear
the
struggle
has
been
hard
and
long
the
i
have
trodden
paved
with
flint
and
shard
and
many
times
my
feet
have
stained
the
flagstones
of
the
street
with
blood
out
yonder
in
the
park
where
life
rich
chalice
sparkles
with
the
wine
of
happiness
and
love
the
world
was
always
dull
and
dark
to
me
hours
i
have
stood
upon
the
beach
and
watched
the
whitecaps
glinting
in
the
sunlight
and
listened
to
the
breakers
booming
on
the
sinuous
shore
while
little
children
clapped
their
hands
and
shouted
out
across
the
waters
and
men
and
women
shook
their
heads
in
silence
and
looked
toward
the
sunset
but
everything
was
always
meaningless
to
me
season
after
season
i
have
watched
the
butterflies
by
millions
come
and
go
and
katydids
each
year
have
sung
the
song
monotonous
and
passed
away
yesterday
the
sun
arose
upon
another
world
gray
skies
have
turned
to
brilliant
blue
the
droning
hum
of
beetles
on
the
breeze
is
like
an
orchestra
of
lovely
music
the
air
is
sweet
and
fresh
as
dewdrops
in
convolvuli
for
two
bright
hours
i
have
strolled
among
the
flowering
shrubbery
near
the
seashore
listening
to
a
song
i
had
not
heard
for
years
and
now
once
more
that
i
am
happy
may
i
not
confess
it
all
i
did
you
wrong
great
wrong
there
was
no
stain
upon
my
life
no
taint
of
blood
within
my
veins
i
came
of
pilgrim
stock
vigorous
and
strong
i
did
not
understand
my
heart
and
knowing
all
the
stress
you
placed
upon
heredity
i
told
a
falsehood
partly
as
a
test
of
love
and
part
for
i
have
suffered
much
but
justly
you
said
my
story
broke
your
heart
and
left
me
where
i
stood
pondering
on
the
sin
i
had
committed
i
had
proved
your
love
but
all
too
late
your
talent
meant
a
brilliant
future
and
i
knew
your
great
ambition
for
years
i
scanned
the
periodicals
where
names
of
most
renown
in
literature
are
found
expecting
always
to
see
my
lover
there
but
always
doomed
to
disappointment
and
yet
i
now
rejoice
that
you
have
not
achieved
great
fame
for
otherwise
i
could
not
write
this
letter
perhaps
best
that
i
should
never
send
it
if
so
it
will
not
find
its
way
to
you
it
may
be
that
you
think
me
dead
or
worse
i
may
have
been
forgotten
this
is
april
the
hillsides
now
are
pink
with
peach
and
apple
bloom
i
will
arrive
in
salt
lake
city
may
the
third
and
be
at
hotel
utah
if
your
heart
through
all
these
years
like
mine
has
hungered
you
will
be
there
too
geraldine
alfred
milner
read
this
letter
while
great
drops
of
perspiration
stood
upon
his
brow
and
trembling
hand
for
seven
winters
he
had
tried
to
bury
in
oblivion
a
face
and
form
that
always
with
the
dogwood
blossoms
came
again
and
each
time
seemed
more
fair
he
had
tried
for
fame
and
failed
but
now
his
book
that
bore
a
pen
name
only
was
selling
daily
by
the
thousands
and
fame
and
fortune
twin
saints
were
building
him
a
shrine
but
did
she
know
of
his
success
and
was
her
conduct
years
before
base
cowardice
had
she
only
told
the
cruel
tale
because
she
knew
his
theory
of
insane
blood
and
hid
her
lack
of
faith
by
taking
refuge
in
his
prejudice
or
was
her
story
true
if
true
or
false
why
had
she
kept
it
back
until
she
knew
red
passion
was
in
his
heart
he
tore
the
letter
into
strips
and
blew
them
fiercely
through
the
air
he
had
suffered
much
himself
but
she
was
not
concerned
what
if
this
letter
had
been
sent
to
open
healing
wounds
to
win
some
wager
with
another
man
to
whom
she
boasted
of
her
power
he
would
not
go
the
air
was
growing
foul
and
stuffy
in
his
suite
of
rooms
and
alfred
threw
the
window
open
the
subway
in
the
distance
rumbled
like
a
gathering
storm
the
palisades
across
the
hudson
now
were
darkling
in
the
falling
shadows
april
thirtieth
at
noon
the
rocky
mountains
looked
like
towers
on
the
chinese
wall
a
hundred
miles
away
would
he
make
connection
at
pueblo
the
gray
monotony
of
grass
and
cacti
had
begun
to
wear
upon
his
nerves
he
longed
to
see
the
royal
gorge
the
steep
and
jagged
heights
of
hills
they
spoke
of
giant
strength
he
needed
for
the
coming
struggle
it
might
be
that
the
air
from
off
eternal
snows
would
cool
the
fever
in
his
brain
may
second
and
yonder
lies
the
great
salt
lake
or
else
a
mirage
on
the
desert
rim
alfred
put
his
pen
upon
the
register
of
hotel
utah
and
read
the
list
of
names
above
she
was
there
geraldine
mahaffy
finally
he
scrawled
a
signature
but
wrote
his
de
the
clerk
thrust
out
his
hand
and
beamed
two
porters
swooped
upon
his
grips
and
soon
the
lobby
hummed
but
alfred
milner
sat
alone
within
his
room
battling
with
emotions
he
could
neither
overcome
nor
understand
he
did
not
know
the
stir
his
name
upon
the
register
had
made
below
or
knew
what
name
he
wrote
at
last
geraldine
mahaffy
this
is
may
the
third
and
i
am
here
thoughtfully
he
creased
the
sheet
and
rang
room
ten
and
answer
please
the
smell
of
brine
was
heavy
on
the
air
that
blew
across
the
lake
the
mountains
to
the
north
were
white
with
snow
above
and
dogwood
petals
on
the
southern
slopes
but
winter
was
forgotten
in
the
plains
for
rivulets
imprisoned
long
in
cataracts
were
leaping
over
waterfalls
and
shouting
like
a
red
bird
in
an
april
cedar
tree
milner
drew
a
long
deep
breath
of
spring
and
walked
into
the
parlor
alfred
geraldine
last
night
i
dreamed
of
cornell
days
and
saw
the
redbuds
blooming
in
the
hills
behind
the
cliffs
of
ithaca
the
ice
in
cascadilla
creek
is
gone
all
night
i
heard
the
roaring
of
the
falls
the
call
of
flickers
sounded
through
the
canyons
of
old
buttermilk
and
peckerwoods
were
beating
reveilles
before
the
sun
was
up
two
blue
birds
built
a
mansion
in
a
dead
oak
trunk
and
called
the
world
to
witness
alfred
geraldine
the
train
for
california
leaves
at
nine
some
hours
out
from
great
salt
lake
the
sand
dunes
stretching
southward
a
waste
of
shrubbery
and
alkali
were
shimmering
in
the
sunshine
like
copper
kettles
on
a
field
of
bronze
dear
alfred
can
you
still
recall
those
afternoons
upon
the
cliffs
above
cayuga
lake
the
little
city
ithaca
was
like
a
jewel
on
the
breast
of
nature
the
lake
a
band
of
silver
stretching
northward
a
hundred
waterfalls
were
visible
from
where
we
used
to
sit
we
often
thought
the
houses
far
to
west
resembled
whited
decks
upon
a
sea
of
emerald
and
wondered
if
our
own
good
ship
would
one
day
cast
its
anchor
in
the
harbor
over
to
the
right
the
cornell
towers
like
mediæval
castles
beetling
the
precipice
were
keeping
silent
watch
above
it
all
the
memory
of
those
blessed
days
alone
has
kept
my
heart
alive
but
geraldine
our
vessel
richly
laden
has
at
last
come
in
nor
ever
will
put
out
to
sea
again
happy
as
those
moments
were
forget
the
past
so
fraught
with
bitterness
to
me
the
desert
now
a
hundred
miles
behind
was
fading
like
a
crescent
sea
beach
in
the
setting
sun
slowly
like
a
giant
serpent
the
sunset
limited
climbed
the
great
sierras
and
started
down
the
western
slope
at
dawn
the
valley
of
the
sacramento
never
bloomed
so
beautiful
before
the
blue
pacific
through
the
haze
was
like
a
canvas
sea
peace
permeated
all
the
earth
the
sun
at
last
was
resting
on
the
ocean
rim
the
turquoise
waters
turned
to
liquid
gold
life
o
my
beloved
is
like
eternal
seas
emerald
in
the
morning
changing
into
opal
amethyst
and
pearl
but
ruby
red
at
last
behold
the
golden
gate
the
seas
beyond
are
all
like
that
morning
in
the
sacramento
petals
dew
and
fragrance
indescribable
plumage
song
and
sunshine
and
over
all
a
california
sky
o
alfred
could
it
only
be
like
this
forever
back
yonder
in
new
york
the
world
is
built
of
brick
and
mortar
and
men
forget
the
handiwork
of
god
how
can
a
poet
hope
to
win
a
name
where
men
are
mad
for
gold
a
name
why
geraldine
i
had
forgot
to
tell
the
story
of
my
fame
the
ecstacy
of
these
three
days
had
blotted
all
earthly
fortune
from
my
memory
i
am
ralph
nixon
author
of
the
ralph
nixon
you
then
who
am
i
a
heavy
tide
of
blood
swept
over
all
the
tracery
of
the
bitter
past
and
in
a
moment
more
she
lay
unconscious
on
a
bed
of
thorny
cactus
the
blew
a
long
loud
blast
and
anchored
in
the
bay
the
woman
opened
wondering
eyes
and
looked
at
milner
why
do
you
call
me
geraldine
my
christian
name
amnemon
we
never
met
before
i
am
major
erskine
wife
we
live
in
pasadena
i
do
not
know
your
name
or
face
nor
how
i
came
to
be
with
you
i
never
saw
this
place
before
but
those
are
california
hills
and
yonder
is
the
great
pacific
the
mystery
of
who
you
are
and
where
i
am
i
can
not
solve
i
only
know
i
wish
to
see
my
home
and
child
little
alfred
never
has
been
left
alone
and
may
be
calling
for
his
mother
now
you
seem
to
be
a
gentleman
please
show
me
to
the
nearest
train
that
goes
to
pasadena
half
in
fright
and
half
in
rage
milner
looked
at
geraldine
and
tried
to
speak
the
mountains
reeled
and
pitched
into
the
sea
a
clevage
in
the
brain
but
whose
this
was
insanity
but
whether
his
or
hers
he
was
unable
to
decide
the
memory
of
the
cornell
days
came
back
the
cliffs
above
the
lake
the
emerald
farms
the
gorges
and
the
waterfalls
and
finally
the
wild
weird
light
that
played
in
iridescent
eyes
that
last
day
on
the
hills
the
story
of
the
tainted
blood
and
what
it
meant
for
future
generations
milner
saw
an
eagle
soaring
high
above
the
park
and
then
he
heard
a
scream
as
though
a
ball
had
pierced
its
heart
the
bird
careened
and
dropped
a
hundred
feet
then
spreading
broad
its
wings
again
shot
upward
to
the
heights
the
train
for
pasadena
speeded
onward
toward
its
destination
a
poet
sat
within
his
room
that
opened
on
the
golden
gate
and
as
the
sun
dropped
into
the
wave
he
wrote
a
requiem
to
hope
that
filled
the
earth
with
fame
a
romance
of
the
cumberland
early
in
the
day
they
passed
the
pinnacle
and
now
the
shadow
of
each
human
form
was
lengthening
backwards
like
lombardy
poplars
fallen
toward
the
east
for
days
the
fairest
maiden
of
the
caravan
had
fevered
whether
from
malaria
and
fatigue
or
more
because
of
one
whom
they
had
left
behind
beyond
the
wooded
mountains
neither
sire
nor
matron
could
agree
but
martha
waters
as
they
laid
her
stretcher
down
and
prepared
the
camp
for
coming
night
declared
unless
they
rested
here
for
days
to
come
her
bones
must
bleach
beside
the
trail
that
led
into
the
dark
and
bloody
ground
and
so
they
waited
for
the
fever
to
abate
but
when
they
thought
her
strong
enough
a
score
of
hardy
pioneers
trudged
down
the
slope
and
launched
canoes
and
and
a
flatboat
in
the
turgid
waters
of
the
cumberland
for
heavy
rains
had
fallen
and
all
the
mountain
streams
were
swollen
in
these
early
days
of
june
but
the
air
was
sweet
with
the
odor
of
wild
honeysuckle
and
the
ivy
with
its
starry
clusters
fringed
the
milky
way
of
elder
bloom
that
filled
each
sheltered
cove
like
constellations
on
a
summer
night
but
now
the
rains
had
ceased
the
air
was
fresh
and
bracing
and
each
glorious
day
all
the
rest
in
beauty
lying
on
her
pallet
on
the
flatboat
the
maiden
breathed
the
fragrant
atmosphere
and
drank
refreshing
whiffs
of
air
that
drove
the
fever
from
her
blood
and
wakened
dreams
of
conquest
in
the
wilderness
toward
which
her
life
was
drifting
rapidly
but
how
could
she
find
heart
for
conquest
why
seek
this
new
land
anyway
where
only
and
forever
to
card
the
wool
and
spin
the
flax
would
be
the
woman
portion
would
ever
in
the
forest
or
beyond
it
in
the
rolling
bluegrass
return
the
vision
that
was
hers
when
only
a
few
brief
months
ago
she
watched
the
sea
gulls
battling
with
the
storm
above
the
waves
of
chesapeake
bay
oh
how
that
day
was
filled
with
meaning
for
her
now
for
as
the
birds
disported
with
the
whirlpools
of
the
air
a
lover
magic
words
were
whispered
in
her
ear
how
that
storm
and
stress
of
life
to
those
that
love
are
little
more
than
winds
to
swallows
of
the
sea
but
now
if
hardship
meant
so
little
why
had
he
remained
behind
when
she
was
forced
to
go
upon
the
long
and
weary
journey
ah
could
it
be
he
cared
no
longer
for
her
love
his
arm
was
strong
then
was
his
heart
not
brave
enough
to
conquer
this
new
world
where
savage
lurked
and
wild
beast
made
the
darkness
dreaded
by
the
most
courageous
soul
for
days
the
fleet
had
drifted
down
the
river
but
now
her
boat
was
anchored
to
a
tree
that
grew
upon
an
island
in
the
cumberland
and
every
man
and
woman
but
the
convalescent
had
gone
ashore
to
stalk
a
deer
or
gather
berries
that
everywhere
were
found
along
the
river
bank
but
martha
waters
lay
upon
her
bed
and
pondered
dreaming
day
dreams
as
she
watched
a
golden
oriole
who
fed
her
young
in
boughs
that
overhung
the
water
and
a
vague
unhappiness
arose
within
her
heart
until
she
tossed
again
in
fever
on
her
couch
she
could
hear
the
roaring
falls
a
mile
below
but
she
thought
the
sounding
cataract
the
sickness
booming
in
her
ears
again
when
she
looked
to
eastward
where
the
mountain
rose
a
thousand
feet
she
saw
a
crown
of
wealth
upon
its
crest
of
which
no
pioneer
yet
had
dreamed
long
she
lay
and
marveled
at
its
beauty
wondering
how
many
ages
would
elapse
before
the
god
of
mammon
would
transport
its
treasures
to
his
marts
beside
the
sea
feverish
she
mused
and
pondered
until
at
last
she
slept
and
then
upon
the
little
island
a
city
rose
as
from
the
ocean
wave
a
city
of
a
thousand
streets
and
every
house
was
made
from
trees
that
grew
upon
the
mountain
many
were
the
palaces
of
wealth
and
beauty
but
those
who
dwelt
therein
she
did
not
recognize
strange
were
their
faces
and
their
manners
haughty
and
while
they
lived
in
luxury
and
ease
others
toiled
at
mill
and
furnace
oh
the
awful
din
of
sledge
and
hammer
beating
in
her
ears
she
woke
a
storm
seemed
just
about
to
burst
in
fury
so
loud
and
terrible
was
the
roaring
but
the
sky
was
clear
it
is
the
booming
of
the
falls
for
her
boat
has
broke
its
moorings
and
now
is
rapidly
drifting
toward
the
cataract
but
four
hundred
yards
away
she
leaped
upon
her
feet
and
screamed
for
help
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
swim
ashore
and
her
frame
could
find
no
strength
with
which
to
steer
the
boat
again
she
saw
the
crown
of
wealth
upon
the
mountain
top
untouched
by
human
hands
but
the
island
city
now
had
faded
from
her
vision
the
mountain
lowered
and
the
world
grew
dark
onward
the
boat
shot
faster
toward
the
roaring
falls
but
look
a
race
is
on
a
birch
canoe
driven
by
as
swift
a
hand
as
ever
gripped
an
oar
is
leaping
the
waves
in
mad
pursuit
with
every
stroke
the
indian
bark
is
gaining
twenty
feet
will
it
reach
the
flatboat
soon
enough
to
save
the
girl
but
who
is
he
that
rides
the
fleet
canoe
no
red
man
ever
had
an
arm
like
that
for
already
he
has
reached
the
speeding
raft
and
with
gigantic
strength
he
steers
it
toward
the
shore
but
no
the
current
is
too
swift
a
moment
more
and
all
will
be
engulfed
within
the
swirling
flood
it
is
too
late
too
late
but
love
is
swifter
than
the
angry
tide
for
like
a
mighty
porpoise
wallowing
in
the
wave
the
valiant
hero
leaps
into
the
stream
and
holding
martha
waters
in
his
strong
right
arm
high
above
the
water
reaches
shore
a
hundred
feet
above
the
deadly
precipice
the
air
was
growing
chilly
even
on
this
summer
night
and
the
emigrants
had
gathered
round
a
crackling
fire
discoursing
of
the
past
and
listening
to
a
modest
tale
of
love
simply
and
unfaltering
james
hunt
related
how
his
heart
had
hungered
back
beside
the
old
potomac
till
he
found
he
could
no
longer
brook
the
passion
that
grew
stronger
as
the
days
of
summer
lengthened
at
last
he
started
and
following
every
night
the
blazing
dogstar
and
resting
through
the
day
till
evening
in
just
three
weeks
he
reached
the
river
where
he
found
the
birch
canoe
that
rode
the
seething
waters
like
a
greyhound
of
the
ocean
then
the
maiden
told
her
vision
of
the
island
city
how
its
palaces
and
mansions
rich
as
gold
and
beautiful
as
crystal
were
constructed
by
her
people
toiling
hundreds
sore
and
weary
of
times
cold
and
hungry
she
had
seen
them
fell
the
forests
hew
and
mill
and
dress
the
lumber
till
the
soil
and
reap
the
harvests
gathering
into
others
garners
stalwart
were
these
men
and
women
pure
of
heart
and
strong
of
muscle
fitted
for
the
tasks
before
them
she
had
seen
her
brothers
laboring
at
the
forge
and
sounding
anvil
sisters
toiling
at
the
wheel
and
distaff
heard
them
at
the
loom
while
flying
shuttle
threaded
warp
with
web
of
beauty
watched
them
till
they
fell
asleep
with
weariness
while
the
sons
of
leisure
feasted
thus
the
maiden
told
her
story
saying
shall
we
undertake
the
journey
plows
are
waiting
in
the
furrows
back
in
maryland
my
people
back
beyond
the
rugged
mountain
there
are
harvests
yet
ungarnered
waiting
for
scythe
and
sickle
calculate
the
cost
and
weigh
it
for
my
vision
is
prophetic
for
my
part
i
choose
this
lover
for
my
guide
and
valiant
leader
he
shall
point
the
way
forever
though
he
take
the
road
that
darkest
then
james
hunt
the
hero
lover
who
had
never
quailed
at
danger
trembling
for
his
happy
passion
rose
and
pointed
toward
the
westward
toward
the
pleiades
descending
deep
behind
the
gloomy
forest
let
us
face
toward
dark
kentucky
fell
its
forests
build
its
roads
and
bridge
its
rivers
give
our
children
to
the
nation
what
though
others
reap
our
harvests
hoard
the
wealth
we
have
created
ours
shall
be
the
nobler
portion
blessed
is
the
one
that
suffers
if
he
spends
himself
for
others
should
the
toiling
millions
falter
though
they
work
for
others
comfort
building
homes
they
can
not
enter
christ
was
born
within
a
manger
may
we
not
produce
a
leader
who
shall
save
our
nation
honor
at
morning
dawning
ere
the
sunrise
gild
the
treetops
let
us
take
the
darkling
pathway
still
the
pleiades
are
circling
still
the
dogstar
glows
in
heaven
but
the
oak
and
pine
and
poplar
all
have
gone
from
off
the
mountain
passed
into
the
marts
of
mammon
by
the
hands
of
toil
and
labor
silent
are
the
loom
and
distaff
in
the
cabin
and
the
cottage
and
the
songs
of
scythe
and
sickle
gathering
in
the
golden
harvests
but
the
pain
of
drudgery
lingers
and
the
heart
still
longs
and
hungers
for
the
fruitage
it
shall
gather
yet
beyond
the
wooded
westward
morning
glories
a
roguish
laugh
a
rustling
vine
i
turn
my
eager
eye
big
drops
of
dew
in
bells
of
blue
and
red
convolvuli
but
nothing
more
i
hold
my
breath
and
strain
my
eager
eye
a
yellow
crown
two
eyes
of
brown
and
pink
convolvuli
the
golden
curls
the
elfish
laugh
rose
cheeks
and
glittering
eye
are
glories
too
like
bells
of
blue
and
red
convolvuli
christmastide
evergreen
and
tinsel
toys
drums
and
dolls
and
bursting
joys
blessed
little

holly

and

tinkling

here
we
go
youth
and

the

chilling

vesper
songs

dear
lord
help
us
to
believe
naught
but
blessings
we
receive
kinship
oh
little
children
ye
who
watch
the
trains
go
by
with
yearning
faces
pressed
against
the
window
panes
you
do
not
know
the
reason
why
your
lingering
image
dims
my
eye
though
i
have
passed
beyond
the
hills
into
the
rolling
plains
dear
little
children
i
once
watched
the
trains
go
by
and
hungered
much
as
when
i
feel
the
silent
stars
and
then
i
saw
the
cold
gray
skies
and
felt
the
warm
tears
in
my
eyes
when
far
beyond
the
distant
hills
i
heard
the
rumbling
cars
precocity
oh
grandfather
what
are
the
stars
stones
on
the
hand
of
god
i
heard
you
call
that
red
one
mars
and
those
three
aaron
rod
and
these
are
great
orion
band
my
child
you
are
too
young
to
understand
oh
grandfather
what
are
the
winds
that
sough
and
moan
and
sigh
does
god
grow
angry
for
men
sins
he
lifts
the
waves
so
high
and
blows
his
breath
sea
and
land
my
boy
you
are
too
young
to
understand
oh
grandfather
what
are
the
clouds
in
yonder
sunset
sky
they
look
to
me
like
winding
shrouds
for
men
about
to
die
dear
grandfather
your
trembling
hand
my
son
you
are
too
young
to
understand
the
secret
old
santa
claus
came
with
his
pack
on
his
back
right
down
the
chimney
flue
his
long
flowing
beard
was
ghostlike
and
weird
but
his
cheeks
had
a
ruddy
hue
and
his
jacket
was
as
red
as
a
woodpecker
head
but
his
breeches
i
think
were
blue
i
heard
a
soft
step
like
a
hoof
on
the
roof
and
i
closed
my
outside
eye
then
i
slept
but
the
other
eye
kept
a
watch
on
the
jolly
old
guy
and
i
caught
him
in
the
act
with
his
bundles
all
unpacked
but
i
not
going
to
tell
not
i
when
santa
comes
again
this
year
with
his
deer
and
a
sled
full
of
toys
for
me
i
do
mean
to
keep
either
eye
from
its
sleep
while
he
climbs
my
christmas
tree
for
i
do
think
it
right
to
the
happy
old
wight
to
spy
on
his
mystery
a
rhymeless
sonnet
sardonic
clothed
in
a
scarlet
shroud
salutes
his
minions
on
the
crumbling
thrones
of
tyranny
and
with
malicious
leer
he
points
a
fleshless
finger
toward
the
fields
of
belgium
no
harvest
since
the
days
of
bonaparte
and
waterloo
hath
filled
my
flagons
with
a
wine
of
such
a
taste
your
crowns
ye
hold
by
rights
divine
indeed
but
has
entered
in
at
lowly
doors
and
sits
by
every
hearthstone
where
they
will
my
in
democracy
has
twined
the
holly
round
columbia
brow
a
crown
of
on
earth
good
will
to
men
i
am
the
and
the
ambition
i
covet
not
the
warrior
flashing
steel
that
drives
the
dreaded
foe
to
headlong
flight
i
envy
not
the
czar
his
ruthless
might
that
grinds
a
state
beneath
an
iron
heel
i
do
not
ask
that
i
may
ever
feel
the
thrill
that
follows
fame
uncertain
light
and
in
the
game
of
life
i
do
not
quite
expect
always
to
hold
a
winning
deal
grant
me
the
power
to
help
my
fellow
man
to
bear
some
ill
that
he
may
not
deserve
give
me
the
heart
that
i
may
never
swerve
in
scorn
of
death
to
do
what
good
i
can
but
most
of
all
let
me
but
light
the
fires
upon
the
altar
of
the
desires
opportunity
i
often
met
her
in
the
days
of
youth
along
the
highway
where
the
world
goes
by
and
sometimes
when
i
caught
her
wistful
eye
i
wondered
that
it
seemed
so
filled
with
ruth
she
was
a
modest
maiden
plain
in
truth
and
unattractive
and
i
thought
now
why
should
one
seek
her
companionship
not
i
at
least
until
i
had
my
fling
forsooth
and
so
i
passed
her
by
and
had
my
day
and
met
a
thousand
whom
i
thought
more
fair
in
tinsel
gowns
beneath
electric
glare
a
thousand
but
they
went
their
primrose
way
now
she
a
queen
and
boasts
a
score
of
sons
her
consort
he
who
shunned
my
charming
ones
holiday
thoughts
the
night
was
like
some
monster
omen
ill
whose
shrieking
froze
the
marrow
of
my
bones
but
day
dawned
calm
though
white
as
polar
zones
the
bluebird
shouting
spring
from
every
hill
the
world
lay
parching
in
the
noonday
grill
and
blades
of
corn
were
twisting
into
cones
but
night
brought
rain
and
now
like
golden
thrones
the
fruited
shocks
deride
october
chill
dear
lord
i
would
that
we
might
live
by
faith
however
cold
and
dark
the
day
may
seem
and
trust
that
every
cloud
is
just
a
wraith
and
every
shadow
but
a
fading
dream
oh
grant
our
eyes
may
see
the
beacon
lights
that
blaze
forever
on
the
peaks
and
heights
the
old
year
and
the
new
old
year
our
journey
has
been
brief
i
sorry
now
to
leave
thee
dying
here
for
thou
hast
borne
my
burdens
with
good
cheer
and
never
murmured
but
assuaged
my
grief
when
buds
of
promise
never
came
to
leaf
when
broken
resolutions
doubt
and
fear
did
mock
at
my
defeat
o
good
gray
year
thy
reassuring
smile
restored
belief
farewell
i
trust
thy
dear
young
child
who
greets
me
at
the
gateway
of
the
dawn
will
deal
as
gently
with
me
and
my
friends
and
lead
our
footsteps
through
the
springtime
mild
summer
lawn
down
autumn
slopes
and
on
to
where
the
path
of
chill
december
ends
fellow
travelers
old
comrade
must
we
separate
sometimes
my
feet
have
faltered
sore
and
tired
and
sometimes
in
the
sloughs
and
quicksands
mired
but
it
has
always
helped
to
hear
you
say
the
road
is
fine
a
little
further
on
your
optimism
and
your
hearty
cheer
have
made
the
journey
pleasant
good
old
year
and
i
in
truth
regret
to
see
you
gone
young
new
year
whom
you
leave
me
as
a
guide
in
doubt
would
have
me
pledge
a
lot
of
things
before
we
start
and
make
some
offerings
to
gods
whose
love
i
fear
will
not
abide
and
yet
i
like
my
new
companion
face
old
year
lend
him
your
wisdom
and
your
grace
james

thou
hast
taught
our

he
loves
the

lash

billows
into

he
loves
the
placid
seas
beneath
the
dome
of
blue
infinitudes
not

but
more
he
loves
to
brood
upon
the
mystic

silent

above
the
silent

and
feel
the
passion
of
infinities
beyond

has
helped
him
find
divinity
in
man
where
only
sin
and
brutal
lusts
have
seemed
to
hedge
him
in
and
taught

pilate
monologue
monologue
of
pilate
to
herod
takes
place
a
few
days
after
the
resurrection
at
the
home
of
pontius
pilate
pilate
and
herod
are
standing
on
the
east
porch
of
the
governor
mansion
in
jerusalem
looking
toward
the
mount
of
olives
the
time
is
just
at
oh
herod
couldst
thou
find
no
fault
in
him
the
man
of
galilee
clearly
he
belonged
within
thy
jurisdiction
didst
thou
fear
to
do
thy
duty
still
i
blame
thee
not
the
mob
was
clamorous
for
blood
i
questioned
him
but
like
a
lamb
before
his
shearers
he
was
dumb
and
answered
me
no
word
was
not
his
silence
proof
of
guilt
but
even
then
i
offered
to
release
him
till
the
rabble
shouted
crucify
this
man
set
free
barabbas
if
thou
wilt
but
we
demand
the
life
of
jesus
whom
they
call
the
oh
dost
thou
think
his
blood
can
be
upon
my
head
i
washed
my
hands
before
the
multitude
and
told
them
i
was
innocent
of
any
crime
toward
him
i
scourged
him
it
is
true
but
that
was
all
they
stripped
him
and
bedecked
him
with
a
robe
of
scarlet
cloth
and
placed
a
crown
of
thorns
upon
his
head
and
then
they
mocked
and
jeered
and
spat
upon
him
hailing
him
as
i
can
not
think
that
this
was
right
but
still
they
say
he
blasphemed
and
deserved
to
die
but
what
is
blasphemy
oh
herod
i
can
never
rid
my
dreams
of
jesus
look
he
turned
his
eyes
upon
me
as
i
dipped
my
fingers
in
the
bowl
a
glance
that
seemed
more
fraught
with
love
and
pity
than
with
hate
he
blessed
the
people
as
he
hung
upon
the
cross
in
agony
of
pain
and
prayed
his
god
to
pardon
them
because
they
knew
not
what
they
did
thou
canst
not
herod
think
this
nazarene
was
more
than
man
it
be
possible
that
he
whom
pilate
scourged
was
indeed
but
could
a
forgive
his
murderers
they
say
the
tomb
is
burst
and
that
his
body
is
no
longer
there
i
might
endure
his
curse
my
pen
has
stabbed
to
death
a
thousand
men
and
never
felt
compunction
for
the
deed
because
i
knew
they
hated
me
but
now
the
voice
that
haunts
my
sleep
asks
only
blessings
on
my
head
they
say
he
wept
for
men
because
of
sin
and
yet
no
guile
was
found
in
him
if
i
could
close
my
eyes
and
see
that
face
no
more
i
might
find
peace
again
three
nights
i
have
not
slept
i
hear
that
judas
hanged
himself
and
now
no
guard
that
watched
before
the
sepulchre
can
anywhere
be
found
had
i
but
set
the
galilean
free
but
did
he
not
insult
my
majesty
he
must
have
known
i
ruled
in
cæsar
stead
what
if
my
wife
was
troubled
in
a
dream
and
suffered
many
things
on
his
account
a
roman
governor
must
be
a
man
they
say
the
temple
veil
was
rent
in
twain
the
sky
was
darkened
and
the
sun
was
hid
he
said
i
had
no
power
to
crucify
except
that
it
be
given
from
above
he
did
not
know
the
strength
of
pilate
arm
is
said
he
cried
my
god
my
god
why
hast
thou
now
forsaken
me
the
earth
did
quake
the
tombs
were
cracked
and
then
the
shrouded
dead
stalked
through
the
fields
and
open
streets
look
look
what
is
yon
robe
of
shining
white
behold
the
man
the
man
of
galilee
with
outstretched
arms
he
stands
on
olivet
the
shadows
purpling
gethsemane
i
hear
him
cry
in
agony
of
soul
how
often
would
i
o
jerusalem
have
gathered
unto
me
thy
children
as
a
hen
her
brood
beneath
her
wing
but
ye
would
not
come
herod
canst
thou
hear
his
voice
it
is
impossible
it
can
not
be
he
must
not
know
that
i
am
pilate
still
he
calls
my
name
i
can
not
dare
not
go
what
would
the
people
think
i
will
be
free
there
is
no
blood
upon
my
hands
see
i
wash
them
clean
and
am
myself
again
oh
now
the
spell
is
gone
though
not
the
king
i
am
governor
of
the
jews
the
virile
spirit
after
reading
a
letter
in
which
the
writer
said
i
covet
for
our
country
a
great
war
one
that
will
stir
our
virile
spirits
and
send
forth
our
youth
to
fight
and
die
for
our
country
what
is
courage
to
face
the
bursting
shell
when
rhythmic
sheets
of
fire
discover
gulfs
of
death
yet
rather
steel
than
daunt
the
heart
when
comrades
fall
beneath
the
knapsack
weight
foot
froze
and
bleeding
on
the
icy
road
to
hear
the
blasts
from
towering
alps
sing
only
martial
airs
that
stir
the
blood
it
is
a
noble
thing
to
die
in
war
to
sacrifice
the
breath
of
life
to
feel
the
pain
of
hunger
and
of
cold
yet
flinch
not
that
one
country
may
be
great
or
free
many
a
generation
yet
unborn
will
bless
the
name
of
valley
forge
and
hold
in
reverence
the
field
of
gettysburg
but
war
is
not
the
only
thing
that
tries
the
bravest
soul
to
live
does
sometimes
take
more
courage
than
to
close
with
death
and
oft
the
coward
shrinks
from
living
when
the
brave
man
scorns
to
die
we
need
no
bugle
note
to
rouse
our
manhood
strength
the
call
to
men
is
clear
and
strong
it
is
not
to
repel
the
hun
the
teuton
or
the
slav
nor
yet
to
drive
the
yellow
peril
from
the
seas
we
must
send
forth
our
men
to
live
not
die
we
need
to
save
not
kill
our
fellow
man
to
smite
the
minotaur
of
sin
and
stop
the
tribute
greater
now
than
all
the
tolls
of
war
the
beast
in
man
is
ravenous
and
must
be
slain
he
feeds
upon
the
fruits
of
toil
and
blights
the
home
with
poverty
he
drags
the
innocent
to
dens
of
shame
to
satisfy
his
brute
carnality
no
fiery
dragon
in
the
days
of
myth
laid
waste
a
land
or
blasted
life
with
breath
more
foul
or
appetite
insatiate
this
is
the
enemy
that
we
must
fight
no
dreadnaughts
now
afloat
no
submarines
no
legions
that
may
ever
bivouac
on
our
shores
no
zeppelins
disgorging
fire
portend
the
dire
disasters
wrought
upon
our
nation
strength
by
avarice
and
lust
the
sword
of
theseus
is
too
dull
a
blade
the
arm
of
beowulf
not
strong
enough
to
battle
with
cupidity
and
sin
we
need
the
breastplate
of
a
righteous
life
our
loins
must
be
girt
about
with
truth
the
heart
protected
by
the
shield
of
faith
and
in
the
right
hand
there
must
ever
be
the
spirit
sword
which
is
the
word
of
god
and
even
clothed
and
weaponed
thus
it
takes
a
heart
as
fearless
as
the
dauntless
to
strike
the
mammon
of
unrighteousness
to
grapple
with
this
grendel
that
invades
the
still
and
ravishes
our
youth
bluebird
bluebird
in
the
cedar
bush
fresh
and
clean
as
the
evergreen
through
a
rift
of
leaves
or
my
eye
deceives
but
silent
hush
he
calls
he
calls
the
first
spring
note
from
a
feathered
throat
my
heart
enthralls
and
my
pulses
leap
as
a
child
from
sleep
on
christmas
morn
at
the
blast

an

etching
an
old
man
sat
before
his
great
log
fire
and
gazed
dreamily
into
the
dying
blaze
his
eyes
were
red
as
though
with
weeping
the
long
thin
locks
of
hair
were
spotless
as
the
snow
silently
mantling
the
earth
that
last
sad
night
of
the
dying
year
four
days
and
nights
he
had
sat
beside
the
bed
of
his
but
now
the
watchers
by
the
bier
in
the
adjoining
room
were
dozing
in
their
chairs
the
cold
night
had
driven
the
mice
from
their
hiding
and
the
loud
tick
of
the
clock
no
longer
frightened
them
as
they
scampered
over
the
hearth
the
man
was
breathing
heavily
although
his
eyes
were
open
and
his
stare
fixed
upon
the
fire
by
a
gnarled
oak
near
the
spring
two
children
played
rebecca
had
dipped
a
dock
leaf
in
the
water
and
now
whisked
it
in
the
sunlight
against
the
trunk
of
the
tree
there
was
a
playhouse
made
of
broken
boughs
the
girl
dolls
were
lying
on
the
green
moss
bed
and
a
little
cracked
slate
lay
upon
the
ground
an
almost
illegible
scrawl
was
written
on
the
slate
two
childish
hands
had
traced
their
names
rupert
rebecca
and
the
words
were
linked
together
by
lines
that
looked
like
twisted
ropes
the
boy
and
girl
sat
down
before
the
playhouse
and
crossed
their
hands
in
imitation
of
the
lines
that
bound
their
names
together
and
then
they
smiled
and
looked
upon
the
dolls
asleep
in
the
fresh
june
a
chunk
broke
and
fell
in
the
ashes
the
blaze
died
into
a
glow
of
coals
in
the
gray
beyond
the
dog
irons
the
old
man
saw
two
figures
sitting
before
an
awning
golden
haired
children
slept
in
a
little
bed
the
man
and
woman
who
sat
beside
the
shelter
were
old
and
bent
their
faces
thin
and
white
they
clasped
their
hands
and
looked
into
each
other
face
and
then
they
turned
and
looked
upon
the
children
a
coal
dropped
into
the
picture
and
the
fitful
fire
died
into
deepening
next
day
the
bore
two
bodies
away
and
lowered
a
single
coffin
into
a
grave
beneath
the
cedar
a
tragedy
in
birdland
a
little
maiden
fresh
from
her
april
morning
bath
sat
on
the
limb
of
a
weeping
willow
preening
her
shining
feathers
and
dreaming
of
a
song
to
which
she
had
listened
on
the
afternoon
of
the
preceding
day
a
wild
joy
was
in
her
heart
and
yet
it
took
all
the
sunshine
and
song
from
a
hundred
other
throats
to
withstand
the
gloom
that
seemed
hovering
just
above
her
she
was
conscious
of
the
threatening
cloud
but
her
heart
beat
furiously
and
hope
thrilled
her
with
an
unwonted
light
and
yet
she
knew
when
she
dared
to
think
at
all
that
it
was
a
hopeless
hope
that
flooded
her
soul
with
love
a
hope
that
must
ere
long
change
to
a
black
despair
she
lifted
her
crested
head
and
looked
toward
the
old
beech
tree
where
her
lover
now
sat
in
melancholy
gloom
why
not
raise
her
voice
and
gladden
his
heart
he
had
been
true
and
faithful
for
many
weeks
and
his
suit
would
long
since
have
won
another
love
why
had
she
thrilled
at
the
alien
voice
of
another
throat
she
had
been
a
foolish
maiden
to
have
entertained
so
wild
a
thought
but
hark
again
the
song
on
the
topmost
spire
of
yonder
gothic
poplar
sits
a
cardinal
fop
in
a
coat
of
matchless
red
and
a
beak
of
shining
ivory
he
lifts
his
sumach
plume
into
the
glinting
sunlight
and
sends
a
cupid
shaft
from
his
beaded
eye
into
the
trembling
breast
of
little
maiden
poor
little
mademoiselle
once
more
the
notes
come
whistling
and
glittering
like
a
shower
of
pearls
through
the
sunshine
oh
my
true
love
is
a
little
mademoiselle
my
bird
gazelle
my
little
gazelle
and
i
love
her
well
fresh
and
sweet
from
her
morning
spray
she
sits
on
the
willow
and
her
crest
is
gay
mademoiselle
my
little
gazelle
i
love
so
well
down
from
his
commanding
height
flashed
the
cardinal
flame
and
perched
on
another
limb
of
the
weeping
willow
and
then
he
strutted
and
pranced
and
capered
and
danced
and
shot
his
fiery
glances
toward
the
modest
little
maiden
whose
heart
was
now
fluttering
beyond
all
control
master
over
on
the
beech
bough
saw
the
terrible
tragedy
that
would
follow
in
the
wake
of
betrayal
and
was
desperate
to
save
this
psyche
to
whom
he
had
often
poured
out
his
soul
in
amorous
vows
swearing
by
all
the
gods
in
birdland
that
there
was
none
other
beside
her
but
like
many
another
lover
of
larger
experience
and
better
advantage
he
forgot
that
the
very
way
to
lose
his
loved
one
was
to
berate
his
rival
and
lifting
his
reed
to
the
upper
register
of
a
clarinet
he
almost
screamed
he
a
liar
he
is
by
the
god
of
all
birds
a
master
of
villainous
art
a
hypocrite
a
varlet
believe
not
his
words
this
dandy
this
fop
deceiver
betrayer
a
coward
seducer
a
murderous
slayer
he
crush
thy
innocent
heart
poor
little
maiden
heard
his
screams
of
anger
and
despair
but
heeded
not
the
warning
she
only
fluttered
over
to
where
the
cardinal
sat
and
threw
herself
under
his
protecting
arm
declaring
her
perfect
faith
in
his
undying
love
the
red
prince
lifted
his
burning
plume
triumphantly
into
the
sunlight
and
shot
a
contemptuous
glance
toward
the
old
beech
tree
master
unable
longer
to
control
himself
darted
like
a
lance
of
blue
steel
at
the
red
coat
but
the
high
churchman
was
a
skilled
fencer
and
stepped
aside
just
in
time
to
send
his
antagonist
with
terrible
momentum
into
the
thorn
tree
beyond
the
willow
where
a
moment
later
he
writhed
and
fluttered
pinioned
through
his
body
by
a
thorn
that
projected
from
the
trunk
of
the
spiny
tree
it
was
a
sight
to
touch
the
heart
of
the
most
abandoned
denizen
of
birdland
but
mademoiselle
who
would
ordinarily
have
wept
at
so
sad
a
fate
of
one
of
her
kind
was
just
now
too
happy
in
the
love
of
her
wooer
to
notice
another
and
unmindful
of
the
ebbing
that
was
fast
turning
her
unfortunate
lover
coat
of
bright
and
shining
blue
to
one
of
dark
and
dull
maroon
she
nestled
close
to
the
ecclesiastic
and
sighed
the
lovelorn
sigh
that
has
come
from
the
maiden
heart
since
the
foundation
of
the
world
the
low
cedar
in
which
madam
now
sat
on
such
a
nest
of
eggs
as
no
had
ever
brooded
over
before
wondering
fearing
doubting
longing
was
only
a
rod
or
so
from
the
spiny
thorn
where
the
dried
body
of
the
fated
lover
still
hung
but
where
now
was
the
supercilious
fop
whose
seductive
vows
of
love
had
won
the
little
maiden
confidence
and
robbed
her
true
and
faithful
lover
of
that
incense
that
belonged
of
right
only
to
him
for
more
than
a
week
she
had
not
seen
him
surely
he
would
return
on
the
morrow
for
he
must
remember
that
soon
the
little
brood
would
need
his
protecting
love
yes
he
would
return
again
to
praise
her
slender
form
and
shining
crest
and
call
her
once
more
his
little
gazelle
but
the
cardinal
came
not
the
brood
had
hatched
and
the
little
birds
were
covered
now
with
tiny
feathers
strange
sight
all
the
in
the
woods
around
had
gathered
to
witness
what
no
mortal
bird
had
ever
seen
before
little
birdling
with
crimson
stains
on
wings
and
breasts
and
the
poor
little
mother
madam
no
longer
mademoiselle
the
bird
gazelle
but
an
outcast
and
disgraced
mother
of
a
mongrel
offspring
left
alone
in
this
hour
of
shame
remembered
now
the
words
of
him
who
had
warned
against
this
sad
hour
but
the
memory
brought
her
only
bitter
grief
and
she
watched
her
brood
in
sorrow
as
they
looked
with
wondering
eyes
at
the
strange
panorama
in
birdland
and
all
the
sat
in
silent
condemnation
of
the
unpardonable
sin
there
was
no
mercy
to
be
found
in
all
the
land
of
birds
for
either
the
forsaken
mother
or
her
little
brood
the
deserted
wife
and
widowed
mother
suddenly
threw
her
wings
over
the
astonished
little
children
as
though
to
wipe
the
stain
of
sin
from
their
innocent
lives
and
as
she
did
so
the
crested
cardinal
with
a
fresh
crimson
bride
flashed
by
and
perched
upon
the
old
beech
limb
and
there
he
sat
in
undisturbed
and
cynical
silence
while
all
the
court
of
high
crimes
and
misdemeanors
praised
his
sacerdotal
coat
and
shining
mitre
the
mother
felt
the
birdlings
stir
beneath
her
wing
and
their
scarlet
stain
suffuse
her
being
she
looked
toward
the
thorn
tree
but
no
word
was
spoken
a
wise
old
owl
that
moped
and
moaned
on
the
limb
of
a
sycamore
tree
that
overhung
the
little
stream
suddenly
lifted
his
voice
and
cried
let
him
who
is
without
stain
of
sin
lift
the
first
note
of
song
against
the
little
but
all
the
woods
were
still
only
the
thorn
tree
swayed
slightly
in
the
breeze
and
then
a
note
floated
out
upon
the
wondering
air
oh
my
little
my
little
bluebell
i
would
i
could
come
to
thee
i
would
find
all
the
food
for
thy
brood
and
thy
bridegroom
i
should
be
that
villainous
fop
on
the
old
beech
limb
and
the
arrogant
wife
that
sits
by
him
have
broken
the
heart
of
my
little
bluebell
the
little
gazelle
the
bird
gazelle
he
loved
so
well
and
they
laugh
in
their
cynical
glee
oh
i
would
heal
thy
deep
chagrin
forgive
thy
life
its
sin
and
thou
shouldst
be
my
beauteous
bride
forever
happy
at
my
side
my
hope
my
joy
my
love
my
pride
if
i
could
only
come
to
thee
if
i
could
only
come
to
thee
again
the
air
was
silent
as
the
tomb
the
little
mother
bird
moved
with
her
frightened
children
toward
the
old
thorn
tree
and
when
she
at
last
stood
beneath
the
sword
upon
which
her
faithful
lover
was
pinioned
behold
the
miracle
that
was
enacted
before
her
wondering
eyes
the
crimson
dyes
that
streaked
the
birdlings
wings
and
breasts
turned
suddenly
to
a
dull
and
dark
maroon
and
not
a
jay
in
all
birdland
but
would
swear
that
her
little
children
now
resembled
in
every
line
and
stain
the
dead
body
of
her
valiant
lover
