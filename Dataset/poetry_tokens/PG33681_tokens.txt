i
thus
only
should
it
come
if
come
it
must
not
with
a
riot
of
flags
or
a
cry
but
with
a
noble
faith
a
conscience
high
and
pure
and
proud
as
heaven
wherein
we
trust
we
who
have
fought
for
peace
have
dared
the
thrust
of
calumny
for
peace
and
watched
her
die
her
scutcheons
rent
from
sky
to
outraged
sky
by
felon
hands
and
trampled
into
the
dust
we
fought
for
peace
and
we
have
seen
the
law
cancelled
not
once
nor
twice
by
felon
hands
but
shattered
again
again
and
yet
again
we
fought
for
peace
now
in
god
name
we
draw
the
sword
not
with
a
riot
of
flags
and
bands
but
silence
and
a
mustering
of
men
ii
they
challenge
truth
an
empire
makes
reply
one
faith
one
flag
one
honour
and
one
might
from
sea
to
sea
from
height
to
height
the
old
word
rings
out
to
conquer
or
to
die
and
we
shall
conquer
though
their
eagles
fly
through
heaven
around
this
ancient
isle
unite
powers
that
were
never
vanquished
in
the
fight
the
unconquerable
powers
that
can
not
lie
but
they
who
challenge
truth
law
justice
all
the
bases
on
which
god
and
man
stand
sure
throughout
all
ages
fools
they
thought
us
torn
so
far
with
discord
that
the
blow
might
fall
unanswered
and
while
all
those
powers
endure
this
is
our
answer
unity
and
scorn
iii
we
trust
not
in
the
multitude
of
an
host
nations
that
greatly
builded
greatly
stand
in
those
dark
hours
the
splendour
of
a
hand
has
moved
behind
the
darkness
till
that
coast
where
hate
and
faction
seemed
to
triumph
most
reveals
itself
a
buckler
and
a
brand
our
work
shining
sea
and
land
but
shaped
to
nobler
ends
than
man
could
boast
it
is
god
answer
though
for
many
a
year
this
land
forgot
the
faith
that
made
her
great
now
as
her
fleets
cast
off
the
north
sea
foam
casting
aside
all
faction
and
all
fear
in
all
the
majesty
of
her
fate

hearken
o
mother
hearken
to
thy
daughter
fain
would
i
tell
thee
what
men
tell
to
me
saying
that
henceforth
no
more
on
any
water
shall
i
be
first
or
great
or
loved
or
free
but
that
these
others
so
the
tale
is
spoken
who
have
not
known
thee
all
these
centuries
by
fire
and
sword
shall
yet
turn
england
broken
back
from
thy
breast
and
beaten
from
thy
seas
me
whom
thou
barest
where
thy
waves
should
guard
me
me
whom
thou
on
thy
milk
of
foam
me
whom
thy
kisses
shaped
what
while
they
marred
me
to
whom
thy
storms
are
sweet
and
ring
of

behold
they
cry
she
is
grown
soft
and
strengthless
all
her
proud
memories
changed
to
fear
and
fret
say
thou
who
hast
watched
through
ages
that
are
lengthless
whom
have
i
feared
and
when
did
i
forget
what
sons
of
mine
have
shunned
thy
whorls
and
races
have
i
not
reared
for
thee
time
and
again
and
bid
go
forth
to
share
thy
fierce
embraces
and
names
that
thou
knowest

hearts
that
thou

caught

and
slew
him
there
at

they
knew
me
then
as
thou
didst
know
me
then
i
cried
peace
and
every
flag
was
furled
but
i
am
old
it
seems
and
they
would
show
me
that
never
more
my
peace
shall
bind
the

wherefore
o

i
standing
thus
before
thee
stretch
forth
my
hands
unto
thy

and
say
when

come
forth
who

run

prowl

the
prayer

the
price
of

now
while
the

shakes
and

in

shocks
how
look

those
cold
and
solitary
stars
on
these
magnificent
cruel
wars
venus
that
brushes
with
her
shining
lips
surely
the
wakeful
edge
of
the
world
and
mocks
with
hers
its
all
ungentle
wantonness
or
the
large
moon
pricked
by
the
spars
of
ships
creeping
and
creeping
in
their
restlessness
the
moon
pouring
strange
light
on
things
more
strange
looks
she
unheedfully
on
seas
and
lands
trembling
with
change
and
fear
of
counterchange
o
not
earth
trembles
but
the
stars
the
stars
the
sky
is
shaken
and
the
cool
air
is
quivering
i
can
not
look
up
to
the
crowded
height
and
see
the
fair
stars
trembling
in
their
light
for
thinking
of
the
starlike
spirits
of
men
crowding
the
earth
and
with
great
passion
quivering
stars
quenched
in
anger
and
hate
stars
sick
with
pity
i
can
not
look
up
to
the
naked
skies
because
a
sorrow
on
dark
midnight
lies
death
on
the
living
world
of
sense
because
on
my
own
land
a
shadow
lies
that
may
not
rise
because
from
bare
grey
hillside
and
rich
city
streams
of
uncomprehending
sadness
pour
thwarting
the
eager
spirit

intelligence
how
look
i

those
cold
and
solitary
stars
on
these
magnificent
cruel
wars
stars
trembled
in

heaven
faint
with
pity
an
hour
to
dawn
i
looked
beside
the
trees
wet
mist
shaped
other
trees
that
branching
rose
covering
the
woods
and
putting
out
the
stars
there
was
no
murmur
on
the
seas
no
wind
blew
only
the
wandering
air
that
grows
with
dawn
then
murmurs
sighs
and
dies
the
mist
climbed
slowly
putting
out
the
stars
and
the
earth
trembled
when
the
stars
were
gone
and
moving
strangely
everywhere
upon
the
trembling
earth
thickened
the
watery
mist
and
for
a
time
the
holy
things
are
veiled
england
wise
thoughts
are
swords
her
quiet
hours
are
trodden
underfoot
like
wayside
flowers
and
every
english
heart
is
england
wholly
in
starless
night
a
serious
passion
streams
the
heaven
with
light
a
common
beating
is
in
the
air
the
heart
of
england
throbbing
everywhere
and
all
her
roads
are
nerves
of
noble
thought
and
all
her
people
brain
is
but
her
brain
and
all
her
history
less
her
shame
is
part
of
her
requickened
consciousness
her
courage
rises
clean
again
her
children
inspiration
is
her
name
her
name
even
in
victory
there
hides
defeat
the
spirit
murdered
though
the
body
survives
except
the
cause
for
which
a
people
strives
burn
with
no
covetous
foul
heat
fights
she
against
herself
who
infamously
draws
the
sword
against
man
secret
spiritual
laws
but
thou
england
because
a
bitter
heel
hath
sought
to
bruise
the
brain
the
sensitive
will
the
conscience
of
the
world
for
this
england
art
risen
and

fight
purely
through
long
profoundest
night
making
their
quarrel
thine
who
are
grieved
like
thee
and
if
to
thee
the
stars
yield
victory
tempering
their
hate
of
the
great
foe
that
hurled
vainly
her
strength
against
the
conscience
of
the
world
though
all
their
dead
be
countless
as
the
stars
and
all
the
living
bitter
as
the
sea
i
looked
again
or
dreamed
i
looked
and
saw
the
stars
again
and
all
their
peace
again
the
moving
mist
had
gone
and
shining
still
the
moon
went
high
and
pale
above
the
hill
not
now
those
lights
were
trembling
in
the
vast
ways
of
the
nervy
heaven
nor
trembled
earth
profound
and
calm
they
gazed
as
the
hours
passed
and
with
less
fear
not
with
less
awe
remembering
england
all
the
blood
and
pain
how
look
i
cried
ye
stern
and
solitary
stars

these
disastrous

last

with

with
miser
coward
mood
has
his
gold
locked
up

has
cast
adrift
his

the

home
hangs
ever
by

thread

often
hungry

her
