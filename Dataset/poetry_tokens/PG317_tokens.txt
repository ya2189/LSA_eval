is
the
middle
watch
of
a
summer
night
the
earth
is
dark
but
the
heavens
are
bright
nought
is
seen
in
the
vault
on
high
but
the
moon
and
the
stars
and
the
cloudless
sky
and
the
flood
which
rolls
its
milky
hue
a
river
of
light
on
the
welkin
blue
the
moon
looks
down
on
old
cronest
she
mellows
the
shades
on
his
shaggy
breast
and
seems
his
huge
gray
form
to
throw
in
a
sliver
cone
on
the
wave
below
his
sides
are
broken
by
spots
of
shade
by
the
walnut
bough
and
the
cedar

through
their
clustering
branches
dark
glimmers
and
dies
the
spark
like
starry
twinkles
that
momently
break
through

the

are
on

flow
a
burnished
length
of
wavy
beam

an
spiral
line

winds
are
whist

the
owl
is
still
the
bat
in
the
shelvy
rock
is
hid
and
nought
is
heard
on
the
lonely
hill
but
the
cricket
chirp
and
the
answer
shrill
of
the
and
the
plaint
of
the
wailing
who
moans
unseen
and
ceaseless
sings

a
note
of

from

thou

train

light

heard
our
sentence

hence

x
the
goblin
marked
his
monarch
well
he
spake
not
but
he
bowed
him
low
then
plucked
a
crimson
and
turned
him
round
in
act
to
go
the
way
is
long
he
can
not
fly
his
soiled
wing
has
lost
its
power
and
he
winds
adown
the
mountain
high
for
many
a
sore
and
weary
hour
through
dreary
beds
of
tangled
fern
through
groves
of
nightshade
dark
and
dern
over
the
grass
and
through
the
brake
where
toils
the
ant
and
sleeps
the
snake
now
the
violet
azure
flush
he
skips
along
in
lightsome
mood
and
now
he
thrids
the
bramble
bush
till
its
points
are
dyed
in
fairy
blood
he
has
leapt
the
bog
he
has
pierced
the
briar
he
has
swum
the
brook
and
waded
the
mire
till
his
spirits
sank
and
his
limbs
grew
weak
and
the
red
waxed
fainter
in
his
cheek
he
had
fallen
to
the
ground
outright
for
rugged
and
dim
was
his
onward
track
but
there
came
a
spotted
toad
in
sight
and
he
laughed
as
he
jumped
upon
her
back
he
bridled
her
mouth
with
a
twist
he
lashed
her
sides
with
an
osier
thong
and
now
through
evening
dewy
mist
with
leap
and
spring
they
bound
along
till
the
mountain
magic
verge
is
past
and
the
beach
of
sand
is
reached
at
last
xi
soft
and
pale
is
the
moony
beam
moveless
still
the
glassy
stream
the
wave
is
clear
the
beach
is
bright
with
snowy
shells
and
sparkling
stones
the
comes
in
ripples
light
in
murmurings
faint
and
distant
moans
and
ever
afar
in
the
silence
deep
is
heard
the
splash
of
the
sturgeon
leap
and
the
bend
of
his
graceful
bow
is
seen
a
glittering
arch
of
silver
sheen
spanning
the
wave
of
burnished
blue
and
dripping
with
gems
of
the
river
dew
xii
the
elfin
cast
a
glance
around
as
he
lighted
down
from
his
courser
toad
then
round
his
breast
his
wings
he
wound
and
close
to
the
river
brink
he
strode
he
sprang
on
a
rock
he
breathed
a
prayer
above
his
head
his
arms
he
threw
then
tossed
a
tiny
curve
in
air
and
headlong
plunged
in
the
waters
blue
xiii
up
sprung
the
spirits
of
the
waves
from
beds
in
their
coral
caves
with
armour
snatched
in
haste
they
speed
their
way
through
the
liquid
waste
some
are
rapidly
borne
along
on
the
mailed
shrimp
or
the
prickly
prong
some
on
the
leeches
glide
some
on
the
stony
ride
some
on
the
back
of
the
lancing
squab
some
on
the
sidelong
and
some
on
the
jellied
quarl
that
flings
at
once
a
thousand
streamy
stings
they
cut
the
wave
with
the
living
oar
and
hurry
on
to
the
moonlight
shore
to
guard
their
realms
and
chase
away
the
footsteps
of
the
invading
fay
xiv
fearlessly
he
skims
along
his
hope
is
high
and
his
limbs
are
strong
he
spreads
his
arms
like
the
swallow
wing
and
throws
his
feet
with
a
fling
his
locks
of
gold
on
the
waters
shine
at
his
breast
the
tiny
rise
his
back
gleams
bright
above
the
brine
and
the
foam
behind
him
lies
but
the
are
gathering
near
to
check
his
course
along
the
tide
their
warriors
come
in
swift
career
and
hem
him
round
on
every
side
on
his
thigh
the
leech
has
fixed
his
hold
the
quarl
long
arms
are
round
him
roll
the
prickly
prong
has
pierced
his
skin
and
the
squab
has
thrown
his
javelin
the
gritty
star
has
rubbed
him
raw
and
the
crab
has
struck
with
his
giant
claw
he
howls
with
rage
and
he
shrieks
with
pain
he
strikes
around
but
his
blows
are
vain
hopeless
is
the
unequal
fight
fairy
nought
is
left
but
flight
xv
he
turned
him
round
and
fled
amain
with
hurry
and
dash
to
the
beach
again
he
twisted
over
from
side
to
side
and
laid
his
cheek
to
the
cleaving
tide
the
strokes
of
his
plunging
arms
are
fleet
and
with
all
his
might
he
flings
his
feet
but
the
are
round
him
still
to
cross
his
path
and
work
him
ill
they
bade
the
wave
before
him
rise
they
flung
the
in
his
eyes
and
they
stunned
his
ears
with
the
scallop
stroke
with
the
porpoise
heave
and
the
croak
oh
but
a
weary
wight
was
he
when
he
reached
the
foot
of
the
tree
gashed
and
wounded
and
stiff
and
sore
he
laid
him
down
on
the
sandy
shore
he
blessed
the
force
of
the
charmed
line
and
he
banned
the
spite
for
he
saw
around
in
the
sweet
moonshine
their
little
wee
faces
above
the
brine
giggling
and
laughing
with
all
their
might
at
the
piteous
hap
of
the
fairy
wight
xvi
soon
he
gathered
the
balsam
dew
from
the
sorrel
leaf
and
the
henbane
bud
over
each
wound
the
balm
he
drew
and
with
cobweb
lint
he
stanched
the
blood
the
mild
west
wind
was
soft
and
low
it
cooled
the
heat
of
his
burning
brow
and
he
felt
new
life
in
his
sinews
shoot
as
he
drank
the
juice
of
the
root
and
now
he
treads
the
fatal
shore
as
fresh
and
vigorous
as
before
xvii
wrapped
in
musing
stands
the
sprite
the
middle
wane
of
night
his
task
is
hard
his
way
is
far
but
he
must
do
his
errand
right
ere
dawning
mounts
her
beamy
car
and
rolls
her
chariot
wheels
of
light
and
vain
are
the
spells
of
he
must
work
with
a
human
hand
xviii
he
cast
a
saddened
look
around
but
he
felt
new
joy
his
bosom
swell
when
glittering
on
the
shadowed
ground
he
saw
a
purple
muscle
shell
thither
he
ran
and
he
bent
him
low
he
heaved
at
the
stern
and
he
heaved
at
the
bow
and
he
pushed
her
over
the
yielding
sand
till
he
came
to
the
verge
of
the
haunted
land
she
was
as
lovely
a
pleasure
boat
as
ever
fairy
had
paddled
in
for
she
glowed
with
purple
paint
without
and
shone
with
silvery
pearl
within
a
sculler
notch
in
the
stern
he
made
an
oar
he
shaped
of
the
bootle
blade
then
spung
to
his
seat
with
a
lightsome
leap
and
launched
afar
on
the
calm
blue
deep
xix
the
imps
of
the
river
yell
and
rave
they
had
no
power
above
the
wave
but
they
heaved
the
billow
before
the
prow
and
they
dashed
the
surge
against
her
side
and
they
struck
her
keel
with
jerk
and
blow
till
the
gunwale
bent
to
the
rocking
tide
she
wimpled
about
in
the
pale
moonbeam
like
a
feather
that
floats
on
a
wind
and
momently
athwart
her
track
the
quarl
upreared
his
island
back
and
the
fluttering
scallop
behind
would
float
and
patter
the
water
about
the
boat
but
he
bailed
her
out
with
his
and
he
kept
her
trimmed
with
a
wary
tread
while
on
every
side
like
lightening
fell
the
heavy
strokes
of
his
xx
onward
still
he
held
his
way
till
he
came
where
the
column
of
moonshine
lay
and
saw
beneath
the
surface
dim
the
sturgeon
slowly
swim
around
him
were
the
goblin
train
but
he
sculled
with
all
his
might
and
main
and
followed
wherever
the
sturgeon
led
till
he
saw
him
upward
point
his
head
then
he
dropped
his
paddle
blade
and
held
his
colen
goblet
up
to
catch
the
drop
in
its
crimson
cup
xxi
with
sweeping
tail
and
quivering
fin
through
the
wave
the
sturgeon
flew
and
like
the
javelin
he
sprung
above
the
waters
blue
instant
as
the
light
he
plunged
him
in
the
deep
again
but
left
an
arch
of
silver
bright
the
rainbow
of
the
moony
main
it
was
a
strange
and
lovely
sight
to
see
the
puny
goblin
there
he
seemed
an
angel
form
of
light
with
azure
wing
and
sunny
hair
throned
on
a
cloud
of
purple
fair
circled
with
blue
and
edged
with
white
and
sitting
at
the
fall
of
even
beneath
the
bow
of
summer
heaven
xxii
a
moment
and
its
lustre
fell
but
ere
it
met
the
billow
blue
he
caught
within
his
crimson
bell
a
droplet
of
its
sparkling
dew
joy
to
thee
fay
thy
task
is
done
thy
wings
are
pure
for
the
gem
is
won
cheerly
ply
thy
dripping
oar
and
haste
away
to
the
elfin
shore
xxiii
he
turns
and
lo
on
either
side
the
ripples
on
his
path
divide
and
the
track
which
his
boat
must
pass
is
smooth
as
a
sheet
of
polished
glass
around
their
limbs
the
lave
with
snowy
arms
half
swelling
out
while
on
the
glossed
and
gleamy
wave
their
ringlets
loosely
float
they
swim
around
with
smile
and
song
they
press
the
bark
with
pearly
hand
and
gently
urge
her
course
along
toward
the
beach
of
speckled
sand
and
as
he
lightly
leapt
to
land
they
bade
adieu
with
nod
and
bow
then
gayly
kissed
each
little
hand
and
dropped

the

there
he
kissed
the
beach
and
breathed
a
prayer
then
spread
his
wings
of
gilded
blue
and
on
to
the
elfin
court
he
flew
as
ever
ye
saw
a
bubble
rise
and
shine
with
a
thousand
changing
dyes
till
lessening
far
through
ether
driven
it
mingles
with
the
hues
of
heaven
as
at
the
glimpse
of
morning
pale
the
spreads
his
silken
sail
and
gleams
with
blendings
soft
and
bright
till
lost
in
the
shades
of
fading
night
so
rose
from

the
lovely
fay
so
vanished

in

away
up

thy
bower

called

twice

he
put
his
acorn
helmet
on
it
was
plumed
of
the
silk
of

down
the
corslet
plate
that
guarded
his
breast
was
once
the
wild
bee
golden
vest
his
cloak
of
a
thousand
mingled
dyes
was
formed
of
the
wings
of
butterflies
his
shield
was
the
shell
of
a
queen
studs
of
gold
on
a
ground
of
green
and
the
quivering
lance
which
he
brandished
bright
was
the
sting
of
a
wasp
he
had
slain
in
fight
swift
he
bestrode
his
steed
he
bared
his
blade
of
the
bent
grass
blue
he
drove
his
spurs
of
the
cockle
seed
and
away
like
a
glance
of
thought
he
flew
to
skim
the
heavens
and
follow
far
the
fiery
trail
of
the
xxvi
the
as
he
shot
in

crept
under

hid
her
there
the
forgot
its
lay
the
prowling
gnat
fled
fast
away
the
fell
mosqueto
checked
his
drone
and
folded
his
wings
till
the
fay
was
gone
and
the
wily
beetle
dropped
his
head
and
fell
on
the
ground
as
if
he
were
dead
they
crouched
them
close
in
the
darksome
shade
they
quaked
all
with
awe
and
fear
for
they
had
felt
the
blade
and
writhed
at
the
prick
of
the
elfin
spear
many
a
time
on
a
summer
night
when
the
sky
was
clear
and
the
moon
was
bright
they
had
been
roused
from
the
haunted
ground
by
the
yelp
and
bay
of
the
fairy
hound
they
had
heard
the
tiny
bugle
horn
they
had
heard
of
twang
of
the
string
when
the
bows
were
tightly
drawn
and
the
through
the
air
was
borne
feathered
with
down
the
wing
and
now
they
deemed
the
courier
ouphe
some
hunter
sprite
of
the
elfin
ground
and
they
watched
till
they
saw
him
mount
the
roof
that
canopies
the
world
around
then
glad
they
left
their
covert
lair
and
freaked
about
in
the
midnight
air
xxvii
up
to
the
vaulted
firmament
his
path
the
courser
bent
and
at
every
gallop
on
the
wind
he
flung
a
glittering
spark
behind
he
flies
like
a
feather
in
the
blast
till
the
first
light
cloud
in
heaven
is
past
but
the
shapes
of
air
have
begun
their
work
and
a
drizzly
mist
is
round
him
cast
he
can
not
see
through
the
mantle
murk
he
shivers
with
cold
but
he
urges
fast
through
storm
and
darkness
sleet
and
shade
he
lashes
his
steed
and
spurs
amain
for
shadowy
hands
have
twitched
the
rein
and
tongues
around
him
played
and
near
him
many
a
fiendish
eye
glared
with
a
fell
malignity
and
yells
of
rage
and
shrieks
of
fear
came
screaming
on
his
startled
ear
xxviii
his
wings
are
wet
around
his
breast
the
plume
hangs
dripping
from
his
crest
his
eyes
are
blur
with
the
lightning
glare
and
his
ears
are
stunned
with
the
thunder
blare
but
he
gave
a
shout
and
his
blade
he
drew
he
thrust
before
and
he
struck
behind
till
he
pierced
their
cloudy
bodies
through
and
gashed
their
shadowy
limbs
of
wind
howling
the
misty
spectres
flew
they
rend
the
air
with
frightful
cries
for
he
has
gained
the
welkin
blue
and
the
land
of
clouds
beneath
him
lies
xxix
up
to
the
cope
careering
swift
in
breathless
motion
fast
fleet
as
the
swallow
cuts
the
drift
or
the
rides
the
blast
the
sapphire
sheet
of
eve
is
shot
the
sphered
moon
is
past
the
earth
but
seems
a
tiny
blot
on
a
sheet
of
azure
cast
o
it
was
sweet
in
the
clear
moonlight
to
tread
the
starry
plain
of
even
to
meet
the
thousand
eyes
of
night
and
feel
the
cooling
breath
of
heaven
but
the
elfin
made
no
stop
or
stay
till
he
came
to
the
bank
of
the
then
he
checked
his
courser
foot
and
watched
for
the
glimpse
of
the
xxx
sudden
along
the
snowy
tide
that
swelled
to
meet
their
footstep
fall
the
sylphs
of
heaven
were
seen
to
glide
attired
in
sunset
crimson
pall
around
the
fay
they
weave
the
dance
they
skip
before
him
on
the
plain
and
one
has
taken
his
lance
and
one
upholds
his
bridle
rein
with
warblings
wild
they
lead
him
on
to
where
through
clouds
of
amber
seen
studded
with
stars
resplendent
shone
the
palace
of
the
sylphid
queen
its
spiral
columns
gleaming
bright
were
streamers
of
the
northern
light
its
curtain
light
and
lovely
flush
was
of
the
morning
rosy
blush
and
the
ceiling
fair
that
rose
aboon
the
white
and
feathery
fleece
of
noon
xxxi
but
oh
how
fair
the
shape
that
lay
beneath
a
rainbow
bending
bright
she
seemed
to
the
entranced
fay
the
loveliest
of
the
forms
of
light
her
mantle
was
the
purple
rolled
at
twilight
in
the
west
afar
tied
with
threads
of
dawning
gold
and
buttoned
with
a
sparkling
star
her
face
was
like
the
lily
roon
that
veils
the
vestal
planet
hue
her
eyes
two
beamlets
from
the
moon
set
floating
in
the
welkin
blue
her
hair
is
like
the
sunny
beam
and
the
diamond
gems
which
round
it
gleam
are
the
pure
drops
of
dewy
even
that
have
left
their
native
heaven
xxxii
she
raised
her
eyes
to
the
wondering
sprite
and
they
leapt
with
smiles
for
well
i
ween
never
before
in
the
bowers
of
light
had
the
form
of
an
earthly
fay
been
seen
long
she
looked
in
his
tiny
face
long
with
his
butterfly
cloak
she
played
she
smoothed
his
wings
of
azure
lace
and
handled
the
tassel
of
his
blade
and
as
he
told
in
accents
low
the
story
of
his
love
and
wo
she
felt
new
pains
in
her
bosom
rise
and
the
started
in
her
eyes
and
sweet
spirit
of
earth
she
cried
no
more
to
your
woodland
height
but
ever
here
with
me
abide
in
the
land
of
everlasting
light
within
the
fleecy
drift
we
lie
we
hang
upon
the
rainbow
rim
and
all
the
jewels
of
the
sky
around
thy
brow
shall
brightly
beam
and
thou
shalt
bathe
thee
in
the
stream
that
rolls
its
whitening
foam
aboon
and
ride
upon
the
lightning
gleam
and
dance
upon
the
orbed
moon
we
sit
within
the
pleiad
ring
we
rest
on
orion
starry
belt
and
i
will
bid
my
sylphs
to
sing
the
song
that
makes
the
melt
their
harps
are
of
the
umber
shade
that
hides
the
blush
of
waking
day
and
every
gleamy
string
is
made
of
silvery
moonshine
lengthened
ray
and
thou
shalt
pillow
on
my
breast
while
heavenly
breathings
float
around
and
with
the
sylphs
of
ether
blest
forget
the
joys
of
fairy
ground
xxxiii
she
was
lovely
and
fair
to
see
and
the
elfin
heart
beat
fitfully
but
lovelier
far
and
still
more
fair
the
earthly
form
imprinted
there
nought
he
saw
in
the
heavens
above
was
half
so
dear
as
his
mortal
love
for
he
thought
upon
her
looks
so
meek
and
he
thought
of
the
light
flush
on
her
cheek
never
again
might
he
bask
and
lie
on
that
sweet
cheek
and
moonlight
eye
but
in
his
dreams
her
form
to
see
to
clasp
her
in
his
reverie
to
think
upon
his
virgin
bride
was
worth
all
heaven
and
earth
beside

cried

sworn
on
the
word
of
a

knight
to
do
my
aright

honour

from

i
may
not
soil
its
snows
again
betide
me
weal
betide
me
wo
its
mandate
must
be
answered
now
her
bosom
heaved
with
many
a
sigh
the
tear
was
in
her
drooping
eye
but
she
led
him
to
the
palace
gate
and
called
the
sylphs
who
hovered
there
and
bade
them
fly
and
bring
him
straight
of
clouds
condensed
a
sable
car
with
charm
and
spell
she
blessed
it
there
from
all
the
fiends
of
upper
air
then
round
him
cast
the
shadowy
shroud
and
tied
his
steed
behind
the
cloud
and
pressed
his
hand
as
she
bade
him
fly
far
to
the
verge
of
the
northern
sky
for
by
its
wane
and
wavering
light
there
was
a
star

fall

after

the
wings
of
the
blast

away
he
speeds
him
fast
and
his
courser
follows
the
cloudy
wain
till
the
fall
like
pattering
rain
the
clouds
roll
backward
as
he
flies
each
flickering
star
behind
him
lies
and
he
has
reached
the
northern
plain
and
backed
his
steed
again
ready
to
follow
in
its
flight
the
streaming
of
the

the
star
is
yet
in
the
vault
of
heaven
but
its
rocks
in

summer
gale

now
is
fitful
and
uneven
and
now
is
deadly
pale
and
now
is
wrapp
in
sulphur
smoke
and
quenched
is
its
rayless
beam
and
now
with
a
rattling
it
bursts
in
flash
and

as
swift
as
the
glance
of
the
arrowy
lance
that
the
flings
from

gallops
along

bellowing
loud

the
sylphid
charm
is
strong

gallops
unhurt
in
the
shower
of
fire
while
the
fly
from
the
blaze
he
watches
each
flake
till
its
sparks
expire
and
rides
in
the
light
of
its
rays

he
drove
his
steed
to
the

caught

along

the

linger

go
the

as
its

meekly

bend
their

a

each

in

a

mass
just
edged
with
silver

from
yon
clear

who
in
her
glassy
face
seems
to
reflect
the
risings
of
the
place

on
her
still
pale
orb
the

may
see
dim

of
shadowy
brown
like
distant

when
the

plays

that
float
amid

in

it
is
an
eve
that
drops
a

the
feelings
to
a
sober
calm
to
bid
wild
passion
fiery
flush
depart
and
smooth
the

the

give
a
tranquil

relief
torn
is
that
heart
and
bitter
are
its
throes
that
can
not
feel
on
such
a
night
repose
and
yet
one
breast
there
is
that
breathes
this
air
an
eye
that
wanders
the
prospect
fair
that
sees
yon
placid
moon
and
the
pure
sky
of
mild
unclouded
blue
and
still
that
eye
is
thrown
in
restless
vacancy
around
or
cast
in
gloomy
trance
on
the
cold
ground
and
still
that
breast
with
maddening
passion
burns
and
hatred
love
and
sorrow
rule
by
turns
a
lovely
figure
and
in
happier
hour
when
pleasure
laugh
abroad
from
hall
and

the
general
eye
had
deem
her
smiling
face
the
brightest
jewel
in
the
courtly
place
so
glossy
is
her
hair
ensabled
wreath
so
glowing
warm
the
eye
that
burns
beneath
with
so
much
graceful
sweetness
of
address
and
such
a
form
of
rounded
slenderness
ah
where
is
he
on
whom
these
beauties
shine
but
deems
a
spotless
soul
inhabits
such
a
shrine
and
yet
a
keen
observer
might
espy
strange
passions
lurking
in
her
deep
black
eye
and
in
the
lines
of
her
fine
lip
a
soul
that
in
its
every
feeling
spurned
control
they
passed
unnoted
who
will
stop
to
trace
a
sullying
spot
on
beauty
sparkling
face
and
no
one
deemed
amid
her
glances
sweet
hers
was
a
bosom
of
impetuous
heat
a
heart
too
wildly
in
its
joys
elate
formed
but
to
madly
love
or
madly
hate
a
spirit
of
strong
throbs
and
steadfast
will
to
doat
detest
to
die
for
or
to
kill
which
like
the
arab
chief
would
fiercely
dare
to
stab
the
heart
she
might
no
longer
share
and
yet
so
tender
if
he
loved
again
would
die
to
save
his
breast
one
moment
pain
but
he
who
cast
his
gaze
upon
her
now
and
read
the
traces
written
on
her
brow
had
scarce
believed
hers
was
that
form
of
light
that
beamed
like
fabled
wonder
on
the
sight
her
raven
hair
hung
down
in
loosen
tress
before
her
wan
cheek
pallid
ghastliness
and
thro
its
thick
locks
showed
the
deadly
white
like
marble
glimpses
of
a
tomb
at
night
in
fixed
and
horrid
musings
now
she
stands
her
eyes
now
bent
to
earth
and
her
cold
hands
prest
to
her
heart
now
wildly
thrown
on
high
they
wander
her
brow
and
now
a
sigh
breaks
deep
and
full
and
more
composedly
she
half
exclaims
no
no
it
can
not
be
he
loves
not
never
loved
not
even
when
he
pressed
my
wedded
hand
i
knew
it
then
and
yet
fool
that
i
was
i
saw
he
strove
in
vain
to
kindle
pity
into
love
but
florence
she
so
loved
a
sister
too
my
earliest
dearest
playmate
one
who
grew
upon
my
very
heart
to
rend
it
so
his
falsehood
i
could
bear
but
hers
ah
no
she
is
not
false
i
feel
she
loves
me
yet
and
if
my
boding
bosom
could
forget
its
wild
imaginings
with
what
sweet
pain
i
clasp
my
florence
to
my
breast
again
with
that
came
many
a
thought
of
days
gone
by
remembered
joys
of
mirthful
infancy
and
youth
gay
frolic
and
the
flow
of
showering
tears
in
childhood
fleeting
wo
and
life
maturer
friendship
and
the
sense
of
open
fearless
confidence
all
these
came
thronging
with
a
tender
call
and
her
own
florence
mingled
with
them
all
and
softened
feelings
rose
amid
her
pain
while
from
her
eyes
the
clouds
melted
in
gentle
rain
a
hectic
pleasure
flushed
her
faded
face
it
fled
and
deeper
paleness
took
its
place
then
a
cold
shudder
thrill
her
and
at
last
her
lip
a
smile
of
bitter
sarcasm
cast
as
if
she
scorned
herself
that
she
could
be
a
moment
lulled
by
that
sweet
sophistry
for
in
that
little
minute
memory
sting
gave
word
and
look
sigh
gesture
every
thing
to
bid
these
dear
delusive
phantoms
fly
and
fix
her
fears
in
dreadful
certainty
it
traced
the
very
progress
of
their
love
from
the
first
meeting
in
the
locust
grove
when
from
the
chase
leon
came
bounding
there
backing
his
courser
with
a
noble
air
his
brown
cheek
flushed
with
healthful
exercise
and
his
warm
spirits
leaping
in
his
eyes
it
told
how
lovely
looked
her
sister
then
to
friends
and
home
just
come
again
how
on
her
cheek
the
tears
of
meeting
lay
that
tear
which
only
feeling
hearts
can
pay
while
the
quick
pleasure
glistened
in
her
eye
like
clouds
and
sunshine
in
an
april
sky
and
then
it
told
as
their
acquaintance
grew
how
close
the
unseen
bonds
of
union
drew
their
souls
together
and
how
pleased
they
were
the
same
blythe
pastimes
and
delights
to
share
how
the
same
chord
in
each
at
once
would
strike
their
taste
their
wishes
and
their
joys
alike
all
this
was
innocent
but
soon
there
came
blushes
and
starts
of
consciousness
and
shame
that
when
she
entered
upon
either
cheek
the
hasty
blood
in
guilty
red
would
speak
of
something
that
should
not
be
known
and
still
sighs
half
suppressed
seemed
struggling
with
the
will
it
told
how
oft
at
eve
was
leon
gone
in
moody
wandering
to
the
wood
alone
and
in
the
night
how
many
a
broken
dream
of
bliss
or
terror
seemed
to
shake
his
frame
how
florence
too
in
long
abstracted
fit
of
musing
for
whole
hours
would
sit
nor
even
the
power
of
music
friend
or
book
could
chase
her
deep
forgetfulness
of
look
and
how
when
questioned
with
an
indrawn
sigh
in
vague
and
phrase
she
made
reply
and
smiled
and
struggled
to
be
gay
and
free
and
then
relapsed
in
dreaming
reverie
how
when
of
leon
she
was
forced
to
speak
unbidden
crimson
mantled
in
her
cheek
and
when
he
entered
how
her
eye
would
swim
and
strive
to
look
on
every
one
but
him
yet
by
unconscious
fascination
led
in
quick
short
glance
each
moment
him
fled
how
he
too
seemed
to
shun
her
speech
and
gaze
and
yet
he
always
lingered
where
she
was
though
nothing
in
his
aspect
or
his
air
told
that
he
knew
she
was
in
presence
there
but
an
appearance
of
constrained
distress
and
a
dull
tongue
of
moveless
silentness
and
a
down
drooping
eye
of
gloom
and
sadness
oh
how
unlike
his
former
face
of
gladness
is
plain
too
plain
and
i
am
lost
she
cried
and
in
that
thought
her
last
good
feeling
died
that
thought
of
hopeless
sorrow
seemed
to
dart
a
thousand
stings
at
once
into
her
heart
but
a
strong
effort
quelled
it
and
she
gave
the
next
to
hatred
vengeance
and
the
grave
her
face
was
calmly
stern
and
but
a
glare
within
her
eyes
there
was
no
feature
there
that
told
what
lashing
fiends
her
inmates
were
within
there
was
no
thought
to
bid
her
swerve
from
her
intent
but
every
strained
nerve
was
settled
and
bent
up
with
terrible
force
to
some
deep
deed
far
far
beyond
remorse
no
glimpse
of
mercy
light
her
purpose
crost
love
nature
pity
in
its
depths
were
lost
or
lent
an
added
fury
to
the
ire
that
seared
her
soul
with
unconsuming
fire
all
that
was
dear
in
the
wide
earth
was
gone
she
loved
but
two
and
these
she
doted
on
with
passionate
ardour
and
the
close
strong
press
of
woman
clinging
tenderness
these
links
were
torn
and
now
she
stood
alone
bereft
of
all
her
husband
sister
gone
ah
who
can
tell
that
has
known
such
fate
what
wild
and
dreadful
strength
it
gives
to
hate
what
had
she
left
revenge
revenge
was
there
he
crushed
remorse
and
wrestled
down
despair
held
his
red
torch
to
memory
page
and
threw
a
bloody
stain
on
every
line
she
drew
she
felt
dark
pleasure
with
her
frenzy
blend
and
hugged
him
to
her
heart
and
called
him
friend
when
sorrowing
clouds
the
face
of
heaven
deform
and
hope
bright
star
sets
darkly
in
the
storm
around
us
ghastly
shapes
and
phantoms
swim
and
all
beyond
is
formless
vague
and
dim
or
life
cold
barren
path
before
us
lies
a
wild
and
weary
waste
of
tears
and
sighs
from
the
lorn
heart
each
sweetening
solace
gone
abandoned
friendless
withered
lost
and
lone
and
when
with
keener
pangs
we
bleed
to
know
that
hands

struck
the
deepest
blow
that
friends

deemed

stretched
the
pall
of
death
pleasure
bier
repaid
our
trusting
faith
with
serpent
guile
cursed
with

and
stabbed
beneath
a
smile
what
then
remains
for
souls
of
tender
mould
one
last
and
silent
refuge
calm
and
cold
a
resting
place
for

no

can
reach

ye
mild
spirits

your
slumber
in
the
quiet
earth
and
soon
the
voice
of

shall
bid
you
rise
to
meet
rewarding
smiles
in
yonder
skies
but
where
for
solace
shall
the
bosom
turn
for
death
too
strong
for
tears
too
proudly
stern
when
shall
the
lulling
dews
of
peace
descend
on
hearts
that
can
not
break
and
will
not
bend
ah
never
never
they
are
doomed
to
feel
pains
that
no
balm
of
heaven
or
earth
can
heal
to
live
in
groans
and
yield
their
parting
breath
without
a
joy
in
life
or
hope
in
death
yet
for
a
while
one
living
hope
remains
that
nerves
each
fibre
and
the
soul
sustains
one
desperate
hope
whose
agonizing
throes
are
bitterer
far
than
all
the
worst
of
woes
a
hope
of
crime
and
horrors
wild
and
strange
as
demon
thoughts
that
hope
is
thine
revenge
was
this
that
gave
oh
ellinor
to
thee
a
strength
to
bear
thy
matchless
misery
though
the
hot
blood
ran
boiling
in
her
brain
and
rolled
a
tide
of
fire
through
every
vein
though
many
a
rushing
voice
of
blighted
bliss
struck
on
her
mental
ears
like
adders
hiss
that
hope
gave
gloomy
fierceness
to
her
eye
dash
down
the
tear
repress
the
unloading
sigh
fixed
her
wan
quivering
lip
and
steeled
her
breast
to
crush
the
hearts
that
robbed
her
own
of
rest
she
wound
her
way
within
a
heavy
shade
of
arching
boughs
in
leaves
arrayed
which
clustering
close
and
thick
shut
out
the
light
and
tinged
with
black
the
shadowy
robe
of
night
save
here
and
there
a
melancholy
spark
of
flickering
moonshine
glimmered
through
the
dark
cheerless
and
dim
as
when
upon
a
pall
through
suffering
tears
the
looks
of
sorrow
fall
but
opening
farther
on
on
either
side
a
wider
space
the
severing
trees
divide
and
longer
gleams
upon
the
pathway
meet
and
the
soft
grass
is
wet
beneath
her
feet
and
now
emerging
from
the
darksome
shade
she
pressed
the
silken
carpet
of
the
glade
beyond
the
green
within
its
western
close
a
little
leafy
arbor
rose
where
the
pale
lustre
of
the
moony
flood
dimm
the
vermillion
woodbine
scarlet
bud
and
glancing
through
the
foliage
fluttering
round
in
tiny
circles
gemm
the
freckled
ground
beside
the
porch
beneath
the
friendly
screen
of
two
tall
trees
a
mossy
bank
was
seen
and
all
around
amid
the
silvery
dew
the
pansy
rear
her
petals
blue
and
gold
cups
and
the
meadow
cowslip
red
upon
the
evening
air
their
odours
shed
unheeded
all
the
grove
deep
gloom
had
been
unseen
the
moonlight
brightness
of
the
green
in
vain
the
stream
blue
burnish
met
her
eye
lovely
its
wave
but
pass
unnoticed
by
the
airs
of
heaven
had
breath
around
her
brow
their
cooling
sighs
she
felt
them
not
but
now
that
lonely
bower
appeared
and
with
a
start
convulsive
shudders
thrill
her
throbbing
heart
for
there
in
days
alas
for
ever
gone
when
love
young
torch
with
beams
of
rapture
shone
when
she
had
felt
her
heart
impassioned
swell
and
almost
deem
her
leon
loved
as
well
there
had
she
sat
beneath
the
evening
skies
felt
his
warm
kiss
and
heard
his
murmur
sighs
hung
on
his
breast
caressing
and
carest
her
husband
smiled
and
ellinor
was
blest
and
when
his
injured
country
rights
to
shield
blazed
his
red
banner
on
the
battle
field
there
had
she
lingered
in
the
shadows
dim
and
sat
till
morning
watch
and
thought
of
him
and
wept
to
think
that
she
might
not
be
there
his
toils
his
dangers
and
his
wounds
to
share
and
when
the
foe
had
bowed
beneath
his
brand
and
to
his
home
he
led
his
conquering
band
there
she
first
caught
his
face
and
sprung
to
smile
and
weep
in
his
embrace
these
scenes
of
bliss
across
her
memory
fled
like
lights
that
haunt
the
chambers
of
the
dead
she
saw
the
bower
and
read
the
image
there
of
joys
that
had
been
and
of
woes
that
were
she
clench
her
hand
in
agony
and
cast
a
glance
of
tears
upon
it
as
she
past
a
look
of
weeping
sorrow
was
the
last
she
check
the
gush
of
feeling
turned
her
face
and
faster
sped
along
her
hurried
pace
no
longer
now
from
leon
lips
were
heard
the
sigh
of
bliss
the
rapture
breathing
word
no
longer
now
upon
his
features
dwelt
the
glance
that
sweetly
thrills
the
looks
that
melt
no
speaking
gaze
of
fond
attachment
told
but
all
was
dull
and
gloomy
sad
and
cold
yet
he
was
kind
or
laboured
to
be
kind
and
strove
to
hide
the
workings
of
his
mind
and
cloak
his
heart
to
soothe
his
wife
distress
under
a
mask
of
tender
gentleness
it
was
in
vain
for
ah
how
light
and
frail
to
love
keen
eye
is
falsehood
gilded
veil
sweet
winning
words
may
for
a
time
beguile
professions
lull
and
oaths
deceive
a
while
but
soon
the
heart
in
vague
suspicion
tost
must
feel
a
void
unfilled
a
something
lost
something
scarce
heeded
and
unprized
till
gone
felt
while
unseen
and
tho
unnoticed
known
a
hidden
witchery
a
nameless
charm
too
fine
for
actions
and
for
words
too
warm
that
passing
all
the
worthless
forms
of
art
eludes
the
sense
and
only
woos
the
heart
a
hallowed
spell
by
fond
affection
wove
the
mute
but
matchless
eloquence
of
love
oh
there
were
times
when
to
my
heart
there
came
all
that
the
soul
can
feel
or
fancy
frame
the
summer
party
in
the
open
air
when
sunny
eyes
and
cordial
hearts
were
there
where
light
came
sparkling
thro
the
greenwood
eaves
like
mirthful
eyes
that
laugh
upon
the
leaves
where
every
bush
and
tree
in
all
the
scene
in
wavings
shake
their
wings
of
green
and
all
the
objects
round
about
dispense
reviving
freshness
to
the
awakened
sense
the
golden
corslet
of
the
humble
bee
the
antic
kid
that
frolics
round
the
lea
or
purple
circling
round
the
place
on
their
light
shards
of
green
an
airy
race
or
squirrel
glancing
from
the
shade
an
arch
black
eye
half
pleas
and
half
afraid
or
bird
quick
darting
through
the
foliage
dim
or
perched
and
twittering
on
the
tendril
slim
or
poised
in
ether
sailing
slowly
on
with
plumes
that
change
and
glisten
in
the
sun
like
rainbows
fading
into
mist
and
then
on
the
bright
cloud
renewed
and
changed
again
or
soaring
upward
while
his
full
sweet
throat
pours
clear
and
strong
a
note
and
sings
in
nature
language
wild
and
free
his
song
of
praise
for
light
and
liberty
and
when
within
with
poetry
and
song
music
and
books
led
the
glad
hours
along
worlds
of
the
visioned
minstrel
tales
of
old
time
of
chivalry
and
love
or
converse
calm
or
sprinkled
round
like
beams
from
gems

light
and
fine
to
wound
with
spirits
sparkling
as
the
morning
sun
light
as
the
dancing

smiles
upon

oft
have
thought
how
sweet
be
to
steal
the
bird
of
eden
art
and
leave
behind
a
trace
of
me
on
every
kind
and
friendly
heart
and
like
the
breeze
in
fragrance
rolled
to
gather
as
i
wander
by
from
every
soul
of
kindred
mould
some
touch
of
cordial
sympathy
is
the
best
charm
in
life
dull
dream
to
feel
that
yet
there
linger
here
bright
eyes
that
look
with
fond
esteem
and
feeling
hearts
that
hold
me

hope
see
through
yon
cloud
that
rolls
in
wrath
one
little
star
benignant
peep
to
light
along
their
trackless
path
the
wanderers
of
the
stormy
deep
and
thus
oh
hope
thy
lovely
form
in
sorrow
gloomy
night
shall
be
the
sun
that
looks
through
cloud
and
storm
upon
a
dark
and
moonless
sea
when
heaven
is
all
serene
and
fair
full
many
a
brighter
gem
we
meet
when
the
tempest
hovers
there
thy
beam
is
most
divinely
sweet
the
rainbow
when
the
sun
declines
like
faithless
friend
will
disappear
thy
light
dear
star
more
brightly
shines
when
all
is
wail
and
weeping
here
and
though
aurora
stealing
beam
may
wake
a
morning
of
delight
only
thy
consoling
beam
will
smile
amid
affliction
night
fragment
tuscara
thou
art
lovely
now
thy
woods
that
frown
in
sullen
strength
like
plumage
on
a
giant
brow
have
bowed
their
massy
pride
at
length
the
rustling
maize
is
green
around
the
sheep
is
in
the
congar
bed
and
clear
the
ploughman
whistlings
sound
where
pealed
mangled
dead
fair
cots
around
thy
breast
are
set
like
pearls
upon
a
coronet
and
in
aluga
vale
below
the
gilded
grain
is
moving
slow
like
yellow
moonlight
on
the
sea
where
waves
are
swelling
peacefully
as
beauty
breast
when
quiet
dreams
come
tranquilly
and
gently
by
when
all
she
loves
and
hopes
for
seems
to
float
in
smiles
before
her
eye
ii
and
hast
thou
lost
the
grandeur
rude
that
made
me
breathless
when
at
first
upon
my
infant
sight
you
burst
the
monarch
of
the
solitude
no
there
is
yet
thy
turret
rock
the
of
the
skies
the
lair
of
indian
gods
who
in
the
shock
of
bursting
thunders
slumbered
there
and
trim
thy
bosom
is
arrayed
in
labour
green
and
glittering
vest
and
yet
thy
forest
locks
of
shade
shake
stormy
on
that
turret
crest
still
hast
thou
left
the
rocks
the
floods
and
nature
is
the
loveliest
then
when
first
amid
her
caves
and
woods
she
feels
the
busy
tread
of
men
when
every
tree
and
bush
and
flower
springs
wildly
in
its
native
grace
ere
art
exerts
her
boasted
power
that
brightened
only
to
deface
iii
yes
thou
art
lovelier
now
than
ever
how
sweet
be
when
all
the
air
in
moonlight
swims
along
thy
river
to
couch
upon
the
grass
and
hear
niagara
everlasting
voice
far
in
the
deep
blue
west
away
that
dreaming
and
poetic
noise
we
mark
not
in
the
glare
of
day
oh
how
unlike
its
when
the
brink
the
tide
is
driven
as
if
the
vast
and
sheeted
sky
in
thunder
fell
from
heaven
iv
were
i
but
there
the
daylight
fled
with
that
smooth
air
the
stream
the
sky
and
lying
on
that
minstrel
bed
of
nature
own
embroidery
with
those
long
tearful
willows
me
that
weeping
fount
that
solemn
light
with
scenes
of
sighing
tales
before
me
and
one
green
maiden
grave
in
sight
how
mournfully
the
strain
would
rise
of
that
true
maid
whose
fate
can
yet
draw
rainy
tears
from
stubborn
eyes
from
lids
that
before
were
wet
she
lies
not
here
but
that
green
grave
is
sacred
from
the
plough
and
flowers
and
wave
amid
the
grass
and
other
showers
than
those
of
heaven
have
fallen
there
to
when
that
eye
of
light
shall
in
darkness
fall
and
thy
bosom
be
shrouded
in
death
cold
pall
when
the
bloom
of
that
rich
red
lip
shall
fade
and
thy
head
on
its
pillow
of
dust
be
laid
oh
then
thy
spirit
shall
see
how
true
are
the
holy
vows
i
have
breathed
to
you
my
form
shall
moulder
thy
grave
beside
and
in
the
blue
heavens
i
seek
my
bride
then
we
tell
as
we
tread
yon
azure
sphere
of
the
woes
we
have
known
while
lingering
here
and
our
spirits
shall
joy
that
their
pilgrimage
they
have
met
in
the
heavens
to
sever
no
more
lines
day
gradual
fades
in
evening
gray
its
last
faint
beam
hath
fled
and
sinks
the
sun
declining
ray
in
ocean
wavy
bed
so
the
loves
and
joys
of
youth
thy
waves
indifference
roll
so
mantles
round
our
days
of
truth
that
of
the
soul
spreads
the
heavens
the
shadowy
night
her
dim
and
shapeless
form
so
human
pleasures
frail
and
light
are
lost
in
passion
storm
so
fades
the
sunshine
of
the
breast
so
passion
dreamings
fall
so
friendship
fervours
sink
to
rest
oblivion
shrouds
them
all
to
eva
a
beam
upon
the
myrtle
fell
from
dewy
evening
purest
sky
like
the
glance
i
love
so
well
dear
eva
from
thy
moonlight
eye
i
looked
around
the
summer
grove
on
every
tree
its
lustre
shone
for
all
had
felt
that
look
of
love
the
silly
myrtle
deemed
its
own
eva
behold
thine
image
there
as
fair
as
false
thy
glances
fall
but
who
the
worthless
smile
would
share
that
sheds
its
light
alike
on
all
to
a
lady
with
a
withered
violet
though
fate
upon
this
faded
flower
his
withering
hand
has
laid
its
odour
breath
defies
his
power
its
sweets
are
undecayed
and
thus
although
thy
warbled
strains
no
longer
wildly
thrill
the
memory
of
the
song
remains
its
soul
is
with
me
still
bronx
i
sat
me
down
upon
a
green
skirting
the
smooth
edge
of
a
gentle
river
whose
waters
seemed
unwillingly
to
glide
like
parting
friends
who
linger
while
they
sever
enforced
to
go
yet
seeming
still
unready
backward
they
wind
their
way
in
many
a
wistful
eddy
gray
my
head
the
willow
ruffled
its
hoary
top
in
the
fresh
breezes
glancing
in
light
like
spray
on
a
green
billow
or
the
fine
which
young
winter
freezes
when
first
his
power
in
infant
pastime
trying
congeals
sad
autumn
tears
on
the
dead
branches
lying
from
rocks
around
hung
the
loose
ivy
dangling
and
in
the
clefts
sumach
of
liveliest
green
bright
the
little
beach
was
spangling
the
sorrel
from
his
gauzy
screen
shone
like
a
fairy
crown
enchased
and
beaded
left
on
some
morn
when
light
flashed
in
their
eyes
unheeded
the
shook
his
wings
around
the
bluefinch
caroll
in
the
still
retreat
the
antic
squirrel
capered
on
the
ground
where
lichens
made
a
carpet
for
his
feet
through
the
transparent
waves
the
ruddy
minkle
shot
up
in
glimmering
sparks
his
red
fin
tiny
twinkle
there
were
dark
cedars
with
loose
mossy
tresses
white
powdered
and
stiff
hollies
flaunting
gaudy
as
rustics
in
their
dresses
blue
pelloret
from
purple
leaves
upslanting
a
modest
gaze
like
eyes
of
a
young
maiden
shining
beneath
dropt
lids
the
evening
of
her
wedding
the
breeze
fresh
springing
from
the
lips
of
morn
kissing
the
leaves
and
sighing
so
to
lose
the
winding
of
the
merry
locust
horn
the
glad
spring
gushing
from
the
rock
bare
bosom
sweet
sights
sweet
sounds
all
sights
all
sounds
excelling
oh
was
a
ravishing
spot
formed
for
a
poet
dwelling
and
did
i
leave
thy
loveliness
to
stand
again
in
the
dull
world
of
earthly
blindness
pained
with
the
pressure
of
unfriendly
hands
sick
of
smooth
looks
agued
with
icy
kindness
left
i
for
this
thy
shades
were
none

to
prison
wandering
thought
and
mar
sweet
solitude
yet
i
will
look
upon
thy
face
again
my
own
romantic
bronx
and
it
will
be
a
face
more
pleasant
than
the
face
of
men
thy
waves
are
old
companions
i
shall
see
a
form
in
each
old
tree
and
hear
a
voice
long
loved
in
thy
wild
minstrelsy
song
is
not
the
beam
of
her
bright
blue
eye
nor
the
smile
of
her
lip
of
rosy
dye
nor
the
dark
brown
wreaths
of
her
glossy
hair
nor
her
changing
cheek
so
rich
and
rare
oh
these
are
the
sweets
of
a
fairy
dream
the
changing
hues
of
an
april
sky
they
fade
like
dew
in
the
morning
beam
or
the
passing
zephyr
odour
sigh
is
a
dearer
spell
that
bids
me
kneel
the
heart
to
love
and
the
soul
to
feel
the
mind
of
light
and
the
spirit
free
and
the
bosom
that
heaves
alone
for
me
oh
these
are
the
sweets
that
kindly
stay
from
youth
gay
morning
to
age
night
when
beauty
rainbow
tints
decay
love
torch
still
burns
with
a
holy
light
soon
will
the
bloom
of
the
fairest
fade
and
love
will
droop
in
the
cheerless
shade
or
if
tears
should
fall
on
his
wing
of
joy
it
will
hasten
the
flight
of
the
laughing
boy
but
oh
the
light
of
the
constant
soul
nor
time
can
darken
nor
sorrow
dim
though
wo
may
weep
in
life
mingled
bowl
love
still
shall
hover
around
its
brim
to
sarah
i
one
happy
year
has
fled
sall
since
you
were
all
my
own
the
leaves
have
felt
the
autumn
blight
the
wintry
storm
has
blown
we
heeded
not
the
cold
blast
nor
the
winter
icy
air
for
we
found
our
climate
in
the
heart
and
it
was
summer
there
ii
the
summer
sun
is
bright
sall
the
skies
are
pure
in
hue
but
clouds
will
sometimes
sadden
them
and
dim
their
lovely
blue
and
clouds
may
come
to
us
sall
but
sure
they
will
not
stay
for
there
a
spell
in
fond
hearts
to
chase
their
gloom
away
iii
in
sickness
and
in
sorrow
thine
eyes
were
on
me
still
and
there
was
comfort
in
each
glance
to
charm
the
sense
of
and
were
they
absent
now
sall
i
seek
my
bed
of
pain
and
bless
each
pang
that
gave
me
back
those
looks
of
love
again
iv
oh
pleasant
is
the
welcome
kiss
when
day
dull
round
is
and
sweet
the
music
of
the
step
that
meets
me
at
the
door
though
worldly
cares
may
visit
us
i
reck
not
when
they
fall
while
i
have
thy
kind
lips
my
sall
to
smile
away
them
all
the
american
flag
i
when
freedom
from
her
mountain
height
unfurled
her
standard
to
the
air
she
tore
the
azure
robe
of
night
and
set
the
stars
of
glory
there
she
mingled
with
its
gorgeous
dyes
the
milky
baldric
of
the
skies
and
striped
its
pure
celestial
white
with
streakings
of
the
morning
light
then
from
his
mansion
in
the
sun
she
called
her
eagle
bearer
down
and
gave
into
his
mighty
hand
the
symbol
of
her
chosen
land
ii
majestic
monarch
of
the
cloud
who
aloft
thy
regal
form
to
hear
the
tempest
trumpings
loud
and
see
the
lightning
lances
driven
when
strive
the
warriors
of
the
storm
and
rolls
the
of
heaven
child
of
the
sun
to
thee
is
given
to
guard
the
banner
of
the
free
to
hover
in
the
sulphur
smoke
to
ward
away
the
battle
stroke
and
bid
its
blendings
shine
afar
like
rainbows
on
the
cloud
of
war
the
harbingers
of
victory
iii
flag
of
the
brave
thy
folds
shall
fly
the
sign
of
hope
and
triumph
high
when
speaks
the
signal
trumpet
tone
and
the
long
line
comes
gleaming
on
ere
yet
the
warm
and
wet
has
dimm
the
glistening
bayonet
each
soldier
eye
shall
brightly
turn
to
where
thy
glories
burn
and
as
his
springing
steps
advance
catch
war
and
vengeance
from
the
glance
and
when
the
loud
heave
in
wild
wreaths
the
battle
shroud
and
gory
sabres
rise
and
fall
like
shoots
of
flame
on
midnight
pall
then
shall
thy
meteor
glances
glow
and
cowering
foes
shall
shrink
beneath
each
gallant
arm
that
strikes
below
that
lovely
messenger
of
death
iv
flag
of
the
seas
on
ocean
wave
thy
stars
shall
glitter
the
brave
when
death
careering
on
the
gale
sweeps
darkly
round
the
bellied
sail
and
frighted
waves
rush
wildly
back
before
the
broadside
reeling
rack
each
dying
wanderer
of
the
sea
shall
look
at
once
to
heaven
and
thee
and
smile
to
see
thy
splendours
fly
in
triumph
his
closing

by
angel
hands

the

have
lit
the

and
all
thy
hues
were
born
in
heaven
for
ever
float
that
standard
sheet
where
breathes
the
