the

oft
have
you
pray
me
when
in
youth
never
to
err
from
paths
of
truth
but
youth
to
vice
is
much
too
prone
and
mine
by
far
too
much
i
own
induced
to
riot
swear
and
game
i
thought
in
vice
a
fame
but
found
the
scenes
of
riot
soon
robb
my
mind
of
joy
and
quiet
the
usual
course
of
rakes
i
ran
the
dupe
of
woman
and
of
man
careless
of

or

my
desk
i
left
the
town
at
folly

in
wisdom
spite
idled
by
day
revell
by
night
but
short
was
the
delusive
scene
and
i
awoke
to
sorrow
keen
debt
press
on
debt
i
could
not
pay
and
found
that
credit
had
its
day
no
friend
to
aid
what
should
i
do
i
made
bad
worse
to
liquor
flew
for
when
my

survey
i
shrunk
as
if
i
seen
my
shade
and
to
drive
terror
from
my

gave

a

i
look
aghast
my
wife
in

the
naked
truth
now
stares
me
in
the
face
and
shows
me
more
than
one
disgrace

while
as
a
culprit
often
stands
the
humbled
bankrupt
lowers
his
view
and
sees
the
law
its
work
pursue
soon
comes
of
all
his
goods
the
sale
which
like
light
straw
before
a
gale
the
puffs
clean
away
and
cries
must
be
sold
this
day
they
are
so
and
i
tell
you
how
at
loss
you
readily
allow
then
comes
the
tedious
humbling
task
to
answer
all
ask
and
those
who
mean
to
act
most
fair
will
at
first
meeting
appear
to
questions

will
answer
true
and
clearly
state
accounts
to

he
need
not
attend
but
if
not
may
perhaps
offend

man
who
then
can
lay
his
hand
upon
his
heart

may
scan
i
honest
though
distressed
man
my
own
just
wants
and
losses
great
have
brought
me
to
this
low
estate
then
comes
the
last
dread
meeting
on
dreadful
to
such
as
will
act
wrong
and
through
dishonesty
or
shame
evasive

who
in
all
things
pry
his
private
foibles
must
out
grievous
exposure
is
no
doubt
and
if
he
found
must
go
to
witness
scenes
of
vice
and
woe
of
liberty
deprived
to
wail
his
faults
and
folly
in
a
gaol
but
should
his
conduct
seem
least
fair
england
blest
laws
will
set
him
clear
not
only
so
but
means
will
give
him
again
to
live

when
is
found
there
fifteen

when
of

he
may
look

yes
be
it
a

pride
that
mercy
in

he
must
await

some

there
however
are

at

may
seem

refuse

then
if
their

four
they
keep
the
bankrupt
in
their
and
although
he
has
all
resign
if
unproved
debts
remain
behind
inhuman
creditors
then
may
his
body
into
prison
lay
where
oft
the
wretch
to
sooth
his
grief
in
dissipation
seeks
relief
sometimes
a
parent
may
prevent
unmeaningly
the

creditors
decline

oh
sir
i
pray
before
you
leave
this
life
extend
forgiveness
to
my
injured
wife
why
cast
her
from
your
presence
say
the
cause
faithful
she
kept
the
strict
connubial
law
the
seven
years
i
pass
with
her
in
love
she
a
faithful
virtuous
wife
did
prove
was
she
too
gay
in
dress
to
please
your
mind
that
you
to
her
so
long
have
been
unkind
did
she
too
much
in
company
appear
she
scarcely
did
that
twice
or
thrice
a
year
i
told
you
say
her
manners
were
too
high
was
you
who
view
her
with
a
scornful
eye
and
that
because
she
little
store
of
wealth
which
still
was
lessen
to
improve
her
health
say
should
the
want
of
wealth
produce
such
strife
when
virtue
only
guided
her
through
life
i
loved
her
though
her
fortune
was
so
scant
her
fond
endearment
made
me
feel
no
want
and
spite
of
all
that
malice
yet
has
done
we
are
though
parted
still
two
hearts
in
one
what
was
it
then
that
canker
thus
your
mind
and
made
you
to
her
many
virtues
blind
why
did
she
ever
sullen
pride
receive
contempt
a
female
heart
must
ever
grieve
world
when
adverse
gales
prevail
arraign
your
conduct
at
your
actions
rail
should
fortune
smile
your
company
they
crave
and
swear
you
may
their
all
command
and
have
but
should
a
change
of
fortune
take
place
their
friendship
gone
and
they
shun
your
face
so
long
as
you
a
guinea
free
can
spend
talk
nonsense
and
drink
hard
you
be
a
friend
they
say
you
clever
generous
and
wise
but
if
you
poor
the
same
will
you
despise
creatures
like
such
too
many
have
i
found
and
sorry
am
so
many
still
abound
fathers
like
other
men
will
change
with
times
and
when
it
nothing
costs
will
wink
at
crimes
but
if
assistance
you
should
ever
crave
their
answer
is
wish
you
in
the
grave
my
worthy
sire
will
part
with
good
advice
but
with
his
guineas
is
extremely
nice
for
me
cares
little
but
too
much
for
store
he
only
grieves
because
it
is
not
more
and
once
when
he
was
bidding
me
adieu
said
was
much
cheaper
to
keep
one
than
two
meaning
to
say
he
grudged
to
keep
my
wife
this
was
the
logic
he
had
learn
in
life
had
nature
gifted
him
with
callous
heart
less
tender
feeling
could
he
impart
but
to
return
to
female
cause
again
why
should
she
from
me
sever
still
remain
the
only
cause
i
have
her
not
in
view
is
the
contempt
she
received
from
you
when
at
your
house
she
such
did
ever
find
was
that
alone
which
hurt
her
peace
of
mind
not
long
ago
she
came
yourself
to
see
but
did
you
ask
her
any
thing
of
me
in
tears
she
told
you
i
was
in
distress
you
with
much
anger
did
such
words
express
tis
half
your
fault
said
you
with
scornful
brow
that
charge
is
false
the
world
and
i
well
know
nor
did
you
to
her
any
time
impart
sweet
consolation
to
assuage
her
heart
but
cheerful
went
abroad
your
friends
to
see
while
home
she
kept
to
brood
on
misery
one
fault
she
did
commit
i
heard
you
say
was
without
leave
quitting
your
house
one
day
but
why
she
did
so
was
to
each
one
plain
who
with
such
treatment
could
with
you
remain
oft
is
the
world
deceived
by
artful
mien
the
real
temper
must
at
home
be
seen
your
i
experienced
and
that
times
not
few
and
it
has
forced
me
oft
to
flee
from
you
when

of

becomes
our
only

we

with
others
with

you
when
i
in

the

up
some

had
done
well
but
you
to
save
your

left
me
to

myself
for

sake
another
way
pursue
that
as

may
speak
well
of
you
to
wretched

us
for

invoked
a

from

make
me
