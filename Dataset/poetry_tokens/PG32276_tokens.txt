the
bankrupt
oft
have
you
me
when
in
youth
never
to
err
from
paths
of
truth
but
youth
to
vice
is
much
too
prone
and
mine
by
far
too
much
i
own
induced
to
riot
swear
and
game
i
thought
in
vice
fame
but
found
the
scenes
of
riot
soon
my
mind
of
joy
and
quiet
the
usual
course
of
rakes
i
ran
the
dupe
of
woman
and
of
man
careless
of
smile
or
frown
my
desk
i
left
the
town
at
folly
in
spite
idled
by
day
by
night
but
short
was
that
delusive
scene
and
i
awoke
to
sorrow
keen
debt
on
debt
i
could
not
pay
and
found
that
credit
had
its
day
no
friend
to
aid
what
should
i
do
i
made
bad
worse
to
liquor
flew
for
when
my
i
i
shrunk
as
if
seen
my
shade
and
to
drive
terror
from
my
mind
drank
on
and
care
gave
to
the
wind
but
wine
nor
words
can
charm
away
the
clerk
who
comes
for
pay
payment
is
the
cash
is
gone
too
late
i
cry
must
be
done
horrow
a
docket
struck
appears
i
look
aghast
my
in
tears
the
naked
truth
stares
in
my
face
and
shows
me
more
than
one
disgrace
my
keys
a
messenger
demands
while
as
a
culprit
often
stands
the
humbled
bankrupt
lowers
his
view
and
sees
the
law
its
work
pursue
soon
comes
of
all
his
goods
the
sale
which
like
light
straw
before
a
gale
the
puffs
clean
away
and
cries
must
be
sold
this
they
are
so
and
tell
you
how
at
loss
readily
allow
then
comes
the
tedious
humbling
task
to
answer
all
ask
and
those
who
mean
to
act
most
fair
will
at
first
meeting
appear
to
questions
will
answer
true
and
clearly
state
accounts
to
view
a
second
he
need
not
attend
but
if
not
may
perhaps
offend
happy
the
man
who
then
can
lay
his
hand
upon
his
heart
and
say
all
my
books
and
deeds
may
scan
honest
though
man
my
own
just
wants
and
losses
great
have
brought
me
to
this
low
then
comes
the
last
dread
meeting
on
dreadful
to
such
as
will
act
wrong
and
through
dishonesty
or
shame
evasive
answers
to
frame
for
vain
his
shifts
he
try
he
elude
the
searching
eye
of
lawyers
in
all
things
pry
his
private
foibles
mast
grievous
exposure
no
doubt
and
if
found
must
go
to
witness
scenes
of
vice
and
woe
of
liberty
deprived
to
wail
his
faults
and
folly
in
a
jail
but
should
his
conduct
seem
least
fair
blest
laws
will
set
him
clear
not
only
so
but
means
will
give
him
again
to
live
for
such
the
law
that
when
found
fifteen
shillings
in
the
pound
a
handsome
drawback
when
of
shamed
he
may
look
proud
and
be
his
so
low
never
let
him
coinless
go
yes
be
it
a
pride
that
mercy
in
his
courts
preside
but
paid
he
must
await
a
fair
certificate
some
cases
there
however
are
which
at
first
view
may
seem
severe
suppose
his
creditors
are
ten
four
sign
the
rest
refuse
what
then
if
their
demand
exceed
the
four
keep
the
bankrupt
in
their
and
although
he
has
all
if
unproved
debts
remain
behind
inhuman
creditors
then
may
his
body
into
prison
lay
where
oft
the
wretch
to
sooth
his
grief
in
dissipation
seeks
relief
sometimes
a
parent
may
prevent
unmeaningly
the
intent
and
creditors
decline
the
hapless
deed
to
sign
in
hopes
the
father
may
one
day
the
debts
pay
the
lawyer
and
the
auctioneer
plunges
all
parties
in
despair
when
creditors
their
bills
do
see
each
sighing
say
left
for
me
an
address
to
the
insolvent
man

just
and
true

mean
your
person
from

advice
when

find
misfortunes
canker
in
your
mind
resign
your
trade

store
for
going
on
will
hurt
you
more
when

up
without
delay
too
apt
we
are
when
cares
oppress
to
liquor
fly
to
make
them
less
many
i
fear
from
business
stray
soon
as
they
find
they
can
not
pay
others
to
prisons
frequent
fly
to
waste
their
time
in
luxury
painful
sensations
are
their
doom
when
they
behold
a
gloom
do
not
suppose
i
mean
there
are
but
few
in
prisons
that
act
fair
yes
i
should
hope
not
one
in
ten
pursue
a
base
ungenerous
plan
if
your
fate
to
be
enter
a
jail
with
fervent
mind
to
give
up
all
were
all
is
due
and
course
through
life
pursue
abstain

of
your
wife

the
tear
that

from
her
by
despair
a
horrors

her
frame
when
she
at
entrance
say
her
name
perhaps
an
infant
in
her
arms
raise
in
your
mind
quick
alarms
sometimes
an
aged
father
flies
to
see
you
there
before
he
dies
likely
a
tender
mother
say
my
son
see
without
delay
each
brings
affections
sighs
and
tears
with
throbbing
hearts
and
thousand
fears
perhaps
their
little
all
they
give

a
tender
sister
close
the
scene
of
anguish
grief
and
sorrow
keen
she
gives
a
sigh
and
said
adieu
and

her
blessings

on
you
johnson
who
keeps
the
county
jail

captives

much
bewail
and
tries
the
utmost
in
his
power
to
soften
each
corroding
hour
of
those
appointed
to
his
care
and
lull
to
rest
the
despair
respect
to
all
he
daily
pay
while
they
the
prison
laws
obey
but
if
rules
they
break
coercive
steps
he
quickly
take
till
order
is
again
and
they
from
acting
wrong
refrain
each
turnkey

a
civil
man
and
will
oblige
you
if
they
can
yet
faithful
to
their
trust
they
are
and
will
do
nothing
unfair
on
city
prison
now

dwell
the
captives
like
their
keeper
well
they
say
kind
to
every
man
and
ease
their
troubles
all
he
can
to
the
memory
of
an
affectionate
parent
my
pen
can
not
describe
or
tears
convey
the
pangs
i
felt
when
late
i
bad
farewell
i
in
embrace
a
parent
lay
and
heard
the
passing
of
the
mournful
bell
nine
disease
its
ravages
had
made
death
her
from
all
sufferings
here
i
saw
the
sexton
with
his
iron
spade
mark
out
the
spot
and
place
the
gloomy
bier
affecting
scene
while
recollection
last
trace
the
parting
of
our
sad
adieu
dwell
on
those
scenes
that
are
for
ever
past
in
my
mind
it
troubles
fresh
renew
just
before
death
had
wield
the
fatal
blow
that
stops
the
power
of
utterance
or
sigh
she
with
a
voice
angelic
soft
and
low
cried
lord
forgive
me
my
spirit
fly
oft
have
i
seen
my
virtuous
parent
stray
her
garden
pensive
and
forlorn
to
cull
the
flowers
each
succeeding
day
and
view
the
beauties
of
a
morn
scarce
did
the
flower
adorn
the
spot
around
but
her
hand
planted
in
its
proper
place
no
fonder
lover
of
those
sweets
were
found
while
she
their
beauties
in
her
mind
trace
three
days
before
her
suffering
were
she
assistance
to
her
favourite
spot
and
said
my
roses
i
shall
see
no
more
and
when
absent
they
will
be
forgot
but
for
her
sake
a
faithful
servant
toil
to
free
the
flowers
from
weeds
from
morn
till
night
or
bring
fresh
water
to
the
thirsty
soil
to
that
spot
that
gave
her
oft
delight
anticipation
to
the
panting
heart
the
dread
decree
of
ordain
to
say
she
must
from
earthly
scenes
depart
and
not
to
them
for
ever
turn
again
meekness
life
had
her
for
her
care
while
resignation
her
for
her
own
sometimes
her
mind
cheerful
still
appear
and
strive
to
stifle
afflicting
groan
oh
god
she
cried
thy
mercy
let
me
crave
till
short
span
is
taken
quite
away
then
may
i
rest
at
peace
within
the
grave
to
wait
thy
summons
for
the
awful
day
scarce
had
religion
brought
sweet
hope
to
aid
the
virtuous
victim
in
the
pangs
of
death
when
soft
a
guardian
angel
gently
said
dwell
with
me
when
time
extinguish
breath
a
few
short
struggles
and
the
scene
was
death
with
his
victim
flew
above
the
skies
i
shall
life
her
absence
oft
deplore
till
recollection
from
my
memory
flies
the
humble
cottagers
their
mistress
bore
to
her
cold
home
each
face
with
tears
she
to
her
mansion
to
return
no
more
for
death
has
all
her
hopes
and
fears
oh
had
you
seen
my
good
and
worthy
sire
in
garment
his
last
duty
pay
to
her
whose
virtues
did
esteem
acquire
or
ease
the
troubles
of
a
luckless
day
two
sorrowing
sons
the
gloomy
day
who
will
while
life
remain
her
loss
deplore
till
recollection
from
them
fade
away
or
erring
mortals
here
do
sin
no
more
each
little
mourner
tear
when
dust
on
dust
the
coffin
hid
from
view
their
youthful
sighs
denoted
their
despair
when
they
of
bid
a
long
adieu
thoughts
on
passing
through
a
the
sacred
yard
oh
death
thy
sting
expunge
from
earth
the
beggar
and
the
king
a
marble
monument
a
stone
foretell
the
characters
below
here
acted
well
each
grave
a
warning
give
and
yet
we
see
few
strive
to
gain
a
eternity
kindred
and
neighbours
with
departing
sigh
cry
write
me
all
must
die
can
we
these
warnings
with
indifferance
view
and
still
a
life
of
guilt
and
sin
pursue
so
frail
our
natures
that
at
times
we
pray
at
church
at
morn
yet
sin
the
after
day
much
shall
we
tremble
when
the
trumpets
sound
to
call
us
to
our
god
with
angels
round
there
shall
we
tottering
hear
the
just
decree
of
him
alone
who
can
all
spirits
free
how
oft
we
find
when
sickness
brings
distress
we
wish
our
sufferings
and
our
crimes
were
less
it
is
our
crimes
that
most
our
anguish
brings
and
paint
grim
death
with
all
his
bitter
stings
then
erring
man
if
happiness
you
crave
repent
and
sin
no
more
this
side
the
grave
on
the
death
of
charles
savory
when
fortune
his
friendly
care
was
to
relieve
distress
and
ease
the
wretched
in
dispair
or
make
their
troubles
less
when
to
him
misfortune
no
brothers
gave
relief
to
assist
the

the
brow
of
grief
a
trifling
pittance

not
half
enough
in
decay
to
pay
his
nurse
and
rent
from
his
misfortunes
well
its
known
their
anger
did
increase
he
his
friend
would
make
it
known
he
died
with
all
at
peace
within
the
church
beside
his
wife
my
remains
are
laid
from
all
the
pangs
of
life
or

to
upbraid
benevolence

forth
with
speed

knavery
and
write
my

stray
from
honesty
both
night
and
day
when
fortune
smiles
friends
we
do
meet
that
greet
us
kindly
in
the
street
but
when

well
i
know

to
be
true
and
worthy
neighbours
so

you
when

he
smiling
bade
them
all
adieu
and
died
without
a
groan
yet
ere

flew
he
did
enquire
how
many
ships
were
then
on

a
poor
and
friendless
child
near
to
death

made
by

for
faults
so
small
that
blame
you
not

to
me
when
i

in

an
artless
maid
astray
was
stranger

and

remain
yes
thou

and
to
it
oft
attention
pay
without
a
sigh
or
pain
but
when
ye
do
in
heaven
appear
my
spirit
will
be
there
and
hear
thy
awful
doom
thy
soul
will
then
tormented
be
for
dealing
so
unjust
with
me
who
ere
my
bloom
when
virtuous
souls
are
with
the
blest
thy
guilty
shade
will
find
no

to
endless
pain
were

man
is
made
to
know
that
satan
dealt
the
painful
blow
and
will
torment
again
no

can
lull
to

my
fears
or
time
dry
up
my
falling
tears
till
i
from
life
am
flown
then
do
i
hope
once
more
to
see
my
parents
both
along
with
me
and
they
their
betsy
own
albert
to
hannah
read
your
letter
and
again
happy
to
find
you
faithful
do
remain
besides
forgiveness
though
too
much
i
fear
i
long
have
made
you
victim
to
despair
you
say
two
years
with
fervency
i
strove
to
keep
affection
constancy
and
love
but
soon
as
crosses
came
upon
my
mind
was
careless
of
you
and
unkind
i
knew
my
home
was
neat
serene
and
nice
but
ah
that
home
i
lost
allured
by
vice
soon
as
you
fled
a
different
scene
in
view
gone
all
attention
soon
as
i
lost
you
the
quick
retort
was
always
in
my
ears
a
virtuous
wife
in
tears
soon
as
i
found
all
hopes
to
meet
you
fled
i
i
might
be
with
the
dead
aid
i
oft
by
drink
i
could
not
meditate
nor
dared
to
think
you
say
it
cost
you
tears
to
write
to
me
but
disperse
when
you
a
convert
see
long
a
pardon
from
above
to
make
me
worthy
of
the
wife
i
love
return
and
till
my
days
are
at
an
end
prove
protector
guardian
and
a
friend
the
converse
delicate
the
smile
sincere
will
check
the
sigh
and
stop
the
rising
tear
cheerful
as
formerly
pass
our
life
a
happy
husband
i
and
you
the
wife
on
seeing
an
amiable
woman
distressed
in
mind
oh
gracious
god
her
peace
restore
and
make
her
sufferings
less
let
frenzied
thoughts
disturb
no
more
or
sorrow
on
her
press
pour
down
thy
blessings
on
a
mind
round
by
grief
let
fortune
smile
and
friends
be
kind
to
nature
grant
relief
pure
affection
her
tears
and
face
but
thou
can
lull
to
rest
her
fears
by
thy
almighty
grace
may
guardian
angels
plant
their
seat
beside
the
lovely
fair
while
hope
and
comfort
frequent
meet
to
keep
her
from
despair
tranquillity
thou
maid
a
visit
quickly
pay
of
self
be
not
afraid
stay
with
her
all
the
day
a
address
to
the
deity
accept
oh
lord
a
prayer
and
shield
my
child
from
sickness
here
may
judah
ever
constant
prove
herself
deserving
of
thy
love
sweet
robert
in
this
vale
of
tears
survived
with
me
three
sickening
years
before
it
was
thy
will
to
say
he
shall
the
debt
of
nature
pay
on
maria
now
i
dwell
my
grief
for
her
no
pen
can
tell
to
spare
a
pangs
she
flew
to
thee
ere
i
say
adieu
the
babe
was
not
a
year
with
me
ere
angels
wafted
her
to
thee
for
life
oh
lord
i
pray
and
too
both
night
and
day
should
it
be
thy
will
to
call
them
from
my
sight
i
pray
that
all
my
children
may
obtain
a
rest
were
souls
are
with
the
blest
henry
a
last
delight
improve
o
lord
his
health
and
sight
that
quick
i
find
his
strength
increase
my
thanks
to
thee
shall
never
cease
on
seeing
a
young
nobleman
imprisoned
for
debt
the
victim
of
sorrow
with
gloom
on
his
mind
sighs
for
those
pleasures
he
late
left
behind
the
bottle
the
and
ball
and
the
fine
guilded
chariot
kept
at
the
hall
but
at
night
in
dreams
with
sorrow
that
leaves
the
imprudent
as
hopeless
to
morrow
with
anguish
he
views
his
now
state
laments
his
past
folly
but
finds
it
too
late
his
bottle
companions
in
assistance
will
fail
soon
as
they
hear
he
is
in
a
jail
fair
rules
he
brings
to
his
view

in
future
her
plans
to
pursue
the
downfal
of
life
oft
the
delicate
kill
by
a
strong
dose
of
pill
neglected
in
prison
yields
up
his
life
and
leaves
in
despair
his
children
and
wife
to
return
to
her
once
more
endeavours
again
her
peace
to
restore
grief
so
once
a
heart
blith
and
gay
death
soon
and
took
her
quick
away
life
when
you
walk
the
hill
or
street
a
flaunting
dressing
thing
meet
her
wanton
air
would
fain
beguile
a
thoughtless
youth
to
stray
awhile
her
conversation
gross
find
chaste
modesty
she
leaves
behind
that
goddess
seldom
now
appear
where
people
walk
to
take
the
air
she
daily
must
in
laces
dress
her
parents
in
distress
get
them
any
way
she
can
to
marry
some
unthinking
man
when
he
the
flaunter
do
obtain
on
wings
she
fix
her
brain
his
shirts
or
stockings
she
mend
but
must
them
to
a
neighbour
send
and
tells
her
husband
he
must
stray
with
her
to
see
a
merry
play
he
must
comply
or
else
find
she
teazes
much
his
gloomy
mind
often
she
does
the
man
reproach
because
he
can
not
keep
a
coach
tells
him
she
can
not
rest
at
home
and
do
with
finer
people
roam
the
husband
now
appears
too
just
his
reason
for
his
fears
truth
silence
now
his
sad
alarms
fled
into
arms
parents
oft
cause
a
distress
by
letting
her
devote
to
dress
time
which
they
should
frequent
spend
at
or
their
clothes
to
mend
a
watch
must
now
adorn
the
side
to
fill
their
minds
with
erring
pride
tells
her
that
every
fop
admire
and
soon
gain
a
country
squire
again
i
say
a
boarding
school
too
often
makes
sweet
miss
a
fool
put
such
strange
notions
in
her
brain
as
she
can
not
good
sense
retain
when
miss
is
taken
from
the
school
she
wants
in
every
thing
to
rule
there
she
perhaps
may
learn
to
dance
alike
the
paltry
things
from
france
this
plain
truth
i
dare
to
tell
but
few
from
them
correctly
spell
too
often
write
so
bad
a
hand
that
scarce
one
line
you
understand
their
education
often
makes
them
only
fit
for
lords
or
rakes
to
miss
and
schools
i
bid
adieu
and
will
another
tale
pursue
many
a
tradesman
in
this
place
brings
on
themselves
their
own
disgrace
politics
engross
their
mind
and
cause
their
friends
to
be
unkind
the
horns
anounce
the
papers
in
his
daily
pleasures
now
begin
two
hours
are
wasted
in
this
day
which
time
he
should
to
business
pay
customers
too
frequent
call
and
can
not
see
the
man
at
all
each
one
declares
call
no
more
as
he
had
been
there
oft
before
no
wonder
that
he
can
not
pay
as
thus
he
trifles
time
away
we
often
do
our
fate
bewail
when
adverse
gales
do
us
assail
the
money
that
we
waste
away
frequent
we
should
to
others
pay
careless
of
our
neighbours
grief
we
only
seek
our
own
relief
the
cause
we
have
such
dismal
times
is
chiefly
owing
to
our
crimes
the
pipe
and
bottle
frequent
stay
the
man
who
should
attention
pay
to
business
or
to
any
thing
which
may
perhaps
a
profit
bring
insteads
of
wine
drink
humble
ale
drop
fine
gigs
thus
ends
my
tale
on
seeing
colours
consecrated
presented
by
berkley
berkley
the
female
champion
of
our
cause
while
gratitude
exists
demands
applause
the
morn
was
fine
and
pleasant
was
the
scene
the
sons
of
briton
met
on
writtle
green
to
church
with
fervency
and
grace
and
loyalty
on
every
face
prayers
were
read
with
energy
and
truth
to
give
instructions
to
the
british
youth
the
same
good
order
then
was
plainly
seen
when
they
advancing
to
the
green
the
line
was
and
music
now
begins
to
offer
praises
to
the
best
of
kings
the
captain
with
due
modesty
and
grace
marches
the
ensigns
to
their
proper
place
with
manners
pleasing
and
with
accents
just
the
worthy
fair
one
yields
the
sacred
trust
speaks
of
their
duty
in
the
hour
of
strife
never
to
yield
those
colours
but
with
life
with
manliness
the
captain
quick
replies
no
man
will
yield
them
madam
till
he
dies
ensigns
them
from
the
hand
may
god
protect
them
