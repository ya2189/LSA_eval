for
permission
to
reprint
certain
of
these
poems
introduction
the
nature
of
the
we
are
often
so
impressed
by
the
power
of
poetry
that
we
think
of
it
as
something
made
by
a
wonderful
and
unusual
person
we
do
not
realize
the
fact
that
all
the
wonder
and
marvel
is
in
our
own
brains
that
the
poet
is
ourselves
he
speaks
our
language
better
than
we
do
merely
because
he
is
more
skilful
with
it
than
we
are
his
skill
is
part
of
our
skill
his
power
of
our
power
generations
of
men
and
women
have
made
us
sensible
to
these
things
and
our
sensibility
comes
from
the
same
source
that
the
poet
power
of
stimulating
it
comes
from
given
a
little
more
sensitiveness
to
external
stimuli
a
little
more
power
of
associating
ideas
a
of
the
functions
of
expression
somewhat
more
apt
a
sense
of
rhythm
somewhat
keener
than
the
average
given
these
things
we
should
be
poets
too
even
as
he
is
is
one
of
what
english
poetry
english
poetry
is
not
a
rhythm
of
sound
but
a
rhythm
of
ideas
and
the
flow
of
varying
qualities
of
words
and
cadence
which
determines
its
beauty
is
inseparably
connected
with
the
thought
for
each
of
them
is
a
judgment
of
identity
or
a
judgment
of
relation
or
an
expression
of
relation
and
not
a
thing
of
mere
empty
sound
he
who
would
think
of
it
as
a
pleasing
arrangement
of
vocal
sounds
has
missed
all
chance
of
ever
understanding
its
meaning
there
awaits
him
only
the
barren
generalities
of
a
foreign
prosody
tedious
pedantic
fruitless
and
he
will
flounder
ceaselessly
amid
the
scattered
timbers
of
its
iambuses
spondees
dactyls
tribrachs
never
reaching
the
firm
ground
of
truth
an
introduction
to
the
scientific
study
of
english
poetry
mark
liddell
by
grant
richards
this
remarkable
book
establishing
english
poetry
as
a
thing
governed
from
within
by
its
own
necessities
and
not
by
rules
of
æsthetics
imposed
on
it
from
without
formulates
principles
which
unperceived
have
governed
english
poetry
from
the
earliest
times
which
find
their
greatest
exemplar
in
shakespeare
and
which
though
beginning
to
be
realized
by
the
less
pedantic
of
the
moderns
are
in
its
pages
for
the
first
time
lucidly
expounded
and
such
is
their
adequacy
can
in
the
end
only
be
regarded
as
indubitably
book
i
ardours
and
endurances
to
the
memory
of
my
trusty
and
gallant
friends
harold
stuart
gough
royal
rifle
and
richard
pinsent
worcester
for
what
is
life
if
measured
by
the
space
not
by
the
act
ben
jonson
the
summons
to
asleep
within
the
deadest
hour
of
night
and
turning
with
the
earth
i
was
aware
how
suddenly
the
eastern
curve
was
bright
as
when
the
sun
arises
from
his
lair
but
not
the
sun
arose
it
was
thy
hair
shaken
up
heaven
in
tossing
leagues
of
light
since
then
i
know
that
neither
night
nor
day
may
i
escape
thee
o
my
heavenly
hell
awake
in
dreams
thou
springest
to
waylay
and
should
i
dare
to
die
i
know
full
well
whose
voice
would
mock
me
in
the
mourning
bell
whose
face
would
greet
me
in
hell
fiery
way
the
past
how
to
escape
the
bondage
of
the
past
i
fly
thee
yet
my
spirit
finds
no
calms
save
when
she
deems
her
rocked
within
those
arms
to
which
from
which
she
was
caught
or
cast
o
sadness
of
a
heart
so
spent
in
vain
that
drank
its
age
fuel
in
an
hour
for
whom
the
whole
world
burning
had
not
power
to
quick
with
life
the
smouldered
wick
again
the
reckoning
the
whole
world
burns
and
with
it
burns
my
flesh
arise
thou
spirit
spent
by
sterile
tears
thine
eyes
were
ardent
once
thy
looks
were
fresh
thy
brow
shone
bright
amid
thy
shining
peers
fame
calls
thee
not
thou
who
hast
vainly
strayed
so
far
for
her
nor
passion
who
in
the
past
gave
thee
her
ghost
to
wed
and
to
be
paid
nor
love
whose
anguish
only
learned
to
last
honour
it
is
that
calls
canst
thou
forget
once
thou
wert
strong
listen
the
solemn
call
sounds
but
this
once
again
put
by
regret
for
summons
missed
or
thou
hast
missed
them
all
body
is
ready
fortune
pleased
o
let
not
the
poor
past
cost
the
proud
future
fall
farewell
to
place
of
comfort
farewell
to
place
of
comfort
for
the
last
time
maybe
upon
the
knoll
i
stand
the
eve
is
golden
languid
sad
day
like
a
tragic
actor
plays
his
rôle
to
the
last
whispered
word
and
falls
i
too
take
leave
of
all
i
ever
had
they
shall
not
say
i
went
with
heavy
heart
heavy
i
am
but
soon
i
shall
be
free
i
love
them
all
but
o
i
now
depart
a
little
sadly
strangely
fearfully
as
one
who
goes
to
try
a
mystery
the
bell
is
sounding
down
in
dedham
vale
be
still
o
bell
too
often
standing
here
when
all
the
air
was
tremulous
fine
and
pale
thy
golden
note
so
calm
so
still
so
clear
out
of
my
stony
heart
has
struck
a
tear
and
now
tears
are
not
mine
i
have
release
from
all
the
former
and
the
later
pain
like
the
i
rock
in
boundless
peace
soothed
by
the
charity
of
the
deep
sea
rain
calm
rain
calm
sea
calm
found
long
sought
in
vain
o
bronzen
pines
evening
of
gold
and
blue
steep
mellow
slope
brimmed
twilit
pools
below
hushed
trees
still
vale
dissolving
in
the
dew
farewell
farewell
there
is
no
more
to
do
we
have
been
happy
happy
now
i
go
the
approach
in
the
grass
halt
by
roadside
in
my
tired
helpless
body
i
feel
my
sunk
heart
ache
but
suddenly
loudly
the
far
the
great
guns
shake
is
it
sudden
terror
burdens
my
heart
my
hand
flies
to
my
head
i
listen
and
do
not
understand
is
death
so
near
then
from
this
blaze
of
light
do
i
plunge
suddenly
into
vortex
night
guns
again
the
quiet
shakes
at
the
vengeful
voice
it
is
terrible
pleasure
i
do
not
fear
i
rejoice
the
day
march
the
battery
grides
and
jingles
mile
succeeds
to
mile
shaking
the
noonday
sunshine
the
guns
lunge
out
awhile
and
then
are
still
awhile
we
amble
along
the
highway
the
reeking
powdery
dust
ascends
and
cakes
our
faces
with
a
striped
sweaty
crust
under
the
still
sky
violet
the
heat
thróbs
on
the
air
the
white
road
dusty
radiance
assumes
a
dark
glare
with
a
head
hot
and
heavy
and
eyes
that
can
not
rest
and
a
black
heart
burning
in
a
stifled
breast
i
sit
in
the
saddle
i
feel
the
road
unroll
and
keep
my
senses
straightened
toward
goal
there
over
unknown
meadows
which
we
must
reach
at
last
day
and
night
thunders
a
black
and
chilly
blast
heads
forget
heaviness
hearts
forget
spleen
for
by
that
mighty
winnowing
being
is
blown
clean
light
in
the
eyes
again
strength
in
the
hand
a
spirit
dares
dies
forgives
and
can
understand
and
best
love
comes
back
again
after
grief
and
shame
and
along
the
wind
of
death
throws
a
clean
flame
the
battery
grides
and
jingles
mile
succeeds
to
mile
suddenly
battering
the
silence
the
guns
burst
out
awhile
i
lift
my
head
and
smile
nearer
nearer
and
ever
nearer
my
body
tired
but
tense
hovers
vague
pleasure
and
tremulous
confidence
arms
to
have
and
to
use
them
and
a
soul
to
be
made
worthy
if
not
worthy
if
afraid
unafraid
to
endure
for
a
little
to
endure
and
have
done
men
i
love
about
me
over
me
the
sun
and
should
at
last
suddenly
fly
the
speeding
death
the
four
great
quarters
of
heaven
receive
this
little
breath
battle
noon
it
is
midday
the
deep
trench
glares
a
buzz
and
blaze
of
flies
the
hot
wind
puffs
the
giddy
airs
the
great
sun
rakes
the
skies
no
sound
in
all
the
stagnant
trench
where
forty
standing
men
endure
the
sweat
and
grit
and
stench
like
cattle
in
a
pen
sometimes
a
sniper
bullet
whirs
or
twangs
the
whining
wire
sometimes
a
soldier
sighs
and
stirs
as
in
hell
frying
fire
from
out
a
high
cool
cloud
descends
an
aeroplane
far
moan
the
sun
strikes
down
the
thin
cloud
rends
the
black
speck
travels
on
and
sweating
dizzied
isolate
in
the
hot
trench
beneath
we
bide
the
next
shrewd
move
of
fate
be
it
of
life
or
death
night
bombardment
softly
in
the
silence
the
evening
rain
descends
the
soft
wind
lifts
the
flurries
it
and
spends
its
grief
in
mournful
sighs
drifting
from
field
to
field
soaking
the
draggled
sprays
which
the
low
hedges
wield
as
they
labour
in
the
wet
and
the
load
of
the
wind
the
last
light
is
dimming
night
comes
on
behind
i
hear
no
sound
but
the
wind
and
the
rain
and
trample
of
horses
loud
and
lost
again
where
the
waggons
in
the
mist
rumble
dimly
on
bringing
more
shell
the
last
gleam
is
gone
it
is
not
day
or
night
only
the
mists
unroll
and
blind
with
their
sorrow
the
sight
of
my
soul
i
hear
the
wind
weeping
in
the
hollow
overhead
she
goes
searching
for
the
forgotten
dead
hidden
in
the
hedges
or
trodden
into
muck
under
the
trenches
or
maybe
limply
stuck
somewhere
in
the
branches
of
a
high
lonely
tree
he
was
a
sniper
once
they
never
found
his
body
i
see
the
mist
drifting
i
hear
the
wind
and
rain
and
on
my
clammy
face
the
oozed
breath
of
the
slain
seems
to
be
blowing
almost
i
have
heard
in
the
shuddering
drift
the
lost
dead
last
word
go
home
go
home
go
to
my
house
knock
at
the
door
knock
hard
arouse
my
wife
and
the
children
that
you
must
do
what
do
you
say
tell
the
children
too
knock
at
the
door
knock
hard
arouse
the
living
say
the
dead
wo
come
back
to
this
house
o
but
it
cold
i
soak
in
the
rain
shrapnel
found
me
i
sha
come
home
again
no
not
home
again
the
mourning
voices
trail
away
into
rain
into
darkness
the
pale
soughing
of
the
night
drifts
on
in
between
voices
were
as
if
the
dead
had
never
o
melancholy
heavens
o
melancholy
fields
the
glad
full
darkness
grows
complete
and
shields
me
from
your
appeal
with
a
terrible
delight
i
hear
far
guns
low
like
oxen
at
the
night
flames
disrupt
the
sky
the
work
is
begun
action
my
guns
crash
flame
rock
and
stun
again
and
again
soon
the
soughing
night
is
loud
with
their
clamour
and
leaps
with
their
light
the
imperative
chorus
rises
sonorous
and
fell
my
heart
glows
lighted
as
by
fires
of
hell
sharply
i
pass
the
terse
orders
down
the
guns
blare
and
rock
the
hissing
rain
is
blown
athwart
the
hurtled
shell
that
shrilling
shrilling
goes
away
into
the
dark
to
burst
a
cloud
of
rose
over
german
trenches
a
pause
i
stand
and
see
lifting
into
the
night
like
founts
incessantly
the
pale
spores
upon
the
glimmering
air
under
them
furrowed
trenches
empty
pallid
bare
and
rain
snowing
trenchward
ghostly
and
white
o
dead
in
the
hedges
sleep
ye
well
comrades
an
episode
before
before
he
was
aware
the
light
had
risen
on
the
air
it
hung
glistering
and
he
could
not
stay
his
hand
from
moving
to
the
barbed
wire
broken
strand
a
rifle
cracked
he
fell
night
waned
he
was
alone
a
heavy
shell
whispered
itself
passing
high
high
overhead
his
wound
was
wet
to
his
hand
for
still
it
bled
on
to
the
glimmering
ground
then
with
a
slow
vain
smile
his
wound
he
bound
knowing
of
course
he
not
see
home
again
home
whose
thought
he
put
away
his
men
whispered
where
mister
gates
out
on
the
wire
i
get
him
said
one
dawn
blinked
and
the
fire
of
the
germans
heaved
up
and
down
the
line
stand
to
too
late
i
get
him
o
the
swine
when
we
might
get
him
in
yet
safe
and
whole
corporal
did
see
fall
out
on
patrol
or
he
got
sssh
no
talking
there
a
whisper
went
down
at
the
last
flare
meanwhile
the
maxims
their
swish
of
bullets
told
death
lurked
against
the
wish
no
hope
for
him
his
corporal
as
one
shamed
vainly
and
helplessly
his
blamed
then
gates
slowly
saw
the
morn
break
in
a
rosy
peace
through
the
lone
thorn
by
which
he
lay
and
felt
the
pass
whispering
through
the
pallid
stalky
grass
of
land
and
the
tears
came
scaldingly
sweet
more
lovely
than
a
flame
he
closed
his
eyes
he
thought
of
home
and
grit
his
teeth
he
knew
no
help
could
come
the
silent
sun
over
the
earth
held
sway
occasional
rifles
cracked
and
far
away
a
heedless
speck
a
slid
on
alone
like
a
fly
traversing
a
cliff
of
stone
i
must
get
back
said
gates
aloud
and
heaved
at
his
body
but
it
lay
bereaved
of
any
power
he
could
not
wait
till
night
and
he
lay
still
blood
swam
across
his
sight
then
with
a
groan
no
luck
ever
well
i
must
die
alone
occasional
rifles
cracked
a
cloud
that
shone
blackened
the
sun
and
then
was
gone
the
sun
still
smiled
the
grass
sang
in
its
play
someone
whistled
over
the
hills
and
far
away
gates
watched
silently
the
swift
swift
sun
burning
his
life
before
it
was
begun
suddenly
he
heard
corporal
timmins
voice
now
then
up
with
that
tea
hi
ginger
bill
his
men
timmins
and
jones
and
wilkinson
the
and
hughes
and
simpson
it
was
hard
not
to
see
them
wilkinson
stubby
grim
with
his
no
sir
yes
sir
and
the
slim
simpson
indeed
sir
while
it
seemed
he
winked
because
his
smiling
left
eye
always
blinked
and
corporal
timmins
straight
and
blonde
and
wise
with
his
level
hazel
eyes
and
all
the
others
tunics
that
did
fit
a
dozen
different
sorts
of
eyes
o
it
was
hard
to
lie
there
yet
he
must
but
no
i
got
to
die
i
get
to
them
i
go
inch
by
inch
he
fought
breathless
and
mute
dragging
his
carcase
like
a
famished
brute
his
head
was
hammering
and
his
eyes
were
dim
a
bloody
sweat
seemed
to
ooze
out
of
him
and
freeze
along
his
spine
then
he
lie
still
before
another
effort
of
his
will
took
him
one
nearer
yard
the
parapet
was
reached
he
could
not
rise
to
it
a
lookout
screeched
mr
gates
three
figures
in
one
breath
leaped
up
two
figures
fell
in
toppling
death
and
gates
was
lifted
in
who
hit
said
he
timmins
and
jones
why
did
they
that
for
me
i
gone
already
gently
they
laid
him
prone
and
silently
watched
he
twitched
they
heard
him
moan
why
for
me
his
eyes
roamed
round
and
none
replied
i
see
it
was
alone
i
should
have
died
they
shook
their
heads
then
is
the
doctor
here
he
coming
sir
he
hurryin
no
fear
no
good
lift
me
they
lifted
him
he
smiled
and
held
his
arms
out
to
the
dim
and
in
a
moment
passed
beyond
their
ken
hearing
him
whisper
o
my
men
my
men
in
hospital
london
behind
the
lines
night
france
at
the
i
halt
and
stand
the
linked
and
flickering
constellations
climb
slowly
the
spread
black
heaven
immensity
the
wind
wanders
like
a
thought
at
fault
within
the
cottage
nigh
i
hear
while
its
fearful
ag
master
sleeps
like
the
dead
a
slow
clock
chime
with
solemn
thrill
the
most
sombre
hour
of
time
and
see
stand
in
the
cottage
garden
chill
the
two
white
crosses
one
at
each
grave
head
o
france
france
france
i
loved
you
love
you
still
but
oh
why
took
you
not
my
life
instead
at
the
wars
now
that
i
am
away
and
may
not
see
another
day
what
is
it
to
my
eye
appears
what
sound
rings
in
my
stricken
ears
not
even
the
voice
of
any
friend
or
eyes
but
scenes
and
sounds
of
the
countryside
in
far
england
across
the
tide
an
upland
field
when
spring
begun
mellow
beneath
the
evening
sun
a
circle
of
loose
and
lichened
wall
over
which
seven
red
pines
fall
an
orchard
of
wizen
blossoming
trees
wherein
the
nesting
chaffinches
begin
again
the
song
all
the
late
april
long
paths
that
lead
a
shelving
course
between
the
chalk
scarp
and
the
gorse
by
english
downs
and
o
too
well
i
hear
the
hidden
clanking
bell
of
wandering
sheep
i
see
the
brown
twilight
of
the
huge
empty
down
soon
blotted
out
for
now
a
lane
glitters
with
warmth
of
rain
and
on
a
shooting
briar
i
see
a
yellow
bird
who
sings
to
me
o
once
i
heard
thy
yaffle
when
no
other
bird
could
to
my
sunk
heart
comfort
bring
but
now
i
would
not
have
thee
sing
so
sharp
thy
note
is
with
the
pain
of
england
i
may
not
see
again
yet
sing
thy
song
there
answereth
deep
in
me
a
voice
which
saith
gorse
upon
the
twilit
down
the
english
loam
so
sunset
brown
the
bowed
pines
and
the
clamour
the
wet
lit
lane
and
the
the
orchard
and
the
chaffinch
song
only
to
the
brave
belong
and
he
shall
lose
their
joy
for
aye
if
their
price
he
can
not
pay
who
shall
find
them
dearer
far
enriched
by
blood
after
long
out
of
trenches
the
barn
twilight
in
the
raftered
barn
we
lie
sprawl
scrawl
postcards
laugh
and
speak
just
mere
men
a
trifle
weary
worn
in
heart
a
trifle
weak
because
alway
at
close
of

steals
to

with

the

i

moving
up

position
from

camp
dawn
not
a
sign
of
life
we
rouse
in
any
square
house
that
flanks
the
road
we
amble
down
toward
far
trenches
through
the
town
the
dark
empty
street
tingle
of
frost
in
brow
and
feet
goes
dimly
up
like
smoke
no
sound
but
the
smacking
stroke
of
a
sergeant
flings
each
arm
out
and
across
to
keep
him
warm
and
the
sudden
splashing
crack
of
broken
by
our
track
more
dark
houses
yet
no
sign
of
life
an
axle
creak
and
whine
the
splash
of
hooves
the
strain
of
trace
clatter
we
cross
the
market
place
deep
quiet
again
and
on
we
lurch
under
the
shadow
of
a
church
its
tower
ascends
and
grim
within
its
aisles
a
light
burns
dim
when
marvellous
from
overhead
like
abrupt
speech
of
one
deemed
dead
by
some
superior
will
a
bell
tolls
thrice
and
then
is
still
and
suddenly
i
know
that
now
the
priest
within
with
shining
brow
lifts
high
the
small
round
of
the
host
the
server
tingling
bell
is
lost
in
clash
of
the
greater
overhead
peace
like
a
wave
descends
is
spread
while
watch
the
peasants
reverent
eyes
the
bell
boom
trembles
hangs
and
dies
o
people
who
bow
down
to
see
the
miracle
of
calvary
the
bitter
and
the
glorious
bow
down
bow
down
and
pray
for
us
once
more
our
anguished
way
we
take
toward
our
golgotha
to
make
for
all
our
lovers
sacrifice
again
the
troubled
bell
tolls
thrice
and
slowly
slowly
lifted
up
dazzles
the
overflowing
cup
o
worshipping
fond
multitude
remember
us
too
and
our
blood
turn
hearts
to
us
as
we
go
by
salute
those
about
to
die
plead
for
them
the
deep
bell
toll
their
sacrifice
must
soon
be
whole
entreat
you
for
such
hearts
as
break
with
the
premonitory
ache
of
bodies
whose
feet
hands
and
side
must
soon
be
torn
pierced
crucified
sue
for
them
and
all
of
us
who
the
world
over
suffer
thus
who
have
scarce
time
for
prayer
indeed
who
only
march
and
die
and
bleed
the
town
is
left
the
road
leads
on
bluely
glaring
in
the

zero
is
the
hour
agreed
upon
by
the
staff
when
the
infantry
are
to
go
over
the
parapet
and
advance
to
the
assault
guns
are
said
to
lift
when
after
pounding
the
front
line
of
the
enemy
they
lengthen
their
range
and
set
up
a
barrier
of
fire
behind
his
front
line
to
prevent
supports
moving
up
our
infantry
then
advance
the
beating
of
the
guns
grows
louder

cheerful
full
of

lined
by

bodies
enraptured
by

beloved

are

the
dead
the
burial
in
flanders
ypres
through
the
light
rain
i
think
i
see
them
going
through
the
light
rain
under
the
muffled
skies
across
the
fields
a
stealthy
wet
wind
wanders
the
mist
bedews
their
tunics
dizzies
their
brains
khaki
shoulder
by
shoulder
they
bear
my
boy
upon
his
last
journey
night
is
closing
the
wind
sighs
ebbs
and
falters
they
totter
dreaming
deem
they
see
his
face
even
as
vikings
of
old
their
slaughtered
leader
upon
their
shoulders
so
now
bear
they
on
all
that
remains
of
boy
my
friend
their
leader
an
officer
who
died
for
them
under
the
dawn
o
that
i
were
there
that
i
might
carry
might
share
that
bitter
load
in
grief
in
pride
i
see
upon
bronze
faces
love
submission
and
a
dumb
sorrow
for
that
cheerful
boy
now
they
arrive
the
priest
repeats
the
service
the
drifting
rain
obscures
they
are
dispersed
the
dying
sun
streams
out
a
moment
radiance
the
still
wet
glistening
grave
the
trod
sward
steaming
sudden
great
guns
startle
echoing
on
the
silence
thunder
thunder
he
has
fallen
in
battle
o
boy
boy
lessening
now
the
rain
patters
anew
far
guns
rumble
and
shudder
and
night
descends
upon
the
desolate
plain
lawford
boy
in
a
far
field
away
from
england
lies
a
boy
i
friended
with
a
care
like
love
all
day
the
wide
earth
aches
the
cold
wind
cries
the
melancholy
clouds
drive
on
above
there
separate
from
him
by
a
little
span
two
eagle
cousins
generous
reckless
free
two
grenfells
lie
and
my
boy
is
made
man
one
with
these
elder
knights
of
chivalry
boy
who
expected
not
this
dreadful
day
yet
leaped
a
soldier
at
the
sudden
call
drank
as
your
fathers
deeper
though
than
they
the
soldier
cup
of
anguish
blood
and
gall
not
now
as
friend
but
as
a
soldier
i
salute
you
fallen
for
the
soldier
name
our
greatest
honour
is
if
worthily
these
wayward
hearts
assume
and
bear
the
same
the
soldier
is
a
name
none
recognize
saving
his
fellows
deeds
are
all
his
flower
he
lives
he
toils
he
suffers
and
he
dies
and
if
not
all
in
vain
this
is
his
dower
the
soldier
is
the
martyr
of
a
nation
expresses
but
is
subject
to
its
will
his
is
the
pride
ennobles
resignation
as
his
the
rebel
anonymous
he
takes
his
country
name
becomes
its
blindest
vassal
though
its
lord
by
force
of
arms
its
shame
is
called
his
shame
as
its
the
glory
gathered
by
his
sword
lonely
he
is
he
has
nor
friend
nor
lover
sith
in
his
body
he
is
dedicate
his
comrades
only
share
his
life
or
offer
their
further
deeds
to
one
more
heart
oblate
living
he
made
an
for
others
peace
but
when
hot
wars
have
birth
for
all
his
brothers
safety
becomes
bond
to
fate
or
whatsoever
sways
this
earth
dying
his
mangled
body
to
inter
it
he
doth
bequeath
him
into
comrade
hands
his
soul
he
renders
to
some
captain
spirit
that
knows
admires
pities
and
understands
all
this
you
knew
by
that
which
doth
reside
deeper
than
learning
by
apprehension
of
ancient
dark
and
melancholy
pride
you
were
a
soldier
true
and
died
as
one
all
day
the
cold
wind
cries
the
clouds
unroll
but
to
the
cloud
and
wind
i
cry
be
still
what
need
of
comfort
has
the
heroic

grave
is
chill
lawford
plaint
of

by
death
broken
loos
god
if
thou
livest
thine
eye
on
me
bend
and
stay
my
grief
and
bring
my
pain
to
end
pain
for
my
lost
the
deepest
rarest
friend
ever
had
whence
groweth
this
i
had
a
friend
but
o
he
is
now
dead
i
had
a
vision
for
which
he
has
bled
i
had
happiness
but
it
is
fled
help
me
now
for
i
must
needs
his
eyes
were
dark
and
sad
yet
never
sad
in
them
moved
sombre
figures
they
were
the
deepest
eyes
man
ever
had
they
were
my
solemn
joy
my
in
my
perpetual
night
they
on
me
look
reading
me
slowly
and
i
can
not
brook
their
silent
beauty
for
nor
crack
nor
nook
can
cover
me
but
they
shall
find
me
there
his
face
was
straight
his
mouth
was
wide
yet
trim
his
hair
was
tangled
black
and
through
its
dim
softness
his
perplexed
hand
would
writhe
and
swim
hands
that
were
small
on
arms
yet
spare
he
stood
no
taller
than
our
common
span
swam
but
nor
farther
leaped
nor
faster
ran
i
know
him
spirit
now
who
seemed
a
man
help
me
now
for
i
must
needs
his
voice
was
low
and
clear
yet
it
could
rise
and
beat
in
indignation
at
the
skies
then
no
man
dared
to
meet
his
eyes
and
even
i
his
own
friend
did
not
dare
with
humorous
wistfulness
he
spoke
to
us
yet
there
was
something
more
mysterious
beyond
his
words
or
silence
glorious
i
know
not
what
but
we
could
feel
it
there
i
mind
now
how
we
sat
one
winter
night
while
past
his
open
window
raced
the
bright
golden
in
the
hot
firelight
i
see
him
smiling
at
the
streamered
air
i
watched
him
to
the
open
window
go
and
lean
long
smiling
whispering
to
the
snow
play
with
his
hands
amid
the
fiery
flow
and
when
he
turned
it
flamed
amid
his
hair
without
arose
a
sudden
bell
huge
clang
until
a
thousand
bells
in
answer
rang
and
midnight
oxford
hummed
and
reeled
and
sang
under
the
whitening
fury
of
the
air
his
figure
standing
in
the
fiery
room
behind
him
the
snow
seething
through
the
gloom
the
great
bells
shaking
thundering
out
their
doom
soft
fiery
snow
and
night
his
being
were
yet
he
could
be
simply
glad
and
take
his
choice
walking
spring
woods
mimicking
each
bird
voice
when
he
was
glad
we
learned
how
to
rejoice
if
the
birds
sing
is
to
my
spite
they
dare
all
women
loved
him
yet
his
mother
won
his
tenderness
alone
for
moon
and
sun
and
rain
were
for
him
sister
brother
lovèd
one
and
in
their
life
he
took
an
equal
share
strength
he
had
too
strength
of
unrusted
will
buttressed
his
natural
charity
and
ill
fared
it
with
him
who
sought
his
good
to
kill
he
was
its
prince
and
champion
anywhere
yet
he
had
weakness
for
he
burned
too
fast
and
his
body
at
the
last
he
in
impatience
on
the
bayonets
cast
body
whose
spirit
had
outsoared
them
there
i
had
a
friend
but
o
he
is
now
dead
fate
would
not
let
me
follow
where
he
led
in
him
i
had
happiness
but
he
is
dead
help
me
now
for
i
must
needs
god
if
thou
livest
and
indeed
didst
send
thine
only
son
to
be
to
all
a
friend
bid
his
dark
pitying
eyes
upon
me
bend
and
his
hand
heal
or
must
needs
in
hospital
by
the
wood
how
still
the
day
is
and
the
air
how
bright
a
thrush
sings
and
is
silent
in
the
wood
the
hillside
sleeps
dizzy
with
heat
and
light
a
rhythmic
murmur
fills
the
quietude
a
woodpecker
prolongs
his
leisured
flight
rising
and
falling
on
the
solitude
but
there
are
those
who
far
from
yon
wood
lie
buried
within
the
trench
where
all
were
found
a
weight
of
mould
oppresses
every
eye
within
that
cabin
close
their
limbs
are
bound
and
there
they
rot
amid
the
long
profound
disastrous
silence
of
grey
earth
and
sky
these
once
too
rested
where
now
rests
but
one
who
scarce
can
lift
his
panged
and
heavy
head
who
drinks
in
grief
the
hot
light
of
the
sun
whose
eyes
watch
dully
the
green
branches
spread
who
feels
his
currents
ever
slowlier
run
whose
lips
repeat
a
silent
dead
all
dead
o
youths
to
come
shall
drink
air
warm
and
bright
shall
hear
the
bird
cry
in
the
sunny
wood
all
my
young
england
fell
in
fight
that
bird
that
wood
was
ransomed
by
our
blood
i
pray
you
when
the
drum
rolls
let
your
mood
be
worthy
of
our
deaths
and
your
delight
the
aftermath
at
the
ebb
alone
upon
the
monotonous
ocean
verge
i
take
my
stand
and
view
with
heavy
eye
the
grey
wave
rise
i
hear
its
sullen
surge
its
bubbling
rush
and
sudden
downward
sigh
my
friends
are
dead
there
fades
from
me
the
light
of
her
warm
face
i
loved
upon
me
stare
in
the
dull
noon
or
deadest
hour
of
night
the
smiling
lips
and
chill
eyes
of
despair
a
light
wind
blows
i
hear
the
low
wave
steal
in
and
collapse
like
a
despondent
breath
my
life
has
ebbed
i
neither
see
nor
feel
i
am
suspended
between
life
and
death
again
the
wave
caves
in
o
i
am
worn
smoother
than
any
pebble
on
the
beach
i
would
dissolve
to
that
whence
i
was
born
or
alway
bide
beyond
the
long
wave
reach
o
will
thou
only
strengthener
of
man
heart
when
all
is
gone
love
and
the
love
of
friends
when
even
earth
comfort
has
become
a
part
of
that
futility
nor
breaks
nor
mends
strengthen
me
now
against
these
utmost
wrongs
stay
my
wrecked
spirit
within
thy
control
that
men
may
find
some
fury
in
my
songs
which
like
strong
wine
shall
fortify
the
soul
beneath
gold
cap
alone
the
grey
wind
and
the
grey
sea
tossing
under
the
long
grey
sky
my
heart
is
lonelier
than
the
wind
my
heart
is
emptier
than
the
sky
and
beats
more
heavily
than
the
cold
surge
beneath
the
gull
wheeling
with
his
reiterant
cry
of
loneliness
all
all
is
lone
alone
and
so
am
i
thanksgiving
amazement
fills
my
heart
amaze
and
awful
fears
i
am
a
ship
that
sees
no
light
but
blindly
onward
steers
flung
toward
heaven
toppling
rage
sunk
between
steep
and
steep
a
lost
and
wondrous
fight
i
wage
with
the
embattled
deep
i
neither
know
nor
care
at
length
where
drives
the
storm
about
only
i
summon
all
my
strength
and
swear
to
ride
it
out
yet
give
i
thanks
despite
these
wars
my
ship
though
blindly
blown
long
lost
to
sun
or
moon
or
stars
still
stands
up
alone
i
need
no
trust
in
borrowed
spars
my
strength
is
yet
my
own
annihilated
upon
the
sweltering
sea
enormous
round
asmoke
adazzle
brown
and
brown
and
gold
a
hushed
light
falls
then
clouds
without
a
sound
darken
the
sea
within
their
curtain
fold
the
sombre
clouds
through
which
the
sick
sun
climbs
smoke
slowly
on
below
there
is
no
breath
the
long
black
beach
turns
livid
the
sea
chimes
i
taste
the
fulness
of
my
spirit
death
shut
of
night
the
sea
darkens
waves
roar
and
rush
the
wind
rises
the
last
birds
haste
one
star
over
eve
bitter
flush
spills
on
the
spouting
waste
loud
and
louder
the
darkened
sea
the
wind
shrills
on
a
monotone
sky
and
deep
wrecked
confusedly
travail
and
cry
as
one
long
i
look
on
the
deepening
sky
the
chill
star
the
forlorn
sea
breaking
for
what
does
my
spirit
cry
for
what
is
my
heart
so
aching
is
it
home
but
i
have
no
home
is
it
tears
but
i
no
more
weep
is
it
love
love
went
by
dumb
is
it
sleep
but
i
would
not
sleep
must
i
fare
then
in
fear
and
fever
on
a
journey
become
thrice
far
whose
sun
has
gone
down
for
ever
whose
night
brings
no
guiding
star
the
wind
roars
and
an
ashen
beam
waving
up
shrinks
away
in
haste
the
waves
crash
the
star
trickling
gleam
travels
the
warring
waste
i
look
up
in
the
windy
height
the
lone
orb
serene
and
afar
shakes
with
excess
of
her
light
beauty
be
thou

star

full

on
the
shore
in
the
pause
of

i

i

the
constellations
quietly
quietly
burning
i
hear
the

fall
in
the
hush

the
night

after
i

intends
the
hulli
and
the

of
the
call
in

to
be
pronounced
as
if
they
rhymed
with
such
a
word
as
fully
a
faun
holiday
i
hark
a
sound
is
it
i
sleep
the
wake
i
or
do
my
senses
keep
commune
yet
with
thoughtful
night
and
dream
they
feel
not
see
the
light
that
with
a
chord
as
if
a
lyre
were
upward
swept
by
tongues
of
fire
spreads
in
majesty
over
crag
dale
curved
shore
and
sea
if
this
be
sleep
i
do
not
sleep
i
hear
the
little
woodnote
weep
of
a
shy
darkling
bird
which
cries
in
a
sharp
surprise
at
glimpse
of
me
the
sleeping
nigh
under
her
my
crook
leg
sweeping
some
dream
away
perhaps
awoke
her
for
dew
shook
from
a
bough
doth
soak
her
and
all
elsewhere
how
still
it
is
the
mist
beyond
the
precipice
smokes
gently
up
the
bushes
hang
over
the
gulph
which
i
sprang
last
midnight
though
the
unicorn
who
with
clanged
hooves
and
lowered
horn
raging
pursued
now
hidden
lies
amid
the
cragside
dewberries
and
sweats
his
frosty
flanks
in
sleep
dreaming
he
views
again
my
leap
thrice
hazardous
the
silver
chasm
sighs
and
many
a
blithe
phantasm
turns
in
the
sunlight
quivering
ray
i
couch
in
peace
thoughts
fond
and
gay
feed
on
my
sense
of
maiden
hours
and
earth
refreshed
by
suns
and
showers
of
nightly
dew
and
heavy
though
last
night
rang
with
dinning
riot
dionysos
in
headlong
mood
ranged
through
the
labyrinthine
wood
fleet
maids
sped
yelping
on
with
him
brandishing
a
torn
heifer
limb
dissonant
cymbals
or
black
bowl
of
wine
and
blood
a
wolfish
howl
fled
ululant
with
them
now
there
is
depth
the
white
mist
the
great
sun
peace
too
numb
such
sunshine
let
me
hence
the
out
of
the
solemn
imminence
descent
from
of
yon
chill
spire
whose
shadow
creeps
the
toward
me
from
the
stagnant
deeps
of
the
ravine
for
now
i
will
descend
and
take
again
my
fill
of
fancy
wild
and
musing
joy
such
as
each
dawn
brings
to
alloy
the
long
affliction
of
a
spirit
who
a
complete
world
did
inherit
and
feels
it
crumbling
i
will
down
whither
twin
bluffs
of
sheer
stone
frown
over
sunk
seas
of
billowing
pine
terrace
on
terrace
line
on
line
below
whose
heads
the
broad
downs
slope
away
away
till
senses
grope
at
something
rather
felt
than
seen
the
sea
not
but
a
sheen
under
the
dazed
and
distant
sky
curled
on
a
let
me
lie
for
yonder
hap
a
breeze
is
blowing
and
the
sun
first
gleam
is
showing
under
far
wreckage
since
our
height
inherits
day
while
yet
their
light
quakes
gold
under
the
low
clouds
rift
down
then
miraculously
swift
these
limbs
the
gods
have
given
me
couched
mid
the
gorse
anon
i
see
opposing
this
my
bluff
the
face
of
the
sheer
rock
and
it
trace
a
sill
scarce
ample
for
a
goat
yet
midway
in
the
note
a
cave
mouth
which
thick
creepers
hide
fallen
in
a
silvery
tide
from
a
slant
crevice
overhead
and
lo
the
creeper
stirs
is
shed
and
all
falls
quiet
till
at
last
issues
a
voice
deep
young
and
vast
ii
up
the
ag
centaurs
lie
yet
sleeping
while
crouch
i
palled
of
this
cavern
lair
the
and
watch
the
stretched
sweeping
morning
song
down
the
drizzling
air
the
too
will
now
be
waking
if
they
have
not
played
across
the
moonlight
sets
me
aching
longing
and
slinking
half
afraid
down
the
feathery
tawny
sand
on
sighing
tread
deep
into
banks
of
glistering
shell
to
halt
in
dread
lest
my
break
the
spell
of
the
that
swell
from
the
dim
shoals
toward
the
land
but
this
morn
the
breeze
is
blowing
freshly
i
hear
lightly
flowing
from
the
bending
giant
beam
bars
the
forehead
of
our
door
the
golden
raindrops
in
a
stream
pattering
on
the
steamy
floor
it
is
the
centaur
voice
i
hear
young
and
lusty
deep
and
clear
and
the
panisks
at
his
voice
in
their
fastnesses
rejoice
emerging
from
the
creviced
crag
or
cave
beneath
the
mountain
jag
merry
shaggy
light
of
hoof
to
run
along
the
narrow
roof
and
upon
the
shelvèd
height
dance
before
the
swimming
light
and
i
see
upon
the
ledge
astir
over
the
hanging
edge
the
a
russet
briar
cold
with
dew
morning
song
and
beyond
forlornly
pent
in
a
grey
cloud
gliding
rent
a
pure
pool
of
the
brightest
blue
so
near
it
seems
i
but
to
cast
a
flint
out
on
the
forward
vast
to
mark
it
flashing
blithely
through
and
now
at
last
at
last
the
great
sun
the
sudden
one
stamps
upon
the
cloudy
floor
the
heavens
are
split
and
through
the
floor
heaven
golden
treasures
tumbling
pour
and
the
sun
himself
divine
doth
descend
in
such
a
bursting
blaze
of
shine
that
his
glorious
hair
is
shook
over
the
wide
world
craggiest
end
and
even
i
i
dare
not
look
i
will
shout
i
will
ramp
just
three
bounds
then
out
and
stamp
where
the
air
like
water
is
eddying
up
over
the
precipice
wind
with
an
edge
to
it
blowing
from
the
canyon
race
where
the
dripping
heaves
through
a
tunnel
of
the
rocks
up
in
thunderous
sheaves
against
the
precipitous
to
whip
from
off
th
shocks
bursts
of
mist
which
soak
the
leaves
of
each
scented
bush
that
cleaves
to
the
cliffs
till
fauns
and
lapiths
dance
in
the
brakes
till
even
flushed
silenus
wakes
and
with
a
short
troll
to
the
wind
and
to
the
wine
both
delirious
both
divine
starts
as
he
drains
the
tilted
bowl
at
din
to
rolling
uproar
grown
of
rocks
dislodged
and
bounding
down
with
splinter
of
pines
and
flashes
from
the
ridge
whereon
we
dance
in
a
loud
exuberance
of
rattling
hoofs
whose
echoes
drown
the
squealing
joy
or
reedy
pining
of
pan
pipe
where
pan
reclining
plays
in
the
clouded
mountain

iii
it
is
the
centaur
voice

before
a
hand
the

o

the
centaur
stand
with
ruggëd
head
erect
and
proud
whose
rounded
mouth
yet
chants
aloud
the
joy
of
mind
fulfilled
in

glory
of

hail
thou
the
of

hill
hail
thou
upon

fresh
dews
when
mid
majestic
night
thou
pacest
hid
along
the
height
thine
are
the
solitudes
of
snow
between
bare
peaks
thy
hooves
also
are
heard
within
the
dusk
defile
where
titans
of
a
sunless
while
fashioned
huge
sphinxes
in
whose
eyes
the
kite
now
skulks
or
girding
cries
thine
too
the

and
sinking
pine
burned
by
the
sunset
ay
and
thine
the
ledges
whence
a
sudden
sift
of
snow
sighs
downward
thine
the
swift
uproar
of
avalanche
and
all
the
mountain
echoes
to
thee
call
when
the
snow
melts
and
there
are
seen
crocuses
blazing
mid
the
green
of
the
dewed
grass
the
sylvan
folk
the
dryads
from
the
leafless
oak
or
budded
elder
that
at
length
thou
mayst
release
them
by
the
strength
of
thy
tough
fingers

on
thee
the

the

of

sun
sith

thou

all

of
deep

hail
then
whom
earth

hails
and
ocean
whose
whales

serpents
that

swinging
their
gold
crests
to
the
skies
to

thy

thy

the

sweats
upon
my

the

my

golden
swims
over
my
flushed

fervid
limbs
i
feel
in
me
my
spirit
rise
flogging
up
tall
skies
now
is
the
morning
of
the
world
and
through
my
heart
a
flood
is
hurled
of
onerous
joyance
of
desire
to
clutch
the
sun
and
spill
its
fire
down
heaven
blue
bulwarks
to
snatch
life
and
drain
its
lusty
full
in
strife
of
all
my
body
with
the
bent
wrestle
of
every
element
close
with
the
whirlwind
front
the
tide
and
turn
its
moony
press
aside
but
in
the
world
i
can
not
find
a
match
in
strength
a
foe
in
mind
at
dawn
at
eve
the
waters
burn
all
night
the
constellations
turn
round
the
dark
pole
and
none
knows
why
none
seeks
to
know
save
only
i
and
thou
o
faun
we
are
alone
yet
sometimes
when
the
wind
is
gone
and
all
below
shines
sunned
and
still
i
feel
depart
from
me
the
will
merely
to
know
to
know
and
wait
i
would
do
more
i
would
create
though
what
i
know
not
but
i
would
spend
this
my
mind
and
hardihood
yet
find
no
means
save
physic
force

as
a

stride
as
a

then
stride
i

i
overcome
the

i
all
are
dumb
natheless
my

demands
in
grief
ardour
endurance
and
relief
asks
but
receives
not
shall
not
i
echo
thy
pain
whom
fates
deny
answer
to

as
they
to
thee
the
fill
but
we
accept
too
much
o
sire
best
though
idly
to
fulfil
our
zest
four
leagues
this
canyon
runs
between

the

of

yon

with
me
from

thee
the

away
my
rapping
footfalls
drown
of
the
all
but
the
sobbing
of
the
wind
manner
of
within
my
ears
and
loud
behind
the
the
thunder
of
the
centaur
hooves
where
like
a
hailstorm
down
he
moves
past
me
the
spun

ah
no

my
breath
comes
keener
than
the
frore
indraught
of
mountain
frost
my
head
turns
dizzy
feet
are
lost
yet
scamper
feet
a
rock
a
mound

i
soar
it
at
a
bound
on
on
down
down
a
sudden
brook
and
now
in
lo
there
look
laughingly
up
at
me
the
eyes
of
hyads
and
their
fading
cries
ring
in
my
ears
can
they
have
seen
the
centaur
hurtle
by
between
them
and
the
clouds
the
downs
now
earth
bowl
rocks
and
reels
the
sky
and
through
my
chilly
flaming
tears
the
molten
sun
swoops
bursts
and
veers
still
rap
my
hoofs
though
but
the
sound
tells
me
they
yet
rocket
the

the
uproar
loudens
more
behind
my
crook
legs
cross
my
eyes
go
blind
i
claw
the

i
can
scarce
lurch
i
feel
the
sudden
fan
of
the
great
centaur
galey
breath
upon
my
nape
and
like
chill
death
his
hand
descends
but
ah
he
laughs
even
as
bacchus
when
he
quaffs
in
jest
or
taunt
a
double
bowl
i
choking
reel
and

wildly
aside

as
i
fall
a
rampant

majestical
storms

storming
swings

across
rushing
lyre
which
rings
to
strains

an

by
the
shadows
of
the
great
clouds
throng
across
their

a
noiseless
rout
sometimes
a
peewit
blown
about
by
airy
surge
cries
a
lone
cry
ere
hurtled
down
the
clarid
sky
sometimes
is
heard
a
shepherd
voice
shouting
and
after
it
the
noise
of
crowded
sheep
herded
within
the
gay
dog
keep
who
also
barking
shouts

these
nought
breaks
the

ix
seaward
my

way
i
take
the
and
at
a

lit
quietude
slake
journey
to
the
my
thirst
and
feel
a
dull
flame
creep
like
the

flux
of
tidal
sleep
through
all
my

yet
when
i
sink
sleepward
start
up
to
drink
the

wood
wet
deliciousness
touch
flowers
and
feel
the
sun
caress
about
my
locks
and
wander
on
or
pause
to
smile
up
at
the
sun
guarding
my
eyes
with
glowing
hand
or
leaned
against
a
stand
watching
between
the
branches
rift
as
they
gently
wave
and
lift
to
the
bland
breeze
softly
blowing
the
noiseless
clouds
serenely
going
slowly
to
the
hid
low
sea
i
can
hear
breathing
slumberously
till
from
the
woodland
i
emerge
greeted
by
a
louder
surge
and
from
the
bushy
spy
how
the
hollow
bay
doth
lie
one
quiver
and
murmur
under
the
sun
and
how
the
lightsome
run
chasing
each
other
crookedly
over
the
idly
heaving
sea
next
i
will
turn
my
eyes
perhaps
the
to
where
the
languid
waters
lapse
glittering
over
a
sunburned
rock
round
which
the
shrieking
white
gulls
flock
thus
browsing
in
my
solitude
i
may
remember
i
a
feud
with
the
once
who
drave
me
from
the
of
their
cave
enough
and
crashing
down
i
come
to
find
them
drowsing
in
their
home
so
creep
i
with
a
crooked
stick
to
where
a
blinding
pool
is
quick
with
green
electric
sprawling
across
a
rock
which
bakes
i
stir
the
molten
till
they
boil
and
up
my
hawthorn
kick
and
coil
then
scamper
rocketing
to
the
cave
hurl
the
stick
in
hark
how
they
rave
and
plunge
up
clattering
kicking
neighing
till
triton
on
his
horn
braying
and
each
hasteneth
to
belabour
with
hooves
or
tear
with
teeth
his
neighbour
and
from
the
cavern
blueness
rush
into
the
simmering
beach
hush
to
stand
with
heaving
flanks
agaze
at
the
hot
stones
and
still
sea
blaze
then
stampede
scattering
high
and
wide
a
hail
of
stones
and
glittering
tide
x
i
will
walk
the
sunny
wood
the
faun
deep
and
tranquil
as
my
mood
in
his
and
watch
how
the
honeyed
sunlight
is
hung
in
the
great
boughs
of
the
trees
and
the
pattern
the
branchwork
weaves
under
the
panoply
of
leaves
and
how
high
up
two
butterflies
pass
vaulting
out
into
the
skies
or
entering
a
silent
glade
draw
a
sharp
breath
and
stand
dismayed
at
beauty
which
doth
straight
present
such
a
spasm
of
ravishment
sight
is
confused
and
doth
confess
her
wreck
in
voiceless
tenderness
seeing
the
unruffled
ever
by
any
breeze
unburned
by
bright
dawn
fiery
chill
standing
celestially
still
or
lay
me
down
chestnut
boughs
and
drowse
and
dream
and
dream
and
drowse
drunk
with
the
greenness
overhead
until
a
blossom
of
sharp
red
shook
from
her
high
and
scalding
place
splash
with
chill
scent
my
upturned
face
xi
but
lo
amid
the
woodland
green
the
what
mantles
of
strange
blue
are
seen
what
sage
is
he
who
slowly
leads
disciples
on
and
little
heeds
the
holiness
of
sylvan
haunt
where
even
the
silver
bird
dare
chant
but
seldom
where
the
sunlight
lies
here
scalding
gold
and
yonder
dies
into
a
humid
still
green
gloom
hath
not
he
in
the
forum
room
to
vent
himself
that
now
with
rude
rabble
he
scareth
solitude
from
her
ultimate
now
steps
he
forward
a
slow
pace
and
his
discourse
hear
him
prate
o
woods
to
silence
consecrate
hear
him
o
flowers
whose
golden
eyes
speak
more
than
all
man
meanwhile
though
nations
in
distress
cower
at
a
comet
loveliness
his
shaken
across
the
midnight
sky
though
the
wind
roars
and
victory
a
virgin
fierce
on
vans
of
gold
stoops
through
the
cloud
white
smother
rolled
over
the
armies

and
flow
across
the
broad
green
hills

circle
down
to
cast

the
leafy
crown
though
men
drive
galleys
golden
beaks
to
isles
beyond
the
sunset
peaks
and
cities
on
the
sea
behold
whose
walls
are
glass
whose
gates
are
gold
whose
turrets
risen
in
an
hour
dazzle
between
the
sun
and
shower
whose
sole
inhabitants
are
kings
six
cubits
high
with
gryphon
wings
and
beard
and
mien
more
glorious
than
midas
or
assaracus
though
priests
in
many
a
fane
lift
anguished
hands
and
lift
in
vain
toward
the
sun
shaft
dancing
through
the
bright
roof
square
of
blue
though
the
stars
nightly
arise
the
silver
fumes
of
sacrifice
though
a
new
helen
bring
new
scars
pyres
piled
upon
wrecked
golden
cars
stacked
spears
rolled
smoke
and
spirits
sped
like
a
streaked
flame
toward
the
dead
though
all
these
be
yet
grows
not
old
delight
of
sunned
and
windy
wold
of
soaking
downs
aglare
asteam
of
still
tarns
where
the
yellow
gleam
of
a
far
sunrise
slowly
breaks
or
sunset
strews
with
golden
flakes
the
deeps
which
soon
the
stars
will
throng
for
earth
yet
keeps
her
undersong
of
comfort
and
of
ultimate
peace
that
whoso
seeks
shall
never
cease
to
hear
at
dawn
or
noon
or
night
joys
hath
she
too
joys
thin
and
bright
too
thin
too
bright
for
those
to
hear
who
listen
with
an
eager
ear
or
course
about
and
seek
to
spy
within
an
hour
eternity
first
must
the
spirit
cast
aside
this
world
and
next
his
own
poor
pride
and
learn
the
universe
to
scan
more
as
a
flower
less
as
a
man
then
shall
he
hear
the
lonely
dead
sing
and
the
stars
sing
overhead
and
every
spray
upon
the
heath
and
larks
above
and
ants
beneath
the
stream
shall
take
him
in
her
arms
blue
skies
shall
rest
him
in
their
calms
the
wind
shall
be
a
lovely
friend
and
every
leaf
and
bough
shall
bend
over
him
with
a
lover
grace
the
hills
shall
bare
a
perfect
face
full
of
a
high
solemnity
the
heavenly
clouds
shall
weep
and
be
content
as
overhead
they
swim
to
be
high
brothers
unto
him
no
more
shall
he
feel
pitched
and
hurled
uncomprehended
into
this
world
for
every
place
shall
be
his
place
and
he
shall
recognize
its
face
at
dawn
he
shall
upon
his
path
no
sword
shall
touch
him
nor
the
wrath
of
the
ranked
crowd
of
clamorous
men
at
even
he
shall
home
again
and
lay
him
down
to
sleep
at
ease
one
with
the
night
and
the
night
peace
sorrow
to
be
escaped
of
none
but
a
more
deep
communion
shall
be
to
him
and
death
at
last
no
more
dreaded
than
the
past
whose
shadow
in
the
brain
of
earth
informs
him
now
and
gave
him
birth
up

a
man

dares
affront
the
great

ever
the
lamb
cry
as
the
bird
descends
upon
its
helpless
head
to
pluck
its
eyes
out

with
dread

he
press
in
stumbling
haste
over
the
wide
moor

waste

stripped
to
plunge

never

the
sunned
pool

treacherously

terror
in
his
heart

him

he
draws
apart

murmuring
tune

from
a
lyre

i
mid
a
thicket
where
the
spicy
warms
the
air
with
giddy
scent

for
an
hour
woos
with
her
flower
the
full
gaze
of
her
lord
the
sun
and
through
whose
thorns
the
sunbeams
run
spangling
the
cavern
of
the
brake
with
chequered
shade
such
as
the
snake
loves
to
repose
in
that
the
heat
upon
his
sullen
coils
may
beat
breeding
within
his
ancient
heart
such
malice
that
his
tongue
must
dart
flickering
in
silence
out
and
in
the
while
adown
his
withered
skin
from
horns
above
his
murderous
eyes

cold
surge

ebbs
and
dies

yon
comes
with
solemn
head

about

seizes
me

shake
as
gently
as
an
unseen
snake
swinging
toward
him

he
stands

and
unclasps
his

a
spot
the
spring

to
the
sound

water
sighing
frequent
haunt
the
naiads
when
the
sun
is
lying
of
the
lonely
heavy
on
mead

fronded
tree
when
birds
are
silent
and
the
bee
swoons
in
the
dewed
heart
of
the
rose

hushedly
i
will
repose
upon
its
banks
and
to
the
spring
an
answer
make
with
hands
that
cling
over
this
lost
lyre
murmurous
chords
and
with
their
voiced
quiet
mingle
words
such
as
my
shrouded
soul
affords
when
the
warm
blood
within
my
veins
throbs
heavily
and
the
noon
sun
reigns
who
would
heaven
and
earth
unite
in

arduous
light

bronzed

come
ye
sorrowful
and
steep
your
tired
brows
in
a
nectarous
sleep
the
for
our

lightlier

music
than
the
traceries
of
the
sun
by
the
lolling
water
cast
up
grey
precipices
vast
lifting
smooth
and
warm
and
steep
out
of
the
palely
shimmering
deep
come
ye
sorrowful
and
take
kisses
that
are
but
half
awake
for
here
are
eyes
o
softer
far
than
the
blossom
of
the
star
upon
the
mothy
twilit
waters
and
here
are
mouths
whose
gentle
laughters
are
but
the
echoes
of
the
deep
laughing
and
murmuring
in
its
sleep
come
ye
sorrowful
and
see
the
raindrops
flaming
goldenly
on
the
stream
eddies
overhead
and
dragonflies
with
drops
of
red
in
the
crisp
surface
of
each
wing
threading
slant
rains
that
flash
and
sing
or
under
the
cup
from
darkling
depths
roll
slowly
up
the
bronze
flanks
of
an
ancient
bream
into
the
hot
sun
shattered
beam
or
over
a
sunk
tree
bubbled
bole
the
perch
stream
in
a
golden
shoal
come
ye
sorrowful
our
deep
holds
dreams
lovelier
than
sleep
but
if
ye
sons
of
sorrow
come
only
wishing
to
be
numb
our
eyes
are
sad
as
bluebell
posies
our
breasts
are
soft
as
silken
roses
and
our
hands
are
tenderer
than
the
breaths
that
scarce
can
stir
the
sunlit
eglantine
that
is
murmurous
with
hidden
bees
come
ye
sorrowful
and
steep
your
tired
brows
in
a
nectarous
sleep
come
ye
sorrowful
for
here
no
voices
sound
but
fond
and
clear
of
mouths
as
lorn
as
is
the
rose
that
under
water
doth
disclose
amid
her
crimson
petals
torn
a
heart
as
golden
as
the
morn
and
here
are
tresses
languorous
as
the
weeds
wander
over
us
and
brows
as
holy
and
as
bland
as
the
sand
lying
below
the
lazy
water
limpid
flow

ye
sorrowful
and

your
tired
brows
in

there
can
sound
to
on
the
lull

the
first
profound
few
murmurs
of
my
lyre
grave
strings
a
voice
uprises
who
now
sings
the
noon
and
his
own
tristfulness
a
slim
youth
in
a
shepherd
dress
yet
without
sheep
who
careless
lies
upon
the
hill
his
shepherd
guise
tokens
perhaps
a
poet

which
joys
in
wandering
apart
from
the
dinned
ways
where
chariots
roll
from
the
shrill
sophist
with
his
shoal
of
gapers
from
the
angry
mart
from
the
full
eyes
and
empty
heart
of
babbling
women
from
the
neat
aridity
of
paven
street
a
heart
that
wandering
musing
sings
the
joy

of
simple
things
the
earth

still
only
the
white
sun
climbs
through
the
green
silence
of
the
branching
limes

in
whose
linked
flowers
hanging
from
the
still
arcadia
distil
their
soundless
syrup
drop
by
drop

the

bracket
of
their
lips
the
black
bee
drowsing
floats
and
drowsing
sips

on

with
the
murmurous
rumour

with
open

to
sink
and
swoon
in
the

nothing
moves

smiles
and
loves

quivering
peace

on
the

gloam
butterflies

white
and
hot

only
to
where
they
can
float
flat
and
dream
on
the

asleep
beautiful
slumbrous
trees
stirred
only
by
the
passion

the
breeze

like

wave
welling
over
rocks
loosens
and
lifts
the
mass

drowsing
locks

heaves
her

the
dust
cries
to
the

over

the

twin
reeds

like
drops
from

bleeds
a
yokel
pipe
an

broods
such
quiet
and
glamour
as
must
be
beneath
the
threshing
upper
sea
here
burns
no
sun

tawny
light
pervades
the
vistas
still
and
bright
of
mazy
boles
and
fallen

i
press

on
at

there
cleaves
the
twilit
hush
a
pillared
gleam
the

is
a
beam
of
sunlight
fallen
in
a
dell
beyond
the

there
will
i
dwell
soothed
by
sunned
quietude
for
there
a
carved
rock
spouts
and
moists
the
air
with
pour
and
rising
spray

hark
what
festive
cries
are
they
the
which
greet
me
as
i

satyrs

the

into

i
slowly
about

then
musing
i
will
on

so
stray
to
where
a
silver
slow
river
circles
through
the
meads
wherein
the
mooching
great
ox
feeds
and
turns
a
slow
eye
round
the

wondering
if
he
can
ever
die

there
mayhap
come
to

i
hear
a

voice
in

and
yet
shall
mark
no
singer
nigh
till
gently
peering
i
espy
a
solemn
elfish
child
who
sits
unseen
mid
towering
grass
and
knits
an
endless
endless
daisy

crooning
the
while
some
soft
refrain
her
mother
sings
her
when
she
closes
her
twilit

three

red
roses
one
each
for

the
reddest

oh
none
for

some
day
when
she
grows
up
a
red
rose
will
be
then
mid

will
sink
down
laugh
low

greet
converse
with
her
blue
inquiring
childish
eyes
a
small
with

sharp
merry
brown

tell
her
tales

flew
on

give
to

the

change
him

thus
will
i
sit

both
amuse
until
i
rise

beg
excuse
off

ask

why
one

of

shoon
she
left
us
last
night
in

not
her

no

back

neither

to

desiring
nought
but
aye
to
see
the

i
a

meet

persuades
me
to
the
broadest
of
the
glades

smooth
and
sunken
space
the
far
woods
lie
for
in
this
place
deserted

for
a
of

bower
of
the

should
the

chance
nymphs

and
sylvans
join
in
dance
xvii
on
either
hand
the
slender
trees
the
immortal
bow
to
the
caressing
breeze
and
shake
their
shocks
of
silver
light
against
skies
marbled
save
where
within
a
rent
of
blue
the
tilted
slip
of
moon
glints
through
glittering
upon
us
as
we
dance
with
a
soft
extravagance
of
limbs
as
blonde
as
autumn
boughs
and
gold
locks
floating
from
moony
brows
while
anguished
pan
the
pipes
doth
blow
fond
and
tremulous
and
low
and
anon
the
timbrel
shakes
it
is
his
sudden
heart
that
breaks
for
springs
before
the
world
grew
old
rich
vales
and
fiery
cold
he
watches
the
scarce
moving
skies
the
trees
the
glittering
revelries
the
moon
the
dancers
the
world
fantastical
and
sad
the
timbrels
pulse
and
knock
we
follow
in
a
dancing
flock
touching
each
other
while
from
between
our
parted
lips
the
solemn
melodies
repeat
the
rhythm
of
our
shaken
feet
then
faster
and
the
round
we
trace
hair
flowing
from
elated
face
eyes
lit
breast
bare
with
lifted
knees
and
hands
that
toss
as
toss
the
trees
and
slow
again
with
cumulate
motion
as
the
long
draw
and
plunge
of
ocean
bursting
in
a
cloud
of
spray
up
a
white
deserted
bay
of
the
green
bermooths
whose
blistering
sands
the
cool
foam
soothes
next
the
bewildering
pipes
may
sing
some
simple
melody
of
spring
whose
cadences
remember
yet
sadly
lost
springs
that
we
forget
to
which
as
dances
april
rain
on
a
still
pool
where
leans
no
stain
save
of
the
cloud
pure
splendour
spread
gloriously
overhead
our
feet
shall
twinkle
and
our
golden
anklets
tinkle
while
fair
arms
in
aery
sleeves
shiver
as
the
poplar
leaves
and
all
the
while
shall
pan
sit
by
and
play
and
pause
perhaps
to
sigh
viewing
the
skies
the
hushed
and
glittering
revelries
the
infant
moon
the
slender
trees
silvering
to
the
shivery
breeze
the
fair
lorn
dancers
the
world
fantastical
and
sad
xviii
thus
may
we
dance
the
light
away
of
yet
one
more
unmemoried
day
but
the
dance
ended
i
will
go
beyond
the
reach
of
pipes
that
blow
a
sadness
thrilling
through
my
veins
for
now
within
my
spirit
reigns
shadow
before
whose
brooding
face
silent
there
trail
on
gliding
pace
a
multitude
of
restless
fears
obscure
griefs
and
obscurer
tears
bewildered
sighs
waned
phantasies
and
all
disastrous
presences
mutely
prophetic
of
a
woe
i
know
not
yet
but
i
shall
know
such
power
pan
grief
hath
to
oppress
and
memory
since
now
i
guess
only
too
well
that
there
must
come
twilight
calamity
and
doom
for
once
i
saw
beneath
an
oak
a
bard
so
aged
it
seemed
he
woke
that
moment
from
a
sleep
of
years
and
in
his
voice
were
sleep
and
tears
till
he
raging
spake
rocking
as
when
woodlands
shake
under
the
first
urge
of
the
wind
whose
roaring
murk
lightens
behind
be
warned
i
feel
the
world
grow
old
and
off
olympus
fades
the
gold
of
the
simple
passionate
sun
and
the
gods
wither
one
by
one
apollo
bow
is
broken
and
throned
zeus
nods
nor
may
be
woken
but
by
the
song
of
spirits
seven
quiring
in
the
midnight
heaven
of
a
new
world
no
more
forlorn
sith
unto
it
a
babe
is
born
that
in
a
propped
thatched
stable
lies
while
with
darkling
reverend
eyes
dusky
emperors
coifed
in
gold
kneel
mid
the
rushy
mire
and
hold
caskets
of
rubies
urns
of
myrrh
whose
fumes
enwrap
the
thurifer
and
coil
toward
the
high
dim
rafters
where
with
lutes
and
warbling
laughters
clustered
cherubs
of
rainbow
feather
fanning
the
fragrant
air
together
flit
in
jubilant
holy
glee
and
make
heavenly
minstrelsy
to
the
child
their
sun
whose
glow
bathes
them
his
cloudlets
from
below
long
shall
this
chimed
accord
be
heard
yet
all
earth
hushed
at
his
first
word
then
shall
be
seen
apollo
car
blaze
headlong
like
a
banished
star
and
the
queen
of
heavenly
loves
dragged
downward
by
her
dying
doves
vulcan
spun
on
a
wheel
shall
track
the
circle
of
the
zodiac
silver
artemis
be
lost
to
the
polar
blizzards
tossed
heaven
shall
curdle
as
with
blood
the
sun
be
swallowed
in
the
flood
the
universe
be
silent
save
for
the
low
drone
of
winds
that
lave
the
shadowed
great
world
ashen
sides
as
through
the
rustling
void
she
glides
then
shall
there
be
a
whisper
heard
of
the
grave
secret
and
its
word
where
in
black
silence
none
shall
cry
save
those
who
spy
how
from
the
murmurous
graveyards
creep
the
figures
of
eternal
sleep
last
when
is
light
men
shall
behold
beyond
the
crags
a
flower
of
gold
blossoming
in
a
golden
haze
and
while
they
guess
zeus
halls
now
blaze
shall
in
the
blossom
heart
descry
the
saints
of
a
new
hierarchy
he
ceased
and
in
the
morning
sky
zeus
anger
threatened
murmurously
i
sped
away
the
lightning
sword
stabbed
on
the
forest
but
the
word
abides
with
me
i
feel
its
power
most
darkly
in
the
twilit
hour
when
night
eternal
shadow
cast
over
earth
hushed
and
pale
and
vast
darkly
foretells
the
soundless
night
in
which
this
orb
so
green
so
bright
now
spins
and
which
shall
compass
her
when
on
her
rondure
nought
shall
stir
but
which
the
wind
shall
roll
from
the
equator
to
the
pole
for
everlastingly
there
is
the
final
something
beyond

i
wis

haunted

there
clings
as
hound

the

warily

a

loose
on

from

stark
affright
famine

the

outlive
the
funeral
change

fall
his
rods
of
viewless
power
upon
that
minute
when
universe
cowers
at
infinite
xix
so
far
my
mind
runs
yet
i
see
how
little
repays
my
heart
would
learn
not
teach
better
laugh
long
lie
suck
a
peach
couched
under
flowers
which
daze
the
low
hot
sun
with
showers
of
fragrance
while
the
dusty
bee
drones
fumbles
falls
luxuriantly
within
their
throats
couched
turn
a
song
of
flowers
all
the
flowers
among
there
is
a
vale
beyond
blue
ida
mount

and
thither
often
would
i
piping
stray
afternoon
to
listen
to
the
music
of
a
fount
song
that
spelt
her
tears
out
in
a
dorian
lay
long
long
ago
she
wept
narcissus
came
wandering
down
the
glade
full
weary
was
he
of
the
lamp
gold
flame
wavering
beneath
the
dusky
colonnade
for
at
the
fall
of
night
forth
from
the
dim
gardens
stole
echo
kneeling
by
his
bed
with
small
sweet
she
importuned
him
who
watched
the
lamp
flame
idle
overhead
dry
was
her
hot
flushed
cheek
and
dark
the
fire
in
her
great
eyes
her
lips
roamed
warm
and
light
over
his
arm
her
murmurs
of
desire
mixed
with
the
many
murmurs
of
the
night
in
vain
he
came
to
rest
and
sing
with
me
and
loll
his
fingers
in
the
liquid
cool
and
drop
slow
tears
slow
tears
luxuriously
into
the
shadowy
motion
of
the
pool
with
tongue
scarce
audible
i
wooed
the
lad
whispering
how
beneath
the
drumming
fall
slumbers
a
rapt
deep
lake
so
blue
so
sad
that
no
fish
swim
it
nor
about
it
call
delighting
birds
from
shore
to
shore
nor
doth
the
nightingale
when
june
begins
and
the
moon
mounts
a
pattin
of
bright
or
hymn
her
long
sorrows
and
her
lord
black
sins
and
the
boy
answered
answered
me
and
mourned
the
loveliness
of
echo
sighed
he
soul
is
fled
and
long
thou
knowest
bourned
in
what
far
dell
none
knoweth
love
but
thee
farest
thither
sweeter
to
my
ears
are
thy
quiet
voices
and
the
gentle
breast
of
rambling
water
sweeter
than
my
dear
then
murmured
i
lower
love
and
rest
there
was
no
sound
through
all
the
sleeping
wood
save
one
sharp
cry
from
echo
who
as
she
followed
from
afar
did
spy
how
to
my
arms
my
lover
downward
slipped
softly
i
rocked
him
down
into
the
pool
shutting
his
ears
to
the
loud
torrents
din
and
kissed
and
bore
him
through
the
portals
cool
and
laid
him
sleeping
the
blue
halls
within
so
i
returned
but
never
to
me
came
another
as
beautiful
nor
shall
come
lonely
i
flow
and
flowing
lisp
his
name
till
the
sky
waste
and
all
the
earth
be
dumb
so
sang
the

i

at

its

laughs

weeps
among

the

their

the

was
hedgëd
about
with

rose

came

cloaked

closed

croaked

evilly
eyeing

lying
which
no

came

cloaked

which
soaked
the
earth
so
that
the
flies
dizzily
swung
over
its
winkless
eyes
and
in
a
crawling
shiny
busy
brood
blackened
the
sticky
blood
and
tickled
the
mouth
that
sought
to
cry
bitterly
and
beseechingly
against
the
judgment
of
th
unflinching
sky
the
poor
dead
lonely
thing
had
not
a
shroud
from
that
still
frightful
glare
until
a
cloud
of
darkness
flowing
like
a
dye
over
the
edges
of
the
sky
browned
and
put
out
the
silent
sun
a
benison
of
three
hours
space
and
it
had
power
to
put
a
shadow
into
that
thing
face
and
th
invisible
birds
fell
silent
by
its
grace
thus
judas
lay
in

and
all
was
still
then
faint
light
like
water
began
again
to
fill
the
sky
and
a
whisper
came
it
from
the
grass
whispering
dry
and
sparse
or
from
the
air
beyond
the
neighbouring
hill
ebbed
as
a
spirit
on
a
sigh
passing
beyond
alarm
is
finished
and
there
was
calm
under
the
empty
tree
and
in
the
brightening
sky
grayshott
four
songs
from
the
prince
of

the
prince
of
ormuz
sings
to
badoura
when
she
kisses
me
with
her
lips
i
become
a
roc
that
giant
that
fabulous
bird
and
over
the
desert
vast
yellow
and
dumb
i
wheel
and
my
jubilant
screaming
is
heard
a
voice
an
echo
high
up
and
glad
over
the
domes
and
green
pools
of
bagdad
but
when
she
kisses
me
with
her
eyes
my
heart
melts
in
me
she
is
my
sun
she
strokes
my
snow
i
am
loosed
i
arise
a
brook
of
water
i
run
i
run
crystal
water
sunny
and
sweet
laughing
and
weeping
to
fawn
at
her
feet

these

lawford
the
gift
of
song
the
gift
of
song
beyond
a
hill
and
a
river
within
a
tower
of
stone
a
princess
by
a
casement
dreamed
sitting
still
alone
her
golden
hair
hung
heavy
over
her
kirtle
green
her
eyes
were
blue
and
lonely
her
tender
mouth
had
been
a
joy
for
splendid
kisses
it
was
so
red
so
red
but
it
was
parted
in
singing
and
beginning
her
song
she
said
three
songs
in
my
spirit
elusive
tremulous
light
if
you
can
feel
their
tremor
this
gift
is
spended
aright
without
in
the
silent
garden
the
sunflowers
dozed
in
the
sun
bees
blackened
their
tawny
faces
their
heads
drooped
one
by
one
amid
a
stilly
hidden
from
sun
and
sight
a
nightingale
sang
over
the
songs
that
rejoice
the
night
and
browsing
upon
sweet
grasses
in
the
fair
solitude
half
in
sun
half
in
shadow
a
lordly
bay
stag
stood
upon
earth
all
was
silent
save
when
the
hid
bird
sung
in
the
dark
blue
afternoon
heavens
a
silent
hung
as
she
commenced
singing
the
nightingale
stopped
in
the
dead
silence
the
leaves
flicked
softly
the
great
stag
turned
his
head
thus
sung
she
alone
and
only
the
stag
the
the
bird
and
pensive
moon
in
the
darkling
heavens
her
lovely
singing
heard
and
as
she
finished
singing
she
bowed
her
golden
head
low
o
low
on
her
shaking
bosom
and
ending
her
song
she
said
three
songs
in
my
spirit
elusive
tremulous
light
you
have
felt
their
tremor
this
gift
is
spended
aright
the
nightingale
lifted
her
voice
up
the
moon
fled
out
of
the
skies
the
split
and
two
tears
rolled
out
of
the
great
stag
eyes
now
when
she
had
done
singing
she
closed
her
eyes
and
her
breath
went
out
as
she
lay
down
backward
and
folded
her
hands
in
death
lyme
regis
fragments
from
a
drama
on
the
subject
of
orestes
warning
unheeded
i
cried
in
the
halls
where
the
feast
will
be
set
the
hurrying
servants
whom
i
met
brushed
me
aside
asked
why
i
tarried
on
their
black
woolly
heads
gold
platters
they
carried
piled
high
with
rich
fruits
betwixt
jewelled
hands
goblets
of
crystal
white
blossoming
wands
urns
breathing
incense
all
these
to
be
set
where
truth
feast
and
the
feasters
too
soon
shall
be
met
the
guest
shall
turn
as
he
laughs
and
sups
reaching
his
hand
for
the
golden
wine
his
face
shall
change
as
he
sees
next
to
him
a
mouth
that
mocks
eyes
that
look
through
him
a
head
sink
her
glistening
brow
the
cups
locks
blackening
his
stoup
with
a
liquor
of
brine
in
the
scrolls
of
the
platter
of
gold
there
has
bled
the
juice
of
fruit
battered
and
hairy
and
red
the
goblets
of
crystal
are
fissured
and
cracked
like
ice
the
bronze
tyre
of
the
chariot
has
wracked
and
the
blossoms
curl
withered
because
of
the
heat
of
urns
overset
by
the
slip
of
red
feet
when
the
reveller
fell
forward
unable
to
save
his
eyes
from
the
torch
his
groin
from
the
glaive
for
truth
rejected
returns
as
pain
under
the
trestles
the
guests
lie
slain
the
curtains
upon
the
gold
cords
pull
heavily
sagging
like
nets
that
are
full
for
curved
in
the
trough
and
propped
in
the
fold
the
red
red
catch
lies
tossed
and
rolled
the
halls
and
corridors
reek
with
the
flood
the
pillars
are
trickled
with
cyphers
of
blood
rent
garlands
lie
trampled
over
the
floors
rusty
footprints
lead
out
through
the
high
bronze
doors
to
the
starlit
night
and
the
whispering
plain
for
truth
rejected
returns
as
pain
i
weep
for
the
ruin
of
a
high
proud
house
moths

the
still
curtains
down
the
throne
runs
a
mouse
the
sun
fades
on

floors
heaped

with

leaves
the

on

rills

brown
clogs
the
peristyle

a
weariness
man

in

where

ye
are

then
out

that
circle
the
bright
blade
ye
dread
back
to
where
hate
your
shameful
priest
prepares
your
bowl
of
blood
your
fleshy
feast
where
in
the
thronged
and
marketplace
ten
thousand
faces
gaze
on
one
pale
face
where
the
lost
victim
feels
the
lonely
ban
of
death
terrific
loosed
by
man
on
man
where
black
blood
froths
where
drives
the
whirring
wheel
where
hands
ears
lips
fall
lopped
of
instant
steel
where
the
intent
and
dazzling
pincher
plies
till
to
the
silent
tortures
anguish
cries
at
once
for
death
and
when
sharp
death
is
given
others
corded
and
swooned
antic
and
sick
are
driven
under
the
axe
whose
sheeny
flash

fall
bids
the
block

beneath

maul

black
song
at

slowly
on
the

no

how
the

but
the
past
seems
twice

soul

and
shudders
in

on
the

stillness
falls
and
a
glare
the
woods
in
darkness
lie
the
fields
are
stretched
and
stare
under
the
empty
sky
vacant
the
ways
of
the
air
along
which
no
birds
fly
only
the
high
sun
flare
spills
on
the
empty
sky
i
lift
my
aching
eyes
from
the
dry
wilderness
across
me
a
peewit
flies
with
gestures
meaningless
mine
are
his
piping
cries
at
this
world
emptiness
in
dorsetshire
cold
and
bare
the
sunlight
drifted
across
the
hill
round
which
the
sea
wind
current
unfathomable
and
chill
from
dawn
to
silver
sunset
poured
now
faint
now
shrill
how
to
comfort
you
share
any
part
even
to
understand
you
too
deep
an
art
yet
i
comfort
you
tear
out
my
heart
do
not
look
on
me
dry
eyes
for
my
sake
do
not
smooth
my
forehead
your
hands
make
me
ache
o
and
turn
away
your
kisses
or
heart
must
break
cold
and
bare
the
sunlight
drifted
across
the
hill
only
the
current
unfathomable
and
chill
heard
such
speech
gather
bewail
itself
fall
still
toward
the
hill
then
zigzagged
one
plover
rocked
for
a
moment
cried
to
love
and
lover
the
top
of
loneliness
ere
he
heeled
over
man

and
other

kiss
kiss
me
and
kiss
again
make
kissing
almost
pain
close
your
fingers
close
on
mine
and
our
grappling
looks
entwine
kiss
again
and
when
that
done
blind
me
with
each
facing
sun
of
your
clear
and
golden
eyes
till
my
spirit
in
me
dies
and
endures
a
long
eclipse
till
rekindled
at
your
lips
from
this
minute
i
pursue
the
intense
idea
that
you
your
you
being
i
would
draw
you
from
obscurity
dusk
maw
into
my
hands
you
are
moth
or
spirit
gnome
or
star
yet
i
would
not
filch
a
part
misty
soul
or
flaming
heart
which
left
but
as
doth
the
snake
a
pale
tissue
i
will
take
and
shut
all
your
sweetness
up
in
the
gold
walls
of
a
cup
sandalled
feet
to
sweeping
hair
soul
brain
body
all
you
are
curled
as
a
mermaid
coiled
in
brine
now
drunk
one
gush
of
giddy
wine
nay
as
a
strange
lump
of
snow
in
my
two
hands
you
shall
go
and
i
bare
my
browny
breast
press
you
there
where
now
you
rest
ay
and
bless
the
frozen
smart
as
you
melt
into
my
heart
come
i
twine
you
round
my
brows
a
defiant
diadem
poets
of
your
light
shall
sing
satraps
by
you
swear
stout
vows
eyeing
my
gem
you
the
emerald
in
my
ring
thus
i
keep
you
night
and
day
since
no
stone
can
run
away
and
might
dare
a
pleasure
splendid
toss
my
ring
into
the
air
watch
it
spinning
heart
suspended
lest
it
slip
me
unaware
fall
clean
through
my
finger
bars
shatter
in
ten
thousand
stars
yet
you
shall
not
be
my
ring
you
shall
not
be
any
thing
crown
or
stone
set
cunningly
time
can
separate
from
me
no
i
find
an
alchemist
with
a
beard
of
cobwebs
grey
and
fired
eyes
like
moonstones
kissed
by
the
last
gold
beam
of
day
and
older
and
gentler
than
a
fish
and
wiser
than
an
elephant
and
when
i
told
him
what
we
wish
bribe
or
force
him
work
our
want
we
two
shall
opposëd
stand
each
touch
other
at
a
slow
pass
of
his
hand
and
a
soft
word
from
his
lip
we
will
incline
smilingly
and
as
drops
together
run
shaking
off
the
he
and
she
close
and
be
forever
one
grayshott
the
blackbird
i
stand
in
a
sunny
garden
a
blackbird
sings
overhead
i
alive
i
a
love
the
sun
shining
and
where
the
man
would
be
dead
blackbird
make
an
ending
of
fluting
that
song
down
your
orange
beak
i
alive
i
a
love
the
sun
shining
and
i
am
the
man
you
seek
stamford
change
behold
the
tides
are
awake
under
the
high
moon
light
broad
bands
of
silver
they
glitter
and
quake
moving
out
into
the
night
off
from
the
shore
they
slide
out
out
into
the
blue
and
i
am
turned
to
a
shimmering
tide
flooding
on
outward
to
you
hengistbury
head
transfiguration
two
feet
apart
on
the
heathered
hill
we
lie
under
the
wavering
haze
of
the
sun
even
as
two
logs
that
lie
still
in
the
heart
of
a
blaze
side
by
side
we
lie
through
the
long
late
noon
together
on
us
the
light
wind
stoops
his
strong
hot
sweet
scents
of
heather
no
word
breaks
the
air
that
smothers
lest
we
miss
the
dull
of
the
earth
below
each
other
and
the
soft
kiss
of
breathless
heather
upon
heather
while
the
sun
beats
on
us
encouraging
the
swiftening
blood
till
up
the
limbs
and
through
the
ears
it
run
a
thin
red
singing
flood
love
hath
put
in
me
might
that
was
so
weak
i
am
strong
with
light
my
senses
seek
something
indefinable
afar
they
go
wandering
and
return
with
the
light
drunk
off
a
star
they
calmly
burn
even
as
the
immense
sun
burns
on
us
till
evening
turns
watery
those
beams
of
his
and
rising
from
that
joyance
onerous
i
stoop
a
kiss
lighter
than
the
balls
of
fluff
the
wind
sways
across
the
heath
though
each
invisible
hot
puff
scarce
rocks
a
spray
beneath
i
sit
and
it
is
so
still
now
wind
and
sun
have
gone
home
i
can
almost
hear
distil
the
dew
in
the
gloam
and
from
the
clear
and
cool
of
the
twilit
air
that
is
still
as
a
pool
iced
over
and
bare
i
catch
at
length
the
thought
i
have
been
searching
for
did
i
absorb
the
sun
or
just
your
strength
or
something
more
plaint
of
pierrot
i
am
pierrot
and
was
born
on
some
february
morn
when
through
glistering
rain
shone
down
the
full
moon
on
paris
town
ah
the
moonshine
in
my
head
for
upon
the
fatal
minute
when
the
moon
heart
changes
in
it
and
the
tides
their
flow
reverse
i
for
better
or
for
worse
born
was
better
been
born
dead
than
with
moonwork
in
my
head
clown
stood
foster
but
another
got
me
of
clown
wife
my
mother
and
as
suited
my
poor
station
thieving
was
made
my
profession
doorsteps
often
were
my
bed
frosty
moonshine
in
my
head
yet
while
pierrot
was
a
thief
miracle
beyond
belief
chance
fantastic
as
divine
i
fell
in
with
columbine
dark
eyes
lips
of
mournful
red
moonshine
in
my
head
at
the
corner
of
the
street
she
and
i
by
night
would
meet
met
but
never
told
our
love
while
th
ironic
moon
above
in
her
reverie
smiled
and
shed
tranquil
radiance
round
each
head
till
my
father
by
a
breath
stifled
at
the
hands
of
death
since
no
other
children
were
assigned
me
as
only
heir
silver
sequins
heaped
and
spread
billowing
silver
in
my
head
so
in
search
of
fitting
knowledge
poor
pierrot
was
sent
to
college
where
pantaloon
and
pantaloon
in
answerless
riddles
o
the
moon
crammed
more
moonshine
in
his
head
home
then
pierrot
hurried
spent
resolved
to
sigh
headache
heartache
and
the
rest
out
on
columbine
white
breast
white
as
the
moon
cloudy
bed
hush
the
moonshine
in
my
head
but
while
gone
had
entered
in
spangled
smiling
harlequin
laughter
cynic
and
unholy
pah
pierrot
poor
melancholy
turned
but
not
a
word
i
said

the

nearing

in

passed
from

flight

silently
broke
on

turned
a
rose

enwreathed
ruddy
light
and
like
men
smit
of

foes
the
guards
fell
at

possessed

turning
round

fledged
amid
her
fluid
rings
my
soul
began
to
rouse
and
slowly
beat
her
silver
wings
within
her
darkened
house
then
with
vans
lifted
up
for
flight
with
stretched
and
fiery
crest
upward
she
leaped
toward
the
light
and
drew
from
out
my
breast
how
long
i
lay
while
she
was
fled
and
on
the
cliff
below
my
body
lay
stiff
dark
and
dead
i
knew
not
nor
may
know
but
long
it
seemed
sped
beyond
sight
my
soul
enjoyed
release
beyond
the
clouds
within
the
light
she
entered
into
peace
amid
a
world
of
men
how
often
must
i
cry
happy

never
was

then
nor
shall
be

none
marked
it

it

the
green
bough
soaking
still
against
a
sky
washed
clean
after
the
rain
to
watch
the
rapturous
rainbow
flame
and
fly
into
the
gloom
where
drops
fall
goldenly
and
in
my
heart
to
feel
the
end
of
pain
the
end
of
pain
the
late
the
long
expected
to
see
the
skies
clear
in
a
sudden
minute
the
grey
disparting
on
the
blue
within
it
and
on
the
low
far
sea
the
clouds
collected
in
that
deep
quiet
die
to
all
has
been
to
be
renewed
to
bud
to
flower
again
my
second
spring
whose
hope
was
nigh
rejected
before
i
go
hence
and
am
no
more
seen
to
hear
the

ring
out
gay
and
bold
the
low
renewal
of
the
ringdove
moan
from
among
high
sheltered
boughs
and
ceaseless
fall
pitter
pitter
patter
a
dribble
of
gold
from
leaves
nodding
each
on
the
other
one
the
hush
calm
piping
and
the
slow
sweet
mood
to
drink
the
ripe
warm
scent
of
soaking
matter
wet
grass
wet
leaves
wet
wood
wet
mould
the
saddest
and
the
grandest
scent
of
all
so
when
my
dying
eyes
have
loved
the
trees
till
with
huge
tears
turned
blind
when
the
vague
ears
for
the
last
time
have
hearkened
to
the
cool
stir
of
the
long
evening
breeze
the
blackbird
tireless
call
having
drunk
deep
of
strong
and
kind
come
then
o
death
and
let
my
day
be
darkened
i
shall
have
had
my
