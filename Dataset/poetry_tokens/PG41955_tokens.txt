preface
with
deep
reverence
i
inscribe
these
lines
my
dear
parents
to
you
i
see
you
now
away
beyond
the
seas
beyond
the
lands
where
the
sun
goes
down
in
the
pacific
like
some
great
ship
of
fire
resting
still
on
the
green
hills
watching
your
herds
waiting
where
rolls
the
oregon
and
hears
no
sound
save
its
own
dashing
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
century
ago
you
took
me
the
long
and
lonesome
journey
across
the
mighty
continent
wild
and
rent
and
broken
up
and
sown
with
sand
and
ashes
and
crossed
by
tumbling
wooded
rivers
that
ran
as
if
glad
to
get
away
fresh
and
strange
and
new
as
if
but
from
the
hand
of
god
all
the
time
as
i
tread
this
strange
land
i
those
scenes
and
you
are
with
me
how
dark
and
deep
how
sullen
strong
and
the
mighty
missouri
rolled
between
his
walls
of
untracked
wood
and
cleft
the
unknown
domain
of
the
middle
world
before
us
then
the
frail
and
buffeted
rafts
on
the
river
the
women
and
children
huddled
together
the
shouts
of
the
brawny
men
as
they
swam
with
the
bellowing
cattle
the
cows
in
the
stormy
stream
eddying
whirling
spinning
about
calling
to
their
young
their
bright
horns
shining
in
the
sun
the
wild
men
waiting
on
the
other
side
painted
savages
leaning
silent
on
their
bows
despising
our
weakness
opening
a
way
letting
us
pass
on
to
the
unknown
distances
where
they
said
the
sun
and
moon
lay
down
together
and
brought
forth
the
stars
the
long
and
winding
lines
of
wagons
the
graves
by
the
wayside
the
women
weeping
together
as
they
passed
on
then
hills
then
plains
parched
lands
like
syria
dust
and
ashes
and
alkali
cool
streams
with
woods
camps
by
night
great
wood
fires
in
circles
tents
in
the
centre
like
cæsar
painted
men
that
passed
like
shadows
showers
of
arrows
the
wild
beasts
howling
from
the
hill
you
my
dear
parents
will
pardon
the
thread
of
fiction
on
which
i
have
strung
these
scenes
and
descriptions
of
a
mighty
land
of
mystery
and
wild
and
savage
grandeur
for
the
world
will
have
its
way
and
like
a
spoiled
child
demands
a
tale
yea
we
who
toil
and
earn
our
bread
still
have
our
masters
a
ragged
and
broken
story
it
is
with
long
deserts
with
alkali
and
ashes
yet
it
may
like
the
land
it
deals
of
have
some
green
places
and
woods
and
running
waters
where
you
can
rest
three
times
now
i
have
ranged
the
great
west
in
fancy
as
i
did
in
fact
for
twenty
years
and
gathered
unknown
and
unnamed
blossoms
from
from
desert
level
where
man
never
ranged
before
and
asked
the
world
to
receive
my
weeds
my
grasses
and
blossoms
but
here
it
ends
good
or
bad
i
have
done
enough
of
this
work
on
the
border
the
orient
promises
a
more
grateful
harvest
i
have
been
true
to
my
west
she
has
been
my
only
love
i
have
remembered
her
greatness
i
have
done
my
work
to
show
to
the
world
her
vastness
her
riches
her
resources
her
valor
and
her
dignity
her
poetry
and
her
grandeur
yet
while
i
was
going
on
working
so
in
silence
what
were
the
things
she
said
of
me
but
let
that
pass
my
dear
parents
others
will
come
after
us
possibly
i
have
blazed
out
the
trail
for
great
minds
over
this
field
as
you
did
across
the
deserts
and
plains
for
great
men

by
arizona
sea
of
sand
some
bearded
miners
gray
and
old
and
resolute
in
search
of
gold
sat
down
to
tap
the
savage
land
they
tented
in
a
canñon
mouth
that
gaped
against
the
warm
wide
south
and
underneath
a
wall
where
now
nor
rains
nor
winds
may
fall
they
delved
the
level
sands
for
gold
with
bold
and
hornéd
hands
a
miner
stood
beside
his
mine
he
pull
his
beard
then
look
away
across
the
level
sea
of
sand
beneath
his
broad
and
hairy
hand
a
hand
as
hard
as
knots
of
pine
it
looks
so
like
a
sea
said
he
he
pull
his
beard
and
he
did
say
it
looks
just
like
a
sea
again
he
pull
that
beard
of
his
but
said
no
other
thing
than
this
a
stalwart
miner
dealt
a
stroke
and
struck
a
buried
beam
of
oak
an
old
ship
beam
the
shaft
appear
with
faded
the
miner
twisted
twirled
his
beard
lean
on
his
as
he
spoke
is
from
some
ship
he
said
some
laden
ship
of
solomon
that
sail
these
lonesome
seas
upon
in
search
of
ophir
mine
ah
me
that
sail
this
desert
sea
nay
nay
is
not
a
tale
of
gold
but
ghostly
land
and
old
iii
but
this
the
tale
along
a
wide
and
sounding
stream
some
silent
braves
that
stole
along
the
farther
side
through
sweeping
wood
that
swept
the
waves
like
long
arms
reach
across
the
tide
kept
watch
and
ward
and
still
defied
a
low
black
boat
that
hugg
the
shores
an
ugly
boat
an
ugly
crew
and
slaves
that
bow
that
bent
the
oars
that
cleft
the
murky
waters
through
that
climb
the
swift
missouri
waves
the
surly
slaves
a
grand
old
neptune
in
the
prow
and
white
with
touch
of
time
yet
strong
as
in
his
middle
prime
a
grizzled
king
i
see
him
now
with
beard
as
blown
by
wind
of
seas
and
wild
and
white
as
white
stand
up
turn
suddenly
look
back
along
the
low
boat
wrinkled
track
then
fold
his
mantle
round
a
form
as
any
hercules
and
so
sit
silently
beside
the
grim
old
sits
his
bride
a
blossom
rudely
torn
from
tropic
forests
to
be
worn
above
as
stern
a
breast
as
stood
king
at
sea
or
anywhere
another
boat
with
other
crew
came
swift
and
silent
in
her
track
and
now
shot
shoreward
now
shot
back
and
now
sat
rocking
fro
and
to
but
never
once
lost
sight
of
her
tall
sunburnt
southern
men
were
these
from
isles
of
blue
caribbean
seas
and
one
that
woman
worshipper
who
looked
on
her
and
loved
but
her
and
one
that
one
was
wild
as
seas
that
wash
the
far
dark
oregon
and
ever
leaning
urging
on
and
standing
up
in
restless
ease
he
seem
as
lithe
and
free
and
tall
and
restless
as
the
boughs
that
stir
perpetual
topt
poplar
trees
and
one
that
one
had
eyes
to
teach
the
art
of
love
and
tongue
to
preach
life
hard
and
sober
homilies
and
yet
his
eager
hands
his
speech
all
spoke
the
bold
adventurer
while
zoned
about
the
belt
of
each
there
swung
a
girt
of
steel
till
all
did
seem
a
walking
arsenal
iv
pursuer
and
pursued
and
who
are
these
that
make
the
sable
crew
these
mighty
titans
black
and
nude
and
bronzed
and
broad
of
chest
as
any
that
dare
this
peopled
solitude
and
who
is
he
that
leads
them
here
and
breaks
the
hush
of
wave
and
wood
comes
he
for
evil
or
for
good
brave
jesuit
or
bold
buccaneer
nay
these
be
idle
themes
let
pass
these
be
but
men
we
may
forget
the
wild
the
tawny
brave
the
frowning
wold
the
woody
shore
the
sunburnt
men
of
mars
but
what
and
who
was
she
the
fair
the
fairest
face
that
ever
yet
look
in
a
wave
as
in
a
glass
that
look
as
look
the
still
far
stars
so
into
the
wave
to
contemplate
their
beauty
there
yet
look
as
looking
anywhere
and
who
of
all
the
world
was
she
a
bride
or
not
a
bride
a
thing
to
love
a
prison
bird
to
sing
you
shall
not
know
that
shall
not
be
brought
from
the
future
great
profound
this
side
the
happy
i
only
saw
her
heard
the
sound
of
murky
waters
gurgling
round
in
from
the
shore
but
heard
the
long
strong
stroke
of
oar
against
the
waters
gray
and
vast
i
only
saw
her
as
she
pass
a
great
sad
beauty
in
whose
eyes
lay
all
the
loves
of
paradise
you
shall
not
know
her
she
who
sat
unconscious
in
my
heart
all
time
i
dreamed
and
wove
this
wayward
rhyme
and
loved
and
did
not
blush
thereat
the
sunlight
of
a
sunlit
land
a
land
of
fruit
of
flowers
and
a
land
of
love
and
calm
delight
a
land
where
night
is
not
like
night
and
noon
is
but
a
name
for
rest
and
love
for
love
is
reckoned
best
where
conversations
of
the
eyes
are
all
enough
where
beauty
thrills
the
heart
like
hues
of
where
rage
lies
down
where
passion
dies
where
peace
hath
her
abiding
place
a
face
that
lifted
up
sweet
face
that
was
so
like
a
life
begun
that
rose
for
me
a
rising
sun
above
the
bended
seven
hills
of
dead
and
risen
old
new
rome
not
that
i
deem
she
loved
me
nay
i
dared
not
even
dream
of
that
i
only
say
i
knew
her
say
she
ever
sat
before
me
sat
all
still
and
voiceless
as
love
is
and
ever
look
so
fair
divine
her
hush
vehement
soul
fill
mine
and
overflowed
with
runic
bliss
and
made
itself
a
part
of
this
o
you
had
loved
her
sitting
there
half
hidden
in
her
loosen
hair
why
you
had
loved
her
for
her
eyes
their
large
and
melancholy
look
of
tenderness
and
well
mistook
their
love
for
light
of
paradise
yea
loved
her
for
her
large
dark
eyes
yea
loved
her
for
her
brow
soft
brown
her
hand
as
light
as
heaven
bars
yea
loved
her
for
her
mouth
her
mouth
was
roses
gather
from
the
south
the
warm
south
side
of
paradise
and
breathed
upon
and
handed
down
by
angels
on
a
stair
of
stars
her
mouth
was
egypt
mouth
of
old
push
out
and
pouting
full
and
bold
with
simple
beauty
where
she
sat
why
you
had
said
on
seeing
her
this
creature
comes
from
out
the
dim
far
centuries
beyond
the
rim
of
time
remotest
reach
or
stir
and
he
who
wrought
semiramis
and
shaped
the
sibyls
seeing
this
had
bow
and
made
a
shrine
thereat
and
all
his
life
had
worshipp
her
devout
as
worshipper
i
dared
not
dream
she
loved
me
nay
her
love
was
proud
and
pride
is
loth
to
look
with
favor
own
it
fond
of
one
the
world
loves
not
no
matter
if
she
loved
or
no
god
knows
i
loved
enough
for
both
and
knew
her
as
you
shall
not
know
till
you
have
known
sweet
death
and
you
have
cross
the
dark
gone
over
to
the
great
majority
beyond
the
black
men
bow
the
long
oars
bent
they
struck
as
if
for
sweet
life
sake
and
one
look
back
but
no
man
spake
and
all
wills
bent
to
one
intent
on
through
the
golden
fringe
of
day
into
the
deep
dark
night
away
and
up
the
wave
walls
of
wood
they
cleft
they
climb
they
bowed
they
bent
but
one
stood
tall
and
restless
stood
and
one
sat
still
all
night
all
day
and
gazed
in
helpless
wonderment
her
hair
pour
down
like
darkling
wine
the
black
men
lean
a
sullen
line
the
bent
oars
kept
a
steady
song
and
all
the
beams
of
bright
sunshine
that
touch
the
waters
wild
and
strong
fell
drifting
down
and
out
of
sight
like
fallen
leaves
and
it
was
night
and
night
and
day
and
many
days
they
climb
the
sudden
dark
gray
tide
and
she
sat
silent
at
his
side
and
he
sat
turning
many
ways
sat
watching
for
his
wily
foe
at
last
he
baffled
him
and
yet
his
brow
gloom
dark
his
lips
were
set
he
lean
he
peer
through
boughs
as
though
from
heart
of
forests
deep
and
dim
grim
shapes
could
come
confronting
him
a
grand
uncommon
man
was
he
and
of
gothic
form
and
hoary
like
a
sea
a
high
sea
broken
up
by
storm
his
face
was
brown
and
overwrought
by
seams
and
shadows
born
of
thought
not
over
gentle
and
his
eyes
bold
restless
resolute
and
deep
too
deep
to
flow
like
shallow
fount
of
common
men
where
waters
mount
and
men
bend
down
their
heads
and
weep
fierce
lumin
eyes
where
flames
might
rise
instead
of
flood
and
flash
and
sweep
strange
eyes
that
look
unsatisfied
with
all
things
fair
or
otherwise
as
if
his
inmost
soul
had
cried
all
time
for
something
yet
unseen
some
thing
denied
a
man
whose
soul
was
mightier
far
than
his
great
self
and
surged
and
fell
about
himself
as
heaving
seas
lift
up
and
lash
and
boom
and
swell
above
some
solitary
bar
that
bursts
through
blown
samoa
sea
and
wreck
and
toss
eternally
vi
below
the
overhanging
boughs
the
oars
laid
idle
at
the
last
yet
long
he
look
for
hostile
prows
from
out
the
wood
and
down
the
stream
they
came
not
and
he
came
to
dream
pursuit
abandon
danger
past
he
fell
the
oak
he
built
a
home
of
wood
with
busy
hand
and
said
my
wanderings
are
told
and
said
no
more
by
sea
by
land
shall
i
break
rest
or
drift
or
roam
for
i
am
worn
and
i
grow
old
and
there
beside
that
surging
tide
where
gray
waves
meet
and
wheel
and
strike
the
man
sat
down
as
satisfied
to
sit
and
rest
unto
the
end
as
if
the
strong
man
here
had
found
a
sort
of
brother
in
this
sea
this
surging
sounding
majesty
of
troubled
water
so
profound
so
sullen
strong
and
so
sinuous
and
foamy
bound
hast
seen
missouri
cleave
the
wood
in
sounding
whirlpools
to
the
sea
what
soul
hath
known
such
majesty
what
man
stood
by
and
understood
by
pleasant
omaha
i
stood
beneath
a
fringe
of
mailéd
wood
and
watch
the
mighty
waters
heave
and
surge
and
strike
and

and
weave
and
make
strange
sounds

all

then
long
the
long

idle
lay
the
cabin
smoke
came
forth
and
right
lazily
from

brake
and

went
by
the
other

and
who
was
she
the
strong
man
pride
this
one
fair
woman
of
the
world
a
captive
bride
or
not
a
bride
her
eyes
men
say
grew
sad
and
dim
with
watching
from
the
river
rim
as
waiting
for
some
face
denied
and
yet
she
never
wept
or
spake
or
breath
his
name
for
her
love
sake
yea
who
was
she
none
ever
knew
the
great
strong
river
swept
around
the
cabins
nestled
in
its
bend
but
kept
its
secrets
wild
birds
flew
in

by
the
black
men
found
diversion
in
the
chase
and
wide
old
morgan
ranged
the

nor
friend
nor
foeman
ever
at
his
side
or
shared
his
forests
deep
and
dim
or
cross
his
path
or
question
him
he
stood
as
one
who
found
and
named
the
middle
world
what
visions
flamed
athwart
the
west
what
prophecies
were
his
the
gray
old
man
that
day
who
stood
alone
and
look
away
awest
from
out
the
waving
trees
against
the
utter
sundown
seas
alone
beside
the
stream
he
stood
and
gazed
as
in
a
dream
as
if
he
knew
a
life
unknown
to
those
who
knew
him
thus
alone
his
eyes
were
gray
and
overborne
by
shaggy
brows
his
strength
was
shorn
yet
still
he
ever
gazed
awest
as
one
who
would
not
could
not
rest
and
whence
came
he
and
when
and
why
men
question
men
but
nought
was
known
save
that
he
roam
the
woods
alone
and
lived
alone
beneath
the
stir
of
leaves
and
letting
life
go
by
did
look
on
her
and
only
her
and
had
he
fled
with
bloody
hand
or
had
he
loved
some
helen
fair
and
battling
lost
both
land
and
town
say
did
he
see
his
walls
go
down
then
choose
from
all
his
treasures
there
this
love
and
seek
some
other
land
and
yet
the
current
of
his
life
mostlike
had
flow
like
oil
had
been
a
monk
for
aught
that
all
men
knew
mostlike
the
sad
man
only
sin
a
cruel
one
for
thought
is
strife
had
been
the
curse
of
thought
all
through
mayhap
his
splendid
soul
had
insipid
sweet
society
that
stinks
in
nostrils
of
all
men
and
and
free
that
tasting
to
satiety
her
hollow
sweets
he
proudly
turn
and
did
rebel
and
curse
her
then
and
then
did
stoop
and
from
the
sod
pluck
this
one
flower
for
his
breast
then
turn
to
solitude
for
rest
and
turn
from

the

stood

out

made
overhead

so
the
seasons
kept
their
round
yet
still
old
morgan
went
and
came
from
cabin
door
to
forest
dim
through
wold
of
snows
through
wood
of
flame
through
golden
days
hung
round
in
soft
september
haze
and
no
man
cross
or
question
him
nay
there
was
that
in
his
stern
air
that
held
these
rude
men
aloof
none
came
to
share
the
roof
that
rose
so
beside
the
angry
rushing
sullen
tide
and
only
black
men
gather
there
the
old
man
slaves
in
dull
content
black
silent
and
obedient
then
men
push
westward
through
his
wood
his
wild
beasts
fled
and
now
he
stood
confronting
men
he
had
no
man
but
still
he
went
and
came
apart
and
shook
his
beard
and
strode
his
ways
alone
and
bore
his
load
if
load
it
were
apart
alone
then
men
grew
busy
with
a
name
that
no
man
loved
that
many
fear
and
cowards
stoop
and
cast
a
stone
as
at
some
statue
overthrown
some
said
a
pirate
blown
by
night
from
isles
of
calm
caribbean
land
who
left
his
comrades
that
he
fled
with
many
prices
on
his
head
and
that
he
bore
in
his
hot
flight
the
gather
treasure
of
his
band
in
bloody
and
unholy
hand
then
some
did
say
a
privateer
then
others
that
he
fled
from
fear
and
climb
the
mad
missouri
far
to
where
the
friendly
forests
are
and
that
his
gold
lay
sunken
in
his
black
boat
hold
then
others
watching
his
fair
bride
said
there
is
something
more
beside
some
said
a
stolen
bride
was
she
and
that
his
strong
arm
in
the
strife
was
red
with
her
own
brother
life
and
that
her
lover
from
the
sea
lay
waiting
for
his
chosen
wife
and
that
a
day
of
reckoning
lay
waiting
for
this
grizzled
king
o
sweet
that
ever
gazed
from
out
the
wood
and
down
the
wave
o
eyes
that
never
once
were
raised
o
mouth
that
never
murmur
gave
ix
o
ina
all
the
years
brought
her
but
solitude
and
tears
lo
ever
looking
out
she
stood
adown
the
wave
adown
the
wood
adown
the
strong
stream
to
the
south
and
sorrowful
her
mouth
push
out
so
pitiful
her
eyes
fill
full
of
sorrow
and
surprise
men
say
that
looking
from
her
place
a
love
would
sometimes
light
her
face
as
if
sweet
recollections
her
heart
and
broke
its
loneliness
like
far
sweet
songs
that
come
to
us
so
soft
so
sweet
they
are
not
heard
so
far
so
faint
they
fill
the
air
a
fragrance
filling
anywhere
and
wasting
all
her
summer
years
that
utter
only
through
her
tears
the
seasons
went
and
still
she
stood
for
ever
watching
down
the
wood
yet
in
her
heart
there
held
a
strife
with
all
this
wasting
of
sweet
life
that
none
who
have
not
lived
and
died
held
up
the
two
hands
crucified
between
the
ways
on
either
hand
can
look
upon
or
understand
the
blackest
muffle
fire
between
a
duty
and
desire
there
lies
no
middle
way
or
land
take
thou
the
right
or
the
left
hand
and
so
pursue
nor
hesitate
to
boldly
give
your
hand
to
fate
in
helpless
indecisions
lie
the
rocks
on
which
we
strike
and
die
better
far
to
choose
the
worst
of
all
life
ways
than
to
be
cursed
with
indecision
turn
and
choose
your
way
then
all
the
world
refuse
and
men
who
saw
her
still
do
say
that
never
once
her
lips
were
heard
by
gloaming
dusk
or
shining
day
to
utter
or
pronounce
one
word
men
went
and
came
and
still
she
stood
in
silence
watching
down
the
wood
yea
still
she
stood
and
look
away
by
tawny
night
by
day
adown
the
wood
beyond
the
land
her
hollow
face
upon
her
hand
her
black
abundant
hair
all
down
about
her
loose
ungather
gown
and
what
her
thought
her
life
unsaid
was
it
of
love
of
hate
of
him
the
tall
dark
southerner
her
head
bow
down
the
day
fell
dim
upon
her
eyes
she
bow
she
slept
she
waken
then
and
waking
wept
she
dream
perchance
of
island
home
a
land
of
palms
ring
round
with
foam
where
summer
on
her
shelly
shore
sits
down
and
rests
for
evermore
and
one
who
watch
her
wasted
youth
did
guess
mayhap
with
much
of
truth
her
heart
was
with
that
band
that
came
against
her
isle
with
sword
and
flame
and
this
the
tale
he
told
of
her
and
her
fierce
silent
follower
a
spaniard
and
adventurer
a
man
who
saw
her
loved
and
fell
upon
his
knees
and
worshipp
her
and
with
that
fervor
and
mad
zeal
that
only
sunborn
bosoms
feel
did
vow
to
love
to
follow
her
unto
the
altar
or
to
hell
that
then
her
father
bore
the
beauteous
maiden
hurriedly
from
out
her
fair
isle
of
the
sea
to
sombre
wold
and
woody
shore
and
far
away
and
kept
her
well
as
from
a
habitant
of
hell
and
vow
she
should
not
meet
him
more
that
fearing
still
the
buccaneer
he
silent
kept
his
forests
here
the
while
men
came
and
still
she
stood
for
ever
watching
from
the
wood
x
the
bushy
squirrels
ran
like
shadows
shatter
through
the
boughs
the
gallant
robin
chirp
his
vows
the
pheasant
thrumm
his
fan
a
thousand
blackbirds
were
in
and
it
was
spring
old
morgan
left
his
cabin
door
and
one
sat
watching
as
of
yore
but
why
turned
morgan
face
as
white
as
his
white
beard
a
bird
aflight
a
squirrel
peering
through
the
trees
saw
some
one
silent
steal
away
like
darkness
from
the
face
of
day
saw
two
black
eyes
look
back
and
these
saw
her
hand
beckon
through
the
trees
he
knew
him
though
he
had
not
seen
that
form
or
face
for
a
decade
though
time
had
shorn
his
locks
had
made
his
form
another
flow
between
their
lives
like
some
uncompass
sea
yet
still
he
knew
him
as
before
he
pursed
his
lips
and
silently
he
turn
and
sought
his
cabin
door
ay
they
have
come
the
men
to
beard
old
morgan
in
his
den
it
matters
little
who
they
are
these
silent
men
from
isles
afar
and
truly
no
one
cares
or
knows
what
be
their
merit
or
demand
it
is
enough
for
this
rude
land
at
least
it
is
enough
for
those
the
loud
of
tongue
and
rude
of
hand
to
know
that
they
are
morgan
foes
proud
morgan
more
than
tongue
can
tell
he
loved
that
woman
watching
there
that
stood
in
her
dark
stream
of
hair
that
stood
and
dream
as
in
a
spell
and
look
so
fix
and
far
away
and
who
that
loveth
woman
well
is
wholly
bad
be
who
he
may
ay
we
have
seen
these
southern
men
these
men
from
island
shore
in
this
same
land
and
long
before
they
do
not
seem
so
lithe
as
then
they
do
not
look
so
tall
and
they
seem
not
so
many
as
of
old
but
that
same
resolute
and
bold
expression
of
unbridled
will
that
even
time
must
half
obey
is
with
them
and
is
of
them
still
they
do
not
counsel
the
decree
of
court
or
council
where
they
drew
their
breath
nor
law
nor
order
knew
save
but
the
strong
hand
of
the
strong
where
each
stood
up
avenged
his
wrong
or
sought
his
death
all
silently
they
watch
along
the
wave
and
wood
they
heed
but
haste
not
their
estate
it
be
can
bide
and
wait
be
it
open
ill
or
hidden
good
no
law
for
them
for
they
have
stood
with
steel
and
writ
their
rights
in
blood
and
now
whatever
is
they
seek
whatever
be
their
dark
demand
why
they

stopp
short
breathed
sharp
threw
wide
the
door
then
gazed
beyond
the
murky
tide
toward
where
the
forky
peaks
divide
he
took
his
beard
in
his
hard
hand
then
slowly
shook
his
grizzled
head
and
trembled
but
no
word
he
said
his
thought
was
something
more
than
pain
upon
the
seas
upon
the
land
he
knew
he
should
not
rest
again
he
turn
to
her
but
then
once
more
quick
turn
and
through
the
oaken
door
he
sudden
pointed
to
the
west
his
eye
resumed
its
old
command
the
conversation
of
his
hand
it
was
enough
she
knew
the
rest
he
turn
he
stoop
and
smoothed
her
hair
as
if
to
smooth
away
the
care
from
his
great
heart
with
his
left
hand
his
right
hand
hitch
the
pistol
round
that
dangled
at
his
belt
the
sound
of
steel
to
him
was
melody
more
sweet
than
any
song
of
sea
he
touch
his
pistol
press
his
lips
then
tapp
it
with
his
and
toy
with
it
as
harper
hand
seeks
out
the
chords
when
he
is
sad
and
purposeless
at
last
he
had
resolved
in
haste
he
touch
her
hair
made
sign
she
should
arise
prepare
for
some
long
journey
then
again
he
look
awest
toward
the
plain
toward
the
land
of
dreams
and
space
the
land
of
silences
the
land
of
shoreless
deserts
sown
with
sand
where
desolation
dwelling
is
the
land
where
wondering
you
say
what
shoreless
sea
is
this
where
wandering
from
day
to
day
you
say
sure
we
come
to
rest
in
some
cool
and
yet
you
journey
on
through
space
while
seasons
pass
and
are
struck
dumb
with
marvel
at
the
distances
yea
he
would
go
go
utterly
away
and
from
all
living
kind
pierce
through
the
distances
and
find
new
lands
he
had
outlived
his
race
he
stood
like
some
eternal
tree
that
tops
remote
yosemite
and
can
not
fall
he
turn
his
face
again
and
contemplated
space
and
then
he
raised
his
hand
to
vex
his
beard
stood
still
and
there
fell
down
great
drops
from
some
unfrequent
spring
and
streak
his
channell
cheeks
and
ran
uncheck
as
one
who
recks
nor
joy
nor
tears
nor
any
thing
and
then
his
broad
breast
heaving
deep
like
some
dark
sea
in
troubled
sleep
blown
round
with
groaning
ships
and
wrecks
he
sudden
roused
himself
and
stood
with
all
the
strength
of
his
stern
mood
then
call
his
men
and
bade
them
go
and
bring
black
steeds
with
banner
necks
and
strong
like
burly
buffalo
xii
the
sassafras
took
leaf
and
men
push
west
in
hosts
the
black
men
drew
their
horses
silent
through
the
solemn
woods
one
midnight
when
the
curl
moon
tipp
her
horn
and
threw
a
black
oak
shadow
slant
across
a
low
mound
hid
in
leaves
and
moss
old
morgan
cautious
came
and
drew
from
out
the
ground
as
from
a
grave
a
great
box
and
old
and
fill
men
say
with
pirates
gold
and
then
they
silent
as
a
dream
in
long
black
shadows
cross
the
stream
lo
here
the
smoke
of
cabins
curl
the
borders
of
the
middle
world
and
mighty
hairy
men
sat
down
in
silence
held
at
bay
by
mailèd
forests
far
away
the
red
men
boundless
borders
lay
and
lodges
stood
in
legions
then
strip
pyramids
of
painted
men
what
strong
uncommon
men
were
these
these
settlers
hewing
to
the
seas
great
men
and
tan
men
blown
from
any
border
land
men
desperate
and
red
of
hand
and
men
in
love
and
men
in
debt
and
men
who
lived
but
to
forget
and
men
whose
very
hearts
had
died
who
only
sought
these
woods
to
hide
their
wretchedness
held
in
the
van
yet
every
man
among
them
stood
alone
along
that
sounding
wood
and
every
man
somehow
a
man
a
race
of
unnamed
giants
these
that
moved
like
gods
among
the
trees
so
stern
so
and
slow
with
strength
of
buffalo
and
each
man
notable
and
tall
a
kingly
and
unconscious
saul
a
sort
of
sullen
hercules
a
star
stood
large
and
white
awest
then
time
uprose
and
testified
they
push
the
mailèd
wood
aside
they
toss
the
forest
like
a
toy
that
great
forgotten
race
of
men
the
boldest
band
that
yet
has
been
together
since
the
siege
of
troy
and
followed
it
and
found
their
rest
what
strength
what
strife
what
rude
unrest
what
shocks
what
armies
met
a
mighty
nation
moving
west
with
all
its
steely
sinews
set
against
the
living
forests
hear
the
shouts
the
shots
of
pioneer
the
rended
forests
rolling
wheels
as
if
some
army
reels
recoils
redoubles
comes
again
loud
sounding
like
a
hurricane
o
bearded
stalwart
westmost
men
so
so
a
kingdom
won
without
the
guilt
of
studied
battle
that
hath
been
your
blood
inheritance
your
heirs
know
not
your
tombs
the
great
ploughshares
cleave
softly
through
the
mellow
loam
where
you
have
made
eternal
home
and
set
no
sign
your
epitaphs
are
writ
in
furrows
beauty
laughs
while
through
the
green
ways
wandering
beside
her
love
slow
gathering
white
blooms
above
your
lowly
levell
tombs
and
then
below
the
spotted
sky
she
stops
she
leans
she
wonders
why
the
ground
is
heaved
and
broken
so
and
why
the
grasses
darker
grow
and
droop
and
trail
like
wounded
wing
yea
time
the
grand
old
harvester
has
gather
you
from
wood
and
plain
we
call
to
you
again
again
the
rush
and
rumble
of
the
car
comes
back
in
answer
deep
and
wide
the
wheels
of
progress
have
pass
on
the
silent
pioneer
is
gone
his
ghost
is
moving
down
the
trees
and
now
we
push
the
memories
of
bluff
bold
men
who
dared
and
died
in
foremost
battle
quite
aside
o
perfect
eden
of
the
earth
in
poppies
sown
in
harvest
set
o
sires
mothers
of
my
west
how
shall
we
count
your
proud
bequest
but
yesterday
ye
gave
us
birth
we
eat
your
bread
nor
toil
nor
spin
nor
make
regret
but
praise
our
petty
selves
and
say
how
great
we
are
and
all
forget
the
still
endurance
of
the
rude
unpolish
sons
of
solitude
xiii
and
one
was
glad
at
morn
but
one
the
tall
old
grim
and
gray
look
back
to
where
his
cabins
lay
and
seem
to
hesitate
he
rose
at
last
as
from
his
dream
repose
from
rest
that
counterfeited
rest
and
set
his
blown
beard
to
the
west
and
drove
against
the
setting
sun
along
the
levels
vast
and
dun
his
steeds
were
steady
strong
and
fleet
the
best
in
all
the
wide
west
land
their
manes
were
in
the
air
their
feet
seem
scarce
to
touch
the
flying
sand
the
reins
were
in
the
reaching
hand
they
rode
like
men
gone
mad
they
fled
all
day
and
many
days
they
ran
and
in
the
rear
a
gray
old
man
kept
watch
and
ever
turn
his
head
half
eager
and
half
angry
back
along
their
dusty
desert
track
and
one
look
back
but
no
man
spoke
they
rode
they
swallow
up
the
plain
the
sun
sank
low
he
look
again
with
lifted
hand
and
shaded
eyes
then
far
arear
he
saw
uprise
as
if
from
giant
stride
or
stroke
dun
puffs
of
he
turn
his
left
hand
clutch
the
rein
he
struck
awest
his
high
right
hand
his
arms
were
like
the
limbs
of
oak
they
knew
too
well
the
man
command
they
mounted
plunged
ahead
again
and
one
look
back
but
no
man
spoke
of
all
that
sullen
iron
band
that
reached
along
that
barren
land
o
weary
days
of
weary
blue
without
one
changing
breath
without
one
single
sailing
through
the
blue
seas
bending
round
about
in
one
unbroken
blotless
hue
yet
on
they
fled
and
one
look
back
for
ever
down
their
distant
track
the
tent
is
pitch
the
blanket
spread
the
earth
receives
the
weary
head
the
night
rolls
west
the
east
is
gray
the
tent
is
struck
they
mount
away
they
ride
for
life
the
livelong
day
they
sweep
the
long
grass
in
their
track
and
one
leads
on
and
one
looks
back
what
scenes
they
pass
what
camps
at
morn
what
weary
columns
kept
the
road
what
herds
of
troubled
cattle
low
and
trumpeted
like
lifted
horn
and
everywhere
or
road
or
rest
all
things
were
pointing
to
the
west
a
weary
long
and
lonesome
track
and
all
led
on
but
one
look
back
they
climb
the
breasts
of
earth
the
blowy
steeps
that
cradled
time
where
freedom
keeps
her
flag
of
white
blown
stars
unfurl
they
turn
about
they
saw
the
birth
of
sudden
dawn
upon
the
world
again
they
gazed
they
saw
the
face
of
god
and
named
it
boundless
space
and
they
descended
and
did
roam
through
levell
distances
set
round
by
room
they
saw
the
silences
move
by
and
beckon
saw
the
forms
the
very
beards
of
burly
storms
and
heard
them
talk
like
sounding
seas
on
unnamed
heights
and
brown
and
torn
like
battlements
of
mars
they
saw
the
darknesses
come
down
like
curtains
loosen
from
the
dome
of
god
cathedral
built
of
stars
they
pitch
the
tent
where
rivers
run
as
if
to
drown
the
falling
sun
they
saw
the
snowy
mountains
roll
and
heaved
along
the
nameless
lands
like
mighty
billows
saw
the
gold
of
awful
sunsets
saw
the
blush
of
sudden
dawn
and
felt
the
hush
of
heaven
when
the
day
sat
down
and
hid
his
face
in
dusky
hands
the
long
and
lonesome
nights
the
tent
that
nestled
soft
in
sweep
of
grass
the
hills
against
the
firmament
where
scarce
the
moving
moon
could
pass
the
cautious
camp
the
smother
light
the
silent
sentinel
at
night
the
wild
beasts
howling
from
the
hill
the
troubled
cattle
bellowing
the
savage
prowling
by
the
spring
then
sudden
passing
swift
and
still
and
bended
as
a
bow
is
bent
the
arrow
sent
the
arrow
spent
and
buried
in
its
bloody
place
the
dead
man
lying
on
his
face
the
clouds
of
dust
their
cloud
by
day
their
pillar
of
unfailing
fire
the
far
north
star
and
high
and
higher
they
climb
so
high
it
seem
eftsoon
that
they
must
face
the
falling
moon
that
like
some
ruin
lay
thrown
down
before
their
weary
way
they
learn
to
read
the
sign
of
storms
the
moon
wide
circles
sunset
bars
and
blood
and
flame
and
like
the
chaldean
shepherds
came
at
night
to
name
the
moving
stars
in
heaven
face
they
pictured
forms
of
beasts
of
fishes
of
the
sea
they
mark
the
great
bear
wearily
rise
up
and
drag
his
clinking
chain
of
stars
around
the
starry
main
what
lines
of
yoked
and
patient
steers
what
weary
thousands
pushing
west
what
restless
pilgrims
seeking
rest
as
if
from
out
the
edge
of
years
what
great
yoked
brutes
with
briskets
low
with
wrinkled
necks
like
buffalo
with
round
brown
liquid
pleading
eyes
that
turn
so
slow
and
sad
to
you
that
shone
like
love
eyes
soft
with
tears
that
seem
to
plead
and
make
replies
the
while
they
bow
their
necks
and
drew
the
creaking
load
and
look
at
you
their
sable
briskets
swept
the
ground
their
cloven
feet
kept
solemn
sound
two
sullen
bullocks
led
the
line
their
great
eyes
shining
bright
like
wine
two
sullen
captive
kings
were
they
that
had
in
time
held
herds
at
bay
and
even
now
they
crush
the
sod
with
stolid
sense
of
majesty
and
stately
stepp
and
stately
trod
as
if
was
something
still
to
be
kings
even
in
captivity
xiv
and
why
did
these
same
sunburnt
men
let
morgan
gain
the
plain
and
then
pursue
him
to
the
utter
sea
you
ask
me
here
impatiently
and
i
as
pertly
must
reply
my
task
is
but
to
tell
a
tale
to
give
a
wide
sail
to
the
gale
to
paint
the
boundless
plain
the
sky
to
rhyme
nor
give
a
reason
why
mostlike
they
sought
his
gold
alone
and
fear
to
make
their
quarrel
known
lest
it
should
keep
its
secret
bed
mostlike
they
thought
to
best
prevail
and
conquer
with
united
hands
alone
upon
the
lonesome
sands
mostlike
they
had
as
much
to
dread
mostlike
but
i
must
tell
my
tale
and
morgan
ever
looking
back
push
on
push
up
his
mountain
track
past
camp
past
train
past
caravan
past
flying
beast
past
failing
man
past
brave
men
battling
with
a
foe
that
circled
them
with
lance
and
bow
and
feather
arrows
all
till
months
unmeasured
came
and
ran
the
calendar
with
him
as
though
old
time
had
lost
all
reckoning
then
passed
for
aye
the
creaking
trains
and
pioneers
that
named
the
plains
those
brave
old
bricks
of
what
lives
they
lived
what
deaths
they
died
a
thousand
cañons
darkling
wide
below
sierra
slopes
of
pine
receive
them
now
and
they
who
died
along
the
far
dim
desert
route
their
ghosts
are
many
let
them
keep
their
vast
possessions
the
piute
the
tawny
warrior
will
dispute
no
boundary
with
these
and
i
who
saw
them
live
who
felt
them
die
say
let
their
unploughed
ashes
sleep
untouched
by
man
by
plain
or
steep
the
bearded
sunbrown
men
who
bore
the
burthen
of
that
frightful
year
who
toil
but
did
not
gather
store
they
shall
not
be
forgotten
drear
and
white
the
plains
of
shoshonee
shall
point
us
to
that
farther
shore
and
long
white
shining
lines
of
bones
make
needless
sign
or
white
the
wild
man
yell
the
groaning
wheel
the
train
that
moved
like
drifting
barge
the
dust
that
rose
up
like
a
cloud
like
smoke
of
distant
battle
loud
the
great
whips
rang
like
shot
and
steel
of
antique
fashion
crude
and
large
flash
back
as
in
some
battle
charge
they
sought
yea
they
did
find
their
rest
along
that
long
and
lonesome
way
these
brave
men
buffeting
the
west
with
lifted
faces
full
were
they
of
great
endeavor
brave
and
true
as
stern
crusader
clad
in
steel
they
died
as
it
was
fit
made
strong
with
hope
they
dared
to
do
achievement
that
a
host
would
stagger
at
stand
back
and
reel
defeated
at
the
thought
of
it
what
brave
endeavor
to
endure
what
patient
hope
when
hope
was
past
what
still
surrender
at
the
last
a
thousand
leagues
from
hope
how
pure
they
lived
how
proud
they
died
how
generous
with
life
the
wide
and
gloried
age
of
chivalry
hath
not
one
page
like
this
to
me
let
all
these
golden
days
go
by
in
sunny
summer
weather
i
but
think
upon
my
buried
brave
and
breathe
beneath
another
sky
let
beauty
glide
in
gilded
car
and
find
my
sundown
seas
afar
forgetful
that
is
but
one
grave
from
eastmost
to
the
westmost
wave
yea
i
remember
the
still
tears
that
uncoffin
faces
fell
the
final
silent
sad
farewell
god
these
are
with
me
all
the
years
they
shall
be
with
me
ever
i
shall
not
forget
i
hold
a
trust
they
are
a
part
of
my
existence
when
adown
the
shining
iron
track
you
sweep
and
fields
of
corn
flash
back
and
herds
of
lowing
steers
move
by
and
men
laugh
loud
in
mute
distrust
i
turn
to
other
days
to
men
who
made
a
pathway
with
their
dust
xv
at
last
he
pass
all
men
or
sign
of
man
yet
still
his
long
black
line
was
push
and
pointed
for
the
west
the
sea
the
utmost
sea
and
rest
he
climbed
descended
climbed
again
until
he
stood
at
last
as
lone
as
solitary
and
unknown
as
some
lost
ship
upon
the
main
o
there
was
grandeur
in
his
air
an
splendor
in
his
eye
when
he
had
climb
the
bleak
the
high
the
bastions
of
the
plain
and
thrown
his
blown
white
hair
and
halting
turn
to
look
again
and
long
from
out
his
lofty
place
he
look
far
down
the
fading
plain
for
his
pursuers
but
in
vain
yea
he
was
glad
across
his
face
a
careless
smile
was
seen
to
play
the
first
for
many
a
stormy
day
he
turn
to
ina
dark
and
fair
as
some
sad
twilight
touch
her
hair
stoop
low
and
kiss
her
silently
then
silent
held
her
to
his
breast
then
waved
command
to
his
black
men
look
east
then
mounted
slow
and
then
led
leisurely
against
the
west
and
why
should
he
who
dared
to
die
who
more
than
once
with
hissing
breath
had
set
his
teeth
and
pray
for
death
have
fled
these
men
or
wherefore
fly
before
them
now
why
not
defy
his
midnight
men
were
strong
and
true
and
not
unused
to
strife
and
knew
the
masonry
of
steel
right
well
and
all
its
signs
that
lead
to
hell
it
might
have
been
his
youth
had
wrought
some
wrong
his
years
would
now
repair
that
made
him
fly
and
still
forbear
it
might
have
been
he
only
sought
to
lead
them
to
some
fatal
snare
and
let
them
die
by
there
it
might
have
been
that
his
own
blood
a
brother
son
pursued
with
curse
it
might
have
been
this
woman
fair
was
this
man
child
an
only
thing
to
love
in
all
the
universe
and
that
the
old
man
iron
will
kept
pirate
child
from
pirate
still
these
rovers
had
a
world
their
own
had
laws
lived
lives
went
ways
unknown
i
trow
it
was
not
shame
or
fear
of
any
man
or
any
thing
that
death
in
any
shape
might
bring
it
might
have
been
some
lofty
sense
of
his
own
truth
and
innocence
and
virtues
lofty
and
severe
nay
nay
what
need
of
reasons
here
they
touch
a
fringe
of
tossing
trees
that
bound
a
mountain
brow
like
bay
and
through
the
fragrant
boughs
a
breeze
blew
freshness
far
away
from
mountain
brow
to
desert
base
lay
chaos
space
unbounded
space
in
one
vast
belt
of
purple
bound
the
black
men
cried
the
sea
they
their
black
heads
in
their
hard
black
hands
they
wept
for
joy
they
laugh
and
broke
the
silence
of
an
age
and
spoke
of
rest
at
last
and
group
in
bands
they
threw
their
long
black
arms
about
each
other
necks
and
laugh
aloud
then
wept
again
with
laugh
and
shout
yet
morgan
spake
no
word
but
led
his
band
with
head
right
through
the
cooling
trees
till
he
stood
out
upon
the
lofty
brow
and
mighty
mountain
wall
and
now
the
men
who
shouted
lo
the
sea
rode
in
the
sun
but
silently
stood
in
the
sun
then
look
below
they
look
but
once
then
look
away
then
look
each
other
in
the
face
they
could
not
lift
their
brows
nor
say
but
held
their
heads
nor
spake
for
lo
nor
sea
nor
voice
of
sea
nor
breath
of
sea
but
only
sand
and
death
and
one
eternity
of
space
confronted
them
with
fiery
face
was
vastness
even
as
a
sea
so
still
it
sang
in
symphonies
but
yet
without
the
sense
of
seas
save
depth
and
space
and
distances
was
all
so
shoreless
so
profound
it
seem
it
were
earth
utter
bound
was
like
the
dim
edge
of
death
is
was
hades
hell
eternity
xvi
then
morgan
hesitating
stood
look
down
the
deep
and
steep
descent
with
wilder
brow
and
wonderment
then
gazed
against
the
cooling
wood
and
she
beside
him
gazed
at
this
then
turn
her
great
sad
eyes
to
his
he
shook
his
head
and
look
away
then
sadly
smiled
and
still
did
say
child

xvii
old
morgan
eyed
his
men
look
back
against
the
groves
of
tamarack
then
tapp
his
and
his
hard
left
hand
along
the
mane
of
his
strong
steed
and
careless
his
fingers
through
the
silken
skein
and
seemed
a
time
to
touch
the
rein
and
then
he
spurr
him
to
her
side
and
reach
his
hand
and
leaning
wide
he
smiling
push
her
falling
hair
back
from
her
brow
and
kiss
her
there
yea
touch
her
softly
as
if
she
had
been
some
priceless
tender
flower
yet
touch
her
as
one
taking
leave
of
his
one
love
in
lofty
tower
before
descending
to
the
sea
of
battle
on
his
battle
eve
xviii
a
distant
shout
quick
oaths
alarms
the
black
men
start
up
suddenly
stand
in
the
stirrup
clutch
their
arms
and
bare
bright
arms
all
instantly
but
he
he
slowly
turns
and
he
looks
all
his
full
soul
in
her
face
he
does
not
shout
he
does
not
say
but
sits
serenely
in
his
place
a
time
then
slowly
turns
looks
back
between
the
tamarack
and
up
the
winding
mountain
way
to
where
the
long
strong
grasses
lay
he
raised
his
glass
in
his
two
hands
then
in
his
left
hand
let
it
fall
then
seem
to
count
his
fingers
then
reach
his
glass
waved
cold
commands
then
tapp
his
stirrup
as
before
stood
in
the
stirrup
stern
and
tall
then
ran
his
hand
along
the
mane
half
and
that
was
all
his
head
half
settled
on
his
breast
his
face
like
bird
and
then
he
roused
himself
he
spoke
he
reach
an
arm
like
arm
of
oak
he
struck
his
great
broad
hand
and
seem
to
hurl
his
hot
command
he
clutch
his
rein
struck
sharp
his
heel
look
at
his
men
and
smiled
half
sad
half
desperate
then
hitch
his
steel
and
all
his
stormy
presence
had
as
if
he
kept
once
more
his
keel
on
listless
seas
where
breakers
reel
he
toss
again
his
iron
hand
above
the
deep
steep
desert
space
above
the
burning
seas
of
sand
and
look
his
black
men
in
the
face
they
spake
not
nor
look
back
again
they
struck
the
heel
they
clutch
the
rein
and
down
the
darkling
plunging
steep
they
dropped
toward
the
deep
below
it
seem
a
league
below
the
black
men
rode
and
she
rode
well
against
the
gleaming
sheening
haze
that
shone
like
some
vast
sea
ablaze
that
seem
to
gleam
to
glint
to
glow
as
if
it
mark
the
shores
of
hell
then
morgan
stood
alone
look
back
from
off
the
fierce
wall
where
he
stood
and
watch
his
dusk
approaching
foe
he
saw
him
creep
along
his
track
saw
him
descending
from
the
wood
and
smiled
to
see
how
worn
and
slow
then
when
his
foemen
hounding
came
in
of
where
he
stood
he
wound
his
hand
in
his
steed
mane
and
plunging
to
the
desert
plain
threw
back
his
white
beard
like
a
cloud
and
looking
back
did
shout
aloud
defiance
like
a
stormy
flood
and
shouted
vasques
called
his
name
and
dared
him
to
the
desert
flame
xix
a
cloud
of
dust
adown
the
steep
where
scarce
a
whirling
hawk
would
sweep
the
cloud
his
foes
had
follow
fast
and
morgan
like
a
cloud
had
pass
yet
passed
like
some
proud
king
of
old
and
now
mad
vasques
could
not
hold
control
of
his
one
wild
desire
to
meet
old
morgan
in
his
ire
he
cursed
aloud
he
shook
his
rein
above
the
desert
darkling
deep
and
urged
his
steed
toward
the
steep
but
urged
his
weary
steed
in
vain
old
morgan
heard
his
oath
and
shout
and
morgan
turn
his
head
once
more
and
wheel
his
stout
steed
short
about
then
seem
to
count
their
numbers
and
then
his
right
hand
touch
his
steel
and
then
he
tapp
his
iron
heel
and
seem
to
fight
with
thought
at
last
as
if
the
final
die
was
cast
and
cast
as
carelessly
as
one
would
toss
a
white
coin
in
the
sun
he
touch
his
rein
once
more
and
then
his
pistol
laid
with
idle
heed
prone
down
the
toss
mane
of
his
steed
and
he
rode
down
the
rugged
way
where
the
wide
white
desert
lay
by
broken
gorge
and
cavern
den
and
join
his
band
of
midnight
men
some
say
the
gray
old
man
had
crazed
from
mountain
fruits
that
he
had
while
winding
through
the
wooded
ways
above
the
steep
but
others
say
that
he
had
turn
aside
and
sweet
poison
from
the
honey
dews
that
lie
like
manna
all
the
day
on
dewy
leaves
so
crystal
fair
and
temptingly
that
none
refuse
that
thus
made
mad
the
man
did
dare
confront
the
desert
and
despair
then
other
mountain
men
explain
that
when
one
looks
upon
this
sea
of
glowing
sand
he
looks
again
again
through
gossamers
that
run
in
scintillations
of
the
sun
along
this
white
eternity
and
looks
until
the
brain
is
dazed
bewilder
and
the
man
is
crazed
then
one
a
grizzled
mountaineer
a
thin
and
sinewy
old
man
with
face
all
and
tan
and
presence
silent
and
austere
does
tell
a
tale
with
reaching
face
and
bated
breath
of
this
weird
place
of
many
a
stalwart
mountaineer
and
piute
tall
who
perish
here
he
tells
a
tale
with
whisper
breath
of
men
who
track
this
shore
once
populous
with
town
and
saw
a
woman
wondrous
fair
and
wooing
follow
her
far
down
through
burning
sands
to
certain
death
and
then
he
catches
short
his
breath
he
tells
nay
this
is
all
too
long
enough
the
old
man
shakes
his
hair
when
he
is
done
and
shuts
his
eyes
so
satisfied
and
so
as
if
to
say
is
nothing
rare
this
following
the
luring
fair
to
death
and
bound
in
thorny
thong
was
ever
thus
the
old
old
song
xx
go
ye
and
look
upon
that
land
that
far
vast
land
that
few
behold
and
none
beholding
understand
that
old
old
land
which
men
call
new
that
land
as
old
as
time
is
old
go
journey
with
the
seasons
through
its
wastes
and
learn
how
limitless
how
shoreless
lie
the
distances
before
you
come
to
question
this
or
dare
to
dream
what
grandeur
is
the
solemn
silence
of
that
plain
where
unmanned
tempests
ride
and
reign
it
awes
and
it
possesses
you
is
oh
so
eloquent
the
blue
and
bended
skies
seem
built
for
it
with
rounded
roof
all
fashioned
fit
and
frescoed
clouds
and
true
while
all
else
seems
so
far
so
vain
an
idle
tale
but
illy
told
before
this
land
so
lone
and
old
its
story
is
of
god
alone
for
man
has
lived
and
gone
away
and
left
but
little
heaps
of
stone
and
all
seems
some
long
yesterday
lo
here
you
learn
how
more
than
fit
and
dignified
is
silence
when
you
hear
the
petty
jeers
of
men
who
point
and
show
their
pointless
wit
the
vastness
of
that
voiceless
plain
its
awful
solitudes
remain
thenceforth
for
aye
a
part
of
you
and
you
are
of
the
favored
few
for
you
have
learn
your
littleness
and
heed
not
names
that
name
you
less
some
silent
red
men
cross
your
track
some
trappers
come
and
go
some
rolling
seas
of
buffalo
break
and
far
away
against
the
breaking
back
like
breakers
of
some
troubled
bay
but
not
a
voice
the
long
lone
day
some
antelope
blow
by
so
some
foxes
shy
and
shoot
to
and
fro
like
weavers
shuttles
as
you
pass
and
now
and
then
from
out
the
grass
you
hear
some
lone
bird
cluck
and
call
a
sharp
keen
call
for
her
lost
brood
that
only
makes
the
solitude
that
mantles
like
some
sombre
pall
seem
deeper
still
and
that
is
all
a
wide
domain
of
mysteries
and
signs
that
men
misunderstand
a
land
of
space
and
dreams
a
land
of
lakes
and
seas
a
land
of
caves
and
caravans
and
lonely
wells
and
pools
a
land
that
hath
its
purposes
and
plans
that
seems
so
like
dead
palestine
save
that
its
wastes
have
no
confine
till
push
against
the
levell
skies
a
land
from
out
whose
depths
shall
rise
the
prophets
yea
the
land
from
out
whose
awful
depths
shall
come
all
clad
in
skins
with
dusty
feet
a
man
fresh
from
his
maker
hand
a
singer
singing
oversweet
a
charmer
charming
very
wise
and
then
all
men
shall
not
be
dumb
nay
not
be
dumb
for
he
shall
say
take
heed
for
i
prepare
the
way
for
weary
feet
lo
from
this
land
of
jordan
streams
and
sand
the
christ
shall
come
when
next
the
race
of
man
shall
look
upon
his
face
xxi
pursuer
and
pursued
who
knows
the
why
he
left
the
breezy
pine
the
fragrant
tamarack
and
vine
red
rose
and
precious
yellow
rose
nay
vasques
held
the
vantage
ground
above
him
by
the
wooded
steep
and
right
nor
left
no
passage
lay
and
there
was
left
him
but
that
way
the
way
through
blood
or
to
the
deep
and
lonesome
deserts
far
profound
that
know
not
sight
of
man
or
sound
hot
vasques
stood
upon
the
rim
high
bold
and
fierce
with
crag
and
spire
he
saw
a
far
gray
eagle
swim
he
saw
a
black
hawk
wheel
retire
and
shun
that
desert
wide
but
saw
no
other
living
thing
high
in
the
full
sun
gold
and
flame
he
halting
and
half
waiting
came
and
stood
below
the
belt
of
wood
then
moved
along
the
broken
hill
and
looked
below
and
long
he
stood
with
lips
set
firm
and
brow
and
warring
with
his
iron
will
he
mark
the
black
line
winding
down
as
if
into
the
doors
of
death
and
as
he
gazed
a
breath
arose
as
from
his
foes
so
hot
it
almost
took
his
breath
his
black
eye
flashed
an
angry
fire
he
stood
upon
the
mountain
brow
with
lifted
arm
like
oaken
bough
the
hot
pursuer
halting
stood
irresolute
in
nettled
ire
then
look
against
the
cooling
wood
then
strode
he
sullen
to
and
fro
then
turned
and
long
he
gazed
below
the
sands
flash
back
like
fields
of
snow
like
far
blown
seas
that
flood
and
flow
the
while
the
rounded
sky
rose
higher
and
cleaving
through
the
upper
space
the
flush
sun
settled
to
his
place
like
some
far
hemisphere
of
fire
and
yet
again
he
gazed
and
now
far
off
and
faint
he
saw
or
he
saw
beyond
the
sands
a
dim
and
distant
lifting
beach
that
daring
men
might
dare
and
reach
dim
shapes
of
toppled
peaks
with
pine
and
water
dark
like
wine
and
fruits
on
many
a
bended
bough
the
leader
turn
and
shook
his
head
and
shall
we
turn
aside
he
said
or
dare
this
hell
the
men
stood
still
as
leaning
on
his
sterner
will
and
then
he
stopp
and
turn
again
and
held
his
broad
hand
to
his
brow
and
looked
intent
and
eagerly
the
far
white
levels
of
the
plain
flash
back
like
billows
even
now
he
saw
rise
up
remote
sea
space
wastes
nothingness
a
ship
becalm
as
in
distress
the
dim
sign
pass
as
suddenly
a
gossamer
of
golden
tress
thrown
over
some
still
middle
sea
and
then
his
eager
eyes
grew
dazed
he
brought
his
two
hands
to
his
face
again
he
raised
his
head
and
gazed
with
flashing
eyes
and
visage
fierce
far
out
and
resolute
to
pierce
the
far
far
faint
receding
reach
of
space
and
touch
its
farther
beach
he
saw
but
space
unbounded
space
eternal
space
and
nothingness
then
all
wax
anger
as
they
gazed
far
out
upon
the
shoreless
land
and
clench
their
doubled
hands
and
raised
their
long
bare
arms
but
utter
not
at
last
one
started
from
the
band
his
bosom
heaved
as
billows
heave
great
heaving
bosom
broad
and
brown
he
raised
his
arm
push
up
his
sleeve
push
bare
his
arm
strode
up
and
down
with
hat
pushed
back
and
flushed
and
hot
and
shot
sharp
oaths
like
cannon
shot
again
the
man
stood
still
again
he
strode
the
height
like
hoary
storm
then
shook
his
fists
and
then
his
form
did
writhe
as
if
it
writhed
with
pain
and
yet
again
his
face
was
raised
and
yet
again
he
gazed
and
gazed
above
his
fading
failing
foe
with
gather
brow
and
visage
fierce
as
if
his
soul
would
part
or
pierce
the
awful
depths
that
lay
below
he
had
as
well
look
on
that
sea
that
keeps
samoa
coral
isles
amid
ten
thousand
watery
miles
bound
round
by
one
eternity
bound
round
by
realms
of
nothingness
in
love
with
their
own
loneliness
he
saw
but
space
unbounded
space
and
brought
his
brown
hands
to
his
face
there
roll
away
to
left
to
right
unbroken
walls
as
black
as
night
and
back
of
these
there
distant
rose
steep
cones
of
everlasting
snows
at
last
he
was
resolved
his
form
seem
like
a
pine
blown
rampt
with
storm
he
mounted
clutch
his
reins
and
then
turn
sharp
and
savage
to
his
men
and
silent
then
led
down
the
way
to
night
that
knows
not
night
nor
day
xxii
like
some
great
serpent
black
and
still
old
morgan
men
stole
down
the
hill
far
down
the
steep
they
wound
and
wound
until
the
black
line
touched
that
land
of
gleaming
white
and
silver
sand
that
knows
not
human
sight
or
sound
how
broken
plunged
the
steep
descent
how
barren
desolate
and
rent
by
earthquake
shock
the
land
lay
dead
with
dust
and
ashes
on
its
head
was
as
some
old
world
overthrown
where
theseus
fought
and
sappho
dreamed
in
eons
ere
they
touched
this
land
and
found
their
proud
souls
foot
and
hand
bound
to
the
flesh
and
stung
with
pain
an
ugly
skeleton
it
of
its
own
self
the
fiery
rain
of
red
volcanoes
here
had
sown
the
death
of
cities
of
the
plain
the
very
devastation
gleamed
all
burnt
and
black
and
rent
and
seam
ay
vanquished
quite
and
overthrown
and
torn
with
and
strown
with
cinders
lo
the
dead
earth
lay
as
waiting
for
the
judgment
day
why
tamer
men
had
turn
and
said
on
seeing
this
with
start
and
dread
and
whisper
each
with
gather
breath
we
come
on
the
confines
of
death
they
wound
below
a
savage
bluff
that
lifted
from
its
base
great
walls
with
characters
cut
rough
and
deep
by
some
race
and
lo
strange
beasts
unnamed
unknown
stood
hewn
and
limn
upon
the
stone
the
iron
hoofs
sank
here
and
there
plough
deep
in
ashes
broke
anew
old
broken
idols
and
laid
bare
old
bits
of
vessels
that
had
grown
as
countless
ages
cycled
through
imbedded
with
the
common
stone
a
mournful
land
as
land
can
be
beneath
their
feet
in
ashes
lay
beside
that
dread
and
sea
a
city
older
than
that
gray
and
tower
builded
when
confusion
cursed
the
tongues
of
men
beneath
before
a
city
lay
that
in
her
majesty
had
shamed
the
conqueror
of
old
below
before
and
far
away
there
reach
the
white
arm
of
a
bay
a
broad
bay
shrunk
to
sand
and
stone
where
ships
had
rode
and
breakers
when
babylon
was
yet
unnamed
and
nimrod
unknown
some
serpents
slid
from
out
the
grass
that
grew
in
tufts
by
shatter
stone
then
hid
beneath
some
broken
mass
that
time
had
eaten
as
a
bone
is
eaten
by
some
savage
beast
an
everlasting
palace
feast
a
rattlesnake
that
lay
all
loathsome
and
slept
coil
tight
as
in
the
sun
with
flat
head
through
the
centre
run
struck
blindly
back
then
rattling
crept
down
the
dusty
way
was
all
the
dead
land
had
to
say
two
hawks
and
gray
scream
savagely
and
circling
high
and
screaming
still
in
mad
dismay
grew
dim
and
died
against
the
sky
was
all
the
heavens
had
to
say
the
grasses
fail
and
then
a
mass
of
brown
burnt
cactus
ruled
the
land
and
topt
the
hillocks
of
hot
sand
where
scarce
the
hornèd
toad
could
pass
then
stunted
sage
on
either
hand
all
loud
with
odors
spread
the
land
the
sun
rose
right
above
and
fell
as
falling
molten
as
they
pass
some
junipers
at
last
the
last
that
the
desert
look
and
black
as
shapes
of
hell
where
dumb
owls
sat
with
bent
bills
beneath
their
wings
awaiting
night
rose
up
then
faded
from
the
sight

not
another

the

shot

a

still
keep

and
murmur
not
keep
stern
and
still
as

king

it
was
a

a

slid
and
still
along
the
sand
the

stopp
leap
up

lick
a

a

chid
him
back

his

when

turn
his

his

had
fallen

the

hung
white
with

far
away
a
lifted
shining
lay
as
if
to
mock
their

retreat
the

did
make
the

loom
as
grand
from

on

upon

were
silent
as

dead
the

overhead
nor

found

came
a
feeble
shot

strangely
in

vastness
there
it
seem
to
scarcely
fret
the

fell
down
harmless
anywhere
he
fiercely
hail

there
fell

fell
down

cursed

seem
to
fall

on

morgan
silent
on

as
he
rode
he
lean
and
drew
from
his
catenas
gold
and
threw
the
bright

in
the
glaring
sun

vasques
did
not
heed
a
whit
he
scarcely
deign
to
scowl
at
it
again
lean
morgan
he
uprose
and
held
a
high
hand
to
his
foes
and
held
two
goblets
up

did
shine
as
if
itself
a

then
leaning
backward
from

he
hurl
them
in
his
foemen
face

drew
again
and
so
kept
on

goblets
gold

all
were
gone

strew
them
out

seek
he
does
not

the

a

he

not

to
look
at
it

now
his
gleaming
steel
is
drawn
and
now
he
leans
would
hail
again
he
opes
his
swollen
lips
in
vain
but
look
you
see
a
lifted
hand
and
vasques
beckons
his
command
he
can
not
speak
he
leans
and
he
bends
low
upon
his
and

his
blade
drops
to
his
knee

falters
now
comes
on

now
his

is
bended
low

now
his

his
steel
is
gone
now
faint
as
any

is
he
and
now
his
steed
sinks
to

the

hung
molten
in
mid
space
like
some
great
star
fix
in
its
place
from
out
the
gleaming
spaces
rose
a
sheen
of
gossamer
and
danced
as
morgan
slow
and
still
advanced
before
his
foes
right
on
and
on
the
still
black
line
drove
straight
through
gleaming
sand
and
shine
by
spar
and
beam
and
mast
and
stray
and
waif
of
sea
and
the
far
peaks
faded
from
their
sight
the
mountain
walls
fell
down
like
night
and
nothing
now
was
to
be
seen

but
the
dim
sun
hung
in
sheen
of
fairy
garments
all
the
hell
beneath
the
hell
a
black
man
tumbled
from
his
steed
he
clutch
in
death
the
moving
sands
he
caught
the
round
earth
in
his
hands
he
gripp
it
held
it
hard
and
grim
the
great
sad
mother
did
not
heed
his
hold
but
pass
right
on
from
him
and
ere
he
died
grew
far
and
dim
xxviii
the
sun
seem
broken
loose
at
last
and
settled
slowly
to
the
west
half
hidden
as
he
fell
yet
like
the
flying
parthian
cast
his
keenest
arrows
as
he
pass
on
on
the
black
men
slowly
drew
their
length
like
some
great
serpent
through
the
sands
and
left
a
hollow
groove
they
march
they
scarcely
seem
to
move
how
patient
in
their
muffled
tread
how
like
the
dead
march
of
the
dead
at
last
the
slow
black
line
was
check
an
instant
only
now
again
it
moved
it
falter
now
and
now
it
settled
in
its
sandy
bed
and
steeds
stood
rooted
to
the
plain
then
all
stood
still
and
men
somehow
look
down
and
with
averted
head
look
down
nor
dared
look
up
nor
of
any
thing
of
ill
or
good
but
bowed
and
stricken
still
they
stood
like
some
brave
band
that
dared
the
fierce
and
bristled
steel
of
gather
host
these
daring
men
had
dared
to
pierce
this
awful
vastness
dead
and
gray
and
now
at
last
brought
well
at
bay
they
stood
but
each
stood
to
his
post
each
man
an
unencompassed
host
then
one
dismounted
waved
a
hand
was
morgan
stern
and
still
command
there
fell
a
clash
like
loosen
chain
and
men
dismounting
loosed
the
rein
then
every
steed
stood
loosed
and
free
and
some
stepp
slow
and
mute
aside
and
some
sank
to
the
sands
and
died
and
some
stood
still
as
shadows
be
and
men
stood
gazing
silently
xxix
old
morgan
turn
and
raised
his
hand
and
laid
it
level
with
his
eyes
and
look
far
back
along
the
land
he
saw
a
dark
dust
still
uprise
still
surely
tend
to
where
he
lay
he
did
not
curse
he
did
not
say
he
did
not
even
look
surprise
but
silent
turned
to
her
his
eyes
nay
he
was
now
he
wiped
a
time
his
titan
brow
then
sought
dark
ina
in
her
place
put
out
his
arms
put
down
his
face
and
look
in
hers
she
reach
her
hands
she
lean
she
fell
upon
his
breast
he
reach
his
arms
around
she
lay
as
lies
a
bird
in
leafy
nest
and
he
look
out
across
the
sands
and
then
his
face
fell
down
he
smiled
and
softly
said
my
child
my
child
then
bent
his
head
and
strode
away
and
as
he
strode
he
turn
his
head
he
sidewise
cast
his
brief
commands
he
led
right
on
across
the
sands
they
rose
and
follow
where
he
led
xxx
was
so
like
night
the
sun
was
dim
some
black
men
settled
down
to
rest
but
none
made
murmur
or
request
the
dead
were
dead
and
that
were
best
the
living
leaning
follow
him
in
huddled
heaps
half
nude
and
grim
the
day
through
high
rode
across
the
sky
the
dim
red
day
awest
the
warlike
strode
with
shoulder
shield
away
away
the
savage
warlike
day
bent
low
as
reapers
bend
in
gathering
grain
as
archer
bending
bends
yew
bow
and
flush
and
fretted
as
in
pain
then
down
his
shoulder
slid
his
shield
so
huge
so
awful
so
and
batter
as
from
it
settled
sunk
to
his
left
hand
sunk
down
and
down
it
touch
the
sand
then
day
along
the
land
lay
dead
without
one
candle
at
his
head
xxxi
and
now
the
moon
wheel
white
and
vast
a
round
unbroken
marbled
moon
and
touch
the
far
bright
buttes
of
snow
then
climb
their
shoulders
over
soon
and
there
she
seem
to
sit
at
last
to
hang
to
hover
there
to
grow
grow
vaster
than
vast
peaks
of
snow
grow
whiter
than
the
snow
own
breast
grow
softer
than
september
noon
until
the
seem
at
best
but
one
wide
shining
shatter
moon
she
sat
the
battlements
of
time
she
shone
in
mail
of
frost
and
rime
a
time
and
then
rose
up
and
stood
in
heaven
in
sad
widowhood
the
faded
moon
fell
wearily
and
then
the
sun
right
suddenly
rose
up
full
arm
and
rushing
came
across
the
land
like
flood
of
flame
xxxii
the
sun
roll
on
lo
hills
uprose
as
push
against
the
arching
skies
as
if
to
meet
the
timid
sun
rose
sharp
from
out
the
sultry
dun
set
well
with
wood
and
brier
and
rose
and
seem
to
hold
the
free
repose
of
lands
where
rocky
summits
rise
or
unfenced
fields
of
paradise
the
black
men
look
up
from
the
sands
against
the
dim
uncertain
skies
as
men
that
disbelieved
their
eyes
and
would
have
laugh
they
wept
instead
with
shoulders
heaved
with
bowing
head
hid
down
between
their
two
black
hands
they
stood
and
gazed
lo
like
the
call
of
promises
the
trees
lean
from
their
lifted
mountain
wall
and
stood
clear
cut
against
the
skies
as
if
they
grew
in
yet
all
the
mountains
answer
not
and
yet
there
came
no
cooling
breeze
nor
soothing
sense
of
windy
trees
at
last
old
morgan
looking
through
his
shaded
fingers
let
them
go
and
let
his
load
fall
down
as
dead
he
groan
he
clutch
his
beard
of
snow
as
was
his
wont
then
bowing
low
took
up
his
life
and
moaning
said
lord
christ
is
the
mirage
and
we
stand
blinded
in
a
burning
sea
o
sweet
deceit
when
minds
despair
o
mad
deceit
of
man
betray
o
mother
nature
thou
art
fair
but
thou
art
false
as
man
or
maid
yea
many
lessons
mother
earth
have
we
thy
children
learn
of
thee
in
sweet
deceit
the
sudden
birth
of
hope
that
dies
mocks
destiny
o
mother
earth
thy
promises
are
fallen
leaves
they
lie
forgot
such
lessons
how
could
we
learn
less
we
are
but

blame
us
not
xxxiii
again
they
move
but
where
or
how
it
recks
them
little
nothing
now
yet
morgan
leads
them
as
before
but
totters
now
he
bends
and
he
is
like
a
broken
ship
a
ship
that
knows
not
any
shore
and
knows
it
shall
not
anchor
more
some
leaning
shadows
crooning
crept
through
desolation
crown
in
dust
and
had
the
mad
pursuer
kept
his
path
and
cherished
his
pursuit
there
lay
no
choice
advance
he
must
advance
and
eat
his
ashen
fruit
yet
on
and
on
old
morgan
led
his
black
men
totter
to
and
fro
a
leaning
huddled
heap
of
woe
then
one
fell
down
then
two
fell
dead
yet
not
one
moaning
word
was
said
they
made
no
sign
they
said
no
word
nor
lifted
once
black
helpless
hands
and
all
the
time
no
sound
was
heard
save
but
the
dull
dead
muffled
tread
of
shuffled
feet
in
shining
sands
again
the
still
moon
rose
and
stood
above
the
dim
dark
belt
of
wood
above
the
buttes
above
the
snow
and
bent
a
sad
sweet
face
below
she
reach
along
the
level
plain
her
long
white
fingers
then
again
she
reach
she
touch
the
snowy
sands
then
reach
far
out
until
she
a
heap
that
lay
with
doubled
hands
reach
from
its
sable
self
and
with
death
o
tenderly
that
black
that
dead
and
hollow
face
was
kiss
at
midnight
what
if
i
say
the
long
white
moonbeams
reaching
there
caressing
idle
hands
of
clay
and
resting
on
the
wrinkled
hair
and
great
lips
push
in
sullen
pout
were
god
own
fingers
reaching
out
from
heaven
to
that
lonesome
place
xxxiv
by
waif
and
stray
and
such
as
are
seen
in
seas
withdrawn
old
morgan
led
in
silence
on
and
sometime
lifting
up
his
head
to
guide
his
footsteps
as
he
led
he
deem
he
saw
a
great
ship
lay
her
keel
along
the
sand
as
with
her
captain
old
command
the
stars
were
seal
and
then
a
haze
of
gossamer
fill
all
the
west
so
like
in
indian
summer
days
and
veil
all
things
and
then
the
moon
grew
pale
and
faint
and
far
she
died
and
now
nor
star
nor
any
sign
fell
out
of
heaven
oversoon
some
black
men
fell
then
at
their
side
some
one
sat
down
to
watch
to
rest
to
rest
to
watch
or
what
you
will
the
man
sits
resting
watching
still
xxxv
the
day
glared
through
the
eastern
rim
of
rocky
peaks
as
prison
bars
with
light
as
dim
as
distant
stars
the
sultry
sunbeams
filter
down
through
misty
phantoms
weird
and
dim
through
shifting
shapes
brown
like
some
vast
ruin
wrapp
in
flame
the
sun
fell
down
before
them
now
behind
them
wheel
white
peaks
of
snow
as
they
proceeded
gray
and
grim
and
awful
objects
went
and
came
before
them
then
they
pierced
at
last
the
desert
middle
depths
and
lo
there
loom
from
out
the
desert
vast
a
lonely
ship
and
trim
and
perfect
all
in
hull
and
mast
no
storm
had
stain
it
any
whit
no
seasons
set
their
teeth
in
it
her
masts
were
white
as
ghosts
and
tall
her
decks
were
as
of
yesterday
the
rains
the
elements
and
all
the
moving
things
that
bring
decay
by
fair
green
lands
or
fairer

had
touch
not
here
for
centuries
lo
date
had
lost
all
reckoning
and
time
had
long
forgotten
all
in
this
lost
land
and
no
new
thing
or
old
could
anywise
befall
or
morrows
or
a
yesterday
for
time
went
by
the
other
way
the
ages
have
not
any
course
across
this
untrack
waste
the
sky
wears
here
one
blue
unbending
hue
the
heavens
one
unchanging
mood
the
far
still
stars
they
filter
through
the
heavens
falling
bright
and
bold
against
the
sands
as
beams
of
gold
the
wide
white
moon
forgets
her
force
the
very
sun
rides
round
and
high
as
if
to
shun
this
solitude
what
dreams
of

or
conquest

to
these

ere

old

unsatisfied
rose
up
and
shook

in
disgust
from

the

lay
heaved
as
heaved
by
waves
as
fashion
in
a
thousand
graves
and
wrecks
of
storm
blown
here
and
there
and
dead
men
scatter
everywhere
and
strangely
clad
they
seem
to
be
just
as
they
sank
in
that
old
sea
the
mermaid
with
her
splendid
hair
had
clung
about
a
wreck
beam
there
and
sung
her
song
of
sweet
despair
the
time
she
saw
the
seas
withdrawn
and
all
her
home
and
glory
gone
had
sung
her
melancholy
dirge
above
the
last
receding
surge
and
looking
down
the
rippled
tide
had
sung
and
with
her
song
had
died
the
monsters
of
the
sea
lay
bound
in
strange
contortions
coil
around
a
mast
half
heaved
above
the
sand
the
great
folds
were
found
as
solid
as
ship
iron
band
and
basking
in
the
burning
sun
there
rose
the
great
whale
skeleton
a
thousand
sea
things
stretch
across
their
weary
and
bewilder
way
great
unnamed
monsters
wrinkled
lay
with
sunken
eyes
and
shrunken
form
the
strong
that
rode
the
storm
with
mane
as
light
and
white
as
floss
lay
tangled
in
his
mane
of
moss
and
anchor
hull
and
and
all
things
that
the
miser
deep
doth
in
his
darkling
locker
keep
to
right
and
left
around
them
lay
yea
coins
lay
there
on
either
hand
lay
shining
in
the
silver
sand
as
plenty
in
the
wide
sands
lay
as
stars
along
the
milky
way
and
golden
coin
and
golden
cup
and
golden
cruse
and
golden
plate
and
all
that
great
seas
swallow
up
right
in
their
dreadful
pathway
lay
the
hungry
and
insatiate
old
sea
made
hoary
white
with
time
and
wrinkled
cross
with
many
a
crime
with
all
his
treasured
thefts
was
there
his
sins
his
very
soul
laid
bare
as
if
it
were
the
judgment
day
xxxvii
and
now
the
tawny
night
fell
soon
and
there
was
neither
star
nor
moon
and
yet
it
seem
it
was
not
night
there
fell
a
phosphorescent
light
there
rose
from
white
sands
and
dead
men
a
soft
light
white
and
fair
as
when
the
spirit
of
jehovah
moved
upon
the
water
conscious
face
and
made
it
his
o
mighty
waters
unreproved
thou
deep
where
the
jehovah
moved
ere
soul
of
man
was
called
to
be
o

that
were
created
not
as

as
earth
as
light
as
aught
that
is
o

thou
art

a
terror
death
eternity
xxxviii
i
do
recall
some
sad
days
spent
by
borders
of
the
orient
days
sweet
as
sad
to
memory
make
a
tale
it
matters
not
i
sought
the
loneliest
seas
i
sought
the
solitude
of
ruins
and
forgot
mine
own
lone
life
and
littleness
before
this
fair
land
mute
distress
that
sat
within
this
changeful
sea
slow
sailing
through
the
reedy
isles
by
unknown
banks
through
unknown
bays
some
sunny
summer
yesterdays
where
nature
beauty
still
beguiles
i
saw
the
storied
yellow
sail
and
lifted
prow
of
steely
mail
is
all
that
left
torcello
now
a
pirate
yellow
sail
a
prow
below
the
far
faint
peaks
of
snow
and
causeways
well
below
i
touched
torcello
once
i
took
a
in
my
hand
and
blew
like
any
trumpeter
i
felt
the
lift
and
stir
on
trees
that
reached
from
ruined
wall
above
my
head
but
that
was
all
back
from
the
farther
island
shore
came
echoes
trooping
nothing
more
lo
here
stood
adria
once
and
here
attila
came
with
sword
and
flame
and
set
his
throne
of
hollowed
stone
in
her
high
mart
and
it
remains
still
lord
all
where
once
the
tears
of
mute
petition
fell
the
rains
of
heaven
fall
lo
all
alone
there
lifts
this
massive
empty
throne
the
sea
has
changed
his
meed
his
mood
and
made
this
sedgy
solitude
by
cattle
paths
and
worn
through
marbled
streets
all
stain
and
torn
by
time
and
battle
there
i
walked
a
bent
old
beggar
white
as
one
for
better
fruitage
blossoming
came
on
and
as
he
came
he
talked
unto
himself
for
there
are
none
in
all
his
island
old
and
dim
to
answer
back
or
question
him
i
turned
retraced
my
steps
once
more
the
hot
miasma
steamed
and
rose
in
deadly
vapor
from
the
reeds
that
grew
from
out
the
shallow
shore
where
peasants
say
the
feeds
and
neptune
shapes
his
horn
and
blows
i
climb
and
sat
that
throne
of
stone
to
contemplate
to
dream
to
reign
ay
reign
above
myself
to
call
the
people
of
the
past
again
before
me
as
i
sat
alone
in
all
my
kingdom
there
were
kine
that
browsed
along
the
reedy
brine
and
now
and
then
a
tusky
boar
would
shake
the
high
reeds
of
the
shore
a
bird
blow
by
but
that
was
all
i
watched
the
lonesome
pass
i
did
remember
and
forget
the
past
rolled
by
i
stood
alone
i
sat
the
shapely
chiselled
stone
that
stands
in
tall
sweet
grasses
set
ay
girdle
deep
in
long
strong
grass
and
green
alfalfa
very
fair
the
heavens
were
and
still
and
blue
for
nature
knows
no
changes
there
the
alps
of
venice
far
away
like
some
half
moon
lay
how
sweet
the
grasses
at
my
feet
the
smell
of
clover
over
sweet
i
heard
the
hum
of
bees
the
bloom
of
and
were
being
rifled
by
the
bees
and
these
were
building
in
a
tomb
the
fair
alfalfa
such
as
has
usurped
the
occident
and
grows
with
all
the
sweetness
of
the
rose
on
sacramento
sundown
hills
is
there
and
that
mid
island
fills
with
fragrance
yet
the
smell
of
death
comes
riding
in
on
every
breath
lo
death
that
is
not
death
but
rest
to
step
aside
to
watch
and
wait
beside
the
wave
outside
the
gate
with
all
life
pulses
in
your
breast
to
absolutely
rest
to
pray
in
some
lone
mountain
while
you
may
that
sad
sweet
fragrance
it
had
sense
and
sound
and
voice
it
was
a
part
of
that
which
had
possessed
my
heart
and
would
not
of
my
will
go
hence
was
autumn
breath
was
dear
as
kiss
of
any
worshipped
woman
is
some
snails
have
climb
the
throne
and
writ
their
silver
monograms
on
it
in
unknown
tongues
i
sat
thereon
i
dreamed
until
the
day
was
gone
i
blew
again
my
pearly
shell
blew
long
and
strong
and
loud
and
well
i
puffed
my
cheeks
i
blew
as
when
horn
satyrs
danced
the
delight
of
men
some
cows
that
fed
within
looked
up
a
cowherd
rose
hard
by
my
single
subject
clad
in
skin
nor
yet
half
clad
i
caught
his
eye
he
stared
at
me
then
turned
and
fled
he
frightened
fled
and
as
he
ran
like
wild
beast
from
the
face
of
man
across
his
shoulder
threw
his
head
he
gathered
up
his
skin
of
goat
about
his
breast
and
hairy
throat
he
stopped
and
then
this
subject
true
mine
only
one
in
lands
like
these
made
desolate
by
changeful
seas
came
back
and
asked
me
for
a
xxxix
and
yet
again
through
the
watery
miles
of
reeds
i
rowed
till
the
desolate
isles
of
the
black
of
venice
are
not
i
touched
where
a
single
sharp
tower
is
shot
to
heaven
and
torn
by
thunder
and
rent
as
if
it
had
been
time
battlement
a
city
lies
dead
and
this
great
gravestone
stands
at
its
head
like
a
ghost
alone
some
grow
here
and
here
an
old
church
simple
and
severe
in
ancient
aspect
stands
alone
amid
the
ruin
and
decay
all
grown
in
moss
and
grasses
old
and
quaint
with
antique
cuts
of
martyr
saint
the
gray
church
stands
with
stooping
knees
defying
the
decay
of
seas
her
pictured
hell
with
flames
blown
high
in
bright
mosaics
wrought
and
set
when
man
first
knew
the
nubian
art
her
bearded
saints
as
black
as
jet
her
quaint
madonna
dim
with
rain
and
touch
of
pious
lips
of
pain
so
touched
my
lonesome
soul
that
i
gazed
long
then
came
and
gazed
again
and
loved
and
took
her
to
my
heart
nor
monk
in
black
nor
capuchin
nor
priest
of
any
creed
was
seen
a
woman
old
and
tall
and
still
as
any
shadow
is
stole
forth
from
out
the
mossy
wall
with
massive
keys
to
show
me
this
came
slowly
forth
and
following
three
birds
and
all
with
drooping
wing
three
mute
brown
babes
of
hers
and
they
o
they
were
beautiful
as
sleep
or
death
below
the
troubled
deep
and
on
the
pouting
lips
of
these
red
corals
of
the
silent
seas
sweet
birds
the
everlasting
seal
of
silence
that
the
god
has
set
on
this
dead
island
sits
for
aye
i
would
forget
yet
not
forget
their
helpless
eloquence
they
creep
somehow
into
my
heart
and
keep
one
bleak
cold
corner
jewel
set
they
steal
my
better
self
away
to
them
as
little
birds
that
day
stole
fruits
from
out
the
so
helpless
and
so
wholly
still
so
sad
so
wrapt
in
mute
surprise
that
i
did
love
despite
my
will
one
little
maid
of
ten
such
eyes
so
large
and
lonely
so
divine
such
pouting
lips
such
peachy
cheek
did
lift
her
perfect
eyes
to
mine
until
our
souls
did
touch
and
speak
stood
by
me
all
that
perfect
day
yet
not
one
sweet
word
could
she
say
she
turned
her
melancholy
eyes
so
constant
to
my
own
that
i
forgot
the
going
clouds
the
sky
found
fellowship
took
bread
and
wine
and
so
her
little
soul
and
mine
stood
very
near
together
there
and
o
i
found
her
very
fair
yet
not
one
soft
word
could
she
say
what
did
she
think
of
all
that
day
the
sometime
song
of
gondolier
is
heard
afar
the
fishermen
betimes
draw
net
by
ruined
shore
in
full
spring
time
when
east
winds
fall
then
traders
row
with
muffled
oar
tedesca
or
the
turban
turk
the
pirate
at
some
midnight
work
by
watery
wall
but
that
is
all
xl
remote
around
the
lonesome
ship
old
morgan
moved
but
knew
it
not
for
neither
star
nor
moon
fell
down
i
trow
that
was
a
lonesome
spot
he
found
where
boat
and
ship
did
dip
in
sands
like
some
town
and
all
things
rose
and
brown
at
last
before
the
leader
lay
a
form
that
in
the
night
did
seem
a
slain
goliath
as
in
a
dream
he
drew
aside
in
his
slow
pace
and
look
he
saw
a
sable
face
a
friend
that
fell
that
very
day
thrown
straight
across
his
wearied
way
he
falter
now
his
iron
heart
that
never
yet
refused
its
part
began
to
fail
him
and
his
strength
shook
at
his
knees
as
shakes
the
wind
a
shatter
ship
his
scatter
mind
ranged
up
and
down
the
land
at
length
he
turn
as
ships
turn
tempest
toss
for
now
he
knew
that
he
was
lost
and
sought
in
vain
the
moon
the
stars
in
vain
the
of
mars
again
he
moved
and
now
again
he
paused
he
peer
along
the
plain
another
form
before
him
lay
he
stood
and
he
stood
he
trembled
like
a
stormy
wood
it
was
a
foeman
brown
and
gray
he
lifted
up
his
head
again
again
he
search
the
great
profound
for
moon
for
star
but
sought
in
vain
he
kept
his
circle
round
and
round
the
great
ship
lifting
from
the
sand
and
pointing
heavenward
like
a
hand
xli
and
still
he
crept
along
the
plain
yet
where
his
foeman
dead
again
lay
in
his
way
he
moved
around
and
soft
as
if
on
sacred
ground
and
did
not
touch
him
anywhere
it
might
have
been
he
had
a
dread
in
his
and
fever
brain
his
mortal
foe
might
wake
again
if
he
should
dare
to
touch
him
there
he
circled
round
the
lonesome
ship
like
some
wild
beast
within
a
wall
that
keeps
his
paces
round
and
round
the
very
stillness
had
a
sound
he
saw
strange
somethings
rise
and
dip
he
felt
the
weirdness
like
a
pall
come
down
and
cover
him
it
to
take
a
form
take
many
forms
to
talk
to
him
to
reach
out
arms
yet
on
he
kept
and
silent
kept
and
as
he
led
he
lean
and
slept
and
as
he
slept
he
talk
and
dream
then
shadows
follow
stopp
and
stood
bewildered
wandered
back
again
came
on
and
then
fell
to
the
sand
and
sinking
died
then
other
men
did
wag
their
woolly
heads
and
laugh
then
bend
their
necks
and
seem
to
quaff
of
cooling
waves
that
careless
flow
where
woods
and
long
strong
grasses
grow
yet
on
wound
morgan
leaning
low
with
head
upon
his
breast
and
slow
as
hand
upon
a
dial
plate
he
did
not
turn
his
course
or
quail
he
did
not
falter
did
not
fail
turn
right
or
left
or
hesitate
some
sounds
had
lost
their
way
and
seem
to
call
to
him
and
pray
for
help
as
if
they
were
affright
it
was
not
day
it
seem
not
night
but
that
dim
land
that
lies
between
the
mournful
faithful
face
of
night
and
loud
and
day
a
night
that
was
not
felt
but
seen
there
seem
not
then
the
ghost
of
sound
he
stepp
as
soft
as
step
the
dead
yet
on
he
led
in
solemn
tread
bewilder
blinded
round
and
round
about
the
great
black
ship
that
rose
as
that
ship
that
blows
her
ghost
below
lost
panama
the
tallest
mast
man
ever
saw
two
leaning
shadows
follow
him
their
eyes
were
red
their
teeth
shone
white
their
limbs
did
lift
as
shadows
swim
then
one
went
left
and
one
went
right
and
in
the
night
pass
out
of
night
pass
through
the
portals
black
unknown
and
morgan
totter
on
alone
xlii
and
why
he
still
survived
the
rest
why
still
he
had
the
strength
to
stir
why
still
he
stood
like
gnarléd
oak
that
buffets
storm
and
tempest
stroke
one
can
not
say
save
but
for
her
that
helpless
being
on
his
breast
at
rest
that
would
not
let
him
rest
she
did
not
speak
she
did
not
stir
in
rippled
currents
over
her
her
black
abundant
hair
pour
down
like
mantle
or
some
sable
gown
that
sad
sweet
dreamer
she
who
knew
not
any
thing
of
earth
at
all
nor
cared
to
know
its
bane
or
bliss
that
dove
that
did
not
touch
the
land
that
knew
yet
did
not
understand
and
this
may
be
because
she
drew
her
all
of
life
right
from
the
hand
of
god
and
did
not
choose
to
learn
the
things
that
make
up
earth
concern
ah
there
be
souls
none
understand
like
clouds
they
can
not
touch
the
land
drive
as
they
may
by
field
or
town
then
we
look
wise
at
this
and
frown
and
we
cry
fool
and
cry
take
hold
of
earth
and
fashion
gods
of
gold
unanchor
ships
they
blow
and
blow
sail
to
and
fro
and
then
go
down
in
unknown
seas
that
none
shall
know
without
one
ripple
of
renown
poor
drifting
dreamers
sailing
by
they
seem
to
only
live
to
die
call
these
not
fools
the
test
of
worth
is
not
the
hold
you
have
of
earth
lo
there
be
gentlest
souls
that
know
not
any
harbor
known
now
it
may
be
the
reason
is
they
touch
on
fairer
shores
than
this
xliii
and
ina
nestled
there
in
her
glorious
hair
the
while
its
midnight
folds
fell
down
from
out
his
great
arms
nude
and
brown
she
lay
against
his
hairy
breast
all
motionless
as
death
below
his
great
white
beard
like
shroud
or
snow
as
if
in
everlasting
rest
he
totter
side
to
side
to
keep
erect
and
keep
his
steady
tread
he
lean
he
bent
to
her
his
head
she
sleeps
uncommon
sound
he
said
as
if
in
that
eternal
sleep
where
cool
and
watered
willows
sweep
at
last
he
touch
a
fallen
group
dead
fellows
tumbled
in
the
sands
dead
foemen
gather
to
the
dead
and
eager
now
the
man
did
stoop
lay
down
his
load
and
reach
his
hands
and
stretch
his
form
and
look
steadfast
and
frightful
and
as
one
aghast
and
ghostly
from
his
hollow
eyes
he
lean
and
then
he
raised
his
head
and
look
for
vasques
but
in
vain
he
laid
his
two
great
arms
crosswise
took
breath
a
time
with
trembling
main
then
peered
again
along
the
plain
lo
from
the
sands
another
face
the
last
that
follow
through
the
deep
comes
on
from
out
the
lonesome
place
and
vasques
too
survives
but
where
his
last
bold
follower
lies
there
thrown
straight
across
old
morgan
track
as
if
to
check
him
bid
him
back
he
stands
he
does
not
dare
to
stir
he
watches
by
his
child
asleep
he
fears
for
her
but
only
her
the
man
who
ever
mock
at
death
he
hardly
dares
to
draw
his
breath
beyond
and
still
as
black
despair
a
man
rose
up
stood
dark
and
tall
stretch
out
his
neck
reach
forth
let
fall
dark
oaths
and
death
stood
waiting
there
he
drew
his
blade
came
straight
as
death
right
up
before
the
follower
the
last
of
morgan
sable
men
while
morgan
watched
aside
by
her
and
saw
his
foeman
wag
his
beard
and
fiercest
visage
ever
seen
the
while
that
dead
man
lay
between
i
think
no
man
there
drew
a
breath
i
know
that
no
man
quail
or
fear
the
tawny
dead
man
stretch
between
and
vasques
set
his
foot
thereon
the
stars
were
seal
the
moon
was
gone
the
very
darkness
cast
a
shade
the
scene
was
rather
heard
than
seen
the
rattle
of
a
single
blade
a
right
foot
rested
on
the
dead
a
black
hand
reach
and
clutch
a
beard
then
neither
prayed
nor
dreamed
of
hope
a
fierce
face
reach
a
fierce
face
peer
no
bat
went
whirling
overhead
no
star
fell
out
of
ethiope
the
dead
man
lay
between
them
there
the
two
men
glared
as
tigers
glare
the
black
man
held
him
by
the
beard
he
wound
his
hand
he
held
him
fast
and
tighter
held
as
if
he
the
man
might
him
at
the
last
whiles
morgan
did
not
speak
or
stir
but
stood
in
silent
watch
by
her
not
long
a
light
blade
lifted
thrust
a
blade
that
leapt
and
swept
about
so
like
wand
in
spell
so
like
a
serpent
tongue
thrust
out
thrust
twice
thrust
thrice
thrust
as
he
fell
thrust
through
until
it
touch
the
dust
yet
ever
as
he
thrust
and
smote
the
black
hand
like
an
iron
band
did
tighten
to
the
gasping
throat
he
fell
but
did
not
loose
his
hand
the
two
fell
dead
upon
the
sand
lo
up
and
from
the
fallen
forms
two
ghosts
came
forth
like
cloud
of
storms
two
tall
ghosts
stood
and
looking
back
with
hands
all
bloody
and
hands
clutch
strode
on
together
till
they
touch
along
the
lonesome
chartless
track
where
dim
plutonian
darkness
fell
then
touch
the
outer
rim
of
hell
and
looking
back
their
great
despair
sat
sadly
down
as
resting
there
xliv
perchance
there
was
a
strength
in
death
the
scene
it
seem
to
nerve
the
man
to
superhuman
strength
he
rose
held
up
his
head
began
to
scan
the
heavens
and
to
take
his
breath
right
strong
and
lustily
he
now
resumed
his
load
and
with
his
eye
fixed
on
a
star
that
filtered
through
the
farther
west
pushed
bare
his
brow
and
kept
his
course
with
head
held
high
as
if
he
strode
his
deck
and
drew
his
keel
below
some
lifted
light
that
watched
the
rocky
reef
at
night
how
lone
he
was
how
patient
she
upon
that
lonesome
sandy
sea
it
were
a
sad
unpleasant
sight
to
follow
them
through
all
the
night
until
the
time
they
lifted
hand
and
touched
at
last
a
watered
land
the
turkeys
walked
the
tangled
grass
and
scarcely
turned
to
let
them
pass
there
was
no
sign
of
man
or
sign
of
savage
beast
was
so
divine
it
seem
as
if
the
bended
skies
were
rounded
for
this
paradise
the
antelope
came
down
from
off
their
windy
hills
and
blew
their
whistles
as
they
wandered
through
the
open
groves
of
watered
wood
then
came
as
light
as
if
and
reached
their
noses
wet
and
brown
and
stamped
their
little
feet
and
stood
close
up
before
them
wondering
what
if
this
were
the
eden
true
they
found
in
far
heart
of
the
new
and
unnamed
westmost
world
i
sing
where
date
and
history
had
birth
and
man
first
his
wandering
to
go
the
girdles
of
the
earth
it
lies
a
little
isle
mid
land
an
island
in
a
sea
of
sand
with
reedy
waters
and
the
balm
of
an
eternal
summer
air
some
blowy
pines
toss
tall
and
fair
and
there
are
grasses
long
and
strong
and
tropic
fruits
that
never
fail
the
manzinetta
pulp
the
palm
the
prickly
pear
with
all
the
song
of
summer
birds
and
there
the
quail
makes
nest
and
you
may
hear
her
call
all
day
from
out
the
chaparral
a
land
where
white
man
never
trod
and
morgan
seems
some
that
haunts
the
red
man
spirit
land
a
land
where
never
red
man
hand
is
lifted
up
in
strife
at
all
he
holds
it
sacred
unto
those
who
bravely
fell
before
their
foes
and
rarely
dares
its
desert
wall
here
breaks
nor
sound
of
strife
or
sign
rare
times
a
red
man
comes
this
way
alone
and
and
gray
and
then
he
bends
devout
before
the
maid
who
keeps
the
cabin
door
and
deems
her
sacred
and
divine
within
the
island
heart
is
said
tall
trees
are
bending
down
with
bread
and
that
a
fountain
pure
as
truth
and
deep
and
mossy
bound
and
fair
is
bubbling
from
the
forest
there
perchance
the
fabled
fount
of
youth
an
isle
where
never
cares
betide
where
solitude
comes
not
and
where
the
soul
is
ever
satisfied
an
isle
where
skies
are
ever
fair
where
men
keep
never
date
nor
day
where
time
has
thrown
his
glass
away
this
isle
is
all
their
own
no
more
the
flight
by
day
the
watch
by
night
dark
ina
twines
about
the
door
the
scarlet
blooms
the
blossoms
white
and
winds
red
berries
in
her
hair
and
never
knows
the
name
of
care
she
has
a
thousand
birds
they
blow
in
rainbow
clouds
in
clouds
of
snow
the
birds
take
berries
from
her
hand
they
come
and
go
at
her
command
she
has
a
thousand
pretty
birds
that
sing
her
summer
songs
all
day
small
antelope
in
herds
and
squirrels
and
gray
with
round
and
sparkling
eyes
of
pink
and
as
you
can
think
she
has
a
thousand
busy
birds
and
is
she
happy
in
her
isle
with
all
her
feathered
friends
and
herds
for
when
has
morgan
seen
her
smile
she
has
a
thousand
cunning
birds
they
would
build
nestings
in
her
hair
she
has
brown
antelope
in
herds
she
never
knows
the
name
of
care
why
then
is
she
not
happy
there
all
patiently
she
bears
her
part
she
has
a
thousand
birdlings
there
these
birds
they
would
build
in
her
hair
but
not
one
bird
builds
in
her
heart
she
has
a
thousand
birds
yet
she
would
give
ten
thousand
cheerfully
all
bright
of
plume
and
loud
of
tongue
and
sweet
as
ever
trilled
or
sung
for
one
small
fluttered
bird
to
come
and
sit
within
her
heart
though
dumb
she
has
a
thousand
birds
yet
one
is
lost
and
lo
she
is
undone
she
sighs
sometimes
she
looks
away
and
yet
she
does
not
weep
or
say
she
has
a
thousand
birds
the
skies
are
fashioned
for
her
paradise
a
very
queen
of
fairy
land
with
all
earth
fruitage
at
command
and
yet
she
does
not
lift
her
eyes
she
sits
upon
the
water
brink
as
mournful
soul
as
you
can
think
she
has
a
thousand
birds
and
yet
she
will
look
downward
nor
forget
the
fluttered
turtle
dove
the
birdling
love
that
came
that
sang
through
tropic
trees
then
flew
for
aye
across
the
seas
the
waters
kiss
her
feet
above
her
head
the
trees
are
blossoming
and
fragrant
with
eternal
spring
her
birds
her
antelope
are
there
her
birds
they
would
build
in
her
hair
she
only
waits
her
birdling
love
she
turns
she
looks
along
the
plain
imploring
love
to
come
again
