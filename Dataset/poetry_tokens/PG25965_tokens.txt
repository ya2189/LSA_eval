a
blessing

dust
from
lilies

cling
beneath

breasts
of
lakshmi

girdle

unto
wise
ears

end
of
introduction
the
samodadamodaro
the
sports
of
krishna
beautiful
radha
radha
all
in
the
waited
by
the
wood
for
krishna
fair
krishna
the
krishna
with
earthly
love
false
fire
consuming
and
some
one
of
her
maidens
sang
this
song
follows
is
to
the
vasanta
the
yati
i
know
where
krishna
tarries
in
these
early
days
of
spring
when
every
wind
from
warm
malay
brings
fragrance
on
its
wing
brings
fragrance
stolen
far
away
from
thickets
of
the
clove
in
jungles
where
the
bees
hum
and
the
koil
flutes
her
love
he
dances
with
the
dancers
of
a
merry
morrice
one
all
in
the
budding
for
is
sad
to
be
alone
i
know
how
krishna
passes
these
hours
of
blue
and
gold
when
parted
lovers
sigh
to
meet
and
greet
and
closely
hold
hand
fast
in
hand
and
every
branch
upon
the
droops
downward
with
a
hundred
blooms
in
every
bloom
a
bee
he
is
dancing
with
the
dancers
to
a
tone
in
the
soft
awakening
when
is
hard
to
live
alone
where
that
open
at
a
lover
lightest
tread
break
and
for
shame
at
what
they
hear
from
white
blush
modest
red
and
all
the
spears
on
all
the
boughs
of
all
the
seem
ready
darts
to
pierce
the
hearts
of
wandering
youths
and
maids
tis
there
thy
krishna
dances
till
the
merry
drum
is
done
all
in
the
sunny
when
who
can
live
alone
where
the
breaking
forth
of
blossom
on
the
yellow
dazzles
like
kama
sceptre
whom
all
the
world
obeys
and
fill
drowsy
bees
from
pink
delicious
bowls
as
kama
nectared
goblet
steeps
in
languor
human
souls
there
he
dances
with
the
dancers
and
of
radha
thinketh
none
all
in
the
warm
new
when
none
will
live
alone
where
the
breath
of
waving
mâdhvi
pours
incense
through
the
grove
and
silken
mogras
lull
the
sense
with
essences
of
love
the
pale
mogra
whose
perfume
fine
and
faint
can
melt
the
coldness
of
a
maid
the
sternness
of
a
saint
there
dances
with
those
dancers
thine
other
self
thine
own
all
in
the
languorous
when
none
will
live
alone
where
as
if
warm
lips
touched
sealed
eyes
and
waked
them
all
the
bloom
opens
upon
the
mangoes
to
feel
the
sunshine
come
and
atimuktas
wind
their
arms
of
softest
green
about
clasping
the
stems
while
calm
and
clear
great
jumna
spreadeth
out
there
dances
and
there
laughs
thy
love
with
damsels
many
an
one
in
the
rosy
days
of
for
he
will
not
live
alone
this
song
of
jayadev
deep
as
pearl
in
lurketh
in
its
lines
a
wonder
which
the
wise
alone
will
ponder
though
it
seemeth
of
the
earth
heavenly
is
the
music
birth
telling
darkly
of
delights
in
the
wood
of
wasted
nights
of
witless
days
and
fruitless
love
and
false
pleasures
of
the
grove
and
rash
passions
of
the
prime
and
those
dances
of
time
which
seems
so
time
which
pipes
to
ah
so
softly
ah
so
sweetly
that
among
those
featly
krishna
can
not
choose
but
dance
letting
pass
life
greater
yet
the
winds
that
sigh
so
as
they
stir
the
rose
wake
a
sigh
from
krishna
wistfuller
than
those
all
their
faint
breaths
swinging
the
creepers
to
and
fro
pass
like
rustling
arrows
shot
from
kama
bow
thus
among
the
dancers
what
those
zephyrs
bring
strikes
to
krishna
spirit
like
a
darted
sting
and
all
as
if
far
wandered
the
traveller
should
hear
the
bird
of
home
the
koil
with
rich
and
clear
and
there
should
come
one
moment
a
blessed
fleeting
dream
of
the
bees
among
the
mangoes
beside
his
native
stream
so
flash
those
sudden
yearnings
that
sense
of
a
dearer
thing
the
love
and
lack
of
radha
upon
his
soul
in
spring
then
she
the
maid
of
radha
spake
again
and
pointing
far
away
between
the
leaves
guided
her
lovely
mistress
where
to
look
and
note
how
krishna
wantoned
in
the
wood
now
with
this
one
now
that
his
heart
her
prize
panting
with
foolish
passions
and
his
eyes
beaming
with
too
much
love
for
those
fair
girls
fair
but
not
so
as
radha
and
she
sang
follows
is
to
the
râmagirî
the
yati
see
lady
how
thy
krishna
passes
these
idle
hours
decked
forth
in
fold
of
woven
gold
and
crowned
with
and
scented
with
the
sandal
and
gay
with
gems
of
price
rubies
to
mate
his
laughing
lips
and
diamonds
like
his
eyes
in
the
company
of
damsels
who
dance
and
sing
and
play
lies
krishna
laughing
toying
dreaming
his
spring
away
footnote
it
will
be
observed
that
the
gopis
here
personify
the
five
senses
lassen
says
est
puellis
istis
nil
aliud
significar
quam
res
one
with
champâk
wreathed
wooes
him
to
rest
his
head
on
the
dark
pillow
of
her
breast
so
tenderly
outspread
and
his
brow
with
roses
blown
she
fans
a
fragrance
rare
that
falls
on
the
enchanted
sense
like
rain
in
thirsty
air
while
the
company
of
damsels
wave
many
an
odorous
spray
and
krishna
laughing
toying
sighs
the
soft
spring
away
another
gazing
in
his
face
sits
wistfully
apart
searching
it
with
those
looks
of
love
that
leap
from
heart
to
heart
her
eyes
afire
with
shy
desire
veiled
by
their
lashes
black
speak
so
that
krishna
can
not
choose
but
send
the
message
back
in
the
company
of
damsels
whose
bright
eyes
in
a
ring
shine
round
him
with
soft
meanings
in
the
merry
light
of
spring
the
third
one
of
that
dazzling
band
of
dwellers
in
the
wood
body
and
bosom
panting
with
the
pulse
of
youthful
blood
leans
over
him
as
in
his
ear
a
lightsome
thing
to
speak
and
then
with
lip
imprints
a
kiss
below
his
cheek
a
kiss
that
thrills
and
krishna
turns
at
the
silken
touch
to
give
it
back
ah
radha
forgetting
thee
too
much
and
one
with
arch
smile
beckons
him
away
from
jumna
banks
where
the
tall
bamboos
bristle
like
spears
in
and
plucks
his
cloth
to
make
him
come
into
the
where
the
fruit
is
ripe
and
golden
and
the
milk
and
cakes
are
laid
oh
the
mangoes
and
glad
the
feasts
of
spring
and
fair
the
flowers
to
lie
upon
and
sweet
the
dancers
sing
sweetest
of
all
that
temptress
who
dances
for
him
now
with
subtle
feet
which
part
and
meet
in
the
slow
to
the
chime
of
silver
bangles
and
the
beat
of
hands
and
pipe
and
lute
and
cymbal
played
by
the
woodland
bands
so
that
wholly
eye
ear
sense
soul
krishna
is
theirs
in
the
forest
his
heart
forgets
its
home
made
for
heavenly
things
those
woodland
singers
sings
with
those
dancers
dances
featly
gives
back
soft
embraces
sweetly
smiles
on
that
one
toys
with
this
glance
for
glance
and
kiss
for
kiss
meets
the
merry
damsels
fairly
plays
the
round
of
folly
rarely
lapped
in
weather
he
and
those
brown
girls
this
shadowed
earthly
love
in
the
twilight
of
the
grove
dance
and
song
and
soft
caresses
meeting
looks
and
tangled
tresses
jayadev
the
same
hath
writ
that
ye
might
have
gain
of
it
sagely
its
deep
sense
conceiving
and
its
inner
light
believing
how
that
love
the
mighty
master
lord
of
all
the
stars
that
cluster
in
the
sky
swiftest
and
slowest
lord
of
highest
lord
of
lowest
manifests
himself
to
mortals
winning
them
towards
the
portals
of
his
secret
house
the
gates
of
that
bright
paradise
which
waits
the
wise
in
love
ah
human
creatures
even
your
phantasies
are
teachers
mighty
love
makes
sweet
in
seeming
even
krishna
woodland
dreaming
mighty
love
sways
all
alike
from
self
to
selflessness
oh
strike
from
your
eyes
the
veil
and
see
what
love
willeth
him
to
be
who
in
error
but
in
grace
sitteth
with
that
and
those
eyes
whose
rays
of
heaven
unto
are
given
feasts
of
foolish
mirth
with
these
visions
of
the
earth
learning
love
and
love
imparting
yet
with
sense
of
loss
upstarting
the
cloud
that
veils
the
fountains
underneath
the
sandal
mountains
how
as
if
the
sunshine
drew
all
its
being
to
the
blue
it
takes
flight
and
seeks
to
rise
high
into
the
purer
skies
high
into
the
snow
and
frost
on
the
shining
summits
lost
ah
and
how
the
koil
strain
smites
the
traveller
with
pain
when
the
mango
blooms
in
spring
and
koohoo
koohoo
they
sing
pain
of
pleasures
not
yet
won
pain
of
journeys
not
yet
done
pain
of
toiling
without
gaining
pain
gladness
of
still
but
may
he
guide
us
all
to
glory
high
who
laughed
when
radha
glided
hidden
by
and
all
among
those
damsels
free
and
bold
touched
krishna
with
a
soft
mouth
kind
and
cold
and
like
the
others
leaning
on
his
breast
unlike
the
others
left
there
love
unrest
and
like
the
others
joining
in
his
song
unlike
the

i

bend
for
my

grace
while
i
what

he
deem
light

sing
him
strains
which
only
spirits
know
and
make
him
captive
with
the
chain
of
brooding
round
him
and
bestow
kisses
of

then
what
it
tells
to

err
not

with

brown
girls
all
at

him
pause
with
the

of
heart
he
makes
amid
them
all
the
bows
of
their
bent
brows
wound
him
no
more
no
more
for
all
their
sakes
plays
he
one
note
upon
his
amorous
lute
but
lets
the
strings
lie
mute
pensive
as
if
his
parted
lips
should
say
my
feet
with
the
dances
are
weary
the
music
has
dropped
from
the
song
there
is
no
more
delight
in
the
sweet
shadows
what
thing
has
gone
wrong
the
wings
of
the
wind
have
left
fanning
the
palms
of
the
glade
they
are
dead
and
the
blossoms
seem
dying
in
the
place
where
we
played
we
will
play
no
more
beautiful
shadows
a
fancy
came
solemn
and
sad
more
sweet
with
unspeakable
longings
than
the
best
of
the
pleasures
we
had
i
am
not
now
the
krishna
who
kissed
you
that
exquisite
dream
the
vision
i
saw
in
my
dancing
has
spoiled
what
you
seem
ah
delicate
phantoms
that
cheated
with
eyes
that
looked
lasting
and
true
i
awake
i
have
seen
her
my
angel
farewell
to
the
wood
and
to
you
oh
whisper
of
wonderful
pity
oh
fair
face
that
shone
though
thou
be

vision
is

krishna
in
his
heart
throned
radha
and
all
treasonous
follies
chained
he
played
no
more
with
those
first
but
searching
through
the
shadows
of
the
grove
for
loveliest
radha
when
he
found
her
not
faint
with
the
quest
despairing
lonely
lorn
and
pierced
with
shame
for
wasted
love
and
days
he
sate
by
jumna
where
the
canes
are

to
the

enchantress
radha
queen
of

gone
lost
because

i
so
stricken
with
my
foolish
fall
i
could
not
stay
her
out
of
shame
and
fear
she
will
not
hear
in
her
disdain
and
grief
vainly
i
call
and
if
she
heard
what
would
she
do
what
say
how
could
i
make
it
good
that
i
forgot
what
profit
was
it
to
me
night
and
day
to
live
love
dance
and
dream
having
her
not
soul
without
spot
i
wronged
thy
patience
till
it
sighed
away
sadly
i
know
the
truth
ah
even
now
remembering
that
one
look
beside
the
river
softer
the
vexed
eyes
seem
and
the
proud
brow
than
when
the

make
them

my

for
ever
too
late
is

wise
too
far
art
thou
yet
all

long
in

i
woo
thee
and
all
night
long
with
thee
my
dreams
are
sweet
why
then
so
vainly
must
my
steps
pursue
thee
why
can
i
never
reach
thee
to
entreat
low
at
thy
feet
dear
vanished
splendour
till
my
tears
subdue
thee
surpassing
one
i
knew
thou
didst
not
brook
worship
and
a
love
that
wavers
haho
there
is
the
wisdom
i
mistook
therefore
i

with
desperate
endeavours
that
fault
dissevers
me
from
my

astray
condemned
forsook

yet
i
seem
to
feel
to
know
thee

not

which
bleeds
already
wounded
to
the

with
lasting
smart
shot
from
those
brows
that
did
my

reprove
thou
gavest
her
those

slow
as
he
sits
still
unheedful
bending
low
to
play
this
tune
upon
his
lute
while
all
listen
to
catch
the
sadness
musical
and
krishna
wotteth
nought
but
with
set
face
turned
full
toward
radha
sings
on
in
that
place

all
such
souls

the
wisdom

hereunder

she
whom
radha
sent
came
to
the
canes
the
canes
beside
the
river
where
he
lay
with
listless
limbs
and
spirit
weak
from
love
and
she
sang
this
to
krishna
wistfully
follows
is
to
the
karnâta
the
ekatâlî
art
thou
sick
for
radha
she
is
sad
in
turn
heaven
foregoes
its
blessings
if
it
holds
not
thee
all
the
cooling
fragrance
of
sandal
she
doth
spurn
moonlight
makes
her
mournful
with
radiance
silvery
even
the
southern
breeze
blown
fresh
from
pearly
seas
seems
to
her
but
tainted
by
a
dolorous
brine
and
for
thy
sake
discontented
with
a
great
love
overladen
her
soul
comes
here
beside
thee
and
sitteth
down
with
thine
her
soul
comes
here
beside
thee
and
tenderly
and
true
it
weaves
a
subtle
mail
of
proof
to
ward
off
sin
and
pain
a
breastplate
soft
as
with
holy
tears
for
dew
to
guard
thee
from
the
things
that
hurt
and
then
is
gone
again
to
strew
a
blissful
place
with
the
richest
buds
that
grace
kama
sweet
world
a
with
rose
and
jasmine
fair
for
the
hour
when
with
a
love
no
longer
troubled
thou
shalt
find
the
way
to
radha
and
finish
sorrows
there
but
now
her
lovely
face
is
shadowed
by
her
fears
her
glorious
eyes
are
veiled
and
dim
like
moonlight
in
eclipse
by
breaking
krishna
yet
she
paints
you
in
her
tears
with
tender
thoughts
not
krishna
but
brow
and
breast
and
lips
and
form
and
mien
a
king
a
great
and
godlike
thing
and
then
with
bended
head
she
asks
grace
from
the
love
divine
to
keep
thee
discontented
with
the
phantoms
thou
forswearest
till
she
may
win
her
glory
and
thou
be
raised
to
thine
softly
now
she
sayeth
krishna
krishna
come
lovingly
she
prayeth
fair
moon
light
him
home
yet
if
hari
helps
not
moonlight
can
not
aid
ah
the
woeful
radha
ah
the
forest
shade
ah
if
hari
guide
not
moonlight
is
as
gloom
ah
if
moonlight
help
not
how
shall
krishna
come
sad
for
krishna
grieving
in
the
darkened
grove
sad
for
radha
weaving
dreams
of
fruitless
love
soft
strings
to
this
soft
measure
if
thine
ear
would
catch
its
treasure
slowly
dance
to
this
deep
song
let
its
meaning
float
along
with
grave
paces
since
it
tells
of
a
love
that
sweetly
dwells
in
a
tender
distant
glory
past
all
faults
of
mortal
follows
is
to
the
deshâga
the
ekatâlî
krishna
till
thou
come
unto
her
faint
she
lies
with
love
and
fear
even
the
jewels
of
her
necklet
seem
a
load
too
great
to
bear
krishna
till
thou
come
unto
her
all
the
sandal
and
the
flowers
vex
her
with
their
pure
perfection
though
they
grow
in
heavenly
bowers
krishna
till
thou
come
unto
her
fair
albeit
those
bowers
may
be
passion
burns
her
and
love
fire
fevers
her
for
lack
of
thee
krishna
till
thou
come
unto
her
those
divine
lids
dark
and
tender
droop
like
in
dashed
and
heavy
in
their
splendour
krishna
till
thou
come
unto
her
that
which
she
hath
spread
saddens
with
its
empty
place
its
double
pillow
for
one
head
krishna
till
thou
come
unto
her
from
her
palms
she
will
not
lift
the
dark
face
hidden
deep
within
them
like
the
moon
in
cloudy
rift
krishna
till
thou
come
unto
her
angel
though
she
be
thy
love
sighs
and
suffers
waits
and
watches
joyless
those
joys
above
krishna
till
them
come
unto
her
with
the
comfort
of
thy
kiss
deeper
than
thy
loss
o
krishna
must
be
loss
of
radha
bliss
krishna
while
thou
didst
forget
her
her
thy
life
thy
gentle
fate
wonderful
her
waiting
was
her
pity
sweet
her
patience
great
krishna
come
is
grief
untold
to
grieve
her
shame
to
let
her
sigh
come
for
she
is
sick
with
love
and
thou
her
only
remedy
she
sang
and
jayadeva
prays
for
all
and
prays
for
ever
that
great
hari
may
bestow
utmost
bliss
of
loving
so
on
us
all

one
who
wore
the
herdsman

heretofore
to

the
shepherd
threatened

up
from

reared
the
huge
rock
bestow
it
with
a
gracious
hand
albeit
amid
the
woodland
band
clinging
close
in
fond
caresses
krishna
gave
them
ardent
kisses
taking
on
his
lips
divine

stamp

longings
of
krishna
say
i
am
here
oh
if
she
pardons
me
say
where
i
am
and
win
her
softly
hither
so
krishna
to
the
maid
and
willingly
she
came
again
to
radha
and
she
sang
follows
is
to
the
deshivarâdî
the
rupaka
low
whispers
the
wind
from
malaya
overladen
with
love
on
the
hills
all
the
grass
is
burned
yellow
and
the
trees
in
the
grove
droop
with
tendrils
that
mock
by
their
clinging
the
thoughts
of
the
parted
and
there
lies
for
thee
thy
love
to
him
the
moon
silver
is
a
sun
at
midday
the
fever
he
burns
with
is
deeper
than
starlight
can
stay
like
one
who
falls
stricken
by
arrows
with
the
colour
departed
from
all
but
his
red
wounds
so
lies
thy
love
to
the
music
the
banded
bees
make
him
he
closeth
his
ear
in
the
blossoms
their
small
horns
are
blowing
the
clear
but
as
if
every
sting
to
his
bosom
its
smart
had
imparted
low
lies
by
the
edge
of
the
river
thy
love
by
the
edge
of
the
river
far
wandered
from
his
once
beloved
bowers
and
the
haunts
of
his
beautiful
playmates
and
the
beds
strewn
with
flowers
now
thy
name
is
his
playmate
that
only
and
the
hard
rocks
upstarted
from
the
sand
make
the
couch
where
he
lies
thy
krishna
may
hari
fill
each
soul
as
these
gentle
verses
roll
telling
of
the
anguish
borne
by
kindred
ones
asunder
torn
oh
may
hari
unto
each
all
the
lore
of
loving
teach
all
the
pain
and
all
the
bliss
jayadeva
prayeth
this
yea
lady
in
the
spot
he
waits
where
with
thy
kiss
thou
him
utmost
love
and
drew
him
as
none
else
draws
with
thy
look
and
all
day
long
and
all
night
long
his
cry
is
radha
radha
like
a
spell
said
and
in
his
heart
there
lives
no
wish
nor
hope
save
only
this
to
slake
his
spirit
thirst
for
radha
love
with
radha
lips
and
find
peace
on
the
immortal
beauty
of
thy
breast
follows
is
to
the
gurjjarî
the
ekatâlî
mistress
sweet
and
bright
and
holy
meet
him
in
that
place
change
his
cheerless
melancholy
into
joy
and
grace
if
thou
hast
forgiven
vex
not
if
thou
lovest
go
watching
ever
by
the
river
krishna
listens
low
listens
low
and
on
his
reed
there
softly
sounds
thy
name
making
even
mute
things
plead
there
for
his
hope
is
shame
that
while
winds
are
welcome
to
him
if
from
thee
they
blow
mournful
ever
by
the
river
krishna
waits
thee
so
when
a
bird
wing
stirs
the
roses
when
a
leaf
falls
dead
twenty
times
he
recomposes
the
he
has
spread
twenty
times
with
anxious
glances
seeking
thee
in
vain
sighing
ever
by
the
river
krishna
droops
again
loosen
from
thy
foot
the
bangle
lest
its
golden
bell
with
a
tiny
tattling
jangle
any
false
tale
tell
if
thou
fearest
that
the
moonlight
will
thy
glad
face
know
draw
those
dark
braids
lower
lady
but
to
krishna
go
swift
and
still
as
lightning
splendour
let
thy
beauty
come
sudden
gracious
dazzling
tender
to
his
arms
its
home
swift
as
indra
yellow
lightning
shining
through
the
night
glide
to
krishna
lonely
bosom
take
him
love
and
light
grant
at
last
love
utmost
measure
giving
give
the
whole
keep
back
nothing
of
the
treasure
of
thy
priceless
soul
hold
with
both
hands
out
unto
him
thy
chalice
let
him
drain
the
nectar
of
its
dearest
draught
till
not
a
wish
remain
only
go
the
stars
are
setting
and
thy
krishna
grieves
doubt
and
anger
quite
forgetting
hasten
through
the
leaves
wherefore
didst
thou
lead
him
but
for
this
thing
sake
comfort
him
with
pity
radha
or
his
heart
must
break
while
jayadeva
writes
this
rare
tale
of
deep
delights
jayadev
whose
heart
is
given
unto
hari
lord
in
heaven
see
that
ye
too
as
ye
read
with
a
glad
and
humble
heed
bend
your
brows
before
his
face
that
ye
may
have
bliss
and
and
then
the
maid
compassionate
sang
on
lady
most
sweet
for
thy
coming
feet
he
listens
in
the
wood
with
love
faintly
sighing
like
one
he
sends
his
thoughts
afoot
to
meet
his
bride
ah
silent
one
sunk
is
the
sun
the
darkness
falls
as
deep
as
krishna
sorrow
the
chakor
strain
is
not
more
vain
than
mine
and
soon
gray
dawn
will
bring
white
morrow
and
thine
own
bliss
delays
by
this
the
utmost
of
thy
heaven
comes
only
so
when
with
hearts
beating
and
passionate
greeting
parting
is
over
and
the
parted
grow
one
one
for
ever
and
the
old
endeavour
to
be
so
blended
is
assuaged
at
last
and
the
glad
tears
raining
have
nought
remaining
of
doubt
or
and
the
dread
has
passed
out
of
each
face
in
the
close
embrace
that
embracing
will
be
over
the
ache
that
causes
those
mournful
pauses
in
bowers
of
earth
between
lover
and
lover
to
be
no
more
felt
to
fade
to
melt
in
the
strong
certainty
of
joys
immortal
in
the
glad
meeting
and
quick
sweet
greeting
of
lips
that
close
beyond
time
shadowy
portal
and
to
thee
is
given
angel
of
heaven
this
glory
and
this
joy
with
krishna
go
let
him
attain
for
his
long
pain
the
prize
it
promised
see
thee
coming
slow
a
vision
first
but
then
by
glade
and
glen
a
lovely
loving
soul
true
to
its
home
his
queen
his
crown
his
all
at
last
to
fall
upon
his
breast
and
live
there
radha
come
and
come
thou
lord
of
all
unto
whom
the
three
worlds
call
thou
that
didst
in
angry
might
kansa
like
a
comet
smite
thou
that
in
thy
passion
tender
as
incarnate
spell
and
splendour
hung
on
radha
glorious
face
in
the
garb
of
krishna
grace
as
above
the
bloom
the
bee
when
the
honeyed
revelry
is
too
an
one
not
to
hang
and
dally
on
thou
that
art
the
three
worlds
glory
of
life
the
light
of
every
story
the
meaning
and
the
mark
of
love
the
root
and
flower
o
the
sky
above
the
blue
of
bliss
the
heart
of
those
the
lovers
that
which
did
impose
the
gentle
law
that
each
should
be
the
other
and
ends
that
sarga
of
the
gîta
govinda
sakandksilapundarikaksho
the
dhrishtavaikunto
krishna
made
bolder
but
seeing
that
for
all
her
loving
will
the
feet
of
radha
had
not
power
to
leave
their
place
and
go
she
sped
again
that
maiden
and
to
krishna
eager
ears
told
how
it
fared
with
his
sweet
mistress
there
follows
is
to
the
gondakirî
the
rupaka
krishna
is
thou
must
come
she
sang
ever
she
waits
thee
in
heavenly
bower
the
lotus
seeks
not
the
wandering
bee
the
bee
must
find
the
flower
all
the
wood
over
her
deep
eyes
roam
marvelling
sore
where
tarries
the
bee
who
leaves
such
lips
of
nectar
unsought
as
those
that
blossom
for
thee
her
steps
would
fail
if
she
tried
to
come
would
falter
and
fail
with
yearning
weak
at
the
first
of
the
road
they
would
falter
and
pause
and
the
way
is
strange
to
seek
find
her
where
she
is
sitting
then
with
on
ankle
and
arm
wearing
thine
emblems
and
musing
of
nought
but
the
meeting
to
be
glad
warm
to
be
but
wherefore
tarrieth
he
what
can
stay
or
delay
him
go
see
if
the
soul
of
krishna
comes
ten
times
she
sayeth
to
me
so
ten
times
lost
in
a
languorous
swoon
now
he
cometh
he
cometh
she
cries
and
a
lightens
her
eyes
in
the
gloom
and
the
darkness
is
sweet
with
her
sighs
till
watching
in
vain
she
glideth
again
under
the
shade
of
the
whispering
leaves
with
a
heart
too
full
of
its
love
at
last
to
heed
how
her
bosom
heaves
not
these
fair
verses
swell
the
number
of
the
wise
who
dwell
in
the
realm
of
kama
bliss
jayadeva
prayeth
this
jayadev
the
bard
of
love
servant
of
the
gods
for
all
so
strong
in
heaven
itself
is
love
that
radha
sits
drooping
there
her
beautiful
bosoms
panting
with
thought
and
the
braids
drawn
back
from
her
ear
and
angel
albeit
her
rich
lips
breathe
sighs
if
sighs
were
ever
so
sweet
and
if
spirits
can
tremble
she
trembles
now
from
forehead
to
jewelled
feet
and
her
voice
of
music
sinks
to
a
sob
and
her
eyes
like
eyes
of
a
mated
roe
are
tender
with
looks
of
yielded
love
with
dreams
dreamed
long
ago
long
long
ago
but
soon
to
grow
truth
to
end
and
be
waking
and
certain
and
true
of
which
dear
surety
murmur
her
lips
as
the
lips
of
sleepers
do
and
dreaming
she
loosens
her
and
opens
her
arms
to
the
empty
air
then
starts
if
a
leaf
of
the
champâk
falls
sighing
o
leaf
is
he
there
why
dost
thou
linger
in
this
dull
spot
haunted
by
serpents
and
evil
for
thee
why
not
hasten
to
nanda
house
it
is
plain
if
thine
eyes
could
see
these
words
of
high
endeavour
full
of
grace
and
gentle
favour
find
out
those
whose
hearts
can
feel
what
the
message
did
reveal
words
that
radha
messenger
unto
krishna
took
from
her
slowly
guiding
him
to
come
through
the
forest
to
his
home
guiding
him
to
find
the
road
which
led
though
long
to
love

the

hath
its
silver
face
marred
with
the
shame
of
lighting
earthly
loves
and

who
finds
asylum

at
great

feet
he
who
for
your
comfort
sings
all

to
the

strings
prays

prize
art
thou
not
merely
hindered
at
this
hour
wandering
lost
how
otherwise
shouldst
thou
not
hasten
to
the
but
seeing
far
away
that
maiden
come
alone
with
eyes
cast
down
and
lingering
steps
again
a
little
while
she
feared
to
hear
of
krishna
false
and
her
quick
thoughts
took
shape
in
a
fine
jealousy
with
words
like
these
something
then
of
earth
has
held
him
from
his
home
above
some
one
of
those
slight
deceivers
ah
my
foolish
love
some
new
face
some
winsome
playmate
with
her
hair
untied
and
the
blossoms
tangled
in
it
woos
him
to
her
side
on
the
dark
orbs
of
her
bosom
passionately
heaved
sink
and
rise
the
warm
white
oh
my
love
deceived
fair
yes
yes
the
rippled
shadow
of
that
midnight
hair
shows
above
her
brow
as
clouds
do
the
moon
most
fair
and
she
knows
with
wilful
paces
how
to
make
her
zone
gleam
and
please
him
and
her
tinkle
love
and
grown
coy
as
he
grows
fond
she
meets
him
with
a
modest
show
shaming
truth
with
truthful
seeming
while
her
laugh
light
low
and
her
subtle
mouth
that
murmurs
and
her
silken
cheek
and
her
eyes
say
she
dissembles
plain
as
speech
could
speak
till
at
length
a
fatal
victress
of
her
triumph
vain
on
his
neck
she
lies
and
smiles
there
ah
my
joy
my
pain
may
radha
fond
annoy
and
may
krishna
dawning
joy
warm
and
waken
love
more
fit
jayadeva
prayeth
it
and
the
griefs
and
sins
assuage
of
this
blind
and
evil
o
moon
she

that
art
so
pure
and
pale
is
krishna
wan
like
thee
with
lonely
waiting
o
lamp
of
love
art
thou
the
lover
friend
and
wilt
not
bring
him
my
long
pain
abating
o
fruitless
moon
thou
dost
increase
my
pain
o
faithless
krishna
i
have
striven
in
vain
and
then
lost
in
her
fancies
sad
she
moaned
follows
is
to
the
gurjjarî
the
ekatâlî
in
vain
in
vain
earth
will
of
earth
i
mourn
more
than
i
blame
if
he
had
known
he
would
not
sit
and
paint
the
tilka
on
her
smooth
black
brow
nor
claim
quick
kisses
from
her
yielded
lips
false
faint
false
fragrant
fatal
krishna
quest
is
by
jumna
shore
vain
it
was
vain
the
temptress
was
too
near
the
too
far
i
can
but
weep
because
he
sits
and
ties
garlands
of
for
her
loosened
hair
and
in
its
silken
shadow
veils
his
eyes
and
buries
his
fond
face
yet
i
forgave
by
jumna
wave
vainly
all
vain
make
then
the
most
of
that
whereto
given
feign
her
thy
paradise
thy
love
of
loves
say
that
her
eyes
are
stars
her
face
the
heaven
her
bosoms
the
two
worlds
with
and
the
ah
thy
dream
by
jumna
stream
it
shall
be
vain
and
vain
to
string
the
emeralds
on
her
arm
and
hang
the
milky
pearls
upon
her
neck
saying
they
are
not
jewels
but
a
swarm
of
crowded
glossy
bees
come
there
to
suck
the
rosebuds
of
her
breast
the
sweetest
flowers
of
jumna
bowers
that
shall
be
vain
nor
wilt
thou
so
believe
thine
own
blind
wooing
nor
slake
thy
heart
thirst
even
with
the
cup
which
at
the
last
she
brims
for
thee
undoing
her
girdle
of
carved
gold
and
yielding
up
love
uttermost
brief
the
poor
gain
and
pride
by
jumna
tide
because
still
vain
is
love
that
feeds
on
shadow
vain
as
thou
dost
to
look
so
deep
into
the
phantom
eyes
for
that
which
lives
not
there
and
vain
as
thou
must
to
marvel
why
the
painted
pleasure
flies
when
the
fair
false
wings
seemed
folded
for
ever
by
jumna
river
and
vain
yes
vain
for
me
too
is
it
having
so
much
striven
to
see
this
slight
snare
take
thee
and
thy
soul
which
should
have
climbed
to
mine
and
shared
my
heaven
spent
on
a
lower
loveliness
whose
whole
passion
of
claim
were
but
a
parody
of
that
kept
here
for
thee
ahaha
vain
for
on
some
isle
of
jumna
silver
stream
he
gives
all
that
they
ask
to
those
hard
eyes
while
mine
which
are
his
angel
mine
which
gleam
with
light
that
might
have
led
him
to
the
skies
that
almost
led
him
are
eclipsed
with
tears
wailing
my
fruitless
prayers
but
thou
good
friend
hang
not
thy
head
for
shame
nor
come
so
slowly
as
one
whose
message
is
too
ill
to
tell
if
thou
must
say
krishna
is
forfeit
wholly
wholly
forsworn
and
lost
let
the
grief
dwell
where
the
sin
doth
except
in
this
sad
heart

forth

thy
breasts
like
and
his
thine
eyes
like
planets
thy
fragrant
hair
thy
stately
neck
thy
queenly
sumptuous
head
thy
soft
small
feet
thy
perfect
lips
thy
teeth
like
jasmine
petals
thy
gleaming
rounded
shoulders
and
long
caressing
arms
being
thine
to
give
are
his
and
his
the
twin
strings
of
thy
girdle
and
his
the
priceless
treasure
of
thine
charms
so
follow
while
the
flowers
break
forth
in
white
and
amber
clusters
at
the
breath
of
thy
pure
presence
and
the
radiance
on
thy
brow
oh
follow
where
the
asokas
wave
their
sprays
of
gold
and
purple
as
if
to
beckon
thee
the
way
that
krishna
passed
but
now
he
is
gone
a
little
forward
though
thy
steps
are
faint
for
pleasure
let
him
hear
the
tattling
ripple
of
the
bangles
round
thy
feet
moving
slowly
the
blossoms
on
the
path
which
he
has
shown
thee
that
when
he
turns
to
listen
it
may
make
his
fond
heart
beat
and
loose
thy
jewelled
girdle
a
little
that
its
rubies
may
tinkle
softest
music
too
and
whisper
thou
art
near
though
now
if
in
the
forest
thou
bend
one
blade
of
kusha
with
silken
touch
of
passing
foot
his
heart
would
know
and
hear
would
hear
the
saying
it
is
radha
foot
that
passes
would
hear
the
wind
sigh
it
is
radha
fragrance
this
would
hear
thine
own
heart
beating
within
thy
panting
bosom
and
know
thee
coming
coming
his
ever
ever
his
hark
we
are
near
enough
for
hearing
she
will
come

like
a

among

and
shone
like

that
kept
her
gold
gown
close

still

abashed
at

shureef

the
soor
all
in

was
none
like
soorj
dehu
to
foeman
who
so
dreadful
to
friend
what
heart
so
true
like
indus
through
the
mountains
came
down
the
muslim
ranks
and
fell
before
them
as
flooded
but
soorj

rajpoot
owned
neither

was
soorj
a
rajah
because
no
crown
he
wore
save
the
grim
helm
of
iron
with
dinted
because
he
grasped
no
sceptre
save
the
sharp
tulwar
made
of
steel
that
fell
from
heaven
for
was
indra
forged
that
blade
and
many
a
starless
midnight
the
shout
of
soorj
dehu
broke
up
with
spear
and
matchlock
the
muslim
illahu
and
many
a
day
of
battle
upon
the
muslim
proud
tell
soorj
as

lightning
falls
from

buckled
on

traitor
subtle
through

soorj
was
taken
sleeping
whom
none
had
awake
then
at
the
noon
in
durbar
swore
fiercely
shureef
khan
that
soorj
should
die
in
torment
or
live
a
mussulman
but
soorj
laughed
lightly
at
him
and
answered
work
your
will
the
last
breath
of
my
body
shall
curse
your
prophet
still
with
words
of
insult
shameful
and
deeds
of
cruel
kind
they
vexed
that
rajpoot
body
but
never
moved
his
mind
and
one
is
come
who
sayeth
ho
rajpoots
soorj
is
bound
your
lord
is
caged
and
baited
by
shureef
khan

hound
the
khan
hath
caught
and
chained
him
like

all
the

spends
on
him
spite
and
rage
all

the
coward
muslims
spend
on

rage

go
up
sprang
a
hundred
horsemen
flashed
in

hand
a
sword
in

heart
burned
the
gladness
of
dying
for
their
lord
up
rose
each
rajpoot
rider
and
buckled
on
with
speed

and
and
the
saddle
of
his
steed
but
unto
none
sad
neila
gave
word
to
mount
and
ride
only
she
called
the
brothers
of
soorj
unto
her
side
and
said
take
order
straightway
to
seek
this
camp
with
me
if
love
and
craft
can
conquer

rajpoot
widows

thereat
the
ranee
neila
unbraided
from
her
hair
the
pearls
as
great
as
kashmir
grapes
soorj
gave
his
wife
to
wear
and
all
across
her
bosoms
like
to
see
she
wrapped
the
tinselled
sari
of
a
dancing
kunchenee
and
fastened
on
her
ankles
the
hundred
silver
bells
to
whose
light
laugh
of
music
the
darts
and
dwells
and
all
in
dress
a
but
all
in
heart
a
queen
she
set
her
foot
to
stirrup
with
a
sad
and
settled
mien
only
one
thing
she
carried
no
kunchenee
should
bear
the
knife
between
her
bosoms
ho
shureef
have
a
care
thereat
with
running
ditty
of

pride
and

jymul
rao
makes
the

sigh
and
the

with
tearful
eyes
note
the
music
fall
and
rise
and
the
boys
let
the
fire
fade
and
die
all
day
lay
soorj
the
rajpoot
in
shureef
iron
cage
all
day
the
coward
muslims
spent
on
him
spite
and
rage
with
bitter
cruel
torments
and
deeds
of
shameful
kind
they
racked
and
broke
his
body
but
could
not
shake
his
mind
and
only
at
the
azan
when
all
their
worst
was
vain
they
left
him
like
dogs
slinking
from
a
lion
in
his
pain
no
meat
nor
drink
they
gave
him
through
all
that
burning
day
and
done
to
death
but
scornful
at
he
lay
so
when
the
gem
of
shiva
uprose
the
shining
moon
soorj
spake
unto
his
spirit
the
end
is
coming
soon
i
would
the
end
might
hasten
could
neila
only
know
what
is
that
singing
with
voice
so
known
and
low
singing
beneath
the
the
song
of
love
and
fear
my
neila
sang
at
parting
what
doth
that
here
whence
comes
she
by
the
music
of
neila
tender
strain
she
in
that
shameless
tinsel
o
sing
again
ah
soorj
so
followed
answer
here
thine
own
neila
stands
faithful
in
life
and
death
alike
look
up
and
take
my
hands
speak
low
lest
the
guard
hear
us
if
thou
must
die
shureef
shall
have
no
triumph
but
bear
thee
company
so
sang
she
like
the
koil
that
dies
beside
its
mate
with
eye
as
black
and
fearless
and
love
as
hot
and
great
then
the
chief
laid
his
pale
lips
upon
the
little
palm
and
sank
down
with
a
smile
of
love
his
face
all
glad
and
calm
and
through
the
neila
felt
the
brave
heart
stop
fast
o
soorj
she
cried
i
follow
have
patience
to
the
last
she
turned
and
went
who

challenged
the
mussulman
a

of
the
khan
ask
if
the
high
be
pleased
to
hear
me
sing
and
shureef
full
of
feasting
the
kunchenee
bade
bring
then
all
before
the
muslims
aflame
with
lawless
wine
entered
the
ranee
neila
in
grace
and
face
divine
and
all
before
the
muslims
wagging
their
goatish
chins
the
rajpoot
princess
set
her
to

she
gave
him
was
his
first
and
last
kiss
of
dagger
driven
to
his
heart
and
past
at

he
wallowed
choked
with
wicked
blood
in
his

the
katar
quivered
where
it
stood
at

vainly

its
music
long

when

cry
a

crusade
and
to
the
of
lombardy
the
idle

rode
all
that
spring
as
all
the
spring
runs
down
into
a
lake
from
all
its
hanging
hills
the
clash
and
glitter
of
a
hundred
streams
whereof
the
rumour
reached
to
saladin
and
that
swart
king
as
royal
in
his
heart
as
any
crowned
champion
of
the
cross
that
he
might
fully
of
his
knowledge
learn
the
purpose
of
the
lords
of
christendom
and
when
their
war
and
what
their
armament
took
thought
to
cross
the

to
lombardy

with

and
trustful
amirs
twain

with

on

perilous

promised

he
was
of
a

company
upon

with
horses
hawks
and
hounds
and
tresses
fluttered
by
the

how
many
leagues
to

being
joined
to
him
that
seemed
first
of

he
told
the

they
checking
the
jangling

and
chiding
down
the
unfinished

to

shining
the

of
the

shown

by

a
little
held
the

from
its
lombard
home
with

it
chanced
he
sat
beside
the

in

the

sends
a
gift
remindful
of
her
courtesies
passed
were
the
year
and
month
and
day
and
passed
out
of
all
hearts
but
one
sir
torel
name
long
given
for
dead
by
ransomed
pavians
for
pavia
thoughtless
of
her
eastern
graves
a
lovely
widow
much
too
gay
for
grief
made
peals
from
half
a
hundred
campaniles
to
ring
a
wedding
in
the
seven
bells
of
santo
pietro
from
the
nones
to
noon
boomed
with
bronze
throats
the
happy
tidings
out
till
the
great
tenor
overswelled
with
sound
cracked
itself
dumb
thereat
the
sacristan
leading
his
swinkèd
ringers
down
the
stairs
came
blinking
into
sunlight
all
his
keys
jingling
their
little
peal
about
his
belt
whom
as
he
tarried
locking
up
the
porch
a
foreign
signor
browned
with
southern
suns
turbaned
and
slippered
as
the
muslims
use
plucked
by
the
cope
friend
quoth
he
was
a
tongue
italian
true
but
in
a
muslim
mouth
why
are
your
belfries
busy
is
it
peace
or
victory
that
so
ye

the

the

who

not
that

weds
her

widow
she
that
died
i
the
chain
the
stranger
said
ay
sir
why
not
and
you
shall
see
a
goodly
christian
feast
if
so
you
pass
their
gates
at
for
all
are
asked
no
more
the
questioner
but
folded
his
face
the
eastern
hood
lest
idle
eyes
should
mark
how
idle
words
had
struck
him
home
so
quite
forgot
so
soon
and
this
the
square
wherein
i
gave
the
joust
and
that
the
loggia
where
i
fed
the
poor
and
yon
my
palace
where
oh
fair
oh
false
they
robe
her
for
a
bridal
can
it
be
clean
out
of
heart
with
twice
six
flying
moons
the
heart
that
beat
on
mine
as
it
would
break
that
faltered
forty
oaths
forced
forced
not
false
well
i
will
sit
wife
at
thy
and
let
mine
eyes
give
my
fond
faith
the
lie
so
in
the
stream
of
gallant
guests
that
flowed
feastward
at
eve
went
torel
passed
with
them
the
outer
gates
crossed
the
great
courts
with
them
a
stranger
in
the
walls
that
called
him
lord
cressets
and
coloured
lamps
made
the
way
bright
and
strewed
to
where
within
the
doors
the
master
of
the
feast
the
bridegroom
stood
from
his
forehead
to
his
foot
speaking
fair
welcomes
he
a
courtly
lord
marking
the
eastern
guest
bespoke
him
sweet
prayed
place
for
him
and
bade
them
set
his
seat
upon
the
dais
then
the
feast
began
and
wine
went
free
as
wit
and
music
died
outdone
by
merrier
only
one
nor
ate
nor
drank
nor
spoke
nor
smiled
but
gazed
on
the
pale
bride
pale
as
her
crown
of
pearls
who
sate
so
cold
and
still
and
sad
of
cheer
at
the
but
of
a
truth
torel
read
the
thoughts
right
that
held
her
eyelids
down
and
knew
her
loyal
to
her
memories
then
to
a
little
page
who
bore
the
wine
he
spake

the

then
that

pale
ever
a

lifted
her
troubled

and
smiled

on
the

loosed
from

his

never
loosed
before
the
ring
she
gave
him
on
the
parting
day
and
ere
he
drank
behind
his
veil
of
beard
dropped
in
the
cup
the
ruby
quaffed
and
then
she
with
sad
smile
set
her

eyes
of

how
heartsure
under

guise
knowing
her

returned
she
springs
to
meet
him
coming
telling
all
in
one
great
cry
of
joy
o
me
the
rout
the
storm
of
questions
stilled
when
torel
spake
his
name
and
known
of
all
claimed
the
bride
wife
maugre
the
wasted
feast
and
woful
groom
all
hearts
but
his
were
light
to
see
torel
but
adalieta
lightest
as
she
plucked
the
away
something
therein
a
lady
dagger
small
and
bright
and
fine
clashed
out
upon
the
marble
wherefore
that
asked
torel
answered
she
i
knew
you
true
and
i
could
live
so
long
as
i
might
wait
but
they
they
pressed
me
hard
my
days
of
grace
ended
and
i
had
ended
too
faithful
to
death
if
so
thou
hadst
not
come
caliph
upon
a
day
in
ramadan
when
sunset
brought
an
end
of
fast
and
in
his
station
every
man
prepared
to
share
the
glad
repast
sate
mohtasim
in
royal
state
the
pillaw
smoked
upon
the
gold
the
fairest
slave
of
those
that
wait
mohtasim
jewelled
cup
did
hold
of
crystal
carven
was
the
cup
with
turquoise
set
along
the
brim
a
lid
of
amber
closed
it
up
was
a
great
king
that
gave
it
him
the
slave
poured
sherbet
to
the
brink
stirred
in
wild
honey
and
pomegranate
with
snow
and
cooled
the
drink
and
bore
it
where
the
caliph
sate
the
caliph
mouth
was
dry
as
bone
he
swept
his
beard
aside
to
quaff
the
beneath
the
throne
went
droning
on
with
and
the
caliph
drew
a
mighty
breath
just
then
the
reader
read
a
word
and
mohtasim
as
grim
as
death
set
down
the
cup
and
snatched
his
sword
amratan
shureefatee
speak
clear
cries
angry
mohtasim
lasr

trembling
the
newsman
read
to
him
how
in
ammoria
far
from
home
an
arab
girl
of
noble
race
was
captive
to
a
lord
of
roum
and
how
he
smote
her
on
the
face
and
how
she
cried
for
life
afraid
ya
mohtasim
help
o
my
king
and
how
the
kafir
mocked
the
maid
and
laughed
and
spake
a
bitter
thing
call
louder
fool
mohtasim
ears
are
long
as
barak
if
he
heed
your
prophet
ass
and
when
he
hears
he
come
upon
a
spotted
steed
the
caliph
face
was
stern
and
red
he
snapped
the
lid
upon
the
cup
keep
this
same
sherbet
slave
he
said
till
such
time
as
i
drink
it
up
wallah
the
stream
my
drink
shall
be
my
hollowed
palm
my
only
bowl
till
i
have
set
that
lady
free
and
seen
that
roumi
dog
head
roll
at
dawn
the
drums
of
war
were
beat
proclaiming
thus
saith
mohtasim
all
my
valiant
horsemen
meet
and
every
soldier
bring
with
him
a
spotted
steed
so
rode
they
forth
a
sight
of
marvel
and
of
fear
pied
horses
prancing
fiercely
north
the
crystal
cup
borne
in
the
rear
when
to
ammoria
he
did
win
he
smote
and
drove
the
dogs
of
roum
and
rode
his
spotted
stallion
in
crying
i
am
come
then
downward
from
her
joyful
the
arab
lady
crept
she
held
her
hair
before
her
face
she
kissed
his
feet
she
laughed
and
wept
she
pointed
where
that
lord
was
laid
they
drew
him
forth
he
whined
for
grace
then
with
fierce
eyes
mohtasim
said
she
whom
thou
smotest
on
the
face
had
scorn
because
she
called
her
king
lo
he
is
come
and
dost
thou
think
to
live
who
didst
this
bitter
thing
while
mohtasim
at
peace
did
drink
flashed
the
fierce
sword
rolled

wicked
blood
smoked
in
the

lightly
he
took
it
in
his
hand
as
down
his

were

since

have
been
made
public

such
small

these

contain
all
the

can
be
recovered

the
records
and
destinies
of
islam
than
are
these
two
sanskrit
poems
the
mahábhárata
and
rámáyana
with
that
unchanging
and
teeming
population
which
her
majesty
queen
victoria
rules
as
empress
of
hindustan
the

moralities
the
modes
of
thought
the
very
phrases
sayings
turns
of
expression
and
daily
ideas
of
the
hindu
people
are
taken
from
these
poems
their
children
and
their
wives
are
named
out
of
them
so
are
their
cities
temples
streets
and
cattle
they
have
constituted
the
library
the
newspaper
and
the
bible
generation
after
generation
to
all
the
succeeding
and
countless
millions
of
indian
people
and
it
replaces
patriotism
with
that
race
and
stands
in
stead
of
nationality
to
possess
these
two
precious
and
inexhaustible
books
and
to
drink
from
them
as
from
mighty
and
overflowing
rivers
the
value
ascribed
in
hindustan
to
these
yet
epics
has
transcended
all
literary
standards
established
in
the
west
they
are
personified
worshipped
and
cited
from
as
something
divine
to
read
or
even
listen
to
them
is
thought
by
the
devout
hindu
sufficiently
meritorious
to
bring
prosperity
to
his
household
here
and
happiness
in
the
next
world
they
are
held
also
to
give
wealth
to
the
poor
health
to
the
sick
wisdom
to
the
ignorant
and
the
recitation
of
certain
and
in
them
can
fill
the
household
of
the
barren
it
is
believed
with
children
a
concluding
passage
of
the
great
poem
says
the
reading
of
this
mahábhárata
destroys
all
sin
and
produces
virtue
so
much
so
that
the
pronunciation
of
a
single
shloka
is
sufficient
to
wipe
away
much
guilt
this
mahábhárata
contains
the
history
of
the
gods
of
the
rishis
in
heaven
and
those
on
earth
of
the
gandharvas
and
the
rákshasas
it
also
contains
the
life
and
actions
of
the
one
god
holy
immutable
and
true
who
is
krishna
who
is
the
creator
and
the
ruler
of
this
universe
who
is
seeking
the
welfare
of
his
creation
by
means
of
his
incomparable
and
indestructible
power
whose
actions
are
celebrated
by
all
sages
who
has
bound
human
beings
in
a
chain
of
which
one
end
is
life
and
the
other
death
on
whom
the
rishis
meditate
and
a
knowledge
of
whom
imparts
unalloyed
happiness
to
their
hearts
and
for
whose
gratification
and
favour
all
the
daily
devotions
are
performed
by
all
worshippers
if
a
man
reads
the
mahábhárata
and
has
faith
in
its
doctrines
he
is
free
from
all
sin
and
ascends
to
heaven
after
his
death
in
order
to
explain
the
portion
of
this
indian
epic
here
for
the
first
time
published
in
english
verse
i
reprint
a
brief
summary
of
its
plot
the
great
war
of
bhârat
has
its
first
scenes
in
hastinapur
an
ancient
and
vanished
city
formerly
situated
about
sixty
miles
of
the
modern
delhi
the
ganges
has
washed
away
even
the
ruins
of
this
the
metropolis
of
king
bhârat
dominions
the
poem
opens
with
a
sacrifice
of
snakes
but
this
is
a
prelude
connected
merely
by
a
curious
legend
with
the
real
beginning
that
beginning
is
reached
when
the
five
sons
of
king
pandu
the
pale
and
the
five
sons
of
king
dhritarashtra
the
blind
both
of
them
descendants
of
bhârat
are
being
brought
up
together
in
the
palace
the
first
were
called
pandavas
the
last
kauravas
and
their
lifelong
feud
is
the
main
subject
of
the
epic
yudhishthira
bhíma
arjuna
nakula
and
sahadeva
are
the
pandava
princes
duryodhana
is
chief
of
the
kauravas
they
are
instructed
by
one
master
drona
a
brahman
in
the
arts
of
war
and
peace
and
learn
to
manage
and
brand
cattle
hunt
wild
animals
and
tame
horses
there
is
in
the
early
portion
a
striking
picture
of
an
aryan
tournament
wherein
the
young
cousins
display
their
skill
highly
arrayed
amid
vast
crowds
and
arjuna
especially
distinguishes
himself
clad
in
golden
mail
he
shows
amazing
feats
with
sword
and
bow
he
shoots
arrows
into
the
hollow
of
a
while
his
chariot
whirls
along
he
throws
the
chakra
or
sharp
quoit
without
once
missing
his
victim
and
after
winning
the
prizes
kneels
respectfully
at
the
feet
of
his
instructor
to
receive
his
crown
the
cousins
after
this
march
out
to
fight
with
a
neighbouring
king
and
the
pandavas
who
are
always
the
favoured
family
in
the
poem
win
most
of
the
credit
so
that
yudhishthira
is
elected
from
among
them
or
heir
apparent
this
incenses
duryodhana
who
by
appealing
to
his
father
dhritarashtra
procures
a
division
of
the
kingdom
the
pandavas
being
sent
to
vacanavat
now
allahabad
all
this
part
of
the
story
refers
obviously
to
the
advances
gradually
made
by
the
aryan
conquerors
of
india
into
the
jungles
peopled
by
aborigines
forced
to
quit
their
new
city
the
pandavas
hear
of
the
marvellous
beauty
of
draupadí
whose
or
choice
of
a
suitor
is
about
to
be
celebrated
at
kâmpilya
this
again
furnishes
a
strange
and
glittering
picture
of
the
old
times
vast
masses
of
holiday
people
with
rajahs
elephants
troops
jugglers
and
showmen
are
gathered
in
a
gay
encampment
round
the
pavilion
of
the
king
draupada
whose
lovely
daughter
is
to
take
for
her
husband
on
the
condition
that
she
approves
of
him
the
fortunate
archer
who
can
strike
the
eye
of
a
golden
fish
whirling
round
upon
the
top
of
a
tall
pole
with
an
arrow
shot
from
an
enormously
strong
bow
the
princess
adorned
with
radiant
gems
holds
a
garland
of
flowers
in
her
hand
for
the
victorious
suitor
but
none
of
the
rajahs
can
bend
the
bow
arjuna
disguised
as
a
brahman
performs
the
feat
with
ease
and
his
youth
and
grace
win
the
heart
of
draupadí
more
completely
than
his
skill
the
princess
henceforth
follows
the
fortunes
of
the
brothers
and
by
a
strange
ancient
custom
lives
with
them
in
common
the
pandavas
now
allied
to
the
king
draupada
and
become
strong
are
so
much
dreaded
by
the
kauravas
that
they
are
invited
back
again
for
safety
sake
to
hastinapura
and
settle
near
it
in
the
city
of
indraprastha
now
delhi
the
reign
of
yudhishthira
and
his
brothers
is
very
prosperous
there
every
subject
was
pious
there
were
no
liars
thieves
or
cheats
no
droughts
floods
or
locusts
no
conflagrations
nor
invaders
nor
parrots
to
eat
up
the
grain
the
pandava
king
having
subdued
all
enemies
now
performs
the
or
ceremony
of
supremacy
and
here
again
occur
wonderfully
interesting
pictures
duryodhana
comes
thither
and
his
jealousy
is
inflamed
by
the
magnificence
of
the
rite
among
other
curious
incidents
is
one
which
seems
to
show
that
glass
was
already
known
a
pavilion
is
paved
with
black
crystal
which
the
kaurava
prince
mistakes
for
water
and
draws
up
his
garments
lest
he
should
be
wetted
but
now
approaches
a
in
the
epic
furious
at
the
wealth
and
fortune
of
his
cousins
duryodhana
invites
them
to
hastinapura
to
join
in
a
great
gambling
festival
the
passion
for
play
was
as
strong
apparently
with
these
antique
hindus
as
that
for
fighting
or
for
love
no
true
kshatriya
must
ever
decline
a
challenge
to
combat
or
to
dice
the
brothers
go
to
the
entertainment
which
is
to
ruin
their
prosperity
for
sakuni
the
most
skilful
and
lucky
gambler
has
loaded
the
coupun
so
as
to
win
every
throw
wheeler
excellent
summary
again
says
then
yudhishthira
and
sakuni
sat
down
to
play
and
whatever
yudhishthira
laid
as
stakes
duryodhana
laid
something
of
equal
value
but
yudhishthira
lost
every
game
he
first
lost
a
very
beautiful
pearl
next
a
thousand
bags
each
containing
a
thousand
pieces
of
gold
next
a
great
piece
of
gold
so
pure
that
it
was
as
soft
as
wax
next
a
chariot
set
with
jewels
and
hung
all
round
with
golden
bells
next
a
thousand
with
golden
howdahs
set
with
diamonds
next
a
lakh
of
slaves
all
dressed
in
rich
garments
next
a
lakh
of
beautiful
adorned
from
head
to
foot
with
golden
ornaments
next
all
the
remainder
of
his
goods
next
all
his
cattle
and
then
the
whole
of
his
râj
excepting
only
the
lands
which
had
been
granted
to
the
brahmans
after
this
tremendous
run
of
he
madly
stakes
draupadí
the
beautiful
and
loses
her
the
princess
is
dragged
away
by
the
hair
and
duryodhana
mockingly
bids
her
come
and
sit
upon
his
knee
for
which
bhíma
the
pandava
swears
that
he
will
some
day
break
his
a
vow
which
is
duly
kept
but
the
blind
old
king
rebukes
this
fierce
elation
of
the
winner
restores
draupadí
and
declares
that
they
must
throw
another
main
to
decide
who
shall
leave
hastinapura
the
cheating
sakuni
cogs
the
dice
again
and
the
pandavas
must
now
go
away
into
the
forest
and
let
no
man
know
them
by
name
for
thirteen
years
they
depart
draupadí
unbinding
her
long
black
hair
and
vowing
never
to
fasten
it
back
again
till
the
hands
of
bhíma
the
strong
man
among
the
pandavas
are
red
with
the
punishment
of
the
kauravas
then
he
shall
tie
my
tresses
up
again
when
his
fingers
are
dripping
with
duhsasana
blood
there
follow
long
episodes
of
their
adventures
in
the
jungle
till
the
time
when
the
pandavas
emerge
and
still
disguised
take
up
their
residence
in
king
viráta
city
here
the
vicissitudes
of
draupadí
as
a
handmaid
of
the
queen
of
bhíma
as
the
palace
wrestler
of
arjuna
disguised
as
a
eunuch
and
of
nakula
sahadeva
and
yudhishthira
acting
as
herdsmen
and
attendants
are
most
absorbing
and
dramatic
the
virtue
of
draupadí
assailed
by
a
prince
of
the
state
is
terribly
defended
by
the
giant
bhíma
and
when
the
kauravas
suspecting
the
presence
in
the
place
of
their
cousins
attack
viráta
arjuna
drives
the
chariot
of
the
heir
apparent
and
victoriously
repulses
them
with
his
awful
bow
gandiva
after
all
these
evidences
of
prowess
and
the
help
afforded
in
the
battle
the
king
of
viráta
discovers
the
princely
rank
of
the
pandavas
and
gives
his
daughter
in
marriage
to
the
son
of
arjuna
a
great
council
is
then
held
to
consider
the
question
of
declaring
war
on
the
kauravas
at
which
the
speeches
are
quite
homeric
the
god
krishna
taking
part
the
decision
is
to
prepare
for
war
but
to
send
an
embassy
first
meantime
duryodhana
and
arjuna
engage
in
a
singular
contest
to
obtain
the
aid
of
krishna
whom
both
of
them
seek
out
this
celestial
hero
is
asleep
when
they
arrive
and
the
proud
kaurava
as
lord
of
indraprastha
sits
down
at
his
head
arjuna
more
reverently
takes
a
place
at
his
feet
krishna
awaking
offers
to
give
his
vast
army
to
one
of
them
and
himself
as
counsellor
to
the
other
and
arjuna
gladly
allows
duryodhana
to
take
the
army
which
turns
out
much
the
worse
bargain
the
embassy
meantime
is
badly
received
but
it
is
determined
to
reply
by
a
while
warlike
preparations
continue
there
is
a
great
deal
of
useless
negotiation
against
which
draupadí
protests
like
another
constance
saying
war
war
no
peace
peace
is
to
me
a
war
krishna
consoles
her
with
the
words
weep
not
the
time
has
nearly
come
when
the
kauravas
will
be
slain
both
great
and
small
and
their
wives
will
mourn
as
you
have
been
mourning
the
ferocity
of
the
chief
of
the
kauravas
prevails
over
the
wise
counsels
of
the
blind
old
king
and
the
warnings
of
krishna
so
that
the
fatal
conflict
must
now
begin
upon
the
plain
of
kurukshetra
all
is
henceforth
martial
and
stormy
in
the
parvas
that
ensue
the
two
enormous
hosts
march
to
the
field
generalissimos
are
selected
and
defiances
of
the
most
violent
and
abusive
sort
exchanged
yet
there
are
traces
of
a
singular
civilisation
in
the
rules
which
the
leaders
draw
up
to
be
observed
in
the
war
thus
no
stratagems
are
to
be
used
the
fighting
men
are
to
fraternise
if
they
will
after
each
combat
none
may
slay
the
flier
the
unarmed
the
charioteer
or
the
beater
of
the
drum
horsemen
are
not
to
attack
footmen
and
nobody
is
to
fling
a
spear
till
the
preliminary
challenges
are
finished
nor
may
any
third
man
interfere
when
two
combatants
are
engaged
these
curious
regulations
which
would
certainly
much
embarrass
von
moltke
are
sooth
to
say
not
very
strictly
observed
and
no
doubt
were
inserted
at
a
later
age
in
the
body
of
the
poem
by
its
brahman
editors
those
same
interpolaters
have
overloaded
the
account
of
the
eighteen
days
of
terrific
battle
which
follow
with
many
episodes
and
interruptions
some
very
eloquent
and
philosophic
indeed
the
whole
comes
in
hereabouts
as
a
religious
interlude
essays
on
laws
morals
and
the
sciences
are
grafted
with
lavish
indifference
to
the
continuous
flow
of
the
narrative
upon
its
most
important
portions
but
there
is
enough
of
solid
and
tremendous
fighting
notwithstanding
to
pale
the
crimson
pages
of
the
greek
iliad
itself
the
field
glitters
indeed
with
kings
and
princes
in
panoply
of
gold
and
jewels
who
engage
in
mighty
and
varied
combats
till
the
earth
swims
in
blood
and
the
heavens
themselves
are
obscured
with
dust
and
flying
weapons
one
by
one
the
kaurava
chiefs
are
slain
and
bhíma
the
giant
at
last
meets
in
arms
duhsasana
the
kaurava
prince
who
had
dragged
draupadí
by
the
hair
he
strikes
him
down
with
the
terrible
mace
of
iron
after
which
he
cuts
off
his
head
and
drinks
of
his
blood
saying
never
have
i
tasted
a
draught
so
delicious
as
this
so
furious
now
becomes
the
war
that
even
the
just
and
mild
arjuna
commits
two
breaches
of
aryan
chivalry
killing
an
enemy
while
engaged
with
a
third
man
and
shooting
karna
dead
while
he
is
extricating
his
and
without
a
weapon
at
last
none
are
left
of
the
chief
kauravas
except
duryodhana
who
retires
from
the
field
and
hides
in
an
island
of
the
lake
the
pandavas
find
him
out
and
heap
such
reproaches
on
him
that
the
surly
warrior
comes
forth
at
length
and
agrees
to
fight
with
bhíma
the
duel
proves
of
a
tremendous
nature
and
is
decided
by
an
act
of
treachery
for
arjuna
standing
by
reminds
bhíma
by
a
gesture
of
his
oath
to
break
the
thigh
of
duryodhana
because
he
had
bidden
draupadí
sit
on
his
knee
the
giant
takes
the
hint
and
strikes
a
foul
blow
which
cripples
the
kaurava
hero
and
he
falls
helpless
to
earth
after
this
the
pandava
princes
are
declared
victorious
and
yudhishthira
is
proclaimed
king
the
great
poem
soon
softens
its
martial
music
into
a
pathetic
strain
the
dead
have
to
be
burned
and
the
living
reconciled
to
their
new
lords
while
afterwards
king
yudhishthira
is
installed
in
high
state
with
chámaras
golden
umbrellas
elephants
and
singing
he
is
enthroned
facing
towards
the
east
and
touches
rice
flowers
earth
gold
silver
and
jewels
in
token
of
owning
all
the
products
of
his
realm
being
thus
firmly
seated
on
his
throne
with
his
cousins
round
him
the
rajah
prepares
to
celebrate
the
most
magnificent
of
ancient
hindu
rites
the
or
sacrifice
of
the
horse
it
is
difficult
to
raise
the
thoughts
of
a
modern
and
western
public
to
the
solemnity
majesty
and
marvel
of
this
antique
oriental
rite
as
viewed
by
hindus
the
monarch
who
was
powerful
enough
to
perform
it
chose
a
horse
of
pure
white
colour
like
the
moon
with
a
saffron
tail
and
a
black
right
ear
or
the
animal
might
be
all
black
without
a
speck
of
colour
this
steed
wearing
a
gold
plate
on
its
forehead
with
the
royal
name
inscribed
was
turned
loose
and
during
a
whole
year
the
king
army
was
bound
to
follow
its
wanderings
whithersoever
it
went
the
ruler
of
the
invaded
territory
must
either
pay
homage
to
the
king
and
join
him
with
his
warriors
or
accept
battle
but
whether
conquered
or
peacefully
submitting
all
these
princes
must
follow
the
horse
and
at
the
end
of
the
year
assist
at
the
sacrifice
of
the
consecrated
animal
moreover
during
the
whole
year
the
king
must
restrain
all
passion
live
a
perfectly
purified
life
and
sleep
on
the
bare
ground
the
white
horse
could
not
be
loosened
until
the
night
of
the
full
moon
in
which
answers
to
the
latter
half
of
march
and
the
first
half
of
april
in
fact
at
and
it
may
be
observed
here
that
this
is
not
the
only
strange
coincidence
in
the
sacrifice
it
was
thus
an
adventure
of
romantic
conquest
mingled
with
deep
religion
and
arrogant
ostentation
and
the
entire
description
of
the
would
prove
most
interesting
the
horse
is
found
is
adorned
with
the
golden
plate
and
turned
loose
wandering
into
distant
regions
where
the
army
of
arjuna
for
it
was
he
who
led
yudhishthira
forces
goes
through
twelve
amazing
adventures
they
come
for
instance
to
a
land
of
amazons
all
of
wonderful
beauty
wearing
armour
of
pearls
and
gold
and
equally
fatal
either
to
love
or
to
fight
with
these
dazzling
enemies
however
finally
submit
as
also
the
rajah
of
the
rich
city
of
babhruváhan
which
possessed
high
walls
of
solid
silver
and
was
lighted
with
precious
jewels
for
lamps
the
serpent
people
in
the
same
way
who
live
beneath
the
earth
in
the
city
of
vasuki
yield
after
combat
to
arjuna
a
thousand
million
snakemen
dwelt
there
with
wives
of
consummate
loveliness
possessing
in
their
realm
gems
which
would
restore
dead
people
to
life
as
well
as
a
fountain
of
perpetual
youth
finally
arjuna
host
marches
back
in
great
glory
and
with
a
vast
train
of
vanquished
monarchs
to
the
city
of
hastinapura
where
all
the
subject
kings
have
audience
of
yudhishthira
and
the
immense
preparations
begin
for
the
sacrifice
of
the
horse
after
all
these
stately
celebrations
it
might
be
expected
that
the
great
poem
would
conclude
with
the
established
glories
of
the
ancient
dynasty
but
if
the
martial
part
of
the
colossal
epic
is
kshatriyan
and
the
religious
episodes
brahmanic
the
conclusion
breathes
the
spirit
of
buddhism
yudhishthira
sits
grandly
on
the
throne
but
earthly
greatness
does
not
content
the
soul
of
man
nor
can
riches
render
weary
hearts
happy
a
wonderful
scene
which
reads
like
a
rebuke
from
the
dead
addressed
to
the
living
upon
the
madness
of
all
war
occurs
in
this
part
of
the
poem
the
pandavas
and
the
old
king
dhritarashtra
being
together
by
the
banks
of
the
ganges
the
great
saint
vyása
undertakes
to
bring
back
to
them
all
the
departed
slain
in
their
fratricidal
conflict
the
spectacle
is
at
once
terrible
and
tender
but
this
revealing
of
the
invisible
world
deepens
the
discontent
of
the
princes
and
when
the
sage
vyása
tells
them
that
their
prosperity
is
near
its
end
they
determine
to
leave
their
kingdom
to
younger
princes
and
to
set
out
with
their
faces
towards
mount
meru
where
is
indra
heaven
if
haply
they
may
reach
it
there
will
be
an
end
of
this
world
joys
and
sorrows
and
union
with
the
infinite
will
be
obtained
my
translations
from
the
sanskrit
of
the
two
concluding
parvas
of
the
poem
of
which
the
above
is
a
swift
summary
describe
the
last
journey
of
the
princes
and
their
entry
into
heaven
and
herein
occurs
one
of
the
noblest
religious
apologues
not
only
of
this
great
epic
but
of
any
creed
a
beautiful
fable
of
faithful
love
which
may
be
contrasted
to
the
advantage
of
the
hindu
teaching
with
any
scriptural
representations
of
death
and
of
love
which
stronger
is
than
death
there
is
always
something
selfish
in
the
anxiety
of
orthodox
people
to
save
their
own
souls
and
our
best
religious
language
is
not
free
from
that
taint
of
pious
egotism
the
parvas
of
the
mahábhárata
which
contain
yudhishthira
approach
to
paradise
teach
on
the
contrary
that
deeper
and
better
lesson
nobly
enjoined
by
an
american
poet
the
gate
of
heaven
opens
to
none
alone
save
thou
one
soul
and
it
shall
save
thine
own
these
prefatory
remarks
seemed
necessary
to
introduce
the
subjoined
close
paraphrase
of
the
book
of
the
great
journey
and
the
book
of
the
entry
into
heaven
being
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
parvas
of
the
noble
but
as
yet
almost
unknown
mahábhárata
the
mahaprasthánika
parva
of
the
mahábhárata
the
great
journey
narayen
lord
of
lords
be
glory
given
to
sweet
saraswati
the
queen
in

to
great
vyása
eke
pay
reverence
due
so
shall
this
story
its
high
course
then
janmejaya
prayed
thou
singer
say
what
wrought
the
princes
of
the
pandavas
on
tidings
of
the
battle
so
ensued
and
krishna
gone
on
high
answered
the
sage
on
tidings
of
the
wreck
of
vrishni
race
king
yudhishthira
of
the
pandavas
was
minded
to
be
done
with
earthly
things
and
to
arjuna
spake
noble
prince
time
endeth
all
we
linger

on

till
the
last
day
tightens
the
line
and
kills
let
us
go
forth
to
die
being
yet
alive
and
kunti
son
the
great
arjuna
said
us
go
forth
to
die
time
slayeth
all
we
will
find
death
who
seeketh
other
men
and
bhimasena
hearing
answered
we
will
find
death
and
sahadev
cried
and
his
twin
brother
nakula
whereat
the
princes
set
their
faces
for
the
mount
but
yudhishthira
ere
he
left
his
realm
to
seek
high
ending
summoned
yuyutsu
surnamed
of
fights
and
set
him
over
all
regent
to
rule
in
parikshita
name
nearest
the
throne
and
parikshita
king
he
crowned
and
unto
old
subhadra
said
thy
son

wear
the
kuru

and

in
yadu
house
bring
up
the
little

here
in
our
hastinapur
but
vajra
keep
at
indraprasth
and
let
it
be
thy
last
of
virtuous
works
to
guard
the
lads
and
guide
so
ordering
ere
he
went
the
righteous
king
made
offering
of
white
water
heedfully
to
vasudev
to
rama
and
the
rest
all
funeral
rites
performing
next
he
spread
a
funeral
feast
whereat
there
sate
as

and
markandeya
rich
in
saintly
years
and
tajnavalkya

the

he
fed
with
dainty
meats
in
kingliest
wise
naming
the
name
of
him
who
bears
the
bow
and
that
it
should
be

for
him
and

and
silver
lakhs

fair
broidered
cloths
gardens
and
villages
chariots
and
steeds
and
slaves
which
being
done
o
best
of
bhârat
line
he
bowed
him
low
before
his
guru
feet
at
kripa
feet
that
sage
all
honoured
saying
my
prince
teach
parikshita
as
thou
taughtest
me
for
hearken
ministers
and
men
of
war
fixed
is
my
mind
to
quit
all
earthly
state
full
sore
of
heart
were
they
and
sore
the
folk
to
hear
such
speech
and
bitter
spread
the
word
through
town
and
country
that
the
king
would
go
and
all
the
people
cried
with
us
lord
but
yudhishthira
knew
the
time
was
come
knew
that
life
passes
and
that
virtue
lasts
and
put
aside
their
love
so
with
farewells
tenderly
took
of
lieges
and
of
lords
girt
he
for
travel
with
his
princely
kin
great
yudhishthira
dharma
royal
son
and
belt
and
ornaments
he
stripped
from
off
his
body
and
for
broidered
robe
a
rough
dress
donned
woven
of
and
what
he
did
o
lord
of
men
so
did
arjuna
bhíma
and
the
pair
nakula
with
sahadev
and
she
in
grace
the
peerless
draupadí
lastly
these
six
thou
son
of
bhârata
in
solemn
form
made
the
high
sacrifice
of
naishtiki
quenching
their
flames
in
water
at
the
close
and
so
set
forth
wailing
of
all
folk
and
tears
of
women
weeping
most
to
see
the
princess
draupadí
that
lovely
prize
of
the
great
gaming
draupadí
the
bright
journeying
afoot
but
she
and
all
the
five
rejoiced
because
their
way
lay
heavenwards
seven
were
they
setting
forth
princess
and
king
the
king
four
brothers
and
a
faithful
dog
those
left
hastinapur
but
many
a
man
and
all
the
palace
household
followed
them
the
first
sad
stage
and
ofttimes
prayed
to
part
put
parting
off
for
love
and
pity
still
sighing
little
farther
till
day
waned
then
one
by
one
they
turned
and
kripa
said
all
turn
back
yuyutsu
these
must
go
so
came
they
homewards
but
the
child
ulùpi
leapt
in
ganges
losing
them
and
chitranâgad
with
her
people
went
mournful
to
munipoor
whilst
the
three
queens
brought
parikshita
in
thus
wended
they
pandu
five
sons
and
loveliest
draupadí
tasting
no
meat
and
journeying
due
east
on
righteousness
their
high
hearts
bent
to
heaven
their
souls
assigned
and
steadfast
trode
their
feet
by
faith
upborne
past
nullah
ran
and
wood
river
and
jheel
and
plain
king
yudhishthir
walked
foremost
bhíma
followed
after
him
arjuna
and
the
brethren
next
nakula
with
sahadev
in
whose
still
steps
o
best
of
bhârat
offspring
draupadí
that
gem
of
women
paced
with
soft
dark
face
beautiful
wonderful
and
lustrous
eyes
like
last
the
dog
following
the
pandavas
at
length
they
reach
the
far
lauchityan
sea
which
foameth
white
under
udayachâla
know
ye
that
all
this
while
nakula
had
not
ceased
bearing
the
holy
bow
named
gandiva
and
jewelled
quiver
ever
filled
with
shafts
though
one
should
shoot
a
thousand
thousand
times
here
broad
across
their
path
the
heroes
see
agni
the
god
as
though
a
mighty
hill
took
form
of
front
and
breast
and
limb
he
spake
seven
streams
of
shining
splendour
rayed
his
brow
while
the
dread
voice
said
am
agni
chiefs
o
sons
of
pandu
i
am
agni
hail
o
yudhishthira
blameless
king
o
warlike
bhíma
o
arjuna
wise
o
brothers
from
a
womb
divine
hear
i
am
agni
who
consumed
the
wood
by
will
of
narayan
for
arjuna
sake
let
this
your
brother
give
gandiva
back
the
matchless
bow
the
use
for
it
is
that
which
he
whirled
cometh
again
to
krishna
in
his
hand
for
avatars
to
be
and
need
is
none
henceforth
of
this
most
excellent
bright
bow
gandiva
which
i
brought
for
partha
aid
from
high
varuna
let
it
be
returned
cast
it
herein
and
all
the
princes
said
it
dear
brother
so
arjuna
threw
into
that
sea
the
quiver
and
glittering
bow
then
led
by
agni
light
unto
the
south
they
turned
and
so
and
afterwards
right
west
until
they
saw
dwaraka
washed
and
bounded
by
a
main
on
its
shores
and
here
o
best
vanished
the
god
while
yet
those
heroes
walked
now
to
the
bending
where
long
coasts
shut
in
the
sea
of
salt
now
to
the
north
accomplishing
all
quarters
journeyed
they
the
earth
their
altar
of
high
sacrifice
which
these
most
patient
feet
did
pace
around
till
meru
rose
at
last
it
rose
these
six
their
senses
subjugate
their
spirits
pure
wending
alone
came
into
sight
far
off
in
the
eastern
sky
of
awful
himavan
and
midway
in
the
peaks
of
himavan
meru
the
mountain
of
all
mountains
rose
whose
head
is
heaven
and
under
himavan
glared
a
wide
waste
of
sand
dreadful
as
death
then
as
they
hastened
the
deadly
waste
aiming
for
meru
having
thoughts
at
soul
infinite
eager
lo
draupadí
reeled
with
faltering
heart
and
feet
and
bhíma
turned
gazing
upon
her
and
that
hero
spake
to
yudhishthira
brother
king
why
doth
she
fail
for
never
all
her
life
wrought
our
sweet
lady
one
thing
wrong
i
think
thou
knowest
make
us
know
why
hath
she
failed
then
yudhishthira
answered
one
thing
she
loved
our
brother
better
than
all
else
better
than
heaven
that
was
her
tender
sin
fault
of
a
faultless
soul
she
pays
for
spake
the
monarch
turning
not
his
eyes
though
draupadí
lay
dead
striding
straight
on
for
meru
of
the
things
of
heaven
perfect
and
firm
but
yet
a
little
space
and
sahadev
fell
down
which
bhíma
seeing
cried
once
again
king
great
madri
son
stumbles
and
sinks
why
hath
he
sunk
so
true
so
brave
and
steadfast
and
so
free
from
pride
was
not
free
with
countenance
still
fixed
quoth
yudhishthira
was
true
and
fast
and
wise
yet
wisdom
made
him
proud
he
hid
one
little
hurt
of
soul
but
now
it
kills
so
saying
he
strode
on
kunti
strong
son
and
bhíma
and
arjuna
followed
him
and
nakula
and
the
hound
leaving
behind
sahadev
in
the
sands
but
nakula
weakened
and
grieved
to
see
sahadev
fall
his
loved
lagged
and
stayed
and
next
prone
on
his
face
he
fell
that
noble
face
which
had
no
match
for
beauty
in
the
land
glorious
and
godlike
nakula
then
sighed
bhíma
anew
and
lord
the
man
who
never
erred
from
virtue
never
broke
our
fellowship
and
never
in
the
world
was
matched
for
goodly
perfectness
of
form
or
gracious
feature
nakula
has
fallen
but
yudhishthira
holding
fixed
his
eyes
that
changeless
faithful
king
replied
but
he
erred
the
godlike
form
he
wore
beguiled
him
to
believe
none
like
to
him
and
he
alone
desirable
and
things
unlovely
to
be
slighted
slays
our
noble
brother
bhíma
follow
each
pays
what
his
debt
was
which
arjuna
heard
weeping
to
see
them
fall
and
that
stout
son
of
pandu
that
destroyer
of
his
foes
that
prince
who
drove
through
crimson
waves
of
war
in
old
days
with
his
of
milk
he
the
sank
beholding
this
the
yielding
of
that
soul
unconquerable
fearless
divine
from
sákra
self
derived
arjuna
bhíma
cried
aloud
king
this
man
was
surely
perfect
never
once
not
even
in
slumber
when
the
lips
are
loosed
spake
he
one
word
that
was
not
true
as
truth
ah
heart
of
gold
why
art
thou
broke
o
king
whence
falleth
he
and
yudhishthira
said
not
pausing
he
lied
a
lordly
lie
he
bragged
our
brother
that
a
single
day
should
see
him
utterly
consume
alone
all
those
his
enemies
which
could
not
be
yet
from
a
great
heart
sprang
the
unmeasured
speech
howbeit
a
finished
hero
should
not
shame
himself
in
such
wise
nor
his
enemy
if
he
will
faultless
fight
and
blameless
die
this
was
arjuna
sin
follow
thou
me
so
the
king
still
went
on
but
bhíma
next
fainted
and
stayed
upon
the
way
and
sank
yet
sinking
cried
behind
the
steadfast
prince
brother
see
i
die
look
upon
me
thy
wherefore
falter
i
who
strove
to
stand
and
yudhishthira
said
than
was
well
the
goodly
things
of
earth
pleased
thee
my
pleasant
brother
light
the
offence
and
large
thy
virtue
but
the
flesh
plumed
itself
over
spirit
pritha
son
for
this
thou
failest
who
so
near
didst
gain
thenceforth
alone
the
monarch
strode
not
looking
back
nay
not
for
bhíma
sake
but
walking
with
his
face
set
for
the
mount
and
the
hound
followed
him
only
the
hound
after
the
deathly
sands
the
mount
and
lo
sákra
shone
forth
the
god
filling
the
earth
and
heavens
with
thunder
of
his
he
said
me
pritha
great
son
but
yudhishthira
answered
sore
at
heart
for
those
his
kinsfolk
fallen
on
the
way
o
lord
of
all
the
gods
give
that
my
brothers
come
with
me
who
fell
not
without
them
is
swarga
sweet
to
me
she
too
the
dear
and
kind
and
queenly
she
whose
perfect
virtue
paradise
must
crown
grant
her
to
come
with
us
dost
thou
grant
this
the
god
replied
heaven
thou
shalt
see
thy
kinsmen
and
the
queen
these
will
attain
with
krishna
grieve
no
longer
for
thy
dead
thou
chief
of
men
their
mortal
covering
stripped
they
have
their
places
but
to
thee
the
gods
allot
an

but
the
king
answered
thou
wisest
one
who
what
was
and
is
and
is
to
be
still
one
more
grace
this
hound
hath
ate
with
me
followed
me

must
i
leave
him
now

now
as
we
deathless
divine
thou
art
become
a
god

and
power
and
gifts
celestial
and
all
the
joys
of
heaven
are
thine
for
aye
what
hath
a
beast
with
these
leave
here
thy
hound
yet
yudhishthira
answered
most
high
o
and
wisest
can
it
be
that
one
exalted
should
seem
pitiless
nay
let
me
lose
such
glory
for
its
sake
i
would
not
leave
one
living
thing
i
loved
then
sternly
indra
spake
is
unclean
and
into
swarga
such
shall
enter
not
the
krodhavasha
hand
destroys
the
fruits
of
sacrifice
if
dogs
defile
the
fire
bethink
thee
dharmaraj
quit
now
this
beast
that
which
is
seemly
is
not
hard
of
heart
still
he
replied
tis
written
that
to
spurn
a
suppliant
equals
in
offence
to
slay
a
wherefore
not
for
swarga
bliss
quit
i
mahendra
this
poor
clinging
dog
so
without
any
hope
or
friend
save
me
so
wistful
fawning
for
my
faithfulness
so
agonized
to
die
unless
i
help
who
among
men
was
called
steadfast
and
just
quoth
indra
the
is
foul
where
a
dog
passeth
angry
angels
sweep
the
ascending
smoke
aside
and
all
the
fruits
of
offering
and
the
merit
of
the
prayer
of
him
whom
a
hound
toucheth
leave
it
here
he
that
will
enter
heaven
must
enter
pure
why
didst
thou
quit
thy
brethren
on
the
way
quit
krishna
quit
the
draupadí
attaining
firm
and
glorious
to
this
mount
through
perfect
deeds
to
linger
for
a
brute
hath
yudhishthira
vanquished
self
to
melt
with
one
poor
passion
at
the
door
of
bliss
thou
for
this
who
didst
not
stay
for
them
draupadí
bhíma
but
the
king
yet
spake
tis
known
that
none
can
hurt
or
help
the
dead
they
the
delightful
ones
who
sank
and
died
following
my
footsteps
could
not
live
again
though
i
had
turned
therefore
i
did
not
turn
but
could
help
profit
i
had
turned
to
help
there
be
four
sins
o
sákra
grievous
sins
the
first
is
making
suppliants
despair
the
second
is
to
slay
a
nursing
wife
the
third
is
spoiling
brahmans
goods
by
force
the
fourth
is
injuring
an
ancient
friend
these
four
i
deem
not
direr
than
the
sin
if
one
in
coming
forth
from
woe
to
weal
abandon
any
meanest
comrade
then
straight
as
he
spake
brightly
great
indra
smiled
vanished
the
hound
and
in
its
stead
stood
there
the
lord
of
death
and
justice
dharma
self
sweet
were
the
words
which
fell
from
those
dread
lips
precious
the
lovely
praise
thou
true
king
thou
that
dost
bring
to
harvest
the
good
seed
of
pandu
righteousness
thou
that
hast
ruth
as
he
before
on
all
which
lives
o
son
i
tried
thee
in
the
dwaita
wood
what
time
the
yaksha
smote
them
bringing
water
then
thou
prayedst
for
nakula
life
tender
and
just
not
bhíma
nor
arjuna
true
to
both
to
madrî
as
to
kuntî
to
both
queens
hear
thou
my
word
because
thou
didst
not
mount
this
car
divine
lest
the
poor
hound
be
shent
who
looked
to
thee
lo
there
is
none
in

shall
sit
above
thee
king

filled
the

and
fell
on

cast
by
his

sons
being
to

ascended
if
thou
and
thou
all
whom

me
how
fared
it
with
those
mighty
souls
answered
the
sage
hear
of
thy
forefathers
great
yudhishthira
and
the
pandu
lords
how
it
befell
when
thus
the
blameless
king
was
entered
into
heaven
there
he
beheld
duryodhana
his
foe
throned
as
a
god
amid
the
gods
splendidly
sate
that
prince
peaceful
and
proud
the
radiance
of
his
brows
like
the
sun
and
round
him
thronged
spirits
of
light
with
sádhyas
companies
goodly
to
see
but
when
the
king
beheld
duryodhana
in
bliss
and
not
his
own
not
draupadí
nor
bhíma
nor
the
rest
with
face
and
angry
eyes
the
monarch
spake

for
such
as
these
if
these
come
here
i
do
not
wish
to
dwell
where
he
is
whom
i
hated
rightfully
being
a
covetous
and
witless
prince
whose
deed
it
was
that
in
wild
fields
of
war
brothers
and
friends
by
mutual
slaughter
fell
while
our
swords
smote
sharpened
so
wrathfully
by
all
those
wrongs
borne
wandering
in
the
woods
but
draupadí
the
deepest
wrong
for
he
he
who
sits
there

with

upon
him
sith
is
so
where
are
my
brothers
thither
will
i
go
smiling
bright
narada
the
sage
replied
thou
not
rashly
say
not
this
o
king
those
who
come
here
lay
enmities
aside
o
yudhishthira
monarch
hear
duryodhana
is
cleansed
of
sin
he
sits
worshipful
as
the
saints
worshipped
by
saints
and
kings
who
lived
and
died
in
virtue
path
attaining
to
the
joys
which
heroes
gain
who
yield
their
breath
in
battle
even
so
he
that
did
wrong
thee
knowing
not
thy
worth
hath
won
before
thee
hither
raised
to
bliss
for
lordliness
and
valour
free
of
fear
ah
prince
ponder
thou
not
the
memory
of
that
gaming
nor
the
griefs
of
draupadí
nor
any
vanished
hurt
wrought
in
the
passing

thy
happy
foeman
wiser
now
for
here

paradise
thou
chief
of
men
and
in
its
holy
air
hatreds
are
dead
thus
by
such
lips
addressed
the
pandu
king
answered
uncomforted
if
he
attains
attains
yet
not
the
less
evil
he
lived
and
ill
he
died
a
heart
impious
and
harmful
bringing
woes
to
all
to
friends
and
foes
his
was
the
crime
which
cost
our
land
its
warriors
horses
elephants
his
the
black
sin
that
set
us
in
the
field
burning
for
rightful
vengeance
ye
are
gods
and
just
and
ye
have
granted
heaven
to
him
show
me
the
regions
therefore
where
they
dwell
my
brothers
those
the
the
loyal
who
kept
the
sacred
laws
who
swerved
no
step
from
virtue
path
who
spake
the
truth
and
lived
foremost
of
warriors
where
is
kunti
son
the
karna
where
are
gone
sátyaki
dhrishtadyumna
with
their
sons
and
where
those
famous
chiefs
who
fought
for
me
dying
a
splendid
death
i
see
them
not
o
narada
i
see
them
not
no

draupada
no

no
glad

no
shikandina
prince
of
panchála
nor

dear
where
are
those
noble
maharashtra
lords
rajahs
and
rajpoots
slain
for
love
of
me
dwell
they
in
glory
elsewhere
not
yet
seen
if
they
be
here
high
gods
and
those
with
them
for
whose
sweet
sakes
i
lived
here
will
i
live
but
if
such
be
not
adjudged
worthy
i
am
not
worthy
nor
my
soul
willing
to
rest
without
them
ah
i
burn
now
in
glad
heaven
with
grief
bethinking
me
of
those
my
mother
words
what
time
i
poured
for
my
dead
at
kurkshetra
pour
for
prince
karna
son
but
i
wist
not
his
feet
were
as
my
mother
feet
his
blood
her
blood
my
blood
o
gods
i
did
not
know
albeit
sákra
self
had
failed
to
break
our
battle
where
stood
i
crave
to
see
surya
child
that
glorious
chief
who
fell
by
saryasáchi
hand
unknown
of
me
and
bhíma
ah
my
bhíma
dearer
far
than
life
to
me
arjuna
like
a
god
nakla
and
sahadev
twin
lords
of
war
with
tenderest
draupadí
show
me
those
souls
i
can
not
tarry
where
i
have
them
not
bliss
is
not
blissful
just
and
mighty
ones
save
if
i
rest
beside
them
heaven
is
there
where
love
and
faith
make
heaven
let
me
go
and
answer
made
the
hearkening
heavenly
ones
if
it
seemeth
good
to
thee
dear
son
the
king
of
gods
commands
we
do
thy
will
so
saying
the
bard
went
on
dharma
own
voice
gave
ordinance
and
from
the
shining
bands
a
golden
deva
glided
taking
hest
to
guide
the
king
there
where
his
kinsmen
were
so
wended
these
the
holy
angel
first
and
in
his
steps
the
king
close
following
together
passed
they
through
the
gates
of
pearl
together
heard
them
close
then
to
the
left
descending
by
a
path
evil
and
dark
hard
to
be
traversed
rugged
entered
they
the
road
the
tread
of
sinful
feet
matted
the
thick
thorns
carpeting
its
slope
the
smell
of
sin
hung
foul
on
them
the
mire
about
their
roots
was
trampled
filth
of
flesh
horrid
with
rottenness
and
splashed
with
gore
curdling
in
crimson
puddles
where
there
buzzed
and
sucked
and
settled
creatures
of
the
swamp
hideous
in
wing
and
sting
and
flies
with
moths
toads
newts
and
snakes
and
livid
loathsome
worms
writhing
in
slime
forth
from
and
scalps
and
tumbled
bones
a
burning
forest
shut
the
roadside
in
on
either
hand
and
its
crackling
boughs
perched
ghastly
birds
or
flapped
amongst
the
flames
vultures
and
kites
and
crows
with
brazen
plumes
and
beaks
of
iron
and
these
grisly
fowl
screamed
to
the
shrieks
of
prets
lean
famished
ghosts
featureless
eyeless
having
mouths
hungering
but
hard
to
fill
all
swooping
down
to
gorge
upon
the
meat
of
wicked
ones
whereof
the
limbs
disparted
trunks
and
heads
offal
and
marrow
littered
all
the
way
by
such
a
path
the
king
passed
sore
afeared
if
he
had
known
of
fear
for
the
air
stank
with
carrion
stench
sickly
to
breathe
and
lo
presently
the
pathway
foamed
a
flood
of
boiling
waves
rolling
down
corpses
this
they
crossed
and
then
the
asipatra
wood
spread
black
in
sight
whereof
the
undergrowth
was
spitting
every
blade
some
wretch
all
around
poison
trees
and
next
to
this
strewn
deep
with
fiery
sands
an
awful
waste
wherethrough
the
wicked
toiled
with
blistering
feet
rocks
of
brass
red
hot
which
scorched
and
pools
of
bubbling
pitch
that
gulfed
them
last
the
gorge
of
kutashála
mali
frightful
gate
of
utmost
hell
with
utmost
horrors
filled
deadly
and
nameless
were
the
plagues
seen
there
which
when
the
monarch
reached
nigh
overborne
by
terrors
and
the
reek
of
tortured
flesh
unto
the
angel
spake
he
goes
this
hateful
road
and
where
be
they
i
seek
yet
find
not
answer
made
the
heavenly
one
great
king
it
was
commanded
me
to
bring
thy
steps
if
thou
overborne
it
is
commanded
that
i
lead
thee
back
to
where
the
gods
wait
wilt
thou
turn
and
mount
then
o
thou
son
of
bhárat
yudhishthir
turned
heavenward
his
face
so
was
he
moved
with
horror
and
the
hanging
stench
and
spent
by
toil
of
that
black
travel
but
his
feet
scarce
one
stride
measured
when
about
the
place
pitiful
accents
rang
sweet
king
ah
saintly
lord
ah
thou
that
hast
attained
place
with
the
blessed
pandu
offspring
pause
a
little
while
for
love
of
us
who
cry
nought
can
harm
in
all
this
baneful
place
but
at
thy
coming
there
blow
a
breeze
balmy
and
soothing
bringing
us
relief
o
pritha
son
mightiest
of
men
we
breathe
glad
breath
again
to
see
thee
we
have
peace
one
moment
in
our
agonies
stay
here
one
moment
more
bhárata
child
go
not
thou
victor
of
the
kurus
being
here
hell
softens
and
our
bitter
pains
relax
these
pleadings
wailing
all
around
the
place
heard
the
king
yudhishthira
words
of
woe
humble
and
eager
and
compassion
seized
his
lordly
mind
souls
unknown
he
sighed
and
hellwards
turned
anew
for
what
those
were
whence
such
beseeching
voices
and
of
whom
that
son
of
pandu
wist
not
only
wist
that
all
the
noxious
murk
was
filled
with
forms
shadowy
in
anguish
crying
grace
of
him
wherefore
he
called
aloud
speaks
with
me
what
do
ye
here
and
what
things
suffer
ye
then
from
the
black
depth
piteously
there
came
answers
of
whispered
suffering
i
o
king
and
yet
another
my
liege
thy
bhíma
speaks
and
then
a
voice
again
am
arjuna
brother
and
again
is
here
and
sahadev
and
last
a
moan
of
music
from
the
darkness
sighed
cries
to
thee
thereat
broke
forth
the
monarch
spirit
knowing
so
the
sound
of
each
familiar
voice
doom
is
this
what
have
my
wrought
to
earn
death
with
the
damned
or
life
loathlier
than
death
in
narak
midst
hath
karna
erred
so
deep
bhíma
arjuna
or
the
glorious
twins
or
she
the
sweetest
best
my
princess
that
duryodhana
should
sit
peaceful
in
paradise
with
all
his
crew
throned

the

waxed
wroth
that

burned
terrible
with
tenderness
the
while
his

searched
all

in

then
he
cursed
the

that
steadfast

broke
from
its
faith
in
virtue
but
he
stayed
th
indignant
passion
softly
speaking
this
unto
the

nought
replied

straight
repaired
unto
the

sate

rose
they
and
together
stepped
down
from

treading
the

tarried
sákra
led
the

van
and
dharma

paced

next
o

of

while
that

came
down
pure
as
the

sweeping
through

and
brighter
than

melted
before

warm

rolled
over
the

calmed
the

of
torment
in

the

river
shrank
quiet
and
clear
the
asipatra

awful
wood
blossomed
with
colours
all
those
cruel
blades
and
dreadful
rocks
and
piteous
scattered
wreck
of
writhing
bodies
where
the
king
had
passed
vanished
as
dreams
fade
cool
and
fragrant
went
a
wind
before
their
faces
as
these

drew
radiant
to
the
presence
of
the

maruts
and
vasus
eight
who
shine

those
were
there
with
angels
saints
and
habitants
of

smiling
resplendent
round

then
spake
the
god
of

these
gracious
words
to
yudhishthira
standing
in
that
place
yudhishthira
o
thou
lord
this
is
enough
all

is
glad
of
thee
it
is
enough
come
thou
most
blessed
one
unto
thy
peace
lay
now
aside
thy
loving
wrath
and
hear
the
speech
of
heaven
it
is
appointed
that
all
kings
see
hell
the
reckonings
for
the
life
of
men
are
twain
of

righteous
deeds
a

a

true
of

evil
deeds
who
hath
wrought
little
right
to
him
is
paid
a
little
bliss
in
swarga
then
the
woe
which
purges
who
much
right
hath
wrought
from
him
the
little
ill
by
lighter
pains
is
cleansed
and
then
the
joys
sweet
is
peace
after
pain
and
bitter
pain
which
follows
peace
yet
they
who
sorely
sin
taste
of
the
heaven
they
miss
and
they
that
suffer
quit
their
debt
at

when
as

i
followed
thee
and
found
thy

constant
to
the

here
was
the

it
with

as
this

ends
it
is

that

therefore
thou
hast
borne
the
passing

briefest
for
thee

in
this

it
is
great
gunga
flowing
through

thus
the
rejoicing
king
thy

proceeded
straight
unto
that
river

which
floweth
pure
through
the
three
worlds
mighty
and

there
being
bathed
the

with

by
softest

where
those
heroes
stood
the
princes
of

pandavas

waiting
to

so
shall
this
story
worthily
those
vanquished
warriors
then
sanjaya
said
fled
southwards
and
near
sunset
past
the
tents
unyoked
abiding
close
in
fear
and
rage
there
was
a
wood
beyond
the
camp
untrod
quiet
and
in
its
leafy
harbour
lay
the
princes
some
among
them
bleeding
still
from
spear
and
all
fetching
faint
breath
and
fighting
again
in
thought
that
battle
but
there
came
the
noise
of
pandavas
pursuing
fierce
and
loud
outcries
of
victory
whereat
those
chiefs
sullenly
rose
and
yoked
their
steeds
again
driving
due
east
and
eastward
still
they
drave
under
the
night
till
drouth
and
desperate
toil
stayed
horse
and
man
then
took
they
lair
again
the
panting
horses
and
the
warriors
wroth
with
chilled
wounds
and
the
of
their
king
now
were
they
come
my
prince
sanjaya
said
unto
a
jungle
thick
with
stems
whereon
the
tangled
creepers
coiled
here
entered
they
watering
their
horses
at
a
stream
and
pushed
deep
in
the
thicket
many
a
beast
and
bird
sprang
startled
at
their
feet
the
long
grass
stirred
with
serpents
creeping
off
the
woodland
flowers
shook
where
the
hid
and
where
frogs
plunged
the
swamp
rocked
all
its
reeds
and
a
with
countless
dropping
boughs
spied
they
and
beneath
its
aisles
a
pool
hereby
they
stayed
tethering
their
steeds
and
dipping
water
made
the
evening
prayer
but
when
the
sank
in
the
west
and
night
descended
gentle
soothing
night
who
comforts
all
with
silver
splendour
decked
of
stars
and
constellations
and
soft
folds
of
velvet
darkness
drawn
then
those
wild
things
which
roam
in
darkness
woke
wandering
afoot
under
the
gloom
horrid
the
forest
grew
with
roar
and
yelp
and
yell
around
that
place
where
kripa
kritavarman
and
the
son
of
drona
lay
beneath
the
full
many
a
piteous
passage
instancing
in
their
lost
of
dreadful
blood
till
sleep
fell
heavy
on
the
wearied
lids
of
bhoja
child
and
kripa
then
these
lords
to
princely
life
and
silken
couches
used
sought
on
the
bare
earth
slumber
spent
and
sad
as
houseless
outcasts
lodge
but
oh
my
king
there
came
no
sleep
to
drona
angry
son
great
aswatthâman
as
a
snake
lies
coiled
and
hisses
breathing
so
his
panting
breath
hissed
rage
and
hatred
round
him
while
he
lay
chin
uppermost
with
fierce
eyes
roving
the
wood
and
seeing
sightlessly
thus
chanced
it
that
his
wandering
glances
turned
into
the
shadows
where
there
perched
a
thousand
crows
on
its
limbs
some
nested
some
on
branchlets
deep
asleep
heads
under
wings
all
fearless
nor
o
prince
had
aswatthâman
more
than
marked
the
birds
when
lo
there
fell
out
of
the
velvet
night
silent
and
terrible
an
with
wide
soft
deadly
dusky
wings
and
eyes
and
long
claws
and
dreadful
beak
like
a
winged
sprite
or
great
garood
himself
offspring
of
bhârata
it
lighted
there
upon
the
banian
bough
hooted
but
low
the
fury
smothering
in
its
throat
then
fell
with
murderous
beak
and
claws
upon
those
crows
rending
the
wings
from
this
the
legs
from
that
from
some
the
heads
of
some
ripping
the
crops
till
tens
and
scores
the
fowl
rained
down
to
earth
bloody
and
plucked
and
all
the
ground
waxed
black
with
piled
whilst
the
great
owl
hooted
for
joy
of
vengeance
and
again
spread
the
wide
deadly
dusky
wings
up
sprang
the
son
of
drona
this
owl
quoth
he
me
wisdom
lo
one
slayeth
so
insolent
foes
asleep
the
pandu
lords
are
all
too
strong
in
arms
by
day
to
kill
they
triumph
being
many
yet
i
swore
before
the
king
my
father
i
would
kill
and
kill
even
as
a
foolish
fly
should
swear
to
quench
a
flame
it
scorched
and
i
shall
die
if
i
dare
open
battle
but
by
art
men
vanquish
fortune
and
the
mightiest
odds
if
there
be
two
ways
to
a
wise
man
wish
yet
only
one
way
sure
he
taketh
this
and
if
it
be
an
evil
way
condemned
for
brahmans
yet
the
kshattriya
may
do
what
vengeance
bids
against
his
foes
our
foes
the
pandavas
are
furious
treacherous
base
halting
at
nothing
and
how
say
the
wise
in
holy
shastras
wounded
wearied
fed
or
fasting
sleeping
waking
setting
forth
or
new
arriving
slay
thine
enemies
and
so
again
at
midnight
when
they
sleep
dawn
when
they
watch
not
noon
if
leaders
fall
eve
should
they
scatter
all
the
times
and
hours
are
times
and
hours
fitted
for
killing
foes
so
did
the
son
of
drona
steel
his
soul
to
break
upon
the
sleeping
pandu
chiefs
and
slay
them
in
the
darkness
being
set
on
this
unlordly
deed
and
clear
in
scheme
he
from
their
slumbers
roused
the
warriors

and
kritavarman

most
when

for

prayer
is
surely
borne
on

prayer
is

than

alway
how
sweet
are

and

he
surnamed
lion
of

in
many
battles
famed
the
cousin
of
our
lord
the
prophet
grace
be
his
uprose
betimes
one
morn
to
pace
as
he
was
wont
unto
the
mosque
wherein
our
lord
bliss
live
with
him
watched
to
begin
darkling
was
the
sky
and
strait
the
lane
between
the
city
and
by
rough
stones
broken
and
deep
pools
of
rain
and
there
through
toilfully
with
steps
of
pain
leaning
upon
his
staff
an
old
jew
went
to
synagogue
on
pious
errand
bent
for
those
be
people
of
the
book
and
some
are
chosen
of
allah
will
who
have
not
come
unto
full
light
of
wisdom
therefore
he
àli
the
caliph
of
proud
days
to
be
knowing
this
good
old
man
and
why
he
stirred
thus
early
the
morning
mills
were
heard
out
of
his
nobleness
and
grace
of
soul
would
not
thrust
past
though
the
jew
blocked
the
whole
breadth
of
the
lane
so
they
went
that
ancient
first
and
in
soft
discontent
after
him
àli
noting
how
the
sun
flared
nigh
and
fearing
prayer
might
be
begun
yet
no
command
upraising
no
harsh
cry
to
stand
aside
because
the
dignity
of
silver
hairs
is
much
and
morning
praise
was
precious
to
the
jew
too
thus
their
ways
wended
the
pair
great
àli
sad
and
slow
following
the
greybeard
while
the
east
blazed
with
bright
spears
of
gold
athwart
the
blue
and
the
muezzin
call
came
in
the
mosque
our
lord
on
whom
be
peace
stood
by
the
in
act
to
bow
and
forth
to
say
but
as
his
lips
moved
some
strong
hand
did
lay
over
his
mouth
a
palm
invisible
so
that
no
voice
on
the
assembly
fell
rabbi
thrice
he
tried
to
read
and
thrice
the
sound
of
reading
died
stayed
by
this
unseen
touch
thereat
amazed
our
lord
muhammed
turned
arose
and
gazed
and
saw
alone
of
those
within
the
shrine
a
splendid
presence
with
large
eyes
divine
beaming
and
golden
pinions
folded
down
their
speed
still
tokened
by
the
fluttered
gown
gabriel
he
knew
the
spirit
who
doth
stand
chief
of
the
sons
of
at
god
right
hand
gabriel
why
stayest
thou
me
the
prophet
said
since
at
this
hour
the
should
be
read
but
the
bright
presence
smiling
pointed
where
àli
towards
the
outer
gate
drew
near
upon
the
threshold
shaking
off
his
shoes
and
giving
alms
of
entry
as
men
use
yea
spake
th
archangel
sacred
is
the
sound
of
and
worth
the
world
wide
round
though
earth
were
pearl
and
silver
therefore
i
stayed
thee
muhammed
in
the
act
to
cry
lest
àli
tarrying
in
the
lane
should
miss
for
his
good
deed
its
blessing
and
its
bliss
thereat
th
archangel
vanished

dear
wife
to
whom
beside
so
well
true
counsellor
and
tried
at
every
shift
i
bring
my
book
of
counsels
let
it
tell
largeness
of
love
by
littleness
of

take
this
growth
of
foreign
skies
from
me
a
scholar
thanks
for
gentle
help

though

bears
a
bright

if

in
this
soil
preface
the
book
of
good
counsels
the
is
a
work
of
high
antiquity
and
extended
popularity
the
prose
is
doubtless
as
old
as
our
own
era
but
the
intercalated
verses
and
proverbs
compose
a
selection
from
writings
of
an
age
extremely
remote
the
and
the
textual
are
of
those
quoted
to
the
first
of
which
professor
williams
in
his
admirable
edition
of
the
assigns
the
modest
date
of
while
he
claims
for
the
an
antiquity
as
high
as
the
may
thus
be
fairly
styled
the
father
of
all
fables
for
from
its
numerous
translations
have
probably
come
esop
and
pilpay
and
in
latter
days
originally
compiled
in
sanskrit
it
was
rendered
by
order
of
nushirván
in
the
sixth
century
into
persic
from
the
persic
it
passed
into
the
arabic
and
thence
into
hebrew
and
greek
in
its
own
land
it
obtained
as
wide
a
circulation
the
emperor
akbar
impressed
with
the
wisdom
of
its
maxims
and
the
ingenuity
of
its
apologues
commended
the
work
of
translating
it
to
his
own
vizier
abdul
fazel
that
minister
accordingly
put
the
book
into
a
familiar
style
and
published
it
with
explanations
under
the
title
of
the
of
the
emperor
had
also
suggested
the
abridgment
of
the
long
series
of
shlokes
which
here
and
there
interrupt
the
narrative
and
the
vizier
found
this
advice
sound
and
followed
it
like
the
present
translator
to
this
day
in
india
the
under
its
own
or
other
names
as
the
retains
the
delighted
attention
of
young
and
old
and
has
some
representative
in
all
the
indian
vernaculars
a
selection
from
the
metrical
sanskrit
proverbs
and
maxims
is
here
given
from
the
of
the
book
of

true
bliss
