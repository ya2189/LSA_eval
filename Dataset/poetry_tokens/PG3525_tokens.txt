daughter

pledge
of
that
last
night
when
pierced
with
pain
and
delight
she
knew
her
love
and
saw
her
lord
depart
then
breathed
her
wonder
and
her
woe
forlorn
into
a
single
cry
and
thou
wast
born
thou
flower
of
rapture
and
thou
fruit
of
grief
invisible
enchantress
of
the
heart
mistress
of
charms
that
bring
relief
to
sorrow
and
to
joy
impart
a
heavenly
tone
that
keeps
it
undefiled
thou
art
the
child
of
amor
and
by
right
divine
a
throne
of
love
is
thine
thou
queen
whose
bridal
beauty
mortal
eyes
have
never
seen
ii
thou
art
the
angel
of
the
pool
that
sleeps
while
peace
and
joy
lie
hidden
in
its
deeps
waiting
thy
touch
to
make
the
waters
roll
in
healing
murmurs
round
the
weary
soul
ah
when
wilt
thou
draw
near
thou
messenger
of
mercy
robed
in
song
my
lonely
heart
has
listened
for
thee
long
and
now
i
seem
to
hear
across
the
crowded
of
life
thy
measured
ringing
light
and
clear
above
the
unmeaning
noises
and
the
unruly
strife
in
quiet
cadence
sweet
and
slow
serenely
pacing
to
and
fro
thy
steps
are
magical
and
dear
ah
turn
this
way
come
close
and
speak
to
me
from
this
dull
bed
of
languor
set
my
spirit
free
and
bid
me
rise
and
let
me
walk
awhile
with
thee
iii
where
wilt
thou
lead
me
first
in
what
still
region
of
thy
domain
whose
provinces
are
legion
wilt
thou
restore
me
to
myself
again
and
quench
my
heart
long
thirst
i
pray
thee
lay
thy
golden
girdle
down
and
put
away
thy
starry
crown
for
one
dear
restful
hour
assume
a
state
more
mild
clad
only
in
thy
gown
that
breathes
familiar
scent
of
many
a
flower
take
the
low
path
that
leads
thro
pastures
green
and
though
thou
art
a
queen
be
rosamund
awhile
and
in
thy
bower
by
tranquil
love
and
simple
joy
beguiled
sing
to
my
soul
as
mother
to
her
child
iv
o
lead
me
by
the
hand
and
let
my
heart
have
rest
and
bring
me
back
to
childhood
land
to
find
again
the
band
of
playmates
blithe
and
blest
some
quaint
air
that
all
the
children
knew
shall
run
before
us
everywhere
like
a
little
maid
with
flying
hair
to
guide
the
merry
crew
along
the
garden
ways
we
chase
the
tune
and
in
and
out
the
flowery
maze
with
eager
haste
and
fond
delays
in
pleasant
paths
of
june
for
us
the
fields
are
new
for
us
the
woods
are
rife
with
fairy
secrets
deep
and
true
and
heaven
is
but
a
tent
of
blue
above
the
game
of
life
the
world
is
far
away
the
fever
and
the
fret
and
all
that
makes
the
heart
grow
gray
is
out
of
sight
and
far
away
dear
music
while
i
hear
thee
play
that
olden
golden
roundelay
remember
and
forget
sleep
song
forget
forget
the
tide
of
life
is
turning
the
waves
of
light
ebb
slowly
down
the
west
along
the
edge
of
dark
some
stars
are
burning
to
guide
thy
spirit
safely
to
an
isle
of
rest
a
little
rocking
on
the
tranquil
deep
of
song
to
soothe
thy
yearning
a
little
slumber
and
a
little
sleep
and
so
forget
forget
forget
forget
the
day
was
long
in
pleasure
its
echoes
die
away
across
the
hill
now
let
thy
heart
beat
time
to
their
slow
measure
that
swells
and
sinks
and
faints
and
falls
till
all
is
still
then
like
a
weary
child
that
loves
to
keep
locked
in
its
arms
some
treasure
thy
soul
in
calm
content
shall
fall
asleep
and
so
forget
forget
forget
forget
and
if
thou
hast
been
weeping
let
go
the
thoughts
that
bind
thee
to
thy
grief
lie
still
and
watch
the
singing
angels
reaping
the
golden
harvest
of
thy
sorrow
sheaf
by
sheaf
or
count
thy
joys
like
flocks
of
sheep
that
one
by
one
come
creeping
into
the
quiet
fold
until
thou
sleep
and
so
forget
forget
forget
forget
thou
art
a
child
and
knowest
so
little
of
thy
life
but
music
tells
one
secret
of
the
world
thro
which
thou
goest
to
work
with
morning
song
to
rest
with
evening
bells
life
is
in
tune
with
harmony
so
deep
that
when
the
notes
are
lowest
thou
still
canst
lay
thee
down
in
peace
and
sleep
for
god
will
not
forget
vi
hunting
song
out
of
the
garden
of
playtime
out
of
the
bower
of
rest
fain
would
i
follow
at
daytime
music
that
calls
to
a
quest
hark
how
the
galloping
measure
quickens
the
pulses
of
pleasure
gaily
saluting
the
morn
with
the
long
clear
note
of
the
echoing
up
from
the
valley
over
the
mountain
side
rally
you
hunters
rally
rally
and
ride
drink
of
the
magical
potion
music
has
mixed
with
her
wine
full
of
the
madness
of
motion
joyful
exultant
divine
leave
all
your
troubles
behind
you
ride
where
they
never
can
find
you
into
the
gladness
of
morn
with
the
long
clear
note
of
the
swiftly
hillock
and
hollow
sweeping
along
with
the
wind
follow
you
hunters
follow
follow
and
find
what
will
you
reach
with
your
riding
what
is
the
charm
of
the
chase
just
the
delight
and
the
striding
swing
of
the
jubilant
pace
danger
is
sweet
when
you
front
her
in
at
the
death
every
hunter
now
on
the
breeze
the
mort
is
borne
in
the
long
clear
note
of
the
winding
merrily
over
and
over
come
come
come
home
again
ranger
home
again
rover
turn
again
home
vii
now
let
the
blend
with
the
weaving
the
mystical
spell
of
the
dance
lighten
the
deep
tune
soften
the
gay
tune
mingle
a
tempo
that
turns
in
a
trance
half
of
it
sighing
half
of
it
smiling
smoothly
it
swings
with
a
triplicate
beat
calling
replying
yearning
beguiling
wooing
the
heart
and
bewitching
the
feet
every
drop
of
blood
rises
with
the
flood
rocking
on
the
waves
of
the
strain
youth
and
beauty
glide
turning
with
the
tide
music
making
one
out
of
twain
bearing
them
away
and
away
and
away
like
a
tone
and
its
terce
till
the
chord
dissolves
and
the
dancers
stay
and
reverse
violins
leading
take
up
the
measure
turn
with
the
tune
again
clarinets
clear
answer
their
pleading
harps
full
of
pleasure
sprinkle
their
silver
like
light
on
the
mere
semiquaver
notes
merry
little
motes
tangled
in
the
haze
of
the
lamp
golden
rays
quiver
everywhere
in
the
air
like
a
spray
till
the
fuller
stream
of
the
might
of
the
tune
gliding
like
a
dream
in
the
light
of
the
moon
bears
them
all
away
and
away
and
away
floating
in
the
trance
of
the
dance
then
begins
a
measure
stately
languid
slow
serene
all
the
dancers
move
sedately
stepping
leisurely
and
straitly
with
a
courtly
mien
crossing
hands
and
changing
places
bowing
low
between
while
the
minuet
inlaces
waving
arms
and
woven
paces
glittering
damaskeen
where
is
she
whose
form
is
folden
in
its
royal
sheen
from
our
longing
eyes
withholden
by
her
mystic
girdle
golden
beauty
sought
but
never
seen
music
walks
the
maze
a
queen
viii
the
symphony
music
they
do
thee
wrong
who
say
thine
art
is
only
to
enchant
the
sense
for
every
timid
motion
of
the
heart
and
every
passion
too
intense
to
bear
the
chain
of
the
imperfect
word
and
every
tremulous
longing
stirred
by
spirit
winds
that
come
we
know
not
whence
and
go
we
know
not
where
and
every
inarticulate
prayer
beating
about
the
depths
of
pain
or
bliss
like
some
bewildered
bird
that
seeks
its
nest
but
knows
not
where
it
is
and
every
dream
that
haunts
with
dim
delight
the
drowsy
hour
between
the
day
and
night
the
wakeful
hour
between
the
night
and
day
imprisoned
waits
for
thee
impatient
yearns
for
thee
the
queen
who
comes
to
set
the
captive
free
thou
lendest
wings
to
grief
to
fly
away
and
wings
to
joy
to
reach
a
heavenly
height
and
every
dumb
desire
that
storms
within
the
breast
thou
leadest
forth
to
sob
or
sing
itself
to
rest
all
these
are
thine
and
therefore
love
is
thine
for
love
is
joy
and
grief
and
trembling
doubt
and
belief
and
fear
and
hope
and
longing
unexpressed
in
pain
most
human
and
in
rapture
brief
almost
divine
love
would
possess
yet
deepens
when
denied
and
love
would
give
yet
hungers
to
receive
love
like
a
prince
his
triumph
would
achieve
and
like
a
miser
in
the
dark
his
joys
would
hide
love
is
most
bold
he
leads
his
dreams
like
armed
men
in
line
yet
when
the
siege
is
set
and
he
must
speak
calling
the
fortress
to
resign
its
treasure
valiant
love
grows
weak
and
hardly
dares
his
purpose
to
unfold
less
with
his
faltering
lips
than
with
his
eyes
he
claims
the
prize
love
fain
would
tell
it
all
yet
leaves
the
best
untold
but
thou
shalt
speak
for
love
yea
thou
shalt
teach
the
mystery
of
measured
tone
the
pentecostal
speech
that
every
listener
heareth
as
his
own
for
on
thy
head
the
cloven
tongues
of
fire
diminished
chords
that
quiver
with
desire
and
major
chords
that
glow
with
perfect
peace
have
fallen
from
above
and
thou
canst
give
release
in
music
to
the
burdened
heart
of
love
sound
with
the
pleading
passionate
strain
the
yearning
theme
and
let
the
flute
reply
in
placid
melody
while
violins
complain
and
sob
and
sigh
with
muted
string
then
let
the
oboe
sing
of
bliss
that
trembles
on
the
verge
of
pain
while
plead
and
plead
again
with
throbbing
notes
delayed
that
would
impart
to
every
urgent
tone
the
beating
of
the
heart
so
runs
the
andante
making
plain
the
hopes
and
fears
of
love
without
a
word
then
comes
the
adagio
with
a
yielding
theme
through
which
the
violas
flow
soft
as
in
a
dream
while
horns
and
mild
bassoons
are
heard
in
tender
tune
that
seems
to
float
like
an
enchanted
boat
upon
the
stream
toward
the
allegro
wide
bright
sea
of
dancing
glittering
blending
tone
where
every
instrument
is
sounding
free
and
harps
like
are
rung
and
trumpets
blown
around
the
barque
of
love
that
sweeps
with
smiling
skies
above
a
royal
galley
into
the
happy
harbour
of
the
perfect
chord
ix
iris
light
to
the
eye
and
music
to
the
ear
these
are
the
builders
of
the
bridge
that
springs
from
earths
dim
shore
of
things
to
reach
the
spirit
home
the
heavenly
sphere
where
nothing
silent
is
and
nothing
dark
so
when
i
see
the
rainbow
arc
spanning
the
showery
sky
i
hear
music
and
every
colour
sings
and
while
the
symphony
builds
up
its
round
full
sweep
of
architectural
harmony
above
the
tide
of
time
far
far
away
i
see
a
bow
of
colour
in
the
bow
of
sound
red
as
the
dawn
the
trumpet
rings
imperial
purple
from
the
trombone
flows
the
mellow
horn
melts
into
evening
rose
blue
as
the
sky
the
choir
of
strings
darkens
in
to
ocean
hue
rises
in
violins
to
blue
with
threads
of
quivering
light
shot
through
and
through
green
as
the
mantle
that
the
summer
flings
around
the
world
the
pastoral
reeds
in
time
embroider
melodies
of
may
and
june
yellow
as
gold
yea
gold
and
purer
than
the
treasures
of
the
mine
floods
of
the
human
voice
divine
along
the
arch
in
choral
song
are
rolled
so
bends
the
bow
complete
and
radiant
rapture
flows
across
the
bridge
so
full
so
strong
so
sweet
that
the
uplifted
spirit
hardly
knows
whether
the
that
glows
within
the
arch
of
tones
and
colours
seven
is
of
earth
or
of
heaven
x
sea
and
shore
music
i
yield
to
thee
as
swimmer
to
the
sea
i
give
my
spirit
to
the
flood
of
song
bear
me
upon
thy
breast
in
rapture
and
at
rest
bathe
me
in
pure
delight
and
make
me
strong
from
strife
and
struggle
bring
release
and
draw
the
waves
of
passion
into
tides
of
peace
remember
songs
most
dear
in
living
songs
i
hear
while
blending
voices
gently
swing
and
sway
in
melodies
of
love
whose
mighty
currents
move
with
singing
near
and
singing
far
away
sweet
in
the
glow
of
morning
light
and
sweeter
still
across
the
starlit
gulf
of
night
music
in
thee
we
float
and
lose
the
lonely
note
of
self
in
thy
strain
until
at
last
we
find
the
life
to
love
resigned
in
harmony
of
joy
restored
again
and
songs
that
cheered
our
mortal
days
break
on
the
coast
of
light
in
endless
hymns
of
praise
december
may
peace
i
in
excelsis
two
dwellings
peace
are
thine
one
is
the
uplifted
in
the
loneliness
of
light
beyond
the
realm
of
shadows
fine
and
far
and
clear
where
advent
of
the
night
means
only
glorious
nearness
of
the
stars
and
dawn
unhindered
breaks
above
the
bars
that
long
the
lower
world
in
twilight
keep
thou
sleepest
not
and
hast
no
need
of
sleep
for
all
thy
cares
and
fears
have
dropped
away
the
night
fatigue
the
of
day
are
far
below
thee
and
earth
weary
wars
in
vain
expense
of
passion
pass
before
thy
sight
like
visions
in
a
glass
or
like
the
wrinkles
of
the
storm
that
creep
across
the
sea
and
leave
no
trace
of
trouble
on
that
immemorial
face
so
brief
appear
the
conflicts
and
so
slight
the
wounds
men
give
the
things
for
which
they
fight
here
hangs
a
fortress
on
the
distant
steep
a
lichen
clinging
to
the
rock
there
sails
a
fleet
upon
the
deep
a
wandering
flock
of
gulls
and
yonder
in
the
plain
a
marble
palace
shines
a
grain
of
mica
glittering
in
the
rain
beneath
thy
feet
the
clouds
are
rolled
by
voiceless
winds
and
far
between
the
rolling
clouds
new
shores
and
peaks
are
seen
in
shimmering
robes
of
green
and
gold
and
faint
aerial
hue
that
silent
fades
into
the
silent
blue
thou
from
thy
all
day
in
tranquil
wisdom
looking
down
on
distant
scenes
of
human
toil
and
strife
all
night
with
eyes
aware
of
loftier
life
uplooking
to
the
sky
where
stars
are
sown
dost
watch
the
everlasting
fields
grow
white
unto
the
harvest
of
the
sons
of
light
and
welcome
to
thy
sublime
the
few
strong
souls
that
dare
to
climb
the
slippery
crags
and
find
thee
on
the
height
ii
de
profundis
but
in
the
depth
thou
hast
another
home
for
hearts
less
daring
or
more
frail
thou
dwellest
also
in
the
shadowy
vale
and
that
roam
with
weary
feet
hill
and
dale
bearing
the
burden
and
the
heat
of
toilful
days
turn
from
the
dusty
ways
to
find
thee
in
thy
green
and
still
retreat
here
is
no
vision
wide
outspread
before
the
lonely
and
exalted
seat
of
knowledge
here
instead
a
little
garden
and
a
sheltered
nook
with
outlooks
brief
and
sweet
across
the
meadows
and
along
the
brook
a
little
stream
that
little
knows
of
the
great
sea
towards
which
it
gladly
flows
a
little
field
that
bears
a
little
wheat
to
make
a
portion
of
earth
daily
bread
the
vast
overhead
are
marshalled
and
the
wild
wind
blows
its
trumpet
but
thou
canst
not
tell
whence
the
storm
comes
nor
where
it
goes
nor
dost
thou
greatly
care
since
all
is
well
thy
daily
task
is
done
and
though
a
lowly
one
thou
gavest
it
of
thy
best
and
art
content
to
rest
in
patience
till
its
slow
reward
is
won
not
far
thou
lookest
but
thy
sight
is
clear
not
much
thou
knowest
but
thy
faith
is
dear
for
life
is
love
and
love
is
always
near
here
friendship
lights
the
fire
and
every
heart
sure
of
itself
and
sure
of
all
the
rest
dares
to
be
true
and
gladly
takes
its
part
in
open
converse
bringing
forth
its
best
here
is
sweet
music
melting
every
chain
of
lassitude
and
pain
and
here
at
last
is
sleep
the
gift
of
gifts
the
tender
nurse
who
lifts
the
soul
grown
weary
of
the
waking
world
and
lays
it
with
its
thoughts
all
furled
its
fears
forgotten
and
its
passions
still
on
the
deep
bosom
of
the
eternal

set
thine
altars
everywhere
on
mountain
heights
in
woodlands
dim
with
many
a
dream
in
valleys
bright
with
springs
and
on
the
curving
capes
of
every
stream
thou
who
hast
taken
to
thyself
the
wings
of
morning
to
abide
upon
the
secret
places
of
the
sea
and
on
far

ii
seeking
for
thee
the
heart
of
man
lonely
and
longing
ran
in
that
first
solitary
hour
when
the
mysterious
power
to
know
and
love
the
wonder
of
the
morn
was
breathed
within
him
and
his
soul
was
born
and
thou
didst
meet
thy
child
not
in
some
hidden
shrine
but
in
the
freedom
of
the
garden
wild
and
take
his
hand
in
thine
there
all
day
long
in
paradise
he
walked
and
in
the
cool
of
evening
with
thee
talked
iii
lost
long
ago
that
garden
bright
and
pure
lost
that
calm
day
too
perfect
to
endure
and
lost
the
childlike
love
that
worshipped
and
was
sure
for
men
have
dulled
their
eyes
with
sin
and
dimmed
the
light
of
heaven
with
doubt
and
built
their
temple
walls
to
shut
thee
in
and
framed
their
iron
creeds
to
shut
thee
out
but
not
for
thee
the
closing
of
the
door
o
spirit
unconfined
thy
ways
are
free
as
is
the
wandering
wind
and
thou
hast
wooed
thy
children
to
restore
their
fellowship
with
thee
in
peace
of
soul
and
simpleness
of
mind
iv
joyful
the
heart
that
when
the
flood
rolled
by
leaped
up
to
see
the
rainbow
in
the
sky
and
glad
the
pilgrim
in
the
lonely
night
for
whom
the
hills
of
haran
tier
on
tier
built
up
a
secret
stairway
to
the
height
where
stars
like
angel
eyes
were
shining
clear
from
in
many
a
land
and
age
disciples
of
the
persian
seer
have
hailed
the
rising
sun
and
worshipped
thee
and
wayworn
followers
of
the
indian
sage
have
found
the
peace
of
god
beneath
a
spreading
tree
but
one
but
one
ah
child
most
dear
and
perfect
image
of
the
love
unseen
walked
every
day
in
pastures
green
and
all
his
life
the
quiet
waters
by
reading
their
beauty
with
a
tranquil
eye
to
him
the
desert
was
a
place
prepared
for
weary
hearts
to
rest
the
hillside
was
a
temple
blest
the
grassy
vale
a
where
he
could
feed
and
comfort
many
a
guest
with
him
the
lily
shared
the
vital
joy
that
breathes
itself
in
bloom
and
every
bird
that
sang
beside
the
nest
told
of
the
love
that
broods
every
living
thing
he
watched
the
shepherd
bring
his
flock
at
sundown
to
the
welcome
fold
the
fisherman
at
daybreak
fling
his
net
across
the
waters
gray
and
cold
and
all
day
long
the
patient
reaper
swing
his
curving
sickle
through
the
so
through
the
world
the
way
he
trod
drawing
the
air
of
heaven
in
every
breath
and
in
the
evening
sacrifice
of
death
beneath
the
open
sky
he
gave
his
soul
to
god
him
will
i
trust
and
for
my
master
take
him
will
i
follow
and
for
his
dear
sake
god
of
the
open
air
to
thee
i
make
my
prayer
v
from
the
prison
of
anxious
thought
that
greed
has
builded
from
the
fetters
that
envy
has
wrought
and
pride
has
gilded
from
the
noise
of
the
crowded
ways
and
the
fierce
confusion
from
the
folly
that
wastes
its
days
in
a
world
of
illusion
ah
but
the
life
is
lost
that
frets
and
languishes
there
i
would
escape
and
be
free
in
the
joy
of
the
open
air
by
the
breadth
of
the
blue
that
shines
in
silence
me
by
the
length
of
the
that
stretch
before
me
by
the
height
of
the
cloud
that
sails
with
rest
in
motion
over
the
plains
and
the
vales
to
the
measureless
ocean
oh
how
the
sight
of
the
things
that
are
great
enlarges
the
eyes
lead
me
out
of
the
narrow
life
to
the
peace
of
the
hills
and
the
skies
while
the
tremulous
leafy
haze
on
the
woodland
is
spreading
and
the
bloom
on
the
meadow
betrays
where
may
has
been
treading
while
the
birds
on
the
branches
above
and
the
brooks
flowing
under
are
singing
together
of
love
in
a
world
full
of
wonder
lo
in
the
marvel
of
springtime
dreams
are
changed
into
truth
quicken
my
heart
and
restore
the
beautiful
hopes
of
youth
by
the
faith
that
the
flowers
show
when
they
bloom
unbidden
by
the
calm
of
the
river
flow
to
a
goal
that
is
hidden
by
the
trust
of
the
tree
that
clings
to
its
deep
foundation
by
the
courage
of
wild
birds
wings
on
the
long
migration
wonderful
secret
of
peace
that
abides
in
nature
breast
teach
me
how
to
confide
and
live
my
life
and
rest
for
the
comforting
warmth
of
the
sun
that
my
body
embraces
for
the
cool
of
the
waters
that
run
through
the
shadowy
places
for
the
balm
of
the
breezes
that
brush
my
face
with
their
fingers
for
the
of
the
thrush
when
the
twilight
lingers
for
the
long
breath
the
deep
breath
the
breath
of
a
heart
without
care
i
will
give
thanks
and
adore
thee
god
of
the
open
air
vi
these
are
the
gifts
i
ask
of
thee
spirit
serene
strength
for
the
daily
task
courage
to
face
the
road
good
cheer
to
help
me
bear
the
traveller
load
and
for
the
hours
of
rest
that
come
between
an
inward
joy
in
all
things
heard
and
seen
these
are
the
sins
i
fain
would
have
thee
take
away
malice
and
cold
disdain
hot
anger
sullen
hate
scorn
of
the
lowly
envy
of
the
great
and
discontent
that
casts
a
shadow
gray
on
all
the
brightness
of
the
common
day
these
are
the
things
i
prize
and
hold
of
dearest
worth
light
of
the
sapphire
skies
peace
of
the
silent
hills
shelter
of
forests
comfort
of
the
grass
music
of
birds
murmur
of
little
rills
shadow
of
clouds
that
swiftly
pass
and
after
showers
the
smell
of
flowers
and
of
the
good
brown
earth
and
best
of
all
along
the
way
friendship
and
mirth
so
let
me
keep
these
treasures
of
the
humble
heart
in
true
possession
owning
them
by
love
and
when
at
last
i
can
no
longer
move
among
them
freely
but
must
part
from
the
green
fields
and
from
the
waters
clear
let
me
not
creep
into
some
darkened
room
and
hide
from
all
that
makes
the
world
so
bright
and
dear
but
throw
the
windows
wide
to
welcome
in
the
light
and
while
i
clasp
a
hand
let
me
once
more
have
sight
of
the
deep
sky
and
the
land
then
gently
fall
on
sleep
and
breathe
my
body
back
to
nature
care
my
spirit
out
to
thee
god
of
the
open
air
sonnets
work
let
me
but
do
my
work
from
day
to
day
in
field
or
forest
at
the
desk
or
loom
in
roaring
or
tranquil
room
let
me
but
find
it
in
my
heart
to
say
when
vagrant
wishes
beckon
me
astray
this
is
my
work
my
blessing
not
my
doom
of
all
who
live
i
am
the
one
by
whom
this
work
can
best
be
done
in
the
right
way
then
shall
i
see
it
not
too
great
nor
small
to
suit
my
spirit
and
to
prove
my
powers
then
shall
i
cheerful
greet
the
labouring
hours
and
cheerful
turn
when
the
long
shadows
fall
at
eventide
to
play
and
love
and
rest
because
i
know
for
me
my
work
is
best
april
life
let
me
but
live
my
life
from
year
to
year
with
forward
face
and
unreluctant
soul
not
hurrying
to
nor
turning
from
the
goal
not
mourning
for
the
things
that
disappear
in
the
dim
past
nor
holding
back
in
fear
from
what
the
future
veils
but
with
a
whole
and
happy
heart
that
pays
its
toll
to
youth
and
age
and
travels
on
with
cheer
so
let
the
way
wind
up
the
hill
or
down
rough
or
smooth
the
journey
will
be
joy
still
seeking
what
i
sought
when
but
a
boy
new
friendship
high
adventure
and
a
crown
my
heart
will
keep
the
courage
of
the
quest
and
hope
the
road
last
turn
will
be
the
best
may
love
let
me
but
love
my
love
without
disguise
nor
wear
a
mask
of
fashion
old
or
new
nor
wait
to
speak
till
i
can
hear
a
clue
nor
play
a
part
to
shine
in
others
eyes
nor
bow
my
knees
to
what
my
heart
denies
but
what
i
am
to
that
let
me
be
true
and
let
me
worship
where
my
love
is
due
and
so
through
love
and
worship
let
me
rise
for
love
is
but
the
heart
immortal
thirst
to
be
completely
known
and
all
forgiven
even
as
sinful
souls
that
enter
heaven
so
take
me
dear
and
understand
my
worst
and
freely
pardon
it
because
confessed
and
let
me
find
in
loving
thee
my
best
may
the
child
in
the
garden
when
to
the
garden
of
untroubled
thought
i
came
of
late
and
saw
the
open
door
and
wished
again
to
enter
and
explore
the
sweet
wild
ways
with
stainless
bloom
inwrought
and
bowers
of
innocence
with
beauty
fraught
it
seemed
some
purer
voice
must
speak
before
i
dared
to
tread
that
garden
loved
of
yore
that
eden
lost
unknown
and
found
unsought
then
just
within
the
gate
i
saw
a
child
a
yet
to
my
heart
most
dear
he
held
his
hands
to
me
and
softly
smiled
with
eyes
that
knew
no
shade
of
sin
or
fear
come
in
he
said
and
play
awhile
with
me
i
am
the
little
child
you
used
to
be
january
love
reason
for
that
thy
face
is
fair
i
love
thee
not
nor
yet
because
the
light
of
thy
brown
eyes
hath
gleams
of
wonder
and
of
glad
surprise
like
woodland
streams
that
cross
a
sunlit
spot
nor
for
thy
beauty
born
without
a
blot
most
perfect
when
it
shines
through
no
disguise
pure
as
the
star
of
eve
in
paradise
for
all
these
outward
things
i
love
thee
not
but
for
a
something
in
thy
form
and
face
thy
looks
and
ways
of
primal
harmony
a
certain
soothing
charm
a
vital
grace
that
breathes
of
the
eternal
womanly
and
makes
me
feel
the
warmth
of
nature
breast
when
in
her
arms
and
thine
i
sink
to
rest
february
portrait
and
reality
if
on
the
closed
curtain
of
my
sight
my
fancy
paints
thy
portrait
far
away
i
see
thee
still
the
same
by
night
or
day
crossing
the
crowded
street
or
moving
bright
festal
throngs
or
reading
by
the
light
of
shaded
lamp
some
friendly
poet
lay
or
shepherding
the
children
at
their
play
the
same
sweet
self
and
my
unchanged
delight
but
when
i
see
thee
near
i
recognize
in
every
dear
familiar
way
some
strange
perfection
and
behold
in
april
guise
the
magic
of
thy
beauty
that
doth
range
through
many
moods
with
infinite
surprise
never
the
same
and
sweeter
with
each
change
may
the
wind
of
sorrow
the
fire
of
love
was
burning
yet
so
low
that
in
the
dark
we
scarce
could
see
its
rays
and
in
the
light
of
days
nothing
but
smouldering
embers
dull
and
slow
vainly
for
love
delight
we
sought
to
throw
new
pleasures
on
the
pyre
to
make
it
blaze
in
life
calm
air
and
ways
we
missed
the
radiant
heat
of
long
ago
then
in
the
night
a
night
of
sad
alarms
bitter
with
pain
and
black
with
fog
of
fears
that
drove
us
trembling
to
each
other
arms
across
the
gulf
of
darkness
and
salt
tears
into
life
calm
the
wind
of
sorrow
came
and
fanned
the
fire
of
love
to
clearest
flame

would
not

ask

would
not

to
dream

to
tell

hold
my

one
day
report
from
those
who
came
with
pitying
sorrow
or
exultant
joy
to
tell
of
earthly
tasks
in
his
employ
for
some
were
sorry
when
they
saw
how
slow
the
stream
of
heavenly
love
on
earth
must
flow
and
some
were
glad
because
their
eyes
had
seen
along
its
banks
fresh
flowers
and
living
green
so
at
a
certain
hour
before
the
throne
the
youngest
angel
asmiel
stood
alone
nor
glad
nor
sad
but
full
of
earnest
thought
and
thus
his
tidings
to
the
master
brought
lord
in
the
city
lupon
i
have
found
three
servants
of
thy
holy
name
renowned
above
their
fellows
one
is
very
wise
with
thoughts
that
ever
range
above
the
skies
and
one
is
gifted
with
the
golden
speech
that
makes
men
glad
to
hear
when
he
will
teach
and
one
with
no
rare
gift
or
grace
endued
has
won
the
people
love
by
doing
good
with
three
such
saints
lupon
is
trebly
blest
but
lord
i
fain
would
know
which
loves
thee
best
then
spake
the
lord
of
angels
to
whose
look
the
hearts
of
all
are
like
an
open
book
in
every
soul
the
secret
thought
i
read
and
well
i
know
who
loves
me
best
indeed
but
every
life
has
pages
vacant
still
whereon
a
man
may
write
the
thing
he
will
therefore
i
read
in
silence
day
by
day
and
wait
for
hearts
untaught
to
learn
my
way
but
thou
shalt
go
to
lupon
to
the
three
who
serve
me
there
and
take
this
word
from
me
tell
each
of
them
his
master
bids
him
go
alone
to
spiran
huts
across
the
snow
there
he
shall
find
a
certain
task
for
me
but
what
i
do
not
tell
to
them
nor
thee
give
thou
the
message
make
my
word
the
test
and
crown
for
me
the
one
who
answers
best
silent
the
angel
stood
with
folded
hands
to
take
the
imprint
of
his
lord
commands
then
drew
one
breath
obedient
and
elate
and
passed
the
hour
through
lupon
gate
first
to
the
temple
door
he
made
his
way
and
there
because
it
was
an
he
saw
the
folk
by
thousands
thronging
stirred
by
ardent
thirst
to
hear
the
preacher
word
then
while
the
echoes
murmured
bernol
name
through
aisles
that
hushed
behind
him
bernol
came
strung
to
the
keenest
pitch
of
conscious
might
with
lips
prepared
and
firm
and
eyes
alight
one
moment
at
the
pulpit
steps
he
knelt
in
silent
prayer
and
on
his
shoulder
felt
the
angel
hand
the
master
bids
thee
go
alone
to
spiran
huts
across
the
snow
to
serve
him
there
then
bernol
hidden
face
went
white
as
death
and
for
about
the
space
of
ten
slow
there
was
no
reply
till
bernol
looked
around
and
whispered
why
but
answer
to
his
question
came
there
none
the
angel
sighed
and
with
a
sigh
was
gone
within
the
humble
house
where
malvin
spent
his
studious
years
on
holy
things
intent
sweet
stillness
reigned
and
there
the
angel
found
the
saintly
sage
immersed
in
thought
profound
weaving
with
patient
toil
and
willing
care
a
web
of
wisdom
wonderful
and
fair
a
seamless
robe
for
truth
great
bridal
meet
and
needing
but
one
thread
to
be
complete
then
asmiel
touched
his
hand
and
broke
the
thread
of
thought
and
very
gently
said
the
one
of
whom
thou
thinkest
bids
thee
go
alone
to
spiran
huts
across
the
snow
to
serve
him
there
with
sorrow
and
surprise
malvin
looked
up
reluctance
in
his
eyes
the
broken
thought
the
strangeness
of
the
call
the
perilous
passage
of
the
the
solitary
journey
and
the
length
of
ways
unknown
too
great
for
his
frail
strength
appalled
him
with
a
doubtful
brow
he
scanned
the
doubtful
task
and
muttered
how
but
asmiel
answered
as
he
turned
to
go
with
cold
disheartened
voice
i
do
not
know
now
as
he
went
with
fading
hope
to
seek
the
third
and
last
to
whom
god
bade
him
speak
scarce
twenty
steps
away
whom
should
he
meet
but
fermor
hurrying
cheerful
down
the
street
with
ready
heart
that
faced
his
work
like
play
and
joyed
to
find
it
greater
every
day
the
angel
stopped
him
with
uplifted
hand
and
gave
without
delay
his
lord
command
he
whom
thou
servest
here
would
have
thee
go
alone
to
spiran
huts
across
the
snow
to
serve
him
there
ere
asmiel
breathed
again
the
eager
answer
leaped
to
meet
him
when
the
angel
face
with
inward
joy
grew
bright
and
all
his
figure
glowed
with
heavenly
light
he
took
the
golden
circlet
from
his
brow
and
gave
the
crown
to
fermor
answering
now
for
thou
hast
met
the
master
bidden
test
and
i
have
found
the
man
who
loves
him
best
not
thine
nor
mine
to
question
or
reply
when
he
commands
us
asking
or
he
knows
the
cause
his
ways
are
wise
and
just
who
serves
the
king
must
serve
with
perfect
trust
february
the
vain
king
in
robes
of
tyrian
blue
the
king
was
drest
a
jewelled
collar
shone
upon
his
breast
a
giant
ruby
glittered
in
his
crown
lord
of
rich
lands
and
many
a
splendid
town
in
him
the
glories
of
an
ancient
line
of
sober
kings
who
ruled
by
right
divine
were
centred
and
to
him
with
loyal
awe
the
people
looked
for
leadership
and
law
ten
thousand
knights
the
safeguard
of
the
land
lay
like
a
single
sword
within
his
hand
a
hundred
courts
with
power
of
life
and
death
proclaimed
decrees
of
justice
by
his
breath
and
all
the
sacred
growths
that
men
had
known
of
order
and
of
rule
upheld
his
throne
proud
was
the
king
yet
not
with
such
a
heart
as
fits
a
man
to
play
a
royal
part
not
his
the
pride
that
honours
as
a
trust
the
right
to
rule
the
duty
to
be
just
not
his
the
dignity
that
bends
to
bear
the
monarch
yoke
the
master
load
of
care
and
labours
like
the
peasant
at
his
gate
to
serve
the
people
and
protect
the
state
another
pride
was
his
and
other
joys
to
him
the
crown
and
sceptre
were
but
toys
with
which
he
played
at
glory
idle
game
to
please
himself
and
win
the
wreaths
of
fame
the
throne
his
fathers
held
from
age
to
age
to
his
ambition
seemed
a
fitting
stage
built
for
king
martin
to
display
at
will
his
mighty
strength
and
universal
skill
no
conscious
child
that
spoiled
with
praising
tries
at
every
step
to
win
admiring
eyes
no
favourite
mountebank
whose
acting
draws
from
gaping
crowds
loud
thunder
of
applause
was
vainer
than
the
king
his
only
thirst
was
to
be
hailed
in
every
race
the
first
when
tournament
was
held
in
knightly
guise
the
king
would
ride
the
lists
and
win
the
prize
when
music
charmed
the
court
with
golden
lyre
the
king
would
take
the
stage
and
lead
the
choir
in
hunting
his
the
lance
to
slay
the
boar
in
hawking
see
his
falcon
highest
soar
in
painting
he
would
wield
the
master
brush
in
high
debate
the
king
is
speaking
hush
thus
with
a
restless
heart
in
every
field
he
sought
renown
and
found
his
subjects
yield
as
if
he
were
a
revealed
but
while
he
played
the
petty
games
of
life
his
kingdom
fell
a
prey
to
inward
strife
corruption
through
the
court
unheeded
crept
and
on
the
seat
of
honour
justice
slept
the
strong
trod
down
the
weak
the
helpless
poor
groaned
under
burdens
grievous
to
endure
the
nation
wealth
was
spent
in
vain
display
and
weakness
wore
the
nation
heart
away
yet
think
not
earth
is
blind
to
human
woes
man
has
more
friends
and
helpers
than
he
knows
and
when
a
patient
people
are
oppressed
the
land
that
bore
them
feels
it
in
her
breast
spirits
of
field
and
flood
of
heath
and
hill
are
grieved
and
angry
at
the
spreading
ill
the
trees
complain
together
in
the
night
voices
of
wrath
are
heard
along
the
height
and
secret
vows
are
sworn
by
stream
and
strand
to
bring
the
tyrant
low
and
liberate
the
land
but
little
recked
the
pampered
king
of
these
he
heard
no
voice
but
such
as
praise
and
please
flattered
and
fooled
victor
in
every
sport
one
day
he
wandered
idly
with
his
court
beside
the
river
seeking
to
devise
new
ways
to
show
his
skill
to
wondering
eyes
there
in
the
stream
a
patient
fisher
stood
and
cast
his
line
across
the
rippling
flood
his
silver
spoil
lay
near
him
on
the
green
such
fish
the
courtiers
cried
were
never
seen
three
salmon
longer
than
a
shaft
this
man
must
be
the
master
of
his
craft
an
easy
art
the
jealous
king
replied
myself
could
learn
it
better
if
i
tried
and
catch
a
hundred
larger
fish
a
week
wilt
thou
accept
the
challenge
fellow
speak
the
fisher
turned
came
near
and
bent
his
knee
is
not
for
kings
to
strive
with
such
as
me
yet
if
the
king
commands
it
i
obey
but
one
condition
of
the
strife
i
pray
the
fisherman
who
brings
the
least
to
land
shall
do
the
other
may
command
loud
laughed
the
king
a
foolish
fisher
thou
for
i
shall
win
and
rule
thee
then
as
now
so
to
prince
john
a
sober
soul
sedate
and
slow
king
martin
left
the
helm
of
state
while
to
the
novel
game
with
eager
zest
he
all
his
time
and
all
his
powers
addrest
sure
such
a
sight
was
never
seen
before
for
robed
and
crowned
the
monarch
trod
the
shore
his
golden
hooks
were
decked
with
feathers
fine
his
jewelled
reel
ran
out
a
silken
line
with
kingly
strokes
he
flogged
the
crystal
stream
the
salmon
saw
his
tackle
gleam
careless
of
kings
they
eyed
with
calm
disdain
the
gaudy
lure
and
martin
fished
in
vain
on
friday
when
the
week
was
almost
spent
he
scanned
his
empty
creel
with
discontent
called
for
a
net
and
cast
it
far
and
wide
and
drew
a
thousand
minnows
from
the
tide
then
came
the
fisher
to
conclude
the
match
and
at
the
monarch
feet
spread
out
his
catch
a
hundred
salmon
greater
than
before
i
win
he
cried
the
king
must
pay
the
score
then
martin
angry
threw
his
tackle
down
rather
than
lose
this
game
i
lose
my
crown
nay
thou
hast
lost
them
both
the
fisher
said
and
as
he
spoke
a
wondrous
light
was
shed
around
his
form
he
dropped
his
garments
mean
and
in
his
place
the
was
seen
thy
vanity
hast
brought
thee
in
my
power
and
thou
shalt
pay
the
forfeit
at
this
hour
for
thou
hast
shown
thyself
a
royal
fool
too
proud
to
angle
and
too
vain
to
rule
eager
to
win
in
every
trivial
strife
go
thou
shalt
fish
for
minnows
all
thy
life
wrathful
the
king
the
scornful
sentence
heard
he
strove
to
answer
but
he
only
his
tyrian
robe
was
changed
to
wings
of
blue
his
crown
became
a
crest
away
he
flew
and
still
along
the
reaches
of
the
stream
the
vain
flits
an
azure
gleam
you
see
his
ruby
crest
you
hear
his
jealous
scream

lyrics
a
mile
with
me
o
who
will
walk
a
mile
with
me
along
life
merry
way
a
comrade
blithe
and
full
of
glee
who
dares
to
laugh
out
loud
and
free
and
let
his
frolic
fancy
play
like
a
happy
child
through
the
flowers
gay
that
fill
the
field
and
fringe
the
way
where
he
walks
a
mile
with
me
and
who
will
walk
a
mile
with
me
along
life
weary
way
a
friend
whose
heart
has
eyes
to
see
the
stars
shine
out
the
darkening
lea
and
the
quiet
rest
at
the
end
o
the
day
a
friend
who
knows
and
dares
to
say
the
brave
sweet
words
that
cheer
the
way
where
he
walks
a
mile
with
me
with
such
a
comrade
such
a
friend
i
fain
would
walk
till
journeys
end
through
summer
sunshine
winter
rain
and
then
farewell
we
shall
meet
again
december
spring
in
the
south
now
in
the
oak
the
sap
of
life
is
welling
tho
to
the
bough
the
rusty
leafage
clings
now
on
the
elm
the
misty
buds
are
swelling
see
how
the
grows
alive
with
wings
fluttering
yodeling
and
crying
sailing
low
above
the
faded
grass
whistling
clear
silent
robins
flying
who
has
waked
the
birds
up
what
has
come
to
pass
last
year
desolately
bowing
tremble
in
the
ragged
and
forlorn
red
are
the
of
the
early
ploughing
gray
are
the
lowlands
waiting
for
the
corn
earth
seems
asleep
still
but
she
only
feigning
deep
in
her
bosom
thrills
a
sweet
unrest
look
where
the
jasmine
lavishly
is
raining
jove
golden
shower
into
danae
breast
now
on
the
plum
the
snowy
bloom
is
sifted
now
on
the
peach
the
glory
of
the
rose
over
the
hills
a
tender
haze
is
drifted
full
to
the
brim
the
yellow
river
flows
dark
cypress
boughs
with
vivid
jewels
glisten
greener
than
emeralds
shining
in
the
sun
who
has
wrought
the
magic
listen
sweetheart
listen
the

singing
spring
has
begun
hark
in
his
song
no
tremor
of
misgiving
all
of
his
heart
he
pours
into
his
lay
love
love
love
and
pure
delight
of
living

a
happy
day
fair
in

snowy
on
your

and
rosy
on
your

sweet
in
your

i

the

i
think
of
thee
when
golden
sunbeams

across

and
when
the
waves
reflect
the

pale
glimmer
i
think
of
thee
i
see
thy
form
when
down
the
distant
highway
the
rise
in
deepest
night
above
the
mountain
i
see
thine
eyes
i
hear
thee
when
the
returning
loudly
rejoice
and
on
the
lonely
moor
in
stillness
yearning
i
hear
thy
voice
i
dwell
with
thee
though
thou

far
removed
yet

two
schools
i
put
my
heart
to
school
in
the
world
where
men
grow
wise
go
out
i
said
and
learn
the
rule
come
back
when
you
win
a
prize
my
heart
came
back
again
now
where
is
the
prize
i
the
rule
was
false
and
the
prize
was
pain
and
the
teacher
name
was
pride
i
put
my
heart
to
school
in
the
woods
where
veeries
sing
and
brooks
run
cool
and
clear
in
the
fields
where
wild
flowers
spring
and
the
blue
of
heaven
bends
near
go
out
i
said
you
are
half
a
fool
but
perhaps
they
can
teach
you
here
and
why
do
you
stay
so
long
my
heart
and
where
do
you
roam
the
answer
came
with
a
laugh
and
a
song

deepening
glow
of
life

from
thee
as
once
upon
her
breast

heart
on
thee

away
her
every
wish

and
even
if
thou
must
refuse
in
anything
let
thy
wise
will
a
comfort
bring
such
as
kind
mothers

ah
hold
her
by
the
hand
as
once
her
hand
held
mine
and
though
she
may
not
understand
life
winding
way
lead
her
in
peace
divine
i
can
not
pay
my
debt
for
all
the
love
that
she
has
given
but
thou
love
lord
wilt
not
forget
her
due
reward
bless
her
in
earth
and
heaven
july
indian
summer
a
soft
veil
dims
the
tender
skies
and
half
conceals
from
pensive
eyes
the
bronzing
tokens
of
the
fall
a
calmness
broods
upon
the
hills
and
summer
parting
dream
distills
a
charm
of
silence
over
all
the
stacks
of
corn
in
brown
array
stand
waiting
through
the
placid
day
like
tattered
wigwams
on
the
plain
the
tribes
that
find
a
shelter
there
are
phantom
peoples
forms
of
air
and
ghosts
of
vanished
joy
and
pain
at
evening
when
the
crimson
crest
of
sunset
passes
down
the
west
i
hear
the
whispering
host
returning
on
fields
by
elm
and
oak
i
see
the
lights
i
smell
the
smoke
the
of
the

all
the
flocks
of
fleecy
clouds
have
wandered
past
the
hill
through
the
noonday
silence
down
the
woods
of
june
hark
a
little
hunter
voice
comes
running
with
a
tune
hide
and
seek
when
i
speak
you
must
answer
me
call
again
merry
men
now
i
hear
his
footsteps
rustling
through
the
grass
hidden
in
my
leafy
nook
shall
i
let
him
pass
just
a
low
soft
whistle
quick
the
hunter
turns
leaps
upon
me
laughing
rolls
me
in
the
ferns
hold
him
fast
caught
at
last
now

your
eye
till
i
cry
ii
long
ago
he
left
me
long
and
long
ago
now
i
wander
through
the
world
and
seek
him
high
and
low
hidden
safe
and
happy
in
some
pleasant
place
ah
if
i
could
hear
his
voice
i
soon
should
find
his
face
far
away
many
a
day
where
can
barney

do
you
hear

that
in
the
thrilled
his
heart
with
joy

he
loved
to
pick
for
me
mind
me
of
my
boy
surely
he
is
waiting
till
my
steps
come
nigh

may
hide
itself
awhile

january
dulcis

long
long
ago
i
heard
a
little
song
ah
was
it
long
ago
or
yesterday
so
lowly
slowly
wound
the
tune
along
that
far
into
my
heart
it
found
the
way
a
melody
consoling
and
endearing
and
still
in
silent
hours
i
often
hearing
the
small
sweet
song
that
does
not
die
away
long
long
ago
i
saw
a
little
flower
ah
was
it
long
ago
or
yesterday
so
fair
of
face
and
fragrant
for
an
hour
that
something
dear
to
me
it
seemed
to
say
a
thought
of
joy
that
blossomed
into
being
without
a
word
and
now
i
often
seeing
the
friendly
flower
that
does
not
fade
away
long
long
ago
we
had
a
little
child
ah
was
it
long
ago
or
yesterday
into
his
mother
eyes
and
mine
he
smiled
unconscious
love
warm
in
our
arms
he
lay
an
angel
called
dear
heart
we
could
not
hold
him
yet
secretly
your
arms
and
mine
infold
him
our
little
child
who
does
not
go
away
long
long
ago
ah
memory
make
it
clear
it
was
not
long
ago
but
yesterday
so
little
and
so
helpless
and
so
dear
let
not
the
song
be
lost
the
flower
decay
his
voice
his
waking
eyes
his
gentle
sleeping
the
smallest
things
are
safest
in
thy
keeping
sweet
memory
keep
our
child
with
us
alway
april
autumn
in
the
garden
when
the
frosty
kiss
of
autumn
in
the
dark
makes
its
mark
on
the
flowers
and
the
misty
morning
grieves
over
fallen
leaves
then
my
olden
garden
where
the
golden
soil
through
the
toil
of
a
hundred
years
is
mellow
rich
and
deep
whispers
in
its
sleep
the
crumpled
beds
of
marigold
and
phlox
where
the
box
borders
with
its
glossy
green
the
ancient
walks
there
a
voice
that
talks
of
the
human
hopes
that
bloomed
and
withered
here
year
by
year
dreams
of
joy
that
brightened
all
the
labouring
hours
fading
as
the
flowers
yet
the
whispered
story
does
not
deepen
grief
but
relief
for
the
loneliness
of
sorrow
seems
to
flow
from
the
when
i
think
of
other
lives
that
learned
like
mine
to
resign
and
remember
that
the
sadness
of
the
fall
comes
alike
to
all
what
regrets
what
longings
for
the
lost
were
theirs
and
what
prayers
for
the
silent
strength
that
nerves
us
to
endure
things
we
can
not
cure
pacing
up
and
down
the
garden
where
they
paced
i
have
traced
all
their
paths
of
patience
till
i
find
comfort
in
my
mind
faint
and
far
away
their
ancient
griefs
appear
yet
how
near
is
the
tender
voice
the
careworn
kindly
face
of
the
human
race
let
us
walk
together
in
the
garden
dearest
heart
not
apart
they
who
know
the
sorrows
other
lives
have
known
never
walk
alone

the
message
waking
from
tender
sleep
my
neighbour
little
child
put
out
his
baby
hand
to
me
looked
in
my
face
and
smiled
it
seemed
as
if
he
came
home
from
a
happy
land
to
tell
me
something
that
my
heart
would
surely
understand
somewhere
among
bright
dreams
a
child
that
once
was
mine
had
whispered
wordless
love
to
him
and
given
him
a
sign
comfort
of
kindly
speech
and
counsel
of
the
wise
have
helped
me
less
than
what
i
read
in
those
eyes

sweetly

again
of

of
