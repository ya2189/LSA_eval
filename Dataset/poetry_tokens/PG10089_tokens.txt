elves
and
heroes

preface
the
elves
the
immemorial
of
our
native
land
are
passing
away
but
they
still
retain
for
us
a
poetic
appeal
not
only
on
account
of
the
glamour
of
early
associations
but
also
because
they
afford
us
inviting
glimpses
of
the
mental
habits
and
inherent
characteristics
of
the
men
and
women
of
past
generations
when
we
the
old
tales
of
our
ancestors
we
sit
beside
them
over
the
and
as
we
glory
with
them
in
their
strong
heroes
and
share
their
elemental
joys
and
fears
we
breathe
the
palpitating
air
of
that
old
mysterious
world
of
theirs
peopled
by
spirits
beautiful
and
strange
and
the
attitude
of
the
gael
towards
the
supernatural
and
his
general
outlook
upon
life
in
times
gone
by
was
not
associated
with
unbroken
gloom
nor
was
he
always
an
ineffectual
dreamer
and
melancholy
fatalist
these
attributes
belong
chiefly
to
the
literary
celt
of
conception
the
celt
of
arnold
and
renan
and
other
writers
following
in
their
wake
who
have
woven
misty
impressions
of
a
people
whom
they
have
met
as
strangers
and
never
really
understood
celtic
literature
is
not
a
morbid
literature
in
highland
poetry
there
is
more
light
than
shadow
much
symbolism
but
no
vagueness
pictures
are
presented
in
minute
detail
stanzas
are
cunningly
wrought
in
a
spirit
of
keen
artistry
and
the
literary
style
is
direct
and
clear
and
comprehensible
in
highland
folklore
we
find
associated
with
the
haunting
fear
of
things
invisible
common
to
all
peoples
in
early
stages
of
development
a
confident
feeling
of
security
inspired
by
the
minute
observances
of
ceremonial
practices
we
also
note
a
distinct
tendency
to
discriminate
between
spirits
some
of
which
are
invariably
friendly
some
merely
picturesque
and
perhaps
fearsome
and
others
constantly
harbouring
a
desire
to
work
evil
upon
mankind
associated
with
belief
in
the
efficacy
of
propitiatory
offerings
and
ceremonies
of
riddance
is
the
ethical
suggestion
that
good
wishes
and
good
deeds
influence
spirits
to
perform
acts
of
kindly
intent
of
fairies
the
highlanders
spoke
as
they
are
still
prone
to
do
in
these
districts
where
belief
in
them
is
not
yet
extinct
with
no
small
degree
of
regard
and
affection
it
may
be
that
the
good
folk
and
the
were
so
called
that
good
intention
might
be
compelled
by
the
conjuring
influence
of
a
name
as
well
as
to
avoid
giving
offence
by
uttering
real
names
as
if
it
were
desired
to
exercise
a
magical
influence
by
their
use
be
that
as
it
may
it
is
evident
from
highland
that
the
fairies
were
oftener
the
friends
than
the
foes
of
mankind
when
men
and
women
were
lured
to
their
dwellings
they
rarely
suffered
injury
indeed
the
fairies
appeared
to
have
taken
pleasure
in
their
company
to
such
as
they
favoured
they
imparted
the
secrets
of
their
skill
in
the
arts
of
piping
of
etc
at
sowing
time
or
harvest
they
were
at
the
service
of
human
friends
on
the
needy
they
took
pity
they
never
failed
in
a
promise
they
never
forgot
an
act
of
kindness
which
they
invariably
rewarded
against
those
who
wronged
them
they
took
speedy
vengeance
it
would
appear
that
on
these
humanised
spirits
of
his
conception
the
highlander
left
as
one
would
expect
him
to
do
the
impress
of
his
own
character
his
shrewdness
and
high
sense
of
honour
his
love
of
music
and
gaiety
his
warmth
of
heart
and
love
of
comrades
and
his
indelible
hatred
of
tyranny
and
wrong
the
highland
wee
folk
are
not
so
diminutive
as
the
fairies
of
england
at
least
that
type
of
fairy
beloved
of
the
poet
which
hovers
over
flowers
and
feeds
on
power
they
had
to
shrink
in
stature
and
to
render
themselves
invisible
but
they
are
invariably
little
people
from
three
to
four
feet
high
it
may
be
that
the
conception
of
humanised
spirits
may
not
have
been
uninfluenced
by
the
traditions
of
that
earlier
diminutive
race
whose
of
flint
were
so
long
regarded
as
the
fairies
dwelt
only
in
grassy
knolls
on
the
summits
of
high
hills
and
inside
cliffs
although
capable
of
living
for
several
centuries
they
were
not
immortal
they
required
food
and
borrowed
meal
and
cooking
utensils
from
human
beings
and
always
returned
what
they
received
on
loan
they
could
be
heard
within
the
knolls
grinding
corn
and
working
at
their
anvils
and
they
were
adepts
at
spinning
and
weaving
and
harvesting
when
they
went
on
long
journeys
they
became
invisible
and
were
carried
through
the
air
on
eddies
of
western
wind
at
the
seasonal
changes
of
the
year
the
wee
folk
were
for
several
days
on
end
inspired
like
all
other
supernatural
furies
with
enmity
against
mankind
their
evil
influences
were
negatived
by
spells
and
charms
we
who
still
hang
on
our
walls
at
christmas
the
mystic
holly
are
unconsciously
perpetuating
an
custom
connected
with
belief
in
the
efficacy
of
the
magical
circle
to
protect
us
against
evil
spirits
and
in
our
concern
about
luck
our
proneness
to
believe
in
omens
the
influence
of
colours
and
numbers
in
dreams
and
in
prophetic
warnings
we
retain
as
much
of
the
spirit
as
the
poetry
of
the
religion
of
our
remote
ancestors
the
heroes
the
heroes
with
the
exception
of
cuchullin
who
appear
in
this
volume
figure
in
the
tales
and
poems
of
the
ossianic
or
fian
cycle
which
is
common
to
ireland
and
to
scotland
they
have
been
neglected
by
our
scottish
poets
since
gavin
douglas
and
barbour
in
ireland
the
fians
are
a
band
of
militia
the
original
fenians
in
scotland
the
tales
vary
considerably
and
belong
to
the
hunting
period
before
the
introduction
of
agriculture
but
in
this
country
as
well
as
in
ireland
they
are
evidently
influenced
by
historic
happenings
there
are
tales
of
norse
conflicts
as
well
as
tales
of
adventure
among
giants
and
spirits
the
cycle
had
evidently
remote
beginnings
when
we
find
diarmid
and
grainnè
like
paris
and
helen
the
cause
of
conflict
and
disaster
and
diarmid
like
achilles
charmed
of
body
and
vulnerable
only
on
his
we
incline
to
the
theory
that
from
a
centre
migrating
waves
swept
over
prehistoric
greece
and
left
traces
of
their
mythology
and
in
homer
while
other
waves
sweeping
northward
bequeathed
to
us
as
a
literary
inheritance
the
celtic
in
which
the
deeds
and
magical
attributes
of
remote
tribal
heroes
and
humanised
deities
are
and
perpetuated
on
fragments
of
these
the
poet
macpherson
reared
his
ossianic
epic
in
imitation
of
the
iliad
and
paradise
lost
the
death
of
cuchullin
is
a
rendering
in
verse
of
an
irish
prose
translation
of
a
fragment
of
the
cuchullin
cycle
which
moves
in
the
bronze
age
period
cuchullin
with
the
light
of
heroes
on
his
forehead
is
also
reminiscent
of
achilles
one
of
the
few
cuchullin
tales
found
in
scotland
is
that
which
relates
his
conflict
with
his
son
and
bears
a
striking
similarity
to
the
legend
of
sohrab
and
rustum
macpherson
also
drew
from
this
cycle
in
composing
his
ossian
and
mingled
it
with
the
other
with
which
it
has
no
connection
the
third
great
celtic
cycle
the
arthurian
bears
close
resemblances
as
campbell
of
the
west
highland
tales
has
shown
to
the
fian
cycle
and
had
evidently
a
common
origin
its
value
as
a
source
of
literary
inspiration
has
been
fully
appreciated
but
the
fian
and
cuchullin
cycles
still
await
like
virgin
soil
to
yield
an
abundant
harvest
for
the
poets
of
the
future

with

caught

across

bare
below

broad

on

labouring
in

stared

with
cold
disdain
pondering
he
sat
alone
behind

broad

swallowing
the

as
over
the
hollowing
waves
that
leapt
and
snarled
with
foaming
lips

swept
around

in
querulous
fray

tossed
in

with

like
twisted
bands
drawn
numbly
as
they
rose
outspent
and
staggering
from
their
benches
went
the
sail
napped
quarrelling
and
drank
the
wind
in
broken
gasps
and
sank
with
sullen
pride
upon
the
boards
and
smote
the
mast
and
shook
the
cords
darkly
loomed
that
alien
land
and
darkly
lowered
the
fian
band
for
hovering
on
the
shoreland
grey
the
ship
they
followed
round
the
bay
nor
sought
the
sheltering
woods
until
the
shadows
folded
the
hill
full
heavily
and
night
fell
blind
and
laid
its
spell
upon
the
wind
the
swelling
waters
sank
with
sip
and
hollow
gurgle
round
the
ship
the
long
mast
rocked
against
the
dim
soft
heaven
above
the
headland
rim
but
while
the
seamen
crouched
to
sleep
conn
sat
alone
in
reverie
deep
and
saw
before
him
in
a
maze
the
mute
procession
of
his
days
in
gloom
and
glamour
wending
fast
his
heart
for
the
past
again
he
leapt
a
tender
boy
to
greet
his
sire
with
eager
joy
when
he
came
over
the
wide
north
sea
enriched
with
spoils
of
victory
then
heavily
loomed
that
fateful
morn
when
tidings
of
his
fall
were
borne
from
alban
shore
again
he
saw
the
youth
who
went
alone
with
awe
to
swear
the
avenging
oath
before
the
smoking
altar
red
with
gore
ah
strange
to
him
it
seemed
to
be
that
hour
was
drawing
nigh
when
he
would
vengeance
take
and
still
more
strange
o
sorrow
it
would
bring
no
change
though
blood
for
blood
be
spilled
and
life
for
life
be
taken
in
fierce
strife
recall
the
life
long
sped
or
break
the
silence
of
the
dead
but
when
he
heard
his
mother
wail
once
more
uplifted
on
the
gale
moaning
the
red
who
returned
his
cheeks
with
sudden
passion
burned
and
darkly
frowned
that
valiant
man
as
through
his
quivering
body
ran
the
lightnings
of
impelling
ire
and
impulses
of
fierce
desire
that
surged
with
a
consuming
hate
against
a
world
made
desolate
unceasing
and
unreconciled
and
ever
clamouring
like
wild
waves
that
stun
the
shore
and
through
the
anguished
twilight
roar
the
hungry
passions
of
the
wide
and
gluttonous
deep
unsatisfied
ii
the
shredding
dawn
in
beauty
spread
its
shafts
of
splendour
high
over
the
eastern
heaven
and
broke
through
flaking
clouds
in
silvern
smoke
that
burst
aflame
and
fold
fold
let
loose
their
oozing
floods
of
gold
splashed
over
the
foamless
deep
that
lay
tremulous
and
clear
in
fiery
play
the
rippling
beams
that
swept
between
the
sutor
crags
serene
broke
quivering
where
the
waters
bore
the
soft
reflection
of
the
shore
the
pipes
of
morn
were
sounding
shrill
through
budding
woods
on
plain
and
hill
and
stirred
the
air
with
song
to
wake
the
birds
within
the
brake
the
fians
from
their
sheilings
came
with
offerings
to
the
god
and
round
them
thrice
they
went
then
in
silence
bent
beside
the
pillar
stones
but
now
brave
conn
upon
the
ship
high
prow
hath
raised
his
burnished
blade
on
high
and
calls
on
woden
and
on
tigh
with
boldness
to
avenge
the
death
of
his
great
sire
in
one
deep
breath
he
drains
the
hero
draught
that
burns
with
valour
of
the
gods
then
turns
his
foe
to
meet
great
conn
sweeps
stooping
in
a
boat
alone
shoreward
with
rapid
blades
and
bright
that
shower
the
pearly
white
and
rip
the
waters
bending
lithe
in
hollowing
swirls
that
hiss
and
writhe
like
adders
ere
they
dart
away
with
the
flakes
of
spray
when
furrowing
the
sand
he
drew
his
boat
the
shallowing
water
through
a
giant
he
in
stature
rose
straight
as
a
mast
before
his
foes
with
head
thrown
high
and
shoulders
wide
and
level
and
set
back
with
pride
his
bared
and
supple
arms
were
long
as
shapely
oars
firm
as
a
thong
his
right
hand
grasped
his
gleaming
blade
and
of
keen
bronze
made
in
leafen
shape
with
stately
stride
he
crossed
the
level
sands
and
wide
then
on
his
shield
the
challenge
gave
his
broad
sword
like
a
wave
for
single
combat
red
as
gold
his
locks
upon
his
shoulders
rolled
a
brazen
helmet
on
his
head
flashed
fire
his
cheeks
were
white
and
red
and
all
the
fians
watched
with
awe
that
hero
young
with
knotted
jaw
whose
eyes
set
deep
and
blue
and
hard
surveyed
their
ranks
with
cold
regard
while
his
broad
forehead
seamed
with
care
drooped
shadowily
his
eyebrows
fair
were
sloping
sideways
his
eyes
with
pondering
the
mysteries
the
eyes
of
all
the
fians
sought
heroic
groll
whose
face
was
wrought
with
lines
of
deep
perplexing
thought
for
gazing
on
the
valiant
conn
he
mourned
that
his
own
youth
was
gone
when
strong
and
fierce
and
bold
he
shed
the
of
the
boastful
red
whom
none
save
he
would
meet
he
heard
the
challenge
and
nor
spake
nor
stirred
nor
feared
but
now
grown
old
when
hate
and
lust
of
glory
satiate
his
heart
took
pride
in
conn
and
shared
the
kinship
of
the
brave
who
dared
to
meet
the
viking
bold
if
he
the
succour
of
the
band
should
be
found
faltering
or
in
despair
until
that
day
the
fians
of
one
man
had
such
fear
old
goll
sat
musing
on
a
grassy
knoll
they
deemed
he
shared
their
dread
not
so
wise
finn
who
spake
forth
firm
and
slow

vaunt

why

the
head
of

bold

never

to
be
a
strong
defence
to

thee
upon
his
hard
right
arm
with
haste
his
crooked
and
pointed
shield
he
braced
he
clutched
his
sword
in
his
left
hand
while
round
that
hero
of
the
band
the
fian
warriors
pressed
and
praised
his
valour
mute
was
goll
they
raised
smiting
their
hands
the
to
urge
him
on
to
victory
the
goll
went
forth
alone
his
face
was
like
a
mountain
stone
cold
hard
and
grey
his
breath
came
heavily
like
a
man
nigh
death
but
his
firm
mouth
with
lips
drawn
thin
deep
sunken
in
his
wrinkled
skin
was
cunningly
crooked
his
hair
was
white
on
his
bald
forehead
gleamed
a
bright
and
livid
scar
that
conn
great
sire
had
cloven
when
their
swords
struck
fire
burly
and
dauntless
full
of
might
old
goll
went
humbly
forth
to
fight
with
arrogant
conn
it
seemed
the
red
in
greater
might
was
from
the
dead
restored
in
his
fierce
son
a
deep
swift
silence
fell
like
sudden
sleep
on
all
the
fians
waiting
there
in
sharp
suspense
and
half
despair
the
morn
was
still
a
skylark
hung
in
and
sung
a
lullaby
that
grew
more
sweet
amid
the
stillness
in
the
heat
and
splendour
of
the
sun
the
lisp
of
faint
wind
in
the
herbage
crisp
went
past
them
and
around
the
bare
and
gleaming
fair
the
waves
were
cast
by
the
wan
deep
fatigued
and
vast
o
great
was
conn
in
that
dread
hour
and
all
the
fians
feared
his
power
and
watched
as
in
a
darksome
dream
the
warriors
meet
they
saw
the
gleam
of
swift
swords
and
then
a
breathless
moment
came
as
when
the
lithe
and
living
lightning
flash
makes
pause
until
the
thunder
crash
is
splintered
through
the
air
loud
the
blue
sea
and
the
shining
shore
broke
forth
the
crash
of
arms
the
roll
of
conn
fierce
blows
that
baffled
goll
on
sword
and
shield
resounding
rang
while
that
old
warrior
stooped
and
sprang
sideways
and
swerved
or
backward
leapt
as
swiftly
as
the
bronze
blade
swept
above
him
and
around
he
swayed
stumbling
but
rose
but
though
his
blade
was
ever
nimble
to
defend
the
fians
feared
the
fight
would
end
in
victory
for
was
like
as
when
an
eagle
swoops
to
strike
but
swerves
with
wings
as
nigh
its
head
a
javelin
gleams
a
cry
that
banished
fear
of
conn
great
blows
from
out
the
fian
ranks
arose
as
like
a
plumed
reed
in
a
gust
goll
suddenly
stooped
a
deadly
thrust
that
drew
the
first
blood
in
the
fray
he
darting
gave
with
quick
dismay
the
valiant
conn
drew
back
again
he
leapt
at
goll
but
sought
in
vain
to
blind
him
with
his
blows
that
fell
like
snowflakes
on
a
sullen
well
for
goll
was
calm
while
great
conn
raged
as
hour
by
hour
the
conflict
waged
he
was
a
tree
a
crag
that
spurned
a
furious
sea
and
all
the
fians
with
one
mind
set
firm
their
faith
in
goll
the
wind
rose
like
a
startled
bird
from
out
the
heather
at
the
huntsman
shout
in
swift
and
flight
at
noon
the
sun
rolled
in
a
cloudy
swoon
dimly
and
over
the
rolling
deep
gust
followed
gust
with
shadowy
sweep
and
waves
that
streamed
their
snowy
locks
were
tossing
high
against
the
rocks
seaward
while
round
the
sands
ebbed
wide
scrambled
the
fierce
devouring
tide
o
conn
was
like
a
hound
at
morn
that
springs
upon
an
elk
forlorn
among
the
hills
he
was
a
proud
cascade
that
leaps
a
cliff
with
loud
unspending
fall
so
fierce
so
fair
was
arrogant
conn
but
goll
fought
there
with
ready
guard
at

he
was
as
a
boar
in
that
fierce
fray
the
waves
were
humbled
on
the
shore
and
silent
fell
amid
the
roar
and
crash
of
battle
mute
and
still
the
fians
watched
while
on
the
hill
the
little
elves
came
out
and
gazed
to
be
amused
and
were
amazed
they
saw
upon
the
shrinking
sands
the
warriors
with
restless
hands
and
busy
blades
with
shields
that
rose
to
buffet
the
unceasing
blows
they
saw
before
the
rising
flood
the
flash
of
fire
the
flash
of
blood
and
watched
the
men
with
panting
breath
striving
to
be
the
slaves
of
death
now
darting
wide
now
swerving
round
now
clashed
together
in
a
bound
with
splitting
swords
that
smote
so
fast
as
hour
by
hour
unheeded
past
the
sands
were
torn
and
tossed
like
spray
before
the
whirlwind
of
the
fray
that
waged
in
fury
till
the
sun
sank
and
the
day
last
loops
were
spun
then
terrible
was
goll
he
rose
a
tempest
of
increasing
blows
more
furious
and
fast
as

his

swept
like

be
forgetting
of
the
thing
that
came
with
me
for
it
was
big
and
black
as
black
and
it
was
dour
as
dour
it
shrank
and
grew
and
had
no
shape
of
aught
i
did
see
for
it
came
creeping
like
a
cloud
that
moving
all
alone
without
the
sound
of
footsteps
and
i
heard
its
heavy
sighs
its
face
was
old
and
grey
and
like
a
stone
and
its
tangled
locks
were
dropping
its
sad
and
weary
eyes
o
it
never
the
word
it
had
to
say
in
anger
or
in
woe
it
would
not
seek
to
harm
me
that
had
never
done
it
wrong
as
fleet
o
like
the
deer
i
went
or
i
went
panting
slow
the
waesome
thing
came
with
me
on
that
lonely
road
and
long
o
eerie
was
the
urisk
that
convoy
me
the
moor
when
i
was
all
so
helpless
and
my
heart
was
full
of
fear
nor
when
it
was
beside
me
or
behind
me
was
i
sure
i
knew
it
would
be

it
would

kisses
hot
and
sweet
there
a
lost
and
languished
lover
with
a
fierce
and
jealous
eye
as
merrily
flit
the
nimble
folk
across
the
northern
sky
so
now
the
dance
is
over
and
the
dancers
sink
to
rest
there
a
maid
that
has
two
lovers
and
there
one
she
loves
the
best
he
will
cast
him
down
before
her
she
will
raise
him
with
a
sigh
her
love
so
bright
who
danced
across
the
northern
sky
then
up
will
leap
the
other
and
up
will
leap
his
clan
o
the
lover
and
his
company
will
fight
them
man
to
man
all
shrieking
from
the
conflict
the
merry
maidens
fly
there
a
battle
royal
raging
now
across
the
northern
sky
through
all
the
hours
of
darkness
the
fearsome
fight
will
last
they
are
leaping
white
with
anger
and
the
blows
are
falling
fast
and
where
the
slain
have
tumbled
a
pool
of
blood
will
lie
o
it
dripping
on
the
dark
green
stones
from
out
the
northern
sky
when
yon
lady
seeks
her
lover
in
the
cold
and
pearly
morn
she
will
find
that
he
has
fallen
by
the
hand
that
she
would
scorn
she
will
clasp
her
arms
about
him
and
in
her
anguish
die
o
never
again
will
trip
the
twain
across
the
northern
sky
my
gunna
when
my
kine
are
on
the
hill
who
will
charm
them
from
all
ill
while
i
sleep
at
ease
until
all
the
cocks
are
crowing
clear
who
be
herding
them
for
me
it
the
elf
i
fain
would
see
for
they
safe
as
safe
can
be
when
the
gunna
will
be
near
he
will
watch
the
long
weird
night
when
the
stars
will
shake
with
fright
or
the
ghostly
moon
leaps
bright
the
ben
like
beltane
fire
if
my
kine
would
seek
the
corn
he
will
turn
them
by
the
horn
and
i
find
them
all
at
morn
lowing
sweet
beside
the
byre

and
he
moan
the
gunna

when
the
frosts
are
flickering
white
and
the
kine

perched
alone
on
a
chilly

grey
stone

bone

yon
fairy
dog
was
bold
maccodrum
of
the
seals
whose
heart
would
never
fail
would
hear
yon
fairy
fierce
come
howling
down
the
gale
the
of
the
paws
would
sound
like
horse
hoofs
on
frozen
ground
while
its
back
and
curling
round
uprose
its
fearsome
tail
was
bold
maccodrum
of
the

man
that
hath
no
fears
beheld
the
dog
with
back
that
bends
not

than
the
night
but
underneath
the
hair
was
white
its

were
yellow
its
eyes
were
bright
and
were
its

bold
maccodrum
of

naught

stooping
with

head

cried
he
ere
i
be
lost
for
every
living
thing
that
its
path
would
tumble
dead
was
bold
maccodrum
of
the
seals
the
man
who
took
fright
would
watch
it
bounding
from
the
hills
and
the
moors
in
flight
when
it
would
leave
the
uist
shore
across
the
minch
he
heard
it
roar
like
yon
black
cloud
it
bounded
the
coolin
hills
that
night
the
o
the
will
come
over
the
heath
with
the
foaming
mouth
and
the
flashing
eyes
he
black
above
and
he
white
beneath
the
hills
are
hearing
the
awesome
cries
the
sand
lies
thick
in
his
dripping
hair
and
his
hoofs
are
twined
with
weeds
and
ware
alas
for
the
man
who
would
clutch
the
mane
there
no
spell
to
help
and
no
charm
to
save
who
rides
him
will
never

again
were
he

strong
o

he
as
brave
as
of
whom
they

he
thrashed
the
devil
and
made
him
yell
he
gallop
so
fierce
he
gallop
so
fast
so
high
he
rear
and
so
swift
he
bound
like
the
lightning
flash
he
go
prancing
past
like
the
will
his
hoofs
resound
and
the
man
perchance
who
sees
and
hears
he
would
blind
his
eyes
he
would
close
his
ears
the
horse
will
bellow
the
horse
will
snort
and
the
gasping
rider
will
pant
for
breath
let
the
way
be
long
or
the
way
be
short
it
will
have
one
end
and
the
end
is
death
in
yon
black
loch
from
off
the
shore
the
horse
will
splash
and
be
seen
no
more
the
changeling
by
night
they
came
and
from
my
bed
they
stole
my
babe
and
left
behind
a
thing
i
hate
a
thing
i
dread
a
changeling

is
old
and
blind

moaning
all
the
night
and
day
for
those
who
took
my
babe
away
my
little
babe
was
sweet
and
fair
he
crooned
to
sleep
upon
my
breast
but
o
the
burden
i
must
bear
this
drinks
all
day
and
will
not
rest
my
little
babe
had
hair
so
light
and
his
is
growing
dark
as
night
yon
evil
day
when
i
would
leave
my
little
babe
the
stook
behind
the
fairies
coming
home
at
eve
upon
an
eddy
of
the
wind

cast
their
eyes
with
envy
deep
upon
my
in
his
sleep

holy
woman
will
ye
find
to
weave
a
spell
and

a
charm

and
kind

the
fians
of
knockfarrel
a
legend
i
on
steep
knockfarrel
had
the
fians
made
for
safe
retreat
a
high
and
strong
stockade
around
their
dwellings
and
when
winter
fell
and
strathpeffer
laid
its
barren
spell
when
days
were
bleak
with
storm
and
nights
were
drear
and
dark
and
lonesome
well
they
loved
to
hear
the
songs
of
ossian
peerless
and
sublime
their
blind
grey
bard
grown
old
before
his
time
lamenting
for
his
son
the
young
the
brave
oscar
who
fell
beside
the
western
wave
in
gavra
bloody
and
unequal
fight
round
ossian
would
they
gather
in
the
night
beseeching
him
for
song
and
when
he
took
his
clarsach
from
the
magic
strings
he
shook
a
maze
of
trembling
music
falling
sweet
as
mossy
waters
in
the
summer
heat
and
soft
as
fainting
when
they
leave
the
fume
of
myrtle
on
a
dewy
eve
bound
flush
and
teeming
tarns
that
all
night
hear
low
elfin
pipings
in
the
woodlands
near
was
thus
he
sang
of
love
and
in
a
dream
the
fair
maids
sighed
to
hear
but
when
his
theme
was
the
long
chase
that
finn
and
all
his
men
followed
with
lightsome
heart
from
glen
to
glen
his
song
was
free
as
morn
and
clear
and
loud
as
skylarks
carolling
below
a
cloud
in
sweet
june
weather
and
they
heard
the
fall
of
mountain
streams
the
huntsman
windy
call
across
the
heaving
hills
the
baying
hound
among
the
rocks
while
echoes
answered
round
they
heard
and
shared
the
gladness
of
the
chase
he
sang
the
glories
of
the
fian
race
whose
fame
is
flashed
through
alba
far
and
wide
their
valorous
deeds
he
sang
with
joy
and
pride
when
their
dark
foemen
from
the
west
came
the
ragged
hills
and
when
on
croumba
shore
the
viking
hordes
descending
fought
and
fled
and
when
brave
conn
who
would
avenge
the
red
by
goll
was
slain
of
finn
he
sang
and
dermaid
while
the
clash
of
conflict
rang
in
billowy
music
through
the
heroes
hall
and
many
a
fian
gave
the
when
ossian
sang
haggard
and
old
with
slow
and
steps
went
winter
through
the
snow
as
if
its
dreary
round
would
be
done
the
last
long
winter
of
their
days
begun
ere
yet
the
latest
flush
of
falling
leaves
had
faded
in
the
breath
of
chilling
eves
nor
ended
in
the
days
of
longer
light
when
dawn
and
eve
encroached
upon
the
night
a
weary
time
it
was
the
long
strath
lay
and
pathless
and
from
day
to
day
the
tempests
raved
across
the
skies
and
they
grew
weak
and
pale
with
hollow
eyes
the
while
their
stores
shrank
low
waiting
the
dawn
of
that
sweet
season
when
through
woodlands
wan
fresh
flowers
flutter
and
the
wild
birds
sing
for
winter
on
the
forelock
of
the
spring
its
icy
fingers
laid
the
huntsmen
pined
in
their
dim
dwellings
wearily
confined
while
the
loud
hungry
tempest
held
its
sway
the
wolves
grew
bold
and
came
by
day
and
birds
fell
frozen
in
the
snow
then
through
the
trackless
strath
a
balmy
south
wind
blew
to
usher
lusty
spring
lo
in
a
night
the
snows
shrinking
upon
plain
and
height
and
morning
broke
in
brightness
to
the
sound
of
falling
waters
while
a
peace
profound
possessed
the
world
around
them
and
the
blue
bared
heaven
above
then
all
the
fians
knew
that
winter
spell
was
broken
and
each
one
made
glad
obeisance
to
the
golden
sun
three
days
around
knockfarrel
they
pursued
the
chase
across
the
hills
and
through
the
wood
round
ussie
loch
and
dingwall
soundless
shore
but
meagre
were
the
burdens
that
they
bore
at
even
to
their
dwellings
to
the
west
but
sorrow
not
said
finn
when
all
they
hastened
on
a
drear
and
bootless
quest
with
weary
steps
they
turned
to
their
stockade
will
we
hunt
towards
the
east
to
high
dunskaith
and
then
make
gladsome
feast
by
night
when
we
return
or
ever
morn
had
broken
finn
arose
and
on
his
horn
blew
loud
the
huntsman
blast
that
round
the
ben
was
echoed
and
then
all
his
men
gathered
about
him
in
the
dusk
nor
knew
what
dim
forebodings
filled
his
heart
and
drew
his
brows
in
furrowed
care
his
eyes
still
stared
upon
the
horrors
of
a
dream
of
evil
omen
that
in
vain
he
sought
to
solve
his
voice
came
faint
from
battling
thought
as
he
to
garry
spake
be
thou
the
ward
strong
son
of
morna
who
like
thee
can
guard
our
women
from
all
peril
garry
turned
from
finn
in
sullen
silence
for
he
yearned
to
join
the
chase
once
more
in
stature
he
was
least
of
all
the
tribe
but
none
could
be
more
fierce
in
conflict
fighting
in
the
van
than
that
grim
wolfish
and
misshapen
man
then
finn
to
caoilte
spake
and
gave
command
to
hasten
forth
before
the
fian
band
the
king
of
scouts
was
he
and
like
the
deer
he
sped
to
find
if
foemen
had
come
near
fierce
swarthy
hillmen
waiting
at
the
fords
for
combat
eager
or
red
viking
hordes
from
out
the
northern
isles
in
alba
wide
no
runner
could
keep
pace
by
caoilte
side
and
ere
the
fians
following
in
his
path
had
wended
from
the
deep
and
dusky
strath
he
swept
clyne
and
heard
the
awesome
owls
that
hoot
afar
and
near
in
woody
foulis
and
he
had
reached
the
slopes
of
fair
rosskeen
ere
finn
by
fyrish
came
the
dawn
broke
green
for
the
high
huntsman
of
the
morn
had
flung
his
mantle
his
back
stooping
he
strung
his
silver
bow
then
rising
bright
and
bold
he
shot
a
burning
arrow
of
pure
gold
that
rent
the
heart
of
night
as
far
behind
the
fians
followed
caoilte
like
the
wind
sped
on
yon
son
of
ronan
the
wide
and
marshy
moor
and
the
mountain
side
by
delny
shore
and
wan
and
brown
and
through
the
woods
of
beautous
balnagown
the
roaring
streams
he
vaulted
on
his
spear
and
foaming
torrents
leapt
as
he
drew
near
the
sandy
slopes
of
nigg
he
climbed
and
ran
till
high
above
dunskaith
he
stood
to
scan
the
outer
ocean
for
the
viking
ships
peering
below
his
hand
with
panting
lips
but
wide
and
empty
lay
the
sea
beyond
the
barrier
crags
of
cromarty
to
the
far
lying
blue
and
bare
for
no
red
pirate
sought
as
yet
to
dare
the
gloomy
hazards
of
the
fitful
seas
the
gusty
terrors
and
the
treacheries
of
fickle
april
and
its
changing
skies
and
while
he
scanned
the
waves
with
curious
eyes
the
in
his
nostrils
who
had
spent
a
long
bleak
winter
in
knockfarrel
pent
over
the
strath
and
buried
wood
a
sense
of
freedom
tingled
in
his
blood
the
large
life
of
the
ocean
heaving
wide
his
heart
possessed
with
gladness
and
with
pride
and
he
rejoiced
to
be
alive
once
more
he
heard
the
drenching
waves
on
that
rough
shore
raking
the
shingles
and
the
rocks
sucking
the
brine
through
bared
and
lapping
locks
of
bright
brown
tangle
while
the
shelving
ledges
poured
back
the
swirling
waters
their
edges
and
billows
breaking
on
a
precipice
in
spouts
of
spray
fell
spreading
like
a
fleece
sullen
and
sunken
lay
the
reef
with
sleek
and
foaming
lips
before
the
flooded
creek
with
arrowy
weed
its
green
expanse
and
translucent
a
bright
trance
of
splendour
lay
athwart
the
wide
blue
ocean
swept
with
loops
of
silvern
tide
heavily
heaving
in
a
long
slow
swell
a
lonely
fisher
in
his
coracle
came
round
a
headland
lifted
on
a
wave
that
bore
him
through
the
shallows
to
his
cave
nor
other
being
he
saw
the
birds
that
flew
clamorous
about
the
cliffs
and
diving
drew
their
prey
from
bounteous
waters
on
him
cast
cold
beady
eyes
of
wonder
wheeling
past
and
sliding
down
the
wind
ii
the
warm
sun
shone
on
blind
grey
ossian
musing
all
alone
upon
a
knoll
before
the
high
stockade
when
oscar
son
came
nigh
his
hand
he
laid
on
the
boy
curls
and
then
his
fingers
strayed
over
the
face
and
round
the
tender
chin
be
thou
as
brave
as
oscar
wise
as
finn
said
ossian
with
a
sigh
nay
i
would
be
a
bard
the
boy
made
answer
like
to
thee
alas
my
son
the
gentle
ossian
said
my
song
was
born
in
sorrow
for
the
dead
o
may
such
grief
as
ossian
be
thine
if
thou
sing
may
thou
below
the
pine
murmuring
thy
dreams
conceive
and
happy
be
nor
hear
but
sorrow
in
the
breaking
sea
and
in
the
gale
alas
my
song
that
rose
in
sorrow
must
survive
in
wrong
my
life
is
spent
and
vain
a
day
of
thine
were
better
than
a
long
dark
year
of
mine
but
come
my
son
so
lead
me
by
the
hand
to
hear
the
sweetest
harper
in
the
land
the
wild
free
wind
of
spring
all
the
hills
and
under
let
us
go
by
tuneful
rills
we
wander
and
my
heart
shall
sweetened
be
with
echoes
of
the
moorland
melody
my
clarsach
wilt
thou
bear
and
so
went
they
together
from
knockfarrel
long
they
lay
within
the
woods
of
brahan
and
by
the
shore
of
silvery
conon
wended
crossing
the
ford
at
achilty
where
ossian
told
the
tale
of
finn
who
there
had
slain
the
bold
black
arky
in
his
youth
and
ere
the
tale
was
ended
they
had
crossed
to
tarradale
where
dwelt
a
daughter
of
an
ancient
race
in
lore
and
with
the
gift
to
trace
the
thread
of
life
in
the
dark
web
of
fate
and
she
to
ossian
cried
thou
comest
late
too
late
alas
this
day
of
all
dark
days
knockfarrel
is
before
me
all
ablaze
a
fearsome
vision
flaming
to
mine
eyes
o
beating
heart
that
bleeds
i
hear
the
cries
of
those
that
perish
in
yon
high
stockade
o
many
a
tender
lad
and
lonesome
maid
sweet
wife
and
sleeping
babe
and
hero
old
o
ossian
thou
see
o
child
behold
yon
ruddy
closing
clouds
so
falls
the
fate
of
all
the
tribe
alas
thou
comest
late
iii
when
ossian
from
knockfarrel
went
a
band
of
merry
maidens
trooping
hand
in
hand
came
forth
with
laughing
eyes
and
flowing
hair
to
share
the
freedom
of
the
morning
air
adown
the
steep
they
went
and
through
the
wood
where
garry
splintered
logs
in
sullen
mood
pining
to
join
the
chase
his
wrath
he
wrought
upon
the
trees
that
morn
as
if
he
fought
against
a
hundred
foemen
from
the
west
till
he
grew
weary
and
was
fain
to
rest
the
maids
were
wont
to
shower
upon
his
head
their
merry
taunts
and
oft
from
them
he
fled
for
of
their
quips
and
jests
he
had
more
fear
than
he
felt
before
a
foeman
spear
and
so
he
chose
to
be
alone
the
air
was
heavily
laden
with
the
odour
rare
of
deep
fir
trees
breathing
sweet
as
through
the
wood
the
maids
with
silent
feet
went
treading
needled
sward
in
light
and
shade
now
bright
now
dim
like
that
gleam
and
fade
and
ever
bloom
and
ever
pass
away
upon
a
fairy
hillock
garry
lay
in
sunshine
fast
asleep
his
head
was
bare
and
the
wind
rippling
through
his
golden
hair
laid
out
the
seven
locks
that
were
his
pride
which
one
by
one
the
maids
securely
tied
to
while
garry
breathing
deep
moaned
low
and
moved
about
in
troubled
sleep
then
to
a
thicket
all
the
maidens
crept
and
raised
the
call
of
warning
garry
leapt
from
dreams
that
boded
ill
with
sudden
fear
that
a
fierce
band
of
foemen
had
come
near
the
seven
fetters
of
his
golden
hair
he
wrenched
off
as
he
leapt
and
so
laid
bare
a
shredded
scalp
of
ruddy
wounds
that
bled
with
bitter
agony
the
maidens
fled
with
laughter
through
the
wood
and
climb
the
path
of
steep
knockfarrel
fierce
was
garry
wrath
when
he
perceived
who
wronged
him
with
a
shriek
that
raised
the
eagles
from
the
mountain
peak
he
shook
his
spear
and
ran
with
stumbling
feet
and
sought
for
vengeance
speedy
and
complete
the
lust
of
blood
possessed
him
and
he
swore
to
slay
them
but
they
shut
the
oaken
door
ere
he
had
reached
that
high
and
strong
stockade
from
whence
alas
nor
wife
nor
child
nor
maid
came
forth
again
iv
upon
a
bank
lay
caoilte
on
the
while
he
drank
the
sweetness
of
the
morning
air
that
brought
a
spell
of
dreamful
ease
and
pleasant
thought
with
from
the
deeps
of
other
years
when
dermaid
unforgotten
by
his
peers
and
oscar
fair
and
young
went
forth
with
mirth
the
hills
around
the
firth
on
such
an
april
morn
he
leapt
to
hear
the
fians
shouting
from
a
woodland
near
their
then
swift
he
sped
with
bounding
heart
to
join
the
gladsome
chase
stooping
he
ran
with
poised
uplifted
spear
as
through
the
woods
approached
the
nimble
deer
that
swerved
beholding
him
with
startled
toss
of
antlers
down
the
slope
it
fled
to
cross
the
open
vale
before
him
to
the
west
the
fians
merging
from
the
woodland
pressed
to
head
it
shoreward
all
the
fierce
hounds
bayed
with
hungry
ardour
and
the
deer
dismayed
with
foaming
nostrils
leapt
and
strove
to
flee
towards
the
deep
dark
woods
of
calrossie
but
caoilte
fresh
from
resting
was
more
fleet
than
deer
or
dogs
and
sped
with
naked
feet
until
upon
a
loose
and
sandy
bank
plunging
his
spear
into
the
smoking
flank
its
flight
he
stayed
he
stabbed
it
as
it
sank
the
spurting
and
he
saw
it
die
or
ever
dog
or
huntsman
had
come
nigh
then
eager
feast
they
made
and
after
long
and
frequent
fast
of
winter
they
grew
strong
as
they
had
been
of
old
and
of
their
fare
the
lean
and
scrambling
hounds
had
ready
share
nor
they
in
their
merry
mood
but
set
to
hunt
again
and
through
the
wood
scattered
with
eager
pace
ere
yet
the
sun
had
climbed
to
highest
noon
for
lo
each
one
had
of
the
famished
cheeks
and
white
of
those
who
waited
their
return
by
night
in
steep
knockfarrel
desolate
stockade
o
many
a
beauteous
and
bethrothèd
maid
and
mothers
nursing
babes
and
warriors
lying
in
spell
the
old
men
dying
and
slim
fair
lads
who
waited
to
acclaim
with
gladsome
shout
the
huntsmen
when
they
came
with
burdens
of
the
chase
so
they
pursued
the
hunt
till
eve
was
nigh
in
geanies
wood
another
deer
they
slew
caoilte
who
stood
on
a
high
ridge
alone
with
eager
eyes
scanning
the
prospect
wide
in
mute
surprise
saw
rising
knockfarrel
a
dark
cloud
of
thick
and
writhing
smoke
then
fierce
and
loud
upon
his
horn
he
blew
the
warning
blast
from
out
the
woods
the
fians
hastened
fast
lo
when
they
stared
towards
the
western
sky
they
saw
their
winter
dwelling
blazing
high
then
fear
possessed
them
for
their
own
and
grief
unutterable
and
thus
spake
their
wise
chief
to
whom
came
knowledge
and
the
swift
sure
thought
alas
alas
an
enemy
hath
wrought
black
vengeance
on
our
kind
in
yonder
gleam
of
fearsome
flame
the
horrors
of
my
dream
are
now
accomplished
all
we
loved
and
cherished
and
sought
and
fought
for
in
that
pyre
have
perished
they
heard
then
wailing
loud
they
ran
following
the
nimble
caoilte
man
by
man
towards
knockfarrel
leaping
on
their
spears
marsh
and
stream
macreithin
blind
with
tears
tumbled
or
leapt
into
a
swollen
flood
that
swept
him
to
the
sea
but
no
man
stood
to
help
or
mourn
him
for
the
eve
grew
dim
and
some
there
were
indeed
who
envied
him
as
snarls
the
wolf
at
bay
within
the
wood
on
huntsmen
and
their
hounds
so
garry
stood
raging
before
the
women
who
had
made
secure
retreat
within
the
high
stockade
he
cursed
them
all
and
their
loud
laughter
rang
more
bitter
to
his
heart
than
the
pang
of
his
fierce
wounds
then
while
his
streaming
blood
him
he
hastened
to
the
wood
and
a
small
tree
upon
his
shoulders
bore
and
fixed
it
fast
against
the
oaken
door
that
none
might
issue
forth
then
once
again
towards
the
wood
he
turned
but
all
in
vain
the
women
waited
his
return
till
they
grey
for
in
pain
and
wrath
he
lay
in
a
close
thicket
brooding
his
shame
and
panting
for
revenge
then
finn
wife
came
to
set
the
women
to
the
wheel
and
loom
with
angry
chiding
and
a
heavy
gloom
fell
on
them
all
who
knoweth
thus
she
spake
what
evil
may
the
fian
men
this
day
of
evil
omens
i
say
the
pale
ghost
of
my
sire
with
white
and
trembling
lips
at
morn
before
my
sight
a
raven
darted
from
the
wood
and
slew
a
brooding
dove
what
fear
is
mine
for
who
would
us
defend
if
our
fierce
foemen
came
when
garry
is
against
us
much
i
blame
thy
wanton
deed
the
women
heard
in
shame
nor
answer
made
the
sun
with
fiery
gleam
scattered
the
clouds
as
in
a
dream
the
spirits
of
the
dead
are
softly
swept
from
severed
visions
sweet
a
low
wind
crept
around
with
steps
and
pausing
sighed
then
fled
to
murmur
from
the
mountain
side
amid
the
shade
while
all
aglow
bared
a
crest
of
shining
snow
in
barren
splendour
the
slumbering
strath
while
some
sat
trembling
fearing
garry
wrath
some
feared
the
coming
of
the
foe
and
some
had
vague
forebodings
and
were
brooding
dumb
and
longed
to
greet
the
huntsmen
mothers
laid
their
babes
to
sleep
and
many
a
gentle
maid
sighed
for
her
lover
in
that
lone
stockade
and
one
who
sat
apart
with
pensive
eye
thus
sang
to
hear
the
peewee
plaintive
cry
peewee
crying
sweet
crying
early
crying
late
will
your
voice
be
never
weary
crying
for
your
mate
other
hearts
than
thine
are
lonely
other
hearts
must
wait
peewee
peewee
i
be
flying
the
hills
and
the
sea
till
i
found
the
love
i
long
for
he
be
peewee
crying
i
be
flying
could
i
fly
like
thee
when
garry
who
had
stanched
his
wounds
arose
he
seized
his
axe
and
with
rapid
blows
to
fell
down
fir
trees
through
the
silent
strath
the
hollow
echoes
rang
with
fiendish
wrath
he
made
resolve
to
heap
the
splintered
wood
against
the
door
and
burn
the
hated
brood
of
his
tormentors
one
and
all
he
hewed
an
ample
pyre
then
piled
it
thick
and
high
while
the
sun
sloping
to
the
western
sky
proclaimed
the
closing
of
that
fateful
day
but
the
doomed
women
little
dreamed
that
they
would
have
such
fearsome
end
as
garry
lay
rubbing
the
firesticks
till
they
to
glow
he
heard
a
fian
mother
singing
low
o
sleep
i
sing
to
thee
moolachie
o
moolachie
sleep
o
sleep
like
yon
grey
stone
moolachie
mine
own
sleep
o
sleep
nor
sigh
nor
fret
ye
and
the
goblins
will
not
get
ye
i
will
shield
ye
i
will
pet
ye
moolachie
mine
the
mother
sang
the
gentle
babe
made
moan
and
garry
heard
them
with
a
heart
of
stone
with
fiendish
laugh
he
saw
the
leaping
flames
possess
the
pyre
he
heard
the
shrieking
dames
and
maids
and
children
wailing
in
the
gloom
of
smothering
smoke
they
had
met
their
doom
then
when
the
high
stockade
was
blazing
red
ere
yet
their
cries
were
silenced
garry
fled
and
westward
the
shouldering
hills
he
sped
vi
a
broad
faint
twilight
lingered
to
unfold
the
sun
beams
of
tangled
gold
and
the
long
billowy
hills
in
gathering
shade
their
naked
peaks
and
ebon
crags
displayed
against
the
tender
heaven
and
pale
and
misty
shadows
gathered
in
the
vale
when
caoilte
to
knockfarrel
came
and
saw
amid
the
dusk
with
sorrow
and
with
awe
the
ruins
of
their
winter
dwelling
laid
in
smouldering
ashes
while
the
high
stockade
around
the
rocky
wall
like
ragged
teeth
was
crackling
the
melting
stones
beneath
still
darting
flame
and
flickering
in
the
breeze
he
sped
towards
the
wood
and
through
the
trees
called
loud
for
those
who
perished
on
his
fair
and
gentle
spouse
he
called
in
his
despair
his
sweet
son
and
his
sire
whose
hair
was
white
as
wyvis
snow
he
called
for
in
the
night
full
loud
and
long
across
the
strath
he
cried
the
echoes
mocked
him
from
the
mountain
side
ah
when
his
last
hope
faded
like
the
wave
of
twilight
ebbing
the
hills
he
gave
his
heart
to
utter
grief
and
deep
despair
and
the
cold
stars
peer
down
with
pitiless
stare
while
sank
the
wind
in
silence
on
its
flight
through
the
dark
hollows
of
the
spacious
night
and
distant
sounds
seem
near
in
his
dismay
he
heard
a
fian
calling
far
away
the
answered
back
with
dismal
cry
like
to
a
wounded
man
about
to
die
but
caoilte
lips
were
silent
once
again
and
nearer
came
the
voice
that
cried
in
vain
then
swift
steps
climbed
knockfarrel
barren
steep
and
alvin
called
with
trembling
voice
and
deep
to
caoilte
crouching
low
with
bended
head
who
liveth
i
am
here
alone
he
said
thus
fian
after
fian
came
to
share
their
bitter
grief
in
silence
and
despair
all
night
they
kept
lone
watch
until
the
dawn
with
stealthy
fingers
the
east
had
drawn
its
dewy
veil
and
dim
then
finn
arose
from
deep
and
sleepless
brooding
his
woes
and
spake
unto
the
fians
who
shall
rest
while
flees
our
evil
foeman
farther
west
arise
but
who
hath
done
this
deed
they
sighed
and
finn
made
answer
garry
then
they
cried
for
vengeance
swift
and
terrible
and
leapt
to
answer
finn
command
a
cold
wind
swept
from
out
the
gates
of
morning
moaning
loud
as
swift
they
hastened
forth
a
ragged
shroud
of
gathering
tempest
cast
a
sudden
gloom
and
round
it
falling
fast
it
drifted
the
darkened
slopes
and
bare
and
swirled
in
the
chill
morning
air
then
the
sea
the
sun
leapt
large
and
bright
the
storm
and
moor
and
crag
lay
white
as
westward
the
hills
the
fians
all
in
quest
of
garry
sped
at
they
found
him
on
the
bald
and
rocky
side
of
steep
garry
lay
to
hide
within
a
cave
which
backward
the
snow
he
entered
that
his
steps
might
seem
to
show
he
had
fled
eastward
by
the
path
he
came
all
day
he
sought
to
flee
them
in
his
shame
watching
from
lofty
crag
or
deep
ravine
and
crouching
in
the
heath
with
haggard
mien
he
sought
in
vain
to
hide
till
darkness
cast
its
blinding
cloak
betwixt
them
when
at
last
finn
cried
come
forth
thou
dog
of
evil
deeds
nor
respite
seek
his
limbs
like
reeds
trembled
and
bent
beneath
him
so
he
rose
and
came
to
meet
his
friends
who
were
his
foes
then
unto
finn
he
spake
with
accents
meek
one
last
request
i
of
the
fians
seek
whom
i
have
loved
in
peace
and
served
in
strife
is
thine
said
finn
but
ask
not
for
thy
life
for
thou
art
the
fians
i
would
die
said
garry
with
my
head
laid
on
thy
thigh
and
let
young
alvin
take
thy
sword
that
he
may
give
the
death
that
will
mine
honour
be
was
so
he
lay
to
die
but
as
the
blade
swept
bright
young
alvin
keen
for
vengeance
swayed
and
slipped
upon
the
sward
and
his
fierce
blow
that
garry
slew
the
fian
chief
laid
low
a
grievous
wound
was
gaping
on
his
thigh
and
poured
his
forth
a
low
weird
cry
the
great
finn
gave
as
he
fell
back
and
swooned
in
vain
they
strove
to
stanch
the
fearsome
wound
his
life
ebbed
slowly
with
the
sun
last
ray
in
gathering
gloom
and
when
in
death
he
lay
the
glory
of
the
fians
passed
away
her
evil
eye
o
mairi
dhu
the

come

woke
from
dreams
forewarning
death
and
cold
and
awesome
came
the
cry
an
evil
omen
the
magician
saith
a
low
gust
panted
like
a
man
last
breath
as
morning
crept
into
the
chamber
black
then
all
his
weapons
clashed
and
tumbled
from
the
rack
for
the
last
time
his
evil
foemen
came
the
sons
of
calatin
by
lugaid
led
the
land
lay
smouldering
with
smoke
and
flame
the
duns
were
fallen
and
the
fords
ran
red
and
widows
fled
lamenting
for
their
dead
to
fair
emania
on
that
fateful
day
where
all
forsworn
with
fighting
great
cuchullin
lay
levarchan
whom
he
loved
a
maid
most
fair
with
yellow
hair
and
eyes
the
evil
tidings
to
cuchullin
bare
and
trembling
in
her
beauty
bade
him
rise
niamh
brave
conal
queen
the
old
the
wise
urged
him
with
clamour
of
the
land
alarms
and
stirr
with
vengeful
might
the
hero
sprang
to
arms
his
purple
mantle
his
shoulders
wide
in
haste
he
flung
and
them
stood
all
scarr
and
terrible
in
battle
pride
his
brooch
that
clasp
his
mantle
and
his
hood
then
fell
his
foot
to
pierce
and
his
red
blood
follow
like
fate
behind
him
as
he
levarchan
shriek
and
niamh
moaned
his
doom
and
wept
thus
sallying
forth
he
called
his
charioteer
and
bade
him
yoke
the
of
his
choice
the
grey
of
macha
shuddering
in
fear
had
scented
death
and
pranced
with
fearsome
noise
but
when
it
heard
cuchullin
chiding
voice
meekly
it
sought
the
chariot
to
be
bound
and
wept
big
tears
of
blood
before
him
on
the
ground
then
to
his
chariot
leapt
the
lord
of
war
leave
me
not
levarchan
cried
in
woe
thrice
fifty
queens
who
gather
from
afar
moan
with
one
voice
thou
from
us
go
they
smote
their
hands
and
fast
their
tears
did
flow

thunder
the
plain
full
well

knew
that
he
would
return
again
how
vehement
and
how
beautiful
they
swept
the
grey
of
macha
and
the
black
most
bold
and
laegh
the
watchful
and
adept
nor
turn
nor
spake
as
on

steeds
he
urged

red
goad

impatient
for
the
fray
his
golden
hilted
bronze
sword
on

thigh

sharp
and
venomous
dart
beside

lay
he
clasp
his
ashen
spear

high
as

the
sun
upon
the
western
sky
his
round
shield
from
afar
was
flashing
bright
figured
with
radiant
gold

stood
his
great
broad
head
thrown
back
the
white
pearls
sprayed
upon
his
thick
dark
hair
deep
set
his
eyes
beneath

and
grey

his
fearless
stare
his
white
hood
flamed

tunic
rare
of

with

for

with

cook
a

of

a

thee
loud
mid

the

roll
round

fuad
desolate
and
grand
till
ere
with
hate
the
hero
did
behold
to
sweep
the
foemen
from
the
land
his
sword
flash
red
and
radiant
in
his
hand
in
sunny
splendour
was
his
spear
upraised
and
hovering
his

the
light
of

blazed

cried
ere
as

shook
with
fear
link
thy
shields
and
close
together
throng
and
shout
the
loud
and
fierce
and
long
then
ere
with
cunning
of
his
evil
heart
set
heroes
forth
in
pairs
to
feign
to
fight
apart
as
furious
tempests
that
in
deep
woods
roar
assault
the
giant
trees
and
lay
them
low
as
billows
toss
the
seaweed
on
the
shore
as
sweeping
sickles
do
the
ripe
fields
mow
cuchullin
rolling
fiercely
on

foe
broke
through
the
linked
ranks
upon
the
plain
to
drench
the
field
with
blood
and
round
him
heap
the
slain
and
when
he
reach
a
that
stood
in
feignèd
strife
upon
a
knoll
of
green
their
weapons
clashing
but
unstained
with
blood
a
satirist
him
besought
to
intervene
whereat
he
slew
them
as
he
drave
between
thy
spear
to
me
the
satirist
cried
the
while
the
hero
answering
nay
he
cried
i
thee
revile
for
churlishness
i
have
been
cuchullin
call
in
his
pride
and
cast
his
ashen
spear
and
keen
and
slew
the
satirist
and
nine
beside
then
his
fresh
onslaught
made
the
host
divide
and
flee
before
him
clamouring
with
fear
the
while
the
stealthy
lugaid
seized
cuchullin
spear
o

of

did
lugaid
call
what
falleth
by
the
weapon
i
hold
here
together
they
acclaim
a
king
will
fall
for
so
foretold
they
said
the
aged
seer
then
at
the
chariot
he
flung
the
spear
and
laegh
was
stricken
unto
death
and
fell
cuchullin
drew
the
spear
and
bade
a
last
farewell
the
victor
i
and
eke
the
charioteer
he
cried
and
drave
the
fierce
and
fast
another
pair
he
slew
to
me
thy
spear
again
a
satirist
call
the
spear
was
cast
and
through
the
satirist
and
nine
men
but
lugaid
grasps
it
and
again
doth
call
what
falleth
by
this
spear
they
shout
a
king
will
fall
then
fall
cried
lugaid
as
he
flung
the
spear
the
grey
of
macha
sank
in
death
fierce
throes
snapping
the
yoke
the
while
the
black
ran
clear
cuchullin
groan
and
dash
upon
his
foes
another
pair
he
slew
with
rapid

twice
before

they
cried

and

the

of

is
slain
for

and

fell
the

snapp
the

and
left
alone
the

dying
on

from

thirsted
in
fierce
pain
we
give
thee
leave

thou
must
come

said
then
low
made
answer
he
if

i
bid

his

he
bound
and
to
the

did
hie
and
drank
his

and
wash
and
made
no

then
came
the
brave
cuchullin
forth
to
die
sublimely
fearless
strengthless
and
alone
he
wended
to
the
standing
clutching
his
sword
and
leaning
on
his
spear
and
to
his
foemen
called
come
ye
and
meet
me
here
a
vision
swept
upon
his
fading
brain
a
passing
vision
glorious
and
sweet
that
hour
of
youth
return
to
him
again
when
he
took

with
fearless
heart
as
cathbad
the
magician
did
repeat
who
taketh
arms
upon
this
day
of
grief
his
name
shall
live
forever
and
his
life
be
brief
fronting
his
foes
he
stood
with
fearless
eye
his
body
to
the
he
bound
nor
sitting
nor
would
he
die
he
would
die
standing
so
they
gathered
round
in
silent
wonder
on
the
ground
and
watch
the
hero
who
with
death
could
strive

no
