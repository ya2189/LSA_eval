preface
when
city
people
go
among
forests
and
hills
they
drink
in
the
fresh
air
and
weird
scenery
of
rural
surroundings
with
much
more
relish
enjoyment
and
appreciation
than
do
the
residents
they
find
there
for
the
same
reason
the
great
drama
of
metropolitan
existence
falls
most
forcibly
upon
those
just
from
the
clear
streams
and
green
meadows
of
the
country
their
impressions
then
are
deeper
and
their
feelings
more
intense
than
if
they
were
city
born
and
bred
with
the
latter
fact
in
view
this
book
is
an
effort
to
reproduce
some
of
the
effects
of
city
scenes
and
character
upon
the
intellect
and
imagination
of
two
people
from
the
country
first
a
young
student
who
has
travelled
the
roads
of
a
college
course
but
is
just
entering
real
life
and
now
for
the
first
time
walks
the
paved
and
streets
of
which
he
has
heard
and
read
so
much
second
an
old
farmer
with
very
little
but
a
clear
brain
a
warm
heart
and
independent
judgment
and
a
habit
of
philosophizing
upon
everything
he
sees
which
habit
he
brings
to
the
city
and
applies
to
the
strange
facts
he
witnesses
these
with
certain
incidental
thoughts
and
characters
encountered
and
discussed
constitute
the
present
work
it
will
be
found
as
intended
sketchy
and
suggestive
rather
than
elaborate
and
complete
and
diaries
are
designed
not
so
much
for
the
history
of
a
career
or
an
event
as
a
light
to
the
memory
a
stimulus
to
the
imagination
and
a
help
to
the
heart
it
is
the
hope
of
the
author
that
his
book
may
perform
those
offices
for
you
his
readers
and
that
it
will
rouse
your
pity
of
pain
your
enjoyment
of
honest
mirth
your
hatred
of
sham
and
wrong
and
your
love
and
adoration
of
the
resolute
and
the
good
and
their
winsome
child
the
beautiful
in
which
case
he
shakes
hands
with
his
large
and
loved
constituency

here
in

ponder

long
pathways
i
wander
these
are
the

that
were
gleaming
all
through
my
juvenile
dreaming
this
is
the
something
i
heard
far
away
when
at
the
close
of
a
tired
summer
day
resting
from
work
on
the
lap
of
a
lawn
gazing
to
whither
the
had
gone
leaving
behind
him
his

something
by
which
i
was
told
bend
your

listen
come
to
my
splendors
that
glisten
either
to
triumph
they
call
you
or
to
what
worst

befall
you
this
is
the
something
that
thrilled
my

the
weird

had
kindled

do

by
you
you
just
as
good
as
when
with
aching
arm
i
cleared
and
worked
that
farm
and
every
night
in
those
hard
dear
old
days
was
one
of
my
most
unconditional
ways
when
to
my
labors
i
had
said
and
recompensed
my
appetite
and
talked
with
wife
and
traded
family
views
and
gathered
all
the
latest
township
news
and
dealt
my
sons
a
sly
fraternal
hit
and
flirted
with
my
daughters
just
a
bit
and
through
the
papers
tried
my
way
to
see
so
the
world
should
slip
out
from
under
me
as
i
was
saying
in
those
sweet
old
days
was
one
of
my
most
unconditional
ways
to
go
to
you
old
book
before
i
sleep
and
hand
you
over
all
the
day
to
keep
i
gave
you
up
what
weather
i
could
find
likewise
the
different
phases
of
my
mind
what
my
hard
hands
from
morn
to
night
had
done
and
what
my
mind
had
been
subsisting
on
what
accidents
had
touched
my
brain
with
doubt
and
what
successes
it
had
whittled
out
how
well
i
had
been
able
to
control
the
weather
fluctuations
of
my
soul
what
progress
or
what
failures
i
had
made
in
spying
round
and
stealing
nature
trade
the
seeds
of
actions
planted
long
ago
and
whether
they
had
blossomed
out
or
no
and
oft
from
what
you
of
the
past
could
tell
i
learned
to
steer
my
future
pretty
well
and
now
i
rich
who
ever
thought
be
i
stand
by
you
as
you
have
stood
by
me
and
now
i
city
people
having
moved
my
circumstances
suddenly
improved
into
this
town
with
some
pelf
to
educate
my
children
and
myself
and
give
my
wife
who
has
a
pedigree
a
chance
to
flutter
round
her
family
tree
and
show
her
natural
city
airs
and
graces
which
did
take
quite
so
well
in
country
places
now
we
are
here
old
fellow
while
we
stay
i
give
you
all
the
news
from
day
to

i
find
the
good
that
in
this
city
lurks
by
regular
systematic
hard
days
works
i
rummage
fearless
round
amongst
the
harm
as
when
i
hoed
up
thistles
on
my
farm
shake
hands
with
virtue
help
sin
while
i
spurn
it
and
if
there
anything
to
learn
i
learn
it
how
little
i
suspected
by
the
way
scrambling
for
pennies
in
that
patch
of
clay
the
bare
expenses
of
our
lives
to
meet
that
waves
of
wealth
were
washing
at
my
feet
and
when
my
hard
and
rather
lazy
soil
sprung
a
leak
upward
with
when
through
the
wonder
in
my
glad
old
eyes
i
saw
tall
derricks
by
the
hundred
rise
flinging
wealth
at
me
with
unceasing
hand
and
turning
to
a
mine
my
hard
old
land
until
it
seemed
as
if
the
spell
would
hold
till
every
blade
of
grass
was
turned
to
gold
i
felt
as
never
yet
had
come
to
me
how
little
round
the
curves
of
life
we
see
or
in
our
rushings
on
suspect
or
view
what
sort
of
stations
we
are
coming
to
it
brought
a
similar
twinge
though
not
so
bad
as
once
when
losing
every
cent
i
had
but
still
it
could
not
shift
my
general
views
my
mind
did
faint
at
one
good
piece
of
news
i
think
i
too
much
ballast
my
sail
to
be
capsized
by
one
good
prosperous
gale
same
as
i
did
lie
down
and
give
up
all
that
other
time
when
tipped
up
by
a
squall
i
did
go
spreeing
for
my
money
sake
or
with
my
business
matters
lie
awake
never
do
as
i
informed
my
wife
to
let
a
little
money
spoil
our
life
and
now
i
rich
who
ever
thought
be
i
look
about
and
see

i
can
see

myself

to
act

all

will
in
the
journey
bring
himself
more
nigh
and
what
i
see

acre
i
behold
has
cost
a
mine
of
californi
gold
the
very
ground
one
building
here
might
fill
would
almost
buy
the
town
of
tompkins
hill
there
is
a
house
my
scrutiny
has
crossed
but
catches
several
figures
in
its
cost
and
when
your
eyes
into
the
parlor
go
things
they
leave
the
curtains
up
to
show
and
see
the
carpets
rugs
and
draperies
rich
that
twine
ten
dollars
into
every
stitch
and
view
great
pictures
that
such
prices
hold
as
if
the
painter
brush
were
dipped
in
gold
and
when
along
the
roads
great
buggies
glide
with
covers
on
and
folks
inside
and
up
on
top
a
man
to
drive
the
team
as
fat
as
any
cat
brought
up
on
cream
man
and
team
both
the
driver
dressed
as
gay
as
if
he
meant
to
marry
that
same
day
or
wed
his
boss
daughter
that
same
night
which
some
consider
as
the
coachman
right
and
think
it
understood
when
he
engages
a
daughter
should
be
thrown
in
with
his
wages
when
even
the
horses
as
so
many
do
wear
jewelry
that
cost
a
farm
or
two
you
wonder
in
what
grew
the
cash
to
buy
so
much
reality
and
trash
wealth
wealth
wealth
wealth
the
very
corner
stores
are
from
the
ceilings
to
the
floors
the
shop
we
thought
would
ruin
cousin
phil
because
was
for
tompkins
hill
would
in
the
small
lose
its
way
of
one
man
place
i
wandered
through
and
then
the
banks
a
hundred
on
one
street
as
full
of
money
as
an
egg
of
meat
although
one
never
knows
beyond
a
doubt
what
colored
chickens
they
be
hatching
out
and
then
the
churches
elegant
to
view
an
independent
fortune
in
each
pew
one
in
one
big
church
that
here
cost
more
than
our
old
preacher
made
per
year
a
city
pastor
salary
i
declare
would
keep
all
his
life
with
cash
to
spare
in
that
little
house
of
wood
holding
his
hearers
eyes
in
all
he
could
with
rolling
meadows
and
green
trees
in
view
and
streamlets
wandering
through
and
then
the
rich
in
this
town
where
children
can
be
taught
and
down
swifter
if
not
so
thorough
i
suppose
than
in
the
small
log
where
i
rose
from
numeration
to
the
rule
of
three
and
had
irregular
verbs
whipped
into
me
and
then
the
railroad
stations
where
each
day
fortunes
on
wheels
rush
in
and
drive
away
and
then
the
steamboats
paddling
up
and
down
swimming
on
their
way
from
town
to
town
and
then
the
ladies
in
both
street
and
store
done
up
in
silks
and
satins
spangled
as
if
it
had
rained
diamonds
for
an
hour
and
they
had
gone
and
stood
out
in
the
shower
and
then
the
rich
and
young
men
the
rising
generation
upper
with
the
left
off
who
each
day
no
doubt
spend
twice
as
much
as
all
my
setting
out
when
father
said
the
family
craft
is
full
launch
your
own
craft
and
show
us
how
to
pull
i
often
think
when
past
a
dandy
glides
throwing
his
father
money
on
all
sides
and
peeking
under
each
young
lady
veil
as
if
he
bought
her
at
a
mortgage
sale
how
shrewd
it
was
of
him
right
on
the
start
to
have
a
father
who
was
rich
and
smart
folks
often
pride
themselves
much
because
their
parents
greater
were
than
they
walking
along
fifth
avenue
a
slip
of
paper
on
the
sidewalk
flew
before
my
eyes
some
one
the
same
had
dropped
i
reached
my
hand
down
for
it
and
it
stopped
i
picked
it
up
the
reading
o
was
queer
i
think
perhaps
i
paste
it
right
in
here
the
lovely
young
man
oh
the
elements
varied
the
exquisite
plan
that
are
used
in
constructing
the
lovely
young
man
his
face
he
has
easily
made
to
possess
the
expression
of
nothing
within
to
express
his
hair

oiled
glossily
back
of
his
ears
atop
of
his
head
an
equator
appears
his
scanty
mustache
has
symmetrical
bends
is
groomed
with
precision
and
waxed
at
both
ends
his
darling
complexion
bewitching
to
see
is
powdered
the
same
as
a
lady
might
be
and
this
is
the
dear
whom
the
newspapers
rude
have
scornfully
treated
and
christened
the
the
mental
equipment
i
tell
if
i
can
that
nature
has
given
the
lovely
young
man
a
set
of
emotions
consistently
weak
to
go
with
a
creature
so
gentle
and
meek
a
will
no
opposing
can
break
or
surmount

all
matters

no

up

a

then
retreated

think
you
lost

she
dodged

i
not
very
well
am
home
again

with
my

all
that
i
can
make
it
say
to
me
is
wealth
wealth
wealth

much
i
hear
and
see
strange
how
on
human
brains
sixteen
times
is
stamped
and
carved

magic
word
of

some
several
thousands
to
my
credit

in
a
small
bank
on

street
handy
by

i
ca
help
contriving
what
i
do
if
i
possessed
the
whole
too
or
if
i
had
to
take
a
modest
tone
a
million
million
dollars
all
my
own
the
subject
took
so
strong
a
growth
in
me
i
overtalked
the
same
last
night
at
tea
and
so
my
oldest
daughter
who
can
rhyme
and
strikes
some
notes
that
with
her
father
chime
became
with
that
same
foolishness
possessed
so
much
so
that
it
would
not
let
her
rest
but
hung
about
her
bedside
all
the
night
and
brought
its
capabilities
in
sight
so
much
so
that
she
threw
it
into
verse
as
bad
as
that
her
father
writes
or
worse
and
then
with
some
unconscious
girlish
grace
and
blushes
chasing
all
about
her
face

in
a
way
i
learned
to
understand
quite
slipped
it
in
my

made
in

privately

paste
it
right
in

love
outpoured

could
afford
if
i
a

an
honest
million

the

success
that
gave
me
all
those

circle
of
my
sight
and
resurrect
him
with
such
food
as
should
go
far
to
make
him
good
no
but
must
bow
its
head
and
gaze
at
cottage
walls
instead
and
hungry
paupers
soon
should
see
a
year
of
genuine
jubilee
nought
should
alloy
their
perfect
joy
that
could
be
saved
by
millions
just
think
a
million
millions
the
care
of
all
those
millions
and
after
all
what
would
befall
a
life
with
all
those
millions
would
not
the
lucre
clog
my
brain
and
make
me
hard
and
cold
and
vain
might
not
my
treasure
win
my
heart
and
make
me
loath
with
it
to
part
how
could
i
tell
by
mortal
sign
betwixt
my
money
friends
and
mine
and
then
the
greed
and
strife
and
curse
the
world
brings
round

in

everywhere
on
all

family
healthy
sensible
and
pleasant
and
each
one
got
the
proper
at
least
it
seems
so
for
they
all
act
suited
and
santa
claus
taste
has
been
disputed
our
family
room
is
filled
with
tasty
mixings
of
evergreens
and
other
the
open
grate
makes
things
look
rich
and
mellow
with
good
hard
coals
the
fire
has
painted
yellow
pictures
peep
from
the
walls
with
all
through
them
that
set
me
studying
every
time
i
view
them
there
certain
books
upon
the
that
say
what
i
have
said
if
i
been
able
and
measuring
up
this
room
with
honest
style
is
a
bad
place
to
be
in
for
a
while
and
so
i
sit
here
thinking
musing
dreaming
about
the
world
and
all
its
curious
scheming
and
full
of
doubt
wondering
what
this
life
is
all
about
from
all
that
i
can
learn
i
not
to
blame
for
wiser
men
have
often
done
the
same
we
went
a
mile
or
two
last
night
to
see
the
decorations
on
a
i
spied
hung
on
that
sapling
gilded
arms
things
that
would
buy
a
couple
good
sized
farms
and
just
upon
our
way
home
i
should
guess
we
met
some
fifty
people
more
or
less
who
needed
to
make
passable
their
days
a
decent
share
of
what
those
farms
would
raise
but
here
the
question
should
those
deprive
rich
people
of
their
comforts
too
because
there
are
some
people
lack
for
bread
must
others
minds
and
fancies
go
unfed
it
quite
a
puzzle
which
i
do
know
whether
my
clumsy
mind
knows
how
to
put
together
but
one
thing
sure
wants
satisfied
wants
breed
the
more
folks
get
the
more
they
seem
to
need
then
one
man
lives
on
what
would
starve
another
and
what
is
joy
for
you
might
kill
your
brother
although
it
does
contain
the
charm
of
our
old
wide
log
on
the
farm
january
went
to
a
a
little
while
to
see
them
slide
in
the
style
and
strange
enough
this
eve
a
letter
came
from
a
friend
abdiel
stebbins
is
his
name
a
cousin
of
my
aunt
sophia
dean
a
wise
old
man
but
clumsy
like
and
green
he
on
a
visit
in
a
neighboring
city
and
he
has
been
more
the
pity
he
tells
it
in
a
manner
quite
sincere
i
think
perhaps
i
paste
it
right
in
here
farmer
stebbins
on
rollers
rochester
dear
cousin
john
we
got
here
safe
my
worthy
wife
an
me
an
put
up
at
james
sunnyhopes
a
pleasant
place
to
be
an
isabel
his
oldest
girl
is
home
from
school
just
now
an
pets
me
with
her
manners
all
her
young
man
will
allow
an
his
good
wife
has
monstrous
sweet
an
culinary
ways
it
is
a
summery
place
to
pass
a
few
cold
winter
days
besides
i
various
friends
in
different
parts
o
town
that
always
glad
to
have
me
call
whenever
i
come
down
but
day
when
the
same
i
undertook
to
roam
i
could
not
find
a
single
one
that
seemed
to
be
to
home
an
when
i
asked
their
whereabouts
the
answer
was
i
think
if
you
down
that
way
you
find
at
the
rink
i
asked
what
night
the
lyceum
folks
would
hold
their
next
debate
i
sometimes
gone
an
helped
wield
the
cares
of
church
an
state
an
if
protracted
meetin
now
was
holdin
anywhere
i
like
to
get
my
soul
fed
up
with
fresh
celestial
fare
or
when
the
next
church
social
was
they
give
a
knowin
wink
an
say
i
there
nothin
now
transpirin
but
the
rink
what
is
this
i
innocent
inquired
that
night
at
tea
oh
you
must
go
said
isabel
this
very
night
with
me
and
stebbins
she
must
go
an
skate
there
with
us
too
my
wife
replied
my
dear
just
please
inform
me
when
i
do
but
you
two
go
an
so
we
went
an
saw
a
circus
there
with
which
few
sights
i
ever
struck
will
anyways
compare
it
seems
a
had
given
up
its
pews
the
church
an
pastor
had
resigned
from
spiritual
blues
an
several
acres
of
the
floor
was
made
a
skatin
ground
where
folks
of
every
shape
an
size
went
skippin
round
an
round
an
in
the
midst
a
big
brass
band
was
helpin
on
the
fun
an
everything
was
gay
as
sixteen
weddin
joined
in
one
i
seen
small
insects
go
circlin
through
the
air
an
wondered
if
they
thought
some
time
they
maybe
get
somewhere
i
seen
a
million
go
scootin
round
an
round
an
wondered
what
was
all
about
or
what
they
lost
or
found
but
men
an
women
boys
an
girls
upon
a
floor
all
whirlin
round
like
folks
possessed
i
never
saw
before
an
then
it
straight
came
back
to
me
the
things
i
read
an
heard
about
the
rinks
an
how
their
ways
was
wicked
an
absurd
i
learned
somewhere
that
skatin
was
a
healthy
thing
to
do
but
there
was
doctor
saddlebags
his
with
him
too
i
heard
that
was
a
proper
place
for
christian
folks
to
seek
old
deacon
perseverance
jinks
flew
past
me
like
a
streak
then
sister
sunnyhopes
put
on
a
pair
o
skates
an
started
off
as
if
she
run
through
several
different
states
my
goodness
how
that
gal
showed
up
i
never
did
opine
that
she
could
twist
herself
to
look
so
charmin
an
so
fine
and
then
a
fellow
that
she
knew
took
hold
o
hands
with
her
a
sort
o
double
crossways
like
an
helped
her
as
it
were
used
to
skate
an
was
a
sport
of
which
i
once
was
fond
why
i
could
write
my
autograph
on
tompkins
pond
of
course
to
slip
on
runners
that
is
one
thing
one
may
say
an
movin
round
on
casters
is
a
somewhat
different
way
but
when
the
fun
that
fellow
had
came
flashin
to
my
eye
i
says
i
young
again
by
george
i
skate
once
more
or
die
a
little
boy
a
pair
o
skates
to
fit
my
boots
soon
found
he
had
to
put
on
for
me
i
weigh
three
hundred
pound
an
then
i
straightened
up
an
says
look
here
you
younger
chaps
you
think
you
runnin
past
us
older
heads
perhaps
if
this
young
lady
here
to
me
will
trust
awhile
her
fate
i
go
around
a
dozen
times
an
show
you
how
to
skate
she
was
a
niceish
plump
young
gal
i
noticed
quite
a
while
an
she
reached
out
her
hands
with
too
daughterly
a
smile
but
off
we
pushed
with
might
an
main
when
all
to
once
the
wheels
departed
suddenly
above
an
took
along
my
heels
my
head
assailed
the
floor
as
if
was
tryin
to
get
through
an
all
the
stars
i
ever
saw
arrived
at
once
in
view
was
as
not
quite
unlike
a
there
i
lay
how
many
of
the
other
folks
was
goin
that
same
way
they
stumbled
over
me
in
one
large
animated
heap
an
formed
a
pile
o
legs
an
arms
not
far
from
ten
foot
deep
but
after
they
had
all
climbed
off
in
rather
fierce
surprise
i
lay
there
like
a
still
considerin
how
to
rise
then
dignified
i
rose
with
hands
upon
my
ample
waist
an
then
sat
down
again
with
large
and
very
painful
haste
an
rose
again
and
started
off
to
find
a
place
to
rest
then
on
my
gentle
stomach
stood
an
tore
my
meetin
vest
when
sister
sunnyhopes
slid
up
as
trim
as
trim
could
be
an
she
an
her
young
fellow
took
compassionate
charge
o
me
then
after
i
got
off
the
skates
an
flung
out
o
reach
i
rose
while
all
grew
hushed
an
still
an
made
the
followin
speech
my
friends
i
struck
a
small
idea
an
struck
it
pretty
square
which
an
morally
will
some
attention
bear
those
who
their
balance
can
preserve
are
safe
here
any
day
an
those
who
ca
i
rather
think
had
better
keep
away
illustration
when
all
to
once
the
wheels
departed
suddenly
above
an
took
along
my
heels
then
i
limped
out
with
very
strong
unprecedented
pains
an
hired
a
horse
at
liberal
rates
to
draw
home
my
remains
an
lay
abed
three
days
while
wife
laughed
at
an
nursed
me
well
an
used
up
all
the
arnica
two
had
to
sell
an
when
miss
sunnyhopes
said
wo
you
skate
some
more
i
answered
not
while
i
remain
on
this
terrestrial
shore

want
o
god
forgive
the
crime
if
i
asleep
awake
at
any
time
upon
my
bended
knees
my
back
my
feet
in
church
on
bed
on
street
have
ever
or
much
less
have
pleaded
that
i
had
ten
times
over
all
i
needed

save
my
soul
i
never
knew
the
way
that
people
starve
along
from
day
to
day
may
gracious
heaven
forgive
me
and
that
i
have
never
found
these
folks
before
of
course
some
news
of
it
has
come
my
way
like
a
faint
echo
on
a
drowsy
day
at
home
i
gave
by
suffering
grieved
and
called
it
charity
and
felt
relieved
and
thought
that
i
was
never
undertasked
if
i
bestowed
when
with
due
deference
asked
but
no
one
finds
the
i
doubt
unless
he
goes
himself
and
hunts
them
out
and
when
you
get
among
be
thankful
if
your
are
not
wrung
these
thoughts
sobbed
through
me
this
cold
snowy
day
as
carefully
i
picked
a
dubious
way
nakedness
and
want
on
every
side
and
a
rough
masculine
angel
for
my
guide
who
goes
about
among
affliction
heirs
and
gives
his
life
to
piece
out
some
of
theirs
up
up
up
up
and
yet
i
am
afraid
farther
from
heaven
at
every
step
we
made
gaunt
hungry
creatures
stood
on
every
side
with
cheeks
drawn
close
and
sad
eyes
opened
wide
filled
to
the
brim
with
greedy
starving
prayers
as
we
went
past
them
up
the
creaking
stairs
and
i
peeped
into
rooms
was
death
to
see
or
rather
they
peeped
darkly
out
at
me
such
as
i
would
have
had
the
cheek
to
shown
to
any
swine
i
ever
chanced
to
own
was
sad
to
see
in
this
great
how
guilt
and
innocence
were
all
mixed
up
here
lay
a
fellow
stupid
dull
and
dumb
whose
breath
was
like
a
broken
keg
of
rum
and
there
a
baby
looking
scared
and
odd
who
had
not
been
a
week
away
from
god
here
a
clean
woman
toiling
for
her
bread
and
there
a
wretch
whose
dirty
heart
was
dead
here
a
sound
rascal
lazy
loud
and
bold
and
there
the
helpless
weak
and
sick
and
old
want
want
o
lord
forgive
me
and
that
i
have
found
these
suffering
folks
before
we
had
a
decent
in
our
town
and
i
would
often
drive
my
spare
horse
down
and
take
a
little
stroll
among
them
there
and
try
to
cheer
their
despair
and
with
their
little
wants
and
worries
join
and
chink
round
them
with
small
bits
of
coin
done
up
in
good
advice
somewhat
severe
and
send
them
christmas
turkeys
every
year
then
in
my
cosy
home
think
with
a
grin
what
a
fine
liberal
angel
i
had
been
but
here
o
heavens
i
find
them
high
and
low
hundreds
of
in
a
row
and
suffering
suffering
in
a
shape
i
vow
that
makes
my
poor
old
tears
run
even
now
for
city
trouble
any
one
will
find
is
more
ingenious
than
the
country
kind
and
has
a
thousand
ways
to
torture
men
and
shorten
off
their
days
and
while
we
wonder
that
god
made
it
so
he
does
seem
very
anxious
we
should
know
but
he
is
willing
we
should
search
his
plan
and
pry
around
and
find
out
all
we
can
and
i
suspect
when
pains
and
troubles
fall
that
every
one
is
useful
after
all
at
any
rate
the
miseries
that
i
see
are
useful
in
their
good
effects
on
me
and
though
that
is
a
great
thing
on
the
whole
though
heaven
put
a
premium
on
each
soul
yet
there
are
several
people
i
suspect
who
need
a
little
of
that
same
effect
and
if
they
do
not
get
it
old
and
young
be
because
i
lost
my
poor
old
tongue
one
more
small
portion
of
god
plan
i
see
concerning
its
effect
on
even
me
and
that
its
leading
me
by
methods
queer
to
be
some
help
to
these
poor
people
here
for
now
i
promise
from
this
very
night
and
hereby
put
it
down
in
black
and
white
that
out
of
every
day

given
me
yet
and
out
of
every

can

large

february
wind
in
the
south
a
fresh
sweet
winter
day
have
been
sad
to
see
it
go
away
if
not
that
the
sunset
glimmered
awhile
across
the
jersey
heights
then
lightly
dancing
the
river
came
and
set
some
new
york
windows
all
aflame
from
a
clear
sunset
i
can
always
borrow
god
sweet
half
promise
of
a
fair
but
while
i
gazed
upon
that
splendid
sight
my
mind
take
a
heavy
flight
up
to
a
small
back
garret
far
away
where
i
had
stood
at
two
want
want
want
want
it
hung
everywhere
it
threw
its
odors
on
the
sickly
air
the
room
was
somewhat
smaller
to
begin
than
i
would
put
a
span
of
horses
in
the
floor
was
rough
and
damp
as
floor
could
be
no
picture
on
the
walls
but
poverty
the
bed
was
ragged
scanty
hard
and
drear
a
empty
crib
was
standing
near
the
window
never
felt
the
sun
warm
stare
or
breathed
a
breath
of
good
air
illustration
yes
it
straight
and
true
good
preacher
every
word
that
you
have
said
a
little
doll
some
child
had
had
looking
like
its
surroundings
rough
and
sad
and
dressed
in
rags
and
pinched
and
but
bearing
still
some
marks
of
girlish
taste
a
gaunt
gray
kitten
showing
every
sign
that
it
was
on
the
last
life
of
its
nine
though
trying
hard
to
feel
quite
sleek
and
fat
and
not
a
very
desolate
cat
a
man
so
grieved
my
heart
can
see
him
now
with
frightful
sorrow
printed
on
his
brow
a
rough
wood
coffin
stood
there
near
the
bed
looking
uneasy
even
for
the
dead
a
little
pallid
face
i
saw
therein
a
child
she
must
have
been
as
sweet
as
ever
need
to
feed
a
glance
if
she
had
only
had
a
chance
but
still
she
woke
a
thought
i
could
not
smother
that
child
was
murdered
in
some
way
or
other
and
my
opinion
did
seem
much
amiss
when
the
man
spoke
up
something
like
to
this
all
this
above
the
shoulder
i
could
see
of
an
old
preacher
who
had
come
with
me
a
man
who
those
garrets
earns
they
say
a
house
and
lot
in
heaven
every
day
that
swamp
of
death
yes
it
straight
and
true
good
preacher
every
word
that
you
have
said
do
not
think
these
tears
unmanly
they
the
first
ones
i
have
shed
but
they
kind
o
beat
and
pounded
my
aching
heart
and
brain
and
they
would
not
be
let
go
of
and
they
gave
me
extra
pain
i
am
just
a
laboring
man
sir
work
for
food
and
rags
and
sleep
and
i
hardly
know
the
meaning
of
the
life
i
slave
to
keep
but
i
know
when
times
are
cheery
or
my
heart
is
made
of
lead
i
know
sorrow
when
i
see
it
and
i
know
my
girl
is
dead
no
she
is
much
to
look
at
just
a
plainish
bit
of
clay
of
the
sort
of
perished
children
that
die
here
every
day
and
how
could
break
a
heart
up
you
be
slow
to
understand
but
she
held
mr
preacher
in
that
little
withered
hand
there
are
lots
of
prettier
children
with
a
face
and
form
more
fine
let
their
parents
love
and
pet
them
but
little
one
was
there
was
no
one
else
to
cling
to
when
we
two
were
torn
apart
and
it
death
this
amputation
of
the
strong
arms
of
the
heart
i
am
just
an
ignorant
man
sir
of
the
kind
that
digs
and
delves
but
i
learned
that
human
beings
can
not
stay
in
by
themselves
they
will
reach
out
after
something
be
it
good
or
be
it
bad
and
my
heart
on
hers
had
settled
and
the
girl
was
all
i
had
illustration
choked
and
strangled
by
the
foul
breath
of
the
chimneys
over
there
yes
it
solid
mr
preacher
every
word
that
you
have
said
god
loves
children
while
they
living
and
adopts
them
when
they
dead
but
i
can
not
help
contriving
do
the
very
best
i
can
that
it
was
god
mercy
took
her
but
the
selfishness
of
man
why
she
lay
here
faint
and
gasping
moaning
for
a
bit
of
air
choked
and
strangled
by
the
foul
breath
of
the
chimneys
over
there
it
climbed
through
every
window
and
crept
under
every
door
and
i
tried
to
bar
against
it
and
she
only
choked
the
more
illustration
oh
the
air
is
pure
and
wholesome
where
some
babies
coo
and
rest
and
they
trim
them
out
with
ribbons
and
they
feed
them
with
the
best
she
would
lie
there
with
the
old
look
that
poor
children
somehow
get
she
had
learned
to
use
her
patience
and
she
did
not
cry
or
fret
but
would
lift
her
little
face
up
so
piteous
and
so
fair
and
would
whisper
am
dying
for
a
little
breath
of
air
if
she
gone
off
through
the
sunlight
have
seemed
so
hard
to
me
or
among
the
fresh
cool
breezes
that
come
sweeping
from
the
sea
but
it
nothing
less
than
murder
when
my
darling
every
breath
chokes
and
strangles
with
the
poison
from
that
chimney
swamp
of
death
oh
it
not
enough
those
people
own
the
very
ground
we
tread
and
the
shelter
that
we
crouch
in
and
the
tools
that
earn
our
bread
they
must
place
their
blotted
mortgage
on
the
air
and
on
the
sky
and
shut
out
our
little
heaven
till
our
children
pine
and
die
oh
the
air
is
pure
and
wholesome
where
babies
coo
and
rest
and
they
trim
them
out
with
ribbons
and
they
feed
them
with
the
best
but
the
love
they
bear
is
mockery
to
the
gracious
god
on
high
if
to
give
those
children
luxuries
some
one
else
child
must
die
oh
we
wear
the
cheapest
clothing
and
our
meals
are
scant
and
brief
and
perhaps
those
fellows
fancy
there
a
cheaper
grade
of
grief
but
the
people
all
around
here
losing
children
friends
and
mates
can
inform
them
that
has
any
i
no
grumbler
at
the
rulers
of
this
free
and
happy
land
and
i
do
go
explaining
things
i
do
not
understand
but
i
know
there
something
treacherous
in
the
working
of
the
law
we
get
a
dose
of
poison
out
of
every
breath
we
i
have
talked
too
much
good
preacher
and
i
hope
you
wo
be
vexed
but
going
to
make
a
sermon
with
that
white
face
for
a
text
and
i
preach
it
and
i
preach
it
till
i
set
the
people
wild
the
heartless
reckless
grasping
of
the

who
killed
my
child

yes
it

i
seen
a
one
who
had
a
perfect
right
it
seemed
to
me
the
mistress
of
a
happy
home
to
be
and
yet
we
found
her
on
a
ragged
bed
one
white
arm
underneath
a
shapely
head
her
long
bright
hair
was
lying
fold
on
fold
like
finest
threads
spun
from
a
bar
of
gold
her
face
was
chiselled
after
beauty
style
and
want
had
not
hewn
out
its
witching
smile
was
like
white
marble
half
endowed
with
breath
the
face
of
this
sweet
maiden
starved
to
death
not
far
from
where
she
lay
so
sadly
lone
her
calendar
or
diary
was
thrown
they
let
me
have
it
when
the
law
had
read
this
plaintive
girlish
message
from
the
dead
it
does
look
well
among
these
notes
to
stay
of
one
who
feeds
on
blessings
every
day
but
i
will
put
it
in
here
for
my
heart
to
look
at
when
i
feel
too
proud
and
smart
a
diary
february
here
am
i
here
or
is
it
fancy
born
of
fear
yes
o
god
save
me
this
is
i
and
not
some
wretch
of
whom
i
read
in
that
bright
girlhood
when
the
sky
each
night
strewed
my
head
when
each
morn
meant
a
and
all
my
little
world
was
gay
i
had
not
felt
the
touch
of
care
i
heard
of
something
called
despair
but
knew
it
only
by
its
name
how
far
it
seemed
how
soon
it
came
yes
all
the
bright
years
hurried
by
sorrow
was
near
and
this
is
i
the
same
girl
that
stood
one
night
there
in
the
wide
hall
thrilling
light
with
all
the
costly
robes
astir
that
love
and
pride
had
bought
for
her
how
the
great
crowd
their
kind
din
gazed
with
gaunt
eyes
and
drank
me
in
and
then
they
hushed
at
each
low
word
so
death
himself
might
have
been
heard
to
hear
me
mournfully
rehearse
the
tender
hood
pathetic
verse
about
the
woman
who
half
dead
stitched
her
frail
life
in
every
thread
how
little
then
i
knew
the
need
yet
for
my
own
sex
i
did
plead
and
my
heart
crept
on
each
word
track
till
soft
sobs
from
the
crowd
came
back
illustration
the
same
girl
that
stood
one
night
there
in
the
wide
hall
thrilling
light
i
saw
my
sister
yet
bearing
still
a
face
of
pride
oh
sister
when
you
looked
at
me
with
that
quick
yearning
glance
of
love
did
you
peer
on
to
what
might
be
is
and
is
it
known
above
when
that
great
throng
a
shout
did
raise
and
gave
me
words
of
praise
and
loving
eyes
their
incense
burned
till
my
young
girlish
head
was
turned
did
your
clear
eye
see
farther
then
a
moment
past
all
mortal
ken
and
in
the
dreary
scene
i
drew
did
my
own
form
appear
to
you
it
might
have
been
grief
was
and
god
have
pity
this
is
i
treading
a
steep
and
way
and
earning
twenty
cents
a
day
february
father
this
is
the
time
we
hailed
as
your
bright
birthday
we
failed
to
throng
about
with
love
fond
arts
and
bring
you
presents
from
our
hearts
your
pleasure
filled
our
day
with
bliss
oh
what
a
different
one
from
this
my
love
my
father
how
you
stood
me
and
all
that
was
not
good
how
each
breath
i
drew
my
turned
and
clung
to
you
how
near
comes
back
that
dismal
day
you
sat
with
naught
to
say
from
morn
till
night
i
did
not
dare
even
to
ask
to
soothe
your
care
i
knew
it
was
too
sadly
grand
to
feel
the
light
touch
of
my
hand
ah
friends
you
loved
had
gone
astray
and
swept
our
competence
away
and
oh
i
strove
so
hard
to
save
your
honored
gray
hairs
from
the
grave
too
late
your
sun
went
down
clouded
in
life
you
guarded
me
with
patience
rare
from
the
shadow
of
a
care
you
called
me
princess
and
my
room
was
dressed
as
palaces
might
be
and
here
i
am
amid
this
gloom
that
mocks
insults
and
murders
me
striving
a
garret
rent
to
pay
and
earning
twenty
cents
a
day
february
i
can
not
well
afford
to
write
my
fingers
are
in
call
elsewhere
but
i
must
voice
my
black
despair
or
i
should
die
before
was
night
i
have
no
mother
now
to
call
and
seek
her
heart
and
tell
her
all
o
mother
well
i
know
you
rest
in
yonder
heaven
serene
and
blest
how
sadly
strangely
sweet
be
to
know
you
knew
and
pitied
me
and
yet
i
would
not
have
you
dream
of
the
dagger
faintest
gleam
that
pointing
at
my
maiden
breast
rest
on
sweet
mother
sweetly
rest
and
still
i
feel
your
loving
art
sometimes
upon
my
aching
heart
that
night
i
stood
upon
the
pier
and
the
gray
river
swept
so
near
and
glanced
up
at
me
in
a
way
some
one
with
friendly
voice
might
say
come
to
my
arms
and
rest
poor
girl
and
i
leaned
down
with
head
awhirl
and
heart
so
heavy
it
might
sink
me
underneath
the
river
brink
a
hand
i
could
not
feel
or
see
drew
me
away
and
fondled
me
a
voice
i
felt
unheard
though
near
said
wait
you
must
not
enter
here
and
press
against
me
with
one
stain
poor
girl
not
long
you
need
remain
illustration
and
hateful
hunger
has
come
in
but
o
sweet
mother
i
must
write
the
words
that
would
be
said
if
you
could
hold
my
tired
head
here
i
can
not
see
one
gleam
of
cheer
this
is
a
garret
room
so
bleak
the
cold
air
stings
my
fading
cheek
fireless
my
room
my
garb
is
thin
and
hateful
hunger
has
come
in
and
says
toil
on
you
foolish
one
you
shall
be
mine
when
all
is
done
two
days
and
nights
of
pain
and
dread
i
gnawed
upon
a
crust
of
bread
for
what
scant
nourishment
give
so
hard
i
could
not
eat
and
live
o
mother
i
to
god
shall
pray
this
tale
in
heaven
may
be
told
for
you
are
where
whole
streets
are
gold
and
i
earn
twenty
cents
a
day
february
he
never
loved
me
for
no
one
could
love
and
do
as
he
has
done
how
my
heart
clung
and
clung
to
him
when
respect
and
faith
grew
dim
his
lightest
touch
could
thrill
me
so
weak
girl
was
hard
to
bid
him
go
though
wayward
was
his
heart
i
knew
i
would
have
sworn
that
he
was
true
oh
how
i
loved
him
or
maybe
loved
some
one
that
i
thought
was
he
they
brought
me
what
his
mangled
corse
would
god
they
had
they
brought
me
worse
i
saw
one
who
should
bear
his
name
one
whose
pale
face
was
fiercely
grieved
one
whom
he
wantonly
deceived
and
sentenced
to
a
life
of
shame
that
was
the
end
i
could
not
wed
a
man
whose
nobler
self
was
dead
o
man
a
brave
and
race
but
you
can
be
so
vile
and
base
and
when
there
is
no
urgent
need
you
can
protect
us
well
indeed
but
when
adversity
is
near
when
the
wave
breaks
upon
our
head
when
we
are
crushed
with
want
and
dread
then
we
have
most
from
you
to
fear
why
do
men
strangely
look
me
when
i
their
mercy
need
the
more
do
they
not
know
a
girl
may
taste
the
dregs
of
want
and
yet
be
chaste
should
woman
sell
her
soul
away
to
save
its
manacles
of
clay
february
all
honest
means
of
life
have
failed
the
small
accomplishments
i
tried
that
pleased
friends
in
my
days
of
pride
are
naught
but
vice
has
not
prevailed
and
thank
heaven
should
not
though
my
heart
were
torn
a
thousand
times
apart
but
god
shield
helpless
girls
alway
who
live
on
twenty
cents
a
day
february
weak
weak
still
weaker
do
i
grow
my
mournful
fate
i
can
but
know
god
keep
me
not
long
here
i
pray
to
toil
on
twenty
cents
a
day
february
oh
horrors
is
it
is
it
true
what
i
have
read
if
i
but
knew
o
god
tell
me
where
can
i
fly
not
to
be
found
when
i
shall
die
they
say
dead
waifs
are
oft
by
night
robbed
of
a
decent
burial
right
that
fiends
the
friendless
bodies
bear
to
crowds
of
waiting
students
where
men
tear
them
up
for
men
to
see
o
god
sweet
god
do
pity
me
and
i
will
humbly
pray
to
men
if
this
should
come
within
the
ken
of
one
who
lives
a
life
of
one
who
sister
has
or
wife
one
who
loves
women
for
the
best
that
is
in
them
whose
lips
have
pressed
pure
genuine
lips
whom
women
trust
whose
heart
is
free
from
loathsome
lust
one
whom
i
would
have
loved
if
he
brother
or
husband
were
to
me
i
ask
you
nay
i
do
command
with
that
imperiousness
you
so
like
from
a
white
and
shapely
hand
i
you
but
no
no
no
i
am
past
that
i
humbly
pray
that
you
will
see
that
i
unmarred
have
christian
burial
guard
oh
guard
you
men
with
manly
hearts
and
souls
my
poor
dead
body
from
the
ghouls
i
strove
alway
to
keep
it
pure
as
the
soul
in
me
it
has
been
type
of
the
thoughts
that
lived
within
the
white
slave
of
what
shall
endure
my
spirit
loved
though
humble
mate
let
none
its
white
limbs
desecrate
weaker
yet
weaker
is
to
die
this
sharp
pain
bids
me
ah
world
that
i
was
too
weak
for
march
back
from
a
journey
mournful
it
is
true
but
mingled
with
a
sweetness
too
after
the
law
with
that
poor
girl
was
done
i
found
permission
with
the
proper
one
and
though
such
things
by
law
could
not
occur
in
my
i
adopted
her
help
much
too
late
to
benefit
her
living
it
that
way
with
a
good
share
of
our
giving
but
with
a
father
love
poor
girl
i
said
you
shall
have
all
that
i
can
give
you
dead
i
found
by
lightning
inquiries
i
made
the
graveyard
where
her
own
loved
ones
were
laid
i
had
her
body
tenderly
removed
and
placed
among
the
dear
ones
that
she
loved
with
all
the
honor
that
the
poor
sweet
child
would
have
if
fortune
still
upon
her
smiled
and
when
once
more
the
flowers
of
summer
blow
my
wife
and
daughters
and
myself
will
go
and
make
the
sad
but
grateful
duty
ours
to
see
her
last
roofed
with
flowers
fire
farmer
harrington
march
fire
fire
fire
fire
it
sets
me
in
a
craze
to
see
a
building
all
ablaze
a
burning
house
resembles
when
i
nigh
some
old
acquaintance
just
about
to
die
for
structures
that
a
person
often
sees
look
some
like
human
beings
same
as
trees
there
used
to
be
some
trees
on
my
old
place
that
i
know
anywhere
just
by
their
face
and
when
last
night
some
bells
began
to
cry
and
big
rushed
and
rattled
by
in
just
three
minutes
down
the
stairs
i
strode
and
hurried
somewhat
dressed
into
the
road
partly
to
help
a
bit
if
so
might
be
and
partly
i
suppose
to
hear
and
see
it
was
a
dark
and
night
there
was
one
inch
of
honest
sky
in
sight
great
clouds
were
swimming
through
the
air
and
now
and
then
their
would
glare
and
like
a
lot
of
cannon
far
away
some
peals
of
thunder
came
from
the
bay
was
one
of
those
strange
nights
i
ca
explain
that
make
you
think
they
just
to
rain
but
never
do
save
now
and
then
a
trace
of
a
small
drop
comes
dashing
on
your
face
one
of
those
nights
that
try
to
keep
you
vexed
and
wondering
as
to
what
will
happen
next
i
like
such
times
they
kind
of
draw
me
nearer
to
things
unseen
and
make
all
mystery
clearer
i
ran
like
sin
and
reached
the
fire
at
last
a
church
was
going
pretty
fast
i
noticed
it
a
hundred
times
or
more
and
several
times
had
stepped
inside
the
door
the
burglar
flames
within
had
prowled
around
a
long
time
previous
to
their
being
found
till
they
had
gained
such
foothold
and
such
might
they
turned
to
robbers
stealing
plain
in
sight
the
dome
and
spires
had
on
them
flags
of
red
they
soon
came
thundering
down
from
overhead
it
looked
as
if
infernal
spirits
came
to
take
this
church
away
in
smoke
and
flame
i
wondered
in
that
wild
expensive
glare
how
many
of
the
flock
were
there
to
see
the
shelter
where
their
souls
had
fed
swept
from
existence
by
that
broom
of
red
here
was
the
family
pew
so
long
time
prized
there
was
the
font
where
they
had
been
baptized
here
was
the
altar
where
one
day
they
stood
started
for
heaven
and
promised
to
be
good
or
where
they
wept
around
some
cherished
love
who
taken
a
letter
to
the
church
above
and
still
i
thought
as
my
eyes
soulward
turned
how
many
things
there
are
that
ca
be
burned
but
still
we
cling
and
cling
and
hate
to
part
with
the
place
where
we
found
them
on
the
start
a
sneerish
sort
of
fellow
stood
by
me
and
said
to
such
extent
as
i
can
see
when
churches
get
afire
by
night
or
day
the
lord
stands
still
and
lets
burn
away
if
this
is
his
abode
beyond
a
doubt
why
does
he
raise
his
hand
and
put
it
out
said
i
young
man
please
do
not
try
to
aid
with
your
advice
the
mighty
power
that
made
what
little
there
is
of
you
there
are
still
schemes
you
do
comprehend
and
never
will
you
talented
i
think
but
no
one
cares
to
have
you
help
the
lord
in
his
affairs
why
probably
right
where
that
church
has
stood
there
soon
be
built
another
twice
as
good
and
some
mean
tight
insurance
company
will
perhaps
be
made
to
pay
more
half
the
bill
the
lord
knows
in
these
scenes
when
to
rebuild
and
where
to
get
the
means
he
turned
away
his
head
exceeding
far
and
lit
a
little
bit
of
white
cigar
but
gave
to
such
extent
as
i
could
see
no
more
of
his
theology
to
me
i
none
too
good
but
when
men
jeer
and
flout
i
like
to
have
them
know
what
they
about
arthur
selwyn
when
prometheus
stole
the
flame
when
prometheus
stole
the
flame
did
he
know
what
with
it
came
did
he
look
afar
and
see
all
the
blessings
that
would
be
could
he
view
the
gentle
gloam
of
the
fireside
of
a
home
or
the
blaze
turning
evenings
into
days
where
encamped
with
quiet
zest
happy
children
toil
and
rest
did
he
view
the
parlor
gleam
or
the
palace
dream
see
the
torch
floating
glare
burn
its
way
through
walls
of
air
or
through
trace
earth
remotest
did
he
see
the
flags
of
steam
the
cities
flash
and
gleam
to
his
vision
like
a
star
did
the
gleam
afar
which
another
eye
should
be
to
the
traveller
of
the
sea
if
prometheus
tortured
bound
knew
the
blessings
man
had
found
then
his
sufferings
must
have
been
soothed
by
blessings
from
within
when
prometheus
stole
the
flame
did
he
know
what
with
it
came
did
he
see
the
fire
rise
and
take
its
midnight
meal
did
he
view
the
palace
wall
stumble
the
smoke
and
fall
did
he
see
some
cherished
home
feed
a
fiery
ocean
foam
did
he
hear
the
of
a
nation
called
to
arms
and
behold
men
in
their
ire
murdering
men
with
bolts
of
fire
did
some
miscreant
cross
his
sight
bent
on
booty
or
on
spite
stealing
steps
into
the
dark
with
the
incendiary
spark
did
there
faint
and
haggard
rise
ghosts
before
his
startled
eyes
godly
men
of
scathless
name
felled
for
fuel
to
the
flame
in
a
earthly
hell
thrown
for
voicing
heaven
too
well
if
he
knew
that
glittering
thing
would
to
earth
such
curses
bring
then
his
sufferings
may
have
been
edged
with
poison
from
within
farmer
harrington
march
somehow
the
fire
i
saw
not
long
ago
has
subsequently
chased
me
high
and
low
runs
back
and
forth
betwixt
my
head
and
heart
and
shows
no
disposition
to
depart
and
so
i
wandered
too
much
perhaps
and
got
acquainted
with
the
fireman
chaps
and
planted
good
cigars
where
they
would
seem
inclined
to
grow
up
helpful
to
my
scheme
i
never
smoke
but
travelling
near
and
far
there
few
things
help
one
like
a
good
cigar
when
safe
between
a
neighbor
teeth
is
hung
it
oils
his
ways
and
loosens
up
his
tongue
i
get
more
from
cigars
before
it
through
than
all
the
fellows
that
i
give
them
to
perhaps
they
should
not
smoke
but
if
they
will
my
method
helps
their
families
foot
the
bill
not
long
ago
a
sturdy
fireman
lad
who
smoked
up
every
last
cigar
i
had
unrolled
the
following
story
to
my
view
which
i
believe
conditionally
true
flash
the
fireman
story
flash
was
a
sorrel
an
run
on
number
three
not
much
stable
manners
an
average
horse
to
see
notional
in
his
methods
strong
in
loves
an
hates
not
very
much
respected
or
popular
his
mates
dull
an
moody
an
sleepy
an
off
on
quiet
days
full
o
turbulent
sour
looks
an
small
sarcastic
ways
scowled
an
bit
at
his
partner
an
banged
the
stable
floor
with
other
means
intended
to
designate
life
a
bore
illustration
he
begged
that
horse
pardon
upon
his
bended
knees
but
when
day
or
night
time
he
heard
the
ring
he
rush
for
his
place
in
the
harness
with
a
regular
tiger
spring
an
watch
with
nervous
shivers
the
clasp
of
buckle
an
band
until
was
plainly
evident
he
like
to
lend
a
hand
an
when
the
word
was
given
away
he
would
rush
an
tear
as
if
a
thousand
witches
was
rumplin
up
his
hair
an
craze
the
other
horses
with
his
magnetic
charm
till
every
sounded
a
regular
never
a
horse
a
jockey
would
notice
an
admire
like
flash
in
front
of
his
engine
to
a
fire
never
a
horse
so
lazy
so
dawdlin
an
so
slack
as
flash
upon
his
return
trip
the
engine
back
now
when
the
different
horses
gets
an
old
they
no
use
in
our
business
so
flash
was
finally
sold
to
quite
a
respectable
milkman
who
found
it
not
so
fine
one
o
god
creatures
outside
it
natural
line
seems
as
if
i
could
see
flash
along
here
now
feelin
that
he
was
simply
assistant
to
a
cow
but
sometimes
he
imagine
he
heard
the
din
an
jump
an
rear
for
a
season
before
they
could
hold
him
in
an
once
in
spite
o
his
master
he
strolled
in
us
chaps
to
talk
with
the
other
horses
of
former
fires
perhaps
whereat
the
milkman
kicked
him
whereat
us
boys
to
please
he
begged
that
horse
pardon
upon
his
bended
knees
but
one
day
for
a
big
fire
as
we
was
makin
a
dash
both
o
the
horses
we
had
on
somewhat
resemblin
flash
yellin
an
ringin
an
rushin
with
excellent
voice
an
heart
we
passed
the
poor
old
fellow
away
at
his
cart
if
ever
i
see
an
old
hoss
grow
upward
into
a
new
if
ever
i
see
a
milkman
whose
traps
behind
him
flew
was
that
old
hoss
an
racin
down
the
track
an
that
respectable
milkman
to
hold
him
back
away
he
rushed
like
a
cyclone
for
the
head
o
number
three
gained
the
lead
an
kept
it
an
steered
his
journey
free
dodgin
wagons
an
horses
an
still
on
the
keenest
silk
an
furnishin
all
that
neighborhood
with
good
respectable
milk
crowd
an
runnin
an
vainly
hollerin
whoa
milkman
bracin
an
sawin
with
never
a
bit
o
show
firemen
laughin
an
chucklin
an
shoutin
good
go
in
hoss
down
to
it
an
sweepin
along
like
sin
illustration
away
he
rushed
like
a
cyclone
for
the
head
three
finally
came
where
the
fire
was
halted
with
a
thud
sent
the
respectable
milkman
heels
over
head
in
mud
watched
till
he
see
the
engines
properly
workin
there
after
which
he
relinquished
all
interest
in
the
affair
moped
an
wilted
an
dawdled
faded
away
once
more
took
up
his
old
occupation
considerin
life
a
bore
laid
down
in
his
harness
an
sorry
i
am
to
say
the
milkman
he
had
drawn
there
took
his
dead
body
away
that
the
whole
o
my
story
i
seen
more
once
or
twice
that
poor
dead
animals
actions
is
full
o
human
advice
an
if
you
ask
what
flash
taught
i
simply
answer
then
that
poor
old
horse
was
a
symbol
of
some
intelligent
men
illustration
an
if
as
some
consider
there
animals
in
the
sky
i
think
the
poor
old
fellow
is
gettin
another
try
but
if
he
should
sniff
the
big
fire
that
plagues
the
abode
o
sin
it
take
the
strongest
angel
to
hold
the
old
fellow
in
march
speaking
of
fires
my
powers
of
language
fail
they
run
them
here
upon
so
large
a
scale
my
son
charles
sumner
who
is
in
europe
terms
ten
dollars
by
the
day
paid
strictly
in
advance
can
rhyme
somewhat
and
often
seems
to
me
to
touch
the
spot
and
light
the
truth
up
with
a
healthier
glare
and
make
it
for
his
being
there
but
in
such
furrows
human
nature
runs
that
old
men
are
good
critics
for
their
sons
he
used
to
rush
as
youngsters
often
will
to
every
fire
we
had
at
tompkins
hill
and
seemed
to
plan
less
how
to
put
them
out
than
to
get
something
new
to
write
about
he
struck
a
rhyme
i
think
is
over
bad
about
a
fire
our
little
village
had
or
city
for
that
town
took
city
airs
before
its
village
reached
repairs
i
found
a
copy
of
it
day
where
he
had
laid
it
carefully
away
to
keep
me
from
not
finding
it
he
meant
to
get
it
back
in
the
next
check
i
sent
cost
me
several
dollars
yet
i
fear
i
paste
the
fellow
nonsense
right
in
here
how
we
fought
the
fire
i
was
a
drowsy
night
on
tompkins
hill
the
very
leaves
of
the
trees
lay
still
the
world
was
slumbering
ocean
deep
and
even
the
stars
seemed
half
asleep
and
winked
and
blinked
at
the
roofs
below
as
yearning
for
morn
that
they
might
go
the
streets
as
stolid
and
still
did
lie
as
they
would
have
done
if
streets
could
die
the
sidewalks
stretched
as
quietly
prone
as
if
a
foot
they
had
never
known
and
not
a
cottage
within
the
town
but
looked
as
if
it
would
fain
lie
down
away
in
the
west
a
with
white
arms
drooping
and
bare
head
bowed
was
leaning
against
with
drowsy
eye
the
dark
blue
velveting
of
the
sky
and
that
was
the
plight
things
were
in
that
night
before
we
were
roused
the
foe
to
fight
the
foe
so
greedy
and
grand
and
bright
that
plagued
old
deacon
tompkins
ii
the
deacon
lay
on
his
first
wife
bed
his
second
wife
pillow
beneath
his
head
his
third
wife
coverlet
him
wide
his
fourth
wife
slumbering
by
his
side
the
parson
visioned
his
sunday
text
and
what
he
should
hurl
at
satan
next
the
doctor
a
drowsy
kept
still
studying
as
he
partly
slept
how
men
might
glutton
and
tope
and
fly
in
the
face
of
death
and
still
not
die
the
lawyer
dreamed
that
his
clients
meant
to
club
together
and
then
present
as
proof
that
their
faith
had
not
grown
dim
a
small
bright
silver
hatchet
to
him
the
laborer
such
sound
slumber
knew
he
had
a
dream
the
whole
night
through
the
ladies
dreamed
but
i
ca
say
well
what
is
they
dream
for
they
never
tell
in
short
such
a
general
drowsy
time
had
been
known
in
that
sleepy
clime
as
on
the
night
of
clamor
and
fright
we
were
roused
the
treacherous
foe
to
fight
the
foe
so
greedy
and
grand
and
bright
and
carrying
such
an
appetite
that
plagued
old
deacon
tompkins
iii
when
all
at
once
the
old
bell
which
had
a
voice
like
a
maniac
yell
cried
out
as
if
in
its
dim
old
sight
the
had
come
in
the
night
bang
whang
whang
bang
clang
dang
bang
whang
the
poor
old
parcel
of
metal
sang
whereat
from
mansion
cottage
and
shed
rose
men
and
women
as
from
the
dead
in
different
stages
of
attire
and
shouted
the
town
is
all
afire
which
came
as
near
to
being
true
as
some
more
leisurely
stories
do
they
saw
on
the
deacon
house
a
glare
and
everybody
hurried
there
and
such
a
lot
of
visitors
he
had
never
before
the
luck
to
see
the
deacon
received
these
guests
of
night
in
a
costume
very
simple
and
white
and
after
a
drowsy
scared
ahem
he
asked
them
what
he
could
do
for
them
fire
fire
they
shouted
your
house
afire
and
then
with
energy
sudden
and
dire
they
rushed
through
the
mansion
solitudes
and
helped
the
deacon
to
move
his
goods
and
that
was
the
sight
we
had
that
night
when
roused
by
the
people
who
saw
the
light
atop
of
the
cottage
cozy
and
white
where
lived
old
deacon
tompkins
illustration
how
we
fought
the
fire
iv
ah
me
the
way
that
they
rummaged
round
ah
me
the
startling
things
they
found
no
one
with
a
fair
idea
of
space
would
ever
have
thought
that
in
one
place
were
half
the
things
that
with
a
shout
these
neighborly
burglars
hustled
out
came
articles
that
the
deacon
wives
had
all
been
gathering
half
their
lives
came
furniture
such
as
one
might
see
did
grow
in
the
trunk
of
every
tree
a
tall
clock
centuries
old
was
said
leaped
out
of
a
window
heels
head
a
veteran
chair
in
which
when
new
george
washington
sat
for
a
minute
or
two
a
bedstead
strong
as
if
in
its
lap
old
time
might
take
his
terminal
nap
dishes
that
in
meals
long
agone
the
deacon
fathers
had
eaten
on
clothes
made
of
every
cut
and
hue
that
could
remember
when
they
were
new
a
mirror
scathless
many
a
day
was
promptly
smashed
in
the
regular
way
old
shoes
enough
if
properly
thrown
to
bring
good
luck
to
all
creatures
known
and
children
thirteen
more
or
less
in
varying
plenitude
of
dress
and
that
was
the
sight
we
had
that
night
when
roused
the
terrible
foe
to
fight
which
blazed
aloft
to
a
moderate
height
and
turned
the
cheeks
of
the
timid
white
including
deacon
tompkins
lo
where
the
engines
reeking
hot
dashed
up
to
the
interesting
spot
came
number
two
the
city
hope
propelled
by
a
line
of
men
and
rope
and
after
them
on
a
spiteful
run
the
ocean
billows
or
number
one
and
soon
the
two
induced
to
play
by
a
hundred
hands
were
working
away
until
to
the
deacon
flustered
sight
as
he
danced
about
in
his
robe
of
white
it
seemed
as
if
by
the
hand
of
fate
day
were
some
two
years
late
and
with
complete
though
late
success
had
just
arrived
by
the
night
express
the
ocean
billows
were
at
high
tide
and
flung
their
spray
upon
every
side
the
city
hope
were
in
perfect
trim
preventing
aught
like
an
interim
and
a
company
came
with
hooks
and
ropes
and
a
long
hard
name
and
with
an
iconoclastic
frown
were
about
to
pull
the
whole
thing
down
when
some
one
raised
the
assuring
shout
it
only
the
chimney
out
whereat
with
a
sense
of
injured
trust
the
crowd
went
home
in
complete
disgust
scarce
one
of
those
who
with
joyous
shout
assisted
the
deacon
in
moving
out
refrained
from
the
din
to
help
the
deacon
at
moving
in
and
that
was
the
plight
in
which
that
night
they
left
the
deacon
clad
in
white
who
felt
he
was
hardly
treated
right
and
used
some
words
in
the
flickering
light
not
orthodox
in
their
purport

still
the
flames
were
like
a
furnace
and
the
walls
were
crashing
loud
and
the
old
man
held
in
safety
fainted
the
trembling
crowd
and
the
mother
watched
and
wondered
with
her
great
eyes
scarcely
wet
but
half
dazed
amid
her
sorrow

rain
for

weeks
till
the

swims
and
all

leaks
and
furnish
still
less
room
to
spare
and
hackmen
several
times
have
earned
their

the
omnibuses
lumber
through

as
well
as

with

through
the

the

past

scene
as
brisk
as

though
not
so
clean
what

the
city
keeps
for

are
shedding
tears
as
if
their
hearts
would
break
and
water
tries
to
get
by
storming
steady
that
fourth
of
all
the
world
it
has
already
and
men
are
not
so
sweet
as
men
could
wish
in

that
would
offend
a
moderate
fish
few
places
can
be
found
outside
or
in
where
this
weather
has
not
been
for
man
has
always
striven
and
in
vain
to
roof
his
from
the
rain
i
strolled
about
this
morning
several
miles
men
who
get
their
living
by
their
smiles
i
set
my
old
umbrella
up
to
drip
in
places
where
i
claimed
relationship
or
rather
where
my
heart
did
and
that
more
than
blood
connection
is
sixteen
times
i
journeyed
up
and
down
through
half
broadway
and
did
not
see
a
smile
and
so
in
spite
of
all
that
i
can
do
these
spectacles
are
growing
blue
and
my
old
heart
must
bear
along
the
road
a
fanciful
but
rather
heavy
load
a
painful
pressure
from
a
hand
unseen
most
any
one
knows
nearly
what
i
mean
i
think
i
powder
up
this
day
by
going
to
hear
the
actors
play
they
make
me
laugh
and
tone
me
up
a
bit
and
get
me
out
of
this
unnatural
fit
got
back
alive
and
that
worth
thinking
on
from
where
there
been
such
lots
of
killing
done
mercy
it
was
a
somewhat
skittish
sight
so
many
people
butchered
in
one
night
was
just
a
lot
of
people
playing
crime
a
sort
of
all
the
time
we
found
the
theatre
with
handbills
spread
near
where
the
notice
in
the
paper
said
the
weather
had
slacked
up
an
hour
or
so
and
wife
thought
she
would
condescend
to
go
and
after
stumbling
over
several
chaps
who
thought
they
met
us
somewhere
else
perhaps
and
cheerfully
addressed
us
and
as
if
they
known
us
several
years
or
more
persisting
in
affording
us
a
chance
to
buy
our
tickets
at
a
slight
advance
the
theatres
employ
these
men
i
heard
to
greet
their
patrons
with
a
friendly
word
and
light
their
way
in
with
kind
word
and
smile
and
make
a
dollar
out
of
them
meanwhile
we
brushed
past
these
remarkable
some
tickets
bought
and
scrambled
to
our
seats
after
a
piece
of
music
by
the
band
the
curtain
rose
before
a
castle
grand
and
soldiers
talking
with
a
mien
about
a
spook
that
one
of
them
had
seen
when
lo
this
ghost
appears
plump
to
their
view
and
will
not
talk
although
they
beg
him
to
i
whispered
to
my
wife
that
i
a
freak
that
a
newspaper
man
could
make
him
speak
but
suddenly
my
comments
had
to
cease
for
wife
encouraged
me
to
hold
my
peace
when
lo
this
ghost
who
thus
far
might
have
come
out
of
a
for
the
dumb
speaks
with
a
queer
but
rather
human
sound
when
once
his
son
the
prince
gets
on
the
ground
and
taking
him
aside
ten
feet
almost
tells
the
poor
boy
that
he
his
father
ghost
whose
own
false
brother
softly
to
him
crept
and
poured
him
full
of
poison
while
he
slept
then
the
young
man
got
mad
though
to
my
mind
was
lunacy
of
quite
a
knowing
kind
and
went
to
work
with
an
apparent
view
of
killing
off
every
one
he
knew
i
have
the
time
his
actions
all
to
state
i
only
say
he
managed
it
and
some
way
killed
all
relatives
he
saw
from
uncle
to
prospective
and
when
he
got
through
those
he
had
snuffed
out
were
hardly
worth
while
bothering
about
i
must
forget
to
say
that
this
poor
elf
became
at
last
a
good
square
corpse
himself
i
looked
around
and
the
whole
building
through
women
were
shedding
tears
as
if
was
true
and
wife
was
too
much
concerned
to
speak
and
even
my
old
eyes
had
sprung
a
leak
was
a
moist
time
and
i
remarked
is
plain
we
come
out
of
the
rain
into
the
rain
i
got
so
full
of
funeral
sitting
there
then
when
we
once
more
sniffed
the
clean
live
air
it
seemed
a
piece
of
all
around
to
get
away
once
more
alive
and
sound
that
what
they
call
a
tragedy
where
death
flies
till
he
himself
gets
out
of
breath
and
with
and
cold
poison
filled
all
who
amount
to
anything
get
killed
it
part
of
life
some
time
again
i
view
it
but
take
a
good
square
rest
before
i
do
it
arthur
selwyn
here
on
this
i
wander
why
of
the
storms
am
i
fonder
than
of
the
sunlight
above
them
and
the
clouds
why
do
i
love
them
waves
of
the
sky
onward
sweeping
or
to
the
leaping
why
do
i
court
this
fierce
day
dashing
my
face
full
of
spray
why
when
the
waves
strike
the
shore
with
their
strong
leonine
roar
does
my
soul
fiercely
entreat
them
rush
out
with
rapture
to
meet
them
why
do
i
love
to
descry
war
in
the
fields
of
the
sky
why
does
the
glare
ploughing
blue
meadows
of
air
look
to
my
vision
alway
sweet
as
a
star
in
the
day
you
who
in
fair
summer
weather
seek
this
together
built
for
tumultuous
rest
with
the
famed
ocean
chief
guest
not
half
the
pleasure
you
known
that
i
here
alone
on
these
wet
have
found
hearing
the
ocean
own
sound
viewing
fierce
waves
from
afar
strive
with
the
winter
in
war
storms
that
tumultuously
roll
far
through
my
innermost
soul
here
you
encounter
at
last
harmonies
wondrous
and
vast
what
did
i
find
on
the
shore
must
i
rehearse
it
once
more
the
dead
stowaway
he
lay
on
the
beach
just
out
of
the
reach
of
waves
that
had
cast
him
by
with
fingers
grim
they
reached
for
him
as
often
as
they
came
nigh
the
brown
had
a
surly
frown
and
glanced
at
the
dancing
sea
as
if
to
say
take
back
the
clay
you
tossed
this
morning
at
me
great
fragments
rude
by
the
shipwreck
strewed
had
found
by
this
wreck
a
place
he
had
grasped
them
tight
and
fright
sat
still
on
the
bloated
face
battered
and
bruised
forever
abused
he
lay
by
the
heartless
sea
as
if
heaven
aid
had
never
been
made
for
a
villain
such
as
he
the
fetter
mark
lay
heavy
and
dark
around
the
pulseless
wrists
the
hardened
scar
of
many
a
war
clung
yet
to
the
drooping
fists
the
soul
disgrace
across
that
face
had
built
an
iron
track
the
gash
of
the
jailman
lash
helped
cover
the
brawny
back
the
blood
that
flowed
in
a
crimson
road
from
a
deep
wound
in
his
head
had
felt
fierce
pangs
from
the
of
those
who
his
young
life
fed
cursed
from
the
very
beginning
with
deeds
that
others
had
done
more
sinned
against
than
sinning
and
so
is
every
one
he
had
never
learned
save
what
had
turned
the
steps
of
his
life
amiss
he
never
knew
a
true
or
the
thrill
of
a
virtuous
kiss
was
poured
like
a
flood
through
his
young
blood
and
poisoned
every
vein
that
wrong
is
right
that
law
is
spite
and
theft
but
honest
gain
the
seeds
were
grown
that
had
long
been
sown
by
the
heart
of
a
murderous
sire
disease
and
shame
and
blood
aflame
with
thirst
for
the
founts
of
fire
battered
and
bruised
forever
abused
he
lay
by
the
moaning
sea
as
if
heaven
aid
were
even
afraid
of
a
villain
such
as
he
as
he
lay
alone
like
a
sparrow
prone
an
angel
wandered
nigh
a
look
she
cast
over
that
dark
past
and
tears
came
to
her
eye
illustration
battered
and
bruised
forever
abused
he
lay
by
the
moaning
sea
she
bent
by
the
dead
and
tenderly
said
poor
child
you
went
astray
your
heart
and
mind
were

the

married
the

for
years
he
watched
and
waited
along

was

be
his

full
many
a

wooed
her
upon

oft

still
was

some

sprung

even

these
thoughts
grew
like
june
corn
the
other
day
as
i
through
coney
island
picked
my
way
and
found
there
pert
and
prosperous
as
could
be
a
city
by
the
sea
and
people
holding
in
free
easy
style
a
picnic
all
the
while
thousands
were
eating
there
amid
the
din
as
though
they
hardly
time
to
do
it
in
thousands
were
loitering
in
the
breezy
air
as
if
they
had
a
year
or
two
to
spare
and
every
trap
that
ever
caught
a
dime
was
ready
set
and
baited
all
the
time
the
ocean
to
my
unaccustomed
view
seemed
having
quite
a
lively
picnic
too
the
waves
came
slamming
at
us
with
a
roar
and
chased
each
other
to
the
shore
and
in
these
waves
and
adding
to
the
noise
a
lot
of
men
and
women
girls
and
boys
dressed
in
a
style
that
made
my
good
wife
frown
like
corks
went
bobbing
up
and
down
some
glided
out
and
in
like
some
rode
the
waves
on
their
backs
and
some
as
decent
folks
as
one
could
see
made
capers
that
were
very
queer
to
see
i
noticed
miss
dooz√©ll
much
versed
in
books
and
quite
particular
about
her
looks
and
dignified
as
any
one

know

thirteen
times

so

all

would
seem
to
say

indulges
in
unseemly
play
when
an
irreverent
wave
he
chanced
to
meet
stood
on
his
head
and
raised
aloft
his
feet
the
ocean
has
no
awe
for
any
one
and
always
seems
to
get
more
half
the
fun
but
how
the
pretty
children
carry
sail
each
with
his
tiny
shovel
and
his
pail
each
working
his
own
little
piece
of
land
and
making
small
plantations
in
the
sand
these
little
incidents
show
on
their
face
that
farming
natural
to
the
human
race
when
god
poor
pretty
ones
summer
blaze
have
lived
brick
and

all
their
days
trying
their
best
to
blossom
and
not
spoil
like
kidnapped
from
their
native
soil
it
must
be
heaven
to
sit
here
in
the
sand
and
take
old
mother
earth
right
by
the
hand
to
lie
here
by
no
brick
blocks
overlooked
and
take
a
breath
of
air
that
has
been
cooked
god
bless
you
children
a
long
time
be
before
the
sand
shall
cover
you
and
me
yes
every
trap
that
ever
caught
a
dime
is
ready
set
and
baited
all
the
time
here
nigh
the
shore
a
strange
machine
i
found
to
see
how
hard
with
beetles
men
could
pound
and
several
fellows
tried
it
and
who
never
handled
labor
so
before
and
would
have
shown
capacity
to
shirk
if
they
had
known
how
much
it
looked
like
work
here
round
and
round
i
saw
a
big
wheel
go
like
an
larger
though
and
worked
by
steam
and
on
the
sweeps
one
finds
big
wooden
animals
of
different
kinds
elephants
horses
birds
of
various
hues
lions
and
leopards
roosters
kangaroos
all
staring
with
great
stupid
wondering
eyes
and
all
about
the
very
size
and
on
these
beasts
sixteen
times
round
or
more
rode
children
of
from
fifty
down
to
four
while
some
filled
the
air
with
music
plenty
and
to
spare
here
a
big
premium
cow
quite
dead

gave

by
the
glass
here
were
some
great
museums
which
consisted
of
wondrous
things
that
never
have
existed

on
your
track
ready
to
draw
you
somewhere
else
and
back
here

as
you
onward

take
you

at

this

lifts
you
pretty
high
and
shows
you

yon

send
you
from
its
door

and
not
much
wiser
than
before
that
fellow
there
will
in
an
ocean

your
picture
take
and
swear
that
it
is
you
yes
every
trap
that
ever
caught
a
dime
is
ready
set
and
baited
all
the
time
and
sometimes
everything
seems
blurred
indeed
with
man
surprising
wickedness
and
greed
till
you
most
feel
there
nothing
genuine
there
excepting
ocean
waves
and
open
air
but
still
they
ca
put
all
god
plans
to
death
to
let
the
people
have
an
honest
breath
and
so
while
thinking
it
all
up
i
finally
felt
called
upon
to
say
thank
the
good
lord
from
whom
all
blessings
fall
for
making
coney
island
after
all
my
cousin
abdiel
stebbins
large
and
slow
arrived
at
ocean
grove
some
days
ago
he
stopped
off
in
this
city
on
the
way
and
stayed
here
with
us
two
weeks
and
one
day
for
we
keep
up
our
airy
home
in
town
whether
the
mercury
goes
up
or
down
not
liking
to
exchange
it
very
well
for
a
small
in
a
large
hotel
he
promised
that
the
first
hour
he
could
spare
he
write
us
how
he
liked
it
over
there
the
letter
like
himself
is
rather
queer
perhaps
i
better
paste
it
right
in
here

grove
dear
cousin
john
we
got
here
safe
my
worthy
wife
and
me
and
took
a
tent
here
in
the
woods
contigious
to
the
sea
we
harvested
such
means
of
grace
as
growed
within
our
reach
we
been
to
several
meetings
here
and
heard
the
bishop
preach
and
everything
went
easy
like
until
we
took
a
whim
my
wife
and
i
one
breezy
day
to
take
an
ocean
swim
we
should
have
ventured
o
i
think
if
sister
sunnyhopes
had
urged
us
over
and
again
and
said
she
knew
the
ropes
and
told
how
soothing
it
would
be
in
ocean
rills
to
lave
and
sport
within
the
bounding
surf
and
ride
the
crested
wave
and
so
we
went
along
with
her
my
timid
wife
and
me
two
inland
noodles
for
our
first
acquaintance
with
the
sea
they
put
me
in
a
rig
as
usually
is
done
a
wampus
and
short
overalls
all
sewed
up
into
one
i
had
to
pull
and
tug
and
shrink
to
make
the
thing
go
you
are
aware
my
peaceful
weight
will
crowd
three
hundred
pound
they
took
my
wig
and
laid
it
up
to
keep
it
dry
they
said
and
strapped
a
of
a
hat
on
my
devoted
head
they
put
my
wife
into
a
frock
too
short
by
full
a
third
was
somewhat
in
the
bloomer
style
i
told
her
was
absurd
you
know
she
rather
long
and
slim
somewhat
my
opposite
and
clothes
that
was
not
made
for
her
is
likely
not
to
fit
but
as
we
was
we
in
my
timid
wife
and
me
and
formed
our
first
acquaintance
with
the
inconsistent
sea
illustration
miss
sunnyhopes
she
waded
out
nice
and
sweet
she
had
her
dress
made
to
the
store
and
trimmed
from
head
to
feet
and
i
went
next
and
grabbed
their
rope
just
as
she
told
me
to
and
wife
came
third
scared
scarce
knowing
what
to
do
then
sister
sunnyhopes
a
smile
of
virgin
sweetness
gave
and
said
now
watch
your
chance
and
jump
here
comes
a
wave
i
must
have
jumped
i
rather
think
the
wrong
time
of
the
moon
at
any
rate
the
lovely
wave
occurred
to
me
too
soon
it
took
me
sudden
with
a
rude
and
unexpected
shock
i
rather
meet
the
stoutest
pair
of
horns
in
all
my
flock
and
then
to
top
the
circus
out
and
make
the
scene
more
fine
i
tried
to
this
lovely
wave
and
let
right
go
the
line
illustration
two
inland
noodles
for
our
first
acquaintance
with
the
sea
on
county
fairs
and
days
in
walking
through
a
crowd
i
rather
firm
to
jostle
perhaps
it
makes
me
proud
but
if
it
does
that
wave
just
preached
how
never
pays
and
seemed
to
say
how
small
is
man
no
odds
how
much
he
weighs
it
kicked
and
cuffed
me
all
about
in
spite
of
right
or
law
with
all
the
qualities
they
give
an
average
and
then
it
set
me
on
the
bank
quite
thankful
for
my
life
and
looking
i
give
a
gaze
to
find
my
faithful
wife
but
she
had
kind
o
cut
this
wave
with
all
the
edge
she
had
and
stood
for
me
uncommon
moist
and
sad
while
sister
sunnyhopes
with
smiles
was
looking
sweet
and
gay
on
her
dainty
back
some
several
rods
away
illustration
she
looked
so
newish
pretty
there
she
knowed
it
too
the
elf
the
crowd
was
all
admiring
her
and
so
was
i
myself
and
while
i
once
more
grasped
the
line
beside
my
wife
of
truth
my
eyes
rove
to
sister
her
beauty
and
her
youth
when
all
at
once
a
brindle
wave
uncommon
broad
and
deep
came
thrashing
down
on
wife
and
me
and
flopped
us
in
a
heap
illustration

heels
over
head
all
in
a
bunch
my
wife
across
of
me
and
i
on
some
misguided
folks
who
happened
there
to
be
my
hat
untied
and
floated
off
and
left
my
bald
head
bare
when
i
got
out
if
i
have
spoke
warmed
up
all
the
air
we
drank
of
the
sea
my
gasping
wife
and
i
while

still
floated
soft
at
the
sky

we
voted
that
we
had
enough
we
voted
that
we
had
enough
and
got
right
out
the
way
before
another
wave
arrived
and
bid
the
sea
we
looked
as
like
two
drownded
rats
as
ever
such
was
called
with
one
of
them
a
dumbed
old
fool
and
most
completely
bald

like
a

true
she
says
my
shivering
wife
to
me
we
will
not
mind
there
others
here
looks
just
as
bad
as
we
now
sister
sunnyhopes
came
back
into
our
tent
as
sleek
or
sleeker
than
before
and
asked
us
when
we
went
said
i
my
dear
good
sister
please
do
not
now
pretend
you
did
not
see
our
voyage
through
and
mark
its
doleful
end
if
you
would
play
the
mermaid
fair
why
such
i
have
you
be
but
we
too
old
to
take
that
part
my
faithful
wife

me
some
folks
may
be
who
ocean
waves
are
fitted
to
command
but
we
concluded
was
built
expressly
for
the
land
and
when
i
want
amusement
for
an
uncompleted
day
i
guess
i
go
and
take
it
in
some
good
way
and
will
not
stand
upon
my
head
all
the
folks
that
there
and
wildly
wave
my
dumbed
old
feet
in
all
the
neighboring
air
vice
farmer

ah
me
it
makes
a
sinner
wondrous
blue
to
see
so
many
other
sinners
too
when
i
rake
over
all
my
faults
and
then
notice
the
same
or
worse
in
other
men
it
makes
me
very
much
surprised
and
sad
that
heaven
should
see
earth
turning
out
so
bad

the
mean

some
villains
that
are
pretty
rough

town
where
art
and
nature
both
are
shoved
into
their
very
greatest
growth
and
where
the
utmost
of
all
things
is
found
the
devil
has
his

on
the

gives
them

never

old

must
be
large

yet
for
all
their
craft
in

how
brief
how
many
of
these
rascals
come
to
grief
for
though
within
them
cunning
may
abound
the
truth
is
always
standing
round
or
following
rogues
through
every
land
and
clime
and
gets
them
if
you
only
give
him
time
i
do
believe
as
some
good
people
say
the
devil
leads
men
on
from
day
to
day
and
takes
them
to
a
rock
and
first
they
know
pitches
them
off
into
some
gulf
below
or
baits
them
into
different
traps
and
then
does
try
at
all
to
get
them
out
again
i
think
he
like
to
keep
them
safe
and
sound
doing
his
nasty
work
the
whole
year
round
and
when
a
rogue
fails
up
and
comes
to
grief
it
hurts
his
but
helpless
chief
these
thoughts
limped
past
my
saddened
mind
as
through
state
prison
i
pursued
my
way
led
round
by
one
who
did
seem
to
be
knowing
what
melancholy
pictures
he
was
showing
those
walls
and
guards
that
all
escape
opposed
those
thick
iron
doors
it
thundered
when
they
closed
the
cells
each
one
a
closet
full
of
gloom
i
just
as
soon
sleep
in
a
metal
tomb
the
men
who
worked
away
no
doubt
for
fear
of
men
that
stood
about
wearing
that
garb
of
stripes
a
free
man
loathes
as
if
law
whipped
them
even
with
their
clothes
the
way
they
glance
up
at
you
from
within
their
drooping
eyelids
hard
with
grief
or
sin
wondering
as
they
gaze
upon
you
so
if
you
are
not
some
one
they
used
to
know
the
ghosts
you
feel
that
creep
all
the
time
among
these
men
who
shaken
hands
with
crime
the
mournful
hope
that
some
are
toiling
here
whose
innocence
in
heaven
is
proved
out
clear
all
these
things
to
my
inmost
spirit
talked
as
through
those
regions
dark
i
slowly
walked
and
when
the
front
door
closed
behind
me
free
the
fresh
air
seemed
like
heaven
itself
to
me
i
recollect
once
getting
sick
with
pain
when
sitting
near
a
sheriff
on
the
train
who
had
a
young
man
with
him
not
of
age
whom
he
was
taking
to
this
cage
the
poor
boy
talked
to
him
with
drooping
head
and
these
are
something
like
the
words
he
said
and
yet
was
quite
affecting
i
declare
how
some
had
ornaments
up
even
there
not
crime
itself
or
sad
misfortune
smart
can
crush
all
sense
of
beauty
from
the
heart
the
boy
convict
story
i
rather
sit
here
sheriff
up
near
to
the
end
of
the
car
we
wo
do
so
much
advertising
if
we
stay
in
the
seat
where
we
are
that
sweet
little
dude
saw
the
bracelets
that
you
on
my
wrists
have
bestowed
and
tells
the
new
passengers
promptly
you
taking
me
over
the
road
i
had
a
trial
the
neighbors
all
know
of
my
fall
but
when
i
get
out
among
strangers
i
after
all
for
i
was
a
lad
of
good
prospects
some
three
or
four
summers
ago
there
was
any
boy
in
our
township
who
made
a
more
promising
show
i
learned
all
of
solomon
proverbs
and
took
in
their
goodness
and
worth
till
i
felt
like
a
barrel
of
the
salt
of
the
earth
and
this
precious
picnic
of
sorrow
would
likely
enough
have
been
saved
if
i
had
had
less
of
a
heart
sir
or
home
had
contained
what
it
craved
for
the
time
when
a
boy
is
in
danger
of
walking
a
little
bit
wild
is
when
he
too
young
to
be
married
too
old
to
be
known
as
a
child
a
bird
in
the
lonely
grass
thickets
just
out
of
the
parent
tree
thrown
too
large
to
be
kept
in
the
old
nest
too
small
to
have
one
of
his
own
when
desolate
his
companions
his
soul
is
a
stake
to
be
won
is
then
that
the
devil
stands
ready
to
get
a
good
chance
to
catch
on
oh
yes
i
a
good
enough
home
sir
so
far
as
the
house
was
concerned
my
parents
were
providers
i
ate
full
as
much
as
i
earned
my
clothes
were
all
built
of
good
timber
and
fit
every
day
to
be
seen
there
was
any
lock
on
the
pantry
my
bedroom
was
tidy
and
clean
and
taking
the
home
up
and
down
sir
i
more
than
an
average
part
with
one
quite
important
exception
was
any
room
for
my
the
house
could
have
been
any
colder
with
in
every
room
the
house
need
have
been
any
darker
to
make
a
respectable
tomb
i
used
to
stop
short
on
the
and
brace
up
a
minute
or
more
and
bid
a
to
the
sunshine
before
i
would
open
the
door
i
used
to
feed
daily
on
icebergs
take
in
all
the
freeze
i
could
hold
then
go
out
and
warm
in
the
sunshine
because
my
poor
heart
was
so
cold
and
had
i
a
father
and
mother
oh
yes
just
as
good
as
they
make
good
i
have
often
suspected
though
maybe
that
last
a
mistake
but
they
travelled
so
long
and
so
steady
the
way
to
perfection
abode
they
had
any
feeling
for
fellows
who
could
not
as
yet
find
the
road
and
so
till
some
far
advanced
on
goodness
pike
i
could
win
they
thought
of
me
not
as
their
own
child
but
as
one
of
the
children
of
sin
and
had
i
brothers
and
sisters
oh
yes
till
they
somewhat
had
grown
then
shivering
they
went
off
and
left
me
to
stand
the
cold
weather
alone
for
i
had
the
luck
to
be
youngest
the
last
on
the
family
page
the
one
to
prop
up
the
old
the
staff
of
my
parents
old
age
who
well
understood
all
the
uses
to
which
a
mere
staff
is
applied
they
used
me
whenever
convenient
then
carelessly
threw
me
aside
and
had
i
any
associates
oh
yes
i
had
friends
more
or
less
but
seldom
i
asked
them
to
visit
our
house
with
the
slightest
success
whenever
the
project
was
mentioned
they
somehow
look
blue
like
and
chill
and
mention
another
engagement
they
felt
it
their
duty
to
fill
for
now
i
am
only
a
convict
there
no
harm
in
telling
the
truth
my
home
was
a
fearful
wet
blanket
to
blood
that
was
seasoned
with
youth
not
one
bless√®d
thing
that
was
cheerful
no
festivals
frolics
or
games
no
novels
of
any
description
was
wicked
to
mention
their
names
my
suddenly
vanished
my
never
would
keep
no
newspaper
came
through
doorway
unless
it
was
first
put
to
sleep
and
as
for
love
well
that
old
song
sir
is
very
melodious
and
fine
with
no
place
like
home
in
the
chorus
i
hope
there
ai
many
like
mine
and
so
soon
my
body
got
hating
a
place
which
my
soul
abide
and
pleasure
was
all
the
time
smiling
and
motioning
me
to
her
side
and
when
i
start
out
on
a
journey
i
likely
to
go
it
by
leaps
for
good
or
for
bad
i
no
i
one
or
the
other
for
keeps
my
wild
oats
flew
thicker
and
faster
i
reaped
the
same
crop
that
i
sowed
and
now
i
am
going
to
market
i
taking
it
over
the
road
yes
it
grieved
my
good
father
and
mother
to
see
me
so
sadly
astray
they
deeply
regretted
my
downfall
in
a
strictly
respectable
way
they
gave
me
some
more
admonition
and
sent
me
off
full
of
advice
and
wondered
to
see
such
a
villain
from
parents
so
good
and
precise
indeed
i
have
often
conjectured
when
full
of
neglect
and
its
smarts
i
must
have
been
left
on
the
of
their
uncongenial
hearts
my
home
in
the
prison
is
waiting
it
opens
up
clear
to
my
sight
hard
work
and
no
a
close
cell
to
sleep
in
at
night
and
there
i
must
lie
sad
and
lonesome
with
more
tribulation
than
rest
and
wake
in
the
morning
with
sorrow
sharp
sticking
like
steel
in
my
breast
but
maybe
the
strain
and
the
trouble
wo
quite
so
much
me
prevail
as
be
to
some
one
who
was
brought
up
in
a
kind
of
a
jail
got
a
good
home
sheriff
with
everything
cosy
and
nice
and
is
for
a
convict
to
offer
words
of
advice
but
this
i
say
of
all
places
your
children
may
visit
or
call
make
home
the
most
pleasant
and
happy
the
sweetest
and
best
of
them
all
for
the
devil
wo
offer
a
dollar
to
have
his
improved
when
home
is
turned
into
a
with
half
the
attractions
removed
think
i
too
bitter
good
sheriff
i
like
you
you
been
very
good
i
ever
and
ever
so
grateful
would
pay
it
all
back
if
i
could
i
did
mean
to
slander
my
parents
i
nothing
against
their
good
name
and
as
for
my
unrighteous
actions
it
mostly
myself
that
to
blame
still
i
had
a
but
the
prison
is
only
one
station
ahead
i
done
sheriff
forget
me
but
forget
what
i
have
said
september
vice
vice
vice
vice
and
is
all
clear
and
free
where
any
one
can
take
a
look
and
see
and
then
decide
immediate
on
the
spot
whether
he
buy
his
there
or
not
it
scattered
round
about
so
the
good
folks
ca
entirely
shun
it
when
they
would
much
better
to
escape
it
we
be
able
if
was
obliged
to
carry
a
label
it
always
does
some
time
before
it
ages
but
not
enough
so
in
its
early
stages
my
mind
was
led
around
about
this
way
by
a
young
man
i
met
who
strove
to
twist
some
money
out
of
me
but
had
instead
a
lecture
free
my
cousin
abdiel
stebbins
large
and
good
inclined
to
do
even
better
than
he
should
and
with
a
heart
that
gets
him
into
scrapes
of
a
most
strange
variety
of
shapes
but
who
before
they
run
a
fatal
course
always
gets
out
of
them
by
sheer
main
force
wrote
me
two
letters
several
years
ago
which
i
have
kept
with
no
intent
to
show
but
simply
to
read
over
now
and
then
as
part
of
my
entitled
men
i
think
i
get
my
cousin
wail
by
letter
and
paste
it
here
where
i
can
find
it
better
farmer
stebbins
on
the
bowery
dear
cousin
john
we
got
here
safe
my
worthy
wife
an
me
an
then
i
looked
the
village
through
to
see
what
i
could
see
i
rode
upon
the
track
with
stations
all
i
walked
through
wall
street
all
its
length
an
saw
no
bulls
or
bears
i
patronized
a
chap
with
manners
very
queer
who
had
had
a
thing
to
eat
for
somethin
like
a
year
i
saw
the
road
commissioners
to
work
upon
a
bridge
a
million
times
as
large
as
that
we
built
at
tompkins
ridge
i
told
that
they
are
makin
it
though
maybe
that
all
fun
to
use
the
coming
century
an
hope
to
get
it
done
when
who
should
up
an
grasp
my
hand
with
face
of
genuine
joy
but
cousin
jeroboam
jones
my
cousin
oldest
boy
i
had
not
seen
him
years
an
years
no
wonder
he
looked
strange
his
face
an
form
in
some
respects
had
undergone
a
change
but
then
there
was
a
chance
of
doubt
that
that
was
him
because
if
not
how
should
he
ever
know
that
i
was
who
i
was
we
brushed
our
old
acquaintance
up
an
soon
was
at
our
ease
a
wanderin
all
about
the
place
as
cozy
as
you
please
it
nicer
far
in
foreign
towns
than
is
to
be
alone
to
walk
with
one
whose
blood
proceeds
from
sources
near
your
own
a
of
heart
a
sort
of
family
ease
enables
you
to
work
your
tongue
as
as
you
please
and
so
i
found
myself
quite
soon
uncommonly
at
home
describin
all
my
business
through
to
cousin
jerobo
he
listened
very
docile
like
an
had
much
to
say
but
what
he
did
was
in
a
way
he
severed
somewhat
from
his
kin
an
sort
o
lost
the
run
but
he
recalled
the
stebbinses
when
mentioned
one
by
one
an
takin
him
inside
an
out
our
family
scarcely
owns
a
relative
more
relishin
than
jeroboam
jones
he
teacher
in
a
he
told
me
by
the
way
which
has
a
room
above
a
store
that
open
every
day
for
if
he
says
we
come
across
a
child
that
needs
our
care
we
can
not
wait
till
sunday
comes
we
join
then
an
there
an
if
you
want
to
see
the
way
our
worthy
cause
is
run
come
in
an
take
a
little
look
our
just
begun
the
scholars
had
come
as
yet
the
superintendent
though
was
sittin
at
a
table
like
an
bowed
extremely
low
an
heard
the
praise
on
poor
old
me
my
cousin
had
to
tell
an
said
he
joyed
to
meet
a
friend
of
one
he
loved
so
well
an
i
talked
back
an
for
a
time
our
converse
did
not
cease
a
regular
gush
of
friendship
love
an
peace
an
then
he
showed
me
how
they
run
their
an
all
such
we
have
the
same
at
home
you
know
although
not
near
so
much
an
then
he
had
some
on
numbers
that
you
saw
with
figures
in
envelopes
to
draw
i
gin
him
fifty
cents
to
help
a
cause
i
dearly
hold
an
drew
a
velvet
with
a
clasp
resemblin
gold
my
cousin
pressed
my
hand
with
some
congratulatin
jokes
and
said
ah
me
the
stebbinses
was
always
lucky
folks
but
after
all
their
is
the
thing
that
lets
them
win
which
made
me
proud
though
i
did
see
just
where
the
shrewd
came
in
but
buyin
a
book
at
that
price
an
helpin
of
the
cause
meanwhile
was
unsuspected
nice
illustration
to
make
four
hundred
dollars
clear
an
help
the
children
too
whereat
the
superintendent
said
you
lucky
i
allow
i
have
to
charge
five
dollars
for
a
chance
to
draw
here
now
whereat
my
cousin
jeroboam
remarked
if
is
wrong
i
buy
a
draw
for
cousin
steb
to
help
the
cause
along
i
shook
my
head
but
he
an
sure
as
i
alive
i
drawed
a
good
bill
for
cousin
jones
five
whereat
the
superintendent
said
you
lucky
men
i
vow
a
hundred
dollars
i
must
charge
for
every
drawing
now
an
fingerin
the
envelopes
one
opened
just
a
grain
and
i
discerned
the
number
uncommon
black
and
plain
an
on
the
number
by
glancin
i
could
see
five
good
crisp
bills
there
for
me
illustration
we
come
part
of
one
of
it
to
make
four
hundred
dollars
clear
an
help
the
children
too
was
somethin
that
would
surely
seem
desirable
to
do
with
an
unfailin
eagle
eye
a
heart
that
swelled
with
hope
i
watched
an
saw
the
very
place
he
put
that
envelope
i
winked
at
cousin
jeroboam
i
counted
out
the
cash
an
drawed
an
had
that
card
revealed
almost
as
quick
as
flash
oh
sakes
the
second
figure
i
had
what
i
had
seen
a
that
made
a
of
it
was
number
an
on
them
figures
on
the
board
there
nothin
was
in
fact
except
a
little
pamphlet
like
an
tract
which
had
any
money
wuth
an
wo
be
good
for
much
except
to
keep
my
older
boys
from
playin
cards
an
such
now
cousin
jeroboam
jones
was
buried
in
surprise
an
walked
a
half
a
mile
with
me
an
helped
philosophize
an
says
you
come
some
other
day
we
try
that
thing
agin
we
come
of
one
of
the
next
time
we
shall
win
then
nearin
to
a
corner
he
took
kindly
leave
o
me
because
of
some
new
scholars
there
that
he
must
go
an
see
i
give
you
this
experience
john
but
please
do
tell
it
now
let
tompkins
take
the
chestnut
horse
an
sell
the
brindle
cow
an
gather
up
what
cash
besides
i
have
loose
an
send
the
whole
of
it
to
me
for
my
immediate
use
do
everything
concerned
in
this
in
soft
secretive
tones
direct
it
to
new
york
in
care
of
jeroboam
jones
a
few
days
and
the
following
one
arrived
which
shows
sin
triumph
sometimes
is
farmer
stebbins
ahead
dear
cousin
john
i
very
glad
you
sent
that
money
through
by
cousin
seth
an
not
by
mail
as
i
requested
you
the
just
so
much
ahead
best
it
never
came
if
jeroboam
jones
had
twined
his
fingers
the
same
for
that
young
man
has
principles
fit
only
to
abhor
and
is
the
kind
of
relative
that
i
was
lookin
for
my
sakes
millennium
nowhere
near
when
men
so
false
can
be
as
to
equivocate
themselves
into
my
family
tree
an
on
its
honest
branches
graft
the
shoots
of
their
design
an
make
me
think
they
good
because
they
relatives
of
mine
while
under
those
fraternal
smiles
a
robber
frown
is
hid
but
that
the
inappropriate
thing
that
jeroboam
did
when
cousin
seth
the
tavern
reached
whose
clerk
me
he
cried
where
is
my
son
i
come
so
far
to
see
an
so
to
fill
that
father
heart
with
resurrected
joy
i
twisted
with
him
a
bit
to
try
an
find
the
boy
an
comin
where
i
had
the
luck
that
for
to
win
i
opened
quietly
the
door
an
both
of
us
went
in
the
superintendent
still
was
there
he
gave
a
little
start
but
welcomed
us
apparently
with
overflowin
heart
an
told
us
all
about
the
work
an
how
was
gettin
on
an
how
much
money
those
who
gave
unto
the
cause
had
won
but
cousin
seth
though
much
impressed
with
what
he
heard
an
saw
said
he
did
fix
the
envelopes
an
he
would
draw
just
then
the
door
was
opened
quick
an
with
a
solemn
grin
young
jeroboam
jones
appeared
an
sidled
softly
in
an
with
him
was
an
older
man
who
looked
enough
like
me
to
been
a
stebbins
too
so
far
as
one
could
see
but
slappin
seth
upon
the
back
i
said
my
duty
done
for
this
is
jeroboam
jones
your
oldest
son
my
oldest
son
said
he
he
as
much
my
son
as
you
are
the
belov√®d
babe
of
washington
it
strikes
me
that
my
married
life
was
very
much
amiss
if
i
responsible
for
such
a
sneakin
face
as
this
he
blinded
you
by
his
supposed
relationship
to
me
he
no
one
i
have
ever
seen
or
ever
want
to
see
as
when
a
fog
above
a
field
the
sudden
breezes
tore
you
spied
a
thousand
things
you
did
not
even
miss
before
so
all
the
facts
of
this
affair
as
clear
as
summer
skies
straightway
arranged
themselves
before
my
reconstructed
eyes
that
these
were
not
veracious
men
an
this
no
an
naught
was
what
it
seemed
except
one
old
fool
i
held
those
two
deceivers
out
with
unassisted
strength
an
by
the
collar
shook
each
one
to
my
arm
farthest
length
they
gasped
an
danced
an
skipped
around
without
a
word
to
say
they
put
their
heads
together
in
a
new
an
painful
way
due
ninety
dollars
fifty
cents
an
not
a
penny
less
i
shouted
an
i
send
you
back
your
by
express
when
finally
in
my
discourse
a
breathin
pause
occurred
the
superintendent
counted
out
the
cash
without
a
word
which
with
a
manner
dignified
i
coldly
repossessed
an
still
retainin
jeroboam
that
scamp
i
thus
addressed
an
so
you
are
the
bogus
friend
and
relative
so
free
to
spend
his
time
fools
of
poor
old
men
like
me
i
supervisor
of
the
town
where
i
have
lived
so
long

ai
a

in

that
part
will
say
i
done

wrong

ai
a
man
will
claim
but
what
i
ordinary
keen
but
when
i
plant
myself
in

grow

an
any
man
who
acts
a
civil
part
can
always
find
my
soul
to
home
an
in
my
heart
it
sad
for
such
a
smile
as
yours
to
find
so
mean
a
fate
an
there
good
in
you
at
least
enough
to
use
for
bait
without
kindness
in
your
heart
you
could
have
landed
me
an
as
to
how
you
used
your
gifts
just
pause
a
bit
an
see
i
gambled
by
you
callin
it
a
charitable
name
and
my
sunk
with
unaccustomed
shame
i
done
what
i
have
whipped
my
boys
for
even
lookin
at

do
suppose
but
what
i
own
part
of
the
blame
for
that
i
thought
i
saw
a
chance
to
make
five
dollars
out
o
one
which
with
strict
justice
all
around
is
very
seldom
done
but
up
to
that
outrageous
point
remember
i
was
led
by
your

an
several

you
said

my

said

we
talked

together
it
seemed

if
some
of
our
old
farm
weather
had
got
tired
of
the
sober
hills
of
brown
hitched
up
a
cloud
and
driven
into
town
we
went
to
church
and
heard
a
sermon
preached
which
all
the
way
from
earth
to
heaven
reached
and
lifted
us
up
toward
the
town

till
we
could
almost
see
the
steeples
shine
and
hear
the
mighty
chariots
as
they
rolled
along
the
massive
turnpikes
made
of

we
had
some
music
so
and
true
it
made
me
think
of
every
flower
i
knew
and
when
with
benediction
the
old
pastor
said
for
himself
but
not
his
master
it
put
my
resolution
to
the
rack
to
head
my
poor
old
tears
and
drive
them
back
we
tried
to
come
straight
out
as
christians
should
and
bring
away
all
of
it
that
we
could
but
there
were
certain
persons
there
who
after
church
was
over
clogged
the
way
and
standing
with
worldly
nods
and
smiles
held
a
reception
in
the
aisles

to
bring
down
out

them
with

both
and
he
who
saves
his
from

is

hired

and
does
not
toil
in

but
i
reminded
by
the
bell
for
dinner
that
i
no
preacher
but
a
poor
old
sinner
unable
even
to
follow
my
own
view
much
less
to
counsel
others
how
to
do
i
ca
even
eat
when
i
come
right
down
to
it
without
a
bell
to
tell
me
when
to
do
it
so
i
will
cork
my
sermon
snub
my
muse
and
go
with

and
learn
the
news
arthur
selwyn
more
ways
than
one
i
was
present
one
day
where
both
layman
and
priest
worshipped
god
in
a
way
that
was
startling
at
least
over
thirty
in
place
on
the
stage
in
a
row
as
is
often
the
case
at
a
minstrelsy
show
in
a
uniform
clad
was
each
one
of
them
seen
and
a
banjo
they
had
and
a
loud
tambourine
and
they
sung
and
they
shouted
their
spasmodic
joys
just
as
if
they
doubted
that
god
loved
a
noise
and
their
phrases
though
all
not
deficient
in
points
a
grammarian
would
call
rather
weak
in
the
joints
and
the
aspirate
sound
was
adroitly
misused
and
the
language
all
round
was
assaulted
and
bruised
while
the
tunes
that
they
sung
in
bewildering
throngs
had
been
married
when
young
to
hilarious
songs
and
the
folks
in
that
place
who
this
loud
racket
made
were
not
bounded
by
race
or
condition
or
shade
now
i
love
my
own
meeting
my
own
cosy
pew
while
mentally
greeting
friends
quietly
true
and
the
gospel
dispensed
with
a
dignified
grace
born
of
reason
and
a
faith
firm
of
place
i
love
the
trained
voices
that
float
down
the
aisles
till
the
whole
church
rejoices
with
god
sweetest
smiles
have
no
sneer
understood
for
the
rest
when
i
say
i
had
rather
get
good
in
a
civilized
way
so
this
meeting
had
grated
somewhat
on
my
heart
and
ere
long
i
had
waited
i
thought
to
depart
but
a
young
man
arose
looking
and
grim
as
if
of
woes
had
descended
on
him
no
such
face
you
discern
in
a
leisurely
search
if
you
took
a
chance
turn
through
a
civilized
church
but
his
words
though
not
choice
to
my
feelings
came
nigh
there
was
growth
in
his
voice
there
was
hope
in
his
eye
and
he
said
i
a
lad
with
a
life
full
of
blame
every
step
has
been
bad
every
hour
was
a
shame
and
for
drink
i
would
pawn
all
within
my
control
from
the
clothes
i
had
on
to
my
heart
and
my
soul
i
have
drank
the
foul
stuff
in
my
parents
hot
tears
i
have
done
crime
enough
for
a
hundred
black
years
but
i
came
to
this
place
for
the
help
that
i
craved
i
have
seen
jesus
face
and
i
know
i
am
saved
then
a
man
rose
to
view
when
this
youngster
was
done
and
he
said
this
is
true
that
young
man
is
my
son
he
was
drunk
every
day
and
such
terror
would
make
that
i
spurned
him
away
from
my
house
like
a
snake
we
have
suffered
the
worst
that
can
come
from
he
is
sober
the
first
i
have
seen
him
for
years
i
am
full
of
such
joy
as
i
never
yet
knew
and
now
robert
my
boy
home
is
open
to
you
you
may
go
home
with
me
or
may
run
on
before
you
a
glittering
key
that
will
open
the
door
your
mother
is
there
praying
for
you
now
there
is
snow
in
her
hair
there
is
pain
on
her
brow
and
when
you
have
kissed
her
the
way
there
a
brother
and
sister
who
longed
for
this
day
and
whatever
can
befriend
you
on
earth
shall
be
done
may
god
blessing
attend
you
my
son
oh
my
son
then
the
banjo
struck
in
and
the
tambourine
jingled
there
rose
such
a
din
that
my
blood
fairly
tingled
the
vocalists
screamed
till
quite
red
in
the
face
but
somehow
it
all
seemed
not
at
all
out
of
place
now
denouements
immense
do
riot
somehow
take
hold

travel
farmer
harrington
november
it
quite
the
thing
to
travel
nowadays
although
i
do
not
think
it
pays
and
see
if
distant
ground
in
general
looks
as
mentioned
in
the
papers
and
in
books
i
find
in
sifting
what
few
facts
i
know
three
ways
of
realizing
things
are
so
first
when
you
told
them
in
such
trusty
shape
that
square
belief
is
easy
to
escape
there
lots
of
people
this
town
would
hold
them
who
do
know
much
excepting
what
is
told
them
second
what
you
put
on
some
mental
shelf
by
having
seen
and
understood
yourself
how
well
we
know
things
witnessed
largely
lies
on
how
much
brain
there
is
behind
our
eyes
the
third
way
is
the
surest
and
the
best
though
sometimes
painful
it
must
be
confessed
it
where
a
truth
has
whipped
the
earth
with
you
until
you
from
head
to
foot
is
true
i
think
sometimes
when
all
is
said
and
done
feeling
is
all
the
senses
joined
in
one
going
to
travel
not
so
very
far
as
our
new
friends
the
fitzcumnoodles
are
who
can
not
read
their
social
title
clear
unless
they
ride
twelve
thousand
miles
a
year
i
told
them
with
a
philosophic
smile
that
travelling
should
be
measured
by
the
mile
but
we
shall
take
a
little
trip
with
some
spare
time
that
wife
contrived
to
borrow
to
where
george
washington
laid
out
a
town
that
several
centuries
wo
see
tumbled
down
a
city
which
with
all
the
sneaking
sinners
that
come
down
there
to
steal
their
daily
dinners
and
all
the
human
insects
hovering
nigh
such
as
swarm
thick
wherever
good
things
lie
and
spite
of
all
the
bad
weeds
growing
round
has
always
good
folks
upon
the
ground
and
will
be
of
the
greatest
nation
that
ever
helped
spruce
up
the
lord
plantation
the
fitzcumnoodles
through
their
daughter
maud
inform
us
that
we
ought
to
go
abroad
the
clancdenancies
we
have
lately
learned
from
an
extended
trip
have
just
returned
and
so
my
eldest
daughter
isabel
who
knows
miss
clanc
very
well
called
on
her
in
the
progress
of
a
walk
and
had
a
pleasant
little
and
after
coming
home
misspent
her
time
in
putting
what
she
heard
there
into
rhyme
and
lost
it
not
by
accident
i
fear
i
paste
the
conversation
right
in
here
her
tour
yes
we
been
travelling
my
dear
three
months
or
such
a
matter
and
it
a
blessing
to
get
clear
of
all
the
clash
and
clatter
ah
when
i
look
the
through
and
see
each
queer
place
in
there
is
hard
to
make
it
seem
quite
true
that
i
myself
have
been
there
our
voyage
oh
of
course
was
gay
delightful
splendid
glorious
we
spurned
the
shore
we
sped
away
we
rode
the
waves
victorious
the
first
mate
mustache
was
so
grand
the
ocean
sweet
though
stormy
i
was
so
sick
i
could
not
stand
but
papa
saw
it
for
me
at
queenstown
we
saw
land
once
more
ground
never
looked
so
pretty
we
took
a
near
the
shore
for
some
city
a
very
ordinary
stone
we
had
to
kiss
at
blarney
the
beggars
would
let
us
alone
that
at
killarney
the
giants
causeway
is
arranged
with
no
regard
to
science
it
must
somehow
of
late
have
changed
at
least
we
saw
no
giants
some
little
funny
scrubs
of
folks
sold
pictures
and
were
merry
the
men
were
full
of
yarns
and
jokes
the
women
barefoot
very
old
scotland
yes
all
in
our
power
we
did
there
to
be
thorough
we
stopped
in
glasgow
one
whole
hour
then
straight
to
at
abbotsford
we
made
a
stay
of
half
an
hour
precisely
the
ruins
all
along
the
way
were
ruined
very
nicely
we
did
a
mountain
in
the
rain
and
left
the
others
undone
then
took
the
flying
scotchman
train
and
came
by
night
to
london
long
tunnels
somewhere
on
the
line
made
sound
and
darkness
deeper
no
english
scenery
is
not
fine
viewed
from
a
pullman
sleeper
oh
paris
paris
paris
is
no
wonder
dear
that
you
go
so
far
into
the
ecstasies
about
that
victor
hugo
he
paints
the
city
high
and
low
with
faithful
pen
and
ready
i
think
my
dear
i
ought
to
know
we
drove
there
two
hours
steady
through
switzerland
by
train
yes
i
enjoyed
it
in
a
measure
but
still
the
mountains
are
too
high
to
see
with
any
pleasure
their
tops
they
made
my
neck
quite
stiff
just
stretching
up
to
view
them
and
folks
are
very
foolish
if
they
clamber
clear
up
to
them
rome
venice
naples
and
the
rhine
we
did
them
do
not
doubt
it
this
here
is
very
fine
tell
you
all
about
it
we
saved
up
asia
till
next
year
if
business
gets
unravelled
what
going
come
again
and
dear
i
will
not
seem
so
travelled
washington
travelling
and
we
here
and
what
a
town
i
own
it
picks
me
up
and
sets
me
down
i
thought
i
had
some
idea
of
the
place
and
what
its
corporation
lines
embrace
i
read
the
county
papers
every
week
which
seldom
failed
from
washington
to
speak
i
travelled
through
these
streets
by
photograph
and
with
imagination
for
a
staff
had
wandered
round
in
little
trips
disjointed
even
where
the
artist
brass
gun
has
not
pointed
and
so
i
said
though
i
would
like
to
miss
it
be
a
good
deal
like
a
second
visit
but
is
an
easy
perpetrated
scheme
to
prophesy
how
anything
will
seem
this
city
new
to
me
i
do
not
doubt
it
as
if
i
never
heard
a
word
about
it
there
something
in
these
buildings
glare
and
something
even
in
the
very
air
and
in
the
great
variety
of
faces
bearing
the
of
a
thousand
places
and
in
that
monument
that
reaches
high
the
farthest
stone
has
climbed
into
the
sky
and
in
that
dome
whose
kingly
size
and
height
contrive
you
are
to
keep
in
sight
from
these
and
several
hundred
other
things
this
nation
city
at
you
flings
you
feel
as
if
you
stepped
through
many
a
mile
into
another
planet
for
a
while
but
men
too
weary
to
hold
up
their
heads
are
apt
to
bless
the
man
who
first
made
beds
then
having
found
one
and
reclined
within
it
forget
about
him
in
just
half
a
minute
so
i
let
morpheus
who
is
at
me
winking
do
the
remainder
of
this
evening
thinking
or
woman
let
due
praise
to
her
be
paid
a
bed
is
never
made
until
is
arthur
selwyn
at
the
summit
of
the
washington
monument
look
north
a
city
fills
this
valley
to
its
sloping
hills
here
gleams
the
modest
house
of
white
the
statesman
dizzy
height
beyond
a
pledge
of
love
to
one
who
in
two
lands
was
freedom
son
the
holder
of
an
endless
debt
our
nation
brother
lafayette
but
yonder
lines
of
costly
homes
and
bristling
spires
and
swelling
domes
and
far
away
the
spreading
farms
where
thrift
displays
substantial
charms
and
hamlets
creeping
out
of
sight
and
cities
full
of
wealth
and
might
must
own
the
fatherhood
of
him
whose
glory
time
can
never
dim
all
who
can
reckon
freedom
worth
would
write
across
this
whole
broad
earth
with
pen
dipped
in
the
golden
sun
the
magic
name
of
washington
if
we
can
keep
the
rules
he
gave
this
land
he
more
than
fought
to
save
our
future
fame
will
glisten
forth
grand
as
the
north
illustration
from
the
monument
look
south
where
in
its
coat
of
gray
the
broad
potomac
creeps
away
and
seeks
the
blue
of
distant
skies
but
pauses
where
the
great
chief
lies
within
his
humble
hallowed
tomb
amid
mount
vernon
deathless
bloom
as
glides
this
stream
great
corse
past
thee
first
to
the
bay
and
then
the
sea
so
flowed
thy
life
to
rural
rest
ere
thou
wast
heaven
eternal
guest
oh
strong
high
man
whose
patriot
heart
climbed
from
all
common
greeds
apart
to
whom
men
selfish
ways
were
small
as
from
this
tower
serenely
tall
built
that
all
years
thy
fame
may
know
men
look
while
creeping
there
below
how
weak
was
power
to
thy
clear
gaze
builder
of
nations
joined
in
one
kindler
of
splendors
still
to
blaze
finder
of
glories
just
begun
live
on
great
sleeper
as
this
stone
highest
from
earth
that
man
has
known
so
shall
be
ranked
thy
solid
worth
highest
of
heroes
on
the
earth
happy
secure
and
cherished
name
love
is
the
pillar
of
thy
fame
thy
praise
comes
from
each
patriot
mouth
warm
as
the
sunbeams
of
the
south
look
east
the
nation
castle
walls
spread
out
in
massive
beauty
now
their
lofty
dome
and
pictured
halls
in
homage
to
this
summit

oh
well
that
from
these
palaced
lands
the
marble
spire
obeisance
win
but
for
the
one
for
whom
it
stands
this
had
never
been
yon
plot
so
full
of
brain
and
will
had
staid
a
bleak
and
lonely
hill
if
at
five
thousand
dizzy
feet
this
shaft
the
whirling
clouds
could
meet
until
our
gaze
for
miles
might
be
to
the
uncrowned
but
royal
sea
not
too
much
of
honor
then
to
grant
our
crownless
king
of
men
you
who
the
nation
laws
indite
look
to
this
summit
honest
white
where
throned
on
walls
that
must
endure
pure
fame
entreats
you
to
be
pure
until
our
glory
be
increased
like
sunbeams
from
the
dazzling
east
look
west
there
lie
the
hilly
fields
where
brothers
fought
through
days
of
dread
where
mothers
brooded
their
dead
and
soil
the
thrift
of
carnage
yields
where
cannon
roared
and
bullets
sung
till
every
hillock
had
a
tongue
o
nation
being
and
to
be
that
silent
blood
speaks
loud
to
thee
god
grant
if
our
guns
again
must
tear
the
quivering
flesh
of
men
the
leaden
may
be
pressed
against
some
foul
invader
breast
against
some
alien
tribe
and
zone
and
not
as
then
to
kill
our
own
may
all
the
fruitful
strifes
of
peace
the
thrilling
bonds
of
love
increase

yonder
orb
in
his
quick
change
from
mountain

valley
from

from

yonder
sun
one

count
and
only
one
until
he
dips
his
fiery
crest
into
the
ocean
of
the
west

up
the
phantom
clouds
of
gray
grim
ghosts
of
storm
have
passed
away
the
veiling
of
the
sky
is
done
and
downward
shines
the
welcome
sun
he
kindles
grand
and
peaceful
fires
upon
the
city
domes
and
spires
he
sends
his
strong
magnetic
glow
through
yonder
moving
throngs
below
thou
art
o
sky
serene
and
clear
a
symbol
of
our
country
here
what
land
in
all
this
world
of
pain
this
earth
where
millions
toil
in
vain
where
famine
pestilence
and
strife
play
careless
games
with
human
life
where
superstition
clouds
the
soul
and
heartless
brains
sad
hearts
control

country
framed
in
frost
or
flowers
can
see
so
clear

ours
peace
throws

mantle
broad

who
peaceable
will
be
plenty
her
sheltering
flag

those
who
will
but

and
save
enlightenment
each
day
shall
rise
for
all
who
do
not
cloud
their
eyes

liberty
from
every
race
has
made
this
land

let
our
deep
thanks
forever
fly
far
as
the
reaches

farmer
harrington
november
went
to
mount
vernon
and
i
would
have
lost
that
trip
for
fifteen
hundred
times
its
cost
those
sleeping
in
the
autumn
sun
the
house
he
slept
in
when
his
work
was
done
the
trees
he
planted
with
his
own
brave
hand
that
set
out
freedom
trees
all
the
land
the
humble
tomb
he
lies
in
which
like
me
pilgrims
from
all
the
world
have
come
to
see
these
look
up
in
one
eyes
and
sadly
smile
and
preach
a
funeral
sermon
all
the
while
even
the
upon
their
way
toll
bells
as
if
he
died
that
very
day
and
through
it
all
this
precept
may
be
traced
the
noblest
men
are
simplest
in
their
taste
i
read
how
grand
napoleon
tomb
is
made
and
all
the
to
him
paid
but
i
do
think
the
people
that
come
there
bring
any
heartfelt
sympathy
to
spare
while
every
patriot
night
and
morn
thanks
god
for
letting
washington
be
born
while
i
was
standing
hat
off
at
the
tomb
a
youth
approached
made
of
bloom
and
with
his
hat
perched
on
his
head
and
smoking
a
small
white
cigar
he
said
sirrh
would
you
kindly
just
enlighten
me
as
to
where
gawge
cut
down
the
said
i
young
man
just
please
at
once
disgorge
the
of
calling
that
man
his
body
mind
and
soul
were
firmly
set
higher
no
doubt
than
you
will
ever
get
he
is
the
man
though
lying
dead
is
true
when
friends
are
near
to
be
by
you
take
off
your
hat
and
bow
if
you
rebel
i
get
a
cherry
switch
and
trounce
you
well
he
looked
at
me
a
moment
in
surprise
and
mutiny
stood
foremost
in
his
eyes
but
i
was
quite
indignant
and
could
feel
the
blood
of
bunker
hill
all
through
me
steal
i
said
one
minute
more
will
be
allowed
the
fine
young
man
took
off
his
hat
and
bowed
irreverence
is
the
fashion
nowadays
and
shows
itself
in
good
and
evil
ways
its
mission
is
legitimate
and
clear
in
cases
where
there
nothing
to
revere
but
they
who
use
it
must
be
and
not
get
reverend
and
unreverend
arthur
selwyn
through
these
broad
streets
do
i
fly
furlongs
and
miles
i
defy
till
the
magnificent
distance
vanishes
out
of
existence
let
me
with
pencil
prolong
strains
of
the
bicycler
song
the
silent
wheel
good
pedestrian
i
glad
to
see
you
out
the
day
is
full
of
healthfulness
the
birds
are
all
about
there
is
a
quiet
breeziness
in
all
the
pleasant
air
i
hope
this
happy
exercise
will
drive
away
your
care
for
i
am
a
pedestrian
a
very
good
pedestrian
and
all
the
glowing
benefit
of
walking
i
can
share
although
i
tread
the
atmosphere
and
do
not
touch
the
ground
i
greet
you
as
a
brother
sir
wherever
you
are
bound
but
my
impatient
in
yonder
town
doth
wait
i
wish
you
better
company
and
strike
a
swifter
gait
good
equestrian
a
noble
steed
you
ride
i
do
not
seem
to
frighten
him
so
here
is
by
your
side
it
is
a
feast
of
happiness
to
smoothly
bound
along
with
sturdy
muscles
under
you
and
footing
swift
and
strong
for
i
am
an
equestrian
a
very
fair
equestrian
with
bugle
blast
of
melody
and
unassuming
song
and
all
the
thrilling
ecstacy
of
horsemanship
i
feel
although
the
nag
i
ride
upon
was
bred
of
burnished
steel
but
his
impatience
urges
me
to
swifter
gait
than
you
and
so
i
wish
you
pleasure
sir
and
bid
a
kind
adieu
racer
you
a
trotter
that
is
fine
i
never
would
disparage
him
or
say
too
much
of
mine
your
horse
is
full
of
mettle
sir
and
bravely
draws
his
load
it
must
be
pure
deliciousness
to
speed
him
on
the
road
but
i
am
quite
a
racing
man
a
modest
humble
racing
man
though
small
is
my
solicitude
upon
the
turf
bestowed
and
if
you
have
anxiety
to
try
a
little
race
i
undertake
with
courtesy
to
give
you
second
place
but
if
the
first
you
take
from
me
and
it
be
fairly
earned
i
hope
that
on
some
future
day
the
tables
may
be
turned
carriageer
you
have
an
easy
ride
those
cushions
are
luxurious
and
pleasantly
you
glide
is
very
good
and
fortunate
if
one
be
tired
or
ill
to
calmly
call
his
carriage
out
and
travel
as
he
will
but
i
sir
keep
my
carriage
too
a
very
pleasant
carriage
too
though
it
is
not
the
easy
one
that
desire
would
fill
it
carries
me
in
comfort
over
many
a
pleasant
mile
and
all
my
best
acquaintances
are
suited
with
its
style
is
with
a
blithe
economy
establishments
are
run
with
driver
footman
passenger
and
horses
all
in
one
fellow
wheelmen
here
a
warm
fraternal
hand
as
with
a
rush
of
victory
we
sweep
across
the
land
if
some
may
be
dissatisfied
to
view
the
way
we
ride
we
only
wish
their
majesties
could
wander
by
our
side
for
we
are
good
philanthropists
unqualified
philanthropists
and
would
not
have
happiness
to
any
one
denied
we
claim
a
great
utility
that
daily
must
increase
we
claim
for
inactivity
a
bright
and
grand
release
a
constant
mental
physical
and
moral
help
we
feel
which
makes
us
turn
enthusiasts
and
bless
the
silent
wheel
farmer
harrington
november
it
quite
a
show
and
strikes
me
a
good
deal
how
many
ride
around
here
on
a
wheel
the
streets
are
graded
very
smooth
and
nice
and
make
this
town
the
wheelman
paradise
a
neighbor
once
to
me
who
down
here
like
myself
to
hear
and
see
told
me
last
night
before
we
doused
the
glim
how
a
young
got
the
start
of
him
skip
my
memory
maybe
if
i
let
it
i
put
it
down
here
so
i
forget
it
farmer
and
wheel
or
the
new
lochinvar
i
was
hoein
in
my
on
a
spring
day
just
at
noon
an
a
hearkin
in
my
stomach
for
the
tune
an
reflectin
when
my
daughter
should
be
married
be
best
she
should
take
josiah
baker
son
who
jines
me
on
the
west
an
consolidate
our
acres
into
one
immense
abode
when
my
hired
man
says
by
ginger
look
down
the
road
well
i
says
my
goodness
gracious
things
rather
overgrown
when
a
gets
loosened
an
goes
runnin
alone
but
my
man
he
says
by
mustard
as
the
critter
nearer
came
do
you
see
that
there
a
feller
on
of
the
same
an
it
as
nice
a
shaver
as
you
see
any
day
who
was
travellin
through
the
country
in
that
unexpected
way
he
was
rather
young
an
an
as
smilin
as
you
please
an
his
pants
they
signed
a
contract
with
his
stockin
at
the
knees
an
he
had
a
pair
o
treadles
underneath
his
seat
so
to
run
the
queer
contraption
by
of
his
feet
an
the
sun
descended
on
it
in
a
manner
warm
an
bright
was
as
as
a
circus
an
an
interestin
sight
when
as
fate
was
bound
to
have
it
on
that
quite
morn
there
was
somethin
was
the
matter
with
my
folks
ah
the
hired
girl
when
she
tried
to
could
blow
it
very
well
for
to
call
us
in
to
dinner
so
she
sent
my
daughter
belle
who
came
up
just
at
that
minute
nice
a
girl
as
could
be
found
an
this
fellow
looked
her
over
an
came
smashin
to
the
ground
smash
to
bang
he
came
wheel
an
stockin
pants
an
all
an
i
run
to
him
remarking
you
have
caught
a
dreadful
fall
an
my
daughter
hovered
round
him
tremblin
with
her
she
alarms
lookin
just
as
if
she
would
like
to
take
him
in
her
arms
but
he
glanced
up
faintly
smilin
an
he
replied
i
am
only
hurt
which
i
he
meant
inside
an
we
packed
him
on
the
an
then
drove
him
to
the
house
an
he
lay
there
on
the
sofa
still
an
quiet
as
a
mouse
an
he
would
not
have
a
doctor
but
he
called
my
daughter
belle
an
then
laughed
an
chatted
with
her
like
a
person
gettin
well
an
along
late
in
the
evenin
i
suppose
he
went
away
for
he
was
there
next
mornin
an
belle
had
a
word
to
say
an
he
left
two
silver
dollars
in
an
spot
for
to
pay
us
for
his
passage
on
the
like
as
not
an
was
quite
enough
equivalent
for
his
transitory
stay
but
he
might
have
left
us
still
he
carried
more
away
for
my
daughter
belle
grew
absent
glanced
at
every
sound
she
heard
and
josiah
baker
junior
could
get
a
civil
word
ii
i
was
workin
in
my
meadow
on
a
blazin
summer
day
when
my
by
contract
came
the
way
an
remarked
it
been
the
bargain
for
how
long
i
need
tell
that
these
two
farms
should
be
married
as
should
also
me
an
belle
an
how
much
the
indications
indicate
that
that
be
if
you
come
down
here
a
minute
you
will
have
a
chance
to
see
illustration
and
he
stood
there
like
a
colonel
with
her
trembling
on
his
arm
an
he
led
me
the
fallow
underneath
some
picnic
trees
where
my
gal
an
that
wheel
fellow
sat
as
cosy
as
you
please
an
she
put
some
flowers
an
ribbons
on
the
wheel
to
make
a
show
an
they
been
hands
there
an
forgotten
to
let
go
an
she
sort
o
made
a
of
the
fellow
other
arm
with
no
recollection
of
josiah
baker
farm
then
we
walked
around
front
of
an
i
says
your
very
fine
but
this
gal
that
you
are
courtin
is
josiah
gal
an
mine
you
a
mighty
breechy
critter
an
are
trespassin
all
round
why
this
very
grove
you
sit
in
is
josiah
father
ground
then
he
rose
up
stiff
an
civil
an
helped
belle
across
the
stile
also
put
the
masheen
over
with
a
queer
but
quiet
smile
an
he
stood
there
like
a
colonel
with
her
tremblin
on
his
arm
an
remarked
i
beg
your
pardon
if
i
done
you
any
harm
but
so
far
as
matters
i
relieved
you
of
that
load
since
the
place
i
now
am
standing
is
i
think
the
public
road
and
this
very
sweet
young
lady
you
in
one
sense
yours
may
call
but
she
mine
sir
in
another
and
josiah
not
at
all
i
escort
this
lady
home
sir
leave
my
wheel
here
in
your
care
and
come
back
in
fifteen
minutes
to
arrange
the
whole
affair
and
please
do
not
touch
the
is
as
yet
without
a
flaw
and
i
do
not
want
a
quarrel
with
my
future
if
this
baker
junior
follows
up
his
glances
though
with
his
fingers
i
will
thrash
him
till
he
thinks
his
cake
is
dough
then
he
left
us
both
suspectin
that
he
rather
got
the
start
an
the
acres
of
the
daddies
seemed
apart
an
we
did
wait
to
see
him
but
with
one
impatient
jerk
we
shook
our
heads
in
concert
an
went
back
unto
our
work
an
i
could
help
reflectin
he
is
steady
like
an
cool
an
that
wheel
may
be
a
folly
but
it
did
bring
a
fool
iii
i
was
on
my
stoop
on
a
hazy
autumn
day
rather
drowsy
from
a
dinner
that
had
just
been
stowed
away
and
regrettin
when
old
baker
an
my
homestead
jined
in
one
that
he
was
to
furnish
daughter
an
i
was
to
furnish
son
so
to
have
my
name
continued
of
letting
it
go
down
when
josiah
baker
junior
came
a
drivin
home
from
town
an
a
little
ways
behind
him
came
that
wheel
scamp
ridin
hard
an
they
both
to
once
alighted
an
come
walkin
through
the
yard
when
as
fate
was
bound
to
have
it
also
came
my
daughter
belle
from
a
visit
in
some
neighbor
lookin
very
sweet
an
well
an
they
stood
there
all
together
that
strange
dissimilar
three
an
remained
in
one
position
lookin
steady
down
at
me
then
josiah
spoke
up
loudly
in
a
kind
o
sudden
pet
if
this
gal
an
i
to
marry
it
is
time
the
day
was
set
for
that
feller
always
here
courtin
on
the
fly
an
they
say
she
rides
out
with
him
in
the
on
the
sly
father
give
us
board
an
victuals
you
can
give
her
land
an
dower
wherefore
if
she
wants
to
have
me
please
to
set
the
day
an
hour
then
the
wheel
scamp
spoke
up
quiet
but
as
if
the
words
he
meant
would
like
to
wed
your
daughter
an
have
come
for
your
consent
she
is
very
dear
to
me
sir
when
we
walk
or
when
we
ride
and
i
think
is
not
unwilling
to
become
my
cherished
bride
i
can
give
her
love
and
honor
and
i
ask
of
you
no
dower
wherefore
please
bestow
your
blessing
have
set
the
day
and
hour
then
i
might
have
told
my
daughter
that
now
could
have
the
floor
an
remarked
that
on
this
question
there
should
be
just
one
speech
more
but
i
rendered
my
decision
in
a
flame
of
righteous
rage
an
i
shouted
you
no
business
for
to
court
or
to
engage
this
gal
has
long
been
spoke
for
an
you
please
to
clamber
on
your
old
of
a
buggy
an
forevermore
be
gone
then
he
picked
up
belle
quite
sudden
an
made
swiftly
for
the
gate
an
i
formed
a
move
to
stop
but
was
most
perplexin
late
he
had
fixed
a
small
on
his
everlastin
wheel
so
that
she
could
ride
behind
him
clingin
him
a
good
deal
an
straight
down
the
beebe
turnpike
like
a
pair
o
birds
they
flew
towards
a
preacher
who
had
married
almost
every
one
he
knew
illustration
chasing
the
bicycle
stop
head
chase
catch
i
commanded
very
vexed
they
be
hustlin
off
our
daughters
on
a
streak
o
lightnin
next
an
we
took
josiah
wagon
an
his
old
gray
spavined
mare
an
proceeded
for
to
chase
with
no
extra
time
to
spare
an
josiah
whipped
an
shouted
it
was
such
a
dismal
pinch
an
kept
just
so
far
behind
but
we
could
gain
an
inch
down
the
turnpike
road
we
rattled
an
some
fellows
loudly
cried
go
it
baker
or
you
lose
her
ten
to
one
upon
the
bride
an
i
fumed
an
yelled
an
whistled
an
commanded
them
to
halt
an
the
fact
we
could
catch
was
josiah
baker
fault
but
he
murmured
i
am
makin
father
mare
into
a
wreck
just
to
see
my
gal
round
another
feller
neck
an
they
rushed
into
that
preacher
maybe
twenty
rods
ahead
an
before
i
reached
the
altar
all
their
was
said
an
i
smashed
in
wildly
just
as
they
was
lettin
go
o
han
an
remarked
in
tones
of
sternness
i
hereby
forbid
the
banns
while
josiah
baker
junior
close
behind
me
meekly
came
sayin
were
my
father
present
he
would
doubtless
do
the
same
but
they
turned
to
me
an
she
hangin
on
his
arm
an
he
said
i
beg
your
pardon
let
josiah
have
the
farm
we
accomplished
the
sweet
object
for
which
we
so
long
have
striven
and
as
usual
in
such
cases
are
prepared
to
be
forgiven
an
the
whole
thing
seemed
so
funny
when
i
thought
of
it
a
while
that
i
looked
both
all
over
an
then
blessed
with
a
smile
then
josiah
baker
junior
took
his
spavined
mare
for
home
an
was
difficult
decidin
which
indulged
the
most
in
foam
an
he
said
i
drive
alone
sir
if
the
same
you
do
not
mind
an
your
son
an
daughter
wheeler
maybe
take
you
up
behind
an
he
yelled
while
disappearing
with
a
large
smile
on
his
mouth
i
kin
git
a
gal
whose
father
jines
my
father
on
the
south
iv
i
was
workin
in
my
on
a
snowy
winter
day
an
reflectin
on
a
letter
that
had
lately
come
our
way
how
that
belle
had
every
blessin
that
a
married
gal
could
need
an
had
bought
her
two
twin
daughters
a
velocipede
when
the
thought
came
stealin
through
me
well
so
far
as
i
can
see
in
the
line
of
love
an
lovin
what
to
be
is
apt
to
be
november
went
into
congress
for
a
little
spell
where
everything
seemed
going
pretty
well
but
all
through
boyhood
day
i
heard
so
much
of
webster
and
of
clay
that
though
they
had
been
dead
for
many
a
year
i
thought
at
least
by
proxy
they
appear
it
was
a
disappointment
i
declare
daniel
or
henry
neither
one
was
there
new

got
back
from
several
cities

it
looks
as
if
the
things
we
seen
would
fill
ten

harrington
july
back
to
the
old
old
homestead
is
it
queer
but
stranger
things
than
that
have
happened
here
the
old
farm
after
giving
oil
by
stream
until
the
world
itself
would
almost
seem
about
to
lose
its
progress
smooth
and
true
and
creak
upon
its
axis
first
we
knew
closed
business
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
and
every
blessed
well
we
had
went
dry
then
all
the
that
my
neighbors
had
the
example
followed
be
it
good
or
bad
and
the
whole
region
round
here
high
and
low
so
full
of
wealth
a
few
short
months
ago
and
men
to
get
their
circumstances
oiled
is
now
poor
pretty
nearly
spoiled
the
little
town
a
mile
away
from
here
where
we
sold
eggs
and
butter
many
a
year
and
feared
the
neighbors
hens
might
and
glut
the
market
some
sad
saturday
from
a
few
folks
a
small
a
church
store
and

this
village
grew
to
be
within
a
year
a
town
of
fifteen
thousand
people
clear
it
had
its
banks
its
and
its
gas
and
other
wonders
cities
bring
to
pass
its
sold
for
twice
as
much
i
know
as
my
old
farm
was
worth
three
years
ago
but
the
town
did
not
grow
on
brain
or
soil
but
floated
on
a
hidden
sea
of
oil
which
ebbed
away
one
evening
on
the
sly
and
left
the
city
stranded
high
and
dry
and
now
the
place
is
crumbling
to
the
gaze
a
modern
ruin
in
these
modern
days
no
banks
no
no
hotels
in
town
the
mansions
have
been
burned
or
taken
down
it
shows
how
soon
all
greatness
is
unmade
when
once
it
gets
upon
the
grade
so
we
come
back
to
take
our
former
farm
fix
it
up
somehow
coax
back
its
old
charm
and
live
here
by
the
city
noise
unstirred
to
cogitate
on
what
we
seen
and
heard
while
living
in
a
bustle
and
a
brawl
that
sometimes
hardly
let
us
think
at
all
the
old
house
was
kept
whole
in
every
part
i
had
that
put
in
writing
on
the
start
and
though
the
farm
seems
very
much
as
though
an
earthquake
had
lived
here
a
year
or
so
we
mean
to
try
and
make
it
seem
some
week
more
as
it
did
before
it
sprung
a
leak
first
thing
i
said
when
home
began
to
fit
and
thus
afford
us
time
to
breathe
a
bit
we
been
out
to
the
city
now
my
dear
let
bring
a
small
part
of
the
city
here
i
going
on
this
very
day
to
send
for
several
children
such
as
need
a
friend
and
have
them
come
out
here
and
get
some
air
with
room
to
turn
around
and
some
to
spare
i
wrote
some
men
and
women
in
the
city
who
give
poor
children
help
as
well
as
pity
send
out
as
many
as
you
can
afford
and
every
one
shall
have
a
month
clean
board
and
carry
back
from
out
our
plenteous
store
enough
to
keep
himself
a
fortnight
more
the
first
night
that
we
sat
expecting
them
i
did
what
some
whole
families
would
condemn
i
moulded
up
my
feelings
into
rhyme
in
something
less
than
fifteen
minutes
time
then
voiced
it
to
whoever
would
come
near
i
put
the
imposition
right
in
here

carry
back
from

the
heart
has
its
refuge
unfailing

strong
where
the
cares
of
the
world
sign
a
partial
release
and
the
soul
can
lie
down

sweet
sleep

peace

mine

we
dig
out
affection
pure
gold
the
fire

we
warm
our
poor
hearts
when
they
cold
the
grand
tender
chorus
by
love
fingers
stirred
where
all
the
sweet
tones
of
the
are
heard
but
he
who
in
thy
praises
was
sweetest
and
best
who
wrote
that
great
song
full
of
soothing
and
rest
through
pleasures
and
palaces
though
we
may
roam
be
it
never
so
humble
there
no
place
like
home
he
who
in
a
moment
unfettered
by
art
let
that
heavenly
song
fly
from
the
nest
of
his
heart
he
wandered
the
earth
all
forgot
and
alone
and
till
he
died
had
a
home
of
his
own
he
wandered
the
earth
at
his
own
dreary
will
and
carried
his
great
heavy
heart
with
him
still
he
carried
his
great
heavy
heart
the
road
with
no
one
to
give
him
a
lift
with
his
load
and
wherever
he
went
with
his
lone
dreary
tread
he
found
that
his
sweet
song
had
flown
on
ahead
he
heard
its
grand
melodies
chimes
and
from
great
bands
that
played
at
the
palace
door
he
heard
its
soft
tones
through
the
cottages
creep
from
fond
mothers
singing
their
babies
to
sleep
but
he
wandered
the
earth
all
forgot
and
alone
and
till
in
heaven
had
a
home
of
his
own
of
course
be
it
said
to
the
poor
fellow
shame
there
was
no
one
on
earth
but
himself
he
could
blame
god
meant
when
he
made
this
world
cheerful
and
bright
then
looked
it
all
over
and
said
was
all
right
then
stole
adam
rib
while
he
lay
fast
asleep
and
when
he
awoke
gave
it
to
him
to
keep
he
meant
that
this
world
as
he
gazed
on
it
there
should
blossom
with
homes
rich
and
radiant
and
fair
that
his
chain
of
flung
from
heaven
glittering
dome
should
be
forged
into
links
and
each
link
be
a
home
illustration
he
heard
its
soft
tones
through
the
cottages
creep
from
fond
mothers
singing
their
babies
to
sleep
this
adam
and
eve
more
advantages
carried
than
any
couple
that
ever
was
married
they
a
nice
cozy
home
unencumbered
and
free
save
a
slight
reservation
on
one
little
tree
they
toiled
not
and
sweat
not
in
tilling
their
lands
their
orchards
were
trimmed
by
invisible
hands
they
were
bothered
by
no
tailors
bills
their
bills
were
quite
moderate
too
no
each
year
their
scared
domicile
haunted
to
find
out
how
much
more
they
owned
than
they
wanted
in
sooth
this
young
pair
more
advantages
carried
than
any
couple
that
ever
was
married
and
if
when
eve
spied
that
large
serpent
one
day
she
had
acted
the
usual
feminine
way
and
piercingly
screamed
and
run
reckless
and
blind
as
if
satan
were
only
two
minutes
behind
then
adam
had
soothed
sweetly
her
fright
saying
what
do
you
fear
is
poison
bite
then
catching
a
club
he
had
towered
up
above
it
and
promptly
had
pounded
the
devil
out
of
it
have
saved
some
hot
tears
some
hard
toil
some
disgrace
and
been
a
great
thing
for
the
whole
human
race
but
they
treated
him
kindly
and
gave
him
his
say
and
was
not
very
long
ere
himself
was
to
pay
since
then
this
same
satan
whatever
befalls
is
noted
for
making
his
family
calls
some
families
shame
on
the
impudent
wretch
he
stays
with
at
times
for
a
week
at
a
stretch
and
some
it
would
seem
as
if
pleased
with
the
fare
he
had
taken
his
permanent
residence
there
but
when
to
his
dear
friends
these
visits
he
makes
he
does
always
come
in
the
persons
of
snakes
so
the
science
of
home
is
the
chiefest
of
all
to
ward
off
these
dangers
that
ever
befall

beat
back
these
