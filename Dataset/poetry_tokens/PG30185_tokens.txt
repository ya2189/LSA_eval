introduction
the
father
of
frederick
locker
lampson
or
frederick
locker
according
to
the
name
by
which
he
is
generally
known
was
edward
hawke
locker
at
one
time
commissioner
of
greenwich
hospital
he
is
described
in
the
of
national
as
man
of
varied
talents
and
accomplishments
fellow
of
the
royal
society
an
excellent
artist
in
a
charming
conversationalist
an
esteemed
friend
of
southey
and
frederick
the
author
of
lyrics
born
mr
augustine
birrell
his
writes
in
january
greenwich
hospital
in
after
divers
adventures
in
various
not
over
well
selected
schools
and
a
brief
experience
of
the
city
and
of
somerset
house
he
became
a
clerk
in
the
admiralty
serving
under
lord
haddington
sir
james
graham
and
sir
charles
wood
he
was
twice
to
lady
charlotte
bruce
a
daughter
of
lord
elgin
of
the
marbles
and
secondly
to
the
only
daughter
of
sir
curtis
lampson
of
rowfant
in
the
present
volume
is
earliest
literary
venture
produced
however
at
the
comparatively
mature
age
of
he
says
in
confidences
published
a
thin
of
song
called
subsequently
about
thackeray
who
was
then
editor
of
the
invited
locker
to
contribute
and
poems
published
there
and
elsewhere
were
collected
and
reprinted
from
time
to
time
the
original
title
being
always
retained
ten
editions
besides
some
selections
privately
printed
appeared
before
the
death
in
almost
all
something
new
was
added
in
all
something
old
was
taken
away
so
that
only
eight
of
the
pieces
composing
the
early
survive
in
the
issue
of
and
some
of
these
are
much
altered
it
is
hoped
that
readers
of
later
and
more
highly
finished
work
will
consider
a
republication
of
his
justified
by
the
interest
which
attaches
to
all
beginnings
so
many
people
even
now
confuse
minor
poetry
with
bad
poetry
that
it
is
almost
invidious
to
call
a
poet
minor
yet
there
is
no
doubt
that
minor
poetry
can
be
good
in
its
way
just
as
major
poetry
can
be
good
in
way
he
locker
was
a
minor
poet
he
was
at
least
why
a
master
of
the
instrument
he
touched
which
can
not
writes
mr
coulson
kernahan
in
the
for
october
said
of
all
who
would
be
accounted
locker
was
not
of
those
in
his
own
opinion
who
would
be
accounted
major
aim
he
says
humble
i
used
the
ordinary
metres
and
rhymes
the
simplest
language
and
ideas
i
hope
flavoured
with
an
individuality
i
strove
not
to
be
flat
and
above
all
not
to
be
it
is
not
necessary
to
prove
by
argument
and
illustration
that
locker
is
a
minor
poet
nor
that
he
belongs
to
that
honourable
company
of
writers
of
what
we
now
call
masters
of
which
are
after
all
among
the
and
herrick
his
place
in
that
company
is
not
so
easy
to
define
probably
he
stands
half
way
between
the
serious
succeed
by
virtue
of
grace
and
artistic
finish
yet
lack
the
touch
of
passion
the
indefinable
something
that
makes
the
bards
whose
primary
object
like
is
to
make
the
reader
laugh
elected
says
mr
coulson
kernahan
don
the
cap
and
bells
when
he
might
have
worn
the
singing
robes
of
the
a
description
of
one
who
chose
to
be
a
jester
when
he
might
have
been
serious
and
hardly
applicable
to
locker
who
is
never
a
professed
mr
kernahan
is
far
more
just
when
he
claims
for
a
kind
of
sober
gentleness
which
moves
neither
to
laugh
nor
to
weep
sad
scenes
may
touch
us
to
tender
melancholy
but
never
to
tears
his
gay
ones
to
smile
but
seldom
to
muse
is
not
the
muse
of
high
spirits
he
does
not
start
with
the
intention
of
jesting
he
is
the
gentle
and
serious
spectator
of
things
which
are
not
the
most
serious
in
a
sense
of
the
humorous
which
is
not
repressible
and
which
enters
into
all
his
reflections
but
which
he
never
allows
wholly
to
master
him
it
is
really
impossible
to
classify
poets
on
any
satisfactory
principle
every
good
poet
is
a
class
by
himself
but
if
the
attempt
must
be
made
one
may
say
that
the
author
of
belongs
to
that
school
of
which
the
other
chief
representatives
in
english
or
american
literature
have
been
praed
oliver
wendell
holmes
and
mr
austin
dobson
it
has
always
been
the
fashion
to
class
him
with
the
first
named
of
the
trio
as
a
writer
of
or
de
these
titles
like
other
parts
of
the
nomenclature
of
the
poetic
art
are
not
satisfying
why
written
verse
where
a
boudoir
decorum
is
or
ought
always
to
be
preserved
where
sentiment
never
surges
into
passion
and
where
humour
never
overflows
into
boisterous
should
be
conventionally
called
verse
or
verse
is
not
very
clear
to
write
is
to
be
the
laureate
of
the
cultured
leisured
upper
classes
but
some
poets
satisfy
the
above
himself
certainly
do
not
write
exclusively
of
or
for
then
again
what
is
many
serious
poems
are
inspired
by
the
transient
occasion
but
we
are
not
presumably
to
class
o
lord
thy
slaughtered
among
occasional
pieces
nor
is
sonnet
on
london
at
dawn
to
be
called
occasional
yet
the
source
of
it
the
fact
that
the
poet
happened
to
be
upon
westminster
bridge
in
the
early
morning
was
transient
not
apparently
inherent
in
the
nature
of
things
however
these
names
must
be
accepted
as
we
find
them
here
is
own
law
verse
he
says
be
short
graceful
refined
and
fanciful
not
seldom
distinguished
by
chastened
sentiment
and
often
playful
the
tone
should
not
be
pitched
high
it
should
be
terse
and
idiomatic
and
rather
in
the
conversational
key
the
rhythm
should
be
crisp
and
sparkling
and
the
rhyme
frequent
and
never
forced
while
the
entire
poem
should
be
marked
by
tasteful
moderation
high
finish
and
completeness
for
however
trivial
the
may
be
indeed
rather
in
proportion
to
its
triviality
subordination
to
the
rules
of
composition
and
perfection
of
execution
are
of
the
utmost
among
the
enviable
versifiers
who
can
satisfy
these
requirements
praed
and
locker
both
hold
a
high
place
praed
indeed
is
the
chief
among
writers
of
de
société
for
not
only
does
his
manner
conform
to
the
laws
laid
down
by
high
authorities
but
his
theme
is
generally
with
a
capital
says
locker
in
confidences
the
very
best
of
his
school
indeed
he
has
a
unique
position
for
in
his
narrower
vein
of
whimsical
wit
vernacular
banter
and
antithetical
rhetoric
which
may
correctly
be
called
de
in
its
most
perfected
form
and
its
exactest
sense
he
has
never
been
these
phrases
hit
off
praed
very
one
does
not
exactly
see
what
has
to
do
with
antithetical
rhetoric
these
two
poets
so
often
classed
together
are
not
really
very
much
alike
both
are
certainly
lighter
but
they
differ
apparently
in
temperament
and
certainly
in
method
no
one
would
deny
to
praed
the
gift
of
humour
but
the
period
in
which
he
wrote
was
one
which
admired
primarily
wit
and
while
it
would
be
too
much
to
say
that
his
heart
is
not
in
his
he
stands
detached
from
his
sympathies
are
indubitably
subordinated
to
the
effort
the
successful
effort
to
bring
off
a
neat
point
to
make
a
pun
in
the
right
place
to
be
striking
antithetical
epigrammatic
his
verses
have
the
finish
in
their
way
of
couplet
and
pentameter
his
best
known
and
most
praised
work
appeals
primarily
to
the
taste
and
the
ear
always
perhaps
to
the
head
rather
than
to
the
heart
there
is
something
of
in
praed
he
writes
for
effect
he
is
epideictic
of
course
this
is
one
object
of
writers
of
secret
to
jingle
and
scan
as
an
unduly
severe
critic
says
somewhere
one
need
hardly
say
that
this
is
not
sole
secret
but
technique
is
certainly
his
strong
point
are
my
friends
i
am
alone
no
playmate

beaker
some
lie
beneath

churchyard
stone
and

and
some

mill

pedantic
and

unscanned
beneath

this
is
the
art
which
does
not
conceal
itself
one
may
not
be
able
to
do
the
trick
but
it
is
possible
to
see
how
the
trick
is
done
one
says
locker
when
speaking
of
occasional
or
society
verse
fully
succeeded
who
did
not
possess
a
certain
gift
of
that
is
profoundly
true
a
writer
of
light
verse
who
has
not
an
ironical
habit
of
mind
had
better
change
his
purpose
and
write
an
epic
locker
has
his
full
share
of
the
necessary
gift
half
gay
half
melancholy
always
most
of
pain
and
some
of
is
in
certain
ways
the
appropriate
spokesman
of
a
society
like
our
own
which
is
really
most
natural
when
most
dissembling
or
dismissing
with
a
smile
its
deeper
emotions
there
is
nothing
about
locker
which
is
not
natural
as
he
is
so
apparently
does
he
speak
far
more
candidly
and
with
more
of
than
praed
more
candidly
than
mr
austin
dobson
who
is
apt
to
veil
his
personality
behind
a
mask
of
elegant
antiquarianism
but
locker
is
more
artless
and
naïve
which
qualities
are
in
him
not
the
least
inconsistent
with
irony
than
any
modern
writer
except
perhaps
stevenson
now
and
then
and
with
the
latter
itself
is
sometimes
an
artifice
mr
brander
matthews
rightly
lays
stress
on
this
aspect
of
poetry
and
directness
of
is
the
true
note
of
he
is
far
more
genuine
and
spontaneous
than
praed
it
is
difficult
and
perhaps
invidious
to
compare
the
two
as
it
may
be
that
vein
of
humour
is
larger
and
truer
than
the
earlier
praed
belongs
as
has
been
said
to
a
period
of
other
men
and
other
manners
probably
he
is
the
wittier
of
the
two
yet
this
might
be
contradicted
humour
has
the
reflective
vein
with
a
suggestion
of
pathos
of
the
great
writers
who
flourished
in
the
early
and
middle
victorian
era
we
are
perhaps
a
little
out
of
tune
now
with
the
sentiment
of
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
and
perhaps
too
with
but
humour
can
never
be
quite
out
of
fashion
readers
will
always
smile
not
laugh
at
or
pilgrims
of
pall
or
the
lines
my
her
bouquet
lace
farthingale

gay
if

be
true
what
a
lucky

were
you
grandpapa
what
funny
fancy
slips
from
atween
these
cherry
lips
whisper
me
fair
sorceress
in
paint
what
canon
says
i
marry
thee
but
perhaps
for
a
content
of
whimsical
lockerian
humour
the
gem
which
will
occur
to
most
is
the
delightful
reminiscence
of
infancy
recollect
a
nurse
ann
who
carried
me
about
the
grass
and
one
fine
day
a
fine
young
man
came
up
and
the
pretty
lass
she
did
not
make
the
least
objection
thinks
i
when
i
can
talk
tell
my
earliest
of
which
this
is
one
often
contain
his
most
characteristic
lines
praed
could
no
more
have
written
that
or
the
lines
my
grandmother
than
locker
could
have
written
both
poets
have
other
strings
more
serious
vein
could
win
a
contemporary
reputation
but
he
would
not
have
been
remembered
for
this
alone
after
eighty
years
in
her
window
which
mr
coulson
kernahan
rightly
calls
of
the
most
beautiful
of
the
century
locker
is
no
longer
ironical
but
rises
to
the
heights
of
real
passion
heart
we
come
again
where
my
love
reposes
this
is
these
are
mabel
will
be
anon
zoned
in
apparel
happy
zone
oh
hark
to
yon
carol
sing
thy
song
thou
trancèd
thrush
pipe
thy
best
thy
clearest
hush
her
lattice
moves
o
once
tried
says
locker
in
confidences
write
like
the
effort
was
not
wholly
successful
locker
is
weakest
where
his
manner
is
most
praedian
and
the
poet
either
realising
this
or
moulded
by
the
temper
of
his
time
appears
to
have
altered
most
of
the
obviously
imitative
passages
thus
in
the
last
stanza
runs
in
brought
this
wanderer
here
and
why
was
pamela
away
it
might
be
she
had
found
her
grave
or
he
had
found
her
but
the
antithetical
pun
is
excised
in
the
edition
where
the
lines
are
pilgrim
sees
an
empty
chair
where
pamela
once
sat
it
may
be
she
had
found
her
grave
it
might
be
worse
than
so
in
bank
of
early
violets
is
now
a
bank
of
mark
the
paronomasia
play
does
not
continue
to
please
the
taste
of
the
public
or
of
locker
himself
the
corresponding
stanza
in
the
poem
as
published
in
is
purified
of
such
tricks
these
alterations
are
characteristic
of
literary
method
he
was
keenly
critical
of
says
mr
birrell
mistake
good
verses
for
was
therefore
always
changing
and
polishing
his
work
adding
here
pruning
there
thus
only
eight
poems
from
the
volume
form
part
of
the
of
and
only
five
of
pilgrims
of
pall
mall
maintained
their
footing
throughout
in
all
intervening
editions
the
three
others
are
as
it
were
from
the
very
severely
edited
selection
of
the
variety
of
forms
under
which
his
verses
appear
at
different
periods
will
probably
make
the
works
a
happy
for
the
future
commentator
who
will
no
doubt
assign
this
as
he
will
probably
call
it
to
locker
that
to
lampson
that
again
to
the
lockeridae
or
the
lampsonschule
the
method
is
familiar
no
one
probably
ever
was
so
careful
of
the
took
we
are
told
pains
with
his
verses
always
aiming
at
a
more
perfect
finish
with
no
loss
of
that
naturalness
which
as
has
been
said
characterises
all
his
work
according
to
the
saying
quoted
by
matthew
arnold
of
joubert
he
de
perfection
to
him
implied
an
appearance
of
spontaneity
what
laboured
or
artificial
must
be
elaborated
till
it
it
was
in
thought
if
not
altogether
in
development
his
critical
sense
seems
to
have
grown
keener
with
his
interest
in
the
making
of
verses
was
a
great
student
of
verse
mr
birrell
says
and
a
student
especially
of
that
kind
of
verse
of
which
he
was
himself
one
of
the
masters
in
he
published
the
collection
elegantiarum
assisted
by
mr
kernahan
the
preface
written
by
locker
contains
some
excellent
rules
for
verse
from
which
the
selections
are
made
this
anthology
ranges
over
the
whole
field
of
english
poetry
and
like
everything
else
of
it
shows
the
man
charm
writes
the
collaborator
entirely
of
the
least
from
his
favourites
in
literature
one
may
make
a
very
fair
guess
at
some
part
of
his
character
so
too
kind
of
a
collection
of
miscellaneous
anecdotes
mostly
humorous
but
not
as
a
rule
broadly
or
farcically
his
delicate
and
subtle
perception
of
the
laughable
locker
married
lady
charlotte
bruce
in
and
soon
after
left
the
service
of
government
thenceforward
he
appears
to
have
led
a
very
placid
life
happy
in
his
family
seeing
much
of
his
large
circle
of
friends
devoted
to
poetry
and
was
published
in
in
in
locker
published
a
catalogue
of
what
he
called
the
collection
of
rare
and
valuable
books
mostly
the
poetry
of
the
fifteenth
and
sixteenth
centuries

mr
andrew

married

lampson
adding
her

name
to
his
own
the
rest
of
his
life
was
spent
for
the
most
part
at

he
died
there
may
his
autobiography
confidences
was
published
posthumously
in
the
castle
in
the
air
would
build
a
cloudy
house
for
my
thoughts
to
live
in
when
for
earth
too
fancy
loose
and
too
low
for
heaven
hush
i
talk
my
dream
alone
i
build
it
bright
to
see
i
build
it
on
the
cloud
to
which
i
look
with
thee
mrs
browning
you
shake
your
curls
and
ask
me
why
i
build
castles
in
the
sky
you
smile
and
you
are
thinking
too
nothing
else
on
earth
to
do
it
needs
my
dear
romantic
ware
to
raise
such
fabrics
in
the
ethereal
bricks
and
rainbow
beams
the
gossamer
of
dreams
and
much
the
architect
may
lack
who
labours
in
the
zodiac
to
rear
what
i
from
chime
to
chime
attempted
once
upon
a
time
my
castle
was
a
glad
retreat
with
bloom
and
scented
briars
a
model
with
all
that
such
a
seat
requires
a
rustic
thatch
a
purple
mountain
a
sweet
mysterious
haunted
fountain
a
terraced
lawn
a
summer
lake
by
sun
or
moonbeam
ever
and
then
my
cot
by
some
mistake
unlike
most
cots
was
neatly
a
porch
a
hall
a
hebe
laughing
from
the
wall
frail
vases
from
remote
cathay
while
under
arms
and
armour
in
trophied
guise
the
marble
a
peering
fawn
a
startled
fay
and
cabinets
with
gems
inlaid
the
legacy
of
parted
years
full
curtains
of
brocade
and
venice
lent
her
chandeliers
quaint
carvings
dark
and
light
meet
couches
for
the
sybarite
carpets
soft
as
down
the
last
new
novel
fresh
from
town
on
silken
cushion
rich
with
braid
a
shaggy
pet
from
skye
was
laid
and
drowsy
eyed
would
dosing
swing
a
parrot
in
his
golden
ring
all
these
i
saw
one
happy
day
and
more
than
now
i
care
to
name
here
lately
shut
that
workbox
lay
there
stood
your
own
embroidery
frame
and
over
this
piano
bent
a
form
from
some
pure
region
sent
her
dusky
tresses
lustrous
shone
in
massy
clusters
like
your
own
and
as
her
fingers
pressed
the
keys
how
strangely
they
resembled
these
yes
you
you
only
lady
fair
my
castle
in
the
air
and
life
without
the
least
foundation
became
a
charming
occupation
we
viewed
with
much
serene
disdain
the
smoke
and
scandal
of
cockaigne
its
dupes
and
dancers
knaves
and
nuns
by
blues
or
bored
by
duns
with
souls
released
from
earthly
tether
we
gazed
upon
the
moon
together
our
sympathy
from
night
to
noon
rose
crescent
with
that
crescent
moon
we
lived
and
loved
in
cloudless
climes
and
died
in
rhymes
a
thousand
times
yes
you
you
only
lady
fair
my
castle
in
the
air
now
tell
me
could
you
dwell
content
in
such
a
baseless
tenement
or
could
so
delicate
a
flower
exist
in
such
a
breezy
bower
because
if
you
settle
in
it
built
for
love
in
half
a
minute
love
you
ask
love
at
best
is
only
a
delightful
jest
as
sad
for
one
as
bad
for
three
so
suggest
you
jest
with
me
you
shake
your
head
and
wonder
why
a
denizen
of
dear
should
ever
condescend
to
try
and
build
her
castle
in
the
air
music
books
and
all
you
say
to
make
the
gravest
lady
gay
told
my
essays
show
research
my
sketches
have
a
church
partners
who
have
witty
parts
lovers
who
have
broken
hearts
quite
undisturbed
by
nerves
or
blues
my
doctor
gives
the
news
poor
polly
would
not
care
to
fly
and
wasp
you
know
was
born
in
skye
to
realise
your
might
jeopardise
a
giddy
pate
and
if
pride
apart
i
lost
my
head
or
you
your
heart
more
than
sorry
afraid
my
castle
is
already
made
and
is
this
all
we
gain
by
fancies
for
dreams
and
waking
trances
such
dreams
as
brought
poor
souls
mishap
when
was
fond
of
pap
and
still
will
cheat
with
feigning
joys
while
women
smile
and
men
are
boys
the
blooming
rose
conceals
an
asp
and
bliss
coquetting
flies
the
grasp
and
waking
up
snap
goes
the
slight
poor
cord
that
held
my
foolish
kite
your
slave
you
may
not
care
to
know
it
your
humble
slave
will
be
your
poet
farewell
aught
for
her
be
whose
every
wish
is
all
farewell
wishing
weave
a
spell
promise
in
those
words
well
i
wish
your
wish
may
not
be
now
wish
yourself
a
better
bard
the
cradle
aye
here
is
your
cradle
why
surely
my
jenny
such
slender
dimensions
go
somewhat
to
show
you
were
an
exceedingly
small
some
nineteen
or
twenty
short
summers
ago
your
in
a
channel
i
see
you
as
then
in
your
impotent
strife
a
tight
little
bundle
of
wailing
and
flannel
with
that
fardel
called
life
to
hint
at
an
infantine
a
scandal
all
are
somebody
knows
it
was
bliss
such
a
baby
to
dance
and
to
dandle
your
cheeks
were
so
rosy
your
toes
aye
here
is
your
cradle
and
hope
a
bright
spirit
with
love
now
is
watching
beside
it
i
know
they
guard
the
nest
you
yourself
did
inherit
some
nineteen
or
twenty
short
summers
ago
it
is
hope
gilds
the
future
love
welcomes
it
smiling
thus
wags
this
old
world
therefore
stay
not
to
ask
future
bids
fair
is
my
future
beguiling
if
still
it
pleases
then
raise
not
its
mask
is
life
a
poor
coil
some
would
gladly
be
doffing
he
is
riding
who
their
wrongs
will
adjust
for
at
most
a
footstep
from
cradle
to
coffin
from
a
spoonful
of
pap
to
a
mouthful
of
dust
then
smile
as
your
future
is
smiling
my
jenny
i
see
you
except
for
that
infantine
woe
scarce
changed
since
you
were
but
a
small
your
cheek
is
still
what
is
your
toe
aye
here
is
your
cradle
much
much
to
my
liking
though
nineteen
or
twenty
long
winters
have
sped
but
hark
as
talking
six
striking
it
is
time
baby
should
be
in
its
bed
o
tempora
mutantur
cruel
time
o
tyrant
time
whose
winter
all
the
streams
of
rhyme
the
flowing
waves
of
love
sublime
in
bitter
passage
freezes
i
only
see
the
scrambling
goat
the
lotos
on
the
water
float
while
an
old
shepherd
with
an
oat
pipes
to
the
autumn
mr

here
once
more
a
traveller
i
find
the
angel
inn

landlord
maids

receive
me
with

grin
they
surely
remember
my
hair
is
grey
and

so
since
i
was

the
not

since
that
sunny
month
of

which
brought
me
here
with
pamela

it
down
to
the
shape
of
this
decanter
since
been
both
much
put
tempora

aye
the
clock
and
reflecting
me
again
she
her
love
was
very
i
see
very
plain
and
that
daub
of
prince
leboo
fond
banter
to
fancy
it
resembled
tempora
mutantur
the
curtains
have
been
dyed
but
there
unbroken
is
the
same
the
very
same
cracked
pane
of
glass
on
which
i
her
name
yes
her
tiny
flourish
still
it
used
to
so
enchant
her
to
link
two
happy
names
in
tempora
mutantur
what
brought
this
here
and
why
was
pamela
away
it
may
be
she
had
found
her
grave
or
he
had
found
her
gay
the
fairest
fade
the
best
of
men
may
meet
with
a
supplanter
how
natural
how
trite
the
cry
tempora
mutantur
piccadilly
when
i
have
felt
a
weariness
or
distaste
at
home
have
i
rushed
out
into
her
crowded
strand
and
fed
my
humour
till
tears
have
wetted
my
cheek
for
unutterable
sympathies
with
the
multitudinous
moving
picture
nursed
amid
her
noise
her
crowds
her
beloved
smoke
what
have
i
been
doing
all
my
life
if
i
have
not
lent
out
my
heart
with
usury
to
such
scenes
lamb
gay
shops
stately
palaces
bustle
and
breeze
the
whirring
of
wheels
and
the
murmur
of
trees
by
night
or
by
day
whether
noisy
or
stilly
whatever
my
mood
love
piccadilly
wet
nights
when
the
gas
on
the
pavement
is
streaming
and
young
love
is
watching
and
old
love
is
dreaming
and
beauty
is
off
to
conquest
where
shrilly
cremona
makes
nimble
thy
toes
piccadilly
bright
days
when
i
leisurely
pace
to
and
fro
and
meet
all
the
people
i
do
or
know
here
is
jolly
old
brown
and
his
fair
daughter
lillie
no
wonder
some
pilgrims
affect
piccadilly
see
yonder
pair
fonder
rode
at
a
canter
she
smiles
on
her
poet
contented
to
saunter
some
envy
her
spouse
and
some
covet
her
filly
he
envies
them
an
ass
piccadilly
now
were
i
that
gay
bride
with
a
slave
at
my
feet
i
would
choose
me
a
house
in
my
favourite
street
yes
or
would
carry
my
point
willy
nilly
if
pick
a
quarrel
if
piccadilly
thus
the
high
frolic
the
lowly
are
seen
as
perched
on
the
roof
of
yon
bulky
machine
the
kensington
tom
smith
or
billy
smoke
doubtful
cigars
in
piccadilly
and
the
balcony
where
ages
ago
old
q
sat
and
gazed
on
the
damsels
below
there
are
plausible
wolves
even
now
seeking
silly
red
riding
hoods
small
in
thy
woods
piccadilly
and
there
is
a
statesman
the
man
of
the
day
a
laughing
philosopher
gallant
and
gay
no
darling
of
fortune
more
manfully
trod
full
of
years
full
of
fame
and
the
world
at
his
nod
can
the
thought
reach
his
heart
and
then
leave
it
more
chilly
p
or
old
q
i
must
quit
piccadilly
life
is
a
patchwork
of
smiles
and
of
frowns
we
valued
its
ups
let
us
muse
on
its
downs
a
side
that
is
bright
it
will
then
turn
the
other
one
turn
if
a
good
one
deserves
such
another
downs
are
delightful
ups
are
not
hilly
let
us
turn
one
more
turn
ere
we
quit
piccadilly
the
old
clerk
we
knew
an
old
clerk
it
was
on
time
an
era
to
set
sober
datists
despairing
then
let
them
despair
sat
in
a
chair
near
a
cross
that
takes
name
from
the
village
of
charing
though
silent
and
lean
darby
was
not
morose
what
hair
he
had
left
was
more
silver
than
sable
his
feet
had
begun
to
turn
up
at
the
toes
from
constantly
being
curled
under
a
table
his
pay
and
expenditure
quite
in
accord
were
both
on
the
strictest
economy
founded
his
rulers
in
conclave
were
known
as
the
board
his
rulers
were
sticks
of
mahogany
rounded
in
his
heart
he
looked
down
on
this
dignified
knot
for
why
the
forefather
of
one
of
these
senators
a
rascal
in
the
gunpowder
plot
had
been
to
progenitors
poor
fool
to
resent
the
caprices
of
luck
still
a
long
thirty
years
it
was
rather
degrading
been
writing
despatches
means
he
had
stuck
some
heads
and
some
tails
to
much
rhodomontading
this
sounds
rather
weary
and
dreary
but
no
though
strictly
inglorious
his
days
were
quiescent
and
his
was
tied
in
a
bow
each
night
when
returning
to
rosemary
crescent
there
joan
meets
him
smiling
the
young
ones
are
there
his
coming
is
bliss
to
the
wee
things
of
his
advent
the
dog
and
the
cat
are
aware
and
phyllis
neat
handed
is
laying
the
this
greeting
the
silent
old
clerk
understands
now
his
friends
he
can
love
had
he
foes
he
could
mock
them
so
met
so
surrounded
his
bosom
expands
some
tongues
have
more
need
of
such
scenes
to
unlock
them
and
darby
at
least
is
to
his
lot
and
joan
rather
proud
of
the
sphere
adorning
has
forgotten
that
gunpowder
plot
and
recall
it
till
ten
the
next
morning
a
time
must
arrive
when
in
pitiful
case
he
will
drop
from
his
branch
like
a
fruit
more
than
mellow
is
he
still
to
be
found
in
his
usual
place
or
is
he
already
forgotten
poor
fellow
if
still
at
his
duty
he
soon
will
arrive
he
passes
this
turning
because
it
is
shorter
if
not
within
sight
as
the
striking
five
we
shall
see
him
before
it
is
chiming
the
quarter
the
garter
the
affirm
that
early
birds
secure
the
worm
and
doubtless
so
they
do
who
scorns
his
couch
should
earn
by
rights
a
world
of
pleasant
sounds
and
sights
that
vanish
with
the
dew
bright
phosphor
from
his
watch
released
now
fading
from
the
purple
the
morning
waxing
stronger
the
comely
cock
that
vainly
strives
to
crow
from
sleep
his
drowsy
wives
who
would
be
dosing
longer
uxorious
chanticleer
and
hark
upraise
thine
eyes
and
find
the
lark
that
matutine
musician
who
heavenward
soars
on
wings
though
sought
unseen
who
mounts
and
sings
in
musical
derision
a
daughter
to
prepare
her
humble
morning
the
sturdy
meal
in
russet
gown
and
apron
blue
the
daughter
sings
like
too
she
plies
her
anon
the
early
reaper
hies
to
waving
fields
that
clasp
the
skies
broad
sheets
of
sunlit
water
all
these
were
heard
or
seen
by
one
who
stole
a
march
upon
that
sun
and
that
daughter
this
dainty
maid
the
pride
a
lambkin
trotting
at
her
side
then
hied
her
through
the
park
a
fond
and
gentle
may
be
she
slumbered
with
her
lamb
thus
rising
with
the
lark
the
lambkin
the
damsel
fain
would
wile
him
back
called
in
vain
the
truant
farther
one
for
the
sake
a
pilgrim
in
an
a
happy
pilgrim
rather
the
maid
gave
chase
the
lambkin
ran
as
only
woolly
vagrant
can
who
never
felt
a
crook
but
at
length
as
disposed
to
drink
where
tawny
sands
disclosed
the
margent
of
a
brook
his
mistress
who
had
fast
cried
rogue
caught
at
last
fleeter
sir
than
then
straight
the
wanderer
where
tangled
shrubs
in
branching
shade
protected
her
from
of
all
save
one
she
glanced
around
all
fearful
lest
the
slightest
sound
might
mortal
footfall
be
then
shrinkingly
she
stepped
aside
one
moment
and
her
garter
tied
the
truant
to
a
tree
perhaps
the
world
may
wish
to
know
the
hue
of
this
delightful
bow
and
how
it
might
be
placed
no
not
from
him
he
only
it
might
be
purple
blue
or
rose
maiden
taste
suffice
it
that
the
nymph
was
fair
with
eyes
and
golden
hair
and
feet
of
lily
dye
and
though
these
feet
were
pure
from
stain
she
turned
her
to
the
brook
again
and
laved
them
dreamingly
awhile
she
sat
in
maiden
mood
and
the
shadows
in
the
flood
which
varied
with
the
stream
and
as
each
pretty
foot
she
dips
the
ripples
ope
their
crystal
lips
in
welcome
as
seem
but
reveries
are
fleeting
things
which
come
and
go
on
wings
now
longer
and
now
shorter
the
fair
one
well
her
nurst
but
when
the
bubble
burst
she
wearied
of
the
water
betook
her
to
the
spot
where
yet
safe
lay
her
snowy
pet
to
roving
tastes
a
martyr
but
something
met
the
gaze
which
made
her
cry
in
sheer
amaze
gracious
my
garter
yes
where
indeed
the
echoes
there
inquisitive
responded
and
the
missing
fetter
a
something
else
a
little
space
must
render
duty
in
its
place
till
for
a
better
the
blushing
fair
her
lamb
led
home
perhaps
resolved
no
more
to
roam
at
peep
of
day
together
if
chance
so
takes
them
it
is
plain
she
will
not
venture
forth
again
without
an
extra
tether
a
fair
white
stone
will
mark
this
he
wears
a
prize
one
lightly
worn
gage
though
not
intended
of
course
guard
it
near
his
heart
till
suns
and
even
stars
depart
and
chivalry
has
ended
and
knighthood
not
envy
you
the
crosses
stars
and
cordons
bleus
which
pride
for
folly
barters
bear
cross
mundane
jars
his
ribbon
prize
and
thank
his
stars
he
does
not
crave
your
garters
the
pilgrims
of
pall
mall
my
little
friend
so
small
and
neat
whom
years
ago
i
used
to
meet
in
pall
mall
daily
how
cheerily
you
away
to
work
it
might
have
been
to
play
you
so
gaily

means
you
then
were
midway
in
the
teens
that
i
was
crowning
we
never
spoke
but
when
i
at
morn
or
eve
i
know
dear
child
you
were
not
frowning
each
morning
when
we
met
i
think
some
sentiment
did
us
two
nor
joy
nor
sorrow
and
then
at
eve
our
hearts
fell
back
upon
the
thought
meet
and
you
were
poor
and
how
and
why
how
kind
to
come
it
was
for
my
especial
grace
meant
had
you
a
parlour
next
the
stars
a
bird
some
plants
in
jars
about
your
casement
you
must
have
dwelt
like
little
darling
eugène
glory
perchance
unwittingly
heard
your
from
that
fifth
storey
seen
some
changes
since
we
met
a
patient
little
seamstress
yet
with
small
means
striving
have
you
a
lilliputian
spouse
and
do
you
dwell
in
some
house
baby
thriving
can
bloom
like
heart
grows
have
sought
that
bourne
unwelcome
still
to
bosom
smarting
the
most
worms
we
are
would
wish
to
finish
this
cigar
before
departing
i
sometimes
to
pall
mall
repair
and
see
the
damsels
passing
there
but
though
i
try
to
obtain
one
glance
they
look
discreet
as
though
someone
else
to
meet
as
have
not
too
yet
still
i
often
muse
upon
our
many
and
gone
now
let
us
make
a
tryste
and
when
dear
little
soul
we
meet
again
in
some
serener
sphere
why
thy
friend
remember
the
russet
pitcher
pitcher
may
go
often
to
the
well
but
it
gets
broken
at
away
ye
simple
ones
away
bring
no
vain
fancies
hither
the
brightest
dreams
of
youth
decay
the
fairest
roses
wither
aye
since
this
fountain
first
was
and
dryad
learnt
to
drink
have
lovers
held
knit
hand
in
hand
sweet
parley
at
its
brink
from
youth
to
age
this
waterfall
most
tunefully
flows
on
but
where
aye
tell
me
where
are
all
those
constant
lovers
gone
the
falcon
on
the
turtle
preys
and
fondest
vows
are
lither
the
brightest
dream
of
youth
decays
the
fairest
roses
wither
russet
pitcher
set
adown
fair
maid
and
list
to
one
who
much
this
sorry
world
hath
known
a
muser
thereupon
though
youth
is
ardent
gay
and
bold
youth
flatters
and
beguiles
though
giles
is
young
i
am
old
trust
thy
heart
to
giles
thy
pitcher
may
some
luckless
day
be
broken
coming
hither
thy
doting
slave
may
prove
a
knave
the
fairest

she
outright
she
him
quite
she
her
russet
pitcher
for
that
dear
sight
an
anchorite
might
deem
himself
the

thy
ways
thy

the
brightest
dream
of
youth
decays
the
fairest
roses
wither
these
days
are
soon
the
days
of
yore
six
summers
pass
and
then
that
musing
man
would
see
once
more
the
fountain
in
the
glen
again
to
stray
where
once
he
those
woods
with
verdure
richer
half
hoping
to
espy
the
maid
come
tripping
with
her
pitcher
no
light
step
comes
but
he
finds
a
mournful
token
there
lies
a
russet
pitcher
the
pitcher
broken
profoundly
moved
that
muser
cried
the
spoiler
hath
been
hither
o
would
the
maiden
first
had
died
the
fairest
rose
must
wither
the
tender
blooms
apace
but
chilling
winds
blow
it
fades
unheeded
and
its
place
shall
never
know
it
more
he
from
that
accursèd
ground
his
bosom
throbbing
a
thence
a
child
he
found
the
little
man
was
sobbing
he
gently
stroked
that
curly
head
child
what
brings
thee
hither
weep
not
my
simple
child
he
said
let
us
weep
together
thy
world
i
ween
my
child
is
green
as
garden
thy
thoughts
should
run
on
mirth
and
fun
where
dost
thou
dwell
my
child
then
the
tiny
urchin
spoke
giles
the
ditcher
i
water
fetch
and
oh
broke
my
russet
pitcher
the
enchanted
rose
where
dost
thou
trip
it
the
patriarch
said
rose
in
thy
bosom
so
daintily
laid
a
pilgrim
whose
shadow
extends
to
the
tomb
would
gaze
on
its
beauty
would
breathe
its
perfume
raise
not
thy
hand
cried
the
maid
suppose
i
ever
can
part
with
this
beautiful
rose
the
bloom
is
a
gift
of
the
fays
who
declare
it
will
shield
me
from
sorrow
as
long
as
i
wear
it
and
sigh
not
old
man
such
a
doleful
dost
think
i
possess
not
the
will
to
say
and
shake
not
thy
head
i
could
pitiless
be
should
supplicants
come
even
younger
than
the
damsel
on
with
a
confident
smile
the
old
man
extended
his
walk
for
a
while
his
musings
were
trite
and
their
burthen
forsooth
the
wisdom
of
age
and
the
folly
of
youth
noon
comes
and
noon
goes
paler
twilight
is
there
rosy
day
dons
the
garb
of
a
penitent
fair
the
patriarch
strolls
in
the
path
of
the
maid
where
cornfields
are
ripe
and
awaiting
the
blade
and
echo
was
mute
to
the
tread

that
patriarch
said
he
onward
advances
where
boughs
overshade
a
lonelier
spot
and
the
barley
is
laid
he
gazes
around
not
a
creature
is
there
no
sound
upon
earth
and
no
voice
in
the
air
but
fading
there
lies
a
poor
bloom
that
he
knows
neglected
beautiful

who
broke
some
hearts
they
say
then
by
saxon
sweetheart
it
was
who
threw
the
peel
away
then
how
little
thought
the
london
fair
or
girl
of
seville
that
should
reel
upon
that
peel
and
find
my
proper
level
a
wish
to
the
south
of
the
church

beneath
yonder
yew
a
pair
of
seen
more
than
once
were
they
there
and
the
years
of
the
two
when
added
might
number
thirteen
they
sat
on
the
grave

had
never
a

the

of
the
dead

determine
it
was
life
paying
death
a
brief
a

text
for
a
sermon
they
tenderly
prattled
was
it
they
said

on
that
hillock

o
ye
poor
little
ones
aught
of
the
dead
or
could
he
be
heedful
of
you
i
wish
to
believe
and
believe
it
i
must
that
a
father
beneath
them
was
laid
i
wish
to
believe
will
take
it
on
trust
that
father
knew
all
that
they
said
my
own
you
are
five
very
nearly
the
age
of
that
poor
little
fatherless
child
and
some
day
a
your
heart
will
engage
when
on
earth
i
my
last
may
have
then
visit
my
grave
like
a
good
little
lass
it
may
happen
to
be
and
if
any
daisies
should
peer
through
the
grass
be
sure
they
are
kisses
from
me
and
place
not
a
stone
to
distinguish
my
name
for
strangers
and
gossips
to
see
but
come
with
your
lover
as
these
lovers
came
and
talk
to
him
gaily
of
me
and
while
you
are
smiling
your
father
will
smile
such
a
sweet
little
daughter
to
have
but
mind
o
yes
mind
you
are
merry
the
wish
you
to
visit
my
my
life
is
at
worthing
an
exile
from
geraldine
how
aimless
how
wretched
an
exile
is
he
promenades

not
even

lovers
foot
them
together

from

this

allurements
alike

you

what
changes
greet
my
wistful
eyes
in

how
is
each
pleasant
nook
the
dumpy
church
used
not

look
so
dumpy

the
spire
this
village
is
no

mine
and
though
the

has
its

may
not
be

the

dwindled

their
ancient

those
sticks

these

grew

these

were

still
i
much
suspect
not
the

i
recollect
but
patty
daughter
and
has
she
too
the
spells
of
breezy
hills
and
silent
dells
where
childhood
loved
to
ramble
then
life
was
thornless
to
our
ken
and
thy
hills
were
then
a
rise
without
a
bramble
whence
comes
the
change
easy
told
how
some
grow
wise
and
some
grow
cold
and
all
feel
time
and
trouble
and
mouldy
sages
much
aver
that
if
the
a
gossamer
the
future
is
a
bubble
so
let
it
be
at
any
rate
my
fate
is
not
the
cruel
fate
which
sometimes
i
have
thought

heart
leaps
up

i
rejoice
as
falls
upon
my
ear

my
frisky
little

on

your
most
unworthy

how

how
strange
to

with
the
dead
joys
dead
loves
and
wishes
thwarted
cruel
proof
of
friendships
fled
and
sad
enough
of
friends
departed
and
the

that
i
wrote
in

john

never
paid
me
back
a

my

our

about
the

on
looking
back
i
acted
like
a
donkey
upon
that
occasion

here
a
letter
from
row
how
mad
i
was
when
first
i
learnt
it
they
would
not
take
my
book
and
now
give
a
trifle
to
have
burnt
it

sprightly

gone
before
to
that
unknown
and
silent
shore
shall
we
not
meet
as
heretofore
some
summer
morning
when
from
thy
cheerful
eyes
a
ray
hath
struck
a
bliss
upon
the
day
a
bliss
that
would
not

still
that

the

of
ancient

when

was

make
old
handiwork
again
he
dearly
those
elders
twain
for
sake
her
gleeful
tones
and
laughter
gay
lent
sunshine
to
a
gloomy
day
and
trouble
fled
yet
when
her
mirth
was
passing
wild
though
still
the
faithful
robin
he
shook
his
head
perchance
the
old
man
fears
that
happiness
is
wed
with
tears
on
this
poor
earth
or
else
may
be
his
fancies
were
that
youth
and
beauty
are
a
snare

are
that
scene
for

old
mien
and
feeble
tread
his
toil
has
ceased
to
be
his
pride
at

he
turns
aside
and
shakes
his
head
and
summer
smiles
but
summer
spells
can
never
charm
where
sorrow
dwells
nor
banish
care
no
fair
young

passer
sees

still
the

trees
throw
shadows
there
the
seat
is
gone
and
where
it

is
set

stone
a
simple
square

austere
may
pass
the
name
recorded
here
but
we
will
stay
to
shed
a
tear
and
breathe
a
prayer
my
firstborn
thou
that
didst
appear
so
fair
to
fond
imagination
dost
rival
in
the
light
of
day
her
delicate
creation

it
shall
not

his

shall
be

of
his
father
my
benjamin
to
yes
much
as
i
wish
for
a
corner
in
each
of
my
wills
i
will
not
be

creaking
of
boots
must
be

it
is
clear
though
his
means
may
be
narrow
this
infant
his
age
will
adorn
i
shall
send
him
to
oxford
from
i
wonder
how
soon
be
born
a
spouse
thus
was
airing
his
fancies
a
labour
of
and
calmly
reflecting
on
more
practical
labour
above
yet
while
it
so
him
to
ponder
elated
at
ease
and
alone
that
pale
patient
victim
up
yonder
had
budding
delights
of
her
