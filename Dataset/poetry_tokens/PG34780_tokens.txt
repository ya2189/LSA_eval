splores
of
a
halloween
twenty
years
ago
by
alexander
dick
woodstock
william
warwick
publisher
preface
the
following
verses
were
sent
to
compete
for
the
prize
offered
in
october
last
by
the
montreal
caledonian
society
for
the
best
poem
on
halloween
they
were
not
successful
and
some
may
be
ready
to
ask
why
then
publish
them
it
may
be
sufficient
to
reply
i
choose
to
do
so
i
choose
to
appeal
from
the
award
of
the
judges
to
the
decision
of
the
public
a
single
sentence
will
explain
why
i
make
such
an
appeal
the
gentlemen
appointed
to
act
as
judges
based
their
decision
according
to
their
published
statement
as
much
upon
suitability
for
recitation
at
a
public
festival
as
upon
literary
merit
had
this
been
stated
in
the
advertisement
inviting
competition
it
would
have
been
all
right
but
it
is
very
evident
that
all
poems
which
might
be
judged
unsuitable
for
such
recitation
would
necessarily
be
excluded
from
competition
whatever
might
be
their
literary
merits
and
the
successful
production
could
only
be
that
which
among
the
suitable
was
regarded
as
possessing
the
greatest
literary
excellence
it
is
on
this
ground
and
not
because
i
could
be
so
vain
as
to
think
that
my
production
to
have
received
the
prize
while
i
was
altogether
unacquainted
with
not
a
few
others
which
may
have
been
rejected
on
the
same
principle
that
i
complain
of
the
award
of
the
judges
and
that
i
now
appeal
from
that
award
by
this
publication
a
poem
may
be
very
well
suited
for
recitation
at
a
public
festival
and
possess
very
slight
claims
to
any
literary
merit
while
another
indefinitely
superior
might
not
in
such
circumstances
be
suitable
for
recitation
at
all
with
the
public
i
now
leave
the
decision
and
shall
cheerfully
acquiesce
in
its
award
whether
favourable
or
the
reverse
woodstock
halloween
this
night
we
meet
o
a
the
nights
for
fun
the
very
wale
when
melancholy
taks
its
flight
and
graning
pains
grow
hale
when
young
anes
wi
sic
antic
tricks
and
wi
their
laughin
music
gar
auld
anes
tae
forget
their
cares
and
the
best
o
physic
and
though
wi
some
we
used
to
meet
we
canna
haud
this
night
yet
we
are
here
to

when
they
took
to
their
heel
but
black
wi
rage
she
shook
her
neive
and
wished
them
wi
the
deil
but
whether

and
raxing
up
upon

looked
down

lively
skirl
and
johnnie
hum
and
thro
a
pue
o
steam
and
reek
he
saw
amid
a
glow
the
pan
and
i
a
fork
did
pat
as
to
the
tune
my
joe
and
bending
owre

han
and
drappin
down
a
blaze
got
up
he
coupit
owre
the
pan
quick
as
a
squirrel
he
dreipit
down
and
owre
the
yard
he
ran
as
quick
cam
johnnie
to
the
front
a
sair
bewildered
man
and
standin
out
fornent
the
door
he
stared
up
at
the
lum
but
fient
a
thing
there
could
he
see
like
either
head
or
bum
then
north
he
ran
then
south
again
the
lum
to
look
about
but
naething
did
he
see
or
hear
it
must
hae
been
auld
cloot
anither
might
hae
blamed
some
ghaist
but
johnnie
faith
was
matter
he
never
dreamed
o
starin
banes
his
thoughts
were
something
fatter
he
now
looked
up
then
down
the
street
if
he
the
cause
could
fin
jock
keeking
round
the
corner
now
said
to
his
neighbours
rin
and
aff
they
ran
and
in
an
ace
they
a
were
out
o
sight
now
johnnie
seeing
naething
that
could
throw
on
ony
light
bethinkin
o
his
pluck
gaed
in
the
sight
was
nane
to
please
for
some
amang

birkies
naething
rued
nae
sooner
were
they
aff
wi
him
than
a
new
splore
was
brewed
though
muckle
tickled
at
the
thought
o
johnnie
clappit
wame
which
might
hae
been
as
stent
a
drum
and
witness
o
its
fame
yet
mair
by
far
they
liked
sic
fun
as
garred

ane
nae
daighie
but
guid
mettle
and
he
had
what
did
recommend
a
wee
spice
o
the
nettle
that
mettle
they
resolved
that
night
to
put

sairest
test
nor
wad
the
faut
be
theirs
if
not
the
nettle
stung
its
best
