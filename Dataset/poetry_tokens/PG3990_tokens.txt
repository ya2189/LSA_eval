this
time
hector
malot
resolved
not
to
write
fiction
any
more
he
announced
this
determination
in
a
card
published
in
the
journal
temps
may
it
was
then
maliciously
stated
that
malot
his
retired
from
business
after
having
accumulated
a
however
he
took
up
his
pen
again
and
published

which
showed
that
in
the
language
of

writ

was
not
dimmed
nor
his
natural
force
abated
and
afforded
him
a
triumph

his
slanderers

the
reunion
when
crozat
the
bohemian
escaped
from
poverty
by
a
good
marriage
that
made
him
a
citizen
of
the
rue
de
vaugirard
he
did
not
break
with
his
old
comrades
instead
of
shunning
them
or
keeping
them
at
a
distance
he
took
pleasure
in
gathering
them
about
him
glad
to
open
his
house
to
them
the
comforts
of
which
were
very
different
from
the
attic
of
the
rue
ganneron
that
he
had
occupied
for
so
long
a
time
every
wednesday
from
four
to
seven
he
had
a
reunion
at
his
house
the
hotel
des
medicis
and
it
was
a
holiday
for
which
his
friends
prepared
themselves
when
a
new
idea
occurred
to
one
of
the
habitues
it
was
caressed
matured
studied
in
solitude
in
order
to
be
presented
in
full
bloom
at
the
assembly
reception
of
his
friends
was
pleasing
simple
like
the
man
cordial
on
the
part
of
the
husband
as
well
as
on
the
part
of
the
wife
who
having
been
an
actress
held
to
the
religion
of
comradeship
on
a
table
were
small
pitchers
of
beer
and
glasses
within
reach
was
an
old
stone
jar
from
beauvais
full
of
tobacco
the
beer
was
good
the
tobacco
dry
and
the
glasses
were
never
empty
and
it
was
not
silly
subjects
that
were
discussed
here
worldly
babblings
or
gossiping
about
absent
friends
but
the
great
questions
that
ruled
humanity
philosophy
politics
society
and
religion
formed
at
first
of
friends
or
at
least
of
comrades
who
had
worked
and
suffered
together
these
reunions
had
enlarged
gradually
until
one
day
the
rooms
at
the
hotel
des
medicis
became
a
where
preachers
of
ideas
and
of
new
religions
thinkers
reformers
apostles
politicians
aesthetes
and
even
babblers
in
search
of
ears
more
or
less
complaisant
that
would
listen
to
them
met
together
any
one
might
come
who
wished
and
if
one
did
not
enter
there
exactly
as
one
would
enter
an
ordinary
hotel
it
was
sufficient
to
be
brought
by
an
habitue
in
order
to
have
the
right
to
a
pipe
some
beer
and
to
speak
one
of
the
habitues
brigard
was
a
species
of
apostle
who
had
acquired
celebrity
by
practising
in
his
daily
life
the
ideas
that
he
professed
and
preached
comte
de
brigard
by
birth
he
began
by
renouncing
his
title
which
made
him
a
vassal
of
the
respect
of
men
and
of
social
conventions
an
instructor
of
law
he
could
easily
have
made
a
thousand
or
twelve
hundred
francs
a
month
but
he
arranged
the
number
and
the
price
of
his
lessons
so
that
each
day
brought
him
only
ten
francs
in
order
that
he
might
not
be
a
slave
to
money
living
with
a
woman
whom
he
loved
he
had
always
insisted
although
he
had
two
daughters
on
living
with
her
union
and
in
not
acknowledging
his
children
legally
because
the
law
debased
the
ties
which
attached
him
to
them
and
lessened
his
duties
it
was
conscience
that
sanctioned
these
duties
and
nature
like
conscience
made
him
the
most
faithful
of
lovers
the
best
the
most
affectionate
the
most
tender
of
fathers
tall
proud
carrying
in
his
person
and
manners
the
native
elegance
of
his
race
he
dressed
like
the
porter
at
the
corner
only
replacing
the
blue
velvet
by
chestnut
velvet
a
less
frivolous
color
living
in
clamart
for
twenty
years
he
always
came
to
paris
on
foot
and
the
only
concessions
that
he
made
to
conventionality
or
to
his
comfort
were
to
wear
sabots
in
winter
and
to
carry
his
vest
on
his
arm
in
summer
thus
organized
he
must
have
disciples
and
he
sought
them
everywhere
in
the
streets
where
he
buttonholed
those
he
was
able
to
snatch
under
the
trees
of
the
luxembourg
gardens
and
on
wednesday
at
the
house
of
his
old
comrade
crozat
how
many
he
had
had
but
unfortunately
the
greater
number
turned
out
badly
several
became
ministers
others
accepted
high
government
positions
for
life
some
handled
millions
of
francs
two
were
at
noumea
one
preached
in
the
pulpit
of
notre
dame
one
afternoon
in
october
the
little
parlor
was
full
the
end
of
the
summer
vacation
had
brought
back
the
habitues
and
for
the
first
time
the
number
was
nearly
large
enough
to
open
a
profitable
discussion
crozat
near
the
door
smiled
at
the
arrivals
on
shaking
hands
and
brigard
his
soft
felt
hat
on
his
head
presided
assisted
by
his
two
favorite
disciples
of
the
moment
the
advocate
nougarede
and
the
poet
glady
neither
of
whom
would
turn
out
badly
he
was
certain
to
tell
the
truth
for
those
who
knew
how
to
look
and
to
see
the
pale
face
of
nougarede
his
thin
lips
restless
eyes
and
an
austerity
of
dress
and
manners
which
clashed
with
his
years
gave
him
more
the
appearance
of
a
man
of
ambition
than
of
an
apostle
and
when
one
knew
that
glady
was
the
owner
of
a
beautiful
house
in
paris
and
of
real
estate
in
the
country
that
brought
him
a
hundred
thousand
francs
a
year
it
was
difficult
to
imagine
that
he
would
long
follow
father
brigard
but
to
see
was
not
the
dominant
faculty
of
brigard
it
was
to
reason
and
reason
told
him
that
ambition
would
soon
make
nougarede
a
deputy
as
fortune
would
one
day
make
glady
an
academician
and
in
that
case
although
he
detested
assemblies
as
much
as
academies
they
would
then
have
two
tribunes
whence
the
good
word
would
fall
on
the
multitude
with
more
weight
they
might
be
counted
on
when
nougarede
began
to
come
to
the
wednesday
reunions
he
was
as
empty
as
a
drum
and
if
he
spoke
brilliantly
on
no
matter
what
subject
with
an
imperturbable
eloquence
it
was
to
say
nothing
in
first
volume
were
words
learnedly
arranged
to
please
the
ears
and
the
eyes
now
ideas
sustained
the
discourse
of
the
advocate
as
the
verses
of
the
poet
said
something
and
these
ideas
were
this
something
was
the
perfume
of
his
teaching
for
half
an
hour
the
pipes
burned
fiercely
the
smoke
slowly
rose
to
the
ceiling
and
as
in
a
cloud
brigard
might
be
seen
like
a
bearded
god
proclaiming
his
law
his
hat
on
his
head
for
if
he
had
made
a
rule
never
to
take
it
off
he
manipulated
it
continually
while
he
spoke
frequently
pushing
it
forward
sometimes
to
the
back
of
his
head
to
the
right
to
the
left
raising
it
and
flattening
it
according
to
the
needs
of
his
argument
is
incontestable
he
said
we
scatter
our
great
force
when
we
ought
to
concentrate
he
pressed
down
his
hat
effect
he
raised
it
hour
has
arrived
for
us
to
assert
ourselves
as
a
group
and
it
is
a
duty
for
us
since
it
is
a
need
of
humanity
at
this
moment
a
new
arrival
glided
into
the
room
quietly
with
the
manifest
intention
of
disturbing
no
one
but
crozat
who
was
seated
near
the
door
stopped
him
and
shook
hands
saniel
my
dear
to
the
table
the
beer
is
good
you
i
am
very
well
without
taking
the
chair
that
crozat
designated
he
leaned
against
the
wall
he
was
a
tall
solid
man
about
thirty
with
tawny
hair
falling
on
the
collar
of
his
coat
a
long
curled
beard
a
face
energetic
but
troubled
and
wan
to
which
the
pale
blue
eyes
gave
an
expression
of
hardness
that
was
accentuated
by
a
prominent
jaw
and
a
decided
air
a
gaul
a
true
gaul
of
ancient
times
strong
bold
and
resolute
brigard
continued
is
this
was
his
formula
because
everything
he
said
was
incontestable
to
him
simply
because
he
said
it
is
incontestable
that
in
the
struggle
for
existence
the
dogma
of
conscience
must
be
established
its
only
sanction
being
the
performance
of
duty
and
inward
satisfaction
accomplished
toward
whom
interrupted
saniel
begin
by
stating
what
are
our
duties
and
codify
what
is
good
and
what
is
is
easy
some
one
replied
if
you
admit
a
certain
innate
regard
for
human
life
for
property
and
for
the
family
but
you
must
acknowledge
that
not
all
men
have
this
regard
how
many
believe
that
it
is
not
a
fault
to
run
away
with
the
wife
of
a
friend
not
a
crime
to
appropriate
something
that
they
want
or
to
kill
an
enemy
where
are
the
duties
of
those
who
reason
and
feel
in
this
way
what
is
their
inward
satisfaction
worth
this
is
why
i
will
not
admit
that
conscience
is
the
proper
guide
of
our
there
were
several
exclamations
at
this
which
brigard
checked
guide
then
shall
men
obey
he
demanded
which
is
the
last
word
of
the
philosophy
of
life
which
leads
to
a
wise
and
progressive
extermination
is
this
what
you
desire
not
i
do
not
shrink
from
an
extermination
that
relieves
humanity
of
idlers
that
it
drags
about
without
power
to
advance
or
to
free
itself
finally
sinking
under
the
load
is
it
not
better
for
the
world
to
be
rid
of
such
people
who
obstruct
the
advancement
of
others
least
the
idea
is
bizarre
coming
from
a
doctor
interrupted
crozat
it
would
put
an
end
to
at
all
i
would
preserve
them
for
the
study
of
placing
society
on
this
antagonistic
footing
said
brigard
destroy
society
itself
which
is
founded
on
reciprocity
on
good
fellowship
and
in
doing
so
you
can
create
for
the
strong
a
state
of
suspicion
that
paralyzes
them
carthage
and
venice
practised
the
selection
by
force
and
destroyed
speak
of
force
my
dear
saniel
interrupted
a
voice
do
you
get
that
the
force
of
things
the
tatum
there
is
no
beginning
no
will
events
decide
for
us
climate
temperament
replied
saniel
is
no
responsibility
and
this
instrument
conscience
that
should
decide
everything
is
good
for
nothing
you
need
not
consider
consequences
success
or
defeat
may
yet
be
immaterial
for
the
accomplishment
of
an
act
that
you
have
believed
condemnable
may
serve
the
race
while
another
that
you
have
believed
beneficent
may
prove
injurious
from
which
it
follows
that
intentions
only
should
be
judged
and
that
no
one
but
god
can
sound
human
hearts
to
their
he
began
to
laugh
you
believe
that
is
that
the
conclusion
at
which
you
have
arrived
a
waiter
entered
carrying
pitchers
of
beer
on
a
tray
and
the
discussion
was
necessarily
interrupted
every
one
drawing
up
to
the
table
where
crozat
filled
the
glasses
and
the
conversation
took
a
more
private
turn
saniel
shook
hands
with
brigard
who
received
him
somewhat
coldly
then
he
approached
glady
with
the
manifest
intention
of
detaining
him
but
glady
had
said
that
he
was
obliged
to
leave
so
saniel
said
that
he
could
remain
no
longer
and
had
only
dropped
in
on
passing
when
they
were
both
gone
brigard
turned
to
crozat
and
nougarede
who
were
near
him
and
declared
that
saniel
made
him
uneasy
believes
himself
stronger
than
life
he
said
he
is
sound
and
intelligent
he
must
take
care
that
he
does
not
go
too
far
chapter
ii
the
rich
refusal
when
saniel
and
glady
reached
the
street
the
rain
that
had
fallen
since
morning
had
ceased
and
the
asphalt
shone
clear
and
glittering
like
a
mirror
walking
is
good
saniel
remarked
will
rain
again
responded
glady
looking
at
the
sky
think
it
was
evident
that
glady
wished
to
take
a
cab
but
as
none
passed
he
was
obliged
to
walk
with
saniel
you
know
he
said
you
have
wounded
brigard
regret
it
sincerely
but
the
salon
of
our
friend
crozat
is
not
yet
a
church
and
i
do
not
suppose
that
discussion
is
forbidden
deny
is
not
to
say
that
as
if
you
were
angry
with
at
all
i
am
sorry
that
you
have
wounded
brigard
nothing
is
too
much
because
i
have
a
sincere
esteem
a
real
friendship
for
you
if
you
will
permit
me
to
say
but
glady
apparently
did
not
desire
the
conversation
to
take
this
turn
think
this
is
an
empty
cab
he
said
as
a
fiacre
approached
them
replied
saniel
see
the
light
of
a
cigar
through
the
glady
made
a
slight
gesture
of
impatience
that
was
not
lost
upon
saniel
who
was
expecting
some
such
demonstration
rich
and
frequenting
the
society
of
poor
men
glady
lived
in
dread
of
borrowers
it
was
enough
for
any
man
to
appear
to
wish
to
talk
to
him
privately
to
make
him
believe
that
he
was
going
to
ask
for
fifty
louis
or
twenty
francs
so
often
was
this
the
case
that
every
friend
or
comrade
was
an
enemy
against
whom
he
must
defend
his
purse
and
so
he
lay
in
wait
as
if
expecting
some
one
to
spring
upon
him
his
eyes
open
his
ears
listening
and
his
hands
in
his
pockets
this
explains
his
attitude
toward
saniel
in
whom
he
scented
a
demand
for
money
and
was
the
reason
for
his
attempt
to
escape
by
taking
a
cab
but
luck
was
against
him
and
he
tried
to
decline
the
unspoken
request
in
another
way
not
be
surprised
he
said
with
the
volubility
with
which
a
man
speaks
when
he
does
not
wish
to
give
his
companion
a
chance
to
say
a
word
i
was
pained
to
see
brigard
take
seriously
an
argument
that
evidently
was
not
directed
against
against
him
nor
against
his
know
that
you
do
not
need
to
defend
yourself
but
i
have
so
much
friendship
so
much
esteem
and
respect
for
brigard
that
everything
that
touches
him
affects
me
and
how
could
it
be
otherwise
when
one
knows
his
value
and
what
a
man
he
is
this
life
of
mediocrity
that
he
lives
in
order
to
be
free
is
it
not
admirable
what
a
beautiful
example
every
one
can
follow
think
that
one
can
not
be
contented
with
ten
francs
a
day
mean
that
not
every
one
has
the
chance
to
make
ten
francs
a
the
vague
fears
of
glady
became
definite
at
these
words
they
had
walked
down
the
rue
ferou
and
reached
the
place
sulpice
think
that
at
last
i
am
going
to
find
a
cab
he
said
precipitately
but
this
hope
was
not
realized
there
was
not
a
single
cab
at
the
station
and
he
was
forced
to
submit
to
the
assault
from
saniel
and
saniel
began
are
compelled
to
walk
with
me
and
frankly
i
rejoice
because
i
wish
to
talk
to
you
of
a
serious
affair
on
which
depends
my
is
a
poor
place
for
serious
do
not
find
it
would
better
appoint
some
other
should
we
since
chance
has
thrown
us
together
here
glady
resigned
himself
to
the
inevitable
and
was
as
polite
as
he
could
be
in
the
circumstances
await
your
pleasure
he
said
in
a
gracious
tone
that
was
a
contrast
to
his
former
one
saniel
who
was
in
such
a
hurry
a
few
moments
before
now
silently
walked
by
glady
whose
eyes
were
on
the
shining
asphalt
pavement
at
last
he
spoke
have
told
you
that
my
future
depends
on
the
affair
concerning
which
i
wish
to
speak
to
you
i
can
tell
you
all
in
a
few
words
if
i
am
not
able
to
procure
three
thousand
francs
within
two
days
i
shall
be
obliged
to
leave
paris
to
give
up
my
studies
and
my
work
here
and
go
and
bury
myself
in
my
native
town
and
become
a
plain
country
glady
did
not
flinch
if
he
had
not
foreseen
the
amount
he
expected
the
demand
and
he
continued
gazing
at
his
feet
know
continued
saniel
i
am
the
son
of
peasants
my
father
was
marshal
in
a
poor
village
of
auvergne
at
school
i
gave
proof
of
a
certain
aptitude
for
work
above
my
comrades
and
our
cure
conceived
an
affection
for
me
and
taught
me
all
he
knew
then
he
made
me
enter
a
small
seminary
but
i
had
neither
the
docile
mind
nor
the
submissive
character
that
was
necessary
for
this
education
and
after
several
years
of
pranks
and
punishments
although
i
was
not
expelled
i
was
given
to
understand
that
my
departure
would
be
hailed
with
delight
i
then
became
usher
in
a
small
school
but
without
salary
taking
board
and
lodging
as
payment
i
passed
a
good
examination
and
was
preparing
for
my
degree
when
i
left
the
school
owing
to
a
quarrel
i
had
made
some
money
by
giving
private
lessons
and
i
found
myself
the
possessor
of
nearly
eighty
francs
i
started
for
paris
where
i
arrived
at
five
one
morning
in
june
and
where
i
knew
no
one
i
had
a
small
trunk
containing
a
few
shirts
which
obliged
me
to
take
a
carriage
i
told
the
coachman
to
take
me
to
a
hotel
in
the
latin
quarter
hotel
he
asked
do
not
care
i
answered
you
wish
to
go
to
the
hotel
du
senat
the
name
pleased
me
perhaps
it
was
an
omen
he
took
me
to
the
hotel
du
senat
where
with
what
i
had
left
of
my
eighty
francs
i
paid
a
month
in
advance
i
stayed
there
eight
is
else
could
i
do
i
knew
latin
and
greek
as
well
as
any
man
in
france
but
as
far
as
anything
else
was
concerned
i
was
as
ignorant
as
a
schoolmaster
the
same
day
i
tried
to
make
use
of
what
i
knew
and
i
went
to
a
publisher
of
classic
books
of
whom
i
had
heard
my
professor
of
greek
literature
speak
after
questioning
me
he
gave
me
a
copy
of
pindar
to
prepare
with
latin
notes
and
advanced
me
thirty
francs
which
lasted
me
a
month
i
came
to
paris
with
the
desire
to
work
but
without
having
made
up
my
mind
what
to
do
i
went
wherever
there
were
lectures
to
the
sorbonne
to
the
college
de
france
to
the
law
school
and
to
the
school
of
medicine
but
it
was
a
month
before
i
came
to
a
decision
the
subtleties
of
law
displeased
me
but
the
study
of
medicine
depending
upon
the
observation
of
facts
attracted
me
and
i
decided
to
become
a
marriage
of
a
marriage
for
love
because
if
i
had
consulted
reason
it
would
have
told
me
that
to
marry
medicine
when
one
has
nothing
neither
family
to
sustain
you
nor
relatives
to
push
you
would
be
to
condemn
yourself
to
a
life
of
trials
of
battles
and
of
misery
my
student
life
was
happy
i
worked
hard
and
by
giving
lessons
in
latin
i
had
enough
to
eat
when
i
received
as
six
eight
nine
hundred
francs
i
thought
it
a
large
fortune
and
i
would
have
remained
in
this
position
for
the
rest
of
my
life
if
i
had
been
able
to
do
so
but
when
i
took
my
degree
of
doctor
i
was
obliged
to
leave
the
hospital
the
possessor
of
several
thousand
francs
i
should
have
followed
rigorously
my
dream
of
ambition
while
attending
the
mistress
of
one
of
my
comrades
i
made
the
acquaintance
of
an
upholsterer
who
suggested
that
he
should
furnish
an
apartment
for
me
and
that
i
might
pay
him
later
i
yielded
to
temptation
remember
i
had
passed
eight
years
in
the
hotel
du
senat
and
i
knew
nothing
of
paris
life
a
home
of
my
own
my
own
furniture
and
a
servant
in
my
anteroom
i
should
be
somebody
my
upholsterer
could
have
installed
me
in
his
own
quarter
of
paris
and
perhaps
could
have
obtained
some
patients
for
me
among
his
customers
who
are
rich
and
fashionable
but
he
did
not
do
this
probably
concluding
that
with
my
awkward
appearance
i
would
not
be
a
success
with
such
people
when
you
are
successful
it
is
original
to
be
a
peasant
people
find
you
clever
but
before
success
comes
to
you
it
is
a
disgrace
he
furnished
me
an
apartment
in
a
very
respectable
house
in
the
rue
when
i
went
into
it
i
had
debts
to
the
amount
of
ten
thousand
francs
behind
me
the
interest
on
this
sum
the
rent
of
two
thousand
four
hundred
francs
not
a
sou
in
my
pocket
not
a
relative
was
did
not
know
that
in
paris
everything
is
accomplished
through
influence
and
i
imagined
that
an
intelligent
man
could
make
his
way
without
assistance
i
was
to
learn
by
experience
when
a
new
doctor
arrives
anywhere
his
brother
doctors
do
not
receive
him
with
much
sympathy
does
this
intruder
want
there
not
enough
of
us
already
he
is
watched
and
the
first
patient
that
he
loses
is
made
use
of
as
an
example
of
his
ignorance
or
imprudence
and
his
position
becomes
uncomfortable
the
chemists
of
my
quarter
whom
i
called
upon
did
not
receive
me
very
warmly
they
made
me
feel
the
distance
that
separates
an
honorable
merchant
from
a
beggar
and
i
was
given
to
understand
that
they
could
patronize
me
only
on
condition
that
i
ordered
the
specialties
that
they
wished
to
profit
by
iron
from
this
one
and
tar
from
that
on
commencing
to
practise
i
had
as
patients
only
the
people
of
the
quarter
whose
principle
was
never
to
pay
a
doctor
and
who
wait
for
the
arrival
of
a
new
one
in
order
that
they
may
be
rid
of
the
old
one
and
this
sort
is
numerous
everywhere
it
happened
that
my
concierge
was
from
auvergne
like
myself
and
he
considered
it
his
duty
to
make
me
give
free
attendance
to
all
those
from
our
country
that
he
could
find
in
the
quarter
and
everywhere
else
so
that
i
had
the
patriotic
satisfaction
of
seeing
all
the
from
auvergne
sprawling
in
my
beautiful
armchairs
finally
by
remaining
religiously
at
home
every
sunday
in
summer
while
the
other
doctors
were
away
by
rising
quickly
at
night
every
time
my
bell
rang
i
was
able
to
acquire
a
practice
among
a
class
of
people
who
were
more
reasonable
and
satisfactory
i
obtained
a
prize
at
the
academy
at
the
same
time
i
delivered
at
a
moderate
price
lectures
in
anatomy
at
schools
on
the
outskirts
of
the
city
i
gave
lessons
i
undertook
all
the
anonymous
work
of
the
book
trade
and
of
journalism
that
i
could
find
i
slept
five
hours
a
day
and
in
four
years
i
had
decreased
my
debt
seven
thousand
francs
if
my
upholsterer
wished
to
be
paid
i
could
have
it
arranged
but
that
was
not
his
intention
he
wishes
to
take
his
furniture
that
is
not
worn
out
and
to
keep
the
money
that
he
has
received
if
i
do
not
pay
these
three
thousand
francs
in
a
few
days
i
shall
be
turned
into
the
street
to
tell
the
truth
i
shall
soon
have
a
thousand
francs
but
those
who
owe
it
to
me
are
not
in
paris
or
will
pay
in
january
behold
my
situation
i
am
desperate
because
there
is
no
one
to
whom
i
can
apply
those
whom
i
have
asked
for
money
have
not
listened
to
me
i
have
told
you
that
i
have
no
relatives
and
neither
have
i
any
friends
perhaps
because
i
am
not
amiable
and
then
i
thought
of
you
you
know
me
you
know
that
people
say
i
have
a
future
before
me
at
the
end
of
three
months
i
shall
be
a
doctor
in
the
hospitals
my
competitors
admit
that
i
shall
not
miss
admission
i
have
undertaken
some
experiments
that
will
perhaps
give
me
fame
will
you
give
me
your
hand
glady
extended
it
toward
him
thank
you
for
having
applied
to
me
it
is
a
proof
of
confidence
that
touches
he
pressed
the
hand
that
he
had
taken
with
some
warmth
see
that
you
have
divined
the
sentiments
of
esteem
with
which
you
have
inspired
saniel
drew
a
long
breath
continued
glady
can
not
do
what
you
desire
without
deviating
from
my
usual
line
of
conduct
when
i
started
out
in
life
i
lent
to
all
those
who
appealed
to
me
and
when
i
did
not
lose
my
friends
i
lost
my
money
i
then
took
an
oath
to
refuse
every
one
it
is
an
oath
that
i
can
not
break
what
would
my
old
friends
say
if
they
learned
that
i
did
for
a
young
man
what
i
have
refused
to
do
for
them
would
know
it
they
had
reached
the
quai
voltaire
where
fiacres
were
stationed
last
here
are
some
cabs
glady
said
me
for
leaving
you
but
i
am
in
a
chapter
iii
a
last
resort
gady
entered
the
cab
so
quickly
that
saniel
remained
staring
at
the
sidewalk
slightly
dazed
it
was
only
when
the
door
closed
that
he
understood
conscience
he
murmured
them
tartufes
after
a
moment
of
hesitation
he
continued
his
way
and
reached
the
bridge
of
but
he
walked
with
doubtful
steps
like
a
man
who
does
not
know
where
he
is
going
presently
he
stopped
and
leaning
his
arms
on
the
parapet
watched
the
sombre
rapidly
flowing
seine
its
small
waves
fringed
with
white
foam
the
rain
had
ceased
but
the
wind
blew
in
squalls
roughening
the
surface
of
the
river
and
making
the
red
and
green
lights
of
the
omnibus
boats
sway
in
the
darkness
the
came
and
went
and
more
than
one
examined
him
from
the
corner
of
the
eye
wondering
what
this
tall
man
was
doing
there
and
if
he
intended
to
throw
himself
into
the
water
and
why
not
what
better
could
he
do
and
this
was
what
saniel
said
to
himself
while
watching
the
flowing
water
one
plunge
and
he
would
end
the
fierce
battle
in
which
he
had
so
madly
engaged
for
four
years
and
which
would
in
the
end
drive
him
mad
it
was
not
the
first
time
that
this
idea
of
ending
everything
had
tempted
him
and
he
only
warded
it
off
by
constantly
inventing
combinations
which
it
seemed
to
him
at
the
moment
might
save
him
why
yield
to
such
a
temptation
before
trying
everything
and
this
was
how
he
happened
to
appeal
to
glady
but
he
knew
him
and
knew
that
his
avarice
about
which
every
one
joked
had
a
certain
reason
for
its
existence
however
he
said
to
himself
that
if
the
landed
proprietor
obstinately
refused
a
friendly
loan
which
would
only
pay
the
debts
of
youth
the
poet
would
willingly
fill
the
role
of
providence
and
save
from
shipwreck
without
risking
anything
a
man
with
a
future
who
later
would
pay
him
back
it
was
with
this
hope
that
he
risked
a
refusal
the
landed
proprietor
replied
the
poet
was
silent
and
now
there
was
nothing
to
expect
from
any
one
glady
was
his
last
resort
in
explaining
his
situation
to
glady
he
lightened
the
misery
instead
of
exaggerating
it
for
it
was
not
only
his
upholsterer
that
he
owed
but
also
his
tailor
his
bootmaker
his
his
concierge
and
all
those
with
whom
he
had
dealings
in
reality
his
creditors
had
not
harassed
him
very
much
until
lately
but
this
state
of
affairs
would
not
last
when
they
saw
him
prosecuted
they
also
would
sue
him
and
how
could
he
defend
himself
how
should
he
live
his
only
resource
would
be
to
return
to
the
hotel
du
senat
where
even
they
would
not
leave
him
in
peace
or
to
his
native
town
and
become
a
country
doctor
in
either
case
it
was
renouncing
all
his
ambitions
would
it
not
be
better
to
die
what
good
was
life
if
his
dreams
were
not
realized
if
he
had
nothing
that
he
wanted
like
many
who
frequently
come
in
contact
with
death
life
in
itself
was
a
small
thing
to
him
his
own
life
as
well
as
that
of
others
with
hamlet
he
said
die
to
sleep
no
more
but
without
adding
die
to
sleep
perchance
to
dream
feeling
certain
that
the
dead
do
not
dream
and
what
is
better
than
sleep
to
those
who
have
had
a
hard
life
he
was
absorbed
in
thought
when
something
came
between
him
and
the
flaring
gaslight
and
threw
a
shadow
over
him
that
made
him
straighten
himself
up
what
was
it
only
a
policeman
who
came
and
leaned
against
the
parapet
near
him
he
understood
his
attitude
was
that
of
a
man
who
contemplates
throwing
himself
into
the
river
and
the
policeman
had
placed
himself
there
in
order
to
prevent
it
he
said
to
the
astonished
man
he
continued
his
way
walking
quickly
but
hearing
distinctly
the
steps
of
the
policeman
following
him
who
evidently
took
him
for
a
madman
who
must
be
watched
when
he
left
the
bridge
of
for
the
place
du
carrousel
this
surveillance
ceased
and
he
could
then
indulge
freely
in
reflection
at
least
as
freely
as
his
trouble
and
discouragement
permitted
weak
kill
themselves
the
strong
fight
to
their
last
and
low
as
he
was
he
was
not
yet
at
his
last
breath
when
he
decided
to
appeal
to
glady
he
had
hesitated
between
him
and
a
usurer
named
caffie
whom
he
did
not
know
personally
but
whom
he
had
heard
spoken
of
as
a
rascal
who
was
interested
in
all
sorts
of
affairs
preferring
the
bad
to
the
good
of
successions
marriages
interdictions
extortions
and
if
he
had
not
been
to
him
it
was
for
fear
of
being
refused
as
much
as
from
the
dread
of
putting
himself
in
such
hands
in
case
of
meeting
with
compliance
but
these
scruples
and
these
fears
were
useless
now
since
glady
failed
him
cost
what
it
might
and
happen
what
would
he
must
go
to
this
scamp
for
assistance
he
knew
that
caffie
lived
in
the
rue
but
he
did
not
know
the
number
he
had
only
to
go
to
one
of
his
patients
a
in
the
rue
therese
to
find
his
address
in
the
directory
it
was
but
a
step
and
he
decided
to
run
the
risk
there
was
need
of
haste
discouraged
by
all
the
applications
that
he
had
made
up
to
this
time
disheartened
by
betrayed
hopes
irritated
by
rebuffs
he
did
not
deceive
himself
as
to
the
chances
of
this
last
attempt
but
at
least
he
would
try
it
slight
though
the
hope
of
success
might
be
it
was
an
old
house
where
caffie
lived
and
had
been
formerly
a
private
hotel
it
was
composed
of
two
wings
one
on
the
street
the
other
on
an
inside
court
a
porte
cochere
gave
access
to
this
court
and
under
its
roof
near
the
staircase
was
the
lodge
saniel
knocked
at
the
door
in
vain
it
was
locked
and
would
not
open
he
waited
several
minutes
and
in
his
nervous
impatience
walked
restlessly
up
and
down
the
court
at
last
an
old
woman
appeared
carrying
a
small
wax
taper
she
was
feeble
and
bent
and
began
to
excuse
herself
she
was
alone
and
could
not
be
everywhere
at
the
same
time
in
her
lodge
and
lighting
the
lamps
on
the
stairways
caffie
lived
on
the
first
floor
in
the
wing
on
the
street
saniel
mounted
the
stairs
and
rang
the
bell
a
long
time
passed
or
at
least
it
seemed
long
to
him
before
there
was
an
answer
at
last
he
heard
a
slow
and
heavy
step
on
the
tiled
floor
and
the
door
was
opened
but
held
by
a
hand
and
a
foot

a
fact
and
caffie
concluding
to
open
the
door
asked
saniel
to
enter
and
then
closed
it
into
my
they
were
in
a
small
room
filled
with
papers
that
had
only
an
old
desk
and
three
chairs
for
furniture
it
communicated
with
the
office
of
the
business
man
which
was
larger
but
furnished
with
the
same
simplicity
and
strewn
with
scraps
of
paper
that
had
a
mouldy
smell
clerk
is
ill
just
now
caffie
said
when
i
am
alone
i
do
not
like
to
open
the
after
giving
this
excuse
he
offered
saniel
a
chair
and
seating
himself
before
his
desk
lighted
by
a
lamp
from
which
he
had
taken
the
shade
he
said
i
am
ready
to
listen
to
he
replaced
the
shade
on
the
lamp
saniel
made
his
request
concisely
without
the
details
that
he
had
entered
into
with
glady
he
owed
three
thousand
francs
to
the
upholsterer
who
had
furnished
his
apartment
and
as
he
could
not
pay
immediately
he
was
in
danger
of
being
prosecuted
is
the
upholsterer
caffie
asked
while
holding
his
left
jaw
with
his
right
hand
boulevard
know
him
it
is
his
trade
to
take
back
his
furniture
in
this
way
after
three
quarters
of
the
sum
has
been
paid
and
he
has
become
rich
at
it
how
much
money
have
you
already
paid
of
this
ten
thousand
francs
the
interest
and
what
i
have
paid
in
instalments
nearly
twelve
thousand
you
still
owe
three
thousand
is
caffie
seemed
full
of
admiration
for
this
manner
of
proceeding
guarantee
have
you
to
offer
for
this
loan
of
three
thousand
francs
other
than
my
present
position
i
confess
and
above
all
my
at
request
he
explained
his
plans
and
prospects
for
the
future
while
the
business
man
with
his
cheek
resting
on
his
hand
listened
and
from
time
to
time
breathed
a
stifled
sigh
a
sort
of
groan
hum
he
said
when
saniel
finished
his
explanation
know
my
dear
friend
you
know
to
fools
alone
the
smile
unchangeable
appears
for
laughter
sun
may
change
to

is
sunday
with
you
my
dear
i
am
not
at
the
end
of
my
life
nor
at
the
end
of
my
energy
and
i
assure
you
that
my
energy
makes
me
capable
of
many
do
not
doubt
it
i
know
what
energy
can
do
tell
a
greek
who
is
dying
of
hunger
to
go
to
heaven
and
he
will
go
graeculus
esuriens
in
coelum
jusseris
i
do
not
see
that
you
have
started
for
a
smile
of
derision
accompanied
by
a
grimace
crossed
caffies
face
before
becoming
the
usurer
of
the
rue
whom
every
one
called
a
rascal
he
had
been
attorney
in
the
country
deputy
judge
and
if
unmerited
evils
had
obliged
him
to
resign
and
to
hide
the
unpleasant
circumstances
in
paris
he
never
lost
an
opportunity
to
prove
that
by
education
he
was
far
above
his
present
position
finding
this
new
client
a
man
of
learning
he
was
glad
to
make
quotations
that
he
thought
would
make
him
worthy
of
consideration
is
perhaps
because
i
am
not
greek
saniel
replied
i
am
an
auvergnat
and
the
men
of
my
country
have
great
physical
caffie
shook
his
head
dear
sir
he
said
might
as
well
tell
you
frankly
that
i
do
not
believe
the
thing
can
be
done
i
would
do
it
myself
willingly
because
i
read
intelligence
in
your
face
and
resolution
in
your
whole
person
which
inspire
me
with
confidence
in
you
but
i
have
no
money
to
put
into
such
speculations
i
can
only
be
as
usual
a
that
is
to
say
i
can
propose
the
loan
to
one
of
my
clients
but
i
do
not
know
one
who
would
be
contented
with
the
guarantee
of
a
future
that
is
more
or
less
uncertain
there
are
so
many
doctors
in
paris
who
are
in
your
saniel
rose
you
going
cried
caffie
down
my
dear
sir
it
is
no
use
to
throw
the
handle
after
the
axe
you
make
me
a
proposition
and
i
show
you
the
difficulties
in
the
way
but
i
do
not
say
there
is
no
way
to
extricate
you
from
embarrassment
i
must
look
around
i
have
known
you
only
a
few
minutes
but
it
does
not
take
long
to
appreciate
a
man
like
you
and
frankly
you
inspire
me
with
great
what
did
he
wish
saniel
was
not
simple
enough
to
be
caught
by
words
nor
was
he
a
fop
who
accepts
with
gaping
mouth
all
the
compliments
addressed
to
him
why
did
he
inspire
a
sudden
interest
in
this
man
who
had
the
reputation
of
pushing
business
matters
to
extremes
he
would
find
out
in
the
mean
time
he
would
be
on
his
guard
thank
you
for
your
sympathy
he
said
shall
prove
to
you
that
it
is
real
and
that
it
may
become
useful
you
come
to
me
because
you
want
three
thousand
francs
i
hope
i
may
find
them
for
you
and
i
promise
to
try
though
it
will
be
difficult
very
difficult
they
will
make
you
secure
for
the
present
but
will
they
assure
your
future
that
is
will
they
permit
you
to
continue
the
important
works
of
which
you
have
spoken
to
me
and
on
which
your
future
depends
no
your
struggles
will
soon
begin
again
and
you
must
shake
yourself
clear
from
such
cares
in
order
to
secure
for
yourself
the
liberty
that
is
indispensable
if
you
wish
to
advance
rapidly
and
to
obtain
this
freedom
from
cares
and
this
liberty

only
one
way

saniel
who
was
on
his
guard
and
expected
some
sort
of
roguery
from
this
man
had
not
foreseen
that
these
expressions
of
interest
were
leading
up
to
a
proposal
of
marriage
and
an
exclamation
of
surprise
escaped
him
but
it
was
lost
in
the
sound
of
the
which
rang
at
that
moment
caffie
rose
disagreeable
it
is
not
to
have
a
clerk
he
said
he
went
to
open
the
door
with
an
eagerness
that
he
had
not
shown
to
saniel
which
proved
that
he
had
no
fear
of
admitting
people
when
he
was
not
alone
it
was
a
clerk
from
the
bank
will
permit
me
caffie
said
on
returning
to
his
office
will
take
but
an
the
clerk
took
a
paper
from
his
portfolio
and
handed
it
to
caffie
caffie
drew
a
key
from
the
pocket
of
his
vest
with
which
he
opened
the
iron
safe
placed
behind
his
desk
and
turning
his
back
to
saniel
and
the
clerk
counted
the
bills
which
they
heard
rustle
in
his
hands
presently
he
rose
and
closing
the
door
of
the
safe
he
placed
under
the
lamp
the
package
of
bills
that
he
had
counted
the
clerk
then
counted
them
and
placing
them
in
his
portfolio
took
his
leave
the
door
when
you
go
out
caffie
said
who
was
already
seated
in
his
not
be
when
the
clerk
was
gone
caffie
apologized
for
the
interruption
us
continue
our
conversation
my
dear
sir
i
told
you
that
there
is
only
one
way
to
relieve
you
permanently
from
embarrassment
and
that
way
you
will
find
is
in
a
good
marriage
that
will
place
et
a
reasonable
sum
at
your
it
would
be
folly
for
me
to
marry
now
when
i
have
no
position
to
offer
a
your
future
of
which
you
have
just
spoken
with
so
much
assurance
have
you
no
faith
in
that
absolute
faith
as
firm
as
when
i
first
began
the
battle
of
life
only
brighter
however
as
others
have
not
the
same
reasons
that
i
have
to
hope
and
believe
what
i
hope
and
believe
it
is
quite
natural
that
they
should
feel
doubts
of
my
future
you
felt
it
yourself
instantly
in
not
finding
it
a
good
guarantee
for
the
small
loan
of
three
thousand
loan
and
marriage
are
not
the
same
thing
a
loan
relieves
you
temporarily
and
leaves
you
in
a
state
to
contract
several
others
successively
which
you
must
acknowledge
weakens
the
guarantee
that
you
offer
while
a
marriage
instantly
opens
to
you
the
road
that
your
ambition
wishes
to
have
never
thought
of
you
should
think
of
it
must
be
a
woman
first
of
i
should
propose
one
what
would
you
say
are
surprised
confess
that
i
dear
sir
i
am
the
friend
of
my
clients
and
for
many
of
them
i
dare
to
say
it
a
father
and
having
much
affection
for
a
young
woman
and
for
the
daughter
of
one
of
my
friends
while
listening
to
you
i
thought
that
one
or
the
other
might
be
the
woman
you
need
both
have
fortunes
and
both
possess
physical
attractions
that
a
handsome
man
like
yourself
has
a
right
to
demand
and
for
the
rest
i
have
their
photographs
and
you
may
see
for
yourself
what
they
he
opened
a
drawer
in
his
desk
and
took
from
it
a
package
of
photographs
as
he
turned
them
over
saniel
saw
that
they
were
all
portraits
of
women
presently
he
selected
two
and
handed
them
to
saniel
one
represented
a
woman
from
to
forty
years
corpulent
robust
covered
with
horrible
cheap
jewelry
that
she
had
evidently
put
on
for
the
purpose
of
being
photographed
the
other
was
a
young
girl
of
about
twenty
years
pretty
simply
and
elegantly
dressed
whose
distinguished
and
reserved
physiognomy
was
a
strong
contrast
to
the
first
portrait
while
saniel
looked
at
these
pictures
caffie
studied
him
trying
to
discover
the
effect
they
produced
that
you
have
seen
them
he
said
us
talk
of
them
a
little
if
you
knew
me
better
my
dear
sir
you
would
know
that
i
am
frankness
itself
and
in
business
my
principle
is
to
tell
everything
the
good
and
the
bad
so
that
my
clients
are
responsible
for
the
decisions
they
make
in
reality
there
is
nothing
bad
about
these
two
persons
because
if
there
were
i
would
not
propose
them
to
you
but
there
are
certain
things
that
my
delicacy
compels
me
to
point
out
to
you
which
i
do
frankly
feeling
certain
that
a
man
like
you
is
not
the
slave
of
narrow
an
expression
of
pain
passed
over
his
face
and
he
clasped
his
jaw
with
both
hands
suffer
saniel
asked
from
my
teeth
cruelly
pardon
me
that
i
show
it
i
know
by
myself
that
nothing
is
more
annoying
than
the
sight
of
the
sufferings
of
least
not
to
mind
we
will
return
to
my
clients
this
and
he
touched
the
portrait
of
the
bejewelled
woman
as
you
have
divined
already
a
widow
a
very
amiable
widow
perhaps
she
is
a
little
older
than
you
are
but
that
is
nothing
your
experience
must
have
taught
you
that
the
man
who
wishes
to
be
loved
tenderly
loved
pampered
caressed
spoiled
should
marry
a
woman
older
than
himself
who
will
treat
him
as
a
husband
and
as
a
son
her
first
husband
was
a
careful
merchant
who
had
he
lived
would
have
made
a
large
fortune
in
the
butcher
he
mumbled
this
word
instead
of
pronouncing
it
clearly
although
he
died
just
at
the
time
when
his
affairs
were
beginning
to
develop
he
left
twenty
thousand
income
to
his
wife
as
i
have
told
you
what
is
good
i
must
tell
you
what
is
to
be
regretted
carried
away
by
gay
companions
this
intelligent
man
became
addicted
to
intemperance
and
from
drinking
at
saloons
she
soon
took
to
drinking
at
home
and
his
wife
drank
with
him
i
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
she
has
reformed
but
if
it
is
otherwise
you
a
doctor
can
easily
cure
her
believe
it
doubt
however
if
it
is
impossible
you
need
only
let
her
alone
and
her
vice
will
soon
carry
her
off
and
as
the
contract
will
be
made
according
to
my
wishes
in
view
of
such
an
event
you
will
find
yourself
invested
with
a
fortune
and
unencumbered
with
a
the
other
saniel
said
who
had
listened
silently
to
this
curious
explanation
of
the
situation
that
caffie
made
with
the
most
perfect
so
grave
were
the
circumstances
that
he
could
not
help
being
amused
at
this
diplomacy
expected
your
demand
replied
the
agent
with
a
shrewd
smile
if
i
spoke
of
this
amiable
widow
it
was
rather
to
acquit
my
conscience
than
with
any
hope
of
succeeding
however
free
from
prejudices
one
may
be
one
always
retains
a
few
i
understand
yours
and
more
than
that
i
share
them
happily
what
i
am
now
about
to
tell
you
is
something
quite
different
take
her
photograph
my
dear
sir
and
look
at
it
while
i
talk
a
charming
face
is
it
not
she
has
been
finely
educated
at
a
fashionable
convent
in
a
word
a
pearl
that
you
shall
wear
and
now
i
must
tell
you
the
flaw
for
there
is
one
who
is
blameless
the
daughter
of
one
of
our
leading
actresses
after
leaving
the
convent
she
returned
to
live
with
her
mother
it
was
there
in
this
ahem
that
an
accident
happened
to
her
to
be
brief
she
has
a
sweet
little
child
that
the
father
would
have
recognized
assuredly
had
he
not
been
already
married
but
at
least
he
has
provided
for
its
future
by
an
endowment
of
two
hundred
thousand
francs
in
such
a
way
that
whoever
marries
the
mother
and
legitimizes
the
child
will
enjoy
the
interest
of
this
sum
until
the
majority
if
that
ever
arrives
these
little
creatures
are
so
fragile
you
being
a
physician
you
know
more
about
that
than
any
one
in
case
of
an
accident
the
father
will
inherit
half
the
money
from
his
son
and
if
it
seems
cruel
for
an
own
father
to
inherit
from
his
own
son
it
is
quite
a
different
thing
when
it
is
a
stranger
who
receives
the
fortune
this
is
all
my
dear
sir
plainly
and
frankly
and
i
will
not
do
you
the
injury
to
suppose
that
you
do
not
see
the
advantages
of
what
i
have
said
to
you
without
need
of
my
insisting
further
if
i
have
not
explained
clearly
nothing
is
more
it
is
the
fault
of
this
pain
that
paralyzes
and
he
groaned
while
holding
his
jaw
have
a
troublesome
tooth
saniel
said
with
the
tone
of
a
physician
who
questions
a
patient
my
teeth
trouble
me
to
tell
the
truth
they
are
all
going
to
you
consulted
a
doctor
a
doctor
nor
a
dentist
i
have
faith
in
medicine
of
course
but
when
i
consult
doctors
which
seldom
happens
i
notice
that
they
think
much
more
of
their
own
affairs
than
of
what
i
am
saying
and
that
keeps
me
away
from
them
but
my
dear
sir
when
a
client
consults
me
i
put
myself
in
his
while
he
spoke
saniel
examined
him
which
he
had
not
done
until
this
moment
and
he
saw
the
characteristic
signs
of
rapid
consumption
his
clothes
hung
on
him
as
if
made
for
a
man
twice
his
size
and
his
face
was

i

the
advantages
of
the
proposition
that
i
have
made

have
time
to

more
reasonable
there
is
no
i
am
in
a
hurry
because
if
i
do
not
pay
jardine
i
shall
find
myself
in
the
street
which
would
not
be
a
position
to
offer
to
a
the
street
oh
things
will
not
come
to
such
a
pass
as
that
what
are
the
prosecutions
will
soon
begin
jardine
has
already
threatened
are
going
to
begin
then
they
have
not
begun
if
he
does
as
we
presume
he
will
proceed
by
a
replevin
we
shall
have
sufficient
time
before
the
judgment
do
you
owe
anything
to
your
landlord
lease
expired
on
the
not
pay
is
easy
it
is
the
only
thing
that
is
easy
for
me
to
is
an
obstacle
in
the
way
of
your
jardine
and
may
stop
him
a
moment
we
can
manage
this
way
more
easily
the
important
thing
is
to
warn
me
as
soon
as
the
fire
begins
my
dear
chapter
a
charming
visitor
although
saniel
had
had
no
experience
in
business
he
was
not
simple
enough
not
to
know
that
in
refusing
him
this
loan
caffie
meant
to
make
use
of
him
is
very
simple
he
said
to
himself
as
he
went
downstairs
undertakes
to
manage
my
affairs
and
in
such
a
way
that
some
day
i
shall
have
to
save
myself
by
marrying
that
charming
girl
what
a
scoundrel
however
the
situation
was
such
that
he
was
glad
to
avail
himself
of
the
assistance
of
this
scoundrel
at
least
some
time
was
gained
and
when
jardine
found
that
he
was
not
disposed
to
let
himself
be
slaughtered
he
might
accept
a
reasonable
arrangement
but
he
must
manage
so
that
caffie
would
not
prevent
this
arrangement
unfortunately
he
felt
himself
hardly
capable
of
such
manoeuvring
having
been
always
straightforward
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
end
he
wished
to
attain
and
thinking
only
of
the
work
through
which
he
would
attain
it
and
now
he
must
act
the
part
of
a
diplomat
submitting
to
craftiness
and
rogueries
that
were
not
at
all
in
accord
with
his
open
nature
he
had
begun
by
not
telling
caffie
instantly
what
he
thought
of
his
propositions
but
it
is
more
difficult
to
act
than
to
control
self
to
speak
than
to
be
silent
what
would
he
say
what
would
he
do
when
the
time
for
action
came
he
reached
his
house
without
having
decided
anything
and
as
he
passed
before
the
lodge
absorbed
in
thought
he
heard
some
one
call
him
come
in
a
moment
i
beg
of
he
thought
some
one
wished
to
consult
him
some
countryman
who
had
waited
for
his
return
and
although
he
did
not
feel
like
listening
patiently
to
idle
complainings
he
turned
back
and
entered
the
lodge
one
brought
this
the
concierge
said
handing
him
a
paper
that
was
stamped
and
covered
with
a
running
handwriting
was
the
beginning
of
the
fire
of
which
caffie
had
spoken
without
reading
it
saniel
put
it
in
his
pocket
and
turned
to
go
but
the
concierge
detained
him
would
like
to
say
two
words
to
le
about
this
you
read
it
but
i
talked
with
the
officer
who
gave
it
to
me
and
he
told
me
what
it
meant
it
is
unfortunate
to
be
pitied
by
his
concierge
this
was
too
much
is
not
as
he
told
you
he
replied
haughtily
much
the
better
i
am
glad
for
you
and
for
me
you
can
pay
my
little
it
to
have
given
it
to
you
twice
already
but
i
have
a
copy
here
it
to
be
sued
by
a
creditor
paralyzed
saniel
he
was
stunned
crushed
humiliated
and
could
only
answer
stupidly
taking
the
bill
that
the
concierge
handed
him
he
put
it
in
his
pocket
and
stammered
a
few
words
see
doctor
i
must
say
what
has
been
in
my
heart
a
long
time
you
are
my
countryman
and
i
esteem
you
too
much
not
to
speak
in
taking
your
apartment
and
engaging
your
upholsterer
you
did
too
much
you
ruin
yourself
give
up
your
apartment
and
take
the
one
opposite
that
costs
less
than
half
and
you
will
get
on
you
will
not
be
obliged
to
leave
this
quarter
what
will
become
of
our
neighbors
if
you
leave
us
you
are
a
good
doctor
everybody
knows
it
and
says
so
and
now
as
for
my
bill
it
is
understood
that
i
shall
be
paid
first
shall
i
not
soon
as
i
have
the
money
i
will
pay
is
a
promise
promise
you
very
it
could
be
it
would
suit
me
i
am
not
rich
you
know
but
i
have
always
paid
the
for
your
with
the
paper
in
his
pocket
saniel
returned
to
caffie
who
was
just
going
out
and
to
whom
he
gave
it
will
see
about
it
this
evening
said
the
man
of
business
now
i
am
going
to
dinner
do
not
worry
i
will
do
what
is
necessary
i
am
dying
of
but
three
days
before
saniel
emptied
his
purse
to
soothe
his
upholsterer
by
an
instalment
as
large
as
he
was
able
to
make
it
keeping
only
five
francs
for
himself
and
with
the
few
sous
left
he
could
not
go
to
a
restaurant
not
even
the
lowest
and
cheapest
he
could
only
buy
some
bread
for
his
supper
and
eat
it
while
working
as
he
had
often
done
before
but
when
he
returned
to
his
rooms
he
was
not
in
a
state
of
mind
to
write
an
article
that
must
be
delivered
that
evening
among
other
things
that
he
had
undertaken
was
one
and
not
the
least
fastidious
which
consisted
in
giving
by
correspondence
advice
to
the
subscribers
of
a
fashion
magazine
or
more
exactly
speaking
to
recommend
in
the
form
of
medical
advice
all
the
cosmetics
depilatories
elixirs
dyes
essences
oils
creams
soaps
pomades
toothpowders
rouges
and
also
all
the
specialties
to
which
their
inventors
wished
to
give
an
authority
that
the
public
which
believes
itself
acute
refused
to
the
simple
advertisement
on
the
last
page
with
his
ambition
and
the
career
before
him
he
would
never
have
consented
to
carry
on
this
correspondence
under
his
own
name
he
did
it
for
a
neighboring
doctor
a
simple
man
who
was
not
so
cautious
and
who
signed
his
name
to
these
letters
glad
to
get
clients
from
any
quarter
for
his
trouble
saniel
took
this
place
during
sunday
in
summer
and
from
time
to
time
received
a
box
of
perfumery
or
quack
medicines
which
he
sold
at
a
low
price
when
occasion
offered
every
week
he
received
the
list
of
cosmetics
and
specialties
that
he
must
make
use
of
in
his
correspondence
no
matter
how
he
recommended
them
whether
in
answer
to
letters
that
were
really
addressed
to
him
or
by
inventing
questions
that
gave
him
the
opportunity
to
introduce
them
he
began
to
consult
this
list
and
the
pile
of
letters
from
subscribers
that
the
magazine
had
sent
him
when
the
doorbell
rang
perhaps
it
was
a
patient
the
good
patient
whom
he
had
expected
for
four
years
he
left
his
desk
to
open
the
door
it
was
his
coal
man
who
came
with
his
bill
will
stop
some
day
when
i
am
near
you
saniel
said
am
in
a
hurry
this
i
am
in
a
hurry
too
i
must
pay
a
large
bill
tomorrow
and
i
count
upon
having
some
money
from
have
no
money
after
a
long
talk
he
got
rid
of
the
man
and
returned
to
his
desk
he
had
answered
but
a
few
of
the
many
letters
when
his
bell
rang
again
this
time
he
would
not
open
the
door
it
was
a
creditor
without
doubt
and
he
continued
his
correspondence
but
for
four
years
he
had
waited
for
chance
to
draw
him
a
good
ticket
in
the
lottery
of
life
a
rich
patient
afflicted
with
a
cyst
or
a
tumor
that
he
would
take
to
a
fashionable
surgeon
who
would
divide
with
him
the
ten
or
fifteen
thousand
francs
that
he
would
receive
for
the
operation
in
that
case
he
would
be
saved
he
ran
to
the
door
the
patient
with
the
cyst
presented
himself
in
the
form
of
a
small
bearded
man
with
a
red
face
wearing
over
his
vest
the
apron
of
coarse
black
cloth
in
fact
it
was
the
wine
merchant
from
the
corner
who
having
heard
of
the
visit
came
to
ask
for
the
payment
of
his
bill
for
furnishing
wine
for
three
months
a
scene
similar
to
that
which
he
had
had
with
the
coal
merchant
but
more
violent
took
place
and
it
was
only
by
threatening
to
put
him
out
of
the
door
that
saniel
got
rid
of
the
man
who
went
away
declaring
that
he
would
come
the
next
morning
with
an
officer
saniel
returned
to
his
work
his
pen
flew
over
the
paper
when
a
noise
made
him
raise
his
head
either
he
had
not
closed
the
door
tightly
or
his
servant
was
entering
with
his
key
what
did
he
want
he
did
not
employ
him
all
day
but
only
during
his
office
hours
to
put
his
rooms
in
order
and
to
open
the
door
for
his
clients
as
saniel
rose
to
go
and
see
who
it
was
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
it
was
his
servant
with
a
blank
and
embarrassed
air
is
the
matter
joseph
thought
i
should
find
you
sir
so
i
joseph
hesitated
then
taking
courage
he
said
volubly
while
lowering
his
eyes
came
to
ask
sir
if
you
will
pay
me
my
month
which
expired
on
the
fifteenth
because
there
is
need
of
money
at
my
house
if
there
was
not
need
of
money
i
would
not
have
come
if
you
wish
sir
i
will
release
you
will
take
the
coat
that
you
made
me
order
a
month
ago
i
am
quite
sure
it
is
not
worth
what
is
due
me
but
it
is
always
the
joseph
took
the
coat
from
the
wardrobe
in
the
hall
and
rolled
it
in
a
newspaper
course
you
will
not
expect
me
in
the
morning
he
said
as
he
put
his
key
on
the
table
must
look
out
for
another
well
i
shall
not
expect
and
joseph
hurried
away
as
quickly
as
possible
left
alone
saniel
did
not
return
to
his
work
immediately
but
throwing
himself
in
an
armchair
he
cast
a
melancholy
glance
around
his
office
and
through
the
open
door
into
the
parlor
in
the
faint
light
of
the
candle
he
saw
the
large
armchairs
methodically
placed
each
side
of
the
chimney
the
curtains
at
the
windows
lost
in
shadow
and
all
the
furniture
which
for
four
years
had
cost
him
so
many
efforts
he
had
long
been
the
prisoner
of
this
louis
xiv
camlet
and
he
was
now
going
to
be
executed
a
beautiful
affair
truly
brilliant
and
able
all
this
had
been
used
only
by
the
poor
auvergnats
without
saniel
enjoying
it
at
all
for
he
had
neither
the
bourgeois
taste
for
ornaments
nor
the
desire
for
elegance
a
movement
of
anger
and
revolt
against
himself
made
him
strike
his
desk
with
his
fist
what
a
fool
he
had
been
the
bell
rang
again
this
time
not
expecting
a
rich
patient
he
would
not
open
it
after
a
moment
a
slight
tap
was
heard
on
the
panel
he
rose
quickly
and
ran
to
open
the
door
a
woman
threw
herself
into
his
arms
my
dearest
i
am
so
glad
to
find
you
at
home
chapter
vi
a
sweet
consoler
she
passed
her
arm
about
him
and
pressed
him
to
her
and
with
arms
entwined
they
entered
the
study
glad
i
am
she
said
a
good
idea
i
had
with
a
quick
movement
she
took
off
her
long
gray
cloak
that
enveloped
her
from
head
to
foot
are
you
glad
she
asked
as
she
stood
looking
at
him
you
ask
that
to
hear
you
say
that
you
you
not
my
only
joy
the
sweet
lamp
that
gives
me
light
in
the
cavern
where
i
work
day
and
night
victor
she
was
a
tall
slender
young
woman
with
chestnut
hair
whose
thick
curls
clustering
about
her
forehead
almost
touched
her
eyebrows
her
beautiful
eyes
were
dark
her
nose
short
while
her
superb
teeth
and
rich
lips
gave
her
the
effect
of
a
pretty
doll
and
she
had
gayety
playful
vivacity
gracious
effrontery
and
a
passionate
caressing
glance
dressed
extravagantly
like
the
parisian
woman
who
has
not
a
sou
but
who
adorns
everything
she
wears
she
had
an
ease
a
freedom
a
natural
elegance
that
was
charming
with
this
she
had
the
voice
of
a
child
a
joyous
laugh
and
an
expression
of
sensibility
on
her
fresh
face
have
come
to
dine
with
you
she
said
gayly
i
am
so
he
made
a
gesture
that
was
not
lost
upon
her
i
disturb
you
she
asked
uneasily
at
you
go
out
why
did
you
make
a
gesture
that
showed
indifference
or
at
least
embarrassment
are
mistaken
my
little
any
one
else
i
might
be
mistaken
but
with
you
it
is
impossible
you
know
that
between
us
words
are
not
necessary
that
i
read
in
your
eyes
what
you
would
say
in
your
face
what
you
think
and
feel
is
it
not
always
so
when
one
loves
as
i
love
you
he
took
her
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
long
and
tenderly
then
going
to
a
chair
on
which
he
had
thrown
his
coat
he
drew
from
the
pocket
the
bread
that
he
had
bought
is
my
dinner
he
said
showing
the
bread
i
must
scold
you
work
is
making
you
lose
your
head
can
you
not
take
time
to
eat
he
smiled
sadly
is
not
time
that
i
he
fumbled
in
his
pocket
and
brought
out
three
big
sous
can
not
dine
at
a
restaurant
with
six
she
threw
herself
in
his
arms
dearest
forgive
me
she
cried
dear
martyr
dear
great
man
it
is
i
who
accuse
you
when
i
ought
to
embrace
your
knees
and
you
do
not
scold
me
a
sad
smile
is
your
only
reply
and
it
is
really
so
bad
as
that
nothing
to
eat
is
very
good
eating
if
i
might
be
assured
that
i
shall
always
have
some
you
shall
have
something
more
and
better
this
morning
seeing
the
storm
an
idea
came
to
me
associated
with
you
it
is
quite
natural
since
you
are
always
in
my
heart
and
in
my
thoughts
i
told
mamma
that
if
the
storm
continued
i
would
dine
at
the
pension
you
can
imagine
with
what
joy
i
listened
to
the
wind
all
day
and
watched
the
rain
and
leaves
falling
and
the
dead
branches
waving
in
the
whirlwind
thank
god
the
weather
was
bad
enough
for
mamma
to
believe
me
safe
at
the
pension
and
here
i
am
but
we
must
not
fast
i
shall
go
and
buy
something
to
eat
and
we
will
play
at
making
dinner
by
the
fire
which
will
be
far
more
amusing
than
going
to
a
she
put
on
her
cloak
quickly
the
table
while
i
make
my
have
my
article
to
finish
that
will
be
sent
for
at
eight
just
think
i
have
three
tonics
to
recommend
four
preparations
of

soaps

business

then
do
not
trouble
yourself
about
the
table
we
will
set
it
together
when
you
have
finished
and
that
will
be

more
take
everything
in

it
better
to
look

dark
side
i
shall
soon
she
went
to
the
door
not
be
extravagant
he
said
is
no
danger
she
replied
striking
her
pocket
then
returning
to
him
she
embraced
him
passionately
and
she
ran
out
they
had
loved
each
other
for
two
years
at
the
time
they
met
saniel
was
giving
a
course
of
lectures
on
anatomy
at
a
young
school
just
outside
of
paris
and
every
time
he
went
out
there
he
saw
a
young
woman
whom
he
could
not
help
noticing
she
came
and
went
on
the
same
trains
that
he
did
and
gave
lessons
in
a
rival
school
as
she
frequently
carried
under
her
arm
a
large
cartoon
and
sometimes
a
plaster
cast
he
concluded
that
she
gave
lessons
in
drawing
at
first
he
paid
no
attention
to
her
what
was
she
to
him
he
had
more
important
things
in
his
head
than
women
but
little
by
little
and
because
she
was
reserved
and
discreet
he
was
struck
by
the
vivacity
and
gayety
of
her
expression
he
really
enjoyed
looking
at
this
pretty
and
pleasing
young
woman
however
his
looks
said
nothing
if
their
eyes
smiled
when
they
met
that
was
all
they
did
not
make
each
acquaintance
when
they
left
the
train
they
did
not
notice
each
other
if
he
took
the
left
side
of
the
street
she
took
the
other
and
vice
versa
this
state
of
things
lasted
several
months
without
a
word
having
been
exchanged
between
them
in
due
time
they
learned
each
names
and
professions
she
was
a
professor
of
drawing
as
he
supposed
the
daughter
of
an
artist
who
had
been
dead
several
years
and
was
called
mademoiselle
phillis
cormier
he
was
a
physician
for
whom
a
brilliant
future
was
prophesied
a
man
of
power
who
would
some
day
be
famous
and
very
naturally
their
attitude
remained
the
same
there
was
no
particular
reason
why
it
should
change
but
accident
made
a
reason
one
summer
day
at
the
hour
when
they
ordinarily
took
the
train
back
to
paris
the
sky
suddenly
became
overcast
and
it
was
evident
that
a
violent
storm
was
approaching
saniel
saw
phillis
hurrying
to
the
station
without
an
umbrella
and
as
some
friend
had
lent
him
one
he
decided
to
speak
to
her
for
the
first
time
seems
as
if
the
storm
would
overtake
us
before
we
reach
the
station
as
you
have
no
umbrella
will
you
permit
me
to
walk
beside
you
and
to
shelter
you
with
mine
she
replied
with
a
smile
and
they
walked
side
by
side
until
the
rain
began
to
fall
when
she
drew
nearer
to
him
and
they
entered
the
station
talking
gayly
umbrella
is
better
than
skirt
she
said
what
is
skirt
you
not
read
paul
and
virginia
she
looked
at
him
with
a
mocking
smile
wondering
what
superior
men
read
not
only
had
he
not
read
bernardin
de
romance
nor
any
others
but
he
had
never
been
in
love
he
knew
nothing
of
the
affairs
of
the
heart
nor
of
the
imagination
leisure
must
be
had
for
light
reading
and
even
more
for
love
for
they
require
a
liberty
of
mind
and
an
independence
of
life
that
he
had
not
where
could
he
find
time
to
read
novels
when
and
how
could
he
pay
attention
to
a
woman
those
that
he
had
known
since
his
arrival
in
paris
had
not
had
the
slightest
influence
over
him
and
he
retained
only
faint
memories
of
them
on
the
contrary
thinking
of
this
walk
in
the
rain
he
remembered
this
young
girl
with
a
vividness
entirely
new
to
him
she
made
a
strong
impression
on
him
and
it
remained
he
saw
her
again
with
her
smile
that
showed
her
brilliant
teeth
he
heard
the
music
of
her
voice
and
the
bare
plain
that
he
had
walked
so
many
times
now
seemed
the
most
beautiful
country
in
the
world
to
him
evidently
there
was
a
change
in
him
something
was
awakened
in
his
soul
for
the
first
time
he
discovered
that
the
hollow
and
muscular
conoid
organ
called
the
heart
had
a
use
besides
for
the
circulation
of
blood
what
a
surprise
and
what
a
disappointment
was
he
going
to
be
simpleton
enough
to
love
this
young
girl
and
entangle
his
life
already
so
hard
and
heavily
weighted
with
a
woman
a
fine
thing
truly
and
nature
had
built
him
to
play
the
lover
it
is
true
that
only
those
who
wish
it
fall
in
love
and
he
knew
the
power
of
will
by
experience
but
he
soon
lost
confidence
in
himself
away
from
phillis
he
could
do
as
he
wished
but
with
her
it
was
as
she
wished
with
one
look
she
mastered
him
he
met
her
furious
at
the
influence
she
exercised
over
him
and
against
which
he
had
struggled
since
their
last
meeting
he
left
her
ravished
at
feeling
how
profoundly
he
loved
her
to
a
man
whose
life
had
been
ruled
by
reason
and
logic
until
this
moment
these
contradictions
were
exasperating
and
he
only
excused
himself
for
submitting
to
them
by
saying
that
they
could
in
no
way
modify
the
line
of
conduct
that
he
had
traced
out
for
himself
nor
make
him
deviate
from
the
road
that
he
followed
rich
or
even
with
a
small
fortune
he
might
when
he
was
with
her
and
in
her
power
let
himself
be
carried
away
but
when
he
was
dying
of
hunger
he
was
not
going
to
commit
the
folly
of
taking
a
wife
what
would
he
have
to
give
her
misery
nothing
but
misery
and
shame
in
default
of
any
other
reason
would
forever
prevent
him
from
offering
himself
to
her
she
was
the
daughter
of
an
artist
who
after
years
of
struggle
died
at
the
moment
when
fortune
was
beginning
to
smile
upon
him
ten
years
more
of
work
and
he
would
have
left
his
family
if
not
rich
at
least
in
comfortable
circumstances
in
reality
he
left
nothing
but
ruin
the
hotel
he
built
was
sold
and
after
the
debts
were
paid
nothing
remained
but
some
furniture
his
widow
son
and
daughter
must
work
the
widow
having
no
trade
took
in
sewing
the
son
left
college
to
become
the
clerk
of
a
named
caffie
the
daughter
who
happily
for
her
had
learned
to
draw
and
paint
under
her
direction
obtained
pupils
and
designed
menacs
for
the
stationers
and
painted
silk
fans
and
boxes
they
lived
with
great
economy
submitting
to
many
privations
the
brother
weary
of
his
monotonous
existence
and
of
the
exactions
of
his
master
left
them
to
try
his
fortunes
in
america
if
saniel
ever
married
which
he
doubted
certainly
he
would
not
marry
a
woman
situated
as
phillis
was
this
reflection
was
reassuring
and
he
was
more
devoted
to
her
why
should
he
not
enjoy
the
delicious
pleasure
of
seeing
her
and
listening
to
her
his
life
was
neither
gay
nor
happy
he
felt
perfectly
sure
of
himself
and
as
he
knew
her
now
he
was
also
sure
of
her
a
brave
and
honest
girl
otherwise
how
had
she
divined
that
he
loved
her
they
continued
to
see
each
other
with
a
pleasure
that
seemed
equal
on
both
sides
meeting
in
the
station
arranging
to
take
the
same
trains
and
talking
freely
and
gayly
things
went
on
this
way
until
the
approach
of
vacation
when
they
decided
to
take
a
walk
after
their
last
lesson
instead
of
returning
immediately
to
paris
when
the
day
came
the
sun
was
very
hot
they
had
walked
some
distance
when
phillis
expressed
a
wish
to
rest
for
a
few
minutes
they
seated
themselves
in
a
shady
copse
and
soon
found
themselves
in
each
arms
since
then
saniel
had
never
spoken
of
marriage
and
neither
had
phillis
they
loved
each
other
chapter
vii
a
little
dinner
for
two
saniel
was
still
at
work
when
phillis
returned
have
not
yet
finished
dear
me
time
to
cure
by
correspondence
a
malady
that
has
not
yielded
to
the
care
of
ten
physicians
and
i
am
in
three
lines
he
finished
the
letter
and
left
his
desk
am
ready
what
shall
i
do
me
to
take
things
out
of
my
press
too
hard
she
said
as
he
took
each
parcel
at
last
the
pockets
were
empty
shall
we
dine
she
asked
as
the
is
transformed
into
a
let
us
begin
by
making
a
good
fire
i
wet
my
feet
coming
from
the
do
not
know
whether
there
is
any
us
she
took
the
candle
and
they
passed
into
the
kitchen
which
like
the
was
a
laboratory
a
stable
where
saniel
kept
in
cages
pigs
from
india
and
rabbits
for
his
experiments
and
where
joseph
heaped
the
things
that
were
in
his
way
without
paying
any
attention
to
the
stove
in
which
there
never
had
been
a
fire
but
their
search
was
vain
there
was
everything
in
this
kitchen
except
you
value
these
boxes
she
asked
caressing
a
little
pig
that
she
had
taken
in
her
arms
at
all
they
enclosed
the
perfumes
and
tonics
but
they
are
useless
they
returned
to
the
office
saniel
carrying
the
boxes
will
set
the
table
here
she
said
gayly
for
saniel
told
her
that
the
was
uninviting
as
it
was
a
small
bacteriological
laboratory
the
table
was
set
by
phillis
who
went
and
came
walking
about
with
a
gracefulness
that
saniel
admired
are
doing
nothing
she
said
am
watching
you
and
the
result
of
these
thoughts
is
that
you
have
a
fund
of
and
gayety
an
exuberance
of
life
that
would
enliven
a
man
condemned
to
what
would
have
become
of
us
i
should
like
to
know
if
i
had
been
melancholy
and
discouraged
when
we
lost
my
poor
papa
he
was
joy
itself
singing
all
day
long
laughing
and
joking
he
brought
me
up
and
i
am
like
him
mamma
as
you
know
is
melancholy
and
nervous
looking
on
the
dark
side
and
florentin
is
like
her
i
obtained
a
place
for
florentin
i
found
work
for
mamma
and
for
myself
we
all
took
courage
and
gradually
we
became
she
looked
at
him
with
a
smile
that
said
you
let
me
do
for
you
what
i
have
done
for
others
but
she
did
not
speak
these
words
on
the
contrary
she
immediately
endeavored
to
destroy
the
impression
which
she
believed
her
words
had
made
upon
him
and
bring
some
water
she
said
i
will
light
the
when
he
returned
carrying
a
carafe
the
fire
blazed
brightly
lighting
the
whole
room
phillis
was
seated
at
the
desk
writing
are
you
doing
he
asked
in
surprise
am
writing
our
menu
for
you
know
we
are
not
going
to
sit
down
at
the
table
like
the
bourgeois
how
do
you
like
it
she
read
it
to
him
de
de
dinde
de
pate
de
foie
gras
aux
truffes
du
this
is
a
you
think
that
i
would
offer
you
a
fricandeau
au
jus
she
continued
de
a
la
creme
de
voila
what
wine
i
do
not
wish
to
deceive
you
let
us
put
from
the
at
the
and
now
we
will
sit
as
he
was
about
to
seat
himself
she
said
do
not
give
me
your
arm
to
conduct
me
to
the
table
if
we
do
not
do
things
seriously
and
methodically
we
shall
not
believe
in
them
and
perhaps
the
perigord
truffles
will
change
into
little
black
pieces
of
anything
when
they
were
seated
opposite
to
each
other
she
continued
jesting
dear
doctor
did
you
go
to
the
representation
of
don
juan
on
monday
and
saniel
who
in
spite
of
all
had
kept
a
sober
face
now
laughed
loudly
she
cried
clapping
her
hands
more
preoccupation
no
more
cares
look
into
my
eyes
dear
victor
and
think
only
of
the
present
hour
of
the
joy
of
being
together
of
our
she
reached
her
hand
over
the
table
and
he
pressed
it
in
his
the
dinner
continued
gayly
saniel
replying
to
smiles
who
would
not
permit
the
conversation
to
languish
she
helped
him
to
each
dish
poured
out
his
wine
leaving
her
chair
occasionally
to
put
a
piece
of
wood
on
the
fire
and
such
shoutings
and
laughter
had
never
been
heard
before
in
that
office
however
she
noticed
that
little
by
little
face
that
relaxed
one
moment
was
the
next
clouded
by
the
preoccupation
and
bitterness
that
she
had
tried
hard
to
chase
away
she
would
make
a
new
effort
not
this
charming
little
dinner
give
you
the
wish
to
repeat
it
where
i
am
able
to
come
this
evening
without
making
mamma
uneasy
i
shall
find
some
excuse
to
come
again
next
he
shook
his
head
you
engagements
for
the
whole
of
next
week
she
asked
with
uneasiness
shall
i
be
next
week
in
a
few
days
alarm
me
explain
i
beg
of
you
o
victor
have
pity
do
not
leave
me
in
are
right
i
ought
to
tell
you
everything
and
not
let
your
tender
heart
torment
itself
trying
to
explain
my
you
have
cares
do
you
not
esteem
me
enough
to
let
me
share
them
with
you
you
know
that
i
love
you
you
only
forever
saniel
had
not
left
her
ignorant
of
the
difficulties
of
his
position
but
he
had
not
entered
into
details
preferring
to
speak
of
his
hopes
rather
than
of
his
present
misery
the
story
that
he
had
already
told
to
glady
and
caffie
he
now
told
to
phillis
adding
what
had
passed
with
the
concierge
the
the
coal
man
and
joseph
she
listened
stupefied
took
your
coat
she
murmured
was
what
he
came
so
hard
as
you
have
how
did
you
come
to
such
a
pass
you
i
believed
in
the
virtue
of
work
and
look
at
me
because
i
felt
within
me
a
will
that
nothing
could
weaken
a
strength
that
nothing
could
fatigue
a
courage
that
nothing
could
dishearten
i
imagined
that
i
was
armed
for
battle
in
such
a
way
that
i
should
never
be
conquered
and
i
am
conquered
as
much
by
the
fault
of
circumstances
as
by
my
own
in
what
are
you
to
blame
poor
dear
my
ignorance
of
life
stupidity
presumption
and
blindness
if
i
had
been
less
simple
should
i
have
been
taken
in
by
propositions
should
i
have
accepted
this
furniture
this
apartment
he
told
me
that
the
papers
he
made
me
sign
were
mere
formalities
that
in
reality
i
might
pay
when
i
could
and
that
he
would
be
content
with
a
fair
interest
that
seemed
reasonable
and
without
inquiring
further
i
accepted
happy
and
delighted
to
have
a
home
feeling
sure
of
having
strength
to
bear
this
burden
to
have
confidence
in
self
is
strength
but
it
is
also
weakness
because
you
love
me
you
do
not
know
me
you
do
not
see
me
as
i
am
in
reality
i
am
not
sociable
and
i
lack
absolutely
suppleness
delicacy
politeness
as
much
in
my
character
as
in
my
manners
being
so
how
can
i
obtain
a
large
practice
or
succeed
unless
it
is
by
some
stroke
of
luck
i
have
counted
on
the
luck
but
its
hour
has
not
yet
sounded
because
i
lack
suppleness
i
have
not
been
able
to
win
the
sympathy
or
interest
of
my
masters
they
see
only
my
reserve
and
because
i
stay
away
from
them
as
much
through
timidity
as
pride
they
do
not
come
to
me
which
is
quite
natural
i
admit
and
because
i
have
not
yielded
my
ideas
to
the
authority
of
others
they
have
taken
a
dislike
to
me
which
is
still
more
natural
because
i
lack
politeness
and
am
still
an
auvergnat
heavy
and
awkward
as
nature
made
me
men
of
the
world
disdain
me
judging
me
by
my
exterior
which
they
see
and
dislike
more
wary
more
sly
more
experienced
i
should
be
at
least
sustained
by
friendship
but
i
have
given
no
thought
to
it
what
good
is
it
i
had
no
need
of
it
my
force
was
sufficient
i
find
it
more
easy
to
make
myself
feared
than
loved
thus
formed
there
are
only
two
things
for
me
to
do
remain
in
my
poor
room
in
the
hotel
du
senat
living
by
giving
lessons
and
by
work
from
the
booksellers
until
the
examination
and
admission
to
the
central
bureau
or
to
establish
myself
in
an
quarter
at
belleville
montrouge
or
elsewhere
and
there
practise
among
people
who
will
demand
neither
politeness
nor
fine
manners
as
these
two
ways
are
reasonable
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
neither
belleville
because
i
should
work
only
with
my
legs
like
one
of
my
comrades
whom
i
saw
work
at
villette
tongue
good
your
arm
and
while
he
is
supposed
to
be
feeling
the
pulse
of
the
patient
with
one
hand
with
the
other
he
is
writing
his
prescription
purgative
forty
sous
and
he
hurries
away
his
diagnosis
having
taken
less
than
five
minutes
he
had
no
time
to
waste
i
object
to
the
hotel
du
senat
because
i
have
had
enough
of
it
and
it
was
there
that
jardine
tempted
me
with
his
proposals
see
what
he
has
brought
me
to
now
chapter
viii
explanations
at
this
moment
without
warning
the
candle
on
the
table
went
out
phillis
rose
are
the
candles
she
asked
are
no
more
this
was
the
we
must
brighten
up
the
she
threw
a
small
log
on
the
hearth
and
then
instead
of
resuming
her
seat
she
took
a
cushion
from
the
sofa
and
placing
it
before
the
chimney
threw
herself
upon
it
and
leaned
her
elbow
on
knee
now
she
repeated
her
eyes
raised
to
his
i
suppose
the
only
thing
for
me
to
do
is
to
return
to
auvergne
and
become
a
country
god
is
it
possible
she
murmured
in
a
tone
that
surprised
saniel
if
there
was
sadness
in
this
cry
there
was
also
a
sentiment
that
he
did
not
understand
leaving
the
school
i
could
continue
to
live
at
the
hotel
du
senat
and
while
giving
lessons
prepare
my
now
after
having
reached
a
certain
position
can
i
return
to
this
life
of
poverty
and
study
my
creditors
who
have
fallen
on
me
here
will
harass
me
and
my
competitors
will
mock
my
misery
which
is
caused
by
my
vices
they
will
think
that
i
dishonor
the
faculty
and
i
shall
be
rebuffed
neither
doctor
of
the
hospitals
nor
fellow
i
shall
be
reduced
to
nothing
but
a
doctor
of
the
quarter
of
what
use
is
it
the
effort
has
been
made
here
you
see
how
it
has
you
mean
to
go
without
sorrow
and
despair
since
it
will
be
our
separation
the
renouncement
of
all
the
hopes
on
which
i
have
lived
for
ten
years
the
abandonment
of
my
work
death
itself
you
see
now
why
in
spite
of
your
gayety
i
have
not
been
able
to
hide
my
preoccupation
from
you
the
more
charming
you
were
the
more
i
felt
how
dear
you
are
and
the
greater
my
despair
at
the
thought
of
should
we
separate
do
you
mean
she
turned
toward
him
go
with
you
you
must
acknowledge
that
until
this
moment
i
have
never
spoken
to
you
of
marriage
and
never
have
i
let
the
thought
appear
that
you
might
one
day
make
me
your
wife
in
your
position
in
the
struggle
you
have
been
through
a
wife
would
have
been
a
burden
that
would
have
paralyzed
you
above
all
such
a
poor
miserable
creature
as
myself
with
no
dot
but
her
misery
and
that
of
her
family
but
the
conditions
are
no
longer
the
same
you
are
as
miserable
as
i
am
and
more
desperate
in
your
own
country
where
you
have
only
distant
relatives
who
are
nothing
to
you
as
they
have
not
your
education
or
ideas
desires
or
habits
what
will
become
of
you
all
alone
with
your
disappointment
and
regrets
if
you
accept
me
i
will
go
with
you
together
and
loving
each
other
we
can
not
be
unhappy
anywhere
when
you
come
home
fatigued
you
will
find
me
with
a
smile
when
you
stay
at
home
you
will
tell
me
your
thoughts
and
explain
your
work
and
i
will
try
to
understand
i
have
no
fear
of
poverty
you
know
and
neither
do
i
fear
solitude
wherever
we
are
together
i
shall
be
happy
all
that
i
ask
of
you
is
to
take
my
mother
with
us
because
you
know
i
can
not
leave
her
alone
in
attending
her
you
have
learned
to
know
her
well
enough
to
know
that
she
is
not
disagreeable
or
difficult
to
please
as
for
florentin
he
will
remain
in
paris
and
work
his
trip
to
america
has
made
him
wise
and
his
ambition
will
now
be
easily
satisfied
to
earn
a
small
salary
is
all
that
he
asks
without
doubt
we
shall
be
a
burden
but
not
so
heavy
as
one
might
think
at
first
a
woman
when
she
chooses
brings
order
and
economy
into
a
house
and
i
promise
you
that
i
will
be
that
woman
and
then
i
will
work
i
am
sure
my
stationer
will
give
me
as
many
menus
when
i
am
in
auvergne
as
he
does
now
that
i
am
in
paris
i
could
also
without
doubt
procure
other
work
it
would
be
a
hundred
francs
a
month
perhaps
a
hundred
and
fifty
perhaps
even
two
hundred
while
waiting
for
your
patients
to
come
we
could
live
on
this
money
in
auvergne
living
must
be
she
had
taken
his
hands
in
hers
and
she
watched
anxiously
his
face
as
the
firelight
shone
on
it
to
see
the
effect
of
her
words
it
was
the
life
of
both
of
them
that
was
to
be
decided
and
the
fulness
of
her
heart
made
her
voice
tremble
what
would
he
reply
she
saw
that
his
face
was
agitated
without
being
able
to
read
more
as
she
remained
silent
he
took
her
head
in
his
hands
and
looked
in
her
face
for
several
moments
you
love
me
he
said
me
prove
it
in
some
way
besides
in
would
be
cowardly
to
let
you
share
my
would
be
loving
me
enough
to
feel
sure
that
i
would
be
i
not
the
love
in
your
heart
greater
than
pride
do
you
not
feel
that
since
i
have
loved
you
my
love
has
filled
all
my
life
and
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
in
the
present
or
in
the
future
but
it
and
you
because
i
see
you
for
several
hours
from
time
to
time
in
paris
i
am
happy
whatever
difficulties
await
us
i
should
be
much
happier
in
auvergne
because
we
should
be
together
he
remained
silent
for
some
time
you
love
me
there
he
murmured
evidently
it
was
more
to
himself
than
to
her
that
he
addressed
this
question
which
was
the
sum
of
his
reflections
dear
victor
she
cried
do
you
doubt
me
have
i
deserved
it
the
past
the
present
do
they
not
assure
the
future
he
shook
his
head
man
you
have
loved
whom
you
love
has
never
shown
himself
to
you
as
he
really
is
in
spite
of
the
trials
and
sorrows
of
his
life
he
has
been
able
to
answer
your
smile
with
a
smile
because
cruel
as
his
life
was
he
was
sustained
by
hope
and
confidence
in
auvergne
there
will
be
no
more
hope
or
confidence
but
the
madness
of
a
broken
life
and
the
dejection
of
impotence
what
sort
of
man
should
i
be
could
you
love
such
a
man
thousand
times
more
for
he
would
be
unhappy
and
i
should
have
to
comfort
you
have
the
strength
to
do
it
after
a
time
you
would
become
weary
for
the
burden
would
be
too
heavy
however
great
your
devotion
or
profound
your
tenderness
to
see
my
real
position
and
my
hopes
and
descending
into
the
future
to
see
my
ruin
you
know
i
am
ambitious
without
having
ever
compassed
the
scope
of
this
ambition
and
of
the
hopes
dreams
if
you
like
on
which
it
rests
understand
that
these
dreams
are
on
the
eve
of
being
realized
two
months
more
and
in
december
or
january
i
pass
the
for
the
central
bureau
which
will
make
me
a
physician
of
the
hospitals
and
at
the
same
time
the
one
for
the
admission
which
opens
the
faculty
of
medicine
to
me
without
pride
i
believe
myself
in
a
position
to
succeed
what
sportsmen
call
and
just
when
i
have
only
a
few
days
to
wait
behold
me
ruined
forever
man
leaves
his
village
for
paris
to
make
a
name
for
himself
and
he
returns
only
when
bad
luck
or
inability
sends
him
back
and
then
it
is
only
every
four
years
that
there
is
a
for
admission
in
four
years
what
will
be
my
moral
and
intellectual
condition
how
should
i
support
this
exile
of
four
years
imagine
the
effect
that
four
years
of
isolation
in
the
mountains
will
produce
but
this
is
not
all
besides
this
ostensible
end
that
i
have
pursued
since
i
left
my
village
i
have
my
special
work
that
i
can
carry
out
only
in
paris
without
having
overwhelmed
you
with
the
details
of
medicine
you
know
that
it
is
about
to
undergo
a
revolution
that
will
transform
it
until
now
it
has
been
taught
officially
in
pathology
that
the
human
organism
carries
within
itself
the
germ
of
a
great
many
infectious
diseases
which
develop
spontaneously
in
certain
conditions
for
instance
that
tuberculosis
is
the
result
of
fatigue
privations
and
physiological
miseries
well
recently
it
has
been
admitted
that
is
to
say
the
revolutionists
admit
a
parasitical
origin
for
these
diseases
and
in
france
and
germany
there
is
an
army
looking
for
these
parasites
i
am
a
soldier
in
this
army
and
to
help
me
in
these
researches
i
established
a
laboratory
in
the
it
is
to
the
parasites
of
tuberculosis
and
cancers
that
i
devote
myself
and
for
seven
years
that
is
since
i
was
my
comrades
have
called
me
the
cancer
topic
i
have
discovered
the
parasite
of
the
tuberculosis
but
i
have
not
yet
been
able
to
free
it
from
all
its
impurities
by
the
process
of
culture
i
am
still
at
it
that
is
to
say
i
am
very
near
it
and
perhaps
or
in
a
few
days
i
may
make
a
discovery
that
will
be
a
revolution
and
cover
its
discoverer
with
glory
the
same
with
the
cancer
i
have
found
its
microbe
but
all
is
not
done
see
what
i
must
give
up
in
leaving
give
all
this
up
could
you
not
continue
your
researches
in
auvergne
is
impossible
for
many
reasons
that
are
too
long
to
explain
but
one
will
suffice
the
culture
of
these
parasites
can
be
done
only
in
certain
temperatures
rigorously
maintained
at
the
necessary
degree
and
these
temperatures
can
be
obtained
only
by
stoves
like
the
one
in
my
laboratory
fed
by
gas
the
entrance
of
which
is
automatically
regulated
by
the
temperature
of
the
water
how
could
i
use
this
stove
in
a
country
where
there
is
no
gas
no
no
if
i
leave
paris
everything
is
at
an
end
my
position
as
well
as
my
work
i
shall
become
a
country
doctor
and
nothing
but
a
country
doctor
let
the
sheriff
turn
me
out
and
all
the
four
accumulations
in
my
laboratory
all
my
works
en
train
that
demand
only
a
few
days
or
hours
to
complete
may
go
to
the
dealer
or
be
thrown
into
the
street
of
all
my
efforts
weary
nights
privations
and
hopes
there
remains
only
one
souvenir
for
me
and
yet
if
it
did
not
remain
perhaps
i
should
be
less
exasperated
and
should
accept
with
a
heart
less
sore
the
life
to
which
i
shall
never
resign
myself
you
know
very
well
that
i
am
a
rebel
and
do
not
submit
she
rose
and
taking
his
hand
pressed
it
closely
in
her
own
must
stay
in
paris
she
said
me
for
having
insisted
that
you
could
live
in
the
country
i
thought
more
of
myself
than
of
you
of
our
love
and
our
marriage
it
was
an
egotistic
thought
a
bad
thought
a
way
must
be
found
no
matter
what
it
costs
to
enable
you
to
continue
your
how
to
find
it
do
you
think
i
have
not
tried
everything
he
related
his
visits
to
jardine
his
solicitations
prayers
and
also
his
request
of
a
loan
from
glady
and
his
visit
to
caffie
she
cried
made
you
think
of
going
to
caffie
went
partly
because
you
had
often
spoken
of
i
spoke
of
him
to
you
as
the
most
wicked
of
men
capable
of
anything
and
everything
that
is
partly
also
because
i
knew
from
one
of
my
patients
that
he
lends
to
those
of
whom
he
can
make
did
he
say
to
you
it
was
probable
he
would
not
be
able
to
find
any
one
who
would
lend
what
i
wished
but
he
would
try
to
find
some
one
and
would
give
me
an
answer
tomorrow
evening
he
also
promised
to
protect
me
from
have
put
yourself
in
his
hands
what
do
you
expect
in
my
position
i
am
not
at
liberty
to
go
to
whom
i
wish
and
to
those
who
inspire
me
with
confidence
in
their
honor
if
i
should
go
to
a
notary
or
a
banker
they
would
not
listen
to
me
for
i
should
be
obliged
to
tell
them
the
first
thing
that
i
have
no
security
to
offer
that
is
how
the
unfortunate
fall
into
the
hands
of
rascals
at
least
these
listen
to
them
and
lend
them
something
small
though
it
may
did
he
give
you
you
took
it
is
time
gained
perhaps
i
shall
be
turned
into
the
street
caffie
will
obtain
a
what
price
will
he
ask
for
this
service
is
only
those
who
own
something
who
worry
about
the
have
your
name
dignity
and
honor
and
once
you
are
in
caffies
hands
who
knows
what
he
may
exact
from
you
what
he
may
make
you
do
without
your
being
able
to
resist
him
you
wish
me
to
leave
paris
not
but
i
wish
you
to
be
on
your
guard
against
caffie
whom
you
do
not
know
but
i
do
through
what
florentin
told
us
when
he
was
with
him
however
secret
a
man
may
be
he
can
not
hide
himself
from
his
clerk
he
is
not
only
guilty
of
rascalities
but
also
of
real
crimes
i
assure
you
that
he
deserves
ten
deaths
to
gain
a
hundred
francs
he
will
do
anything
he
makes
money
only
for
the
pleasure
of
making
it
for
he
has
neither
child
nor
i
promise
to
be
on
my
guard
as
you
advise
but
wicked
as
caffie
may
be
i
believe
that
i
shall
accept
the
concours
that
he
offered
me
who
knows
what
may
happen
in
the
short
time
that
he
gains
for
me
because
i
need
not
tell
you
that
i
know
beforehand
what
his
reply
will
be
to
my
request
for
a
loan
he
could
find
no
shall
come
all
the
same
evening
to
learn
his
chapter
ix
answer
although
saniel
did
not
build
any
false
hopes
on
reply
he
went
to
see
him
the
next
afternoon
at
the
same
hour
as
before
he
waited
some
time
after
ringing
the
bell
at
last
he
heard
a
slow
step
within
is
there
caffie
asked
as
soon
as
saniel
answered
the
door
was
opened
i
do
not
like
to
be
disturbed
in
the
evening
by
troublesome
people
i
do
not
always
open
the
door
caffie
said
i
have
a
signal
for
my
clients
so
that
i
may
know
them
after
ringing
knock
three
times
on
the
during
this
explanation
they
entered
office
you
done
anything
about
my
affair
saniel
asked
after
a
moment
as
caffie
seemed
disinclined
to
open
the
conversation
my
dear
sir
i
have
been
running
about
all
the
morning
for
you
i
never
neglect
my
clients
their
affairs
are
he
paused
saniel
said
caffie
put
on
an
expression
of
despair
did
i
tell
you
my
dear
sir
do
you
remember
do
me
the
honor
to
believe
that
a
man
of
my
experience
does
not
speak
lightly
what
i
foresaw
has
come
to
pass
everywhere
i
received
the
same
reply
the
risk
is
too
great
no
one
would
take
even
for
a
large
interest
even
for
a
large
interest
there
is
so
much
competition
in
your
profession
as
for
me
i
believe
in
your
future
and
i
have
proved
it
by
my
proposition
but
unfortunately
i
am
only
an
intermediary
and
not
the
lender
of
caffie
emphasized
the
words
proposition
and
underlined
them
with
a
glance
but
saniel
did
not
appear
to
understand
the
summons
he
asked
may
be
easy
on
that
point
i
have
attended
to
it
your
landlord
to
whom
he
owes
rent
will
interfere
and
your
creditor
must
indemnify
him
before
going
farther
will
he
submit
we
shall
see
if
he
does
we
shall
defend
ourselves
on
some
other
ground
i
do
not
say
victoriously
but
in
a
way
to
gain
much
time
my
dear
sir
i
do
not
know
the
whole
thing
depends
upon
our
adversary
but
what
do
you
mean
by
much
time
eternity
mean
until
is
eternity
do
you
believe
that
you
will
be
able
to
free
yourself
in
april
if
you
have
expectations
founded
on
something
substantial
you
should
tell
me
what
they
are
my
dear
this
question
was
put
with
such
an
air
of
benevolence
that
saniel
was
taken
in
by
it
have
no
guarantee
he
said
on
the
other
hand
it
is
of
the
utmost
importance
to
me
that
i
should
have
this
length
of
time
as
i
have
explained
to
you
i
am
about
to
pass
two
examinations
they
will
last
three
months
and
in
march
or
at
the
latest
in
april
i
shall
be
a
physician
of
the
hospitals
and
fellow
of
the
faculty
in
that
case
i
should
then
offer
a
surface
to
the
lenders
that
would
permit
you
without
doubt
to
find
the
sum
necessary
to
pay
jardine
whatever
expenses
there
may
be
and
your
as
he
spoke
saniel
saw
that
he
was
wrong
in
thus
committing
himself
but
he
continued
to
the
end
should
be
unworthy
of
your
confidence
my
dear
sir
caffie
replied
i
encouraged
you
with
the
idea
that
we
could
gain
so
much
time
whatever
it
costs
me
and
it
costs
me
much
i
assure
you
i
must
tell
you
that
it
is
impossible
radically
impossible
a
few
days
yes
or
a
few
weeks
but
that
is
obtain
a
few
weeks
saniel
said
rising
will
be
afterward
shall
dear
sir
do
not
go
you
would
not
believe
how
much
i
am
touched
by
your
position
i
think
only
of
you
when
i
learned
that
i
could
not
find
the
sum
you
desire
i
paid
a
friendly
visit
to
my
young
client
of
whom
i
spoke
to
you
one
who
received
a
superior
education
in
a
fashionable
convent
and
i
asked
her
what
she
would
think
of
a
young
doctor
full
of
talent
future
professor
of
the
faculty
actually
considered
already
a
savant
of
the
first
order
handsome
because
you
are
handsome
my
dear
sir
and
it
is
no
flattery
to
say
this
in
good
health
a
peasant
by
birth
who
presented
himself
as
a
husband
she
appeared
flattered
i
tell
you
frankly
but
immediately
afterward
she
said
the
child
to
which
i
replied
that
you
were
too
good
too
noble
too
generous
not
to
have
the
indulgence
of
superior
men
who
accept
an
involuntary
fault
with
serenity
did
i
go
too
far
he
did
not
wait
for
an
answer
he
went
on
the
child
was
present
for
the
mother
watches
over
it
with
a
solicitude
that
promises
much
for
the
future
and
i
examined
it
leisurely
it
is
very
delicate
my
dear
sir
and
like
its
father
the
poor
baby
i
doubt
if
you
with
all
your
skill
can
make
it
live
if
it
should
die
as
it
is
to
be
feared
it
will
it
would
not
injure
your
reputation
you
can
give
it
care
but
not
of
health
interrupted
saniel
who
did
not
wish
to
reply
you
do
what
i
advised
about
yourself
yet
the
chemists
of
this
quarter
are
only
licensed
cutthroats
but
i
am
going
this
evening
to
see
one
of
my
clients
who
is
a
chemist
and
he
will
deal
honestly
with
will
see
you
again
you
wish
my
dear
sir
when
you
have
reflected
you
have
the
before
leaving
home
saniel
gave
his
key
to
the
concierge
so
that
on
her
arrival
phillis
might
go
immediately
to
his
rooms
on
his
return
the
concierge
told
him
that
was
and
when
he
rang
the
bell
phillis
opened
the
door
she
asked
in
a
trembling
voice
before
he
had
time
to
enter
is
as
i
told
you
yesterday
he
has
found
no
she
clasped
him
in
a
long
passionate
embrace
the
upholsterer
has
promised
to
gain
some
time
for
while
speaking
they
entered
the
office
a
fire
burned
on
the
hearth
and
an
inviting
dinner
was
on
the
table
saniel
looked
at
it
in
surprise
have
set
the
table
you
see
i
am
going
to
dine
with
and
throwing
herself
in
his
arms
caffie
better
than
you
do
i
knew
what
his
answer
would
be
and
i
did
not
wish
you
to
be
alone
on
your
return
i
made
an
excuse
for
not
dining
with
this
chicken
must
have
a
piece
de
fire
and
these
candles
that
is
the
end
of
my
economies
i
should
have
been
so
happy
if
they
had
been
less
miserable
and
more
as
on
the
previous
evening
they
sat
before
the
fire
and
she
began
to
talk
of
various
things
in
order
to
distract
him
but
what
their
lips
did
not
say
their
eyes
on
meeting
expressed
with
more
intensity
than
words
could
do
it
was
saniel
who
suddenly
betrayed
his
preoccupation
brother
studied
caffie
well
he
said
as
if
speaking
to
himself
did
indeed
is
certainly
the
most
thorough
rascal
that
i
have
ever
proposed
something
infamous
i
am
proposed
that
i
should
suspected
is
the
reason
why
he
refuses
to
lend
me
the
money
i
was
foolish
enough
to
tell
him
frankly
just
how
i
am
situated
and
how
important
it
is
for
me
to
be
free
until
april
he
hopes
that
i
shall
be
so
pushed
that
i
will
accept
one
of
the
women
whom
he
has
proposed
to
me
with
the
knife
at
my
throat
i
should
have
to
these
women
she
asked
not
daring
to
look
at
him
not
be
alarmed
you
have
nothing
to
fear
one
is
the
drunken
widow
of
a
butcher
and
the
other
is
a
young
girl
who
has
a
dares
to
propose
such
women
to
a
man
like
you
and
saniel
repeated
all
that
caffie
had
said
to
him
about
these
two
women
a
monster
he
is
phillis
said
he
was
telling
me
these
things
i
thought
of
what
you
said
that
if
some
one
killed
him
it
would
be
no
more
than
he
is
perfectly
would
have
been
easier
than
for
me
to
have
made
away
with
him
he
had
the
toothache
and
when
he
showed
me
his
teeth
i
could
easily
have
strangled
him
we
were
alone
and
a
miserable
diabetic
such
as
he
is
who
has
not
more
than
six
months
to
live
i
am
sure
could
not
have
resisted
a
grasp
like
this
i
could
take
his
keys
from
his
pocket
open
his
safe
and
take
the
thirty
forty
sixty
thousand
francs
that
i
saw
heaped
up
there
the
devil
take
me
if
it
were
ever
discovered
a
doctor
does
not
strangle
his
patients
he
poisons
them
he
kills
them
scientifically
not
who
have
no
conscience
can
do
such
things
but
for
us
they
are
assure
you
it
is
not
conscience
that
would
have
restrained
fear
of
remorse
if
i
may
use
an
ugly
intelligent
persons
have
no
remorse
my
dear
child
because
they
reason
before
the
deed
and
not
after
before
acting
they
weigh
the
pros
and
cons
and
know
what
the
consequences
of
their
actions
will
be
to
others
as
well
as
to
themselves
if
this
previous
examination
proves
to
them
that
for
some
reason
or
other
they
may
act
they
will
always
be
calm
assured
that
they
will
feel
no
remorse
which
is
only
the
reproach
of
doubt
what
you
say
is
to
the
point
but
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
accept
it
if
i
have
never
committed
crimes
i
have
often
been
foolish
and
have
committed
faults
many
of
them
deliberately
after
the
examination
of
which
you
speak
i
should
have
been
according
to
you
perfectly
placid
and
free
from
the
reproach
of
conscience
however
the
next
morning
i
woke
unhappy
tormented
often
overwhelmed
and
unable
to
stifle
the
mysterious
voice
that
accused
in
whose
name
did
it
speak
this
voice
more
vague
than
mysterious
the
name
of
my
conscience
is
too
much
and
you
would
be
puzzled
if
called
upon
to
demonstrate
this
evidence
whereas
nothing
is
more
uncertain
and
elusive
than
the
thing
that
is
called
conscience
which
is
in
reality
only
an
affair
of
environment
and
of
do
not
your
conscience
tell
you
it
is
a
crime
to
love
me
see
then
that
you
have
a
personal
way
of
understanding
what
is
good
and
bad
which
is
not
that
of
our
country
where
it
is
admitted
from
the
religious
and
from
the
social
point
of
view
that
a
young
girl
is
guilty
when
she
has
a
lover
of
course
you
see
also
that
conscience
is
a
bad
since
each
one
in
order
to
make
it
work
uses
a
weight
that
he
has
himself
it
is
you
did
right
not
to
strangle
you
yourself
have
condemned
to
the
hand
of
justice
whether
human
or
divine
but
not
by
yours
any
more
than
by
or
mine
although
we
know
better
than
any
one
that
he
does
not
deserve
any
you
see
i
foresaw
your
objections
as
i
did
not
tighten
his
it
necessary
to
say
chapter
saniel
makes
a
resolution
this
evening
phillis
was
obliged
to
be
at
home
early
but
she
cleared
off
the
table
and
put
everything
in
order
before
leaving
can
breakfast
on
the
remains
of
the
chicken
she
said
as
she
put
it
in
the
pantry
and
as
saniel
accompanied
her
with
a
candle
in
his
hand
he
saw
that
she
had
thought
not
only
of
his
breakfast
for
the
following
day
but
for
many
days
besides
carrots
for
the
rabbits
a
good
heart
you
have
he
said
i
think
of
the
rabbits
of
your
tenderness
and
wish
i
could
do
something
for
you
as
soon
as
she
was
gone
he
seated
himself
at
his
desk
and
began
to
work
anxious
to
make
up
for
the
time
that
he
had
given
to
sentiment
the
fact
that
his
work
might
not
be
of
use
to
him
and
that
his
experiments
might
be
rudely
interrupted
the
next
morning
or
in
a
few
days
was
not
a
sufficient
reason
for
being
idle
he
had
work
to
do
and
he
worked
as
if
with
the
certitude
that
he
would
pass
his
examinations
and
that
his
experiments
of
four
years
past
would
have
a
good
ending
without
interference
from
any
one
this
was
his
strong
point
this
power
to
work
that
was
never
disturbed
or
weakened
by
anything
not
by
pleasure
or
pain
by
preoccupation
or
by
misery
in
the
street
he
could
think
of
phillis
be
he
hungry
or
sleepy
at
his
desk
he
had
no
thought
of
phillis
neither
of
hunger
nor
of
sleep
no
cares
no
memories
his
work
occupied
him
entirely
it
was
his
strength
and
also
his
pride
the
only
superiority
of
which
he
boasted
for
although
he
knew
that
he
had
others
he
never
spoke
of
them
while
he
often
said
to
his
comrades
work
when
i
will
and
as
much
as
i
wish
my
will
never
weakens
when
i
am
at
this
evening
he
worked
for
about
an
hour
in
his
usual
condition
of
mind
neither
sheriffs
nor
jardine
nor
caffie
troubled
him
but
having
to
draw
upon
his
memory
for
certain
facts
he
found
that
it
did
not
obey
him
as
usual
there
were
a
hesitation
a
fogginess
above
all
extraordinary
wanderings
he
wrestled
with
it
and
it
obeyed
but
only
for
a
short
time
and
soon
again
it
betrayed
him
a
second
time
then
a
third
and
fourth
time
decidedly
he
was
not
in
a
normal
state
and
his
will
obeyed
in
place
of
commanding
there
were
a
name
and
a
phrase
that
recurred
to
him
mechanically
from
time
to
time
the
name
was
caffie
and
the
phrase
was
why
should
this
hypothesis
to
strangle
caffie
of
which
he
had
lightly
spoken
and
to
which
he
had
attached
no
importance
at
the
moment
when
he
uttered
it
return
to
him
in
this
way
as
a
sort
of
obsession
was
it
not
strange
never
until
this
day
had
he
had
an
idea
that
he
could
strangle
a
man
even
as
wicked
as
this
one
and
yet
in
talking
of
it
he
found
very
natural
and
legitimate
reasons
for
the
murder
of
this
scamp
had
not
phillis
herself
condemned
him
to
tell
the
truth
she
had
added
that
providence
or
justice
should
be
his
executor
but
this
was
the
scruple
of
a
simple
conscience
formed
in
a
narrow
environment
to
which
influence
he
would
not
submit
had
he
these
scruples
this
old
man
who
coldly
and
merely
for
the
interest
of
so
much
a
hundred
on
a
dot
advised
him
to
hasten
the
death
of
a
woman
by
drunkenness
and
that
of
an
infant
in
any
way
he
pleased
when
he
reached
this
conclusion
he
stopped
and
asked
himself
whether
he
were
mad
to
pursue
this
idea
then
immediately
to
get
rid
of
it
he
set
to
work
which
absorbed
him
for
a
certain
time
but
not
so
long
a
time
as
at
first
then
finding
that
he
could
not
control
his
will
he
turned
his
thoughts
to
caffie
it
was
only
too
evident
that
if
he
had
carried
out
the
idea
of
strangling
caffie
all
the
difficulties
against
which
he
had
struggled
and
which
would
overwhelm
him
if
not
the
following
day
at
least
in
a
few
days
would
have
disappeared
immediately
no
more
sheriffs
no
more
creditors
what
a
deliverance
repose
the
possibility
of
passing
examinations
with
a
calm
spirit
that
the
fever
of
material
troubles
would
not
disturb
in
this
condition
he
felt
his
success
was
assured
and
his
experiments
he
would
run
no
danger
of
seeing
them
rudely
interrupted
his
preparations
were
not
cast
his
precious
were
not
broken
his
vases
his
balloons
were
not
at
the
he
continued
this
train
of
thought
to
the
results
that
he
desired
for
him
glory
for
humanity
the
cure
of
one
and
perhaps
two
of
the
most
terrible
maladies
with
which
it
was
afflicted
the
question
was
simple
on
one
side
caffie
on
the
other
side
humanity
and
science
an
old
rascal
who
deserved
twenty
deaths
and
who
would
anyhow
die
naturally
in
a
short
time
and
humanity
science
which
would
profit
by
a
discovery
of
which
he
would
be
the
author
he
saw
that
the
perspiration
stood
out
on
his
hands
and
he
felt
it
run
down
his
neck
why
this
weakness
from
horror
of
the
crime
the
possibility
of
which
he
admitted
or
from
fear
of
seeing
his
experiments
destroyed
he
would
reflect
think
about
it
be
upon
his
guard
he
had
told
phillis
that
intelligent
men
before
engaging
in
an
action
weigh
the
pro
and
con
against
death
he
saw
nothing
for
on
the
contrary
everything
combined
if
he
had
had
scruples
or
beliefs
he
would
have
stopped
but
not
having
them
would
he
not
be
silly
to
draw
back
before
what
should
he
shrink
why
should
he
stop
remorse
but
he
was
convinced
that
intelligent
men
had
no
remorse
when
they
came
to
a
decision
on
good
grounds
it
was
before
that
they
felt
remorse
not
after
and
he
was
exactly
in
this
period
of
before
fear
of
being
arrested
but
intelligent
men
do
not
let
themselves
be
arrested
those
who
are
lost
are
brutes
who
go
straight
ahead
or
the
who
use
their
skill
and
cunning
to
combine
a
complicated
or
romantic
act
in
which
their
hand
is
plainly
seen
as
for
him
he
was
a
man
of
science
and
precision
and
he
would
not
compromise
himself
by
act
or
sentiment
there
would
be
nothing
to
fear
during
the
action
and
nothing
afterward
caffie
strangled
suspicion
would
not
fall
upon
a
doctor
but
on
a
brute
when
doctors
wish
to
kill
any
one
they
do
it
learnedly
by
poison
or
by
some
scientific
method
brutal
men
kill
brutally
murder
called
the
profession
a
few
minutes
before
he
was
inundated
by
perspiration
this
word
froze
him
he
rose
nervously
and
walked
up
and
down
the
room
with
long
unsteady
steps
the
fire
had
long
since
gone
out
the
street
noises
had
ceased
and
in
his
brain
resounded
the
one
word
that
he
pronounced
in
a
low
tone
was
he
the
man
to
be
influenced
and
stopped
by
a
word
where
are
the
rich
the
men
the
successful
men
who
have
not
left
some
corpses
on
the
road
behind
them
success
carries
them
safely
and
they
achieved
success
only
because
they
had
force
certainly
violence
was
not
recreation
and
it
would
be
more
agreeable
to
go
in
his
way
peacefully
by
the
power
of
intelligence
and
work
than
to
make
a
way
by
blows
but
he
had
not
chosen
this
road
he
was
thrown
into
it
by
circumstances
by
fate
and
whoever
wishes
to
reach
the
end
can
not
choose
the
means
if
one
must
walk
in
the
mud
what
matters
it
when
one
knows
that
one
will
not
get
muddy
if
caffie
had
had
heirs
poor
people
who
expected
to
be
saved
from
misery
by
inheriting
his
fortune
he
would
have
been
touched
by
this
consideration
undoubtedly
robber
the
word
was
yet
more
vile
than
that
of
assassin
but
who
would
miss
the
few
banknotes
that
he
would
take
from
the
safe
to
steal
is
to
injure
some
one
whom
would
he
injure
he
could
see
no
one
but
he
saw
distinctly
an
army
of
afflicted
persons
whom
he
would
benefit
a
timid
ring
of
the
bell
made
him
start
violently
and
he
was
angry
with
himself
for
being
so
nervous
he
who
was
always
master
of
his
mind
as
of
his
body
he
opened
the
door
and
a
man
dressed
like
a
laborer
bowed
humbly
beg
your
pardon
for
disturbing
you
do
you
want
called
on
account
of
my
wife
if
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
come
to
see
is
the
matter
with
her

about
to
be
confined
the
nurse
does
not
know
what
to
do
and
sent
me
for
a
the
nurse

you
to
come
for
me
sir
she
sent
me
to
doctor

told
me
he
could
not
get
up
on
account
of
his
bronchitis
and
the
chemist
gave
me
your

must
tell
you
sir
i
am
an
honest
man
but
we
are
not
rich
we
could
not
pay
you
understand
wait
a
few
saniel
took
his
instruments
and
followed
the
laborer
who
on
the
way
explained
his
condition
are
we
going
saniel
asked
interrupting
these
explanations
de
la
it
was
behind
the
saint
market
on
the
sixth
floor
under
the
roof
in
a
room
that
was
perfectly
clean
in
spite
of
its
poverty
as
soon
as
saniel
entered
the
nurse
came
forward
and
in
a
few
words
told
him
the
trouble
the
child
living
is
well
let
us
he
approached
the
bed
and
made
a
careful
examination
of
the
patient
who
kept
repeating
am
going
to
die
save
me
doctor
we
shall
save
you
he
said
very
softly
promise
he
turned
away
from
the
bed
and
said
to
the
nurse
only
way
to
save
the
mother
is
to
kill
the
the
operation
was
long
difficult
and
painful
and
after
it
was
over
saniel
remained
a
long
time
with
the
patient
when
he
reached
the
street
a
neighboring
clock
struck
five
and
the
had
already
begun
to
show
signs
of
life
but
in
the
streets
was
still
the
silence
and
solitude
of
night
and
saniel
began
to
reflect
on
what
had
occurred
during
the
last
few
hours
thus
he
had
not
hesitated
to
kill
this
child
who
had
perhaps
sixty
or
seventy
years
of
happy
life
before
it
and
he
hesitated
at
the
death
of
caffie
to
whom
remained
only
a
miserable
existence
of
a
few
weeks
the
interests
of
a
poor
weak
stunted
woman
had
decided
him
his
those
of
humanity
left
him
perplexed
irresolute
weak
and
cowardly
what
a
contradiction
he
walked
with
his
eyes
lowered
and
at
this
moment
before
him
on
the
pavement
he
saw
an
object
that
glittered
in
the
glare
of
the
gas
he
approached
it
and
found
that
it
was
a
knife
that
must
have
been
lost
either
on
going
to
the
market
or
the
slaughterhouse
he
hesitated
a
moment
whether
he
should
pick
it
up
or
leave
it
there
then
looking
all
about
him
and
seeing
no
one
in
the
deserted
street
and
hearing
no
sound
of
footsteps
in
the
silence
he
bent
quickly
and
took
it
fate
was
decided
book
chapter
xi
the
instrument
of
death
when
after
two
sleep
saniel
woke
he
did
not
at
first
think
of
this
knife
he
was
tired
and
dull
mechanically
he
walked
about
his
room
without
paying
attention
to
what
he
was
doing
as
if
he
were
in
a
state
of
somnambulism
and
it
astonished
him
because
he
never
felt
weariness
of
mind
any
more
than
of
body
no
matter
how
little
he
had
slept
nor
how
hard
he
had
worked
but
suddenly
catching
a
glimpse
of
the
knife
that
he
had
placed
on
the
mantel
he
received
a
shock
that
annihilated
his
torpor
and
his
fatigue
it
dazzled
him
like
a
flash
of
lightning
he
took
it
and
going
to
the
window
he
examined
it
by
the
pale
light
of
early
morning
it
was
a
strong
instrument
that
in
a
firm
hand
would
be
a
terrible
arm
newly
sharpened
it
had
the
edge
of
a
razor
then
the
idea
the
vision
that
had
come
to
him
two
hours
before
came
back
to
him
clear
and
complete
at
nightfall
that
is
at
the
moment
when
the
concierge
was
in
the
second
wing
of
the
building
he
mounted
to
apartment
without
being
seen
and
with
this
knife
he
cut
his
throat
it
was
as
simple
as
it
was
easy
and
this
knife
left
beside
the
corpse
and
the
nature
of
the
wound
would
lead
the
police
to
look
for
a
butcher
or
at
least
a
man
who
was
in
the
habit
of
using
a
knife
of
this
kind
the
evening
before
when
he
had
discussed
death
the
how
and
the
when
still
remained
vague
and
uncertain
but
now
the
day
and
the
means
were
definitely
settled
it
should
be
with
this
knife
and
this
evening
this
shook
him
out
of
his
torpor
and
made
him
shudder
he
was
angry
with
himself
for
this
weakness
did
he
know
or
did
he
not
know
what
he
wished
was
he
irresolute
or
cowardly
then
going
from
one
idea
to
another
he
thought
of
an
observation
that
he
had
made
which
appeared
to
prove
that
with
many
subjects
there
is
less
firmness
in
the
morning
than
in
the
evening
was
this
the
result
of
dualism
of
the
nervous
centres
and
was
the
human
personality
double
like
the
brain
were
there
hours
when
the
right
hemisphere
is
master
of
our
will
and
were
there
other
hours
when
the
left
is
master
did
one
of
these
hemispheres
possess
what
the
other
lacked
and
is
it
according
to
the
activity
of
this
or
that
one
that
one
has
such
a
character
or
such
a
temperament
this
would
be
curious
and
would
amount
to
saying
that
a
lamb
in
the
morning
one
might
be
a
tiger
at
evening
with
him
it
was
a
lamb
that
woke
in
the
morning
to
be
devoured
by
a
tiger
during
the
day
to
which
hemisphere
belonged
the
one
and
the
other
of
these
personalities
he
was
angry
with
himself
for
yielding
to
these
reflections
it
was
a
time
truly
to
study
this
psychological
question
it
was
of
caffie
that
he
should
think
and
of
the
plan
which
in
an
instant
flashed
through
his
mind
in
the
street
before
he
decided
to
pick
up
this
knife
evidently
things
were
neither
so
simple
nor
so
easy
as
they
at
first
appeared
and
to
insure
the
success
of
his
plan
a
combination
of
circumstances
was
necessary
which
might
be
difficult
to
bring
about
would
not
the
concierge
see
him
pass
would
no
one
go
up
or
down
the
stairs
would
caffie
be
alone
would
he
open
the
door
might
not
some
one
ring
after
he
had
entered
here
was
a
series
of
questions
that
he
had
not
thought
of
before
but
which
now
presented
itself
he
must
examine
them
weigh
them
and
not
throw
himself
giddily
into
an
adventure
that
presented
such
risks
he
was
alone
all
day
fortunately
and
as
in
the
state
of
agitation
in
which
he
found
himself
he
could
not
think
of
work
he
gave
himself
up
to
this
examination
the
stakes
were
worth
the
trouble
his
honor
and
his
life
as
soon
as
he
was
dressed
he
went
out
and
walked
straight
before
him
through
the
streets
that
were
already
filled
with
people
it
was
only
when
he
had
left
the
heart
of
paris
that
he
could
reflect
as
he
wished
without
being
disturbed
each
instant
by
people
in
a
hurry
for
whom
he
must
make
way
or
by
others
who
reading
the
newspapers
did
not
look
before
them
and
so
jostled
against
him
evidently
the
risks
were
more
serious
than
he
had
imagined
and
as
they
loomed
up
before
him
he
asked
himself
whether
he
should
go
on
to
suppress
caffie
yes
to
give
himself
up
no
it
is
impossible
he
was
not
the
man
to
set
himself
wildly
against
the
impossible
he
should
have
had
a
dream
a
bad
dream
and
that
would
be
all
he
stopped
and
after
a
moment
of
hesitation
turning
on
his
heel
he
retraced
his
steps
of
what
use
was
it
to
go
farther
he
had
no
need
to
reflect
nor
to
weigh
the
pro
and
con
he
must
give
up
this
plan
decidedly
it
was
too
dangerous
he
had
gone
but
a
short
distance
when
he
asked
himself
whether
these
dangers
were
such
as
he
saw
them
and
whether
he
were
face
to
face
with
a
radically
demonstrated
impossibility
without
doubt
the
concierge
might
observe
him
when
he
passed
her
lodge
either
on
going
or
coming
down
and
also
she
might
not
observe
him
this
in
reality
depended
much
upon
himself
and
on
his
method
of
proceeding
every
evening
this
lame
old
concierge
lighted
the
gas
in
the
two
wings
of
the
building
one
on
the
street
and
one
on
the
court
she
began
by
lighting
that
on
the
street
and
with
the
difficulty
that
she
found
in
walking
it
should
take
her
some
time
to
climb
the
five
stories
and
to
descend
if
one
watched
from
the
street
when
at
dusk
she
left
her
lodge
with
a
wax
taper
in
her
hand
and
mounted
the
stairs
behind
her
at
a
little
distance
in
such
a
way
as
to
be
on
the
landing
of
the
first
story
when
she
should
reach
the
second
there
would
be
time
the
deed
done
to
regain
the
street
before
she
returned
to
her
lodge
after
having
lighted
the
gas
on
the
two
staircases
it
was
important
to
proceed
methodically
without
hurry
but
also
without
loitering
was
this
impossible
here
exactly
was
the
delicate
point
which
he
must
examine
with
composure
without
permitting
himself
to
be
influenced
by
any
other
consideration
than
that
which
sprang
from
the
deed
itself
he
was
wrong
then
not
to
continue
his
route
and
it
was
better
assuredly
to
get
out
of
paris
in
the
country
in
the
fields
or
woods
he
could
find
the
calm
that
was
indispensable
to
his
brain
in
which
ideas
clashed
like
the
waves
of
a
disturbed
sea
he
was
at
this
moment
in
the
middle
of
the
faubourg
saint
honore
he
followed
a
street
that
would
bring
him
to
the
champs
elysees
a
desert
at
this
early
hour
it
took
him
some
time
to
examine
all
the
hypotheses
that
might
present
themselves
and
he
reached
the
conclusion
that
what
had
appeared
impossible
to
him
was
not
so
if
he
preserved
his
calmness
and
did
not
lose
perception
of
the
passing
time
he
could
very
well
escape
the
concierge
which
was
the
main
point
to
tell
the
truth
the
danger
of
the
concierge
removed
all
was
not
easy
there
was
the
possibility
of
meeting
one
of
the
lodgers
on
the
stairs
there
was
a
chance
of
not
finding
caffie
at
home
or
at
least
not
alone
or
the
bell
might
ring
at
the
decisive
moment
but
as
everything
depended
upon
chance
these
circumstances
could
not
be
decided
beforehand
it
was
a
risk
if
one
of
them
happened
he
would
wait
until
the
next
day
it
would
be
one
more
day
of
agitation
to
live
through
but
one
question
that
should
be
decided
in
advance
because
surely
it
presented
serious
dangers
was
how
he
should
justify
the
coming
into
his
hands
of
a
sum
of
money
which
providentially
and
in
the
nick
of
time
relieved
him
from
the
embarrassments
against
which
he
struggled
he
had
reached
the
bois
de
boulogne
and
still
continued
his
walk
in
passing
a
fountain
the
rippling
of
the
water
attracted
his
attention
and
he
stopped
although
the
weather
was
damp
and
cold
under
the
influence
of
a
strong
west
wind
charged
with
rain
his
tongue
was
dry
he
drank
two
goblets
of
water
and
then
pursued
his
way
indifferent
where
he
went
then
he
built
up
an
arrangement
which
appeared
ingenious
to
him
when
it
occurred
to
him
to
remember
that
he
had
gone
to
caffie
to
borrow
three
thousand
francs
why
would
he
not
lend
it
to
him
if
not
the
first
day
at
least
the
second
with
this
loan
he
paid
his
debts
if
he
were
questioned
on
this
point
to
prove
this
loan
he
need
only
to
sign
a
receipt
which
he
could
place
in
the
safe
and
which
would
be
found
there
would
not
the
first
thought
of
those
who
had
signed
a
paper
of
this
kind
be
to
take
it
when
an
occasion
presented
itself
as
he
would
not
seize
this
occasion
to
carry
off
his
note
it
would
be
the
proof
that
he
had
not
opened
the
safe
among
other
advantages
this
arrangement
did
away
with
robbery
it
was
only
a
loan
later
he
would
return
these
three
thousand
francs
to
caffies
heirs
so
much
the
worse
for
him
if
it
were
a
forced
loan
on
returning
to
paris
he
would
buy
a
sheet
of
stamped
paper
and
as
he
had
asked
the
price
the
previous
evening
he
knew
that
he
could
afford
the
expense
when
he
reached
saint
cloud
he
entered
a
tavern
and
ordered
some
bread
and
cheese
and
wine
but
if
he
drank
little
he
ate
less
his
parched
throat
refusing
to
swallow
bread
he
took
up
his
march
in
the
clayey
streets
on
the
slope
of
mont
valerian
but
he
was
insensible
to
the
unpleasantness
of
slipping
on
the
soft
soil
and
walked
hither
and
thither
his
only
care
being
not
to
get
too
far
away
from
the
seine
so
that
he
might
enter
paris
before
night
he
was
delighted
since
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
make
out
and
sign
a
receipt
for
the
money
but
on
giving
it
further
consideration
he
perceived
that
it
was
not
so
ingenious
as
he
had
at
first
supposed
do
not
the
dealers
of
stamped
paper
often
number
their
paper
with
this
number
it
would
be
easy
to
find
the
dealer
and
him
who
had
bought
it
and
then
was
it
not
likely
that
a
scrupulous
business
man
like
caffie
would
keep
a
record
of
the
loans
he
made
and
would
not
the
absence
of
this
one
and
the
note
be
sufficient
to
awaken
suspicion
and
to
direct
it
to
him
decidedly
he
only
escaped
one
danger
to
fall
into
another
for
a
moment
he
was
discouraged
but
it
did
not
go
so
far
as
weakness
his
error
had
been
in
imagining
that
the
execution
of
the
idea
that
had
come
to
him
while
picking
up
the
knife
was
as
plain
as
it
was
easy
but
complicated
and
perilous
as
it
was
it
was
not
impossible
the
question
which
finally
stood
before
him
was
to
know
whether
he
possessed
the
force
needed
to
cope
with
these
dangers
and
on
this
ground
hesitation
was
not
possible
to
wish
to
foresee
everything
was
folly
that
which
he
would
not
have
expected
would
come
to
pass
he
returned
toward
paris
and
by
the
pont
de
suresnes
reentered
the
bois
de
boulogne
as
it
was
not
yet
three
he
had
plenty
of
time
to
reach
the
rue
before
night
but
on
the
way
a
heavy
shower
forced
him
to
take
shelter
and
he
watched
the
falling
rain
asking
himself
if
this
accident
which
he
had
not
foreseen
would
not
upset
his
plan
a
man
who
had
received
the
force
of
this
shower
could
not
appear
in
the
street
before
door
without
attracting
the
attention
of
the
and
it
was
important
for
him
that
he
should
not
attract
the
attention
of
any
one
at
length
the
rain
ceased
and
at
twenty
minutes
of
five
he
reached
his
home
there
remained
fifteen
or
twenty
minutes
of
daylight
which
was
more
than
he
needed
he
stuck
the
point
of
the
knife
in
a
cork
and
after
having
placed
it
between
the
folded
leaves
of
a
newspaper
in
the
inside
pocket
of
his
overcoat
he
went
out
chapter
xii
the
crucial
moment
when
he
reached
caffies
door
the
night
had
scarcely
fallen
and
the
streets
were
not
yet
lighted
the
better
and
the
surest
plan
for
him
had
been
to
wait
in
the
across
the
street
from
there
he
could
watch
the
who
would
not
be
able
to
go
out
without
being
seen
by
him
but
though
the
passers
were
few
at
this
moment
they
might
have
observed
him
next
to
this
was
a
small
whose
brilliant
lights
would
cause
him
to
be
seen
quite
plainly
he
therefore
walked
on
but
soon
returned
all
irresolution
all
hesitation
had
disappeared
and
the
only
point
on
which
he
still
questioned
himself
bore
upon
the
state
in
which
he
found
himself
at
this
moment
he
felt
himself
firm
and
his
pulse
he
was
certain
beat
regularly
he
was
as
he
had
imagined
he
would
be
experience
confirmed
his
foresight
his
hand
would
tremble
no
more
than
his
will
as
he
passed
before
the
house
he
saw
the
concierge
come
slowly
out
of
her
lodge
and
close
her
door
carefully
putting
the
key
in
her
pocket
in
her
left
hand
she
held
something
white
that
he
could
not
see
distinctly
in
the
twilight
but
it
was
probably
the
which
doubtless
she
had
not
lighted
for
fear
the
wind
would
blow
it
out
this
was
a
favorable
circumstance
that
gave
him
one
or
two
minutes
more
than
he
had
counted
on
for
she
would
be
obliged
to
strike
a
match
on
the
stairs
to
light
her
taper
and
in
the
execution
of
his
plan
two
minutes
a
single
minute
even
might
be
of
great
importance
with
dragging
steps
and
bent
back
she
disappeared
through
the
vestibule
of
the
stairway
then
saniel
continued
his
walk
like
an
ordinary
until
she
had
time
to
reach
the
first
story
then
turning
he
returned
to
the
and
entered
quietly
by
the
gaslight
in
the
vestibule
he
saw
by
his
watch
which
he
held
in
his
hand
that
it
was
fourteen
minutes
after
five
then
if
his
calculation
was
right
at
or
minutes
after
five
he
must
pass
before
the
lodge
which
should
still
be
empty
at
that
moment
on
the
staircase
above
him
he
heard
the
heavy
step
of
the
concierge
she
had
lighted
the
gas
on
the
first
story
and
continued
on
her
way
slowly
with
rapid
but
light
steps
he
mounted
behind
her
and
on
reaching
door
he
rang
the
bell
taking
care
not
to
ring
too
loudly
or
too
timidly
then
he
knocked
three
times
as
caffie
had
instructed
him
was
caffie
alone
up
to
this
time
all
had
gone
as
he
wished
no
one
in
the
vestibule
no
one
on
the
stairs
fate
was
in
his
favor
would
it
accompany
him
to
the
end
while
he
waited
at
the
door
asking
himself
this
question
an
idea
flashed
into
his
mind
he
would
make
a
last
attempt
if
caffie
consented
to
make
the
loan
he
would
save
himself
if
he
refused
he
condemned
himself
after
several
seconds
that
appeared
like
hours
his
listening
ears
perceived
a
sound
which
announced
that
caffie
was
at
home
a
scratching
of
wood
on
the
tiled
floor
denoted
that
a
chair
had
been
pushed
aside
heavy
dragging
steps
approached
then
the
bolt
creaked
and
the
door
was
opened
cautiously
it
is
you
my
dear
sir
caffie
said
in
surprise
saniel
entered
briskly
and
closed
the
door
himself
pressing
it
firmly
there
anything
new
caffie
asked
as
he
led
the
way
to
his
office
saniel
replied
then
caffie
asked
as
he
seated
himself
in
an
armchair
before
his
desk
on
which
stood
a
lighted
lamp
suppose
you
have
come
to
hear
more
about
my
young
friend
this
hurry
augurs
it
is
not
of
the
young
person
that
i
wish
to
talk
to
am
on
seating
himself
opposite
to
caffie
saniel
had
taken
out
his
watch
two
minutes
had
passed
since
he
left
the
vestibule
he
must
hurry
in
order
to
keep
himself
informed
of
the
passing
of
time
he
retained
his
watch
in
his
hand
you
in
a
hurry
i
will
come
immediately
to
business
it
concerns
myself
my
position
and
i
make
a
last
appeal
to
you
let
us
be
honest
with
each
other
undoubtedly
you
think
that
pushed
by
my
distress
and
seeing
that
i
shall
be
lost
forever
i
shall
decide
to
accept
this
marriage
to
save
you
suppose
such
a
thing
my
dear
sir
caffie
cried
but
saniel
stopped
him
calculation
is
too
natural
for
you
not
to
have
made
it
well
i
must
tell
you
that
it
is
false
never
will
i
lend
myself
to
such
a
bargain
renounce
your
project
and
let
us
discuss
my
demand
i
am
in
absolute
want
of
three
thousand
francs
and
i
will
pay
the
interest
that
you
fix
have
not
found
a
my
dear
sir
i
have
taken
a
great
deal
of
trouble
i
assure
you
but
i
did
not
an
effort
my
dear
sir
address
myself
to
i
have
no
ready
is
a
desperate
appeal
that
i
make
i
understand
that
your
long
experience
in
business
makes
you
insensible
to
the
misery
that
you
see
every
day
say
that
it
breaks
my
heart
my
dear
will
you
not
permit
yourself
to
be
touched
by
the
misery
of
a
man
who
is
young
intelligent
courageous
who
will
drown
if
a
hand
is
not
held
out
to
help
him
for
you
the
assistance
that
i
ask
so
earnestly
is
nothing
thousand
francs
nothing
bless
me
how
you
talk
me
if
you
refuse
me
it
is
saniel
began
to
speak
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
hands
of
his
watch
but
presently
carried
away
by
the
fever
of
the
situation
he
raised
them
to
look
at
caffie
and
to
see
the
effect
that
he
produced
on
him
in
this
movement
he
made
a
discovery
that
destroyed
all
his
calculations
office
was
a
small
room
with
a
high
window
looking
into
the
court
never
having
been
in
this
office
except
in
the
evening
he
had
not
observed
that
this
window
had
neither
shutters
nor
curtains
of
muslin
or
of
heavier
stuff
there
was
nothing
but
the
glass
to
tell
the
truth
two
heavy
curtains
of
woollen
damask
hung
on
either
side
of
the
window
but
they
were
not
drawn
talking
to
caffie
who
was
placed
between
him
and
this
window
saniel
suddenly
perceived
that
on
the
other
side
of
the
court
in
the
second
wing
of
the
building
on
the
second
story
were
two
lighted
windows
directly
opposite
to
the
office
and
that
from
there
any
one
could
see
everything
that
occurred
in
the
office
how
should
he
execute
his
plan
under
the
eyes
of
these
people
whom
he
saw
coming
and
going
in
this
room
he
would
be
lost
in
any
case
it
was
risking
an
adventure
so
hazardous
that
he
would
be
a
fool
to
attempt
it
and
he
was
not
that
never
had
he
felt
himself
so
much
the
master
of
his
mind
and
nerves
also
it
was
not
only
to
save
life
that
he
argued
it
was
to
save
himself
in
grasping
this
loan
can
only
to
my
great
regret
repeat
to
you
what
i
have
already
said
my
dear
sir
i
have
no
ready
and
he
held
his
jaw
groaning
as
if
this
refusal
aroused
his
toothache
saniel
rose
evidently
there
was
nothing
for
him
to
do
but
to
go
it
was
finished
and
instead
of
being
in
despair
he
felt
it
as
a
relief
but
as
he
was
about
to
leave
the
room
an
idea
flashed
through
his
mind
he
looked
at
his
watch
which
he
had
not
consulted
for
some
time
it
was
twenty
minutes
after
five
there
yet
remained
four
minutes
five
at
the
most
do
you
not
draw
these
curtains
he
said
am
sure
your
sufferings
are
partly
caused
by
the
wind
that
comes
in
this
you
think
so
am
sure
of
it
you
should
be
warm
about
the
head
and
avoid
currents
of
passing
behind
caffie
he
went
to
the
window
to
draw
the
curtains
but
the
cords
would
not
move
is
years
since
they
were
drawn
caffie
said
the
cords
are
entangled
i
will
bring
the
and
taking
the
lamp
he
went
to
the
window
holding
it
high
in
order
to
throw
light
on
the
cords
with
a
turn
of
the
hand
saniel
disentangled
the
cords
and
the
curtains
slid
on
the
rods
almost
covering
the
window
is
true
a
good
deal
of
air
did
come
in
the
window
caffie
said
thank
you
my
dear
all
this
was
done
with
a
feverish
rapidity
that
astonished
caffie
you
are
in
a
hurry
he
said
in
a
great
he
looked
at
his
watch
i
have
still
time
to
give
you
a
consultation
if
you
desire
would
not
trouble
you
do
not
trouble
down
in
your
armchair
and
show
me
your
while
caffie
seated
himself
saniel
continued
in
a
vibrating
voice
see
i
give
good
for
is
that
my
dear
sir
refuse
me
a
service
that
would
save
me
and
i
give
you
a
consultation
it
is
true
it
is
the
why
the
last
my
dear
sir
death
is
between
you
not
see
it
see
must
not
think
of
such
a
thing
my
dear
sir
one
does
not
die
because
one
can
not
pay
three
thousand
the
chair
in
which
caffie
seated
himself
was
an
old
voltaire
with
an
inclined
back
and
he
half
reclined
in
it
as
his
shirtcollar
was
too
large
for
him
since
he
had
become
thin
and
his
narrow
cravat
was
scarcely
tied
he
displayed
as
much
throat
as
jaw
saniel
behind
the
chair
had
taken
the
knife
in
his
right
hand
while
he
pressed
the
left
heavily
on
caffies
forehead
and
with
a
powerful
stroke
as
quick
as
lightning
he
cut
the
larynx
under
the
glottis
as
well
as
the
two
carotid
arteries
with
the
jugular
veins
from
this
terrible
wound
sprang
a
large
jet
of
blood
which
crossing
the
room
struck
against
the
door
cut
clean
not
a
cry
could
be
formed
in
the
windpipe
and
in
his
armchair
caffie
shook
with
convulsions
from
head
to
foot
leaving
his
position
behind
the
chair
saniel
who
had
thrown
the
knife
on
the
floor
looked
at
his
watch
and
counted
the
ticking
of
the
in
a
low
voice
two
at
the
end
of
ninety
seconds
the
convulsions
ceased
it
was
minutes
after
five
now
it
was
important
that
he
should
hurry
and
not
lose
a
second
the
blood
after
having
gushed
out
had
run
down
the
body
and
wet
the
vest
pocket
in
which
was
the
key
of
the
safe
but
blood
does
not
produce
the
same
effect
upon
a
doctor
as
upon
those
who
are
not
accustomed
to
its
sight
and
odor
and
to
its
touch
in
spite
of
the
lukewarm
sea
in
which
it
lay
saniel
took
the
key
and
after
wiping
his
hand
on
one
of
the
tails
of
coat
he
placed
it
in
the
lock
would
it
turn
freely
or
was
it
closed
with
a
combination
the
question
was
poignant
the
key
turned
and
the
door
opened
on
a
shelf
and
in
a
wooden
bowl
were
packages
of
and
rolls
of
gold
that
he
had
seen
the
evening
when
the
came
roughly
without
counting
he
thrust
them
into
his
pocket
and
without
closing
the
safe
he
ran
to
the
front
door
taking
care
not
to
step
in
the
streams
of
blood
which
on
the
sloping
tiled
floor
ran
toward
this
door
the
time
was
short
and
now
was
the
greatest
danger
that
of
meeting
some
one
behind
this
door
or
on
the
stairs
he
listened
and
heard
no
noise
he
went
out
and
no
one
was
to
be
seen
without
running
but
hastily
he
descended
the
stairs
should
he
look
in
the
lodge
or
should
he
turn
his
head
away
he
looked
but
the
concierge
was
not
there
a
second
later
he
was
in
the
street
mingling
with
the
passersby
and
he
drew
a
long
breath
chapter
xiii
distraction
there
was
no
longer
any
need
to
be
cautious
to
listen
to
stretch
his
nerves
to
restrain
his
heart
he
could
walk
freely
and
reflect
his
first
thought
was
to
endeavor
to
explain
to
himself
how
he
felt
and
he
found
that
it
was
an
immense
relief
something
doubtless
analogous
to
the
returning
to
life
after
being
in
a
state
of
asphyxiation
physically
he
was
calm
morally
he
felt
no
remorse
he
was
right
therefore
in
his
theory
when
he
told
phillis
that
in
the
intelligent
man
remorse
precedes
the
action
instead
of
following
it
but
where
he
was
mistaken
was
in
imagining
that
during
the
act
he
should
maintain
his
coolness
and
force
which
in
reality
had
failed
him
completely
going
from
one
idea
to
another
tossed
by
irresolution
he
was
by
no
means
the
strong
man
that
he
had
believed
himself
one
to
go
to
the
end
unmoved
ready
to
face
every
attack
master
of
his
nerves
as
of
his
will
in
full
possession
of
all
his
powers
on
the
contrary
he
had
been
the
plaything
of
agitation
and
weakness
if
a
serious
danger
had
risen
before
him
he
would
not
have
known
on
which
side
to
attack
it
fear
would
have
paralyzed
him
and
he
would
have
been
lost
to
tell
the
truth
his
hand
had
been
firm
but
his
head
had
been
bewildered
there
was
something
humiliating
in
this
he
was
obliged
to
acknowledge
and
what
was
more
serious
it
was
alarming
because
although
everything
had
gone
as
he
wished
up
to
the
present
time
all
was
not
finished
nor
even
begun
if
the
investigations
of
the
law
should
reach
him
how
should
he
defend
himself
he
felt
sure
that
he
had
not
been
seen
in
caffies
house
at
the
moment
when
the
crime
was
committed
but
does
one
ever
know
whether
one
has
been
seen
or
not
and
there
was
the
production
of
money
that
he
should
use
to
pay
his
debts
which
might
become
an
accusation
against
which
it
would
be
difficult
to
defend
himself
in
any
case
he
must
be
ready
to
explain
his
position
and
what
might
complicate
the
matter
was
that
caffie
a
careful
man
had
probably
taken
care
to
write
the
numbers
of
his
in
a
book
which
would
be
found
on
leaving
the
rue
he
took
the
rue
to
his
home
to
leave
the
and
to
wash
off
the
stains
of
blood
that
might
have
splashed
on
him
and
his
hands
particularly
the
right
one
which
was
still
red
but
suddenly
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
might
be
followed
and
it
would
be
folly
to
show
where
he
lived
he
hastened
his
steps
in
order
to
make
any
one
who
might
be
following
him
run
and
took
the
streets
that
were
not
well
lighted
those
where
there
was
little
chance
of
any
one
seeing
the
stains
if
they
were
visible
on
his
clothing
or
boots
he
walked
in
this
way
for
nearly
half
an
hour
turning
and
returning
on
his
track
and
after
having
crossed
the
place
vendome
twice
where
he
was
able
to
look
behind
him
he
decided
to
go
home
not
knowing
whether
he
should
be
satisfied
to
have
bewildered
all
quest
or
whether
he
should
not
be
furious
to
have
yielded
to
a
sort
of
panic
as
he
passed
by
the
lodge
without
stopping
his
concierge
called
him
and
running
out
gave
him
a
letter
with
unusual
eagerness
saniel
who
wished
to
escape
observation
took
it
hastily
and
stuffed
it
into
his
pocket
is
an
important
letter
the
concierge
said
servant
who
brought
it
told
me
that
it
contained
it
needed
this
recommendation
at
such
a
moment
or
saniel
would
not
have
opened
it
which
he
did
as
soon
as
he
entered
his
rooms
do
not
wish
my
dear
doctor
to
leave
paris
for
monaco
where
i
go
to
pass
two
or
three
months
without
sending
you
our
thanks
very
gratefully
these
thanks
were
represented
by
two
bills
of
one
hundred
francs
a
payment
more
than
sufficient
for
the
care
that
saniel
had
given
some
months
before
to
the
mistress
of
this
old
comrade
of
what
use
now
were
these
two
hundred
francs
which
a
few
days
sooner
would
have
been
so
much
to
him
he
threw
them
on
his
desk
and
then
after
having
lighted
two
candles
he
inspected
his
clothing
the
precaution
that
he
had
taken
to
place
himself
behind
the
chair
was
wise
the
blood
in
squirting
in
front
and
on
each
side
had
not
reached
him
only
the
hand
that
held
the
knife
and
the
were
splashed
but
this
was
of
no
consequence
a
doctor
has
the
right
to
have
some
blood
on
his
sleeves
and
this
shirt
went
to
join
the
one
he
had
worn
the
previous
night
when
attending
the
sick
woman
free
from
this
care
he
still
had
the
money
in
his
pockets
he
emptied
them
on
his
desk
and
counted
all
five
rouleaux
of
gold
of
a
thousand
francs
and
three
packages
of
ten
thousand
francs
each
of
how
should
he
get
rid
of
this
sum
all
at
once
and
later
how
should
he
justify
its
production
when
the
moment
came
if
it
came
the
question
was
complex
and
unfortunately
for
him
he
was
hardly
in
a
state
to
consider
it
calmly
for
the
gold
he
had
only
to
burn
the
papers
in
which
it
was
rolled
louis
have
neither
numbers
nor
particular
marks
but
bills
have
where
should
he
conceal
them
while
waiting
to
learn
through
the
newspapers
if
caffie
had
or
had
not
made
a
note
of
these
numbers
while
burning
these
papers
on
which
caffie
had
written
francs
he
tried
to
think
of
a
place
of
concealment
as
he
threw
a
glance
around
him
asking
from
things
the
inspiration
that
his
brain
did
not
furnish
he
caught
sight
of
the
letter
he
had
just
received
and
it
suggested
an
idea
duphot
was
at
monaco
to
play
why
should
he
not
go
also
and
play
having
neither
relatives
nor
friends
from
whom
he
could
procure
a
certain
sum
his
only
resource
was
to
make
it
at
play
and
in
his
desperate
position
known
to
every
one
nothing
was
more
natural
than
this
experiment
he
had
received
two
hundred
francs
which
would
not
save
him
from
his
creditors
he
would
risk
them
at
roulette
at
monaco
whether
he
lost
or
won
was
of
little
consequence
he
would
have
played
that
would
be
sufficient
he
would
be
seen
playing
who
would
know
whether
he
lost
or
won
from
monaco
he
would
pay
jardine
by
telegraph
out
of
the
five
thousand
louis
which
would
be
more
than
sufficient
for
that
and
when
he
returned
to
paris
he
would
free
himself
from
his
other
creditors
with
what
remained
the
money
affair
decided
and
it
seemed
to
him
cleverly
settled
did
not
include
the
which
spread
out
before
his
eyes
disturbed
him
what
should
he
do
with
them
one
moment
he
thought
of
burning
them
but
reflection
held
him
back
would
it
not
be
folly
to
destroy
this
fortune
in
any
case
would
it
not
be
the
work
of
a
narrow
mind
of
one
not
fertile
in
resources
in
trying
to
think
of
some
safe
place
to
hide
the
banknotes
one
thought
continually
absorbed
him
what
was
happening
in
the
rue
had
any
one
discovered
the
dead
man
he
should
be
there
to
observe
events
instead
of
timidly
shutting
himself
up
in
his
office
for
several
minutes
he
tried
to
resist
this
thought
but
it
was
stronger
than
his
will
or
his
reason
so
much
was
he
under
its
power
that
he
could
do
nothing
willing
or
unwilling
foolish
or
not
he
must
go
to
the
rue
he
washed
his
hands
changed
his
shirt
and
throwing
the
notes
and
gold
into
a
drawer
he
went
out
he
knew
very
well
that
there
was
a
certain
danger
in
leaving
these
proofs
of
the
crime
which
found
in
an
official
search
would
overwhelm
him
without
his
being
able
to
defend
himself
but
he
thought
that
an
immediate
search
was
unlikely
to
occur
and
if
he
could
not
make
a
probable
story
it
would
be
better
for
him
not
to
reason
about
it
it
was
a
risk
that
he
ran
but
how
much
he
had
on
his
side
he
hastened
along
the
rue
but
on
approaching
the
rue
he
slackened
his
steps
looking
about
him
and
listening
nothing
unusual
struck
him
even
when
he
turned
into
the
rue
he
found
it
bore
its
ordinary
aspect
a
few
not
curious
no
groups
on
the
sidewalk
no
shopkeepers
at
their
doors
nothing
was
different
from
usual
apparently
nothing
had
yet
been
discovered
then
he
stopped
judging
it
useless
to
go
farther
already
he
had
passed
too
much
time
before
door
and
when
one
was
of
his
build
above
the
medium
height
with
a
physiognomy
and
appearance
unlike
others
one
should
avoid
attracting
attention
for
several
minutes
he
walked
up
and
down
slowly
from
the
rue
to
the
rue
du
hasard
from
there
he
could
see
house
and
yet
be
so
far
away
that
no
one
would
suspect
him
of
watching
it
but
this
promenade
which
was
quite
natural
and
which
he
would
have
continued
for
an
hour
in
ordinary
circumstances
without
thinking
anything
about
it
soon
alarmed
him
it
seemed
as
if
people
looked
at
him
and
two
persons
stopping
to
talk
made
him
wonder
if
they
spoke
of
him
why
did
they
not
continue
their
way
why
from
time
to
time
did
they
turn
their
heads
toward
him
he
left
the
place
and
neither
wishing
nor
being
able
to
decide
to
go
far
away
from
house
he
concluded
to
go
to
a
small
cafe
which
was
close
by
on
entering
he
seated
himself
at
a
table
near
the
door
that
appeared
to
be
an
excellent
observatory
from
where
he
could
easily
survey
the
street
a
waiter
asked
him
what
he
would
have
and
he
ordered
coffee
he
gave
this
order
mechanically
without
thinking
what
he
was
saying
and
not
till
afterward
did
he
wonder
if
it
were
natural
to
take
coffee
at
this
hour
the
men
seated
at
the
other
tables
drank
appetizers
or
beer
had
he
not
made
a
blunder
but
everything
seemed
a
blunder
as
everything
seemed
dangerous
could
he
not
regain
his
composure
and
his
reason
he
drank
his
coffee
slowly
then
he
asked
for
a
newspaper
the
street
was
quiet
and
people
left
the
cafe
one
by
one
behind
his
newspaper
he
reflected
it
was
his
feverish
curiosity
that
made
him
admit
that
death
would
be
discovered
during
the
evening
in
reality
it
might
easily
remain
undiscovered
until
the
next
day
but
he
could
not
stay
in
the
cafe
until
the
next
day
nor
even
until
midnight
perhaps
he
had
remained
there
too
long
already
he
did
not
wish
to
go
yet
so
he
ordered
writing
materials
and
paid
the
waiter
in
case
he
might
wish
to
go
hastily
if
anything
occurred
what
should
he
write
he
wished
to
test
himself
and
found
that
he
was
able
to
write
clearly
and
to
select
the
proper
words
but
when
he
came
to
read
it
over
his
will
failed
him
time
passed
suddenly
there
was
a
movement
under
the
of
house
and
a
man
ran
through
the
street
two
or
three
persons
stopped
in
a
group
without
hurrying
too
much
saniel
went
out
and
in
a
strong
voice
asked
what
had
happened
agent
of
business
has
been
assassinated
in
his
office
word
has
been
sent
to
the
police
bureau
in
the
rue
du
chapter
xiv
the
examination
saniel
was
there
to
observe
without
having
decided
what
he
should
do
instantly
with
the
decision
that
had
him
so
often
during
his
vigil
he
resolved
to
go
to
was
he
not
a
doctor
and
the
physician
of
the
what
could
be
more
natural
he
exclaimed
it
monsieur
caffie
i
am
his
doctor
here
is
a
doctor
cried
several
voices
the
crowd
parted
and
saniel
passed
under
the
where
the
concierge
half
fainting
was
seated
on
a
chair
surrounded
by
all
the
maids
of
the
house
and
several
neighbors
to
whom
she
related
the
news
by
using
his
elbows
he
was
able
to
approach
her
has
said
monsieur
caffie
is
dead
he
asked
with
authority
one
has
said
he
is
dead
at
least
i
have
then
is
a
stain
of
blood
that
has
run
from
his
office
down
to
the
landing
and
as
he
is
at
home
since
the
light
of
his
lamp
is
seen
in
the
court
and
he
never
leaves
it
burning
when
he
goes
to
dinner
something
must
have
happened
and
why
are
his
curtains
drawn
he
always
leaves
them
at
this
moment
two
policemen
appeared
preceded
by
a
locksmith
armed
with
a
bunch
of
keys
and
a
little
man
with
a
shrewd
sharp
appearance
wearing
spectacles
and
a
hat
from
under
which
fell
blond
curls
the
commissioner
of
police
probably
which
story
he
asked
the
concierge
the
with
he
started
to
go
upstairs
accompanied
by
the
concierge
the
locksmith
and
one
of
the
policemen
saniel
wished
to
follow
them
but
the
other
policeman
barred
the
way
monsieur
commissioner
saniel
said
do
you
wish
sir
am
monsieur
name
the
doctor
pass
the
commissioner
said
alone
make
every
one
go
out
and
shut
the
on
reaching
the
landing
the
commissioner
stopped
to
look
at
the
brown
stain
which
running
under
the
door
spread
over
the
tiling
as
caffie
never
had
had
a
mat
is
certainly
a
stain
of
blood
saniel
said
who
stopped
to
examine
it
and
dipped
his
finger
in
it
the
door
the
commissioner
said
to
the
locksmith
the
latter
examined
the
lock
looked
among
his
keys
selected
one
and
unlocked
the
door
no
one
enter
the
commissioner
said
have
the
goodness
to
follow
and
going
ahead
he
entered
the
first
office
that
of
the
clerk
followed
by
saniel
two
little
rills
of
blood
already
thickened
starting
from
chair
and
running
across
the
tiled
floor
which
sloped
a
little
toward
the
side
of
the
staircase
joined
in
the
stain
which
caused
the
discovery
of
the
crime
the
commissioner
and
saniel
took
care
not
to
step
in
it
unfortunate
man
has
had
his
throat
cut
saniel
said
must
have
occurred
two
or
three
hours
ago
there
is
nothing
to
for
yourself
and
stooping
he
picked
up
the
knife
it
not
a
knife
asked
saniel
who
could
only
use
this
word
looks
like
he
had
raised
head
and
examined
the
wound
see
he
said
the
victim
has
been
butchered
the
stroke
was
from
left
to
right
by
a
firm
hand
which
must
be
accustomed
to
handle
this
knife
but
it
is
not
only
a
strong
and
practised
hand
that
has
done
this
deed
it
was
guided
by
an
intelligence
that
knew
how
to
proceed
to
insure
a
quick
almost
instantaneous
death
and
at
the
same
time
a
silent
think
it
was
done
by
a
butcher
a
professional
killer
the
larynx
has
been
cut
above
the
glottis
and
with
the
same
stroke
the
two
carotid
arteries
with
the
jugular
veins
as
the
assassin
had
to
raise
the
head
the
victim
was
not
able
to
cry
out
considerable
blood
has
flowed
and
death
must
have
ensued
in
one
or
two
scene
appears
to
me
very
well
blood
should
have
burst
out
in
this
direction
saniel
continued
pointing
to
the
door
as
this
door
was
open
nothing
is
to
be
while
saniel
spoke
the
commissioner
threw
a
glance
about
the
room
the
glance
of
the
police
which
takes
in
everything
safe
is
open
he
said
affair
becomes
clear
the
assassination
was
followed
by
there
was
a
door
opposite
to
the
entrance
which
the
commissioner
opened
it
was
that
of
bedroom
will
give
you
a
man
to
help
you
carry
the
body
into
this
room
where
you
can
continue
your
examination
more
easily
while
i
will
continue
my
investigations
in
this
saniel
would
have
liked
to
remain
in
the
office
to
assist
at
these
investigations
but
it
was
impossible
to
raise
an
objection
the
chair
was
rolled
into
the
bedroom
where
two
candles
had
been
lighted
on
the
mantel
and
when
the
body
was
laid
on
the
bed
the
commissioner
returned
to
the
office
saniel
made
his
examination
last
as
long
a
time
as
possible
to
the
end
that
he
need
not
leave
the
house
but
he
could
not
prolong
it
beyond
certain
limits
when
they
were
reached
he
returned
to
the
office
where
the
commissioner
had
installed
himself
and
was
hearing
the
deposition
so
he
said
five
to
seven
no
one
asked
for
caffie
one
but
i
left
my
lodge
at
a
quarter
past
five
to
light
the
gas
on
the
stairs
that
took
me
twenty
minutes
because
i
am
stiff
in
my
joints
and
during
this
time
some
one
might
have
gone
up
and
down
the
stairs
without
my
seeing
the
commissioner
said
turning
to
saniel
you
found
any
distinguishing
feature
there
is
only
the
wound
on
the
you
draw
up
your
report
while
i
continue
my
inquest
and
without
waiting
he
seated
himself
at
the
desk
facing
the
secretary
who
had
arrived
a
few
minutes
previous
am
going
to
make
you
take
the
oath
the
commissioner
said
after
this
formality
saniel
began
his
report
the
undersigned
victor
saniel
doctor
of
medicine
of
the
paris
faculty
residing
in
paris
in
the
rue
after
having
taken
an
oath
to
fulfil
in
all
honor
and
conscience
the
mission
confided
to
us
all
the
time
that
he
was
writing
he
paid
attention
to
everything
that
was
said
and
did
not
lose
one
word
of
the
deposition
am
certain
she
said
from
five
until
now
no
one
has
gone
up
or
down
the
stairs
but
the
people
who
live
in
the
before
five
have
told
you
that
from
a
quarter
past
five
until
i
was
not
in
my
before
a
quarter
past
five
persons
passed
whom
i
did
not
any
one
among
them
ask
you
for
monsieur
caffie
that
is
to
say
yes
there
was
one
who
asked
me
if
monsieur
caffie
was
at
home
but
i
know
him
well
that
is
why
i
answered
who
is
he
of
monsieur
caffies
old
name
florentin
monsieur
florentin
hand
was
arrested
at
this
name
but
he
did
not
raise
his
head
what
hour
did
he
come
asked
the
commissioner
three
before
rather
than
you
see
him
go
away
he
spoke
to
time
was
it
you
think
that
death
could
have
occurred
at
this
moment
the
commissioner
asked
turning
to
saniel
i
think
it
must
have
been
between
five
and
six
is
wrong
for
the
commissioner
to
suspect
monsieur
florentin
cried
the
concierge
is
a
good
young
man
incapable
of
harming
a
fly
and
then
there
is
a
good
reason
why
death
could
not
have
taken
place
between
three
and
it
is
that
monsieur
lamp
was
lighted
and
you
know
the
poor
gentleman
was
not
a
man
to
light
his
lamp
in
broad
daylight
looking
as
he
was
she
stopped
abruptly
striking
her
forehead
with
her
hand
is
what
i
remember
and
you
will
see
that
monsieur
florentin
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
affair
as
i
went
upstairs
at
a
quarter
past
five
to
light
my
gas
some
one
came
behind
me
and
rang
monsieur
bell
and
rapped
three
or
four
times
at
equal
distances
which
is
the
signal
to
open
the
again
pen
stopped
and
he
was
obliged
to
lean
his
hand
on
the
table
to
prevent
its
trembling
was
it
that
i
do
not
know
she
answered
did
not
see
him
but
i
heard
him
the
step
of
a
man
it
was
this
rascal
who
killed
him
you
may
be
this
seemed
likely
went
out
while
i
was
on
the
stairs
he
knew
the
customs
of
the
saniel
continued
his
report
after
having
questioned
and
the
concierge
without
being
able
to
make
her
say
more
the
commissioner
dismissed
her
and
leaving
saniel
at
his
work
he
passed
into
office
where
he
remained
a
long
time
when
he
returned
he
brought
a
small
that
he
consulted
without
doubt
it
was
the
book
of
safe
simple
and
primitive
like
everything
relating
to
the
old
habits
governed
by
the
narrowest
economy
in
his
expenses
as
well
as
in
his
work
to
this
the
commissioner
said
to
his
secretary
or
thousand
francs
must
have
been
taken
from
the
safe
but
there
are
left
deeds
and
papers
for
a
large
saniel
who
had
finished
his
report
did
not
take
his
eyes
from
the
and
what
he
could
see
reassured
him
evidently
these
accounts
were
reduced
to
a
minimum
a
date
a
name
a
sum
and
after
this
name
a
capital
p
which
without
doubt
meant
it
was
hardly
possible
that
with
such
a
system
caffie
had
ever
taken
the
trouble
to
enter
the
number
of
the
bills
that
had
passed
through
his
hands
in
any
case
if
he
did
it
was
not
in
this
would
another
one
be
found
report
is
finished
he
said
it
you
are
here
perhaps
you
can
give
me
some
information
concerning
the
habits
of
the
victim
and
the
persons
he
at
all
i
have
known
him
but
a
short
time
and
he
was
my
patient
as
i
was
his
client
by
accident
he
undertook
an
affair
for
me
and
i
gave
him
advice
he
was
in
the
last
stage
of
diabetes
the
assassin
hastened
his
death
only
a
short
few
is
nothing
he
hastened
certainly
otherwise
if
he
is
skilful
in
cutting
throats
perhaps
he
is
less
so
in
making
a
diagnosis
of
their
is
probable
responded
the
commissioner
smiling
think
it
was
a
butcher
seems
knife
might
have
stolen
it
or
found
the
mode
of
operating
it
seems
to
me
is
the
point
from
where
we
should
saniel
could
remain
no
longer
and
he
rose
to
leave
have
my
address
he
said
i
must
tell
you
if
you
want
me
i
leave
for
nice
but
i
shall
be
absent
only
just
long
enough
to
go
and
we
want
you
it
will
not
be
for
several
days
we
shall
not
get
on
very
rapidly
we
have
so
little
to
guide
chapter
xv
a
new
plan
saniel
walked
home
briskly
if
more
than
once
during
this
interview
his
emotion
was
poignant
he
could
not
but
be
satisfied
with
the
result
the
concierge
had
not
seen
him
that
was
henceforth
unquestionable
the
hypothesis
of
the
knife
was
put
in
a
way
to
make
his
fortune
and
it
seemed
probable
that
caffie
had
not
kept
the
numbers
of
the
but
if
they
had
been
noted
and
should
the
notebook
containing
them
be
discovered
later
the
danger
was
not
immediate
while
writing
his
report
and
listening
to
the
deposition
by
a
sort
of
inspiration
he
thought
of
a
way
of
disposing
of
them
he
would
divide
them
into
small
packages
place
them
in
envelopes
and
address
them
with
different
initials
to
the
poste
restante
where
they
would
remain
until
he
could
call
for
them
without
compromising
himself
in
the
deposition
of
the
concierge
in
the
track
indicated
by
the
knife
in
the
poste
restante
he
had
just
motives
for
satisfaction
that
made
him
breathe
freely
decidedly
fate
seemed
to
be
with
him
and
he
should
have
been
able
to
say
that
everything
was
going
well
if
he
had
not
committed
the
imprudence
of
entering
the
cafe
why
had
he
gone
there
and
remained
long
enough
to
attract
attention
what
might
not
be
the
consequences
of
this
stupidity
as
soon
as
he
reached
home
and
his
door
was
closed
he
carried
out
his
intentions
regarding
the
dividing
them
into
ten
packages
his
first
thought
was
to
place
them
in
the
nearest
letterbox
but
reflection
showed
him
that
this
would
be
unwise
and
he
decided
to
mail
each
one
in
a
different
quarter
of
the
city
after
his
long
walk
of
the
morning
and
the
emotions
of
the
evening
he
felt
a
fatigue
that
he
had
never
known
before
but
he
comprehended
that
he
was
not
at
liberty
to
yield
to
this
weariness
a
new
situation
was
made
for
him
and
henceforth
he
no
longer
belonged
to
himself
for
the
rest
of
his
life
he
would
be
the
prisoner
of
his
crime
and
it
was
this
crime
which
from
this
evening
would
command
and
he
must
obey
why
had
he
not
foreseen
this
situation
when
weighing
the
pro
and
con
like
an
intelligent
man
who
can
scrutinize
the
future
under
all
its
phases
he
had
examined
what
must
happen
but
surprising
as
it
was
the
discovery
was
no
less
certain
and
the
sad
and
troublesome
proof
was
that
however
intelligent
one
may
be
one
can
always
learn
by
experience
what
was
there
yet
to
learn
he
confessed
that
he
found
himself
face
to
face
with
the
unknown
and
all
that
he
wished
was
that
this
lesson
he
had
learned
from
experience
might
be
the
hardest
it
would
be
folly
to
imagine
that
it
was
the
last
time
would
show
when
he
returned
home
after
posting
his
letters
it
was
long
past
one
he
went
to
bed
immediately
and
slept
heavily
without
waking
or
dreaming
it
was
broad
daylight
when
he
opened
his
eyes
the
next
morning
surprised
at
having
slept
so
late
he
jumped
up
and
looked
at
his
watch
which
said
eight
but
as
he
should
not
leave
until
a
quarter
past
eleven
he
had
plenty
of
time
how
should
he
employ
it
it
was
the
first
time
in
years
that
he
had
asked
himself
such
a
question
he
who
each
day
always
found
that
he
needed
three
or
four
hours
more
to
carry
out
his
programme
he
dressed
slowly
and
then
thought
of
writing
to
phillis
to
tell
her
of
his
trip
to
nice
but
suddenly
he
changed
his
mind
and
decided
to
go
to
see
her
the
preceding
year
he
attended
madame
cormier
who
had
been
stricken
with
paralysis
and
he
could
occasionally
present
himself
at
her
house
without
appearing
to
call
upon
phillis
it
was
easy
to
say
that
he
was
passing
by
and
wished
to
learn
news
of
the
patient
whom
he
had
cured
at
nine
he
knocked
at
her
door
a
voice
said
he
was
surprised
for
in
his
visits
to
madame
cormier
he
had
never
seen
a
man
there
he
crossed
the
hall
and
knocked
at
the
door
this
time
it
was
phillis
who
bid
him
come
in
he
opened
the
door
and
saw
phillis
in
a
gray
blouse
seated
before
a
large
table
placed
by
the
window
she
was
painting
some
cards
hearing
steps
she
turned
her
head
and
instantly
rose
but
she
restrained
the
name
that
was
on
her
lips
she
said
is
doctor
madame
cormier
entered
walking
with
difficulty
for
if
saniel
had
put
her
on
her
feet
he
had
not
given
her
the
suppleness
or
the
grace
of
youth
after
a
few
words
saniel
explained
that
having
to
pay
a
visit
to
the
batignolles
he
would
not
come
so
near
his
former
patient
without
calling
to
see
her
while
madame
cormier
told
at
great
length
how
she
felt
and
also
how
she
did
not
feel
phillis
looked
at
saniel
uneasy
to
see
his
face
so
convulsed
surely
something
very
serious
had
happened
his
visit
said
this
but
what
her
anguish
was
so
much
the
greater
because
he
certainly
avoided
looking
at
her
why
she
had
done
nothing
and
could
find
nothing
with
which
to
reproach
herself
at
this
moment
the
door
opened
and
a
man
still
young
tall
with
a
curled
beard
entered
the
room
son
madame
cormier
said
brother
florentin
of
whom
we
have
spoken
so
often
phillis
said
florentin
was
he
then
becoming
imbecile
that
he
had
not
thought
the
voice
of
the
man
who
bid
him
enter
was
that
of
brother
was
he
so
profoundly
overwhelmed
that
such
a
simple
reasoning
was
impossible
to
him
decidedly
it
was
important
for
him
to
go
away
as
quickly
as
possible
the
journey
would
calm
his
nerves
wrote
to
me
florentin
said
since
my
return
they
have
told
me
how
good
you
were
to
my
mother
permit
me
to
thank
you
from
a
touched
and
grateful
heart
i
hope
that
before
long
this
gratitude
will
be
something
more
than
a
vain
not
let
us
speak
of
that
saniel
said
looking
at
phillis
with
a
frankness
and
an
open
countenance
that
reassured
heron
a
certain
point
is
i
who
am
obliged
to
madame
cormier
if
the
word
were
not
barbarous
i
should
say
that
her
illness
has
been
a
good
thing
for
to
turn
the
conversation
and
because
he
wished
to
speak
to
phillis
alone
he
approached
her
table
and
talked
with
her
about
her
work
saniel
then
gave
madame
cormier
some
advice
and
rose
to
go
phillis
followed
him
and
florentin
was
about
to
accompany
them
but
phillis
stopped
him

to
ask

question

said
when
they
were
on
the

closed

asked
in

and

xvi
the
smiles
of
fortune
no
one
knew
so
little
about
play
as
saniel
he
knew
that
people
played
at
monaco
and
that
was
all
he
bought
his
ticket
for
monaco
and
left
the
train
at
that
place
on
leaving
the
station
he
looked
all
about
him
to
see
what
kind
of
a
place
it
was
seeing
nothing
that
looked
like
a
as
he
understood
it
that
is
like
the
casino
de
royal
the
only
establishment
of
the
kind
that
he
had
ever
seen
he
asked
a
is
the
is
none
at
thought
there
is
one
at
monte
it
far
with
his
hand
the
man
indicated
on
the
slope
of
the
mountain
a
green
spot
where
in
the
midst
of
the
foliage
were
seen
roofs
and
facades
of
imposing
buildings
saniel
thanked
him
and
followed
his
directions
while
the
man
calling
another
related
the
question
that
had
been
addressed
to
him
and
both
laughed
shrugging
their
shoulders
could
any
one
be
so
stupid
as
these
parisians
another
one
who
was
going
to
be
plucked
and
who
came
from
paris
expressly
for
that
was
he
not
funny
with
his
big
legs
and
arms
without
troubling
himself
about
the
laughter
that
he
heard
behind
him
saniel
continued
his
way
in
spite
of
his
night
on
the
train
he
felt
no
fatigue
on
the
contrary
his
mind
and
body
were
active
the
journey
had
calmed
the
agitation
of
his
nerves
and
it
was
with
perfect
tranquillity
he
looked
back
upon
all
that
had
passed
before
his
departure
in
the
state
of
satisfaction
that
was
his
now
he
had
nothing
more
to
fear
from
stupidity
or
acts
of
folly
and
since
he
had
recovered
his
will
all
would
go
well
no
more
backward
glances
and
fewer
still
before
the
present
only
should
absorb
him
the
present
at
this
moment
was
play
what
did
they
play
he
knew
roulette
but
he
knew
not
if
the
game
was
roulette
he
would
do
as
others
did
if
he
were
ridiculed
it
was
of
little
importance
and
in
reality
he
should
desire
to
be
ridiculed
people
remember
with
pleasure
those
at
whom
they
have
laughed
and
he
had
come
here
to
find
some
one
who
would
remember
him
when
he
entered
the
salon
where
the
playing
was
going
on
he
observed
that
a
religious
silence
reigned
there
round
a
large
table
covered
with
a
carpet
of
green
cloth
which
was
divided
by
lines
and
figures
some
men
were
seated
on
high
chairs
making
them
appear
like
officers
others
on
lower
chairs
or
simply
standing
about
the
table
pushed
or
picked
up
the
louis
and
bank
bills
on
the
green
cloth
and
a
strong
voice
repeated
in
a
monotonous
tone
faites
votre
jeu
le
jeu
est
fait
rien
ne
va
plus
then
a
little
ivory
ball
was
thrown
into
a
cylinder
where
it
rolled
with
a
metallic
noise
although
he
had
never
seen
roulette
it
required
no
effort
to
divine
that
this
was
the
game
and
before
putting
several
louis
on
the
table
he
looked
about
him
to
see
how
it
was
played
but
after
the
tenth
time
he
understood
as
little
as
at
first
with
the
rakes
the
croupiers
collected
the
stakes
of
certain
players
with
these
same
rakes
they
doubled
separated
or
even
paid
in
proportions
of
which
he
took
no
account
certain
others
and
that
was
all
but
it
mattered
little
having
seen
how
the
money
was
placed
on
the
table
that
was
sufficient
he
had
five
louis
in
his
hand
when
the
croupier
said
faites
votre
he
placed
them
on
the
number
or
at
least
he
believed
that
he
placed
them
on
this
number
ne
va
plus
the
ball
rolled
in
the
cylinder
cried
the
croupier
adding
some
other
words
that
saniel
did
not
understand
so
little
did
he
understand
roulette
that
he
thought
he
had
lost
he
had
placed
his
stake
on
the
and
it
was
the
that
had
appeared
the
bank
had
won
he
was
surprised
to
see
the
croupier
push
a
heap
of
gold
toward
him
which
amounted
to
nearly
a
hundred
louis
and
accompany
this
movement
with
a
glance
which
without
any
doubt
meant
to
say
you
what
should
he
do
since
he
had
lost
he
could
not
take
this
money
that
was
given
to
him
by
mistake
in
placing
his
stake
on
the
table
he
had
leaned
over
the
shoulder
of
a
gentleman
whose
hair
and
beard
were
of
a
most
extraordinary
black
who
without
playing
pricked
a
card
with
a
pin
this
gentleman
turned
toward
him
and
with
an
amiable
smile
and
in
a
most
gracious
tone
said
is
yours
decidedly
he
was
mistaken
in
thinking
he
had
lost
and
he
must
take
this
heap
of
louis
which
he
did
but
neglecting
to
take
also
his
first
stake
the
game
continued
called
the
croupier
saniel
perceived
that
his
five
louis
had
remained
on
the
he
believed
that
he
had
won
since
this
number
was
called
and
his
ignorance
was
such
that
he
did
not
know
that
in
roulette
a
number
is
paid
times
the
stake
the
croupier
would
therefore
push
toward
him
one
hundred
and
eighty
louis
but
to
his
great
surprise
he
pushed
him
no
more
money
than
at
first
this
was
incomprehensible
when
he
lost
money
was
paid
to
him
and
when
he
won
he
was
paid
only
half
his
due
his
face
betrayed
his
astonishment
so
plainly
that
he
saw
a
mocking
smile
in
the
eyes
of
the
man
who
had
again
turned
toward
him
as
he
played
merely
for
the
sake
of
playing
and
not
to
win
or
lose
he
pocketed
all
that
was
pushed
toward
him
and
his
stake
you
are
not
going
to
play
any
more
said
the
amiable
gentleman
leaving
his
chair
you
permit
me
to
say
a
word
to
you
saniel
bowed
and
together
they
left
the
table
when
they
were
far
enough
away
to
converse
without
disturbing
the
players
the
gentleman
bowed
ceremoniously
me
to
present
saniel
replied
by
giving
his
name
and
position
doctor
the
prince
said
with
a
strong
italian
accent
will
pardon
me
i
hope
for
making
the
simple
observation
that
my
age
authorizes
you
play
like
a
an
ignoramus
saniel
replied
without
being
angry
for
however
unusual
this
observation
might
be
he
had
already
decided
that
it
might
be
a
good
thing
in
the
future
to
call
upon
the
testimony
of
a
prince
am
sure
you
are
still
asking
yourself
why
you
received
eighteen
times
the
sum
of
your
stake
at
the
first
play
and
why
you
did
not
receive
times
the
sum
at
the
is
i
will
tell
and
he
proceeded
to
explain
saniel
did
not
wait
for
the
conclusion
to
learn
the
fact
that
this
italian
prince
was
a
liar
do
not
intend
to
play
again
he
said
your
luck
that
would
be
more
than
a
wanted
a
certain
sum
i
have
won
it
and
that
satisfies
will
not
be
so
foolish
as
to
refuse
the
hand
that
fortune
holds
out
you
sure
she
holds
it
out
to
me
saniel
asked
finding
that
it
was
the
prince
not
doubt
it
i
will
show
you
you
but
i
never
break
a
in
another
moment
saniel
would
have
turned
his
back
on
the
man
but
he
was
a
witness
whom
it
would
be
well
to
treat
with
caution
have
nothing
more
to
do
here
he
said
politely
me
to
retire
after
having
thanked
you
for
your
offer
whose
kindness
i
cried
the
prince
you
will
not
risk
your
fate
let
me
do
it
for
you
this
money
may
be
a
fetich
take
off
five
louis
only
five
louis
and
confide
them
to
me
i
will
play
them
according
to
my
combinations
which
are
certain
and
this
evening
i
will
give
you
your
part
of
the
proceeds
where
are
you
staying
i
live
at
the
villa
des
i
have
just
let
us
meet
here
this
evening
at
ten
in
this
room
and
we
will
liquidate
our
his
first
impulse
was
to
refuse
of
what
use
to
give
alms
to
this
old
monkey
but
after
all
it
did
not
cost
much
to
pay
his
witness
five
louis
and
he
gave
them
to
him
thousand
thanks
this
evening
at
ten
as
saniel
left
the
room
he
found
himself
face
to
face
with
his
old
comrade
duphot
who
was
accompanied
by
a
woman
the
same
whom
he
had
cured
you
here
both
the
lover
and
his
mistress
exclaimed
saniel
related
why
he
was
at
monaco
and
what
he
had
done
since
his
arrival
my
money
ah
she
is
very
well
duphot
cried
you
will
play
no
more
the
woman
asked
have
all
i
you
will
play
for
he
wished
to
decline
but
they
drew
him
to
the
roulette
table
and
each
put
a
louis
in
his
hand
inspiration
counsels
you
you
have
the
but
his
luck
had
died
the
two
louis
were
lost
they
gave
him
two
others
which
won
eight
see
dear
he
went
on
with
varying
luck
winning
and
losing
at
the
end
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
they
permitted
him
to
go
what
are
you
going
to
do
now
duphot
asked
send
what
i
owe
to
my
creditors
by
you
know
where
the
telegraph
is
will
go
with
this
was
a
second
witness
that
saniel
was
too
wise
to
shake
off
when
he
had
sent
his
telegram
to
jardine
he
had
nothing
more
to
do
at
monte
carlo
and
as
he
could
not
leave
before
eleven
in
the
evening
he
was
idle
not
knowing
how
to
employ
his
time
so
he
bought
a
nice
newspaper
and
seated
himself
in
the
garden
under
a
gaslight
facing
the
dark
and
tranquil
sea
perhaps
he
could
find
in
it
some
telegraph
despatch
which
would
tell
him
what
had
occurred
in
the
rue
since
his
departure
at
the
end
of
the
paper
under
news
he
read
crime
of
the
rue
seems
to
take
a
new
turn
the
investigations
made
with
more
care
have
led
to
the
discovery
of
a
button
to
which
is
attached
a
piece
of
cloth
it
shows
therefore
that
before
the
crime
there
was
a
struggle
between
the
victim
and
the
assassin
as
this
button
has
certain
letters
and
marks
it
is
a
valuable
clew
for
the
this
proof
of
a
struggle
between
the
victim
and
the
assassin
made
saniel
smile
who
could
tell
how
long
this
button
had
been
there
suddenly
he
left
his
seat
and
entering
a
copse
he
examined
his
clothing
was
it
he
who
had
lost
it
but
soon
he
was
ashamed
of
this
unconscious
movement
the
button
which
the
police
were
so
proud
to
discover
did
not
belong
to
him
this
new
track
on
which
they
were
about
to
enter
did
not
lead
to
him
chapter
xvii
fears
on
tuesday
a
little
before
five
as
she
had
promised
phillis
rang
at
door
and
he
left
his
laboratory
where
he
was
at
work
to
let
her
in
she
threw
herself
on
his
neck
she
asked
in
a
trembling
voice
he
told
her
how
he
had
played
and
won
without
stating
the
exact
sum
also
the
propositions
of
the
prince
mazzazoli
the
meeting
with
duphot
and
the
telegram
to
jardine
what
happiness
she
said
pressing
him
in
her
arms
are
free
more
creditors
i
am
my
own
master
you
see
it
was
a
good
inspiration
justice
willed
then
interrupting
him
of
justice
you
did
not
speak
of
caffie
the
morning
of
your
was
so
preoccupied
i
had
no
time
to
think
of
it
not
curious
the
coincidence
of
his
death
with
the
condemnation
that
we
pronounced
against
him
does
it
not
prove
exactly
the
justice
of
things
you
the
money
you
won
at
monaco
proves
to
you
that
what
is
just
will
happen
caffie
is
punished
for
all
his
rascalities
and
crimes
and
you
are
rewarded
for
your
it
not
have
been
just
if
caffie
had
been
punished
sooner
and
if
i
had
suffered
less
she
remained
silent
see
he
said
smiling
your
philosophy
is
is
not
of
my
philosophy
that
i
am
thinking
but
of
caffie
and
how
can
caffie
be
associated
with
you
or
yours
is
or
rather
he
may
be
if
this
justice
in
which
i
believe
in
spite
of
your
joking
permits
him
to
are
talking
in
have
you
heard
about
caffie
since
you
went
away
or
almost
know
it
is
thought
that
the
crime
was
committed
by
a
commissioner
picked
up
the
knife
before
me
and
it
is
certainly
a
knife
and
more
than
that
the
stroke
that
cut
throat
was
given
by
a
hand
accustomed
to
butchery
i
have
indicated
this
in
my
then
more
careful
investigations
have
discovered
a
button
might
have
been
torn
off
in
a
struggle
between
caffie
and
his
assassin
i
read
in
a
newspaper
but
as
for
me
i
do
not
believe
in
this
struggle
position
in
his
chair
where
he
was
assaulted
and
where
he
died
indicates
that
the
old
scamp
was
surprised
otherwise
if
he
had
not
been
if
he
had
struggled
he
could
have
cried
out
and
without
doubt
he
would
have
been
you
knew
how
happy
i
am
to
hear
you
say
that
she
cried
what
difference
can
it
make
to
you
and
he
looked
at
her
in
surprise
what
importance
is
it
to
you
whether
caffie
was
killed
with
or
without
a
struggle
you
condemned
him
he
is
dead
that
should
satisfy
was
very
wrong
to
pronounce
this
condemnation
which
i
did
without
attaching
any
importance
to
you
think
that
hastened
its
execution
am
not
so
foolish
as
that
but
i
should
be
better
pleased
if
i
had
not
condemned
you
regret
it
regret
that
he
is
the
enigma
continues
but
you
know
i
do
not
understand
it
and
if
you
wish
we
will
stop
there
we
have
something
better
to
do
than
to
talk
of
the
contrary
let
me
talk
to
you
of
him
because
we
want
your
again
he
looked
at
her
trying
to
read
her
face
and
to
divine
why
she
insisted
on
speaking
of
caffie
when
he
had
just
expressed
a
wish
not
to
speak
of
him
what
was
there
beneath
this
insistence
will
listen
he
said
since
you
wish
to
ask
my
advice
on
the
subject
you
must
tell
me
immediately
what
you
are
right
and
i
should
have
told
you
before
but
embarrassment
and
shame
restrained
me
and
i
reproach
myself
for
with
you
i
should
feel
neither
embarrassment
nor
before
everything
else
i
must
tell
you
you
must
know
that
my
brother
florentin
is
a
good
and
honest
boy
you
must
believe
it
you
must
be
convinced
of
am
since
you
tell
me
so
besides
he
produced
the
best
impression
on
me
during
the
short
time
i
saw
him
the
other
day
at
your
not
one
see
immediately
that
he
has
a
good
nature
and
upright
weak
it
is
true
and
a
little
effeminate
also
that
is
lacking
energy
letting
himself
be
carried
away
by
goodness
and
tenderness
this
weakness
made
him
commit
a
fault
before
his
departure
for
america
i
have
kept
it
from
you
until
this
moment
but
you
must
know
it
now
loving
a
woman
who
controlled
him
and
made
him
do
what
she
wished
he
let
himself
be
persuaded
a
sum
of
francs
that
she
demanded
that
she
insisted
on
having
that
evening
hoping
to
be
able
to
replace
it
three
days
later
without
his
employer
discovering
employer
was
caffie
it
was
three
months
after
he
left
caffie
and
he
was
with
another
man
of
business
of
whom
i
have
never
spoken
to
you
and
now
you
understand
why
the
money
he
expected
failed
him
his
fault
was
discovered
and
his
employer
lodged
a
complaint
against
made
him
withdraw
his
complaint
never
mind
how
and
florentin
went
to
america
to
seek
his
fortune
and
since
you
have
seen
him
you
admit
that
he
might
be
capable
of
the
fault
that
he
committed
without
being
becoming
an
he
was
about
to
reply
but
she
closed
his
lips
with
a
quick
gesture
will
see
why
i
speak
of
this
and
you
will
understand
why
i
do
not
drop
the
subject
of
caffie
and
of
this
button
on
which
the
police
count
to
find
the
criminal
this
button
belonged
to
your
brother
to
florentin
who
the
day
of
the
crime
had
been
to
see
is
true
the
concierge
told
the
commissioner
of
police
that
he
called
about
three
phillis
gave
a
cry
of
despair
know
he
was
there
then
it
is
more
serious
than
we
imagined
or
answering
a
question
as
to
whom
caffie
had
received
that
day
the
concierge
named
your
brother
but
as
this
visit
took
place
between
three
and
and
the
crime
was
certainly
committed
between
five
and
no
one
can
accuse
your
brother
of
being
the
assassin
since
he
left
before
caffie
lighted
his
lamp
as
this
lamp
could
not
light
itself
it
proves
that
he
could
not
have
butchered
a
man
who
was
living
an
hour
after
the
concierge
saw
your
brother
and
talked
with
you
say
is
a
great
relief
if
you
could
know
how
alarmed
we
have
been
were
too
hasty
to
alarm
hasty
but
when
florentin
read
the
account
to
us
and
came
to
the
button
he
exclaimed
button
is
mine
and
we
experienced
a
shock
that
made
us
lose
our
heads
we
saw
the
police
falling
on
us
questioning
florentin
reproaching
him
with
the
past
which
would
be
retailed
in
all
the
newspapers
and
you
must
understand
how
we
can
not
your
brother
explain
how
he
lost
this
button
at
and
in
the
most
natural
way
he
went
to
see
caffie
to
ask
him
for
a
letter
of
recommendation
saying
that
he
had
been
his
clerk
for
several
years
caffie
gave
it
to
him
and
then
in
the
course
of
conversation
caffie
spoke
of
a
bundle
of
papers
that
he
could
not
find
florentin
had
had
charge
of
these
papers
and
had
placed
them
on
a
high
shelf
in
the
closet
as
caffie
could
not
find
them
and
wanted
them
florentin
brought
a
small
ladder
and
mounting
it
found
them
he
was
about
to
descend
the
ladder
when
he
made
a
misstep
and
in
trying
to
save
himself
one
of
the
buttons
of
his
trousers
was
pulled
he
did
not
pick
it
up
did
not
even
notice
it
at
first
but
later
in
the
street
seeing
one
leg
of
his
trousers
longer
than
the
other
he
thought
of
the
ladder
and
found
that
he
had
lost
a
button
he
would
not
return
to
to
look
for
it
of
could
he
foresee
that
caffie
would
be
assassinated
that
the
crime
would
be
so
skilfully
planned
and
executed
that
the
criminal
would
escape
that
two
days
later
the
police
would
find
a
button
on
which
they
would
build
a
story
that
would
make
him
the
criminal
florentin
had
not
thought
of
all
is
same
evening
he
replaced
the
button
by
another
and
it
was
only
on
reading
the
newspaper
that
he
felt
there
might
be
something
serious
in
this
apparently
insignificant
fact
and
we
shared
his
you
spoken
to
any
one
of
this
button
not
we
know
too
much
i
tell
you
of
it
because
i
tell
you
everything
and
if
we
are
menaced
we
have
no
help
to
expect
except
from
you
florentin
is
a
good
boy
but
he
is
weak
and
foolish
mamma
is
like
him
in
more
than
one
respect
and
as
for
me
although
i
am
more
resistant
i
confess
that
in
the
face
of
the
law
and
the
police
i
should
easily
lose
my
head
like
children
who
begin
to
scream
when
they
are
left
in
the
dark
is
not
the
law
when
you
know
nothing
of
it
a
night
of
trouble
full
of
horrors
and
peopled
with
phantoms
do
not
believe
there
is
the
danger
that
you
imagined
in
the
first
moment
of
was
natural
i
admit
but
reflection
must
show
how
little
foundation
there
is
for
it
the
button
has
not
the
name
of
the
tailor
who
furnished
it
but
it
has
the
initials
and
the
mark
of
the
manufacturer
an
a
and
a
p
with
a
crown
and
a
among
two
or
three
thousand
tailors
in
paris
how
is
it
possible
for
the
police
to
find
those
who
use
these
buttons
and
when
the
tailors
are
found
how
could
they
designate
the
owner
of
this
button
this
one
exactly
and
not
another
it
is
looking
for
a
needle
in
a
bundle
of
hay
where
did
your
brother
have
these
trousers
made
did
he
bring
them
from
america
poor
boy
brought
nothing
from
america
but
wretchedly
shabby
clothes
and
we
had
to
clothe
him
from
head
to
foot
we
were
obliged
to
economize
and
a
little
tailor
in
the
avenue
de
clichy
called
valerius
made
this
seems
to
me
scarcely
probable
that
the
police
will
find
this
little
tailor
but
if
they
do
would
he
recognize
the
button
as
coming
from
his
stock
and
if
they
get
as
far
as
your
brother
they
must
prove
that
there
was
a
struggle
that
the
button
was
torn
off
in
this
struggle
that
your
brother
was
in
the
rue
between
five
and
six
in
which
case
without
doubt
he
will
find
it
easy
to
prove
where
he
was
at
that
was
with
us
with
see
then
you
need
not
feel

the
confidence

saniel
caused

to

past
when
in
this
quiet
house
where
all
the
lodgers
knew
each
other
the
key
was
left
in
the
door
and
one
had
only
to
knock
before
entering
since
the
newspapers
had
spoken
of
the
button
all
was
changed
the
feeling
of
liberty
and
security
had
disappeared
the
door
was
always
closed
and
when
the
bell
rang
they
looked
at
each
other
in
fear
and
with
trembling
when
florentin
opened
the
door
the
table
was
set
for
dinner
was
afraid
something
had
happened
to
you
madame
cormier
said
was
she
took
off
her
hat
and
cloak
hastily
have
learned
nothing
the
mother
asked
bringing
in
the
soup
spoke
to
you
of
nothing
florentin
continued
in
a
low
voice
spoke
to
me
of
nothing
else
or
i
heard
only
that
when
i
was
not
addressed
was
said
one
believes
that
the
investigations
of
the
police
bear
on
the
see
florentin
madame
cormier
interrupted
smiling
at
her
son
but
he
shook
his
head
the
opinion
of
all
has
a
value
phillis
cried
lower
florentin
said
is
thought
that
it
is
impossible
for
the
police
to
find
among
the
two
or
three
thousand
tailors
in
paris
all
those
who
use
the
buttons
marked
and
if
they
did
find
them
they
could
not
designate
all
their
customers
to
whom
they
have
furnished
these
buttons
it
is
really
looking
for
a
needle
in
a
bundle
of
one
takes
plenty
of
time
one
finds
a
needle
in
a
bundle
of
hay
florentin
said
ask
me
what
i
heard
and
i
tell
you
but
i
do
not
depend
entirely
on
that
as
i
passed
near
the
rue
i
went
to
doctor
it
being
his
office
hour
i
hoped
to
find
told
him
the
situation
florentin
exclaimed
in
any
other
circumstances
she
would
have
replied
frankly
explaining
that
she
had
perfect
confidence
in
saniel
but
when
she
saw
her
agitation
she
could
not
exasperate
him
by
this
avowal
above
all
because
she
could
not
at
the
same
time
give
her
reasons
for
her
faith
in
him
she
must
reassure
him
before
everything
she
said
i
spoke
of
caffie
to
doctor
saniel
without
his
being
surprised
as
he
made
the
first
deposition
was
it
not
natural
that
my
curiosity
should
wish
to
learn
a
little
more
than
the
newspapers
tell
mind
the
act
must
appear
think
not
but
anyhow
the
interest
that
we
have
to
learn
all
made
me
overlook
this
and
i
think
when
i
have
told
you
the
opinion
you
will
not
regret
my
this
opinion
madame
cormier
asked
opinion
is
that
there
was
no
struggle
between
caffie
and
the
assassin
whereas
the
position
of
caffie
in
the
chair
where
he
was
attacked
proves
that
he
was
surprised
therefore
if
there
was
no
struggle
there
was
no
button
torn
off
and
all
the
scaffolding
of
the
police
falls
to
the
madame
cormier
breathed
a
profound
sigh
of
deliverance
see
she
said
to
her
son
the
opinion
is
not
the
opinion
of
the
it
is
not
even
that
of
an
ordinary
physician
it
is
that
of
the
physician
who
has
certified
to
the
death
and
who
more
than
any
one
has
power
has
authority
to
say
how
it
was
given
by
surprise
without
struggle
without
a
button
being
pulled
is
not
doctor
saniel
who
directs
the
search
of
the
police
or
who
inspires
it
replied
florentin
opinion
does
not
produce
a
criminal
while
the
button
can
at
least
for
those
who
believe
in
the
struggle
and
between
the
two
the
police
will
not
hesitate
the
newspapers
laugh
at
them
for
not
having
discovered
the
assassin
who
has
rejoined
all
the
others
they
have
let
escape
they
must
follow
the
track
they
have
started
on
and
this
track
he
lowered
his
voice
will
lead
them
do
that
they
must
pass
by
the
avenue
de
clichy
and
that
seems
is
the
possible
that
torments
me
and
not
the
unlikely
and
you
can
not
but
recognize
that
what
i
fear
is
possible
i
was
at
caffies
the
day
of
the
crime
i
lost
there
a
button
torn
off
by
violence
this
button
picked
up
by
the
police
proves
according
to
them
the
criminality
of
the
one
who
lost
it
they
will
find
that
i
am
the
one
will
not
find
us
admit
that
they
do
find
me
how
should
i
defend
myself
proving
that
you
were
not
in
the
rue
between
five
and
six
since
you
were
what
witnesses
will
prove
this
alibi
i
have
only
one
mamma
what
is
the
testimony
of
a
mother
worth
in
favor
of
her
son
in
such
circumstances
will
have
that
of
the
doctor
affirming
that
there
was
no
struggle
and
consequently
no
button
torn
but
carrying
no
proof
to
support
his
theory
the
opinion
of
one
doctor
which
the
opinion
of
another
doctor
may
refute
and
destroy
and
then
to
prove
that
there
was
no
struggle
doctor
saniel
will
say
that
caffie
was
surprised
who
could
surprise
caffie
to
open
caffies
door
when
the
clerk
was
away
it
was
necessary
to
ring
first
and
then
to
knock
three
times
in
a
peculiar
way
no
stranger
could
know
that
and
who
could
know
it
better
than
i
step
by
step
phillis
defended
the
ground
against
her
brother
but
little
by
little
the
confidence
which
at
first
sustained
her
weakened
with
saniel
she
was
brave
between
her
brother
and
mother
in
this
room
that
had
witnessed
their
fears
not
daring
to
speak
loud
she
was
downcast
and
let
herself
be
overcome
by
their
anxieties
she
said
seems
as
if
we
were
guilty
and
not
while
we
are
tormenting
ourselves
the
criminal
probably
in
perfect
safety
laughs
at
the
police
investigations
he
had
not
thought
of
this
button
chance
throws
it
in
his
way
luck
is
for
him
and
against
us
once
this
was
the
plaint
that
was
often
on
lips
although
he
had
never
been
a
gambler
and
for
sufficient
reason
in
his
eyes
everything
was
decided
by
luck
there
are
those
who
are
born
under
a
lucky
star
others
under
an
unlucky
one
there
are
those
who
in
the
battle
of
life
receive
knocks
without
being
discouraged
because
they
expect
something
the
next
day
as
there
are
those
who
become
discouraged
because
they
expect
nothing
and
know
by
experience
that
tomorrow
will
be
for
them
what
today
is
what
yesterday
was
and
florentin
was
one
of
these
did
i
not
stay
in
america
he
said
you
were
too
unhappy
my
poor
boy
madame
cormier
said
whose
maternal
heart
was
moved
by
this
cry
i
happier
here
or
shall
i
be
what
does
this
full
of
uncertainty
and
dangers
hold
for
us
do
you
insist
that
it
has
only
dangers
phillis
asked
in
a
conciliating
and
caressing
tone
always
expect
the
least
i
hope
for
it
and
do
not
admit
deliberately
that
it
is
impossible
i
do
not
say
that
life
is
always
but
neither
is
it
always
black
i
believe
it
is
like
the
seasons
after
winter
which
is
vile
i
confess
come
the
spring
summer
and
if
i
had
the
money
necessary
for
the
voyage
i
would
go
and
pass
the
end
of
the
winter
in
a
country
where
it
would
be
less
disagreeable
than
here
and
above
all
less
dangerous
for
my
do
not
say
that
seriously
i
hope
cried
madame
cormier
the
contrary
very
are
hardly
reunited
and
you
think
of
a
separation
she
said
sadly
is
not
of
a
separation
that
florentin
thinks
cried
phillis
of
a
why
not
only
the
guilty
is
exactly
the
contrary
the
intelligent
criminals
stay
and
as
generally
they
are
resolute
men
they
know
beforehand
that
they
are
able
to
face
the
danger
while
the
innocent
timid
like
myself
or
the
unlucky
lose
their
heads
and
fly
because
they
know
beforehand
also
that
if
a
danger
threatens
them
it
will
crush
them
that
is
why
i
would
return
to
america
if
i
could
pay
my
passage
at
least
i
should
feel
easy
there
was
a
moment
of
silence
during
which
each
one
seemed
to
have
no
thought
but
to
finish
dinner
that
this
project
is
not
likely
florentin
said
have
another
do
you
have
ideas
phillis
asked
wish
you
were
in
my
place
we
should
see
if
you
would
not
have
assure
you
that
i
am
in
your
place
and
that
your
trouble
is
mine
only
it
does
not
betray
itself
in
the
same
manner
but
what
is
your
idea
is
to
find
valerius
and
tell
him
who
will
answer
to
us
for
discretion
asked
madame
cormier
it
not
be
the
greatest
imprudence
that
you
could
commit
one
can
not
play
with
a
secret
of
this
is
an
honest
is
because
he
can
not
work
when
political
or
rather
patriotic
affairs
go
wrong
that
you
say
why
not
with
a
poor
man
who
lives
in
a
small
way
by
his
work
are
not
this
care
and
pride
in
his
country
marks
of
an
honorable
heart
grant
the
honorable
heart
but
it
is
another
reason
for
being
prudent
with
him
phillis
said
because
he
may
be
what
you
think
reserve
is
necessary
you
tell
him
what
is
passed
if
he
accepts
it
and
your
innocence
it
is
well
he
will
not
betray
your
secret
voluntarily
nor
by
stupidity
but
he
will
not
accept
it
he
will
look
beyond
he
will
suppose
that
you
wish
to
deceive
him
and
he
will
suspect
you
in
that
case
would
he
not
go
and
tell
all
to
the
police
commissioner
of
our
quarter
as
for
me
i
think
it
is
a
danger
that
it
would
be
foolish
to
according
to
you
what
is
to
be
done
that
is
wait
since
there
are
a
thousand
chances
against
one
for
our
uneasiness
and
we
exaggerate
those
that
may
never
be
let
us
wait
he
said
i
like
that
at
the
least
i
have
no
responsibilities
what
can
happen

chapter
xix
the
knock
at
the
door
in
order
to
put
the
button
found
at
caffies
on
the
track
of
the
assassin
it
required
that
it
should
have
come
from
a
parisian
tailor
or
at
least
a
french
one
and
that
the
trousers
had
not
been
sold
by
a
where
the
names
of
customers
are
not
kept
the
task
of
the
police
was
therefore
difficult
as
weak
also
were
the
chances
of
success
as
saniel
had
said
it
was
like
looking
for
a
needle
in
a
bundle
of
hay
to
go
to
each
tailor
in
paris
but
this
was
not
their
way
of
proceeding
in
place
of
trying
to
find
those
who
used
these
buttons
they
looked
for
those
who
made
them
or
sold
them
and
suddenly
without
going
farther
than
the
directory
they
found
this
manufacturer
pelinotte
manufacturer
of
metal
buttons
for
trousers
trademark
crown
and
cock
faubourg
du
at
first
this
manufacturer
was
not
disposed
to
answer
questions
of
the
agent
who
went
to
see
him
but
when
he
began
to
understand
that
he
might
reap
some
advantage
from
the
affair
like
the
good
merchant
that
he
was
young
and
active
he
put
his
books
and
clerks
at
his
disposition
his
boast
was
in
effect
that
his
buttons
thanks
to
a
brass
bonnet
around
which
the
thread
was
rolled
instead
of
passing
through
the
holes
never
cut
the
thread
and
could
not
be
broken
when
they
came
off
it
was
with
a
piece
of
the
cloth
what
better
justification
of
his
pretensions
what
better
advertisement
than
his
button
torn
off
with
a
piece
of
the
trousers
of
the
assassin
the
affair
would
go
before
the
assizes
and
in
all
the
newspapers
there
would
be
mention
of
the
he
was
asked
for
his
names
and
after
a
few
days
the
search
began
guided
by
a
list
so
exact
that
useless
steps
were
spared
one
morning
a
detective
reached
the
avenue
de
clichy
and
found
the
tailor
valerius
in
his
shop
reading
a
newspaper
for
it
was
not
only
when
the
country
was
in
danger
that
valerius
had
a
passion
for
reading
papers
but
every
morning
and
evening
nothing
that
was
published
in
the
papers
escaped
him
and
at
the
first
words
of
the
agent
he
understood
immediately
about
what
he
was
to
be
questioned
is
concerning
the
affair
in
the
rue
that
you
wish
this
information
he
said
frankly
also
i
do
not
know
if
the
secrets
of
the
profession
permit
me
to
answer
the
agent
who
was
by
no
means
stupid
immediately
understood
the
character
and
instead
of
yielding
to
the
desire
to
laugh
caused
by
this
reply
honestly
made
by
this
man
whose
long
black
bushy
beard
and
bald
head
accentuated
his
gravity
he
yielded
to
the
necessity
of
the
occasion
is
a
question
to
let
us
discuss
it
a
customer
confiding
in
my
honesty
and
discretion
gives
me
an
order
to
make
a
pair
of
trousers
he
pays
me
as
he
agreed
without
beating
me
down
and
on
the
day
he
promised
we
are
loyal
to
each
other
i
give
him
a
pair
of
good
trousers
honestly
made
and
he
pays
me
with
good
money
we
are
even
have
i
the
right
afterward
by
imprudent
words
or
otherwise
to
furnish
clews
against
him
the
case
is
a
delicate
you
place
the
interest
of
the
individual
above
that
of
society
it
is
a
question
of
a
professional
secret
yes
where
should
we
be
if
the
lawyer
the
notary
the
doctor
the
confessor
the
tailor
could
accept
compromises
on
this
point
of
doctrine
it
would
be
anarchy
simply
and
in
the
end
it
would
be
the
interest
of
society
that
would
the
agent
who
had
no
time
to
lose
began
to
be
impatient
will
tell
you
he
said
the
tailor
however
important
his
profession
may
be
is
not
placed
exactly
as
the
doctor
or
confessor
have
you
not
a
book
in
which
you
write
your
orders
that
if
you
persevere
in
a
theory
pushing
it
to
an
extreme
i
need
only
to
go
to
the
commissioner
of
your
quarter
who
in
virtue
of
the
power
of
the
law
conferred
upon
him
will
seize
your
would
be
by
violence
and
my
responsibility
would
be
at
an
in
these
books
the
judge
would
see
to
whom
you
have
furnished
trousers
of
this
stuff
it
would
only
remain
then
to
discover
in
whose
interest
you
have
wished
to
escape
the
investigations
of
the
saying
this
he
took
from
his
pocket
a
small
box
and
taking
out
a
piece
of
paper
he
took
from
it
a
button
to
which
adhered
a
piece
of
navy
blue
stuff
valerius
who
was
not
in
the
least
moved
by
the
threat
of
the
commissioner
for
he
was
a
man
to
brave
martyrdom
looked
at
the
box
curiously
when
the
agent
displayed
the
button
a
movement
of
great
surprise
escaped
him
see
the
agent
exclaimed
you
know
this
cloth
you
permit
me
to
look
at
it
valerius
asked
but
on
condition
that
you
do
not
touch
it
it
is
valerius
took
the
box
and
approaching
the
front
of
the
shop
looked
at
the
button
and
the
piece
of
cloth
is
a
button
marked
as
you
see
and
we
know
that
you
use
these
do
not
deny
it
they
are
good
buttons
and
i
give
only
good
things
to
my
returning
the
box
to
the
agent
he
took
a
large
book
and
began
to
turn
over
the
leaves
pieces
of
cloth
were
pasted
on
the
pages
and
at
the
side
were
several
lines
of
large
handwriting
arriving
at
a
page
where
was
a
piece
of
blue
cloth
he
took
the
box
and
compared
this
piece
with
that
of
the
button
examining
it
by
daylight
he
said
am
going
to
tell
you
some
very
serious
am
hold
the
assassin
of
the
rue
and
it
is
i
who
will
give
you
the
means
of
discovering
have
made
trousers
of
this
cloth
have
made
three
pairs
but
there
is
only
one
pair
that
can
interest
you
that
of
the
assassin
i
have
just
told
you
that
the
secrets
of
the
profession
prevented
me
from
replying
to
your
questions
but
what
i
have
just
seen
frees
my
conscience
as
i
explained
to
you
when
i
make
a
pair
of
good
trousers
for
a
customer
who
pays
me
in
good
money
i
do
not
think
i
have
the
right
to
reveal
the
affairs
of
my
client
to
any
one
in
the
world
even
to
the
understand
interrupted
the
agent
whose
impatience
increased
this
reserve
on
my
part
rests
on
reciprocity
to
a
good
customer
a
good
tailor
if
the
customer
is
not
good
the
reciprocity
ceases
or
rather
it
continues
on
another
footing
that
of
war
if
any
one
treats
me
badly
i
return
the
same
the
trousers
to
which
this
stuff
he
showed
the
button
made
for
an
individual
whom
i
do
not
know
and
who
presented
himself
to
me
as
an
alsacian
which
i
believed
so
much
more
easily
because
he
spoke
with
a
strong
foreign
accent
these
trousers
i
need
not
tell
you
how
careful
i
was
with
them
i
am
a
patriot
sir
he
agreed
to
pay
for
them
on
delivery
when
they
were
delivered
the
young
apprentice
who
took
them
had
the
weakness
to
not
insist
upon
the
money
i
went
to
him
but
could
obtain
nothing
he
would
pay
me
the
next
day
and
so
on
finally
he
disappeared
leaving
no
this
customer
will
give
you
his
name
without
the
slightest
hesitation
fritzner
not
an
alsacian
as
i
believed
but
a
prussian
to
a
certainty
who
surely
struck
the
blow
his
disappearance
the
day
after
the
crime
is
the
proof
of
say
that
you
were
not
able
to
procure
his
address
you
who
have
other
means
at
your
disposal
can
find
him
he
is
or
thirty
years
old
of
middle
height
blue
eyes
a
blond
beard
and
a
complete
blue
suit
of
this
the
agent
wrote
this
description
in
his
as
the
tailor
gave
it
to
him
he
has
not
left
paris
with
these
stolen
thousand
francs
we
shall
find
him
and
the
thanks
will
be
yours
he
said
am
happy
to
be
able
to
do
anything
for
the
agent
was
going
but
he
thought
better
of
it
said
that
you
had
made
three
suits
of
this
cloth
but
there
is
only
this
fritzner
who
counts
the
two
others
are
honest
men
well
known
in
the
quarter
and
they
paid
me
they
have
no
cause
for
alarm
you
need
have
no
scruples
in
naming
them
it
is
not
in
the
name
of
justice
that
i
ask
their
names
but
for
they
will
look
well
in
my
report
and
will
prove
that
i
pushed
my
investigations
is
a
merchant
in
the
rue
truffant
and
is
called
monsieur
blanchet
the
other
is
a
young
man
just
arrived
from
america
and
his
name
is
monsieur
florentin
say
florentin
cormier
the
agent
asked
who
remembered
this
name
was
that
of
one
who
had
seen
caffie
on
the
day
of
the
crime
you
know
him
exactly
it
is
the
first
time
that
i
have
made
clothes
for
him
but
i
know
his
mother
and
sister
who
have
lived
in
the
rue
des
moines
five
or
six
years
at
least
good
honest
people
who
work
hard
and
have
no
the
next
morning
about
ten
a
short
time
after
departure
florentin
who
was
reading
the
newspaper
in
the
while
his
mother
prepared
the
breakfast
heard
stealthy
steps
that
stopped
on
the
landing
before
their
door
his
ear
was
too
familiar
with
the
ordinary
sounds
in
the
house
to
be
deceived
there
was
in
these
steps
a
hesitation
or
a
precaution
which
evidently
betrayed
a
stranger
and
with
the
few
connections
they
had
a
stranger
was
surely
an
enemy
the
one
whom
he
expected
a
ring
of
the
doorbell
given
by
a
firm
hand
made
him
jump
from
his
chair
he
did
not
hesitate
slowly
and
with
an
air
of
indifference
he
opened
the
door
he
saw
before
him
a
man
of
about
forty
years
with
a
polite
and
shrewd
face
dressed
in
a
short
coat
and
wearing
a
flat
hat
florentin
cormier
am
and
he
asked
him
to
come
in
judge
desires
to
see
you
at
his
madame
cormier
came
from
the
kitchen
in
time
to
hear
these
few
words
and
if
florentin
had
not
motioned
to
her
to
be
silent
she
would
have
betrayed
herself
the
words
on
her
lips
were
came
to
arrest
my
son
they
would
have
escaped
her
but
she
crushed
them
back
can
you
tell
me
for
what
affair
the
judge
summons
me
florentin
asked
steadying
his
voice
the
caffie
at
what
hour
should
i
present
myself
before
the
judge
my
son
has
not
breakfasted
madame
cormier
exclaimed
least
take
something
before
going
my
dear
is
not
worth
he
made
a
sign
to
her
that
she
should
not
insist
his
throat
was
too
tight
to
swallow
a
piece
of
bread
and
it
was
important
that
he
should
not
betray
his
emotion
before
this
agent
am
ready
he
said
going
to
his
mother
he
embraced
her
but
lightly
without
effusion
as
if
he
were
only
to
be
absent
a
short
time
she
was
distracted
but
understanding
that
she
would
compromise
her
son
if
she
yielded
to
her
feelings
she
controlled
herself
chapter
xx
a
tightening
chain
as
it
was
a
part
that
he
played
florentin
said
to
himself
that
he
would
play
it
to
the
best
of
his
ability
in
entering
the
skin
of
the
person
he
wished
to
be
and
this
part
was
that
of
a
witness
he
had
been
clerk
the
justice
would
interrogate
him
about
his
old
employer
and
nothing
would
be
more
natural
it
was
that
only
and
nothing
but
that
which
he
could
admit
consequently
he
should
interest
himself
in
the
police
investigations
and
have
the
curiosity
to
learn
how
they
stood
you
advanced
far
in
the
caffie
affair
he
asked
the
agent
as
they
walked
along
do
not
know
the
agent
answered
who
thought
it
prudent
to
be
reserved
know
nothing
more
than
the
newspapers
on
leaving
his
house
florentin
observed
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
a
man
who
appeared
to
be
stationed
there
at
the
end
of
several
minutes
on
turning
a
corner
he
saw
that
this
man
followed
them
at
a
certain
distance
then
it
was
not
a
simple
appearance
before
the
judge
for
such
precautions
are
not
taken
with
a
witness
when
they
reached
the
place
clichy
the
agent
asked
him
if
he
would
take
a
carriage
but
he
declined
what
good
was
it
it
was
a
useless
expense
then
he
saw
the
agent
raise
his
hat
as
if
bowing
to
some
one
but
this
bow
was
certainly
not
made
to
any
one
and
immediately
the
man
who
had
followed
them
approached
the
raising
of
the
hat
was
a
signal
as
from
the
deserted
quarters
of
the
batignolles
they
entered
the
crowd
they
feared
he
might
try
to
escape
the
character
of
the
arrest
became
accentuated
after
the
presentiments
and
fears
that
had
tormented
him
during
the
last
few
days
this
did
not
astonish
him
but
since
they
took
these
precautions
with
him
all
was
not
yet
decided
he
must
then
defend
himself
to
the
utmost
distracted
before
the
danger
came
he
felt
less
weak
now
that
he
was
in
it
on
arriving
at
the
palais
de
justice
he
was
introduced
immediately
into
the
office
but
he
did
not
attend
to
him
at
once
he
was
questioning
a
woman
and
florentin
examined
him
by
stealth
he
saw
a
man
of
elegant
and
easy
figure
still
young
with
nothing
solemn
or
imposing
about
him
having
more
the
air
of
a
boulevardier
or
of
a
sportsman
than
of
a
magistrate
while
continuing
his
questioning
he
also
examined
florentin
but
with
a
rapid
glance
without
persistence
carelessly
and
simply
because
his
eyes
fell
upon
him
before
a
table
a
clerk
was
writing
and
near
the
door
two
policemen
waited
with
the
weary
empty
faces
of
men
whose
minds
are
elsewhere
soon
the
judge
turned
his
head
toward
them
may
take
away
the
then
immediately
addressing
florentin
he
asked
him
his
name
his
christian
names
and
his
residence
have
been
the
clerk
of
the
agent
of
affairs
caffie
why
did
you
leave
him
my
work
was
too
are
afraid
of
work
when
it
is
not
too
hard
it
was
at
his
office
and
left
me
no
time
to
work
for
myself
i
was
obliged
to
reach
his
office
at
eight
in
the
morning
breakfast
there
and
did
not
leave
until
seven
to
dine
with
my
mother
at
the
batignolles
i
had
an
hour
and
a
half
for
that
at
eight
i
had
to
return
and
stay
until
ten
or
in
accepting
this
position
i
believed
that
i
should
be
able
to
finish
my
education
interrupted
by
the
death
of
my
father
and
to
study
law
and
become
something
better
than
a
miserable
clerk
of
a
business
man
it
was
impossible
with
monsieur
caffie
so
i
left
him
and
this
was
the
only
reason
why
we
have
you
been
since
this
was
a
delicate
question
and
one
that
florentin
dreaded
for
it
might
raise
prejudices
that
nothing
would
destroy
however
he
must
reply
for
what
he
would
not
tell
himself
others
would
reveal
an
investigation
on
this
point
was
too
easy
another
business
man
monsieur
savoureux
rue
de
la
victoire
where
i
was
not
obliged
to
work
in
the
evening
i
stayed
there
about
three
months
and
then
went
to
when
i
began
to
study
seriously
i
found
that
my
studies
had
been
neglected
too
long
to
make
it
possible
for
me
to
take
them
up
again
i
had
forgotten
nearly
all
i
had
learned
i
should
without
doubt
fail
in
my
examination
and
i
should
only
begin
the
law
too
late
i
left
france
for
america
where
i
hoped
to
find
a
good
long
since
your
return
you
went
to
see
caffie
for
ask
him
for
a
recommendation
to
replace
the
one
he
gave
me
which
i
had
was
the
day
of
the
crime
what
time
reached
his
house
about
a
quarter
to
three
and
i
left
about
he
give
you
the
certificate
for
which
you
asked
here
it
and
taking
it
from
his
pocket
he
presented
it
to
the
judge
it
was
a
paper
saying
that
during
the
time
that
florentin
cormier
was
his
clerk
caffie
was
entirely
satisfied
with
him
with
his
work
as
with
his
accuracy
and
probity
you
did
not
return
to
him
during
the
evening
the
judge
asked
should
i
return
i
had
obtained
what
i
did
you
or
did
you
not
return
did
not
return
to
you
remember
what
you
did
on
leaving
house
if
florentin
had
indulged
in
the
smallest
illusion
about
his
appearance
before
the
judge
the
manner
of
conducting
the
interview
would
have
destroyed
it
it
was
not
a
witness
who
was
being
questioned
it
was
a
culprit
he
had
not
to
enlighten
the
justice
he
had
to
defend
himself
he
said
is
not
so
long
ago
on
leaving
the
rue
as
i
had
nothing
to
do
i
went
down
to
the
quays
and
looked
at
the
old
books
from
the
pont
royale
to
the
institute
but
at
this
moment
a
heavy
shower
came
on
and
i
returned
to
the
batignolles
where
i
remained
with
my
time
was
it
when
you
reached
your
house
few
minutes
after
you
not
say
exactly
a
quarter
past
five
a
few
minutes
more
or
you
did
not
go
out
again
any
one
call
at
your
after
you
arrived
there
one
my
sister
came
in
at
seven
as
usual
when
she
returned
from
her
you
went
up
to
your
rooms
did
you
speak
with
any
of
the
other
lodgers
there
was
a
pause
and
florentin
felt
the
eyes
fixed
on
him
with
an
aggravating
persistency
it
seemed
as
if
this
look
which
enveloped
him
from
head
to
foot
wished
to
penetrate
his
inmost
thoughts
thing
said
the
judge
did
not
lose
a
button
while
you
were
with
caffie
florentin
expected
this
question
and
for
some
time
he
had
considered
what
answer
he
should
make
to
it
to
deny
was
impossible
it
would
be
easy
to
convict
him
of
a
fib
for
the
fact
of
the
question
being
asked
was
sufficient
to
say
there
was
proof
that
the
button
was
his
he
must
then
confess
the
truth
grave
as
it
might
be
he
said
this
is
how
he
related
in
detail
the
story
of
the
bundle
of
papers
placed
on
the
highest
shelf
of
the
cases
his
slipping
on
the
ladder
and
the
loss
of
the
button
which
he
did
not
discover
until
he
was
in
the
street
the
judge
opened
a
drawer
and
took
from
it
a
small
box
from
which
he
took
a
button
that
he
handed
to
florentin
that
it
he
asked
florentin
looked
at
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
answer
he
said
finally
button
resembles
that
case
it
would
be
necessary
for
me
to
have
observed
the
form
of
the
one
i
lost
and
i
gave
no
attention
to
it
it
seems
to
me
that
no
one
knows
exactly
how
or
of
what
the
buttons
are
made
that
they
the
judge
examined
him
anew
are
not
the
trousers
that
you
wear
the
same
from
which
this
button
was
torn
is
the
pair
i
wore
the
day
i
called
on
monsieur
it
is
quite
easy
to
compare
the
button
that
i
show
you
with
those
on
your
trousers
and
your
answer
becomes
it
was
impossible
to
escape
this
verification
your
vest
said
the
judge
make
your
comparison
with
care
with
all
the
care
that
you
think
wise
the
question
has
some
florentin
felt
it
only
too
much
the
importance
of
this
question
but
as
it
was
set
before
him
he
could
not
but
answer
frankly
he
unbuttoned
his
waistcoat
and
compared
the
button
with
his
believe
that
it
is
really
the
button
that
i
lost
he
said
although
he
endeavored
not
to
betray
his
anguish
he
felt
that
his
voice
trembled
and
that
it
had
a
hoarse
sound
then
he
wished
to
explain
this
emotion
is
a
truly
terrible
position
for
me
he
said
the
judge
did
not
reply
because
i
lost
a
button
at
monsieur
it
does
not
follow
that
it
was
torn
off
in
a
have
your
theory
and
you
will
make
the
most
of
it
but
this
is
not
the
place
i
have
only
one
more
question
to
ask
by
what
button
have
you
replaced
the
one
you
lost
the
first
one
i
came
sewed
it
on
you
in
the
habit
of
sewing
on
your
buttons
yourself
although
the
judge
did
not
press
this
question
by
his
tone
nor
by
the
form
in
which
he
made
it
florentin
saw
the
strength
of
the
accusation
that
his
reply
would
make
against
him
he
said
yet
on
returning
home
you
found
your
mother
you
told
me
was
there
any
reason
why
she
could
not
sew
this
button
on
for
you
did
not
ask
her
to
do
when
she
saw
you
sewing
it
did
she
not
take
the
needle
from
your
hands
did
not
see
was
occupied
preparing
our
is
was
in
the
entry
of
our
apartment
where
i
have
slept
since
my
return
my
mother
was
in
the
there
no
communication
between
the
kitchen
and
the
entry
door
was
a
flood
of
words
rushed
to
his
lips
to
protest
against
the
conclusions
which
seemed
to
follow
these
answers
but
he
kept
them
back
he
saw
himself
caught
in
a
net
and
all
his
efforts
to
free
himself
only
bound
him
more
strongly
as
he
was
asked
no
more
questions
it
seemed
to
him
best
to
say
nothing
and
he
was
silent
a
long
time
of
the
duration
of
which
he
was
only
vaguely
conscious
the
judge
talked
in
a
low
tone
the
recorder
wrote
rapidly
and
he
heard
only
a
monotonous
murmur
that
interrupted
the
scratching
of
a
pen
on
the
paper
testimony
will
now
be
read
to
you
the
judge
said
he
wished
to
give
all
his
attention
to
this
reading
but
he
soon
lost
the
thread
of
it
the
impression
it
made
upon
him
however
was
that
it
faithfully
reproduced
all
that
he
had
said
and
he
signed
it
said
the
judge
duty
obliges
me
in
presence
of
the
charges
which
emanate
from
your
testimony
to
deliver
against
you
a
florentin
received
this
blow
without
flinching
know
he
said
all
the
protestations
i
might
make
would
have
no
effect
at
this
moment
i
therefore
spare
you
them
but
i
have
a
favor
to
ask
of
you
it
is
to
permit
me
to
write
to
my
mother
and
sister
the
news
of
my
arrest
they
love
me
tenderly
oh
you
shall
read
my
letter
may
chapter
xxi
the
caffie
after
the
departure
of
her
son
and
the
detective
madame
cormier
was
prostrated
her
son
her
florentin
the
poor
child
and
she
was
sunk
in
despair
had
they
not
suffered
enough
was
this
new
proof
necessary
why
had
their
life
been
so
unmercifully
cruel
why
had
not
saniel
let
her
die
at
least
she
would
not
have
seen
this
last
catastrophe
this
disgrace
her
son
accused
of
assassination
in
prison
at
the
assizes
heretofore
when
she
had
yielded
to
her
feelings
and
bewailed
their
sad
lot
phillis
was
at
hand
to
cheer
and
caress
her
but
now
she
was
alone
in
her
deserted
apartment
no
one
to
hear
her
see
her
nor
scold
why
should
she
not
abandon
herself
to
tears
she
wept
and
trembled
but
the
moment
arrived
when
after
having
reached
the
extreme
of
despair
which
showed
her
her
son
condemned
as
an
assassin
and
executed
she
stopped
and
asked
herself
if
she
had
not
gone
too
far
he
would
return
certainly
she
might
expect
him
and
she
waited
for
him
without
breakfasting
he
would
not
like
to
sit
down
to
the
table
all
alone
the
poor
child
besides
she
was
too
profoundly
overcome
to
eat
she
arranged
the
fire
with
care
so
that
the
haricot
of
mutton
would
keep
warm
for
it
was
his
favorite
dish
minutes
and
hours
passed
and
he
did
not
return
her
anguish
came
back
a
witness
would
not
be
retained
so
long
by
the
judge
had
they
arrested
him
then
what
would
become
of
him
she
fell
into
a
state
of
tears
and
despair
and
longed
for
phillis
fortunately
she
would
not
be
late
finally
a
quick
light
step
was
heard
on
the
landing
and
as
soon
as
she
could
madame
cormier
went
to
open
the
door
and
was
stunned
on
seeing
the
agitated
face
of
her
daughter
evidently
phillis
was
surprised
by
the
sudden
opening
of
the
door
know
all
then
madame
cormier
cried
phillis
put
her
arms
about
her
and
drew
her
into
the
where
she
made
her
sit
down
she
said
will
not
keep
know
some
way
will
find
a
way
i
promise
you
that
they
will
not
keep
are
sure
promise
give
me
life
but
how
did
you
know
wrote
to
me
the
concierge
gave
me
his
letter
which
had
just
does
he
say
madame
cormier
took
the
letter
that
phillis
handed
her
but
the
paper
shook
so
violently
in
her
trembling
hand
that
she
could
not
read
it
to
phillis
took
it
and
read
little
sister
after
listening
to
my
story
the
judge
retains
me
soften
for
mamma
the
pain
of
this
blow
make
her
understand
that
they
will
soon
acknowledge
the
falseness
of
this
accusation
and
on
your
part
try
to
make
this
falseness
evident
while
on
mine
i
will
work
to
prove
my
innocence
poor
mamma
for
me
and
find
in
your
tenderness
strength
and
love
some
consolation
for
her
mine
will
be
to
think
that
you
are
near
her
dear
little
beloved
sister
it
is
this
honest
boy
that
they
accuse
of
assassination
cried
madame
cormier
beginning
to
weep
it
required
several
minutes
for
phillis
to
quiet
her
a
little
must
think
of
him
mamma
we
must
not
give
are
going
to
do
something
are
you
not
my
little
phillis
am
going
to
find
doctor
is
a
doctor
not
a
is
exactly
as
a
doctor
that
he
can
save
florentin
he
knows
that
caffie
was
killed
without
a
struggle
between
him
and
the
assassin
consequently
without
the
wrenching
off
of
a
button
he
will
say
it
and
prove
it
to
the
judge
and
innocence
is
evident
i
am
going
to
see
beg
of
you
do
not
leave
me
alone
too
will
come
back
phillis
ran
from
the
batignolles
to
the
rue
in
answer
to
her
ring
joseph
who
had
returned
to
his
place
in
the
anteroom
opened
the
door
and
as
saniel
was
alone
she
went
immediately
to
his
office
is
the
matter
he
asked
on
seeing
her
agitation
brother
is
the
poor
boy
what
he
had
said
to
her
on
explaining
that
this
arrest
could
not
take
place
was
sincere
he
believed
it
and
he
more
than
believed
it
he
wished
it
when
he
decided
to
kill
caffie
he
had
not
thought
that
the
law
would
ever
discover
a
criminal
it
would
be
a
crime
that
would
remain
unpunished
as
so
many
were
and
no
one
would
be
disturbed
but
now
the
law
had
found
and
arrested
one
who
was
the
brother
of
the
woman
he
loved
was
he
arrested
he
asked
as
much
for
the
sake
of
knowing
as
to
recover
himself
she
told
what
she
knew
and
read
letter
is
a
good
boy
your
brother
he
said
as
if
talking
to
himself
will
save
him
can
i
this
cry
escaped
him
without
her
understanding
its
weight
without
her
divining
the
expression
of
anxious
curiosity
in
his
glance
whom
shall
i
address
myself
if
not
to
you
are
you
not
everything
to
me
my
support
my
guide
my
counsel
my
god
she
explained
what
she
wished
him
to
do
once
more
an
exclamation
escaped
saniel
wish
me
to
go
to
the
judge
me
better
than
you
can
explain
how
things
happened
saniel
who
had
recovered
from
his
first
feeling
of
surprise
did
not
flinch
evidently
she
spoke
with
entire
honesty
suspecting
nothing
and
it
would
be
folly
to
look
for
more
than
she
said
i
can
not
present
myself
before
a
judge
in
such
away
he
said
is
he
who
sends
for
those
he
wants
to
can
you
not
go
to
his
court
since
you
know
things
which
will
throw
light
upon
it
it
truly
easy
to
go
before
this
court
in
going
before
it
i
make
myself
the
defender
of
your
is
exactly
what
i
ask
of
in
presenting
myself
as
his
defender
i
take
away
the
weight
of
my
deposition
which
would
have
more
authority
if
it
were
that
of
a
simple
when
will
you
be
asked
for
this
deposition
think
of
sufferings
during
this
time
of
and
of
mine
he
may
lose
his
head
he
may
kill
himself
his
spirit
is
not
strong
nor
is
how
will
they
bear
all
that
the
newspapers
will
publish
saniel
hesitated
a
moment
i
will
go
he
said
this
evening
it
is
too
late
but
dear
victor
she
exclaimed
pressing
him
in
her
arms
knew
that
you
would
save
him
we
will
owe
you
his
life
as
we
owe
you
as
i
owe
you
happiness
am
i
not
right
to
say
you
are
my
god
after
she
was
gone
he
had
a
moment
of
repentance
in
which
he
regretted
this
weakness
for
it
was
a
weakness
a
stupid
sentimentalism
unworthy
of
a
sensible
man
who
should
not
permit
himself
to
be
thus
touched
and
involved
why
should
he
go
and
invite
danger
when
he
could
be
quiet
without
any
one
giving
him
a
thought
was
it
not
folly
the
law
wanted
a
criminal
public
curiosity
demanded
one
why
take
away
the
one
that
they
had
if
he
succeeded
would
they
not
look
for
another
it
was
imprudence
and
to
use
the
true
word
madness
now
that
he
was
no
longer
under
the
influence
of
beautiful
tearful
eyes
he
would
not
commit
this
imprudence
all
the
evening
this
idea
strengthened
and
when
he
went
to
bed
his
resolution
was
taken
he
would
not
go
to
the
judge
but
on
awakening
he
was
surprised
to
find
that
this
resolution
of
the
evening
was
not
that
of
the
morning
and
that
this
dual
personality
which
had
already
struck
him
asserted
itself
anew
it
was
at
night
that
he
resolved
to
kill
caffie
and
he
committed
the
deed
in
the
evening
it
was
in
the
morning
that
he
had
abandoned
the
idea
as
it
was
in
the
morning
that
he
revoked
the
decision
made
the
previous
evening
not
to
go
to
the
rescue
of
this
poor
boy
of
what
then
was
the
will
of
man
made
undulating
like
the
sea
and
variable
as
the
wind
that
he
had
the
folly
to
believe
his
was
firm
at
noon
he
went
to
the
palais
de
justice
and
sent
in
his
card
to
the
judge
on
which
he
wrote
these
words
the
caffie
he
was
received
almost
immediately
and
briefly
explained
how
according
to
his
opinion
caffie
was
killed
quickly
and
suddenly
by
a
firm
and
skilful
hand
that
of
a
killer
by
profession
is
the
conclusion
of
your
report
the
judge
said
i
could
not
point
out
in
my
report
as
i
did
not
know
of
the
finding
of
the
button
and
the
opinion
it
has
led
to
is
that
there
was
no
struggle
between
the
assassin
and
the
victim
as
is
generally
and
medically
he
demonstrated
how
this
struggle
was
impossible
the
judge
listened
attentively
without
a
word
without
interruption
you
know
this
young
man
he
asked
have
seen
him
only
once
but
i
know
his
mother
who
was
my
patient
and
it
is
at
her
instigation
that
i
decided
to
make
this
explanation
to
doubt
it
has
its
value
but
i
must
tell
you
that
it
tends
in
no
way
to
destroy
our
if
it
has
no
foundation
must
tell
you
that
you
are
negative
doctor
and
not
suggestive
we
have
a
criminal
and
you
have
not
do
you
see
one
saniel
thought
that
the
judge
looked
at
him
with
a
disagreeable
persistency
he
said
sharply
then
rising
he
said
more
calmly
is
not
in
my
he
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
retire
which
he
did
and
on
passing
through
the
vestibule
he
said
to
himself
that
the
magistrate
was
right
he
believed
that
he
held
a
criminal
why
should
he
let
him
go
as
for
him
he
had
done
what
he
could
chapter
xxii
bride
saniel
passed
the
first
proofs
of
his
two
so
brilliantly
that
the
results
of
either
were
not
doubtful
in
delivering
his
thesis
for
the
he
commanded
the
admiration
of
his
audience
by
turns
aggressive
severe
ironical
eloquent
he
reduced
his
adversary
to
such
an
extremity
that
overwhelmed
he
was
not
able
to
reply
in
his
lecture
at
the
hospital
his
eloquence
and
his
clear
demonstration
convinced
the
judges
who
were
opposed
to
him
that
he
was
in
the
right
what
could
death
weigh
placed
in
the
balance
with
these
results
so
little
that
it
counted
for
nothing
and
would
have
held
no
place
in
his
thoughts
if
it
had
not
been
mixed
in
his
mind
with
the
accusation
that
would
send
florentin
to
the
assizes
cleared
of
this
fact
the
death
of
the
old
man
rarely
crossed
his
mind
he
had
other
things
in
his
head
truly
than
this
memory
which
brought
neither
regret
nor
remorse
and
it
was
not
at
this
moment
when
he
touched
the
end
at
which
he
aimed
that
he
would
embarrass
himself
or
sadden
his
triumph
with
caffie
a
little
before
the
expiration
of
the
two
months
during
which
time
the
poste
restante
retained
the
letters
containing
the
thirty
thousand
francs
he
called
for
them
and
readdressed
and
mailed
them
to
other
what
did
he
want
of
this
money
which
was
in
reality
a
nuisance
his
habits
remained
the
same
except
that
he
no
longer
struggled
with
his
creditors
and
paid
cash
for
everything
he
had
no
desire
to
make
any
change
in
his
former
mode
of
living
his
ambition
was
otherwise
and
higher
than
in
the
small
satisfactions
very
small
for
him
that
money
gives
days
passed
without
a
thought
of
caffie
except
in
connection
with
florentin
but
florentin
and
above
all
phillis
reminded
him
that
the
comfort
he
enjoyed
he
owed
to
death
and
he
was
troubled
accordingly
he
did
not
believe
that
the
investigations
of
the
law
would
reach
him
now
everything
conspired
to
confirm
him
in
his
scrutiny
that
which
he
arranged
so
laboriously
had
succeeded
according
to
his
wish
and
the
only
imprudence
that
he
had
committed
in
a
moment
of
aberration
seemed
not
to
have
been
observed
no
one
had
noticed
his
presence
in
the
cafe
opposite
house
and
no
one
was
astonished
at
his
pertinacity
in
remaining
there
at
an
hour
so
unusual
but
it
was
not
enough
that
he
was
safe
he
must
prevent
florentin
from
being
unjustly
condemned
for
a
crime
of
which
he
was
innocent
it
was
a
great
deal
that
he
should
be
imprisoned
that
his
sister
should
be
in
despair
and
his
mother
ill
from
chagrin
but
if
he
should
be
sent
to
the
scaffold
or
to
the
galleys
it
would
be
too
much
in
itself
the
death
of
caffie
was
a
small
thing
it
became
atrocious
if
it
led
to
such
an
ending
he
did
not
wish
this
to
happen
and
he
would
do
everything
not
only
to
prevent
the
condemnation
but
to
shorten
the
imprisonment
it
was
this
sentiment
that
he
obeyed
in
going
to
see
the
judge
but
the
manner
in
which
he
was
received
showing
him
that
the
law
was
not
disposed
to
let
its
hypothesis
be
changed
by
a
simple
medical
demonstration
threw
him
into
a
state
of
uneasiness
and
perplexity
without
doubt
any
one
else
in
his
place
would
have
let
things
take
their
course
and
since
the
law
had
a
criminal
with
which
it
contented
itself
would
have
done
nothing
to
release
him
while
it
followed
its
hypothesis
to
prove
the
criminality
of
the
one
it
held
it
would
not
look
elsewhere
when
it
had
condemned
him
all
would
be
finished
the
caffie
affair
would
be
buried
as
caffie
himself
was
buried
silence
and
oblivion
would
give
him
security
the
crime
punished
the
conscience
of
the
public
satisfied
it
would
ask
for
no
more
not
even
to
know
if
the
debt
was
paid
by
the
one
who
really
owed
it
it
was
paid
and
that
was
sufficient
but
he
was
not
one
else
and
if
he
found
the
death
of
this
old
scamp
legitimate
it
was
on
the
condition
that
florentin
did
not
pay
for
it
from
whom
he
had
not
profited
florentin
must
be
released
as
soon
as
possible
and
it
was
his
duty
to
interest
himself
in
his
behalf
his
imperative
duty
not
only
toward
phillis
but
toward
himself
he
told
phillis
that
until
florentin
came
before
the
jury
he
could
do
nothing
or
almost
nothing
when
the
time
came
he
would
assert
his
authority
and
speaking
in
the
name
of
science
he
would
prove
to
the
jury
that
the
story
of
the
button
was
an
invention
of
the
police
who
were
pushed
to
extremes
and
would
not
bear
examination
but
until
then
the
poor
boy
remained
at
mazas
and
however
assured
one
might
be
at
this
moment
of
an
acquittal
an
immediate
de
was
of
more
value
if
it
could
be
obtained
for
this
the
intervention
and
direction
of
a
doctor
were
of
little
use
it
required
that
of
an
advocate
whom
should
he
have
phillis
would
have
liked
to
apply
to
the
most
illustrious
to
him
who
by
his
talent
authority
and
success
would
win
all
his
cases
but
saniel
explained
to
her
that
workers
of
miracles
were
probably
as
difficult
to
find
at
the
bar
as
in
the
medical
profession
and
that
if
they
did
exist
they
would
expect
a
large
fee
to
tell
the
truth
he
would
have
willingly
given
the
thirty
thousand
francs
in
the
or
a
large
part
of
this
sum
to
give
florentin
his
liberty
but
it
would
be
imprudent
to
take
out
the
bills
at
this
moment
and
he
could
not
declare
that
he
had
thirty
thousand
francs
or
even
ten
thousand
he
decided
with
phillis
to
consult
brigard
on
a
wednesday
he
went
to
the
parlor
in
the
rue
vaugirard
where
he
had
not
been
since
his
experiment
with
glady
as
usual
he
was
received
affectionately
by
crozat
who
scolded
him
for
coming
so
rarely
and
as
usual
also
in
order
not
to
disturb
the
discussion
that
was
going
on
he
remained
standing
near
the
door
this
evening
the
theme
of
the
discourse
was
a
phrase
of
tiger
kills
and
sleeps
man
kills
and
is
on
listening
to
the
discussion
saniel
said
to
himself
that
it
was
truly
a
pity
not
to
be
able
to
reply
to
all
this
rhetoric
by
a
simple
fact
of
personal
experience
he
had
never
slept
so
well
so
tranquilly
as
since
death
which
relieved
him
from
all
the
cares
that
in
these
last
months
had
tormented
and
broken
his
sleep
so
much
at
the
end
brigard
concluded
the
discussion
on
saying
that
nothing
better
proved
the
power
of
the
human
conscience
than
this
difference
between
man
and
beast
when
they
had
all
gone
but
brigard
and
saniel
was
alone
with
him
and
crozat
he
stated
his
desire
is
it
the
caffie
affair
and
he
explained
in
detail
the
interest
he
felt
in
florentin
the
son
of
one
of
his
patients
and
also
the
situation
of
this
patient
brigard
strongly
recommended
nougarede
and
described
his
recent
successes
before
a
jury
crozat
concurred
with
brigard
and
advised
saniel
to
see
nougarede
the
day
after
the
morning
because
after
the
palais
nougarede
will
be
at
his
wedding
which
as
you
know
prevents
him
from
coming
here
this
nougarede
married
exclaimed
saniel
surprised
that
the
favorite
disciple
gave
this
lie
to
the
doctrine
and
examples
of
his
master
god
yes
we
must
not
be
too
hard
on
him
submits
to
the
fate
of
a
special
environment
without
our
knowledge
nougarede
we
may
say
it
now
and
ought
to
say
it
was
the
happy
lover
of
a
charming
young
person
the
daughter
of
one
of
our
most
distinguished
actresses
who
was
brought
up
in
a
fashionable
convent
you
see
the
situation
the
result
of
this
liaison
was
a
child
a
delicious
little
boy
it
seemed
quite
natural
that
they
should
live
union
since
they
loved
each
other
and
not
weaken
by
legalities
the
strength
of
those
that
attached
them
to
this
child
but
the
mother
is
an
actress
as
i
have
told
you
and
wished
her
daughter
to
receive
all
the
sacraments
that
the
law
and
the
church
can
confer
she
managed
so
well
that
poor
nougarede
yielded
he
goes
to
the
mayor
to
the
church
he
legitimizes
the
child
and
he
even
accepts
a
dot
of
two
hundred
thousand
francs
i
pity
him
the
unfortunate
man
but
i
confess
that
i
have
the
weakness
to
not
condemn
him
as
he
would
deserve
if
he
married
in
any
other
saniel
was
a
little
surprised
at
these
points
of
resemblance
with
the
charming
young
person
that
caffie
had
proposed
to
him
at
the
least
it
was
curious
but
if
it
were
the
same
woman
he
was
not
vexed
to
see
that
nougarede
had
been
less
difficult
than
himself
chapter

stunning
news
on
going
to
see
nougarede
saniel
vaguely
fancied
the
lawyer
would
tell
him
that
an
acquittal
was
certain
if
florentin
passed
to
the
assizes
and
even
that
an
de
was
probable
but
his
hope
was
not
realized
adventure
of
the
button
for
you
or
me
would
not
have
the
same
gravity
as
for
this
boy
we
have
no
antecedents
on
which
presumptions
might
be
established
but
he
has
the
francs
which
constitute
an
embezzlement
for
a
salaried
man
will
be
certainly
a
for
the
accusation
one
commences
by
a
weakness
and
finishes
by
a
crime
do
you
not
hear
the
he
will
begin
by
presenting
the
portrait
of
the
honest
laborious
exact
scrupulous
clerk
content
with
a
little
and
getting
satisfaction
from
his
duties
accomplished
then
in
opposition
he
will
pass
to
the
clerk
of
as
irregular
in
his
work
as
in
his
conduct
full
of
desires
in
a
hurry
to
enjoy
discontented
with
everything
and
everybody
with
others
as
with
himself
and
he
will
go
on
to
speak
of
the
embezzlement
of
the
francs
as
the
beginning
of
the
crimes
that
led
to
the
assassination
you
may
be
sure
if
the
affair
goes
to
the
assizes
that
you
will
hear
these
words
and
more
and
i
assure
you
that
it
will
be
difficult
for
us
to
destroy
the
impression
that
he
will
produce
on
the
jury
but
i
hope
we
shall
he
had
to
give
up
the
idea
of
obtaining
the
de
and
to
tell
himself
that
the
would
come
before
the
assizes
but
it
does
not
follow
that
one
is
condemned
for
what
one
is
accused
of
and
saniel
persisted
in
believing
that
florentin
would
not
be
assuredly
the
prison
was
hard
for
the
poor
boy
and
the
trial
before
the
jury
with
all
the
ignominy
that
necessarily
accompanies
it
would
be
harder
yet
but
after
all
it
would
all
disappear
in
the
joy
of
acquittal
when
that
time
came
there
would
be
found
surely
some
ingenious
idea
sympathy
effective
support
to
pay
him
for
all
that
he
would
have
suffered
certainly
things
would
come
to
pass
thus
and
the
acquittal
would
be
carried
with
a
high
hand
he
said
this
to
himself
again
and
again
and
from
the
day
when
he
put
the
affair
in
hands
he
often
went
to
see
him
to
hear
him
repeat
it
can
not
be
condemned
can
he
may
always
be
condemned
even
when
one
is
innocent
as
one
may
die
at
any
time
you
know
that
even
with
excellent
in
one
of
these
visits
he
met
madame
nougarede
who
had
then
been
several
days
married
and
on
recognizing
in
her
the
young
virgin
with
a
child
of
whom
caffie
showed
him
the
portrait
he
was
strengthened
in
his
idea
that
conscience
such
as
it
was
understood
was
decidedly
a
strange
which
might
be
made
to
say
whatever
one
chose
of
what
good
were
these
hypocrisies
and
whom
did
they
deceive
although
he
had
told
phillis
repeatedly
that
an
acquittal
was
certain
and
that
he
had
promised
her
he
would
do
all
he
could
for
florentin
which
he
really
did
she
did
not
give
entirely
into
his
hands
or
into
the
task
of
defending
her
brother
but
worked
with
them
in
his
defence
nougarede
believed
that
the
delay
in
bringing
the
affair
before
the
assizes
was
caused
by
the
attempts
to
learn
if
during
his
residence
in
america
florentin
had
not
worked
in
some
large
or
sheepfold
where
he
would
have
learned
to
use
a
butcher
knife
which
was
the
chief
point
for
the
accusation
phillis
wrote
to
the
various
towns
where
florentin
had
lived
and
to
tell
the
truth
he
had
worked
at
la
plata
for
six
months
as
accountant
in
a
large
sheepfold
but
never
slaughtered
the
sheep
when
she
received
a
letter
she
carried
it
immediately
to
saniel
and
then
to
nougarede
and
at
the
same
time
on
all
sides
in
paris
among
those
who
had
held
relations
with
her
brother
she
sought
for
testimony
that
should
prove
to
the
jury
that
he
could
not
be
the
man
that
his
accusers
believed
him
it
was
thus
that
all
alone
without
other
means
of
action
than
those
which
she
found
in
her
sisterly
tenderness
and
bravery
she
organized
an
investigation
parallel
to
that
of
the
law
which
on
the
day
of
judgment
would
carry
a
certain
weight
it
seemed
with
the
conviction
of
the
jury
showing
them
what
had
been
the
true
life
of
this
irregular
and
debauched
man
capable
of
anything
to
glut
his
appetite
and
satisfy
his
desires
each
time
that
she
obtained
a
favorable
deposition
she
ran
to
saniel
to
tell
him
and
then
together
they
repeated
that
a
conviction
was
impossible
are
sure
are
you
not
i
not
always
told
you
so
he
had
also
said
that
florentin
could
not
be
arrested
basing
the
accusation
on
the
torn
button
and
he
had
said
that
certainly
an
de
would
be
given
by
the
judge
but
they
wished
to
remember
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
things
had
reached
this
state
when
one
saturday
evening
phillis
arrived
at
radiant
as
soon
as
the
door
opened
she
exclaimed
is
saved
ordonnance
de
but
now
it
is
of
little
importance
we
can
go
to
the
she
breathed
a
sigh
which
showed
how
great
were
her
fears
in
spite
of
the
confidence
she
expressed
when
she
repeated
that
conviction
was
impossible
he
left
his
desk
and
going
toward
her
took
her
in
his
arms
and
made
her
sit
down
beside
him
on
the
divan
will
see
that
i
do
not
let
myself
be
carried
away
by
an
illusion
and
that
as
i
tell
you
he
is
saved
really
saved
you
know
that
an
illustrated
paper
has
published
his
portrait
do
not
read
illustrated
could
have
seen
them
at
the
kiosks
where
they
are
displayed
it
is
there
that
i
saw
them
yesterday
morning
when
i
went
out
and
i
was
petrified
red
with
shame
distracted
not
knowing
where
to
hide
myself
cormier
the
assassin
of
the
rue
is
it
not
infamous
that
an
innocent
person
should
be
thus
dishonored
this
was
what
i
said
to
myself
where
did
the
paper
get
the
photograph
they
came
to
ask
us
for
one
but
you
can
imagine
how
i
treated
them
not
knowing
how
anything
good
for
us
would
result
from
such
a
what
is
the
result
proof
that
it
is
not
florentin
who
was
with
caffie
at
the
moment
when
the
assassination
took
place
all
day
yesterday
and
all
this
morning
i
was
filled
with
the
feeling
of
disgrace
that
followed
me
when
at
three
i
received
this
little
note
from
the
concierge
of
the
rue
she
took
from
her
pocket
a
piece
of
paper
folded
in
the
form
of
a
letter
which
she
handed
to
saniel
if
you
will
pass
through
the
rue
i
have
something
to
tell
you
that
will
give
you
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
i
believe
am
your
servant
anais
know
the
lame
old
concierge
has
never
been
willing
to
admit
that
my
brother
could
be
guilty
florentin
was
polite
and
kind
to
her
during
his
stay
with
caffie
and
she
is
grateful
very
often
she
has
said
to
me
that
she
is
certain
the
guilty
one
would
be
found
and
that
when
it
was
announced
i
must
tell
her
instead
of
my
telling
her
the
good
news
she
has
written
to
me
you
may
be
sure
i
hurried
to
the
rue
expecting
to
hear
something
favorable
but
we
have
a
proof
when
i
arrived
the
old
woman
took
both
of
my
hands
and
told
me
that
she
would
conduct
me
immediately
to
a
lady
who
saw
him
exclaimed
saniel
struck
by
a
blow
that
shook
him
from
head
to
foot
saw
him
perfectly
as
i
tell
you
she
added
that
this
lady
was
the
proprietor
of
the
house
and
that
she
lived
in
the
second
wing
of
the
building
on
the
second
story
on
the
court
just
opposite
to
office
this
lady
who
is
called
madame
dammauville
widow
of
a
lawyer
is
afflicted
with
paralysis
and
i
believe
has
not
left
her
room
for
a
year
the
concierge
explained
this
to
me
while
crossing
the
court
and
mounting
the
stairs
but
would
say
no
if
phillis
had
been
able
to
observe
saniel
she
would
have
seen
him
pale
to
such
a
degree
that
his
lips
were
as
white
as
his
cheeks
but
she
was
completely
absorbed
in
what
she
was
saying
servant
conducted
us
to
madame
dammauville
whom
i
found
in
a
small
bed
near
a
window
and
the
concierge
told
her
who
i
was
she
received
me
kindly
and
after
having
made
me
sit
down
in
front
of
her
she
told
me
that
hearing
from
her
concierge
that
i
was
exerting
myself
in
my
behalf
she
had
something
to
tell
me
which
would
demonstrate
that
assassin
was
not
the
man
whom
the
law
had
arrested
and
detained
the
evening
of
the
assassination
she
was
in
this
same
room
lying
on
this
same
bed
before
this
same
window
and
after
having
read
all
day
she
reflected
and
dreamed
about
her
book
while
listlessly
watching
the
coming
of
twilight
in
the
court
that
already
obscured
everything
in
its
shadow
mechanically
she
had
fixed
her
eyes
on
the
window
of
office
opposite
suddenly
she
saw
a
tall
man
whom
she
took
for
an
upholsterer
approach
the
window
and
try
to
draw
the
curtains
then
caffie
rose
and
taking
the
lamp
he
came
forward
in
such
a
way
that
the
light
fell
full
on
the
face
of
this
upholsterer
you
understand
do
you
not
murmured
saniel
saw
him
then
plainly
enough
to
remember
him
and
not
to
confound
him
with
another
tall
with
long
hair
a
curled
blond
beard
and
dressed
like
a
gentleman
not
like
a
poor
man
the
curtains
were
drawn
it
was
fifteen
or
twenty
minutes
after
five
and
it
was
at
this
same
moment
that
caffie
was
butchered
by
this
false
upholsterer
who
evidently
had
only
drawn
the
curtains
so
that
he
might
kill
caffie
in
security
and
not
imagining
that
some
one
should
see
him
doing
a
deed
that
denounced
him
as
the
assassin
as
surely
as
if
he
had
been
surprised
with
the
knife
in
his
hand
on
reading
the
description
of
florentin
in
the
newspapers
when
he
was
arrested
madame
dammauville
believed
the
criminal
was
found
a
tall
man
with
long
hair
and
curled
beard
there
are
some
points
of
resemblance
but
in
the
portrait
published
in
the
illustrated
paper
that
she
received
she
did
not
recognize
the
man
who
drew
the
curtains
and
she
is
certain
that
the
judge
is
deceived
you
see
that
florentin
is
saved
book
chapter
xxiv
hedging
as
he
did
not
reply
to
this
cry
of
triumph
she
looked
at
him
in
surprise
saw
his
face
pale
agitated
under
the
shock
evidently
of
a
violent
emotion
that
she
could
not
explain
to
herself
is
the
matter
she
asked
with
uneasiness
he
answered
almost
brutally
do
not
wish
to
weaken
my
hope
she
said
not
imagining
that
he
could
not
think
of
this
hope
and
of
florentin
this
was
a
path
to
lead
him
out
of
his
confusion
in
following
it
he
would
have
time
to
recover
himself
is
true
he
said
do
not
think
that
what
madame
dammauville
saw
proves
innocence
what
may
be
a
proof
for
madame
dammauville
for
you
and
for
me
be
one
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
saw
you
so
joyful
that
i
did
not
dare
to
interrupt
you
believe
that
this
testimony
is
without
value
she
murmured
feeling
crushed
do
not
say
that
we
must
reflect
weigh
the
pro
and
con
compass
the
situation
from
divers
points
of
view
that
is
what
i
try
to
do
which
is
the
cause
of
my
preoccupation
that
astonishes
that
it
crushes
me
i
let
myself
be
carried
need
not
be
crushed
or
carried
away
certainly
what
this
lady
told
you
forms
a
considerable
piece
of
it
not
any
doubt
but
in
order
that
the
testimony
she
gives
may
be
of
great
consequence
the
witness
must
be
worthy
of
you
believe
this
lady
could
have
invented
such
a
story
do
not
say
that
but
before
all
it
is
necessary
to
know
who
she
widow
of
an
widow
of
an
attorney
and
landowner
evidently
this
constitutes
a
social
status
that
merits
consideration
from
the
law
but
the
moral
state
what
is
it
you
say
that
she
is
paralyzed
has
been
so
a
little
more
than
a
what
paralysis
that
is
a
vague
word
for
us
others
there
are
paralyses
that
affect
the
sight
others
that
affect
the
mind
is
it
one
of
these
with
which
this
lady
is
afflicted
or
one
of
the
others
which
permitted
her
really
to
see
the
evening
of
the
assassination
that
which
she
relates
and
which
leaves
her
mental
faculties
in
a
sane
condition
before
everything
it
is
important
to
know
phillis
was
prostrated
had
not
thought
of
all
that
she
murmured
is
very
natural
that
you
had
not
but
i
am
a
doctor
and
while
you
talked
it
was
the
doctor
who
is
true
it
is
true
she
repeated
only
saw
your
place
i
should
have
seen
like
you
only
my
brother
and
i
should
have
been
carried
away
by
hope
but
i
am
not
in
your
place
it
is
by
your
voice
that
this
woman
speaks
whom
i
do
not
know
and
against
whom
i
must
be
on
my
guard
for
the
sole
reason
that
it
is
a
paralytic
who
has
told
this
she
could
not
restrain
the
tears
that
came
to
her
eyes
and
she
let
them
flow
silently
finding
nothing
to
reply
am
sorry
to
pain
you
he
said
saw
only
do
not
say
this
testimony
of
madame
dammauville
will
not
influence
the
judge
and
above
all
the
jury
but
i
must
warn
you
that
you
will
expose
yourself
to
a
terrible
deception
if
you
believe
that
her
testimony
alone
will
give
your
brother
liberty
it
is
not
on
a
testimony
of
this
kind
or
of
this
quality
that
the
law
decides
better
than
we
it
knows
to
what
illusions
people
can
lend
themselves
when
it
is
the
question
of
a
crime
that
absorbs
and
excites
the
public
curiosity
there
are
some
witnesses
who
with
the
best
faith
in
the
world
believe
they
have
seen
the
most
extraordinary
things
which
only
existed
in
their
imaginations
and
there
are
people
who
accuse
themselves
rather
than
say
he
heaped
words
on
words
as
if
in
trying
to
convince
phillis
he
might
hope
to
convince
himself
but
when
the
sound
of
his
words
faded
he
was
obliged
to
declare
to
himself
that
whatever
the
paralysis
of
this
woman
might
be
it
had
not
in
this
instance
produced
either
defect
of
sight
or
of
mind
she
had
seen
indeed
the
tall
man
with
long
hair
and
curled
beard
dressed
like
a
gentleman
who
was
not
florentin
when
she
related
the
story
of
the
lamp
and
the
curtain
cords
she
knew
what
she
was
saying
in
his
first
alarm
he
had
been
very
near
betraying
himself
without
doubt
he
should
have
told
himself
that
this
incident
of
the
curtains
might
prove
a
trap
but
all
passed
so
rapidly
that
he
never
imagined
that
exactly
at
the
moment
when
caffie
raised
the
lamp
to
give
him
light
there
was
a
woman
opposite
looking
at
him
and
who
saw
him
so
plainly
that
she
had
not
forgotten
him
he
thought
to
use
all
precautions
on
his
side
in
drawing
the
curtains
when
on
the
contrary
he
would
have
done
better
had
he
left
them
undrawn
without
doubt
the
widow
of
the
attorney
would
have
been
a
witness
of
a
part
of
the
scene
but
in
the
shadow
she
would
not
have
distinguished
his
features
as
she
was
able
to
do
when
he
placed
himself
before
the
window
under
the
light
but
this
idea
did
not
enter
his
mind
and
to
save
himself
from
an
immediate
danger
he
threw
himself
into
another
which
although
uncertain
was
not
less
grave
little
by
little
phillis
recovered
herself
and
the
hope
that
madame
dammauville
put
in
her
heart
momentarily
crushed
by
remarks
sprang
up
again
it
not
possible
madame
dammauville
really
saw
what
she
relates
any
doubt
and
there
are
even
probabilities
that
it
is
so
since
the
man
who
drew
the
curtains
was
not
your
brother
as
we
know
unfortunately
it
is
not
ourselves
who
must
be
convinced
since
we
are
convinced
in
advance
it
is
those
who
in
advance
also
have
one
whom
they
will
not
give
up
unless
he
is
torn
from
them
by
if
madame
dammauville
saw
clearly
must
be
learned
before
everything
is
if
she
is
in
a
state
to
see
clearly
i
have
said
nothing
doctor
would
surely
know
on
examining
her
you
were
this
doctor
it
was
a
cry
rather
than
an
exclamation
she
wished
that
he
should
present
himself
before
this
woman
but
in
that
case
she
would
recognize
him
once
more
under
the
pain
of
betraying
his
emotion
he
must
recover
from
this
first
impulse
how
can
you
wish
me
to
go
and
examine
this
woman
whom
i
do
not
know
and
who
does
not
know
me
you
know
very
well
that
patients
choose
their
doctors
and
not
doctors
their
she
sent
for
you
what
right
what
i
shall
learn
on
making
the
concierge
talk
could
you
not
recognize
her
kind
of
paralysis
without
seeing
her
would
be
a
little
vague
however
i
will
do
the
best
i
can
try
to
learn
not
only
what
concerns
her
illness
but
all
that
relates
to
her
what
her
position
is
who
are
her
relations
which
is
important
for
a
witness
who
overawes
as
much
by
what
he
is
as
by
what
he
says
you
understand
that
a
deposition
that
destroys
the
whole
plan
of
the
prosecution
will
be
severely
disputed
and
will
only
be
accepted
if
madame
dammauville
has
by
her
character
and
position
a
sufficient
authority
to
break
down
all
will
also
try
to
learn
who
is
her
doctor
you
may
know
him
what
he
would
tell
you
would
be
worth
more
than
all
the
details
that
i
could
bring
should
be
immediately
decided
on
the
paralysis
and
we
should
see
what
credit
we
could
accord
this
while
listening
to
phillis
and
talking
himself
he
had
time
to
compass
the
situation
that
this
thunderbolt
created
for
him
evidently
the
first
thing
to
do
was
to
prevent
a
suspicion
from
arising
in
mind
and
it
was
to
this
that
he
applied
himself
on
explaining
the
different
kinds
of
paralysis
he
knew
her
well
enough
to
know
that
he
had
succeeded
but
what
would
she
do
now
how
did
she
mean
to
make
use
of
madame
declaration
had
she
spoken
of
it
to
any
one
besides
himself
was
it
her
intention
to
go
to
nougarede
and
tell
him
what
she
had
learned
all
that
must
be
made
clear
and
as
soon
as
possible
she
must
do
nothing
without
his
knowledge
and
approval
the
circumstances
were
critical
enough
without
his
letting
accident
become
the
master
to
direct
them
and
conduct
them
blindly
did
you
see
madame
dammauville
he
asked
this
now
what
do
you
wish
to
do
think
that
i
ought
to
tell
monsieur
whatever
the
value
of
madame
declaration
he
should
know
it
he
will
appraise
it
only
as
it
is
well
to
explain
to
him
what
may
vitiate
this
testimony
if
you
wish
i
will
go
to
see
i
wish
it
and
i
thank
the
mean
time
return
to
your
mother
and
tell
her
what
you
have
learned
but
that
she
may
not
yield
to
an
exaggerated
hope
tell
her
also
that
if
there
are
chances
and
great
ones
in
favor
of
your
brother
on
the
other
side
there
are
some
that
are
unfavorable
tomorrow
or
this
evening
you
will
return
to
the
rue
and
begin
your
inquiries
of
the
concierge
if
the
old
woman
tells
you
nothing
interesting
you
must
go
to
madame
dammauville
and
make
some
reason
for
seeing
her
make
her
talk
and
you
will
notice
if
her
ideas
are
consecutive
and
examine
her
face
and
eyes
above
all
neglect
nothing
that
appears
to
you
characteristic
having
taken
care
of
your
mother
you
know
almost
as
well
as
a
doctor
the
symptoms
of
myelitis
and
you
could
see
instantly
if
madame
dammauville
has
i
dared
she
said
timidly
after
a
short
hesitation
would
ask
you
to
come
with
me
to
the
concierge
think
of
such
a
thing
he
exclaimed
since
the
evening
when
he
had
testified
to
the
death
of
caffie
he
had
not
returned
to
the
rue
and
it
was
not
when
the
description
given
by
madame
dammauville
was
doubtless
already
spread
in
the
quarter
that
he
was
going
to
commit
the
imprudence
of
showing
himself
but
he
must
explain
this
exclamation
can
you
expect
a
doctor
to
give
himself
up
to
such
an
investigation
on
your
part
it
is
quite
natural
on
mine
it
would
be
unheard
of
and
ridiculous
add
that
it
would
be
dangerous
you
must
conciliate
madame
dammauville
and
this
would
be
truly
a
stupidity
that
would
give
her
a
pretext
for
thinking
that
you
are
trying
to
find
out
whether
she
is
or
is
not
in
her
right
is
true
she
said
had
not
thought
of
that
i
said
to
myself
that
while
i
could
only
listen
to
what
the
concierge
would
tell
me
you
would
know
how
to
question
her
in
a
way
that
would
lead
her
to
say
what
you
want
to
hope
that
your
investigation
will
tell
me
in
any
case
let
us
offend
in
nothing
if
you
bring
me
only
insignificant
details
we
will
consider
what
to
do
in
the
mean
time
return
to
the
concierge
this
evening
and
question
her
if
it
is
possible
see
madame
dammauville
and
do
not
go
home
until
after
having
obtained
some
news
on
this
subject
that
is
of
such
importance
to
us
and
i
will
go
to
see
chapter
xxv
dangerous
details
it
was
not
to
falsify
story
that
saniel
insisted
on
going
to
see
nougarede
what
good
would
it
do
that
would
be
a
blunder
which
sooner
or
later
would
show
itself
and
in
that
case
would
turn
against
him
he
would
have
liked
with
the
authority
of
a
physician
to
explain
that
this
testimony
of
a
paralytic
could
have
no
more
importance
than
that
of
a
crazy
woman
but
at
the
first
words
of
an
explanation
nougarede
stopped
him
you
say
is
very
possible
my
dear
friend
but
i
shall
make
you
see
that
it
is
not
for
us
to
raise
objections
of
this
kind
here
is
a
testimony
that
may
save
our
client
let
us
accept
this
such
as
it
may
be
whence
it
comes
it
is
the
business
of
the
prosecution
to
prove
that
our
witness
could
not
see
what
she
relates
that
she
saw
or
that
her
mental
condition
does
not
permit
her
to
know
what
she
saw
and
do
not
be
afraid
investigation
will
not
be
lacking
do
not
let
us
even
give
a
hint
from
our
side
that
would
be
this
certainly
was
not
what
saniel
wished
only
he
believed
it
a
duty
in
his
quality
of
physician
to
indicate
some
rocks
against
which
they
might
strike
themselves
duty
continued
the
advocate
therefore
to
manage
in
a
way
to
escape
them
and
this
is
how
i
understand
the
role
of
this
really
providential
witness
if
it
is
possible
to
make
her
undertake
it
since
it
has
occurred
to
you
you
who
wish
the
acquittal
of
this
poor
boy
that
the
testimony
of
madame
dammauville
may
be
vitiated
by
the
simple
fact
that
it
comes
from
a
sick
woman
it
is
incontestable
is
it
not
that
this
same
idea
will
occur
to
those
who
wish
for
his
conviction
this
testimony
should
be
irrefutable
it
should
be
presented
in
such
a
way
that
no
one
could
raise
anything
against
it
so
that
it
would
compel
the
acquittal
in
the
same
moment
that
it
is
presented
it
was
between
a
quarter
past
and
half
past
five
that
caffie
was
assassinated
at
exactly
a
quarter
past
five
a
woman
of
respectable
position
and
whose
intellectual
as
well
as
physical
faculties
render
her
worthy
of
being
believed
saw
in
caffies
office
a
man
with
whom
it
is
materially
impossible
to
confound
florentin
cormier
draw
the
curtains
of
the
window
and
thus
prepare
for
the
crime
she
would
make
her
deposition
in
these
conditions
and
in
these
terms
and
the
affair
would
be
finished
there
would
not
be
a
judge
after
this
confrontation
who
would
send
florentin
cormier
before
the
assizes
and
assuredly
there
would
not
be
two
voices
in
the
jury
for
conviction
but
things
will
not
happen
like
this
without
doubt
madame
dammauville
bears
a
name
that
is
worth
something
her
husband
was
an
estimable
attorney
a
brother
of
the
one
who
was
notary
at
you
ever
had
any
business
with
her
i
tell
you
what
is
well
known
to
every
one
morally
she
is
irreproachable
but
is
she
the
same
physically
and
mentally
not
at
all
unfortunately
if
a
physician
can
be
found
who
will
declare
that
her
paralysis
does
not
give
her
aberrations
or
hallucinations
another
one
will
be
found
who
will
contest
these
opinions
and
who
will
come
to
an
opposite
conclusion
so
much
for
the
witness
herself
now
for
the
testimony
this
testimony
does
not
say
that
the
man
who
drew
the
curtains
at
a
quarter
past
five
was
built
in
such
a
way
that
it
is
materially
impossible
to
confound
him
with
florentin
cormier
because
he
was
small
or
hunchbacked
or
bald
or
dressed
like
a
workman
while
florentin
is
tall
straight
with
long
hair
and
beard
and
dressed
like
a
gentleman
it
says
simply
that
the
man
who
drew
the
curtains
was
tall
with
long
hair
and
curled
blond
beard
and
dressed
like
a
gentleman
but
this
description
is
exactly
florentin
as
it
is
yours
saniel
exclaimed
as
well
as
that
of
many
others
and
it
is
this
unfortunately
for
us
which
destroys
the
irrefutability
that
we
must
have
how
is
it
certain
that
this
tall
man
with
long
hair
and
curled
beard
is
not
florentin
cormier
since
these
are
his
chief
characteristics
and
it
was
at
night
at
a
distance
of
twelve
or
fifteen
metres
through
a
window
whose
panes
were
obscured
by
the
dust
of
papers
and
the
mist
that
this
sick
woman
whose
eyes
are
affected
whose
mind
is
weakened
by
suffering
was
able
in
a
very
short
space
of
time
when
she
had
no
interest
to
imprint
upon
her
memory
what
she
saw
to
grasp
certain
signs
that
she
recalled
yesterday
strongly
enough
to
declare
that
the
man
who
drew
the
curtains
was
not
florentin
cormier
against
whom
so
many
charges
have
accumulated
from
various
sides
and
who
has
only
this
testimony
in
his
favor
every
sensible
person
could
not
but
find
it
suspicious
it
is
true
saniel
said
happy
to
lend
himself
to
this
view
of
the
matter
which
was
his
own
makes
the
truth
of
a
thing
my
dear
sir
is
the
way
of
presenting
it
let
us
change
this
manner
and
we
falsify
it
to
arrive
at
the
conclusion
which
made
you
say
is
true
i
am
on
the
side
of
the
idea
that
madame
story
should
be
known
to
the
law
that
the
brave
lady
should
be
heard
before
the
prosecution
and
that
time
should
be
allowed
to
examine
this
testimony
that
you
suspect
now
let
us
look
at
it
from
the
opposite
point
madame
story
is
not
known
to
the
law
or
if
something
transpires
we
will
arrange
that
this
something
is
so
vague
that
the
prosecution
will
attach
but
little
importance
to
it
and
this
is
possible
if
we
do
not
base
a
new
defence
on
this
testimony
we
arrive
at
the
judgment
and
when
the
prosecution
has
listened
to
its
witnesses
which
have
overwhelmed
us
the
agent
of
affairs
savoureux
the
tailor
valerius
it
is
madame
turn
she
simply
relates
what
she
saw
and
declares
that
the
man
who
is
on
the
bench
is
not
the
same
who
drew
the
curtains
at
a
quarter
past
five
do
you
see
the
de
the
prosecution
had
not
foreseen
it
it
had
not
inquired
into
the
health
of
the
witness
the
physician
would
not
be
there
to
quote
the
defects
of
sight
or
reason
very
probably
it
would
not
think
of
the
dusty
windowpanes
or
of
the
distance
and
all
the
opposing
arguments
that
would
be
properly
arranged
if
there
were
time
would
be
lacking
and
we
should
carry
the
acquittal
with
a
high
arranged
thus
things
were
too
favorable
for
saniel
for
him
not
to
receive
with
a
sentiment
of
relief
this
combination
which
brought
acquittal
more
surely
it
seemed
to
him
than
all
that
they
had
arranged
for
his
defence
up
to
this
day
however
an
objection
occurred
to
him
which
he
communicated
to
nougarede
immediately
one
wish
to
admit
that
madame
dammauville
had
kept
silent
on
so
grave
a
matter
and
waited
for
an
audience
to
reveal
it
silence
she
kept
until
yesterday
why
should
she
not
keep
it
a
few
days
longer
it
is
evident
that
if
she
had
not
related
what
she
saw
it
is
because
she
had
reasons
for
being
silent
it
is
probable
that
being
ill
she
did
not
wish
to
expose
herself
to
the
annoyances
and
fatigue
of
an
investigation
and
in
her
eyes
her
deposition
was
not
of
great
importance
what
should
she
have
revealed
to
the
prosecution
that
the
man
who
committed
the
crime
was
tall
with
a
curled
blond
beard
this
man
the
law
held
or
it
held
one
the
description
of
whom
answered
to
this
which
to
madame
dammauville
was
the
same
thing
she
did
not
need
therefore
to
call
the
police
or
the
judge
to
tell
them
these
insignificant
things
for
her
own
comfort
and
also
because
she
believed
that
she
had
nothing
interesting
to
say
she
did
not
speak
it
was
when
accident
brought
to
her
notice
the
portrait
of
the
accused
she
recognized
that
the
law
had
not
the
real
criminal
and
then
she
broke
the
silence
the
moment
when
she
first
saw
this
portrait
is
not
stated
precisely
i
undertake
to
arrange
that
the
difficulty
is
not
do
you
see
it
madame
dammauville
may
have
already
told
her
story
to
so
many
persons
that
it
is
already
public
property
where
the
prosecution
has
picked
it
up
in
that
case
there
will
be
no
de
she
will
be
questioned
her
deposition
examined
and
we
will
have
only
a
suspected
testimony
the
first
thing
to
do
then
is
to
know
how
far
this
story
has
spread
and
if
there
is
yet
time
to
prevent
it
from
spreading
is
not
easy
it
seems
to
believe
mademoiselle
phillis
can
do
it
she
is
a
brave
woman
whom
nothing
dejects
or
disconcerts
which
is
the
living
proof
that
we
are
only
valued
according
to
the
force
and
versatility
of
the
inner
consciousness
for
the
rest
i
need
not
sound
her
praises
since
you
know
her
better
than
i
and
what
i
say
has
no
other
object
but
to
explain
the
confidence
that
i
place
in
her
as
i
can
not
interfere
myself
i
think
there
is
no
better
person
than
she
to
act
on
madame
dammauville
without
disturbing
or
wounding
her
and
to
bring
about
the
result
that
we
desire
i
am
sure
that
she
has
already
won
madame
dammauville
and
that
she
will
be
listened
to
with
you
wish
me
to
write
to
her
to
come
to
see
you
tomorrow
it
would
be
better
for
you
so
see
her
this
evening
if
shall
go
to
the
batignolles
when
i
leave
will
enter
into
her
part
perfectly
i
am
certain
and
she
will
succeed
i
seems
to
me
that
your
combination
rests
above
all
on
the
de
of
the
of
florentin
by
madame
dammauville
how
will
you
bring
this
paralytic
to
court
depend
upon
how
will
examine
shall
have
to
go
to
her
house
not
i
am
not
her
will
become
is
do
not
find
it
at
all
impossible
that
you
should
be
called
in
consultation
i
have
not
forgotten
that
your
thesis
was
on
the
paralyses
due
to
the
affection
of
the
spinal
cord
and
it
was
remarkable
enough
for
us
to
discuss
it
in
our
of
the
rue
de
vaugirard
you
have
therefore
authority
in
the
is
not
on
account
of
having
written
several
works
on
the
pathological
anatomy
of
medullary
lesions
and
especially
on
the
alterations
of
the
spinal
ganglia
that
one
acquires
authority
in
a
question
so
comprehensive
and
so
not
be
too
modest
dear
friend
i
have
had
lately
to
consult
my
dictionary
of
medicine
and
at
each
page
your
work
was
quoted
and
besides
the
way
in
which
you
passed
your
examinations
made
you
famous
every
one
talks
of
you
so
it
is
not
impossible
that
mademoiselle
phillis
relating
that
her
mother
was
cured
of
a
similar
paralysis
will
give
madame
dammauville
the
idea
of
consulting
you
and
her
physician
will
send
for
will
not
do
that
why
should
i
not
do
it
they
looked
at
each
other
a
moment
in
silence
and
saniel
turned
his
eyes
away
detest
nothing
so
much
as
to
appear
to
put
myself
this
case
it
is
no
matter
what
you
detest
or
like
the
question
is
to
save
this
unfortunate
young
man
whom
you
know
to
be
innocent
and
you
can
do
a
kind
deed
and
aid
us
you
examine
madame
dammauville
you
see
with
which
paralysis
she
is
afflicted
and
consequently
what
exceptions
may
be
taken
at
her
testimony
at
the
same
time
you
see
if
you
can
cure
her
or
at
least
put
her
in
a
state
to
go
to
if
it
is
proved
that
she
can
not
leave
her
bed
that
case
i
shall
change
my
order
of
battle
and
that
is
why
it
is
of
capital
importance
you
know
that
that
is
the
word
that
we
should
be
warned
will
make
the
judge
receive
her
deposition
any
case
but
i
shall
make
her
write
a
letter
that
i
shall
read
at
the
desired
moment
and
i
shall
call
upon
her
physician
to
explain
that
he
would
not
permit
his
patient
to
come
to
court
without
doubt
the
effect
would
not
be
what
i
desire
but
anyhow
we
should
have
chapter
xxvi
a
good
memory
after
phillis
nougarde
also
wished
him
to
see
madame
dammauville
this
coincidence
was
not
the
least
danger
of
the
situation
that
opened
before
him
if
he
saw
her
the
chances
were
that
she
would
recognize
in
him
the
man
who
drew
the
curtains
for
if
he
was
able
to
speak
to
phillis
and
nougarede
of
an
affection
of
the
eyes
or
of
the
mind
he
did
not
believe
in
these
affections
which
for
him
were
only
makeshifts
when
he
reached
madame
phillis
had
not
returned
and
he
was
obliged
to
explain
to
the
uneasy
mother
why
her
daughter
was
late
it
was
a
delirium
of
joy
before
which
he
felt
embarrassed
how
should
he
break
the
hope
of
this
unhappy
mother
what
he
had
said
to
phillis
and
to
nougarede
he
repeated
to
her
it
is
possible
also
for
paralytics
to
enjoy
all
their
faculties
madame
cormier
said
with
a
decision
that
was
not
in
accordance
with
her
habit
or
with
her
character
i
not
an
example
florentin
will
be
is
what
we
hope
i
only
caution
you
against
an
excess
of
joy
by
an
excess
of
prudence
nevertheless
it
is
probable
mademoiselle
phillis
will
settle
this
for
us
when
she
it
would
have
been
better
if
you
had
gone
to
the
rue
you
would
have
found
there
was
then
a
universal
mania
to
send
him
to
the
rue
they
waited
but
the
conversation
was
difficult
and
slow
between
them
it
was
neither
of
phillis
nor
of
florentin
that
saniel
thought
it
was
of
himself
and
of
his
own
fears
while
madame
thoughts
ran
to
phillis
then
there
were
long
silences
that
madame
cormier
interrupted
by
going
to
the
kitchen
to
look
after
her
dinner
that
had
been
ready
since
two
not
knowing
what
to
say
or
do
in
the
presence
of
sombre
face
and
preoccupation
which
she
could
not
explain
she
asked
him
if
he
had
dined
you
will
accept
a
plate
of
soup
i
have
some
of
bouillon
that
phillis
did
not
find
but
he
did
not
accept
which
hurt
madame
cormier
for
a
long
time
saniel
had
been
a
sort
of
god
to
her
and
since
he
had
shown
so
much
zeal
regarding
florentin
the
was
become
more
fervent
at
last
step
was
heard
you
came
to
tell
mamma
she
exclaimed
on
seeing
saniel
ordinarily
her
mother
listened
to
her
respectfully
but
now
she
interrupted
her
madame
dammauville
she
asked
dammauville
has
excellent
eyes
she
is
a
woman
of
intellect
who
without
the
assistance
of
any
business
man
manages
her
overcome
madame
cormier
fell
into
a
chair
the
poor
child
she
murmured
exclamations
of
joy
escaped
her
which
contained
but
little
sense
is
as
i
thought
saniel
said
it
would
be
imprudent
to
abandon
ourselves
to
hopes
that
may
while
he
spoke
he
escaped
at
least
from
the
embarrassment
of
his
position
and
from
the
examination
of
phillis
did
monsieur
nougarde
say
she
asked
will
explain
to
you
presently
begin
by
telling
us
what
you
learned
from
madame
dammauville
it
is
her
condition
that
will
decide
our
course
at
least
that
which
nougarde
counsels
us
to
the
concierge
saw
me
return
phillis
began
showed
a
certain
surprise
but
she
is
a
good
woman
who
is
easily
tamed
and
i
had
not
much
trouble
in
making
her
tell
me
all
she
knows
of
madame
dammauville
three
years
ago
madame
dammauville
became
a
widow
without
children
she
is
about
forty
years
of
age
and
since
her
widowhood
has
lived
in
her
house
in
the
rue
until
last
year
she
was
not
ill
but
she
went
every
year
to
the
springs
at
lamoulon
it
is
a
year
since
she
was
taken
with
pains
that
were
thought
to
be
rheumatic
following
which
paralysis
attacked
her
and
confined
her
to
her
bed
she
suffers
so
much
sometimes
that
she
cries
but
these
are
spasms
that
do
not
last
in
the
intervals
she
lives
the
ordinary
life
except
that
she
does
not
get
up
she
reads
a
great
deal
receives
her
friends
her
widow
of
a
notary
her
nephews
and
nieces
and
one
of
the
vicars
of
the
parish
for
she
is
very
charitable
her
eyes
are
excellent
she
has
never
had
delirium
or
hallucinations
she
is
very
reserved
detests
gossip
and
above
everything
seeks
to
live
quietly
the
assassination
of
caffie
exasperated
her
she
would
let
no
one
speak
to
her
of
him
and
she
spoke
of
it
to
no
one
she
even
said
that
if
she
were
in
a
condition
to
leave
her
house
she
would
sell
it
so
that
she
would
never
hear
the
name
of
did
she
speak
of
the
portrait
and
of
the
man
she
saw
in
office
saniel
asked
is
exactly
the
question
that
the
concierge
was
not
able
to
answer
so
i
decided
to
go
to
see
madame
dammauville
are
courageous
the
mother
said
with
pride
assure
you
that
i
was
not
so
on
going
after
what
i
had
heard
of
her
character
it
was
truly
audacious
to
go
a
second
time
after
an
interval
of
two
hours
to
trouble
her
but
it
was
necessary
while
ascending
i
sought
a
reason
to
justify
or
at
least
to
explain
my
second
visit
and
i
found
only
an
adventurous
one
for
which
i
ought
to
ask
your
she
said
this
on
turning
toward
saniel
but
with
lowered
eyes
without
daring
to
look
at
him
and
with
an
emotion
that
made
him
uneasy
indulgence
he
said
acted
without
having
time
to
reflect
and
under
the
pressure
of
immediate
need
as
madame
dammauville
expressed
surprise
at
seeing
me
again
i
told
her
that
what
she
had
said
to
me
was
so
serious
and
might
have
such
consequences
for
the
life
and
honor
of
my
brother
that
i
had
thought
of
returning
the
next
day
accompanied
by
a
person
familiar
with
the
affair
before
whom
she
would
repeat
her
story
and
that
i
came
to
ask
her
permission
to
present
this
person
this
person
is
that
is
why
she
said
feebly
without
raising
her
eyes
i
have
need
of
your
i
had
told
you
he
exclaimed
with
a
violence
that
the
dissatisfaction
at
being
so
disposed
of
was
not
sufficient
to
justify
you
could
not
present
yourself
to
madame
dammauville
in
the
character
of
a
physician
unless
she
sent
for
you
i
did
not
forget
that
and
it
is
not
as
a
physician
that
i
wish
to
beg
you
to
accompany
me
but
as
a
friend
if
you
permit
me
to
speak
thus
as
the
most
devoted
the
most
firm
and
the
most
generous
friend
that
we
have
had
the
happiness
to
encounter
in
our
daughter
speaks
in
my
name
as
in
her
own
madame
cormier
said
with
emotion
add
that
it
is
a
respectful
friendship
a
profound
gratitude
that
we
feel
toward
although
phillis
trembled
to
see
the
effect
that
she
produced
on
saniel
she
continued
with
firmness
would
accompany
me
then
without
doing
anything
ostensibly
without
saying
you
are
a
doctor
and
while
she
talks
you
could
examine
her
madame
dammauville
gave
her
consent
to
my
request
with
extreme
kindness
i
shall
return
to
her
and
if
you
think
it
useful
if
you
think
you
should
accept
the
part
that
i
claimed
for
you
without
consulting
you
you
can
accompany
he
did
not
reply
to
these
last
words
which
were
an
invitation
as
well
as
a
question
you
not
examine
her
as
i
told
you
he
asked
after
a
moment
of
reflection
all
the
attention
of
which
i
was
capable
in
my
anguish
her
glance
seemed
to
me
straight
and
untroubled
her
voice
is
regular
very
rhythmical
her
words
follow
each
other
without
hesitation
her
ideas
are
consecutive
and
clearly
expressed
there
is
no
trace
of
suffering
on
her
pale
face
which
bears
only
the
mark
of
a
resigned
grief
she
moves
her
arms
freely
but
the
legs
so
far
as
i
could
judge
under
the
bedclothes
are
motionless
in
many
ways
it
seems
to
me
that
her
paralysis
resembles
though
it
is
true
that
in
others
it
does
not
she
must
be
extremely
sensitive
to
the
cold
for
although
the
weather
is
not
cold
today
the
temperature
of
her
room
seemed
very
is
an
examination
saniel
said
a
physician
could
not
have
conducted
better
unless
he
questioned
the
patient
and
had
i
been
with
you
during
this
visit
we
should
not
have
learned
anything
more
it
appears
certain
that
madame
dammauville
is
in
possession
of
her
faculties
which
renders
her
testimony
madame
cormier
drew
her
daughter
to
her
and
kissed
her
passionately
have
therefore
nothing
to
do
with
this
lady
continued
saniel
with
the
precipitation
of
a
man
who
has
just
escaped
a
danger
your
part
mademoiselle
is
not
finished
and
you
must
return
to
her
tomorrow
to
fulfil
that
which
nougarde
confides
to
he
explained
what
nougarde
expected
of
her
she
said
will
do
all
that
i
am
advised
to
do
for
florentin
i
will
go
to
madame
dammauville
i
will
go
everywhere
but
will
you
permit
me
to
express
my
astonishment
that
immediate
profit
is
not
made
of
this
declaration
to
obtain
the
release
of
my
brother
he
repeated
the
reasons
that
nougarede
had
given
him
for
not
proceeding
in
this
manner
would
not
say
anything
that
resembles
a
reproach
said
madame
cormier
with
more
decision
than
she
ordinarily
put
into
her
words
perhaps
monsieur
nougarde
has
some
personal
ideas
in
his
advice
our
interest
is
that
florentin
should
return
to
us
as
quickly
as
possible
and
that
he
should
be
spared
the
sufferings
of
a
prison
but
i
understand
that
to
an
de
in
which
he
does
not
appear
monsieur
nougarde
prefers
the
broad
light
of
the
court
where
he
could
deliver
a
brilliant
address
useful
to
his
or
not
he
has
made
this
calculation
saniel
said
are
thus
i
also
i
should
have
preferred
the
de
which
has
the
great
advantage
of
finishing
everything
immediately
nougarede
does
not
believe
that
this
would
be
a
good
plan
to
follow
so
we
must
follow
the
one
that
he
traces
out
for
will
follow
it
phillis
said
i
believe
that
it
may
bring
about
the
result
monsieur
nougarede
expects
as
madame
dammauville
would
have
spoken
to
but
few
persons
when
i
tried
to
make
her
explain
herself
on
this
point
without
asking
her
the
question
directly
she
told
me
that
she
had
only
spoken
to
the
concierge
of
the
of
the
portrait
to
the
man
she
saw
draw
the
curtains
so
that
the
concierge
who
had
often
spoken
to
her
of
florentin
and
of
my
efforts
to
save
him
might
warn
me
i
shall
see
then
how
far
her
story
has
spread
and
i
will
go
to
see
you
about
it
at
five
unless
you
prefer
that
i
should

not

the

attends
her

you

him
prig
who
conceals
his
ignorance
under
dignified
no
sooner
had
these
words
left
his
lips
than
he
realized
his
error
madame
dammauville
should
have
an
excellent
physician
one
who
was
so
high
in
the
estimation
of
his
that
if
he
did
not
cure
her
it
was
because
she
was
incurable
how
can
you
hope
that
he
will
cure
her
in
time
for
her
to
go
to
court
phillis
asked
he
did
not
answer
and
rose
to
go
timidly
madame
cormier
repeated
her
invitation
but
he
did
not
accept
it
in
spite
of
the
tender
glance
that
phillis
gave
him
chapter
xxvii
a
new
peril
would
he
be
able
to
resist
the
pressure
which
from
all
sides
at
once
pushed
him
toward
the
rue
sainte
anne
it
seemed
that
nothing
was
easier
than
not
to
commit
the
folly
of
yielding
and
yet
such
was
the
persistence
of
the
efforts
that
were
united
against
him
that
he
asked
himself
if
one
day
he
would
not
be
led
to
obey
them
in
spite
of
himself
phillis
nougarede
madame
cormier
now
whence
would
come
a
new
attack
for
several
months
he
had
enjoyed
a
complete
security
which
convinced
him
that
all
danger
was
over
forever
but
all
at
once
this
danger
burst
forth
under
such
conditions
that
he
must
recognize
that
there
could
never
more
be
any
security
for
him
madame
dammauville
menaced
him
tomorrow
it
would
be
some
one
else
who
he
did
not
know
every
one
and
it
was
the
anguish
of
his
position
to
be
condemned
to
live
hereafter
in
fear
and
on
the
defensive
without
repose
without
forgetfulness
but
it
was
not
tomorrow
about
which
he
need
be
uneasy
at
this
moment
it
was
the
present
hour
that
is
to
say
madame
dammauville
that
she
should
say
with
so
much
firmness
at
the
sight
of
a
single
portrait
that
the
man
who
drew
the
curtains
was
not
florentin
she
must
have
an
excellent
memory
of
the
eyes
at
the
same
time
a
resolute
mind
and
a
decision
in
her
ideas
which
permitted
her
to
affirm
without
hesitation
what
she
believed
to
be
true
if
they
should
ever
meet
she
would
recognize
him
and
recognizing
him
she
would
speak
would
she
be
believed
this
was
the
decisive
question
and
from
what
he
had
heard
of
her
it
seemed
that
she
would
be
denials
would
not
suffice
he
did
not
go
to
at
a
quarter
past
five
where
was
he
at
this
moment
what
witness
could
he
call
upon
wound
was
made
by
a
hand
skilled
in
killing
and
this
learned
hand
was
his
more
even
than
that
of
a
murderer
every
one
knew
that
his
position
at
that
moment
was
desperate
financially
speaking
and
suddenly
he
paid
his
debts
who
would
believe
the
monte
carlo
story
one
word
one
little
hint
from
this
madame
dammauville
and
he
was
lost
without
defence
without
possible
struggles
truly
and
fortunately
since
she
was
paralyzed
and
confined
to
her
bed
he
ran
no
risk
of
meeting
her
face
to
face
at
the
corner
of
a
street
or
at
the
house
of
an
acquaintance
nor
of
hearing
the
cry
of
surprise
that
she
would
not
fail
to
give
on
recognizing
him
but
that
was
not
enough
to
make
him
sleep
in
an
imprudent
security
on
saying
to
himself
that
this
meeting
was
improbable
it
was
improbable
also
to
admit
that
some
one
was
exactly
opposite
to
caffies
window
at
the
moment
when
he
drew
the
curtains
more
improbable
yet
to
believe
that
this
fact
insignificant
in
itself
that
this
vision
lasting
only
an
instant
would
be
so
solidly
engraved
in
a
memory
as
to
be
distinctly
remembered
after
several
months
as
if
it
dated
from
the
previous
evening
and
yet
of
all
these
improbabilities
there
was
formed
a
reality
which
enclosed
him
in
such
a
way
that
at
any
moment
it
might
stifle
him
despite
the
importunities
of
phillis
madame
cormier
and
nougarede
and
of
all
those
which
might
arise
he
would
not
be
fool
enough
to
confront
the
danger
of
a
recognition
in
the
room
where
this
paralytic
was
confined
at
least
that
was
probable
for
after
what
had
happened
he
was
certain
of
nothing
but
this
recognition
might
take
place
elsewhere
in
plan
madame
dammauville
would
come
to
court
to
make
her
declaration
he
himself
was
a
witness
they
would
therefore
at
a
given
moment
meet
each
other
and
it
was
not
impossible
that
before
the
court
the
recognition
would
occur
with
a
de
very
different
from
that
arranged
by
nougarede
without
doubt
there
were
chances
that
madame
dammauville
would
not
be
able
to
leave
her
bed
to
go
to
court
but
were
there
only
one
for
her
leaving
it
he
must
foresee
it
and
take
precautions
a
single
one
offered
security
to
render
himself
unrecognizable
to
cut
his
beard
and
hair
to
be
no
more
the
curled
man
that
she
remembered
had
he
been
like
every
one
else
she
would
not
have
remarked
him
or
at
least
she
would
have
confounded
him
with
others
a
man
can
only
permit
himself
to
be
original
in
appearance
when
he
is
sure
beforehand
that
he
will
never
have
anything
to
fear
assuredly
nothing
was
easier
than
to
have
his
hair
and
beard
cut
he
had
only
to
enter
the
first
barber
shop
he
came
to
in
a
few
minutes
the
change
would
be
radical
among
his
acquaintances
he
need
not
be
uneasy
at
the
curiosity
that
this
change
might
produce
more
than
one
would
not
remark
it
and
those
who
would
be
surprised
at
first
would
soon
cease
to
think
of
it
without
doubt
otherwise
he
had
an
easy
answer
for
them
on
the
eve
of
becoming
a
serious
personage
he
abandoned
the
last
eccentricities
of
the
old
student
and
passed
the
bridge
without
wish
to
return
by
the
left
bank
but
it
was
not
only
to
acquaintances
that
he
must
account
there
were
phillis
and
nougarde
had
not
the
latter
already
remarked
the
resemblance
between
him
and
the
description
and
would
it
not
be
imprudent
to
lead
him
to
ask
why
this
resemblance
suddenly
disappeared
it
would
be
dangerous
to
expose
himself
to
this
question
from
the
lawyer
but
it
would
be
much
more
dangerous
coming
from
phillis
nougarede
would
only
show
surprise
phillis
might
ask
for
an
explanation
and
he
must
reply
to
her
so
much
the
more
clearly
because
four
or
five
times
already
he
had
almost
betrayed
himself
as
to
madame
dammauville
and
if
she
had
let
his
explanations
or
embarrassment
pass
his
hesitations
or
his
refusal
without
questioning
him
frankly
certainly
she
was
not
the
less
astonished
should
he
appear
before
her
with
short
hair
and
no
beard
it
would
be
a
new
astonishment
which
added
to
the
others
would
establish
suspicions
and
logically
by
the
force
of
things
in
spite
of
herself
in
spite
of
her
love
and
her
faith
she
would
arrive
at
conclusions
from
which
she
would
not
be
able
to
free
herself
already
five
or
six
months
before
this
question
of
long
hair
and
beard
had
been
agitated
between
them
as
he
complained
one
day
of
the
bourgeois
who
would
not
come
to
him
she
gently
explained
to
him
that
to
please
and
attract
these
bourgeois
it
was
perhaps
not
quite
well
to
astonish
those
whom
one
does
not
shock
that
overcoats
less
long
hats
with
less
brim
and
hair
and
beard
shorter
in
fact
a
general
appearance
that
more
nearly
approached
their
own
would
be
perhaps
more
agreeable
he
became
angry
and
replied
plainly
that
such
concessions
were
not
in
keeping
with
his
character
how
could
he
now
abruptly
make
these
concessions
and
at
a
time
when
his
success
at
the
examinations
placed
him
above
such
small
compromises
he
resisted
when
he
needed
help
and
when
a
patient
was
an
affair
of
life
or
death
to
him
he
yielded
when
he
had
need
of
no
one
and
when
he
did
not
care
for
patients
the
contradiction
was
truly
too
strong
and
such
that
it
could
not
but
strike
phillis
whose
attention
had
already
had
only
too
much
to
arouse
it
and
yet
as
dangerous
as
it
was
to
come
to
the
decision
to
make
himself
unrecognizable
it
would
be
madness
on
his
part
to
draw
back
the
sooner
the
better
his
fault
had
been
in
not
foreseeing
the
day
after
death
that
circumstances
might
arise
sooner
or
later
which
would
force
it
upon
him
at
that
moment
it
did
not
present
the
same
dangers
as
now
but
parting
from
the
idea
that
he
had
not
been
seen
by
any
one
that
he
could
not
have
been
seen
he
had
rejoiced
in
the
security
that
this
conviction
gave
him
and
quietly
become
benumbed
the
awakening
had
come
with
his
eyes
open
he
saw
the
abyss
to
the
edge
of
which
his
stupidity
had
brought
him
how
strong
would
he
not
be
if
during
the
last
three
months
he
had
not
had
this
long
hair
and
beard
which
was
most
terrible
testimony
against
him
instead
of
taking
refuge
in
miserable
makeshifts
when
phillis
and
nougarede
asked
him
to
see
madame
dammauville
he
would
have
boldly
held
his
own
and
have
gone
to
see
her
as
they
wished
in
that
case
he
would
be
saved
and
soon
florentin
would
be
also
and
he
believed
himself
intelligent
and
he
proudly
imagined
he
could
arrange
things
beforehand
so
well
that
he
would
never
be
surprised
what
he
should
have
foreseen
would
come
to
pass
nothing
more
the
lesson
that
experience
taught
him
was
hard
and
this
was
not
the
first
one
the
evening
of
death
he
saw
very
clearly
that
a
new
situation
opened
before
him
which
to
the
end
of
his
life
would
make
him
the
prisoner
of
his
crime
to
tell
the
truth
however
this
impression
became
faint
soon
enough
but
now
it
was
stronger
than
ever
and
to
a
certainty
never
to
be
dismissed
again
but
it
was
useless
to
look
behind
it
was
the
present
and
the
future
that
he
must
measure
with
a
clear
and
firm
glance
if
he
did
not
wish
to
be
lost
after
carefully
examining
and
weighing
the
question
he
decided
to
have
his
hair
and
beard
cut
however
adventurous
this
resolution
was
however
embarrassing
it
might
become
in
provoking
curiosity
and
questions
it
was
the
only
way
of
escaping
a
possible
recognition
mechanically
by
habit
he
bent
his
steps
toward
the
rue
where
his
barber
lived
but
he
had
taken
only
a
few
steps
when
reflection
caused
him
to
stop
it
would
be
certainly
a
mistake
to
provoke
the
gossip
of
this
man
who
knew
him
and
who
for
the
pleasure
of
talking
would
tell
every
one
in
the
quarter
that
he
had
just
cut
the
hair
and
beard
of
saniel
he
returned
to
the
boulevard
where
he
was
not
known
but
as
he
was
about
to
open
the
door
of
the
shop
which
he
decided
to
enter
he
changed
his
mind
he
happened
to
find
the
explanation
that
he
must
give
phillis
and
as
he
wished
to
avoid
the
surprise
that
she
would
not
fail
to
show
if
she
saw
him
suddenly
without
hair
and
beard
he
would
give
this
explanation
before
having
them
cut
in
such
a
way
that
all
at
once
and
without
looking
for
another
reason
she
would
understand
that
this
operation
was
indispensable
and
he
went
to
dinner
furious
with
himself
and
with
things
to
see
to
what
miserable
expedients
he
was
reduced

visits
a
barber
the
following
day
at
five
when
phillis
rang
he
opened
the
door
for
her
hardly
had
she
entered
when
she
was
about
to
throw
herself
into
his
arms
as
usual
with
a
quickness
that
told
how
happy
she
was
to
see
him
but
he
checked
her
with
his
hand
is
the
matter
she
asked
paralyzed
and
full
of
fears
or
at
least
nothing
me
not
dear
are
ill
not
ill
but
i
must
take
precautions
which
prevent
me
from
embracing
you
i
will
explain
do
not
be
uneasy
it
is
not
she
cried
examining
him
and
trying
to
anticipate
his
thought
have
something
to
tell
me
good
news
but
i
beg
of
you
speak
first
do
not
leave
me
in
assure
you
that
you
need
not
be
uneasy
and
when
i
speak
thus
you
know
that
you
should
believe
me
you
see
that
i
am
not
is
for
others
that
you
are
alarmed
never
for
you
know
what
the
pelagre
is
is
a
special
disease
of
the
hair
and
beard
due
to
the
presence
in
the
epidermis
of
a
kind
of
mushroom
well
it
is
probable
that
i
have
this
it
serious
for
a
man
but
disastrous
for
a
woman
because
before
any
treatment
the
hair
must
be
cut
you
understand
therefore
that
if
i
have
the
pelagre
as
i
believe
i
have
i
am
not
going
to
expose
you
to
the
risk
of
catching
it
in
embracing
you
it
is
very
easily
transmitted
and
in
that
case
you
would
be
obliged
probably
to
do
for
yourself
what
i
must
do
for
myself
that
is
to
cut
my
hair
with
me
it
is
of
no
consequence
but
with
you
it
would
be
murder
to
sacrifice
your
beautiful
say
i
am
not
yet
quite
certain
that
i
have
the
pelagre
for
about
two
weeks
i
have
felt
a
slight
itching
in
my
head
and
naturally
i
paid
no
attention
to
it
i
had
other
things
to
do
and
besides
i
was
not
going
to
believe
i
was
attacked
with
a
parasitic
malady
merely
on
account
of
an
itching
but
after
some
time
my
hair
became
dry
and
began
to
fall
out
i
had
no
time
to
attend
to
it
and
the
days
passed
besides
the
excitement
of
my
examinations
was
enough
to
make
my
hair
fall
just
before
you
came
i
had
a
few
minutes
to
spare
and
i
examined
one
of
my
hairs
through
a
microscope
if
i
had
not
been
disturbed
i
should
have
finished
by
this
your
would
take
some
time
to
do
it
thoroughly
if
it
is
really
the
pelagre
as
i
have
reason
to
believe
tomorrow
you
will
see
me
without
hair
and
beard
i
would
not
hesitate
in
spite
of
the
astonishment
that
my
appearance
would
good
will
that
do
can
not
tell
people
that
i
had
my
hair
and
beard
cut
because
i
have
a
parasitic
disease
every
one
knows
it
is
the
hair
is
cut
what
will
become
of
the
disease
energetic
treatment
it
will
rapidly
disappear
before
long
you
may
embrace
me
if
you
do
not
find
me
too
dearest
now
for
you
you
have
come
from
madame
dammauville
he
did
not
need
to
persist
phillis
accepted
his
story
so
readily
that
he
felt
reassured
on
her
side
she
would
not
alarm
herself
about
it
as
for
others
the
embarrassment
of
confessing
a
contagious
malady
would
be
a
sufficient
explanation
if
he
were
ever
obliged
to
furnish
one
did
she
say
to
you
he
asked
and
kind
words
to
begin
with
which
show
what
an
excellent
woman
she
is
after
having
presented
myself
twice
at
her
house
yesterday
you
understand
that
i
was
not
quite
easy
on
asking
her
to
receive
me
again
as
i
tried
to
excuse
myself
she
said
she
was
glad
to
see
my
devotion
to
my
brother
that
i
need
never
excuse
myself
for
asking
her
assistance
and
that
she
would
help
me
all
she
could
with
this
encouragement
i
explained
what
we
want
her
to
do
but
she
did
not
appear
disposed
to
do
it
without
giving
her
monsieur
reasons
i
said
we
were
obliged
to
conform
to
the
counsels
of
those
who
directed
the
affair
and
i
begged
her
to
help
us
finally
she
was
won
over
but
reluctantly
and
said
she
would
do
as
we
wished
but
she
could
not
assure
me
that
her
servants
had
not
talked
about
it
nor
could
she
promise
to
leave
her
bed
to
go
to
court
for
she
had
not
left
her
room
for
a
she
expect
to
be
able
to
rise
soon
repeat
her
words
to
which
i
paid
great
attention
in
order
not
to
forget
them
am
promised
that
i
shall
be
better
next
year
but
who
can
tell
i
will
urge
my
doctor
to
give
me
an
answer
and
when
you
come
again
i
will
tell
you
what
he
profiting
by
the
door
that
she
opened
to
me
i
kept
the
conversation
on
this
doctor
it
seems
to
me
but
i
am
not
certain
that
she
has
but
little
confidence
in
him
he
was
the
classmate
of
her
husband
and
of
her
the
notary
he
is
the
friend
of
every
one
curing
those
who
can
be
cured
or
letting
them
die
by
accident
you
see
what
kind
of
a
doctor
he
told
you
i
knew
if
i
deceive
myself
and
to
what
i
tell
you
add
what
you
already
know
frightened
to
see
in
whose
hands
she
is
i
undertook
to
find
out
and
finished
by
learning
without
asking
her
directly
that
she
has
seen
no
other
physician
during
the
year
when
she
was
taken
with
paralysis
a
consultation
was
held
and
she
has
had
doctor
balzajette
ever
since
she
says
he
is
very
kind
and
takes
care
of
her
as
well
as
another
saniel
improved
the
opportunity
to
refer
to
his
stupidity
in
frankly
expressing
his
opinion
on
the
solemn
balzajette
is
probable
he
said
is
certain
do
you
believe
that
during
one
year
nothing
has
appeared
in
madame
disease
that
should
demand
new
treatment
do
you
think
the
solemn
balzajette
is
incapable
of
finding
it
all
by
himself
is
not
so
dull
as
you
is
you
who
speak
of
diagnose
a
disease
and
to
treat
it
are
two
things
it
is
the
consultation
you
speak
of
that
settled
the
question
of
madame
disease
and
prescribed
the
treatment
that
balzajette
had
only
to
apply
and
his
capacity
i
assure
you
is
sufficient
for
this
as
she
appeared
but
little
reassured
he
persisted
for
it
would
be
an
imprudence
to
let
phillis
become
enamored
of
the
idea
that
if
he
attended
madame
dammauville
he
would
cure
her
even
if
it
required
a
miracle
have
some
time
before
us
since
the
de
before
the
assizes
is
not
yet
given
out
madame
dammauville
has
promised
to
question
her
doctor
to
learn
if
he
hopes
to
put
her
in
condition
to
leave
her
bed
soon
let
us
wait
it
not
be
better
to
act
than
to
wait
least
let
us
wait
for
news
from
balzajette
either
it
will
be
satisfactory
and
then
we
shall
have
nothing
to
do
or
it
will
not
be
and
in
that
case
i
promise
you
to
see
balzajette
i
know
him
well
enough
to
speak
to
him
of
your
patient
which
above
all
enables
me
in
making
your
brother
intervene
to
interest
myself
openly
in
his
dearest
dearest
she
murmured
in
a
spirit
of
gratitude
can
not
doubt
my
devotion
to
you
first
and
to
your
brother
afterward
you
asked
me
an
impossible
thing
that
i
was
obliged
to
refuse
to
my
regret
precisely
because
it
was
impossible
but
you
know
that
i
am
yours
and
will
do
all
i
can
for
your
have
nothing
to
forgive
in
your
place
i
should
think
as
you
do
but
i
believe
that
in
mine
you
would
act
as
i
sure
that
i
have
never
had
an
idea
of
blame
in
my
heart
for
what
is
with
you
an
affair
of
dignity
it
is
because
you
are
high
and
proud
that
i
love
you
so
she
rose
you
going
he
asked
want
to
carry
madame
words
to
mamma
you
can
imagine
with
what
anguish
she
awaits
us
go
i
will
leave
you
at
the
boulevard
to
go
to
see
the
interview
with
the
advocate
was
short
see
dear
friend
that
my
plan
is
good
bring
madame
dammauville
to
court
and
we
shall
have
some
pleasant
this
time
saniel
had
not
the
hesitation
of
the
previous
evening
and
he
entered
the
first
he
saw
when
he
returned
to
his
rooms
he
lighted
two
candles
and
placing
them
on
the
mantle
he
looked
at
himself
in
the
glass
coquetry
had
never
been
his
sin
and
often
weeks
passed
without
his
looking
in
a
mirror
so
indifferent
was
he
when
making
his
toilet
however
as
a
young
boy
he
sometimes
looked
in
his
small
glass
asking
himself
what
he
would
become
and
he
could
now
recall
his
looks
an
energetic
face
with
clearly
drawn
features
a
physiognomy
open
and
frank
without
being
pretty
but
not
disagreeable
his
beard
had
concealed
all
this
but
now
that
it
was
gone
he
said
to
himself
without
much
reflection
that
he
would
find
again
without
doubt
the
boy
he
remembered
what
he
saw
in
the
glass
was
a
forehead
lined
transversely
oblique
eyebrows
raised
at
the
inside
extremity
and
a
mouth
with
tightened
lips
turned
down
at
the
corners
furrows
were
hollowed
in
the
cheeks
and
the
whole
physiognomy
harassed
ravaged
expressed
hardness
what
had
become
of
that
of
the
young
man
of
other
days
he
had
before
him
the
man
that
life
had
made
and
of
whom
the
violent
contractions
of
the
muscles
of
the
face
had
modelled
the
expression
the
mouth
of
an
assassin
he
murmured
then
looking
at
his
shaved
head
he
added
with
a
smile
perhaps
that
of
one
condemned
to
death
whose
toilet
has
just
been
made
for
the
chapter
xxix
a
broken
negative
to
have
made
himself
unrecognizable
was
without
doubt
a
safe
precaution
but
having
started
on
this
course
he
would
not
be
easy
until
he
had
destroyed
all
traces
of
himself
in
such
a
way
that
madame
dammauville
would
never
be
able
to
find
the
man
that
she
had
seen
so
clearly
under
lamp
precisely
because
he
was
not
vain
and
had
no
pretension
to
beauty
he
had
escaped
the
photograph
mania
once
only
he
had
been
photographed
in
spite
of
himself
simply
to
oblige
a
classmate
who
had
abandoned
medicine
for
photography
but
now
this
once
was
too
much
for
there
was
danger
that
this
portrait
taken
three
years
before
and
showing
him
with
the
hair
and
beard
that
he
wished
to
suppress
might
be
discovered
without
doubt
there
were
few
chances
that
a
copy
of
it
would
be
seen
by
madame
dammauville
but
if
there
existed
only
one
against
a
hundred
thousand
he
must
arrange
it
so
that
he
need
have
no
fear
he
had
had
a
dozen
copies
of
this
photograph
but
as
his
relatives
were
few
he
kept
the
majority
of
them
one
he
sent
to
his
mother
who
was
living
at
that
time
another
went
to
the
priest
of
his
village
and
later
he
had
given
one
to
phillis
he
must
then
have
nine
in
his
possession
he
found
them
and
burned
them
immediately
of
the
three
that
remained
only
one
might
testify
against
him
the
one
belonging
to
phillis
but
it
would
be
easy
for
him
to
get
it
again
on
inventing
some
pretext
while
as
to
the
others
truly
he
had
nothing
to
fear
the
real
danger
might
come
from
the
photographer
who
perhaps
had
some
of
the
photographs
and
who
undoubtedly
preserved
the
negative
this
was
his
first
errand
the
next
day
on
entering
the
studio
of
this
friend
he
experienced
a
disagreeable
feeling
which
troubled
him
and
made
him
uneasy
he
had
not
given
his
name
and
counting
on
the
change
made
by
the
cutting
of
his
hair
and
beard
he
said
to
himself
that
his
friend
who
had
not
seen
him
for
a
long
time
certainly
would
not
recognize
him
he
had
taken
but
a
few
steps
his
hat
in
his
hand
like
a
stranger
who
is
about
to
accost
another
when
the
photographer
came
toward
him
with
outstretched
hand
and
a
friendly
smile
on
his
face
my
dear
friend
what
good
fortune
is
worth
the
pleasure
of
your
visit
tome
can
i
be
useful
to
you
in
any
way
recognize
me
then
do
i
recognize
you
do
you
ask
that
because
you
have
cut
your
hair
and
beard
certainly
it
changes
you
and
gives
you
a
new
physiognomy
but
i
should
be
unworthy
of
my
business
if
by
a
different
arrangement
of
the
hair
i
could
not
recognize
you
eyes
of
steel
like
yours
are
not
forgotten
they
are
a
description
and
a
then
this
means
in
which
he
placed
so
much
confidence
was
only
a
new
imprudence
as
the
question
recognize
me
then
was
a
mistake
i
will
pose
you
at
once
the
photographer
said
curious
this
shaved
head
and
still
more
interesting
i
think
than
with
the
beard
and
long
hair
the
traits
of
character
are
more
clearly
is
not
for
a
new
portrait
that
i
have
come
but
for
the
old
one
have
you
any
of
the
proofs
think
not
but
i
will
see
in
any
case
if
you
wish
some
they
are
easily
made
since
i
have
the
you
look
them
up
for
i
have
not
a
single
proof
left
of
those
you
gave
me
and
on
looking
at
myself
in
the
glass
this
morning
i
found
such
changes
between
my
face
of
and
that
of
three
years
ago
that
i
would
like
to
study
them
certain
ideas
came
to
me
on
the
expression
of
the
physiognomy
that
i
wish
to
study
with
something
to
support
the
search
for
the
proofs
made
by
an
assistant
led
to
no
results
there
were
no
proofs
and
for
several
days
i
have
thought
of
making
some
the
photographer
said
your
day
of
glory
will
come
when
your
portrait
will
be
in
a
distinguished
place
in
the
and
collections
every
one
talks
of
your
although
i
have
abandoned
medicine
without
the
wish
to
return
to
it
i
have
not
become
indifferent
to
what
concerns
it
and
i
learned
of
your
success
which
portrait
shall
we
put
in
circulation
the
old
or
the
new
let
us
arrange
the
it
is
only
yesterday
that
i
was
shaved
fearing
an
attack
of
pelagre
and
the
skin
covered
by
the
beard
has
a
crude
whiteness
that
will
accentuate
the
hardness
of
my
physiognomy
which
is
really
useless
we
will
wait
until
the
air
has
tanned
me
a
little
and
then
i
will
return
i
promise
many
proofs
do
you
want
of
your
old
portrait
will
will
send
you
a
not
take
the
trouble
i
will
take
them
when
i
come
to
pose
but
in
the
mean
time
could
you
not
show
me
the
plate
when
it
was
brought
saniel
took
the
glass
plate
with
great
care
holding
it
with
the
tips
of
his
fingers
by
the
two
opposite
corners
in
order
not
to
efface
the
portrait
then
as
he
was
standing
in
the
shadow
of
a
blue
curtain
he
walked
towards
the
chimney
where
the
light
was
strong
and
began
his
examination
is
very
good
he
said
a
photograph
can
have
this
documentary
to
compare
this
document
with
the
reality
saniel
approached
the
chimney
more
closely
above
which
was
a
mirror
when
his
feet
touched
the
marble
hearth
he
stopped
looking
alternately
at
the
plate
which
he
held
carefully
in
his
hands
and
at
his
face
reflected
in
the
glass
suddenly
he
made
an
exclamation
he
let
fall
the
plate
which
falling
flat
on
the
marble
broke
into
little
pieces
that
flew
here
and
there
awkward
i
am
he
showed
a
vexation
that
should
not
leave
the
smallest
doubt
in
the
mind
as
to
its
truth
must
get
one
of
the
proofs
that
you
have
given
away
his
friend
said
i
have
not
a
single
one
will
try
and
find
what
he
did
try
to
find
on
leaving
was
whether
or
no
he
had
succeeded
in
rendering
himself
unrecognizable
for
he
could
not
trust
to
this
experience
weakened
by
the
fact
that
this
old
friend
was
a
photographer
with
him
it
was
a
matter
of
business
to
note
the
typical
traits
that
distinguish
one
face
from
another
and
in
a
long
practice
he
had
acquired
an
accuracy
madame
dammauville
could
not
possess
among
the
persons
he
knew
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
one
in
the
best
condition
to
give
certainty
to
the
proof
was
madame
cormier
he
knew
at
this
hour
she
would
be
alone
and
as
she
had
not
been
assuredly
warned
by
her
daughter
that
he
intended
to
shave
the
experiment
would
be
presented
in
a
way
to
give
a
result
as
exact
as
possible
in
answer
to
his
ring
madame
cormier
opened
the
door
and
he
saluted
her
without
being
recognized
but
as
the
hall
was
dark
this
was
not
of
great
significance
his
hat
in
his
hand
he
followed
her
into
the
without
speaking
in
order
that
his
voice
should
not
betray
him
then
after
she
had
looked
at
him
a
moment
with
uneasy
surprise
at
first
she
began
to
smile
is
doctor
saniel
she
cried
dieu
how
stupid
of
me
not
to
recognize
you
it
changes
you
so
much
to
be
shaved
pardon
is
because
i
am
shaved
that
i
come
to
ask
a
us
my
dear
sir
ah
speak
quickly
we
should
be
so
happy
to
prove
our
would
ask
mademoiselle
phillis
to
give
me
if
she
has
it
a
photograph
that
i
gave
her
about
a
year
as
phillis
wished
the
liberty
to
expose
this
photograph
frankly
in
order
to
have
it
always
before
her
she
had
asked
for
it
and
saniel
had
given
it
to
her
in
her
presence
she
has
it
exclaimed
mme
cormier
my
dear
sir
you
do
not
know
the
place
that
all
your
goodness
and
the
services
that
you
have
rendered
us
have
made
for
you
in
our
and
passing
into
the
next
room
she
brought
a
small
velvet
frame
in
which
was
the
photograph
saniel
took
it
out
on
explaining
the
study
for
which
he
wanted
it
and
after
promising
to
bring
it
back
soon
he
returned
to
his
rooms
decidedly
everything
was
going
well
the
plate
was
destroyed
proof
in
his
hands
he
had
nothing
more
to
fear
from
this
side
as
to
the
experiment
made
on
the
mother
it
was
decisive
enough
to
inspire
him
with
confidence
if
madame
cormier
who
had
seen
him
so
often
and
for
so
long
a
time
and
who
thought
of
him
at
every
instant
did
not
recognize
him
how
was
it
possible
that
madame
dammauville
who
had
only
seen
him
from
a
distance
and
for
a
few
seconds
could
recognize
him
after
several
months
would
he
never
accustom
himself
to
the
idea
that
his
life
could
not
have
the
tranquil
monotony
of
a
bourgeois
existence
that
it
would
experience
shocks
and
storms
but
that
if
he
knew
how
to
remain
always
master
of
his
force
and
will
it
would
bring
him
to
a
safe
port
the
calm
that
was
his
before
this
vexation
came
back
to
him
and
when
the
last
proofs
of
his
concours
confirming
the
success
of
the
first
had
given
him
the
two
titles
that
he
so
ardently
desired
and
pursued
at
the
price
of
so
many
pains
so
many
efforts
and
privations
he
could
enjoy
his
triumph
in
all
security
he
held
the
present
in
his
strong
hands
and
the
future
was
his
now
he
could
walk
straight
boldly
his
head
high
jostling
those
who
annoyed
him
according
to
his
natural
temperament
although
these
last
months
had
been
full
of
terrible
agitation
for
him
on
account
of
everything
connected
with
the
affair
of
caffie
and
florentin
and
above
all
on
account
of
the
fatigue
emotion
and
the
fever
of
his
yet
he
had
not
interrupted
his
special
works
for
a
day
or
even
an
hour
and
his
experiments
followed
for
so
many
years
had
at
length
produced
important
results
that
prudence
alone
prevented
him

these

would
have
caused
the
hair
to
stand
upright
on
the
old
heads
and
it
was
not
the

when
he
asked
permission
to
enter
to
draw
upon
himself
the
hostility
of
these
venerable
doorkeepers
who
would
bar
the
way
to
a
revolutionist
but
now
that
he
was
in
the

for
ten
or
twelve
years
he

take
no
precautions

for

for
ideas

matters
saniel
saw
his
colleague
the
solemn
balzajette
and
so
adroitly
as
not
to
provoke
surprise
or
suspicion
he
spoke
of
madame
dammauville
in
whom
he
was
interested
incidentally
without
persisting
and
only
to
justify
his
question
he
explained
the
nature
of
this
interest
although
solemn
balzajette
was
not
the
less
a
gossip
and
it
was
his
solemnity
that
made
him
gossip
he
listened
to
himself
talk
and
when
his
chest
bulging
his
pink
chin
freshly
shaved
resting
on
his
white
cravat
his
hand
describing
in
the
air
noble
and
demonstrative
gestures
one
could
if
one
had
the
patience
to
listen
to
him
make
him
say
all
that
one
wished
for
he
was
convinced
that
his
interlocutor
passed
an
agreeable
moment
whose
remembrance
would
never
be
forgotten
his
patients
might
wait
in
pain
or
anguish
he
did
not
hasten
the
majestic
delivery
of
his
phrases
with
choice
adjectives
and
unless
it
was
to
go
to
a
which
he
did
at
least
five
days
in
the
week
he
could
not
leave
you
until
after
he
had
made
you
partake
of
the
admiration
that
he
professed
for
himself
it
was
to
an
affection
of
the
spinal
cord
that
mme
paralysis
was
due
and
consequently
it
was
perfectly
curable
even
balzajette
was
astonished
that
with
his
treatment
and
his
care
the
cure
was
delayed
what
shall
i
say
to
you
young
you
know
better
than
i
that
with
women
everything
is
possible
above
all
the
and
during
a
he
complaisantly
related
the
astonishment
that
the
fashionable
women
under
his
care
had
caused
him
in
spite
of
his
knowledge
and
experience
to
resume
what
shall
i
tell
you
young
and
he
repeated
and
explained
what
he
had
already
said
and
explained
although
balzajette
read
only
a
morning
paper
and
never
opened
a
book
he
had
heard
of
reputation
and
because
he
was
young
he
thought
he
might
manage
this
who
seemed
destined
to
make
a
good
position
in
spite
of
the
high
esteem
that
he
professed
for
his
own
merits
and
person
he
vaguely
felt
that
the
doctors
of
his
generation
who
were
eminent
did
not
treat
him
with
all
the
consideration
that
he
accorded
himself
and
in
order
to
teach
his
ancient
comrades
a
lesson
he
was
glad
to
enter
into
friendly
relations
with
a
young
one
le
he
would
speak
of
his
young
confrere
saniel
know
the
one
who
was
appointed
and
he
would
relate
the
advice
that
he
balzajette
had
given
him
that
madame
dammauville
would
be
well
enough
to
go
to
court
saniel
doubted
above
all
after
balzajette
had
explained
his
treatment
and
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
he
could
not
but
rejoice
doubtless
it
would
be
hard
for
florentin
not
to
have
this
testimony
and
not
to
profit
by
the
de
prepared
by
nougarede
but
for
himself
he
could
only
feel
happy
over
it
in
spite
of
all
the
precautions
he
had
taken
it
would
be
better
not
to
expose
himself
to
a
meeting
with
madame
dammauville
in
the
or
even
in
court
they
must
depend
upon
a
letter
supported
by
deposition
and
florentin
would
be
not
the
less
acquitted
only
nougarede
would
have
to
regret
his
de
but
the
satisfaction
or
disappointment
of
nougarede
was
nothing
to
him
but
he
did
not
tell
phillis
the
ideas
suggested
by
his
interview
with
balzajette
he
summed
up
the
conclusions
of
this
interview
balzajette
said
that
madame
dammauville
would
soon
be
on
her
feet
and
one
might
have
faith
in
his
word
florentin
would
be
saved
and
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
let
things
go
on
as
they
were
going
phillis
madame
cormier
nougarede
florentin
himself
whom
the
mazas
cell
had
reconciled
neither
with
hope
nor
with
providential
justice
were
all
delighted
with
this
idea
also
when
the
chamber
of
the
prosecution
sent
florent
to
the
assizes
the
emotion
of
madame
cormier
and
phillis
would
not
be
too
violent
madame
dammauville
would
be
in
a
state
to
make
her
deposition
since
the
evening
before
she
had
been
able
to
leave
her
bed
and
although
she
left
it
for
only
an
hour
and
then
to
go
from
her
bedroom
to
her
parlor
that
was
enough
nougarede
said
that
the
affair
would
come
on
at
the
second
session
in
april
between
then
and
now
madame
dammauville
would
be
solid
enough
on
her
legs
to
appear
before
the
jury
and
carry
the
acquittal
to
phillis
saniel
repeated
that
the
cure
was
certain
and
to
her
also
he
rejoiced
aloud
but
he
was
troubled
about
this
cure
this
meeting
only
the
idea
of
which
had
alarmed
him
to
the
point
of
losing
his
head
would
be
brought
about
and
under
conditions
that
could
not
but
affect
him
truly
the
precautions
he
had
taken
should
reassure
him
but
after
all
there
remained
no
less
a
troublesome
uncertainty
who
could
tell
he
preferred
that
she
should
not
leave
her
room
and
that
nougarede
should
find
a
way
to
obtain
her
deposition
without
taking
her
to
court
he
would
then
feel
more
reassured
more
calm
in
mind
and
with
a
more
impassive
face
he
could
go
to
court
was
he
really
unrecognizable
this
was
the
question
that
beset
him
now
many
times
he
compared
his
reflection
in
the
glass
with
the
photograph
that
he
had
given
phillis
the
hair
and
beard
were
gone
but
his
eyes
of
steel
as
his
friend
said
still
remained
and
nothing
could
change
them
he
might
wear
blue
eyeglasses
or
injure
himself
in
a
chemical
experiment
and
wear
a
bandage
but
such
a
disguise
would
provoke
curiosity
and
questions
just
so
much
more
dangerous
because
it
would
coincide
with
the
disappearance
of
his
hair
and
beard
but
these
fears
did
not
torment
him
long
for
phillis
who
now
passed
a
part
of
every
day
in
the
rue
with
madame
dammauville
came
one
evening
in
despair
and
told
him
that
that
day
the
invalid
had
been
able
to
leave
her
bed
for
a
few
minutes
only
then
she
would
not
go
to
court
this
apprehension
of
meeting
madame
dammauville
face
to
face
had
begun
to
exasperate
him
he
felt
like
a
coward
in
yielding
to
it
and
since
he
had
not
the
force
to
shake
it
off
he
was
happy
to
be
relieved
from
it
by
the
intervention
of
chance
which
after
having
been
against
him
so
long
now
became
favorable
the
wheel
turned
madame
dammauville
often
he
said
to
phillis
note
all
that
she
feels
perhaps
i
shall
find
some
way
to
repair
this
impediment
something
that
i
may
suggest
to
balzajette
without
his
suspecting
it
besides
it
is
reasonable
to
believe
that
the
recrudescence
of
cold
that
we
are
suffering
from
now
may
have
something
to
do
with
the
change
in
her
condition
it
is
probable
that
with
the
mild
spring
weather
she
may
he
hoped
by
this
counsel
to
quiet
uneasiness
and
to
gain
time
but
it
had
the
opposite
effect
in
her
anguish
which
increased
as
the
time
for
the
trial
approached
it
was
not
probabilities
any
more
than
the
uncertain
influence
of
the
spring
that
phillis
could
depend
on
she
must
have
something
more
and
better
but
fearing
a
refusal
she
forbore
to
tell
him
what
she
hoped
to
obtain
it
was
only
when
she
had
succeeded
that
she
spoke
every
day
on
leaving
madame
dammauville
she
came
to
tell
him
what
she
had
learned
and
for
three
successive
days
her
story
was
the
same
was
not
able
to
leave
her
and
each
day
he
made
the
same
reply
is
the
cold
weather
surely
we
shall
soon
have
a
change
this
frost
and
wind
will
not
continue
beyond
the
end
of
he
was
pained
at
her
desolation
and
anguish
but
what
could
he
do
it
was
not
his
fault
that
this
relapse
occurred
at
a
decisive
moment
fate
had
been
against
him
long
enough
and
he
was
not
going
to
counteract
it
at
the
time
when
it
seemed
to
take
his
side
by
yielding
to
the
desire
that
phillis
dared
not
express
but
which
he
divined
and
by
going
to
see
madame
dammauville
when
she
entered
his
office
on
the
fourth
day
he
knew
at
once
by
her
manner
that
something
favorable
to
florentin
had
happened
dammauville
is
up
he
said
thought
she
must
be
by
your
vivacity
and
is
because
i
am
happy
madame
dammauville
wishes
to
consult
he
took
her
hands
roughly
and
shook
them
have
done
that
he
exclaimed
she
looked
at
him
frightened
you
he
repeated
with
increasing
fury
least
listen
to
me
she
murmured
will
see
that
i
have
not
compromised
you
in
compromised
it
was
professional
dignity
of
which
he
thought
truly
do
not
want
to
listen
to
you
i
shall
not
not
say
only
needed
that
you
should
dispose
of
me
in
your
own
anger
carried
him
away
belong
to
you
then
i
am
your
thing
you
do
with
me
what
you
wish
you
decide
and
i
have
only
to
obey
there
is
too
much
of
this
you
can
go
everything
is
at
an
end
between
she
listened
crushed
but
this
last
word
which
struck
her
in
her
love
gave
her
strength
in
her
turn
she
took
his
hands
and
although
he
wished
to
withdraw
them
she
held
them
closely
in
her
own
may
throw
in
my
face
all
the
angry
words
you
please
you
may
reproach
me
as
much
as
you
think
i
deserve
it
and
i
will
not
complain
without
doubt
i
have
done
you
wrong
and
i
feel
the
weight
of
it
on
seeing
how
profoundly
you
are
wounded
but
to
send
me
away
to
tell
me
that
all
is
over
between
us
no
victor
you
will
not
do
that
you
will
not
say
it
for
you
know
that
never
was
a
man
loved
as
i
love
you
adored
respected
and
voluntarily
deliberately
even
to
save
my
brother
that
i
should
have
compromised
you
he
pushed
her
from
him
he
said
harshly
she
threw
herself
on
her
knees
and
taking
his
hands
that
he
had
withdrawn
she
kissed
them
passionately
listen
to
me
she
cried
condemning
me
hear
my
defence
even
if
i
were
a
hundred
times
more
guilty
than
i
really
am
you
could
not
drive
me
from
you
with
this
unmerciful
lose
your
head
anger
carries
you
away
what
is
the
matter
it
is
impossible
that
i
by
my
stupidity
through
my
fault
could
put
you
in
such
a
state
of
mad
exasperation
what
is
the
matter
my
beloved
these
few
words
did
more
than
despair
of
her
expressions
of
love
she
was
right
he
lost
his
head
and
however
guilty
she
might
be
towards
him
it
was
evident
that
she
could
not
admit
that
the
fault
she
committed
threw
him
into
this
access
of
furious
folly
it
was
not
natural
and
in
his
words
and
actions
all
must
be
natural
all
must
be
capable
of
explanation
well
speak
he
said
am
listening
to
you
moreover
it
is
better
to
know
speak
chapter
xxxi
the
appointment
should
understand
she
said
with
a
little
more
calmness
for
since
he
permitted
her
to
speak
she
hoped
to
convince
him
i
have
done
all
i
could
to
bring
madame
dammauville
to
the
idea
of
calling
in
consultation
with
monsieur
balzajette
a
doctor
would
be
or
another
i
have
not
mentioned
any
name
you
should
not
think
me
awkward
enough
to
put
you
forward
clumsily
it
would
not
be
a
good
way
to
make
you
acceptable
to
an
intelligent
woman
and
i
value
your
dignity
too
much
to
lower
it
i
believed
that
another
doctor
than
monsieur
balzajette
would
find
a
remedy
some
way
a
miracle
if
you
will
to
enable
madame
dammauville
to
go
to
the
palais
de
justice
and
i
said
it
i
said
it
in
every
tone
in
every
way
with
as
much
persuasion
as
i
could
put
in
my
words
was
it
not
the
life
of
my
brother
that
i
defended
our
honor
at
first
i
found
madame
dammauville
much
opposed
to
this
idea
she
would
be
better
soon
she
felt
it
otherwise
if
it
were
her
duty
to
be
carried
to
the
palais
de
justice
she
would
not
would
do
that
no
one
has
a
stronger
sense
of
justice
she
would
feel
guilty
did
she
not
give
her
testimony
to
save
an
innocent
person
not
to
save
him
when
she
could
would
be
to
take
the
responsibility
of
his
loss
it
is
therefore
certain
that
if
she
can
not
go
to
court
alone
she
will
do
all
she
can
to
go
no
matter
how
on
arm
or
on
a
stretcher
i
was
then
easy
enough
on
this
side
but
i
was
not
for
the
stretcher
what
would
people
think
to
see
her
in
this
condition
what
impression
would
she
make
on
the
jury
would
not
her
appearance
weaken
the
value
of
her
testimony
as
madame
dammauville
is
fond
of
me
and
very
kind
to
me
i
determined
to
profit
by
this
kindness
to
urge
a
consultation
but
without
mentioning
any
name
i
represented
to
her
that
since
balzajette
might
say
with
every
appearance
of
truth
he
had
cured
her
he
should
not
be
angry
if
she
desired
to
ratify
this
cure
that
besides
there
was
an
imperative
motive
that
would
not
permit
her
to
wait
for
it
would
be
very
disagreeable
to
her
to
present
herself
at
the
court
of
assizes
in
a
theatrical
way
which
was
not
at
all
according
to
her
character
or
habits
i
easily
discovered
that
the
fear
of
giving
pain
to
this
old
friend
of
her
husband
was
the
chief
reason
why
she
was
opposed
to
this
consultation
it
was
then
that
your
name
was
acknowledge
it
then
will
see
how
and
you
will
not
be
angry
about
it
i
have
often
spoken
to
madame
dammauville
of
mamma
and
consequently
of
how
you
cured
her
paralysis
that
resembled
hers
it
was
not
wrong
was
it
to
say
what
you
have
done
for
us
and
without
letting
any
one
suspect
my
love
i
could
praise
you
which
my
gratitude
prompted
she
asked
me
many
questions
and
naturally
as
usual
when
i
speak
of
you
when
i
have
the
joy
of
pronouncing
your
name
i
answered
in
detail
that
is
not
a
crime
she
waited
a
moment
looking
at
him
without
softening
the
hardness
of
his
glance
he
made
a
sign
to
her
to
continue
i
persisted
on
the
consultation
madame
dammauville
recalled
what
i
had
said
and
she
was
the
first
you
hear
the
first
to
pronounce
your
name
as
you
had
cured
my
mother
i
had
the
right
to
praise
you
with
a
nature
like
hers
she
would
not
have
understood
if
i
had
not
done
it
she
would
have
believed
me
ungrateful
i
spoke
of
your
book
on
the
diseases
of
the
spinal
cord
which
was
quite
natural
and
as
she
manifested
a
desire
to
read
it
i
offered
to
lend
it
to
that
natural
any
but
madame
dammauville
no
but
she
is
not
frivolous
i
took
the
book
to
her
two
days
ago
and
she
has
just
told
me
that
after
reading
it
she
has
decided
to
send
for
shall
certainly
not
go
she
has
her
own
not
imagine
that
i
have
come
to
ask
you
to
pay
her
a
visit
all
is
arranged
with
monsieur
balzajette
who
will
write
to
you
or
see
you
i
do
not
know
will
be
very
extraordinary
on
the
part
of
balzajette
you
judge
him
harshly
when
madame
dammauville
spoke
to
him
of
you
he
did
not
raise
the
smallest
objection
on
the
contrary
he
praised
you
he
says
that
you
are
one
of
the
rare
young
men
in
whom
one
may
have
confidence
these
are
his
own
words
that
madame
dammauville
told
do
i
care
for
the
opinion
of
this
old
beast
am
explaining
how
it
happens
that
you
are
called
into
consultation
it
is
not
because
i
spoke
of
you
but
because
you
have
inspired
monsieur
balzajette
with
confidence
however
stupid
he
may
be
he
is
just
to
you
and
knows
your
it
was
come
then
the
time
for
the
meeting
that
he
did
not
wish
to
believe
possible
and
it
was
brought
about
in
such
a
way
that
he
did
not
see
how
he
could
escape
it
he
might
refuse
phillis
but
balzajette
a
colleague
called
him
in
consultation
and
why
should
he
not
go
had
he
foreseen
this
blow
he
would
have
left
paris
until
the
trial
was
over
but
he
was
taken
unawares
what
could
he
say
to
justify
a
sudden
absence
he
had
no
mother
or
brothers
who
might
send
for
him
and
with
whom
he
would
be
obliged
to
remain
besides
he
wished
to
go
to
court
and
since
his
testimony
would
carry
considerable
weight
with
the
jury
it
was
his
duty
to
be
present
on
account
of
florentin
it
would
be
a
contemptible
cowardice
to
fail
in
this
duty
and
more
it
would
be
an
imprudence
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
he
must
appear
to
have
nothing
to
fear
and
this
assurance
this
confidence
in
himself
was
one
of
the
conditions
of
his
safety
now
if
he
went
to
court
and
from
every
point
of
view
it
was
impossible
that
he
should
not
go
he
would
meet
madame
dammauville
as
she
intended
to
be
carried
there
if
she
were
unable
to
go
in
any
other
way
whether
it
was
at
her
house
or
at
the
palais
de
justice
the
meeting
was
then
certain
and
in
spite
of
what
he
had
done
circumstances
stronger
than
his
will
had
prepared
it
and
brought
it
about
nothing
that
he
could
do
would
prevent
it
the
only
question
that
deserved
serious
consideration
just
now
was
to
know
where
this
meeting
would
be
the
least
dangerous
for
him
at
madame
or
at
the
palais
he
reflected
silently
paying
no
more
attention
to
phillis
than
if
she
were
not
present
his
eyes
fixed
his
brow
contracted
his
lips
tightly
closed
when
the
doorbell
rang
as
joseph
was
at
his
post
saniel
did
not
move
it
is
a
patient
phillis
said
who
did
not
wish
to
go
yet
will
wait
in
the
and
she
rose
before
she
could
leave
the
room
joseph
entered
balzajette
he
said
see
phillis
cried
without
replying
saniel
made
a
sign
to
joseph
to
admit
doctor
balzajette
and
while
phillis
silently
disappeared
he
went
toward
the
parlor
balzajette
came
forward
with
both
hands
extended
my
young
i
am
enchanted
to
meet
the
reception
was
benevolent
amicable
and
protecting
and
saniel
replied
at
his
best
we
met
the
other
day
balzajette
continued
have
thought
of
you
and
nothing
more
natural
than
that
for
you
inspired
me
with
a
quick
sympathy
the
first
time
you
came
to
see
me
you
pleased
me
immediately
and
i
told
you
you
would
make
your
way
do
you
remember
assuredly
he
remembered
and
of
all
the
visits
that
he
made
to
the
doctors
and
druggists
of
his
quarter
that
to
balzajette
was
the
hardest
it
was
impossible
to
show
more
pride
haughtiness
and
disdain
than
balzajette
had
put
into
his
reception
of
the
then
unknown
young
man
told
you
what
i
thought
of
you
continued
balzajette
is
with
regard
to
this
patient
of
whom
you
spoke
to
me
you
remember
dammauville
i
put
her
on
her
feet
as
i
told
you
but
since
then
this
bad
weather
has
compelled
her
to
take
to
her
bed
again
without
doubt
it
is
only
an
affair
of
a
few
days
but
in
the
mean
time
the
poor
woman
is
irritable
and
impatient
you
know
women
young
to
calm
this
impatience
i
spontaneously
proposed
a
consultation
and
naturally
pronounced
your
name
which
is
well
known
by
your
fine
work
on
the
medullary
lesions
i
supported
it
as
was
proper
with
the
esteem
that
it
has
acquired
and
i
have
the
satisfaction
to
see
it
saniel
thanked
him
as
if
he
believed
in
the
perfect
sincerity
of
this
spontaneous
proposition
like
the
young
and
whenever
an
occasion
presents
itself
i
shall
be
happy
to
introduce
you
to
my
clientage
for
madame
dammauville
when
can
you
go
with
me
to
see
her
as
saniel
appeared
to
hesitate
balzajette
mistaking
the
cause
of
his
silence
persisted
is
impatient
he
said
us
go
the
first
day
that
is
he
must
reply
and
in
these
conditions
a
refusal
would
be
inexplicable
suit
you
he
asked
by
all
means
at
what
hour
before
replying
saniel
went
to
his
desk
and
consulted
an
almanac
which
appeared
perfectly
ridiculous
to
balzajette
he
imagine
the
young
that
i
am
going
to
believe
his
time
so
fully
occupied
that
he
must
make
a
special
arrangement
to
give
me
an
hour
but
it
was
not
an
arrangement
of
this
kind
that
saniel
sought
his
almanac
gave
the
rising
and
the
setting
of
the
sun
and
it
was
the
exact
hour
of
sunset
that
he
wished
march
at
this
moment
it
would
not
be
dark
enough
at
madame
for
lamps
to
be
lighted
and
yet
it
would
be
dark
enough
to
prevent
her
from
seeing
him
clearly
in
the
uncertain
light
of
evening
a
quarter
past
six
suit
you
i
will
call
for
you
at
six
well
only
i
shall
ask
you
to
be
very
exact
i
have
a
dinner
at
seven
in
the
rue
saniel
promised
promptness
the
dinner
was
a
favorable
circumstance
enabling
him
to
escape
from
madame
before
the
lamps
would
be
lighted
when
balzajette
was
gone
he
rejoined
phillis
in
the
consultation
is
arranged
for
at
six
at
madame
she
threw
herself
on
his
breast
knew
that
you
would
forgive
chapter
xxxii
the
fatal
light
it
was
not
without
emotion
that
the
next
day
saniel
saw
the
afternoon
slip
away
and
although
he
worked
to
employ
his
time
he
interrupted
himself
at
each
instant
to
look
at
the
clock
sometimes
he
found
the
time
passing
quickly
and
then
all
at
once
it
seemed
to
stand
still
this
agitation
exasperated
him
for
calmness
had
never
been
more
necessary
than
at
this
moment
a
danger
was
before
him
and
it
was
only
in
being
master
of
himself
that
he
could
be
saved
he
must
have
the
coolness
of
a
surgeon
during
an
operation
the
glance
of
a
general
in
a
battle
and
the
coolness
and
the
glance
were
not
found
among
the
nervous
and
agitated
could
he
escape
from
this
danger
this
was
the
question
that
he
asked
himself
unceasingly
although
he
knew
the
uselessness
of
it
what
good
was
it
to
study
the
chances
for
or
against
him
either
he
had
succeeded
in
rendering
himself
unrecognizable
or
he
had
not
but
it
was
done
and
now
he
could
do
nothing
more
he
did
the
best
he
could
in
choosing
an
hour
when
the
dim
evening
light
put
the
chances
on
his
side
for
the
rest
he
must
trust
to
fortune
all
day
he
studied
the
sky
because
for
the
success
of
his
plan
it
must
be
neither
too
bright
nor
too
dark
if
it
were
too
bright
madame
dammauville
could
see
him
clearly
if
it
were
too
dark
the
lamps
would
be
lighted
he
remembered
that
it
was
by
lamplight
she
had
seen
him
until
evening
the
weather
was
uncertain
with
a
sky
sometimes
sunny
sometimes
cloudy
but
at
this
hour
the
clouds
were
driven
away
by
a
wind
from
the
north
and
the
weather
became
decidedly
cold
with
the
pink
and
pale
clearness
of
the
end
of
march
when
it
still
freezes
on
examining
himself
he
had
the
satisfaction
to
feel
that
he
was
calmer
than
in
the
morning
and
that
as
the
moment
of
attack
approached
his
agitation
decreased
decision
firmness
and
coolness
came
to
him
he
felt
master
of
his
will
and
capable
of
obeying
it
at
six
precisely
he
rang
at
door
and
they
started
immediately
for
the
rue
happy
to
have
a
complaisant
listener
balzajette
did
all
the
talking
so
that
saniel
had
only
to
reply
or
from
time
to
time
and
of
course
it
was
not
of
madame
dammauville
that
he
spoke
but
other
matters
of
a
first
representation
on
the
previous
evening
at
the
opera
comique
of
politics
of
the
next
salon
at
exactly
a
quarter
past
six
they
reached
the
house
in
the
rue
where
saniel
had
not
been
since
caffies
death
on
passing
the
old
lodge
he
felt
satisfied
with
himself
his
heart
did
not
beat
too
quickly
his
ideas
were
firm
and
clear
should
danger
arrive
he
felt
assured
of
mastery
over
himself
without
excitement
as
without
brutality
balzajette
rang
the
bell
and
the
door
was
opened
by
a
maid
who
was
evidently
placed
in
the
vestibule
to
await
their
arrival
balzajette
entered
first
and
saniel
followed
him
giving
a
hasty
glance
at
the
rooms
through
which
they
passed
they
reached
a
door
at
which
balzajette
knocked
twice
replied
a
feminine
voice
in
a
firm
tone
this
was
the
decisive
moment
the
day
was
everything
that
could
be
wished
neither
too
light
nor
too
dark
what
would
madame
first
glance
mean
confrere
doctor
saniel
balzajette
said
on
going
toward
madame
dammauville
and
taking
her
hand
she
was
lying
on
the
little
bed
of
which
phillis
had
spoken
but
not
against
the
windows
rather
in
the
middle
of
the
room
placed
there
evidently
after
the
experience
of
a
sick
person
who
knows
that
to
be
examined
she
must
be
easily
seen
profiting
by
this
arrangement
saniel
immediately
passed
between
the
bed
and
the
windows
in
such
a
way
that
the
daylight
was
behind
him
and
consequently
his
face
was
in
shadow
this
was
done
naturally
without
affectation
and
it
seemed
that
he
only
took
this
side
of
the
bed
because
balzajette
took
the
other
directed
by
saniel
the
examination
commenced
with
a
clearness
and
a
precision
that
pleased
balzajette
he
did
not
lose
himself
in
idle
words
the
young
any
more
than
in
useless
details
he
went
straight
to
the
end
only
asking
and
seeking
the
indispensable
and
as
madame
replies
were
as
precise
as
his
questions
while
listening
and
putting
in
a
word
from
time
to
time
he
said
to
himself
that
his
dinner
would
not
be
delayed
which
was
the
chief
point
of
his
preoccupation
decidedly
he
understood
life
the
young
he
might
be
called
in
consultation
with
his
heavy
appearance
and
careless
toilet
there
was
no
danger
of
rivalry
however
when
madame
dammauville
began
to
speak
of
being
sensitive
to
cold
balzajette
found
that
saniel
let
her
lose
herself
in
minute
details
you
always
been
sensitive
to
cold
and
with
a
deplorable
disposition
to
take
cold
if
the
temperature
is
lowered
one
or
two
you
exercise
in
the
open
air
you
ever
advised
to
try
of
cold
water
should
not
have
been
able
to
bear
must
tell
you
balzajette
interrupted
before
occupying
this
house
that
belongs
to
her
madame
dammauville
lived
in
a
more
modern
apartment
which
was
heated
by
a
furnace
and
where
consequently
it
was
easier
to
maintain
an
even
temperature
to
which
she
was
coming
to
live
in
this
house
where
it
is
not
possible
to
have
a
furnace
madame
dammauville
went
on
employed
every
means
to
shelter
me
from
the
cold
which
i
am
sure
is
my
great
enemy
you
can
see
that
i
have
had
put
at
the
doors
as
well
as
at
the
in
spite
of
this
invitation
and
the
gesture
which
accompanied
it
saniel
was
careful
not
to
turn
his
head
toward
the
window
he
kept
his
face
in
the
shadow
contenting
himself
with
looking
at
the
door
which
was
opposite
to
him
the
same
time
she
continued
had
hangings
put
on
the
walls
carpets
on
the
floors
thick
curtains
at
the
windows
and
doors
and
in
spite
of
the
large
fire
in
my
fireplace
often
i
am
unable
to
get
you
also
have
a
fire
in
this
little
stove
saniel
asked
pointing
to
a
small
movable
stove
at
the
corner
of
the
fireplace
at
night
so
that
my
servants
need
not
get
up
every
hour
to
replenish
the
fire
in
the
chimney
the
fire
is
made
in
the
evening
just
before
i
go
to
sleep
the
pipe
is
placed
in
the
chimney
and
it
maintains
sufficient
heat
until
think
it
will
be
expedient
to
suppress
this
mode
of
heating
which
must
be
very
inconvenient
saniel
said
my
and
myself
will
consider
the
question
whether
it
will
not
be
possible
to
give
you
the
heat
you
need
with
this
chimney
without
fatiguing
your
servants
and
without
waking
you
too
often
to
take
care
of
the
fire
but
let
us
when
he
reached
the
end
of
his
questions
he
rose
to
examine
the
patient
on
her
bed
but
without
turning
round
and
in
such
a
way
as
still
to
keep
his
back
to
the
light
as
little
by
little
the
reflection
of
the
setting
sun
faded
balzajette
proposed
asking
for
a
lamp
without
replying
too
hastily
saniel
refused
it
was
useless
the
daylight
was
sufficient
they
passed
into
the
parlor
where
they
very
quickly
came
to
an
amicable
conclusion
for
at
everything
that
saniel
said
balzajette
replied
am
happy
to
see
that
you
partake
of
my
opinion
that
is
it
truly
that
is
so
and
besides
each
had
his
reasons
for
hurrying
saniel
for
fear
of
the
lamps
balzajette
uneasiness
for
his
dinner
the
diagnosis
and
the
treatment
were
rapidly
settled
saniel
proposed
balzajette
approved
the
question
of
the
movable
stove
was
decided
in
two
words
for
the
night
a
grate
would
be
placed
in
the
chimney
a
fire
of
coal
covered
with
damp
would
keep
the
fire
until
morning
us
return
balzajette
said
who
took
the
initiative
and
decided
on
all
material
things
saniel
who
kept
his
eyes
on
the
windows
was
calm
it
was
yet
too
light
to
need
lamps
besides
during
their
no
servant
had
crossed
the
salon
to
enter
madame
room
but
when
balzajette
opened
the
door
to
return
to
the
patient
a
flood
of
light
filled
the
parlor
and
enveloped
them
a
lamp
with
a
shade
was
placed
on
the
little
table
near
the
bed
and
two
other
lighted
lamps
with
globes
were
on
the
mantel
reflecting
their
light
in
the
mirror
how
had
he
not
foreseen
that
there
was
another
door
to
madame
room
besides
the
door
from
the
parlor
but
if
he
had
foreseen
it
it
would
not
have
lessened
the
danger
of
the
situation
he
would
have
had
time
to
prepare
himself
that
was
all
but
to
prepare
himself
for
what
either
to
enter
the
room
and
brave
this
danger
or
to
fly
he
entered
is
what
we
have
decided
balzajette
said
who
never
lost
an
occasion
to
put
himself
forward
and
to
speak
while
he
spoke
madame
dammauville
seemed
not
to
listen
to
him
her
eyes
were
on
saniel
placed
between
her
and
the
chimney
with
his
back
to
the
lamps
and
she
looked
at
him
with
a
characteristic
fixedness
balzajette
who
listened
to
himself
observed
nothing
but
saniel
who
knew
what
there
was
behind
this
glance
could
not
but
be
struck
with
it
happily
for
him
he
had
only
to
let
balzajette
talk
for
if
he
had
spoken
he
would
surely
have
betrayed
himself
by
the
quivering
of
his
voice
however
balzajette
seemed
coming
to
the
end
of
his
explanations
suddenly
saniel
saw
madame
dammauville
extend
her
hand
toward
the
lamp
on
the
table
and
raise
the
shade
by
lowering
it
toward
her
in
such
a
way
as
to
form
a
reflector
that
threw
the
light
on
him
at
the
same
time
he
received
a
bright
ray
full
on
his
face
madame
dammauville
uttered
a
small
stifled
cry
balzajette
stopped
then
his
astonished
eyes
went
from
madame
dammauville
to
saniel
and
front
saniel
to
madame
dammauville
you
suffering
he
asked
at
what
then
was
the
matter
but
it
was
seldom
that
he
asked
for
an
explanation
of
a
thing
that
astonished
him
preferring
to
divine
and
to
explain
it
himself
i
understand
it
he
said
with
a
satisfied
smile
youth
of
my
young
astonishes
you
it
is
his
fault
why
the
devil
did
he
have
his
long
hair
and
his
light
curled
beard
cut
if
madame
dammauville
had
not
released
the
lampshade
she
would
have
seen
saniel
turned
pale
and
his
lips
quiver
voila
continued
balzajette
made
this
sacrifice
to
his
new
functions
the
student
has
disappeared
before
the
he
might
have
continued
along
time
neither
madame
dammauville
nor
saniel
listened
to
him
but
thinking
of
his
dinner
he
was
not
going
to
launch
into
a
discourse
that
at
any
other
moment
he
would
not
have
failed
to
undertake
he
rose
to
go
as
saniel
bowed
madame
dammauville
stopped
him
with
a
movement
of
her
hand
you
not
know
this
unfortunate
who
was
assassinated
opposite
she
asked
pointing
to
the
windows
so
serious
as
was
an
acknowledgment
saniel
could
not
answer
in
the
negative
was
called
in
to
prove
his
death
he
said
and
he
took
several
steps
toward
the
door
but
she
stopped
him
again
you
business
with
him
she
asked
saw
him
several
balzajette
cut
short
this
conversation
which
was
idle
talk
to
him
evening
dear
madame
i
will
see
you
tomorrow
but
not
in
the
morning
for
i
go
to
the
country
at
six
and
shall
not
return
until
chapter
xxxiii
suspense
you
observe
how
i
cut
the
conversation
short
balzajette
said
as
they
went
you
listen
to
women
they
will
never
let
you
go
i
can
not
imagine
why
she
spoke
to
you
of
this
assassinated
man
can
you
believe
that
this
assassination
has
affected
her
brain
to
a
certain
point
in
any
case
it
has
given
her
a
horror
of
this
he
continued
thus
without
saniel
listening
to
what
he
said
on
reaching
the
rue
balzajette
hailed
a
passing
cab
have
had
the
kindness
not
to
delay
me
he
said
pressing
the
hand
of
his
young
i
feel
that
i
must
hurry
a
good
riddance
this
babbling
gave
saniel
the
vertigo
he
must
recover
himself
look
the
situation
in
the
face
and
consider
that
which
might
which
must
happen
the
situation
was
plain
madame
cry
revealed
it
when
the
lamplight
struck
him
full
in
the
face
she
found
in
him
the
man
whom
she
had
seen
draw
caffies
curtains
if
in
her
amazement
she
at
first
refused
to
believe
it
her
questions
regarding
caffie
and
explanations
about
his
hair
and
beard
destroyed
her
hesitation
and
replaced
doubt
by
the
horror
of
certainty
he
was
the
assassin
she
knew
it
she
had
seen
him
and
such
as
she
revealed
herself
to
him
it
seemed
that
she
was
not
the
woman
to
challenge
the
testimony
of
her
eyes
and
to
let
the
strength
of
her
memory
be
shaken
by
simple
denials
supported
by
words
with
a
vivid
clearness
he
saw
to
the
bottom
of
the
abyss
open
before
him
but
what
he
did
not
see
was
in
what
way
she
would
push
him
into
this
giddy
whirlpool
that
is
to
whom
she
would
reveal
the
discovery
that
she
had
made
to
phillis
to
balzajette
or
to
the
judge
it
was
almost
a
relief
to
think
that
for
this
evening
at
least
it
would
not
be
to
phillis
for
at
this
moment
she
would
be
at
his
rooms
anxiously
awaiting
his
return
he
felt
a
sadness
and
a
revulsion
at
the
thought
that
she
might
be
the
first
to
learn
the
truth
he
did
not
wish
that
and
he
would
prevent
it
this
preoccupation
gave
him
an
object
he
reached
the
rue
thinking
more
of
phillis
than
of
himself
what
distress
when
she
should
know
all
how
could
she
support
this
blow
and
with
what
sentiments
would
it
inspire
her
with
what
judgment
for
the
man
whom
she
loved
poor
girl
he
grew
tender
at
the
thought
as
for
him
he
was
lost
and
it
was
his
fault
he
bore
the
penalty
of
his
own
stupidity
but
phillis
it
would
be
a
blow
to
her
love
that
she
must
bear
and
what
a
blow
to
this
sensitive
heart
to
this
proud
and
noble
soul
perhaps
he
would
now
see
her
for
the
last
time
for
this
one
hour
and
never
again
then
he
would
be
kind
to
her
and
leave
her
a
memory
that
later
would
be
an
alleviation
to
her
sorrow
a
warm
bright
ray
in
her
time
of
mourning
during
these
last
few
days
he
had
been
hard
brutal
irritable
strange
and
with
her
habitual
serenity
she
had
overlooked
it
all
when
he
pushed
her
from
him
with
his
heavy
hand
she
had
kissed
this
hand
fastening
on
him
her
beautiful
tender
eyes
full
of
passionate
caresses
he
must
make
her
forget
that
and
she
must
carry
from
their
last
interview
a
tender
impression
that
would
sustain
her
what
could
he
do
for
her
he
remembered
how
happy
she
had
been
at
their
impromptu
dinners
six
months
before
and
he
would
give
her
this
same
pleasure
he
would
see
her
happy
again
and
near
her
under
her
glance
perhaps
he
would
forget
tomorrow
he
went
to
the
caterer
who
furnished
him
with
breakfast
and
ordered
two
dinners
to
be
sent
to
his
rooms
immediately
before
he
could
put
the
key
in
the
lock
his
door
was
opened
by
phillis
who
recognized
his
step
on
the
landing
brother
is
dammauville
will
go
to
court
promise
you
that
he
is
you
by
me
in
her
access
of
joy
she
did
not
notice
the
accent
on
these
last
words
you
forgive
me
he
took
her
in
his
arms
and
kissing
her
with
deep
emotion
said
all
my
heart
i
swear
it
see
it
was
written
that
you
should
see
madame
dammauville
in
spite
of
yourself
in
spite
of
all
it
was
is
certain
that
your
friend
providence
could
not
interfere
more
opportunely
in
my
this
time
she
was
struck
by
the
tone
of
his
voice
but
she
imagined
that
it
was
only
this
allusion
to
superior
intervention
that
had
vexed
him
was
of
ourselves
that
i
thought
she
said
of
understood
but
do
not
let
us
talk
of
that
you
are
happy
and
i
do
not
wish
to
shadow
your
joy
on
the
contrary
i
thought
to
associate
myself
with
it
by
giving
you
a
surprise
we
are
going
to
dine
dearest
she
exclaimed
trembling
you
are
i
will
set
the
table
she
added
joyously
you
light
the
fire
for
we
must
have
a
bright
fire
to
enliven
us
and
to
keep
our
dinner
warm
what
have
you
ordered
do
not
know
two
much
the
better
we
will
have
surprises
we
will
leave
the
dishes
covered
before
the
fire
and
we
will
take
them
anyhow
perhaps
we
shall
eat
the
roast
before
the
entree
but
that
will
be
all
the
more
light
quick
busy
graceful
and
charming
she
came
and
went
around
the
table
when
the
dinner
came
the
table
was
ready
and
they
sat
down
opposite
to
each
other
happiness
to
be
alone
she
said
be
able
to
talk
and
to
look
at
each
other
freely
he
looked
at
her
with
a
tenderness
in
his
eyes
that
she
had
never
before
seen
with
a
depth
of
serious
contemplation
that
overwhelmed
her
from
time
to
time
little
cries
of
happiness
escaped
her
dearest
dearest
she
murmured
yet
she
knew
him
too
well
not
to
see
that
a
cloud
of
sadness
often
veiled
these
eyes
full
of
love
and
that
also
they
were
often
without
any
expression
as
if
they
looked
within
suddenly
she
became
quiet
but
she
could
not
long
remain
silent
when
she
was
uneasy
why
this
melancholy
at
such
a
moment
a
difference
between
this
dinner
she
said
those
of
the
end
of
october
at
that
time
you
were
harassed
by
the
most
trying
difficulties
at
war
with
creditors
menaced
on
all
sides
without
hope
and
now
all
is
smooth
no
more
creditors
no
more
struggles
the
cares
that
i
brought
you
are
nearly
at
an
end
life
opens
easy
and
glorious
the
end
that
you
pursued
is
reached
you
have
only
to
walk
straight
before
you
boldly
and
proudly
yet
there
is
a
sadness
in
your
face
that
torments
me
what
is
the
matter
speak
i
beg
you
to
whom
should
you
confess
if
not
to
the
woman
who
adores
you
he
looked
at
her
a
long
time
without
replying
asking
himself
if
for
the
peace
of
his
own
heart
this
confession
would
not
be
better
than
silence
but
courage
failed
him
pride
closed
his
lips
should
be
the
matter
he
said
my
face
is
sad
it
does
not
indicate
faithfully
what
i
feel
for
what
i
feel
at
this
moment
is
an
ineffable
sentiment
of
tenderness
for
you
an
inexpressible
gratitude
for
your
love
and
for
the
happiness
that
you
have
given
me
if
i
have
been
happy
in
my
rough
and
struggling
life
it
is
through
you
what
i
have
had
of
joy
confidence
hope
memories
i
owe
to
you
and
if
we
had
not
met
i
should
have
the
right
to
say
that
i
have
been
the
most
miserable
among
the
miserable
whatever
happens
to
us
remember
these
words
my
darling
and
bury
them
in
the
depths
of
your
heart
where
you
will
find
them
some
day
when
you
would
judge
judge
you
i
love
me
therefore
you
do
not
know
me
but
the
hour
will
come
when
you
will
wish
to
know
exactly
the
man
whom
you
have
loved
when
that
time
comes
remember
this
is
too
radiant
for
me
to
forget
it
may
be
remember
it
life
is
so
fragile
and
so
ephemeral
a
thing
that
it
is
beautiful
to
be
able
to
concentrate
it
to
sum
it
up
by
remembrance
in
one
hour
that
marks
it
and
gives
it
its
scope
such
an
hour
is
this
one
which
passes
while
i
speak
to
you
with
deep
phillis
was
not
accustomed
to
these
for
in
the
rare
effusions
to
which
he
sometimes
abandoned
himself
saniel
always
observed
a
certain
reserve
as
if
he
feared
to
commit
himself
and
to
let
her
read
his
whole
nature
many
times
he
rallied
her
when
she
became
sentimental
as
he
said
and
sa
romance
and
now
he
himself
sang
it
this
romance
of
love
great
as
was
her
happiness
to
listen
to
him
she
could
not
help
feeling
an
uneasy
astonishment
and
asked
herself
under
what
melancholy
impression
he
found
himself
at
this
moment
he
read
her
too
well
not
to
divine
this
uneasiness
not
wishing
to
betray
himself
he
brought
a
smile
to
his
eyes
and
said
do
not
recognize
me
do
you
i
am
sure
you
are
asking
yourself
if
i
am
not
dearest
do
not
jest
and
do
not
harden
yourself
against
the
sentiment
that
makes
such
sweet
music
on
your
lips
i
am
happy
so
happy
to
hear
you
speak
thus
that
i
would
like
to
see
your
happiness
equal
to
mine
to
dissipate
the
dark
cloud
that
veils
your
glance
will
you
never
abandon
yourself
at
this
hour
above
all
when
everything
sings
and
laughs
within
us
as
about
us
nothing
was
more
natural
than
that
you
should
be
sad
six
months
ago
but
today
what
more
do
you
want
to
make
you
happy
it
is
not
the
present
the
radiant
morning
of
a
glorious
future
will
you
there
are
sad
physiognomies
as
there
are
happy
ones
mine
is
not
yours
but
let
us
talk
no
more
of
that
nor
of
the
past
nor
of
the
future
let
us
talk
of
the
he
rose
and
taking
her
in
his
arms
made
her
sit
next
to
him
on
the
sofa
the
sound
of
the
doorbell
made
saniel
jump
as
if
he
had
received
an
electric
shock
will
not
open
the
door
phillis
said
not
let
any
one
take
our
evening
from
but
soon
another
ring
more
decided
brought
him
to
his
feet
is
better
to
know
he
said
and
he
went
to
open
the
door
leaving
phillis
in
his
office
a
maid
handed
him
a
letter
madame
dammauville
she
said
is
an
he
left
her
in
the
vestibule
and
returned
to
his
office
to
read
the
letter
the
dream
had
not
lasted
long
reality
seized
him
with
its
pitiless
hands
this
letter
certainly
would
announce
the
blow
that
menaced
him
saniel
is
disengaged
i
beg
that
he
will
come
to
see
me
this
evening
on
an
urgent
affair
i
will
wait
for
him
until
ten
if
not
i
count
on
seeing
him
morning
after
nine
he
returned
to
the
vestibule
to
madame
dammauville
that
i
shall
be
there
in
a
quarter
of
an
when
he
reentered
the
office
he
found
phillis
before
the
glass
putting
on
her
hat
heard
she
said
a
disappointment
but
i
can
not
wish
you
to
stay
since
it
is
for
florentin
that
you
leave
as
she
walked
toward
the
door
he
stopped
her
me
once
never
had
he
pressed
her
in
such
a
long
and
passionate
embrace
chapter
xxxiv
on
the
rack
he
had
not
a
second
of
doubt
madame
dammauville
did
not
wish
a
professional
visit
from
him
she
wished
to
speak
to
him
of
caffie
and
in
the
coming
crisis
he
said
to
himself
that
perhaps
it
was
fortunate
that
it
was
so
at
least
he
would
be
first
to
know
what
she
had
decided
to
do
and
he
could
defend
himself
nothing
is
hopeless
as
long
as
a
struggle
is
possible
he
rang
the
bell
with
a
firm
hand
and
the
door
was
opened
by
the
maid
who
brought
the
letter
with
a
small
lamp
in
her
hand
she
conducted
him
through
the
and
the
salon
to
madame
bedroom
at
the
threshold
a
glance
showed
him
that
some
changes
had
been
made
in
the
arrangement
of
the
furniture
the
small
bed
where
he
had
seen
madame
dammauville
was
placed
between
the
two
windows
and
she
was
lying
in
a
large
bed
with
canopy
and
curtains
near
her
was
a
table
on
which
were
a
shaded
lamp
some
books
a
a
teapot
and
a
cup
on
the
white
quilt
rested
an
unusually
long
bellrope
so
that
she
might
pull
it
without
moving
the
fire
in
the
chimney
was
out
but
the
movable
stove
sent
out
a
heat
that
denoted
it
was
arranged
for
the
night
saniel
felt
the
heat
and
mechanically
unbuttoned
his
overcoat
the
heat
is
uncomfortable
will
you
not
remove
your
overcoat
madame
dammauville
said
while
he
disposed
of
it
and
his
hat
placing
them
on
a
chair
by
the
fireplace
he
heard
madame
dammauville
say
to
her
maid
in
the
salon
and
tell
the
cook
not
to
go
to
what
did
this
mean
was
she
afraid
that
he
would
cut
her
throat
you
come
close
to
my
bed
she
said
is
important
that
we
should
talk
without
raising
our
he
took
a
chair
and
seated
himself
at
a
certain
distance
from
the
bed
and
in
such
a
way
that
he
was
beyond
the
circle
of
light
thrown
by
the
lamp
then
he
waited
a
moment
of
silence
which
he
found
terribly
long
slipped
away
before
she
spoke
know
she
said
at
last
i
saw
accidentally
from
this
she
pointed
to
one
of
the
windows
face
of
the
assassin
of
my
unfortunate
tenant
monsieur
cormier
has
told
me
he
replied
in
a
tone
of
ordinary
conversation
you
are
astonished
that
at
such
a
distance
i
saw
the
face
clearly
enough
to
recognize
it
after
five
months
as
if
it
were
still
before
is
to
those
who
have
a
memory
for
faces
and
attitudes
with
me
this
memory
has
always
been
strongly
developed
i
remember
the
playmates
of
my
childhood
and
i
see
them
as
they
were
at
six
and
ten
years
of
age
without
the
slightest
confusion
in
my
impressions
of
childhood
are
generally
vivid
and
persistency
does
not
only
apply
to
my
childish
impressions
today
i
neither
forget
nor
confound
a
physiognomy
perhaps
if
i
had
had
many
acquaintances
and
if
i
had
seen
a
number
of
persons
every
day
there
might
be
some
confusion
in
my
mind
but
such
is
not
the
case
my
delicate
health
has
obliged
me
to
lead
a
very
quiet
life
and
i
remember
every
one
whom
i
have
met
when
i
think
of
such
a
one
it
is
not
of
the
name
at
first
but
of
the
physiognomy
each
time
that
i
have
been
to
the
senate
or
to
the
chamber
i
did
not
need
to
ask
the
names
of
the
deputies
or
senators
who
spoke
i
had
seen
their
portraits
and
i
recognized
them
if
i
go
into
these
details
it
is
because
they
are
of
great
importance
as
you
will
it
was
not
necessary
for
her
to
point
out
their
importance
he
understood
her
only
too
well
fine
i
am
thus
she
continued
is
therefore
not
astonishing
that
the
physiognomy
and
the
attitude
of
the
man
who
drew
the
curtains
in
monsieur
office
should
not
leave
my
memory
you
admit
this
do
you
not
you
consult
me
i
must
tell
you
that
the
operations
of
the
memory
are
not
so
simple
as
people
imagine
they
comprise
three
things
the
conservation
of
certain
states
their
reproduction
and
localization
in
the
past
which
should
be
reunited
to
constitute
the
perfect
memory
now
this
reunion
does
not
always
take
place
and
often
the
third
is
do
not
grasp
your
meaning
very
well
but
what
is
the
third
thing
i
can
assure
you
that
in
this
case
it
is
not
lacking
the
action
beginning
in
this
way
it
was
of
the
utmost
importance
for
saniel
that
he
should
throw
doubts
in
madame
mind
and
should
make
her
think
that
this
memory
of
which
she
felt
so
sure
was
not
perhaps
as
strong
or
as
perfect
as
she
imagined
is
he
said
this
third
thing
that
is
the
most
delicate
the
most
complex
of
the
three
since
it
supposes
besides
the
state
of
consciousness
some
secondary
states
variable
in
number
and
in
degree
which
grouped
around
it
determine
madame
dammauville
remained
silent
a
moment
and
saniel
saw
that
she
made
an
effort
to
explain
these
obscure
words
to
herself
do
not
understand
she
said
at
last
this
was
exactly
what
he
wished
yet
as
it
would
not
be
wise
to
let
her
believe
that
he
desired
to
deceive
or
confuse
her
he
thought
he
might
be
a
little
more
precise
wish
to
ask
he
said
you
are
certain
that
in
the
mechanism
of
the
vision
and
that
of
the
recognition
which
is
a
vision
of
the
past
there
is
no
confusion
she
drew
a
long
breath
evidently
satisfied
to
get
rid
of
these
subtleties
that
troubled
her
is
exactly
because
i
admit
the
possibility
of
this
confusion
at
least
in
part
that
i
sent
for
you
she
said
order
that
you
might
establish
saniel
appeared
not
to
comprehend
madame
when
you
came
herewith
monsieur
balzajette
a
few
hours
ago
you
must
have
observed
that
i
examined
you
in
a
way
that
was
scarcely
natural
before
the
lamps
were
lighted
and
when
you
turned
your
back
to
the
daylight
i
tried
in
vain
to
remember
where
i
had
seen
you
i
was
certain
that
i
found
in
you
some
points
of
resemblance
to
a
physiognomy
i
had
known
but
the
name
attached
to
this
physiognomy
escaped
me
when
you
returned
and
i
saw
you
more
clearly
by
lamplight
my
recollections
became
more
exact
when
i
raised
the
the
light
struck
you
full
in
the
face
and
then
your
eyes
so
characteristic
and
at
the
same
time
a
violent
contraction
of
your
features
made
me
recall
the
name
this
physiognomy
these
eyes
this
face
belonged
to
the
man
whom
from
this
she
pointed
to
the
window
saw
draw
monsieur
caffies
saniel
did
not
flinch
is
a
resemblance
that
would
be
hard
for
me
he
said
your
memory
were
tell
myself
that
it
may
not
be
and
after
the
first
feeling
of
surprise
which
made
me
cry
out
i
was
confirmed
in
this
thought
on
recalling
the
fact
that
you
did
not
wear
the
long
hair
and
blond
beard
that
the
man
wore
who
drew
the
curtains
but
at
that
moment
monsieur
balzajette
spoke
of
the
hair
and
beard
that
you
had
had
cut
i
was
prostrated
however
i
had
the
strength
to
ask
if
you
had
had
any
business
with
monsieur
caffie
do
you
remember
your
answer
your
departure
i
experienced
a
cruel
anguish
it
was
you
whom
i
had
seen
draw
the
curtains
and
it
could
not
be
you
i
tried
to
think
what
i
ought
to
do
to
inform
the
judge
or
to
ask
you
for
an
interview
for
a
long
time
i
wavered
at
length
i
decided
on
the
interview
and
i
wrote
to
have
come
at
your
call
but
i
declare
that
i
do
not
know
what
to
reply
to
this
strange
communication
you
believe
that
you
recognize
in
me
the
man
who
drew
the
recognize
what
do
you
wish
me
to
say
it
is
not
a
consultation
that
you
ask
of
me
she
believed
she
understood
the
meaning
of
this
reply
and
divined
its
end
question
does
not
concern
me
she
said
my
moral
nor
mental
state
but
yourself
my
eyes
my
memory
my
conscience
bring
a
frightful
accusation
against
you
i
can
not
believe
my
eyes
or
my
memory
i
challenge
my
conscience
and
i
ask
you
to
reduce
this
accusation
to
how
madame
not
by
protestations
can
you
expect
that
a
man
in
my
position
will
lower
himself
to
discuss
accusations
that
rest
on
an
hallucination
you
believe
that
i
have
hallucinations
if
you
do
call
one
of
your
in
consultation
if
he
believes
as
you
do
i
will
submit
if
not
i
shall
be
convinced
that
i
saw
clearly
and
i
shall
act
you
saw
clearly
madame
and
i
am
ready
to
concede
this
to
you
it
proves
that
there
is
some
one
somewhere
who
is
my
said
this
to
myself
and
it
is
exactly
this
idea
that
made
me
write
to
you
i
wished
to
give
you
the
opportunity
of
proving
that
you
could
not
be
this
will
agree
that
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
admit
a
discussion
on
such
an
may
find
self
accused
by
a
concourse
of
fatal
circumstances
and
be
not
less
innocent
witness
the
unfortunate
boy
imprisoned
for
five
months
for
a
crime
of
which
he
is
not
guilty
and
i
pass
from
your
innocence
as
from
his
to
ask
you
to
prove
that
the
charges
against
you
are
are
no
charges
against
may
be
that
depends
upon
yourself
your
hair
and
beard
may
have
been
cut
at
the
time
of
the
assassination
in
that
case
it
is
quite
certain
that
the
man
i
saw
was
not
you
and
that
i
am
the
victim
of
an
hallucination
were
they
or
were
they
not
were
not
it
is
only
a
few
days
since
i
had
them
cut
on
account
of
a
contagious
may
be
she
continued
without
appearing
to
be
impressed
by
this
explanation
the
day
of
the
assassination
at
the
hour
when
i
saw
you
you
were
occupied
somewhere
in
such
a
way
that
you
can
prove
you
could
not
have
been
in
the
rue
and
that
i
was
the
victim
of
an
hallucination
and
again
it
may
be
that
at
the
time
your
position
was
not
that
of
a
man
at
the
last
extremity
forced
to
crime
by
misery
or
ambition
and
that
consequently
you
had
no
interest
in
committing
the
crime
of
a
desperate
man
what
do
i
know
twenty
other
means
of
defence
may
be
in
your
cited
the
example
of
this
poor
boy
who
is
imprisoned
although
innocent
would
it
not
be
applicable
to
me
if
you
did
not
recognize
the
error
of
your
eyes
or
your
memory
would
he
not
be
condemned
without
your
testimony
should
i
not
be
if
i
do
not
find
one
that
destroys
your
accusation
and
i
see
no
one
from
whom
i
can
ask
this
testimony
have
you
thought
of
the
infamy
with
which
such
an
accusation
will
cover
me
if
i
repel
it
and
i
shall
repel
it
will
it
not
have
dishonored
me
ruined
me
forever
is
just
because
i
thought
of
this
that
i
sent
for
you
to
the
end
that
by
an
explanation
that
you
would
give
it
seemed
to
me
you
would
prevent
me
from
informing
the
judge
of
this
suspicion
this
explanation
you
do
not
give
me
i
must
now
think
only
of
him
whose
innocence
is
proved
for
me
and
take
his
side
against
him
whose
guilt
is
not
less
proved
i
shall
inform
the
will
not
do
that
duty
compels
me
to
and
whatever
might
come
i
have
always
done
my
duty
for
me
in
this
horrible
affair
there
is
the
cause
of
the
innocent
and
of
the
guilty
and
i
place
myself
on
the
side
of
the
can
prove
to
you
that
it
was
an
aberration
of
vision
will
prove
it
to
the
judge
the
law
will
appreciate
he
rose
brusquely
she
put
her
hand
on
the
bellcord
they
looked
at
each
other
for
a
moment
and
what
their
lips
did
not
express
their
eyes
said
do
not
fear
you
my
precautions
are
bell
will
not
save
at
last
he
spoke
in
a
hoarse
and
quivering
voice
you
the
responsibility
of
whatever
happens
accept
it
before
god
she
said
with
a
calm
firmness
he
went
to
the
armchair
on
which
he
had
placed
his
coat
and
hat
and
bending
down
to
take
them
he
noiselessly
turned
the
draught
of
the
stove
at
the
same
time
madame
dammauville
pulled
the
bellcord
the
maid
opened
the
door
of
the
salon
doctor
saniel
to
the
chapter
xxxv
a
second
victim
on
returning
to
his
room
saniel
was
very
much
cast
down
and
without
lighting
a
candle
he
threw
himself
on
the
divan
where
he
remained
prostrated
the
frightful
part
of
the
affair
was
the
rapidity
with
which
he
condemned
this
poor
woman
to
death
and
without
hesitation
executed
her
to
save
himself
she
must
die
she
should
die
this
time
the
idea
did
not
turn
and
deviate
as
in
case
is
it
not
true
then
that
it
is
the
first
crime
that
costs
and
in
the
path
that
he
had
entered
would
he
go
on
to
the
end
sowing
corpses
behind
him
a
shudder
shook
him
from
head
to
foot
as
he
thought
that
this
victim
might
not
be
the
last
that
his
safety
demanded
when
she
threatened
to
warn
the
judge
he
only
saw
a
threat
if
she
spoke
he
was
lost
he
had
closed
her
mouth
but
had
not
this
mouth
opened
before
he
closed
it
had
she
not
already
spoken
before
deciding
on
this
interview
she
may
have
told
all
to
some
one
of
her
friends
who
between
the
time
of
his
departure
with
balzajette
and
his
return
might
have
visited
her
or
to
some
one
for
whom
she
had
sent
for
advice
in
that
case
those
also
were
condemned
to
death
a
useless
crime
or
a
series
of
crimes
the
horror
that
rose
within
him
was
so
strong
that
he
thought
of
running
to
the
rue
he
would
awake
the
sleeping
household
open
the
doors
break
the
windows
and
save
her
but
between
his
departure
and
this
moment
the
carbonic
acid
and
the
oxide
of
carbon
had
had
time
to
produce
asphyxiation
and
certainly
he
would
arrive
after
her
death
or
if
he
found
her
still
living
some
one
would
discover
that
the
draught
of
the
stove
had
been
turned
and
seeing
it
he
would
betray
himself
as
surely
as
by
an
avowal
after
all
the
maid
might
have
discovered
that
the
draught
was
turned
and
in
that
case
she
was
saved
and
he
was
lost
chance
would
decide
between
them
there
are
moments
when
a
shipwrecked
man
tired
of
swimming
not
knowing
to
which
side
to
direct
his
course
without
light
without
guide
at
the
end
of
strength
and
hope
floats
on
his
back
and
lets
himself
be
tossed
by
the
waves
to
rest
and
wait
for
light
this
was
his
case
he
could
do
nothing
but
wait
he
would
not
commit
the
insane
folly
of
wishing
to
see
and
know
as
in
case
he
would
know
the
result
soon
enough
too
soon
rising
he
lighted
a
candle
and
paced
up
and
down
his
apartment
like
a
caged
animal
then
it
occurred
to
him
that
those
underneath
would
hear
his
steps
doubtless
they
would
remark
this
agitated
march
would
be
surprised
and
would
ask
an
explanation
in
his
position
he
must
take
care
not
to
give
cause
for
any
remark
that
could
not
be
explained
he
took
off
his
boots
and
continued
his
walk
but
why
had
she
spoken
to
him
of
double
weatherstrips
at
the
doors
and
windows
of
hangings
on
the
walls
of
thick
curtains
it
was
she
who
thus
suggested
to
him
the
idea
of
the
draught
of
the
stove
which
would
not
have
come
to
him
spontaneously
the
night
passed
in
such
agitating
thoughts
at
times
the
hours
seemed
to
stand
still
and
again
they
flew
with
astounding
rapidity
one
moment
the
perspiration
fell
from
his
forehead
on
his
hands
at
another
he
felt
frozen
when
his
windows
grew
light
with
the
dawn
he
threw
himself
prostrated
and
shuddering
on
the
divan
and
leaning
on
a
cushion
he
detected
the
odor
of
phillis
burying
his
head
in
it
he
remained
motionless
and
slept
a
ring
of
the
bell
woke
him
horrified
frightened
he
did
not
know
where
he
was
it
was
broad
daylight
carriages
rumbled
through
the
street
a
second
ring
sounded
stronger
more
violent
shivering
he
went
to
open
the
door
and
recognized
the
maid
who
the
previous
evening
brought
a
note
from
madame
dammauville
he
did
not
need
to
question
her
fate
was
on
his
side
his
eyes
became
dim
without
seeing
her
he
heard
the
maid
explain
why
she
had
come
she
had
been
to
monsieur
balzajette
he
was
in
the
country
her
mistress
was
nearly
cold
in
her
bed
she
neither
spoke
nor
breathed
yet
her
face
was
pink
will
go
with
he
did
not
need
to
learn
more
that
rosy
color
which
has
been
observed
in
those
asphyxiated
by
oxide
of
carbon
decided
it
however
he
questioned
the
maid
nothing
had
occurred
she
had
talked
with
the
cook
in
the
kitchen
who
near
midnight
went
to
her
room
in
the
fifth
story
and
then
she
went
to
bed
in
a
small
room
contiguous
to
that
of
her
mistress
during
the
night
she
heard
nothing
in
the
morning
she
found
her
mistress
in
the
state
she
mentioned
and
immediately
went
for
monsieur
balzajette
continuing
his
questions
saniel
asked
her
what
madame
dammauville
did
after
the
consultation
with
monsieur
balzajette
dined
as
usual
but
less
than
usual
eating
almost
nothing
then
she
received
a
visit
from
one
of
her
friends
who
remained
only
a
few
minutes
before
starting
on
a
this
was
what
he
dreaded
madame
dammauville
might
have
told
this
friend
if
this
were
so
his
crime
would
be
of
no
use
to
him
where
would
it
carry
him
after
a
few
moments
and
in
a
tone
that
he
tried
to
render
indifferent
he
asked
the
name
of
this
friend
friend
of
her
youth
madame
thezard
living
at
no
in
the
rue
des
capucines
the
wife
of
a
until
he
reached
the
house
in
the
rue
he
repeated
this
name
and
address
to
himself
which
he
could
not
write
down
and
which
he
must
not
forget
for
it
was
from
there
now
that
the
danger
would
come
if
madame
dammauville
had
spoken
for
a
long
time
he
had
been
habituated
to
the
sight
of
death
but
when
he
found
himself
in
the
presence
of
this
woman
stretched
on
her
bed
as
if
she
slept
a
shiver
seized
him
me
a
mirror
and
a
candle
he
said
to
the
maid
and
the
cook
who
stood
at
the
door
not
daring
to
enter
while
they
went
in
search
of
these
things
he
walked
over
to
the
stove
the
draught
remained
as
he
had
turned
it
on
the
previous
evening
he
opened
it
and
returned
to
the
bed
his
examination
was
not
long
she
had
succumbed
to
asphyxiation
caused
by
the
gas
from
the
charcoal
did
it
proceed
from
the
construction
of
the
stove
or
from
a
defect
in
the
chimney
the
inquest
would
decide
this
as
for
him
he
could
only
prove
the
death
on
leaving
him
the
evening
before
phillis
uneasy
told
him
that
she
would
come
early
in
the
morning
to
know
what
madame
dammauville
wished
when
he
told
her
she
was
dead
she
was
prostrated
with
despair
in
that
case
florentin
was
lost
he
tried
to
reassure
her
but
without
success
nougarede
also
was
in
despair
and
regretted
that
he
had
not
proceeded
otherwise
and
he
tried
to
reassure
phillis
the
prosecution
rested
on
the
button
and
the
struggle
that
had
torn
it
off
saniel
would
destroy
this
hypothesis
he
counted
on
him
saniel
became
then
as
he
had
been
before
the
intervention
of
madame
dammauville
the
only
hope
of
phillis
and
her
mother
and
to
encourage
them
he
exaggerated
the
influence
that
his
testimony
would
have
i
shall
have
demonstrated
that
there
was
no
struggle
the
hypothesis
of
the
torn
button
will
crumble
by
if
it
is
sustained
how
and
with
what
shall
we
overthrow
it
if
he
had
appeared
as
usual
she
would
have
shared
the
confidence
with
which
he
tried
to
inspire
her
but
since
the
death
of
madame
dammauville
he
was
so
changed
that
she
could
not
help
being
uneasy
evidently
it
was
madame
death
that
made
him
so
gloomy
and
irritable
that
he
would
submit
to
no
opposition
he
saw
the
dangers
of
the
situation
that
this
death
created
for
florentin
and
with
his
usual
generosity
he
reproached
himself
for
not
having
consented
to
take
care
of
her
sooner
he
would
have
saved
her
certainly
as
he
had
begun
by
demanding
the
removal
of
the
stove
and
florentin
would
have
been
saved
also
the
day
of
the
trial
arrived
without
a
word
from
madame
thezard
which
proved
that
madame
dammauville
had
said
nothing
to
her
friend
it
was
six
months
since
the
assassination
occurred
and
the
affair
had
lost
all
interest
for
the
parisian
public
in
the
provinces
it
was
still
spoken
of
but
at
paris
it
was
a
thing
of
the
past
there
is
no
romance
about
a
clerk
who
cuts
the
throat
of
his
employer
to
rob
him
there
is
no
woman
in
the
case
no
mystery
saniel
preferred
that
phillis
should
remain
at
home
with
her
mother
but
in
spite
of
his
wishes
and
prayers
she
insisted
on
going
to
court
she
must
be
there
so
that
florentin
would
see
her
and
take
courage
he
would
defend
himself
better
if
she
were
there
he
defended
himself
badly
or
at
least
indifferently
like
a
man
who
gives
up
because
he
knows
beforehand
that
whatever
he
may
say
will
be
useless
until
deposition
the
witnesses
who
testified
were
insignificant
enough
and
revealed
nothing
that
was
not
already
known
only
valerius
with
his
pretensions
to
a
professional
secret
which
he
developed
slowly
amused
the
audience
this
deposition
saniel
made
brief
and
exact
contenting
himself
with
repeating
his
report
but
then
nougarede
rose
and
begged
the
president
to
ask
the
witness
to
explain
the
struggle
which
should
have
taken
place
between
the
victim
and
his
assassin
and
the
president
who
had
commenced
by
arguing
before
the
insistence
of
the
defence
decided
to
ask
this
question
then
saniel
slowly
explained
how
the
position
of
the
body
in
the
armchair
and
his
condition
were
scientific
proof
that
there
was
no
struggle
is
an
opinion
said
the
president
dryly
jury
will
appreciate
replied
nougarede
i
intend
to
make
the
jury
feel
the
weight
that
it
carries
on
the
authority
of
him
who
formulated
this
phrase
for
effect
was
destined
to
invalidate
in
advance
the
contradictions
that
the
prosecution
would
he
believed
raise
against
the
testimony
but
nothing
of
the
kind
occurred
and
saniel
could
go
and
take
his
place
beside
phillis
without
being
called
to
the
bar
to
sustain
his
opinion
against
a
physician
whose
scientific
authority
would
be
opposed
to
his
in
default
of
madame
dammauville
nougarede
had
summoned
the
concierge
of
rue
as
well
as
the
maid
and
the
cook
who
had
heard
their
mistress
say
that
the
man
who
drew
caffies
curtains
did
not
resemble
portrait
but
this
was
only
gossip
repeated
by
persons
of
no
importance
who
could
not
produce
the
effect
of
the
de
on
which
he
had
based
his
defence
when
the
pronounced
his
address
it
was
evident
why
opinion
on
the
absence
of
a
struggle
was
not
contradicted
although
the
prosecution
believed
in
this
struggle
it
wished
to
abandon
it
a
moment
having
no
need
of
this
hypothesis
to
prove
that
the
button
had
not
been
torn
off
on
falling
from
a
ladder
it
had
been
done
in
the
act
of
assassination
in
the
effort
made
to
cut
the
throat
of
the
victim
who
had
violently
extended
the
right
arm
and
by
the
shock
to
the
suspenders
the
button
was
torn
off
the
effect
of
deposition
was
destroyed
and
that
one
produced
by
the
testimony
of
madame
maids
far
less
strong
was
also
destroyed
when
the
proved
that
this
gossip
turned
against
the
accused
she
had
seen
it
was
said
a
man
with
long
hair
and
curled
beard
draw
the
curtains
very
well
does
this
description
apply
to
the
accused
to
tell
the
truth
it
was
said
that
she
did
not
recognize
him
in
a
portrait
published
by
an
illustrated
paper
well
it
was
because
this
portrait
did
not
resemble
him
besides
was
it
possible
to
admit
that
a
woman
of
madame
character
would
not
have
informed
the
judge
if
she
believed
her
testimony
important
and
decisive
the
proof
that
she
considered
it
insignificant
was
the
fact
that
she
had
kept
silent
eloquent
appeal
did
not
destroy
these
two
arguments
any
more
than
it
effaced
the
impression
produced
by
the
relative
to
the
theft
of
francs
the
jury
brought
in
a
verdict
of
but
without
premeditation
and
admitting
extenuating
circumstances
on
hearing
the
decree
that
condemned
florentin
to
twenty
years
of
forced
labor
phillis
half
suffocated
clung
to
arm
but
he
could
not
give
her
the
attention
he
wished
for
brigard
who
came
to
the
trial
to
assist
at
the
triumph
of
his
disciple
accosted
him
my
felicitations
for
your
deposition
my
dear
friend
it
is
an
act
of
courage
that
does
you
honor
if
this
poor
boy
could
have
been
saved
it
would
have
been
by
you
you
may
well
say
you
are
the

of
book
chapter
xxxvi
conscience
asserts
itself
during
the
first
years
of
his
sojourn
in
paris
saniel
had
published
in
a
latin
quarter
review
an
article
on
the
of
the
poison
of
hamlet
and
of
romeo
and
juliet
and
although
since
his
choice
of
medicine
he
read
but
little
besides
books
of
science
at
that
time
he
was
obliged
to
study
the
plays
of
his
author
from
this
study
there
lingered
in
his
memory
a
phrase
that
for
ten
years
had
not
risen
to
his
lips
and
which
all
at
once
forced
itself
uppermost
in
his
mind
with
exasperating
persistency
it
was
the
words
of
macbeth
does
murder
sleep
the
innocent
sleep
sleep
that
knits
up
the
sleeve
of
care
the
death
of
each
life
sore
bath
balm
of
hurt
he
also
had
lost
it
innocent
sleep
sore
bath
balm
of
hurt
he
had
never
been
a
great
sleeper
at
least
he
had
accustomed
himself
to
the
habit
hard
at
first
of
passing
only
a
few
hours
in
bed
but
he
employed
these
few
hours
well
sleeping
as
the
weary
sleep
hands
clenched
without
dreaming
waking
or
moving
and
the
thought
that
occupied
his
mind
in
the
evening
was
with
him
on
waking
in
the
morning
not
having
been
put
to
flight
by
others
any
more
than
by
dreams
after
death
this
tranquil
and
refreshing
sleep
continued
the
same
but
suddenly
after
madame
death
it
became
broken
at
first
it
did
not
bother
him
he
did
not
sleep
so
much
the
better
he
would
work
more
but
one
can
no
more
work
all
the
time
than
one
can
live
without
eating
saniel
knew
better
than
any
one
that
the
life
of
every
organ
is
composed
of
alternate
periods
of
repose
and
activity
and
he
did
not
suppose
that
he
would
be
able
to
work
indefinitely
without
sleep
he
only
hoped
that
after
some
days
of
twenty
hours
of
work
daily
overcome
by
fatigue
he
would
have
in
spite
of
everything
four
hours
of
solid
sleep
that
shakespeare
called
he
had
not
had
these
four
hours
and
the
law
that
every
state
of
prolonged
excitement
brings
exhaustion
that
should
be
refreshed
by
a
functional
rest
was
proved
false
in
his
case
after
a
hard
work
he
would
go
to
bed
at
one
in
the
morning
and
would
go
to
sleep
immediately
but
very
soon
he
awoke
with
a
start
suffocating
covered
with
perspiration
in
a
state
of
extreme
anxiety
his
mind
agitated
by
hallucinations
of
which
he
could
not
rid
himself
all
at
once
if
he
did
not
wake
suddenly
he
dreamed
frightful
dreams
always
of
madame
dammauville
or
caffie
was
it
not
curious
that
caffie
who
until
then
had
been
completely
effaced
from
his
memory
was
resuscitated
by
madame
dammauville
in
the
night
ghost
of
the
darkness
that
the
daylight
dissipated
believing
that
one
of
the
causes
of
these
dreams
was
the
excitement
of
the
brain
occasioned
by
excessive
work
at
the
hour
when
he
should
not
exercise
it
but
on
the
contrary
should
allow
it
to
rest
he
decided
to
change
a
plan
which
produced
so
little
success
instead
of
intellectual
work
he
would
engage
in
physical
exercise
which
by
exhausting
his
muscular
functions
would
procure
him
the
sleep
of
the
laboring
class
and
as
he
could
not
roll
a
wheelbarrow
nor
chop
wood
every
evening
after
dinner
he
walked
seven
or
eight
miles
rapidly
physical
work
succeeded
no
better
than
intellectual
he
endured
the
fatigue
of
butchers
and
but
he
did
not
obtain
their
sleep
decidedly
bodily
fatigue
was
worth
no
more
than
that
of
the
brain
it
was
worth
even
less
at
his
table
plunged
in
his
books
or
in
his
laboratory
over
his
microscope
he
absorbed
himself
in
his
work
and
by
the
force
of
a
will
that
had
been
long
exercised
and
submissive
to
obedience
he
was
able
to
keep
his
thoughts
on
the
subject
in
hand
without
distraction
as
without
dreams
time
passed
but
when
walking
in
the
streets
of
paris
in
the
deserted
roads
on
the
outskirts
by
the
seine
or
marne
his
mind
wandered
where
it
would
it
was
the
mistress
and
it
always
dwelt
on
madame
dammauville
caffie
and
florentin
it
seemed
as
if
the
heat
of
walking
started
his
brain
when
he
returned
in
this
state
after
many
hours
of
cerebral
excitability
how
could
he
find
the
tranquil
and
refreshing
sleep
complete
and
profound
of
the
laboring
classes
who
work
only
with
their
muscles
never
having
been
ill
he
had
never
examined
nor
treated
himself
medicine
was
good
for
others
but
useless
for
him
with
a
machine
organized
like
his
he
need
fear
only
accidents
and
until
now
he
had
been
spared
them
a
true
son
of
peasants
he
victoriously
resisted
paris
life
as
the
destroyer
of
the
intellect
but
the
time
had
come
to
undertake
an
examination
and
to
try
a
treatment
that
would
give
him
rest
he
was
not
a
sceptical
doctor
and
he
believed
that
what
he
ordered
for
others
was
good
for
himself
the
misfortune
was
that
he
could
not
find
in
himself
any
of
the
causes
which
resolve
into
insomnia
he
had
neither
meningitis
nor
brain
fever
nor
anything
that
indicated
a
cerebral
tumor
he
was
not
anaemic
he
ate
well
he
did
not
suffer
with
neuralgia
nor
with
any
acute
or
chronic
affection
that
generally
accompanied
the
absence
of
sleep
he
drank
neither
tea
nor
alcohol
and
without
this
state
of
of
the
encephalic
centres
he
might
have
said
that
he
was
in
good
health
a
little
thin
but
that
was
all
it
was
this
excitement
that
he
must
cure
and
as
there
are
many
remedies
for
insomnia
he
tried
those
which
it
seemed
to
him
were
suitable
to
his
case
but
bromide
of
potassium
in
spite
of
its
hypnotic
properties
produced
no
more
effect
than
the
of
the
brain
and
body
when
he
realized
this
he
replaced
it
with
chloral
but
chloral
which
should
create
a
desire
to
sleep
after
several
days
had
no
more
effect
than
the
bromide
then
he
tried
injections
of
morphine
it
was
not
without
a
certain
uneasiness
that
he
made
this
third
trial
the
first
two
having
met
with
so
little
success
and
since
it
is
acknowledged
that
chloral
produces
a
calmer
sleep
than
morphine
it
seemed
as
if
the
latter
would
prove
as
useless
as
the
former
however
he
slept
without
being
tormented
by
dreams
or
wakings
and
the
next
day
he
still
slept
but
he
knew
too
well
the
effects
produced
by
a
prolonged
use
of
these
injections
to
continue
them
beyond
what
was
strictly
indispensable
he
therefore
omitted
them
and
sleep
left
him
he
tried
them
again
then
soon
as
the
small
doses
lost
their
efficacy
he
gradually
increased
them
at
the
end
of
a
certain
time
what
he
feared
came
to
pass
his
leanness
increased
he
lost
his
appetite
his
muscular
force
and
his
moral
energy
his
pale
face
began
to
wear
the
characteristic
expression
of
the
morphomaniac
then
he
stopped
frightened
should
he
continue
he
would
become
a
morphomaniac
in
a
given
time
and
the
apathy
into
which
he
fell
prevented
him
from
resisting
the
desire
to
absorb
new
doses
of
poison
a
desire
as
imperious
as
irresistible
in
morphinism
as
that
of
alcohol
for
the
alcoholic
and
more
terrible
in
its
effects
the
perversion
of
the
intellectual
faculties
loss
of
will
of
memory
of
judgment
paralysis
or
the
mania
that
leads
to
suicide
if
he
did
not
continue
and
these
sleepless
nights
or
the
agitated
sleep
which
maddened
him
should
return
and
following
them
this
of
the
brain
in
troubling
the
nutrition
of
the
encephalic
mass
it
might
be
the
prelude
of
some
grave
cerebral
affection
on
one
side
the
morphine
habit
on
the
other
dementia
from
the
constant
excitement
and
disorganization
of
the
brain
between
a
fatally
certain
result
and
one
that
was
possible
he
did
not
hesitate
he
must
give
up
morphine
and
this
choice
forced
itself
upon
him
with
so
much
more
strength
because
if
morphine
assured
him
sleep
at
night
it
by
no
means
gave
him
tranquil
days
quite
the
contrary
he
began
to
use
this
remedy
at
night
when
he
fell
under
the
influence
of
certain
ideas
during
the
day
when
applying
himself
to
work
by
an
effort
of
will
he
escaped
from
these
ideas
and
was
the
man
he
had
always
been
master
of
his
strength
and
mind
but
the
action
of
the
morphine
rapidly
weakened
this
will
so
much
so
that
when
these
ideas
crossed
his
mind
during
his
working
hours
he
had
not
the
energy
to
drive
them
away
he
tried
to
shake
them
off
but
in
vain
they
would
not
leave
his
brain
to
which
they
clung
and
encompassed
it
with
increasing
strength
truly
those
two
corpses
troubled
him
horribly
was
it
not
exasperating
for
a
man
who
had
seen
and
dissected
so
many
that
there
should
be
always
two
before
his
eyes
even
when
they
were
closed
that
of
this
old
rascal
and
of
this
unfortunate
woman
in
order
not
to
complicate
this
impression
with
another
that
humiliated
him
he
got
rid
of
the
packages
of
bank
bills
taken
from
caffie
by
sending
them
to
the
director
of
public
charities
but
this
had
no
appreciable
effect
the
thought
of
florentin
troubled
him
also
and
if
he
saw
caffie
lying
in

it

not
less
cruel
to
see
florentin
between
the

of

that
would
soon
carry
him
to
new

the
ideas
on
conscience
that
he
had
expressed
at
and
those
that
he
explained
to
phillis
about
remorse
were
still
his
but
he
was
not
the
less
certain
that
these
two
dead
persons
and
the
condemned
one
weighed
upon
him
with
a
terrible
weight
frightful
suffocating
like
a
nightmare
it
was
not
in
accordance
with
his
education
nor
with
his
environment
to
have
these
corpses
behind
him
and
this
victim
before
him
but
where
his
former
ideas
were
overthrown
since
these
dead
bodies
seized
hold
of
his
life
was
in
his
confidence
in
his

the
strong

that

believed

of
things

of

of

not
at
all
the
one
that
reality
revealed
on
the
contrary
he
had
been
weak
in
action
and
yet
weaker
afterward
and
it
was
not
only
humiliation
in
the
present
that
he
felt
in
acknowledging
this
weakness
it
was
also
in
uneasiness
for
the

if
he
lacked
this
strength
that
he
attributed
to
himself
before
having
tested
it
he
should
if
his

were
true
succumb
some
day
evidently
if
he
were
perfectly
strong
he
would
not
have
complicated
his
life
with
love
the
strong
walk
alone
because
they
need
no
one
and
he
needed
a
woman
and
so
great
was
the
need
that
it
was
through
her

her
when
he
looked
at
her
when
he
listened
to
her

cowardly

attempted
reparation
because
he
felt
calm
when
with
phillis
saniel
wished
that
she
might
never
leave
him
but
as
happy
as
she
was
in
her
sorrow
to
see
that
instead
of
avoiding
her
which
a
less
generous
man
would
have
done
perhaps
he
sought
to
draw
nearer
each
day
she
could
not
give
up
her
lessons
and
her
work
which
was
her
daily
bread
to
give
all
her
time
to
her
love
any
more
than
she
could
leave
her
mother
entirely
alone
crushed
with
shame
who
had
never
needed
so
much
as
now
to
be
cheered
and
sustained
she
did
not
let
a
day
pass
without
going
to
see
saniel
but
in
spite
of
her
desire
she
could
not
remain
with
him
as
long
as
she
wished
and
he
asked
when
she
rose
to
go
and
he
detained
her
she
remained
but
it
was
only
for
a
few
minutes
they
were
short
and
the
time
soon
came
when
after
ten
attempts
she
was
obliged
to
leave
him
at
all
times
these
separations
had
been
full
of
despair
to
her
the
apprehension
of
which
from
the
moment
of
her
arrival
paralyzed
her
but
now
they
were
still
more
cruel
formerly
on
leaving
him
she
often
saw
him
deep
in
his
work
before
she
opened
the
door
now
on
the
contrary
he
conducted
her
to
the
vestibule
detained
her
and
only
let
her
leave
him
when
she
tore
herself
from
his
embrace
after
promising
and
repeating
her
promise
to
come
early
the
next
day
and
stay
longer
formerly
also
she
was
calm
when
she
left
him
not
thinking
of
his
health
nor
asking
herself
how
she
would
find
him
at
their
next
meeting
strong
and
powerful
as
sound
in
body
as
in
mind
on
the
contrary
now
she
worried
herself
wondering
how
she
would
find
him
on
the
occasion
of
each
visit
would
the
sadness
melancholy
and
dejection
still
remain
would
he
be
thinner
and
paler
it
was
her
care
her
anguish
to
try
to
divine
the
causes
of
the
change
in
him
which
manifested
itself
as
strongly
in
his
sentiments
as
in
his
person
was
it
not
truly
extraordinary
that
he
was
more
grave
and
uneasy
now
that
his
life
was
assured
than
during
the
hard
times
when
he
was
so
worried
that
he
never
knew
what
the
morrow
would
bring
he
had
obtained
the
position
that
his
ambition
coveted
he
had
sufficient
money
for
his
wants
he
admitted
that
his
experiments
had
succeeded
beyond
his
expectations
the
essays
that
he
published
on
his
experiments
were
loudly
discussed
praised
by
some
contested
by
others
it
seemed
that
he
had
attained
his
object
and
he
was
sad
discontented
unhappy
more
tormented
than
when
he
exhausted
himself
with
efforts
without
other
support
than
his
will
at
last
when
frightened
to
see
him
thus
she
questioned
him
as
to
how
he
felt
he
became
angry
and
answered
brutally
why
do
you
think
that
i
am
ill
am
i
not
better
able
than
any
one
to
know
how
i
am
i
am
overworked
that
is
all
and
as
my
life
of
privation
does
not
permit
me
to
repair
my
forces
i
have
become
anaemic
it
is
not
serious
it
is
strange
truly
that
you
ask
for
explanations
of
what
is
natural
count
the
teeth
of
the
polytechnicians
and
look
at
their
hair
after
their
examinations
and
tell
me
what
you
think
of
them
why
do
you
think
anything
else
is
the
matter
with
me
one
can
not
expend
self
with
impunity
that
would
be
too
good
everything
must
be
paid
for
in
this
she
was
obliged
to
believe
that
he
was
right
and
understood
his
condition
however
she
could
not
help
worrying
she
knew
nothing
of
medicine
she
did
not
know
the
meaning
of
the
medical
terms
he
used
but
she
found
that
this
was
not
sufficient
to
explain
all
neither
his
roughness
of
temper
and
excess
of
anger
without
reason
any
more
than
his
sudden
tenderness
his
weakness
and
dejection
his
preoccupation
and
absence
of
mind
she
discovered
the
effect
she
produced
on
him
and
how
merely
by
her
presence
she
cheered
this
gloomy
fancy
and
raised
this
depression
by
not
asking
him
stupid
questions
on
certain
subjects
which
she
had
not
yet
determined
on
but
which
she
hoped
to
avoid
also
she
did
not
wish
to
leave
him
and
ingeniously
invented
excuses
to
go
to
see
him
twice
a
day
in
the
morning
on
going
to
her
lessons
and
in
the
afternoon
or
evening
late
one
evening
she
rang
his
bell
with
a
hand
made
nervous
with
joy
have
come
to
stay
till
she
said
in
triumphant
tones
she
expected
that
he
would
express
his
joy
by
an
embrace
but
he
did
nothing
you
going
out
at
all
i
am
not
thinking
of
myself
but
of
your
you
think
that
i
would
have
left
her
alone
in
her
weak
and
nervous
state
a
cousin
of
ours
arrived
from
the
country
who
will
occupy
my
bed
and
i
profited
by
it
quick
enough
saying
that
i
would
remain
at
the
school
and
here
i
in
spite
of
his
desire
for
it
he
had
never
dared
ask
her
to
pass
the
night
with
him
during
the
day
he
would
only
betray
himself
by
his
sad
or
fantastic
temper
but
at
night
with
such
dreams
as
came
to
him
might
not
some
word
escape
that
would
betray
him
however
since
she
was
come
it
was
impossible
to
send
her
away
he
could
not
do
it
for
her
nor
for
himself
what
pretext
could
he
find
to
say
i
do
not
want
you
he
wanted
her
above
all
he
wanted
to
look
at
her
to
listen
to
her
to
hear
her
voice
that
soothed
and
lulled
his
anguish
to
feel
her
near
him
only
to
have
her
there
and
not
be
face
to
face
with
his
thoughts
she
examined
him
secretly
asking
herself
the
cause
of
this
singular
reception
standing
at
the
entrance
of
the
office
not
daring
to
remove
her
hat
how
could
her
arrival
produce
an
effect
so
different
from
what
she
expected
do
not
take
off
your
hat
he
said
was
asking
myself
if
you
had
to
do
you
ask
yourself
that
fear
of
disturbing
a
madness
you
have
for
always
asking
something
he
exclaimed
violently
do
you
expect
me
to
say
what
astonishes
you
why
should
you
disturb
me
in
what
speak
explain
yourself
the
time
was
far
distant
when
these
explosions
surprised
her
though
they
always
pained
her
speak
stupidly
she
said
will
you
i
am
stupid
forgive
these
words
me
were
more
cruel
than
numberless
reproaches
for
he
well
knew
that
he
had
nothing
to
forgive
in
her
since
she
was
the
victim
and
he
the
criminal
should
he
never
be
able
to
master
these
explosions
as
imprudent
as
they
were
unjust
he
took
her
in
his
arms
and
made
her
sit
by
him
is
for
you
to
forgive
he
said
and
he
was
as
tender
and
caressing
as
he
had
been
brutal
he
was
a
fool
to
imagine
that
she
could
have
suspicions
and
the
surest
way
to
give
birth
to
them
was
to
show
fear
that
she
had
them
to
betray
himself
by
such
awkwardness
was
as
serious
as
to
let
a
cry
escape
him
while
sleeping
but
for
this
night
he
had
a
way
which
was
in
reality
not
difficult
that
would
not
expose
him
to
the
danger
of
talking
in
his
would
not
sleep
after
having
passed
so
many
nights
without
closing
his
eyes
without
doubt
he
could
keep
them
open
this
entire
night
but
he
deceived
himself
when
he
heard
the
calm
and
regular
respiration
of
phillis
with
her
head
on
his
shoulder
and
felt
the
mild
warmth
of
her
body
penetrate
his
in
the
quiet
imposed
upon
him
without
being
conscious
of
it
believing
himself
far
from
sleep
and
convinced
that
he
required
no
effort
to
keep
awake
he
suddenly
slept
when
he
awoke
a
ray
of
pale
sunlight
filled
the
room
and
leaning
her
elbow
on
the
bolster
phillis
was
watching
him
he
made
a
brusque
movement
throwing
himself
backward
is
the
matter
he
cried
have
i
said
instantly
his
face
paled
his
lips
quivered
he
felt
his
heart
beat
tumultuously
and
his
throat
pressed
by
painful
constriction
nothing
is
the
matter
she
answered
looking
at
him
tenderly
have
said
to
come
to
the
point
why
should
he
have
spoken
during
his
frightful
dreams
his
nights
of
disturbed
sleep
he
might
have
cried
out
but
he
did
not
know
if
he
had
ever
done
so
and
besides
he
had
not
just
waked
from
an
agitated
sleep
all
this
passed
through
his
mind
in
an
instant
in
spite
of
his
alarm
time
is
it
he
asked
six
you
not
hear
the
vehicles
in
the
street
the
are
calling
their
it
must
have
been
about
one
when
he
closed
his
eyes
he
had
then
slept
five
hours
profoundly
and
he
felt
calm
rested
refreshed
his
body
active
and
his
mind
tranquil
the
man
of
former
times
in
the
days
of
his
happy
youth
and
not
the
man
of
these
last
frightful
months
he
breathed
a
sigh
if
i
could
have
you
always
he
murmured
as
much
to
himself
as
to
her
and
he
gave
her
a
long
look
mingled
with
a
sad
smile
then
placing
his
arm
around
her
shoulders
he
pressed
her
to
him
little
wife
she
had
never
heard
so
profound
so
vibrating
a
tenderness
in
his
voice
never
had
she
been
able
until
hearing
these
words
to
measure
the
depth
of
the
love
that
she
had
inspired
in
him
and
it
even
seemed
that
this
was
the
declaration
of
a
new
love
pressing
her
passionately
to
him
he
repeated
little
wife
distracted
lost
in
her
happiness
she
did
not
reply
all
at
once
he
held
her
from
him
gently
and
looking
at
her
with
the
same
smile
this
word
tell
you
nothing
tells
me
that
you
love
is
that
all
more
can
i
wish
you
say
it
i
feel
it
you
give
me
the
greatest
joy
of
which
i
can
is
enough
for
you
would
be
enough
if
it
need
never
be
interrupted
but
it
is
the
misfortune
of
our
life
that
we
are
obliged
to
separate
at
the
time
when
the
ties
that
unite
us
are
the
most
strongly
should
we
separate
mamma
and
daily
bread
you
did
not
leave
your
mother
if
you
need
no
longer
worry
about
your
life
she
looked
at
him
not
daring
to
question
him
not
betraying
the
direction
of
her
thoughts
except
by
a
trembling
that
she
could
not
control
in
spite
of
her
efforts
mean
if
you
become
my
my
beloved
you
not
she
threw
herself
in
his
arms
fainting
but
after
a
moment
she
recovered
it
is
impossible
she
murmured
impossible
not
ask
me
do
not
oblige
me
to
say
on
the
contrary
i
wish
you
to
tell
she
turned
her
head
away
and
in
a
voice
that
was
scarcely
perceptible
in
a
stifled
sigh
brother
is
greatly
on
account
of
your

suddenly

chapter
xxxviii
the
important
question
saniel
had
not
waited
until
this
day
to
acknowledge
the
salutary
influence
that
presence
exercised
over
him
yet
the
idea
of
making
her
his
wife
never
occurred
to
him
he
thought
himself
to
marriage
and
but
little
desirous
of
being
a
husband
until
lately
he
had
had
no
desire
for
a
home
this
idea
came
to
him
suddenly
and
took
strong
hold
of
him
at
least
as
much
on
account
of
the
calmness
he
felt
in
her
presence
as
by
the
charm
of
her
manner
her
health
happiness
and
gayety
it
was
not
only
physical
calm
that
she
gave
him
by
a
mysterious
affinity
concerning
which
his
studies
told
him
nothing
but
of
which
he
did
not
the
less
feel
all
the
force
it
was
also
a
moral
calm
there
were
duties
he
owed
her
and
terribly
heavy
were
those
he
owed
her
mother
and
florentin
he
did
all
he
could
for
florentin
but
this
was
not
all
that
he
owed
them
florentin
was
in
prison
madame
cormier
fell
into
a
mournful
despair
growing
weaker
each
day
and
phillis
in
spite
of
her
elasticity
and
courage
bent
beneath
the
weight
of
injustice
how
much
the
situation
would
be
changed
if
he
married
her
for
them
and
for
him
when
phillis
was
a
little
recovered
from
her
great
surprise
she
asked
him
did
you
decide
on
this
marriage
he
did
not
wish
to
prevaricate
and
he
answered
that
it
was
at
that
instant
that
the
idea
came
to
him
exact
enough
and
strong
enough
to
give
form
to
the
ideas
that
had
been
floating
in
his
brain
for
several
months
least
have
you
considered
it
have
you
not
yielded
to
an
impulse
of
love
it
be
better
to
yield
to
a
long
rational
calculation
i
marry
you
because
i
love
you
and
also
because
i
am
certain
that
without
you
i
can
not
be
happy
frankly
i
acknowledge
that
i
need
you
your
tenderness
your
love
your
strength
of
character
your
equal
temper
your
invincible
faith
in
hope
which
for
me
as
i
am
organized
is
worth
the
largest
is
exactly
because
i
have
no
dot
to
bring
you
when
you
were
at
the
last
extremity
desperate
and
crushed
i
might
ask
to
become
the
wife
of
the
poor
village
doctor
that
you
were
going
to
be
but
in
your
position
above
all
in
the
position
that
you
will
soon
occupy
is
poor
little
phillis
worthy
of
you
you
give
me
the
greatest
joy
that
i
can
ever
know
of
which
i
have
only
dreamed
in
telling
myself
that
it
would
be
folly
to
hope
to
have
it
realized
but
just
that
gives
me
the
strength
to
beg
you
to
reflect
and
to
consider
whether
you
will
ever
regret
this
moment
of
rapture
that
makes
me
so
have
reflected
and
what
you
say
proves
better
than
anything
that
i
do
not
deceive
myself
i
want
a
wife
who
loves
me
and
you
are
that
than
i
can
tell
you
at
this
moment
wild
with
happiness
but
not
more
than
i
shall
prove
to
you
in
the
continuance
of
our
dearest
do
not
have
any
illusions
on
the
splendors
of
this
position
of
which
you
speak
it
is
more
than
probable
that
they
will
never
be
realized
for
i
am
not
a
man
of
money
and
will
do
nothing
to
gain
any
if
it
does
not
come
by
itself
will
is
not
the
object
for
which
i
work
what
i
wish
i
have
obtained
partly
if
now
i
make
money
and
obtain
a
rich
practice
the
jealousy
of
my
confreres
will
make
me
lose
or
wait
too
long
for
what
my
ambition
prefers
to
a
fortune
for
the
moment
this
position
will
be
modest
my
four
thousand
francs
of
salary
that
which
i
gain
at
the
central
bureau
while
waiting
to
have
the
title
of
hospital
physician
and
five
hundred
francs
a
month
more
that
my
editor
offers
me
for
work
and
a
review
of
bacteriology
will
give
us
nearly
twelve
thousand
francs
and
we
must
content
ourselves
with
that
for
some
is
a
fortune
to
me
also
but
i
thought
i
ought
to
tell
when
do
you
wish
our
marriage
to
take
place
after
the
necessary
legal
delay
and
as
soon
as
i
am
settled
in
a
new
apartment
for
you
could
not
come
here
as
my
wife
where
you
have
been
seen
so
often
it
would
not
be
pleasant
for
you
or
for
we
will
not
be
so
foolish
as
to
put
ourselves
in
the
hands
of
an
upholsterer
the
first
one
cost
he
said
these
last
words
with
fierce
energy
but
continued
immediately
do
we
need
a
parlor
for
the
patients
if
they
come
an
office
for
me
which
will
do
also
as
a
laboratory
a
bedroom
for
us
and
one
for
your
wish
certainly
do
you
think
that
i
would
ask
you
to
separate
from
her
she
took
his
hand
and
kissing
it
with
a
passionate
impulse
the
dearest
the
most
generous
of
men
not
let
us
talk
of
that
he
said
with
evident
annoyance
your
condition
of
mental
prostration
it
would
kill
her
to
be
left
alone
she
needs
you
and
i
promise
to
help
you
to
soften
her
grief
we
will
make
her
comfortable
and
although
my
nature
is
not
very
tender
i
will
try
to
replace
him
from
whom
she
is
separated
it
will
be
a
happiness
to
her
to
see
you
for
a
long
time
he
enlarged
upon
what
he
wished
feeling
a
sentiment
of
satisfaction
in
talking
of
what
he
would
do
for
madame
cormier
in
whom
at
this
time
he
saw
the
mother
of
florentin
more
than
that
of
phillis
you
think
you
can
make
her
forget
he
asked
from
time
to
time
no
neither
she
nor
i
can
ever
forget
but
it
is
certain
our
sorrow
will
be
drowned
in
our
happiness
and
this
happiness
we
shall
owe
to
you
oh
how
you
will
be
adored
respected
blessed
adored
respected
he
repeated
these
words
to
himself
one
could
then
be
happy
by
making
others
happy
he
had
had
so
little
opportunity
until
this
time
to
do
for
others
that
this
was
in
some
sort
the
revelation
of
a
sentiment
that
he
was
astonished
to
feel
but
which
for
being
new
was
only
the
sweeter
to
him
he
wished
to
give
himself
the
satisfaction
of
tasting
all
the
sweetness
are
you
going
this
morning
he
asked
return
to
the
school
to
help
my
pupils
prepare
their
compositions
for
the
well
while
you
are
at
the
school
this
morning
i
will
go
to
see
your
mother
the
process
of
asking
in
marriage
that
we
make
use
of
is
perhaps
original
and
conforms
to
the
laws
of
nature
if
nature
admits
marriage
which
i
ignore
but
it
certainly
is
not
the
way
of
those
of
the
world
and
now
i
must
address
this
request
to
your
joy
you
will
give
her
hope
should
like
to
be
there
to
enjoy
her
happiness
mamma
has
a
mania
for
marriage
she
spends
her
time
marrying
the
people
she
knows
or
those
she
does
not
know
and
she
has
felt
convinced
that
i
should
die
in
the
yellow
skin
of
an
old
maid
at
last
this
evening
she
will
have
the
happiness
of
announcing
to
me
your
visit
and
your
request
but
do
not
make
this
visit
until
the
afternoon
because
then
our
cousin
will
be
saniel
spent
his
morning
in
looking
for
apartments
and
found
one
in
a
quarter
of
the
invalides
which
he
engaged
it
was
nearly
one
when
he
reached
madame
as
usual
when
he
called
she
looked
at
him
with
anxious
curiosity
thinking
of
florentin
is
not
of
him
that
i
wish
to
speak
to
you
he
said
without
pronouncing
any
name
which
was
unnecessary
is
of
mademoiselle
phillis
you
find
her
ill
madame
cormier
said
who
thought
only
of
misfortune
at
all
it
is
of
her
and
of
myself
that
i
wish
to
speak
do
not
be
uneasy
i
hope
that
what
i
am
going
to
say
will
not
be
a
cause
of
sadness
to
me
if
i
always
see
something
to
fear
we
have
been
so
frightfully
tried
so
unjustly
he
interrupted
her
for
these
complaints
did
not
please
him
a
long
time
he
said
quickly
phillis
has
inspired
me
with
a
deep
sentiment
of
esteem
and
tenderness
i
have
not
been
able
to
see
her
so
courageous
so
brave
in
adversity
so
decided
in
her
character
so
good
to
you
so
charming
without
loving
her
and
i
have
come
to
ask
you
to
give
her
to
me
as
my
at
words
madame
hands
began
to
tremble
and
the
trembling
increased
it
possible
she
murmured
beginning
to
cry
great
a
happiness
for
my
daughter
such
an
honor
for
us
for
us
for
us
love
me
if
happiness
makes
me
forget
the
conventionalities
but
i
lose
my
head
we
are
so
unhappy
that
our
souls
are
weak
against
joy
perhaps
i
should
hide
my
sentiments
but
i
can
not
help
telling
you
that
this
esteem
this
tenderness
of
which
you
speak
is
felt
by
her
i
discovered
it
long
ago
although
she
did
not
tell
me
your
request
then
can
only
be
received
with
joy
by
mother
as
well
as
this
was
said
brokenly
evidently
from
an
overflowing
heart
but
all
at
once
her
face
saddened
must
talk
to
you
sincerely
she
said
are
young
i
am
not
and
my
age
makes
it
a
duty
for
me
not
to
yield
to
any
impulse
we
are
unfortunates
you
are
one
of
the
happy
you
will
soon
be
rich
and
famous
is
it
wise
to
burden
your
life
with
a
wife
who
is
in
my
position
with
the
exception
of
a
few
words
this
was
answer
he
answered
the
mother
as
he
had
answered
the
daughter
is
not
for
you
that
i
speak
said
madame
cormier
should
not
permit
myself
to
give
you
advice
it
is
in
placing
myself
at
the
point
of
view
of
my
daughter
that
i
her
mother
with
the
experience
of
my
age
should
watch
over
her
future
is
it
certain
that
in
the
struggles
of
life
you
will
never
suffer
from
this
marriage
not
because
my
daughter
will
not
make
you
happy
from
this
side
i
am
easy
but
because
the
situation
that
fate
has
made
for
us
will
weigh
on
you
and
fetter
you
i
know
my
delicacy
her
uneasy
susceptibility
that
of
the
unfortunate
her
pride
that
of
the
irreproachable
it
would
be
a
wound
for
her
that
would
make
happiness
give
way
to
unhappiness
for
she
could
not
bear
that
is
in
human
nature
it
is
not
in
mine
i
give
you
my
he
explained
how
he
meant
to
arrange
their
life
and
when
she
understood
that
she
was
to
live
with
them
she
clasped
her
hands
and
exclaimed
my
god
who
hast
taken
my
son
how
good
thou
art
to
give
me
another
chapter
xxxix
concession
to
conscience
he
asked
nothing
better
than
to
be
a
son
to
this
poor
woman
in
reality
he
was
worth
much
more
than
this
unfortunate
boy
effeminate
and
incapable
what
did
this
maternal
hunger
require
a
son
to
love
she
would
find
one
in
her
in
seeing
her
daughter
happy
how
could
she
help
being
happy
herself
evidently
they
would
be
happy
the
mother
and
daughter
and
whatever
phillis
might
think
still
under
the
influence
of
the
shameful
blow
they
would
forget
they
would
owe
him
this
it
was
a
long
time
since
he
had
worked
with
so
much
serenity
as
on
this
day
and
when
in
the
evening
he
went
to
bed
uneasy
as
usual
about
the
night
he
slept
as
calmly
as
if
phillis
were
resting
her
charming
head
on
his
shoulder
and
he
breathed
the
perfume
of
it
decidedly
to
make
others
happy
was
the
best
thing
in
the
world
and
as
long
as
one
could
have
this
satisfaction
there
was
no
fear
of
being
unhappy
to
create
an
atmosphere
of
happiness
for
others
is
to
profit
by
it
at
the
same
time
he
waited
for
phillis
impatiently
for
she
would
bring
him
an
echo
of
her
joy
and
it
was
a
recompense
that
she
owed
him
she
arrived
happy
smiling
penetrated
with
tenderness
but
he
observed
that
she
was
keeping
something
from
him
something
that
embarrassed
her
and
yet
she
would
not
tell
him
what
it
was
he
was
not
disposed
to
admit
that
she
could
conceal
anything
from
him
and
he
questioned
her
are
you
keeping
from
me
can
you
suppose
that
i
should
keep
anything
from
you
what
is
the
matter
you
know
do
you
not
that
i
read
all
your
thoughts
in
your
eyes
very
well
your
eyes
speak
when
your
lips
are
have
a
request
to
make
of
you
a
do
you
not
tell
me
i
do
not
it
does
not
seem
to
me
that
i
show
a
disposition
to
make
you
believe
that
i
could
refuse
you
is
just
that
which
is
the
cause
of
my
embarrassment
and
reserve
i
fear
to
pain
you
at
the
moment
when
i
would
show
you
all
the
gratitude
and
love
in
my
you
are
going
to
give
me
pain
it
is
better
not
to
make
me
she
hesitated
then
before
an
impatient
gesture
she
decided
to
speak
wish
to
ask
you
how
you
mean
to
be
married
he
looked
at
her
in
surprise
like
every
one
else
one
she
asked
persistently
there
any
other
way
of
being
married
do
not
in
the
least
understand
this
manner
of
asking
conundrums
if
you
are
alluding
to
a
fashionable
custom
of
which
i
know
nothing
say
so
frankly
that
will
not
wound
me
since
i
am
the
first
to
declare
that
i
know
nothing
of
it
what
do
you
wish
she
felt
his
irritation
increase
and
yet
she
could
not
decide
to
say
what
she
wished
have
begun
badly
she
said
should
have
told
you
at
first
that
you
will
always
find
in
me
a
wife
who
will
respect
your
ideas
and
beliefs
who
will
never
permit
herself
to
judge
you
and
still
less
to
seek
to
contend
with
them
or
to
modify
them
that
you
feel
do
you
not
is
neither
a
part
of
my
nature
nor
of
my
love
he
said
impatiently
think
then
she
said
with
timid
hesitation
you
will
not
say
that
i
fail
in
respect
to
your
ideas
in
asking
that
our
marriage
take
place
in
that
was
my
she
exclaimed
dearest
and
i
feared
to
offend
you
should
you
think
it
would
offend
me
he
asked
smiling
consent
to
go
to
confession
instantly
the
smile
in
his
eyes
and
on
his
lips
was
replaced
by
a
gleam
of
fury
why
should
i
not
go
to
confession
he
demanded
you
suppose
that
i
can
be
afraid
to
confess
why
do
you
suppose
that
tell
me
why
he
looked
at
her
with
eyes
that
pierced
to
her
heart
as
if
they
would
read
her
inmost
thoughts
stupefied
by
this
access
of
fury
which
burst
forth
without
any
warning
since
he
had
smilingly
replied
to
her
request
for
a
religious
marriage
she
could
find
nothing
to
say
not
understanding
how
the
simple
word
could
so
exasperate
him
and
yet
she
could
not
deceive
herself
is
was
indeed
this
word
and
no
other
that
put
him
in
this
state
he
continued
to
look
at
her
and
wishing
to
explain
herself
she
said
supposed
only
one
thing
and
that
is
that
i
might
offend
you
by
asking
you
to
do
what
is
contrary
to
your
the
mad
anger
that
carried
him
away
so
stupidly
began
to
lose
its
first
violence
another
word
added
to
what
had
already
escaped
him
would
be
an
avowal
not
let
us
talk
of
it
anymore
he
said
all
do
not
let
us
think
of
me
to
say
one
word
she
replied
i
been
situated
like
other
people
i
would
have
asked
nothing
my
will
is
yours
but
for
you
for
your
future
and
your
honor
you
should
not
appear
to
marry
in
secret
as
if
ashamed
with
a
easy
i
feel
as
you
do
more
than
you
the
necessity
of
consecrated
ceremonies
for
she
understood
that
on
this
path
he
would
go
farther
than
she
to
destroy
the
impression
of
this
unfortunate
word
he
proposed
that
they
should
visit
the
apartment
he
had
engaged
the
previous
day
for
the
first
time
they
walked
together
boldly
with
heads
held
high
side
by
side
in
the
streets
of
paris
without
fear
of
meeting
others
how
proud
she
was
her
husband
it
was
on
her
arm
that
she
leaned
when
they
crossed
the
tuileries
she
was
almost
surprised
that
people
did
not
turn
to
see
them
pass
in
her
present
state
of
mind
she
could
not
but
find
the
house
he
chose
admirable
the
street
was
admirable
the
house
was
admirable
the
apartment
was
admirable
as
it
contained
three
bedrooms
opening
on
a
terrace
where
he
would
keep
the
animals
for
his
experiments
saniel
wished
to
have
her
decide
which
one
she
would
choose
as
she
would
share
it
with
him
she
wished
to
take
the
best
but
he
would
not
accept
this
arrangement
want
you
to
choose
between
the
two
little
ones
he
said
largest
and
best
must
be
reserved
for
your
mother
who
not
being
able
to
go
out
needs
more
space
air
and
light
than
we
she
was
transported
with
his
kindness
delicacy
and
generosity
never
would
she
be
able
to
love
him
enough
to
raise
herself
up
to
him
fortunately
the
principal
rooms
the
parlor
and
the
office
were
about
the
same
size
as
those
in
the
rue
so
there
need
be
but
little
change
in
furnishing
and
they
would
bring
their
furniture
from
the
rue
des
moines
this
feminine
talk
interrupted
by
passionate
exclamations
and
glances
charmed
saniel
who
had
forgotten
the
incident
of
the
confession
and
his
anger
thinking
only
of
phillis
seeing
only
her
ravished
by
her
gayety
her
vivacity
his
whole
being
stirred
by
the
tender
caresses
of
her
beautiful
dark
eyes
how
could
he
not
be
happy
with
this
delicious
woman
who
held
such
sway
over
him
and
who
loved
him
so
ardently
for
him
a
single
danger
henceforth
solitude
she
would
preserve
him
from
it
with
her
gayety
good
temper
courage
and
love
she
would
not
leave
him
to
his
thoughts
work
would
do
the
rest
after
the
question
of
furniture
was
decided
they
settled
that
of
the
marriage
ceremony
and
she
was
surprised
to
find
that
his
ideas
were
the
same
as
hers
she
decided
upon
her
toilet
a
silk
gown
as
simple
as
possible
and
she
would
make
it
herself
as
she
made
all
her
gowns
and
then
they
discussed
the
witnesses
have
no
friends
phillis
said
had
some
formerly
your
father
had
friends
and
am
no
longer
the
daughter
of
my
father
i
am
the
sister
of
my
brother
i
would
not
dare
to
ask
them
to
witness
my
is
just
because
you
are
the
sister
of
your
brother
that
they
can
not
refuse
you
it
would
be
cruelty
added
to
rudeness
cruelty
may
be
overlooked
but
rudeness
among
the
men
of
talent
who
was
your
best
friend
he
not
a
bohemian
a
drunkard
father
regarded
him
as
the
greatest
painter
of
our
time
the
most
is
not
a
question
of
talent
but
of
name
i
am
sure
that
he
is
not
even
decorated
your
father
had
other
friends
more
successful
more
commonplace
if
you
member
of
the
institute
the
academician
also
that
is
what
we
want
and
both
are
you
will
write
them
and
tell
them
who
i
am
assistant
professor
of
the
school
of
medicine
and
doctor
of
the
hospitals
i
promise
you
they
will
accept
i
will
ask
my
old
master
carbonneau
president
of
the
academy
of
medicine
and
claudet
the
ancient
minister
who
in
his
quality
of
deputy
of
my
department
could
not
decline
any
more
than
the
others
and
that
will
give
us
decorated
witnesses
which
will
look
well
in
the
it
was
not
only
in
the
newspapers
they
looked
well
but
also
in
the
church
of
des
batignolles
casparis
carbonneau
claudet
art
science
and
but
the
beauty
and
charm
of
the
bride
were
not
eclipsed
by
these
glorious
witnesses
she
entered
on
arm
proud
in
her
modesty
radiant
with
grace
while
the
priest
celebrated
mass
at
the
altar
outside
before
the
door
a
man
dressed
in
a
costume
of
chestnut
velvet
and
wearing
a
felt
hat
walked
up
and
down
smoking
a
pipe
it
was
the
count
de
brigard
whose
principles
forbade
him
to
enter
a
church
for
either
a
wedding
or
a
funeral
and
who
walked
up
and
down
on
the
sidewalk
with
his
disciples
waiting
to
congratulate
saniel
when
he
appeared
the
count
rushed
up
to
him
and
taking
his
hand
pressed
it
warmly
on
separating
him
from
his
wife
and
saying
is
good
it
is
noble
circumstances
made
this
marriage
without
them
it
would
not
have
taken
place
i
understand
and
i
excuse
it
i
do
more
i
applaud
it
my
dear
friend
you
are
a
and
as
it
was
wednesday
in
the
evening
at
he
publicly
expressed
his
approbation
which
in
the
conditions
in
which
it
had
been
offered
did
not
satisfy
his
conscience
we
have
assisted
at
a
grand
act
of
reparation
the
marriage
of
our
friend
saniel
to
the
sister
of
this
poor
boy
victim
of
an
injustice
that
cries
for
vengeance
one
evening
in
this
same
room
i
spoke
lightly
of
saniel
some
of
you
remember
perhaps
in
spite
of
the
time
that
has
passed
i
wish
to
make
this
public
reparation
to
him
he
has
shown
himself
a
man
of
duty
and
of
conscience
bravely
putting
himself
above
social
it
not
a
social
weakness
asked
glady
have
chosen
as
witnesses
of
this
act
of
reparation
persons
who
seem
to
have
been
selected
for
the
decorative
side
of
their
official
positions
irony
on
the
contrary
said
brigard
is
a
powerful
and
fruitful
lesson
which
makes
even
those
who
are
professional
defenders
concur
in
the
demolition
of
the
prejudiced
saniel
is
a
man
chapter
xl
phillis
is
surprised
the
sunday
following
her
marriage
phillis
experienced
a
surprise
on
which
she
reflected
a
long
time
without
finding
a
satisfactory
explanation
as
she
was
dressing
saniel
entered
her
room
are
you
going
to
do
he
asked
which
i
do
every
are
not
going
to
mass
she
looked
at
him
astonished
not
being
able
to
control
her
surprise
and
as
usual
when
she
appeared
to
wish
to
read
his
thoughts
he
showed
temper
what
way
is
my
question
extraordinary
is
not
exactly
the
usual
subject
of
your
thoughts
it
seems
to
may
become
so
especially
when
i
think
of
others
as
is
the
case
just
now
do
you
not
often
go
to
mass
i
well
you
can
go
if
you
wish
listen
to
what
i
have
to
say
to
you
i
have
not
forgotten
the
promise
you
made
to
respect
my
ideas
and
beliefs
i
wish
to
make
you
the
same
it
is
very
that
is
good
and
generous
seems
simple
to
will
go
at
at
once
it
is
not
eight
go
to
high
mass
it
is
more
fashionable
what
a
strange
word
in
his
mouth
it
was
not
out
of
respect
to
fashion
that
she
went
to
church
but
because
there
was
in
her
a
depth
of
religious
sentiment
and
of
piety
a
little
vague
perhaps
which
misfortunes
had
revived
will
go
to
high
mass
she
said
without
letting
it
appear
that
this
word
had
suggested
anything
to
her
and
continuing
her
dressing
you
going
to
wear
this
frock
he
asked
pointing
to
one
that
lay
on
a
chair
at
least
if
it
does
not
displease
find
it
rather
in
effect
it
was
of
extreme
simplicity
made
of
some
cheap
stuff
its
only
charm
being
an
originality
that
phillis
gave
it
on
making
it
herself
not
forget
he
continued
is
not
a
church
for
working
people
when
a
woman
is
as
charming
as
you
are
she
is
always
noticed
people
will
ask
who
you
are
right
i
will
wear
the
gown
i
wore
at
the
distribution
of
the
is
it
and
your
bonnet
will
you
not
instead
of
the
round
hat
the
first
impression
should
be
the
this
mixture
of
religious
and
worldly
things
was
surprising
in
him
had
she
not
understood
him
then
until
now
after
all
perhaps
it
was
only
an
exception
but
these
exactions
regarding
her
dress
were
repeated
although
before
her
marriage
phillis
had
only
crossed
path
she
knew
him
well
enough
to
know
that
he
was
entirely
given
up
to
work
without
thought
of
anything
else
and
she
believed
that
after
marriage
he
would
continue
to
work
in
the
same
way
not
caring
for
amusements
or
society
she
was
correct
about
his
work
but
not
so
regarding
society
a
short
time
after
their
marriage
the
minister
claudet
was
cured
opportunely
of
an
attack
of
facial
neuralgia
by
saniel
for
whom
he
conceived
a
great
friendship
he
invited
saniel
and
his
wife
to
all
his
reunions
and
fetes
and
saniel
accepted
all
his
invitations
at
first
her
wedding
gown
answered
very
well
but
it
would
not
do
always
it
had
to
be
trimmed
modified
three
or
four
toilets
made
of
one
gown
but
however
ingenious
phillis
might
be
in
arranging
several
yards
of
tulle
or
gauze
she
could
not
make
combinations
indefinitely
and
besides
they
did
not
please
saniel
they
were
too
simple
he
liked
lace
beads
flowers
something
shining
and
glittering
such
as
he
saw
other
women
wear
how
could
she
please
him
with
the
small
resources
at
her
disposal
in
her
household
expenses
she
was
as
economical
as
possible
joseph
was
dismissed
and
replaced
by
a
maid
who
did
all
the
work
the
table
was
extremely
simple
but
these
little
economies
saved
on
one
side
were
quickly
spent
on
the
other
in
toilets
and
carriages
when
she
expressed
a
wish
to
work
to
paint
menus
he
would
not
consent
and
when
she
insisted
he
became
angry
he
only
permitted
her
to
paint
pictures
as
she
had
formerly
painted
for
amusement
in
her
studio
she
might
do
so
now
if
trade
were
a
disgrace
art
might
be
honorable
if
she
had
talent
he
would
be
glad
of
it
and
if
she
should
sell
her
pictures
it
would
be
original
enough
to
cause
her
to
be
talked
about
the
salon
was
partly
transformed
into
a
studio
and
phillis
painted
several
little
pictures
which
without
having
any
pretensions
to
great
art
were
pleasing
and
painted
with
a
certain
dash
glorient
admired
them
and
made
a
buy
two
of
them
and
order
others
at
a
small
price
it
is
true
but
it
was
much
more
than
she
expected
with
the
courage
and
constancy
that
women
put
into
work
that
pleases
them
she
would
willingly
have
painted
from
morning
till
night
but
the
connections
that
saniel
had
made
did
not
leave
her
this
liberty
through
claudet
they
made
many
acquaintances
and
accepted
invitations
that
placed
her
under
social
obligations
so
that
almost
every
day
she
had
a
visit
to
pay
a
funeral
or
a
marriage
to
attend
besides
an
occasional
charity
fair
and
her
own
day
at
home
when
she
listened
for
three
hours
to
feminine
gossip
of
no
interest
to
her
as
for
him
what
pleasure
could
he
take
in
dressing
after
a
hard
work
to
go
to
a
reception
he
son
of
a
peasant
and
a
peasant
himself
in
so
many
ways
who
formerly
understood
nothing
of
fashionable
life
and
felt
only
contempt
for
it
finding
it
as
dull
as
it
was
ridiculous
she
tried
to
find
a
cause
for
this
change
and
when
lightly
in
a
roundabout
way
she
brought
him
to
explain
himself
she
could
only
draw
one
answer
from
him
which
was
no
answer
to
her
must
be
of
the
why
did
he
care
so
much
about
society
was
it
because
she
was
the
sister
of
a
criminal
that
he
wished
to
take
her
everywhere
and
make
people
receive
her
she
understood
this
up
to
a
certain
point
although
the
part
he
made
her
play
was
the
most
cruel
that
he
could
give
her
and
entirely
contrary
to
what
she
would
have
chosen
if
she
had
been
free
but
this
was
all
there
was
in
his
desire
to
be
of
the
world
because
he
had
married
her
he
was
not
the
brother
of
a
criminal
and
on
close
observation
it
might
be
seen
that
all
he
desired
of
these
persons
in
high
places
whom
he
sought
was
their
consideration
a
part
of
their
importance
and
honor
but
he
did
not
need
this
he
was
some
one
by
himself
the
position
that
he
had
made
was
worthy
of
his
merit
his
name
was
honored
his
future
was
envied
and
yet
as
if
he
did
not
realize
this
he
sought
small
satisfactions
unworthy
of
a
serious
ambition
one
evening
she
was
very
much
surprised
when
he
told
her
that
the
decoration
of
a
spanish
republic
was
offered
to
him
and
although
she
had
formed
a
habit
of
watching
over
her
words
she
could
not
help
exclaiming
will
you
do
with
that
could
not
refuse
not
only
had
he
not
refused
it
but
he
had
accepted
others
blue
green
yellow
and
tricolored
he
wore
them
in
his
buttonhole
around
his
neck
and
on
his
breast
what
good
could
those
decorations
do
that
belittled
him
and
how
could
a
man
of
his
merit
hasten
to
obtain
the
legion
of
honor
before
it
fell
to
him
naturally
all
this
was
astonishing
mysterious
and
silly
and
her
mind
dwelt
upon
it
when
she
was
alone
before
her
easel
while
near
her
in
his
laboratory
he
continued
his
experiments
or
wrote
an
article
in
his
office
for
the
review
but
it
was
not
without
a
struggle
that
she
permitted
herself
to
judge
him
in
this
way
one
does
not
judge
those
whom
one
loves
and
she
loved
him
was
it
not
failing
in
respect
to
her
love
that
she
did
not
admire
him
in
every
way
when
these
ideas
oppressed
her
she
left
her
easel
and
went
to
him
close
to
him
they
disappeared
at
first
in
order
not
to
disturb
him
she
entered
on
tiptoe
walking
softly
and
leaning
over
his
shoulder
embraced
him
before
he
saw
or
heard
her
but
he
betrayed
such
horror
such
fear
that
she
gave
up
this
way
of
greeting
him
she
continued
to
go
to
his
room
but
in
a
different
way
instead
of
surprising
him
she
announced
her
presence
by
rattling
the
handle
of
the
door
and
walking
noisily
and
instead
of
receiving
her
with
uneasy
manner
he
welcomed
her
joyfully
have
finished
painting
have
come
to
see
you
for
a
little
well
stay
with
me
do
not
go
away
immediately
i
am
never
so
happy
i
never
work
so
well
as
when
i
have
you
near
she
felt
that
this
was
true
when
she
was
with
him
whether
she
spoke
or
not
her
presence
made
him
happy
and
still
she
must
appear
not
to
look
at
him
too
attentively
as
if
with
the
manifest
intention
of
studying
him
for
she
did
this
during
the
first
days
of
their
marriage
and
angered
him
so
much
that
he
exclaimed
do
you
examine
me
thus
what
do
you
look
for
in
me
she
learned
to
watch
herself
carefully
and
when
with
him
to
preserve
a
discreet
attitude
that
should
not
offend
him
no
curious
looks
and
no
questions
but
this
was
not
always
easy
so
she
asked
leave
to
assist
him
in
his
work
and
sometimes
drew
in
larger
size
the
designs
that
he
made
for
his
microscopical
studies
in
this
way
the
time
passed
rapidly
if
he
were
but
willing
to
pass
the
evening
hours
in
this
sweet
intimacy
without
a
word
about
going
out
how
happy
she
would
be
but
he
never
forgot
the
hour
he
said
interrupting
himself
must
she
had
never
dared
to
ask
the
true
reason
for
this
chapter
xli
a
troubled
soul
if
she
dared
not
frankly
ask
him
this
question
why
must
we
go
out
any
more
than
the
others
why
is
it
proper
that
i
should
go
to
mass
to
be
seen
why
should
i
wear
gowns
that
ruin
us
why
do
you
accept
decorations
that
are
valueless
in
your
eyes
why
do
you
seek
the
society
of
men
who
have
no
merit
but
what
they
derive
from
their
official
position
or
from
their
fortune
why
do
we
take
upon
ourselves
social
duties
that
weary
both
of
us
instead
of
remaining
together
in
a
tender
and
intelligent
intimacy
that
is
sweet
to
us
both
she
could
not
ask
herself
they
all
appertained
to
this
order
of
ideas
that
she
without
doubt
found
explained
them
disposition
of
character
the
exactions
of
an
ambition
in
haste
to
realize
its
desires
susceptibility
or
overshadowing
pride
but
there
were
others
founded
on
observation
or
memory
having
no
connection
with
those
or
so
it
seemed
to
her
she
began
to
know
her
husband
the
day
following
their
marriage
having
believed
that
he
was
always
such
as
he
revealed
himself
to
her
but
this
was
not
the
case
and
the
man
she
had
loved
was
so
unlike
the
man
whose
wife
she
had
become
that
it
might
almost
be
thought
there
were
two
to
tell
the
truth
it
was
not
marriage
that
made
the
change
in
his
temper
that
distressed
her
but
it
was
not
less
characteristic
by
that
that
it
dated
back
to
a
period
anterior
to
this
marriage
she
remembered
the
commencement
with
a
clearness
that
left
no
place
for
doubt
or
hesitation
it
was
at
the
time
when
pursued
by
creditors
he
entered
into
relations
with
caffie
for
the
first
time
he
always
so
strong
that
she
believed
him
above
weakness
had
had
a
moment
of
discouragement
on
announcing
that
he
would
probably
be
obliged
to
leave
paris
but
this
depression
had
neither
the
anger
nor
weakness
that
he
had
since
shown
it
was
the
natural
sadness
of
a
man
who
saw
his
future
destroyed
nothing
more
the
only
surprise
that
she
then
felt
was
caused
by
the
idea
of
strangling
caffie
and
taking
enough
money
from
his
safe
to
clear
himself
from
debt
and
also
because
he
said
as
a
consequence
of
this
act
speaking
of
the
remorse
of
an
intelligent
man
that
his
conscience
would
not
reproach
him
since
for
him
conscience
did
not
exist
but
this
was
evidently
a
simple
philosophical
theory
not
a
trait
of
character
a
jest
or
an
argument
for
the
sake
of
discussion
relieved
from
his
creditors
with
the
money
won
at
monaco
he
returned
to
his
usual
calm
working
harder
than
ever
passing
his
and
when
it
seemed
excusable
that
he
might
be
nervous
violent
unjust
he
remained
the
man
that
he
had
been
ever
since
she
knew
him
then
all
at
once
a
short
time
before
florlentin
went
to
the
assizes
occurred
these
strange
explosions
of
temper
spasms
of
anger
and
restlessness
that
she
could
not
explain
manifesting
themselves
exactly
at
the
time
when
by
madame
intervention
she
hoped
florentin
would
be
saved
she
had
not
forgotten
the
furious
anger
that
was
inexplicable
and
unjustifiable
with
which
he
refused
her
request
to
see
madame
dammauville
he
had
thrust
her
away
wishing
to
break
with
her
and
until
she
was
a
witness
of
this
scene
she
never
imagined
that
any
one
could
put
such
violence
into
exasperation
then
to
this
scene
succeeded
another
totally
opposed
which
had
not
less
impressed
her
when
at
their
little
dinner
by
the
fire
he
showed
such
profound
desolation
on
telling
her
to
keep
the
memory
of
this
evening
when
she
should
judge
him
and
announcing
to
her
in
a
prophetic
sort
of
way
that
the
hour
would
come
when
she
would
know
him
whom
she
loved
and
now
this
hour
the
thought
of
which
she
had
thrown
far
from
her
had
sounded
she
sought
to
combine
the
elements
of
this
judgment
which
then
appeared
criminal
to
her
and
now
forced
itself
upon
her
whatever
she
might
do
to
repel
it
how
many
times
this
memory
returned
to
her
it
could
almost
be
said
that
it
had
never
left
her
sweet
and
sad
at
the
same
time
less
sweet
and
more
sad
according
as
new
subjects
for
uneasiness
were
added
to
the
others
in
deepening
the
mysterious
and
troublous
impression
that
it
left
with
her
to
judge
him
why
did
he
wish
that
she
should
judge
him
and
on
what
and
yet
with
him
it
was
not
an
insignificant
word
but
the
evidence
of
a
particular
state
of
conscience
which
many
times
since
asserted
itself
was
it
not
in
effect
to
this
order
of
ideas
that
the
cry
belonged
that
escaped
him
in
the
night
when
waking
suddenly
he
asked
with
emotion
with
fright
have
i
said
and
also
to
the
same
appertained
the
anger
that
carried
him
away
when
of
their
religious
marriage
she
spoke
of
confession
do
you
think
that
i
should
be
afraid
to
go
to
confession
how
could
he
imagine
that
she
could
admit
the
idea
of
fear
in
connection
with
him
the
idea
never
occurred
to
her
mind
until
this
moment
and
if
now
the
memory
of
her
astonishment
came
to
her
it
was
because
of
other
little
things
added
to
those
of
the
past
that
evoked
it
how
numerous
and
significant
they
were
these
things
his
constant
uneasiness
on
seeing
himself
watched
by
her
his
invitation
when
he
thought
she
was
going
to
question
him
his
access
of
passion
when
through
heedlessness
or
forgetfulness
or
simply
by
chance
she
asked
him
a
question
on
certain
subjects
and
immediately
the
tenderness
that
followed
so
sudden
that
they
appeared
rather
planned
in
view
of
a
determined
end
than
natural
or
spontaneous
it
was
a
long
time
before
she
admitted
the
calculation
under
the
sweet
words
that
made
her
so
happy
but
in
the
end
it
was
well
that
she
should
open
her
eyes
to
the
evidence
and
see
that
they
were
with
him
the
consequences
of
the
same
and
constant
preoccupation
that
of
not
committing
himself
it
was
only
one
step
from
this
to
ask
him
what
he
did
not
wish
to
yield
up
yet
as
short
as
it
was
she
resisted
for
a
long
time
the
curiosity
that
possessed
her
it
was
her
duty
as
a
loving
and
devoted
wife
not
to
seek
beyond
what
he
showed
her
and
this
duty
was
in
perfect
accord
with
the
dispositions
of
her
love
but
the
power
of
things
seen
carried
her
beyond
will
and
reason
she
could
not
apply
her
mind
to
search
for
that
which
agonized
her
and
she
could
not
close
her
eyes
and
ears
to
what
she
saw
and
heard
and
what
struck
them
were
the
same
observations
turning
always
in
the
same
circle
applied
to
the
same
subjects
and
persons
name
irritated
him
madame
angered
him
made
him
positively
unhappy
as
for
the
two
former
she
might
have
prevented
the
pronunciation
of
them
when
she
saw
the
effect
they
infallibly
produced
on
him
but
she
could
not
prevent
the
utterance
of
name
even
had
she
wished
it
how
could
she
tell
her
mother
never
to
speak
the
name
of
him
who
was
constantly
in
their
thoughts
in
spite
of
efforts
and
solicitations
supported
by
florentin
had
embarked
for
new
caledonia
whence
he
wrote
as
often
as
he
could
his
letters
related
all
his
sufferings
in
the
terrible
galleys
where
he
was
confined
during
the
voyage
and
since
his
arrival
they
were
a
series
of
long
complaints
continued
from
one
to
the
other
like
a
story
without
end
turning
always
on
the
same
subject
his
physical
sufferings
his
humiliation
his
discouragement
and
his
disgust
in
the
midst
of
the
unfortunates
whose
companion
he
was
the
arrival
of
these
letters
filled
the
mother
and
sister
with
anguish
that
lasted
for
several
days
and
this
anguish
that
neither
of
them
could
dissimulate
angered
saniel
would
you
do
if
he
were
dead
he
asked
phillis
it
not
be
better
for
him
he
will
what
condition
we
the
masters
of
fate
weep
we
do
not
but
he
complained
of
the
weeping
faces
that
surrounded
him
the
tears
they
concealed
from
him
the
sighs
they
stifled
ordinarily
he
was
tender
and
affectionate
to
his
with
attention
and
deference
which
in
some
ways
seemed
affected
as
if
he
were
so
by
will
rather
than
by
natural
sentiment
but
at
these
times
he
forgot
this
tenderness
and
treated
her
with
hardness
so
unjust
that
more
than
once
madame
cormier
spoke
of
it
to
her
daughter
can
your
husband
who
is
so
good
to
me
be
so
merciless
regarding
florentin
one
would
say
that
our
sadness
produces
on
him
the
effect
of
a
reproach
that
we
would
address
to
one
day
when
things
had
gone
farther
than
usual
she
had
the
courage
to
speak
to
him
plainly
me
for
burdening
you
with
the
weariness
of
our
disgrace
she
said
to
him
i
complain
of
everything
of
men
and
things
you
should
remember
that
you
are
the
exception
you
who
have
done
everything
to
save
but
these
few
words
which
she
believed
would
calm
the
irritation
of
her
had
on
the
contrary
exasperated
him
he
left
her
furious
do
not
understand
your
husband
at
all
she
said
to
her
daughter
you
not
explain
to
me
what
the
matter
is
with
him
how
could
she
give
her
mother
the
explanation
that
she
could
not
give
herself
having
reached
an
unfathomable
abyss
she
dared
not
even
lean
over
to
look
into
its
depths
and
instead
of
going
on
in
the
path
where
she
was
pledged
in
spite
of
herself
she
made
every
effort
to
return
or
at
least
to
stop
what
good
would
it
do
to
find
out
why
he
was
so
peculiar
and
what
it
was
that
he
took
so
much
pains
to
conceal
this
could
only
be
idle
curiosity
on
her
part
for
which
she
would
be
punished
sooner
or
later
turning
these
thoughts
over
continually
in
her
mind
she
lost
her
gayety
her
power
to
resist
blows
of
fate
such
as
the
small
trials
of
life
which
formerly
made
her
courageous
her
vigorous
elasticity
sunk
under
the
heavy
weight
with
which
it
was
charged
and
her
smiling
eyes
now
more
often
expressed
anxiety
than
happiness
and
confidence
in
spite
of
her
watchfulness
over
herself
she
was
not
able
to
hide
the
change
from
saniel
for
it
manifested
itself
in
everything
in
her
face
formerly
so
open
but
which
now
bore
the
imprint
of
a
secret
sadness
in
her
concentrated
manner
in
her
silence
and
abstraction
what
was
the
matter
with
her
he
questioned
her
and
she
replied
with
the
prudence
that
she
used
in
all
her
conversation
with
him
he
examined
her
medically
but
found
nothing
to
indicate
a
sickly
condition
which
would
justify
the
change
in
her
if
she
did
not
wish
to
answer
his
questions
and
he
had
the
proof
that
she
did
not
wish
to
if
on
the
other
hand
she
was
not
ill
and
he
was
convinced
that
she
was
not

must
be
something
serious
the
matter
to
make
the
woman

but
lately

easily

made

the

the

calm
that
saniel
had
felt
since
his
marriage
he
owed
to

the
strength

the
peace
that

drew
from
her

without
confidence
without

such
as
she
was
now
could
not
give
him
what
she
no
longer
had
herself
and
he
returned
to
the
distracted
condition
that
preceded
his
marriage
and
felt
the
same
anguish
the
same
agitation
the
same
madness
the
beautiful
relations
worldly
consideration
success
decorations
honors
were
good
for
others
but
for
his
happiness
he
required
the
tranquillity
and
serenity
of
his
wife
and
her
good
moral
health
which
passed
into
him
when
she
slept
on
his
shoulder
in
that
case
there
were
no
sudden
awakenings
no
sleeplessness
at
the
sound
of
her
gentle
respiration
he
was
reassured
and
the
spectres
remained
in
their
tomb
but
now
that
this
respiration
was
agitated
and
he
no
longer
felt
in
her
this
tranquillity
and
serenity
he
was
no
longer

she
was
weak
and
uneasy
and
she
communicated
her
fever

not
sleep
why
do
you
not
sleep
you
he
must
know
he
persisted
in
his
questions
but
she
was
always
on
her
guard
so
that
he
was
unable
to
draw
anything
from
her
checked
as
he
was
by
the
fear
of
betraying
himself
which
seemed
easy
at
the
point
he
believed
she
had
reached
an
awkward
word
too
much
persistence
would
let
a
flood
of
light
into
her
mind
he
also
affected
to
speak
as
a
physician
when
questioning
her
and
to
look
for
medical
explanations
of
her
condition
you
do
not
sleep
it
is
because
you
suffer
what
is
this
suffering
from
what
does
it
proceed
having
no
reasons
to
give
to
justify
it
since
she
did
not
even
dare
to
speak
of
her
brother
she
denied
it
obstinately
nothing
is
the

me

terrible
that

that
she
cried
they
looked
at
each

for
a
few
moments
in
silence
both
equally
frightened
she
at
the
threat
he
at
what
he
would
learn
from
her
but
to
show
this
fright
was
on
his
side
to
let
loose
another
proof
even
more
grave
should
i
not
seek
to
discover
in

way
the
cause

uneasiness

believed
that

opened

door
of

i
am
too
much
afraid
if
you
ever
want
to

somnambulism

of

in

you

was
certain
he
would
not

dangerous
questions

understood
that

wished

him

asked

shall
ask
you
questions
about

he
could
not
press
it
without
showing
the
importance
that
he
attached
to
it
do
not
insist
he
said
is
a
way
like
any
other
but
better
you
do
not
wish
it
and
we
will
not
talk
of
but
he
yielded
too
quickly
for
her
to
hope
that
he
renounced
his
project
and
she
remained
under
the
influence
of
a
stupefying
terror
what
would
she
say
if
he
made
her
talk
everything
possibly
she
did
not
even
know
what
thoughts
were
hidden
in
the
depths
of
her
brain
and
she
knew
absolutely
nothing
of
this
forced
somnambulism
with
which
she
was
threatened
at
this
time
the
works
of
the
school
of
nancy
on
sleep
hypnotism
and
suggestion
had
not
yet
been
published
or
at
least
the
book
which
served
as
their
was
not
known
and
she
knew
nothing
of
processes
that
were
employed
to
provoke
the
hypnotic
sleep
as
soon
as
her
husband
left
the
house
she
looked
for
some
book
in
the
library
that
would
enlighten
her
but
the
dictionary
that
she
found
gave
only
obscure
or
confused
instructions
in
which
she
floundered
the
only
exact
point
that
struck
her
was
the
method
employed
to
produce
sleep
to
make
the
subject
look
at
a
brilliant
object
placed
from
fifteen
to
twenty
centimetres
in
front
of
the
eyes
if
this
were
true
she
had
no
fear
of
ever
being
put
to
sleep
however
she
was
not
reassured
and
when
a
few
days
later
at
a
dinner
she
found
herself
seated
next
to
one
of
her
who
she
knew
interested
himself
in
somnambulism
she
had
the
courage
to
conquer
her
usual
timidity
concerning
medicine
and
questioned
him
there
not
persons
with
certain
diseases
who
can
be
put
into
a
state
of
somnambulism
was
formerly
believed
by
the
public
and
by
many
physicians
that
only
persons
afflicted
with
hysteria
and
nervous
troubles
could
be
put
to
sleep
in
this
way
but
it
was
a
mistake
artificial
somnambulism
may
be
produced
on
many
subjects
who
are
perfectly
the
will
preserved
in
sleep
subject
only
preserves
the
spontaneity
and
will
that
his
hypnotizer
leaves
him
who
at
his
pleasure
makes
him
sad
gay
angry
or
tender
and
plays
with
his
soul
as
with
an
that
is
at
least
it
is
certain
that
there
is
a
local
paralysis
of
such
or
such
a
cell
the
study
of
which
is
the
of
many
interesting
he
wakes
does
the
subject
remember
what
he
has
said
is
a
difference
of
opinion
on
this
point
some
say
yes
and
others
no
as
for
me
i
believe
the
memory
depends
upon
the
degree
of
sleep
with
a
light
sleep
there
is
remembrance
but
with
a
profound
sleep
the
subject
does
not
remember
what
he
has
said
or
heard
or
she
would
have
liked
to
continue
and
her
companion
glad
to
talk
of
what
interested
him
would
willingly
have
said
more
but
she
saw
her
husband
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
watching
them
by
fits
and
starts
and
fearing
that
he
would
suspect
the
subject
of
their
conversation
she
remained
silent
what
she
had
just
learned
seemed
to
her
frightful
but
at
least
as
she
would
not
let
herself
be
hypnotized
she
had
nothing
to
fear
and
remembering
what
she
had
read
she
promised
herself
that
she
would
never
let
him
place
her
in
a
position
where
he
could
put
her
to
sleep
it
was
during
the
sleep
that
the
will
of
the
hypnotizer
controlled
that
of
the
subject
not
before
resting
on
this
belief
and
also
on
his
not
having
again
spoken
of
sending
her
to
sleep
she
was
reassured
was
not
this
a
sign
that
he
accepted
her
opposition
and
renounced
his
idea
of
provoked
somnambulism
but
she
deceived
herself
one
night
when
she
had
gone
to
bed
at
her
usual
hour
while
he
remained
at
his
work
she
awoke
suddenly
and
saw
him
standing
near
her
looking
at
her
with
eyes
whose
fixed
stare
frightened
her
is
the
matter
what
do
you
want
i
want
nothing
i
am
going
to
in
spite
of
the
strangeness
of
his
glance
she
did
not
persist
questions
would
have
taught
her
nothing
and
besides
now
that
he
no
longer
went
to
bed
at
the
same
time
as
she
did
there
was
nothing
extraordinary
in
his
attitude
but
a
few
days
from
that
she
woke
again
in
the
night
with
a
feeling
of
distress
and
saw
him
leaning
over
her
as
if
he
would
envelop
her
in
his
arms
this
time
frightened
as
she
was
she
had
the
strength
to
say
nothing
but
her
anguish
was
the
more
intense
did
he
then
wish
to
hypnotize
her
while
she
slept
was
it
possible
then
the
dictionary
had
deceived
her
in
truth
it
was
while
she
slept
that
saniel
tried
to
transform
her
natural
into
an
artificial
sleep
would
he
succeed
he
knew
nothing
about
it
for
the
experience
was
new
but
he
risked
it
the
first
time
instead
of
putting
her
into
a
state
of
somnambulism
he
awoke
her
the
second
he
succeeded
no
better
the
third
when
he
saw
that
after
a
certain
time
she
did
not
open
her
eyes
he
supposed
that
she
was
asleep
to
assure
himself
he
raised
her
arm
which
remained
in
the
air
until
he
placed
it
on
the
bed
then
taking
her
two
hands
he
turned
them
backward
and
withdrawing
his
own
the
impulsion
which
he
gave
lasted
until
he
checked
it
her
face
had
an
expression
of
calmness
and
tranquillity
that
it
had
not
had
for
a
long
time
she
was
the
pretty
phillis
of
other
days
with
the
sprightly
glance
i
will
make
you
sleep
at
the
same
time
he
said
you
will
the
next
night
he
put
her
to
sleep
even
more
easily
but
when
he
questioned
her
she
resisted
she
said
will
not
speak
it
is
horrible
i
will
not
i
can
not
he
insisted
but
she
would
not
well
so
be
it
he
said
but
i
wish
you
to
speak
and
you
shall
not
resist
me
i
will
it
if
he
did
not
insist
it
was
not
only
because
he
knew
that
habit
was
necessary
to
make
her
submit
to
his
will
without
being
able
to
defend
herself
but
because
he
was
ignorant
whether
when
she
awoke
she
had
any
memory
of
what
happened
in
her
sleep
which
was
an
important
point
the
next
night
she
was
the
same
as
she
had
been
the
previous
evening
and
nothing
indicated
that
she
was
conscious
of
her
provoked
sleep
any
more
than
what
she
said
in
this
sleep
he
could
then
continue
this
time
she
went
to
sleep
sooner
and
more
easily
than
usual
and
her
face
took
the
expression
of
tranquillity
and
repose
he
had
seen
the
night
before
would
she
answer
and
if
she
consented
would
she
speak
sincerely
without
attempting
to
weaken
or
falsify
the
truth
emotion
made
his
voice
tremble
when
he
put
the
first
question
it
was
his
life
his
peace
the
happiness
of
both
which
decided
him
do
you
suffer
he
asked
do
not
you
are
agitated
often
melancholy
or
uneasy
you
do
not
sleep
well
what
troubles
you
am
of
what
of
whom
you
he
trembled
of
me
do
you
think
that
i
could
hurt
you
his
tightened
heart
relaxed
why
are
you
afraid
there
are
things
in
you
that
frighten
things

that
has
taken
place
in
your
temper
your
character
and
your
how
do
these
changes

you
uneasy

a
serious
situation
do
not
know
i
have
never
stated
not
i
was
afraid
and
i
closed
my
eyes
so
that
i
might
not
what
explanation
of
all
that
is
mysterious
in
your
did
you
notice
the
mystery
in
my
life
the
time
of
death
and
before
when
you
told
me
that
you
could
kill
him
without
any
you
know
who
killed
caffie
his
relief
was
so
great
that
for
several
moments
he
forgot
to
continue
his
interrogations
then
he
went
on
after
little
before
madame
death
when
you
became
irritable
and
furious
without
cause
when
you
told
me
to
go
because
you
did
not
wish
to
see
madame
dammauville
when
the
night
before
her
death
you
were
so
tender
and
asked
me
not
to
judge
you
without
recalling
that
you
have
judged
when
worry
urged
me
my
love
checked
provoked
this
uneasiness
outside
of
these
facts
manner
of
living

our
marriage
your
accesses
of
anger
and
of

your
agitation

night
your
complaints

he
cried
distinctly
you

often
and
moan
pronouncing
broken
words
without
sense
unintelligible
his
anguish
was
violent
when
he
recovered
he
continued

in

way
of
living
that
has
made
you
uneasy

names

chapter
xliii
the
terrible
revelation
this
confession
threw
him
into
a
state
of
confusion
and
agitation
for
if
it
did
not
go
beyond
what
he
feared
yet
it
revealed
a
terrible
situation
clearly
as
in
an
open
book
he
read
her
if
she
did
not
know
all
she
was
but
one
step
from
the
truth
and
if
she
had
not
taken
this
step
it
was
because
her
love
restrained
her
if
her
love
had
been
less
strong
less
powerful
she
certainly
would
not
have
withstood
the
proofs
that
pressed
on
her
from
all
sides
but
because
she
had
held
back
so
long
he
must
not
conclude
that
the
struggle
would
be
continued
in
this
way
and
that
a
more
violent
blow
a
stronger
proof
than
the
others
would
not
open
her
eyes
in
spite
of
herself
it
only
needed
an
imprudence
a
carelessness
on
his
part
and
unluckily
he
could
no
longer
be
relied
on
from
what
he
had
just
learned
it
would
be
easy
to
watch
himself
closely
and
to
avoid
dangerous
subjects
those
that
she
described
to
him
but
if
he
could
guard
his
words
and
looks
during
the
day
neither
saying
nor
letting
anything
appear
that
was
an
accusation
not
confirming
the
suspicions
against
which
she
struggled
he
could
not
do
it
at
night
he
had
not
talked
and
when
she
answered
negatively
to
his
question
she
lifted
a
terribly
heavy
weight
from
his
heart
but
he
had
groaned
and
moaned
he
had
pronounced
broken
words
without
sense
and
unintelligible
and
there
was
the
danger
what
was
necessary
to
make
these
sighs
these
groans
these
broken
and
unintelligible
words
become
distinct
and
take
a
meaning
a
nothing
an
accident
since
his
real
cerebral
tendency
placed
him
up
to
a
certain
point
in
a
somnambulistic
state
was
this
tendency
congenital
with
him
or
acquired
he
did
not
know
before
the
agitated
nights
after
madame
death
and
condemnation
the
idea
had
never
occurred
to
him
that
he
might
talk
in
his
sleep
but
now
he
had
the
proof
that
the
vague
fears
which
had
tormented
him
on
this
subject
were
only
too
well
founded
he
had
talked
and
if
the
words
that
escaped
were
not
now
comprehensible
they
might
become
so
without
having
made
a
special
study
of
sleep
natural
or
induced
he
knew
that
in
the
case
of
natural
somnambulists
a
hypnotic
sleep
is
easily
produced
and
that
while
holding
a
conversation
with
a
subject
who
talks
in
his
sleep
one
may
readily
hypnotize
him
without
doubt
he
need
not
fear
this
from
phillis
but
it
was
possible
that
some
night
when
incoherent
words
escaped
him
she
would
not
be
able
to
resist
the
temptation
to
enter
into
a
conversation
with
him
and
to
lead
him
to
confess
what
she
wished
to
know
what
the
love
that
she
felt
for
her
brother
would
drive
her
to
wish
to
learn
if
this
opportunity
presented
itself
would
the
love
for
her
brother
or
for
her
husband
carry
her
away
if
she
questioned
him
what
would
he
not
say
for
the
first
time
he
asked
himself
if
he
had
done
right
to
marry
and
if
on
the
contrary
he
had
not
committed
a
mad
imprudence
in
introducing
a
woman
into
a
life
so
tormented
as
his
he
had
asked
calmness
from
this
woman
and
now
she
brought
him
terror
to
tell
the
truth
she
was
dangerous
only
at
night
and
if
he
found
a
way
to
occupy
another
room
he
would
have
nothing
to
fear
from
her
during
the
day
on
condition
that
he
held
himself
rigorously
on
the
defensive
loving
him
as
she
did
she
would
resist
the
curiosity
that
drew
her
if
uneasiness
drove
her
her
love
would
restrain
her
as
she
herself
had
said
little
by
little
this
uneasiness
and
curiosity
being
no
longer
excited
would
die
out
and
they
would
again
enjoy
the
sweet
days
that
followed
their
marriage
but
in
the
present
circumstances
this
way
was
difficult
to
find
for
to
propose
another
room
to
phillis
would
be
equal
to
telling
her
that
he
was
afraid
of
her
and
consequently
it
would
give
her
a
new
mystery
to
study
he
reflected
and
starting
with
the
idea
that
the
proposition
of
two
rooms
must
come
from
phillis
he
arranged
a
plan
which
it
seemed
to
him
would
accomplish
what
he
wished
ignorant
of
the
fact
that
she
had
been
hypnotized
and
not
remembering
that
she
had
talked
without
doubt
phillis
still
feared
that
he
would
hypnotize
her
he
would
threaten
it
again
and
surely
she
would
find
a
way
to
defend
herself
and
escape
from
him
this
is
what
happened
the
next
day
when
he
told
her
decidedly
that
he
wished
to
put
her
to
sleep
in
order
that
he
might
learn
what
troubled
her
she
showed
the
same
fright
as
on
the
first
time
that
you
have
asked
of
me
everything
that
you
have
desired
i
have
wished
as
you
and
with
you
but
i
will
never
consent
to
resistance
is
absurd
i
will
not
yield
to
shall
not
put
me
to
sleep
against
my
is
not
without
replying
he
took
a
book
from
the
library
and
turning
over
the
leaves
he
read
it
possible
to
make
a
sleeping
person
without
awaking
him
pass
from
the
natural
to
the
hypnotic
sleep
the
thing
is
possible
at
least
with
certain
then
handing
her
the
book
see
that
to
put
you
to
sleep
artificially
i
need
only
the
opportunity
of
finding
you
sleeping
naturally
it
is
very
would
be
are
merely
he
threw
her
into
such
a
state
of
terror
that
she
kept
awake
all
night
and
as
he
would
not
sleep
for
fear
of
talking
he
felt
that
she
exerted
every
faculty
to
keep
awake
but
had
he
not
gone
too
far
and
by
this
threat
would
he
not
drive
her
to
some
desperate
act
if
she
should
escape
if
she
deserted
him
what
would
become
of
him
without
her
was
she
not
his
whole
life
but
he
reassured
himself
by
saying
that
she
loved
him
too
much
ever
to
consent
to
a
separation
without
doubt
she
herself
would
come
to
think
as
he
wished
her
to
think
and
yet
when
he
returned
home
in
the
evening
she
told
him
that
her
mother
was
not
well
and
begged
him
to
examine
her
this
examination
proved
that
madame
cormier
was
in
her
usual
health
but
she
complained
that
her
breath
failed
her
during
the
day
she
had
feared
syncope
you
are
willing
phillis
said
will
sleep
near
mamma
i
am
afraid
of
not
hearing
her
at
night
and
she
is
he
began
by
refusing
then
he
consented
to
this
arrangement
and
to
thank
him
for
it
she
stayed
with
him
in
his
office
affectionate
full
of
tenderness
and
caresses
until
he
went
to
his
room
he
was
then
free
to
sleep
or
not
whether
he
groaned
or
talked
she
could
not
hear
him
since
there
was
no
communicating
door
between
his
room
and
that
of
his
his
voice
certainly
would
not
penetrate
the
partition
who
could
have
told
him
on
the
night
that
he
decided
to
marry
that
he
would
come
to
such
a
pass
to
be
afraid
to
hide
himself
from
her
who
brought
him
the
calmness
of
sleep
and
that
by
his
fault
by
a
chain
of
imprudences
and
stupidities
as
if
it
were
written
that
in
everything
he
would
owe
his
sufferings
to
himself
and
that
if
he
ever
succumbed
to
the
whirlwind
that
swept
him
along
it
would
be
by
his
own
deed
by
his
own
hand
at
last
he
had
assured
the
tranquillity
of
his
nights
and
as
a
further
precaution
although
he
did
not
fear
that
phillis
would
enter
his
room
while
he
slept
to
surprise
him
she
who
dared
not
look
in
the
face
what
suspicion
showed
her
he
locked
his
door
naturally
phillis
could
not
always
sleep
with
her
mother
but
he
would
find
a
way
to
suggest
frankly
their
sleeping
apart
and
surely
he
could
find
one
in
the
storehouse
of
medicine
these
cares
and
similar
fears
were
not
of
a
nature
to
dispose
him
to
sleep
and
besides
for
a
long
time
he
had
suffered
from
an
exasperating
nervous
insomnia
as
the
night
was
warm
he
thought
a
little
fresh
air
would
calm
him
and
he
opened
the
window
if
this
freshness
did
not
calm
him
at
least
it
would
make
him
sleep
obliged
to
improvise
a
bed
in
her
room
phillis
placed
it
against
the
partition
that
separated
her
from
her
husband
but
without
preconcerted
intention
simply
by
accident
because
it
was
the
only
place
where
she
could
put
the
bed
a
little
after
midnight
an
unusual
noise
awoke
her
she
sat
up
to
listen
and
to
recover
herself
it
seemed
as
if
this
noise
came
from
her
room
alarmed
she
placed
her
ear
against
the
partition
she
was
not
deceived
they
were
stifled
groans
moans
that
were
repeated
at
short
intervals
carefully
yet
quickly
she
left
her
bed
and
as
the
dawn
was
already
shining
in
the
windows
she
was
able
to
leave
the
room
without
making
any
noise
reaching
the
door
of
her
room
she
listened
she
was
not
deceived
they
were
indeed
groans
but
louder
and
sadder
than
those
she
had
so
often
heard
during
the
night
she
tried
the
door
but
it
was
evidently
locked
on
the
inside
what
was
the
matter
with
him
she
must
know
must
go
to
him
and
give
him
relief
she
thought
of
knocking
of
shaking
the
door
but
as
he
did
not
reply
when
she
tried
to
open
it
it
was
because
he
did
not
hear
or
did
not
wish
to
hear
then
she
thought
of
the
terrace
from
there
she
could
see
what
happened
and
if
it
were
necessary
she
would
break
a
pane
to
enter
she
found
the
window
open
and
saw
her
husband
on
the
bed
sleeping
his
head
turned
toward
her
she
stopped
and
asked
herself
if
she
should
cross
the
threshold
and
wake
him
at
this
moment
with
closed
lips
he
pronounced
several
words
more
distinctly
than
those
that
had
so
many
times
escaped
him
he
dreamed
of
her
poor
dear
victor
for
what
did
he
wish
her
to
pardon
him
doubtless
for
having
threatened
to
hypnotize
her
overcome
by
this
proof
of
love
she
put
her
head
through
the
opening
of
the
window
to
give
him
a
look
before
returning
to
her
mother
but
on
seeing
his
face
in
the
full
white
light
of
the
morning
she
was
frightened
it
expressed
the
most
violent
sorrow
the
features
convulsed
with
anguish
and
horror
at
the
same
time
surely
he
was
she
must
wake
him
just
as
she
took
a
step
toward
him
he
began
to
speak
brother
or
me
she
stopped
as
if
thunderstruck
then
instinctively
she
drew
back
and
clung
to
the
window
in
the
vestibule
to
keep
herself
from
falling
repeating
those
two
words
that
she
had
just
heard
not
understanding
not
wishing
to
understand
instead
of
returning
to
her
mother
trembling
and
holding
on
to
the
wall
she
entered
the
parlor
and
let
herself
fall
into
a
chair
prostrated
crushed
brother
or
me
this
was
then
the
truth
the
frightful
truth
that
she
had
never
wished
to
see
she
stayed
there
until
the
noises
in
the
street
warned
her
that
it
was
getting
late
and
she
might
be
surprised
then
she
returned
to
her
mother
am
going
out
she
said
will
return
at
eight
or
nine
your
husband
will
not
see
you
before
going
to
the
will
tell
him
that
i
have
gone
she
returned
at
nine
madame
cormier
had
finished
dressing
last
you
have
come
she
said
but
at
sight
of
her
face
she
saw
that
something
had
happened
god
what
is
the
matter
she
asked
trembling
serious
very
serious
but
unfortunately
it
is
irreparable
we
must
leave
here
never
to
husband
must
never
speak
to
me
of
him
this
the
only
thing
i
ask
of
i
understand
it
is
what
i
foresaw
what
i
said
would
happen
you
can
not
bear
the
contempt
that
he
shows
us
on
account
of
your
must
hereafter
be
strangers
to
each
other
and
this
is
why
we
leave
this
god
at
my
age
to
drag
my
bones
have
engaged
a
lodging
at
the
ternes
a
wagon
will
come
to
take
the
furniture
that
belongs
to
us
what
we
brought
here
only
that
we
will
tell
the
concierge
that
we
are
going
to
the
country

day

present
before

shall
have
painted
and
sold
another
do
not
worry
we
shall
have
all
we
all
this
was
said
in
a
hard
but
resolute
tone
a
ring
of
the
bell
interrupted
them
it
was
the
express
wagon
that
they
do
not
take
what
does
not
belong
to
us
phillis
said
they
fill
their
wagon
i
will
write
in
the
at
the
end
of
an
hour
the
wagon
was
ready
madame
cormier
entered
the
parlor
to
tell
her
daughter
have
finished
phillis
said
having
placed
her
letter
in
an
envelope
she
laid
it
in
full
view
on
desk
let
us
go
she
said
and
as
her
mother
sighed
while
walking
with
difficulty
on
me
dear
mamma
you
know
i
am
chapter
xliv
after
long
years
saniel
did
not
return
until
quite
late
in
the
afternoon
when
he
opened
the
door
with
his
key
he
was
surprised
at
not
seeing
his
wife
run
to
him
and
kiss
him
is
painting
he
said
to
himself
did
not
hear
he
passed
into
the
parlor
convinced
that
he
would
find
her
at
her
easel
but
he
did
not
see
her
and
the
easel
was
not
in
its
usual
place
there
nor
anywhere
else
he
knocked
at
the
door
of
madame
room
there
was
no
reply
he
knocked
louder
a
second
time
and
after
waiting
a
moment
he
entered
the
room
was
empty
there
was
no
bed
no
furniture
no
one
stupefied
he
looked
around
him
then
returning
to
the
vestibule
he
called
phillis
there
was
no
reply
he
ran
to
the
kitchen
no
one
was
there
he
went
into
his
office
no
one
there
but
as
he
looked
about
him
he
saw
letter
on
his
desk
and
his
heart
leaped
he
grasped
it
eagerly
and
opened
it
with
a
trembling
hand
it
was
as
follows
have
gone
never
to
return
my
despair
and
disgust
of
life
are
such
that
without
my
mother
and
the
poor
being
who
is
so
far
away
i
should
kill
myself
but
in
spite
of
the
horror
of
my
position
i
was
obliged
to
reflect
and
i
do
not
wish
to
aggravate
by
folly
the
wickedness
that
is
going
on
about
me
my
mother
is
no
longer
young
she
is
ill
and
has
suffered
cruelly
not
only
do
i
owe
it
to
her
to
brighten
her
old
age
by
my
presence
by
the
material
and
moral
support
that
i
can
give
her
but
she
must
have
faith
that
i
am
there
to
replace
her
and
to
open
my
arms
to
her
son
to
my
brother
the
least
that
i
can
do
for
them
is
to
wait
courageously
for
him
and
however
weary
terrible
or
frightful
my
life
may
be
hereafter
i
shall
bear
it
so
that
the
unfortunate
the
pariah
whom
a
pitiless
fate
has
pursued
will
find
on
his
return
a
hearth
a
home
a
friend
this
will
be
my
only
object
my
reason
for
living
and
in
order
to
save
myself
from
sluggishness
and
weariness
my
thoughts
will
always
be
on
the
time
when
he
will
return
he
whom
i
will
call
my
child
and
whom
my
love
must
save
and
cure
i
know
that
long
years
separate
me
from
that
day
and
that
until
it
comes
my
broken
heart
will
never
have
a
moment
of
repose
but
i
shall
employ
this
time
in
working
for
him
for
the
brother
for
the
child
for
the
cherished
being
who
will
come
to
me
aged
and
desperate
and
i
wish
that
he
may
yet
believe
in
something
good
that
he
will
not
imagine
everything
in
this
world
is
unjust
and
infamous
for
he
will
return
to
me
weighed
down
by
twenty
years
of
shame
of
degrading
and
undeserved
shame
how
will
he
bear
these
twenty
years
what
efforts
must
i
not
make
to
prove
to
him
that
he
should
not
abandon
himself
to
despair
and
that
life
often
offers
the
remedy
compassion
to
the
most
profound
to
the
most
unjust
human
sorrows
how
can
i
make
him
believe
that
how
lead
his
poor
heart
closed
to
confidence
to
feeling
to
the
tears
that
alone
can
relieve
it
god
who
has
so
sorely
tried
me
without
doubt
will
come
to
my
aid
and
will
inspire
me
with
words
of
consolation
will
show
me
the
path
to
follow
and
give
me
the
strength
to
persevere
have
i
not
already
to
thank
him
for
being
alone
in
the
world
outside
of
a
mother
and
brother
who
will
not
betray
me
i
have
no
children
and
i
am
spared
the
terror
of
seeing
a
soul
growing
in
evil
an
intelligence
escaping
from
me
to
follow
the
path
of
infamy
or
dishonor
i
leave
then
as
i
came
i
was
a
poor
girl
i
go
away
a
poor
woman
i
have
taken
the
clothing
and
personal
effects
that
i
brought
into
our
common
home
nothing
that
was
bought
with
your
money
and
i
forbid
you
to
interfere
with
my
wish
in
this
question
of
material
things
as
well
as
in
my
resolution
to
fly
from
you
nothing
can
ever
reunite
us
nothing
shall
reunite
us
no
consideration
no
necessity
i
reject
the
past
this
guilty
past
the
responsibility
of
which
weighs
so
heavily
on
my
conscience
and
i
should
like
to
lose
the
memory
of
the
detested
time
it
would
be
impossible
for
me
to
accept
the
struggle
or
supplications
if
you
think
it
expedient
to
make
any
i
have
cut
our
bonds
and
hereafter
we
shall
be
as
far
apart
as
if
one
of
us
were
dead
or
even
farther
have
no
scruples
then
in
leaving
me
alone
to
face
a
new
life
a
beginning
that
may
appear
difficult
to
one
not
situated
as
i
am
the
trials
of
former
times
were
good
for
me
since
they
accustomed
me
to
the
difficulties
of
work
the
desolation
of
will
sustain
me
in
the
sense
that
having
suffered
all
i
can
suffer
i
no
longer
fear
some
discouraging
catastrophe
that
will
check
me
in
my
resolutions
in
order
not
to
compromise
you
and
more
fully
to
become
myself
again
i
shall
take
my
family
name
a
dishonored
name
but
i
shall
bear
it
without
shame
i
shall
live
obscurely
absorbed
in
work
and
in
trying
to
forget
your
existence
do
the
same
yourself
if
you
think
of
the
past
you
will
find
perhaps
that
i
am
hard
yet
this
departure
is
not
an
egotistic
desertion
i
am
no
good
to
you
and
the
repose
that
you
want
would
shun
you
hereafter
in
my
presence
on
the
contrary
strive
for
forgetfulness
as
i
shall
if
you
contrive
to
wipe
out
of
your
life
the
part
that
is
associated
with
me
perhaps
you
will
be
able
to
banish
the
remainder
and
to
recover
some
of
the
calm
of
other
days
i
can
no
longer
remember
that
i
have
loved
you
for
my
position
is
such
that
i
have
not
the
refuge
of
memory
at
my
age
i
must
remain
without
a
past
as
without
a
future
the
consolation
of
the
unfortunate
is
lost
to
me
with
everything
else
i
can
not
rise
out
of
my
sorrow
to
try
to
find
one
hour
when
life
was
sweet
to
me
those
hours
on
the
contrary
make
me
tremble
and
i
reproach
myself
for
them
as
if
they
were
a
crime
thus
whichever
way
i
turn
i
find
only
sadness
and
sharp
regrets
everything
is
blighted
dishonored
for
standing
in
the
middle
of
his
office
he
read
this
hastily
written
letter
breathlessly
arrived
at
the
end
he
looked
about
him
vaguely
his
chair
was
near
his
desk
he
let
himself
fall
into
it
and
remained
there
prostrated
holding
the
letter
in
his
shaking
hand
it
was
an
october
afternoon
dark
and
muddy
in
the
rue
des
in
front
of
the
houses
that
hide
the
charity
hospital
coupes
were
standing
and
their
long
line
extended
to
the
boulevard
where
the
coachmen
having
left
their
seats
talked
together
like
persons
who
were
accustomed
to
meet
each
other
at
four
in
the
deepening
twilight
men
with
grave
looks
and
dark
clothes
members
of
the
academy
of
medicine
the
tuesday
sitting
over
issued
from
the
porch
and
entered
their
carriages
some
of
them
walked
alone
briskly
in
a
great
hurry
others
demonstrated
a
skilful
tardiness
stopping
to
talk
politely
to
a
journalist
and
to
give
him
notes
of
the
meeting
or
continuing
with
a
who
was
not
an
academician
the
conversation
begun
in
the
room
of
the
it
was
the
bourse
of
consultations
that
was
just
closed
not
all
the
members
of
the
academy
have
in
truth
a
long
list
of
patients
to
visit
but
each
one
has
a
vote
to
give
and
they
are
those
whom
the
candidates
surround
trying
to
win
them
one
of
the
academicians
who
appeared
the
last
at
the
top
of
the
steps
was
a
man
of
great
height
but
bent
figure
with
hollow
cheeks
and
pale
face
lighted
by
pale
blue
eyes
with
a
strange
expression
both
hard
and
desolate
at
the
same
time
he
advanced
alone
and
his
heavy
gait
and
dragging
step
gave
him
the
appearance
of
a
man
sixty
years
of
age
while
in
other
ways
he
retained
a
certain
youthfulness
it
was
saniel
twenty
years
older
without
exchanging
a
bow
or
a
with
any
one
he
descended
to
the
pavement
and
walked
to
the
boulevard
where
he
opened
the
door
of
a
coups
whose
interior
showed
a
complete
ambulant
library
a
writing
table
with
paper
ink
and
lamp
pockets
full
of
books
and
pamphlets
just
as
he
was
about
to
enter
a
voice
stopped
him
he
turned
it
was
one
of
his
old
pupils
who
had
recently
become
a
physician
in
the
suburb
of
gentilly
is
it
asked
saniel
want
to
ask
you
to
come
and
assist
me
in
a
curious
case
of
spasms
where
your
intervention
may
be
the
a
poor
woman
what
day
could
you
give
me
it
urgent
that
case
i
will
go
at
once
give
the
address
to
my
coachman
and
get
in
with
but
at
this
moment
a
man
dressed
in
chestnut
velvet
wearing
a
felt
hat
and
sabots
came
toward
them
accompanied
by
two
young
men
with
whom
he
discoursed
in
a
loud
tone
while
gesticulating
people
turned
to
look
at
them
so
original
was
the
appearance
of
old
brigard
the
same
man
from
head
to
foot
that
he
had
always
been
he
came
to
saniel
with
outstretched
hands
and
saniel
taking
off
his
hat
received
him
with
marked
respect
to
meet
you
brigard
said
i
went
to
your
office
yesterday
and
did
not
find
did
you
not
send
me
word
beforehand
if
you
need
me
i
am
at
your
but
happily
i
do
not
need
your
advice
neither
for
myself
nor
my
family
it
was
simply
that
i
wished
to
see
you
arriving
at
your
house
before
your
office
hours
i
waited
in
your
and
several
patients
came
after
me
a
young
woman
who
appeared
to
suffer
cruelly
an
old
lady
who
was
extremely
anxious
and
lastly
a
man
who
had
some
nervous
disease
that
would
not
permit
him
to
sit
still
and
looking
at
them
i
said
to
myself
that
as
i
was
only
making
a
friendly
visit
i
would
not
remain
and
prolong
the
waiting
of
these
unfortunates
who
counted
the
minutes
so
i
came
i
ask
to
what
do
i
owe
the
honor
of
this
visit
the
two
young
men
who
accompanied
brigard
and
old
pupil
discreetly
withdrew
desire
to
present
you
my
congratulations
when
i
learned
of
your
candidature
to
the
academy
of
medicine
i
said
to
myself
here
is
one
who
has
no
chance
friend
saniel
has
originality
and
force
he
has
succeeded
brilliantly
but
these
qualities
are
not
exactly
academic
i
was
deceived
you
have
broken
open
the
doors
which
is
the
only
way
that
i
understand
of
entering
these
places
that
is
why
i
congratulate
you
and
besides
i
did
you
wrong
formerly
you
accused
you
of
believing
yourself
stronger
than
life
in
truth
you
were
my
compliments
after
warmly
pressing
hands
he
went
on
his
way
with
his
two
disciples
preaching
to
them
the
young
doctor
approached
saniel
is
an
original
he
said
happy
man
was
the
only
reply
etext

as
ignorant
as
a
schoolmaster
as
free
from
prejudices
as
one
may
be
one
always
retains
a
few
confidence
in
self
is
strength
but
it
is
also
weakness
conscience
is
a
bad
conscience
is
only
an
affair
of
environment
and
of
education
find
it
more
easy
to
make
myself
feared
than
loved
for
the
rest
of
his
life
he
would
be
the
prisoner
of
his
crime
force
which
is
the
last
word
of
the
philosophy
of
life
he
did
not
sleep
so
much
the
better
he
would
work
more
i
believed
in
the
virtue
of
work
and
look
at
me
in
his
eyes
everything
was
decided
by
luck
intelligent
persons
have
no
remorse
it
is
the
first
crime
that
costs
it
is
only
those
who
own
something
who
worry
about
the
price
leant
and
when
i
did
not
lose
my
friends
i
lost

must
be
had
for
light

and
even
more
for

for

in
a

of

neither
so
simple
nor
so
easy
as
they
at
first
appeared

not
judge
those
whom
one
loves
people
whose
principle
was
never
to
pay
a
doctor
power
to
work
that
was
never
disturbed
or
weakened
by
anything

before
the
deed
and
not
after
repeated
and
explained
what
he
had
already
said
and
explained
she
could
not
bear
contempt
the
strong
walk
alone
because
they
need
no
one
we
are
so
unhappy
that
our
souls
are
weak
against
joy
we
weep
we
do
not
complain
will
not
admit
that
conscience
is
the
proper
guide
of
our
action
you
love
me
therefore
you
do
not
know
me
