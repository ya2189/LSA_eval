idyllic

the

not
far
from
here
it
lies
beyond
that
belt
of
woods
we
take
this
unused
lane
where
brambles
make
a
wall
of
twilight
and
the
blond
pelt
the
path
and
flake
the
margin
waters
of
a

this
is
its

or
that
which
was
its
fence
once
now
rock
rolled
from
rock
one
tangle
of
the
vine
and
dock
where
bloom
the
wild
petunias
and
this
its
gate
the
block
hot
with
the
insects
dusty
buzz
two
wooden
posts
wherefrom
has
peeled
the
paint
still
rise
gaunt
things
that
groan
when
someone
tries
the
gate
whose
hinges
snarl
open
on
each
post
still
lies
its
carven
lion
with
a
shield
we
enter
and
between
great
rows
of
locusts
winds
a
road
and
at
its
glimmering
end
with
quiet
light
the
white
front
shows
of
an
old
mansion
grand
and
broad
with
grave
colonial
porticoes
grown
thick
around
it
dark
and
deep
the
locust
trees
make
one
vast
hush
their
brawny
branches
crowd
and
crush
its
very
casements
and
its
rotting
roofs
their
tranquil
rush
haunts
all
its
spacious
rooms
with
sleep
still
is
it
called
the
locusts
though
none
lives
here
now
a
tale
to
tell
of
some
dark
thing
that
here
befell
a
crime
that
happened
years
ago
when
by
its
walls
with
shot
and
shell
the
war
swept
on
and
left
it
so
for
one
black
night
within
it
shame
made
revel
while
all
here
about
with
prayer
or
curse
or
men
died
and
homesteads
leapt
in
flame
then
passed
the
conquering
northern
rout
and
left
it
silent
and
the
same
why
should
i
speak
of
what
has
been
or
what
dark
part
i
played
in
all
why
ruin
sits
in
porch
and
hall
where
pride
and
gladness
once
were
seen
and
why
beneath
this
lichened
wall
the
grave
of
margaret
is
green
margaret
whose
fate
was
sadder
yet
than
his
who
won
her
hand
my
brother
hamilton
or
mine
who
learned
to
know
too
late
who
learned
to
know
when
all
was
done
and
nothing
could
exonerate
to
expiate
is
still
my
lot
and
like
the
ancient
mariner
to
show
to
others
how
things
are
and
what
i
am
still
helps
me
blot
a
little
from
that
crime
red
scar
that
on
my
soul
is
branded
hot
he
was
my
only
brother
she
a
sister
of
my
brother
friend
they
met
and
married
in
the
end
and
i
remember
well
when
he
brought
her
rejoicing
home
the
trend
of
war
moved
towards
us
sullenly
and
scarce
a
year
of
wedlock
when
its
red
arms
took
him
from
his
bride
with
lips
by
hers
thrice
sanctified
he
left
to
ride
with
morgan
men
and
i
i
never
could
decide
remained
at
home
it
happened
then
for
days
went
by
and
oft
delayed
a
letter
came
of
loving
word
scrawled
by
some
or
by
a
fitful
aid
when
in
the
saddle
armed
and
spurred
and
booted
for
some
hurried
raid
then
weeks
went
by
i
do
not
know
how
long
it
was
before
there
came
blown
from
the
north
the
clarion
fame
of
morgan
who
with
blow
on
blow
had
drawn
a
line
of
blood
and
flame
from
tennessee
to
ohio
then
letters
ceased
and
days
went
on
no
word
from
him
the
war
rolled
back
and
in
its
turgid
crimson
track
a
rumor
grew
like
some
wild
dawn
all
ominous
and
red
and
black
with
news
of
our
lost
hamilton
that
hinted
death
or
capture
yet
no
thing
was
sure
till
one
day
fed
by
us
some
men
rode
up
who
said
they
been
with
morgan
and
had
met
disaster
and
that
he
was
dead
my
i
and
margaret
believed
them
grief
was
ours
too
but
mine
was
more
for
her
than
him
grief
that
her
eyes
with
tears
were
dim
grief
that
became
the
avenue
for
love
who
crowned
the
sombre
brim
of
death
dark
cup
with
hue
in
sympathy
unconsciously
though
it
be
given
i
hold
doth
dwell
the
germ
of
love
that
time
shall
swell
to
blossom
sooner
then
in
me
when
close
relations
so
befell
that
love
should
spring
from
sympathy
our
similar
tastes
and
mutual
bents
combined
to
make
us
intimates
from
our
first
meeting
different
states
of
interest
then
our
temperaments
begot
then
friendship
that
abates
no
love
whose
self
it
represents
these
led
to
talks
and
dreams
how
oft
we
sat
at
some
wide
window
while
the
sun
sank
the
hills
far
file
serene
and
of
the
cloud
aloft
made
one
vast
rose
and
mile
on
mile
of
firmament
grew
sad
and
soft
and
all
in
harmony
with
these
dim
clemencies
of
dusk
afar
our
talks
and
dreams
went
while
the
star
of
evening
brightened
the
trees
we
spoke
of
home
the
end
of
war
we
dreamed
of
life
and
love
and
peace
how
on
our
walks
in
listening
lanes
or
confidences
of
the
wood
we
paused
to
hear
the
dove
that
cooed
or
gathered
taking
pains
to
find
the
fairest
or
her
hood
filled
with
wild
fruit
that
left
deep
stains
no
echo
of
the
drum
or
fife
no
hint
of
conflict
entered
in
our
thoughts
then
will
you
call
it
sin
indifference
to
a
nation
strife
what
side
might
lose
what
side
might
win
both
immaterial
to
our
life
into
the
past
we
did
not
look
beyond
what
was
we
did
not
dream
while
onward
rushed
the
thunderous
stream
of
war
that
in
its
torrent
took
one
of
our
own
no
crimson
gleam
of
its
wild
course
around
us
shook
at
last
we
knew
and
when
we
learned
how
he
had
fallen
margaret
wept
and
albeit
my
eyes
were
wet
within
my
soul
i
half
discerned
a
joy
that
mingled
with
regret
a
grief
that
to
relief
was
turned
as
time
went
on
and
confidence
drew
us
more
strongly
each
to
each
why
did
no
intimation
reach
its
warning
hand
into
the
dense
and
confuse
the
speech
of
love
unbroken
eloquence
but
no
no
hint
to
turn
the
poise
or
check
the
impulse
of
our
youth
to
chill
it
with
the
living
truth
as
with
the
awe
of
god
own
voice
no
hint
to
make
our
hope
uncouth
no
word
to
warn
us
from
our
choice
to
me
a
wall
seemed
overthrown
that
social
law
had
raised
between
and
its
ruin
broad
and
green
a
path
went
i
possessed
alone
the
sky
above
seemed
all
serene
the
land
around
seemed
all
my
own
what
shall
i
say
of
margaret
to
justify
her
part
in
this
that
her
young
heart
was
never
his
but
had
been
mine
since
first
we
met
so
would
you
say
enough
it
is
that
when
he
left
she
loved
him
yet
so
passed
the
spring
and
summer
sped
and
early
autumn
brought
the
day
when
she
her
hand
in
mine
should
lay
and
i
should
take
her
hand
and
and
still
no
hint
that
might
gainsay
no
warning
word
of
quick
or
dead
the
day
arrived
and
with
it
born
a
battle
sullying
the
east
with
boom
of
cannon
that
increased
and
throb
of
musket
and
of
horn
until
at
last
towards
dusk
it
ceased
and
men
with
faces
wild
and
worn
in
fierce
retreat
swept
past
now
groups
now
one
by
one
now
sternly
white
or
now
with
looks
whose
fright
said
all
was
lost
then
sullen
troops
that
beaten
still
kept
up
the
fight
then
came
the
victors
shadowy
loops
of
men
and
horse
that
left
a
crowd
of
officers
in
hall
and
porch
while
through
the
land
around
the
torch
circled
and
many
a
fiery
cloud
marked
out
the
army
iron
march
in
furrows
red
that
pillage
plowed
here
we
were
ask
the
years
how
such
could
be
while
over
us
a
sword
of
wrath
swung
ominous
and
on
our
cheeks
its
breath
was
fierce
all
i
remember
is
was
thus
and
margaret
eyes
were
wet
with
tears
no
other
cause
my
memory
sees
save
this
night
was
and
when
i
found
my
home
filled
with
armed
men
with
whom
were
all
my
sympathies
of
union
why
postpone
it
then
so
argued
conscience
into
peace
and
then
it
was
when
night
had
passed
there
came
to
me
an
orderly
with
word
of
a
confederate
spy
late
taken
who
with
head
downcast
had
asked
one
favor
this
that
i
would
see
him
ere
he
breathed
his
last
i
stand
alone
here
heavily
my
thoughts
go
back
had
i
not
gone
the
dead
had
still
been
dead
for
none
had
yet
believed
his
story
he
my
brother
hamilton
who
in
the
spy
confronted
me
o
you
who
never
have
been
tried
how
can
you
judge
me
in
my
place
i
saw
him
standing
who
can
trace
my
heart
thoughts
then
i
turned
aside
a
thing
of
some
unnatural
race
and
did
not
speak
and
so
he
died
in
hospital
or
prison
when
it
was
he
lay
what
had
forbid
his
home
return
so
long
amid
what
hardships
he
had
suffered
then
i
dared
not
ask
and
when
i
did
long
afterwards
inquire
of
men
no
thing
i
learned
but
this
i
feel
he
who
had
so
returned
to
life
was
not
a
spy
through
stress
and
strife
this
makes
my
conscience
hard
to
heal
he
had
escaped
he
sought
his
wife
he
sought
his
home
that
should
conceal
and
margaret
oh
pity
her
a
criminal
i
sought
her
side
still
thinking
love
was
justified
in
all
for
her
whatever
were
the
price
a
brother
thrice
denied
or
thrice
a
brother
murderer
since
then
long
years
have
passed
away
and
through
those
years
perhaps
you
ask
how
to
the
world
i
wore
my
mask
of
honesty
i
can
but
say
beyond
my
powers
it
was
a
task
before
my
time
it
turned
me
gray
and
when
at
last
the
ceaseless
hiss
of
conscience
drove
and
i
betrayed
all
to
her
she
knelt
down
and
prayed
then
rose
and
us
an
abyss
was
opened
and
she
seemed
to
fade
out
of
my
life
i
came
to
miss
the
sweet
attentions
of
a
bride
for
each
appealing
heart
caress
in
me
her
heart
assumed
a
dress
of
dull
indifference
till
denied
to
me
was
all
responsiveness
and
then
i
knew
her
love
had
died
ah
had
she
loaded
me
perchance
with
wild
reproach
or
even
hate
such
would
have
helped
a
hope
to
wait
forgiveness
and
returned
romance
but
our
souls
instead
a
gate
she
closed
of
silent
tolerance
yet
was
for
love
of
her
i
lent
my
soul
to
crime
i
question
me
often
if
less
entirely
i
loved
her
then
in
that
event
she
had
been
justified
to
see
the
deed
alone
stand
prominent
the
deed
alone
but
love
records
in
his
own
heart
i
will
aver
no
depth
i
did
not
feel
for
her
beyond
the
of
words
and
though
there
may
be
worthier
no
truer
love
this
world
affords
than
mine
was
though
it
could
not
rise
above
itself
and
so
was
best
perhaps
that
she
saw
manifest
its
crime
that
i
as
saw
her
eyes
might
see
and
so
in
soul
confessed
some
life
atonement
might
devise
sadly
my
heart
one
comfort
keeps
that
towards
the
end
she
took
my
hands
and
said
as
one
who
understands
had
i
but
seen
but
love
that
weeps
sees
only
as
its
loss
commands
and
sighed
beneath
this
stone
she
sleeps
yes
i
have
suffered
for
that
sin
yet
in
no
instance
would
i
shun
what
i
should
suffer
many
a
one
who
heard
my
tale
has
tried
to
win
me
to
believe
that
hamilton
it
was
not
and
though
proven
kin
this
had
not
saved
him
still
the
stain
of
the
intention
had
i
erred
and
was
not
he
had
writ
the
word
red
on
my
soul
that
branded
cain
for
still
my
error
had
incurred
the
fact
of
guilt
that
would
remain
ah
love
at
best
is
insecure
and
lives
with
doubt
and
vain
regret
and
hope
and
faith
with
faces
set
upon
the
past
are
never
sure
and
through
their
fever
grief
and
fret
the
heart
may
fail
that
should
endure
for
in
ourselves
however
blend
the
passions
that
make
heaven
and
hell
is
evil
not
accountable
for
most
the
good
we
comprehend
and
through
these
two
or
ill
or
well
man
must
evolve
his
spiritual
end
it
is
with
deeds
that
we
must
ask
forgiveness
for
upon
this
earth
life
walks
alone
from
very
birth
with
death
hope
tells
us
is
a
mask
for
life
beyond
of
vaster
worth
where
sin
no
more
sets
love
a
task
geraldine
ah
geraldine
lost
geraldine
that
night
of
love
when
first
we
met
you
have
forgotten
geraldine
i
never
dreamed
you
would
forget
ah
geraldine
sweet
geraldine
more
lovely
than
that
asian
queen
scheherazade
the
beautiful
who
in
her
orient
palace
cool
of
india
for
a
thousand
nights
and
one
beside
her
monarch
lay
telling
while
lights
and
music
stole
the
soul
away
love
tales
of
old
arabia
full
of
enchantments
and
emprise
but
no
enchantments
like
your
eyes
ah
geraldine
loved
geraldine
more
lovely
than
those
maids
i
ween
pampinea
and
lauretta
who
in
gardens
old
of
dusk
and
dew
sat
with
their
lovers
maid
and
man
in
stately
days
italian
and
in
quaint
stories
that
we
know
through
grace
of
good
boccaccio
told
of
fond
loves
some
false
some
true
but
geraldine
none
false
as
you
ah
geraldine
lost
geraldine
that
night
of
love
when
first
we
met
you
have
forgotten
geraldine
i
never
dreamed
you
would
forget
was
summer
and
the
moon
swam
high
a
great
pale
pearl
within
the
sky
and
down
that
purple
night
of
love
the
stars
concurrent
spark
on
spark
seemed
fiery
moths
that
swarmed
above
and
through
the
roses
the
park
the
filled
the
dark
a
in
some
deep
tree
drowsy
with
dreams
and
melody
like
a
magnolia
bud
that
dim
opens
and
pours
its
soul
in
musk
gave
to
the
moonlight
and
the
dusk
its
heart
pure
song
its
evening
hymn
oh
night
of
love
when
in
the
dance
your
heart
thrilled
rapture
into
mine
as
in
a
state
of
necromance
a
mortal
hears
a
voice
divine
oh
night
of
love
when
from
your
glance
i
drank
sweet
death
as
men
drink
wine
you
wearied
of
the
waltz
at
last
i
led
you
out
into
the
night
warm
in
my
hand
i
held
yours
fast
your
face
was
flushed
your
eyes
were
bright
the
moon
hung
like
a
shell
of
light
above
the
lake
above
the
trees
and
borne
to
us
with
fragrances
of
roses
that
were
ripe
to
fall
the
soul
of
music
from
the
hall
beat
in
the
moonlight
and
the
breeze
as
youth
wild
heart
grown
weary
of
desire
and
its
dream
of
love
i
held
your
arm
and
for
awhile
we
walked
along
the
balmy
aisle
of
flowers
that
like
velvet
dips
unto
the
lake
which
lilies
tile
like
stars
and
hyacinths
like
strips
of
heaven
and
beside
a
fall
that
down
a
ferned
and
mossy
wall
fell
in
the
lake
deep
a
latticed
we
found
a
green
kiosk
through
which
the
sound
of
waters
and
of
breezes
swayed
and
honeysuckle
bugles
played
soft
serenades
of
perfume
sweet
around
which
ran
a
rustic
seat
and
seated
in
that
haunted
nook
i
know
not
how
it
was
a
word
a
touch
perhaps
a
sigh
a
look
was
father
to
the
kiss
i
took
great
things
grow
out
of
small
i
heard
and
then
it
was
i
took
between
my
hands
your
face
loved
geraldine
and
gazed
into
your
eyes
and
told
the
story
ever
new
though
old
you
did
not
look
away
but
met
my
eyes
with
eyes
whose
lids
were
wet
with
tears
of
truth
and
you
did
lean
your
cheek
to
mine
sweet
geraldine
i
never
dreamed
you
would
forget
the
and
the
water
sighed
and
through
the
leaves
that
stirred
above
the
moonbeams
swooned
with
music
of
the
dance
soft
things
in
league
with
love
i
never
dreamed
that
you
had
lied
how
all
comes
back
now
geraldine
the
melody
the
glimmering
scene
your
angel
face
and
between
your
lawny
breasts
the
jewel
to
which
your
breath
gave
fluctuant
fuel
a
rosy
star
of
stormy
fire
the
snowy
drift
of
your
attire
and
fragrant
and
your
hair
disordered
in
the
dance
held
back
by
one
gemmed
pin
a
moonbeam
there
within
its
black
and
i
who
sat
beside
you
then
seemed
blessed
above
all
mortal
men
i
loved
you
for
the
way
you
sighed
the
way
you
said
i
love
but
you
the
smile
with
which
your
lips
replied
your
lips
that
from
my
bosom
drew
the
soul
your
looks
like
undenied
caresses
that
seemed
naught
but
true
i
loved
you
for
the
violet
scent
that
clung
about
you
as
a
flower
your
moods
where
shine
and
shadow
blent
an
of
sun
and
shower
you
were
my
creed
my
testament
wherein
i
read
of
god
high
power
was
it
because
the
loving
see
only
what
they
desire
shall
be
there
in
the
soul
affection
and
affinity
that
i
beheld
in
you
the
whole
of
my
love
image
and
believed
you
loved
as
i
did
nor
perceived
was
but
a
mask
a
mockery
ah
geraldine
lost
geraldine
that
night
of
love
when
first
we
met
you
have
forgotten
geraldine
i
never
dreamed
you
would
forget
the
moated
manse
i
and
now
once
more
we
stood
within
the
walls
of
her
old
manor
near
the
riverside
dead
leaves
lay
rotting
in
its
empty
halls
and
here
and
there
the
ivy
could
not
hide
the
scars
made
by
the
royalists
balls
around
the
doorway
where
so
many
died
in
that
last
effort
to
defend
the
stair
when
rupert
like
a
demon
entered
there
ii
the
basest
cavalier
who
yet
wore
spurs
or
drew
a
sword
i
count
him
with
his
grave
eyes
his
plumed
hat
like
a
wolf
whom
curs
rouse
to
their
harm
within
a
forest
cave
and
hair
like
harvest
and
a
voice
like
verse
for
smoothness
ay
a
handsome
man
and
brave
brave
who
would
question
it
although
is
true
he
warred
with
one
weak
woman
and
her
few
iii
lady
isolda
of
the
moated
manse
whom
here
that
very
noon
it
happened
me
to
meet
near
her
old
home
a
single
glance
told
me
was
she
i
marveled
much
to
see
how
lovely
still
she
was
as
fair
perchance
as
when
red
rupert
thrust
her
brutally
her
long
hair
loosened
down
the
shattered
stair
and
cast
her
shrieking
his
followers
there
iv
she
is
for
you
take
her
i
promised
it
she
is
for
you
he
shouted
as
he
flung
her
in
their
midst
then
on
her
poor
hands
split
and
beaten
by
his
dagger
when
she
clung
resisting
him
and
knees
she
crept
a
bit
nearer
his
feet
and
begged
for
death
no
tongue
can
tell
the
way
he
turned
from
her
and
cursed
then
bade
his
men
draw
lots
for
which
were
first
i
saw
it
all
from
that
low
parapet
where
in
the
hip
and
head
i
lay
in
the
whispering
wet
exhausted
the
dead
and
left
for
dead
we
had
held
out
two
days
without
a
let
against
these
bandits
you
could
trace
with
red
from
room
to
room
how
we
resisted
hard
since
the
great
door
crashed
in
to
their
petard
vi
the
rain
revived
me
and
i
leaned
with
pain
and
saw
her
lying
there
all
soiled
and
splashed
and
miserable
on
her
cheek
a
stain
a
dull
red
bruise
made
when
his
hand
had
dashed
her
down
upon
the
stones
the
wretched
rain
dripped
from
her
dark
hair
and
her
hands
were
oh
for
a
musket
or
a
petronel
with
which
to
send
his
devil
soul
to
hell
vii
but
helpless
there
i
lay
no
weapon
near
only
the
useless
sword
i
could
not
reach
his
traitor
heart
with
while
i
chafed
to
hear
the
laugh
the
insult
and
the
villain
speech
of
him
to
her
oh
god
could
i
but
clear
the
height
between
and
hanging
like
a
leech
my
fingers
at
his
throat
there
tear
his
base
vile
tongue
out
yea
and
lash
it
in
his
face
viii
but
badly
wounded
what
could
i
but
weep
with
rage
and
pity
of
my
helplessness
and
her
misfortune
could
i
only
creep
a
little
nearer
so
that
she
might
guess
i
was
not
dead
that
i
my
life
would
keep
but
to
avenge
her
oh
the
wild
distress
of
that
last
moment
when
i
saw
them
mount
and
bear
her
swooning
through
the
shaw
ix
long
time
i
lay
unconscious
it
befell
some
woodsmen
found
me
having
heard
the
sound
of
fighting
cease
that
for
two
days
made
dell
and
dingle
echo
ventured
on
the
ground
for
plunder
and
it
had
not
then
gone
well
with
me
i
fear
had
not
their
leader
found
that
in
some
way
i
would
repay
his
care
so
bore
me
to
his
hut
and
nursed
me
there
x
how
roughly
kind
he
was
for
weeks
i
hung
life
and
death
health
like
a
varying
sick
and
fluttering
pendulum
now
this
way
swung
now
that
until
at
last
its
querulous
tick
beat
out
life
usual
time
and
slowly
rung
the
long
loud
hours
that
exclaimed
be
quick
arise
go
forth
hear
how
her
black
wrongs
call
make
them
the
salve
to
cure
thy
wounds
withal
xi
they
were
my
balsam
for
ere
autumn
came
weak
still
but
over
eager
to
be
gone
i
took
my
leave
of
him
a
little
lame
from
that
and
somewhat
thin
and
wan
i
sought
the
village
here
i
heard
her
name
and
shame
made
one
how
rupert
passed
one
dawn
and
she
among
his
troopers
rode
astride
like
any
man
and
xii
which
way
these
took
they
pointed
and
i
went
like
fire
after
oh
the
thought
was
good
that
they
were
on
before
and
much
it
meant
to
know
she
lived
still
she
whose
image
stood
ever
before
me
making
turbulent
each
with
her
wrongs
that
were
fierce
food
unto
my
hate
that
courage
cried
rest
not
think
of
her
there
and
let
thy
haste
be
hot
xiii
but
months
passed
by
and
still
i
had
not
found
yet
here
and
there
as
wearily
i
sought
i
caught
some
news
how
he
had
held
his
ground
against
the
roundhead
troops
or
how
he
fought
then
fled
returned
and
conquered
like
a
hound
questing
a
boar
i
followed
but
was
brought
never
to
see
my
quarry
day
by
day
it
seemed
that
satan
kept
him
from
my
way
xiv
a
woman
rode
beside
him
so
they
said
a
wanton
mounted
like
a
man
isolda
my
isolda
better
dead
yea
dead
and
damned
than
thus
the
courtesan
bold
unreluctant
of
such
men
a
dread
that
such
should
be
unmanned
me
doubt
began
to
whisper
at
my
but
i
was
mad
to
insult
her
with
such
thoughts
whose
love
i
had
xv
at
last
one
day
i
rested
in
a
glade
near
that
same
woodland
which
i
lay
in
when
sore
wounded
and
while
sitting
in
the
shade
of
an
old
beech
what
did
i
dream
or
men
like
rupert
own
ride
near
me
and
a
maid
isolda
or
her
spirit
wildly
then
i
rose
and
shouting
leapt
upon
my
horse
unsheathed
my
sword
and
rode
across
their
course
xvi
mainly
i
looked
for
rupert
and
by
name
challenged
him
forth
dog
dost
thou
hide
behind
insulter
of
women
coward
save
where
shame
and
rapine
call
thee
god
at
last
is
kind
and
my
sword
waits
like
an
upbeating
flame
my
voice
rose
to
a
windy
shout
and
blind
i
seemed
to
sit
till
with
an
outstretched
hand
isolda
rode
before
me
from
that
band
xvii
gerald
she
cried
not
as
a
heart
surprised
with
gladness
that
the
loved
deemed
dead
still
lives
but
like
the
heart
that
long
hath
realized
only
misfortune
and
to
fortune
gives
no
confidence
though
it
be
recognized
as
good
she
spoke
lo
we
are
fugitives
rupert
is
slain
and
i
am
going
home
then
like
a
child
asked
simply
wilt
thou
come
xviii
oh
i
have
suffered
gerald
oh
my
god
what
shame
what
vileness
once
my
soul
was
clean
stained
and
defiled
behold
it
i
have
trod
sad
ways
of
hell
and
horror
i
have
seen
and
lived
all
depths
of
lust
yet
oh
my
god
blameless
i
hold
myself
of
what
hath
been
though
through
it
all
yea
this
thou
too
must
know
i
loved
him
my
betrayer
and
thy
foe
xix
sobbing
she
spoke
as
if
but
half
awake
her
eyes
beyond
me
far
beyond
all
hope
of
so
it
was
for
his
sake
his
love
that
she
had
suffered
blind
and
fond
for
what
return
and
i
to
nurse
a
snake
and
never
dream
its
nature
would
respond
with
some
such
fang
of
venom
was
for
this
that
i
had
ventured
all
to
find
her
his
xx
at
first
i
stood
then
blood
and
brain
like
two
stern
judges
who
had
slept
awoke
rose
up
and
thundered
slay
her
every
vein
and
nerve
responded
slay
her
at
a
stroke
and
i
had
done
it
but
my
heart
again
like
a
strong
captain
in
a
tumult
spoke
and
the
fierce
discord
fell
and
quietly
i
sheathed
my
sword
and
said
i
go
with
thee
xxi
but
this
was
my
reward
for
all
i
borne
my
loyalty
and
love
to
see
her
eyes
hollow
from
tears
for
him
her
pale
cheeks
worn
with
grief
for
him
to
know
them
all
for
lies
her
vows
of
faith
to
me
to
come
forlorn
where
i
had
hoped
to
come
on
paradise
on
hell
black
gulf
and
as
if
not
enough
soiled
as
she
was
and
outcast
still
to
love
xxii
then
rode
one
ruffian
from
the
rest
from
spur
to
plume
with
hurry
seized
my
rein
and
what
art
thou
demanded
who
hast
checked
our
way
and
challenged
then
with
some
disdain
isolda
sir
my
kinsman
did
expect
your
captain
here
what
honor
may
remain
to
me
i
pledge
for
him
hold
off
thy
hands
he
but
attends
me
to
the
moated
manse
xxiii
we
rode
in
silence
and
at
twilight
came
into
the
moated
great
clouds
had
grown
up
in
the
west
on
which
the
sunset
flame
lay
like
the
hand
of
very
lone
its
rooms
and
halls
a
splintered
door
that
lame
swung
on
one
hinge
a
cabinet
or
arras
torn
or
turning
wan
showed
us
the
way
the
battle
once
had
gone
xxiv
we
reached
the
towards
the
west
in
which
on
that
dark
day
she
thought
to
hide
from
rupert
when
at
last
was
manifest
we
could
not
hold
the
manse
there
was
no
pride
in
her
deep
eyes
now
nor
did
scorn
invest
her
with
such
dignity
as
once
defied
him
bursting
in
to
find
her
standing
here
prepared
to
die
like
some
deer
xxv
she
took
my
hand
and
as
if
naught
of
love
had
ever
been
between
us
said
all
know
the
madness
of
that
day
when
with
his
glove
he
struck
then
slew
my
brother
and
brought
woe
on
all
our
house
and
thou
incensed
above
the
rest
came
here
and
made
my
foe
thy
foe
but
he
had
left
was
then
i
promised
thee
my
hand
but
ah
my
heart
was
gone
from
me
xxvi
yea
he
had
won
me
this
same
rupert
when
he
was
our
thou
how
gallantry
and
beauty
can
make
heroes
of
all
men
to
us
weak
women
and
so
secretly
i
vowed
to
be
his
wife
it
happened
then
my
brother
found
him
in
some
villainy
the
insult
followed
he
was
killed
and
thou
dost
still
remember
how
i
made
a
vow
xxvii
but
still
this
man
pursued
me
and
i
held
firm
to
my
vow
albeit
i
loved
him
still
unknown
to
all
with
all
the
love
unquelled
of
first
impressions
and
against
my
will
at
last
despair
of
winning
me
compelled
him
to
the
oath
he
swore
he
would
not
kill
but
take
me
living
and
would
make
my
life
a
living
death
no
man
should
make
me
wife
xxviii
the
war
that
now
consumes
us
did
indeed
give
him
i
had
not
been
warned
when
down
he
came
against
me
in
the
lead
of
his
marauders
with
thy
help
i
scorned
his
mad
attacks
two
days
i
would
not
plead
nor
parley
with
him
who
came
hoofed
and
horned
like
satan
self
in
soul
and
with
his
aid
took
this
strong
house
and
kept
the
oath
he
made
xxix
months
passed
alas
it
needs
not
here
to
tell
what
often
thou
hast
heard
of
how
he
led
his
troopers
here
now
there
nor
what
befell
me
of
dishonor
oft
i
wished
me
dead
loathing
my
life
than
which
the
nether
hell
hath
less
of
horror
so
we
fought
or
fled
from
place
to
place
until
a
year
had
passed
and
parliament
forces
hemmed
us
in
at
last
xxx
yea
i
had
only
lived
for
this
to
right
with
death
my
wrongs
sometime
and
love
and
hate
contended
in
my
bosom
when
that
night
before
the
fight
that
should
decide
our
fate
i
entered
where
he
slept
there
was
no
light
save
of
the
stars
to
see
by
long
and
late
i
leaned
above
him
there
yet
could
not
kill
hate
raised
the
dagger
but
love
held
it
still
xxxi
the
woman
in
me
conquered
what
a
slave
to
our
emotions
are
we
to
relent
at
this
moment
wave
on
wave
of
pitying
weakness
swept
me
and
i
bent
and
kissed
his
face
then
prayed
to
god
and
gave
my
trust
to
god
and
left
to
god
th
i
never
looked
on
rupert
face
again
for
in
that
morning
combat
he
was
slain
xxxii
out
of
defeat
escaped
some
scant
three
score
of
all
his
followers
and
night
and
day
they
fled
and
while
the
roundheads
pressed
them
sore
and
in
their
road
good
as
a
fortress
lay
the
moated
manse
where
their
three
score
or
more
might
well
hold
out
i
pointed
them
the
way
and
they
are
come
amid
its
wrecks
to
end
the
crime
begun
thou
must
go
my
friend
xxxiii
go
quickly
for
the
time
approaches
when
destruction
must
oh
well
i
know
all
thou
wouldst
say
to
what
boots
it
then
i
tell
thee
thou
must
go
that
thou
must
go
yea
dost
thou
think
i
have
thee
die
men
like
these
for
such
an
one
as
i
no
no
thy
life
is
clean
thou
shalt
not
cast
away
thy
clean
life
for
my
soiled
one
go
i
pray
xxxiv
she
ceased
i
spoke
i
know
not
what
it
was
then
took
her
hand
and
kissed
it
and
so
said
thou
art
my
promised
wife
thou
hast
no
cause
that
is
not
mine
i
love
thee
we
will
wed
i
love
thee
come
a
moment
did
she
pause
then
shook
her
head
and
sighed
my
heart
is
dead
this
can
not
be
behold
that
way
is
thine
i
will
not
let
thee
share
this
way
that
mine
xxxv
then
turning
from
me
ere
i
could
prevent
passed
like
a
shadow
from
the
shadowy
room
leaving
my
soul
in
shadow
naught
was
meant
by
my
sweet
flower
of
love
then
bloom
by
bloom
i
watched
it
wither
then
its
fragrance
went
and
naught
was
left
it
was
dark
as
doom
and
bells
were
tolling
far
off
through
the
rain
when
from
that
house
i
turned
my
face
again
xxxvi
then
in
the
night
a
trumpet
and
the
dull
close
thud
of
horse
and
clash
of
puritan
arms
and
glimmering
helms
swept
by
me
sorrowful
i
stood
and
waited
till
upon
the
black
breast
the
manse
a
burning
carbuncle
blazed
like
a
and
alarms
of
onslaught
clanged
around
it
then
like
one
who
bears
with
him
god
curse
i
galloped
on
the
forester
i
met
him
here
at
ammendorf
one
spring
it
was
the
end
of
april
and
the
harz
veined
to
their
summits
seemed
one
pulse
of
tender
green
and
delicate
gold
beneath
a
heaven
that
was
like
the
face
of
girlhood
waking
into
motherhood
along
the
furrowed
meadow
freshly
ploughed
the
patient
oxen
loamy
to
the
knees
plodded
or
lowed
or
snuffed
the
fragrant
soil
and
in
each
thorntree
hedge
the
wild
bird
sang
a
song
to
spring
made
of
its
own
wild
heart
and
soul
that
heard
the
heart
beating
like
a
star
at
break
of
day
as
kissing
ripe
the
blossoms
she
drew
near
her
mouth
sweet
rose
all
and
perfume
here
at
this
inn
and
underneath
this
tree
we
took
our
wine
the
morning
prismed
in
its
a
goodly
vintage
that
tang
with
the
ripeness
of
full
twenty
years
rare
i
remember
wine
that
spurred
the
blood
that
brought
the
heart
glad
to
the
limbered
lip
and
made
the
eyes
unlatticed
casements
where
a
man
true
soul
you
could
not
help
but
see
as
royal
a
rhenish
i
will
vouch
to
say
as
that
old
legends
tell
which
necromance
and
magic
keep
in
huge
casks
of
antique
make
deep
in
the
kyffhäuser
the
cellar
of
the
knights
near
so
solaced
of
that
wine
we
sat
an
hour
he
told
me
his
intent
in
coming
here
his
name
was
rudolf
and
his
native
home
franconia
but
no
word
of
parentage
only
his
mind
to
don
the
buff
and
green
and
live
a
forester
with
us
and
be
enfellowed
in
the
duke
of
brunswick
train
and
for
the
duke
estate
even
now
was
bound
tall
was
he
for
his
age
and
strong
and
brown
and
lithe
of
limb
and
with
a
face
that
seemed
hope
counterpart
but
with
the
eyes
of
doubt
deep
restless
disks
instinct
with
gleaming
night
that
seemed
to
say
we
sure
of
earth
at
least
for
some
short
space
my
friend
but
afterward
nay
ransack
not
till
lest
it
engulf
thy
joy
before
it
is
and
when
he
spoke
the
fire
in
his
eyes
worked
stealthy
as
a
hunted
animal
or
like
the
count
von
hackelnburg
that
turn
feeling
the
unseen
presence
of
a
fiend
then
as
it
chanced
old
kurt
had
come
that
morn
with
some
six
of
his
jerkined
foresters
from
the
thuringian
forest
wet
with
dew
and
fresh
as
morn
with
early
travel
bound
for
brunswick
dummburg
and
the
hakel
passed
chief
huntsman
he
then
to
our
lord
the
duke
and
father
of
the
loveliest
maiden
here
in
ammendorf
the
sunny
ilsabe
her
mother
dead
the
father
prized
his
daughter
more
than
all
that
men
hold
dear
his
only
happiness
who
was
beloved
of
all
as
lora
of
thuringia
was
for
gentle
ways
that
spoke
a
noble
soul
winning
all
hearts
to
love
her
and
to
praise
as
might
a
great
and
beautiful
thought
that
holds
us
by
the
simplest
her
eyes
were
blue
as
the
high
influence
of
a
summer
day
her
hair
serene
and
braided
over
brows
white
as
a
harz
dove
wing
was
auburn
brown
and
deep
as
mists
the
sun
has
drenched
with
gold
and
her
young
presence
well
was
like
a
song
a
far
tyrolean
melody
of
love
heard
on
an
alpine
path
at
close
of
day
when
shepherds
homeward
lead
their
tinkling
flocks
and
when
she
left
being
with
you
awhile
how
shall
i
say
it
was
as
when
one
hath
beheld
an
undine
by
the
moonlit
rhine
who
ere
the
mind
adjusts
a
thought
is
gone
and
in
your
soul
you
wonder
if
a
dream
some
thirty
years
ago
it
was
and
i
commissioner
of
the
duke
no
sinecure
i
can
assure
you
had
scarce
reached
the
age
of
thirty
that
we
sat
here
at
our
wine
and
was
through
me
that
rudolf
whom
at
first
from
some
rash
words
dropped
then
in
argument
the
foresterhood
was
like
to
be
denied
was
then
enfellowed
yes
said
i
he
young
kurt
he
is
young
but
see
a
wiry
frame
a
chamois
footing
and
a
face
for
deeds
an
eye
that
likes
me
not
too
quick
to
turn
but
that
may
be
the
restless
soul
within
a
soul
perhaps
with
virtues
that
have
been
severely
tried
and
could
not
stand
the
test
these
be
thy
care
kurt
and
if
not
too
deep
in
vices
of
the
flesh
discover
them
as
divers
bring
lost
riches
up
from
ooze
thou
hast
a
daughter
let
him
be
thy
son
a
year
thereafter
was
it
that
i
heard
of
rudolf
passion
for
kurt
ilsabe
then
their
betrothal
and
it
was
from
this
good
mother
mary
how
she
haunts
me
still
sweet
ilsabe
whose
higher
womanhood
true
as
the
touchstone
which
philosophers
feign
transmutes
to
gold
base
metals
it
may
touch
had
turned
to
good
all
evil
in
this
man
surmised
i
of
the
excellency
which
refinement
of
her
purer
company
and
contact
with
her
innocence
had
resolved
his
fiery
nature
to
conditioning
slave
and
so
i
came
from
brunswick
as
you
know
is
custom
of
the
duke
or
by
his
seal
commissioned
proxy
his
commissioner
to
test
the
marksmanship
of
rudolf
who
succeeded
kurt
with
marriage
of
his
child
an
heir
of
he
greatgrandfather
of
kurt
and
of
this
forestkeepership
the
first
possessor
thus
established
here
or
this
the
tale
they
tell
on
winter
nights
kuno
once
in
the
knight
of
wippach
train
rode
on
a
grand
hunt
with
the
duke
who
came
grandfather
of
the
father
of
our
duke
with
much
magnificence
of
knights
and
squires
great
nobles
cloaked
and
plumed
to
hunt
thuringian
deer
then
morn
too
quick
to
bid
was
too
slow
for
these
and
on
the
hills
recumbent
yawned
disturbed
an
hour
too
soon
all
like
some
young
milkmaid
whom
the
cock
hath
roused
who
sits
and
rubs
stiff
eyes
that
still
will
close
horns
sang
and
tugged
a
whimpering
leash
or
loosened
bounded
through
the
baying
glens
and
ere
the
mountain
mists
compact
of
white
broke
wild
before
the
azure
spears
of
day
the
hunt
that
woke
the
woods
to
life
seemed
but
the
of
the
ancient
hills
and
then
near
noon
within
a
forest
brake
the
roused
a
red
gigantic
stag
lashed
to
whose
back
with
cords
and
borne
along
like
some
pale
parasite
a
man
shrieked
and
wild
hair
a
mane
of
the
man
himself
emaciated
and
from
the
stag
mad
flight
through
headlong
rocks
and
trees
one
bleeding
bruise
with
eyes
like
holes
of
fire
for
such
the
law
then
when
the
peasant
chased
or
slew
the
dun
deer
of
his
tyrant
lords
if
seized
as
punishment
the
withes
and
spine
of
some
strong
stag
a
gift
to
him
of
game
enough
till
death
death
in
the
antlered
herd
or
slow
starvation
in
the
haggard
hills
then
was
the
great
duke
glad
and
forthwith
cried
to
all
his
hunting
train
a
rich
reward
for
him
who
slew
the
stag
and
saved
the
man
but
death
for
him
who
slew
both
man
and
stag
so
plunged
the
hunt
after
the
hurrying
slot
a
shout
and
glimmer
through
the
sounding
woods
like
some
mad
torrent
that
the
hills
have
loosed
with
death
for
was
late
and
none
had
risked
that
shot
as
yet
too
desperate
the
risk
beside
the
poor
life
and
a
little
gold
when
this
young
kuno
with
fierce
eyes
wherein
hunt
and
impatience
kindled
reckless
flame
cried
has
the
dew
then
made
our
powder
wet
or
have
we
left
our
marksmanship
at
home
here
for
its
heart
the
fiend
direct
my
ball
and
fired
into
a
covert
deeply
packed
an
intertangled
wall
of
matted
night
wherein
the
eye
might
vainly
strive
and
strive
to
pierce
one
fathom
earn
one
foot
beyond
but
ha
the
huge
stag
staggered
from
the
brake
hit
full
i
the
heart
and
that
wan
wretch
unbound
was
and
cared
for
then
his
grace
the
duke
charmed
with
the
eagle
aim
called
kuno
up
and
there
to
him
and
his
forever
gave
the
forestkeepership
but
envious
tongues
were
soon
at
wag
and
whispered
went
the
tale
of
how
the
shot
was
free
and
how
the
balls
used
by
young
kuno
were
free
bullets
which
to
say
is
lead
by
magic
moulded
in
the
influence
and
directed
of
the
fiend
of
some
effect
these
tales
and
had
some
force
even
with
the
duke
who
lent
an
ear
so
far
as
to
ordain
kuno
descendants
all
to
proof
of
skill
ere
their
succession
to
the
father
office
kurt
himself
hath
shot
the
silver
ring
out
o
the
popinjay
beak
a
good
shot
he
you
see
who
would
succeed
of
these
enchanted
bullets
let
me
speak
there
may
be
such
our
earth
has
things
as
strange
perhaps
and
stranger
that
we
doubt
not
of
while
we
behold
not
only
the
thatch
of
ignorance
hovel
but
within
the
pictured
halls
of
wisdom
palaces
how
superstition
sits
an
honored
guest
a
let
it
be
among
the
hills
a
in
a
solitude
of
pines
and
on
the
lonely
you
must
draw
a
circle
with
a
bloody
sword
and
round
the
circle
runic
characters
gaunt
and
satanic
here
a
skull
and
there
a
scythe
and
and
an
here
and
in
the
centre
fed
with
from
the
grave
of
one
a
murderer
a
smouldering
fire
eleven
of
the
clock
the
first
ball
leaves
the
mold
the
sullen
lead
mixed
with
three
bullets
that
have
hit
their
mark
and
blood
the
wounded
sacramental
host
stolen
and
hence
unhallowed
oozed
when
shot
fixed
to
a
riven
pine
ere
twelve
with
never
a
word
until
that
hour
sound
must
all
the
balls
be
cast
and
these
must
be
in
number
three
and
sixty
three
of
which
the
fiend
dark
agent
demon
sammael
claims
for
his
master
and
stamps
for
his
own
to
hit
aside
their
mark
askew
for
harm
the
other
sixty
shall
not
miss
their
mark
no
cry
no
word
no
whisper
even
though
vague
gesturing
shapes
that
loom
like
moonlit
mists
their
faces
human
but
with
animal
forms
rise
thick
around
and
threaten
to
destroy
no
cry
no
word
no
whisper
should
there
come
weeping
a
wandering
shadow
like
the
girl
you
love
or
loved
now
lost
to
you
her
eyes
hollow
with
tears
all
palely
beckoning
with
beautiful
arms
or
censuring
her
face
sad
with
a
desolate
love
who
if
you
speak
or
waver
from
that
circle
hideous
change
shrinks
to
a
wrinkled
hag
whose
harpy
hands
shall
tear
you
limb
from
limb
with
horrible
mirth
nor
be
deceived
if
some
far
midnight
bell
strike
that
anticipated
hour
nor
leave
by
one
short
inch
the
circle
for
unseen
though
now
they
be
hell
minions
still
are
there
watching
with
flaming
eyes
to
seize
your
soul
but
when
the
hour
of
midnight
sounds
be
sure
you
have
your
bullets
neither
more
nor
less
for
if
through
fear
one
more
or
less
you
have
your
soul
is
forfeit
to
hell
then
while
the
hour
of
midnight
strikes
will
come
a
noise
of
galloping
hoofs
and
outriders
shouting
six
midnight
steeds
their
nostrils
pits
of
burning
blood
postilioned
roll
a
stage
black
and
with
groaning
wheels
of
spinning
fire
room
there
ho
ho
who
bars
the
on
over
him
but
fear
not
nor
fare
forth
is
but
the
last
trick
of
your
bounden
slave
and
ere
the
red
moon
rushes
through
the
clouds
and
dives
again
high
the
huge
leaders
leap
their
fire
and
their
flame
and
spun
a
spiral
spark
into
the
night
whistling
the
phantom
flies
and
fades
away
some
say
there
comes
no
stage
that
hackelnburg
of
the
harz
comes
dark
as
storm
with
rain
and
wind
and
demon
dogs
of
hell
the
terror
of
his
an
owl
and
the
dim
deer
he
hunts
rush
on
before
the
forests
crash
and
whirlwinds
are
the
leaves
and
all
the
skies
as
he
hurls
straight
on
the
circle
horse
and
hounds
and
stag
and
at
the
last
there
comes
upon
a
stallion
gaunt
and
lurid
black
the
minister
of
satan
sammael
who
greets
you
and
informs
you
and
assures
enough
these
told
to
what
i
seen
to
ammendorf
i
came
and
rudolf
here
with
kurt
and
his
assembled
men
i
met
the
abundant
year
like
some
sweet
wife
at
her
brown
baby
autumn
in
her
arms
stood
the
garnered
harvests
of
her
fields
dreaming
of
days
that
pass
like
almoners
scattering
their
alms
in
minted
gold
of
flowers
of
nights
that
forest
all
the
skies
with
stars
wherethrough
the
moon
huntress
rides
one
cloud
before
her
like
a
flying
fawn
then
i
proposed
the
season
hunt
till
eve
the
test
of
rudolf
skill
postponed
at
which
he
seemed
impatient
and
was
then
i
heard
how
he
an
execrable
marksman
was
and
tales
that
told
of
near
incredible
shots
that
missed
their
mark
or
how
his
oft
flashed
harmless
powder
while
the
curious
deer
stood
staring
as
in
pity
of
such
aim
bidding
him
try
his
marksmanship
again
howbeit
he
that
day
acquitted
him
of
all
this
gossip
in
that
day
long
hunt
missing
no
shot
however
rashly
made
or
distant
through
the
intercepting
trees
and
the
piled
various
game
brought
down
of
all
good
marksmen
of
kurt
train
had
not
sufficed
doubled
nay
trebled
there
to
match
his
heap
and
marvelling
the
hunters
saw
nor
knew
how
to
excuse
them
my
indulgence
some
told
me
that
but
yesterday
old
kurt
had
made
his
daughter
weep
and
rudolf
frown
by
vowing
end
to
their
betrothéd
love
unless
that
love
developed
better
aim
against
the
morrow
test
his
high
fame
should
not
be
tarnished
so
he
railed
and
bowed
his
gray
head
and
sat
moodily
but
looking
up
forgave
all
when
he
saw
tears
in
his
daughter
eyes
and
rudolf
gone
out
in
the
night
black
with
approaching
storm
before
this
inn
yonder
and
here
they
stood
the
holiday
village
come
to
view
the
trial
fair
maidens
and
their
comely
mothers
with
their
sweethearts
and
their
husbands
and
i
marked
kurt
and
his
daughter
here
his
florid
face
all
jubilant
at
rudolf
great
success
hers
radiant
with
happiness
for
this
her
marriage
eve
so
had
her
father
said
should
rudolf
come
successful
from
the
hunt
so
pleased
was
i
with
what
i
seen
him
do
the
trial
of
skill
superfluous
seemed
and
so
was
on
the
bare
brink
of
announcing
when
out
of
the
western
heaven
deepening
red
like
a
white
message
dropped
by
rosy
lips
a
wild
dove
clove
the
luminous
winds
and
there
upon
that
limb
a
peaceful
moment
sat
then
i
thy
rifle
rudolf
pierce
its
head
cried
pointing
and
art
thou
why
did
he
falter
with
a
face
as
strange
as
a
dark
omen
did
his
soul
foresee
what
was
to
be
with
tragic
prescience
what
a
bad
dream
it
all
seems
now
again
i
see
him
aim
again
i
hear
the
cry
my
dove
o
rudolf
do
not
kill
my
dove
and
from
the
crowd
like
some
sweet
dove
herself
a
fluttering
whiteness
came
our
ilsabe
too
late
the
rifle
cracked
the
unhurt
dove
rose
beating
frightened
wings
but
ilsabe
the
sight
the
sight
lay
smitten
a
red
stain
sullying
the
pureness
of
her
bridal
bodice
showed
where
the
ball
had
pierced
her
through
the
heart
and
rudolf
ah
of
him
you
still
would
know
when
he
beheld
this
thing
that
he
had
done
why
he
went
mad
i
say
but
others
not
an
hour
he
raved
of
how
her
life
had
paid
for
the
unholy
bullets
he
had
used
and
how
his
soul
was
three
times
lost
and
damned
i
say
that
he
went
mad
and
fled
forthwith
into
the
haunted
some
say
to
die
the
prey
of
demons
of
the
dummburg
ruin
i
one
of
those
less
superstitious
say
he
in
the
bodé
from
that
blackened
rock
whereon
were
found
his
and
gun
the
devil
dancing
place
did
leap
and
die
my
lady
of
verne
it
all
comes
back
as
the
end
draws
near
all
comes
back
like
a
tale
of
old
shall
i
tell
you
all
will
you
lend
an
ear
you
with
your
face
so
stern
and
cold
you
who
have
found
me
dying
here
lady
leona
villa
at
verne
you
have
walked
its
terraces
where
the
fount
and
statue
gleam
and
the
fluted
urn
its
elms
that
are
avenues
gaunt
of
shadow
and
flame
when
the
west
is
is
a
lonely
region
of
tarns
and
trees
and
hollow
hills
that
circle
the
west
haunted
of
rooks
and
the
immemorial
vague
unrest
a
land
of
sorrowful
memories
a
gray
sad
land
where
the
wind
has
its
will
and
the
sun
its
way
with
the
fruits
and
flowers
where
ever
the
one
all
night
is
shrill
and
ever
the
other
all
day
brings
hours
of
glimmering
silence
that
dead
days
fill
a
gray
sad
land
where
her
girlhood
grew
to
womanhood
proud
that
the
seemed
to
give
their
heart
like
melody
to
and
the
stars
their
soul
like
a
dream
undreamed
the
only
glad
thing
that
the
sad
land
knew
my
lady
you
know
how
nobly
born
haughty
of
form
with
a
head
that
rose
like
a
dream
of
empire
love
and
scorn
made
haunts
of
her
eyes
and
her
lips
were
bows
whence
pride
imperious
flashed
flower
and
thorn
and
i
oh
i
was
nobody
one
her
worshiper
only
who
chose
to
be
silent
seeing
that
love
alone
was
his
only
badge
of
nobility
set
in
his
heart
escutcheon
how
long
ago
does
the
springtime
look
when
we
wandered
away
to
the
hills
the
hills
like
the
land
in
the
tale
in
the
covered
with
gold
of
the
daffodils
and
gemmed
with
the
crocus
by
brae
and
brook
when
i
gathered
a
branch
from
a
hawthorn
tree
for
her
hair
or
bosom
from
boughs
that
hung
odorous
of
heaven
and
purity
and
she
thanked
me
smiling
then
merrily
sung
laughingly
sung
while
she
looked
at
me
there
dwelt
a
princess
over
the
sea
right
fair
was
she
right
fair
was
she
who
loved
a
squire
of
low
degree
but
married
a
king
of
brittany
ah
woe
is
me
and
it
came
to
pass
on
the
so
people
say
so
people
say
that
they
found
her
dead
in
her
bridal
array
dead
and
her
lover
beside
her
lay
ah
a
sour
stave
for
your
sweets
she
said
pressing
the
blossoms
against
her
lips
then
petal
by
petal
the
branch
she
shred
snowing
the
blooms
from
her
tossing
them
down
for
her
feet
to
tread
what
to
her
was
the
look
i
gave
of
love
despised
though
she
seemed
to
start
seeing
and
said
with
a
quick
why
one
would
think
that
was
your
heart
while
her
face
with
a
sudden
thought
grew
grave
but
i
answered
nothing
and
so
to
her
home
we
came
in
the
twilight
falling
clear
with
a
few
first
stars
and
a
moon
curved
foam
over
the
hush
of
meadow
and
mere
whence
the
boom
of
the
bittern
would
often
come
would
you
think
that
she
loved
me
who
can
say
what
a
riddle
unread
was
she
to
me
when
i
kissed
her
fingers
and
turned
away
i
wanted
to
speak
but
what
cared
she
though
her
eyes
looked
soft
and
she
begged
me
stay
though
she
lingered
to
watch
me
that
might
be
a
slim
or
the
evening
haze
but
never
my
lady
drapery
or
wistful
face
in
the
ivy
maze
leona
of
verne
why
what
cared
she
so
the
days
went
by
and
the
summer
wore
her
hot
heart
out
and
a
mighty
slayer
the
autumn
harried
the
land
and
shore
and
the
world
was
red
with
his
wrecks
but
grayer
that
land
with
the
ghosts
of
the
nevermore
the
sheaves
of
the
summer
had
long
been
bound
the
harvests
of
autumn
had
long
been
past
and
the
snows
of
the
winter
lay
deep
around
when
the
dark
news
came
and
i
knew
at
last
and
the
reigning
woe
of
my
heart
was
crowned
so
i
sought
her
here
the
young
earl
bride
in
the
ancient
room
at
the
oriel
dreaming
pale
as
the
blooms
in
her
hair
and
wide
her
robe
rich
satin
flung
stormily
gleaming
like
shimmering
silver
i
marked
as
i
stole
to
her
side
that
tears
were
vaguely
large
in
her
beautiful
eyes
that
the
loops
of
pearls
on
her
throat
and
years
old
lace
on
her
bosom
were
heaved
with
sighs
so
i
spoke
what
i
thought
then
it
appears
and
stopped
with
it
seemed
my
soul
in
my
gaze
that
you
are
not
happy
leona
of
verne
there
is
that
at
your
heart
which
well
betrays
these
mocking
live
and
learn
and
this
is
the
truth
that
the
poet
says
went
to
my
love
and
i
told
with
my
heart
in
words
of
the
soul
that
are
silent
in
speech
all
of
my
passion
too
sacred
for
art
but
she
heard
me
not
for
i
could
not
reach
her
in
that
world
of
which
she
is
part
that
world
where
i
saw
you
as
one
afar
sees
palms
and
waters
and
knows
that
sands
pitiless
sands
before
him
are
yet
follows
ever
with
helpless
hands
till
he
sinks
at
you
were
my
star
my
hope
my
heaven
i
loved
you
life
is
less
than
nothing
to
me
she
turned
with
a
wild
look
saying
now
i
am
his
wife
you
come
and
tell
me
indeed
you
are
in
the
language
of
hearts
that
unheard
a
knife
as
she
ceased
and
leaned
on
a
cabinet
a
curve
of
scintillant
steel
keen
cold
fell
icily
clashing
some
curio
met
among
asian
antiques
bronze
and
gold
mystical
curiously
graven
and
set
a
bactrian
dagger
whose
slightest
prick
through
its
ancient
poison
was
death
i
knew
if
true
that
she
loved
me
then
and
quick
to
the
unspoken
thought
she
replied
is
true
i
have
loved
you
long
and
my
soul
was
sick
sick
for
the
love
that
has
made
me
weak
weak
to
your
will
even
now
and
more
she
said
in
my
arms
that
i
shall
not
speak
and
the
dagger
there
on
the
polished
floor
ever
her
eyes
while
she
spoke
would
seek
it
came
to
pass
on
the
then
my
lips
for
a
moment
were
crushed
to
hers
they
found
her
dead
in
her
bridal
array
she
sang
then
said
you
finish
the
verse
finish
the
song
for
you
know
the
way
and
i
whispered
yes
for
my
mind
had
thought
her
own
thought
through
that
life
were
a
hell
to
her
as
to
me
so
the
blade
i
caught
with
a
sudden
hand
and
she
leaned
and
well
what
a
little
wound
and
the
blood
it
brought
to
crimson
her
bosom
i
set
her
there
in
that
carven
chair
then
turned
the
blade
with
its
glittering
haft
one
savage
glare
of
gold
and
jewels
wildly
inlaid
to
my
breast
for
the
poisonous
point
rent
bare
a
stain
of
blood
on
her
bosom
and
one
black
red
my
you
see
is
good
to
die
so
for
love
does
the
sinking
sun
through
the
dull
vast
west
burst
banked
with
blood
or
is
it
that
life
will
at
last
have
done
so
you
are
her
husband
and
well
you
see
you
see
she
is
dead
but
your
face
how
white
is
it
with
hate
or
with
misery
what
matters
it
now
for
at
last
the
night
falls
and
the
silence
covers
me
an
old
tale
from
the
terrace
here
where
the
hills
indent
you
can
see
the
uttermost
battlement
of
the
castle
there
the
cliffords
home
where
the
seasons
go
and
the
seasons
come
and
never
a
footstep
else
doth
fall
save
the
prowling
fox
the
ancient
hall
echoes
no
voice
save
the
owlet
call
its
turret
chambers
are
homes
for
the
bat
and
its
courts
are
tangled
and
wild
to
see
and
where
in
the
cellar
was
once
the
rat
the
viper
and
toad
move
stealthily
long
years
have
passed
since
the
place
was
burned
and
he
sailed
to
the
wars
in
france
and
earned
the
name
that
he
bears
of
the
bold
and
true
on
his
tomb
long
years
since
my
lord
sir
hugh
lived
and
i
was
his
favorite
page
and
the
thing
then
happened
and
he
of
an
age
when
a
man
will
love
and
be
loved
again
or
hie
to
the
wars
or
a
monastery
or
toil
till
he
conquer
his
heart
sore
pain
or
drink
and
forget
it
and
finally
bury
i
was
his
page
and
often
we
fared
through
the
clare
demesnes
in
autumn
hawking
if
the
baron
had
known
how
they
would
have
glared
their
bushy
brows
those
eyes
of
mocking
that
last
of
the
strongbows
richard
i
mean
and
growling
some
six
of
his
henchmen
lean
to
mount
and
after
this
clifford
and
hang
with
his
page
to
the
nearest
oak
how
he
would
have
cursed
us
while
he
spoke
for
clare
and
clifford
had
ever
a
fang
in
the
other
side
and
i
hear
the
clang
of
his
rage
in
the
hall
when
the
hawker
told
if
he
told
how
we
met
on
the
autumn
wold
his
daughter
sweet
clara
of
clare
the
day
her
hooded
tiercel
its
brails
did
burst
and
trailing
its
jesses
came
flying
our
way
an
untrained
haggard
the
falconer
cursed
while
he
tried
to
secure
as
the
eyas
flew
slant
low
and
heavily
over
us
hugh
who
saw
it
coming
and
had
just
then
cast
his
peregrine
hawk
at
a
heron
quarry
in
his
saddle
rising
so
as
it
passed
by
the
jesses
caught
and
to
her
did
carry
where
she
stood
near
the
wood
her
face
flushed
rose
with
the
glad
of
the
meeting
no
two
foes
her
eyes
and
my
lord
i
swear
who
saw
was
love
from
the
start
and
i
heard
him
speak
some
words
then
he
knelt
and
the
sombre
shaw
with
the
rust
of
the
autumn
waste
and
bleak
grew
spring
with
her
smile
as
the
hawk
she
took
on
her
lily
wrist
where
it
pruned
and
shook
its
ragged
wings
then
i
saw
him
seize
the
hand
that
she
reached
to
him
long
and
white
as
she
smilingly
bade
him
rise
from
his
knees
when
he
kissed
its
fingers
her
eyes
grew
bright
but
her
cheeks
grew
pallid
when
lashing
through
the
woodland
there
with
a
face
with
the
sting
of
the
wind
and
his
gipsy
hair
flying
the
falconer
came
and
two
or
three
of
the
people
of
castle
clare
and
the
leaves
of
the
autumn
made
a
frame
for
the
picture
there
in
the
morning
flame
what
was
said
in
that
moment
i
do
not
know
that
moment
of
meeting
between
those
lovers
but
whatever
it
was
was
whispered
low
and
soft
as
a
leaf
that
swings
and
hovers
a
twinkling
gold
when
the
leaves
are
yellow
and
her
face
with
the
joy
was
still
aglow
when
down
through
the
wood
that
burly
fellow
came
with
his
frown
and
made
a
pause
in
the
pulse
of
their
words
my
lord
sir
hugh
stood
with
the
soil
on
his
knee
no
cause
had
he
but
his
hanger
he
partly
drew
then
clapped
it
sharp
in
its
sheath
again
and
bowed
to
my
lady
and
strode
away
and
mounting
his
horse
with
a
swinging
rein
rode
with
a
song
in
his
heart
all
day
he
loved
and
was
loved
i
knew
for
look
all
other
sports
for
the
chase
he
forsook
and
strange
that
he
never
went
to
hawk
or
hunt
but
clara
would
meet
him
there
in
the
strongbow
forest
i
know
the
rock
with
its
moss
by
the
bramble
lair
were
oft
and
again
he
met
by
chance
shall
i
say
the
daughter
of
clare
as
fair
of
face
as
a
queen
in
an
old
romance
who
waits
with
her
sweet
face
pale
her
hair
and
eyes
with
dreams
by
the
where
the
statue
gleams
and
the
moonbeam
lolls
in
the
lily
white
for
the
knightly
lover
who
comes
at
night
heigho
they
ceased
those
meetings
i
wot
betrayed
to
the
baron
by
some
of
his
crew
of
menials
who
followed
and
saw
and
knew
for
she
loved
too
well
to
have
once
forgot
the
time
and
the
place
of
their
trysting
true
why
and
when
would
ask
sir
hugh
in
the
labored
letters
he
used
to
lock
the
lovers
post
in
a
coigne
of
that
rock
she
used
to
answer
but
now
did
not
but
nearing
yule
love
got
them
again
a
twilight
tryst
through
frowardness
sure
they
met
and
that
day
was
gray
with
rain
or
snow
and
the
wind
did
ever
endure
a
long
bleak
moaning
thorough
the
wood
that
chapped
i
the
cheek
and
smarted
the
blood
and
a
brook
in
the
forest
went
throb
and
throb
and
over
it
all
was
the
sob
of
the
rushing
boughs
like
a
thing
pursued
and
then
it
was
that
he
learned
how
she
god
blood
how
it
makes
my
old
limbs
quiver
to
think
what
a
miserable
tyrant
he
the
baron
richard
aye
and
ever
to
his
daughter
was
forsooth
must
wed
with
an
eastern
earl
a
lovell
to
whom
would
god
o
his
mercy
had
struck
him
dead
clara
of
clare
when
only
a
child
with
a
face
like
a
flower
that
blooms
in
the
wild
of
the
hills
and
a
soul
like
its
soft
perfume
was
given
to
seal
or
strengthen
some
ties
of
power
and
wealth
say
bartered
then
like
the
merest
chattel
with
tearful
eyes
and
trembling
lips
she
spoke
and
when
her
lover
the
clifford
had
learned
and
heard
he
have
had
her
flee
with
him
then
in
spite
of
them
all
let
her
speak
the
word
they
would
fly
together
the
baron
men
might
follow
and
if
and
he
touched
his
sword
it
should
answer
but
she
while
she
seemed
to
stay
with
a
hand
on
her
bosom
her
heart
quick
breath
replied
to
his
heat
they
would
take
and
slay
thee
who
art
life
of
me
no
not
thus
shall
we
fly
there
another
way
for
us
a
way
that
is
sure
an
only
way
i
have
thought
it
out
this
many
a
day
the
words
that
she
spoke
how
well
i
remember
as
well
as
the
mood
o
that
day
of
december
that
bullied
and
blustered
and
seemed
in
league
like
a
spiteful
shrew
with
the
wind
and
snow
to
drown
the
words
of
their
sweet
intrigue
with
the
boom
of
the
boughs
tossed
to
and
fro
her
last
words
these
by
curfew
sure
on
christmas
eve
at
the
postern
door
and
we
were
there
with
a
led
horse
too
armed
for
a
journey
i
hardly
knew
whither
but
why
you
well
can
guess
for
often
he
whispered
a
certain
name
the
talisman
of
his
happiness
that
warmed
his
blood
like
a
flame
while
we
waited
there
till
its
owner
came
we
saw
how
the
castle
baronial
girth
like
a
giant
loosed
for
reveling
more
shone
and
we
heard
the
wassail
and
mirth
where
the
mistletoe
hung
in
the
hearth
red
roar
and
the
holly
brightened
the
weaponed
wall
of
ancient
oak
in
the
banqueting
hall
and
the
spits
i
trow
by
the
scullions
turned
the
snoring
logs
rich
steamed
and
burned
while
the
whole
and
the
deer
were
roasted
and
the
half
of
an
ox
and
the
haunches
while
tuns
of
ale
that
the
cellars
boasted
and
casks
of
sack
were
broached
for
paunches
of
vassals
who
reveled
in
stable
and
hall
the
song
of
the
minstrel
the
yeomen
quarrel
the
dice
and
the
drink
and
the
huntsman
bawl
in
the
baying
kennels
its
hounds
the
bones
of
the
banquet
now
loud
now
low
we
could
hear
where
we
crouched
in
the
drifting
snow
was
she
long
did
she
come
by
the
postern
we
like
shadows
waited
my
lord
sir
hugh
spoke
pointing
a
tower
that
casement
see
when
a
stealthy
light
in
its
slit
burns
blue
and
signals
thrice
slowly
thus
is
she
and
close
to
his
breast
his
gaberdine
drew
for
the
wind
it
whipped
and
the
snow
beat
through
did
she
come
we
had
waited
an
hour
or
twain
when
the
taper
flashed
in
the
central
pane
and
flourished
three
times
and
vanished
so
and
under
the
arch
of
the
postern
portal
holding
the
horses
we
stood
in
the
snow
stiff
with
the
cold
ah
me
immortal
minutes
we
waited
and
listened
shivering
there
in
the
hiss
of
the
gale
the
parapets
whistled
the
angles
glistened
and
the
night
around
seemed
one
black
wail
of
death
whose
ominous
presence
over
the
stormy
battlements
seemed
to
hover
said
my
lord
sir
hugh
to
himself
he
spoke
she
feels
for
the
spring
in
the
sliding
panel
the
arras
hid
in
the
carven
oak
it
opens
the
stair
like
a
well
dark
channel
yawns
and
the
draught
makes
her
taper
slope
wrapped
deep
in
her
mantle
she
stoops
now
puts
one
foot
on
the
stair
now
a
listening
pause
as
nearer
and
nearer
the
mad
search
draws
of
the
thwarted
castle
no
smallest
hope
that
they
find
her
now
that
the
panel
shuts
if
the
wind
that
howls
like
a
tortured
thing
would
throttle
itself
with
itself
then
i
might
hear
how
her
hurrying
footsteps
ring
down
the
hollow
there
is
her
fingers
try
the
postern
bolts
that
the
rust
makes
cling
but
ever
some
whim
of
the
storm
that
shook
a
clanging
ring
or
a
creaking
hook
in
buttress
or
wall
and
we
waited
numb
with
the
cold
till
dawn
but
she
did
not
come
i
must
tell
you
why
and
have
done
is
said
on
the
brink
of
the
marriage
she
fled
the
side
of
the
guests
and
the
bridegroom
there
she
fled
with
a
mischievous
laugh
i
hide
i
hide
seek
and
be
sure
that
you
find
so
led
a
long
search
after
her
but
defied
all
search
for
a
score
and
ten
long
years
well
the
laughter
of
yule
was
turned
to
tears
for
them
and
for
us
we
saw
the
glare
of
torches
that
hurried
from
chamber
to
stair
and
we
heard
the
castle
her
name
but
neither
to
them
nor
to
us
she
came
and
that
was
the
last
of
clara
of
clare
that
winter
it
was
a
month
thereafter
that
the
home
of
the
cliffords
roof
and
rafter
i
could
swear
was
the
strongbow
doing
were
i
sure
that
he
knew
of
the
clifford
wooing
his
daughter
and
so
by
the
rood
and
cross
had
burned
hugh
home
to
avenge
his
so
over
the
channel
to
france
with
his
king
the
black
prince
sailed
to
the
wars
to
deaden
the
ache
of
the
mystery
hugh
that
spring
and
fell
at
poitiers
for
his
loss
made
leaden
his
heart
and
his
life
was
a
weary
sadness
so
he
flung
it
away
in
a
moment
madness
and
the
baron
died
and
the
bridegroom
well
unlucky
was
he
in
truth
to
tell
of
him
there
is
nothing
the
baron
died
the
last
of
the
strongbows
he
gramercy
and
the
clare
estate
with
its
wealth
and
pride
devolved
to
the
bloets
walter
and
percy
and
years
went
by
and
it
happened
that
they
ransacked
the
old
castle
and
so
one
day
in
a
lonesome
tower
uprummaged
a
chest
from
flanders
of
ebon
and
wildly
carved
all
over
with
things
a
sinister
crest
and
evil
faces
distorted
and
starved
with
a
spring
which
they
forced
and
lo
when
they
opened
it
death
like
a
lady
dressed
grinned
up
at
their
terror
but
no
not
so
a
skeleton
jeweled
and
laced
and
wreathed
with
flowers
of
dust
and
a
miniver
around
it
clasped
that
the
ruin
sheathed
of
a
once
rich
raiment
of
silk
and
fur
i
have
given
my
life
to
hear
him
tell
the
courtly
clifford
how
this
befell
he
have
known
how
it
was
for
you
see
in
groping
for
the
secret
spring
of
that
panel
hoping
and
fearing
as
nearer
and
nearer
drew
the
search
of
retainers
why
out
she
blew
the
taper
and
seeing
this
chest
would
hide
her
a
minute
in
it
mayhap
till
the
hurry
had
passed
but
the
pressed
by
the
lid
great
weight
closed
fast
with
a
snap
ere
her
heart
was
aware
of
the
fiendish
trap
the
water
witch
see
the
doe
is
wounded
he
will
follow
as
it
bounds
through
the
woods
his
horn
has
sounded
echoing
for
his
men
and
hounds
but
no
answering
bugle
blew
he
has
lost
his
retinue
for
the
shapely
deer
that
bounded
past
him
when
his
bow
he
drew
not
one
hound
or
huntsman
follows
through
the
underbrush
and
moss
goes
the
slot
and
in
the
hollows
of
the
hills
that
he
must
cross
he
has
lost
it
he
must
fare
over
rocks
where
lair
where
the
wallows
so
he
leaves
his
good
steed
there
through
his
mind
then
flashed
an
olden
legend
told
him
by
the
monks
of
a
girl
whose
hair
is
golden
haunting
fountains
and
the
trunks
of
the
woodland
who
they
say
is
a
white
doe
all
the
day
but
when
woods
are
turns
into
an
evil
fay
then
the
story
oft
his
teacher
told
him
of
a
mountain
lake
demons
dwell
in
vague
of
feature
but
each
a
snake
she
is
queen
did
he
hear
laughter
at
his
startled
ear
or
a
bird
and
now
what
creature
is
it
or
the
wind
stirs
near
fever
of
the
hunt
this
water
murmuring
here
will
cool
his
head
through
the
forest
fierce
as
slaughter
slants
the
sunset
ruby
red
are
the
drops
that
slip
between
his
cupped
hands
while
on
the
green
like
the
couch
of
some
wild
daughter
of
the
forest
he
doth
lean
but
the
runnel
bubbling
dripping
seems
to
bid
him
to
be
gone
as
with
crystal
words
and
tripping
steps
of
sparkle
luring
on
now
a
spirit
in
the
rocks
calls
him
now
a
face
that
mocks
from
behind
some
bowlder
slipping
laughs
at
him
with
lilied
locks
so
he
follows
through
the
flowers
blue
and
gold
that
blossom
there
thridding
bowers
where
each
ripple
seems
the
bare
beauty
of
white
limbs
that
gleam
rosy
through
the
running
stream
or
hair
that
showers
starlight
in
the
sunset
beam
till
far
in
the
forest
sleeping
like
a
luminous
darkness
lay
a
deep
water
wherein
leaping
fell
the
fountain
of
the
fay
with
a
singing
sighing
sound
as
of
spirit
things
around
musically
laughing
weeping
in
the
air
and
underground
not
a
ripple
it
merried
like
the
round
moon
a
cloud
in
its
rocks
the
lake
lay
buried
and
strange
creatures
seemed
to
crowd
its
dark
depths
vague
limbs
and
eyes
to
the
surface
seemed
to
rise
and
as
formless
ferried
through
the
water
foliage
things
with
human
faces
pale
and
wild
as
the
forms
the
lightning
traces
on
the
clouds
the
storm
has
piled
seeming
now
to
draw
to
land
now
away
then
up
the
strand
comes
a
woman
and
she
places
on
his
arm
a
hand
ah
an
untold
world
of
sorrow
were
her
eyes
her
hair
a
place
whence
the
moon
its
gold
might
borrow
and
a
dream
of
ice
her
face
her
hair
and
throat
in
rims
pearls
of
foam
hung
and
through
whims
of
her
robe
as
breaks
the
morrow
shone
the
of
her
limbs
who
could
help
but
look
with
gladness
on
such
beauty
though
within
deep
within
the
beryl
sadness
of
those
eyes
the
serpent
sin
coil
when
she
hath
placed
her
cheek
chilly
upon
his
and
weak
with
love
longing
and
its
madness
is
his
will
grown
then
she
speak
dost
thou
love
me
if
surrender
is
to
love
thee
then
i
love
hast
no
fear
then
in
the
splendor
of
thy
gaze
who
knows
thereof
yet
i
fear
i
fear
to
lose
thee
thy
love
and
thou
dost
choose
aye
to
be
my
heart
defender
take
me
i
am
thine
to
use
follow
then
ah
love
no
lowly
home
i
give
thee
with
fixed
eyes
to
the
water
edge
she
slowly
drew
him
and
he
did
surmise
was
her
lips
on
his
until
his
face
the
foam
closed
chill
and
the
lake
unholy
rippled
rippled
and
was
still
at
nineveh
written
for
my
friend
walter
mathews
there
was
a
princess
once
who
loved
the
slave
of
an
assyrian
king
her
father
known
at
nineveh
as
hadria
whose
grave
the
sands
of
centuries
have
long
been
blown
yet
sooner
shall
the
night
forget
its
stars
than
love
her
story
how
unto
his
throne
one
day
she
came
where
with
his
warriors
the
king
sat
in
the
hall
of
audience
pillared
trophies
of
barbaric
wars
and
kneeling
to
him
asked
o
father
whence
comes
love
and
why
he
smiling
on
her
said
o
hadria
love
is
of
the
gods
and
hence
divine
is
only
but
why
love
is
ah
child
we
do
not
know
unless
is
love
that
gives
us
life
when
dead
and
then
his
daughter
with
a
face
aglow
with
all
the
love
that
clamored
in
her
blood
its
sweet
avowal
lifted
arms
of
snow
and
like
aurora
rose
before
him
stood
saying
since
love
is
of
the
powers
above
i
love
a
slave
o
asshur
let
the
good
the
gods
have
be
sanctioned
speak
not
of
dishonor
and
our
line
ancestral
dead
they
are
imperial
dust
i
live
and
love
black
as
black
storm
then
rose
the
king
and
said
a
lightning
gesture
at
her
standing
there
enough
ho
rhana
strike
me
off
her
head
and
at
the
mandate
with
his
limbs
half
bare
a
slave
strode
forth
majestic
was
his
form
as
some
young
god
he
gathering
up
her
hair
wound
it
three
times
around
his
sinewy
arm
then
drew
his
sword
it
for
one
moment
shone
a
semicircling
light
and
dripping
warm
lifting
the
head
he
stood
before
the
throne
then
cried
the
despot
by
the
horn
of
bel
this
was
no
child
of
mine
like
chiselled
stone
still
stood
the
slave
a
son
of
israel
then
striding
towards
the
monarch
in
his
eye
the
wrath
of
heaven
and
the
hate
of
hell
shrieked
lust
i
loved
her
look
on
us
and
die
swifter
than
fire
clove
him
to
the
brain
then
kissed
the
dead
fair
face
of
her
held
high
and
crying
judge
o
god
between
us
twain
a
thousand
daggers
in
his
heart
fell
slain
how
they
brought
aid
to
bryan
station
during
the
siege
of
bryan
station
kentucky
august
nicholas
tomlinson
and
thomas
bell
two
inhabitants
of
the
fort
undertook
to
ride
through
the
besieging
indian
and
tory
lines
to
lexington
for
aid
it
happened
also
during
this
siege
that
the
pioneer
women
of
the
fort
when
the
water
supply
was
exhausted
heroically
carried
water
from
a
spring
at
a
considerable
distance
outside
the
palisades
of
the
station
to
its
inmates
under
the
very
guns
of
the
enemy
with
saddles
girt
and
reins
held
fast
our
rifles
well
in
front
at
last
tom
bell
and
i
were
mounted
the
gate
swung
wide
we
said
no
time
for
talk
had
bell
and
i
one
said
god
speed
another
fly
then
out
we
galloped
live
or
die
we
felt
each
moment
counted
the
trace
the
buffaloes
had
worn
stretched
broad
before
us
and
the
corn
and
cane
through
which
it
wended
we
knew
for
acres
from
the
gate
hid
indian
guile
and
tory
hate
we
rode
with
hearts
that
seemed
to
wait
for
instant
death
and
on
our
fate
the
station
fate
depended
no
rifle
cracked
no
creature
stirred
as
on
towards
lexington
we
spurred
unflinchingly
together
we
reached
the
woods
no
savage
shout
of
all
the
wild
wyandotte
rout
and
shawanese
had
yet
rung
out
but
now
and
then
an
indian
scout
showed
here
a
face
and
feather
we
rode
expecting
death
each
stride
from
thicket
depth
or
side
where
some
red
foe
might
huddle
for
well
we
knew
that
renegade
the
girty
had
not
stayed
his
fiends
from
us
who
rode
for
aid
the
dastard
he
who
had
betrayed
the
pioneers
of
ruddle
and
when
an
arrow
grazed
my
hair
i
did
not
turn
i
did
not
spare
to
spur
as
men
spur
warward
a
rang
this
side
a
rock
then
painted
faces
swarmed
to
block
our
way
with
brandished
tomahawk
and
rifle
then
a
shout
a
shock
and
we
again
rode
forward
they
followed
but
was
no
great
while
before
from
them
by
some
long
mile
of
forest
we
were
sundered
we
galloped
on
i
lost
my
gun
and
bell
whose
girth
had
come
undone
rode
saddleless
the
summer
sun
was
up
when
into
lexington
side
unto
side
we
thundered
too
late
for
todd
had
left
that
day
with
many
men
decoyed
away
to
hoy
by
some
false
story
and
we
must
after
bryan
needs
said
on
although
our
gallant
steeds
were
blown
enough
we
must
do
deeds
must
follow
where
our
duty
leads
be
it
to
death
or
glory
the
way
was
wild
and
often
barred
by
trees
and
rocks
and
it
was
hard
to
keep
our
hearts
from
sinking
but
thoughts
of
those
we
left
behind
gave
strength
to
muscle
and
to
mind
to
help
us
onward
through
the
blind
deep
woods
and
often
we
would
find
ourselves
of
loved
ones
thinking
the
hot
stockade
no
water
left
the
fierce
attack
all
hope
bereft
the
defender
the
and
the
groan
of
pain
all
day
the
slanting
of
fire
from
the
corn
and
cane
the
stern
defence
but
all
in
vain
and
then
at
last
surrender
but
not
for
bryan
no
too
well
must
they
remember
what
befell
at
ruddle
and
take
warning
so
thought
we
as
all
dust
and
sweat
we
rode
with
faces
forward
set
and
came
to
station
boone
while
yet
an
hour
from
noon
we
had
not
let
our
horses
rest
since
morning
here
ellis
met
us
with
his
men
they
did
not
stop
nor
tarry
then
that
little
band
of
lions
but
setting
out
at
once
with
aid
right
well
you
know
how
unafraid
they
charged
the
indian
ambuscade
and
through
a
storm
of
bullets
made
their
entrance
into
bryan
and
that
is
all
i
have
to
tell
no
more
the
huron
hideous
yell
sounds
to
assault
and
perhaps
to
us
some
praise
is
due
but
we
are
men
accustomed
to
such
dangers
which
we
often
woo
much
more
is
due
our
women
who
brought
to
the
station
water
on
the
jellico
spur
of
the
cumberlands
to
j
fox
you
remember
how
the
mist
when
we
climbed
to
devil
den
pearly
in
the
mountain
glen
and
above
us
amethyst
throbbed
or
circled
then
away
through
the
wildwoods
opposite
torn
and
scattered
vanished
into
dewy
gray
vague
as
in
romance
we
saw
from
the
fog
one
riven
trunk
with
branches
shrunk
thrust
a
monster
dragon
claw
and
we
climbed
for
hours
through
the
jellicoes
to
a
wooded
rock
that
shows
undulating
leagues
of
blue
summits
that
lie
dark
with
forests
bar
on
bar
ranging
their
irregular
purple
peaks
beneath
a
sky
soft
as
slumber
range
on
range
billow
their
enormous
spines
where
the
rocks
and
priestly
pines
sit
eternal
without
change
we
were
sons
of
nature
then
she
had
taken
us
to
her
signalized
by
brier
and
burr
something
more
to
her
than
men
pupils
of
her
lofty
moods
from
her
looks
wisdom
of
no
books
learned
we
in
those
solitudes
how
the
seed
supplied
the
flower
how
the
sapling
held
the
oak
how
within
the
vine
awoke
the
wild
impulse
still
to
tower
how
in
fantasy
or
mirth
springing
from
her
footsteps
there
curious
fungi
everywhere
bulged
exuded
from
the
earth
coral
vegetable
things
that
the
underworld
exhaled
bulbous
and
scaled
many
colored
and
in
rings
like
the
that
grew
pink
and
white
in
loamy
cracks
flowers
of
a
natural
wax
she
had
turned
her
fancy
on
that
laureled
precipice
where
the
chestnuts
dropped
their
burrs
sweet
with
balsam
of
the
firs
first
we
felt
her
mother
kiss
full
of
heaven
and
the
wind
while
the
forests
wood
on
wood
murmured
like
a
multitude
giving
praise
where
none
hath
freedom
met
us
there
we
saw
freedom
giving
audience
in
her
face
the
eloquence
of
love
and
law
round
her
with
majestic
hips
lay
the
giant
mountains
there
near
her
cataracts
tossed
their
hair
god
and
thunder
on
their
oft
an
eagle
or
a
hawk
or
a
scavenger
we
knew
winged
through
altitudes
of
blue
by
its
shadow
on
the
rock
or
a
cloud
of
templed
white
moved
a
lazy
berg
of
pearl
through
the
sky
pacific
swirl
shot
with
cool
cerulean
light
so
we
dreamed
an
hour
upon
that
warm
rock
the
lichens
mossed
while
around
us
foliage
tossed
coins
of
the
sun
then
arose
and
a
ravine
which
a
torrent
once
had
worn
made
our
roadway
to
the
corn
in
the
valley
deep
and
green
and
the
farm
house
with
its
bees
where
flowers
spun
gay
in
the
sun
hid
among
the
apple
trees
here
we
watched
the
twilight
fall
sunset
made
a
huge
rhododendron
rayed
round
the
sun
ball
then
through
scents
of
herb
and
soil
to
the
we
turned
in
the
twinkling
dusk
discerned
with
its
homes
of
toil
ah
those
nights
we
wandered
forth
on
some
haunted
mountain
path
when
the
moon
was
late
and
rathe
the
large
stars
sowed
south
and
north
splashed
with
gold
the
purple
skies
and
the
milky
zodiac
rolled
athwart
the
belted
black
seemed
a
path
to
paradise
and
we
walked
or
lingered
till
in
the
beneath
like
the
vapor
of
a
breath
breathed
in
frost
arose
the
still
architecture
of
the
mist
and
the
necromance
touched
the
mist
and
made
it
glance
like
a
town
of
amethyst
then
around
us
sharp
and
brusque
night
shrill
insects
strident
strung
instruments
that
buzzed
and
sung
pixy
music
of
the
dusk
and
we
seemed
to
hear
soft
sighs
and
hushed
steps
of
ghostly
things
fluttered
feet
or
rustled
wings
moved
before
us
gleaming
in
the
tangled
glade
seemed
the
eyes
of
warriors
stealing
under
watching
stars
to
some
midnight
ambuscade
to
the
indian
village
there
wigwamed
with
the
mist
that
slept
by
the
woodland
side
whence
crept
shadowy
shawnees
of
the
air
when
the
moon
rose
like
a
cup
lay
the
valley
brimmed
with
wine
of
mesmeric
shade
and
shine
to
the
moon
pale
face
held
up
as
she
rose
from
out
the
mines
of
the
eastern
darkness
night
met
her
clad
in
dewy
light
pine
mountain
sachem
pines
as
from
clouds
in
pearly
parts
her
serene
circumference
grew
home
we
turned
and
all
night
through
dreamed
the
dreams
of
happy
hearts
a
confession
these
are
the
facts
i
was
to
blame
i
brought
her
here
and
wrought
her
shame
she
came
with
me
all
trustingly
lovely
and
innocent
her
face
and
in
her
perfect
form
the
grace
of
purity
and
modesty
i
think
i
loved
her
then
dote
on
her
ambrosial
breast
and
throat
young
as
a
blossom
tenderness
her
eyes
that
were
both
glad
and
sad
her
cheeks
and
chin
that
dimples
had
her
mouth
to
kiss
and
kiss
three
months
passed
by
three
moons
of
fire
when
in
me
sickened
all
desire
and
in
its
place
a
devil
who
filled
all
my
soul
with
deep
disgust
and
on
the
victim
of
my
lust
turned
eyes
of
loathing
swiftly
grew
one
night
when
by
my
side
she
slept
i
rose
and
leaning
while
i
kept
the
dagger
hid
i
kissed
her
hair
and
throat
and
when
she
smiled
asleep
into
her
heart
i
drove
it
deep
and
left
her
dead
still
smiling
there
lilith
yea
there
are
some
who
always
seek
the
love
that
lasts
an
hour
and
some
who
in
love
language
speak
yet
never
know
his
power
of
such
was
i
who
knew
not
what
sweet
mysteries
may
rise
within
the
heart
when
is
its
lot
to
love
and
realize
of
such
was
i
ah
me
till
lo
your
face
on
mine
did
gleam
and
changed
that
world
i
used
to
know
into
an
evil
dream
that
world
wherein
on
hill
and
plain
great
poppies
bloomed
their
hot
hearts
thirsty
for
the
rain
and
sleepily
perfumed
above
below
on
every
part
a
crimson
shadow
lay
as
if
the
red
sun
streamed
athwart
and
sunset
was
alway
i
know
not
how
i
know
not
when
i
only
know
that
there
she
met
me
in
the
haunted
glen
a
poppy
in
her
hair
her
face
seemed
fair
as
mary
is
that
knows
no
sin
or
wrong
her
presence
filled
the
silences
as
music
fills
a
song
and
she
was
clad
like
the
mother
of
god
as
were
for
christ
sweet
sake
but
when
she
moved
and
where
she
trod
a
hiss
went
of
a
snake
though
seeming
sinless
till
i
die
i
shall
not
know
for
sure
why
to
my
soul
she
seemed
a
lie
and
otherwise
than
pure
nor
why
i
kissed
her
soon
and
late
and
for
her
felt
desire
while
loathing
of
her
passion
ate
into
my
soul
like
fire
was
it
because
my
soul
could
tell
that
like
the
she
had
no
soul
a
thing
of
hell
that
it
had
no
power
or
was
it
that
your
love
at
last
my
soul
so
long
had
craved
from
the
sweet
sin
that
held
me
fast
at
that
last
moment
saved
content
when
i
behold
how
some
pursue
fame
that
is
care
embodiment
or
fortune
whose
false
face
looks
true
a
humble
home
with
sweet
content
is
all
i
ask
for
me
and
you
a
humble
home
where
pigeons
coo
whose
path
leads
under
breezy
lines
of
cedars
to
a
gate
one
mass
of
is
all
i
ask
for
me
and
you
a
garden
which
all
summer
through
the
roses
old
make
redolent
and
gay
of
hue
and
tansy
with
its
homely
scent
is
all
i
ask
for
me
and
you
an
orchard
that
the
pippins
strew
from
whose
bruised
gold
the
juices
spring
a
vineyard
where
the
grapes
hang
blue
and
ripe
for
vintaging
is
all
i
ask
for
me
and
you
a
lane
that
leads
to
some
far
view
of
forest
and
of
bloomed
with
rose
and
each
with
a
bee
in
its
hot
hand
is
all
i
ask
for
me
and
you
at
morn
a
pathway
deep
with
dew
and
birds
to
vary
time
and
tune
at
eve
a
sunset
avenue
and
whippoorwills
that
haunt
the
moon
is
all
i
ask
for
me
and
you
dear
heart
with
wants
so
small
and
few
and
faith
that
better
far
than
gold
a
lowly
friend
a
child
or
two
to
care
for
us
when
we
are
old
is
all
i
ask
for
me
and
you
berrying
i
my
love
went
berrying
where
brooks
were
merrying
and
wild
wings
ferrying
heaven
amethyst
the
wildflowers
blessed
her
my
dearest
hester
the
winds
caressed
her
the
sunbeams
kissed
ii
i
followed
carrying
her
basket
varying
fond
hopes
of
marrying
with
hopes
denied
both
late
and
early
she
deemed
me
surly
and
bowed
her
curly
fair
head
and
sighed
iii
the
skies
look
lowery
it
will
he
showery
no
longer
flowery
the
way
i
find
no
use
in
going
will
soon
be
snowing
if
you
keep
growing
much
more
unkind
iv
then
looked
up
tearfully
and
i
all
fearfully
replied
my
dear
fully
will
i
explain
i
love
you
dearly
but
look
not
cheerly
since
all
says
clearly
i
love
in
vain
then
smiled
she
airily
and
answered
merrily
with
words
that
verily
made
me
decide
and
drawing
her
i
there
implored
her
i
who
adored
her
to
be
my
bride
vi
o
sweet
simplicity
of
young
rusticity
without
duplicity
whom
love
made
know
that
hearts
in
meter
make
earth
completer
and
kisses
sweeter
than
berries
grow
to
a
found
solitary
among
the
hills
o
with
early
april
wet
how
frail
and
pure
you
look
lost
in
this
nook
of
hills
down
which
the
hurrying
rills
fling
scrolls
of
melodies
which
the
birds
and
bees
weave
gossamers
of
song
invisible
but
strong
sweet
music
webs
they
spin
to
snare
the
spirit
in
ii
o
unto
your
face
i
set
my
lips
and
do
you
speak
or
is
it
but
some
freak
of
fancy
love
imparts
through
you
unto
the
desire
whispering
low
a
secret
none
may
know
but
such
as
sit
and
dream
by
and
stream
iii
o
o
darling
floweret
hued
like
the
timid
gem
that
stars
the
diadem
of
fay
or
sylvan
sprite
who
in
the
woods
all
night
is
busy
with
the
blooms
young
leaves
and
wild
perfumes
through
you
i
seem
t
have
seen
all
that
such
dreams
may
mean
iv
o
long
long
ago
we
met
was
in
a
two
children
in
a
vale
sat
underneath
glad
stars
far
from
the
world
of
wars
each
loved
the
other
well
her
eyes
were
like
the
spell
of
dusk
and
dawning
skies
the
purple
dark
that
dyes
the
midnight
his
were
blue
as
heaven
the
day
shines
through
o
what
is
this
vague
regret
this
yearning
so
like
tears
that
touches
through
the
years
long
past
when
myth
and
fable
in
all
strange
things
were
able
to
beautify
the
earth
things
of
immortal
worth
this
longing
that
to
me
is
like
a
memory
lived
long
ago
of
those
fair
children
who
it
knows
loved
with
no
mortal
love
whom
smiling
heaven
above
fostered
and
when
they
died
laid
side
by
loving
side
vi
o
i
dream
remembering
yet
a
tomb
out
of
whose
moss
a
bloom
sprang
with
three
petals
wan
as
are
the
eyes
of
dawn
and
two
as
darkly
deep
as
are
the
eyes
of
o
flower
that
seems
to
hold
some
memory
of
old
a
hope
a
happiness
at
which
i
can
but
guess
you
are
a
sign
to
me
of
immortality
through
you
my
spirit
sees
the
deathless
purposes
of
death
that
still
evolves
the
beauty
it
resolves
the
change
that
aye
fulfills
life

where
the
season
turns
the
land
to
gold
among

feet

known
of
old
when
we
were
children
who
would
laugh
and
run
glad
little
playmates
of
the
wind
and
sun
before
came

and

and
years
went
ill

on

awhile
my

has
gone
away
filled
with
strange
music
very
soft
and
low
a
dim
companion
touching
with
sweet
tone
the
discords
of
the
day
iii
you

when

kissed
your

and
said
farewell

fragrance
sweeter
than

bloom
accompanies
my
soul
and
fills
with
dreams
the
sad
and
sordid
streets
where
people
dwell
dreams
of

wild
perfume
wherefore
i
would
not
see
yet

behold
the
truth
they
preach
in

and
question
so
is
death
then
all

an
idle
tale

no

civilized
the

these
shall
be

beneath

more
loveliness

room
in
soul

or
o

rose
who
art
initial
and
sweet
period
of
my
heart
divinest
sentence
where
i
read
love
first
and
last
and
in
the
pauses
love
who
art
the
dear
ideal
of
each
deed
my
life
aspires
by
to
some
high
goal
set
in
the
haunted
garden
of
my
soul
the
artist
in
story
books
when
i
was
very
young
i
knew
you
first
one
of
the
fairy
race
and
then
it
was
your
picture
took
its
place
framed
in
with
love
deep
gold
and
draped
and
hung
high
in
my
heart
red
room
no
song
was
sung
no
tale
of
passion
told
i
did
not
grace
with
your
associated
form
and
face
and
intimated
charm
of
touch
and
tongue
as
years
went
on
you
grew
to
more
and
more
until
each
thing
symbolic
to
my
heart
of
beauty
such
as
honor
truth
and
fame
within
the
studio
of
my
soul
thought
wore
your
lineaments
whom
i
with
all
my
art
strove
to
embody
and
to
give
a
name
poetry
and
philosophy
out
of
the
past
the
dim
leaves
spoke
to
me
the
thoughts
of
pindar
with
a
voice
so
sweet
hyblæan
bees
seemed
swarming
my
retreat
around
the
reedy
well
of
poesy
i
closed
the
book
then
knee
to
neighbor
knee
sat
with
the
soul
of
plato
to
repeat
doctrines
till
mine
seemed
some
socratic
seat
high
on
the
summit
of
philosophy
around
the
wave
of
one
religion
taught
her
first
rude
children
from
the
stars
that
burned
above
the
mountained
other
science
learned
the
first
vague
lessons
of
the
work
she
wrought
daughters
of
god
in
whom
we
still
behold
the
age
of
iron
and
the
age
of
gold
quo
vadis
it
is
as
if
imperial
trumpets
broke
again
the
silence
on
war
iron
height
and
cæsar
armored
legions
marched
to
fight
while
rome
upon
her
blazed
like
an
awful
sunset
at
a
stroke
again
i
see
the
living
torches
light
the
horrible
revels
and
the
bloated
white
bayed
brow
of
nero
smiling
through
the
smoke
and
here
and
there
a
little
band
of
slaves
among
dark
ruins
and
the
form
of
paul
bearded
and
gaunt
expounding
still
the
word
and
towards
the
north
the
tottering
architraves
of
empire
and
over
all
the
flaming
figure
of
a
gothic
sword
to
a
critic
song
hath
a
catalogue
of
lovely
things
thy
kind
hath
oft
defiled
whose
spite
misleads
the
world
too
often
where
the
poet
reads
as
in
a
fable
of
old
envyings
crows
such
as
thou
which
hush
the
bird
that
sings
or
kill
it
with
their
cawings
thorns
and
weeds
such
as
thyself
which
the
wind
sows
seeds
of
these
crush
before
one
blossom
swings
but
here
and
there
the
wisdom
of
a
school
unknown
to
these
hath
often
written
down
fame
in
white
ink
the
future
hath
turned
brown
when
every
beauty
heaped
with
ridicule
in
their
ignoble
prose
proved
their
renown
making
each
famous
as
an
ass
or
fool
old
enthusiasms
are
dead
quite
dead
in
me
dead
the
aspiring
spasms
of
art
and
poesy
that
opened
magic
chasms
once
of
wild
mystery
in
youth
rich
araby
that
opened
magic
longing
and
the
care
are
mine
and
helplessly
the
heartache
and
despair
for
what
can
never
be
more
than
my
mortal
share
of
sad
mortality
it
seems
god
gives
to
me
more
than
my
mortal
world
o
time
o
fate
remorseless
trinity
let
not
your
wheel
abate
its
iron
rotary
turn
round
nor
make
me
wait
bound
to
it
neck
and
knee
hope
final
agony
turn
round
nor
make
