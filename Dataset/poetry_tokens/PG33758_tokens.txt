mangy
cur
reasty

as
if
you
a
grudge
her
all
fester
and
soil
corruption
and
boil
your
evil
face
like
some
carved
gargoyle
and
you
refused
to
stir
though
i
broke
th
lash
on
your
back
you
subjugated
me
you
proved
the
master
i
proved
the
hack
for
plainly
i
could
see
you
been
sent
back
to
earth
to
work
out
sin
and
y
came
straight
t
me
a
larrikin
an
why
did
you
come
to
me
what
were
you
there
unregenerate
thief
a
derelict
from
your
birth
were
you
a
pharisee
that
belial
of
this
earth
was
your
lecherous
lutish
animal
mind
drawn
to
me
as
one
of
your
kind
your

betrays
your
mirth
well
me
an
you
stand
chums
we
wo
each
other
despise
the
camp
may
call
us
a
couple
o
bums
but
we
hold
our
own
assize
we
stand
for
arbitration
straight
an
mebbe
some
day
at
peter
gate
we
look
in
each
other
eyes
ah
you
leprous
devil
you
taught
me
how
to
fumigate
my
soul
from
wanton
ways
and
dicing
days
and
lush
of
the
flowing
bowl
i
steeped
in
guilt
right
up
to
the
hilt
worshipped
in

of
shame
i
built
and
pleasure
been
my
goal
but
here
with
you
in
th
where
there
nothing
pure
but
snow
some
words
long
dumb
t
my
lips
have
come
a
prayer
that
i
used
to
know
our
father
i
wonder
will
he
refute
a
fellow
that
learns
of
a
malamute
t
take
th
kick
an
blow
oh
down
here
below
we
may

quite
a
place
runnin
other
towns
a
race
but
ther
ai
th
fun
we
had
them
good
old
days
the
trail
it
measures
the
boundless
distance
led
by
wild
ways
that
run
hither
and
thither
in
chase
of
the
winds
that
worship
the
northern
sun
the
trail
which
never
ending
was
never
yet
begun
in
the
dip
of
the
far
horizon
trembles
the
morning
star
to
the
heights
of
the
fathomless
ether
nor
lock
nor
bolt
nor
bar
the
trail
god
finger
beckoning
to
the
new
home
afar
no
sound
in
that
void
of
silence
save
call
of
bird
to
its
mate
or
cry
of
the
lone
coyote
at
the
bars
of
hunger
gate
and
the
heart
is
drawn
by
the
dawn
or
some
mysterious
fate
the
trail
hath
a
storied
splendor
tepee
and
indian
mound
where
the
glory
of
god
is
chanted
by
no
sacrilegious
sound
where
the
dumb
brute
bays
his
praise
through
nights
profound
here
the
haunts
of
men
are
bounden
by
the
links
of
custom
chain
there
you
find
embosomed
freedom
in
the
heart
exquisite
pain
and
thereafter
will
be
heard
the
cry
o
give
me
the
wilds
again
the
trail
hath
no
languorous
longing
it
leads
to
no
lotus
land
on
its
way
dead
hopes
come
thronging
to
take
you
by
the
hand
he
who
treads
the
trail
undaunted
thereafter
shall
command
the
king
of
the
klondike

are
burning
piercing
me
through
and
through
yet
another
comes
and
takes
her
place
i
close
my
eyes

wipe
away
the
beads
of
sweat
that
lie
on
my
brow
like
rain
and
i
try
to
pray
but
words
are
vain
for
i
know
that
the
ghosts
of
my
sins
are
here
to
mock
me

a

a
call
from
the
happy
where
human
hearts
beat
warm
where
western
beckon
and
shelter
from
life
storm
london
thy
heart
of
riches
hath
the
of
unrest
where
the
many
know
no
shelter
where
the
babe
weeps
at
the
breast
all
bared
to
the
winter
shiver
where
the
cold
and
dead
is
darkened
by
the
shadow
and
shapes
of
the
underfed
oh
the
hopeless
bearers
of
woe
and
pain
mere
human
stones
in
the
highway
of
london
greed
and
gain
there
weeps
the
child
whom
sadness
and
want
have
made
their
own
there
weeps
the
old
whom
gladness
is
a
stranger
and
unknown
oh
come
to
the
land
of
plenty
where
the
gates
swing
open
wide
where
all
mankind
stand
equal
where
toil
is
a
boast
a
pride
where
the
silken
palm
clasps
the
horny
hand
when
the
long
day
work
is
done
where
new
life
is
born
in
the
growing

with
the
air
of
a
queen
she
stepped
up
to
the
desk
asking
pray
have
you
seen
marmaduke
adding
proudly
the
gentleman

speaks
up
while

other
war
he
a
pardner
of
billy

know
as
jim
if
he
had
ther
a
war
out
him
i
describe
him
good
sirs
said
the
lady
in
tears
he
left
home
just
of
age
namely
his
hair
sunny
gold
is
inclined
to
his
complexion
is
he
fair
as
a
girl
he
has
large
soulful
eyes
they
are
beaming
and
kind
a
soft
voice
and
an
artistic
mind
military
in
bearing
and
tall
speaks
languages
seven
a
you
call
paints
sings
rides
to
hounds
he
dresses
with
care
a
manner
with
most
restful
air
oh
prithee
good
gentlemen
find
me
my
son
whom
all
london
once
knew
as
dashing
the
lady
was
weeping
in
of
lace
and
she
saw
not
the
smile
on
the
rough
miner
face
who
said
y
wo
find
angel
up
here
them
pertickler
brands
with
disappear
but
here
comin
he
knows
th
ol
tramp
every
jack
on
th
trail
every
jill
in
th
camp
the
door
opens
and
windy
appears
a
a
tough
to
his
ears
his
jeans
all
in
tatters
his
worn
his
parka
was
dirty
and
and
torn
his
greeting
wow
hand
out
a
hootch
durn
my
gizzard
if
i
war
cotched
in
a
hunker
crick
blizzard
the
lady
turns
pale
then
the
behind
hollers
windy
ol
cock
can
you
call
t
mind
a
chump
this
camp
wot
was
th
same
y
called
b
th
telescope
name
but
the
lady
eyes
staring
was
shrieking
my
son
lo
windy
was
dashing
my
song
i
could
not
sing
unless
my
song
had
in
its
symphony
one
broken
string
i
could
not
say
the
thoughts
that
in
me
rise
unless
my
heart
had
been
a
broken
thing
why
is
it
that
the
voice
of
song
so
yields
mute
music
till
the
heart
hath
bled
why
should
we
find
most
fair
and
fields
by
thorny
led
but
if
this
little
weakling
song
of
mine
might
carry
cheer
to
one
lone
grieving
soul
most
gladly
would
i
offer
hope
bright
wine
and
smiling
drink
the
lees
left
in
the
bowl
for
i
have
in
the
darkness
found
some
light
some
sunshine
seen
in
shadowed
evening
hours
and
i
have
found
throughout
the
lonely
night
some
perfumed
breathings
from
wild
garden
bowers
and
i
were
ingrate
not
to
send
it
on
such
echo
of
what
music
in
me
lies
for
it
may
bring
to
some
darkened
dawn
the
brightening
glow
that
comes
with
morning
skies
so
go
you
little
broken
song
and
carry
to
some
heart
in
bitter
pain
only
my
lute
light
laughter
make
thou
strong
the
weak
of
heart
and
bid
them
smile
again
