she
is
not
fair
to
outward
view
she
somewhere
in
the
sunlight
strong
she
was
not
as
pretty
as
women
i
know
stone
walls
do
not
a
prison
make
sweet
are
the
thoughts
that
savour
of
content
tell
me
not
sweet
i
am
unkind
the
air
which
thy
smooth
voice
doth
break
the
bee
to
the
heather
the
clouds
which
rise
with
thunder
slake
the
lark
above
our
heads
doth
know
the
lark

cruel
fate
should
bid
us
part
thou
hast
beauty
bright
and
fair
thrice
toss
these
oaken
ashes
in
the
air

not
your
beauty
can
engage
traverse
not
the
globe
for
lore
trust
thou
thy
love
if
she
be
proud
is
she
not
sweet

yonder
single

were
the

clouds
not
made
what
care

tho
beauty
fading
what
shall
i
send
my
love
today
when
delia
on
the
plain
appears
when
love
with
unconfined
wings
when
you
are
old
and
gray
and
full
of
sleep
why
should
not
the
wattle
do
why
so
pale
and
wan
fond
lover
woman
faith
and
woman
trust
you
say
i
love
not
i
do
not
play
a
little
book
of
old
time
verse
love
wantonness
love
guides
the
roses
of
thy
lips
and
flies
about
them
like
a
bee
if
i
approach
he
forward
skips
and
if
i
kiss
he
stingeth
me
love
in
thine
eyes
doth
build
his
bower
and
sleeps
within
their
pretty
shrine
and
if
i
look
the
boy
will
lower
and
from
their
orbs
shoot
shafts
divine
song
send
home
my
eyes
to
me
which
o
too
long
have
dwelt
on
thee
but
if
from
you
they
learnt
such
ill
to
sweetly
smile
and
then
beguile
keep
the
deceivers
keep
them
still
send
home
my
harmless
heart
again
which
no
unworthy
thought
could
stain
but
if
it
has
been
taught
by
thine
to
forfeit
both
its
word
and
oath
keep
it
for
then
is
none
of
mine
donne
fie
on
love
now
fie
on
foolish
love
it
not
befits
or
man
or
woman
know
it
love
was
not
meant
for
people
in
their
wits
and
they
that
fondly
show
it
betray
the
straw
and
features
in
their
brain
and
shall
have
bedlam
for
their
pain
if
simple
love
be
such
a
curse
to
marry
is
to
make
it
ten
times
worse
a
fragment
he
that
loves
a
rosy
cheek
or
a
coral
lip
admires
or
from
eyes
doth
seek
fuel
to
maintain
his
fires
as
old
time
makes
these
decay
so
his
flames
must
waste
away
but
a
smooth
and
steadfast
mind
gentle
thoughts
and
calm
desires
hearts
with
equal
love
combined
kindle
fires
where
these
are
not
i
despise
lovely
cheeks
or
lips
or
eyes
truce
in
love
entreated
no
more
blind
god
for
see
my
heart
is
made
thy
quiver
there
remains
no
void
place
for
another
dart
and
alas
that
conquest
gains
small
praise
that
only
brings
away
a
tame
and
unresisting
prey
behold
a
nobler
foe
all
arm
defies
thy
weak
artillery
that
hath
thy
bow
and
quiver
charm
a
rebel
beauty
conquering
thee
if
thou
equal

for
her

my
true

my

by

for

his
dear
and
mine
he
can
not

for
once
it
was

i
cherish
his
because
in
me
it
bides
my
true
love
hath
my
heart
and
i
have
his
phillip
to
electra
i
dare
not
ask
a
kiss
i
dare
not
beg
a
smile
lest
having
that
or
this
i
might
grow
proud
the
while
no
no
the
utmost
share
of
my
desire
shall
be
only
to
kiss
that
air
that
lately
kissed
thee
to
phyllis
the
fair
shepherdess
my
phyllis
hath
the
morning
sun
at
first
to
look
upon
her
and
phyllis
hath
birds
her
rising
still
to
honour
my
phyllis
hath
prime
feathered
flowers
that
smile
when
she
treads
on
them
and
phyllis
hath
a
gallant
flock
that
leaps
since
she
doth
own
them
but
phyllis
hath
too
hard
a
heart
alas
that
she
should
have
it
it
yields
no
mercy
to
desert
nor
peace
to
those
that
crave
it
sweet
sun
when
thou
on
pray
her
regard
my
moan
sweet
birds
when
you
sing
to
her
to
yield
some
pity
woo
her
sweet
flowers
that
she
treads
on
tell
her
her
beauty
dreads
one
and
if
in
life
her
love
she
not
agree
me
pray
her
before
i
die
she
will
come
see
me
edward
the
passionate
shepherd
to
his
love
come
live
with
me
and
be
my
love
and
we
will
all
the
pleasures
prove
that
valleys
groves
and
hills
and
fields
woods
or
steepy
mountain
yields
and
we
will
sit
upon
the
rocks
seeing
the
shepherds
feed
their
flocks
by
shallow
rivers
to
whose
falls
melodious
birds
sing
madrigals
and
i
will
make
thee
beds
of
roses
and
a
thousand
fragrant
posies
a
cap
of
flowers
and
a
kirtle
embroider
all
with
leaves
of
myrtle
a
gown
made
of
the
finest
wool
which
from
our
pretty
lambs
we
pull
fair
lined
slippers
for
the
cold
with
buckles
of
the
purest
gold
a
belt
of
straw
and
ivy
buds
with
coral
clasps
and
amber
studs
and
if
these
pleasures
may
thee
move
come
live
with
me
and
be
my
love
the
shepherd
swains
shall
dance
and
sing
for
thy
delight
each
may
morning
if
these
delights
thy
mind
may
move
come
live
with
me
and
be
my
love
content
sweet
are
the
thoughts
that
savour
of
content
the
quiet
mind
is
richer
than
a
crown
sweet
are
the
nights
in
careless
slumber
spent
the
poor
estate
scorns
fortune
angry
frown
such
sweet
content
such
minds
such
sleep
such
bliss
beggars
enjoy
when
princess
oft
do
miss
the
homely
house
that
harbours
quiet
rest
the
cottage
that
affords
no
pride
nor
care
the
mean
that
with
country
music
best
the
sweet
consort
of
mirth
and
modest
fare
obscured
life
sets
down
a
type
of
bliss
a
mind
content
both
crown
and
kingdom
is
my
jean
though
cruel
fate
should
bid
us
part
far
as
the
pole
and
line
her
dear
idea
round
my
heart
should
tenderly
entwine
though
mountains
rise
and
deserts
howl
and
oceans
roar
between
yet
dearer
than
my
deathless
soul
i
still
would
love
my
jean
sweet
love
i
will
no
more
abuse
thee
nor
with
my
voice
accuse
thee
but
tune
my
notes
unto
thy
praise
and
tell
the
world
love
decays
sweet
love
doth
concord
ever
cherish
what
wanteth
concord
soon
must
perish
to
celia
drink
to
me
only
with
thine
eyes
and
i
will
pledge
with
mine
or
leave
a
kiss
but
in
the
cup
and
i
not
look
for
wine
the
thirst
that
from
the
soul
doth
rise
doth
ask
a
drink
divine
but
might
i
of
jove
nectar
sup
i
would
not
change
for
thine
i
sent
thee
late
a
rosy
wreath
not
so
much
honouring
thee
as
giving
it
a
hope
that
there
it
could
not
withered
be
but
thou
thereon
didst
only
breathe
and
it
back
to
me
since
when
it
grows
and
smells
i
swear
not
of
itself
but
thee
love
not
me
for
comely
grace
for
my
pleasing
eye
or
face
nor
for
any
outward
part
no
nor
for
a
constant
heart
for
these
may
fail
or
turn
to
ill
so
thou
and
i
shall
sever
keep
therefore
a
true
woman
eye
and
love
me
still
but
know
not
why
so
hast
thou
the
same
reason
still
to
dote
upon
me
ever
to
his
mistress
choose
me
your
valentine
next
let
us
marry
love
to
the
death
will
pine
if
we
long
tarry
promise
and
keep
your
vows
or
vow
ye
never
love
doctrine
disallows
ever
you
have
broke
promise
twice
dear
to

love
come
he
will
enter
and
soon
find
out
his
way
you
may
esteem
him
a
child
for
his
might
or
you
may
deem
him
a
coward
for
his
flight
but
if
she
whom
love
doth
honour
be
concealed
from
the
day
set
a
thousand
guards
upon
her
love
will
find
out
the
way
some
think
to
lose
him
by
having
him
confin
and
some
do
suppose
him
poor
thing
to
be
blind
but
if
so
close
you
wall
him
do
the
best
that
you
may
blind
love
if
so
ye
call
him
will
find
out
his
way
you
may
train
the
eagle
to
stoop
to
your
fist
or
you
may
inveigle
the
phoenix
of
the
east
the
lioness
you
may
move
her
to
give
her
prey
but
you
will
stop
a
lover
he
will
find
out
his
way
to
daffodils
fair
daffodils
we
weep
to
see
you
haste
away
so
soon
as
yet
the
sun
has
not
attained
his
noon
stay
stay
until
the
lasting
day
has
run
but
to
the
evensong
and
having
prayed
together
we
will
go
with
you
along
phillida
flouts
me
oh
what
a
plague
is
love
i
can
not
bear
it
she
will
inconstant
prove
i
greatly
fear
it
it
so
torments
my
mind
that
my
heart
faileth
she
wavers
with
the
wind
as
a
ship
saileth
please
her
the
best
i
may
she
looks
another
way
alack
and
well
phillida
flouts
me
i
often
heard
her
say
that
she
loved
posies
in
the
last
month
of
may
i
gave
her
roses
cowslips
and
gilly
and
the
sweet
lily
i
got
to
deck
the
of
my
dear
philly
she
did
them
all
disdain
and
threw
them
back
again
therefore
is
flat
and
plain
phillida
flouts
me
which
way
i
go
she
still
torments
me
and
i
do
nothing
contents
me
i
fade
and
pine
away
with
grief
and
sorrow
i
fall
quite
to
decay
like
any
shadow
since
no
better
be
i
bear
it
patiently
yet
all
the
world
may
see
phillida
flouts
me
song
to
flavia
is
not
your
beauty
can
engage
my
wary
heart
the
sun
in
all
his
pride
and
rage
has
not
that
art
and
yet
he
shines
as
bright
as
you
if
brightness
could
our
souls
subdue
is
not
the
pretty
things
you
say
nor
those
you
write
which
can
make
thyrsis
heart
your
prey
for
that
delight
the
graces
of
a
mind
in
some
of
our
own

we
find
no
flavia
is
your
love
i

surest
darts
those
which
so
seldom
fail

the

my
love
there
is
no
once
did
my
thoughts
both
ebb
and
flow
as
passion
did
them
move
once
did
i
hope
straight
fear
again
and
then
i
was
in
love
once
did
i
waking
spend
the
night
and
tell
how
many
minutes
move
once
did
i
wishing
waste
the
day
and
then
i
was
in
love
once
by
my
carving
true
love
knot
the
weeping
trees
did
prove
that
wounds
and
tears
were
both
our
lot
and
then
i
was
in
love
once
did
i
breathe
another
breath
and
in
my
mistress
move
once
was
i
not
mine
own
at
all
and
then
i
was
in
love
once
wore
i
bracelets
made
of
hair
and
collars
did
approve
once
wore
my
clothes
made
out
of
wax
and
then
i
was
in
love
once
did
i
sonnet
to
my
saint
my
soul
in
numbers
move
once
did
i
tell
a
thousand
lies
and
then
i
was
in
love
once
in
my
ear
did
dangling
hang
a
little
once
in
a
word
i
was
a
fool
and
then
i
was
in
love
to
the
virgins
to
make
much
of
time
gather
ye
rosebuds
while
ye
may
old
time
is
still
and
this
same
flower
that
smiles
today
tomorrow
will
be
dying
the
glorious
lamp
of
heaven
the
sun
the
higher
he
the
sooner
will
his
race
be
run
and
nearer
he
to
setting
that
age
is
best
which
is
the
first
when
youth
and
blood
are
warmer
but
being
spent
the
worse
and
worst
times
still
succeed
the
former
then
be
not
coy
but
use
your
time
and
while
ye
may
go
marry
for
having
lost
but
once
your
prime
you
may
forever
tarry
my
kate
she
was
not
as
pretty
as
women
i
know
and
yet
all
your
best
made
of
sunshine
and
snow
drop
to
shade
melt
to
naught
in
the
ways
while
she
still
remember
on
warm
and
cold
days
my
kate
her
air
had
a
meaning
her
movements
a
grace
you
turn
from
the
fairest
to
gaze
on
her
face
and
when
you
had
once
seen
her
forehead
and
mouth
you
saw
as
distinctly
her
soul
and
her
truth
my
kate
such
a
blue
inner
light
from
her
eyelids
outbroke
you
look
at
her
silence
and
fancied
she
spoke
when
she
did
so
peculiar
yet
soft
was
the
tone
tho
the
loudest
spoke
also
you
heard
her
alone
my
kate
i
doubt
if
she
said
to
you
much
that
could
act
as
a
thought
or
suggestion
she
did
not
attract
in
the
sense
of
the
brilliant
or
wise
i
infer
twas
her
thinking
of
others
made
you
think
of
her
my
kate
she
never
found
fault
with
you
never
implied
your
wrong
by
her
right
and
yet
men
at
her
side
grew
nobler
girls
purer
as
thro
the
whole
town
the
children
were
gladder
that
pull
at
her
gown
my
kate
none
knelt
at
her
feet
confess
lovers
in
thrall
they
knelt
more
to
god
than
they
used
that
was
all
if
you
praised
her
as
charming
some
ask
what
you
meant
but
the
charm
of
her
presence
was
felt
when
she
went
my
kate
the
weak
and
the
gentle
the
ribald
and
rude
she
took
as
she
found
them
and
did
them
all
good
it
always
was
so
with
her
see
what
you
have
she
has
made
the
grass
greener
even
here
with
her
grave
my
kate
my
dear
one
when
thou
wast
alive
with
the
rest
i
held
thee
the
sweetest
and
loved
thee
the
best
and
now
thou
art
dead
shall
i
not
take
thy
part
as
thy
smiles
used
to
do
for
thyself
my
sweet
heart

kate

there
is
no
friend
like
an
old
friend
who
has
shared
our
morning
days
no
greeting
like
his
welcome
no
homage
like
his
praise
fame
is
the
scentless
sunflower
with
gaudy
crown
of
gold
but
friendship
is
the
breathing
rose
with
sweets
in
every
fold

grief
i
tell
you
hopeless
grief

passionless
that
only
men
incredulous
of
despair
half
taught
in
anguish
through
the
midnight
air
beat
upward
to
god
throne
in
loud
excess
of
shrieking
and
reproach
full
desertness
in
soul
as

lieth
under
the
blanching
vertical
of
the
absolute

man
express
grief
for
thy
dead
in
silence
like
to
death
most
like
a
monumental
statue
set
in
everlasting
watch
and
moveless
woe
till
itself
crumble

from

dank
drops
from

green
boughs
of

thrush
tunes
his
song
warbling
with
unripe

thro

oak
i

thee
and

thy

unfold
the
primrose
pale
and
violet
while
in
the
central
grove
at
thy
soft
voice
the
dryads
start
forth
from
their
wintry
cells
and
from
their
oozy
waves
the
naiads
lift
their
heads
in
sedgy
bonnets
trimm
with
rushy
leaves
and
from

to
pay
their

to
thee
their
thrice
adored

thro

thou

is

if
thus
our

you
sever

is
such
a
mystery
i
can
not
find
it
out
for
when
i

i
best
resolved
i
then
am
most
in
doubt
then
farewell
love
and
farewell

made
desolate

his

and
birth
was
shrunken
hard
and
dry
and
every

written
on
terrestrial

afar

around

i

think
there
trembled
through

whereof

thee
i
leave
thee

them

my

so
easy
my

that
freedom
is
tasteless
and
roving
a
pain
through
walks
grown
with
woodbines
as
often
we
stray
around
us
our
girls
and
boys
frolic
and
play
how
pleasing
their
sport
is
the
wanton
ones
see
and
borrow
their
looks
from
my
jessie
and
me
to
try
her
sweet
temper
sometimes
am
i
seen
in
revels
all
day
with
the
nymphs
of
the
green
though
painful
my
absence
my
doubts
she
beguiles
and
meets
me
at
night
with
compliance
and
smiles
what
though
on
her
cheek
the
rose
loses
its
hue
her
ease
and
good
humour
bloom
all
the
year
through
time
still
as
he
flies
brings
increase
to
her
truth
and
gives
to
her
mind
what
he
steals
from
her
youth
ye
shepherds
so
gay
who
make
love
to
ensnare
and
cheat
with
false
vows
the
too
credulous
fair
in
search
of
true
pleasure
how
vainly
you
roam
to
hold
it
for
life
you
must
find
it
at
home
on
a
fan
that
belonged
to
the

this
was
the

how

ah
but
things
more
than
polite
hung
on
this
toy
voyez

matters
of
state
and
of
might
things
that
great
ministers
do
things
that
maybe
overthrew
those
in
whose
brains
they
began
here
was
the
sign
and
the
cue
this
was
the
pompadour
fan
where
are
the
secrets
it
knew
weavings
of
plot
and
of

but
where
is
the
pompadour

this

a
birthday
my

is
like
a

bird
whose

whose
boughs
are
bent
with
fruit
my
heart
is
like
a
rainbow
shell
that
paddles
in
a
halcyon
sea
my
heart
is
gladder
than
all
these
because
my

is
come
to
me
raise
me
a
dais
of
silk
and
down
hang
it
with
vair
and
purple
dyes
carve
it
in
doves
and
pomegranates
and
peacocks
with
a
hundred
eyes
work
it
in
gold
and
silver
grapes
in
leaves
and
silver
because
the
birthday
of
my
life
is

thy

love
in
thy

make
thee
colder

though
each

new
arise
yet
we
each
day
grow
older
thou
as
heaven
art
fair
and
young
thine
eyes
like
twin
stars
shining
but
ere
another
day
be
sprung
all
these
will
be
declining
then
winter
comes
with
all
his
fears
and
all
thy
sweets
shall
borrow
too
late
then
wilt
thou
shower
thy
tears
and
i
too
late
shall
sorrow
days
daughters
of
time
the
hypocritic
days
muffled
and
dumb
like
barefoot
dervishes
and
marching
single
in
an
endless
file
bring
diadems
and
faggots
in
their
hands
to
each
they
offer
gifts
after
his
will
bread
kingdoms
stars
and
sky
that
holds
them
all
i
in
my
pleached
garden
watch
the
pomp
forgot
my
morning
wishes
hastily
took
a
few
herbs
and
apples
and
the
day
turn
and
departed
silent
i
too
late
under
her
solemn
fillet
saw
the
scorn
waldo
a
hymn
to
love
i
will
confess
with
cheerfulness
love
is
a
thing
so
likes
me
that
let
her
lay
on
me
all
day
i
kiss
the
hand
that
strikes
me
i
will
not
i
now
cry
it
ah
too
late
repents
me
that
i
did
fall
to
love
at
all
since
love

lie
still

the

is
weaving
her

chain
the
deep
whose

is
gently
heaving

asleep

the

bows
before
thee
to
listen
and
adore
thee
with

of

shall
i

attune

that
i
can
love
as
well
as
they
i
send
a

for
that
would
be

borne

neither

me
too
because
i

devise
some
sport
to
please
those

in
your

must
here
confess
it
the
most
i
love
when
i
the

express
it
small
griefs

full
casks
are
ever
found
to
give

any
yet
but
little
sound
deep
waters
noiseless
are
and
this
we
know
that
chiding
streams
betray
small
depths
below
so
when
love
speechless
is
she
doth
express
a
depth
in
love
and
that
depth
bottomless
now
since
my
love
is
tongueless

me
such
who
speak

slowly
read
and
dream
of
the
soft
look
your
eyes
had
once
and
of
their
shadows
deep
how
many
loved
your
moments
of
glad
grace
and
loved
your
beauty
with
love
false
or
true
but
one
man
loved
the
pilgrim
soul
in
you
and
loved
the
sorrows
of
your
changing
face
and
bending
down
beside
the
glowing
bars
murmur
a
little
sadly
how
love
fled
and
paced
upon
the
mountains
overhead
and
hid
his
face
amid
a
crowd
of
stars

false
though
she
be
to
me
and

i
pursue

for
still
the

i
approve
though
i
deplore
her
change
in
hours
of
bliss
we
oft
have
met
they
could
not
always
last
and
though
the
present
i
regret

for
the
past

i
lately
vow

was
in

that
i
no
more
would
court
the
joys
that
seem

they
are

as
dull
as
they
are

oft
to
hate

my

melted
through
its
graceful
bower
leaf
after
leaf

bright

unfolding

of
thy
locks
thy
step
is
as
the

that
weaves
its
playful
way
among
the
leaves
thine

are
springs
in
whose
serene
and
silent

are
the
herds
that
look
on
their
young
figures
in

not
more
sinless
than
thy

solitudes

there
cullen
all

the
clouds
which
rise
with

with

the
blow
most
dreaded
falls
to
break
from
off
our

a
chain
and
wrongs
of

make
the
love
of

more
plain
as
through
the
shadowy
lens
of

with

each

wade
till
creeping
up
and
up
the
cold
green
water
quenches
every
limb
then
to
the
jealous
god
with
lifted
hand
i
pour
libation
from
a
rosy
cup
and
leap
and
dive
and
see
the
tunnies
swim
cracroft
on
a
nightingale
in
april
the
yellow
moon
is
a
dancing
phantom
down
secret
ways
of
the
flowing
shade
and
the
waveless
stream
has
a
murmuring
whisper
where
the
alders
wade
not
a
breath
not
a
sigh
save
the
slow
stream
whisper
only
the
moon
is
a
dancing
blade
that
leads
a
host
of
the
crescent
warriors
to
a
phantom
raid
out
of
the
lands
of
faerie
a
summons
a
long
strange
cry
that
thrills
thro
the
glade
the
glooms
of
the
elm
are
stirring
newly
afraid
last
heard
white
music
under
the
olives
where
once
theocritus
sang
and
play
thy
thracian
song
is
the
old
new
wonder
o
maid
from
abroad
o
to
be
in
england
now
that
april
there
and
whoever
wakes
in
england
sees
some
morning
unaware
that
the
lowest
boughs
and
the
brushwood
sheaf
round
the
bole
are
in
tiny
leaf
while
the
chaffinch
sings
on
the
orchard
bough
in
england
now
and
after
april
when
may
follows
and
the
whitethroat
builds
and
all
the
swallows
hark
where
my
blossom
in
the
hedge
leans
to
the
field
and
scatters
on
the
clover
blossoms
and
dewdrops
at
the
bent
spray
edge
that
the
wise
thrush
he
sings
each
song
twice
over
lest
you
should
think
he
never
could
recapture
the
first
fine
careless
rapture
and
though
the
fields
look
rough
with
hoary
dew
all
will
be
gay
when
noontide
wakes
anew
the
buttercups
the
little
children
dower
far
brighter
than
this
gaudy
few
happy
matches
say
mighty
love
and
teach
my
song
to
whom
thy
sweetest
joys
belong
and
who
the
happy
pairs
whose
yielding
hearts
and
joining
hands
find
blessings
twisted
with
their
bands
to
soften
all
their
cares
two
kindest
souls
alone
must
meet
is
friendship
makes
the
bondage
sweet
and
feeds
their
mutual
loves
bright
venus
on
her
rolling
throne

drawn
by
gentlest
birds
alone
and

isaac
a
song
gentle
love
this
hour
befriend
me
to
my
eyes
resign
thy
dart
notes
of
melting
music
lend
me
to
dissolve
a
frozen
heart
chill
as
mountain
snow
her
bosom
though
i
tender
language
use
is
by
cold
indifference
frozen
to
my
arms
and
to
my
muse
see
my
dying
eyes
are
pleading
where
a
breaking
heart
appears
for
thy
pity
interceding
with
the
eloquence
of
tears
while
the
lamp
of
life
is
fading
and
beneath
thy
coldness
dies
death
my
ebbing
pulse
invading
take
my
soul
into
thy
eyes
love
likeness
o
mark
yon
when
the
west
breathes
on
her
with
too
warm
a
zest
she
turns
her
cheek
away
yet
if
one
moment
he
refrain
she
turns
her
cheek
to
him
again
and
woos
him
still
to
stay
is
she
not
like
a
maiden
coy
press
by
some
boy
tho
coy
she
courts
him
too
winding
away
her
slender
form
she
will
not
have
him
woo
so
warm
and
yet
will
have
him
woo
my
lady
i
loved
her
for
that
she
was
beautiful
and
that
to
me
she
seem
to
be
all
nature
and
all
varieties
of
things
in
one
would
set
at
night
in
clouds
of
tears
and
rise
all
light
and
laughter
in
the
morning
fear
no
petty
customs
nor
appearances
but
think
what
others
only
dream
about
and
say
what
others
did
but
think
and
do
what
others
did
but
say
and
glory
in
what
others
dared
but
do
so
pure
withal
in
soul
in
heart
and
act
such
conscious
yet
such
perfect
innocence
she
made
round
her
a
halo
of
delight
was
these
which
won
me
and
that
she
never
school
within
her
breast
one
thought
or
feeling
but
gave
holiday
to
all
and
that
she
made
all
even
mine
in
the
communion
of
love
and
we
grew
like
each
other
for
we
loved
each
other
she
mild
and
generous
as
the
air
in
spring
and
i
like
earth
all
budding
out
with
love
james
to
a
discarded
toast
celia
confess
is
all
in
vain
to
patch
the
ruins
of
thy
face
nor
of
time
complain
that
robs
it
of
each
blooming
grace
if
love
no
more
shall
bend
his
bow
nor
point
his
arrows
from
thine
eye
if
no
lac
fop
nor
feathered
beau
despairing
at
thy
feet
shall
die
yet
still
my
charmer
wit
like
thine
shall
triumph
over
age
and
fate
thy
setting
beams
with
lustre
shine
and
rival
their
meridian
height
beauty
fair
flower
soon
fades
away
and
transient
are
the
joys
of
love
but
wit
and
virtue
decay
ador
below
and
bless
above
the
bonnie
wee
thing
bonnie
wee
thing
cannie
wee
thing
lovely
wee
thing
wast
thou
mine
i
wad
wear
thee
in
my
bosom
lest
my
jewel
i
should
tine
wishfully
i
look
and
languish
in
that
bonnie
face
o
thine
and
my
heart
it
stounds
wi
anguish
lest
my
wee
thing
be
na
mine
wit
and
grace
and
love
and
beauty
in
ae
constellation
shine
to
adore
thee
is
my
duty
goddess
o
this
sould
of
mine
song
from
the
princess
now
sleeps
the
crimson
petal
now
the
white
nor
waves
the
cypress
in
the
palace
walk
nor
winks
the
gold
fin
in
the
porphyry
font
the
firefly
wakens
waken
thou
with
me
now
droops
the
peacock
like
a
ghost
and
like
a
ghost
she
glimmers
on
to
me
now
lies
the
earth
all
danaë
to
the
stars
and
all
thy
heart
lies
open
unto
me
now
slides
the
silent
meteor
on
and
leaves
a
shining
furrow
as
thy
thoughts
in
me
now
folds
the
lily
all
her
sweetness
up
and
slips
into
the
bosom
of
the
lake
so
fold
thyself
my
dearest
thou
and
slip
into
my
bosom
and
be
lost
in
me
song
she
is
not
fair
to
outward
view
as
many
maidens
be
her
loveliness
i
never
knew
until
she
smiled
on
me
o
then
i
saw
her
eye
was
bright
a
well
of
love
a
spring
of
light
but
now
her
looks
are
coy
and
cold
to
mine
they
reply
and
yet
i
cease
not
to
behold
the
in
her
eye
her
very
frowns
are
fairer
far
than
smiles
of
other
maidens
are
to
a
lofty
beauty
from
her
poor
kinsman
fair
maid
had
i
not
heard
thy
baby
cries
nor
seen
thy
girlish
sweet
vicissitude
thy
mazy
motions
striving
to
elude
yet
wooing
still
a
parent
watchful
eyes
thy
humours
many
as
the
opal
dyes
and
lovely
all
methinks
thy
scornful
mood
and
bearing
high
of
stately
womanhood
thy
brow
where
beauty
sits
to
tyrannize
humble
love
had
made
me
sadly
fear
thee
for
never
sure
was
seen
a
royal
bride
whose
gentleness
gave
grace
to
so
much
pride
my
very
thoughts
would
tremble
to
be
near
thee
but
when
i
see
thee
at
thy
father
side
old
times
unqueen
thee
and
old
loves
endear
thee
time
of
roses
it
was
not
in
the
winter
our
loving
lot
was
cast
it
was
the
time
of
roses
we
pluck
them
as
we
pass
that
churlish
season
never
on
early
lovers
yet
o
no
the
world
was
newly
with
flowers
when
first
we
met
was
twilight
and
i
bade
you
go
but
still
you
held
me
fast
it
was
the
time
of
roses
we
pluck
them
as
we
pass
hermione
thou
hast
beauty
bright
and
fair
manner
noble
aspect
free
eyes
that
are
untouch
by
care
what
then
do
we
ask
from
thee
hermione
hermione
thou
hast
reason
quick
and
strong
wit
that
envious
men
admire
and
a
voice
itself
a
song
what
then
can
we
still
desire
hermione
hermione
something
thou
dost
want
o
queen
as
the
gold
doth
ask
alloy
tears
amidst
thy
laughter
seen
pity
mingling
with
thy
joy
this
is
all
we
ask
from
thee
hermione
hermione
waller
delia
fair
the
face
of
orient
day
fair
the
tints
of
rose
but
fairer
still
my
delia
dawns
more
lovely
far
her
beauty
blows
sweet
the
lark
lay
sweet
the
tinkling
rill
to
hear
but
delia
more
delightful
still
steal
thine
accents
on
mine
ear
the
busy
bee
the
rosy
banquet
loves
to
sip
sweet
the
streamlet
limpid
lapse
to
the
arab
lip
but
delia
on
thy
balmy
lips
let
me
no
vagrant
insect
rove
o
let
me
steal
one
liquid
kiss
for
oh
my
soul
is
parch
with
love
speaking
and
kissing
the
air
which
thy
smooth
voice
doth
break
into
my
soul
like
lightning
flies
my
life
retires
while
thou
dost
speak
and
thy
soft
breath
its
room
supplies
lost
in
this
pleasing
ecstasy
i
join
my
trembling
lips
to
thine
and
back
receive
that
life
from
thee
which
i
so
gladly
did
resign
forbear
platonic
fools
what
numbers
do
the
soul
compose
no
harmony
can
life
inspire
but
that
which
from
these
accents
flows
a
rondeau
to
ethel
in
times
the
style
of
dress
would
meet
your
beauty
i
confess
the
patch
you
wear
i
picture
you
the
powdered
hair
you
make
a
charming
shepherdess
and
i
no

could
well

the
parts

precisely
yes
we
should
achieve
a
huge
success
you
should
disdain

despair
with

the
