he
ate
his

as

he
took
was

he
took
was

but
they
all
were
small
to
the
cellar
he
took
when
he
set
out
to

and
noah
he
often
said
to
his
wife
when
he
sat
down
to
dine
i
do
care
where
the
water
goes
if
it
does
get
into
the
wine
the
cataract
of
the
cliff
of
heaven
fell
blinding
off
the
brink
as
if
it
would
wash
the
stars
away
as
suds
go
down
a
sink
the
seven
heavens
came
roaring
down
for
the
throats
of
hell
to
drink
and
noah
he
cocked
his
eye
and
said
it
looks
like
rain
i
think
the
water
has
drowned
the
matterhorn
as
deep
as
a
mendip
mine
but
i
do
care
where
the
water
goes
if
it
does
get
into
the
wine
but
noah
he
sinned
and
we
have
sinned
on
tipsy
feet
we
trod
till
a
great
big
black
teetotaller
was
sent
to
us
for
a
rod
and
you
ca
get
wine
at
a
or
chapel
or
eisteddfod
for
the
curse
of
water
has
come
again
because
of
the
wrath
of
god
and
water
is
on
the
bishop
board
and
the
higher
thinker
shrine
but
i
do
care
where
the

goes
if
it

the
song
against
grocers
god
made
the
wicked
grocer
for
a
mystery
and
a
sign
that
men
might
shun
the
awful
shops
and
go
to
inns
to
dine
where
the
bacon
on
the
rafter
and
the
wine
is
in
the
wood
and
god
that
made
good
laughter
has
seen
that
they
are
good
the
grocer
would
call
his
mother
and
bow
at
her
and
bob
at
her
her
aged
soul
to
damn
and
rub
his
horrid
hands
and
ask
what
article
was
next
though
in
should
be
her
proper
text
his
props
are
not
his
children
but
pert
lads
underpaid
who
call
out
cash
and
bang
about
to
work
his
wicked
trade
he
keeps
a
lady
in
a
cage
most
cruelly
all
day
and
makes
her
count
and
calls
her
miss
until
she
fades
away
the
righteous
minds
of
innkeepers
induce
them
now
and
then
to
crack
a
bottle
with
a
friend
or
treat
unmoneyed
men
but
who
hath
seen
the
grocer
treat
housemaids
to
his
teas
or
crack
a
bottle
of
or
stand
a
man
a
cheese
he
sells
us
sands
of
araby
as
sugar
for
cash
down
he
sweeps
his
shop
and
sells
the
dust
the
purest
salt
in
town
he
crams
with
cans
of
poisoned
meat
poor
subjects
of
the
king
and
when
they
die
by
thousands
why
he
laughs
like
anything
the
wicked
grocer
groces
in
spirits
and
in
wine
not
frankly
and
in
fellowship
as
men
in
inns
do
dine
but
packed
with
soap
and
sardines
and
carried
off
by
grooms
for
to
be
snatched
by
duchesses
and
drunk
in
the
grocer
has
a
temple
made
of
tin
and
the
ruin
of
good
innkeepers
is
loudly
urged
therein
but
now
the
sands
are
running
out
from
sugar
of
a
sort
the
grocer
trembles
for
his
time
just
like
his
weight
is
short
the
rolling
english
road
before
the
roman
came
to
rye
or
out
to
severn
strode
the
rolling
english
drunkard
made
the
rolling
english
road
a
reeling
road
a
rolling
road
that
rambles
round
the
shire
and
after
him
the
parson
ran
the
sexton
and
the
squire
a
merry
road
a
mazy
road
and
such
as
we
did
tread
the
night
we
went
to
birmingham
by
way
of
beachy
head
i
knew
no
harm
of
bonaparte
and
plenty
of
the
squire
and
for
to
fight
the
frenchman
i
did
not
much
desire
but
i
did
bash
their
baggonets
because
they
came
arrayed
to
straighten
out
the
crooked
road
an
english
drunkard
made
where
you
and
i
went
down
the
lane
with
in
our
hands
the
night
we
went
to
glastonbury
by
way
of
goodwin
sands
his
sins
they
were
forgiven
him
or
why
do
flowers
run
behind
him
and
the
hedges
all
strengthing
in
the
sun
the
wild
thing
went
from
left
to
right
and
knew
not
which
was
which
but
the
wild
rose
was
above
him
when
they
found
him
in
the
ditch
god
pardon
us
nor
harden
us
we
did
not
see
so
clear
the
night
we
went
to
bannockburn
by
way
of
brighton
pier
my
friends
we
will
not
go
again
or
ape
an
ancient
rage
or
stretch
the
folly
of
our
youth
to
be
the
shame
of
age
but
walk
with
clearer
eyes
and
ears
this
path
that
wandereth
and
see
undrugged
in
evening
light
the
decent
inn
of
death
for
there
is
good
news
yet
to
hear
and
fine
things
to
be
seen
before
we
go
to
paradise
by
way
of
kensal
green
the
song
of
quoodle
they
have
got
no
noses
the
fallen
sons
of
eve
even
the
smell
of
roses
is
not
what
they
supposes
but
more
than
mind
discloses
and
more
than
men
believe
they
have
got
no
noses
they
can
not
even
tell
when
door
and
darkness
closes
the
park
a
jew
encloses
where
even
the
law
of
moses
will
let
you
steal
a
smell
the
brilliant
smell
of
water
the
brave
smell
of
a
stone
the
smell
of
dew
and
thunder
the
old
bones
buried
under
are
things
in
which
they
blunder
and
err
if
left
alone
the
wind
from
winter
forests
the
scent
of
scentless
flowers
the
breath
of
brides
adorning
the
smell
of
snare
and
warning
the
smell
of
sunday
morning
god
gave
to
us
for
and
quoodle
here
discloses
all
things
that
quoodle
can
they
have
got
no
noses
they
have
got
no
noses
and
goodness
only
knowses
the
noselessness
of
man
pioneers
o
pioneers
nebuchadnezzar
the
king
of
the
jews
suffered
from
new
and
original
views
he
crawled
on
his
hands
and
knees
it
said
with
grass
in
his
mouth
and
a
crown
on
his
head
with
a
wowtyiddly
etc
those
in
traditional
paths
that
trod
thought
the
thing
was
a
curse
from
god
but
a
pioneer
men
always
abuse
like
nebuchadnezzar
the
king
of
the
jews
black
lord
foulon
the
frenchman
slew
thought
it
a
futurist
thing
to
do
he
offered
them
grass
instead
of
bread
so
they
stuffed
him
with
grass
when
they
cut
off
his
head
with
a
wowtyiddly
etc
for
the
pride
of
his
soul
he
perished
then
but
of
course
it
is
always
of
pride
that
men
a
man
in
advance
of
his
age
accuse
like
nebuchadnezzar
the
king
of
the
jews
simeon
scudder
of
styx
in
maine
thought
of
the
thing
and
was
at
it
again
he
gave
good
grass
and
water
in
pails
to
a
thousand
irishmen
hammering
rails
with
a
wowtyiddly
etc
appetites
differ
and
tied
to
a
stake
he
was
tarred
and
feathered
for
conscience
sake
but
stoning
the
prophets
is
ancient
news
like
nebuchadnezzar
the
king
of
the
jews
the
logical
vegetarian
why
should
i
have
a
purely
vegetarian
drink
why
should
i
take
vegetables
in
their
highest
form
so
to
speak
the
modest
vegetarians
ought
obviously
to
stick
to
wine
or
beer
plain
vegetarian
drinks
instead
of
filling
their
goblets
with
the
blood
of
bulls
and
elephants
as
all
conventional
do
i
dalroy
you
will
find
me
drinking
rum
like
a
sailor
in
a
slum
you
will
find
me
drinking
beer
like
a
bavarian
you
will
find
me
drinking
gin
in
the
lowest
kind
of
inn
because
i
am
a
rigid
vegetarian
so
i
cleared
the
inn
of
wine
and
i
tried
to
climb
the
sign
and
i
tried
to
hail
the
constable
as
marion
but
he
said
i
could
speak
and
he
bowled
me
to
the
beak
because
i
was
a
happy
vegetarian
oh
i
knew
a
doctor
gluck
and
his
nose
it
had
a
hook
and
his
attitudes
were
anything
but
aryan
so
i
gave
him
all
the
pork
that
i
had
upon
a
fork
because
i
am
myself
a
vegetarian
i
am
silent
in
the
club
i
am
silent
in
the
i
am
silent
on
a
bally
peak
in
darien
for
i
stuff
away
for
life
shoving
peas
in
with
a
knife
because
i
am
at
heart
a
vegetarian
no
more
the
milk
of
cows
shall
pollute
my
private
house
than
the
milk
of
the
wild
mares
of
the
barbarian
i
will
stick
to
port
and
sherry
for
they
are
so
very
very
so
very
very
very
vegetarian
the
saracen
head
the
saracen
head
looks
down
the
lane
where
we
shall
never
drink
wine
again
for
the
wicked
old
women
who
feel
have
turned
to
a
the
saracen
head
the
saracen
head
out
of
araby
came
king
richard
riding
in
arms
like
flame
and
where
he
established
his
folk
to
be
fed
he
set
up
a
spear
and
the
saracen
head
but
the
saracen
head
outlived
the
kings
it
thought
and
it
thought
of
most
horrible
things
of
health
and
of
soap
and
of
standard
bread
and
of
saracen
drinks
at
the
saracen
head
so
the
saracen
head
fulfils
its
name
they
drink
no
wine
a
ridiculous
game
and
i
shall
wonder
until
i
dead
how
it
ever
came
into
the
saracen
head
the
good
rich
man
mandragon
the
millionaire
he
would
have
wine
or
wife
he
could
endure
complexity
he
lived
the
simple
life
he
ordered
his
lunch
by
megaphone
in
manly
simple
tones
and
used
all
his
motors
for
canvassing
voters
and
twenty
telephones
besides
a
dandy
little
machine
cunning
and
neat
as
ever
was
seen
with
a
hundred
pulleys
and
cranks
between
made
of
metal
and
kept
quite
clean
to
hoist
him
out
of
his
healthful
bed
on
every
day
of
his
life
and
wash
him
and
dress
him
and
shave
him
and
brush
him
to
live
the
simple
life
mandragon
was
most
refined
and
quietly
neatly
dressed
say
all
the
american
newspapers
that
know
refinement
best
quiet
and
neat
the
hat
and
hair
and
the
coat
quiet
and
neat
a
trouser
worn
upon
either
leg
while
boots
adorn
the
feet
and
not
as
any
one
would
expect
a
tiger
skin
all
striped
and
specked
and
a
peacock
hat
with
the
tail
erect
a
scarlet
tunic
with
sunflowers
decked
which
might
have
had
a
more
marked
effect
and
pleased
the
pride
of
a
weaker
man
that
yearned
for
wine
or
wife
but
fame
and
the
flagon
for
mandragon
obscured
the
simple
life
mandragon
the
millionaire
i
am
happy
to
say
is
dead
he
enjoyed
a
quiet
funeral
in
a
crematorium
shed
and
he
lies
there
fluffy
and
soft
and
grey
and
certainly
quite
refined
when
he
might
have
rotted
to
flowers
and
fruit
with
adam
and
all
mankind
or
been
eaten
by
wolves
athirst
for
blood
or
burnt
on
a
good
tall
pyre
of
wood
in
a
towering
flame
as
a
heathen
should
or
even
sat
with
us
here
at
food
merrily
taking
twopenny
ale
and
pork
with
a
but
this
was
luxury
not
for
one
that
went
for
the
simple
life
the
song
against
songs
the
song
of
the
sorrow
of
melisande
is
a
weary
song
and
a
dreary
song
the
glory
of
mariana
grange
had
got
into
great
decay
the
song
of
the
raven
never
more
has
never
been
called
a
cheery
song
and
the
brightest
things
in
baudelaire
are
anything
else
but
gay
but
who
will
write
us
a
riding
song
or
a
hunting
song
or
a
drinking
song
fit
for
them
that
arose
and
rode
when
day
and
the
wine
were
red
but
bring
me
a
quart
of
claret
out
and
i
will
write
you
a
clinking
song
a
song
of
war
and
a
song
of
wine
and
a
song
to
wake
the
dead
the
song
of
the
fury
of
fragolette
is
a
florid
song
and
a
torrid
song
the
song
of
the
sorrow
of
tara
is
sung
to
a
harp
unstrung
the
song
of
the
cheerful
shropshire
lad
i
consider
a
perfectly
horrid
song
and
the
song
of
the
happy
futurist
is
a
song
that
ca
be
sung
but
who
will
write
us
a
riding
song
or
a
fighting
song
or
a
drinking
song
fit
for
the
fathers
of
you
and
me
that
knew
how
to
think
and
thrive
but
the
song
of
beauty
and
art
and
love
is
simply
an
utterly
stinking
song
to
double
you
up
and
drag
you
down
and
damn
your
soul
alive
me
heart
i
come
from
castlepatrick
and
me
heart
is
on
me
sleeve
and
any
sword
or
pistol
boy
can
hit
it
with
me
leave
it
shines
there
for
an
epaulette
as
golden
as
a
flame
as
naked
as
me
ancestors
as
noble
as
me
name
for

their
heart
is

they
go
to

around

though

down

king

fled

him
in

no
man

would
trace
and
praise
his
every
act
or
argue
that
he
was
in
fact
a
strict

not
by
him
the

have
lost
their
fancies
free
and
though
he
was
extremely
big
he
did
not
break

between

great
collingwood
walked
down

might
still
be

as
oaken
as
the
beams
above
when
the
great
lover
sailors

was
kissed

at

but
though
for
him
the
fell
to
build
the

the
woodman
worshipped

he
smote

in

the
road
to

some
say
that
guy
of
warwick
the
man
that
killed
the
cow
and
brake
the
mighty
boar
alive
beyond
the
bridge
at
slough
went
up
against
a
loathly
worm
that
wasted
all
the
downs
and
so
the
roads
they
twist
and
squirm
if
i
may
be
allowed
the
term
from
the
writhing
of
the
stricken
worm
that
died
in
seven
towns
i
see
no
scientific
proof
that
this
idea
is
sound
and
i
should
say
they
wound
about
to
find
the
town
of
roundabout
the
merry
town
of
roundabout
that
makes
the
world
go
round
some
say
that
robin
goodfellow
whose
lantern
lights
the
meads
to
steal
a
phrase
sir
walter
scott
in
heaven
no
longer
needs
such
dance
around
the
the
moonstruck
lover
leads
which
superstition
i
should
scout
there
is
more
faith
in
honest
doubt
as
tennyson
has
pointed
out
than
in
those
nasty
creeds
but
peace
and
righteousness
john
in
roundabout
can
kiss
and
since
that
all
that
found
about
the
pleasant
town
of
roundabout
the
roads
they
simply
bound
about
to
find
out
where
it
is
some
say
that
when
sir
lancelot
went
forth
to
find
the
grail
grey
merlin
wrinkled
up
the
roads
for
hope
that
he
should
fail
all
roads
led
back
to
lyonesse
and
camelot
in
the
vale
i
can
not
yield
assent
to
this
extravagant
hypothesis
the
plain
shrewd
briton
will
dismiss
such
rumours
but
in
the
streets
of
roundabout
are
no
such
factions
found
or
theories
to
expound
about
or
roll
upon
the
ground
about
in
the
happy
town
of
roundabout
that
makes
the
world
go
round
the
song
of
the
strange
ascetic
if
i
had
been
a
heathen
i
have
praised
the
purple
vine
my
slaves
should
dig
the
vineyards
and
i
would
drink
the
wine
but
higgins
is
a
heathen
and
his
slaves
grow
lean
and
grey
that
he
may
drink
some
tepid
milk
exactly
twice
a
day
if
i
had
been
a
heathen
i
have
crowned
neoera
curls
and
filled
my
life
with
love
affairs
my
house
with
dancing
girls
but
higgins
is
a
heathen
and
to
lecture
rooms
is
forced
where
his
aunts
who
are
not
married
demand
to
be
divorced
if
i
had
been
a
heathen
i
have
sent
my
armies
forth
and
dragged
behind
my
chariots
the
chieftains
of
the
north
but
higgins
is
a
heathen
and
he
drives
the
dreary
quill
to
lend
the
poor
that
funny
cash
that
makes
them
poorer
still
if
i
had
been
a
heathen
i
have
piled
my
pyre
on
high
and
in
a
great
red
whirlwind
gone
roaring
to
the
sky
but
higgins
is
a
heathen
and
a
richer
man
than
i
and
they
put
him
in
an
oven
just
as
if
he
were
a
pie
now
who
that
runs
can
read
it
the
riddle
that
i
write
of
why
this
poor
old
sinner
should
sin
without
delight
but
i
i
can
not
read
it
although
i
run
and
run
of
them
that
do
not
have
the
faith
and
will
not
have
