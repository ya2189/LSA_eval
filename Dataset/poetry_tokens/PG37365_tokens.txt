the

and

scorn
not
the
old
was
sacred
in
its
day
a
truth
overpowering
error
with
its
might
a
light
dispelling
darkness
with
its
ray
a
victory
won
an
intermediate
height
which
seers
untrammel
by
their

of

heroes
and

triumphantly
attained
with
hard
assail
and
tribulation
sore
that
we
might
use
the
they
gain
scorn
not
the
old
but
hail
and
seize
the
new
with
thrill
intelligences
hearts
that
burn
and
such
spirits
that
it
too
may
soon
be
superseded
in
its
turn
and
men
may
ever
as
the
ages
roll
march
onward
toward
the
still
receding
goal
how
many
a
man
how
many
a
man
of
those
i
see
around
has
cherished
fair
ideals
in
his
youth
and
heard
the
spirit
call
and
stood
spellbound
before
the
shrine
of
beauty
or
of
truth
and
lived
to
see
his
fair
ideals
fade
and
feel
a
numbness
creep
upon
his
soul
and
sadly
know
himself
no
longer
swayed
by
rigorous
truth
or
beauty
sweet
control
for
some
alas
life
thread
is
almost
spun
few
few
and
poor
the
fibres
that
remain
but
yet
while
life
lasts
something
may
be
done
to
make
the
heavenly
vision
not
in
vain
yet
even
yet
some
triumph
may
be
won
yea
loss
itself
be
turned
to
precious
gain
the
saddest
thought
sad
is
the
wane
of
beauty
to
the
fair
sad
is
the
flux
of
fortune
to
the
proud
sad
is
the
look
dejected
lovers
wear
and
sad
is
worth
beneath
detraction
cloud
sad
is
our
youth
inexorable
end
sad
is
the
bankruptcy
of
fancy
wealth
sad
is
the
last
departure
of
a
friend
and
sadder
than
most
things
is
loss
of
health
and
yet
more
sad
than
these
to
think
upon
is
this
the
saddest
thought
beneath
the
sun
life
flowing
like
a
river
almost
gone
into
eternity
and
nothing
done
let
me
be
spared
that
bootless
last
regret
let
me
work
now
i
may
do
something
yet
the
as
one
who
finds
his
house
no
longer
fit
too
narrow
for
his
needs
in
nothing
right
wanting
in
every
homelike
requisite
devoid
of
beauty
barren
of
delight
goes
forth
from
door
to
door
and
street
to
street
with
expectancy
to
find
a
new
abode
for
his
convenience
meet
spacious
commodious
fair
and
to
his
mind
so
living
souls
recurrently
outgrow
their
mental
tenements
their
tastes
appear
too
sordid
and
their
aims
too
cramped
and
low
and
they
keep
moving
onward
year
by
year
each
dwelling
in
its
turn
prepared
to
leave
for
one
more
like
the
mansion
they
conceive
on
moving
into
a
new
house
heaven
bless
this
new
abode
defend
its
doors
against
the
entry
of
malignant
sprites
gaunt
poverty
pale
sickness
care
that
blights
and
its
thresholds
like
the
enchanted
shores
of
faery
isles
serene
amid
the
roars
of
baffled
seas
let
in
all
fair
delights
such
as
make
happy
days
and
restful
nights
to
tread
familiarly
its
charm√®d
floors
within
its
walls
let
moderate
plenty
reign
and
gracious
industry
and
cheerful
health
plenish
its
chambers
with
contentment
wealth
nor
let
high
joy
its
humble
roof
disdain
here
let
us
make
renewal
of
love
lease
and
dwell
with
piety
who
dwells
with
peace
literature
here
is
a
of
delights
a
sumptuous
feast
of
true
ambrosial
food
here
is
a
journey
among
goodly
sights
in
choice
society
or
solitude
here
is
a
treasury
of
gems
and
gold
of
purest
gold
and
gems
of

a
library
as
one
who
from
an
antechamber
dim
is
ushered
suddenly
to
his
surprise
before
a
gathering
of
the
great
and
wise
feels
for
the
moment
all
his
senses
swim
then
looks
around
him
like
a
veteran
grim
when
peerless
armies
pass
before
his
eyes
or
michael
when
he
marshals
in
the
skies
the
embattled
legions
of
the
cherubim
so
shall
the
scholar
pause
within
this
door
with
startled
reverence
and
proudly
stand
and
feel
that
though
the
ages
flags
are
furled
by
time
rude
breath
their
spoils
are
here
in
store
the
riches
of
the
race
are
at
his
hand

the
glory

it
could
not

foul
ambition
fed
by

scout
the
task
that
too
ignoble
seemed
and
in
snug
corners
serpentlike

lurk
where
no
one
of

ever
dreamed
he
never

satisfying
joy

new

years

their
telltale
rings
upon

tree
of
time
since
he
appeared
milton
to
be
remembered
and
revered
whose
spirit
mounted
on
seraphic
wings
who
saw
though
blind
extraordinary
things
who
wrought
in
obloquy
and
persevered
and
with
his
great
music
reared
a
monument
surpassing
those
of
kings
three
hundred
years
courageous
lofty
soul
hast
thou
by
precept
and
example
taught
thy
lesson
have
we
learned
it
as
we
ought
have
we
moved
upward
nearer
to
the
goal
yea
somewhat
have
we
learned
be
with
us
still
and
teach
us
man
high
function
to
fulfil
burns
we
read
his
life
of
poverty
and
bane
from
weakness
folly
error
not
exempt
and
turn
aside
with
a
depressing
pain
compassion
tinged
with
something
like
contempt
we
read
his
work
and
see
his
human
heart
his
manly
mind
his
true
if
thwarted
will
and
all
that
noblest
in
us
takes
his
part
and
shames
our
former
verdict
will
or
nill
his
was
a
fiery
spirit
that
unbound
men
fetters
sometimes
leading
him
astray
he
was
a
seed
that
fell
into
the
ground
and
brought
forth
fruit
he
cast
himself
away
like
bread
upon
the
waters
and
was
found
to
nourish
worth
in
many
an
after
day
a
late
spring
twelve
weeks
had
passed
how
slowly
day
by
day
since
formal
dull
sir
calendar
had
bowed
old
winter
from
the
scene
and
cried
make
way
the
spring
the
spring
and
still
a
sullen
cloud
obscured
the
sky
and
the
north
wind
blew
chill
when
lo
one
morn
the
miracle
began
a
presence
brooded
over
vale
and
hill
and
through
all
life
a
quickening
impulse
ran
forgotten
melodies
awoke
within
my
soul
the
rapture
of
the
boy
refilled
me
my
arid
being
broke
a
brimming
tide
of
elemental
joy
from
primal
deeps
and
all
my
happy
springs
came
back
to
me
i
was
the
peer
of
kings
autumn
from
shy
expectancy
to
burgeoning
from
burgeoning
to
ripeness
and
decline
the
seasons
run
their
various
course
and
bring
again
at
last
the
sober
days
benign
and
spring
pied
garland
worn
for
beauty
sake
and
summer
crown
of
pride
less
fair
appear
than
the
subdued
enchanted
tints
that
make
the
aureole
of
the
senescent
year
so
grows
the
good
man
old
meek
glad
sublime
more
lovely
than
in
all
his
youthful
bloom
grander
than
in
the
vigor
of
his
prime
he
lights
with
radiance
life
autumnal
gloom
and
through
the
fading
avenue
of
time
walks
in
triumphal
glory
to
his
tomb
an
autumn
walk
adown
the
track
that
skirts
the
shallow
stream
i
wandered
with
blank
mind
a
bypath
drew
my
aimless
steps
aside
and
ere
i
knew
the
forest
closed
around
me
like
a
dream
the
sward
the
horizontal
gleam
of
the
low
sun
pouring
its
splendors
through
the
vistas
filled
the
view
and
everlasting
beauty
was
supreme
i
knew
not
past
or
future
was
a
mood
transcending
time
and
taking
in
the
whole
i
was
both
young
and
old
my
lost
childhood
years
yet
unlived
were
gathered
round
one
goal
and
death
was
there
familiar
long
i
stood
and
in
eternity
renewed
my
soul

of

father
laying

made

stand
to

moral
and
amen

not
the
richest
and
most
fertile
land
that
always
bears
the
noblest
breed
of
men
although
the
work
seems
unfinished
it
concludes
with
a
sentence
which
can
not
have
been
placed
casually
at
the
end
that
as
the
great
cyrus
was
supposed
to
have
said
is
not
always
the
richest
and
most
fertile
country
which
produces
the
most
valiant
men
on
the
work
of
the
immigrants
from
lands
where
old
abuses
sit
entrenched
and
stern
restriction
thwarts
aspiring
merit
and
by
gaunt
men
a
meagre
dole
is
wrenched
from
the
unkind
conditions
they
inherit
from
teeming
cities
where
the
ceaseless
moan
of
want
is
burthen
to
the
traffic
hum
from
shrouded
mills
and
fields
they
might
own
from
servitude
and
blank
despair
they
come
and

across

that
rushes
from

stirs

some
were

a

a

in

an

from

to

this

whereof
so
many
prate
to
have
the
that
turns

earth
common
blessings
to

and
in
accumulation
to
grow

nay
but
to
see
and
undertake
with
zest
the
good
most
in
agreement
with
our
powers
to
strive
if
need
be
for
the
second
best
but
still
to
strive
and
glean
the
golden
hours
with
eyes
for
nature
and
a
mind
for
truth
and
the
brave
loving
joyous
heart
of
youth
the
exclusion
of
asiatics
is
our
renown
dominion
then
so
small
as
not
to
hold
this

or
are
her

so
pitiably
scant
as
not

yield
a

to
all

are
we
lesser

better
than

that

with

nay

our

is
large
and
rich
enough
for
us
and
ours
and
millions
more
her
need
is
working

she
cries
to
let
them
in
nor

we
fear
our

we
have
no
strivings
and
no
for

our
souls
are
dead
so
judged
i
till
the
day
when
news
was
rife
of
fire
besieging
scholars
and
their
dames
and
bravely
one
gave
up
her
own
fair
life
in
saving
the
most
helpless
from
the
flames
then
when
i
heard
the
instantaneous
cheer
that
broke
with
sobbing
undertones
from
all
the
multitude
and
watched
them
drawing
near
stricken
and
mute
around
her
funeral
pall
in
grief
and
exultation
i
confest
my
judgment
erred
we
know
and
love
the
best
an
aristocrat
her
fair
companions
she
outshone
as
this
or
that
transcendent
star
makes
all
its
sister
orbs
look
wan
and
dim
and
lustreless
and
far
her
charm
impressed
the
fleeting
glance
but
chiefly
the
reflective
mind
a
century
inheritance
by
nurture
still
refined
devotions
manners
hopes
that
were
ideals
high
traditions
fine
were
felt
to
culminate

efflorescence
of
her
line
what
time
and
cost
conspired
to
trace
her
lineaments
of
perfect
grace
in

can
the
man
whose
uneventful
days
each
like
the
other
are
obscurely
spent
amid
the
mill
dead
products
keep
his
gaze
upon
a
lofty

serenely
bent

he
who
sedulously
tells

groups
their

shadows
with
deft
or
who
above

his

and

his

and
his
heart
was
gay
green
be
his
grave
and
peaceful
be
his
rest
alone
with
nature
the
rain
came
suddenly
and
to
the
shore
i
paddled
and
took
refuge
in
the
wood
and
leaning
on
my
paddle
there
i
stood
in
mild
contentment
watching
the
downpour
feeling
as
oft
i
have
felt
heretofore
rooted
in
nature
that
supremest
mood
when
all
the
strength
the
peace
of
solitude
sink
into
and
pervade
the
being
core
and
i
have
thought
if
man
could
but
abate
his
need
of
human
fellowship
and
find
himself
through
nature
healing
with
her
balm
the
world
sharp
wounds
and
growing
in
her
state
what
might
and
greatness
majesty
of
mind
sublimity
of
soul
and
godlike
calm
the
works
of
man
and
of
nature
man
works
grow
stale
to
man
the
years
destroy
the
charm
they
once
possessed
the
city
tires
the
terraces
the
domes
the
dazzling
spires
are
in
the
main
but
an
attractive
toy
they
please
the
man
not
as
they
pleased
the
boy
and
he
returns
to
nature
and
requires
to
warm
his
soul
at
her
old
altar
fires
to
drink
from
her
perpetual
fount
of
joy
it
is
that
man
and
all
the
works
of
man
prepare
to
pass
away
he
may
depend
on
naught
but
what
he
found
her
stores
among
but
she
she
changes
not
nor
ever
can
he
knows
she
will
be
faithful
to
the
end
for
ever
beautiful
for
ever
young
a
day
redeemed
i
rose
and
idly
sauntered
to
the
pane
and
on
the
mountain
bent
my
look
and
standing
there
a
sad
review
i
took
of
what
the
day
had
brought
me
what
the
gain
to
wisdom
store
what
holds
had
knowledge
i
mused
upon
the
book
the
erring
thought
and
felt
a
stern
rebuke
alas
alas
the
day
hath
been
in
vain
but
as
i
gazed
upon
the
upper
blue
with
many
a
twining
jasper
ridge
sudden
swung
upon
my
view
a
molten
rolling
cloud
my
spirit
stood
and
caught
its
glorious
hue
not
lost
the
day
it
leaping
cried
aloud
outremont
far
stretched
the
landscape
fair
without
a
flaw
down
to
one
silver
sheet
some
stream
or
cloud
through
glamorous
mists
midway
an
engine
ploughed
across
the
scene
in
meditative
awe
i
stood
and
gazed
absorbed
in
what
i
saw
till
evening
came
the
and
creeping
from
the
city
spread
her
shroud
over
the
sunlit
slopes
of
outremont
soon
the
mild
indian
summer
will
be
past
november
mists
soon
flee
december
snows
the
trees
may
perish
and
the
winter
blast
wreck
the
tall
windmills
these
weak
eyes
may
close
but
ever
will
that
scene
continue
fast
fixed
in
my
soul
where
richer
still
it
grows
the
new
old
story
hard
by
an
ancient
mansion
stood
an
oak
for
centuries
was
said
it
had
been
there
the
old
towers
crumbled
decay
slow
stroke
while
hall
by
hall
upgrew
a
palace
fair
lives
and
momentous
eras
waxed
and
waned
old
barons
died
and
barons
young
and
gay
ruled
in
their
stead
and
still
the
oak
remained
and
each
new
spring
seemed
older
not
a
day
the
vesture
of
the
spirit
of
mankind
forms
and
beliefs
like
meteors
rise
and
set
the
spirit
too
doth
change
but
the
mind
this
old
evangel
holds
young
lordship

the

give
me
a
cottage
embower
in
trees
far
from
the
press
and
the
din
of
the
town
there
let
me
loiter
and
live
at
my
ease
happier
far
than
the
king
with
his
crown
there
let
the
music
that
sweeter
than
words
waken
my
soul
inarticulate
song
murmur
of
zephyrs
and
warbling
of
birds
babble
of
waters
that
hurry
along
under
the
shade
of
the
maple
and
beech
let
me
in
tranquil
contentment
recline
learning
what
nature
and
solitude
teach
charming
philosophy

finding
how
trivial
the
myriad
things
life
is
concern
with
to
seek
or
to
shun

the

blessedness
springs

where
are
all
your
roses
now
those
wonderful

that
made
such
garlands
for
the

of
your

they
in

rejoices
to
renew
her
vernal
youth
by
lawn

and
sap
mounts
upward
in
the

and
ruddy
buds
come
bursting
through
when
violets
of
tender
hue
and
trilliums
keep
the
morning

through
all
the
sweet

give
me
an

day
when
surly
winter
roystering
crew
have
said
the
last
of
their
adieux
and
left
the
fettered
river
free
and
buoyant
hope

the

preacher
it
was
back
in
renfrew
county
near
the
opeongo
line
where
the
land
all
hills
and
hollows
and
the
hills
are
clothed
with
pine
and
in
the
wooded
valleys
little
lakes
shine
here
and
there
like
jewels
in
the
masses
of
a
lovely
woman
hair
where
the
york
branch
by
a
channel
ripped
through
rugged
rocks
and
sand
sweeps
to
join
the
madawaska
speeding
downward
to
the
grand
where
the
landscape
glows
with
beauty
like
a
halo
shed
abroad
and
the
face
of
nature
mirrors
back
the
unseen
face
of
god
i
was
weary
with
my
journey
and
with
difficulty
strove
to
keep
myself
awake
at
first
as
sitting
by
the
stove
in
old
william
rankin
shanty
i
attended
as
i
might
to
the
pioneer
backwoodsman
tales
far
on
into
the
night
but
william
talked
until
the
need
of
sleep
one
quite
forgot
not
stopping
but
to
stir
the
fire
which
kept
the
stove
for
the
wind
was
raw
and
cold
without
although
the
month
of
may
up
north
the
winter
struggles
hard
before
it
yields
its
sway
and
the
snow
is
in
the
forests
and
the
ice
is
in
the
lakes
and
the
frost
is
in
the
seedland
oft
when
sunny
june
awakes
he
talked
of
camps
in
winter
time
of
river
drives
in
spring
of
discords
in
the
settlement
in
fact
of
everything
he
told
of
one
good
elder
who
been
eaten
by
a
bear
and
wondered
that
a
beast
of
prey
should
eat
a
man
of
of
beast
from
wolf
to
porcupine
killed
with
gun
axe
and
fork
and
finally
of
college
men
who
did
not
pine
for
pork
but
yet
among
them
students
said
the
bushman
there
wuz
one
as
hit
me
an
the
settlement
as
fair
as
any
gun
o
course
he
no
buster
hed
no
shinin
gifts
o

but
jis
as
he
could
give
some
pointers
how
to
preach
he
talked
straight
on
like
tellin
yarns
more
heart
i
say

but
somehow
people
felt
he
meant
every
word
he
said
he
chuck
full
o
larnin
from
the
peelin
to
the
core
leastwise
he
the
kind
they
call
a
college
he

said
though
soon
he
let
see
that
o
certain
sterlin
qualities
he
had
a
great
degree
leastwise
he
hed
no
letters
till
the
hind
end
o
his
name
but

say
you

set
much
importance
by
them

from
the
riverind
father
blake
he
taught
me
latin
grammar
and
he
after
taught
me
grake
till
oi
could
rade
the
classics
in
a
distint
sort
of
way
was
the
sadetoime
of
the
harvist
that
oi
rapin
ivery
day
my
parients
thought
me
monsthrous
shmart
of
thim
was
awful
koind
and
where
oi
go
to
college
now
was
what
perplixed
their
moind
so
they
axed
the
riverind
father
blake
what
varsity
was
bist
to
make
a
docthor
bachelor
and
lawyer
and
the
rist
said
father
blake
if
oi
must
make
decision
faith
oi
will
sure
sind
the
boy
to
munthreal
there
none
loike
ould
mcgill
so
oi
came
to
munthreal
and
found
mcgill
one
afternoon
and
saw
a
great
excoited
crowd
all
shoutin
out
of
tune
and
in
the
cintre
thorty
min
was
foightin
jist
loike
mad
and
two
big
fellows
on
the
top
of
one
poor
little
lad
oi
turned
indignant
to
the
crowd
and
tould
them
to
their
face
ye
pack
of
coward
savages
onciviloized
and
base
to
stand
and
see
two
stalwart
min
abusin
one
that
way
oi
loike
a
gladiatorial
show
but
loike
to
see
fair
play
so
oi
jumped
at
those
two
bullies
and
oi
caught
thim
by
the
shirt
and
oi
knocked
their
hids
together
and
consoigned
thim
to
the
dirt
oi
was
removed
and
they
were
carried
home
but
all
the
same
though
ould
mcgill
was
two
min
short
she
won
that
football
game
they
thought
oi
was
a
tough
gussoon
and
whin
they
played
agin
they
put
me
in
the
scrimmage
we
got
to
tin
oi
thin
wint
up
to
college
whin
the
lictures
would
begin
oi
attinded
ivery
licture
when
oi
happened
to
be
in
got
my
work
up
kipt
my
in
the
illigantist
shape
oi
took
notes
of
ivery
licture
barrin
whin
oi
was
ashlape
but
och
oi
try
to
do
my
bist
for
sure
it
father
blake
as
says
the
foinist
faculty
is
arts
and
no
mistake
for
there
they
tache
philosophy
and
english
literature
the
mathematics
also
and
the
classic
authors
sure
oi
larned
the
gracian
poethry
oi
larned
the
latin
prose
oi
know
as
much
about
thim
both
as
my
profissor
knows
how
troy
that
had
for
noine
long
years
defoied
the
graycian
force
was
hors
de
combat
put
at
last
by
jist
a
wooden
horse
how
xerxes
wipt
because
his
army
soon
would
pass
away
and
alexander
wipt
because
there
were
no
more
to
shlay
how
cato
from
his
toga
plucked
the
carthaginian
fruit
how
brutus
murdered
saysar
and
how
saysar
called
him
brute
oi
the
honor
of
a
mornin
with
an
influential
med
and
he
took
me
to
the
room
in
which
they
mutilate
the
dead
oi
do
objict
to
crack
a
skull
or
spoil
a
purty
face
but
to
hack
a
man
who
dead
is
what
oi
called
extramely
base
but
all
pursonal
convictions
he
explained
should
be
resoigned
for
the
binifit
of
scoience
and
the
good
of
humankoind
and
though
oi
do
at
all
admoire
their
ways
o
goin
on
oi
take
a
course
in
medicine
oi
will
before
oi
gone
oi
saw
the
scoience
workshops
too
and
thought
whin
oi
was
made
these
little
hands
were
niver
mint
to
larn
the
blacksmith
trade
and
for
that
illictricity
the
thing
what
gives
the
shock
they
collared
old
promaytheus
and
chained
him
to
a
rock
for
with
the
loightnin
and
to
the
skoies
and
the
vultures
gnawed
his
vittles
and
the
crows
picked
out
his
oyes
but
toimes
has
changed
and
larnin
gives
us
power
do
you
see
and
whin
oi
done
with
arts
oi
take
that
shplindid
faculty
for
sure
it
from
their
workshops
that
the
solar
system
run
besoides
they
make
the
wither
too
and
rigilate
the
sun
oi
troied
exams
at
christmas
and
oi
did
pass
at
all
but
oi
can
have
another
whack
at
thim
nixt
spring
and
fall
in
toime
oi
pass
in
iverything
and
masther
all
they
taiche
oi
go
through
ivery
faculty
and
come
out
hid
in
aiche
and
whin
oi
conquered
all
loike
alexander
oi
will
soigh
there
is
no
more
to
conquer
and
oi
lay
me
down
and
doie
they
birry
me
with
honors
and
erict
in
my
behalf
a
monimint
which
shall
disphlay
the
followin
epitaph
here
loies
shwate
tim
sure
he
had
wits
to
shpare
his
father
came
from
donegal
his
mother
came
from
clare
he
was
a
shplindid
scholar
for
he
studied
at
mcgill
he
drank
the
well
of
larnin
dhroy
and
faith
he
got
his
fill
was
niver
mortal
craythur
larned
to

a
great
