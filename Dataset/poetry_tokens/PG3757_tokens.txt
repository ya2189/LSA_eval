the

i
legend
long
ago
apollo
called
to
aristaeus
youngest
of
the
shepherds
saying
i
will
make
you
keeper
of
my
bees
golden
were
the
hives
and
golden
was
the
honey
golden
too
the
music
where
the
hummed
among
the
trees
happy
aristaeus
loitered
in
the
garden
wandered
in
the
orchard
careless
and
contented
indolent
and
free
lightly
took
his
labour
lightly
took
his
pleasure
till
the
fated
moment
when
across
his
pathway
came
eurydice
then
her
eyes
enkindled
burning
love
within
him
drove
him
wild
with
longing
for
the
perfect
sweetness
of
her
face
eagerly
he
followed
while
she
fled
before
him
over
mead
and
mountain
on
through
field
and
forest
in
a
breathless
race
but
the
nymph
in
flying
trod
upon
a
serpent
like
a
dream
she
vanished
pluto
chariot
bore
her
down
among
the
dead
lonely
aristaeus
sadly
home
returning
found
his
garden
empty
all
the
hives
deserted
all
the
music
fled
mournfully
bewailing
ah
my
where
have
you
departed
far
and
wide
he
sought
them
over
sea
and
shore
foolish
is
the
tale
that
says
he
ever
found
them
brought
them
home
in
triumph
joys
that
once
escape
us
fly
for
evermore
yet
i
dream
that
somewhere
clad
in
downy
whiteness
dwell
the
in
aerial
gardens
that
no
mortal
sees
and
at
times
returning
lo
they
flutter
round
us
gathering
mystic
harvest
so
i
weave
the
legend
of
the
bees
ii
the
swarming
of
the
bees
i
who
can
tell
the
hiding
of
the
white
nest
who
can
trace
the
guiding
of
their
swift
home
flight
far
would
be
his
riding
on
a
quest
surely
ere
it
ended
would
his
beard
grow
white
never
in
the
coming
of
the
spring
never
in
the
passing
of
the
fall
may
you
hear
the
humming
of
the
white
wing
murmur
the
meadow
ere
the
night
bells
call
wait
till
winter
hardens
in
the
cold
grey
sky
wait
till
leaves
are
fallen
and
the
brooks
all
freeze
then
above
the
gardens
where
the
dead
flowers
lie
swarm
the
merry
millions
of
the
wild
white
bees
ii
out
of
the
airy
hive
deep
in
the
clouds
that
veil
the
sun
look
how
the
first
of
the
swarm
arrive
timidly
venturing
one
by
one
down
through
the
tranquil
air
wavering
here
and
there
large
and
lazy
in
flight
caught
by
a
lift
of
the
breeze
tangled
among
the
naked
trees
dropping
then
without
a
sound
to
their
rest
on
the
ground
iii
thus
the
swarming
is
begun
count
the
leaders
every
one
perfect
as
a
perfect
star
till
the
slow
descent
is
done
look
beyond
them
see
how
far
down
the
vistas
dim
and
grey
multitudes
are
on
the
way
now
a
sudden
brightness
dawns
within
the
sombre
day
over
fields
of
whiteness
and
the
sky
is
swiftly
alive
with
the
flutter
and
the
flight
of
the
shimmering
bees
that
pour
from
the
hidden
door
of
the
hive
till
you
can
count
no
more
iv
now
on
the
branches
of
hemlock
and
pine
thickly
they
settle
and
cluster
and
swing
bending
them
low
and
the
trellised
vine
and
the
dark
are
traced
with
a
line
of
beauty
wherever
the
white
bees
cling
now
they
are
hiding
the
wrecks
of
the
flowers
softly
softly
covering
all
over
the
grave
of
the
summer
hours
spreading
a
silver
pall
now
they
are
building
the
broad
roof
ledge
into
a
cornice
smooth
and
fair
moulding
the
terrace
from
edge
to
edge
into
the
sweep
of
a
marble
stair
wonderful
workers
swift
and
dumb
numberless
myriads
still
they
come
thronging
ever
faster
faster
faster
where
is
their
queen
who
is
their
master
the
gardens
are
faded
the
fields
are
frore
how
will
they
fare
in
a
world
so
bleak
where
is
the
hidden
honey
they
seek
what
is
the
sweetness
they
toil
to
store
in
the
desolate
day
where
no
blossoms
gleam
forgetfulness
and
a
dream
v
but
now
the
fretful
wind
awakes
i
hear
him
girding
at
the
trees
he
strikes
the
bending
boughs
and
shakes
the
quiet
clusters
of
the
bees
to
powdery
drift
he
tosses
them
away
he
drives
them
like
spray
he
makes
them
veer
and
shift
around
his
blustering
path
in
clouds
blindly
whirling
in
rings
madly
swirling
full
of
crazy
wrath
so
furious
and
fast
they
fly
they
blur
the
earth
and
blot
the
sky
in
wild
white
mirk
they
fill
the
air
with
frozen
wings
and
tiny
angry
icy
stings
they
blind
the
eyes
and
choke
the
breath
they
dance
a
maddening
dance
of
death
around
their
work
sweeping
the
cover
from
the
hill
heaping
the
hollows
deeper
still
effacing
every
line
and
mark
and
swarming
storming
in
the
dark
through
the
long
night
until
at
dawn
the
wind
lies
down
weary
of
fight
the
last
torn
cloud
with
trailing
gown
passes
the
open
gates
of
light
and
the
white
bees
are
lost
in
flight
vi
look
how
the
landscape
glitters
wide
and
still
bright
with
a
pure
surprise
the
day
begins
with
joy
and
all
past
ill
buried
in
white
oblivion
lies
beneath
the
snowdrifts
under
crystal
skies
new
hope
new
love
new
life
new
cheer
flow
in
the
sunrise
beam
the
gladness
of
apollo
when
he
sees
upon
the
bosom
of
the
wintry
year
the
of
his
wild
white
bees
forgetfulness
and
a
dream
iii
legend
listen
my
beloved
while
the
silver
morning
like
a
tranquil
vision
fills
the
world
around
us
and
our
hearts
with
peace
quiet
is
the
close
of
aristaeus
legend
happy
is
the
ending
listen
while
i
tell
you
how
he
found
release
many
months
he
wandered
far
away
in
sadness
desolately
thinking
only
of
the
vanished
joys
he
could
not
find
till
the
great
apollo
pitying
his
shepherd
loosed
him
from
the
burden
of
a
dark
reluctant
mind
then
he
saw
around
him
all
the
changeful
beauty
of
the
changing
seasons
in
the
regions
where
his
journey
lay
birds
that
sang
to
cheer
him
flowers
that
bloomed
beside
him
stars
that
shone
to
guide
him
traveller
joy
was
plenty
all
along
the
way
everywhere
he
journeyed
strangers
made
him
welcome
listened
while
he
taught
them
secret
lore
of
field
and
forest
he
had
learned
how
to
train
the
vines
and
make
the
olives
ful
how
to
guard
the
sheepfolds
how
to
stay
the
fever
when
the
burned
friendliness
and
blessing
followed
in
his
steps
richer
were
the
harvests
happier
the
dwellings
he
came
little
children
loved
him
and
he
left
behind
him
in
the
hour
of
parting
memories
of
kindness
and
a
name
so
he
travelled
onward
desolate
no
longer
patient
in
his
seeking
reaping
all
the
wayside
comfort
of
his
quest
till
at
last
in
thracia
high
upon
mount
haemus
far
from
human
dwelling
weary
aristaeus
laid
him
down
to
rest
then
the
clad
in
downy
whiteness
fluttered
soft
around
him
wrapt
him
in
a
dreamful
slumber
pure
and
deep
this
is
life
beloved
first
a
sheltered
garden
then
a
troubled
journey
joy
and
pain
of
seeking
and
at
last
we
sleep
new
year
eve
i
the
other
night
i
had
a
dream
most
clear
and
comforting
complete
in
every
line
a
crystal
sphere
and
full
of
intimate
and
secret
cheer
therefore
i
will
repeat
that
vision
dearest
heart
to
you
as
of
a
thing
not
feigned
but
very
true
yes
true
as
ever
in
my
life
befell
and
you
perhaps
can
tell
whether
my
dream
was
really
sad
or
sweet
ii
the
shadows
flecked
the
street
i
knew
so
well
long
long
ago
and
on
the
pillared
porch
where
marguerite
had
sat
with
me
the
moonlight
lay
like
snow
but
she
my
comrade
and
my
friend
of
youth
most
gaily
wise
most
innocently
loved
she
of
the
eyes
that
ever
smiled
and
ever
spoke
the
truth
from
that
familiar
dwelling
where
she
moved
like
mirth
incarnate
in
the
years
before
had
gone
into
the
hidden
house
of
death
i
thought
the
garden
wore
white
mourning
for
her
blessed
innocence
and
the
syringa
breath
came
from
the
corner
by
the
fence
where
she
had
made
her
rustic
seat
with
fragrance
passionate
intense
as
if
it
breathed
a
sigh
for
marguerite
my
heart
was
heavy
with
a
sense
of
something
good
forever
gone
i
sought
vainly
for
some
consoling
thought
some
comfortable
word
that
i
could
say
to
the
sad
father
whom
i
visited
again
for
the
first
time
since
she
had
gone
away
the
bell
rang
shrill
and
lonely
then
the
door
was
opened
and
i
sent
my
name
to
him
but
ah
was
marguerite
who
came
there
in
the
dear
old
dusky
room
she
stood
beneath
the
lamp
just
as
she
used
to
stand
in
tender
mocking
mood
you
did
not
ask
for
me
she
said
and
so
i
will
not
let
you
take
my
hand
but
i
must
hear
what
secret
talk
you
planned
with
father
come
my
friend
be
good
and
tell
me
your
affairs
of
state
why
you
have
stayed
away
and
made
me
wait
so
long
sit
down
beside
me
here
and
do
you
know
it
seemed
a
year
since
we
have
talked
together
why
so
late
amazed
incredulous
confused
with
joy
i
hardly
dared
to
show
and
stammering
like
a
boy
i
took
the
place
she
showed
me
at
her
side
and
then
the
talk
flowed
on
with
brimming
tide
through
the
still
night
while
she
with
influence
light
controlled
it
as
the
moon
the
flood
she
knew
where
i
had
been
what
i
had
done
what
work
was
planned
and
what
begun
my
troubles
failures
fears
she
understood
and
touched
them
with
a
heart
so
kind
that
every
care
was
melted
from
my
mind
and
every
hope
grew
bright
and
life
seemed
moving
on
to
happy
ends
ah
what
fool
was
he
that
said
a
woman
can
not
be
the
very
best
of
friends
then
there
were
memories
of
old
times
recalled
with
many
a
gentle
jest
and
at
the
last
she
brought
the
book
of
rhymes
we
made
together
trying
to
translate
the
songs
of
heine
hers
were
always
best
now
come
she
said
we
will
collaborate
again
i
put
you
to
the
test
here
one
i
never
found
the
way
to
do
the
simplest
are
the
hardest
ones
you
know
i
give
this
song
to
you
and
then
she
read
mein
kind
wir
waren
kinder
zwei
kinder
jung
und
froh
but
all
the
while
a
silent
question
stirred
within
me
though
i
dared
not
speak
the
word
is
it
herself
and
is
she
truly
here
and
was
i
dreaming
when
i
heard
that
she
was
dead
last
year
or
was
it
true
and
is
she
but
a
shade
who
brings
a
fleeting
joy
to
eye
and
ear
cold
though
so
kind
and
will
she
gently
fade
when
her
sweet
ghostly
part
is
played
and
the
falls
at
dawn
of
day
but
while
my
heart
was
troubled
by
this
fear
so
deeply
that
i
could
not
speak
it
out
lest
all
my
happiness
should
disappear
i
thought
me
of
a
cunning
way
to
hide
the
question
and
dissolve
the
doubt
will
you
not
give
me
now
your
hand
dear
marguerite
i
asked
to
touch
and
hold
that
by
this
token
i
may
understand
you
are
the
same
true
friend
you
were
of
old
she
answered
with
a
smile
so
bright
and
calm
it
seemed
as
if
i
saw
new
stars
arise
in
the
deep
heaven
of
her
eyes
and
smiling
so
she
laid
her
palm
in
mine
dear
god
it
was
not
cold
but
warm
with
vital
heat
you
live
i
cried
you
live
dear
marguerite
then
i
awoke
but
strangely
comforted
although
i
knew
again
that
she
was
dead
iii
yes
there
the
dream
and
was
it
sweet
or
sad
dear
mistress
of
my
waking
and
my
sleep
present
reward
of
all
my
heart
desire
watching
with
me
beside
the
winter
fire
interpret
now
this
vision
that
i
had
but
while
you
read
the
meaning
let
me
keep
the
touch
of
you
for
the
old
year
with
storm
is
passing
through
the
midnight
and
doth
shake
the
corners
of
the
house
and
oh
my
heart
would
break
unless
both
dreaming
and
awake
my
hand
could
feel
your
hand
was
warm
warm
warm
songs
for
america
of
manhattan
children
of
the
elemental
mother
born
upon
some
lonely
island
shore
where
the
wrinkled
ripples
run
and
whisper
where
the
crested
billows
plunge
and
roar
tireless
roamers
and
adventurers
fearless
breasters
of
the
wind
and
sea
in
the
solitary
places
i
have
seen
you
floating
wild
and
free
here
the
cities
rise
around
you
here
the
cliffs
that
tower
east
and
west
honeycombed
with
human
habitations
have
no
hiding
for
the
nest
here
the
river
flows
begrimed
and
troubled
here
the
hurrying
panting
vessels
fume
restless
up
and
down
the
watery
highway
while
a
thousand
chimneys
vomit
gloom
toil
and
tumult
conflict
and
confusion
clank
and
clamor
of
the
vast
machine
human
hands
have
built
for
human
bondage
yet
amid
it
all
you
float
serene
circling
soaring
sailing
swooping
lightly
down
to
glean
your
harvest
from
the
wave
in
your
heritage
of
air
and
water
you
have
kept
the
freedom
nature
gave
even
so
the
of
manhattan
saw
your
wheeling
flocks
of
white
and
grey
even
so
you
fluttered
followed
floated
round
the
creeping
up
the
bay
even
so
your
voices
creaked
and
chattered
laughing
shrilly
the
tidal
rips
while
your
black
and
beady
eyes
were
glistening
round
the
sullen
british
children
of
the
elemental
mother
fearless
floaters
the
double
blue
from
the
crowded
boats
that
cross
the
ferries
many
a
longing
heart
goes
out
to
you
though
the
cities
climb
and
close
around
us
something
tells
us
that
our
souls
are
free
while
the
fly
above
the
harbor

chivalry
push
out
set
sail
explore
and
all
the
bars
at
which
we
fret
that
seem
to
prison
and
control
are
but
the
doors
of
daring
set
ajar
before
the
soul
say
not
too
poor
but
freely
give
sigh
not
too
weak
but
boldly
try
you
never
can
begin
to
live
until
you
dare
to
die
a
home
song
i
read
within
a
poet
book
a
word
that
starred
the
page
stone
walls
do
not
a
prison
make
nor
iron
bars
a
cage
yes
that
is
true
and
something
more
you
find
you
roam
that
marble
floors
and
gilded
walls
can
never
make
a
home
but
every
house
where
love
abides
and
friendship
is
a
guest
is
surely
home
and
for
there
the
heart
can
rest
a
noon
song
there
are
songs
for
the
morning
and
songs
for
the
night
for
sunrise
and
sunset
the
stars
and
the
moon
but
who
will
give
praise
to
the
fulness
of
light
and
sing
us
a
song
of
the
glory
of
noon
oh
the
high
noon
and
the
clear
noon
the
noon
with
golden
crest
when
the
sky
burns
and
the
sun
turns
with
his
face
to
the
way
of
the
west
how
swiftly
he
rose
in
the
dawn
of
his
strength
how
slowly
he
crept
as
the
morning
wore
by
ah
steep
was
the
climbing
that
led
him
at
length
to
the
height
of
his
throne
in
the
blue
summer
sky
oh
the
long
toil
and
the
slow
toil
the
toil
that
may
not
rest
till
the
sun
looks
down
from
his
crown
to
the
wonderful
way
of
the
west
an
american
in
europe
is
fine
to
see
the
old
world
and
travel
up
and
down
among
the
famous
palaces
and
cities
of
renown
to
admire
the
crumbly
castles
and
the
statues
of
the
kings
but
now
i
think
i
had
enough
of
antiquated
things
so
it
home
again
and
home
again
america
for
me
i
my
heart
is
turning
home
again
and
there
i
long
to
be
in
the
land
of
youth
and
freedom
beyond
the
ocean
bars
where
the
air
is
full
of
sunlight
and
the
flag
is
full
of
stars
oh
london
is
a
man
town
there
power
in
the
air
and
paris
is
a
woman
town
with
flowers
in
her
hair
and
it
sweet
to
dream
in
venice
and
it
great
to
study
rome
but
when
it
comes
to
living
there
is
no
place
like
home
i
like
the
german
in
green
battalions
drilled
i
like
the
gardens
of
versailles
with
flashing
fountains
filled
but
oh
to
take
your
hand
my
dear
and
ramble
for
a
day
in
the
friendly
western
woodland
where
nature
has
her
way
i
know
that
europe
wonderful
yet
something
seems
to
lack
the
past
is
too
much
with
her
and
the
people
looking
back
but
the
glory
of
the
present
is
to
make
the
future
free
we
love
our
land
for
what
she
is
and
what
she
is
to
be
oh
it
home
again
and
home
again
america
for
me
i
i
want
a
ship
that
westward
bound
to
plough
the
rotting
sea
to
the
blessed
land
of
room
enough
beyond
the
ocean
bars
where
the
air
is
full
of
sunlight
and
the
flag
is
full
of
stars
the
ancestral
dwellings
dear
to
my
heart
are
the
ancestral
dwellings
of
america
dearer
than
if
they
were
haunted
by
ghosts
of
royal
splendour
these
are
the
homes
that
were
built
by
the
brave
beginners
of
a
nation
they
are
simple
enough
to
be
great
and
full
of
a
friendly
dignity
i
love
the
old
white
farmhouses
nestled
in
new
england
valleys
ample
and
long
and
low
with
ing
over
them
borders
of
box
in
the
yard
and
lilacs
and
fashioned
flowers
a
above
the
door
and
little
square
panes
in
the
windows
the
piled
with
maple
and
birch
and
hickory
ready
for
winter
the
with
its
garret
crowded
with
household
relics
all
the
tokens
of
prudent
thrift
and
the
spirit
of
i
love
the
look
of
the
shingled
houses
that
front
the
ocean
their
backs
are
bowed
and
their
lichened
sides
are
soft
in
their
colour
as
grey
pearls
they
are
full
of
patience
and
courage
they
seem
to
grow
out
of
the
rocks
there
is
something
indomitable
about
them
pacing
the
briny
wind
in
a
lonely
land
they
stand
undaunted
while
the
thin
blue
line
of
smoke
from
the
chimney
rises
telling
of
shelter
for
man
with
room
for
a
hearth
and
a
cradle
i
love
the
stately
southern
mansions
with
their
tall
white
columns
they
look
through
avenues
of
trees
over
fields
where
the
cotton
is
growing
i
can
see
the
flutter
of
white
frocks
along
their
shady
porches
music
and
laughter
float
from
the
windows
the
yards
are
full
of
hounds
and
horses
they
have
all
ridden
away
yet
the
houses
have
not
forgotten
they
are
proud
of
their
name
and
place
and
their
doors
are
always
open
for
the
thing
they
remember
best
is
the
pride
of
their
ancient
hospitality
in
the
towns
i
love
the
discreet
and
tranquil
quaker
dwellings
with
their
demure
brick
faces
and
immaculate
doorsteps
and
the
gabled
houses
of
the
dutch
with
their
high
stoops
and
iron
railings
i
can
see
their
little
brass
knobs
shining
in
the
morning
sunlight
and
the
solid
houses
of
the
descendants
of
the
puritans
fronting
the
street
with
their
narrow
doors
and
and
the
mansions
of
charleston
standing
sideways
in
their
gardens
full
of
roses
and
magnolias
yes
they
are
all
dear
to
my
heart
and
in
my
eyes
they
are
beautiful
for
under
their
roofs
were
nourished
the
thoughts
that
have
made
the
nation
the
glory
and
strength
of
america
came
from
her
ancestral
dwellings
francis

to
thee

faithful

thou

that

unafraid

much
we
owe
to
thee

as

that

to
the

the
tribute
that
a
mighty
nation
pays
to
those
who
loved
her
well
in
former
days
means
more
than
gratitude
for
glories

for
every
noble
man
that
she
hath
bred
lives
in
the
bronze
and
marble
that
we
raise
immortalized
by

immortal

our

as

fortify
the

below
thy

in

strange
way
thou
lying

all
these
songs
of
nature
rhythmical
passionate
yearning
coming
in
music
from
earth
but
not
unto
earth
returning
dust
are
the
hearts
that
beat
in
time
to
these
measures
thou
hast
taken
them
back
to
thyself
secretly
irresistibly
drawing
the
crimson
currents
of
life
down
down
down
deep
into
thy
bosom
again
as
a
river
is
lost
in
the
sand

the
souls
of
the
singers
have
entered
into
the
songs
that
revealed
them
passionate
songs
immortal
songs
of
joy
and
grief
and
love
and
longing
floating
from
heart
to
heart
of
thy
children
they
echo
above
thee
do
they
not
utter
thy
heart
the
voices
of
those
that
love
thee
long
hadst
thou
lain
like
a
queen
transformed
by
some
old
enchantment
into
an
alien
shape
mysterious
beautiful
less
knowing
not
who
thou
wert
till
the
touch
of
thy
lord

working
within
thee
awakened
the
to
breathe
thy
secret
all
of
thy

thee
she
bared
her

and
bound
thee
to
her
with
a
double
vow
exquisite

ii
the
cause
the
cause
for
which
thy
soul
resigned
her
singing
robes
to
battle
on
the
plain
was
won
o
poet
and
was
lost
again
and
lost
the
labour
of
thy
lonely
mind
on
weary
tasks
of
prose
what
wilt
thou
find
to
comfort
thee
for
all
the
toil
and
pain
what
solace
now
thy
sacrifice
is
vain
and
thou
art
left
forsaken
poor
and
blind
like
comes
the
deep
reply
the
cause
of
truth
looks
lost
but
shall
be
won
for
god
hath
given
to
mine
inward
eye
vision
of
england
soaring
to

granted
me
great
peace

done

o
bend
again

thine
thou
blind
old
poet
longing
for
repose
thy
master
claims
thy
service
not
with
those
who
only
stand
and
wait
for
his
reward
he
pours
the
heavenly
gift
of
song
restored
into
thy
breast
and
bids
thee
nobly
close
a
noble
life
with
poetry
that
flows
in
mighty
music
of
the
major
chord
where
hast
thou
learned
this
deep
majestic
strain
surpassing
all
thy
youthful
lyric
grace
to
sing
of
paradise
ah
not
in
vain
the
griefs
that
won
at
dante
side
thy
place
and
made
thee

thy
years
of
pain

loftiest

wordsworth
thy
music
like
a
river
rolls
among
the
mountains

thy
song
is
fed
by
living
springs
far
up
the
watershed
no
whirling
flood
nor
parching
drought
controls
the
crystal
current
even
on
the
shoals
it
murmurs
clear
and
sweet
and
when
its
bed
darkens
below
mysterious
cliffs
of
dread
thy
voice
of
peace
grows
deeper
in
our
souls
but
thou
in
youth
hast
known
the
breaking
stress
of
passion
and
hast
trod
despair
dry
ground
beneath
black
thoughts
that
wither
and
stroy
ah

led
by
human
tenderness
home
to
the
heart

from

that

should

for
thee

when
the
crimson
stained
thy
pillow
thou
didst
read
the
fate
ordained
brief

wild
love
a
flight
of
poesy
and
then
a
shadow
fell
on
italy
thy
star
went
down
before
its
brightness
waned
yet
thou
hast
won
the
gift
tithonus
missed
never
to
feel
the
pain
of
growing
old
nor
lose
the
blissful
sight
of
beauty
truth
but
with
the
ardent
lips
that
music
kissed
to
breathe
thy
song
and
ere
thy
heart
grew
cold
become
the

the
quest
and
minstrel
of
the
unfulfilled

tuning
thy

immortal

the

thy

longfellow
in
a

land
a

land
a
land
full
of
labour
and
riches
and
confusion
where
there
were
many
running
to
and
fro
and
shouting
and
striving
together
in
the
midst
of
the
hurry
and
the
troubled
noise
i
heard
the
voice
of
one
singing
what
are
you
doing
there
o
man
singing
quietly
amid
all
this
tumult
this
is
the
time
for
new
inventions
mighty
shoutings
and
blowings
of
the
trumpet
but
he
answered
i
am
only
shepherding
my
sheep
with
music
so
he
went
along
his
chosen
way
keeping
his
little
flock
around
him
and
he
paused
to
listen
now
and
then
beside
the
antique
fountains
where
the
faces
of
forgotten
gods
were
refreshed
with
musically
falling
waters
or
he
sat
for
a
while
at
the
blacksmith
door
and
heard
the
of
the
anvils
or
he
rested
beneath
old
steeples
full
of
bells
that
showered
their
chimes
upon
him
or
he
walked
along
the
border
of
the
sea
ing
in
the
long
roar
of
the
billows
or
he
sunned
himself
in
the
yard
amid
the
tattoo
of
the
mallets
or
he
leaned
on
the
rail
of
the
bridge
letting
his
thoughts
flow
with
the
whispering
river
he
hearkened
also
to
ancient
tales
and
made
them
young
again
with
his
singing
then
a
flaming
arrow
of
death
fell
on
his
flock
and
pierced
the
heart
of
his
dearest
silent
the
music
now
as
the
shepherd
entered
the
mystical
temple
of
sorrow
long
he
tarried
in
darkness
there
but
when
he
came
out
he
was
singing
and
i
saw
the
faces
of
men
and
women
and
children
silently
turning
toward
him
the
youth
setting
out
on
the
journey
of
life
and
the
old
man
waiting
beside
the
last
the
toiler
sweating
beneath
his
load
and
the
happy
mother
rocking
her
cradle
the
lonely
sailor
on
seas
and
the
minded
scholar
in
his
the
bound
to
a
clacking
machine
and
the
hunter
in
the
forest
and
the
solitary
soul
hiding
friendless
in
the
wilderness
of
the
city
many
human
faces
full
of
care
and
longing
were
drawn
irresistibly
toward
him
by
the
charm
of
something
known
to
every
heart
yet
very
strange
and
lovely
and
at
the
sound
of
that
singing
wonderfully
all
their
faces
were
lightened
why
do
you
listen
o
you
people
to
this
old
and
music
this
is
not
for
you
in
the
splendour
of
a
new
age
in
the
democratic
triumph
listen
to
the
clashing
cymbals
the
big
drums
the
brazen
trumpets
of
your
poets
but
the
people
made
no
answer
following
in
their
hearts
the
simpler
music
for
it
seemed
to
them
nothing
could
be
better
worth
the
hearing
than
the
melodies
which
brought
sweet
order
into
life
confusion
so
the
shepherd
sang
his
way
along
until
he
came
unto
a
mountain
and
i
know
not
surely
whether
it
was
called
parnassus
but
he
climbed
it
out
of
sight
and
still
i
heard
the
voice
of
one
singing
thomas
bailey
aldrich
i
birthday
verses
dear
aldrich
now
november
mellow
days
have
brought
another
festa
round

memorial
sonnet
this
is
the
house
where
little
aldrich
read
the
early
pages
of
life
with
boyish
pleasure
in
this
he
watched
the
fire
of
fancy
spread
bright
colours
on
the
pictures
blue
and
red
he
skipped
the
longer
words
and
took
his
happy
way
with
searching
dreamful
look
among
the
deeper
things
more
simply
said
then
came
his
turn
to
write
and
still
the
flame
of
fancy
played
through
all
the
tales
he
told
and
still
he
won
the
laurelled
poet
fame
with
simple
words
wrought
into
rhymes
of
gold

face
to
which
this

the

lyrics
dramatic
and
personal
late
spring
i
ah
who
will
tell
me
in
these
leaden
days
why
the
sweet
spring
delays
and
where
she
hides
the
dear
desire
of
every
heart
that
longs
for
bloom
and
fragrance
and
the
ruby
fire
of
along
the
misty
hills
and
that
immortal
call
which
fills
the
waiting
wood
with
songs
the
came
so
long
ago
it
seemed
that
spring
was
near
but
then
returned
the
snow
with
biting
winds
and
all
the
earth
grew
sere
and
sullen
clouds
drooped
low
to
veil
the
sadness
of
a
hope
deferred
then
rain
rain
rain
incessant
rain
beat
on
the
through
which
i
watched
the
solitary
bird
that
braved
the
tempest
buffeted
and
tossed
with
rumpled
feathers
down
the
wind
again
oh
were
the
seeds
all
lost
when
winter
laid
the
wild
flowers
in
their
tomb
i
searched
their
haunts
in
vain
for
blue
hepaticas
and
trilliums
white
and
trailing
arbutus
the
spring
delight
starring
the
withered
leaves
with
rosy
bloom
the
woods
were
bare
and
every
night
the
frost
to
all
my
longings
spoke
a
silent
nay
and
told
me
spring
was
far
and
far
away
even
the
robins
were
too
cold
to
sing
except
a
broken
and
discouraged
note
only
the
tuneful
sparrow
on
whose
throat
music
has
put
her
triple
lifted
his
head
and
sang
my
heart
a
hint
wait
wait
wait
oh
wait
a
while
for
spring
ii
but
now
carina
what
divine
amends
for
all
delay
what
sweetness
treasured
up
what
wine
of
joy
that
blends
a
hundred
flavours
in
a
single
cup
is
poured
into
this
perfect
day
for
look
sweet
heart
here
are
the
early
flowers
that
lingered
on
their
way
thronging
in
haste
to
kiss
the
feet
of
may
and
mingled
with
the
bloom
of
later
hours
anemonies
and
violets
blue
and
white
and
iris
richly
gleaming
through
the
grasses
of
the
meadow
and
a
blaze
of
and
daisies
in
the
field
filling
the
air
with
praise
as
if
a
silver
chime
of
bells
had
pealed
the
frozen
songs
within
the
breast
of
silent
birds
that
hid
in
leafless
woods
melt
into
rippling
floods
of
gladness
unrepressed
now
oriole
and
thrush
and
lark
warbler
and
wren
and
vireo
confuse
their
music
for
the
living
spark
of
love
has
touched
the
fuel
of
desire
and
every
heart
leaps
up
in
singing
fire
it
seems
as
if
the
land
were
breathing
deep
beneath
the
sun
caress
trembling
with
tenderness
while
all
the
woods
expand
in
shimmering
clouds
of
rose
and
gold
and
green
to
veil
the
joys
too
sacred
to
be
seen
iii
come
put
your
hand
in
mine
true
love
long
sought
and
found
at
last
and
lead
me
deep
into
the
spring
divine
that
makes
amends
for
all
the
wintry
past
for
all
the
flowers
and
songs
i
feared
to
miss
arrive
with
you
and
in
the
lingering
pressure
of
your
kiss
my
dreams
come
true
and
in
the
promise
of
your
generous
eyes
i
read
the
mystic
sign
of
joy
more
perfect
made
because
so
long
delayed
and
bliss
enhanced
by
rapture
of
surprise
ah
think
not
early
love
alone
is
strong
he
loveth
best
whose
heart
has
learned
to
wait
dear
messenger
of
spring
that
tarried
long
you
doubly
dear
because
you
come
so
late
nepenthe
yes
it
was
like
you
to
forget
and
cancel
in
the
welcome
of
your
smile
my
deep
arrears
of
debt
and
with
the
putting
forth
of
both
your
hands
to
sweep
away
the
bars
my
folly
set
between
us
bitter
thoughts
and
harsh
mands
and
reckless
deeds
that
seemed
untrue
to
love
when
all
the
while
my
heart
was
aching
through
and
through
for
you
sweet
heart
and
only
you
yet
as
i
turned
to
come
to
you
again
i
thought
there
must
be
many
a
mile
of
sorrowful
reproach
to
cross
and
many
an
hour
of
mutual
pain
to
bear
until
i
could
make
plain
that
all
my
pride
was
but
the
fear
of
loss
and
all
my
doubt
the
shadow
of
despair
to
win
a
heart
so
innocent
and
fair
and
even
that
which
looked
most
ill
was
but
the
and
effort
vain
to
dull
the
thirst
which
you
alone
could
still
but
as
i
turned
the
desert
miles
were
crossed
and
when
i
came
the
weary
hours
were
sped
for
there
you
stood
beside
the
open
door
glad
gracious
smiling
as
before
and
with
bright
eyes
and
tender
hands
outspread
restored
me
to
the
eden
i
had
lost
never
a
word
of
cold
reproof
no
sharp
reproach
no
glances
that
accuse
the
culprit
whom
they
hold
aloof
ah
is
not
thus
that
other
women
use
the
power
they
have
won
for
there
is
none
like
you
beloved
none
secure
enough
to
do
what
you
have
done
where
did
you
learn
this
heavenly
art
you
sweetest
and
most
wise
of
all
that
live
with
silent
welcome
to
impart
assurance
of
the
royal
heart
that
never
questions
where
it
would
forgive
none
but
a
queen
could
pardon
me
like
this
my
sovereign
lady
let
me
lay
within
each
rosy
palm
a
loyal
kiss
of
penitence
then
close
the
fingers
up
thus
thus
now
give
the
cup
of
full
nepenthe
in
your
crimson
mouth
and
come
the
garden
blooms
with
bliss
the
wind
is
in
the
south
the
rose
of
love
with
dew
is
wet
dear
it
was
like
you
to
forget
hesper
her
eyes
are
like
the
evening
air
her
voice
is
like
a
rose
her
lips
are
like
a
lovely
song
that
ripples
as
it
flows
and
she
herself
is
sweeter
than
the
sweetest
thing
she
knows
a
slender
haunting
twilight
form
of
wonder
and
surprise
she
seemed
a
fairy
or
a
child
till
deep
within
her
eyes
i
saw
the
star
of
womanhood
arise
arrival
across
a
thousand
miles
of
sea
a
hundred
leagues
of
land
along
a
path
i
had
not
traced
and
could
not
understand
i
travelled
fast
and
far
for
this
to
take
thee
by
the
hand
a
pilgrim
knowing
not
the
shrine
where
he
would
bend
his
knee
a
mariner
without
a
dream
of
what
his
port
would
be
so
fared
i
with
a
seeking
heart
until
i
came
to
thee
o
cooler
than
a
grove
of
palm
in
some
place
o
fairer
than
an
isle
of
calm
after
the
wild
sea
race
the
quiet
room
adorned
with
flowers
where
first
i
saw
thy
face
then
furl
the
sail
let
fall
the
oar
forget
the
paths
of
foam
the
power
that
made
me
wander
far
at
last
has
brought
me
home
to
thee
dear
haven
of
my
heart
and
i
no
more
will
roam
departure
oh
why
are
you
shining
so
bright
big
sun
and
why
is
the
garden
so
gay
do
you
know
that
my
days
of
delight
are
done
do
you
know
i
am
going
away
if
you
covered
your
face
with
a
cloud
i
dream
you
were
sorry
for
me
in
my
pain
and
the
heads
of
the
flowers
all
bowed
would
seem
to
be
weeping
with
me
in
the
rain
but
why
is
your
head
so
low
sweet
heart
and
why
are
your
eyes
overcast
are
they
clouded
because
you
know
we
must
part
do
you
think
this
embrace
is
our
last
then
kiss
me
again
and
again
and
again
look
up
as
you
bid
me
for
your
face
is
too
dear
for
the
stain
of
a
tear
and
your
smile
is
the
sun
in
my
sky
the
black
birds
i
once
only
once
i
saw
it
clear
that
eden
every
human
heart
has
dreamed
a
hundred
times
but
always
far
away
ah
well
do
i
remember
how
it
seemed
through
the
still
atmosphere
of
that
enchanted
day
to
lie
wide
open
to
my
weary
feet
a
little
land
of
love
and
joy
and
rest
with
meadows
of
soft
green
rosy
with
cyclamen
and
sweet
with
delicate
breath
of
violets
unseen
and
tranquil
the
bloom
as
if
it
waited
for
a
coming
guest
a
little
house
of
peace
and
joy
and
love
was
nested
like
a
dove
from
the
rough
mountain
where
i
stood
homesick
for
happiness
only
a
narrow
valley
and
a
darkling
wood
to
cross
and
then
the
long
distress
of
solitude
would
be
forever
past
i
should
be
home
at
last
but
not
too
soon
oh
let
me
linger
here
and
feed
my
eyes
hungry
with
sorrow
on
all
this
loveliness
so
near
and
mine
then
from
the
wood
across
the
silvery
blue
a
dark
bird
flew
silent
with
sable
wings
close
in
his
wake
another
came
fragments
of
midnight
floating
through
the
sunset
flame
another
and
another
weaving
rings
of
blackness
on
the
primrose
sky
another
and
another
look
a
score
a
hundred
yes
a
thousand
rising
heavily
from
that
accursed
dumb
and
ancient
wood
they
boiled
into
the
lucid
air
like
smoke
from
some
deep
caldron
of
despair
and
more
and
more
and
ever
more
the
numberless
brood
flapping
their
ragged
plumes
possessed
the
landscape
and
the
evening
light
with
menaces
and
glooms
oh
dark
dark
dark
they
hovered
the
place
where
once
i
saw
the
little
house
so
white
amid
the
flowers
covering
every
trace
of
beauty
from
my
troubled
sight
and
suddenly
it
was
night
ii
at
break
of
day
i
crossed
the
wooded
vale
and
while
the
morning
made
a
trembling
light
among
the
pale
i
saw
the
sable
birds
on
every
limb
clinging
together
closely
in
the
shade
and
croaking
placidly
their
surly
hymn
but
oh
the
little
land
of
peace
and
love
that
those
wings
had
poised
above
where
was
it
gone
lost
lost
forevermore
only
a
cottage
dull
and
gray
in
the
cold
light
of
dawn
with
iron
bars
across
the
door
only
a
garden
where
the
withering
heads
of
flowers
presaging
decay
hung
over
barren
beds
only
a
desolate
field
that
lay
untilled
beneath
the
desolate
day
where
eden
seemed
to
bloom
i
found
but
these
so
wondering
i
passed
along
my
way
with
anger
in
my
heart
too
deep
for
words
against
that
grove
of
trees
and
the
black
magic
of
the
croaking
birds
without
disguise
if
i
have
erred
in
showing
all
my
heart
and
lost
your
favour
by
a
lack
of
pride
if
standing
like
a
beggar
at
your
side
with
naked
feet
i
have
forgot
the
art
of
those
who
bargain
well
in
passion
mart
and
win
the
thing
they
want
by
what
they
hide
be
mine
the
fault
as
mine
the
hope
denied
be
mine
the
lover
and
the
loser
part
the
sin
if
sin
it
was
i
do
repent
and
take
the
penance
on
myself
alone
yet
after
i
have
borne
the
punishment
i
shall
not
fear
to
stand
before
the
throne
of
love
with
open
heart
and
make
this
plea
at
least
i
have
not
lied
to
her
nor
thee
gratitude
do
you
give
thanks
for
this
or
that
no
god
be
thanked
i
am
not
grateful
in
that
cold
calculating
way
with
blessing
ranked
as
one
two
three
and
four
that
would
be
hateful
i
only
know
that
every
day
brings
good
above
my
poor
deserving
i
only
feel
that
in
the
road
of
life
true
love
is
leading
me
along
and
never
swerving
whatever
gifts
and
mercies
in
my
lot
may
fall
i
would
not
measure
as
worth
a
certain
price
in
praise
or
great
or
small
but
take
and
use
them
all
with
simple
pleasure
for
when
we
gladly
eat
our
daily
bread
we
bless
the
hand
that
feeds
us
and
when
we
tread
the
road
of
life
in
fulness
our
very
praise
the
love
that
leads
us
master
of
music
in
memory
of
theodore
thomas
glory
of
architect
glory
of
painter
and
tor
and
bard
living
forever
in
temple
and
picture
and
statue
and
song
look
how
the
world
with
the
lights
that
they
lit
is
illumined
and
starred
brief
was
the
flame
of
their
life
but
the
lamps
of
their
art
burn
long
where
is
the
master
of
music
and
how
has
he
vanished
away
where
is
the
work
that
he
wrought
with
his
wonderful
art
in
the
air
gone
it
is
gone
like
the
glow
on
the
cloud
at
the
close
of
the
day
the
master
has
finished
his
work
and
the
glory
of
music
is
where
once
at
the
wave
of
his
wand
all
the
billows
of
musical
sound
followed
his
will
as
the
sea
was
ruled
by
the
prophet
of
old
now
that
his
hand
is
relaxed
and
his
rod
has
dropped
to
the
ground
silent
and
dark
are
the
shores
where
the
vellous
harmonies
rolled
nay
but
not
silent
the
hearts
that
were
filled
by
that
sea
deeper
and
purer
forever
the
tides
of
their
being
will
roll
grateful
and
joyful
o
master
because
they
have
listened
to
thee
the
glory
of
music
endures
in
the
depths
of
the
human
soul
stars
and
the
soul
to
charles
a
young
astronomer
two
things
the
wise
man
said
fill
me
with
awe
the
starry
heavens
and
the
moral
law
nay
add
another
wonder
to
thy
roll
the
living
marvel
of
the
human
soul
born
in
the
dust
and
cradled
in
the
dark
it
feels
the
fire
of
an
immortal
spark
and
learns
to
read
with
patient
searching
eyes
the
splendid
secret
of

the
flower

we
lay
with
these
for
influence
sweeter
than
the
pleiades
to
julia
marlowe
reading
keats
ode
on
a
grecian
urn
long
had
i
loved
this
attic
shape
the
brede
of
marble
maidens
round
this
urn
divine
but
when
your
golden
voice
began
to
read
the
empty
urn
was
filled
with
chian
wine
pan
learns
music
lazy
god
stretched
on
the
rock
where
is
sweet
echo
and
where
is
your
flock
what
are
you
making
here
listen
said
pan
out
of
a
music
for
man
undine
was
far
away
and
long
ago
when
i
was
but
a
dreaming
boy
this
fairy
tale
of
love
and
woe
entranced
my
heart
with
tearful
joy
and
while
with
white
undine
i
wept
your
spirit
ah
how
strange
it
seems
was
cradled
in
some
star
and
slept
unconscious
of
her
coming
dreams
love
in
a
look
let
me
but
feel
thy
look
embrace
transparent
pure
and
warm
and
i
not
ask
to
touch
thy
face
or
fold
thee
with
mine
arm
for
in
thine
eyes
a
girl
doth
rise
arrayed
in
candid
bliss
and
draws
me
to
her
with
a
charm
more
close
than
any
kiss
a
of
golden
wine
songs
of
a
silver
brook
and
fragrant
breaths
of
eglantine
are
mingled
in
thy
look
more
fair
they
are
than
any
star
thy
topaz
eyes
divine
and
deep
within
their
thy
spirit
blends
with
mine
my
april
lady
when
down
the
stair
at
morning
the
sunbeams
round
her
float
sweet
rivulets
of
laughter
are
bubbling
in
her
throat
the
gladness
of
her
greeting
is
gold
without
alloy
and
in
the
morning
sunlight
i
think
her
name
is
joy
when
in
the
evening
twilight
the
quiet
lies
we
read
the
sad
old
ballads
while
from
her
hidden
eyes
the
tears
are
falling
falling
that
give
her
heart
relief
and
in
the
evening
twilight
i
think
her
name
is
grief
my
little
april
lady
of
sunshine
and
of
showers
she
weaves
the
old
spring
magic
and
breaks
my
heart
in
flowers
but
when
her
moods
are
ended
she
nestles
like
a
dove
then
by
the
pain
and
rapture
i
know
her
name
is
love
a
lover
envy
i
envy
every
flower
that
blows
along
the
meadow
where
she
goes
and
every
bird
that
sings
to
her
and
every
breeze
that
brings
to
her
the
fragrance
of
the
rose
i
envy
every
poet
rhyme
that
moves
her
heart
at
eventime
and
every
tree
that
wears
for
her
its
brightest
bloom
and
bears
for
her
the
fruitage
of
its
prime
i
envy
every
southern
night
that
paves
her
path
with
moonbeams
white
and
silvers
all
the
leaves
for
her
and
in
their
shadow
weaves
for
her
a
dream
of
dear
delight
i
envy
none
whose
love
requires
of
her
a
gift
a
task
that
tires
i
only
long
to
live
to
her
i
only
ask
to
give
to
her
all
that
her
heart
desires
the
hermit
thrush
o
wonderful
how
liquid
clear
the
molten
gold
of
that
ethereal
tone
floating
and
falling
through
the
wood
alone
a
poured
out
for
god
to
hear
o
holy
holy
holy
hyaline
long
light
low
light
glory
of
eventide
love
far
away
far
up
up
love
divine
little
love
too
for
ever
ever
near
warm
love
earth
love
tender
love
of
mine
in
the
leafy
dark
where
you
hide
you
are
mine
mine
mine
ah
my
beloved
do
you
feel
with
me
the
hidden
virtue
of
that
melody
the
rapture
and
the
purity
of
love
the
heavenly
joy
that
can
not
find
the
word
then
while
we
wait
again
to
hear
the
bird
come
very
near
to
me
and
do
not
move
now
hermit
of
the
woodland
fill
anew
the
cool
green
cup
of
air
with
harmony
and
we
will
drink
the
wine
of
love
with
you
city
like
a
long
arrow
through
the
dark
the
train
is
darting
bearing
me
far
away
after
a
perfect
day
of
love
delight
wakeful
with
all
the
memories
of
parting
i
lift
the
narrow
and
look
out
on
the
night
lonely
the
land
unknown
and
like
a
river
ing
forest
and
field
and
hill
are
gliding
backward
still
athwart
my
dream
till
in
that
country
strange
and
ever
stranger
growing
a
magic
city
full
of
lights
begins
to
glow
and
gleam
wide
through
the
landscape
dim
the
lamps
are
lit
in
millions
long
avenues
unfold
lines
of
gold
across
the
green
clusters
and
rings
of
light
and
luminous
vilions
oh
who
will
tell
the
city
name
and
what
these
wonders
mean
why
do
they
beckon
me
and
what
have
they
to
show
me
crowds
in
the
blazing
street
mirth
where
the
feasters
meet
kisses
and
wine
many
to
laugh
with
me
but
never
one
to
know
me
a
cityful
of
and
none
to
beat
with
mine
look
how
the
glittering
lines
are
wavering
and
lifting
softly
the
breeze
of

scatters
the

through
the

my

is
whirled
clear
in
your
dreams
of

the

again
in

days
she
trembles
with
her
wrath
and
swiftly
lays
thy
beauty
waste
in
wreck
and
agony
is
nature

a
strife
of
jealous
powers

the
plaything
of
unconscious

all
night
long
by
a
distant
bell
the
passing
hours
were
notched
on
the
dark
while
her
breathing
rose
and
fell
and
the
spark
of
life
i
watched
in
her
face
was
glowing
or
fading
who
could
tell
and
the
open
window
of
the
room
with
a
flare
of
yellow
light
was
peering
out
into
the
gloom
like
an
eye
that
searched
the
night
oh
what
do
you
see
in
the
dark
little
window
and
why
do
you
fear

see
that
the

little

ghosts
in

low
in

the
lurking
shadow
of
death
sweet
clear
notes
of

waking
bird
told
of
the
passing
away

dark

have
heard
for

smiled
in

rising

spoke
joy
without

word

the
splendor
born
in
the
east
outburned
the
yellow
lamplight
pale
and
thin
and
the
open
window
slowly
turned
to
the
eye
of
the
morning
looking
in
oh
what
do
you
see
in
the
room
little
window
that
makes
you
so
bright
i
see
that
a
child
is
asleep
on
her
pillow
soft
and
white
with
the
rose
of
life
on
her
lips

the

around

comes
with

along

alpine
dells
to
lead
the
cattle
forth
a
thousand
bells
go
chiming
after
her
across
the
fair
and
flowery
uplands
while
the
rosy
flare
of
sunset
on

dwells
and

darken

the
drowsy
spells
of
peace
are
woven
through

the
magic
of
this
hour
she
seems
to
walk
before
the
dark
by
falling
rills
and
lend
a
sweeter
song
to
hidden
streams
she
opens
all
the
doors

and
fills
with
moving
bells
the
music
of
my
dreams
that
wander
far
among

from

so
let
the

go
clean
out

we
think
of
braver
things
come
closer
in

my
friends
john
king
you
take
the
tiller
keep
her
head
you
philip
staffe
the
only
one
who
chose
freely
to
share
our
little
shallop
fate
rather
than
travel
in
the
ship
too
good
an
english
seaman
to
desert
these
crippled
comrades
try
to
make
them
rest
more
easy
on
the
thwarts
and
john
my
son
my
little
shipmate
come
and
lean
your
head
against
your
father
knee
do
you
recall
that
april
morn
in
ethelburga
church
five
years
ago
when
side
by
side
we
kneeled
to
take
the
sacrament
with
all
our
men
before
the
hopewell
left
catherine
docks
on
our
first
voyage
it
was
then
i
vowed
my
and
years
to
search
the
sea
until
we
found
the
that
leads
from
europe
into
asia
i
believe
that
god
has
poured
the
ocean
round
his
world
not
to
divide
but
to
unite
the
lands
and
all
the
english
captains
that
have
dared
in
little
ships
to
plough
uncharted
waves
davis
and
drake
hawkins
and
frobisher
raleigh
and
gilbert
all
the
other
names
are
written
in
the
chivalry
of
god
as
men
who
served
his
purpose
i
would
claim
a
place
among
that
knighthood
of
the
sea
and
i
have
earned
it
though
my
quest
should
fail
for
mark
me
well
the
honour
of
our
life
derives
from
this
to
have
a
certain
aim
before
us
always
which
our
will
must
seek
amid
the
peril
of
uncertain
ways
then
though
we
miss
the
goal
our
search
is
crowned
with
courage
and
we
find
along
our
path
a
rich
reward
of
unexpected
things
press
towards
the
aim
take
fortune
as
it
fares
i
know
not
why
but
something
in
my
heart
has
always
whispered
westward
seek
your
goal
three
times
they
sent
me
east
but
still
i
turned
the
bowsprit
west
and
felt
among
the
floes
of
ruttling
ice
along
the
groneland
coast
and
down
the
rugged
shore
of
newfoundland
and
past
the
rocky
capes
and
wooded
bays
where
gosnold
sailed
like
one
who
feels
his
way
with
outstretched
hand
across
a
darkened
room
i
groped
among
the
inlets
and
the
isles
to
find
the
passage
to
the
land
of
spice
i
have
not
found
it
yet
but
i
have
found
things
worth
the
finding
son
have
you
forgot
those
mellow
autumn
days
two
years
ago
when
first
we
sent
our
little
ship
the
flag
of
holland
floating
at
her
peak
across
a
sandy
bar
and
sounded
in
among
the
channels
to
a
goodly
bay
where
all
the
navies
of
the
world
could
ride
a
fertile
island
that
the
redmen
called
manhattan
lay
above
the
bay
the
land
around
was
bountiful
and
friendly
fair
but
never
land
was
fair
enough
to
hold
the
seaman
from
the
calling
of
the
sea
and
so
we
bore
to
westward
of
the
isle
along
a
mighty
inlet
where
the
tide
was
troubled
by
a
flood
that
seemed
to
come
from
far
away
perhaps
from
some
mysterious
gulf
of
tartary
inland
we
held
our
course
by
palisades
of
naked
rock
where
giants
might
have
built
their
fortress
and
by
rolling
hills
adorned
with
forests
rich
in
timber
for
great
ships
through
narrows
where
the
mountains
shut
us
in
with
frowning
cliffs
that
seemed
to
bar
the
stream
and
then
through
open
reaches
where
the
banks
sloped
to
the
water
gently
with
their
fields
of
corn
and
lentils
smiling
in
the
sun
ten
days
we
voyaged
through
that
placid
land
until
we
came
to
shoals
and
sent
a
boat
upstream
to
find
what
i
already
knew
we
travelled
on
a
river
not
a
strait
but
what
a
river
god
has
never
poured
a
stream
more
royal
through
a
land
more
rich
even
now
i
see
it
flowing
in
my
dream
while
coming
ages
people
it
with
men
of
manhood
equal
to
the
river
pride
i
see
the
wigwams
of
the
redmen
changed
to
ample
houses
and
the
tiny
plots
of
maize
and
green
tobacco
broadened
out
to
prosperous
farms
that
spread
hill
and
dale
the
mantle
of
their
crops
i
see
the
terraced
vineyard
on
the
slope
where
now
the
loops
its
tangled
vine
and
cattle
feeding
where
the
red
deer
roam
and
gathered
into
busy
hives
to
store
the
silver
comb
with
golden
sweet
and
all
the
promised
land
begins
to
flow
with
milk
and
honey
stately
manors
rise
along
the
banks
and
castles
top
the
hills
and
little
villages
grow
populous
with
trade
until
the
river
runs
as
proudly
as
the
rhine
the
thread
that
links
a
hundred
towns
and
towers
and
looking
deeper
in
my
dream
i
see
a
mighty
city
covering
the
isle
they
call
manhattan
equal
in
her
state
to
all
the
older
capitals
of
earth
the
gateway
city
of
a
golden
world
a
city
girt
with
masts
and
crowned
with
spires
and
swarming
with
a
host
of
busy
men
while
to
her
open
door
across
the
bay
the
ships
of
all
the
nations
flock
like
doves
my
name
will
be
remembered
there
for
men
will
say
this
river
and
this
isle
were
found
by
henry
hudson
on
his
way
to
seek
the
northwest
passage
into
farthest
inde
yes
yes
i
sought
it
then
i
seek
it
still
my
great
adventure
and
my
guiding
star
for
look
ye
friends
our
voyage
is
not
done
we
hold
by
hope
as
long
as
life
endures
somewhere
among
these
floating
fields
of
ice
somewhere
along
this
westward
widening
bay
somewhere
beneath
this
luminous
northern
night
the
channel
opens
to
the
orient
i
know
it
and
some
day
a
little
ship
will
push
her
bowsprit
in
and
battle
through
and
why
not
ours
who
can
tell
the
lucky
chance
awaits
the
fearless
heart
these
are
the
longest
days
of
all
the
year
the
world
is
round
and
god
is
everywhere
and
while
our
shallop
floats
we
still
can
steer
so
point
her
up
john
king
by
north
we
keep
the
honour
of
a
certain
aim
amid
the
peril
of
uncertain
ways
and
sail
ahead
and
leave
the
rest
to
god
