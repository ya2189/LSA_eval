poems
by
emily
dickinson
series
two
edited
by
two
of
her
friends
mabel
loomis
todd
and
preface
the
eagerness
with
which
the
first
volume
of
emily
poems
has
been
read
shows
very
clearly
that
all
our
alleged
modern
artificiality
does
not
prevent
a
prompt
appreciation
of
the
qualities
of
directness
and
simplicity
in
approaching
the
greatest
themes
life
and
love
and
death
that
irresistible
as
one
of
her
best
critics
has
called
it
piercing
at
once
the
very
core
of
a
thought
has
found
a
response
as
wide
and
sympathetic
as
it
has
been
unexpected
even
to
those
who
knew
best
her
compelling
power
this
second
volume
while
open
to
the
same
criticism
as
to
form
with
its
predecessor
shows
also
the
same
shining
beauties
although
emily
dickinson
had
been
in
the
habit
of
sending
occasional
poems
to
friends
and
correspondents
the
full
extent
of
her
writing
was
by
no
means
imagined
by
them
her
friend
must
at
least
have
suspected
it
for
in
a
letter
dated
september
she
wrote
my
dear
friend
what
portfolios
full
of
verses
you
must
have
it
is
a
cruel
wrong
to
your
day
and
generation
that
you
will
not
give
them
light
if
such
a
thing
should
happen
as
that
i
should
outlive
you
i
wish
you
would
make
me
your
literary
legatee
and
executor
surely
after
you
are
what
is
called
dead
you
will
be
willing
that
the
poor
ghosts
you
have
left
behind
should
be
cheered
and
pleased
by
your
verses
will
you
not
you
ought
to
be
i
do
not
think
we
have
a
right
to
withhold
from
the
world
a
word
or
a
thought
any
more
than
a
deed
which
might
help

the
portfolios
were
found
shortly
after
emily
dickinson
death
by
her
sister
and
only
surviving
housemate
most
of
the
poems
had
been
carefully
copied
on
sheets
of
and
tied
in
little
fascicules
each
of
six
or
eight
sheets
while
many
of
them
bear
evidence
of
having
been
thrown
off
at
white
heat
still
more
had
received
thoughtful
revision
there
is
the
frequent
addition
of
rather
perplexing
affording
large
choice
of
words
and
phrases
and
in
the
copies
which
she
sent
to
friends
sometimes
one
form
sometimes
another
is
found
to
have
been
used
without
important
exception
her
friends
have
generously
placed
at
the
disposal
of
the
editors
any
poems
they
had
received
from
her
and
these
have
given
the
obvious
advantage
of
comparison
among
several
renderings
of
the
same
verse
to
what
further
rigorous
pruning
her
verses
would
have
been
subjected
had
she
published
them
herself
we
can
not
know
they
should
be
regarded
in
many
cases
as
merely
the
first
strong
and
suggestive
sketches
of
an
artist
intended
to
be
embodied
at
some
time
in
the
finished
picture
emily
dickinson
appears
to
have
written
her
first
poems
in
the
winter
of
in
a
letter
to
one
of
the
present
editors
the
april
following
she
says
i
made
no
verse
but
one
or
two
until
this
winter
the
handwriting
was
at
first
somewhat
like
the
delicate
running
italian
hand
of
our
elder
gentlewomen
but
as
she
advanced
in
breadth
of
thought
it
grew
bolder
and
more
abrupt
until
in
her
latest
years
each
letter
stood
distinct
and
separate
from
its
fellows
in
most
of
her
poems
particularly
the
later
ones
everything
by
way
of
punctuation
was
discarded
except
numerous
dashes
and
all
important
words
began
with
capitals
the
effect
of
a
page
of
her
more
recent
manuscript
is
exceedingly
quaint
and
strong
the
given
in
the
present
volume
is
from
one
of
the
earlier
transition
periods
although
there
is
nowhere
a
date
the
handwriting
makes
it
possible
to
arrange
the
poems
with
general
chronologic
accuracy
as
a
rule
the
verses
were
without
titles
but
a
country
burial
a
the
and
a
few
others
were
named
by
their
author
frequently
at
the
end
sometimes
only
in
the
accompanying
note
if
sent
to
a
friend
the
variation
of
readings
with
the
fact
that
she
often
wrote
in
pencil
and
not
always
clearly
have
at
times
thrown
a
good
deal
of
responsibility
upon
her
editors
but
all
interference
not
absolutely
inevitable
has
been
avoided
the
very
roughness
of
her
rendering
is
part
of
herself
and
not
lightly
to
be
touched
for
it
seems
in
many
cases
that
she
intentionally
avoided
the
smoother
and
more
usual
rhymes
like
impressionist
pictures
or
wagner
rugged
music
the
very
absence
of
conventional
form
challenges
attention
in
emily
dickinson
exacting
hands
the
especial
intrinsic
fitness
of
a
particular
order
of
words
might
not
be
sacrificed
to
anything
virtually
extrinsic
and
her
verses
all
show
a
strange
cadence
of
inner
rhythmical
music
lines
are
always
daringly
constructed
and
the
appears
frequently
appealing
indeed
to
an
unrecognized
sense
more
elusive
than
hearing
emily
dickinson
scrutinized
everything
with
frankness
every
subject
was
proper
ground
for
legitimate
study
even
the
sombre
facts
of
death
and
burial
and
the
unknown
life
beyond
she
touches
these
themes
sometimes
lightly
sometimes
almost
humorously
more
often
with
weird
and
peculiar
power
but
she
is
never
by
any
chance
frivolous
or
trivial
and
while
as
one
critic
has
said
she
may
exhibit
toward
god
an
emersonian
it
was
because
she
looked
upon
all
life
with
a
candor
as
unprejudiced
as
it
is
rare
she
had
tried
society
and
the
world
and
found
them
lacking
she
was
not
an
invalid
and
she
lived
in
seclusion
from
no
her
life
was
the
normal
blossoming
of
a
nature
introspective
to
a
high
degree
whose
best
thought
could
not
exist
in
pretence
storm
wind
the
wild
march
sky
sunsets
and
dawns
the
birds
and
bees
butterflies
and
flowers
of
her
garden
with
a
few
trusted
human
friends
were
sufficient
companionship
the
coming
of
the
first
robin
was
a
jubilee
beyond
crowning
of
monarch
or
birthday
of
pope
the
first
red
leaf
hurrying
through
the
altered
air
an
epoch
immortality
was
close
about
her
and
while
never
morbid
or
melancholy
she
lived
in
its
presence

my
nosegays
are
for
captives
dim
eyes
fingers
denied
the
plucking
patient
till
paradise
to
such
if
they
should
whisper
of
morning
and
the
moor
they
bear
no
other
errand
and
i
no
other
prayer
i
life
i
nobody
who
are
you
are
you
nobody
too
then
there
a
pair
of
us
do
tell
they
banish
us
you
know
how
dreary
to
be
somebody
how
public
like
a
frog
to
tell
your
name
the
livelong
day
to
an
admiring
bog
ii
i
bring
an
unaccustomed
wine
to
lips
long
parching
next
to
mine
and
summon
them
to
drink
crackling
with
fever
they
essay
i
turn
my
brimming
eyes
away
and
come
next
hour
to
look
the
hands
still
hug
the
tardy
glass
the
lips
i
would
have
cooled
alas
are
so
superfluous
cold
i
would
as
soon
attempt
to
warm
the
bosoms
where
the
frost
has
lain
ages
beneath
the
mould
some
other
thirsty
there
may
be
to
whom
this
would
have
pointed
me
had
it
remained
to
speak
and
so
i
always
bear
the
cup
if
haply
mine
may
be
the
drop
some
pilgrim
thirst
to
slake
if
haply
any
say
to
me
unto
the
little
unto
me
when
i
at
last
awake
iii
the
nearest
dream
recedes
unrealized
the
heaven
we
chase
like
the
june
bee
before
the
invites
the
race
stoops
to
an
easy
clover
dips
evades
teases
deploys
then
to
the
royal
clouds
lifts
his
light
pinnace
heedless
of
the
boy
staring
bewildered
at
the
mocking
sky
homesick
for
steadfast
honey
ah
the
bee
flies
not
that
brews
that
rare
variety
iv
we
play
at
paste
till
qualified
for
pearl
then
drop
the
paste
and
deem
ourself
a
fool
the
shapes
though
were
similar
and
our
new
hands
learned
practising
sands
i
found
the
phrase
to
every
thought
i
ever
had
but
one
and
that
defies
me
as
a
hand
did
try
to
chalk
the
sun
to
races
nurtured
in
the
dark
how
would
your
own
begin
can
blaze
be
done
in
cochineal
or
noon
in
mazarin
vi
hope
hope
is
the
thing
with
feathers
that
perches
in
the
soul
and
sings
the
tune
without
the
words
and
never
stops
at
all
and
sweetest
in
the
gale
is
heard
and
sore
must
be
the
storm
that
could
abash
the
little
bird
that
kept
so
many
warm
i
heard
it
in
the
chillest
land
and
on
the
strangest
sea
yet
never
in
extremity
it
asked
a
crumb
of
me
vii
the
white
heat
dare
you
see
a
soul
at
the
white
heat
then
crouch
within
the
door
red
is
the
fire
common
tint
but
when
the
vivid
ore
has
sated
flame
conditions
its
quivering
substance
plays
without
a
color
but
the
light
of
unanointed
blaze
least
village
boasts
its
blacksmith
whose
anvil
even
din
stands
symbol
for
the
finer
forge
that
soundless
tugs
within
refining
these
impatient
ores
with
hammer
and
with
blaze
until
the
designated
light
repudiate
the
forge
viii
triumphant
who
never
lost
are
unprepared
a
coronet
to
find
who
never
thirsted
flagons
and
cooling
tamarind
who
never
climbed
the
weary
league
can
such
a
foot
explore
the
purple
territories
on
pizarro
shore
how
many
legions
overcome
the
emperor
will
say
how
many
colors
taken
on
revolution
day
how
many
bullets
bearest
the
royal
scar
hast
thou

write
promoted
on
this
soldier
brow
ix
the
test
i
can
wade
grief
whole
pools
of
it
i
used
to
that
but
the
least
push
of
joy
breaks
up
my
feet
and
i
tip
drunken
let
no
pebble
smile
was
the
new
liquor
that
was
all
power
is
only
pain
stranded
through
discipline
till
weights
will
hang
give
balm
to
giants
and
they
wilt
like
men
give
himmaleh
they
carry
him
x
escape
i
never
hear
the
word
escape
without
a
quicker
blood
a
sudden
expectation
a
flying
attitude
i
never
hear
of
prisons
broad
by
soldiers
battered
down
but
i
tug
childish
at
my
bars
only
to
fail
again
xi
compensation
for
each
ecstatic
instant
we
must
an
anguish
pay
in
keen
and
quivering
ratio
to
the
ecstasy
for
each
beloved
hour
sharp
pittances
of
years
bitter
contested
farthings
and
coffers
heaped
with
tears
xii
the
martyrs
through
the
straight
pass
of
suffering
the
martyrs
even
trod
their
feet
upon
temptation
their
faces
upon
god
a
stately
shriven
company
convulsion
playing
round
harmless
as
streaks
of
meteor
upon
a
planet
bound
their
faith
the
everlasting
troth
their
expectation
fair
the
needle
to
the
north
degree
wades
so
through
polar
air
xiii
a
prayer
i
meant
to
have
but
modest
needs
such
as
content
and
heaven
within
my
income
these
could
lie
and
life
and
i
keep
even
but
since
the
last
included
both
it
would
suffice
my
prayer
but
just
for
one
to
stipulate
and
grace
would
grant
the
pair
and
so
upon
this
wise
i
prayed
great
spirit
give
to
me
a
heaven
not
so
large
as
yours
but
large
enough
for
me
a
smile
suffused
jehovah
face
the
cherubim
withdrew
grave
saints
stole
out
to
look
at
me
and
showed
their
dimples
too
i
left
the
place
with
all
my
might
my
prayer
away
i
threw
the
quiet
ages
picked
it
up
and
judgment
twinkled
too
that
one
so
honest
be
extant
as
take
the
tale
for
true
that
whatsoever
you
shall
ask
itself
be
given
you
but
i
grown
shrewder
scan
the
skies
with
a
suspicious
air
as
children
swindled
for
the
first
all
swindlers

the

beneath
so
slight
a
film

more

seen
as

xv
the
soul
unto
itself
is
an
imperial
friend
or
the
most
agonizing
spy
an
enemy
could
send
secure
against
its
own
no
treason
it
can
fear
itself
its
sovereign
of
itself
the
soul
should
stand
in
awe

the
railway
train
i
like
to
see
it
lap
the
miles
and
lick
the
valleys
up
and
stop
to
feed
itself
at
tanks
and
then
prodigious
step
around
a
pile
of
mountains
and
supercilious
peer
in
shanties
by
the
sides
of
roads
and
then
a
quarry
pare
to
fit
its
sides
and
crawl
between
complaining
all
the
while
in
horrid
hooting
stanza
then
chase
itself
down
hill
and
neigh
like
boanerges
then
punctual
as
a
star
stop
docile
and
omnipotent
at
its
own
stable
door

show

delight
becomes
pictorial
when
viewed
through
pain
more
fair
because
impossible

a
thought
went
up
my
mind
that
i
have
had
before
but
did
not
finish
some
way
back
i
could
not
fix
the
year
nor
where
it
went
nor
why
it
came
the
second
time
to
me
nor
definitely
what
it
was
have
i
the
art
to
say
but
somewhere
in
my
soul
i
know
i
met
the
thing
before
it
just
reminded
me
was
all
and
came
my
way
no
more

is

physician
they
say
that
he
can
heal
but
medicine

unavailable
is
heaven
an
exchequer

speak
of
what
we
owe
but

negotiation
i
not

party

xxii
the
return
though
i
get
home
how
late
how
late
so

get
home

compensate

be
the
ecstasy
that
they
have
done
expecting
me
when
night
descending
dumb
and
dark
they
hear
my
unexpected
knock
transporting
must
the
moment
be
brewed
from
decades
of
agony
to
think
just
how
the
fire
will
burn
just
how
eyes
will
turn
to
wonder
what
myself
will
say
and
what
itself
will
say

me

a
poor
torn
heart
a
tattered
heart
that
sat
it
down
to
rest
nor
noticed
that
the
ebbing
day
flowed
silver
to
the
west
nor
noticed
night
did
soft
descend
nor
constellation
burn
intent
upon
the
vision
of
latitudes
unknown
the
angels
happening
that
way
this
dusty
heart
espied
tenderly
took
it
up
from
toil
and
carried
it
to

barefoot

drew
the

i
could
not

felt
ill

odd
as

scanned

like
an
ocean

broke
against

a
wooden
laugh

i
could
fear
a
door
who
danger
and
the
dead
had
faced

never
quaked
before

fitted
to
the
latch
my
hand
with
trembling
care
lest
back
the
awful
door
should
spring
and
leave
me
standing
there

off

cautiously

out
tell

hurried
then
how

waded
slow
slow
slow

then
you
wished
you
had

in

so
you
could
see
what
moved
them
so
tell

it
was

you
guessed

the

toiled
you
could
hear
the
bodice
tug
behind
you
as
if
it
held
but
the
might
of
a
child
you
almost
pitied
it
you
it
worked
so
tell
him
no
you
may
quibble
there
for
it
would
split
his
heart
to
know
it
and
then
you
and
i
were
silenter
tell
him

finished
before
we
finished
and
the

kept
neighing
and
you
got

begged
to
be

could
it
hinder
so
to
say
tell
him
just
how

sealed
you

if
he
ask
where
you
are
hid

i
lock

push
it
with

next
for
transport
it
be

then
i
go
the
furthest
off
to
counteract
a
knock
then
draw
my

forth
and
softly
pick
its
lock
then
glancing
narrow
at
the
wall
and
narrow
at
the
floor
for
firm
conviction
of
a
mouse
not
exorcised
before
peruse
how
infinite

strives
with

each

leads
her
daisies
back
recording
briefly
lost
but
when
the
south
wind
stirs
the
pools
and
struggles
in
the
lanes
her
heart
misgives
her
for
her
vow

she
pours
soft
refrains
into
the
lap
of
adamant

the
dew
that
stiffens
quietly
to

i

no

my
best
was
gone
to
sleep

morn
a
new
politeness
took
and
failed
to
wake
them
up
but
called
the
others
clear
and
passed
their
curtains
by
sweet
morning
when
i
knock
recollect
for
me
i
looked
at
sunrise
once
and
then
i
looked
at
them
and
wishfulness
in
me
arose
for
circumstance
the

was
such
an
ample
peace
it
could
not
hold
a
sigh
was

with
the
bells
divorced
was
sunset
all
the
day
so
choosing
but
a
gown
and
taking
but
a
prayer
the
only
raiment
i
should
need
i
struggled
and
was
there
xxi
if
anybody
friend
be
dead
it
sharpest
of
the
theme
the
thinking
how
they
walked
alive
at
such
and
such
a
time
their
costume
of
a
sunday
some
manner
of
the
hair
a
prank
nobody
knew
but
them
lost
in
the
sepulchre
how
warm
they
were
on
such
a
day
you
almost
feel
the
date
so
short
way
off
it
seems
and
now
they
centuries
from
that
how
pleased
they
were
at
what
you
said
you
try
to
touch
the
smile
and
dip
your
fingers
in
the
frost
when
was
it
can
you
tell
you
asked
the
company
to
tea
acquaintance
just
a
few
and
chatted
close
with
this
grand
thing
that
do
remember
you
past
bows
and
invitations
past
interview
and
vow
past
what
ourselves
can
estimate
that
makes
the
quick
of

the

our
journey

advanced
our
feet
were
almost
come
to
that
odd
fork
in

eternity
by

our
pace
took
sudden
awe
our
feet
reluctant
led
before
were

between
the
forest
of
the

retreat
was
out
of

behind
a

going
on
such
a
night

such
a
night
would
anybody
care
if
such
a
little
figure
slipped
quiet
from
its
chair
so
quiet
oh
how
quiet
that
nobody
might
know
but
that
the
little
figure
rocked
softer
to
and

on
such
a
dawn
or
such
a
dawn
would
anybody
sigh
that
such
a
little
figure
too
sound
asleep
did
lie
for
chanticleer
to
wake
it
or
stirring
house
below
or
giddy
bird
in
orchard
or
early
task
to
do
there
was
a
little
figure
plump
for
every
little
knoll
busy
needles
and
spools
of
thread
and
trudging
feet
from
school
playmates
and
holidays
and
nuts
and
visions
vast
and
small
strange
that
the
feet
so
precious
charged
should
reach
so
small

on

sweet
to
know
that

stand
when

with

lie
that

continue

briskly
fly
it
makes
the
parting
tranquil

keeps
the
soul
serene

the

at
length
her
final
summer
was
it
and
yet
we
guessed
it
not

tenderer
industriousness
pervaded
her
we
thought
a
further
force
of
life
developed
from
within
when
death
lit
all
the
shortness
up
and
made
the

plain
we
wondered
at
our
blindness
when
nothing
was
to

her
carrara

for

keep

yet
it
tasted
like
them
all
the
figures
i
have
seen
set
orderly
for
burial
reminded
me
of
mine
as
if
my
life
were
shaven
and
fitted
to
a
frame
and
could
not
breathe
without
a
key
and
was
like
midnight
some
when
everything
that
ticked
has
stopped
and
space
stares
all
around
or
grisly
frosts

autumn
morns
repeal
the
beating
ground

most
like
chaos
stopless
cool
without

even
a
report
of

to
justify
despair
xxxvi
till
the
end
i
should
not
dare
to
leave
my
friend

because
if
he
should
die
while
i
was
gone

i
too
late
should
reach
the
heart

wanted
me

i
should
disappoint
the
eyes
that
hunted

so
to
see

could
not
bear
to
shut
until

noticed
me
