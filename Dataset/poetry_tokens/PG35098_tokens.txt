a

as
a
pale
child
hemmed
in
by
windy
rain
patiently
turns
to
touch
his
toys
playing
as
children
play
who
make
no
noise
yet
happy
in
a
way

sighs
again
to
watch
the
world
across
the
pane
and
sees
with
wistful
eyes
glad
girls
and
boys
who
romp
beneath
the
rain
unlicensed
joys
and
feels
wild
longings
sweep
his
gentle
brain
so
i
contented
with
my
flowers
for
stars
stroll
in
my
fair
walled
garden
happily
knowing
no
gladder
game
till
shrill
and
sweet
i
hear
life
cry
ring
down
the
silent
street
and
press
my
face
against
the
sunlit
bars
to
watch
the
joyous
spirits
who
are
free

but
light
and
laughter

tears

the
sunlight
of
my
fairest
years
by
love
made
desolate
by
love
beguiled
i
waste
the
spring
love
harvest
wains
are
piled
with
poppies
and
gold
grain
i
glean
but
fears
of
empty
hands
grim
hunger
and
the
jeers
of
happy
wives
whose
loves
are
reconciled
but
mine
ah
mine
is
like
a
tattered
leaf
upon
a
turbid
stream
i
have
no
pride
no
life
but
love
which
is
a
bitter
grief
as
a
lost
star
i
wander
down
your
sky
give
me
your
heart
open
it
wide
so
wide
i
must
have
love
and
laughter
or
i
die
v
upon
your
stone
the
wine
of
my
desire
is
spilled
your
poppy
lips
have
grown
too
pale
from
fasting
your
white
hands
will
not
avail
the
cold
eyes
of
your
heart
to
light
the
fire
i
did
not
think
my
prayers
could
ever
tire
now
like
doomed
ships
they
flutter
without
sail
lost
in
a
calm
which
held
no
rock
no
gale
now
when
your
chilly
smile
bids
me
aspire
so
without
history
my
soul
is
slain
woman
of
barren
love
the
wine
was
red
beautiful
for
your
spending
not
again
will
the
bud
blossom
where
the
frost
has
sped
timid
you
dared
not
hark
when
angels
sang
all
all
is
lost
without
one
saving
pang

supreme
better
than
life
better
than
sea
and
morn
and
all
the
fragments
of
the
day
ah
more
than

than
purple
clouds
that
stray
across
dim
twilights
i
the
fighting
the
stars
for
glory
who
must
scorn
bespread
along

cruel

scattered
petals
on

breast

better
than

i
love
you
i
forlorn
better
than
death
the
sleeping
and
the
peace
when
warm
within
the
breast
of
brooding
earth
my
weary
heart
should
give
its
woes
release
the
pitiful
dark
remembering
not
my
loss
the
calm
wise
years
restoring
joy
for
dearth
better
than
death
my
love
my
burning
cross
vii
out
of
the
purple
treasuries
of
night
came
the
dark
wind
of
evening
stirred
on
his
cheek
the
forest
keeping
ward
breathed
with
a
tremulous
silence
and
the
bright
bare
moon
crowned
his
adoring
brow
with
light
the
exquisite
dream
of
beauty
held
him
hard
in
a
great
love
a
forest
love
unmarred
still
unprofaned
by
human
nature
sight
guarding
the
temple
gates
of
peace
he
stood
statue
of
bronze
with
pagan
heart
of
stone
sudden
a
dazzling
glory
lit
the
wood
moon
in
his
soul
that
dimmed
the
moon
above
life
was
revealed
a
maid
alone
beauty
was
woman
and
the
woman
love
viii
as
one
who
looks
too
long
upon
the
sun
when
he
must
turn
to
earth
from
skies
sees
all
else
dark
through
his
bereaved
eyes
and
yet
may
watch
the
rainbow
ribbons
run
athwart
the
gravity
of
gray
and
dun
he
holds
the
darkness
dearer
for
the
prize
wherein
his
only
pledge
of
radiance
lies
when
he
the
vast
magnificence
must
shun
so
we
who
play
with
rainbows
having
seen
the
sun
own
face
we
may
not
hold
the
west
which
burns
against
the
bosom
of
the
night
but
in
the
with
eyes
serene
we
still
may
find
dear
heart
the
sun
bequest
an
echoed
glory
of
our
passionate
light
ix
we
would
live
how
we
would
live
we
drink
the
years
like
wine
with
all
hid
behind
the
veil
which
is
your
hair
between
two
lilies
pale
your
slender
hands
my
heart
should
lie
and
shine
a
crimson
rose
we
catch
the
wind
and
twine
the
evening
stars
a
chaplet
musical
to
crown
our
folly
lure
the
nightingale
to
sing
the
bliss
your
lips
should
teach
to
mine
and
if
the
sage
declaring
life
is
vain
should
frown
upon
the
flower
of
all
our
days
and
chide
the
sun
that
knows
no
tears
of
rain
he
should
not
tease
our
heart
with
cynic
eye
the
soul
vast
altar
stands
beyond
his
gaze
when
two
have
lived
then
shall
they
fear
to
die
x
nay
touch
me
not
nor
even
with
your
eyes
hold
mine
for
i
would
speak
you
thus
afar
aloof
and
chill
and
lonely
as
a
star
the
hands
that
urge
the
hungry
heart
that
cries
have
wrapped
my
love
with
love
elusive
lies
the
lips
that
burn
have
laid
a
ruddy
scar
against
the
truth
that
stands
without
the
bar
and
blinded
faith
with
passion
mysteries
night
holds
a
single
moon
day
one
desire
her
golden
sun
and
life
a
love
supreme
wherein
one
moment
poises
crowned
with
fire
white
with
the
naked
truth
beyond
control
is
here
my
sun
in
love
last
hour
extreme
i
hold
aloft
my
bare
adoring
soul
xi
if
i
might
see
you
dead
beloved
dead
your
false
eyes
closed
forever
to
the
light
your
false
smile
stilled
upon
my
aching
sight
if
i
might
know
that
nevermore
your
head
cruelly
fair
could
lie
upon
the
bed
of
my
torn
heart
if
i
beheld
the
night
free
from
your
living
thought
ah
if
i
might
then
could
my
desolate
soul
be
comforted
for
this
is
worst
of
all
the
woes
you
gave
my
heart
may
not
forgive
the
tired
years
go
and
leave
the
great
love
weeping
for
a
grave
scorned
and
unburied
the
open
sky
i
could
not
love
you
less
to
see
you
so
loving
you
more
i
might
forgive
and
die
xii
dear
did
we
meet
in
some
dim
yesterday
i
half
remember
how
the
birds
were
mute
among
green
leaves
and
fruit
and
on
the
grass
beside
a
stream
we
lay
in
early
twilight
faintly
far
away
came
lovely
sounds
adrift
from
silver
lute
with
answered
echoes
of
an
airy
flute
while
twilight
waited
tiptoe
fain
to
stay
her
violet
eyes
were
sweet
with
mystery
you
looked
in
mine
the
music
rose
and
fell
like
little
lisping
laughter
of
the
sea
our
souls
were
barks
from
the
shore
gold
cup
a
rose
a
ruby
who
can
tell
soft
music
ceases
i
recall
no
more
xiii
and
i
died
and
yet
upon
my
eyes
a
glamour
of
the
gorgeous
summer
green
still
wavers
and
my
brain
has
kept
a
keen
sweet
glad
with
light
the
summer
skies
are
sapphire
and
a
purple
shadow
lies
across
the
hills
no
change
is
on
the
scene
since
happy
yesterday
ah
can
it
mean
the
body
lives
when
stricken
spirit
dies
the
blow
has
fallen
yet
i
can
recall
the
first
of
days
when
this
dead
heart
drew
breath
a
wondrous
waking
of
a
heart
strange
then
as
now
the
moment
seemed
to
part
body
from
soul
so
like
are
birth
and
death
so
did
i
gain
and
so
i
lost
my
all
xiv
of
the
lights
within
the
are
our
flowers
lily
and
daffodil
and
violet
beneath
these
monstrous
suns
that
never
set
tremble
soft
rainbows
young
as
earth
first
hours
ancient
as
time
no
balm
of
gentle
showers
make
for
their
growth
for
them
gigantic
met
the
immemorial
ice
and
sun
to
get
such
blossoms
pledge
of
beauty
bravest
powers
violet
and
pale
the
dies
in
the
soft
south
to
us
in
this
grim
world
daring
with
frozen
heart
and
tearless
eyes
the
north
white
sanctity
fate
idly
throws
these
alms
a
deathless
spring
of
ice
enfurled
and
over
all
far
flung
the
sunset
rose
xv
and
i
can
believe
that
my
beloved
dies
that
all
her
virtue
all
her
youth
shall
fail
and
life
her
rosy
life
grow
cold
and
pale
to
bloom
again
in
braver
paradise
i
must
believe
that
death
shall
close
her
eyes
and
hold
her
heart
beyond
a
heavy
veil
where
silences
surround
her
spirit
frail
and
waste
the
form
where
all
my
loving
lies
ah
god
but
no
and
is
my
love
so
weak
her
heart
may
pause
may
falter
and
grow
still
but
not
her
laugh
the
color
in
her
cheek
that
may
not
fade
the
catch
that
lifts
her
breath
sobbing
against
my
heart
essay
your
will
these
are
too
dear
to
fill
grave
o
death
xvi
when
one
has
heard
the
message
of
the
rose
for
what
faint
other
calling
shall
he
care
dark
broodings
turn
to
find
their
lonely
lair
the
vain
world
keeps
her
posturing
and
pose
he
with
his
crimson
secret
which
bestows
heaven
on
his
heart
to
heaven
lifts
his
prayer
and
knows
all
glory
trembling
through
the
air
as
on
triumphal
journeying
he
goes
so
through
green
woodlands
in
the
twilight
dim
led
by
the
faint
pale
argent
of
a
star
what
though
to
others
it
is
weary
night
nature
holds
out
her
wide
sweet
heart
to
him
and
leaning
the
world
mysterious
bar
his
soul
is
great
with
everlasting
light
xvii
and
first
came
the
tempest
and
the
world
was
torn
upon
its
mighty
passion
all
the
deep
trembled
before
it
from
the
haggard
steep
to
the
sweet
valley
with
its
brooding
corn
its
foaming
lips
in
expletives
of
scorn
lashed
into
life
the
world
eternal
sleep
then
caught
with
madness
in
gigantic
leap
expired
upon
the
heights
where
it
was
born
and
then
a
hush
the
dripping
tender
rain
falls
in
warm
tears
the
thunder
could
not
wake
the
grief
that
silence
in
her
soul
has
furled
soft
sighs
the
wind
the
sea
is
gray
with
pain
the
fulness
of
a
heart
too
tense
to
break
and
deep
unuttered
sadness
in
the
world
xviii
the
country
road
at
lonely
close
of
day
rests
for
a
while
from
the
long
stress
of
rain
dripping
and
bowed
the
green
walls
of
the
lane
reflect
no
glistening
light
no
colors
gay
has
dying
summer
left
the
sky
is
gray
as
though
the
weeping
had
not
eased
the
pain
the
autumn
is
not
yet
and
all
in
vain
seems
summer
life
a
blossom
cast
away
the
air
is
hushed
save
in
the
emerald
shade
the
rain
still
drips
and
stirs
each
fretting
leaf
to
soft
insistence
of
its
little
grief
the
hopeless
calm
all
thought
of
life
denies
but
hark
out
through
the
silence
unafraid
a
robin
ripples
to
the
chilly
skies
xix
through
this
not
through
this
door
of
elemental
calm
patient
wet
woodland
resting
after
rain
brooding
brown
fields
that
wait
the
sleeping
grain
not
through
this
door
may
the
wrecked
spirit
balm
come
in
and
take
possession
there
a
psalm
nature
has
crooned
to
weariness
and
pain
easing
the
tumult
of
the
brain
sweet
wholesome
mother
of
the
open
palm
but
the
disastrous
heart
cries
out
for
men
strife
where
the
fight
is
reddest
verily
peace
comes
with
fighting
with
the
strength
of
ten
here
where
the
world
is
young
with
naught
to
see
but
day
blow
out
across
the
long
low
sky
peace
means
an
emptiness
which
rests
to
die
xx
all
my
dead
roses
now
i
lay
them
here
shrined
in
a
beryl
cup
the
mysteries
of
their
sweet
hauntings
and
their
witcheries
are
not
more
subtle
than
this
jewel
clear
are
not
more
cold
and
dead
the
winter
spear
has
fallen
on
their
heart
a
heart
so
wise
with
lore
of
love
dead
roses
beauty
lies
hid
in
a
perfume
still

dear
roses

love
time
killed
you
one
by
one
laughed
at
my
pains
as
sad
i
gathered
up
all
the
fair
petals
banished
from
the
sun
witness
my
triumph
how
the
dead
loves
bless
life
from
my
heart
which
is
their
beryl
cup
crowning
the
winter
of
my
loneliness
xxi
how
shall
i
hold
you
by
a
scimitar
of
flashing
wit
suspended
your
head
oh
my
beloved
or
with
lips
lure
you
to
lethe
shall
i
stand
afar
pale
and
remote
and
distant
as
a
star
challenging
love
or
by
a
scarlet
thread
jealousy
wiles
beguile
by
scorn
and
dread
wounding
the
heart
i
love
with
hateful
scar
nay
i
can
take
no
action
play
no
play
all
my
wit
falters
when
i
hear
you
speak
all
my
wise
guile
with
which
your
wooing
strove
vanishes
as
the
sun
of
yesterday
i
can
but
lay
my
cheek
against
your
cheek
love
me
or
leave
me
i
can
only
love
xxii
a
take
all
of
me
pour
out
my
life
as
wine
to
dye
your
soul
sweet
shallows
violent
sin
blazed
me
a
path
and
i
have
walked
therein
strong
unashamed
your
timorous
hands
need
mine
as
the
white
stars
their
sky
your
lips
pale
line
shall
blush
to
roses
where
my
lips
have
been
i
ask
no
more
i
do
not
hope
to
win
only
to
add
myself
to
your
design

all
of

little
lies
your
light
dishonor
gentle
treacheries

me
and

my
adoring
to
your
honor
sweet
strength
for
your
weakness
it
is

the
pale
and

flitting

again
gleaming
of
golden
and

what
is
the

you
spring
from

where
butterflies
daintily
poise

disclose
whence

you

is

me
the

opened
her

jewels

the

dancing
with

the

blue
of
mysterious

of
green
and
the
grass
lifts
up
its
hands
to
the
summer
hiding
insidious
serpents
fair
as
the
sweets
that
are
sin
jewels
more
bright
than

fall
from

who

you
came

aside
not

your

your

a
song
murmurs
ever
in
hopeless
refrain

i
wake
in
the
night
with
my
empty

yearning
in
vain
for
the
touch
of
your
hair
you
went

triumphed

crushed
out
my

are
ashen
forgetting

wonderful
bliss

never

the
ghost

our
passion
stands
white

the
song

they
made
their

the
cord
bit

the
song
the
pagan
lovers
heard
wakened
by
flowers
in
a
dawn
through
the
bright
dew
they
fled
like
ocean
stirred
with
morning
bare
