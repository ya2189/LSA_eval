introduction
the
verses
in
this
volume
cover
very
many
and
various
occasions
and
are
therefore
the
very
contrary
of
what
is
commonly
called
occasional
verse
the
term
is
used
with
a
meaning
that
is
very
mutable
or
with
a
meaning
that
has
been
greatly
distorted
and
degraded
occasion
should
mean
opportunity
and
in
the
case
of
poetry
it
should
rather
mean
provocation
and
the
trick
of
writing
upon
what
are
called
public
occasions
instead
of
upon
what
may
truly
be
described
as
private
provocations
has
been
responsible
for
much
verse
which
is
not
only
insufficient
but
insincere
it
has
produced
not
only
many
bad
poems
but
what
is
perhaps
worse
many
bad
poems
from
many
good
poets
the
sincerity
of
miss
sibyl
bristowe
poetry
is
perhaps
most
clearly
proved
by
the
number
of
points
at
which
it
touches
life
and
the
spontaneity
or
even
suddenness
with
which
they
are
touched
it
is
an
occasional
verse
which
arises
out
of
real
occasions
and
not
out
of
merely
fictitious
or
even
merely
formal
ones
thus
while
the
one
or
two
poems
on
the
great
war
are
probably
the
best
they
are
by
no
means
the
biggest
they
are
not
the
most
arresting
in
the
sense
of
being
the
most
ambitious
they
are
arresting
because
the
great
war
really
is
great
and
moves
an
imaginative
spirit
to
great
issues
it
is
public
but
it
is
very
far
from
being
official
the
war
indeed
is
necessarily
more
important
as
a
private
event
even
than
as
a
public
event
and
the
few
but
fine
lines
on
a
brother
fallen
in
a
fight
amid
wild
river
that
sundered
man
from
man
is
a
model
of
the
manner
in
which
such
mighty
events
take
their
place
among
the
impressions
of
the
more
sincere
and
spontaneous
type
of
talent
the
topic
takes
its
by
intensity
and
not
by
space
or
even
in
a
sense
by
design
indeed
it
is
best
expressed
in
a
metaphor
used
by
the
writer
herself
about
the
topic
itself
the
metaphor
of
the
colour
red
in
its
relation
to
other
colours
red
rivets
the
eye
not
by
quantity
but
by
quality
and
in
any
picture
or
pattern
a
spot
or
streak
of
it
will
make
itself
the
feature
or
the
key
miss
sibyl
bristowe
poem
conceives
the
creator
confronted
as
with
a
broken
spectrum
or
a
gap
in
coloured
glass
feeling
the
whole
range
of
vision
to
be
dim
and
impoverished
and
adding
by
the
authority
of
his
own
mysterious
art
the
dreadful
colour
of
martyrdom
indeed
the
point
of
the
comparison
might
very
well
be
conveyed
by
the
two
poems
about
a
london
garden
that
on
the
garden
in
peace
being
comparatively
long
and
that
about
the
garden
in
war
exceedingly
short
short
but
sharply
pathetic
with
its
notion
of
peering
and
probing
for
the
microscope
flowers
that
must
be
a
part
of
the
most
utilitarian
vegetables
indeed
the
short
poems
are
certainly
the
most
successful
and
there
is
the
same
brevity
in
the
last
line
of
the
poem
about
the
tragic
passage
of
time
if
lips
of
children
had
not
told
me
so
the
same
general
impression
as
in
the
comparison
already
noted
is
conveyed
for
instance
in
the
fact
that
the
poems
about
south
africa
are
private
rather
than
public
poems
are
in
that
sense
if
the
phrase
be
properly
comprehended
rather
colonial
than
imperial
that
is
they
are
individual
glimpses
of
great
torrid
wastes
like
similar
individual
glimpses
of
quiet
northern
woods
visions
of
crude
and
golden
cities
as
personal
as
the
parallel
visions
of
normal
northern
cottages
miss
sibyl
bristowe
is
perhaps
an
amateur
in
the
sense
in
which
this
is
generally
true
of
one
who
happens
to
be
an
artist
in
another
art
but
it
is
unfortunate
that
the
world
has
so
much
missed
the
notion
of
that
natural
ardour
that
should
belong
to
the
word

my

my
garden
is
a
tiny
square
of
bordered
green
and
gravel
brown
in
misty
town
and
chimneys
smoky
and
unclean
sweep
to
the
would
not
care
to
visit
there
the
grass
creeps
up
all
in
between
the
stones
and
raises
undisturbed
its
luscious
green
and
laughs
for
youth
in
shrill
and
ringing
tones
i
love
it
that
it
grows
up
so
serene
dauntless
and
bright
and
laughing
me
to
scorn
so
vivid

so
slight
glad
for
the
dew
and
morn
my
little
patch
of
bordered
green
and
brown
sleeps
in
the
bosom
of
a
grim
old
town
i
wish
that
you
could
see
its
beauty
here
with
me
i
tell
you
many
things
you
never
knew
for
few
so
few
know
the
romance
of
such
a
london
strip
with
ferny
screen
that
slants
shy
gleams
of
sunlight
in
between
and
weeds
which
flourish
just
inside
the
dip
holding
their
tenure
with
a
firm
deep
grip
where
prouder
things
all
die
small
wonder
i
tend
my
tall
weed
as
tho
it
were
a
gem
note
every
leaf
and
watch
the
stalwart
stem
wax
strong
and
high
my
weed
plot
lives
in
reckless
luxury
but
in
the
spring
before
black
grime
has
done
its
worst
and
cruel
time
and
dust
accursed
have
marred
the
innocence
of
each
young
leaf
or
soiled
the
blossoms
like
a
wanton
thief
masses
of
tulips
pink
and
white
rise
from
the
earth
in
prim
delight
and
iris
king
of
pomp
and
state
in
vesture
fine
and
purple
and
pale
gold
its
buds
unfold
a
mighty
potentate
and
marshals
nobly
proudly
into
line
whilst
lilacs
sway
in
wind
and
rushing
breeze
bowing
and
nodding
to
some
poplar
trees
but
stay
would
not
care
to
visit
there
midst
such
surroundings
grey
my
garden
but
an
oasis
of
hope
set
in
the
frown
and
dismal
grandeur
of
a
grim
old
town
a
semblance
merely
of
the
lawns
see
a
hint
an
echo
of
the
things
that
be
but
he
or
she
would
be
a
misanthrope
who
would
not
share
my
garden
hope
with
me
my
garden
such
was
my
garden
once
a
springtide
hope
of
flowers
all
rosy
pink
or
violet
or
blue
or
yellow
gold
with
sunflecks
on
the
dew
now
in
their
place
a
summer
garden
towers
of
artichokes
and
turnip
tops
of
peas
and
parsnips
sundry
useful
crops
but
even
vegetables
must
have
flowers
over
the
top
more
minutes
say
yer
prayers
read
yer
bibles
pass
the
rum
more
minutes
strike
me
dumb
they
creeps
on
unawares
those
blooming
minutes
it
queer
i
sorter
stunned
it
ai
with
fear
it
like
as
if
a
frog
waddled
round
in
your
inside
cold
as
straddled
wide
tired
o
where
the
grog
i
play
you
pitch
and
toss
i
wins
and
tails
your
loss
minute
sprinted
by
i
knowed
it
only
break
into
seconds
more
us
and
eternity
every
word
i
ever
said
seems
in
my
head
larst
night
a
little
star
fairly
shook
up
in
the
sky
frightened
by
the
lullaby
rattled
by
the
dogs
of
war
funny
thing
that
star
all
white
saw
old
blighty
too
larst
night
i
ai
ashamed
o
prayers
they
only
wishes
sent

bits
o

from

sod
trailing
up

golden
stairs
well
who
cares
no
pipe
no
blare
no
drum
over
the
top
to
kingdom
come
to
his
dear
memory
april
beneath
the
humid
skies
where
green
birds
wing
and
heavy
burgeoned
trees
sway
in
the
fevered
breeze
my
brother
lies
and
rivers
passionate
a
tore
through
the
mountain
passes
swept
the
plains
with
tears
with
summer
rains
all
wild
all
desolate
whilst
the
deep
of
nature
drunk
with
dreams
below
pangani
by
rufigi
streams
took
him
to
rest
beneath
the
sunlit
skies
where
bright
birds
wing
and
rich
luxuriant
trees
sway
in
the
fevered
breeze
my
brother
lies
the
bending
grasses
woo
his
hurried
grave
a
cross
of
oak
to
show
the
drifting
winds
a
soldier
sleeps
below
our
saviour
cross
i
know
was
wooden
too
a
the
river
rufigi
rose
so
high
the
night
he
died
none
of
his
own
battalion
could
cross
it
to
attend
his
last
honours
sorrow
send
sorrow
away
for
sorrow
is
dressed
in
grey
and
her
eyes
are
dim
with
a
weary
rim
send
sorrow
away
send
sorrow
away
maid
of
the
sombre
sway
breathing
woe
in
a
murmur
low
and
her
lips
are
pale
and
her
body
frail
send
sorrow
away
send
sorrow
away
foe
of
the
dancing
day
oh
her
cheeks
fall
in
and
her
hands
are
thin
but
her
grip
is
fast
on
the
changeless
past
and
they
sere
and
clutch
the
soul
they
touch
send
sorrow
away
send
sorrow
away
for
she
haunts
me
night
and
day
and
sorrow
is
dressed
in
grey
yes
sorrow
is
dressed
in
grey
and
she
looks
so
old
so
drawn
so
cold
send
sorrow
away
alas
so
softly
time
trod
with
me
that
i
lost
his
footsteps
pacing
mine
i
stayed
the
while
to
wrest
the
luscious
fruits
from
love
and
life
he
strode
on
pauselessly
with
thin
cold
smile
so
surely
time
trod
with
me
marred
my
bloom
stole
all
my
roses
spread
his
cobwebs
grey
wrung
all
my
tresses
in
his
silvering
hand
so
stealthily
he
lured
my
youth
away
i
only
learned
that
i
was
old
i
could
have
borne
it
bravely
this
i
know
had
not
the
lips
of
children
told
me
so
a
sacrament
tears
and
i
brought
them
to
the
lord
and
said
what
are
these
crystal
globes
by
nations
shed
what
is
the
crimson
flood
that
stains
the
land
where
is
thy
peace
and
where
thy
guiding
hand
why
are
those
thousands
daily
sacrificed
where
is
thy
might
and
where
the
love
of
christ
and
from
the
heavens
methought
i
heard
a
voice
oh
son
of
earth
i
bid
thee
still
rejoice
those
crystal
tears
by
men
and
nations
shed
water
my
harvest
sanctify
my
dead
that
crimson
flood
which
stains
the
hapless
earth
is
but
the
prelude
to
a
nobler
birth
those
thousands
who
for
home
have
gladly
died
sleep
in
the
hope
of
jesus
crucified
flesh
blood
and
water
little
child
of
mine
veil
in
their
depths
a
mystery
divine
i
bowed
my
head
and
prayed
for
faith
to
see
the
inner
visions
of
calamity
the
tear
knocked
a
man
at
the
shining
gate
hard
and
bad
and
proud
and
old
deep
in
years
for
his
call
was
late
the
gate
was
shut
and
he
had
to
wait
and
he
leaned
awhile
on
his
bag
of
gold
roll
the
heavenly
portals
back
guarded
close
by
a
flaming
sword
the
old
man
opened
out
his
sack

peter
searched
the
sordid
pack
is
this
thy
passport
to
the
lord
saint
peter
sighed
greed
was
all
therein
to
offer
god
he
vainly
sought
one
kindly
deed
one
gentle
word
to
those
in
need
one
little
step
in
mercy
trod
and
is
this
all
saint
peter
said
this
fruitless
hoard
of
worthless
sin
this
earthly
gold
which
weighs
like
lead
oh
wretched
man
thy
soul
is
thou
mayst
thou
canst
not
enter
in
could
i
have
found
one
single
sign
of
life
within
thy
sordid
soul
one
kindling
spark
of
life
divine
the
flames
of
hell
had
not
been
thine
hence
and
he
seal
the
judgment
scroll
down
to
the
fires
whose
lurid
light
lick
and
blazoned
the
depths
of
hell
mocking
red
in
the
pitchy
night
down
ever
down
from
out
god
sight
down
to
the
damned
the
miser
fell
there
in
the
haunts
of
deepest
sin
satan
watched
with
his
sombre
eye
the
trembling
miser
peered
within
he
thought
to
find
his
kith
and
kin
whose
guilt
condemned
them
too
to
die
he
wandered
round
from
place
to
place
then
beat
his
breast
with
wondering
moan
for
lo
of
all
the
human
race
the
miser
stood
in
hell
alone
for
all
had
found
some
saving
grace
that
set
them
free
to
seek
god
face
and
could
their
vilest
sins
atone
he
cowered
low
in
abject
fear
no
single
virtue
could
he
plead
satan
own
by
self
decreed
when
sudden
a
dastard
deed
the
devil
cried
what
lieth
here
it
was
a
single
tear
shed
in
an
hour
of
direst
need
once
he
had
wept
in
grief
and
pain
once
when
his
child
lay
coldly
dead
once
he
had
prayed
no
prayer
is
vain
this
prayer
had
lived
to
save
again
and
bring
remission
on
his
head
only
a
tear
the
heavenly
choir
praised
the
lord
for
the
thing
call
love
but
satan
shrieked
in
frenzied
ire
this
foolish
tear
will
quench
my
fire
this
man
must
go
above
above
back
again
where
the
flaming
sword
closely
guarded
the
jewelled
door
i
seek
he
humbly
sobbed
our
lord
i
brought
thee
gold
a
worthless
hoard
thou
wouldst
not
let
me
in
before
but
now
i
come
to
thee
with
this
a
little
thing
is
very
small
i
pray
thee
take
it
not
amiss
my
gold
is
in
the
dark
abyss

little

shows
the

in

a
vision
of
a
day
that
is
past
the
sky
hung
smooth
the
line
of
hill
that
shadowed
the
valley
that
seemed
so
still
and
the
blackbird
whistled
his
love
notes
shrill
the
church
lay
dreaming
of
god
and
when
the
bodies
should
rise
from
her
graveyard
pen
where
the
high
grass
covered
her
poor
dead
men
the
water
meadows
shone
rich
with
gold
gold
that
the
buttercups
had
sold
to
the
nibbling
sheep
of
the
red
and
even
the
river
murmured
rest
as
the
sun
sank
low
in
the
tender
west
and
the
earth
flowers
slept
on
their
mother
breast
over
the
valley
that
seemed
so
still
where
the
blackbird
whistled
his
shrill
i
gazed
and
all
against
my
will
i
saw
a
vision
beneath
the
hill
centuries
passed
like
a
mist
away
and
i
stood
in
the
glare
of
a
burning
day
whilst
the
clamoured
a
call
to
pray
war
and
its
brother
raced
hand
in
hand
that
brother
called
death
and
they
seared
the
land
with
their
fiery
breath
and
the
murder
brand
and
copses
and
dales
were
bleeding
red
naught
was
sacred
the
living
or
dead
the
old
old
man
or
the
girl
just
men
stormed
the
homestead
blazed
the
corn
pillaged
and
sacked
from
night
till
morn
and
spitted
the
babe
that
was
newly
born
savage
and
brutal
like
freed
they
swarmed
the
hill
debauched
with
greed
some
slunk
behind
their
lust
to
feed
at
last
when
the
streams
ran
human
blood
soaking
the
fields
in
a
scarlet
flood
a
woman
prayed
with
her
child
for
food
all
on
their
way
those
soldiers
passed
with
a
foetid
jest
at
her
hapless
fast
and
some
men
cut
her
down
at
last
they
cut
her
down
oh
woe
is
me
and
they
left
her
to
rot
in
her
misery
naked
and
scorned
for
the
world
to
see
they
left
her
bare
in
the
cold
night
air
save
only
the
comb
in
her
hair
and
they
strangled
the
baby
helpless
there
they
did
not
trouble
to
wind
them
round
in
a
sheet
of
earth
in
the
dewy
ground
they
looted
them
both
for
the
spoil
they
found
but
the
wind
was
kind
it
wailed
aloud
and
churned
the
dust
till
it
rose
a
cloud
like
a
pearly
mist
to
form
a
shroud
and
the
leaves
swooned
down
to
the
wind
sweet
call
and
covered
the
mother
and
babe
and
all
till
they
lay
at
peace
in
a
soft
green
pall
the
church
still
ponders
and
wonders
when
those
bodies
will
rise
from
her
graveyard
pen
but
she
knows
they
are
blessed
those
poor
dead
men
for
they
sleep
within
her
christian
fold
under
her
consecrated
mould
where
a
verse
was
read
and
a
prayer
was
told
but
under
the
hill
in
the
leaves
somewhere
lie
a
mother
and
child
all
stark
and
bare
save
only
a
comb
in
the
hair
yet
god
will
remember
they
lie
out
there
whilst
digging
up
a
hitherto
uncultivated
bit
of
garden
near
the
mendips
a
gardener
came
across
the
mutilated
skeletons
of
a
woman
and
baby
a
comb
still
decorated
the
woman
hair
at
the
inquest
afterwards
held
upon
the
skeletons
it
was
suggested
that
the
woman
and
her
baby
were
probably
refugees
from
the
battle
of
sedgemoor
bitterness
casteth
out
love
over
the
hill
where
the
white
road
sweeps
and
the
dead
fern
holds
the
snow
love
flew
by
and
the
black
night
sky
shadowed
the
vales
below
down
in
the
creek
where
the
gleam
and
the
trees
stand
gaunt
and
bare
i
crouched
me
down
and
the
sullen
frown
of
earth
entombed
me
there
ah
mocked
the
hard
and
clear
man
with
the
frozen
soul
love
sailed
by
on
a
sky
with
the
tears
that
sorrow
stole
gone
said
the
fern
from
your
touch
gone
from
your
winter
heart
love
flew
by
like
the
tattered
sigh
bitterness
tore
apart
and
the
aching
trees
bowed
branch
and
twig
and
a
shrivelled
leaf
made
cry
if
you
are
cold
and
your
heart
be
old
for
certain
love
must
die
over
the
hill
where
the
white
road
sweeps
and
the
dead
fern
holds
the
snow
sweet
love
fled
and
a
spirit
dead
spectres
the
slopes
below
the
hour
of
happiness
the
world
is
fair
the
circling
swell
of
fresh
tumultuous
sea
holds
life
within
its
rhythmic
rise
and
bursts
of
harmony
and
chasing
down
the
sky
empty
their
hearts
as
they
sweep
by
the
world
is
gay
such
lilt
and
song
such
mellowness
of
tune
such
drifting
airs
from
wave
and
shore
from
rock
and
sand
and
dune
i
did
not
know
that
clouds
of
spray
splashed
as
they
fell
a
roundelay
a
magic
day
a
magic
hand
has
raised
a
magic
mood
oh
years
ago
god
made
the
world
and
saw
that
it
was
good
and
from
his
ecstasy
divine
i
borrowed
this
sweet
hour
of
mine
thoughts
so
fair
so
delicate
the
thoughts
he
marvelled
they
could
be
his
own
he
did
not
dream
that
they
were
birds
from
heaven
flown
birds
with
a
message
in
their
throats
limpid
and
golden
from
the
sky
most
wonderful
his
song
was
strange
he
knew
not
why
they
fluttered
their
white
wings
awhile
then
soared
again
to
paradise
leaving
a
trail
of
limpid
notes
for
sacrifice
the
things
unsaid
are
the
things
that
count
you
told
me
you
had
done
with
love
you
showed
me
why
you
said
it
often
just
to
prove
inconstancy
i
never
heard
i
only
marked
the
word
you
told
me
you
had
thoughts
beyond
my
own
poor
love
a
wider
sphere
ambitions
fond
god
above
in
rosy
bliss
i
only
felt
th
ungiven
kiss
i
knew
one
day
that
unsaid
word
would
dress
in
shining
letters
spelling
happiness
i
knew
that
love
would
one
day
be
mine
own
a
tender
suppliant
for
forgiveness
won
i
had
no
fear
tho
cold
and
clear
you
gave
your
answer
sweet
my
dear
i
never
heard
your
spoken
word
the
song
of
the
long
ago
wraith
of
the
years
wandering
too
and
fro
floating
to
earth
on
the
hallowed
tones
of
a
song
of
long
ago
shadows
of
those
asleep
steal
through
the
simple
lay
lifting
the
silvery
veil
aside
of
a
long
lost
yesterday
beautiful
silent
days
raised
from
the
silent
past
in
the
pregnant
chords
of
a
once
loved
song
memory
speaks
at
last
of
the
golden
summer
eves
shrined
in
the
mists
of
years
and
a
world
of
hopes
dear
god
what
hopes
born
to
the
soul
in
tears
but
the
youthful
hopes
creep
by
stealing
with
solemn
chime
to
a
finite
grave
they
will
rise
in
faith
when
eternity
conquers
time
tender
song
sacred
and
sweet
and
old
with
the
lingering
touch
of
a
bygone
age
i
have
scanned
again
in
thy
page
a
tale
that
was
long
since
told
the
sinner
dreaming
when
the
great
sun
flung
bands
of
gold
bands
to
the
number
of
seven
on
the
limpid
sea
we
followed
the
gold
and
climbed
on
our
way
to
heaven
there
to
the
portals
of
cloud
and
storm
piled
high
in
the
regions
of
thunder
till
we
reached
the
sky
in
its
columns
of
storm
and
god
gates
rolled
asunder
below
the
world
like
a
ball
of
mist
with
us
pearl
and
jacinth
and
beryl
and
it
faded
away
that
mist
and
we
clung
to
the
gates
in
peril
myrrh
and
incense
and
jacinth
and
pearl
how
we
cringed
on
the
floor
of
heaven
and
the
great
sun
drew
its
bands
from
the
pearl
bands
to
the
number
of
seven
and
now
as
we
gaze
from
our
sphere
to
the
shadows
where
earth
is
seeming
we
know
that
that
hazy
circling
sphere
was
only
a
sinner
dreaming
woman
when
god
made
woman
fair
he
made
her
as
the
rose
her
face
upturned
to
catch
his
radiant
smile
his
sunbeams
lurked
the
while
about
her
lips
with
care
he
chose
her
hair
and
glory
and
her
round
white
throat
the
pillared
keeper
of
her
woman
note
god
filled
her
eyes
with
innocence
and
love
and
glimpsing
lights
from
out
his
skies
above
the
father
knew
that
she
was
beautiful
and
yet
to
make
her
nobly
dutiful
to
him
within
her
breast
he
set
a
shrine
all
holy
and
possessed
in
shining
mystery
and
few
who
know
to
enter
in
the
evading
flame
aglow
that
fills
the
shrine
is
white
as
unshed
snow
and
deep
within
that
casket
of
her
breast
are
secret
joys
to
god
alone
confessed
christmas
white
the

white
the
weather
stars
and
ice

one

february
i
do
not
sing
for
youth
and
love
for
passion
and

i
only
sing
because
the

fire
i
only
sing
because
the
day
is
blue
the
grass
is
green
the
birds
are
singing
out
their
hearts
the
waking
twigs
between
because
the
chestnut
branch
is
tipped
with
buds
of
folded
brown
because
the
snowdrops
look
so
white
the
catkins
feather
down
because
the
naked
elms
have
bent
to
whisper
me
this
thing
the

stirring
in

gently
from
the

every

a

men

an

or
two
of
a

from

prisoned
them
in

stay
scattered
fragments
that
your

have
blown
this

small

thin
and

beneath

unfurled
roll
the
symphonies
which
dominate
the
world
the
grey
wind
i
have
been
where
never
man
went
with
the
grey
wind
far
from
the
gorse
and
the
wet
earth
scent
i
have
been
i
have
seen
what
no
man
hath
seen
with
the
grey

i
have
cowered
down

knees
between
i
have

i
have
heard
what
no
man
hath
heard
with
the
grey
wind
the
dry
leaves
crackle
and
snap
at
his
word
i
have
heard
i
have
heard
and
i
watched
them
fly
all
the
wild
leaves
in
a
hustled
crowd
to
the
stormy
sky
at
his
word
and
they
swept
in
a
whirlwind
wan
churned
by
his
breath
out
to
the
windways
where
never
sun
shone
forth
they
swept
whiles
they
leapt
in
a
maddened
dance
swung
scatterwise
eddied
and
swirled
to
a
swift
advance
till
they
crept
spent
and
worn
in
their
frenzied
fear
leaves
of
chittering
feebly
in
masses
sere
crazed
and
slow
and
i
know
what
never
man
knew
those
poor
dead
leaves
are
the
souls
of
men
the
grey
wind
slew
this
i
know
poeta
nascitur
tho
all
may
know
it
rules
only
never
made
a
poet
he
thought
to
shape
his
writings
into
verse
he
pruned
them
down
to
language
fixed
and
terse
but
finding
that
would
give
his
tricks
no
play
spurned
his
reserve
and
tried
another
way
this
time
he
dressed
the
naked
words
with
care
trimmed
them
with
adjectives
and
adverbs
fair
and
studying
every
law
of
form
and
rhyme
pieced
up
his
metre
into
studious
time
but
still
whatever
medium
he
chose
his
work
remained
poor
tortured
unsexed
prose
one
eve
whilst
pondering
in
the
vale
he
felt
the
leaves
in
the
dale
stooping
he
caught
a
whisper
from
the
sky
that
slipped
from
out
the
twilight
whimsically
its
tender
sorrow
touched
him
as
it
fell
quickened
his
fancies
stirred
his
heart
as
well
in
reverent
awe
he
heard
its
mystic
call
a
glory
permeating
all
he
did
not
dare
to
pin
that
whisper
down
to
words
so
peacocked
in
a
flaunting
gown
the
forms
of
metre
he
had
conned
so
well
were
all
inadequate
that
sigh
to
tell
no
further
use
that
artificial
code
those
simpered
rhymes
his
petty
bandbox
mode
of
trumpery
no
need
to
pace
the
solemn
pavements
of
the
commonplace
each
little
trick
each
fantasy
of
art
were
stones
that
blocked
th
outpourings
of
his
heart
he
looked
beyond
the
great
inrushing
sea
seeing
at
last
the
hidden
things
that
be
and
of
the
wave
he
learnt
a
cadence
sweet
strong
as
its
life
a
lilt
of
rippling
feet
whilst
from
the
wind
that
swept
the
answering
trees
he
culled
the
moaning
rhythm
of
the
breeze
he
weaved
that
whisper
of
the
twilight
sky
into
a
poem
soft
with
melody
it
thrilled
the
soul
in
motion
strong
and
free
wild
as
the
wave
a
break
of
ecstasy
it
kissed
the
borderland
heaven
and
earth
sweet
in
its
passion
holy
in
its
mirth
and
lo
a
light
gleamed
through
each
noble
line
the
wind
crooned
softly
starways
seemed
to
shine
that
poem
was
divine
queen
elizabeth
she
would
dance
a
coranto
that
the
french
ambassador
hidden
behind
a
curtain
might
report
her
sprightliness
to
his
greene
so
elizabeth
danced
and
the
guest
was
entranced
as
she
tripped
the
coranto
and
curtseyed
and
swayed
in
a
robe
of
rich
stuff
jewelled
slashings
and
ruff
and
a
stomacher
stiff
thick
with
pearlings
and
braid
ho
he
peeped
round
the
curtain
is
perfectly
certain
enraptured
of
mien
at
the
tiptoeing
queen
in
a
courtly
way
in
a
frenchy
way
in
a
naughty
way
in
that
tudor
day
yes
he
peeped
round
the
screen
and
he
sniggered
i
ween
this
is
only
a
woman
to
flatter
and
kiss
a
creature
of
vanity
madam
what
bliss
to
have
witnessed
such
grace
such
elegant
here
he
could
find
no
more
words
and
emotion
was
clear
choked
all
further
utterance
for
never
had
such
a
dance
entered
his
thought
such
slippers
and
ought
he
to
mention
the
hose
all
of
silk
to
suppose
had
the
muse
from
olympus
stepped
down
for
a
while
terpsichore
style
then
quite
without
guile
he
bowed
very
low
in
his
frenchified
way
in
that
courtly
way
of
a
day
and
the
laugh
of
the
lady
was
merry
and
gay
and
all
throughout
europe
the
fame
of
her
spread
her
frivolous
tricks
and
the
foreigners
said
it
was
only
a
princess
a
slave
to
her
pride
true
child
of
a
mother
a
king
had
decried
so
she
thwarted
and
twisted
the
world
to
her
whim
as
he
misunderstood
her
she
outwitted
him
now
one
day
it
arose
that
king
philip
of
spain
incensed
at
her
folly
essayed
yet
again
to
bring
her
to
reason
just
at
his
own
season
so
he
sent
his
ambassador
spanish
mendoza
to
this
slippery
queen
with
a
message
sub
rosa
nay
by
mine
honour
she
simpered
how
now
is
it
truce
to
my
jest
is
a
pity
i
trow
it
were
best
to
be
merry
she
yawned
very
wide
and
the
spaniard
furtively
smiled
at
her
side
was
only
a
woman
to
flatter
and
kiss
be
easy
to
manage
a
creature
like
this
and
wise
sat
the
gaunt
english
queen
her
words
were
unyielding
her
purse
it
was
mean
the
spanish
ambassador
writhed
like
a
matador
beaten
and
wounded
he
played
to
her
vanity
it
was
tucked
out
of
sight
and
with
spanish
profanity
he
cursed
all
the
protestants
under
his
breath
and
committed
them
gently
to
burnings
and
death
but
never
an
inch
did
elizabeth
yield
and
the
messenger
saw
that
his
mission
was
sealed
in
that
day
and
elizabeth
laughed
in
a
curious
way
that
was
subtle
with
craft
under
favour
you
may
tell
your
master
in
spain
that
my
country
comes
first
i
am
england
and
english
its
best
and
its
worst
tell
him
my
subjects
i
love
as
my
children
tell
him
they
thirst
but
their
mouths
will
be
filled
when
they
meet
him
at
sea
give
that
greeting
from
me
back
to
madrid
went
that
spanish
ambassador
broken
and
bruised
like
a
matador
and
he
bowed
very
low
it
was
etiquette
so
and
he
cried
oh
that
queen
is
the
devil
in
sooth
a
fool
sire
was
thought
for
she
danced
so
uncouth
but
her
bargains
are
hard
as
her
heart
and
her
hand
as
her
dreary
dominions
her
men
and
her
land
and
never
be
gulled
by
her
feminine
vanity
is
only
a
pose
all
her
vacant
inanity
let
us
man
an
armada
to
crush
her
and
raid
her
to
send
her
to
hell
to
the
demons
who
made
her
and
they
came
as
you
know
heavy
ships
big
and
slow
in
a
lumbering
way
in
a
blundering
way
in
that
tudor
day
proudly
up
channel
their
galleons
swept
swiftly
our
pinnaces
hustled
and
leapt
at
their
rear
dogs
tracking
their
prey
and
biting
and
snapping
and
snarling
and
yapping
delighted
and
fierce
at
the
chance
of
a
fray
god
how
the
spaniards
fled
in
a
panic
when
our
had
neared
them
and
blazed
them
and
seared
them
wrapping
their
hulks
in
red
flamings
satanic
god
how
they
scattered
slipped
anchor
and
shattered
sails
tattered
masts
battered
up
to
the
north
whilst
a
mighty
rose
wildly
and
strong
to
hinder
and
pester
their
perilous
flight
how
they
foundered
and
sank
on
that
treacherous
bank
lost
lost
evermore
on
our
alien
shore
with
their
grim
freight
of
death
and
the
poisonous
breath
of
scurvy
and
pestilence
hunger
despair
the
struggling
remainder
of
galleons
bear
them
back
to
the
port
of
corunna
again
all
all
that
is
left
to
the
pride
of
proud
spain
courageous
and
calm
with
the
valour
of
men
elizabeth
waited
the
chances
and
then
my
children
are
fed
and
their
enemies
dead
cried
the
frivolous
queen
majestic
of
mien
she
towered
her
wisdom
and
high
inspiration
the
might
of
a
people
the
soul
of
a
nation
and
even
i
will
wager
that
no
man
can
fathom
the
mind
or
the
depths
of
a
woman
the
death
of
queen
elizabeth
only
so
lonely
was
ever
woman
quite
so
lonely
clad
in
a
rich
bejewelled
dress
unchanged
for
nigh
a
week
her
stiff
ruff
disarranged
her
fierce
eyes
staring
dully
at
the
floor
fear
on
that
face
which
knew
fear
before
elizabeth
finger
on
lip
she
sits
time
has
outgrown
that
gorgeous
england
which
was
once
her
own
those
solemn
courtiers
pacing
to
and
fro
outside
the
palace
neither
care
nor
know
the
dying
queen
is
lonely
ha
what
was
that
plotters
within
the
gate
and
she
contemptuous
victim
once
of
hate
and
score
of
plots
plunges
her
naked
sword
thrice
through
the
arras
which
had
never
stirred
afraid
huddled
amidst
the
pillows
gaunt
and
old
she
shivers
this
gay
daughter
of
a
gold
entrancing
age
the
debonair
gallant
who
sang
her
now
the
mocking
sycophant
the
ministers
she
trusted
gone
the
throne
she
loved
with
all
her
passion
left
for
one
of
stock
and
seed
she
loathed
mere
english
she
shrinks
from
the
new
and
cold
sobriety
of
chill
advancing
fashion
only
death
to
woo
this
poor
this
great
elizabeth
was
ever
woman
quite
so
lonely
the
plea
of
the
antarctic
the
best
people
to
judge
are
those
who
served
under
captain
scott
had
we
been
in
the
same
place
as
the
victims
we
should
have
wished
our
bodies
to
remain
at
rest
where
we
had
given
our
best
efforts
in
the
cause
we
earnestly
believed
commander
evans
out
of

a
clear
voice
said
give
me
the
right
to
bury
my
great
dead
no
lands
can
honour
them
as
i
nor
wrap
them
round
in
such
pale
purity
leave
them
with
me
alone
in
my
white

place
england
flag
above
their

unfurled
i
need
great
souls
great
hero
souls
to
bless
and
consecrate
my
snowy
wilderness
the
stranger
in
london
is
a
big
big
place
and
the
clouds
that
gather
the
grey
skies
in
are
frayed
by
chimneys
black
and
old
serried
stacks
of
grime
and
sin
and
every
road
and
every
street
has
a
secret
tale
to
guard
and
hold
mid
the
echoing
tones
of
passing
feet
oh
weary
place
brimmed
up
with
life
confused
in

i
have
little
part
in
your
daily
round
for

there
are
houses
surely
which
open
their
door
to

for

they
stand
in
a
formal
row
story
on

floor
upon
floor
shielding
themselves
from
the
crimson
sun
from
the
mutter
of
traffic
and
wagon
of
footstep
and
cry
with
curtain
and
shutter
mute
houses
which
shun
all
light
sound
and
me
inexorably
sometimes
when
i
toss
on
my
pillow
at
night
when
the
spluttering
rain
spreads
the
smuts
on
the
pane
i
dream
that
those
mansions
relax
their
grim
pride
and
opening
wide
their
intimate
hearts
to
me
chill
taciturnity
melts
in
the
warmth
of
rich
colour
and

vast

are
alight
with
radiant
desire
to
show
hospitality
lavish
regality
squanders
the

in

i
wander
unseen
through
the

pillared
corridors

soft
red
of
the
shimmering
hangings
the

glow
ablaze
in

me
throughly
i

there

place
for
me
there
in
those
homes
i
thought
dead
but
sleep
open

fails
with
the

forcing
the
hopes
of
me
back
into
night
never
to
open
never
to

stern
cold
houses
closed
to
me
gathering
storms
which
smirch
the

may
i
come

come
in
the
transvaal
in
june
under
the
deep
blue
vault
of
a
hot
relentless
sky
burns
the
hot
red
deep
and
the
hot
red
road
and
the
choking
dust
like
a
rust
corrode
soars
up
in
spirals
high
under
the
span
of
a
hot
and
brazen
sky
cries
the
thirsty
drift
for
a
summer
rain
baring
its
naked
stones
in
vain
and
its
mud
in
misery
under
the
cloudless
curve
of
a
wide
remorseless
sky
sleeps
the
patchy
scrub
of
the
sweeping
veld
and
the
slim
blue
gums
and
the
wattle
belt
where
the
shrike
broods
watchfully
under
the
sullen
glare
of
the
grim
unblinking
sky
the
hot
dorp
pants
the
red
roofs
daze
the
mule
tracks
scorch
the
blaze
in
their
agony
johannesburg
miraculous
city
thoughts
stupendous
to
crush
the
wise
buildings
monstrous
which
brush
the
skies
raise
your
eyes
in
awe
yet
pity
this
marvellous
golden
mushroom
city
hear
the
roar
like
the
moan
of
the
sea
when
the
wave
curls
back
from
the
granite
rock
which
whirls
it
back
a
great
unceasingly
grinding
drone
in
a
heavy
unyielding
monotone
is
the
frenzied
wail
of
the
lost
in
pain
the
shriek
of
the
damned
raised
in
vain
again
again
and
the
stamping
machine
with
a
brutal
joy
wrenches
the
gold
from
its
quartz
alloy
crushing
the
tortured
stone
to
dust
as
it
yields
the
ore
to
the
vast
unquenchable
thirst
for
lust
the
south
wind
as
it
sweeps
the
veld
with
its
icy
breath
biting
the
scrub
with
its
teeth
of
death
lifting
the
dust
like
a
phantom
shroud
from
the
tailing
heaps
in
a
veil
of
cloud
scattering
the
belching
smoke
which
flies
from
the
chimney
line
that
marks
the
rise
of
the
main
reef
ridge
some
devil
bridge
to
bind
the
town
to
the
broad
full
plain
which
rolls
beyond
like
the
boundless
main
precocious
town
the
forward
child
of
a
youthful
state
so
young
in
years
so
rich
so
great
in
gilt
renown
and
glittering
fate
oh
ponder
deep
all
ye
yet
pity
this
marvellous
golden
city
in
the
land
of
the
silences
she
stood
before
the
tent
a
winging
tent
in
thicknesses
of
canvas
taut
and
strong
burning
beneath
a
sun
unreticent
raised
upon
planks
and
lashed
with
rope
and
thong
and
she
was
fair
a
sprig
of
english
may
born
for
the
kiss
of
merriment
and
day
wide
from
the
tent
like
swell
on
swell
of
sea
the
great
veld
swept
and
rolled
in
curves
away
a
shabby
patch
of
god
eternity
neglected
by
the
angels
bare
and
grey
and
solitary
dick
and
she
had
made
this
veld
their
home
for
seasons
three
she
remembered
that
first
reckless
ride
their
wedding
journey
over
spruit
and
land
the
straggling
snares
the
kopje
side
the
crumbling
blockhouse
dreaming
of
command
holding
a
loot
of
empty
pot
and
tin
which
once
had
held
a
soldier
guard
within
the
drift
the
dust
all
baked
and
red
twisting
in
spiral
devils
raw
as
rust
those
lonely
crosses
leaning
on
their
dead
murmuring
africa
was
never
just
she
knows
no
pity
shrieked
the
fierce
south
wind
she
steals
your
youth
and
stultifies
your
mind
on
on
they
flew
past
kaffir
boom
and
kraal
thorn
fleshy
aloe
clump
through
the
charred
stretches
of
the
high
transvaal
by
meerkat
hole
and
rounded
hump
of
tunnelled
earth
she
laughed
the
air
was
wild
strong
with
exhilaration
undefiled
at
last
they
reined
across
the
scrub
and
veld
dick
pointed
with
his
sjambok
to
the
white
outspreading
tent
then
to
the
wattle
belt
that
marshalled
thinly
in
the
shimmering
light
there
lies
our
home
dear
love
for
you
and
me
she
looked
up
gladly
smiled
him
tenderly
summer
had
followed
winter
radiant
rich
reckless
with
life
extravagant
in
bloom
mad
for
the
first
wild
draught
of
water
which
burst
from
the
whose
massive
gloom
blackened
the
skies
then
splitting
ripped
and
tore
deep
gorges
through
the
tracks
with
deafening
roar
the
storms
swept
by
a
fairyland
of
green
mantled
the
waking
plains
wide
flowers
sprang
to
their
feet
the
streams
ran
strong
and
clean
the
soft
mimosa
sprinkled
into
showers
of
golden
balls
the
oleander
hedge
swayed
to
the
line
of
gums
with
leaves
on
edge
and
it
was
summer
now
beth
crossed
the
sloot
grown
arrogant
with
rains
which
lapped
her
square
of
gorgeous
garden
swirling
to
the
spruit
beyond
in
childish
hurry
was
he
there
she
scanned
the
far
horizon
no
no
sign
of
man
or
beast
to
break
the
distance
line
stay
was
that
he
beyond
the
drift
ah
no
only
her
wishes
trembling
in
the
air
and
mirage
heat
a
train
sedate
and
slow
wheeled
round
the
kopje
far
away
the
glare
of
brazen
sun
beat
in
her
eyes
too
late
he
would
not
come
in
lonely
state
she
must
endure
these
dragging
hours
this
th
unspoken
horror
of
her
life
the
dread
that
sapped
her
strength
and
drained
her
powers
the
guarded
secret
of
a
brave
man
wife
dick
would
come
back
with
the
light
of
morn
but
fear
would
be
her
lord
beth
turned
her
to
the
stoep
with
sensuous
breath
the
moonflower
drenched
the
garden
in
its
scent
ardent
voluptuous
and
white
as
death
it
hung
long
blossoms
heavy
with
intent
the
morning
glories
folded
into
sleep
lay
purple
in
undress
and
slumber
deep
behind
the
wattles
rose
the
circled
moon
splashing
her
silver
over
poort
and
track
the
boys
went
chattering
to
their
kraals
and
soon
long
shadows
ribbed
the
tent
in
white
and
black
beth
closed
the
entrance
fast
then
slowly
sped
a
lonely
woman
to
a
lonely
bed
come
away
come
away
come
come
come
away
for
the
moon
for
the
moon
wove
a
shroud
in
the
day
all
of
white
all
of
white
which
she
flings
over
all
in
the
night
in
the
night
like
a
pall
in
the
night
in
the
night
come
away
come
away
come
come
come
away
for
the
moon
for
the
moon
threw
my
blossoms
a
ray
they
are
white
deadly
white
and
their
petals
are
pale
wan
and
light
do
not
fail
come
away
in
the
night
come

come

come
come
come

for
the

for

a

in

and
my
scent
oh
my
scent
which
i
waft
over
all
is
of
death
feel
its
breath
and
the
moon
made
a
pall
which
she
lent
to
us
all
to
us
all
come
away
come
away
come
come
come
come
come
the
sleeper
moved
an
argent
shroud
woven
with
silver
into
stars
was
that
the
moonflower
singing
from
the
cloud
why
were
its
petals
bruised
and
veined
with
scars
come
it
was
not
the
moonflower
wide
awake
beth
started
up
that
voice
for
pity
sake
that
dear
loved
voice
the
midnight
echoed
clear
rang
with
that
urgent
summons
from
the
veld
that
startling
premonition
far
and
near
cries
shivered
through
her
brain
dick
voice
she
felt
it
vibrant
in
her
ears
a
call
for
her
she
sprang
up
quickly
every
sense
astir
down
past
the
shadowed
garden
through
the
kloof
she
knew
the
way
she
followed
to
the
cry
no
stealthy
footpad
sound
of
howl
or
hoof
could
scare
her
in
the
awful
mystery
of
knowledge
dick
had
called
terrestrial
things
nor
checked
her
nor
appalled
this
is
the
shroud
she
murmured
over
all
the
moon
had
spread
her
splendour
cold
and
white
this
is
the
shining
drapery
the
pall
this
hoary
sheet
of
clean
pellucid
light
grasping
a
small
revolver
in
her
hand
she
hurried
on
across
the
broken
land
a
mighty
silence
wrapped
the
veld
in
dreams
the
breath
of
night
hung
in
the
soundless
air
a
wilderness
unknown
unconquered
streams
lay
with
the
universe
at
one
to
dare
in
majesty
of
nature
undisturbed
the
flux
of
centuries
untrod
uncurbed
the
white
world
grew
before
her
silhouettes
of
shadowed
kopjes
struck
against
the
sky
the
vlei
gleamed
fitfully
with
frets
the
coarse
grass
cut
the
horizon
lustily
the
dancing
moonway
on
the
swollen
drift
broke
into
patterns
on
the
current
swift
thwarted
beth
stared
in
piteous
dismay
a
frantic
river
wild
with
recent
rains
largened
beyond
all
daring
barred
her
way
flooding
the
plains
drunk
with
illicit
gains
it
dashed
with
savage
fury
tossing
high
its
waters
over
bank
and
boundary
the
girl
looked
anxiously
around
below
the
river
widened
shallowing
its
bed
seeming
to
flow
on
leisurely
and
slow
above
it
narrowed
to
a
ravine
fed
by
the
fountains
three
rocks
stood
solemnly
midstream
on
hocks
straightly
she
turned
towards
the
upper
reach
the
portly
rocks
as
old
and
grey
as
time
offered
a
bridge
on
past
the
sunken
beach
of
unclean
ooze
the
sea
of
gathered
slime
across
the
hunching
boulders
where
the
course
of
huddled
waters
broke
their
angry
force
climbing
from
rock
to
rock
from
crest
to
crest
she
threw
her
weight
upon
the
further
bank
into
a
clod
of
mud
whose
squelching
breast
received
her
greedily
she
seized
the
rank
wild
clumps
of
herbage
with
her
hands
then
strove
until
she
reached
the
trusty
ridge
above
over
the
drift
the
whisperings
of
her
soul
soothed
every
hindrance
to
a
thing
of
naught
the
billowing
veld
its
tawny
ceaseless
roll
was
but
the
highway
to
the
end
she
sought
love
was
her
pilot
and
by
love
controlled
its
radiance
led
her
like
the
star
of
old
far
to
the
east
a
straggling
knot
of
trees
hinted
a
farm
was
nestling
in
their
rear
the
scent
of
flowers
floated
on
the
breeze
the
cattle
in
their
kraals
in
safety
near
drowsed
in
the
heavy
slumber
hours
of
night
but
to
the
west
she
hurried
in
her
flight
on
on
past
trackless
scrub
where
all
around
like
shapeless
monsters
bulging
heap
on
heap
crouched
the
vast
ant
heaps
on
the
virgin
ground
and
winding
in
and
out
them
pressed
and
deep
two
wheel
spoors
scarred
the
earth
she
traced
the
curve
the
cart
had
chiselled
in
a
sudden
swerve
with
feverish
haste
she
followed
line
on
line
each
rut
that
carved
itself
in
sand
here
by
the
grace
of
heaven
was
a
sign
a
way
to
realise
her
dream
command
her
instinct
prophecy
god
what
was
that
rending
the
silences
with
tear
and
scrat
again
that
shot
then
all
the
world
lay
still
calm
in
the
deep
placidity
of
strength
that
recks
for
nothing
human
passive
till
man
desecrates
its
hallowed
peace
at
length
but
to
that
sound
she
fled
for
dick
lay
west
his
wide
eyes
staring
blood
upon
his
breast
dead
with
his
face
against
the
dead
a
scarlet
river
flowing
flowing
oh
his
lips
were
red
his
hands
the
plains
were
red
she
knelt
beside
him
spoke
him
loudly
so
he
needs
must
hear
she
bound
his
wounds
in
vain
that
nerveless
heap
would
never
speak
again
dawn
came
at
last
no
need
to
wail
or
cry
dick
was
beyond
all
help
and
none
would
hear
she
clasped
him
in
her
agony
feeling
the
young
gold
morning
fresh
and
clear
yet
seeing
nothing
stunned
to
outward
things
she
only
knew
the
dullness
sorrow
brings
and
in
her
numbness
heeded
not
the
red
tall
grasses
swaying
as
they
bowed
and
bent
beneath
a
crawling
kaffir
or
his
head
rear
up
a
cringing
caterpillar
sent
to
rob
the
great
white
baas
for
plenty
slow
some
white
men
take
to
die
as
black
men
know
but
if
the
baas
were
dead
beyond
all
doubt
slink
could
be
brave
his
belly
clave
the
ground
had
anybody
heard
the
white
man
shout
caught
by
the
kopjes
echoed
in
rebound
ach
how
he
wriggled
now
the
cart
was
slink
the
scoff
the
silver
watch
the
fiery
drinks
and
look
the
mules
outspanned
were
plenty
good
so
was
the
stolen
gun
he
reached
the
pool
of
crimson
where
the
stood
he
slithered
nearer
wet
in
dewdrops
cool
his
rough
patched
trousers
soaked
then
sneaking
round
peeped
from
his
vantage
to
the
bleeding
ground
spooks
his
eyes
bulged
down
dropped
his
brutal
jaw
rooted
to
where
he
clung
with
fright
the
cramps
of
terror
gripping
at
his
maw
spooks
pallid
spooks
he
shrieked
away
the
sight
till
the
wide
veld
was
reeling
blurred
and
pale
a
spook
arose
to
follow
on
his
trail
it
glided
nearer
nearer
nearer
yet
tall
as
the
english
mysi
far
away
his
tongue
stuck
in
his
throat
and
bleeding
wet
he
saw
the
master
sitting
up
at
bay
he
heard
his
name
he
heard
the
still
air
crack
then
dropped
astonished
wondering
on
his
back
till
every
spook
had
vanished
slink
had
gone
to
make
a
longer
trek
where
plains
were
dim
and
and
worn
stern
vengeance
done
beth
huddled
by
the
poor
stiff
clay
of
him
she
loved
the
smoking
weapon
in
her
hand
to
scare
the
scavenger
of
carrion
brand
the
hours
crawled
by
soaked
through
with
thunder
rains
she
kept
her
vigil
loosening
her
hair
in
shining
masses
him
wild
refrains
of
piteous
croonings
and
of
vague
despair
crept
to
her
lips
then
died
away
unsung
hiding
their
tunes
her
shattered
dreams
among
jan
rissik
trekked
him
homeward
half
a
day
to
cellier
farmstead
more
the
patient
team
of
oxen
plodding
slowly
on
their
way
bent
to
the
nekstrop
huick
a
thin
sharp
gleam
of
curling
whip
flicked
at
the
leader
clean
sure
as
a
rapier
thrust
and
long
and
lean
the
voorlooper
strode
on
ahead
the
boys
marched
to
the
rhythm
of
a
chaunt
to
ease
their
work
the
wagon
lumbering
noise
the
cheering
of
the
oxen
stormed
the
haunt
of
nature
the
awning
broad
and
square
sat
rissik
vrouw
worn
with
maternal
care
her
children
nestled
round
her
two
hours
yet
the
dutchman
whistled
as
he
jogged
along
in
leisured
haste
he
licked
his
thick
lips
wet
to
loose
his
tune
a
heavy
winging
throng
of
gorging
vultures
black
as
devil
brood
rose
swearing
on
the
air
with
protests
crude
some
rotting
beast
jan
rissik
raised
his
eyes
to
watch
the
swart
aasvogel
b
in
their
flight
cracking
his
whip
to
dissipate
the
flies
that
swarmed
in
thousands
pestilential
right
where
his
oxen
wended
straight
in
front
he
clambered
from
his
seat
with
angry
grunt
and
pious
prayer
politely
blended
sure
the
powers
above
would
note
the
quoted
text
nor
heed
the
fact
that
while
he
prayed
he
swore
his
keen
eyes
swept
the
veld
grave
and
perplexed
two
mules
strayed
fettered
by
the
reim
outspanned
a
cart
unhitched
stuck
in
the
khaki
sand
jan
pulled
his
slouch
hat
down
and
stroked
his
beard
the
harsh
birds
croaked
the
dingy
clotted
brown
that
stained
the
earth
confirmed
the
tale
he
feared
a
woman
in
the
burning
dust
stooped
down
over
a
crumpled
figure
and
a
sheen
of
golden
tresses
veiled
it
like
a
screen
she
rocked
her
too
and
fro
a
little
breath
that
might
be
song
or
might
be
strangled
word
broke
from
her
now
and
then
but
only
death
lay
in
her
arms
and
answered
not
nor
heard
come
away
come
away
come
come
come
away
for
the
moon
for
the
moon
made
a
shroud
in
the
day
come
away
come
away
come
the
moon
the
flowers
are
calling
dick
my
love
come
soon
some
hundred
yards
pah
jan
felt
strangely
sick
must
have
dragged
that
fearful
thing
away
the
devil
brood
had
claimed
the
rooinek
was
safe
heaven
knew
how
desperate
the
fray
the
fierce
shot
spent
the
havoc
showed
too
well
her
awful
battle
with
those
fiends
from
hell
he
spoke
her
in
the
taal
he
touched
her
hand
she
scarcely
moved
but
with
a
smile
babbled
in
words
he
could
not
understand
nodding
her
head
towards
the
plains
the
while
the
other
one
is
dead
he
was
so
black
he
killed
my
husband
so
i
killed
him
back
i
want
to
lay
the
moonflowers
on
dick
breast
they
told
me
he
was
calling
so
i
came
they
kept
on
nodding
nodding
to
the
west
i
want
to
have
those
moonflowers
the
same
that
told
me
dick
is
dead
so
cold
and
dead
i
do
remember
all
the
flowers
said
but
if
we
are
not
very
quick
the
shroud
of
silver
woven
star
on
star
will
be
quite
stolen
by
the
it
creeping
creeping
growling
from
afar
ja
ja
the
old
boer
nodded
both
are
dead
one
must
be
buried
so
the
good
vrouw
said
they
laboured
hard
to
dig
the
white
man
bed
jan
rissik
and
his
trusty
man
and
boys
then
laid
him
gently
down
with
prayer
unsaid
but
beating
at
her
throat
no
word
that
cloys
or
mars
itself
in
speech
beth
flung
the
sod
over
her
love
and
left
him
there
with
god
only
a
dusty
mound
to
mark
his
grave
a
dream
a
tiny
buried
cross
from
off
her
neck
the
lord
had
called
who
gave
his
rich
acceptance
that
the
world
deems
loss

forgive
us
for
our
eyes
that
see
only
our
sorrows
when
we
should
see
thee

trekked
at

the

girl
lay
sleeping
in
his
cart
clasped
to
the
dutch
vrouw
breast
no
longer
torn
by
grief
and

human
fears
her
heart
was

at
rest

to
peace
her
