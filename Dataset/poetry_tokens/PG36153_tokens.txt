too

read
that

her
had

the
farewells

sadly
said

half
a
century

more
since
all

myriads
fell

he
was
one
of

who
cast
sweet

into

the

of
him
who
fought
not
for
renown
no
one
now
hears
a
spoken
word
but
on
the
monument
his
name
in
gold
is
lettered
with
the
rest
without
a
sordid
thought
of
fame
he
to

for
those
who
gave
us
a
country

for
the
dead
with

we
are
marking
their

hearts
are

this
our

pass
safe
through
peril

deadly
war
flowers
for
brave

flowers
for
those
who
loved
us
flowers
to
their
memory
this
fair
spring
day
from
top
to
pedestal
you
scan
it
lightly
capped
head
to
lettered
base
and
you
are
smiling
what
see
you
there
to
set
your
lips
an
awkward
figure
cut
from
ugly
granite
aye
roughly
hewn
as
if
unhelped
by
chisel
this
peaceful
man
of
war
sculptured
grotesquely
still
there
is
metal
in
the
gun
he
is
holding
and
in
the
cannon
balls
piled
up
before
him
the
artist
symbols
of
a
real
soldier
yet
jeer
no
longer
before
you
is
a
soldier
of
the
union
crowned
with
the
tears
and
prayers
of
many
mourners
the
village
set
him
here
for
all
to
honor
here
in
the
centre
of
their
common
where
on
long
summer
evenings
boys
at
baseball
may
gaze
and
gaze
and
make
him
an
example
a
hero
they
would
follow
beholding
him
i
see
no
granite
figure
but
face
a
man
who
fought
to
save
his
country
whose
heart
was
pierced
when
wife
and
child
and
mother
clung
to
him
closely
in
that
tearful
parting
yet
brave
he
marched
away
while
flags
were
fluttering
though
in
his
soul
he
knew
that
never
never
might
he
again
see
those
he
loved
so
dearly
nor
look
again
upon
the
old
white
steeple
upon
the
little
streets
and
shabby
buildings
straggling
unevenly
toward
the
common
or
if
he
came
back
he
be
maimed
and
battered
subject
to
hateful
pity
therefore
i
smile
not
at
the
queer
gaunt
figure
the
tilted
cap
the
wide
and
baggy
trousers
the
long
loose
overcoat
the
dangling
knapsack
this
is
the
man
who
fought
to
save
our
country
who
in
his
millions
marched
from
every
village
from
every
city
of
our
mighty
nation
who
heard
the
drums
and
trumpets
blithely
playing
tramp
tramp
tramp
the
boys
are
marching
so
there
it
stands
of
a
people
whether
of
stone
or
bronze
or
marble
proving
our
debt
to
those
who
saved
the
union
pointing
the
way
for
those
who
like
to
follow
who
to
the
death
would
fight

our

trod

fields

glory
the
tattered
flags
that
this
grand

bore
for

flags
that
furled
and
faded
to
their
old
vividness
our
hearts
restore
the
line
of
veterans
once
firm
and
crowded
the
long
long
line
is
wavering
and
thin
with
faltering
steps
old
age
speaks
mutely
to
them
youth
marched
abreast
when
they
were
mustered
in
oh
comrades
of
the
campfire
and
the
council
oh
comrades
who
in
peril
won
your
fight
honor
to
you
and
to
your
dead
companions
you
risked
your
all
for
liberty
and
right
fraternity
and
charity
your
watchwords
and
loyalty
to
this
our
own
dear
land
our
flag
you
have
the
brazen
star
the
eagle
undying
symbols
for
your
gallant
band
look
at
them
youths
and
maidens
as
they
pass
you
while
break
upon
the
air
and
staring
crowds
applaud
read
ye
the
message
that
from
the
past
these
veterans
nobly
bear
our
gift
the
gift
of
freedom
to
the
nation
our
great
republic
would
entrust
to
you
cherish
it
fondly
keeping
it
untarnished
that
in
the
future
looming
on
our
view
you
with
the
world
may
share
your
gift
of
freedom
this
is
the
message
that
our
youth
must
con
while
the
grand
army
answering
its
last
and
laying
down
life
weapons
passes
on
harvard
we
saw
the
regiment
alert
and
strong
in
marching
line
on
soldiers
field
today
ah
ready
they
to
battle
with
the
wrong
this
flower
of
youth
eager
and
brave
and
gay
and
we
cheered
them
as
they
passed
and
we
prayed
a
silent
prayer
gazing
upon
them
with
a
grim
forecast
and
many
a
mother
watched
them
there
proudly
they
turned
and
at
attention
stood
or
shouldered
arms
while
music
thrilled
alas
we
listened
in
unhappy
mood
why
should
these
boys
in
martial
ways
be
skilled
no
comfort
for
our
grieving
was
revealed
until
we
looked
across
the
valiant
line
to
the
old
college
far
beyond
this
field
that
honors
men
who
fell
at
freedom
shrine
oh
ancient
college
that
so
long
hast
bred
son
after
son
to
heed
his
country
call
the
answer
to
our
questionings
is
read
in
yonder
tower
of
your
memorial
hall
in
oh
the
noise
of
piccadilly
its
rumble
and
its
roar
a
tide
of
life
broad
ocean
surging
toward
the
shore
who
once
has
listened
ever
can
hear
its
long
refrain
with
haunting
echo
drowning
or
dirge
or
flaunting
strain
who
heeds
it
in
his
vision
may
see
a
pass
and
over
there
the
green
park
with
laughing
lad
and
lass
while
weary
men
and
women
and
careless
youth
go
by
where
windows
glow
and
glitter
and
in
the
evening
sky
a
crescent
moon
is
watching
the
laughing
lass
and
lad
the
long
warm
london
twilight
happy
they
are
though
sad
with
kiss
and
tear
they
are
parting
is
late
the
rush
and
roar
the
life
of
picadilly
is
waning
is
no
more
ah
the
dark
the
cold
the
stillness
of
the
trenches
in
the
night
where
freezing
men
are
crouching
in
the
lull
before
the
fight
then
for
one
the
calm
is
broken
by
the
rumble
and
the
roar
of
picadilly
and
in
dreams
as
oft
before
he
sees
her
who
wept
at
parting
what
was
that
a
whining
shell
once
a
man
that
huddled
horror
he
was
smiling
as
he
fell
summer
has
returned
to
london
now
the
green
park
gleams
anew
cheers
and
tears
together
mingle
but
the
breaking
heart
beats
true
blare
of
trumpet
blood
and
fire
so
her
hero
marched
away
happy
lad
and
lass
they
parted
now
the
pitying
sky
is
gray
blood
and
fire
through
its
heroes
shall
a
nation
live
again
blare
of
trumpet
but
in
silence
aching
hearts
must
bear
their
pain
ah
the
stillness
of
the
trenches
ah
the
rumble
and
the
roar
cheers
and
tears
by
england

for
the
lads
who
come

and
this
september
night
at

under
a

bursting
yellow
sheaves
upon
the
unbounded
prairie
lie
bread
bread
the
staff
and
stay
of
life
is
what
the
wheatlands
yield
but
only
death
and
agony
are
gathered
from
this
field
there
respite
now
but
ah
good
friend
before
another
day
although
our
bodies
may
be
here
we
we
how
far
away
we
ridden
many
a
weary
mile
together
we
have
fought
for
freedom
honor
and
the
right
and
anything
we
wrought
our
country
to
the
empire
will
still
more
closely
bind
ah
where
the
reddened
maple
leaf
is
fluttering
in
the
wind
there
is
my
heart
oh
noble
horse
and
may
we
gallop
free
some
day
again
in
canada
our
land
of
liberty
the
night
drags
on
toward
the
dawn
and
far
on
yonder
plain
i
hear
the
throb
of
musketry
i
feel
its
echoing
pain
i
see
the
breaking
and
nearer
than
their
flare
a
wreath
of
deadly
smoke
points
out
that
once
a
town
was
there
look
brother
horse
the
night
is
past
and
glorious
is
the
dawn
away
with
peril
we
ride
on
for
our
saskatchewan
with
day
comes
hope
and
though
again
the
sky
with
blood
is
red
we
ride
against
the
enemy
for
victory
lies
ahead
aye
for
the
empire
victory
that
thou
shalt
help
to
bring
and
for
the
allies
victory
on
earth
what
greater
thing
cry
of
the
a
new
year
dawning
on
a
warring
world
and
many
fight
and
many
pray
for
peace
but
yet
the
roar
of
battle
will
not
cease
still
man
against
his
brother
man
is
hurled
so
we
who
wait
we
women
in
our
woe
who
wait
and
work
who
wait
and
work
and
weep
for
us
there
is
no
rest
for
us
no
sleep
as
our
sad
thoughts
are
wandering
grim
and
slow
across
those
dreary
fields
where
far
away
our
hero
myriads
bleed
and
burn
and
die
we
lift
our
hearts
toward
the
pitying
sky
dawns
there
no
hope
upon
this
new
year
day
of
all
the
luckless
women
ever
born
or
ever
to
be
born
here
on
our
earth
most
pitied
be
cassandra
from
her
birth
condemned
to
woes
unearned
by
her
forlorn
she
early
read
great
ilium
doom
and
tried
her
countrymen
to
warn
but
she
apollo
passion
in
high
scorn
had
once
repelled
and
of
his
injured
pride
the
god
for
her
had
bred
this
punishment
that
good
or
bad
all
things
she
prophesied
though
true
as
truth
should
ever
be
decried
and
flouted
by
the
people
as
she
went
far
from
old
priam
gates
among
the
crowd
to
save
her
country
was
her
heart
intent
pure
fearless
on
an
holy
errand
bent
they
called
her
mad
who
was
a
princess
proud
alas
the
city
falls
beware
the
horse
woe
woe
the
greeks
ah
why
was
she
endowed
with
this
sad
gift
able
to
pierce
the
cloud
that
veils
the
future
in
its
wasting
course
she
could
not
stop
the
storm
bitter
the
pain
when
those
she
loved
and
trusted
weak
resource
her
prophecies
believed
not
when
the
force
of
all
her
pleading
spent
itself
in
vain
poor
maid
she
knew
no
greater
agony
when
dragged
a
slave
in
agamemnon
train
and
though
she
fell
by
clytemnestra
slain
she
smiled
on
death
who
eased
her
misery
for
oh
what
grief
to
one
of
faithful
heart
it
is
to
know
the
evils
that
must
be
helpless
their
doom
to
make
the
imperilled
see
unskilled
to
shield
them
from
the
fatal
dart
of
on
every
bush
are
roses
blooming
everywhere
the
nightingale
to
his
love
again
is
warbling
plaintively
his
tale
now
within
our
balmy
garden
dances
the
tall
cypress
tree
and
the
poplar
never
ceases
clapping
his
slim
hands
in
glee
from
the
height
of
every
you
can
hear
the
turtle
sing
with
loud
voice
proclaiming
gaily
the
glad
coming
of
the
spring
on
the
head
of
the
narcissus
gleams
as
bright
his
diadem
as
the
crown
of
china
emperor
decked
with
many
a
costly
gem
here
the
west
wind
there
the
north

in
true
token
of
their
love
at
the
feet
of
yonder
rose
lay
treasure
poured
down
from
above
all
the
earth
with
musk
is
scented
and
is
the
air
everything
proclaims
that
daily
now
draws
nearer
spring
the
fair
from
a
persian
and
death
after
life
shall
we
sigh
as
we
say
it
sigh
as
if
death
were
the
end
for
us
all
pale
at
the
thought
as
in
silence
we
weigh
it
yield
our
dull
souls

is
the
way

a

foeman
stole
far
from
the
haunted
pole
on
the
wide
sea
went
he
forth
and
he
met
a
giant
ship
as
he
scoured
the
sea
for
toll
it
can
not
reach
its
goal
crushed
in
his
icy
grip
of
every

just

this
was
his
deadly
dole
unseen
he
called
the
roll
ah
a
cold
grave
is
the
sea
yet
the
sea
is
not
the
end
and
life
is
not
the

heroic
soul
shall
eternity
extend
love

if
love
were
all
how
dark
the
world
what
sorrow
for
the
stricken
heart
if
love
were
all
with
love
grown
cold
no
tempest
raging
bleak
and
bold
its
icy
fury
ever
hurled
as
madly
as
the
storms
that
dart
across
the
soul
when
love
is
dead
poor
soul
on
bitter
passion
fed
seeing
in
earth
or
heaven
no
bliss
when
love
has
died
in
love
last
kiss
if
love
were
all
if
love
were
all
how
fair
the

what
joy
in

here
if
love
were

and
love
were

love
message
blown
on
every
wind
thrilling
the
soul
would
give
small
worth
to
cringing
caution
or
the
jeer
of
those
who
murmur
love
must
die
when
love
alight
from
eye
to
eye
life
is
a
happy
holiday
where
winter
ah
ever
may
if
love
were
all
that
it
be
love
i
dare
not
say
i
only
know
when
he
away
dark
as
the
night
so
dark
the
day
but
still
he
rove
and
still
i
try
some
light
to
see
in
yon
grim
sky
for
i
will
prove
if
power
there
be
to
lead
him
through
the
night
to
me
in
that
fair
constancy
little
ah
little
lake
though
fair
thou
art
a
sapphire
flashing
to
the
sky
thy
charm
is
only
for
the
eye
thy
beauty
can
not
hold
my
heart
green
bending
to
thy
shore
gleam
clear
in
the
autumnal
light
while
far
above
monadnock
height
keeps
rugged
guard
thy
waters
and
yet
these
very
beauties
cloy
as
in
a
prison
i
am
bound
though
fair
the
walls
that
gird
me
round
my
housemate
is
no
longer
joy
thy
loveliness
breeds
discontent
for
far
my
foolish
heart
would
be
it
longs
for
the
unquiet
sea
and
with
desire
is
sorely
rent
hateful
the
walls
that
me
debar
from
happier
things
that
haunt
me
so
even
my
weary
thoughts
are
slow
to
reach
the
great
great
world
afar
i
half
believe
there
is
no
world
those
cruel
there
beyond
oh
for
the
wizard
merlin
wand
that
all
these
mountain
curves
uncurled
i
might
behold
the
shore
i
love
might
hear
the
roaring
of
the
tide
might
see
the
ocean
reaching
wide
and
boundless
as
the
sky
above
one
hour
beside
that
beach
quick
throbbing
to
its
love
caress
would
yield
to
me
more
happiness
than
a
whole
here
could
teach
for
nearly
eighteen
years
upon
my
head
the
crown
of
empire
heavily
has
set
the
burden
on
my
shoulders
i
have
borne
of
an
estate
encumbered
far
and
wide
with
debts
i
had
to
pay
ah
everywhere
murmurs
revolts
or
wars
assailed
my
throne
now
quiet
comes
even
in
britain
here
the
most
disturbing
province
of
them
all
yet
i
must
go
the
profits
i
must
leave
to
others
to
enjoy
to
hold
with
ease
what
i
with
bitter
travail
have
obtained
peace
there
must
be
and
mutual
amity
the
one
support
to
hold
the
empire
firm
to
keep
the
glory
of
the
empire
bright
discord
would
be
the
ruin
of
the
pile
that
my
poor
hands
have
built
so
painfully
only
when
peace
prevails
may
we
behold
how
small
things
grow
to
greatness
now
i
die
and
all
the
issue
of
the
coming
days
i
leave
to
my
successor
and
my
son
though
he
has
been
a
cruel
son
to
me
bassanius
i
name
your
emperor
the
antoninus
who
long
tried
to
get
that
title
by
the
sword
who
sought
my
death
the
dangers
knowing
not
that
always
must
surround
a
diadem
forgetting
that
the
places
of
the
great
are
guarded
well
by
envy
and
by
fear
blind
is
ambition
for
it
can
not
see
that
though
a
sovereign
power
large
may
seem
to
others
by
himself
the
things
possessed
are
counted
small
enough
aye
small
they
for
titles
can
not
make
a
happy
man
while
his
thin
thread
of
life
must
waver
so
his
might
is
laid
upon
a
weak
support
so
men
may
point
to
me
and
say
a
man
who
once
was
all
things
in
this
world
yet
now
is
nothing
for
like
meaner
men
he
paid
his
debt
to
nature
his
exploits
he
left
behind
aye
friends
i
leave
my
deeds
for
you
to
register
reproach
or
praise
the
shadowing
pencil
of
oblivion
at
last
will
blot
and
yet
that
all
the
care
that
i
have
taken
for
the
general
good
may
bring
forth
happy
fruits
when
i
am
dust
this
would
i
make
my
one
my
last
request
assist
my
sons
with
counsel
and
with
aid
that
they
may
rule
according
to
the
law
and
you
obey
according
to
the
right
so
through
you
both
my
legions
and
my
sons
the
empire
shall
be
held
in
high
respect
and
then
the
dying
emperor
feebly
turned
toward
the
urn
wherein
so
soon
must
lie
his
ashes
and
he
cried
so
shalt
thou
hold
what
the
whole
world
one
time
could
not
contain
thus
died
severus
and
about
the
country
they
may
talk
who
will
who
praise
it
ever
to
the
town
despite
let
him
extol
the
charms
of
wood
and
hill
who
finds
them
peerless
none
disputes
his
right
for
me
the
town
each
footway
old
to
me
is
dearer
than
your
lane
not
all
who
struggle
here
contend
for
gold
things
quit
not
the
soul
of
pain
god
made
the
country
ay
and
god
made
man
working
through
man
his
power
he
displays
and
in
the
city
mazes
his
great
plan
is
writ
as
clear
as
in
calm
country
ways
antæus
as
the
ancient
poets
sing
though
in
his
contest
with
the
god
of
power
doomed
to
be
conquered
stayed
the
fatal
hour
and
the
onlookers
set
to
wondering
for
overborne
to
earth
he
closely
cling
until
he
rose
again
a
mighty
tower
thus
could
the
earth
with
strength
her
lover
dower
and
very
near
to
victory
could
bring
so
when
i
feel
thy
tender
hand
in
mine
i
too
dear
love
against
the
world
could
stand
courage
divine
comes
with
thy
lightest
touch
afar
from
thee
i
pine
but
strength
returns
now
as
i
clasp
thy
hand
ah
that
so
slight
a
thing
should
mean
so
much
here
where
the
proud
hibiscus
blooms
in
flame
where
swaying
palms
nod
lightly
to
the
sea
where
each
azalea
towers
a
stately
tree
and
orange
blossoms
charm
today
i
came
upon
a
little
flower
unknown
to
fame
half
hid
in
the
scant
sward
white
as
this
shell
from
yonder
beach
and
i
can
hardly
tell
what
drew
me
to
it
murmuring
its
name
bred
in
cool
meadows
vagrant
from
the
north
fair
dewberry
what
art
thou
doing
here
or
chance
or
purpose
started
thee
to
roam
and
yet
whatever
power
sent
thee
forth
still
it
is
thine
to
call
the
sudden
tear
to
stir
the
trembling
heart
with
thoughts
of
home
who
then
is
rich
who
poor
i
tell
you
now
of
one
a
meagre
life
who
had
to
live
wear
dingy
garb
and
scarcely
could
allow
himself
what
men
call
comfort
yet
to
give
was
his
delight
to
give
though
fate
had
hampered
him
he
always
knew
some
one
still
poorer
in
humility
he
thus
gave
hope
to
him
who
had
small
view
of
happier
things
solace
to
him
who
wept
and
to
the
beaten
courage
to
endure
he
shared
his
little
with
the
starved
and
kept
his
best
for
those
who
needed
most
though
poor
by
giving
he
grew
richer
day
by
day
in
all
that
brightens
life
uncertain
way
there
was
another
who
had
never
known
a
wish
unsatisfied
for
everything
that
luxury
could
offer
was
his
own
thus
all
that
learning
all
that
wealth
could
bring
adorned
his
life
the
many
him
would
praise
for
this
world
loves
the
prosperous
and
still
close
to
himself
he
hugged
his
all
to
raise
a
helping
hand
he
never
had
the
will
he
never
heard
the
cries
of
men
in
need
of
all
he
had
he
would
not
give
a
part
for
i
and
mine
was
ever
his
one
creed
no
balm
had
he
for
any
aching
heart
mean
was
his
life
as
was
the
other
great
despite
the
splendor
of
his
high
estate
and
now
in
yonder
world
i
wonder
which
for
both
are
dead
is
counted
poor
or
rich
blessed
they
loved
life
even
as
we
who
went
away
from
their
dear
to
one
unknown
to
us
who
linger
here
they
could
not
stay
nor
we
go
with
them
so
they
went
alone
although
their
beating
hearts
with
ours
kept
time
although
their
clinging
hands
we
fondly
held
we
could
not
walk
the
path
they
had
to
climb
hardly
we
heard
the
when
it
knelled
trustful
or
fearful
of
the
way
ahead
they
had
to
journey
from
this
throbbing
life
and
we
we
know
they
are
the
blessed
dead
for
they
have
gone
away
from
pain
and
strife
we
can
not
see
the
land
where
they
have
gone
our
eyes
are
dim
and
they
are
hid
in
light
but
we
are
following
them
toward
the
dawn
who
knows
when
it
will
break
upon
our
sight
crinkled
twinkling
in
the
sun
splashed
by
midday
showers
dripping
cold
serrate
silvered
by
the
sun
that
has
brushed
yon
dull
brown
grass
with
gold
green
and
crinkled
oak
leaves
tremble
now
strong
you
would
be
strong
would
be
and
bold
ah
green
you
are
trembling
now
by
the
saucy
wind
deceived
cajoled
trembling
oak
leaves
you
are
soon
to
fall
soon
to
hide
the
earth
with
yellowing
mould
twinkling
crinkling
soon
you
fall
for
the
autumn
sun
is
shining
cold
well
satisfied
with
all
his
own
he
stands
holding
a
trembling
balance
in
his
hands
on
one
scale
wealth
and
ease
men
praises
too
whatever
charms
the
soul
and
keeps
it
true
but
on
the
other
scale
lo
the
foul
street
where
pallid
children
play
where
poor
folk
greet
and
crowded
houses
dirty
dimly
lit
on
whose
dull
walls
all
misery
is
writ
houses
wherein
the
herded
can
not
fight
the
ambushed
evil
lurking
day
and
night
has
he
contented
one
who
counts
his
gain
balanced
the
cost
the
wretchedness
and
pain
of
those
who
help
him
hoard
his
heap
of
gold
ah
human
life
may
be
too
dearly
sold
for
see
the
one
scale
weighs
the
other
down
his
gold
his
ease
his
honors
by
heaven
frown
withered
to
nothing
now
behold
he
stands
broken
his
scales
reaching
imploring
hands
companioned
by
the
lonely
hours
my
vigil
with
the
stars
i
keep
the
happy
stars
that
never

the
wakeful
stars

what

an
arrow
from

who
can
read
his
fate
for

he
carols
like
a
seraph
bound
for
a
radiant
star
mayhap
the

relentless

doomed
him

grovelling
closer

the

for
us
both
spring
early
flowers

fair
or

cold
stars
gleam
through
the
frosty
air
but
in
the
world
of
dreams
i
rove
over
sunny
fields
or
in
shaded
grove
such
beauty
your
eyes
never
saw
and
all
is
mine
without
let
or
law
ah
the
hopes
and
fears
that
come
and
go
with
my
flying

kill

if
it
lay
there
dead
ah
rather
let
it
live
a
second
cried
weed
it
may
be
and
yet
it
has
its
use
here
in
its
healing
essence
its
excuse
for
blooming
lies
and
here
its
only
pride
destroy

behold
this

lighter
verse
today
i
had
the
awfulest
time
dear
mother
in
the
wood
that
hill
out
there
we
were
to
climb
and
we
been
very
good
but
nurse
was
walking
up
the
hill
when
little
anne
and
i
we
had
to
stop
and
stand
quite
still
and
anne
began
to
cry
for
something
moved
behind
the
trees
we
felt
so
all
alone
said
i
to
anne
stop
crying
please
i
hit
it
with
a
stone
cried
anne
oh
listen
hear
it
growl
said
i
i
not
afraid
of
bears
or
lions
now
do
scowl
you
look
so
cross
she
said
so
then
i
had
to
smile
and
smile
for
anne
was
crying
all
the
while
and
if
we
did
a
bear
i
sure
dear
mother
one
was
there
boys
always
must
take
care
of
girls
you
see
you
told
me
so
that
why
i
tried
to
pat
anne
curls
and
walked
with
her
real
slow
but
when
we
heard
nurse
calling
out
come
children
come
along
come
nurse
you
should
have
heard
me
shout
anne
says
my
voice
is
strong
run
anne
i
cried
i
almost
five
and
i
kill
any
bear
alive
and
if
we
did
a
bear
i
truly
think
that
one
was
there
how
glad
i
was
when
nurse
turn
round
for
everything
seemed
queer
the
trees
looked
strange
and
then
that
sound
we
did
like
to
hear
nurse
laughed
when
we
had
told
her
all
about
the
bear
we
saw
i
came
as
quick
i
heard
you
call
and
it
against
the
law
for
bears
to
live
where
people
stay
they
are
five
hundred
miles
away
but
if
we
did
a
bear
i
sure
that
one
was
there
christmas
i
always
glad
when
christmas
comes
and
yet
i
like
it
better
if
mother
would
bother
me
to
write
a
christmas
letter
to
uncle
john
and
cousin
kate
and
dear
old
gray
and
all
whose
presents
come
to
me
from
places
far
away
of
course
i
love
my
presents
and
if
givers
should
forget
her
no
little
girl
my
mother
says
need
write
a
christmas
letter
for
oh
my
ink
makes
awful
blots
though
i
try
to
do
real
well
and
when
you
write
them
out
of
school
all
words
are
hard
to
spell
i
mean
to
mind
my
mother
she
so
kind
i
would
not
fret
her
but
when
she
says
stop
playing
dear
come
write
this
christmas
letter
that
just
the
thing
i
hate
to
hear
and
if
i
dared
i
remember
how
to
hold
a
pen
i
make
believe
i
could
my
auntie
has
a
camera
and
when
i
out
at
play
and
see
her
coming
with
it
i
try
to
hide
away
for
oh
it
is
so
bothersome
to
hear
her
with
a
laugh
call
stand
just
were
you
are
dear
i
take
a
photograph
sometimes
an
angry
lion
i
have
just
begun
to
roar
and
all
the
children
run
from
me
to
sneak
behind
the
door
when
auntie
to
our
forest
comes
why
does
she
stop
our
fun
i
like
to
shoot
that
camera
there
with
my
wooden
gun
perhaps
a
fire
engine
i
am
rushing
to
a
fire
while
people
loudly
call
for
help
as
flames
rise
higher
and
higher
i
hurry
toward
the
hydrant
here
for
oh
the
flames
are
hot
when
auntie
with
her
camera
cries
what
a
fine
snapshot
but
then
it
does
seem
to
snap
so
i
must
be
polite
and
when
she
says
oh
please
stand
still
the
sun
is
not
just
right
i
have
to
pull
up
where
i
am
and
see
that
house
burn
down
for
auntie
does
understand
even
when
i
twist
and
frown
she
only
says
do
squirm
my
pet
oh
what
a
cunning
pose
your
scowl
is
better
than
a
smile
so
that
the
way
it
goes
a
or
an
admiral
no
matter
what
i
am
i
have
to
face
that
camera
as
quiet
as
a
lamb
oh
it
is
little
margery
who
has
a
wherein
grow
purple
pansies
and
geraniums
white
and
red
with
feverfew
and
dahlias
and
delicate
pink
phlox
and
grandmother
fair
favorites
hollyhocks
one
night
we
feared
jack
frost
might
come
to
blight
the
tender
flowers
we
almost
felt
his
cruel
breath
in
the
early
evening
hours
so
margery
took
coverings
and
spread
them
thick
and
warm
to
shield
the
flowers
as
blankets
wrap
a
sleeping
baby
form
then
in
the
morning
when
we
looked
across
the
dewy
grass
and
saw
the
traces
jack
frost
leaves
where
he
is
wont
to
pass
for
each
spreading
tree
and
slender
bush
had
felt
his
chill
caress
and
some
had
drooped
and
some
had
blushed
in
crimson
loveliness
we
hastened
to
the
and
there
in
bright
array
the
little
flowers
looked
blithely
up
to
greet
the
smiling
day
safe
hid
from
jack
frost
piercing
breath
he
never
saw
them
there
and
the
flowers
still
bloom
for
margery
to
thank
her
for
her
care
i
knew
a
little
boy
not
very
long
ago
who
was
as
bright
and
happy
as
any
boy
you
know
he
had
an
only
fault
and
you
will
all
agree
that
from
a
fault
like
this
a
boy
himself
might
free
i
wonder
who
is
there
oh
see
now
why
is
this
and
oh
where
are
they
going
and
tell
me
what
it
is
ah
which
and
why
and
who
and
what
and
where
and
when
we
often
wished
that
never
need
we
hear
those
words
again
he
seldom
stopped
to
think
he
almost
always
knew
the
answer
to
the
questions
that
around
the
world
he
threw
to
children
seeking
knowledge
a
quick
reply
we
give
but
answering
what
he
asked
was
pouring
water
through
a
sieve
yet
you
admit
his
fate
was
as
sad
as
it
was
strange
our
eyes
we
hardly
trusted
who
slowly
saw
him
change
more
curious
grew
his
head
stemlike
his
limbs
and
hark
he
was
at
last
a
mere
first
i
sure
i
did
not
break
this
cup
it
just
fell
down
i
know
it
did
for
i
was
only
climbing
up
do
they
keep
the
hid
i
wanted
such
a
little
bit
and
then
i
heard
that
creaking
door
i
ca
tell
what
it
was
i
hit
nor
how
that
cup
got
on
the
floor
the
shelf
it
stood
on
was
too
high
that
cup
my
mother
loved
the
most
oh
dear
i
never
told
a
lie
and
mother
whispered
do
not
boast
the
day
i
said
i
never
could
but
there
that
broken
cup
and
then
i
promised
that
i
never
would
so
i
not
tell
a
lie
you
are
the
loveliest
parasol
i
ever
saw
and
all
my
own
what
frilly
frills
i
feel
as
tall
as
mother
now
here
take
my
doll
dolls
are
for
children
ladies
grown
have
parasols
and
fans
and
rings
and
all
those
pretty
shiny
things
nurse
calls
you
sunshade
but
i
think
that
is
too
plain
a
word
for
see
you
are
so
satiny
and
pink
and
there
is
such
a
curly
kink
here
in
your
handle
there
could
be
no
name
too
fine
i
love
you
so
i
take
you
everywhere
i
go
next
sunday
when
to
church
i
walk
above
my
head
i
hold
you
high
oh
how
the
other
girls
will
talk
and
maybe
some
of
them
will
mock
how
proud
she
feels
as
i
pass
by
i
hold
you
up
straight
down
the
aisle
if
only
people
would
smile
modern
i
want
to
see
a
grandmother
like
those
there
used
to
be
in
a
cosy
little
where
i
could
go
to
tea
a
grandmother
with
spectacles
and
a
funny
frilly
cap
who
would
make
me
sugar
cookies
and
take
me
on
her
lap
and
tell
me
lots
of
stories
of
the
days
when
she
was
small
when
everything
was
perfect
not
like
today
at
all
my
grandmother
is
grandma
and
she
lives
in
a
hotel
and
when
they
ask
what
is
his
age
she
smiles
and
will
not
tell
says
she
does
care
to
realize
that
she
is
growing
old
then
whispers
but
you
far
too
big
a
boy
for
me
to
hold
her
dresses
shine
and
rustle
and
her
hair
is
wavy
brown
and
she
has
an
automobile
that
she
steers
herself
down
town
my
grandmother
is
pretty
do
i
love
her
rather
yes
our
norah
calls
her
stylish
and
on
the
whole
i
guess
she
better
than
the
other
kind
for
once
when
i
was
ill
she
helped
my
mother
nurse
me
and
read
to
me
until
i
fell
asleep
and
stayed
with
me
and
was
tired
and
then
she
played
nine
holes
of
golf
with
me
when
i
got
out
again
yet
because
i
never
seen
one
just
once
i
want
to
see
a
real
grandmother
like
those
there
used
to
be
for
the
he
has
a
taste
that
superfine
who
flouts
at
every
subway
sign
he
reckons
not
that
some
there
be
who
can
not
tell
unless
they
see
spelled
plain
before
them
on
the
wall
what
things
their
own
they
ought
to
call
for
instance
when
i
come
to
town
whom
you
may
dub
a
country
clown
how
should
i
know
what
things
to
buy
if
not
a
subway
sign
were
nigh
to
show
the
pills
i
ought
to
take
my
thirst
to
slake
the
hair
restorer
that
will
soothe
my
infant
son
with
his
first
tooth
the
ruddy
catsup
that
is
sure
all
family
jars
and
ills
to
cure
the
dollar
watch
that
daintily
we
serve
for
early
tea
the
that
will
not
hide
our
failings
from
the
what
is
our
true
friend
the
dime
cigars
that
i
should
send
my
wife
to
cure
her
racking
cough
the
hooks
and
eyes
that
wo
come
off
ah
hats
and
soaps
and
and
cocoa
that
we
need
not
boil
and
suits
and
patent
soup
and
but
what
a
dupe
of
every
city
tradesman
i
if
all
these
vendibles
i
try
to
purchase
by
my
native
wit
yet
what
the
subway
best
has
writ
in
flaming
words
with
weird
device
that
make
i
mine
and
pay
the
price
when
your
father
long
ago
tried
to
train
you
and
you
know
he
thought
mornings
meant
for
school
and
not
for
swimming
how
your
heart
beat
loud
in
dread
as
relentlessly
he
said
you
when
you
had
another
trimming
when
your
daughter
buys
a
hat
and
you
wondering
thereat
as
before
the
glass
she
stands
its
beauty
hymning
ah
the
mischief
in
her
eyes
as
she
pleads
show
no
surprise
at
the
one
has
to
pay
for
when
the
butcher
brings
your
bill
and
you
stare
at
it
until
your
tongue
with
fervid
words
is
fairly
brimming
then
you
hear
him
meekly
say
as
your
anger
you
display
it
seems
high
because
there
so
much
in
trimming
so
when
politicians
try
your
votes
to
beg
or
buy
with
their
sophistry
your
common
sense
that
dimming
just
then
the
and
the
should
all
be
lost
of
the
wordy
trimmer
stone
walls
do
not
a
prison
make
nor
iron
bars
a
cage
high
halls
do
not
a
college
make
nor
shelves
a
sage
so
might
i
follow
haltingly
these
olden
words
to
show
that
even
in
this
newer
home
the
annex
may
not
know
a
greater
zeal
for
learning
than
the
old
house
could
bestow
but
comparisons
are
odious
so
i
merely
try
to
say
that
cherished
deep
within
the
hearts
of
many
here
today
is
the
memory
of
that
early
home
in
the
classic
appian
way
there
first
did
the
young
annex
whose
real
christian
name
contains
as
many
syllables
as
it
has
liens
on
fame
win
laurels
even
brighter
than
its
friends
had
hoped
to
claim
and
there
too
in
their
search
for
intellectual
recreation
its
students
formed
the
way
of
which
this
later
club
is
but
an
idler
imitation
just
where
the
interloper
dwelt
was
long
a
mystery
in
the
past
to
harvard
students
and
to
townsmen
equally
till
they
cried
there
is
no
annex
believe
we
only
what
we
see
now
the
annex
and
its
mission
every
year
are
better
known
from
the
smallest
of
beginnings
strong
and
powerful
it
has
grown
only
harvard
freshmen
speak
of
it
in
supercilious
tone
although
custom
would
forbid
us
as
we
are
passing
near
to
salute
the
ancient
building
with
a
rousing
annex
cheer
we
need
no
sign
like
this
to
prove
that
still
we
hold
it
dear
now
the
students
who
have
profited
by
their
foreseeing
care
fondly
thank
the
annex
founders
who
knew
not
the
word
despair
its
best
home
was
the
hearts
of
those
who
planned
the
structure
fair
at
a
college
liberty
a
liberty
bond
what
a
queer
contradiction
although
truth
as
you
heard
may
be
stranger
than
fiction
for
liberty
should
from
all
fetters
release
us
while
bonds
hold
one
fast
whether
pauper
or
croesus
yet
a
liberty
bond
i
advise
you
to
buy
it
will
ensure
you
your
freedom
you
see
when
you
try
it
aid
you
to
conquer
foes
cruel
despotic
help
save
your
country
come
be
patriotic
a
liberty
bond
i
advise
you
to
buy
one
will
ensure
you
your
freedom
rejoice
when
you
try
one
like
many
another
i
have
crossed
oftener
than
once
the
broad
atlantic
and
feeling
qualms
when
have
shuddered
at
the
waves
gigantic
fearing
that
really
nevermore
i
find
myself
again
ashore
then
when
upset
and
scarce
awake
in
moments
of
perturbed
reflection
my
wandering
thoughts
would
slowly
take
time
and
again
the
same
direction
i
think
of
that
adventurous
man
who
crossed
the
sea
first
of
my
clan
is
not
for
me
to
hope
to
find
upon
my
family
tree
broad
branches
ancestors
wholly
to
my
mind
i
know
that
i
am
taking
chances
in
digging
them
up
from
the
past
to
deck
this
hardy
tree
at
last
indeed
i
would
not
waste
my
breath
and
even
less
my
ink
and
paper
to
prove

they

such

to
me
are

none

his

when
he
for

set
out

with

a

his

was
on

comforts

billows
were

sat
upon

prow
just
where

he
hardly
knew
when
waves
he
tossed
on
while
my
woes
at

efface
by
merely
murmuring
home
is
boston
yet
he
had
left
his
all
behind
in
the
new

his
all
to
find
just
how
we

more
clearly
pointed
out
the
praise
of
him
who
after
africa
was
conquered
acquired
a
name
than
did
the
calabrian
lays
and
you
would
lose
if
writings
should
be
silent
the
price
of
all
that
you
so
well
have
done
and
romulus
his
fame
had
envy
silenced
where
had
he
been
great
mars
and
ilia
son
æacus
rescued
from
the
stygian
waters
the
genius
the
favor
and
the
tongue
of
mighty
bards
sent
to
the
blessed
islands
he
can
not

whose
praise

the

tireless

thaliarchus
you
see
how
our
soracte
now
is
standing
hoary
with
heavy
snow
and
now
its
weight
to
bear
the
struggling
woods
are
hardly
able
and
with
the
bitter
cold
the
streams
stagnate
the
cold
melt
thou
away
oh
thaliarchus
by
heaping
logs
upon
thy
fire
again
replenishing
and
from
a
sabine
flagon
wine
of
a
four
years
vintage
draw
thou
then
leave
to
the
gods
the
rest
for
at
the
moment
they
felled
the
winds
upon
the
boiling
sea
that
battled
fiercely
then
there
was
not
stirring
or
or
ancient
cypress
tree
cease
thou
to
ask
what
is
to
be
the
day
that
fortune
gives
score
thou
as
gain
as
when
a
boy
thou
shalt
not
scorn
love
sweetness
nor
smoothly
moving
dancers
shalt
disdain
while
crabbed
age
from
thy
fresh
youth
is
distant
now
in
the
field
and
in
the
public
square
all
the
soft
whisperings
that
come
at
shall
at
the
trysting
be
repeated
there
now
too
the
tempting
laugh
from
a
far
corner
that
must
the
maiden
lurking
there
betray
also
the
pledge
that
she
in
feigned
resistance
lets
from
her
arm
or
hand
be
taken
away
chloe
ah
chloe
like
a
fawn
you
now
elude
me
seeking
its
timid
dam
on
lonely
hills
its
dam
who
not
without
an
idle
tremor
at
breezes
in
the
forest
thrills
for
if
before
the
breeze
the
bushes
quiver
with
rustling
leaves
or
if
green
lizards
start
across
the
bramble
then
it
is
it
trembles
this
little
fawn
in
knees
and
heart
but
chloe
i
am
not
a
cruel
tiger
nor
a
gætulian
lion
thee
to
chase
and
now
that
thou
art
old
enough
to
marry
beside
thy
mother
take
thy
place
fuscus
oh
fuscus
he
whose
life
is
pure
and
upright
wants
not
the
moorish
javelin
nor
the
bow
nor
may
he
need
the
quiver
heavy
laden
with
arrows
poisoned
for
the
lurking
foe
whether
he
is
about
to
make
a
journey
to
sultry
libya
or
the
unfriendly
height
of
caucasus
or
to
the
distant
places
that
famed
hydaspes
washes
in
his
flight
for
lately
me
a
wolf
fled
in
the
forest
the
sabine
forest
as
my
lalage
i
sang
about
beyond
my
boundaries
wandering
unarmed
the
creature
fled
from
me
apulia
land
of
soldiers
never
nourished
in
her
broad
woods
a
monster
of
such
girth
nor
mauritania
arid
nurse
of
lions
to
such
a
one
has
ever
given
birth
ah
put
me
on
those
plains
remote
and
barren
where
not
a
tree
can
feel
the
summer
wind
and
grow
again
a
land
of
mist
eternal
whereover
jupiter
still
broods
unkind
or
place
me
in
that
land
denied
man
dwelling
too
near
the
chariot
of
the
sun
above
still
my
own
lalage
so
sweetly
smiling
my
lalage
i
love
venus
lately
was
i
to
gentle
maidens
suited
and
not
without
some
glory
did
contend
but
now
my
weapons
and
my
lute
made
useless
for
contests
on
this
wall
i
will
suspend
that
guards
the
left
side
of
our
venus
here
here
place
you
my
gleaming
waxen
torch
my
levers
and
my
that
can
threaten
the
doors
that
ought
to
open
on
this
porch
oh
goddess
thou
who
blessed
cyprus
rulest
and
memphis
ever
lacking
thracian
snow
my
queen
in
passing
with
thy
whip
uplifted
give
to
my
haughty
chloe
just
one
blow
palinode
oh
daughter
lovelier
than
your
lovely
mother
whatever
punishment
you
may
desire
give
my
offending
verses
in
the
fire
throw
them
please
you
or
in
the
adriatic
not
dindymene
no
nor
even
apollo
so
shakes
the
minds
of
priests
within
the
shrine
nor
so
disturbing
is
the
god
of
wine
nor
corybantes
doubling
their
shrill
cymbals
as
direful
fits
of
anger
that
are
frightened
neither
by
noric
sword
nor
savage
flame
nor
by
seas
nor
them
can
tame
great
jupiter
himself
with
all
his
thunders
to
our
original
clay
they
say
prometheus
was
forced
to
add
a
portion
he
had
made
of
bits
from
every
creature
and
he
laid
in
human
hearts
rage
from
the
furious
lion
with
crushing
ruin
rage
destroyed
thyestes
and
as
a
final
cause
rage
may
be
known
why
mighty
cities
fell
quite
overthrown
and
why
upon
their
walls
a
sneering
army
its
plowshare
drags
along
but
keep
your
temper
me
too
in
my
sweet
youth
a
frenzied
heart
has
tempted
sorely
and
its
maddening
dart
has
driven
me
to
write
impetuous
verses
to
change
sad
things
for
brighter
i
am
seeking
and
since
my
offending
verses
i
retract
i
beg
of
you
in
turn
a
friendly
act
that
you
again
to
me
your
heart
give
over
fame
a
monument
outlasting
brass
i
have
builded
higher
than
pyramids
in
their
crumbling
glory
that
no
devouring
storm
nor
futile
north
wind
can
overthrow
nor
years
in
long
succession
nor
fleeting
seasons
i
shall
not
wholly
perish
in
great
part
i
escape
the
funeral
pyre
and
lately
praised
my
praise
will
go
on
growing
to
latest
years
as
long
as
priest
and
vestal
ascend
the
capitol
i
shall
be
mentioned
where
aufidus
fierce
rages
and
where
daunus
a
rustic
race
rules
in
an
arid
country
great
though
of
humble
birth
i
the
first
poet
to
write
in
latin
rhythms
æolian
lyrics
take
pride
melpomene
in
merits
and
crown
me
willingly
with
delphic
laurel
god
mean
and
careless
servant
while
i
wander
deep
in
the
madness
of
philosophy
now
backward
i
must
set
my
sail
and
ponder
where
my
forsaken
course
retraced
shall
be
for
jupiter
who
with
his
glittering
fire
so
often
cleaves
apart
the
threatening
clouds
his
wingèd
car
and
thundering
horses
higher
toward
air
has
driven
where
no
shadow
shrouds
whereat
the
sluggish
earth
each
vagrant
river
the
styx
and
hated
tænarus
dread
abode
and
the
atlantic
borders
shake
and
shiver
ah
to
reverse
high
things
and
low
our
god
is
able
and
the
mighty
he
can
lower
the
obscure
can
raise
from
this
man

steals
the
crown
to
give
to
that
one
in
her
power
showing
with
hissing
wings
the
joy
she
feels
