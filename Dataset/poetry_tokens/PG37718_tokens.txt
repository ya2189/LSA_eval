foreword
elias
was
begun
in
the
spring
of
and
was
first
published
in
the
autumn
of
when
an
edition
de
luxe
limited
to
one
hundred
and
fifty
copies
and
two
less
pretentious
editions
were
subscribed
for
by
friends
of
the
author
he
was
hardly
a
party
to
the
project
the
initial
step
being
taken
without
his
knowledge
prior
to
that
time
he
had
read
the
poem
to
select
gatherings
in
private
homes
and
in
two
of
the
leading
church
schools
but
had
no
thought
of
printing
it
so
early
until
solicited
by
a
committee
of
prominent
citizens
to
allow
them
to
undertake
in
his
behalf
its
publication
that
committee
consisted
of
governor
heber
wells
senator
george
sutherland
president
anthon
lund
major
richard
young
and
culmer
these
gentlemen
out
of
pure
public
spirit
and
a
friendly
feeling
for
the
author
had
associated
themselves
together
for
this
purpose
though
aware
of
many
defects
in
his
work
and
anxious
to
mend
them
before
facing
the
public
and
the
critics
he
nevertheless
accepted
gratefully
the
very
generous
offer
all
the
members
of
the
committee
gave
to
the
enterprise
their
hearty
support
and
two
of
them
major
young
and
culmer
conducted
most
of
the
business
necessary
to
putting
the
book
through
the
press
since
the
original
issuance
the
author
has
endeavored
to
bring
the
work
into
a
more
finished
state
and
the
results
are
now
before
the
reader
the
poem
is
in
twelve
parts
a
prelude
ten
cantos
and
an
epilogue
following
these
are
explanatory
notes
for
the
benefit
of
students
the
introduction
of
the
epic
as
a
text
book
into
the
schools
being
one
of
the
purposes
for
which
it
was
written
the
character
and
scope
of
the
work
are
partly
indicated
by
the
title
elias
an
epic
of
the
ages
it
is
an
attempt
to
present
in
verse
form
historically
doctrinally
and
prophetically
the
vast
theme
comprehended
in
what
the
world
terms
mormonism

was
to
come
to

together
the
tribes
of
israel
and
restore
all
things
argument
the
aim
of
this
poem
is
to
point
out
those
manifestations
of
the
divine
mind
and
those
impulsions
from
human
enterprise
which
have
contributed
in
all
ages
to
the
progress
of
the
race
toward
perfection
thus
it
deals
not
only
with
man
origin
and
destiny
with
creation
redemption
and
ultimate
glorification
but
with
events
and
epochs
leading
up
to
and
having
those
greater
ends
as
their
decreed
consummation
the
christ
theme
in
its
heavenly
and
earthly
phases
is
supplemented
by
the
sacred
and
secular
history
of
man
upon
both
hemispheres
god
direct
dealings
through
prophets
apostles
and
other
inspired
agents
and
his
indirect
dealings
through
poets
painters
philosophers
inventors
discoverers
statesmen
kings
conquerors
and
the
like
are
indicated
and
the
experiences
of
the
church
of
christ
in
various
dispensations

and

workings

of
the
infinite

through

aeons
and
the
ages
behind
the
scenes
and
upon
the
stage
of
human
action

the
warp
and

of
the
entire
poem
the

point
is
the
dispensation
of
the
fulness
of
times
the
era
of
restitution
when
the

morn

i

dream
splendid
as
springtime
weft
of
wonders
rare
idyllic
vision
beauteous
bright
romance
glory
of
love
and
glamor
of
renown
i
dreamed
that
fame
held
all

the
sweet
charm
that
lurked
in
woman
smile
wealth
wooed
i
not
nor
power
to
wear
the
sign

the
symbol
of
authority
to
speak
and
have
hosts
tremble
or
to
frown
and
find
all
pale
and
prostrate
at
my
feet
but
oh
to
sway
like
swinging
forest
boughs
in
summer
breeze
men
yearning
hearts
and
minds
sway
them
in
duty
name
in
virtue
cause
by
tongue
of
thunder
or
by
pen
of
flame
leaving
some
wise
sublime
benefic
deed
some
word
or
work
of
merit
and
of
might
to
fix
the
fleeting
gaze
of
centuries

and

were
my
guides

passions
of
my

the
baal
and

whom
i
bowed
at
human
shrines
a
worldly
worshiper
adoring
beauteous
dust
my
fellow
clay
and
coveting
an
earthly
immortality
and
at
the
feet
of
these
dear
deities
careless
of
great
jehovah
smile
or
frown
in
the
fresh
morning
of
my
youth
fair
might
slumbering
i
dreamed
till
golden
grew
the
dawn
a
strange
and
stern
awakening
a
sky
pearl
gold
and
sapphire
clear
and
calm
till
then
grim
with
anger
audible
tortured
and
torn
with
darts
of
fire
booming
and
crashing
bolt
on
bolt
descends
earth
air
and
heaven
are
wrapt
in
roaring
flame
and
when
the
rifted
storm
has
rolled
away
and
stillness
reascends
her
solemn
throne
ruin
looks
forth
from
retrospection
tower
and
memory
weeps
where
desolation
reigns
it
was
the
end
dispelled
illusion
dream
youth
fond
ideals
strewn
lay
level
with
the
dust
but
light
had
come
my
soul
had
cast
its
fetters
and
was
free
i
slept
and
dreamed
no
more
i
was
awake
and
saw
and
heard
with
other
eyes
and
ears
which
taught
me
things
unseen
unheard
before
things
new
yet
old
old
as
eternity
old
to
time
though
new
and
strange
to
me
i
talked
with
truth
on
solemn
mountain
tops
i
soared
with
winged
thought
the
sunlit
dome
studied
the
midnight
stars
and
when
anon
the
hurrying
legions
of
the
storm
in
supermortal
might
went
forth
to
war
would
fain
have
charioted
the
charging
plain
or
spurred
the
tempest
as
a
battle
steed
grasping
the
volted
lightnings
as
they
flew
and
thundering
through
the
mists
on
things
below
rejoicing
in
my
strength
i
gave
glory
to
him
the
source
and
sire
of
all
that
god
whom
i
had
neither
loved
nor
feared
that
god
whom
now
i
worshipt
and
adored
who
girdled
me
with
light
truth
triple
key
unlocking
what
hath
been
what
yet
shall
be
probing
death
gloom
life
mystery
solving
the
secret
whither
whence
and
why
oh
wondrous
transformation
when
with
wand
of
wakening
might
that
power
waved
the
cross
where
hung
fond
hopes
impaled
waved
the
tomb
where
loved
ambitions
lay
touched
the
strewn
fragments
of
my
shattered
dream

the
dead
arise
in

made

could
see
what
then
i
saw
whose
ear
such
harmonies
could
hear
when
the
spirit
tore
the
veil
of
things
that
seem
and
showed
me
things
that
are
beauty
both
good
and
evil
lamp
to
heaven
or
the
marshes
of
despair
beauty
divine
but
not
divinity
not
parent
child
of
purity
and
truth
nor
fount
nor

but
bubble
lost
in
air
nor
tree
nor
fruit
only
a
fragrant
flower
flung
from
ambrosial
gardens
here
to
grow
that
life
might
be
the
less
a
wilderness
but
lo
a
loveliness
that
blooms
for
aye
that
withering
here
is
there
revivified
a
loveliness
made
lovelier
evermore
the
beauty
of
the
restful
and
the
risen
of
paradise
and
glory
higher
home
pure
as
the
mountain
monarch

pure
as
the
mantle
pure
as
the
cascade
limpid
crystalline
leaping
from
cliff
to
chasm
the
flood
blown
into
spirit
spray
of
dazzling
sheen
so
pure
the
love
that
warmed
my
boyish
breast
and
lit
the
yearning
of
my
youthful
eye
but
pure
love
the
purest
may
be
blind

then

blindness

not
what

what

a

he
who

spake
the
spirit
of
the
infinite
the
messenger
and
mind
of
holy
twain
some
men
i
found
embodiments
of
all
the
goodness
all
the
greatness
i
had
dreamed
men
seeming
gods
bestowing
benefits
as
suns
their
beams
as
seas
and
skies
their
showers
others
as
dwarfs
as
despots
by
compare
devoured
with
greed
consumed
with
jealousy
but
truth
taught
charity
gave
me
to
see
as
face
to
face
one
sees
familiar
friend
why
men
are
not
alike
in
magnitude
some
souls
than
others
have
more
summits
climbed
more
light
absorbed
more
moral
might
evolved
dowered
are
they
with
wealth
from
earlier
spheres
hence
wiser
worthier
than
those
they
lead
through
precept
vale
up
steep
example
height
to
where
love
beauty
wealth
power
glory
reign
while
some
innately
noble
are
borne
down
by
weight
of
weaknesses
inherited
by
passions
fierce
propensities
depraved
malific
legacy
of
centuries
that
much
of
their
true
worthiness
obscures
while
spirit
strives
with
flesh
for
mastery
for
higher
culture
and
for
added
might
and
yet
anon
such
souls
effulgent
shine
as
bursts
the
april
beam
through
banks
of
cloud
in
glory
from
which
envy
shades
its
eyes
while
stands
detraction
staring
stricken
dumb
the
glory
of
a
great
intelligence
which
mortal
mists
can
dim
but
for
a
time
spirits
like
stars
still
differ
in
degree
and
can
not
show
an
even
excellence
unequal
in
their
first
nobility
great
tells
of
greater
littleness
of
less
time
hills
and
vales
but
type
eternity
truth
taught
me
more
but
bade
me
silent
be
and
i
had
teachers
else
toil
prayer
and
pain
with
days
and
nights
of
misery
martyrdom
alone
and
lorn
in
grief

till
storm

and

underneath
shook
down

in

the
soul
of

alone
my
soul
upon
a
mighty
hill
ancient
with
lingering
snows
of
vanished
years
where
towering
forms
the
templed
azure
fill
wooed
by
the
breath
of
woodland
atmospheres
where
nature
throned
in
solitude
reveres
the
god
whose
glory
she
doth
symbolize
and
on
these
altars
watered
by
her
tears
spreads
far
around
the
fragrant
sacrifice
whose
incense
wafts
her
sweet
memorial
to
the
skies
here
will
i
rest
where
i
have
loved
to
roam
from
childhood
day
and
found
my
pensive
soul
congenial
home
far
from
the
depths
where
human
passions
play
born
at
their
feet
my
own
have
learned
to
stray
familiar
these
pathless
heights
and
feel
as
now
the
mind
assume
a
loftier
sway
soaring
for
themes
that
its
summits
steal
beyond
all
thought
to
reach
all
utterance
to
reveal
here
let
me
linger
o
my
native
hills
solemn
and
watchful
the
silent
waste
how
great
the
joy
his
bounding
bosom
thrills
whose
steps
aspiring
mar
your
summits
chaste
language
thy
richest
robe
thy
rarest
taste
how

in
befitting
dress
when

the
term

from

to

the
method

scheme
by
which
god
has
at

times
developed

it
also
denotes
a
period
marked
by

particular
development
of
the

work
such
as
the
mosaic
dispensation
lasting
from
moses
to
christ
or
the

dispensation
ending
in
the

that
made
necessary
another
restoration
of
the
gospel

the

while
revelation
is
silent
upon
the
subject
it
is

that
there
