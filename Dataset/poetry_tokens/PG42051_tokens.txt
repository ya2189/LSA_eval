years
ago
i
wrote
this
story
down
yet
the
light
of
eastern
in
my
eyes
still
my
heart
aglow
with
seas
that
old
down
dark
alleys
of
enchanted
night
stole
until
we
where
the
great
dome
glimmered
every
minaret
shaft
of
pearly
flame
the
cloudy
moon
years
ago
soon
too
soon
tale
too
will
be
told
yet
and
yet
this
old
eastern
tale
we
know
story
never
can
grow
old
love
himself
akra
the
slave
he
thought
to
see
me
tremble
and
totter
as
an
reed
when
he
spake
death
to
me
my
courage
toppled
in
the
dust
even
as
the
head
of
cactus
the
slashes
that
his
beasts
may
browse
unscathed
the
succulent
wounded
green
he
thought
to
have
me
broken
and
grovelling
at
his
feet
mouthing
and
mumbling
to
his
in
stammering
dread
of
death
aye
even
as
a
king
who
having
from
hand
received
his
crown
and
kingdom
for
ever
treads
in
terror
of
the
hour
when
death
shall
jog
his
elbow
twitch
the
purple
from
his
shoulders
and
claim
again
the
borrowed
crown
but
little
need
have
i
to
fear
the
crouching
lean
unto
whose
maw
day
after
day
i
flung
the
spoils
of
bow
and
arrow
ere
i
was
taken
captive
i
who
have
often
at
my
breast
awakened
in
the
to
see
death
leering
on
me
from
the
a
gaunt
and
slinking
shape
that
snuffed
the
dying
embers
blotting
out
the
friendly
stars
i
who
a
boy
have
toddled
gay
and
fearless
down
the
narrow
through
bodeful
and
have
felt
cold
snakes
uncoiling
and
gliding
my
naked
sole
from
clammy
slumber
startled
while
with
sharp
snap
and
crackle
branches
strained
behind
me
my
hand
scarce
snatching
me
before
the
spring
of
crouching
death
but
naught
of
this
the
king
could
know
he
only
knew
that
on
that
morning
when
first
i
came
before
him
captive
among
my
captive
brothers
and
as
he
lightly
held
in
idle
fingers
above
my
unbowed
head
in
equal
poise
freedom
or
the
servitude
of
life
i
clutched
at
life
and
cared
but
little
that
his
lips
should
curl
to
see
me
broken
a
slave
among
his
slaves
yet
never
slave
of
his
was
i
nor
did
i
take
my
new
life
from
his
nod
i
i
who
could
have
torn
the
proud
life
out
of
him
before
his
guards
could
stay
me
had
she
not
sat
beside
him
on
her
throne
and
he
who
knew
not
then
nor
ever
till
has
known
me
aught
but
slave
remembering
that
time
spake
doom
of
death
to
me
idly
as
to
a
slave
and
i
await
the
end
of
night
and
dawn
of
death
even
as
a
slave
awaits
nay
as
the
unvanquished
veteran
awaits
the
hour
of
victory
in
silence
wheels
the
night
over
dreaming
babylon
and
none
in
all
the
sleeping
city
stirs
save
the
cloaked
sentries
on
the
outer
walls
who
tread
out
patience
the
gates
of
brass
numb
with
slumber
or
maybe
some
unsleeping
priest
of
bel
a
lonely
warder
of
eternity
who
watches
on
the
seventh
stage
with
the
unslumbering
gods
yet
may
not
she
the
queen
whose
beauty
slaying
my
body
brings
my
soul
to
immortal
birth
although
she
does
not
know
of
my
last
vigil
on
the
peak
of
life
yet
may
not
she
awaken
troubled
by
strange
bewildering
dreams
with
heart
a
little
fearful
of
the
dawn
of
day
yet
unrevealed
there
is
no
sound
at
all
save
only
the
cool
plashing
of
fountains
in
the
courtyard
without
my
lonely
cell
for
fate
has
granted
to
me
this
last
least
consolation
of
sweet
sound
though
in
the
plains
i
perish
i
shall
hear
the
noise
of
waters
the
noise
of
running
waters
as
i
die
my
earliest
lullaby
shall
sing
my
heart
again
to
slumber
and
even
now
i
hear
calling
me
back
to
the
hills
of
home
and
dreaming
i
remember
the
little
yellow
brooks
that
ever
day
and
night
gush
down
the
mountains
singing
singing
by
the
caves
and
hearkening
unto
them
once
more
a
tiny
baby
a
wee
brown
fist
i
dabble
in
the
foaming
cool
frothing
round
my
wrist
spurting
up
my
arm
spraying
my
warm
face
and
then
again
i
chuckle
as
i
see
an
empty
gourd
fallen
in
the
swirling
waters
bobbing
on
the
tawny
eddies
swiftly
out
of
sight
and
yet
most
clearly
to
remembrance
comes
that
night
in
early
spring
when
loud
with
melted
snow
from
northern
peaks
the
torrent
roared
and
fretted
while
couched
within
the
cavern
the
clamour
kept
me
wakeful
and
even
when
i
slept
tumbled
tumultuous
through
my
dreams
and
seemed
to
surge
about
me
as
the
brawl
of
armèd
men
and
once
i
sprang
from
slumber
hot
and
startled
dreaming
that
i
felt
a
warm
breath
on
my
cheek
as
if
a
jackal
nuzzled
me
or
some
dread
slinking
foe
made
certain
of
my
sleeping
before
he
plunged
the
steel
but
nothing
stirred
within
the
glimmering
cavern
where
all
around
me
lay
my
sleeping
kindred
and
when
i
stole
without
with
noiseless
footsteps
to
rouse
the
smouldering
watchfire
into
flame
and
cast
fresh
crackling
brushwood
on
the
blaze
i
caught
no
glint
of
arms
betwixt
the
branches
nor
any
sound
or
rumour
save
the
choral
noise
of
cold
cold
singing
singing
to
the
stars
and
so
i
turned
me
from
the
brooding
night
and
couched
again
upon
the
i
slept
till
dawn
in
sleep
i
woke
to
see
the
cold
sky
kindling
red
beyond
the
mounded
ash
of
the
spent
fire
and
lay
a
moment
watching
the
pearly
light
caught
trembling
in
webs
about
the
woven
then
i
arose
and
left
my
kindred
slumbering
my
mother
by
my
father
and
at
her
breast
her
youngest
babe
with
dimpled
fingers
clutching
at
her
bosom
and
all
around
them
lying
their
sons
and
daughters
beautiful
in
sleep
with
parted
lips
and
easy
limbs
outstretched
along
the
tumbled
bedskins
and
while
they
slumbered
yet
in
shades
of
night
i
sprang
out
naked
into
eager
dawn
the
sun
had
not
yet
scaled
the
eastern
ridge
and
still
the
vales
were
hidden
from
my
eyes
by
snowy
wreaths
of
swathing
mist
but
high
upon
a
scar
that
jutted
sheer
and
stark
in
cold
grey
light
there
stood
an
antelope
with
lifted
muzzle
snuffing
the
fresh
day
when
scenting
me
afar
he
plunged
into
the
mist
with
one
quick
startled
bound
and
from
the
smoking
vapour
arose
a
gentle
pattering
as
down
the
rocky
trail
the
unseen
herd
went
trotting
upon
their
heels
and
from
the
clear
horizon
the
exultant
sun
sprang
and
on
a
little
mound
i
stood
with
eager
arms
outstretched
that
over
my
cold
body
the
first
warm
golden
beams
of
his
light
might
fall
and
thus
awhile
i
stood
in
radiant
adoration
tranced
until
i
caught
the
call
of
waters
and
running
downwards
to
the
stream
that
plunged
into
a
darkling
pool
where
in
the
rock
was
scooped
a
wide
deep
basin
upon
the
glassy
brink
a
moment
i
hung
shivering
and
gazing
down
through
deeps
of
lucent
shadow
and
then
i
leapt
headlong
and
felt
the
cloven
waters
closing
above
me
and
again
with
sobbing
breath
battled
to
the
light
and
air
and
i
ran
into
the
sunshine
shaking
from
my
tingling
limbs
showers
of
scintillating
drops
over
radiant
dewy
beds
of
the
snowy
cyclamen
and
anemone
till
my
tawny
body
glowed
with
warm
ruddy
pulsing
life
and
then
again
i
sought
the
stream
and
plunged
and
now
more
boldly
i
crossed
the
pool
with
easy
stroke
and
climbed
the
further
crag
and
turning
plunged
again
and
so
i
dived
and
swam
till
pangs
of
hunger
pricked
my
idle
fancy
homeward
and
eagerly
i
climbed
the
hill
when
not
a
throw
from
the
cavern
stooping
to
pluck
a
red
anemone
to
prank
the
wet
black
tangle
of
my
hair
i
heard
a
shout
and
looking
up
i
saw
strange
men
with
lifted
spears
bear
down
on
me
and
as
i
turned
a
javelin
sang
above
my
shrinking
shoulder
and
bit
the
ground
before
me
but
swift
as
light
i
sped
until
i
reached
the
pool
and
leapt
therein
and
he
who
pressed
most
hotly
on
my
heels
fell
stumbling
after
still
i
never
slackened
although
i
heard
a
floundering
splash
and
then
the
laughter
of
his
comrades
and
as
i
swam
for
life
betwixt
my
thrusting
heels
another
spear
that
clove
the
crystal
waters
glanced
underneath
my
body
and
in
the
quivered
bolt
upright
caught
in
a
cleft
of
rock
with
frantic
arm
i
struck
straight
as
a
snake
across
the
pool
and
climbed
the
further
bank
and
plunging
through
deep
brake
ran
wildly
onward
startling
as
i
went
a
browsing
herd
of
antelope
that
bounding
fled
before
me
down
the
valley
and
after
them
i
raced
as
though
the
hunter
not
the
hunted
until
the
chase
sang
in
my
blood
and
braced
my
straining
thews
i
knew
not
if
men
followed
yet
on
i
sped
impetuously
as
speeds
the
onaga
that
breasts
the
windy
morning
with
lifted
head
and
nostrils
wide
exultant
in
his
youth
so
on
and
ever
on
scarce
knowing
why
i
ran
enough
for
me
to
feel
earth
beaten
back
behind
my
heels
and
hear
the
loud
air
singing
the
in
my
ears
till
stumbling
headlong
over
an
unseen
fallen
branch
i
rolled
in
a
deep
bed
of
withered
leaves
and
lay
in
shuddering
ecstasy
of
hot
tumultuous
blood
that
rioted
through
every
throbbing
vein
but
when
again
i
breathed
more
easily
and
my
wild
fluttering
heart
kept
slower
beat
my
thoughts
ran
wondering
backward
and
i
arose
and
followed
them
with
swift
and
stealthy
pace
until
i
reached
the
stream
along
the
bank
i
stole
with
wary
step
until
i
came
to
where
the
waters
narrowed
raging
through
a
gorge
nigh
the
threshold
of
my
home
and
across
the
thunderous
flood
from
crag
to
crag
i
leapt
and
then
i
climbed
a
cedar
from
whose
close
ambush
i
could
watch
who
came
or
went
about
the
i
lay
along
a
level
branch
and
through
the
thick
dark
screen
i
peered
with
eager
eyes
but
no
one
crossed
my
sight
the
whole
land
lay
before
me
drowsing
in
deepest
noonday
slumber
no
twig
stirred
in
the
breathless
blaze
and
underneath
the
boughs
no
serpent
rustled
and
in
the
earth
and
air
naught
waked
save
one
lone
eagle
nigh
the
sun
with
wings
unbaffled
beating
up
the
blue
unclouded
heavens
a
dreamless
suave
security
seemed
brooding
the
golden
slumber
whence
rang
or
flashed
no
hint
of
lurking
peril
i
dropped
to
earth
and
crouching
low
i
stole
yet
nearer
through
the
brake
till
drawing
nigh
the
i
heard
the
sound
of
sobbing
and
then
i
saw
within
the
gloom
my
mother
and
my
sisters
clustering
round
my
body
lying
stark
and
dead
a
in
his
breast
and
as
i
crept
to
them
they
did
not
hear
me
nor
ever
lift
their
heads
but
shuddering
crouched
together
with
drooping
breasts
in
falling
hair
by
that
familiar
form
in
such
strange
slumber
bound
only
the
baby
on
her
shoulder
slung
saw
me
and
crowed
me
greeting
as
i
stooped
down
to
touch
my
weeping
mother
who
turning
suddenly
with
wild
eyes
arose
with
whispered
warning
but
even
then
too
late
already
from
behind
around
my
throat
an
arm
was
flung
and
heavily
i
fell
yet
with
a
desperate
wrench
i
slipped
the
clutch
of
my
assailant
and
picking
up
a
slingstone
that
lay
handy
i
crashed
it
through
his
helm
and
dead
he
dropped
and
now
upon
me
all
his
fellows
thronged
like
hounds
about
an
antelope
and
gripped
my
naked
limbs
and
dragged
me
down
a
struggling
beast
among
them
and
desperately
i
fought
as
fights
the
boar
at
bay
when
all
the
yelling
pack
with
lathered
lips
and
white
teeth
gnashing
is
closing
in
upon
him
and
in
his
quivering
flank
and
gasping
throat
he
feels
the
fangs
of
death
till
overcome
at
last
they
bound
me
hand
and
foot
with
knotted
leathern
thongs
and
dragged
me
out
to
where
beneath
the
trees
trussed
in
like
manner
with
defiant
eyes
my
brothers
lay
already
side
by
side
they
laid
me
in
the
shade
and
flicked
my
wincing
spirit
with
laughter
and
light
words
now
is
the
taken
then
another
on
whose
dark
sullen
face
there
burned
a
livid
weal
a
buck
in
a
panther
brought
to
bay
and
then
his
fellow
true
enough
and
yet
for
such
young
thews
they
give
good
gold
they
give
good
gold
in
babylon
and
laughing
thus
they
left
us
to
lie
through
hours
of
aching
silence
until
at
length
the
cool
of
evening
fell
when
they
returned
from
slumber
and
loosed
the
that
we
might
stand
and
bade
our
mother
feed
us
and
she
with
tender
fingers
held
the
to
our
parching
lips
and
thrust
dried
dates
betwixt
our
teeth
and
wept
to
see
us
standing
there
with
helpless
hands
before
her
then
bringing
out
their
mules
they
saddled
them
and
tied
us
to
the
girths
on
either
hand
they
drove
my
weeping
sisters
from
the
cavern
and
sought
to
tear
my
mother
from
her
home
but
she
escaped
them
and
they
let
her
bide
amid
the
ruins
of
her
life
whose
light
had
dropped
so
suddenly
from
out
the
highest
heavens
and
when
i
turned
to
look
on
her
and
win
from
her
a
last
farewell
i
saw
her
sitting
desolate
betwixt
her
silent
husband
and
her
wailing
babe
with
still
strange
eyes
that
stared
upon
the
dead
unseeing
while
her
own
children
went
from
her
scarce
knowing
that
they
left
her
nevermore
to
look
upon
her
face
thus
we
set
out
as
over
the
darkening
southern
crags
the
new
keen
curved
blade
was
thrust
my
sisters
trooping
on
before
us
like
a
drove
of
young
gazelles
which
in
the
dead
of
night
with
pards
in
leash
and
torches
flaring
the
hunters
have
encompassed
they
moved
with
timid
steps
and
little
runs
stumbling
with
stifled
cries
and
starting
from
every
lurking
shadow
behind
them
lifted
lash
before
them
ever
crouching
the
horror
of
the
unknown
night
while
as
they
moved
before
us
the
moonlight
shivered
off
their
shrinking
shoulders
and
naked
glancing
limbs
in
shimmering
strange
beauty
and
closely
on
their
heels
i
with
my
brothers
foremost
in
the
file
marched
tethered
the
plodding
beasts
whose
stolid
riders
sat
each
with
his
javelin
on
the
pummel
couched
in
watchful
silence
with
dark
eyes
alert
and
once
nigh
driven
crazy
by
the
tugging
of
the
thongs
i
sprang
into
the
air
as
down
a
rocky
steep
we
scrambled
and
strove
to
burst
the
galling
bonds
or
hurl
my
guards
on
one
another
but
all
too
sure
of
foot
the
beasts
and
too
securely
girths
and
cords
held
me
and
i
stumbled
instantly
a
thong
struck
my
wincing
shoulders
blow
on
thudding
blow
i
bit
my
lips
and
strode
on
silently
nor
fought
again
for
freedom
so
on
we
journeyed
through
the
night
and
down
familiar
through
deep
dark
forest
ever
down
and
down
fording
the
streams
whose
waters
flowed
in
eddies
of
delicious
aching
cool
about
our
weary
thighs
and
once
when
in
that
swirled
about
the
plunging
beasts
a
startled
otter
glancing
before
their
very
hoofs
affrighted
them
and
rearing
with
blind
and
desperate
floundering
they
nearly
dragged
us
down
to
death
and
ere
we
righted
with
a
fearful
cry
my
eldest
sister
from
the
bevy
broke
and
struck
with
wild
arm
lashing
desperately
until
the
current
caught
her
and
she
sank
to
rise
no
more
and
on
again
we
travelled
down
through
the
darkling
woodlands
and
once
i
saw
green
burning
eyes
where
on
a
bough
a
panther
crouched
as
though
to
pounce
upon
my
sisters
but
the
sudden
crack
of
whips
startling
him
he
snarled
and
turned
with
lashing
tail
crashing
through
dense
brushwood
when
once
again
we
came
unto
a
clearing
the
night
was
near
its
noon
and
all
the
vales
that
lay
before
us
were
filled
with
moving
moonlit
mists
that
seemed
phantasmal
waters
of
that
enchanted
world
where
we
in
dreams
sail
over
still
lagoons
throughout
eternal
night
and
under
unknown
stars
still
on
we
fared
unresting
until
the
low
moon
paled
when
halting
on
a
we
first
looked
down
on
babylon
far
in
the
dreaming
west
a
cluster
of
dim
towers
scarce
visible
to
wearied
eyes
we
camped
within
a
sheltering
and
all
the
day
beneath
the
level
boughs
upon
the
needles
lay
with
fleeting
fretful
dreams
that
could
not
quite
forget
the
chafing
cords
that
held
our
arms
in
aching
numbness
but
ere
the
noon
in
sounder
sleep
i
sank
dreaming
i
floated
on
a
still
deep
pool
beneath
dark
overhanging
branches
and
seemed
to
feel
upon
my
cheek
the
cool
caress
of
waters
while
far
above
me
through
the
night
of
trees
noon
glimmered
faintly
as
the
glint
of
stars
as
thus
i
lay
in
indolent
ecstasy
me
suddenly
the
waters
curved
and
i
was
dragged
down
and
down
through
gurgling
deeps
of
swirling
drowning
darkness
when
i
awoke
in
terror
and
strove
to
sit
upright
but
tautly
with
a
jerk
the
thongs
that
held
me
to
my
brothers
dragged
me
back
to
earth
awhile
i
lay
with
staring
eyes
awake
watching
a
big
grey
spider
crouched
overhead
in
ambush
a
twig
beside
her
web
oft
sallying
out
to
bind
yet
more
securely
the
flies
and
then
once
more
i
slumbered
and
dreamed
a
face
leant
over
me
more
fair
than
any
face
my
waking
eyes
had
ever
looked
upon
its
beauty
burned
above
me
not
dusky
like
my
faces
but
pale
as
the
wan
moon
reflected
in
a
flood
of
darkly
flowing
waters
or
as
the
creaming
froth
that
born
amid
the
thunder
of
the
fall
floats
on
the
bosom
in
the
sunshine
bubble
after
bubble
perishing
in
air
so
a
moment
over
me
with
frail
and
fleeting
glimmer
of
strange
elusive
evanescent
light
the
holy
vision
hovered
and
yet
whenever
with
a
fervent
longing
i
sought
to
look
into
the
darkling
eyes
the
face
would
fade
from
me
as
foam
caught
in
an
eddy
until
at
last
i
wakened
and
wondering
saw
a
pale
star
gleaming
betwixt
the
and
soon
our
captors
stirred
and
we
arose
to
see
the
walls
and
towers
of
babylon
dark
against
the
clear
rose
of
the
afterglow
already
in
the
surge
of
shadows
caught
as
night
beneath
us
slowly
westward
swept
flooding
the
dreaming
plain
that
lay
before
us
vast
limitless
bewildering
and
strange
to
as
down
the
slope
we
went
and
when
at
last
we
left
behind
the
hills
and
singing
waters
a
vague
oppressive
fear
of
those
dim
silent
leagues
of
level
land
fell
on
me
and
i
almost
seemed
to
bear
upon
my
shoulders
the
vaster
dome
of
overwhelming
night
and
trembling
like
a
child
i
looked
askance
at
my
two
captors
as
they
rode
on
in
heedless
silence
their
swarthy
faces
sharp
against
the
lucent
sky
and
then
once
more
the
old
familiar
watchfires
of
the
stars
brought
courage
to
my
bosom
and
the
young
brilliant
horn
was
exalted
in
the
sky
and
soon
the
glooming
wilderness
awoke
with
glittering
waters
as
a
friendly
wind
sang
unto
me
among
the
swaying
reeds
while
cloud
on
cloud
the
snowy
flocks
of
pelican
before
our
coming
rose
and
as
they
swerved
to
southward
the
moonlight
shivered
off
their
flashing
pinions
so
on
we
marched
till
dawn
across
the
plain
and
on
and
on
beneath
the
waxing
moon
each
night
we
travelled
westward
until
at
last
we
halted
by
the
broad
flood
of
mighty
roaring
tigris
and
aroused
from
midnight
slumber
the
surly
grumbling
ferrymen
and
crossed
the
swollen
waters
upon
the
great
skin
rafts
then
on
again
we
fared
until
the
far
dim
towers
soared
in
the
dawnlight
and
we
encamped
beside
a
stream
beneath
dry
rustling
palms
and
heavily
i
slumbered
and
only
wakened
once
at
noon
when
lifting
up
my
head
i
saw
the
towers
of
babylon
burning
blue
far
off
in
the
blind
heat
and
slept
again
till
sunset
when
we
took
our
westward
course
along
the
low
bank
of
a
broad
canal
that
glimmered
wanly
a
moonless
sky
higher
and
higher
still
as
we
drew
slowly
nearer
arose
the
vasty
walls
and
serried
towers
that
seemed
to
thrust
among
the
stars
and
on
embattled
summits
bear
the
night
unbowed
beneath
their
burden
as
easily
as
with
unruffled
brows
and
limber
upright
bodies
the
carry
at
eve
the
brimming
pitchers
poised
upon
their
heads
and
when
above
us
the
walls
shut
out
the
western
stars
beneath
their
shade
at
midnight
we
encamped
to
await
till
dawn
should
open
the
city
gates
for
us
that
night
we
did
not
sleep
but
crouched
upon
the
ground
we
watched
the
moon
rise
over
babylon
till
far
behind
us
the
glittering
waste
was
flung
the
huge
shadow
and
the
moving
shades
of
sentries
who
unseen
above
our
heads
paced
through
the
night
incessantly
thus
long
we
sat
hushed
with
awed
expectation
and
gazing
the
plain
that
we
had
travelled
as
gradually
the
climbing
moon
escaping
from
the
clustering
towers
revealed
waters
and
the
sharp
shrill
cry
of
owls
sweeping
by
on
noiseless
plumes
assailed
the
vasty
silence
shivering
off
like
darts
from
some
impenetrable
shield
and
as
we
waited
sometimes
fearfully
i
gazed
up
those
stupendous
soaring
walls
of
that
great
slumbering
city
wondering
what
doom
behind
the
bastioned
ramparts
slept
what
destiny
beneath
the
brooding
night
awaited
me
beyond
the
brazen
gates
but
naught
the
blind
indifferent
stars
revealed
though
towards
the
long
ending
with
gazing
up
that
aching
height
a
drowsiness
fell
over
me
and
in
a
restless
i
lay
dreaming
that
life
and
death
before
me
stood
and
as
each
thrust
towards
me
a
shrouded
cup
implacable
silence
bade
me
choose
and
drink
but
as
i
stretched
a
blind
uncertain
hand
to
take
the
cup
of
death
i
wakened
and
dawn
trembled
at
last
beyond
the
eastern
hills
and
star
by
star
night
failed
and
eagerly
the
sun
leapt
up
the
sky
and
as
his
flashing
rays
smote
kindling
towers
and
flaming
gates
of
brass
across
the
reedy
moat
a
clattering
drawbridge
fell
and
wide
the
glittering
portals
slowly
swung
and
there
came
streaming
out
in
slow
procession
a
sleepy
caravan
of
slouching
camels
groaning
and
grumbling
as
they
strode
along
beneath
their
mountainous
burdens
upon
whose
swaying
summits
impassively
the
merchants
sat
they
passed
us
slowly
by
and
then
we
took
the
bridge
and
while
our
captors
parleyed
with
the
guards
who
stood
on
either
hand
with
naked
swords
i
turned
my
head
and
saw
for
the
last
time
far
eastward
the
cold
peaks
beyond
my
dim
blue
native
hills
and
as
i
looked
my
thoughts
flew
homeward
and
i
one
dreaming
moment
stood
by
my
mourning
mother
in
the
cavern
of
desolation
looking
on
the
dead
and
then
between
the
brazen
and
underneath
the
brazen
lintel
at
last
we
entered
babylon
before
us
yet
another
wall
arose
and
turning
sharply
down
a
narrow
way
the
living
breath
of
heaven
seemed
shut
from
us
as
though
beneath
the
beetling
crags
of
some
deep
by
cliffs
of
wall
on
either
hand
that
soared
up
to
the
narrow
sky
which
with
dim
lustre
lit
the
shimmering
surface
of
enamelled
brick
whereon
through
giant
groves
hunters
chased
the
boar
or
falcon
after
flying
crane
but
soon
we
reached
another
gate
and
we
entered
and
plunged
into
the
traffic
of
clamorous
merchantmen
speeding
their
business
ere
the
heat
of
day
and
as
we
jostled
slowly
through
bewildering
bazaars
the
porters
and
the
idler
wayfarers
all
turned
to
look
upon
our
shame
with
cold
unpitying
eyes
and
indolent
gaping
mouths
or
jested
with
our
captors
until
we
left
the
busier
thoroughfares
and
walked
through
groves
of
cypress
and
of
ilex
where
not
a
sound
or
rumour
troubled
the
silence
of
the
boughs
and
glimmering
deeps
of
peace
save
only
the
cool
spurt
of
waters
that
from
a
myriad
unseen
jets
fretted
the
crystal
airs
of
morning
and
fell
in
frolic
showers
of
twinkling
rainbow
drops
that
plashed
in
unseen
basins
and
through
the
blaze
of
tremulous
with
blossom
that
flickered
in
a
rosy
silken
snow
of
falling
petals
over
us
and
wreathed
about
our
feet
in
soft
and
scented
drifts
beneath
pomegranate
trees
in
young
green
leaf
and
through
vast
gardens
glowing
with
strange
flowers
such
as
no
april
kindled
into
bloom
among
the
valleys
of
my
native
hills
we
came
unto
a
court
of
many
fountains
where
leaping
off
their
jaded
mules
our
captors
loosed
the
thongs
that
held
us
but
left
our
wrists
still
bound
and
one
with
great
clay
pitchers
came
and
over
our
hot
bodies
poured
out
cool
cleansing
waters
in
a
gurgling
crystal
stream
and
flung
coarse
robes
of
indigo
about
our
naked
shoulders
and
here
we
left
behind
us
the
maidens
and
the
younger
boys
and
passing
through
a
gateway
came
out
upon
a
busy
wharf
where
southward
midway
through
the
city
the
broad
euphrates
flows
his
dark
flood
thronged
with
and
of
reed
and
bitumen
piled
high
with
glistering
barbel
and
foreign
craft
with
sails
and
laden
deep
with
precious
merchandise
that
over
wide
bewildering
waters
across
the
perilous
world
the
adventurous
mariners
who
swear
by
unknown
gods
in
alien
tongues
bring
ever
to
the
gates
of
babylon
we
crossed
the
drawbridge
round
whose
granite
piers
swirled
strong
waters
loud
and
tawny
and
through
great
brazen
portals
passed
within
the
palace
gates
when
first
i
saw
afar
the
arch
on
arch
and
tier
on
tier
against
a
glowing
sky
two
strapping
nubians
like
young
giants
hewn
from
marble
by
some
immortal
hand
in
immemorial
ages
led
us
slowly
onward
the
dappled
slung
across
their
shoulders
scarcely
hid
the
thews
beneath
the
dark
skin
rippling
as
they
strode
along
before
us
through
courts
of
alabaster
and
painted
corridors
and
chambers
fair
with
flowery
tapestries
they
led
us
wondering
till
at
last
we
came
into
a
vast
dim
hall
of
glimmering
gold
the
end
of
all
our
journeying
and
as
we
halted
on
the
threshold
my
eyes
could
see
but
little
for
a
moment
in
the
dusky
heavy
air
through
the
ceaseless
cloud
of
incense
rising
from
the
smouldering
braziers
to
the
gold
dome
tingling
strangely
in
my
nostrils
as
i
came
from
morning
airs
then
slowly
filling
them
with
drowsy
fume
when
looking
up
with
eyes
i
saw
the
king
upon
his
golden
throne
and
through
my
body
raged
rebellious
blood
in
baffled
riot
beating
at
my
corded
wrists
as
if
to
burst
the
galling
bonds
that
i
might
hurl
that
lean
swart
face
so
idly
turning
towards
us
with
thin
curled
lips
and
cold
incurious
eyes
to
headlong
death
yea
even
though
i
tumbled
the
towers
of
babylon
round
about
my
head
and
when
our
captors
bowed
their
foreheads
low
obsequious
to
the
throne
i
stood
upright
and
gazed
my
loathing
on
that
listless
form
the
gay
embroidered
robe
the
golden
cap
that
prankt
the
crispèd
locks
the
short
square
beard
and
barbered
but
in
a
flash
a
heavy
blow
fell
on
my
head
and
struck
me
to
my
knees
before
the
sleek
indifferent
king
and
then
on
either
hand
with
gripping
palms
upon
my
shoulders
set
the
nubians
towered
above
me
like
mighty
men
of
stone
and
savagely
i
struggled
to
rise
again
when
as
i
vainly
battled
in
their
unrelenting
clutch
my
eyes
lit
for
the
first
time
on
the
queen
who
sat
upon
the
daïs
by
her
lord
on
a
throne
of
ivory
and
all
the
hate
died
in
me
as
i
saw
the
face
that
hovered
over
me
in
dream
when
i
had
slept
beneath
the
cedar
the
brows
which
the
clustered
hair
hung
like
the
smoke
of
torches
against
a
canopy
of
peacock
plumes
the
deep
brown
burning
eyes
from
which
the
soul
looked
on
me
in
fierce
pity
and
as
i
gazed
on
that
exultant
beauty
the
hunter
and
the
slayer
of
men
was
slain
within
me
instantly
and
i
forgot
the
mountains
and
my
home
my
desolate
mother
and
my
death
my
captive
sisters
and
the
thronèd
king
i
was
as
one
that
moment
into
the
world
and
thewed
yet
with
the
wondering
heart
of
childhood
and
unto
me
it
seemed
that
as
the
queen
looked
down
on
me
there
stole
into
her
eyes
some
dim
remembrance
of
old
dreams
that
in
their
brown
depths
flickered
with
strange
elusive
light
like
stars
that
tremble
in
still
one
spake
i
scarce
knew
whom
nor
cared
and
bade
me
choose
before
the
throne
between
a
life
of
slavery
or
merciful
swift
death
death
that
but
a
moment
since
i
would
have
dragged
exulting
on
me
and
with
my
eyes
still
set
on
the
face
i
answered
i
will
serve
and
scarcely
heeded
that
my
wrists
were
loosed
and
huddled
in
a
stifling
hut
that
night
among
my
fellows
i
could
not
sleep
at
all
but
gazed
till
dawn
upon
that
face
which
hovered
me
like
the
moon
of
dreams
and
seemed
to
draw
the
wandering
tides
of
life
in
one
vast
wave
which
ever
strove
to
climb
the
heavens
wherein
she
moved
that
it
might
break
in
triumphing
foam
about
her
not
then
nor
ever
afterwards
was
i
a
slave
among
my
but
one
who
with
mean
drudgery
and
daily
penance
serves
before
a
holy
altar
that
sometimes
as
he
labours
his
glad
eyes
may
catch
a
gleam
of
the
immortal
light
within
the
secret
shrine
yea
and
maybe
shall
look
one
day
with
trembling
on
the
imperishable
god
and
even
when
day
after
day
i
bore
the
big
laden
with
wet
clay
digged
beyond
the
western
moat
although
i
seemed
to
tread
as
treads
the
ox
that
turns
the
a
blindfold
round
of
servitude
my
quenchless
vision
ever
burned
before
me
and
when
in
after
days
i
fed
the
roaring
and
toiled
by
them
through
sweltering
days
though
over
me
at
times
would
come
great
longing
for
the
and
the
noise
of
or
when
more
skilled
i
moulded
the
damp
clay
into
bricks
and
spread
the
colour
and
the
glaze
and
in
heat
of
glowing
kilns
i
baked
them
durable
and
meet
for
service
my
vision
flamed
yet
brighter
and
unto
me
it
seemed
as
if
my
gross
and
useless
clay
were
burned
in
a
white
ecstasy
of
lustral
fire
that
in
the
fashioning
of
the
house
of
love
i
might
serve
perfectly
the
need
thus
many
months
i
laboured
till
one
day
at
the
noontide
hour
of
rest
i
lay
and
with
a
sharpened
reed
as
write
down
the
holy
lore
on
tablets
of
wet
clay
on
the
moist
earth
beside
me
i
limned
a
young
fawn
cropping
a
bunch
of
tender
overhanging
leaves
and
as
i
slowly
drew
i
dreamt
a
little
sadly
of
the
days
when
i
too
roamed
untethered
and
drinking
in
unquestioning
the
sunshine
and
the
air
and
all
the
rapture
of
the
earth
that
turns
new
every
morning
to
the
wondering
sun
refashioned
in
still
nights
of
starry
dews
but
one
the
while
unseen
of
me
watched
my
unconscious
hand
approving
and
i
was
set
next
morning
among
the
craftsmen
who
so
deftly
limned
the
hunts
and
battles
for
the
palace
walls
and
happily
with
them
i
lived
a
life
of
loving
labour
for
each
line
flowed
from
the
knowledge
of
my
heart
i
drew
the
startled
ostrich
fleeing
from
the
noose
the
brindled
lynx
the
onaga
in
flight
the
bristling
boar
at
bay
crouched
in
a
deadly
ring
of
threatening
spears
with
streaming
nostrils
and
red
eyes
ablaze
the
striped
hyæna
the
gaunt
wolf
the
skulking
jackal
the
grey
fox
the
hunting
leopard
and
the
antelope
in
tense
with
every
thew
astrain
the
dappled
panther
the
gazelle
butting
with
black
horns
through
the
tangled
brake
the

the

crouched
with

afire
the

perched
on

crag
against
the
afterglow
of
lucent
ruby

with

in
over
a

yawning

or
the

his

fording
a

and
sometimes
as
we
toiled
a
terrible
fleeting
rapture
would
come
upon
me
when
the
queen
passed
by
us
with
her
maidens
or
paused
a
moment
gazing
with
tranced
and
kindling
eyes
upon
our
labours
but
never
did
i
dare
at
any
time
to
lift
my
eyes
to
hers
and
look
as
soul
on
soul
as
on
the
day
her
beauty
brought
to
birth
the
strange
new
life
within
me
in
silence
she
would
ever
leave
us
and
ever
with
her
passing
perished
the
light
and
colour
of
my
work
so
that
my
heart
failed
daunted
by
that
glimpse
of
the
beauty
and
sometimes
i
would
carve
in
ruddy
teak
or
ivory
from
the
indian
merchants
bought
or
in
the
rare
black
basalt
little
beasts
to

in

the

with

or
little

doves
that
pecked
a
golden
bunch
of
dates
and
then
of
these
in
settings
of
fine
gold
made
fillets
rings
and
thus
one
day
dreaming
as
ever
of
the
queen
i
wrought
a
golden
serpent
for
her
hair
and
when
i
brought
it
to
the
king
next
morn
where
he
sat
brooding
over
chess
he
bade
me
bear
it
to
the
queen
myself
and
so
i
went
unto
her
where
she
sat
among
her
singing
maidens
at
the
loom
weaving
a
silken
web
of
tyrian
dye
i
laid
the
trinket
at
her
feet
in
silence
and
she
arose
and
set
it
in
her
hair
whose
living
lustre
far
outshone
the
cold
dead
metal
i
had
fashioned
as
she
stood
before
me
dreaming
in
her
robe
of
flowing
blue
then
looked
a
moment
on
me
with
kind
eyes
and
though
she
spoke
no
word
i
turned
and
fled
in
trembling
before
the
light
that
shivered
through
me
and
struck
my
soul
with
shuddering
ecstasy
and
still
through
many
days
although
i
did
not
look
again
upon
those
dreaming
eyes
their
visionary
light
within
my
soul
revealed
eternity
thus
have
the
mortal
years
flowed
onward
to
the
perfect
end
this
day
of
days
that
never
night
shall
quench
nor
darkness
vanquish
and
at
dawn
i
die
and
yet
this
morning
as
i
slowly
climbed
the
steep
ascending
stages
that
lead
up
to
the
where
tier
on
tier
the
great
brick
arches
bore
their
april
wealth
of
blossoms
plumed
with
palm
and
dusky
cypress
i
little
knew
that
i
who
came
to
carve
a
garland
round
a
porphry
basin
should
scale
so
soon
the
utmost
peak
of
life
throughout
the
morn
i
toiled
until
an
hour
ere
noon
for
no
one
save
the
king
and
queen
may
walk
in
those
high
gardens
after
midday
when
underneath
a
cypress
shade
i
paused
a
moment
resting
and
looking
down
upon
the
basking
city
beneath
me
slumbering
deeply
garden
on
garden
glowing
grove
on
grove
like
some
green
fabric
shot
with
myriad
hues
and
chequered
with
white
clusters
of
flat
roofs
aquiver
in
clear
heat
and
then
i
gazed
up
through
the
aching
azure
at
the
restless
kites
that
hover
ever
over
babylon
and
as
i
watched
one
bird
that
hung
above
the
pyramid
of
great
temple
with
wide
pinions
spread
as
though
it
kept
eternal
vigil
over
the
golden
image
in
the
golden
shrine
i
thought
of
eagles
poised
above
the
peaks
of
glittering
snows
beyond
the
eastern
plains
thus
i
lay
lulled
by
the
tinkling
waters
till
unawares
sleep
slowly
overcame
me
and
noonday
drifted
by
and
still
i
slept
unheeding
and
in
my
sleep
i
looked
on
beauty
in
a
quiet
place
of
forest
gloom
and
immemorial
dream
when
something
rousing
me
from
slumber
with
waking
eyes
that
yet
seemed
i
looked
upon
the
queen
where
in
a
secret
close
set
thickly
round
with
screens
of
yew
and
ilex
she
stood
upon
the
dark
broad
brim
of
a
wide
granite
basin
gazing
down
with
dreaming
eyes
into
the
glooming
cool
unraimented
save
of
the
flickering
gleam
reflected
from
the
lucent
waters
that
flowed
before
her
silently
and
slowly
from
her
feet
the
cold
light
rippled
up
her
body
till
entangled
in
the
meshes
of
her
hair
it
flooded
the
calm
rapture
of
her
face
when
dreaming
still
she
lifted
up
her
eyes
unseeing
and
i
looked
upon
her
soul
unveiled
in
naked
immortality
untrammelled
by
the
trappings
of
brief
time
and
cloaks
of
circumstance
how
long
i
looked
upon
the
perfect
beauty
i
can
not
tell
each
moment
flowing
to
eternity
bearing
me
further
from
narrow
shores
though
yet
a
little
while
from
those
unshadowed
deeps
time
sought
to
hold
me
suddenly
i
felt
a
ghostly
arrow
pierce
my
life
and
i
leapt
up
and
turning
i
saw
the
king
beside
me
with
steely
glittering
eyes
shooting
barbed
anger
though
he
coldly
spake
with
evil
curling
lips
slave
thou
art
dead
and
yet
i
did
not
quail
but
looking
his
brows
i
answered
and
he
blenched
before
my
words
nay
i
have
seen
and
am
newborn
a
king
and
then
his
craven
fingers
went
quaking
to
his
wagging
beard
as
if
he
felt
my
clutch
upon
his
throat
yet
though
with
one
quick
blow
i
might
have
hurled
him
down
to
death
i
never
stirred
and
eyeing
me
he
summoned
the
who
kept
watch
below
but
i
ere
they
could
spring
up
the
first
stage
went
forth
to
meet
them
and
they
bound
my
wrists
and
so
down
from
the
hills
my
life
has
flowed
until
at
fullest
flood
it
meets
the
sea
with
calm
and
unregretful
heart
i
wait
till
dawn
shall
loose
the
arrow
from
the
bow
i
who
with
eager
faltering
hand
have
sought
to
fashion
a
little
beauty
in
the
end
have
looked
on
the
perfect
beauty
and
i
die
even
as
the
priest
who
in
the
heart
of
night
trembling
before
the
shrine
looks
on
the
face
of
god
and
perishes
i
die
and
yet
maybe
when
earth
lies
heavily
upon
the
towers
and
tumbled
walls
and
broken
gates
of
brass
and
the
winds
whisper
one
another
where
oh
where
is
babylon
in
the
dim
underworld
of
dreaming
shades
my
soul
shall
seek
out
beauty
and
look
once
more
upon
the
unveiled
vision
and
not
die
night
passes
and
already
in
the
court
amid
the
plash
of
fountains
there
sounds
the
pad
of
naked
feet
approaching
with
slow
deliberate
pace
as
though
they
trod
out
all
my
perished
years
the
nubians
come
to
lead
me
out
to
death
slowly
the
great
door
opens
and
clearer
comes
the
call
of
waters
cool
airs
are
on
my
brow
lo
in
the
east
the
dawn
