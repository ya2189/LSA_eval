considering
the
age
of

we
feel
that
the

contains
real
merit
while
the
sentiment
expressed
betokens
that
patriotic
spirit
which
never
fails
or
hesitates

so
boys
let
save
our
tin
the
storm
the
rough
old
storm
is
whirling
swirling
past
he
makes
the
treetops
bow
their
heads
and
trembles
at
his
blast
he
never
stops
to
think
of
the
damage
he
may
do
he
always
rushing
in
and
out
and
hitting
batting
you
he
pushes
big
black
clouds
against
the
mountain
tops
the
rain
and
hail
comes
rushing
down
in
large
round
crystal
drops
the
storm
will
soon
be
over
see
the
rainbow
in
the
sky
the
birds
will
sing
on
airy
wing
and
the
bright
sun
shine
on
high
do
not
worry
do
not
worry
over
trifles
though
to
you
they
may
seem
great
all
your
fretting
will
not
help
you
or
your
troubles
dissipate
if
your
sky
is
dark
and
gloomy
and
the
sun
is
hid
from
view
bravely
smile
and
keep
on
smiling
and
your
friends
will
smile
with
you
happiness
is
so
contagious
and
a
smile
is
never
lost
then
why
worry
over
trifles
tho
your
heart
seems
tempest
tossed
therefore
go
on
life
journey
with
an
optimistic
smile
see
the
world
is
good
to
live
in
and
that
living
is
worth
while
how
can
we
fool
the
rooster
written
when
the
clock
was
set
ahead
one
hour
on
april
our
rooster
wakes
at
five
and
crows
with
all
his
might
he
tries
to
wake
the
people
up
before
the
day
is
light
when
daddy
hears
the
rooster
crow
he
knows
he
should
awake
and
light
the
kitchen
fire
so
ma
can
cook
the
johnny
cake
now
maybe
we
can
fool
my
dad
that
it
five
when
it
four
and
maybe
the
system
the
best
we
have
had
to
fool
some
thousands
of
people
or
more
but
how
can
we
fool
that
rooster
i
have
always
thought
our
rooster
had
a
clock
inside
of
his
head
and
i
do
know
how
we
can
fix
it
so
we
can
set
the
clock
ahead
i
asked
my
dad
and
he
said
to
me
why
son
you
surely
know
a
rooster
instinct
wakens
him
and
tells
him
when
to
crow
now
the
hands
of
the
clock
we
can
turn
ahead
we
can
fool
the
people
and
feel
content
but
the
thing
that
worries
me
night
and
day
and
on
which
my
entire
thought
is
bent
is
how
can
we
fool
that
rooster
a
wreath
of
flowers
written
for
decoration
day
may
i
wove
me
a
wreath
of
flowers
to
place
in
memories
hall
in
honor
of
the
brave
and
fearless
men
who
had
answered
our
country
call
the
men
who
had
answered
and
fought
and
died
for
the
cause
of
freedom
our
country
pride
i
wove
me
a
wreath
of
flowers
with
many
a
sigh
and
tear
as
a
tribute
to
all
the
good
and
true
who
were
given
few
honors
here
the
man
of
humble
piety
who
lived
and
died
in
obscurity
a
wreath
of
flowers
a
little
thing
for
flowers
wither
and
fade
but
the
fragrance
they
shed
is
not
soon
forgot
by
me
who
the
wreath
has
made
so
the
virtues
of
those
who
have
gone
before
will
always
be
treasured
in
memory
store
epitaph
our
loved
ones
lay
them
down
to
sleep
and
leave
us
here
to
grieve
and
mourn
while
we
our
silent
watches
keep
their
low
graves
whence
they
are
bourne
some
heroes
are
in
battle
slain
their
names
are
honored
far
and
near
while
others
die
on
beds
of
pain
and
no
sad
mourner
sheds
a
tear
this
day
we
honor
each
and
all
whose
soul
has
left
its
temporal
case
and
be
he
great
or
be
he
small
we
reverence

resting
place

masata
masata
was
an
indian
boy
he
lived
on
the
banks
of
the
ohio
river
in
kentucky
during
the
revolutionary
war
in
the
americans
were
taking
over
the
land
very
fast
and
when
masata
was
ten
years
old
his
parents
moved
to
the
wild
regions
of
the
dakotas
taking
masata
with
them
here
he
enjoyed
life
although
it
was
much
colder
than
in
his
native
kentucky
and
in
the
winter
months
he
wore
coats
of
fur
made
from
bear
skin
the
days
soon
became
filled
with
interesting
things
for
masata
one
day
when
he
was
roaming
through
the
wilds
he
heard
a
wild
buffalo
approaching
he
seemed
almost
helpless
as
he
had
nothing
but
a
small
bow
and
a
few
arrows
and
the
buffalo
was
only
a
short
distance
from
him
he
began
to
run
in
what
he
thought
was
the
direction
of
his
home
but
instead
he
was
going
in
the
opposite
way
in
a
few
minutes
he
saw
the
smoke
of
a
camp
fire
and
ran
toward
it
by
this
time
the
beast
was
very
close
to
him
and
he
was
almost
in
despair
when
the
buffalo
lurched
forward
then
rolled
over
dead
three
indians
hunting
near
by
had
hit
him
in
a
vital
spot
with
an
arrow
the
indians
belonged
to
a
tribe
which
was
his
father
most
bitter
enemy
and
they
took
him
before
their
chief
the
chief
ordered
that
he
be
let
live
for
two
moons
and
he
was
given
a
bed
of
dry
twigs
to
sleep
on
as
the
night
was
drawing
near
time
passed
quietly
for
masata
until
the
approach
of
the
morning
of
the
second
moon
he
had
been
planning
how
he
would
escape
from
his
enemies
finally
one
morning
he
slipped
into
a
bear
skin
and
hopped
bravely
off
toward
the
woods
the
indians
thinking
he
was
a
bear
shot
arrows
at
him
and
wounded
him
in
the
right
arm
but
masata
kept
bravely
on
and
was
soon
out
of
range
of
the
arrows
then
he
bandaged
his
wounded
arm
the
best
he
could
and
set
out
for
his
father
wigwam
he
arrived
safely
the
same
evening
and
his
parents
were
overjoyed
to
see
him
and
know
he
was
safe
once
more
and
the
tribe
made
a
great
feast
or
as
they
call
it
pow
wow
as
a
welcome
to
his
home
coming
while
masata
was
still
a
young
brave
their
chief
died
and
after
a
great
ceremony
masata
was
made
chief
of
the
tribes
and
was
known
as
great
and
good
ruler
