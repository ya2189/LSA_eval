guerriers
du

as
gautier
would
have
called
us
there
is
none
whose
love
of
art
is
more
flawless
and
fervent
whose
artistic
sense
of
beauty
is
more
subtle
and
more
delicate
none
indeed
who
is
dearer
to
myself
than
the
young
poet
whose
verses
i
have
brought
with
me
to
america
verses
full
of
sweet
sadness
and
yet
full
of
joy
for
the
most
joyous
poet
is
not
he
who
sows
the
desolate
highways
of
this
world
with
the
barren
seed
of
laughter
but
he
who
makes
his
sorrow
most
musical
this
indeed
being
the
meaning
of
joy
in
art
that
incommunicable
element
of
artistic
delight
which
in
poetry
for
instance
comes
from
what
keats
called
the
sensuous
life
of
verse
the
element
of
song
in
the
singing
made
so
pleasurable
to
us
by
that
wonder
of
motion
which
often
has
its
origin
in
mere
musical
impulse
and
in
painting
is
to
be
sought
for
from
the
subject
never
but
from
the
pictorial
charm
only
the
scheme
and
symphony
of
the
colour
the
satisfying
beauty
of
the
design
so
that
the
ultimate
expression
of
our
artistic
movement
in
painting
has
been
not
in
the
spiritual
visions
of
the
for
all
their
marvel
of
greek
legend
and
their
mystery
of
italian
song
but
in
the
work
of
such
men
as
whistler
and
albert
moore
who
have
raised
design
and
colour
to
the
ideal
level
of
poetry
and
music
for
the
quality
of
their
exquisite
painting
comes
from
the
mere
inventive
and
creative
handling
of
lime
and
colour
from
a
certain
form
and
choice
of
beautiful
workmanship
which
rejecting
all
literary
reminiscence
and
all
metaphysical
idea
is
in
itself
entirely
satisfying
to
the
æsthetic
sense
is
as
the
greeks
would
say
an
end
in
itself
the
effect
of
their
work
being
like
the
effect
given
to
us
by
music
for
music
is
the
art
in
which
form
and
matter
are
always
one
the
art
whose
subject
can
not
be
separated
from
the
method
of
its
expression
the
art
which
most
completely
realises
for
us
the
artistic
ideal
and
is
the
condition
to
which
all
the
other
arts
are
constantly
aspiring
now
this
increased
sense
of
the
absolutely
satisfying
value
of
beautiful
workmanship
this
recognition
of
the
primary
importance
of
the
sensuous
element
in
art
this
love
of
art
for
art
sake
is
the
point
in
which
we
of
the
younger
school
have
made
a
departure
from
the
teaching
of
ruskin
a
departure
definite
and
different
and
decisive
master
indeed
of
the
knowledge
of
all
noble
living
and
of
the
wisdom
of
all
spiritual
things
will
he
be
to
us
ever
seeing
that
it
was
he
who
by
the
magic
of
his
presence
and
the
music
of
his
lips
taught
us
at
oxford
that
enthusiasm
for
beauty
which
is
the
secret
of
hellenism
and
that
desire
for
creation
which
is
the
secret
of
life
and
filled
some
of
us
at
least
with
the
lofty
and
passionate
ambition
to
go
forth
into
far
and
fair
lands
with
some
message
for
the
nations
and
some
mission
for
the
world
and
yet
in
his
art
criticism
his
estimate
of
the
joyous
element
of
art
his
whole
method
of
approaching
art
we
are
no
longer
with
him
for
the
keystone
to
his
æsthetic
system
is
ethical
always
he
would
judge
of
a
picture
by
the
amount
of
noble
moral
ideas
it
expresses
but
to
us
the
channels
by
which
all
noble
work
in
painting
can
touch
and
does
touch
the
soul
are
not
those
of
truths
of
life
or
metaphysical
truths
to
him
perfection
of
workmanship
seems
but
the
symbol
of
pride
and
incompleteness
of
technical
resource
the
image
of
an
imagination
too
limitless
to
find
within
the
limits
of
form
its
complete
expression
or
of
a
love
too
simple
not
to
stammer
in
its
tale
but
to
us
the
rule
of
art
is
not
the
rule
of
morals
in
an
ethical
system
indeed
of
any
gentle
mercy
good
intentions
will
one
is
fain
to
fancy
have
their
recognition
but
of
those
that
would
enter
the
serene
house
of
beauty
the
question
that
we
ask
is
not
what
they
had
ever
meant
to
do
but
what
they
have
done
their
pathetic
intentions
are
of
no
value
to
us
but
their
realised
creations
only
moi
je
préfère
les
poètes
qui
font
des
vers
les
médecins
qui
sachent
guérir
les
peintres
qui
sachent
nor
in
looking
at
a
work
of
art
should
we
be
dreaming
of
what
it
symbolises
but
rather
loving
it
for
what
it
is
indeed
the
transcendental
spirit
is
alien
to
the
spirit
of
art
the
metaphysical
mind
of
asia
may
create
for
itself
the
monstrous
and
idol
but
to
the
greek
pure
artist
that
work
is
most
instinct
with
spiritual
life
which
conforms
most
closely
to
the
perfect
facts
of
physical
life
also
nor
in
its
primary
aspect
has
a
painting
for
instance
any
more
spiritual
message
or
meaning
for
us
than
a
blue
tile
from
the
wall
of
damascus
or
a
hitzen
vase
it
is
a
surface
nothing
more
and
affects
us
by
no
suggestion
stolen
from
philosophy
no
pathos
pilfered
from
literature
no
feeling
filched
from
a
poet
but
by
its
own
incommunicable
artistic
essence
by
that
selection
of
truth
which
we
call
style
and
that
relation
of
values
which
is
the
draughtsmanship
of
painting
by
the
whole
quality
of
the
workmanship
the
arabesque
of
the
design
the
splendour
of
the
colour
for
these
things
are
enough
to
stir
the
most
divine
and
remote
of
the
chords
which
make
music
in
our
soul
and
colour
indeed
is
of
itself
a
mystical
presence
on
things
and
tone
a
kind
of
sentiment
this
then
the
new
departure
of
our
younger
school
is
the
chief
characteristic
of
rennell
rodd
poetry
for
while
there
is
much
in
his
work
that
may
interest
the
intellect
much
that
will
excite
the
emotions
and
many
cadenced
chords
of
sweet
and
simple
sentiment
for
to
those
who
love
art
for
its
own
sake
all
other
things
are
added
yet
the
effect
which
they
preëminently
seek
to
produce
is
purely
an
artistic
one
such
a
poem
as
the
grave
with
all
its
majesty
of
melody
as
sonorous
and
as
strong
as
the
sea
by
whose
shores
it
was
thus
nobly
conceived
and
nobly
fashioned
or
the
little
poem
that
follows
it
whose
cunning
workmanship
wrought
with
such
an
artistic
sense
of
limitation
one
might
liken
to
the
rare
chasing
of
the
mirror
that
is
its
motive
or
in
a
church
pale
flower
of
one
of
those
exquisite
moments
when
all
things
except
the
moment
itself
seem
so
curiously
real
and
when
the
old
memories
of
forgotten
days
are
touched
and
made
tender
and
the
familiar
place
grows
fervent
and
solemn
suddenly
with
a
vision
of
the
undying
beauty
of
the
gods
that
died
or
the
scene
in
chartres
cathedral
sombre
silence
brooding
on
vault
and
arch
silent
people
kneeling
on
the
dust
of
the
desolate
pavement
as
the
young
priest
lifts
lord
christ
body
in
a
crystal
star
and
then
the
sudden
beams
of
scarlet
light
that
break
through
the
blazoned
window
and
smite
on
the
carven
screen
and
sudden
organ
peals
of
mighty
music
rolling
and
echoing
from
choir
to
canopy
and
from
spire
to
shaft
and
over
all
the
clear
glad
voice
of
a
singing
boy
affecting
one
as
a
thing
oversweet
and
striking
just
the
right
artistic
keynote
for
emotions
or
at
lanuvium
through
the
music
of
whose
lines
one
seems
to
hear
again
the
murmur
of
the
mantuan
bees
straying
down
from
their
own
green
valleys
and
inland
streams
to
find
what
honeyed
amber
the
might
be
hiding
or
the
poem
written
in
the
coliseum
which
gives
one
the
same
artistic
joy
that
one
gets
watching
a
handicraftsman
at
his
work
a
goldsmith
hammering
out
his
gold
into
those
thin
plates
as
delicate
as
the
petals
of
a
yellow
rose
or
drawing
it
out
into
the
long
wires
like
tangled
sunbeams
so
perfect
and
precious
is
the
mere
handling
of
it
or
the
little
lyric
interludes
that
break
in
here
and
there
like
the
singing
of
a
thrush
and
are
as
swift
and
as
sure
as
the
beating
of
a
bird
wing
as
light
and
bright
as
the
that
flutter
fitfully
down
to
the
orchard
grass
after
a
spring
shower
and
look
the
lovelier
for
the
rain
tears
lying
on
their
dainty
veinings
of
pink
and
pearl
or
the
sonnets
for
rodd
is
one
of
those
sonnent
le
as
the
ronsardists
used
to
say
that
one
called
on
the
border
hills
with
its
fiery
wonder
of
imagination
and
the
strange
beauty
of
its
eighth
line
or
the
one
which
tells
of
the
sorrow
of
the
great
king
for
the
little
dead
child
well
all
these
poems
aim
as
i
said
at
producing
a
purely
artistic
effect
and
have
the
rare
and
exquisite
quality
that
belongs
to
work
of
that
kind
and
i
feel
that
the
entire
subordination
in
our
æsthetic
movement
of
all
merely
emotional
and
intellectual
motives
to
the
vital
informing
poetic
principle
is
the
surest
sign
of
our
strength
but
it
is
not
enough
that
a
work
of
art
should
conform
to
the
æsthetic
demands
of
the
age
there
should
be
also
about
it
if
it
is
to
give
us
any
permanent
delight
the
impress
of
a
distinct
individuality
whatever
work
we
have
in
the
nineteenth
century
must
rest
on
the
two
poles
of
personality
and
perfection
and
so
in
this
little
volume
by
separating
the
earlier
and
more
simple
work
from
the
work
that
is
later
and
stronger
and
possesses
increased
technical
power
and
more
artistic
vision
one
might
weave
these
disconnected
poems
these
stray
and
scattered
threads
into
one
strand
of
life
noting
first
a
boy
mere
gladness
of
being
young
with
all
its
simple
joy
in
field
and
flower
in
sunlight
and
in
song
and
then
the
bitterness
of
sudden
sorrow
at
the
ending
by
death
of
one
of
the
brief
and
beautiful
friendships
of
one
youth
with
all
those
unanswered
longings
and
questionings
unsatisfied
by
which
we
vex
so
uselessly
the
marble
face
of
death
the
artistic
contrast
between
the
discontented
incompleteness
of
the
spirit
and
the
complete
perfection
of
the
style
that
expresses
it
forming
the
chief
element
of
the
æsthetic
charm
of
these
particular
poems
and
then
the
birth
of
love
and
all
the
wonder
and
the
fear
and
the
perilous
delight
of
one
on
whose
boyish
brows
the
little
wings
of
love
have
beaten
for
the
first
time
and
the
so
dainty
and
delicate
little
of
music
and
full
of
such
fragrance
and
freedom
that
they
might
all
be
sung
in
the
open
air
and
across
moving
water
and
then
autumn
coming
with
its
quireless
woods
and
odorous
decay
and
ruined
loveliness
love
lying
dead
and
the
sense
of
the
mere
pity
of
it
one
might
stop
there
for
from
a
young
poet
one
should
ask
for
no
deeper
chords
of
life
than
those
that
love
and
friendship
make
eternal
for
us
and
the
best
poems
in
this
volume
belong
clearly
to
a
later
time
a
time
when
these
real
experiences
become
absorbed
and
gathered
up
into
a
form
which
seems
from
such
real
experiences
to
be
the
most
alien
and
the
most
remote
when
the
simple
expression
of
joy
or
sorrow
suffices
no
longer
and
lives
rather
in
the
stateliness
of
the
cadenced
metre
in
the
music
and
colour
of
the
linked
words
than
in
any
direct
utterance
lives
one
might
say
in
the
perfection
of
the
form
more
than
in
the
pathos
of
the
feeling
and
yet
after
the
broken
music
of
love
and
the
burial
of
love
in
the
autumn
woods
we
can
trace
that
wandering
among
strange
people
and
in
lands
unknown
to
us
by
which
we
try
so
pathetically
to
heal
the
hurts
of
the
life
we
know
and
that
pure
and
passionate
devotion
to
art
which
one
gets
when
the
harsh
reality
of
life
has
too
suddenly
wounded
one
and
is
with
discontent
or
sorrow
marring
one
youth
just
as
often
i
think
as
one
gets
it
from
any
natural
joy
of
living
and
that
curious
intensity
of
vision
by
which
in
moments
of
sadness
and
despair
ungovernable
artistic
things
will
live
in
memory
with
a
vivid
realism
caught
from
the
life
which
they
help
one
to
forget
an
old
gray
tomb
in
flanders
with
a
strange
legend
on
it
making
one
think
how
perhaps
passion
does
live
on
after
death
a
necklace
of
blue
and
amber
beads
and
a
broken
mirror
found
in
a
girl
grave
at
rome
a
marble
image
of
a
boy
habited
like
erôs
and
with
the
pathetic
tradition
of
a
great
king
sorrow
lingering
about
it
like
a
purple
shadow
over
all
these
the
tired
spirit
broods
with
that
calm
and
certain
joy
that
one
gets
when
one
has
found
something
that
the
ages
never
dull
and
the
world
can
not
harm
and
with
it
comes
that
desire
of
greek
things
which
is
often
an
artistic
method
of
expressing
desire
for
perfection
and
that
longing
for
the
old
dead
days
which
is
so
modern
so
incomplete
so
touching
being
in
a
way
the
inverted
torch
of
hope
which
burns
the
hand
it
should
guide
and
for
many
things
a
little
sadness
and
for
all
things
a
great
love
and
lastly
in
the
by
the
sea
once
more
the
quick
and
vital
pulse
of
joyous
youth
leaping
and
laughing
in
every
line
the
frank
and
fearless
freedom
of
wave
and
wind
waking
into
fire
life
ashes
and
into
song
the
silent
lips
of
pain
how
clearly
one
seems
to
see
it
all
the
long
colonnade
of
pines
with
sea
and
sky
peeping
in
here
and
there
like
a
flitting
of
silver
the
open
place
in
the
green
deep
heart
of
the
wood
with
the
little
altar
to
the
old
italian
god
in
it
and
the
flowers
all
about
cyclamen
in
the
shadowy
places
and
the
stars
of
the
white
narcissus
lying
like
snowflakes
over
the
grass
where
the
quick
lizard
starts
by
the
stone
and
the
snake
lies
coiled
lazily
in
the
sun
on
the
hot
sand
and
overhead
the
gossamer
floats
from
the
branches
like
thin
tremulous
threads
of
gold
the
scene
is
so
perfect
for
its
motive
for
surely
here
if
anywhere
the
real
gladness
of
life
might
be
revealed
to
one
youth
the
gladness
that
comes
not
from
the
rejection
but
from
the
absorption
of
all
passion
and
is
like
that
serene
calm
that
dwells
in
the
faces
of
the
greek
statues
and
which
despair
and
sorrow
can
not
disturb
but
intensify
only
in
some
such
way
as
this
we
could
gather
up
these
strewn
and
scattered
petals
of
song
into
one
perfect
rose
of
life
and
yet
perhaps
in
so
doing
we
might
be
missing
the
true
quality
of
the
poems
one
real
life
is
so
often
the
life
that
one
does
not
lead
and
beautiful
poems
like
threads
of
beautiful
silks
may
be
woven
into
many
patterns
and
to
suit
many
designs
all
wonderful
and
all
different
and
romantic
poetry
too
is
essentially
the
poetry
of
impressions
being
like
that
latest
school
of
painting
the
school
of
whistler
and
albert
moore
in
its
choice
of
situation
as
opposed
to
subject
in
its
dealing
with
the
exceptions
rather
than
with
the
types
of
life
in
its
brief
intensity
in
what
one
might
call
its
momentariness
it
being
indeed
the
momentary
situations
of
life
the
momentary
aspects
of
nature
which
poetry
and
painting
now
seek
to
render
for
us
sincerity
and
constancy
will
the
artist
indeed
have
always
but
sincerity
in
art
is
merely
that
plastic
perfection
of
execution
without
which
a
poem
or
a
painting
however
noble
its
sentiment
or
human
its
origin
is
but
wasted
and
unreal
work
and
the
constancy
of
the
artist
can
not
be
to
any
definite
rule
or
system
of
living
but
to
that
principle
of
beauty
only
through
which
the
inconstant
shadows
of
his
life
are
in
their
most
fleeting
moment
arrested
and
made
permanent
he
will
not
for
instance
in
intellectual
matters
acquiesce
in
that
facile
orthodoxy
of
our
day
which
is
so
reasonable
and
so
artistically
uninteresting
nor
yet
will
he
desire
that
fiery
faith
of
the
antique
time
which
while
it
intensified
yet
limited
the
vision
still
less
will
he
allow
the
calm
of
his
culture
to
be
marred
by
the
discordant
despair
of
doubt
or
the
sadness
of
a
sterile
skepticism
for
the
valley
perilous
where
ignorant
armies
clash
by
night
is
no
meet
for
her
to
whom
the
gods
have
assigned
the
clear
upland
the
serene
height
and
the
sunlit
air
rather
will
he
be
always
curiously
testing
new
forms
of
belief
tinging
his
nature
with
the
sentiment
that
still
lingers
about
some
beautiful
creeds
and
searching
for
experience
itself
and
not
for
the
fruits
of
experience
when
he
has
got
its
secret
he
will
leave
without
regret
much
that
was
once
very
precious
to
him
i
am
always
insincere
says
emerson
somewhere
as
knowing
that
there
are
other
moods
wrote
théophile
gautier
once
in
a
review
of
arsène
houssaye
émotions
ne
se
ressemblent
pas
mais
être
ému
voilà
now
this
is
the
secret
of
the
art
of
the
modern
romantic
school
and
gives
one
the
right
keynote
for
its
apprehension
but
the
real
quality
of
all
work
which
like
rodd
aims
as
i
said
at
a
purely
artistic
effect
can
not
be
described
in
terms
of
intellectual
criticism
it
is
too
intangible
for
that
one
can
perhaps
convey
it
best
in
terms
of
the
other
arts
and
by
reference
to
them
and
indeed
some
of
these
poems
are
as
iridescent
and
as
exquisite
as
a
lovely
fragment
of
venetian
glass
others
as
delicate
in
perfect
workmanship
and
as
simple
in
natural
motive
as
an
etching
by
whistler
is
or
one
of
those
beautiful
little
greek
figures
which
in
the
olive
woods
round
tanagra
men
can
still
find
with
the
faint
gilding
and
the
fading
crimson
not
yet
fled
from
hair
and
lips
and
raiment
and
many
of
them
seem
like
one
of
corot
twilights
just
passing
into
music
for
not
merely
in
visible
colour
but
in
sentiment
also
which
is
the
colour
of
poetry
may
there
be
a
kind
of
tone
but
i
think
that
the
best
likeness
to
the
quality
of
this
young
work
i
ever
saw
was
in
the
landscape
by
the
loire
we
were
staying
once
he
and
i
at
amboise
that
little
village
with
its
roofs
and
steep
streets
and
gaunt
grim
gateway
where
the
quiet
cottages
nestle
like
white
pigeons
into
the
sombre
clefts
of
the
great
bastioned
rock
and
the
stately
renaissance
houses
stand
silent
and
apart
very
desolate
now
but
with
some
memory
of
the
old
days
still
lingering
about
the
pillars
and
the
carved
doorways
with
their
grotesque
animals
and
laughing
masks
and
quaint
heraldic
devices
all
reminding
one
of
a
people
who
could
not
think
life
real
till
they
had
made
it
fantastic
and
above
the
village
and
beyond
the
bend
of
the
river
we
used
to
go
in
the
afternoon
and
sketch
from
one
of
the
big
barges
that
bring
the
wine
in
autumn
and
the
wood
in
winter
down
to
the
sea
or
lie
in
the
long
grass
and
make
plans
la
gloire
et
pour
ennuyer
les
or
wander
along
the
low
sedgy
banks
matching
our
reeds
in
sportive
rivalry
as
comrades
used
in
the
old
sicilian
days
and
the
land
was
an
ordinary
land
enough
and
bare
too
when
one
thought
of
italy
and
how
the
oleanders
were
robing
the
hillsides
by
genoa
in
scarlet
and
the
cyclamen
filling
with
its
purple
every
valley
from
florence
to
rome
for
there
was
not
much
real
beauty
perhaps
in
it
only
long
white
dusty
roads
and
straight
rows
of
formal
poplars
but
now
and
then
some
little
breaking
gleam
of
broken
light
would
lend
to
the
gray
field
and
the
silent
barn
a
secret
and
a
mystery
that
were
hardly
their
own
would
transfigure
for
one
exquisite
moment
the
peasants
passing
down
through
the
vineyard
or
the
shepherd
watching
on
the
hill
would
tip
the
willows
with
silver
and
touch
the
river
into
gold
and
the
wonder
of
the
effect
with
the
strange
simplicity
of
the
material
always
seemed
to
me
to
be
a
little
like
the
quality
of
these
the
verses
of
my
friend
oscar
wilde
rose
leaf
and
apple
leaf
from
the
hill
of
gardens
the
outline
of
a
shadowy
city
spread
between
the
garden
and
the
distant
hill
and
yon
dome
the
lingers
still
set
like
the
glory
on
an
angel
head
the
light
fades
quivering
into
evening
blue
behind
the
on
ianiculum
the
swallow
whispered
to
the
swallow
come
and
took
the
sunset
on
her
wings
and
flew
one
rift
of
cloud
the
wind
caught
up
suspending
a
ruby
path
between
the
earth
and
sky
those
shreds
of
gold
are
angel
wings
ascending
from
where
the
sorrows
of
our
singers
lie
they
have
not
found
those
wandering
spirits
yet
but
seek
for
ever
in
the
red
sunset
pass
upward
angel
wings
seek
not
for
these
they
sit
not
in
the
graves
their
spirits
wander
over
moonlit
waves
and
sing
in
all
the
singing
of
the
seas
and
by
green
places
in
the
showers
and
in
the
of
flowers
some
shell
still
dewy
with
sea
foam
bear
back
to
whisper
where
their
feet
have
trod
they
are
the
earth
for
evermore
fly
home
and
lay
a
daisy
at
the
feet
of
god
in
the
coliseum
night
wanes
i
sit
in
the
ruin
alone
beneath
the
shadow
of
arches
falls
from
the
dim
outline
of
the
broken
walls
and
the
steals
the
stone
from
a
midway
arch
where
the
moon
looks
through
a
silver
shield
in
the
deep
deep
blue
this
is
the
hour
of
ghosts
that
rise
line
on
line
of
the
noiseless
dead
the
clouds
above
are
their
awning
spread
look
into
the
shadow
with
eyes
you
will
see
the
writhing
of
limbs
in
pain
and
the
whole
red
tragedy
over
again
the
ghostly
galleys
ride
out
and
meet
the
cæsar
sits
in
his
golden
chair
his
fingers
toy
with
his
women
hair
the
water
is
under
his
feet
till
the
owl
long
cry
dies
down
with
the
night
and
one
star
waits
for
the
dawning
light
rome
the
grave
high
over
the
wild
on
the
furthest
downs
to
the
west
is
the
green
of
the
norseman
with
the
grove
on
its
crest
and
i
heard
in
the
winds
his
story
as
they
leapt
up
salt
from
the
wave
and
tore
at
the
creaking
branches
that
grow
from
the
grave
some
son
of
the
vikings
the
wild
lords
who
sailed
in
a
galley
with
a
terror
of
twenty
swords
from
the
fiords
of
the
sunless
winter
they
came
on
an
icy
blast
till
over
the
whole
world
the
shadow
of
odin
passed
till
they
sped
to
the
inland
waters
and
under
the
skies
and
stared
on
the
puny
princes
with
their
blue
victorious
eyes
and
they
said
he
was
old
and
royal
and
a
warrior
all
his
days
but
the
king
who
had
slain
his
brother
lived
yet
in
the
island
ways
and
he
came
from
a
hundred
battles
and
died
in
his
last
wild
quest
for
he
said
i
will
have
my
vengeance
and
then
i
will
take
my
rest
he
had
passed
on
his
homeward
journey
and
the
king
of
the
isles
was
dead
he
had
drunken
the
draught
of
triumph
and
his
cup
was
the
head
and
he
spoke
of
the
song
and
feasting
and
the
gladness
of
things
to
be
and
three
days
over
the
waters
they
rowed
on
a
waveless
sea
till
a
small
cloud
rose
to
the
shoreward
and
a
gust
broke
out
of
the
cloud
and
the
spray
beat
over
the
rowers
and
the
murmur
of
winds
was
loud
with
the
voice
of
the
thunders
till
the
shuddering
air
grew
warm
and
the
day
was
as
dark
as
at
even
and
the
wild
god
rode
on
the
storm
but
the
old
man
laughed
in
the
thunder
as
he
set
his
casque
on
his
brow
and
he
waved
his
sword
in
the
lightnings
and
clung
to
the
painted
prow
and
the
shaft
of
the
quiver
flashed
out
from
the
skies
rang
down
on
his
harness
and
gleamed
in
his
fiery
eyes
and
his
mail
and
his
crested
helmet
and
his
hair
and
his
beard
burned
red
and
they
said
it
is
odin
calls
and
he
fell
and
they
found
him
dead
so
here
in
his
armoured
they
laid
him
down
to
his
rest
in
his
casque
with
the
antlers
and
the
long
grey
beard
on
his
breast
his
bier
was
the
spoil
of
the
islands
with
a
sail
for
a
shroud
beneath
and
an
oar
of
his
galley
and
his
battle
brand
in
the
sheath
and
they
buried
his
bow
beside
him
and
planted
the
grove
of
yew
for
the
grave
of
a
mighty
archer
one
tree
for
each
of
his
crew
where
the
flowerless
cliffs
are
sheerest
where
the
circle
and
swarm
and
the
rocks
are
at
war
with
the
waters
with
their
jagged
grey
teeth
in
the
storm
and
the
huge
atlantic
billows
sweep
in
and
the
mists
enclose
the
hill
with
the
mound
where
the
norseman
grows
a
roman
mirror
they
found
it
in
her
hollow
marble
bed
there
where
the
numberless
dead
cities
sleep
they
found
it
lying
where
the
spade
struck
deep
a
broken
mirror
by
a
maiden
dead
these
things
the
beads
she
wore
about
her
throat
alternate
blue
and
amber
all
untied
a
lamp
to
light
her
way
and
on
one
side
the
toll
men
pay
to
that
strange
no
trace
of
what
in
her
was
fair
only
the
record
of
long
years
grown
green
upon
the
mirror
lustreless
dead
sheen
grown
dim
at
last
when
all
else
withered
there
dead
broken
lustreless
it
keeps
for
me
one
picture
of
that
immemorial
land
for
oft
as
i
have
held
thee
in
my
hand
the
dull
bronze
brightens
and
i
dream
to
see
a
fair
face
gazing
in
thee
wondering
wise
and
one
marble
shoulder
all
the
while
strange
lips
that
whisper
till
her
own
lips
smile
and
all
the
mirror
laughs
about
her
eyes
it
was
well
thought
to
set
thee
there
so
she
might
smooth
the
windy
ripples
of
her
hair
and
knot
their
tangled
waywardness
or
ere
she
stood
before
the
queen
persephone
and
still
it
may
be
where
the
dead
folk
rest
she
holds
a
shadowy
mirror
to
her
eyes
and
looks
upon
the
changelessness
and
sighs
and
sets
the
dead
land
lilies
in
her
breast
by
the
south
sea
so
here
we
have
sat
by
the
sea
so
late
and
you
with
your
dreaming
eyes
have
argued
well
what
i
know
you
hate
till
even
my
own
dream
dies
yet
why
will
you
smile
at
my
old
white
years
when
love
was
a
gift
divine
when
songs
were
laughter
and
hope
and
tears
and
art
was
a
people
shrine
must
i
change
the
burdens
i
loved
to
sing
the
words
of
my
song
the
old
fair
thoughts
have
a
hollow
ring
my
faiths
have
been
dead
so
long
and
yet
to
have
known
that
one
did
not
know
to
have
dreamed
with
the
poet
priest
to
have
hope
to
feel
that
it
might
be
so
and
theirs
was
a
faith
at
least
when
the
priest
was
poet
and
hearts
were
fain
of
marvellous
things
to
dream
to
see
god
tears
in
a
cloud
of
rain
and
his
hair
on
a
gold
sunbeam
to
know
that
the
sons
of
the
old
sea
king
roamed
under
their
waves
at
will
to
have
heard
a
song
that
the
wood
gods
sing
on
the
other
side
of
the
hill
and
so
i
had
held
it
for
all
things
blend
in
the
world
great
harmony
that
they
served
an
end
to
an
and
were
of
the
things
that
be
but
now
ye
are
bidding
god
with
his
lore
upon
dusty
shelves
so
wise
ye
are
grown
ye
have
found
no
need
for
any
god
but
yourselves
ye
have
learnt
the
riddle
of
seas
and
sand
of
leaves
in
the
spring
uncurled
there
is
no
room
left
for
my
wonderland
in
the
whole
of
the
great
wide
world
and
what
have
ye
left
for
a
song
to
say
what
now
is
a
singer
fame
he
may
startle
the
ear
with
a
word
one
day
and
die
and
live
in
a
name
but
the
world
has
heed
unto
no
fair
thing
men
pass
on
their
soulless
ways
they
give
no
faith
unto
those
who
sing
give
hardly
a
heartless
praise
but
you
say
let
us
go
unto
all
wide
lands
let
us
speak
to
the
people
heart
let
us
make
good
use
of
our
lips
and
hands
there
is
hope
for
the
world
in
art
will
the
dull
ears
hear
will
the
dead
souls
see
will
they
know
what
we
hardly
know
the
chords
of
the
wonderful
harmony
of
the
earth
and
the
skies
if
so
we
have
talked
too
long
till
it
all
seems
vain
the
desire
and
the
hopes
that
fired
the
triumphs
won
and
the
needless
pain
and
the
heart
that
has
hoped
is
tired
do
you
see
down
there
where
the
high
cliffs
shrink
and
the
ripples
break
on
the
bay
our
old
sea
boat
at
the
white
foam
brink
with
the
sail
slackened
down
shall
we
get
hence
o
fair
heart
brother
you
are
weary
at
heart
with
me
we
two
alone
in
the
world
no
other
shall
we
go
to
our
wide
kind
sea
shall
we
glide
away
in
this
white
moon
track
does
it
not
seem
fair
in
your
eyes
to
drift
and
drift
with
our
white
sail
black
in
the
dreamful
light
of
the
skies
till
the
pale
stars
die
and
some
far
fair
shore
comes
up
through
the
morning
haze
and
wandering
hearts
shall
not
wander
more
far
off
from
the
mad
world
ways
or
still
more
fair
when
the
dim
scared
night
grows
pale
from
the
east
to
the
west
if
the
waters
gather
us
home
and
the
light
break
through
on
the
waves
unrest
and
there
in
the
gleam
of
the
sea
which
the
smile
of
the
morning
brings
our
souls
shall
fathom
the
mystery
and
the
riddle
of
all
these
things
in
a
church
this
was
the
first
shrine
lit
for
queen
marie
and
i
will
sit
a
little
at
her
feet
for
winds
without
howl
down
the
narrow
street
and
gather
from
the
westward
sea
sweet
here
to
watch
the
peasant
people
pray
while
through
the
window
falls
low
light
of
even
and
the
golden
walls
grow
dim
and
dreamful
at
the
end
of
day
till
from
these
columns
fades
their
marble
sheen
and
lines
grow
soft
and
mystical
these
wraiths
that
watch
the
service
of
the
changing
faiths
to
mary
mother
from
the
cyprian
queen
but
aye
for
me
this
colonnade
seems
open
to
blue
summer
skies
once
more
these
altars
pass
and
on
the
polished
floor
i
see
the
lines
of
chequered
light
and

leap

flash
the
rustling

yon

the
bare

there
is

the
haunting

of
the
place
ah
friar
with
the
shaven
face
the
saints
are
weary
of
thy
mumbled
prayer
from
matins
bell
to
the
slow
day

he
sits
and
thumbs
his
endless
round
of
beads
drawls
out
the
dreary
cadence
of
his
creeds
and
nods
assent
to
each
familiar
line

she
the
goddess
whose
white
star
is
set
whose
fane
was
pillaged
for
this
sombre
shrine
could
she
look
down
upon
those
lips
of
thine
and
hear
thee
mutter
would
she
still
regret
there
came
a
sound
of
singing
on
my
ear
and
slowly
glided
through
the
door
a
glimmer
of
grey
forms
like
ghosts
they
bore
a
dead
man
lying
on
his
purple
bier
some
poor
man
soul
so
little
candle
smoke
went
curling
upwards
by
the
uncased
shroud
and
then
a
sudden
broke
loud
and
drowned
the
droning
of
the
priest
who
spoke
so
all
the
shuffling
feet
passed
out
again
to
lightnings
flashing
through
the
wet
and
wind
and
while
i
lingered
in
the

spring
grew
to
perfect
summer
in
one
day
and
we
lay
there
among
the
vines
to
gaze
where
circe
isle
floats
purple
far
away
above
the
golden
haze
and
on
our
ears
there
seemed
to
rise
and
fall
the
burden
of
an
old
world
song
we
knew
that
sang
is
neptune
festival
and
we
what
shall
we
do
go
down
campagna

of
mine
and
bring
again
the
earthen
jar
that
lies
with
three
years
dust
above
the
mellow
wine
and
while
the
swift
day
dies
you
first
shall
sing
a
song
of
waters
blue
paphos
and
cnidos
in
the
summer
seas
and
one
who
guides
her
chariot
through
the
cyclades
and
i
will
take
the
second
turn
of
song
of
floating
tresses
in
the
foam

surge
where
nereid

about
the
throng
and
night
shall
have
her
dirge
if
any
one
return

would
we
had
carried
him
far
away
to
the
light
of
this
south
sun
land
where
the
hills
lean
down
to
some
bay
and
the
sea
blue
breaks
into
spray
as
the
wave
dies
out
on
the
sand
not
there
not
there
where
the
winds
deface
where
the
storm
and
the
cloud
race
by
but
far
away
in
this
flowerful
place
where
endless
summers
retouch
retrace
what
flowers
find
heart
to
die
and
if
ever
the
souls
of
the
loved
set
free
come
back
to
the
souls
that
stay
i
could
dream
he
would
sit
for
a
while
with
me
where
i
sit
by
this
wonderful
tideless
sea
and
look
to
the
bay
by
the
high
cliff
edge
where
the
wild
weeds
twine
and
he
would
not
speak
or
move
but
his
eyes
would
gaze
from
his
soul
at
mine
my
eyes
that
would
answer
without
one
sign
and
that
were
enough
for
love
and
i
think
i
should
feel
as
the
sun
went
round
that
he
was
not
there
any
more
but
dews
were
wet
on
the
mound
on
the
bed
of
my
love
lying
underground

it
was
a
tomb
in
flanders
old
and
grey
a
knight
in
armour
lying
dead
unknown
among
the
yet
the
stone
cried
out
for
vengeance
where
the
dead
man
lay
no
name
was
chiselled
at
his
side
to
say
what
wrongs
his
spirit
thirsted
to
atone
only
the
armour
with
green
moss
and
those
grim
words
no
years
had
worn
away
it
may
be
haply
in
the
songs
of
old
his
deeds
were
wonders
to
sweet
music
set
his
name
the
thunder
of
a
battle
call
among
the
things
forgotten
and
untold
his
only
record
is
the
dead
man
threat
an
hour
will
come
that
shall
atone
for
all
actea
when
the
last
bitterness
was
past
she
bore
her

her
fallen
pitiful
dead

lifted
up

would
not
kill
and
on
those
lips
of
his

no

head
which
she
found
lovely
still
her
cold
lips
closed
in
death
she
had
her
will
oh
wreck
of
the
lost
human
soul
left
free
to
gorge
the
beast
thy
mask
of
manhood
screened
because
one
living
thing
albeit
a
slave
shed
those
hot
tears
on
thy
dishonoured
grave

thy
curse
be
as
the
shoreless

this

decree
abide
the

countless

with
the
trace
of
fresh
tears
wet
upon
the
hard
cold
face
he
wept
because
a
little
child
had
died
they
set
a
marble
image
by
his
side
a
sculptured
eros
ready
for
the
chase
it
wore
the
dead
boy
features
and
the
grace
of
pretty
ways
that
were
the
old

and
so
he
smiled
grown
softer
now
and
tired
of
too
much
empire
and
it
seemed
a
joy
fondly
to
stroke
and
pet
the
curly
head
the
smooth
round
limbs
so
strangely
like
the
dead
to
kiss
the
white
lips
of
his
marble
boy

call
by
name

this
was
the
end
love
made
the
breath
the
last
long
sigh
that
ever
man
sighs
here
and
then
for
us
the
great
unanswered
fear
will
love
live
on
the
other
side
of
death
only
a
year
and
i
had
hoped
to
spend
a
life
of
pleasant
communing
to
be
a
kindred
spirit
holding
fast
to
thee
we
never
thought
that
love
had
such
an
end
this
was
the
end
love
made
for
our
delight
for
one
sweet
year
he
can
not
take
away
those
tapers
burning
in
the
dim
those
kneeling
women
with
a
cross
that
pray
and
there
beneath
green
leaves
and
lilies
white
beyond
the
reach
of
love
our
loved
one
lay
on
the
border
hills
so
the
dark
shadows
deepen
in
the
trees
that
crown
the
border
mountains
all
the
air
is
filled
with
phantasies
shaped
and
transfigured
in
the
sunset
glare
what
wildly
spurring
are
these
what
tossing
headgear
and
what
hair
what
lances
flashing
what
far
trumpet
blare
that
dies
along
the
desultory
breeze
slow
night
comes
creeping
with
her
misty
wings
up
to
the
hill
crest
where
the
yew
trees
grow
about
their
circle
clings
the
rumour
of
an
unrecorded
woe
old
as
the
battle
of
those
border
kings
slain
in
the
darkling
below
songs
long
after
i
see
your
white
arras
gliding
in
music
the
keys
long
drooping
lashes
hiding
a
blue
like
summer
seas
the
sweet
lips
wide
asunder
that
tremble
as
you
sing
i
could
not
choose
but
wonder
you
seemed
so
fair
a
thing
for
all
these
long
years
after
the
dream
has
never
died
i
still
can
hear
your
laughter
still
see
you
at
my
side
one
lily
hiding
under
the
waves
of
golden
hair
i
could
not
choose
but
wonder
you
were
so
strangely
fair
i
keep
the
flower
you
braided
among
those
waves
of
gold
the
leaves
are
sere
and
faded
and
like
our
love
grown
old
our
lives
have
lain
asunder
the
years
are
long
and
yet
i
could
not
choose
but
wonder
i
can
not
quite
forget
where
the
rhone
goes
down
to
the
sea
a
sweet
still
night
of
the
vintage
time
where
the
rhone
goes
down
to
the
sea
the
distant
sound
of
a
midnight
chime
comes
over
the
wave
to
me
only
the
hills
and
the
stars
bring
back
dreams
of
the
days
long
dead
while
the
rhone
goes
down
to
the
sea
the
years
are
long
and
the
world
is
wide
and
we
all
went
down
to
the
sea
the
ripples
splash
as
we
onward
glide
and
i
dream
they
are
here
with
me
all
lost
friends
whom
we
all
loved
so
in
the
old
mad
life
of
long
ago
who
all
went
down
to
the
sea
so
we
passed
in
the
golden
days
with
the
summer
down
to
the
sea
they
wander
still
over
weary
ways
and
come
not
again
to
me
i
am
here
alone
with
the
night
wind
sigh
the
fading
stars
and
a
dream
gone
by
and
the
rhone
going
down
to
the
sea
a
song
of
autumn
all
through
the
golden
weather
until
the
autumn
fell
our
lives
went
by
together
so
wildly
and
so
but
autumn
wind
uncloses
the
heart
of
all
your
flowers
i
think
as
with
the
roses
so
hath
it
been
with
ours
like
some
divided
river
your
ways
and
mine
will
be
to
drift
apart
for
ever
for
ever
till
the
sea
and
yet
for
one
word
spoken
one
whisper
of
regret
the
dream
had
not
been
broken
and
love
were
with
us
yet
ερωτοϛ

the
autumn
wind
goes
sighing
through
the
quivering
aspen
tree
the
swallows
will
be
flying
toward
their
summer
sea
the
grapes
begin
to
sweeten
on
the
trellised
vine
above
and
on
my
brows
have
beaten
the
little
wings
of
love
oh
wind
if
you
should
meet
her
you
will
whisper
all
i
sing
oh
swallow
fly
to
greet
her
and
bring
me
word
in
spring
atalanta
wait
not
along
the
shore
they
will
not
come
the
suns
go
down
beyond
the
windy
seas
those
weary
sails
shall
never
wing
them
home
this
white
foam
no
voice
from
these
on
any
landward
wind
that
dies
among
the
trees
gone
south
it
may
be
rudderless
astray
gone
where
the
winds
and
ocean
currents
bore
out
of
all
tracks
along
the
sea
highway
this
many
a
day
to
some
far
shore
where
never
wild
seas
break
or
any
fierce
winds
roar
for
there
are
lands
ye
never
recked
of
yet
between
the
blue
of
stormless
sea
and
sky
beyond
where
any
suns
of
yours
have
set
or
these
waves
fret
and
loud
winds
die
in
cloudless
summertide
where
those
far
islands
lie
they
will
not
come
for
on
the
coral
shore
the
good
ship
lies
by
little
waves
caressed
all
stormy
ways
and
wanderings
are
no
more
no
more
but
long
sweet
rest
in
cool
green
that
lie
along
the
west
or
if
beneath
far
fathom
depths
of
waves
she
lies
heeled
over
by
the
slow
tide
sweep
deep
down
where
never
any
swift
sea
raves
through
ocean
caves
a
dreaming
deep
of
softly
gliding
forms
a
glimmering
world
of
sleep
then
have
they
passed
beyond
the
outer
gate
through
death
to
knowledge
of
all
things
and
so
from
out
the
silence
of
their
unknown
fate
they
bid
us
wait
who
only
know
that
twixt
their
loves
and
ours
the
great
seas
ebb
and
flow
the
daisy
with
little
white
leaves
in
the
grasses
spread
wide
for
the
smile
of
the
sun
it
waits
till
the
daylight
passes
and
closes
them
one
by
one
i
have
asked
why
it
closed
at
even
and
i
know
what
it
wished
to
say
there
are
stars
all
night
in
the
heaven
and
i
am
the
star
of
day
when
i
am
dead
when
i
am
dead
my
spirit
shall
wander
far
and
free
through
realms
the
dead
inherit
of
earth
and
sky
and
sea
through
morning
dawn
and
gloaming
by
midnight
moons
at
will
by
shores
where
the
waves
are
foaming
by
seas
where
the
waves
are
still
i
following
late
behind
you
in
wingless
sleepless
flight
will
wander
till
i
find
you
in
sunshine
or
twilight
with
silent
kiss
for
greeting
on
lips
and
eyes
and
head
in
that
strange
shall
love
be
perfected
we
shall
lie
in
summer
breezes
and
pass
where
whirlwinds
go
and
the
northern
blast
that
freezes
shall
bear
us
with
the
snow
we
shall
stand
above
the
thunder
and
watch
the
lightnings
hurled
at
the
misty
mountains
under
of
the
dim
forsaken
world
we
shall
find
our
footsteps
traces
and
passing
hand
in
hand
by
old
familiar
places
we
shall
laugh
and
understand
after
heine
the
leaves
are
falling
falling
the
yellow
treetops
wave
ah
all
delight
and
beauty
is
drawing
to
the
grave
about
the
wood
crest
flicker
the
wan
sun
laggard
rays
they
are
the
parting
kisses
of
fleeting
summer
days
meseems
i
should
be
shedding
the
from
my
eyes
the
day
will
keep
recalling
the
time
of
our
i
knew
that
you
were
dying
and
i
must
pass
away
oh
i
was
the
waning
summer
and
you
were
the
wood
decay
those
days
are
long
departed
those
days
are
long
departed
gone
where
the
dead
dreams
are
since
we
two
children
started
to
look
for
the
morning
star
we
asked
our
way
of
the
swallow
in
his
language
that
we
knew
we
were
sad
we
could
not
follow
so
swift
the
blue
bird
flew
we
set
our
wherry
drifting
between
the
poplar
trees
and
the
banks
of
meadows
shifting
were
the
shores
of
unknown
seas
we
talked
of
the
white
snow
prairies
that
lie
by
the
northern
lights
and
of
woodlands
where
the
fairies
are
seen
in
the
moonlit
nights
till
one
long
day
was
over
and
we
grew
too
tired
to
roam
and
through
the
corn
and
clover
we
slowly
wandered
home
ah
child
with
love
and
laughter
we
had
journeyed
out
so
far
we
who
went
in
the
big
years
after
to
look
for
another
star
but
i
go
unbefriended
through
wind
and
rain
and
foam
one
day
was
hardly
ended
when
the
angel
took
you
home
a
there
was
a
night
when
you
and
i
looked
up
from
where
we
lay
when
we
were
children
and
the
sky
was
not
so
far
away
we
looked
toward
the
deep
dark
blue
beyond
our
window
bars
and
into
all
our
dreaming
drew
the
spirit
of
the
stars
we
did
not
see
the
world
asleep
we
were
already
there
we
did
not
find
the
way
so
steep
to
climb
that
starry
stair
and
faint
at
first
and
fitfully
then
sweet
and
shrill
and
near
we
heard
the
eternal
harmony
that
only
angels
hear
and
many
a
hue
of
many
a
gem
we
found
for
you
to
wear
and
many
a
shining
diadem
to
bind
about
your
hair
we
saw
beneath
us
faint
and
far
the
little
cloudlets
strewn
and
i
became
a
wandering
star
and
you
became
my
moon
ah
have
you
found
our
starry
skies
where
are
you
all
the
years
oh
moon
of
many
memories
oh
star
of
many
tears
after
heine
beautiful
fisherman
daughter
steer
in
your
bark
to
the
land
come
down
to
me
over
the
water
and
talk
to
me
hand
in
hand
lay
here
on
my
heart
those
tresses
for
look
what
have
you
to
fear
who
are
bold
with
the
sea
caresses
every
day
in
the
year
my
heart
is
at
one
with
the
deep
in
its
storm
in
its
ebb
and
flow
and
ah
there
are
pearls
asleep
in
cavernous
depths
below
after
heine
how
the
mirrored
moonbeams
quiver
on
the
waters
fall
and
rise
yet
the
moon
serene
as
ever
wanders
through
the
quiet
skies
like
the
mirrored
moonlight
fretting
are
the
dreams
i
have
of
you
for
my
heart
will
beat
forgetting
you
are
ever
calm
and
true
endymion
she
came
upon
me
in
the
middle
day
bowed
the
waters
of
a
mountain
mere
where
dimly
mirrored
in
the
ripple
play
i
saw
some
fair
thing
near
i
saw
the
waters
lapping
round
her
feet
the
widening
rings
spread
follow
out
and
die
i
saw
the
mirror
and
the
mirrored
meet
and
heard
a
voice
hard
by
so
i
endymion
who
lay
bathing
there
in
the
coolness
of
the
lake
looked
up
and
swept
away
my
long
wild
hair
and
knew
a
goddess
spake
a
form
white
limbed
and
peerless
far
above
the
very
fairest
of
imagined
things
the
perfect
vision
of
a
dream
of
love
stepped
through
the
that
breathed
soft
names
and
drew
me
to
her
arms
white
arms
and
clinging
in
a
long
caress
and
won
me
willing
by
the
magic
charms
of
perfect
loveliness
till
on
my
breast
a
throbbing
bosom
lies
the
dim
hills
waver
and
the
dark
woods
roll
for
all
the
longing
of
two
glorious
eyes
takes
hold
upon
my
soul
then
only
when
the
sudden
darkness
fell
upon
the
silver
of
the
mountain
mere
and
through
the
pine
trees
of
the
slanting
dell
the
moon
rose
cold
and
clear
i
seemed
alone
upon
the
dewy
shore
for
she
had
left
me
as
she
came
unwarned
and
fell
from
sighing
into
sleep
before
the
summer
morning
dawned
what
wonder
now
i
find
no
maiden
fair
who
dwells
between
these
mountains
and
the
seas
and
go
unloving
and
unloved
or
ere
i
turn
to
such
as
these
what
wonder
if
the
light
of
those
wide
eyes
makes
other
eyes
seem
cold
for
that
loud
laughter
lost
love
has
nothing
left
but
sighs
for
all
the
time
hereafter
yet
better
so
far
better
no
regret
can
touch
my
heart
for
that
sweet
memory
sake
but
only
sighing
for
the
sun
that
set
behind
the
summer
lake
but
yestermorn
it
was
the
second
night
comes
softly
stealing
over
yon
blue
steep
the
world
grows
silent
in
the
fading
light
there
is
no
joy
but
sleep
i
can
not
bear
her
fair
face
in
the
skies
beyond
the
drowsy
waving
of
the
trees
a
soft
breeze
kisses
round
my
heavy
eyes
a
restful
summer
breeze
what
means
this
dreamless
apathy
of
sleep
a
mist
steals
over
the
dim
lake
the
shore
until
my
closing
eyes
forget
to
weep
oh
let
me
wake
no
more
disillusion
ah
what
would
youth
be
doing
to
hoist
his
crimson
sails
to
leave
the
cooing
the
song
of
nightingales
to
leave
this
woodland
quiet
for
murmuring
winds
at
strife
for
waves
that
foam
and
riot
about
the
seas
of
life
from
still
bays
silver
sanded
wild
currents
hasten
down
to
rocks
where
ships
are
stranded
and
eddies
where
men
drown
far
out
by
hills
surrounded
is
the
golden
haven
gate
and
all
beyond
unbounded
are
shoreless
seas
of
fate
they
steer
for
those
far
highlands
across
the
summer
tide
and
dream
of
fairy
islands
upon
the
further
side
they
only
see
the
sunlight
the
flashing
of
gold
bars
but
the
other
side
is
moonlight
and
glimmer
of
pale
stars
they
will
not
heed
the
warning
blown
back
on
every
wind
for
hope
is
born
with
morning
the
secret
is
behind
whirled
through
in
wild
confusion
they
pass
the
narrow
strait
to
the
sea
of
disillusion
that
lies
beyond
the
gate
requiescat
he
had
the
poet
eyes
sing
to
him
sleeping
sweet
grace
of
low
replies
why
are
we
weeping
he
had
the
gentle
ways
fair
dreams
befall
him
beauty
through
all
his
days
then
why
recall
him
that
which
in
him
was
fair
still
shall
be
ours
yet
yet
my
heart
lies
there
under
the
flowers
in
chartres
cathedral
through
yonder
windows
stained
and
old
four
level
rays
of
red
and
gold
strike
down
the
twilight
dim
four
lifted
heads
are
aureoled
of
the
sculptured
cherubim
and
soft
like
sounds
on
faint
winds
blown
of
voices
dying
far
away
the
organ
dreamy
undertone
the
murmur
while
they
pray
and
i
sit
here
alone
alone
and
have
no
word
to
say
cling
closer
shadows
darker
yet
and
heart
be
happy
to
forget
and
now
the
mystic
silence
and
they
kneel
a
young
priest
lifts
a
star
of
gold
and
then
the
sudden
organ
peal
ave
and
ave
and
the
music
rolled
along
the
carven
wonder
of
the
choir
thrilled
canopy
and
spire
up
till
the
echoes
mingled
with
the
song
and
now
a
boy
flute
note
that
rings
shrill
sweet
and
long
ave
and
ave
louder
and
more
loud
rises
the
strain
he
sings
upon
the
angel
wings
right
up
to
god
and
you
that
sit
there
in
the
lowliest
place
with
lips
that
hardly
dare
to
move
you
with
the
old
sad
furrowed
face
dream
on
your
dream
of
love
for
you
glide
down
the
music
swell
the
folding
arms
of
peace
for
me
wild
thoughts
i
dare
not
tell
desires
that
never
cease
for
you
the
calm
the
angel
breast
whose
dim
foreknowledge
is
at
rest
for
me
the
beat
of
broken
wings
the
old
unanswered
questionings
hic
jacet
did
you
play
here
child
the
whole
spring
through
and
smiled
and
smiled
and
never
knew
where
the
shade
is
cool
and
the
grass
grows
deep
one
that
was
beautiful
lies
in
his
sleep
ah
no
child
never
will
he
arise
the
sleep
was
for
ever
that
closed
his
eyes
and
his
bed
is
strewn
deep
underground
he
was
tired
so
soon
and
now
sleeps
sound
when
the
first
birds
sing
we
can
hear
them
dear
and
in
early
spring
there
are
snowdrops
here
for
the
flowers
love
him
that
lies
below
and
ever
above
him
the
daisies
grow
shall
we
look
down
deep
where
he
hides
away
shall
we
find
him
asleep
yes
child
some
day
but
his
palace
gate
is
so
hard
to
see
we
two
must
wait
for
the
angel
key
at
tiber
mouth
the
low
plains
stretch
to
the
west
with
a
glimmer
of
rustling
weeds
where
the
waves
of
a
golden
river
wind
home
by
the
marshy
meads
and
the
strong
wind
born
of
the
sea
grows
faint
with
a
sickly
breath
as
it
stays
in
the
fretting
rushes
and
blows
on
the
dews
of
death
we
came
to
the
silent
city
in
the
glare
of
the
noontide
heat
when
the
sound
of
a
whisper
rang
through
the
length
of
the
lonely
street
no
tree
in
the
clefted
ruin
no
echo
of
song
nor
sound
but
the
dust
of
a
world
forgotten
lay
under
the
barren
ground
there
are
shrines
under
these
green
hillocks
to
the
beautiful
gods
that
sleep
where
they
prayed
in
the
stormy
season
for
lives
gone
out
on
the
deep
and
here
in
the
grave
street
sculptured
old
record
of
loves
and
tears
by
the
dust
of
the
nameless
slave
forgotten
a
thousand
years
not
ever
again
at
even
shall
ship
sail
in
on
the
breeze
where
the
hulls
of
their
gilded
galleys
came
home
from
a
hundred
seas
for
the
marsh
plants
grow
in
her
haven
the
marsh
birds
breed
in
her
bay
and
a
mile
to
the
shoreless
westward
the
water
has
passed
away
but
the
gathering
rushes
come
up
from
the
windy
shore
so
the
song
that
the
years
have
silenced
grows
musical
there
once
more
and
now
and
again
unburied
like
some
still
voice
from
the
dead
they
light
on
the
fallen
shoulder
and
the
lines
of
a
marble
head
but
we
went
from
the
sorrowful
city
and
wandered
away
at
will
and
thought
of
the
breathing
marble
and
the
words
that
are
music
still
how
full
were
their
lives
that
laboured
in
their
fetterless
strength
and
far
from
the
ways
that
our
feet
have
chosen
as
the
sunlight
is
from
the
star
they
clung
to
the
chance
and
promise
that
once
while
the
years
are
free
look
over
our
life
horizon
as
the
sun
looks
over
the
sea
but
we
wait
for
a
day
that
dawns
not
and
cry
for
unclouded
skies
and
while
we
are
deep
in
dreaming
the
light
that
was
us
dies
we
know
not
what
of
the
present
we
shall
stretch
out
our
hand
to
save
who
sing
of
the
life
we
long
for
and
not
of
the
life
we
have
and
yet
if
the
chance
were
with
us
to
gather
the
days
misspent
should
we
change
the
old
the
wandering
ways
we
went
they
were
strong
but
the
years
are
stronger
they
are
grown
but
a
name
that
thrills
and
the
wreck
of
their
marble
glory
lies
over
their
hills
so
a
shadow
fell
our
dreaming
for
the
weary
heart
of
the
past
for
the
seed
that
the
years
have
scattered
to
reap
so
little
at
last
and
we
went
to
the
forest
through
a
long
colonnade
of
pines
where
the
skies
peep
in
and
the
sea
with
a
flitting
of
silver
lines
and
we
came
on
an
open
place
in
the
green
deep
heart
of
the
wood
where
i
think
in
the
years
forgotten
an
altar
of
faunus
stood
from
a
spring
in
the
long
dark
grasses
two
rivulets
rise
and
run
by
the
length
of
their
sandy
borders
where
the
snake
lies
coiled
in
the
sun
and
the
stars
of
the
white
narcissus
lie
over
the
grass
like
snow
and
beyond
in
the
shadowy
places
the
crimson
cyclamens
grow
far
up
from
their
wave
home
yonder
the
murmuring
pass
the
branches
quiver
and
creak
and
the
lizard
starts
in
the
grass
and
we
lay
in
the
untrod
moss
and
pillowed
our
cheeks
with
flowers
while
the
sun
went
over
our
heads
and
we
took
no
count
of
the
hours
from
the
end
of
the
waving
branches
and
under
the
cloudless
blue
like
sunbeams
chained
for
a
banner
the
gossamers
flew
and
the
joy
of
the
woods
came
us
and
we
felt
that
our
world
was
young
with
the
gladness
of
years
unspent
and
the
sorrow
of
life
unsung
so
we
passed
with
a
sound
of
singing
along
to
the
seaward
way
where
the
sails
of
the
fishermen
folk
came
homeward
over
the
bay
for
a
cloud
grew
over
the
forest
and
darkened
the
shrine
and
the
hills
of
the
silent
city
were
only
a
ruby
line
but
the
sun
stood
still
on
the
waves
as
we
passed
from
the
fading
shores
and
shone
on
our
boat
red
bulwarks
and
the
golden
blades
of
the
oars
and
it
seemed
as
we
steered
for
the
sunset
that
we
passed
through
a
twilight
sea
from
the
gloom
of
a
world
forgotten
to
the
light
of
a
world

be

bibliographical

it
is
fair
to
accept
the
statement
of
his
wilde
own
ground
in
his
preface
to
the
decorative
verse

his
friend
rennell
rodd
though
one
doubts
whether
gautier
would
not
have
dubbed
the
twain
rather
than
guerriers

the

of

were
filled

them
with
a
ambition
to
go
forth
into
far
and
fair
lands
with
some
message
for
the
nations
and
some
mission
for
the
world
but
not
until
many
centuries

were
their
texts
illuminated

to

how

came
into

in
the
peculiar
which
has
long
since
set
it
apart
as

of

choicest
specimens
of
applied
æsthetics
in
that

has
to
offer
the

under
date
of
august
stoddart
wrote
as
follows
i
gladly
furnish
you
with
such
information
regarding
this
book
as
my
memory
of
a
quarter
of
a
century
permits
the
paper
used
in
the
de
was
a
remainder
which
we
found
in
the
possession
of
a
philadelphia
paper
dealer
charles
megargee
if
i
remember
correctly
and
was
made
at
the
famous
rittenhouse
mill
on
the
wissahickon
near
philadelphia
and
said
to
be
the
first
paper
mill
in
america
for
the
new
government
of
the
united
states
at
the
time
of
the
first
issue
of
bonds
or
paper
money
it
therefore
has
a
historical
interest
as
well
as
a
unique
character
i
think
this
edition
was
not
over
copies
and
price
but
brentano
sold
many
of
these
for
and
more
after
having
secured
wilde
autograph
on
the
cover
this
edition
is
now
certainly
out
of
print
and
so
far
as
i
know
impossible
to
procure
anywhere
i
have
heard
of
copies
changing
hands
at
the
cheaper
edition
was
issued
at
but
comparatively
few
sold
as
i
was
interested
in
greater
matters
and
transferred
the
stock
to
lippincott
where
the
lot
was
consumed
in
their
fire
i
think
the
whole
credit
for
the
green
leaves
and
the
general
oddity
of
the
of
the
book
belongs
to
our
office
altho
wilde
may
have
been
consulted
of
course
you
recognize
the
reproduction
of
his
seal
all
the
circumstances
connected
with
the
publication
of
leaf
and
apple
are
confessedly
not
entirely
clear
to
us
it
is
undoubtedly
true
as
stated
in
the
november
that
rennell
rodd
the
young
english
poet
whose
verses
were
brought
out
here
in
and
under
the
enthusiastic
auspices
of
oscar
wilde
has
altered
in
his
faith
he
now
disclaims
any
connection
with
the
æsthetic
school
and
lets
it
be
known
that
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
amazing
dress
in
which
his
verses
appeared
he
intends
to
publish
a
new
volume
this
newsy
note
was
based
on
a
briefer
one
made
just
two
weeks
earlier
in
london
november
viz
we
understand
that
rennell
rodd
has
a
new
volume
of
poems
in
the
press
he
is
anxious
to
disclaim
any
connection
with
the
æsthetic
school
with
which
he
has
been
identified
it
may
here
be
said
that
rodd
first
impressions
were
somewhat
different
from
what
the
above
implies
in
a
letter
dated
october
he
wrote
the
american
publisher
i
had
not
till
lately
seen
the
little
edition
which
is
charming
i
have
seen
no
de
in
england
to
compare
with
it
i
have
to
thank
you
for
the
great
care
and
delicacy
with
which
this
little
book
has
been
published
what
undoubtedly
precipitated
the
trouble
was
not
the
amazing
though
it
may
have
seemed
to
the
nameless
scribe
of
the
but
the
proposal
by
the
stoddart
firm
to
bring
out
an
english
edition
this
could
not
be
done
as
rodd
pointed
out
because
the
poems
had
already
been
published
in
london
and
as
he
held
the
copyright
they
could
not
be
reissued
save
with
his
consent
furthermore
since
i
have
read
the
introduction
i
am
not
over
pleased
at
the
way
in
which
i
find
myself
identified
with
much
that
i
have
no
sympathy
with
last
of
all
probably
first
of
all
there
is
one
thing
in
it
that
has
annoyed
me
excessively
and
had
i
had
a
proof
i
should
not
have
allowed
it
to
stand
the
dedication
is
too
effusive
i
have
written
to
wilde
on
this
score
but
if
he
does
not
write
to
you
i
must
ask
you
as
a
personal
favour
to
see
to
it
i
want
to
have
it
removed
from
all
copies
that
go
out
for
the
future
unfortunately
rodd
request
could
not
well
be
complied
with
the
book
had
been
published
and
as
it
turned
out
no
other
edition
was
ever
called
for
by
a
more
or
less
undiscerning
public
a
few
other
facts
are
in
evidence
the
original
title
of
the
work
as
published
by
rodd
through
david
bogue
london
was
in
the
and
the
dedication
read
to
my
father
it
is
conjectured
that
the
dedication
in
the
american
edition
was
either
based
on
or
copied
from
an
inscription
written
by
the
author
in
the
copy
wilde
brought
over
with
him
it
read
as
follows
oscar
wilde
hearts
brother
these
few
songs
and
many
songs
to
it
may
have
been
too
effusive
it
is
seldom
indeed
that
we
have
the
time
and
the
place
and
the
loved
one
all
together
it
is
not
denied
that
this
inscription
written
by
rodd
however
effusive
and
somehow
after
the
lapse
of
years
one
wishes
he
had
not
so
completely
discountenanced
the
kindly
offices
of
one
who
later
on
fell
into
such
desperate
extremes
it
is
quite
likely
that
the
evident
editing
bestowed
upon
the
poems
by
wilde
may
have
added
to
the
displeasure
of
the
poet
if
so
we
can
not
after
an
acquaintance
with
the
original
london
text
of
agree
with
him
two
poems
lucciole
and
maidenhair
omitted
by
wilde
attest
to
his
critical
acumen
and
nine
additional
poems
derived
we
may
suppose
from
manuscript
sources
do
not
lessen
our
respect
for
his
supervising
care
the
introduction
itself
was
without
question
a
matter
of
the
greatest
regret
to
rodd
it
credited
him
with
much
that
annoys
me
excessively
it
is
conceded
however
that
it
has
been
kindly
meant
but
if
a
second
edition
should
be
in
request
it
must
be
with
no
introduction
there
were
available
other
poems
that
could
be
made
to
take
its
place
admitting
that
wilde
went
beyond
the
spirit
if
not
the
letter
of
his
friend
intent
it
is
a
relief
to
find
rodd
admission
that
where
a
thing
has
been
kindly
meant
one
can
not
find
on
reflection
i
see
how
foolish
it
was
to
make
no
reservations
and
restrictions
of
any
kind
for
that
very
reason
i
have
no
excuse
to
make
any
complaint
but
still
harping
on
the
supposedly
bad
effects
of
wilde
it
did
not
occur
to
me
at
the
time
that
i
should
be
so
completely
identified
with
a
lot
of
opinions
with
which
i
have
no
sympathy
whatever
with
this
disclaimer
our
quotations
from
the
rodd
letters
come
to
an
end
well
after
all
is
said
what
does
it
matter
the
thing
we
care
for
most
is
just
this
brief
brilliant
essay
as
for
the
verse
it
is
in
the
main
well
and
good
despite
benefits
forgot
some
of
it
we
feel
assured
will
survive
has
indeed
lived
to
find
its
way
into
many
anthologies
as
for
the
exquisite
little
it
remains
to
us
safe
and
secure
veritable
of
unsullied
