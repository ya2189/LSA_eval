preface
my
publishers
suggested
the
bringing
together
of
the
three
poems
here
presented
to
the
reader
as
being
to
some
extent
alike
in
their
general
character
the
wonderful
shay
is
a
perfectly
intelligible
conception
whatever
material
difficulties
it
presents
it
is
conceivable
that
a
being
of
an
order
superior
to
humanity
should
so
understand
the
conditions
of
matter
that
he
could
construct
a
machine
which
should
go
to
pieces
if
not
into
its
constituent
atoms
at
a
given
moment
of
the
future
the
mind
may
take
a
certain
pleasure
in
this
picture
of
the
impossible
the
event
follows
as
a
logical
consequence
of
the
presupposed
condition
of
things
there
is
a
practical
lesson
to
be
got
out
of
the
story
observation
shows
us
in
what
point
any
particular
mechanism
is
most
likely
to
give
way
in
a
wagon
for
instance
the
weak
point
is
where
the
axle
enters
the
hub
or
nave
when
the
wagon
breaks
down
three
times
out
of
four
i
think
it
is
at
this
point
that
the
accident
occurs
the
workman
should
see
to
it
that
this
part
should
never
give
way
then
find
the
next
vulnerable
place
and
so
on
until
he
arrives
logically
at
the
perfect
result
attained
by
the
deacon
unquestionably
there
is
something
a
little
like
extravagance
in
how
the
old
horse
won
the
bet
which
taxes
the
credulity
of
experienced
horsemen
still
there
have
been
a
good
many
surprises
in
the
history
of
the
turf
and
the
trotting
course
the
godolphin
arabian
was
taken
from
ignoble
drudgery
to
become
the
patriarch
of
the
english
racing
stock
old
dutchman
was
transferred
from
between
the
shafts
of
a
cart
to
become
a
champion
of
the
american
trotters
in
his
time
old
blue
a
famous
boston
horse
of
the
early
decades
of
this
century
was
said
to
trot
a
mile
in
less
than
three
minutes
but
i
do
not
find
any
exact
record
of
his
achievements
those
who
have
followed
the
history
of
the
american
trotting
horse
are
aware
of
the
wonderful
development
of
speed
attained
in
these
last
years
the
lowest
time
as
yet
recorded
is
by
maud
in
if
there
are
any
anachronisms
or
other
inaccuracies
in
this
story
the
reader
will
please
to
remember
that
the
narrator
memory
is
liable
to
be
at
fault
and
if
the
event
recorded
interests
him
will
not
worry
over
any
little
slips
or
stumbles
the
terrible
witchcraft
drama
of
has
been
seriously
treated
as
it
well
deserves
to
be
the
story
has
been
told
in
two
large
volumes
by
the
rev
charles
wentworth
upham
and
in
a
small
and
more
succinct
volume
based
upon
his
work
by
his
caroline
upham
the
delusion
commonly
spoken
of
as
if
it
belonged
to
salem
was
more
widely
diffused
through
the
towns
of
essex
county
looking
upon
it
as
a
pitiful
and
long
dead
and
buried
superstition
i
trust
my
poem
will
no
more
offend
the
good
people
of
essex
county
than
tam
worries
the
honest

of

some

he
gives
a
twitch

her

you

now
and
then
as
a
car
goes
by
you
may
catch
a
gleam
from
her
wicked
eye
often
you
looked
on
a
rushing

just
what
moved
it
was

it

be
those
wires

that
made
it

you
could
guess
now
you
