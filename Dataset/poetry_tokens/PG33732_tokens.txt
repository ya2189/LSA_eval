and
with
the
farmer
be
very
nice
if
oats
you
offer
bid
very
low

they
are
light
the
moment
you

he
will
keep

show
him
a

extremely
shy

dull
it
is
the

on

a

that

despair
or
cause
a
gloom
he
fears
an

to
the

that
happen
on
a

day
then
from
the

to
keep

sometimes
locks
up
the

from
an

and
makes
him
sad
and
poor
a
country
house
and
a
new

gig
he
keeps
to
make
him
look
at
markets
big
soon
as
demands
upon

i
shant
attend
the

the
clerk
announce
his

inclined
to

and
when
for

you
may
on
him
call
leaves
norwich
mart
and
be
found
at
all
and
when
a
stoppage
happens
farmers
quake
then
cry
thought
that
such
a
man
would
break
to
take
off
merchants
i
am
quite
unwilling
at
first
set
off
some
are
not
worth
a
shilling
a
loss
at
sea
they
can
not
long
withstand
call
their
own
an
acre
of
good
land
yet
i
protest
pace
all
our
city
round
i
know
one
that
is
not
just
and
sound
they
deal
with
honour
and
are
men
of
trade
keep
up
their
payments
and
disdain
parade
at
times
a
farmer
often
do
complain
if
now
and
then
they
do
refuse
his
grain
sometimes
he
sells
a
sample
of
hard
beans
on
market
days
and
after
sends
his
teams
the
merchant
do
the
article
refuse
for
in
the
sacks
much
softer
grain
he
views
the
plain
he
the
bulk
admire
the
sample
was
improved
from
a
large
fire
soon
as
he
comes
to
where
he
do
set
up
of
london
porter
oft
he
takes
a
sup
the
sample
in
his
pocket
there
stay
by
a
good
fire
and
chat
two
hours
away
of
altering
samples
he
pays
no
regard
but
such
a
conduct
makes
the
sample
hard
then
he
complains
if
a
made
that
in
fault
you
can
not
him
persuade
friction
will
much
improve
most
sorts
of
grain
you
on
this
subject
no
longer
detain
on
l
leave
of
his
wife
and
was
sentenced
to
for
fourteen
from
life
hannah
farewell
bound
to
go
to
taste
the
bitter
draught
of
woe
and
as
i
view
that
starting
tear
it
drives
and
sinks
me
to
despair
and
now
i
take
a
last
farewell
the
grief
i
feel
no
one
can
tell
two
lovely
children
claims
my
care
to
clothe
them
with
despair
as
sorrow
only
on
them
press
they
are
doomed
to
wear
no
other
dress
we
little
thought
some
former
years
in
such
a
place
to
shed
our
tears
only
one
our
tears
can
dry
it
is
the
god
like
deity
and
he
can
all
our
griefs
expel
i
bid
this
last
farewell
these
fetters
he
can
quick
undo
and
send
me
back
to
live
with
you
may
hope
with
all
its
balmy
power
sooth
hannah
in
each
trying
hour
friendship
i
fear
will
from
you
flee
ere
i
am
riding
on
the
sea
for
the
rich
will
close
the
door
those
misfortune
maketh
poor
and
even
in
a
lucky
day
from
the
brightest
object
stray
and
those
injured
will
descry
your
falling
state
and
destiny
the
g
are
good
and
often
kind
to
those
where
troubles
press
the
mind
i
hope
when
i
am
gone
from
view
kind
friendship
they
will
show
to
you
great
confidence
they
placed
in
me
till
lured
by
worldly
gaiety
suspicion
on
me
its
dart
on
a
sudden
to
depart
from
children
home
and
hannah
too
disgraced
i
fled
from
public
view
but
justice
has
a
piercing
eye
her
runners
quick
did
me
espy
most
fairly
tried
guilty
found
calmly
i
heard
the
dreadful
sound
that
ushered
to
my
anxious
heart
that
i
from
hannah
must
depart
for
fourteen
years
ere
i
shall
see
my
troubles
and
liberty
to
god
my
fate
and
life
i
trust
what
he
ordains
i
know
is
just
a
man
from
honour
stray
by
vice
easy
led
away
to
every
wicked
artful
plan
that
soon
entraps
the
falling
man
and
what
increase
foreboding
tears
my
little
ones
are
come
of
years
when
they
demand
a
aid
methinks
i
hear
it
justly
said
i
ought
that
thought
before
possess
ere
i
my
wife
and
them
distress
extravagance
have
been
the
cause
that
made
me
act
against
the
laws
and
you
that
dress
in
rich
attire
and
only
flippant
things
admire
extravagance
will
oft
too
late
cause
you
to
mourn
a
culprits
fate
the
name
of
felon
oft
i
hear
that
very
name
increase
despair
and
as
i
now
my
fetters
view
i
dread
what
shortly
will
ensue
methinks
i
hear
the
goaler
say
this
day
from
her
you
go
away
from
britons
happy
peaceful
shore
my
wife
and
home
to
see
no
more
till
fourteen
years
are
away
i
shall
not
see
a
happy
day
oh
should
that
happy
time
return
then
will
my
heart
with
rapture
burn
at
such
a
time
my
wife
to
view
would
every
care
of
life
subdue
my
children
to
my
arms
press
and
never
more
cause
their
distress
hope
gently
wispers
to
my
heart
that
ere
i
long
from
you
depart
those
i
have
injured
will
obtain
a
mandate
to
unloose
the
chain
and
as
they
view
your
wretched
state
mourn
an
absent
fate
seldom
they
ever
sue
in
vain
to
our
loved
prince
but
mostly
gain
a
respite
from
the
pangs
of
grief
or
gain
an
order
for
relief
borne
the
unfeeling
keen
reproach
some
said
i
longed
to
keep
a
coach
that
i
in
tendom
oft
did
ride
with
all
an
upstarts
sullen
pride
pride
that
led
me
to
disgrace
i
took
what
i
could
not
replace
had
i
a
million
that
give
with
you
in
future
for
to
live
oh
hannah
are
you
come
again
to
sooth
my
woe
and
ease
my
pain
your
cheeks
furrowed
with
sad
tears
come
gentle
hope

those
fears
that
do
her
tender
frame

oh
god
make
sufferings
less
my
last
of
efforts
unless
prove
my
doom
i

fixed
above
no
intercession

obtain
a
respite
from
this
galling
chain

to
waste
some
years

far
from
you
upon
the

oh
keen
distress
with
every
ill
obtrude
on
me
the
bitter
pill
while
life
remains
hope
will
divest
a
gloomy
thought
it
feeds
the
wound
yet
known
no
cure
and
often
makes
us
more
indure
sometimes
it
lulls
us
into
sleep
and
for
a
time
our
senses
steep
and
like
a
pleasing
dream
obtain
a
short
abatement
from
our
pain
soon
as
it
vanish
from
our
view
our
earthly
troubles
rise
anew
till
death
unwelcome
strikes
his
dart
and
ease
the
captives
aching
heart
but
oh
that
awful
coming
day
that
every
mortals
crimes
display
what
creatures
shall
we
then
appear
the
decree
we
all
must
hear
may
every
soul
tried
above
from
christ
obtain
our
love
oh
god
i
hear
the
dreadful
call
prepare
prepare
ye
felons
all
oh
let
me
take
a
last
imbrace
summoned
all
appear
in
haste
farewell
by
j
parkerson
junr
farewell
ye
partner
of
my
woes
farewell
the
finest
language
can
but
faintly
tell
what
i
now
feel
in
writing
the
adieu
what
you
must
suffer
when
far
from
you
there
was
a
time
when
happiness
my
lot
i
serenely
in
my
little
cot
no
wicked
thoughts
did
then
disturb
my
rest
my
children
round
me
by
a
father
prest
no
father
now
methinks
i
hear
them
say
gone
from
us
hurried
far
away
nightly
them
in
my
dreams
seen
their
wet
eyes
and
heard
their
dreadful
screams
methought
my
wife
came
to
my
lonely
cell
to
say
adieu
to
bid
a
long
farewell
soon
i
awoke
and
to
increase
my
pains
i
felt
my
legs
round
with
chains
then
then
i
cried
oh
drunkenness
thou
cause
of
this
distress
and
make
me
break
those
laws
that
wise
men
made
for
every
man
to
keep
by
them
deluded
in
crimes
so
deep
first
step
to
ruin
was
a
love
of
dice
with
cards
the
great
promoter
of
our
vice
i
wish
those
men
who
do
with
such
things
play
would
ever
cast
them
from
their
hands
away
i
wish
all
magistrates
would
search
around
and
punish
publicans
where
they
are
found
they
me
first
my
master
to
neglect
and
after
lost
me
honest
respect
they
also
led
me
from
a
virtuous
wife
and
mostly
caused
my
sad
disgrace
and
strife
view
public
houses
every
wealthy
squire
and
force
by
ten
the
spendthrift
to
retire
by
such
a
plan
the
labouring
poor
would
rise
soon
as
the
sun
adorns
the
heavenly
skies
stated
what
have
brought
me
to
this
end
and
what
has
lost
me
every
earthly
friend
except
a
god
protect
and
bless
her
and
our
offspring
now
in
great
distress
young
men
be
cautious
how
you
spend
your
time
a
bad
acquaintance
hurries
on
a
crime
sometimes
an
artful
female
tries
her
power
to
trap
the
giddy
in
a
thoughtless
hour
when
she
has
the
captive
to
her
will
she
gladly
sees
you
taking
pill
cause
you
to
leave
a
virtuous
homely
wife
and
lead
a
sad
disgraceful
wicked
life
by
art
bring
you
to
distress
and
like
a
millwood
to
you
falsely
press
then
be
the
first
your
actions
to
betray
a
fiend
like
such
me
to
go
astray
from
them
i
love
from
those
my
heart
hold
dear
and
shall
till
death
their
memories
revere
when
i
am
in
transport
on
the
sea
doubtless
my
love
sometimes
sigh
for
me
bring
up
my
little
ones
in
such
a
way
as
they
will
holy
keep
the
early
in
life
do
in
their
minds
reveal
the
dreadful
crimes
to
swear
to
lie
or
steal
hannah
my
eldest
daughter
place
her
where
constant
under
eye
and
care
let
her
not
learn
the
weaving
trade
find
that
such
a
course
may
injure
much
her
mind
females
are
ready
to
acquire
that
art
soon
as
they
wish
fair
virtue
to
depart
unwilling
oft
in
service
for
to
be
where
they
dress
and
have
their
liberty
but
if
with
parents
they
can
work
at
home
nightly
they
hope
with
idle
folks
to
roam
at
my
late
sentence
i
can
not
complain
the
law
my
body
do
detain
justice
slow
has
overtaken
me
abroad
for
life
i
shall
he
kept
from
thee
on
a
just
god
for
ever
i
will
trust
i
know
his
will
is
always
right
and
just
tis
now
too
late
again
to
speak
to
you
which
is
the
cause
of
writing
this
adieu
no
partner
now
to
sooth
my
aching
heart
reflection
galls
me
at
myself
i
start
with
aching
heart
and
in
my
lonely
cell
i
bid
my
babes
and
you
long
farewell
methink
i
see
the
transport
full
in
view
and
i
with
horror
meet
the
crew
full
well
i
know
i
shall
see
you
more
nor
plant
a
footstep
on
my
native
shore
on
foreign
land
my
days
to
toil
and
with
vile
wretches
cultivate
the
soil
stripes
i
must
bare
perhaps
when
quite
unwell
and
hear
the
melancholy
yell
a
pang
i
fell
when
i
close
the
night
and
wish
a
virtuous
wife
was
in
my
sight
england
adieu
may
you
in
trade
increase
and
free
from
inward
tumults
rest
in
peace
our
chaplain
well
i
know
will
soon
impart
his
friendly
aid
to
cheer
the
drooping
heart
i
hope
my
children
he
will
learn
to
read
and
teach
them
early
to
peruse
the
creed
the
bell
is
rung
the
waggon
is
in
view
wife
and
dear
children
now
adieu
adieu
at
thoughts
of
leaving
this
my
native
shore
unmans
me
quite
and
i
can
say
no
more
i
will
life
a
better
course
pursue
far
away
shall
leave
my
heart
with
you
advice
vile
man
abstain
from
every
artful
plan
when
found
out
disgrace
the
name
of
man
let
those
who
steal
repent
and
sin
no
more
ere
law
decrees
its
vengeance
on
them
pour
from
trifling
things
we
greater
ills
pursue
till
the
fangs
are
brought
within
our
view
stop
stop
bad
courses
ere
it
be
too
late
and
justice
dooms
you
to
a
culprits
fate
riots
avoid
mischief
none
you
do
your
being
at
them
brings
a
stain
on
you
those
who
look
on
will
afterwards
repent
and
share
alike
in
point
of
punishment
the
law
expressly
properly
declare
he
adds
to
tumult
that
is
present
there
take
my
advice
let
reason
bear
her
sway
from
scenes
of
discord
always
keep
away
think
it
hard
a
worthless
savage
crew
should
gain
by
plunder
all
your
goods
from
you
the
worst
of
men
are
foremost
on
a
plan
to
gain
by
rapine
every
way
they
can
do
you
suppose
that
wasting
others
store
can
ease
the
hardships
of
the
labouring
poor
no
such
a
course
our
present
ills
increase
and
robs
the
nation
of
its
inward
peace
from
late
example
all
are
taught
to
know
dreadful
his
fate
that
strikes
blow
then
let
us
quiet
at
our
cots
remain
and
better
times
will
cheer
us
once
again
all
means
of
trying
comforts
to
restore
to
ease
the
hardships
of
the
labouring
poor
think
what
distress
awaits
dishonest
ways
in
prison
many
wretched
days
not
only
days
perhaps
they
shed
their
tears
in
foreign
lands
for
many
dismal
years
not
only
years
perhaps
are
for
life
abroad
to
roam
from
children
home
and
wife
should
it
your
lot
in
prison
for
to
be
implore
with
fervent
prayer
the
deity
who
will
in
time
if
you
sincerely
pray
lessen
your
troubles
each
succeeding
day
our
aid
that
we
should
crave
a
gracious
pardon
ere
we
meet
the
grave
his
intercession
with
the
king
of
kings
alone
can
save
you
from
eternal
stings
when
at
the
court
for
trial
you
appear
speak
nought
but
truth
you
better
for
it
fare
for
should
you
dare
to
introduce
a
lie
sharp
eye
each
falsehood
will
descry
the
guilty
felon
of
his
crime
is
clear
he
feels
alas
too
late
such
impious
conduct
greatly
aggravate
besides
he
answers
at
the
awful
day
for
causing
others
from
the
truth
to
stray
whatever
happens
in
this
vale
of
tears
our
maker
knows
give
him
your
fervent
prayers
let
your
demeanor
if
in
prison
be
such
as
the
jailor
can
contrition
see
for
his
report
may
mitigate
your
doom
and
sometimes
save
you
from
a
gloom
religious
books
if
you
can
read
attend
they
are
in
solitude
the
friend
when
at
the
chapel
do
not
cast
away
by
inattention
what
the
chaplain
say
pure
religion
cheers
each
good
heart
and
will
in
time
its
blessings
soon
impart
such
as
perhaps
you

not

would

of
an
hardened
prince
three
men
were
by
the
law
to
die
to
hear
them
mourn
to
see
the
drooping
eye
would
cause
sensations
of
a
painful
kind
while
anxious
cares
corode
the
mind
a
pious
chaplain
strove
to
bring
in
view
the
pardon
if
repentants
true
he
said
that
god
was
merciful
and
just
to
implore
forgiveness
on
his
word
to
trust
there
is
a
record
where
the
scripture
say
those
that
repent
he
will
not
cast
away
a
sigh
or
tear
can
not
that
boon
impart
it
must
be
fervent
from
the
head
and

vile
sinners
doth

true

ere
they
meet
the
grave

they
could
recal
the

would

if
each
day
the
last
just
before
death
they
me
to
implore
an
erring
mortal
to
transgress
no
more
hope
their
chaplain
might
for
ever
be
when
on
high
blessed
to
eternity
they
knew
his
worth
his
heart
is
of
a
kind
that
plants
soft
pity
to
a
feeling
mind
deeker
as
chaplain
few
can
excel

all

bids
the

farewell
when
first
i
saw
those
wretched
men
in
jail
before
their
trial
did
their
fate
bewail
soon
as
the
sentence
met
each
anxious
ear
and
true
repentants
did
appear
one
and
all
cried
out
oh
that
god
how
just
to
stop
our
sad
career
on
thee
trust
one

his

they
will
with
us

he

applause

all
his

for

on

his

powers
none

subdue
a

his

would
allow
seek
domestic
joy
to
stern
afflictions
to
bow
and
that
all
peace
destroy
his
loss
we
ever
shall
deplore
and
may
his
spirit
rest
with
virtuous
souls
long
before
and

as
you

here
i

i

i

my

you

hope
your

pay
a

on

into

fertile
land
corn
laws
are
needless
i
protest
to

then

at

a

the

out

him
