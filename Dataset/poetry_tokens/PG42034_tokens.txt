a
preface
most
of
the
poems
collected
in
this
volume
have
already
seen
the
light
of
print
in
the
the
monthly
publication
of
the
andiron
club
of
new
york
university
the
effort
of
the
author
has
not
been
to
write
verses
especially
adapted
to
the
taste
of
the
modern
public
but
rather
to
create
a
thing
of
beauty
from
the
theme
that
filled
his
mind
at
the
time
often
he
has
been
led
into
somewhat
bold
innovations
such
as
the
invention
of
the
miniature
ode
and
the
associating
of
an
idea
with
a
in
the
metrical
while
he
hopes
that
the
new
forms
will
justify
themselves
he
realizes
that
after
all
the
poems
must
stand
or
fall
in
proportion
to
the
amount
of
pure
artistic
beauty
contained
within
them

a

with
gold

fain
would

lie

breath
has
tinged
the
sky
mounting
in
faintly
flushing
shafts
on
high
to
tell
the
world
that
phoebus
is
at
hand
and
all
the
hours
in
a
glittering
band
cluster
around
in
sweeping
circling
flight
like
angels
bathing
in
celestial
light
see
now
with
one
great
shaft
of
molten
gold
no
longer
vaporous
haze
around
him
rolled
the
king
of
day
mounts
the
ethereal
height
scattering
the
last
dim
streamers
of
the
night
bow
down
ye
persians
on
your
altared
hills
worship
the
who
gives
life
and
fills
your
horn
with
plenteous
blessings
from
on
high
wake
wake
before
the
dawning
sunbeams
die
fling
incense
on
your
temple
dying
flame
sing
chants
and
chorals
in
his
mighty
name
for
as
a
weary
traveler
from
afar
or
as
a
sailor
on
the
harbor
bar
after
long
absence
spies
his
native
town
so
with
benignant
brilliance
smiles
he
down
or
like
a
good
king
ruling
his
land
he
sprinkles
blessings
with
a
bounteous
hand
and
thou
o
my
beloved
wake
arise
has
not
the
sun
illumined
night
dull
skies
come
phoebus
breath
has
tinged
the
summer
morn
come
see
the
light
shafts
waver
the
corn
come
see
the
early
lily
opening
bloom
come
see
the
wavering
light
expel
the
gloom
from
yon
dark
vale
still
sunk
in
misty
night
oh
watch
the
circling
skylark
heavenward
flight
as
wrapped
in
hazy
waves
of
shimmering
light
in
one
grand
jubilate
to
the
sun
he
floods
the
sky
with
song
of
day
begun
but
golden
morn
is
never
truly
fair
unless
with
day
thou
to
weave
my
hair
with
perfumed
flowers
gathered
in
the
dell
where
sylphs
sing
sweetly
the
bubbling
well
oh
fill
my
cup
of
pleasure
with
new
wine
which
sparkles
only
where
thy
soft
eyes
shine
o
my
beloved
haste
thee
to
arise
before
the
light
has
scorched
the
noonday
skies
the
fleeting
hours
haste
the
falling
sun
and
soon
the
of
life
is
run
the
song
of
lorenzo
over
thy
balcony
leaning
thy
languorous
glance
floats
below
whence
arise
thousand
odours
thine
incense
o
goddess
of
woe
a
star
from
the
infinite
whirling
taking
flight
through
the
dimness
of
night
in
an
ark
through
the
ether
is
curling
and
touches
thy
hair
with
its
light
o
lady
of
sadness
and
sorrow
mine
anguish
my
hope
my
despair
will
the
day
of
find
thee
still
in
that
balcony
there
near
thy
casement
an
ancient
vine
groweth
a
ladder
that
leads
thee
below
were
it
not
for
that
vine
ah
who
knoweth
thou
wert
not
an
of
woe
come
down
from
thy
chamber
not
yet
has
the
moon
lit
the
sky
on
the
carefully
clamber
is
it
thou
or
the
wind
that
doth
sigh
among
the
copse
hedges
then
darting
like
a
ghost
at
the
dawn
of
the
day
then
far
in
the
distance
departing
in
triumph
i
bear
thee
away
the
song
of
wo
hou
the
second
act
of
kwang
list
o
list
to
the
song
i
sing
to
the
varying
note
of
the
sighing
breeze
blowing
in
cool
refreshing
waves
from
the
endless
realm
of
the
seven
seas
waste
not
life
in
pursuit
of
war
holding
the
nations
for
one
short
day
for
the
death
of
the
king
destroys
the
realm
which
vanishes
like
the
great
mongol
sway
nor
hoard
up
silver
in
thy
vaults
for
the
silver
once
spent
the
pleasure
is
passed
or
before
it
is
spent
we
will
mourn
thy
death
in
the
world
neither
conquest
nor
silver
last
seek
o
seek
but
an
hour
joy
pleasure
and
love
though
they
may
not
endure
will
soothe
life
sorrow
and
bitterness
the
present
alone
of
all
time
is
sure
live
in
the
circle
of
mine
arms
live
in
the
light
of
the
love
in
mine
eye
live
in
the
music
of
my
song
and
as
the
music
of
my
song
die
the
aurora
night
in
purple
fringed
with
the
faintest
crimson
conquered
the
slowly
paling
glow
of
sunset
softly
the
western
light
expired
and
yet
came
there
no
stars
forth
the
cliffs
and
the
vales
and
waters
the
woodland
of
swaying
hemlocks
the
streamlets
trickling
down
on
the
came
there
no
moon
forth
rose
in
distance
a
dim
and
fearful
spectre
rose
accompanied
by
the
forest
singing
an
omen
of
evil
certainty
bringing
of
the
divine
wroth
far
from
northern
forests
descends
some
army
far
in
the
heavens
their
fires
are
reflected
waver
the
lights
in
an
archway
collected
sign
of
divine
wroth
shines
the
arch
in
a
wavy
brilliance
lighting
earth
from
its
quivering
span
of
silver
shines
the
aurora
soft
lake
and
river
shines
from
the
far
north
the
will
o
the
wisp
over
the
moorland
over
the
moor
sibilant
sounds
the
sneer
sneeringly
sounds
yet
with
a
lure
like
the
lure
of
the
mermaids
of
the
mere
calling
the
fishermen
into
their
snare
through
watery
veils
my
dim
eyes
peer
where
can
a
light
or
a
path
be
where
lost
on
the
moor
the
moorland
drear
lost
and
the
out
of
his
lair
raging
rampant
with
mighty
roar
and
the
glistening
lightning
flashes
its
glare
and
the
torrents
descend
with
a
pour
only
the
lightning
to
show
by
its
fire
the
tears
of
heaven
flooding
earth
floor
and
above
the
sound
of
the
ire
shriek
the
over
the
tor
shriek
in
a
quavering
tuneless
choir
what
that
in
the
distance
shining
afar
see
it
flickering
higher
and
higher
light
in
a
broadening
lengthening
bar
who
is
abroad
at
this
lonely
hour
or
is
it
a
cottage
high
on
the
scar
or
does
it
shine
in
my
lady
tower
to
guide
her
lord
from
lands
afar
nearer
and
nearer
i
haste
oh
for
power
to
reach
that
light
oh
to
be
sure
my
lady
would
welcome
me
in
her
bower
i
fall
i
sink
it
was
the
marsh
lure
when
on
the
shore
grates
my
barge
keel
weariness
weariness
unending
weariness
cease
break
thou
the
heart
thou
canst
not
heal
bitterness
bitterness
undying
bitterness
peace
on
shore
bring
to
rest
my
barge
keel
on
that
shadowy
shore
we
seek
at
life
release
for
thy
soul
belovèd
bears
death
seal
restlessness
restlessness
wandering
restlessness
haunts
me
lacking
thy
smile
all
life
brooklets
congeal
into
one
image
emotional
fearful
which
daunts
me
life
frozen
image
without
an
ideal
ceaselessly
ceaselessly
ceaselessly
mocking
life
taunts
me
gone
all
my
former
purpose
and
zeal
thou
wert
the
pattern
that
ordered
my
hopes
my
existence
all
that
life
meant
to
me
thou
didst
reveal
and
now
thou
art
gone
all
my
nature
is
lacking
subsistence
oh
let
this
soul
from
the
body
steal
then
to
the
spectres
plutonian
silent
ethereal
will
my
sad
spirit
for
thine
appeal
wandering
onward
and
onward
through
realms
immaterial
till
at
thy
feet
shall
it
joyously
kneel
then
must
my
weariness
weariness
weariness
cease
mended
the
heart
life
could
not
heal
bitterness
bitterness
ended
all
bitterness
peace
when
on
the
shore
grates
my
barge
keel
to
shelley
shelley
thy
spirit
is
set
among
the
stars
exalted
from
the
earth
thy
soul
sprang
high
from
these
drab
pavements
to
the
sky
in
one
grand
ecstasy
frail
mortal
bars
gave
thy
soul
purged
pure
of
earthly
scars
no
more
to
languish
here
with
lingering
sigh
rose
from
the
foaming
gulf
where
thou
didst
lie
rose
from
the
ragged
sail
and
splintered
spars
rose
to
elysium
fairest
bowers
serene
there
thine
ideal
is
ever
at
thy
side
and
soft
apollo
hand
doth
strike
the
strings
and
philomel
behind
a
bowery
screen
pours
forth
anacreon
blessings
on
thy
bride
who
to
thine
ear
unceasing
rapture
sings
thomas
de
quincey
through
life
he
strove
to
reach
his
goal
living
secluded
in
a
forest
dell
it
was
his
wish
to
learn
himself
so
well
as
to
command
the
secrets
of
the
soul
he
studied
wrote
and
fashioned
out
life
scroll
until
the
spirit
instincts
could
he
spell
and
then
at
last
diapason
swell
burst
forth
his
writings
the
world
to
roll
as
organ
music
sighs
through
cloistered
aisle
as
mighty
calms
upon
the
waters
steal
as
raging
shrieking
assail
so
doth
his
magic
word
our
minds
beguile
until
swept
onward
by
each
peal
on
peal
our
souls
are
lured
beyond
this
mortal
veil
the
vision
of
dante
upon
my
breast
there
weighed
ten
thousand
waves
of
black
unthinkable
despair
i
floated
in
atmosphere
of
leaden
density
in
atmosphere
that
burned
with
heat
yet
glowed
not
then
scintillating
stars
with
vivid
flashes
like
sparks
from
steel
struck
in
a
mine
thick
blackness
tortured
my
eyes
with
dazzling
glare
and
then
arose
a
rumbling
as
of
crashing
tombs
when
the
dead
waken
gone
my
will
my
power
i
could
nor
feel
nor
move
nor
cry
creation
seemed
rending
downward
through
eternal
space
the
thundering
ceased
there
shot
a
wail
of
pain
a
wail
more
anguished
than
arose
from
troy
when
hector
fell
fainter
it
grew
receding
through
the
spheres
the
meteors
flashed
no
more
i
floated
upward
on
invisible
wings
the
distance
purpled
in
the
glow
of
dawn
funereal
clouds
melted
to
shimmering
gray
and
far
away
the
notes
of
music
sounded
echoing
onward
to
infinity
music
celestial
of
that
choir
of
heaven
which
sings
unendingly
about
his
throne
distant
it
floated
yet
how
pure
and
clearer
than
clear
rebounding
alpine
notes
a
present
foretaste
of
the
sublime
beatitudes
and
my
visual
sky
moved
forms
of
beings
dark
forms
in
solemn
flight
toward
that
rich
purple
glow
the
vision
changed
so
pure
the
light
that
darkness
sealed
my
eyelids
so
grand
the
symphony
i
could
not
hear
the
whole
of
heaven
rang
in
awful
majesty
of
perfect
tone
and
my
mortal
vision
in
endless
tide
flowing
and
flowing
upward
toward
the
light
angels
innumerable
winged
on
majestic
to
the
music
time
winged
on
and
sang
a
ceaseless
hallelujah
the
spirit
of
schopenhauer
rush
on
rush
on
humanity
and
fill
your
hours
with
pain
rush
on
rush
on
upon
your
prizeless
race
where
is
your
gain
in
luxury
or
seas
of
swimming
gold
or
starry
ether
chained
to
conquerdom
you
do
but
add
new
wheels
new
chains
to
machine
to
govern
man
you
build
a
tower
more
high
than
babel
hoping
for
earthly
heaven
upon
this
structure
formed
of
luxuries
and
squander
here
celestial
bliss
which
your
poor
wills
would
mortgage
before
gained
your
little
lives
were
never
made
for
racks
and
fettered
strainings
of
this
world
that
quivers
your
nerves
with
death
marks
your
race
upon
his
and
madness
moves
upon
your
city
streets
your
fevered
minds
reel
downward
to
the
gulf
where
knowledge
fails
and
luxuries
lose
charm
where
passion
flickers
out
and
haste
seems
slow
rush
on
rush
on
destruction
marks
your
goal
rush
on
rush
on
till
death
has
breathless
felled
the
last
of
all
your
human
progeny
and
leaves
him
lying
there
alone
alone
like
him
who
first
had
shape
of
man
unburied
lost
in
a
race
with
no
competitor
and
nothing
as
the
goal
unburied
staring
at
the
passing
clouds
his
only
and
then
the
great
intelligence
if
such
there
be
will
see
his
moment
pastime
and
turn
his
arts
to
other
constellations
until
in
rolling
æons
his
mind
may
lose
the
memory
of
man
which
rush
on
rush
on
humanity
and
fill
your
hours
with
pain
rush
on
rush
on
death
is
your
hope
your
pilot
and
your
goal
and
nothingness
your
only
consolation
arthur
to
guenever
o
guenever
o
guenever
once
mine
god
may
assoil
thy
failing
but
can
i
whose
quivering
soul
is
blasted
and
whose
sky
is
in
agony
ah
thine
thine
might
have
been
the
fire
that
should
refine
my
table
round
to
silver
chastity
lofty
ensample
to
mine
hall
oh
why
should
thy
soft
light
no
longer
purely
shine
for
my
parched
soul
to
bathe
in
guenever
my
guenever
yet
thou
wert
only
mortal
so
too
am
i
and
shall
thy
every
tear
of
anguish
well
and
i
not
mark
o
hear
and
help
me
god
to
open
wide
the
portal
of
pardon
in
my
heart
for
guenever
the
death
of
thomas
chatterton
a
gutted
wick
still
flutteringly
aflame
upon
a
roughened
bench
bare
walls
bare
floor
and
glimmering
gray
of
sunrise
yes
and
more
ah
brother
for
i
call
thee
by
that
name
mine
eyes
to
thy
figure
came
thy
figure
fallen
like
a
flower
when
hoar
frosts
blight
thy
soul
wont
like
the
lark
to
soar
the
dawn
now
takes
a
loftier
aim
thy
funeral
chant
the
wind
thy
churchèd
tomb
the
pillared
vault
of
morn
thy
requiem
the
birds
thus
art
thou
dead
pale
spectred
want
thy
tribute
from
thy
kind
but
god
himself
thy
dirges
shall
adorn
with
sighing
psalms
of
every
wind
that
sped
a
spring
song
the
air
is
vibrant
with
a
sensuous
charm
the
grasses
nod
and
drowse
beneath
the
sun
dim
swelling
tones
upon
the
breezes
run
in
soft
security
from
dread
alarm
the
doves
are
cooing
and
the
wind
with
warm
caress
bears
the
arbutus
missive
one
line
of
scented
rapture
none
subtler
to
woo
the
swarm
let
me
sigh
out
my
soul
in
ecstasy
and
breathe
forth
all
the
fragrance
of
my
being
upon
the
summer
air
let
me
no
longer
merely
scent
hear
see
but
with
nature
in
that
law
agreeing
that
law
that
tincts
the
beauty
there
after
the
night
wove
her
web
across
the
sun
that
died
in
crimson
colors
gloom
hung
and
like
some
rich
perfume
formed
the
soft
essence
of
each
wind
that
sighed
out
of
my
casement
through
the
dark
i
spied
the
moon
afloat
in
tide
of
golden
spume
like
some
fair
flower
opening
into
bloom
the
earth
lay
dim
the
heavens
and
breezes
softer
than
a
maiden
breath
hushed
all
the
air
o
night
how
sweet
thy
charm
yet
not
thy
moon
nor
stars
nor
wind
each
one
of
these
shall
pass
when
we
are
changed
by
death
but
rather
sleep
thou
more
warm
yet
not
so
sweet
as
sweet
oblivion
what
wouldst
thou
be
what
wouldst
thou
be
a
cloud
upon
the
air
of
summer
skies
afloat
in
sunlit
charm
and
drinking
azure
bliss
all
free
from
care
and
nestling
near
the
sun
breast
rich
and

what
wouldst
thou
be
a
comet
trailing
eyes
of
thousand
terrors
through
the
throbbing
night
and
filling
earth
with
fear
and
vague
surprise
to
gaze
upon
thy
bright
liquescent
light
what
wouldst
thou
be
a
sullen
stalwart
cliff
immovable
upon
a
grassy
plain
kissed
by
no
clouds
and
cold
and
stark
and
stiff
unmelted
by
the
gentle
tears
of
rain
i
ask
nor
to
be

make
me
a
thought
incarnate
in
some
song
the
prophecy
of
david

overthrown
at

my

thou

some
fool
whose

was
such
poor

the

sipped

close
on
the
thirst
of
jealousy
that

me
on
my

of
torment

this
cup

thy

to

he
gasped
for
air
as
one
might
gasp
upon
a
mountain
height
revenge
and
hate
swept
through
the
lair
where
lurked
his
soul
shrinking
before
the
blast

into

aghast
did
all
this

world
leave
no
escape
from
evil

to

he
clapped
his

how
the

a

came
who
cringed
before
his
brow
whence
came
that
sighing
voice
let
no

go

the

by

my

gorge
its

he
smiled

approached
in
sore
strides
as
one

the

my

in

a
witch
dwelt
high
upon
stern
endor
cliff
the
place
was
dark
for
night
had
drawn
the
veiling
between
the
mountain
peaks
that
stand
still
stiff
the
frozen
sentinels
of
time
and
sailing
aloft
upon
the
evening
air
the
smoke
of
hostile
blackened
the
night
here
dwelt
this
hag
to
horrid
witchcraft
given
a
withered
fangless
thing
whose
mutterings
spoke
of
all
the
secrets
of
hell
the
wind
was
coldly
wailing
near
her
fire
she
crouched
behind
her
through
a
passage
riven
by
some
swift
thunderbolt
of
wrath
divine
appeared
a
man
in
closely
wrapped
attire
like
some
lithe
snake
she
turned
and
cringed
in
fear
and
yet
in
anger
by
what
sign
and
wherefore
come
you
here
her
lips
half
snarled
the
man
unwrapped
his
mantle
deeply
fringed
he
threw
a
purse
before
her
for
this
cost
let
thine
unseen
familiar
call
from
rest
the
one
i
name
to
thee
she
rose
all
gnarled
and
thus
she
spake
seek
not
to
hide
thy
mien
my
spirit
tells
me
that
thou
art
her
lean
hand
grasped
the
splintered
rock
thou
art
the
king
and
whom
wouldst
thou
my

seek
in
this
fane
of

serve
me
but
well
and
be
thou
wise
charm
as
i
bid
and
gratitude
shall
last
all
time
from
me
to
thee
fulfill
this
quest
he
paused
his
speech
and
glanced
to
either
side
summon
me
samuel
let
his
spirit
rise
upon
the
night
in
wreathèd
hazy
guise
the
faded
red
and
died
king
saul
sat
staring
into
sable
space
the
witch
was
mumbling
by
the
whence
curled
up
wisps
of
smoke
his
heart
beat
fast
within
the
gray
appeared
a
face
in
silent
terror
gazed
the
king
at
last
was
audible
a
voice
upon
the
wind
what
thou
saul
what
thou
learn
from
me
samuel
is
thou
and
then
as
in
a
gust
the
storm
sweeps
down
upon
the
plain
words
burst
in
passion
uncontrolled
and
fast
aid

the
star

the
spectre
voice
swept
on
upon
the
wind
the
spectre
faded
into
argent
gloom
down
shot
a
nacreous
moonbeam
the
king
eyes
fell
upon
the
armied
plain
there
rose
a
shout
again
and
yet
again
below
was
movement
battling
of
armed
men
and
shrieking
clash
of
arms
how
fiercely
shines
that
flaring
light
his
camp
was
sheathed
in
flame
in
flame
that
wrote
upon
his
soul
the
lines
once
fixed
the
star
of
forecast
can
not
wane
thine
all
has
been
in
vain
in
vain
in
vain
and
may
the
prophecy
of
saint
mark
a
metrical
pale
night
upon
its
swift
aërial
loom
wove
the
soft
vaporous
substance
of
the
gloom
the
gothic
porch
lay
dim
and
silent
in
drab
haze
with
which
the
spring
covers
its
carpentry
of
summer
bloom
a
maiden
stood
within
the
porch
pale
it
is
the
night
she
sighed
saint
marcus
night
when
ghosts
of
all
foredoomed
to
sickness
wing
into
the
church
to
pray
so
runs
the
tale
those
who
make
no
return
shall
feel
the
grim
fell
scythe
of
death
within
the
year
the
light
must
flicker
up
each
face
as
past
they
sail
but
gascon
o
my
gascon
shalt
thou
die
year
after
year
i
wait
thy
mail
surely
is
and
a
hovering
sigh
passed
through
her
lips
more
still
than
silence
frail
the
lowering
mist
grew
darker
from
the
womb
of
day
young
night
was
born
the
paling
light
was
flecked
with
flickering
in
the
gloom
and
to
and
fro
in
stately
pageantry
strange
like
spume
charmed
into
lightness
formed
an
imagery
of
things
still
the
maiden
pale
waited
and
hung
upon
each
shadowy
trail
of
lingering
vapors
fainting
to
and
fro
they
took
the
shape
of
flitting
forms
in
mail
or
monkish
cowl
a
spell
seemed
laid
upon
her
and
art
to
go
she
whispered
as
some
face
amid
the
rest
swept
by
her
through
that
portal
fell
and
some
not
marked
for
death
returned
again
and
some
returned
not
the
porch
rail
leant
her
light
body
as
she
scanned
each
form
and
tensely
looked
with
terror
why
does
she
shrink
with
pain
and
seek
to
gaze
again
a
blinding
storm
of
anguish
breaks
upon
her
o
what
doom
is
this
for
thee
and
me
why
doest
thou
glide
into
this
silent
tomb
pale
gascon
figure
fled
along
the
tide
some
forms
not
marked
for
death
returned
again
but
his
returned
not
ever
she
paused
and
waited
waited
in
the
gloom
at
last
the
flying
cloud
flakes
ceased
to
come
and
stilly
night
arose
my
god
to
whom
may
i
turn
now
my
richest
self
is
rent
down
from
the
carven
doorway
stumbling
slow
the
maiden
passed
silent
with
languishment
forth
from
the
darkness
stepped
a
man
all
dumb
she
gazed
in
careless
stupor
such
as
woe
stamps
on
the
soul
my
lady
may
i
dare
he
paused
and
gazed
bowed
sweepingly
and
low
then
spoke
again
she
stood
there
sad
and
fair
quivering
like
a
in
the
air
lady
a
traveler
asks
the
way
to
where
he
may
find
rest
and
lodgement
one
brief
while
she
stayed
herself
in
stupor
is
but
meet
a
soul
come
slowly
from
behind
the
veil
come
come
she
said
upon
her
face
a
smile
of
sorrow
blent
with
some
strange
joyance
pale
they
passed
along
the
quaintly
cobbled
street
and
then
turned
through
a
lane
where
high
the
gloomy
oaks
and
hawthorne
hedges
greet
the
eye
on
either
hand
a
cottage
stood
with
banks
of
sleepy
flowers
at
its
feet
and
all
around
the
giant
hoary
wood
frowned
down
its
shadows
on
the
garden
bloom
frowned
down
a
fateful
harbinger
of
gloom
within
the
cottage
all
was
warmth
and
cheer
there
stayed
the
mother
waiting
the
return
of
her
sweet
child
they
entered
she
did
greet
both
with
an
smile
and
clear
unchanging
peace
and
kindliness
that
burn
before
a
pure
soul
shrine
whom
have
we
here
marie
some
houseless
stranger
gone
astray
he
doffed
his
feathered
cap
and
bowed
full
low
after
long
twilight
wanderings
in
despair
of
any
hermitage
for
night
not
far
from
here
i
prayed
your
daughter
guidance
ere
the
dark
should
leave
me
but
a
chance
faint
star
by
which
to
fare
beside
the
oaken
board
they
sat
and
ate
the
rustic
dishes
there
while
young
sir
guy
poured
forth
a
glittering
hoard
of
warriored
stories
gathered
far
away
how
one
brave
knight
pierced
twenty
paynim
through
and
how
another
fled
from
the
affray
to
be
enslaved
by
sarazain
corsair
the
maiden
hungered
for
each
word
how
frail
be
warriors
lives
upon
the
thought
she
knew
a
bitter
memory
of
forecast
gloom
oh
she
must
fly
oh
something
must
avail
to
give
her
refuge
from
this
festering
sting
she
tried
to
turn
her
mind
from
sorrow
trail
and
gave
her
thoughts
to
the
narrator
tale
now
he
was
speaking
of
a
lord
who
strove
to
win
his
lady
but
the
christian
war
called
him
to
battle
for
his
faith
he
clove
damascus
steel
and
clinking
casques
but
he
could
return
sir
guy
then
ceased
for
here
arose
a
warning
on
the
mother
brow
she
wished
no
bitter
recollections
fear
for
marie
plausance
was
her
only
care
soon
all
the
cottage
slept
the
garden
bloom
and
fatefully
the
forest
frowned
its
gloom
the
summer
blossomed
faded
and
then
died
and
still
as
if
enchanted
stayed
he
there
they
took
long
walks
lonely
hill
and
dale
and
went
across
the
fields
with
flowers
pied
at
times
their
voices
rang
upon
the
air
but
ever
when
they
came
upon
that
vale
where
in
its
flowery
charm
the
cottage
stood
their
talk
would
fail
within
the
vasty
wood
thus
bathed
their
souls
in
summer
sultry
tide
like
flashing
moths
upon
the
wind
that
ride
and
hectic
autumn
came
and
brought
its
charm
of
leafy
brilliance
heralding
its
death
beside
the
evening
blaze
full
many
a
tale
he
told
of
knights
in
chivalrous
career
but
never
raised
the
fluttering
alarm
of
the
maiden
mother
by
the
faintest
breath
of
the
warrior
lord
and
his
loved
one
dear
then
hoary
chilling
winter
shrouded
pale
came
and
passed
by
thus
wandered
on
the
year
the
spring
was
coldly
wrapped
in
sullen
haze
even
the
mounting
sun
seemed
scarce
as
warm
as
during
winter
slowly
passed
the
days
until
the
eve
of
blest
saint
marcus
came
among
the
forest
ways
sir
guy
did
bring
the
maiden
arm
in
arm
how
oft
the
times
that
they
had
done
the
same
i
lived
a
life
careless
and
debonair
and
know
nor
fettering
bonds
nor
fear
yet
would
i
leave
it
all
without
a
care
she
upward
glanced
and
then
glanced
down
as
pale
as
any
flowing
in
the
gloom
oh
what
is
that
she
cried
the
misty
veil
parted
and
showed
a
glimpse
of
wall
is
but
the
village
kirk
he
said
a
pall
of
haze
enwrapped
them
like
the
will
of
doom
she
stood
and
faced
him
quivering
as
a
sail
that
blows
uncertain
in
a
varying
wind
marie
marie
he
faltered
then
a
flare
of
passion
burnt
his
soul
out
in
his
eyes
downward
she
glances
seeming
unaware
but
in
her
heart
beneath
the
outward
guise
warring
emotions
make
her
spirit
quail
gascon
loved
image
into
vision
flies
and
yet
her
rising
love
she
can
not
quell
for
brave
sir
guy
and
then
as
when
the
flail
lashes
the
chaff
dim
mist
before
her
flies
into
the
church
in
gascon
image
pale
the
year
is
out
what
then
should
avail
marie
sir
guy
is
breathing
on
the
air
she
reads
the
rest
within
his
flaming
eyes
yes
yes
she
murmurs
o
despair
despair
i
have
no
hope
you
fell
into
the
snare
his
eyes
dilated
with
mad
light
he
cries
i
i
am
gascon
whose
memory
you
dare
to
flout
for
any
knight
who
stays
a
year
within
your
sight
i
am
undone
my
doom
is
set
these
fateful
forests
be
my
bier
your
lover
is
a
wreath
of
shadowy
air
go
search
him
in
the
western
tempest
lair
for
me
i
hasten
from
this
mortal
gloom
sound
mine
own
knell
and
say
mine
own
last
doom
she
shrinks
away
with
inward
tumult
pale
his
voice
is
still
she
hears
a
something
fall
with
anguish
in
her
eyes
she
turns
there
all
stretched
out
upon
the
ground
he
lies
a
well
of
ruby
richness
pulses
with
his
frail
departing
breath
in
spell
of
agony
she
stares
into
the
gloom
pale
figures
children
of
the
womb
in
through
the
church
doorway
seem
to
sail
spectral
they
vanish
in
their
destined
tomb
she
moves
she
starts
she
cries
as
one
to
whom
has
come
the
horrid
messenger
of
doom
is
that
figure
floating
in
the
gloom
shall
my
life
fail
is
this
its
funeral
knell
pale
night
upon
his
swift
aërial
loom
wove
the
soft
vaporous
substance
of
her
doom
and
october
the
æolian
harp
into
my
wildly
whispering
heart
his
song
the
warm
sirocco
sings
whirring
whirring
and
all
the
artifice
of
mine
art
comes
on
the
wind
by
the
wind
to
part
part
from
my
whirring
strings
sometimes
i
sing
a
wild
weird
tale
that
like
a
wandering
phantom
wings
whirring
whirring
and
sometimes
only
a
lonely
wail
wells
as
an
echo
all
wildly
frail
frail
as
my
whirring
sings
my
notes
are
like
the
that
lightly
wave
before
whirring
whirring
each
whispering
ever
responds
slave
of
the
breeze
in
his
servile
bonds
slave
of
the
whirring
wind
soft
the
sirocco
sighs
his
tune
and
a
waning
funeral
chant
it
wings
whirring
whirring
the
song
shall
die
as
joys
die
soon
whelming
its
melody
into
a
swoon
swoon
of
the
whirring
strings
the
maid
that
i
wooed
an
ode
in
miniature
i
lie
upon
my
couch
by
night
and
dream
and
dream
until
the
quavering
her
portraiture
doth
seem
until
the
breeze
moaning
saith
in
stream
the
same
denial
she
answereth
i
lie
upon
my
couch
by
night
and
yearn
and
yearn
until
the
flickering
breeze
flight
bring
kisses
that
would
burn
until
my
soul
could
moan
with
pain
oh
wherefore
should
she
spurn
my
love
again
and
yet
again
i
toss
upon
my
couch
by
night
i
yearn
i
yearn
until
i
see
the
glimmering
light
upon
the
east
return
until
with
breath
i
pray
my
lady
stern
oh
let
me
win
thee
sweetest
death
in
a
minor
chord
an
ode
in
miniature
i
gave
my
soul
to
dreams
i
bathed
in
balm
i
sailed
through
boundless
ether
and
breathed
the
luscious
calm
tense
were
my
tuned
and
madly
quavering
as
i
sighed
their
music
sadly
waxed
and
wailed
then
swooned
and
floated
feebly
down
in
ebbing
tide
i
gave
my
soul
to
battle
i
defied
all
the
unlovable
in
life
i
could
have
bartered
heavenly
bliss
and
died
willingly
in
the
strife
to
elevate
mankind
mine
inward
power
i
strove
to
guide
i
harnessed
the
puissance
of
the
mind
and
toward
that
end
all
be
magnified
i
gave
my
soul
to
dreams
till
sated
pleasure
sank
to
pain
i
gave
my
soul
to
battle
i
defied
the
sordid
but
in
vain
still
still
my
spirit
wept
its
goal
was
hopeless
deified
oh
would
this
saddened
soul
had
ever
slept
unborn
for
slumber
is
a
painless
guide
a
glass
of
absinthe
an
ode
in
miniature
it
lay
within
a
glass
of
green
a
sinuous
glass
of
subtle
green
it
sparkled
with
a
slimy
sheen
a
languorous
fascination
gleamed
with
glint
of
lapis
lazuli
and
from
its
silken
surface
streamed
the
scent
of
musk
from
araby
ah
was
that
music
only
dreamed
that
tinct
the
drowsy
scene
and
was
my
fancy
false
or
seemed
the
glass
to
lure
me
with
its
limpid
green
my
fingers
fluttered
to
the
stem
to
kiss
the
fluted
serpent
stem
as
pious
persians
kiss
the
hem
enwove
with
many
a
wanton
trick
of
persia
deified
sofi
i
could
not
see
the
light
seemed
thick
as
perfume
from
the
or
incense
in
a
basalic
when
sounds
a
requiem
i
drank
the
draught
my
sense
was
sick
my
quivering
fingers
crushed
the
curling
stem
i
dropped
the
cup
of
i
scattered
fragments
false
emeralds
with
a
glassy
sheen
upon
the
pavement
how
they
gleamed
i
flung
the
bits
of
upon
the
table
i
swept
them
with
my
garment
hem
some
say
i
laughed
that
night
i
dreamed
of
araby
a
scene
of
sleepy
charm
whence
fragrance
streamed
and
in
mirage
the
desert
blossomed
green
the
palace
of
pain
a
cycle
i
a
soul
was
once
incarnate
in
a
man
and
this
unseen
incarnate
thing
was
mine
and
as
my
body
grew
the
soul
began
to
sip
more
fondly
of
the
scented
wine
and
sugared
blisses
life
can
give
at
call
it
languished
amid
luxuries
divine
showering
richly
like
the
leaves
that
fall
upon
the
autumn
air
pale
fleeting
pleasure
took
my
thoughtless
all
for
love
unselfish
rare
vibrated
through
the
discords
of
dull
time
blending
them
into
harmony
for
where
life
jangled
harsh
a
mother
care
would
chime
more
blissful
chords
than
can
be
told
in
rime
ii
the
gentle
harmonies
of
love
declined
and
swooned
into
a
dull
funereal
moan
and
faintly
floated
onward
with
the
wind
the
symphony
was
gone
i
stayed
alone
in
opiate
sadness
bound
i
did
not
scream
i
did
not
weep
nor
groan
my
soul
was
locked
in
stupor
whence
it
found
only
barred
gates
across
dim
vaults
and
jangling
discordant
chaos
stung
me
like
a
wound
i
could
not
think
i
could
not
hope
the
wrangling
of
jarring
sounds
oppressed
me
till
my
brain
was
lost
within
a
labyrinth
but
this
i
learned
although
my
powers
did
wane
that
love
through
death
transmutes
itself
to
pain
iii
i
sank
my
soul
upon
a
sea
of
dreams
i
floated
through
aërial
heights
divine
where
saffron
clouds
with
amber
beams
shimmering
strangely
stretched
in
shining
line
i
winged
my
way
to
heaven
very
dome
and
on
hell
portal
read
the
horrid
sign
i
danced
upon
the
wavelet
crested
foam
and
swept
tempestuous
on
the
stormy
wind
on
earth
like
some
vague
terror
did
i
roam
while
moaning
misery
pursued
behind
i
sang
my
song
had
one
refrain
with
anxious
care
and
artifice
refined
until
my
soul
accompaniment
would
wane
and
wax
to
one
unending
pain
iv
i
broke
my
of
dreams
i
climbed
the
winding
stair
to
palace
halls
where
all
the
air
was
soothed
by
and
every
sight
within
those
magic
walls
was
bright
with
radiant
opalescent
sheen
while
lulling
on
the
ear
light
music
falls
of
such
a
melody
as
has
been
unless
by
fays
on
fairy
lyres
played
there
pleasure
gowned
in
iridescent
green
reclines
upon
her
couch
with
gems
inlaid
and
gently
beckons
with
a
sinuous
arm
but
all
the
sumptuous
excesses
fade
the
walls
seem
dim
the
music
has
no
charm
for
pleasure
palace
is
a
place
of
harm
v
i
plunged
through
rooms
of
deepest
tyrian
dye
i
tore
the
veils
from
mysteries
aside
but
grinning
pleasure
ever
met
mine
eye
in
anguished
ecstasy
of
bliss
i
cried
and
through
the
halls
i
heard
the
echo
wane
until
the
last
most
distant
answer
sighed
the
spirit
of
the
world
is
pain
pain
pain
then
from
the
drowsy
distance
there
did
well
a
voice
as
of
a
witch
before
her
fane
some
spell
the
world
is
all
in
vain
the
merest
tool
of
accident
an
anteroom
to
hell
a
counterfeit
but
fairly
glinting
pool
snatch
all
the
joy
thou
canst
thou
human
fool
vi
and
then
i
searched
within
myself
to
find
the
and
of
all
i
heard
and
saw
i
found
but
silent
nothing
wearied
blind
i
strove
to
learn
the
omnipresent
law
on
whose
foundation
all
these
chambers
lean
i
found
within
the
artifice
no
flaw
and
not
the
slightest
secret
could
i
glean
i
searched
the
winding
labyrinthine
halls
and
scanned
colossal
colonnades
between
whose
rows
unending
space
is
seen
that
palls
the
straining
sight
yet
thither
lures
the
eye
with
fairy
sheen
through
all
the
outer
walls
no
doorway
pierced
to
water
earth
or
sky
is
there
an
answer
to
the
and
vii
and
yet
i
am
condemned
to
live
to
be
what
horrid
fate
decreed
it
life
is
blind
and
can
not
see
the
truth
oh
but
for
me
to
know
to
solve
this
riddle
of
the
mind
and
yet
no
whisper
through
the
age
gloom
has
taught
the
latent
answer
that
i
pined
and
finally
in
a
room
i
sank
in
languor
on
the
marble
floor
and
faintly
wondered
at
my
destined
doom
upon
my
weary
spirit
came
once
more
a
faint
remembrance
of
a
former
time
a
faint
remembrance
i
had
known
before
that
clung
about
me
like
an
ancient
rime
death
is
to
the
soul
but
a
change
of
clime
viii
then
from
the
body
tear
this
soul
away
let
me
seek
death
i
force
the
hand
of
fate
i
will
not
suffer
more
the
game
i
play
is
held
against
creation
and
the
weight
of
all
the
ages
hangs
with
fate
serene
stands
death
in
sable
gossamer
bedight
and
with
maternal
arms
would
intervene
and
seeks
to
press
me
silent
to
her
breast
quick
let
me
free
my
soul
from
pain
the
scene
is
fair
oh
let
this
weariness
be
blest
but
hold
i
still
may
keep
this
bitter
strain
of
torment
in
rest
death
summons
up
the
things
of
life
again
and
pain
of
life
transmutes
all
death
to
pain
ix
oh
but
to
float
away
upon
the
night
to
lose
my
soul
upon
her
silent
dark
to
feel
myself
a
nothing
a
frail
light
aërial
emptiness
a
fleeing
spark
of
sunshine
seeking
on
the
endless
void
some
rest
some
painless
silence
as
its
mark
like
an
asteroid
so
would
i
that
my
soul
should
haste
away
from
all
the
ordinary
earthly
cloyed
from
all
the
tawdriness
of
living
day
but
still
i
know
i
can
not
cease
to
be
though
i
condemn
my
body
back
to
clay
o
thrice
accursèd
immortality
that
dooms
me
life
through
all
eternity
x
o
maddening
horror
in
a
smiling
guise
alive
or
dead
i
am
a
slave
to
life
the
later
torment
with
the
former
vies
to
wring
my
soul
with
strife
i
have
a
debt
the
creditor
is
time
my
bond
my
bond
he
cries
and
holds
the
knife
to
wound
yet
never
kill
but
what
my
crime
i
fled
those
halls
where
vile
blisses
soothed
to
pain
a
clime
more
active
came
within
my
ken
the
dial
of
hours
hurried
round
the
rich
new
wine
of
busy
life
i
found
a
steady
file
swept
past
of
mortal
things
with
souls
like
mine
yet
what
the
purpose
of
their
streaming
line
xi
with
nervous
yearning
haste
they
on
their
way
a
few
direct
and
rule
the
work
of
all
but
most
are
bringing
mortar
stone
and
clay
and
some
there
are
that
rise
and
others
fall
and
they
are
seen
no
more
we
know
not
why
but
all
are
working
on
the
palace
wall
and
some
invent
designs
to
please
the
eye
and
some
would
fain
extend
the
rooms
to
win
blisses
a
cry
is
vibrant
in
the
air
and
thin
it
quavers
dimly
then
descends
again
and
echoes
aimless
through
the
busy
din
mankind
would
add
to
pleasure
but
in
vain
for
pleasure
palace
is
a
house
of
pain
xii
they
strive
they
strive
heap
luxury
on
bliss
and
worship
pleasure
as
their
ah
take
who
will
the
subtle
harlot
kiss
yes
seize
thy
moment
sweetness
then
i
ween
a
pageantry
of
pain
such
throbbing
throes
as
rive
the
soul
and
cut
the
quick
with
keen
imprisoned
edges
till
the
flows
man
little
knows
it
but
two
aims
has
he
by
present
anguish
store
up
future
woes
by
present
anguish
pain
posterity
the
quest
for
pleasure
is
a
quest
in
vain
pleasure
is
nothing
in
eternity
men
rather
act
than
think
for
thought
is
pain
and
action
is
the
opiate
of
the
brain
xiii
shall
i
play
roman
face
and
fight
these
ills
pretend
that
i
fight
and
still
may
win
a
child
his
dozen
mimic
soldiers
drills
and
six
with
six
the
battle
they
begin
some
victors
and
some
vanquished
some
he
slays
but
then
the
soldiers
are
mere
toys
of
tin
and
carelessly
upon
the
ground
he
lays
vanquished
and
victors
on
one
common
plane
and
takes
some
other
toy
and
laughs
and
plays
yes
like
that
soldier
may
i
fight
and
gain
great
victories
oh
i
may
stare
my
fate
between
the
eyes
and
drink
whole
draughts
of
pain
with
may
struggle
and
may
hate
but
where
the
payment
that
i
vainly
wait
xiv
i
dare
not
ponder
on
humanity
myself
i
dare
not
ponder
nor
my
goal
oh
would
that
i
were
lost
upon
that
sea
into
whose
silence
lethe
currents
roll
upon
its
bosom
would
that
i
pressed
mine
then
might
some
kindly
power
transform
this
soul
into
forgetfulness
or
would
some
wine
were
brewed
with
musk
or
attar
of
the
rose
and
colored
with
a
tint
incarnadine
and
so
compounded
that
a
dreamless
doze
would
come
from
one
red
draught
or
would
that
some
unmoving
glacier
froze
my
soul
within
its
crystal
no
craft
can
save
me
from
this
cup
of
pain
unquaffed
xv
oh
every
soul
is
only
pain
embalmed
and
every
torment
is
but
bliss
sting
humanity
lies
gasping
and
becalmed
upon
a
torrid
ocean
and
no
wing
of
albatross
is
seen
nor
was
seen
our
worldly
hope
is
dead
yet
rules
as
king
dust
ashes
ashes
dust
upon
these
lean
all
of
the
upward
struggle
of
mankind
and
pain
unending
pain
is
all
they
glean
goddess
of
pain
o
mistress
of
the
mind
art
thou
the
soul
of
life
or
hast
thou
palmed
thyself
on
men
once
happy
have
we
pined
forever
can
our
spirits
be
calmed
or
the
spirit
only
pain
embalmed
xvi
but
what
of
art
can
art
no
solace
hold
no
soothing
spikenard
soporose
drug
or

to
woo
the
wounded
soul
must
men
grow
old
in
agony
or
has
some

slipped
down
upon
us
cool
compassionate
but
what
of
art
can
art
frail
power
refine
our
souls
into
that
oversoul
and
mate
the
each
with
all
in
one
sublime

art
is
the
vision
of
that
truth
innate
in
man
a
soul
prismatic
crystalline
may
show
each
glow
of
being
with
each
strife
at
once
reflected

becalmed
and
twine
then
into
some
new
inward
world
all
rife
with
spirit
blisses
of

xvii
eternal
art
can
triumph
over
pain
and
once
we
breathe
the
deep
the
world
may
scream
with
iron
tongue
in

for
all
the
argosy

soothed
to

the
ships
may
rot
forever
on
the

far
off

may
wait

faintly
weep
more
rare
than

samarkand
more

more
fair
than

beauty
the

the
beauty

xviii
but
still
i
live
within
this
place
of
pain
and
still
i
seek
for
an
eternal
aim
for
after
death
mere
beauty
is
in
vain
what
is
there
deeper
flowing
from
this
same
unceasing
spring
quick
let
me
tear
the
veil
there
sat
a
statue
on
an
ebon
frame
a
statue
in
that
house
of
pain
so
pale
the
brow
and
still
the
nostrils
death
it
seemed
but
in
the
face
i
read
that
holy
tale
that
lay
on
the
madonna
face
where
gleamed
the
heavenly
light
from
the
young
christ
aureole
through
all
the
halls
of
pain
the
brilliance
beamed
and
every
discord
out
of
chaos
stole
to
swell
the
throbbing
organ
thunderous
roll
xix
faith
is
the
of
the
mind
all
else
is
vanity
the
preacher
saith
and
worldly
knowledge
painful
is
and
blind
oh
be
thyself
and
trust
thyself
the
breath
of
god
is
breathed
on
thee
believe
and
will
and
all
that
thou
wouldst
have
in
life
in
death
is
thine
i
heard
a
rustling
like
a
rill
upon
its
leafy
bed
just
such
a
sound
as
tincts
the
shadow
of
a
song
with
skill
more
intricate
than
arabesques
and
bound
with
tender
melodies
but
whence
the
choir
sang
i
never
found
mayhap
at
last
myself
may
learn
the
ties
wherewith
are
bound
those
lingering
harmonies
xx
and
when
the
soul
has
torn
the
fleshly
veil
and
moves
majestic
to
that
monotone
when
upon
the
air
i
sail
whither
the
wingèd
skylark
faith
has
flown
and
borne
me
fainting
upward
then
my
soul
may
seek
the
god
of
art
which
silent
lone
broods
on
a
sea
the
goal
of
all
humanity
incarnate
pain
is
calmed
to
everlasting
peace
there
roll
no
waves
upon
the
sea
charmed
has
it
lain
through
incommensurate
time
charmed
will
it
lie
through
all
eternity
and
there
again
upon
my
soul
in
silence
wrapped
shall
sigh
most
beautiful
a
mother
lullaby
