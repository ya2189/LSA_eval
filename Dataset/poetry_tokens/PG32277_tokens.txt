excess
to
mankind
brings
remorse
with
all
its
bitter
stings
when
cares
oppress
us
in
this
life
at
times
we
drink
to
banish
strife
but
when
its
feeble
aid
is
we
are
more
wretched
then
before
oft
poverty
the
man
disgrace
and
shows
a
drunkard
in
his
face
suppose
he
is
a
man
of

health
not

health
but
sad
to

such
characters

at
such

times
disclose
what
makes
our
valued
friends
our
foes
and
many
an
injured
wife
declares
that
bacchus
cause
her
many
tears
the
husband
oft
to
harlots
stray
he
bears
a
sway
and
by
his
aid
the
thoughtless
youth
is
led
from
virtues
paths
and
truth
oh
gentle
youth
the
smile
is
given
only
to
beguile
their
conversation
so
impure
that
men
of
sense
them
endure
be
chaste
in
every
thought
i
pray
sweet
modesty
will
gain
the
day
bacchus
with
her
can
not
contend
she
is
to
every
youth
a
friend
oft
do
i
see
a
good

by

ruined
and
undone
a

he
must
acknowledge
oft
he

on
saturdays

a
few
miles
from
his
gaudy
home
to
this
ancient
pretty
city

oft
in
the
boxes
folks
call
green
the
tenant
with
his
wife
is
seen
his
spending
money
in
that
way

sense
and
learning
then
display
when
farmers
hurt
themselves

clear

riding
home
and
drunk
appear
driving
their
horses
at
a
rate
as
plain
foretell
they
staid
too
late
the
gig

much
provoke
some
neighbour
who
may
want
his
farm

care
the
village
to
alarm
informs
his
neighbours
he
pay
his
tithe
till
sold
both
corn
and
hay
and
to
his
landlord
slyly
state
that
soon
must
be
his
fate
his
neighbour
was
in
liquor
found
senseless
and
bleeding
on
the
ground
on
going
home
he
drove
so
fast
as
if
each
minute
was
his
last
broke
his
gig
and
spoilt
his
mare
this
sir
is
true
i
do
declare
what
i
now
state
to
others
name
and
they
will
tell
you
just
the
same
sir
cried
the
landlord
in
a
pat
he
knows
not
what
he
would
be
at
quickly
his
mind
i
will
alarm
for
i
will
turn
him
out
his
farm
to
me
tenant
but
at
will
soon
soon
be
on
i
instant
will
the
sot
distress
and
others
will
him
sharply
press
sir
cries
his
neighbour
should
that
be
i
hope
give
me
liberty
to
offer
you
a
great
deal
more
then
ere
you
let
his
farm
before
i
have
two
bondsmen
at
my
call
one
lives
you
know
at
such
a
hall
the
other
friend
is
banker
steady
they
both
to
serve
me
sir
are
ready
sir
cries
the
landlord

keep
sober
and
only

your
own
october
promise
what
of
me
and
you
my
tenant
soon
shall
be
send
the
bailiffs
on
his
place
and
that

bring
him
to
disgrace
the
slanderer
says
pray
sir
state
what
i
to
you
this
day
relate
no
says
the
landlord
not
say
what
you
have
told
me
on
this
day
this
slanderer
i
do
know
well
and
only
do
the
truth
now
tell
most
farmers
whose
estates
are
large
their
public
duty
well
discharge
they
live
on
such
a
handsome
plan
as
note
and
mark
them
gentlemen
i
do
protest
it
is
great
pity
some
drink
so
hard
when
in
this
city
as
when
rattling
the
stones
they
break
a
poor
old
bones
or
by
his
trotting
horse
down
before
he
leaves
a
market
town
i
do
but
state
what
many
view
and
norwich
surgeons
know
its
true
good
farmers
i
do
much
esteem
and
therefore
make
them
oft
my
theme
may
every
farmer
when
he
dine
have
means
to
drink
a
pint
of
wine
on
viewing
the
cattle
market
on
the
castle
hill
the
wealthy
farmer
with
a
rosy
hue
weekly
attends
the
hardy
scot
to
view
the
pretty
homebred
soon
his
eye
detain
views
and
admires
then
chat
in
lively
strain
of
natures
produce
till
his
business
call
him
from
such
pleasing
sights
to
pace
the
hall
soon
as
he
sees
his
merchant
at
his
stand
he
shows
the
produce
of
his
fertile
land
give
you
such
a
price
the
merchant
say
a
higher
bidder
not
find
this
day
but
ere
the
farmer
quits
the
hill
he
view
all
other
stock
to
find
out
something
new
a
thought
then
strikes
him
as
the
fine
buy
a
few
score
sheep
before
i
dine
into
the
pens
he
hies
the
bargain
struck
the
jobber
takes
his
cash
wish
him
good
luck
prehaps
his
steed
travel
to
his
mind
looks
at
the
nags
and
do
a
good
one
find
the
price
he
thinks
too
high
but
not
refrain
making
another
bid
the
horse
to
gain
the
dealer
tempted
by
the
offer
say
sir
comply
hurry
so
away
lets
take
a
glass
of
wine
to
wish
success
to
your
new
the
farmer
press
the
nag
is
taken
from
the
stand
with
glee
another
takes
his
place
with
broken
knee
the
buyer
says
what
have
you
standing
here
a
damaged
one
a
tumbling

i
fear

cries
the
dealer
as

for
plough
pretty
to
the
sight
no

must
be
in
a
joke

that
i
want

guineas
for
him

to
you

useful
one

the
farmer
cries
before
i

the
wealthy
farmer
draws
the
canvas
bag
now
to
the
tavern
blithsome
they
repair
take
wine
and
wish
that
liquor
so
dear
looks
at
his
watch
then
loud
the
buyer
cry
its
half
past
one
i
to
the
hall
must
hie
sell
as
much
corn
as
shall
be
in
my
power
much
afraid

markets
will
be
lower
sold
he
cried
my
wheat
and
barley
well
i
wish
i
could
my
oats
and
horse
beans
sell
straight
to
his
merchant
the
farmer
hop
fearful
next
market
day
all
things
will
drop
the
cautious
merchant
on
his
skill
rely
and
thinks
will
have
a
small
supply
contrary
winds
will
keep
the
vessels
back
and
in
his
purchase
he
will
not
be
slack
only
one
thought
now
harass
much
his
brain
he
fears
to
shop
to
go
again
least
he
should
meet
rebuke
and
irksome
scorn
on
casting
up
he
found
overdrawn
a
running
mortgage
please
the
mind
gains
it
and
to
the
merchant
is
more
kind
but
disappointment
all
his
efforts
blast
a
large
supply
is
in
at
last
is
full
and
markets
now
decline
a
large
supply
and
weather
very
fine
the
malsters
leaving
off
wet
no
more
and
only
clear
what
is
upon
the
floor
merchants
there
are
now
dwelling
in
this
place
that
often
routs
their
handsome
houses
grace
gigs
very
fine
a
livery
servant
too
is
always
kept
to
hide
known
by
few
that
his
expences
far
exceeds
his
gain
and
that
the
banker
mortgages
retain
on
each
estate
the
gaudy
thing
has
bought
and
that
in
real
wealth
not
worth
a
groat
still
he
goes
on
till
on
a
sudden
stray
away
awhile
and
cant
the
farmer
pay
flies
to
his
factor
in
the
time
of
need
for
an
advance
but
do
not
there
succeed
some
characters
like
those
i
do
know
well
they
last
long
they
cut
so
great
a
swell
oft
do
we
see
a
very
handsome
coach
a
merchant
sport
and
meriting
reproach
because
full
well
he
knows
his
books
must
show
his
ranting
on
has
brought
him
very
low
when
the
case
too
often
others
find
a
gig
or
coach
is
kept
the
eye
to
blind
to
every
honest
man
i
wish
success
and
may
misfortune
never
on
them

the
lion

the

jackalls

ill

you

i

my
tale
of
woe
none
can
deny
you

your
master
dwells
on

he
soon
will
stop
your

he
wears
a

grand

is
more
merciful
than
you
your

him

us
here
we
should
the

revere
and
serve
them
if
we

this
will
a
warning
prove
to
other
lions
in

who
may
hereafter
stray
by

or
order
to

and
not
incur
the

disgrace
we
day
the
low
bred

seek

in

farewell
ye
partner
of
my
woes
farewell
the
finest
language
could
but
faintly
tell
what
i
now
feel
in
writing
this
adieu
what
you
must
suffer
when
far
from
you
there
was
a
time
when
happiness
my
lot
i
serenely
in
my
little
cot
no
wicked
thoughts
did
then
disturb
my
rest
my
children
round
me
by
a
father
prest
no
father
now
methinks
i
hear
them
say
gone
from
us
hurried
far
away
nightly
them
in
my
dreams
seen
their
wet
eyes
and
heard
their
dreadful
screams
methought
my
wife
came
to
my
lonely
cell
to
say
adieu
to
bid
a
long
farewell
soon
i
awoke
and
to
increase
my
pains
i
felt
my
legs
round
with
chains
then
then
i
cried
oh
drunkenness
thou
cause
of
this
distress
and
made
me
break
those
laws
that
wise
men
made
for
every
man
to
keep
by
them
deluded
in
crimes
so
deep
first
step
to
ruin
was
a
love
of
dice
with
cards
the
great
promoter
of
our
vice
i
wish
those
men
who
do
with
such
things
play
would
ever
cast
them
from
their
hands
away
i
wish
all
magistrates
would
search
around
and
punish
publicans
where
they
are
found
they
caused
me
first
my
master
to
neglect
and
after
lost
me
honest
respect
they
also
led
me
from
a
virtuous
wife
and
mostly
caused
me
sad
disgrace
and
strife
view
public
houses
every
wealthy
squire
and
force
by
ten
the
spendthrift
to
retire
by
such
a
plan
the
labouring
poor
would
rise
soon
as
the
sun
adorns
the
heavenly
skies
stated
what
have
brought
me
to
this
end
and
what
has
lost
me
every
earthly
friend
except
a
god
protect
and
bless
her
and
our
offspring
now
in
great
distress
young
men
be
cautious
how
ye
spend
your
time
a
bad
acquaintance
hurries
on
a
crime
sometimes
an
artful
female
tries
her
power
to
trap
the
giddy
in
a
thoughtless
hour
when
she
has
the
captive
to
her
will
she
gladly
sees
you
taking
pill
cause
you
to
leave
a
virtuous
homely
wife
and
lead
a
sad
disgraceful
wicked
life
by
art
bring
you
to
distress
and
like
a
millwood
to
you
falsely
press
then
be
the
first
your
actions
to
betray
a
fiend
like
such
caused
me
to
go
astray
from

i
love
from
those
my
heart
hold
dear
and
shall
till
death
their
memories
revere
when
i
am
in

doubtless
my
love
sometimes
sigh
for
me
bring
up
my
little
ones
in
such
a
way
as
they
will
holy
keep
the
early
in
life
do
in
their
minds
reveal
the
dreadful
crimes
to
swear
to

my
eldest

her
where
constant
under

and
care
let
her
not
learn
the
weaving
trade

that
such

may
injure
much
her

females
are

as
they
wish
fair
virtue
to
depart
unwilling
oft
in

for
to
be
where
they
dress
and
have
their
liberty
but
if
with
parents
they
can
work
at
home
nightly
they
hope
with
idle
folks
to
roam
at
my
late
sentence
i
can
not
complain
the
law
my
body
do
detain
justice
slow
has
overtaken
me
abroad
for
life
i
shall
be
kept
from
thee
on
a
just
god
for
ever
i
will
trust
i
know
his
will
is
always
right
and
just
tis
now
too
late
again
to
speak
to
you
which
is
the
cause
of
writing
this
adieu
no
partner
now
to
sooth
my
aching
heart

galls
me
at
myself
i
start
with
aching

and
in
my
lonely

i
bid
my
babes
and
long
farewell
methinks
i
see
the
transport
full
in

and
i
with
horror
meet
the
crew
full
well
i

i
shall
see
you

my

with
vile
wretches

a

pursue
far

still
leave
my

with
you
vile
man
abstain
from
every
artful
plan
when
found
out

the
name
of

let
those
who
steal
repent
and
sin
no
more
ere

on
them
pour
from

we
greater
ills
pursue

you

you
do
your
being
at
them
brings
a
stain
on
you
those

afterwards
repent
and
share
alike
in
point
of
punishment
the

present
there
take
my
advice
let
reason
bear
her
sway
from
scenes
of
discord
always
keep
away
think
it
hard
a
worthless
savage
crew
should
gain
by
plunder
all
your
goods
from
you
the
worst
of
men
are
foremost
on
a
plan
to
gain
by
rapine
every
way
they
can
do
you
suppose
that
wasting
others
store
can
ease
the
hardships
of
the
labouring
poor
no
such
a
course
our
present
ills
increase
and
robs
the
nation
of
its
inward
peace
from
late
example
all
are
taught
to
know
dreadful
his
fate
that
strikes
blow
then
let
us
quiet
at
our
cots
remain
and
better
times
will
cheer
us
once
again
all
means
are
trying
comforts
to
restore
to
ease
the
hardships
of
the
labouring
poor
think
what
distress
awaits
dishonest
ways
immured
in
prison
many
wretched
days
not
only
days
perhaps
they
shed
their
tears
in
foreign
lands
for
many
dismal
years
not
only
years
perhaps
are
for
life
abroad
to
roam
from
children
home
and
wife
should
it
your
lot
in
prison
for
to
be
implore
with
fervent
prayer
the
deity
who
will
in
time
if
you
sincerely
pray
lessen
your
troubles
each
succeeding
day
our
aid
that
we
should
crave
a
gracious
pardon
ere
we
meet
the
grave
his
intercession
with
the
king
of
kings
alone
can
save
you
from
eternal
stings
when
at
the
court
for
trial
you
appear
speak
nought
but
truth
you
better
for
it
fare
for
should
you
dare
to
introduce
a
lie
sharp
eye
each
falsehood
will
descry
known
a
witness
brought
to
swear
the
guilty
felon
of
his
crime
is
clear
he
feels
alas
too
late
such
impious
conduct
greatly
aggravate
besides
he
answers
at
the
awful
day
for
causing
others
from
the
truth
to
stray
whatever
happens
in
this
vale
of
tears
our
maker
knows
give
him
your
fervent
prayers
let
your
demeanor
if
in
prison
be
such
as
the
jailor
can
contrition
see
for
his
report
may
mitigate
your
doom
and
sometimes
save
you
from
a
gloom
religious
books
if
you
can
read
attend
they
are
in
solitude
the
friend
when
at
the
chapel
do
not
cast
away
by
inattention
what
the
chaplain
say
pure
religion
cheers
each
good
heart
and
will
in
time
its
blessings
soon
impart
such
as
perhaps
you
never
knew
before
and
doubtless
will
your
peace
of
mind
restore
the
bible
read
when
in
your
dismal
cell
read
it
attentive
ere
you
bid
farewell
to
him
who
may
companion
with
you
be
your
soul
that
night
may
be
required
of
thee
a
scene
i
witnessed
and
not
long
time
since
would
stop
the
errors
of
an
hardened
prince
three
men
were
by
the
law
to
die
to
hear
them
mourn
to
see
the
drooping
eye
would
cause
sensations
of
a
painful
kind
while
anxious
cares
oppress
the
mind
a
pious
chaplain
strove
to
bring
in
view
the
pardon
if
repentants
true
he
said
that
god
was
merciful
and
just
to
implore
forgiveness
on
his
word
to
trust
there
is
a
record
where
the
scripture
say
those
that
repent
he
will
not
cast
away
a
sigh
or
tear
can
not
that
boon
impart
it
must
be
fervent
from
the
head
and
heart
aid
vile
sinners
doth
he
save
if
true
repentants
ere
they
meet
the
grave
each
they
could
recal
the
time
past
and
they
would
live
as
if
each
day
the
last
just
before
death
they
me
to
implore
an
erring
mortal
to
transgress
no
more
hope
their
chaplain
might
for
ever
be
when
on
high
blessed
to
eternity
they
knew
his
worth
his
heart
is
of
a
kind
that
plants
soft
pity
to
a
feeling
mind
deeker
as
chaplain
few
can
excel
by
all
who
bid
the
jail
farewell
when
first
i
saw
these
wretched
men
in
jail
before
their
trial
did
their
fate
bewail
soon
as
the
sentence
met
each
anxious
ear
and
true
repentants
did
appear
one
and
all
cried
out
oh
that
god
how
just
to
stop
our
sad
career
on
thee
trust
one
cause
alone
have
made
this
sad
distress
neglecting
day
and
our
drunkenness
an
address
a
man
of
the
reflect
ere
death
call
you
away
to
answer
at
the
awful
day
your
thousands
can
not
purchase
life
but
as
you
waste
it
cause
you
strife
many
a
pang
felt
of
late
i
must
pronounce
you
vile
ingrate
by
art
you
gain
a
smile
soon
as
acquired
would
her
beguile
careless
the
pangs
a
husband
feel
to
you
i
make
this
sad
appeal
was
you
a
married
man
what
pain
was
a
faithless
friend
to
gain
your
affection
from
your
view
and
bid
each
moral
plan
adieu
this
truth
to
you
sure
is
known
then
scan
such
case
as
if
your
own
juries
are
often
kind
its
true
sure
they
have
been
so
to
you
there
is
a
judge
that

did
you
from
wicked

while
ranging
the
shady

doubtless
you
thought
of
nought
but
love
the
prying
eye
of
searching
man
in
its

of
this
age

fit

with
many
a

man
wealth
may
a

does
it

sharp
pains
endure
send
them
afar
to
foreign
land
let
each
be
branded
on
the
hand
scarce
a
crime
on
earth
more
vile
then
artless
women
to
beguile
the
wretch
guilty
of
that
sin
on
females
does
great
anguish
bring
levity
too
often
leads
astray
the
lovely
female
that
is
gay
a
love
of
dress
too
often
cause
women
to
break
the
marriage
laws
and
pity
i
do
declare
many
so
gaudy
should
appear
soon
as
distress
awaits
the
fair
madam
is
clad
in
deep
despair
her
sorrow
is
of
selfish
kind
not
gaining
things
quite
to
her
mind
her
mind
is
fixed
soon
to
impart
the
fondest
darling
of
her
heart
to
the
first
artful
man
she
see
a
strong
desire
for
liberty
this
from
her
home
without
delay
to
taste
the
pleasures
of
the
day
now
had
the
husband
taught
his
wife
economy
throughout
his
life
more
easy
have
kept
at
home
but
he
allowed
her
oft
to
roam
to
plays
and
balls
and
such
like
places
where
giddy
wantons
show
their
faces
actions
are
brought
large
damages
to
gain
which
must
give
every
thinking
bosom
pain
some
trifling
want
of
proper
evidence
may
give
a
british
jury
just
pretence
to
give
acquittal
then
the
parties
smile
to
think
how
much
the
public
they
beguile
still
keen
remorse
embitters
every
joy
the
parties
can
by
bribes
decoy
such
hirelings
as
their
influence
can
bind
and
clap
a
padlock
on
the
tongue
and
mind
serious
reflections
my
life
is
embittered
with
cares
the
reason
to
me
is
quite
plain
i
have
caused
many
sighs
and
sad
tears
to
her
i
shall
see
again
she
is
fled
from
my
presence
above
i
shortened
her
days
in
this
life
to
share
true
angelical
love
she
is
from
all
pain
care
and
stife
how
could
i
the
dictates
disdain
of
a
parent
so
kind
and
so
just
or
give
her
sweet
bosom
such
pain
she
is
happy
i
hope
and
i
trust
that
god
who
is
setting
on
high
have
planted
remorse
in
my
heart
its
pangs
i
shall
feel
till
i
die
may
i
then
from
my
troubles
depart

oft
she
cried
ere
too
late
to
her
precepts
i
did
not
attend
my
consience

me
ingrate
to
disdain
such
advice
from
a
friend
such
a
friend
i
shall
more
attain
to
me
she
was
always
sincere
i
hope
i
shall
meet
her
again
when
summoned
on
high
to
appear
may
repentance
atone
for
the
past
and
cleanse
me
from
every
stain
may
the
tears
of
sincerity
last
that
my
parent
i
do
meet
again
sometimes
i
revisit
the
spot
where
my
parent
was
used
for
to

cot
where
i

the
object
farewell
ere
death

releaved
her
from
pain

me
from
vice

abstain
and
in
future
more
pious
to

had
i
her
blessing
received
and

faintly

an
adieu

wounded
cried
aloud

they
knew
that
a
ball
pierced
his
heart
yet
it
our
distress
to
find
him
surrounded
by
those
friends
he
loved
when
to
depart
he
requested
to
know
the
fate
of
the
battle

likely
that
england

day
when

painful
sensation
for
the
loss
of

beloved
by
us
all
there
was
a
lady
better
her
station
yet
grim
death
with
his
mandate
alike
strikes
the
ball
neither
princes

kings
can
induce
him
to
tarry
away
from
the
object
to
strike
to
the
aged
or
young
to
the
giddy
or
merry
he
darts
out
his
arrows
and
wounds
them
alike
scarce
had
providence
made
our
princess
a
mother
when
god
thought
it
fit
to
call
her
above
to
taste
of
those
joys
rolling
time
can
not
smother
and
share
of
those
blessings
that
flows
from
his
love
to
protect
and
to
cherish
the
aged
and
helpless
her
purse
would
be
drawn
and
its
comforts
expend

any

always
her

will
be
felt
a
long
time
by
the

and
sincere
is
the
tear
that
is
shed
her
bier
her
donations
were
such
as
noted
the
sorrow
she
felt
for
the
poor
that
were

and
used
for
to

gladden
old
shore
the
of
an
affectionate
parent
my
pen
can
not
describe
or
tears
convey
the
pains
i
felt
when
late
i
bade
farewell
i
in
embrace
a
parent
lay
and
heard
the
passing
of
the
mournful
bell
nine
disease
its
ravages
had
made
death
her
from
all
sufferings
here
i
saw
the
sexton
with
his
iron
spade
mark
out
the
spot
and
place
the
gloomy
bier
affecting
scene
while
recollection
last
trace
the
parting
of
our
sad
adieu
dwell
on
those
scenes
that
are
for
ever
past
in
my
mind
it
troubles
fresh
renew
just
before
death
had
wield
the
fatel
blow
that
stops
the
power
of
utterance
or
sigh
she
with
a
voice
angelic
soft
and
low
cried
lord
forgive
me
my
spirit
fly
oft
have
i
seen
my
virtuous
parent
stray
her
garden
pensive
and
forlorn
to
cull
the
flowers
each
succeeding
day
and
view
the
beauties
of
a
morn
scarce
did
a
flower
adorn
the
spot
around
but
her
hand
planted
in
its
proper
place
no
fonder
lover
of
those
sweets
were
found
while
she
their
beauties
in
her
mind
could
trace
three
days
before
her
sufferings
were
she
craved
assistance
to
her
favourite
spot
and
said
my
roses
i
shall
see
no
more
and
when
absent
they
will
be
forgot
but
for
her
sake
a
faithful
servant
toil
to
free
the
flowers
from
weeds
from
morn
till
night
or
bring
fresh
water
to
the
thirsty
soil
to
that
spot
that
gave
her
oft
delight
anticipation
to
the
panting
heart
the
dread
decree
of
ordain
to
say
she
must
from
earthly
scenes
depart
and
not
to
them
for
ever
turn
again
meekness
life
had
marked
her
for
her
care
while
resignation
her
for
her
own
sometimes
her
mind
cheerful
still
appear
and
strive
to
stifle
afflicting
groan
oh
god
she
cried
thy
mercy
let
me
crave
till
short
span
is
taken
quite
away
then
may
i
rest
at
peace
within
the
grave
to
wait
thy
summons
for
the
awful
day
scarce
had
religion
brought
sweet
hope
to
aid
the
virtuous
victim
in
the
pangs
of
death
when
soft
a
guardian
angel
gently
said
dwell
with
me
when
time
extinguish
breath
a
few
short
struggles
and
the
scene
was
death
with
his
victim
flew
above
the
skies
i
shall
life
her
absence
oft
deplore
till
recollection
from
my
memory
flies
the
humble
cottagers
their
mistress
bore
to
her
cold
home
each
face
with
tears
she
to
her
mansion
to
return
no
more
for
death
has
all
her
hopes
and
fears
oh
had
you
seen
my
good
and
worthy
sire
in
garment
his
last
duty
pay
to
her
whose
virtues
did
esteem
acquire
or
ease
the
troubles
of
a
luckless
day
two
sorrowing
sons
the
gloomy
day
who
will
while
life
remain
her
loss
deplore
till
recollection
from
them
fade
away
or
erring
mortals
here
do
sin
no
more
each
little
mourner
tear
when
dust
on
dust
the
coffin
hid
from
view
their
youthful
sighs
denoted
their
despair
when
they
to
bid
a
long
adieu
to
read
your
letter
and
again
happy
to
find
you
faithful
do
remain
besides
forgiveness
though
too
much
i
fear
i
long
have
made
you
victim
to
despair
you
say
two
years
with
fervency
i
strove
to
keep
affection
constancy
and
love
but
soon
as
crosses
came
upon
my
mind
was
careless
of
you
and
unkind
i
know
my
home
was
neat
serene
and
nice
but
ah
that
home
i
lost
allured
by
vice
soon
as
you
fled
a
different
scene
in
view
gone
all
attention
soon
as
i
lost
you
the
quick
retort
was
always
in
my
ears
a
virtuous
wife
in
tears
soon
as
i
found
all
hopes
to
meet
you
fled
i
i
might
be
numbered
with
the
dead
aid
i
oft
invoked
by
drink
i
could
not
meditate
nor
dared
to
think
you
say
it
cost
you
tears
to
write
to
me
but
disperse
when
you
a
convert
see
long
a
pardon
from
above
to
make
me
worthy
of
the
wife
i
love
return
and
till
my
days
are
at
an
end
prove
protector
guardian
and
a
friend
the
converse
delicate
the
smile
sincere
will
check
the
sigh
and
stop
the
rising
tear
cheerful
as
formerly
pass
our
life
a
happy
husband
i
and
you
the
wife
on
the
death
of
lord
nelson
the
fleet
of
haughty
france
and
spain
no
more
will
triumph
on
the
