now
they
remain
to
us
forever
young
who
with
such
splendor
gave
their
youth
away
perpetual
spring
is
their
inheritance
though
they
have
lived
in
flanders
and
in
france
a
round
of
years
in
one
remembered
day
they
drained
life
goblet
as
a
joyous
draught
and
left
within
the
cup
no
bitter
lees
sweetly
they
answered
to
the
king
behest
and
gallantly
fared
forth
upon
a
quest
beset
by
foes
on
land
and
on
the
seas
so
in
the
ancient
world
hath
bloomed
again
the
rose
of
old
romance
red
as
of
yore
the
flower
of
high
emprise
hath
whitely
blown
above
the
graves
of
those
we
call
our
own
and
we
will
know
its
fragrance
evermore
now
if
their
deeds
were
written
with
the
stars
in
golden
letters
on
the
midnight
sky
they
would
not
care
they
were
so
young
and
dear
they
loved
the
best
the
things
that
were
most
near
and
gave
no
thought
to
glory
far
and
high
they
need
no
shafts
of
marble
pure
and
cold
no
painted
windows
radiantly
bright
across
our
hearts
their
names
are
carven
deep
in
waking
dreams
and
in
the
dreams
of
sleep
they
bring
us
still
ineffable
delight
methinks
heaven
gates
swing
open
very
wide
to
welcome
in
a
host
so
fair
and
strong
perchance
the
unharmed
angels
as
they
sing
may
envy
these
the
they
bring
and
sigh
they
take
up
the
triumph
song
the
shells
o
my
brave
heart
o
my
strong
heart
my
sweet
heart
and
gay
the
soul
of
me
went
with
you
the
hour
you
marched
away
for
surely
she
is
soulless
this
woman
white
and
still
who
works
with
shining
metal
to
make
the
things
that
kill
i
tremble
as
i
touch
them
so
strange
they
are
and
bright
each
one
will
be
a
comet
to
break
the
purple
night
grey
fear
will
ride
before
it
and
death
will
ride
behind
the
sound
of
it
will
deafen
the
light
of
it
will
blind
and
whom
it
meets
in
passing
but
god
alone
will
know
each
one
will
blaze
a
trail
in
blood
will
hew
a
road
of
woe
o
when
the
fear
is
on
me
my
heart
grows
faint
and
cold
i
dare
not
think
of
what
i
do
of
what
my
fingers
hold
then
sounds
a
voice
arise
and
make
the
weapons
of
the
lord
he
rides
upon
the
whirlwind
he
hath
need
of
shell
and
sword
his
army
is
a
mighty
host
the
lovely
and
the
strong
they
follow
him
to
battle
with
trumpet
and
with
song
o
my
brave
heart
my
strong
heart
my
sweet
heart
and
dear
is
not
for
me
to
falter
is
not
for
me
to
fear
across
the
utmost
barrier
wherever
you
may
be
with
joy
unspent
and
deathless
my
soul
will
follow
thee
the
watcher
little
white
moon
each
night
from
heaven
you
lean
to
watch
the
lonely
seas
and
all
the
earth
between
o
little
shining
moon
what
have
you
seen
what
have
you
seen
upon
the
fields
of
france
where
through
the
drowsy
grain
the
gay
red
poppies
dance
unheeding
splintered
gun
or
broken
lance
deep
in
the
and
still
what
is
it
you
have
found
by
and
by
rill
what
by
each
hollow
and
each
little
hill
when
the
sky
the
driven
flee
and
through
a
dusky
veil
look
down
fearfully
what
do
you
find
adrift
upon
the
sea
in
the
great
mountains
where
the
four
winds
blow
where
the
king
cavalry
and
his
go
what
have
you
seen
beneath
the
shifting
snow
little
white
moon
so
old
so
strangely
bright
how
could
you
still
shine
on
unless
you
knew
some
night
here
in
the
world
you
watch
all
would
be
right
october
goes
october
goes
and
its
colors
all
pass
at
dawn
there
a
silver
film
on
the
grass
and
the
reeds
are
shining
as
pipes
of
glass
but
yesterweek
where
the
cloud
waves
rolled
down
a
sky
that
was
grey
and
cold
sailed
the
hunter
moon
a
galleon
of
gold
and
now
in
the
very
depth
of
the
night
it
is
just
a
little
flame
blown
and
white
or
a
moth
on
a
weary
flight
but
the
steadfast
trees
at
the
forest
rim
and
the
pines
in
places
scented
and
dim
still
wait
for
one
hunter
and
watch
for
him
and
the
wind
in
the
branches
whispers
why
and
the
yellow
leaves
that
go
rustling
by
say
only
remember
and
sigh
and
sigh
dreams
keep
thou
thy
dreams
though
joy
should
pass
thee
by
hold
to
the
rainbow
beauty
of
thy
thought
it
is
for
dreams
that
men
will
die
and
count
the
passing
pain
of
death
as
nought
keep
though
thy
dreams
though
faith
should
faint
and
fail
and
time
should
loose
thy
fingers
from
the
creeds
the
vision
of
the
christ
will
still
avail
to
lead
thee
on
to
truth
and
tender
deeds
keep
thou
thy
dreams
all
the
winter
cold
when
weeds
are
withered
and
the
garden
grey
dream
thou
of
roses
with
their
hearts
of
gold
beckon
to
summers
that
are
on
their
way
keep
thou
thy
dreams
the
tissue
of
all
wings
is
woven
first
of
them
from
dreams
are
made
the
precious
and
imperishable
things
whose
loveliness
lives
on
and
does
not
fade
keep
thou
thy
dreams
intangible
and
dear
as
the
blue
ether
of
the
utmost
sky
a
dream
may
lift
thy
spirit
past
all
fear
and
with
the
great
may
set
thy
feet
on
high
before
the
dawn
in
that
one
darkest
hour
before
the
dawn
is
here
each
soul
of
us
goes
sailing
close
to
the
coast
of
fear
there
in
the
windless
quiet
from
out
the
folded
black
the
things
we
have
forgotten
or
would
forget
come
back
old
sorrows
long
abandoned
or
kept
with
lock
and
key
steal
from
their
prison
places
to
bear
us
company
all
softly
come
our
little
sins
our
scarlet
sins
and
gray
to
keep
with
us
a
vigil
till
breaking
of
the
day
and
there
are
velvet
footsteps
or
oft
we
seem
to
hear
light
garments
brush
against
the
dark
so
near
so
very
near
then
heavily
as
weighed
by
tears
each
haunted
moment
goes
for
dawn
steps
down
the
morning
sky
in
robes
of
gray
and
rose
o
fairies
of
the
and
little
men
in
green
and
pixies
of
the
moonlight
and
elves
no
eye
hath
seen
brew
us
a
magic
potion
of
deep
and
fairy
power
a
draught
of
lethe
for
one
night
to
tide
us
past
that
hour
crosses
all
your
broken
heroes
lord
of
war
and
grief
you
pay
with
a
cross
of
moulded
iron
iron
cold
and
grey
on
the
somme
you
grant
five
thousand
and
five
thousand
at
verdun
at
the
dawn
of
day
you
count
them
and
at
setting
of
the
sun
on
the
trampled
fields
of
flanders
on
the
bitter
roads
of
france
where
the
big
guns
chant
their
and
the
crimson
dance
there
you
count
the
iron
crosses
of
such
high
and
far
renown
grim
and
grey
the
men
who
win
them
theirs
the
cross
and
yours
the
crown
but
the
little
wooden
crosses
you
have
given
the
peaceful
dead
o
the
little
wooden
crosses
by
each
young
head
though
the
tender
grasses
hide
them
or
they
fall
beneath
the
snows
not
a
cross
shall
be
forgotten
god
himself
has
counted
those
the
cry
they
have
laid
him
away
even
he
who
was
always
so
strong
and
gay
will
be
locked
in
the
earth
till
the
judgment
day
dust
unto
dust
i
have
heard
the
priest
say
he
will
never
return
though
i
weep
my
eyes
blind
though
i
pray
and
yearn
though
the
goes
out
and
the
great
suns
burn
into
whitest
ash
he
will
never
return
so
of
weeping
no
more
it
is
tears
fill
the
oceans
from
shore
to
shore
they
have
made
the
wind
salt
the
wind
at
my
door
they
harm
the
good
ground
so
of
weeping
no
more
not
again
not
again
do
you
hear
the
sea
singing
that
one
refrain
the
pine
trees
the
wind
and
the
wearysome
rain
all
whisper
it
never
again
not
again
who
can
tell
me
who
knows
where
his
lonely
soul
travels
whither
it
goes
has
he
gone
like
the
leaves
like
yesterday
snows
speak
dear
lord
of
death
you
who
died
and
arose
a
war
chant
o
england
thy
foe
hath
hated
thee
long
and
his
hate
is
a
deadly
thing
it
was
held
in
his
heart
till
its
growth
was
strong
now
words
have
woven
it
into
a
song
for
little
children
to
sing
it
is
hatred
that
fashioned
his
shot
and
shell
and
hatred
hid
death
in
the
sea
in
hatred
the
cannon
have
sounded
a
knell
the
little
homes
where
the
peaceful
dwell
and
the
be
thy
foe
hath
swept
the
blue
from
the
sky
in
a
fury
of
smoke
and
flame
his
guns
are
not
stilled
where
the
wounded
lie
he
hath
shown
no
pity
to
those
who
die
for
the
glory
of
his
name
he
sealed
his
hate
with
the
blood
of
his
men
o
the
young
in
their
coats
of
grey
they
are
cast
aside
and
in
river
and
fen
where
none
will
find
them
again
till
the
last
white
judgment
day
now
mirth
is
forgotten
and
joy
is
dead
the
world
hath
accepted
its
pain
still
over
old
battlefields
newly
red
the
shattered
ranks
of
his
army
are
led
in
pomp
and
a
high
disdain
thy
anger
grows
slowly
for
thou
art
great
o
england
thou
well
beloved
land
when
its
tide
is
then
thou
art
fate
and
the
angel
who
stands
before
the
gate
the
sword
of
flame
in
his
hand
when
jonquils
blow
when
jonquils
blow
i
think
of
one
who
sleeps
beneath
the
green
and
all
the
light
and
song
of
life
and
all
the
golden
sheen
turn
cold
and
still
before
my
eyes
while
boughs
of
may
seen
through
a
sudden
mist
of
tears
are
rimmed
with
to
one
who
sleeps
fare
not
too
far
my
own
down
ways
all
strange
and
new
for
i
must
find
alone
the
road
that
leads
to
you
enchantments
may
arise
to
lure
thy
little
feet
and
charm
thy
wondering
eyes
yet
wait
for
me
my
sweet
already
earth
doth
seem
a
phantom
place
to
me
and
thy
far
home
of
dream
is
my
reality
so
this
is
just
good
night
some
stars
will
rise
and
wane
but
sure
as
comes
the
light
i
be
with
thee
again
the
sea
the
sea
is
just
a
cradle
wide
and
deep
a
cradle
that
the
moon
rocks
to
and
fro
what
peace
they
find
who
there
fall
fast
asleep
what
lovely
dreams
is
not
for
us
to
know
but
god
hath
sent
the
angel
of
the
sea
to
sing
to
them
an
endless
lullaby
and
that
they
may
not
dread
night
mystery
he
lights
for
them
the
candles
of
the
sky
they
are
infolded
by
the
silken
waves
and
wrapped
in
shining
blue
and
emerald
green
they
drift
through
opalescent
ocean
caves
that
only
god
himself
hath
ever
seen
the
great
salt
wind
that
no
man
holds
in
thrall
touches
them
softly
as
it
passes
by
i
think
the
silver
sea
gulls
know
them
all
and
greet
them
with
their
lonely
tender
cry
for
but
a
little
little
round
of
years
the
sweet
foam
will
be
their
bed
and
they
will
slumber
hushed
from
any
fears
to
waken
when
the
sea
gives
up
her
dead
comrades
o
mighty
men
of
england
who
sleep
on
land
and
sea
how
swiftly
you
would
join
our
ranks
if
death
could
set
you
free
how
gladly
would
they
greet
you
the
young
the
brave
the
gay
if
you
came
from
your
graves
to
march
with
them
o
you
would
know
each
other
and
meet
as
friend
with
friend
and
fight
and
smile
and
jest
at
death
until
the
battles
end
requiem
weep
for
the
dead
weep
for
the
swift
slain
dead
november
skies
too
few
the
tears
that
day
and
night
are
shed
from
women
eyes
blow
them
lightly
with
a
soft
caress
wind
of
the
sea
if
you
are
tender
they
may
miss
love
less
where
they
be
come
gentle
moon
swing
low
your
lantern
light
on
reddened
fields
and
find
the
lonely
harvest
of
the
night
that
battle
yields
banish
the
darkness
filled
with
quivering
dread
lest
they
should
know
some
last
strange
horror
even
they
the
dead
sweet
moon
swing
low
fold
them
at
dawn
dear
earth
within
your
arms
so
safe
and
strong
hold
them
asleep
till
they
forget
alarms
and
woe
and
wrong
master
of
kings
if
peace
be
bought
with
pain
these
paid
the
price
o
show
thy
tortured
world
that
not
in
vain
is
sacrifice
lament
here
in
my
garden
where
the
tulips
grow
i
walk
alone
dim
are
my
eyes
with
tears
my
feet
are
slow
my
heart
is
stone
though
all
the
lovely
earth
again
for
me
new
sweetness
yields
it
matters
not
only
the
dead
i
see
on
battlefields
only
the
dead
i
see
and
strangely
bright
their
faces
shine
as
though
the
god
of
glory
in
the
night
had
made
them
fine
place
for
the
victors
stoop
my
soul
to
touch
their
tunics
hem
is
those
they
loved
who
need
tears
overmuch
o
weep
for
them
