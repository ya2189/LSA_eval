illustration

a
friend
bright
gift
of

dedicate
this
house
of
the
secret
it
was
the
house
of
quietness
to
which
i
came
at
dusk
the
garth
was
lit
with
roses
and
heavy
with
their
musk
the
tremulous
tall
poplar
trees
stood
whispering
around
the
gentle
flicker
of
their
plumes
more
quiet
than
no
sound
and
as
i
wondered
at
the
door
what
magic
might
be
there
the
lady
of
sweet
silences
came
softly
down
the
stair
only
a
matter
of
time
time
sweet
swift
and
shallow
stream
here
like
a
boulder
lies
this
afternoon
across
your
eager
flow
so
you
shall
stay
deepened
and
dammed
to
let
me
breathe
and
be
your
troubled
fluency
your
running
gleam
shall
pause
and
circle
idly
still
and
clear
the
while
i
lie
and
search
your
glassy
pool
where
gently
coiling
in
their
lazy
round
unseparable
minutes
drift
and
swim
eddy
and
rise
and
brim
and
i
will
see
how
many
crystal
bubbles
of
slack
time
the
mind
can
hold
and
cherish
in
one
now
for
one
conscious
vacancy
of
sense
the
stream
is
gathered
in
a
deepening
pond
not
a
mere
moving
mirror
through
the
sharp
correct
reflection
of
the
standing
scene
the
mind
can
dip
and
cleanse
itself
with
rest
and
see
slow
spinning
in
the
lucid
gold
your
liquid
motes
imperishable
time
it
can
not
be
the
runnel
slips
away
the
clear
smooth
downward
sluice
begins
again
more
brightly
slanting
for
that
trembling
pause
leaving
the
sense
its
conscious
vague
unease
as
when
a
sonnet
flashes
on
the
mind
trembles
and
burns
an
instant
and
is
gone
at
the
mermaid
cafeteria
truth
is
enough
for

should

could

quaint
old
dwelling
i
desire
with
books
and
pictures
bravely
filled
and
chairs
beside
an
open
fire
rooms
with
candles
lit
i
lie
awake
to
think
of
it
a
dial
for
the
sunny
hours
a
garden
of
flowers
say
marigolds
and
lavender
and
mignonette
and
and
and
maidenhair
and
candytuft
and
thyme
and
rue
all
these
for
you
to
wander
in
a
chinese
carp
called
waving
a
sluggish
silver
fin
deep
in
the
moat
so
tame
he
comes
to
lip
your
fingers
offering
crumbs
tall
chimneys
like
long
listening
ears
white
shutters
ivy
green
and
thick
and
walls
of
ruddy
tudor
brick
grown
mellow
with
the
passing
years
and
windows
with
small
leaded
panes
broad
for
when
it
rains
a
big
blue
bowl
of
pot
pourri
and
yes
a
spanish
chestnut
tree
to
coin
the
autumn
minted
gold
a
summer
house
for
drinking
tea
all
these
just
think
for
you
and
me
a
staircase
of
the
old
black
wood
cut
in
the
days
of
robin
hood
and
banisters
worn
smooth
as
glass
down
which
your
hand
will
lightly
pass
a
piano
with
pale
yellow
keys
for
wistful
twilight
melodies
and
dusty
bottles
in
a
bin
all
these
for
you
to
revel
in
but
when
ah
well
until
that
time
we
habit
in
this
house
of
rhyme
on
naming
a
house
when
i
a
householder
became
i
had
to
give
my
house
a
name
i
thought
i
call
it
poplar
trees
or
widdershins
or
velvet
bees
or
just
beneath
a
star
i
thought
of
house
where
plumbings
freeze
or
as
you
like
it
if
you
please
or
nicotine
or
bread
and
cheese
full
moon
or
doors
ajar
but
still
i
sought
some
subtle
charm
some
rune
to
guard
my
roof
from
harm
and
keep
the
devil
far
i
thought
of
this
and
i
was
saved
i
had
my
engraved
house
where
brown
eyes
a
memory
do
you
remember
heart
desire
the
night
when
first
came
the
newly
dedicated
fire
the
hearth
unsanctified
by
flame
how
anxiously
we
swept
the
bricks
how
tragic
were
the
draught
not
right
and
then
the
blaze
enwrapped
the
sticks
and
filled
the
room
with
dancing
light
we
could
not
speak
but
only
gaze
nor
half
believe
what
we
had
seen
home
hearth
golden
blaze
cider
mugs
and
then
a
thought
occurred
to
me
we
ran
outside
with
sudden
shout
and
looked
up
at
the
roof
to
see
our
own
dear
smoke
come
drifting
out
and
of
all
man
felicities
the
very
subtlest
one
say
i
is
when
for
the
first
time
he
sees
his
hearthfire

against
the
sky

refusing

immortality

i
should
tell
unstinted
your
beauty
and
your
grace
all
future
lads
would
whisper
traditions
of
your
face
if
i
made
public
tumult
your
mirth
your
queenly
state
posterity
would
grumble
that
it
was
born
too
late
i
will
not
frame
your
beauty
in
bright
undying
phrase
nor
blaze
it
as
a
legend
for
unborn
men
to
praise
for
why
should

lovers
be

how

it
hang

the

purse
on
saturdays

the
baby
is
bathed
fed

his
mother
as
quickly
as
may

rapidly

herself
pretty

with
her

purse

trips
through
the
crowd

the
station

the
rendezvous

where
we
meet

keeping
her
eyes

temptation
she
avoids

most
windowy
street

is
off
for

weekly
adventure

her
comrade

better

worse

says
never

spent
your
last
bit
here
the
fat
little
purse
apart

thrifty
exchequer

has
hidden

must
not
be
spent

the
butcher

baker

the
rest

gleeful

disburse

a
richness

innocent

he
knows
not

so
many

as
life
about
him
by

all
its

he
watches
with

at

tired
he

the

of

clumsy

to

the

they
show
by

on
this
brave
world
where
few
such
meteors
fell
her
youngest
son
to
save
us
beauty
flung
he
suffered
and
descended
into
hell
and
comforts
yet
the
ardent
and
the
young
drunken
of
moonlight
dazed
by
draughts
of
sky
dizzy
with
stars
his
mortal
fever
ran
his
utterance
a
cry
not
free
from
folly
for
he
too
was
man
and
now
and
here
a
hundred
years
away
where
topless
towers
shadow
golden
streets
the
young
men
sit
nooked
in
a
cheap
perfectly
happy
talking
about
keats
to
a
sonnet
in
sunlight
this
is
a
day
for
sonnets
oh
how
clear
our
splendid
cliffs
and
summits
lift
the
gaze
if
all
the
perfect
moments
of
the
year
were
poured
and
gathered
in
one
sudden
blaze
then
then
perhaps
in
some
endowered
phrase
my
flat
strewn
words
would
rise
and
come
more
near
to
tell
of
you
your
beauty
and
your
praise
would
fall
like
sunlight
on
this
paper
here
then
i
would
build
a
sonnet
that
would
stand
proud
and
perennial
on
this
pale
bright
sky
so
tall
so
steep
that
it
might
stay
the
hand
of
time
the
dusty
wrecker
he
would
sigh
to
tear
my
strong
words
down
and
he
would
say
that
song
he
built
for
her
one
summer
day
quickening
such
little
puny
things
are
words
in
rhyme
poor
feeble
loops
and
strokes
as
frail
as
hairs
you
see
them
printed
here
and
mark
their
chime
and
turn
to
your
more
durable
affairs
yet
on
such
petty
tools
the
poet
dares
to
run
his
race
with
mortar
bricks
and
lime
and
draws
his
frail
stick
to
the
point
and
stares
to
aim
his
arrow
at
the
heart
of
time
intangible
yet
pressing
hemming
in
this
measured
emptiness
engulfs
us
all
and
yet
he
points
his
paper
javelin
and
sees
it
eddy
waver
turn
and
fall
and
feels
between
delight
and
trouble
torn
the
stirring
of
a
sonnet
still
unborn
at
a
window
sill
write
a
sonnet
needs
a
quiet
mind
i
paused
and
pondered
tried
again

raising
the
sash
i
breathed
the
winter
night
papers

left
behind
against

from

height

is
no

in

burns

not
then
beauty
will
tinder
it
is
for
every
blowing
spark
uncertain
whether
this
is
bliss
or

the
unresting

will
gaze
across

the

then
from
off
some
distant

that
gluey
savor
on
the

breeze
the
burning
bulbs
in
green

white
and
red

out
a
of

a

with

there
is
a
sense
of
poising
near
the

of
some
great
flume
of
brightness
flowing
by
to
pour
in
gathering
torrent
through
the
dark

below

and
in

a

on

and
just
about
ten
minutes
after

tossing
a
surf
of

to
the
sky
it
bursts
in
cataracts
upon
times
square
of

epitaph
for
a
poet
who
wrote
no
poetry
it
is
said
that
a
poet
has
died
young
in
the
breast
of
the
most
stolid
robert
louis
stevenson
what
was
the
service
of
this
poet
he
who
blinked
the
blinding
that
run
where
life
profiles
its
edges
to
the
sun
and
still
suspected
much
he
could
not
see
yet
in
his
taciturnity
there
lay
the
vein
of
glory
known
to
none
and
moods
of
secret
smiling
only
won
when
peace
and
passion
time
and
sense
agree
fighting
the
world
he
loved
for
chance
to
brood
ignorant
when
to
embrace
when
to
avoid
his
loves
that
held
him
in
their
vital
clutch
this
was
his
service
his
beatitude
this
was
the
inward
trouble
he
enjoyed
who
knew
so
little
and
who
felt
so
much
sonnet
by
a
geometer
the
circle
few
things
are
perfect
we
bear
eden
scar
yet
faulty
man
was
godlike
in
design
that
day
when
first
with
stick
and
length
of
twine
he
drew
me
on
the
sand
then
what
could
mar
his
joy
in
that
obedient
mystic
line
and
then
computing
with
a
zeal
divine
he
called
and
knew
my
lovely
circuit
r
a
circle
is
a
happy
thing
to
be
think
how
the
joyful
perpendicular
erected
at
the
kiss
of
tangency
must
meet
my
central
point
my
avatar
they
talk
of
points
yet
only
determine
every
circle
to
a
vaudeville
terrier
seen
on
a
leash
in
the
park
three
times
a
day
at
two
at
seven
at
nine
o
terrier
you
play
your
little
part
absurd
in
coat
and
skirt
you
push
a
cart
with
inner
anguish
walk
a
line
up
there
before
the
hot
and
dazzling
shine
you
must
be
rigid
servant
of
your
art
nor
watch
those
fluffy
cats
your
doggish
heart
might
leap
and
then
betray
you
with
a
whine
but
sometimes
when
you
faithfully
rehearsed
your
trainer
takes
you
walking
in
the
park
straining
to
sniff
the
grass
to
chase
a
frog
the
leash
is
slipped
and
then
your
joy
will
burst
adorable
it
is
to
run
and
bark
to
be
alas
how
seldom
just
a
dog
illustration
must
be
rigid
servant
of
your
art
to
an
old
friend
for
lloyd
williams
i
like
to
dream
of
some
established
spot
where
you
and
i
old
friend
an
evening
through
under
tobacco
fog
streaked
gray
and
blue
might
reconsider
laughters
unforgot
beside
a
and
hot
i
hear
you
tell
the
oddities
men
do
the
clock
would
tick
and
we
would
sit
we
two
life
holds
such
meetings
for
us
does
it
not
happy
are
men
when
they
have
learned
to
prize
the
sure
unvarnished
virtue
of
their
friends
the
unchanged
kindness
of
a
face
on
old
fidelities
our
world
depends
and
runs
a
simple
course
in
honest
wise
not
a
mere
taxicab
shot
wild
through
space
to
a
burlesque
soubrette
upstage
the
great
beefy
choir
squawked
in
watts
of
orange
glare
you
came
and
impudent
and
danced
where
the
gutter
flamed
with
footlight
fire
flung
from
the
roof
spots
red
and
yellow
burned
and
followed
you
the
blatant
brassy
clang
of
instruments
drowned
out
the
words
you
sang
but
goldenly
you
capered
twirled
and
turned
boyish
and
slender
quick
and
proud
a
sprite
of
irresistible
disdain
fair
as
a
jonquil
in
an
april
rain
you
seemed
too
sweet
an
imp
for
that
dull
crowd
and
then
behind
the
scenes
i
heard
you
say
gawd
i
got
a
hellish
cold
illustration
came
and
impudent
and
where
the
gutter
flamed
with
footlight
thoughts
while
packing
a
trunk
the
sonnet
is
a
trunk
and
you
must
pack
with
care
to
ship
frail
baggage
far
away
the
octet
is
the
trunk
sestet
the
tray
tight
but
not
overloaded
is
the
knack
first
at
the
bottom
heavy
thoughts
you
stack
and
in
the
chinks
your
adjectives
you
lay
your
phrases
folded
neatly
as
you
may
stowing
a
syllable
in
every
crack
then
in
the
tray
your
daintier
stuff
is
hid
the
tender
quatrain
where
your
moral
sings
be
careful
though
lest
as
you
close
the
lid
you
crush
and
crumple
all
these
fragile
things
your
couplet
snaps
the
hasps
and
turns
the
key
ship
to
the
editor
marked
streets
i
have
seen
streets
where
strange
enchantment
broods
old
ruddy
houses
where
the
morning
shone
in
seemly
quiet
on
their
tranquil
moods
across
the
sills
white
curtains
outward
blown
their
marble
steps
were
scoured
as
white
as
bone
where
scrubbing
housemaids
toiled
on
wounded
knee
and
yet
among
all
streets
that
i
have
known
these
placid
byways
give
least
peace
to
me
in
such
a
house
where
green
light
shining
through
from
some
back
garden
framed
her
silhouette
i
saw
a
girl
heard
music
blithely
sung
she
stood
there
laughing
in
a
dress
of
blue
and
as
i
went
on
slowly
there
i
met
an
old
old
woman
who
had
once
been
young
to
the
only
begetter
i
i
have
no
hope
to
make
you
live
in
rhyme
or
with
your
beauty
to
enrich
the
years
enough
for
me
this
now
this
present
time
the
greater
claim
for
greater
sonneteers
but
o
how
covetous
i
am
of
now
dear
human
minutes
marred
by
human
pains
i
want
to
know
your
lips
your
cheek
your
brow
and
all
the
miracles
your
heart
contains
i
wish
to
study
all
your
changing
face
your
eyes
divinely
hurt
with
tenderness
i
hope
to
win
your
dear
unstinted
grace
for
these
blunt
rhymes
and
what
they
would
express
then
may
you
say
when
others
better
prove
for
their
style
i
read
his
for
his
to
the
only
begetter
ii
when
all
my
trivial
rhymes
are
blotted
out
vanished
our
days
so
precious
and
so
few
if
some
should
wonder
what
we
were
about
and
what
the
little
happenings
we
knew
i
wish
that
they
might
know
how
night
by
night
my
pencil
heavy
in
the
sleepy
hours
sought
vainly
for
some
gracious
way
to
write
how
much
this
love
is
ours
and
only
ours
how
many
evenings
as
you
drowsed
to
sleep
i
read
to
you
by
tawny
and
watched
you
down
the
valley
dim
and
deep
where
poppies
and
the
april
flowers
grow
then
knelt
beside
your
pillow
with
a
prayer
and
loved
the
breath
of
pansies
in
your
hair
pedometer
my
thoughts
beat
out
in
sonnets
while
i
walk
and
every
evening
on
the
homeward
street
i
find
the
rhythm
of
my
marching
feet
throbs
into
verses
though
the
rhyme
may
balk
i
think
the
sonneteers
were
walking
men
the
form
is
dour
and
rigid
like
a
clamp
but
with
the
swing
of
legs
the
tramp
tramp
tramp
of
syllables
begins
to
thud
and
then
lo
while
you
seek
a
rhyme
for
or
vanished
your
shabby
coat
and
you
are
kith
to
all
great
meredith
and
shakespeare
wordsworth
keats

rupert
brooke
free
verse

poor
for

that
was

so
heedless
of
thy

have
armed
thee
to
strike
me
down

given
thee

my

parceled
out

little
hands

brown
bright
eyes
and
in
a

these
will
put
me
to
the
test

since
there
are
these
pitiful
poor
chinks
upon
the
makeshift
armor
of
my
heart
for
thee
no
honor
lies
in
such
a
fight
and
thou
wouldst

planning
how
they
run
and
yet
when
midnight
comes
and
paper
lies
clean
white
receptive
all
that
one
can
ask
alas
for
drowsy
spirit
weary
eyes
and
traitor
hand
that
fails
the
well
loved
task
who
ever
learned
the
sonnet
bitter
craft
but
he
had
put
away
his
sleep
his
ease
the
wine
he
loved
the
men
with
whom
he
laughed
to
brood
upon
such
thankless
tricks
as
these
and
yet
such
joy
does
in
that
craft
abide
he

apothecary
henry
once
worked
in

where
once
he
measured
camphor
glycerine
quinine
and
potash
peppermint
in
bars
and
all
the
oils
and
essences
so

the

of

dispenses
sadness
tinctured
with

laughter
that
dissolves

again
o
brave
apothecary
you
who
knew
what
dark
and
acid
doses
life
prefers
and
yet
with
friendly
face
resolved
to
brew
these
sparkling
potions
for
your
customers
in
each
prescription
your
physician
writ
you
poured
your
rich
compassion
and
your
wit
for
the
centenary
of
keats
sonnet
on
first
looking
into
chapman
homer
i
knew
a
scientist
an
engineer
student
of
tensile
strengths
and
calculus
a
man
who
loved
a
cantilever
truss
and
always
wore
a
pencil
on
his
ear
my
friend
believed
that
poets
all
were
queer
and
literary
folk
ridiculous
but
one
night
when
it
chanced
that
three
of
us
were
reading
keats
aloud
he
stopped
to
hear
lo
a
new
planet
swam
into
his
ken
his
eager
mind
reached
for
it
and
took
hold
ten
years
are
by
i
see
him
now
and
then
and
at
alumni
dinners
if
cajoled
he
mumbles
gravely
to
the
cheering
men
have
i
travelled
in
the
realms
of
two
night
after
night
goes
by
and
clocks
still
chime
and
stars
are
changing
patterns
in
the
dark
and
watches
tick
and
time
benumbs
the
eager
brain
the
dogs
that
bark
the
trains
that
roar
and
rattle
in
the
night
the
very
cats
that
prowl
all
quiet
find
and
leave
the
darkness
empty
silent
quite
sleep
comes
to
chloroform
the
fretting
mind
so
all
things
end
and
what
is
left
at
last
some
scribbled
sonnets
tossed
upon
the
floor
a
memory
of
easy
days
gone
past
a
watch
a
pipe
some
clothes
we
wore
and
in
the
darkened
room
i
lean
to
know
how
warm
her
dreamless
breath
does
pause
and
flow
the
commercial
traveller
ah
very
sweet
if
news
should
come
to
you
some
afternoon
while
waiting
for
our
eve
that
the
great
manager
had
made
me
leave
to
travel
on
some
territory
new
and
that
whatever
homeward
winds
there
blew
i
could
not
touch
your
hand
again
nor
heave
the
logs
upon
our
hearth
and
bid
you
weave
some
wistful
tale
before
the
flames
that
grew
then
when
the
sudden
tears
had
ceased
to
blind
your
pansied
eyes
i
wonder
if
you
could
remember
rightly
and
forget
aright
remember
just
your
lad
uncouthly
good
forgetting
when
he
failed
in
spleen
or
spite
could
you
remember
him
as
always
kind
the
wedded
lover
i
read
in
our
old
journals
of
the
days
when
our
first
love
was
and
new
how
fair
it
blossomed
and
grew
despite
the
adverse
time
and
our
amaze
at
moon
and
stars
and
beauty
beyond
praise
that
burgeoned
all
about
us
gold
and
blue
the
heaven
arched
us
in
and
all
we
knew
was
gentleness
we
walked
on
happy
ways
they
said
by
now
the
path
would
be
more
steep
the
sunsets
paler
and
less
mild
the
air
rightly
we
heeded
not
it
was
not
true
we
will
not
tell
the
secret
let
it
keep
i
know
not
how
i
thought
those
days
so
fair
these
being
so
much
fairer
spent
with
you
to
you
remembering
the
past
when
we
were
parted
sweet
and
darkness
came
i
used
to
strike
a
match
and
hold
the
flame
before
your
picture
and
would
breathless
mark
the
answering
glimmer
of
the
tiny
spark
that
brought
to
life
the
magic
of
your
eyes
their
wistful
tenderness
their
glad
surprise
holding
that
mimic
torch
before
your
shrine
i
used
to
light
your
eyes
and
make
them
mine
watch
them
like
stars
set
in
a
lonely
sky
whisper
my
heart
out
yearning
for
reply
summon
your
lips
from
far
across
the
sea
bidding
them
live
a
twilight
hour
with
me
then
when
the
match
was
shrivelled
into
gloom
lo
you
were
with
me
in
the
darkened
room

miss
was
resigned
and
composed
at
the

but
it
was
from
her
malady
then
in

type

that

dead
she
observed
on
his

when
asleep

apprehended

i
hear
their
voices
still
the
stammering
one
struggling
with
some
absurdity
of
jest
her
quiet
words
that
puzzle
and
protest
against
the
latest
outrage
of
his
fun
so
wise
so
simple
has
she
never
guessed
that
through
his
laughter
love
and
terror
run
for
when
her
trouble
came
and
darkness
pressed
he
smiled
and
fought
her
madness
with
a
pun
through
all
those
years
it
was
his
task
to
keep
her
gentle
heart
serenely
mystified
if
fate
an
artist
this
should
be
his
pride
when
in
that
christmas
season
he

my

with

sleepy

i
heard
her
sing
and
rock
him
and
the
creak
of
the
swaying
chair
and
the
old
dear
cadence
of
the
words
came
softly
down
the
stair
and
all
the
years
had
vanished
all
folly
greed
and
stain
the
old
old
song
the
creaking

this

and
they

the
noble
rage
and
instancy
of
life
all

blurred
the
sudden
mood
of
truth
that
gave
them
birth
the
last
sonnet
suppose
one
knew
that
never
more
might
one
put
pen
to
sonnet
well
loved
task
that
now
these
fourteen
lines
were
all
he
could
allow
to
say
his
message
be
forever
done
how
he
would
scan
the
word
the
line
the
rhyme
intent
to
sum
in
dearly
chosen
phrase
the
windy
trees
the
beauty
of
his
days
life
pride
and
pathos
in
one
verse
sublime
how
bitter
then
would
be
regret
and
pang
for
former
rhymes
he
dallied
to
refine
for
every
verse
that
was
not
crystalline
and
if
belike
this
last
one
feebly
rang
honor
and
pride
would
cast
it
to
the
floor
facing
the
judge
with
what
was
done
before
the
savage
civilization
causes
me
alternate
fits
disgust
and
glee
buried
in
piles
of
glass
and
stone
my
private
spirit
moves
alone
where
every
day
from
eight
to
six
i
keep
alive
by
hasty
tricks
but
i
am
simple
in
my
soul
my
mind
is
sullen
to
control
at
dusk
i
smell
the
scent
of
earth
and
i
am
dumb
too
glad
for
mirth
i
know
the
savors
night
can
give
and
then
and
then
i
live
i
live
no
man
is
wholly
pure
and
free
for
that
is
not
his
destiny
but
though
i
bend
i
will
not
break

still
be

cage
your
poets
hem
them
in
and

them
round
with

ceaseless

and
never

the
telephone
directory
no
malory
of

no
crusoe
tale
it
seems
to
me
can
equal
in
rich
circumstance
this
telephone
directory
no
ballad
of
fair
ladies
eyes
no
legend
of
proud
knights
and
dames
can
fill
me
with
such
bright
surmise
as
this
great
book
of
numbered
names
how
many
hearts
and
lives
unknown
rare
damsels
pining
for
a
squire
are
waiting
for
the
telephone
to
ring
and
call
them
to
the
wire
some
wait
to
hear
a
loved
voice
say
the
news
they
will
rejoice
to
know
at
rome
j
or
marathon
and
some
perhaps
are
stung
with
fear
and
answer
with
reluctant
tread
the
message
they
expect
to
hear
means
life
or
death
or
daily
bread
a
million
hearts
here
wait
our
call
all
naked
to
our
distant
speech
i
wish
that
i
could
ring
them
all
and
have
some
welcome
news
for
each
green
escape
at
three
in
the
afternoon
on
a
hot
september
day
i
began
to
dream
of
a
highland
stream
and
a
frostbit
russet
tree
of
the
swashing
dip
of
a
clipper
ship
white
canvas
wet
with
spray
and
the
swirling
green
and
clean
along
her
canted
lee
i
heard
the
quick
staccato
click
of
the
typist
pounding
keys
and
i
had
to
brood
of
a
wind
more
rude
than
that
by
a
motor
fanned
and
i
lay
inert
in
a
flannel
shirt
to
watch
the
rhyming
seas
deploy
and
fall
in
a
silver
sprawl
on
a
beach
of
sand
there
is
no
desk
shall
tame
my
lust
for
hills
and
windy
skies
my
secret
hope
of
the
sea
blue
slope
no
clerkly
task
shall
dull
and
though
i
print
no
echoed
hint
of
adventures
i
devise
my
eyes
still
pine
for
the
comely
line
of
an
outbound
vessel
hull
when
i
elope
with
an
autumn
day
and
make
my
green
escape
i
leave
my
pen
to
tamer
men
who
have
more
docile
souls
for
forest
aisles
and
office
files
have
a
very
different
shape
and
it
hard
to
woo
the
ocean
blue
in
a
row
of
pigeon
holes
illustration
eyes
still
pine
for
the
comely
an
outbound
vessel
vesper
song
for
commuters
of
marathon
the
commuter
may
name
of
his
favorite
the
stars
are
kind
to
marathon
how
low
how
close
they
lean
they
jostle
one
another
and
do
their
best
to
please
indeed
they
are
so
neighborly
that
in
the
twilight
green
one
reaches
out
to
pick
them
behind
the
poplar
trees
the
stars
are
kind
to
marathon
and
one
particular
bright
planet
which
is
vesper
most
lucid
and
serene
is
waiting
by
the
railway
bridge
the
good
commuter
star
the
star
of
wise
men
coming
home
on
time
at
the
ice
wagon
i
like
to
split
the
sky
that
roofs
us
down
break
through
the
crystal
lid
of
upper
air
and
tap
the
cool
still
reservoirs
of
heaven
i
empty
all
those
unseen
lakes
of
freshness
down
some
vast
funnel
through
our
stifled
streets
i
like
to
pump
away
the
grit
the
dust
raw
dazzle
of
the
sun
on
garbage
piles
the
droning
troops
of
flies
sharp
bitter
smells
and
gush
that
bright
sweet
flood
of
unused
air
down
every
alley
where
the
children
gasp
and
then
i
take
a
fleet
of
ice
wagons
big
yellow
creaking
carts
drawn
by
wet
horses
and
drive
them
rumbling
through
the
blazing
slums
in
every
wagon
would
be
blocks
of
coldness
pale
gleaming
cubes
of
ice
all
green
and
silver
with
inner
veins
and
patterns
white
and
frosty
great
lumps
of
chill
would
drip
and
steam
and
shimmer
and
spark
like
rainbows
in
their
little
fractures
and
where
my
wagons
stood
there
would
be
puddles
a
wetness
and
a
sparkle
and
a
coolness
my
friends
and
i
would
chop
and
splinter
open
the
blocks
of
ice
bare
feet
would
soon
come
pattering
and
some
would
wrap
it
up
in
sunday
papers
and
some
would
stagger
home
with
it
in
baskets
and
some
would
be
too
gay
for
aught
but
sucking
licking
crunching
those
fast
melting
pebbles
gulping
as
they
slipped
down
unexpected
laughing
to
perceive
that
secret
numbness
amid
their
small
hot
persons
at
every
stop
would
be
at
least
one
urchin
would
take
a
piece
to
cool
the
sweating
horses
and
hold
it
up
against
their
silky
noses
and
they
would
start
and
then
decide
they
liked
it
down
all
the
byways
of
the
town
our
wagons
would
be
trailed
by
grimy
tots
their
ragged
shirts
half
off
them
with
excitement
dabbling
toes
and
fingers
in
our
leakage
a
lucky
few
up
sitting
with
the
driver
all
clambering
and
stretching
palms
and
by
the
time
the
wagons
were
all
empty
our
arms
and
shoulders
would
be
lame
with
chopping
our
backs
and
thighs
our
fingers
frozen
but
how
we
would
recall
those
eager
faces
red
thirsty
tongues
with
sliding
on
them
the
pinched
white
cheeks
and
their
pathetic
gladness
then
we
would
know
that
arms
were
made
for
aching
i
wish
to
god
that
i
could
go
tomorrow
at
a
movie
theatre
how
well
he
spoke
who
coined
the
phrase
picture
palace
aye
in
sooth
a
palace
where
men
weary
days
are
crowned
with
kingliness
of
youth
strange
palace
crowded
airless
dim
where
toes
are
trod
and
strained
eyes
smart
we
watch
a
wand
of
brightness
limn
the
old
heroics
of
the
heart
romance
again
hath
us
in
thrall
and
love
is
sweet
and
always
true
and
in
the
darkness
of
the
hall
hands
clasp
as
they
were
meant
to
do
remote
from
peevish
joys
and
ills
our
souls
are
purged
and
free
we
see
the
sun
on
western
hills
the
crumbling
tumult
of
the
sea
we
are
the
blond
that
maidens
crave
well
balanced
at
a
dozen
banks
by
sleight
of
hand
we
haste
to
save
a
life
nor
stay
for
thanks
alas
perhaps
our
instinct
feels
life
is
not
all
it
might
have
been
so
we
applaud
fantastic
reels
of
shadow
cast
upon
a
screen
sonnets
in
a
lodging
house
i
each
morn
she
crackles
upward
tread
by
tread
all
apprehensive
of
some
hideous
sight
perhaps
the
fourth
floor
back
who
reads
in
bed
forgot
his
gas
and
let
it
burn
all
night
the
sweet
young
thing
who
has
the
middle
room
she
much
suspects
for
once
some
ink
was
spilled
and
then
the
plumber
in
an
hour
of
gloom
found
all
the
bathroom
pipes
with
filled
no
league
of
nations
scheme
can
make
her
gay
she
knows
the
rank
duplicity
of
man
some
folks
expect
clean
towels
every
day
they
get
away
with
murder
if
they
can
she
tacks
a
card
alas
few
roomers

across
the
court
there
rises
the
back
wall
of
the
magna
carta
apartments
the
other
evening
the
people
in
the
apartment
opposite
had
forgotten
to
draw
their
curtains
i
could
see
them
dining
the
cloth
the
silver
and
glass
the
crystal
water
jug
the
meat
and
vegetables
and
their
clean
pink
hands
outstretched
in
busy
gesture
it
was
pleasant
to
watch
them
they
were
so
human
so
gay
innocent
unconscious
of
scrutiny
they
were
four
an
elderly
couple
a
young
man
and
a
girl
with
lovely
shoulders
mellow
in
the
glow
of
the
lamp
they
were
sitting
over
coffee
and
i
could
see
their
hands
talking
at
last
the
older
two
left
the
room
the
boy
and
girl
looked
at
each
other
like
a
flash
they
leaned
and
kissed
good
old
human
race
that
keeps
on
multiplying
a
little
later
i
went
down
the
street
to
the
movies
and
there
i
saw
all
four
laughing
and
joking
together
and
as
i
watched
them
i
felt
like
god
benevolent
and
tender
rapid
transit
to
stephen
vincent
climbing
is
easy
and
swift
on
parnassus
knocking
my
pipe
out
i
entered
a
bookshop
there
found
a
book
of
verse
by
a
young
poet
comrades
at
once
how
i
saw
his
mind
glowing
saw
in
his
soul
its
magnificent
rioting
then
i
ran
with
him
on
hills
that
were
windy
basked
and
laughed
with
him
on
beaches
glutted
myself
on
his
green
and
blue
twilights
watched
him
disposing
his
planets
in
patterns
tumbling
his
colors
and
toys
all
before
him
i
questioned
life
with
him
his
pulses
my
pulses
doubted
his
doubts
too
and
grieved
for
his
anguishes
salted
long
kinship
and
knew
him
from
pulled
out
my
own
sun
and
stars
from
my
knapsack
trying
my
trinkets
with
those
of
his
finding
as
i
left
the
pipe
was
still
warm
in
my
caught
in
the
undertow
colin
worshipping
some
frail
by
sways
her
calls
himself
unworthy
male
hardly
even
fit
to
praise
her
but
this
tactic
insincere
in
the
upshot
greatly
grieves
him
when
he
finds
the
lovely
dear
quite
implicitly
believes
him
to
his
mistress
rallied
him
for
praising
blue
eyes
in
his
if
sometimes
in
a
random
phrase
for
variation
in
my
ditty
i
chance
blue
eyes
or
gray
to
praise
and
seem
to
intimate
them
pretty
it
is
because
i
do
not
dare
with
too
unmixed
reiteration
to
sing
the
browner
eyes
and
hair
that
are
my
true
intoxication
know
then
that
i
consider
brown
for
ladies
eyes
the
only
color
and
deem
all
other
orbs
in
town
compared
to
yours
opaquer
duller
i
pray
perpend
my
dearest
dear
while
maids
the
praise
were
drinking
how
insubstantial
was
their
cheer
it
was
of
yours
that
i
was
thinking
peace
what
is
this
peace
that
statesmen
sign
how
i
have
sought
to
make
it
mine
where
groaning
cities
clang
and
glow
i
hunted
hunted
peace
to
know
and
still
i
saw
where
i
passed
by
discarded
hearts
heard
children
cry
by
willowed
waters
brimmed
with
rain
i
thought
to
capture
peace
again
i
sat
me
down
my
peace
to
hoard
but
beauty
pricked
me
with
a
sword
for
in
the
stillness
something
stirred
and
i
was
crippled
for
a
word
there
is
no
peace
a
man
can
find
the
anguish
sits
his
heart
behind
the
eyes
he
loves
the
perfect
breast
too
exquisite
to
give
him
rest
this
is
his
curse
since
brain
began
his
penalty
for
being
man

deprecation
of

so
the

thou
art

away
thou
art
safe
to
contemplate

when

when
down
the
hall
i
heard
a
trill
a
tiny
tinkling
tuneful
air
his
his
toy
his
crib
companion
every
night
and
now
he
turned
to
it
for
joy
while
waiting
for
the
lagging
light
how
clear
and
how
absurdly
sad
those
tingling
pricks
of
sound
unrolled
they
chirped
and
quavered
as
the
lad
his
lonely
little
heart
consoled
the
ocean
its
only
tune
shrilled
sweet
and
faint
he
cranked
the
chimes
admiring
them
in
vigil
gay
without
complaint
the
treble
music
piped
and
stirred
the
leaping
air
that
was
his
bliss
and
as
i
most
contritely
heard
i
thanked
the
swiss
the
needled
jets
of
melody
rang
slowlier
and
died
away
the
urchin
slept
and
it
was
i
who
lay
and
waited
for

darling
jean
was
jean
armour
a
comely
country
lass
whom
burns
met
at
a
penny
wedding
at
mauchline
they
chanced
to
be
dancing
in
the
same
quadrille
when
the
poet
dog
sprang
to
his
master
and
almost
upset
some
of
the
dancers
burns
remarked
that
he
wished
he
could
get
any
of
the
lasses
to
like
him
as
well
as
his
dog
did
some
days
afterward
jean
seeing
him
pass
as
she
was
bleaching
clothes
on
the
village
green
called
to
him
and
asked
him
if
he
had
yet
got
any
of
the
lasses
to
like
him
as
well
as
his
dog
did
that
was
the
beginning
of
an
acquaintance
that
coloured
all
of
burns

man
when
you
came
prancing
all
glee
to
see
your
robin
dancing
his
partner
muslin

mischancing
you
leaped
for
joy
and
little
guessed
what
sweet
romancing
you
caused
my
boy
with
happy
bark
that
moment
jolly
you
frisked
and
frolicked
faithful
collie
his
other
dog
old
melancholy
was
put
to
flight
but
what
a
tale
of
grief
and
folly
you
wagged
that
night
ah
luath
tyke
your
bonny
master
whose
lyric
pulse
beat
ever
faster
each
time
he
saw
a
lass
and
passed
her
his
breast
went
bang
in
many
a
woful

disaster
he
felt
the
pang
poor
robin
heart
forever
burning
forever
roving
ranting
yearning
from
you
that
heart
might
have
been
learning
to
be
less
fickle
might
have
been
spared
so
many
a
turning
and
grievous
prickle
your
collie
heart
held
but
one
notion
when
robbie
jigged
in
sprightly
motion
you
ran
to
show
your
own
devotion
and
gambolled
too
and
so
that
tempest
on
love
ocean
was
due
to
you
well
it
is
ower
late
for
preaching
and
hearts
are
aye
too
hot
for
teaching
when
robin
with
his
eye
beseeching
by
greenside
came
jeanie
poor
lass
forgot
her
bleaching
and
yours
the
blame
thoughts
on
reaching
land
i
had
a
friend
whose
path
was
pain
oppressed
by
all
the
cares
of
earth
life
gave
him
little
chance
to
drain
his
secret
cisterns
of
rich
mirth
his
work
was
hasty
harassed
vexed
his
dreams
were
laid
aside
perforce
until
in
this
world
or
the
next
his
trade
newspaper
man
of
course
what
funded
wealth
of
tenderness
what
ingots
of
the
heart
and
mind
he
must
uneasily
repress
beneath
the
rasping
daily
grind
but
now
and
then
and
with
my
aid
for
fear
his
soul
be
wholly
lost
his
devoir
to
the
grape
he
paid
to
call
soul
back
at
any
cost
then
liberate
from
discipline
undrugged
by
caution
and
control
through
all
his
veins
came
flooding
in
the
virtued
passion
of
his
soul
his
spirit
bared
and
felt
no
shame
with
holy
light
his
eyes
would
shine
see
truth

acolyte
reclaim
after
the
second
glass
of
wine
the
self
that
life
had
trodden
hard
aspired
was
generous
and
free
the
glowing
heart
that
care
had
charred
grew
flame
as
it
was
meant
to
be
a
pox
upon
the
canting
lot
who
call
the
glass
the

some
sot
defiles

suffolk
villages
serene
with
lads
at
cricket
on
the
green
and
wytham
strawberries
so
ripe
and
in
my
pipe
in
those
dear
days
in
those
dear
days
all
pleasant
lay
the
country
ways
the
echoes
of
our
stalwart
mirth
went
echoing
wide
around
the
earth
and
in
an
endless
bliss
of
sun
we
lay
and
watched
the
river
run
and
you
by
cam
and
i
by
isis
were
happy
with
our
own
devices
ah
can
we
ever
know
again
such
friends
as
were
those
chosen
men
such
men
to
drink
to
bike
to
smoke
with
to
worship
with
or
lie
and
joke
with
never
again
my
lads
we
see
the
life
we
led
at
never
again
perhaps
shall
i
go
flashing
bravely
down
the
high
to
see
in
that
transcendent
hour
the
sunset
glow
on
magdalen
tower
dear
rupert
brooke
your
words
recall
those
endless
afternoons
and
all
your
cambridge
which
i
loved
as
one
who
was
her
grandson
not
her
son
o
ripples
where
the
river
slacks
in
greening
eddies
round
the
backs
where
men
have
dreamed
such
gallant
things
under
the
old
stone
bridge
at
or
leaned
to
feed
the
silver
swans
by
the
tennis
meads
at
o
granta
water
cold
and
fresh
kissing
the
warm
and
eager
flesh
under
the
willow
breathing
stir
the
bathing
pool
at
what
words
can
tell
what
words
can
praise
the
burly
savor
of
those
days
dear
singing
lad
those
days
are
dead
and
gone
for
aye
your
golden
head
and
many
other
men
will
never
dine
in
hall
again
i
too
have
lived
remembered
hours
in
cambridge
heard
the
summer
showers
make
music
on
old
pane
while
i
was
reading
pepys
or
taine
through
and
i
used
to
roll
on
at
my
lamp
would
light
and
sleep
in
for
the
night
or
to
miles
from
i
used
to
scull
and
sit
and
swear
while
wasps
attacked
my
bread
and
jam
those
summer
evenings
on
the
cam
o
crispy
english
baked
in
ovens
not
in
stoves
o
white
unsalted
english
butter
o
satisfaction
none
can
utter
to
think
that
while
those
joys
i
knew
in
cambridge
i
did
not
know

his

say
he
trod
most
heavily
upon

also

that
in

there
was
the
