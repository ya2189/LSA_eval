the

i

a

a
little
reed
down
by
the

a
whim
of
god
whose
moment
need
was
that
the
giver
might
blow
melodious
and
long
one
cadence
of
eternal
song
through
me
are
blown
wild
whisperings
of

from

no

hath
known
the
splendour
that

dim
unto
dark
and
great

refrain
fades
to
a

is

when
like

riseth
melodious
and
strong
that
cadence
of
eternal
song
god
is
the
piper
i
the
reed
down
by
the
river
for
his
need
one
note
in
those
vast
melodies
waited
on
me
or
else
the
choral
companies
went
silently
complaining
to
the
muted
stars
what
lack
we
yet
that
discord
bars
that
infinite
processional
or
else
the
seraphim
would
call

your

let
fall
and
break
the

a
little

a
little
reed
and
yet
were
silence
of
that
song
failed
i
the
river
pebbled

nor
trembled
never
unto
him
the

passing
where
we
throng
vibrant
and
ready
for

o
miracle
he
who
in
beauty
goeth
by
the
marches
of
the
meadowy
sky
on
the
many
reeds
his
canticle
paused
in
his
playing
for
he
found
an
failed
of
the
music
that
he
made
wild
winds
went
straying
like
sheep
lost
on
the
daisied
meads
scattered
by
discord
and
afraid
lost
from
the
fold
they
knew
of
old
my
god
had
need
of
one
more
reed
had
need
of
me
to
make
the
perfect
harmony
i
am
that
that
needed
note
eternally
the
piper
tried
reed
after
reed
until
he
found
me
growing
by
the
and
laughing
at
the
leaves
that
float
forever
down
its
burnished
tide
how
frail
my
body
is
how
frail
and
common
of
its
kind
a
reed
among
a
field
of
reeds
to
the
wind
the
wind
that
threshes
like
a
flail
until
my
body
bleeds
yet
through
me
such
wild
music
blows
the
piper
laughs
among
the
stars
know
you
the
piper
little
scars
burn
on
his
brow
each
shoulder
shows
wounds
of
a
knotted
scourge
that
fell
to
hurt
him
from
the
hands
of
hell
welcome
o
wind
all
hail
o
pain
one
little
reed
one
little
reed
to
fill
the
piper
far
refrain
is
broken
till
its
body
bleed
glad
that
the
minstrel
lord
doth
find
a
tone
of
his
eternal
need
aldebaran
the
minstrel
tuned
the
triple
strings
his
harp
of
many
murmurings
then
on
a
mighty
chord
began
a
song
of
bright
aldebaran
i
aldebaran
aldebaran
one
night
i
saw
thee
rise
above
the
peaks
of
ispahan
red
on
those
purple
skies
thou
wast
a
royal
ruby
stone
set
in
a
diadem
of
some
great
god
upon
his
throne
whose
garment
ample
hem
was
margined
with
the
clustered
spheres
beyond
a
myriad
of
years
above
thee
soared
the
pleiades
beneath
auriga
flared
his
vast
melodic
harmonies
rigel
with
algol
shared
space
trembled
to
the
minstrelsy
of
deneb
and
alcyone
ii
aldebaran
aldebaran
betelguese
sheathed
his
sword
and
in
that
cosmic
cry
began
the
music
of
his
word
he
spoke
in
syllables
so
strong
each
sentence
was
an
æon
long
thou
art
he
thundered
the
first
star
to
lead
earth
out
of
mist
when
man
looked
up
and
felt
afar
urge
of
an
ancient
tryst
made
ere
god
lit
the
morning
sun
to
mark
the
length
of
day
begun
thou
threshold
of
the
zodiac
thou
portal
of
the
rooms
thou
first
step
of
the
starry
track
thou
shuttle
of
the
looms
where
fate
weaves
threads
of
purest
gold
to
fashion
god
wide
hail
and
all
hail
from
every
sphere
that
rolled
across
the
void
i
heard
aldebaran
with
fear
each
clustered
asteroid
flung
back
the
tumult
of
that
cry
like
through
the
sky
iii
then
vega
rose
and
on
her
lyre
played
tremulous
vast
chords
singing
the
infinite
desire
of
those
celestial
lords
who
shouted
when
earth
loom
was
laid
and
through
the
warp
god
shuttle
played
when
through
the
loom
of
misted
flame
the
threads
of
god
began
to
weave
a
world
before
there
came
adventuring
of
man
upon
the
path
of
life
to
find
monitions
of
eternal
mind
she
sang
of
forest
and
of
fell
of
mountain
and
of
moor
caves
and
the
caveman
the
song
beside
the
door
where
women
ground
the
meal
and
sung
rhymes
in
their
rude
primeval
tongue
i
saw
the
mammoth
and
the
bear
like
moving
mountains
run
in
terror
from
the
spear
proving
that
man
had
won
lordship
of
earth
and
i
made
prayer
aldebaran
before
thee
there
iv
arcturus
lifted
high
his
horn
and
blew
a
mighty
blast
the
curtain
of
the
night
was
torn
to
show
the
protoplast
transfigured
on
the
finer
face
of
that
far
prehistoric
race
we
clumsy
call
lemurian
a
city
lifted
high
its
towered
domes
of
daring
man
beneath
a
tropic
sky
with
gates
of
gold
that
gleamed
and
shone
brighter
than
portaled
babylon
men
were
as
gods
upon
the
earth
the
women
were
most
fair
music
was
speech
a
holy
birth
of
art
was
cradled
there
for
dreams
took
shape
in
pure
jacinth
seraphic
brows
upon
the
plinth
reed
instruments
for
dance
and
song
brave
horns
beneath
the
blue
the
sistrum
and
the
the
pipe
and
tabour
too
and
all
the
craft
of
minstrelsy
harp
sackbut
cymbal
psaltery
were
fashioned
then
was
genius
stirred
to
lines
and
drama
grew
on
earth
was
heard
praise
of
the
fruitful
vines
oil
of
the
olive
leaping
of
lambs
within
the
fold
told
was
the
story
of
the
stars
and
thine
aldebaran
when
jupiter
was
not
nor
mars
when
every
pointed
and
named
the
olden
spheres
while
rome
was
in
the
womb
of
years
v
altair
in
aquila
stood
forth
with
flaming
evil
brow
looked
from
his
tower
to
the
north
and
made
an
awful
vow
i
will
destroy
yon
golden
gates
hither
to
me
o
shrouded
fates
hither
to
me
and
hide
the
sun
darken
the
noisy
noon
snuff
out
the
planets
one
by
one
unleash
the
hot
simoon
destroy
the
race
lemurian
and
they
obeyed
aldebaran
thunder
a
woman
by
the
well
looked
up
and
fell
a
shepherd
leading
forth
his
sheep
gasped
clutched
his
throat
and
found
eternal
sleep
ceased
in
the
temple
horn
and
holy
drum
and
all
the
vested
choristers
were
dumb
rain
as
of
fire
the
shivering
of
earth
dead
is
the
baby
at
its
birth
with
horror
in
her
great
dark
eyes
the
mother
lifeless
lies
two
lovers
in
the
spell
of
their
first
kiss
and
whispered
word
the
dark
abyss
engulfs
forever
night
endless
night
there
are
no
towers
temples
domes
no
palaces
no
pillared
homes
and
all
that
stately
company
are
buried
in
a
boiling
sea
alas
for
these
aldebaran
and
woe
to
altair
and
his
hate
gone
is
the
race
lemurian
i
weep
o
star
to
sing
their
fate
vi
and
for
a
while
the
court
was
still
tense
waiting
on
the
harpist
will
from
lord
and
lady
to
the
king
one
spoke
it
was
an
evil
thing
one
hush
he
is
about
to
sing
the
jester
shook
his
golden
bells
and
laughed
a
pretty
tale
he
tells
of
altair
and
aldebaran
faith
never
since
began
was
heard
the
lemurian
a
bishop
raised
his
mitred
head
it
was
the
flood
i
think
he
said
aye
even
so
replied
a
priest
was
not
that
city
in
the
east
altair
apocalyptic
beast
then
spake
the
king
upon
his
throne
never
such
harping
have
i
known
it
is
a
right
majestic
tale
how
poetry
and
song
prevail
on
sword
and
shield
and
burnished
mail
again
the
minstrel
tuned
the
strings
his
harp
of
many
murmurings
again
on
softer
chord
began
the
song
of
bright
aldebaran
vii
aldebaran
aldebaran
last
night
i
saw
thee
glow
in
taurus
open
like
a
fan
above
a
world
of
snow
the
joyous
bells
were
ringing
wide
their
plangent
silver
chime
proclaiming
it
is
christmastide
now
is
the
time
the
time
the
holy
babe
was
brought
to
birth
and
lord
messias
came
to
earth
wast
thou
not
then
that
eastern
star
the
magi
did
behold
who
journeyed
from
a
city
far
to
offer
gifts
of
gold
the
star
of
jesu
leading
them
to
little
bethlehem
aldebaran
aldebaran
across
the
crystal
sky
a
shout
of
began
glory
to
god
on
high
on
earth
be
peace
now
is
the
morn
in
which
emmanuel
is
born
they
sang
the
end
of
every
woe
the
tale
of
every
tear
i
saw
a
host
of
singers
go
bravely
against
the
fear
that
held
men
in
the
thongs
of
fate
through
æons
of
the
hell
of
hate
before
thy
lance
altair
went
down
lemuria
arose
restored
to
temple
palace
crown
with
gates
that
never
close
and
all
her
shining
company
renewed
their
art
and
minstrelsy
the
babe
was
in
his
mother
arms
his
face
was
like
the
christ
and
that
lost
lover
knew
the
charms
of
her
who
kept
the
tryst
the
woman
filled
her
water
jar
the
shepherd
led
his
sheep
afar
and
then
i
knew
aldebaran
lemuria
is
one
with
all
the
domes
of
daring
man
that
glitter
to
the
sun
that
age
by
age
one
broad
highway
leads
up
the
host
to
fuller
day
there
shall
no
lost
tall
towers
be
no
idle
aim
of
art
no
useless
joy
of
minstrelsy
no
heart
no
utter
silencing
of
song
no
comrade
absent
from
the
throng
through
pain
and
trial
of
the
tears
lead
up
the
host
o
star
lead
up
lead
up
until
the
years
have
glorified
the
scar
that
burns
upon
the
brow
of
man
aldebaran
aldebaran
comrades
come
dear
comrade
let
us
sing
not
to
any
tightened
string
struck
by
harpers
when
they
play
let
us
like
the
morning
wind
shout
with
an
unfettered
mind
anthems
of
the
common
day
challenge
as
the
waves
the
shore
whoso
limits
what
we
pour
protestant
of
any
strain
other
than
old
minstrels
know
follow
where
the
spume
flakes
blow
down
the
world
and
back
again
we
will
run
the
glad
earth
round
splinter
with
a
lance
of
sound
cliffs
that
front
the
swelling
tide
till
the
mute
soul
is
set
free
unto
love
and
liberty
unafraid
and
satisfied
we
will
let
the
fancy
run
climb
into
the
setting
sun
leap
from
it
upon
the
moon
laugh
at
all
the
broken
bars
down
betwixt
us
and
the
stars
vainly
builded
by
the
noon
play
my
comrade
through
the
trees
luting
ancient
litanies
laugh
with
every
fronded
fern
sit
with
daisies
in
the
grass
let
the
river
hold
a
glass
to
your
eyes
and
look
and
learn
gaily
go
upon
all
roads
not
like
cattle
pricked
with
goads
for
the
towered
town
walled
with
pearl
and
chrysolite
lies
beyond
the
tarn
of
night
past
the
broken
bridge
of
sorrow
after
the
order
of
melchisedec
i
am
a
priest
upon
whose
head
god
long
ago
poured
holy
oil
he
gave
to
me
a
word
and
said
with
this
thou
shalt
mankind
assoil
since
i
went
forth
god
to
obey
life
has
revealed
me
many
things
i
find
it
very
hard
to
say
what
is
most
dear
the
task
that
brings
bread
to
the
eater
or
the
rest
that
follows
toil
the
love
of
friends
of
books
of
song
each
is
most
blessed
and
always
with
contentment
blends
a
stone
a
faggot
or
a
flower
a
bird
in
rapture
of
its
flight
or
the
velvet
vastness
of
the
night
when
mother
moon
has
left
the
stars
and
with
the
winds
gone
gossiping
or
leans
upon
the
gate
that
bars
dawn
from
untimely
entering
these
hold
for
me
unending
charm
fill
me
with
wonderment
and
awe
that
men
should
ever
think
of
harm
fencing
their
lives
about
with
law
the
world
is
such
a
lovely
place
a
jewelled
pendant
on
love
chain
i
marvel
that
a
human
face
should
pale
with
anger
or
with
pain
i
marvel
at
the
cry
for
bread
that
thunders
round
the
waking
world
the
tumult
of
the
legion
tread
that
shakes
the
earth
as
souls
are
hurled
in
battle
to
destroy
the
souls
god
grew
in
his
great
garden
when
he
won
past
all
his
other
goals
triumphant
at
the
birth
of
men
who
can
behold
the
dance
of
dawn
juggling
with
stars
like
tinselled
balls
vestured
in
mantle
of
a
wan
white
glory
whose
dim
splendour
falls
upon
the
mountains
and
not
feel
himself
transcendant
who
can
hear
clangour
of
wild
birds
and
the
peal
of
across
the
clear
blue
sky
commingling
with
the
shout
of
children
on
their
way
to
school
and
fail
at
once
to
be
about
god
business
as
within
a
pool
you
are
reflected
nature
shows
the
miracle
of
what
you
are
the
highest
that
creation
knows
lord
of
the
earth
and
every
star
i
am
a
priest
upon
whose
head
god
long
ago
poured
holy
oil
he
gave
to
me
a
word
and
said
with
this
thou
shalt
mankind
assoil
i
come
from
out
the
holy
place
with
benediction
for
the
earth
to
wipe
the
tears
from
every
face
and
tell
the
fallen
one
his
worth
my
business
is
to
be
a
priest
whose
holy
task
is
to
forgive
to
bid
the
beggar
to
the
feast
to
touch
the
dead
and
make
them
live
i
know
not
any
fear
of
thrones
no
claim
of
scribe
and
pharisee
my
word
is
set
to
many
tones
of
lute
and
harp
and
psaltery
i
have
no
temple
and
no
creed
i
celebrate
no
mystic
rite
the
human
heart
is
all
i
need
wherein
i
worship
day
and
night
the
human
heart
is
all
i
need
for
i
have
found
god
ever
there
love
is
the
one
sufficient
creed
and
comradeship
the
purest
prayer
i
bow
not
down
to
any
book
no
written
page
holds
me
in
awe
for
when
on
one
friend
face
i
look
i
read
the
prophets
and
the
law
i
need
no
fountain
filled
with
blood
to
cleanse
my
soul
from
mortal
sin
for
love
is
an
unbounded
flood
freely
i
go
to
wash
therein
love
laughs
at
boundaries
of
wrath
and
is
as
infinite
as
god
breaks
down
each
wall
finds
out
each
path
where
wilful
straying
feet
have
trod
love
is
the
word
god
gave
and
said
with
it
thou
shalt
mankind
assoil
then
forthwith
poured
upon
my
head
anointing
of
his
holy
oil
o
little

o
little
pale
pilgrim
of
dreams
do
you
know
the
names
of
the
flowers
the
ferns
by
the
pools
and
the
streams
the
kisses
of
god
in
the
showers
do
you
hear
his
hello
on
the
hills
where
a
wind
comes
out
of
the
cloud
and
fail
of
the
magic
that
fills
companions
who
meet
in
the
crowd
thou
slow
of
the
heart
to
believe
thou
blind
of
the
eyes
to
behold
let
go
of
the
things
that
deceive
vain
baubles
of
silver
and
gold
come
out
and
be
one
with
the
throng
your
brothers
who
wait
by
the
way
and
sing
the
new
liberty
song
at
the
doors
of
the
day
companion
of
flower
and
fern
a
brother
of
christ
and
the
clod
and
one
with
all
spirits
that
yearn
the
realized
image
of
god
the
centuries
wait
for
thy
wings
and
æons
have
followed
thee
far
lay
hold
of
the
sceptre
of
things
thou
lord
of
the
atom
and

a
song
of

i
will
sing
of
evolution
a
song
of
the

a
song
of
the
star
a
song
of
the
soul
god
is
the
name
of
two
lovers
each
other
eternally
wooing
love
and
life
love
is
all
light
and
is
lonely
until
he
finds
life
life
too
is
lonely
until
in
her
seeking
love
has
been
found
over
the
peaks
and
the
plains
of
an
infinite
universe
these
lovers
are
ever
each
other
finding
and
losing
whenever
they
meet
there
is
birth
whenever
they
part
there
is
death
birth
and
death
what
does
it
mean
we
are
born
what
does
it
mean
that
we
die
i
make
answer
that
which
of
love
and
of
life
is
begotten
fails
as
to
form
of
itself
only
not
self
but
its
eidolon
fails
so
love
and
life
part
to
prepare
for
self
new
forms
birth
is
a
form
of
the
self
once
more
appearing
self
who
is
child
of
these
lovers
eternally
wooing
how
many
births
deaths
have
we
known
eternally
going
out
of
the
urge
of
love
for
life
we
are
the
sons
of
the
highest
atom
and
star
and
flesh
these
are
but
forms
of
the
soul
amoeba
mastodon
man
but
forms
of
the
soul
forever
ascending
the
soul
is
more
than
the
form
abides
there
merely
a
moment
the
soul
is
a
pilgrim
housed
for
the
night
in
a
hostel
new
habitations
meet
for
his
needs
are
provided
yea
they
are
builded
by
love
and
by
life
builded
by
them
for
their
only
begotten
a
song
of
the
trinity
i
believe
in
one
god
the
almighty
love
is
the
father
eternal
life
is
the
mother
infinite
spouse
of
the

this
is
my

in

i
am
well
pleased
or
ever
the
stars
were
hung
in
their
purple
places
or
ever
the
moon
grew
languid
with
love
for
the
earth
or
ever
the
day
flamed
forth
on
the
hills
in
eager
pursuit
of
the
reluctant
arms
of
the
night
life
cradled
our
son
in
the
atom
we
fashioned
and
floated
on
waves
of
ether
cradled
our
son
and
waited
till
æons
went
by
fulfilling
the
passive
soft
years
of
his
childhood
waited
until
he
builded
strange
cities
by
rivers
that
flowed
from
the
gold
of
the
sands
of
the
desert
waited
until
his
white
body
was
nailed
on
a
cross
in
pledge
that
love
is
the
lover
of
life
and
father
of
the
soul
a
song
of
the
mother
i
am
life
love
only
precedes
me
long
ere
the
pollen
grew
gold
on
the
bee
flitting
from
flower
to
flower
laden
with
honey
long
ere
the
song
of
the
bird
chorused
back
to
the
choirs
of
winds
coming
down
from
earth
altars
the
hills
long
ere
the
lamb
bleated
back
to
the
dam
through
the
void
and
the
waste
of
the
upland
pastures
love
found
me
and
i
found
love
on
my
breast
have
i
carried
the
soul
have
laid
him
to
rest
at
the
end
of
a
day
with
a
dream
and
a
song
through
the
dream
how
oft
he
has
risen
awaked
at
my
word
reclothed
by
my
hand
how
oft
have
i
let
him
go
free
to
the
toys
and
the
tasks
while
he
grew
in
stature
and
wisdom
dear
is
my
son
in
the
strength
of
his
great
growing
godhood
a
song
of
the
son
my
cradle
was
the
atom
on
the
breast
of
the
sea
i
slumbered
through
a
long
æonian
night
and
wakened
on
the
morning
of
the
world
the
fern
and
the
shrub
and
the
tree
were
my
playmates
the
wind
was
my
nurse
singing
me
wild
songs
i
stretched
out
my
hands
to
the
rain
and
grew
glad
in
the
sun
i
dreamed
of
my
sisters
the
stars
of
my
brother
the
moon
i
was
housed
with
the
cattle
for
them
i
opened
the
doors
of
speech
turned
their
dull
dreams
to
the
words
of
a
song
to
him
of
the
fang
i
was
terror
in
the
light
of
my
face
he
was
furtive
shrank
back
to
his
den
ceasing
to
tear
with
his
teeth
i
had
learned
to
stand
on
my
feet
to
smite
with
my
hands
to
hurl
a
huge
stone
at
python
and
tiger
i
roared
with
wild
laughter
in
the
light
of
my
brother
the
moon
i
danced
with
my
mate
to
the
dance
of
my
sisters
the
stars
at
dawn
i
went
forth
to
hurl
with
the
hammer
or
thrust
with
the
spear
and
grew
heavy
from
hunting
i
returned
to
the
cave
and
saw
her
white
body
naked
against
the
sun
red
in
the
west
on
the
mountains
i
drew
near
to
my
love
who
saw
me
and
sang
the
song
of
the
hunter
home
from
the
hunting
the
babe
at
her
breast
she
held
up
and
danced
in
her
arms
for
his
father
danced
till
he
croodled
and
crowed
dimpled
with
joy
of
his
father
for
them
i
builded
a
hut
of
saplings
and
wattles
and
she
with
her
fingers
fashioned
bowls
from
the
clay
we
dreamed
as
we
toiled
we
sang
as
we
dreamed
and
ever
the
task
took
the
form
of
our
song
we
dreamed
that
the
wilderness
blossomed
that
the
meadows
thickened
with
ripening
corn
yellow
and
green
in
the
noontide
we
sang
of
the
millet
and
wheat
of
the
barley
and
rye
and
the
purple
hanging
down
from
the
vine
we
sang
of
the
flax
and
the
oil
of
the
olive
after
the
time
of
the
sound
of
the
flails
on
the
floor
we
dreamed
that
a
city
rose
out
of
the
jungle
a
city
of
towers
and
walls
of
palaces
statues
and
pictures
so
great
was
our
love
that
though
we
died
by
birth
we
came
back
to
keep
tryst
with
each
other
she
was
proud
semiramis
helen
of
troy
was
she
hers
was
the
song
of
miriam
and
the
hands
of
jael
once
was
her
dear
name
sappho
singing
the
song
of
the
cave
of
him
who
hurled
with
the
stone
the
hunter
home
from
the
hunting
where
the
nile
is
an
amber
bow
she
dreamed
and
waited
for
me
coming
down
in
my
trireme
of
war
enslaved
at
her
smile
so
through
the
ages
we
met
so
through
the
ages
we
parted
each
time
that
we
met
after
the
silence
that
sundered
fairer
and
fairer
was
she
and
i
grew
more
like
a
god
cleansed
and
made
strong
by
the
tears
shed
for
the
sorrow
we
suffered
till
one
day
we
stood
in
a
garden
a
little
green
garden
of
lilies
hard
by
a
tomb
that
was
open
wide
to
the
joy
of
the
morning
there
in
the
hush
of
the
dayspring
breathing
of
lilies
white
as
the
snow
upon
hermon
we
knew
that
our
love
was
immortal
out
of
the
wildness
we
had
grown
us
a
rose
out
of
its
thorns
we
had
fashioned
a
crown
te
deum
praise
god
for
all
things
praise
him
for
birth
praise
him
for
death
praise
him
for
health
praise
him
for
sickness
for
sorrow
and
sin
for
gladness
and

for
failure
and

for

and
for

praise
god
for
all

god
is

all

and

as

from
him
angels
of

angels
of

of

through

of
your
godhood

done
with

and
the
pillowing

awake
over
vast
spaces
the
winds
are
blown
to

and
bear
you
from
shadowing
sleep
up
the
high
places
seraphim
faces
brighten
and
burn
as
the
disk
of
the
sun
stands
on
the
brow
of
yon
mountain
to
keep
guard
of
your
path
till
the
journey
is
done
the
king
of
glory
give
us
this
day
a
man
so
strong
he
will
not
falter
in
his
song
muting
his
instrument
to
please
the
pharisees
he
must
be
one
to
whom
a
child
comes
with
sweet
laughter
reconciled
from
tears
because
he
passes
by
like
a
white
cloud
in
yonder
sky
women
shall
claim
him
for
a
friend
hail
him
as
brother
gladly
spend
the
price
of

for
his

at
his
tomb
when
he
is
dead
from
seat
of
customs
or
the
nets
workshop
or
plough
or
minarets
men
will
respond
to
his
clear
call
and
in
his
battles
proudly
fall
this
lord
must
be
no
shrouded
form
of

incarnate
but
the
norm
of
manhood
for
an
eager
age
our

sage
if

be
missing
of
the
mark
sped
was
the
arrow
in
the
dark
with
light
shed
from
that
brother
face
each
bolt
shall
find
its
place
not
to
dead
yesterdays
but
now
belongs
that
wide
and
august
brow
from
whose
vast
mind
a
word
shall
be
spoken
to
set
free
fettered
by
the
ban
of
some
vatican
which
from
the
age
of
stone
to
this
cramped
them
by
every
artifice
he
will
lift
up
a
mighty
hand
against
oppression
will
demand
from
kings
and
councils
an
account
of
stewardship
of
the
amount
taken
by
them
in
turn
for
toil
that
starves
the
tiller
of
the
soil
will
seek
to
know
the
reason
why
the
millions
in
their
hunger
cry
his
clear
calm
eyes
will
pierce
excuse
of
man
defending
his
abuse
of
power
like
a
sword
will
be
dividing
of
his
word
he
will
not
quote
some
ancient
saw
a
text
of
scripture
from
the
law
nor
will
he
seek
by
miracle
to
blind
all
reason
he
will
tell
the
tyrant
and
the
turbaned
priest
because
ye
did
it
to
the
least
of
these
my
brothers
made
their

torn
into
the
hell
of
every
hate
vice
and
foul
lust
insatiate
descend
and
learn
what
ye
have
done
who
from
earth
children
stole
the
sun
stole
field
and
forest
mountain
river
pretending
that
some
royal
giver
bestowed
them
on
your
sculptored
sires
sleeping
beneath
their
ancient
spires
ye
who
have
taught
that
god
is
wrath
ye
who
have
driven
down
the
path
of
fear
the
frightened
souls
of
men
ye
who
have
made
his
house
a
den
for
thieves
to
bargain
gold
for
grace
ye
hypocrites
with
pious
faces
and
downcast
eyes
your
litanies
your
and
threnodies
rise
not
to
him
who
clothes
the
grass
with
glory
and
whose
holy
mass
is
in
the
olive
and
the
vine
not
in
your
wafer
and
your
wine
send
such
a
man
again
on
earth
as
he
whom
mary
brought
to
birth
and
whom
the
people
in
their
pride
rejected
and
then
crucified
only
o
god
of
stone
and
star
we
will
not
hale
him
to
the
bar
of
pilate
and
caïaphas
we
will
lift
up
the
gates
of
brass
and
open
wide
our
golden
doors
proclaiming
while
his
splendour
pours
over
the
world
he
comes
to
win
the
king
of
glory
shall
come
in
matins
good
morning
friend
what
of
the
night
through
yonder
cloud
one
shaft
of
light
shot
from
the
bow
of
hunter
day
strikes
on
the
world
his
bay
down
valleys
where
the
wheat
and
rye
their
gold
with
green
of
forest
vie
lift
up
your
head
behold
how
fair
creation
is
the
beats
billowing
upon
the
strand
of
endless
leagues
of
summer
land
and
freighted
ships
of
scented
bales
wild
blossoms
spread
their
tinctured
sails
see
how
god
with
an
artist
grace
gives
soul
to
every
beneath
his
touch
a
leaf
is
green
a
berry
red
mark
how
between
the
captive
daisies
come
and
pass
phalanxes
of
the
guarding
grass
the
night
was
dark
you
say
wild
fears
took
shape
on
of
tears
dim
phantoms
of
the
host
of
hate
pursued
you
down
the
gulfs
of
fate
smiting
you
with
their
up
steeps
of
weird
imaginings
my
friend
each
in
his
turn
has
known
night
and
her
shapes
of
fear
the
stone
of
striving
sisyphus
has
torn
all
who
have
dared
the
mount
of
morn
the
tree
where
buddha
vision
fell
was
planted
in
a
pit
of
hell
no
soul
has
seen
its
promised
land
who
felt
not
first
some
pharaoh
hand
behind
achievement
stir
and
stress
of
and
wilderness
learn
by
the
way
that
jesu
trod
how
from
the
brute
man
grows
a
god
who
stands
against
you
in
your
path
may
reap
with
you
your
aftermath
and
less
of
bitterness
than
bliss
is
stored
within
a
traitor
kiss
the
demon
who
holds
back
your
soul
will
crown
you
victor
at
the
goal
the
bugles
blow
the
trumpets
call
and
at
their
sound
the
towers
fall
beleaguered
bastions
are
down
within
yon
ancient
fortressed
town
go
up
and
let
each
cobbled
street
clang
back
to
your
triumphant
feet
a
cradle
song
of
life
lullaby

comes
night
with

when
you
awake
will
you
forget
all
the
old
toys
the
lessons
you
learned
the
bruises
that
hurt
when
you
fell
down
uncouthly
you
sprawled
and
frequently
fell
learning
to
walk
was
falling
a
sin
were
bruises
a
shame
baby
my
brave
little

what

you
dream
what
sounds
do
you
hear
out
of
the
splendour
out
of
the
wonder
out
of
the
peace
of
land
how
little
they
know
who
call
this
a
grave
is
but
a
cradle
and
death
is
a
sleep
from
which
you
will
waken
to
try
it
again
how
little
they
know
who
prattle
of
sin
and
tell
on
their
beads
misereres
for
grace
baby
must
fall
that
baby
may
rise
renewed
by
the
rest
made
strong
by

your

rocked
in

atom
and
nursed
in
the
star
swaddled
in
flesh

nor

afraid
that
i
will
fail
you
you
holder
of
fair
morning
heights
you
dancing
with
the
rosy
dawn
it
has
been
long
and
hard
for
me
this
task
of
slow
emergence
from
the
clod
still
prowl
about
me
in
the
shadows
their
fangs
are
sometimes
fastened
to
my
feet
so
that
i
can
not
walk
from
pain
of
them
so
that
i
halt
and
cry
out
lonely
in
the
night
sometimes
i
see
you
woman
you
the
watchful
waiting
one
of
ages
you
with
the
dawn
and
godlike
you
past
all
torment
that
i
know
you
the
understanding
sometimes
i
see
you
in
a
shaft
of
light
smiting
the
mists
of
valleys
where
i
call
dividing
them
as
with
a
sword
swung
by
an
angel
in
that
vision
rage
of
tusk
and
tooth
and
fang
falls
like
the
waves
in
their
foam
upon
the
scarlet
laughter
of
wild
poppies
i
have
deceived
you
you
in
turn
have
punished
me
have
punished
me
with
a
mere
semblance
of
yourself
a
figure
white
fleshed
with
wild
witcheries
of
ample
breasts
limbs
smooth
and
dimpled
as
for
kisses
a
dear
and
tender
fiction
of
yourself
a
fiction
of
yourself
that
did
escape
me
leaped
up
to
claim
those
hills
remote
from
me
until
i
learned
man
must
not
chain
a
woman
soul
o
woman
wait
for
me
be
patient
for
i
strive
out
of
the
shadow
where
the
brute
still
fastens
with
his
fang
my
bleeding
feet
my
weary
stumbling
feet
nor
be
afraid
that
i
will
fail
you
you
holder
of
far
morning
heights
you
dancing
with
the
dawn
a
song
of
the
new
gods
the
gods
of
vast
valhalla

silent
in
their
hall
zeus

not
from
olympus
jehovah

brothers
my
brothers
proclaim
this
the
sabbath
the
optimist
there
is
no
evil
anywhere
said
i
unto
the
priest
who
answered
life
is
cursed
with
care
sin
makes
of
man
a
beast
care
is
not
any
curse
i
cried
to
fail
is
not
to
sin
wherefore
upon
the
rood
christ
died
if
not
our
souls
to
win
because
a
hero
must
face
death
if
death
be
in
the
way
and
as
i
paused
to
take
my
breath
the
priest
began
to
say
son
you
forget
how
adam
fell
losing
his
high
estate
and
so
god
doomed
him
unto
hell
save
for
the
master
fate
yes
i
forget
and
gladly
too
that
ancient
hebrew
tale
how
god
began
a
thing
to
do
can
the
eternal
fail
can
he
who
rides
upon
the
storm
who
breathes
and
lo
the
stars
whose
thought
begets
a
with
leaves
for
avatars
can
he
who
crowns
the
grass
with
dew
and
gems
the
wood
with
rain
fail
of
his
purpose
my
priest
drew
his
breath
and
spoke
again
alas
my
son
your
words
are
wild
and
far
from
holy
faith
your
reason
is
of
one
beguiled
by
some
infernal
wraith
do
you
not
know
the
written
word
tells
of
our
father
fall
have
you
not
seen
have
you
not
heard
how
death
rules
over
all
there
is
no
death
i
quickly
said
and
he
but
all
must
die
now
is
christ
risen
from
the
dead
forthwith
i
made
reply
now
is
christ
risen
and
become
firstfruits
of
them
that
slept
and
lo
the
fluent
priest
was
dumb
he
was
like
one
who
wept
ah
you
have
suffered
you
have
sinned
have
known
the
dark
abyss
have
felt
upon
the
roaring
wind
the
phantom
of
a
kiss
you
have
looked
in
a
woman
eyes
lit
with
her
love
of
you
and
such
a
moment
made
you
wise
he
murmured
it
is
true
tell
me
o
priest
was
it
not
worth
eternity
of
hell
when
in
your
heart
dear
love
had
birth
tears
from
his
closed
eyes
fell
then
your
great
moment
gives
the
point
to
what
i
said
before
there
is
no
evil
you
anoint
the
spirit
open
door
a
dying
body
set
the
seal
of
some
old
covenant
as
though
the
spirit
did
not
feel
the
as
though
the
soul
were
not
god
son
knowing
as
he
is
known
who
hath
by
cross
and
passion
won
his
place
beside
the
throne
if
all
my
life
were
in
the
dark
and
dread
of
endless
doom
think
you
that
i
should
fail
the
spark
that
gleamed
athwart
the
gloom
my
moment
when
i
soared
to
bliss
upon
a
woman
lips
and
that
revealing
word
her
kiss
thrilled
to
my
finger
tips
nay
by
that
instant
i
should
know
evil
so
called
worth
while
accept
the
challenge
forward
go
bravely
against
the
mile
till
by
degrees
the
lengthened
space
should
give
me
stronger
thews
a
firmer
tread
a
purer
face
a
cruse
i
then
should
reach
a
gentler
hand
to
cripples
by
the
way
strike
off
the
fetters
loose
the
band
turn
night
into
the
day
my
tongue
would
be
a
tunèd
reed
my
throat
a
silver
horn
my
lips
for
fuller
faith
would
plead
from
even
unto
morn
i
should
not
waste
the
miracle
divine
the
gift
of
speech
with
fancied
images
of
hell
this
only
would
it
teach
if
god
with
lilies
keeps
a
tryst
then
he
will
also
keep
faith
with
that
moment
of
the
christ
who
walks
upon
the
deep
christ
walks
upon
the
deep
with
him
who
dares
the
rising
wave
and
though
his
failing
faith
grow
dim
finds
love
is
strong
to
save
knows
love
is
strong
to
save
and
lift
the
flagging
feet
that
fail
hearing
across
the
cloudy
drift
o
comrade
hail
who
sees
the
presence
finds
the
face
and
hears
the
mystic
word
who
moves
to
his
appointed
place
like
any
homing
bird
who
never
doubts
the
highest
peak
of
his
transcendent
hour
and
boldly
ventures
forth
to
seek
fulfilment
of
his
power
for
him
god
waits
beyond
the
sun
his
christ
of
many
scars
to
give
for
that
which
he
hath
done
a
heritage
of
stars
revelation
all
is
revealed
naught
is
concealed
sudden
and
swift
like
the
feet
of
the
spring
laughter
of
children
in
torrents
of
tears
breathing
of
blossoms
from
orchards
that
fling
perfumes
in
prodigal
scorn
of
the
years
empty
of
fruitage
like
the
touch
of
a
hand
soft
and
compassionate
known
in
the
deep
valley
of
death
like
the
flame
from
the
brand
flung
from
a
watchfire
to
frighten
and
keep
back
from
the
fold
the
striped
terror
that
stares
all
is
revealed
a
song
of
workers
hail
to
the
hodmen
the
builders
of
houses
hail
to
the
navvies
laying
pipes
for
pure
water
hail
to
the
miners
prisoned
in
pits
cleaving
the
coal
dauntless
of
death
from
the
gases
here
to
you
sailors
brave
on
the
boisterous
breast
of
the
ocean
tanned

you

of

a

you
will
not
do
this
thing
again
what
thing
mistake
of
owning
overmuch
great
palaces
and
princely
halls
gardens
of
babylon
that
hang
high
on
a
hill
created
at
the
cost
of
slaves
dead
by
the
thousands
that
some
queen
might
gaze
in
rapture
of
her

strange
how

stood
clothed
in

round

and
lone
and
ragged
with
no

to

to

rhythmic
clangour
of

comes
a
priest
back
from
the

pondering
the

law
blind
to
all
the
lovely
blossoms
in
the
awe
in
the
testamented
terror
of

lengthened
scroll

wanton
in

one
lone
cedar
straight
and
tall
he
stands
within
the
high
priest
hall
his
hands
are
bound
his
breast
is
bare
there
is
no
pity
anywhere
his
eyes
are
dim

at
him

there
stands
one
who
is
stretching
forth
his
hands
three
times
has
he
his
friend
denied
who
must
this
day
be
crucified
those
eyes
so
dim
have
looked
at
him
and
he
who
thrice
denied
and
swore

running
blindly
to
the
door

the
silver

coming
on
a
star

over
bethlehem
a
breath
of
buds
is
in
the
air
the
feet
of
spring
are
on
the
stair
descending
to
her
from
winter
palace
and
her
dress
is
wrought
with
flowers
of
summer
showers
a
tear
of
woe
is
in

eye

mourns
that
mary

never

again
the
touch
of
jesu
feet
o
nazareth
this
day
the
death
of
him
who
loved
you
is
your
loss
i
call
this
to
you
from
his
cross
the
stream
how
many
christs
have
we
two
crucified
how
many
prophets
have
we
sawn
asunder
what
wild
woe
have
we
wrought
how
deep
how
wide
the
wrong
committed
in
the
sky
god
thunder
threatens
his
lightning
cleaves
the
clouds
apart
to
show
an
awful
face
the
judge
is
in
his
place
of
judgment
oh
the
love
that
we
have
lost
above
beneath
and
all
around
us
sounds
the
cry
of
rachel
weeping
over
little
hands
and
little
feet
her
babes
are
dead
you
i
alone
are
guilty
for
while
error
stands
must
all
the
starry
christs
be
crucified
nay
do
not
hang
your
head
though
christs
be
crucified
and
rachel
babes
are
dead
one
river
floweth
wide
out
of
the
urge
of
god
of
that
eternal
stream
its
broad
with
vision
and
with
dream
are
you
comrade
and
i
yea
all
its
ancient
shores
that
river
runneth
by
have
we
touched
where
it
pours
past
leagues
of
jungles
and
miry
places
palms
of
an
unknown
land
ferns
and
their
fronded
faces
have
we
gone
forth
from
god
where
slimy
serpents
crawl
and
crocodiles
are
torpid
in
the
sun
where
snarling
tigers
sprawl
and
elephants
come
slowly
one
by
one
down
the
yellow
ridges
of
the
banyan
broken
bridges
to
the
river
where
the
little
shells
are
strawed
where
chattering
monkeys
leap
and
the
flamingo
struts
among
the
reeds
where
parrots
pause
and
peep
and
all
day
long
the
greedy
ibis
feeds
we
went
flowing
flowing
and
eternally
from
the
impulse
of
the
mighty
love
of
god
lift
up
your
head
o
my
brother
my
friend
know
that
your
shame
is
the
shame
of
the
stream
memory
floods
all
its
banks
but
the
end
what
is
the
end
is
a
realized
dream
dreamt
in
the
depths
of
an
infinite
peace
ere
the
first
star
of
the
morning
arose
over
the
earth
since
that
river
release
from
the
pure
spring
how
it
flows
how
it
flows
bears
on
its
bosom
the
sorrows
of
man
sin
and
the
wreckage
of
faith
and
of
truth
lust
and
hot
murder
the
primitive
ban
eye
for
an
eye
and
a
tooth
for
a
tooth
yet
that
same
bosom
babe
moses
did
bare
safe
in
his
cradle
of
wattles
its
tide
floated
the
tree
on
which
christ
crucified
bled
for
his
love
of
the
stream
and
his
share
of
the
past
lift
up
your
head
and
endure
are
we
not
part
of
the
all
and
as
pure
the
one
oblation
god
does
not
need
your
virtue
proclaimed
in
any
place
who
knows
a
better
beauty
than
such
a
pious
face
the
stars
keep
his
commandments
the
suns
observe
his
law
and
all
the
countless
comets
bow
down
to
him
in
awe
god
does
not
want
your
temples
whose
domes
are
in
the
sky
with
archangelic
anthems
how
dare
we
mortals
vie
one
thing
alone
my
brothers
rivals
that
bliss
above
not
incense
on
an
altar
but
man
oblation
love
a
question
have
you
christ
found
whose
eyes
are
cold
and
lips
are
set
how
you
forget
that
day
of
old
when
on
the
ground
he
wrote
one
tender
word
let
him
who
has
not
erred
be
first
of
these
alone
to
cast
a
stone
combatants
my
god
and
i
met
at
the
ford
lightning
of
wrath
was
on
his
face
and
in
his
hand
he
held
a
sword
he
whom
of
old
i
had
adored
now
challenged
me
i
paused
a
space
my
god
and
i
met
at
the
ford
dauntless
i
stood
and
daring
poured
hot
words
of
anger
stepped
one
pace
and
in
my
hand
i
held
a
sword
steel
clashed
on
steel
together
warred
comrades
of
old
in
that
fell
place
my
god
and
i
met
at
the
ford
one
moment
thrust
and
he
had
scored
i
of
his
mercy
pleaded
grace
god
smiled
on
me
and
dropped
his
sword
on
the
wide
white
road
question
minstrel
with
a
song
on
the
wide
white
road
loafing
with
the
lilies
of
the
june
what
makes
you
so
strong
underneath
your
load
lilting
such
a
joyous
little
tune
tell
me
little
brother
what
i
want
to
know
why
your
lips
are
tremulous
with
joy
why
you
like
a
mother
soothe
and
love
me
so
as
she
used
to
when
i
was
a
boy
all
the
way
behind
fades
into
a
dream
hideous
with
faces
in
the
gloom
blind
with
a
lurid
gleam
glowing
from
of
doom
answer
comrade
i
will
tell
you
how
i
laugh
and
sing
loafing
with
the
lilies
by
the
way
comrade
what
befell
you
that
you
missed
the
king
crowned
with
purple
pansies
of
the
day
brother
him
i
know
lord
of
earth
and
star
find
him
with
the
ferns
beside
the
pool
all
the
splendours
grow
dim
and
fade
afar
when
he
walks
at
shut
of
day
and
cool
fear
not
to
address
him
he
lonely
for
the
love
he
wants
from
you
up
at
once
and
bless
him
lift
a
jubilee
with
the
host
of
loyal
hearts
and
true
that
one
should
love
me
that
one
should
love
me
is
enough
be
my
path
smooth
or
be
it
rough
though
on
my
head
no
splendours
shine
love
crowns
me
with
the
if
on
my
ears
no
plaudits
fall
proclaiming
me
from
stall
to
stall
behind
the
scenes
i
wait
my
turn
who
saw
two
eyes
with
longing
burn
somewhere
within
that
audience
gleamed
golden
love
magnificence
i
stood
triumphant
for
a
space
held
by
the
rapture
on
one
face
out
of
the
discord
of
hark
how
the
play
peace
o
my
soul
one
song
is
true
though
conceal
the
blue
down
in
the
lowest
deep
of
hell
one
word
of
love
upon
me
fell
forthwith
my
face
was
bold
uplifted
to
a
gate
of
gold
upon
my
path
a
phantom
form
threatened
with
terror
as
of
storm
smote
me
with
lightning
i
was
strong
hearing
the
cadence
of
a
song
a
while
within
an
awful
wood
uncertain
of
the
path
i
stood
a
shout
of
laughter
from
a
tree
where
lurked
a
devil
frightened
me
then
there
was
whispering
of
leaves
soft
as
of
swallows
under
eaves
i
love
you
love
you
lo
a
light
sundered
the
murkiness
of
night
three
times
i
fell
three
times
i
rose
to
face
the
menacing
of
foes
what
gave
me
strength
again
to
stand
out
of
the
dark
i
felt
a
hand
out
of
the
dark
and
dread
of
death
upon
my
brow
i
felt
a
breath
and
by
the
brink
of
that
abyss
the
consolation
of
a
kiss
past
many
moors
of
pain
i
trod
impeded
by
the
clinging
clod
until
within
one
waking
morn
love
in
response
to
love
was
born
love
in
response
to
love
was
mine
the
was
filled
with
wine
the
broken
cruse
again
restored
and
green
had
grown
the
withered
gourd
rahab
rahab
hath
vermilion
lips
breasts
of
ivory
and
her
hips
taper
down
to
little
feet
that
go
dancing
on
the
street
gossips
call
dear
rahab
bold
say
her
love
is
bought
for
gold
barters
kisses
for
a
purse
well
some
women
have
done
worse
saw
you
ever
rahab
eyes
all
the
blue
of
canaan
skies
smiles
a
moment
and
you
see
beauty
best
in
galilee
heard
you
ever
rahab
song
you
would
murmur
surely
wrong
lives
not
in
that
lovely
voice
i
with
rahab
will
rejoice
i
came
up
the
winding
way
through
the
vines
at
shut
of
day
out
of
orphir
bearing
balms
and
i
saw
among
the
palms
rahab
wistful
by
the
wall
she
was
slender
she
was
tall
and
i
trembled
as
her
eyes
turned
on
me
in
swift
surprise
tyrian
purple
was
her
gown
gold
her
girdle
and
a
crown
made
of
myrtle
held
her
hair
oval
on
her
forehead
fair
little
sandals
shod
her
feet
rahab
smiling
murmured
greet
you
my
brother
are
you
come
laden
with
sweet
spice
and
gum
out
of
orphir
and
i
said
rahab
all
the
evening
shed
light
and
perfume
on
her
face
turned
to
me
i
paused
a
space
breathless
nothing
i
could
say
but
her
name
a
dear
dismay
of
her
beauty
made
me
mute
like
a
stringless
harp
or
lute
then
she
laughed
at
me
and
flung
high
her
hands
she
tipped
her
tongue
saucily
and
danced
along
feet
in
fellowship
with
song
i
pursued
her
through
the
vines
growing
where
the
bank
confines
jordan
followed
her
until
i
forgot
my
master
will
master
of
the
caravan
out
of
orphir
as
i
ran
love
arose
and
went
with
me
through
the
grapes
of
galilee
little
leaves
laughed
as
i
sped
after
rahab
overhead
two
white
doves
were
on
the
wing
and
i
heard
a
throstle
sing
where
my
feet
fell
on
the
brown
furrowed
vineyard
shaken
down
by
her
body
from
the
vine
grapes
were
crushed
to
make
me
wine
day
was
gazing
from
the
west
on
high
hermon
with
confessed
love
of
her
whose
ample
brow
crimsoned
and
from
every
bough
twilight
twitterings
were
heard
how
my
pulses
leaped
and
stirred
wild
with
longing
for
her
lips
like
two
red
pomegranate
pips
i
stretched
forth
my
hands
and
cried
rahab
and
she
turned
aside
from
the
vineyard
where
a
wood
near
a
purple
stood
there
she
paused
and
looked
on
me
laughing
boy
what
do
you
see
in
my
eyes
you
tremble
so
fate
i
answered
could
you
know
rahab
what
is
in
my
heart
you
would
pity
you
would
part
with
one
kiss
and
one
caress
here
beside
the
purple
press
boy
she
murmured
gossips
say
rahab
poisoned
lips
will
slay
whom
she
kisses
that
her
breasts
are
two
hidden
adders
nests
though
i
die
upon
your
mouth
kiss
me
rahab
for
the
drouth
of
the
desert
makes
my
soul
empty
as
an
empty
bowl
dreary
days
of
journeying
where
the
sands
go
billowing
miles
and
miles
beneath
the
sun
leave
me
broken
and
undone
all
my
youth
was
in
the
sere
dim
the
eye
and
deaf
the
ear
unto
beauty
until
now
rahab
harken
to
my
vow
give
me
vision
give
me
sense
of
lost
beauty
immanence
give
me
these
and
i
will
pay
careless
of
what
gossips
say
all
you
ask
in
turn
for
this
soul
of
you
within
one
kiss
rahab
eyes
were
suddenly
misted
over
and
to
me
came
her
whisper
o
my
heart
take
the
minstrel
gift
his
art
with
my
lips
on
yours
the
price
be
your
spirit
sacrifice
pain
of
vision
you
shall
know
summits
of
eternal
snow
depths
of
fire
you
shall
be
torn
twixt
the
twilight
and
the
morn
by
strange
dreams
of
bending
from
their
starry
places
blent
with
devils
out
of
hell
rahab
kissed
me
lo
there
fell
veils
of
violet
and
gold
from
the
sunset
fold
on
fold
till
the
tangled
vines
were
caught
and
with
mist
the
fields
were
fraught
notes
that
i
had
never
heard
in
the
tall
bulrushes
stirred
trembled
from
the
swaying
trees
fluting
strange
wild
melodies
rahab
kiss
and
tender
glance
taught
me
earth
significance
opened
wide
eternal
doors
where
the
flood
of
beauty
pours
out
of
heaven
out
of
god
quickening
the
stone
and
clod
leaf
and
shrub
and
bird
and
beast
for
the

sleepless
when
her
altar
lights
burn
through
balmy
summer
nights
wakeful
when
upon
the
day
pours
the
pollen

alway
rahab
kissed
me
by
the
press
bound
me
with
dear
love

and
clapped
her
hands
in
glee

the

me
and

to

upon

down

the
clod

breaking
things

not
what
they
seem
and
sorrow
comes
with
waking
i
yearn
to
hold
you

my
dream
but
then
comes
waking
the
silver
moment
past
and

the
sad

dear
heart
is
breaking
the
violet

the
violet

on

day
your
colour

to
the
violet
what
shall
the
dowry
be
and
what
my
stated
fortune
if
i
should
marry
thee
your
fortune
sang
the
violet
the
fragrance
of
my
breath
the
aster
swayed
and
murmured
i
will
be
yours
till
death
magic
there
is
magic
on
the
meadow
and
a
witch
has
won
the
wood
elfin
laughter
from
the
water
as
it
rolls
a
rhythmic
flood
for
a
spirit
meets
my
spirit
with
a
flash
of
and
all
the
world
a
garden
glad
with
many
blossomings
the
king
and
the
maid
o
love
cried
the
king
on
a
day
in
spring
as
he
went
through
the
leafy
wood
i
must
be
away
to
the
court
this
day
and
he
threw
back
the
purple
hood
from
his
royal
brow
that
was
paling
now
with
the
pain
of
the
parting
hour
for
the
maid
was
dear
and
her
lips
were
near
to
his
lips
like
a
crimson
flower
i
shall
be
alone
on
a
gilded
throne
in
the
midst
of
my
nobles
all
from
my
diadem
to
my
garment
hem
i
shall
ache
for
your
light
footfall
is
no
little
thing
dear
to
be
a
king
with
love
of
a
man
for
a
maid
and
to
play
the
part
with
an
empty
heart
like
a
scabbard
without
its
blade
but
the
maid
was
wise
and
her
hazel
eyes
were
brave
with
the
light
of
her
love
god
save
thee
my
king
from
great
suffering
grant
thee
of
his
grace
from
above
canst
thou
play
thy
part
with
an
empty
heart
if
i
fill
it
full
to
the
brim
of
the
wine
of
prayer
from
the
bowl
i
bear
and
his
eyes
with
the
tears
were
dim
on
that
ivory
throne
shalt
thou
be
alone
if
my
thoughts
are
to
thee
if
upon
thy
brow
that
is
paling
now
my
lips
mark
where
the
crown
shall
be
so
the
king
rode
south
from
her
crimson
mouth
through
the
forest
field
and
the
fells
and
his
voice
was
strong
with
words
of
a
song
to
a
chime
of
the
a
woman
prayer
god
of
the
heaven
and
earth
bring
to
the
birth
soul
of
the
man
that
i
love
from
the
above
send
him
the
light
of
thy
face
grant
to
him
grace
brave
in
the
battle
his
shield
never
to
yield
god
of
the
zephyr
and
gale
that
is
a
nail
holding
the
hand
of
my
dream
hard
to
the
beam
god
of
the
good
paraclete
both
of
his
feet
bleed
while
the
sentinels
toss
dice
near
a
cross
god
of
the
magic
of
morn
crimsoning
thorn
crowns
him
oh
hark
to
his
cry
sabachthani
god
of
the
laughter
and
tear
that
is
a
spear
stained
with
the
red
drops
that
start
under
his
heart
god
of
the
glamour
and
gloom
into
the
tomb
low
is
he
laid
see
a
stone
leaves
me
alone
god
of
the
lily
and
vine
is
he
not
mine
balms
for
his
body
i
bear
myrrh
for
his
hair
love
who
rolled
the
stone
away
bright
as
the
day
shineth
thy
brow
and
thy
face
gleams
with
a
grace
caught
from
the
whispering
wings
of
one
who
sings
there
is
no
death
lo
the
tomb
breaks
into
bloom
god
of
a
woman
wide
love
under
above
over
the
earth
there
is
light
sprung
from
the
night
now
is
the
heart
of
me
filled
soul
of
me
stilled
glad
of
thy
shepherding
care
answering
prayer
foeman
i
stand
with
drawn
sword
in
my
hand
to
face
you
for
a
space
you
you
comrade
can
this
be
true
that
i
must
yield
or
die
those
eyes
gray
like
november
skies
i
feel
sharper
than
steel
one
word
before
sword
clash
on
sword
and
stern
wrath
in
us
burn
recall
the
swift
footfall
and
mirth
when
the
awakened
earth
grew
glad
of
what
we
had
love
life
not
this
tremendous
strife
petals
were
shed
with
bloom
of
lilies
in
that
room
where
we
stood
silently
and
heard
stirred
on
chords
by
minstrel
lords
whose
wings
moved
to
the
strings
why
why
dared
we
to
try
to
prove
our
love
wrong
wrong
when
we
knew
song
and
light
and
so
now
with
paling
brow
and
set
hard
lips
we
two
are
met
to
kill
ah
would
your
will
make
mine
as
grapes
bruised
for
the
wine
seek
you
to
run
me
through
i
take
my
sword
and
break
the
blade
strike
i
have
made
of
it
a
cross
counting
that
loss
which
holds
me
from
your
the
sign
proves
me
forever
thine
proves
that
i
give
self
that
our
love
may
live
geraint
open
dear
lady
the
little
red
door
the
little
red
door
to
me
night
is
all
cold
and
my
feet
are
sore
i
have
made
a
long
journey
leagues
have
i
travelled
the
mountains
crossed
eager
for
love
of
thee
lady
i
fear
that
thy
love
is
lost
open
thy
heart
to
me
open
thy
heart
and
i
will
go
in
the
red
door
silently
there
i
shall
find
what
i
seek
to
win
dear
lady
thy
love
for
me
grief
my
heart
is
pain
my
spirit
dearth
tears
are
the
rain
upon
the
earth
and
all
the
sky
is
not
more
darkened
than
am
i
a
while
ago
i
watched
the
snow
and
laughed
to
see
its
witchery
now
that
your
face
is
turned
away
winter
white
magic
melts
from
day
the
casement
wide
this
wan
yuletide
i
opened
heard
one
little
bird
on
a
crystalled
bough
but
he
will
pipe
no
longer
now
for
when
he
saw
the
stricken
awe
upon
my
face
he
left
his
place
and
winged
into
the
upper
air
my
visaged
grief
he
could
not
bear
a
little
child
by
me
beguiled
but
yesterday
from
busy
play
this
morning
hurried
from
these
eyes
he
could
not
look
where
courage
dies
under
the
sun
two
selves
are
one
sorrow
and
i
oh
let
me
die
and
never
meet
the
month
of
may
now
that
your
face
is
turned
away
the
empty
room
out
of
the
storm
i
hurry
in
to
find
an
empty
room
i
call
and
call
but
no
footfall
answers
across
the
room
vainly
your
eyes
i
seek
to
win
you
are
not
here
o
dear
my
dear
there
is
no
sound
and
stir
of
you
i
know
not
what
to
do
i
know
not
what
to
do
or
say
i
stand
with
vacant
stare
upon
the
brink
of
pain
to
think
love
whither
dost
thou
fare
an
echo
answers
gone
away
your
roses
red
their
petals
shed
upon
the
book
of
verse
i
gave
like
tears
down
on
a
grave
love
eternal
let
us
walk
together
lass
lean
upon
me
so
through
the
field
of
feathergrass
how
the
daisies
grow
till
we
find
the
word
to
say
what
is
in
our
hearts
yes
i
loved
you
from
the
first
dear
there
is
surprise
blent
with
hunger
and
with
thirst
in
your
eager
eyes
and
you
whisper
is
it
true
knowing
that
i
always
knew
let
me
tell
you
how
it
came
voices
through
the
room
then
one
spoke
to
me
your
name
take
this
wild
rose
bloom
i
will
place
it
in
your
hair
and
of
you
i
was
aware
she
is
of
a
slender
grace
like
my
maid
of
dreams
to
myself
i
said
her
face
with
that
beauty
gleams
beauty
of
that
one
i
know
in
the
land
of
did
you
dearest
understand
why
the
scarlet
grew
on
my
forehead
when
my
hand
your
fair
fingers
knew
oh
the
world
went
very
still
while
on
me
you
worked
your
will
worked
your
will
do
not
deny
for
your
heart
was
wise
ah
you
shake
your
head
and
try
vainly
to
disguise
what
was
on
your
lips
to
say
when
we
met
that
fateful
day
for
from
all
eternity
we
are
pledged
to
love
bound
in
all
our
lives
to
be
true
to
what
above
all
the
turmoil
and
the
din
strives
that
starry
tryst
to
win
sit
with
me
upon
this
stone
underneath
the
bough
let
the
blossoms
to
us
blown
learn
our
ancient
vow
vow
we
made
before
the
stars
strove
to
break
night
lift
your
head
and
meet
my
gaze
do
you
not
recall
somewhere
in
a
golden
haze
vistaed
vast
a
hall
paved
with
diamond
and
domed
blue
above
a
fount
that
foamed
with
the
water
from
the
well
guarded
so
they
say
by
the
angel
israfel
water
of
eternal
bliss
sprinkled
on
the
lips
that
kiss
there
we
lived
before
the
suns
led
the
planets
up
there
we
pledged
the
winged
ones
in
a
crystal
cup
ere
we
left
that
pillared
home
through
the
field
of
time
to
roam
why
you
ask
me
dearest
why
did
we
leave
that
place
is
it
such
a
thing
to
die
ponder
for
a
space
what
if
love
must
lose
to
gain
find
eternal
peace
in
pain
but
i
want
the
dear
do
you
not
know
they
who
drive
the
patient
plough
and
the
furrows
sow
own
the
sinews
of
the
strong
reap
the
harvest
with
a
song
let
the
scattered
fragments
be
gathered
from
the
feast
nothing
lost
thus
speaketh
he
who
is
love
high
priest
and
he
knows
who
from
a
cross
pledged
return
for
every
loss
thus
my
maid
of
long
ago
here
within
the
field
let
me
tell
what
you
would
know
how
i
came
to
yield
to
your
eyes
your
lips
your
hair
when
the
guests
were
gathered
there
in
the
room
that
day
we
met
found
amid
the
talk
light
of
ancient
suns
which
set
æons
ere
the
chalk
cliffs
of
dover
gleamed
upon
from
babylon
love
and
life
eternal
are
fill
unfathomed
space
bind
with
rapture
star
to
star
gleam
from
every
face
soar
with
angels
plunge
to
hell
lucifer
and
israfel
so
above
the
choric
spheres
at
the
knees
of
god
you
and
i
beyond
the
years
kissed
then
clove
the
clod
with
our
spirit
sundered
flame
till
amid
the
talk
your
name
fell
seraphic
smote
me
through
with
unearthly
pain
i
was
i
and
you
were
you
met
on
earth
again
bound
to
live
and
bound
to
love
by
that
oath
we
made
above
after
the
feast
i
have
drunk
deeply
of
the
cup
fared
well
and
fed
the
guests
with
whom
i
sat
to
sup
are
gone
to
bed
a
broken
harp
lies
on
the
floor
its
tangled
strings
will
sound
no
more
the
linen
i
deplore
here
is
a
little
trampled
rose
a
violet
here
is
a
hyacinth
and
those
are
mignonette
they
looked
so
proudly
from
their
place
first
at
the
feast
with
tears
i
trace
now
but
a
vestige
of
that
grace
upon
the
table
is
a
crown
where
is
the
king
the
little
leaves
that
tremble
down
cover
a
ring
a
vase
of
crystal
shattered
lies
against
a
goblet
where
the
wise
talked
through
the
laughter
how
time
flies
it
is
not
very
long
ago
here
in
the
hall
when
to
the
tapers
tangled
glow
the
rise
and
fall
of
voices
over
nuts
and
wine
murmured
like
wind
through
leaf
and
vine
and
there
was
joy
of
me
and
mine
i
snuff
the
tapers
one
by
one
the
darkness
falls
alas
for
feasting
and
for
fun
my
madrigals
are
ended
i
will
not
again
sing
sound
of
wind
and
weeping
rain
is
now
the
interlude
of
pain
yet
it
was
good
to
know
the
feast
to
be
a
guest
though
at
the
table
i
was
least
among
the
best
blindly
i
grope
unto
the
door
gather
a
flower
from
the
floor
i
will
come
back
here
never
more
what
never
more
go
gladly
back
ah
foolish
me
when
down
the
winding
starry
track
the
company
with
laughter
their
lord
following
shall
yet
return
to
greet
the
king
who
claims
the
crown
and
wears
the
ring
and
though
i
have
put
out
each
light
gathered
one
flower
bravely
i
fare
forth
into
night
what
is
an
hour
a
day
a
year
if
after
all
the
silence
those
dear
comrades
call
and
there
is
harping
in
the
hall
i
wait
the
summons
gladly
go
against
the
rain
they
will
be
seated
row
on
row
here
once
again
and
in
that
brave
loved
company
what
song
and
laughter
there
will
be
when
i
resume
my
minstrelsy
the
lonely
road
o
will
you
take
the
lonely
road
the
upward
road
among
the
many
stars
its
pavement
is
by
pain
bestowed
your
feet
shall
find
the
scars
your
feet
shall
know
the
scars
my
friend
it
is
a
path
without
a
bend
it
leadeth
not
by
pastures
green
through
meadows
green
nor
near
the
little
hills
gaunt
granite
cliffs
it
runs
between
dark
fear
that
chaos
fills
with
cloud
and
storm
and
shadowings
of
vigilant
unfolded
wings
it
windeth
not
along
the
streams
the
laughing
streams
it
leadeth
straight
and
far
beyond
the
mirrored
pool
of
dreams
in
peril
to
a
star
who
comes
this
way
must
go
alone
steadfast
and
strong
nor
making
moan
it
is
the
path
called
perilous
named
perilous
the
path
that
heroes
tread
who
hear
the
cry
o
come
with
us
brave
voices
of
the
dead
for
they
are
compassed
by
a
throng
of
harpers
harping
to
a
song
follow
afar
past
cliff
and
scar
finding
your
star
brave
in
the
night
up
to
the
light
proving
your
might
though
the
foot
fail
and
the
heart
wail
though
the
brow
pale
follow
afar
where
the
gods
are
finding
your
star
along
this
way
lord
jesu
went
christ
jesu
went
hither
came
socrates
and
all
who
were
with
tears
forspent
the
shining
companies
of
those
who
lifted
high
the
heart
beyond
the
lure
of
any
mart
and
would
you
fare
this
lonely
way
this
starry
way
take
but
a
scrip
and
staff
with
sandals
for
your
feet
though
fools
in
folly
laugh
deriding
that
you
leave
the
less
their
idle
dream
of
happiness
if
you
would
find
the
way
of
wings
wings
that
lift
one
to
a
star
you
must
be
free
from
hamperings
of
lock
and
bolt
and
bar
cast
care
of
gold
and
silk
aside
with
pomp
of
place
and
rank
and
pride
if
on
your
path
there
be
a
cross
a
wayside
cross
with
nails
and
sponge
and
spear
a
gambling
guard
who
turn
to
toss
dice
for
the
robe
you
wear
avoid
not
that
appointed
place
though
thorns
with
crimson
stain
your
face
but
if
you
take
this
road
my
friend
my
wistful
friend
your
world
will
wake
to
song
and
all
high
holy
angels
bend
to
hail
you
of
their
throng
and
where
the
sons
eternal
are
you
shall
be
throned
upon
your
star
