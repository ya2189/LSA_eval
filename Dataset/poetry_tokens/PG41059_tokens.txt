morning
of

there
came
the
spirit
singing
such
entrancing
notes
as
sweeps
the
whole
empyrian
with
a
flame
wherein
a
dream
pure

as

as

old
of
virgin
art
within
a
golden
mold
still
burning
molten
shaping
unto
glory
a
matchless
song
and
yet
a
simple
story
how
mischief
led
a
cold
unwitting
boy
along
new
paths
to
taste
a
sudden
joy
how
curious
love
asport
from
flower
to
flower
hath
found
a
sense
too
sweet
to
overpower
and
yet
such
magic
sweet
that

the
fairest

of
any
cupid
heavenly
born
fair
son
of
beauty
queen
whom
to
adorn
needs
but
to
name
great
venus
queen
of
beauty
whom
to
adore
was
but
a
solemn
duty
this
lad
whom
she
hath
dowered
with
all
her
charms
a
voice
resistless
and
soft
amorous
arms
and
named
him
love
now
raptured
lies
a
simple
lover
in
a
woman
eyes
a
tale
of
heart
and
soul
and
so
of
sorrow

afterwhiles
when
riches
stoop
to
borrow
a
tale
of
being
subtlest
jewelry
grief
with
golden
filigree
and
i
would
soar
on
golden
wings
of
song
and
in
the

empyrian

along
from
height

height
of
all
the
heart
dear
chimes
to
bless
thee
for
the
love
that
thou
hast
brought
with
greater
life
let
tender
tinkling
rhimes
like
pure
white
doves
lead
on
the
lovely
thought
i
deep
in
a
woody
vale
where
crystal
streams
run
vaguely
like
the
threads
of
vanished
dreams
where
fountains
tinkle
to
the
yellow
sun
sweet
hopes
and
lightly
run
in
joyful
race
unto
the
distant
ocean
where
greeny
swards
are
checked
with
light
and
shade
to
make
a
cool
retreat
for
fine
emotion
and
velvet
lawns
than
never
weft
was
laid
more
intricate
designed
of
pleasing
hues
so
richly
gem
in
orient
pearls
of
dews
along
quaint
aisles
in
mosques
of
samarkand
to
bear
some
solemn
priest
in
deep
devotion
where
vague
far
vistas
stretch
on
every
hand
to
luring
scenes
where
happy
shepherds
amble
with
happy
maids
as
light
as
lambs
agambol
or
lie
alone
with
flocks
abrowse
by
streams
and
rear
quaint
misty
cities
out
of
dreams
along
far
clouds
of
pearly
shape
and
lining
in
crystal
walls
and
domes
of
no
defining
and
people
them
with
shepherds
maids
and
gods
that
live
for
love
until
the
shepherd
nods
and
dreams
of
his
own
phillis
fairer
far
upon
a
hillock
in
a
shady
grove
the
heart
of
this
fair
scene
its
central
star
and
viewless
as
the
stars
of
heaven
are
with
too
much
light
stood
once
the
house
of
love
a
mansion
builded
of
the
rarest
stone
transparent
gem
like
carved
and
strangely
wrought
as
some
fine
architecture
in
a
dream
is
sought
and
gird
with
fancy
fairest
flowers
blown
the
house
of
love
and
here
of
balmy
days
its
gentle
spirits
thrid
in
dreamy
maze
and
here
the
days
are
always
balmy
here
is
sweet
to
laugh
and
sweet
to
drop
a
tear
its
crystal
halls
in
magic
mirror
walls
stand
empty
but
for
one
while
myriad
falls
of
lover
feet
go
tripping
after
her
or
him
and
wild
faint
odors
sweetly
stir
through
all
the
room
from
raptured
lovers
breathing
while
each
a
rosy
crown
for
aye
is
wreathing
this
is
the
house
of
love
the
golden
key
is
faith
sweet
faith
in
joy
of
living
that
doubts
the
mirror
not
nor
cares
to
see
what
hidden
scenes
the
glass
is
loth
in
giving
ii
here
long
ago
so
runs
the
gentle
tale
sweet
psyche
wondrous
fair
and
pearly
pale
her
young
loves
virgin
brow
all
softly
tinting
with
far
faint
hues
of
waking
loves
first
hinting
and
all
enraptured
cupid
arm
in
arm
secluded
far
from
rude
eyes
loveless
harm
have
wiled
through
many
a
long
and
gracious
hour
like
fair
twin
bees
within
a
fragrant
flower
such
love
as
they
have
sipt
such
silent
bliss
of
raptured
bosoms
welded
with
a
kiss
such
kisses
lavished
rich
and
juicy
ripe
such
glorious
songs
as
only
lovers
pipe
from
morn
to
morn
the
lover
boundless
season
unvext
with
chilly
thought
or
chilled
with
reason
ah
love
thou
art
a
happy
reckless
boy
to
measure
ages
with
a
moments
joy
adown
the
streams
of
golden
waterfalls
on
hidden
rocks
the
white
faced
lurley

rash
wilful
cupid
recks
without
the
cost
if
venus
favor
not
then
all
is
lost
afar
he
flies
unto
her
royal
throne
to
claim
the
boon
of
joys
that
he
would
own
and
bring
unto
the
mount
his
glorious
bride
immortal
thence
forever
by
his
side
but
venus
queen
of
beauty
waxes
wrath
to
find
new
beauty
cross
her
royal
path
and
shall
this
son
of
all
her
royal
favor
bind
to
a
watery
chit
of
mortal
flavor
not
so
a
mother
newest
plans
are
older
than
any
fancy
scheme
of
youthful
molder
his
fate
is
hers
to
mold
then
hie
away
to

but
think
no
more
to
disobey
old
mother
locksmith
venus
is
thy
name
of
myriad
escapades
all
back
to
thee
the
blame
the
angry
queen
hath
ruled
and
love
achaffing
at
wasted
time
hies
back
to
love
alaughing
and
he
hath
sworn
that
she
is
fairer
far
than
that
proud
goddess
of
the
morning
star
albeit
queen
of
beauty
here
in
mortal
line
our
tale
should
end
beneath
the
smile
parental
in
iris
tinted
shower
of
peace
divine
and
blessings
less
of
use
than
ornamental
iii
but
all
the
mount
hath
heard
this
reckless
oath
and
all
the
mount
aghast
if
venus
wroth
be
not
the
venus
terrible
alas
such
lovers
make
sad
flowers
in
the
grass
and
woful
trees
by
many
a
dusky
stream
embar
the
fire
of
many
a
love
young
dream
and
grizzly
monsters
moan
in
sunken
path
some
fiery
love
that
stirred
the
gods
to
wrath
but
beauty
queen
hath
brooked
no
passing
jest
to
penetrate
her
deep
heart
wild
unrest
but
in
the
stilly
quiet
of
her
wrath
conceives
dark
pitfalls
for
the
lover
path
and
she
that
once
hath
hied
to
amorous
chase
and
grieved
outstript
in
love
immortal
race
now
calls
her
white
winged
swans
on
fleecy
pinions
to
bear
her
down
to
earthly
love
dominions
for
naught
of
love
or
sorrow
from
a
cave
whence
flowed
her
double
fountain
bitter
wave
two
serpents
green
and
gray
and
mottled
golden
within
her
chariots
hold
hath
she
close
folden
glittering
whispering
sibilant
deep
curses
old
they
with
their
fury
pant
to
strains
the
subtle
bonds
of
jealous
art
and
plant
deep
venomed
fangs
within
her
heart
but
now
the
feathry
chariot
glides
along
the
airy
sea
among
the
sable
throng
of
darkling
hours
whose
soundless
feet
are
gliding
unto
the
amorous
dome
of
love
abiding
and
they
have
halted
serpents
swans
and
queen
within
a
grove
that
shields
them
with
its
screen
of
interlacing
there
a
little
bloom
of
nameless
hue
and
forest
wild
perfume
she
plucks
and
crusheth
in
a
bowl
of
jade
and
with
her
breath
a
syrup
weird
hath
made
whose
faint
escaping
break
along
dim
aisles
of
forests
brooding
mournful
eld
beguiles
till
such
a
wild
heart
rending
moan
hath
risen
as
never
rose
within
a
tortured
prison
to
greet
a
ray
of
light
but
not
she
bends
above
her
serpents
breathing
hot
upon
their
heads
een
as
they
pause
to
strike
this
mystic
lotion
lo
what
wonders
like
hath
ever
magic
seer
in
lore
beholden
each
serpent
skin
a
woman
form
enfolden
that
with
that
breath
of
drunken
magic
lotion
hath
sprung
to
being
with
an
exquisite
motion
and
such
sweet
words
as
through
a
thousand
years
have
gathered
music
for
a
tale
of
tears
but
lo
one
groweth
old
and
very
old
a
toothless
haggard
hideous
to
behold
and
one
hath
grown
a
marvellous
creature
of
luscious
form
and
speechless
worship
feature
one
stands
like
sunlight
on
a
crested
wave
and
one
like
murky
darkness
in
a
cave
but
each
a
low
obedient
knee
hath
bended
to
hear
the
queenly
will
thus
long
suspended
and
thus
the
queen
to
her
the
radiant
maiden
thou
bitter
sweet
thou
vessel
overladen
in
yonder
dome
a
fairer
maid
than
thou
sees
all
her
beauty
in
a
lover
vow
nor
heeds
the
ripples
on
that
mirror
sheen
from
troubled
depths
of
her
fair
self
unseen
go
thou
and
with
thine
ointed
tongue
reverse
the
mirror
face
and
there
thine
own
immerse
remembering
still
thou
hast
a
serpent
tongue
that
holds
thee
slave
till
thou
hast
surely
flung
its
glittering
barb
into
that
silly
heart
then
like
an
apparition
of
a
dream
the
maid
hath
vanished
with
a
hellish
gleam
and
thus
the
queen
unto
that
gruesome
hag
in
yonder
dome
a
youth
hath
founden
beauty
within
a
maid
and
swears
all
foul
and
sooty
that
is
not
there
thou
hast
a
serpent
eyes
and
seeth
so
what
dreary
falsehood
lies
in
such
a
mirror
go
reverse
the
glass
and
thine
the
beauty
he
has
wasted
on
the
lass
he
hath
not
seen
the
hory
dame
is
gone
and
venus
left
within
the
grove
alone
recalls
her
swans
and
mounts
the
starry
air
then
she
the
new
born
maid
as
false
as
fair
hath
found
sweet
psyche
in
the
crystal
dome
and
creeping
like
a
mad
thing
to
her
soul
in
friendly
guise
exacts
a
hideous
toll
for
all
her
blissful
life
how
can
she
bind
her
sunny
soul
to
such
a
treacherous
mind
and
she
hath
wed
a
libertine
a
rake
whom
even
now
her
pleasures
must
forsake
to
drink
new
pleasures
with
another
bride
and
if
she
creeps
in
silence
to
his
side
forsooth
unwelcome
sights
might
come
unto
her
with
such
foul
words
the
fiend
began
to
woo
her
and
in
her
pearly
ear
hath
poured
the
breath
of
hideous
doubt
that
stabs
her
soul
to
death
and
then
hath
wandered
with
exultant
heart
unto
the
vales
of
crete
her
glittering
dart
of
barbed
tongue
a
woman
sweetness
singing
and
ever
more
hath
myriad
minions
clinging
unto
her
heartless
laughter
but
no
more
to
grace
our
tale
and
now
the
haggard
hoar
on
cupid
angry
ears
with
whisperings
of
faithless
women
and
the
direful
springs
of
wasted
lives
and
she
hath
heard
the
wind
sing
always
maids
are
false
and
men
are
blind
and
in
a
cavern
by
the
ocean
side
is
daily
jest
of
wind
and
sun
and
tide
how
psyche
tweaks
the
gentle
cupid
nose
between
the
beds
and
psyche
false
as
fair
needs
but
a
whim
to
lay
her
treason
bare
this
very
night
if
he
will
but
deny
her
if
nothing
more
at
least
time
to
try
her
for
sooth
unwelcome
sights
might
come
unto
him
with
such
foul
words
the
witch
began
to
woo
him
and
in
his
angry
ears
hath
poured
the
bane
that
sets
his
heart
at
riot
in
his
brain
iv
what
wonder
then
if
in
the
lonely
night
sweet
psyche
weeps
to
find
her
love
is
slighted
feels
darkness
fall
upon
her
trembling
light
and
throws
to
wind
the
vows
her
love
has
plighted
and
she
hath
risen
from
her
loveless
bed
with
all
the
stealth
her
grief
supplies
instead
and
steals
to
cupid
fine
unguarded
room
where
she
must
feast
her
heart
on
deeper
gloom
here
cupid
airy
souled
hath
asleep
too
filled
of
love
such
watch
for
long
to
keep
and
even
now
with
her
in
blissful
dreams
he
roams
again
and
all
the
future
seems
as
sweets
of
old
no
little
pains
of
doubt
to
mar
recalling
moments
with
their
rout
all
through
the
halls
such
joy
of
living
blent
her
soul
and
his
in
single
ravishment
and
oh
they
wander
in
the
vale
all
through
the
dewy
morn
and
evening
pale
and
each
to
drink
the
other
loveliness
despising
richest
nectar
even
the
stress
of
queenly
anger
now
had
bode
its
time
and
fresh
aurora
speeding
to
this
clime
hath
venus
royal
word
to
grant
his
prayer
that
with
the
dawn
to
clasp
his
psyche
there
in
perfect
love
with
all
the
world
their
own
ah
promised
day
his
eager
soul
hath
flown
to
meet
the
morning
on
his
lonely
bed
reclines
his
happy
visionary
head
in
such
sweet
dreams
an
hour
hath
lightly
flown
when
his
senses
steals
a
softened
moan
as
when
a
soul
all
pent
and
warp
in
gloom
hath
breathed
soul
deep
some
sudden
wild
perfume
that
is
of
freedom
awaked
to
such
surprise
he
sees
with
heart
aghast
the
famished
eyes
of
psyche
filling
to
their
very
brim
with
his
forbidden
beauty
sees
for
him
the
golden
future
vanish
sees
aghast
for
now
he
knows
his
lovely
dream
hath
passed
that
soulless
doubt
hath
razed
the
golden
dome
of
his
high
hopes
to
desert
sandy
loam
the
structured
palace
falls
with
all
its
art
to
grieve
a
valley
with
an
aching
heart
from
out
a
darkened
corner
of
the
ruin
rises
and
laughs
to
view
the
dismal
crisis
that
baneful
hag
but
ah
what
beauty
fairer
what
luscious
form
arrayed
in
raiment
rarer
and
she
hath
flown
to
vales
of
thessaly
where
ever
more
her
mocking
eyes
shall
see
a
myriad
eyes
upon
her
beauty
glisten
a
myriad
ears
unto
her
rumor
listen
and
cupid
flees
in
sudden
wild
despair
to
drown
his
soul
within
the
bitter
fountain
nor
venus
now
may
crown
his
heart
laid
bare
nor
any
luscious
goddess
of
the
mountain
v
but
psyche
wanders
like
a
saddened
rill
thrust
from
a
jewelled
grotto
in
the
hill
to
perish
in
a
lonely
sandy
waste
and
all
forlorn
with
steps
that
can
not
haste
for
such
absorbing
grief
she
chides
his
heart
that
was
a
glittering
palace
now
a
part
of
ruined
things
she
writes
within
the
sand
some
resolution
high
her
grievous
heart
hath
planned
a
sign
to
mark
the
spot
some
time
some
how
a
charm
to
lead
her
back
again
and
now
a
little
shrine
within
a
lonely
place
which
vines
with
subtle
interlace
hath
reared
to
demeter
her
wearied
feet
have
found
and
all
her
soul
hath
flown
to
meet
her
prayer
happiness
it
is
a
bowl
of
crystal
dew
where
nature
paints
her
soul
and
psyche
now
a
gentle
worshipper
hath
bent
sad
prayerful
knees
and
pearly
ear
low
for
the
golden
oracle
sad
eyes
in
tangled
braid
of
smiles
and
tears
surprise
the
crystal
truth
lo
she
hath
seen
and
death
seems
struggling
for
her
weary
panting
breath
what
horrid
charm
of
circe
baneful
art
it
is
a
serpent
head
green
eyed
and
swart
with
lightning
flashes
of
a
forked
tongue
and
glittering
treachery
on
its
forehead
hung
oh
for
a
generous
draft
of
that
sweet
moly
to
bring
dear
psyche
back
as
pure
and
holy
as
when
a
maiden
in
her
jewel
palace
she
kissed
for
love
her
nectar
brimming
chalice
that
held
serene
a
limned
picture
there
of
wealth
of
beauty
framed
in
golden
hair
but
nature
shrine
guides
not
the
errant
feet
of
little
faith
and
sudden
prayers
all
unmeet
for
crippled
love
ah
where
the
happy
shrine
of
boundless
heart
and
still
a
tongue
divine
in
lover
oracles
with
holy
words
of
sweet
ablution
when
the
night
engirds
each
little
tear
when
never
a
smile
but
darkens
its
firefly
gloom
when
never
an
ear
that
hearkens
but
dulls
a
moan
and
never
a
scene
outspread
in
mirror
drops
but
darts
a
serpent
head
such
bitter
moan
she
made
such
bitter
moan
no
grieving
pan
on
bursting
reeds
alone
in
madness
ever
made
to
startled
streams
no
nightingale
her
saddest
tongueless
dreams
hath
sobbed
to
beauty
on
a
hidden
thorn
to
swoon
in
at
the
morn
but
soul
is
exquisite
the
flowers
essence
that
through
its
bruises
breathes
quintessence
and
all
the
suffering
of
the
dateless
world
its
rarest
gladdest
petals
hold
enfurled
this
is
the
soul
yet
all
its
world
a
thought
of
smiling
strands
and
sunlit
oceans
fraught
with
homing
argosies
and
waneless
suns
shine
on
its
passing
gonfalons
what
the
mask
its
keener
eyes
see
through
it
what
the
ban
its
laughter
will
undo
it
what
the
time
its
fleeting
thought
will
span
it
what
the
deed
its
ancient
hour
began
it
and
bruised
unfurl
the
leaf
the
bruise
is
gone
yet
heal
the
wound
the
essence
breathe
right
on
this
is
the
soul
but
psyche
grieves
an
hour
till
every
petal
in
the
spirit
flower
is
bruised
by
so
much
time
and
far
she
yet
hath
wandered
farther
like
a
star
of
aimless
race
in
melancholy
deeps
her
bittered
feet
have
struggled
on
the
steeps
her
moaning
soul
hath
crossed
the
stygian
river
and
she
hath
read
the
runes
of
never
never
in
wailing
spirits
of
the
sunless
moors
and
piteous
quagmires
seeking
piteous
shores
and
she
whose
mirror
was
a
drop
of
dew
when
golden
fancy
played
upon
her
ear
now
shrieks
where
horror
strikes
her
spirit
through
within
the
gloomy
region
of
a
tear
vi
but
one
that
she
hath
met
within
the
gloom
some
shadow
wearied
from
the
lake
of
doom
whom
she
remembers
for
her
ancient
self
hath
led
her
from
the
low
and
crumbling
shelf
that
hangs
upon
oblivion
bound
her
tresses
about
her
brow
with
old
times
fond
caresses
and
to
the
weeping
shade
of
beauty
fall
presents
a
little
curious
lachrimal
which
she
hath
wrought
with
many
quaint
enlaying
of
happy
times
and
tears
presents
it
saying
this
is
thy
beauty
bear
it
to
thy
love
and
ask
no
more
quick
to
the
light
above
thy
wings
must
bear
this
precious
charm
away
nor
pause
till
thou
deliverest
it
the
day
must
wane
not
on
thy
loveless
spirit
lorn
so
long
then
swifter
than
the
dainty
morn
she
flies
unto
her
love
and
all
agleam
her
beating
fancy
lives
her
future
dream
how
fair
how
fair
but
even
as
she
flies
the
curious
urn
must
tempt
her
famished
eyes
and
she
hath
paused
ah
woe
betide
the
lover
that
halts
to
dream
and
tempt
the
soul
to
steep
in
th
unrevealed
what
lethe
fumes
discover
in
such
unfathomed
deeps
of
death
or
sleep
vii
as
if
a
pearl
had
golden
wings
and
far
had
flown
to
purple
lurings
of
a
star
from
out
her
jewelled
grotto
still
to
seem
the
gladdest
spirit
of
a
precious
dream
and
fluttering
over
misty
mantled
hills
hath
fallen
wearied
where
her
beauty
fills
some
fair
recess
within
a
mossy
dingle
for
such
a
rest
and
lieth
all
amingle
with
gladdest
flowers
that
ever
quivered
through
to
kiss
so
sweet
and
strange
a
drop
of
dew
a
bit
of
beauty
ravishing
the
brain
unremembered
dream
touch
back
again
and
sketch
sweet
rainbows
on
the
raptured
soul
thus
gaining
her
spirits
golden
goal
hath
psyche
curious
psyche
fallen
asleep
her
jewelled
urn
in
bedded
mosses
deep
hath
aside
and
lieth
like
a
gem
of
goddess
lost
from
starry
anadem
and
here
the
sun
in
drinking
up
the
dew
hath
paused
to
find
an
ancient
thirst
renew
and
raptured
connoisseur
of
dewy
gems
would
woo
the
nymph
the
stony
silence
hems
but
on
her
pearly
cheek
his
amorous
kisses
fall
deadly
cold
and
all
is
warm
caresses
unheeded
lo
his
godly
art
of
change
he
fain
work
and
make
some
rare
and
strange
addition
to
the
old
immortal
throng
behold
within
the
raptured
skies
of
song
another
music
like
the
morning
star
poor
gentle
echo
wandering
far
here
finds
her
dear
narcissus
kissing
lips
as
sweet
as
hers
but
while
the
honey
drips
of
saddest
love
he
poureth
in
those
ears
meander
flowery
vale
a
happy
whisper
hears
narcissus
dear
narcissus
now
is
free
ah
sweet
to
sing
though
his
eyes
but
see
this
new
divine
and
pausing
on
her
wings
her
heart
is
free
with
old
remembered
things
poor
wronged
arachne
spins
a
golden
thread
from
oak
to
oak
and
hoping
wild
has
fled
along
such
path
with
such
a
beating
heart
to
catch
some
dream
that
hedged
her
olden
art
it
was
not
meet
in
such
an
artist
soul
should
lurk
a
spider
venom
nor
the
whole
of
godly
anger
lessens
this
a
bit
and
sad
arachne
on
her
beam
aflit
within
a
shower
of
hopes
her
soul
doth
steep
to
weave
ah
thus
to
weave
a
soul
asleep
and
zephyr
gathering
anemones
among
the
flower
beds
her
dear
form
sees
whom
he
of
late
in
scented
scarf
hath
borne
with
such
fond
care
and
over
seas
of
corn
of
emerald
depth
far
stretched
in
dreamy
waves
to
flowery
strands
where
happy
flora
laves
on
april
morns
he
calls
his
love
to
view
this
pearly
fancy
sleeping
in
the
dew
sweet
flora
goddess
of
the
scented
hours
hath
woven
a
dainty
wreath
of
april
flowers
the
bloom
she
gathers
for
the
scent
in
maiden
april
lap
of
wonderment
a
little
wreath
round
head
and
feet
and
wing
for
to
call
a
fairy
ring
where
those
enamored
blooms
must
dance
for
breezy
joy
about
a
soul
in
trance
viii
now
wing
apollo
golden
strings
hath
wandered
far
in
his
dear
ponderings
and
fashioned
such
a
music
wild
and
free
as
wakes
to
love
the
cold
anemone
and
saddened
hyacinth
forgets
to
moan
beside
a
sweetness
sadder
than
his
own
a
sweeter
strain
than
orpheus
honeyed
breath
had
sung
to
charm
the
stygian
tides
of
death
and
iris
on
a
heavenly
message
sent
hath
paused
to
hear
this
new
forlorn
lament
this
tender
goddess
of
all
daintiness
stands
tiptoe
holding
up
her
showery
dress
dainty
fingers
till
the
spangled
folds
of
mingled
hues
in
wondrous
bow
she
holds
and
leans
to
learn
what
wondrous
thing
of
beauty
must
prompt
so
sweet
a
lay
forgotten
duty
that
bade
her
speed
to
regions
somnolent
for
balmy
dreams
to
nurse
a
languishment
that
pales
the
boyish
cheek
of
dimpled
cupid
she
speeds
where
all
of
beauty
minions
groupéd
do
feast
their
eyes
upon
the
source
of
song
and
after
her
still
comes
a
charmed
throng
from
music
toils
the
slaves
of
loveliness
ah
when
this
radiant
scene
her
eye
doth
bless
what
sighs
are
born
of
deep
enraptured
joy
and
iris
now
recalls
the
languid
boy
for
this
is
psyche
this
the
dainty
nymph
whose
love
hath
paled
his
cheek
to
dewy
lymph
and
all
aflame
to
do
a
happy
thing
she
bounds
away
upon
her
swiftest
wing
to
somnus
gloomy
cavern
scarce
a
thought
might
mark
the
time
in
which
her
pinions
brought
her
to
the
drowsy
rug
of
poppies
spread
where
drowsy
somnus
nods
his
hoary
head
his
myriad
minions
like
the
forest
leaves
when
some
wild
gust
their
autumn
rest
upheaves
rush
to
her
overwhelming
lethe
fumes
of
sweet
seduction
oozing
from
the
glooms
that
shield
the
murky
river
drag
to
aching
her
wearied
eyes
and
her
sense
forsaking
she
fain
would
rest
upon
the
poppied
rug
like
some
pale
orient
deep
within
a
drug
but
is
the
dream
of
godly
sleep
and
scare
her
eyes
have
fluttered
when
a
peep
of
golden
fragments
tantalize
their
sense
to
waking
thus
to
try
with
soul
intense
to
reconstruct
some
evanescent
gleam
of
something
they
remember
ah
what
dream
so
fair
as
psyche
sleeping
in
a
fairy
ring
so
fair
as
languid
love
sad
wandering
to
grief
or
joy
along
a
feverish
beam
she
wakes
the
drowsy
god
demands
a
dream
and
quits
the
sunless
cave
with
winged
morpheus
and
now
again
the
amorous
sire
of
orpheus
they
meet
and
now
the
sad
immortal
strain
shall
lure
them
on
to
psyche
dell
again
what
though
the
thracian
queen
may
bide
but
ill
miscarrying
chance
with
her
imperial
will
sweet
iris
hath
a
gentler
thought
she
brings
the
dream
to
see
those
luminous
sleeping
wings
all
pied
and
crested
like
a
tiger
moth
when
from
a
soothing
beam
his
heart
is
loth
to
part
and
basks
for
very
idleness
those
tiny
feet
where
they
so
lightly
press
as
not
to
weight
a
daisy
to
the
earth
turned
dimple
breasts
such
beauty
of
one
birth
as
nature
yields
no
more
one
small
hand
prest
against
them
coldly
white
and
one
carest
by
raptured
blooms
outstretched
upon
the
grasses
and
oh
her
head
what
glory
there
surpasses
of
golden
ringlets
curling
and
uncurling
as
gentle
zephyr
with
a
silent
purling
plays
free
among
them
scarcely
parted
lips
so
flower
like
a
wild
bee
drops
and
sips
so
sweet
he
flies
away
full
honey
laden
unconscious
of
his
lightness
such
a
maiden
that
morpheus
eld
historian
of
th
ideal
must
write
another
canto
softly
steal
the
fine
emotions
his
countenance
as
though
a
prism
unveiléd
hues
should
dance
upon
a
shy
chamelion
seeing
this
the
happy
iris
mounts
upon
his
bliss
with
soothing
words
thou
seest
the
butterfly
whose
flooding
beam
hath
drown
dear
cupid
eye
the
queen
demands
thou
bring
him
fairest
pleasure
of
all
the
joys
thou
holdest
in
thy
measure
sweet
psyche
story
whispered
by
the
wind
in
every
dewy
flower
cup
find
as
deeply
mirrored
as
the
starry
skies
fly
to
the
fretting
boy
with
dear
surprise
of
all
thy
cunning
kiss
his
fevered
lips
as
psyche
then
when
doubting
falls
and
slips
still
left
unmarred
their
blissful
stream
of
life
sweet
whisper
tales
of
life
and
love
arife
to
guide
his
swooning
fancy
from
its
pain
to
revel
in
the
life
of
love
again
the
dream
hath
kindled
to
a
gorgeous
hue
out
speaking
words
and
in
a
drop
of
dew
hath
read
sweet
psyche
tearful
story
and
lo
the
boy
beholds
a
growing
glory
of
something
rich
and
old
and
feels
the
sense
of
olden
kisses
planted
quick
intense
and
warm
caresses
softly
lingering
to
lose
no
dear
sensation
blushes
bring
in
quick
succession
while
his
chin
atilt
tender
fingers
meets
a
raptured
lilt
of
love
for
love
as
lovers
only
know
and
he
hath
seen
the
bitter
path
of
woe
each
ragged
rock
her
feet
have
limp
upon
each
hopeless
deep
and
heard
each
bitter
moan
and
he
hath
seen
her
loving
spirit
burn
to
ope
for
him
the
glory
of
the
urn
such
glory
as
her
joyful
eyes
have
drunken
till
drugg
with
their
own
beauty
they
have
sunken
unto
a
dreamless
swoon
where
ringed
thime
hath
framed
an
art
to
rare
to
draw
in
rhime
then
hath
he
risen
from
his
joyless
bed
thrown
off
his
garb
of
woe
and
swiftly
sped
adown
the
olden
path
and
like
a
thought
his
heart
hath
brought
him
to
this
valley
fraught
with
his
rich
treasure
all
his
soul
asinging
to
name
the
bubbling
hope
that
he
is
bringing
and
softly
as
a
warming
shadow
falls
on
flowery
paths
along
the
sunny
halls
his
gentle
words
caress
her
sleeping
ear
with
all
the
magic
love
that
she
hath
long
to
hear
a
blossom
opening
to
the
morning
sun
with
white
cold
cheeks
the
dew
hath
dreamed
upon
hath
never
opened
sweeter
eyes
than
hers
such
sudden
pulsing
breast
such
light
that
stirs
such
eyes
unmeasured
deep
as
closely
folded
in
strong
white
arms
her
being
is
remolded
and
lo
he
leads
her
scarce
a
thought
beyond
and
there
where
she
hath
written
in
the
sand
as
though
a
wizzard
waves
a
magic
wand
the
palace
rises
new
and
passing
grand
a
toast
to
b
my
soul
is
a
beaker
of
wine
and
the
bubbles
that
flash
to
the
brim
are
the
nameless
wild
songs
of
mine
and
the
ruby
is
sparkling
with
them
ah
the
beaker
is
sparkling
and
brimming
we
die
but
there
life
in
the
bowl
while
the
bubbles
are
rising
and
swimming
camerado
i
pledge
thee
my
soul
whisper
to
my
love
ah
music
whisper
to
my
love
some
golden
fancy
of
thy
clime
some
glorious
sound
to
breath
around
a
sweetness
sweeter
than
my
rhime
of
sweet
breath
thime
in
orange
grove
when
she
may
rove
as
wild
and
free
as
the
dryads
be
that
circle
there
around
above
her
to
tell
her
that
i
love
her
ah
beauty
whisper
to
my
love
some
glorious
fervor
of
thy
being
on
golden
sands
of
orient
strands
by
limpid
lakes
where
she
is
fleeing
and
there
is
seeing
the
classic
grace
of
her
proud
race
as
wild
and
free
as
the
dryads
be
that
circle
there
around
above
her
to
tell
her
that
i
love
her
ah
pleasure
whisper
to
my
love
some
happiness
as
sweet
as
thine
when
wild
bee
sips
the
honey
drips
in
early
may
and
lowing
kine
in
dreamy
line
have
led
her
feet
to
the
pastures
sweet
as
wild
and
free
as
the
dryads
be
that
circle
there
around
above
her
to
tell
her
that
i
love
her
sweet
trine
oh
whisper
to
my
love
such
wildest
pleasures
thou
hast
known
of
lake
or
strand
or
land
in
happy
regions
all
thine
own
of
dreamy
zone
where
all
day
long
hast
sung
her
song
as
wild
and
free
as
the
dryads
be
that
circle
there
around
above
her
to
tell
her
that
i
love
her
ode
to
a
rural
scene
oh
soul
of
balsam
calm
sweet
rural
scene
thy
spirit
hand
hath
led
me
back
again
by
pebbly
paths
to
mossy
couches
green
and
where
the
glowworm
and
the
moth
have
lain
to
lie
and
dream
or
on
some
warm
and
soothing
rock
supine
to
watch
the
white
clouds
flee
and
flock
on
everchanging
wings
of
childhood
sweet
imaginings
or
seeking
out
some
shadowy
stream
where
playful
fishes
flash
and
gleam
and
vanish
a
wild
thing
too
dull
leaden
footed
care
to
banish
how
i
would
seem
along
the
smoky
autumn
afternoon
where
fall
the
brown
leaves
wandring
aimlessly
what
song
of
forest
pine
what
wild
bird
tune
hath
waked
me
not
to
life
but
still
to
be
a
spirit
wild
to
cut
me
from
the
hickory
bough
a
whistle
piping
music
sweet
enow
and
on
the
swinging
vine
as
free
as
bacchus
munch
the
wine
from
purple
festoons
undefiled
or
with
the
wild
winds
sport
from
hill
to
hill
as
happy
as
the
dewy
balm
they
drink
and
spill
their
nameless
child
or
where
the
rain
falls
in
the
dust
of
winding
lanes
to
seek
no
place
but
bare
the
soul
to
greet
the
coolly
gust
and
laugh
to
feel
the
cold
rain
in
the
face
what
joys
are
mine
of
haunted
nook
and
hidden
dingle
where
life
and
dimpling
mirth
may
meet
and
mingle
and
clear
melodious
plot
to
pipe
sweet
ditties
of
their
lot
till
the
sad
soul
that
did
repine
shall
wake
to
consciousness
as
sweet
and
wild
as
some
lone
dreaming
of
her
child
and
as
divine
along
these
paths
what
amorous
gods
have
pass
what
wood
nymphs
vanished
down
these
shadowy
lanes
what
happy
olden
memories
here
may
last
of
shepherd
lassies

pageantry

not
of

my
soul
entrance
if
now
the
mock

notes
in

liquidity
of

tells
his

bird

his

bough

in

leafy

sequestered

shall
fret
and

all

to

some
music
fainter

on
its
pinions
till
the
soul
must
deem
that
it

it
hath
been
ever
singing
so
and
thus
to
grow
as
fine
and
clear
like
sound
to
come
to
dream
to

nought

the

ear
ode
to
a
bee
thou
busy
bee
thou
happy
bee
how
would
i
follow
on
thy
viewless
course
to
clover
dell
or
lusher
linden
tree
and
lose
within
thy
honey
charmed
source
all
that
i
am
of
hope
or
fondest
dream
to
be
as
thou
a
honeyed
spirit
wild
no
more
no
more
from
golden
worth
astray
for
what
may
fairer
seem
but
drinking
still
with
spirit
undefiled
the
heavy
secrets
of
the
summer
day
no
fruitless
season
mocks
thee
with
its
frown
no
dross
within
thy
waxen
treasure
dome
no
dark
remorse
may
ever
weigh
thee
down
but
laughing
nature
bids
thee
lightly
roam
from
scene
to
scene
wherever
joy
may
be
not
aimless
on
from
gloom
to
gloom
but
with
a
purpose
greater
than
thy
days
yet
art
thou
wholly
free
to
go
to
come
to
sleep
in
folded
bloom
no
custom
bids
thee
name
thy
wondrous
ways
within
thy
far
and
olden
orient
vales
sweet
houris
nursed
and
watched
thee
long
ago
and
thou
hast
heard
the
soft
and
lowly
couched
tales
of
lovers
luting
all
the
heart
sweet
woe
without
the
harem
amorous
oriels
and
guarded
sighs
of
maidens
veiled
and
pining
and
demon
lovers
wailing
sad
nights
long
within
the
wildest
dells
or
sprite
of
roses
couched
in
velvet
lining
sad
thorn
struck
nightingales
low
dying
song
old
caravans
have
plundered
all
thy
treasure
to
feed
the
beauty
of
the
nile
thou
hast
not
pined
nor
lost
thy
queenly
pleasure
but
out
of
ruins
wrought
new
domes
the
while
but
lo
they
robbed
thy
rosy
land
of
thee
ah
then
how
blushed
the
spirit
of
the
west
that
welcomed
thee
his
spirit
bride
to
flee
to
flee
to
flee
what
spread
of
burning
wings
what
golden
quest
for
panting
bliss
in
fields
untried
sweet
critic
of
the
fairest
and
the
sweetest
thou
hast
not
paused
to
mar
the
honey
less
and
who
knows
where
thy
winged
soul
is
fleetest
what
holidays
thou
hast
of
happiness
to
drink
the
viewless
honey
of
the
air
i
saw
thee
on
the
golden
rod
at
noon
at
evening
by
the
frail
anemone
which
beauty
charmed
thee
there
didst
ease
thy
heart
or
golden
weighted
shoon
within
thy
far
and
hearted
tree
away
away
farewell
thou
winged
sprite
from
dale
to
dale
from
hill
to
farthest
hill
the
radiant
blue
hath
melted
round
thy
flight
but
like
an
ariel
dream
i
see
thee
still
where
thou
hast
vanished
yet
not
wholly
gone
and
i
must
sing
thee
of
a
treasure
dome
of
drossless
gold
which
thou
hast
filled
unwitting
then
too
to
wander
on
like
thee
as
fain
to
pause
as
fain
to
roam
forever
pausing
and
forever
flitting
to
death
ah
death
thou
art
a
strange
and
delicate
thing
pale
hooded
sister
of
sweet
sleep
that
like
a
patient
holy
nun
upon
a
battle
steep
hath
watched
from
sun
to
sun
each
laboring
breath
that
welcomes
thee
sweet
death
whilst
thou
with
cooling
balm
do
quiet
lips
where
lonely
anguish
cries
and
draw
cool
shades
for
wearied
eyes
and
layeth
speechless
calm
upon
each
fevered
brow
with
strokings
of
thy
coolly
palm
and
thou
and
only
thou
hath
alms
more
sweet
than
psalms
to
famished
souls
on
barren
goals
what
draughts
of
long
forgetfulness
hath
held
to
moaning
thirst
to
drink
to
drink
and
drinking
wildly
bless
that
thou
the
last
shall
be
the
first
what
depths
of
great
eternal
night
hast
held
to
failing
eyes
till
pregnant
with
the
awful
sight
a
spirit
in
them
lies
that
is
not
life
i
see
thee
calming
strife
and
age
old
bitterness
the
young
man
mockery
of
the
old
hath
seen
thy
face
and
trembles
all
acold
i
see
thee
in
the
bride
deep
fathomless
eyes
that
flash
with
sudden
consciousness
while
all
her
pulses
rise
to
greet
sweet
motherhood
i
see
thee
in
the
lonely
wood
with
hardy
woodsmen
clearing
future
cities
and
hardy
daughters
chanting
ditties
that
are
the
songs
of
queens
to
be
i
see
thee
in
the
golden
halls
of
gaity
where
trips
the
lure
of
beauty
ankle
deep
and
where
the
faded
kings
and
queens
in
kindly
shadows
creep
i
see
thee
in
the
busy
marts
of
blood
and
brain
and
in
the
crowded
thoroughfares
of
ceaseless
noise
and
sightless
glares
that
lead
to
woods
again
i
see
thee
by
the
nervous
ocean
that
trembles
still
with
wild
emotion
and
brings
sad
pennance
for
its
night
of
wrath
i
see
thee
on
the
lonely
mountain
path
that
leadeth
ever
up
and
down
i
see
thee
in
the
golden
brown
that
burns
gay
summer
bonny
cheeks
i
see
thee
in
the
light
that
seeks
a
soberer
gown
along
the
afternoon
i
see
thee
by
the
harvest
moon
and
hear
thee
in
the
reaper
distant
song
and
whither
this
may
rise
and
that
be
planting
soon
i
see
thine
hooded
shadow
glide
along
i
see
thee
with
the
poet
on
the
hills
of
soul
expression
i
see
thee
with
the
raptured
alchemist
in
session
while
each
his
magic
mirror
fills
with
drossless
gold
of
music
art
and
poesy
whence
the
world
such
beauty
spills
that
sorrow
can
not
be
i
hear
thee
in
the
lovers
lilt
of
careless
brightness
i
see
thee
in
the
lightness
of
amorous
lips
atilt
i
hear
thee
in
the
dreamy
serenade
that
wakes
the
charméd
ear
of
night
and
loosens
in
some
farthest
glade
a
mocking
bird
to
lyric
flight
i
see
thee
where
the
silence
falls
on
haunted
sleep
men
lie
within
and
ah
thy
dreamless
solace
calls
far
faint
and
thin
and
ever
calls
till
perfect
silence
falls
i
see
thee
hear
thee
feel
thee
every
where
o
passing
breath
and
life
is
glorified
for
thou
art
there
o
death
a
dirge
i
saw
a
lassie
on
the
green
ah
me
ah
me
no
sweeter
sight
since
have
i
seen
nor
ever
more
may
see
at
morning
fair
at
evening
pale
and
overcast
oh
stay
thou
lassie
sad
and
frail
why
seek
the
night
so
fast
i
took
her
hand
was
limp
and
cold
she
had
no
smile
and
in
her
eyes
gleamed
something
old
that
flickered
out
the
while
and
then
she
told
such
piteous
tale
and
heaved
a
sigh
i
dreamed
that
beauty
could
not
fail
nor
simple
pleasure
die
i
held
him
long
i
held
him
fast
but
he
has
gone
oh
stay
me
not
this
way
he
past
and
i
must
hasten
on
i
saw
a
wannish
haggard
in
the
night
alone
was
she
i
heard
her
laugh
her
eyes
were
bright
ah
me
ah
woe
is
me
time
and
rhime
ah
ha
a
is
the
time
a
foolish
piece
and
to
teach
her
gentle
daughter
rhime
to
flirt
and
dance
with
everybody
her
cheek
was
fresh
and
passing
fair
when
very
few
did
come
to
court
her
and
king
or
swain
must
worship
there
that
dared
or
fancied
to
transport
her
and
often
there
a
sceptered
king
and
often
there
a
wit
or
jester
have
fondly
kneel
her
praise
to
sing
and
learned
how
sore
it
is
to
pester
but
now
alas
is
come
to
pass
she
loves
the
addlest
headed
dandy
a
lyric
suits
the
lass
her
epic
is
a
piece
of
candy
the
poet
and
the
world
a
poet
came
in
a
golden
noon
his
eyes
were
bright
and
his
soul
in
tune
and
he
sang
a
song
of
a
nameless
bird
and
never
a
song
of
songs
was
sung
as
sweet
and
as
rich
as
the
lay
that
sprung
from
the
muse
in
the
lyrical
verd
an
old
man
dozing
and
dying
alone
hath
startled
enrapt
at
the
wondrous
tone
and
thinks
on
his
own
youth
minstrelsy
and
his
fingers
tremble
and
itch
again
and
his
tongue
is
lashed
in
its
bed
of
pain
to
know
at
last
such
music
may
be
a
youth
starts
up
with
his
soul
on
fire
and
shatters
his
harp
for
something
higher
and
sings
of
a
glory
he
has
not
known
till
his
mad
soul
sinks
on
the
raging
sea
as
sad
and
as
weary
as
spent
wings
be
in
the
guideless
paths
where
his
hopes
have
flown
and
a
maiden
adream
in
her
virgin
bower
of
her
love
bright
star
and
its
rising
hour
hath
heard
the
song
and
her
being
is
folden
to
the
starry
breast
of
a
winged
god
in
the
golden
paths
of
a
garden
untrod
which
her
soul
in
the
lyric
depths
beholden
but
the
world
hath
roused
on
its
listless
bed
and
calls
to
the
ass
for
his
bray
instead
and
lo
he
hath
named
the
song
and
the
bird
and
the
young
man
lives
and
the
old
man
dies
and
the
god
hath
flown
from
the
maiden
eyes
and
the
singer
is
gone
and
the
song
is
a
word
the
guerdon

carved
for
us

in
stone

of

us
starved

dying
unknown
still

they

for
the

upbuilding
its
throne

this
is
the
guerdon
each
bears
to
his

and
this
is
the
jewel
i
wear
on
my
heart
with
a
dream
to
bind
it
this
is
the
treasure
you
sought
from
the
start
forgetting
to
find
it
what
is
so
sweet
as
the
song
of
a
bird
that
wakens
the
fancy
that
hears
it
and
this
is
the
music
i
hear
in
my
heart
whose
heaven
enspheres
it
this
is
the
heaven
you
sought
from
the
start
forgetting
to
pierce
it
what
is
so
glad
as
the
heart
of
a
child
that
gambols
as
careless
as
maytime
and
this
is
the
pleasure
i
hold
to
my
heart
acalling
it
daytime
this
is
the
pleasure
you
sought
from
the
start
forgetting
the
playtime
to
x
boast
not
poor
man
that
thou
hast
measured
time
and
named
it
feeble
seven
thousand
years
lest
all
the
lore
and
wit
of
all
thy
seers
must
brand
thee
fool
and
name
thy
folly
i
say
that
i
have
seen
an
eon
rime
upon
thy
father
head
and
bitter
tears
quintillions
old
and
countless
fears
remembered
from
an
old
world
mapless
clime
nor
call
thy
folly
old
was
surely
born
when
thou
didst
cease
to
think
thou
hast
a
child
whose
beauty
brands
thee
for
a
thing
forsworn
leave
thou
its
tender
reason
undefiled
for
shame
to
chain
the
base
of
all
thy
glory
upon
an
olden
tale
a
useless
allegory
on
a
festal
night
above
the
city
hangs
a
limpid
glare
from
hollow
laughter
laden
festal
board
thou
seest
the
lover
fondling
his
adored
thou
hearest
music
singing
of
her
hair
thou
seest
the
tryst
that
neither
here
nor
there
thou
seest
the
gallant
with
his
mocking
sword
and
honor
at
his
feet
the
miser
hoard
and
lo
the
music
sword
and
tryst
are
there
say
when
has
music
breathed
a
song
encored
so
long
as
yonder
jingling
gold
say
when
do
lover
from
the
throng
turn
wholly
from
the

is
sold
ah
man

gold
where
erst
it
did
belong
then

as
of
old

and
thou
hast
seen
yon

in
holy
stole
but
thinkest
never
yet
a
jackal
skin
embodied
more
hereditary
sin
and
he
with
healing
ointment

my

is
the
maiden
april
calling
calling
to
the
languid
south
where
she
lounges
in
the
sunshine
with
a
secret
at
her
mouth
where
she
lounges
with
the
sunshine
closely
fondled
to
her
breast
calling
for
that
fickle
lover
wanders
with
his
old
unrest
and
her
lips
are
full
and
luscious
where
a
thousand
joys
have
kissed
ah
i
must
unto
her
garden
lo
i
tremble
for
the
tryst
for
her
couch
it
is
a
languor
cushioned
for
a
passion
rest
woven
out
of
dreams
and
sunshine
pillowed
with
her
pulsing
breast
and
i
clasp
her
warm
embraces
kissing
deep
her
dewy
lips
like
a
bee
upon
a
blossom
where
the
honey
breathes
and
drips
lie
within
her
warm
embraces
till
the
wildest
passions
wane
fall
to
dreaming
of
nirvana
pictured
through
a
golden
rain
there
adream
with
dreaming
april
in
the
gentle
southern
land
hearing
footsteps
onward
pressing
only
she
might
understand
feel
the
cool
wind
fan
the
forehead
drink
the
mellow
wine
he
brings
till
the
spirit
drunk
to
fervor
sweeps
its
own

the

brings
a

from

seeing
then
that

is
rainfall
falling
on
a

that

drinking
all
the

call
it
death

it

seeing

not

is
the

uncreated
nay
is
older
than

is
today
a

beaten
outward
by

it
is

where
an

still

seeing
space
is
only
measured
with

atom
of

seeing
space
and

are
brothers
racing
from

goal
to
goal
seeing
systems
all
unnumbered
numbered
by
their
vanished
race
seeing
time
among
his
diamonds
launching
systems
unto
space
till
the
soul
turns
back
to

faint

the

thine

as
in

what
matchless
dearth
of
fact
old
art
bent
low
in
arabesque
transmuting
life
to
things
grotesque
and
his
golden

a

thee
all
rapture
reinact

that
all
thine

by

thee
on

good

my

good

good
night
but
golden
morn
must
sound
her
horn
and
when
the
morning
triton
horn
is
heralding
thy
homing
flight
i
meet
thee
on
the
shores
of
morn
good
night
my
love
good
night
good
night
my
south
of
the
languorous
south
with
her
mouth
and
her
easy
ways
i
sing
ah
see
where
she
stands
my
lady
of
lands
with
a
rose
in
her
hair
and
a
gracious
air
where
her
lovers
cling
will
she
play
me
false
for
the
promised
waltz
in
that
easiest
way
of
hers
ah
see
she
is
fair
as
the
rose
in
her
hair
and
the
sweet
love
drips
from
her
honied
lips
when
her
fancy
stirs
will
she
lightly
resist
for
the
promised
tryst
with
a
smile
of
her
easy
ways
ah
see
she
is
smiling
with
a
sweetness
beguiling
all
sorrow
to
laughter
till
it
dances
thereafter
in
a
golden
maze
alas
she
dances
away
haphazard
her
favor
confers
ah
see
where
she
dances
and
her
sunlit
glances
all
scattered
apart
but
i
store
in
my
heart
a
smile
of
hers
to
lloyd
mifflin
a
poet
and
thou
hast
oped
the
matrix
of
sweet
thought
and
graven
on
the
gem
rare
imagery
or
piercing
free
thine
arts
reality
hast
found
uncarven
gods
as
richly
wraught
such
tints
of
soul
such
matchless
colors
fraught
with
all
thy
beings
dearest
phantasy
such
fair
illusive
forms
that
luring
flee
within
the
crystal
web
of
fancy
caught
till
to
thine
eyes
a
radiant
cosmos
spreads
in
crystaline
delight
from
pole
to
pole
of
godly
folk
at
play
on
flowry
meads
and
one
fair
form
of
beauties
finished
whole
then
through
the
golden
mist
one
fancy
threads
it
is
the
god
of
gods
thy
pristine
soul
keats
thou
golden
fragment
of
the
sweetest
dream
that
ever
smiled
beside
the
gates
of
morn
and
left
enraptured
beauty
half
forlorn
and
half
entranced
still
for
thy
vanished
gleam
that
weeps
on
her
refulgent
stream
no
more
the
tinted
bark
is
lightly
borne
but
frail
as
thought
by
streaming
phantoms
torn
she
waits
forever
thy
returning
beam
a
golden
dream
of
art
divinity
and
held
bright
beauty
jeweled
anadem
of
music
breathing
immortality
till
stonéd
silence
falls
a
carven
gem
and
but
a
fragment
ah
couldst
thou
have
sated
a
bursting
heart
what
worlds
had
been
created
a
poet
as
one
who
flowers
in
a
dream
hath
found
a
vanished
passion
all
in
bloom
and
wild
sweet
odors
lifting
in
the
gloom
of
olden
time
but
casts
it
on
a
stream
to
mar
the
silver
moon
reflectant
beam
and
laugh
at
circles
sweeping
on
to
doom
in
dusky
marges
shining
in
her
brume
hath
england
found
thee
thus
her
silly
deem
ah
shame
that
she
whose
head
is
vaunted
so
hath
vision
narrowed
to
a
needle
eye
and
only
far
from
home
doth
england
know
that
she
has
doomed
another
son
to
die
but
fair
columbia
brings
her
wreath
of
woe
sweet
rhine
a
tear
and
lyric
france
a
sigh
the
critics
and
when
thy
soul
had
made
a
simple
song
and
laughed
for
very
glee
to
sing
and
sound
it
outside
the
walls
the
dim
mysterious
throng
wrought
keen
and
barbed
darts
wherewith
to
wound
it
there
was
a
fault
a
fearful
deadly
fault
and
loud
they
screamed
a
very
named
it
as
one
they
saw
as
one
they
would
assault
each
kneeling
archer
drew
his
dart
and
aimed
it
and
lo
how
fared
a
myriad
archetypes
a
myriad
fancies
sounds
and
colors
riddled
and
harps
and
horns
and
flutes
and
lutes
and
pipes
and
o
the
laugh
as
each
some
twiddled
but
still
the
dainty
spirit
sang
its
song
and
laughed
its
laugh
unconscious
of
a
wrong
availability
and
shall
i
join
this
scramble
after
fame
astonish
so
the
free
delightful
spirit
to
bind
his
song
that
fettered
ears
may
hear
it
and
win
an
encore
or
a
sounding
name
or
shall
his
broad
imperial
wings
go
lame
to
make
a
semblance
of
existing
merit
or
fly
no
more
less
favor
disinherit
and
yield
his
lightness
to
an
ordered
game
not
so
and
never
for
the
fickle
throng
one
soaring
rapture
less
in
fancy
free
but
sing
thou
bonden
music
saddest
wrong
my
shackles
melt
for
thee
still
sing
for
never
yet
thy
spirit
song
may
bend
to
crass
availability
a
portrait
she
was
a
breath
of
perfume
so
sweet
one
could
but
stand
and
drink
it
in
until
the
soul
should
burst
a
dream
so
thin
and
airy
fine
it
seemed
a
spirit
bloom
and
left
a
haunting
fragrance
in
the
room
when
it
had
vanished
garb
in
snowy
lynn
so
rare
one
knew
not
where
it
did
begin
a
scented
sunbeam
in
a
human
gloom
and
thou
hast
called
her
woman
woman
only
when
thou
hadst
music
yearning
at
thy
tongue
to
call
her
heaven
aching
fancy
lonely
still
breathes
that
fragrance
in
a
song
unsung
or
wandering
lost
deep
in
a
golden
dream
hears
sweet
white
lurley
from
a
vanished
stream
on
the
death
of
a
young
lady
ah
thou
wert
fairer
than
the
early
morn
thy
dress
all
spangled
with
the
dewy
flowers
a
lynn
soft
woven
in
the
wondrous
hours
that
hedged
about
thy
dreams
but
lo
the
horn
of
some
far
triton
from
the
sea
across
the
bluey
hills
and
tinted
showers
faint
limning
scenes
of
elfin
grots
and
bowers
bound
thee
in
thrall
by
misty
strands
forlorn
thou
couldst
not
longer
bide
the
sweet
low
calling
of
some
sad
for
his
nymph
thou
couldst
not
yield
to
mortal
love
enthralling
and
nerius
calling
in
thy
spirits
coralled
lymph
o
if
our
hearts
have
sweeter
balm
than
tears
it
is
the
call
that
kissed
thy
dreaming
ears
to
my
love
i
can
not
say
how
much
i
love
thee
words
like
wearied
petrels
fall
on
shoreless
seas
but
o
i
love
thee
simple
words
of
these
float
on
the
stormy
soul
like
halcyon
birds
with
speechless
calm
a
golden
zone
engirds
the
thee
and
me
in
worlds
of
nameless
ease
and
promise
fairer
far
than
æetes
no
clouds
there
tempest
tost
but
phantom
herds
of
golden
fleece
feed
in
the
fields
of
blue
and
sunny
harbors
lull
the
freighted
ships
of
tender
song
the
while
thine
hero
woo
for
aye
sweet
message
from
thine
honeyed
lips
or
catch
some
music
from
thy
spheres
above
thee
a
song
of
songs
to
tell
how
dear
i
love
thee
the
storm
king
the
playeth
his
organ
tonight
o
weep
for
the
mortals
that
heareth
at
sea
the
king
of
the
storm
what
god
in
his
might
may
still
the
dread
music
or
silence
the
key
the
lightning
the
thunder
the
rain
and
the
blast
how
he
driveth
each
note
to
its
ultimate
goal
and
the
roll
of
dead
worlds
in
the
infinite
vast
how
they
roll
in
his
soul
in
his
madness
of
soul
the
lightning
the
thunder
the
blast
and
the
rain
how
he
playeth
each
note
for
its
ultimate
soul
his
caverns
great
center
grows
blacker
again
with
the
deep
where
his
musics
great
nebulas
roll
and
grandeur
mad
grandeur
the
sweep
of
his
song
the
raging
and
lurid
storm
grandeur
of
night
till
the
souls
of
the
ages
to
him
but
a
throng
of
beetling
black
nebula
crash
in
their
flight
how
he
laugheth
and
laugheth
this
maddest
of
kings
how
he
rageth
and
rendeth
his
organ
assunder
now
soaring
now
crashing
to
nethermost
springs
the
maddest
of
music
but
never
a
blunder
for
he
smiteth
the
sea
and
he
teareth
the
land
and
never
a
prayer
but
he
laugheth
to
scorn
a
king
and
a
god
should
he
render
less
grand
for
sake
of
the
ghoul
haunted
beeches
of
morn
the
birth
of
fancy
i
dreamed
and
ah
the
dream
was
sweeter
far
than
any
dream
of
poet
ever
or
maiden
praying
to
a
star
on
agne
eve
i
thought
a
glorious
quiver
of
ecstasy
was
trembling
full
with
tears
deep
in
the
eyes
of
a
maternal
thought
and
time
beyond
the
outposts
of
the
years
was
hushed
expectant
all
of
wonder
fraught
for
fancy
cradled
in
a
golden
cloud
had
risen
in
a
dream
of
boundless
glory
while
on
his
brow
his
soul
had
overflowed
and
swiftly
scaled
a
purple
promontory
then
back
again
in
speed
as
dreamy
fleet
and
laid
a
feather
at
my
feet
despair
alas
so
sick
at
heart
my
lips
are
dumb
dull
inquisition
racks
the
aching
brain
i
work
no
more
but
fight
the
growing
pain
of
losing
hours
night
of
heart
no
moonbeams
come
to
bring
thee
twilight
still
ah
still
the
hum
of
artless
industry
the
spirit
chain
that
binds
for
life
sake
still
the
fight
for
gain
that
binds
it
to
th
arena
pale
and
numb
and
i
that
hoped
to
do
so
much
indeed
to
clear
a
path
in
spite
of
time
and
room
to
sing
a
song
ah
now
i
faint
i
bleed
a
conquered
victim
see
the
conqueror
loom
a
careless
frown
and
sword
his
only
creed
and
watching
close
the
turning
thumb
of
doom
the
magazines
if
orpheus
came
to
maga
with
a
song
as
sad
as
tongueless
sorrow
dying
so
sweet
the
weeping
world
should
throng
to
hear
the
strain
but
come
not
flying
the
maga
pennant
unassailable
then
faith
the
song
were
not
available
if
orpheus
singing
in
the
lonely
hills
should
charm
the
world
to
raptured
wonder
and
maga
came
in
wraps
and
frills
and
dainty
tears
to
cry
his
blunder
then
faith
the
world
might
wait
laconical
if
maga
readjust
his
monicle
but
if
perchance
the
godly
singer
should
pass
like
bitter
grief
with
time
what
ho
the
dandy
crooks
his
finger
and
menials
bring
each
orphean
rhime
and
maga
bards
and
maga
sages
write
epitaphs
on
tombs
of
pages
the
sphinx
beside
the
falls
of
ancient
walls
and
golden
halls
entomb
forever
on
lonely
sands
with
phantom
bands
a
figure
stands
called
never
never
her
eyes
are
green
as
sheen
with
glories
seen
in
distant
ages
as
dongon
keep
her
eyes
are
deep
and
there
asleep
enchanted
mages
a
thousand
years
of
hopes
and
fears
with
dying
cheers
her
cohort
only
a
thousand
miles
of
vanished
piles
of
olden
whiles
her
empire
lonely
from
night
to
morn
of
glory
shorn
she
stands
forlorn
her
only
glory
from
sun
to
frost
a
night
uncrossed
forever
lost
an
endless
story
a
shell
full
wondrous
wrought
and
passing
strange
of
many
a
tint
some
old
and
deathless
work
of
change
for
fairy
wonderment
but
what
of
that
strange
elfin
sprite
that
in
this
rainbow
hall
once
moved
what
woe
or
what
delight
did
make
its
all
in
all
how
roamed
it
through
the
scenery
of
ocean
old
expanse
or
dreamed
in
fragrant
greenery
some
sweet
sea
romance
haughty
king
or
was
it
slave
in
its
unknown
kingdom
there
or
loved
in
elfin
grot
or
cave
some
sweet
fair
alas
like
some
old
haunted
palace
the
silence
how
profound
where
drunk
from
death
deep
chalice
and
turned
the
chalice
down
to
the
traveller
because
thy
winged
spirit
ever
craves
then
must
thou
range
wide
seas
and
distant
lands
to
see
to
know
thy
burning
thirst
demands
no
sweeter
drink
to
kneel
in
sainted
naves
for
art
sake
marvel
by
egyptian
graves
seek
paynim
shrines
with
strange
fantastic
bands
or
pause
to
weep
where
sad
pompeii
stands
so
richly
jewelled
in
her
granite
waves
ah
is
to
know
till
every
cup
is
drained
and
passion
wane
in
pale
satiety
then
but
to
dare
the
boundless
unattained
thy
self
a
world
thy
thirst
its
history
ah
such
a
world
such
wash
of
human
waves
on
human
shores
where
still
the
thirst
enslaves
song
to
death
ah
death
what
a
weakling
art
makes
thee
the
art
of
the
frighten
to
death
gay
curtains
where
glory
forsakes
thee
a
straw
for
the
clutching
last
breath
where
finds
in
religion
a
balm
so
soothing
so
cool
and
so
far
what
solemn
great
hush
and
what
calm
degraded
to
portals
ajar
o
where
is
the
lyric
of
rest
o
where
is
the
song
of
the
soul
unfettered
unmastered
undrest
a
nude
and
a
beautiful
whole
o
where
is
thy
lyric
of
room
unclouded
immeasurable
night
o
where
is
the
song
of
the
doom
still
flawless
of
hope
or
afright
ah
cool
as
the
night
is
the
song
the
dewy
fresh
song
of
my
soul
sung
always
far
over
the
throng
to
a
dewy
unblemishing
goal
some
music
still
unstrung
ungarnished
unmastered
with
art
that
haply
some
feverish
young
may
garner
for
treasure
of
heart
but
never
the
song
that
is
sung
the
sweet
measured
tongue
laps
of
art
that
silvers
old
age
for
the
young
or
maketh
a
ball
room
of
heart
too
great
is
the
prestige
o
death
where
day
ever
bendeth
at
noon
for
false
chanting
or
clutching
for
breath
at
sight
of
the
guerdon
so
soon
too
great
is
thy
prestige
o
death
to
flatter
with
scorn
or
with
fright
no
promise
so
vain
as
that
breath
so
great
so
great
is
thy
night
the
magical
ring
is
an
ash
circled
bower
of
berries
and
musk
and
the
fairies
first
hour
neither
daylight
nor
dusk
and
fancy
is
thridding
in
vistas
of
green
where
the
moth
is
out
bidding
the
cock
for
his
sheen
and
the
bee
with
his
treasure
is
at
rest
on
a
stone
the
measure
of
pleasure
the
depth
of
his
own
the
are
tinkling
the
mocking
birds
woo
in
a
beautiful
sprinkling
of
scintilant
dew
far
down
in
the
grasses
in
a
magical
ring
a
clinking
their
glasses
sits
puck
and
the
king
methinks
saith
the
king
if
the
dome
of
our
palace
were
as
happy
a
thing
as
the
dome
in
this
chalice
of
glittering
dew
and
half
so
resplendent
as
fancy
is
too
in
this
liquor
impendent
methinks
saith
the
king
then
life
were
as
jolly
in
this
magical
ring
as
its
spirit
of
folly
methinks
saith
the
king
titania
were
sweeter
and
this
magical
ring
were
magic
completer
for
the
vixen
is
wild
with
this
squire
from
the
highlands
like
a
sailor
beguiled
to
magical
islands
at
sound
of
a
voice
to
plunge
in
the
sea
foam
and
dying
rejoice
that
the
island
should
be
foam
methinks
saith
the
king
this
rascal
were
better
far
out
of
the
ring
in
handcuff
and
fetter
for
he
talketh
of
love
and
faith
hope
and
charity
and
a
spirit
above
as
the
spirit
of
parity
and
thou
saith
the
king
hath
certain
the
gumption
to
see
thus
the
spring
of
pleasure
consumption
of
late
thou
hast
wandered
to
see
and
be
seen
and
much
thou
hast
squandered
my
riches
i
ween
relate
thine
indentures
important
of
state

all
thine
adventures
of
worth
to
relate
a
trace
of
wine
on
the
breath
of
summer
and
the
spirit
of
june
is
a
pure
delight
and
the
brimmer
of
light
is
sparkling
and
bright
with
a
cheer
for
the
gladdest
comer
aloft
in
the
oak
a
dove
was
cooing
and
a
little
gray
bird
on
sycamore
twig
was
a
pause
abreath
with
a
feathery
sprig
and
flittered
away
to
his
wooing
i
peep
in
a
bloom
and
a
bee
was
in
it
i
peered
on
a
leaf
and
a
moth
slept
there
ah
was
ever
a
dream
so
deliciously
rare
and
all
for
a
minute
then
oberon
winketh
reward
to
