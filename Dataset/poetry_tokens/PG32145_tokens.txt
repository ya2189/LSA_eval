the
poetry
of
each
age
may
be
considered
as
vitally
connected
with
and
as
vividly
reflective
of
its
character
and
progress
as
either
its
politics
or
its
religion
you
see
the
nature
of
the
soil
of
a
garden
in
its
tulips
and
roses
as
much
as
in
its
and
its
towering
trees
we
purpose
accordingly
to
compare
briefly
the
poetry
of
the
past
and
of
the
present
centuries
as
indices
of
some
of
the
points
of
contrast
between
the
two
and
to
show
also
how
and
through
what
causes
the
one
grew
into
the
other
this
will
be
a
fitting
introduction
to
a
consideration
of
the
life
and
writings
of
the
first
of
the
poets
of
this
century
included
in
our
series
the
more
as
he
was
in
a
measure
the
father
of
modern
poetry
it
is
impossible
to
take
up
a
volume
of
the
poetry
of
the
eighteenth
century
such
as
for
instance
churchill
or
pope
or
johnson
and
to
compare
it
with
some
of
the
leading
poetical
works
of
the
present
such
as
the
poems
of
wordsworth
coleridge
shelley
and
byron
and
not
to
feel
as
if
you
were
reading
the
productions
of
two
different
races
of
beings
so
different
are
the
style
the
sentiments
the
modes
of
thought
the
imagery
the
temperament
and
the
spirit
of
the
poets
and
the
poetry
it
is
like
stepping
we
will
not
say
from
the
frigid
but
from
the
temperate
into
the
torrid
zone
in
the
one
class
of
authors
you
find
the
prevalence
of
strong
sense
flanked
by
wit
and
by
fancy
but
without
much
that
can
be
called
imaginative
or
romantic
in
the
other
imagination
or
fancy
is
the
regnant
faculty
and
if
wit
and
sense
are
there
too
they
are
there
as
slaves
the
slaves
of
the
lamp
to
the
imperious
imaginative
power
the
style
of
the
one
is
clear
masculine
sententious
and
measured
that
of
the
other
is
bold
unmeasured
diffuse
fervid
and
sometimes
obscure
the
one
style
may
be
compared
to
a
clear
crescent
the
other
to
a
full
but
partially
eclipsed
moon
the
sentiment
of
the
one
is
chiefly
the
sublimation
of
passion
bitter
contempt
noble
indignation
a
proud
stern
patriotism
sometimes
united
with
a
sombre
but
manly
melancholy
are
the
principal
feelings
expressed
that
of
the
other
although
occasionally
morbid
is
far
more
varied
more
profound
purer
on
the
whole
and
more
poetical
the
thought
of
the
one
is
acute
and
logical
that
of
the
other
aspires
to
the
deep
if
not
to
the
mystical
and
the
transcendental
the
subjects
of
the
poets
of
the
eighteenth
century
are
generally
of
a
dignified
cast
except
in
the
case
of
satirical
productions
such
as
the
temple
of
fame
the
pleasures
of
imagination
the
traveller
london
and
the
vanity
of
human
wishes
the
subjects
of
the
other
class
are
as
varied
as
their
mode
of
treatment
is
often
daringly
peculiar
the
on
his
lonely
moor
the
pedlar
on
his
humble
rounds
the
tinker
linked
by
a
to
the
animal
he
beats
and
starves
a
mad
mariner
a
divorced
wife
a
wandering
rou√©
such
characters
as
these
have
called
forth
the
utmost
stretch
of
the
powers
of
our
best
modern
poets
the
images
of
the
former
race
of
poets
are
limited
to
what
are
called
classical
subjects
including
in
this
term
the
ancient
mythologies
the
incidents
in
grecian
and
roman
story
the
more
beautiful
objects
of
nature
and
the
more
popular
productions
of
art
those
of
modern
poets
acknowledge
no
boundary
from
the
firmament
to
the
fungus
from
niagara
to
the
nearest
puddle
from
the
cold
scalp
of
mont
blanc
to
the
snowball
of
the
schoolboy
all
things
are
free
and
open
to
the
step
of
their
genius
which
like
the
moonbeam
touches
and
beautifies
every
object
on
which
it
rests
the
temperament
of
the
two
races
is
as
distinct
as
their
sentiment
and
style
that
of
the
one
seeming
somewhat
curbed
if
not
cold
while
that
of
the
other
is
ardent
always
and
often
enthusiastic
and
rapturous
different
also
their
spirit
the
one
being
confined
and
sectarian
alike
in
politics
in
literature
and
in
religion
the
other
in
some
of
their
number
being
liberal
to
latitudinarianism
and
genial
to
a
vice
we
are
not
at
present
seeking
to
settle
the
precedence
of
these
two
schools
of
poetry
we
love
and
honour
much
in
both
and
think
the
criticism
small
and
captious
which
can
be
blind
to
the
peculiar
merits
of
either
to
the
terseness
condensation
force
of
single
lines
vigour
of
logical
thought
and
general
correctness
of
the
one
or
to
the
boldness
brilliant
diffusion
breadth
and
variety
of
mood
and
music
of
subject
and
of
treatment
which
distinguish
the
other
it
is
more
specially
our
object
at
present
to
show
how
each
sprang
naturally
and
inevitably
out
of
the
different
ages
when
they
appeared
poetry
is
an
age
in
flower
and
the
poetry
of
the
nineteenth
century
has
been
a
more
gorgeous
and
more
tropical
flower
because
warmer
suns
have
shone
on
it
warmer
winds
blown
on
it
and
larger
rains
watered
its
roots
indeed
it
is
almost
a
wonder
that
the
first
half
at
least
and
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
produced
so
much
and
such
good
poetry
that
age
was
on
the
whole
a
stagnant
and
uninteresting
one
there
was
nothing
very
deeply
to
rouse
the
passions
and
imaginations
of
men
there
was
indeed
the
usual
amount
of
political
squabbles
but
when
a
bolingbroke
was
the
most
eloquent
and
admired
of
parliamentary
orators
what
moral
grandeur
could
be
expected
there
was
a
jacobite
faction
perpetually
undermining
and
sometimes
breaking
out
into
open
rebellion
but
their
enthusiasm
save
in
scotland
was
mingled
with
no
poetical
elements
although
there
certainly
it
produced
many
exquisite
strains
of
ballad
poetry
twice
or
thrice
the
popular
passions
broke
forth
and
reared
up
an
idol
for
themselves
in
the
shape
of
a
private
man
exalted
for
the
nonce
into
a
hero
but
it
is
significant
to
remember
that
the
two
principal
of
these
idols
were
sacheverel
namely
and
jack
wilkes
the
wars
in
that
age
were
almost
entirely
destitute
of
imaginative
interest
those
of
marlborough
such
as
blenheim
and
ramilies
were
just
large
games
of
chess
played
on
a
board
who
now
ever
thinks
or
talks
about
the
battles
of
fontenoy
or
minden
some
tolerable
indeed
there
were
on
the
heights
of
abraham
a
brave
man
expired
in
the
arms
of
victory
and
a
glory
still
lingers
on
the
field
of
prestonpans
and
on
the
bloody
plains
of
culloden
but
there
was
no
trafalgar
no
waterloo
and
no
inkermann
the
manners
of
the
age
were
not
only
dissolute
but
grossly
and
brutally
so
in
england
there
was
no
burns
to
cast
a
gleam
of
poetry
even
on
the
orgies
of
dissipation
all
was
as
coarse
as
it
was
corrupt
it
was
a
drunken
dance
of
naked
satyrs
and
disgust
at
this
state
of
things
we
believe
principally
made
burke
contrasting
the
continent
with
england
to
utter
the
paradox
that
vice
by
losing
all
its
grossness
lost
half
its
evil
foreigners
were
then
as
they
are
still
more
depraved
in
morals
and
filthier
in
personal
habits
than
we
but
they
had
and
have
a
grace
a
politeness
a
reticence
and
an
ease
which
gilded
if
they
did
not
lessen
the
abominations
the
religion
of
the
country
was
reduced
to
a
very
low
point
of
depression
the
churches
were
filled
with
drowsy
divines
drowsily
reading
what
they
never
wrote
to
yet
drowsier
congregations
many
of
the
upper
classes
and
of
the
literary
men
were
avowed
infidels
till
the
rise
of
methodism
religious
enthusiasm
in
any
class
did
not
exist
even
in
scotland
the
load
of
patronage
had
nearly
extinguished
the
old
fires
of
covenanting
zeal
the
state
of
the
lower
classes
was
deplorable
so
far
at
least
as
mental
culture
and
morality
were
concerned
grinning
through
collars
and
hard
drinking
were
their
main
amusements
the
hallowing
and
spiritualising
influences
of
the
were
scarcely
known
and
the
upper
ranks
had
no
feeling
that
they
were
in
some
measure
responsible
for
the
ignorance
and
the
vice
of
the
lower
and
were
bound
to
circulate
education
and
religion
amidst
their
masses
indeed
how
could
they
be
expected
since
they
themselves
had
little
education
and
less
religion
to
circulate
in
science
philosophy
and
general
literature
there
prevailed
a
partial
syncope
and
pause
newton
was
dead
and
had
left
no
successor
locke
was
dead
and
had
left
no
successor
the
wits
of
queen
anne
reign
swift
pope
arbuthnot
steele
and
addison
were
dropping
off
one
by
one
and
for
a
season
none
arose
adequate
to
supply
their
place
it
had
altogether
become
an
age
of
mediocrity
neither
an
age
of
stern
conflict
like
that
of
the
puritans
nor
even
a
fiercely
lawless
and
riotous
age
like
that
of
charles
the
second
nor
a
transition
age
like
that
of
the
revolution
but
an
age
of
a
negative
and
slumbrous
character
its
only
positive
qualities
were
a
generally
diffused
laxity
of
principle
and
corruption
of
practice
but
its
vices
as
well
as
its
virtues
were
small
it
had
not
virtue
to
be
greatly
good
nor
daring
to
be
greatly
wicked
all
this
told
on
its
poetry
and
our
wonder
we
repeat
is
that
it
did
not
tell
more
that
it
did
not
was
probably
owing
to
the
continued
prevalence
of
the
power
of
classical
literature
that
increased
by
the
influence
of
the
universities
and
the
great
schools
and
by
the
translations
made
of
its
masterpieces
by
dryden
and
pope
contributed
to
produce
and
maintain
purity
of
taste
in
the
midst
of
general
depravation
of
manners
and
to
touch
many
opening
minds
with
the
chaste
and
manly
inspiration
of
a
long
past
age
hence
the
poetry
of
the
first
half
of
the
eighteenth
century
while
inferior
in
force
and
richness
to
that
of
the
end
of
the
seventeenth
is
superior
in
good
taste
and
is
much
freer
from
impurities
to
this
the
imitation
of
french
models
too
contributed
still
we
see
the
traces
of
the
period
very
distinctly
marked
in
its
works
of
art
and
in
its
poetry
the
paintings
of
hogarth
next
to
the
infinite
richness
of
the
painter
invention
and
the
accuracy
of
his
observation
and
touch
testify
to
the
corruption
of
these
times
they
are
everlasting
libels
as
true
however
as
they
are
libellous
on
the
age
of
the
first
two
georges
and
we
are
astonished
how
such
an
age
produced
such
a
genius
as
well
as
grieved
to
see
how
such
a
genius
had
no
better
materials
to
work
on
than
were
furnished
by
such
an
age
it
is
much
the
same
with
the
novels
of
smollett
and
fielding
and
with
parts
of
the
poetry
of
churchill
lloyd
and
others
the
formal
wars
of
that
day
too
were
certain
to
produce
formal
poetry
and
blenheim
was
fitly
celebrated
in
addison
campaign
the
sceptical
philosophy
then
prevalent
was
faithfully
mirrored
in
pope
essay
on
man
which
exquisite
as
a
work
of
art
is
in
thought
a
system
of
naturalism
set
to
music
and
while
its
art
is
the
poet
own
its
doctrine
comes
from
the
fell
genius
of
st
john
bolingbroke
up
to
thomson
fine
ode
on
the
death
of
sir
isaac
newton
and
the
night
thoughts
the
great
discoveries
of
astronomy
obtained
no
poetical
recognition
religious
poetry
properly
speaking
there
was
none
for
the
hymns
of
watts
although
full
of
piety
can
scarcely
be
called
poems
and
the
most
popular
poetry
of
the
time
was
either
founded
on
the
latin
or
written
in
imitation
of
pope
johnson
london
and
vanity
of
human
wishes
are
instances
of
the
former
and
of
the
latter
specimens
too
numerous
to
mention
abounded
thus
it
continued
till
about
the
middle
of
the
century
when
there
began
to
appear
symptoms
of
a
change
first
of
all
a
fine
fat
fellow
from
scotland
who
had
derived
inspiration
from
the
breezes
of
the
tweed
and
the
jed
wrote
that
noble
strain
the
seasons
with
its
daguerreotypic
painting
of
nature
and
its
generous
healthy
enthusiasm
and
the
castle
of
indolence
with
its
exquisite
sketches
of
character
and
scenery
and
its
rich
reproduction
of
an
antique
style
of
poetry
thomson
voice
did
not
indeed
produce
a
revolution
in
taste
but
it
obtained
an
audience
for
a
species
of
writing
entirely
different
from
what
then
prevailed
young
next
in
a
bolder
spirit
having
broken
the
trammels
of
pope
which
had
confined
him
soared
up
through
night
and
all
its
worlds
and
brought
down
genuine
inspiration
on
his
adventurous
wing
dr
johnson
although
considerably
hampered
in
his
verse
by
undue
admiration
of
the
mechanical
poets
allowed
himself
greater
liberty
in
his
prose
which
glowed
with
a
deep
if
somewhat
turbid
life
and
rolled
on
in
a
strong
and
solemn
current
which
often
seemed
that
of
high
imagination
collins
smitten
with
a
true
gadfly
born
as
one
out
of
due
time
and
alas
blasted
with
the
celestial
fire
he
brought
anticipated
in
part
some
of
the
miraculous
effects
of
more
modern
poetry
gray
mason
and
beattie
three
men
of
unequal
name
all
wrote
in
a
different
style
from
addison
swift
and
pope
and
two
of
them
displayed
genuine
if
not
very
powerful
genius
then
came
percy
with
his
reliques
of
ancient
poetry
which
showed
what
wonders
our
rude
forefathers
had
wrought
by
the
force
of
simple
nature
and
to
the
same
end
contributed
ossian
poems
which
whatever
their
defects
awakened
and
startled
the
literary
world
here
in
france
and
in
germany
by
a
panoramic
view
of
that
land
of
mountain
and
of
flood
which
was
yet
to
attract
so
many
visitors
and
to
inspire
so
many
bards
the
impulse
lent
to
our
prose
style
by
johnson
was
followed
up
by
junius
and
by
burke
both
of
whom
shot
into
the
discussions
of
politics
and
of
passing
events
much
of
the
spirit
and
the
power
of
poetry
burke
especially
even
before
the
french
revolution
effectually
roused
the
world
had
given
specimens
of
fervid
prose
combining
with
matter
of
fact
and
the
most
compact
wisdom
the
graces
the
spirit
the
imagery
and
the
language
of
the
highest
imagination
cowper
too
had
come
setting
religion
to
rhythm
and
although
veiling
all
the
lightnings
of
his
song
in
sorrow
yet
circulating
the
power
of
his
genius
even
more
extensively
than
the
contagion
of
his
grief
burns
in
scotland
had
exhibited
his
vein
of
ardent
native
genius
and
lastly
the
french
revolution
lifted
up
its
volcano
voice
and
said
to
the
world
of
literature
and
song
as
well
as
to
the
world
at
large
no
from
this
date
the
character
of
poetry
was
changed
and
began
to
assume
that
antagonistic
attitude
to
the
school
of
dryden
and
pope
which
we
described
in
our
commencing
remarks
and
which
yet
continues
britain
got
engaged
in
a
titanic
warfare
an
earthshaking
contest
a
war
of
opinion
not
of
treaties
of
peoples
not
of
kings
and
instead
of
campaigns
our
poets
indited
odes
to
france
to
the
departing
year
hymns
to
carnage
god
daughter
and
visions
of
don
roderick
our
religion
became
more
intense
and
earnest
and
this
produced
on
the
one
hand
the
fine
religious
verses
of
a
montgomery
the
poetical
prose
of
a
foster
and
a
hall
and
the
rapt
effusions
of
a
coleridge
and
wordsworth
and
on
the
other
hand
told
even
on
our
scepticism
which
became
more
impassioned
too
and
wielded
against
religion
a

on

if
any
age
of

has
equalled
the
early
part
of

nineteenth
century
in
the
quantity
or
in
the
quality
in
the
power
depth
brilliance
or
variety
of
its
poetry
william
lisle
bowles
whom
we
have
ventured
to
call
the
father
of
modern
poetry
since
not
only
was
he
first
in
the
field
but
since
his
sonnets
inspired
the
more
powerful
muse
of
coleridge
was
descended
from
an
ancient
and
respectable
family
in
wiltshire
his
grandfather
and
father
were
both
clergymen
in
the
church
of
england
the
poet
was
born
in
king
sutton
and
baptized
there
on
the
of
september
in
the
year
he
was
placed
on
the
wykeham
foundation
at
winchester
his
master
was
dr
joseph
warton
who
seeing
genius
disguised
under
the
veil
of
his
pupil
boyish
timidity
encouraged
him
in
his
efforts
was
warmly
loved
by
bowles
in
return
and
transmitted
to
him
his
very
moderate
estimate
of
the
poetry
and
character
of
pope
bowles
has
testified
his
gratitude
to
his
teacher
in
his
very
pleasing
monody
on
the
death
of
dr
warton
during
the
last
year
he
passed
at
winchester
bowles
was
captain
of
the
school
in
the
year
he
was
elected
a
scholar
of
trinity
college
oxford
having
selected
this
college
because
the
brother
of
his
old
master
thomas
warton
was
residing
there
in
he
gained
the
chancellor
prize
for
latin
verse
calpe
obessa
or
the
siege
of
gibraltar
being
the
subject
of
the
poem
at
college
he
got
no
fellowship
nor
did
he
procure
his
degree
till
at
an
early
age
he
is
said
to
have
been
unsuccessful
in
his
suit
to
a
miss
romilly
a
niece
of
sir
samuel
romilly
and
this
rejection
it
was
which
first
stung
him
into
rhyme
and
rambling
for
in
order
to
deaden
his
feelings
he
traversed
the
north
of
england
scotland
and
parts
of
the
continent
his
first
production
consisted
of
fourteen
sonnets
published
in
and
was
followed
the
same
year
by
verses
to
john
howard
in
he
reprinted
these
and
various
other
pieces
written
in
the
interval
and
in
they
were
reproduced
with
illustrations
they
became
so
popular
that
by
the
year
they
had
reached
a
ninth
edition
almost
every
year
from
till
the
end
of
his
life
mr
bowles
was
adding
to
his
works
new
poems
of
various
merit
in
appeared

besides
the
village
a
very
popular
selection
of
simple
poetry
the
events
of
this
gentleman
private
and
professional
life
were
of
no
particular
interest
having
entered
holy
orders
he
resided
for
many
years
as
curate
in
donhead
st
andrew
in
wilts
where
he
remained
till
when
he
was
appointed
vicar
of
bremhill
a
situation
which
he
continued
to
fill
till
the
end
of
his
long
life
in
he
was
presented
to
the
vicarage
of
checklade
in
wiltshire
which
he
resigned
after
an
incumbency
of
five
years
on
receiving
another
presentation
to
the
rectory
of
dumbleton
gloucestershire
this
living
he
retained
till
his
death
although
he
never
resided
at
either
dumbleton
or
checklade
in
through
archbishop
moore
he
was
made
vicar
of
bremhill
and
the
same
year
prebend
of
stratford
in
the
cathedral
church
of
salisbury
in
he
was
elected
he
had
in
been
appointed
chaplain
to
the
prince
regent
he
resided
constantly
at
bremhill
for
years
after
he
was
elected
canon
however
he
abode
partly
and
in
the
latter
years
of
his
life
principally
in
the
town
of
salisbury
in
he
married
magdalene
daughter
of
the
rev
charles
wake
prebendary
of
westminster
and
of
archbishop
wake
she
died
some
years
before
her
husband
and
left
no
family
bowles
himself
expired
at
salisbury
after
a
gradual
decay
of
the
vital
powers
april
aged
years
his
life
is
about
to
be
written
at
large
by
his
kinsman
dr
bowles
assisted
by
mr
alaric
watts
to
whom
the
publisher
is
indebted
for
the
means
of
supplying
a
complete
copyright
edition
of
the
poet
works
bowles
was
a
diligent
pastor
an
eloquent
preacher
an
active
justice
and
in
every
way
an
estimable
man
even
byron
who
met
him
at
mr
rogers
in
london
speaks
of
him
as
a
pleasant
gentlemanly
man
a
good
fellow
for
a
parson
moore
in
his
diary
speaks
with
delight
of
his
mixture
of
talent
and
simplicity
in
his
introduction
to
scenes
and
shadows
bowles
gives
some
interesting
particulars
of
his
early
life
in
for
august
there
is
a
very
entertaining
account
of
bremhill
parsonage
as
an
author
he
appears
in
three
aspects
as
a
writer
on
typography
as
an
editor
and
controversialist
and
as
a
poet
in
he
produced
a
volume
entitled
the
parochial
history
of
bremhill
and
shortly
afterwards
his
history
of
lacock
abbey
containing
much
interesting
antiquarian
lore
to
this
succeeded
a
still
more
ingenious
and
recondite
work
entitled
hermes
britannicus
besides
some
less
important
writings
of
a
similar
kind
his
life
of
bishop
ken
which
appeared
in
and
might
be
considered
as
belonging
to
the
same
category
of
learned
antiquarian
lucubrations
in
he
published
an
edition
of
pope
in
ten
volumes
for
which
he
received
the
life
prefixed
to
this
edition
led
to
the
celebrated
controversy
between
bowles
on
the
one
hand
and
campbell
byron
roscoe
octavius
gilchrist
and
the
on
the
other
in
our
life
of
pope
we
hope
to
devote
a
few
pages
to
the
principal
questions
which
were
mooted
in
this
controversy
we
may
simply
say
at
present
that
we
think
bowles
was
in
the
main
right
although
he
laid
himself
open
to
retort
at
many
points
and
displayed
an
against
pope
both
as
a
man
and
a
poet
which
he
in
vain
sought
to
disclaim
and
which
somewhat
detracted
from
the
value
of
his
criticisms
he
gained
however
the
three
objects
at
which
he
aimed
he
proved
that
pope
was
only
at
the
head
of
the
rank
of
poets
that
as
a
man
he
was
guilty
of
many
meannesses
and
had
a
prurient
imagination
and
pen
and
that
the
objects
of
artificial
life
are
less
fitted
for
the
purposes
of
poetry
than
those
of
nature
and
than
the
passions
of
the
human
heart
in
this
controversy
as
well
as
in
some
in
his
letters
to
lord
brougham
on
the
position
and
incomes
of
the
cathedral
clergy
in
a
letter
to
sir
james
mackintosh
on
the
increase
of
crime
and
in
a
sharp
fight
with
the
rev
edward
duke
on
the
antiquities
of
wiltshire
bowles
displayed
amazing
pluck
and
no
small
controversial
acuteness
and
dexterity
like
another
ajax
he
took
enemy
after
enemy
on
his
single
shield
and
by
his
pertinacity
and
perseverance
he
succeeded
in
beating
them
all
he
stood
at
first
alone
and
had
very
formidable
opponents
but
he
bated
not
one
jot
of
heart
or
hope
and
by
and
by
southey
and
others
came
to
his
aid
and
finally
william
hazlitt
saw
with
his
inevitable
eye
the
real
merits
of
the
case
and
substantially
inclining
to
the
bowles
side
settled
by
a
paper
in
the
the
question
for
ever
as
a
controversialist
bowles
is
rather
noisy
flippant
and
fierce
and
his
reply
to
byron
while
superior
to
the
noble
bard
letter
in
argument
is
far
inferior
in
easy
and
trenchant
vigour
of
style
his
writings
on
the
pope
controversy
consist
of
a
letter
to
thomas
campbell
two
letters
to
lord
byron
a
final
appeal
to
the
public
relative
to
pope
and
more
last
words
lessons
in
criticism
to
william
roscoe
and
farther
lessons
to
a
quarterly
reviewer
all
are
exceedingly
readable
and
clever
it
is
curious
contrasting
the
spirit
of
bowles
prose
his
severity
his
pugnacity
his
irritability
with
the
mild
qualities
of
his
poetry
the
leading
element
in
all
his
poetical
works
is
sentiment
warm
mellow
tender
and
often
melancholy
sentiment
he
has
no
profound
thought
no
powerful
pictures
of
passion
no
creative
imagination
but
over
all
his
poetry
lies
a
sweet
autumnal
moonlight
of
pensive
and
gentle
feeling
in
his
larger
poems
he
is
often
diffuse
and
verbose
and
you
see
more
effort
than
energy
but
in
his
smaller
and
especially
in
his
sonnets
and
his
pieces
descriptive
of
nature
bowles
is
always
true
to
his
own
heart
and
therefore
always
successful
how
delightful
such
sonnets
as
his
morning
bells
absence
bereavement
and
his
poems
entitled
monody
at
matlock
on
hearing
the
we
trust
that
many
after
reading
these
and
the
others
some
of
which
were
never
before
published
contained
in
our
volumes
will
be
ready
to
express
the
gratitude
of
their
hearts
through
the
medium
of
the
following
beautiful
sonnet
samuel
taylor
coleridge
to
william
lisle
bowles
my
heart
has
thanked
thee
bowles
for
those
soft
strains
whose
sadness
soothes
me
like
the
murmuring
of
wild
bees
in
the
sunny
showers
of
spring
for
hence
not
callous
to
the
mourner
pains
through
youth
gay
prime
and
thornless
paths
i
went
and
when
the
mightier
throes
of
mind
began
and
drove
me
forth
a
man
their
mild
and
manliest
melancholy
lent
a
mingled
charm
such
as
the
pang
consigned
to
slumber
though
the
big
tear
it
renewed
bidding
a
strange
mysterious
pleasure
brood
over
the
wavy
and
tumultuous
mind
as
the
great
spirit
erst
with
plastic
sweep
moved
on
the
darkness
of
the
unformed
deep
his
larger
poems
are
perhaps
more
distinguished
by
the
ambition
of
their
themes
than
by
the
success
of
their
treatment
his
particular
theory
about
the
superiority
of
the
works
of
nature
as
poetical
subjects
perhaps
led
him
to
a
too
uniform
selection
of
its
grander
features
while
undoubtedly
his
genius
fitted
him
better
for
depicting
its
softer
and
smaller
objects
he
excels
far
more
in
interpreting
the
language
of
the
bells
now
of
ostend
and
now
of
oxford
in
describing
the
dingles
of
coombe
ellen
in
echoing
the
fall
of
the
river
avon
heard
in
his
at
bath
or
in
catching
on
his
the
distant
view
of
england
from
the
sea
than
in
coping
with
the
dark
recesses
of
the
american
forest
following
the
daring
gama
round
his
cape
of
storms
standing
with
noah
on
the
brow
of
the
tremendous
mountain
caff
the
hill
of
demons
and
griffins
and
seeing
the
globe
at
his
feet
or
in
walking
beside
the
seer
of
all
time
in
that
isle
which
is
called
patmos
placed
far
amid
the
melancholy
main
he
is
more
at
home
in
the
beautiful
than
in
the
sublime
more
a
warton
than
a
milton
and
may
be
rather
likened
to
a
bee
murmuring
her
dim
music
in
the
bells
of
flowers
than
to
an
eagle
dallying
with
the
tempest
and
binding
distant
oceans
and
chains
of
mountains
together
by
the
living
link
of
his
swift
and
strong
pinion
yet
his
spirit
of
discovery
contains
some
bold
fancy
take
this
for
instance
andes
sweeping
the
horizon
tract
mightiest
of
mountains
whose
eternal
snows
feel
not
the
nearer
sun
whose
umbrage
chills
the
murmuring
ocean
whose
fires
a
thousand
nations
view
hung
like
the
moon
high
in
the
middle
waste
of
the
missionary
of
which
byron
writes
in
some
playful
verses
to
murray
i
read
the
missionary
pretty
very
contains
much
vivid
description
and
interesting
narrative
and
st
john
in
patmos
if
scarcely
up
to
the
mark
of
the
transcendent
theme
has
a
good
deal
of
picturesque
and
striking
poetry
perhaps
the
most
interesting
of
all
his
minor
poems
is
that
entitled
childe
last
pilgrimage
quoted
we
remember
in
moore
life
of
byron
as
proceeding
from
one
whom
the
angry
and
unhappy
childe
had
often
insulted
in
public
and
laughed
at
in
private
it
was
as
graceful
in
spirit
as
it
is
elegant
in
composition
revenge
it
has
been
said
is
a
feast
for
the
gods
and
the
saying
is
true
if
meant
of
that
species
of
revenge
which
gains
its
end
by
forgiveness
an
act
so
noble
and
generous
as
the
writing
of
this
is
calculated
to
set
the
memory
of
bowles
still
higher
than
all
his
poetry

preface
the
estimation
of
a
poem
of
this
nature
must
depend
first
on
its
arrangement
plan
and
disposition
secondly
on
the
judgment
propriety
and
feeling
with
which
in
just
and
proper
succession
and
relief
picture
pathos
moral
and
religious
reflections
historical
notices
or
affecting
incidents
are
interwoven
the
reader
will
in
the
next
place
attend
to
the
versification
or
music
in
which
the
thoughts
are
conveyed
shakspeare
and
milton
are
the
great
masters
of
the
verse
i
have
adopted
but
who
can
be
heard
after
them
the
reader
however
will
at
least
find
no
specimens
of
sonorous
harmony
ending
with
such
significant
words
as
of
and
if
but
of
which
we
have
had
lately
some
splendid
examples
i
would
therefore
only
request
of
him
to
observe
that
when
such
passages
occur
in
this
poem
as
vanishing
hush
it
was
from
design
and
not
from
want
of
ear
an
intermixture
of
images
and
characters
from
common
life
might
be
thought
at
first
sight
out
of
keeping
with
the
higher
tone
of
general
colouring
but
the
interspersion
of
the
comic
provided
the
due
stateliness
be
kept
up
in
the
language
has
often
the
effect
of
light
and
shade
as
will
be
apparent
on
looking
at
cowper
exquisite
task
although
he
has
often
offended
against
taste
the
only
difficulty
is
happily
to
steer
from
grave
to
gay
so
far
respecting
the
plan
the
execution
the
versification
and
style
as
to
the
sentiments
conveyed
in
this
poem
and
in
the
notes
i
must
explicitly
declare
that
when
i
am
convinced
as
a
clergyman
and
a
magistrate
that
there
has
been
an
increase
of
crime
owing
among
other
causes
to
the
system
pursued
by
some
nominal
christians
who
preach
these
three
faith
hope
and
charity
according
to
the
order
of
st
paul
but
keep
two
of
these
graces
and
the
greatest
of
all
out
of
sight
upon
any
human
plea
or
pretension
when
they
do
preach
add
to
your
faith
virtue
when
they
will
preach
christ
died
for
the
sins
of
the
and
not
for
only
when
from
any
pleas
of
their
own
or
persuaded
by
any
sophistry
or
faction
they
become
most
emphatically
dumb
dogs
to
the
sublime
and
affecting
moral
parts
of
that
gospel
which
they
have
engaged
before
god
to
deliver
and
above
all
when
crimes
as
i
am
verily
persuaded
have
been
are
and
must
be
the
consequence
of
such
public
preaching
leaving
others
to
stand
or
fall
to
their
own
god
i
shall
be
guided
by
my
own
understanding
and
the
plain
word
of
god
as
i
find
it
earnestly
simply
beautifully
and
divinely
set
before
me
by
christ
and
his
apostles
and
so
feeling
i
shall
as
fearlessly
deliver
my
own
opinions
being
assured
whether
popular
or
unpopular
whether
they
offend
this
man
or
that
this
sect
or
that
sect
they
will
not
easily
be
shaken
i
might
ask
why
did
st
paul
add
so
emphatically
these
three
when
he
enumerated
the
christian
graces
doubtless
because
he
thought
the
distinction
very
important
why
did
st
peter
say
add
to
your
faith
virtue
because
he
thought
it
equally
important
and
essential
why
did
st
john
say
christ
died
for
the
sins
of
the
whole
world
and
not
for
ours
only
because
he
thought
it
equally
important
and
necessary
never
omitting
the
atonement
justification
by
faith
the
fruits
of
the
spirit
and
never
separating
faith
from
its
hallowed
fellowship
we
shall
find
all
other
parts
of
the
gospel
unite
in
harmonious
subordination
but
if
we
shade
the
moral
parts
down
leave
them
out
contradict
them
by
insidious
sophistry
the
scripture
so
far
from
being
rightly
divided
will
be
discordant
and
clashing
the
man
be
he
whom
he
may
who
preaches
faith
without
charity
who
preaches
faith
without
virtue
is
as
pernicious
and
false
an
expounder
of
the
divine
message
as
he
who
preaches
good
works
without
their
legitimate
and
only
foundation
christian
faith
one
would
suppose
from
the
language
of
some
preachers
the
civil
decent
moral
people
from
the
times
of
baxter
to
the
present
want
amendment
most
we
all
know
that
mere
morals
which
have
no
christian
basis
are
not
the
gospel
of
christ
but
i
might
tell
richard
with
great
respect
notwithstanding
for
i
respect
his
sincerity
and
his
heart
that
at
least
decent
and
civil
and
moral
people
are
not
worse
than
indecent
immoral
and
uncivil
people
and
when
there
are
so
many
of
these
last
i
think
a
word
or
two
of
reproof
would
not
much
hurt
them
let
the
decent
moral
and
civil
be
as
as
they
may
i
hope
it
is
not
necessary
for
me
to
disclaim
in
speaking
of
facts
the
most
remote
idea
of
throwing
a
slight
on
the
sincerely
pious
of
any
portion
of
the
community
but
if
religion
does
not
invigorate
the
higher
feelings
and
principles
of
moral
obligation
if
a
heartless
and
hollow
jargon
is
often
substituted
for
the
fundamental
laws
of
christian
obedience
if
ostentatious
affectation
supersedes
the
meek
unobtrusive
character
of
feminine
devotion
if
a
petty
peculiarity
of
system
a
kind
of
conventional
code
of
godliness
usurps
the
place
of
the
specific
righteousness
visible
in
its
fruits
of
whatsoever
things
are
honest
whatsoever
things
are
just
whatsoever
things
are
lovely
if
to
be
fluent
and
flippant
in
the
jargon
of
this
petty
peculiarity
of
code
is
made
the
criterion
of
exclusive
godliness
when
by
thousands
and
thousands
after
the
example
of
hawker
and
others
of
the
same
school
christianity
is
represented
as
having
neither
an
or
the
conclusion
being
left
for
the
innumerable
disciples
of
such
a
gospel
school
when
because
none
no
not
one
is
and
none
can
stand
upright
in
the
sight
of
him
whose
eyes
are
too
pure
to
behold
iniquity
they
who
have
exercised
themselves
to
have
a
conscience
void
of
offence
toward
god
and
man
though
sensible
of
innumerable
offences
are
considered
by
implication
before
god
as
no
better
than
burkes
or
thurtles
for
the
imputation
of
utter
depravity
must
mean
this
or
be
mere
hollow
et
when
amusements
or
recreations
vicious
only
in
their
excess
are
proclaimed
as
national
abominations
while
real
abominations
stalk
abroad
as
is
the
case
in
large
manufacturing
towns
with
the
lord
the
lord
on
the
lips
of
some
of
the
most
depraved
when
from
these
causes
i
do
sincerely
believe
the
heart
has
been
hardened
and
the
understanding
deteriorated
the
wide
effects
being
visible
on
the
great
criminal
body
of
the
nation
i
conceive
i
do
a
service
to
evangelical
religion
by
speaking
as
i
feel
of
that
ludicrous
caricature
which
so
often
in
society
usurps
its
name
and
apes
and
disgraces
its
divine
character
i
am
not
among
those
who
divide
the
clergy
of
the
church
of
england
into
classes
and
i
think
it
my
duty
ingenuously
to
declare
that
the
opinions
i
have
expressed
of
the
effects
of
such
public
doctrines
as
i
have
described
be
they
preached
or
published
by
whom
they
may
were
written
without
communication
with
any
one
living
i
think
it
right
to
declare
this
most
explicitly
lest
the
distinguished
person
to
whom
this
poem
is
inscribed
might
be
supposed
to
have
any
participation
in
such
sentiments
though
i
trust
no
possible
objection
could
be
made
to
the
manly
avowal
of
my
opinion
of
the
injurious
effects
of
antinomian
or
shades
of
antinomian
doctrines
further
the
object
of
my
remarks
is
piety
but
ostentatious
publicity
and
affectation
far
more
disgusting
in
the
assumed
garb
of
female
piety
than
under
any
shape
and
often
attended
by
far
more
disgusting
than
any
acting
on
any
stage
banwell
cave
the
following
extract
of
a
letter
from
mr
warner
will
enable
the
reader
to
form
his
own
opinion
concerning
the
vast
accumulation
of
bones
in
this
cave
the
sagacity
of
mr
beard
having
detected
the
existence
of
the
cavern
and
his
perseverance
effected
a
precipitous
descent
into
it
the
objects
offered
to
his
notice
were
of
the
most
astonishing
and
paradoxical
description
antre
vast
rude
from
the
hand
of
nature
of
various
elevations
and
branching
into
several
recesses
its
floor
overspread
with
a
huge
mingled
mass
of
bones
and
mud
black
earth
or
decomposed
animal
matter
and
sand
from
the
severn
sea
which
flows
about
six
miles
to
the
northward
of
banwell
village
the
quantity
of
bones
and
the
mode
by
which
they
could
be
conveyed
to
and
deposited
in
the
place
they
occupied
were
points
of
equal
difficulty
to
be
explained
as
the
former
amounted
to
several
waggon
loads
and
as
no
access
to
the
cavern
appeared
to
exist
except
a
fissure
from
above
utterly
incapable
from
its
narrow
dimensions
of
admitting
the
falling
in
of
any
animal
larger
than
a
common
sheep
whereas
it
was
evident
that
huge
quadrupeds
such
as
unknown
beasts
of
the
ox
tribe
bears
wolves
and
probably
hyenas
and
tigers
had
perished
in
the
cave
but
though
the
questions
and
were
unanswerable
conclusion
was
irresistibly
forced
upon
the
mind
by
the
phenomena
submitted
to
the
eye
that
as
the
receptacle
was
infinitely
too
small
to
contain
such
a
crowd
of
animals
in
their
living
state
they
must
necessarily
have
occupied
it
in
succession
one
portion
of
them
after
another
paying
the
debt
of
nature
and
leaving
their
bones
only
as
a
memorial
of
their
existence
on
the
spot
thus
making
room
in
the
cavern
for
a
succeeding
set
of
inhabitants
of
similarly
ferocious
habits
to
themselves
the
difficulty
indeed
of
the
ingress
of
such
beasts
into
the
cave
did
not
long
continue
to
be
invincible
as
mr
beard
discovered
and
cleared
out
a
lateral
aperture
in
it
sufficiently
inclining
from
the
perpendicular
and
sufficiently
large
in
its
dimensions
to
admit
of
the
easy
descent
into
this
subterraneous
apartment
of
one
of
its
unwieldy
tenants
though
loaded
with
its
prey
from
the
circumstances
premised
you
will
probably
anticipate
my
thoughts
on
these
remarkable
phenomena
if
not
they
are
as
follow
i
consider
the
cavern
to
have
been
formed
at
the
period
of
the
original
deposition
and
consolidation
of
the
matter
constituting
the
mountain
limestone
in
which
it
is
found
possibly
by
the
agency
of
some
elastic
gas
imprisoned
in
the
mass
which
prevented
the
approximation
of
its
particles
to
each
other
or
by
some
unaccountable
interruption
to
the
operation
of
the
usual
laws
of
its
crystallization
that
for
a
long
succession
of
ages
anterior
to
the
deluge
and
previously
to
man
inhabiting
the
colder
regions
of
the
earth
banwell
cave
had
been
inhabited
by
successive
generations
of
beasts
of
prey
which
as
hunger
dictated
issued
from
their
den
pursued
and
slaughtered
the
gregarious
animals
or
wilder
quadrupeds
in
its
neighbourhood
and
dragged
them
either
bodily
or
piecemeal
to
this
retreat
in
order
to
feast
upon
them
at
leisure
and
undisturbed
that
the
bottom
of
the
cavern
thus
became
a
kind
of
of
various
and
unnumbered
beasts
that
this
scene
of
excursive
carnage
continued
till
flood
came
blending
oppressor
with
the
oppressed
and
mixing
the
hideous
furniture
of
the
den
with
a
quantity
of
extraneous
matter
brought
from
the
adjoining
shore
and
subjacent
lands
by
the
waters
of
the
deluge
which
rolled
surging
as
kirwan
imagines
from
the
quarter
that
previously
to
this
total
submersion
as
the
flood
increased
on
the
lower
grounds
the
animals
which
fed
upon
them
ascended
the
heights
of
mendip
to
escape
impending
death
and
with
panic
rushed
as
many
as
could
gain
entrance
into
this
of
their
worst
enemies
that
numberless
birds
also
terrified
by
the
elemental
tumult
flew
into
the
same
den
as
a
place
of
temporary
refuge
that
the
interior
of
the
cavern
was
speedilly
filled
by
the
roaring
deluge
whose
waters
dashing
and
crushing
the
various
substances
which
they
embraced
against
the
rugged
rocks
or
against
each
other
and
continuing
this
violent
and
incessant
action
for
at
least
three
months
at
length
tore
asunder
every
connected
form
separated
every
skeleton
and
produced
that
confusion
of
substances
that
scene
of
that
mixture
and
disjunction
of
bones
which
were
apparent
on
the
first
inspection
of
the
cavern
and
which
are
now
visible
in
that
part
of
it
which
has
been
hitherto
untouched
respecting
the
language
of
the
poem
i
had
nearly
forgotten
one
remark
in
almost
all
the
local
poems
i
have
read
there
is
a
confusion
of
the
following
nature
a
local
descriptive
poem
must
consist
first
of
the
graphic
view
of
the
scenery
around
the
spot
from
whence
the
view
is
taken
and
secondly
of
the
reflections
and
feelings
which
that
view
may
be
supposed
to
excite
the
feelings
of
the
heart
naturally
associate
themselves
with
the
idea
of
the
tones
of
the
supposed
poetical
harp
but
external
scenes
are
the
province
of
the
pencil
for
the
harp
can
not
paint
woods
and
hills
and
therefore
in
almost
all
descriptive
poems
the
pencil
and
the
lyre
clash
hence
in
one
page
the
poet
speaks
of
his
lyre
and
in
the
next
when
he
leaves
feelings
to
paint
to
the
eye
before
the
harp
is
out
of
the
hand
he
turns
to
the
pencil
this
fault
is
almost
inevitable
the
reader
therefore
will
see
in
the
first
page
of
this
poem
that
the
graphic
pencil
is
assumed
when
the
tones
of
the
harp
were
inappropriate

if
gazing
from

i
wake
with

thoughts
the

of
poesy
once
more
ere
night
descend
haply
with
tones
fainter
and
haply
with
a
long
farewell
if
looking
back
upon
the
lengthened
way
my
feet
have
trod
since
long
ago
i
left
those
shores
and
when
mine
eyes
are
filled
with
tears
i
take
the
pencil
in
its
turn
and
shading
light
the
landscape
spread
below
so
smilingly
beguile
those
starting
tears
something
the
feelings
of
the

something
the

itself
and
something
more
a
wish
to
gratify
one
generous
mind
may
plead
for
pardon
to
this
spot
i
came
to
view
the
dark
memorials
of
a
world
perished
at
the
almighty
voice
and
swept
with
all
its
noise
away
since
then
unmarked
in
that
rude
cave
those
dark
memorials
lay
and
told
no
tale
spirit
of
other
times
sad
shadow
of
the
ancient
world
come
forth
thou
who
has
slept
four
thousand
years
awake
rise
from
the
cavern
last
recess
and
say
what
giant
cleft
in
twain
the
neighbouring
rocks
then
slept
for
ages
in
vast
ogo
cave
and
left
them
rent
and
frowning
from
that
hour
say
rather
when
the
stern
archangel
stood
above
the
tossing
of
the
flood
what
arm
shattered
this
mountain
and
its
hollow
chasm
heaped
with
the
mute
memorials
of
that
doom
spirit
of
other
times
thou
speakest
not
yet
who
could
gaze
a
moment
on
that
wreck
of
desolation
but
must
pause
to
think
of
the
mutations
of
the
globe
of
time
hurrying
to
onward
spoil
of
his
own
life
swift
passing
as
the
summer
light
away
of
him
who
spoke
and
the
dread
storm
went
forth
the
surge
came
and
the
surge
went
back
and
there
there
when
the
black
abyss
had
ceased
to
roar
and
waters
shrinking
from
the
rocks
and
hills
slept
in
the
solitary
sunshine
there
the
bones
that
strew
the
inmost
cavern
lay
and
when
forgotten
centuries
had
passed
and
the
gray
smoke
went
up
from
villages
and
cities
with
their
towers
and
temples
shone
and
kingdoms
rose
and
perished
there
they
lay
the
crow
sailed
the
spot
the
villager
plodded
to
morning
toil
yet
undisturbed
they
lay
when
lo
as
if
but
yesterday
the
archangel
trump
had
thundered
the
deep
the
mighty
shade
of
ages
that
are
passed
towers
into
light
say
christian
is
it
true
that
dim
recess
that
cavern
heaped
with
bones
will
echo
to
thy
bible
but
a
while
here
let
me
stand
and
gaze
upon
the
scene
that
headland
and
those
winding
sands
and
mark
the
morning
sunshine
on
that
very
shore
where
once
a
child
i
wandered
oh
return
i
sigh
return
a
moment
days
of
youth
of
childhood
oh
return
how
vain
the
thought
vain
as
unmanly
yet
the
pensive
muse
unblamed
may
dally
with
imaginings
for
this
wide
view
is
like
the
scene
of
life
once
traversed
with
carelessness
and
glee
and
we
look
back
upon
the
vale
of
years
and
hear
remembered
voices
and
behold
in
blended
colours
images
and
shades
long
passed
now
rising
as
at
memory
call
again
in
softer
light
i
see
thee
not
home
of
my
infancy
i
see
thee
not
thou
fane
that
standest
on
the
hill
alone
the
homeward
sailor
but
i
view
brean
down
beyond
and
there
thy
winding
sands
weston
and
far
away
one
wandering
ship
where
stretches
into
mist
the
severn
sea
there
mingled
with
the
clouds
old
cambria
draws
its
stealing
line
of
mountains
lost
in
haze
there
in
sit
the
sister
holms
secure
and
tranquil
though
the
tide
vast
sweep
as
it
rides
by
might
almost
seem
to
rive
the
deep
foundations
of
the
earth
again
threatening
as
once
resistless
to
ascend
in
tempest
to
this
height
to
bury
here
carcases
but
lo
the
cave
descend
the
steps
cut
rudely
in
the
rock
cautious
the
yawning
vault
is
at
our
feet
long
caverns
winding
within
caverns
spread
on
either
side
their
labyrinths
all
dark
save
where
the
light
falls
glimmering
on
huge
bones
in
mingled
multitudes
ere
yet
we
ask
whose
bones
and
of
what
animals
they
formed
the
structure
when
no
human
voice
was
heard
in
all
this
isle
look
upward
to
the
roof
that
silent
drips
and
has
for
ages
dripped
from
which
like
icicles
the
stalactites
depend
then
ask
of
the
geologist
how
nature
vaulting
the
rude
chamber
scooped
its
vast
recesses
he
with
learning
vast
will
talk
of
limestone
rock
of
stalactites
and
oolites
and
hornblende
and
graywacke
with
sounds
almost
as
craggy
as
the
rock
of
which
he
speaks
feldspar
and
gneis
and
schorl
but
let
us
learn
of
this
same
troglodyte
who
guides
us
through
the
winding
labyrinth
the
erudite
professor
of
the
cave
not
of
the
college
stagyrite
of
bones
he
leads
with
flickering
candle
through
the
heaps
himself
has
piled
and
placed
in
various
forms
grotesque
arrangement
while
the
cave
itself
seems
but
his
element
of
breathing
look
this
humereus
is
that
of
the
wild
ox
the
very
candle
as
with
sympathy
flares
while
he
speaks
in
glimmering
wonderment
but
who
can
mark
these
visible
remains
nor
pause
to
think
how
awful
and
how
true
the
dread
event
they
speak
what
monuments
hath
man
since
then
the
lord
the
emmet
raised
on
earth
he
hath
built
pyramids
and
said
stand
there
and
in
their
solitude
they
stood
whilst
like
the
camel
shadow
on
the
sands
beneath
them
years
and
ages
passed
he
said
my
name
shall
never
die
and
like
the
god
of
silence
with
his
finger
on
his
lip
oblivion
mocked
then
pointed
to
a
tomb
vast
and
winding
vaults
without
a
name
where
art
thou
thebes
the
chambers
of
the
dead
echo
behold
and
twice
ten
thousand
men
even
in
their
march
of
rapine
and
of
blood
involuntary
halted
at
the
sight
of
thy
majestic
wreck
for
many
a
league
sphynxes
colossal
fanes
and
obelisks
pale
in
the
morning
sun
ambition
sighed
a
moment
and
passed
on
in
this
rude
isle
the
druid
altars
frowned
and
still
they
stand
as
silent
as
the
barrows
at
their
feet
yet
tell
the
same
stern
tale
soldier
of
rome
art
thou
come
hither
to
this
land
remote
hid
in
the
thy
chariot
wheels
rung
on
that
road
below
cohorts
and
turms
with
their
centurions
in
long
file
appear
their
golden
eagles
glittering
to
the
sun
the
last
line
of
spears
and
wave
and
the
trumpets
sounding
to
advance
and
shields
and
helms
and
crests
and
chariots
mark
the
glorious
march
of
c√¶sar
soldiery
firing
the
gray
horizon
they
are
passed
and
like
a
gleam
of
glory
perishing
leave
but
a
name
behind
so
passes
man
an
armed
spectre
a
field
of
blood
and
vanishes
and
other
armed
shades
pass
by
red
battle
hurtling
as
they
pass
the
saxon
kings
have
strewed
their
palaces
from
thames
to
tyne
but
lo
the
sceptre
shakes
the
dane
remorseless
as
the
hurricane
that
sweeps
his
native
cliffs
harries
the
land
what
terror
strode
before
his
track
of
blood
what
hamlets
mourned
his
desultory
march
when
on
the
circling
hills
along
the
sea
the
shone
nightly
he
has
passed
now
frowns
the
norman
victor
on
his
throne
and
every
cottage
shrouds
its
lonely
fire
as
the
sad
curfew
sounds
yet
piety
with
energies
awoke
and
ampler
polity
in
woody
vales
in
unfrequented
wilds
and
the
towers
of
the
sequestered
abbey
shone
as
when
the
pinnacles
of
first
met
the
morning
light
the
parish
church
then
too
exulting
the
ruder
cross
upsprung
till
soon
the
distant
village
peal
flings
out
its
music
where
the
tapering
spire
adds
a
new
picture
to
the
sheltered
vale
uphill
thy
rock
where
sits
the
lonely
church
above
the
sands
seems
like
the
chronicler
of
other
times
there
left
to
tell
the
tale
but
issuing
from
the
cave
look
round
behold
how
proudly
the
majestic
severn
rides
on
to
the
sea
how
gloriously
in
light
it
rides
along
this
solitary
ridge
where
smiles
but
rare
the
blue
campanula
among
the
thistles
and
gray
stones
that
peep
through
the
thin
herbage
to
the
highest
point
of
elevation
the
vale
below
slow
let
us
climb
first
look
upon
that
flower
the
lowly
smiling
at
our
feet
how
beautiful
it
smiles
alone
the
power
that
bade
the
great
sea
roar
that
spread
the
heavens
that
called
the
sun
from
darkness
decked
that
flower
and
bade
it
grace
this
bleak
and
barren
hill
imagination
in
her
playful
mood
might
liken
it
to
a
poor
village
maid
lowly
but
smiling
in
her
lowliness
and
dressed
so
neatly
as
if
every
day
were
sunday
and
some
melancholy
bard
might
idly
musing
thus
discourse
to
it
daughter
of
summer
who
dost
linger
here
decking
the
thistly
turf
and
arid
hill
unseen
let
the
majestic
dahlia
glitter
an
empress
in
her
blazonry
of
beauty
let
the
stately
lily
shine
as
as
the
breast
of
the
proud
swan
sailing
upon
the
blue
lake
silently
that
lifts
her
tall
neck
higher
as
she
views
her
shadow
in
the
stream
such
ladies
bright
may
reign
unrivalled
in
their
proud
parterres
thou
wouldst
not
live
with
them
but
if
a
voice
fancy
in
shaping
mood
might
give
to
thee
to
the
forsaken
primrose
thou
wouldst
say
come
live
with
me
and
we
two
will
rejoice
nor
want
i
company
for
when
the
sea
shines
in
the
silent
moonlight
elves
and
fays
gentle
and
delicate
as
ariel
that
do
their
spiritings
on
these
wild
holts
circle
me
in
their
dance
and
sing
such
songs
as
human
ear
heard
but
cease
the
strain
lest
wisdom
and
severer
truth
should
chide
behind
that
windmill
sailing
round
and
round
like
days
on
days
revolving
bleadon
lies
where
first
i
pondered
on
the
sad
as
the
beneath
the
roof
of
its
secluded
parsonage
brean
down
emerges
the
edge
of
hutton
hill
just
seen
in
paler
light
and
weston
there
where
i
remember
a
few
cottages
sprinkling
the
sand
uplifts
its
tower
and
shines
as
if
in
conscious
beauty
the
scene
and
i
have
seen
a
far
more
welcome
sight
the
living
line
of
population
stream
children
and
village
maids
and
gray
old
men
stream
the
sands
to
church
such
change
has
been
in
the
brief
compass
of
one
hastening
life
and
yet
that
hill
the
light
is
to
my
eyes
familiar
as
those
sister
isles
that
sit
in
the
mid
channel
look
how
calm
they
sit
as
listening
each
to
the
tide
rocking
roar
of
different
aspects
this
abrupt
and
high
and
desolate
and
cold
and
bleak
uplifts
its
barren
brow
barren
but
on
its
steep
one
native
flower
is
seen
the
peony
one
flower
which
smiles
in
sunshine
or
in
storm
there
sits
companionless
but
yet
not
sad
she
has
no
sister
of
the
none
to
rejoice
with
her
when
spring
returns
none
that
in
sympathy
may
bend
its
head
when
evening
winds
blow
hollow
the
rock
in
autumn
gloom
so
virtue
a
fair
flower
blooms
on
the
rock
of
care
and
though
unseen
so
smiles
in
cold
seclusion
while
remote
from
the
world
flaunting
fellowship
it
wears
like
hermit
piety
one
smile
of
peace
in
sickness
or
in
health
in
joy
or
tears
in
summer
days
or
cold
adversity
and
still
it
feels
heaven
breath
reviving
steal
on
its
lone
breast
feels
the
warm
blessedness
of
heaven
own
light
about
it
though
its
leaves
are
wet
with
evening
tears
yonder
island
seems
not
so
desolate
nor
frowns
aloof
as
if
from
human
kind
the
lighthouse
there
through
the
long
winter
night
shows
its
pale
fire
and
three
forgotten
mounds
mark
the
rude
graves
none
knows
of
whom
but
those
of
men
who
breathed
and
bore
their
part
in
life
and
looked
to
heaven
as
man
looks
now
they
died
and
left
no
name
fancy
might
think
amid
the
wilderness
of
waves
they
sought
to
hide
from
human
eyes
all
memory
of
their
fortunes
till
the
trump
of
doom
they
rest
unknown
but
mark
that
hill
where
kewstoke
seems
to
creep
into
the
sea
thy
abbey
woodspring
rose
wild
is
the
spot
and
there
three
mailed
murderers
retired
to
the
last
point
of
land
there
they
retired
and
there
they
knelt
upon
the
ground
and
cried
bury
us
the
waves
where
none
may
know
the
whispered
secret
of
a
deed
of
blood
no
stone
is
those
graves
the
sullen
tide
as
it
flows
by
and
sounds
along
the
shore
seems
moaningly
to
say
pray
for
our
souls
nor
other
miserere
have
they
had
at
eve
nor
other
orison
at
morn
thou
hast
put
on
thy
mildest
look
thou
mighty
element
solemn
and
still
and
motionless
and
touched
with
softer
light
and
without
noise
lies
all
thy
long
expanse
thou
seemest
now
as
calm
as
if
a
child
might
dally
with
thy
playfulness
and
stand
the
weak
winds
lifting
gently
its
light
hair
upon
thy
margin
watching
one
by
one
the
long
waves
breaking
slow
with
such
a
sound
as
silence
in
her
dreamy
mood
might
love
when
she
more
softly
breathed
fearing
a
breath
might
mar
thy
placidness
oh
treachery
so
still
and
like
a
giant
in
his
strength
reposing
didst
thou
lie
when
the
fond
sire
one
moment
looked
and
saw
his
blithsome
boys
gay
on
the
sands
one
moment
and
the
next
and
bereft
by
the
same
surge
stood
in
his
desolation
for
he
looked
and
thought
how
he
had
blessed
them
in
their
sleep
and
the
next
moment
they
were
borne
away
snatched
by
the
circling
surge
and
seen
no
more
while
morning
shone
and
not
a
ripple
told
how
terrible
and
dark
a
deed
was
done
and
so
the
seas
were
hushed
and
not
a
cloud
marred
the
pale
moonlight
save
that
here
and
there
wandering
far
off
some
feathery
shreds
were
seen
as
the
sole
orb
above
the
lighthouse
held
its
course
in
loveliness
and
not
a
sound
came
from
the
distant
deep
save
that
at
times
amid
the
noise
of
human
merriment
the
ear
might
seem
to
catch
a
low
faint
moan
a
boding
sound
as
of
a
dying
dirge
from
the
sunk
rocks
while
all
was
still
beside
and
every
star
seemed
listening
in
its
watch
when
the
gay
to
erin
bound
resounding
with
the
laugh
and
song
went
on
look
she
is
gone
o
god
she
is
gone
down
with
her
company
gone
down
and
all
at
once
is
still
save
on
the
mast
just
peering
the
waters
the
wild
shrieks
of
three
at
times
are
heard
they
when
the
dead
were
round
them
floating
on
the
moonlight
wave
kept
there
their
dismal
watch
till
morning
dawned
and
to
the
living
world
were
then
restored
part
second
reflections
on
the
moral
and
religious
state
of
parishes
past
and
present
a
shower
even
while
we
gaze
steals
the
scene
shrouding
it
and
the
is
shout
out
save
where
beyond
the
holms
one
thread
of
light
hangs
and
a
pale
and
sunny
stream
shoots
on
the
dim
vapours
faint
and
far
away
like
hope
still
light
beyond
the
storms
of
time
come
let
us
rest
a
while
in
this
rude
seat
i
was
a
child
when
first
i
heard
the
sound
of
the
great
sea
was
night
and
journeying
far
we
were
belated
on
our
road
scenes
new
and
unknown
a
mother
and
her
child
now
first
in
this
wide
world
a
wanderer
my
father
came
the
pastor
of
the
church
that
crowns
the
high
hill
crest
above
the
sea
when
as
the
wheels
went
slow
and
the
still
night
seemed
listening
a
low
murmur
met
the
ear
not
of
the
winds
my
mother
softly
said
listen
it
is
the
sea
with
breathless
awe
i
heard
the
sound
and
closer
pressed
her
hand
much
of
the
sea
in
infant
wonderment
i
oft
had
heard
and
of
the
shipwrecked
man
who
sees
on
some
lone
isle
day
after
day
the
sun
sink
the
solitude
of
waves
like
crusoe
and
the
tears
would
start
afresh
my
mother
kissed
my
cheek
and
told
the
story
of
that
desolate
wild
man
and
how
the
speaking
bird
when
he
returned
after
long
absence
to
his
cave
forlorn
said
as
in
tones
of
human
sympathy
poor
robin
crusoe
thoughts
like
these
arose
when
first
i
heard
at
night
the
distant
sound
great
ocean
of
thy
everlasting
voice
where
the
white
parsonage
among
the
trees
peeped
out
that
night
i
restless
passed
the
sea
filled
all
my
thoughts
and
when
slow
morning
came
and
the
first
sunbeam
streaked
the
i
rose
unnoticed
and
with
stealthy
pace
straggling
along
the
village
green
explored
alone
my
fearful
but
adventurous
way
when
having
turned
the
hedgerow
i
beheld
for
the
first
time
thy
glorious
element
old
ocean
glittering
in
the
beams
of
morn
stretching
far
off
and
westward
without
bound
amid
thy
sole
dominion
rocking
loud
shivering
i
stood
and
tearful
and
even
now
when
gathering
years
have
marked
my
look
even
now
i
feel
the
deep
impression
of
that
hour
as
but
of
yesterday
spirit
of
time
a
moment
pause
and
i
will
speak
to
thee
dark
clouds
are
round
thee
but
lo
memory
waves
her
wand
the
clouds
disperse
as
the
gray
rack
disperses
while
we
gaze
and
light
steals
out
while
the
gaunt
phantom
almost
seems
to
drop
his
scythe
now
shadows
of
the
past
distinct
are
thronging
round
the
voices
of
the
dead
are
heard
and
lo
the
very
smoke
goes
up
for
so
it
seems
from
yonder
tenement
where
leads
the
slender
pathway
to
the
door
enter
that
small
blue
parlour
there
sits
one
a
female
and
a
child
is
in
her
arms
a
child
leans
at
her
side
intent
to
show
a
pictured
book
and
looks
upon
her
face
one
from
the
green
comes
with
a
cowslip
ball
and
one
a
hero
sits
sublime
and
horsed
upon
a
from
this
drives
his
tiny
without
on
the
green
whilst
one
apart
sighs
his
solemn
task
the
half
moody
half
in
tears
some
lines
of
thought
are
on
that
matron
brow
yet
placidness
such
as
resigned
religion
gives
is
there
mingled
with
sadness
for
who
beheld
without
one
stealing
sigh
a
progeny
of
infants
clustering
round
maternal
knees
nor
felt
some
boding
fears
how
they
might
fare
in
the
wide
world
when
they
who
loved
them
most
were
silent
in
their
graves
nay
pass
not
on
till
thou
hast
marked
a
book
the
leaf
turned
down
night
thoughts
on
death
and
immortality
this
book
my
mother
in
the
weary
hours
of
life
in
every
care
in
every
joy
was
thy
companion
next
to
god
own
word
the
book
that
bears
this
name
thou
didst
revere
leaving
a
stain
of
tears
upon
the
page
whose
lessons
with
a
more
emphatic
truth
touched
thine
own
heart
that
heart
has
long
been
still
but
who
is
he
of
aspect
more
severe
yet
with
a
manly
kindness
in
his
mien
he
who
yon
sturdy
labourer
delving
the
glebe
my
father
as
he
lived
that
father
and
that
mother
earth
to
earth
and
dust
to
dust
the
inevitable
doom
hath
long
consigned
and
where
is
he
the
son
whose
future
fate
they
pondered
with
a
sigh
long
nor
unprosperous
has
been
his
way
through
life
tumultuous
scenes
who
when
a
child
played
in
that
garden
platform
in
the
sun
or
loitered
the
common
and
pursued
the
colts
among
the
or
intent
on
hardier
enterprise
his
and
buoyant
with
its
tiny
sail
launched
on
the
garden
pond
or
stretched
his
hand
at
once
forgetting
all
this
glorious
toil
when
the
bright
butterfly
came
wandering
by
but
never
will
that
day
pass
from
his
mind
when
scarcely
breathing
for
delight
at
wells
he
saw
the
horsemen
of
the
clock
ride
round
as
if
for
life
and
ancient
blandifer
seated
aloft
like
hermes
in
his
chair
complacent
as
when
first
he
took
his
seat
some
hundred
years
ago
saw
him
lift
up
as
if
old
time
was
cowering
at
his
feet
solemn
lift
up
his
mace
and
strike
the
bell
himself
for
ever
silent
in
his
seat
how
little
thought
i
then
the
hour
would
come
when
the
loved
prelate
of
that
beauteous
fane
at
whose
command
i
write
might
placidly
smile
on
this
picture
in
my
future
verse
when
blandifer
had
struck
so
many
hours
for
me
his
poet
in
this
vale
of
years
himself
unchanged
and
solemn
as
of
yore
my
father
was
the
pastor
and
the
friend
of
all
who
living
then
the
scene
is
closed
now
silent
in
that
rocky
churchyard
sleep
the
aged
and
the
young
a
village
then
was
not
as
villages
are
now
the
hind
who
delved
or
jocund
drove
his
team
had
then
an
independence
in
his
look
and
heart
and
plodding
on
his
lowly
path
disdained
a
parish
dole
content
though
poor
he
was
the
village
monitor
he
taught
his
children
to
be
good
and
read
their
book
and
in
the
gallery
took
his
sunday
place
with
the
bee
to
work
so
passed
his
days
of
cheerful
independent
toil
and
when
the
pastor
came
that
way
at
eve
he
had
a
ready
present
for
the
child
who
read
his
book
the
best
and
that
poor
child
remembered
it
when
treading
the
same
path
in
which
his
father
trod
he
so
grew
up
contented
till
old
time
had
blanched
his
locks
and
he
was
borne
whilst
the
bell
tolled
to
sleep
in
the
same
churchyard
where
his
father
slept
his
daughter
walked
content
and
innocent
as
lovely
in
her
lowly
path
she
turned
the
while
the
humming
wheel
went
round
or
went
the
fields
in
spring
leading
her
little
brother
by
the
hand
along
the
village
lane
and
the
stile
to
gather
cowslips
and
then
home
again
to
turn
her
wheel
contented
through
the
day
or
singing
low
bend
where
her
brother
slept
rocking
the
cradle
to
sweet
william
grave
no
lure
could
tempt
her
from
the
woodbine
shed
where
she
grew
up
and
folded
first
her
hands
in
infant
prayer
yet
oft
a
tear
would
steal
down
her
young
cheek
to
think
how
desolate
that
home
would
be
when
her
poor
mother
died
still
praying
that
she
might
cause
a
pain
undutiful
to
bring
down
her
gray
hairs
with
sorrow
to
the
grave
now
mark
this
scene
the
fuming
factory
polluted
air
has
stained
the
country
see
that
rural
nymph
an
infant
in
her
arms
she
claims
the
dole
from
the
cold
parish
which
her
faithless
swain
denies
he
stands
aloof
with
clownish
leer
the
constable
behind
and
mark
his
brow
beckons
the
nimble
clerk
the
justice
grave
turns
from
his
book
a
moment
with
a
look
of
pity
signs
the
warrant
for
her
pay
a
weekly
eighteen
pence
she
unabashed
slides
from
the
room
and
not
a
transient
blush
far
less
the
accusing
tear
is
on
her
cheek
a
different
scene
comes
next
that
village
maid
approaches
timidly
yet
beautiful
a
tear
is
on
her
lids
when
she
looks
down
upon
her
sleeping
child
her
heart
was
won
the
was
fixed
the
ring
was
bought
is
the
same
story
colin
was
untrue
he
ruined
and
then
left
her
to
her
fate
pity
her
she
has
not
a
friend
on
earth
and
that
still
tear
speaks
to
all
human
hearts
but
his
whose
cruelty
and
treachery
caused
it
to
flow
so
crime
still
follows
crime
ask
we
the
cause
see
where
those
engines
heave
that
spread
their
giant
arms
all
the
land
the
wheel
is
silent
in
the
vale
old
age
and
youth
are
levelled
by
one
parish
law
ask
why
that
maid
all
day
toils
in
the
field
associate
with
the
rude
and
ribald
clown
even
in
the
shrinking
april
of
her
youth
to
earn
her
loaf
and
eat
it
by
herself
parental
love
is
smitten
to
the
dust
over
a
little
smoke
the
aged
sire
holds
his
pale
hands
and
the
deserted
hearth
is
cheerless
as
his
heart
but
piety
points
to
the
bible
shut
the
book
again
the
ranter
is
the
roving
gospel
now
and
each
his
own
apostle
shut
the
book
a
of
tracts
darken
its
light
and
choke
its
utterance
while
a
of
turn
where
we
will
have
drowned
the
small
still
voice
till
piety
sick
of
the
din
retires
to
pray
alone
but
though
abused
religion
and
the
dole
of
and
vomitories
huge
of
smoke
are
each
a
of
crime
polluting
far
and
wide
the
wholesome
air
and
withering
life
green
verdure
underneath
full
many
a
poor
and
lowly
flower
of
want
has
education
nursed
like
a
pure
rill
winding
through
desert
glens
and
bade
it
live
to
grace
the
cottage
with
its
mantling
sweets
there
was
a
village
girl
i
knew
her
well
from
five
years
old
and
upwards
all
her
friends
were
dead
and
she
was
to
the
workhouse
left
and
there
a
witness
to
such
sounds
profane
as
might
turn
virtue
pale
when
sunday
came
assembled
with
the
children
of
the
poor
upon
the
lawn
of
my
own
parsonage
she
stood
among
them
they
were
taught
to
read
in
companies
and
groups
upon
the
green
each
with
its
little
book
her
lighted
eyes
shone
beautiful
they
turned
her
form
was
graceful
but
her
book
her
sole
delight
instructed
thus
she
went
a
into
the
neighbouring
town
ah
who
shall
guide
a
friendless
maid
so
beautiful
and
young
from
life
contagions
but
she
had
been
taught
the
duties
of
her
humble
lot
to
pray
to
god
and
that
one
heavenly
father
eye
was
over
rich
and
poor
on
sunday
night
she
read
her
bible
turning
still
away
from
those
who
flocked
inflaming
and
inflamed
to
nightly
meetings
but
she
never
closed
her
eyes
or
raised
them
to
the
light
of
morn
without
a
prayer
to
him
who
bade
the
sun
go
forth
a
giant
from
his
eastern
gate
no
art
no
bribe
could
lure
her
steps
astray
from
the
plain
path
and
lessons
she
had
learned
a
village
child
she
is
a
mother
now
and
lives
to
prove
the
blessings
and
the
fruits
of
moral
duty
on
the
poorest
child
when
duty
and
when
sober
piety
impressing
the
young
heart
go
hand
in
hand
no
villager
was
then
a
disputant
in
calvinistic
and
contentious
creeds
no
pale
mechanic
from
a
neighbouring
sink
of
steam
and
rank
debauchery
and
smoke
crawled
forth
upon
a
sunday
morn
with
looks
saddening
the
very
sunshine
to
instruct
the
parish
poor
in
evangelic
lore
to
teach
them
to
cast
off
as
filthy
rags
good
works
and
listen
to
such
ministers
who
all
be
sure
are
worthy
of
their
hire
who
only
preach
for
good
of
their
poor
souls
that
they
may
turn
from
darkness
unto
light
and
above
all
fly
as
the
gates
of
hell
morality
and
baal
steeple
house
where
without
doctor
littlegrace
drones
his
dull
requiem
to
the
snoring
clerk
true
he
who
drawls
his
heartless
homily
for
one
day
work
and
plods
on
wading
stilts
through
prosing
paragraphs
with
inference
methodically
dull
as
orthodox
enforcing
sagely
that
we
all
must
die
when
god
shall
call
oh
what
a
pulpit
drone
is
he
the
blue
fly
might
as
well
preach
hum
and
so
conclude
but
save
me
from
the
sight
of
curate
fop
half
jockey
and
half
clerk
the
tommy
of
a
town
disdaining
books
omniscient
of
a
horse
impatient
till
september
comes
again
eloquent
only
of
the
pretty
girl
with
whom
he
danced
last
night
oh
such
a
thing
is
worse
than
the
dull
doctor
who
performs
duly
his
stinted
task
and
then
to
sleep
till
sunday
asks
another
homily
against
all
innovations
of
the
age
mad
missionary
zeal
and
bible
clubs
and
calvinists
and
evangelicals
yes
evangelicals
oh
glorious
word
but
who
deserves
that
awful
name
not
he
who
spits
his
puny
puritanic
spite
on
harmless
recreation
who
reviles
all
who
majestic
in
their
distant
scorn
bear
on
in
silence
their
calm
christian
course
he
only
is
the
evangelical
who
holds
in
equal
scorn
dogmas
and
dreams
the
shibboleth
of
saintly
magazines
decked
with
most
grim
and
godly
visages
the
cobweb
sophistry
or
the
dark
code
of
commentators
who
with
loathsome
track
crawl
a
text
or
on
the
lucid
page
beaming
with
heavenly
love
and
god
own
light
sit
like
a
nightmare
soon
a
deadly
mist
creeps
our
eyes
and
heart
till
angel
forms
turn
into
hideous
phantoms
mocking
us
even
when
we
look
for
comfort
at
the
spring
and
well
of
life
while
dismal
voices
cry
death
reprobation
woe
eternal
woe
he
only
is
the
evangelical
who
from
the
human
commentary
turns
with
tranquil
scorn
and
nearer
to
his
heart
presses
the
bible
till
repentant
tears
in
silence
wet
his
cheek
and
faith
and
hope
and
charity
with
radiant
smile
visit
his
heart
all
pointing
to
the
cross
he
only
is
the
evangelical
who
with
eyes
fixed
upon
that
spectacle
christ
and
him
crucified
with
ardent
hope
and
holier
feelings
lifts
his
thoughts
from
earth
and
cries
my
father
meantime
his
whole
heart
is
on
god
word
he
preaches
faith
and
hope
and
charity
these
three
and
not
that
one
and
charity
the
greatest
of
these
three
give
me
an
evangelical
like
this
but
now
the
blackest
crimes
in
code
are
moral
virtues
spare
the
prodigal
he
may
awake
when
god
shall
call
but
hell
roll
thy
avenging
flames
to
swallow
up
the
son
who
never
left
his
father
home
lest
he
should
trust
to
morals
when
he
dies
let
him
not
lay
the
unction
to
his
soul
that
his
upbraiding
conscience
tells
no
tale
at
that
dread
hour
bid
him
confess
his
sin
the
greater
that
with
humble
hope
he
looks
back
on
a
life
bid
him
confess
that
he
hath
broken
all
god
holy
laws
in
vain
hath
he
done
justly
loved
in
vain
mercy
and
hath
walked
humbly
with
his
god
these
are
mere
works
but
faith
is
everything
and
all
in
all
the
christian
code
contains
no
if
or
but
let
tabernacles
ring
and
churches
too
with
sanctimonious
strains
baneful
as
these
and
let
such
strains
be
heard
through
half
the
land
and
can
we
shut
our
eyes
and
sadly
wondering
ask
the
cause
of
crimes
when
infidelity
stands
lowering
here
with
open
scorn
and
such
a
code
as
this
so
baneful
withers
half
the
charities
of
human
hearts
oh
dear
is
mercy
voice
to
man
a
mourner
in
the
vale
of
sin
and
death
how
dear
the
still
small
voice
of
faith
that
bids
him
raise
his
look
beyond
the
clouds
that
hang
this
dim
earth
but
he
who
tears
faith
from
her
heavenly
sisterhood
denies
the
gospel
and
turns
traitor
to
the
cause
he
has
engaged
to
plead
come
faith
and
hope
and
charity
how
dear
to
the
sad
heart
the
consolations
and
the
glorious
views
that
animate
the
christian
in
his
course
but
save
oh
save
me
from
the
miss
who
trots
to
every
bethel
club
and
broods
some
black
missionary
monstrous
tale
reckless
of
want
around
her
but
the
priest
who
deems
the
almighty
frowns
upon
his
throne
because
two
pair
of
harmless
dowagers
whose
life
has
passed
without
a
stain
beguile
an
evening
hour
with
cards
who
deems
that
hell
burns
fiercer
for
a
saraband
that
thou
thou
my
sweet
shakspeare
thou
whose
touch
awakes
the
inmost
heart
of
virtuous
sympathy
thou
o
divinest
poet
at
whose
voice
sad
pity
weeps
or
guilty
terror
drops
the
dagger
from
his
palsied
hand
that
thou
art
pander
to
the
criminal
he
who
thus
edifies
his
christian
flock
moves
more
than
even
the
miss
my
pity
my
aversion
and
my
scorn
cry
aloud
oh
speak
in
thunder
to
the
soul
that
sleeps
in
sin
harrow
the
inmost
heart
of
murderous
intent
till
stand
upon
his
haggard
brow
call
conscience
up
like
a
stern
spectre
whose
dim
finger
points
to
dark
misdeeds
of
yore
wither
the
arm
of
the
oppressor
at
whose
feet
the
slave
crouches
and
pleading
lifts
his
fettered
hands
thou
violator
of
the
innocent
hide
thee
hence
hide
thee
in
the
deepest
cave
from
man
indignant
sight
thou
hypocrite
trample
in
dust
thy
mask
nor
cry
faith
faith
making
it
but
a
hollow
tinkling
sound
that
stirs
not
the
foul
heart
horrible
wretch
look
not
upon
the
face
of
that
sweet
child
with
thoughts
which
hell
would
tremble
to
conceive
oh
shallow
and
oh
senseless
in
a
world
where
rank
offences
turn
the
good
man
pale
who
leave
the
christian
sternest
code
to
vent
their
petty
ire
on
petty
trespasses
if
trespasses
they
are
when
the
wide
world
groans
with
the
burthen
of
offence
when
crimes
stalk
on
with
front
defying
the
land
whilst
her
own
cause
betraying
christian
zeal
thus
swallows
camels
straining
at
a
gnat
therefore
without
a
comment
or
a
note
we
love
the
bible
and
we
prize
the
more
the
spirit
of
its
pure
unspotted
page
as
pure
from
the
infectious
breath
that
stains
like
a
foul
fume
its
hallowed
light
we
hail
the
radiant
car
of
heaven
amidst
the
clouds
of
mortal
darkness
and
of
human
mist
sole
as
the
sun
in

oh
whilst
the
car
of

rolls
along
in

the

of
sin
and
sorrow
but
a
hellish
brood
of
imps
and
fiends
and
phantoms
ape
the
form
of
godliness
till
godliness
itself
seems
but
a
painted
monster
and
a
name
for
darker
crimes
at
which
the
shuddering
heart
shrinks
while
the
ranting
rout
as
they
march
on
mock
heaven
with

till

from
the
dismal
dream
look
up
oh
listen
to
the
apostolic
voice
that
like
a
voice
from
heaven
proclaims
to
faith
add
virtue
there
is
no
mistaking
here
whilst
moral
education
by
the
hand
shall
lead
the
children
to
the
house
of
god
nor
sever
christian
faith
from
christian
love
if
we
would
see
the
fruits
of
charity
look
at
that
village
group
and
paint
the
scene
surrounded
by
a
clear
and
silent
stream
where
the
swift
trout
shoots
from
the
sudden
ray
a
rural
mansion
on
the
level
lawn
uplifts
its
ancient
gables
whose
slant
shade
is
drawn
as
with
a
line
from
roof
to
porch
whilst
all
the
rest
is
sunshine
the
trees
in
front
the
village
church
with
pinnacles
and
light
gray
tower
appears
whilst
to
the
right
an
amphitheatre
of
oaks
extends
its
sweep
till
more
abrupt
a
wooded
knoll
where
once
a
castle
frowned
closes
the
scene
and
see
an
infant
troop
with
flags
and
drum
are
marching
that
bridge
beneath
the
woods
on
to
the
table
spread
upon
the
lawn
raising
their
little
hands
when
grace
is
said
whilst
she
who
taught
them
to
lift
up
their
hearts
in
prayer
and
to
remember
in
their
youth
god
their
creator
mistress
of
the
scene
whom
i
remember
once
as
young
looks
on
blessing
them
in
the
silence
of
her
heart
and
we
too
bless
them
oh
away
away
cant
heartless
cant
and
that
economy
cold
and
miscalled
political
away
let
the
bells
ring
a
puritan
turns
pale
to
hear
the
festive
sound
let
the
bells
ring
a
christian
loves
them
and
this
holiday
remembers
him
while
sighs
unbidden
steal
of
life
departing
and
departed
days
when
he
himself
was
young
and
heard
the
bells
in
unison
with
feelings
of
his
heart
his
first
pure
christian
feelings
hallowing
the
harmonious
sound
and
children
now
rejoice
now
for
the
holidays
of
life
are
few
nor
let
the
rustic
minstrel
tune
in
vain
the
cracked
resonant
of
mirth
though
humble
let
the
fiddle
scrape
its
merriment
and
let
the
joyous
group
dance
in
a
round
for
soon
the
ills
of
life
will
come
enough
if
one
day
in
the
year
if
one
brief
day
of
this
brief
life
be
given
to
mirth
as
innocent
as
yours
but
lo
that
ancient
woman
leaning
on
her
staff
pale
on
her
crutch
she
rests
one
withered
hand
one
withered
hand
which
gerard
dow
might
paint
even
its
blue
veins
and
who
is
she
the
nurse
of
the
fair
mistress
of
the
scene
she
led
her
tottering
steps
in
infancy
she
spelt
her
earliest
lesson
to
her
and
she
now
leans
from
that
open
window
while
she
thinks
when
summer
comes
again
the
turf
will
lie
on
my
cold
breast
but
i
rejoice
to
see
my
child
thus
leading
on
the
progeny
of
her
poor
neighbours
in
the
peaceful
path
of
humble
virtue
i
shall
be
at
rest
perhaps
when
next
they
meet
but
my
last
prayer
is
with
them
and
the
mistress
of
this
home
the
innocent
are
gay
gay
as
the
lark
that
sings
in
morn
first
sunshine
and
why
not
but
may
they
forget
as
life
steals
on
in
age
the
lessons
they
have
learned
in
youth
how
false
the
charge
how
foul
the
calumny
on
england
generous
aristocracy
that
wrapped
in
sordid
selfish
apathy
they
feel
not
for
the
poor
ask
is
it
true
lord
of
the
whirling
wheels
the
charge
is
false
ten
thousand
charities
adorn
the
land
beyond
thy
cold
conception
from
this
source
what
cottage
child
but
has
been
neatly
clad
and
taught
its
earliest
lesson
from
their
care
witness
that
schoolhouse
mantled
with
festoon
of
various
plants
which
fancifully
wreath
its
and
that
rustic
porch
whence
the
low
hum
of
infant
voices
blend
with
airs
of
spring
without
now
all
alive
the
green
sward
rings
with
play
among
the
shrubs
hushed
the
long
murmur
of
the
morning
task
before
the
pensive
matron
desk
but
turn
and
mark
that
aged
widow
by
her
side
is
god
own
word
and
lo
the
spectacles
are
yet
upon
the
page
her
daughter
kneels
and
prays
beside
her
many
years
have
shed
their
snow
so
silently
and
softly
down
upon
her
head
that
time
as
if
to
gaze
seems
for
a
moment
to
suspend
his
flight
onward
in
reverence
to
those
few
gray
hairs
that
steal
beneath
her
cap
white
as
its
snow
whilst
the
expiring
lamp
is
kept
alive
thus
feebly
by
a
duteous
daughter
love
her
last
faint
prayer
ere
all
is
dark
on
earth
will
to
the
god
of
heaven
ascend
for
those
whose
comforts
smoothed
her
silent
bed
and
thou
witness
elysian
tempe
of
stourhead
oh
not
because
with
bland
and
gentle
smile
adding
a
radiance
to
the
look
of
age
like
eve
still
light
thy
liberal
master
spreads
his
lettered
treasures
not
because
his
search
has
dived
the
druid
mound
illustrating
his
country
annals
and
the
monuments
of
darkest
ages
not
because
his
woods
wave
the
dripping
cavern
of
old
stour
where
classic
temples
gleam
along
the
edge
of
the
clear
waters
winding
beautiful
oh
not
because
the
works
of
breathing
art
of
poussin
rubens
rembrandt
gainsborough
start
like
creations
from
the
silent
walls
to
thee
this
tribute
of
respect
and
love
beloved
benevolent
and
generous
hoare
grateful
i
pay
but
that
when
thou
art
dead
late
may
it
be
the
poor
man
tear
will
fall
and
his
voice
falter
when
he
speaks
of
thee
and
witness
thou
magnificent
abode
where
virtuous
ken
with
his
gray
hairs
and
shroud
came
for
a
shelter
from
the
world
rude
storm
in
his
old
age
leaving
his
having
no
spot
where
he
might
lay
his
head
in
all
the
earth
oh
witness
thou
the
seat
of
his
first
friend
his
friend
from
schoolboy
days
oh
witness
thou
if
one
who
wanted
bread
has
not
found
shelter
there
if
one
poor
man
has
been
deserted
in
his
hour
of
need
or
one
poor
child
been
left
without
a
guide
a
father
an
instructor
and
a
friend
in
him
the
pastor
and
distributor
of
bounties
large
yet
falling
silently
as
dews
on
the
cold
turf
and
witness
thou
marston
the
seat
of
my
kind
honoured
friend
my
kind
and
honoured
friend
from
youthful
days
then
wandering
on
the
banks
of
rhine
we
saw
cities
and
spires
beneath
the
mountains
blue
gleaming
or
vineyards
creep
from
rock
to
rock
or
unknown
castles
hang
as
if
in
clouds
or
heard
the
roaring
of
the
cataract
far
off
beneath
the
dark
defile
or
gloom
of
ancient
forests
till
behold
in
light
foaming
and
flashing
with
enormous
sweep
through
the
rent
rocks
where
the
mist
of
spray
the
rainbow
like
a
fairy
in
her
bower
is
sleeping
while
it
roars
that
volume
vast
white
and
with
thunder
deafening
roar
comes
down
live
long
live
happy
till
thy
journey
close
calm
as
the
light
of
day
yet
witness
thou
the
seat
of
noble
ancestry
the
seat
of
science
honoured
by
the
name
of
boyle
though
many
sorrows
since
we
met
in
youth
have
pressed
thy
generous
master
manly
heart
witness
the
partner
of
his
joys
and
griefs
witness
the
grateful
tenantry
the
home
of
the
poor
man
the
children
of
that
school
still
warm
benevolence
sits
smiling
there
and
witness
the
fair
mansion
on
the
edge
of
those
chalk
hills
which
from
my
garden
walk
daily
i
see
whose
gentle
mistress
droops
with
her
own
griefs
yet
never
turns
her
look
from
others
sorrows
on
whose
lids
the
tear
shines
yet
more
lovely
than
the
light
of
youth
and
many
a
smiles
whose
flowers
invite
the
music
of
the
morning
bee
and
many
a
fireside
has
shot
out
at
eve
its
light
upon
the
old
man
withered
hand
and
pallid
cheek
from
their
benevolence
sad
as
is
still
the
home
who
shed
around
their
patrimonial
seats
the
light
of
charity
and
every
feeling
of
the
christian
heart
would
rise
accusing
could
i
pass
unsung
thee
fair
as
charity
own
form
who
late
didst
stand
beneath
the
porch
of
that
gray
fane
soliciting
a
mite
from
all
who
passed
with
such
a
smile
as
to
refuse
would
seem
to
do
a
wrong
to
charity
herself
how
many
blessings
silent
and
unheard
the
mistress
of
the
lonely
parsonage
dispenses
when
she
takes
her
daily
round
among
the
aged
and
the
sick
whose
prayers
and
blessings
are
her
only
recompense
how
many
pastors
by
cold
obloquy
and
senseless
hate
reviled
tread
the
same
path
of
charity
in
silence
taught
by
him
who
was
reviled
not
to
revile
again
and
leaving
to
a
righteous
god
their
cause
come
let
us
with
the
pencil
in
our
hand
portray
a
character
what
book
is
this
rector
of
overton
i
know
him
not
but
well
i
know
the
vicar
and
a
man
more
worthy
of
that
name
and
worthier
still
to
grace
a
higher
station
of
our
church
none
knows
a
friend
and
father
to
the
poor
a
scholar
unobtrusive
yet
profound
as
my
conversation
coped
withal
his
piety
unvarnished
but
sincere
killarney
lake
and
scotia
hills
have
heard
his
reed
nor
on
the
themes
of
hallowed
inspiration
has
his
harp
been
silent
though
ten
thousand
jangling
strings
when
all
are
poets
in
this
land
of
song
and
every
field
chinks
with
its
grasshopper
have
drowned
the
tones
but
poesy
mingles
at
eventide
with
many
a
mood
of
stirring
fancy
on
his
silent
heart
when
those
bleak
and
barren
downs
in
rain
or
sunshine
where
the
giant
wansdeck
sweeps
homewards
he
bends
his
solitary
way
live
long
and
late
may
the
old
villager
look
on
thy
stone
amid
the
churchyard
grass
remembering
years
of
kindness
and
the
tongue
eloquent
of
his
maker
when
he
sat
at
church
and
heard
the
undivided
code
of
apostolic
truth
of
hope
of
faith
of
charity
the
end
and
test
of
all
live
long
and
though
i
proudly
might
recall
the
names
of
many
friends
like
thee
sincere
and
pious
and
in
solitude
adorned
with
rare
accomplishments
this
grateful
praise
accept
congenial
to
the
poet
theme
for
well
i
know
haply
when
i
am
dead
and
in
my
shroud
thy
homeward
path
lies
those
hills
and
thou
shalt
cast
a
look
back
on
our
and
bremhill
tower
thou
wilt
remember
me
and
many
a
day
there
passed
in
converse
and
sweet
harmony
a
truce
to
satire
and
to
harsh
reproof
severer
arguments
that
have
detained
the
unwilling
muse
too
long
come
while
the
clouds
work
heavy
and
the
winds
at
intervals
pipe
and
at
intervals
sink
in
a
sigh
as
breathed
sounds
and
shadows
of
the
past
change
we
our
style
and
measure
to
relate
a
village
tale
of
a
poor
cornish
maid
and
of
her
it
is
sad
but
true
and
simply
told
though
not
in
lady
phrase
of
modish
song
may
touch
some
gentle
heart
and
wake
an
interest
when
description
fails
part
third
the
maiden
curse
i
subjoin
the
plain
narrative
of
the
singular
event
on
which
this
tale
is
founded
from
mr
polwhele
that
the
reader
may
see
how
far
i
have
departed
from
plain
facts
and
what
i
have
thought
it
best
to
add
for
the
sake
of
moral
picturesque
and
poetical
effect
the
narrative
is
as
follows
october
thomas
thomas
aged
this
man
died
of
mental
anguish
or
what
is
called
a
broken
heart
he
lived
in
the
village
of
drannock
in
the
parish
of
gwinnear
till
an
unhappy
event
occurred
which
proved
fatal
to
his
peace
of
mind
for
more
than
eight
years
and
finally
occasioned
his
death
he
courted
elizabeth
thomas
of
the
same
village
who
was
his
and
it
was
understood
that
they
were
under
a
matrimonial
engagement
but
in
may
some
little
disagreement
having
happened
between
them
he
out
of
resentment
or
from
some
other
motive
paid
great
attention
to
another
girl
and
on
sunday
the
of
that
month
in
the
afternoon
accompanied
her
to
the
methodist
meeting
at
wall
during
their
absence
the
slighted
female
who
was
very
beautiful
in
her
person
but
of
an
extremely
irritable
temper
took
a
rope
and
a
common
in
which
she
had
folded
down
the
psalm
and
going
into
an
adjacent
field
hanged
herself
thomas
on
his
return
from
the
preaching
inquired
for
betsy
and
being
told
she
had
not
been
seen
for
two
or
three
hours
he
exclaimed
god
she
has
destroyed
herself
which
apprehension
seems
to
show
either
that
she
had
threatened
to
commit
suicide
in
consequence
of
his
desertion
or
that
he
dreaded
it
from
a
knowledge
of
the
violence
of
her
disposition
but
when
he
saw
that
his
fears
were
realised
and
had
read
the
psalm
so
full
of
execrations
which
she
had
pointed
out
to
him
he
cried
out
am
ruined
for
ever
and
ever
the
very
sight
of
this
village
and
neighbourhood
was
now
become
insupportable
and
he
went
to
live
at
marazion
hoping
that
a
change
of
scene
and
social
intercourse
might
expel
those
excruciating
reflections
which
harrowed
up
his
very
soul
or
at
least
render
them
less
acute
but
in
this
he
appeared
to
be
mistaken
for
he
found
himself
closely
pursued
by
the
evil
demon
whose
torments
no
man
sure
but
lovers
and
the
damned
endure
to
hear
the
psalm
would
petrify
him
with
horror
and
therefore
he
would
not
attend
divine
service
on
the
day
of
the
month
he
dreaded
to
go
near
a
reading
school
lest
he
should
hear
the
dreaded
lesson
whatever
misfortunes
befel
him
and
these
were
not
a
few
for
he
was
several
times
hurt
and
even
maimed
in
the
mines
in
which
he
laboured
he
still
attributed
them
all
to
the
malevolent
agency
of
the
deceased
and
thought
he
could
find
allusions
to
the
whole
in
the
calamitous
legacy
which
she
had
bequeathed
him
when
he
slumbered
for
he
knew
nothing
of
sound
sleep
the
injured
girl
appeared
to
his
imagination
with
such
a
countenance
as
she
retained
after
the
rash
action
and
the
in
her
hand
open
at
the
hateful
psalm
and
he
was
frequently
heard
to
cry
out
my
dear
betsy
shut
the
book
shut
the
book
with
a
mind
so
disturbed
and
deranged
though
he
could
not
reasonably
expect
much
consolation
from
matrimony
yet
imagining
that
the
cares
of
a
family
might
distract
his
thoughts
from
the
miserable
subject
by
which
he
was
harassed
both
by
day
and
night
he
successively
paid
his
addresses
to
many
girls
of
marazion
but
they
indignantly
flew
from
him
and
with
a
sneer
asked
him
whether
he
was
desirous
of
bringing
all
the
curses
in
the
psalm
on
their
heads
at
length
however
he
succeeded
with
one
who
had
less
superstition
and
more
fortitude
than
the
rest
and
he
led
her
to
st
hilary
church
to
be
married
january
but
on
the
road
thither
they
were
overtaken
by
a
sudden
and
violent
hurricane
such
as
those
which
not
unfrequently
happen
in
the
vicinity
of
mount
bay
and
he
suspecting
that
poor
betsy
rode
the
whirlwind
and
directed
the
storm
was
convulsed
with
terror
and
was
literally
with
fear
such
is
the
power
of
conscious
guilt
to
impute
accidental
occurrences
to
the
hand
of
vindictive
justice
and
so
true
is
the
observation
of
the
poet
metuit
sibi
mens
mali
conscia
justum
he
lived
long
enough
to
have
a
son
and
a
daughter
but
the
corrosive
worm
within
his
breast
preyed
upon
his
vitals
and
at
length
consumed
all
the
powers
of
his
body
as
it
had
long
before
destroyed
the
tranquillity
of
his
mind
and
he
was
released
from
all
his
pangs
both
mental
and
corporeal
on
friday
october
and
buried
at
st
hilary
the
sunday
following
during
evening
service
oh
shut
the
book
dear
mary
shut
the
book
so
william
cried
with
wild
and
frantic
look
she
whom
he
loved
was
in
her
shroud
nor
pain
nor
grief
can
visit
her
sad
heart
again
there
is
no
sculptured
tombstone
at
her
head
no
rude
memorial
marks
her
lowly
bed
the
village
children
every
holiday
round
the
green
turf
in
summer
sunshine
play
and
none
but
those
now
bending
to
the
tomb
remember
mary
lovely
in
her
bloom
yet
oft
the
hoary
swain
when
autumn
sighs
through
the
long
grass
sees
a
dim
form
arise
that
hies
in
glimmering
moonlight
to
the
brook
its
wan
lips
moving
in
its
hand
a
book
so
like
a
bruised
flower
and
in
the
pride
of
youth
and
beauty
injured
mary
died
william
some
years
survived
but
years
no
trace
of
his
sick
heart
deep
anguish
could
erase
still
the
dread
spectre
seemed
to
rise
and
worse
still
in
his
ears
rang
the
appalling
curse
while
loud
he
cries
despair
upon
his
look
oh
shut
the
book
my
mary
shut
the
book
the
sun
is
slowly
westering
now
and
lo
how
beautiful
steals
out
the
humid
bow
a
radiant
arch
listen
whilst
i
relate
william
dread
judgment
and
poor
mary
fate
i
think
i
see
the
pine
that
heavily
swaying
yet
seems
as
for
the
dead
to
sigh
how
many
generations
since
the
day
of
its
green
pride
have
passed
like
leaves
away
how
many
children
of
the
hamlet
played
round
its
hoar
trunk
who
at
its
feet
were
laid
withered
and
gray
old
men
in
life
first
bloom
how
many
has
it
seen
borne
to
the
tomb
but
never
one
so
sunk
in
hopeless
woe
as
she
who
lies
in
the
cold
grave
below
her
from
which
at
church
she
prayed
was
her
poor
father
in
that
churchyard
laid
for
mary
grew
as
beautiful
in
youth
as
taught
at
church
the
lore
of
heavenly
truth
what
different
passions
in
her
bosom
strove
when
first
she
heard
the
tale
of
village
love
the
youth
whose
voice
then
won
her
partial
ear
a
yeoman
son
had
passed
his
twentieth
year
she
scarce
eighteen
her
mother
with
the
care
of
boding
age
oft
whispered
oh
beware
for
william
was
a
thoughtless
youth
and
wild
and
like
a
colt
unbroken
from
a
child
at
length
if
not
to
serious
thoughts
awake
he
came
to
church
at
least
for
mary
sake
young
mary
while
her
father
was
alive
saw
all
things
round
the
humble
dwelling
thrive
her
widowed
mother
now
was
growing
old
and
bit
by
bit
their
worldly
goods
were
sold
mary
remained
her
mother
hope
and
pride
how
oft
when
she
was
sleeping
by
her
side
that
mother
waked
and
kissed
her
cheek
with
tears
praying
for
blessings
on
her
future
years
when
she
her
mother
earthly
trials
should
rest
in
the
cold
grave
to
grieve
no
more
but
mary
to
love
dream
her
heart
resigned
and
gave
to
fancy
all
her
youthful
mind
shall
i
describe
her
didst
thou
never
mark
a
soft
blue
light
beneath
dark
such
was
her
eye
soft
light
her
chestnut
hair
light
as
she
tripped
waved
lighter
to
the
air
and
with
her
when
on
sunday
dressed
her
looks
a
sweet
but
lowly
grace
expressed
as
modest
as
the
violet
at
her
breast
sometimes
all
day
by
her
lone
mother
side
she
sat
and
oft
would
turn
a
tear
to
hide
where
winds
the
brook
by
yonder
bordering
wood
her
mother
solitary
cottage
stood
a
few
white
pales
in
front
fenced
from
the
road
the
and
poor
but
neat
abode
before
the
window
the
flowers
of
spring
a
hummed
whose
bees
were
murmuring
beneath
an
ivied
bank
abrupt
and
high
a
small
clear
well
reflected
bank
and
sky
in
whose
translucent
mirror
smooth
and
still
from
time
to
time
a
small
bird
dipped
its
bill
here
the
first
bluebell
and
of
livelier
hue
the
daffodil
and
polyanthus
grew
was
mary
care
a
jessamine
to
train
with
small
white
blossoms
round
the
a
rustic
wicket
opened
to
the
meads
where
a
scant
pathway
to
the
hamlet
leads
and
near
a
toiled
round
and
round
dashing
the
stream
with
long
continuous
sound
beyond
when
the
brief
shower
had
sailed
away
the
tapering
spire
shone
out
in
sunlight
gray
and
that
mountain
northern
point
to
sight
stretching
far
on
the
rolled
in
light
enter
within
see
everything
how
neat
one
book
lies
open
on
the
the
spectacles
are
on
a
leaf
of
job
there
mark
a
map
of
the
terrestrial
globe
and
opposite
with
its
prolific
stem
the
christian
tree
and
new
jerusalem
here
see
a
printed
paper
to
record
a
veritable
letter
from
our
lord
two
books
are
on
the
beneath
the
book
of
prayer
and
drelincourt
on
death
some
cowslips
in
a
cup
of
china
placed
a
painted
shelf
above
the
chimney
graced
grown
like
its
mistress
old
with
eyes
save
when
at
times
awaked
by
wandering
flies
tib
in
the
sunshine
of
the
casement
lies
was
spring
time
now
with
birds
the
garden
rung
and
mary
linnet
at
the
window
sung
whilst
in
the
air
the
vernal
music
floats
the
cuckoo
only
joins
his
two
sweet
notes
but
those
oh
listen
for
he
sings
more
near
so
musical
so
mellow
and
so
clear
not
sweeter
where
thy
mighty
waters
sweep
missouri
through
the
night
of
forests
deep
resounds
from
glade
to
glade
from
rock
to
hill
while
fervent
harmonies
the
wild
wood
fill
the
solitary
note
of
mary
old
mother
stops
her
wheel
to
say
the
cuckoo
hark
how
sweet
he
sings
it
is
not
long
not
long
to
whitsuntide
and
mary
then
shall
be
a
happy
bride
on
sunday
morn
when
a
slant
light
was
flung
upon
the
tower
and
the
first
peal
was
rung
william
and
mary
smiling
would
repair
arm
linked
in
arm
to
the
same
house
of
prayer
the
bells
will
sound
more
merrily
he
cried
and
gently
pressed
her
hand
at
whitsuntide
she
checked
the
rising
thoughts
and
hung
her
head
and
mary
ere
one
year
had
passed
was
dead
was
said
and
many
would
the
tale
believe
her
shrouded
form
was
seen
upon
that
eve
when
gliding
through
the
churchyard
they
appear
they
who
shall
die
within
the
coming
year
all
pale
and
strangely
piteous
was
her
look
her
right
hand
was
stretched
out
and
held
a
book
it
her
wet
hair
dripped
while
the
moon
cast
a
cold
wan
light
as
in
her
shroud
she
passed
i
can
not
say
if
this
were
so
but
late
she
went
to
to
learn
her
fate
what
there
she
heard
came
to
human
ears
but
from
that
hour
she
oft
was
seen
in
tears
mild
zephyr
breathes
the
butterfly
more
bright
strays
wavering
the
pales
in
rainbow
light
the
lamb
the
colt
the
blackbird
in
the
brake
seem
all
the
vernal
feeling
to
partake
the
lark
sings
high
in
air
itself
unseen
the
hasty
swallow
skims
the
and
all
things
seem
to
the
full
heart
to
bring
the
blissful
breathings
of
the
world
first
spring
how
lovely
is
the
sunshine
of
the
garden
bee
has
wound
his
earliest
horn
busied
from
flower
to
flower
as
he
would
say
up
mary
up
this
merry
morn
of
may
now
lads
and
lasses
of
the
hamlet
bore
branches
of
blossomed
thorn
or
sycamore
and
at
her
mother
porch
a
garland
hung
while
thus
their
rural
roundelay
they
sung
and
we
were
up
as
soon
as
day
to
fetch
the
summer
home
the
summer
and
the
radiant
may
for
summer
now
is
come
in
madern
vale
the
bloom
and
wave
to
zephyr
breath
the
cuckoo
sings
in
morval
coombe
where
nods
the
purple
heath
come
dance
around
tree
we
bring
a
garland
gay
and
mary
of
guynear
shall
be
our
lady
of
the
may
but
where
is
william
did
he
not
declare
he
would
be
first
the
blossomed
bough
to
bear
she
will
not
join
the
train
and
see
the
flower
she
gathered
now
is
fading
hour
by
hour
she
watched
the
sunshine
on
the
thatch
again
her
mother
turns
the
now
the
pane
the
westering
sun
has
left
the
long
so
mary
wore
in
hopes
and
fears
away
slow
twilight
steals
by
the
small
garden
gate
she
stands
oh
william
never
came
so
late
her
mother
voice
is
heard
good
child
come
in
dream
not
of
bliss
on
earth
it
is
a
sin
come
take
the
bible
down
my
child
and
read
in
sickness
and
in
sorrow
and
in
need
by
friends
forsaken
and
by
fears
oppressed
only
can
the
weary
heart
find
rest
her
thin
hands
marked
by
many
a
wandering
vein
her
mother
turned
the
silent
glass
again
the
rushlight
now
is
lit
the
bible
read
yet
ere
sad
mary
can
retire
to
bed
she
listens
hark
no
voice
no
step
she
hears
oh
seek
thy
bed
to
hide
those
bursting
tears
when
the
slow
morning
came
the
tale
was
told
need
it
have
been
that
william
love
was
cold
but
hope
yet
whispers
dry
the
accusing
tear
when
sunday
comes
he
will
again
be
here
and
sunday
came
and
struggling
from
a
cloud
the
sun
shone
bright
the
bells
were
chiming
loud
and
lads
and
lasses
in
their
best
attire
were
tripping
past
the
youth
the
child
the
sire
but
william
came
not
with
a
boding
heart
poor
mary
saw
the
sunday
crowd
depart
and
when
her
mother
came
with
kerchief
clean
the
last
who
tottered
homeward
the
green
mary
to
hear
no
more
of
peace
on
earth
retired
in
silence
to
the
lonely
hearth
next
day
the
tidings
to
the
cottage
came
that
william
heart
confessed
another
flame
that
with
the
bailiff
daughter
he
was
seen
at
the
new
tabernacle
on
the
green
that
cold
and
wayward
falsehood
made
him
prove
alike
a
traitor
to
his
faith
and
love
the
bells
are
ringing
it
is
whitsuntide
and
there
goes
faithless
william
with
his
bride
turn
from
the
sight
poor
mary
day
by
day
the
dread
remembrance
wore
her
heart
away
untimely
sorrow
sat
upon
her
cheek
and
her
too
trusting
heart
was
left
to
break
six
melancholy
months
have
slowly
passed
and
dark
is
heard
november
hollow
blast
sometimes
with
tearful
moodiness
she
smiled
then
still
and
placid
looked
as
when
a
child
or
raised
her
eyes
disconsolate
and
wild
oft
as
she
strayed
the
brook
green
marge
along
she
there
would
sing
one
sad
and
broken
song
lay
me
where
the
willows
wave
in
the
cold
moonlight
shine
upon
my
lowly
grave
sadly
stars
of
night
i
to
you
would
fly
for
rest
but
a
stone
a
stone
lies
like
lead
upon
my
breast
and
every
hope
is
flown
lay
me
where
the
willows
wave
in
the
cold
moonlight
shine
upon
my
lowly
grave
sadly
stars
of
night
her
mother
said
thou
shalt
not
be
confined
poor
maid
for
thou
art
harmless
and
thy
mind
the
air
may
soothe
as
fitfully
it
blows
whispering
forgetfulness
if
not
repose
so
mary
wandered
to
the
northern
shore
there
oft
she
heard
the
gaunt
tregagel
roar
among
the
rocks
and
when
the
tempest
blew
and
like
the
shivered
foam
her
long
hair
flew
and
all
the
billowy
space
was
tossing
wide
rock
on
thou
melancholy
main
she
cried
i
love
thy
voice
oh
sea
nor
heed
this
sad
world
while
i
look
on
thee
then
on
the
surge
she
gazed
with
vacant
stare
or
tripping
with
wild
fennel
in
her
hair
sang
merrily
oh
we
must
dry
the
tear
for
mab
the
queen
of
fairies
will
be
here
william
she
shall
know
all
and
then
again
her
ditty
died
into
its
first
sad
strain
lay
me
where
the
willows
wave
in
the
cold
moonlight
shine
upon
my
lowly
grave
sadly
stars
of
night
when
home
returned
the
tears
ran
down
apace
she
looked
in
silence
in
her
mother
face
then
starting
up
with
wilder
aspect
cried
how
happy
shall
we
be
at
whitsuntide
then
mother
i
shall
be
a
bride
a
bride
ah
some
dire
thought
seems
in
her
breast
to
rise
stern
with
terrific
joy
she
rolls
her
eyes
her
mother
heeded
not
nor
when
she
took
with
more
impatient
haste
her
sunday
book
she
heeded
not
for
age
had
dimmed
her
sight
her
mother
now
is
left
alone
is
night
mary
poor
mary
her
sad
mother
cried
mary
my
mary
but
no
voice
replied
next
morn
william
passed
along
and
careless
hummed
a
desultory
song
bound
to
st
ives
revel
not
a
ray
yet
streaked
the
pale
dawn
of
the
dubious
day
the
sun
is
yet
below
the
hills
but
look
there
is
the
tower
the
mill
the
stile
the
brook
and
there
is
mary
cottage
all
is
still
listen
no
sound
is
heard
but
of
the
mill
is
true
the
toils
of
day
are
not
begun
but
mary
always
rose
before
the
sun
still
at
the
door
a
leafless
relic
now
appeared
a
remnant
of
the
bough
no
in
the
window
tells
the
hours
where
is
poor
mary
where
her
book
her
flowers
ah
was
it
fancy
as
he
passed
along
he
thought
he
heard
a
spirit
feeble
song
struck
by
the
thrilling
sound
he
turned
his
look
upon
the
ground
there
lay
an
open
book
one
page
was
folded
down
spirit
of
grace
see
there
are
soils
like
on
the
place
it
is
a
soon
these
words
he
read
let
him
be
desolate
and
beg
his
bread
let
there
be
none
not
one
on
earth
to
bless
be
his
days
few
his
children
fatherless
his
wife
a
widow
let
there
be
no
friend
in
his
last
moments
mercy
to
extend
it
was
a
he
before
had
seen
where
when
once
more
wild
terror
on
his
mien
he
read
the
page
an
outcast
let
him
lie
and
unlamented
and
forsaken
die
when
he
has
children
may
they
pine
away
before
his
sight
his
wife
to
grief
a
prey
ah
is
poor
mary

the
very
same
he
read
with
her
at
church
and
lo

when
this
you
see
and
i
am
dead
and
gone
remember
me
he
trembles
mark
the
dew
is
on
his
brow
the
curse
is
hers
he
cried
i
feel
it
now
i
see
already
even
at
my
right
hand
dead
mary
thy
accusing
spirit
stand
i
feel
thy
deep
last
curse
then
with
a
cry
he
sunk
upon
the
earth
in
agony
feebly
he
rose
when
on
the
matted
hair
of
a
drowned
maid
and
on
her
bosom
bare
the
sun
shone
out
how
horrid
the
first
glance
of
sunlight
on
that
altered
countenance
the
eyes
were
open
but
though
cold
and
dim
fixed
with
accusing
ghastliness
on
him
merciful
god
with
faltering
voice
he
cries
hide
me
oh
hide
me
from
the
sight
those
eyes
they
glare
on
me
oh
hide
me
with
the
dead
the
curse
the
deep
curse
rests
upon
my
head
alas
poor
maid
was
frenzy
fired
thy
breast
which
prompted
horrors
not
to
be
expressed
whilst
ever
at
thy
side
the
foul
fiend
stood
and
laughing
pointed
to
the
oblivious
flood
william
to
despair
a
prey
soon
left
the
village
journeying
far
away
for
as
if
mary
ghost
in
judgment
cried
his
wife
in
the
first
pains
of
died
who
has
not
heard
st
cuthbert
of
thy
well
perhaps
the
spirit
may
his
fortunes
tell
he
dropped
a
pebble
mark
no
bubble
bright
comes
from
the
bottom
turn
away
thy
sight
he
looks
again
o
god
those
glare
how
terribly
ah
smooth
that
matted
hair
mary
dear
mary
thy
cold
corse
i
see
rise
from
the
fountain
look
not
thus
at
me
i
can
not
bear
the
sight
that
form
that
look
oh
shut
the
book
dear
mary
shut
the
book
meantime
poor
mary
in
the
grave
was
laid
her
lone
and
mother
wept
and
prayed
soon
to
the
dust
she
followed
and
unknown
there
they
both
rest
without
a
name
or
stone
the
village
maids
who
pass
in
summer
by
still
stop
and
say
one
prayer
for
charity
but
what
of
william
hide
me
in
the
mine
he
cried
the
beams
of
day
insulting
shine
earth
very
shadows
are
too
gay
too
bright
hide
me
for
ever
in
forgetful
night
in
vain
that
form
the
cause
of
all
his
woes
more
sternly
terrible
in
darkness
rose
nearer
he
saw
with
its
pale
waving
hand
the
phantom
in
appalling
stillness
stand
the
letters
of
the
book
shone
through
the
night
more
blasting
hide
oh
hide
me
from
the
sight
ocean
to
thee
and
to
thy
storms
i
bring
a
heart
that
not
the
music
of
the
spring
nor
summer
piping
on
the
rural
plain
shall
ever
wake
to
happiness
again
ocean
be
mine
wild
as
thy
wastes
to
roam
from
clime
to
clime
ocean
be
thou
my
home
some
say
he
died
here
he
was
seen
no
more
he
went
to
sea
and
oft
amid
the
roar
of
the
wild
waters
starting
from
his
sleep
he
gazed
upon
the
wild
tempestuous
deep
when
slowly
rising
from
the
vessel
lee
a
shape
appeared
which
none
besides
could
see
then
would
he
shriek
like
one
whom
heaven
forsook
oh
shut
the
book
dear
mary
shut
the
book
in
foreign
lands
in
darkness
or
in
light
the
same
dread
spectre
stood
before
his
sight
if
slumber
came
his
aching
lids
to
close
funereal
forms
in
long
procession
rose
sometimes
he
dreamed
that
every
grief
was
past
mary
long
lost
on
earth
is
found
at
last
and
now
she
smiled
as
when
in
early
life
she
lived
in
hope
that
she
should
be
his
wife
the
maids
are
dressed
in
white
and
all
are
gay
for
this
he
dreamed
is
mary
then
wherefore
sad
a
chill
comes
his
soul
the
sounds
of
mirth
are
hushed
and
hark
a
toll
a
slow
deep
toll
and
lo
a
sable
train
of
mourners
moving
to
the
village
fane
a
coffin
now
is
laid
in
holy
ground
that
heavily
returns
a
hollow
sound
when
the
first
earth
upon
its
lid
is
thrown
that
hollow
sound
now
changes
to
a
groan
while
rising
with
wan
cheek
and
dripping
hair
and
moving
lips
and
eyes
of
ghastly
glare
the
spectre
comes
again
it
comes
more
near
is
mary
and
that
book
with
many
a
tear
is
wet
which
with
dim
fingers
long
and
cold
he
sees
her
to
the
glimmering
moon
unfold
and
now
her
hand
is
laid
upon
his
heart
gasping
he
wakes
with
a
convulsive
start
he
gazes
round
moonlight
is
on
the
tide
the
passing
keel
is
scarcely
heard
to
glide
see
where
the
spectre
goes
with
frenzied
look
he
shrieks
again
oh
mary
shut
the
book
now
to
the
ocean
verge
the
phantom
flies
and
hark
far
off
the
lessening
laughter
dies
years
passed
away
at
night
or
evening
close
faint
and
more
faint
the
accusing
spectre
rose
restored
from
toil
and
perils
of
the
main
now
william
treads
his
native
place
again
near
the
upon
the
rudest
shore
where
from
the
west
atlantic
surges
roar
he
lived
a
lonely
stranger
sad
but
mild
all
marked
his
sadness
chiefly
when
he
smiled
some
competence
he
gained
by
years
of
toil
so
in
a
cottage
on
his
native
soil
he
dwelt
remote
from
crowds
nor
told
his
tale
to
human
ear
he
saw
the
white
clouds
sail
oft
the
bay
when
suns
of
summer
shone
yet
still
he
wandered
muttering
and
alone
at
night
when
like
the
tumult
of
the
tide
sinking
to
sad
repose
all
trouble
died
the
book
of
god
was
on
his
pillow
laid
he
wept
upon
it
and
in
secret
prayed
he
had
no
friend
on
earth
save
one
blue
jay
which
from
the
mississippi
far
away
the
atlantic
to
his
native
land
he
brought
and
this
poor
bird
fed
from
his
hand
in
the
great
world
there
was
not
one
beside
for
whom
he
cared
since
his
own
mother
died
yet
manly
strength
was
his
for
weighed
light
upon
his
frame
though
passed
in
tears
his
age
not
and
in
his
face
of
care
more
than
of
age
appeared
the
trace
mary
was
scarce
remembered
by
degrees
the
sights
and
sounds
of
life
began
to
please
ruth
was
a
widow
who
in
youth
had
known
griefs
of
the
heart
and
losses
of
her
own
she
patient
mild
compassionate
and
kind
first
woke
to
human
sympathies
his
mind
he
looked
affectionately
when
her
child
caressed
his
bird
and
then
he
stood
and
smiled
this
widow
and
her
child
almost
unknown
lived
in
a
cottage
that
adjoined
his
own
her
husband
was
a
fisher
one
whose
life
is
fraught
with
terror
to
an
anxious
wife
night
after
night
exposed
upon
the
main
returning
tired
with
toil
or
drenched
with
rain
his
gains
uncertain
as
his
life
he
knows
no
stated
hours
of
labour
and
repose
when
others
to
a
cheerful
home
retire
and
his
wife
sits
before
the
evening
fire
he
rocking
in
the
dark
tempestuous
night
haply
is
thinking
of
that
social
light
ruth
husband
left
the
bay
the
wind
and
rain
came
down
the
tempest
swept
the
howling
main
the
boat
sank
in
the
storm
and
he
was
found
below
the
rocks
of
the
dark
lizard
drowned
seven
years
had
passed
and
after
evening
prayer
to
william
cottage
ruth
would
oft
repair
and
with
her
little
son
would
sometimes
stay
listening
to
tales
of
regions
far
away
the
wondering
boy
loved
of
those
scenes
to
hear
of
battles
of
the
roving
buccaneer
of
the
wild
hunters
in
the
and
fires
and
dances
of
the
savage
men
so
william
spoke
of
perils
he
had
passed
of
voices
heard
amid
the
roaring
blast
of
those
who
lonely
and
of
hope
bereft
upon
some
melancholy
rock
are
left
who
mark
despairing
at
the
close
of
day
perhaps
some
vessel
sail
away
he
spoke
with
pity
of
the
land
of
slaves
and
of
the
that
rides
the
waves
it
comes
it
comes
a
melancholy
light
gleams
from
the
prow
upon
the
storm
of
night
is
here
is
there
in
vain
the
billows
roll
it
steers
right
on
but
not
a
living
soul
is
there
to
guide
its
voyage
through
the
dark
or
spread
the
sails
of
that
mysterious
bark
he
spoke
of
vast
how
they
float
for
many
a
rood
or
near
some
hurrying
boat
lift
up
their
tall
neck
with
a
hissing
sound
and
questing
turn
their
bloodshot
round
he
spoke
of
on
the
desert
rocks
who
in
the
sun
comb
their
green
dripping
locks
while
heard
at
distance
in
the
parting
ray
beyond
the
furthest
promontory
bay
a√´rial
music
swells
and
dies
away
one
night
they
longer
stayed
the
tale
to
hear
and
ruth
that
night
beguiled
him
of
a
tear
he
told
of
the
distressful
stroke
which
his
youth
suffered
then
she
pitying
spoke
and
from
that
night
a
softer
feeling
grew
as
calmer
prospects
rose
within
his
view
and
why
not
ere
the
long
night
of
the
dead
the
slow
descent
of
life
together
tread
the
day
is
fixed
william
no
more
shall
roam
william
and
ruth
shall
have
one
heart
one
home
the
world
shut
out
both
shall
together
pray
both
wait
the
evening
of
life
changeful
day
she
shall
his
anguish
soothe
when
he
is
wild
and
he
shall
be
a
father

her
child

at

such

let

the
redbreast
is
abroad
and
dripping
in
the
sunshine
sings
again
no
object
on
the
wider
meets
the
straining
vision
but
one
distant
ship
hanging
as
motionless
and
still
far
off
in
the
pale
haze
between
the
sea
and
sky
she
seems
the
ship
the
very
ship
i
saw
in
infancy
and
in
that
very
place
whilst
i
and
all
around
me
have
grown
old
since
she
was
first
descried
and
there
she
sits
a
solitary
thing
of
the
wide
main
as
she
sat
years
ago
yet
she
moves
on
all
may
be
one
waste
of
waves
where
is
she
bound
we
know
not
and
no
voice
will
tell
us
where
perhaps
she
beats
her
way
slow
up
the
channel
after
many
years
returning
from
some
distant
clime
or
lands
beyond
the
atlantic
oh
what
anxious
eyes
count
every
nearer
surge
that
heaves
around
how
many
anxious
hearts
this
moment
beat
with
thronging
thoughts
of
home
till
those
fixed
eyes
intensely
fixed
upon
these
very
hills
are
filled
with
tears
perhaps
she
wanders
on
on
on
into
the
world
of
the
vast
sea
there
to
be
lost
never
with
homeward
sails
destined
to
greet
these
hills
again
now
fading
into
mist
so
let
her
speed
and
we
will
pray
she
may
return
in
joy
when
every
storm
is
past
such
is
this
sea
that
shows
one
wandering
ship
how
different
smile
the
of
the
south
and
chiefly
thine
waters
of
loveliest
hampton
chiefly
thine
where
i
have
passed
the
happiest
hours
of
youth
waters
of
loveliest
hampton
thy
gray
walls
and
battlements
cast
the
same
shade
upon
the
light
blue
wave
as
when
of
yore
beneath
their
arch
king
canute
sat
and
chid
the
tide
that
came
regardless
to
his
feet
a
thousand
years
ago
oh
how
unlike
yon
solitary
sea
the
summer
shines
there
while
a
crowd
of
glancing
vessels
glide
filled
with
the
young
and
gay
and
pennants
wave
and
sails
at
distance
beautifully
swell
to
the
light
breeze
or
pass
like
butterflies
amid
the
smoking
steamers
and
oh
look
look
what
a
fairy
lady
is
that
yacht
that
turns
the
wooded
point
and
silently
streams
up
the
sylvan
itchin
silently
and
yet
as
if
she
said
as
she
went
on
who
does
not
gaze
at
me
yon
winding
sands
were
solitary
once
as
the
wide
sea
such
i
remember
them
no
sound
was
heard
save
of
the
warping
on
the
wind
or
of
the
surge
that
broke
along
the
shore
sad
as
the
seas
and
can
i
forget
when
once
a
visitor
from
oxenford
proud
of
wintonian
scholarship
a
youth
silent
but
yet
deeming
here
i
could
have
no
companion
fit
for
him
so
whispered
youthful
vanity
for
him
whom
oxford
had
distinguished
can
my
heart
forget
when
once
with
thoughts
like
these
at
morn
i
wandered
forth
alone
the
first
ray
shone
on
the
white
wing
and
gazing
round
i
listened
to
the
tide
advancing
roar
when
for
the
old
and
booted
fisherman
who
silent
dredged
for
shrimps
in
the
cold
haze
of
sunrise
i
beheld
or
was
it
not
a
momentary
vision
a
fair
form
a
female
following
with
light
airy
step
the
wave
as
it
retreated
and
again
tripping
before
it
till
it
touched
her
foot
as
if
in
play
and
she
stood
beautiful
like
to
a
fairy
of
the
deep
graceful
and
young
and
on
the
sands
alone
i
looked
that
she
would
vanish
she
had
left
like
me
just
left
the
abode
of
discipline
and
came
in
the
gay
fulness
of
her
heart
when
the
pale
light
first
glanced
along
the
wave
to
play
with
the
wild
ocean
like
a
child
and
though
i
knew
her
not
i
vowed
oh
hear
ye
votaries
of
german
sentiment
vowed
an
eternal
love
but
diffident
i
cast
a
parting
look
that
seemed
to
say
shall
we
meet
again
the
vision
smiled
and
left
the
scene
to
solitude
once
more
we
met
and
then
we
parted
in
this
world
to
meet
no
more
and
that
fair
form
that
shone
the
vision
of
a
moment
on
the
sands
was
never
seen
again
now
it
has
passed
where
all
things
are
forgotten
but
it
shone
to
me
a
sparkle
of
the
morning
sun
that
trembled
on
the
light
wave
yesterday
and
perished
there
for
ever
look
around
above
the
winding
reach
of
severn
stands
with
massy
fragments
of
forsaken
towers
thy
castle
solitary
walton
hark
through
the
lone
ivied
arch
was
it
the
wind
came
fitful
there
by
moonlight
we
might
stand
and
deem
it
some
old
castle
of
romance
and
on
the
glimmering
ledge
of
yonder
rock
above
the
wave
fancy
it
was
the
form
of
a
for
a
moment
seen
lifting
her
bloody
dagger
then
with
shrieks
vanishing
hush
there
is
no
sound
no
sound
but
of
the
severn
sweeping
onward
look
there
is
no
bleeding
apparition
there
no
fiery
phantoms
glare
along
thy
walls
surrounded
by
the
works
of
silent
art
and
far
far
more
endearing
by
a
group
of
breathing
children
their
possessor
lives
and
ill
should
i
deserve
the
name
of
bard
of
courtly
bard
if
i
could
touch
this
theme
without
a
prayer
an
earnest
heartfelt
prayer
when
one
whose
smile
i
never
saw
but
once
yet
can
not
well
forget
when
one
now
blooms
unlike
the
of
the
rock
a
living
and
a
lovely
bride
how
proud
opposed
to
walton
silent
towers
how
proud
with
all
her
spires
and
fanes
and
volumed
smoke
trailing
in
columns
to
the
midday
sun
black
or
pale
blue
above
the
cloudy
haze
and
the
great
stir
of
commerce
and
the
noise
of
passing
and
repassing
wains
and
cars
and
sledges
grating
in
their
underpath
and
trade
deep
murmur
and
a
street
of
masts
and
pennants
from
all
nations
of
the
earth
streaming
below
the
houses
piled
aloft
hill
above
hill
and
every
road
below
gloomy
with
troops
of
seated
high
on
their
rough
pads
in
dingy
dust
serene
how
proudly
amid
sights
and
sounds
like
these
bristol
through
all
whose
smoke
dark
and
aloof
stands
redcliff
solemn
fane
how
proudly
girt
with
villages
and
clifton
airy
rocks
bristol
the
mistress
of
the
severn
sea
bristol
amid
her
that
ancient
city
sits
from
out
those
trees
look
congresbury
lifts
its
slender
spire
how
many
woody
glens
and
nooks
of
shade
with
transient
sunshine
fill
the
interval
as
rich
as
poussin
landscapes
gnarled
oaks
dark
or
with
fits
of
desultory
light
flung
through
the
branches
there
the
road
where
sheltered
as
romantic
allures
the
lingering
traveller
to
wind
step
by
step
up
its
sylvan
hollow
slow
till
the
proud
summit
gained
how
gloriously
the
wide
scene
lies
in
light
how
gloriously
sun
shadows
and
blue
mountains
far
away
woods
meadows
and
the
mighty
severn
blend
while
the
gray
heron
up
shoots
and
screams
for
joy
there
the
dark
yew
starts
from
the
limestone
rock
into
faint
sunshine
there
the
ivy
hangs
from
the
old
oak
whose
upper
branches
bare
seem
as
admonishing
the
nether
woods
of
time
swift
pace
while
dark
and
deep
beneath
the
fearful
hollow
yawns
upon
whose
edge
one
peeping
cot
sends
up
from
out
the
fern
its
early
wreath
of
smoke
and
who
lives
in
that
cot
poor
dinah
she
was
once
a
most
beautiful
now
on
the
wild
wood
edge
she
lives
alone
alone
and
bowed
with
age
muttering
and
sad
and
scarce
within
the
sound
of
human
kind
forsaken
as
the
scene
nor
pass
we
fayland
with
its
fairy
rings
marking
the
turf
where
tiny
elves
may
dance
their
light
feet
twinkling
in
the
dewy
gleam
by
moonlight
but
what
sullen
demon
piled
the
rocks
that
stern
in
desolation
frown
through
the
deep
solitude
of
where
wheeling
its
crags
the
shrilling
kite
more
dismal
makes
its
utter
dreariness
but
yonder
at
the
foot
of
mendip
smiles
the
seat
of
cultivated
addington
and
there
that
beautiful
but
solemn
church
presides
the
still
scene
where
one
old
friend
lives
social
while
the
shortening
day
unfelt
steals
on
and
eve
with
smiling
light
descends
with
smiling
light
that
lingering
on
the
tower
reminds
earth
pilgrim
of
his
lasting
home
is
that
a
magic
garden
on
the
edge
of
mendip
hung
even
so
it
seems
to
gleam
while
many
a
cottage
on
to
wrington
smoke
wrington
the
of
immortal
locke
chequers
the
and
lowly
glens
with
porch
of
flowers
and
at
the
door
that
seems
to
say
england
with
all
thy
crimes
and
smitten
as
thou
art
by
england
thou
only
art
the
poor
man
home
and
yonder
blagdon
in
its
sheltered
glen
sits
pensive
like
a
in
its
cleft
the
craggy
glen
here
winds
with
ivy
hung
beneath
whose
dark
depending
tresses
peeps
the
there
fragments
of
red
rock
start
from
the
verdant
turf
among
the
flowers
and
who
can
paint
sweet
blagdon
and
not
think
of
langhorne
in
that
hermitage
of
song
langhorne
a
pastor
and
a
poet
too
he
in
retirement
literary
bower
oft
wooed
the
sisters
of
the
sacred
well
harmonious
nor
pass
on
without
a
prayer
for
her
associate
of
his
early
fame
accomplished
eloquent
and
pious
more
who
now
with
slow
and
gentle
decadence
in
the
same
vale
with
look
upraised
to
heaven
waits
meekly
at
the
gate
of
paradise
smiling
at
time
but
hark
there
comes
a
song
of
scotland
lakes
and
hills
auld
robin
gray
tweed
or
the
winding
tay
echoed
words
more
sadly
soothing
but
the
melody
like
some
sweet
melody
of
olden
times
a
ditty
of
past
days
rose
from
those
woods
oh
could
i
hear
it
as
i
heard
it
once
sung
by
a
maiden
of
the
south
whose
look
although
her
song
be
sweet
whose
look
and
life
are
sweeter
than
her
song
no
minstrel
gray
like
donald
and
the
lady
of
the
lake
but
would
lay
down
his
harp
and
when
the
song
was
ended
raise
his
lighted
eyes
and
smile
to
thank
that
maiden
with
a
strain
like
this
oh
when
i
hear
thee
sing
of
jamie
far
away
of
father
and
of
mother
and
of
auld
robin
gray
i
listen
till
i
think
it
is
jeanie
self
i
hear
and
i
look
in
thy
face
with
a
blessing
and
a
tear
i
look
in
thy
face
for
my
heart
it
is
not
cold
though
winter
frost
is
stealing
on
and
i
am
growing
old
those
tones
i
shall
remember
as
long
as
i
live
and
a
blessing
and
a
tear
shall
be
the
thanks
i
give
the
tear
it
is
for
summers
that
so
blithesome
have
been
for
the
flowers
that
all
are
faded
and
the
days
that
i
have
seen
the
blessing
lassie
is
for
thee
whose
song
so
sadly
sweet
recalls
the
music
of
lang
syne
to
which
my
heart
has
beat
part
fifth
lang
syne
vision
of
the
deluge
conclusion
the
music
of
lang
syne
oh
long
ago
it
died
away
died
and
was
heard
no
more
and
where
those
hills
that
skirt
the
level
vale
on
to
the
left
the
prospect
intercept
i
would
not
could
not
look
were
they
removed
i
not
not
look
lest
i
should
see
the
sunshine
on
that
spot
of
all
the
world
where
starting
from
the
dream
of
youth
i
gazed
long
since
on
the
cold
clouded
world
and
cried
beautiful
vision
loved
adored
in
vain
farewell
farewell
for
ever
how
sincere
how
pure
was
my
heart
love
oh
was
it
not
yes
heaven
can
witness
now
my
brow
is
changed
and
i
look
back
and
almost
seem
to
hear
the
music
of
the
days
when
we
were
young
like
music
in
a
dream
ere
we
awoke
oh
witness
heaven
how
fervent
how
sincere
how
fervent
and
how
tender
and
how
pure
was
my
fond
heart
first
love
the
summer
eve
shone
as
with
sympathy
of
sweet
farewell
upon
thy
tor
and
solitary
mound
glaston
as
rapidly
i
passed
along
borne
from
those
scenes
for
ever
while
with
song
the
sorrows
of
the
hour
and
way
beguiled
so
passed
the
days
of
youth
which
return
tearful
for
worldly
fortune
smiled
too
late
and
the
poor
had
then
no
wealth
save
such
as
poets
dream
of
love
and
hope
at
fortune
frown
the
wreath
which
hope
entwined
lay
withering
for
the
dream
had
been
too
sweet
for
human
life
yet
never
though
his
love
all
his
fond
love
he
muttered
to
the
winds
though
oft
he
strove
distempered
without
joy
to
drown
even
the
remembrance
that
he
lived
never
a
weak
complaint
escaped
his
lip
save
that
some
tender
tones
as
he
passed
on
died
on
his
desultory
lyre
no
more
forget
the
shadows
of
a
feverish
dream
that
long
has
passed
away
uplift
the
eyes
to
him
who
sits
above
the
water
flood
to
him
who
was
and
is
and
is
to
come
wrapped
in
the
view
of
ages
that
are
passed
and
marking
here
the
record
of
earth
doom
let
us
even
now
think
that
we
hear
the
sound
the
sound
of
the
great
flood
the
peopled
earth
covering
and
surging
in
its
solitude
let
us
forget
the
passing
hour
the
stir
of
this
tumultuous
scene
of
human
things
and
bid
imagination
lift
the
veil
spread
the
rolling
globe
four
thousand
years
the
vision
of
the
deluge
hark
a
trump
it
was
the
trump
of
the
archangel
stern
he
stands
whilst
the
awakening
thunder
rolls
beneath
his
feet
stern
and
alone
he
stands
upon
imaus
height
no
voice
is
heard
of
revelry
or
blasphemy
so
high
he
sounds
again
his
trumpet
and
the
clouds
come
deepening
the
world
why
art
thou
pale
a
strange
and
fearful
stillness
is
on
earth
as
if
the
shadow
of
the
almighty
passed
the
abodes
of
man
and
hushed
at
once
the
song
the
shout
the
cries
of
violence
the
groan
of
the
oppressed
and
the
deep
curse
of
blasphemy
that
scowls
upon
the
clouds
and
mocks
the
deeper
thunder
hark
a
voice
perish
again
the
thunder
rolls
the
earth
answers
from
north
to
south
from
east
to
west
perish
the
fountains
of
the
mighty
deep
are
broken
up
the
rushing
rains
descend
like
night
deep
night
while
momentary
seen
through
blacker
clouds
on
his
pale
death
a
gigantic
skeleton
rides
on
rejoicing
where
the
millions
of
mankind
visible
where
his
glared
welter
beneath
the
shadow
of
his
horse
now
dismally
through
all
her
caverns
hell
sends
forth
a
horrid
laugh
that
dies
away
and
then
a
loud
voice
answers
victory
victory
to
the
rider
and
his
horse
victory
to
the
rider
and
his
horse
ride
on
the
ark
majestic
and
alone
on
the
wide
waste
of
the
careering
deep
its
hull
scarce
peering
through
the
night
of
clouds
is
seen
but
lo
the
mighty
deep
has
shrunk
the
ark
from
its
terrific
voyage
rests
on
ararat
the
raven
is
sent
forth
send
out
the
dove
and
as
her
wings
far
off
shine
in
the
light
that
streaks
the
severing
clouds
bid
her
speed
on
and
greet
her
with
a
song
go
beautiful
and
gentle
dove
but
whither
wilt
thou
go
for
though
the
clouds
ride
high
above
how
sad
and
waste
is
all
below
the
wife
of
shem
a
moment
to
her
breast
held
the
poor
bird
and
kissed
it
many
a
night
when
she
was
listening
to
the
hollow
wind
she
pressed
it
to
her
bosom
with
a
tear
or
when
it
murmured
in
her
hand
forgot
the
long
loud
tumult
of
the
storm
without
she
kisses
it
and
at
her
father
word
bids
it
go
forth
the
dove
flies
on
in
lonely
flight
she
flies
from
dawn
till
dark
and
now
amid
the
gloom
of
night
comes
weary
to
the
ark
oh
let
me
in
she
seems
to
say
for
long
and
lone
hath
been
my
way
oh
once
more
gentle
mistress
let
me
rest
and
dry
my
dripping
plumage
on
thy
breast
so
the
bird
flew
to
her
who
cherished
it
she
sent
it
forth
again
out
of
the
ark
again
it
came
at
evening
fall
and
lo
an
plucked
off
and
in
its
bill
and
shem
wife
took
the
green
leaf
from
its
bill
and
kissed
its
wings
again
and
smilingly
dropped
on
its
neck
one
silent
tear
for
joy
she
sent
it
forth
once
more
and
watched
its
flight
till
it
was
lost
amid
the
clouds
of
heaven
then
gazing
on
the
clouds
where
it
was
lost
its
mournful
mistress
sung
this
last
farewell
go
beautiful
and
gentle
dove
and
greet
the
morning
ray
for
lo
the
sun
shines
bright
above
and
night
and
storm
have
passed
away
no
longer
drooping
here
confined
in
this
cold
prison
dwell
go
free
to
sunshine
and
to
wind
sweet
bird
go
forth
and
fare
thee
well
oh
beautiful
and
gentle
dove
thy
welcome
sad
will
be
when
thou
shalt
hear
no
voice
of
love
in
murmurs
from
the
leafy
tree
yet
freedom
freedom
shalt
thou
find
from
this
cold
prison
cell
go
then
to
sunshine
and
the
wind
sweet
bird
go
forth
and
fare
thee
well
and
never
more
she
saw
it
for
the
earth
was
dry
and
now
upon
the
mountain
van
again
the
great
archangel
stands
the
light
of
the
moist
rainbow
glitters
on
his
hair
he
to
the
bow
uplifts
his
hands
whose
arch
spans
the
whole
heaven
and
whilst
far
off
in
light
the
ascending
dove
is
for
a
moment
seen
the
last
rain
falls
falls
gently
and
unheard
amid
the
silent
sunshine
oh
look
up
above
the
clouds
borne
up
the
depth
of
light
behold
a
cross
and
round
about
the
cross
lo
angels
and
archangels
jubilant
till
the
ascending
pomp
in
light
is
lost
lift
their
acclaiming
voice
glory
to
thee
glory
and
praise
and
honour
be
to
thee
lord
god
of
hosts
we
laud
and
magnify
thy
glorious
name
praising
thee
evermore
for
the
great
dragon
is
cast
down
and
hell
vanquished
beneath
thy
cross
lord
jesus
christ
hark
the
clock
strikes
the
shadowy
scene
dissolves
and
all
the
visionary
pomp
is
past
i
only
see
a
few
sheep
on
the
edge
of
this
a√´rial
ridge
and
banwell
tower
gray
in
the
morning
sunshine
at
our
feet
farewell
to
banwell
cave
and
banwell
hill
and
banwell
church
and
farewell
to
the
shores
where
when
a
child
i
wandered
and
farewell
harp
of
my
youth
above
this
i
leave
thee
murmuring
to
the
fitful
breeze
that
wanders
from
that
sea
whose
sound
i
heard
so
many
years
ago
yet
whilst
the
light
steals
from
the
clouds
to
rest
upon
that
tower
i
turn
a
parting
look
and
lift
to
heaven
a
parting
prayer
that
our
own
zion
thus
with
sober
splendour
yet
not
gorgeous
her
mitred
brow
tempered
with
lenity
and
apostolic
mildness
in
her
mien
no
dark
defeature
beautiful
as
mild
and
gentle
as
the
smile
of
charity
thus
on
the
rock
of
ages
may
uplift
her
brow
majestic
pointing
to
the
spires
that
grace
her
village
glens
or
solemn
fanes
in
cities
calm
above
the
stir
and
smoke
and
listening
to
deep
harmonies
that
swell
from
all
her
temples
so
may
she
adorn
her
robe
as
graceful
as
her
creed
is
pure
this
happy
land
till
time
shall
be
no
more
and
whilst
her
gray
cathedrals
rise
in
air
solemn
august
and
beautiful
and
touched
by
time
to
show
a
grace
but
no
decay
like
that
fair
pile
which
from
hoar
mendip
brow
the
traveller
beholds
crowning
the
vale
of
avalon
with
all
its
towers
in
light
so
england
may
thy
gray
cathedrals
lift
their
front
in
heaven
pure
light
and
ever
boast
such
bland
but
yet
dignified
pious
paternal
and
beloved
as
he
who
prompted
and
forgives
this
severn
song
and
thou
o
lord
and
saviour
on
whose
rock
that
church
is
founded
though
the
storm
without
may
howl
around
its
battlements
preserve
its
spirit
and
still
pour
into
the
hearts
of
all
who
there
confess
thy
holy
name
peace
that
through
evil
or
through
good
report
they
may
hold
on
their
blameless
way
for
me
though
disappointment
like
a
morning
cloud
hung
on
my
early
hopes
that
cloud
is
passed
is
passed
but
not
forgotten
and
the
light
is
calm
not
cold
which
rests
upon
the
scene
soon
to
be
ended
i
may
wake
no
more
the
melody
of
song
on
earth
but
thee
father
of
heaven
and
saviour
at

with
lord
byron
having
recalled
my
attention
to
a
poem
sketched
some
years
ago
on
a
subject
of
national
history
i
have
been
induced
to
revise
and
correct
and
now
venture
to
offer
it
to
the
public
the
subject
though
taken
from
an
early
period
of
our
history
is
so
far
as
relates
to
the
grave
of
harold
purely
imaginary
as
are
all
the
characters
except
those
of
the
conqueror
and
of
edgar
atheling
history
i
think
justifies
me
in
representing
william
as
acting
constantly
under
strong
religious
impressions
a
few
circumstances
in
his
life
will
clearly
show
this
when
harold
was
with
him
in
normandy
he
took
an
oath
of
him
on
two
altars
within
which
were
concealed
miraculous
relics
his
banner
was
sent
from
rome
consecrated
by
the
pope
for
the
especial
purpose
of
the
invasion
of
england
without
adverting
to
the
night
spent
in
prayer
before
the
battle
of
hastings
was
not
this
impression
more
decidedly
shown
when
he
pitched
his
tent
among
the
dead
on
that
night
and
vowed
to
build
an
abbey
on
the
spot
the
event
of
the
battle
was
so
much
against
all
human
probability
that
his
undertaking
it
at
the
place
and
time
can
only
be
reconciled
by
supposing
that
he
acted
under
some
extraordinary
impression
when
the
battle
was
gained
he
knew
not
on
what
course
to
determine
instead
of
marching
to
london
he
retired
towards
dover
when
he
was
met
by
the
kentish
men
with
green
boughs
the
quaint
historian
says
he
was
these
and
many
other
incidental
circumstances
may
occur
to
the
reader
in
representing
him
therefore
as
under
the
control
of
superstitious
impressions
i
trust
i
have
not
transgressed
at
least
poetical
verisimilitude
an
earthquake
actually
happened
about
the
period
at
which
the
poem
commences
followed
by
storms
and
inundations
of
these
facts
i
have
availed
myself
i
fear
the
poem
will
be
thought
less
interesting
from
having
nothing
of
in
it
except
in
accordance
with
the
received
ideas
of
the
gentleness
of
atheling
character
i
have
made
him
not
insensible
to
one
of
my
imaginary
females
and
have
therefore
to
mark
his
character
made
him
advert
to
the
pastoral
scenes
of
scotland
where
he
had
been
a
resident
there
is
a
similarity
between
my
monk
and
the
missionary
but
their
offices
and
the
scenes
are
entirely
different
and
some
degree
of
resemblance
was
unavoidable
in
characters
of
the
same
description
filial
affection
love
of
our
country
bravery
sternness
inflexible
except
under
religions
fears
the
loftier
feelings
of
a
desolate
female
under
want
and
affliction
with
something
of
the
wild
prophetical
cast
religious
submission
and
deep
acquiescence
in
the
will
of
god
these
passions
are
brought
into
action
around
one
centre
if
i
may
use
the
word
the
grave
of
the
last
saxon
that
harold
sons
landed
with
a
large
fleet
from
denmark
and
were
joined
by
an
immense
confederate
army
in
the
third
year
of
william
reign
is
a
historical
fact
that
york
was
taken
by
the
confederate
army
and
that
all
the
normans
except
sir
william
malet
and
his
family
were
killed
is
also
matter
of
record
that
afterwards
the
blow
against
william
failing
the
whole
country
from
the
humber
to
tyne
from
the
east
to

west
was
depopulated
by
sword
and

facts

are
also
to
be

in
all
historians
some
slight
anachronisms
may
i

be
pardoned
if
anachronisms
they
are
such
as
the
year
in
which
the
tower
was
built
the
plan
of
the

will

found
i
trust
simple
and
coherent
the
characters
sufficiently
marked
and
contrasted
and
the
whole
conducive
however
deficient
in
other
respects
to

so
might
i
fondly
dream
when
the
cold
turf
is
heaped
above
my
head
and
carping
tongues
have
ceased
some
tones
old
england
thy
green
hills
might
then
remember
time
has
reft
the
shrine
where
the
last
saxon
canonized
lay
and
every
trace
has
vanished
like
the
light
that
from
the
eastern
window
fell
with
broken
sunshine
on
his
marble
tomb
so
have
they
passed
and
silent
are
the
choirs
that
to
his
spirit
sang
eternal
rest
and
scattered
are
his
bones
who
raised
those
walls
where
from
the
field
of
blood
slowly
conveyed
his
mangled
corse
with
torch
and
orison
before
the
altar
and
in
holy
earth
was
laid
yet
oft
i
muse
upon
the
theme
and
now
whilst
solemn
the
slow
curfew
tolls
years
and
dim
centuries
seem
to
unfold
their
shroud
as
at
the
summons
and
i
think
how
sad
that
sound
on
every
english
heart
smote
when
along
those
darkening
vales
where
lea
beneath
the
woods
of
waltham
winds
it
broke
first
on
the
silence
of
the
night
far
heard
through
the
deep
forest
phantoms
of
the
past
ye
gather
round
me
voices
of
the
dead
ye
come
by
fits
and
now
i
hear
far
off
faint
eleesons
swell
whilst
to
the
fane
the
long
procession
and
the
pomp
of
death
moves
visible
and
now
one
voice
is
heard
from
a
vast
multitude
harold
farewell
farewell
and
rest
in
peace
that
sable
car
bears
the
last
saxon
to
his
grave
the
last
from
hengist
of
the
long
illustrious
line
that
swayed
the
english
sceptre
hark
a
cry
is
from
his
mother
who
with
frantic
mien
follows
the
bier
with
manly
look
composed
godwin
his
and
adela
her
head
declined
her
hand
upon
her
brow
beneath
the
veil
supported
by
his
arm
sorrowing
succeed
lo
pensive
edmund
there
leads
wolfe
the
least
and
youngest
by
the
hand
brothers
and
sisters
silent
and
in
tears
follow
their
father
to
the
dust
beneath
whose
eye
they
grew
last
and
alone
behold
magnus
subduing
the
deep
sigh
with
brow
of
sterner
acquiescence
slowly
pace
the
sad
remains
of
england
chivalry
the
few
whom
hastings
field
of
carnage
spared
to
follow
their
slain
monarch
hearse
this
night
whose
corse
is
borne
beneath
the
escutcheoned
pall
to
rest
in
waltham
abbey
so
the
train
imagination
thus
embodies
it
moves
onward
to
the
abbey
western
porch
whose
windows
and
retiring
aisles
reflect
the
long
funereal
lights
twelve
stoled
monks
each
with
a
torch
and
pacing
two
and
two
along
the
pillared
nave
with
crucifix
aloft
begin
the
supplicating
chant
intoning
miserere
domine
now
the
stone
coffins
in
the
earth
are
laid
of
harold
and
of
leofrine
and
girth
brave
brethren
slain
in
one
disastrous
day
and
hark
again
the
monks
and
choristers
sing
pacing
round
the
requiem
eternam
dona
iis
to
his
grave
so
was
king
harold
borne
within
those
walls
his
bounty
raised
his
children
knelt
and
wept
then
slow
departed
never
in
this
world
perhaps
to
meet
again
but
who
is
she
her
dark
hair
streaming
on
her
brow
her
eye
wild
and
her
breast
she
beheld
at
distance
the
due
rites
nor
wept
nor
spake
and
now
is
gone
alas
from
that
sad
hour
by
many
fates
all
who
that
hour
had
met
were
scattered
godwin

in

a

to

the

like

to

with

the

heard
one
shout
conquest
or
death
as
now
the
sun
ascends
and
on
the
bastioned
walls
of
ravenspur
flings
its
first
beam
one
mighty
shout
is
heard
perish
the
norman
soldiers
on
to

on
the
humber
daughter
of

the

let
us
go
up
to

top
adela
cried
let
us
go
up
the
night
is
still
and
to
the
east
great
ocean
hum
is
scarcely
heard
if
but
a
wandering
step
or
distant
shout
or
dip
of
hastening
oar
or
tramp
of
steed
or
trumpet
break
the
hushed
horizon
we
can
catch
the
sound
when
breathless
expectation
watches
there
upon
the
platform
of
the
highest
tower
of
ravenspur
beneath
the
lonely
lamp
at
midnight
leaning
the
battlement
the
daughter
of
slain
harold
adela
and
a
gray
monk
who
never
left
her
side
watched
for
this
night
or
death
or
victory
the
saxon
standard
waits
hark
was
a
shout
and
sounds
at
distance
as
of
marching
men
no
all
is
silent
save
the
tide
that
rakes
at
times
the
beach
or
breaks
beneath
the
cliff
listen
was
it
the
fall
of
hastening
oars
no
all
is
hushed
oh
when
will
they
return
adela
sighed
for
three
long
nights
had
passed
since
her
brave
brothers
left
these
bastioned
walls
and
marched
with
the
confederate
host
to
york
they
come
not
have
they
perished
so
dark
thoughts
arose
and
then
she
raised
her
look
to
heaven
and
clasped
the
cross
and
prayed
more
fervently
her
lifted
eye
in
the
pale
shone
touched
with
a
tear
soft
airs
of
ocean
blew
her
long
light
hair
whilst
audibly
she
cried
preserve
them
blessed
mary
oh
preserve
my
brothers
as
she
prayed
one
pale
small
star
a
still
and
lonely
star
through
the
black
night
looked
out
like
hope
instant
a
trumpet
rang
and
voices
rose
and
hurrying
lights
appeared
now
louder
shouts
along
the
platform
peal
oh
they
are
normans
she
exclaimed
and
grasped
the
old
man
hand
and
said
yet
we
will
die
as
harold
daughter
and
with
mien
and
voice
firm
and
unfaltering
kissed
the
crucifix
they
knelt
together
and
the
old
man
spoke
all
here
is
toil
and
tempest
we
shall
go
daughter
of
harold
where
the
weary
rest
oh
holy
mary
is
the
clank
of
steel
up
the
stone
stairs
and
lo
beneath
the
lamp
in
arms
the
beaver
of
his
helmet
raised
some
light
hairs
straying
on
his
ruddy
cheek
with
breath
hastily
drawn
and
cheering
smile
young
atheling
the
saxon
banner
waves
oh
are
my
brothers
safe
cried
adela
speak
speak
oh
tell
me
do
my
brothers
live
atheling
answered
they
will
soon
appear
my
post
was
on
the
eastern
hills
a
scout
came
breathless
sent
from
edmund
and
i
hied
with
a
small
company
and
horses
fleet
at
his
command
to
thee
he
bade
me
say
even
now
upon
the
citadel
of
york
above
the
bursting
fires
and
rolling
smoke
the
saxon
banner
waves
i
thank
thee
lord
my
brothers
live
cried
adela
and
knelt
upon
the
platform
with
uplifted
hands
and
look
to
heaven
then
rising
with
a
smile
we
have
watched
i
and
this
old
man
here
hour
after
hour
through
the
long
lingering
night
and
now
is
almost
morning
i
will
stay
till
i
have
heard
my
brother
distant
horn
from
the
west
woods
but
you
are
weary
youth
oh
no
i
will
keep
watch
with
you
till
dawn
to
me
most
soothing
is
an
hour
like
this
and
who
that
saw
as
now
the
morning
stars
begin
to
pale
and
the
gray
twilight
steal
so
calmly
on
the
seas
and
world
could
deem
there
was
a
sound
of
misery
on
earth
nay
who
could
hear
thy
gentle
voice
fair
maid
and
think
there
was
a
voice
of
hate
or
strife
beneath
the
stillness
of
that
cope
above
us
oh
i
hate
the
noise
of
arms
here
will
i
watch
with
you
then
after
pause
poor
england
is
not
what
it
once
has
been
and
strange
are
both
our
fortunes
atheling
adela
answered
early
piety
hath
disciplined
my
heart
to
every
change
how
didst
thou
pass
in
safety
from
this
land
of
slavery
and
sorrow
he
replied
when
darker
jealousy
and
lowering
hate
sat
on
the
brow
of
william
england
mourned
and
one
dark
spirit
of
conspiracy
muttered
its
curses
through
the
land
was
then
with
fiercer
glare
the
lion
eye
was
turned
on
me
my
sisters
and
myself
embarked
the
wide
world
was
before
us
we
embarked
with
some
few
faithful
friends
and
from
the
sea
gazed
tearful
for
a
moment
on
the
shores
we
left
for
ever
so
it
then
appeared
poor
margaret
hid
her
face
but
the
fresh
wind
swelled
the
broad
mainsail
and
the
lessening
land
the
towers
the
spires
the
villages
the
smoke
were
seen
no
more
when
now
at
sea
the
winds
blew
adverse
for
to
holland
was
our
course
more
fearful
rose
the
storm
the
east
wind
sang
louder
till
wrecked
upon
the
shores
of
forth
our
vessel
lay
here
friendless
we
implored
a
short
sojourn
and
succour
scotland
king
then
sat
in
dunfermline
he
heard
the
tale
of
our
distress
and
flew
himself
to
save
but
when
he
saw
my
sister
margaret
young
innocent
and
beautiful
in
tears
his
heart
was
moved
oh
welcome
here
he
cried
is
heaven
hath
led
you
lady
look
on
me
if
such
a
flower
be
cast
to
the
bleak
winds
meet
i
took
and
wore
it
next
my
heart
judged
he
not
well
fair
maid
thou
the
rest
compassion
nurtured
love
and
margaret
such
are
the
events
of
ruling
providence
is
now
all
scotland
queen
to
join
the
bands
of
warriors
in
one
cause
assembled
here
king
malcolm
left
his
land
of
hills
his
arm
might
make
the
conqueror
tremble
on
his
throne
even
should
we
fail
my
sister
margaret
would
love
and
honour
you
and
i
might
hope
oh
might
i
on
the
banks
of
tay
or
tweed
with
thee
to
wander
where
no
curfew
sounds
and
mark
the
summer
sun
beyond
the
hills
sink
in
its
glory
and
then
hand
in
hand
wind
through
the
woods
and
adela
replied
with
smile
complacent
listen
i
will
be
so
to
beguile
the
creeping
hours
of
time
a
two
years
we
held
sojourn
in
denmark
two
long
weary
years
and
sighed
when
looking
on
the
southern
deep
we
thought
of
our
poor
country
give
me
men
and
ships
godwin
still
cried
oh
give
me
men
and
ships
the
king
commanded
and
his
armament
a
mightier
never
stemmed
the
baltic
deep
sent
forth
by
of
the
north
or
bent
on
hardier
enterprise
for
not
some
isle
of
the
lone
orcades
was
now
the
prize
but
england
throne
his
mighty
armament
now
left
the
shores
of
denmark
our
brave
ships
burst
through
the
baltic
straits
how
gloriously
i
heard
the
trumpets
ring
i
saw
the
sails
of
nigh
three
hundred
the
dim
verge
of
the
remote
horizon
skiey
track
bestudding
here
and
there
like
gems
of
light
dropped
from
the
radiance
of
the
morning
sun
on
the
gray
waste
of
waters
so
our
ships
swept
the
billows
of
the
north
and
steered
right
on
to
england
foremost
of
the
fleet
our
gallant
vessel
rode
around
the
mast
emblazoned
shields
were
ranged
and
plumed
crests
shook
as
the
rose
upon
the
prow
more
ardent
godwin
my
brave
brother
stood
and
milder
edmund
on
whose
mailed
arm
i
hung
when
the
white
waves
before
us
swelled
and
parted
the
broad
banner
in
full
length
streamed
out
its
folds
on
which
the
saxon
horse
ramped
as
impatient
on
the
land
to
leap
to
which
the
winds
still
bore
it
bravely
on
whilst
the
red
cross
on
the
front
banner
shone
the
hoar
deep
crimsoning
winds
bear
us
on
bear
us
as
cheerily
till
white
albion
cliffs
resound
to
our
triumphant
shouts
till
there
on
his
own
tower
that
frowns
above
the
thames
even
there
we
plant
these
banners
and
this
cross
and
stamp
the
conqueror
and
his
crown
to
dust
they
would
have
kept
me
on
a
foreign
shore
but
could
i
leave
my
brothers
i
with
them
grew
up
with
them
i
left
my
native
land
with
them
all
perils
have
i
braved
of
sea
or
war
all
storms
of
hard
adversity
let
death
betide
i
reck
not
all
i
ask
is
yet
once
more
in
this
sad
world
to
kneel
upon
my
father
grave
and
kiss
the
earth
when
the
fourth
morning
gleamed
along
the
deep
england
old
england
burst
the
general
cry
england
old
england
every
eye
intent
was
turned
and
godwin
pointed
with
his
sword
to
flamborough
pale
rising
the
surge
nearer
into
the
kingdom
heart
bear
on
the
of
our
vengeance
godwin
cried
soon
like
a
cloud
the
northern
foreland
rose
know
ye
those
cliffs
towering
in
giant
state
but
hark
along
the
shores
ring
out
more
loud
blast
answers
blast
the
swords
of
hurrying
horsemen
and
projected
spears
flash
to
the
sun
on
yonder
castle
walls
a
thousand
bows
are
bent
again
our
course
back
to
the
north
is
turned
now
twilight
veiled
the
sinking
sands
of
yarmouth
and
we
heard
a
long
deep
toll
from
many
a
village
tower
on
shore
and
lo
the
scattered
inland
lights
that
sprinkled
winding
ocean
lowly
verge
at
once
are
lost
in
darkness
god
in
heaven
it
is
the
curfew
godwin
cried
and
smote
his
forehead
we
all
heard
that
sullen
sound
for
the
first
time
that
night
but
the
winds
blew
our
ship
sailed
out
of
hearing
yet
we
thought
of
the
poor
mother
who
on
winter
nights
when
her
belated
husband
from
the
wood
was
not
come
back
her
lonely
taper
lit
and
turned
the
glass
and
saw
the
shine
on
the
faces
of
her
little
ones
those
times
will
return
darkness
descends
again
the
sun
is
rising
the
waves
and
now
hoarse
humber
roars
beneath
our
keels
and
we
have
landed
yea
and
struck
a
blow
such
as
may
make
the
crowned
conqueror
quail
edgar
replied
grant
heaven
that
we
may
live
adela
cried
in
love
and
peace
again
when
every
storm
is
past
but
this
good
man
is
silent
ailric
does
no
hope
even
now
arise
on
thy
dark
heart
good
father
speak
with
aspect
mild
on
which
its
fitful
light
the
lamp
threw
pale
the
monk
replied
youth
on
thy
light
hair
and
ingenuous
brow
most
comely
sits
the
morn
of
life
on
me
and
this
bare
head
the
night
of
time
descends
in
sorrow
i
look
back
upon
the
past
and
think
of
joy
and
sadness
upon
earth
like
the
vast
ocean
fluctuating
toil
from
everlasting
i
have
seen
its
waste
now
in
the
sunshine
sleeping
now
with
storms
and
such
the
kingdoms
of
the
earth
yes
youth
and
flattering
fortune
and
the
light
of
summer
days
are
as
the
radiance
that
flits
along
the
solitary
waves
even
whilst
we
gaze
and
say
how
beautiful
so
fitful
and
so
perishing
the
dream
of
human
things
but
there
is
light
above
undying
and
at
times
faint
harmonies
heard
by
the
weary
pilgrim
in
his
way
perilous
rocks
and
through
unwatered
wastes
who
looks
up
fainting
and
prays
earnestly
to
pass
into
that
rest
whence
sounds
so
sweet
come
whispering
of
hope
else
it
were
best
beneath
the
load
the
forlorn
heart
endures
to
sink
at
once
to
shut
the
eyes
on
things
that
sear
the
sight
and
so
to
wrap
the
soul
in
sullen
tearless
ruthless
apathy
therefore
every
human
change
i
drop
a
tear
upon
the
cross
and
all
is
calm
yea
full
of
blissful
and
of
brightest
views
on
this
dark
tide
of
time
youth
thou
hast
known
adversity
even
in
thy
morn
of
life
the
springtide
rainbow
fades
and
many
days
and
many
years
perchance
of
weal
or
woe
hang
thee
happy
if
through
every
change
thy
constant
heart
thy
steadfast
view
be
fixed
upon
that
better
kingdom
where
the
crown
immortal
is
held
out
to
holy
hope
beyond
the
clouds
that
rest
upon
the
grave
oh
i
remember
when
king
harold
stood
blooming
in
youth
like
thee
i
saw
him
crowned
i
heard
the
loud
voice
of
a
nation
hail
his
rising
star
then
flaming
in
the
red
portentous
comet
like
the
hand
upon
the
wall
came
forth
its
fatal
course
all
marked
and
gazed
in
terror
as
it
looked
with
lurid
light
upon
this
land
it
passed
old
men
had
many
bodings
but
i
saw
reckless
king
harold
in
his
plumed
helm
ride
foremost
of
the
mailed
chivalry
that
when
the
fierce
norwegian
passed
the
seas
met
his
host
man
to
man
i
saw
the
sword
advanced
and
glittering
in
the
victor
hand
that
smote
the
hardrada
to
the
earth
king
harold
rose
like
an
avenging
god
so
it
seemed
so
short
the
space
through
the
field
of
blood
we
sought
his
mangled
corse
amid
the
heaps
of
slain
shall
i
recount
the
event
more
faithfully
its
spectred
memory
never
since
that
hour
has
left
my
heart
william
was
in
his
tent
spread
on
the
on
that
same
night
when
seventy
thousand
dead
lay
at
his
feet
they
who
at
sunrise
with
bent
bows
and
spears
confronted
and
defied
him
at
his
feet
lay
dead
alone
he
watches
in
his
tent
at
midnight
a
sight
so
terrible
we
came
we
stood
before
him
where
he
sat
i
and
my
brother
osgood
who
are
ye
sternly
he
asked
and
osgood
thus
replied
conqueror
and
lord
and
soon
to
be
a
king
we
two
poor
monks
of
waltham
abbey
kneel
before
thee
sorrowing
he
who
is
slain
to
us
was
bountiful
he
raised
those
walls
where
we
devote
our
life
to
prayer
and
praise
oh
by
the
mercies
which
the
god
of
all
hath
shewn
to
thee
this
day
grant
our
request
to
search
for
his
dead
body
through
this
field
of
terror
that
his
bones
may
rest
with
us
your
king
hath
met
the
meed
of
broken
faith
william
replied
but
yet
he
shall
not
want
a
sepulchre
and
on
this
very
spot
my
purpose
stands
as
i
have
vowed
to
god
to
build
a
holy
monastery
here
a
hundred
monks
shall
pray
for
all
who
fell
in
this
dread
strife
and
your
king
harold
here
shall
have
due
honours
and
a
stately
tomb
still
on
our
knees
we
answered
oh
not
so
dread
sovereign
hear
us
of
your
clemency
we
beg
his
body
beg
it
for
the
sake
of
our
successors
beg
it
for
ourselves
that
we
may
bury
it
in
the
same
spot
himself
ordained
when
living
where
the
choirs
may
sing
for
his
repose
in
distant
years
when
we
are
dust
and
ashes
then
go
forth
and
search
for
him
at
the
first
dawn
of
day
king
william
said
we
crossed
our
breasts
and
passed
slow
rising
from
his
presence
so
we
went
in
silence
to
the
quarry
of
the
dead
the
sun
rose
on
that
still
and
dismal
host
toiling
from
corse
to
corse
we
trod
in
blood
from
morn
till
noon
toiling
and
then
i
said
seek
editha
her
whom
he
loved
she
came
and
through
the
field
of
death
she
passed
she
looked
on
many
a
face
ghastly
upturned
her
hand
unloosed
the
helmet
smoothed
the
clotted
hair
and
many
livid
hands
she
took
in
hers
till
stooping
a
mangled
corse
she
shrieked
then
into
tears
burst
audibly
and
turned
her
face
and
with
a
faltering
voice
pronounced
oh
harold
we
took
up
and
bore
the
corse
from
that
sad
spot
and
washed
the
ghastly
wound
deep
in
the
forehead
where
the
broken
barb
was
fixed
so
weltering
from
the
field
we
bore
king
harold
corse
a
hundred
norman
knights
met
the
sad
train
with
pikes
that
trailed
the
ground
our
old
men
prayed
and
spoke
of
evil
days
to
come
the
women
smote
their
breasts
and
wept
the
little
children
knelt
beside
the
way
as
on
to
waltham
the
funereal
car
moved
slow
few
and
disconsolate
the
train
of
english
earls
for
few
alas
remained
so
many
in
the
field
of
death
lay
cold
the
horses
slowly
paced
till
waltham
towers
before
us
rose
there
with
long
tapered
blaze
our
brethren
met
us
chanting
two
and
two
the
miserere
of
the
dead
and
there
but
my
child
adela
you
are
in
tears
there
at
the
foot
of
the
high
altar
lies
the
last
of
saxon
kings
sad
editha
at
distance
watched
the
rites
and
from
that
hour
we
never
saw
her
more
a
distant
trump
now
rung
again
again
and
thrice
a
trump
has
answered
from
the
walls
of
ravenspur
my
brothers
they
are
here
adela
cried
and
left
the
tower
in
breathless
ardour
york
flames
to
the
sky
a
general
voice
was
heard
the
drawbridge
clanks
into
the
inner
court
a
mailed
man
rides
on
york
is
no
more
the
cry
without
redoubles
on
the
ground
the
rider
flung
his
bloody
sword
and
raised
his
helm
dismounting
the
first
dawn
of
day
gleamed
on
the
shattered
plume
oh
adela
he
cried
your
brother
godwin
and
she
flew
and
murmuring
my
brave
brother
hid
her
face
clasping
his
mailed
breast
soon
gazing
round
she
cried
but
where
is
edmund
was
he
wont
to
linger
edmund
has
a
sacred
charge
godwin
replied
but
trust
his
anxious
love
we
soon
shall
hear
his
voice
i
need
some
rest
is
now
broad
day
but
we
have
watched
and
fought
i
can
sleep
sound
though
the
shrill
bird
of
morn
mount
and
upbraid
my
slumbers
with
her
song
tranquil
and
clear
the
autumnal
day
declined
the
barks
at
anchor
cast
their
lengthened
shades
on
the
gray
bastioned
walls
airs
from
the
deep
wandered
and
touched
the
cordage
as
they
passed
then
hovered
with
expiring
breath
and
stirred
scarce
the
quiescent
pennant
the
bright
sea
lay
silent
in
its
glorious
amplitude
without
far
up
in
the
pale
atmosphere
a
white
cloud
here
and
there
hung
overhead
and
some
red
freckles
streaked
the
horizon
edge
far
as
the
sight
could
reach
beneath
the
rocks
that
reared
their
dark
brows
beetling
the
bay
the
gulls
and
guillemots
with
short
quaint
cry
just
broke
the
sleeping
stillness
of
the
air
or
skimming
almost
touched
the
level
main
with
wings
far
seen
and
more
intensely
white
opposed
to
the
blue
space
whilst
panope
played
in
the
offing
humber
inland
went
sounding
on
by
rocks
and
sands
and
castle
yet
so
sounding
as
it
seemed
a
voice
amidst
the
hushed
and
listening
world
that
spoke
of
peace
whilst
from
the
bastion
point
one
piping
might
almost
be
heard
such
quiet
all
things
hushed
so
peaceable
the
hour
the
very
swallows
ere
they
leave
the
coast
to
pass
a
long
and
weary
way
ocean
solitude
seem
to
renew
once
more
their
summer
feelings
as
a
light
so
sweet
would
last
for
ever
whilst
they
flock
in
the
brief
sunshine
of
the
was
at
this
hour
of
evening
adela
and
godwin
now
restored
by
rest
went
forth
linked
arm
in
arm
upon
the
eastern
beach
beyond
the
headland
shade
if
such
an
hour
seemed
smiling
on
the
heart
how
smiled
it
now
to
him
who
yesternight
a
soldier
stood
amid
the
direst
sight
of
human
strife
and
bloodshed
heard
the
cries
the
trumpet
blast
ring
the
dying
saw
with
all
its
towers
a
city
blazing
to
the
midnight
sky
and
mangled
groups
of
miserable
men
gasping
or
dead
whilst
with
his
iron
heel
he
splashed
the
blood
beneath
how
changed
the
scene
the
sun
last
light
upon
the
battlements
the
sea
the
landscape
the
air
remembered
both
of
the
departed
hours
of
early
life
when
once
they
had
a
home
a
country
where
their
father
wore
a
crown
what
changes
since
that
time
for
them
and
all
they
loved
how
many
found
an
early
grave
cut
off
by
the
red
sword
how
many
mourned
scattered
by
various
fates
through
distant
lands
how
desolate
their
own
poor
country
bound
by
the
oppressor
chain
as
thoughts
like
these
arose
the
bells
of
rural
nevilthorpe
rang
out
a
joyous
peal
rang
merrily
for
tidings
heard
from
york
their
melody
mingled
with
things
forgotten
until
then
and
then
remembered
freshly
adela
that
instant
turned
to
hide
her
tears
and
saw
her
brother
edmund
leading
by
the
hand
a
boy
of
lovely
mien
and
footstep
light
along
the
sands
my
sister
edmund
cried
see
here
a
footpage
i
have
brought
from
york
to
serve
a
lady
fair
the
boy
held
out
his
hand
to
adela
as
he
would
say
look
and
protect
me
lady
adela
advancing
with
a
smile
and
glowing
cheek
cried
welcome
truant
brother
and
then
took
the
child
right
hand
and
said
my
pretty
page
and
have
you
not
a
tale
to
tell
to
me
the
boy
spake
nothing
but
looked
earnestly
and
anxiously
at
edmund
edmund
said
if
he
is
silent
i
must
speak
for
him
was
when
the
minster
flamed
and
sword
in
hand
godwin
and
waltheof
and
stern
hereward
directed
the
red
slaughter
black
with
smoke
i
burst
into
the
citadel
and
saw
not
the
grim
warder
with
his
huge
axe
up
but
her
child
a
frantic
mother
mute
with
horror
in
delirious
agony
clasping
it
to
her
bosom
stern
and
still
the
father
stood
his
hand
upon
his
brow
as
praying
in
that
hour
that
god
might
make
in
mercy
the
last
trial
brief
fear
not
i
am
a
man
nay
fear
not
me
i
cried
and
seizing
this
child
hand
in
safety
placed
amidst
the
smoke
and
sounds
and
sights
of
death
him
and
his
mother
she
with
bursting
heart
knelt
down
to
bless
me
when
i
saw
that
boy
so
beautiful
i
thought
of
adela
and
said
oh
trust
with
his
preserver
him
whom
every
eye
must
view
with
tender
love
oh
trust
me
for
his
safety
lo
i
pledge
my
honour
and
my
life
and
i
have
brought
my
trusted
charge
that
you
my
adela
may
show
him
gentler
courtesy
than
those
whom
war
in
its
stern
trade
has
almost
steeled
his
sister
kissed
the
child
light
hair
and
cheek
and
folded
his
small
hands
in
hers
and
said
you
shall
be
my
true
knight
and
wear
a
plume
wilt
thou
not
boy
and
for
a
lady
love
fight
like
a
valiant
soldier
i
will
die
the
poor
child
said
for
friends
like
those
who
saved
my
father
and
my
mother
and
again
adela
kissed
his
forehead
and
his
eyes
and
said
but
we
are
saxons
as
she
spoke
the
winds
began
to
muster
and
the
sea
swelled
with
a
sound
more
solemn
whilst
the
sun
was
sinking
and
its
last
and
lurid
light
streaked
the
long
line
of
cumbrous
clouds
that
hung
in
wild
red
masses
the
murmuring

flickering
fast
with

night
in

when
york
flamed
to
the
midnight
sky
and
spells
of
death
were
heard
amidst
the
depth
of

woods
for
there
the
wan
and

met
their

the
dark
spirits
that
rejoice

from

and
the
prelates
and
the
knights
long
live
the
conqueror
cried
a
god
on
earth
that
instant
the
high
vaulted
chamber
shook
as
with
a
blast
from
heaven
and
all
was
mute
around
him
and
the
very
fortress
rocked
as
it
would
topple
on
their
heads
he
rose
disturbed
and
frowning
for
tumultuous
thoughts
crowded
like
night
upon
his
heart
then
waved
his
hand
the
barons
abbots
knights
retire
behold
him
now
alone
before
a
lamp
a
crucifix
appears
upon
the
ground
lies
the
same
sword
that
hastings
battle
dyed
deep
to
the
hilt
in
gore
behold
he
kneels
and
prays
thou
only
lord
art
ever
great
have
mercy
on
my
sins
the
crucifix
shook
as
he
spoke
shook
visibly
and
hark
there
is
a
low
moan
as
of
dying
men
at
distance
heard
then
william
first
knew
fear
he
had
heard
tumults
of
the
the
noise
the
glorious
hurrahs
and
the
clang
of
trumpets
round
him
but
no
sound
like
this
ere
smote
with
unknown
terror
on
his
heart
as
if
the
eye
of
god
that
moment
turned
and
saw
it
beating
rising
slow
he
flung
upon
a
couch
his
agitated
limbs
the
lamp
was
near
him
on
the
ground
his
sword
and
helmet
lay
short
troubled
slumbers
stole
and
darkly
rose
the
spirit
of
his
dream
he
saw
a
field
of
blood
it
passed
away
a
glittering
palace
rose
with
mailed
men
thronged
and
the
voice
of
multitudes
was
heard
acclaiming
suddenly
the
sounds
had
ceased
the
glittering
palace
vanished
and
behold
long
winding
cloisters
echoing
to
the
chant
of
stoled
fathers
and
the
ceased
then
a
dark
tomb
appeared
and
lo
a
shape
as
of
a
nearer
it
came
and
nearer
yet
in
silence
through
the
gloom
advancing
still
advancing
the
cold
glare
of
armour
shone
as
it
approached
and
now
it
stands
william
couch
the
spectre
gazed
a
while
then
lifting
its
dark
visor
up
horrible
vision
shewed
a
grisly
wound
deep
in
its
forehead
and
therein
appeared
gouts
as
yet
dropping
from
an
arrow
point
infixed
and
that
red
arrow
deadly
barb
the
shadow
drew
and
pointed
at
the
breast
of
william
and
the
blood
dropped
on
his
breast
and
through
his
steely
arms
one
drop
of
blood
came
cold
as
death
own
hand
upon
his
heart
whilst
a
deep
voice
was
heard

an

the

closed
upon

of

his

clanking
as

knights
in

spurred
their
foaming
steeds
to
the
west
abbey
door
but
who
it
was
that
with
his
visor
closed
passed
up
the
long
and
echoing
fane
alone
and
knelt
on
harold
gravestone
none
could
tell
the
stranger
knights
in
silence
left
the
fane
and
soon
were
lost
in
the
surrounding
shades
of
waltham
forest
he
who
foremost
rode
passed
his
companions
on
his
fleeter
steed
and
muttering
in
a
dark
and
dreamy
mood
spurred
on
alone
till
looking
round
he
heard
only
the
murmur
of
the
woods
above
whilst
soon
all
traces
of
a
road
were
lost
in
the
inextricable
maze
from
morn
till
eve
in
the
wild
woods
he
wandered
lost
night
followed
and
the
gathering
storm
was
heard
among
the
branches
list
there
is
no
sound
of
horn
far
off
or
tramp
of
toiling
steed
or
call
of
some
belated
forester
no
lonely
taper
lights
the
waste
the
woods
wave
high
their
melancholy
boughs
and
bend
beneath
the
rising
tempest
heard
ye
not
low
thunder
to
the
north
the
solemn
roll
redoubles
through
the
darkening
forest
deep
that
sounds
through
all
its
solitude
and
rocks
as
the
long
peal
at
distance
rolls
away
hark
the
loud
thunder
crashes
overhead
and
as
the
red
fire
flings
a
fitful
glare
the
branches
of
old
oaks
and
mossy
trunks
distinct
and
visible
shine
out
and
lo
interminable
woods
a
moment
seen
then
lost
again
in
deeper
lonelier
night
the
torrent
rain
the
vast
leafy
cope
comes
sounding
and
the
drops
fall
heavily
where
the
strange
knight
is
sheltered
by
the
trunk
of
a
huge
oak
whose
dripping
branches
sweep
far
round
oh
happy
if
beneath
the
flash
some
castle
bannered
battlements
were
seen
where
the
lone
minstrel
as
the
storm
of
night
blew
loud
without
beside
the
blazing
hearth
might
dry
his
hoary
locks
and
strike
his
harp
the
fire
relumined
in
his
aged
eyes
to
songs
of
charlemagne
or
happier
yet
if
some
gray
convent
bell
remote
proclaimed
the
hour
of
midnight
service
when
the
chant
was
up
and
the
long
range
of
windows
shone
far
off
on
the
lone
woods
whilst
charity
might
bless
and
welcome
in
a
night
like
this
the
veriest
outcast
angel
of
the
storm
ha
thy
red
bolt
this
instant
shivering
rives
that
blasted
oak
the
horse
starts
back
and
bounds
from
the
knight
grasp
the
way
is
dark
and
wild
as
dark
and
wild
as
if
the
solitude
had
never
heard
the
sound
of
human
steps
pondering
he
stood
when
by
the
lightning
glance
the
knight
now
marked
a
small
and
craggy
path
descending
through
the
woody
labyrinth
he
tracked
his
way
slowly
from
brake
to
brake
till
now
he
gained
a
deep
sequestered
glen
i
fear
not
storms
nor
thunders
nor
the
sword
the
knight
exclaimed
that
eye
alone
i
fear
god
stern
and
steadfast
eye
upon
the
heart
yet
peace
is
in
the
grave
where
harold
sleeps
who
speaks
of
harold
cried
a
woman
voice
heard
through
the
deep
night
of
the
woods
he
spoke
a
stern
voice
answered
of
harold
spoke
who
feared
his
sword
in
the
red
front
of
war
less
than
the
powers
of
darkness
and
he
crossed
his
breast
for
at
that
instant
rose
the
thought
of
the
weird
sisters
of
the
wold
that
mock
night
wanderers
and
syllable
men
names
in
savage
solitude
if
now
he
cried
dark
minister
thy
spells
of
wizard
power
have
raised
the
storm
and
wild
winds
up
appear
he
scarce
had
spoken
when
by
the
red
flash
that
glanced
along
the
glen
half
visible
uprose
a
tall
majestic
female
form
so
visible
her
eyes
intenser
light
shone
wildly
through
the
darkness
and
her
face
on
which
one
pale
flash
more
intently
shone
was
like
a
ghost
by
moonlight
as
she
stood
a
moment
seen
her
lips
appeared
to
move
muttering
whilst
her
long
locks
of
ebon
hair
streamed
her
forehead
by
the
bleak
winds
blown
upon
her
heaving
breast
the
knight
advanced
the
expiring
embers
from
a
cave
within
now
wakened
by
the
shot
a
light
fitful
and
trembling
and
this
human
form
if
it
were
human
at
the
entrance
stood
as
seemed
of
a
rude
cave
you
might
have
thought
she
had
strange
spells
such
a
mysterious
power
was
round
her
such
terrific
solitude
such
night
as
of
the
kingdom
of
the
grave
whilst
hurricanes
seemed
to
obey
her
and
she
no
less
admired
when
front
to
front
by
the
rekindling
ember
darted
gleam
a
mailed
man
of
proud
illustrious
port
she
marked
and
thus
but
with
unfaltering
voice
she
spake
yes
it
was
harold
name
i
heard
whence
and
what
art
thou
i
have
watched
the
night
and
listened
to
the
tempest
as
it
howled
and
whilst
i
listening
lay
methought
i
heard
even
now
the
tramp
as
of
a
rushing
steed
therefore
i
rose
and
looked
into
the
dark
and
now
i
hear
one
speak
of
harold
say
whence
and
what
art
thou
solitary
man
if
lost
and
weary
enter
this
poor
shed
if
wretched
pray
with
me
if
on
dark
deeds
intent
i
am
a
most
poor
woman
cast
into
the
depths
of
mortal
misery
the
desolate
have
nought
to
lose
pass
on
i
had
not
spoken
but
for
harold
name
by
thee
pronounced
it
sounded
in
my
ears
as
of
a
better
world
ah
no
of
days
of
happiness
in
this
whence
who
art
thou
i
am
a
norman
woman
more
to
know
seek
not
and
i
have
been
to
harold
grave
remembering
that
the
mightiest
are
but
dust
and
i
have
prayed
the
peace
of
god
might
rest
upon
his
soul
and
by
our
blessed
lord
the
deed
was
holy
that
lone
woman
said
and
may
the
benediction
of
all
saints
thou
art
rest
on
thy
head
but
say
what
perilous
mischance
hath
hither
led
thy
footsteps
in
an
hour
and
night
like
this
over
his
grave
of
whom
we
spake
i
heard
the
sung
i
knelt
upon
that
grave
and
prayed
for
my
own
sins
i
left
the
fane
and
heard
the
chanted
rite
at
distance
die
returning
through
these
forest
shades
with
thoughts
not
of
this
world
i
pressed
my
panting
steed
the
foremost
of
the
norman
knights
and
passed
the
track
that
leading
to
the
winds
through
the
opening
thickets
on
a
height
i
stood
and
listened
but
no
voice
replied
the
storm
descended
at
the
lightning
flash
my
good
steed
burst
the
reins
and
frantic
fled
i
was
alone
the
small
and
craggy
path
led
to
this
solitary
glen
and
here
as
dark
and
troubled
thoughts
arose
i
mused
upon
the
dead
man
sleep
for
god
i
thought
this
night
spoke
in
the
rocking
of
the
winds
there
is
a
judge
in
heaven
the
woman
said
who
seeth
all
things
and
there
is
a
voice
inaudible
the
tumultuous
world
that
speaks
of
fear
or
comfort
to
the
heart
when
all
is
still
but
shroud
thee
in
this
cave
till
morning
such
a
sojourn
may
not
please
a
courtly
knight
like
echoing
halls
of
joy
i
have
but
some
wild
roots
a
bed
of
fern
and
no
companion
save
this
bloodhound
here
who
at
my
beck
would
tear
thee
to
the
earth
yet
enter
fear
not
and
that
poor
abode
the
proud
knight
entered
with
plume
yet
here
i
dwell
in
peace
the
woman
said
remote
from
towns
nor
start
at
the
dire
sound
of
that
accursed
curfew
thou
art
a
norman
had
the
invader
spurned
all
charities
in
thy
own
native
land
yes
thou
wouldst
know
what
injured
britons
feel
nay
englishwoman
thou
dost
wrong
our
king
the
knight
replied
conspiracy
and
fraud
hourly
surrounding
him
at
last
compelled
stern
rigour
to
awake
what
shall
the
bird
of
thunder
slumber
on
the
citadel
and
blench
his
eye
of
fire
when
looking
down
he
sees
in
ceaseless
enmity
combined
those
who
would
pluck
his
feathers
from
his
breast
and
cast
them
to
the
winds
woman
on
thee
haply
the
tempest
of
the
times
has
beat
too
roughly
but
thy
griefs
he
can
requite
the
indignant
woman
answered
he
requite
can
he
bring
back
the
dead
can
he
restore
joy
to
the
he
requite
can
he
pour
plenty
on
the
vales
his
frown
has
blasted
bid
sweet
evening
hear
again
the
village
pipe
and
the
fair
flowers
revive
his
bloody
footstep
crushed
for
poverty
i
reck
it
not
what
is
to
me
the
night
spent
cheerless
and
in
gloom
and
solitude
i
fix
my
eye
upon
that
crucifix
i
mourn
for
those
that
are
not
for
my
brave
my
buried
countrymen
of
this
no
more
thou
art
a
foe
but
a
brave
would
scorn
to
wrong
a
woman
and
if
death
could
arm
my
hand
this
moment
thou
wert
safe
in
a
poor
cottage
as
in
royal
halls
here
rest
a
while
till
morning
dawns
the
way
no
mortal
could
retrace
not
be
long
and
i
can
cheat
the
time
with
some
old
strain
for
norman
though
thou
art
thy
soul
has
felt
even
as
a
man
when
sacred
sympathy
this
morning
led
thee
to
king
harold
grave
the
woman
sat
beside
the
hearth
and
stirred
the
embers
or
with
fern
or
brushwood
raised
a
fitful
flame
but
cautious
lest
its
light
some
roving
forester
might
mark
at
times
the
small
and
trembling
blaze
shone
on
her
face
still
beautiful
and
showed
the
dark
eye
fire
beneath
her
long
black
locks
when
she
stood
up
a
dignity
though
in
the
garb
of
want
seemed
round
her
chiefly
when
the
glanced
through
the
gloom
and
touched
the
dusky
mail
of
the
strange
knight
then
with
sad
smile
she
sung
oh
when
is
summer
weather
and
the
yellow
bee
with
fairy
sound
the
waters
clear
is
humming
round
and
the
cuckoo
sings
unseen
and
the
leaves
are
waving
green
oh
then
is
sweet
in
some
remote
retreat
to
hear
the
murmuring
dove
with
those
whom
on
earth
alone
we
love
and
to
wind
through
the
greenwood
together
but
when
is
winter
weather
and
crosses
grieve
and
friends
deceive
and
rain
and
sleet
the
lattice
beat
oh
then
is
sweet
to
sit
and
sing
of
the
friends
with
whom
in
the
days
of
spring
we
roamed
through
the
greenwood
together
the
bloodhound
slept
upon
the
hearth
he
raised
his
head
and
through
the
dusk
his
eyes
were
seen
fiery
a
moment
but
again
he
slept
when
she
her
song
renewed
though
thy
words
might
well
deceive
me
that
is
past
subdued
i
bend
yet
for
mercy
do
not
leave
me
to
the
world
without
a
friend
oh
thou
art
gone
and
would
with
thee
remembrance
too
had
fled
she
lives
to
bid
me
weep
and
see
the
wreath
i
cherished
dead
the
knight
through
the
dim
lattice
watched
the
clouds
of
morn
now
slowly
struggling
in
the
east
when
with
a
voice
more
thrilling
and
an
air
wilder
again
a
sad
song
she
intoned
upon
the
field
of
blood
amidst
the
bleeding
brave
his
pale
corse
i
stood
but
he
is
in
his
grave
i
wiped
his
gory
brow
i
smoothed
his
clotted
hair
but
he
is
at
peace
in
the
cold
ground
now
oh
when
shall
we
meet
there
at
once
horns
trumpets
and
the
shouts
of
men
were
heard
above
the
valley
at
the
sound
the
knight
upstarting
from
his
dreamy
trance
high
raised
his
vizor
and
his
bugle
rang
answering
by
god
in
heaven
thou
art
the
king
the
woman
said
again
the
clarions
rung
like
lightning
alain
and
montgomerie
spurred
through
the
wood
and
led
a
harnessed
steed
to
the
lone
cabin
entrance
whilst
the
train
sent
up
a
deafening
shout
long
live
the
king
he
ere
he
vaulted
to
the
turned
with
a
look
benevolent
and
cried
barons
and
lords
to
this
poor
woman
here
haply
i
owe
my
life
let
her
not
need
away
she
cried
king
of
these
realms
away
i
ask
not
wealth
nor
pity
least
from
thee
of
all
men
as
the
day
began
to
dawn
more
fixed
and
dreadful
seemed
her
steadfast
look
the
long
black
hair
upon
her
labouring
breast
streamed
whilst
her
neck
as
in
disdain
she
raised
swelling
her
eyes
a
wild
terrific
light
shot
and
her
voice
with
intonation
deep
uttered
a
curse
that
even
the
bloodhound
crouched
beneath
her
feet
whilst
with
stern
look
she
spoke
yes
i
am
editha
she
whom
he
loved
she
whom
thy
sword
has
left
in
solitude
how
desolate
yes
i
am

and
thou
hast
been
to
harold
grave
oh
think
king
where
thy
own
will
be

rests
in
peace
but
even
a
spot
is
to
thy
bones
denied
i
see
thy
carcase
trodden
under
foot
thy
children
his
with
filial
reverence
still
think
upon
the
spot
where
he
is
laid
though
distant
and
far
severed
but
thy
son
thy
eldest
born
ah
see
he
lifts
the
sword
against
his
father
breast
hark
hark
the
chase
is
up
in
that
wild
forest
thou
hast
made
the
deer
is
flying
the
loud
horn
resounds
hurrah
the
arrow
that
laid
harold

it
flies
it
trembles
in

on
thee

a
moment
with
compassion
gazed
and
now
the
clarions
and
the
horns
and
trumps
rang
louder
the
bright
banners
in
the
winds
waved
beautiful
the
neighing
steeds
aloft
mantled
their
manes
and
up
the
valley
flew
and
soon
have
left
behind
the
glen

upon

adela
exclaimed
malcolm
and
kindly
took
her
hand
she
looked
to
heaven
and
fell
upon
her
knees
then
rose
and
answered
sire
when
my
brave
father
fell
we
three
were
exiles
on
a
distant
shore
and
never
or
in
solitude
or
courts
was
god
forgotten
all
is
in
his
hand
when
those
whom
i
had
loved
from
infancy
here
joined
the
din
of
arms
i
came
with
them
with
them
i
have
partaken
good
and
ill
have
in
the
mother
lap
been
laid
the
same
eye
gazed
on
us
with
tenderness
and
the
same
mother
prayed
prosperity
might
still
be
ours
through
life
alas
our
lot
how
different
yet
let
them
go
with
you
i
argue
not
the
first
time
in
our
lives
if
it
be
so
we
here
shall
separate
whatever
fate
betide
i
will
not
go
till
i
have
knelt
upon
my
father
grave
is
perilous
to
think
atheling
cried
most
perilous
how
the
norman
eye
she
turned
and
with
a
solemn
calmness
said
if
we
should
perish
at
the
hour
of
death
my
father
will
look
down
from
heaven
and
say
come
my
poor
child
oh
come
where
i
am
blessed
my
brothers
seek
your
safety
here
i
stand
resolved
and
never
will
i
leave
these
shores
till
i
have
knelt
upon
my
father
grave
we
never
will
forsake
thee
godwin
cried
let
death
betide
said
edmund
we
will
go
yes
go
with
thee
or
perish
as
he
spoke
the
pilot
gave
the
signal
then
farewell
king
malcolm
cried
friends
lately
met
and
now
to
part
for
ever
and
he
kissed
the
cheek
of
adela
and
took
brave
godwin
hand
and
edmund
and
then
said
almost
in
tears
it
is
not
now
too
late
yet
my
grave
so
might
a
duteous
daughter
weep
god
speed
brave
malcolm
to
his
father
land
they
cried
the
ships
beyond
the
promontory
point
were
anchored
and
the
tide
was
ebbing
fast
then
ailric
sire
not
unforeseen
by
me
was
this
sad
day
oh
king
of
scotland
hear
i
was
a
brother
of
that
holy
house
where
harold
bones
are
buried
from
my
vows
i
was
absolved
and
followed
for
i
loved
his
children
followed
them
through
every
fate
my
few
gray
hairs
will
soon
descend
in
peace
when
i
shall
be
forgotten
but
till
then
my
services
my
last
poor
services
to
them
i
have
devoted
for
the
sake
of
him
their
father
and
my
king
to
whom
all
in
this
world
i
owed
protect
them
lord
and
bless
them
when
the
turf
is
on
my
head
and
in
their
old
age
may
they
sometimes
think
of
ailric
cold
and
shrouded
in
his
grave
when
summer
smiles
sire
listen
whilst
i
pray
one
boon
of
thy
compassion
not
for
me
i
reck
not
whether
vengeance
wake
or
sleep
but
for
the
safety
of
this
innocent
maid
i
speak
south
of
the
humber
in
a
cave
concealed
amidst
the
rocks
and
tangled
brakes
i
have
deposited
some
needful
weeds
for
this
sad
hour
for
well
indeed
i
knew
if
all
should
fail
this
maiden
last
resolve
to
kneel
upon
her
father
grave
or
die
for
this
i
have
provided
but
the
time
is
precious
and
the
sun
is
westering
slow
the
fierce
eye
of
the
lion
may
be
turned
upon
this
spot
adela
now
hear
your
friend
your
father
the
fleet
hour
is
passing
never
to
return
oh
seize
the
instant
thou
king
malcolm
grant
my
prayer
if
we
embark
and
leave
the
shores
this
night
the
voice
of
fame
will
bruit
it
far
and
wide
that
harold
children
fled
with
thee
and
sought
a
refuge
in
thy
kingdom
none
will
know
our
destination
in
thy
boat
conveyed
we
may
be
landed
near
the
rocky
cave
the
boat
again
ply
to
thy
ships
and
they
plough
homeward
the
north
seas
whilst
we
are
left
to
fate
again
the
pilot
voice
was
heard
and
the
an
approaching
file
of
norman
soldiers
with
projected
spears
already
seemed
as
rushing
on
their
prey
then
ailric
took
the
hand
of
adela
she
and
her
brothers
and
young
atheling
and
scotland
king
are
in
one
boat
embarked
meantime
the
sun
sets
red
and
twilight
shades
the
sinking
hills
the
solitary
boat
has
reached
the
adverse
shore
here
then
we
part
king
malcolm
said
and
every
voice
replied
god
speed
brave
malcolm
to
his
father
land
ailric
the
brothers
and
their
sister
left
the
boat
they
stood
upon
the
moonlit
beach
still
listening
to
the
sounds
as
they
grew
faint
of
the
receding
oars
and
watching
still
if
one
white
streak
at
distance
as
they
dipped
were
seen
till
all
was
solitude
around
pensive
they
sought
a
refuge
for
that
night
in
the
bleak
the
morning
dawns
the
brothers
have
put
off
the
plumes
of
war
dropping
one
tear
upon
the
sword
disguised
in
garb
to
suit
their
fortunes
they
appear
like
shipwrecked
seamen
of
armorica
by
a
franciscan
hermit
through
the
land
led
to
st
alban
shrine
to
offer
vows
vows
to
the
god
who
heard
them
in
that
hour
when
all
beside
had
perished
in
the
storm
wrecked
near
his
an
eremite
so
went
the
tale
of
their
disastrous
fate
sustained
them
and
now
guides
them
through
a
land
of
strangers
that
fair
boy
was
wont
to
sing
upon
the
mast
when
the
still
ship
went
slow
along
the
seas
in
sunshine
and
that
garb
conceals
the
lovely
adela
the
cuckoo
note
in
the
deep
woods
was
heard
when
forth
they
fared
at
many
a
convent
gate
they
stood
and
prayed
for
shelter
and
their
pace
hastened
if
high
amid
the
clouds
they
marked
some
solitary
castle
lift
its
brow
gray
in
the
distance
hastened
so
to
reach
ere
it
grew
dark
its
hospitable
towers
there
the
lithe
minstrel
sung
his
roundelay
listen
lords
and
ladies
bright
i
can
sing
of
many
a
knight
who
fought
in
paynim
lands
afar
of
bevis
or
of
iscapar
i
have
tales
of
wandering
maids
and
fairy
elves
in
haunted
glades
of
that
silent
ride
by
the
moonlit
forest
side
i
have
songs
fair
maidens
hear
to
warn
the
lovelorn
lady
ear
the
choice
of
all
my
treasures
take
and
grant
us
food
for
pity
sake
when
tired
at
noon
by
the
white
waterfall
in
some
romantic
and
secluded
glen
they
sat
and
heard
the
blackbird
overhead
singing
unseen
a
song
such
as
they
heard
in
infancy
so
every
vernal
morn
brought
with
it
scents
of
flowers
or
songs
of
birds
mingled
with
many
shapings
of
old
things
and
days
gone
by
then
up
again
to
scale
the
airy
mountain
and
behold
the
plain
stretching
below
and
fading
far
away
how
beautiful
yet
still
to
feel
a
tear
starting
even
when
it
shone
most
beautiful
to
think
here
in
the
country
of
our
birth
no
rest
is
ours
on
to
our
father
grave
so
southward
through
the
country
they
had
passed
now
many
days
and
casual
shelter
found
in
villages
or
hermit
lonely
cave
or
castle
high
embattled
on
the
point
of
some
steep
mountain
or
in
convent
walls
for
most
with
pity
heard
his
song
and
marked
the
countenance
of
the
wayfaring
boy
or
when
the
pale
monk
with
his
folded
hands
upon
his
breast
prayed
for
the
love
of
god
pity
the
poor
give
alms
and
bade
them
speed
and
now
in
distant
light
the
pinnacles
of
a
gray
fane
appeared
whilst
on
the
woods
still
evening
shed
its
parting
light
oh
say
say
villager
what
towers
are
those
that
rise
eastward
beyond
the
alders
know
ye
not
he
answered
waltham
abbey
harold
there
is
buried
he
who
in
the
fight
was
slain
at
hastings
to
the
cheek
of
adela
a
deadly
paleness
came
on
let
us
on
faintly
she
cried
and
held
her
brother
arm
and
hid
her
face
a
moment
with
her
hand
and
now
the
massy
portal
sculptured
arch
before
them
rose
say
porter
ailric
cried
poor
mariners
wrecked
on
the
northern
shores
ask
charity
does
aged
osgood
live
tell
him
a
poor
franciscan
wandering
far
and
wearied
for
the
love
of
god
would
ask
his
charity
osgood
came
slowly
forth
the
light
that
touched
the
western
turret
fell
on
his
pale
face
the
said
i
am
your
brother
ailric
look
on
me
and
these
are
harold
children
whilst
he
spoke
godwin
advancing
with
emotion
cried
we
are
his
children
i
am
godwin
this
is
edmund
and
lo
poor
and
in
disguise
our
sister
we
would
kneel
upon
his
grave
our
father
come
yet
nearer
osgood
said
yet
nearer
and
that
instant
adela
looked
up
and
wiping
from
her
eyes
a
tear
have
you
forgotten
adela
o
god
the
old
man
trembling
cried
ye
are
indeed
our
benefactor
children
adela
edmund
brave
godwin
welcome
to
these
walls
welcome
my
old
companion
and
he
fell
upon
the
neck
of
ailric
and
both
wept
then
osgood
children
of
that
honoured
lord
who
gave
us
all
go
near
and
bless
his
grave
one
parting
sunbeam
yet
upon
the
floor
rested
it
passed
away
and
darker
gloom
was
gathering
in
the
aisles
each
footstep
sound
was
more
distinctly
heard
for
all
beside
was
silent
slow
along
the
glimmering
fane
they
passed
like
shadows
risen
from
the
tombs
the
was
closed
lest
aught
intrude
upon
the
sanctity
of
this
sad
hour
the
inner
choir
they
enter
part
in
shade
and
part
in
light
for
now
the
rising
moon
began
to
glance
upon
the
shrines
and
tombs
and
pillars
trembling
through
the
windows
high
one
beam
a
moment
on
that
cold
gray
stone
is
flung
the
word
infelix
is
scarce
seen
behold
his
gravestone
osgood
said
each
eye
was
turned
a
while
intent
they
gazed
then
knelt
before
the
altar
on
the
marble
stone
no
sound
was
heard
through
all
the
dim
expanse
of
the
vast
building
none
but
of
the
air
that
came
in
dying
echoes
up
the
aisle
like
whispers
heard
at
the
confessional
thus
harold
children
hand
in
hand
knelt
down
upon
their
father
grave
knelt
down
and
prayed
have
mercy
on
his
soul
have
mercy
lord
they
knelt
a
lengthened
space
and
bowed
their
heads
some
natural
tears
they
shed
and
crossed
their
breasts
then
rising
slowly
up
looked
round
and
saw
a
monk
approaching
near
unmarked
before
and
in
the
further
distance
the
tall
form
as
of
a
female
he
who
wore
the
hood
and
habit
of
a
monk
approached
and
spoke
brothers
beloved
sister
know
ye
not
these
features
and
he
raised
his
hood
behold
me
me
your
brother
marcus
whom
these
weeds
since
last
we
met
have
hidden
from
the
world
let
me
kneel
with
you
here
when
adela
beheld
him
she
exclaimed
oh
do
we
meet
here
my
lost
brother
a
father
grave
you
live
restored
a
moment
in
this
world
to
us
as
from
the
grave
and
godwin
took
his
hand
and
said
my
brother
tell
us
all
how
have
you
lived
unknown
oh
tell
us
all
when
in
that
grave
our
father
he
replied
was
laid
ye
fled
and
i
in
this
sad
land
remained
to
cope
with
fortune
to
these
walls
i
came
when
ailric
from
his
vows
absolved
with
you
was
wandering
none
my
lineage
knew
or
name
but
i
some
time
had
won
regard
from
the
superior
osgood
knew
me
not
for
with
earl
edwin
i
had
lived
from
youth
to
our
superior
thus
i
knelt
and
prayed
sir
i
beseech
you
for
the
love
of
god
and
of
our
lady
mary
and
st
john
you
would
receive
me
here
to
live
and
die
among
you
what
most
moved
my
heart
to
take
the
vows
was
this
that
here
from
day
to
day
from
year
to
year
within
the
walls
he
raised
i
might
behold
my
father
grave
this
eve
i
sat
in
the
confessional
unseen
when
you
approached
i
scarce
restrained
the
tear
from
many
recollections
when
i
heard
a
tale
of
sorrow
and
of
sin
come
near
woman
of
woe
and
a
wan
woman
stood
before
them
tall
and
stately
her
dark
eyes
shone
as
the
uncertain
lamp
cast
a
brief
glare
and
showed
her
neck
and
raven
hair
and
lips
moving
she
spoke
not
but
advanced
and
knelt
she
too
on
harold
grave
then
prayed
aloud
o
god
be
merciful
to
him
and
me
who
art
thou
godwin
cried
ah
know
ye
not
the
wretched
editha
no
children
love
could
equal
mine
i
trod
among
the
dead
did
i
not
fathers
trod
among
the
dead
from
corse
to
corse
or
saw
men
dying
eyes
fixed
upon
mine
and
heard
such
groans
as
yet
rive
with
remembrance
my
torn
heart
i
found
him
who
rests
here
where
then
he
lay
in
blood
when
he
was
buried
i
beheld
the
rites
at
distance
and
with
broken
heart
retired
to
the
wild
woods
there
i
have
lived
unseen
from
that
sad
hour
late
when
the
tempest
rocked
at
midnight
a
proud
soldier
shelter
sought
in
my
lone
cell
was
when
the
storm
was
heard
through
the
deep
forest
and
he
too
had
knelt
at
harold
grave
who
was
it
he
the
king
say
fathers
was
it
not
the
hand
of
god
that
led
his
footsteps
there
but
has
he
learned
humility
oh
ask
this
bleeding
land
last
night
a
phantom
came
to
me
in
dreams
and
a
voice
said
come
visit
my
cold
grave
i
came
by
some
mysterious
impulse
led
i
heard
the
even
song
and
when
the
sound
had
ceased
and
all
departed
save
one
monk
who
stood
and
gazed
upon
this
grave
alone
i
prayed
that
he
would
hear
me
at
this
hour
confess
my
secret
sins
for
my
full
heart
was
labouring
it
was
harold
son
who
sat
in
the
confessional
to
me
unknown
but
all
is
now
revealed
and
lo
i
stand
before
you
as
she
spoke
a
thrilling
awe
came
to
each
heart
loftier
she
seemed
to
stand
in
the
dim
moonlight
sorrowful
yet
stern
her
aspect
and
her
breast
was
seen
to
beat
her
eyes
were
fixed
and
shone
with
fearful
light
she
raised
her
right
hand
and
her
dark
hair
fell
upon
her
neck
whilst
all
scarce
breathing
heard
my
spirit
labours
she
exclaimed
this
night
the
tomb
the
altar
ha
the
vision
strains
my
senses
to
oppression
marked
ye
not
the
trodden
throne
restored
the
saxon
line
of
england
monarchs
bursting
through
the
gloom
lady
i
look
on
thee
in
distant
years
even
from
the
northern
throne
which
thou
shalt
share
a
shall
arise
whose
arm
in
concert
with
this
country
now
bowed
low
shall
tear
the
eagle
from
a
conqueror
grasp
far
greater
than
this
norman
spare
o
god
my
burning
brain
then
with
a
shriek
she
fell
insensible
upon
the
saxon
grave
they
bore
her
from
the
fane
and
godwin
said
peace
peace
be
with
her
now
and
evermore
he
taking
marcus
by
the
hand
yet
here
thou
shalt
behold
behold
from
day
to
day
this
honoured
grave
but
where
in
the
great
world
shall
be
thy
place
of
rest
poor
adela
o
god
be
ever
with
her
marcus
cried
with
her
and
you
my
brothers
here
we
part
never
to
meet
again
your
fate
i
shall
remember
with
a
brother
love
and
pray
for
you
but
all
my
spirit
rests
in
other
worlds
in
worlds
oh
not
like
this
ye
may
return
to
this
sad
scene
when
i
am
dust
and
ashes
ye
may
yet
return
and
visit
this
sad
spot
perhaps
when
age
or
grief
has
brought
such
change
of
heart
as
now
i
feel
then
shall
you
look
upon
my
grave
and
shed
one
tear
for
him
whose
latest
prayer
will
be
oh
bless
you
bless
my
sister
lord
then
adela
with
lifted
look
composed
father
it
is
performed
the
duty
vowed
when
we
returned
to
this
devoted
land
the
last
sad
duty
of
a
daughter
love
and
now
i
go
in
peace
go
to
a
world
of
sorrow
conscious
that
a
father
voice
speaks
to
my
soul
and
that
thine
eye
o
god
the
fortunes
of
our
future
days
is
us
thou
direct
our
onward
road
the
last
saxon
grave
old
osgood
raised
his
hands
and
prayed
father
of
heaven
and
earth
all
is
beneath
thine
eye
is
ours
to
bend
in
silence
children
of
misfortune
loved
revered
children
of
him
who
raised
these
roofs
no
home
is
found
for
you
in
this
sad
land
and
none
perhaps
may
know
the
spot
or
shed
a
tear
upon
the
earth
where
ye
are
laid
so
saying
on
their
heads
he
placed
his
hands
and
blessed
them
all
but
after
pause
rejoined
is
dangerous
lingering
here
the
lynx
would
lap
your
blood
westward
beyond
the
lea
there
is
a
cell
where
ye
may
rest
the
portal
opened
on
the
battlements
the
moonlight
shone
silent
and
beautiful
before
them
lay
their
path
through
the
wide
world
the
nightingales
were
singing
as
they
passed
and
looking
back
upon
the
glimmering
towers
they
led
by
ailric
and
with
thoughts
on
heaven
through
the
lone
forest
held
their
pensive
way
conclusion
william
on
his
imperial
throne
at
york
is
seated
clad
in
steel
all
but
his
face
from
casque
to
spur
his
brow
yet
wears
a
frown
and
his
eyes
show
the
unextinguished
fire
of
steadfast
vengeance
as
his
inmost
heart
yet
labours
like
the
ocean
after
storm
his
sword
unsheathed
appears
which
none
besides
can
wield
his
sable
beard
full
and
diffused
below
the
casque
is
spread
the
lion
ramps
upon
his
mailed
breast
engrailed
with
gold
behind
him
stand
his
barons
in

file
ranged
and
each

hid
beneath
the
helms
spears
with
escutcheoned
banners
on
their
points
above
their

alike
are
cased
in

knight
who
next
behind

intent
to

a
loftier

he
who
kneels
before
the
seat

with

chequered
his

i
give

and
kissed
his
iron

then
slowly
rose
whilst
all
the

shouted

the

if

of
lords
hath
showed
unto
thee
and
for
the
reliefe
of
their
soules
who
in
this
quarrell
have
ended
their
dayes
that
it
may
be
lawfull
for
us
by
thy
good
leave
safely
to
take
and
carry
away
with
us
the
dead
body
of
the
king
the
founder
and
builder
of
our
church
and
monasterie
as
also
the
bodies
of
such
others
as
whom
for
the
reverence
of
him
and
for
his
sake
desired
also
to
be
buried
with
us
that
the
state
of
our
church
by
their
helpe
strengthened
may
be
the
stronger
and
endure
the
firmer
with
whose
so
humble
a
request
and
abundant
teares
the
victorious
and
worthy
duke
moved
answered
king
said
he
unmindfull
of
his
faith
although
he
have
for
the
present
endured
the
worthy
punishment
of
his
fault
yet
hath
he
not
therefore
deserved
to
want
the
honour
of
a
sepulchre
or
to
lie
unburied
were
it
but
that
he
died
a
king
howsoever
he
came
by
the
kingdom
my
purpose
is
for
the
reverence
of
him
and
for
the
health
of
them
who
having
left
their
wives
and
possessions
have
here
in
my
quarrel
lost
their
lives
to
build
here
a
church
and
a
monastery
with
an
hundred
monkes
in
it
to
pray
for
them
for
ever
and
in
the
same
church
to
bury
your
king
above
the
rest
with
all
honour
unto
so
great
a
prince
and
for
his
sake
to
endow
the
same
with
great
revenewes
with
which
his
courteous
speech
and
promises
the
two
religious
fathers
comforted
and
encouraged
again
replied
so
noble
duke
but
grant
this
thy
servants
most
humble
request
that
we
may
for
god
by
thy
leave
receive
the
dead
body
of
our
founder
and
to
bury
it
in
the
place
which
himself
in
his
lifetime
appointed
that
wee
cheered
with
the
presence
of
his
body
may
thereof
take
comfort
and
that
his
tombe
may
be
unto
our
successors
a
perpetual
monument
of
his
remembrance
the
duke
as
he
was
of
disposition
gracious
and
inclined
to
mercy
forthwith
granted
their
desires
whereupon
they
drew
out
stores
of
gold
to
present
him
in
way
of
gratulation
which
he
not
only
utterly
refused
but
also
offered
them
plenty
to
supply
whatsoever
should
be
needfull
for
the
pompe
of
his
funerall
as
also
for
their
costs
in
travaile
to
and
fro
giving
strait
commandments
that
none
of
his
souldiers
should
persume
to
molest
them
in
this
businesse
or
in
their
returne
then
went
they
in
haste
to
the
quarry
of
the
dead
but
by
no
meanes
could
find
the
body
of
the
king
for
the
countenances
of
all
men
greatly
alter
by
death
but
being
maimed
and
imbrued
with
bloud
they
are
not
known
to
be
the
men
they
were
as
for
his
other
regall
ornaments
which
might
have
shewed
him
for
their
king
his
dead
corps
was
despoyled
of
them
either
through
the
greedy
desire
of
prey
as
the
manner
of
the
field
is
or
to
be
the
first
bringer
of
such
happy
news
in
hope
of
a
princely
reward
upon
which
purpose
many
times
the
body
is
both
mangled
and
dismembred
and
so
was
this
king
after
his
death
by
a
base
souldier
gasht
and
hackt
into
the
legge
whom
duke
william
rewarded

this

was

published
under
the
name
of
one
of
the
living
poets
of
great
britain
i
have
thought
it
best
to
revise
and
publish
it
in
my
own
name
and
as
it
is
the
last
written
by
me

the

i
may
ever
live

have
added
from

selected
verses

these
were

have

hear

have
struck

i
have
lived
to
see
among

many
illustrious
masters

names
i

excited
by

youthful

which
i
have
now
with
melancholy

revised

it
is
a
consolation
that
from

where
the

wont
to
rove

scowled
in

old
man
tranquilly
listening
to
the
and
resting
on

beside

on

went

there
a

dark
eye
still
flashed
unconquered
pride
and
sullen
hate
to
man
and
looking
on
his
iron
chain
he
muttered
to
himself
a
deeper
curse
the
old
man
had
his
dwelling
in
a
cave
upon
the
desert
mountain
side
now
bent
with
the
full
weight
of
eighty
years
and
upwards
and
that
caverned
five
years
had
been
his
dwelling
there
he
sat
oft
holding
converse
not
with
forms
of
earth
but
as
was
said
with
spirits
of
the
blessed
beyond
this
cloudy
sphere
or
with
the
dead
of
other
days
a
girdle
bound
his
loins
figs
and
icarian
honey
were
his
food
an
cup
by
a
clear
fount
was
seen
his
long
locks
and
his
white
descending
beard
shook
when
he
tottered
down
into
the
sun
supported
by
a
slender
cross
of
pine
his
staff
and
when
the
evening
star
arose
asia
a
brief
time
he
stood
and
gazed
then
sought
his
melancholy
cave
and
prayed
and
who
in
this
sad
place
was
this
old
man
who
in
this
island
where
the
robber
scowled
was
this
old
man
exiled
and
destitute
old
but
so
reverenced
the
murderer
passed
his
rocky
dwelling
and
bade
peace
to
it
was
he
who
leaned
upon
our
saviour
breast
at
the
last
supper
he
to
whom
the
lord
looking
upon
his
countenance
of
youth
his
calm
clear
forehead
and
his
clustering
hair
said
what
if
he
shall
tarry
till
i
come
long
years
and
many
sorrows
marked
these
years
had
passed
since
this
was
said
and
now
that
face
was
furrowed
with
age
and
weariness
and
exile
in
the
last
lone
days
of
life
were
now
his
lot
for
they
whom
he
had
loved
they
the
disciples
of
him
crucified
professing
one
warm
faith
one
glorious
hope
were
all
in
the
same
faith
and
the
same
hope
laid
down
in
peace
after
their
pilgrimage
where
the
world
ceased
from
troubling
he
alone
lingered
when
all
were
dead
with
fervent
prayer
soon
in
the
bosom
of
his
lord
to
rest
and
now
he
comes
forth
from
his
rocky
cave
to
gaze
a
while
upon
the
silent
sea
in
the
calm
eventide
of
the
lord
day
to
think
on
him
he
loved
and
of
that
voice
once
heard
on
earth
so
pondering
on
his
staff
the
old
man
watched
another
sun
go
down
beyond
the
cape
of
tenos
the
still
sea
slept
in
the
light
of
eve
beneath
his
feet
and
often
as
in
very
gentleness
it
seemed
to
touch
his
sandals
and
retire
and
now
the
last
limb
of
the
sinking
orb
is
hid
yet
far
away
the
cloudy
track
reddens
with
its
departing
glory
hark
a
voice
and
lo
seven
golden
candlesticks
the
angels
of
the
churches
upon
earth
seven
golden
candlesticks
and
he
the
lord
among
them
like
unto
that
son
of
god
who
radiant
on
the
mount
of
vision
stood
now
recognised
the
same
in
the
same
shape
his
hair
was
white
as
snow
his
eyes
were
flame
his
voice
the
sound
of
waters
in
his
hand
his
raised
right
hand
seven
stars
his
countenance
as
the
bright
sun
that
shineth
in
his
strength
and
yet
serene
as
the
descending
day
it
was
the
lord
the
old
man
at
his
feet
fell
down
as
dead
the
apparition
stood
glorious
above
his
head
and
spoke
fear
not
i
am
the
first
and
last
the
last
and
first
lo
i
am
he
that
liveth
and
was
dead
and
now
behold
i
live
for
evermore
for
evermore
and
have
the
keys
of
hell
and
death
the
glory
passed
and
all
around
is
still
as
death
the
old
man
sinks
to
earth
astonied
faint
and
pale
when
the
slow
sense
struggled
to
recollection
he
looked
around
yet
trembling
but
no
voice
was
heard
no
form
stood
bending
in
its
glory
him
then
seemed
the
hills
of
that
forsaken
isle
more
dreary
and
the
promontories
bare
lifted
their
brows
more
dark
and
desolate
back
to
his
lonely
cave
the
old
man
passed
and
wrapped
in
thoughts
of
heaven
lifted
in
prayer
his
clasped
emaciate
hands
then
on
his
bed
of
rushes
in
the
cave
lay
down
to
rest
till
dawn
what
was
his
dream
he
saw
again
as
when
the
rocks
were
rent
and
darkness
at
midday
was
the
land
his
saviour
calmly
bowing
his
meek
head
upon
the
cross
he
heard
that
thrilling
voice
even
from
the
cross
woman
behold
thy
son
son
look
upon
thy
mother
then
he
saw
the
forms
of
those
whom
he
had
loved
on
earth
and
heard
their
voices
still
and
stood
entranced
with
peter
and
with
james
upon
the
mount
of
glorious
vision
now
he
saw
in
dreams
again
the
glistening
apparition
rise
and
stand
above
him
he
has
tarried
long
and
lonely
in
the
world
the
vision
comes
to
animate
his
hopes
to
say
live
live
with
me
for
evermore
and
lo
the
keys
this
opens
the
bright
mansions
of
the
blessed
this
closes
the
eternal
gates
of
hell
upon
the
gnashing
of
the
teeth
and
groans
unutterable
so
the
saviour
spoke
as
seemed
in
his
sleep
ah
the
stern
shade
of
murdered
c√¶sar
rises
art
thou
dead
king
of
the
world
for
this
didst
thou
proclaim
thyself
a
god
a
living
god
on
earth
let
the
pit
hide
thee
but
thou
art
a
god
then
bid
the
fury
of
these
flames
assuage
ere
they
reach
thee
who
shrieked
at
the
sound
the
ancient
and
the
solitary
man
started
from
sleep
the
cold
gray
dawn
appeared
when
standing
opposite
with
steadfast
look
and
in
the
glimmer
of
the
inmost
cave
he
saw
a
stranger
whence
and
who
art
thou
with
trembling
voice
he
asked
whence
who
art
thou
perhaps
the
spirit
of
this
dismal
isle
or
cast
upon
these
melancholy
rocks
a
poor
and
thing
like
me
the
stranger
gazed
unmoved
and
answered
not
his
looks
were
those
of
pity
of
respect
as
mingling
thoughtful
wisdom
with
the
grace
of
beauty
in
his
hand
he
held
a
book
he
opened
it
and
never
light
appeared
so
fair
as
that
on
his
majestic
brow
for
now
the
sun
had
risen
and
its
beams
shot
far
into
the
cave
john
gazed
with
awe
on
that
majestic
man
he
knew
not
why
and
well
might
he
have
gazed
with
reverence
for
here
in
this
rude
spot
he
only
saw
men
the
most
dark
and
savage
of
their
kind
murderers
and
ruthless
criminals
in
chains
he
spoke
to
them
of
truth
and
righteousness
he
spoke
of
an
offended
god
some
looked
to
the
bright
sun
defying
others
turned
muttering
he
spoke
of
pity
and
they
heard
even
as
the
relentless
hurricane
hears
the
last
prayer
of
the
faint
mariner
whom
wintry
waves
had
dashed
upon
the
rocks
yet
ever
with
the
gentlest
offices
with
tears
and
prayers
the
holy
exile
strove
to
wake
their
better
feelings
for
he
laid
his
hands
upon
the
sick
and
they
looked
up
with
hope
and
blessed
him
and
restored
to
strength
forgot
the
vows
they
made
him
too
who
died
hardened
and
as
to
human
eyes
in
sin
he
laid
in
the
cold
grave
and
said
a
prayer
for
mercy
to
the
god
of
all
the
judge
to
whom
all
hearts
be
open
and
from
whom
no
secret
thought
is
hid
and
mortal
himself
presumed
not
to
condemn
so
passed
this
ancient
holy
man
his
days
peaceful
amid
the
banished
criminals
banished
and
poor
himself
but
living
thus
among
the
sternest
of
their
kind
he
prayed
for
their
salvation
so
he
passed
his
days
peaceful
but
sad
and
now
with
anxious
gaze
he
turned
his
look
to
the
mysterious
man
who
steadfastly
beholding
him
thus
spoke
the
voice
of
prophecy
has
been
fulfilled
where
is
the
temple
where
jerusalem
ah
wretched
city
famine
war
and
woe
have
done
their
destined
work
the
living
drops
dead
on
the
carcase
he
is
burying
that
famished
babe
is
black
oh
turn
away
all
all
is
silent
now
and
thou
hast
seen
this
prophecy
fulfilled
for
not
one
stone
of
beautiful
and
sacred
solima
is
left
upon
another
he
who
died
when
he
beheld
the
city
it
wept
and
said
o
daughters
of
jerusalem
weep
not
for
me
but
for
your
little
ones
the
tender
words
dost
thou
remember
them
jerusalem
jerusalem
how
oft
would
i
have
gathered
up
those
little
ones
even
as
a
hen
beneath
a
mother
wing
but
ye
would
not
and
now
behold
your
house
is
left
unto
you
desolate
alas
how
desolate
but
even
in
those
last
days
warning
was
given
if
yet
they
would
repent
a
bloody
sword
like
a
red
comet
hung
above
the
temple
and
a
strange
sad
light
sat
on
the
altar
while
the
inner
gate
untouched
at
midnight
burst
its
brazen
bars
and
stood
wide
open
armed
men
did
fight
amid
the
clouds
and
in
the
dead
of
night
the
pale
priest
heard
a
voice
depart
depart
so
the
fair
city
of
jerusalem
perished
but
lo
christ
holy
church
shall
rise
rise
from
its
ashes
yea
is
risen
now
its
glorious
gates
shall
never
be
cast
down
till
he
the
king
of
glory
shall
appear
he
founded
it
upon
a
rock
a
rock
which
time
the
rushing
earthquake
or
the
storm
whilst
earth
endures
shall
never
shake
old
man
beloved
of
the
lord
wouldst
thou
know
more
what
things
shall
be
hereafter
rise
and
mark
the
old
man
lifting
up
his
eyelids
slow
saw
a
door
opened
in
the
heaven
and
heard
a
voice
as
of
a
trumpet
come
and
see
straight
he
was
in
the
spirit
and
the
voice
inquired
what
vision
comes
the
seer
replied
there
is
a
throne
in
heaven
and
on
the
throne
one
sitteth
and
he
seems
to
look
upon
red
as
a
a
deep
deep
red
is
round
about
yet
as
a
jasper
bright
his
face
the
sun
is
of
an
ashy
pale
so
red
and
bright
that
form
voice
thou
seest
the
throne
of
the
eternal
justice
look
again
john
there
is
a
rainbow
round
about
the
throne
tempering
the
fiery
red
voice
it
is
the
bow
of
mercy
and
of
pardon
and
of
peace
of
mercy
as
when
stealing
from
the
clouds
it
came
forth
beautiful
and
silently
above
the
waste
of
waters
and
the
flood
receding
token
of
the
covenant
of
grace
restored
while
the
great
orb
of
day
shone
westering
and
some
few
small
drops
of
rain
fell
transient
in
the
sunshine
where
far
off
the
wings
of
the
ascending
dove
were
seen
and
by
the
altar
in
the
that
light
upon
the
altar
and
his
brow
the
world
survivor
stood
what
seest
thou
more
john
about
the
throne

four
and
twenty
seats
and

and
twenty
elders
clothed
in
white
each
having

his
head
a
crown

those
seats

a
voice

strong
angel

loud
voice

dark
book

the
quail
goes
clamouring
by
the
old
man
raises
his
eyelids
and
the
vision
floats
away
part
second
morning
in
the
√¶gean
contemplative
view
seven
churches
of
asia
superstitions
crete
egypt
spread
of
gospel
light
through
the
pagan
world
how
beautiful
is
morning
on
the
hills
of
asia
stretching
far
and
faint
descried
while
nearer
all
the
sunny
sporades
that
break
the
blue
√¶gean
shine
in
light
on
this
autumnal
dawn
how
musical
the
fresh
airs
and
the
ocean
solemn
sound
come
to
the
mountain
grot
let
us
go
forth
said
then
the
unknown
and
mysterious
man
john
first
on
that
mossy
stone
beneath
the
arch
kneel
we
and
offer
up
our
orisons
to
him
who
bade
the
sun
go
forth
o
god
thou
didst
create
this
living
world
thy
voice
when
darkness
sat
upon
the
lonely
deep
spoke
be
there
light
and
there
was
light
thy
hand
spread
out
the
heavens
and
fashioned
from
the
dust
man
the
high
habitant
of
earth
now
fallen
and
to
return
to
dust
again
but
thanks
be
unto
thee
o
christ
who
when
the
trump
shall
sound
and
all
this
mortal
pomp
is
passed
shalt
call
the
dead
up
incorruptible
and
glory
be
to
thee
o
spirit
pure
who
hast
infused
into
our
hearts
of
flesh
the
love
of
god
through
faith
in
jesus
christ
oh
in
the
hour
of
death
and
in
the
day
of
judgment
lord
to
us
be
merciful
so
prayed
they
suppliant
when
morning
shone
upon
the
seas
so
they
together
prayed
giving
god
thanks
that
one
more
day
of
light
was
granted
to
the
feeble
and
the
old
ere
long
to
rest
in
peace
upon
their
heads
as
slow
they
rose
a
halo
seemed
to
rest
touching
the
forehead
of
the
aged
man
the
features
of
the
younger
as
he
stood
were
mild
but
awful
thoughtful
yet
not
sad
whilst
from
the
caverned
rock
into
the
sun
the
lonely
and
the
last
apostle
came
as
both
together
stood
and
gazed
a
while
upon
the
deep
blue
sea
the
younger
said
listen
old
man
i
was
at
antioch
when
mild
evodias
filled
st
peter
chair
and
fair
that
place
as
well
beseems
the
spot
where
first
the
christian
name
was
heard
the
vale
of
tempe
sung
through
greece
is
not
so
fair
as
that
green
valley
where
orontes
winds
beneath
the
grove
of
daphne
to
the
sea
scarce
eden
fairer
where
the
man
stood
up
majestic
in
the
world
new
day
i
heard
evodias
and
from
youth
i
loved
to
wander
the
scenes
of
old
renown
hallowed
by
prophets
and
by
holy
men
who
long
from
earth
had
passed
how
beautiful
upon
those
hills
and
mountains
were
the
feet
of
them
who
brought
glad
tidings
of
the
light
now
risen
on
the
darkened
world
i
sat
upon
a
stone
of
fallen
jerusalem
sat
down
and
wept
when
i
remembered
thee
o
sion
and
thy
temple
and
thy
sons
scattered
in
the
wide
world
scattered
or
dead
like
him
the
mighty
prophet
who
of
yore
watched
the
dark
gathering
of
the
clouds
and
rain
i
stood
upon
mount
carmel
and
beheld
the
great
sea
westward
hark
euroclydon
is
up
the
tempest
rushes
from
the
east
fire
and
the
whirlwind
follow
but
o
god
thou
art
not
in
the
whirlwind
nor
the
fire
and
after
came
a
still
small
voice
which
said
go
visit
john
sad
and
in
solitude
we
sailed
from
joppa
in
a
tyrian
ship
to
rhodes
a
skiff
was
waiting
near
the
shore
on
which
the
shadowy
moonlight
seemed
to
rest
then
a
pale
mariner
who
never
spoke
conveyed
me
hither
swift
as
silently
swift
though
the
passing
keel
no
murmur
made
as
the
dim
sail
no
shadow
cast
i
looked
when
i
had
reached
the
shore
and
it
was
gone
i
saw
thy
i
stood
and
gazed
a
while
on
thy
gray
hairs
as
thou
didst
sleep
and
the
same
voice
which
came
after
the
wind
said
audibly
reveal
to
him
the
things
that
shall
hereafter
be
as
i
unfold
i
watched
when
the
great
vision
came
to
thee
hearing
the
voice
and
answer
it
was
sent
to
animate
thy
hope
art
thou
refreshed
as
now
these
airs
of
morn
blow
soothingly
and
breathe
a
sad
repose
john
placed
his
hand
pale
and
emaciate
on
his
breast
and
said
thy
words
might
raise
from
earth
the
heaviest
heart
then
both
in
silence
gazed
on
the
blue
sea
and
heard
it
murmuring
john
his
full
look
towards
his
face
who
spoke
now
turned
intent
to
mark
his
features
dignity
serene
was
on
that
face
and
as
the
freshening
airs
stirred
the
dark
locks
that
clustered
round
his
brow
a
faint
rose
mantled
on
his
cheek
his
cloak
gathered
upon
his
breast
descending
touched
his
sandals
whilst
with
more
majestic
mien
pointing
to
asia
hills
he
spoke
again
old
man
lift
up
thine
eyes
turn
to
the
east
how
fair
with
tower
and
turret
by
the
stream
of
clear
cayister
shines
that
ephesus
the
angel
of
whose
golden
candlestick
here
droops
in
banishment
hail
smyrna
hail
beneath
thy
towers
and
piers
and
bastions
through
intermingled
cypresses
ships
from
all
nations
with
their
ensigns
float
silent
but
lo
a
purer
light
from
heaven
is
on
thy
walls
while
from
the
citadel
streams
the
triumphant
banner
of
the
cross
and
beautiful
thy
sisters
of
the
faith
first
in
the
east
when
the
wide
world
was
dark
laodicea
philadelphia
and
pergamos
and
thyatira
shine
while
sardis
at
the
foot
of
tmolus
high
seems
from
the
wildering
plains
below
to
gleam
like
a
still
star
that
guides
the
sailor
way
adria
but
alas
here
antichrist
shall
rise
with
power
permitted
from
on
high
mourn
ephesus
thy
glory
and
thy
light
extinguished
sardis
thyatira
mourn
yet
the
blessed
kingdom
of
the
lamb
again
shall
be
restored
and
all
the
earth
bow
down
to
the
unarmed
conqueror
of
the
world
turn
to
the
south
there
are
the
pines
of
crete
and
hark
the
frantic
coribantes
shout
to
cybele
the
mother
of
the
gods
drawn
by
gaunt
lions
in
her
car
they
move
in
stern
subjection
and
with
slow
and
shaggy
necks
hung
down
though
their
red
eyes
flash
fire
beneath
silent
and
slow
they
pace
cymbals
shouts
and
songs
and
clashing
swords
pipes
and
the
dissonance
of
brazen
drums
she
bears
aloft
her
calm
brow
turreted
john
oh
pomp
of
proud
and
dire
idolatry
crete
other
sounds
thy
heard
far
other
sounds
when
on
his
seat
of
power
amid
the
altars
of
the
queen
of
love
the
christian
faith
there
touched
a
heathen
heart
paul
was
in
cyprus
the
proconsul
prayed
to
hear
of
faith
from
the
apostle
lips
but
elymas
withstood
him
elymas
the
sorcerer
he
beckoned
up
his
legions
dire
of
fierce
and
frowning
shadows
paul
unmoved
smote
him
amid
his
gaunt
and
grisly
troop
smote
him
with
instant
blindness
and
he
stood
dark
in
the
midday
sun
stranger
was
not
the
hand
of
god
so
visible
that
ships
of
tyre
might
bear
the
tidings
from
the
east
to
west
from

south
from

behold
the

of
ancient
egypt
scarce

john
replied
teacher
of
wisdom
or
from
heaven
or
earth
we
know
that
paul
our
brother
in
the
faith
proclaimed
the
tidings
of
him
crucified
from
rome
to
spain
but
paul
is
in
his
grave
soon
must
i
follow
him
and
be
at
rest
who
then
shall
bear
these
tiding
of
great
joy
to
all
the
people
of
all
lands
stranger
that
book
which
the
lamb
opened
as
a
flying
roll
angels
of
light
shall
bear
with
wings
unseen
from
shore
to
shore
and
thus
though
paul
be
dead
he
still
shall
speak
and
millions
yet
unborn
shall
bless
the
boon
thou
shalt
reveal
the
things
that
thou
hast
seen
but
that
same
book
which
none
in
heaven
or
earth
could
open
but
the
lamb
none
but
the
lamb
shall
close
awake
awake
ye
who
now
slumber
in
the
shades
of
death
yes
every
nation
shall
confess
the
lord
till
all
shall
be
fulfilled
and
there
shall
be
through
the
wide
world
one
shepherd
and
one
fold
for
deem
not
this
small
frith
called
the
great
sea
that
girds
yon
promontories
girds
the
world
without
is
the
great
ocean
the
main
sea
rocking
in
tempest
and
in
solitude
ten
thousand
isles
are
scattered
the
waste
of
those
dark
waters
and
each
isle
and
land
all
earth
shall
be
one
altar
and
from
earth
to
heaven
one
flame
of
incense
and
one
voice
of
prayer
and
praise
and
harmony
shall
rise
so
these
two
held
communion
on
the
shore
of
melancholy
patmos
when
a
sound
as
of
a
griding
chain
was
heard
and
lo
a
criminal
is
kneeling
at
the
feet
of
the
old
man
god
has
been
kind
to
me
he
cried
and
hid
his
forehead
with
his
hands
oh
listen
to
my
tale
and
pray
for
me
was
when
the
roman
sentinel
who
paced
the
platform
of
the
dungeon
where
we
slept
had
called
the
midnight
watch
and
overhead
bright
aldebaran
held
his
course
in
heaven
westering
yonder
cape
i
waked
and
mused
on
my
eventful
life
then
to
my
heart
came
words
which
i
had
heard
from
thee
i
wept
even
as
an
infant
and
i
smote
my
breast
the
brave
companion
of
my
fortunes
died
died
yesterday
stern
and
impenitent
as
he
lived
pitiless
and
left
alone
i
cried
for
mercy
mercy
of
that
god
whom
thou
didst
call
thy
father
and
i
prayed
to
christ
and
cried
me
me
oh
pardon
me
i
dare
not
lift
my
eyes
thou
father
hear
i
am
a
citizen
of
rome
my
name
pedanius
the
decurion
when
titus
led
his
legions
to
the
east
against
the
city
of
jerusalem
to
raze
it
from
the
earth
at
the
last
day
when
the
third
wall
shook
to
the
amid
the
shrieks
of
horror
and
despair
flung
from
the
tottering
battlements
a
babe
fell
at
my
horse
feet
famished
and
black
with
livid
lips
and
ghastly
on
the
ground
it
lay
when
frantic
from
the
crowd
within
a
wretched
and
bereaved
woman
rushed
and
held
my
bridle
fearless
of
the
swords
that
flashed
above
her
head
i
heard
her
cries
protect
me
he
is
dead
my
child
my
child
brave
soldier
for
the
love
of
god
i
looked
a
moment
there
was
famine
in
her
face
wasted
yet
beautiful
pitying
i
spoke
follow
and
through
the
clouds
of
smoke
we
passed
to
the
green
olive
trees
and
then
she
sank
upon
the
ground
and
pale
and
still
as
death
lay
long
the
winds
just
stirring
her
dark
hair
i
brought
her
water
from
the
spring
that
wells
soft
murmuring
from
the
brook
of
siloa
she
drank
and
feebly
opened
her
dark
eyes
which
seemed
more
large
for
all
her
flesh
was
shrunk
then
she
looked
up
and
faintly
spoke
again
my
mother
and
my
husband
and
my
child
are
and
she
sobbed
aloud
by
him
i
cried
who
rules
among
the
gods
i
will
protect
thy
life
with
mine
her
tears
fell
fast
and
warm
upon
the
bloody
hand
which
held
the
sword
the
other
checked
my
fierce
and
foaming
horse
hark
hark
a
turret
falls
hark
hark
again
they
shout
ten
thousand
voices
rend
the
skies
the
temple
the
proud
temple
to
the
ground
the
temple
the
proud
temple
to
the
dust
her
infant
she
had
taken
from
the
ground
to
lay
it
in
her
bosom
while
the
tears
fell
on
its
folded
hands
but
when
she
saw
still
its
wan
livid
lips
and
the
same
glare
of
its
dead
eyes
she
turned
away
her
face
half
looking
down
half
raised
to
heaven
and
shed
her
tears
no
more
one
hand
as
thus
she
sat
with
fingers
spread
held
fast
her
infant
arm
its
right
shoulder
while
its
arid
lips
she
drew
in
vain
towards
her
open
breast
still
fearing
to
look
down
her
other
hand
instinctively
she
laid
on
its
cold
feet
as
if
to
cherish
them
the
gouts
of
blood
fell
heavy
from
its
matted
hair
and
stained
her
bosom
but
she
had
composed
its
hands
which
now
though
cold
and
dead
each
other
clasped
beneath
her
neck
as
living
so
she
sat
nor
sighed
nor
moved
her
face
nor
shed
a
tear
i
gently
took
the
infant
from
her
arms
and
buried
it
beside
the
sacred
brook
and
then
with
muttered
prayer
she
turned
and
wept
wept
as
bereaved
of
all
she
loved
on
earth
fly
and
i
placed
her
on
the
horse
with
me
leaving
behind
the
sounds
and
sights
of
death
the
shrieks
of
massacre
the
crash
of
towers
falling
the
heavy
sound
of
we
passed
the
victims
blackening
in
the
sun
and
some
yet
breathing
on
the
crucifix
on
through
the
valley
of
jehoshaphat
i
spurred
my
horse
we
passed
the
sepulchre
of
lazarus
restored
from
the
dark
grave
so
those
who
own
the
faith
of
christ
affirm
with
ghastly
glaring
in
the
light
at
the
loud
voice
of
him
who
cried
come
forth
we
held
our
eastern
way
from
bethany
till
now
we
reached
the
plain
of
blood
i
paused
a
moment
ere
we
entered
that
sad
plain
ah
there
are
tents
upon
the
southern
edge
of
the
horizon
fly
it
is
the
camp
of
arabs
see
with
long
and
couched
spears
a
troop
is
flying
the
sands
we
hear
their
cries
this
way
they
rush
this
way
fly
fly
and
instant
as
an
arrow
speeds
my
pale
companion
breathless
and
scarce
held
we
bounded
the
desert
till
the
track
was
lost
the
voices
died
away
she
sank
faint
in
my
arms
and
with
her
head
declined
upon
my
breastplate
we
will
rest
a
while
for
she
was
now
so
feeble
it
behoved
thus
oft
to
rest
if
haply
she
might
feel
some
cool
reviving
airs
breathe
on
her
face
gently
a
few
dry
dates
were
all
our
food
we
gazed
in
silence
on
the
sun
that
red
was
sinking
now
beyond
the
lonely
sands
and
hurriedly
again
renewed
our
flight
the
track
is
lost
fear
not
those
are
the
bones
not
of
a
murdered
traveller
look
out
is
that
a
cloud
or
seest
thou
not
the
smoke
of
some
lone
cottage
on
the
hills
list
list
is
it
the
tinkle
of
some
rivulet
wandering
in
solitude
on
on
my
steed
we
reached
the
hills
and
looking
back
beheld
the
western
cope
of
heaven
as
night
came
down
all
fiery
red
it
was
the
light
far
off
of
the
proud
temple
flaming
through
the
night
we
held
our
toiling
way
when
at
gray
dawn
we
saw
beneath
us
palms
and
city
walls
and
jordan
slowly
flowing
to
the
south
yes
these
are
palms
and
walls
of
jericho
but
all
was
silent
and
forsaken
war
had
blown
his
trump
and
pity
at
the
blast
had
knelt
in
tears
and
hid
her
face
to
hear
that
deep
dire
groan
but
it
is
heard
no
more
for
silence
solitude
and
ruin
sit
mocking
each
other
at
the
city
gates
here
were
no
murmurs
of
tumultuous
life
we
joined
a
mourning
train
that
held
their
way
women
and
children
and
men
forlorn
by
jordan
banks
to
galilee
seeking
the
city
of
tiberias
with
many
tears
my
poor
companion
told
her
tale
a
daughter
of
jerusalem
implored
their
pity
and
the
daggers
raised
to
pierce
a
roman
soldier
to
the
heart
were
in
the
act
arrested
for
her
sake
trifosa
of
the
tribe
of
benjamin
who
owed
her
life
and
safety
to
his
sword
we
reached
the
city
here
she
had
a
friend
widowed
like
her
who
wept
to
hear
her
tale
here
wedded
and
by
israel
laws
made
one
i
lived
a
fisher
toiling
with
his
net
to
gain
our
daily
bread
but
soon
my
heart
beat
for
a
wider
scene
for
enterprise
the
soul
of
a
young
soldier
and
with
thoughts
stirring
and
restless
after
twelve
long
months
we
came
by
tabor
to
the
western
sea
i
had
a
robber
cavern
at
the
foot
of
carmel
and
oft
skirred
the
neighbouring
plains
on
my
fleet
with
spurs
of
blood
here
i
was
joined
by
soldiers
desperate
and
outcast
as
myself
we
were
a
band
of
secret
and
of
fearful
brotherhood
that
tenanted
these
caverns
but
my
wife
when
we
were
absent
and
the
cave
was
still
wept
for
the
love
of
those
who
were
no
more
trembled
and
wept
for
me
when
i
returned
weary
at
night
she
sat
and
sang
to
me
and
sometimes
when
she
was
alone
whole
days
she
wandered
the
mountains
gathering
flowers
hyacinths
lilies
and
anemones
and
when
my
hands
were
bloody
gave
me
them
with
trembling
hand
and
sadness
in
her
look
why
should
i
think
or
sigh
or
feel
remorse
was
i
not
leader
of
the
bravest
band
that
ever
shook
their
flashing
scymitars
against
the
morning
sun
but
oh
that
look
how
has
it
thrilled
even
to
my
inmost
heart
one
child
the
pledge
of
warm
affection
died
and
now
she
roved
in
morning
dew
no
more
and
oft
when
i
returned
with
brow
i
saw
a
strange
sad
wandering
in
her
eyes
alas
her
gentle
mind
was
gone
she
sang
she
gazed
upon
my
face
she
smiled
she
died
and
her
last
words
were
o
jerusalem
jerusalem
i
buried
her
in
peace
without
a
name
among
the
mountain
flowers
and
now
my
heart
was
hardened
as
a
rock
against
the
world
i
heard
no
soothing
voice
i
never
looked
upon
a
human
face
with
tenderness
again
a
darker
shade
of
passions
gathered
on
my
lonely
heart
till
love
and
charity
and
pity
died
i
may
not
say
what
i
have
seen
and
done
here
i
have
lived
a
fettered
slave
seven
years
here
thy
mild
voice
has
called
back
to
my
heart
sad
recollections
father
and
he
knelt
and
kissed
his
withered
hand
and
cried
again
oh
father
pray
for
me
the
stranger
stood
unmoved
but
tears
were
on
the
old
man
cheek
part
third
the
sounds
of
an
approaching
storm
vision
the
east
is
overcast
the
nearer
isles
are
hidden
by
a
sudden
spleen
the
clouds
upon
elijah
promontory
now
are
mustering
gloomily
there
is
a
sound
of
rain
and
as
with
interrupted
gusts
the
winds
are
rising
a
long
murmur
comes
more
hollow
from
the
seas
at
times
a
wail
at
distance
seems
to
mingle
with
the
wind
audibly
even
the
on
the
cliffs
cower
while
the
sounds
as
of
a
trump
are
heard
prophetical
and
sad
let
us
retire
for
sagittarius
rules
the
wayward
year
pensive
they
both
retired
into
the
cave
the
eyes
of
john
were
heavy
and
ere
long
he
sank
into
deep
slumber
like
a
child
hushed
by
the
ocean
sounds
and
now
arose
visions
more
dark
and
terrible
he
saw
the
lamb
of
god
open
the
book
hark
hark
the
thunder
and
the
tempest
roll
john
saw
four
cherubims
and
they
said
come
and
see
he
looked
and
behold
on
a
white
horse
sat
one
who
had
a
bow
and
he
there
was
crowned
and
with
his
bow
and
crowned
he
went
forth
conquering
and
to
conquer
hark
a
moan
comes
up
from
all
the
earth
the
second
seal
is
opened
and
the
second
cherubim
cries
come
and
see
behold
another
horse
and
it
is
red
and
he
who
sits
thereon
is
like
a
warrior
waving
in
his
hand
the
sword
of
slaughter
so
he
goeth
forth
to
kill
and
to
destroy
and
to
take
peace
from
all
the
earth
listen
for
the
third
seal
is
opening
now
and
the
third
cherubim
cries
come
and
see
then
said
a
voice
to
john
what
dost
thou
see
john
lo
a
black
horse
appears
its
rider
has
a
balance
in
his
hand
ride
on
ride
on
justice
and
equity
visit
the
earth
with
plenty
the
fourth
seal
is
opened
now
and
the
fourth
cherubim
cries
come
and
see
voice
what
seest
thou
john
a
pale
horse
voice
and
rider
john
yes
a
dire
anatomy
as
he
rides
on
nations
with
terror
shriek
death
and
the
gulf
of
hell
shoots
out
its
flame
after
the
footfall
of
that
ghastly
horse
the
rider
shouts
and
haggard
famine
crawls
with
wan
and
wasted
visage
from
her
cave
and
pestilence
speeding
unseen
in
air
breathes
and
ten
thousand
perish
and
wild
beasts
howl
in
the
city
of
the
dead
and
feed
upon
the
black
and
countless
carcases
low
thunders
rolled
and
sounds
of
woe
were
heard
when
the
fifth
seal
was
opened
and
john
saw
a
burning
altar
and
beneath
it
souls
of
those
who
had
been
slain
the
witnesses
confessing
christ
in
torments
and
they
cried
how
long
o
lord
holy
and
just
and
true
dost
thou
not
judge
judge
and
avenge
our
cause
and
robes
of
white
were
given
to
each
of
them
and
a
voice
said
oh
rest
ye
yet
a
while
rest
ye
till
persecution
cup
be
drained
the
judgment
leave
to
him
who
sits
in
heaven
the
thunders
louder
rolled
as
the
sixth
seal
was
opened
ah
the
sun
is
black
above
as
sackcloth
and
the
round
moon
red
as
blood
earth
rocks
from
east
to
west
the
stars
are
fallen
and
falling
as
the
casts
its
figs
when
shaken
by
the
mighty
hurricane
heaven
is
departing
like
a
scroll
the
kings
and
the
chief
captains
and
the
mighty
men
bondmen
and
free
have
hid
them
in
the
caves
and
mountains
and
dark
places
of
the
earth
and
to
the
mountains
and
the
rocks
they
cry
fall
on
us
hide
us
hide
us
from
the
face
of
the
incensed
lamb
for
his
great
day
of
wrath
is
come
and
who
on
earth
may
stand
and
after
this
john
saw
four
angels
stand
on
the
four
corners
of
the
earth
they
held
the
rushing
winds
that
not
a
wind
should
blow
tumultuous
on
the
earth
or
on
the
sea
whilst
they
stood
silent
then
with
radiant
wings
bright
as
the
sun
ascending
from
the
east
another
glorious
angel
came
who
bore
thy
seal
o
living
god
and
a
loud
voice
to
the
four
angels
cried
hurt
not
the
earth
or
seas
till
on
their
foreheads
we
have
sealed
the
servants
of
our
god
and
they
were
sealed
of
all
the
tribes
of
israel
after
this
a
multitude
which
no
man
on
the
earth
could
number
of
all
nations
and
all
tongues
clothed
in
white
robes
and
bearing
in
their
hands
palms
as
triumphant
stood
before
the
throne
of
glory
and
before
the
lamb
of
god
and
cried
aloud
salvation
to
our
god
which
sitteth
on
the
throne
and
to
the
lamb
and
all
the
angels
stood
about
the
throne
the
elders
and
the
mighty
cherubims
and
on
their
faces
fell
before
the
throne
and
worshipped
god
and
cried
aloud
amen
blessing
and
glory
wisdom
honour
power
be
to
our
god
for
ever
and
for
ever
then
seemed
that
one
among
the
elders
spake
to
john
and
said
what
are
these
multitudes
who
bear
triumphant
palms
all
clothed
in
white
john
answered
sir
thou
knowest
he
replied
these
are
victorious
saints
who
have
come
out
from
the
great
tribulation
and
have
washed
their
bloody
garments
and
have
made
them
white
white
through
his
blood
who
died
upon
the
cross
therefore
they
stand
before
the
throne
of
god
and
in
his
temple
serve
him
day
and
night
and
he
that
sitteth
on
the
throne
shall
dwell
among
them
they
shall
hunger
now
no
more
nor
thirst
the
sun
shall
cheer
them
but
not
burn
the
lamb
shall
feed
them
and
shall
lead
them
forth
to
pleasant
pastures
and
to
fountains
bright
and
from
their
eyelids
wipe
away
all
tears
for
ever
there
was
silence
in
the
heavens
when
the
seventh
seal
was
opened
and
john
saw
seven
angels
standing
by
the
throne
of
god
having
seven
trumpets
and
an
angel
came
who
hovering
with
a
golden
censer
stood
before
an
altar
and
the
smoke
went
up
of
incense
from
the
altar
these
are
prayers
of
all
the
saints
on
earth
prayers
which
ascend
like
incense
from
the
censer
in
the
hand
of
that
bright
angel
to
the
throne
of
god
ah
he
has
cast
his
censer
to
the
earth
and
suddenly
the
earthquake
and
the
storm
awoke
and
through
the
darkness
rolled
and
flashed
deep
thunders
and
the
lightning
and
behold
the
seven
angels
lift
their
trumpets
high
lift
and
prepare
to
sound
and
now
the
first
sounds
and
there
follows
instant
hail
and
fire
mingled
with
blood
which
on
the
earth
was
cast
so
that
the
trees
stood
bare
and
desolate
and
the
green
grass
was
withered
and
burnt
up
the
second
angel
sounded
and
behold
a
burning
mountain
cast
into
the
sea
the
third
part
of
all
creatures
in
the
sea
died
a
third
part
of
all
the
ships
that
sailed
upon
the
sea
was
smitten
and
destroyed
and
the
third
angel
sounded
and
there
fell
a
star
from
heaven
it
fell
on
the
third
part
of
rivers
and
the
fountains
of
the
deep
and
swollen
and
livid
carcases
were
left
weltering
beside
the
dark
sea
and
the
fourth
angel
sounded
and
the
sun
for
the
third
part
was
smitten
and
the
moon
for
the
third
part
was
darkened
and
john
saw
and
heard
an
angel
flying
in
mid
heaven
and
crying
with
a
mighty
voice
woe
woe
woe
to
the
earth
by
reason
of
the
voice
of
the
three
trumpets
that
are
yet
to
sound
and
the
fifth
trumpet
sounded
and
john
saw
a
star
fall
from
the
heavens
to
the
earth
and
to
the
angel
of
the
star
was
given
the
key
that
shuts
the
nethermost
abyss
upon
the
groans
of
those
that
groan
therein
the
pit
is
opened
and
the
volumed
smoke
shooting
red
flames
as
from
a
furnace
rolls
and
out
of
it
there
issued
crawling
things
like
scorpions
but
they
had
no
power
to
hurt
the
green
grass
of
the
earth
but
those
alone
who
on
their
foreheads
had
no
seal
of
heaven
these
shall
seek
death
but
find
him
not
for
death
shall
fly
from
them
when
they
most
pray
to
die
like
horses
trained
for
battle
a
dire
troop
comes
sounding
on
their
heads
are
crowns
like
gold
faces
are
theirs
like
men
and
they
have
hair
as
women
and
teeth
white
and
terrible
as
lions
and
their
iron
breastplates
shake
with
hurtling
noise
the
sounding
of
their
wings
is
as
the
chariots
and
the
steeds
of
war
rushing
to
the
thick
war
who
is
their
king
apollyon
angel
of
the
deep
abyss
one
woe
is
past
yet
two
more
woes
remain
for
the
sixth
angel
sounded
and
john
heard
a
voice
like
thunders
the
four
angels
loose
in
the
great
river
of
euphrates
bound
and
the
four
giant
angels
are
unbound
and
they
go
forth
to
slaughter
and
john
saw
the
horses
in
the
vision
and
he
saw
those
who
sat
on
them
with
breastplates
of
fire
of
jacinth
and
of
sulphur
and
the
heads
of
the
gaunt
horses
were
as
lions
heads
and
from
their
mouths
issued
red
fire
and
smoke
but
men
repented
not
nor
turned
away
from
their
dark
idols
or
their
sorceries
from
worshipping
their
gods
of
gold
or
stone
or
brass
or
silver
hush
the
sound
of
wings
another
mighty
angel
comes
from
heaven
and
lights
on
earth
clothed
in
a
radiant
cloud
there
is
a
rainbow
on
his
head
his
face
is
as
the
orient
sun
his
feet
appear
pillars
of
fire
in
his
right
hand
a
book
he
sets
his
right
foot
on
the
seas
his
left
upon
the
earth
and
cries
with
a
loud
voice
till
the
world
shrinks
and
when
he
thus
has
cried
seven
thunders
answer
uttering
to
heaven
their
voices
then
the
angel
said
to
john
art
thou
about
to
write
seal
up
the
things
which
the
seven
thunders
uttered
write
them
not
the
angel
which
john
saw
stand
on
the
seas
and
on
the
earth
raised
his
right
hand
to
heaven
and
swore
by
him
which
liveth
who
shall
live
for
ever
and
for
ever
swore
by
him
who
made
the
heaven
the
earth
and
all
therein
that
time
shall
be
no
more
the
mystery
of
god
shall
be
concluded
in
the
days
of
this
last
angel
voice
that
awful
voice
john
heard
entranced
and
the
voice
said
to
him
take
from
the
angel
hand
the
hand
of
him
who
standeth
on
the
seas
and
on
the
earth
that
book
thou
markest
open
in
his
hand
that
book
the
rapt
apostle
cried
that
book
the
angel
mildly
answered
let
thy
heart
feed
on
it
sweet
and
bitter
it
shall
be
and
thou
shalt
prophesy
of
things
to
come
of
dark
things
yet
to
be
upon
the
earth
the
seventh
angel
lifted
high
his
trump
and
sounded
when
from
heaven
a
voice
was
heard
the
kingdoms
of
this
world
they
are
become
the
kingdoms
of
our
lord
and
of
his
christ
for
ever
and
for
ever
he
shall
reign
for
ever
and
for
ever
now
the
ark
of
god
appeared
and
round
about
the
ark
there
was
a
rainbow
stealing
through
the
rain
the
ark
of
the
new
covenant
and
lo
a
shining
company
stood
with
the
lamb
upon
mount
zion
and
a
song
was
heard
of
harpers
harping
a
new
song
the
song
of
life
and
immortality
and
john
then
heard
a
voice
a
voice
from
heaven
which
said
write
write
from
henceforth
blessed
are
the
dead
which
in
the
lord
shall
die
for
they
shall
rest
from
all
their

blessed

the
dead
the
shadows
are
departed
horse
and
trump
are
seen
and
heard
no
more
the
trumpet
clang
dies
far
away
the
apostle
turned
and
prayed
with
eyes
upraised
and
now
for
pealing
trumps
heard
in
the
wind
the
lessening
sound
of
harps
still
lessening
and
still
lessening
till
the
cave
was
silent
and
the
stirring
winds
without
alone
were
heard
like
sweet
sad
melodies
remembered
in
old
times
whilst
he
who
stood
beside
him
watched
and
after
as
the
day
slowly
declined
they
two
conversing
sat
conversing
of
god
judgment
of
the
voice
which
said
to
man
the
sinner
dust
thou
art
and
unto
dust
thou
shalt
return
of
death
and
immortality
through
christ
restored
so
they
deceived
the
time
till
john
oppressed
with
sights
and
sounds
so
terrible
lay
down

sank

from

at
break

the

and
when
the
sun
arose
after
his
orisons
to

he
sat
on
the
rude
stone
before
his

marked
his

form
shadowed
against
the

watching
the
fitful

for
gainsaying
this
but
father
if
a
soldier
might
pronounce
with
all
respect
to
thy
gray
hairs
i
deem
the
sole
imperial
master
of
the
world
might
worthier
claim
that
title
than
a
man
mocked
scourged
ay
scourged
and
crucified
with
thieves
rose
and
ascended
into
heaven
replied
the
meek
old
man
a
hectic
on
his
cheek
rose
and
ascended
into
heaven
to
sit
at
the
right
hand
of
god
from
thence
to
come
judge
of
the
quick
and
dead
proud
soldier
hear
hear
how
a
prisoner
for
jesus
christ
can
answer
thee
when
king
agrippa
sat
upon
his
throne
in
oriental
state
surrounded
by
the
roman
soldiery
with
axe
and
fasces
of
imperial
sway
fair
berenice
seated
on
his
right
and
on
his
left
festus
the
governor
paul
a
poor
prisoner
of
jesus
christ
before
him
stood
in
chains
and
as
he
spoke
of
resurrection
and
the
world
to
come
he
cried
king
of
the
jews
dost
thou
believe
the
prophets
yes
i
know
thou
dost
believe
the
king
with
faltering
voice
tremblingly
cried
paul
paul
thou
dost
persuade
even
me
almost
to
be
a
christian
paul
with
lifted
hand
and
steadfast
look
thus
answered
him
almost
oh
would
that
the
whole
world
were
not
almost
but
altogether
such
as
i
am
now
except
these
bonds
soldier
i
say
the
same
but
hie
thee
to
thy
eagle
i
am
here
a
poor
old
man
like
paul
a
prisoner
and
thou
an
officer
of
mighty
rome
yet
would
i
pray
to
god
that
thou
be
oh
not
almost
but
altogether
such
as
i
am
now
except
these
few
gray
hairs
old
age
and
many
sorrows
yet
even
here
my
soul
hath
been
sustained
by
him
who
said
lo
i
am
with
you
alway
and
i
know
he
still
is
with
me
i
have
heard
his
voice
and
seen
his
look
of
glory
and
of
love
turned
on
me
in
this
solitude
and
he
he
who
did
shudder
with
me
at
the
voice
of
thy
bold
blasphemy
here
lately
came
with
words
of
comfort
and
these
aged
eyes
have
seen
the
things
that
must
hereafter
be
yet
know
stern
soldier
if
my
days
were
passed
lonely
as
hopeless
i
would
not
exchange
these
few
gray
hairs
for
thy
green
laurel
crown
this
solitude
for
living
c√¶sar
throne
or
c√¶sar
subject
world
the
soldier
turned
disdainful
and
his
crest
shook
in
the
wind
then
lifting
high
his
ensign
of
command
he
bade
the
trumpet
sound
the
second
watch
john
knelt
and
prayed
thy
kingdom
come
o
lord
then
he
who
stood
beside
him
spoke
unmoved
rome
rome
shall
be
no
more
at
dead
of
night
hark
the
barbarian
trump
jerusalem
shall
be
avenged
and
those
of
distant
days
pondering
the
fate
of
empires
there
shall
come
to
muse
upon
the
fragments
of
her
might
her
ancient
glory
passed
as
morning
clouds
and
tremble
for
the
judgments
of
the
lord
in
all
the
world
now
to
the
cave
retire
for
other
visions
of
the
things
to
come
and
other
fearful
shadows
must
thou
see
john
sat
and
held
his
hands
upon
his
brow
the
earth
seems
to
retire
and
all
the
sounds
of
tumult
and
of
woe
at
once
to
cease
then
john
was
in
the
spirit
and
he
saw
seven
angels
and
beneath
a
sea
of
glass
mingled
with
fire
and
on
the
sea
of
glass
those
who
had
gained
on
earth
the
victory
over
the
beast
all
standing
on
the
sea
of
glass
and
in
their
hands
the
harps
of
god
and
thus
they
sung
oh
great
and
marvellous
art
thou
almighty
god
and
just
and
true
are
all
thy
ways
thou
king
of
saints
amen
now
from
the
temple
a
loud
voice
was
heard
which
said
to
the
seven
angels
go
your
ways
pour
out
the
vials
of
the
wrath
of
god
upon
the
earth
then
on
the
men
which
bore
the
mark
upon
their
foreheads
of
the
beast
or
fell
down
to
his
image
noisome
sores
and
fell
the
second
angel
poured
his
vial
on
the
sea
and
it
became
the
blood
of
a
dead
man
and
every
thing
which
had
the
breath
of
life
died
in
the
sea
and
the
third
angel
poured
his
vial
out
upon
the
rivers
and
fresh
fountains
clear
and
they
became
red
blood
and
then
john
heard
in
trance
the
angels
of
the
waters
say
righteous
art
thou
o
lord
and
righteously
o
thou
which
art
and
was
and
which
shall
be
thus
hast
thou
judged
for
they
have
shed
the
blood
of
prophets
and
of
saints
a
voice
replied
from
out
the
altar
even
so
o
lord
almighty
god
thy
judgments
are
most
true
and
the
fourth
angel
poured
his
vial
out
upon
the
sun
and
power
was
given
to
him
to
scorch
men
with
the
fire
and
they
blasphemed
the
name
of
god
and
still
repented
not
looking
with
gnashing
teeth
upon
the
sun
and
the
fifth
angel
poured
his
vial
out
upon
the
kingdom
of
the
beast
and
lo
the
kingdom
of
the
beast
at
once
was
dark
but
men
repented
not
even
while
they
gnawed
their
tongues
for
pain
blaspheming
god
in
heaven
and
the
sixth
angel
poured
his
vial
out
where
the
great
river
of
euphrates
rolls
and
it
was
quick
dried
up
and
so
became
a
highway
for
the
armies
of
the
east
and
for
the
kings
of
earth
and
the
whole
world
gathering
to
battle
on
the
dreadful
day
of
the
incensed
lord
into
a
place
called
armageddon
in
the
hebrew
tongue
and
the
seventh
angel
poured
his
vial
out
into
the
air
and
a
loud
voice
was
heard
out
of
the
temple
inmost
shrine
which
cried
all
is
fulfilled
at
once
an
earthquake
shook
the
ground
and
lightnings
red
and
terrible
flashed
and
the
thunders
rolled
along
the
sky
and
strange
and
fearful
voices
in
the
air
were
heard
so
dreadful
was
that
storm
aghast
the
nations
fell
and
the
great
babylon
came
in
remembrance
before
god
to
pour
on
her
the
fierceness
of
his
wakened
wrath
and
now
john
saw
another
angel
fly
in
clouds
and
coming
down
with
power
from
heaven
unto
the
earth
and
all
the
earth
beneath
was
lighted
with
his
glory
and
he
cried
with
the
loud
voice
of
judgment
babylon
the
great
is
fallen
and
then
another
voice
answered
come
out
of
her
hath
she
not
said
i
sit
a
queen
mighty
as
ashtoreth
the
kings
of
earth
shall
tremble
when
they
see
the
smoke
of
her
great
torment
they
shall
stand
afar
off
from
her
burning
and
shall
cry
that
mighty
city
babylon
alas
in
one
hour
is
her
judgment
come
the
voice
of
harpers
and
of
trumpeters
no
more
shall
in
her
streets
be
heard
the
blood
of
saints
of
prophets
and
of
martyrs
is
avenged
the
cries
are
heard
the
smoke
is
seen
no
more
and
after
this
john
lifted
up
his
eyes
and
heard
the
voice
of
mighty
companies
which
sang
and
shouted
alleluia
reign
for
ever
lord
of
lords
and
king
of
kings
salvation
honour
glory
power
and
praise
be
unto
thee
o
lord
for
thou
hast
judged
with
righteousness
they
with
acclaiming
voice
still
sang
and
shouted
alleluia
reign
for
ever
lord
of
lords
and
king
of
kings
heard
through
the
empyrean
the
great
voice
again
went
up
whilst
all
the
courts
of
heaven
rang
alleluia
glory
be
to
thee
glory
and
power
lord
god
omnipotent
then
the
heaven
opened
and
behold
a
horse
as
white
as
snow
and
he
who
sat
thereon
was
called
true
and
faithful
on
his
head
were
crowns
on
crowns
and
underneath
a
name
which
no
man
knew
save
he
who
bore
that
name
his
vesture
was
a
robe
of
blood
and
they
who
followed
him
proclaimed
the
word
of
god
and
all
the
heavenly
armies
followed
him
on
horses
white
like
his
and
on
his
robe
was
written
king
of
kings
and
lord
of
lords
the
pomp
is
passed
and
now
john
raised
his
eyes
and
saw
an
angel
standing
in
the
sun
the
angel
in
his
watch
looked
down
to
earth
and
all
the
armies
of
the
earth
came
forth
to
war
with
the
bright
chivalry
of
heaven
and
him
who
sat
on
the
white
horse
and
lo
before
the
mighty
cherubims
advanced
michael
the
great
archangel
while
a
shout
rang
that
the
sun
in
heaven
might
seem
to
stand
still
at
a
sound
so
terrible
opposed
to
the
great
armies
of
the
living
god
frown
the
satanic
host
far
as
the
eye
can
reach
and
horses
black
as
night
and
spectre
armies
led
in
front
by
death
appear
receding
into
farther
depths
of
blackness
while
anon
a
dragon
scaled
moves
weltering
onward
michael
from
the
ranks
of
cherubim
advancing
lifts
on
high
his
mace
and
full
on
the
scaled
dragon
crest
smites
at
his
feet
the
dragon
lay
and
lo
the
sable
at
the
sight
are
vanished
raise
the
to
him
who
rides
on
the
white
horse
and
to
his
god
in
heaven
for
the
great
dragon
is
cast
down
into
the
bottomless
and
burning
lake
another
angel
with
white
waving
plume
descends
an
iron
chain
is
in
his
hand
and
the
dark
key
of
destiny
which
shuts
the
bottomless
abyss
from
whence
the
smoke
ascends
ascends
but
not
a
groan
is
heard
the
ancient
dragon
is
cast
down
and
bound
bound
for
a
thousand
years
in
chains
and
thrown
howling
into
that
nethermost
abyss
while
mercy
equity
and
peace
and
truth
like
angel
forms
visit
the
earth
and
move
radiant
as
light
among
the
sons
of
men
and
only
sounds
are
heard
of
harmonies
such
as
in
heaven
are
sung
about
the
throne
which
in
dewy
light
the
rainbow
bends
the
trump
of
bannered
war
the
sighs
and
groans
of
miserable
slaves
that
rise
from
earth
in
one
deep
murmur
to
high
heaven
are
ceased
for
love
and
mercy
walk
among
mankind
and
so
shall
walk
till
the
last
trump
shall
sound
now
a
new
heaven
and
new
earth
appear
and
coming
down
from
heaven
even
as
a
bride
adorned
to
meet
her
husband
john
beheld
the
city
of
the
new
jerusalem
glittering
beyond
the
clouds
and
then
he
heard
a
voice
from
a
bright
cloud
the
lord
shall
come
and
dwell
with
men
and
he
shall
be
their
god
and
god
shall
wipe
from
every
eye
the
tear
and
death
shall
be
no
more
john
spread
his
hands
and
cried
with
eyes
upraised
to
heaven
oh
stay
visions
of
bliss
i
am
bowed
down
with
age
forlorn
on
earth
and
i
have
tarried
long
alone
and
sad
oh
come
lord
jesus
christ
a
voice
replied
thou
shalt
be
where
he
is
hark
was
the
billow
beating
on
the
rocks
of
melancholy
patmos
and
john
wept
as
slowly
fading
like
a
summer
dream
he
saw
the
towers
and
gates
and
palaces
of
new
jerusalem
fade
in
the
clouds
of
eve
which
shot
its
gleaming
pinnacles
aloft
in
the
pale
sky
and
flushed
the
track
of
the
sun
westering
orb
with
crimson
light
as
the
sun
sunk
the
sound
of
trump
and
horn
shrilled
and
the
old
man
starting
from
his
trance
beheld
below
the
cave
the
roman
troop
stationed
to
guard
the
island
criminals
wind
slow
in
martial
file
with
banners
spread
returning
to
their
tents
ah
where
are
now
the
temples
of
the
new
jerusalem
glittering
amid
the
clouds
of
parting
day
gone
like
the
rack
and
patmos
dreary
isle
and
melancholy
caves
return
the
sound
of
marching
men
and
the
hoarse
roman
trump
the
apostle
to
the
entrance
of
his
cave
the
last
remaining
light
on
his
gray
hairs
comes
slowly
forth
and
rests
upon
his
staff
when
the
at
the
trump
disturbed
flew
to
his
withered
hand
with
plumed
crest
upon
his
brazen
helmet
holding
high
the
ensign
of
command
an
eagle
borne
before
him
on
a
spear
the
pr√¶fect
leads
his
legionary
band
and
as
aloft
the
banners
wave
and
shields
and
corslets
throw
back
a
pale
glimmer
mark
a
mournful
train
of
fettered
men
move
sullenly
with
whom
thoughtful
and
with
his
hands
upon
his
breast
his
eyes
at
times
uplifted
to
the
heavens
one
as
a
soldier
worn
with
toil
but
marked
with
a
stern
sadness
on
his
manly
brow
comes
silently
a
tear
on
his
dark
cheek
near
him
a
youth
wan
and
emaciate
leans
on
a
female
by
his
side
in
bloom
of
youthful
beauty
while
at
intervals
the
trumpet
ceased
to
ring
is
heard
the
breath
of
muttering
and
the
clank
of
chains
john
sighed
and
turning
to
the
stranger
said
for
both
were
at
the
entrance
of
the
cave
even
to
this
desert
spot
in
the
lone
waves
war
and
the
ensigns
and
the
sounds
of
war
have
reached
his
guest
illustrious
with
a
smile
answered
yet
this
is
the
mere
mimickry
of
that
appalling
spectacle
that
fills
the
world
wide
scene
with
havoc
and
with
blood
the
murmur
of
whose
mighty
coil
goes
up
still
to
the
ear
of
heaven
so
man
the
worm
preys
on
his
turn
from
the
earth
as
gradual
evening
shades
the
sinking
scene
and
think
upon
its
sins
and
strife
no
more
come
let
us
on
the
stone
before
the
cave
for
all
above
is
still
and
glorious
sit
down
and
watch
the
stars
as
they
steal
out
one
after
one
and
garnish
the
pale
cope
of
heaven
how
bright
the
troops
of
hesper
shine
above
the
shadow
of
yon
farther
rock
whose
western
side
is
lustrous
for
the
moon
ascending
in
her
car
of
glory
casts
a
meditative
and
a
solemn
light
from
cape
to
cape
look
there
is
helice
watched
by
the
grecian
traders
of
the
deep
how
clear
she
shines
above
the
sea
high
in
the
zenith
here
and
there
apart
some
solitary
stars
now
scarce
discerned
seem
to
retire
into
the
farthest
space
as
if
to
shun
the
prouder
planet
gaze
each
in
his
watch
with
eye
steadfast
nor
marvel
then
the
stranger
said
when
all
the
silent
host
of
the
blue
sky
appear
so
beautiful
idolatry
should
deem
them
gods
and
to
the
sun
and
moon
bel
and
astarte
pay
the
worship
due
to
the
invisible
almighty
lord
who
rules
in
heaven
and
earth
is
there
a
god
yes
nature
cries
aloud
there
a
god
visible
in
his
works
and
infinite
in
power
there
is
a
god
and
he
is
just
there
is
a
god
and
he
is
merciful
yet
might
we
rather
say
there
is
no
god
than
think
that
to
a
being
such
as
man
no
revelation
of
bright
hope
was
given
that
man
created
in
god
image
placed
amid
this
vast
and
unknown
universe
to
sojourn
upon
earth
a
few
brief
years
of
feverish
life
should
look
for
the
last
time
hopeless
upon
the
setting
sun
and
die
oh
better
be
the
worm
that
feeds
on
him
with
lifted
gaze
the
last
apostle
cried
fervently
cried
oh
yes
lord
jesus
christ
thou
art
the
christian
hope
but
most
of
me
of
me
whom
thou
hast
visited
and
cheered
through
life
long
pilgrimage
of
me
of
me
in
age
and
solitude
i
too
shall
live
when
all
the
clouds
of
time
are
rolled
away
for
ever
live
in
glory
where
thou
art
retiring
to
the
cave
pausing
he
turned
to
his
companion
but
he
was
not
there
the
moon
shone
but
there
was
no
form
or
shape
of
living
thing
so
lonely
to
his
cave
john
retired
there
musing
lay
on
what
he
saw
and
heard
till
sleep
unawares
oppressed
him
and
that
night
that
only
night
he
had
not
fallen
upon
his
knees
and
prayed
protect
me
through
this
night
o
lord
my
god
when
suddenly
a
hiss
was
heard
without
and
the
dull
hurtle
as
of
iron
wings
and
short
and
intermitted
flames
at
times
lighted
the
cavern
roof
then
all
again
was
dark
save
when
the
moon
dilated
hung
and
all
again
was
still
john
heavy
eyes
were
closed
and
dreaming
half
and
half
awake
he
slumbered
in
the
cavern
who
art
thou
starting
he
cried
and
trembled
for
strange
eyes
glared
through
the
dusk
and
seemed
to
look
at
him
it
was
the
coinage
of
the
aged
brain
when
sadness
and
the
sense
of
loneliness
oppress
the
weary
heart
his
eyes
are
closed
a
moment
when
strange
voices
in
the
air
syllable
words
unknown
as
mocking
him
then
all
is
hushed
again
from
the
dark
roof
fantastic
and
deriding
shapes
half
seen
point
down
long
fingers
and
a
laugh
is
heard
from
the
dark
fissure
of
the
rocky
cave
till
even
his
shadow
by
a
seen
seems
joining
the
fantastic
mockery
strange
forms
of
beasts
and
birds
with
monstrous
beaks
solemnly
nodding
in
the
dusk
appear
yonder
by
moonlight
all
with
heads
hung
down
there
moves
a
shrouded
and
a
moping
train
but
not
a
form
distinctly
visible
save
of
a
corpse
that
silently
they
bear
on
which
the
moonlight
falls
now
a
dark
cloud
is
interposed
and
the
dim
troop
dissolves
forthwith
a
spectre
towering
to
the
skies
moves
onward
on
directly
to
the
cave
and
towering
higher
as
he
moves
he
lifts
half
cloud
and
half
anatomy
a
dart
barbed
with
fire
and
a
deep
voice
is
heard
through
the
involving
clouds
about
his
head
i
am
apollyon
dost
thou
sleep
old
man
tremble
and
die
john
raised
his
eyes
and
prayed
still
shuddering
save
me
save
me
jesus
christ
the
spectre
vanished
some
faint
lightning
shone
at
distance
and
now
gentler
forms
drew
nigh
with
airy
minstrelsy
of
harps
unseen
surrounding
him
like
shadows
of
the
blessed
here
radiant
female
forms
came
gliding
by
there
in
a
stream
of
light
an
angel
turned
his
look
upon
him
while
soft
voices
sing
christian
dost
thou
yet
remain
in
this
weary
world
of
pain
dost
thou
bend
thy
hoary
head
when
all
beloved
on
earth
are
dead
hast
thou
oft
by
years
oppressed
prayed
for
rest
eternal
rest
lo
we
come
ere
morning
peep
to
sing
thee
to
thy
rest
asleep
echo
from
the
cave
asleep
voices
asleep
sing
thee
to
thy
rest
asleep
echo
asleep
then
came
another
song
like
lullabies
of
ocean
mingled
with
the
airs
of
night
whilst
a
mother
only
child
rests
in
short
and
sweet
repose
all
her
troubles
are
beguiled
when
its
placid
eyelids
close
but
angels
watch
beside
the
bed
where
aged
christians
rest
their
head
and
as
their
watchful
vigils
cease
parting
they
whisper
peace
echo
from
the
cave
peace
parting
voices
peace
tired
nature
sank
to
sleep
like
infancy
and
as
calm
then
in
a
dream
the
shades
of
mitred
and
majestic
james
peter
and
paul
came
up
he
heard
their
voice
and
saw
their
forms
as
when
they
lived
on
earth
james
looked
upon
his
beard
of
snow
and
said
we
have
borne
witness
to
the
truth
in
blood
but
thy
old
age
shall
calmly
pass
away
till
death
be
lost
in
sleep
then
thou
shalt
wake
in
everlasting
bliss
to
weep
no
more
for
he
whom
thou
hast
seen
shall
be
with
thee
and
we
shall
live
together
where
he
is
after
a
placid
and
refreshing
sleep
the
last
apostle
raised
his
eyes
and
saw
the
same
majestic
and
mysterious
man
who
stood
before
him
in
the
cave
and
now
the
dim
dawn
broke
on
the
√¶gean
deep
part
fifth
ascend
the
highest
mountain
comparison
with
the
vision
on
mount
tabor
transfiguration
view
to
east
and
west
ship
descried
from
the
east
descend
john
gazing
on
the
glimmering
eastern
surge
sat
with
fixed
eyes
when
thus
the
stranger
spake
up
for
the
word
and
spirit
of
the
lord
are
come
to
me
let
us
ascend
old
man
the
summit
of
elijah
cliff
that
hangs
high
the
ocean
surge
and
see
the
sun
rise
the
√¶gean
solitude
john
answered
can
these
feeble
limbs
sustain
the
labour
up
the
long
and
slow
ascent
step
by
step
when
i
feel
my
strength
decay
daily
and
draw
my
breath
with
pain
thy
god
will
give
thee
strength
the
stranger
said
and
took
his
trembling
hand
and
led
his
feeble
step
slow
up
the
hill
and
ever
as
they
went
and
the
horizon
widened
in
his
heart
john
felt
a
strange
reviving
power
that
braced
his
sinews
and
gave
a
vigour
to
his
steps
conquering
the
pain
and
labour
of
the
way
but
needs
not
pain
or
labour
for
a
thought
hath
brought
them
there
the
white
hairs
in
the
wind
of
john
yet
gently
stirring
and
his
cheek
just
lighted
with
a
transient
glow
and
now
both
stood
upon
the
promontory
point
thoughtful
and
silent
soon
they
saw
the
sun
slowly
emerging
a
vast
orb
of
fire
above
the
shadowy
edge
of
ocean
now
flaming
direct
asia
with
a
stream
of
long
illumination
on
the
clouds
marked
with
confusion
of
rich
hues
and
thence
touching
the
nearer
promontory
height
pale
cliffs
and
eagles
wings
above
the
clouds
and
now
careering
through
the
heaven
supreme
full
and
magnificent
in
loneliness
of
glory
when
the
rays
first
touched
his
brow
then
more
exalted
and
of
larger
frame
the
stranger
seemed
to
grow
as
not
of
earth
or
earth
inhabitants
so
tall
his
form
so
glorified
his
aspect
john
had
fallen
upon
his
knees
but
a
mild
voice
rebuked
see
that
thou
do
it
not
hast
thou
received
or
strength
or
comfort
give
the
thanks
to
god
john
resting
on
the
crag
of
the
wild
rock
looked
up
and
then
to
his
companion
spoke
not
uninstructive
hath
thy
converse
been
nor
unrefreshing
to
my
weary
heart
thy
presence
more
so
in
a
scene
like
this
raised
as
it
were
above
the
shade
and
clouds
of
transient
time
and
so
long
since
my
soul
felt
a
divine
refreshment
when
i
stood
upon
the
mount
of
vision
with
our
lord
that
day
when
in
transfigured
form
he
rose
oh
well
do
i
remember
it
who
saw
with
james
and
peter
by
the
sight
oppressed
the
glorious
apparition
each
stray
cloud
wandered
far
off
and
lost
in
the
blue
sky
and
not
a
freckle
stained
the
firmament
high
overhead
the
mystic
mount
itself
tabor
seemed
rising
up
to
heaven
and
loomed
in
such
illumination
that
the
track
below
and
all
the
plains
of
galilee
rivers
and
lake
to
the
great
western
sea
looked
cold
and
dim
even
in
the
morning
sun
such
was
the
glory
of
the
sudden
blaze
that
wrapped
the
mount
the
crowd
of
lesser
hills
on
to
the
city
of
tiberias
appeared
below
which
the
eagle
sailed
mute
for
his
eyes
yet
blenched
from
the
excess
of
light
unlike
the
sun
that
startled
him
with
bursting
splendour
where
he
slept
he
flew
high
soaring
the
hills
of
jezreel
on
to
the
mountains
of
samaria
we
fell
upon
the
ground
and
with
our
hands
covered
our
faces
when
we
raised
our
eyes
we
saw
three
glorified
appearances
two
as
of
aged
prophets
with
their
beards
streaming
each
held
a
book
and
in
the
midst
and
buoyant
in
the
air
his
countenance
bright
as
the
sun
our
saviour
form
appeared
above
them
while
his
vest
intensely
white
floated
as
thus
transfigured
he
arose
with
clasped
hands
and
eyes
upraised
to
heaven
peter
in
joy
and
wonder
ardently
cried
let
us
build
three
tabernacles
here
to
moses
and
elias
and
to
thee
saviour
and
god
not
knowing
what
he
said
a
cloud
now
interposed
between
the
light
softening
its
glory
while
a
voice
was
heard
from
the
bright
cloud
lo
my
beloved
son
hear
him
at
once
the
shadowy
imagery
the
visionary
pomp
the
radiant
cloud
were
rolled
away
and
jesus
stood
alone
for
they
who
held
high
converse
and
whose
forms
appeared
in
thinner
air
above
the
blaze
were
gone
with
the
departing
cloud
his
hand
he
placed
upon
our
heads
and
said
fear
not
and
that
calm
look
of
dignity
and
love
was
placed
upon
us
as
before
again
we
saw
the
sun
the
cloudless
cope
of
heaven
the
long
green
valley
of
esdraelon
the
pines
of
dewy
hermon
and
the
smoke
of
nain
where
once
a
widowed
mother
wept
her
lost
and
only
son
whom
jesus
raised
from
death
cold
sleep
restoring
to
her
tears
of
joy
we
saw
the
cavern
and
the
cliffs
of
endor
where
the
called
up
from
his
sleep
of
death
the
prophet
old
to
tell
to
trembling
saul
his
hour
was
come
oh
hills
and
streams
and
plains
of
palestine
scenes
where
we
heard
long
since
our
master
voice
and
saw
his
face
how
often
with
a
tear
have
i
remembered
you
how
often
sighed
oh
for
the
swiftness
of
an
eagle
wing
that
i
might
flee
away
and
visit
you
once
more
but
this
great
vision
of
the
mount
with
shadowings
of
glory
was
displayed
that
we
might
be
sustained
in
the
dread
day
of
trial
when
the
very
rocks
should
burst
when
through
deep
darkness
the
loud
cry
should
come
my
god
my
god
hast
thou
forsaken
me
that
we
might
be
prepared
through
every
ill
in
peril
and
in
pain
in
life
in
death
though
persecution
famine
and
the
sword
fronted
our
way
prepared
to
hold
right
on
calm
to
take
up
our
cross
and
follow
him
who
meekly
bowed
his
head
upon
that
cross
for
if
in
this
life
only
we
had
hope
we
were
of
all
most
miserable
lord
thee
have
i
followed
now
in
age
and
poor
thy
sufferings
were
for
us
for
us
for
me
for
me
thy
bleeding
side
was
pierced
for
me
thy
spirit
groaned
oh
come
lord
jesus
christ
oh
come
for
i
have
tarried
long
on
earth
come
lord
and
saviour
have
i
prayed
in
vain
thou
didst
appear
in
glory
on
the
mount
and
thou
hast
come
even
now
and
cried
fear
not
i
live
for
evermore
and
have
the
keys
of
death
and
hell
and
wherefore
should
i
fear
now
waiting
only
to
depart
in
peace
but
i
have
wandered
in
my
thoughts
this
view
from
this
high
mountain
and
congenial
thoughts
have
waked
the
memory
of
that
vision
bright
when
once
we
saw
above
the
clouds
of
earth
our
lord
in
glistening
apparel
shine
then
he
who
stood
upon
the
mountain
van
with
john
and
gazed
upon
the
seas
below
said
look
towards
the
east
what
dost
thou
see
john
answered
there
is
nothing
but
the
clouds
and
seas
and
both
were
silent
stranger
look
again
john
answered
there
is
nothing
but
the
clouds
and
seas
and
the
great
sun
above
the
waves
that
goeth
forth
in
beauty
stranger
look
again
john
answered
yes
upon
the
farthest
line
of
the
blue
there
is
a
speck
of
light
no
yes
there
is
a
distant
sail
in
sight
it
seems
as
speeding
hitherward
stranger
enough
look
to
the
west
what
seest
thou
there
john
ah
all
that
hid
the
vast
and
various
scene
slowly
withdraws
like
morning
mist
i
see
regions
in
light
and
shade
beyond
the
isles
delos
and
mycone
mountains
and
capes
unfolding
through
the
mist
as
if
they
stood
beneath
our
feet
there
bays
and
gulfs
and
plains
and
wandering
streams
appear
and
them
high
upon
a
hill
in
the
pale
atmosphere
a
temple
vast
as
of
some
god
renowned
in
pagan
lands
stranger
thou
seest
the
shores
of
greece
and
that
the
illustrious
city
so
renowned
athens
upon
that
hill
the
hill
of
mars
paul
stood
when
pointing
to
the
skies
above
he
spoke
of
fanes
not
made
with
hands
of
god
who
liveth
in
the
heaven
what
seest
thou
more
john
another
land
stretched
like
a
giant
arm
across
the
deep
with
seas
on
either
side
there
on
seven
hills
i
see
a
city
crowned
with
glittering
domes
the
nether
champagne
spread
with
aqueducts
and
columns
arches
and
towers
stranger
it
is
the
imperial
mistress
of
the
world
rome
rome
now
pagan
but
a
power
unknown
shall
rise
and
throned
on
those
seven
hills
when
c√¶sars
moulder
with
their
palaces
shall
hold
dominion
the
prostrate
world
not
by
their
glittering
legions
but
the
power
of
cowled
superstition
that
shall
keep
kingdoms
and
kings
in
thrall
till
with
a
shout
a
brighter
angel
from
the
heaven
of
heavens
as
ampler
knowledge
shoots
her
glorious
beams
shall
open
the
lamb
book
again
and
night
beckoning
her
dismal
shadows
and
dark
birds
fly
hooting
from
the
dayspring
of
that
dawn
burns
not
thy
heart
to
think
upon
those
days
but
long
and
dire
shall
be
the
tale
of
blood
let
it
be
hid
for
ever
look
again
john
i
see
the
pillars
and
the
rocky
bounds
that
gird
this
inland
sea
stranger
what
seest
thou
more
john
i
see
a
ship
burst
through
the
narrow
frith
into
the
sea
of
darkness
and
of
storms
there
lost
in
boundless
solitudes
oh
no
there
is
an
island
with
its
chalky
cliffs
beauteous
it
rises
from
the
billowy
waste
stranger
thither
that
ship
is
bound
nor
storms
nor
seas
rocking
in
more
terrific
amplitude
impede
its
course
long
years
shall
roll
away
and
when
deep
night
shall
wrap
again
the
shores
of
asia
where
the
golden
candlestick
now
gleams
illumining
the
pagan
world
and
where
a
few
poor
christian
fishermen
shall
here
and
there
be
found
even
where
thy
church
of
ephesus
stood
in
the
light
of
heaven
from
that
far
isle
amid
the
desert
waves
back
like
the
morning
on
the
darkened
east
to
lands
long
hid
in
unknown
the
radiance
of
the
gospel
shall
go
forth
and
the
cross
float
triumphant
the
world
john
even
now
in
vision
rapt
of
days
to
come
i
see
her
christian
temples
pale
in

above
the
smoke
of
cities
the
deep
i
see
her
fleets
innumerable
spread
chequering
like

lo
a

winding
in
the
light
silent
amid
a
vast
metropolis
beneath
the
spires
and

and
glittering
domes
ah
they
are
vanished
and
a
sudden
cloud
hides
from
the
straining
sight

ah

descended
silently

towards

there

thus

among

didst
thou
not

a

youth
and
by
his
side
oft
looking
in

altered
face
with

a

grecian

he
was
one
who
crowned
his
hair
with
roses
trod
the
path
of
love
and
pleasure
till
the

fled
and
left
him
here
an

left
the
woods
the
hills
and
shores
of
greece
to
seek
a
in
asia
at
tyre
or
smyrna
but
the
tempest
rose
and
cast
his
vessel
on
the
rocky
coast
of
cyprus
i
was
found
upon
the
shore
escaped
i
know
not
how
for
he
was
dead
and
pitying
strangers
bore
me
to
the
fane
of
paphian
venus
there
my
infancy
grew
up
in
opening
beauty
like
the
rose
ere
summer
has
unfolded
it
i
looked
upon
the
dove
blue
eyes
how
sorrowful
that
it
must
die
upon
the
altar
die
and
then
it
seemed
still
dearer
and
i
heard
its
murmuring
on
my
bosom
with
a
tear
kissing
it
but
a
young
athenian
whom
epicurus
taught
that
life
sweet
prime
was
like
the
rose
for
whom
anacreon
sang
let
us
seize
the
moments
as
they
fly
and
bind
our
brows
with
clusters
of
the
vine
roaming
in
summer
the
√¶gean
deep
enticed
me
from
the
shrines
of
her
i
served
and
led
me
with
him
for
he
had
a
boat
charmed
by
the
syrens
led
from
isle
to
isle
joyous
and
reckless
were
his
youthful
crew
their
hair
with
myrtle
and
with
roses
wreathed
who
dipped
the
oar
in
cadence
to
the
sound
of
dulcimer
and
tambourine
and
lute
while
damsels
like
immortal
goddesses
their
light
hair
gently
waving
to
the
breath
of
summer
in
the
bloom
and
light
of
youth
sang
with
accord
of
dulcet
harmony
as
if
to
charm
the
seas
and
cupid
sat
aloft
his
small
right
hand
upon
the
helm
while
with
the
left
he
loosed
the
purple
sail
free
to
the
morning
zephyrs
so
we
sailed
with
music
on
the
waters
sailed
along
and
thought
not
of
the
sounds
of
a
sad
world
we
had
forsaken
while
the
lute
thus
woke
the
echoes
of
the
listening
cyclades
go
tell
that
pining
boy
to
cast
his
willow
wreath
away
for
though
life
spring
too
soon
is
past
though
youth
sweet
roses
fade
too
fast
they
shall
not
fade
nay
father
frown
not
thus
like
withering
care
he
who
is
old
may
yet
remember
hours
of
happiness
like
these
and
will
forgive
and
wilt
not
thou
my
father
wilt
not
thou
from
cyprus
island
of
the
queen
of
love
we
came
to
naxos
and
i
joined
the
train
of
bacchanals
still
singing
as
we
danced
upon
the
mountains
to
the
bell
and
pipe
evoe
bacchus
thence
we
sailed
away
careless
in
the
bright
sunshine
of
the
morn
and
never
thought
the
tempest
would
arise
to
cloud
our
happy
days
but
hark
the
storm
of
night
is
howling
round
us
not
a
star
in
heaven
appears
to
light
our
wintry
way
alas
the
pinnace
with
its
company
was
dashed
upon
the
rocks
of
attica
where
stern
minerva
stood
and
with
her
spear
shivered
it
into
fragments
at
her
feet
cast
on
the
shore
again
i
sought
the
fane
of
her
i
served
in
paphos
and
once
more
danced
round
the
altars
of
the
queen
of
love
he
scarce
escaping
all
his
substance
gone
joined
the
and
of
late
i
heard
was
banished
to
this
isle
a
criminal
wasted
by
slow
disease
and
soon
to
die
my
father
i
have
heard
that
thou
canst
call
spirits
from
heaven
of
such
strange
potency
they
can
awake
the
dead
restore
to
life
the
dying
oh
restore
the
youth
i
loved
and
bring
the
rose
to
his
pale
cheek
again
john
unhappy
child
the
path
of
pleasure
leads
to
sorrow
in
this
world
and
in
the
next
grecian
girl
the
next
the
next
my
father
i
have
heard
that
thou
dost
worship
a
new
god
a
god
who
has
no
priestess
i
can
dance
and
sing
light
as
euphrosyne
and
i
can
weep
for
pity
and
can
sigh
how
tenderly
for
love
and
if
thou
wilt
restore
that
youth
to
health
and
love
oh
i
will
kneel
to
thee
and
offer
sacrifice
morning
and
eve
to
thy
great
god
and
weave
a
coronal
when
i
have
culled
the
choicest
flowers
of
rhodes
father
to
crown
those
few
white
hairs
of
thine
john
answered
i
will
pray
for
him
and
thee
but
leave
me
child
now
leave
me
to
those
prayers
the
man
of
loftier
wisdom
spoke
again
how
sing
the
thoughtless
in
their
songs
of
joy
our
days
of
happiness
at
best
are
short
and
profitless
and
in
the
death
of
man
there
is
no
remedy
for
we
are
born
and
we
shall
sleep
hereafter
in
the
dust
as
we
had
never
been
so
all
our
days
are
vanity
our
breath
but
as
a
smoke
a
vapour
and
we
turn
again
to
earth
and
this
high
spirit
vanishes
in
air
into
thin
air
our
very
name
shall
be
forgotten
and
oblivion
on
our
works
sit
silent
while
our
days
have
sped
away
as
clouds
that
leave
no
trace
or
as
a
mist
dispersed
and
scattered
by
the
noonday
sun
time
is
itself
the
shadow
of
a
shade
hurrying
and
when
our
tale
of
days
is
told
the
tomb
is
sealed
and
who
ever
rose
to
stand
again
beneath
the
light
of
day
then
let
us
crown
with
rosebuds
ere
they
fade
our
brows
and
pass
no
blooming
flower
of
spring
such
heartless
sophistries
have
still
deceived
earth
poor
wayfarers
they
who
know
not
god
for
god
created
man
oh
not
to
die
eternally
but
live
for
ever
live
so
he
be
found
holy
and
just
and
pure
the
image
of
himself
what
dost
thou
see
thine
eyes
are
fixed
and
turned
on
vacancy
john
said
i
see
the
dead
both
great
and
small
stand
before
god
the
loud
archangel
trump
hath
ceased
to
thunder
the
bursting
graves
how
deep
how
dread
the
silence
as
that
book
is
opened
ah
there
is
another
book
stranger
it
is
the
book
of
life
the
dead
are
judged
according
to
their
works
john
above
the
throne
interminable
space
of
glorious
light
is
spread
and
and
hierarchies
with
golden
harps
into
the
depths
of
that
interminable
light
recede
till
the
tired
vision
shrinks
the
sea
the
sea
gives
up
its
dead
and
death
and
hell
pour
forth
all
hushed
and
pale
their
countless
multitudes
shivering
to
meet
the
light
and
millions
pray
in
silence
hide
us
hide
us
earth
again
a
gulph
beneath
them
black
as
tenfold
night
glaring
at
times
with
intermittent
flames
opens
and
hark
sad
sounds
and
shrieks
of
woe
come
through
the
darkness
at
the
dreadful
voice
depart
from
me
ye
cursed
john
amazed
looked
he
saw
the
blue
√¶gean
shine
and
the
approaching
sail
white
in
the
wind
then
he
who
stood
by
him
thus
spoke
awake
let
us
toward
the
sea
for
look
the
ship
approaches
nearer
to
the
eastern
bay
as
near
and
still
more
near
she
speeds
her
course
on
this
gray
column
prostrate
in
the
dust
its
tale
unknown
the
sole
sad
relic
here
of
perishable
glory
and
who
knows
perhaps
a
pillar
of
some
marble
fane
raised
to
dark
pagan
idols
let
us
rest
and
muse
upon
the
change
of
mortal
things
the
apostle
sat
and
as
he
watched
the
sail
leaned
on
his
staff
to
hear
the
stranger
spoke
lo
the
last
fragment
of
departed
days
this
shaft
of
a
fallen
column
and
even
so
shall
all
the
monuments
of
human
pride
be
smitten
to
the
desert
dust
like
those
who
raised
them
long
to
desert
dust
returned
where
are
the
hundred
gates
of
regal
thebes
let
the
clouds
answer
and
the
silent
sands
where
is
the
tower
of
babel
proudly
raised
as
to
defy
the
lord
above
the
clouds
he
raised
his
arm
and
as
a
dream
it
sank
waters
of
babylon
by
thy
sad
shores
the
children
of
captivity
sat
down
sat
down
and
wept
when
they
remembered
thee
o
sion
but
the
trump
and
cornet
bray
it
is
belshazzar
midnight
feast
he
sits
a
god
among
his
lords
and
concubines
a
thousand
torches
flame
aloof
the
songs
of
wantonness
and
blasphemy
go
up
and
are
those
golden
vessels
from
the
shrine
and
temple
of
the
living
god
brought
forth
in
impious
derision
does
the
hymn
resound
to
baal
and
the
gods
of
gold
and
at
this
hour
do
all
the
princes
rise
is
the
wine
poured
from
vessels
which
the
lord
had
consecrated
do
they
drink
and
cry
the
king
shall
live
for
ever
ah
how
changed
his
countenance
he
trembles
and
his
knees
smite
one
against
the
other
look
how
changed
god
of
eternal
justice
what
is
that
the
fingers
of
a
man
against
the
wall
moving
in
shadow
and
inscribing
words
of
dreadful
import
but
which
none
may
read
call
the
chaldeans
and
astrologers
are
they
all
mute
call
the
poor
captive
slave
daniel
the
prophet
of
the
lord
the
crowd
all
turn
their
looks
in
silence
with
their
breath
hushed
by
their
terrors
has
he
spoken
yes
thy
sceptre
is
departed
hear
o
king
he
hears
and
trembles
and
that
very
night
he
who
blasphemed
is
gone
to
meet
his
judge
proclaim
the
conquering
persian
it
was
god
who
led
his
armies
forth
who
called
his
name
cyrus
and
under
him
again
shall
rise
the
temple
at
jerusalem
shall
rise
in
beauty
and
in
glory
till
the
day
of
tribulation
smite
it
to
the
earth
as
we
have
seen
weep
for
jerusalem
but
in
the
light
of
heaven
the
church
of
christ
shall
lift
its
battlements
till
he
shall
come
with
all
his
jubilant
acclaiming
hosts
amid
the
clouds
the
old
man
raised
his
eyes
and
on
his
forehead
placed
his
withered
hand
a
moment
musing
then
he
turned
his
look
again
to
his
companion
at
his
side
ah
he
is
gone
but
hark
a
rustling
sound
is
heard
and
bright
above
the
eastern
cliffs
behold
a
glorious
angel
pennons
spread
look
he
ascends
into
the
azure
depth
of
light
he
still
ascends
till
the
blue
sky
is
only
interrupted
by
some
clouds
of
lightest
brede
and
beauty
the
sea
transparent
hung
john
gazed
with
hands
outspread
but
nothing
in
the
airy
track
was
seen
save
those
small
clouds
then
pensive
he
sat
down
his
withered
hands
extending
as
in
prayer
but
lo
the
vessel
drops
its
sail
a
boat
is
hurrying
smooth
and
rapid
through
the
spray
the
sounds
of
men
are
heard
see
they
approach
yes
they
are
messengers
of
peace
they
come
with
tidings
to
the
lonely
habitant
two
elders
of
the
church
of
ephesus
greet
him
with
salutations
from
the
ship
whose
banner
streams
the
banner
of
the
cross
beneath
the
rocks
of
patmos
from
the
beach
the
elders
slow
advanced
and
one
thus
spoke
hail
father
c√¶sar
is
no
more
thy
church
at
ephesus
again
by
us
implores
thy
presence
and
thy
guidance
and
behold
the
bark
now
waits
to
bear
thee
the
deep
for
nerva
has
reversed
the
stern
decree
passed
for
thy
banishment
arise
return
return
for
now
the
light
of
heaven
again
gleams
on
the
temple
of
our
infant
faith
the
radiance
of
the
golden
candlestick
that
shone
in
the
deep
darkness
of
the
earth
shall
flame
more
bright
arise
arise
return
john
took
their
hands
and
blessing
them
gave
thanks
to
god
who
rules
above
then
cried
i
go
with
many
thronging
thoughts
back
to
the
world
to
wait
how
heaven
may
yet
dispose
my
lot
till
the
grave
close
upon
my
pilgrimage
yet
would
i
stay
a
while
to
bid
farewell
to
that
my
cave
where
i
have
seen
strange
things
and
heard
strange
voices
and
have
passed
five
years
in
loneliness
and
watching
and
in
prayer
let
me
not
part
till
i
have
said
farewell
hereafter
i
shall
tell
what
i
have
seen
but
now
o
lord
and
saviour
strengthen
me
a
poor
old
man
returning
to
the
world
oh
look
and
let
me
feel
thy
presence
now
whom
i
have
served
so
long
i
shall
not
see
again
thy
glorious
form
upon
the
earth
but
i
have
lived
to
see
thy
church
arise
now
in
its
infancy
and
gathering
power
from
day
to
day
and
thou
shalt
be
adored
till
the
remotest
isles
and
every
land
shall
praise
and
magnify
thy
glorious
name
my
days
are
told
and
few
remain
but
i
shall
live
protected
to
record
o
lord
and
saviour
all
which
i
have
seen
high
and
mysterious
as
i
declared
in
the
beginning
was
the
word
the
word
in
the
beginning
was
with
god
the
word
was
god
and
now
farewell
oh
may
i
pass
what
yet
remains
of
life
in
faith
and
hope
till
christ
shall
call
me
in
his
mercy
hence
and
lead
me
gently
to
my
last
repose
then
may
his
church
which
he
has
raised
on
earth
stand
though
the
tempest
shake
its
battlements
stand
till
the
trumpet
the
last
trumpet
sound
and
he
shall
come
in
clouds
who
founded
it
as
thus
he
spoke
his
stature
seemed
to
grow
more
lofty
with
a
step
more
firm
he
trod
whilst
a
mild
radiance
lambent
on
his
face
shone
as
the
radiance
from
the
he
held
his
way
oft
looking
back
to
mark
the
cave
where
he
had
lived
when
lo
the
dove
so
often
fed
from
his
pale
hand
has
left
the
cliff
and
flies
round
his
hair
and
now
he
turns
his
eyes
upon
the
deep
yet
scarce
had
reached
the
margin
when
he
saw
the
sullen
dwellers
on
these
rugged
shores
led
on
by
him
who
had
confessed
his
sins
the
robber
of
mount
carmel
in
his
chains
kneel
at
his
feet
they
blessed
him
sorrowing
that
they
should
see
his
face
on
earth
no
more
the
stern
centurion
hid
a
starting
tear
the
poor
emaciate
youth
knelt
down
and
she
who
tended
him
with
love
and
tenderness
wept
as
he
faintly
sank
and
breathed
his
last
his
hands
extending
feebly
as
he
sunk
to
john
in
fervent
prayer
the
grecian
girl
fell
desolate
and
sobbing
on
his
breast
but
lo
the
wind
has
veered
and
streaming
out
the
red
cross
pennant
points
to
asia
as
speed
ye
mariners
the
sails
are
swelling
and
the
widening
deep
is
all
before
you
surging
to
the
gale
so
they
kept
on
their
course
to
ephesus
and
the
√¶gean
waves
beheld
far
off
the
cave
the
lonely
sands
and
lessening
capes
of
dreary
patmos
sink
to
rise
no
more
apocalyptic
horses
white
horse
red
horse
black
horse
pale
horse
black
the
period
of
the
black
horse
and
rider
with
the
balance
is
generally
referred
to
the
reign
of
severus
but
here
the
commentators
are
at
a
loss
the
balance
sometimes
betokens
justice
sometimes
is
considered
as
indicative
of
a
season
of
scarcity
the
black
horse
is
always
associated
with
calamity
i
humbly
differ
from
all
commentators
the
horse
is
black
say
some
to
show
the
severity
of
the
nature
of
this
emperor
but
his
nature
was
generally
the
reverse
of
severity
now
i
shall
give
reasons
for
considering
that
the
balance
is
the
balance
of
justice
and
the
bread
for
a
penny
and
oil
and
wine
indicative
of
plenty
not
scarcity
of
plenty
owing
entirely
to
the
prudent
provisions
of
this
emperor
and
in
proof
of
this
as
well
as
what
i
shall
say
further
on
the
subject
i
adduce
not
the
testimony
of
professed
christian
commentators
but
the
testimony
the
stronger
for
that
reason
of
one
of
the
most
astute
adversaries
of
christianity
gibbon
now
christian
reader
mark
his
corroboration
of
the
veracity
of
this
prophecy
as
applied
to
severus
balances
in
his
hand
what
says
gibbon
salutary
laws
were
executed
with
inflexible
firmness
in
the
administration
of
justice
the
judgments
of
the
emperor
were
characterised
by
attention
discernment
and
impartiality
and
whenever
he
deviated
from
the
strict
line
of
equity
it
was
generally
in
favour
of
the
poor
and
a
measure
of
wheat
for
a
penny
and
three
measures
of
barley
for
a
penny
and
see
thou
hurt
not
the
oil
and
the
wine
he
left
in
the
public
granaries
a
provision
of
corn
for
seven
years
at
the
rate
of
quarters
a
day
but
the
black
horse
does
this
colour
seem
suitable
to
a
period
of
general
equity
and
justice
how
simple
is
one
explanation
at
least
so
it
appears
to
me
the
first
i
believe
who
ever
remarked
the
circumstance
and
how
minutely
does
the
singular
fact
tend
to
attest
the
awful
truth
of
the
prophecy
severus
was
an
african
and
the
horse
is
black
not
as
indicative
of
calamity
but
of
the
country
of
which
severus
was
a
native
the
prophecy
connected
with
the
horses
seems
as
regular
as
possible
beginning
from
the
times
of
the
apostle
the
white
horse
and
rider
is
universally
considered
as
emblematic
of
the
gospel
going
forth
conquering
and
to
conquer
the
red
horse
is
the
horse
of
blood
under
trajan
who
literally
took
peace
from
all
the
earth
the
pale
horse
designates
the
famine
and
dreadful
pestilence
under
gallienus
i
have
shown
not
from
the
writers
in
favour
of
christianity
but
from
the
attestation
of
the
most
astute
and
insidious
writer
against
it
the
regular
succession
and
wonderful
accordance
in
the
several
successive
periods
of
the
fact
and
the
prophetic
adumbrations
under
gallienus
how
remarkable
are
these
words
as
applicable
to
the
pale
horse
and
pestilence
in
the
third
century
commencing
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
years
after
the
death
of
john
famine
is
almost
always
followed
by
epidemical
diseases
other
causes
however
must
have
contributed
to
the
furious
plague
which
from
the
year
to
the
year
raged
without
interruption
in
every
province
every
city
and
almost
every
family
of
the
roman
empire
five
thousand
died
daily
in
rome
and
we
might
suspect
that
war
pestilence
and
famine
had
in
a
few
years
consumed
the
moiety
of
the
human
the
red
take
peace
from
all
the
earth
conquests
every
day
the
astonished
senate
received
intelligence
of
new
names
and
new
nations
that
acknowledged
his
sway
the
kings
of
bosphorus
colchis
albania
the
tribes
of
the
median
and
carducian
hills
had
implored
his
protection
armenia
mesopotamia
and
assyria
were
reduced
to
for
the
elucidations
of
this
last
book
i
have
referred
generally
to
commentators
chiefly
bishop
newton
though
the
reader
may
sometimes
be
disposed
to
smile
rather
than
acquiesce
but
i
can
not
omit
my
own
views
of
some
particular
passages
one
head
of
the
beast
wounded
but
not
to
death
is
most
singularly
descriptive
of
the
roman
empire
restored
to
strength
and
power
under
claudius
the
second
and
aurelius
and
the
beast
which
i
saw
was
like
unto
a
leopard
and
his
feet
were
as
the
feet
of
a
bear
and
his
mouth
as
the
mouth
of
a
lion
how
unexpectedly
do
they
tally
with
what
gibbon
says
of
the
roman
empire
at
the
time
consisting
of
the
tyrants
lions
soldiers
scattered
through
the
vast
and
various
provinces
and
barbarians
goths
indicated
by
the
bear
i
may
observe
further
that
the
locusts
and
crawling
things
like
scorpions
issuing
out
of
the
smoke
are
first
locusts
the
innumerable
northern
armies
secondly
crawling
things
like
scorpions
the
loathsome
vileness
attributed
to
nature
by
the
succession
of
gnostic
sects
depraving
the
beautiful
code
of
christianity
and
all
agreeing
in
one
doctrine
derived
from
the
chaldean
philosophers

genius
of

heart
hadst
thou
a
child
unequal
strife
the
scene
of
death
is
mother
and
child
lie
side
by
side
in
gore
when
evening
comes
through
the
lone
cottage
pane
no
light
looks
cheerful
in
the
darkening
plain
no
soothing
sounds
stray
the
dim
hills
along
no
trills
the
song
at
intervals
wild
accents
of
despair
or
shouts
are
heard
or
dismal
nightfires
glare
but
all
is
dark
and
silent
near
yon
heap
where
the
fallen
heroes
of
the
hamlet
sleep
save
that
at
times
a
hollow
groan
is
heard
or
melancholy
cry
of
the
save
where
some
dog
amid
the
scene
of
death
moans
as
he
watches
yet
his
master
breath
whilst
with
despair
and
love
that
seems
to
speak
he
licks
the
blood
that
stagnates
on
his
cheek
the
morn
looks
through
the
hurrying
clouds
the
air
sighs
as
it
lifts
at
times
the
dead
man
hair
upon
those
slaughtered
heaps
the
cold
stars
shine
and
freedom
sighs
the
triumph
gaul
is
thine
now
dawns
the
morn
vales
with
blood
defiled
where
late
affection
sweetest
pictures
smiled
the
still
lake
how
sadly
peals
the
bell
that
sounds
of
every
earthly
hope
the
knell
pale
on
the
crimsoned
snow
without
a
home
the
sad
survivors
of
that
roam
their
infants
outcast
on
the
desert
plain
demand
their
mothers
and
their
sires
in
vain
and
when
the
red
sun
leaves
the
darkening
sky
amid
those
gory
tracks
sit
down
and
sigh
shores
of
lucerne
where
many
a
winding
bay
shone
beauteous
to
the
morn
returning
ray
where
rosy
tints
upon
the
blue
lake
shone
and
touched
the
rock
with
colours
not
their
own
who
now
with
eyes
that
swim
in
tenderness
those
scenes
to
every
virtue
dear
shall
bless
what
pleasure
now
can
the
rich
landscape
yield
the
sparkling
cataract
the
pendent
field
hoar
declivities
the
sunny
tower
peering
beeches
that
its
roof
embower
and
cottage
tops
with
light
smoke
trailing
slow
the
gray
vapours
looming
far
below
who
shall
ascend
proud
pilate
height
and
mark
the
motley
clouds
sail
the
champagne
dark
now
breaking
in
fantastic
forms
and
now
dappling
the
distant
promontory
brow
then
when
the
sun
that
lights
the
scene
rides
high
and
far
away
the
scattered
volumes
fly
look
up
to
the
great
god
that
rules
the
world
by
whom
proud
empires
from
their
seats
are
hurled
and
feel
a
glow
of
holy
gratitude
that
here
hollow
glens
and
mountains
rude
far
from
ambition
march
and
discord
yell
content
with
love
and
happiness
should
dwell
who
now
along
those
banks
shall
listening
stray
when
evening
lights
each
inlet
west
away
and
hear
the
solitary
boatman
oar
dip
duly
as
he
nears
the
shaded
shore
or
catch
the
whispers
of
the
waterfall
that
through
the
ivied
clefts
swell
musical
these
scenes
these
sounds
could
many
a
joy
impart
with
sadness
mixed
the
wandering
youth
whose
heart
was
sick
with
many
sorrows
resting
here
at
such
an
hour
forgot
his
starting
tear
he
felt
a
pensive
calm
sweeter
than
sleep
steal
gently
his
aching
breast
the
deep
and
clear
repose
of
the
unruffled
lake
his
spirit
seemed
unconscious
to
partake
and
still
the
water
as
it
whispered
near
or
high
woods
as
they
rustled
soothed
his
ear
like
the
remembrance
of
a
melody
heard
in
his
infant
happy
years
gone
by
now
in
his
distant
country
when
with
tears
the
tale
of
ruffian
violence
he
hears
hears
that
the
spot
which
smiled
with
lovely
gleam
like
some
sweet
image
of
a
tender
dream
upon
his
morning
path
is
drenched
with
gore
its
harmless
tenants
weltering
on
the
shore
he
will
exclaim
whilst
from
his
breast
he
draws
a
deep
deep
sigh
avenge
o
god
their
cause
who
would
not
sigh
for
switzerland
what
heart
that
ever
bore
in
human
woes
a
part
that
ever
felt
affection
genuine
flame
that
ever
leaped
at
injured
freedom
name
would
not
for
her
dark
foes
feel
honest
hate
and
swell
with
indignation
at
her
fate
if
thus
her
lot
of
sorrow
have
impressed
grief
and
resentment
on
a
stranger
breast
how
must
he
hear
the
cruel
tale
of
death
he
who
in
these
sad
vales
first
drew
his
breath
is
his
perhaps
in
distant
climes
to
roam
far
from
the
shelter
of
his
early
home
yet
still
as
fancy
paints
the
spot
he
sees
his
father
cottage
and
the
mountain
trees
again
by
the
wild
streams
he
seems
to
rove
he
hears
the
voice
of
her
who
won
his
love
his
heart
first
love
for
her
he
prunes
the
vine
whose
clustering
leaves
the
rustic
porch
entwine
the
mountain
van
together
they
ascend
they
see
alps
piled
on
alps
far
on
extend
they
mark
the
casual
sunshine
light
the
mass
or
vernal
showers
along
the
valley
pass
whilst
tinging
the
dark
rocks
more
lovely
glow
the
braided
colours
of
heaven
humid
bow
but
now
the
maid
he
loved
with
whom
all
day
he
used
in
summer
the
hills
to
stray
the
faithful
maid
he
loved
oh
cold
despair
freeze
his
warm
and
that
thrilling
air
which
erst
he
sang
when
all
alive
to
joy
he
carolled
on
the
alps
a
shepherd
boy
let
him
not
hear
it
now
lest
tears
quick
start
and
madness
harrow
up
his
broken
heart
how
touching
was
the
simple
strain
the
tear
of
memory
started
when
it
met
the
ear
and
he
whose
front
was
rough
with
many
a
scar
whose
bold
heart
bounded
at
the
trump
of
war
stood
all
dissolved
in
sadness
at
its
tone
remembering
him
of
pleasant
seasons
gone
perhaps
full
many
a
heavy
hour
had
passed
since
in
its
native
nooks
he
heard
it
last
and
when
again
its
music
thrilled
a
thousand
thronging
recollections
filled
his
soul
that
sick
with
longing
homeward
roved
remote
from
scenes
which
most
on
earth
he
loved
cast
on
a
world
tempestuous
bleak
and
wide
more
ardent
for
his
hills
he
sighed
and
sighed
again
to
think
how
it
might
fare
with
sisters
brothers
friends
and
parents
there
for
be
its
music
and
its
name
forgot
the
desert
is
his
home
and
those
he
loved
are
not
part
second
i
was
a
child
of
sorrow
when
i
passed
sweet
country
through
your
rocky
valleys
last
for
one
whom
i
had
loved
whom
i
had
pressed
with
honest
ardent
passion
to
my
breast
was
to
another
vowed
i
heard
the
tale
and
to
the
earth
sank
heartless
faint
and
pale
till
that
sad
hour
when
every
hope
had
flown
i
thought
she
lived
for
me
and
me
alone
yet
did
i
not
though
pangs
my
heart
must
rend
prove
to
thy
weakness
a
sustaining
friend
did
i
not
bid
thee
never
never
more
or
think
of
me
or
mine
as
firm
i
swore
to
cast
away
the
dream
and
bury
deep
as
in
oblivion
of
the
dead
man
sleep
all
that
once
soothed
and
from
the
soul
to
tear
each
longing
wish
that
youth
had
cherished
there
but
when
was
midnight
to
the
woods
i
hied
despairing
and
with
frantic
anguish
cried
oh
had
relentless
death
with
instant
dart
smitten
and
snatched
thee
from
my
bleeding
heart
through
life
had
niggard
fortune
bid
us
pine
and
withered
with
despair
thy
hopes
and
mine
yes
yes
i
could
have
borne
it
but
to
see
the
accusing
tear
and
know
it
falls
for
me
oh
cease
the
thought
a
long
and
last
farewell
we
must
forget
nor
shall
my
soul
rebel
then
to
my
country
cliffs
i
bade
adieu
and
what
my
sad
heart
felt
god
only
knew
helvetia
thy
rude
scenes
a
drooping
guest
i
sought
and
sorrowing
sought
a
spot
of
rest
through
many
a
mountain
pass
and
shaggy
vale
i
roamed
an
exile
and
pale
i
saw
your
clouded
heights
sublime
impend
i
heard
your
foaming
cataracts
descend
and
oft
the
rugged
scene
my
heart
endued
with
a
strange
sad
distempered
fortitude
oft
on
the
lake
green
marge
i
lay
reclined
murmuring
my
moody
fancies
to
the
wind
but
when
some
hanging
hamlet
i
surveyed
a
peeping
in
the
sheltered
glade
a
tear
perforce
would
steal
and
as
my
eye
fondly
reverted
to
the
days
gone
by
how
blest
i
cried
remote
from
every
care
to
rest
with
her
we
loved
forgotten
there
then
soft
methought
from
the
sequestered
grove
i
heard
the
song
of
happiness
and
love
come
to
these
scenes
of
peace
where
to
rivers
murmuring
the
sweet
birds
all
the
summer
sing
where
cares
and
toil
and
sadness
cease
stranger
does
thy
heart
deplore
friends
whom
thou
wilt
see
no
more
does
thy
wounded
spirit
prove
pangs
of
hopeless
severed
love
thee
the
stream
that
gushes
clear
thee
the
birds
that
carol
near
shall
soothe
as
silent
thou
dost
lie
and
dream
of
their
wild
lullaby
come
to
bless
these
scenes
of
peace
where
cares
and
toil
and
sadness
cease
start
from
the
feeble
dream
the
woodland
shed
flames
and
the
tenants
of
that
vale
are
dead
all
dark
the
torrent
of
their
fate
hath
rushed
each
cheering
echo
of
the
plain
is
hushed
and
every
joyous
every
tender
sound
in
the
loud
roaring
of
the
drowned
how
cheerily
the
rocks
from
side
to
side
oft
to
the
tabor
festive
sounds
replied
there
when
the
bells
upon
a
holiday
rang
out
and
all
the
villagers
were
gay
in
the
happy
groups
were
seen
youth
linked
with
beauty
bounded
on
the
green
and
age
sat
smiling
as
the
joyous
train
round
the
tall
tapering
from
the
plain
their
locks
entwined
with
ribands
streaming
red
and
crowned
with
flowers
the
rural
pastimes
led
oh
on
the
bleeding
turf
the
sad
flowers
throw
and
weep
for
them
that
sleep
in
dust
below
there
sleep
together
in
their
deathbed
cold
the
beautiful
the
brave
the
young
the
old
no
voice
is
heard
that
charmed
their
earthly
road
around
their
desolate
and
last
abode
the
blast
that
swept
them
to
the
earth
yet
raves
and
strews
with
havoc
their
insulted
graves
as
on
the
lucid
lake
unruffled
breast
soft
silvery
lights
and
blending
shadows
rest
above
around
the
heavens
blue
calm
is
spread
and
sleeps
the
sunshine
on
the
mountain
head
then
purple
rocks
and
woods
smile
to
the
eye
like
fairy
landscapes
of
the
evening
sky
and
all
is
sad
save
where
some
forest
bird
with
small
and
solitary
trill
is
heard
sudden
the
scene
is
changed
the
hurricane
is
up
among
the
mountains
wind
and
rain
drive
and
strange
darkness
closes
on
the
vale
and
high
rocks
to
the
lightning
glimmer
pale
and
nought
is
heard
but
the
deep
thunder
roar
or
vultures
screaming
round
the
desert
shore
so
mourns
the
prospect
changed
and
overcast
and
shrieks
the
spirit
in
the
passing
blast
but
ah
how
feller
burst
the
ruthless
storm
that
speeds
the
moral
prospect
to
deform
and
the
man
of
blood
may
see
again
fresh
verdure
deck
the
dripping
tree
again
pure
splendour
light
yon
bursting
views
and
the
clear
lake
reflect
the
fairest
hues
whilst
the
gay
lark
seems
with
a
livelier
voice
in
scorn
of
his
stern
spirit
to
rejoice
but
hapless
land
what
dayspring
shall
restore
the
lovelier
morals
that
now
smile
no
more
affection
tender
as
the
murmuring
dove
that
in
the
noiseless
wood
her
wove
and
piety
that
the
blue
mountains
trod
with
kindling
eyes
upraised
to
nature
god
virtues
that
made
thy
streams
and
woods
and
hills
thy
lakes
all
sunshine
and
thy
shaded
rills
like
pictures
of
no
earthly
paradise
beaming
remote
from
sorrow
and
from
vice
far
from
the
earthly
scenes
that
wasteful
lie
virtue
and
peace
and
arts
and
freedom
fly
arts
which
the
wild
surrounding
views
inspired
and
freedom
such
as
genuine
patriots
fired
when
the
great
sun
sinks
in
the
crimson
west
and
all
the
pines
in
golden
pomp
are
dressed
whose
daring
hand
shall
snatch
the
vivid
light
that
purples
the
promontory
height
and
with
a
loutherbourg
rich
pencil
throw
on
the
warm
tablet
all
the
lucid
glow
when
the
slow
convent
bell
sounds
from
afar
and
the
dim
lake
reflects
the
evening
star
when
shall
again
the
rapt
enthusiast
rove
and
deck
the
visionary
bower
of
love
hushed
be
the
doric
strain
that
in
the
shade
of
his
own
pines
the
pensive
gesner
played
which
oft
the
woodman
near
paused
with
his
gray
beard
on
his
staff
to
hear
whilst
his
lean
dog
whose
opening
lips
disclose
just
peeping
forth
his
white
teeth
even
rows
lifted
his
long
ears
with
sagacious
heed
and
fixed
his
full
eye
on
his
trilling
reed
high
on
the
broad
alps
solitary
van
where
not
a
sound
is
heard
of
busy
man
hark
with
loud
orgies
the
bloody
dew
lewd
comus
leads
his
nightly
madding
crew
strong
shouts
and
clangours
through
the
high
wood
run
and
distant
arms
flash
to
the
sinking
sun
dark
forests
their
lone
empire
the
tall
rocks
their
shelter
and
their
wealth
their
wandering
flocks
to
the
proud
macedon
whose
conquering
car
rolled
terrible
through
the
ranks
of
armed
war
whose
banners
chilled
the
plain
with
fearful
shade
whose
sovereignty
a
thousand
trumpets
brayed
the
scythian
chiefs
spoke
nobly
what
have
we
king
of
the
world
to
do
with
thine
or
thee
far
the
snowy
solitudes
we
roam
or
by
wild
rivers
fix
our
casual
home
the
green
champagne
let
thy
cities
shine
we
invaded
fields
or
seats
of
thine
nor
will
we
bow
proud
lord
at
thy
decree
hence
hence
and
leave
us
to
our
forests
free
but
the
stern
soldier
with
war
banners
spread
through
thy
still
vales
his
glittering
squadrons
led
and
wild
despair
and
unrelenting
hate
stalk
thine
inmost
valleys
desolate
and
she
that
like
the
nimble
mountain
roe
with
step
scarce
heard
went
bounding
the
snow
she
whose
green
buskins
swept
the
frosts
of
morn
who
walked
the
high
wood
with
her
bugle
horn
she
who
once
called
these
hills
her
own
and
found
her
loveliest
sojourn
the
hallowed
ground
blessing
the
spot
where
shaded
with
high
wood
and
decked
with
simple
flowers
her
altar
stood
freedom
insulted
sees
as
pale
she
flies
a
monster
phantom
in
her
name
arise
on
weltering
carcases
it
seems
to
stand
waving
a
dagger
in
its
hand
its
look
is
unrelenting
as
the
grave
around
its
brow
the
muttering
whirlwinds
rave
its
spreading
shadow
chills
the
scene
beneath
ah
fly
it
onward
moves
and
murmurs
death
earth
fades
beneath
its
footstep
and
around
long
sighs
and
distant
dying
shrieks
resound
could
arms
alone
thy
brave
sons
prevail
helvetia
no
it
was
the
fraudful
tale
of
this
false
phantom
which
the
heart
misled

peace

dark
in

hideous
phantom

the
villager
preface
the
following
compositions
were
written
originally
to
be
learned
by
heart
by
poor
children
of
my
own
parish
who
have
been
instructed
every
sunday
through
the
summer
on
the
garden
lawn
before
the
parsonage
house
by
mrs
bowles
the
object
which
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
is
entirely
novel
was
briefly
to
describe
the
most
obvious
images
in
country
life
familiar
to
every
child
and
in
the
smallest
compass
to
connect
every
distinct
picture
with
the
earliest
feelings
of
humanity
and
piety
in
language
which
the
simplest
might
understand
but
which
from
the
objects
represented
might
be
read
perhaps
with
some
interest
by
those
whose
minds
were
more
cultivated
about
fourteen
of
these
little
poems
were
composed
with
this
view
many
years
ago
but
it
was
not
thought
of
extending
their
knowledge
beyond
the
village
circle
to
which
they
were
originally
limited
except
by
a
very
few
copies
given
away
i
have
now
added
to
the
number
and
revised
the
whole
thinking
that
when
early
education
is
so
greatly
extended
they
may
be
found
upon
a
wider
scale
to
answer
the
purpose
for
which
they
were
written
they
may
also
prove
acceptable
to
mothers
in
a
higher
station
of
life
who
might
wish
to
impress
upon
the
memory
of
their
children
as
they
grow
up
a
love
of
natural
scenes
combined
with
the
earliest
feelings
of
sympathy
and
religion
some
of
these
verses
such
as
the
mower
the
swan
are
purposely
designed
for
the
exercise
of
a
more
advanced
intellect
the
villager
path
of
life
o
lord
in
sickness
and
in
health
to
every
lot
resigned
grant
me
before
all
worldly
wealth
a
meek
and
thankful
mind
as
life
thy
upland
path
we
tread
and
often
pause
in
vain
to
think
of
friends
and
parents
dead
oh
let
us
not
complain
the
lord
may
give
or
take
away
but
nought
our
faith
can
move
whilst
we
to
heaven
can
look
and
say
our
father
lives
above
sunrise
when
from
my
humble
bed
i
rise
and
see
the
morning
sun
that
glorious
in
the
eastern
skies
its
journey
has
begun
i
think
of
the
almighty
power
which
called
this
orb
from
night
i
think
how
many
at
this
hour
rejoice
beneath
its
light
and
then
i
pray
in
every
land
this
light
is
shed
that
all
who
live
may
bless
the
hand
which
gives
their
daily
bread

homeward

brothers

my
sisters

the

when
my
hastening
steps
they
hear
and
smile
to
welcome
me
but
when
the
fire
is
growing
dim
and
mother
labours
cease
i
fold
my
hands
repeat
my
hymn
and
lay
me
down

i
though
a

in

i
rejoice

the

now
a

in

or
bleats
beside
its

how
anxiously
the
mother
tries
with
every
tender
care
to
screen
it
from
inclement
skies
and
the
cold

the

with

ever
as

i
hear

ascends

morning
the

bells
are
knolling
slow
the
summer
morn
how
fair
whilst
father
mother
children
go
and
seek
the
house
of
prayer
some
musing
roam
the
churchyard
round
some
turn
their
heads
with
sighs
and
gaze
upon
the
ground
where
old
giles
summers
lies
but
see
the
pastor
in
his
band
the
bells
have
ceased
to
knoll
now
enter
and
at
god
command
think
christian
of
thy
soul
whilst
heavenly
hopes
around
thee
shine
as
in
god
presence
live
and
calmer
comforts
shall
be
thine
than
all
the
world
can
give
the
primrose
is
the
first
primrose
see
how
meek
yet
beautiful
it
looks
as
just
a
lesson
it
may
teach
as
that
we
read
in
books
while
gardens
show
in
flowering
pride
the
lily
stately
ranks
it
loves
its
modest
head
to
hide
beneath
the
bramble
banks
and
so
the
little
cottage
maid
may
bloom
unseen
and
die
but
she
when
transient
flowerets
fade
shall
live
with
christ
on
high
the
as
by
my
mother
side
i
stand
whose
hairs
alas
are
few
and
gray
i
watch
the
shed
its
sand
to
mark
how
wears
the
night
away
though
age
must
many
ills
endure
as
time
for
ever
runs
away
this
shows
her
christian
comforts
sure
and
leads
to
heaven
eternal
day
the
bird
nest
in
yonder
brake
there
is
a
nest
but
come
not
george
too
nigh
lest
the
poor
mother
frightened
thence
should
leave
her
young
and
fly
think
with
what
pain
for
many
a
day
soft
moss
and
straw
she
brought
and
let
our
own
dear
mother
care
be
present
to
our
thought
and
think
how
must
her
heart
deplore
and
droop
with
grief
and
pain
if
those
she
reared
and
nursed
and
loved
she
should
see
again
the
mower
hark
to
the
mower
whistling
blade
how
steadily
he
mows
the
grass
is
heaped
the
daisies
fade
all
scattered
as
he
goes
the
flowers
of
life
may
bloom
and
fade
but
he
in
whom
i
trust
though
cold
and
in
my
laid
can
raise
me
from
the
dust
saturday
night
come
let
us
ere
we
go
to
bed
the
decaying
embers
chat
though
little
mary
hangs
her
head
and
strokes
no
more
the
purring
cat
and
let
us
tell
how
prisoners
pine
in
silent
dungeons
dark
and
drear
whilst
on
each
face
the
embers
shine
and
all
is
calm
and
peaceful
here
the
english
cot
is
free
from
cares
but
see
the
brand
is
wasted
quite
come
little
mary
say
your
prayers
kiss
mother
kiss
good
night
good
night
sunday
night
let
us
unfold
god
holy
book
and
by
the
taper
light
with
hearts
subdued
and
sober
look
so
spend
the
sabbath
night
where
now
the
thoughts
of
anxious
life
its
guilty
pleasures
where
here
dies
its
loud
and
mourning
strife
and
all
its
sounds
of
care
let
other
views
our
hearts
engross
to
our
redeemer
true
who
seems
expiring
on
the
cross
to
say
i
died
for
you
the
april
shower
when
glistening
from
the
thatch
like
drops
of
silver
run
our
old
blind
grandame
lifts
the
latch
to
feel
the
cheering
sun
she
sees
no
rainbow
in
the
sky
but
when
the
cuckoo
sung
she
thought
upon
the
years
gone
by
when
she
was
blithe
and
young
but
god
who
comforts
want
and
age
shall
be
her
only
friend
and
bless
her
till
her
pilgrimage
in
silent
dust
shall
end
the
robin
redbreast
poor
robin
sits
and
sings
alone
when
showers
of
driving
sleet
by
the
cold
winds
of
winter
blown
the
cottage
casement
beat
come
let
him
share
our
chimney
nook
and
dry
his
dripping
wing
see
little
mary
shuts
her
book
and
cries
poor
robin
sing
methinks
i
hear
his
faint
reply
when
cowslips
deck
the
plain
the
lark
shall
carol
in
the
sky
and
i
shall
sing
again
but
in
the
cold
and
wintry
day
to
you
i
owe
a
debt
that
in
the
sunshine
of
the
may
i
never
can
forget
the
butterfly
and
the
bee
methought
i
heard
a
butterfly
say
to
a
labouring
bee
thou
hast
no
colours
of
the
sky
on
painted
wings
like
me
poor
child
of
vanity
those
dyes
and
colours
bright
and
rare
with
mild
reproof
the
bee
replies
are
all
beneath
my
care
content
i
toil
from
morn
till
eve
and
scorning
idleness
to
tribes
of
gawdy
sloth
i
leave
the
vanities
of
dress
the
oh
what
is
this
which
shines
so
bright
and
in
the
lonely
place
hangs
out
his
small
green
lamp
at
night
the
dewy
bank
to
grace
it
is
a
still
and
pale
it
shines
the
whole
night
long
when
only
stars
o
nightingale
seem
listening
to
thy
song
and
so
amid
the
world
cold
night
through
good
report
or
ill
shines
out
the
humble
christian
light
as
lonely
and
as
still
the
convict
luke
andrews
is
transported
never
more
to
see
his
sisters
mother
or
the
shore
of
his
own
country
never
more
to
see
the
cottage
smoke
rise
the
sheltering
tree
never
again
beneath
the
morning
beam
jocund
to
drive
afield
his
tinkling
team
when
first
the
path
of
idleness
he
trod
and
left
on
the
house
of
god
the
fellowship
of
wild
companions
kept
how
oft
at
night
his
mother
waked
and
wept
when
he
is
homeless
and
far
off
at
sea
she
now
will
sigh
does
he
remember
me
remember
her
alas
the
thought
is
vain
she
will
see
him
in
this
world
again
and
she
is
but
her
trust
is
still
in
him
whose
works
and
ways
are
just
oh
may
we
still
revere
his
dread
command
and
die
remembered
in
our
native
land
the
blind
grandfather
though
grandfather
has
long
been
blind
and
his
few
locks
are
gray
he
loves
to
hear
the
summer
wind
round
his
pale
temples
play
we
lead
him
to
some
quiet
place
some
unfrequented
nook
where
winds
breathe
soft
and
grace
the
borders
of
the
brook
there
he
shall
sit
as
in
a
dream
though
nought
can
he
behold
till
the
brook
murmuring
flow
shall
seem
the
voice
of
friends
of
old
think
no
more
of
them
aged
man
for
here
thou
hast
no
friend
think
since
this
life
is
but
a
span
of
joys
that
have
no
end
the
old

are
you
not
tired
you
poor
old
man
the
drops
are
on
your
brow
your
labour
with
the
sun
began
and
you
are
labouring
now
i
murmur
not
to
dig
the
soil
for
i
have
heard
it
read
that
man
by
industry
and
toil
must
eat
his
daily
bread
the
lark
awakes
me
with
his
song
that
hails
the
morning
gray
and
when
i
mourn
for
human
wrong
i
think
of
god
and
pray
let
worldlings
waste
their
time
and
health
and
try
each
vain
delight
they
can
not
buy
with
all
their
wealth

look
at
the

how
still
he
goes
his
neck
and
breast
like
silver
gleam
he
seems
majestic
as
he
rows
the
glory
of
the
lonely
stream
there
is
a
glory
in
the
war
a
glory
when
the
warrior
wears
his
visage
marked
with
many
a
scar
the
laurel
wet
with
human
tears
such
scenes
no
glory
can
impart
with
trumps
and

and
noises

that
which
fills
his
silent
heart
who
walks

the

who
does
not
love
the

their
cheerful

should
all
the
winter

from
the
window
to
be
heard
repay
thee
with
a
song
a
lesson
let
it
still
convey
to
all
with
sense
endued

such
the
voice
oh
let
it
say
the
still
small
voice
of
love
the
shepherd

his
dog
my
dog

i
are
both
grown
old
on
these
wild
downs
we
watch
all

he
looks

thus
methinks
i
hear
him
say
the
gray
stone
circlet

is
at

we
nothing
hear

the

crow

an

swallows
at
the
close
of

when
autumn
shone
with
fainter
ray
around
the
chimney
circling
flew
ere
yet
they
bade
a
long
adieu
to
climes
where
soon
the
winter
drear
shall
close
the
unrejoicing
year
now
with
swift
wing
they
skim
aloof
now
settle
on
the
crowded
roof
as
counsel
and
advice
to
take
ere
they
the
chilly
north
forsake
then
one
disdainful
turned
his
eye
upon
a
twittering
nigh
and
thus
began
with
taunting
scorn
thou
household
imp
obscure
forlorn
through
the
deep
winter
dreary
day
here
dull
and
shivering
shalt
thou
stay
whilst
we
who
make
the
world
our
home
to
softer
climes
impatient
roam
where
summer
still
on
some
green
isle
rests
with
her
sweet
and
lovely
smile
thus
speeding
far
and
far
away
we
leave
behind
the
shortening
day

true

answered
meek
no

i
ask
or
seek
to
every
change
alike
resigned
i
fear
not
the
cold
winter
wind
when
spring
returns
the
circling
year
shall
find
me
still
contented
here
but
whilst
my
warm
affections
rest
within
the
circle
of
my
nest
i
learn
to
pity
those
that
roam
and
love
the
more
my
humble
home
the
blind
man
of
salisbury
cathedral
there
is
a
poor
blind
man
who
every
day
in
summer
sunshine
or
in
winter
rain
duly
as
tolls
the
bell
to
the
high
fane
explores
with
faltering
footsteps
his
dark
way
to
kneel
before
his
maker
and
to
hear
the
chaunted
service
pealing
full
and
clear
ask
why
alone
in
the
same
spot
he
kneels
through
the
long
year
oh
the
wide
world
is
cold
as
dark
to
him
here
he
no
longer
feels
his
sad
bereavement
faith
and
hope
uphold
his
heart
he
feels
not
he
is
poor
and
blind
amid
the
unpitying
tumult
of
his
mind
as
through
the
aisles
the
choral
anthems
roll
his
soul
is
in
the
choirs
above
the
skies
and
songs
far
off
of
angel
companies
when
this
dim
earth
hath
perished
like
a
scroll
oh
happy
if

rich
the
vain
the
proud
the
plumed
actors
in

motley
crowd
since
pride
is
dust

itself

lonely
and

to
fortune
resigned
forgetting
the

thou
turnest
thy

unnoticed
and
blind
old
soldier
that
faded
red
jacket
still
speaks
of
some
pride

a
dutiful

is
seen
at
thy

to
beat
her

thy
footsteps
to

ah
woe
to

then
escaped
the

let
none
the

condemn

maid
of
tetuan
all
day
shall
sit
and
weep

never
see
her

sail
shine
on
the
northern
deep
there
many
a

with
her
babe
shall
pace
the
sounding
shore

its
father
smile
whom
she
shall
see
no

upon

thy
surges

in
this
wise
the
duke
of
gloucester
took
upon
himself
the
order
and
governance
of
the
young
king
whom
with
much
honour
and
humble
reverence
he
conveyed
towards
london
but
the
tidings
of
this
matter
came
hastily
to
the
queen
a
little
before
the
midnight
following
and
that
in
secret
wise
her
son
was
taken
her
brother
and
other
friends
arrested
and
sent
no
man
wist
whither
to
be
done
with
god
wot
what
with
which
tidings
the
queen
with
great
heaviness
bewailed
her
child
reign
her
friend
mischance
and
her
own
misfortune
damning
the
time
that
ever
she
dissuaded
the
gathering
of
powers
about
the
king
got
herself
in
all
haste
possible
with
her
young
son
and
her
daughter
out
of
the
palace
of
westminster
in
which
they
then
lay
into
the
sanctuary
lodging

and
company

scene
i
widow
of
edward
in
the
palace
of
westminster
watching
her
youngest
son
richard
eliz
the
tolls
midnight
i
have
watched
night
after
night
and
heard
the
same
sad
sound
knolling
the
same
sad
sound
night
after
night
as
if
amid
the
world
deep
silence
time
pausing
a
moment
in
his
onward
flight
from
yonder
solitary
moonlit
pile
more
awful
spoke
as
with
a
voice
from
heaven
of
days
and
hours
departed
and
of
those
that
are
not
till
like
dreams
of
yesterday
the
very
echo
dies
oh
my
poor
child
thou
hast
been
long
asleep
by
the
pale
lamp
i
sit
and
watch
thy
slumbers
thy
calm
lids
are
closed
thy
lips
just
parted
one
hand
lies
upon
thy
breast
that
scarce
is
seen
to
heave
beneath
it
and
thy
breath
so
still
is
drawn
save
to
a
sleepless
mother
listening
ear
it
were
inaudible
and
see
a
smile
seems
even
now
lighting
on
thy
lip
dear
boy
as
thou
wert
dreaming
of
delightful
things
in
some
celestial
region
of
sweet
sounds
or
summer
fields
and
skies
without
a
cloud
ah
how
unlike
this
dark
and
troubled
world
let
not
one
kiss
awaken
thee
one
kiss
mingled
with
tears
and
prayer
to
god
in
heaven
so
dream
and
never
never
may
those
eyes
awake
suffused
with
tears
as
mine
are
now
to
think
that
life
best
hopes
are
such
a
dream
now
sleeps
the
city
through
its
vast
extent
that
restless
as
the
at
morn
with
its
ten
thousand
voices
shall
awake
lifting
the
murmur
of
its
multitude
to
heaven
still
gate
now
all
is
hushed
as
death
none
are
awake
save
those
who
wake
to
weep
like
me
save
those
who
meditate
revenge
or
beckon
muttering
murder
god
of
heaven
from
the
hyena
panting
for
their
blood
oh
save
my
youthful
edward
and
poor
child
preserve
thy
innocence
to
happier
hours

there
is
knocking
at
the
western
gate

and
widowed
queens

in
the
shroud
of
death
along
the
glimmering
aisles
and
hollow
vaults

seemed
to
look
i
can
not
say
how
sadly
could
it
be
his
spirit
he
was
armed
but
very
pale
and
sorrowful
his
countenance
i
heard
no
sound
of
footsteps
when
he
moved
away
and
disappeared
among
the
distant
tombs
in
further
darkness
eliz
o
my
son
my
son
thou
hadst
a
king
thy
father
he
is
dead
thou
hadst
been
happier
as
a
peasant

i
wish
i
were
a
shepherd
boy
for
then
dear
mother
i
would
run
and
play
with
edward
and
we
two
in
would
wander
out
among
the
villages
or
go
by
some
river
side
and
mark
the
when
morning
shone
upon
the
yellow
gravel
shoot
away
beneath

old
gray
arch

cold
monument

moment
thou
dost
see

scene
iii
cardinal
of
eliz
now
my
lord
cardinal
what
is
the
will
of
our
great
lords
with
me
your
grace
well
knows
i
am
a
helpless
woman
have
no
power
my
only
wish
for
what
of
life
remains
prayer
and
repose
and
for
my
poor
child
here
safety
car
the
council
madam
wish
no
less
but
for
your
son
they
deem
his
durance
here
breeds
ill
report
this
separation
too
of
those
in
blood
allied
almost
of
years
the
same
who
have
been
cradled
in
one
lap
what
can
it
say
but
that
one
brother
stands
in
peril
of
the
other
and
besides
were
it
not
for
the
comfort
of
them
both
that
they
should
be
together
sport
not
care
becomes
their
early
years
eliz
i
say
not
nay
it
is
most
fitting
that
my
youngest
son
were
with
the
king
his
brother
in
good
faith
i
know
it
would
be
comfort
to
them
both
but
when
i
think
upon
the
tender
years
even
of
the
eldest
i
must
also
think
a
mother
custody
were
best
for
either
you
have
no
children
else
i
would
not
ask
is
there
a
guardian
like
a
mother
love
richard
look
up
this
good
man
here
intends
no
harm
to
me
or
you
look
up
my
boy
no
power
on
earth
nothing
but
death
itself
shall
sever
us
what
would
you
more
my
lord
car
madam
no
man
contendeth
that
your
grace
is
not
the
fittest
guardian
of
your
child
and
tenderest
but
if
so
it
pleases
you
here
to
lie
hid
shut
out
from
all
the
world
be
it
for
humour
or
for
jealousy
we
hold
it
meetest
that
no
power
on
earth
should
so
detain
a
brother
of
the
king
and
let
me
add
when
reasons
of
the
state
required
the
absence
of
your
eldest
son
yourself
were
well
content
eliz
not
very
well
nor
is
the
case
the
same
one
was
in
health
the
other
here
declines
and
let
me
marvel
that
the
lord
protector
of
this
realm
should
wish
him
out
for
should
aught
ill
betide
suspicion
in
some
tempers
might
arise
against
the
keeping
of
his
grace
my
lord
do
they
complain
that
my
child
richard
here
is
with
his
desolate
and
widowed
mother
who
has
no
other
comfort
do
they
claim
his
presence
for
that
here
his
residence
consorts
not
with
his
fortunes
i
am
fixed
not
to
come
forth
and
jeopardy
his
life
car
jeopardy
where
and
how
why
should
indeed
your
friends
have
any
fears
can
you
say
why
eliz
truly
nor
why
in
prison
they
should
be
as
now
they
are
i
know
no
reason
why
but
this
i
know
that
they
who
without
colour
have
cast
them
into
prison
if
they
will
their
deaths
may
compass
with
as
little
cause
my
lord
no
more
of
this
car
my
gracious
queen
this
only
let
me
say
if
by
arrest
your
grace
high
and
honourable
kin
be
now
confined
when
trial
has
been
had
they
shall
do
well
and
for
your
grace
self
there
never
was
nor
can
be
jeopardy
eliz
why
should
i
trust
that
i
am
innocent
and
were
they
guilty
that
i
am
more
loved
even
by
those
enemies
who
only
hate
them
for
my
sake
therefore
i
will
not
forth
nor
shall
my
son
here
will
we
both
abide
these
shrines
shall
be
the
world
to
him
and
me
these
monuments
our
sad
companions
or
when
as
now
the
morning
sunshine
streams
slant
from
the
window
height
and
rests
on
yonder
tomb
it
shall
discourse
to
me
of
the
brief
sunshine
in
the
gloom
of
life
no
of
heaven
light
upon
the
silent
grave
of
the
tired
traveller
eternal
home
of
hope
and
joy
beyond
this
vale
of
tears
car
then
pardon
me
we
will
not
bandy
words
further
if
it
shall
please
you
generous
queen
to
yield
your
son
i
pledge
my
life
and
soul
not
only
for
a
surety
but
estate
if
resolutely
still
you
answer
no
we
shall
forthwith
depart
for
nevermore
will
i
be
suitor
in
this
business
unto
your
majesty
who
thus
accuse
either
of
want
of
knowledge
or
of
truth
those
who
would
stake
their
lives
on
the
event
madam
farewell
eliz
a
stay
let
me
think
again
if
you
say
sooth
and
i
have
found
you
ever
my
lord
a
faithful
friend
and
counsellor
into
your
hands
i
here
resign
in
trust
my
dearest
treasure
upon
earth
my
son
of
you
i
will
require
him
before
heaven
yet
for
the
love
which
his
dead
father
bore
you
for
kindnesses
of
old
and
for
that
trust
the
king
my
husband
ever
placed
in
you
think
if
a
wretched
mother
fear
too
much
oh
think
and
be
you
wary
lest
you
fear
too
little
my
poor
child
here
then
we
part

on
your

knows
poor
babe
whether
in
this
world
we
shall
meet
again

me
dry
thy
tears
or
hide
them
in

with

rise
like
towering
smoke
it
answered
not
but
pointed
as
it
fled
to
the
black
carcase
of
the
sightless
dead
once
more
i
heard
the
sounds
of
earthly
strife
and
the
streets
ringing
to
the
stir
of
life
chantrey
sleeping
children
look
at
those
sleeping
children
softly
tread
lest
thou
do
mar
their
dream
and
come
not
nigh
till
their
fond
mother
with
a
kiss
shall
cry
is
morn
awake
awake
ah
they
are
dead
yet
folded
in
each
other
arms
they
lie
so
still
oh
look
so
still
and
smilingly
so
breathing
and
so
beautiful
they
seem
as
if
to
die
in
youth
were
but
to
dream
of
spring
and
flowers
of
flowers
yet
nearer
stand
there
is
a
lily
in
one
little
hand
broken
but
not
faded
yet
as
if
its
cup
with
tears
were
wet
so
sleeps
that
child
not
faded
though
in
death
and
seeming
still
to
hear
her
sister
breath
as
when
she
first
did
lay
her
head
to
rest
gently
on
that
sister
breast
and
kissed
her
ere
she
fell
asleep
the
archangel
trump
alone
shall
wake
that
slumber
deep
take
up
those
flowers
that
fell
from
the
dead
hand
and
sigh
a
long
farewell
your
spirits
rest
in
bliss
yet
ere
with
parting
prayers
we
say
farewell
for
ever
to
the
insensate
clay
poor
maid
those
pale
lips
we
will
kiss
ah
is
cold
marble
artist
who
hast
wrought
this
work
of
nature
feeling
and
of
thought
thine
chantrey
be
the
fame
that
joins
to
immortality
thy
name
for
these
sweet
children
that
so
sculptured
rest
a
sister
head
upon
a
sister
breast
age
after
age
shall
pass
away
nor
shall
their
beauty
fade
their
forms
decay
for
here
is
no
corruption
the
cold
worm
can
never
prey
upon
that
beauteous
form
this
smile
of
death
that
fades
not
shall
engage
the
deep
affections
of
each
distant
age
mothers
till
ruin
the
round
world
hath
rent
shall
gaze
with
tears
upon
the

and

sigh
with

how
sweetly
sleep
the
innocent
in
death
on

planting

yes
pamela
this

planted
in

earth
by
thee
shall
strike
its
root
and
pleasant
grow
whilst
i
am
mouldering
dust
below
this
churchyard
turf
shall
still
be
green
when
other
pastors
here
are
seen
who
gazing
on
that
dial
gray
shall
mourn
like
me
life
passing
ray
what
says
its
monitory
shade
thyself
so
blooming
now
shalt
fade
and
even
that
fair
and
lightsome
boy
elastic
as
the
step
of
joy
the
future
lord
of
yon
domain
and
all
this
wide
extended
plain
shall
yield
to
creeping
time
when
they
who
loved
him
shall
have
passed
away
yet
planted
by
his
youthful
hand
the
still
shall
stand
and
when
it
spreads
its
boughs
around
shading
the
consecrated
ground
he
may
behold
its
shade
and
say
himself
then
haply
growing
gray
yes
i
remember
aged
tree
when
i
was
young
who
planted
thee
but
long
may
time
blithe
maiden
spare
thy
beaming
eyes
and
crisped
hair
thy
unaffected
converse
kind
thy
gentle
and
ingenuous
mind
for
him
when
i
in
dust
repose
may
virtue
guide
him
as
he
grows
and
may
he
when
no
longer
young
resemble
those
from
whom
he
sprung
then
let
these
trees
extend
their
shade
or
live
or
die
or
bloom
or
fade
virtue
uninjured
and
sublime
shall
lift
her
brightest
wreath
untouched
by
time
the
greenwich
pensioners
when
evening
listened
to
the
dipping
oar
forgetting
the
loud
city
ceaseless
roar
by
the
green
banks
where
thames
with
conscious
pride
reflects
that
stately
structure
on
his
side
within
whose
walls
as
their
long
labours
close
the
wanderers
of
the
ocean
find
repose
we
wore
in
social
ease
the
hours
away
the
passing
visit
of
a
summer
day
whilst
some
to
range
the
breezy
hill
are
gone
i
lingered
on
the
river
marge
alone
mingled
with
groups
of
ancient
sailors
gray
and
watched
the
last
bright
sunshine
steal
away
as
thus
i
mused
amidst
the
various
train
of
wanderers
of
the
perilous
main
two
sailors
well
i
marked
them
as
the
beam
of
parting
day
yet
lingered
on
the
stream
and
the
sun
sank
behind
the
shady
reach
hastened
with
tottering
footsteps
to
the
beach
the
one
had
lost
a
limb
in
nile
dread
fight
total
eclipse
had
veiled
the
other
sight
for
ever
as
i
drew
more
anxious
near
i
stood
intent
if
they
should
speak
to
hear
but
neither
said
a
word
he
who
was
blind
stood
as
to
feel
the
comfortable
wind
that
gently
lifted
his
gray
hair
his
face
seemed
then
of
a
faint
smile
to
wear
the
trace
the
other
fixed
his
gaze
upon
the
light
parting
and
when
the
sun
had
vanished
quite
methought
a
starting
tear
that
heaven
might
bless
unfelt
or
felt
with
transient
tenderness
came
to
his
aged
eyes
and
touched
his
cheek
and
then
as
meek
and
silent
as
before
back
hand
in
hand
they
went
and
left
the
shore
as
they
departed
through
the
unheeding
crowd
a
caged
bird
sang
from
the
casement
loud
and
then
i
heard
alone
that
blind
man
say
the
music
of
the
bird
is
sweet
i
said
o
heavenly
father
none
may
know
the
cause
these
have
for
silence
or
for
woe
here
they
appeared
heartstricken
and
resigned
amidst
the
unheeding
tumult
of
mankind
there
is
a
world
a
pure
unclouded
clime
where
there
is
neither
grief
nor
death
nor
time
nor
loss
of
friends
perhaps
when
yonder
bell
pealed
slow
and
bade
the
dying
day
farewell
ere
yet
the
glimmering
landscape
sank
to
night
they
thought
upon
that
world
of
distant
light
and
when
the
blind
man
lifting
light
his
hair
felt
the
faint
wind
he
raised
a
warmer
prayer
then
sighed
as
the
blithe
bird
sang
his
head
no
morn
shall
shine
on
me
till
i
am

that
shook
along
the

whilst
the
sad
shades
of
mail√®d

were
gazing
on

gone
again
on

defaced
sits
darkness
more
profound
and
only
by
the

we
traced
the
shadows
on
the
ground
and
now
the
chilling
freezing
air
without
blew
long
and
loud
upon
our
knees
we
breathed
one
prayer
where
he
slept
in
his
shroud
we
laid
the
broken
marble
floor
no
name
no
trace
appears
and
when
we
closed
the
sounding
door
we
thought
of
him
with
tears
on
seeing
plants
in
the
windows
of
seth
ward
college
endowed
for
widows
of
clergymen
at
salisbury
there
is
but
one
stage
more
in

long
way
o
widowed
women
sadly
upon
your
path
hath
evening
bringing
change
of
scenes
and
friends
descended
since
the
morn
of
hope
shone
fair
and
lonely
age
is
yours
whose
tears
have
fallen
upon
a
husband
grave
with
whom
long
since
amid
the
quietude
of
village
scenes
we
walked
and
saw
your
little
children
grow
like
lovely
plants
beside
you
or
adorned
your
lowly
with
summer
flowers
and
heard
the
bells
upon
the
sabbath
morn
chime
to
the
village
church
when
he
you
loved
walked
by
your
side
to
prayer
these
images
of
days
long
passed
of
love
and
village
life
you
never
can
forget
and
many
a
plant
green
growing
at
the
windows
of
your
home
and
one
pale
primrose
in
small
earthen
vase
and
in
the
sunshine
at
the
door
remember
you
though
in
a
city
pent
of
morning
walks
along
the
village
lane
of
the
lark
singing
through
the
vernal
hail
of
swallows
skimming
the
garden
pond
remember
you
of
children
and
of
friends
parted
and
pleasant
summers
gone
is
meet
to
nurse
such
recollections
not
with
pain
but
in
submission
to
the
will
of
heaven
thankful
that
here
as
the
calm
eve
of
life
in
pious
privacy
steals
on
one
hearth
of
charity
is
yours
and
cold
must
be
that
heart
which
of
the
changes
of
the
world
unmindful
could
receive
you
but
as
guests
who
had
seen
happier
days
yet
one
stage
more
and
your
long
rest
will
be
with
him
you
loved
oh
pray
to
god
that
each
may
rest
in
hope
morley
farewell
to
the
cottage
of
isaak
walton
to
kenna
england
a
long
farewell
a
long
farewell
my
country
to
thy
woods
and
streams
and
hills
where
i
have
heard
in
youth
the
sabbath
bell
for
many
a
year
now
mute
affection
fills
mine
eyes
with
tears
yet
resolute
to
wait
whatever
ills
betide
whatever
fate
far
from
my
native
land
from
sights
of
woe
from
scaffolds
drenched
in
generous
blood
i
go
sad
in
a
land
of
strangers
when
i
bend
with
grief
of
heart
without
a
home
or
friend
and
chiefly
when
with
weary
thoughts
oppressed
i
see
the
sun
sink
slowly
in
the
west
then
doubly
feeling
my
forsaken
lot
i
shall
remember
far
away
this
cot
of
humble
piety
and
prayer
and
peace
and
thee
dear
friend
till
my
heart
beatings
cease
warm
from
that
heart
i
breathe
one
parting
prayer
my
good
old
friend
may
god
almighty
spare
spare
for
the
sake
of
that
poor
child
thy
life
long
spare
it
for
thy
meek
and
duteous
wife
perhaps
them
when
the
hard
storm
blows
loud
we
both
may
be
at
rest
and
in
our
shroud
or
we
may
live
to
talk
of
these
sad
times
when
virtue
was
reviled
and
direst
crimes
faith
awful
name
usurped
we
may
again
hear
heavenly
truths
in
the
fane
and
the
full
chant
oh
if
that
day
arrive
and
we
old
friend
though
bowed
with
age
survive
how
happy
whilst
our
days
on
earth
shall
last
to
pray
and
think
of
seasons
that
are
past
till
on
our
various
way
the
night
shall
close
and
in
one
hallowed
pile
at
last
our
bones
repose
the
grave
of
bishop
ken
on
yonder
heap
of
earth
forlorn
where
ken
his
place
of
burial
chose
peacefully
shine
o
sabbath
morn
and
eve
with
gentlest
hush
repose
to
him
is
reared
no
marble
tomb
within
the
dim
cathedral
fane
but
some
faint
flowers
of
summer
bloom
and
silent
falls
the
wintry
rain
no
village
monumental
stone
records
a
verse
a
date
a
name
what
boots
it
when
thy
task
is
done
christian
how
vain
the
sound
of
fame
oh
far
more
grateful
to
thy
god
the
voices
of
poor
children
rise
who
hasten
the
dewy
sod
to
pay
their
morning
sacrifice
and
can
we
listen
to
their
hymn
heard
haply
when
the
evening
knell
sounds
where
the
village
brow
is
dim
as
if
to
bid
the
world
farewell
without
a
thought
that
from
the
dust
the
morn
shall
wake
the
sleeping
clay
and
bid
the
faithful
and
the
just
upspring
to
heaven
eternal
day
the
legend
of
st
cecilia
and
the
angel
was
when
o
meekest
eve
thy
shadows
dim
were
slowly
stealing
round
with
more
impassioned
sound
divine
cecilia
sang
her
vesper
hymn
and
swelled
the
solemn
chord
in
hallelujahs
to
thy
name
o
lord
and
now
i
see
her
raise
rapt
adoration
gaze
with
lips
just
opening
and
with
humid
eyes
uplifted
whilst
the
strain
now
sinks
now
swells
again
now
rising
seems
to
blend
with
heaven
own
harmonies
but
who
is
that
divinely
fair
with
more
than
mortal
beauty
in
his
mien
with
eyes
of
heavenly
hue
and
glistening
hair
his
white
and
ample
wings
half
seen
o
radiant
and
immortal
guest
why
hast
thou
left
thy
seraph
throng
on
earth
the
triumph
to
attest
of
beauty
piety
and
song
supposed
address
to
bishop
ken
though
his
words
might
well
deceive
me
though
to
earth
abased
i
bend
christian
guide
thou
wilt
not
leave
me
thus
on
earth
without
a
friend
i
thought
his
vows
were
oaths
in
heaven
nor
dare
i
here
my
fault
deny
for
all
my
soul
to
him
was
given
god
knows
how
true
how
tenderly
though
wronged
and
desolate
and
dying
his
pride
his
coldness
i
forgot
and
fell
upon
his
bosom
crying
forsake
me
not
forsake
me
not
i
left
my
father
and
my
mother
whom
i
no
more
on
earth
may
see
but
i
have
found
a
father
brother
and
more
than
every
friend
in
thee
although
his
words
might
well
deceive
me
though
wronged
and
desolate
i
lie
christian
guide
thou
wilt
not
leave
me
oh
teach
me
to
repent
and
die
on
an
eclipse
of
the
moon
at
midnight
up
up
into
the
vast
extended
space
thou
art
ascending
in
thy
majesty
beautiful
moon
the
queen
of
the
pale
sky
but
what
is
that
which
gathers
on
thy
face
a
dark
mysterious
shade
eclipsing
slow
the
splendour
of
thy
calm
and
steadfast
light
it
is
the
shadow
of
this
world
of
woe
of
this
vast
moving
world
portentous
sight
as
if
we
almost
stood
and
saw
more
near
its
very
action
almost
heard
it
roll
on
in
the
swiftness
of
its
dread
career
as
it
hath
rolled
for
ages
hush
my
soul
listen
there
is
no
sound
but
we
could
hear
the
murmur
of
its
multitudes
who
toil
through
their
brief
hour
the
heart
might
well
recoil
but
this
is
ever
sounding
in
his
ear
who
made
it
and
who
said
let
there
be
light
and
we
the
creatures
of
a
mortal
hour
hosts
of
worlds
are
ever
in
his
sight
catching
as
now
dim
glimpses
of
his
power
the
time
shall
come
when
all
this
mighty
scene
darkness
shall
wrap
as
it
had
never
been
o
father
of
all
worlds
be
thou
our
guide
and
lead
us
gently
on
from
youth
to
age
through
the
dark
valley
of
our
pilgrimage
enough
if
thus
bending
to
thy
high
will
we
hold
our
christian
course
through
good
or
ill
and
to
the
end
with
faith
and
hope
abide
to
lady
valletort
on
hearing
her
sing
gloria
in
excelsis
with
three
other
young
ladies
at
lacock
abbey
october
fair
inmate
of
these
ivied
walls
beneath
whose
silent
cloisters
ella
sleeps
in
death
let
loftier
bards
in
rich
and
glowing
lays
thy
gentleness
thy
grace
thy
virtue
praise
be
mine
to
breathe
one
prayer
when
all
rejoice
one
parting
prayer
still
mindful
of
that
voice
and
musing
on
the
sacred
song
which
stole
sweet
as
the
spell
of
peace
upon
the
soul
in
those
same
scenes
where
once
the
chapel
dim
echoed
the
cloistered
sisters
vesper
hymn
live
long
live
happy
tranquil
through
the
strife
and
the
loud
stir
of
this
tumultuous
life
live
long
live
happy
and
when
many
a
day
hath
passed
in
the
heart
harmony
away
when
eve
pale
hand
the
gates
of
life
shall
close
and
hush
the
landscape
to
its
last
repose
may
sister
seraphs
meet
with
welcome
song
and
gently
say
why
have
you
stayed
so
long
on
seeing
a
bust
of
sheridan
from
a
cast
taken
after
death
alas
poor
sheridan
when
first
we
met
was
a
smiling
circle
and
thine
eye
that
flashed
with
eloquent
hilarity
and
playful
fancy
i
remember
yet
freshly
as
yesterday
the
gay
and
fair
the
young
and
beautiful
now
in
their
graves
surrounded
us
while
on
the
lucid
wave
of
hampton
waters
to
the
morning
air
the
streamer
softly
played
of
our
light
boat
which
seemed
as
on
a
magic
sea
to
float
i
saw
thee
after
in
this
crowd
of
life
conflicting
but
yet
blandly
with
its
strife
as
the
still
car
of
time
rolled
on
thy
cheek
wore
the
same
smile
yet
with
a
trace
more
weak
lone
sorrow
came
as
life
declined
and
care
and
age
with
slowly
furrowing
line
was
there
i
could
have
spared
this
fearful
sight
most
strange
is
the
eventful
tale
of
mortal
change
inevitable
but
death
brought
so
nigh
in
form
so
tangible
harrows
the
eye
as
all
the
past
floats
like
a
cloud
away
alas
poor
sheridan
i
turn
and
say
not
without
feelings
which
such
sights
impart
sad
but
instructive
to
the
christian
heart
return
of
george
iii
to
windsor
castle
not
that
thy
name
illustrious
dome
recalls
the
pomp
of
chivalry
in
bannered
halls
the
blaze
of
beauty
and
the
gorgeous
sights
of
heralds
trophies
steeds
and
crested
knights
not
that
young
surrey
there
beguiled
the
hour
with
eyes
upturned
unto
the
maiden
tower
oh
not
for
these
the
muse
officious
brings
her
gratulations
to
the
best
of
kings
but
that
from
cities
and
from
crowds
withdrawn
calm
peace
may
meet
him
on
the
twilight
lawn
that
here
among
these
gray
primeval
trees
he
may
inhale
health
animating
breeze
that
these
old
oaks
which
far
their
shadows
cast
may
soothe
him
while
they
whisper
of
the
past
and
when
from
that
proud
terrace
he
surveys
slow
thames
devolving
his
majestic
maze
now
lost
on
the
horizon
verge
now
seen
winding
through
lawns
and
woods
and
pastures
green
may
he
reflect
upon
the
waves
that
roll
bearing
a
nation
wealth
from
pole
to
pole
and
own
ambition
proudest
boast
above
a
king
best
glory
is
his
country
love
on
meeting
some
friends
of
youth
at
cheltenham
for
the
first
time
since
we
parted
at
oxford
and
wept
to
see
the
paths
of
life
here
the
companions
of
our
careless
prime
whom
fortune
various
ways
have
severed
long
since
that
fair
dawn
when
hope
her
vernal
song
sang
blithe
with
features
marked
by
stealing
time
at
these
restoring
springs
are
met
again

young
adventurers
on

out
together

the

wanderings
in
oblivion

the
parted

once
more
and
pensive
trace
marked
by
that
hand
unseen
whose
iron
pen
writes
mortal
change
upon
the
fronts
of
men
the
creeping
furrows
in

shall
we
meet
again

in

and

and
took
his

a
wanderer
through

journeyed
on

by

through

a

and

gray
at
length
when
one
clear
morn

frost
was
shining
on
the
main
forth
issuing
from
a
castle
gate
he
saw
a
female
train
with
lightsome
step
and
waving
hair
before
them
ran
a
child
and
gathering
from
the
sands
a
shell
ran
back
to
them
and
smiled
himself
unseen
among

a

gather
round

oft
that
little
maiden
eyes
are
glistening
with
a

for
when
the
minstrel
sang
of
wars
at
times
with
softer
sound
he
touched
the
chords
as
mourning
those
now
laid
in
the
cold
ground
he
sang
how
brave
king
richard
pined
in
a
dark
tower
immured
and
of
the
long
and
weary
nights
a
captive
he
endured

be

his

formed

his

by

mourn
ye
bowers
of

ye
pleasant

for
the

his

impatient
came
and
all
this

as
at
the
withering
of
a
demon
curse
was
blasted
then
they
two
went
forth
from

their

derived
they

went

from

on

a
hideous
form
saddening
the
very
sun
and
giant
crimes
have
multiplied
till
to
the
throne
of

and
the
serene
air
of
untroubled
bliss
the
noise
of
violence
and
the
cries
of
blood
have
from

ascended
therefore
god
me
hath
commissioned
to
uplift
the
trump
of
doom
and
sweep
this
world
of
sin
away
written
after
the
consecration
of
the
new
church
at
kingswood
when
first
the
fane
that
white
on
arrests
far
off
the
pausing
stranger
ken
echoed
the
hymn
of
praise
and
on
that
day
which
seemed
to
shine
with
more
auspicious
ray
when
thousands
listened
to
the
prelate
there
who
called
on
god
with
consecrating
prayer
i
saw
a
almost
a
child
even
as
a
cherub
undefiled
from
earth
rank
fume
with
innocent
look
her
eye
meekly
uplifted
to
the
throne
on
high
join
in
the
full
choir
solemn
harmony
oh
then
how
many
boding
thoughts
arose
lest
long
ere
varied
life
uncertain
close
those
looks
of
modesty
that
open
truth
lighting
the
forehead
of
ingenuous
youth
lest
these
as
slowly
steal
maturing
years
should
fade
and
grief
succeed
and
dimming
tears
then
should
the
cheek
be
blanched
with
early
care
sin
mark
its
first
and
furrowing
traces
there
with
touch
corroding
mar
the
altered
mien
and
leave
a
canker
where
the
rose
had
been
then
the
sweet
child
whose
smiles
can
now
impart
joy
overpowering
to
a
mother
heart
might
bring
down
when
not
anxious
love
could
save
that
mother
few
gray
hairs
with
sorrow
to
the
grave
but
hark
the
preacher
voice
his
accents
bland
behold
his
kindled
look
his
lifted
hand
what
holy
fervour
wakes
at
his
command
he
speaks
of
faith
of
mercy
from
above
of
heavenly
hope
of
a
redeemer
love
hence
every
thought
but
that
which
shows
fair
youth
advancing
in
the
paths
of
peace
and
truth
which
shows
thy
light
o
pure
religion
shed
like
a
faint
glory
on
a
daughter
head
who
shall
each
parent
love
through
life
repay
and
add
a
transport
to
their
dying
day
i
saw
an
old
man
on
his
staff
reclined
who
seemed
to
every
human
change
resigned
he
with
white
locks
and
beard
a
patriarch
of
other
years
appeared
and
thine
o
aged
solitary
man
was
life
enchanted
way
when
life
began
the
sunshine
on
each
mountain
and
the
strain
of
some
sweet
melody
in
every
plain
thine
was
illusive
fortune
transient
gleam
and
young
love
broken
but
delicious
dream
those
mocking
visions
of
thy
youth
are
flown
and
thou
dost
bend
on
death
dark
brink
alone
the
light
associates
of
thy
vernal
day
where
are
they
blown
like
the
sere
leaves
away
and
thou
dost
seem
a
trunk
on
whose
bare
head
the
gray
moss
of
uncounted
days
is
spread
i
know
thee
not
old
man
yet
traits
like
these
upon
thy
features
fancy
sees
another
or
another
year
for
thee
haply
the
silver
cord
shall
loosed
be
then
listen
whilst
warm
eloquence
portrays
that
better
country
to
thy
anxious
gaze
who
art
a
weary
pilgrim
here
and
soon
from
life
vain
masque
to
disappear
o
aged
man
lift
up
thine
eyes
behold
what
brighter
views
of
distant
light
unfold
what
though
the
loss
of
strength
thou
dost
deplore
or
broken
loves
or
friends
that
are
no
more
what
though
gay
youth
no
more
his
song
renews
and
dies
like
the
rainbow
hues
the
christian
hails
the
ray
that
cheers
the
gloom
and
throws
its
heavenly
halo
round
the
tomb
who
bade
the
grave
its
mouldering
vault
unclose
christ
christ
who
died
yea
rather
christ
who
rose
hope
lifts
from
earth
her
eye
she
sees
dispersed
the
world
last
tempest
fly
sees
death
arrested
his
havoc
vast
lord
at
thy
feet
his
broken
weapons
cast
in
circles
far
retiring
from
the
sight
till
undistinguished
they
are
lost
in
light
admiring
seraphim
suspend
their
wings
whilst
hark
the
eternal
empyrean
rings
hosannah
lord
of
lords
and
king
of
kings
such
thoughts
arose
when
from
the
crowded
fane
i
saw
retire
the
mute
assembled
train
their
images
beguiled
my
homeward
way
which
high
lansdowne
lonely
summit
lay
there
seemed
a
music
in
the
evening
gale
and
looking
back
on
the
vale
methought
a
blessing
waited
on
the
hour
as
the
last
light
from
heaven
shone
on
the
distant
tower
on
the
death
of
dr
burgess
the
late
bishop
of
salisbury
sainted
old
man
for
more
than
eighty
years
thee
tranquilly
and
age
led
to
the
confines
of
the
sepulchre
and
thy
last
day
on
earth
but
father
lord
which
art
in
heaven
how
pure
a
faith
and
heart
unmoved
amid
the
changes
of
this
life
and
tumult
of
the
world
and
oh
what
hope
what
love
and
constancy
of
the
calm
mind
and
tears
to
misery
from
the
inmost
heart
flowing
at
times
a
brief
sweet
smile
and
voice
how
bland
and
studies
various
and
profound
of
learned
languages
but
ever
first
that
learning
which
the
oracles
of
god
unfolds
even
to
the
close
of
life
long
day
thy
course
accompanies
but
thou
farewell
and
live
this
mortal
veil
removed
in
bliss
live
with
the
saints
in
light
whom
christ
had
loved
but
pardon

left

at

close
the

was
heard

chant
at

came
sounding

died
but
this
pure
fount
through
rolling
years
the

yet
lifts
its
small
still
voice
like
penitence
or
lowly
prayer
then
pass
admonished

from

long

was
thy

thy
christian

loved
like
thee
the
high

holy
strain
of

immortal
master
thou
didst
honour
him
and
none
i
know
who
live
could
even
a
shadow
a
faint

give
with

voice
of
those
rich
harmonies
