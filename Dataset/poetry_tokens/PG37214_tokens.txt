from

my
drowsy
gentleman
and
you
fair
lady
rise
and
braid
your
hair
and
let
the

wash

and

and
bird
in
sun
climbed
on
the
heights
three
hours
ago
he
laughed
above
the
hills
and
they
were
glad
with
bubbled
pearl
he
made
the
rivers
flow
and
laced
their
mists
in
silver
and
he
clad
the
meads
in
fragrant
pomp
of
green
and
gold
and
bade
the
world
forget
it
had
been
lift
yourself
good
sir
and
you
sweet
dame
unlash
your
evening
eyes
of
pious
grey
call
on
the
children
by
each
loved
name
and
set
them
on
the
grass
and
let
them
play
and
play
with
them
a
while
and
sing
with
them
beneath
the
cherry
bush
a
breakfast
time
the
sun
is
always
in
the
sky
whenever
i
get
out
of
bed
and
i
often
wonder
why
it
never
my
sister
said
she
did
not
know
who
did
the
trick
and
that
she
did
not
care
a
bit
and
i
should
eat
my
porridge
quick
i
think
it
mother
wakens
it
in
the
orchard
there
was
a
giant
by
the
orchard
wall
peeping
about
on
this
side
and
on
that
and
feeling
in
the
trees
he
was
as
tall
as
the
big
apple
tree
and
twice
as
fat
his
beard
was
long
and
and
there
were
leaves
and
bits
of
grass
stuck
in
his
hair
he
held
a
great
big
club
in
his
right
hand
and
with
the
other
felt
in
every
tree
for
something
that
he
wanted
you
could
stand
beside
him
and
not
reach
up
to
his
knee
so
mighty
big
he
was
i
feared
he
would
turn
round
and
trample
down
to
where
i
stood
i
tried
to
get
away
but
as
i
slid
under
a
bush
he
saw
me
and
he
bent
far
down
and
said
is
the
princess
hid
i
pointed
to
a
place
and
off
he
went
but
while
he
searched
i
turned
and
simply
flew
round
by
the
lilac
bushes
back
to
you
day
and
night
when
the
bright
eyes
of
the
day
open
on
the
dusk
to
see
mist
and
shadow
fade
away
and
the
sun
shine
merrily
then
i
leave
my
bed
and
run
out
to
frolic
in
the
sun
through
the
sunny
hours
i
play
where
the
stream
is
wandering
plucking
daisies
by
the
way
and
i
laugh
and
dance
and
sing
while
the
birds
fly
here
and
there
singing
on
the
sunny
air
when
the
night
comes
cold
and
slow
and
the
sad
moon
walks
the
sky
when
the
whispering
wind
says
little
boy
and
makes
me
cry
by
my
mother
i
am
led
home
again
and
put
to
bed
the
devil
bag
i
saw
the
devil
walking
down
the
lane
behind
our
there
was
a
heavy
bag
strapped
tightly
on
his
shoulders
and
the
rain
sizzled
when
it
hit
him
he
picked
a
rag
up
from
the
ground
and
put
it
in
his
sack
and
grinned
and
rubbed
his
hands
there
was
a
thing
moving
inside
the
bag
upon
his
back
it
must
have
been
a
soul
i
saw
it
fling
and
twist
about
inside
and
not
a
hole
or
cranny
for
escape
oh
it
was
sad
i
cried
and
shouted
out
out
that
soul
but
he
turned
round
and
sure
his
face
went
mad
and
twisted
up
and
down
and
he
said
and
ran
away
oh
mammy
i
not
well
a
visit
from
abroad
a
speck
went
blowing
up
against
the
sky
as
little
as
a
leaf
then
it
drew
near
and
it
a
bird
said
i
and
fetched
my
bow
and
arrows
it
was
queer
it
grew
up
from
a
speck
into
a
blot
and
squattered
past
a
cloud
then
it
flew
down
all
crumply
and
waggled
such
a
lot
i
thought
the
thing
would
it
was
a
brown
old
carpet
where
a
man
was
sitting
snug
who
when
he
reached
the
ground
began
to
sew
a
big
hole
in
the
middle
of
the
rug
and
kept
on
peeping
everywhere
to
know
who
might
be
coming
then
he
gave
a
twist
and
flew
away
i
fired
at
him
but
missed
the
wood
of
flowers
i
went
to
the
wood
of
flowers
no
one
was
with
me
i
was
there
alone
for
hours
i
was
happy
as
could
be
in
the
wood
of
flowers
there
was
grass
on
the
ground
there
were
buds
on
the
tree
and
the
wind
had
a
sound
of
such
gaiety
that
i
was
as
happy
as
happy
could
be
in
the
wood
of
flowers
the
white
window
the
moon
comes
every
night
to
peep
through
the
window
where
i
lie
and
i
pretend
to
be
asleep
but
i
watch
the
moon
as
it
goes
by
and
it
never
makes
a
sound
it
stands
and
stares
and
then
it
goes
to
the
house
that
next
to
me
stealing
on
its
to
peep
at
folk
asleep
maybe
and
it
never
makes
a
sound
midnight
and
then
i
wakened
up
in
such
a
fright
i
thought
i
heard
a
movement
in
the
room
but
did
not
dare
to
look
i
snuggled
right
down
underneath
the
bedclothes
then
the
boom
of
a
tremendous
voice
said
up
lad
and
let
me
see
your
so
up
i
sat
although
i
did
want
to
i
was
glad
i
did
though
for
it
was
an
angel
that
had
called
me
and
he
said
he
come
to
know
was
i
the
boy
who
would
say
his
prayers
nor
do
his
sums
and
that
i
have
to
go
straight
down
to
hell
because
of
such
affairs
i
said
i
be
converted
and
do
good
if
he
would
let
me
off
he
said
he
would
behind
the
hill
behind
the
hill
i
met
a
man
in
green
who
asked
me
if
my
mother
had
gone
out
i
said
she
had
he
asked
me
had
i
seen
his
castle
where
the
people
sing
and
shout
from
dawn
to
dark
and
told
me
that
he
had
a
crock
of
gold
inside
a
hollow
tree
and
i
could
have
i
wanted
money
bad
to
buy
a
sword
with
and
i
thought
that
he
would
keep
his
solemn
word
so
off
we
went
he
said
he
had
a
pound
hid
in
the
crock
and
owned
the
castle
too
and
paid
no
rent
to
any
one
and
that
you
had
to
knock
five
hundred
times
i
asked
reckoned
up
and
he
said
insulting
little
pup
the
secret
i
was
frightened
for
a
wind
crept
along
the
grass
to
say
something
that
was
in
my
mind
yesterday
something
that
i
did
not
know
could
be
found
out
by
the
wind
i
had
buried
it
so
low
in
my
mind
april
showers
the
leaves
are
fresh
after
the
rain
the
air
is
cool
and
clear
the
sun
is
shining
warm
again
the
sparrows
hopping
in
the
lane
are
brisk
and
full
of
cheer
and
that
is
why
we
dance
and
play
and
that
is
why
we
sing
calling
out
in
voices
gay
we
will
not
go
to
school
or
learn
anything
it
is
a
happy
thing
i
say
to
be
alive
on
such
a
day
the
turn
of
the
road
i
was
playing
with
my
hoop
along
the
road
just
where
the
bushes
are
when
suddenly
there
came
a
i
ran
away
and
stowed
myself
beneath
a
bush
and
watched
to
see
what
made
the
noise
and
then
around
the
bend
i
saw
a
woman
running
she
was
old
and
and
had
big
the
end
of
her
red
shawl
caught
on
a
bush
and
rolled
right
off
her
and
her
hair
fell
her
face
was
awful
white
and
both
her
eyes
looked
sick
and
she
was
talking
queer
god
of
grace
said
she
is
the
child
and
flew
back
quick
the
way
she
came
and
screamed
and
shook
her
hands
maybe
she
was
a
witch
from
foreign
lands
the
coral
island
his
arms
were
round
a
chest
of
oaken
wood
it
was
clamped
with
brass
and
iron
studs
and
seemed
an
awful
weight
after
a
while
he
stood
and
i
stole
near
to
his
white
eyes
gleamed
as
he
peeped
secretly
about
he
laid
the
oaken
chest
upon
the
ground
then
drew
a
great
knife
from
his
belt
and
stuck
the
blade
into
the
ground
and
dug
the
clay
soon
flew
in
all
directions
underneath
a
tree
and
when
the
hole
was
deep
he
put
the
box
down
there
and
threw
the
clay
back
cunningly
stamping
the
ground
quite
flat
then
like
a
fox
he
crept
among
the
trees
i
went
next
day
to
dig
the
treasure
up
but
i
lost
my
way
the
cow
cow
cow
i
and
thou
are
looking
at
each
other
eyes
you
are
lying
on
the
grass
eating
every
time
i
pass
and
you
do
not
seem
to
be
ever
in
perplexity
you
are
good
i
sure
and
not
fit
for
nothing
but
the
pot
for
your
bearing
is
so
kind
and
your
quietness
so
wise
cow
cow
i
and
thou
are
looking
at
each
other
eyes
the
old
man
an
old
man
sat
beneath
a
tree
alone
so
still
was
he
that
if
he
had
been
carved
in
stone
he
could
not
be
more
quiet
or
more
cold
he
was
an
ancient
man
more
than
a
thousand
ages
old
what
the
snake
saw
a
little
girl
and
a
big
ugly
man
went
down
the
road
the
girl
was
crying
and
asking
to
go
home
but
when
she
ran
he
hit
her
on
the
head
and
sent
her
flying
and
called
her
a
young
imp
and
said
he
break
her
neck
unless
she
went
with
him
and
then
he
smacked
her
on
the
i
was
a
snake
at
that
time
crawling
through
a
robber
den
and
diamonds
were
sticking
to
my
tongue
that
the
best
dodge
but
when
i
saw
the
way
he
beat
the
little
girl
i
up
and
flung
a
stone
at
him
my
aim
was
bad
that
day
because
i
hit
the
girl
and
she
did
sing
but
he
jumped
round
and
cursed
like
anything
the
horse
a
sparrow
hopped
about
the
street
and
he
was
not
a
bit
afraid
he
flew
between
a
horse
feet
and
ate
his
supper
undismayed
i
think
myself
the
horse
knew
well
the
bird
came
for
the
grains
that
fell
for
his
eye
was
looking
down
and
he
danced
the
corn
about
in
his
till
the
brown
grains
of
corn
were
tumbled
out
and
i
fancy
that
he
said
eat
it
up
young
the
driver
then
came
back
again
he
climbed
into
the
heavy
dray
and
he
tightened
up
the
rein
cracked
his
whip
and
drove
away
but
when
the
horse
ribs
were
hit
the
sparrow
did
not
care
a
bit
the
apple
tree
i
was
hiding
in
the
crooked
apple
tree
scouting
for
indians
when
a
man
came
i
thought
it
was
an
indian
for
he
was
running
like
the
there
was
a
flame
of
sunlight
on
his
hand
as
he
drew
near
and
then
i
saw
a
knife
gripped
in
his
fist
he
panted
like
a
horse
his
eyes
were
queer
staring
frightfully
and
hist
his
mouth
stared
open
like
another
eye
and
all
his
hair
was
matted
down
with
sweat
i
crouched
among
the
leaves
for
fear
he
spy
where
i
was
hiding
so
he
did
not
get
his
awful
eyes
on
me
but
like
the
wind
he
fled
as
if
he
heard
something
behind
the
appointment
tree
you
are
years
standing
there
gripping
tight
to
the
side
of
the
hill
and
your
branches
are
spread
on
the
air
while
you
stand
so
sad
and
so
still
and
you
do
not
complain
when
you
wet
with
the
rain
though
i
think
you
have
often
been
ill
i
would
like
but
it
could
not
be
done
so
you
must
not
keep
me
to
my
word
to
take
you
away
when
the
sun
goes
down
and
the
breezes
are
stirred
and
hug
you
in
bed
with
myself
till
you
said
that
to
sleep
on
a
hill
was
absurd
o
beautiful
tree
when
the
night
is
dark
and
the
winds
come
and
scold
i
would
love
then
to
cuddle
you
tight
for
i
fear
you
will
die
of
the
cold
but
you
are
so
tall
and
my
bed
is
so
small
that
it
could
not
be
done
i
am
told
my
mother
is
calling
for
me
and
the
baby
is
wanting
to
play
i
shall
have
to
go
home
now
you
see
but
i
give
you
a
kiss
if
i
may
i
would
stay
if
i
could
but
a
child
must
be
good
so
i
must
darling
tree
go
away
i
will
leave
you
my
pencil
and
slate
and
this
little
pin
from
my
frock
but
now
i
must
go
for
it
late
and
my
mother
is
rattling
the
lock
so
darling
dear
i
come
back
never
fear
in
the
morning
at
seven
check
the
night
was
creeping
on
the
ground
she
crept
and
did
not
make
a
sound
until
she
reached
the
tree
and
then
she
covered
it
and
stole
again
along
the
grass
beside
the
wall
i
heard
the
rustle
of
her
shawl
as
she
threw
blackness
everywhere
upon
the
sky
and
ground
and
air
and
in
the
room
where
i
was
hid
but
no
matter
what
she
did
to
everything
that
was
without
she
could
not
put
my
candle
out
so
i
stared
at
the
night
and
she
stared
back
solemnly
at
me
when
i
was
young
i
will
not
know
when
i
am
dead
if
sun
or
moon
is
overhead
i
stretch
out
flat
without
a
sound
inside
a
box
beneath
the
ground
and
never
rise
again
to
see
branches
lifting
on
a
tree
nor
hear
the
song
the
finches
sing
in
the
spring
i
not
while
sunny
ages
go
lift
a
hand
or
wag
a
toe
but
in
a
wooden
box
will
be
hidden
for
eternity
from
sea
and
sun
from
sight
and
sound
from
touch
of
people
voice
of
friend
from
all
that
makes
my
heart
to
bound
denying
such
an
end
it
is
so
strange
i
wonder
why
people
die
the
rocky
road
to
dublin
the
patriot
bed
when
a
son
you
shall
desire
pray
to
water
and
to
fire
but
when
you
would
have
a
daughter
pray
to
fire
and
then
to
water
grafton
street
at
four
in
dainty
talk
lords
and
lovely
ladies
walk
with
a
gentle
dignity
from
the
green
to
trinity
and
at
five
they
take
in
a
café
tea
and
cake
then
they
call
a
carriage
and
drive
back
into
fairyland
portobello
bridge
silver
stars
shine
peacefully
the
canal
is
silver
the
poplars
bear
with
modest
grace
gossamers
of
silver
lace
and
the
turf
bank
wears
with
glee
black
and
silver
filigree
york
street
if
in
winter
you
shall
drive
birds
from
crumbs
you
shall
not
thrive

than

i
was

when
a

came

in

anybody

the

he
who

without

shall
gather
rubies
from

at

the

shall
never

and
the

shall
never

man
see
the
greedy
taking
everything
he
can
from

not

the

walked
out
in
my
coat
of
pride
i
looked
about
on
every
side
and
said
the
mountains
should
not
be
just
where
they
were
and
that
the
sea
was
badly
placed
and
that
the
beech
should
be
an
oak
and
then
from
each
i
turned
in
dignity
as
if
they
were
not
there
i
sniffed
a
sniff

climbed
upon

sneezed
