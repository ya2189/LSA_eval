part
i
indoors
the
long
view
within
my
house
the
housewife
to
mother
in
such
an
hour
the
daily
interview
the
little
house
the
a
woman
in
hospital
in
convalescence
homesick
on
washing
day
when
baby
strayed
if
only
listening
the
dear
folks
in
devon
the
reason
two
women
the
prize
fight
the
home
lights
to
an
old
teapot
to
a
rebellious
daughter
for
mothering
little
fan
the
naughty
day
to
a
little
white
bird
because
when
he
comes
part
ii
out
of
doors
early
spring
the
witness
in
somerset
song
of
a
woodland
stream
luggage
in
advance
at
the
cross
roads
summer
met
me
the
carrier
the
lad
love
by
the
gate
the
thrush
in
dorset
dear
the
flight
of
the
fairies
the
street
player
on
all
souls
eve
the
log
fire
god
save
the
king
dedicated
to
my
first
love
my
mother
part
indoors
the
long
view
some
day
of
days
some
dawning
yet
to
be
i
shall
be
clothed
with
immortality
and
in
that
day
i
shall
not
greatly
care
that
jane
spilt
candle
grease
upon
the
stair
it
will
not
grieve
me
then
as
once
it
did
that
careless
hands
have
chipped
my
teapot
lid
i
groan
being
burdened
but
in
that
glad
day
i
shall
forget
vexations
of
the
way
that
needs
were
often
great
when
means
were
small
will
not
perplex
me
any
more
at
all
a
few
short
years
at
most
it
may
be
less
i
shall
have
done
with
earthly
storm
and
stress
so
for
this
day
i
lay
me
at
thy
feet
o
keep
me
sweet
my
master
keep
me
sweet
within
my
house
first
there
the
entrance
narrow
and
so
small
the
seems
to
fill
the
tiny
hall
that
staircase
too
has
such
an
awkward
bend
the
carpet
rucks
and
rises
up
on
end
then
all
the
rooms
are
cramped
and
close
together
and
there
a
musty
smell
in
rainy
weather
yes
and
it
makes
the
daily
work
go
hard
to
have
the
only
tap
across
a
yard
these
creaking
doors
these
draughts
this
battered
paint
would
try
i
think
the
temper
of
a
saint
how
often
had
i
railed
against
these
things
with
envies
and
with
bitter
murmurings
for
spacious
rooms
and
sunny
garden
plots
until
one
day
washing
the
breakfast
dishes
so
i
think
i
paused
a
moment
in
my
work
to
pray
and
then
and
there
all
life
seemed
suddenly
made
new
and
fair
for
like
the
psalmist
dove
among
the
pots
those
endless
pots
that
filled
the
tiny
sink
my
spirit
found
her
wings
lord
thus
i
prayed
it
matters
not
at
all
that
my
poor
home
is
and
small
i
not
the
house
am
straitened
lord
is
i
enlarge
my
foolish
heart
that
i
may
look
up
with
such
a
radiant
face
thou
shalt
have
glory
even
in
this
place
and
when
i
trip
or
stumble
unawares
in
carrying
water
up
these
awkward
stairs
then
keep
me
sweet
and
teach
me
day
by
day
to
tread
with
patience
thy
appointed
way
as
for
the
house
lord
let
it
be
my
part
to
walk
within
it
with
a
perfect
heart
the
housewife
see
i
am
cumbered
lord
with
serving
and
with
small
tious
things
upstairs
and
down
my
feet
must
hasten
sure
and
fleet
so
weary
that
i
can
not
heed
thy
word
so
tired
i
can
not
now
mount
up
with
wings
i
wrestle
how
i
wrestle
through
the
hours
nay
not
with
principalities
nor
powers
dark
spiritual
foes
of
god
and
man
but
with
antagonistic
pots
and
pans
with
footmarks
in
the
hall
with
smears
upon
the
wall
with
doubtful
ears
and
small
unwashen
hands
and
with
a
babe
innumerable
demands
i
toil
with
feverish
haste
while
glisten
o
child
of
mine
be
still
and
listen
listen
at
last
i
laid
aside
important
work
no
other
hands
could
do
so
well
i
thought
no
skill
contrive
so
true
and
with
my
heart
door
open
open
wide
with
leisured
feet
and
idle
hands
i
sat
i
foolish
fussy
blind
as
any
bat
sat
down
to
listen
and
to
learn
and
lo
my
thousand
tasks
were
done
the
better
so
to
mother
i
would
that
you
should
know
dear
mother
that
i
love
you
love
you
so
that
i
remember
other
days
and
years
remember
childish
joys
and
childish
fears
and
this
because
my
baby
little
hand
opened
my
own
heart
door
and
made
me
understand
i
wonder
how
you
could
be
always
kind
and
good
so
quick
to
hear
to
tend
my
smallest
ills
to
lend
such
sympathising
ears
swifter
than
ancient
seer
i
never
yet
knew
hands
so
soft
and
kind
nor
any
cheek
so
smooth
nor
any
mind
so
full
of
tender
dear
mother
now
i
think
that
i
can
guess
a
little
how
you
must
have
looked
for
some
response
some
sign
that
all
my
tiresome
wayward
heart
was
thine
and
sure
it
was
you
were
my
first
dear
love
you
who
first
pointed
me
to
god
above
you
who
seemed
hearkening
to
my
lightest
word
and
in
the
dark
night
seasons
always
heard
when
i
came
trembling
knocking
at
your
door
forgive
me
mother
if
my
whims
outwore
your
patient
heart
or
if
in
later
days
i
sought
out
foolish
unfamiliar
ways
if
ever
mother
dear
i
loosed
my
hold
of
your
loved
hand
or
headstrong
thought
you
cold
forgive
me
mother
oh
forgive
me
dear
i
am
come
back
at
last
you
see
me
here
your
loving
and
mother
on
my
knee
i
pray
that
thus
my
child
may
think
of
me
in
such
an
hour
sometimes
when
everything
goes
wrong
when
days
are
short
and
nights
are
long
when
brings
so
dull
a
sky
that
not
a
single
thing
will
dry
and
when
the
kitchen
chimney
smokes
and
when
there
naught
so
queer
as
folks
when
friends
deplore
my
faded
youth
and
when
the
baby
cuts
a
tooth
while
john
the
baby
last
but
one
clings
round
my
skirts
till
day
is
done
when
fat
jane
is
glum
and
butcher
man
forgets
to
come
sometimes
i
say
on
days
like
these
i
get
a
sudden
gleam
of
bliss
not
on
some
sunny
day
of
ease
he
come
but
on
a
day
like
this
and
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
these
tiresome
things
will
all
go
by
and
is
a
curious
thing
but
jane
is
sure
just
then
to
smile
again
or
out
the
truant
sun
will
peep
and
both
the
babies
fall
asleep
the
fire
burns
up
with
roar
sublime
and
butcher
man
is
just
in
time
and
oh
my
feeble
faith
grows
strong
sometimes
when
everything
goes
wrong
the
daily
interview
such
a
sensation
sunday
preacher
made
christian
he
cried
what
is
your
alas
too
often
nil
no
time
to
pray
no
interview
with
christ
from
day
to
day
a
hurried
prayer
maybe
just
gabbled
through
a
random
text
for
any
one
will
do
then
gently
lovingly
with
look
intense
he
leaned
towards
us
is
this
common
sense
no
person
in
his
rightful
mind
will
try
to
run
his
business
so
lest
the
thing
collapses
smirching
his
good
name
and
he
insolvent
face
the
world
with
shame
i
heard
it
all
and
something
inly
said
that
all
was
true
the
daily
toil
and
press
had
crowded
out
my
hopes
of
holiness
still
my
old
self
rose
reasoning
how
can
you
with
strenuous
work
to
do
real
slogging
work
say
how
can
you
keep
pace
with
leisured
folks
why
you
could
grow
in
grace
if
you
had
time
the
daily
interview
was
never
meant
for
those
who
wash
and
bake
but
yet
a
small
voice
whispered
for
my
sake
keep
tryst
with
me
there
are
so
many
minutes
in
a
day
so
spare
me
ten
it
shall
be
proven
then
ten
minutes
set
apart
can
well
repay
you
shall
accomplish
more
if
you
will
shut
your
door
for
ten
short
minutes
just
to
watch
and
pray
lord
if
i
do
set
ten
apart
for
you
i
dared
yes
dared
to
reason
thus
with
him
the
baker
sure
to
come
or
jane
will
call
to
say
some
visitor
is
in
the
hall
or
i
shall
smell
the
porridge
burning
yes
and
run
to
stop
it
in
my
hastiness
there
not
ten
minutes
lord
in
all
the
day
i
can
be
sure
of
peace
in
which
to
watch
and
pray
but
all
that
night
with
calm
insistent
might
that
gentle
voice
spake
softly
lovingly
keep
tryst
with
me
you
have
devised
a
dozen
different
ways
of
getting
easy
meals
on
washing
days
you
spend
much
anxious
thought
on
hopeless
socks
on
moving
ironmould
from
tiny
frocks
was
you
who
found
a
way
to
make
the
sugar
lumps
go
round
you
who
invented
ways
and
means
of
making
nice
spicy
buns
for
tea
hot
from
the
baking
when
margarine
was
short
and
not
you
who
made
the
time
to
join
the
butter
queue
make
time
again
for
me
yes
will
you
not
with
all
your
daily
striving
use
woman
wit
in
scheming
and
triving
to
keep
that
tryst
with
me
like
ice
long
bound
on
powdered
frosty
ground
my
erring
will
all
suddenly
gave
way
the
kind
soft
wind
of
his
sweet
pleading
blew
and
swiftly
silently
before
i
knew
the
warm
love
loosed
and
ran
floods
began
and
so
most
lovingly
i
answered
him
lord
yes
i
will
and
can
i
will
keep
tryst
with
thee
lord
come
what
may
envoy
it
is
a
wondrous
and
surprising
thing
how
that
ten
minutes
takes
the
piercing
sting
from
vexing
circumstance
and
ous
dart
hurled
by
the
enemy
straight
at
my
heart
so
to
the
woman
and
tried
by
household
cares
and
hosts
of
things
beside
with
all
my
strength
god
bids
me
say
to
you
dear
soul
do
try
the
daily
interview
the
little
house
one
yestereve
in
the
waning
light
when
the
wind
was
still
and
the
gloaming
bright
there
came
a
breath
from
a
far
countrie
and
the
ghost
of
a
little
house
called
to
me
have
you
forgotten
me
no
i
cried
your
hall
was
as
narrow
as
this
is
wide
your
roof
was
leaky
the
rain
came
through
till
a
ceiling
fell
on
my
new
frock
too
in
your
parlour
flooring
a
loose
board
hid
and
wore
the
carpet
you
know
it
did
your
kitchen
was
small
and
the
shelves
were
few
while
the
fireplace
smoked
and
you
know
it
true
the
little
ghost
sighed
do
you
quite
forget
my
window
boxes
of
mignonette
and
the
sunny
room
where
you
used
to
sew
when
a
great
hope
came
to
you
long
ago
ah
me
how
you
used
to
watch
the
door
where
a
turned
on
the
stroke
of
four
and
you
made
the
tea
and
you
poured
it
out
from
an
old
brown
pot
with
a
broken
spout
now
times
have
changed
and
your
footman
waits
with
the
silver
urn
and
the
fluted
plates
but
the
little
blind
love
with
the
wings
has
flown
who
used
to
sit
by
your
warm
stone
the
little
ghost
paused
then
away
i
said
back
to
your
place
with
the
quiet
dead
back
to
your
place
lest
my
servants
see
that
the
ghost
of
a
little
house
calls
to
me
the
across
the
town
the
evening
bell
is
ringing
clear
comes
the
call
through
kitchen
windows
winging
lord
knowing
thou
art
kind
i
heed
thy
call
to
prayer
i
have
a
soul
to
save
a
heart
which
needs
i
think
a
double
share
of
sweetnesses
which
noble
ladies
crave
hope
faith
and
diligence
and
patient
care
with
meekness
grace
and
lowliness
of
mind
lord
wilt
thou
grant
all
these
to
one
who
prays
but
can
not
sit
at
ease
they
do
not
know
the
who
go
up
to
thy
house
with
saintly
faces
set
who
throng
about
thy
seat
and
sing
thy
praises
sweet
till
vials
full
of
odours
cloud
thy
feet
they
do
not
know
and
if
they
knew
then
would
they
greatly
care
that
thy
tired
handmaid
washed
the
children
hair
or
with
red
roughened
hands
scoured
dishes
well
while
through
the
window
called
the
evening
bell
and
that
her
seeking
soul
looks
upward
yet
they
do
not
know
but
thou
wilt
not
forget
a
woman
in
hospital
i
know
it
all
i
know
for
i
am
god
i
am
jehovah
he
who
made
you
what
you
are
and
i
can
see
the
tears
that
wet
your
pillow
night
by
night
when
nurse
has
lowered
that
light
when
the
talk
ceases
and
the
ward
grows
still
and
you
have
doffed
your
will
i
know
the
anguish
and
the
helplessness
i
know
the
fears
that
toss
you
to
and
fro
and
how
you
wrestle
weariful
with
hosts
of
little
strings
that
pull
about
your
heart
and
tear
it
so
i
know
lord
do
you
know
i
had
no
time
to
put
clean
curtains
up
no
time
to
finish
darning
all
the
socks
nor
sew
clean
frilling
in
the
frocks
and
do
you
know
about
my
baby
cold
and
how
things
are
with
my
sweet
will
jane
remember
right
their
cough
mixture
at
night
and
will
she
ever
think
to
brush
the
kitchen
flues
or
scrub
the
sink
and
then
there
john
poor
tired
lonely
john
no
one
will
run
to
put
his
slippers
on
and
not
a
soul
but
me
knows
just
exactly
how
he
likes
his
tea
it
rends
my
heart
to
think
i
can
not
go
and
minister
to
i
know
i
know
then
there
are
other
things
dear
lord
more
little
strings
that
pull
my
heart
now
baby
feels
her
feet
she
loves
to
run
outside
into
the
street
and
jane
hands
are
so
full
she
never
and
i
quite
sure
the
clean
clothes
be
aired
at
least
not
properly
and
oh
i
ca
i
really
ca
be
spared
my
little
house
calls
so
i
know
and
i
am
waiting
here
to
help
and
bless
lay
down
your
head
lay
down
your
lessness
and
let
me
speak
you
are
so
weary
child
you
are
so
weak
but
let
us
reason
out
the
darkness
and
the
doubt
this
torturing
fear
that
tosses
you
about
i
hold
the
universe
i
count
the
stars
and
out
of
shortened
lives
i
build
the
but
lord
while
such
high
things
thy
thought
engages
i
fear
forgive
me
lest
amid
those
limitless
eternal
spaces
thou
shouldest
in
the
high
and
heavenly
places
pass
over
my
affairs
as
things
of
nought
there
are
so
many
houses
just
like
mine
and
i
so
and
thyself
divine
it
seems
impossible
that
thou
shouldst
care
just
what
my
babies
wear
and
what
john
gets
to
eat
and
can
it
be
a
circumstance
of
great
concern
to
thee
whether
i
live
or
die
have
you
forgotten
then
my
child
that
i
the
infinite
the
limitless
laid
down
the
method
of
existence
that
i
knew
and
took
on
me
a
nature
just
like
you
i
laboured
day
by
day
in
the
same
dogged
way
that
you
have
tackled
household
tasks
and
then
remember
child
remember
once
again
your
own
beloveds
did
you
really
think
those
days
you
toiled
to
get
their
meat
and
drink
and
made
their
clothes
and
tried
to
stand
their
little
ailments
did
you
think
your
hand
your
feeble
hand
was
keeping
them
from
ill
i
gave
them
life
and
life
is
more
than
meat
those
little
limbs
so
comely
and
so
sweet
you
can
make
raiment
for
them
and
are
glad
but
can
you
add
one
cubit
to
their
stature
yet
they
grow
oh
child
hands
off
hands
off
and
leave
them
so
i
guarded
hitherto
i
guard
them
still
i
have
let
go
at
last
i
have
let
go
and
oh
the
rest
it
is
dear
god
to
know
my
dear
ones
are
so
safe
for
thou
wilt
keep
hands
off
at
last
now
i
can
go
to
sleep
in
convalescence
not
long
ago
i
prayed
for
dying
grace
for
then
i
thought
to
see
thee
face
to
face
and
now
i
ask
lord
is
a
cry
that
thou
wilt
give
me
grace
to
live
not
die
such
foolish
prayers
i
know
yet
pray
i
must
lord
help
me
help
me
not
to
see
the
dust
and
not
to
nag
nor
fret
because
the
blind
hangs
crooked
and
the
curtain
sags
hind
but
oh
the
kitchen
cupboards
what
a
sight
take
at
least
a
month
to
get
them
right
and
that
last
cocoa
had
a
smoky
taste
and
all
the
milk
has
boiled
away
to
waste
and
no
i
resolutely
will
not
think
about
the
saucepans
nor
about
the
sink
these
light
afflictions
are
but
temporal
things
to
rise
above
them
wilt
thou
lend
me
wings
then
i
shall
smile
when
jane
with
towzled
hair
and
lumpy
gruel
clatters
up
the
stair
homesick
i
shut
my
eyes
to
rest
just
a
bit
ago
it
seems
an
back
among
the
cotswolds
i
were
wanderin
in
me
dreams
i
saw
the
old
grey
homestead
with
the
rickyard
set
around
an
catched
the
lowin
of
the
herd
a
pleasant
homelike
sound
then
on
i
went
through
the
pastures
where
the
sheep
was
lyin
underneath
the
elms
for
to
sleep
an
where
the
stream
was
tricklin
by
half
stifled
by
the
grass
heaped
over
thick
with
buttercups
i
saw
the
corncrake
pass
for
was
summer
summer
summer
an
the
blue
wiped
out
this
dusty
city
and
the
smoky
chimbley
pots
i
clean
forgot
my
lady
gown
the
dazzlin
sights
i
seen
i
was
back
among
the
cotswolds
where
me
heart
has
always
been
then

on

went
a
stiffish
climb
right
to
the
bridge

sheep

shearin
time

was
the
wild
briar
roses
down

pink
an
sweet
o
their
fragrance

the
clover
at
my
feet

by
gatcombe
wood

lad

workin
with
his
team

my
lad

come

tricklin

because
you
see
at
home
they
ca
put
up
with
me
when
baby
strayed
when
baby
strayed
it
seemed
to
me
sun
moon
and
stars
waned
suddenly
at
once
with
frenzied
haste
my
feet
ran
up
and
down
the
busy
street
if
ever
in
my
life
i
prayed
it
was
the
evening
baby
strayed
and
yet
my
great
concern
was
this
not
dread
of
losing
baby
kiss
and
baby
soft
small
hand
in
mine
and
baby
comradeship
divine
was
baby
terror
baby
fears
whose
hand
but
mine
could
dry
her
tears
i
without
baby
in
my
need
i
were
a
piteous
soul
indeed
but
piteous
far
beyond
all
other
a
little
child
without
a
mother
and
god
in
mercy
graciously
gave
my
lost
darling
back
to
me
o
high
and
lofty
one
thou
couldst
have
lived
to
all
eternity
apart
from
me
in
majesty
upon
that
emerald
throne
thou
with
thy
morning
stars
thy
dawns
with
golden
bars
and
all
the
music
of
the
heavenly
train
possessing
all
things
what
hadst
thou
to
gain
by
seeking
me
what
was
i
and
what
am
i
less
than
nought
and
yet
thy
mercy
sought
yea
thou
hast
set
my
feet
upon
the
way
of
holiness
and
sweet
it
is
to
seek
thee
daily
unafraid
but
this
i
learnt
the
night
that
baby
strayed
here
was
thy
chief
thy
great
concern
for
me
my
desolate
estate
apart
from
thee
if
only
if
only
dinner
cooked
itself
and
groceries
grew
upon
the
shelf
if
children
did
as
they
were
told
and
never
had
a
cough
or
cold
and
washed
their
hands
and
wiped
their
boots
and
never
tore
their
sunday
suits
but
always
tidied
up
the
floor
nor
once
forgot
to
shut
the
door
if
john
remembered
not
to
throw
his
papers
on
the
ground
and
oh
if
he
would
put
his
pipes
away
and
shake
the
ashes
on
the
tray
instead
of
on
the
floor
close
by
and
always
spread
his
towel
to
dry
and
hung
his
hat
upon
the
peg
and
never
had
bones
in
his
leg
then
there
another
thing
if
jane
would
put
the
matches
back
again
just
where
she
found
them
it
would
be
a
save
of
time
to
her
and
me
and
if
she
never
did
forget
to
put
the
dustbin
out
nor
yet
contrive
to
gossip
with
the
baker
nor
need
ten
thunderbolts
to
wake
her
ahem
if
wishes
all
came
true
i
do
know
what
i
find
to
do
because
if
no
one
made
a
mess
there
be
no
need
of
cleanliness
and
things
might
work
so
blissfully
in
time
who
knows
they
not
need
me
and
this
being
so
i
fancy
whether
i
go
on
keeping
things
together
listening
his
step
ah
no
is
but
the
rain
that
hurtles
on
the
window
pane
let
draw
the
curtains
close
and
sit
beside
the
fire
awhile
and
knit
two
purl
two
plain
a
sock
and
warm
i
thought
i
heard
a
knock
but
was
the
slam
of
jones
door
yes
good
scotch
yarn
is
far
before
the
fleecy
wools
a
different
thing
and
best
for
wear
was
that
his
ring
no
is
the
muffin
man
i
see
we
have
threepennyworth
for
tea
two
plain
two
purl
that
heel
is
neat
i
hear
his
step
far
down
the
street

plain
the
sock
can
wait
i
make
the
tea
he
at
the
gate
the
dear
folks
in
devon

i
thinking
of
the
mistletoe
and
holly
berries
bright
the
smoke
above
our
chimbley
pots
dearly
love
to
see
and
those
dear
folks
down
in
devon
how
they
talk
and
think
of
me
owd
ben

the
letters

and
if
there
one
as
comes
across
from
canada
straight
from
their
absent

and
my
dad
likely

like

more
with
our
dear
lad

can
see
carve
the
christmas
beef
and
brother
jimmy

in
all
her
life
and
sister
martha
christmas
pies
melt
in
your
mouth
is
true
but
was
mother
made
the
puddin
as
mothers
always
do
ah
me
if
i
could
just
have
wings
and
in
the
dimsey
light
go
stealing
up
the
cobbled
path
this
lonesome
christmas
night
lift
up
the
latch
with
gentle
hand
my
what
a
shout
there
be
from
those
dear
folks
down
in
devon
what
a
welcomin
for
me
the
reason
why
shouldest
thou
be
as
a
wayfaring
man
that
turneth
aside
to
tarry
for
a
night
jer
xiv
nay
do
not
get
the
venison
pasty
out
i
shall
not
greatly
put
myself
about
hungry
he
may
be
yes
and
we
shall
spare
some
bread
and
cheese
is
truly
some
fare
we
have
dinner
still
to
find
it
well
for
you
i
have
a
frugal
mind
not
the
best
bed
no
no
whatever
next
why
with
such
questionings
should
i
be
vext
the
man
is
naught
to
us
why
should
we
care
the
little
attic
room
will
do
is
bare
but
he
be
gone
before
light
he
has
but
come
to
tarry
for
a
night
i
shall
not
speak
with
him
oh
no
not
i
lest
i
should
pity
overmuch
or
buy
some
paltry
ware
of
his
nay
i
to
bed
and
he
can
sup
alone
well
warmed
and
fed
is
much
to
take
him
in
a
night
like
this
why
should
i
fret
me
with
concerns
of
his
grey
morning
came
and
at
the
break
of
day
the
man
rose
up
and
went
upon
his
way
two
women
i
beseech
euodias
and
beseech
syntyche
that
they
be
of
the
same
mind
in
the
lord
phil
iv
euodias
but
if
paul
heard
her
tattlings
i
am
sure
he
never
would
expect
me
to
endure
there
is
a
something
in
her
very
face
antagonistic
to
the
work
of
grace
and
even
when
i
would
speak
graciously
somehow
syntyche
manner
ruffles
me
syntyche
no
not
for
worlds
euodias
has
no
mind
so
slow
she
is
so
spiritually
blind
her
tongue
is
quite
unbridled
yet
she
says
she
grieves
to
see
my
aggravating
ways
ah
no
one
but
myself
knows
perfectly
how
odious
euodias
can
be
euodias
yet
in
the
lord
ah
that
another
thing
syntyche
yet
in
the
lord
that
alters
it
deed
euodias
for
his
sake
i
endure
her
whispering
syntyche
for
his
sake
i
consent
to
let
her
lead
euodias
lord
teach
me
to
forbear
yes
day
by
day
syntyche
lord
keep
me
gentle
now
and
all
the
way
the
prize
fight
i
am
a
boxer
who
does
not
inflict
blows
on
the
air
but
i
hit
hard
and
straight
at
my
own
body
cor
ix
weymouth
translation
breakfast
time
and
outside
in
the
street
the
factory
men
went
by
with
hurrying
feet
and
on
the
bridge
in
dim
december
light
the
newsboys
shouted
of
the
great
prize
fight
then
as
i
dished
the
bacon
and
served
out
the
porridge
all
our
youngsters
gave
a
shout
the
had
clicked
and
through
the
din
the
picture
news
was
suddenly
pushed
in
john
showed
the
lads
the
pictures
and
explained
just
how
the
fight
took
place
and
what
was
gained
by
that
slim
winner
then
he
looked
at
me
as
i
sat
busy
pouring
out
the
tea
your
mother
is
a
boxer
rightly
styled
she
hits
the
air
sometimes
though
and
john
smiled
yet
she
fights
on
young
jack
with
widened
eyes
said
dad
how
soon
will
mother
get
a
prize
we
laughed
and
yet
it
set
me
thinking
how
i
beat
the
air
because
a
neighbour
cow
munched
at
our
early
cabbages
and
ate
the
lettuce
up
and
tramped
my
ette
and
many
a
time
i
kicked
against
the
pricks
because
the
little
dog
at
number
six
disturbed
my
rest
and
then
how
cross
i
got
when
jane
seemed
discontented
with
her
lot
until
poor
john
in
desperation
said
he
wearied
of
the
theme
and
went
to
bed
and
how
i
vexed
myself
that
day
when
he
brought
people
unexpectedly
for
tea
because
the
was
old
and
stained
and
not
a
single
piece
of
cake
remained
and
how
my
poor
head
ached
because
well
there
it
uses
lots
of
strength
to
beat
the
air
i
am
a
boxer
here
and
now
i
pray
for
grace
to
hit
the
every
day
and
when
the
old
annoyance
comes
once
more
and
the
old
temper
rises
sharp
and
sore
i
shall
hit
hard
and
straight
o
wise
and
read
approval
in
thy
loving
eyes
the
home
lights
in
my
father
house
the
words
bring
sweet
cadence
to
my
ears
wandering
thoughts
like
homing
birds
fly
all
swiftly
down
the
years
to
that
wide
casement
where
i
always
see
bright
leaning
out
to
welcome
me
sweet
it
was
how
sweet
to
go
to
the
worn
familiar
door
no
need
to
stand
a
while
and
wait
outside
the
gate
no
need
to
knock
the
easy
lock
turned
almost
of
itself
and
so
my
spirit
was
at
home
once
more
and
then
within
how
good
to
find
the
same
cool
atmosphere
of
peace
where
i
a
tired
child
might
cease
to
grieve
or
dread
or
toil
for
bread
i
could
forget
the
dreary
fret
the
strivings
after
hopes
too
high
i
let
them
every
one
go
by
the
ills
of
life
the
blows
unkind
these
fearsome
things
were
left
behind
envoy
o
trembling
soul
of
mine
see
how
god
mercies
shine
when
thou
shalt
rise
and
stripped
of
earth
shall
stand
within
an
unknown
land
alone
where
no
familiar
thing
may
bring
familiar
comforting
look
up
is
but
thy
house
and
see
his
leaning
out
to
welcome
thee
to
an
old
teapot
now
from
the
dust
of
things
you
rise
to
haunt
me
at
the
year
cleaning
and
bring
to
memory
dim
imaginings
of
mystic
meaning
no
potter
handled
you
i
ween
nor
yet
were
you
of
gold
or
silver
molten
no
derby
stamp
nor
worcester
can
be
seen
nor
royal
doulton
you
never
stood
to
grace
the
princely
board
of
monarchs
in
some
oriental
palace
your
lid
is
chipped
your
chubby
side
is
scored
as
if
in
malice
i
hesitate
to
say
it
but
your
spout
is
with
unhandsome
rivets
held
together
mute
witnesses
of
treatment
meted
out
in
regions
nether
o
patient
sufferer
of
many
bumps
i
ask
it
gently
shall
the
dustbin
hold
you
and
will
the
with
its
cabbage
stumps
at
last
enfold
you
it
ought
and
yet
with
gentle
hands
i
place
you
with
my
priceless
delft
and
dresden
china
for
sake
of
one
who
loved
your
homely
face
in
days
diviner
to
a
rebellious
daughter
you
call
authority
a
grievous
thing
with
careless
hands
you
snap
the
leading
string
and
for
a
frolic
so
it
seems
to
you
put
off
the
old
love
and
put
on
the
new
for
what
does
mother
know
of
love
you
say
did
her
soul
ever
thrill
did
little
tendernesses
ever
creep
into
her
dreams
and
her
will
did
her
eyes
shine
or
her
heart
ever
leap
as
my
heart
leaps
i
who
am
young
who
long
to
try
my
wings
how
should
she
understand
she
with
her
calm
cool
hand
she
never
felt
such
yearnings
and
beside
it
clear
i
ca
be
tied
for
ever
to
my
mother
apron
strings
there
are
infinities
of
knowledge
dear
and
there
are
mysteries
not
yet
made
clear
to
you
the
life
book
is
open
yes
but
you
may
only
look
at
its
first
section
youth
is
part
not
all
the
truth
it
is
impossible
that
you
should
see
the
end
from
the
beginning
perfectly
you
answer
even
so
but
how
can
mother
know
who
meditates
upon
the
price
of
bacon
on
the
charwoman
has
taken
and
on
the
laundry
last
atrocities
she
knows
her
cookery
book
and
how
a
joint
of
english
meat
should
look
but
all
such
things
as
these
make
up
her
life
she
dwells
in
tents
but
i
in
a
vast
temple
open
to
the
sky
yet
time
was
when
that
mother
stooped
to
learn
the
language
written
in
your
infant
face
for
years
she

the

i

a
naughty
day
i
scrunched
a
biscuit
in
my
hair
and
dipped
my
feeder
in
the
milk
and
spread
my
rusk
upon
a
chair
when
mother
put
me
in
my
bath
i
tossed
the
water
all
about
and
popped
the
soap
upon
my
head
and
threw
the
sponge
and
flannel
out
i
would
let
her
put
my
hand
inside
the
of
my
vest
i
held
the
sleeve
until
she
said
i
really
never
should
be
dressed
and
while
she
made
the
beds
i
found
her
tidy
and
took
out
the
hairs
and
then
i
got
the
and
tipped
it
headlong
down
the
stairs
i
crawled
along
the
kitchen
floor
and
got
some
coal
out
of
the
box
and
drew
black
pictures
on
the
walls
and
wiped
my
fingers
on
my
socks
oh
this
has
been
a
naughty
day
that
why
they
put
me
off
to
bed
he
ca
get
into
mischief
there
perhaps
we
have
some
peace
they
said
they
put
the
net
across
my
cot
or
else
downstairs
again
i
creep
but
see
i
suck
the
counterpane
to
pulp
before
i
go
to
sleep
to
a
little
white
bird
into
the
world
you
came
and
i
was
dumb
because
god
did
it
so
the
wise
ones
said
i
wonder
sometimes
did
you
really
come
and
are
you
truly
dead
thus
you
went
out
alone
and
uncaressed
o
sweet
soft
thing
in
all
your
infant
grace
i
never
held
you
in
my
arms
nor
pressed
warm
kisses
on
your
face
but
in
the
garden
of
the
undefiled
my
soul
will
claim
you
you
and
not
another
i
shall
hold
out
my
arms
and
say
my
child
and
you
will
call
me
mother
because
psalm
cxvi
because
he
heard
my
voice
and
answered
me
because
he
listened
ah
so
patiently
in
those
dark
days
when
sorrowful
alone
i
knelt
with
tears
and
prayed
him
for
a
stone
because
he
said
me
nay
and
then
stead
oh
wonderful
sweet
truth
he
gave
me
bread
set
my
heart
singing
all
in
sweet
accord
because
of
this
i
love
i
love
the
lord
when
he
comes
when
he
comes
my
sweetest
rossetti
thus
may
it
be
i
thought
at
some
day
close
some
eve
when
every
rose
breathes
forth
its
incense
may
he
find
me
there
in
holy
leisure
lifting
hands
of
prayer
in
some
sweet
garden
place
to
catch
the
first
dear
wonder
of
his
face
or
in
my
room
above
in
silent
meditation
of
his
love
my
soul
illumined
with
a
rapture
rare
it
would
be
sweet
if
even
then
these
eyes
might
glimpse
him
coming
in
the
ern
skies
and
be
caught
up
to
meet
him
in
the
air
but
now
ah
now
the
days
rush
by
their
hurrying
ways
no
longer
know
i
vague
imaginings
for
every
hour
has
wings
yet
my
heart
watches
as
i
work
i
say
all
simply
to
him
come
and
if
then
wilt
thou
find
me
thus
just
as
i
am
tending
my
household
stirring
berry
jam
or
swiftly
rinsing
tiny
vests
and
hose
with
puzzled
forehead
patching
some
clothes
guiding
small
footsteps
swift
to
hear
and
run
from
early
dawn
till
setting
of
the
sun
and
he
comes
i
rise
and
go
yes
all
the
gladlier
that
he
found
me
so
part
ii
out
of
doors
early
spring
quick
through
the
gates
of
fairyland
the
south
wind
forced
his
way
was
his
to
make
the
earth
forget
her
grief
of
yesterday
is
mine
cried
he
to
bring
her
joy
and
on
his
lightsome
feet
in
haste
he
slung
the
snowdrop
bells
pushed
past
the
fairy
sentinels
and
out
with
laughter
sweet
clear
flames
of
crocus
glimmered
on
the
shining
way
he
went
he
whispered
to
the
trees
strange
tales
of
wondrous
sweet
intent
when
suddenly
his
witching
voice
with
timbre
rich
and
rare
rang
through
the
woodlands
till
it
cleft
earth
silent
solitudes
and
left
a
dream
of
roses
there
the
witness
the
master
of
the
garden
said
who
now
the
earth
seems
cold
and
dead
will
by
his
fearless
witnessing
hold
men
hearts
for
the
tardy
spring
not
yet
i
am
but
half
awake
all
drowsily
the
primrose
spake
and
fast
the
sleeping
daffodils
had
folded
up
their
golden
frills
indeed
the
frail
anemone
said
softly
is
too
cold
for
me
wood
hyacinths
all
deeply
set
replied
no
ice
has
melted
yet
when
suddenly
with
smile
so
bright
up
sprang
a
winter
aconite
and
to
the
master
joyfully
she
cried
i
will
the
witness
be
in
somerset
in
somerset
they
guide
the
plough
from
early
dawn
till
twilight
now
the
good
red
earth
smells
sweeter
yet
behind
the
plough
in
somerset
the
celandines
round
last
year
mow
blaze
out
and
with
his
vow
the
south
wind
woos
the
violet
in
somerset
then
every
brimming
dyke
and
trough
is
laughing
wide
with
ripples
now
and
oh
is
easy
to
forget
that
wintry
winds
can
sigh
and
sough
when
thrushes
chant
on
every
bough
in
somerset
song
of
a
woodland
stream
silent
was
i
and
so
still
as
day
followed
day
imprisoned
until
king
frost
worked
his
will
held
fast
like
a
vice
in
his
cold
hand
of
ice
for
fear
kept
me
silent
and
lo
he
had
wrapped
me
around
and
about
with
a
mantle
of
snow
but
sudden
there
spake
one
greater
than
he
then
my
heart
was
awake
and
my
spirit
ran
free
at
his
bidding
my
bands
fell
apart
he
had
burst
them
asunder
i
can
feel
the
swift
wind
rushing
by
me
once
more
the
old
wonder
of
quickening
sap
stirs
my
pulses
i
shout
in
my
gladness
forgetting
the
sadness
for
the
voice
of
the
lord
fills
the
air
and
forth
through
the
hollow
i
go
where
in
glad
april
weather
the
trees
of
the
forest
break
out
into
singing
together
and
here
the
frail
windflowers
will
cluster
with
young
ferns
uncurling
where
broader
and
deeper
my
waters
go
eddying
whirling
to
meet
the
sweet
spring
on
her
journey
his
servant
to
be
whose
word
set
me
free
luggage
in
advance
the
fairies
must
have
come
i
said
for
through
the
moist
leaves
brown
and
dead
the
primroses
are
pushing
up
and
here
a
scarlet
they
must
have
come
because
i
see
a
single
wood
anemone
the
flower
that
everybody
knows
the
fairies
use
to
scent
their
clothes
and
hark
the
south
wind
blowing
fills
the
trumpets
of
the
daffodils
they
must
have
come
then
loud
to
me
sang
from
a
budding
cherry
tree
a
cheerful
thrush
i
say
i
say
the
fairy
folk
are
on
their
way
look
out
look
out
beneath
your
feet
are
all
their
treasures
sweet
sweet
sweet
they
could
not
carry
them
you
see
those
caskets
crammed
with
witchery
so
ready
for
the
first
spring
dance
they
sent
their
luggage
in
advance
at
the
cross
roads
there
i
halted
further
down
the
hollow
stood
the
township
where
my
errand
lay
firm
my
purpose
till
a
voice
cried

rioting
this
hour
though
i
am
far
away
where
all
the
glad
are
old
loves
of
long
ago
and
each
in
its
accustomed
place
is
blossoming
the
lilac
drops
her
amethysts
upon
the
mossy
wall
while
in
her
boughs
a
cheerful
thrush
is
calling
to
his
mate

breath
of
mignonette
and
stocks
i
love

fragrant
spices
from

by
the
gate

from
the
west
country
wet
wind
but
scented
so
that
straight
from
my
dear
garden
you
seem
but
lately
come
just
tell
me
of
the
yellow
broom
the
guelder
rose
snow
and
of
the
tangled
clematis
where
myriad
insects
hum
oh
is
there
any
heartsease
left
or
any
rosemary
and
in
their
own
green
solitudes
say
do
the
lilies
wait
i
knew
it
gentle
wind
but
once
speak
low
and
tenderly
how
fares
it
tell
me
truly
with
the
lad
love
by
the
gate
the
thrush
across
the
land
came
a
magic
word
when
the
earth
was
bare
and
lonely
and
i
sit
and
sing
of
the
joyous
spring
for
was
i
who
heard
i
only
then
dreams
came
by
of
the
gladsome
days
of
many
a
wayside
posy
for
a
crocus
peeps
where
the
wild
rose
sleeps
and
the
willow
wands
are
rosy
oh
the
time
to
be
when
the
paths
are
green
when
the
is
lying
the
hazel
spray
where
the
catkins
sway
and
the
dear
south
wind
comes
ing
my
mate
and
i
we
shall
build
a
nest
so
snug
and
warm
and
cosy
when
the
kingcups
gleam
on
the
meadow
stream
where
the
willow
wands
are
rosy
in
dorset
dear
in
dorset
dear
they
making
hay
in
just
the
old
west
country
way
with
fork
and
rake
and
gear
they
make
the
hay
in
dorset
dear
from
early
morn
till
twilight
grey
they
toss
and
turn
and
shake
the
hay
and
all
the
countryside
is
gay
with
roses
on
the
fallen
may
for
is
the
of
the
year
in
dorset
dear
the
loaded
waggons
wend
their
way
across
the
and
stay
beside
the
hedge
where
foxgloves
peer
and
ricks
that
shall
be
fashioned
here
will
be
the
sweetest
stuff
they
say
in
dorset
dear
the
flight
of
the
fairies
there
a
rustle
in
the
woodlands
and
a
sighing
in
the
breeze
for
the
little
folk
are
busy
in
the
bushes
and
the
trees
they
are
packing
up
their
treasures
every
one
with
nimble
hand
ready
for
the
coming
journey
back
to
sunny
fairyland
they
have
gathered
up
the
jewels
from
their
beds
of
mossy
green
with
all
the
dewy
diamonds
that
summer
morns
have
seen
the
silver
from
the
lichen
and
the
powdered
gold
dust
too
where
the
buttercups
have
flourished
and
the
dandelions
grew
they
packed
away
the
birdies
songs
then
lest
we
should
be
sad
they
left
the
robin
carol
out
to
make
the
winter
glad
they
packed
the
fragrance
of
the
flowers
then
lest
we
should
forget
out
of
the
pearly
scented
box
they
dropped
a
violet
then
a
leafy
carpet
by
the
silent
woods
they
came
where
the
golden
bracken
lingered
and
the
maples
were
aflame
on
the
stream
the
starlight
shimmered
their
wings
the
moonbeams
shone
music
filtered
through
the
forest
and
the
little
folk
were
gone
the
street
player
the
shopping
had
been
tedious
and
the
rain
came
pelting
down
as
she
turned
home
again
the
swirled
past
with
rush
and
whirr
nought
but
its
fumes
of
petrol
left
for
her
the
bloaters
in
her
basket
and
the
cheese
malodorously
mixed
themselves
with
these
and
all
seemed
wrong
the
world
was
drab
and
grey
as
the
slow
minutes
wept
themselves
away
and
then
athwart
the
noises
of
the
street
a
violin
flung
out
an
irish
air
i
take
you
home
again
kathleen
ah
sweet
how
those
lilting
phrases
were
they
soothed
away
the
weariness
and
brought
such
peace
to
one
worn
woman
wrought
that
she
forgot
the
things
which
vexed
her
so
the
too
outrageous
price
of
calico
the
look
of
pitying
insolence
because
she
paused
to
count
the
dwindling
pence
the
player
stopped
but
the
rapt
vision
stayed
that
woman
faced
life
worries
unafraid
the
sugar
shortage
now
had
ceased
to
be
an
insurmountable
calamity
her
kingdom
was
not
bacon
no
nor
butter
but
things
more
costly
still
too
rare
to
utter
and
over
so
bare
and
tall
the
sun
set
gloriously
after
all
on
all
souls
eve
oh
the
garden
ways
are
lonely
winds
that
bluster
winds
that
shout
battle
with
the
strong
laburnum
toss
the
sad
brown
leaves
about
in
the
gay
herbaceous
border
now
a
scene
of
wild
disorder
the
last
dear
hollyhock
has
flamed
his
crimson
glory
out
yet
upon
this
night
of
longing
souls
are
all
abroad
they
say
will
they
come
the
dazzling
blossoms
that
were
here
but
yesterday
will
the
ghosts
of
radiant
roses
and
my
sheltered
hold
once
more
their
shattered
fragrance
now
november
on
her
way
wallflowers
surely
you
remember
pinks
recall
it
will
you
not
how
i
loved
and
watched
and
tended
made
this
ground
a
hallowed
spot
pansies
with
the
soft
meek
faces
harebells
with
a
thousand
graces
dear
dead
loves
i
wait
and
listen
tell
me
have
you
quite
forgot
hush
they
come
for
down
the
way
steals
a
fragrance
larkspurs
lilies
stocks
and
roses
hasten
now
my
heart
to
greet
stay
oh
stay
my
hands
would
hold
you
but
the
arms
that
would
enfold
you
crush
the
bush
of
lad
love
growing
in
the
dusk
beside
my
feet
the
log
fire
in
her
last
hour
of
life
the
tree
gave
up
her
glorious
memories
wild
scent
of
wood
anemone
the
sapphire
blue
of
april
skies
with
faint
but
flame
the
hyacinthine
spires
were
lost
as
bracken
came
with
maple
bathed
in
living
fires
grey
smoke
of
ancient
clematis
towards
the
silver
birch
inclined
and
deep
in
thorny
fastnesses
the
coral
bryony
entwined
then
softly
through
the
dusky
room
they
strayed
fair
ghosts
of
other
days
with
breath
like
early
cherry
bloom
with
tender
eyes
and
gentle
ways
they
glimmered
on
the
sombre
walls
they
danced
upon
the
oaken
floor
till
through
the
loudly
silent
halls
joy
reigned
majestical
once
more
up
blazed
the
fire
and
dazzling
clear
one
rapturous
spirit
radiant
stood
was
you
at
last
yes
you
my
dear
we
two
were
back
in
gatcombe
wood
god
save
the
king
god
save
our
gracious
king
it
seems
the
church
is
full
of
bygone
dreams
long
live
our
noble
king
my
own
is
hard
to
stand
here
all
alone
god
save
the
king
but
sweetheart

were
always
brave
to
dare
and
do
send
him
victorious
for
then
my
darling
will
come
home
again
happy
and
glorious
be
like
heaven
to
him
and
what
to
me
long
to
reign
over
us
my
dear
and
we
been
wedded
one
short
year
god
save
our
king
and
lord
i
pray
keep
my
king
safe
this
very
day
forgive
us
thou
great
england
kingly
king
that
thus
do
women
national
anthems
sing
