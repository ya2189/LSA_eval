preface
with

i
offer
up
these
rhymes
of
mine
to
children
of
maturer
years
from
seventeen
to
a
special
solace
may
they
be
in
days
of
second
infancy
the
frenzied
mother
who
observes
this
volume
in
her
offspring
hand
and
trembles
for
the
darling
nerves
must
please
to
clearly
understand
if
baby
suffers
by
and
by
the
publisher
at
fault
not
but
should
the
little
brat
survive
and
fatten
on
this
style
of
rhyme
to
raise
a
heartless
home
and
thrive
through
a
successful
life
of
crime
the
publisher
would
have
you
see
that
am
to
be
thanked
not
fond
parent
you
whose
children
are
of
tender
age
from
two
to
eight
pray
keep
this
little
volume
far
from
reach
of
such
and
relegate
my
verses
to
an
upper
shelf
where
you
may
study
them
yourself
foreword
the
press
may
pass
my
verses
by
with
sentiments
of
indignation
and
say
like
greeks
of
old
that
i
corrupt
the
youthful
generation
i
am
unmoved
by
taunts
like
these
and
so
i
think
was
socrates
the
critics
may
revile
i
pick
no
journalistic
quarrels
quite
realising
that
my
style
makes
up
for
any
lack
of
morals
for
which
i
feel
no
shred
of
shame
and
byron
would
have
felt
the
same
i
do
intend
a
child
to
read
these
lines
which
are
not
for
the
young
for
if
i
did
i
should
indeed
feel
fully
worthy
to
be
hung
is
the
perfect
tense
of
correct
me
andrew
lang
o
young
of
heart
tho
in
your
prime
by
you
these
verses
may
be
seen
accept
the
moral
with
the
rhyme
and
try
to
gather
what
i
mean
but
if
you
ca
it
wo
hurt
me
and
browning
would
i
know
agree
be
reassured
i
have
not
got
the
style
of
stephen
phillips
heroes
nor
henry
jones
of
plot
nor
wit
like
arthur
wing
pinero
if
so
i
should
not
waste
my
time
in
writing
you
this
sort
of
rhyme
i
strive
to
paint
things
as
they
are
of
realism
the
true
apostle
all
metaphors
i
bar
nor
call
the
homely
thrush
a
such
synonyms
would
make
me
smile
and
so
they
would
have
made
carlyle
my
style
may
be
at
times
i
own
a
trifle
cryptic
or
abstruse
in
this
i
do
not
stand
alone
and
need
but
mention
in
excuse
a
thousand
names
from
meredith
to
henry
james
from
these
my
fruitless
fancy
roams
to
aesop

la

from
doyle
or
hemans

table

wish
in

were
as
the
wit
of

had

but
whitman
rugged
skill
and
managed
to
escape
the
censor
the
accuracy
of
a

i
might
find
it
most

i
but

hard
the
public
vanquished
by

acclaim
me
as
a

bard
like

listen

light
as

love

so
do
ignore
me
if
you
should
touch
me
to
the
very

oh
to
be
as
much
misunderstood
as
once
was
andrea
del

skyscraping

vast
hotels

rest
on

tall
with

all

the
british
are
a
chilly

the
briton
thinks
himself
by
birth
to
be
the
lord
of
all
the
earth
some
call
his
manners
wanting
or
his
sense
of
humour
poor
and
yet
whatever
he
is
striving
for
he
as
a
rule
contrives
to
get
his
methods
may
be
much
to
blame
but
he
arrives
there
just
the

if
you
can
get
your
wish
you
bet
it
does

iv
scotland
in
scotland
all
the
people
wear
red
hair
and
freckles
and
one
sees
the
men
in
women
dresses

with
stout

know
which
they
like
the
most
they
are
the
least
afraid
of
work
no
sense
of
humour
can
they
boast
and
you
require
an
axe
to
coax
the
canny
scot
to
see
your
jokes
they
play
an
instrument
they
call
the
bagpipes
and
the
sound
of
these
is
reminiscent
of
the
squall
of
infant
pigs
attacked
by
bees
music
that
might
drive
cats
away
or
make
reluctant
chickens
lay
wear
kilts
and
tho
men
look
askance
go
out

give
your

a
chance
v
ireland
the
irishman
is
never
quite
contented
with
his
little
lot
he
ever
thirsting
for
a
fight
a
grievance
he
has
always
got
and
all
his
energy
is
bent
on
trying
not
to
pay
his
rent
he
lives
upon
a
frugal
fare
the
few
potatoes
that
he
digs
and
hospitably
loves
to
share
his
bedroom
with
his
wife
and
pigs
but
can
not
settle
even
here
and
gets
evicted
once
a
year
in
order
to
amuse
himself
at
any
time
when
things
are
slack
he
takes
his
gun
down
from
the
shelf
and
shoots
a
landlord
in
the
back
if
he
is
lucky
in
the
chase
he
may
contrive
to
bag
a
brace
procure
a
grievance
and
a
gun
and
you
can
have
no
end
of
fun
vi
wales
the
natives
of
the
land
of
wales
are
not
a
very
truthful
lot
and
the
imagination
fails
to
paint
the
language
they
have
got
if
you
talk
then
do
it
pray
in
an
intelligible
way
vii
china
the
chinaman
from
early
youth
is
by
his
wise
preceptors
taught
to
have
no
dealings
with
the
truth
in
fact
romancing
is
his
in
juggling
words
he
takes
the
prize
by
the
sheer
beauty
of
his
lies
for
laundrywork
he
has
a
knack
he
takes
in
shirts
and
makes
them
blue
when
he
omits
to
send
them
back
he
takes
his
customers
in
too
he
must
be
ranked
in
the
of
those
whose
hobby
is
deceit
for
ladies
is
the
fashion
here
to
pinch
their
feet
and
make
them
small
which
to
the
civilised
idea
is
not
a
proper
thing
at
all
our
modern
western
woman
taste
in
pinching
leans
towards
the
waist
the
chinese
empire
is
the
field
where
foreign
missionaries
go
a
poor
result
their
labours
yield
and
they
have
little
fruit
to
show
for
if
you
would
convert
wun
lung
you
have
to
catch
him
very
young
the
chinaman
has
got
a
creed
and
a
religion
of
his
own
and
would
be
much
obliged
indeed
if
you
could
leave
his
soul
alone
and
he
prefers
which
may
seem
odd
his
own
to
other
people
god
yet
still
the
missionary
tries
to
point
him
out
his
wickedness
until
the
badgered
natives
rise
and
there
one
missionary
less
then
foreign
step
in
you
see
and
ask
for
an
indemnity
adhere
to
facts
avoid
romance
and
you
a
clergyman
may
be
to
lie
is
wrong
except
perchance
in
matters
of
diplomacy
and
when
you
start
out
to
convert
make
certain
that
you
do
get
hurt
viii
france
the
natives
here
remark
dieu
ça
va
par
exemple
un
peu
donc
mais
que
que
ça
they
shave
one
portion
of
their
dogs
and
live
exclusively
on
frogs
they
get
excited
very
quick
and
crowds
will
gather
before
long
if
you
should
stand
and
wave
your
stick
and
shout
bas
le
presidong
still
more
amusing
would
it
be
to
say
la
patrie
the
french
are
so
polite
you
know
they
take
their
hats
off
very
well
and
should
they
tread
upon
your
toe
remark
mademoiselle
and
you
would
gladly
bear
the
pain
to
see
them
make
that
bow
again
their
ladies
too
have
got
a
way
which
even
curates
ca
resist
make
an
alderman
feel
gay
or
soothe
a
yellow
journalist
and
then
the
things
they
say
are
so
extremely
well
in
fact
you
know
the
closest
scrutiny
can
find
no
morals
here
of
any
kind
ix
germany
the
german
is
a
stolid
soul
and
finds
best
suited
to
his
taste
a
pipe
with
an
enormous
bowl
a
fraulein
with
an
ample
waist
he
loves
his
beer
his
kaiser
and
donner
und
blitz
his
fatherland
he
perfectly
contented
if
he
listens
in
the
to
wagner
or
waltzes
of
the
nimble
strauss
and
all
discordant
bands
he
sends
abroad
to
soothe
his
foreign
friends
when
he
is
glad
at
anything
he
cheers
like
a
dyspeptic
goat
hoch

from
some
affection

this
country
is
extremely
flat
just

your
father
head
and
were
it
not
for

would
not

country
there

if
these

should
broken
be

now

soon
be

so
any
child
who
glory
seeks
and
in
a
dyke
observes
a
hole
must
hold
his
finger
there
for
weeks
and
keep
the
water
from
its
goal

the
local
plumbers
come

other
persons

the

his

of

he
evidently

he

of
being

enables
him
with
ease

nobody

the

have

that

if
you

is
best
to

may

in

good

you
will

an
alluring
person
who
has
got
a
bright

flashing

knows
just
how
to
use
it
too
it
quite
a
treat
to
see

the
proud
hidalgo
on
the
street
he
wears
a
sort
of
soft
felt
hat
a
dagger
and
a
cloak
you
know
just
like
the
wicked
villains
that
we
met
in
plays
of
long
ago
who
sneaked
about
with
aspect
glum
remarking
a
time
will
come
his
blood
of
blue
cerulean
hue
runs
in
his
veins
like
liquid
fire
and
he
can
be
most
rude
if
you
should
rob
him
of
his
heart
desire
he
exclaims
and
whack
his
dagger
perforates
your
back
if
you
should
care
to
patronise

you

no
doubt
you
see
a
horse
with
blinded
eyes
be
very
badly
mauled
about
by
such
a
scene
a
weak
inside
is
sometimes
rather
sorely
tried
and
if
the
bull
is
full
of
fun
the
horse
is
generally
gored
so
then
they
fetch
another
one
or
else
the
first
one
is
encored
the
humour
of
the
sport
of
course
is
not
so
patent
to
the
horse
be
kind
to
bull
you
meet
remember
how
the
creature
feels

wink
at
ladies
in

do
make

to

of
the
heart
in
which
case
swarming
up
the

brings
on
a
bad
attack
of

the
nicest
method
is
to
stay
quite
comfortably
down

from

watch

turkey
the
sultan
of
the
purple
east
is
quite
a
cynic
in
his
way
and
really
does
mind
the
least
his
nickname
of
the
nay
i
might
perhaps
come
in
for
blame
if
i
divulged
this
monarch
name
the
turk
is
such
a
kindly
man
but
his
ideas
of
sport
are
crude
he
to
the
poor
armenian
is
not
intentionally
rude
but
still
it
is
his
heartless
habit
to
treat
him
as
treat
the
rabbit
if
he
wants
bracing
up
a
bit
his
pleasing
little
custom
is
to
take
a
hatchet
and
commit
a
series
of
atrocities
i
should
not
fancy
after
dark
to
meet
him
say
in
regent
park
a
deeply
married
man
is
he
and
often
is
his
rule
he
practises
polygamy
directly
after
leaving
school
and
so
arranges
that
his
wives
live
happy
but
secluded
lives
if
they
attend
a
public
place
they
have
to
do
so
in
disguise
and
so
conceal
their
face
that
nothing
but
a
pair
of
eyes
suggests
the
hidden
charm
that
lurks
beneath
the
veils
of
lady
turks
then
too
in
turkey
all
the
men
smoke
and
cross
their
legs
they
watch
their
harem
as
a
hen
that
guards
her
first
attempt
at
eggs
if
you
do
know
what
harems
are
just
run
and
ask
your
dear
papa
wives
of
great
men
oft
remind
us
we
should
make
our
wives
sublime

the
years
advancing
find
us
vainly
working

here
you
will
see
strange
happenings
with
absolutely
placid
eyes
if
all
your
uncles
sprouted
wings
you
would
not
feel
the
least
surprise
the
oddest
things
that
you
can
do
do
seem
a
bit
absurd
to
you
you
go
in
dreamland
to
a
ball
and
suddenly
are
shocked
to
find
that
you
have
nothing
on
at
all
but
somehow
no
one
seems
to
mind
and
naturally
do
care
if
they
can
bear
what
you
can
bare
then
in
a
moment
you
pursued
by
engines
on
a
railway
track
your
legs
are
tied
your
feet
are
glued
the
train
comes
snorting
down
your
back
one
last
attempt
at
flight
you
make
and
so
in
bed
perspiring
wake
you
feel
so
free
from
weight
of
cares
that
if
the
staircase
you
should
climb
you
gaily
mount
not
single
stairs
but
whole
battalions
at

mixed
may
be
i
quote
from
shakespeare
as
you
see
if
you
should
eat
too
much
you
pay
in
dreams
the
penalty
for
this
a
nightmare
carries
you
away
and
drops
you
down
a
precipice
down
down
until
with
sudden
smack
you
strike
the
mattress
with
your
back
at
meals
decline
to
be

loverland
this
is
the
land
where
minor
bards
and
other
lunatics
repair
to
live
in
houses
made
of
cards
or
build
their
castles
in
the
air
to
feed
on
hope
and
idly
dream
that
things
are
really
what
they
seem
the
natives
are
a
motley
lot
of
age
and
creed
and
race
but
each
inhabitant
has
got
the
same
expression
on
his
face
they
look
when
this
their
features
fills
like
angels
with
internal
chills
the
lover
sits
the
livelong
day
quite
inarticulate
of
speech
he
simply
brims
with
things
to
say
alas
the
words
he
can
not
reach
and
silent
lets
occasion
pass
feeling
a
fulminating
ass
it
is
the
lady
lover
wont
to
blush
and
look
demure
or
coy
to
say
must
and
do
or
leave
off
you
naughty
boy
but
this
of
course
is
just
her
way
she
would
wish
you
to
obey
the
lover
in
a
trembling
voice
demands
the
hand
of
his
lovee
and
begs
the
lady
of
his
choice
to
share
some
with
a
prison
would
be
nice
a
a
paradise
in
a
cottage
sounds
so
well
but
oh
my
too
impatient
bride
no
drainage
and
a
constant
smell
of
something
being
is
not
the
sort
of
atmosphere
that
makes
for
wedded
bliss
my
dear
and
when
the
bills
are
rather
high
and
when
the
money
rather
low
see
poor
virginia
sit
and
sigh
and
ask
why
paul
grumble
so
he
slams
the
door
and
strides
about
and
through
the
window
love
creeps
out
is
said
that
cupid
blinds
our
sight
with
fire
of
passion
from
above
nor
ever
bids
us
see
aright
the
many
faults
in
those
we
love
ah
no
i
deem
it
otherwise
for
lovers
have
the
clearest
eyes
they
see
the
faults
the
failures
and
the
great
temptations
and
they
know
although
they
can
not
understand
that
they
would
have
the
loved
one
so
believe
me
love
is
never
blind
his
smiling
eyes
are
wise
and
kind
tho
lovers
quarrel
yet
i
ween
is
but
to
make
it
up
again
the
sunshine
seems
the
more
serene
that
follows
after
april
rain
and
love
should
lead
if
love
be
true
to
perfect
understanding
too
if
in
our
hearts
this
love
beats
strong
we
shall
not
ever
seek
to
earn
forgiveness
for
some
fancied
wrong
nor
need
to
pardon
in
return
but
learn
this
lesson
as
we
live
understand
is
to
forgive
and
all
you
little

find
this
out
yourselves
some

then
i

that
you
tread
the
paths
of

do
fall
in

when
you
do

to
tell
us

where
relatives
with

can
penetrate

all
our

ruthless

prelude
way
of
i
have
no
knowledge
of

no
notion
what
may
be
since
housemaid
throat
and
smoker
knees
mean
something
different
to
me
to
what
they
do
to
other
folk
this
is
i
vow
no
vulgar
joke
of
course
when
young
i
had
complaints
and
little
childish
accidents
for
twice
i
ate
a
box
of
paints
and
once
i
swallowed
eighteen
pence
i
missed
the
paints
a
lot
but
got
the
coins
back
on
the
spot
but
no
practitioner
has
seen
my
tongue
since
then
down
to
the
present
and
i
alas
have
never
been
an
interesting
convalescent
ah
why
am
i
alone
denied
the
humour
of
a
weak
inside
why
is
it
i
will
tell
you
why
a
certain
mixture
is
to
blame
one
day
for
fun
i
chanced
to
try
a
bottle
of
what
the
name
that
thing
they
advertise
a
lot
oh
what
a
memory
i
got
it
stuff
you
must
of
course
have
seen
retailed
in
bottles
tins
or
pots
in
cakes
or
little
pills
i
mean
oh
goodness
me
i
bought
such
lots
that
i
am
really
much
to
blame
for
not
remembering
the
name
still
let
me
recommend
a
keg
with
maker
name
be
sure
above
it
is
sweeter
than
a
egg
and
village
idiots
simply
love
it
old
persons
sit
and
scream
for
it
i
do
so
hope
you
try
a
bit
so
efficacious
is
this
stuff
its
virtue
and
its
strength
are
such
one
single
bottle
is
enough
in
fact
at
times
is
far
too
much
the
patient
dies
in
frightful
pain
or
else
survives
and
tries
again
an
aunt
of
mine
felt
anyhow
all
and
had
freckles
badly
too
but
now
she
does
have
a
thing
but
fits
she
just
as
strong
as
any
horse
tho
still
an
invalid
of
course
i
had
an
uncle
too
that
way
his
health
was
in
a
dreadful
plight
would
often
spend
a
sleepless
day
and
lie
unconscious
half
the
night
he
took
two
bottles
large
and
small
and
now
he
has
no
health
at
all
the
moral
plainly
bids
you
buy
this
stuff
whose
name
i
have
forgotten
you
wo
regret
it
if
you
try
my
memory
is
simply
rotten

funds
will
profit

i
got
appendicitis
in

but
i
do
mind
because
i
find
i
quite
out

john
across

tried
to
navigate
a

he
met
an
unromantic
and
extremely
hungry
shark
john
i
blame
his
childhood
teachers
thought
to
treat
this
as
a
lark
ignorant
of
how
these
creatures
do
delight
to
bite
a
barque
said
animal
a
bore
and
with
a
scornful
sort
of
grin
handled
an
adjacent
oar
and
chucked
it
underneath
the
chin
at
this
unexpected
juncture
which
he
had
not
reckoned
on
shark
he
made
a
puncture
in
the
barque
and
then
in
sad
am
i
and
sore
at
thinking
john
had
on
some
clothes
of
mine
i
can
almost
see
them
shrinking
washed
repeatedly
in
brine
i
shall
never

regretting
that
i
lent
my
hat
to
him

i
fear
a
thorough
wetting

not
well
improve

to
know
a
shark
is
browsing
boldly
blandly
on
my
boots
coldly
cruelly
carousing
on
the
choicest
of
my
suits
creatures

with
loathing

its

ire
by

the

to

on

even
leave
the
fat
who
never
stays
in
bed
too
late

does
immoral
things
like
that
instead
of
saying
or
he
sit
and
wash
and
wash
and
wash
when
shadows
fall
and
lights
grow
dim
he
sits
beneath
the
kitchen
stair
regardless
as
to
life
and
limb
a
shady
lair
he
chooses
there
and
if
you
tumble
over
him
he
simply
loves
to
hear
you
swear

prefer

i
is
its
own
virtue
its
own
reward
alas
and
what
a
poor
one
as
a
rule
be
virtuous
and
life
will
pass
like
one
long
term
of
no
prospect
truly
could
one
find
more
unalluring
to
the
mind
the
model
child
has
got
to
keep
his
fingers
and
his
garments
white
in
church
he
may
not
go
to
sleep
nor
ask
to
stop
up
late
at
night
in
fact
he
must
not
ever
do
a
single
thing
he
wishes
to
he
may
not
paddle
in
his
boots
like
naughty
children
at
the
sea
the
sweetness
of
forbidden
fruits
is
not
alas
for
such
as
he
he
watches
with
pathetic
eyes
his
weaker
brethren
make
he
must
not
answer
back
oh
no
however
rude
may
be
but
keep
politely
silent
he
brim
with
scathing
repartee
for
nothing
is
considered
worse
than
scoring
off
mamma
or
nurse
he
must
not
eat
too
much
at
meals
nor
scatter
crumbs
upon
the
floor
however
vacuous
he
feels
he
may
not
pass
his
plate
for
more
not
tho
his
organ
ache
for
further
slabs
of
christmas
cake
he
is
commanded
not
to
waste
the
fleeting
hours
of
childhood
days
by
giving
way
to
any
taste
for
circuses
or
matinées
for
him
the
entertainments
planned
are
on
the
holy
land
he
never
reads
a
by
rider
or
winston
in
vain
upon
his
desk
you
look
for
tales
by
arthur
conan
nor
could
you
find
upon
his
shelf
the
works
of
rudyard
or
myself
he
always
fears
that
he
may
do
some
action
that
is
and
so
he
lives
his
short
life
through
in
the
most
noxious
rôle
of
prig
life
i
say
for
it
agreed
the
good
die
very
young
indeed
ah
me
how
sad
it
is
to
think
he
could
have
lived
like
me
or
you
with
practice
and
a
taste
for
drink
our
joys
he
might
have
known
he
too
and
shared
the
pleasure
have
had
in
being
gloriously
bad
the
naughty
boy
gets
much
delight
from
doing
what
he
should
not
do
but
as
such
conduct
is
right
he
sometimes
suffers
for
it
too
yet
what
a
spanking
to
the
fun
of
leaving
vital
things
undone
the
wicked
flourish
like
the
bay
at
cards
or
love
they
always
win
good
fortune
dogs
their
steps
all
day
they
fatten
while
the
good
grow
thin
the
righteous
man
has
much
to
bear
the
bad
becomes
a
bullionaire
for
though
he
be
the
greatest
sham
luck
favours
him
his
whole
life
through
at
he
always
makes
a
slam
after
declaring
atout
with
deal
his
fate
has
planned
a
hundred
aces
in
his
hand
yes
it
is
always
just
the
same
he
somehow
manages
to
win
by
mere
good
fortune
any
game
that
he
may
be
competing
in
at
golf
no
bunker
breaks
his
club
for
him
the
green
provides
no
at
billiards
too
he
flukes
away
with
quite
unnecessary
no
matter
what
he
tries
to
play
for
him
the
pockets
open
wide
he
never
finds
both
balls
in
baulk
or
makes
for
want
of
chalk
he
swears
he
very
likely
bets
he
even
wears
a
flaming
necktie
inhales
egyptian
cigarettes
and
has
a
inconscia
recti
yet
spite
of
all
one
must
confess
that
nought
succeeds
like
his
excess
there
no
occasion
to
be
just
no
need
for
motives
that
are
fine
to
be
director
of
a
trust
or
manager
of
a
combine
your
corner
is
a
public
curse
perhaps
but
it
will
fill
your
purse
then
stride
across
the
public
bones
crush
all
opponents
under
you
until
you
on
of
their
dead
selves
and
when
you
do
the
widow
and
the
orphan
tears
shall
comfort
your
declining
years
myself
how
lucky
i
must
be
that
need
not
fear
so
gross
an
end
since
fortune
has
not
favoured
me
with
many
million
pounds
to
spend
still
did
that
fickle
dame
relent
i
show
you
how
they
be
spent
i
am
not
saint
enough
to
feel
my
shoulder
ripen
to
a
wing
nor
have
i
wits
enough
to
steal
his
title
from
the
copper
king
and
there
a
vasty
gulf
between
the
man
i
am
and
might
have
been
but
tho
at
dinner
i
may
take
too
much
of
heidsick
extra
dry
and
underneath
the
table
make
my
simple
couch
just
where
i
lie
my
mode
of
roosting
on
the
floor
is
just
a
trick
and
nothing
more
and
when
not
wisely
but
too
well
my
thirst
i
have
contrived
to
quench
the
stories
i
am
apt
to
tell
may
be
perhaps
a
trifle
french
for
is
in
anecdote
no
doubt
that
what
bred
in
the
beaune
comes
out
it
does
not
render
me
unfit
to
give
advice
both
wise
and
right
because
i
do
not
follow
it
myself
as
closely
as
i
might
there
nothing
that
i
would
do
to
point
the
proper
road
to
and
this
i
sure
of
more
or
less
and
trust
that
you
will
all
agree
the
elements
of
happiness
consist
in
being
just
like
me
no
sinner
nor
a
saint
perhaps
but
well
the
very
best
of
chaps
share
the
experience
i
have
had
consider
all
i
known
and
seen
and
do
be
good
and
do
be
bad
but
cultivate
a
golden
what
makes
existence
nice
is
virtue
with
a
dash
of
vice
ii
is
as
good
as
a
what
is
enough
an
idle
dream
one
can
not
have
enough

swear
of
ices
or
nougat
or
chocolate
éclairs
of
oysters
or
of
caviar
of
prawns
or
pâté
de

who
would
not
willingly
forsake
kindred
and
home
without
a
fuss
for
icing
from
a
birthday
cake
or
juicy
fat
asparagus
and
journey
over
countless
seas
for
new
potatoes
and
green
peas
they
say
that
a
contented
mind
is
a
continual
feast
but
where
the
mental
frame
and
how
to
find
which
can
with
turtle
soup
compare
no

however
full
of
ease
could
be

a

with
the

will
do

simpler
type
a
homely
pint
of
an
onion
and
a
dish
of
tripe
or
headpiece
of
the
kindly
calf
cruel
perhaps
but
then
you
know
tout
souffrir
pour
être
is
a
mistake
to
eat
too
much
of
any
dishes
but
the
best
and
you
of
course
should
never
touch
a
thing

you

unscrupulous
pigmongers
will
attempt
to
wheedle
and
to
coax
the
ignorant
young
housewife
till
she
purchases
her
pigs
in
pokes
beasts
that
have
got
a
lurid
past
or
else
are
far
too
good
to

should
you

be
the
victim
of
a
cruel
hoax
then
promise
me
ah
promise
me
you
will
not

pigs
in
pokes
be
an
error
just
as
big
to
poke
your
purchase
in
a
pig
too
well
i
know
the
bitter
cost
to
turn
this
subject
off
with
jokes
how
many
fortunes
have
been
lost
by
men
who
purchased
pigs
in
pokes
ah
think
on
such
when
you
would
talk
with
mouths
that
are
replete
with
pork
and
after
dinner
round
the
fire
astride
of
grandpa
rugged
knee
implore
your
bored
but
patient
sire
to
tell
you
what
a
poke
may
be
the
fact
he
might
disclose
to
you
which
is
far
more
than
can
the
moral
of
the
pigs
and
pokes
is
not
to
make
your
choice
too
quick
in
purchasing
a
book
of
jokes
pray
poke
around
and
take
your
pick

to

to
me

instruction

to

things
easily
espeshly
other
people
things
and
time
will
make
your
fingers
deft
at
what
is
known
as
petty
theft
and
their
money
soon
must
part
and
you
can
help
this
on
may
be
if
in
the
kindness
of
your
heart
you
learn
to
take
things
easily
and
be
with
little
education
a
prince
of
misappropriation
v
rolling
stone
gathers
no
i
never
understood
i
own
what
anybody
with
a
soul
could
mean
by
offering
a
stone
this
needless
warning
not
to
roll
and
what
inducement
there
can
be
to
gather
moss
i
fail
to
see
i
sooner
gather
anything
like
primroses
or
news
perhaps
or
even
wool
when
suffering
a
momentary
mental
lapse
but
could
forgo
my
share
of
moss
nor
ever
realise
the
loss
is
a
botanical
disease
and
worthy
of
remark
as
such
lending
a
dignity
to
trees
to
ruins
a
romantic
touch
a
timely
adjunct
i
no
doubt
but
not
worth
writing
home
about
of
all
the
stones
i
ever
met
in
calm
repose
upon
the
ground
i
really
never
found
one
yet
with
a
desire
to
roll
around
theirs
is
a
stationary
rôle
a
joke
and
feeble
on
the
whole
but
if
i
were
a
stone
i
swear
i
sooner
move
and
view
the
world
than
sit
and
grow
the
greenest
hair
that
ever
nature
combed
and
curled
i
see
no
single
saving
grace
in
being
known
as
instead
i
might
prove
useful
for
a
weapon
in
the
hand
of
crime
a
paperweight
a
milestone
or
a
missile
at
in
each
capacity
i
could
do
quite
incalculable
good
when
well
directed
from
the
pit
i
might
promote
a
welcome
death
if
fortunate
enough
to
hit
some
budding
hamlet
or
macbeth
who
twice
each
day
the
playhouse
fills
for
further
notice
see
small
bills
at
concerts

you

in

then
human
stones
take
my
advice
as
you
should
always
do
indeed
this
proverb
may
be
very
nice
but
do
you
pay
it
any
heed
and
tho
you
make
the
critics
cross
roll
on
and
never
mind
the
moss
vi
is
never
too
late
to
since
it
can
never
be
too
late
to
change
your
life
or
else
renew
it
let
the
unpleasant
process
wait
until
you
are
to
do
it
the
state
provides
and
gratis
too
establishments
for
such
as
you
remember
this
and
pluck
up
heart
that
be
you
publican
or
parson
your
art
must
have
a
start
from
petty
larceny
to
arson
and
even
in
the
burglar
trade
the
cracksman
is
not
born
but
made
so
if
in
your
career
of
crime
you
fail
to
carry
out
some
then
try
again
a
second
time
and
yet
again
until
you
and
do
despair
or
fear
the
worst
because
you
get
found
out
at
first
perhaps
the
battle
will
not
go
on
all
occasions
to
the
strongest
you
may
be
fairly
certain
that
he
laughs
last
who
laughs
the
longest
so
keep
a
good
reserve
of
laughter
which
may
be
found
of
use
hereafter
believe
me
that
well
meant
a
good
resolve
is
always
brief
do
let
your
precious
hours
be
spent
in
turning
over
a
new
leaf
such
leaves
like
nature
soon
decay
and
then
are
only
in
the
way
the
road
to
well
a
certain
spot
a
road
of
very
fair
dimensions
has
so
the
proverb
tells
us
got
a
of
good
intentions
take
care
in
your
desire
to
please
you
do
not
add
a
brick
to
these
for
there
may
come
a
moment
when
you
shall
be
mended
with
many
more
misguided
men
whose
skill
is
undermined
with
skilly
till
then
procrastinate
my
friend

too
late
to

surely

you
read

ix

there
are
many
more
maxims
to
which
i
would
like
to
accord
a
front
place
but
alas
i
have
got
to
omit
a
whole
lot
for
the
lack
of
available
space
and
the
rest
i
am
forced
to
boil
down
and
condense
to
the
following
essence
of
sound
without
sense
now
the
pitcher
that
journeys
too
oft
to
the
well
will
get
broken
at
last
but
you
find
it
a
fact
that
by
using
some
tact
such
a
danger
as
this
can
be
past
there
an
obvious
way
and
a
simple
you
own
which
is
if
you
a
pitcher
to
let
well
alone
half
a
loafer
is
never
and
is
a
dangerous
thing
and
the
mice
are
at
play
when
the
cat
is
away
for
a
moment
inspecting
a
king
tho
if
care
kills
a
cat
as
the
proverbs
declare
it
is
right
to
suppose
that
the
king
will
take
care
do
halloo
till
you
out
of
the
wood
when
a
stitch
in
good
time
will
save
nine
while
a
bird
in
the
hand
is
worth
two
understand
in
the
bush
that
needs
no
good
wine
tho
the
two
if
they
sing
but
wo
have
been
known
by
an
accurate
aim
to
be
killed
with
one
stone
never
harness
the
cart
to
the
horse
since
the
latter
should
be
la
also
birds
of
a
feather
come
flocking
together
because
they
ca
well
flock
apart
you
may
cast
any
bread
on
the
waters
i
think
but
unless
i
mistaken
you
ca
make
it
sink
it
is
only
the
fool
who
remarks
that
there
ca
be
a
fire
without
smoke
has
he
never
yet
learned
how
the
gas
can
be
turned
on
the
best
incombustible
coke
would
you
value
a
man
by
the
checks
on
his
suits
and
forget
le
premier
passbook
qui
coutts
now
mortuis
nil
nisi
is
latin
as
one
owns
if
your
domicile
be
near
a
mortuaree
you
should
always
avoid
throwing
bones
i
would
further
remark
if
i
could
but
i
could
that
people
residing
in
glasshouses
should
you
have
heard
of
the
punctual
bird
who
was
first
in
presenting
his
bill
but
i
pray
you
be
firm
and
remember
the
worm
had
to
get
up
much
earlier
still
so
that
if
you
rise
in
the
morning
then
do
and
be
certain
that
where
there
a
will
there
a
wo
you
can
give
a
bad
name
to
a
dog
and
hang
him
by
way
of
excuse
whereas
hunger
of
course
is
by
far
the
best
sauce
for
the
gander
as
well
as
the
goose
but
you
should
judge
any
one
just
by
his
looks
for
a
surfeit
of
broth
ruins
too
many
cooks
with
the
fact
that
necessity
knows
nine
points
of
the
law
you
agree
there
are
just
as
good
fish
to
be
found
on
a
dish
as
you
ever
could
catch
in
the
sea
you
should
look
ere
you
leap
on
a
weasel
asleep
and
i
also
remarked
that
still
daughters
run
cheap
the
much
lane
turn
and
a
friend
is
in
need
of
a
friend
but
the
wisest
of
saws
like
the
camel
last
straws
or
the
longest
of
worms
have
an
end
so
before
out
of
patience
a
virtue
you
make
a
decisive
farewell
of
these
maxims
we
take
part
iv
bill
by
the
hospital
at
modder
where
i
met
fust

thought
as

it
a
fact
sez
as
the
doctors
took
out
brain
ho
well
wo
need
o
this
working
at
the
war
office
the
legend
of
the
author
long
way
after
when
anthony
adamson
first
went
to
school
the
reception
he
got
was
decidedly
cool
and
because
he
was
utterly
hopeless
at
games
he
was
given
all
sorts
of
opprobrious
names
which
ranged
the
whole
gamut
from
to
for
boys
as
a
rule
are
what
nurses
call
is
their
natural
instinct
which
nobody
blames
any
more
than
the
habits
peculiar
to
rabbits
to
label
a
duffer
woman
or
or
some
name
calculated
to
cause
him
to
suffer
they
failed
in
their
treatment
this
time
on
the
whole
since
our
anthony
thoroughly
pitied
the
rôle
of
the
oaf
who
is
muddied
for
kipling
he
studied
however
and
who
sits
in
a
goal
quite
deficient
of
soul
and
as
blind
to
the
beauties
of
life
as
a
mole
he
was
rather
a
curious
boy
was
this
youth
and
a
bit
of
a
prig
if
you
must
know
the
truth
and
his
comrades
considered
him
weird
and
uncouth
for
he
did
much
mind
when
they
left
him
behind
and
intent
upon
cricket
went
off
to
the
wicket
some
other
less
heating
employment
he
find
and
while
his
young
playfellows
fielded
and
batted
this
curious
would
take
a
new
pen
from
his
pocket
and
lick
it
then
into
the
thoughtfully
stick
it
and
chewing
the
holder
was
fashioned
of
gold
or
at
least
so
was
sold
by
a
stationer
bold
and
at
any
rate
furnished
a
good
imitation
in
deep
rumination
with
much
mastication
and
wonderful
patience
await
inspirations
and
brilliant
ideas
would
arrive
on
occasions
when
frequently
followed
the
pen
being
swallowed
as
up
to
his
eyes
in
the
inkpot
he
wallowed
so
all
the
day
long
and
for
half
of
the
night
would
young
anthony
adamson
nibble
and
write
with
extravagant
feelings
of
joy
and
delight
and
it
may
sound
absurd
but
was
thus
as
i
heard
that
he
learnt
to
acquire
the
appropriate
word
and
altho
composition
which
was
his
ambition
at
first
proved
a
trifle
untamed
and
refractory
arrived
in
a
while
at
evolving
a
style
which
a
stevenson
even
might
deem
satisfactory
now
when
anthony
was
as
yet
in
his
he
began
to
take
aim
at
the
big
magazines
with
articles
verses
and
little
and
short
stories
he
wrote
which
he
sent
with
a
note
which
i
have
the
space
nor
the
leisure
to
quote
containing
a
humble
request
and
a
hope
and
some
stamps
and
a
clearly
addressed
envelope
now
a
few
of
these
got
to
the
editor
desk
and
he
found
them
and
quite
picturesque
and
he
sighed
to
see
talent
like
this
go
to
waste
on
what
could
appeal
to
the
popular
taste
for
the
public
you
see
with
a
capital
p
does
care
what
it
reads
just
so
long
as
it
be
something
really
exciting
however
bad
writing
with
wonderful
heroes
and
villains
like
neroes
who
running
as
serials
wearing
imperials
revel
in
bloodshed
and
bombast
and
fighting
so
back
to
the
author
his
manuscript
went
altho
sometimes
a
friendly
old
editor
sent
an
encouraging
letter
to
say
he
do
better
to
lower
his
style
to
the
popular
level
when
anthony
proudly
of
course
not
out
loudly
but
mentally
told
him
to
go
to
the
devil
but
a
few
of
his
articles
never
came
back
and
their
whereabouts
no
one
was
able
to
track
for
some
persons
who
edited
can
it
be
credited
finding
it
paid
them
unduly
mislaid
them
behaviour
most
rare
nowadays
anywhere
and
to
tradition
entirely
opposed
and
grew
fat
on
the
numerous
stamps
he
enclosed
tho
to
this
i
am
really
unable
to
swear
or
at
any
rate
have
the
courage
to
dare
now
when
anthony
adamson
grew
rather
older
and
wiser
and
bolder
and
broader
of
shoulder
he
thought
he
a
fancy
to
write
for
the
press
is
a
common
idea
with
the
young
more
or
less
and
he
saw
himself
doing
critiques
and
reviewing
the
latest
new
books
as
they
came
from
the
printers
to
set
them
on
thrones
or
to
smash
them
to
splinters
to
damn
with
faint
praise
or
with
eulogies
raise
as
he
banned
or
he
blest
just
whatever
seemed
best
to
the
wit
and
the
wisdom
of
winters
but
when
he
had
carefully
read
thro
the
papers
arranged
to
the
taste
of
our
nation
of
drapers
and
wisely
as
solomon
studied
each
column
an
awful
attack
of
despair
and
depression
assailed
him
and
then
as
he
threw
down
his
pen
he
was
forced
to
confess
to
no
hope
of
success
if
he
entered
the
great
journalistic
profession
for
the
only
description
of
that
pays
in
the
journals
that
one
reads
nowadays
is
the
personal
matter
impertinent
chatter
the
tales
of
the
tailor
the
barber
the
hatter
society
small
talk
and
mere
talk
the
sort
of
and
those
who
can
handle
the
latest
big
scandal
with
the
taste
of
a
thug
and
the
tact
of
a
vandal
whatever
society
paper
they
write
in
can
always
provide
what
their
readers
delight
in
an
article
vulgarly
written
which
deals
with
the
food
that
celebrities
eat
at
their
meals
to
the
popular
intellect
always
appeals
people
laugh
themselves
hoarse
at
the
latest
divorce
while
a
peer
breach
of
promise
is
comic
of
course
how
eager
each
face
is
as
one
races
to
read
the
details
of
the
cruelty
cases
and
a
magistrate
pun
is
considered
good
fun
and
arouses
the
bench
of
reporters
from
torpor
when
it
at
the
expense
of
some
pauper
so
anthony
pondered
the
different
ways
of
attaining
and
gaining
the
popular
praise
and
selected
a
score
of
his
brightest
essays
just
enough
for
a
book
which
he
hopefully
took
to
some
publishers
thinking
perhaps
they
would
look
at
what
might
as
he
could
help
modestly
hinting
repay
the
expense
and
the
trouble
of
printing
now
the
publishers
all
were
extremely
polite
and
encouraging
quite
for
they
saw
he
could
write
but
the
answer
they
gave
him
was
always
the
same
are
not
so
they
said
the
least
bit
to
blame
and
your
style
is
so
good
be
it
well
understood
we
be
happy
to
publish
your
work
if
we
could
but
alas
all
the
people
who
know
are
agreed
this
is
not
what
the
public
demands
or
would
read
is
over
the
head
of
the
people
they
said
you
only
write
down
to
the
popular
level
once
more
he
replied
they
could
go
to
the
devil
the
result
to
our
author
was
not
unexpected
and
as
on
his
failures
he
sadly
reflected
he
took
out
his
pen
and
a
nib
he
selected
then
wrote
and
his
verses
were
studded
with
curses
this
poem
the
lay
of
the
author
rejected
rejected
author
cup
comes
from
out
a
bitter
bin
constable
wo

interviewed
each
alas
in

looks
black
de

is

is
far
too
hard
to
humble
as
a
vassal
he
is
feeling
low
as
well
sadly
waits
without
the
cassell
vainly
tries
to
press
the
hourly
growing
leaner
finds
each

his
jokes

asks
the
longman
if
he

or
spottiswoode
to

each

each

partial

and
the
elliot
will

for
little

yet
that
little
long
he
want
when
the
lane
has
got
no
turning
and
the
richards
will
not
now
when
anthony
life
it
grew
harder
and
harder
less
coal
in
the
cellar
less
meat
in
the
larder
he
thought
for
a
while
and
at
last
with
a
smile
he
determined
to
sacrifice
even
his
style
so
he
wrote
just
whatever
came
into
his
head
without
any
regard
for
the
living
or
dead
or
for
what
his
friends
thought
or
his
enemies
said
from
his
style
he
effaced
as
incentives
to
waste
all
the
canons
of
grammar
and
even
good
taste
and
so
book
after
book
after
book
he
brought
out
which
you
probably
read
and
you
know
all
about
for
the
publishers
bought
them
and
one
thought
them
so
splendidly
vulgar
that
no
one
had
ever
read
anything
quite
so
improperly
clever
he
tried
style
from
the
fashion
of
his
characters
being
society
leaders
the
heroine
suited
to
readers
a
governess
she
who
might
well
have
been
humbler
the
hero
a
duke
an
inveterate
grumbler
and
a
guardsman
who
drank
from
a
tumbler
to
that
of
another
more
popular
lady
and
wrote
about
aristocrats
who
were
shady
and
showed
that
the
persons
you
happen
to
meet
in
the
very
best
houses
are
always
effete
that
they
gamble
all
night
in
particular
sets
and
oh
has
she
said
it
tho
can
it
be
ed
have
no
intention
of
paying
their
debts
his
best
which
the
critics
said
with
expression
was
the
novel
drunkard
confession
the
next
good
woman
a
love
tale
another
most
popular
this
flirtations
of
mother
and
lastly
the
crowning
success
of
his
life
the
other
half
lives
by
a
baronet
wife
and
the
publishers
now
are
all
down
on
their
knees
as
they
offer
what
fees
he
may
happen
to
please
and
success
he
discerns
as
with
rapture
he
learns
the
amount
that
he
earns
from
his
returns
i
omit
the
last
here
in
royalty
for
reasons
of
scansion
and
not
from
disloyalty
the
moral
of
this
is
quite
easy
to
see
if
a
popular
author
you
anxious
to
be
you
wo
care
a
digamma
for
truth
or
for
grammar
be
far
from
straitlaced
upon
questions
of
taste
and
do
trouble
to
polish
your
style
or
to
bevel
but
always
write
down
to
the
popular
level
be
vulgar
and
smart
and
you
get
to
the
heart
of
the
persons
directing
the
mart
and
your
writings
must
reach
it
a
figure
of
speech
the
well
what
shall
we
call
it
compositor
devil
the
motriot
robert
was
chickens
chickens
all
the
way
with
children
crossing
the
road
like
mad
police
disguised
in
the
hedgerows

and
large
white
flags
they
had
at
nine
o
this
very
day
broke
the
record
to
tunbridge

and
i
shouted
aloud
to
all
concerned
give
room
good
folk
do
you
hear
my
bells
but
my
motor
skidded
and
overturned
then
exploded
and
afterwards
what
smells
it
was
i
rode
over
the
son
of
a
butcher
rolled
him
all
of
a
heap
nought
man
could

did
i
leave
undone
and
i
thought
that
butcher
boys
were
cheap
but
this
poor
man
was
his
only

in
my
motor
now
just

better
yet

i
entered

thus
i

i

the
ballad
of
the
artist
archibald
ames
is
an
artist
and
a
widely
renowned
for
albeit
his
pictures
are
thoroughly
bad
the
greatest
success
he
has
always
had
and
he
makes
his
profession
pay
he
has
no
idea
of
proportion
no
notion
of
colour
or
line
but
perhaps
for
such
there
is
little
need
since
everybody
is
fully
agreed
that
his
are
quite
divine
his
pictures
are
sweetly
simple
the
ingredients
all
must
know
just
a
child
and
a
dog
or
two
a
very
old
man
and
a
baby
shoe
and
some
bunches
of
mistletoe
in
some
an
angelic
infant
is
helping
a
kitten
to
play
or
dressing
a
cat
in
grandpapa
hat
which
is
equally
hard
on
the
hat
and
the
cat
or
teaching
a
to
pray
or
else
there
a
runaway
couple
with
a
distant
view
of
papa
an
elderly
party
with
rich
man
gout
who
swears
himself
rapidly
inside
out
in
a
or
it
may
be
a
scene
in
the
workhouse
where
a
widow
of
high
degree
with
almost
suspiciously
hair
has
arrived
in
a
gorgeous
to
distribute
a
pound
of
tea
sometimes
he
portrays
a
battle
with
a
like
a
rugby
scrum
where
a
bugler
the
colours
grasped
in
his
hand
and
making
a
final
determined
stand
plays
save
the
king
on
a
drum
this
is
the
kind
of
subject
that
he
gives
to
us
day
by
day
you
may
jeer
at
the
absence
of
all
technique
but
these
are
the
pictures
the
people
seek
from
this
justly
renowned
in
distant
suburban
boudoirs
you
will
find
them
in
gilded
frames
prodigal
calf
a
homely
scene
boots
or
gretna
green
the
works
of
archibald
ames
and
if
they
appeal
to
the
public
in
the
usual
course
of
events
some
enterprising
manager
comes
and
buys
them
up
for
enormous
sums
and
they
serve
as
advertisements
where
the
child
is
painting
the
kitten
with
potter
indelible
dye
while
grandpapa
shows
to
the
reckless
cat
mcbride
indestructible
gibus
hat
which
one
ought
to
buy
and
the
gretna
green
arrangement
an
interest
new
acquires
by
depicting
how
great
the
advantages
are
of
the
patented
spoofenhauss
with
unpuncturable
tyres
and
the
widow
try
kay
for
mourning
as
black
as
stevenson
ink
is
curing
the
paupers
of
sundry
ills
by
the
gift
of
a
box
of
the
palest
pills
for
persons
who
may
be
pink
and
the
in
the
battle
with
trousers
of
blackett
blue
unshrinking
as
simpson
serge
and
free
as
winkleson
patent
he
and
steadfast
as
holdhard
glue
this
is
the
modern
fashion
in
the
popular
art
of
the
day
and
this
is
the
reason
that
archibald
ames
ranks
high
among
other
familiar
names
as
a
very
the
ballad
of
the
murmurous
moments
of
what
bountiful
blessings
they
bring
as
dew
to
the
dawn
of
the
suspicions
of
summer
to
spring
let
others
imagine
the
time
light
with
maidens
or
books
on
their
knee
or
live
in
the
languorous
limelight
that
tinges
the
trunk
of
the
tree
let
the
timorous
turn
to
their
tennis
or
the
bowls
to
which
bumpkins
belong
but
the
thing
for
grown
women
and
men
is
the
pastime
of
ping
and
of
pong
the
game
of
the
glorious
glamour
the
feeling
to
fight
till
you
fall
the
hurricane
hail
and
the
hammer
the
batter
and
bruise
of
the
ball
the
glory
of
getting
behind
it
the
brief
but
bewildering
bliss
the
fear
of
the
failure
to
find
it
the
madness
at
making
a
miss
the
sound
of
the
sphere
as
you
smack
it
derisive
decisive
divine
the
riotous
rush
of
your
racket
to
mix
and
to
mingle
with
mine
the
diadem
dear
to
the
king
is
how
sweet
to
the
singer
his
song
to
me
so
the
plea
of
the
ping
is
and
the
passionate
plaint
of
the
pong
i
live
for
it
love
for
it
like
it
delight
of
my
dearest
of
dreams
to
stand
and
to
strive
and
to
strike
it
so
certain
so
simple
it
seems
then
give
me
the
game
of
the
gay
time
the
ball
on
its
wandering
wing
the
pastime
for
night
or
for
the
pong
not
to
mention
the
ping
the
pessimist
life
bed
is
full
of
crumbs
and
rice
no
roses
float
on
my
lagoon
there
are
no
fingers
white
and
nice
to
rub
my
head
with
scented
ice
or
feed
me
with
a
spoon
i
think
of
all
the
days
gone
by
replete
with
black
and
blue
regret
no
comets
light
my
glaucous
sky
my
tears
are
hardly
ever
dry
i
never
can
forget
i
see
the
yellow
dog
desire
that
strains
against
the
lead
of
hope
with
lilac
eyes
and
lips
of
fire
as
all
in
vain
he
strives
to
tire
the
hand
that
holds
the
rope
i
see
the
kisses
of
the
past
like
lambkins
dying
in
the
snow
the
honeymoon
that
did
not
last
the
tinted
youth
that
flew
so
fast
and
all
this
vale
of
woe
so
raising
high
my
raucous
cry
i
ask
and
fates
no
answer
give
why
am
i
to
die
o
cruel
fortune
tell
me
why
am
i
allowed
to
live
the
place
where
the
old
cleek
broke
life
is
hollow
to
the
golfer
of
however
high
his
rank
if
the
and
the
nettle
grow
too
free
if
a
bramble
bar
his
progress
if
he
bunkered
by
a
bank
if
his
jerks
and
wobbles
off
the
tee
there
a
ditch
i
never
pass
full
of
stones
and
broken
glass
and
i
sooner
lift
my
ball
and
count
a
stroke
for
the
tears
my
vision
blot
when
i
see
the
fatal
spot
is
the
place
where
my
old
cleek
broke
there
his
haft
upon
the
table
there
his
head
upon
a
chair
and
a
better
never
felt
the
summer
rain
i
may
curse
and
i
may
swear
my
is
bare
i
shall
never
use
my
gallant
cleek
again
with
what
unaccustomed
speed
would
he
strike
the
teed
how
it
sounded
on
his
metal
at
each
stroke
not
a
flyer
in
the
game
such
parabolas
could
claim
at
the
place
where
the
old
cleek
broke
was
he
cracked
i
hardly
think
it
did
he
slip
i
do
not
know
he
had
struck
the
ball
for
forty
yards
or
more
he
was
driving
smooth
and
even
just
as
hard
as
he
could
go
i
had
never
seen
him
striking
so
before
but
i
hardly
can
complain
for
there
must
have
been
a
strain
i
had
forced
beyond
the
compass
of
a
joke
and
no
club
however
strong
could
have
lasted
over
long
at
the
place
where
the
old
cleek
broke
there
are
men
both
staid
and
sound
who
hold
it
happiness
unique
at
which
only
the
irreverent
can
scoff
that
is
reached
by
means
of
brassey
driver
niblick
spoon
or
cleek
and
that
life
is
not
worth
living
without
golf
well
i
hope
it
may
be
so
for
myself
i
only
know
that
i
never
more
shall
try
another
stroke
yes
i
wearied
of
the
sport
since
a
lesson
i
was
taught
at
the
place
where
the
old
cleek
broke
the
homes
of
london
the
happy
homes
of
london
how
beautiful
they
stand
the
crowded
human
rookeries
that
mar
this
christian
land
where
cats
in
hordes
upon
the
roof
for
nightly
music
meet
and
the
horse
with
hoof
skates
slowly
down
the
street
the
merry
homes
of
london
around
bare
hearths
at
night
with
hungry
looks
and
sickly
mien
the
children
wail
and
fight
there
woman
voice
is
only
heard
in
shrill
abusive
key
and
men
can
hardly
speak
a
word
that
is
not
blasphemy
the
healthy
homes
of
london
with
weekly
wifely
wage
the
hopeless
husbands
out
of
work
their
daily
thirst
assuage
the
overcrowded
tenement
is
comfortless
and
bare
the
atmosphere
is
redolent
of
hunger
and
despair
the
blessed
homes
of
london
by
thousands
on
her
stones
the
helpless
homeless
destitute
do
nightly
rest
their
bones
on
pavements
piccadilly
way
in
slumber
like
the
dead
their
wan
pathetic
forms
they
lay
and
make
their
humble
bed
the
free
fair
homes
of
london
from
all
the
thinking
throng
who
mourn
a
nation
apathy
the
cry
goes
up
long
and
those
who
love
old
england
name
her
welfare
and
renown
can
only
contemplate
with
shame
the
homes
of
london
town
the
happiest
land
there
sat
one
day
in
a
tavern
somewhere
near
lincoln
inn
six
working
men
imbibing
of
gin
the
potman
filled
their
tankards
with
the
liquor
each
preferred
torpid
and
somnolent

sat
and
spake
not

rude
word

when

vanished

six

if

down
through

street
which
purged
and
sweet
gleams
in
the
ambient
deluge
of
the
bemused
and
blurred
and
pinkly
lustrous
where
the
blandest
lion
in
trafalgar
square
seems
but
a
part
of
the
great
continent
of
light
an
attribute
of
the
embittered
night
how
new
how
naked
and
how
clean
couchant
slow
shimmering
superb
constant
to
one
environment
nor
even
seen
pottering
aimlessly
along
the
kerb
lo
on
the
pavement
one
of
those
grim
men
who
go
down
to
the
sea
in
ships
blaspheming
reeling
in
a
foul
ellipse
home
to
some
tangled
goes
oozing
and
flushed
sharing
his
elemental
mirth
with
all
the
jocund
undissembling
earth
drooping
his
shameless
nose
nor
hitching
up
his
drifting
shifting
clothes
and
here
is
piccadilly
loudly
dense
intractable
voluminous
immense
dear
dear
my
heart
desire
can
i
be
talking
sense
bluebeard
yes
i
am
bluebeard
and
my
name
is
one
that
children
can
not
stand
yet
once
i
used
to
be
so
tame
i
eat
out
of
a
person
hand
so
gentle
was
i
wont
to
be
a
curate
might
have
played
with
me
people
accord
me
little
praise
yet
i
am
not
the
least
alarming
i
can
recall
in
bygone
days
a
maid
once
said
she
thought
me
charming
she
was
my
friend
no
more
i
vow
and
she
in
an
asylum
now
girls
used
to
clamour
for
my
hand
girls
i
refused
in
simple
dozens
i
said
i
be
their
brother
and
they
promised
they
would
be
my
cousins
one
i
accepted
more
or
less
but
i
forgotten
her
address
they
worried
me
like
anything
by
their
proposals
day
until
at
last
i
had
to
ring
the
bell
and
have
them
cleared
away
they
longed
to
share
my
lofty
rank
also
my
balance
at
the
bank
my
hospitality
to
those
whom
i
invite
to
come
and
stay
is
famed
my
wine
like
water
flows
exactly
like
some
people
say
but
this
is
mere
impertinence
to
one
who
never
spares
expense
when
through
the
streets
i
walk
about
my
subjects
stand
and
kiss
their
hands
raise
a
refined
metallic
shout
wave
flags
and
warble
tunes
on
bands
while
bunting
hangs
on
front
with
my
commands
to
let
it
bunt
when
i
come
home
again
of
course
retainers
are
employed
to
cheer
my
paid
domestics
get
quite
hoarse
acclaiming
me
and
you
can
hear
the
welkin
ringing
to
the
sky
ay
ay
and
let
it
welk
say
i
and
yet
in
spite
of
this
there
are
some
persons
who
at
times
because
i
am
so
popular
accuse
me
of
most
awful
crimes
a
girl
once
said
i
was
a
flirt
oh
my
how
the
expression
hurt
i
flirted
in
the
least
never
for
very
long
i
mean
ask
any
lady
now
deceased
who
partner
of
my
life
has
been
oh
well
of
course
sometimes
perhaps
i
meet
a
girl
like
other
chaps
and
if
i
like
her
very
much
and
if
she
cares
for
me
a
bit
where
is
the
harm
of
look
or
touch
if
neither
of
us
mentions
it
it
is
right
i
do
suppose
but
no
one
hurt
if
no
one
knows
one
should
not
break
oneself
fast
of
little
habits
of
this
sort
which
may
be
definitely
classed
with
gambling
or
a
taste
for
port
they
should
be
dropped
until
the
heart
is
subject
to
the
will
i
knew
a
man
in
regent
street
who
at
a
very
slight
expense
by
persevering
was
ly
cured
of
total
abstinence
an
altered
life
he
has
begun
and
takes
a
glass
with
any
one
i
knew
another
man
whose
wife
was
an
suicide
she
daily
strove
to
take
her
life
and
naturally
nearly
died
but
some
such
system
she
essayed
and
now
she
eighty
in
the
shade
ah
the
new
leaves
i
try
to
turn
but
like
so
many
men
in
town
i
seem
as
with
regret
i
learn
merely
to
turn
the
corner
down
a
habit
which
i
fear
alack
makes
it
more
easy
to
turn
back
i
have
been
criticised
a
lot
i
venture
to
inquire
what
for
because
forsooth
i
have
not
got
the
instincts
of
a
bachelor
just
hear
my
story
you
will
find
how
grossly
i
have
been
maligned
i
was
unlucky
with
my
wives
so
are
the
most
of
married
men
undoubtedly
they
lost
their
lives
of
course
but
even
so
what
then
i
loved
them
like
no
other
man
and
i
love
you
bet
i
can
my
first
was
little
emmeline
more
beautiful
than
day
was
she
her
proud
aristocratic
mien
was
what
at
once
attracted
me
i
naturally
did
not
know
that
i
should
soon
dislike
her
so
but
there
it
was
and
you
infer
i
had
not
very
long
to
wait
before
my
love
for
her
turned
to
unutterable
hate
so
when
this
state
of
things
i
found
i
had
her
casually
drowned
my
next
was
sarah
sweet
but
shy
and
quite
inordinately
meek
yes
even
now
i
wonder
why
i
had
her
hanged
within
the
week
perhaps
i
felt
a
bit
upset
or
else
she
bored
me
i
forget
then
came
evangeline
my
third
and
when
i
chanced
to
be
away
she
so
i
subsequently
heard
was
wont
i
deeply
grieve
to
say
with
my
small
retinue
to
flirt
i
strangled
her
i
hope
it
hurt
isabel
was
i
think
my
next
that
is
if
i
remember
right
and
i
was
really
very
vexed
to
find
her
hair
come
off
at
night
to
falsehood
i
could
not
connive
and
so
i
had
her
boiled
alive
then
came
sophia
i
believe
her
coiffure
was
at
least
her
own
alas
she
fancied
to
deceive
her
friends
by
altering
its
tone
she
dyed
her
locks
a
flaming
red
i
suffocated
her
in
bed
susannah
maud
was
number
six
but
she
did
not
survive
a
day
poor
sue
she
had
no
parlour
tricks
and
hardly
anything
to
say
a
little
strychnine
in
her
tea
finished
her
off
and
i
was
free
yet
i
did
not
despair
and
soon
in
spite
of
failures
started
off
upon
my
seventh
honeymoon
with
jane
but
could
not
stand
her
cough
was
chronic
kindness
was
in
vain
i
pushed
her
underneath
the
train
well
after
her
i
married
kate
a
most
unpleasant
woman
oh
i
caught
her
at
the
garden
gate
kissing
a
man
i
did
know
and
as
that
did
suit
me
quite
i
blew
her
up
with
dynamite
most
married
men
so
sorely
tried
as
this
would
have
been
rather
bored
not
i
but
chose
another
bride
and
married
ruth
alas
she
snored
i
served
her
just
the
same
as
kate
and
so
she
joined
the
other
eight
my
last
was
grace
i
am
not
clear
i
she
did
like
me
much
she
used
to
scream
when
i
came
near
and
shuddered
at
my
lightest
touch
she
seemed
to
wish
to
keep
aloof
and
so
i
threw
her
off
the
roof
this
is
the
point
i
wish
to
make
from
all
the
wives
for
whom
i
grieve
whose
lives
i
had
perforce
to
take
not
one
complaint
did
i
receive
and
no
expense
was
spared
to
please
my
spouses
at
their
obsequies
my
habits
i
would
have
you
know
are
perfect
as
they
always
been
you
ask
if
i
am
good
and
go
to
church
and
keep
my
fingers
clean
i
do
i
mean
to
say
i
am
i
have
the
morals
of
a
lamb
in
my
domains
there
is
no
sin
virtue
is
rampant
all
the
time
since
i
so
thoughtfully
brought
in
a
bill
which
legalises
crime
committing
things
that
are
not
wrong
must
pall
before
so
very
long
and
if
what
you
imagine
vice
is
not
considered
so
at
all
crime
does
seem
the
least
bit
nice
there
no
temptation
then
to
fall
for
half
the
charm
of
things
we
do
is
knowing
that
we
ought
to
believe
me
then
i
am
not
bad
though
in
my
youth
i
had
to
trek
because
i
happened
to
have
had
some
difficulties
with
a
cheque
what
forgery
in
some
might
be
is
in
me
i
know
that
i
was
much
abused
no
doubt
when
i
was
young
and
rash
but
i
should
not
have
been
accused
of
misappropriating
cash
i
may
have
sneaked
a
silver
dish
well
you
may
search
me
if
you
wish
so
now
you
see
me
more
or
less
as
i
would
figure
in
your
thoughts
a
trifle
given
to
excess
and
prone
perhaps
to
vice
of
sorts
when
tempted
rather
apt
to
fall
but
still
a
good
chap
after
all
woman
with
the
dead
stephen
attracted
to
the
frozen
river
brink
where
on
a
small
impromptu
rink
the
happy
skaters
darted
left
and
right
or
circled
amorously
out
of
sight
some
some
like
falling
stars
parabolas
i
watched
the
human
swarm
and
i
was
a
woman
disarranged
knelt
on
a
chair
she
had
cold
feet
on
which
she
could
not
run
and
piteously
she
thawed
them
in
the
sun
those
feet
were
of
a
woman
that
alone
was
kneeling
a
pink
liquid
by
her
shone
which
raising
to
her
luminous
lantern
jaw
she
sipped
or
idly
stirred
it
with
a
straw
upon
her
hat
she
wore
a
kind
of
fowl
an
hummingbird
i
ween
or
else
an
owl
then
turned
to
me
i
looked
the
other
way
trembling
i
knew
the
words
she
wished
to
say
so
warm
her
gaze
the
blood
rushed
to
my
head
instinctively
i
knew
her
feet
were
dead
amorphous
feet
like
monumental
moons
vast
pontoons
superbly
varnished
to
the
ice
had
come
and
now
dangled
numb
gently
she
spoke
the
while
my
senses
whirled
of
circulations
in
the
world
wildly
she
spoke
as
babble
men
in
dreams
of
feeling
life
blood
to
extremes
but
i
ignored
her
with
deliberate
stare
until
the
indelicate
thing
began
to
swear
sensations
as
of
pins
and
needles
rose
in
tingled
toes
she
felt
the
hungry
frost
that
punctured
holes
like
concentrated
seidlitz
in
her
soles
feebly
she
stept
and
sudden
was
aware
her
feet
had
gone
they
were
no
longer
there
and
from
her
boots
was
willing
to
be
freed
she
would
not
keep
what
she
could
never
need
sullenly
i
consented
and
withdrew
from
either
heel
a
huge
chaotic
shoe
yet
for
a
time
laboriously
and
slow
she
journeyed
with
her
ponderous
boots
as
though
along
with
her
she
could
not
help
but
bear
the
bargelike
burdens
she
was
wont
to
wear
towards
me
she
reeled
and
my
uncle
cried
uncle
but
i
pushed
her
to
one
side
then
smiled
upon
her
so
she
could
not
stay
my
smile
can
frighten
away
while
thus
i
grinned
not
knowing
what
to
do
a
belted
beadle
in
immaculate
blue
plucked
at
my
sleeve
and
shattered
my
romance
wheeling
on
cushion
tires
an
ambulance
deliberately
then
he
laid
her
there
tucked
in
and
bore
away
i
did
not
care
rosemary
ballad
of
the
august
be
turned
to
september
nor
summer
to
autumn
as
yet
my
darling
you
autumn
remember
what
summer
so
sure
to
forget
age
may
extinguish
the
ember
that
glowed
in
our
hearts
when
we
met
remember
my
love
to
remember
and
i
will
forget
to
forget
knows
but
the
winds
of
december
may
drift
us
asunder
my
pet
and
if
i
forget
to
remember
remember
my
sweet
to
forget
beauty
will
fade
as
the
posy
you
gave
me
that
night
on
the
stairs
my
lips
will
not
always
be
rosy
my
head
can
not
give
itself
as
we
both
become
older
existence
draws
nigh
to
a
close
so
until
i
forgotten
your
shoulder
you
must
not
remember
my
nose
days
were
not
all
sunny
weather
even
so
we
have
nought
to
regret
ah
let
us
remember
together
until
we
forget
to
forget
portknockie
porter
apologies
to
porphyria
the
train
came
early
in
the
sullen
guard
was
soon
awake
and
threw
my
luggage
down
for
spite
to
where
the
platform
seemed
a
lake
and
did
his
best
my
box
to
break
when
sidled
up
a
porter
straight
he
mopped
the
platform
with
a
broom
and
kneeling
made
the
grate
blaze
up
within
the
and
so
dispelled
the
usual
gloom
which
done
he
came
and
took
his
seat
beside
me
doffed
his
coat
untied
his
bootlaces
and
let
his
feet
peep
coyly
out
on
either
side
then
called
me
when
no
voice
replied
he
rolled
his
up
and
rose
and
laid
his
brawny
biceps
bare
and
where
my
eyebrows
meet
my
nose
he
slowly
shook
his
fist
just
there
and
seized
me
by
my
yellow
hair
then
roughly
asked
me
had
i
got
a
head
as
empty
as
a
bubble
bidding
me
sternly
did
i
not
desire
henceforth
to
see
things
double
to
give
him
something
for
his
trouble
nor
could
my
arguments
prevail
entreaties
threats
were
all
in
vain
returned
he
to
the
tale
of
how
from
out
the
midnight
train
he
bore
my
luggage
through
the
rain
i
fixed
him
with
my
cold
grey
eye
but
all
in
vain
at
last
i
knew
that
porter
hated
me
though
why
i
can
not
understand
can
you
and
what
on
earth
was
i
to
do
next
moment
though
i
still
perspire
to
think
of
it
i
quickly
found
a
thing
to
do
and
on
the
fire
i
pushed
him
backwards
with
a
bound
and
piled
the
coal
up
all
around
cremated
him
no
pain
he
felt
as
a
shut
coop
that
holds
a
hen
i
oped
the
register
and
smelt
an
odour
as
of
burnt
my
laughter
bubbled
over
then
i
seized
him
lightly
with
the
tongs
about
his
waist
and
through
the
door
i
bore
him
burning
with
my
wrongs
and
laid
him
on
the
line
what
more
the
down
express
was
due
at
the
mark
is
on
the
metals
still
a
gruesome
stain
i
must
confess
and
when
i
pass
it
makes
me
ill
to
note
the
somewhat
painful
mess
concocted
by
the
down
express
portknockie
porter
so
he
died
the
date
of
inquest
is
deferred
is
thought
a
case
of
suicide
and
he
who
might
have
seen
or
heard
the
guard
has
never
said
a
word
the

the

with

the

to
ring
down

this
metaphor
is
freely
taken
from

or
perhaps
from
bacon
the

perused
our
future
brings
a
plethora
of
blank
when
memories
of
happier
things
will
be
our

crown
of

i
trust
you
recognise
this
line
as
being
tennyson
not
mine
my
verses
may
indeed
be
few
but
are
they
not
to
quote
the
poet
sweetest
things
that
ever
grew
beside
a
human
door
i
know
it
what
an
door
would
be
enquire
of
wordsworth
please
not
me
was
one
of
my
most
cherished
dreams
to
write
a
moral
book
some
day
what
says
the
bard
best
laid
schemes
of
mice

men
gang
aft

the

here
mentioned
by
the

is
robbie

of
course
not

and
tho
my
pen
records
each
thought
as
swift
as
the
phonetic
pitman
morality
is
not
my
o
camarados
whitman
and
like
the
porcupine
i
still
am
forced
to
ply
a
fretful
quill
we
may
be
masters
of
our
fate
as
henley
was
inspired
to
mention
yet
am
i
but
the
second
mate
upon
the
intention
for
me
the
course
direct
is
lacking
i
have
to
do
a
deal
of
tacking
to
seek
for
morals
here
a
task
of
which
you
well
may
be
despairing
has
become
of
them
you
ask
they
given
me
the
slip
like
waring
east
said
browning
once
and
i
would
make
a
similar
reply
look
east
where
in
a
garret
drear
the
author
works
without
cessation
composing
verses
for
a
ly
nominal
remuneration
and
while
he
has
the
strength
to
write
will
do
so
still
infinitum

flippant

throughout
the

disperse
yourselves
with
patient
zeal
go
perch
upon
the

hand
just
after
he
has
had
a
meal
but
should
he
still
unfriendly
be
unperch
and
hasten
back
to
o
gentle

o
happy
boy
this
copy
of
my
book
is
done
but
do
forget
that
i
enjoy
a
royalty
on
one
just
think
how
wealthy
i
should
be
if
you
would
purchase
two
or
three
no
moral
that
i
ever
took
seemed
quite
so
evident
before
if
purchasing
an
author
book
will
keep
the
wolf
from
his
it
is
our
very
obvious
mission
to
buy
up
the
entire
edition
finis
printed
by
and
constable
printers
to
his
majesty
at
the
edinburgh
university
press
the
same
fiscal
ballads
second
impression
fiscal
controversy
has
not
been
very
fruitful
in
verse
so
far
as
we
are
aware
only
one
balladist
has
found
any
genuine
inspiration
in
it
that
is
harry
graham
whose
skill
as
a
rhymer
in
other
directions
has
already
been
abundantly
proved
the
ballads
for
the
most
part
take
a
colloquial
form
and
while
containing
much
humour
are
full
of
sound
doctrine
graham
it
will
be
seen
has
great
facility
in
rhyme
and
in
all
this
rhyme
there
is
reason
when
the
general
election
comes
this
book
should
be
a
for
the
political
reciter
most
amusing
contribution
to
the
literature
of
the
fiscal
controversy
ballads
with
abundant
vigour
and
piquancy
free
both
in
intention
and
ballads
are
very
good
indeed
we
can
