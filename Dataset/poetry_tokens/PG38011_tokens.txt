the
epic
of
hades
in
february
when
the
dawn
was
slow
and
winds
lay
still
i
gazed
upon
the
fields
which
stretched
before
me
lifeless
and
the
stream
which
laboured
in
the
distance
to
the
sea
sullen
and
cold
no
force
of
fancy
took
my
thought
to
bloomy
june
when
all
the
land
lay
deep
in
crested
grass
and
through
the
dew
the
landrail
brushed
and
the
lush
banks
were
set
with
strawberries
and
the
hot
noise
of
bees
lulled
the
bright
flowers
rather
i
seemed
to
move
thro
that
weird
land
hellenic
fancy
feigned
beyond
the
fabled
river
and
the
bark
of
charon
and
forthwith
on
every
side
rose
the
thin
throng
of
ghosts
first
thro
the
gloom
of
a
dark
grove
i
strayed
a
sluggish
wood
where
scarce
the
faint
fires
of
the
setting
stars
or
some
cold
gleam
of
dawn
might
pierce
the
darkling
pines
a
twilight
drear
brooded
all
the
depths
and
filled
the
dank
and
sunken
hollows
of
the
rocks
with
shapes
of
terror
beckoning
hands
and
noiseless
feet
flitting
from
shade
to
shade
wide
eyes
that
stared
with
horror
and
dumb
mouths
which
seemed
to
cry
yet
cried
not
an
ineffable
despair
hung
over
them
and
that
dark
world
and
took
the
gazer
captive
and
a
mingled
pang
of
grief
and
anger
grown
to
fierce
revolt
and
hatred
of
the
invisible
force
which
holds
the
issue
of
our
lives
and
binds
us
fast
within
the
net
of
fate
as
the
fisher
takes
the
little
quivering
from
the
sea
and
flings
them
gasping
on
the
beach
to
die
then
spreads
his
net
for
more
and
then
again
i
knew
myself
and
those
creatures
who
lie
safe
in
the
strong
grasp
of
unchanging
law
encompassed
round
by
hands
unseen
and
chains
which
do
support
the
feeble
life
that
else
were
spent
on
barren
space
and
thus
i
came
to
look
with
less
of
horror
more
of
thought
and
bore
to
see
the
sight
of
pain
that
yet
should
grow
to
healing
when
the
concrete
stain
of
life
and
act
were
purged
and
the
cleansed
soul
renewed
by
the
slow
wear
and
waste
of
time
soared
after
æons
of
days
they
seemed
alone
those
prisoners
thro
all
time
each
soul
shut
fast
in
its
own
jail
of
woe
apart
alone
for
evermore
alone
no
thought
of
kin
or
kindly
human
glance
or
fellowship
of
suffering
or
of
sin
made
light
the
load
of
solitary
pain
ay
though
they
walked
together
or
were
prisoned
in
one
cell
with
the
partners
of
their
wrong
or
with
strange
souls
which
the
same
furies
tore
they
knew
them
not
but
suffered
still
alone
as
in
that
shape
of
hell
fools
build
on
earth
where
hopeless
sin
rots
slow
in
solitude
nor
sees
the
face
of
men
nor
hears
the
sound
of
speech
nor
feels
the
touch
of
human
hand
but
broods
a
ghost
hating
the
bare
blank
cell
the
other
self
which
brought
it
thither
hating
man
and
god
and
all
that
is
or
has
been
a
great
fear
and
pity
froze
my
blood
who
seemed
to
see
a
form
an
eastern
king
it
was
who
lay
in
pain
he
wore
a
crown
upon
his
aching
brow
and
his
white
robe
was
jewelled
with
fair
gems
of
price
the
signs
of
pomp
and
honour
and
all
luxury
which
might
prevent
desire
but
as
i
looked
there
came
a
hunger
in
the
gloating
eyes
a
quenchless
thirst
upon
the
parching
lips
and
such
unsatisfied
strainings
in
the
hands
stretched
idly
forth
on
what
i
could
not
see
some
fatal
food
of
fancy
that
i
knew
the
undying
worm
of
sense
which
frets
and
gnaws
the
unsatisfied
stained
soul
seeing
me
he
said
what
and
art
thou
too
damned
as
i
dost
know
this
thirst
as
i
and
see
as
i
the
cool
lymph
drawn
from
thee
and
mock
thy
lips
and
parch
for
ever
in
continual
thirst
and
mark
the
fair
fruit
offered
to
thy
hunger
fade
before
thy
longing
eyes
i
thought
there
was
no
other
as
i
thro
all
the
weary
lengths
of
time
the
gods
have
made
who
pined
so
long
and
found
fruition
mock
him
long
ago
when
i
was
young
on
earth
was
a
sweet
pain
to
ride
all
day
in
the
long
chase
and
feel
toil
and
the
summer
fire
my
blood
and
parch
my
lips
while
in
my
father
halls
i
knew
the
cool
bath
waited
with
its
marble
floor
and
juices
from
the
ripe
fruits
pressed
and
chilled
with
snows
from
peaks
and
troops
of
slaves
and
music
and
the
dance
and
fair
young
forms
and
dalliance
and
every
joy
of
sense
that
haunts
the
dreams
of
youth
which
strength
and
ease
corrupt
and
vacant
hours
ay
it
was
sweet
for
a
while
to
plunge
in
these
as
fair
boys
plunge
naked
in
summer
streams
all
veil
of
shame
laid
by
only
the
young
dear
body
bathed
and
sunk
in
its
delight
while
the
firm
earth
the
soft
green
pastures
gay
with
innocent
flowers
or
sober
harvest
fields
show
like
a
dream
and
nought
is
left
but
the
young
life
which
floats
upon
the
depths
of
death
to
sink
maybe
and
drown
in
pleasure
or
rise
at
length
grown
wise
and
gain
the
abandoned
shore
ah
but
at
last
the
swift
desire
waxed
stronger
and
more
strong
and
feeding
on
itself
grows
tyrannous
and
the
parched
soul
no
longer
finds
delight
in
the
cool
stream
of
old
nay
this
itself
smitten
by
the
fire
of
sense
as
by
a
flame
holds
not
its
coolness
more
and
fevered
limbs
seeking
the
fresh
tides
of
their
youth
may
find
no
more
refreshment
but
a
cauldron
fired
with
the
fires
of
nether
hell
and
a
black
rage
usurps
the
soul
and
drives
it
on
to
slake
its
thirst
with
crime
and
blood
longing
desire
unsatisfied
sick
impotent
desire
oh
i
have
known
it
ages
long
i
knew
its
pain
on
earth
ere
yet
my
life
had
grown
to
its
full
stature
thro
the
weary
years
of
manhood
nay
in
age
itself
i
knew
the
quenchless
weary
thirst
unsatisfied
by
all
the
charms
of
sense
by
wealth
and
power
and
homage
always
craving
never
quenched
the
undying
curse
of
the
soul
the
ministers
and
agents
of
my
will
drave
far
and
wide
through
all
the
land
for
me
seeking
to
find
fresh
pleasures
for
me
who
had
spent
my
sum
of
pleasure
and
had
power
not
even
in
thought
nor
faculty
to
enjoy
they
tore
apart
the
sacred
claustral
doors
of
home
for
me
defiled
the
inviolate
hearth
for
me
laid
waste
the
flower
of
humble
lives
in
hope
to
heal
the
sickly
fancies
of
the
king
till
rose
a
cry
of
pain
from
all
the
land
and
i
grew
happier
for
it
since
i
held
the
power
to
quench
desire
in
blood
but
even
thus
the
old
pain
faded
not
but
swift
again
revived
and
thro
the
sensual
dull
lengths
of
my
seraglios
i
stalked
and
marked
the
glitter
of
the
gems
the
precious
webs
plundered
from
every
clime
by
cruel
wars
that
strewed
the
sands
with
corpses
lovely
eyes
that
looked
no
look
of
love
and
fired
no
more
thoughts
of
the
flesh
rich
meats
and
fruits
and
wines
grown
flat
and
savourless
and
loathed
them
all
and
only
cared
for
power
content
to
shed
rivers
of
innocent
blood
if
only
thus
i
might
appease
my
thirst
until
i
grew
a
monster
gloating
over
blood
and
pain
ah
weary
weary
days
when
every
sense
was
satisfied
and
nothing
left
to
slake
the
parched
unhappy
soul
except
to
watch
the
writhing
limbs
and
mark
the
slow
blood
drip
drop
after
drop
as
the
life
ebbed
with
it
in
a
new
thrill
of
lust
till
blood
itself
palled
on
me
and
i
knew
the
fiend
i
was
yet
cared
not
i
who
was
brief
years
ago
only
a
careless
boy
lapt
round
with
ease
stretched
by
the
soft
and
stealing
tide
of
sense
which
now
grew
red
nor
ever
dreamed
at
all
what
furies
lurked
beneath
it
but
had
shrunk
in
indolent
horror
from
the
sight
of
tears
and
misery
and
felt
my
inmost
soul
sicken
with
the
thought
of
blood
there
comes
a
time
when
the
insatiate
brute
within
the
man
weary
with
wallowing
in
the
mire
leaps
forth
devouring
and
the
cloven
grows
to
the
rending
claw
and
the
lewd
leer
to
the
horrible
fanged
snarl
and
the
soul
sinks
and
leaves
the
man
a
devil
all
his
sin
grown
savourless
and
yet
he
longs
to
sin
and
longs
in
vain
for
ever
yet
methinks
it
was
not
for
the
gods
to
leave
me
thus
i
stinted
not
their
worship
building
shrines
to
all
of
them
the
goddess
of
love
i
served
with
hecatombs
letting
the
fragrant
fumes
of
incense
and
the
costly
steam
ascend
from
victims
year
by
year
nay
my
own
son
pelops
my
best
beloved
i
gave
to
them
offering
as
he
must
offer
who
would
gain
the
great
gods
grace
my
dearest
i
had
gained
through
long
and
weary
orgies
that
strange
sense
of
nothingness
and
wasted
days
which
blights
the
exhausted
life
bearing
upon
its
front
counterfeit
knowledge
when
the
bitter
ash
of
evil
which
the
sick
soul
loathes
appears
like
the
pure
fruit
of
wisdom
i
had
grown
as
wizards
seem
who
mingle
sensual
rites
and
forms
impure
with
murderous
spells
and
dark
enchantments
till
the
simple
people
held
my
very
weakness
wisdom
and
believed
that
in
my
withdrawn
i
kept
the
inner
mysteries
of
zeus
and
knew
the
secret
of
all
being
who
was
a
sick
and
impotent
wretch
so
sick
so
tired
that
even
bloodshed
palled
for
my
stained
soul
knowing
its
sin
hastened
to
purge
itself
with
every
rite
and
charm
which
the
dark
lore
of
priestcraft
offered
to
it
spells
obscene
the
blood
of
innocent
babes
sorceries
foul
muttered
at
midnight
these
could
occupy
my
weary
days
till
all
my
people
shrank
to
see
me
and
the
mother
clasped
her
child
who
heard
the
monster
pass
they
would
not
hear
they
listened
not
the
cold
ungrateful
gods
for
all
my
supplications
nay
the
more
i
sought
them
were
they
hidden
at
the
last
a
dark
voice
whispered
nightly
poor
wretch
that
art
so
sick
and
impotent
thyself
the
source
of
all
thy
misery
the
great
gods
ask
a
more
precious
gift
and
excellent
than
alien
victims
which
thou
prizest
not
and
givest
without
a
pang
but
shouldst
thou
take
thy
costliest
and
fairest
offering
otherwise
the
life
which
thou
hast
given
thou
mayst
recall
go
offer
at
the
shrine
thy
best
belovèd
pelops
and
appease
zeus
and
the
averted
gods
and
know
again
the
youth
and
joy
of
yore
night
after
night
while
all
the
halls
were
still
and
the
cold
stars
were
fading
into
dawn
i
lay
awake
distraught
with
warring
thoughts
my
throbbing
brain
filled
with
that
dreadful
voice
i
had
not
shrunk
from
blood
but
this
the
strong
son
of
my
youth
how
should
i
dare
this
thing
and
all
day
long
i
would
steal
from
sight
of
him
and
men
and
fight
against
the
dreadful
thought
until
the
voice
seared
all
my
burning
brain
and
clamoured
zeus
bids
thee
and
be
happy
then
i
rose
at
midnight
when
the
halls
were
still
and
raised
the
arras
and
stole
soft
to
where
my
son
lay
sleeping
for
one
moment
on
his
face
and
stalwart
limbs
i
gazed
and
marked
the
rise
and
fall
of
his
young
breast
and
the
soft
plume
which
drooped
upon
his
brow
and
felt
a
thrill
of
yearning
but
the
cold
voice
urging
me
burned
me
like
fire
three
times
i
gazed
and
turned
irresolute
till
last
it
thundered
at
me
fool
thou
art
in
hell
strike
fool
and
lose
the
burden
of
thy
chains
then
with
slow
step
i
crept
as
creeps
the
tiger
on
the
deer
raised
high
my
arm
shut
close
my
eyes
and
plunged
my
dagger
in
his
heart
and
then
with
a
flash
the
veil
fell
downward
from
my
life
and
left
myself
to
me
the
daily
sum
of
sense
the
long
continual
trouble
of
desire
the
stain
of
blood
blotting
the
stain
of
lust
the
weary
foulness
of
my
days
which
wrecked
my
heart
and
brain
and
left
me
at
the
last
a
madman
and
accursèd
and
i
knew
far
higher
than
the
sensual
slope
which
held
the
gods
whom
erst
i
worshipped
a
white
peak
of
purity
and
a
stern
voice
pealing
doom
not
the
mad
voice
of
old
which
pierced
so
deep
within
my
life
that
with
the
reeking
blade
wet
with
the
heart
blood
of
my
child
i
smote
my
guilty
heart
in
twain
ah
fool
to
dream
that
the
long
stain
of
time
might
fade
and
merge
in
one
poor
chrism
of
blood
they
taught
of
yore
my
priests
who
flattered
me
nor
knew
at
all
the
greater
god
i
know
who
sits
afar
beyond
those
earthly
shapes
passionless
pure
and
awful
as
the
dawn
that
the
gods
cared
for
costly
victims
drinking
in
the
steam
of
sacrifice
when
the
choice
hecatombs
were
offered
for
my
wrong
ah
no
there
is
no
recompense
in
these
nor
any
charm
to
cleanse
the
stain
of
sin
but
the
long
wear
of
suffering
when
the
soul
which
seized
too
much
of
pleasure
here
grows
righteous
by
the
pain
that
doth
redress
its
for
what
is
right
but
equipoise
of
nature
alternating
the
too
much
and
too
little
not
on
earth
the
salutary
silent
forces
work
their
final
victory
but
year
on
year
passes
and
age
on
age
and
leaves
the
debt
unsatisfied
while
the
soul
unloads
itself
in
pain
therefore
it
is
i
suffer
as
i
suffered
ere
swift
death
set
me
not
free
no
otherwise
and
yet
there
comes
a
healing
purpose
in
my
pain
i
never
knew
on
earth
nor
ever
here
the
evil
grows
only
the
tale
of
penalties
grown
greater
hourly
dwarfs
the
accomplished
sum
of
wrong
and
yet
desire
pursues
me
still
sick
impotent
desire
fiercer
than
that
of
earth
we
are
ourselves
our
heaven
and
hell
the
joy
the
penalty
the
yearning
the
fruition
earth
is
hell
or
heaven
and
yet
not
only
earth
but
still
after
the
swift
soul
leaves
the
gates
of
death
the
pain
grows
deeper
and
less
mixed
the
joy
purer
and
less
alloyed
and
we
are
damned
or
blest
as
we
have
lived
he
ceased
with
a
wail
like
some
complaining
wind
among
the
pines
or
pent
among
the
fretful
ocean
caves
a
sick
sad
sound
then
as
i
looked
i
saw
his
eyes
glare
horribly
his
dry
parched
lips
open
his
weary
hands
stretch
idly
forth
as
if
to
clutch
the
air
infinite
pain
and
mockery
of
hope
seest
thou
them
now
he
said
i
thirst
i
parch
i
famish
yet
they
still
elude
me
fair
and
tempting
fruit
and
cooling
waters
now
they
come
again
see
they
are
in
my
grasp
they
are
at
my
lips
now
i
shall
quench
me
nay
again
they
fly
and
mock
me
seest
thou
them
or
am
i
shut
from
hope
for
ever
hungering
thirsting
still
a
madman
and
in
hell
and
as
i
passed
in
horror
his
large
eyes
and
straining
hands
froze
all
my
soul
with
pity
then
it
was
a
woman
whom
i
saw
a
dark
pale
queen
with
passion
in
her
eyes
and
fear
and
pain
holding
her
steadfast
gaze
like
one
who
sees
some
dreadful
deed
of
wrong
worked
out
and
knows
himself
the
cause
yet
now
is
powerless
to
stay
the
wrong
he
would
seeing
me
gaze
in
pity
on
her
woe
she
turned
and
spake
with
a
low
wailing
voice
thou
well
mayst
gaze
with
horror
on
me
sir
for
i
am
lost
i
have
shed
the
innocent
blood
long
years
ago
nay
centuries
of
pain
i
have
shed
the
blood
of
him
i
loved
and
found
for
recompense
but
death
and
woe
which
purges
not
my
sin
and
yet
not
i
it
was
who
did
it
but
the
gods
who
took
a
woman
loveless
heart
and
tortured
it
with
love
as
with
a
fire
it
was
not
i
who
slew
my
love
but
fate
fate
was
which
brought
my
love
and
me
together
fate
which
barred
the
path
of
blameless
love
yet
set
love
flame
to
burn
and
smoulder
in
a
hopeless
heart
where
no
relief
might
come
the
king
was
old
and
i
a
girl
is
an
old
tale
which
runs
thro
the
sad
ages
and
was
mine
he
had
spent
his
sum
of
love
long
since
and
i
i
knew
not
a
breath
of
love
as
yet
ah
it
is
strange
to
lose
the
sense
of
maidenhood
drink
deep
of
life
to
the
very
dregs
and
yet
not
know
a
flutter
of
love
wing
love
takes
no
thought
for
pomp
or
palace
or
respect
of
men
nor
always
in
the
stately
marriage
bed
closed
round
by
silken
curtains
laid
on
down
nestles
a
rosy
form
but
wild
flowers
or
desert
tents
or
in
the
hind
low
cot
beneath
the
aspect
of
the
unconscious
stars
dwells
all
night
and
is
blest
my
love
my
life
he
was
the
old
man
son
a
fair
white
soul
not
like
the
others
whom
the
fire
of
youth
burns
like
a
flame
and
hurries
unrestrained
thro
riotous
days
and
nights
but
virginal
and
pure
as
any
maid
no
wandering
glance
he
deigned
for
all
the
maidens
young
and
fair
who
sought
their
prince
eye
but
evermore
upon
the
high
lawns
wandering
alone
he
dwelt
unwed
weaving
to
artemis
fairest
of
all
olympian
maids
a
wreath
from
the
unpolluted
meads
where
never
herd
drives
his
white
flock
nor
ever
scythe
has
come
but
the
bee
sails
upon
unfettered
wing
over
the
lawns
and
purity
waters
them
with
soft
dews
and
yet
he
showed
of
all
his
peers
most
manly
heart
and
soul
a
very
man
tender
and
true
and
strong
and
pitiful
and
in
his
limbs
and
mien
fair
as
apollo
self
it
was
at
first
in
troezen
that
i
saw
him
when
he
came
to
greet
his
sire
amid
the
crowd
of
youths
he
showed
a
prince
indeed
yet
knew
i
not
whom
was
i
saw
nor
that
i
held
the
place
which
was
his
mother
only
from
the
throng
love
with
a
barbed
dart
aiming
pierced
my
heart
ere
yet
i
knew
what
ailed
me
every
glance
fired
me
the
youthful
grace
the
tall
straight
limbs
the
swelling
sinewy
arms
the
large
dark
eyes
tender
yet
full
of
passion
the
thick
locks
tossed
from
his
brow
the
lip
and
cheek
which
bore
the
down
of
early
manhood
seemed
to
feed
my
heart
with
joy
for
when
he
stood
forth
from
the
throng
and
knelt
before
his
sire
then
raised
his
eyes
to
mine
i
felt
the
curse
of
aphrodité
burn
me
as
it
burned
my
mother
before
me
and
i
dared
not
meet
his
innocent
frank
young
eyes
said
i
then
young
ay
but
not
young
as
mine
for
i
had
known
the
secret
things
of
life
which
age
the
soul
in
a
moment
writing
on
its
front
their
mark
early
ripe
and
he
was
innocent
my
spouse
in
fitted
years
within
whose
arms
i
had
defied
the
world
i
turned
away
like
some
white
bird
that
leaves
the
flock
which
sails
high
in
mid
air
above
the
haunts
of
men
feeling
some
little
dart
within
her
breast
not
death
but
like
to
death
and
slowly
sinks
down
to
the
earth
alone
and
bears
her
hurt
unseen
by
herbless
sand
and
bitter
pool
and
pines
until
the
end
even
from
that
day
i
strove
to
gain
his
love
nay
was
not
i
but
the
cruel
gods
who
drove
me
day
by
day
we
were
together
for
in
days
of
old
women
were
free
not
pent
in
gilded
jails
as
afterwards
but
free
to
walk
alone
for
good
or
evil
free
i
hardly
took
thought
for
my
spouse
the
king
for
i
had
found
my
love
at
last
what
matter
if
it
were
a
guilty
love
yet
love
is
love
indeed
stronger
than
heaven
or
hell
day
after
day
i
set
myself
to
tempt
him
from
his
proud
and
innocent
way
for
i
had
spurned
aside
care
for
the
gods
or
men
all
but
my
love
what
need
to
tell
the
tale
was
it
a
sigh
a
blush
a
momentary
glance
which
brought
assurance
of
my
triumph
it
is
long
since
i
have
lived
i
can
not
tell
i
know
only
the
penalty
of
death
and
hell
which
followed
on
my
sin
i
knew
he
loved
it
was
not
wonderful
seeing
that
we
dwelt
a
boy
and
girl
together
i
was
fair
and
eros
fired
my
eyes
and
lent
my
voice
his
own
soft
tremulous
tones
but
when
our
souls
trembled
upon
the
verge
and
fancy
feigned
his
arms
around
me
as
we
fled
alone
to
some
free
land
of
exile
lo
a
scroll
it
may
not
be
i
fear
the
gods
we
dare
not
do
this
wrong
i
go
from
hence
and
see
thy
face
no
more
farewell
forget
the
love
we
may
not
own
go
seek
for
both
forgiveness
from
the
gods
when
i
read
the
words
the
cruel
words
methought
my
heart
stood
still
and
when
the
ebbing
life
returned
i
seemed
to
have
lost
all
thought
of
love
only
revenge
dwelt
with
me
still
the
fiercer
that
i
knew
my
hope
which
came
so
near
success
snatched
from
me
and
for
ever
when
i
rose
from
my
deep
swoon
i
bade
a
messenger
go
seek
the
king
for
me
he
came
and
sate
beside
my
couch
and
all
the
doors
were
closed
and
all
withdrawn
then
with
the
liar
art
and
hypocrite
tears
and
feigned
reluctancy
and
all
the
subtle
wiles
a
woman
draws
from
the
armoury
of
hate
i
did
instil
the
poison
to
his
soul
cunning
devices
feigned
sorrow
mention
of
his
son
regrets
and
half
confessions
these
with
hateful
skill
confused
together
drove
the
old
man
soul
to
frenzy
and
i
watched
him
with
a
sneer
turn
to
a
dotard
thirsting
for
the
life
of
his
own
child
but
how
to
do
the
deed
yet
shed
no
blood
nor
know
the
people
hate
who
loved
the
prince
i
knew
not
till
one
day
the
old
man
looking
out
upon
the
sea
besought
the
dread
poseidon
to
avenge
the
treachery
of
his
son
even
as
we
stood
gazing
upon
the
breathless
blue
a
cloud
rose
from
the
deep
a
little
fleecy
cloud
which
sudden
grew
and
grew
and
turned
the
blue
to
purple
and
a
swift
wind
rose
and
sang
higher
and
higher
and
the
sea
grew
ruffled
and
within
the
circling
bay
the
tiny
ripples
stealing
up
the
sand
plunged
loud
with
manes
of
foam
until
they
swelled
to
misty
surges
thundering
on
the
shore
then
at
the
old
man
elbow
as
i
stood
a
deep
dark
thought
sent
by
the
powers
of
ill
answering
as
now
i
know
my
own
black
hate
and
not
my
poor
dupe
anger
fired
my
soul
and
bade
me
speak
god
has
heard
thy
prayer
i
whispered
the
surge
which
wakes
and
swells
to
fury
well
i
know
what
things
shall
be
it
is
poseidon
voice
sounds
in
the
storm
and
sends
thy
vengeance
young
hippolytus
loves
as
thou
knowest
on
the
yellow
sand
hard
by
the
rippled
margin
of
the
wave
to
urge
his
flying
steeds
bid
him
go
forth
he
will
obey
and
see
what
recompense
the
god
will
send
his
wrong
in
the
old
man
eyes
a
watery
gleam
of
malice
played
awhile
i
hated
him
for
it
and
he
bade
his
son
drive
forth
his
chariot
on
the
sand
and
yoke
his
three
young
fiery
steeds
and
still
the
storm
blew
fiercer
and
more
fierce
and
the
white
crests
plunged
on
the
strand
and
the
high
promontories
resounded
and
a
mist
of
foam
blown
landward
hid
the
sounding
shore
then
saw
i
him
come
forth
and
bid
them
yoke
his
untamed
colts
i
had
not
seen
his
face
since
that
last
day
but
seeing
him
i
felt
the
old
love
spring
anew
yet
mixed
with
hate
a
storm
of
warring
passions
tho
i
knew
what
end
should
come
yet
would
i
speak
no
word
that
might
avert
it
the
old
man
looked
forth
i
think
he
had
forgotten
all
the
wrong
he
fancied
and
the
doom
he
prayed
all
but
the
father
pride
in
the
strong
son
who
was
so
young
and
bold
i
saw
a
smile
upon
the
dotard
face
when
now
the
steeds
were
harnessed
and
the
chariot
on
the
sand
along
the
circling
margin
of
the
bay
flew
swift
as
light
a
sudden
gleam
of
sun
flashed
on
the
silver
harness
as
it
went
burned
on
the
brazen
axles
of
the
wheels
and
on
the
golden
fillets
of
the
prince
doubled
the
gold
sometimes
a
larger
wave
would
dash
in
mist
around
him
and
in
fear
the
rearing
coursers
plunged
and
then
again
the
strong
young
arm
constrained
them
and
they
flashed
to
where
the
foreland
ends
the
bay
and
then
he
turned
his
chariot
a
bright
speck
now
seen
now
hidden
but
always
tho
the
surge
broke
round
it
safe
emerging
like
a
star
from
the
white
clouds
of
foam
and
as
i
watched
speaking
no
word
and
breathing
scarce
a
breath
i
saw
the
firm
limbs
strongly
set
apart
upon
the
chariot
and
the
reins
held
high
and
the
proud
head
bent
forward
with
long
locks
streaming
behind
as
nearer
and
more
near
the
swift
team
rushed
until
with
a
half
joy
it
seemed
as
if
my
love
might
yet
elude
the
slow
sure
anger
of
the
god
dull
wrath
swayed
by
a
woman
lie
but
on
the
verge
as
i
cast
my
eyes
a
vast
and
purple
wall
swelled
swiftly
towards
the
land
the
lesser
waves
sank
as
it
came
and
to
its
toppling
crest
the
waters
from
the
strand
drawn
back
left
dry
the
yellow
shore
onward
it
came
hoarse
capped
with
breaking
foam
lurid
immense
rearing
its
dreadful
height
the
chariot
sped
nearer
and
nearer
i
could
see
my
love
with
the
light
of
victory
in
his
eyes
the
smile
of
daring
on
his
lips
so
near
he
came
to
where
the
marble
confined
the
narrow
strip
of
beach
his
brave
young
eyes
fixed
steadfast
on
the
goal
in
the
pride
of
life
without
a
thought
of
death
i
strove
to
cry
but
terror
choked
my
breath
then
like
a
bull
upon
the
windy
level
of
the
plain
lashing
himself
to
rage
the
furious
wave
poising
itself
a
moment
tossing
high
its
crest
dashed
downward
on
the
strand
with
a
stamp
with
a
rush
with
a
roar
and
when
i
looked
the
shore
the
fields
the
plain
were
one
white
sea
of
churning
seething
foam
chariot
and
steeds
gone
and
my
darling
on
the
wave
white
crest
tossed
high
whirled
down
beaten
and
bruised
and
flung
dying
upon
the
marble
my
great
love
sprang
up
redoubled
and
cast
out
my
hate
and
spurned
all
thought
of
fear
and
down
the
stair
i
hurried
and
upon
the
bleeding
form
i
threw
myself
and
raised
his
head
and
clasped
his
body
to
mine
and
kissed
him
on
the
lips
and
in
his
dying
ear
confessed
my
wrong
and
saw
the
horror
in
his
dying
eyes
and
knew
that
i
was
damned
and
when
he
breathed
his
last
pure
breath
i
rose
and
slowly
spake
turned
to
a
fury
now
by
love
and
pain
to
the
old
man
who
knelt
while
all
the
throng
could
hear
my
secret
thou
fool
i
am
the
murderess
of
thy
son
and
thou
my
dupe
thou
and
thy
gods
see
he
was
innocent
i
murdered
him
for
love
i
scorn
ye
all
thee
and
thy
gods
together
who
are
deceived
by
a
woman
lying
tongue
oh
doting
fool
to
hate
thy
own
and
ye
false
powers
which
punish
the
innocent
and
let
the
guilty
soul
escape
unscathed
i
hate
ye
all
i
curse
i
loathe
you
then
i
stooped
and
kissed
my
love
and
left
them
in
amaze
and
up
the
stair
swept
slowly
to
my
chamber
and
therein
hating
my
life
and
cursing
men
and
gods
i
did
myself
to
death
but
even
here
i
find
my
punishment
oh
dreadful
doom
of
souls
like
mine
to
see
their
evil
done
always
before
their
eyes
the
one
dread
scene
of
horror
see
the
dark
wave
on
the
verge
towers
horrible
and
he
oh
love
my
love
safety
is
near
quick
quicker
urge
them
on
thou
wilt
it
yet
nay
nay
it
bursts
on
him
i
have
shed
the
innocent
blood
oh
dreadful
gaze
within
his
glazing
eyes
hide
them
ye
gods
hide
them
i
can
not
bear
them
quick
a
dagger
i
will
lose
their
glare
in
death
nay
die
i
can
not
i
must
endure
and
live
death
brings
not
peace
to
the
lost
souls
in
hell
and
her
eyes
stared
rounded
with
horror
and
she
stooped
and
gazed
so
eagerly
and
pressed
her
fevered
hands
upon
her
trembling
forehead
with
such
pain
as
drives
the
gazer
mad
then
as
i
passed
i
marked
against
the
hardly
dawning
sky
a
toilsome
figure
standing
bent
and
strained
before
a
rocky
mass
which
with
great
pain
and
agony
of
labour
it
would
thrust
up
a
steep
hill
but
when
upon
the
crest
it
poised
a
moment
then
i
held
my
breath
with
dread
for
lo
the
poor
feet
seemed
to
clutch
the
hillside
as
in
fear
and
the
poor
hands
with
hopeless
fingers
pressed
into
the
stone
in
agony
and
the
limbs
stiffened
and
a
cry
like
some
strong
swimmer
whom
the
mightier
stream
sweeps
downward
and
he
sees
his
children
eyes
upon
the
bank
broke
from
him
and
at
last
after
long
struggles
of
despair
the
limbs
relaxed
and
as
i
closed
my
fearful
eyes
seeing
the
inevitable
doom
a
crash
a
horrible
thunderous
noise
as
down
the
steep
the
shameless
fragment
leapt
from
crag
to
crag
it
bounded
ever
swifter
striking
fire
and
wrapt
in
smoke
as
to
the
lowest
depths
of
the
vale
it
tore
and
seemed
to
take
with
it
the
miserable
form
whose
painful
gaze
i
caught
as
with
the
great
rock
whirled
and
dashed
downward
and
marking
every
crag
with
gore
and
long
gray
hairs
it
plunged
yet
living
still
to
the
black
hollow
and
then
a
silence
came
more
dreadful
than
the
noise
and
a
low
groan
was
all
that
i
could
hear
when
to
the
foot
of
the
dark
steep
i
hurried
half
in
hope
to
find
the
victim
dead
not
recognizing
the
undying
life
of
hell
i
seemed
to
see
an
aged
man
bruised
bleeding
with
gray
hairs
and
eyes
from
which
the
cunning
leer
of
greed
was
scarcely
yet
gone
out
a
crafty
voice
it
was
that
answered
me
the
voice
of
guile
part
purified
by
pain
there
comes
not
death
to
those
who
live
in
hell
nor
hardly
pause
of
suffering
longer
than
may
serve
to
make
the
pain
renewed
more
piercing
long
ago
i
thought
that
i
had
cheated
death
and
now
i
seek
him
but
he
comes
not
nor
know
i
if
ever
he
will
hear
me
whence
art
thou
comest
thou
from
earthly
air
or
whence
what
power
has
brought
thee
hither
for
i
know
indeed
thou
art
not
lost
as
i
for
never
here
i
look
upon
a
human
face
nor
see
the
ghosts
who
doubtless
here
on
every
side
suffer
a
common
pain
only
at
times
i
hear
the
echo
of
a
shriek
far
off
like
some
faint
ghost
of
woe
which
fills
the
pause
and
interval
of
suffering
but
from
whom
the
voice
may
come
or
whence
i
know
not
only
the
air
teems
with
vague
pain
which
doth
distract
the
ear
when
for
a
moment
comes
surcease
of
agony
and
the
sense
of
effort
spent
in
vain
and
fruitless
labour
and
the
pang
of
defeat
which
waits
and
takes
the
heart
and
maddens
it
when
all
heaven
conscience
happiness
are
staked
and
lost
for
gains
which
still
elude
it
yet
was
sweet
a
king
in
early
youth
when
pleasure
is
sweet
to
live
the
fair
successful
years
and
know
the
envy
and
respect
of
men
i
cared
for
none
of
youth
delights
the
dance
the
song
allured
me
not
the
smooth
soft
ways
of
sense
tempted
me
not
at
all
i
could
despise
the
follies
that
i
shared
not
spending
all
the
long
laborious
days
in
toilsome
schemes
to
compass
honour
and
wealth
and
as
i
grew
in
name
and
fame
finding
my
hoarded
gains
transmuted
into
power
the
seas
were
white
with
laden
argosies
and
all
were
mine
the
sheltering
moles
defied
the
wintry
storms
and
all
were
mine
the
marble
aqueducts
the
costly
bridges
all
were
mine
fair
roads
wound
round
and
round
the
hills
my
work
the
gods
alone
i
heeded
not
nor
cared
at
all
for
aught
but
that
my
eyes
and
ears
might
take
spurning
invisible
things
nor
built
i
to
them
temple
or
shrine
wrapt
up
in
life
set
round
with
earthly
blessings
like
a
god
i
rose
to
such
excess
of
weal
and
fame
and
pride
my
people
held
me
i
grew
drunk
with
too
great
power
scoffing
at
men
and
gods
careless
of
both
but
not
averse
to
fling
to
those
too
weak
themselves
what
benefits
my
larger
wisdom
spurned
then
suddenly
i
knew
the
pain
of
failure
summer
storms
sucked
down
my
fleets
even
within
sight
of
port
a
grievous
blight
wasted
the
mocking
my
hopes
of
gain
wars
came
and
drained
my
store
and
i
grew
needy
knowing
now
the
hell
of
stronger
souls
the
loss
of
power
wherein
they
exulted
once
there
comes
no
pain
deeper
than
to
have
known
delight
of
power
and
then
to
lose
it
all
but
i
i
would
not
sit
tame
beneath
defeat
trimming
my
sails
to
wait
the
breeze
of
fortune
fickle
breath
which
perhaps
might
breathe
no
more
but
chose
instead
by
rash
conceit
and
bolder
enterprise
to
win
her
aid
again
i
had
no
thought
of
selfish
gain
only
to
be
and
act
as
a
god
to
those
feeding
my
sum
of
pride
with
acted
good
but
evermore
defeat
dogged
me
and
evermore
my
people
grew
to
doubt
me
seeing
no
more
the
wealth
the
force
which
once
they
worshipped
then
the
lust
of
power
loved
not
for
sake
of
others
but
itself
grew
on
me
and
the
pride
which
can
dare
all
save
failure
only
seized
me
evil
finds
its
ready
chance
there
were
rich
argosies
upon
the
seas
i
sank
them
ship
and
crew
in
the
unbetraying
ocean
wayfarers
crossing
the
passes
with
rich
merchandise
my
creatures
hid
behind
the
crags
with
rocks
hurled
downward
yet
i
spent
my
gains
for
the
public
weal
not
otherwise
and
they
the
careless
people
took
the
piteous
spoils
which
cost
the
lives
of
many
and
a
man
soul
and
blessed
the
giver
empty
venal
blessings
which
sting
more
deep
than
curses
for
awhile
i
was
content
with
this
but
at
the
last
a
great
contempt
and
hatred
of
them
took
me
the
base
vile
churls
why
should
i
stain
my
soul
for
such
as
those
dogs
that
would
fawn
and
lick
the
hand
that
fed
them
but
if
food
should
fail
would
turn
and
rend
me
i
would
none
of
them
i
would
grow
rich
and
happy
being
indeed
godlike
in
brain
to
such
so
with
all
craft
and
guile
and
violence
i
enriched
me
loading
my
treasuries
with
gold
my
schemes
of
gain
engrossed
the
long
laborious
days
stretched
far
into
the
night
enjoy
i
might
not
seeing
it
was
all
to
do
and
life
so
brief
that
ere
a
man
might
gain
the
goal
he
would
lo
age
and
with
it
death
and
so
an
end
for
all
the
tales
of
the
indignant
gods
what
were
they
but
the
priests
i
had
myself
broken
all
oaths
long
time
deceived
and
ruined
with
every
phase
of
fraud
the
pious
fools
whom
justice
bound
battened
on
blood
and
what
was
i
the
worse
how
should
the
gods
bear
rule
if
i
were
happy
death
alone
was
certain
therefore
must
i
haste
to
heap
treasure
sufficient
for
my
need
and
then
enjoy
the
gathered
good
but
gradually
there
came
not
great
disasters
which
might
crush
all
hope
but
petty
checks
which
did
decrease
my
store
and
left
my
labour
vain
and
me
unwilling
to
enjoy
and
gradually
i
felt
the
chill
approach
of
age
which
stole
higher
and
higher
on
me
till
the
life
as
in
a
paralytic
left
my
limbs
and
heart
and
mounted
upwards
to
my
brain
its
last
resort
and
rested
there
awhile
ere
it
should
spread
its
wings
but
even
thus
tho
powerless
to
enjoy
the
insatiate
greed
and
thirst
of
power
sustained
me
and
supplied
life
spark
with
some
scant
fuel
till
it
seemed
year
after
year
as
if
i
could
not
die
holding
so
fast
to
life
i
grew
so
old
that
all
the
comrades
of
my
youth
my
prime
my
age
were
gone
and
i
was
left
alone
with
those
who
knew
me
not
bereft
of
all
except
my
master
passion
an
old
man
forlorn
forgotten
of
the
gods
and
death
so
all
the
people
seeing
me
grow
old
and
prosperous
held
me
wise
and
spread
abroad
strange
fables
growing
day
by
day
more
strange
how
i
deceived
the
very
gods
they
thought
that
i
was
blest
remembering
not
the
wear
of
anxious
thought
the
growing
sum
of
pain
the
failing
ear
and
eye
the
slower
limbs
whose
briefer
name
is
age
and
yet
i
trow
i
was
not
all
unhappy
though
i
knew
it
was
too
late
to
enjoy
and
though
my
store
increased
not
as
my
greed
nay
even
sunk
down
a
little
year
by
year
till
last
of
all
when
now
my
time
was
come
and
i
had
grown
a
little
tired
of
living
a
trivial
hurt
laid
me
upon
my
bed
and
as
i
mused
on
my
long
life
and
all
its
villanies
the
wickedness
i
did
the
blood
i
shed
the
guile
the
frauds
of
years
they
came
with
news
one
now
and
now
another
how
my
schemes
were
crushed
my
enterprises
lost
my
toil
and
labour
all
in
vain
day
after
day
they
brought
these
tidings
while
i
longed
to
rise
and
stay
the
tide
of
ill
and
raved
to
know
i
could
not
at
the
last
the
added
sum
of
evil
like
yon
great
rock
poised
awhile
uncertain
gathered
into
one
my
feeble
strength
and
left
me
ruined
and
lost
and
showed
me
all
i
was
and
all
the
depth
and
folly
of
my
sin
and
racked
my
brain
and
sank
me
in
despair
and
misery
and
broke
my
heart
and
slew
me
therefore
is
i
spend
the
long
long
centuries
which
have
come
between
me
and
my
sin
in
such
dread
tasks
as
that
thou
sawest
in
the
soul
i
sinned
in
body
and
soul
i
suffer
what
i
bade
my
minions
do
to
others
that
of
woe
i
bear
myself
and
in
the
pause
of
ill
as
now
i
know
again
the
bitter
pang
of
failure
which
of
old
pierced
thro
my
soul
and
left
me
to
despair
the
pain
of
mind
is
fiercer
far
than
any
bodily
ill
and
both
are
mine
the
pang
of
always
recurring
and
far
worse
the
pang
of
consciousness
of
black
sins
sinned
in
vain
the
doom
of
constant
failure
will
fierce
will
thou
parent
of
unrest
and
toil
and
woe
measureless
effort
growing
day
by
day
to
force
strong
souls
along
the
giddy
steep
that
slopes
to
the
pit
of
hell
where
effort
serves
only
to
speed
destruction
yet
i
know
thou
art
not
as
some
hold
the
primal
curse
which
doth
condemn
us
since
thou
bearest
in
thee
no
power
to
satisfy
thyself
but
rather
the
spring
of
act
whereby
in
earth
and
heaven
both
men
and
gods
do
breathe
and
live
and
are
since
life
is
act
and
not
to
do
is
death
i
do
not
blame
thee
but
to
work
in
vain
is
bitterest
penalty
to
find
at
last
the
soul
all
fouled
with
sin
and
stained
with
blood
in
vain
ah
this
is
hell
indeed
the
hell
of
lost
and
striving
souls
then
as
i
passed
the
halting
figure
bent
itself
again
to
the
old
task
and
up
the
rugged
steep
thrust
the
great
rock
with
groanings
horror
chained
my
parting
footsteps
like
a
nightmare
dream
which
holds
us
that
we
flee
not
with
wide
eyes
that
loathe
to
see
yet
can
not
choose
but
gaze
till
all
be
done
slowly
with
dreadful
toil
and
struggle
and
strain
and
bleeding
hands
and
knees
and
more
than
mortal
strength
against
the
hill
he
pressed
the
wretched
one
till
with
long
pain
he
trembled
on
the
summit
a
gaunt
form
with
that
great
rock
above
him
poised
and
strained
now
gaining
now
receding
now
in
act
to
win
the
summit
now
borne
down
again
and
then
the
inevitable
crash
the
mass
leaping
from
crag
to
crag
but
ere
it
ceased
in
dreadful
silence
and
the
low
groan
came
my
limbs
were
loosed
with
one
convulsive
bound
i
hid
my
face
within
my
hands
and
fled
surfeit
with
horror
then
it
was
again
a
woman
whom
i
saw
pitiless
stern
bearing
the
brand
of
blood
a
lithe
dark
form
and
cruel
eyes
which
glared
beneath
the
gems
that
argued
her
a
queen
and
on
her
side
an
ancient
stain
of
gore
which
did
befoul
her
royal
robe
a
murderess
in
thought
and
dreadful
act
who
took
within
the
toils
her
kingly
lord
and
slew
him
of
old
time
after
burnt
troy
i
had
no
time
to
speak
when
she
shrieked
thus
it
doth
repent
me
not
i
would
yet
to
do
and
i
would
do
it
again
a
thousand
times
if
the
shed
blood
might
for
one
hour
restore
me
to
the
kisses
of
my
ægisthus
oh
he
was
divine
my
hero
with
the
godlike
locks
and
eyes
of
eros
self
what
boots
it
that
they
prate
of
wifely
duty
love
of
spouse
or
child
honour
or
pity
when
the
swift
fire
takes
a
woman
heart
and
burns
it
out
and
leaps
with
fierce
forked
tongue
around
it
till
it
lies
in
ashes
a
dead
heart
nor
aught
remains
of
old
affections
naught
but
the
new
flame
which
is
unquenched
desire
it
did
not
come
my
blessing
all
at
once
but
the
slow
fruit
of
solitude
and
midnight
loneliness
and
weary
waiting
for
the
tardy
news
of
taken
troy
long
years
i
sate
alone
widowed
within
my
palace
while
my
lord
was
over
seas
waging
the
accursèd
war
first
of
the
file
of
kings
year
after
year
came
false
report
or
harder
no
report
of
the
great
fleet
the
summers
waxed
and
waned
the
wintry
surges
smote
the
sounding
shores
and
yet
there
came
no
end
of
it
they
brought
now
hopeless
failure
now
great
victories
and
all
alike
were
false
all
but
delay
and
hope
deferred
which
cometh
not
but
breaks
the
heart
which
suffering
wrings
not
so
i
bore
long
time
the
solitary
years
and
sought
to
solace
the
dull
days
with
motherly
cares
for
those
my
lord
had
left
me
my
firstborn
iphigeneia
sailed
at
first
with
him
upon
that
fatal
voyage
but
the
young
orestes
and
electra
stayed
with
me
not
dear
as
she
was
for
the
firstborn
takes
the
mother
heart
and
with
the
milk
it
draws
from
the
mother
virgin
breast
drains
all
the
love
it
bore
ay
even
tho
the
sire
be
dear
much
more
then
when
he
is
a
king
indeed
mighty
in
war
and
council
but
too
high
to
stoop
to
a
woman
love
but
she
was
gone
nor
heard
i
tidings
of
her
knowing
not
if
yet
she
walked
the
earth
nor
if
she
bare
the
load
of
children
even
as
i
had
borne
her
in
my
opening
girlhood
when
i
leapt
from
child
to
queen
but
never
loved
the
king
thus
the
slow
years
rolled
onward
till
at
last
there
came
a
dreadful
rumour
is
dead
thy
daughter
years
ago
the
cruel
priests
clamoured
for
blood
the
stern
cold
kings
stood
round
without
a
tear
and
he
her
sire
with
them
to
see
a
virgin
bleed
they
cut
with
knives
the
taper
girlish
throat
they
watched
the
blood
drip
slowly
on
the
sand
and
the
young
life
meek
as
a
lamb
come
to
the
sacrifice
to
appease
the
angry
gods
and
he
the
king
her
father
stood
by
too
and
saw
them
do
it
the
wickedness
breathing
no
word
of
wrath
till
all
was
done
the
cowards
the
dull
cowards
i
would
some
black
storm
bursting
suddenly
had
whelmed
them
and
their
fleets
ere
yet
they
dared
to
waste
an
innocent
life
i
had
gone
mad
i
know
it
but
for
him
my
love
my
dear
my
fair
sweet
love
he
came
to
comfort
me
with
words
of
friendship
holding
that
my
lord
was
bound
perhaps
to
let
her
die
gods
were
ofttimes
hard
to
appease
or
was
it
indeed
the
priests
who
asked
it
were
there
any
gods
or
only
phantoms
creatures
of
the
brain
born
of
the
fears
of
men
the
greed
of
priests
useful
to
govern
women
had
he
been
lord
of
the
fleet
not
all
the
soothsayers
who
ever
frighted
cowards
should
have
brought
his
soul
to
such
black
depths
i
hearkening
to
him
as
my
own
thought
grown
articulate
found
my
grief
turn
to
hate
and
hate
to
love
hate
of
my
lord
love
of
the
voice
which
spoke
such
dear
and
comfortable
words
and
thus
love
to
a
storm
of
passion
growing
swept
my
wounded
soul
and
dried
my
tears
as
dries
the
hot
sirocco
all
the
bitter
pools
of
salt
among
the
sand
i
never
knew
true
love
before
i
was
a
child
no
more
when
the
king
cast
his
eyes
on
me
what
is
it
to
have
borne
the
weight
of
offspring
the
zone
if
love
be
not
their
sire
or
live
long
years
of
commerce
not
of
love
better
a
day
of
passion
than
the
long
unlovely
years
of
wifely
duty
when
love
cometh
not
to
wake
the
barren
days
and
yet
at
first
i
hesitated
long
nor
would
embrace
the
blessing
that
was
mine
we
are
hedged
round
we
women
by
such
ordinances
set
round
us
by
our
tyrants
that
we
fear
to
overstep
a
hand
breadth
the
dull
bounds
of
custom
but
at
last
love
waking
in
me
burst
all
my
chains
asunder
and
i
lived
for
naught
but
love
my
son
the
young
orestes
i
sent
far
off
my
girl
electra
only
remained
too
young
to
doubt
me
and
i
knew
at
last
what
was
to
live
so
the
swift
years
fleeted
and
found
me
happy
till
the
dark
day
when
rumour
whispered
of
taken
troy
and
from
my
dream
of
happiness
sudden
i
woke
and
knew
the
coming
retribution
we
had
grown
too
loving
for
concealment
and
our
tale
of
mutual
love
was
bruited
far
and
wide
through
argos
all
the
gossips
bruited
it
and
were
all
tongue
to
tell
it
to
the
king
when
he
should
come
and
should
the
cold
proud
lord
i
never
loved
the
murderer
of
my
girl
come
my
love
and
me
a
swift
resolve
flashed
through
me
pondering
on
it
love
for
love
and
blood
for
blood
the
simple
golden
rule
taught
by
the
elder
gods
when
i
had
taken
my
fixed
resolve
i
grew
impatient
for
it
counting
the
laggard
days
oh
it
was
sweet
to
simulate
the
yearning
of
a
wife
long
parted
from
her
lord
and
mock
the
fools
who
dogged
each
look
and
word
and
but
for
fear
had
torn
me
from
my
throne
the
pies
the
jays
the
impotent
chatterers
who
thought
by
words
to
stay
me
in
the
act
was
sweet
to
mock
them
and
read
distrust
within
their
eyes
when
i
knowing
my
purpose
bade
them
quick
prepare
all
fitting
honours
for
the
king
and
knew
they
dared
not
disobey
oh
was
enough
to
wing
the
hours
but
when
at
last
i
saw
his
sails
upon
the
verge
and
then
the
ship
and
marked
his
face
grown
old
the
body
a
little
bent
which
was
so
straight
the
thin
gray
hairs
which
were
the
raven
locks
of
manhood
when
he
went
i
felt
a
moment
i
could
not
do
the
deed
but
when
i
saw
the
beautiful
sad
woman
come
with
him
the
future
in
her
eyes
and
her
sad
voice
proclaimed
the
tale
of
doom
two
thoughts
at
once
assailed
me
bidding
me
despatch
with
a
blow
him
and
his
mistress
making
sure
the
will
of
fate
and
my
revenge
oh
it
was
strange
to
see
all
happen
as
we
planned
as
some
drama
oft
rehearsed
wherein
each
step
each
word
is
so
prepared
the
poorest
player
knows
his
turn
come
to
do
the
solemn
landing
the
ride
to
the
palace
gate
the
courtesies
of
welcome
the
mute
crowds
without
the
bath
prepared
within
the
precious
circling
folds
of
tissue
stretched
around
him
shutting
out
the
gaze
and
folding
helpless
like
a
net
the
mighty
limbs
the
laid
down
against
the
wall
and
i
his
wife
and
queen
alone
with
him
waiting
and
watching
still
till
the
woman
shrieked
without
then
with
swift
step
i
seized
the
axe
and
struck
him
as
he
lay
helpless
once
twice
and
thrice
once
for
my
girl
once
for
my
love
once
for
the
woman
and
all
for
fate
and
my
revenge
he
gave
a
groan
once
only
as
i
thought
he
might
and
then
no
sound
but
the
quick
gurgling
of
the
blood
as
it
flowed
from
him
in
streams
and
turned
the
pure
and
limpid
water
of
the
bath
to
red
i
had
not
looked
for
that
it
flowed
and
flowed
and
seemed
to
madden
me
to
look
on
it
until
my
love
with
hands
bloody
as
mine
but
with
the
woman
blood
rushed
in
and
eyes
rounded
with
horror
and
we
turned
to
go
and
left
the
dead
alone
but
happiness
still
mocked
me
and
a
doubt
unknown
before
came
on
me
and
amid
the
silken
shows
and
luxury
of
power
i
seemed
to
see
another
answer
to
my
riddle
of
life
than
that
i
gave
myself
and
it
was
and
in
my
people
sullen
mien
and
eyes
and
in
the
mirror
when
i
looked
glared
out
and
terror
lest
my
son
returning
grown
to
manhood
should
avenge
his
father
blood
for
somehow
as
seem
the
gods
if
gods
there
be
or
the
stern
fate
which
doth
direct
our
little
lives
do
filch
our
happiness
though
bright
with
love
own
ray
there
comes
a
cloud
which
veils
it
yet
indeed
my
days
were
happy
i
repent
me
not
i
would
wade
through
seas
of
blood
to
know
again
those
fierce
delights
once
more
but
my
young
girl
electra
grown
to
woman
turned
from
me
her
modest
maiden
eyes
nor
loved
to
set
her
kiss
upon
my
cheek
but
all
distraught
with
secret
care
hid
her
from
all
the
pomps
and
revelries
which
did
befit
her
youth
walking
alone
and
often
at
the
tomb
of
her
lost
sire
they
found
her
pouring
out
libations
to
the
dead
and
evermore
i
did
bethink
me
of
my
son
orestes
who
now
should
be
a
man
and
yearned
sometimes
to
see
his
face
yet
feared
lest
from
his
eyes
his
father
soul
should
smite
me
so
i
lived
happy
and
yet
unquiet
a
stern
voice
speaking
of
doom
which
long
time
softer
notes
of
careless
weal
the
music
that
doth
spring
from
the
fair
harmonies
of
life
and
love
would
drown
in
their
own
concord
this
at
times
nay
day
by
day
stronger
and
dreadfuller
with
dominant
accent
marred
the
sounds
of
joy
by
one
prevailing
discord
so
at
length
i
came
to
lose
the
present
in
the
dread
of
what
might
come
the
penalty
that
waits
upon
successful
sin
who
having
sinned
had
missed
my
sin
reward
until
one
day
i
looking
from
my
palace
casement
saw
a
humble
suppliant
clad
in
pilgrim
garb
approach
the
marble
stair
a
sudden
throb
thrilled
thro
me
and
the
mother
heart
went
forth
thro
all
disguise
of
garb
and
rank
and
years
knowing
my
son
how
fair
he
was
how
tall
and
vigorous
my
boy
what
strong
straight
limbs
and
noble
port
how
beautiful
the
shade
of
manhood
on
his
lip
i
longed
to
burst
from
my
chamber
down
yearning
to
throw
myself
upon
his
neck
within
the
palace
court
before
the
guards
spurning
my
queenly
rank
all
but
my
motherhood
and
then
a
chill
of
doubt
me
knowing
what
a
gulf
fate
set
between
our
lives
impassable
as
that
great
gulf
which
yawns
life
and
death
and
this
hell
and
heaven
i
shrank
back
and
turned
to
think
a
moment
half
in
fear
and
half
in
pain
dividing
the
swift
mind
yet
all
in
love
then
came
a
cry
a
groan
from
the
inner
court
the
clash
of
swords
the
fall
of
a
body
on
the
pavement
and
one
cried
king
is
dead
slain
by
the
young
orestes
who
cometh
hither
with
the
word
the
door
flew
open
and
my
son
stood
straight
before
me
his
drawn
sword
dripping
blood
oh
he
was
fair
and
terrible
to
see
when
from
his
limbs
the
suppliant
mantle
fallen
left
the
mail
and
arms
of
a
young
warrior
love
and
hate
which
are
the
offspring
of
a
common
sire
strove
for
the
mastery
till
within
his
eyes
i
saw
his
father
ghost
glare
unappeased
from
out
love
casements
then
i
knew
my
fate
and
his
mine
to
be
slain
by
my
son
hand
and
his
to
slay
me
since
the
furies
drave
our
lives
to
one
destruction
and
i
took
his
point
within
my
breast
but
i
praise
not
the
selfish
careless
gods
who
wrecked
our
lives
making
the
king
the
murderer
of
his
girl
and
me
his
murderess
making
my
son
the
murderer
of
his
mother
and
her
love
a
mystery
of
blood
i
curse
them
all
the
careless
forces
sitting
far
withdrawn
upon
the
heights
of
space
taking
men
lives
for
playthings
and
deriding
as
in
sport
our
happiness
and
woe
i
curse
them
all
we
have
a
right
to
joy
we
have
a
right
i
say
as
they
have
let
them
stand
confessed
the
puppets
that
they
are
too
weak
to
give
the
good
they
feign
to
love
since
fate
too
strong
for
them
as
us
beyond
their
painted
sky
sits
and
derides
them
too
i
curse
fate
too
the
deaf
blind
fury
taking
human
souls
and
crushing
them
as
a
dull
fretful
child
crushes
its
toys
and
knows
not
with
what
skill
those
feeble
forms
are
feigned
i
curse
i
loathe
i
spit
on
them
it
doth
repent
me
not
i
would
yet
to
do
i
have
lived
my
life
i
have
loved
see
there
he
lies
within
the
bath
and
thus
i
smite
him
thus
didst
hear
him
groan
oh
vengeance
thou
art
sweet
what
living
still
ah
me
we
can
not
die
come
torture
me
ye
furies
for
i
love
not
soothing
words
as
once
ye
did
my
son
ye
miserable
blind
ministers
of
hell
i
do
defy
you
not
all
your
torments
can
undo
the
past
of
passion
and
of
love
even
as
she
spake
there
came
a
viewless
trouble
in
the
air
which
took
her
and
a
sweep
of
wings
unseen
and
terrible
sounds
which
swooped
on
her
and
hushed
her
voice
and
seemed
to
occupy
her
soul
with
horror
and
despair
and
as
she
passed
i
marked
her
agonized
eyes
but
as
i
went
full
many
a
dreadful
shape
of
lonely
pain
i
saw
what
need
to
tell
them
we
are
filled
who
live
with
a
more
present
sense
of
the
great
love
of
god
than
those
of
old
who
groping
in
the
dawn
of
knowledge
saw
only
dark
shadows
of
the
unknown
or
he
of
modern
singers
who
swept
deep
his
awful
lyre
and
woke
the
voice
of
song
dumb
for
long
centuries
of
pain
we
dread
to
dwell
on
those
long
agonies
its
sin
brings
on
the
offending
soul
who
hold
a
creed
of
deeper
pity
knowing
what
chains
of
ill
bind
round
our
petty
lives
each
phase
of
woe
suffering
and
torture
which
the
gloomy
thought
of
bigots
feigns
for
others
all
were
there
one
there
was
stretched
upon
a
rolling
wheel
which
was
the
barren
round
of
sense
that
still
returned
upon
itself
and
broke
the
limbs
bound
to
it
day
and
night
others
i
saw
doomed
with
unceasing
toil
to
fill
the
urns
whose
precious
waters
sank
ere
they
could
slake
their
burning
thirst
another
shapeless
soul
full
of
revolts
and
hates
and
tyrannous
force
the
weight
of
earth
which
was
its
taint
pressed
groaning
down
while
with
fierce
beak
and
claw
the
vulture
of
remorse
piercing
his
breast
preyed
on
his
heart
for
others
overhead
great
crags
of
rock
impending
seemed
to
fall
but
fell
not
nor
brought
peace
i
felt
my
soul
blunted
with
horrors
yearning
to
escape
to
where
upon
the
limits
of
the
wood
some
scanty
twilight
grew
but
ere
i
passed
from
those
grim
shades
a
deep
voice
sounded
near
a
voice
without
a
form
there
is
an
end
of
all
things
that
thou
seest
there
is
an
end
of
wrong
and
death
and
hell
when
the
long
wear
of
time
and
suffering
has
effaced
the
stain
ingrown
upon
the
soul
and
the
cleansed
spirit
long
ages
floating
on
the
wandering
winds
or
rolling
deeps
of
space
renews
itself
and
doth
regain
its
dwelling
and
once
more
blent
with
the
general
order
floats
anew
upon
the
stream
of
things
and
comes
at
length
after
new
deaths
to
that
dim
thou
next
shalt
see
and
with
the
justified
white
souls
awaits
the
end
or
snatched
at
once
if
fate
so
will
to
the
pure
sphere
itself
lives
and
is
blest
and
works
the
eternal
work
whose
name
and
end
is
love
there
is
an
end
of
wrong
and
death
and
hell
even
as
i
heard
i
passed
from
out
the
shadow
of
death
and
pain
crying
there
is
an
end
end
of
book
i
book
ii
hades
then
from
those
dark
and
dreadful
precincts
passing
ghostly
fields
and
voiceless
took
me
a
faint
twilight
veiled
the
leafless
shadowy
trees
and
herbless
plains
there
stirred
no
breath
of
air
to
wake
to
life
the
slumbers
of
the
world
the
sky
above
was
one
gray
changeless
cloud
there
looked
no
eye
of
life
from
the
veiled
heavens
but
sleep
and
death
were
round
me
everywhere
and
yet
no
fear
nor
horror
took
me
here
where
was
no
pain
nor
dread
save
that
strange
tremor
which
assails
one
who
in
life
hot
noontide
looks
on
death
and
knows
he
too
shall
die
the
ghosts
which
rose
from
every
darkling
copse
showed
thin
and
pale
thinner
and
paler
far
than
those
i
left
in
agony
even
as
pity
seems
to
wear
a
thinner
form
than
fear
not
caged
alone
like
those
the
avenging
furies
purged
were
these
nor
that
dim
land
as
those
black
cavernous
depths
where
no
hope
comes
fair
souls
were
they
and
white
whom
there
i
saw
waiting
as
we
shall
wait
the
beatific
end
but
thin
and
pale
as
the
young
faith
which
made
them
touched
a
little
by
the
sad
memories
of
the
earth
made
glad
a
little
by
past
joys
no
more
and
wrapt
in
musing
on
the
brief
play
played
by
them
upon
the
lively
earth
yet
ignorant
of
the
long
lapse
of
years
and
what
had
been
since
they
too
breathed
life
air
or
if
they
knew
keeping
some
echo
only
but
their
pain
was
fainter
than
their
joy
and
a
great
hope
like
ours
possessed
them
dimly
first
i
saw
a
youth
who
pensive
leaned
against
the
trunk
of
a
dark
cypress
and
an
idle
flute
hung
at
his
side
a
sorrowful
sad
soul
such
as
sometimes
he
knows
who
meets
the
gaze
mute
uncomplaining
yet
most
pitiful
of
one
whom
nature
by
some
secret
spite
has
maimed
and
left
imperfect
or
the
pain
which
fills
a
poet
eyes
beneath
his
robe
i
seemed
to
see
the
scar
of
cruel
stripes
too
hastily
concealed
yet
was
he
not
wholly
unhappy
but
from
out
the
core
of
suffering
flowed
a
secret
spring
of
joy
which
mocked
the
droughts
of
fate
and
left
him
glad
and
glorying
in
his
sorrow
as
i
gazed
he
raised
his
silent
flute
and
half
ashamed
blew
a
soft
note
and
as
i
stayed
awhile
i
heard
him
thus
discourse
the
flute
is
sweet
to
gods
and
men
but
sweeter
far
the
lyre
and
voice
of
a
true
singer
shall
i
fear
to
tell
of
that
great
trial
when
i
strove
and
phoebus
conquered
nay
no
shame
it
is
to
bow
to
an
immortal
melody
but
glory
once
among
the
phrygian
hills
i
lay
while
the
silly
sheep
wandered
among
the
thyme
upon
the
bank
of
a
clear
mountain
stream
beneath
the
pines
safe
hidden
from
the
noon
a
dreamy
haze
played
on
the
uplands
but
the
hills
were
clear
in
sunlight
and
no
cloud
was
on
the
sky
it
was
the
time
when
a
deep
silence
comes
upon
the
summer
earth
and
all
the
birds
have
ceased
from
singing
and
the
world
is
still
as
midnight
and
if
any
live
thing
move
some
creature
or
cool
gliding
snake
within
the
pipy
overgrowth
of
weeds
the
ear
can
catch
the
rustle
and
the
trees
and
earth
and
air
are
listening
as
i
lay
faintly
as
in
a
dream
i
seemed
to
hear
a
tender
music
like
the
æolian
chords
sound
low
within
the
woodland
whence
the
stream
flowed
full
yet
silent
long
with
ear
to
ground
i
hearkened
and
the
sweet
strain
fuller
grown
rounder
and
clearer
came
and
danced
along
in
mirthful
measure
now
and
now
grown
grave
in
dying
falls
and
sweeter
and
more
clear
tripping
at
nuptials
and
high
revelry
wailing
at
burials
rapt
in
soaring
thoughts
chanting
strange
full
of
mystery
touching
all
chords
of
being
and
life
and
death
now
rose
now
sank
and
always
was
divine
so
strange
the
music
came
till
as
i
lay
enraptured
swift
a
sudden
discord
rang
and
all
the
sound
grew
still
a
sudden
flash
as
from
a
sunlit
jewel
fired
the
wood
a
noise
of
water
smitten
and
on
the
hills
a
fair
white
fleece
of
cloud
which
swiftly
climbed
into
the
farthest
heaven
then
as
i
mused
knowing
a
parting
goddess
straight
i
saw
a
sudden
splendour
float
upon
the
stream
and
knew
it
for
this
jewelled
flute
which
paused
before
me
on
an
eddy
it
i
snatched
eager
and
to
my
ardent
lips
i
bore
the
wonder
and
behold
with
the
first
breath
the
first
warm
human
breath
the
silent
strains
the
notes
which
late
the
goddess
blew
revived
and
sounded
clearer
sweeter
far
than
mortal
skill
could
make
so
with
delight
i
left
my
flocks
to
wander
the
wastes
untended
and
the
wolves
and
eagles
seized
the
tender
lambs
but
i
was
for
my
art
nought
else
and
though
the
notes
divine
grew
faint
yet
something
lingered
and
at
last
so
sweet
a
note
i
sounded
of
my
skill
that
all
the
phrygian
highlands
all
the
white
hill
villages
were
fain
to
hear
the
strain
which
the
mad
shepherd
made
so
overbold
and
rapt
in
my
new
art
at
last
i
dared
to
challenge
phoebus
self
was
a
fair
day
when
sudden
on
the
mountain
side
i
saw
a
train
of
fleecy
clouds
in
a
white
band
descending
down
the
gleaming
pinnacles
and
difficult
crags
they
floated
and
the
arch
drawn
with
its
thousand
rays
against
the
sun
hung
like
a
glory
them
midst
the
pines
they
clothed
themselves
with
form
and
straight
i
knew
the
immortals
young
apollo
with
his
lyre
kissed
by
the
sun
and
all
the
muses
clad
in
robes
of
gleaming
white
then
a
great
fear
yet
mixed
with
joy
assailed
me
for
i
knew
myself
a
mortal
equalled
with
the
gods
ah
me
how
fair
they
were
how
fair
and
dread
in
face
and
form
they
showed
when
now
they
came
upon
the
thymy
slope
and
the
young
god
lay
with
his
choir
around
him
beautiful
and
bold
as
youth
and
dawn
there
was
no
cloud
upon
the
sky
nor
any
sound
at
all
when
i
began
my
strain
no
coward
fear
of
what
might
come
restrained
me
but
an
awe
of
those
immortal
eyes
and
ears
divine
looking
and
listening
all
the
earth
seemed
full
of
ears
for
me
alone
the
woods
the
fields
the
hills
the
skies
were
listening
scarce
a
sound
my
flute
might
make
such
subtle
harmonies
the
silence
seemed
to
weave
round
me
and
flout
the
half
unuttered
thought
till
last
i
blew
as
now
a
hesitating
note
and
lo
the
breath
divine
lingering
on
mortal
lips
hurried
my
soul
along
to
such
fair
rhymes
sweeter
than
wont
that
swift
i
knew
my
life
rise
up
within
me
and
expand
and
all
the
human
which
so
nearly
is
divine
was
glorified
and
on
the
muses
lips
and
in
their
lovely
eyes
i
saw
a
fair
approval
and
my
soul
in
me
was
glad
for
all
the
strains
i
blew
were
strains
of
love
love
striving
love
triumphant
love
that
lies
within
belovèd
arms
and
wreathes
his
locks
with
flowers
and
lets
the
world
go
by
and
sings
unheeding
and
i
saw
a
kindly
gleam
within
the
muses
eyes
who
were
indeed
women
though
but
upon
the
face
of
the
young
only
haughty
scorn
sate
and
he
swiftly
struck
his
golden
lyre
and
played
the
song
of
life
and
lo
i
knew
my
strain
how
earthy
oh
to
hear
the
young
apollo
playing
and
the
hidden
cells
and
chambers
of
the
universe
displayed
before
the
charmèd
sound
i
seemed
to
float
in
some
enchanted
cave
where
the
wave
dips
in
from
the
sunlit
sea
and
floods
its
depths
with
reflex
hues
of
heaven
my
soul
was
rapt
by
that
i
heard
and
dared
to
wish
no
more
for
victory
and
yet
because
the
sound
of
music
that
is
born
of
human
breath
comes
straighter
from
the
soul
than
any
strain
the
hand
alone
can
make
therefore
i
knew
with
a
mixed
thrill
of
pity
and
delight
the
nine
immortal
sisters
hardly
touched
by
this
fine
strain
of
music
as
by
mine
and
when
the
high
lay
trembled
to
its
close
still
doubting
then
upon
the
face
there
passed
a
cold
proud
smile
he
swept
his
lyre
once
more
then
laid
it
down
and
with
clear
voice
the
voice
of
godhead
sang
oh
ecstasy
oh
happiness
of
him
who
once
has
heard
apollo
singing
for
his
ears
the
sound
of
grosser
music
dies
and
all
the
earth
is
full
of
subtle
undertones
which
change
the
listener
and
transform
him
as
he
sang
of
what
i
know
not
but
the
music
touched
each
chord
of
being
i
felt
my
secret
life
stand
open
to
it
as
the
parched
earth
yawns
to
drink
the
summer
rain
and
at
the
call
of
those
refreshing
waters
all
my
thought
stir
from
its
dark
and
secret
depths
and
burst
into
sweet
odorous
flowers
and
from
their
wells
deep
call
to
deep
and
all
the
mystery
of
all
that
is
laid
open
as
he
sang
i
saw
the
nine
with
lovely
pitying
eyes
sign
has
conquered
yet
i
felt
no
pang
of
fear
only
deep
joy
that
i
had
heard
such
music
while
i
lived
even
though
it
brought
torture
and
death
for
what
were
it
to
lie
sleek
crowned
with
roses
drinking
vulgar
praise
and
surfeited
with
offerings
the
dull
gift
of
ignorant
hands
all
which
i
might
have
known
to
this
diviner
failure
godlike
is
to
climb
upon
the
icy
ledge
and
fall
where
other
footsteps
dare
not
so
i
knew
my
fate
and
it
was
near
for
to
a
pine
they
bound
me
willing
and
with
cruel
stripes
tore
me
and
took
my
life
but
from
my
blood
was
born
the
stream
of
song
and
on
its
flow
my
poor
flute
to
the
cool
swift
river
borne
floated
and
thence
adown
a
lordlier
tide
into
the
deep
wide
sea
i
do
not
blame
phoebus
or
nature
which
has
set
this
bar
betwixt
success
and
failure
for
i
know
how
far
high
failure
overleaps
the
bound
of
low
successes
only
suffering
draws
the
inner
heart
of
song
and
can
elicit
the
perfumes
of
the
soul
not
enough
to
fail
for
that
were
happiness
to
him
who
ever
upward
looks
with
reverent
eye
and
seeks
but
to
admire
so
since
the
race
of
bards
soars
highest
as
who
seek
to
show
our
lives
as
in
a
glass
therefore
it
comes
that
suffering
weds
with
song
from
him
of
old
who
solaced
his
blank
darkness
with
his
verse
through
all
the
story
of
neglect
and
scorn
necessity
sheer
hunger
early
death
which
smite
the
singer
still
not
only
those
who
keep
clear
accents
of
the
voice
divine
are
honourable
they
are
happy
indeed
the
world
has
held
but
those
who
hear
some
fair
faint
echoes
though
the
crowd
be
deaf
and
see
the
white
gods
garments
on
the
hills
which
the
crowd
sees
not
though
they
may
not
find
fit
music
for
their
thought
they
too
are
blest
not
pitiable
not
from
arrogant
pride
nor
fail
they
who
have
striven
to
tell
what
they
have
heard
with
voice
too
weak
for
such
high
message
more
it
is
than
ease
palace
and
pomp
honours
and
luxuries
to
have
seen
white
presences
upon
the
hills
to
have
heard
the
voices
of
the
eternal
gods
so
spake
he
and
i
seemed
to
look
on
him
whose
sad
young
eyes
grow
on
us
from
the
page
of
his
own
verse
who
did
himself
to
death
or
whom
the
dullard
slew
or
whom
the
sea
rapt
from
us
and
i
passed
without
a
word
slow
grave
with
many
musings
then
i
came
on
one
a
maiden
meek
with
folded
hands
seated
against
a
rugged
face
of
cliff
in
silent
thought
anon
she
raised
her
arms
her
gleaming
arms
above
her
on
the
rock
with
hands
which
clasped
each
other
till
she
showed
as
in
a
statue
and
her
white
robe
fell
down
from
her
maiden
shoulders
and
i
knew
the
fair
form
as
it
seemed
chained
to
the
stone
by
some
invisible
gyves
and
named
her
name
and
then
she
raised
her
frightened
eyes
to
mine
as
one
who
long
expecting
some
great
fear
scarce
sees
deliverance
come
but
when
she
saw
only
a
kindly
glance
a
softer
look
came
in
them
and
she
answered
to
my
thought
with
a
sweet
voice
and
low
i
did
but
muse
upon
the
painful
past
long
dead
and
done
forgetting
i
was
saved
the
angry
clouds
burst
always
on
the
low
flat
plains
and
swept
the
harvest
to
the
ocean
all
the
land
was
wasted
a
great
serpent
from
the
deep
lifting
his
horrible
head
above
their
homes
devoured
the
children
and
the
people
prayed
in
vain
to
careless
gods
on
that
dear
land
which
now
was
turned
into
a
sullen
sea
gazing
in
safety
from
the
stately
towers
of
my
sire
palace
i
a
princess
saw
lapt
in
soft
luxury
within
my
bower
the
wreck
of
humble
homes
come
whirling
by
the
drowning
bleating
flocks
the
bellowing
herds
the
grain
scarce
husbanded
by
toiling
hands
upon
the
sunlit
plain
rush
to
the
sea
with
floating
corpses
on
the
hills
the
remnant
of
the
people
huddled
close
homeless
and
starving
all
my
being
was
filled
with
pity
for
them
and
i
joyed
to
give
what
food
and
shelter
and
compassionate
hands
of
woman
might
i
took
the
little
ones
and
clasped
them
shivering
to
the
virgin
breast
which
knew
no
other
touch
but
theirs
and
gave
raiment
and
food
my
sire
not
stern
to
me
smiled
on
me
as
he
saw
my
gentle
mother
who
loved
me
with
a
closer
love
than
binds
a
mother
to
her
son
and
sunned
herself
in
my
fresh
beauty
seeing
in
my
young
eyes
her
own
fair
vanished
youth
doted
on
me
and
fain
had
kept
my
eyes
from
the
sad
sights
that
pained
them
but
my
heart
was
sad
in
me
seeing
the
ineffable
miseries
of
life
and
that
mysterious
anger
of
the
gods
and
helpless
to
allay
them
all
in
vain
were
prayer
and
supplication
all
in
vain
the
costly
victims
steamed
the
vengeful
clouds
hid
the
fierce
sky
and
still
the
ruin
came
and
wallowing
his
grim
length
within
the
flood
over
the
ravaged
fields
and
homeless
homes
the
fell
raged
sating
his
jaws
with
blood
and
rapine
then
to
the
dread
shrine
of
ammon
went
the
priests
and
reverend
chiefs
of
all
the
nation
white
robed
at
their
head
went
slow
my
royal
sire
the
oracle
spoke
clear
not
as
ofttimes
in
words
obscure
ambiguous
and
as
we
stood
to
meet
the
suppliants
she
who
bare
me
with
her
head
upon
my
neck
we
cheerful
and
with
song
welcomed
their
swift
return
auguring
well
from
such
a
mission
but
my
sire
hid
his
face
from
me
and
the
crowd
of
priests
and
nobles
looked
not
at
us
and
no
word
was
spoken
till
at
last
one
drew
a
scroll
and
gave
it
to
the
queen
who
straightway
swooned
having
read
it
on
my
breast
and
then
i
saw
i
the
young
girl
whose
soft
life
scarcely
knew
shadow
of
sorrow
i
whose
heart
was
full
of
pity
for
the
rest
what
doom
was
mine
i
think
i
hardly
knew
in
that
dread
hour
the
fear
that
came
anon
i
was
transformed
into
a
champion
of
my
race
made
strong
with
a
new
courage
glorying
to
meet
in
all
the
ecstasy
of
sacrifice
death
face
to
face
some
god
i
know
not
who
me
and
despite
my
mother
tears
and
my
stern
father
grief
i
met
my
fate
unshrinking
when
the
moon
rose
clear
from
cloud
once
more
again
over
the
midnight
sea
and
that
vast
watery
plain
where
were
before
hundreds
of
happy
homes
and
fields
and
purple
vineyards
from
my
father
towers
the
white
procession
went
along
the
paths
the
high
cliff
paths
which
well
i
loved
of
old
among
the
myrtles
priests
with
censers
went
and
offerings
robed
in
white
and
round
their
brows
the
sacred
fillet
with
his
nobles
walked
my
sire
with
breaking
heart
my
mother
clung
to
me
the
victim
and
the
young
girls
went
with
wailing
and
with
tears
a
solemn
strain
the
soft
flutes
sounded
as
we
went
by
night
to
a
wild
headland
in
the
sea
there
on
a
rock
upon
the
verge
to
some
rude
stanchions
high
above
my
head
they
bound
me
out
at
sea
a
black
reef
rose
washed
by
the
constant
surge
wherein
a
cave
sheltered
deep
down
the
monster
the
sad
queen
would
scarcely
leave
me
though
the
priests
shrunk
back
in
terror
last
torn
from
my
endless
kiss
swooning
they
bore
her
upwards
all
my
robe
fell
from
my
lifted
arms
and
left
displayed
the
virgin
treasure
of
my
breasts
and
then
the
white
procession
through
the
moonlight
streamed
upwards
and
soon
their
soft
flutes
sounded
low
upon
the
high
lawns
leaving
me
alone
there
stood
i
in
the
moonlight
left
alone
against
the
rock
hardly
i
knew
seeing
only
the
bright
moon
and
summer
sea
which
gently
heaved
and
surged
and
kissed
the
ledge
with
smooth
warm
tides
what
fate
was
mine
i
seemed
soothed
by
the
quiet
to
be
resting
still
within
my
maiden
chamber
and
to
watch
the
moonlight
thro
my
lattice
then
again
fear
came
and
then
the
pride
of
sacrifice
filled
me
as
on
the
high
cliff
lawns
i
heard
the
wailing
cries
the
chanted
liturgies
and
knew
me
bound
forsaken
to
the
rock
and
saw
the
depths
of
sea
so
all
night
long
upon
the
sandy
shores
i
heard
the
hollow
murmur
of
the
wave
and
all
night
long
the
hidden
sea
caves
made
a
ghostly
echo
and
the
sea
birds
mewed
around
me
once
i
heard
a
mocking
laugh
as
of
some
scornful
nereid
once
the
waters
broke
louder
on
the
scarpèd
reefs
and
ebbed
as
if
the
monster
coming
but
again
he
came
not
and
the
dead
moon
sank
and
still
only
upon
the
cliffs
the
wails
the
chants
and
i
forsaken
on
my
rock
and
lo
the
depths
of
sea
till
at
the
dead
dark
hour
before
the
dawn
when
sick
men
die
and
scarcely
fear
itself
bore
up
my
weary
eyelids
a
great
surge
burst
on
the
rock
and
slowly
as
it
seemed
the
sea
sucked
downward
to
its
depths
laid
bare
the
hidden
reefs
and
then
before
my
eyes
oh
horrible
a
huge
and
loathsome
snake
lifted
his
dreadful
crest
and
scaly
side
above
the
wave
in
bulk
and
length
so
large
coil
after
hideous
coil
that
scarce
the
eye
could
measure
its
full
horror
the
great
jaws
dropped
as
with
gore
the
large
and
furious
eyes
were
fired
with
blood
and
lust
nearer
he
came
and
slowly
with
a
devilish
glare
more
near
till
his
hot
foetor
choked
me
and
his
tongue
forked
horribly
within
his
poisonous
jaws
played
around
me
for
awhile
i
swooned
and
when
i
knew
my
life
again
death
bitterness
was
past
then
with
a
bound
leaped
up
the
broad
red
sun
above
the
sea
and
lit
the
horrid
fulgour
of
his
scales
and
struck
upon
the
rock
and
as
i
turned
my
head
in
the
last
agony
of
death
i
knew
a
brilliant
sunbeam
swiftly
leaping
downward
from
crag
to
crag
and
felt
new
hope
where
all
was
hopeless
on
the
hills
a
shout
of
joy
and
on
the
rocks
the
ring
of
mail
and
while
the
hungry
serpent
gloating
eyes
were
fixed
on
me
a
knight
in
casque
of
gold
and
blazing
shield
who
with
his
flashing
blade
fell
on
the
monster
long
the
conflict
raged
till
all
the
rocks
were
red
with
blood
and
slime
and
yet
my
champion
from
those
horrible
jaws
and
dreadful
coils
was
scatheless
zeus
his
sire
protected
and
the
awful
shield
he
bore
withered
the
monster
life
and
left
him
cold
dragging
his
helpless
length
and
grovelling
crest
and
his
glaring
eyes
the
films
of
death
crept
and
his
writhing
flank
and
hiss
of
hate
the
great
deep
swallowed
down
and
blood
and
spume
rose
on
the
waves
and
a
strange
wailing
cry
resounded
the
waters
and
the
sea
bellowed
within
its
caves
then
knew
i
i
was
saved
and
with
me
all
the
people
from
my
wrists
he
loosed
the
gyves
my
hero
and
within
his
godlike
arms
bore
me
by
slippery
rock
and
difficult
path
to
where
my
mother
prayed
there
was
no
need
to
ask
my
love
without
a
spoken
word
love
lit
his
fires
within
me
my
young
heart
went
forth
love
calling
and
i
gave
him
all
dost
thou
then
wonder
that
the
memory
of
this
supreme
brief
moment
lingers
still
while
all
the
happy
uneventful
years
of
wedded
life
and
all
the
fair
young
growth
of
offspring
and
the
tranquil
later
joys
nay
even
the
fierce
eventful
fight
which
raged
when
we
were
wedded
fade
and
are
deceased
lost
in
the
irrecoverable
past
nay
is
not
strange
always
the
memory
of
overwhelming
perils
or
great
joys
avoided
or
enjoyed
writes
its
own
trace
with
such
deep
characters
upon
our
lives
that
all
the
rest
are
blotted
in
this
place
where
is
not
action
thought
or
count
of
time
it
is
not
weary
as
it
were
on
earth
to
dwell
on
these
old
memories
time
is
born
of
dawns
and
sunsets
days
that
wax
and
wane
and
stamp
themselves
upon
the
yielding
face
of
fleeting
human
life
but
here
there
is
morning
nor
evening
act
nor
suffering
but
only
one
unchanging
present
holds
our
being
suspended
one
blest
day
indeed
or
centuries
ago
or
yesterday
there
came
among
us
one
who
was
divine
not
as
our
gods
joyous
and
breathing
strength
and
careless
life
but
crowned
with
a
new
crown
of
suffering
and
a
great
light
came
with
him
and
with
him
he
brought
time
and
a
new
sense
of
dim
years
and
since
he
passed
i
seem
to
see
new
meaning
in
my
fate
and
all
the
deeds
i
tell
of
evermore
the
young
life
comes
bound
to
the
cruel
rocks
alone
before
it
the
unfathomed
sea
smiles
filled
with
monstrous
growths
that
wait
to
take
its
innocence
far
off
the
voice
and
hand
of
love
kneel
by
in
agony
and
entreat
the
seeming
careless
gods
still
when
the
deep
is
smoothest
lo
the
deadly
fangs
and
coils
lurk
near
to
smite
with
death
and
the
crags
of
duty
like
a
sudden
sunbeam
springs
some
golden
soul
half
mortal
half
divine
and
breaks
the
chain
and
evermore
for
sacrifice
they
die
through
sacrifice
they
live
and
are
for
others
and
no
grief
which
smites
the
humblest
but
reverberates
thro
all
the
files
of
life
and
takes
the
princely
soul
that
from
its
royal
towers
looks
down
and
sees
the
sorrow
sir
farewell
if
thou
shouldst
meet
my
children
on
the
earth
or
here
for
maybe
it
is
long
ago
since
i
and
they
were
living
say
to
them
i
only
muse
a
little
here
and
wait
the
waking
and
her
lifted
arms
sank
down
upon
her
knees
and
as
i
passed
i
saw
her
gazing
with
soft
rapt
eyes
and
on
her
lips
a
smile
as
of
a
saint
and
then
i
saw
a
manly
hunter
pace
along
the
lea
his
bow
upon
his
shoulder
and
his
spear
poised
idly
in
his
hand
the
face
and
form
of
vigorous
youth
but
in
the
full
brown
eyes
a
timorous
gaze
as
of
a
hunted
hart
yet
human
still
even
as
the
faun
of
old
the
dumb
brute
passing
into
man
and
dowered
with
double
nature
as
he
came
i
seemed
to
question
of
his
fate
and
he
answered
me
thus
was
one
hot
afternoon
that
i
a
hunter
wearied
with
my
day
heard
my
hounds
baying
fainter
on
the
hills
led
by
the
flying
hart
and
when
the
sound
faded
and
all
was
still
i
turned
to
seek
by
heat
and
thirst
a
little
glade
beloved
of
old
where
in
the
shadowy
wood
the
clear
cold
crystal
of
a
mossy
pool
lipped
the
soft
emerald
marge
and
gave
again
the
lawn
where
ofttimes
overspent
i
lay
upon
the
grass
and
careless
bathed
my
limbs
in
the
sweet
lymph
but
as
i
neared
the
hollow
sudden
through
the
leaves
i
saw
a
throng
of
fair
sporting
undraped
round
one
a
goddess
she
with
timid
hand
loosened
her
zone
and
glancing
round
let
fall
her
robe
from
neck
and
bosom
pure
and
bright
for
it
was
dian
self
i
saw
none
else
as
when
she
frees
her
from
a
fleece
of
cloud
and
swims
along
the
deep
blue
sea
of
heaven
on
sweet
june
nights
silent
awhile
i
stood
rooted
with
awe
and
fain
had
turned
to
fly
but
feared
by
careless
footstep
to
affright
those
chaste
cold
eyes
great
awe
and
reverence
held
me
and
fear
then
love
with
passing
wing
fanned
me
and
held
my
eyes
and
checked
my
breath
signing
so
for
a
time
i
watched
breathless
as
one
a
brooding
nightmare
holds
who
fleeth
some
great
fear
yet
fleeth
not
till
the
last
flutter
of
lawn
and
veil
no
more
obscured
and
all
the
beauty
of
my
dreams
assailed
my
sense
but
ere
i
raised
my
eyes
as
one
who
fain
would
look
and
see
the
sun
the
first
glance
dazed
my
brain
only
i
knew
the
perfect
outline
flow
in
tender
curves
to
break
in
doubled
charms
only
a
haze
of
creamy
white
dimple
and
deep
divine
and
then
no
more
for
lo
a
sudden
chill
and
such
thick
mist
as
shuts
the
hills
at
eve
oppressed
me
gazing
and
a
shame
an
awe
a
fear
a
reverence
for
the
unknown
froze
all
the
springs
of
will
and
left
me
cold
and
blinded
all
the
longings
of
my
eyes
leaving
such
dim
reflection
still
as
mocks
him
who
has
looked
on
a
great
light
and
keeps
on
his
closed
eyes
the
image
presently
my
fainting
soul
safe
hidden
for
awhile
deep
in
life
mystic
shades
renewed
herself
and
straight
the
innocent
brute
within
the
man
bore
on
me
and
with
eye
i
gazed
upon
the
secret
as
i
looked
a
radiance
white
as
beamed
the
frosty
moon
on
the
mad
boy
and
slew
him
beamed
on
me
made
chill
my
pulses
checked
my
life
and
heat
transformed
me
withered
all
my
soul
and
left
my
being
burnt
out
for
lo
the
dreadful
eyes
of
godhead
met
my
gaze
and
through
the
mask
and
thick
disguise
of
sense
as
through
a
wood
pierced
to
my
life
then
suddenly
i
knew
an
altered
nature
touched
by
no
desire
for
that
which
showed
so
lovely
but
declined
to
lower
levels
nought
of
fear
or
awe
nothing
of
love
was
mine
i
gazed
but
saw
no
spiritual
beam
to
blight
my
brain
with
too
much
beauty
no
undraped
and
awful
majesty
only
a
brute
dumb
charm
like
that
which
draws
the
brute
to
it
unknowing
it
is
drawn
so
gradually
i
knew
a
dull
content
my
sense
and
unabashed
i
gazed
like
that
dumb
bird
which
thinks
no
thought
and
speaks
no
word
yet
fronts
the
sun
that
blinded
homer
all
my
fear
sunk
with
my
shame
in
a
base
happiness
but
as
i
gazed
and
careless
turned
and
passed
through
the
thick
wood
forgetting
what
had
been
and
thinking
thoughts
no
longer
swift
there
came
a
mortal
terror
voices
that
i
knew
my
own
hounds
bayings
that
i
loved
before
as
with
them
often
the
purple
hills
i
chased
the
flying
hart
from
slope
to
slope
before
the
slow
sun
climbed
the
eastern
peaks
until
the
swift
sun
smote
the
western
plain
whom
often
i
had
cheered
by
voice
and
glance
whom
often
i
had
checked
with
hand
and
thong
grim
followers
like
the
passions
firing
me
true
servants
like
the
strong
nerves
urging
me
on
many
a
fruitless
chase
to
find
and
take
some
too
beauty
faithful
feet
and
tongues
obedient
always
these
i
knew
clothed
with
a
force
and
vaster
grown
and
stronger
than
their
master
and
i
thought
what
if
they
tare
me
with
their
jaws
nor
knew
that
once
i
ruled
them
brute
pursuing
brute
and
i
the
quarry
then
i
turned
and
fled
if
it
was
i
indeed
that
feared
and
fled
down
the
long
glades
and
through
the
tangled
brakes
where
scarce
the
sunlight
pierced
fled
on
and
on
and
panted
but
evermore
the
dissonant
music
which
i
knew
so
sweet
when
by
the
windy
hills
the
echoing
vales
and
whispering
pines
it
rang
now
far
now
near
as
from
my
rushing
steed
i
leant
and
cheered
with
voice
and
horn
the
chase
this
brought
to
me
fear
of
i
knew
not
what
which
bade
me
fly
fly
always
fly
but
when
my
heart
stood
still
and
all
my
limbs
were
stiffened
as
i
fled
just
as
the
white
moon
climbed
the
sky
nearer
they
came
and
nearer
baying
loud
with
bloodshot
eyes
and
red
jaws
dripping
foam
and
when
i
strove
to
check
their
savagery
speaking
with
words
no
voice
articulate
came
only
a
dumb
low
bleat
then
all
the
throng
leapt
swift
on
me
and
tare
me
as
i
lay
and
left
me
man
again
wherefore
i
walk
along
these
dim
fields
peopled
with
the
ghosts
of
heroes
who
have
left
the
ways
of
earth
for
this
faint
ghost
of
them
sometimes
i
think
pondering
on
what
has
been
that
all
my
days
were
shadows
all
my
life
an
allegory
and
though
i
know
sometimes
some
fainter
gleam
of
the
old
beauty
move
me
and
sometimes
some
beat
of
the
old
pulses
that
my
fate
for
ever
hurrying
on
in
hot
pursuit
to
fall
at
length
was
but
a
tale
writ
large
by
zeus
upon
a
mortal
life
writ
large
and
yet
a
riddle
for
sometimes
i
read
its
meaning
thus
life
is
a
chase
and
man
the
hunter
always
following
on
with
hounds
of
rushing
thought
or
fiery
sense
some
hidden
truth
or
beauty
fleeting
still
for
ever
through
the
coverts
deep
and
wolds
of
time
and
if
he
turn
a
moment
from
the
hot
pursuit
to
seize
some
sweetness
other
than
the
search
to
which
his
soul
is
set
some
dalliance
some
outward
shape
of
art
some
lower
love
some
charm
of
wealth
and
sleek
content
and
home
then
if
he
check
an
instant
the
swift
chase
of
fierce
untempered
energies
which
pursue
with
jaws
unsated
and
a
thirst
for
act
bears
down
on
him
with
clanging
shock
and
whelms
his
prize
and
him
in
ruin
and
sometimes
i
seem
to
myself
a
thinker
who
at
last
amid
the
chase
and
capture
of
low
ends
pausing
by
some
cold
well
of
hidden
thought
comes
on
some
perfect
truth
and
looks
and
looks
till
the
fair
vision
blinds
him
and
the
sum
of
all
his
lower
self
pursuing
him
the
strong
brute
forces
the
unchecked
desires
finding
him
bound
and
speechless
deem
him
now
no
more
their
master
but
some
soulless
thing
and
leap
on
him
and
seize
him
and
possess
his
life
till
through
death
gate
he
pass
to
life
and
his
own
ghost
revives
but
looks
no
more
upon
the
truth
unveiled
save
through
a
cloud
of
creed
and
faith
and
longing
which
shall
change
one
day
to
perfect
knowledge
but
shall
read
the
riddle
of
my
life
i
walk
in
this
dim
land
amid
dim
ghosts
of
kings
as
one
day
thou
shalt
meantime
fare
thou
well
then
passed
he
and
i
marked
him
slowly
go
along
the
winding
ways
of
that
weird
land
and
vanish
in
a
wood
and
next
i
knew
a
woman
perfect
as
a
young
man
dream
and
breathing
as
it
seemed
the
old
sweet
air
of
the
fair
days
of
old
when
man
was
young
and
life
an
epic
round
the
lips
a
smile
subtle
and
deep
and
sweet
as
hers
who
looks
from
the
old
painter
canvas
and
derides
life
and
the
riddle
of
things
the
aimless
strife
the
folly
of
love
as
who
has
proved
it
all
enjoyed
and
suffered
in
the
lovely
eyes
a
weary
look
no
other
than
the
gaze
which
ofttimes
as
the
rapid
chariot
whirls
and
ofttimes
by
the
glaring
midnight
streets
gleams
out
and
chills
our
thought
and
yet
not
guilt
nor
sorrow
was
it
only
weariness
no
more
and
still
most
lovely
as
i
named
her
name
in
haste
she
looked
with
half
surprise
and
thus
she
seemed
to
speak
what
dost
thou
know
thou
too
the
fatal
glances
which
beguiled
those
strong
rude
chiefs
of
old
has
not
the
gloom
of
this
dim
land
withdrawn
from
out
mine
eyes
the
glamour
which
once
filled
them
does
my
cheek
retain
the
round
of
youth
and
still
defy
the
wear
of
immemorial
centuries
and
this
low
voice
long
silent
keeps
it
still
the
music
of
old
time
aye
in
thine
eyes
i
read
it
and
within
thine
eyes
i
see
thou
knowest
me
and
the
story
of
my
life
sung
by
the
blind
old
bard
when
i
was
dead
and
all
my
lovers
dust
i
know
thee
not
thee
nor
thy
gods
yet
would
i
soothly
swear
i
was
not
all
to
blame
for
what
has
been
the
long
fight
the
swift
death
the
woes
the
tears
the
brave
lives
spent
the
humble
homes
uptorn
to
gain
one
poor
fair
face
it
was
not
i
that
curved
these
lips
into
this
subtle
smile
or
gave
these
eyes
their
fire
nor
yet
made
round
this
supple
frame
it
was
not
i
but
love
love
mirroring
himself
in
all
things
fair
love
that
projects
himself
upon
a
life
and
dotes
on
his
own
image
ah
the
days
the
weary
years
of
love
and
feasts
and
gold
the
hurried
flights
the
din
of
clattering
hoofs
at
midnight
when
the
heroes
dared
for
me
and
bore
me
the
hills
the
swift
pursuits
baffled
and
lost
or
when
from
isle
to
isle
the
galley
spread
its
wings
and
rose
over
the
swelling
surges
and
i
saw
time
after
time
the
scarce
familiar
town
the
hills
the
palaces
the
gleaming
temples
fade
and
all
for
me
me
the
dead
prize
the
shell
the
soulless
ghost
the
husk
of
a
true
woman
the
fond
words
wasted
on
careless
ears
that
seemed
to
hear
of
love
to
me
unloving
the
rich
feasts
the
silken
dalliance
and
soft
luxury
the
fair
observance
and
high
reverence
for
me
who
cared
not
to
whatever
land
my
kingly
lover
snatched
me
i
have
known
how
small
a
fence
love
sets
between
the
king
and
the
strong
hind
who
breeds
his
brood
and
dies
upon
the
field
he
tills
i
have
exchanged
people
for
people
crown
for
glittering
crown
through
every
change
a
queen
and
held
my
state
hateful
and
sickened
in
my
soul
to
lie
stretched
on
soft
cushions
to
the
lutes
low
sound
while
on
the
wasted
fields
the
clang
of
arms
rang
and
the
foemen
perished
and
swift
death
hunger
and
plague
and
every
phase
of
woe
vexed
all
the
land
for
me
i
have
heard
the
curse
unspoken
when
the
wife
widowed
for
me
clasped
to
her
heart
her
orphans
starved
for
me
as
i
swept
proudly
by
i
have
prayed
the
gods
hating
my
own
fair
face
which
wrought
such
woe
some
plague
divine
might
light
on
it
and
leave
my
curse
a
ruin
yet
i
think
indeed
they
had
not
cursed
but
pitied
those
true
wives
who
mourned
their
humble
lords
and
straining
felt
the
innocent
thrill
which
swells
the
mother
heart
who
clasps
her
growing
boy
had
they
but
known
the
lifeless
life
the
pain
of
hypocrite
smiles
the
dead
load
of
caresses
simulated
when
love
stands
shuddering
by
to
see
his
fires
lit
for
the
shrine
of
gold
what
if
they
felt
the
weariness
of
loveless
love
which
grew
and
through
the
jealous
palace
portals
seized
the
caged
unloving
woman
sick
of
toys
sick
of
her
gilded
chains
her
ease
herself
till
for
sheer
weariness
she
flew
to
meet
some
new
unloved
seducer
what
if
they
knew
no
childish
loving
hands
or
worse
than
all
had
borne
them
sullen
to
a
sire
unloved
and
left
them
without
pain
i
might
have
been
i
too
a
loving
mother
and
chaste
wife
had
fate
so
willed
for
i
remember
well
how
one
day
straying
from
my
father
halls
seeking
anemones
and
violets
a
girl
in
when
the
heart
makes
spring
within
the
budding
bosom
that
i
came
of
a
sudden
through
a
wood
upon
a
bay
a
little
sunny
bay
whose
banks
sloped
gently
downward
to
the
yellow
sand
where
the
blue
wave
creamed
soft
with
fairy
foam
and
oft
the
nereids
sported
as
i
strayed
singing
with
violets
in
my
hair
and
bosom
and
my
hands
were
full
of
flowers
i
came
upon
a
little
lamb
and
took
it
in
my
arms
and
fondled
it
and
wreathed
its
neck
with
flowers
and
sang
to
it
and
kissed
it
and
the
spring
was
in
my
life
and
i
was
glad
and
when
i
raised
my
eyes
behold
a
youthful
shepherd
with
his
crook
stood
by
me
and
regarded
as
i
lay
tall
fair
with
clustering
curls
and
front
that
wore
a
budding
manhood
as
i
looked
a
fear
came
me
lest
he
were
some
youthful
god
disguised
in
shape
of
man
so
fair
he
was
but
when
he
spoke
the
kindly
face
was
full
of
manhood
and
the
large
eyes
full
of
fire
drew
me
without
a
word
and
all
the
flowers
fell
from
me
and
the
little
lamb
strayed
through
the
brake
and
took
with
it
the
white
fair
years
of
childhood
time
fulfilled
my
being
with
passion
like
a
cup
and
with
one
kiss
left
me
a
woman
ah
the
lovely
days
when
on
the
warm
bank
crowned
with
flowers
we
sate
and
thought
no
harm
and
his
thin
reed
pipe
made
low
music
and
no
witness
of
our
love
intruded
but
the
tinkle
of
the
flock
came
from
the
hill
and
the
odorous
shade
we
dreamed
away
the
day
and
watched
the
waves
steal
shoreward
and
beyond
the
sylvan
capes
the
innumerable
laughter
of
the
sea
ah
youth
and
love
so
passed
the
happy
days
till
twilight
and
i
stole
as
in
a
dream
homeward
and
lived
as
in
a
happy
dream
and
when
they
spoke
answered
as
in
a
dream
and
through
the
darkness
saw
as
in
a
glass
the
happy
happy
day
and
thrilled
and
glowed
and
kept
my
love
in
sleep
and
longed
for
dawn
and
scarcely
stayed
for
hunger
and
with
morn
stole
eager
to
the
little
wood
and
fed
my
life
with
kisses
ah
the
joyous
days
of
innocence
when
love
was
queen
in
heaven
and
nature
unreproved
break
they
then
still
those
azure
circles
on
a
golden
shore
smiles
there
no
glade
upon
the
older
earth
where
spite
of
all
gray
wisdom
and
new
gods
young
lovers
dream
within
each
other
arms
silent
by
shadowy
grove
or
sunlit
sea
ah
days
too
fair
to
last
there
came
a
night
when
i
lay
longing
for
my
love
and
knew
sudden
the
clang
of
hoofs
the
broken
doors
the
clash
of
swords
the
shouts
the
groans
the
stain
of
red
upon
the
marble
the
fixed
gaze
of
dead
and
dying
eyes
that
was
the
time
when
first
i
looked
on
death
and
when
i
woke
from
my
deep
swoon
i
felt
the
night
air
cool
upon
my
brow
and
the
cold
stars
look
down
as
swift
we
galloped
the
darkling
plain
and
saw
the
chill
sea
glimpses
slowly
wake
with
arms
unknown
around
me
when
the
dawn
broke
swift
we
panted
on
the
pathless
steeps
and
so
by
plain
and
mountain
till
we
came
to
athens
where
they
kept
me
till
i
grew
fairer
with
every
year
and
many
wooed
heroes
and
chieftains
but
i
loved
not
one
and
then
the
avengers
came
and
snatched
me
back
to
sparta
all
the
dark
chiefs
of
argos
wooed
me
striving
king
with
king
for
one
fair
foolish
face
nor
knew
i
kept
no
heart
to
give
them
yet
since
i
was
grown
weary
of
honeyed
words
and
suit
of
love
i
wedded
a
brave
chief
dauntless
and
true
but
what
cared
i
i
could
not
prize
at
all
his
honest
service
i
had
grown
so
tired
of
loving
and
of
love
that
when
they
brought
news
that
the
fairest
shepherd
on
the
hills
having
done
himself
to
death
for
his
lost
love
lay
like
a
lovely
statue
cold
and
white
upon
the
golden
sand
i
hardly
knew
more
than
a
passing
pang
love
like
a
flower
love
springing
up
too
tall
in
a
young
breast
the
growth
of
morning
life
too
scorching
sun
had
withered
long
ere
noon
love
like
a
flame
on
his
own
altar
offering
up
my
heart
had
burnt
my
being
to
ashes
was
it
love
that
drew
me
then
to
paris
he
was
fair
i
grant
you
fairer
than
a
summer
morn
fair
with
a
woman
fairness
yet
in
arms
a
hero
but
he
never
had
my
heart
not
love
for
him
allured
me
but
the
thirst
for
freedom
if
in
more
than
thought
i
erred
and
was
not
rapt
but
willing
for
my
child
born
to
an
unloved
father
loved
me
not
the
fresh
sea
called
the
galleys
plunged
and
i
fled
willing
from
my
prison
and
the
pain
of
undesired
caresses
and
the
wind
was
fair
and
on
the
third
day
as
we
sailed
my
heart
was
glad
within
me
when
i
saw
the
towers
of
ilium
rise
beyond
the
wave
ah
the
long
years
the
melancholy
years
the
miserable
melancholy
years
for
soon
the
new
grew
old
and
then
i
grew
weary
of
him
of
all
of
pomp
and
state
and
novel
splendour
yet
at
times
i
knew
some
thrill
of
pride
within
me
as
i
saw
from
those
high
walls
a
prisoner
and
a
foe
the
swift
ships
flock
at
anchor
in
the
bay
the
hasty
landing
and
the
flash
of
arms
the
lines
of
royal
tents
upon
the
plain
the
gates
the
chivalry
within
issuing
in
all
its
pride
to
meet
the
shock
of
the
bold
chiefs
without
so
year
by
year
the
haughty
challenge
from
the
warring
hosts
rang
forth
and
i
with
a
divided
heart
saw
victory
incline
now
here
now
there
and
helpless
marked
the
argive
chiefs
i
knew
the
spouse
i
left
the
princely
loves
of
old
now
with
each
other
strive
and
now
with
troy
the
brave
pomp
of
the
morn
the
fair
strong
limbs
the
glittering
panoply
the
bold
young
hearts
athirst
for
fame
of
war
and
with
the
night
the
broken
spear
the
shattered
helm
the
plume
dyed
red
with
blood
the
ghastly
dying
face
and
nerveless
limbs
laid
lifeless
and
i
knew
the
stainless
hector
whom
i
could
have
loved
but
that
a
happy
love
made
blind
his
eyes
to
all
my
baleful
beauty
fallen
and
dragged
his
noble
manly
head
upon
the
sand
by
young
achilles
chariot
him
in
turn
fallen
and
slain
my
fair
false
paris
slain
plague
famine
battle
raging
now
within
and
now
without
for
many
a
weary
year
summer
and
winter
till
i
loathed
to
live
who
was
indeed
as
well
they
said
the
hell
of
men
and
fleets
and
cities
as
i
stood
upon
the
walls
ofttimes
a
longing
came
looking
on
rage
and
fight
and
blood
and
death
to
end
it
all
and
dash
me
down
and
die
but
no
god
helped
me
nay
one
day
i
mind
i
would
entreat
them
you
lords
be
men
what
fatal
charm
is
this
which
até
gives
to
one
poor
foolish
face
be
strong
and
turn
in
peace
forget
this
glamour
get
you
home
with
all
your
fleets
and
armies
to
the
land
i
love
no
longer
where
your
faithful
wives
pine
widowed
of
their
lords
and
your
young
boys
grow
wild
to
manhood
i
have
nought
to
give
no
heart
nor
prize
of
love
for
any
man
nor
recompense
i
am
the
ghost
alone
of
the
fair
girl
ye
knew
she
still
abides
if
she
still
lives
and
is
not
wholly
dead
stretched
on
a
flowery
bank
upon
the
sea
in
fair
heroic
argos
leave
this
form
that
is
no
other
than
the
outward
shell
of
a
once
loving
woman
as
i
spake
my
pity
fired
my
eyes
and
flushed
my
cheek
with
some
soft
charm
and
as
i
spread
my
hands
the
purple
glancing
down
a
little
left
the
marble
of
my
breasts
and
one
pink
bud
upon
the
gleaming
snows
and
as
i
looked
with
a
mixed
pride
and
terror
i
beheld
the
brute
rise
up
within
them
and
my
words
fall
barren
on
them
so
i
sat
apart
nor
ever
more
looked
forth
while
every
day
brought
its
own
woe
the
melancholy
years
the
miserable
melancholy
years
crept
onward
till
the
midnight
terror
came
and
by
the
glare
of
burning
streets
i
saw
palace
and
temple
reel
in
ruin
and
fall
and
the
legions
bursting
in
by
gate
and
bastion
blunted
sword
and
spear
with
unresisted
slaughter
from
my
tower
i
saw
the
good
old
king
his
kindly
eyes
in
agony
and
all
his
reverend
hairs
dabbled
with
blood
as
the
fierce
foeman
thrust
and
stabbed
him
as
he
lay
the
youths
the
girls
whom
day
by
day
i
knew
their
silken
ease
and
royal
luxury
changed
for
blood
and
tears
haled
forth
to
death
or
worse
then
a
great
hate
of
life
and
fate
seized
on
me
and
i
rose
and
rushed
among
them
crying
is
i
i
who
have
brought
this
evil
kill
me
kill
the
fury
that
is
i
yet
is
not
i
and
let
my
soul
go
outward
through
the
wound
made
clean
by
blood
to
hades
let
me
die
not
these
who
did
no
wrong
but
not
a
hand
was
raised
and
all
shrank
backward
as
afraid
as
from
a
goddess
then
i
swooned
and
fell
and
knew
no
more
and
when
i
woke
i
felt
my
husband
arms
around
me
and
the
wind
blew
fair
for
greece
and
the
beaked
galley
plunged
and
where
the
towers
of
ilium
rose
of
old
a
pall
of
smoke
above
a
glare
of
fire
what
then
in
the
near
future
ten
long
years
bring
youth
and
love
to
that
deep
when
the
full
noisy
current
of
our
lives
creeps
dumb
through
wealth
of
flowers
i
think
i
knew
somewhat
of
peace
at
last
with
my
good
lord
who
loved
too
much
to
palter
with
the
past
flushed
with
the
present
young
hermione
had
grown
from
child
to
woman
she
was
wed
and
was
not
i
her
mother
at
the
pomp
of
solemn
nuptials
and
requited
love
i
prayed
she
might
be
happy
happier
far
than
ever
i
was
so
in
tranquil
ease
i
lived
a
queen
long
time
and
because
wealth
and
high
observance
can
make
sweet
our
days
when
youth
swift
joy
is
past
i
did
requite
with
what
i
might
not
love
the
kindly
care
of
him
i
loved
not
pomps
and
robes
of
price
and
chariots
held
me
but
when
fate
cut
short
his
life
and
love
his
sons
who
were
not
mine
reigned
in
his
stead
and
hated
me
and
mine
and
knowing
i
was
friendless
i
sailed
forth
once
more
across
the
sea
seeking
for
rest
and
shelter
still
i
knew
that
in
my
eyes
love
dwelt
and
all
the
baleful
charm
of
old
burned
as
of
yore
scarce
dimmed
as
yet
by
time
i
saw
it
in
the
mirror
of
the
sea
i
saw
it
in
the
youthful
seamen
eyes
and
was
half
proud
again
i
had
such
power
who
now
kept
nothing
else
so
one
calm
eve
behold
a
sweet
fair
isle
blushed
like
a
rose
upon
the
summer
sea
there
my
swift
ship
cast
anchor
and
they
told
me
it
was
rhodes
there
in
a
little
wood
above
the
sea
like
that
dear
wood
of
yore
i
wandered
forth
forlorn
and
all
my
seamen
were
apart
and
i
alone
when
at
the
close
of
day
i
knew
myself
surrounded
by
strange
churls
with
angry
eyes
and
one
who
ordered
them
a
woman
whom
i
knew
not
but
who
walked
in
mien
and
garb
a
queen
she
with
the
fire
of
hate
within
her
eyes
bind
her
men
i
know
her
bind
her
fast
then
to
the
trunk
of
a
tall
plane
they
bound
me
with
rude
cords
that
cut
my
arms
and
meantime
far
below
the
sun
was
gilding
fair
with
dying
rays
isle
after
isle
and
purple
wastes
of
sea
and
then
she
signed
to
them
and
all
withdrew
among
the
woods
and
left
us
face
to
face
two
women
ere
i
spoke
know
she
said
know
that
evil
fairness
this
it
was
or
ever
he
had
come
across
my
life
that
made
him
cold
to
me
who
had
my
love
and
left
me
half
a
heart
if
all
my
life
of
wedlock
was
but
half
a
life
what
fiend
came
my
love
and
me
but
that
fair
face
what
left
his
children
orphans
but
that
face
and
me
a
widow
fiend
i
have
thee
now
thou
hast
not
long
to
live
i
will
requite
thy
murders
yet
oh
fiend
that
art
so
fair
were
it
not
haply
better
to
deface
thy
fatal
loveliness
and
leave
thee
bare
of
all
thy
baleful
power
and
yet
i
doubt
and
looking
on
thy
face
i
doubt
the
more
lest
all
thy
dower
of
fairness
be
the
gift
of
aphrodité
and
i
fear
to
fight
against
the
immortal
gods
even
with
the
word
and
she
relenting
all
the
riddle
of
life
flashed
through
me
and
the
inextricable
coil
of
being
and
the
immeasurable
depths
and
irony
of
fate
burst
on
my
thought
and
left
me
smiling
in
the
eyes
of
death
with
this
deep
smile
thou
seëst
then
with
a
shriek
the
woman
leapt
on
me
and
with
blind
rage
strangled
my
life
and
when
she
had
done
the
deed
she
swooned
and
those
her
followers
hasting
back
fell
prone
upon
their
knees
before
the
corpse
as
to
a
goddess
then
one
went
and
brought
a
sculptor
and
within
a
jewelled
shrine
they
set
me
in
white
marble
bound
to
a
tree
of
marble
and
they
came
and
knelt
to
me
young
men
and
maidens
through
the
secular
years
while
the
old
gods
bore
sway
but
i
was
here
and
now
they
kneel
no
longer
for
the
world
has
gone
from
beauty
but
i
think
indeed
they
well
might
worship
still
for
never
yet
was
any
thought
or
thing
of
beauty
born
except
with
suffering
that
poor
wretch
who
thought
i
injured
her
stealing
the
foolish
heart
which
she
prized
but
i
could
not
what
knew
she
of
that
i
suffered
she
had
loved
her
love
though
unrequited
and
had
borne
to
him
children
who
loved
her
what
if
she
had
been
loved
yet
unloving
all
the
fire
of
love
burnt
out
before
love
time
in
one
brief
blaze
of
passion
ah
poor
fool
i
pity
her
being
blest
and
yet
unthankful
and
forgive
now
that
she
is
a
ghost
as
i
the
hand
which
loosed
my
load
of
life
for
scarce
indeed
could
any
god
who
cares
for
mortal
men
have
ever
kept
me
happy
i
had
tired
of
simple
loving
doubtless
as
i
tired
of
splendour
and
being
loved
there
be
some
souls
for
which
love
is
enough
content
to
bear
from
youth
to
age
from
chesnut
locks
to
gray
the
load
of
common
uneventful
life
and
penury
but
i
was
not
of
these
i
know
not
now
if
it
were
best
indeed
that
i
had
reared
my
simple
shepherd
brood
and
lived
and
died
unknown
in
some
poor
hut
among
the
argive
hills
or
lived
a
queen
as
i
did
knowing
every
day
that
dawned
some
high
emprise
and
glorious
and
in
death
to
fill
the
world
with
song
not
the
same
meed
the
gods
mete
out
for
all
or
she
the
dread
necessity
who
rules
both
gods
and
men
some
to
dishonour
some
to
honour
moulds
to
happiness
some
some
to
unhappiness
we
are
what
zeus
has
made
us
discords
playing
in
the
great
music
but
the
harmony
is
sweeter
for
them
and
the
great
spheres
ring
in
one
accordant
hymn
but
thou
if
there
come
a
daughter
of
thy
love
oh
pray
to
all
thy
gods
lest
haply
they
should
mar
her
life
with
too
great
beauty
so
she
ceased
the
fairest
woman
that
the
poet
dream
or
artist
hand
has
fashioned
all
the
gloom
seemed
lightened
round
her
and
i
heard
the
sound
of
her
melodious
voice
when
all
was
still
and
the
dim
twilight
took
her
next
there
came
two
who
together
walked
one
with
a
lyre
of
gold
which
gave
no
sound
the
other
hung
upon
his
breast
and
closely
clung
to
him
spent
in
a
tender
longing
as
they
came
i
heard
her
gentle
voice
recounting
some
ancient
tale
and
these
the
words
she
said
dear
voice
and
lyre
now
silent
which
i
heard
across
yon
sullen
river
bringing
to
me
all
my
old
life
and
he
the
ferryman
heard
and
obeyed
and
the
grim
monster
heard
and
fawned
on
you
joyous
thou
and
free
like
a
white
sunbeam
from
the
dear
bright
earth
where
suns
shone
clear
and
moons
beamed
bright
and
streams
laughed
with
a
rippling
music
nor
as
here
the
dumb
stream
stole
the
veiled
sky
slept
the
fields
were
lost
in
twilight
like
a
morning
breeze
which
blows
in
summer
from
the
gates
of
dawn
across
the
fields
of
spice
and
wakes
to
life
their
slumbering
perfume
through
this
silent
land
of
whispering
voices
and
of
eyes
where
scarce
a
footstep
sounds
nor
any
strain
of
earthly
song
thou
and
suddenly
the
pale
cheeks
flushed
a
little
the
murmured
words
rose
to
a
faint
thin
treble
the
throng
of
ghosts
pacing
along
the
sunless
ways
and
still
felt
a
new
life
thou
camest
dear
and
straight
the
dull
cold
river
broke
in
sparkling
foam
the
pale
and
scentless
flowers
grew
perfumed
last
to
the
dim
chamber
where
with
the
sad
queen
i
sat
in
gloom
and
silently
inwove
dead
wreaths
of
amaranths
thy
music
came
laden
with
life
and
i
who
seemed
to
know
not
life
voice
only
but
my
own
rose
up
along
the
hollow
pathways
following
the
sound
which
brought
back
earth
and
life
and
love
and
memory
and
longing
yet
i
went
with
footsteps
as
of
one
whom
passion
draws
or
some
high
fantasy
despite
himself
because
some
subtle
spell
part
born
of
dread
to
cross
that
sullen
stream
and
its
grim
guardians
part
of
secret
shame
of
the
young
airs
and
freshness
of
the
earth
being
that
i
was
enchained
me
then
at
last
from
voice
and
lyre
so
high
a
strain
arose
as
trembled
on
the
utter
verge
of
being
and
thrilling
poured
out
life
thus
closelier
drawn
i
walked
with
thee
shut
in
by
halcyon
sound
and
soft
environments
of
harmony
beyond
the
ghostly
gates
beyond
the
dim
calm
fields
where
the
beetle
hummed
and
the
pale
owl
stole
noiseless
from
the
copse
and
the
white
blooms
stretched
thin
for
lack
of
sun
so
fair
a
light
born
out
of
consonant
sound
environed
me
nor
looked
i
backward
as
we
seemed
to
move
to
some
high
goal
of
thought
and
life
and
love
like
twin
birds
flying
fast
with
equal
wing
out
of
the
night
to
meet
the
coming
sun
above
a
sea
but
on
thy
dear
fair
eyes
the
eyes
that
well
i
knew
on
the
old
earth
i
looked
not
for
with
still
averted
gaze
thou
leddest
and
i
followed
for
indeed
while
that
high
strain
was
sounding
i
was
rapt
in
faith
and
a
high
courage
driving
out
all
doubt
and
discontent
and
womanish
fear
nay
even
my
love
itself
but
when
awhile
it
sank
a
little
or
seemed
to
sink
and
fall
to
lower
levels
seeing
that
use
makes
blunt
the
too
accustomed
ear
straightway
desire
to
look
once
more
on
thy
recovered
eyes
seized
me
and
oft
i
called
with
piteous
voice
beseeching
thee
to
turn
but
thou
long
time
wert
even
as
one
unmindful
with
grave
sign
and
waving
hand
denying
finally
when
now
we
neared
the
stream
on
whose
far
shore
lay
life
great
terror
took
me
and
i
shrieked
thy
name
as
in
despair
then
thou
as
one
who
knows
him
set
in
some
great
jeopardy
a
swift
death
fronting
him
on
either
hand
didst
slowly
turning
gaze
and
lo
i
saw
thine
eyes
grown
awful
life
that
looked
on
death
clear
purity
on
dark
and
cankered
sin
the
immortal
on
corruption
not
the
eyes
that
erst
i
knew
in
life
but
dreadfuller
and
stranger
as
i
looked
i
seemed
to
swoon
some
blind
force
whirled
me
back
and
when
i
woke
i
saw
thee
vanish
in
the
middle
stream
a
speck
on
the
dull
waters
taking
with
thee
my
life
and
leaving
love
with
me
but
i
not
for
myself
bewail
but
all
for
thee
who
but
for
me
wert
now
among
the
stars
with
thy
great
lord
i
sitting
at
thy
feet
but
now
the
fierce
and
unrestrainèd
rout
of
passions
finding
thee
scornful
of
love
within
thy
lonely
cell
with
blind
rage
falling
on
thee
tore
thy
limbs
and
left
them
to
the
muses
sepulture
while
thy
soul
dwells
in
hades
but
i
wail
my
weakness
always
who
for
love
destroyed
the
life
that
was
my
love
i
prithee
dear
forgive
me
if
thou
canst
who
hast
lost
heaven
to
save
a
loving
woman
he
with
voice
sweeter
than
any
mortal
melody
and
plaintive
as
the
music
that
is
made
by
the
æolian
strings
or
the
sad
bird
that
sings
of
summer
nights
eurydice
dear
love
be
comforted
not
once
alone
that
which
thou
mournest
is
but
day
by
day
some
lonely
soul
which
walks
apart
and
feeds
on
high
hill
pastures
far
from
herds
of
men
comes
to
the
low
fat
fields
and
sunny
vales
joyous
with
fruits
and
flowers
and
the
white
arms
of
laughing
love
and
there
awhile
he
stays
content
forgetting
all
the
joys
he
knew
when
first
the
morning
broke
upon
the
hills
and
the
keen
air
breathed
from
the
eastern
gates
like
a
pure
draught
of
wine
forgetting
all
the
strains
which
float
as
from
a
nearer
heaven
to
him
who
treads
at
dawn
the
untrodden
snows
while
all
the
warm
world
sleeps
forgetting
these
and
all
things
that
have
been
and
if
he
gain
to
raise
to
his
own
heights
the
simpler
souls
that
dwell
upon
the
plains
the
untutored
thought
the
museless
lives
the
unawakened
brain
that
yet
might
soar
then
is
he
blest
indeed
but
if
he
fail
then
leaving
love
behind
the
wider
love
of
the
race
the
closer
love
of
some
congenial
soul
he
turns
again
to
the
old
difficult
steeps
and
there
alone
pines
till
the
widowed
passions
of
his
heart
tear
him
and
rend
his
soul
and
drive
him
down
to
the
low
plains
he
left
and
there
he
dwells
missing
the
heavens
dear
and
the
white
peaks
and
the
light
air
of
old
but
in
their
stead
finding
the
soft
sweet
sun
of
the
vale
the
clouds
which
veil
the
skies
indeed
but
give
the
rains
that
feed
the
streams
of
life
and
make
earth
green
and
bring
at
last
the
harvest
so
i
walk
in
this
dim
land
content
with
thee
o
love
untouched
by
any
yearning
of
regret
for
those
old
days
nor
that
the
lyre
which
made
erewhile
such
potent
music
now
is
dumb
nor
that
the
voice
that
once
could
move
the
earth
zeus
speaking
through
it
speaks
in
household
words
of
homely
love
love
is
enough
for
me
with
thee
o
dearest
and
perchance
at
last
zeus
willing
this
dumb
lyre
and
whispered
voice
shall
wake
by
love
inspired
to
such
clear
note
as
soars
above
the
stars
and
swelling
lifts
our
souls
to
highest
heaven
then
he
stooped
and
folded
in
one
long
embrace
they
went
and
faded
and
i
cried
oh
strong
god
love
mightier
than
death
and
hell
and
then
i
chanced
on
a
fair
woman
whose
sad
eyes
were
full
of
a
fixed
like
his
who
knows
himself
the
fountain
of
his
grief
and
pines
in
sorrow
as
i
spake
enquiring
of
her
grief
she
answered
thus
stranger
thou
seest
of
all
the
shades
below
the
most
unhappy
others
sought
their
love
in
death
and
found
it
dying
but
for
me
the
death
that
took
me
took
from
me
my
love
and
left
me
comfortless
no
load
i
bear
like
those
dark
wicked
women
who
have
slain
their
lords
for
lust
or
anger
whom
the
dread
propitious
ones
within
the
pit
below
punish
and
purge
of
sin
only
unfaith
if
haply
want
of
faith
be
not
a
crime
blacker
than
murder
when
we
fail
to
trust
one
worthy
of
all
faith
and
folly
bring
no
harder
recompense
than
comes
of
scorn
and
loathing
of
itself
ah
fool
fool
fool
who
didst
mistrust
thy
love
who
was
the
best
and
truest
manliest
soul
with
whom
the
gods
have
ever
blest
the
earth
so
brave
so
strong
fired
with
such
burning
hate
of
powerful
ill
so
loving
of
the
race
so
swift
to
raise
the
fearless
arm
and
mighty
club
and
smite
all
monstrous
growths
with
ruin
zeus
himself
showed
scarce
more
mighty
and
yet
was
the
while
a
very
man
not
cast
in
mould
too
fine
for
human
love
but
ofttimes
snared
and
caught
by
womanish
wiles
fast
held
within
the
net
his
passions
wove
oh
it
was
grand
to
hear
of
how
he
went
the
champion
of
his
race
mighty
in
war
mighty
in
love
now
bent
to
more
than
human
tasks
now
lapt
in
ease
now
suffering
now
enjoying
strong
vast
soul
tuned
to
heroic
deeds
and
set
on
high
above
the
range
of
common
petty
sins
too
high
to
mate
with
an
unequal
soul
too
full
of
striving
for
contented
days
ah
me
how
well
i
do
recall
the
cause
of
all
our
ills
i
was
a
happy
bride
when
that
dark
até
which
pursues
the
steps
of
heroes
innocent
drove
us
to
exile
and
i
joyed
to
be
his
own
and
share
his
pain
to
a
swift
stream
fleeing
we
came
where
a
rough
ferryman
waited
more
brute
than
man
my
hero
plunged
in
those
fierce
depths
and
battled
with
their
flow
and
with
great
labour
gained
the
strand
and
bade
the
monster
row
me
to
him
but
with
lust
and
brutal
cunning
in
his
eyes
the
thing
seized
me
and
turned
to
fly
with
me
when
swift
an
arrow
hissed
from
the
unerring
bow
pierced
him
and
loosed
his
grasp
then
as
his
eyes
grew
glazed
in
death
there
came
in
them
a
gleam
of
what
i
know
was
hate
and
he
said
this
white
robe
it
is
costly
see
my
blood
has
stained
it
but
a
little
i
did
wrong
i
know
it
and
repent
me
if
there
come
a
time
when
he
grows
cold
for
all
the
race
of
heroes
wander
nor
can
any
love
fix
theirs
for
long
take
it
and
wrap
him
in
it
and
he
shall
love
again
then
from
the
strange
deep
look
within
his
eyes
i
shrank
in
fear
and
left
him
half
in
pity
and
i
went
to
meet
my
lord
who
rose
from
that
fierce
stream
fair
as
a
god
ah
me
the
weary
days
we
women
live
spending
our
anxious
souls
consumed
with
jealous
fancies
hungering
still
for
the
belovèd
voice
and
ear
and
eye
and
hungering
all
in
vain
for
life
is
more
to
youthful
manhood
than
to
sit
at
home
before
the
hearth
to
watch
the
children
ways
and
lead
the
life
of
petty
household
care
which
doth
content
us
women
day
by
day
i
pined
in
trachis
for
my
love
while
he
now
in
some
warlike
exploit
busied
now
fighting
some
monster
now
at
some
fair
court
resting
awhile
till
some
new
enterprise
called
him
returned
not
news
of
treacheries
avenged
friends
succoured
dreadful
monsters
slain
came
from
him
always
triumph
always
fame
and
honour
and
success
and
reverence
and
sometimes
words
of
love
for
me
who
pined
for
more
than
words
and
would
have
gone
to
him
but
that
the
toils
of
such
high
errantry
asked
more
than
woman
strength
so
the
slow
years
vexed
me
alone
in
trachis
set
forlorn
in
solitude
nor
hearing
at
the
gate
the
frank
and
cheering
voice
nor
on
the
stair
the
heavy
tread
nor
feeling
the
strong
arm
around
me
in
the
darkling
night
when
all
my
being
ran
slow
last
subtle
whispers
came
of
womanish
wiles
which
kept
my
lord
from
me
and
one
who
young
and
fair
a
life
and
virgin
younger
fairer
far
than
i
when
first
he
loved
me
held
him
in
the
toils
of
scarce
dissembled
love
not
easily
might
i
believe
this
evil
but
at
last
the
malice
finding
me
forlorn
and
sitting
at
my
ear
possessed
me
and
the
fire
of
jealous
love
raged
through
my
veins
not
turned
as
yet
to
hate
too
well
i
loved
for
that
but
breeding
in
me
unfaith
in
him
love
setting
him
so
high
and
self
so
low
betrayed
me
and
i
prayed
constrained
to
hold
him
false
the
immortal
gods
to
make
him
love
again
but
still
he
came
not
and
still
the
maddening
rumours
worked
and
still
young
and
a
king
daughter
the
same
words
smote
me
and
pierced
me
oh
there
is
no
pain
in
hades
nay
nor
deepest
hell
itself
like
that
of
jealous
hearts
the
which
racked
my
life
so
long
till
one
fair
morn
there
came
a
joyful
message
has
come
and
at
the
shrine
upon
the
promontory
the
fair
white
shrine
upon
the
purple
sea
he
waits
to
do
his
solemn
sacrifice
to
the
immortal
gods
and
with
him
comes
a
young
maid
beautiful
as
dawn
then
i
mingling
despair
with
love
rapt
in
deep
joy
that
he
was
come
plunged
in
the
depths
of
hell
that
she
came
too
bethought
me
of
the
robe
the
centaur
gave
me
and
the
words
he
spake
forgetting
the
deep
hatred
in
his
eyes
and
all
but
love
and
sent
a
messenger
bidding
him
wear
it
for
the
sacrifice
to
the
immortals
knowing
not
at
all
whom
fate
decreed
the
victim
shall
my
soul
forget
the
agonized
message
which
he
sent
bidding
me
come
for
that
accursèd
robe
stained
with
the
poisonous
accursèd
blood
even
in
the
midmost
flush
of
sacrifice
clung
to
him
a
devouring
fire
and
ate
the
piteous
flesh
from
his
dear
limbs
and
stung
his
great
soft
soul
to
madness
when
i
came
knowing
it
was
my
work
he
bent
on
me
wise
as
a
god
through
suffering
and
the
near
inevitable
death
so
that
no
word
of
mine
was
needed
such
a
tender
look
of
mild
reproach
as
smote
me
not
thou
trust
me
who
never
loved
as
i
love
thee
what
need
was
there
of
magical
arts
to
draw
the
love
that
never
wavered
i
have
lived
as
he
lives
who
through
perilous
paths
must
pass
and
lifelong
trials
striving
to
keep
down
the
brute
within
him
born
of
too
much
strength
and
sloth
and
vacuous
days
by
difficult
toils
labours
endured
and
fights
with
ill
now
vanquished
now
triumphant
and
sometimes
in
intervals
of
too
long
labour
finding
his
nature
grown
too
strong
for
him
falls
prone
awhile
a
helpless
prey
then
once
again
rises
and
spurns
his
chains
and
fares
anew
along
the
perilous
ways
dearest
i
would
that
thou
wert
wedded
to
some
knight
who
stayed
at
home
within
thy
gates
and
were
content
to
see
thee
happy
but
for
me
the
fierce
rude
energies
of
life
the
mighty
thews
the
hate
of
wrong
these
drove
me
forth
to
quench
the
thirst
of
battle
see
this
maid
this
is
the
bride
i
destined
for
our
son
who
grows
to
manhood
do
thou
see
to
her
when
i
am
dead
for
soon
i
know
again
the
frenzy
comes
and
with
it
ceasing
death
go
therefore
ere
i
harm
thee
when
my
strength
has
lost
its
guidance
thou
wert
rich
in
love
be
now
as
rich
in
faith
dear
for
thy
wrong
i
do
forgive
thee
when
i
saw
the
glare
of
madness
fire
his
eyes
and
my
ears
heard
the
groans
the
torture
wrung
from
his
great
soul
i
fled
with
broken
heart
to
the
white
shrine
and
knelt
in
prayer
but
still
my
sad
ear
took
the
agony
of
his
cries
then
i
who
knew
there
was
no
hope
in
god
or
man
for
me
who
had
destroyed
my
love
and
with
him
slain
the
champion
of
the
suffering
race
of
men
and
knowing
that
my
soul
though
innocent
of
blood
was
guilty
of
unfaith
and
vile
mistrust
and
wrapt
in
weakness
like
a
cloak
and
made
the
innocent
tool
of
hate
and
wrong
against
all
love
and
good
grown
sick
and
filled
with
hatred
of
myself
rose
from
my
knees
and
went
a
little
space
apart
and
found
a
gnarled
tree
on
the
cliff
and
with
my
scarf
strangling
myself
swung
lifeless
but
in
death
i
found
him
not
for
building
a
vast
pile
of
scented
woods
on
oeta
as
they
tell
my
hero
with
his
own
hand
lighted
it
and
when
the
mighty
pyre
flamed
far
and
wide
over
all
lands
and
seas
he
climbed
on
it
and
laid
him
down
to
die
but
pitying
zeus
before
the
swift
flames
reached
him
in
a
cloud
descending
snatched
the
strong
brave
soul
to
heaven
and
set
him
mid
the
stars
wherefore
am
i
of
all
the
blameless
shades
within
this
place
the
most
unhappy
if
of
blame
indeed
i
bear
no
load
for
what
is
sin
itself
but
error
when
we
miss
the
road
which
leads
up
to
the
gate
of
heaven
ignorance
what
if
we
be
the
cause
of
ignorance
being
blind
who
might
have
seen
yet
do
i
know
but
pain
nor
stain
there
is
upon
my
soul
such
as
they
bear
who
know
the
dreadful
scourge
with
which
the
stern
judge
still
lashes
their
sins
i
am
forgiven
i
know
who
loved
so
much
and
one
day
if
zeus
will
i
shall
go
free
from
hence
and
join
my
lord
and
be
with
him
again
and
straight
i
seemed
passing
to
look
upon
some
life
which
knows
the
irony
of
fate
in
pain
together
clung
the
ghosts
whom
next
i
saw
bound
three
in
one
by
some
invisible
bond
a
sire
of
port
as
zeus
to
whom
on
either
hand
a
tender
stripling
clung
i
knew
them
well
as
all
men
know
them
one
fair
youth
spake
low
father
it
does
not
pain
me
now
to
be
drawn
close
to
thee
and
by
a
double
bond
with
this
my
brother
and
the
other
nay
nor
me
o
father
but
i
bless
the
chain
which
binds
our
souls
in
union
if
some
trace
of
pain
still
linger
heed
it
not
is
past
still
let
us
cling
to
thee
he
with
grave
eyes
full
of
great
tenderness
upon
his
sons
looked
with
the
father
gaze
that
is
so
far
more
sweet
and
sad
and
tender
than
the
gaze
of
mothers
now
on
this
one
now
on
that
regarding
them
dear
sons
whom
on
the
earth
i
loved
and
cherished
it
was
hard
to
watch
your
pain
but
now
is
finished
and
we
stand
for
ever
through
all
future
days
of
time
symbols
of
patient
suffering
undeserved
endured
and
vanquished
yet
sad
memory
still
brings
back
our
time
of
trial
for
the
day
broke
fair
when
i
the
dread
poseidon
priest
joyous
because
the
unholy
strife
was
done
and
seeing
the
blue
waters
now
left
free
of
hostile
keels
save
where
upon
the
verge
far
off
the
white
sails
faded
rose
at
dawn
and
white
robed
and
in
garb
of
sacrifice
and
with
the
sacred
fillet
round
my
brows
stood
at
the
altar
and
behind
ye
twain
decked
by
your
mother
hand
with
robes
and
with
fresh
chaplets
on
your
curls
attended
and
your
clear
young
voices
made
music
that
touched
your
father
eyes
with
tears
if
not
the
careless
gods
i
seem
to
hear
those
high
sweet
accents
mounting
in
the
hymn
which
rose
to
all
the
blessed
gods
who
dwelt
upon
the
far
olympus
zeus
the
lord
and
sovereign
heré
and
the
immortal
choir
of
deities
but
chiefly
to
the
dread
poseidon
him
who
sways
the
purple
sea
as
with
a
sceptre
shaking
the
fixed
earth
with
stress
of
thundering
surges
by
the
shrine
the
victim
for
the
sacrifice
stood
with
his
gilded
horns
the
hymns
were
done
and
i
in
act
to
strike
when
all
the
crowd
who
knelt
behind
us
with
a
common
fear
cried
with
a
cry
that
well
might
freeze
the
blood
and
then
with
fearful
glances
towards
the
sea
fled
leaving
us
alone
me
the
high
priest
and
ye
the
acolytes
forlorn
of
men
alone
but
with
our
god
but
we
stirred
not
we
could
not
flee
who
in
the
solemn
act
of
worship
and
the
ecstasy
which
comes
to
the
believer
soul
saw
heaven
revealed
the
mysteries
unveiled
the
inner
sky
which
meets
the
enraptured
gaze
how
should
we
fear
who
thus
were
so
we
stood
while
the
long
ritual
spent
itself
nor
cast
an
eye
upon
the
sea
till
as
i
came
to
that
great
act
which
offers
up
a
life
before
life
lord
and
the
full
mystery
was
trembling
to
completion
quick
i
heard
a
stifled
cry
of
agony
and
knew
my
children
voices
and
the
father
heart
which
is
far
more
than
rite
or
service
done
by
man
for
god
seeing
that
it
is
divine
and
comes
from
god
to
men
this
rising
in
me
constrained
me
and
i
ceased
my
prayer
and
turned
to
succour
you
and
lo
the
awful
coils
which
crushed
your
lives
already
bound
me
round
and
crushed
me
also
as
you
clung
to
me
in
common
death
some
god
had
heard
the
prayer
and
lo
we
were
ourselves
the
sacrifice
the
priest
the
victim
the
accepted
life
the
blood
the
pain
the
salutary
loss
was
it
not
better
thus
to
cease
and
die
together
in
one
blest
moment
mid
the
flush
and
ecstasy
of
worship
and
to
know
ourselves
the
victims
they
were
wrong
who
taught
that
was
some
jealous
goddess
who
destroyed
our
lives
revengeful
for
discovered
wiles
or
hateful
of
our
land
not
readily
should
such
base
passions
sway
the
immortal
gods
but
rather
do
i
hold
it
sooth
indeed
that
zeus
himself
it
was
who
pitying
the
ruin
he
foreknew
yet
might
not
stay
since
mightier
fate
decreed
it
sent
in
haste
those
dreadful
messengers
and
bade
them
take
the
pious
lives
he
loved
before
the
din
of
midnight
slaughter
woke
and
the
fair
town
flamed
pitifully
to
the
skies
and
all
was
blood
and
ruin
surely
it
was
best
to
die
as
we
did
and
in
death
to
live
a
vision
for
all
ages
of
high
pain
which
passes
into
beauty
and
is
merged
in
one
accordant
whole
as
discords
merge
in
that
great
harmony
which
ceaseless
rings
from
the
tense
chords
of
life
than
to
have
lived
our
separate
lives
and
died
our
separate
deaths
and
left
no
greater
mark
than
drops
which
rain
upon
the
unbounded
sea
those
hosts
which
fell
before
the
scæan
gate
upon
the
sand
nor
found
a
bard
to
sing
their
fate
but
left
their
bones
to
dogs
and
kites
were
they
more
blest
than
we
who
in
the
people
sight
before
ilium
unshattered
towers
lay
down
to
die
our
swift
miraculous
death
dear
sons
and
good
dear
children
of
my
love
how
doubly
dear
for
this
our
common
sorrow
suffering
weaves
not
only
chains
of
darkness
round
but
binds
a
golden
glittering
link
which
though
withdrawn
or
felt
no
longer
knits
us
soul
to
soul
in
indissoluble
bonds
and
draws
our
lives
so
close
that
though
the
individual
life
be
merged
there
springs
a
common
life
which
grows
to
such
dread
beauty
as
has
power
to
take
the
sting
from
sorrow
and
transform
the
pain
into
transcendent
joy
as
from
the
storm
the
unearthly
rainbow
draws
its
myriad
hues
and
steeps
the
world
in
fairness
all
our
lives
are
notes
that
fade
and
sink
and
so
are
merged
in
the
full
harmony
of
being
dear
sons
cling
closer
to
me
life
nor
death
has
torn
our
lives
asunder
as
for
some
but
drawn
their
separate
strands
together
in
a
knot
closer
than
life
itself
stronger
than
death
insoluble
as
fate
then
they
three
clung
together
the
strong
father
and
young
sons
and
in
their
loving
eyes
i
saw
the
pain
fade
into
joy
suffering
in
beauty
lost
and
death
in
love
by
a
still
sullen
pool
into
its
dark
depths
gazing
lay
the
ghost
whom
next
i
passed
in
form
a
lovely
youth
scarce
passed
from
boyhood
golden
curls
were
his
and
wide
blue
eyes
the
semblance
of
a
smile
came
on
his
lip
a
girl
but
for
the
down
which
hardly
shaded
it
but
the
pale
cheek
was
soft
as
any
maiden
and
his
robe
was
virginal
and
at
his
breast
he
bore
the
perfumed
amber
cup
which
when
march
comes
gems
the
dry
woods
and
windy
wolds
and
speaks
the
resurrection
looking
up
he
said
methought
i
saw
her
then
my
love
my
fair
my
beauty
my
ideal
the
dim
clouds
lifted
methought
a
little
or
was
it
fond
fancy
only
for
i
know
that
here
no
sunbeam
cleaves
the
twilight
but
a
mist
creeps
over
all
the
sky
and
fields
and
pools
and
blots
them
and
i
know
i
seek
in
vain
my
beauty
nor
can
fancy
bring
an
answer
to
my
thought
from
these
blind
depths
and
unawakened
skies
yet
has
use
made
the
quest
so
precious
that
i
keep
it
here
well
knowing
it
is
vain
on
the
old
earth
otherwise
when
in
fair
thessaly
i
walked
regardless
of
all
nymphs
who
sought
my
love
but
sought
in
vain
whether
it
were
dryad
or
naiad
from
the
woods
or
streams
or
oread
fleeting
on
the
side
of
fair
olympus
echoing
back
my
sighs
in
vain
for
through
the
mountains
day
by
day
i
wandered
and
along
the
foaming
brooks
and
by
the
dry
and
never
took
a
thought
for
love
nor
ever
the
throng
of
loving
nymphs
who
knew
me
beautiful
i
dallied
unregarding
till
they
said
some
died
for
love
of
me
who
loved
not
one
and
yet
i
cared
not
wandering
still
alone
amid
the
mountains
by
the
scented
pines
till
one
fair
day
when
all
the
hills
were
still
nor
any
breeze
made
murmur
through
the
boughs
nor
cloud
was
on
the
heavens
i
wandered
slow
leaving
the
nymphs
who
fain
with
dance
and
song
had
kept
me
the
glades
and
strayed
away
among
the
pines
enwrapt
in
fantasy
and
by
the
beechen
dells
which
clothe
the
feet
of
fair
olympus
wrapt
in
fantasy
weaving
the
thin
and
unembodied
shapes
which
fancy
loves
to
body
forth
and
leave
in
marble
or
in
song
and
so
strayed
down
to
a
low
sheltered
vale
above
the
plains
where
the
lush
grass
grew
thick
and
the
stream
stayed
its
garrulous
tongue
and
last
upon
the
bank
of
a
still
pool
i
came
where
was
no
flow
of
water
but
the
depths
were
clear
as
air
and
nothing
but
the
silvery
gleaming
side
of
tiny
fishes
stirred
there
lay
i
down
upon
the
flowery
bank
and
scanned
the
deep
half
in
a
waking
dream
then
swift
there
rose
from
those
enchanted
depths
a
face
more
fair
than
ever
i
had
dreamt
of
and
i
knew
my
sweet
ideal
the
thick
curls
like
these
were
golden
and
the
white
robe
showed
like
this
but
for
the
wondrous
eyes
and
lips
the
tender
loving
glance
the
sunny
smile
upon
the
rosy
mouth
these
knew
i
not
not
even
in
dreams
and
yet
i
seemed
to
trace
myself
within
them
too
as
who
should
find
his
former
self
expunged
and
him
transformed
to
some
high
thin
ideal
separate
from
what
he
was
by
some
invisible
bar
and
yet
the
same
in
difference
as
i
moved
my
arms
to
clasp
her
to
me
lo
she
moved
her
eager
arms
to
mine
smiled
to
my
smile
looked
love
to
love
and
answered
longing
eyes
with
longing
when
my
full
heart
burst
in
words
i
love
thee
lo
the
lovely
lips
i
love
thee
sighed
and
through
the
air
the
echo
rang
but
when
i
longed
to
answer
kiss
with
kiss
and
stooped
my
lips
to
her
sweet
lips
in
that
long
thrill
which
strains
soul
unto
soul
the
cold
lymph
came
between
and
chilled
our
love
and
kept
us
separate
souls
which
fain
would
mingle
and
the
heaven
rose
a
blue
vault
above
us
and
no
shade
of
earthly
thing
obscured
us
as
we
lay
two
reflex
souls
one
and
yet
different
two
sundered
souls
longing
to
be
at
one
there
all
day
long
until
the
light
was
gone
and
took
my
love
away
i
lay
and
loved
the
image
and
when
night
was
come
i
whispered
and
she
whispered
back
with
oh
such
yearning
many
a
day
we
spent
by
that
clear
pool
together
all
day
long
and
many
a
clouded
hour
on
the
wet
grass
i
lay
beneath
the
rain
and
saw
her
not
and
sickened
for
her
and
sometimes
the
pool
was
thick
with
flood
and
hid
her
and
sometimes
some
cold
wind
ruffled
those
clear
wells
and
left
but
glimpses
of
her
and
i
rose
at
eve
unsatisfied
a
cold
chill
in
my
limbs
and
fever
at
my
heart
until
too
soon
the
summer
faded
and
the
skies
were
hid
and
my
love
came
not
but
a
quenchless
thirst
wasted
my
life
and
all
the
winter
long
the
bright
sun
shone
not
or
the
thick
ribbed
ice
obscured
her
and
i
pined
for
her
and
knew
my
life
ebb
from
me
till
i
grew
too
weak
to
seek
her
fearing
i
should
see
no
more
my
dear
and
so
the
long
dead
winter
waned
and
the
slow
spring
came
back
and
one
blithe
day
when
life
was
in
the
woods
and
the
birds
sang
and
soft
airs
fanned
the
hills
i
knew
again
some
gleam
of
hope
within
me
and
again
with
feeble
limbs
crawled
forth
and
felt
the
spring
blossom
within
me
and
the
glades
the
bursting
trees
the
building
nests
the
songs
the
hurry
of
life
revived
me
and
i
crept
amid
the
joy
until
i
flung
my
panting
frame
and
weary
nerveless
limbs
down
by
the
cold
still
pool
and
lo
i
saw
my
love
once
more
not
beauteous
as
of
old
but
oh
how
changed
the
fair
young
cheek
grown
pale
the
great
eyes
larger
than
of
yore
gaze
forth
with
a
sad
yearning
look
and
a
great
pain
and
pity
took
me
which
were
more
than
love
and
with
a
loud
and
wailing
voice
i
cried
i
come
again
i
pine
for
thee
and
swift
she
answered
back
pine
for
thee
to
me
oh
my
own
i
cried
and
she
to
me
oh
my
own
then
with
a
cry
of
love
i
joined
myself
to
her
and
plunged
beneath
the
icy
surface
with
a
kiss
and
fainted
and
am
here
and
now
indeed
i
know
not
if
it
was
myself
i
sought
as
some
tell
or
another
for
i
hold
that
what
we
seek
is
but
our
other
self
other
and
higher
neither
wholly
like
nor
wholly
different
the
the
gods
retained
when
half
was
given
one
the
man
and
one
the
woman
and
i
longed
to
round
the
imperfect
essence
by
its
complement
for
only
thus
the
perfect
life
stands
forth
whole
worse
it
is
to
live
than
imperfect
and
to
move
from
a
false
centre
not
a
perfect
sphere
but
with
a
crooked
bias
sent
oblique
athwart
life
furrows
was
myself
indeed
thus
only
that
i
sought
that
lovers
use
to
see
in
that
they
love
not
that
which
is
but
that
their
fancy
feigns
and
view
themselves
reflected
in
their
love
yet
glorified
and
finer
and
more
pure
wherefore
it
is
all
love
which
finds
its
own
ideal
mate
is
happy
happy
that
which
gives
itself
unto
itself
and
keeps
through
long
calm
years
the
tranquil
image
in
its
eyes
and
knows
fulfilment
and
is
blest
and
day
by
day
wears
love
like
a
white
flower
nor
holds
it
less
though
sharp
winds
bite
or
hot
suns
fade
or
age
sully
its
perfect
whiteness
but
inhales
its
fragrance
and
is
glad
but
happier
still
he
who
long
seeks
a
high
goal
unattained
and
wearies
for
it
all
his
days
nor
knows
possession
sate
his
thirst
but
still
pursues
the
fleeting
loveliness
now
seen
now
lost
but
evermore
grown
fairer
till
at
last
he
stretches
forth
his
arms
and
takes
the
fair
in
one
long
rapture
and
its
name
is
death
thus
he
and
seeing
me
stand
grave
farewell
if
ever
thou
shouldst
happen
on
a
wood
in
thessaly
upon
the
spurs
of
fair
olympus
take
the
path
which
winds
through
the
close
vale
and
thou
shalt
see
the
pool
where
once
i
found
my
life
and
if
in
spring
thou
go
there
round
the
margin
thou
shalt
know
these
amber
blooms
bend
meekly
smiling
down
upon
the
crystal
surface
pluck
them
not
but
kneel
a
little
while
and
breathe
a
prayer
to
the
fair
god
of
love
and
let
them
be
for
in
those
tender
flowers
is
hid
the
life
that
once
was
mine
all
things
are
bound
in
one
in
earth
and
heaven
nor
is
there
any
gulf
things
that
live
the
flower
that
was
a
life
the
life
that
is
a
flower
but
one
sure
chain
binds
all
as
now
i
know
if
there
are
still
fair
oreads
on
the
hills
say
to
them
sir
they
must
no
longer
pine
for
me
but
find
some
worthier
lover
who
can
love
again
for
i
have
found
my
love
and
to
the
pool
he
turned
and
gazed
with
lovely
eyes
and
showed
fair
as
an
angel
leaving
him
enwrapt
in
musings
to
a
gloomy
pass
i
came
between
dark
rocks
where
scarce
a
gleam
of
light
not
even
the
niggard
light
of
that
dim
land
might
enter
and
the
soil
was
black
and
bare
nor
even
the
thin
growths
which
scarcely
clothed
the
higher
fields
might
live
hard
by
a
cave
which
sloped
down
steeply
to
the
lowest
depths
whence
dreadful
sounds
ascended
seated
still
her
head
upon
her
hands
i
saw
a
maid
with
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
not
tartarus
it
was
but
hades
and
she
knew
no
pain
except
her
painful
thought
yet
there
it
seemed
as
here
the
unequal
measure
which
awaits
the
adjustment
and
meanwhile
inspires
the
strife
which
rears
life
palace
walls
and
fills
the
sail
which
bears
our
bark
across
unfathomed
seas
to
its
last
harbour
this
bore
sway
there
too
and
was
a
luckless
shade
which
sat
and
wept
amid
the
gloom
though
blameless
suddenly
she
raised
her
head
and
lo
the
long
curls
writhed
tangled
and
as
the
dripping
hair
of
a
dead
girl
who
freed
from
life
and
shame
from
out
the
cruel
wintry
flow
is
laid
stark
on
the
snow
with
dreadful
staring
eyes
like
hers
for
when
she
raised
her
eyes
to
mine
they
chilled
my
blood
so
great
a
woe
they
bore
and
as
she
gazed
i
knew
my
pulse
beat
slow
and
my
limbs
stiffen
then
they
wore
at
length
a
softer
look
and
life
revived
within
my
breast
as
thus
she
softly
spoke
nay
friend
i
would
not
harm
thee
i
have
known
great
sorrow
and
sometimes
it
racks
me
still
and
turns
me
into
stone
and
makes
my
eyes
as
dreadful
as
of
yore
and
yet
it
comes
but
seldom
as
thou
sawest
now
for
time
and
death
have
healing
hands
only
i
love
to
sit
within
the
darkness
here
nor
face
the
throng
of
happier
ghosts
if
any
ghost
of
happiness
come
here
for
on
the
earth
they
wronged
me
bitterly
and
turned
to
stone
my
heart
till
scarce
i
knew
if
i
was
the
happy
girl
of
yore
that
youth
who
dreams
up
yonder
by
the
margin
of
the
lake
knew
but
a
cold
ideal
love
but
me
love
in
unearthly
guise
but
bodily
form
seized
and
betrayed
i
was
a
priestess
once
of
stern
athené
doing
day
by
day
due
worship
raising
every
dawn
that
came
my
cold
pure
hymns
to
take
her
virgin
ear
nor
sporting
with
the
joyous
company
of
youths
and
maids
who
at
the
neighbouring
shrine
of
aphrodité
served
nor
dance
nor
song
allured
me
nor
the
pleasant
days
of
youth
and
twilights
the
vines
they
held
me
cold
who
were
my
friends
in
childhood
for
my
soul
was
virginal
and
at
the
virgin
shrine
i
knelt
athirst
for
knowledge
day
by
day
the
long
cold
ritual
sped
the
liturgies
were
done
the
barren
hymns
of
praise
went
up
before
the
goddess
and
the
ecstasy
of
faith
possessed
me
wholly
till
almost
i
knew
not
i
was
woman
yet
i
knew
that
i
was
fair
to
see
and
fit
to
share
some
natural
honest
love
and
bear
the
load
of
children
like
the
rest
only
my
soul
was
lost
in
higher
yearnings
like
a
god
he
burst
upon
those
pallid
lifeless
days
bringing
fresh
airs
and
salt
as
from
the
sea
and
wrecked
my
life
how
should
a
virgin
know
deceit
who
never
at
the
joyous
shrine
of
cypris
knelt
but
ever
lived
apart
and
so
grew
guilty
for
if
i
had
spent
my
days
among
the
throng
either
my
fault
were
blameless
or
undone
for
innocence
the
tempter
spreads
his
net
for
innocence
the
gods
keep
all
their
terrors
innocence
it
is
that
bears
the
burden
which
for
guilt
is
lightened
and
the
spoiler
goes
his
way
uncaring
joyous
leaving
her
alone
the
victim
and
unfriended
was
it
just
in
her
my
mistress
who
had
had
my
youth
to
wreak
such
vengeance
on
me
i
had
erred
it
may
be
but
on
him
whose
was
the
guilt
no
vengeance
lighted
but
he
sped
away
to
other
hearts
across
the
deep
careless
and
free
but
me
the
cold
stern
eyes
of
the
pure
goddess
withered
and
the
scorn
of
maids
despised
before
and
the
great
blank
of
love
whose
love
was
gone
this
wrung
my
heart
and
froze
my
blood
set
on
my
brow
despair
and
turned
my
gaze
to
stone
and
filled
my
eyes
with
horror
and
stiffened
the
soft
curls
which
once
lay
smooth
and
fair
into
such
rings
as
made
my
aspect
fearful
all
who
saw
shrank
from
me
and
grew
cold
and
felt
the
warm
full
tide
of
life
freeze
in
them
seeing
in
me
love
work
who
sat
wrapt
up
and
lost
in
shame
as
in
a
cloak
consuming
my
own
heart
and
was
in
hell
already
as
they
gazed
upon
me
my
despair
looked
forth
so
cold
from
out
my
eyes
that
if
some
spoiler
came
fresh
from
his
wickedness
and
looked
on
them
their
glare
would
strike
him
dead
and
those
fair
curls
which
once
the
accursèd
toyed
with
grew
to
be
the
poisonous
things
thou
seest
and
so
with
hate
of
man
injustice
and
the
gods
who
knew
me
blameless
and
yet
punished
me
and
sick
of
life
and
love
and
loathing
earth
and
sky
and
feeding
on
my
sorrow
hate
at
last
left
me
a
fury
ah
the
load
of
life
which
lives
for
hatred
we
are
made
to
love
we
women
and
the
injury
which
turns
the
honey
of
our
lives
to
gall
transforms
the
angel
to
the
fiend
for
it
is
sweet
to
know
the
dreadful
sense
of
strength
and
smite
and
leave
the
tyrant
dead
with
a
glance
ay
sweet
in
that
fierce
lust
of
power
to
slay
the
life
which
harmed
not
when
the
suppliants
cry
ascends
to
ears
which
hate
has
deafened
so
i
lived
long
time
in
misery
to
my
sleepless
eyes
no
healing
slumbers
coming
but
at
length
zeus
and
the
goddess
pitying
i
knew
soft
rest
once
more
veiling
my
dreadful
gaze
in
peaceful
slumbers
then
a
blessed
dream
i
dreamt
for
lo
a
knight
in
mail
of
gold
who
sheared
with
his
keen
flashing
blade
with
scarce
a
pang
of
pain
the
visage
cold
which
too
great
sorrow
left
me
at
one
stroke
clean
from
the
trunk
and
then
land
and
sea
invisible
sped
with
winged
heels
to
where
upon
a
cape
a
fair
young
maid
more
blameless
even
than
i
was
chained
and
bound
waited
a
monster
from
the
deep
and
stood
in
innocent
nakedness
then
as
he
rose
loathsome
from
out
the
depths
a
monstrous
growth
a
creature
wholly
serpent
partly
man
the
wrongs
that
i
had
known
stronger
than
death
rose
up
with
such
black
hate
in
me
again
and
wreathed
such
hissing
poison
through
my
hair
and
shot
such
deadly
glances
from
my
eyes
that
nought
that
saw
might
live
and
the
vile
worm
was
slain
and
she
delivered
then
i
dreamt
my
mistress
whom
i
thought
so
stern
to
me
athené
set
those
dreadful
staring
eyes
and
that
despairing
visage
on
her
shield
of
chastity
and
bears
it
evermore
to
fright
the
waverer
from
the
wrong
he
would
and
strike
the
unrepenting
spoiler
dead
then
for
a
little
paused
she
while
i
saw
again
her
eyes
grown
dreadful
till
once
more
and
with
a
softer
glance
from
that
blest
dream
i
woke
not
on
the
earth
but
only
here
and
now
my
pain
is
lightened
since
i
know
my
dream
which
was
a
dream
within
the
dream
which
is
our
life
fulfilled
and
i
have
saved
another
through
my
suffering
and
through
her
a
people
oh
strange
chain
of
sacrifice
that
binds
an
innocent
life
and
from
its
blood
and
sorrow
works
out
joy
oh
mystery
of
pain
and
evil
wrong
grown
salutary
and
mighty
to
redeem
if
thou
shouldst
see
a
woman
on
the
earth
who
pays
like
penalty
of
sin
and
the
new
gods
for
after
saturn
zeus
ruled
after
him
it
may
be
there
are
others
love
to
take
the
tender
heart
of
girlhood
and
to
immure
within
a
cold
and
cloistered
cell
the
life
which
nature
meant
to
bless
and
if
love
come
hold
her
accursèd
or
to
some
poor
maid
forlorn
and
trusting
still
the
tempter
comes
and
works
his
wrong
and
leaves
her
in
despair
and
shame
and
all
abhorrence
while
he
goes
his
way
unpunished
if
thou
know
her
eyes
freeze
thee
like
mine
oh
bid
her
lose
her
pain
in
succouring
others
say
to
her
that
time
and
death
have
healing
hands
and
here
there
comes
to
the
forgiven
transgressor
only
pain
enough
to
chasten
joy
and
a
soft
tear
trembled
within
her
eyes
and
her
sweet
gaze
was
as
the
magdalen
the
horror
gone
and
a
great
radiance
come
then
as
i
passed
to
upper
air
i
saw
two
figures
rise
together
one
a
woman
with
a
grave
fair
face
not
all
unhappy
and
the
robes
and
presence
of
a
queen
and
with
her
walked
the
fairest
youth
that
ever
maiden
dream
conceived
and
as
they
came
the
throng
of
ghosts
for
these
who
were
not
wholly
ghosts
arose
and
did
them
homage
not
the
chain
of
love
bound
them
but
such
calm
kinship
as
is
bred
of
long
and
difficult
pilgrimages
borne
through
common
perils
by
two
souls
which
share
a
common
weary
exile
nor
as
ghosts
these
showed
but
rather
like
two
lives
which
hung
suspended
in
a
trance
a
halo
of
life
played
round
them
and
they
brought
a
sweet
brisk
air
tasting
of
earth
and
heaven
like
sojourners
who
stayed
but
for
awhile
and
knew
a
swift
release
await
them
first
the
youth
it
was
who
spake
thus
as
they
passed
dread
queen
once
more
i
feel
life
stir
within
me
and
my
blood
run
faster
while
a
new
strange
cycle
turns
and
grows
completed
soon
on
the
dear
earth
under
the
lively
light
of
fuller
day
i
shall
revive
me
of
my
wound
and
thou
passing
with
me
yon
cold
and
lifeless
stream
and
the
grim
monster
who
will
fawn
on
thee
shalt
issue
in
royal
pomp
and
wreathed
with
flowers
upon
the
cheerful
earth
leaving
behind
a
deeper
winter
for
the
ghosts
who
dwell
within
these
sunless
haunts
and
i
shall
lie
once
more
within
loved
arms
and
thou
shalt
see
thy
early
home
and
kiss
thy
mother
cheek
and
be
a
girl
again
but
not
for
long
for
ere
the
bounteous
autumn
spreads
her
hues
of
gold
and
purple
a
cold
voice
will
call
and
bring
us
to
these
wintry
lands
once
more
as
erst
so
often
blest
are
we
indeed
above
the
rest
and
yet
i
would
i
knew
the
careless
joys
of
old
for
in
hot
youth
oh
it
was
sweet
to
greet
the
balmy
night
that
was
love
nurse
and
feel
the
weary
eyes
closed
by
soft
kisses
sweet
at
early
dawn
to
wake
refreshed
and
scarce
from
loving
arms
leaping
to
issue
forth
with
winding
horn
by
dewy
heath
and
brake
and
taste
the
fair
young
breath
of
early
morning
and
was
sweet
to
chase
the
bounding
quarry
all
day
long
with
my
true
hounds
and
rapid
steed
and
gay
companions
of
my
youth
and
with
the
eve
to
turn
home
laden
with
the
spoil
and
take
the
banquet
which
awaited
and
sweet
wine
poured
out
and
kisses
pressed
on
loving
lips
circled
by
snowy
arms
oh
it
was
sweet
to
be
alive
and
young
for
sure
it
is
the
gods
gave
not
quick
pulses
and
hot
blood
and
strength
and
beauty
for
no
end
but
would
that
we
should
use
them
wisely
and
the
fair
sweet
mistress
of
my
service
was
indeed
worthy
of
all
observance
oh
her
eyes
when
i
lay
bleeding
all
day
long
we
rode
i
and
my
youthful
peers
with
horse
and
hound
and
knew
the
joy
of
swift
pursuit
and
toil
and
peril
at
the
last
a
fierce
boar
turned
at
bay
and
with
his
gleaming
tusks
my
steed
and
as
i
fell
upon
the
flowers
pierced
me
as
with
a
sword
then
as
i
lay
i
knew
the
strange
slow
chill
which
stealing
tells
the
young
that
it
is
death
yet
knew
i
not
of
pain
or
fear
only
great
pity
indeed
that
she
should
lose
her
love
who
was
so
fond
and
gracious
but
when
lifting
my
dim
gaze
i
saw
her
bend
me
the
lovely
eyes
suffused
with
tears
and
her
sweet
smile
replaced
by
agonized
sorrow
for
a
while
i
stayed
life
ebbing
tide
and
raised
my
cold
white
lips
with
a
faint
smile
to
hers
then
with
a
kiss
one
long
last
kiss
we
mingled
and
i
knew
no
more
but
even
in
death
so
strong
is
love
i
could
not
wholly
die
and
year
by
year
when
the
bright
springtime
comes
and
the
earth
lives
love
opens
these
dread
gates
and
calls
me
forth
across
the
gulf
not
here
indeed
she
comes
being
a
goddess
and
in
heaven
but
smooths
my
path
to
the
old
earth
where
still
i
know
once
more
the
sweet
lost
days
and
once
again
blossom
on
that
soft
breast
and
am
again
a
youth
and
rapt
in
love
and
yet
not
all
as
careless
as
of
yore
but
seem
to
know
the
early
spring
of
passion
tamed
by
time
and
suffering
to
a
calmer
fuller
flow
less
fitful
but
more
strong
then
the
sad
queen
fair
youth
thy
lot
i
know
for
i
am
old
as
the
old
earth
and
yet
as
young
as
is
the
budding
spring
and
i
was
here
a
queen
when
love
was
not
or
time
and
to
my
arms
thou
camest
as
a
little
child
to
dwell
within
the
halls
of
death
for
without
death
there
were
nor
birth
nor
love
nor
would
life
yearn
to
lose
itself
within
another
life
and
dying
to
be
born
i
too
have
died
for
love
in
part
and
live
again
through
love
for
in
the
years
when
time
was
young
and
love
unborn
on
earth
and
zeus
in
heaven
ruled
a
young
sovereign
i
a
maiden
dwelt
with
dread
demeter
on
the
lovely
plains
of
sunny
sicily
there
day
by
day
i
sported
with
the
maiden
goddesses
in
virgin
freedom
budding
age
made
gay
our
lightsome
feet
and
on
the
flowery
slopes
we
wandered
daily
gathering
flowers
to
weave
in
careless
garlands
for
our
locks
and
passed
the
days
in
innocent
gladness
thought
of
love
there
came
not
to
us
for
as
yet
the
earth
was
virginal
nor
yet
had
eros
come
with
his
delicious
pain
and
one
fair
morn
not
all
the
ages
blot
it
on
the
side
of
ætna
we
were
straying
there
was
then
summer
nor
winter
springtide
nor
the
time
of
harvest
but
the
soft
unfailing
sun
shone
always
and
the
sowing
time
was
one
with
reaping
fruit
and
flower
together
sprung
upon
the
trees
and
blade
and
ripened
ear
together
clothed
the
plains
there
as
i
strayed
sudden
a
black
cloud
down
the
rugged
side
of
ætna
mixed
with
fire
and
dreadful
sound
of
thunder
rolled
around
me
and
i
heard
the
maids
who
were
my
fellows
turn
and
flee
with
shrieks
and
cries
for
me
but
i
i
knew
no
terror
while
the
god
me
hiding
my
life
in
his
nor
when
i
wept
my
flowers
all
withered
and
my
blood
ran
slow
within
a
wintry
land
some
voice
there
was
which
said
not
thou
shalt
return
and
see
thy
mother
again
only
a
little
while
fate
wills
that
thou
shouldst
tarry
and
become
queen
of
another
world
thou
seest
that
all
thy
flowers
are
faded
they
shall
live
again
on
earth
as
thou
shalt
as
thou
livest
now
the
life
of
death
for
what
is
death
but
life
suspended
as
in
sleep
the
changeless
rule
where
life
was
constant
and
the
sun
blazed
forth
for
ever
changes
and
is
hidden
awhile
this
region
which
thou
seest
where
all
the
trees
are
lifeless
and
the
flowers
are
dead
is
but
the
earth
on
which
erewhile
thou
sportedst
fancy
free
so
without
fear
i
wandered
on
this
bare
land
seeing
far
upon
the
sky
the
peaks
of
my
own
hills
and
crests
of
my
own
woods
till
when
i
grew
hungered
ere
yet
another
form
i
saw
along
the
silent
alleys
journeying
and
leafless
groves
a
fair
and
mystic
tree
rose
like
a
heart
in
shape
and
its
leaves
one
golden
mystic
fruit
with
a
fair
seed
hid
in
it
this
with
childish
hand
i
took
and
ate
and
straight
i
knew
the
tree
was
life
and
the
fruit
death
and
the
hid
seed
was
love
ah
sweet
strange
fruit
the
which
if
any
taste
they
may
no
longer
keep
their
lives
of
old
or
their
own
selves
unchanged
but
some
weird
change
and
subtle
alchemy
comes
which
can
transmute
the
blood
and
mould
the
spirits
of
gods
and
men
in
some
new
magical
form
not
as
before
our
life
comes
to
us
though
the
passion
cools
no
never
as
before
my
mother
came
too
late
to
seek
me
she
had
power
to
raise
a
life
from
out
death
grasp
but
from
the
arms
of
love
she
might
not
take
me
nor
undo
love
past
for
all
her
strength
she
came
and
sought
with
fires
her
daughter
over
land
and
sea
beyond
the
paths
of
all
the
setting
stars
in
vain
and
over
all
the
earth
in
vain
seeking
whom
love
disguised
then
on
all
lands
she
cast
the
spell
of
barrenness
the
wheat
was
blighted
in
the
ear
the
purple
grapes
blushed
no
more
on
the
vines
and
all
the
gods
were
sorrowful
seeing
the
load
of
ill
my
rape
had
laid
on
men
last
zeus
himself
pitying
the
evil
that
was
done
sent
forth
his
messenger
beyond
the
western
rim
to
fetch
me
back
to
earth
but
not
the
same
he
found
me
who
had
eaten
of
love
seed
but
changed
into
another
nor
could
his
power
prevail
to
keep
me
wholly
on
the
earth
or
make
me
maid
again
the
wintry
life
is
homelier
often
than
the
summer
blaze
of
happiness
unclouded
so
when
spring
comes
on
the
world
i
coming
cross
with
thee
year
after
year
the
cruel
icy
stream
and
leave
this
anxious
sceptre
and
the
shades
of
those
in
hell
or
those
for
whom
though
blest
no
spring
comes
till
the
last
great
spring
which
brings
new
heavens
and
new
earth
and
lay
my
head
upon
my
mother
bosom
and
grow
young
and
am
a
girl
again
a
soft
air
breathes
across
the
stream
and
fills
these
barren
fields
with
the
sweet
odours
of
the
earth
i
know
again
the
perfume
of
the
violets
which
bloom
on
ætna
side
soon
we
shall
pass
together
to
our
home
while
round
our
feet
the
crocus
flames
like
gold
the
white
wave
their
soft
petals
on
the
breeze
and
all
the
choir
of
flowers
lift
up
their
silent
song
to
the
unclouded
heavens
thou
fair
boy
shalt
lie
within
thy
love
white
arms
again
and
i
within
my
mother
sweet
is
love
in
ceasing
and
renewal
nay
in
these
it
lives
and
has
its
being
thou
couldst
not
keep
thy
youth
as
now
if
always
on
the
breast
of
love
too
late
a
lingerer
thou
hadst
known
possession
sate
thee
nor
might
i
have
kept
my
mother
heart
if
i
had
lived
to
ripe
and
wither
on
the
stalk
time
calls
and
change
commands
both
men
and
gods
and
speeds
us
on
we
know
not
whither
but
the
old
earth
smiles
spring
after
spring
and
the
seed
bursts
again
out
of
its
prison
mould
and
the
dead
lives
renew
themselves
and
rise
aloft
and
soar
and
are
transformed
clothing
themselves
with
change
till
the
last
change
be
done
as
thus
she
spake
i
saw
a
gleam
of
light
flash
from
the
eyes
of
all
the
listening
shades
and
a
great
joy
thrill
through
the
realms
of
death
and
then
again
a
youthful
shade
i
saw
a
comely
boy
with
lip
and
cheek
just
touched
with
manly
down
and
strong
limbs
wearing
spring
in
mien
and
garb
a
youthful
chieftain
with
a
perfect
face
of
fresh
young
beauty
clustered
curls
divine
and
chiselled
features
like
a
sculptured
god
but
warm
and
breathing
life
only
the
eyes
the
fair
large
eyes
were
full
of
dreaming
thought
and
seemed
to
gaze
beyond
the
world
of
sight
on
a
hid
world
of
beauty
him
i
stayed
accosting
with
soft
words
of
courtesy
and
on
a
bank
of
scentless
flowers
reclined
he
answered
thus
not
for
the
garish
sun
i
long
nor
for
the
splendours
of
high
noon
in
this
dim
land
i
languish
for
of
yore
full
often
when
the
swift
chase
swept
along
through
the
brisk
morn
or
when
my
comrades
called
to
wrestling
or
the
or
to
cleave
the
sunny
stream
i
loved
to
walk
apart
sole
and
when
the
laughing
girls
to
some
fair
stripling
oaten
melody
made
ready
for
the
dance
i
heeded
not
nor
when
to
the
loud
trumpet
blast
and
blare
my
peers
rode
forth
to
battle
for
one
eve
in
latmos
after
a
long
day
in
june
i
stayed
to
rest
me
on
a
sylvan
hill
where
often
youth
and
maid
were
wont
to
meet
towards
moonrise
and
deep
slumber
fell
on
me
musing
on
love
just
as
the
ruddy
orb
rose
on
the
lucid
night
set
in
a
frame
of
blooming
myrtle
and
sharp
tremulous
plane
deep
slumber
fell
and
loosed
my
limbs
in
rest
then
as
the
full
orb
poised
upon
the
peak
there
came
a
lovely
vision
of
a
maid
who
seemed
to
step
as
from
a
golden
car
out
of
the
moon
no
mortal
form
such
as
ofttimes
of
yore
i
knew
and
clasped
at
twilight
the
vines
at
the
mad
feast
of
dionysus
or
the
fair
maids
cold
who
streamed
in
white
processions
to
the
shrine
of
the
chaste
virgin
goddess
but
a
shape
richer
and
yet
more
pure
no
thinnest
veil
obscured
her
but
each
exquisite
limb
revealed
gleamed
like
a
golden
statue
subtly
wrought
by
a
great
sculptor
on
the
architrave
of
some
high
only
in
her
the
form
was
soft
and
warm
and
charged
with
life
and
breathing
as
i
seemed
to
gaze
on
her
nearer
she
drew
and
gazed
and
as
i
lay
supine
as
in
a
spell
the
radiance
stooped
and
kissed
me
on
the
lips
a
chaste
sweet
kiss
which
drew
my
spirit
with
it
so
i
slept
each
night
upon
the
hill
until
the
dawn
came
in
her
silver
chariot
from
the
east
and
chased
my
love
away
but
ever
thus
dissolved
in
love
as
in
a
dream
whenever
the
bright
circle
of
the
moon
climbed
from
the
hills
whether
in
leafy
june
or
or
when
they
leapt
and
pressed
the
spouting
must
i
walked
apart
from
all
and
took
no
thought
for
mortal
maid
nor
nimble
joys
of
youth
but
night
by
night
i
stole
when
all
were
sleeping
to
the
hill
and
slumbered
and
was
blest
until
i
grew
possest
by
love
so
deep
i
seemed
to
live
in
slumber
only
while
the
waking
day
showed
faint
as
any
vision
so
i
turned
paler
and
paler
with
the
months
and
climbed
the
steep
with
laboured
steps
and
difficult
breath
but
still
i
climbed
ay
though
the
wintry
frost
chained
fast
the
streams
and
whitened
all
the
fields
i
sought
my
mistress
through
the
leafless
groves
and
slumbered
and
was
happy
till
the
dawn
returning
found
me
stretched
out
cold
and
stark
with
life
fire
nigh
burnt
out
till
one
clear
night
when
the
birds
shivered
in
the
pines
and
all
the
inner
heavens
stood
open
lo
she
came
brighter
and
kinder
still
and
kissed
my
eyes
and
lips
and
drew
my
soul
through
them
and
in
one
precious
ecstasy
dissolved
my
life
and
thenceforth
ever
on
the
hill
i
lie
unseen
of
man
a
cold
white
form
still
young
through
all
the
ages
but
my
soul
clothed
in
this
thin
presentment
of
old
days
walks
this
dim
land
where
never
moonrise
comes
nor
but
a
twilight
no
more
and
ah
how
weary
yet
i
judge
my
lot
a
higher
far
than
his
who
spends
his
youth
on
swift
hot
pleasure
quickly
past
or
theirs
my
equals
who
through
long
calm
years
grew
sleek
in
dull
content
of
wedded
lives
and
offspring
many
a
day
for
them
while
i
was
wandering
here
and
my
bones
bleached
upon
the
rocks
the
sweet
autumnal
sun
beamed
and
the
grapes
grew
purple
many
a
day
they
heaped
up
gold
they
knelt
at
festivals
they
waxed
in
high
report
and
fame
of
men
they
gave
their
girls
in
marriage
while
for
me
upon
the
untrodden
peaks
the
cold
grey
morn
the
snows
the
rains
the
winds
the
untempered
blaze
beat
year
by
year
until
i
turned
to
stone
and
the
great
eagles
shrieked
at
me
and
wheeled
affrighted
yet
i
judge
it
better
indeed
to
seek
in
life
as
now
i
know
i
sought
some
fair
impossible
love
which
slays
our
life
some
fair
ideal
raised
too
high
for
man
and
failing
to
grow
mad
and
cease
to
be
than
to
decline
as
they
do
who
have
found
content
and
weal
and
happiness
and
so
an
end
for
one
day
as
i
know
the
high
aim
unfulfilled
fulfils
itself
the
deep
unsatisfied
thirst
is
satisfied
and
through
this
twilight
broken
suddenly
the
inmost
heaven
the
lucent
stars
of
god
the
moon
of
love
the
sun
of
life
and
i
i
who
pine
here
i
on
the
latmian
hill
shall
soar
aloft
and
find
them
with
the
word
there
beamed
a
shaft
of
dawn
athwart
the
skies
and
straight
the
sentinel
thrush
within
the
yew
sang
out
reveillé
to
the
hosts
of
day
soldierly
and
the
pomp
and
rush
of
life
began
once
more
and
left
me
there
alone
amid
the
awaking
world
nay
not
alone
one
fair
shade
lingered
in
the
fuller
day
the
last
to
come
when
now
my
dream
had
grown
half
mixed
with
waking
thoughts
as
grows
a
dream
in
summer
mornings
when
the
broader
light
dazzles
the
sleeper
eyes
and
is
most
fair
of
all
and
best
remembered
and
becomes
part
of
our
waking
life
when
older
dreams
grow
fainter
and
are
fled
so
this
remained
the
fairest
of
the
visions
that
i
knew
most
precious
and
most
dear
the
increasing
light
shone
through
her
finer
than
the
thinnest
shade
and
yet
most
full
of
beauty
golden
wings
from
her
fair
shoulders
springing
seemed
to
lift
her
stainless
feet
from
the
cold
ground
and
snatch
their
wearer
into
air
and
in
her
eyes
was
such
fair
glance
as
comes
from
virgin
love
long
chastened
and
triumphant
every
trace
of
earth
had
vanished
from
her
and
she
showed
as
one
who
walks
a
saint
already
in
life
virgin
or
mother
immortality
breathed
from
those
radiant
eyes
which
yet
had
passed
between
the
gates
of
death
i
seemed
to
hear
the
soul
of
mortals
speaking
i
was
born
of
a
great
race
and
mighty
and
was
grown
fair
as
they
said
and
good
and
kept
a
life
pure
from
all
stain
of
passion
love
i
knew
not
who
was
absorbed
in
duty
and
the
mother
of
gods
and
men
seeing
my
life
more
calm
than
human
hating
my
impassive
heart
sent
down
her
perfect
son
in
wrath
to
earth
and
bade
him
break
me
but
when
eros
came
it
did
repent
him
of
the
task
for
love
is
kin
to
duty
and
within
my
life
i
knew
miraculous
change
and
a
soft
flame
wherefrom
the
snows
of
duty
flushed
to
rose
and
the
chill
icy
flow
of
mind
was
turned
to
a
warm
stream
of
passion
long
i
lived
not
knowing
what
had
been
nor
recognized
a
presence
walking
with
me
through
my
life
as
if
by
night
his
face
and
form
concealed
a
gracious
voice
alone
which
none
but
i
might
hear
sustained
me
and
its
name
was
love
not
as
the
earthly
loves
which
throb
and
flush
round
earthly
shrines
was
mine
but
a
pure
spirit
lovelier
than
all
embodied
love
more
pure
and
wonderful
but
never
on
his
eyes
i
looked
which
still
were
hidden
and
i
knew
not
the
fashion
of
his
nature
for
by
night
when
visual
eyes
are
blind
but
the
soul
sees
came
he
and
bade
me
seek
not
to
enquire
or
whence
he
came
or
wherefore
nor
knew
i
his
name
and
always
ere
the
coming
day
as
if
he
were
the
lingering
with
some
too
maiden
he
would
rise
and
vanish
until
eve
but
all
my
being
thrilled
with
my
fair
unearthly
visitant
to
higher
duty
and
more
glorious
meed
of
action
than
of
old
for
it
was
love
that
came
to
me
who
might
not
know
his
name
thus
ever
rapt
by
dreams
divine
i
knew
the
scorn
that
comes
from
weaker
souls
which
miss
being
too
low
of
nature
the
great
joy
revealed
to
others
higher
nay
my
sisters
who
being
of
one
blood
with
me
made
choice
to
tread
the
lower
ways
of
daily
life
grew
jealous
of
me
bidding
me
take
heed
lest
haply
was
some
monstrous
fiend
i
loved
such
as
in
fable
ofttimes
sought
and
won
the
innocent
hearts
of
maids
long
time
i
held
my
love
too
dear
for
doubt
who
was
so
sweet
and
lovable
but
at
the
last
the
sneers
the
mystery
which
hid
him
the
swift
flight
before
the
coming
dawn
the
shape
concealed
the
curious
girlish
heart
these
worked
on
me
with
an
unsatisfied
thirst
not
his
own
words
i
am
with
thee
only
while
i
keep
my
visage
hidden
and
if
thou
once
shouldst
see
my
face
i
must
forsake
thee
the
high
gods
link
love
with
faith
and
he
withdraws
himself
from
the
full
gaze
of
knowledge
not
even
these
could
cure
me
of
my
longing
or
the
fear
those
mocking
voices
worked
who
fain
would
learn
the
worst
that
might
befall
and
one
sad
night
just
as
the
day
leapt
from
the
hills
and
brought
the
hour
when
he
should
go
with
tremulous
hands
lighting
my
midnight
lamp
in
fear
i
stood
long
time
uncertain
and
at
length
turned
round
and
gazed
upon
my
love
he
lay
asleep
and
oh
how
fair
he
was
the
flickering
light
fell
on
the
fairest
of
the
gods
stretched
out
in
happy
slumber
looking
on
his
locks
of
gold
and
faultless
face
and
smile
and
limbs
made
perfect
a
great
joy
and
trembling
took
me
who
was
most
blest
of
women
and
in
awe
and
fear
i
stooped
to
kiss
him
one
warm
drop
from
the
full
lamp
within
my
trembling
hand
or
a
glad
tear
from
my
too
happy
eyes
fell
on
his
shoulder
then
the
god
unclosed
his
lovely
eyes
and
with
great
pity
spake
there
is
no
love
except
with
faith
and
thine
is
dead
farewell
i
come
no
more
and
straightway
from
the
hills
the
full
red
sun
leapt
up
and
as
i
clasped
my
love
again
the
lovely
vision
faded
from
his
place
and
came
no
more
then
i
with
breaking
heart
knowing
my
life
laid
waste
by
my
own
hand
went
forth
and
would
have
sought
to
hide
my
life
within
the
stream
of
death
but
death
came
not
to
aid
me
who
not
yet
was
meet
for
death
then
finding
that
love
came
not
back
to
me
i
thought
that
in
the
temples
of
the
gods
haply
he
dwelt
and
so
from
fane
to
fane
i
wandered
over
earth
and
knelt
in
each
enquiring
for
my
love
and
i
would
ask
the
priests
and
worshippers
this
love
shrine
sirs
have
you
seen
the
god
but
never
at
all
i
found
him
for
some
answered
is
called
the
shrine
of
knowledge
and
another
the
shrine
of
beauty
and
another
and
yet
another
and
i
would
kneel
and
say
a
prayer
to
my
love
and
rise
and
seek
another
long
land
and
sea
i
wandered
till
i
was
not
young
or
fair
grown
wretched
seeking
my
lost
love
and
last
came
to
the
smiling
hateful
shrine
where
ruled
the
queen
of
earthly
love
and
all
delight
cypris
but
knelt
not
there
but
asked
of
one
who
seemed
her
priest
if
eros
dwelt
with
her
then
to
the
goddess
self
they
led
me
she
with
hatred
in
her
eyes
thou
to
seek
for
love
who
art
grown
thin
and
pale
with
watching
he
is
not
for
thee
what
love
is
left
for
such
thou
didst
despise
love
and
didst
dwell
apart
love
sits
within
the
young
maid
eyes
making
them
beautiful
love
is
for
youth
and
joy
and
happiness
and
not
for
withered
lives
ho
bind
her
fast
take
her
and
set
her
to
the
vilest
tasks
and
bend
her
pride
by
solitude
and
tears
who
will
not
kneel
to
me
but
dares
to
seek
a
disembodied
love
my
son
has
gone
and
left
thee
for
thy
fault
and
thou
shalt
know
the
misery
of
my
thralls
then
in
her
house
they
bound
me
to
hard
tasks
and
vile
and
kept
my
life
from
honour
chained
among
her
slaves
and
lowest
ministers
taking
despite
and
injury
for
food
and
set
to
bind
their
wounds
whom
she
had
tortured
and
to
feed
the
pitiful
lives
which
in
her
prisons
pent
languished
in
hopeless
pain
there
is
no
sight
of
suffering
but
i
saw
it
and
was
set
to
succour
it
and
all
my
woman
heart
was
torn
with
the
ineffable
miseries
which
love
and
life
have
worked
and
dwelt
long
time
in
groanings
and
in
tears
and
then
oh
joy
oh
miracle
once
more
at
length
again
i
felt
love
arms
around
me
and
the
kiss
of
love
upon
my
lips
and
in
the
chill
of
deepest
prison
cells
vilest
tasks
the
glow
of
his
sweet
breath
and
the
warm
touch
of
his
invisible
hand
and
his
sweet
voice
ay
sweeter
than
of
old
and
tenderer
speak
to
me
pierce
me
hold
me
fold
me
round
with
arms
divine
till
all
the
sordid
earth
was
hued
like
heaven
and
life
dull
turned
to
a
golden
palace
and
those
low
tasks
grew
to
be
higher
works
and
nobler
gains
than
any
gains
of
knowledge
and
at
last
he
whispered
softly
unclose
thine
eyes
thou
mayst
look
on
me
now
i
go
no
more
but
am
thine
own
for
ever
then
with
wings
of
gold
we
soared
i
looking
in
his
eyes
over
yon
dark
broad
river
and
this
dim
land
scarce
for
an
instant
staying
till
we
reached
the
inmost
courts
of
heaven
but
sometimes
still
i
come
here
for
a
little
and
speak
a
word
of
peace
to
those
who
wait
the
slow
wheel
turns
the
cycles
round
themselves
and
grow
complete
the
world
year
whitens
to
the
and
one
word
only
am
i
sent
to
say
to
those
dear
souls
who
wait
here
or
who
now
breathe
earthly
air
one
universal
word
to
all
things
living
and
the
word
is
then
soared
she
visibly
before
my
gaze
and
the
heavens
took
her
and
i
knew
my
eyes
had
seen
the
soul
of
man
the
deathless
soul
defeated
struggling
purified
and
blest
then
all
the
choir
of
happy
waiting
shades
heroes
and
queens
fair
maidens
and
brave
youths
swept
by
me
rhythmic
slow
as
if
they
trod
some
unheard
measure
passing
where
i
stood
in
fair
procession
each
with
a
faint
smile
upon
the
lip
signing
farewell
oh
shade
it
shall
be
well
with
thee
as
is
with
us
if
only
thou
art
true
the
world
of
life
the
world
of
death
are
but
opposing
sides
of
one
great
orb
and
the
light
shines
on
both
oh
happy
happy
shade
farewell
farewell
and
so
they
passed
away
end
of
book
ii
book
iii
olympus
but
i
my
gaze
following
the
soaring
soul
which
now
was
lost
in
the
awakening
skies
floated
with
her
as
in
a
trance
beyond
the
golden
gates
which
separate
earth
from
heaven
and
to
my
thought
gladdened
by
that
broad
effluence
of
light
this
old
earth
seemed
transfigured
and
the
fields
so
dim
and
bare
grew
green
and
clothed
themselves
with
lustrous
hues
a
fine
ethereal
air
played
round
me
as
i
mused
and
filled
the
soul
with
an
ineffable
content
what
need
of
words
to
tell
of
things
unreached
by
words
or
seek
to
engrave
upon
the
treacherous
thought
the
fair
and
fugitive
fancies
of
a
dream
which
vanish
ere
we
fix
them
but
methinks
he
knows
the
scene
who
knows
the
one
fair
day
one
only
and
no
more
which
year
by
year
in
springtime
comes
when
lingering
winter
flies
and
lo
the
trees
blossom
in
white
and
pink
and
golden
clusters
and
the
glades
are
filled
with
delicate
primrose
and
deep
odorous
beds
of
violets
and
on
the
tufted
meads
with
kingcups
starred
and
cowslip
bells
and
blue
sweet
hyacinths
and
frail
anemones
the
broad
west
wind
breathes
softly
and
the
air
is
tremulous
with
the
lark
and
thro
the
woods
the
soft
thrushes
all
day
long
flood
the
green
dells
with
joy
and
thro
the
dry
brown
fields
the
sower
strides
sowing
his
seed
and
all
is
life
and
song
or
he
who
first
whether
in
fair
free
boyhood
when
the
world
is
his
to
choose
or
when
his
fuller
life
beats
to
another
life
or
afterwards
keeping
his
youth
within
his
children
eyes
looks
on
the
everlasting
hills
and
marks
the
sunset
smite
them
and
is
glad
of
the
beautiful
fair
world
a
springtide
land
it
seemed
where
east
winds
came
not
sweetest
song
was
everywhere
by
glade
or
sunny
plain
and
thro
the
golden
valleys
winding
streams
rippled
in
glancing
silver
and
above
the
blue
hills
rose
and
over
all
a
peak
white
awful
with
a
constant
fleece
of
cloud
veiling
its
summit
towered
unfailing
day
lighted
it
for
no
turn
of
dawn
and
eve
came
there
nor
changing
seasons
but
a
broad
fixed
joy
of
being
undisturbed
by
time
there
in
a
happy
glade
shut
in
by
groves
of
laurel
and
sweet
myrtle
on
a
green
and
lawn
i
seemed
to
see
the
ghosts
of
the
old
gods
upon
the
gentle
slope
of
a
fair
hill
a
joyous
company
the
immortals
lay
hard
by
a
murmurous
stream
fell
through
the
flowers
below
them
space
on
space
laughed
the
immeasurable
plains
beyond
the
mystic
mountain
soared
height
after
height
of
bare
rock
ledges
left
the
climbing
pines
and
reared
their
giddy
shining
terraces
into
the
ethereal
air
above
the
snows
of
the
white
summit
cleft
the
fleece
of
cloud
which
always
clothed
it
round
ah
sweet
yet
with
a
ghostly
fairness
fine
and
thin
those
godlike
presences
not
dreams
indeed
but
something
were
they
blessed
shades
heroic
and
divine
as
when
in
days
when
man
was
young
and
time
the
vivid
thought
translated
into
form
the
unattained
impossible
beauty
of
men
dreams
and
fixed
the
loveliness
in
marble
as
with
awe
following
my
spotless
guide
i
stood
apart
not
daring
to
draw
near
a
shining
form
rose
from
the
throng
and
floated
light
as
air
to
where
i
trembled
and
i
knew
the
face
and
form
of
artemis
the
fair
the
pure
the
undefiled
a
crescent
silvery
moon
shone
thro
her
locks
and
by
her
side
she
bore
a
quiver
of
golden
darts
at
sight
of
whom
i
felt
a
sudden
chill
like
his
who
once
looked
upon
her
and
died
yet
could
not
fear
seeing
how
fair
she
was
her
sweet
voice
rang
clear
as
a
bird
mortal
what
fate
hath
brought
thee
hither
uncleansed
by
death
how
canst
thou
breathe
immortal
air
being
mortal
yet
fear
not
since
thou
art
come
for
we
too
are
of
earth
whom
here
thou
seest
there
were
not
a
heaven
were
there
no
earth
nor
gods
had
men
not
been
but
each
the
complement
of
each
and
grown
the
other
creature
is
and
has
its
being
a
double
essence
human
and
divine
so
that
the
god
is
hidden
in
the
man
and
something
human
bounds
and
forms
the
god
which
else
had
shown
too
great
and
undefined
for
mortal
sight
and
having
no
human
eye
to
see
it
were
unknown
but
we
who
bore
sway
of
old
time
we
were
but
attributes
of
the
great
god
who
is
all
things
that
be
the
pillar
of
the
earth
and
starry
sky
the
depth
of
the
great
deep
the
sun
the
moon
the
word
which
makes
the
love
for
all
things
lie
within
his
infinite
form
even
as
she
spake
a
throng
of
heavenly
forms
floated
around
me
filling
all
my
soul
with
fair
unearthly
beauty
and
the
air
with
such
ambrosial
perfume
as
is
born
when
morning
bursts
upon
a
tropic
sea
from
boundless
wastes
of
flowers
and
as
i
knelt
in
rapture
lo
the
same
clear
voice
again
from
out
the
throng
of
gods
those
whom
thou
seest
were
even
as
i
embodiments
of
him
who
is
the
centre
of
all
life
myself
the
of
purity
and
strength
divine
when
unabused
love
too
the
spring
and
cause
of
things
and
knowledge
which
lays
bare
their
secret
and
calm
duty
queen
of
all
and
motherhood
in
one
and
youth
which
bears
beauty
of
form
and
life
and
light
and
breathes
the
breath
of
inspiration
and
the
soul
the
particle
of
god
sent
down
to
man
which
doth
in
turn
reveal
the
world
and
god
wherefore
it
is
men
called
on
artemis
the
refuge
of
young
souls
for
still
in
age
they
keep
some
dim
reflection
uneffaced
of
a
diviner
purity
than
comes
to
the
spring
days
of
youth
when
all
the
world
smiles
and
the
rapid
blood
thro
the
young
veins
courses
and
all
is
glad
yet
knowing
too
that
innocence
is
young
before
the
soil
and
smirch
of
sadder
knowledge
settling
on
it
sully
its
primal
whiteness
so
they
knelt
at
my
white
shrines
the
eager
vigorous
youths
to
whom
life
road
showed
like
a
dewy
field
in
early
summer
dawns
when
to
the
sound
of
youth
clear
voice
and
to
the
cheerful
rush
of
the
tumultuous
feet
and
clamorous
tongues
careering
onwards
fair
and
dappled
fawns
strange
birds
with
jewelled
plumes
fierce
spotted
pards
rise
in
the
joyous
chase
to
be
caught
and
bound
by
the
young
conqueror
nor
yet
the
charm
of
sensual
ease
allures
and
they
knelt
too
the
pure
sweet
maidens
fair
and
whose
innocent
virgin
hearts
shrank
from
the
touch
of
passion
as
from
wrong
sweet
moonlit
lives
which
fade
and
pale
and
vanish
in
the
glare
of
love
hot
noontide
these
came
robed
in
white
with
holy
hymns
and
soaring
liturgies
and
so
men
fabled
me
a
huntress
now
borne
thro
the
flying
woodlands
fair
and
free
and
now
the
pale
cold
moon
light
without
warmth
zeal
without
touch
of
passion
heavenly
love
for
human
and
the
altar
for
the
home
but
oh
how
sweet
it
was
to
take
the
love
and
awe
of
my
young
worshippers
to
watch
the
pure
young
gaze
and
hear
the
pure
young
voice
mount
in
the
hymn
or
see
the
gay
troop
come
with
the
first
dawn
of
day
brushing
the
dew
from
the
unpolluted
fields
and
wake
to
song
the
slumbering
birds
strong
in
their
innocence
i
did
not
envy
any
goddess
of
all
the
olympian
company
her
votaries
ah
happy
days
of
old
which
now
are
gone
a
memory
and
a
dream
for
now
on
earth
i
rule
no
longer
young
willing
hearts
in
voluntary
fealty
which
should
cease
when
love
with
fiery
accents
calling
woke
the
slumbering
soul
as
now
it
should
for
those
who
kneel
before
the
purer
sadder
shrine
which
has
replaced
my
own
but
ah
too
oft
not
always
but
too
often
shut
from
life
within
pale
cloisters
and
the
bars
of
deadly
convent
prisons
year
by
year
age
after
age
the
white
souls
fade
and
pine
which
simulate
the
joyous
service
free
of
those
young
worshippers
i
would
that
i
might
loose
the
captives
chain
or
herakles
who
was
a
mortal
once
but
he
who
stood
colossal
at
my
side
i
toil
no
more
on
earth
nor
wield
again
the
mighty
strength
which
zeus
once
gave
me
for
the
cure
of
ill
i
have
run
my
race
i
have
done
my
work
i
rest
for
ever
from
the
toilsome
days
i
gave
to
the
suffering
race
of
men
and
yet
indeed
methinks
they
suffer
still
tyrannous
growths
and
monstrous
vex
them
still
pestilence
lurks
and
sweeps
them
down
treacheries
come
and
wars
and
slay
them
still
vaulting
ambition
leaps
and
falls
in
bloodshed
still
but
i
am
here
at
rest
and
no
man
kneels
to
me
or
keeps
reverence
for
strength
mighty
yet
unabused
strength
which
is
power
god
choicest
gift
more
rare
and
precious
than
all
beauty
or
the
charm
of
wisdom
since
it
is
the
instrument
thro
which
all
nature
works
for
now
the
earth
is
full
of
meekness
and
a
new
god
rules
teaching
strange
precepts
of
humility
and
mercy
and
forgiveness
yet
i
trow
there
is
no
lack
of
bloodshed
and
deceit
and
groanings
and
the
tyrant
works
his
wrong
even
as
of
old
but
now
there
is
no
arm
like
mine
made
strong
by
zeus
to
beat
him
down
him
and
his
wrong
together
yet
i
know
i
am
not
all
discrowned
the
strong
brave
souls
the
manly
tender
hearts
whom
tale
of
wrong
to
woman
or
child
to
all
weak
things
and
small
fires
like
a
blow
calling
the
righteous
flush
of
anger
to
the
brow
knotting
the
cords
of
muscle
on
the
arm
with
one
desire
to
hew
the
spoiler
down
and
make
an
end
and
go
their
way
for
others
making
light
of
toil
and
pain
and
too
laborious
days
and
peril
beat
unchanged
albeit
they
serve
a
lord
of
meekness
for
the
world
still
needs
its
champion
as
of
old
and
finds
him
still
not
always
now
with
mighty
sinews
and
thews
like
mine
though
still
these
profit
but
keen
brain
and
voice
to
move
men
souls
to
love
the
right
and
hate
the
wrong
even
tho
the
bodily
form
be
weak
of
giant
strength
strong
to
assail
the
hydra
heads
of
evil
and
to
slay
the
monsters
that
now
waste
them
ignorance
coward
fears
the
hate
of
man
disguised
as
love
of
god
these
there
are
still
with
task
as
hard
as
mine
for
what
was
it
to
strive
with
bodily
ills
and
do
great
deeds
of
daring
and
of
strength
and
bear
the
crown
to
his
who
wages
lifelong
doubtful
strife
with
an
impalpable
foe
conquering
indeed
but
ere
he
hears
the
pæan
or
sees
the
pomp
laid
low
in
the
arms
of
death
and
tho
men
cease
to
worship
at
my
shrine
yet
not
the
less
i
hold
it
is
the
toils
i
knew
the
pains
i
bore
for
others
which
have
kept
the
heart
of
manhood
undefiled
and
nerved
the
arm
of
sacrifice
and
made
the
martyr
strong
to
do
and
bear
and
taught
the
race
of
men
how
godlike
is
to
suffer
thro
life
and
die
at
last
for
others
good
the
strong
god
ceased
and
stood
a
little
musing
blest
indeed
but
bearing
as
it
seemed
some
faintest
trace
of
earthly
struggle
still
not
the
gay
ease
of
the
elder
gods
and
then
there
came
beauty
and
joy
in
one
bearing
the
form
of
woman
how
to
reach
with
halting
words
that
infinite
perfection
all
have
known
the
breathing
marbles
which
the
greek
has
left
who
saw
her
near
and
strove
to
fix
her
charms
and
exquisitely
failed
or
those
fair
forms
the
painter
offered
at
a
later
shrine
and
failed
nay
what
are
words
he
knows
it
well
who
loves
or
who
has
loved
she
with
a
smile
playing
around
her
rosy
lips
as
plays
the
sunbeam
on
a
stream
shall
i
complain
men
kneel
to
me
no
longer
taking
to
them
some
graver
sterner
worship
grown
too
wise
for
fleeting
joys
of
love
nay
love
is
youth
and
still
the
world
is
young
still
shall
i
reign
within
the
hearts
of
men
while
time
shall
last
and
life
renews
itself
all
life
that
is
from
the
weak
things
of
earth
or
sea
or
air
which
creep
or
float
for
an
hour
to
godlike
man
all
know
me
and
are
mine
i
am
the
source
and
mother
of
all
both
gods
and
men
the
spring
of
force
and
joy
which
penetrating
all
within
the
hidden
depths
of
the
unknown
sets
the
blind
seed
of
being
and
from
the
bond
of
incomplete
and
dual
essences
evolves
the
harmony
which
is
life
the
world
were
dead
without
my
rays
who
am
the
light
which
vivifies
the
world
nay
but
for
me
the
universal
order
which
attracts
sphere
unto
sphere
and
keeps
them
in
their
paths
for
ever
were
no
more
all
things
are
bound
within
my
golden
chain
whose
name
is
love
and
if
there
be
indeed
some
sterner
souls
or
sunk
in
too
much
learning
or
hedged
round
by
care
and
greed
or
haply
too
much
rapt
by
pale
ascetic
fervours
to
delight
to
kneel
to
me
the
universal
voice
scorns
them
as
those
who
missing
willingly
the
good
that
nature
offers
dwell
unblest
who
might
be
blest
but
would
not
every
voice
of
bard
in
every
age
has
hymned
me
all
the
breathing
marbles
all
the
heavenly
hues
of
painting
praise
me
even
the
loveless
shades
of
dim
monastic
cloisters
show
some
gleam
tho
faint
of
me
amid
the
busy
throngs
of
cities
reign
i
and
lonely
plains
beyond
the
of
the
frozen
north
and
the
warm
waves
of
undiscovered
seas
for
i
was
born
out
of
the
sparkling
foam
which
lights
the
crest
of
the
blue
mystic
wave
stirred
by
the
wandering
breath
of
life
pure
dawn
from
a
young
soul
calm
depths
there
without
voice
stretched
on
the
breathing
curve
of
a
young
breast
fluttering
a
little
fresh
from
the
great
deep
of
life
and
creamy
as
the
opening
rose
naked
i
lie
naked
yet
unashamed
while
youth
warm
tide
steals
round
me
with
a
kiss
and
floods
each
limb
with
fairness
shame
i
know
not
shame
is
for
wrong
and
not
for
innocence
the
veil
which
error
grasps
to
hide
itself
from
the
awful
eye
but
i
i
lie
unveiled
and
unashamed
the
livelong
day
i
lie
the
warm
wave
murmuring
to
me
and
all
night
hidden
in
the
moonlit
caves
of
happy
sleep
i
dream
until
the
morning
and
am
glad
why
should
i
seek
to
clothe
myself
and
hide
the
treasure
of
my
beauty
shame
may
wait
on
those
for
whom
was
given
the
sties
of
sense
are
none
of
mine
the
brutish
loveless
wrong
the
venal
charm
the
simulated
flush
of
fleshly
passion
they
are
none
of
mine
only
corruptions
of
me
yet
i
know
the
counterfeit
the
stronger
since
gross
souls
and
brutish
sway
the
earth
and
yet
i
hold
that
sense
itself
is
sacred
and
i
deem
better
to
grow
soft
and
sink
in
sense
than
gloat
blood
and
wrong
my
kingdom
is
over
infinite
grades
of
being
all
breathing
things
from
the
least
crawling
insect
to
the
brute
from
brute
to
man
confess
me
yet
in
man
i
find
my
worthiest
worship
where
man
is
a
youth
and
a
maid
a
youth
and
a
maid
nought
else
is
wanting
for
my
temple
every
clime
kneels
to
me
the
long
breaker
swells
and
falls
under
the
palms
mixed
with
the
merry
noise
of
savage
bridals
and
the
straight
brown
limbs
know
me
and
over
all
the
endless
plains
i
reign
and
by
the
tents
on
the
hot
sand
and
isles
am
queen
and
on
the
side
of
silent
mountains
where
the
white
cots
gleam
upon
the
green
hill
pastures
and
no
sound
but
the
thunder
of
the
avalanche
is
borne
to
the
listening
rocks
around
and
in
fair
lands
where
all
is
peace
where
thro
the
happy
hush
of
tranquil
summer
evenings
the
corn
or
thro
cool
arches
of
the
gadding
vines
the
lovers
stray
together
hand
in
hand
hymning
my
praise
and
by
the
stately
streets
of
echoing
cities
over
all
the
earth
palace
and
cot
mountain
and
plain
and
sea
the
burning
south
the
icy
north
the
old
and
immemorial
east
the
unbounded
west
no
new
god
comes
to
spoil
me
utterly
all
worship
and
are
mine
with
a
sweet
smile
upon
her
rosy
mouth
the
goddess
ceased
and
when
she
spake
no
more
the
silence
weighed
as
heavy
on
my
soul
as
when
it
takes
some
gracious
melody
and
leaves
the
ear
unsatisfied
and
longing
till
the
fount
of
sweetness
springs
again
but
while
i
stood
expectant
lo
a
fair
pale
form
drew
near
with
front
severe
and
wide
blue
eyes
which
bore
mild
wisdom
in
their
gaze
great
purity
shone
from
her
not
the
innocence
of
her
whom
first
i
saw
but
that
which
comes
from
wider
knowledge
which
restrains
the
tide
of
passionate
youth
and
leads
the
musing
soul
by
the
calm
deeps
of
wisdom
and
i
knew
my
eyes
had
seen
the
fair
the
virgin
queen
who
once
within
her
shining
parthenon
beheld
the
sages
kneel
she
with
clear
voice
and
coldly
sweet
yet
with
a
softness
too
as
doth
befit
a
virgin
she
does
right
to
boast
her
sway
my
sister
seeing
indeed
that
all
things
are
as
by
a
double
law
and
from
a
double
root
the
tree
of
life
springs
up
to
the
face
of
heaven
body
and
soul
matter
and
spirit
lower
joys
of
sense
and
higher
joys
of
thought
i
know
that
both
build
up
the
shrine
of
being
the
brute
sense
leaves
man
a
brute
but
winged
with
soaring
thought
mounts
to
high
heaven
the
unembodied
spirit
dwelling
alone
unmated
void
of
sense
is
impotent
and
yet
i
hold
there
is
far
off
but
not
too
far
for
mortal
reach
a
calmer
height
where
nearer
to
the
stars
thought
sits
alone
and
gazes
with
rapt
gaze
a
maiden
in
a
robe
of
white
who
brings
the
light
of
knowledge
down
and
draws
to
her
pontifical
eyes
a
bridge
of
gold
which
spans
from
earth
to
heaven
for
what
were
life
if
things
of
sense
were
all
for
those
large
souls
and
high
which
grudging
nature
has
shut
fast
within
unlovely
forms
or
those
from
whom
the
circuit
of
the
rapid
gliding
years
steals
the
brief
gift
of
beauty
shall
we
hold
with
idle
singers
all
the
treasure
of
hope
is
lost
with
youth
treacherous
youth
which
fades
and
flies
before
the
ripening
brain
crowns
life
with
wisdom
crown
nay
even
in
youth
is
it
not
more
to
walk
upon
the
heights
alone
the
cold
free
heights
and
mark
the
vale
lie
breathless
in
the
glare
or
hidden
and
blurred
by
cloud
and
storm
or
pestilence
and
war
creep
on
with
blood
and
death
while
the
soul
dwells
apart
upon
the
peaks
outfronts
the
sun
as
the
eagle
does
and
takes
the
coming
dawn
while
all
the
vale
is
dark
and
knows
the
springs
of
tiny
rivulets
hurrying
from
the
snows
which
soon
shall
swell
to
vast
resistless
floods
and
feed
the
oceans
which
divide
the
world
oh
ecstasy
oh
wonder
oh
delight
which
neither
the
wear
of
time
that
takes
all
else
the
smooth
and
rounded
cheek
of
youth
the
lightsome
step
the
warm
young
heart
which
beats
for
love
or
friend
the
treasure
of
hope
immeasurable
the
blood
which
makes
it
joy
to
be
ay
takes
them
all
and
leaves
us
naught
nor
yet
satiety
born
of
too
full
possession
takes
or
mars
oh
fair
delight
of
learning
which
grows
great
and
stronger
and
more
keen
for
slower
limbs
and
dimmer
eyes
and
loneliness
and
loss
of
lower
good
wealth
friendship
ay
and
love
when
the
swift
soul
turning
its
weary
gaze
from
the
old
vanished
joys
projects
itself
into
the
void
and
floats
in
empty
space
striving
to
reach
the
mystic
source
of
things
the
secrets
of
the
earth
and
sea
and
air
the
law
that
holds
the
process
of
the
suns
the
awful
depths
of
mind
and
thought
the
prime
unfathomable
mystery
of
god
is
there
then
any
who
holds
my
worship
cold
and
lifeless
nay
but
is
the
light
which
cheers
the
waning
life
love
thou
thy
love
brave
youth
cleave
to
thy
love
fair
maid
it
is
the
law
which
dominates
the
world
that
bids
ye
use
your
nature
but
when
now
the
fuller
tide
slackens
a
little
turn
your
calmer
eyes
to
the
fair
page
of
knowledge
it
is
power
i
give
and
power
is
precious
it
is
strength
to
live
careless
of
outward
shows
and
it
is
clearer
sight
to
know
the
rule
of
life
the
eternal
scheme
and
knowing
it
to
do
and
not
to
err
and
doing
to
be
blest
the
calm
voice
soared
higher
and
higher
to
the
close
the
cold
clear
accents
fired
as
by
a
hidden
fire
glowed
into
life
and
tenderness
and
throbbed
as
with
some
spiritual
ecstasy
sweeter
than
that
of
love
but
as
they
died
i
heard
an
ampler
voice
and
looking
marked
a
fair
and
gracious
form
she
seemed
a
queen
who
ruled
gods
and
men
the
majesty
of
perfect
womanhood
no
opening
bud
of
beauty
but
the
full
consummate
flower
was
hers
and
from
her
mild
large
eyes
looked
forth
gentle
command
and
motherhood
and
home
and
pure
affection
awe
and
reverence
me
as
i
knew
my
eyes
had
looked
on
sovereign
heré
mother
of
the
gods
she
with
clear
rounded
utterance
sweet
and
calm
i
know
love
fruit
is
good
and
fair
to
see
and
taste
if
any
gain
it
and
i
know
how
brief
life
which
when
it
ends
may
change
to
thirst
for
knowledge
and
i
know
how
fair
the
realm
of
mind
wherein
the
soul
thirsting
to
know
wings
its
impetuous
way
beyond
the
bounds
of
thought
and
yet
i
hold
there
is
a
higher
bliss
than
these
which
fits
a
mortal
life
compact
of
body
and
soul
and
therefore
a
calm
path
which
lies
before
the
feet
thro
common
ways
and
undistinguished
crowds
of
toiling
men
and
yet
is
hard
to
tread
tho
seeming
smooth
and
yet
tho
level
earns
a
worthier
crown
for
knowledge
is
a
steep
which
few
may
climb
while
duty
is
a
path
which
all
may
tread
and
if
the
soul
of
life
and
thought
be
this
how
best
to
speed
the
mighty
scheme
which
still
fares
onward
day
by
day
the
life
of
the
world
which
is
the
sum
of
petty
lives
that
live
and
die
so
this
may
live
how
then
shall
each
of
that
great
multitude
of
faithful
souls
who
walk
not
on
the
heights
fulfil
himself
but
by
the
duteous
life
which
looks
not
forth
beyond
its
narrow
sphere
and
finds
its
work
and
works
it
out
content
this
done
to
fall
and
perish
if
fate
will
so
the
great
scheme
goes
onward
wherefore
am
i
queen
in
heaven
and
earth
whose
realm
is
duty
bearing
rule
more
constant
and
more
wide
than
those
whose
words
thou
heardest
last
mine
are
the
striving
souls
of
fathers
toiling
day
by
day
obscure
and
unrewarded
save
by
their
own
hearts
mid
wranglings
of
the
forum
or
the
mart
who
long
for
joys
of
thought
and
yet
must
toil
unmurmuring
thro
dull
lives
from
youth
to
age
who
haply
might
have
worn
instead
the
crown
of
honour
and
of
fame
mine
the
fair
mothers
who
for
the
love
of
children
and
of
home
when
passion
dies
expend
their
toilful
years
in
loving
labour
sweetened
by
the
sense
of
duty
mine
the
statesman
who
toils
on
thro
vigilant
nights
and
days
guiding
his
state
yet
finds
no
gratitude
and
those
white
souls
who
give
themselves
for
others
all
their
years
in
trivial
tasks
of
pity
the
fine
growths
of
man
and
time
are
mine
and
spend
themselves
for
me
and
for
the
mystical
end
which
lies
beyond
their
gaze
and
mine
and
yet
is
good
tho
hidden
from
men
and
gods
for
as
the
flower
of
the
bright
with
varied
hues
is
for
a
day
then
fades
and
leaves
behind
fairness
nor
fruit
while
the
green
tiny
tuft
swells
to
the
purple
of
the
clustering
grape
or
golden
waves
of
wheat
so
lives
of
men
which
show
most
splendid
fade
and
are
deceased
and
leave
no
trace
while
those
unmarked
unseen
which
no
man
recks
of
rear
the
stately
tree
of
knowledge
not
for
itself
sought
out
but
found
in
the
dusty
ways
of
life
a
fairer
growth
than
springs
in
cloistered
shades
and
from
the
sum
of
duty
blooms
sweeter
and
more
divine
the
fair
ideal
of
the
race
than
comes
from
glittering
gains
of
learning
life
full
life
reared
from
homely
earth
rooted
in
duty
and
thro
long
calm
years
bearing
its
load
of
healthful
energies
stretching
its
arms
on
all
sides
fed
with
dews
of
cheerful
sacrifice
and
clouds
of
care
and
rain
of
useful
tears
warmed
by
the
sun
of
calm
affection
till
it
breathes
itself
in
perfume
to
the
heavens
this
is
the
prize
i
hold
most
dear
more
precious
than
the
fruit
of
knowledge
or
of
love
the
goddess
ceased
as
dies
some
gracious
harmony
the
child
of
wedded
themes
which
single
and
alone
were
discords
but
united
breathe
a
sound
sweet
as
the
sounds
of
heaven
and
then
stood
forth
the
last
of
the
gods
i
saw
the
first
in
rank
and
dignity
and
beauty
the
young
god
who
grows
not
old
the
light
of
heaven
and
earth
the
worker
from
afar
who
sends
the
fire
of
inspiration
to
the
bard
and
bathes
the
world
in
hues
of
heaven
the
golden
link
between
high
god
and
man
with
a
sweet
voice
whose
every
note
was
sweetest
melody
the
melody
has
fled
the
words
remain
apollo
sang
i
know
how
fair
the
face
of
purity
i
know
the
treasure
of
strength
i
know
the
charm
of
love
the
calmer
grace
of
wisdom
and
of
duteous
lives
and
yet
there
is
a
loftier
height
than
these
there
is
a
height
higher
than
mortal
thought
there
is
a
love
warmer
than
mortal
love
there
is
a
life
which
taketh
not
its
hues
from
earth
or
earthly
things
and
so
grows
pure
and
higher
than
the
petty
cares
of
men
and
is
a
blessed
life
and
glorified
oh
white
young
souls
strain
upward
upward
still
even
to
the
heavenly
source
of
purity
brave
hearts
bear
on
and
suffer
strike
for
right
strong
arms
and
hew
down
wrong
the
world
hath
need
of
all
of
you
the
sensual
wrongful
world
hath
need
of
you
and
of
thee
too
fair
love
oh
lovers
cling
together
the
old
world
is
full
of
hate
sweeten
it
draw
in
one
two
separate
chords
of
life
and
from
the
bond
of
twin
souls
lost
in
harmony
create

on

the

there
is
a

work
than
yours
to
have
looked
upon
the

the
unknown
and
perfect
beauty
to
have
heard
the
voice
of
godhead
in

in

have
known
him
in

circling

fulfilled

essence

the
hand
on

on

falling

celestial
traces

from
reed

draws
out
faint
echoes
of
the
voice
divine

bring
god
nearer
to
a
faithless
world

higher
still
and
fairer
and
more
blest
to
be
his
seer
his
prophet

be
the
voice
of
the
ineffable
word
to
be
the
glass
of
the
ineffable
light
and
bring
them
down
to
bless
the
earth
set
in
a
shrine
of
song
for
knowledge
is
a
barren
tree
and
bare
bereft
of
god
and
duty
but
a
word
and
strength
but
tyranny
and
love
desire
and
purity
a
folly
and
the
soul
which
brings
down
god
to
man
the
light
to
the
world
he
is
the
maker
and
is
blest
is
blest
he
ended
and
i
felt
my
soul
grow
faint
with
too
much
sweetness
in
a
mist
of
grace
they
faded
that
bright
company
and
seemed
to
melt
into
each
other
and
shape
themselves
into
new
forms
and
those
fair
goddesses
blent
in
a
perfect
woman
all
the
calm
high
motherhood
of
heré
the
sweet
smile
of
cypris
fair
athené
earnest
eyes
and
the
young
purity
of
artemis
blent
in
a
perfect
woman
and
in
her
arms
fused
by
some
cosmic
interlacing
curves
of
beauty
into
a
new
innocence
a
child
with
eyes
divine
a
little
child
a
little
child
no
more
and
those
great
gods
of
power
and
beauty
left
a
heavenly
form
strong
not
to
act
but
suffer
fair
and
meek
not
proud
and
eager
with
soft
eyes
of
grace
not
bold
with
joyous
youth
and
for
the
fire
of
song
and
for
the
happy
careless
life
a
sorrowful
pilgrimage
changed
yet
the
same
only
diviner
far
and
keeping
still
the
life
and
the
sacrifice
and
when
these
faded
wholly
at
my
side
tho
hidden
before
by
those
forms
i
was
aware
once
more
of
her
my
guide
psyche
who
had
not
left
me
floating
near
on
golden
wings
and
all
the
plains
of
heaven
were
left
to
us
me
and
my
soul
alone
then
when
my
thought
revived
again
i
said
whispering
but
zeus
i
saw
not
the
prime
source
and
sire
of
all
the
gods
and
she
bent
low
with
downcast
eyes
nay
thou
hast
seen
of
him
all
that
thine
eyes
can
bear
in
those
fair
forms
which
are
but
parts
of
him
and
are
indeed
attributes
of
the
substance
which
supports
the
universe
of
things
the
soul
of
the
world
the
stream
which
flows
eternal
from
no
source
into
no
sea
his
purity
his
strength
his
love
his
knowledge
his
unchanging
rule
of
duty
thou
hast
seen
only
a
part
and
not
the
whole
being
a
finite
mind
too
weak
for
infinite
thought
nor
couldst
thou
see
all
of
him
visible
to
mortal
sight
wouldst
thou
see
all
his
essence
since
the
gods
glorified
essences
of
human
mould
who
are
but
zeus
made
visible
to
men
see
him
not
wholly
only
some
thin
edge
and
halo
of
his
glory
nor
know
they
what
vast
and
unsuspected
universes
lie
beyond
thought
where
yet
he
rules
like
those
vast
suns
we
can
not
see
round
which
our
sun
moves
with
his
system
or
those
darker
still
which
not
even
thus
we
know
but
yet
exist
tho
no
eye
marks
nor
thought
itself
and
lurk
in
the
awful
depths
of
space
or
that
which
is
not
orbed
as
yet
but
indiscrete
confused
sown
thro
the
void
the
faintest
gleam
of
light
which
sets
itself
to
be
and
yet
is
he
there
too
and
rules
none
seeing
but
sometimes
to
this
our
heaven
which
is
so
like
to
earth
but
nearer
to
him
for
awhile
he
shows
some
gleam
of
his
own
brightness
and
methinks
it
cometh
soon
but
thou
if
thou
shouldst
gaze
thy
life
will
rush
to
his
the
tiny
spark
absorbed
in
that
full
blaze
and
what
there
is
of
mortal
fall
from
thee
but
i
oh
soul
what
holdeth
life
more
precious
than
to
know
the
giver
and
to
die
then
she
behold
look
upward
and
adore
and
with
the
word
unhasting
undelaying
gradual
sure
the
floating
cloud
which
clothed
the
hidden
peak
rose
slow
in
awful
silence
laying
bare
spire
after
rocky
spire
snow
after
snow
whiter
and
yet
more
dreadful
till
at
last
it
left
the
summit
clear
then
with
a
bound
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
in
the
flash
of
a
thought
i
knew
an
awful
effluence
of
light
formless
ineffable
perfect
burst
on
me
and
flood
my
being
round
and
take
my
life
into
itself
i
saw
my
guide
bent
down
prostrate
her
wings
before
her
face
and
then
no
more
but
when
i
woke
from
my
long
trance
behold
it
was
no
longer
tartarus
nor
hades
nor
olympus
but
the
bare
and
unideal
aspect
of
the
fields
which
spring
not
yet
had
kissed
the
strange
old
earth
so
far
more
fabulous
now
than
in
the
days
when
man
was
young
nor
yet
the
mystery
of
time
and
fate
transformed
it
from
the
hills
the
long
night
fled
at
last
the
unclouded
sun
the
dear
fair
sun
leapt
upward
swift
and
smote
my
sight
with
rays
of
gold
and
pierced
my
brain
with
too
much
light
ere
my
entrancèd
eyes
could
hide
themselves
and
i
was
on
the
earth
dreaming
the
dream
of
life
again
as
late
i
dreamed
the
dream
of
death
another
day
dawned
on
the
race
of
men
another
world
new
heavens
and
new
earth
and
as
i
went
across
the
lightening
fields
upon
a
bank
i
saw
a
single
snowdrop
glance
and
bring
promise
of
spring
and
keeping
my
old
thought
in
the
old
fair
hellenic
vesture
dressed
i
felt
myself
a
ghost
and
seemed
to
be
now
fair
adonis
hasting
to
the
arms
of
his
lost
love
now
sad
persephone
restored
to
mother
earth
or
that
high
shade
orpheus
who
gave
up
heaven
to
save
his
love
and
is
rewarded
or
young
marsyas
who
spent
his
youth
and
life
for
song
and
yet
was
happy
though
in
torture
or
the
fair
and
dreaming
youth
i
saw
who
still
awaits
hopeful
the
unveiling
heaven
when
he
shall
see
his
fair
ideal
love
the
birds
sang
blithe
there
came
a
tinkling
from
the
waking
fold
and
on
the
hillside
from
the
cot
a
girl
tripped
singing
with
her
pitcher
all
the
sounds
and
thoughts
which
still
are
beautiful
youth
song
dawn
spring
renewal
and
my
soul
was
glad
of
all
the
freshness
and
i
felt
again
the
youth
and
of
the
world
and
thought
which
feigned
those
fair
and
gracious
fantasies
for
every
dawn
that
breaks
brings
a
new
world
and
every
budding
bosom
a
new
life
these
fair
tales
which
we
know
so
beautiful
show
only
finer
than
our
lives
because
their
voice
was
clearer
and
they
found
a
sacred
bard
to
sing
them
we
are
pent
who
sing
by
all
the
garnered
wealth
of
ages
of
past
song
we
have
no
more
the
world
to
choose
from
who
we
turn
tread
through
old
thoughts
and
fair
yet
must
we
sing
we
have
no
choice
and
if
more
hard
the
toil
in
noon
when
all
is
clear
than
in
the
fresh
white
mists
of
early
morn
yet
do
we
find
achievement
its
own
guerdon
and
at
last
the
rounder
song
of
manhood
grows
more
sweet
than
the
high
note
of
youth
for
age
long
age
nought
else
divides
us
from
the
fresh
young
days
which
men
call
ancient
seeing
that
we
in
turn
shall
one
day
be
time
ancients
and
inspire
the
wiser
higher
race
which
yet
shall
sing
because
to
sing
is
human
and
high
thought
grows
rhythmic
ere
its
close
nought
else
there
is
but
that
weird
beat
of
time
which
doth
disjoin
from
hellas
how
should
any
hold
those
precious
scriptures
only
tales
of
strange
impossible
torments
and
false
gods
of
men
and
monsters
in
some
brainless
dream
coherent
yet
unmeaning
linked
together
by
some
false
skein
of
song
nay
evermore
all
things
and
thoughts
both
new
and
old
are
writ
upon
the
unchanging
human
heart
and
soul
has
passion
still
no
prisoners
pine
there
now
no
lives
which
fierce
love
sinking
into
lust
has
drowned
at
last
in
tears
and
blood
plunged
down
to
the
lowest
depths
of
hell
have
not
strong
will
and
high
ambition
rotted
into
greed
and
wrong
for
any
as
of
old
and
whelmed
the
struggling
soul
in
ruin
hell
lies
near
around
us
as
does
heaven
and
in
the
world
which
is
our
hades
still
the
chequered
souls
compact
of
good
and
ill
not
all
accurst
nor
altogether
blest
a
few
brief
years
travel
the
little
journey
of
their
lives
they
know
not
to
what
end
the
weary
woman
sunk
deep
in
ease
and
sated
with
her
life
much
loved
and
yet
unloving
pines
as
helen
still
the
poet
strives
and
sings
and
hears
apollo
music
and
grows
dumb
and
suffers
yet
is
happy
still
the
young
fond
dreamer
seeks
his
high
ideal
love
and
finds
her
name
is
death
still
doth
the
fair
and
innocent
life
bound
naked
to
the
rock
redeem
the
race
still
the
gay
tempter
goes
and
leaves
his
victim
stone
still
doth
pain
bind
men
souls
in
closer
links
of
lovingness
than
death
itself
can
sever
still
the
sight
of
too
great
beauty
blinds
us
and
we
lose
the
sense
of
earthly
splendours
gaining
heaven
and
still
the
skies
are
opened
as
of
old
to
the
entrancèd
gaze
ay
nearer
far
and
brighter
than
of
yore
and
might
is
there
and
infinite
purity
is
there
and
high
eternal
wisdom
and
the
calm
clear
face
of
duty
and
a
higher
stronger
love
and
light
in
one
and
a
new
reverend
name
greater
than
any
and
combining
all
and
over
all
veiled
with
a
veil
of
cloud
god
set
far
off
too
bright
for
mortal
eyes
and
always
always
with
each
soul
that
comes
and
goes
comes
that
fair
form
which
was
my
guide
hovering
with
golden
wings
and
eyes
divine
above
the
bed
of
birth
the
bed
of
death
still
breathing
heavenly
airs
of
deathless
love
for
while
a
youth
is
lost
in
soaring
thought
and
while
a
maid
grows
sweet
and
beautiful
and
while
a
coming
lights
the
earth
and
while
a
child
and
while
a
flower
is
born
and
while
one
wrong
cries
for
redress
and
finds
a
soul
to
answer
still
the
world
is
young
