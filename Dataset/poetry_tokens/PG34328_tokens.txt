foreword
we
all
of
us
know
that
the
ordinary
man
and
woman
the
people
we
brush
against
in
street
cars
the
people
who
read
the
funnies
the
people
who
are
like
us
are
capable
of
the
profoundest
depths
of
feeling
and
the
noblest
aspirations
but
it
is
only
on
the
rarest
occasions
that
we
happen
to
see
one
of
them
at
it
so
to
speak
and
when
we
do
we
have
a
certain
sense
of
shame
at
intruding
on
something
that
really
should
be
private
between
him
and
his
god
the
artist
enables
us
to
see
this
ordinary
man
and
woman
in
the
moments
when
they
are
not
ordinary
without
any
of
this
sense
of
intrusion
i
think
mona
gould
in
most
of
the
verses
in
this
volume
has
been
exceptionally
successful
in
this
kind
of
revelation
and
i
think
canada
needs
it
a
number
of
these
verses
have
been
published
in
saturday
night
during
the
term
of
my
editorship
and
i
am
very
glad
that
they
are
now
to
have
a
more
permanent

remember
how
it
was
last

incredibly
orange
little
orange
willow
switches
hardly

remember
the
white
shore
road
and
the
blue
water
in
the
bay
still
fretted
with
clotted
snow
at
the
sand
edge
the
sky
was
a
light
high
blue
and
all
the
clouds
were
little
and
frisky
and
we
kept
making
wagers
about
the
willows
at
every
curve
in
the
road
darling
the
colour
has
come

i

you
would

liked

i
know
when
you
are
gone
to
care
if
shoes
are
black
or
fawn
to
match
my
lip
rouge
with
a
ring
to
pin
gardenias
at
my
breast
to
brush
my
hair
till
it
is
sleek
as
carded
silk
and
in
my
eyes
to
wear
a
look
of
glad
surprise
nightly
still
i
dress
for
you
because
i
know
you
want
me
to
litany
for
the
lonely
you
warmth
and
laughter
you
the
good
time
you
security
and
sleeping
with
arms
and
no
night
and
the
dark
shut
out
you
pain
drowned
in
joy
and
laughter
from
the
heart
you
loving
kindness
the
look
of
dear
acquaintance
and
a
hand
to
hold
always
this
was
my
brother
for
howard
mctavish
killed
in
action
at
dieppe
this
was
my
brother
at
dieppe
quietly
a
hero
who
gave
his
life
like
a
gift
withholding
nothing
his
youth
his
love
his
enjoyment
of
being
alive
his
future
like
a
book
with
half
the
pages
still
uncut
this
was
my
brother
at
dieppe
the
one
who
built
me
a
doll
house
when
i
was
seven
complete
to
the
last
small
picture
frame
nothing
forgotten
he
was
awfully
good
at
fixing
things
at
stepping
into
the
breach
when
he
was
needed
that
what
he
did
at
dieppe
he
was
needed
and
even
death
must
have
been
a
little
shamed
at
his
eagerness
nostaglia
what
nostaglia
mums
nostaglia
oh
you
mean
nostalgia
son
let
me
see
how
can
i
explain
it
to
you
this
nostaglia
as
good
a
word
for
it
as
any
well
darling
nostaglia
is
that
funny
feeling
you
get
going
down
in
elevators
only
you
not
in
an
elevator
it
just
comes
everything
sort
of
goes
away
from
you
and
you
feel
a
little
scared
and
a
lot
lonely
it
like
this
remember
tippy
the
little
brown
dog
and
how
we
loved
him
and
how
he
ran
just
a
little
ahead
of
you
just
a
little
too
fast
and
you
chasing
him
on
your
tricycle
and
the
curb
came
and
you
stopped
and
tip
and
he
just
lay
there
and
the
look
was
gone
out
of
his
eyes
and
we
tucked
him
away
in
a
brown
bean
carton
under
the
apple
tree
and
the
house
was
awfully
quiet
without
him
that
was
nostalgia
and
remember
when
we
did
the
plays
and
you
were
wakefield
in
the
jalna
one
and
we
used
to
prop
up
your
lines
over
the
basin
in
the
bathroom
and
you
learned
them
while
you
brushed
your
teeth
and
you
followed
me
round
the
kitchen
while
i
made
peanut
butter
cookies
and
took
the
part
of
renny
at
the
same
time
and
it
was
pretty
exciting
and
mixed
up
and
very
wonderful
and
the
smell
of
remember
that
and
the
keen
edge
of
being
treated
like
a
grownup
and
the
first
taste
of
applause
and
the
feeling
of
power
when
you
your
cue
right
on
the
nose
and
then
it
was
all
over
and
there
were
any
more
rehearsals
and
all
the
excitement
was
quenched
and
school
seemed
uncommonly
dull
and
one
night
you
went
back
to
the
theatre
to
get
your
little
riding
boots
and
it
was
deserted
and
dusty
but
that
lovely
smell
of
still
lingered
in
the
and
you
stood
there
for
a
minute
with
one
boot
in
your
hand
and
let
it
just
roll
over
you
the
play
the
lights
the
fun
and
then
you
gave
yourself
a
little
shake
and
picked
up
the
other
boot
and
felt
well
that
was
nostaglia
and
then
remember
the
time
in
the
union
station
and
we
been
down
to
gammie
together
because
daddy
was
there
on
last
leave
and
he
met
us
at
the
train
and
taken
you
to
the
mess
and
you
seen
the
bunk
where
he
slept
and
played
a
game
of
darts
and
had
a
coke
with
him
in
the
canteen
and
gone
to
a
movie
and
felt
very
proud
when
we
came
out
because
your
father
looked
so
impressive
in
his
uniform
and
because
we
agreed
there
be
no
fuss
no
tears
no
last
daddy
had
just
said
so
long
sport
i
see
you
in
the
funny
papers
but
for
once
it
was
funny
and
you
were
still
holding
the
little
metal
disc
in
your
hand
daddy
had
stamped
out
for
you
with
your
name
on
it
and
you
did
seem
to
want
to
put
it
out
of
your
hand
not
even
in
your
pocket
and
you
looked
at
me
across
a
great
black
gap
and
even
i
could
fix
it
this
time
and
that
was
nostalgia
toujours
gai
for
jamie
of
the
he
has
outsoared
the
shadow
of
our
night
bravely
he
kept
his
tryst
with
death
who
somehow
knew
it
would
come
to
pass
but
he
tipped
his
cap
at
a
rakish
slant
and
he
gave
himself
a
smile
in
the
glass
if
his
hand
was
clenched
there
was
none
to
see
if
his
heart
was
sore
for
the
home
he
missed
and
the
eager
face
of
his
dearest
love
and
her
flying
hair
and
the
lips
he
kissed
he
had
made
for
himself
from
a
little
phrase
a
shield
and
a
buckler
to
save
the
day
and
the
little
phrase
was
a
bit
of
himself
and
he
laughed
when
he
said
it
toujours
gai
that
girl
in
hong
kong
that
girl
in
hong
kong
she
must
have
loved
frivolous
things
too
collected
crystal
brandy
glasses
cut
flowers
for
a
white
bowl
and
dreamed
the
incredible
dreams
that
all
girls
do
she
might
have
been
married
tucked
children
off
to
bed
at
night
told
stories
to
put
candles
on
the
table
worn
a
white
lace
dress
proud
to
be
slender
and
desirable
and
womanly
that
girl
in
hong
kong
she
felt
safe
and
secure
and
thankful
for
security
maybe
she
chose
a
gay
almost
boastfully
red
lipstick
because
it
was
christmas
how
pitiful
is
paint
on
the
mouth
of
one
dead
image
you
ca
put
it
into
words
this
feeling
of
remembering
it
comes
up
like
a
little
mist
between
you
and
your
world
so
that
suddenly
a
flurry
of
leaves
or
pewter
mugs
shining
in
a
shop
window
can
make
you
stand
quietly
till
this
ache
passes
over
convoy
suddenly
my
darling
out
of
a
deep
sleep
i
could
smell
the
sea
and
a
salt
wind
blowing
and
i
knew
that
you
had
gone
from
me
answer
me
answer
me
this
what
do
lovers
do
when
there
is
no
more
meeting
when
night
comes
down
quietly
and
the
moon
rises
over
the
fields
even
the
dew
on
the
grass
must
be
pressed
down
by
the
eager
feet
of
the
returning
dreamers
hand
turned
against
hand
like
two
children
coming
back
to
a
garden
voices
soft
and
anxious
and
blurred
with
their
intolerable
longing
answer
me
this
what
do
lovers
do
when
there
is
no
more
meeting
immortality
immortality
it
such
a
big
word
i
always
thought
it
was
something
tremendous
big
like
a
cathedral
or
the
sea
now
i
think
it
little
but
very
certain
sometimes
it
in
a
ring
or
a
pair
of
wings
or
the
badge
off
a
tanker
cap
or
a
kiss
sometimes
it
a
cable
safe
and
well
all
my
love
sometimes
it
a
child
how
he
turns
his
head
the
shape
of
his
hands
his
laugh
with
the
head
thrown
back
and
joy
like
a
shining
sword
cutting
the
dark
immortality
it
what
goes
on
it
what
marches
on
after
the
march
is
over
it
wings
in
the
sky
after
the
plane
is
down
it
tears
and
laughter
and
beauty
burning
like
a
star
alive
in
the
heart
forever

called

remember
i
borrowed
your
handkerchief
to
tie
on

head
that
we
might
go
in

and
dark
and
warm
and
still
with
the
whisper

murmuring
and
we
stood
at
the
shrine
of

to
light
a
candle
against
the
day
too
terribly
soon
when
a
boat
would
sail
and
you
held
my
hand
and
forgot
to
pray
and
seemed
so
dear
so
precious
so
lovely
so
brief
and
fair

whispered

little

age
after

lean
again

of
lads
like
you
who
wear
their
wings
and
find
these
things
as
wonderful

they
had
seemed

shakespeare

it

lets
you
in
on
a
miracle
promise
we
used
to
say
oh
just
in
fun
that
when
the
time
came
we
would
run
away
together
just
the
two
and
live
like
all
good
pixies
do
under
a
toadstool
you
laughed
and
said
we
get
quite
tipsy
on
rain
cocktails
and
we
wander
here
and
wander
there
and
i
with
flowers
in
my
hair
you
promised
when
you
went
away
you
come
for
me
and
on
that
day
we
seek
the
kindly
farthest
star
where
all
the
other
lovers
are
you
said
just
death
can
keep
me
from
darling
i
know
you
meant
to
come
tasting
the
earth
and
the
wind
went
over
the
top
of
the
birch
trees
like
a
great
hand
stirring
their
feathery
leaves
and
weaving
violet
shadows
on
their
shining
surface
lying
flat
on
the
young
grass
stretched
out
very
tall
and
feeling
wonderfully
magnificent
i
listened
to
my
own
heart
beating
darling
darling
said
my
heart
pressed
against
the
warm
earth
love
is
beautiful
and
love
will
die
but
can
it
be
so
terrible
a
thing
for
love
to
sleep
in
this
velvet
earth
i
pressed
my
face
against
the
fallen
leaves
and
felt
the
sun
tangled
in
my
blowing
hair
and
felt
the
sun
burning
down
into
my
very
bones
and
knew
suddenly
with
a
terrible
aching
certainty
that
it
was
so
love
is
beautiful
and
love
will
die
said
my
heart
and
even
the
dark
earth
was
little
comfort
spring
sunday
in
a
small
town
they
having
church
parade
the
boy
scouts
and
the
girl
guides
the
cubs
and
the
brownies
are
all
out
full
force
the
uncertain
fumbling
band
begins
a
staggering
march
and
off
they
go
curling
in
a
snaky
line
round
the
corner
from
the
market
square
under
the
old
town
clock
all
the
people
in
town
seem
to
have
hurried
down
to
one
spot
to
see
their
young
hopefuls
swinging
past
they
do
march
any
too
well
either
but
that
is
noticed
there
they
go
up
the
steps
of
the
old
gray
church
and
in
at
the
door
there
is
any
need
for
tears
pushing
up
to
the
surface
but
they
do
the
peace
of
it
the
ironic
terrible
sense
of
security
the
threat
under
the
dream
let
the
band
play
let
the
children
march
let
the
parents
weep
ghost
of
new
year
eve
a
dear
ghost
a
young
ghost
walks
this
night
clad
not
in
holy
mail
robed
not
in
white
nothing
like
a
halo
round
his
brown
head
laughter
on
his
young
lips
whimsical
and
red
wearing
old
flannel
slacks
jacket
sleeve
torn
sneakers
on
his
swift
feet
scuffed
and
a
dear
ghost
a
young
ghost
in
hand
pockets
full
of
charcoal
militant
you
stand
lip
caught
between
teeth
beautiful
and
white
eyes
full
of
shining
dreams
on
this
night
a
dear
ghost
a
young
ghost
walks
this
eve
if
he
finds
you
paintable
he
will
touch
your
sleeve
saying
as
the
wind
would
please
stand
still
sketching
you
and
vanishing
over
some
hill
quiet
has
come
down
owen
sound
quiet
has
come
down
over
this
little
village
as
if
a
nun
saying
her
beads
had
asked
for
peace
and
it
been
granted
a
white
sort
of
quiet
having
to
do
with
the
snow
and
the
little
necklace
of
lights
on
the
main
street
and
the
white
prows
of
the
fleet
in
the
harbour
silent
and
folded
in
like
giant
gulls
almost
the
whiteness
of
this
quiet
is
too
beautiful
to
be
borne
were
it
not
for
the
ebony
of
the
branches
and
the
dark
arm
of
a
church
spire
and
your
black
hair
like
a
dark
bird
flying
hands
hands
have
a
way
of
betraying
things
i
found
this
out
in
a
small
strange
way
you
touched
my
face
the
other
day
rain
in
the
city
rain
even
in
the
city
it
has
the
smell
of
the
country
wet
grasses
thorny
hedges
and
chestnuts
shaking
down
their
polished
brownness
and
ghosts
of
apple
trees
i
swear
they
haunt
the
city
streets
and
fling
their
sweetness
over
formal
lawns
and
stiff
uncompromising
dahlia
beds
just
let
the
drops
come
stinging
down
against
your
eyelids
false
tears
that
tangle
in
your
lashes
making
blurs
of
all
the
lights
until
they
swim
like
harbour
lamps
up
through
the
larkspur
evening
feel
it
against
your
shins
the
stinging
slanting
rain
that
laces
all
the
gutters
with
its
swathes
of
glittering
brightness
feel
it
against
your
face
and
think
of
sudden
gusty
showers
a
little
horse
gleaming
neck
and
flanks
the
smell
of
rain
on
leather
the
smell
of
rain
on
saddle
soap
and
the
pearly
glitter
of
flying
hoofs
bound
for
the
stable
rain
even
in
the
city
it
has
the
smell
of
the
country
you
the
sower
of
seed
you
the
sower
of
seed
in
this
fertile
field
that
is
my
body
tenderly
shall
i
care
for
it
guard
it
from
heat
and
cold
and
sudden
change
only
the
softest
sun
shall
shine
on
it
in
careful
quietness
this
white
field
shall
sleep
dream
i
in
arrowy
adoration
of
the
time
your
seed
sown
in
the
field
that
is
my
body
quickening
to
life
in
the
secret
places
under
my
heart
and
whatever
the
yield
i
shall
deem
it
beautiful
sprung
from
your
seed
nightmare
mother
he
cried
out
to
me
in
the
night
and
i
knew
that
he
had
been
dreaming
some
dark
and
troubling
shadow
had
pressed
against
him
fearfully
and
i
turned
him
in
his
little
bed
and
he
drifted
into
quiet
sleep
but
who
are
we
to
turn
to
in
the
long
night
when
the
black
wings
beat
contact
what
is
this
mysterious
crying
flame
this
urge
deeper
than
the
curve
in
the
young
flesh
the
round
enchanting
turn
of
the
smooth
wrist
the
throat
white
as
the
under
side
of
a
poplar
leaf
and
just
as
fair
what
is
this
hunger
holy
and
terrible
spawned
in
the
marrow
of
the
white
bones
a
hunger
that
can
not
be
drowned
in
surf
breaking
on
a
white
beach
or
lost
in
the
wind
coursing
through
the
lane
of
trees
in
the
forest
what
is
the
spirit
to
do
chained
as
she
is
like
hooded
falcon
to
the
wrist
when
she
can
neither
rise
nor
fly
nor
sing
her
song
in
the
darkness
autumn
is
unfair
autumn
is
unfair
to
stir
again
in
lash
of
wood
smoke
scent
of
bitter
berries
the
ashes
of
desire
to
stir
and
prod
with
gnarled
unfriendly
fingers
the
leaves
piled
high
about
the
tender
roots
disturbing
the
sleeping
blossoms
oh
to
be
free
of
this
damaging
enchantment
of
russet
leaves
and
scarlet
thorny
hedges
even
to
walk
quite
swiftly
in
the
evenings
down
streets
pressing
the
cool
to
your
lips
is
not
enough
o
anodyne
of
snow
white
delivering
angel
or
rain
or
wind
or
any
single
thing
to
break
this
tenuous
leash
to
let
the
heart
sleep
lightly
as
the
brown
tulip
bulbs
to
let
the
heart
sleep
nocturne
when
lovers
lie
in
summer
grass
and
watch
the
cloud
ships
as
they
pass
love
is
a
blend
of
pain
and
bliss
somewhere
a
shadow
dark
and
tall
across
the
seems
to
fall
denying
joy
this
thing
will
go
it
will
not
stay
when
summer
goes
and
you
away
so
runs
the
thread
of
darkling
song
and
yet
within
each
other
eyes
they
drown
this
knowledge
and
disguise
the
shadowy
blight
so
each
to
each
they
turn
and
say
we
have
each
other
anyway

perceptibly
withdrawn
he
waged
his
little
struggle
agreeable
to
all
the
final
desperate
tries

affords
he
drifted
out
farther
away
you
could
even
reach
him
with
your
hand
finally
he
made
his
peace
with
death
just
for
a
second
up
from
the
sargasso
sea
of
kindly
opiates
he
came
living
and

somehow
reassuring

you

portrait
you
walked
in
your
your
gown
rustling
like
autumn
leaves
its
heavy
folds
of
delicate
silk
the
colour
of
apricots
you
might
have
been
the
ghost
of
a
great
lady
your
chin
held
rather
high
for
one
so
small
or
you
might
have
been
a
frail
fantastic
figurine
in
cloisonné
that
had
stepped
down
for
a
moment
from
a
louis
quinze
table
or
then
again
you
might
have
been
a
princess
who
had
lived
most
of
her
life
in
a
fairy
tale
for
children
then
you
would
have
worn
a
little
cap
of
pearls
and
your
small
enchanted
hands
would
have
been
heavy
with
emeralds
you
walked
in
your
in
your
gown
of
apricot
satin
and
if
you
had
disappeared
into
a
mirror
or
stepped
back
into
a
picture
frame
i
could
have
believed
in
you
caledon
no
nor
the
green
hills
of
ireland
could
be
lovelier
beautiful
are
the
caledon
hills
green
like
moss
is
green
and
gracious
and
and
the
little
trees
that
march
down
the
sides
of
the
hills
are
like
trees
cut
from
green
they
stand
very
straight
and
not
very
tall
and
their
ranks
are
beautifully
and
the
hordes
of
silly
sheep
crying
baa
baa
out
of
their
curious
black
faces
and
the
scottish
cattle
with
their
great
horns
and
the
horses
leaning
into
the
wind
on
the
very
all
these
are
part
of
caledon
coming
out
of
the
little
ski
cabin
under
the
first
few
stars
you
will
say
no
nor
the
green
hills
of
ireland
could
be
lovelier
you
being
dead
for
you
being
dead
are
not
aware
that
brittle
berries
strew
the
ground
and
how
the
wind
an
unleashed
hound
prowls
through
the
wood
it
must
be
very
still
and
deep
where
you
have
gone
your
gentle
sleep
must
be
a
lovely
dreamless
thing
no
horns
of
daybreak
reach
your
rest
no
muffled
drums
of
midnight
breast
your
dim
retreat
and
well
i
know
you
would
not
stir
beneath
the
snow
and
yet
the
first
lush
rain
of
spring
must
speak
to
you
must
dance
and
sing
across
your
heart
though
it
be
still
the
scent
of
hyacinth
must
fill
the
very
earth
the
birth
of
grass
be
like
the
feet
of
fauns
who
pass
in
mocking
masque
among
the
trees
though
you
should
walk
elysian
fields
i
somehow
know
that
even
there
you
still
must
smell
the
apple
trees
who
found
the
spring
so
brief
and
fair
dilemma
you
know
if
you
were
only
a
book
i
know
what
to
do
about
you
i
read
you
and
remember
you
and
tuck
you
away
on
my
but
since
you
are
a
bitter
sort
of
magic
that
twists
me
like
a
silly
skein
to
fit
your
latest
picture
of
me
what
am
i
to
do
about
you
ah
and
even
if
you
were
a
book
i
should
love
you
very
dearly
and
carry
you
about
with
me
in
my
coat
pocket
always
night
garden
here
is
a
silver
star
caught
in
the
meshes
of
the
moon
it
matters
not
soon
soon
across
the
greeny
darkness
of
the
garden
still
and
sweet
i
shall
hear
in
the
mist
of
the
evening
your
feet
you
are
coming
to
me
the
garden
is
drowned
in
a
dream
only
my
heart
is
awake
hurry
hurry
beloved
lest
it
quiver
and
break
some
quiet
day
perhaps
some
quiet
day
perhaps
when
i
am
dead
and
this
loud
world
is
but
a
whispered
echo
through
the
dark
cool
earth
that
spreads
above
my
head
i
shall
forget
that
i
have
ever
known
you
your
kisses
shall
become
inconsequent
as
flowers
and
grass
that
grow
above
my
grave
our
moments
shared
shall
crumble
down
to
dust
the
ring
upon
my
finger
turn
to
rust
there
shall
be
nothing
to
remind
me
then
i
shall
know
peace
unstirred
by
pain
or
song
turning
my
face
to
sleep
as
children
do
never
to
start
awake
and
cry
your
name
seeking
your
arms
to
shelter
me
from
fear
as
i
do
now
this
night
my
very
dear
cloister
the
young
priest
stood
holding
a
small
book
in
his
hands
under
a
tree
of
its
leafage
he
stood
very
still
remote
the
wind
whipping
his
long
robes
into
swirling
darkness
there
behind
cloistered
walls
the
war
was
unreal
a
distant
dragon
whose
fiery
breath
was
legend
just
for
a
minute
the
world
stood
still
imprisoned
in
the
pages
of
a
small
book
there
was
healing
in
the
sight
the
young
priest
reading
words
set
down
many
centuries
ago
oh
soon
soon
let
there
be
peace
over
the
whole
world
and
the
young
men
coming
back
to
their
books
