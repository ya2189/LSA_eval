delights
holding
them

prisoners

what
shall

me

and

side

brings

home
again
wood

i
there
is
a
flute
that
follows
me
from

to
tree
a
water
flute
a
spirit
sets
to
silver
lips
in
waterfalls
and
through
the
breath
of
violets
a
sparkling
music
calls
hither
halloo
oh
follow
down
leafy
hill
and
hollow
where
through
clear
swirls
with
feet
like
pearls
wade
up
the
country
girls
hither
halloo
oh
follow
ii
there
is
a
pipe
that
plays
to
me
from
tree
to

a
bramble
pipe
an
elfin
holds
to
golden
lips
in
berry
brakes
and
swinging
the

wolds

flickering
music
makes
come
over
come
over
the
clover
come
over

there
by
the
berries
with
cheeks
like
cherries
and
locks
with
which
the
warm
wind
merries
brown
girls
are
hilling
the
hay

over

and
away
come
over

over
success
how
some
succeed
who
have
least
need
in
that
they
make
no
effort
for
and
pluck
where
others
pluck
a
weed
the
burning
blossom
of
a
star
grown
from
no
earthly
seed
for
some
shall
reap
that
never
sow
and
some
shall
toil
and
not
attain
what
boots
it
in
ourselves
to
know
such
labor
here
is
not
in
vain
when
we
still
see
it
so
song
unto
the
portal
of
the
house
of
song
symbols
of
wrong
and
emblems
of
unrest
and
mottoes
of
despair
and
envious
jest
and
stony
masks
of
scorn
and
hate
belong
who
enters
here
shall
feel
his
soul
denied
all
welcome
lo
the
chiselled
form
of
love
that
stares
in
marble
on
the
shrine
above
the
tomb
of
beauty
where
he
dreamed
and
died
who
enters
here
shall
know
no
poppyflowers
of
rest
or
of
serene
content
only
sad
ghosts
of
music
and
of
scent
shall
mock
the
mind
with
their
remembered
powers
here
must
he
wait
till
striving
patience
carves
his
name
upon
the
floor
his
heart
blood
staining
one
dim
pane
the
more
in
fame
high
casement
while
he
sings
and
starves
the
old
spring
i
under
rocks
whereon
the
rose
like
a
strip
of
morning
glows
where
the
newt
drowses
on
the
twisted
root
and
the
brown
bees
humming
homeward
stop
to
suck
the
fern
and
gleaming
gloamward
drips
the
wildwood
spring
i
knew
drips
the
spring
my
boyhood
knew
ii
myrrh
and
music
everywhere
haunt
its
cascades
like
the
hair
that
a
naiad
tosses
cool
swimming
strangely
beautiful
with
white
fragrance
for
her
bosom
for
her
mouth
a
breath
of
song
under
leaf
and
branch
and
blossom
flows
the
woodland
spring
along
sparkling
singing
flows
along
iii
still
the
wet
wan
morns
may
touch
its
gray
rocks
perhaps
and
such
slender
stars
as
dusk
may
have
pierce
the
rose
that
roofs
its
wave
still
the
thrush
may
call
at
noontide
and
the
whippoorwill
at
night
nevermore
by
sun
or
moontide
shall
i
see
it
gliding
white
falling
flowing
wild
and
white
hills
of
the
west

of
the

gird
forest

nestling
bird

from
harm
when
on
your
tops
is
heard
storm

twilight

ye
the

under
the

of

soon
parts
of
your
lives

why
for
us
the
blighted
bloom
the
blossom
that
lies
withering
the
master
of
life
changeless
loom
hath
wrought
for
us
no
changeless
thing
where
grows
the
rose
of
fadeless
grace
wherethrough
the
spirit
manifests
the
fact
of
an
immortal
race
the
dream
on
which
religion
rests
where
buds
the
lily
of
our
faith
that
grows
for
us
in
unknown
wise
out
of
the
barren
dust
of
death
the
pregnant
bloom
of
paradise
in
heaven
so
near
that
flowers
know
that
flowers
see
how
near
and
thus
reflect
the
knowledge
here

of
love
and

unknown

their

through

beneath

hoods

see

begin
the

ideality
that
has
no

dead

all
things
have
power
to
hold
us
back
our
very
hopes
build
up
a
wall
of
doubt
whose
shadow
stretches
black
all
the
dreams
that
helped
us
once
become
dread
disappointments
that
oppose
dead
eyes
to
ours
and
lips
made
dumb
with
woes
the
thoughts
that
opened
doors
before
within
the
mind
house
hide
away
discouragement
hath
locked
each
door
for
aye
come
loss
more
frequently
than
gain
and
failure
than
success
until
the
spirit
struggle
to
attain
is
still
the
wood
witch
there
is
a
woodland
witch
who
lies
with
limbs
and
eyes
among
the
that
rank
the
slow
brook
bank
the
in
brass
and
blue
are
signs
she
works
her
sorcery
through
weird
wizard
characters
she
weaves
her
spells
by
under
forest
leaves
these
wait
her
word
like
imps
upon
the
gray
their
wings
of
lawn
and
gauze
their
bodies
gleamy
green
while
the
wet
sand
left
between
the
running
water
and
the
still
in
pansy
hues
and
daffodil
the
fancies
that
she
meditates
take
on
most
sumptuous
shapes
with
traits
like
butterflies
is
she
you
hear
whose
sleepy
rune
hummed
in
the
ear
of
silence
bees
and
beetles
purr
and
the
locusts
whirr
till
where
the
wood
is
very
lone
vague
monotone
meets
monotone
and
slumber
is
begot
and
born
a
faery
child
beneath
the
thorn
there
is
no
mortal
who
may
scorn
the
witchery
she
spreads
around
her
dim
demesne
wherein
is
bound
the
beauty
of
abandoned
time
as
some
sweet
thought
rhyme
and
rhyme
and
by
her
spell
you
shall
behold
the
blue
turn
gray
the
gray
turn
gold
of
hollow
heaven
and
the
brown
of
twilight
vistas
twinkled
down
with
and
in
the
gloom
feel
the
cool
vowels
of
perfume
of
weed
and
bloom
but
in
the
night
at
languid
rest
when
like
a
spirit
naked
breast
the
moon
slips
from
a
silver
mist
with
brow
and
wrist
if
you
should
see
her
rise
and
wave
you
welcome
ah
what
thing
shall
save
you
then
forevermore
her
slave
at
sunset
into
the
sunset
turquoise
marge
the
moon
dips
like
a
pearly
barge
enchantment
sails
through
magic
seas
to
fairyland
hesperides
over
the
hills
and
away
into
the
fields
in
gown
the
dusk
comes
slowly
down
her
apron
filled
with
stars
she
stands
and
one
or
two
slip
from
her
hands
over
the
hills
and
away
above
the
wood
black
caldron
bends
the
night
and
muttering
blends
the
dew
and
heat
whose
bubbles
make
the
mist
and
musk
that
haunt
the
brake
over
the
hills
and
away
oh
come
with
me
and
let
us
go
beyond
the
sunset
lying
low
beyond
the
twilight
and
the
night
into
love
kingdom
of
long
light
over
the
hills
and
away
may
the
golden
disks
of
the
that
spangle
the
woods
and
dance
no
gleam
of
gold
that
the
twilights
hold
is
strong
as
their
necromance
for
under
the
oaks
where
the
lead
the
golden
disks
of
the
are
the
may
own
utterance
the
azure
stars
of
the
bluet
bloom
that
sprinkle
the
woodland
trance
no
blink
of
blue
that
a
cloud
lets
through
is
sweet
as
their
countenance
for
over
the
knolls
that
the
woods
perfume
the
azure
stars
of
the
bluet
bloom
are
the
light
of
the
may
own
glance
with
her
wondering
words
and
her
looks
she
comes
in
a
sunbeam
of
a
gown
she
needs
but
think
and
the
blossoms
wink
but
look
and
they
shower
down
by
orchard
ways
where
the
hums
with
her
wondering
words
and
her
looks
she
comes
like
a
little
maid
to
town
the
wind
of
spring
the
wind
that
breathes
of
columbines
and
that
crowd
the
rocks
that
shakes
the
balsam
of
the
pines
with
music
from
his
flashing
locks
stops
at
my
city
door
and
knocks
he
calls
me
far
where
the
and
the
bloom
and
circled
by
the
amber
air
life
sits
with
beauty
and
perfume
weaving
the
new
web
of
her
loom
he
calls
me
where
the
waters
run
through
fronding
ferns
where
haunts
the
hern
and
sparkling
in
the
equal
sun
song
leans
beside
her
brimming
urn
and
dreams
the
dreams
that
love
shall
learn
the
wind
has
summoned
and
i
go
to
con
god
meaning
in
each
line
the
flowers
write
and
walking
slow
god
purpose
of
which
song
is
sign
the
wind
great
gusty
hand
in
mine
interpreted
what
magic
shall
solve
us
the
secret
of
beauty
that
born
for
an
hour
that
gleams
like
the
flight
of
an
egret
or
burns
like
the
scent
of
a
flower
with
death
for
a
dower
what
leaps
in
the
bosk
but
a
satyr
what
pipes
on
the
wind
but
a
faun
or
laughs
in
the
waters
that
scatter
but
limbs
of
a
nymph
who
is
gone
when
we
walk
in
the
dawn
what
sings
on
the
hills
but
a
fairy
or
sighs
in
the
fields
but
a
sprite
what
breathes
through
the
leaves
but
the
airy
soft
spirits
of
shadow
and
light
when
we
walk
in
the
night
behold
how
the
is
eager
to
draw
us
and
hold
us
and
claim
through
truths
of
the
dreams
that
beleaguer
her
soul
she
makes
ours
the
same
and
death
but
a
name
the
willow
bottom
lush
green
the
grass
that
grows
between
the
willows
of
the
verged
by
the
careless
water
tall
and
green
the
stand
the
cows
come
gently
here
to
browse
slow
through
the
sycamores
you
hear
a
dog
bark
from
a
house
with
cedars
round
its
doors
then
all
is
quiet
as
the
wings
of
the
high
buzzard
floating
there
anon
a
woman
voice
that
sings
an
old
air
a
flapping
cock
that
crows
and
then
heard
drowsy
through
the
rustling
corn
a
flutter
and
the
cackling
of
a
hen
within
a
barn
how
still
again
no
water
stirs
no
wind
is
heard
although
the
weeds
are
waved
a
little
and
from
burrs
drift
by
a
few
soft
seeds
so
drugged
with
sleep
and
dreams
that
you
expect
to
see
her
gliding
by
hummed
round
of
bees
through
blossoms
spilling
dew
the
spirit
of
july
the
old
barn
low
and
gray
between
the
orchard
and
the
spring
all
its
wide
windows
overflowing
hay
and
crannied
doors
the
old
barn
stands
deep
in
its
hay
the
leghorn
hides
a
round
white
nest
and
humming
soft
on
roof
and
rafter
or
its
sides
black
in
the
loft
the
building
hornet

along
its
cautiously
as
thieving
fingers
skulks
the
rat
or
in
warped
stalls
of
fragrant
timothy
gnaws
at
some
loosened
slat
or
passes
shadowy
a
dream
of
drouth
made
audible
before
its
door
hot
smooth
and
shrill
all
day
the
locust
sings
what
other
spell
shall
hold
it
lazier
still
than
the
long
day
now
tell
dusk
and
the
cricket
and
the
strain
of
and
of
frog
and
stars
that
burn
above
the
rich
west
ribbéd
stain
and
dropping
pasture
bars
and
up
the
lane
night
and
the
moon
and
katydid
and
of
the
boughs

mazy
shadows

the
thrid
and
sweet
breath
of
the
cows
and
the
lone
owl
here
hid
clearing
before
the
wind
with
stocks
the
pleated
crimson
hollyhocks
are
bending
and
smouldering
in
the
breaking
brown
above
the
hills
that
edge
the
town
the
day
is
ending
the
air
is
heavy
with
the
damp
and
one
by
one
each
cottage
lamp
is
lighted
infrequent
passers
of
the
street
stroll
on
or
stop
to
talk
or
greet
benighted
i
look
beyond
my
city
yard
and
watch
the
white
moon
struggling
hard
the
wind
is
driving
toward
the
east
a
wreck
of
pearl
all
cracked
and
creased
and
serried
at
times
the
moon
erupting
streaks
some
long
cloud
like
andean
peaks
that
double
volcano
chains
the
earthquake
scars
with
lava
veins
that
bubble
the
wind
that
blows
from
out
the
hills
is
like
a
woman
touch
that
stills
a
sorrow
the
moon
sits
high
with
many
a
star
in
the
deep
calm
and
fair
and
far
abides
requiem
i
no
more
for
him
where
hills
look
down
shall
morning
crown
her
rainy
brow
with
blossom
bands
whose
rosy
hands
drop
wild
flowers
of
the
breaking
skies
upon
the
sod
which
he
no
more
no
more
ii
no
more
for
him
where
waters
sleep
shall
evening
heap
the
long
gold
of
the
perfect
days
whose
pale
hand
lays
great
poppies
of
the
afterglow
upon
the
turf
he
rests
no
more
no
more
iii
no
more
for
him
where
woodlands
loom
shall
midnight
bloom
the
acres
of
the
blue
whose
brown
hands
strew
dead
leaves
of
darkness
hushed
and
deep
upon
the
grave
where
he
doth
no
more
no
more
iv
the
hills
that
morning
footsteps
wake
the
waves
that
take
a
brightness
from
the
eve
the
woods
which
night
broods
their
spirits
have
whose
parts
are
one
with
his
whose
mortal
part
is
done
whose

done
at
last
what
shall

him

to

a
dark
day
though
summer
walks
the
world
with
hours
for
her
guard
her
thoughts
have
clad
themselves
in
gray
and
wait
in
autumn
weedy
yard
and
where
the
larkspur
and
the
phlox
spread
carpets
she
pass
she
seems
to
stand
with
sombre
locks
bound
bleak
with
fall
flowers
whose
disks
the
trickling
wet
has
tinged
with
dingy
lustre
when
the
thin
leaves
the
frost
has
singed
or
with
slow
feet
gaunt
gold
blooms
of
marigolds
her
fingers
twist
she
seems
to
pass
with
fall
perfumes
and
dreams
of
sullen
rain
and
mist
fall
spirit
of
the
solitudes
who
comest
through
the
woods
with
fog
with
the
gloom
of
tawny
twilights
burdened
with
perfume
of
uplands
chilly
with
the
mist
and
all
the
beauty
of
the
cold
forests
crimsoning
thy
indolent
way
odorous
of
death
and
drowsy
with
decay
i
think
of
thee
as
seated
the
showers
of
languid
leaves
that
cover
up
the
flowers
the
little
whom
june
once
gave
wild
sweetness
to
as
to
a
tune
a
singer
gives
her
soul
wild
melody
watching
the
squirrel
store
his
granary
or
old
orchards
i
have
pictured
thee
thy
hair
profusion
blown
about
thy
back
one
lovely
shoulder
bathed
with
gipsy
black
upon
thy
palm
one
nestling
cheek
and
sweet
the
rosy
russets
tumbled
at
thy
feet
was
it
a
voice
lamenting
for
the
flowers
a
bird
that
sang
of
happier
hours
a
cricket
dirging
days
that
soon
must
die
or
did
the
ghost
of
summer
wander
by
undertone
ah
me
too
soon
the
autumn
comes
among
these
hills
too
soon
among
the
forest
gums
premonitory
flame
she
spills
bleak
melancholy
flame
that
kills
her
white
fogs
veil
the
morn
that
rims
with
wet
the
elfin
moons
and
like
exhausted
starlight
dims
the
last
slim
and
swoons
with
scents
of
hazy
afternoons
her
gray
mists
haunt
the
sunset
skies
and
build
the
west
cadaverous
fire
where
sorrow
sits
with
lonely
eyes
and
hands
that
wake
her
ancient
lyre
beside
the
ghost
of
dead
desire
conclusion
the
songs
love
sang
to
us
are
dead
yet
shall
he
sing
to
us
again
when
the
dull
days
are
wrapped
in
lead
and
the
red
woodland
drips
with
rain
the
lily
of
our
love
is
gone
that
touched
our
spring
with
golden
scent
now
in
the
garden
low
upon
the
way
its
stalk
is
bent
our
rose
of
dreams
is
passed
away
that
lit
our
summer
with
sweet
fire
the
storm
beats
bare
each
thorny
spray
and
its
dead
leaves
are
trod
in
mire
the
songs
love
sang
to
us
are
dead
yet
shall
he
sing
to
us
again
when
the
dull
days
are
wrapped
in
lead
and
the
red
woodland
drips
with
rain
the
marigold
of
memory
shall
fill
our
autumn
then
with
glow
haply
its
bitterness
will
be
sweeter
than
love
of
long
ago
the
cypress
of
forgetfulness
shall
haunt
our
winter
with
its
hue
the
apathy
to
us
not
less
dear
than
the
dreams
our
summer
knew
monochromes
i
the
last
rose
falls
wrecked
of
the
wind
and
rain
where
once
it
bloomed
the
thorns
alone
remain
dead
in
the
wet
the
slow
rain
strews
the
rose
the
day
was
dim
now
eve
comes
on
again
grave
as
a
life
weighed
down
by
many
woes
so
is
the
joy
dead
and
alive
the
pain
the
brown
leaf
flutters
where
the
green
leaf
died
bare
are
the
boughs
and
bleak
the
forest
side
the
wind
is
whirling
with
the
last
wild
leaf
the
eve
was
strange
now
dusk
comes
weird
and
wide
gaunt
as
a
life
that
lives
alone
with
grief
so
doth
the
hope
go
and
despair
abide
an
empty
nest
hangs
where
the
pled
along
the
west
the
dusk
dies
stormy
red
the
frost
is
subtle
as
a
serpent
breath
the
dusk
was
sad
now
night
is
overhead
grim
as
a
soul
brought
face
to
face
with
death
so
life
lives
on
when
love
its
life
lies
dead
ii
go
your
own
ways
who
shall
persuade
me
now
to
seek
with
high
face
for
a
star
of
hope
or
up
endeavor
unsubmissive
slope
advance
a
bosom
of
desire
and
bow
a
back
of
patience
in
a
thankless
task
alone
beside
the
grave
of
love
i
ask
shalt
thou
or
thou
leave
go
my
hands
fain
would
i
walk
alone
the
easy
ways
of
silence
and
of
sleep
what
though
i
go
with
eyes
that
can
not
weep
and
lips
contracted
with
no
uttered
moan
through
rocks
and
thorns
where
every
footprint
bleeds
a
path
of
desert
night
that
leads
to
one
white
stone
though
sands
be
black
and
bitter
black
the
sea
night
lie
before
me
and
behind
me
night
and
god
within
far
heaven
refuse
to
light
the
consolation
of
the
dawn
for
me
between
the
shadowy
bournes
of
heaven
and
hell
it
is
enough
love
leaves
my
soul
to
dwell
with
memory
days
and
days
the
days
that
clothed
white
limbs
with
heat
and
rocked
the
red
rose
on
their
breast
have
passed
with
feet
into
the
west
these
were
the
days
that
filled
the
heart
with
overflowing
riches
of
life
in
whose
soul
no
dream
shall
start
but
hath
its
origin
in
love
now
come
the
days
in
the
haze
whose
foggy
footsteps
drip
who
pin
beneath
a
gipsy
chin
the
frosty
marigold
and
the
days
whose
forms
fall
shadowy
athwart
the
heart
whose
misty
breath
shapes
saddest
sweets
of
memory
out
of
the
bitterness
of
death
drouth
in
autumn
gnarled
against
a
west
of
copper
cavernous
with
fire
a
wind
of
frost
that
gives
no
rest
to
such
lean
leaves
as
haunt
the
brier
and
hide
the
cricket
vibrant
wire
sear
shivering
shocks
and
stubble
blurred
with
of
dull
maroon
and
creekless
hills
whereon
no
herd
finds
pasture
and
the
loon
flies
haggard
as
the
rainless
moon
all
day
the
clouds
hung
ashen
with
the
cold
and
through
the
snow
the
muffled
waters
fell
the
day
seemed
drowned
in
grief
too
deep
to
tell
like
some
old
hermit
whose
last
bead
is
told
at
eve
the
wind
woke
and
the
rolled
aside
to
leave
the
fierce
sky
visible
harsh
as
an
iron
landscape
of
wan
hell
the
dark
hills
hung
framed
in
with
gloomy
gold
and
then
towards
night
the
wind
seemed
some
one
at
my
window
wailing
now
a
little
child
crying
outside
the
door
and
now
the
long
howl
of
some
starved
beast
down
the
flue
i
sat
and
knew
was
winter
with
his
madman
song
of
miseries
whereon
he
stared
and
smiled
cold
a
mist
that
froze
beneath
the
moon
and
shook
minutest
frosty
fire
in
the
air
all
night
the
wind
was
still
as
lonely
care
who
sighs
before
her
shivering
the
face
of
winter
wore
a
crueler
look
than
when
he
shakes
the
icicles
from
his
hair
and
in
the
boisterous
pauses
lets
his
stare
freeze
through
the
forest
fettering
bough
and
brook
he
is
the
despot
now
who
sits
and
dreams
of
desolation
and
despair
and
smiles
at
poverty
who
hath
no
place
to
rest
who
wanders
life
pathless
miles
and
sees
the
window
gleams
and
hugs
her
baby
to
her
breast
in
winter
i
when
black
frosts
pluck
the
acorns
down
and
in
the
lane
the
waters
freeze
and
red
skies
the
flies
and
death
sits
grimly
the
trees
when
glitter
in
the
brown
of
dusk
like
shaggy
eyes
before
the
door
his
feet
sweetheart
and
two
white
arms
that
greet
sweetheart
and
two
white
arms
that
greet
ii
when
ways
are
drifted
with
the
leaves
and
winds
make
music
in
the
thorns
and
lone
and
lost
above
the
frost
the
new
moon
shows
its
silver
horns
when
underneath
the
eaves
the
opened
door
is
crossed
a
happy
heart
and
light
sweetheart
and
lips
to
kiss
sweetheart
and
lips
to
kiss
on
the
farm
i
he
sang
a
song
as
he
sowed
the
field
sowed
the
field
at
break
of
day
when
the
leaves
are
as
lips
that
yield
balm
and
balsam
and
spring
concealed
in
the
odorous
green
is
so
revealed
halloo
and
oh
hallo
for
the
woods
and
the
far
away
ii
he
trilled
a
song
as
he
mowed
the
mead
mowed
the
mead
as
noon
begun
when
the
hills
are
gold
with
the
ripened
seed
as
the
sunset
stairs
that
loom
and
lead
to
the
sky
where
summer
knows
naught
of
need
halloo
and
oh
hallo
for
the
hills
and
the
harvest
sun
iii
he
hummed
a
song
as
he
swung
the
flail
swung
the
flail
in
the
afternoon
when
the
idle
fields
are
a
wrecker
tale
that
the
autumn
tells
to
the
twilight
pale
as
the
year
turns
seaward
a
crimson
sail
halloo
and
oh
hallo
for
the
fields
and
the
iv
he
whistled
a
song
as
he
shouldered
his
axe
shouldered
his
axe
in
the
evening
storm
when
the
snow
of
the
road
shows
the
rabbit
tracks
and
the
wind
is
a
whip
that
the
winter
cracks
with
a
herdsman
cry
the
clouds
black
backs
halloo
and
oh
hallo
for
home
and
a
hearth
to
warm
paths
i
what
words
of
mine
can
tell
the
spell
of
garden
ways

know
so
well
the
path
that
takes
me
in
the
spring
past
quinces
where
the
sing
where
peonies
are
blossoming
unto
a
porch
around
whose
steps
blow
a
fair
girl
reaches
down
among
her
arm
more
white
than
their
sweet
snow

is
here
again
past
hollyhocks
that
shame
the
west
when
the
red
sun
has
sunk
to
rest
to
roses
bowering
a
nest
a
lattice
which
mignonette
and
deep
geraniums
surge
and
sough
where
in
the
twilight
starless
yet
a
fair
girl
eyes
are
stars
enough

days

autumn
wrap
themselves
in
haze
beneath
the
tree

butterfly
and
bee
unto
a
door
where
fiery
the
creeper
climbs
and

and

flare

the

tossed
in
clouds
beneath
great
cedars
weak
with
shaggy
snow

shrubs

kennel
whines
the
hound

us
in
faëry
come
dance
with
us
iii
with
scents
of
heat
and
sweet
the
hay
smells
by
the
bight
the
ghost
of
some
dead
pansy
bloom
the
butterfly
dreams
in
the
gloom
its
pied
wings
folded
tight
the
world
is
lost
in
fantasy
come
dance
with
us
in
faëry
come
dance
with
us
the
world
desire
the
roses
of
voluptuousness
wreathe
her
dark
locks
and
hide
her
eyes
her
limbs
are
nakedness
wherethrough
the
fragrant
blood
doth
press
the
of
paradise
she
stands
with
lilith
finger
tips
with
lilith
hands
and
gathers
up
the
wild
wine
of
all
life
and
sips
with
lips
the
soul
as
from
a
crystal
cup
what
though
she
cast
the
cup
away
the
empty
bowl
that
flashed
with
wine
her
curled
lips
kiss
that
stained
the
clay
her
fingers
touch
shall
not
these
stay
that
made
its
nothingness
divine
through
one
again
shall
live
the
glow
immortalizing
of
her
touch
and
through
the
other
sweet
to
know
how
life
swept
flame
once
the
snow
of
her
mooned
breasts
and
this
is
much
the
unattainable
mark
thou
a
shadow
crowned
with
fire
of
hell
man
holds
her
in
his
heart
as
night
doth
hold
the
moonlight
memories
of
day
dead
gold
or
as
a
asphodel
in
its
dead
loveliness
holds
scents
of
old
and
looking
on
her
lo
he
thinks
is
well
who
would
not
follow
her
whose
glory
sits
imperishably
lovely
on
the
air
who
from
the
arms
of
earth
desire
flits
with
eyes
defiant
and
rebellions
hair
hers
is
the
beauty
that
no
man
shall
share
he
who
hath
seen
what
shall
it
profit
him
he
who
doth
love
what
shall
his
passion
gain
when
disappointment
at
her
cup
bright
brim
poisons
the
pleasure
with
the
hemlock
pain
hers
is
the
passion
that
no
man
shall
drain
how
long
how
long
since
life
hath
touched
her
eyes
making
their
night
clairvoyant
and
how
long
since
love
hath
kissed
her
lips
and
made
them
wise
binding
her
brow
with
prophecy
and
song
hope
clad
her
nakedness
in
lovely
lies
giving
into
her
hands
the
right
of
wrong
lo
in
her
world
she
sets
pale
tents
of
thought
unearthly
bannered
and
her
dreams
wild
bands
besiege
the
heavens
like
a
twilight
fraught
with
recollections
of
lost
stars
she
stands
radiant
as
lilith
given
from
god
hands
the
golden
rose
of
patience
at
her
throat
drops
fragrant
petals
as
a
pensive
tune
drops
its
surrendered
sweetness
note
by
note
and
from
her
hands
the
buds
of
hope
are
strewn
mothered
of
the
barren
moon
so
in
her
flowers
man
seats
him
at
her
feet
in
worship
knowing
all
of
this
and
now
to
him
to
die
seems
very
sweet
fed
with
the
fire
of
her
look
and
kiss
while
in
his
heart
the
blood
tumultuous
beat
drowns
in
her
own
the
drowsing
serpent
hiss
he
who
hath
dreamed
but
of
her
world
shall
give
all
of
his
soul
unto
her
restlessly
he
who
hath
seen
but
her
far
face
shall
live
no
more
for
things
we
name
reality
such
is
the
power
of
her
tyranny
he
whom
she
wins
hath
nothing
the
sun
forgetting
all
that
she
may
not
forget
he
loves
her
who
still
feeds
his
soul
upon
dreams
and
desires
and
doubt
and
vain
regret
life
bitter
bread
his
heart
fierce
tears
make
wet
what
word
of
wisdom
hast
thou
life
to
wake
him
now
or
song
of
magic
now
to
dull
the
dreams
he
lives
in
or
what
charm
to
break
the
spell
that
makes
her
evil
beautiful
what
charm
to
show
her
beauty
hides
a
snake
whose
basilisk
eyes
burn
dark
behind
a
skull
remembered
here
in
the
dusk
i
see
her
face
again
as
then
i
knew
it
ere
she
fell
asleep
renunciation
glorifying
pain
of
her
soul
inmost
deep
i
shall
not
see
its
like
again
the
brow
of
passive
marble
purely
aureoled
as
some
pale
lily
in
the
afterglow
with
supernatural
gold
as
if
a
rose
should
speak
and
somehow
heard
by
some
strange
sense
the
unembodied
sound
grow
visible
her
mouth
was
as
a
word
a
sweet
thought
falters
so
do
i
still
remember
eyes
imbued
with
far
reflections
as
the
stars
suggest
the
silence
purity
and
solitude
of
infinite
peace
and
rest
she
was
my
all
i
loved
her
as
men
love
a
high
desire
religion
an
ideal
the
meaning
purpose
in
the
loss
whereof
god
shall
alone
reveal
the
sea
spirit
ah
me
i
shall
not
waken
soon
from
dreams
of
such
divinity
a
spirit
singing
in
the
moon
to
me
white
driven
of
the
storm
were
not
so
wildly
white
as
she
she
beckoned
with
a
arm
to
me
with
eyes
dark
green
and
loose
locks
that
sparkled
drippingly
out
of
the
green
wave
she
did
lean
to
me
and
sang
till
earth
and
heaven
were
a
far
forgotten
memory
for
more
than
heaven
seemed
hid
in
her
to
me
sleep
sweeter
than
love
face
or
home
love
more
than
immortality
and
music
of
the
dreamy
foam
for
me
pass
over
her
with
all
thy
ships
with
all
thy
stormy
tides
o
sea
the
memory
of
immortal
lips
for
me
a
dream
shape
with
hearts
that
held
a
gleam
i
gathered
wild
flowers
in
a
dream
and
shaped
a
woman
whose
sweet
blood
was
odor
of
the
wildwood
bud
from
dew
the
starlight
arrowed
through
i
wrought
a
woman
eyes
of
blue
the
lids
that
on
her
eyeballs
lay
were
petals
of
the
may
i
took
the
music
of
the
breeze
and
water
whispering
in
the
trees
and
shaped
the
soul
that
breathed
below
a
woman
blossom
breasts
of
snow
out
of
a
veins
i
drew
the
fragrant
crimson
beating
through
the
languid
lips
of
her
whose
kiss
was
as
a
poppy
drowsiness
out
of
the
moonlight
and
the
air
i
wrought
the
glory
of
her
hair
that
her
eyes
blue
heaven
lay
like
some
gold
cloud
dawn
of
day
a
shadow
shadow
in
the
glass
of
sleep
my
spirit
saw
her
pass
and
thinking
of
it
now
meseems
we
only
live
within
our
dreams
for
in
that
time
she
was
to
me
more
real
than
our
reality
more
real
than
earth
more
real
than
i
the
unreal
things
that
pass
and
die
the
vampire
a
lily
in
a
twilight
place
a
in
the
lonely
night
strange
beauty
of
a
woman
face
of
the
rain
that
hangs
a
star
green
ray
slim
on
a
restlessness
is
not
so
glimmering
green
and
gray
as
was
her
dress
i
drew
her
dark
hair
from
her
eyes
and
in
their
deeps
beheld
a
while
such
shadowy
moonlight
as
the
skies
of
hell
may
smile
she
held
her
mouth
up
redly
wan
and
burning
cold
i
bent
and
kissed
such
rosy
snow
as
some
wild
dawn
makes
of
a
mist
god
shall
not
take
from
me
that
hour
when
round
my
neck
her
white
arms
clung
when
my
lips
like
some
fierce
flower
her
white
throat
swung
or
words
she
murmured
while
she
leaned
she
holds
me
softly
by
the
spell
that
binds
me
to
a
fiend
until
i
die
i
there
in
the
calamus
he
stands
with
feet
and
hands
his
garb
glints
and
elfishly
and
elfishly
above
the
gleam
of
owlet
eyes
a
cap
of
downy
dyes
nods
out
at
me
nods
out
at
me
ii
now
in
the
reeds
his
face
looks
white
as
on
a
witches
night
now
through
the
dark
old
haunted
mill
so
eerily
so
eerily
he
flits
and
with
a
whippoorwill
mouth
calls
and
seems
to
syllable
come
follow
me
come
follow
me
iii
now
the
sluggish
stream
he
wends
a
slim
light
at
his
the
spotted
spawn
the
toad
hath
clomb
slips
oozily
slips
oozily
his
easy
footsteps
seem
to
come
like
of
the
scum
now
near
to
me
now
near
to
me
iv
there
by
the
stagnant
pool
he
stands
a
lamp
in
flickering
hands
the
weeds
are
slimy
to
the
tread
and
mockingly
and
mockingly
with
slanted
eyes
and
eldritch
head
he
leans
above
a
face
long
dead
the
face
of
me
the
face
of
me
the
headless
horseman
on
the
black
road
through
the
wood
as
i
rode
there
the
headless
horseman
stood
by
the
wild
pool
in
the
wood
as
i
rode
from
the
shadow
of
an
oak
as
i
rode
demon
steed
and
rider
broke
by
the
oak
as
i
rode
on
the
waste
road
through
the
plain
as
i
rode
at
my
back
he
whirled
like
rain
on
the
plain
as
i
rode
four
fierce
hoofs
shod
red
with
fire
as
i
rode
woke
the
wild
rocks
dark
and
dire
eyes
and
nostrils
streamed
with
fire
as
i
rode
on
the
deep
road
through
the
rocks
as
i
rode
i
could
reach
his
horse
locks
through
the
rocks
as
i
rode
and
again
i
looked
behind
as
i
rode
dark
as
night
and
swift
as
wind
towering
he
rode
behind
as
i
rode
on
the
steep
road
down
the
dell
as
i
rode
in
the
night
i
heard
a
bell
in
the
village
in
the
dell
as
i
rode
and
my
soul
called
out
in
prayer
as
i
rode
lo
the
demon
went
in
air
leaving
me
alone
in
prayer
as
i
rode
the
she
nay
still
amort
my
love
why
dost
thou
lag
he
the
cried
she
nay
yon
wild
stream
that
leaps
hoarse
from
the
black
pines
of
the
hakel
steeps
a
water
down
a
glittering
why
so
aghast
sweetheart
why
dost
thou
stop
he
the
passed
with
hooting
horn
she
nay
was
the
blind
wind
sweeping
through
the
thorn
around
the
ruins
of
the
dumburg
top
he
my
limbs
are
cold
she
come
warm
thee
in
mine
arms
he
mine
eyes
are
weary
she
rest
them
love
on
mine
he
i
am
athirst
she
quench
on
my
lips
thy
o
dear
belovéd
how
thy
last
kiss
warms
my
blood
again
he
off
how
thy
eyeballs
shine
thy
face
thy
form
so
do
i
die
accursed
the
troglodyte
in
ages
dead
a
troglodyte
at
the
hollow
roots
of
a
monster
height
that
grew
from
the
heart
of
the
world
to
light
i
dwelt
in
caverns
over
me
were
mountains
older
than
the
moon
and
forests
vaster
than
the
sea
and
gulfs
that
the
earthquake
hand
had
hewn
hung
under
me
and
late
and
soon
i
heard
the
dæmon
of
change
that
sighed
a
cosmic
language
of
mystery
while
life
sat
silent
with
the
infant
spirit
of
prophecy
gaunt
stars
glared
down
on
the
titan
peaks
and
the
gaunter
glare
of
the
cratered
streaks
of
the
sunset
ruin
heard
condor
shrieks
the
roar
of
cataracts
hurled
in
air
and
the
hurricane
laying
his
thunders
bare
and
rush
of
battling
beasts
whose
lair
was
the
antechamber
of
were
my
outworld
joys
but
who
shall
tell
the
awe
of
the
depths
that
heard
the
boom
of
the
iron
rivers
that
fashioned
hell
the
city
of
darkness
it
stands
in
heathen
lands
beside
a
mystic
sea
with
streets
of
many
a
god
and
templed
blasphemy
far
in
the
night
a
rose
of
light
it
shines
beside
the
sea
but
overhead
an
unknown
dread
impends
eternally
there
is
a
sound
above
around
of
music
by
the
sea
and
weird
and
wide
the
torches
glide
of
pagan
revelry
there
is
a
noise
as
of
a
voice
that
calls
beneath
the
sea
and
all
the
deep
grows
pale
with
sleep
and
vague
expectancy
then
slowly
up
as
from
a
cup
seethes
poison
lifts
the
sea
wild
mass
on
mass
as
in
black
glass
the
town
glows
fiery
it
glowers
like
hell
dark
towers
set
in
the
iron
sea
and
monster
swarms
with
awful
forms
roll
though
it
cloudily
still
overhead
the
unknown
dread
whose
shadow
dyes
the
sea
at
wait
behind
its
gate
till
god
shall
set
it
free
a
taloned
flash
an
earthquake
crash
and
lo
upon
the
sea
black
wall
on
wall
a
giant
pall
night
settles
hideously
and
where
it
burned
a
rose
inurned
red
in
the
vasty
sea
the
phantasm
of
the
dread
above
sits
in
immensity
transmutation
to
me
all
beauty
that
i
see
is
melody
made
visible
an
state
may
be
of
music
heard
in
heaven
or
hell
out
of
some
strain
of
saints
the
rose
evolved
its
bloom
and
dreaming
of
it
here
again
perhaps
it
as
perfume
out
of
some
chant
that
demons
sing
of
hate
and
pain
the
sunset
grew
and
haply
still
remembering
it
here
as
some
wild
hue
the
end
five
hundred
and
fifty
copies
of
this
book
copies
of
which
