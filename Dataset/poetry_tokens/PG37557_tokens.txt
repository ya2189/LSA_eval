a
foreword
to
even
the
casual
reader
of
poetry
who
may
chance
to
turn
to
the
following
pages
it
will
be
evident
that
the
lyrics
contained
therein
have
been
written
without
what
is
commonly
known
as
it
may
also
be
claimed
by
this
reader
that
the
lyrics
before
him
are
without
rhythm
as
such
it
may
at
first
seem
that
they
mark
an
effort
in
revolt
against
two
of
the
primary
assets
of
modern
versification
all
art
of
course
has
its
ancestry
while
it
is
the
duty
of
poetry
both
to
remember
and
to
honour
its
inherited
grandeurs
the
paradoxical
fact
remains
that
even
this
most
medium
of
emotional
expression
is
a
sort
of
warfare
between
the
embattled
soul
of
the
artist
seeking
articulation
and
the
immuring
traditions
with
which
time
and
the
prosodian
have
surrounded
him
in
painting
and
in
music
as
in
sculpture
and
the
drama
there
has
been
a
movement
of
late
to
achieve
what
may
be
called
formal
emancipation
a
struggle
to
break
away
from
the
restraints
and
the
technical
obligations
imposed
upon
the
worker
by
his
artistic
predecessors
in
one
case
this
movement
may
be
called
futurism
and
in
another
it
may
be
termed
romanticism
but
the
tendency
is
the
same
the
spirit
of
man
is
seen
in
rebellion
against
a
form
that
has
become
too
intricate
or
too
fixed
to
allow
him
freedom
of
utterance
poetry
alone
during
the
last
century
seems
to
have
remained
stable
in
the
matter
of
structure
few
new
forms
have
been
invented
and
with
one
or
two
rare
exceptions
success
has
been
achieved
through
ingeniously
elaborating
on
an
already
established
formula
and
through
meticulously
what
has
already
been
said
this
has
resulted
on
the
one
hand
in
a
technical
dexterity
which
often
enough
resembles
the
strained
postures
of
acrobatism
and
on
the
other
in
that
constantly
reiterated
complaint
as
to
the
hollowness
and
aloofness
of
modern
poetry
yet
this
poetry
is
remote
and
insincere
not
because
the
modern
spirit
is
incapable
of
feeling
but
because
what
the
singer
of
has
felt
has
not
been
directly
and
openly
expressed
his
apparel
has
remained
mediæval
he
must
still
don
mail
to
face
mausers
and
wear
against
he
must
scout
through
the
shadowy
hinterlands
of
consciousness
in
attire
that
may
be
historic
yet
at
the
same
time
is
distressingly
conspicuous
and
when
he
begins
his
assault
on
those
favouring
moments
or
inspirational
moods
which
lurk
in
the
deeper
valleys
and
of
sensibility
he
must
begin
it
as
a
marked
man
pathetically
resplendent
in
that
rigid
steel
which
is
an
anachronism
and
no
longer
an
armour
rhyme
from
the
first
has
been
imposed
upon
him
his
only
escape
from
rhyme
has
been
the
larger
utterance
of
blank
verse
yet
the
iambic
pentameter
of
his
native
tongue
perfected
in
the
sweeping
sonority
of
the
later
shakespearean
tragedies
and
left
even
more
intimidatingly
austere
in
the
roll
of
milton
has
been
found
by
the
later
singer
to
be
for
the
utterance
of
those
more
intimate
moods
and
those
subjective
experiences
which
may
be
described
as
characteristically
modern
verse
in
the
nature
of
things
has
become
less
epic
and
racial
and
more
and
more
lyric
and
personal
the
poet
consequently
has
been
forced
back
into
the
narrower
domain
so
formally
and
so
rigidly
fenced
in
by
rhyme
and
before
touching
on
the
limitations
resulting
from
this
incarceration
it
may
be
worth
while
to
venture
a
brief
glance
back
over
the
history
of
what
milton
himself
denominated
as
the
jingling
sounds
of
like
endings
and
goldsmith
characterized
as
a
vile
monotony
and
even
howells
has
spoken
of
as
the
artificial
trammels
of
verse
it
has
been
claimed
that
those
early
poets
of
palestine
who
affected
the
custom
of
beginning
a
number
of
lines
or
stanzas
with
the
same
letter
of
the
alphabet
unconsciously
prepared
the
way
for
that
ornamental
fringe
known
as
others
have
claimed
that
this
insistence
of
a
consonance
of
terminals
is
a
relique
of
the
communal
force
of
the
chant
where
the
clapping
of
hands
the
stamping
of
feet
or
the
twanging
of
marked
the
of
prehistoric
recitative
the
of
course
later
evolved
into
the
musical
instrument
and
when
poetry
became
a
written
as
well
as
a
spoken
language
the
consonantal
drone
of
rhyming
took
the
place
of
the
discarded
instrument
which
had
served
to
mark
a
secondary
and
wider
rhythm
in
the
progress
of
impassioned
recitative
it
must
be
admitted
however
even
in
the
face
of
this
ingenious
pleading
that
rhyme
is
a
much
more
modern
invention
than
it
seems
that
it
is
not
rudimentary
in
the
race
is
evidenced
by
the
fact
that
many
languages
such
as
the
celtic
the
teutonic
and
the
scandinavian
are
quite
without
it
the
greeks
even
in
their
melic
poetry
saw
no
need
for
it
the
same
may
be
said
of
the
romans
though
with
them
it
will
occasionally
be
found
that
the
of
the
pentameter
constitute
what
may
be
called
accidental
rhyme
rhyming
latin
verse
indeed
does
not
come
into
existence
until
the
end
of
the
fourth
century
and
it
is
not
until
the
time
of
the
conquest
that
becomes
in
any
way
general
in
english
song
layman
in
translating
wace
brut
found
the
original
work
written
in
rhymed
lines
and
in
following
that
early
model
produced
what
is
probably
the
first
rhymed
poem
written
in
england
with
the
introduction
of
came
the
discovery
that
a
decoration
so
formal
could
convert
verse
into
something
approaching
the
architectural
it
gave
design
to
the
lyric
with
this
new
definiteness
of
outline
of
course
came
a
newer
rigidity
of
medium
form
was
acknowledged
as
the
visible
presentation
of
this
particular
art
formal
variations
became
a
matter
of
studious
attention
efforts
were
made
to
leave
language
in
itself
instrumental
and
in
these
efforts
sound
frequently
comes
perilously
near
triumphing
over
sense
the
exotic
formal
growths
of
other
languages
were
imported
into
england
no
verbal
de
of
or
or
or
ronsardist
was
too
fantastic
for
imitation
and
adoption
the
primitive
directness
of
english
was
overrun
by
such
forms
as
the
ballade
the
chant
royal
the
rondel
the
kyrielle
the
rondeau
and
the
rondeau
redoublé
the
virelai
and
the
pantoum
the
sestina
the
villanelle
and
last
yet
by
no
means
least
the
sonnet
but
through
the
immense
tangle
of
our
intricate
lyric
growths
it
can
now
be
seen
that
mere
mechanics
do
not
always
make
poetry
while
rhyme
has
indeed
served
its
limited
purposes
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
highest
english
verse
has
been
written
without
rhyme
this
verbal
embroidery
while
it
presents
to
the
workman
in
words
a
pleasingly
decorative
form
at
the
same
time
imposes
on
him
both
an
adventitious
restraint
and
an
increased
the
twentieth
century
poet
singing
with
his
scrupulously
polished
vocalisation
usually
finds
himself
content
to
what
has
been
said
before
he
is
unable
to
travel
light
pioneering
with
so
heavy
a
burden
is
out
of
the
question
rhyme
and
meter
have
compelled
him
to
sacrifice
content
for
form
it
has
left
him
incapable
of
what
may
be
called
abandonment
and
the
consciousness
of
his
technical
impedimenta
has
limited
the
roads
along
which
he
may
adventure
his
preoccupation
with
formal
exactions
has
implanted
in
him
an
instinctive
abhorrence
for
anything
beyond
the
control
of
what
he
calls
dominated
by
this
emotional
and
intellectual
timidity
he
has
attributed
to
and
accentual
rhythm
the
of
mystic
rites
in
the
face
of
the
fact
that
the
fewer
the
obstacles
between
feeling
and
expression
the
richer
the
literary
product
must
be
and
forgetting
too
that
poetry
represents
the
extreme
vanguard
of
consciousness
both
adventuring
and
pioneering
along
the
path
of
future
progress
for
the
poet
to
turn
his
back
on
rhythm
as
at
times
he
has
been
able
to
do
with
rhyme
is
an
impossibility
for
the
rhythmising
instinct
is
innate
and
persistent
in
man
standing
for
a
law
which
permeates
every
manifestation
of
energy
the
great
heart
of
nature
itself
beats
with
a
regular
systole
and
diastole
but
rhythmically
the
modern
versifier
has
been
a
cubist
without
quite
comprehending
it
he
has
been
viewing
the
world
mathematically
he
has
been
crowding
his
soul
into
a
geometrically
designed
mould
he
has
bowed
to
a
order
of
speech
arbitrarily
imposed
on
him
by
an
ancestry
which
wrung
its
ingenuous
pleasure
out
of
an
ingenuous
regularity
of
stress
and
accent
to
succeed
under
that
law
he
must
practise
an
adroit
form
of
solemnly
pretending
to
fit
his
lines
to
a
mould
which
he
actually
and
occasionally
ignores
he
has
not
been
satisfied
with
the
rhythm
of
nature
whose
in
their
manifold
expressions
are
omnipresent
but
never
confined
to
any
single
sustained
pulse
or
any
one
limited
movement
it
is
not
argued
that
he
should
ignore
rhythm
altogether
to
do
so
as
has
already
been
said
would
be
impossible
since
life
itself
is
sustained
by
the
rise
and
fall
of
mortal
breasts
and
the
beat
and
throb
of
mortal
hearts
rhythm
is
in
man
blood
the
ear
of
the
world
instinctively
searches
for
cadences
the
poet
efforts
towards
symphonic
phrasing
have
long
since
become
habitual
and
imperative
but
that
he
should
confine
himself
to
certain
laws
of
meter
that
he
should
be
shackled
by
the
prosodian
of
the
past
is
quite
another
matter
his
predecessors
have
fashioned
many
rhythms
that
are
pretty
many
accentual
forms
that
are
cunningly
intricate
but
at
a
time
when
his
manner
of
singing
has
lost
its
vital
swing
it
is
well
for
man
to
forget
these
formal
prettinesses
and
equally
well
to
remember
that
poetry
is
not
an
intellectual
exercise
but
the
immortal
soul
of
perplexed
mortality
seeking
expression
to
abandon
fixed
rhythm
or
meter
for
the
floating
rhythm
of
the
chant
may
not
be
an
immediate
solution
of
the
problem
to
follow
the
psalms
of
david
for
example
will
not
suddenly
conjure
a
new
school
of
verse
into
the
world
but
to
return
to
the
more
open
movement
of
the
chant
which
is
man
natural
and
rudimentary
form
of
song
may
constitute
a
step
towards
freedom
the
mere
effort
towards
emancipation
in
fact
is
not
without
its
value
it
may
serve
to
impress
on
certain
minds
the
fact
that
poetry
is
capable
of
exhausting
one
particular
form
of
expression
of
incorporating
and
consuming
one
particular
embodiment
of
perishable
matter
and
passing
on
to
its
newer
fields
being
a
living
organism
it
uses
up
what
lies
before
it
and
to
find
new
vigour
must
forever
feed
on
new
forms
being
the
product
of
man
spirit
which
is
forever
subject
to
change
verse
must
not
be
worshipped
for
what
it
has
been
but
for
what
it
is
capable
of
being
no
necrophilic
regard
for
its
established
conventions
must
blind
the
lover
of
beautiful
verse
to
the
fact
that
the
primary
function
of
poetry
is
both
to
intellectualize
sensation
and
to
elucidate
emotional
experience
if
man
must
worship
beauty
only
as
he
has
known
it
in
the
past
man
must
be
satisfied
with
worshipping
that
which
has
lived
and
now
is
dead

and

and

of

who

watching

of

i

to
go
home
oh
day
after

i
get
thinking
of
home
where
the
black
firs
fringe
the
skyline
and
the
birds
wheel
down
the
silence
and
the
hemlocks
whisper
peace
and
the
cool

and

is
crowned
with
glory
and

lone
horizon
softens
and
the
world
at
home
with

oh
i
want
to
go
there

to
go
home
life
a
rind
of
light
hangs
low
on
the
rim
of
the
world
a
sound
of
feet
disturbs
the
quiet
of
the
cell
where
a
rope
and
a
beam
looms
high
at
the
end
of
the
yard
but
in
the
dusk
of
that
walled
yard
waits
a
woman
and
as
the
thing
from
its
cell
still
guarded
and
chained
and
bound
crosses
that
little
space
silent
for
ten
brief
steps
a
woman
hangs
on
his
neck
that
walk
from
a
cell
to
a
sleep
is
known
as
life
and
those
ten
dark
steps
of
tangled
rapture
and
tears
men
still
call
some
day
o
seeker
of
dreams
some
day
o
seeker
of
dreams
they
will
seek
even
us
some
day
they
will
wake
fellow
singer
and
hunger
and
want
for
the
ways
to
the
lonelier
height
so
let
us
shy
weaver
of
beauty
take
heart
for
out
of
their
dust
they
will
call
to
us
yet
let
us
wait
and
sing
and
be
wise
as
the
sea
has
waited
and
sung
as
the
hills
through
the
night
have
been
wise
for
we
are
the
bringers
of
light
and
the
voices
of
love
aye
we
are
the
soothers
of
pain
the
appeasers
of
death
the
dusk
and
the
star
and
the
gleam
and
the
loneliest
peak
and
when
they
have
found
and
seen
and
know
not
whither
they
trend
they
will
come
to
us
crying
aloud
like
a
child
in
the
night
and
when
they
have
learned
of
our
lips
still
back
to
our
feet
they
will
grope
for
that
ultimate
essence
and
core
of
all
song
to
usher
them
empty
and
naked
then
out
to
the
unanswering
stars
where
silence
and
dreaming
and
music
are
one
black
hours
i
have
drunk
deep
of
the
well
of
bitterness
black
hours
have
harried
me
blind
fate
has
bludgeoned
my
bent
head
and
on
my
brow
the
iron
crown
of
sorrow
has
been
crushed
and
being
mortal
i
have
cried
aloud
at
anguish
ineluctable
but
over
each
black
hour
has
hung
forlorn
this
star
of
knowledge
the
path
of
pain
too
great
to
be
endured
leads
always
unto
peace
and
when
the
granite
road
of
anguish
mounts
up
and
still
up
to
its
one
ultimate
and
dizzy
height
of
torture
softly
it
dips
and
meets
the
valley
of
endless
rest
before
renewal
summer
is
dead
and
love
is
gone
and
life
is
glad
of
this
for
sad
were
both
with
having
given
much
and
bowed
were
both
with
great
desires
fulfilled
and
both
were
grown
too
sadly
wise
ever
to
live
again
too
aged
with
hours
too
deeply
sung
by
throats
that
took
no
thought
of
weariness
moving
too
madly
toward
the
crest
of
things
giving
too
freely
of
the
fountaining
sap
crowding
too
gladly
into
grass
and
leaves
breathing
too
blindly
into
flower
and
song
again
the
lyric
hope
may
thrill
the
world
again
the
sap
may
sweeten
into
leaves
again
will
april
come
with
all
her
choiring
throats
but
not
for
the
course
is
run
and
the
cruse
is
full
and
the
loin
ungirt
and
the
hour
ordained
and
now
there
is
need
of
rest
and
need
of
renewal
there
is
and
need
of
silence
and
need
of
sleep
too
clear
the
light
now
lies
on
hill
and
valley
and
little
is
left
to
say
and
nothing
is
left
to
give
summer
is
dead
and
love
is
gone
hours
i
am
through
with
regret
no
more
shall
i
kennel
with
pain
i
have
called
to
this
whimpering
soul
this
soul
that
is
sodden
with
tears
and
sour
with
the
reek
of
the
years
and
now
we
shall
glory
in
light
like
a
tatter
of
sail
in
the
wind
like
a
tangle
of
net
on
the
sand
like
a
hound
stretched
out
in
the
heat
my
soul
shall
lie
in
the
sun
and
be
drowsy
with
peace
and
not
think
of
the
past
letters
from
home
letters
from
home
you
said
unopened
they
lay
on
the
as
you
stared
with
me
at
the
prairie
and
the
foothills
bathed
with
light
letters
from
home
you
whispered
and
the
homeland
casements
shone
through
the
homeland
dusk
again
and
the
sound
of
the
birds
came
back
and
the
soft
green
sorrowing
hills
and
the
sigh
of
remembered
names
the
wine
of
remembered
youth
oh
these
came
back
back
with
those
idle
words
of
letters
from
home
over
such
desolate
leagues
over
such
sundering
seas
out
of
the
lost
dead
years
after
the
days
of
waiting
after
the
ache
had
died
after
the
brine
of
failure
after
the
outland
peace
of
the
trail
that
never
turns
back
now
that
the
whispers
how
home
shall
never
again
be
home
and
now
that
the
arms
of
the
have
drawn
us
close
to
its
breast
out
of
the
dead
that
is
proved
not
dead
to
waken
the
sorrow
that
should
have
died
to
tighten
the
throat
that
never
shall
sing
to
sadden
the
trails
that
we
still
must
ride
too
late
they
come
to
us
here
our
letters
from
home
chains
i
watched
the
men
at
work
on
the
stubborn
rock
but
mostly
the
one
man
poised
on
a
drill
above
the
steam
that
hissed
and
billowed
about
him
white
in
the
frosty
air
where
the
lordly
house
would
stand
majestic
muscular
high
like
a
god
he
stood
and
controlled
and
stopped
and
started
his
thundering
drill
offhand
and
careless
and
lordly
as
thor
begrimed
and
solemn
and
crowned
with
sweat
where
the
great
steel
chains
swung
over
the
buckets
of
rock
then
out
of
a
nearby
house
came
a
youth
all
gloved
and
encased
in
fur
and
touched
with
content
and
frail
and
finished
leading
a
out
on
a
silver
chain
he
peered
at
the
figure
that
fought
with
the
drill
above
the
billowing
steam
and
tumult
of
sound
peered
up
for
a
moment
impassive
with
almost
pitying
eyes
and
then
went
pensively
down
the
avenue
calm
in
the
clear
white
light
of
the
noonday
sun
not
holding
but
held
by
his
silvery
chain
the
drums
a
village
wrapped
in
slumber
silent
between
the
hills
empty
of
marketplace
empty
of
moving
life
such
is
my
quiet
heart
it
rests
sleeping
its
heavy
sleep
but
sudden
across
the
dark
tingles
a
sound
of
drums
the
drums
the
drums
the
distant
drums
the
throb
of
the
drums
strikes
up
the
beat
of
the
drums
awakes
then
loud
through
the
little
streets
and
strange
to
the
startled
roofs
the
drums
the
drums
approach
and
pound
and
throb
and
clamour
and
thrill
and
pass
and
between
the
echoing
all
swart
and
grim
they
go
the
battalions
of
regret
after
the
drums
the
valiant
drums
that
die
away
in
the
night
anæsthesia
i
caught
the
smell
of
ether
from
the
room
where
the
hospital
stood
suddenly
all
about
me
i
felt
a
mist
of
anguish
and
the
old
old
hour
of
dread
when
death
had
shambled
by
yellow
with
time
it
is
this
letter
on
which
i
look
but
up
from
it
comes
a
perfume
that
stabs
me
still
to
the
heart
and
suddenly
at
the
odour
through
a
mist
i
know
rapture
and
love
and
wild
regret
when
life
and
you
went
by
a
summer
night
mournful
the
summer
moon
rose
from
the
quiet
sea
golden
and
sad
and
full
of
regret
as
though
it
would
ask
of
earth
where
all
her
lovers
had
vanished
and
whither
had
gone
the
lips
that
had
sighed
to
her
light
of
old
then
i
caught
a
pulse
of
music
brokenly
out
at
the
and
i
heard
the
voices
of
girls
going
home
in
the
dark
laughing
along
the
over
a
lover
word
sappho
tomb
i
in
an
old
and
ashen
island
beside
a
city
grey
with
death
they
are
seeking
sappho
tomb
ii
beneath
a
vineyard
ruinous
and
a
temple
they
are
delving
where
she
sleeps
there
between
a
lonely
valley
filled
with
noonday
silences
and
the
headlands
of
soft
violet
where
the
sapphire
seas
still
whisper
whisper
with
her
sigh
through
a
country
sad
with
wonder
men
are
seeking
vanished
sappho
men
are
searching
for
the
tomb
of
muted
song
iii
they
will
find
a
something
there
in
a
cavern
where
no
sound
is
in
a
room
of
milky
marble
walled
with
black
amphibolite
with
faded
words
and
stained
with
time
iv
sleeping
in
a
chamber
with
her
phials
of
perfume
round
her
in
a
coffin
with
her
image
on
the
cover
childish
echo
of
her
beauty
etched
in
black
and
gold
barbaric
lift
it
slowly
slowly
seekers
or
your
search
will
end
in
dust
v
with
a
tiny
nude
astarte
bright
with
gilt
and
gravely
watching
over
malachite
over
rubies
pale
and
topaz
and
the
crumbled
dust
of
pearls
vi
with
her
tarnished
silver
mirror
with
her
rings
of
beaten
gold
with
her
robes
of
faded
purple
and
the
stylus
that
so
often
traced
the
azure
on
her
eyelids
eyelids
delicate
and
weary
drooping
and
at
her
head
will
be
a
plectron
made
of
ivory
worn
with
time
and
a
flute
and
gilded
lyre
will
be
found
beside
her
feet
and
two
little
yellow
sandals
and
crude
serpents
chased
in
silver
on
her
ankle
rings
and
a
cloud
of
drifting
dust
all
her
shining
hair
vii
in
that
lost
and
lonely
tomb
they
may
find
her
find
the
arms
that
ached
with
rapture
softly
folded
on
a
breast
that
for
evermore
is
silent
find
the
eyes
no
longer
wistful
find
the
lips
no
longer
singing
and
the
heart
so
hot
and
wayward
when
that
ashen
land
was
young
cold
through
all
the
mists
of
time
cold
beneath
the
lesbian
marble
in
the
room
that
drips
with
tears
the
wild
swans
pass
in
the
dead
of
the
night
you
turned
in
your
troubled
sleep
as
you
heard
the
wild
swans
pass
and
then
you
slept
again
you
slept
while
a
new
world
swam
beneath
that
army
of
eager
wings
while
plainland
and
slough
and
lake
lay
wide
to
those
outstretched
throats
while
the
far
lone
lights
allured
that
phalanx
of
passionate
breasts
and
i
who
had
loved
you
more
than
a
homing
bird
loves
flight
i
watched
with
an
ache
for
freedom
i
rose
with
a
need
for
life
knowing
that
love
had
passed
into
its
unknown
north
at
notre
dame
i
o
odour
of
incense
pride
of
purple
and
gold
burst
of
music
and
praise
and
passion
of
flute
and
pipe
o
voices
of
silver
and
soothing
antiphonal
chant
o
harmony
ancient
ecstatic
to
the
echoing
roof
with
tremulous
roll
of
awakened
reverberant
tubes
and
thunder
of
sound
and
illusion
of
mystical
song
and
outclangour
of
jubilant
bell
and
glimmer
of
gold
and
taper
and
throbbing
insistent
pipe
if
song
and
emotion
and
music
were
all
were
it
only
all
ii
for
see
dark
heart
of
mine
how
the
singers
have
ceased
and
gone
see
how
all
of
the
music
is
lost
and
the
lights
are
low
and
how
as
our
idle
arms
these
twin
ineloquent
towers
grope
up
through
the
old
inaccessible
night
to
his
stars
how
in
vain
we
have
stormed
on
the
bastions
of
silence
with
sound
how
in
vain
with
our
music
and
song
and
emotion
assailed
the
unknown
how
beat
with
the
wings
of
our
worship
on
earth
imprisoning
bars
for
the
pinions
of
music
have
wearied
the
proud
loud
tubes
have
tired
yet
still
grim
and
taciturn
stand
his
immutable
stars
and
lost
in
the
gloom
to
his
frontiers
old
i
turn
where
glimmer
those
sentinel
fires
beyond
which
dark
heart
we
two
some
night
must
steal
us
forth
quite
naked
and
alone
the
pilot
i
lounge
on
the
deck
of
the
homeward
bound
with
its
load
churning
from
headland
to
headland
through
moonlight
and
silence
and
dusk
and
the
decks
are
alive
with
laughter
and
music
and
singing
and
i
see
the
forms
of
the
sleepers
and
the
shadowy
lovers
that
lean
so
close
to
the
rail
and
the
romping
children
behind
and
the
dancers
amidships
but
high
above
us
there
in
the
gloom
where
the
merriment
breaks
like
a
wave
at
his
feet
unseen
of
lover
and
dancer
and
me
is
the
pilot
impassive
and
stern
with
his
grim
eyes
watching
the
course
doors
listen
footsteps
are
they
that
falter
through
the
gloom
that
echo
through
the
lonely
chambers
of
our
house
of
life
listen
did
a
door
close
did
a
whisper
waken
did
a
ghostly
something
sigh
across
the
dusk
from
the
mournful
silence
something
something
went
far
down
some
shadowy
passage
faintly
closed
a
door
and
o
how
empty
lies
our
house
of
life
spring
floods
you
stood
alone
in
the
dusky
window
watching
the
racing
river
touched
with
a
vague
unrest
and
if
tired
of
loving
too
much
more
troubled
at
heart
to
find
that
the
flame
of
love
could
wither
and
the
wonder
of
love
could
pass
you
kneeled
at
the
and
stared
through
the
maples
where
an
april
robin
fluted
stared
idly
out
at
the
sweep
of
the
river
silver
and
paling
gold
in
the
ghostly
april
twilight
shadowy
there
in
the
dusk
you
watched
with
shadowy
eyes
the
racing
sad
unreasoning
hurrying
torrent
of
silver
seeking
its
sea
faintly
i
heard
you
sigh
and
faintly
i
heard
the
robin
flute
and
faintly
from
rooms
remote
came
a
broken
murmur
of
voices
and
life
for
a
breath
stood
bathed
in
a
wonder
crowned
with
pain
and
immortal
the
moment
hung
and
i
know
that
the
thought
of
you
there
at
the
shadowy
window
and
the
matted
black
of
the
maples
and
the
sunset
call
of
a
bird
and
the
sad
wide
reaches
of
silver
will
house
in
my
haunted
heart
till
the
end
of
time
the
turn
of
the
year
the
pines
shake
and
the
winds
wake
and
the
dark
waves
crowd
the
the
birds
wheel
out
on
a
troubled
sky
the
widening
road
runs
white
and
long
and
the
page
is
turned
and
the
world
is
tired
so
i
want
no
more
of
twilight
sloth
and
i
want
no
more
of
resting
and
of
all
the
earth
i
ask
no
more
than
the
green
sea
the
great
sea
the
long
road
the
white
road
and
a
change
of
life
if
i
love
you
if
i
love
you
woman
of
rose
and
warmth
and
wondering
eyes
if
it
so
fall
out
that
you
are
the
woman
i
choose
oh
what
is
there
left
to
say
and
what
should
it
matter
to
me
or
what
can
it
mean
to
you
for
under
the
two
white
breasts
and
the
womb
that
makes
you
woman
the
call
of
the
ages
whispers
and
the
countless
ghosts
awaken
and
stronger
than
sighs
and
weeping
the
urge
that
makes
us
one
and
older
than
hate
or
loving
or
shame
this
want
that
builds
the
world
what
shall
i
care
what
shall
i
care
for
the
ways
of
these
idle
and
women
in
silk
and
the
lisping
that
trail
at
their
heels
what
are
they
worth
in
my
world
or
the
world
that
i
want
these
indolent
delicate
women
and
these
daring
to
call
themselves
men
yet
afraid
to
get
down
to
the
earth
and
afraid
of
the
wind
afraid
of
the
truth
and
so
sadly
afraid
of
themselves
how
can
they
help
me
in
trouble
and
death
how
can
they
keep
me
from
hating
my
kind
oh
i
want
to
get
out
of
their
coffining
rooms
i
want
to
walk
free
with
a
man
a
man
who
has
lived
and
dared
and
swung
through
the
cycle
of
life
god
give
me
a
man
for
a
friend
to
the
end
give
me
a
man
with
his
heel
on
the
neck
of
hate
with
his
fist
in
the
face
of
death
a
man
not
fretted
with
womanish
things
unafraid
of
the
light
of
the
worm
in
the
lip
of
a
corpse
unafraid
of
the
call
from
the
cell
of
his
heart
god
give
me
a
man
for
friend
hunter
and
hunted
i
when
the
sun
is
high
and
the
hills
are
happy
with
light
then
virile
and
strong
i
am
then
ruddy
with
life
i
fare
the
fighter
who
feels
no
dread
the
roamer
who
knows
no
bounds
the
hunter
who
makes
the
world
his
prey
and
shouting
and
swept
with
pride
still
mounts
to
the
lonelier
height
ii
in
the
cool
of
the
day
when
the
huddling
shadows
swarm
and
the
ominous
eyes
look
out
and
night
slinks
over
the
swales
and
the
silence
is
chill
with
death
then
i
am
the
croucher
beside
the
coals
the
lurker
within
the
shadowy
cave
who
listens
and
mutters
a
charm
and
trembles
and
waits
a
hunted
thing
grown
afraid
of
the
hunt
a
silence
enisled
in
silence
a
wonder
enwrapped
in
awe
apple
blossoms
i
saw
a
woman
stand
under
the
seas
of
bloom
under
the
waves
of
colour
and
light
the
showery
snow
and
rose
of
the
odorous
trees
that
made
a
glory
of
earth
she
stood
where
the
petals
fell
and
her
hands
were
on
her
breast
and
her
lips
were
touched
with
wonder
and
her
eyes
were
full
of
pain
for
pure
she
was
and
young
and
it
was
spring
the
house
of
life
quietly
i
closed
the
door
then
i
said
to
my
soul
i
shall
never
come
back
back
to
this
haunted
room
where
sorrow
and
i
have
slept
i
turned
from
that
hated
door
and
passed
through
the
house
of
life
through
its
ghostly
rooms
and
glad
and
its
corridors
dim
with
age
then
lightly
i
crossed
a
threshold
where
the
casements
showed
the
sun
and
i
entered
an
unknown
room
and
my
heart
went
cold
for
about
me
stood
that
chamber
of
pain
i
had
thought
to
see
no
more
ultimata
i
am
desolate
desolate
because
of
a
woman
when
at
midnight
walking
alone
i
look
up
at
the
stars
i
see
only
the
eyes
of
this
woman
in
valleys
and
secluded
where
once
i
sought
peace
i
find
now
only
unrest
and
this
one
unaltering
want
when
the
stirs
in
the
i
hear
only
her
voice
whisper
when
by
day
i
gaze
into
the
azure
above
me
i
see
only
the
face
of
this
woman
in
the
sunlight
i
can
not
find
comfort
nor
can
i
find
peace
in
the
shadows
neither
can
i
take
joy
in
the
nor
find
solace
on
kindlier
breasts
for
deep
in
the
eyes
of
all
women
i
watch
i
see
only
her
eyes
stare
back
nor
can
i
shut
the
thought
of
her
out
of
my
heart
and
the
ache
for
her
out
of
my
hours
ruthlessly
now
she
invades
even
my
dreams
and
wounds
me
in
sleep
and
my
body
cries
out
for
her
early
and
late
and
forever
cries
out
for
her
and
her
alone
i
want
this
woman
i
am
sick
at
heart
because
of
this
woman
i
am
lost
to
shame
because
of
my
want
and
mine
own
people
have
come
to
mean
naught
to
me
and
with
many
about
me
still
am
i
utterly
alone
and
quite
solitary
now
i
take
my
way
where
men
are
intent
on
puny
things
and
phantasmal
legions
pace
and
a
wearisome
thing
is
life
and
forever
the
shadow
of
this
one
woman
is
falling
across
my
path
the
turn
in
the
road
is
a
promise
of
her
the
twilight
is
thronged
with
her
ghosts
the
grasses
speak
only
of
her
the
leaves
whisper
her
name
forever
the
odorous
fields
are
full
of
her
her
lips
i
keep
telling
myself
are
a
cup
from
which
i
must
drink
her
breast
is
the
one
last
pillow
whereon
i
may
ever
find
peace
yet
she
has
not
come
to
me
and
being
denied
her
everything
stands
denied
and
all
men
who
have
waited
in
vain
for
love
cry
out
through
my
desolate
heart
and
the
want
of
the
hungering
world
runs
like
fire
through
my
veins
and
bursts
from
my
throat
in
the
cry
i
want
this
woman
i
am
possessed
of
a
great
sickness
and
likewise
possessed
of
a
great
strength
and
the
ultimate
hour
has
come
i
will
arise
and
go
unto
this
woman
and
with
bent
head
and
my
arms
about
her
knees
i
shall
say
unto
her
beloved
beyond
all
words
others
have
sought
your
side
and
many
have
craved
your
kiss
but
none
o
body
of
flesh
and
bone
has
known
a
hunger
like
mine
and
though
evil
befall
or
good
this
hunger
is
given
to
me
and
is
now
made
known
to
you
for
i
must
die
or
you
must
die
or
desire
must
die
this
night
the
life
on
the
table
in
the
room
where
the
white
bed
waits
stand
banks
of
meaningless
flowers
in
the
street
are
a
row
of
cabs
and
along
the
phantasmal
feet
repass
through
the
warm
still
air
the
odour
of
ether
hangs
and
on
this
slenderest
thread
of
one
thin
pulse
hangs
and
swings
the
hope
of
life
the
life
of
her
i
love
you
bid
me
to
sleep
you
bid
me
to
sleep
but
why
o
daughter
of
beauty
was
beauty
thus
born
in
the
world
since
out
of
these
shadowy
eyes
the
wonder
shall
pass
and
out
of
this
surging
and
passionate
breast
the
dream
shall
depart
and
out
of
these
delicate
rivers
of
warmth
the
fire
shall
wither
and
fail
and
youth
like
a
bird
from
your
body
shall
fly
and
time
like
a
fang
on
your
flesh
shall
feed
and
this
perilous
bosom
that
pulses
with
love
shall
go
down
to
the
dust
from
which
it
arose
yet
daughter
of
beauty
close
close
to
its
sumptuous
warmth
you
hold
my
sorrowing
head
and
smile
with
shadowy
eyes
and
bid
me
to
sleep
again
the
last
of
summer
the
opal
afternoon
is
cool
and
very
still
a
wash
of
tawny
air
that
melts
to
gold
bathes
all
the
skyline
hill
by
hill
out
of
the
pinelands
a
black
crow
calls
and
the
year
seems
old
a
woman
from
a
doorway
sings
and
from
the
a
barks
and
through
the
umber
woods
the
echo
falls
then
silence
on
the
still
world
lies
and
faint
and
far
the
birds
fly
south
and
behind
the
dark
pines
drops
the
sun
and
a
small
wind
wakes
and
sighs
and
summer
see
is
done
at
alone
amid
the
rockies
i
have
stood
alone
across
the
prairie
midnight
calm
full
often
i
have
fared
and
faced
the
hushed
infinity
of
night
alone
i
have
hung
poised
between
a
quietly
heaving
sea
and
quieter
sky
aching
with
isolation
absolute
and
in
death
valley
i
have
walked
alone
and
sought
in
vain
for
some
appeasing
sign
of
life
or
movement
while
my
heart
called
out
for
some
befriending
face
or
some
assuaging
voice
but
never
on
my
soul
has
weighed
such
loneliness
as
this
as
here
amid
the
seething
london
tides
i
look
upon
these
ghosts
that
come
and
go
these
swarming
restless
souls
innumerable
who
through
their
dirge
of
unconcern
must
know
and
nurse
the
thought
of
kindred
ghosts
as
lonely
as
themselves
or
else
go
mad
with
it
prescience
i
the
sting
of
it
all
you
said
as
you
stooped
low
over
your
roses
the
worst
of
it
is
when
i
think
of
death
that
spring
by
spring
the
earth
shall
still
be
beautiful
and
summer
by
summer
be
lovely
again
and
i
shall
be
gone
ii
i
would
not
care
perhaps
you
said
watching
your
roses
if
only
dust
and
ruin
and
emptiness
left
behind
but
the
thought
that
earth
and
april
year
by
casual
year
shall
waken
around
the
old
ways
soft
and
beautiful
year
by
year
when
i
am
away
this
this
breaks
my
heart
the
steel
workers
i
watched
the
workers
in
steel
the
glow
of
the
furnace
the
rivers
of
molten
metal
the
tremulous
rumble
of
cranes
the
throb
of
the
hammers
on
sullen
and
resonant
anvils
i
saw
the
workers
twisting
earth
iron
to
their
use
shaping
the
steel
to
their
thoughts
and
in
some
way
out
of
the
fury
and
the
fires
of
mortal
passion
it
seemed
to
me
in
some
way
out
of
the
torture
and
tumult
of
inchoate
time
the
hammer
of
sin
is
shaping
the
soul
of
man
the
children
the
city
is
old
in
sin
and
children
are
not
for
cities
and
woman
you
want
them
not
you
say
with
a
broken
laugh
yet
out
of
each
wayward
softness
of
voice
and
each
fulness
of
breast
and
each
echo
of
song
each
flutter
of
lace
and
quest
of
beautiful
things
each
coil
of
entangling
hair
built
into
its
crown
each
whisper
and
touch
in
the
silence
of
night
each
red
unreasoning
mouth
that
is
lifted
to
mouth
each
whiteness
of
brow
that
is
furrowed
no
more
with
thought
each
careless
soft
curve
of
lips
that
can
never
explain
arises
the
old
and
the
inappeasable
cry
every
girl
who
leans
from
a
tenement
sill
and
flutters
a
hand
to
a
youth
every
woman
who
waits
for
a
man
in
the
dusk
every
harlotous
arm
flung
up
to
a
drunken
heel
that
would
trample
truth
down
in
the
dust
reaches
unknowingly
out
for
its
own
and
blind
to
its
heritage
waits
for
its
child
the
nocturne
remote
in
some
dim
room
on
this
dark
april
morning
soft
with
rain
i
hear
her
pensive
touch
fall
aimless
on
the
keys
and
stop
and
play
again
and
as
the
music
wakens
and
the
shadowy
house
is
still
how
all
my
troubled
soul
cries
out
for
things
i
know
not
of
ah
keen
the
quick
chords
fall
and
weighted
with
regret
fade
through
the
quiet
rooms
and
warm
as
april
rain
the
strange
tears
fall
and
life
in
some
way
seems
too
deep
to
bear
the
wild
geese
over
my
head
high
in
the
paling
light
and
touched
with
the
sunset
glow
soaring
and
strong
and
free
the
unswerving
phalanx
sweeps
the
honking
wild
geese
go
go
with
a
flurry
of
wings
home
to
their
norland
lakes
and
the
tarns
of
peace
and
the
pinelands
soft
with
spring
i
can
not
go
as
the
geese
go
but
into
the
steadfast
north
the
north
that
is
dark
and
tender
my
spirit
wings
wings
with
a
flurry
of
longing
thoughts
and
nests
in
the
tarns
of
youth
the
day
i
dewy
dewy
is
this
the
day
she
comes
o
face
of
morning
must
you
never
wake
silvery
silvery
does
she
come
o
murmurous
murmurous
beneath
your
whispering
shadow
she
will
surely
pass
and
thrush
beneath
the
and
in
the
sing
as
you
have
never
sung
for
she
will
surely
come
ii
the
lone
green
of
the
the
grey
light
on
the
the
mournful
stir
of
the
thin
note
of
the
brown
thrush
and
the
call
of
troubled
across
the
afternoon
ah
summer
now
is
over
and
for
us
the
season
closed
for
she
who
came
an
hour
ago
has
gone
again
has
gone
the
revolt
god
knows
that
i
tinkled
and
jingled
and
strummed
that
i
piped
it
and
jigged
it
until
i
fair
sick
of
the
game
that
i
given
them
slag
and
wasted
the
silver
of
song
that
i
thrown
them
the
tailings
and
they
taken
them
up
content
but
now
i
want
to
slough
off
the
bitterness
born
of
it
all
i
want
to
throw
off
the
shackles
and
chains
of
time
i
want
to
sit
down
with
my
soul
and
talk
straight
out
i
want
to
make
peace
with
myself
and
say
what
i
have
to
say
while
still
there
is
time
yea
i
will
arise
and
go
forth
i
have
said
to
the
uplands
of
truth
to
be
free
as
the
wind
rough
and
unruly
and
open
and
yea
i
will
go
forth
and
fling
from
my
soul
the
shackles
and
chains
of
song
but
lo
on
my
wrists
are
the
scars
and
here
on
my
ankles
the
and
the
see
on
my
face
and
my
throat
seems
thick
with
the
and
for
guidance
i
grope
to
the
walls
and
after
my
moment
of
light
i
want
to
go
back
to
the
dark
since
the
open
still
makes
me
afraid
and
silence
seems
best
in
the
sun
and
song
in
the
dusk
atavism
i
feel
all
primal
and
savage
i
could
eat
and
drink
deep
and
love
strong
i
could
fight
and
exult
and
boast
and
be
glad
i
could
tear
out
the
life
of
a
wild
thing
and
laugh
at
it
i
could
crush
into
panting
submission
the
breast
of
a
woman
from
her
tribe
and
her
i
could
glory
in
folly
and
fire
and
ruin
and
race
with
the
wind
and
slink
on
the
heels
of
my
foes
and
dabble
their
blood
on
my
brows
for
i
am
sick
of
it
all
this
silent
and
orderly
empty
life
and
i
feel
all
savage
again
march
twilight
black
with
a
batter
of
mud
stippled
with
silvery
pools
stands
the
pavement
at
the
and
the
gutter
snow
is
gone
from
cobble
and
runnelling
curb
and
no
longer
the
ramping
wind
is
rattling
the
rusty
signs
and
moted
and
soft
and
misty
hangs
the
sunlight
over
the
and
the
crowds
of
the
city
walk
in
a
flood
of
gold
and
suddenly
out
of
the
dusk
there
comes
the
ancient
question
can
it
be
that
i
have
lived
in
earlier
worlds
unknown
or
is
it
that
somewhere
deep
in
this
husk
that
men
call
me
are
kennelled
a
motley
kin
i
never
shall
know
or
name
are
housed
still
querulous
ghosts
that
sigh
and
awaken
and
move
and
sleep
once
more
the
echo
i
i
am
only
a
note
in
the
chorus
a
leaf
in
the
fluttering
june
a
wave
on
the
deep
these
things
that
i
struggle
to
utter
have
all
been
uttered
before
in
many
another
heart
the
selfsame
song
was
born
the
ancient
ache
endured
the
timeless
wonder
faced
the
unanswered
question
nursed
the
resurgent
hunger
felt
and
the
eternal
failure
known
ii
but
glad
is
the
lip
of
its
whisper
the
wave
of
its
life
the
leaf
of
its
lisp
and
glad
for
its
hour
is
my
soul
for
its
echo
of
godlier
music
its
fragment
of
song
autumn
the
thin
gold
of
the
sun
lies
slanting
on
the
hill
in
the
sorrowful
greys
and
muffled
violets
of
the
old
orchard
a
group
of
girls
are
quietly
gathering
apples
through
the
mingled
gloom
and
green
they
scarcely
speak
at
all
and
their
broken
voices
rise
and
fall
unutterably
sad
there
are
no
birds
and
the
goldenrod
is
gone
and
a
child
calls
out
far
away
across
the
autumn
twilight
and
the
sad
grey
of
the
dusk
grows
slowly
deeper
and
all
the
world
seems
old
faces
i
tire
of
these
empty
masks
these
faces
of
city
women
that
seem
so
vapid
and
i
get
tired
of
their
guarded
ways
and
their
eyes
that
are
always
empty
of
either
passion
or
hate
or
promise
or
love
and
that
seem
to
be
old
and
are
never
young
i
think
of
the
homelier
faces
that
i
have
seen
the
vital
and
open
faces
in
the
of
the
world
a
polish
girl
who
met
her
lover
one
wintry
morning
outside
the
gaol
at
ossining
a
lean
young
slav
violinist
and
the
steerage
women
about
him
held
by
the
sound
of
his
music
a
young
and
teuton
suckling
her
child
on
a
grey
stone
bridge
in
detmold
a
group
of
girls
from
ireland
crowding
the
steps
of
a
and
singing
together
as
their
train
rocked
on
and
on
over
the
prairie
a
mournful
calabrian
mother
standing
and
staring
out
past
the
mists
of
ischia
after
a
fading
steamer
a
nautch
girl
held
by
a
sailor
who
taken
a
knife
from
her
fingers
but
not
the
fire
from
her
eyes
and
a
silent
sicilian
mother
standing
alone
in
the
marina
awaiting
her
boy
who
had
been
long
years
away
these
i
remember
and
of
these
i
never
tire
there
is
strength
in
the
soil
there
is
strength
in
the
soil
in
the
earth
there
is
laughter
and
youth
there
is
solace
and
hope
in
the
upturned
loam
and
lo
i
shall
plant
my
soul
in
it
here
like
a
seed
and
forth
it
shall
come
to
me
as
a
flower
of
song
for
i
know
it
is
good
to
get
back
to
the
earth
that
is
orderly
placid
it
is
good
to
know
how
quiet
and
noncommittal
it
breathes
this
ample
and
opulent
bosom
that
must
some
day
nurse
us
all
on
opal
aprilian
mornings
like
this
i
seem
dizzy
and
drunk
with
life
i
waken
and
wander
and
laugh
in
the
sun
with
some
mystical
knowledge
enormous
i
lift
up
my
face
to
the
light
drunk
with
a
gladness
stupendous
i
seem
with
some
wine
of
immensity
i
reel
and
my
arm
could
fling
time
from
his
throne
i
could
pelt
the
awed
taciturn
arch
of
morning
with
music
and
mirth
and
i
feel
should
i
find
but
a
voice
for
my
thought
that
the
infinite
orbits
of
all
god
loneliest
stars
that
are
weaving
vast
traceries
out
on
the
fringes
of
night
could
never
stand
more
than
a
hem
on
the
robe
of
my
song
my
heart
stood
empty
my
heart
stood
empty
and
bare
so
i
hung
it
with
thoughts
of
a
woman
the
remembered
ways
of
this
woman
hung
sweet
in
my
heart
so
i
followed
where
thought
should
lead
and
it
led
to
her
feet
but
the
mouth
of
this
woman
was
pain
and
the
love
of
this
woman
regret
and
now
only
the
thought
of
all
those
remembered
thoughts
of
remembered
ways
is
shut
in
my
heart
one
night
in
the
northwest
when
they
flagged
our
train
because
of
a
broken
rail
i
stepped
down
out
of
the
crowded
car
with
its
clamour
and
dust
and
heat
and
babel
of
broken
talk
i
stepped
out
into
the
cool
the
velvet
cool
of
the
night
and
felt
the
balm
of
the
on
my
face
and
somewhere
i
heard
the
running
of
water
i
felt
the
breathing
of
grass
and
i
knew
as
i
saw
the
great
white
stars
that
the
world
was
made
for
good
dreamers
there
a
poet
tombed
in
you
man
of
blood
and
iron
there
a
dreamer
dead
and
buried
deep
beneath
your
cynic
frown
deep
beneath
your
toil
and
deep
beneath
my
music
there
a
strong
man
stirs
in
me
there
a
ghost
of
blood
and
granite
coffined
in
this
madness
carpentered
of
song
you
live
your
day
and
drain
it
i
weave
my
dream
and
lose
it
but
the
red
blood
lost
in
me
awakens
still
at
times
at
all
your
city
at
all
your
roaring
at
all
its
hum
of
power
and
the
poet
dead
within
you
stirs
still
at
the
plaintive
note
or
two
of
a
dreamer
plaintive
song
the
question
i
glad
with
the
wine
of
life
reeling
i
go
my
way
drunk
with
the
ache
of
living
and
mouthing
my
drunken
song
then
comes
the
lucid
moment
and
the
shadow
across
the
lintel
and
i
hear
the
ghostly
whisper
and
i
glimpse
with
startled
eyes
the
door
beyond
the
doorway
and
i
see
the
small
dark
house
where
i
must
sleep
ii
then
song
turns
sour
on
my
lips
and
the
warmth
goes
out
of
my
blood
and
i
turn
me
back
to
the
beaker
and
my
cup
of
dream
i
drown
the
whispering
voices
i
banish
the
ghostly
question
as
to
which
in
the
end
is
true
the
wine
and
the
open
road
or
the
waiting
door
the
gift
of
hate
empty
it
seems
at
times
their
cry
about
love
their
claim
that
love
is
the
only
thing
that
survives
for
i
who
am
born
of
my
centuries
strewn
with
hate
who
was
spewed
into
life
from
a
timeless
tangle
of
sin
i
can
hate
as
strong
and
as
long
as
i
love
there
are
hours
and
issues
i
hate
there
are
creeds
and
deeds
and
doubts
i
hate
there
are
men
i
hate
to
the
uttermost
and
although
in
their
graves
they
listen
and
weep
earth
mothers
and
wistful
women
who
cried
for
peace
i
hate
this
king
of
evil
who
has
crowned
my
heart
with
hate
the
dream
i
lay
by
your
side
last
night
by
you
in
my
dreams
i
felt
the
damp
of
the
grave
i
was
dead
with
you
and
my
bones
still
ache
with
death
for
my
hand
went
out
and
i
touched
your
lips
and
i
found
them
fallen
away
wasted
and
lost
those
lips
once
warm
with
life
were
eaten
and
gone
and
my
soul
screamed
out
in
the
dark
at
the
intimate
blackness
of
death
and
then
i
arose
from
the
dead
and
returned
to
the
day
and
my
bones
and
my
heart
still
ache
with
it
all
and
i
hunger
to
hear
the
relieving
babble
of
life
the
crowd
in
the
hurrying
street
the
tumult
and
laughter
and
talk
to
make
me
forget
one
room
in
my
heart
one
room
in
my
heart
shall
be
closed
i
said
one
chamber
at
least
in
my
soul
shall
be
secret
and
locked
i
shall
hold
it
my
holy
of
holies
and
no
one
shall
know
it
but
you
calm
woman
predestined
with
casual
hands
you
came
with
this
trivial
key
and
ward
by
obdurate
ward
the
surrendering
lock
fell
back
and
disdainfully
now
you
wander
and
brood
and
wait
in
this
room
that
i
thought
was
my
own
the
meaning
it
is
the
sea
that
i
love
but
the
ships
that
must
dare
and
endure
and
defy
and
survive
it
it
is
the
flesh
that
i
love
but
the
spirit
that
guides
and
derides
and
controls
and
outlives
it
it
is
this
earth
that
i
love
but
the
mortals
who
give
to
it
meaning
and
colour
and
passion
and
life
for
what
is
the
sea
without
ships
and
what
is
the
flesh
without
soul
and
what
is
a
world
without
love
the
veil
you
have
said
that
i
sold
my
life
for
a
song
laid
bare
my
heart
that
men
might
listen
and
go
their
ways
my
inchoate
heart
that
i
dare
not
plumb
that
goes
unbridled
to
the
depths
of
hell
that
sings
in
the
sun
to
the
brink
of
heaven
i
have
tossed
you
the
spindrift
born
of
its
fretting
on
its
shallowest
coast
but
over
the
depths
of
it
bastioned
in
wonder
and
silent
with
fear
god
sits
with
me
the
man
of
dreams
all
my
lean
life
i
garnered
nothing
but
a
dream
or
two
these
others
gathered
harvests
and
grew
fat
with
grain
but
no
man
lives
by
bread
and
bread
alone
so
forgetful
of
their
scorn
when
starved
they
cried
for
life
i
gave
them
my
last
dreams
i
bared
for
them
my
heart
that
they
might
eat
april
on
the
rialto
a
canyon
of
granite
and
steel
a
river
of
grim
unrest
and
over
the
fever
and
arches
the
azure
of
dream
and
fretting
along
the
tumult
threading
the
iron
curbs
tawdry
in
tinsel
and
feather
drift
the
daughters
of
pleasure
the
traders
in
song
the
makers
of
joy
the
columbines
of
the
city
seeking
their
ends
but
under
the
beaded
under
the
lip
with
its
rouge
under
the
mask
of
white
splashed
with
as
god
own
arch
of
azure
leans
softly
over
the
street
surely
this
day
runs
warmer
the
blood
through
a
wasted
breast
the
surrender
must
i
round
my
life
to
a
song
as
the
waves
wear
smooth
the
shall
the
mortal
beat
and
throb
of
this
heart
of
mine
be
only
to
crumble
a
dream
and
fashion
the
pebbles
of
fancy
that
the
tides
of
time
may
cover
or
a
child
may
find
little
in
truth
it
matters
but
this
at
the
most
i
know
infinite
is
the
ocean
that
thunders
upon
man
soul
and
the
sooner
the
soul
falls
broken
the
smoother
will
be
its
song
the
passing
ere
the
thread
is
loosed
and
the
sands
run
low
and
the
last
hope
fails
wherever
we
fare
o
fond
and
true
may
it
fall
that
we
come
in
the
end
come
back
to
the
crimson
valleys
back
to
the
indian
summer
back
to
the
northern
and
the
grey
lakes
draped
with
silence
and
the
sunlight
thin
and
poignant
and
the
leaf
that
flutters
earthward
and
the
skyline
green
and
lonely
and
the
ramparts
of
the
dead
world
ruddy
with
wintry
rose
may
we
fare
o
fond
and
true
through
our
indian
summer
through
the
paling
twilight
weather
and
facing
the
lone
green
uplands
and
greeting
the
hills
step
into
the
pineland
shadows
and
enter
the
sunset
valley
and
go
as
the
glory
goes
out
of
the
dreaming
autumn
out
of
the
drifting
leaf
and
the
dying
light
protestations
if
i
tire
of
you
beautiful
woman
i
know
that
the
fault
is
mine
yet
not
all
mine
the
failure
and
not
all
mine
the
loss
in
loveliness
still
you
walk
but
i
have
walked
with
sorrow
i
have
threaded
narrows
and
i
have
passed
through
perils
that
you
know
nothing
of
and
i
in
my
grief
have
gazed
in
eyes
that
were
not
yours
and
my
emptier
hours
have
known
the
sigh
of
kindlier
bosoms
the
kiss
of
kindlier
mouths
yet
the
end
of
all
is
written
and
nothing
o
woman
you
ever
may
dream
or
do
henceforth
can
bring
me
anguish
or
crown
my
days
with
joy
tears
o
stately
woman
you
said
could
float
your
soul
so
little
a
thing
it
seemed
yet
all
that
left
of
life
i
give
to
know
your
love
i
give
to
show
my
love
and
feel
your
kiss
again
i
sat
in
the
sunlight
i
sat
in
the
sunlight
thinking
of
life
i
sat
there
dreaming
of
death
and
a
moth
alit
on
the
face
and
the
birds
sang
sleepily
and
the
leaves
stirred
and
the
sun
lay
warm
on
the
hills
and
the
afternoon
grew
old
so
some
day
i
knew
the
birds
would
sing
and
the
leaves
would
stir
and
the
afternoon
grow
old
and
i
would
not
be
there
and
the
warmth
went
out
of
the
day
and
a
wind
blew
out
of
the
west
where
i
sat
and
the
birds
were
still
