day
in

spring
one
through

goes
wandering

late
the
snow
has
blown
across
beneath

leaves

i

life
whose
days
are
brief
for
i
have
walked
close
hand
in
hand
with
grief
and
i
may
tell
of
shipwrecked
hopes
since
mine
sank
just
outside

happy
harbor

still
my
song
is

sunny

whence
came
the
ember
that
touched
our
young
souls
candles
first
with
light
in
shadowy
years
too
distant
to
remember
where
childhood
merges
backward
into
night
i
know
not
but
the
halo
of
those
tapers
has
ever
since
around
all
nature
shone
and
we
have
looked
at
life
through
golden
vapors
because
of
that
one
ember
touch
alone
at
early
those
who
have
heard
the
whispered
breath
of
nature
secret
shibboleth
and
learned
the
to
unroll
the
veil
that
hides
her
inmost
soul
may
follow
but
this
leads
through
mullein
stalks
and
and
he
who
scorning
treads
them
down
would
deem
but
poor
and
those
whom
he
meet
in
homespun
gown
but
they
who
lovingly
retrace
their
steps
to
scenes
i
dream
about
will
find
the
hanging
out
with
them
i
claim
companionship
and
for
them
burn
my
at
early
to
these
low
hills
around
which
cling
my
fondest
thoughts
i
would
not
bring
an
alien
eye
long
used
to
sights
among
the
alpine
heights
an
eagle
does
not
bend
its
wing
to
nests
where
robins
sing
between
the
fence
zigzag
rails
the
stranger
sees
the
road
that
trails
its
winding
way
into
the
dark
woods
he
does
not
mark
the
old
log
cabin
at
the
end
as
i
or
hail
it
as
a
friend
or
catch
when
daylight
last
rays
wane
the
glimmer
through
its
narrow
pane
of
early
as
anglers
sit
and
half
in
dream
dip
lazy
lines
into
the
stream
and
watch
the
swimming
life
below
so
i
watch
pictures
come
and
go
and
in
the
flame
see
genii
of
the
past
arise
if
it
be
so
that
common
things
can
fledge
your
fancy
with
fast
wings
if
you
the
language
can
translate
of
lowly
life
and
make
it
great
and
can
the
beauty
understand
that
dignifies
a
hand
look
in
this
halo
and
see
how
the
homely
seems
transfigured
now
at
early
a
where
the
great
logs
roar
and
shine
across
the
puncheon
floor
and
through
the
chinked
walls
here
and
there
the
snow
steals
and
the
frosty
air
meager
and
bare
the
furnishings
but
hospitality
that
kings
might
well
dispense
transmutes
to
gold
the
welcome
given
young
and
old
plain
and
uncouth
in
speech
and
dress
but
richly
clad
in
kindliness
the
neighbors
gather
one
by
one
at
rustic
rout
when
day
is
done
vanish
all
else
in
this
soft
light
the
past
is
ours
again
tonight
is
early
oh
scenes
like
these
the
the
evenings
when
the
quilting
frames
were
laid
aside
for
romping
games
the
singing
school
the
spelling
match
my
hand
still
lingers
on
the
latch
i
fain
would
wider
swing
the
door
and
enter
with
the
guests
once
more
though
into
ashes
long
ago
that
fire
faded
still
the
glow
that
warmed
the
hearts
around
it
met
immortal
burns
within
me
yet
still
to
that
cabin
in
the
wood
i
turn
for
highest
types
of
good
at
early
how
fast
the
scenes
come
flocking
to
my
mind
as
white
sheep
jostle
through
the
gap
when
pasture
bars
are
down
and
pass
into
the
twilight
brown
grandmother
face
and
snowy
cap
the
knitting
work
upon
her
lap
the
creaking
the
the
big
loom
where
the
shuttle
carried
song
and
thread
the
valance
on
the
high
white
bed
whose
folds
the
lavender
still
keep
oh
nowhere
else
such
dreamless
sleep
on
tired
eyes
its
deep
spell
lays
as
that
which
came
in
those
old
days
at
early
a
kitchen
lit
by
one
dim
light
and
the
table
in
affright
a
group
of
children
telling
tales
outside
the
wind
a
banshee
wails
even
the
shadows
that
they
throw
upon
the
walls
to
giants
grow
the
hailstones
the
window
panes
fall
with
the
noise
of
clanking
chains
till
glancing
back
they
almost
feel
black
shapes
from
out
the
corners
steal
and
climbing
to
the
loft
the
witches
follow
them
to
bed
the
low
flame
flickers
snuff
the
wick
for
ghosts
and
goblins
crowd
so
thick
at
early
an
orchard
path
that
tramping
feet
for
half
a
century
have
beat
here
to
the
fields
at
went
the
reapers
here
on
errands
sent
small
loitered
loath
to
go
here
dropped
blooming
snow
through
garden
borders
gaily
set
with
and
bouncing
bet
here
passed
at
dusk
the
harvester
with
quickened
step
and
pulse
astir
at
sight
of
some
one
fluttering
gown
who
stood
with
sunbonnet
pulled
down
and
called
the
cows
ah
in
a
glance
one
reads
that
simple
old
romance
at
early
one
picture
more
a
winter
day
just
done
and
supper
cleared
away
the
romping
children
quiet
grow
and
in
the
reverent
silence
slow
the
old
man
turns
the
sacred
page
guide
of
his
life
and
staff
of
age
and
then
the
while
my
eyes
grow
dim
the
mother
voice
begins
a
hymn
hour
of
prayer
sweet
hour
of
prayer
that
calls
me
from
a
world
of
care
what
wonder
from
those
cabins
rude
came
lives
of
stalwart
rectitude
when
were
the
altars
where
arose
the
vestal
flame
of
prayer
at
early
no
crumbling
castle
walls
are
ours
no
ruined
battlements
and
towers
our
history
on
callow
wings
soared
not
in
time
of
feudal
kings
no
strolling
minstrel
roundelay
tells
of
past
glory
in
decay
but
rugged
life
of
pioneer
has
passed
away
among
us
here
and
as
the
ivy
tendrils
grow
about
the
ancient
turrets
so
the
influence
of
its
sturdy
truth
shall
live
in
youth
when
simple
customs
of
its
day
have
passed
away
with
early
bob
white
just
now
beyond
the
turmoil
and
the
din
of
crowded
streets
that
city
walls
shut
in
i
heard
the
whistle
of
a
quail
begin
bob
white
bob
white
so
faintly
and
far
away
falling
it
seemed
that
a
dream
voice
was
calling
bob
white
bob
white
how
the
old
sights
and
sounds
come
thronging
and
thrill
me
with
a
sudden
longing
through
quiet
country
lanes
the
sunset
shines
fence
corners
where
the
wild
rose
climbs
and
twines
and
blooms
in
tangled
vines
bob
white
bob
white
i
envy
yon
swallow
oh
but
swiftly
to
rise
and
follow
follow
its
flight
follow
it
back
with
happy
flying
where
hills
are
calmly
lying
wheat
fields
whose
golden
silences
are
stirred
by
whirring
insect
wings
and
naught
is
heard
but
plaintive
callings
of
that
one
sweet
word
bob
white
bob
white
and
a
smell
of
the
clover
growing
in
the
meadow
lands
ripe
for
mowing
all
red
and
white
over
the
shady
creek
comes
sailing
past
willows
in
the
water
trailing
tired
heart
is
but
in
dreams
i
turn
my
feet
again
to
wander
in
the
ripening
wheat
and
hear
the
whistle
of
the
quail
repeat
bob
white
bob
white
but
oh
there
is
joy
in
the
knowing
that
somewhere
green
pastures
are
growing
though
out
of
sight
and
the
light
on
those
church
spires
dying
on
the
old
home
meadow
is
lying
grandfather
how
broad
and
deep
was
the
fireplace
old
and
the
great
how
wide
there
was
always
room
for
the
old
man
chair
by
the
cosy
chimney
side
and
all
the
children
that
cared
to
crowd
at
his
knee
in
the
room
for
all
of
the
homeless
ones
who
had
nowhere
else
to
go
they
might
bask
at
ease
in
the
grateful
warmth
and
sun
in
the
cheerful
glow
for
grandfather
heart
was
as
wide
and
warm
as
the
old
fireplace
i
know
and
he
always
found
at
his
board
just
room
for
another
chair
there
was
always
rest
for
another
head
on
the
pillow
of
his
care
there
was
always
place
for
another
name
in
his
trustful
morning
prayer
oh
crowded
world
with
your
jostling
throngs
how
narrow
you
grow
and
small
how
cold
like
a
shadow
across
the
heart
your
selfishness
seems
to
fall
when
i
think
of
that
fireplace
warm
and
wide
and
the
welcome
awaiting
all
the
old
church
close
to
the
road
it
stood
among
the
trees
the
old
bare
church
with
windows
small
and
high
and
open
doors
that
gave
on
meeting
day
a
welcome
to
the
careless
passer
by
its
straight
uncushioned
seats
how
hard
they
seemed
what
form
they
always
wore
to
little
heads
that
could
not
reach
the
text
and
little
feet
that
could
not
reach
the
floor
what
wonder
that
we
hailed
with
strong
delight
the
buzzing
wasp
slow
sailing
down
the
aisle
or
sunk
in
sin
beguiled
the
constant
fly
from
weary
heads
to
make
our
neighbors
smile
how
softly
from
the
churchyard
came
the
breeze
that
stirred
the
cedar
boughs
with
scented
wings
and
gently
fanned
the
sleeper
heated
brow
or
fluttered
grandma
barlow
bonnet
strings
with
eyes
across
the
pulpit
bent
the
preacher
droned
in
soothing
tones
about
some
theme
that
like
the
narrow
windows
high
took
in
the
sky
but
left
terrestrials
out
good
worthy
man
his
work
on
earth
is
done
his
place
is
lost
the
old
church
passed
away
and
with
them
when
they
went
there
must
have
gone
that
sweet
bright
calm
my
childhood
sabbath
day
an
pedagogue
slowly
adown
the
village
street
with
groping
cane
and
faltering
feet
he
goes
each
day
through
cold
or
heat
old
daddy
hight
his
hair
is
scant
upon
his
head
his
eyes
are
dim
his
nose
is
red
and
yet
his
mien
is
stern
and
dread
old
daddy
hight
the
village
lads
his
form
descry
while
yet
afar
and
boldly
cry
for
bears
are
scarce
and
rods
are
high
old
daddy
hight
but
when
their
fathers
meet
his
glance
they
nod
and
smile
and
look
askance
he
taught
them
once
the
modoc
dance
old
daddy
hight
how
long
we
cling
to
servitude
how
long
we
keep
the
schoolboy
mood
still
seems
with
awful
power
endued
old
daddy
hight
they
feel
a
cringing
of
the
knee
those
fathers
yet
they
see
adown
the
walk
pace
solemnly
old
daddy
hight
wide
is
his
fame
of
how
he
taught
and
how
he
flogged
and
reckoned
naught
the
toils
and
pains
that
knowledge
bought
old
daddy
hight
he
had
no
lack
of
ways
and
means
to
track
the
loiterers
on
the
greens
he
scorned
all
counterfeits
and
screens
old
daddy
hight
oh
dire
the
day
that
brewed
mishap
that
brought
to
luckless
back
his
strap
to
hanging
head
his
dunce
cap
old
daddy
hight
no
blotted
page
dared
meet
his
eye
the
owner
quaked
and
wished
to
die
when
rod
in
hand
with
wrath
strode
by
old
daddy
hight
he
helped
them
up
the
thorny
steep
of
wisdom
path
with
pain
to
creep
with
vigilance
that
might
not
sleep
old
daddy
hight
now
down
his
life
long
slow
decline
he
walks
alone
at
the
last
of
his
illustrious
line
old
daddy
hight
her
inside
the
cottage
door
she
sits
just
where
the
sunlight
softest
there
slants
down
on
snowy
kerchief
bands
on
folded
hands
and
silvered
hair
the
garden
pale
her
world
shuts
in
a
simple
world
made
sweet
with
thyme
where
life
soft
lulled
by
droning
bees
flows
to
the
lapsing
rhyme
poor
are
her
cottage
walls
and
bare
too
mean
and
small
to
harbor
pride
yet
with
a
musing
gaze
she
sees
her
broad
domains
extending
wide
green
slopes
of
hills
and
waving
fields
with
blooming
hedges
set
between
through
shifting
veils
of
tender
mist
smile
half
revealed
a
mingled
scene
all
hers
for
lovingly
she
holds
a
yellow
packet
in
her
hand
whose
ancient
faded
script
proclaims
her
title
to
this
spreading
land
old
letters
on
the
trembling
page
drop
unawares
unheeded
tears
these
are
her
her
lands
spread
through
the
realms
of
years
interludes
voices
of
the
old
old
days
oh
voices
of
the
old
old
days
speak
once
again
to
me
i
walk
alone
the
old
old
ways
and
miss
your
melody
i
close
my
tired
eyes
and
hear
the
rain
drip
slow
and
dream
a
hand
is
on
my
brow
that
pressed
it
long
ago
my
thoughts
stray
through
the
lonely
night
until
i
seem
to
see
home
faces
in
the
firelight
that
always
smiled
on
me
those
shadows
dancing
on
the
walls
are
not
by
embers
cast
they
are
the
forms
my
heart
recalls
from
out
the
happy
past
forgotten
is
the
gathering
gloom
the
night
deep
loneliness
as
round
me
in
the
silent
room
with
noiseless
tread
they
press
though
in
the
dark
the
rain
sobs
on
i
heed
its
sound
no
more
for
voices
of
the
old
old
days
are
calling
as
of
yore
silent
keys
as
we
would
touch
with
soft
caress
the
brow
of
one
who
dreams
the
spell
of
sleep
to
break
across
the
yellowed
keys
i
sweep
my
hand
the
old
remembered
music
to
awake
but
something
drops
from
out
those
melodies
there
are
some
silent
keys
so
is
it
when
i
call
to
those
i
loved
who
blessed
my
life
with
tender
care
and
fond
so
is
it
with
those
early
dreams
and
hopes
some
voices
answer
and
some
notes
respond
but
in
the
chords
that
i
would
strike
like
these
there
are
some
silent
keys
heart
dost
thou
hear
not
in
those
pauses
fall
a
still
small
voice
that
speaks
to
thee
of
peace
what
though
some
hopes
may
fail
some
dreams
be
lost
though
sometimes
happy
music
break
and
cease
we
might
miss
part
of
heaven
minstrelsies
but
for
these
silent
keys
part
ii
retrospection
the
grandsire
in
the
chimney
corner
takes
the
almanac
from
its
accustomed
place
and
while
the
kettle
swings
upon
the
crane
and
firelight
flickers
on
his
wrinkled
face
reviews
the
slow
procession
of
the
months
and
sees
again
upon
the
hills
of
green
the
gypsy
springtime
pitch
her
airy
tent
among
the
blossoms
then
the
silver
sheen
of
harvest
moon
shines
down
on
rustling
corn
until
the
hazy
air
of
autumn
thrills
with
sound
of
woodman
ax
and
hunter
horn
and
darker
shadows
climb
the
russet
hills
but
while
he
ponders
on
the
open
page
the
last
sand
in
the
slips
away
the
end
seems
near
of
his
long
pilgrimage
and
he
would
call
the
fleeting
year
to
stay
but
passing
on
she
goes
a
nun
to
take
within
the
convent
of
the
past
the
veil
of
silence
then
the
gates
swing
shut
and
time
the
grim
old
warden
bolts
them
fast
no
more
can
come
again
those
halcyon
days
the
year
took
with
it
to
its
cell
but
often
at
the
bars
they
stand
and
gaze
when
through
the
heart
rings
memory
echoes
from
erin
across
old
purple
mountain
i
hear
a
bugle
call
and
down
the
rocks
like
water
the
echoes
leap
and
fall
one
note
alone
can
startle
the
voices
of
the
peaks
and
waken
songs
of
erin
the
bugle
speaks
they
call
and
call
and
call
until
the
voices
all
ring
down
the
dusky
hollows
and
in
the
distance
fall
methinks
like
purple
mountain
the
past
will
sometimes
rise
and
memory
call
awaken
its
echoing
replies
within
the
tower
of
shandon
again
the
bells
will
sway
and
follow
with
their
ringing
the
lee
upon
its
way
and
chime
and
chime
and
chime
where
ivy
tendrils
climb
till
bells
and
river
mingle
to
sound
the
silvery
rhyme
again
the
daisied
grasses
beside
the
castle
walls
will
stir
with
softest
sighing
to
hear
the
wind
footfalls
and
through
the
abbey
along
killarney
shore
the
melodies
of
erin
will
echo
evermore
and
roll
and
roll
and
roll
till
spirit
hands
shall
toll
the
music
of
the
uplands
unto
the
listening
soul
an
alpine
valley
oh
happy
valley
at
the
mountain
feet
if
half
your
happiness
you
could
but
know
though
over
you
a
shadow
always
falls
and
far
above
you
rise
those
heights
of
snow
so
far
your
yearning
love
you
may
not
speak
with
rosy
flush
like
some
high
sister
peak
yet
you
may
clasp
its
feet
in
fond
embrace
and
gaze
up
in
its
face
and
sometimes
down
its
slopes
a
wind
will
come
and
bring
a
sudden
noiseless
sweep
of
snow
like
a
soft
greeting
from
those
summits
sent
to
comfort
you
below
what
more
love
may
not
ask
too
great
a
boon
enough
to
be
so
near
though
cast
so
low
think
that
a
sea
had
rolled
between
you
twain
if
careless
fortune
had
decreed
it
so
and
you
could
only
lie
and
look
across
to
distant
cloudy
heights
and
know
your
loss
and
see
some
favored
valley
fair
and
sweet
heap
flowers
at
its
feet
through
an
amber
pane
by
some
strange
alchemy
that
turns
to
gold
the
light
that
drops
from
gray
and
leaden
skies
though
heavy
mists
the
outer
world
enfold
is
always
sunshine
where
napoleon
lies
no
more
an
exile
by
an
alien
sea
forgetful
of
the
banishment
and
bane
now
lies
he
there
in
kingly
dignity
his
tomb
a
mecca
shrine
beside
the
seine
and
there
the
pilgrim
hears
the
story
told
how
paris
placed
above
her
hero
dead
a
window
that
should
turn
to
yellow
gold
the
light
that
on
his
resting
place
is
shed
so
on
him
falls
though
summers
wane
the
sunshine
of
that
amber
pane
by
some
strange
miracle
maybe
divine
the
sunlight
falls
upon
the
buried
past
and
turns
its
water
into
sparkling
wine
and
gilds
the
coin
its
coffers
have
amassed
could
it
have
been
those
halcyon
days
trailed
not
a
cloud
across
our
april
sky
faltered
we
not
along
those
untried
ways
grew
we
not
weary
as
the
days
went
by
ah
yes
but
unreturning
feet
forget
rough
places
trodden
in
the
long
ago
only
paths
with
flowers
beset
while
pressing
onward
wearily
and
slow
for
memory
windows
but
retain
the
sunshine
of
an
amber
pane
the
little
white
anemone
by
one
round
dewdrop
may
be
fully
filled
and
by
some
passing
its
cup
of
crystal
water
may
be
spilled
so
does
the
child
heart
hold
its
happiness
a
drop
will
fill
it
to
its
rosy
rim
it
is
not
that
these
later
days
bring
less
that
joy
so
rarely
rises
to
the
brim
it
is
because
the
heart
has
deeper
grown
a
fuller
knowledge
must
its
thirst
assuage
perhaps
we
would
not
deem
those
pleasures
flown
as
bright
as
those
which
star
the
present
age
had
not
upon
them
long
years
lain
the
sunshine
of
an
amber
pane
the
dust
of
dim
forgetfulness
piles
fast
upon
the
chains
that
thralled
us
yesterday
so
will
it
be
when
this
day
too
is
past
and
in
its
arms
we
seen
it
bear
away
the
cares
that
brooded
in
the
tired
brain
the
work
that
weighted
down
the
weary
hand
the
high
hopes
that
we
struggled
to
attain
the
problems
that
we
could
not
understand
washed
of
its
stain
bereft
of
any
sting
seen
through
the
window
of
the
memory
perchance
a
gentler
grace
to
it
may
cling
than
we
may
now
think
possible
to
see
for
skies
will
gleam
though
gray
with
rain
like
sunshine
through
that
amber
pane
we
may
not
stand
on
patmos
and
look
through
the
portals
where
the
great
pearls
gleam
no
brush
that
unveiled
beauty
ever
drew
save
one
that
caught
its
shadow
in
a
dream
so
lest
we
falter
faithless
and
afraid
the
merciful
remembering
we
are
dust
reveals
not
heaven
for
which
our
hearts
have
prayed
but
by
a
token
teaches
us
to
trust
and
day
by
day
allows
us
to
look
through
the
window
of
the
memory
broad
and
vast
till
jasper
minarets
rise
into
view
upon
the
happy
heaven
of
the
past
and
gives
till
purer
light
we
gain
the
sunshine
of
that
amber
pane
at
a
tenement
window
sometimes
my
needle
stops
with
thread
not
often
though
each
moment
waste
means
bread
and
missing
stitches
leave
the
little
mouths
unfed
i
look
down
on
the
dingy
court
below
a
tuft
of
grass
is
all
it
has
to
show
a
broken
pump
where
thirsty
children
go
above
there
shines
a
bit
of
sky
so
small
that
it
might
be
a
passing
wing
one
tree
leans
up
against
the
high
brick
wall
and
there
the
sparrows
twitter
of
the
spring
until
they
waken
in
my
heart
a
cry
of
hunger
that
no
bread
can
satisfy
always
before
when
maytime
took
her
way
across
the
fields
i
followed
close
i
can
but
dream
of
all
her
bright
array
my
work
drops
down
across
the
sill
i
lean
and
long
with
bitter
longing
for
unseen
paths
where
budding
woods
grow
green
the
water
trickles
from
the
pump
below
upon
the
stones
with
eyes
half
shut
i
hear
it
falling
in
a
pool
where
rushes
grow
and
feel
a
cooling
presence
drawing
near
and
now
the
sparrows
chirp
again
no
hark
a
singing
as
of
some
far
meadow
lark
it
is
the
same
old
miracle
applied
unto
myself
that
on
the
the
few
small
loaves
and
fishes
multiplied
behold
how
strange
and
sweet
the
mystery
the
birds
the
broken
pump
the
gnarled
tree
have
brought
the
fullness
of
the
spring
to
me
for
in
the
leaves
that
rustle
by
the
wall
all
forests
find
a
tongue
and
so
that
grass
can
with
its
struggling
tuft
of
green
recall
wide
meadows
where
the
cattle
pass
how
it
can
be
but
dimly
i
divine
these
crumbs
god
given
make
the
whole
loaf
mine
a
song
hearts
are
longfellow
there
will
be
distant
journeyings
enough
to
reach
that
land
beyond
the
ether
sea
to
satisfy
the
veriest
roaming
heart
let
me
stay
home
with
thee
there
will
be
new
companionships
enough
in
that
bright
why
should
we
flee
so
soon
to
alien
hearts
and
stranger
scenes
i
would
stay
home
with
thee
the
heart
grows
homesick
thinking
of
the
change
when
these
familiar
things
no
more
shall
be
when
the
thought
of
them
perchance
shall
fade
let
me
stay
home
with
thee
i
would
imprint
upon
my
mind
each
scene
each
meadow
path
and
stream
and
beloved
since
childhood
holy
with
our
hopes
sweet
with
the
thoughts
of
thee
and
each
dear
household
place
let
me
learn
all
by
heart
where
i
am
wont
thy
form
to
see
who
knows
what
things
shall
pass
if
i
may
share
a
hearth
in
heaven
with
thee
eclipse
god
keep
us
from
the
sordid
mood
that
shrinks
to
that
sees
no
thing
as
good
or
grand
that
answers
not
the
hour
demand
and
throws
heaven
splendors
furled
the
shadow
of
our
little
world
in
the
dark
here
in
the
dark
i
lie
and
watch
the
stars
that
through
the
soft
gloom
shine
like
eyes
behind
a
mourner
veil
the
darkness
seems
almost
a
vapor
palpable
and
dense
in
which
my
room
familiar
outlines
melt
and
all
seems
one
black
pall
that
folds
me
round
only
a
mirror
glimmers
through
the
dusk
and
on
the
wall
a
dim
uncertain
square
shows
where
a
portrait
hangs
ah
even
so
beloved
faces
fade
into
the
past
and
naught
remains
except
a
space
of
light
to
show
us
where
they
were
how
still
it
seems
the
busy
clock
whose
talk
was
drowned
by
day
uproarious
voices
calls
aloud
undaunted
by
the
dark
the
flight
of
time
and
through
the
halls
its
tones
ring
drearily
the
breeze
on
tiptoe
seems
to
tread
as
though
it
were
afraid
to
rouse
the
drowsy
leaves
the
long
dim
street
is
quiet
nothing
breaks
the
dream
of
night
asleep
on
nature
breast
hark
some
one
passes
on
the
pavement
stones
each
stealthy
step
gives
back
a
muffled
sound
till
the
last
seems
in
distance
drowned
so
death
might
pass
bent
on
his
mission
dread
adown
the
silent
street
and
none
might
know
what
hour
he
passed
or
what
he
bore
away
ah
sadder
thought
so
life
goes
unawares
noiseless
and
swift
and
resolutely
on
while
the
dumb
world
lies
folded
in
the
gloom
unconscious
and
uncaring
in
its
sleep
and
towards
the
west
the
stars
all
silently
like
golden
sands
in
god
great
glide
and
fall
into
the
nether
crystal
globe
felipa
wife
of
columbus
more
than
the
compass
to
the
mariner
wast
thou
felipa
to
his
dauntless
soul
through
adverse
winds
that
threatened
wreck
and
nights
of
rayless
gloom
thou
pointed
ever
to
the
north
star
of
his
great
ambition
he
who
once
has
lost
an
eden
or
has
gained
a
paradise
by
eve
sweet
influence
alone
can
know
how
strong
a
spell
lies
in
the
witchery
of
a
woman
beckoning
hand
and
thou
didst
draw
him
higher
still
felipa
whispering
the
lessons
learned
from
thy
courageous
father
till
the
flood
of
his
ambition
burst
all
barriers
and
swept
him
onward
to
his
goal
before
the
jewels
of
a
spanish
queen
built
fleets
to
waft
him
on
his
untried
way
thou
gavest
thy
wealth
of
wifely
sympathy
to
build
the
lofty
purpose
of
his
soul
and
now
the
centuries
have
cycled
by
till
thou
art
by
the
throng
that
lauds
the
great
pathfinder
of
the
deep
it
matters
not
in
that
infinitude
of
space
where
thou
dost
guide
thy
to
undiscovered
lands
supremely
fair
if
to
this
little
planet
thou
couldst
turn
and
voyage
wraithlike
to
its
rim
thou
wouldst
not
care
for
praise
and
if
perchance
some
hand
held
out
to
thee
a
laurel
bough
thou
wouldst
not
claim
one
leaf
but
fondly
turn
to
lay
thy
tribute
also
at
his
feet
creek
and
bay
creek
and
bay
we
whisper
to
our
white
sails
stay
oh
life
a
little
while
delay
creek
and
bay
so
loath
to
go
from
these
calm
shallows
that
we
know
we
fain
would
stay
the
year
swift
flow
nor
onward
go
to
banks
more
wide
where
seaward
drawings
of
the
tide
impel
to
deeper
depths
untried
where
life
grows
wide
creek
and
bay
the
morning
deepens
into
day
and
richer
freight
we
bear
alway
when
in
the
bay
when
youth
is
gone
how
can
we
know
when
youth
is
gone
when
age
has
surely
come
at
last
there
is
no
marked
meridian
through
which
we
sail
and
feel
when
past
a
keener
air
our
faces
strike
a
chiller
current
swifter
run
they
meet
and
glide
like
tide
with
tide
our
youth
and
age
when
youth
is
done
the
fickle
heart
canst
tell
me
thou
inconstant
heart
what
like
unto
thou
art
a
gypsy
wandering
up
and
down
through
april
green
and
autumn
brown
until
the
year
is
spent
and
then
when
hills
are
white
with
snow
and
brooks
have
ceased
to
flow
no
place
to
pitch
his
tent
banditti
upon
life
lonely
highway
robber
bands
of
years
seize
with
relentless
hands
each
traveler
and
wrest
from
out
his
grasp
the
treasures
that
he
fain
would
closer
clasp
none
can
escape
each
year
demands
its
toll
till
robbed
of
youth
we
grope
toward
the
goal
halting
and
blind
of
all
but
life
bereft
and
death
claims
that
the
only
boon
that
left
the
silent
brotherhood
on
through
the
cloisters
of
eternity
the
years
like
monks
in
slow
procession
pass
telling
their
rosary
beads
the
golden
days
with
penance
prayers
of
dark
and
dismal
nights
hooded
and
cowled
with
silence
on
they
pass
nor
will
they
pause
until
their
vesper
rings
a
solemn
curfew
at
the
sunset
hour
when
all
the
fires
of
life
are
buried
low
and
all
the
worlds
drop
down
upon
their
knees
to
say
a
last
mass
ere
the
death
of
time
spendthrift
he
was
a
king
one
time
and
they
wrapped
the
ermine
around
him
and
the
bells
rang
out
when
they
crowned
him
rang
with
a
joyful
chime
and
he
sat
on
a
throne
the
wealth
that
a
world
could
offer
was
heaped
in
the
new
year
coffer
for
the
world
was
his
own
he
was
a
spendthrift
though
and
the
coins
of
his
lavish
giving
were
the
golden
moments
of
living
coins
that
he
squandered
so
he
is
a
beggar
now
in
the
night
and
the
storm
he
lingers
no
gold
in
his
prodigal
fingers
king
with
the
uncrowned
brow
nothing
to
call
his
own
his
fortune
scattered
behind
him
death
shall
find
him
a
new
year
takes
his
throne
lost
childhood
flits
by
with
flowers
in
both
its
hands
we
know
not
why
it
leaves
nor
when
it
goes
but
suddenly
we
miss
some
subtle
grace
as
perfume
passes
from
a
fading
rose
we
scarce
divine
yet
somehow
faintly
feel
in
the
soft
air
a
breath
of
snows
straying
afar
unheeded
and
alone
upon
life
highway
the
busy
throng
swept
in
its
eager
restless
race
along
to
the
great
future
unexplored
unknown
the
little
child
is
lost
and
when
with
haste
the
wanderer
footsteps
through
the
streets
are
traced
they
find
a
man
with
features
pale
and
stern
but
the
lost
child
will
nevermore
return
the
robber
do
you
know
why
time
flies
by
so
slow
when
we
are
sad
and
old
why
he
turns
and
waits
as
if
loath
to
go
on
his
journey
cold
because
from
our
coffers
of
hope
and
youth
where
we
kept
life
gold
he
has
stolen
our
treasures
all
in
sooth
from
their
sacred
hold
he
who
came
with
a
gift
in
hand
was
a
robber
bold
he
whose
greeting
was
smooth
and
bland
was
a
wolf
in
the
fold
and
this
is
the
reason
that
he
goes
by
when
we
worn
and
old
so
slowly
because
he
can
scarcely
fly
with
his
weight
of
gold
my
carol
is
the
time
when
holly
berries
grow
red
as
the
glow
and
hearth
and
hall
are
decked
by
all
with
the
green
of
the
mistletoe
time
when
the
joy
of
giving
is
felt
at
each
fireside
and
wings
seek
rest
in
the
old
home
nest
for
the
time
is
though
only
a
carol
singer
with
nothing
of
gold
in
store
and
little
to
bring
as
an
offering
i
stand
outside
your
door
open
this
blessed
morning
peace
be
to
thee
and
thine
here
to
you
all
i
gaily
call
a
greeting
from
me
and
mine
haply
it
may
awaken
some
joy
that
so
long
ago
on
the
frosty
dawn
of
a
christmas
gone
you
found
in
your
stocking
toe
though
but
an
old
old
carol
it
bears
love
myrrh
and
gold
and
the
frankincense
of
a
joy
intense
that
the
angel
hosts
foretold
carol
the
heralds
proclaim
him
follow
a
star
leads
the
way
oh
joy
in
the
city
of
david
the
reigns
i
greet
you
this
blessed
morning
peace
be
to
thee
and
thine
to
the
dear
ones
here
be
christmas
cheer
and
the
love
of
me
and
mine
in
this
cradle
life
of
ours
the
world
swings
slowly
back
and
forth
from
dawn
to
dusk
from
dusk
to
dawn
and
we
forget
the
hand
that
rocks
but
the
world
swings
on
a
little
while
to
stir
and
fret
or
sob
with
trembling
lip
because
the
sunbeams
we
would
grasp
through
helpless
fingers
slip
a
little
while
to
moan
and
start
from
fevered
dreams
and
weep
for
still
the
cradle
sways
and
swings
until
we
fall
asleep
the
broad
earth
pillow
is
so
soft
to
weary
heads
and
who
can
tell
but
through
that
sleep
sound
lullabies
of
the
white
angel
israfel
here
and
there
how
must
they
sing
those
angel
choirs
who
breathe
heaven
pure
sweet
air
they
need
but
waft
it
from
their
lips
to
make
it
music
rare
here
on
these
chill
damp
plains
below
where
stifling
vapors
rise
we
draw
the
heavy
air
of
earth
and
breathe
it
out
in
sighs
the
milky
way
up
the
steep
heights
whereon
god
citadel
is
set
the
prayers
of
mortals
to
that
bourne
for
ages
toiling
in
the
adamant
across
the
sky
a
glittering
path
have
worn
interlude
interlude
within
the
pauses
of
the
anthem
falls
a
hush
and
the
deep
organ
solemn
voice
goes
on
alone
in
a
low
undertone
as
rain
comes
sometimes
with
a
sudden
sweeping
rush
and
then
is
still
save
that
it
slowly
drips
and
falls
from
leaves
at
intervals
so
memory
sings
alone
between
the
busy
hours
when
comes
a
lull
and
naught
is
audible
but
its
low
undertone
so
darkness
drops
between
the
days
an
interlude
when
night
low
sighing
stirs
the
sleepy
solitude
so
when
the
little
cycle
of
this
life
is
rounded
before
the
spirit
enters
into
life
unbounded
it
waits
to
hear
with
bated
breath
the
solemn
interlude
of
death
part
iii
oh
dreary
day
oh
dreary
day
that
had
so
late
a
dawn
oh
dreary
day
so
long
though
early
gone
fold
thy
gray
mantle
round
thy
form
and
go
to
find
the
lost
sun
while
night
comes
on
across
the
plain
with
silent
step
and
slow
i
weary
of
thy
dark
unsmiling
mood
i
weary
of
thy
dull
disquietude
and
thy
complaining
voice
that
tells
of
pain
not
with
the
tempest
trumpet
but
subdued
in
broken
sentences
of
falling
rain
now
soft
as
household
spirit
comes
the
night
and
draws
the
curtains
fanning
still
more
bright
the
cheerful
fire
while
for
her
gentle
sake
the
tapers
burst
in
bloom
with
yellow
light
like
evening
primroses
just
kissed
awake
the
spring
steals
through
the
city
streets
silent
and
shrinking
half
afraid
as
if
there
came
from
woods
and
fields
some
timid
bashful
country
maid
the
lofty
houses
coldly
frown
and
coldly
stares
the
stony
street
but
here
and
there
from
out
a
cleft
there
springs
a
flower
to
kiss
her
feet
and
here
and
there
a
crocus
smiles
a
friendly
greeting
or
a
spray
of
blooming
lilacs
fresh
and
sweet
leans
down
and
nods
across
her
way
till
reassured
she
smiles
and
sings
and
on
she
passes
glad
and
fleet
and
little
children
at
their
play
look
up
to
catch
her
glances
sweet
is
it
her
robe
soft
fluttering
that
gently
fans
the
passer
by
he
only
feels
the
freshened
air
nor
knows
the
gracious
presence
nigh
but
some
sweet
influence
he
feels
that
charms
care
gloomy
shade
away
and
pours
into
his
wakened
heart
the
golden
gladness
of
the
may
so
like
an
angel
visitant
she
glides
among
the
haunts
of
men
and
faint
hearts
bound
and
sad
eyes
smile
because
the
spring
has
come
again
spring
cophetua
she
came
with
garments
scant
and
poor
and
thin
and
white
feet
gleaming
bare
with
pallid
smiles
where
april
tears
had
been
and
snowflakes
on
her
hair
oh
never
winter
thought
such
gentle
look
in
all
the
land
was
seen
from
his
gray
locks
the
diadem
he
took
and
crowned
her
as
his
queen
and
now
in
silken
robes
and
gems
arrayed
fair
spring
reigns
in
his
stead
upon
his
throne
she
sits
the
beggar
maid
cophetua
is
dead
winter
beauty
when
i
go
through
the
meadows
brown
where
stand
the
tall
weeds
sere
and
dead
think
you
i
find
no
beauty
there
since
summer
through
the
fields
has
fled
the
edges
of
the
frozen
stream
whose
quiet
waters
late
were
crossed
by
shadows
of
the
bending
fern
are
fair
with
fringes
of
the
frost
wherever
cowslips
crowded
thick
or
banks
of
buttercups
would
be
a
host
of
airy
forms
in
white
like
ghosts
of
flowers
returned
i
see
it
may
be
clustered
flakes
of
snow
or
frozen
dew
still
glistening
there
but
still
it
seems
as
if
there
came
a
rare
strange
odor
through
the
air
october
across
the
stubble
fields
the
lazy
breezes
pass
from
autumn
orchards
sloping
southward
in
the
sun
where
dropping
from
the
branches
one
by
one
the
apples
hide
in
tangles
of
the
grass
a
warm
sweet
scent
of
mellow
fruit
fills
all
the
air
and
faintly
over
hills
and
hollows
comes
the
cry
of
some
shrill
bluejay
and
his
mate
reply
like
ruth
the
winds
will
go
by
and
by
and
garner
in
the
leaves
till
all
the
woods
are
bare
but
now
my
boyhood
love
has
come
again
to
me
october
in
her
royal
red
and
gold
arrayed
she
comes
with
glowing
cheeks
my
dusky
indian
maid
and
all
the
world
seems
bright
because
so
bright
is
she
unto
her
lips
the
wild
grapes
hold
their
spicy
wine
persimmons
sweet
and
golden
with
an
early
frost
drop
at
her
feet
and
where
the
narrow
creek
has
crossed
the
woods
and
in
the
ferns
and
flag
its
way
has
lost
the
corals
of
the
berries
shine
and
thus
she
comes
my
love
i
loved
when
i
was
young
we
wander
for
a
little
while
across
the
hills
and
as
of
old
her
sunny
presence
warms
and
fills
my
heart
but
like
a
lute
with
one
string
left
unstrung
when
i
would
sing
again
the
song
of
other
years
something
is
lost
the
harmony
is
incomplete
and
though
the
same
old
melody
i
still
repeat
one
alto
note
of
joy
is
gone
that
made
it
sweet
and
something
trembles
in
the
autumn
haze
like
tears
at
twilight
a
tiny
bird
flits
through
the
twilight
brown
when
sunset
dreams
make
all
the
garden
fair
whose
soft
notes
fall
into
the
quiet
air
like
olive
leaves
on
waters
smooth
dropped
down
emblems
of
rest
when
floods
of
care
do
cease
into
my
heart
as
well
they
fall
and
float
an
olive
leaf
each
faint
and
dreamy
note
i
recognize
their
sign
and
feel
at
peace
the
prophet
darkness
and
silence
such
as
only
fall
at
midnight
wrap
the
sleeping
hamlets
all
no
life
in
all
the
dim
world
seems
to
be
then
suddenly
across
the
hills
far
off
and
faint
i
hear
sound
through
the
dark
as
through
a
dream
the
call
how
strange
it
seems
of
some
bold
chanticleer
half
in
my
sleep
i
hear
that
clarion
ring
with
distant
calls
like
echoes
answering
and
as
at
war
alarum
soldiers
leap
from
guarded
sleep
and
seize
their
arms
and
hasten
from
their
tents
so
at
this
sound
my
drowsy
senses
spring
alert
to
man
the
mind
dark
battlements
to
tell
night
tolls
no
startled
bell
only
thy
voice
is
heard
brave
sentinel
who
like
the
ancient
watchman
on
the
towers
calls
forth
the
hours
and
to
the
wistful
questioners
who
see
no
gleam
through
pain
long
vigil
dost
foretell
the
morning
cometh
oft
and
cheerily
how
canst
thou
know
when
weary
with
his
race
the
day
turns
back
his
pathway
to
retrace
canst
thou
the
maiden
dawn
light
footsteps
hear
approaching
near
or
dost
thou
stand
in
converse
with
the
skies
and
know
what
time
she
leaves
her
by
joyful
flashes
of
their
starry
eyes
thou
art
a
prophet
like
to
those
of
old
who
in
the
darkness
sat
but
firm
and
bold
looked
with
undaunted
eyes
towards
the
dim
horizon
rim
and
thrilled
with
faith
of
waiting
ages
born
that
soon
from
out
the
night
strong
prisonhold
should
burst
the
golden
glory
of
the
morn
the
potter
field
just
outside
of
the
noisy
town
half
through
thicket
and
wood
revealed
hemmed
about
by
a
wall
of
stone
wide
it
lieth
the
potter
field
brambles
wander
across
the
grass
vines
creep
over
the
broken
wall
bindweeds
blossom
and
here
and
there
stands
a
waif
of
the
forest
tall
there
no
columns
of
gleaming
white
mark
the
dust
that
is
sacred
still
swings
the
gate
on
its
rusty
hinge
all
may
enter
and
roam
at
will
who
should
hinder
the
ruthless
hand
who
protect
from
a
vagrant
tread
guard
the
urns
of
the
rich
and
great
no
one
cares
for
the
pauper
dead
outlawed
felon
and
sinless
child
all
find
room
in
the
potter
field
there
lies
a
judas
who
sold
his
lord
here
a
mary
his
pity
healed
who
could
know
of
the
shame
and
sin
safely
under
the
sod
concealed
weary
burdens
of
want
and
grief
laid
away
in
the
potter
field
who
could
guess
for
as
swift
and
light
it
the
feet
of
the
seasons
go
summer
hides
it
with
grace
of
flowers
winter
spreads
it
with
folds
of
snow
rains
weep
over
the
lonely
mound
sunlight
lingers
and
swift
shades
pass
tender
hands
of
the
gentle
wind
smooth
the
knots
of
the
tangled
grass
what
though
hallowed
by
death
alone
rest
unbroken
the
sod
doth
yield
peace
is
here
for
his
constant
watch
god
doth
set
the
potter
field
left
out
well
he
knew
that
his
clothes
were
poor
he
was
common
he
humbly
thought
child
as
he
was
he
could
understand
why
he
was
slighted
and
never
sought
yet
could
he
help
it
his
mother
gone
help
the
weight
of
his
father
shame
hardest
sentence
of
childish
law
blaming
innocence
not
to
blame
it
was
hard
when
the
children
played
all
together
to
be
left
out
stand
aside
with
a
stinging
sense
that
was
he
that
they
laughed
about
thoughtless
children
they
felt
no
wrong
pushed
him
out
of
the
ring
at
play
no
one
heard
how
his
voice
was
choked
no
one
cared
when
he
stole
away
no
one
saw
how
he
crept
at
last
through
the
gate
and
the
grasses
deep
past
the
wall
to
a
lonely
grave
where
his
mother
was
laid
asleep
could
she
feel
in
her
narrow
bed
wee
cold
hands
as
they
groped
about
feel
the
tears
that
were
dropped
because
even
her
grave
had
left
him
out
our
father
i
have
no
part
with
all
the
great
proud
world
it
cares
not
how
i
live
nor
when
i
die
but
every
lily
smiling
in
the
field
and
every
tiny
sparrow
darting
by
claims
kinship
with
me
mortal
though
they
be
the
one
who
cares
for
them
doth
care
for
me
a
madrigal
woodbine
the
wild
bee
clings
to
it
most
fond
and
long
the
wild
bird
sings
to
it
its
sweetest
song
the
wild
breeze
brings
to
it
a
life
more
strong
so
all
things
lend
to
thee
some
charm
some
grace
the
world
a
friend
to
thee
in
love
embrace
all
hearts
do
bend
to
thee
in
thy
queen
place
the
time
o
day
if
i
should
look
for
the
time
o
day
on
the
rose
dial
red
i
would
think
it
was
just
the
sunrise
hour
from
the
flush
of
its
petals
spread
and
if
i
would
tell
by
the
i
would
think
it
was
calm
white
noon
and
the
violet
blue
would
tell
by
its
hue
of
the
evening
coming
soon
but
when
i
would
know
by
my
lady
face
i
am
all
perplexed
the
while
for
it
always
starlight
by
her
eyes
and
sunlight
by
her
smile
trailing
arbutus
there
may
be
hearts
that
lie
so
deep
griefs
and
cares
that
weigh
like
drifted
snow
that
love
seems
chilled
in
endless
sleep
and
budding
hopes
may
never
dare
to
grow
yet
under
all
some
memory
trails
its
arbutus
flowers
of
tender
thought
all
buried
in
the
snow
maybe
still
with
the
sweetest
fragrance
fraught
a
mood
something
has
made
the
world
so
changed
something
is
lost
from
field
and
sky
and
the
earth
and
sun
are
sadly
estranged
and
the
songs
of
nature
seemed
turned
to
a
cry
yet
i
heard
my
blithe
little
neighbor
tell
how
fair
is
the
spring
to
see
ah
well
perhaps
the
change
is
in
me
something
has
gone
from
your
smile
sweetheart
something
i
miss
from
your
look
your
tone
though
you
stand
quite
near
we
are
still
apart
you
may
clasp
me
close
but
i
feel
alone
yet
over
and
over
your
love
you
tell
and
as
you
say
it
must
be
ah
well
perhaps
the
change
is
in
me
the
legend
of
the
pansies
one
night
in
fairyland
when
all
the
court
held
carnival
to
welcome
in
the
june
and
to
the
music
flying
feet
were
dancing
on
the
rose
leaves
night
had
strewn
the
naughty
puck
crept
up
the
castle
stair
and
called
the
sleeping
princes
from
their
bed
and
with
their
royal
pages
following
away
the
tricksy
little
fairies
sped
mounted
on
snowy
off
they
raced
startling
the
gnomes
asleep
within
the
shade
of
gloomy
forests
with
their
merry
cries
as
at
forbidden
games
all
night
they
played
but
when
at
sunrise
blew
an
elfin
horn
mischievous
puck
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
the
disobedient
princes
stood
forlorn
like
fell
their
tears
on
grasses
green
for
fairy
children
not
within
the
bounds
of
queen
titania
realm
at
morning
dawn
change
into
blooming
flowers
where
they
stand
and
bloom
there
till
the
summer
time
is
gone
now
where
the
little
princes
played
all
night
in
robes
of
royal
purple
and
of
gold
the
flowers
we
call
pansies
sprang
in
sight
and
round
them
stood
the
little
pages
bold
in
liveries
of
yellow
blue
and
white
while
upward
through
the
east
the
great
sun
rolled
then
some
repentant
sadly
drooped
their
heads
some
turned
their
saucy
faces
to
the
sky
but
now
they
all
alike
must
wait
the
day
when
they
can
bid
the
summer
time
sometimes
when
bees
upon
their
busy
rounds
stop
to
deliver
some
sweet
message
sent
from
fairyland
the
thoughtful
faces
smile
and
seem
to
grow
a
little
more
content
when
cooling
shadows
creep
along
the
grass
and
mother
birds
are
twittering
lullabies
to
sleepy
nestlings
then
the
south
winds
pass
and
close
with
fingers
soft
the
pansies
eyes
upon
the
wings
of
dreams
they
borne
along
to
loving
arms
that
rock
them
all
the
night
and
fairy
voices
soothe
their
sleep
with
song
till
they
are
waked
by
kisses
of
the
light
the
tower
of
babel
once
many
centuries
ago
men
tried
to
build
a
tower
so
high
that
rising
upward
round
on
round
its
pinnacle
should
reach
the
sky
and
as
they
toiled
and
built
and
dreamed
and
planned
what
hopes
went
upward
with
the
rising
stone
that
daring
feet
ere
long
should
mount
and
stand
upon
the
golden
stairway
to
the
throne
and
then
a
dire
confusion
fell
upon
the
workers
building
there
men
called
and
shouted
each
to
each
with
strange
uncomprehended
speech
and
what
it
meant
no
one
could
tell
so
they
left
building
in
despair
yet
in
their
hearts
still
lived
the
hope
that
they
might
scale
the
ramparts
of
the
sky
some
day
sometimes
our
souls
expand
and
glow
with
holy
visions
bright
and
pure
but
when
from
these
deep
vales
below
we
proudly
try
to
climb
and
reach
with
clumsy
masonry
of
speech
and
rounds
of
rhyme
that
shall
endure
that
thing
that
heavenly
theme
touched
only
by
a
prayer
or
dream
a
swift
confusion
us
flies
and
sudden
chills
our
hands
benumb
our
minds
are
blurred
our
tongues
are
dumb
the
vision
fades
away
and
dies
yet
still
we
dream
that
song
some
day
may
be
rung
through
the
arches
of
eternity
the
old
bell
the
vines
have
grown
so
thick
and
twined
so
strong
with
clinging
hold
about
the
bell
that
swings
in
the
old
tower
that
now
it
never
rings
no
one
has
heard
its
voice
for
seasons
long
sit
by
me
on
the
broken
belfry
stair
and
i
will
tell
the
simple
tale
to
you
of
those
whose
graves
through
yonder
arch
you
view
scattered
about
the
churchyard
here
and
there
ah
me
how
closely
memory
tendrils
twine
about
the
heart
and
choke
the
words
that
spring
it
only
throbs
the
touch
like
this
old
bell
held
speechless
by
the
vine
the
sea
forever
like
a
heart
that
knows
no
peace
like
one
who
wanders
weary
to
and
fro
about
the
earth
but
finds
no
the
sweeping
tides
of
ocean
ebb
and
flow
like
a
discarded
lover
who
entreats
for
favor
still
and
will
not
be
denied
up
to
the
beach
with
soft
caressing
touch
and
tearful
broken
whispers
steals
the
tide
but
still
repulsed
it
slow
and
sad
withdraws
yet
at
the
dear
one
feet
its
treasures
lays
and
turns
again
to
wail
its
sorrows
out
through
all
the
hopeless
nights
and
dreary
days
married
it
is
such
a
little
while
from
the
time
the
fledgling
tries
to
tip
from
the
edge
of
the
nest
to
the
bough
then
lifts
its
wings
and
flies
till
it
sits
in
its
own
wee
nest
surprised
out
of
growth
or
ken
and
feels
that
in
some
strange
way
it
is
learning
to
fly
again
motherhood
for
two
dear
heads
of
bronze
and
amber
for
baby
eyes
of
blue
and
brown
for
two
who
cling
and
kiss
and
clamber
and
on
my
shoulder
nestle
down
all
little
hearts
are
dearer
to
me
all
little
faces
sweet
and
bright
all
childish
tears
and
woes
undo
me
and
i
would
heal
them
all
sufficiency
the
bird
that
sings
one
only
strain
to
tell
his
passion
and
can
feel
as
much
of
joy
or
pain
as
if
he
knew
a
thousand
more
and
thou
sweet
maid
whose
gentle
thought
in
smiles
or
tears
finds
present
vent
what
feeling
could
thy
soul
be
taught
or
who
has
words
more
eloquent
ophelia
calm
dost
thou
lie
in
no
more
the
glances
of
the
haughty
dane
can
fill
thy
gentle
breast
with
longing
vain
the
waves
that
stilled
thy
heart
have
drowned
thy
pain
and
washed
the
sorrow
from
thy
sweet
pale
face
ophelia
thine
be
the
violets
but
his
the
rue
though
hope
should
sleep
and
deep
regret
should
wake
thy
clasped
hand
from
death
he
could
not
take
the
spell
on
those
mute
lips
he
could
not
break
what
more
with
life
and
love
hast
thou
to
do
ophelia
requiem
sleep
thou
whom
care
so
long
oppressed
care
whispers
by
thy
couch
no

kind
death
has
shut

outer
door
none
can
disturb
thee
sleep
and
rest
thy
hands
are
folded
on
thy
breast
that
throbs
with
life
deep
pain
no
more
though
love
waits
grieving
by
thy
door
he
can
not
enter
sleep
and
rest
elizabeth
elizabeth
thou
comest
a
refreshing
breath
from
meadows
green
where
morning
stays
to
those
who
bear
the
blaze
elizabeth
thou
couldst
look
in
the
eyes
of
death
undaunted
did
he
promise
thee
some
bright
new
scene
of
mirth
or
glee
i
can
not
think
that
time
will
gray
that
head
nor
bear
away
one
dimple
in
those
hid
sure
he
were
daring
if
he
did
elinor
in
that
where
the
sisters
three
are
weaving
the
web
of
destiny
there
floated
once
through
the
fateful
gloom
a
thread
of
sunshine
that
gleamed
upon
the
thread
of
a
life
from
the
distaff
drawn
and
mingling
they
passed
to
the
busy
loom
the
wondering
parcea
looked
and
smiled
as
the
light
grew
into
the
soul
of
a
child
and
in
and
out
and
through
devious
ways
they
wove
it
in
with
the
woof
of
days
but
they
said
on
earth
who
knew
not
the
fates
as
the
lily
chalice
holds
the
dew
so
in
her
heart
at
the
morning
gates
she
caught
the
sunshine
when
she
came
through
on
a
of
flute
and
violin
a
hath
swept
life
violin
and
flute
for
him
they
laughed
and
wept
when
others
found
them
mute
from
his
high
altitude
he
catches
fine
and
clear
the
notes
that
might
elude
a
less
discerning
ear
transposing
to
a
lower
key
the
that
he
hears
he
sets
his
heavenly
melody
to
human
smiles
and
tears
inspiration
the
singer
walks
by
wood
and
rill
by
town
and
stately
river
and
varied
scenes
his
vision
fill
and
make
his
pulses
quiver
but
when
his
song
comes
borne
across
on
winds
from
dreamland
blowing
we
can
not
tell
what
mystic
touch
has
set
his
chimes
we
hear
the
robins
in
his
rhyme
we
see
the
orchards
drifted
with
crests
of
bloom
that
glimmer
white
when
mists
of
tears
are
lifted
a
hundred
tunes
seem
intertwined
to
mingle
in
his
singing
when
but
a
single
rose
perhaps
has
set
his
fancy
winging
on
a
of
irving
welcome
art
thou
o
singer
if
thou
dost
know
a
song
that
makes
the
long
eve
shorter
because
its
joys
are
long
welcome
art
thou
if
thou
canst
bear
away
part
of
the
cares
that
burden
the
dull
and
dreary
day
on
a
of
riley
afterwhiles
unto
him
alone
who
strays
sometimes
through
the
yesterdays
lingering
long
in
wood
and
field
is
the
meaning
all
revealed
of
these
songs
adown
the
rhymes
runs
a
path
to
bygone
times
but
is
found
by
those
alone
who
the
fresh
green
hills
have
known
and
have
felt
the
tender
mood
of
the
country
solitude
who
through
lanes
of
pink
peach
blooms
used
to
see
the
lilac
plumes
nodding
welcome
by
the
door
where
the
come
no
more
blest
the
singer
then
who
leads
back
again
through
clover
meads
old
scenes
we
seem
to
see
fair
as
once
they
used
to
be
who
can
call
from
years
long
gone
friends
we
trusted
leaned
upon
for
whose
sake
we
learned
to
bless
toilworn
hands
and
homespun
dress
as
he
sings
of
them
and
thus
wafts
the
pure
air
back
to
us
of
the
fields
there
comes
again
childhood
faith
in
god
and
man
somehow
i
love
to
look
at
the
picture
i
made
of
her
work
of
an
idle
time
the
summer
of
life
long
year
for
as
i
stand
and
gaze
dreaming
of
those
lost
days
almost
it
seems
to
me
i
can
see
her
sitting
here
that
is
the
way
she
sat
with
her
head
a
trifle
raised
looking
thoughtfully
out
at
a
scene
i
could
never
see
delicate
color
of
rose
dawning
and
dying
down
flushing
the
rare
sweet
face
as
she
listened
or
spoke
to
me
whitest
light
of
the
sky
i
showered
on
her
upturned
brow
gathered
the
darkest
shades
and
brushed
them
into
her
hair
thinking
the
while
i
worked
of
the
law
that
always
sends
the
deepest
shadows
to
follow
the
high
lights
everywhere
now
as
i
sit
and
gaze
at
the
dream
on
the
canvas
caught
sadly
the
thought
comes
back
to
torture
with
unbelief
why
must
it
always
be
that
the
strong
white
light
of
love
is
followed
forevermore
by
the
deepest
shadow
of
grief
when
she
came
home
when
she
comes
home
again
a
thousand
ways
i
fashion
to
myself
the
tenderness
of
my
glad
welcome
riley
when
she
comes
home
i
thought
with
throbbing
heart
that
danced
a
measure
to
my
mind
refrain
again
from
out
the
door
i
leaned
and
looked
where
she
should
come
along
the
leafy
lane
and
then
she
i
heard
the
measured
sound
of
slow
oncoming
feet
whose
heavy
tread
seemed
trampling
out
my
life
i
saw
her
face
then
through
my
brain
a
sudden
numbness
spread
the
earth
seemed
spun
away
the
sun
was
gone
and
time
and
place
and
thought
there
was
no
thing
in
all
the
universe
save
one
who
lay
so
still
and
cold
and
white
unanswering
save
by
a
graven
smile
my
broken
moan
she
had
come
home
yet
there
i
knelt
a
resolve
the
fields
of
thought
are
plowed
so
deep
so
carefully
are
tilled
that
all
the
granaries
of
the
world
with
plenteous
store
are
filled
unless
i
deeper
plow
and
sow
what
sheaf
then
can
i
bring
so
like
the
in
the
field
i
eat
the
wheat
and
sing
stranded
we
found
a
wreck
cast
up
on
the
shore
battered
and
bruised
and
scarred
and
rent
and
i
spoke
aloud
here
was
worthless
work
and
a
barque
unfit
to
the
sea
was
sent
but
he
said
my
friend
in
his
gentle
mood
nay
none
may
say
but
the
barque
was
good
for
none
can
tell
of
the
seas
it
sailed
of
the
waves
it
braved
and
the
storms
withstood
then
we
spoke
no
more
but
i
mutely
mused
and
thought
oh
heart
and
oh
life
of
man
that
we
find
wrecked
we
may
never
know
how
brave
you
were
when
your
course
began
at
last
what
will
you
give
me
o
world
o
world
if
i
run
in
the
race
and
win
will
you
give
me
a
fame
that
can
never
fade
will
you
give
me
a
crown
that
will
never
rust
can
you
save
my
soul
from
the
pall
of
sin
can
you
keep
my
heart
from
the
dust
what
will
you
give
me
o
earth
o
earth
if
i
fight
in
the
fray
and
win
more
than
you
gave
those
kings
who
lay
ages
past
in
forgotten
clay
can
you
give
me
more
than
the
grave
shuts
in
or
the
years
can
bear
away
ashes
to
ashes
dust
to
dust
fame
will
fade
and
crowns
will
rust
give
me
o
earth
but
your
true
embrace
when
the
battle
is
lost
or
won
hide
me
away
from
the
day
white
face
from
the
eye
of
the
dazzling
sun
so
i
may
lay
my
head
on
your
breast
forget
the
struggle
and
be
at
rest
forget
the
laurels
that
fade
away
the
love
that
lasts
but
a
wild
brief
day
forget
it
all
on
your
bosom
pressed
forever
at
rest
at
rest
