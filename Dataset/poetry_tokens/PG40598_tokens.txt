between

from

went
and
soon
the
prison
gained
and
when
her
mother
clasped
her
close
the
happy
child
explained
a
kind
good
man
like
santa
claus
with
hair
as
white
as
snow
he
let
you
out
because
because
i
asked
him
too
you
know
a
christmas
spy
when
poebe
brought
the
wood
and
coal
to
lay
the
fire
what
did
she
see
but
baby
dropped
upon
one
knee
and
peering
up
the
she
never
turned
her
little
head
with
all
its
curly
yellow
hair
i
asked
what
are
you
doing
there
me
look
for
santa
taus
she
said
refreshments
for
santa
claus
it
may
be
late
and
stormy
and
cold
when
santa
claus
reaches
our
street
and
santa
you
know
is
very
old
so
i
leave
him
something
to
eat
and
what
do
you
think
he
would
like
dear
heart
something
nice
and
sweet
she
said
jelly
and
jam
and
a
cranberry
tart
and
a
piece
of
bread
so
there
on
the
sideboard
is
santa
feast
which
her
own
small
hands
have
spread
jelly
and
jam
three
kinds
at
least
and
a
tart
but
is
the
how
the
christmas
tree
was
brought
to
nome
night
of
the
winter
winter
and
night
in
the
city
of
nome
there
where
the
many
are
dwelling
but
no
man
yet
has
a
home
desolate
league
upon
league
and
tundra
and
hill
and
the
dark
of
the
year
when
the
rocker
and
dredge
are
still
by
the
fire
that
is
no
man
hearth
by
the
fire
more
precious
than
gold
they
are
passing
the
time
as
they
may
encompassed
by
storm
and
by
cold
and
their
talk
is
of
and
bedrock
of
claim
by
seashore
or
creek
of
the
brigantine
fast
in
the
this
many
and
many
a
week
wraiths
of
the
mist
and
the
snow
encumber
her
canvas
and
deck
and
the
eskimos
swear
that
a
crew
out
of
ghostland
are
crowding
the
wreck
thus
in
the
indolent
dark
of
the
year
in
the
city
of
nome
they
were
passing
the
time
as
they
might
but
ever
their
thoughts
turned
home
said
the
man
from
the
east
in
god
country
now
where
we
all
like
to
be
you
may
bet
your
life
there
a
big
boom
on
for
the
christmas
tree
and
we
have
one
here
but
there
is
a
shrub
as
high
as
my
hand
nor
the
smell
of
spruce
for
a
hundred
miles
in
all
this
land
then
the
man
from
the
south
arose
i
allow
if
the
tree
could
be
found
i
to
the
fruit
myself
and
stand
ye
a
treat
all
round
done
said
the
man
from
the
west
the
youngest
of
all
was
he
i
lose
my
claim
in
the
ruby
sand
or
i
find
the
tree
the
restless
aurora
is
waving
her
banners
wide
through
the
dome
and
the
man
from
the
west
is
off
while
yet
they
are
sleeping
in
nome
off
ere
the
dawn
with
eskimo
sledge
and
team
he
is
leaving
the
tundra
behind
he
is
climbing
the
source
of
the
stream
on
beyond
sinrock
on
while
the
miles
and
the
dim
hours
glide
on
toward
the
evergreen
belt
that
darkens
the
mountain
side
is
a
hundred
miles
or
more
but
his
team
is
strong
is
swift
and
brief
are
his
slumbers
at
night
in
the
lee
of
the
feathery
drift
there
were
watchful
eyes
there
were
anxious
hearts
in
the
city
of
nome
and
they
cheered
with
a
will
when
the
man
from
the
west
with
his
prize
came
home
and
they
cheered
again
for
the
christmas
tree
that
was
brought
from
far
chained
to
his
sledge
like
a
king
of
old
to
the
conqueror
car
said
the
man
from
the
south
i
to
the
fruit
that
grows
on
the
tree
said
the
man
from
the
east
leave
the
christmas
dinner
and
trimmings
to
me
holly
and
mistletoe
said
the
holly
to
the
mistletoe
of
this
what
canst
know
thou
a
pagan
thou
of
the
leafless
bough
my
leaves
are
green
my
scarlet
berries
shine
at
thought
of
things
divine
to
the
holly
spake
the
mistletoe
matters
not
my
leafless
boughs
but
show
berries
pale
as
pearl
ask
yon
boy
and
girl
if
human
mirth
and
love
be
not
some
sign
of
share
in
things
divine
the
firebrand
ohio
christmas
eve
hark
to
a
story
of
christmas
eve
in
the
lonely
days
of
yore
is
of
the
measureless
savage
woods
by
the
great
lake
windy
shore
of
mother
and
child
in
a
firelit
span
where
the
wilderness
bows
to
the
toil
of
man
christmas
is
coming
and
father
be
here
through
the
woods
he
is
coming
i
know
over
his
shoulder
his
ax
is
laid
and
his
beard
is
white
with
snow
yes
but
look
in
the
fire
my
child
at
the
strange
cities
there
so
bright
and
so
wild
mother
what
are
those
restless
flames
that
close
by
the
window
pass
only
the
firelight
fairies
child
that
dance
on
the
but
look
how
the
sparks
up
the
chimney
fly
up
and
away
to
the
snowy
sky
oh
listen
what
are
those
shuddering
cries
mother
what
can
they
be
only
the
branches
that
grate
on
the
roof
when
the
wind
bends
down
the
tree
now
sing
me
the
song
i
taught
to
you
that
i
myself
as
a
little
child
knew
but
mother
those
flames
dart
back
and
forth
like
balls
of
fire
they
play
and
those
shuddering
cries
are
at
the
door
must
let
us
they
say
my
child
your
father
whistle
i
hear
say
a
prayer
for
him
he
is
coming
near
she
has
seized
the
tongs
she
has
snatched
a
brand
and
waved
it
abroad
at
the
door
through
the
drifting
snow
a
form
she
sees
he
is
safe
in
a
moment
more
safe
and
afar
are
those
shuddering
cries
and
the
baleful
lights
of
the
red
thus
did
it
chance
on
a
christmas
eve
in
the
days
that
are
long
since
fled
but
a
light
so
brave
and
a
gleam
so
true
through
the
waste
of
the
years
is
shed
as
i
think
of
that
blazing
windblown
brand
waved
at
the
door
by
a
slim
white
hand
the
foundling
i
the
good
man
sat
before
the
fire
and
oftentimes
he
sighed
the
good
wife
softly
wept
the
while
her
evening
work
she
plied
one
year
ago
this
happy
time
the
little
marie
died
ii
and
surely
now
if
she
had
lived
she
would
have
reached
my
knee
and
surely
now
if
she
had
lived
how
cunning
would
she
be
in
fancy
each
a
darling
face
beside
their
hearth
could
see
iii
the
door
swung
wide
a
gust
of
wind
the
fitful
candle
blew
was
franz
the
awkward
his
clattering
step
they
knew
but
franz
speak
up
speak
up
and
tell
what
thing
has
chanced
to
you
iv
his
round
blue
eyes
with
wonder
shone
his
bashful
fears
had
fled
i
saw
i
saw
the
cattle
kneel
upon
their
strawy
bed
and
in
a
manger
lay
the
child
a
light
shone
round
his
head
v
he
must
have
dreamed
the
good
man
said
a
vision
it
would
seem
nay
master
for
the
light
shone
bright
on
stall
and
loft
and
beam
then
said
the
good
wife
i
perhaps
might
go
and
dream
this
dream
vi
no
further
words
but
forth
she
fared
with
franz
to
lead
the
way
they
reached
the
barn
whose
sagging
door
shot
out
a
yellow
ray
the
kine
did
kneel
upon
the
straw
as
truthful
franz
did
say
vii
and
there
oh
lovely
lovely
sight
oh
pleading
tender
sight
within
a
manger
lapped
in
hay
a
smiling
rosy
mite
the
good
wife
saw
and
nearer
held
the
lantern
yellow
light
viii
she
took
the
foundling
in
her
arms
and
on
its
sleeping
face
her
tears
and
kisses
fell
in
one
how
great
is
heaven
grace
it
is
the
gift
to
me
to
ease
the
aching
place
meeting
the
kings
by
a
provençal
christmas
postscript
thomas
long
long
ago
in
dear
provence
we
three
three
children
ruddy
with
the
sun
and
blither
none
the
sun
might
see
how
happy
when
the
was
done
the
last
slow
drop
from
out
the
winepress
run
and
when
the
frost
at
morn
was
thick
like
snow
and
when
clotilde
at
evening
sang
and
spun
and
old
folk
by
the
new
fire
ruddy
glow
would
tell
as
i
do
now
the
tales
of
long
ago
those
tales
ah
most
of
all
we
begged
to
hear
the
tales
our
grandsires
from
their
grandsires
had
how
in
the
darkening
undertime
of
year
when
with
snow
the
fields
were
clad
that
blessèd
time
when
nothing
can
be
sad
such
peace
through
christ
dear
might
encircles
all
how
then
the
sleeping
hives
made
murmur
glad
the
white
ox
knelt
within
his
littered
stall
and
voices
strange
and
sweet
were
heard
through
heaven
to
call
we
were
three
children
rené
pierre
annette
the
little
sister
listened
each
held
her
hand
that
touch
i
feel
it
yet
and
all
three
drank
those
tales
of
christmas
tide
the
time
how
shall
we
bide
how
many
days
and
hours
we
know
full
well
almost
the
little
minutes
that
divide
meanwhile
like
music
of
a
hidden
bell
our
beating
hearts
keep
up
the
chime
one
thing
there
was
desired
above
all
things
say
will
they
come
as
ever
from
of
old
the
wise
the
good
the
three
great
eastern
kings
who
brought
rich
gifts
frankincense
myrrh
and
gold
how
often
of
their
names
had
we
been
told
balthasar
melchior
gaspard
splendid
all
and
perhaps
upon
white
steeds
and
tall
or
else
on
camels
with
the
footfall
will
they
at
vespers
be
on
holy
night
and
will
they
stop
and
see
the
little
shrine
where
jesus
lies
beneath
the
star
true
light
as
when
at
first
they
found
him
by
that
sign
hush
rené
hush
and
if
the
eve
be
fine
thou
yes
all
three
shall
go
to
meet
the
kings
but
children
mark
ye
well
these
words
of
mine
each
way
of
four
to
town
the
traveler
brings
so
it
may
chance
ye
miss
them
in
your
wanderings
such
sage
replies
our
questions
would
receive
the
holy
time
drew
near
and
yet
more
near
at
last
it
was
the
morning
of
the
eve
all
day
we
swayed
from
lovely
hope
to
fear
early
nay
is
twilight
mother
dear
at
least
so
very
soon
the
sun
will
set
your
warmest
coats
the
air
is
sharp
and
clear
and
in
your
hurry
children
do
forget
that
baby
feet
tire
soon
remember
annette
no
no
i
do
not
tire
though
fast
i
run
ah
how
we
laughed
to
see
the
red
lips
pout
the
small
sweet
pride
that
would
not
be
outdone
in
such
a
race
by
brothers
big
and
stout
annette
the
first
shall
see
the
kings
no
doubt
it
was
our
grandsire
spake
with
twinkling
eye
yes
yes
she
shall
impatient
to
be
out
we
answered
once
beneath
the
deepening
sky
we
ever
took
the
sunset
way
as
late
birds
thither
fly
for
thus
we
reasoned
with
one
grave
consent
if
yonder
star
above
our
mountain
crest
should
be
that
eastern
star
for
guidance
lent
then
must
the
kings
be
journeying
from
the
west
so
on
we
ran
past
harvest
fields
at
rest
past
sheepfolds
where
the
flock
of
summer
dreamed
full
soon
they
would
be
kneeling
as
we
guessed
and
on
and
on
and
now
at
times
it
seemed
far
down
the
twilight
road
rich
banners
waved
and
gleamed
but
ever
of
enchanted
weft
they
proved
on
sunset
pageant
field
emblazoned
low
and
caravans
still
moving
as
we
moved
at
length
for
straggling
olive
trees
would
show
then
while
less
confident
our
pace
would
grow
wiser
than
i
a
twelvemonth
and
a
day
would
rené
counsel
might
it
not
be
so
as
we
had
heard
our
own
dear
mother
say
roads
are
the
kings
had
come
another
way
no
time
to
lose
we
took
the
homeward
track
the
kings
at
vespers
might
be
lingering
still
soon
were
we
in
the
church
alack
alack
the
kings
had
passed
for
though
they
bore
good
will
to
our
good
parish
yet
must
they
fulfil
the
prayers
of
all
and
there
were
other
folk
who
if
unvisited
would
take
it
is
said
they
must
reach
arle
by
midnight
stroke
sweet
spices
they
have
left
judge
by
the
censer
smoke
we
boys
took
manfully
this
frown
of
fate
but
tears
stood
in
petite
annette
blue
eyes
another
year
my
precious
thou
canst
wait
besides
morn
a
fine
surprise
there
be
for
children
who
are
sage
and
wise
gifts
but
i
may
not
tell
you
now
my
child
was
that
did
such
cure
devise
for
hopes
and
hearts
unreconciled
we
slept
and
dreamed
on
this
and
then
the
morning
smiled
time
passed
we
never
saw
the
kings
ah
well
at
least
the
two
of
us
saw
not
i
know
but
how
shall
i
the
wonder
of
it
tell
there
came
a
winter
wild
and
dim
with
snow
it
seemed
to
us
that
sheeted
ghosts

go
upon
the
wind
that
never
ceased
to
moan
and
one
of
us
with
fever
was
laid
low
like
leaves
the
little
hands
were
tossed
and
thrown
and
on
her
cheek
the
rose
of
fever
was
the
storm

day
threw
off
its
shroud

eve
till
then
by
all

and
suddenly
across
a
scarp
of
cloud
one
crimson
flame
a
parting
sunbeam
shot
it
reached
annette
upon
the
low
white
cot

touched
our

face
with
dreaming
eyes
that

the

of

in

burning
clear
and
on

three
letters
in
a
row
proclaim
the
three
kings

drawing
near

greet
then
on
their
knees
the
turbaned
kings
will
drop
and
fill
her
lap
with
gifts
and
kiss
his
feet
for
they
will
find
her
sitting
still
and
meek
upon
a
bench
beside
some
her
soft
hair
brushing
dear
christkindlein
cheek
and
sunshine
brightness
all
around
each
head
then
while
the
old
folk
smile
through
happy
tears
blame
not
the
children
if
a
shout
they
raise
when
little
with
his
pointed
ears
leans
the
fence
with
puzzled
wistful
gaze
there
too
the
gentle
great
black
ox
will
stand
folk
say
he
knelt
at
night
in
strawy
stall
perchance
he
knows
these

from
eastern

for
now
he
lifts
his
head
with
lowing
call

once
right
glad
of
heart
bent
low
and
in
the
cradle
laid
her
child
and
kissed
him
doing
so
then
with
his
foot
joseph
rocked
the
cradle
to
and
fro
now
thanks
to
thee
good
woman
thanks
for
this
that
thou
hast
done
thus
say
they
both
with
friendly
looks
of
thanks
i
merit
none
yet
holy
mother
pity
me
for
sake
of
thy
dear
son
since
then
a
happy
soul
was
hers
god
blessing
on
her
fell
one
of
the
twelve
her
child
became
that
with
our
lord
did
dwell
thus
was
this
story
told
to
me
which
i
afar
would
tell
the
witch
child
is
elfinell
a
witch
child
from
holy
minster
banned
again
the
old
glad
bells
ring
out
through
all
the
christmas
land
no
gift
might
she
receive
or
give
nor
kneel
to
mary
child
she
watched
from
far
the
joyous
troop
that
past
the
crib
defiled
far
in
the
shadow
of
the
porch
yet
even
there
espied
now
hence
away
unhallowed
elf
the
sacristan
did
chide
hence
till
some
witness
thou
canst
bring
of
gift
received
from
thee
in
his
dear
name
whose
birth
we
sing
but
this
shall
never
be
poor
elfinell
she
turned
away
though
none
for
me
may
speak
yet
there
be
those
may
take
my
gift
and
them
i
go
to
seek
so
flitting
light
through
lonesome
fields
by
summer
long
forgot
she
crossed
the
valley
drifted
deep
the
brook
in
icy
grot
and
gained
at
last
a
still
white
wood
all
hung
with
flowers
of
snow
there
down
she
sat
and
quaintly
called
in
tender
tones
and
low
they
heard
and
came
the
doe
and
fawn
the
squirrel
and
the
hare
and
dwellers
shy
in
earthy
homes
and
wanderers
of
the
air
to
these
she
gave
fresh
leaves
of
kale
to
those
the
soft
white
bread
or
filberts
smooth
or
yellow
corn
so
each
and
all
she
fed
she
fed
them
from
her
hand
she
sighed
might
you
but
speak
for
me
and
say
ye
took
my
christmas
gift
then
i
the
crib
might
see
at
this
those
glad
wild
creatures
join
and
close
the
child
around
they
draw
her
on
she
scarce
knows
how
across
the
snowy
ground
they
crowd
with
soft
warm
furry
touch
they
stoop
with
frolic
wing
grown
strangely
bold
to
haunts
of
men
the
elfin
child
they
bring
they
reach
the
town
the
minster
door
the
door
they
straightway
pass
and
up
the
aisle
and
by
the
priest
that
saith
the
holy
mass
nor
stay
until
they
reach
the
crib
with
all
its
wreathen
greens
and
there
above
with
eyes
of
love
the
looks
and
leans
spake
then
the
priest
to
all
his
flock
forbid
no
more
this
child
to
speak
for
her
god
sendeth
these
his
loved
ones
of
the
wild
was
god
that
made
them
take
her
gift
our
stubborn
hearts
to
shame
melt
hearts
of
ours
and
open
hands
and
give
in
christ
dear
name
thus
elfinell
with
gifts
was
showered
upon
a
christmas
day
the
while
beside
the
altar
font
the
ban
was
washed
away
a
carven
stall
the
minster
shows
whereon
ye
see

babushka
russian
babushka
sits
before
the
fire
upon
a
winter
night
the
driving
winds
heap
up
the
snow
her
hut
is
snug
and
tight
the
howling
winds
they
only
make
babushka
more
bright
she
hears
a
knocking
at
the
door
so
late
who
can
it
be
she
hastes
to
lift
the
wooden
latch
no
thought
of
fear
has
she
the
candle
in
her
hand
shines
out
on
strangers
three
their
beards
are
white
with
age
and
snow
that
in
the
darkness
flies
their
floating
locks
are
long
and
white
but
kindly
are
their
eyes
that
sparkle
underneath
their
brows
like
stars
in
frosty
skies
babushka
we
have
come
from
far
we
tarry
but
to
say
a
little
prince
is
born
this
night
who
all
the
world
shall
sway
come
join
the
search
come
go
with
us
who
go
our
gifts
to
pay
babushka
shivers
at
the
door
i
would
i
might
behold
the
little
prince
who
shall
be
king
but
ah
the
night
is
cold
the
wind
so
fierce
the
snow
so
deep
and
i
good
sirs
am
old
the
strangers
three
no
word
they
speak
but
fade
in
snowy
space
babushka
sits
before
her
fire
and
dreams
with
wistful
face
i
would
that
i
had
questioned
them
so
i
the
way
might
trace
when
morning
comes
with
blessèd
light
i
early
be
awake
my
staff
in
hand
i
go
perchance
those
strangers
i
and
for
the
child
some
little
toys
i
carry
for
his
sake
the
morning
came
and
staff
in
hand
she
wandered
in
the
snow
she
asked
the
way
of
all
she
met
but
none
the
way
could
show
it
must
be
farther
yet
she
sighed
then
farther
will
i
go
and
still
is
said
on
christmas
eve
when
high
the
drifts
are
piled
with
staff
with
basket
on
her
arm
babushka
seeks
the
child
at
every
door
her
face
is
seen
her
wistful
face
and
mild
her
gifts
at
every
door
she
leaves
she
bends
and
murmurs
low
above
each
little
face
by
pillows
white
as
snow
and
is
he
here
then
softly
sighs
nay
farther
must
i
go
a
christmas
offering
i
shall
never
forget
cimabue
madonna
no
nor
the
niche
close
by
in
the
wall
where
on
the
straw
the
bambino
was
lying
while
the
oxen
knelt
in
the
stall
rude
are
the
images
tinsel
the
flowers
but
a
tear
to
the
eye
unconsciously
starts
beholding
the
tribute
the
children
have
rendered
in
the
votive
gift
of
hearts
among
them
a
little
gold
watch
was
hanging
that
told
of
some
sick
child
treasured
wealth
sent
with
a
prayer
that
his
christmas
present
might
be
the
good
gift
of
health
christmas
post
in
when
night
shuts
down
and
the
christmas
eve
has
come
all
through
the
little
town
there
a
joyous
stir
and
hum
now
here
and
now
there
along
the
street
from
windows
wide
open
flung
float
childish
laughter
and
prattle
sweet
in
the
kindly
german
tongue
for
the
happy
moment
at
last
is
here
when
each
child
a
letter
sends
directed
to
dear
the
children
friend
of
friends
then
out
at
the
window
strung
on
a
thread
the
precious
letter
is
cast
though
far
and
high
on
the
night
wind
sped
be
found
and
read
at
last
in
prompt
as
the
day
the
children
awake
to
find
among
the
christmas
branches
gay
answer
kind
the
christmas
sheaf
it
was
a
gleaner
in
the
fields
the
fields
gleaned
long
ago
the
evening
wind
swept
down
from
heights
already
brushed
with
snow
the
gleaner
turned
to
right
to
left
with
searching
steps
forlorn
the
beneath
her
feet
was
sharp
as
any
thorn
but
as
she
stooped
and
as
she
searched
half
blind
with
gathering
tears
beside
her
in
the
field
stood
one
whose
voice
beguiled
her
fears
what
seek
ye
here
this
bitter
eve
the
harvest
long
gone
by
she
lifted
up
her
weary
face
she
answered
with
a
sigh
i
seek
but
some
few
heads
of
wheat
to
nail
against
the
wall
to
feed
at
morn
the
blessed
birds
when
with
loud
chirps
they
call
poor
ever
have
i
been
god
knows
yet
so
poor
before
but
they
might
taste
their
glad
noël
beside
my
cottage
door
then
answer
made
that
presence
sweet
go
home
and
trust
right
well
the
birds
beside
your
cottage
door
shall
find
their
glad
noël
and
so
it
was
from
soundest
sleep
the
gleaner
woke
at
morn
to
see
nailed
up
beside
her
door
a
sheaf
of
golden
corn
and
thereupon
the
birds
did
feast
the
birds
from
far
and
wide
all
know
it
was
our
lord
himself
that
goodly
sheaf
supplied
the
birds
on
the
christmas
sheaf
and
wherefore
the
finch
to
the
starling
said
on
the
christmas
sheaf
as
they
hungrily
fed
wherefore
do
now
the
children
of
men
open
their
hands
when
again
and
again
they
drove
us
away
from
their
plenteous
store
from
the
corn
in
the
field
from
the
that
said
the
starling
i
try
to
explain
they
are
feasting
themselves
and
they
spare
us
this
grain
for
oft
as
they
feast
and
make
merry
they
sing
upon
earth
and
good
will
but
this
thing
said
the
finch
we
birds
have
been
singing
all
year
then
why
not
before
have
they
shared
their
good
cheer
what
the
pine
trees
said
i
heard
the
swaying
pine
trees
speak
as
i
went
down
the
glen
next
year
said
one
the
wind
shall
seek
but
find
me
not
again
i
shall
go
forth
upon
the
seas
a
mast
or
on
me
shall
breathe
the
tropic
breeze
above
strange
stars
shall
gleam
and
i
the
ax
shall
cleave
my
grain
and
many
times
divide
from
my
dear
brood
i
shed
the
rain
and
roof
their
ingleside
then
up
and
spake
a
slender
shaft
that
like
an
arrow
grew
no
breeze
my
leafless
stem
shall
waft
no
ax
my
trunk
shall
hew
but
though
a
single
hour
is
mine
how
happy
shall
i
be
young
hearts
shall
leap
young
eyes
shall
shine
to
greet
their
christmas
tree
two
child
angels
two
child
angels
on
christmas
night
they
stood
on
the
brow
of
heaven
hill
the
stars
beneath
them
were
glancing
bright
and
the
air
was
clear
and
still
that
is
the
earth
that
dazzles
so
that
shines
with
a
glad
and
a
radiant
light
that
is
the
earth
where
long
ago
i
was
born
on
the
christmas
night
thus
said
the
one
and
the
other
replied
forever
dear
is
the
earth
in
my
sight
for
there
full
long
ago
i
died
on
the
holy
christmas
night
the
old
doll
after
little
one
little
one
open
your
arms
now
are
your
wishes
come
true
come
true
here
is
a
love
with
a
thousand
charms
and
see
she
is
reaching
her
hands
out
to
you
put
the
old
doll
by
asleep
let
her
lie
and
open
your
arms
to
welcome
the
new
little
one
little
one
play
your
sweet
part
lavishes
treasure
untold
whisper
fond
words
and
close
to
your
heart
your
warm
little
heart
the
new
idol
enfold
is
so
with
us
all
to
worship
we
fall
before
the
new
shrine
forgetting
the
old
little
one
little
one
wherefore
that
sigh
weary
of
playing
the
long
day
through
but
there
something
that
looks
like
a
tear
in
your
eye
and
your
lips
why
your
lips
are
quivering
too
do
i
guess
aright
it
is
coming
night
and
you
cry
for
the
old
you
are
tired
of
the
new
little
one
little
one
old
loves
are
best
and
the
heart
still
clings
though
the
hands
loose
their
hold
take
the
old
doll
back
in
your
arms
she
shall
rest
when
you
wander
away
to
the
dreamland
fold
with
all
even
so
ere
to
sleep
we
go
the
wavering
heart
wavers
back
to
the
old
ii
the
switch
it
was
the
daughter
of
a
fairy
witch
a
sweet
though
wayward
child
go
naughty
elfinella
bring
a
switch
from
yonder
fruit
tree
wild
it
was
the
charming
time
of
all
the
year
the
darling
month
of
may
and
every
bush
and
thicket
far
and
near
with
leaves
and
flowers
was
gay
poor
elfinella
heard
and
off
she
went
with
lagging
steps
and
slow
to
where
amidst
the
wild
a
fruit
tree
bent
her
branches
spreading
low
with
blossomy
boughs
the
motherly
old
tree
the
tearful
child
begirt
my
twigs
are
clothed
with
flowers
and
you
will
see
the
switch
will
never
hurt
she
broke
a
branch
with
blossoms
thickly
set
and
lightly
homeward
tripped
the
switch
was
used
but
little
did
she
fret
for
she
with
flowers
was
whipped
the
indignant
baby
baby
was
out
with
papa
for
a
walk
when
their
friends
they
met
it
was
oh
and
ah
what
a
darling
she
is
can
the
little
kid
talk
well
no
i
do
think
that
she
can
said
papa
though
she
seems
to
understand
she
was
only
two
but
she
understood
and
her
small
rosy
mouth
was
made
up
to
cry
but
no
she
would
she
would
show
that
she
could
and
mamma
and
pretty
and
laly
she
said
with
a
wave
of
her
hand
a
question
of
spelling
they
were
looking
through
their
book
with
pictures
of
the
zoo
both
too
young
to
read
the
text
but
each
the
pictures
knew
will
was
three
and
ray
was
five
and
five
years
old

when
his
wiser
brother
spoke

as
he
was
told

i
found
the

said
their
mother

tell

yours
severely
letter
of
a
five
year
once
more
she
dipped
her
pen
in
ink
and
wrote
i
love
you
dearly
and
now
she
said
and
stopped
to
think
i
put
a
lack
of
attention
she
had
folded
her
hands
and
had
never
stirred
nor
even
spoken
one
little
word
in
fact
she
was
good
as
good
could
be
while
the
grown
folks
talked
and
sipped
their
tea
at
last
a
small
voice
from
the
corner
we
heard
nobody
pays
any
pension
to
me
i
ought
to
must
the
chair
was
so
near
and
the
shelf
was
so
low
and
i
opened
the
door
just
in
time
to
see
the
last
of
the
coveted
caramels
go
while
a
look
imploring
was
cast
on
me
i
ought
to
must
i
know
the
chair
was
so
near
and
the
shelf
was
so
low
to
punish
alas
no
courage
i
had
and
i
did
as
perhaps
you
yourself
might
do
i
kissed
her
right
there
so
sweet
and
so
bad
but
i
ought
to
must
i
knew
a
vain
regret
he
was
six
years
old
just
six
that
day
and
i
saw
he
had
something
important
to
say
as
he
held
in
his
hand
a
broken
toy
he
looked
in
my
face
for
an
instant
and
then
he
said
with
a
sigh
and
a
downcast
eye
if
i
could
live
my
life
over
again
i
think
i
could
be
a
better
boy
in
the
dark
little
flat
at
the
end
of
the
court
what
can
the
children
in
cities
do
the
children
shut
in
from
wholesome
sport
the
children
that
live
all
winter
through
in
the
dark
little
flat
at
the
end
of
the
court
yet
a
comfort
they
have
and
a
beautiful
one
though
the
days
are
chill
and
the
days
are
short
at
noon
for
a
moment
looks
in
the
sun
in
the
dark
little
flat
at
the
end
of
the
court
then
the
dazzled
baby
drops
his
toy
down
tumbles
the
tottering
fort
sunshine
they
all
cry
out
in
their
joy
in
the
dark
little
flat
at
the
end
of
the
court
the
little
girl
from
town
us
children
liked
her
though
she
was
so
queer
when
she
came
out
to
pleasantville
last
year
she
must
walk
upon
the
grass
she
said
we
asked
her
and
she
just
shook
her
head
oh
yes
us
children
liked
the
little
kid
although
she
did
know
one
thing
did
and
said
the
oddest
things
you
ever
heard
she
saw
a
goose
and
asked
kind
o
bird
us
children
liked
the
little
kid
oh
yes
she
a
bit
afraid
to
tear
her
dress
one
day
when
she
went
barefoot
just
like
us
she
got
a
but
she
did
oh
yes
us
children
liked
her
but
oh
my
we
had
to
teach
her
how
to
play
high
spy
she
came
to
see
us
called
our
house
i
wonder
now
what
she
mean
by
that
for
every
day
a
flower
for
every
day
that
slips
the
sheath
of
jealous
night
in
may
the
violet
at
our
feet
the
lilac
honeyed
bough
the
frail
and
sweet
the
now
each
keeps
its
promise
as
love
keeps
its
vow
a
flower
for
every
day
in
flowerful
may
a
song
for
every
day
that
breaks
in
music
from
the
heart
of
may
the
warbler
mid
new
leaves
the
lark
in
fields
remote
the
housewren
at
our
eaves
the
oriole
haunting
note
when
orchard
blooms
down
fitful
zephyrs
float
a
song
for
every
day
in
songful
may
a
joy
for
every
day
that
stirs
the
heart
to
count
its
joys
in
may
now
fear
and
doubt
take
flight
borne
down
the
season
stream
grief
grows
a
shape
of
light
and
melts
a
tender
dream
now
but
to
be
alive
is
boon
supreme
a
joy
for
every
day
in
joyful
may
be
thanks
for
every
day
that
from
thy
heaven
thou
dost
send
in
may
my
morn
an
anthem
wake
my
noon
sweet
incense
bear
of
labor
for
thy
sake
my
evening
breath
a
prayer
for
bloom
for
song
for
joy
shed
everywhere
be
thanks
to
thee
each
day
in
thankful
may
the
there
a
strange
and
sweet
softly
hovering
in
the
air
now
it
stays
the
restless
feet
now
it
smoothes
the
wayward
hair
now
it
droops
the
curly
head
propped
upon
the
parts
the
lips
of
rosebud
red
while
the
eyes
with
fancies
fill
sunbeams
from
the
summer
sky
kiss
the
arm
so
round
and
bare
there
a
sweet
and
shy
softly
hovering
in
the
air
is
that
dream
of
field
or
wood
mossy
bank
or
violet
dell
thrush
nest
with
downy
brood
lately
prisoned
in
the
shell
comes
that
dream
from
fairyland
blown
about
in
wondrous
ways
like
a
skein
of
gossamer
fanned
by
a
troop
of
laughing
fays
or
upon
some
elfin
brook
wing
of
for
sail
passing
many
a
wildflower
nook
did
it
drift
so
light
and
frail
little
dreamer
if
i
dared
i
would
say
your
tell
but
it
never
can
be
shared
and
one
word
would
break
its
spell
born
deaf
dumb
and
blind
an
a
hand
once
took
my
own
that
touch
i
never
shall
forget
a
strange
voice
spoke
so
strange
a
tone
mine
ear
had
never
met
it
said
come
see
my
garden
come
the
fingers
closer
twined
the
voice
of
one
born
deaf
and
dumb
the
touch
of
one
born
blind
they
thrilled
me
so
the
tears
came
fast
but
in
glad
haste
she
led
the
way
through
hall
and
open
door
we
passed
into
a
garden
gay
her
share
was
but
a
little
space
it
bloomed
with
pansies
dark
and
bright
and
each
looked
up
with
elfin
grace
as
though
to
win
her
sight
she
smiled
the
smiled
through
tears
or
was
it
morning
dew
down
knelt
the
deaf
and
dumb
blind
child
i
do
give
all
to
you
i
could
not
stay
those
fingers
swift
she
plucked
me
all
the
flowers
she
had
i
never
shall
have
any
gift
so
sweet
as
this
so
sad
the
forgotten
in
a
chamber
lone
the
hooded
cradle
brown
and
old
began
to
rock
began
to
moan
where
are
the
babes
i
used
to
hold
to
men
and
women
they
are
grown
and
through
the
world
their
way
must
make
the
cradle
rocked
and
made
its
moan
my
babes
no
single
step
could
take
a
helmsman
one
on
wide
seas
blown
his
sinewy
hands
the
wheel
employs
the
cradle
rocked
and
made
its
moan
my
babes
could
scarcely
grasp
their
toys
and
one
with
words
of
winning
tone
god
shepherd
goes
the
lost
to
seek
the
cradle
rocked
and
still
made
moan
the
babes
i
held
no
word
could
speak
and
one
with
children
of
her
own
her
life
is
toil
and
love
and
prayer
the
cradle
rocked
and
still
made
moan
my
babes
of
babes
could
take
no
care
now
all
that
once
were
mine
are
flown
but
one
that
still
with
me
shall
bide
the
cradle
ceased
to
rock
to
moan
the
sweetest
one
the
babe
who
died
some
ladies
of
the
olden
time
a
long
time
ago
in
childhood
land
a
troop
of
sweet
ladies
i
knew
if
the
truth
must
be
told
i
myself
was
their
lady
maid
patient
and
true
i
served
them
i
dressed
them
i
took
them
to
walk
i
made
the
fine
clothes
that
they
wore
very
dainty
and
delicate
too
were
they
all
for
they
never
arose
until
four
wide
were
their
flounces
of
crimson
or
white
a
little
old
fashioned
for
now
prim
were
their
figures
ah
yes
i
must
own
their
heads
they
never
could
bow
their
heads
were
so
round
and
so
small
and
so
green
not
clever
nor
learnèd
were
they
but
then
they
were
only
four
ladies
and
their
life
was
a
short
one
and
gay
a
water
lily
did
i
behold
the
lady
of
the
lake
part
the
cool
water
with
a
slender
hand
and
brought
she
for
her
loved
knight
errant
sake
out
of
some
liquid
crypt
the
magic
brand
i
dreamed
it
was
the
lady
of
the
lake
i
did
but
dream
again
i
looked
and
knew
the
water
lily
white
as
winter
flake
but
with
a
heart
all
gold
and
fragrant
dew
the
kinderbank
the
little
mothers
it
was
a
day
in
warm
july
it
was
a
far
countree
the
bees
were
humming
in
the
flowers
that
filled
the
linden
tree
the
linden
made
a
cooling
shade
for
many
a
yard
around
and
flecks
of
sunlight
here
and
there
did
dot
the
shady
ground
a
long
low
easy
seat
there
was
beneath
the
linden
green
and
across
the
back
in
letters
large
was
seen
i
did
not
need
that
word
to
read
to
know
the
children
seat
for
there
the
grass
was
trodden
down
by
many
little
feet
upon
this
day
the
was
full
as
it
could
be
with
children
sitting
in
a
row
a
pleasant
sight
to
see
each
little
woman
bent
her
head
too
busy
far
to
speak
each
had
a
lock
of
yellow
hair
slipped
down
across
her
cheek
each
little
woman
pursed
her
lips
into
a
rosebud
small
and
never
knew
how
fast
time
flew
so
busy
were
they
all
one
made
the
click
with
shining
head
bent
low
and
earnest
eyes
intent
to
see
the
winter
stocking
grow
another
toiling
at
a
seam
the
thread
drew
in
and
out
and
once
she
sighed
so
hard
she
tried
to
make
the
stitches
stout
but
ever
as
they
worked
away
and
would
not
look
around
they
watched
the
little
ones
that
played
before
them
on
the
ground
the
little
ones
they
laughed
and
cooed
and
talked
their
their
feet
so
bare
were
for
only
one
could
walk
his
flaxen
hair
in
ringlets
stood
upon
his
serious
head
his
eyes
so
blue
were
serious
too
and
drawing
near
i
said
whose
precious
baby
boy
is
this
so
thoughtful
and
so
sweet
then
up
and
spoke
a
little
maid
of
those
upon
the
seat
this
baby
he
belongs
to
me
he
goes
just
where
i
go
and
i
his
little
mother
yes
mother
told
me
so
she
said
that
he
was
mine
day
and
so
it
must
be
true
i
brushed
his
hair
i
take
good
care
as
she
herself
would
do
and
i
quite
sure
that
i
can
cure
and
drive
the
pain
away
with
kisses
if
my
baby
hurts
his
little
hand
at
play
and
whose
are
all
these
babies
here
why
we
oh
do
you
know
we
all
are
little
mothers
yes
mothers
told
us
so
the
little
mothers
all
looked
up
and
each
did
nod
her
head
our
mothers
told
us
so
ah
then
is
true
indeed
i
said
i
left
them
as
i
found
them
there
beneath
the
linden
tree
and
often
since
that
day
i
thought
i
like
to
go
and
see
if
still
the
little
mothers
sit
upon
the
children
seat
and
watch
their
babies
as
they
play
and
tumble
at
their
feet
in

the
children
seat
buonamico
legend
of
i
when
monte
morello
is
capped
with
snow
and
the
wind
from
the
north
comes
whistling
down
it
is
chill
to
rise
with
the
morning
star
in
the
city
of
flowers
in
florence
town
ii
light
is
the
sleep
of
the
old
for
they
know
how
brief
are
their
few
remaining
days
but
when
hearts
are
young
sleep
lingers
long
and
too
sweet
to
leave
are
the
dreamful
ways
iii
so
tafi
the
master
awoke
with
the
light
but
the
prentice
lad
buonamico
was
young
and
his
dreaming
ears
were
loath
to
hear
the
daybreak
bell
awakening
tongue
iv
for
it
seemed
to
speak
with
old
tafi
voice
colors
to
grind
and
the
shop
to
be
swept
then
out
of
his
bed
on
the
bare
stone
floor
poor
buonamico
shivering
crept
v
busy
all
day
with
his
quick
young
hands
busy
his
thoughts
with
a
project
bold
the
master
will
find
he
said
to
himself
is
not
well
to
work
in
the
dark
and
the
cold
vi
but
the
master
unheeding
the
prentice
lad
matched
the
mosaics
fine
and
quaint
till
his
tablets
of
stone
revealed
the
forms
of
mother
and
child
of
cherub
and
saint
vii
buonamico
meanwhile
forsook
his
tasks
and
prying
in
crevice
of
wall
or
ground
with
a
patience
and
skill
boys
only
know
thirty
great
beetles
the
truant
found
viii
as
many
wax
tapers
then
he
took
thirty
small
tapers
nor
less
nor
more
and
presto
each
beetle
clumsy
and
slow
on
its
broad
black
back
a
candle
bore
ix
next
morning
ere
dawn
when
tafi
awoke
ere
his
lips
could
frame
their
usual
call
a
sight
he
beheld
that
froze
his
veins
an
impish
procession
of
tapers
small
x
slowly
they
came
and
slowly
went
and
they
seemed
to
pass
through
a
crack
the
door
so
slowly
they
moved
he
counted
them
all
thirty
they
numbered
nor
less
nor
more
xi
surely
some
evil
these
hands
have
wrought
that
the
powers
of
darkness
invade
my
cell
and
many
an
the
master
said
to
reverse
and
undo
the
unholy
spell
xii
when
daylight
was
come
buonamico
he
told
a
good
lad
ever
thou
wert
and
indeed
wise
for
thy
years
and
therefore
speak
out
and
as
best
thou
canst
this
mystery
read
xiii
may
it
not
be
buonamico
said
the
powers
of
darkness
that
good
men
hate
are
vexed
with
my
master
who
falters
not
in
faithful
service
early
and
late
xiv
ay
that
they
are
said
the
master
no
doubt
said
the
time
is
night
and
it
be
they
like
not
this
wondrous
work
which
thou
risest
to
do
ere
peep
of
light
xv
well
hast
thou
counseled
the
master
replied
so
young
of
years
so
sage
in
thy
thought
i
will
rise
no
more
ere
the
day
hath
dawned
a
work
of
light
should
in
light
be
wrought
xvi
thus
runs
the
legend
which
also
saith
spite
of
his
pranks
buonamico
became
when
the
years
were
fled
and
tafi
was
gone
a
painter
who
rivaled
his
master
fame
the
prince
and
the
upon
a
day
of
olden
days
a
royal
lad
at
school
in
mischief
apt
with
many
a
prank

the
good

but

take
the
blows
he
had
not
earned

to
smite
and
suddenly
his
princely
soul
revolted
at
the
sight
the
shame
the
shame
the
tingling
shame
no
blood
of
kings
could
brook
forward
he
sprung
the
falling
rod
in
his
own
hand
he
took
mine
is
the
blame
be
mine
the
shame
for
what
i
only
wrought
let
none
but
me
endure
the
pain
my
deed
alone
has
brought
thus
on
a
day
of
days
it
chanced
a
royal
schoolboy
learned
that
noble
hearts
in
every
age
a
coward
shield
have
spurned
master
corvus
in
rome
beside
the
forum
a
cobbler
had
his
shop
where
on
his
way
to
school
the
schoolboy
loved
to
stop
the
sheets
of
leather
hung
all
about
the
wall
the
cobbler
stitched
and
scolded
bent
over
last
and
awl
was
not
the
cobbler
scolding
at
which
the
schoolboys
laughed
nor
did
they
care
to
watch
his
cunning
handicraft
it
was
a
dapper
person
with
coat
as
black
as
night
that
offered
to
the
schoolboy
an
delight
a
droll
yet
silent
person
good
morrow
all
his
speech
he
stood
upon
a
rostrum
as
though
to
teach
or
preach
it
was
the
cobbler
raven
good
morrow
clear
and
loud
he
called
with
mimic
laughter
that
charmed
the
truant
crowd
until
at
last
reminded
of
school
and
pedagogue
of
lecture
and
of
ferrule
to
point
his
apologue
and
now
would
master
corvus
to
while
the
time
away
look
to
see
what
mischief
he
might
devise
alas
the
raven
cunning
no
bound
nor
measure
knew
alas
the
cobbler
temper
it
never
better
grew
and
when
his
choicest
leather
embossed
with
claw
and
beak
he
saw
upon
the
raven
swift
vengeance
he
did
wreak
which
done
morose
and
sullen
he
sat
him
down
once
more
nor
scolded
when
the
schoolboys
called
through
the
open
door
good
morrow
master
corvus
no
shrill
and
joyous
croak
responded
from
within
and
then
their
anger
broke
how
daredst
thou
kill
the
raven
the
better
man
of
two
they
seized
and
beat
the
cobbler
till
he
for
life
did
sue
then
took
they
master
corvus
from
where
he
lifeless
lay
their
dear
and
droll
companion
and
carried
him
away
said
one
there
is
a
duty
which
to
our
friend
we
owe
in
life
we
gave
him
honor
and
honor
still
we
show
that
will
we
cried
they
warmly
young
romans
long
ago
in
life
we
gave
him
honor
and
honor
still
we
show
next
day
along
the
forum
with
slow
and
measured
tread
defiled
the
long
cortège
of
master
corvus
dead
his
bier
was
heaped
with
garlands
a
piper
went
before
and
as
they
had
been
kinsmen
two
blacks
the
casket
bore
then
down
the
via
sacra
the
sad
procession
moved
while
at
their
doors
and
windows
the
people
all
approved
and
thus
to
master
corvus
full
rites
his
friends
did
pay
and
buried
him
is
said
beside
the
appian
way
with
lightly
sprinkled
earth
above
his
glossy
breast
with
stone
and
due
inscription
and
the
rest
abbott
tradition
of
westminster
is
a
saying
that
stolen
sweets
are
sweeter
and
so
with
my
hero
it
was
i
think
abbott
if
philip
or
paul
or
peter
never
be
known
there
a
missing
link
the
legend
declares
without
praise
or
censure
a
youth
had
been
challenged
to
sleep
all
night
in
the
gray
old
abbey
a
madcap
adventure
but
madcap
adventures
were
his
delight
in
the
chapel
of
kings
in
westminster
abbey
you
may
see
the
stone
that
was
brought
from
scone
and
above
it
the
armchair
old
and
shabby
where
every
king
has
had
his
throne
monarchs
in
marble
greater
or
lesser
and
at
least
three
queens
of
the
english
land
in
a
circle
they
lie
round
the
good
confessor
crown
on
the
head
and
scepter
in
hand
gone
from
his
tomb
are
the
wondrous
riches
it
once
did
hold
both
of
gems
and
gold
but
you
still
may
see
the
gothic
niches
where
the
sick
awaited
the
cure
of
old
beggar
or
lord
poor
drudge
or
duchess
alike
might
they
hope
for
the
good
saint
aid
and
they
left
their
jewels
or
dropped
their
crutches
as
token
that
not
in
vain
had
they
prayed
was
edward
day
and
the
throng
gladhearted
with
the
blessing
of
peace
had
gone
its
way
the
last
red
beam
of
the
sun
had
departed
and
twilight
spread
through
the
chapel
gray
and
the
marble
kings
on
their
marble
couches
once
more
they
are
lying
in
state
alone
save
for
a
nimble
shadow
that
crouches
behind
the
stone
that
was
brought
from
scone
and
the
aged
verger
was
never
the
wiser
as
he
passed
that
stone
and
the
oaken
chair
though
watchful
was
he
as
watchful
miser
he
never
discovered
my
hero
was
there
when
the
keys
at
his
leather
girdle
jingled
how
loud
did
they
sound
in
young
abbott
ear
and
when
they
were
still
how
the
silence
tingled
how
dim
was
the
light
yet
why
should
he
fear
the
night
was
before
him
the
shadows
were
dreary
as
forth
from
his
he
crept
there
was
nothing
to
do
his
eyelids
grew
weary
and
into
the
chair
he
crept
and
slept
never
before
and
nevermore
since
then
hath
any
but
royalty
sat
in
that
chair
but
my
hero
himself
i
hold
was
a
prince
then
of
the
realm
of
youth
and
of
dreams
most
fair
but
with
the
dawn
his
slumbers
were
broken
and
rubbing
his
eyes
he
sat
bolt
upright
folly
he
cried
if
i
left
no
token
to
prove
that
i
stayed
in
the
abbey
all
night
so
he
carved
his
name
and
carved
it
quaintly
as
pleased
him
best
on
that
ancient
seat
and
the
sculptured
kings
in
the
dawn
smiled
faintly
but
never
a
one
forbade
the
feat
then
somehow
and
somewhere
discreetly
he
flitted
and
when
the
old
verger
returned
for
the
day
i
warrant
he
muttered
with
bent
brows
knitted
something
uncanny
hath
passed
this
way
with
the
record
of
kings
and
of
statesmen
and
sages
this
of
a
mischievous
youth
is
shown
abbott
a
name
that
has
lasted
for
ages
nicked
on
the
seat
of
that
oaken
throne
the
giant
daughter
my
story
of
the
olden
day
beside
the
hurrying
blue
rhine
water
my
story
of
a
runaway
the
giant
niedeck
little
daughter
she
wanders
at
her
own
sweet
will
her
flaxen
ringlets
wide
she
tosses
a
dozen
steps
she
climbs
the
hill
a
dozen
more
a
vineyard
crosses
the
pine
trees
young
aside
are
brushed
as
though
they
were
but
nodding
grasses
she
laughs
aloud
the
birds
are
hushed
and
hide
away
until
she
passes
she
heeds
them
not
the
giant
mite
so
bent
upon
her
own
wild
pleasure
and
now
she
sees
a
wondrous
sight
a
curious
thing
for
her
to
treasure
oh
what
a
lovely
toy
i
found
she
clapped
her
hands
in
childish
wonder
the
great
trees
trembled
miles
around
the
rocks
gave
back
a
sound
like
thunder
a
plowman
with
his
horse
the
toy
a
plowman
at
his
daily
drudging
she
snatched
them
up
with
eager
joy
and
home
the
giant
child
went
trudging
she
reached
the
castle
out
of
breath
and
from
her
pocket
says
my
fable
she
drew
the
ploughman
scared
to
death
and
laid
him
swooning
on
the
table
and
then
away
in
haste
she
sped
to
bring
her
nurse
and
lady
mother
now
burn
my
wooden
dolls
she
said
live
toys
are
best
i
have
no
other
the
giant
lady
fair
and
mild
thus
spake
unto
her
little
daughter
go
take
the
plowman
back
my
child
to
fields
beside
the
blue
rhine
water
though
weak
and
small
his
heart
is
great
and
liebchen
if
we
kept
him
here
all
day
beside
his
cottage
gate
would
weep
for
him
his
children
dear
then
back
the
giant
child
did
go
and
left
the
plowman
where
she
found
him
and
when
the
sun
was
sinking
low
he
started
up
and
looked
around
him
i
must
have
dreamed
he
laughed
outright
as
when
some
sudden
fancy
pleases
and
i
will
tell
my
dream
when
gretchen
for
a
story
teases
erotion
and
the
dove
i
was
too
young
they
said
i
was
not
seven
but
i
would
understand
as
i
grew
older
why
the
white
dove
that
died
was
not
in
heaven
but
they
were
wrong
for
when
i
came
to
heaven
when
first
i
came
and
all
was
strange
and
lonely
my
pretty
pet
flew
straight
upon
my
shoulder
and
there
she
stays
all
day
at
evening
only
between
my
hands
close
to
my
breast
i
fold
her
the
homesick
soldier
the
soldier
woke
at
the
quail
first
note
at
dawn
on
the
grassy
couch
where
he
lay
o
bird
that
calls
from
the
fields
of
home
what
do
my
darlings
so
far
away
they
are
up
and
ready
to
roam
they
scatter
the
dew
with
their
small
bare
feet
and
laugh
as
they
wade
through
the
meadow
sweet
the
soldier
paused
on
the
dusty
march
and
stooped
by
the
cooling
stream
to
drink
o
river
that
runs
through
the
fields
of
home
what
do
my
dear
ones
who
dwell
on
thy
brink
farther
and
farther
they
roam
they
are
sending
their
mimic
fleets
adrift
and
they
follow
them
borne
on
my
current
swift
the
soldier
sank
on
the
twilight
sward
and
the
vigilant
lights
were
thronging
above
o
stars
that
shine
on
the
fields
of
home
what
do
they
now
whom
most
i
love
they
have
ceased
to
roam
to
roam
and
are
lisping
a
prayer
at
their
mother
knee
and
that
prayer
and
her
tears
are
for
thee
for
thee
the
cossack
mother
my
little
one
will
die
then
break
my
heart
oh
break
but
not
be
a
lonely
flight
her
tender
soul
shall
take
for
there
where
smoky
clouds
are
spread
that
blot
the
sunset
sky
are
many
dying
many
dead
and
others
yet
to
die
my
child
loved
soldiers
so
and
they
they
passed
this
door
would
toss
her
in
their
arms
in
play
and
laugh
when
she
cried
more
so
when
she
passes
hence
they
too
the
brave
the
strong
as
up
they
climb
the
heavenly
height
will
bear
her
soul
along
with
spirit
lances
shining
clear
they
reach
god
citadel
my
little
one
will
have
no
fear
with
friends
she
loves
so
well
the
the
flowers
the
haunted
flowers
of
may
they
bring
delight
they
bring
heartache
what
wondrous
things
to
me
they
say
so
bright
so
dim
so
sad
so
gay
no
stem
of
theirs
i
dare
to
break
the
flowers
the
haunted
flowers
of
may
when
lip
to
lip
they
softly
lay
as
soft
as
still
as
flake
on
flake
what
wondrous
things
to
me
they
say
for
lo
there
comes
with
them
to
play
a
child
whose
feet
no
imprint
make
the
flowers
the
haunted
flowers
of
may
from
childhood
land
they
take
their
way
they
bloom
but
for
that
sake
what
wondrous
things
to
me
they
say
with
them
it
lives
their
little
day
with
them
each
year
wake
the
flowers
the
haunted
flowers
of
may
what
wondrous
things
to
me
they
say
the
clock
of
the
year
is
the
curfew
of
the
year
when
falls
and
fades
the
maple
leafy
fire
is
midnight
of
the
year
when
streams
beneath
a
fretted
roof
retire
it
is
the
small
hours
of
the
year
when
none
of
all
that
sleep
will
wake
the
legion
storms
of
heaven
their
deep
and
hidden
fastness
shake
it
is
the
dark
hour
ere
the
dawn
when
through
the
growing
rifts
of
sleep
the
and
moaning
dreams
of
other
days
begin
to
peep
but
when
amid
the
softening
rain
aloft
so
mellow
and
so
clear
the
first
flute
of
the
robin
sounds
it
is
the
daybreak
of
the
year

day

toiler
gone
afield
and
to

awake

how
glad

shining
after

the
garden
gleamed
and
glistened
i
heard
a
humblebee
complain
i
bent
me
down
and
listened
around
a
nodding
stalk
he
flew
that
bore
white
lilies
seven
and
five
were
opened
wide
and
two
slept
in
their
lily
heaven
the
foolish
bee
the
grumbling
bee
that
might
have
found
a
palace
as
any
one
beside
could
see
within
the
honeyed
chalice
the
grumbling
bee
the
foolish
bee
still
hummed
one
note
of
sorrow
oh
that
would
give
to
me
the
blossoms
of
from
bud
to
bud
the
livelong
hour
i
saw
him
pass
and
hover
and
pry
about
each
flower
some
entrance
to
discover
a
discontented
mind
no
doubt
a
moral
here

borrow
i
only
say
do

about
the
blossoms
of

a

finding

a
pleasant
dream
the
brook
and
the

i
listened
to
a
summer
brook
that
rippled
past
my
shady
seat
now
far
now
near
now
vague
now
clear
the
music
of
its
liquid
feet
few
tones
the
slender
rillet
has
has
that
few
how
sweet
how
soothing
sweet
a
live
delight
by
day
by
night
the
music
of
its
liquid
feet
while
there
i
mused
a
songbird
lit
and
swung
above
my
shady
seat
he
heard
the
brook
and
straightway
took
the
music
of
its
liquid
feet
a
bird
bright
glance
on
me
he
bent
a
bird
glance
fearless
yet
discreet
as
who
might
say
this
roundelay
of
liquid
joy
i
can
repeat
the
mimic
carol
done
once
more
he
needs
must
try
its
measures
sweet
again
again
that
rippling
strain
my
songbird
did
repeat
repeat
since
then
i
learned
that
human
breasts
to
few
and
simple
measures
beat
o
blessed
bird
my
word
i
too
repeat
repeat
repeat
the
birds
of
soleure
thrifty
the
folk
in
the
town
of
soleure
and
they
steadily
ply
their
fathers
trade
proud
are
they
too
that
year
after
year
the
watches
and
clocks
of
the
world
they
have
made
click
go
the
seconds
kling
go
the
hours
in
the
town
of
soleure
the
time
is
well
kept
ever
new
steel
they
cut
and
trim
while
into
the
street
the
filings
are
swept
only
waste
metal
unfit
for
use
but
it
catches
the
sunshine
and
glitters
still
and
what
are
those
thrushes
doing
there
each
with
a
scrap
of
steel
in
its
bill
the
watchmaker
boy
has
paused
with
his
broom
and
he
follows
the
birds
with
a
boy
keen
eye
their
secret
he
learns
and
whither
they
go
in
the
leafy
tent
of
yon
linden
high
their
secret
he
guards
the
springtime
through
and
he
smiles
when
he
hears
the
young
ones
call
never
had
birdlings
a
cradle
like
theirs
surely
to
them
can
no
harm
befall
when
the
leaves
are
flying
and
birds
are
flown
is
out
on
the
linden
bough
he
swings
the
fearless
lad
that
he
is
and
thence
a
wonderful
nest
of
steel
he
brings
it
yet
may
be
seen
in
the
town
of
soleure
to
show
how
the
skill
of
the
birds
began
at
the
point
where
human
skill
fell
short
for
they
used
what
was
waste
in
the
hands
of
man
the
prairie
nest
where
think
you
a
little
gray
finch
in
the
far
wide
west
chose
of
all
places
to
build
and
to
brood
her
nest
well
i
will
tell
you
the
tale
that
the
hunter
told
strange
things
has
he
seen
this
hunter
grizzled
and
old
he
spoke
of
the
cattle
that
came
to
no
herder
call
roaming
the
fenceless
prairie
from
springtime
to
fall
a
shot
from
his
rifle
laid
low
the
king
of
the
herd
when
hark
the
sharp
cry
of
a
circling
and
hovering
bird
what
did
it
mean
the
hunter
drew
in
his
rein
and
leaped
to
the
ground
where
dead
lay
the
lord
of
the
plain
stilled
was
the
beating
heart
and
glazed
were
the
eyes
the
fluttering
bird
circled
higher
and
sharper
her
cries
while
finer
and
fainter
yet
many
and
all
as
keen
came
cries
from
below
as
in
answer
what
could
it
mean
the
hunter
bent
down
and
his
heart
with
wonder
was
stirred
when
he
saw
between
the
wide
horns
the
nest
of
a
bird
like
a
crown
which
the
prairie
monarch
might
choose
to
wear
on
his
shaggy
forelock
and
lined
with
the
friendly
hair
the
hunter
stood
still
abashed
in
the
midst
of
the
plain
to
hear
the
little
gray
mother
cry
of
pain
and
the
faint
fine
voices
of
nestlings
answer
the
cry
while
their
fearless
friend
lay
dead
between
earth
and
sky
the
moving
of
the
nest
do
not
ask
me
or
all
in
fairyland
it
chanced
as
the
leaves
upon
the
bough
in
the
autumn
breezes
danced
said
the
thrush
unto
his
mate
we
must
soon
be
gone
from
here
no
one
else
would
stay
so
late
do
not
ask
me
or
but
his
mate
did
sorely
grieve
my
dear
nest
upon
this
bough
it
will
break
my
heart
to
leave
do
not
ask
me
or
but
the
thrush
children
too
perched
around
began
to
cry
oh
whatever
shall
we
do
never
such
a
nest
as
ours
we
would
rather
have
it
than
bermuda
and
the
flowers
pleaded
then
the
thrush
mate
let
us
take
the
nest
my
dear
it
is
light
and
we
are
eight
do
not
ask
me
or
but
the
thrushes
with
a
cheer
took
that
nest
from
off
the
bough
firmly
now
with
beak
and
claw
spread
your
wings
and
never
fear
to
push
and
to
draw
so
the
thrushes
took
their
nest
every
one
his
strength
applied
but
the
youngest
was
thought
best
should
be
snugly
tucked
inside
all
in
fairyland
it
chanced
there
is
nothing
more
to
say
ere
the
morn
was
far
advanced
they
were
miles
and
miles
away
the
widowed
eagle
out
from
the
aërie
beloved
we
flew
now
through
the
white
and
now
through
the
blue
glided
beneath
us
hilltop
and
glen
river
and
meadow
and
dwellings
of
men
we
flew
we
flew
through
the
regions
of
light
and
the
wind
wild
pæan
followed
our
flight
free
of
the
world
we
flew
we
flew
bound
to
each
other
alone
we
two
to
the
shivering
migrant
we
called
adieu
mid
the
weather
we
flew
we
flew
till
hark
from
below
the
hiss
of
lead
and
one
of
us
dropped
as
a
plume
is
shed
around
and
around
i
flew
i
flew
wheeling
my
flight
ever
closer
i
drew
there
on
the
earth
my
belovèd
lay
with
a
crimson
stain
on
her
gray
and
creatures
of
earth
we
had
scorned
before
now
measured
the
wings
that
would
lift
no
more
and
i
stooped
as
an
arrow
is
shot
from
the
height
and
sought
to
bear
her
away
in
my
flight
flight
away
to
our
aërie
far
to
seek
well
did
i
fight
with
talons
and
beak
but
the
craven
foe
in
their
numbers
and
might
bore
her
in
triumph
out
of
my
sight
the
chickadee
madcap
never
tired
of
play
what
the
news
winter
coming
up
this
way
and
the
winter
comes
to
stay
madcap
whither
will
you
go
now
the
blow
in
the
pine
boughs
thick
and
low
we
are
sheltered
from
the
snow
madcap
in
the
snow
and
sleet
what
have
you
to
eat
seeds
and
berries
are
a
treat
when
the
frost
has
made
them
sweet
madcap
other
birds
have
flown
to
a
summer
zone
when
they
gone
we
own
our
white
playground
all
alone
the
and
her
children
her
children
all
were
gathered
round
her
one
olden
golden
day
between
her
tender
drooping
eyelids
she
watched
them
feed
or
play
upon
the
lion
living
velvet
she
pillowed
her
fair
head
a
white
fawn
pushed
its
dewy
muzzle
beneath
the
hand
that
fed
a
goldfinch
clung
upon
a
ringlet
that
brushed
her
wide
smooth
brow
and
thence
right
merrily
he
answered
his
comrades
on
the
bough
but
at
her
feet
there
lay
a
sleeper
of
limb
whose
motion
force
and
will
to
be
kept
yet
their
prison
dim
and
round
about
his
couch
of
slumber

rest

space
did
make
your
peace

mother
told
her
children

broken
if
he

lo
this
the
best
of
all
created
shall
yet
an
evil
bring
and
ye
in

shall
graze
the
pasture
and
ye
in
fear
shall
sing
for
your
dear
sake
my
lesser
children
i
keep
him
long
asleep

on
a
happy
season
his
dreams
be
passing
deep
thus
while
her
children
gathered
round
her
and
while
man
sleeping
lay
the
fair
softly
murmured
it
is
your
golden
day
when
the

are
gone
when

of

skilled
in

spent
in
hunting
that
there
might

rat
they
hired
to
delve
in
darkness
underground
till
he
the
precious
charter
found
and
brought
the
horse
and
ox
who
thought
their
liberty
could
thus
be
bought
the
tiresome
creatures
to
this
day
they
drudge
and
drudge
the
same
old
way
the
ox
the
ass
the
horse
these
all
divided
with
the
rat
their
stall
and
from
their
mangers
grain
they
gave
such
price
they
paid
the
thievish
knave
what
loss
was
ours
we
scarce
can
know
the
charter
we
could
never
show
i
might
have
had
a
dais
spread
with
crimson
velvet
and
been
fed
on
golden
finches
every
day
but
as
for
he
naught
to
say
he
lost
the
charter
of
our
rights
when
flogged
or
chained
on
moonlight
nights
upon
one
subject
only
we
can
always
heartily
agree
waving
her
you
careless
dogs
we
careful
cats
our
common
enemy
bounce
yes
rats
embracing
opportunity
to
reinstate
old
servant
up
ah
who
said
rats
just
now
and
where
and
why
can
not
you
two
play
fair
this
tip
is
seen
to
be
occupying
her
own
corner
of
the
hearth
and
bounce
to
be
sound
asleep
his
nose
deeply
buried
between
his
forepaws
old
servant
rubs
her
eyes
then
smiles
thoughtfully
and
settles
back
in
the
saving
of
jack
east
side
whose
dog
is
jack
he
belongs
to
this
street
needs
has
too
much
to
eat
houseless
and
homeless
well
i
guess
not
in
the
whole
of
this
block
there
is
a
tot
but
has
had
jack
home
to
board
and
to
sleep
and
he
pays
in
fun
every
cent
of
his
keep
he
the
dog
and
the
smartest
too
no
end
of
the
tricks
we
taught
him
to
do
got
a
heap
of
sense
in
his
yellow
hide
he
the
dog
on
the
whole
east
side
why
even
the
does
know
what
breed
jack
is
for
he
told
me
so
the
came
every
day
but
jack
knew
their
cart
and
he
hide
away
then
out
he
come
laughing
when
they
got
past
ca
how
he
ever
was
cotched
at
last
but
he
was
and
they
boosted
him
into
their
cart
and
nobody
there
could
take
his
part
my
but
the
little
kids
cried
like
mad
and
us
bigger
ones
too
we
felt
just
as
bad
for
he
rode
us
all
on
his
old
yellow
back
it
looked
as
though
it
was
all
up
with
jack
and
i
watched
him
go
but
he
cocked
one
eye
as
much
as
to
say
i
be
back
by
and
by
the
look
that
he
gave
me
it
made
me
and
i
thought
of
a
plan
as
quick
as
wink
and
i
says
ladies
and
gents
i
guess
that
we
each
of
us
got
a
few
cents
and
we
club
together
and
have
a
show
and
charge
a
price
not
high
nor
low
and
we
raise
the
money
right
here
and
now
that
buy
jack
back
by
that
how
tony
the
eyetalian
boy
he
sing
and
patsy
mcgovern
do
his
handspring
and
ikey
aarons
swallow
his
knife
and
make
us
all
think
he
taking
his
life
and
little
freda
she
pass
round
the
hat
she
smile
and
say
nothing
she
just
good
for
that
well
we
emptied
our
pockets
you
bet
we
did
every
one
of
us
big
and
each
little
kid
ran
home
for
their
banks
as
fast
as
they
could
and
we
raised
the
money
and
all
felt
good
and
next
day
early
we
brought
jack
back
so
now
things
run
in
the
same
old
track
but
he
got
his
license
and
have
to
and
we
bought
him
a
collar
skye
of
skye
skye
of
skye
when
the
night
was
late
and
the
burly
porter
drowsy
grew
ran
down
to
the
silent
pier
to
wait
till
the
boat
came
in
with
its
hardy
crew
skye
of
skye
as
he
sat
on
the
pier
turned
seaward
ever
a
watchful
eye
and
his
shaggy
ears
were
pricked
to
hear
the
plash
of
oars
as
the
boat
drew
nigh
skye
of
skye
when
they
leaped
ashore
greeted
the
crew
with
a
joyful
cry
kissed
their
hands
and
trotted
before
to
the
inn
that
stood
on
the
hilltop
high
within
was
the
porter
sound
asleep
they
could
almost
hear
his
lusty
snore
then
skye
of
skye
with
an
antic
leap
would
pull
on
the
bellrope
that
swung
by
the
door
then
was
the
bolt
drawn
quickly
back
back
then
did
the
jolly
crew
stream
in
and
landlaird
bring
us
your
best
auld
sack
and
aweel
aweel
where
hae
ye
been
then
skye
of
skye
on
the
floor
sanded
that
day
by
the
housemaid
neat
lay
down
to
rest
him
his
vigils
with
his
honest
nose
between
his
feet
but
skye
of
skye
as
he
rolled
his
eye
on
the
friendly
crowd
heard
his
master
say
na
na
that
doggie
ye
couldna
buy
not
though
his
weight
in
gold
ye
would
pay
skye
of
skye
they
have
made
him
a
bed
on
the
cliff
by
the
ocean
swell
on
the
stone
they
have
reared
above
his
head
you
may
see
a
little
dog
ringing
a
bell
tip
kitten
the
master
he
loved
my
kitten
my
kitten
she
was
still
too
weak
to
stand
when
he
placed
her
upon
one
hand
and
over
it
laid
the
other
and
looked
at
me
kindly
and
said
tip
you
a
proud
little
mother
for
they
left
me
but
one
my
kitten
my
kitten
as
sweet
as
a
kitten
could
be
and
i
loved
her
for
all
the
three
they
had
taken
away
without
warning
i
watched
her
from
daylight
till
dark
watched
her
from
night
until
morning
i
never
left
my
kitten
my
kitten
for
i
feared
and
i
loved
her
so
till
i
thought
it
time
she
should
know
that
cats
in
the
house
have
a
duty
and
a
right
to
be
proud
of
their
skill
as
well
as
their
grace
and
their
beauty
i
only
left
my
kitten
my
kitten
a
few
short
moments
in
all
to
punish
the
mouse
in
the
wall
each
day
growing
bolder
and
bolder
and
i
brought
her
the
mouse
to
show
what
kittens
must
do
when
older
i
brought
her
the
mouse
my
kitten
my
kitten
i
tossed
it
i
caught
it
for
her
but
she
would
not
see
nor
stir
my
heart
it
beat
fast
and
faster
and
i
caught
her
up
in
my
mouth
and
carried
her
so
to
the
master
i
thought
he
would
help
my
kitten
my
kitten
and
i
laid
her
down
at
his
feet
never
a
kitten
so
sweet
and
he
knew
that
i
had
no
other
but
he
only
said
poor
tip
is
a
sad
day
for
you
little
mother
the
king
of
cats
i
the
wind
comes
down
the
chimney
with
a
sigh
the
kettle
sings
from
grimy
hook
while
ticks
the
clock
unseen
on
mantel
high
the
black
cat
holds
the
cosiest
straight
in
the
blaze
his
eyeballs
look
and
children
four
do
pay
him
flattering
court
the
baby
brings
to
him
its
and
shows
the
way
to
build
a
castled
fort
the
black
cat
shares
indeed
their
every
thought
and
sport
ii
the
black
cat
came
to
us
a
twelvemonth
since
the
black
cat
is
a
stranger
with
us
yet
we
treat
him
well
we
call
him
our
black
prince
so
thick
and
glossy
is
his
coat
of
jet
you
well
might
say
that
you
have
never
met
a
cat
so
lordly
though
he
seems
to
brood
over
some
wrong
he
never
can
forget
we
know
that
he
could
tell
us
if
he
would
our
dear
black
prince
so
sad
so
gentle
and
so
good
iii
you
prattle
children
fritz
bestir
yourself
the
fire
needs
wood
so
hungry
is
the
wind
and
elsa
bring
the
platters
from
the
shelf
and
lay
the
table
you
too
gretchen
mind
for
you
of
late
are
carelessly
inclined
and
brittle
is
the
ware
make
haste
else
will
your
father
come
and
find
for
all
his
day
hard
work
but
churlish
fare
full
sure
i
am
no
man
works
harder
anywhere
iv
the
good
speaks
and
not
in
vain
for
promptly
all
her
willing
brood
obey
they
hear
the
dead
leaves
click
against
the
pane
updriven
by
the
wind
in
its
mad
play
one
might
be
thankful
that
one
need
not
stray
on
such
a
night
as
this
is
just
the
night
when
the
wild
huntsman
as
the
people
say
with
all
his
hounds
is
scouring
heaven
height
and
you
may
see
him
if
as
now
the
moon
be
bright
v
it
is
an
old
and
foolish
tale
be
still
for
now
i
think
your
father
step
i
hear
though
not
the
tune
he
whistles
down
the
hill
he
comes
is
at
the
door
why
goodman
dear
you
out
of
breath
bad
news
you
bring
i
fear
bad
news
the
goodman
smiles
with
half
a
frown
but
not
for
us
and
so
take
heart
of
cheer
i
own
i
out
of
breath
but
sit
ye
down
and
hear
the
strangest
thing
happened
in
this
town
vi
the
children
gather
at
their
father
knees
and
the
coming
story
wait
the
story
strange
the
story
sure
to
please
the
black
cat
who
absorbed
their
cares
but
late
is
left
to
hold
his
solitary
state
was
thus
the
father
said
as
i
came
home
i
reached
the
ruined
castle
postern
gate
just
at
the
time
the
bats
begin
to
roam
and
dart
with
heedless
wings
about
the
ivied
gloam
vii
when
on
my
left
along
the
crumbling
wall
against
the
pallid
afterglow
i
saw
a
funeral
train
with
sweeping
pall
and
mournful
bearers
in
a
double
row
i
rubbed
my
eyes
i
looked
again
and
lo
no
human
forms
composed
that
funeral
train
the
black
cat
eyes
of
glitter
so
he
rises
from
the
spot
where
he
hath
lain
and
listens
well
as
one
who
does
not
list
in
vain
viii
folk
say
the
schloss
was
ever
haunted
ground
but
tell
us
father
what
those
mourners
were
the
father
answered
smiling
as
he
frowned
now
if
told
by
some
strange
traveller
i
say
much
you
tax
our
faith
good
sir
but
truth
was
ever
priceless
unto
me
those
mourners
clad
in
somber
coats
of
fur
cats
no
more
nor
this
i
did
see
and
that
the
dead
grimalkin
was
of
high
degree
ix
up
up
the
chimney
go
the
sparks
apace
up
up
to
vanish
in
the
gusty
sky
the
black
cat
look
he
leaves
his
wonted
place
and
hark
he
speaks
king
of
cats
am
i
and
with
this
first
and
last
word
for
up
up
the
chimney
he
hath
vanished
quite
our
dear
our
good
black
prince
the
children
cry
we
always
thought
he
should
be
king
by
right
but
we
shall
miss
him
sadly
both
by
day
and
night
x
the
legend
saith
i
know
no
more
than
you
reader
of
fairy
lore
with
fancy
fraught
that
humble
hearth
nor
evil
fortune
knew
nor
discontent
long
time
the
children
sought
for
tidings
of
the
lost
yet
heard
they
naught
but
sometimes
of
a
winter
eventide
when
all
was
bright
within
the
children
thought
that
when
they
called
up
through
the
chimney
wide
thence
with
a
gentle
purr
their
olden
friend
replied
waifs
wept
the
child
that
no
one
knew
wandering
on
without
a
clew
wept
so
softly
none
did
stay
so
farther
yet
he
went
astray
cried
the
lamb
that
missed
the
fold
trembling
more
from
fear
than
cold
i
am
lost
and
thou
art
lost
both
upon
the
wide
world
tossed
why
not
wander
on
together
through
the
bright
or
cloudy
weather
then
the
child
that
no
one
knew
looked
through
eyes
that
shone
like
dew
laughed
and
wept
lost
as
i
am
come
with
me
thou
poor
lost
lamb
moaned
the
youngling
left
by
the
flock
of
flight
bereft
thou
art
lost
and
we
are
lost
all
upon
the
wide
world
tossed
why
not
wander
on
together
through
the
bright
or
cloudy
weather
then
the
child
that
no
one
knew
closer
to
the
nestling
drew
hand
beneath
and
hand
above
thus
he
held
the
quivering
dove
still
they
wander
on
together
through
the
bright
or
cloudy
weather
spotless
lamb
and
dove
and
child
comrades
in
the
lonesome
wild
child
and
lamb
and
nestling
dove
truth
and
innocence
and
love
blest
their
hearth
and
blest
their
field
who
to
these
a
shelter
yield
of
the
pavement
i
sighed
for
flowers
in
wintry
hours
when
gardens
were
a
loveless
waste
mine
eye
fell
on
the
pavement
stone
there
flowers
and
flowers
and
flowers
were
traced
for
me
alone
the
pavement
stone
that
garden
pleasance
did
prepare
or
else
would
others
stop
to
see
what
flowers
and
flowers
and
flowers
bloom
there
stars
of
the
snow
the
stars
are
falling
are
falling
by
and
meadow
and
wood
they
silence
the
whispering
leaves
and
swiftly
and
softly
they
brood
the
robin
lone
nest
in
the
eaves
the
stars
are
falling
are
falling
yet
night
has
lost
never
a
one
of
all
that
are
gathered
below
they
melt
in
the
sun
for
these
are
the
stars
of
the
snow
the
stars
are
falling
are
falling
look
on
your
sleeve
is
a
star
and
perfect
its
form
its
comrades
are
all
gems
of
this
june
in
the
sky
slow
through
the
light
and
silent
air
up
climbs
the
smoke
on
its
spiral
stair
the
visible
flight
of
some
mortal
prayer
the
trees
are
in
bloom
with
the
flowers
of
frost
but
never
a
feathery
leaf
is
lost
the
spring
descending
is
caught
and
bound
ere
its
silver
feet
can
touch
the
ground
so
still
is
the
air
that
lies
this
morn
over
the
fields
forlorn
is
as
though
italy
heaven
smiled
in
the
face
of
some
bleak
norwegian
wild
and
the
heart
in
me
sings
i
know
not
why
is
winter
on
earth
but
june
in
the
sky
june
in
the
sky
ah
now
i
can
see
the
souls
of
roses
about
to
be
in
gardens
of
heaven
beckoning
me
roses
and
roses
pale
fanned
by
the
tremulous
ether
gale
some
of
them
climbing
a
some
of
them
peering
from
wayside
hedge
as
yonder
adrift
on
the
aery
stream
love
drives
his
plumed
and
filleted
team
the
angel
of
summer
aloft
i
see
and
the
souls
of
roses
about
to
be
and
the
heart
in
me
sings
the
heart
knows
why
is
winter
on
earth
but
june
in
the
sky
mother
earth
o
mother
tuck
the
children
in
and
draw
the
curtains
round
their
heads
and
mother
when
the
storms
begin
let
storms
forbear
those
cradle
beds
and
if
the
sleepers
wake
too
soon
say
children
is
too
early
yet
and
hush
them
with
a
sleepy
tune
and
closer
draw
the
coverlet
o
mother
earth
be
good
to
all
the
little
sleepers
in
thy
care
and
when
is
time
to
wake
them
call
a
beam
of
sun
a
breath
of
air
the
rain
rains
every
day
said
the
robin
to
his
mate
in
the
dripping
orchard
tree
our
dear
nest
will
have
to
wait
till
the
blue
sky
we
can
see
birds
can
neither
work
nor
play
for
the
rain
rains
every
day
and
the
rain
rains
all
the
day
said
the
violet
to
the
leaf
i
can
scarcely
ope
my
eye
so
for
fear
i
come
to
grief
close
along
the
earth
i
lie
all
we
flowers
for
sunshine
pray
but
the
rain
rains
every
day
and
the
rain
rains
all
the
day
and
the
children
far
and
wide
they
too
wished
away
the
rain
all
their
sports
were
spoiled
outside
by
the
black
glove
at
the
pane
very
dull
indoors
to
stay
while
the
rain
rains
every
day
and
the
rain
rains
all
the
day
up
and
down
the
murmurs
run
shared
by
child
and
bird
and
flower
suddenly
the
golden
sun
dazzled
through
a
clearing
shower
then
they
all
forgot
to
say
that
the
rain
rains
every
day
and
the
rain
rains
all
the
day
the
good
by
when
the
little
girl
said
good
by
at
the
turn
of
the
road
on
the
hill
was
there
a
tear
in
her
eye
and
why
did
she
keep
so
still
when
the
little
girl
said
good
by
she
never
looked
back
at
all
was
there
a
tear
in
her
eye
i
thought
i
could
hear
it
fall
and
then
were
the
flowers
more
sweet
and
the
grass
breathed
a
long
low
sigh
i
know
for
i
heard
my
heart
beat
there
a
tear
in
her
eye
