the

the

stood
still
and
the

were
all
laying
their

to

and
the

look
like

it

my

the

said

is
athirst
and
from

depths
of

cool
well
under

leaning
tree
she
drew
refreshing
water
and
with
thoughts
of

sweet
goodness
stirring
at

heart
she
bless
her
beautiful
boy
and
to
his
way
committed
him
and
he
went
lightly
on
with
his
soft
hands
press
closely
to
the
cool
stone
vessel
and
his
little
naked
feet
lifted
with
watchful
care
and
the
hills
and
thro
the
light
green
hollows
where
the
lambs
go
for
the
tender
grass
he
kept
his
way
wiling
its
distance
with
his
simple
thoughts
till
in
the
wilderness
of
sheaves
with
brows
throbbing
with
heat
he
set
his
burden
down
childhood
is
restless
ever
and
the
boy
stay
not
within
the
shadow
of
the
tree
but
with
a
joyous
industry
went
forth
into
the
reapers
places
and
bound
up
his
tiny
sheaves
and
plaited
cunningly
the
pliant
withs
out
of
the
shining
straw
cheering
their
labor
on
till
they
forgot
the
very
weariness
of
their
stooping
toil
in
the
beguiling
of
his
earnest
mirth
presently
he
was
silent
and
his
eye
closed
as
with
dizzy
pain
and
with
his
hand
press
hard
upon
his
forehead
and
his
breast
heaving
with
the
suppression
of
a
cry
he
uttered
a
faint
murmur
and
fell
back
upon
the
loosen
sheaf
insensible
they
bore
him
to
his
mother
and
he
lay
upon
her
knees
till
noon
and
then
he
died
she
had
watch
every
breath
and
kept
her
hand
soft
on
his
forehead
and
gaz
in
upon
the
dreamy
languor
of
his
listless
eye
and
she
had
laid
back
all
his
sunny
curls
and
kiss
his
delicate
lip
and
lifted
him
into
her
bosom
till
her
heart
grew
strong
his
beauty
was
so
unlike
death
she
leaned
over
him
now
that
she
might
catch
the
low
sweet
music
of
his
breath
that
she
had
to
love
when
he
was
slumbering
at
her
side
in
his
unconscious
infancy
so
still
is
a
soft
sleep
how
beautiful
he
lies
with
his
fair
forehead
and
the
rosy
veins
playing
so
freshly
in
his
sunny
cheek
how
could
they
say
that
he
would
die
oh
god
i
could
not
lose
him
i
have
treasured
all
his
childhood
in
my
heart
and
even
now
as
he
has
slept
my
memory
has
been
there
counting
like
ingots
all
his
winning
ways
his
unforgotten
sweetness
yet
so
still
how
like
this
breathless
slumber
is
to
death
i
could
believe
that
in
that
bosom
now
there
were
no
pulse
it
beats
so
languidly
i
can
not
see
it
stir
but
his
red
lip
death
would
not
be
so
very
beautiful
and
that
half
smile
would
death
have
left
there
and
should
i
not
have
felt
that
he
would
die
and
have
i
not
wept
over
him
and
prayed
morning
and
night
for
him
and
he
die
no
god
will
keep
him
he
will
be
my
pride
many
long
years
to
come
and
this
fair
hair
will
darken
like
his
father
and
his
eye
be
of
a
deeper
blue
when
he
is
grown
and
he
will
be
so
tall
and
i
shall
look
with
such
a
pride
upon
him
to
die
and
the
fond
mother
lifted
his
soft
curls
and
smiled
as
if
mockery
to
think
that
such
fair
things
could
perish
suddenly
her
hand
shrunk
from
him
and
the
color
fled
from
her
fix
lip
and
her
supporting
knees
were
shook
beneath
her
child
her
hand
had
his
forehead
as
she
dallied
with
his
hair
and
it
was
cold
like
clay
slow
very
slow
came
the
misgiving
that
her
child
was
dead
she
sat
a
moment
and
her
eyes
were
in
a
still
prayer
for
strength
and
then
she
took
his
little
hand
and
press
it
earnestly
and
put
her
lip
to
his
and
look
again
fearfully
on
him
and
then
bending
low
she
whisper
in
his
ear
my
son
my
son
and
as
the
echo
died
and
not
a
sound
broke
on
the
stillness
and
he
lay
there
still
motionless
on
her
knee
the
truth
come
and
with
a
sharp
quick
cry
as
if
her
heart
were
crush
she
lifted
him
and
held
him
close
into
her
bosom
with
a
mother
thought
as
if
death
had
no
power
to
touch
him
there
the
man
of
god
came
forth
and
led
the
child
unto
his
mother
and
went
on
his
way
and
he
was
there
her
beautiful
her
own
living
and
smiling
on
her
with
his
arms
folded
about
her
neck
and
his
warm
breath
breathing
upon
her
lips
and
in
her
ear
the
music
of
his
gentle
voice
once
more
oh
for
a
burning
word
that
would
express
the
measure
of
a
mother
holy
joy
when
god
has
given
back

her
her

iv
scene
in
gethsemane
the
moon
was
shining
yet
the
orient
brow
set
with
the
morning
star
was
not
yet
dim
and
the
deep
silence
which
subdues
the
breath
like
a
strong
feeling
hung
upon
the
world
as
sleep
upon
the
pulses
of
a
child
was
the
last
watch
of
night
gethsemane
with
its
bath
leaves
of
silver
seem
in
visible
stillness
and
as
jesus
voice
with
its
bewildering
sweetness
met
the
ear
of
his
disciples
it
vibrated
on
like
the
first
whisper
in
a
silent
world
they
came
on
slowly
heaviness
the
saviour
heart
and
when
the
kindnesses
of
his
deep
love
were
pour
he
felt
the
need
of
near
communion
for
his
gift
of
strength
was
wasted
by
the
spirit
weariness
he
left
them
there
and
went
a
little
on
and
in
the
depth
of
that
hush
silentness
alone
with
god
he
fell
upon
his
face
and
as
his
heart
was
broken
with
the
rush
of
his
surpassing
agony
and
death
wrung
to
him
from
a
dying
universe
were
mightier
than
the
son
of
man
could
bear
he
gave
his
sorrows
way
and
in
the
deep
prostration
of
his
soul
breathed
out
the
prayer
father
if
it
be
possible
with
thee
let
this
cup
pass
from
me
oh
how
a
word
like
the
forc
drop
before
the
fountain
breaks
stilleth
the
press
of
human
agony
the
saviour
felt
its
quiet
in
his
soul
and
though
his
strength
was
weakness
and
the
light
which
led
him
on
till
now
was
sorely
dim
he
breathed
a
new
submission
not
my
will
but
thine
be
done
oh
father
as
he
spoke
voices
were
heard
in
heaven
and
music
stole
out
from
the
chambers
of
the
vaulted
sky
as
if
the
stars
were
swept
like
instruments
no
cloud
was
visible
but
radiant
wings
were
coming
with
a
silvery
rush
to
earth
and
as
the
saviour
rose
a
glorious
one
with
an
illumin
forehead
and
the
light
whose
fountain
is
the
mystery
of
god
encalm
within
his
eye
bow
down
to
him
and
nerv
him
with
a
ministry
of
strength
it
was
enough
and
with
his
godlike
brow
of
his
father
messenger
with
meekness
whose
divinity
is
more
than
power
and
glory
he
return
again
to
his
disciples
and
awak
their
sleep
for
he
that
should
betray
him
was
at
hand
contemplation
are
all
up
the
innumerable
stars
and
hold
their
place
in
heaven
my
eyes
have
been
searching
the
pearly
depths
through
which
they
spring
like
beautiful
creations
till
i
feel
as
if
it
were
a
new
and
perfect
world
waiting
in
silence
for
the
word
of
god
to
breathe
it
into
motion
there
they
stand
shining
in
order
like
a
living
hymn
written
in
light
awaking
at
the
breath
of
the
celestial
dawn
and
praising
him
who
made
them
with
the
harmony
of
spheres
i
would
i
had
an
angel
ear
to
list
that
melody
i
would
that
i
might
float
up
in
that
boundless
element
and
feel
its
ravishing
vibrations
like
a
pulse
beating
in
heaven
my
spirit
is
athirst
for
music
rarer
music
i
would
bathe
my
soul
in
a
serener
atmosphere
than
this
i
long
to
mingle
with
the
flock
led
by
the
living
waters
and
lie
down
in
the
green
pastures
of
the
better
land
when
wilt
thou
break
dull
fetter
when
shall
i
gather
my
wings
and
like
a
rushing
thought
stretch
onward
star
by
star
up
into
heaven
thus
mused
alethe
she
was
one
to
whom
life
had
been
like
the
witching
of
a
dream
of
an
untroubled
sweetness
she
was
born
of
a
high
race
and
laid
upon
the
knee
with
her
soft
eye
perusing
listlessly
the
fretted
roof
or
on
mosaic
floors
grasped
at
the
tessellated
squares
inwrought
with
metals
curiously
her
childhood
like
faery
amid
fountains
and
green
haunts
trying
her
little
feet
upon
a
lawn
of
velvet
evenness
and
hiding
flowers
in
her
sweet
bosom
as
it
were
a
fair
and
pearly
altar
to
crush
incense
on
her
youth
oh
that
was
queenly
she
was
like
a
dream
of
poetry
that
may
not
be
written
or
told
exceeding
beautiful
and
so
came
worshippers
and
rank
bow
down
and
breathed
upon
her
heart
as
with
a
breath
of
pride
and
bound
her
forehead
gorgeously
with
dazzling
scorn
and
gave
unto
her
step
a
majesty
as
if
she
trod
the
sea
and
the
proud
waves
unbidden
lifted
her
and
so
she
grew
to
woman
her
mere
look
strong
as
a
monarch
signet
and
her
hand
the
ambition
of
a
kingdom
from
all
this
turn
her
high
heart
away
she
had
a
mind
deep
and
immortal
and
it
would
not
feed
on
pageantry
she
thirsted
for
a
spring
of
a
serener
element
and
drank
philosophy
and
for
a
little
while
she
was
allay
till
presently
it
bitter
within
her
and
her
spirit
grew
faint
for
undying
waters
then
she
came
to
the
pure
fount
of
god
and
is
athirst
no
more
save
when
the
fever
of
the
world
falleth
upon
her
she
will
go
sometimes
out
in
the
starlight
quietness
and
breathe
a
holy
aspiration
after
heaven
sketch
of
a
schoolfellow
he
sat
by
me
in
school
his
face
is
now
vividly
in
my
mind
as
if
he
went
from
me
but
yesterday
its
pleasant
smile
and
the
rich
joyous
laughter
of
his
eye
and
the
free
play
of
his
unhaughty
lip
so
redolent
of
his
heart
he
was
not
fair
nor
singular
nor
of
books
and
never
melancholy
when
alone
he
was
the
heartiest
in
the
ring
the
last
home
from
the
summer
wanderings
and
the
first
over
the
threshold
when
the
school
was
done
all
of
us
loved
him
we
shall
speak
his
name
in
the
far
years
to
come
and
think
of
him
when
we
have
lost
life
simplest
passages
and
pray
for
him
forgetting
he
is
dead
life
was
in
him
so
passing
beautiful
his
childhood
had
been
wasted
in
the
close
and
airless
city
he
had
never
thought
that
the
blue
sky
was
ample
or
the
stars
many
in
heaven
or
the
chainless
wind
of
a
medicinal
freshness
he
had
perilous
tricks
of
manhood
and
his
hand
was
ready
and
his
confidence
in
himself
bold
as
a
quarreller
then
he
came
away
to
the
unshelter
hills
and
brought
an
eye
new
as
a
babe
to
nature
and
an
ear
as
ignorant
of
its
music
he
was
sad
the
broad
hill
sides
seem
desolate
and
the
woods
gloomy
and
dim
and
the
perpetual
sound
of
wind
and
waters
and
unquiet
leaves
like
the
monotony
of
a
dirge
he
pined
for
the
familiar
things
until
his
heart
sicken
for
home
and
so
he
stole
away
to
the
most
silent
places
and
lay
down
to
weep
upon
the
mosses
of
the
slopes
and
follow
listlessly
the
silver
streams
till
he
found
out
the
unsunn
shadowings
and
the
green
openings
to
the
sky
and
grew
fond
of
them
all
insensibly
he
found
sweet
company
in
the
brooks
and
loved
to
sit
and
bathe
his
fingers
wantonly
and
feel
the
wind
upon
his
forehead
and
the
leaves
took
a
beguiling
whisper
to
his
ear
and
the
music
and
the
blast
swept
like
an
instrument
the
sounding
trees
his
heart
went
back
to
its
simplicity
as
the
stirr
waters
in
the
night
grow
pure
sadness
and
silence
and
the
woods
won
on
his
love
so
well
and
he
forgot
his
pride
and
his
assumingness
and
lost
the
mimicry
of
the
man
and
so
his
very
character
till
he
became
as
diffident
as
a
girl
is
very
strange
how
nature
sometimes
wins
upon
a
child
th
experience
of
the
world
is
not
on
him
and
poetry
has
not
upon
his
brain
left
a
mock
thirst
for
solitude
nor
love
writ
on
his
forehead
the
effeminate
shame
which
hideth
from
men
eyes
he
has
a
full
shadowless
heart
and
it
is
always
toned
more
merrily
than
the
chastened
voice
of
winds
and
waters
yet
he
often
in
his
mirth
stops
by
the
running
brooks
and
suddenly
loiters
he
knows
not
why
and
at
the
sight
of
the
spread
meadows
and
the
lifted
hills
feels
an
unquiet
pleasure
and
forgets
to
listen
for
his
fellows
he
will
grow
fond
of
the
early
star
and
lie
awake
gazing
with
many
thoughts
upon
the
moon
and
lose
himself
in
the
deep
chamber
sky
with
his
untaught
philosophies
it
breeds
sadness
in
older
hearts
but
not
in
his
and
he
goes
merrier
to
his
play
and
shouts
louder
the
joyous
call
but
it
will
sink
into
his
memory
like
his
mother
prayer
for
after
years
to
brood
on
cheerful
thoughts
came
to
the
homesick
boy
as
he
became
wakeful
to
beauty
in
the
summer
change
and
he
came
oftener
to
our
noisy
play
cheering
us
on
with
his
delightful
shout
over
the
hills
and
giving
interest
with
his
keen
spirit
to
the
boyish
game
we
loved
him
for
his
carelessness
of
himself
and
his
perpetual
mirth
and
tho
he
stole
sometimes
away
into
the
woods
alone
and
wandered
unaccompanied
when
the
night
was
beautiful
he
was
our
idol
still
and
we
have
not
forgotten
him
tho
time
has
blotted
many
a
pleasant
memory
of
boyhood
out
and
we
are
wearing
old
with
the
unplayfulness
of
this
grown
up
world
idleness
the
rain
is
playing
its
soft
pleasant
tune
fitfully
on
the
skylight
and
the
shade
of
the
fast
flying
clouds
across
my
book
passes
with
delicate
change
my
merry
fire
sings
cheerfully
to
itself
my
musing
cat
purrs
as
she
wakes
from
her
unquiet
sleep
and
looks
into
my
face
as
if
she
felt
like
me
the
gentle
influence
of
the
rain
here
have
i
sat
since
morn
reading
sometimes
and
sometimes
listening
to
the
faster
fall
of
the
large
drops
or
rising
with
the
stir
of
an
unbidden
thought
have
walked
awhile
with
the
slow
steps
of
indolence
my
room
and
then
sat
down
composedly
again
to
my
quaint
book
of
olden
poetry
it
is
a
kind
of
idleness
i
know
and
i
am
said
to
be
an
idle
man
and
it
is
very
true
i
love
to
go
out
in
the
pleasant
sun
and
let
my
eye
rest
on
the
human
faces
that
pass
by
each
with
its
gay
or
busy
interest
and
then
i
muse
upon
their
lot
and
read
many
a
lesson
in
their
changeful
cast
and
so
grow
kind
of
heart
as
if
the
sight
of
human
beings
were
humanity
and
i
am
better
after
it
and
go
more
gratefully
to
my
rest
and
feel
a
love
stirring
my
heart
to
every
living
thing
and
my
low
prayer
has
more
humility
and
i
sink
lightlier
to
my
dreams
and
this
is
very
true
is
only
idleness
i
love
to
go
and
mingle
with
the
young
in
the
gay
festal
room
when
every
heart
is
beating
faster
than
the
merry
tune
and
their
blue
eyes
are
restless
and
their
lips
parted
with
eager
joy
and
their
round
cheeks
flushed
with
the
beautiful
motion
of
the
dance
is
sweet
in
the
becoming
light
of
lamps
to
watch
a
brow
half
shaded
or
a
curl
playing
upon
a
neck
capriciously
or
unobserved
to
watch
in
its
delight
the
earnest
countenance
of
a
child
i
love
to
look
upon
such
things
and
i
can
go
back
to
my
solitude
and
dream
bright
dreams
for
their
fast
coming
years
and
speak
of
them
earnestly
in
my
prayer
till
i
am
glad
with
a
benevolent
joy
and
this
i
know
to
the
world
eye
is
only
idleness
and
when
the
clouds
pass
suddenly
away
and
the
blue
sky
is
like
a
newer
world
and
the
sweet
growing
things
forest
and
flower
humble
and
beautiful
alike
are
all
breathing
up
odors
to
the
very
heaven
or
when
the
frost
has
yielded
to
the
sun
in
the
rich
autumn
and
the
filmy
mist
lies
like
a
silver
lining
on
the
sky
and
the
clear
air
exhilarates
and
life
simply
is
luxury
and
when
the
hush
of
twilight
like
a
gentle
sleep
steals
on
and
the
birds
settle
to
their
nests
and
stars
spring
in
the
upper
sky
and
there
is
not
a
sound
that
is
not
low
and
musical
at
all
these
pleasant
seasons
i
go
out
with
my
first
impulse
guiding
me
and
take
woodpath
or
stream
or
sunny
mountain
side
and
in
my
recklessness
of
heart
stray
on
glad
with
the
birds
and
silent
with
the
leaves
and
happy
with
the
fair
and
blessed
world
and
this
is
true
is
only
idleness
and
i
should
love
to
go
up
to
the
sky
and
course
the
heaven
like
stars
and
float
away
upon
the
gliding
clouds
that
have
no
stay
in
their
swift
journey
and
be
a
joy
to
walk
the
chambers
of
the
deep
and
tread
the
pearls
of
its
untrodden
floor
and
know
the
tribes
of
its
unfathomable
depths
dwellers
beneath
the
pressure
of
a
sea
and
i
should
love
to
issue
with
the
wind
on
a
strong
errand
and
the
earth
with
its
broad
continents
and
islands
green
like
to
the
passing
of
a
presence
on
and
this
is
true
were
only
idleness
on
the
death
of
edward
payson
a
servant
of
the
living
god
is
dead
his
errand
hath
been
well
and
early
done
and
early
hath
he
gone
to
his
reward
he
shall
come
no
more
forth
but
to
his
sleep
hath
silently
lain
down
and
so
shall
rest
would
ye
bewail
our
brother
he
hath
gone
to
abraham
bosom
he
shall
no
more
thirst
nor
hunger
but
forever
in
the
eye
holy
and
meek
of
jesus
he
may
look
unchided
and
untempted
and
unstained
would
ye
bewail
our
brother
he
hath
gone
to
sit
down
with
the
prophets
by
the
clear
and
crystal
waters
he
hath
gone
to
list
isaiah
harp
and
david
and
to
walk
with
enoch
and
elijah
and
the
host
of
the
just
men
made
perfect
he
shall
bow
at
gabriel
hallelujah
and
unfold
the
scroll
of
the
apocalypse
with
john
and
talk
of
christ
with
mary
and
go
back
to
the
last
supper
and
the
garden
prayer
with
the
belov
disciple
he
shall
hear
the
story
of
the
incarnation
told
by
simeon
and
the
triune
mystery
burning
upon
the
fervent
lips
of
paul
he
shall
have
wings
of
glory
and
shall
soar
to
the
remoter
firmaments
and
read
the
order
and
the
harmony
of
stars
and
in
the
might
of
knowledge
he
shall
bow
in
the
deep
pauses
of
archangel
harps
and
humble
as
the
seraphim
shall
cry
by
his
searching
finds
thee
out
oh
god
there
shall
he
meet
his
children
who
have
gone
before
him
and
as
other
years
roll
on
and
his
loved
flock
go
up
to
him
his
hand
again
shall
lead
them
gently
to
the
lamb
and
bring
them
to
the
living
waters
there
is
it
so
good
to
die
and
shall
we
mourn
that
he
is
taken
early
to
his
rest
tell
me
oh
mourner
for
the
man
of
god
shall
we
bewail
our
brother
that
he
died
the
was
a
rich
night
in
june
the
air
was
all
fragrance
and
balm
and
the
wet
leaves
were
stirred
by
the
soft
fingers
of
the
southern
wind
and
caught
the
light
capriciously
like
wings
haunting
the
greenwood
with
a
silvery
sheen
the
stars
might
not
be
numbered
and
the
moon
exceeding
beautiful
went
up
in
heaven
and
took
her
place
in
silence
and
a
hush
like
the
deep
sabbath
of
the
night
came
down
and
rested
upon
nature
i
was
out
with
three
sweet
sisters
wandering
and
my
thoughts
took
color
of
the
moonlight
and
of
them
and
i
was
calm
and
happy
their
deep
tones
low
in
the
stillness
and
by
that
soft
air
melted
to
reediness
bore
out
like
song
the
language
of
high
feelings
and
i
felt
how
excellent
is
woman
when
she
gives
to
the
fine
pulses
of
her
spirit
way
one
was
a
noble
being
with
a
brow
ample
and
pure
and
on
it
her
black
hair
was
parted
like
a
raven
wing
on
snow
her
tone
was
low
and
sweet
and
in
her
smile
you
read
intense
affections
her
moist
eye
had
a
most
rare
benignity
her
mouth
bland
and
unshadowed
sweetness
and
her
face
was
full
of
that
mild
dignity
that
gives
a
holiness
to
woman
she
was
one
whose
virtues
blossom
daily
and
pour
out
a
fragrance
upon
all
who
in
her
path
have
a
blest
fellowship
i
longed
to
be
her
brother
that
her
hand
might
lie
upon
my
forehead
and
her
gentle
voice
allay
the
fever
that
is
at
my
heart
sometimes
there
was
a
second
sister
who
might
witch
an
angel
from
his
hymn
i
can
not
tell
the
secret
of
her
beauty
it
is
more
than
her
slight
penciled
lip
and
her
arch
eye
laughing
beneath
its
lashes
as
if
life
were
nothing
but
a
merry
mask
is
more
than
motion
though
she
moveth
like
a
fay
or
music
though
her
voice
is
like
a
reed
blown
by
a
low
south
wind
or
cunning
grace
though
all
she
does
is
beautiful
or
thought
or
fancy
or
a
delicate
sense
though
mind
is
her
best
gift
and
poetry
her
world
and
she
will
see
strange
beauty
in
a
flower
as
by
a
subtle
vision
i
care
not
to
know
how
she
bewitches
is
enough
for
me
that
i
can
listen
to
her
voice
and
dream
rare
dreams
of
music
or
converse
upon
unwrit
philosophy
till
i
am
wildered
beneath
thoughts
i
can
not
bound
and
the
red
lip
that
breathes
them
on
my
arm
leaned
an
unshadowed
girl
who
scarcely
yet
had
numbered
fourteen
summers
i
know
not
how
i
shall
draw
her
picture
the
young
heart
has
such
a
restlessness
of
change
and
each
of
its
wild
moods
so
lovely
i
can
see
her
figure
in
its
rounded
beauty
now
with
her
step
her
clustering
hair
bathing
a
neck
like
hebe
and
her
face
by
a
glad
heart
made
radiant
she
was
full
of
the
romance
of
girlhood
the
fair
world
was
like
an
unmarred
eden
to
her
eye
and
every
sound
was
music
and
the
tint
of
every
cloud
a
silent
poetry
light
to
thy
path
bright
creature
i
would
charm
thy
being
if
i
could
that
it
should
be
ever
as
now
thou
dreamest
and
flow
on
thus
innocent
and
beautiful
to
heaven
we
walked
beneath
the
full
and
mellow
moon
till
the
late
stars
had
risen
it
was
not
in
silence
though
we
did
not
seem
to
break
the
hush
with
our
low
voices
but
our
thoughts
stirred
deeply
at
their
sources
and
when
night
divided
us
i
slumbered
with
a
peace
floating
about
my
heart
which
only
comes
from
high
communion
i
shall
never
see
that
silver
moon
again
without
a
crowd
of
gentle
memories
and
a
silent
prayer
that
when
the
night
of
life
shall
oversteal
your
sky
ye
lovely
sisters
there
may
be
a
light
as
beautiful
to
lead
you
on
january
fleetly
hath
past
the
year
the
seasons
came
duly
as
they
are
wont
the
gentle
spring
and
the
delicious
summer
and
the
cool
rich
autumn
with
the
nodding
of
the
grain
and
winter
like
an
old
and
hoary
man
frosty
and
stiff
and
so
are
chronicled
we
have
read
gladness
in
the
new
green
leaf
and
in
the
first
blown
violets
we
have
drunk
cool
water
from
the
rock
and
in
the
shade
sunk
to
the
slumber
we
have
eat
the
mellow
fruitage
of
the
bending
tree
and
girded
to
our
pleasant
wanderings
when
the
cool
wind
came
freshly
from
the
hills
and
when
the
tinting
of
the
autumn
leaves
had
faded
from
its
glory
we
have
sat
by
the
good
fires
of
winter
and
rejoiced
over
the
fulness
of
the
gathered
sheaf
god
hath
been
very
good
is
he
whose
hand
moulded
the
sunny
hills
and
hollowed
out
the
shelter
of
the
valleys
and
doth
keep
the
fountains
in
their
secret
places
cool
and
it
is
he
who
leadeth
up
the
sun
and
ordereth
the
starry
influences
and
tempereth
the
keenness
of
the
frost
and
therefore
in
the
plenty
of
the
feast
and
in
the
lifting
of
the
cup
let
him
have
praises
for
the
year
january
winter
is
come
again
the
sweet
south
west
is
a
forgotten
wind
and
the
strong
earth
has
laid
aside
its
mantle
to
be
bound
by
the
frost
fetter
there
is
not
a
sound
save
of
the
skaiter
heel
and
there
is
laid
an
icy
finger
on
the
lip
of
streams
and
the
clear
icicle
hangs
cold
and
still
and
the
is
noiseless
as
a
thought
spring
has
a
rushing
sound
and
summer
sends
many
sweet
voices
with
its
odors
out
and
autumn
rustleth
its
decaying
robe
with
a
complaining
whisper
winter
dumb
god
made
his
ministry
a
silent
one
and
he
has
given
him
a
foot
of
steel
and
an
unlovely
aspect
and
a
breath
sharp
to
the
senses
and
we
know
that
he
tempereth
well
and
hath
a
meaning
hid
under
the
shadow
of
his
hand
look
up
and
it
shall
be
interpreted
your
home
hath
a
temptation
now
there
is
no
voice
of
waters
with
beguiling
for
your
ear
and
the
cool
forest
and
the
meadows
green
witch
not
your
feet
away
and
in
the
dells
there
are
no
violets
and
upon
the
hills
there
are
no
sunny
places
to
lie
down
you
must
go
in
and
by
your
cheerful
fire
wait
for
the
offices
of
love
and
hear
accents
of
human
tenderness
and
feast
your
eye
upon
the
beauty
of
the
young
it
is
a
season
for
the
quiet
thought
and
the
still
reckoning
with
thyself
the
year
gives
back
the
spirits
of
its
dead
and
time
whispers
the
history
of
its
vanished
hours
and
the
heart
calling
its
affections
up
counteth
its
wasted
ingots
life
stands
still
and
settles
like
a
fountain
and
the
eye
sees
clearly
through
its
depths
and
noteth
all
that
stirred
its
troubled
waters
it
is
well
that
winter
with
the
dying
year
should
come
psyche
before
the
tribunal
of
venus
lift
up
thine
eyes
sweet
psyche
what
is
she
that
those
soft
fringes
timidly
should
fall
before
her
and
thy
spiritual
brow
be
shadowed
as
her
presence
were
a
cloud
a
loftier
gift
is
thine
than
she
can
give
that
queen
of
beauty
she
may
mould
the
brow
to
perfectness
and
give
unto
the
form
a
beautiful
proportion
she
may
stain
the
eye
with
a
celestial
blue
the
cheek
with
carmine
of
the
sunset
she
may
breathe
grace
into
every
motion
like
the
play
of
the
least
visible
tissue
of
a
cloud
she
may
give
all
that
is
within
her
own
bright
cestus
and
one
silent
look
of
thine
like
stronger
magic
will
outcharm
it
all
ay
for
the
soul
is
better
than
its
frame
the
spirit
than
its
temple
what
the
brow
or
the
eye
lustre
or
the
step
of
air
or
color
but
the
beautiful
links
that
chain
the
mind
from
its
rare
element
there
lies
a
talisman
in
intellect
which
yields
celestial
music
when
the
master
hand
touches
it
cunningly
it
sleeps
beneath
the
outward
semblance
and
to
common
sight
is
an
invisible
and
hidden
thing
but
when
the
lip
is
faded
and
the
cheek
robbed
of
its
daintiness
and
when
the
form
witches
the
sense
no
more
and
human
love
falters
in
its
idolatry
this
spell
will
hold
its
strength
unbroken
and
go
on
stealing
anew
the
affections
marvel
not
that
love
leans
sadly
on
his
bended
bow
he
hath
found
out
the
loveliness
of
mind
and
he
is
spoilt
for
beauty
so
be
ever
the
glory
of
the
human
form
is
but
a
perishing
thing
and
love
will
droop
when
its
brief
grace
hath
faded
but
the
mind
perisheth
not
and
when
the
outward
charm
hath
had
its
brief
existence
it
awakes
and
is
the
lovelier
that
it
slept
so
long
like
wells
that
by
the
wasting
of
their
flow
have
had
their
deeper
fountains
broken
up
on
seeing
a
beautiful
boy
at
play
down
the
green
slope
he
bounded
raven
curls
from
his
white
shoulders
by
the
winds
were
swept
and
the
clear
color
of
his
sunny
cheek
was
bright
with
motion
through
his
open
lips
shone
visibly
a
delicate
line
of
pearl
like
a
white
vein
within
a
rosy
shell
and
his
dark
eye
clear
brilliance
as
it
lay
beneath
his
lashes
like
a
drop
of
dew
hid
in
the
moss
stole
out
as
covertly
as
starlight
from
the
edging
of
a
cloud
i
never
saw
a
boy
so
beautiful
his
step
was
like
the
stooping
of
a
bird
and
his
limbs
melted
into
grace
like
things
shaped
by
the
wind
of
summer
he
was
like
a
painter
fine
conception
such
an
one
as
he
would
have
of
ganymede
and
weep
upon
his
pallet
that
he
could
not
win
the
vision
to
his
easel
who
could
paint
the
young
and
shadowless
spirit
who
could
chain
the
visible
gladness
of
a
heart
that
lives
like
a
glad
fountain
in
the
eye
of
light
with
an
unbreathing
pencil
nature
gift
has
nothing
that
is
like
it
sun
and
stream
and
the
new
leaves
of
june
and
the
young
lark
that
flees
away
into
the
depths
of
heaven
lost
in
his
own
wild
music
and
the
breath
of
springtime
and
the
summer
eve
and
noon
in
the
cool
autumn
are
like
fingers
swept
over
affections
but
the
joy
that
enters
to
the
spirit
of
a
child
is
deep
as
his
young
heart
his
very
breath
the
simple
sense
of
being
is
enough
to
ravish
him
and
like
a
thrilling
touch
he
feels
each
moment
of
his
life
go
by
beautiful
beautiful
childhood
with
a
joy
that
like
a
robe
is
palpable
and
flung
out
by
your
every
motion
delicate
bud
of
the
immortal
flower
that
will
unfold
and
come
to
its
maturity
in
heaven
i
weep
your
earthly
glory
is
a
light
lent
to
the
new
born
spirit
that
goes
out
with
the
first
idle
wind
it
is
the
leaf
fresh
flung
upon
the
river
that
will
dance
upon
the
wave
that
stealeth
out
its
life
then
sink
of
its
own
heaviness
the
face
of
the
delightful
earth
will
to
your
eye
grow
dim
the
fragrance
of
the
many
flowers
be
noticed
not
and
the
beguiling
voice
of
nature
in
her
gentleness
will
be
to
manhood
senseless
ear
inaudible
i
sigh
to
look
upon
thy
face
young
boy
a
child
first
impression
of
a
star
she
had
been
told
that
god
made
all
the
stars
that
twinkled
up
in
heaven
and
now
she
stood
watching
the
coming
of
the
twilight
on
as
if
it
were
a
new
and
perfect
world
and
this
were
its
first
eve
how
beautiful
must
be
the
work
of
nature
to
a
child
in
its
first
fresh
impression
laura
stood
by
the
low
window
with
the
silken
lash
of
her
soft
eye
upraised
and
her
sweet
mouth
half
parted
with
the
new
and
strange
delight
of
beauty
that
she
could
not
comprehend
and
had
not
seen
before
the
purple
folds
of
the
low
sunset
clouds
and
the
blue
sky
that
look
so
still
and
delicate
above
fill
her
young
heart
with
gladness
and
the
eve
stole
on
with
its
deep
shadows
and
she
still
stood
looking
at
the
west
with
that
half
smile
as
if
a
pleasant
thought
were
at
her
heart
presently
in
the
edge
of
the
last
tint
of
sunset
where
the
blue
was
melted
in
to
the
faint
golden
mellowness
a
star
stood
suddenly
a
laugh
of
wild
delight
burst
from
her
lips
and
putting
up
her
hands
her
simple
thought
broke
forth
expressively
father
dear
father
god
has
made
a
star
dedication
hymn
the
perfect
world
by
adam
trod
was
the
first
temple
built
by
god
his
fiat
laid
the
corner
stone
and
heav
its
pillars
one
by
one
he
hung
its
starry
roof
on
high
the
broad
illimitable
sky
he
spread
its
pavement
green
and
bright
and
curtain
it
with
morning
light
the
mountains
in
their
places
stood
the
sea
the
sky
and
all
was
good
and
when
its
first
pure
praises
rang
the
morning
stars
together
sang
lord
is
not
ours
to
make
the
sea
and
earth
and
sky
a
house
for
thee
but
in
thy
sight
our
stands
a
humbler
temple
made
with
hands
the
baptism
she
stood
up
in
the
meekness
of
a
heart
resting
on
god
and
held
her
fair
young
child
upon
her
bosom
with
its
gentle
eyes
folded
in
sleep
as
if
its
soul
had
gone
to
whisper
the
baptismal
vow
in
heaven
the
prayer
went
up
devoutly
and
the
lips
of
the
good
man
glowed
fervently
with
faith
that
it
would
be
even
as
he
had
pray
and
the
sweet
child
be
gather
to
the
fold
of
jesus
as
the
holy
words
went
on
her
lips
mov
silently
and
tears
fast
tears
stole
from
beneath
her
lashes
and
upon
the
forehead
of
the
beautiful
child
lay
soft
with
the
baptismal
water
then
i
thought
that
to
the
eye
of
god
that
mother
tears
would
be
a
deeper
covenant
which
sin
and
the
temptations
of
the
world
and
death
would
leave
unbroken
and
that
she
would
know
in
the
clear
light
of
heaven
how
very
strong
the
prayer
which
press
them
from
her
heart
had
been
in
leading
its
young
spirit
up
to
god
the
table
of
emerald
deep
it
is
said
under
yonder
pyramid
has
for
ages
lain
concealed
the
table
of
emerald
on
which
the
hermes
engraved
before
the
flood
the
secret
of
alchemy
that
gives
gold
at
will
that
green
of
the
pyramid
were
i
where
it
is
laid
i
ask
no
king
for
his
heavy
crown
as
its
hidden
words
were
said
the
pomp
and
the
glitter
of
worldly
pride
should
fetter
my
moments
not
and
the
natural
thought
of
an
open
mind
should
govern
alone
my
lot
would
i
feast
all
day
revel
all
night
laugh
with
a
weary
heart
would
i
sleep
away
the
breezy
morn
and
wake
till
the
stars
depart
would
i
gain
no
knowledge
and
search
no
deep
for
the
wisdom
that
sages
knew
would
i
run
to
waste
with
a
human
mind
to
its
noble
trust
untrue
oh
knew
i
the
depth
of
that
green
and
knew
i
the
spell
of
gold
i
would
never
poison
a
fresh
young
heart
with
the
taint
of
customs
old
i
would
bind
no
wreath
to
my
forehead
free
in
whose
shadow
a
thought
would
die
nor
drink
from
the
cup
of
revelry
the
ruin
my
gold
would
buy
but
i
break
the
fetters
of
care
worn
things
and
be
spirit
and
fancy
free
my
mind
should
go
up
where
it
longs
to
go
and
the
limitless
wind
outflee
i
climb
to
the
eyries
of
eagle
men
till
the
stars
became
a
scroll
and
pour
right
on
like
the
even
sea
in
the
strength
of
a
governed
soul
ambition
ambition
i
laughed
to
scorn
thy
robe
and
thy
gleaming
sword
i
would
follow
sooner
a
woman
eye
or
the
spell
of
a
gentle
word
but
come
with
the
glory
of
human
mind
and
the
light
of
the
scholar
brow
and
my
heart
shall
be
taught
forgetfulness
and
alone
at
thy
altar
bow
there
was
one
dark
eye
it
hath
passed
away
there
was
one
deep
tone
is
not
could
i
see
it
now
could
i
hear
it
now
ye
were
all
too
well
forgot
my
heart
brought
up
from
its
chambers
deep
the
sum
of
its
earthly
love
but
it
might
not
could
not
buy
like
heaven
and
she
stole
to
her
rest
above
that
first
deep
love
i
have
taken
back
in
my
rayless
heart
to
hide
with
the
tear
it
brought
for
a
burning
seal
there
forever
bide
i
may
stretch
on
now
to
a
nobler
ken
i
may
live
in
my
thoughts
of
flame
the
tie
is
broken
that
kept
me
back
and
my
spirit
is
on
for
fame
but
alas
i
am
dreaming
as
if
i
knew
the
spell
of
the
tablet
green
i
forgot
how
like
to
a
broken
reed
is
the
lot
on
which
i
lean
there
is
nothing
true
of
my
idle
dream
but
the
wreck
of
my
early
love
and
my
mind
is
coined
for
my
daily
bread
and
how
can
it
soar
above
the
annoyer

love
knoweth
every

and
comes
unbidden
everywhere
like
thought
mysterious
birth
the
moonlight
sea
and
the
sunset
sky
are
written
with
love
words
and
you
hear
his
voice
unceasingly
like
song
in
the
time
of
birds
he
peeps
into
the
warrior
heart
from
the
tip
of
a
stooping
plume
and
the
serried
spears
and
the
many
men
may
not
deny
him
room
he
come
to
his
tent
in
the
weary
night
and
be
busy
in
his
dream
and
he
float
to
his
eye
in
morning
light
like
a
fay
on
a
silver
beam
he
hears
the
sound
of
the
hunter
gun
and
rides
on
the
echo
back
and
sighs
in
his
ear
like
a
stirring
leaf
and
flits
in
his
woodland
track
the
shade
of
the
wood
and
the
sheen
of
the
river
the
cloud
and
the
open
sky
he
will
haunt
them
all
with
his
subtle
quiver
like
the
light
of
your
very
eye
the
fisher
hangs
over
the
leaning
boat
and
ponders
the
silver
sea
for
love
is
under
the
surface
hid
and
a
spell
of
thought
has
he
he
heaves
the
wave
like
a
bosom
sweet
and
speaks
in
the
ripple
low
till
the
bait
is
gone
from
the
crafty
line
and
the
hook
hangs
bare
below
he
blurs
the
print
of
the
scholar
book
and
intrudes
in
the
maiden
prayer
and
profanes
the
cell
of
the
holy
man
in
the
shape
of
a
lady
fair
in
the
darkest
night
and
the
bright
daylight
in
earth
and
sea
and
sky
in
every
home
of
human
thought

love
be
lurking
nigh
starlight
the
evening
star
will
twinkle
presently
the
last
small
bird
is
silent
and
the
bee
has
gone
into
his
hive
and
the
shut
flowers
are
bending
as
if
sleeping
on
the
stem
and
all
sweet
living
things
are
slumbering
in
the
deep
hush
of
nature
resting
time
the
faded
west
looks
deep
as
if
its
blue
were
searchable
and
even
as
i
look
the
twilight
hath
stole
over
it
and
made
its
liquid
eye
apparent
and
above
to
the
zenith
and
around
as
if
they
waited
on
her
like
a
queen

stole
out
the
innumerable
stars
to
twinkle
like
intelligence
in

it
not
beautiful
my
fair
adel
fit
for
the
young
affections
to
come
out
and
bathe
in
like
an
element
how
well
the
night
is
made
for
tenderness
so
still
that
the
low
whisper
scarcely
audible
is
heard
like
music
and
so
deeply
pure
that
the
fond
thought
is
chastened
as
it
springs
and
on
the
lip
made
holy
i
have
won
thy
heart
my
gentle
girl
but
it
hath
been
when
that
soft
eye
was
on
me
and
the
love
i
told
beneath
the
evening
influence
shall
be
as
constant
as
its
gentle
star
lassitude

will
throw
by

binds
upon
my
brow

distraction

give
morning
hath
seen
me
here
and
noon
and
eve
and
midnight
with
its
deep
and
solemn
hush
has
look
upon
my
labors
and
the
dawn
with
its
sweet
voices
and
its
tempting
breath
has
driven
me
to
rest
and
i
can
bear
the
burden
of
such
weariness
no
more
i
have
foregone
society
and
fled
from
a
sweet
sister
fondness
and
from
all
a
home
alluring
blandishments
and
now
when
i
am
thirsting
for
them
and
my
heart
would
leap
at
the
approaches
of
their
kind
and
gentle
offices
they
are
not
here
and
i
must
feel
that
i
am
all
alone
oh
for
the
fame
of
this
forgetful
world
how
much
we
suffer
were
it
for
this
were
nothing
but
the
empty
praise
of
men
the
guerdon
of
this
sedentary
toil
were
this
world
perishable
honors
i
bound
from
its
confinement
as
a
hart
leaps
from
its
hunters
but
i
know
that
when
my
name
shall
be
forgotten
and
my
frame
rests
from
its
labors
i
shall
find
above
a
work
for
the
capacities
i
win
and
as
i
discipline
my
spirit
here
my
lyre
shall
have
a
nobler
sweep

roaring
brook
cheshire
con
it
was
a
mountain
stream
that
with
the
leap
of
its
impatient
waters
had
worn
out
a
channel
in
the
rock
and
wash
away
the
earth
that
had
upheld
the
tall
old
trees
till
it
was
darken
with
the
shadowy
arch
of
the
branches
here
and
there
it
loiter
in
a
broad
and
limpid
pool
that
circled
round
demurely
and
anon
sprung
violently
over
where
the
rock
fell
suddenly
and
bore
its
bubbles
on
till
they
were
broken
by
the
hanging
moss
as
anger
with
a
gentle
word
grows
calm
in
when
the
snows
were
coming
down
and
in
the
flooding
of
the
autumn
rains
no
foot
might
enter
there
but
in
the
hot
and
thirsty
summer
when
the
fountains
slept
you
could
go
its
channel
in
the
shade
to
the
far
sources
with
a
brow
as
cool
as
in
the
grotto
of
the
anchorite
here
when
an
idle
student
have
i
come
and
in
a
hollow
of
the
rock
lain
down
and
mus
until
the
eventide
or
read
some
fine
old
poet
till
my
nook
became
a
haunt
of
faery
or
the
busy
flow
of
water
to
my
ear
seem
like
the
din
of
some
gay
tournament
pleasant
have
been
such
hours
and
tho
the
wise
have
said
that
i
was
indolent
and
they
who
taught
me
have
reprov
me
that
i
the
truant
in
the
leafy
month
of
june
i
deem
it
true
philosophy
in
him
whose
spirit
must
be
temper
of
the
world
to
loiter
with
these
wayside
comforters
the
declaration
was
late
and
the
gay
company
was
gone
and
light
lay
soft
on
the
deserted
room
from
alabaster
vases
and
a
scent
of
orange
leaves
and
sweet
verbena
came
through
the
unshutter
window
on
the
air
and
the
rich
pictures
with
their
dark
old
tints
hung
like
a
twilight
landscape
and
all
things
seem
hush
into
a
slumber
isabel
the
dark
eyed
spiritual
isabel
was
leaning
on
her
harp
and
i
had
staid
to
whisper
what
i
could
not
when
the
crowd
hung
on
her
look
like
worshippers
i
knelt
and
with
the
fervor
of
a
lip
unused
to
the
cool
breath
of
reason
told
my
love
there
was
no
answer
and
i
took
the
hand
that
rested
on
the
strings
and
pressed
a
kiss
upon
it
unforbidden
and
again
besought
her
that
this
silent
evidence
that
i
was
not
indifferent
to
her
heart
might
have
the
seal
of
one
sweet
syllable
i
kissed
the
small
white
fingers
as
i
spoke
and
she
withdrew
them
gently
and
upraised
her
forehead
from
its
resting
place
and
looked
earnestly
on
me
she
had
been
asleep
isabel
they
said
that
i
was
strange
i
could
not
bear
confinement
and
i
lov
to
feel
the
wind
blowing
upon
my
forehead
and
when
morn
came
like
an
inspiration
from
the
east
and
the
cool
earth
awaking
like
a
star
in
a
new
element
sent
out
its
voice
and
tempted
me
with
music
and
the
breath
of
a
delicious
perfume
and
the
dye
of
the
rich
forests
and
the
pastures
green
to
come
out
and
be
glad
i
would
not
stay
to
bind
my
gushing
spirit
with
a
book
fourteen
bright
summers
and
my
heart
had
grown
impatient
in
its
loneliness
and
for
something
that
was
like
itself
to
love
she
came
the
stately
isabel
as
proud
and
beautiful
and
gentle
as
my
dream
and
with
my
wealth
of
feeling
lov
i
her
older
by
years
and
wiser
of
the
world
she
was
in
thought
my
equal
and
we
the
pleasant
wood
together
and
sat
down
impassion
with
the
same
delicious
sweep
of
water
and
i
pour
into
her
ear
my
passion
and
my
hoarded
thoughts
like
one
till
i
forgot
that
there
was
any
world
but
isabel
and
nature
she
was
and
flatter
with
my
wild
and
earnest
love
and
suffer
my
delirious
words
to
burn
upon
my
lip
unchided
it
was
new
to
be
so
worshipped
like
a
deity
by
a
pure
heart
from
nature
and
she
gave
her
tenderness
its
way
and
when
i
her
fingers
till
i
thought
i
was
in
heaven
she
gaz
upon
me
silently
and
wept
i
have
seen
eighteen
summers
and
the
child
of
stately
isabel
hath
learn
to
come
and
win
me
from
my
sadness
i
have
my
feelings
to
affection
for
that
child
and
i
can
see
his
father
fondle
him
and
give
him
to
his
mother
with
a
kiss
upon
her
holy
forehead
and
be
calm
mere
accident
it
was
a
shady
nook
that
i
had
found
deep
in
the
greenwood
a
delicious
stream
ran
softly
by
it
on
a
bed
of
grass
and
to
the
border
leant
a
sloping
bank
of
moss
as
delicate
as
tempe
spread
for
the
sleep
of
io
overhead
the
spreading
larch
was
woven
with
the
fir
and
as
the
summer
wind
stole
listlessly
and
dallied
with
the
tree
tops
they
would
part
and
let
in
sprinklings
of
the
sunny
light
studding
the
moss
like
silver
and
again
returning
to
their
places
there
would
come
a
murmur
from
the
touched
and
stirring
leaves
that
like
a
instrument
beguiled
your
mood
into
the
idleness
of
sleep
here
did
i
win
thee
viola
we
came
thou
knowest
how
carelessly
and
never
thought
love
lived
in
such
a
wilderness
and
thou
i
had
a
cousin
kindness
for
thy
lip
and
in
the
meshes
of
thy
chesnut
hair
i
loved
to
hide
my
fingers
that
was
all
and
when
i
saw
thy
figure
on
the
grass
and
thy
straw
bonnet
flung
aside
i
thought
a
fairy
would
be
pretty
painted
so
upon
a
ground
of
green
but
that
was
all
and
when
thou
playfully
wouldst
bathe
thy
foot
and
the
clear
water
of
the
stream
ran
off
and
left
the
white
skin
polished
why
i
thought
it
looked
like
ivory
but
that
was
all
and
when
thou
wouldst
be
serious
and
i
was
serious
too
and
thy
mere
fairy
hand
lay
carelessly
in
mine
and
just
for
thought
i
mused
upon
thy
innocence
and
upon
the
pure
transparence
of
thy
brow
i
pressed
thy
fingers
half
unconsciously
and
fell
in
love
was
all
viola
the
earl
minstrel
i
had
a
passion
when
i
was
a
child
for
a
most
pleasant
idleness
in
june
when
the
thick
masses
of
the
leaves
were
with
a
just
audible
murmur
and
the
streams
fainted
in
their
cool
places
to
a
low
unnotic
tinkle
and
the
reapers
hung
their
sickles
in
the
trees
and
went
to
sleep
then
might
you
find
me
in
an
antique
chair
cushion
with
cunning
luxury
which
stood
in
the
old
study
corner
by
a
nook
crowded
with
volumes
of
the
old
romance
and
there
the
long
and
quiet
summer
day
lay
i
with
half
clos
eyelids
turning
leaf
after
leaf
until
the
twilight
their
singular
and
characters
was
a
forgetful
lore
and
it
is
blent
with
dreams
that
in
my
fitful
slumber
came
and
is
remember
faintly
but
with
the
strange
waywardness
of
human
thought
a
story
has
come
back
to
me
which
i
had
long
forgotten
and
i
tell
it
now
because
it
hath
a
savour
that
i
find
but
seldom
in
the
temper
of
the
world
angelo
turn
away
he
was
a
poor
unhonor
minstrel
and
he
might
not
breathe
love
to
the
daughter
of
an
earl
she
proudly
her
beautiful
head
and
shook
away
from
her
clear
temples
the
luxuriant
hair
and
told
him
it
would
ever
please
her
well
to
listen
to
his
minstrelsy
but
love
was
for
a
loftier
lip
and
then
the
tear
stole
to
her
flashing
eye
for
as
she
spoke
there
rose
up
a
remembrance
of
his
keen
unstooping
spirit
and
his
noble
heart
given
her
like
a
sacrifice
and
she
held
her
hand
for
him
to
kiss
and
said
farewell
think
of
me
angelo
and
so
pass
on
the
color
to
his
forehead
mounted
high
and
his
thin
lip
curl
haughtily
and
then
as
if
his
mood
had
chang
he
bow
his
head
low
on
his
bosom
and
remain
awhile
lost
in
his
bitter
thoughts
and
then
again
he
lifted
to
its
height
his
slender
form
and
his
moist
eye
grew
clear
and
his
hand
rapidly
his
instrument
while
thus
he
gave
his
spirit
voice
it
did
not
need
that
alter
look
nor
that
uplifted
brow
i
had
not
ask
thy
haughty
love
were
i
as
proud
as
now
my
love
was
like
a
beating
heart
unbidden
and
unstayed
and
had
i
known
but
half
its
power
it
had
not
been
betray
i
did
not
seek
thy
titled
hand
i
thought
not
of
thy
name
i
only
granted
utterance
to
one
wild
thought
of
flame
i
did
not
dream
thou
couldst
be
mine
or
i
a
thought
to
thee
i
only
knew
my
lip
must
let
some
burning
thought
go
free
i
lov
thee
for
thy
high
born
grace
thy
deep
and
lustrous
eye
for
the
sweet
meaning
of
thy
brow
and
for
thy
bearing
high
i
lov
thee
for
thy
stainless
truth
thy
thirst
for
higher
things
for
all
that
to
our
common
lot
a
better
temper
brings
and
are
they
not
all
thine
still
thine
is
not
thy
heart
as
true
holds
not
thy
step
its
noble
grace
thy
cheek
its
dainty
hue
and
have
i
not
an
ear
to
hear
a
cloudless
eye
to
see
and
a
thirst
for
beautiful
human
thought
that
first
was
stirr
with
thee
then
why
should
i
turn
from
thee
now
why
should
not
i
love
on
dreaming
of
thee
by
night
by
day
as
i
have
ever
done
my
service
shall
be
still
as
leal
my
love
as
quenchless
burn
it
shames
me
of
my
selfish
thought
that
dream
of
a
return
he
married
her
perhaps
it
spoils
the
tale
but
she
had
listen
to
his
song
unseen
and
kept
it
in
her
heart
and
by
and
by
when
angelo
did
service
for
his
king
and
was
prefer
to
honor
she
her
secret
in
some
delicate
way
that
i
do
not
remember
and
so
ends
the
tale
the
serenade
innocent
dreams
be
thine
the
silver
night
is
a
fit
curtain
for
thy
lovely
sleep
the
stars
keep
watch
above
thee
and
the
moon
sits
like
a
brooding
spirit
up
in
heaven
ruling
the
night
deep
influences
and
life
hath
a
hushed
pulse
and
the
suspended
leaves
sleep
with
their
whisperings
as
if
the
dew
were
a
soft
finger
on
the
lip
of
sound
innocent
dreams
be
thine
thy
heart
sends
up
its
thoughts
of
purity
like
pearly
bells
rising
in
crystal
fountains
and
the
sin
that
thou
hast
seen
by
day
will
like
a
shade
pass
from
thy
memory
as
if
the
pure
had
an
unconscious
ministry
by
night
midnight
and
now
for
music
would
i
were
a
sound
that
i
might
steal
upon
thy
dreams
and
like
the
breathing
of
my
flute
distil
sweetly
upon
thy
senses
softly
boy
breathe
the
low
cadences
as
if
the
words
fainted
upon
thy
lip
i
would
not
break
her
slumber
quite
but
only
as
she
dreams
witch
the
lull
sense
till
she
believes
she
hears
celestial
melody
song
sleep
like
a
lover
woo
thee
isabel
and
golden
dreams
come
to
thee
like
a
spell
by
some
sweet
angel
drawn
noiseless
hands
shall
seal
thy
slumber
setting
stars
its
moments
number
so
sleep
thou
on
the
night
above
thee
broodeth
hushed
and
deep
but
no
dark
thought
intrudeth
on
the
sleep
which
folds
thy
senses
now
gentle
spirits
float
around
thee
gentle
rest
hath
softly
bound
thee
for
pure
art
thou
and
now
thy
spirit
fleeth
on
rare
wings
and
fancy
vision
seeth
holy
things
in
its
high
atmosphere
music
strange
thy
sense
unsealeth
and
a
voice
to
thee
revealeth
what
angels
hear
wake
when
morning
breaketh
pure
and
calm
as
one
who
mourns
awaketh
when
the
balm
of
peace
hath
on
him
fell
purer
thoughts
shall
stir
within
thee
softer
cords
to
virtue
win
thee
farewell
farewell
hero
know
you
any
hero
none
my
lord
you
like
gentle
and
modest
hero
i
can
see
her
delicate
figure
and
her
soft
blue
eye
like
a
warm
vision
lovely
as
she
stood
veiled
in
the
presence
of
young
claudio
modesty
bows
her
head
and
that
young
heart
that
would
endure
all
suffering
for
the
love
it
hideth
is
as
tremulous
as
the
leaf
forsaken
of
the
summer
she
hath
flung
her
all
upon
the
venture
of
her
vow
and
in
her
trust
leans
meekly
like
a
flower
by
the
still
river
tempted
from
its
stem
and
on
its
bosom
floating
once
again
i
see
her
and
she
standeth
in
her
pride
with
her
soft
eye
enkindled
and
her
lip
curled
with
its
sweet
resentment
like
a
line
of
lifeless
coral
she
hath
heard
the
voice
that
was
her
music
utter
it
and
still
to
her
affection
faithful
she
hath
turned
and
questioned
in
her
innocent
unbelief
is
my
lord
well
that
he
should
speak
so
wide
how
did
they
look
upon
that
open
brow
and
not
read
purity
alas
for
truth
it
hath
so
many
counterfeits
the
words
that
to
a
child
were
written
legibly
are
by
the
wise
mistaken
and
when
light
hath
made
the
brow
transparent
and
the
face
is
like
an
angel
virtue
is
so
fair
they
read
it
like
an
leaf
and
break
the
heart
that
wrote
it
april
a
violet
by
a
mossy
stone
half
hidden
from
the
eye
fair
as
a
star
when
only
one
is
shining
in
the
sky
i
have
found
violets
april
hath
come
on
and
the
cool
winds
feel
softer
and
the
rain
falls
in
the
beaded
drops
of
summer
time
you
may
hear
birds
at
morning
and
at
eve
the
tame
dove
lingers
till
the
twilight
falls
cooing
upon
the
eaves
and
drawing
in
his
beautiful
bright
neck
and
from
the
hills
a
murmur
like
the
hoarseness
of
the
sea
tells
the
release
of
waters
and
the
earth
sends
up
a
pleasant
smell
and
the
dry
leaves
are
lifted
by
the
grass
and
so
i
know
that
nature
with
her
delicate
ear
hath
heard
the
dropping
of
the
velvet
foot
of
spring
smell
of
my
violets
i
found
them
where
the
liquid
south
stole
them
on
a
bank
that
lean
to
running
water
there
to
me
a
daintiness
about
these
early
flowers
that
touches
me
like
poetry
they
blow
with
such
a
simple
loveliness
among
the
common
herbs
of
pasture
and
breathe
out
their
lives
so
unobtrusively
like
hearts
whose
beatings
are
too
gentle
for
the
world
i
love
to
go
in
the
capricious
days
of
april
and
hunt
violets
when
the
rain
is
in
the
blue
cups
trembling
and
they
nod
so
gracefully
to
the
kisses
of
the
wind
it
may
be
deem
unmanly
but
the
wise
read
nature
like
the
manuscript
of
heaven
and
call
the
flowers
its
poetry
go
out
ye
spirits
of
habitual
unrest
and
read
it
when
the
fever
of
the
world
hath
made
your
hearts
impatient
and
if
life
hath
yet
one
spring
unpoison
it
will
be
like
a
beguiling
music
to
its
flow
and
you
will
no
more
wonder
that
i
love
to
hunt
for
violets
in
the
april
time
to
a
bride
pass
thou
on
for
the
vow
is
said
that
is
never
broken
the
hand
of
blessing
hath
trembling
laid
on
snowy
forehead
and
simple
braid
and
the
word
is
spoken
by
lips
that
never
their
words
betray
pass
thou
on
for
thy
human
all
is
richly
given
and
the
voice
that
claim
its
holy
thrall
must
be
sweeter
for
life
than
music
fall
and
this
side
heaven
thy
lip
may
never
that
trust
recal
pass
thou
on
yet
many
an
eye
will
droop
and
glisten
and
the
hushing
heart
in
vain
will
try
to
still
its
pulse
as
thy
step
goes
by
and
we
vainly
listen
for
thy
voice
of
witching
melody
pass
thou
on
yet
a
sister
tone
in
its
sweetness
lingers
like
some
twin
echo
sent
back
alone
or
the
bird
soft
note
when
its
mate
hath
flown
and
a
sister
fingers
will
again
the
thrilling
harp
be
thrown
and
our
eyes
will
rest
on
their
foreheads
fair
and
our
hearts
awaken
whenever
we
come
where
their
voices
are
but
oh
we
shall
think
how
musical
were
ere
of
thee
forsaken
the
mingled
voices
we
listed
there
pass
on
there
is
not
of
our
blessings
one
that
may
not
perish
like
visiting
angels
whose
errand
is
done
they
are
never
at
rest
till
their
home
is
won
and
we
may
not
cherish
the
beautiful
gift
of
light
pass
on
i
i
they
gaily
give
me
joy
as
if
i
should
be
glad
to
hear
that
i
was
less
a
boy
they
do
not
know
how
carelessly
their
words
have
given
pain
to
one
whose
heart
would
leap
to
be
a
happy
boy
again
i
had
a
light
and
careless
heart
when
this
brief
year
began
and
then
i
pray
that
i
might
be
a
grave
and
perfect
man
the
world
was
like
a
blessed
dream
of
joyous
coming
years
i
did
not
know
its
manliness
was
but
to
wake
in
tears
a
change
has
on
my
spirit
come
i
am
forever
sad
the
light
has
all
departed
now
my
early
feelings
had
i
used
to
love
the
morning
grey
the
twilight
quiet
deep
but
now
like
shadows
on
the
sea
upon
my
thoughts
they
creep
and
love
was
like
a
holy
star
when
this
brief
year
was
young
and
my
whole
worship
of
the
sky
on
one
sweet
ray
was
flung
but
worldly
things
have
come
between
and
shut
it
from
my
sight
and
though
the
star
shines
purely
yet
i
mourn
its
hidden
light
and
fame
i
bent
to
it
the
knee
and
bow
to
it
my
brow
and
it
is
like
a
coal
upon
my
living
spirit
now
but
when
i
pray
for
burning
fire
to
touch
the
soul
i
bow
i
did
not
know
the
lightning
flash
would
come
in
such
a
cloud
ye
give
me
joy
is
it
because
another
year
has
fled
that
i
am
farther
from
my
youth
and
nearer
to
the
dead
is
it
because
my
cares
have
come
my
happy
boyhood
because
the
visions
i
have
will
visit
me
no
more
oh
tell
me
not
that
ye
are
glad
i
can
not
smile
it
back
i
found
no
flower
and
seen
no
light
on
manhood
weary
track
my
love
is
deep
ambition
deep
and
heart
and
mind
on
but
love
is
fainting
by
the
way
and
fame
consumes
ere
won
on
a
picture
of
children
playing
by
fisher
i
love
to
look
on
a
scene
like
this
of
wild
and
careless
play
and
persuade
myself
that
i
am
not
old
and
my
locks
are
not
yet
gray
for
it
stirs
the
blood
in
old
man
heart
and
makes
his
pulses
fly
to
catch
the
thrill
of
a
happy
voice
and
the
light
of
a
pleasant
eye
i
have
walked
the
world
for
fourscore
years
and
they
say
that
i
am
old
that
my
heart
is
ripe
for
the
reaper
death
and
my
years
are
well
nigh
told
it
is
very
true
it
is
very
true
i
old
and
bide
my
time
but
my
heart
will
leap
at
a
scene
like
this
and
i
half
renew
my
prime
play
on
play
on
i
am
with
you
there
in
the
midst
of
your
merry
ring
i
can
feel
the
thrill
of
the
daring
jump
and
the
rush
of
the
breathless
swing
i
hide
with
you
in
the
fragrant
hay
and
i
whoop
the
smothered
call
and
my
feet
slip
up
on
the
seedy
floor
and
i
care
not
for
the
fall

they
take
thee

back

to

was

was
ever
so

till
i
learned
that
a
deeper
magic
lies
in
kissing
the
lids
of
her
closed
eyes
her
sweet
brow
i
seldom
touch
save
to
part
her
raven
hair
her
bright
cheek
i
gaze
on
much
her
white
hand
is
fair
but
none
of
these
i
tried
them
all
is
like
kissing
her
eyes
as
the
lashes
fall
the
solitary
alone
alone
how
drear
it
is
always
to
be
alone
in
such
a
depth
of
wilderness
the
only
thinking
one
the
waters
in
their
path
rejoice
the
trees
together
sleep
but
i
have
not
one
silver
voice
upon
my
ear
to
creep
the
sun
upon
the
silent
hills
his
mesh
of
beauty
weaves
there
music
in
the
laughing
rills
and
in
the
whispering
leaves
the
red
deer
like
the
breezes
fly
to
meet
the
bounding
roe
but
i
have
not
a
human
sigh
to
cheer
me
as
i
go
i
hated
men
i
hate
them
now
but
since
they
are
not
here
i
thirst
for
the
familiar
brow
thirst
for
the
stealing
tear
and
i
should
love
to
see
the
one
and
feel
the
other
creep
and
then
again
i
be
alone
amid
the
forest
deep
i
thought
that
i
should
love
my
hound
and
hear
my
cracking
gun
till
i
forgot
the
thrilling
sound
of
voices
one
by
one
i
thought
that
in
the
leafy
hush
of
nature
they
would
die
but
as
the
hindered
waters
rush
resisted
feelings
fly
i
weary
of
my
lonely
hut
and
of
its
blasted
tree
the
very
lake
is
like
my
lot
so
silent
constantly
i
lived
amid
the
forest
gloom
until
i
almost
fear
when
will
the
thrilling
voices
come
my
spirit
thirsts
to
hear
on
the
death
of
miss
fanny
apthorp
is
difficult
to
feel
that
she
is
dead
her
presence
like
the
shadow
of
a
wing
that
is
just
given
to
the
upward
sky
lingers
upon
us
we
can
hear
her
voice
and
for
her
step
we
listen
and
the
eye
looks
for
her
wonted
coming
with
a
strange
forgetful
earnestness
we
can
not
feel
that
she
will
no
more
come
that
from
her
cheek
the
delicate
flush
has
faded
and
the
light
dead
in
her
soft
dark
eye
and
on
her
lip
that
was
so
exquisitely
pure
the
dew
of
the
damp
grave
has
fallen
who
so
lov
is
left
among
the
living
who
hath
the
world
with
such
a
winning
loveliness
and
on
its
bright
brief
journey
gather
up
such
treasures
of
affection
she
was
only
as
idols
are
she
was
the
pride
of
her
familiar
sphere
the
daily
joy
of
all
who
on
her
gracefulness
might
gaze
and
in
the
light
and
music
of
her
way
have
a
companion
portion
who
could
feel
while
looking
upon
beauty
such
as
hers
that
it
would
ever
perish
it
is
like
the
melting
of
a
star
into
the
sky
while
you
are
gazing
on
it
or
a
dream
in
its
most
ravishing
sweetness
rudely
broken
a
portrait
she
was
not
very
beautiful
if
it
be
beauty
test
to
match
a
classic
model
when
perfectly
at
rest
and
she
did
not
look
bewitchingly
if
witchery
it
be
to
have
a
forehead
and
a
lip
transparent
as
the
sea
the
fashion
of
her
gracefulness
was
not
a
follow
rule
and
her
effervescent
sprightliness
was
never
learnt
at
school
and
her
words
were
all
peculiar
like
the
fairy
who
pearls
and
her
tone
was
ever
sweetest
midst
the
cadences
of
girls
said
i
she
was
not
beautiful
her
eyes
upon
your
sight
broke
with
the
lambent
purity
of
planetary
light
and
an
intellectual
beauty
like
a
light
within
a
vase
touched
every
line
with
glory
of
her
animated
face
her
mind
with
sweets
was
laden
like
a
morning
breath
in
june
and
her
thoughts
awoke
in
harmony
like
dreamings
of
a
tune
and
you
heard
her
words
like
voices
that
the
waters
creep
or
like
a
serenader
lute
that
mingles
with
your
sleep
she
had
an
earnest
intellect
a
perfect
thirst
of
mind
and
a
heart
by
elevated
thoughts
and
poetry
refin
and
she
saw
a
subtle
tint
or
shade
with
every
careless
look
and
the
hidden
links
of
nature
were
familiar
as
a
book
she
made
of
those
rare
elements
that
now
and
then
appear
as
if
remov
by
accident
unto
a
lesser
sphere
forever
reaching
up
and
on
to
life
sublimer
things
as
if
they
had
been
used
to
track
the
universe
with
wings
may
oh
the
merry
may
has
pleasant
hours
and
dreamily
they
glide
as
if
they
floated
like
the
leaves
upon
a
silver
tide
the
trees
are
full
of
crimson
buds
and
the
woods
are
full
of
birds
and
the
waters
flow
to
music
like
a
tune
with
pleasant
words
the
verdure
of
the
is
creeping
to
the
hills
the
sweet
violets
are
blowing
by
the
rills
the
lilac
has
a
load
of
balm
for
every
wind
that
stirs
and
the
larch
stands
green
and
beautiful
amid
the
sombre
firs
there
perfume
upon
every
wind
music
in
every
tree
dews
for
the
flowers
sweets
for
the
sucking
bee
the
sick
come
forth
for
the
healing
south
the
young
are
gathering
flowers
and
life
is
a
tale
of
poetry
that
is
told
by
golden
hours
if
is
not
a
true
philosophy
that
the
spirit
when
set
free
still
lingers
about
its
olden
home
in
the
flower
and
the
tree
it
is
very
strange
that
our
pulses
thrill
at
the
tint
of
a
voiceless
thing
and
our
hearts
yearn
so
with
tenderness
in
the
beautiful
time
of
spring
on
seeing
through
a
distant
window
a
belle
completing
her
toilet
for
a
ball
is
well
is
well
that
clustering
shade
is
on
thy
forehead
sweetly
laid
and
that
light
curl
that
slumbers
by
makes
deeper
yet
thy
depth
of
eye
and
that
white
rose
that
decks
thy
hair
just
wins
the
eye
to
linger
there
yet
makes
it
not
to
note
the
less
the
beauty
of
that
raven
tress
thy
coral
necklace
too
nay
nay
not
them
no
darker
hue
than
thy

bosom

on

neck
the
bar
of
light
or
hide
the
veins
that
faintly
glow
and
wander
in
its
living
snow
what
yet
another
can
it
be
that
neck
needs
ornament
to
thee
yet
not
thy
jewels
they
are
bright
but
that
dark
eye
has
softer
light
and
tho
each
gem
had
been
a
star
thy
simple
self
were
lovelier
far
yet

string
of
matchless
pearl
nay

thee

at

gay
ball
and
that
proud
toss
it
makes
thee
smile
to
see
how
deep
is
thine
own
wile
and
that
slow
look
that
seems
to
stray
as
each
sweet
feature
made
it
stay
and
that
small
finger
lightly
laid
on
dimpled
cheek
and
glossy
braid
as
if

know
that

they
seem
is
really
there

wrought

this
night
bewilder

thrillingly
and
sensibly
do
feel

ear
doth
hear

meet
thee
in

festal
hall
i
turn
thee
in

dance
and
i
wait
as

is
as
undenied
as

and
thy

beats
just
as
equally
thy
praises
are

so
long
without

hath
shone

and
thine

weal
thy
thoughts
are
deeper
than
a
dream
and
holier
than
gay
and
thy
mind
is
a
harp
of
gentle
strings
where
angel
fingers
play
i
know
all
this
i
feel
all
this
and
my
heart
believes
it
true
and
my
fancy
hath
often
borne
me
on
as
a

do

i
have
a
heart
that
is
strong
and
deep
and
would
love

its
human
all

it
waits
for
a
fetter

sweet

wear

bound
to

thrall

bind
its

worship

to
all
the

in

in
thine

humble
in
all
but
the
queenly
brow
and
to
thine
own
glory
blind
were
the
world
to
prove
but
a
faithless
thing
and
worshippers
leave
thy
shrine
my
love
were
then
but
a
gift
for
thee
and
my
strong
deep
heart
were
thine
a
portrait
she
beautiful
her
raven
curls
have
broken
hearts
in
envious
girls
and
then
they
sleep
in
contrast
so
like
raven
feathers
upon
snow
and
bathe
her
neck
and
shade
the
bright
dark
eye
from
which
they
catch
the
light
as
if
their
graceful
loops
were
made
to
keep
that
glorious
eye
in
shade
and
holier
make
its
tranquil
spell
like
waters
in
a
shaded
well
i
can
not
rhyme
about
that
eye
i
match
it
with
a
midnight
sky
i
said
was
deep
and
dark
and
wild
expressive
liquid
witching
mild
but
the
jewell
star
and
the
living
air
have
nothing
in
them
half
so
fair
she
noble
noble
one
to
keep
embalm
for
dreams
of
fever
sleep
an
eye
for
nature
taste
refin
perception
swift
and
ballanc
mind
and
more
than
all
a
gift
of
thought
to
such
a
wrought
that
on
my
ear
her
language
fell
as
if
each
word
dissolv
a
spell
yet
i
half
hate
her
she
has
all
that
would
ensure
an
angel
fall
but
there
a
cool
collected
look
as
if
her
pulses
beat
by
book
a
measure
tone
a
cold
reply
a
management
of
voice
and
eye
a
calm
possess
authentic
air
that
leaves
a
doubt
of
softness
there
look
and
worship
as
i
may
my
fever
thoughts
will
pass
away
and
when
she
lifts
her
fringing
lashes
and
her
dark
eye
like
flashes
and
when
she
plays
her
quiet
wile
of
that
calm
look
and
measur
smile
i
go
away
like
one
who
heard
in
some
fine
scene
the
prompter
word
and
make
a
vow
to
break
her
chain
and
keep
it
till
we
meet
again
