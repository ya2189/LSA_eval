times

i
cut
my
teeth
and
took
to
fun
i
learned
what
not
to
be
afraid
of
and
what
stuff
lips
are
made
of
i
learned
with
what
a
rosy
feeling
good
ale
makes
floors
seem
like
the
ceiling
and
how
the
moon
gives
shiny
light
to
lads
as
roll
home
singing
my
blood
did
leap
my
flesh
did
revel
saul
kane
was
tokened
to
the
devil
from
to
i
lived
in
disbelief
of
heaven
i
drunk
i
fought
i
poached
i
whored
i
did
despite
unto
the
lord
i
cursed
make
a
man
look
pale
and
nineteen
times
i
went
to
jail
now
friends
observe
and
look
upon
me
mark
how
the
lord
took
pity
on
me
by
dead
thorn
while
setting
wires
who
should
come
up
but
billy
myers
a
friend
of
mine
who
used
to
be
as
black
a
sprig
of
hell
as
me
with
whom
planned
to
save
which
fields
and
coverts
each
should
poach
in
now
when
he
saw
me
set
my
snare
he
tells
me
to
hell
from
there
this
field
is
mine
he
says
right
if
you
poach
here
be
a
fight
out
now
he
says
leave
your
wire
closhy
bloody
is
my
is
my
ruler
fight
you
for
by
damn
not
now
though
my
thumb
fight
after
the
harvest
hum
and
silas
jones
that
bookie
wide
will
make
a
purse
five
pounds
a
those
were
the
words
that
was
the
place
by
which
god
brought
me
into
grace
on
wood
top
field
the
peewits
go
mewing
and
wheeling
ever
so
and
like
the
shaking
of
a
timbrel
cackles
the
laughter
of
the
whimbrel
in
the
old
they
say
pike
was
made
away
he
walks
pike
for
harm
he
taps
the
windows
of
the
farm
the
blood
drips
from
his
broken
chin
he
taps
and
begs
to
be
let
in
on
wood
top
nights
shaked
to
hark
the
peewits
wambling
in
the
dark
lest
in
the
dark
the
old
man
might
creep
up
to
me
to
beg
a
light
but
wood
top
grass
is
short
and
sweet
and
springy
to
a
feet
at
harvest
hum
the
moon
so
bright
did
shine
on
wood
top
for
the
fight
when
bill
was
stripped
down
to
his
bends
i
thought
how
long
we
been
friends
and
in
my
mind
about
that
wire
i
thought
right
i
am
a
liar
as
sure
as
made
in
prison
the
right
to
poach
that
copse
is
have
no
luck
thinks
i
fighting
to
defend
a
lie
and
this
moonshiny
fun
is
worse
than
aught
i
ever
and
thinking
that
way
my
heart
bled
so
i
almost
stept
to
bill
and
said
so
and
now
dead
i
would
be
glad
if
i
could
only
think
i
had
but
no
i
put
the
thought
away
for
fear
of
what
my
friends
would
say
backed
me
see
o
lord
the
sin
done
for
the
things
money
in
the
stakes
were
drove
the
ropes
were
hitched
into
the
ring
my
hat
i
pitched
my
corner
faced
the
park
just
where
the
make
it
dark
the
place
where
i
begun
poor
nell
upon
the
road
to
hell
i
thought
oft
sitting
in
my
corner
after
the
struck
his
warner
two
brandy
flasks
for
fear
of
noise
clinked
out
the
time
to
us
two
boys
and
while
my
seconds
chafed
and
gloved
me
i
thought
of
eyes
when
she
loved
me
and
wondered
how
my
tot
would
end
first
nell
cast
off
and
now
my
friend
and
in
the
moonlight
dim
and
wan
i
knew
quite
well
my
luck
was
gone
and
looking
round
i
felt
a
spite
at
all
come
to
see
me
fight
the
five
and
forty
human
faces
inflamed
by
drink
and
going
to
races
faces
of
men
never
been
merry
or
true
or
live
or
clean
never
felt
the
trim
of
brain
divinely
knit
to
limb
nor
felt
the
whole
live
body
go
one
tingling
health
from
top
to
toe
nor
took
a
punch
nor
given
a
swing
but
just
soaked
deady
round
the
ring
until
their
brains
and
bloods
were
foul
enough
to
make
their
throttles
howl
while
we
whom
jesus
died
to
teach
fought
round
on
round
three
minutes
each
and
thinking
that
understand
i
thought
go
and
take
hand
up
and
say
the
fault
was
mine
he
make
play
for
these
here
and
then
i
thought
that
that
was
silly
think
i
was
afraid
of
billy
think
i
thought
it
god
forgive
me
i
funked
the
hiding
bill
could
give
me
and
that
thought
made
me
mad
and
hot
that
will
they
well
they
shall
not
they
think
that
i
will
not
damned
if
i
will
i
will
time
from
the
beginning
of
the
bout
my
luck
was
gone
my
hand
was
out
right
from
the
start
bill
called
the
play
but
i
was
quick
and
kept
away
till
the
fourth
round
when
work
got
mixed
and
then
i
knew
bill
had
me
fixed
my
hand
was
out
why
heaven
knows
bill
punched
me
when
and
where
he
chose
through
two
more
rounds
we
quartered
wide
and
all
the
time
my
hands
seemed
tied
bill
punched
me
when
and
where
he
pleased
the
cheering
from
my
backers
ceased
but
every
punch
i
heard
a
yell
of
the
style
bill
give
him
no
one
for
me
but
light
left
straight
left
and
his
i
know
how
a
boxer
goes
when
all
his
body
hums
from
blows
i
know
i
seemed
to
rock
and
spin
i
know
how
i
saved
my
chin
i
know
i
thought
my
only
friend
was
that
clinked
flask
at
each
end
when
my
two
seconds
ed
and
jimmy
had
sixty
seconds
help
to
gim
me
but
in
the
ninth
with
pain
and
knocks
i
stopped
i
fight
nor
box
bill
missed
his
swing
the
light
was
tricky
but
i
went
down
and
stayed
down
dicky
up
cried
jim
i
said
then
all
the
gang
yelled
him
bill
out
bill
rushed
and
clink
clink
clink
time
and
knee
and
rum
to
drink
and
round
the
ring
there
ran
a
titter
by
the
call
the
bloody
they
drove
a
dodge
that
never
fails
a
pin
beneath
my
finger
nails
they
poured
what
seemed
a
running
beck
of
cold
spring
water
down
my
neck
jim
with
a
lancet
quick
as
flies
lowered
the
swellings
round
my
eyes
they
sluiced
my
legs
and
fanned
my
face
through
all
that
blessed
grace
they
gave
my
calves
a
thorough
kneading
they
salved
my
cuts
and
stopped
the
bleeding
a
gulp
of
liquor
dulled
the
pain
and
then
the
two
flasks
clinked
again
time
there
was
bill
as
grim
as
death
he
rushed
i
clinched
to
get
more
breath
and
breath
i
got
though
billy
bats
some
stinging
in
my
slats
and
when
we
broke
as
i
foresaw
he
swung
his
right
in
for
the
jaw
i
stopped
it
on
my
shoulder
bone
and
at
the
shock
i
heard
bill
groan
a
little
groan
or
moan
or
grunt
as
though
hit
his
wind
a
bunt
at
that
i
clinched
and
while
we
clinched
his
dig
was
flinched
and
when
we
broke
he
hit
me
light
as
though
he
trust
his
right
he
flapped
me
somehow
with
his
wrist
as
though
he
use
his
fist
and
when
he
hit
he
winced
with
pain
i
thought
sprained
crocked
so
i
got
strength
and
bill
gave
ground
and
that
round
was
an
easy
round
during
the
wait
my
jimmy
said
making
billy
fight
so
dead
all
to
pieces
is
he
blown
then
your
own
all
your
own
but
be
rash
got
the
goods
if
got
cash
and
what
one
hand
can
do
do
be
careful
this
next
round
or
time
there
was
bill
and
i
felt
sick
that
luck
should
play
so
mean
a
trick
and
give
me
leave
to
knock
him
out
after
plainly
won
the
bout
but
by
the
way
the
man
came
at
me
he
made
it
plain
he
meant
to
bat
me
if
a
seen
the
way
he
come
you
think
crocked
a
thumb
with
all
his
skill
and
all
his
might
he
clipped
me
dizzy
left
and
right
the
lord
knows
what
the
effort
cost
but
he
was
mad
to
think
lost
and
knowing
nothing
else
could
save
him
he
care
what
pain
it
gave
him
he
called
the
music
and
the
dance
for
five
rounds
more
and
gave
no
chance
try
to
imagine
if
you
can
the
kind
of
manhood
in
the
man
and
if
like
to
feel
his
pain
you
sprain
your
thumb
and
hit
the
sprain
and
hit
it
hard
with
all
your
power
on
something
hard
for
while
someone
thumps
you
black
and
blue
and
then
know
what
billy
knew
bill
took
that
pain
without
a
sound
till
through
the
eighteenth
round
and
then
i
sent
him
down
and
out
and
silas
said
wins
the
when
bill
came
to
you
understand
i
ripped
the
mitten
from
my
hand
and
went
across
to
ask
bill
shake
my
limbs
were
all
one
pain
and
ache
i
was
so
weary
and
so
sore
i
think
a
stood
much
more
bill
in
his
corner
bathed
his
thumb
buttoned
his
shirt
and
glowered
glum
never
shake
your
hand
he
said
rather
see
my
children
dead
been
about
and
had
some
fun
with
you
but
a
liar
and
done
with
you
knocked
me
out
you
beat
me
look
out
the
next
time
that
you
meet
me
be
no
friend
to
watch
the
clock
for
you
and
no
convenient
thumb
to
crock
for
you
and
take
care
with
much
delight
get
what
a
got
that
puts
my
meaning
clear
i
guess
now
get
to
hell
i
want
to
i
dressed
my
backers
one
and
all
said
done
you
or
old
saul
is
a
wonder
and
a
fly
you
have
saul
at
the
lion
with
merry
oaths
they
helped
me
down
the
stony
to
the
town
the
moonlight
shone
on
cabbage
walk
it
made
the
limestone
look
like
chalk
it
was
too
late
for
any
people
twelve
struck
as
we
went
by
the
steeple
a
dog
barked
and
an
owl
was
calling
the
brook
was
still
the
carved
heads
on
the
church
looked
down
on
blacksmith
of
this
town
and
all
the
graves
of
all
the
ghosts
who
rise
on
christmas
eve
in
hosts
to
dance
and
carol
in
festivity
for
joy
of
jesus
nativity
dawe
and
his
two
sons
beheld
from
the
once
two
and
two
about
about
singing
the
end
of
advent
out
dwindling
down
to
windlestraws
when
the
glittering
peacock
craws
as
craw
the
glittering
peacock
should
when
own
star
comes
over
the
wood
lamb
of
the
sky
come
out
of
fold
wandering
windy
heavens
cold
so
they
shone
and
sang
till
twelve
when
all
the
bells
ring
out
of
theirselve
rang
a
peal
for
christmas
morn
glory
men
for
christ
is
born
all
the
old
singing
places
glimmered
quick
with
flitting
faces
singing
anthems
singing
hymns
under
carven
cherubims
ringer
dawe
aloft
could
mark
faces
at
the
window
dark
crowding
crowding
row
on
row
till
all
the
church
began
to
glow
the
chapel
glowed
the
nave
the
choir
all
the
faces
became
fire
below
the
eastern
window
high
to
see
star
come
up
the
sky
then
they
lifted
hands
and
turned
and
all
their
lifted
fingers
burned
burned
like
the
golden
altar
tallows
burned
like
a
troop
of
own
hallows
bringing
to
mind
the
burning
time
when
all
the
bells
will
rock
and
chime
and
burning
saints
on
burning
horses
will
sweep
the
planets
from
their
courses
and
loose
the
stars
to
burn
up
night
lord
give
us
eyes
to
bear
the
light
we
all
went
quiet
down
the
scallenge
lest
police
inspector
drew
should
challenge
but
drew
was
sleeping
sweet
his
head
upon
a
charges
sheet
under
the
flaring
full
snorting
and
snoring
like
a
bull
his
bull
cheeks
puffed
his
bull
lips
blowing
his
ugly
yellow
front
teeth
showing
just
as
we
peeped
we
saw
him
fumble
and
scratch
his
head
and
shift
and
mumble
down
in
the
lane
so
thin
and
dark
the
stank
of
bitter
bark
the
pigeons
gave
a
flutter
a
cat
went
courting
down
the
gutter
and
none
else
stirred
a
foot
or
feather
the
houses
put
their
heads
together
talking
perhaps
so
dark
and
sly
of
all
the
folk
seen
go
by
children
and
men
and
women
merry
all
some
day
pass
that
way
to
burial
it
was
all
dark
but
at
the
turning
the
lion
had
a
window
burning
so
in
we
went
and
up
the
stairs
treading
as
still
as
cats
and
hares
the
way
the
stairs
creaked
made
you
wonder
if
dead
bones
were
hidden
under
at
head
of
stairs
upon
the
landing
a
woman
with
a
lamp
was
standing
she
greet
each
gent
at
head
of

liver

was
nodding
to
the
floor
and
gurgling
as
he
wanted
more
his
mouth
was
wide
his
face
was
pale
his
swollen
face
was
sweating
ale
and
one
of
those
assembled
greeks
had
corked
black
crosses
on

all
eaten

a
crust
with

wrecked
for

we
spat
and
smoked
and
took
our
swipe
till

pay
attention
because

things

and
had
a
french

him

bloody
burn
his
bloody
from
three
long
hours
of
gin
and
smokes
and
two
breath
and
fifteen
a
warmish
night
and
windows
shut
the
room
stank
like
a
gut
the
heat
and
smell
and
drinking
deep
began
to
stun
the
gang
to
sleep
some
fell
downstairs
to
sleep
on
the
mat
some
snored
it
sodden
where
they
sat
dick
twot
had
lost
a
tooth
and
wept
but
all
the
drunken
others
slept
jane
slept
beside
me
in
the
chair
and
i
got
up
i
wanted
air
i
opened
window
wide
and
leaned
out
of
that
pigstye
of
the
fiend
and
felt
a
cool
wind
go
like
grace
about
the
sleeping
the
clock
struck
three
and
sweetly
slowly
the
bells
chimed
holy
holy
holy
and
in
a
pause
there
fell
the
cold
note
of
the
chapel
bell
and
then
a
cock
crew
flapping
wings
and
summat
made
me
think
of
things
how
long
those
ticking
clocks
had
gone
from
church
and
chapel
on
and
on
ticking
the
time
out
ticking
slow
to
men
and
girls
come
and
go
and
how
they
ticked
in
belfry
dark
when
half
the
town
was
park
and
how
rung
a
chime
full
tilt
the
night
after
the
church
was
built
and
how
that
night
was
feast
the
night
fought
and
been
a
beast
and
how
a
change
had
come
and
then
i
thought
tick
to
different
what
with
the
fight
and
what
with
drinking
and
being
awake
alone
there
thinking
my
mind
began
to
carp
and
tetter
this
all
the
beasts
are
and
then
i
thought
wish
seen
the
many
towns
this
town
has
been
i
wish
i
knew
if
a
kind
of
summat
if
them
as
built
the
church
so
fair
were
half
the
chaps
folk
say
they
were
for
the
skill
to
draw
their
plan
and
a
joy
to
any
man
and
the
strength
not
skill
alone
to
build
it
beautiful
in
stone
and
strength
and
skill
together
thus
o
they
were
happier
men
than
us
if
they
were
they
had
to
die
the
same
as
every
one
and
i
and
no
one
lives
again
but
dies
and
all
the
bright
goes
out
of
eyes
and
all
the
skill
goes
out
of
hands
and
all
the
wise
brain
understands
and
all
the
beauty
all
the
power
is
cut
down
like
a
withered
flower
in
all
the
show
from
birth
to
rest
i
give
the
poor
dumb
cattle
i
wondered
then
why
life
should
be
and
what
would
be
the
end
of
me
when
youth
and
health
and
strength
were
gone
and
cold
old
age
came
creeping
on
a
gun
the
union
ward
or
that
new
quod
at
hereford
and
looking
round
i
felt
disgust
at
all
the
nights
of
drink
and
lust
and
all
the
looks
of
all
the
swine
said
that
they
were
friends
of
mine
and
yet
i
knew
when
morning
came
the
morning
would
be
just
the
same
for
have
drinks
and
jane
would
meet
me
and
drunken
silas
jones
would
greet
me
and
risk
quod
and
gun
till
all
the
silly
game
was
done
parson
chaps
are
mad
a
chap
can
change
the
road
and
then
the
devil
whispered
why
should
you
want
to
live
at
all
why
fret
and
sweat
and
try
to
mend
all
the
same
thing
in
the
end
but
when
done
he
said
ended
why
stand
it
since
it
be
mended
and
in
my
heart
i
heard
him
plain
yourself
down
and
end
it
not
said
i
not
but
no
i
never
had
my
go
not
had
all
the
world
can
give
death
by
and
by
but
first
live
the
world
owes
me
my
time
of
times
and
that
coming
now
by
a
madness
took
me
then
i
felt
like
to
hit
the
world
a
belt
i
felt
that
i
could
fly
through
air
a
screaming
star
with
blazing
hair
a
rushing
comet
crackling
numbing
the
folk
with
fear
of
judgment
coming
a
in
a
fiery
car
coming
to
tell
folk
what
they
are
what
do
i
shouted
loud
tell
this
sanctimonious
crowd
this
town
of
prying
maligning
peering
hinting
lying
male
and
female
human
blots
who
would
but
be
whores
and
sots
that
so
steeped
in
petty
vice
that
less
excellent
than
lice
that
so
soaked
in
petty
virtue
that
touching
one
of
them
will
dirt
you
dirt
you
with
the
stain
of
mean
cheating
trade
and
going
between
pinching
starving
scraping
hoarding
spying
through
the
chinks
of
boarding
to
see
if
sue
the
prentice
lean
dares
to
touch
the
margarine
fawning
cringing
oiling
boots
raging
in
the
pursuits
flinging
stones
at
all
the
stephens
standing
firm
with
all
the
evens
making
hell
for
all
the
odd
all
the
lonely
ones
of
god
those
poor
lonely
ones
who
find
dogs
more
mild
than
human
kind
for
dogs
i
said
nobles
born
to
most
of
you
you
cockled
corn
known
dogs
to
leave
their
dinner
nosing
a
kind
heart
in
a
sinner
poor
old
crafty
wagged
his
tail
the
day
i
first
came
home
from
jail
when
all
my
folk
so
primly
clad
glowered
black
and
thought
me
mad
and
muttered
how
been
respected
while
i
was
what
all
expected
thought
of
that
old
dog
for
years
and
of
how
near
i
come
to
tears
you
you
minds
of
bread
and
cheese
are
less
divine
than
that
fleas
you
suck
blood
from
kindly
friends
and
kill
them
when
it
serves
your
ends
double
traitors
double
black
stabbing
only
in
the
back
stabbing
with
the
knives
you
borrow
from
the
friends
you
bring
to
sorrow
you
stab
all
true
and
strong
truth
and
strength
you
say
are
wrong
meek
and
mild
and
sweet
and
creeping
repeating
canting
cadging
peeping
the
art
and
the
life
to
win
a
man
his
wife
all
good
and
all
true
you
kill
that
so
kill
at
that
i
tore
my
clothes
in
shreds
and
hurled
them
on
the
window
leads
i
flung
my
boots
through
both
the
winders
and
knocked
the
glass
to
little
flinders
the
punch
bowl
and
the
tumblers
followed
and
then
i
seized
the
lamps
and
holloed
and
down
the
stairs
and
tore
back
bolts
as
mad
as
twenty
blooded
colts
and
out
into
the
street
i
pass
as
mad
as
at
grass
a
naked
madman
waving
grand
a
blazing
lamp
in
either
hand
i
yelled
like
twenty
drunken
sailors
come
among
the
a
blaze
of
flame
behind
me
streamed
and
then
i
clashed
the
lamps
and
screamed
satan
newly
come
from
and
then
i
spied
the
been
a
ringer
so
i
know
how
best
to
make
a
big
bell
go
so
on
to
swift
i
swoop
and
stick
my
one
foot
in
the
loop
and
heave
a
till
i
groan
you
swine
you
i
made
the
awake
i
felt
the
throb
and
shake
i
felt
the
air
mingle
and
clang
and
beat
the
walls
a
muffled
bang
and
stifle
back
and
boom
and
bay
like
muffled
peals
on
boxing
day
and
then
surge
up
and
gather
shape
and
spread
great
pinions
and
escape
and
each
great
bird
of
clanging
shrieks
o
fire
fire
from
iron
beaks
my
shoulders
cracked
to
send
around
those
shrieking
birds
made
out
of
sound
with
news
of
fire
in
their
bills
they
heard
plain
beyond
wall

up
go
the
winders
out

i
heard
the
springs

creak
in

a
taking
thought
the
bloody
earth
was
quaking
and
others
come
and
spread
a
tale
of
out
of
gloucester
jail
and
how
we
needed
extra
cops
with
all
them
welsh
come
picking
hops
with
drunken
welsh
in
all
our
sheds
we
might
be
murdered
in
our
beds
by
all
accounts
both
men
and
wives
had
had
the
scare
up
of
their
lives
i
ate
and
drank
and
gathered
strength
and
stretched
along
the
bench
full
length
or
crossed
to
window
seat
to
pat
black
silas
little
cat
at
four
i
called
own
the
second
trumpet
shall
be
blown
the
second
trump
the
second
blast
flames
are
loosed
and
passed
too
late
for
mercy
now
take
warning
death
and
hell
and
judgment
i
hurled
the
bench
into
the
settle
i
banged
the
table
on
the
kettle
i
sent
quart
of
cider
spinning
here
begins
my
second
each
bottle
mug
and
jug
and
pot
i
smashed
to
crocks
in
half
a
tot
and
joe
and
si
and
nick
and
percy
i
rolled
together
topsy
versy
and
as
i
ran
i
heard
call
damn
to
hell
gone
with
saul
out
into
street
i
ran
uproarious
the
devil
dancing
in
me
glorious
and
as
i
ran
i
yell
and
shriek
on
now
turn
the
other
across
the
way
by
almshouse
pump
i
see
old
puffing
parson
stump
old
parson
as
a
ferret
from
nightly
wrestlings
with
the
spirit
i
ran
across
and
barred
his
path
his
turkey
gills
went
red
as
wrath
and
then
he
froze
as
parsons
can
police
will
deal
with
you
my
yet
said
i
yet
they
and
now
hear
me
like
or
the
english
church
both
is
and
was
a
subsidy
of
caiaphas
i
believe
in
prayer
nor
bible
lies
all
through
and
a
libel
a
libel
on
the
plan
when
first
he
miscreated
man
you
mumble
through
a
formal
code
to
get
which
martyrs
burned
and
glowed
i
look
on
martyrs
as
mistakes
but
still
they
burned
for
it
at
stakes
your
only
the
jolly
fire
where
you
can
guzzle
port
with
squire
and
back
and
praise
his
damned
opinions
about
his
temporal
dominions
you
let
him
give
the
man
who
digs
a
filthy
hut
unfit
for
pigs
without
a
well
without
a
drain
with
mossy
thatch
that
lets
in
rain
without
a
he
rent
it
and
never
meat
unless
he
scent
it
but
weekly
doles
of
shilling
to
make
a
grown
man
strong
and
willing
to
do
the
hardest
work
on
earth
and
feed
his
wife
when
she
gives
birth
and
feed
his
little
bones
i
tell
you
man
the
devil
groans
with
all
your
main
and
all
your
might
you
back
what
is
against
right
you
let
the
squire
do
things
like
these
you
back
him
and
give
him
ease
you
take
his
hand
and
drink
his
wine
and
a
hog
but
a
swine
for
you
take
gold
to
teach
ways
and
teach
man
how
to
sing
praise
and
now
tell
you
what
you
teach
in
downright
honest
english
speech
teach
the
starving
man
that
plan
you
get
his
learning
circumvented
lest
it
should
make
him
discontented
better
a
brutal
starving
nation
than
men
with
thoughts
above
their
station
you
let
him
neither
read
nor
think
you
goad
his
wretched
soul
to
drink
and
then
to
jail
the
drunken
boor
o
sad
intemperance
of
the
poor
you
starve
his
soul
till
rapscallion
then
blame
his
flesh
for
being
stallion
you
send
your
wife
around
to
paint
the
golden
glories
of
restraint
how
moral
exercise
would
soon
result
in
fewer
children
you
work
a
day
in
fields
and
see
what
sweet
restraint
it
yields
a
day
at
turnip
picking
your
too
fat
for
plough
or
ricking
you
whom
luck
taught
french
and
greek
have
purple
flaps
on
either
cheek
a
stately
house
and
time
for
knowledge
and
gold
to
send
your
sons
to
college
that
pleasant
place
where
getting
learning
is
also
key
to
money
earning
but
quite
your
want
of
grace
is
what
you
do
to
save
your
face
the
way
you
sit
astride
the
gates
by
padding
wages
out
of
rates
your
christmas
gifts
of
shoddy
blankets
that
every
working
soul
may
thank
its
loving
parson
loving
squire
through
whom
he
afford
a
fire
your
bench
your
prison
pen
to
keep
them
something
less
than
men
your
friendly
clubs
to
help
bury
your
charities
of
midwifery
your
bidding
children
duck
and
cap
to
them
who
give
them
workhouse
pap
o
what
you
are
and
what
you
preach
and
what
you
do
and
what
you
teach
is
not
word
nor
honest
schism
but
cant
and
by
this
time
many
folk
had
gathered
to
listen
to
me
while
i
blathered
i
said
my
piece
and
when
said
it
do
old
purple
parson
credit
he
sunk
as
sometimes
parsons
can
his
excuses
in
the
man
think
that
squire
and
i
are
kings
who
made
the
existing
state
of
things
and
made
it
ill
i
answer
no
states
are
not
made
nor
patched
they
grow
grow
slow
through
centuries
of
pain
and
grow
correctly
in
the
main
but
only
grow
by
certain
laws
of
certain
bits
in
certain
jaws
you
want
to
doctor
that
let
be
you
can
not
patch
a
growing
tree
put
these
two
words
beneath
your
hat
these
two
securus
judicat
the
social
states
of
human
kinds
are
made
by
multitudes
of
minds
and
after
multitudes
of
years
a
little
human
growth
appears
worth
having
even
to
the
soul
who
sees
most
plain
not
the
whole
this
state
is
dull
and
evil
both
i
keep
it
in
the
path
of
growth
you
think
the
church
an
outworn
fetter
kane
keep
it
till
built
a
better
and
keep
the
existing
social
state
i
quite
agree
out
of
date
one
does
too
much
another
shirks
unjust
i
grant
but
still
it
works
to
get
the
whole
world
out
of
bed
and
washed
and
dressed
and
warmed
and
fed
to
work
and
back
to
bed
again
believe
me
saul
costs
worlds
of
pain
then
as
to
whether
true
or
sham
that
book
of
christ
whose
priest
i
am
the
bible
is
a
lie
say
you
where
do
you
stand
suppose
it
true
but
if
more
to
say
my
doors
are
open
night
and
day
meanwhile
my
friend
be
no
sin
to
mix
more
water
in
your
gin
neither
saints
nor
philip
sidneys
but
mortal
men
with
mortal
he
took
his
snuff
and
wheezed
a
greeting
and
waddled
off
to
meeting
i
hung
my
head
upon
my
chest
i
give
old
purple
parson
best
for
while
the
plough
tips
round
the
pole
the
trained
mind
outs
the
upright
soul
as
jesus
said
the
trained
mind
might
being
wiser
than
the
sons
of
light
but
trained
minds
are
spread
so
thin
they
let
all
sorts
of
darkness
in
whatever
light
man
finds
they
doubt
it
they
love
not
light
but
talk
about
it
but
proved
to
eyes
that
i
was
drunk
and
he
was
wise
and
people
grinned
and
women
tittered
and
little
children
mocked
and
twittered
so
blazing
mad
i
stalked
to
bar
to
show
how
noble
drunkards
are
and
guzzled
spirits
like
a
beast
to
show
contempt
for
church
and
priest
until
by
six
my
wits
went
round
like
hungry
pigs
in
parish
pound
at
six
jane
i
staggered
into
street
again
with
mind
made
up
or
primed
with
gin
to
bash
the
cop
run
me
in
for
well
i
knew
have
to
cock
up
my
legs
that
night
inside
the
and
it
was
my
most
fixed
intent
to
have
a
fight
before
i
went
our
fates
are
strange
and
no
one
knows
his
our
lovely
saviour
christ
disposes
jane
where
planned
the
jade
thought
me
drunk
and
stayed
so
i
went
up
the
walk
to
look
for
her
and
lingered
by
the
little
brook
for
her
and
dowsed
my
face
and
drank
at
spring
and
watched
two
wild
duck
on
the
wing
the
moon
come
pale
the
wind
come
cool
a
big
pike
leapt
in
lower
pool
the
peacock
screamed
the
clouds
were
straking
my
cut
cheek
felt
the
weather
breaking
an
orange
sunset
waned
and
thinned
foretelling
rain
and
western
wind
and
while
i
watched
i
heard
distinct
the
metals
on
the
railway
clinked
the
clouds
were
all
in
tatters
the
sky
and
earth
seemed
mad
as
hatters
they
had
a
death
look
wild
and
odd
of
something
dark
foretold
by
god
and
seeing
it
so
i
felt
so
shaken
i
keep
the
road
taken
but
wandered
back
towards
the
inn
resolved
to
brace
myself
with
gin
and
as
i
walked
i
said
strange
death
let
loose
and
in
cabbage
walk
i
made
a
haul
of
two
big
pears
from
wall
and
munching
one
i
took
the
lane
back
into
again
dick
had
passed
the
turning
and
all
the
homend
lamps
were
burning
the
windows
shone
the
shops
were
busy
but
that
strange
heaven
made
me
dizzy
the
sky
had
all
warning
writ
in
bloody
marks
all
over
it
and
over
all
i
thought
there
was
a
ghastly
light
beside
the
gas
the
tasks
and
rages
were
giving
me
the
wages
in
always
light
the
big
shop
windows
make
it
bright
and
in
the
press
of
people
buying
i
spied
a
little
fellow
crying
because
his
gone
inside
and
left
him
there
and
so
he
cried
and
beat
him
when
she
found
him
and
whip
would
curl
right
round
him
and
say
to
crost
her
though
there
being
crowds
about
lost
her
lord
give
to
men
who
are
old
and
rougher
the
things
that
little
children
suffer
and
let
keep
bright
and
undefiled
the
young
years
of
the
little
child
i
pat
his
head
at
edge
of
street
and
my
second
pear
to
eat
right
under
lamp
i
pat
his
head
stay
till
mother
come
i
said
and
stay
i
did
and
joked
and
talked
and
shoppers
wondered
as
they
walked
that
saul
kane
the
drunken
blaggard
talking
to
little
jimmy
jaggard
the
drunken
blaggard
reeks
of
will

till
fount
her

her
at
the
linen
i
told
a
tale
to
delight
of
where
the
go
by
night
and
how
when
moonlight
come
they
went
among
the
chimneys
black
and
bent
from
roof
to
roof
from
house
to
house
with
little
baskets
full
of
mouse
all
red
and
white
both
joint
and
chop
like
meat
out
of
a
shop
then
all
along
the
wall
they
creep
and
everyone
is
fast
asleep
and
moths
go
by
and
by
the
crickets
cry
then
on
they
hurry
never
waiting
to
backyard
cellar
grating
where
cat
with
clever
paw
unhooks
a
secret
door
then
down
into
the
cellar
black
across
the
wood
slimy
track
into
an
old
quiet
hollow
where
got
seats
for
to
follow
then
each
lights
little
candles
and
o
the
stories
and
the
scandals
and
o
the
songs
and
christmas
carols
and
o
the
milk
from
little
barrels
they
light
a
fire
fit
for
roasting
and
how
good
smells
when
toasting
then
down
they
sit
to
merry
feast
while
moon
goes
west
and
sun
comes
east
sometimes
they
make
so
merry
there
old
lawyer
come
to
head
of
stair
to
with
fist
and
poker
took
firm
his
parchments
channelled
by
the
bookworm
and
all
his
deeds
and
all
his
packs
of
withered
ink
and
sealing
wax
and
there
he
stands
with
candle
raised
and
listens
like
a
man
amazed
or
like
a
ghost
a
man
stands
dumb
at
he
says
hush
sure
summat
he
hears
outside
the
brown
owl
call
he
hears
the
tap
the
wall
the
gnawing
of
the
wainscot
mouse
the
creaking
up
and
down
the
house
the
unhooked
hinges
ranging
the
sounds
that
say
the
wind
is
changing
at
last
he
turns
and
shakes
his
head
nothing
go
back
to
and
just
then
mrs
jaggard
came
to
view
and
end
her
shame
she
made
one
rush
and
a
bat
and
shook
him
like
a
dog
a
rat
turn
round
but
what
straying

you
tales
and
gipsy
playing

you
off

this
and
listening
to
whatever

little
side
of

broke
face

nor
will
do
till

for
a
human
soul
but
poached
and
stole
and
gone
with
women
and
swilled
down
gin
enough
to
swim
in
to
see
him
only
lift
one
finger
to
make
my
little
jimmy
linger
in
spite
of
all
his
prayers
and
all
her
ten
long
years
of
cares
and
all
her
broken
cry
that
finger
puts
them
by
and
jimmy
turns
and
now
i
see
that
just
as
dick
was
jim
will
be
and
all
my
life
will
have
been
vain
i
might
have
spared
myself
the
pain
and
done
the
world
a
blessed
riddance
if
a
drowned
all
like
kittens
and
he
the
sot
so
strong
and
proud
make
white
shirts
shroud
he
laughs
now
a
joke
to
him
though
the
gates
of
hell
to
jim
had
my
heart
burnt
out
like
coal
and
drops
of
blood
wrung
from
soul
day
in
day
out
in
pain
and
tears
for
five
and
twenty
wretched
years
and
he
ate
the
fat
and
sweet
and
loafed
and
spat
at
top
of
street
and
drunk
and
leched
from
day
till
morrow
and
never
known
a
sorrow
he
come
out
drunk
from
to
look
the
day
my
little
ann
was
took
he
sat
there
drinking
glad
and
gay
the
night
my
girl
was
led
astray
he
praised
my
dick
for
singing
well
the
night
dick
took
the
road
to
hell
and
when
my
corpse
goes
stiff
and
blind
leaving
four
helpless
souls
behind
he
will
be
there
still
drunk
and
strong
it
do
seem
hard
it
do
seem
wrong
but
woe
to
him
by
whom
the
offence
says
our
lord
testaments
whatever
seems
god
doth
not
slumber
though
he
lets
pass
times
without
number
come
with
trump
to
call
his
own
and
this
be
overthrown
come
with
glory
and
with
fire
to
cast
great
darkness
on
the
liar
to
burn
the
drunkard
and
the
treacher
and
do
his
judgment
on
the
lecher
to
glorify
the
faces
of
those
whose
ways
were
stony
places
who
chose
with
ruth
the
better
part
o
lord
i
see
thee
as
thou
art
o
god
the
fiery
sword
the
thunder
of
the
wrath
outpoured
the
fiery
creatures
burning
and
all
the
wheels
all
turning
coming
with
trump
and
fiery
saint
jim
take
me
home
turning
they
went
and
some
cried
old
sod
put
it
to
him
straight
by
summat
she
was
or
looked
or
said
went
home
and
made
me
hang
my
head
i
slunk
away
into
the
night
knowing
deep
down
that
she
was
right
often
heard
religious
ranters
and
put
them
down
as
windy
canters
but
this
old
mother
made
me
see
the
harm
i
done
by
being
me
being
both
strong
and
given
to
sin
i
weaker
vessels
in
so
back
to
bar
to
get
more
drink
i
dare
begin
to
think
and
there
were
drinks
and
drunken
singing
as
though
this
life
were
dice
for
flinging
dice
to
be
flung
and
nothing
furder
and
blood
just
another
murder
on
drinks
round
salue
drink
hearty
now
jane
the
for
the
party
if
any
here
drink
with
me
knock
his
bloody
eyes
out
see
come
on
cigars
round
rum
for
mine
sing
us
a
smutty
song
some
but
though
the
drinks
and
songs
went
round
that
thought
remained
it
was
not
drowned
and
when
rise
to
get
a
light
think
come
to
me
always
crowds
when
drinks
are
standing
the
house
doors
slammed
along
the
landing
the
rising
wind
was
gusty
yet
and
those
who
came
in
late
were
wet
and
all
my
nerves
were
with
sense
of
summat
to
happen
and
music
seemed
to
come
and
go
and
seven
lights
danced
in
a
row
there
used
to
be
a
custom
then
miss
bourne
the
friend
went
round
at
ten
to
all
the
pubs
in
all
the
place
to
bring
the
soul
to
grace
some
sulked
of
course
and
some
were
stirred
but
none
gave
her
a
dirty
word
a
tall
pale
woman
grey
and
bent
folk
said
of
her
that
she
was
sent
she
wore
clothes
and
women
smiled
but
a
heart
just
like
a
child
she
come
to
us
near
closing
time
when
we
were
at
some
smutty
rhyme
and
i
was
mad
and
ripe
for
fun
i
a
minded
what
i
done
so
when
she
come
so
prim
and
grey
i
pound
the
bar
and
sing
quaker
come
to
bless
and
kiss
us
come
have
a
gin
and
bitters
missus
or
may
be
quaker
girls
so
prim
would
rather
start
a
bloody
hymn
now
dick
oblige
a
hymn
you
swine
pipe
up
the
officer
of
the
line
a
song
to
make
belly
ache
or
nell
and
roger
at
the
wake
or
that
sweet
song
the
talk
in
town
the
lady
fair
and
abel
brown
o
that
knocking
at
the
door
miss
play
the
music
the
men
stood
dumb
as
cattle
are
they
grinned
but
thought
gone
too
far
there
come
a
hush
and
no
one
break
it
they
wondered
how
miss
bourne
would
take
it
she
up
to
me
with
black
eyes
wide
she
looked
as
though
her
spirit
cried
she
took
my
tumbler
from
the
bar
beside
where
all
the
matches
are
and
poured
it
out
upon
the
floor
dust
among
the
spit
and
sawdust
kane
she
said
next
you
drink
do
me
the
gentleness
to
think
that
every
drop
of
drink
accursed
makes
christ
within
you
die
of
thirst
that
every
dirty
word
you
say
is
one
more
flint
upon
his
way
another
thorn
about
his
head
another
mock
by
where
he
tread
another
nail
another
cross
all
that
you
are
is
that
the
clock
run
down
and
struck
a
chime
and
mrs
si
said
the
wet
was
pelting
on
the
pane
and
something
broke
inside
my
brain
i
heard
the
rain
drip
from
the
gutters
and
silas
putting
up
the
shutters
while
one
by
one
the
drinkers
went
i
got
a
glimpse
of
what
it
meant
how
she
and
i
had
stood
before
in
some
old
town
by
some
old
door
waiting
intent
while
someone
knocked
before
the
door
for
ever
locked
she
was
so
white
that
i
was
scared
a
turned
the
wrong
way
flared
and
silas
snapped
the
bars
in
place
miss
bourne
stood
white
and
searched
my
face
when
silas
done
with
ends
of
tunes
he
the
spittoons
his
wife
primmed
lips
and
took
the
till
miss
bourne
stood
still
and
i
stood
still
and
slow
tick
went
the
clock
she
said
waits
until
you
she
turned
at
that
and
went
out
swift
si
grinned
and
winked
his
missus
sniffed
i
heard
her
clang
the
lion
door
i
marked
a
roll
to
floor
it
took
up
scraps
of
sawdust
furry
and
crinkled
on
a
half
inch
blurry
a
drop
from
my
last
glass
of
gin
and
someone
waiting
to
come
in
a
hand
upon
the
door
latch
knocking
the
man
inside
to
open
i
know
the
very
words
i
said
they
bayed
like
bloodhounds
in
my
head
going
out
to
sea
and
a
great
moon
calling
me
but
a
great
sun
calls
the
moon
and
all
bells
will
carol
soon
for
joy
and
glory
and
delight
of
someone
coming
home
out
into
darkness
out
to
night
my
flaring
heart
gave
plenty
light
so
wild
it
was
there
was
no
knowing
whether
the
clouds
or
stars
were
blowing
blown
chimney
pots
and
folk
blown
blind
and
puddles
glimmering
like
my
mind
and
chinking
glass
from
windows
banging
and
inn
signs
swung
like
people
hanging
and
in
my
heart
the
drink
unpriced
the
burning
cataracts
of
christ
i
did
not
think
i
did
not
strive
the
deep
peace
burnt
my
me
alive
the
bolted
door
had
broken
in
i
knew
that
i
had
done
with
sin
i
knew
that
christ
had
given
me
birth
to
brother
all
the
souls
on
earth
and
every
bird
and
every
beast
should
share
the
crumbs
broke
at
the
feast
o
glory
of
the
lighted
mind
how
dead
been
how
dumb
how
blind
the
station
brook
to
my
new
eyes
was
babbling
out
of
paradise
the
waters
rushing
from
the
rain
were
singing
christ
has
risen
again
i
thought
all
earthly
creatures
knelt
from
rapture
of
the
joy
i
felt
the
narrow
brick
ledge
the
wild
hop
withering
in
the
hedge
the
lights
in
upper
storey
were
parts
of
an
eternal
glory
were
eternal
garden
flowers
i
stood
in
bliss
at
this
for
hours
o
glory
of
the
lighted
soul
the
dawn
came
up
on
bradlow
knoll
the
dawn
with
glittering
on
the
grasses
the
dawn
which
pass
and
never
passes
dawn
i
said
smoking
and
all
the
blessed
fields
are
soaking
dawn
and
an
engine
shunting
and
hounds
for
going
hunting
dawn
and
i
must
wander
north
along
the
road
christ
led
me
so
up
the
road
i
wander
slow
past
where
the
snowdrops
used
to
grow
with
celandines
in
early
springs
when
rainbows
were
triumphant
things
and
dew
so
bright
and
flowers
so
glad
eternal
joy
to
lass
and
lad
and
past
the
lovely
brook
i
paced
the
brook
whose
source
i
never
traced
the
brook
the
one
of
two
which
rise
in
my
green
dream
in
paradise
in
wells
where
heavenly
buckets
clink
to
give
wandering
thirsty
drink
by
those
clean
cots
of
carven
stone
where
the
clear
water
sings
alone
then
down
past
that
pond
and
past
the
chestnut
trees
beyond
and
past
the
bridge
the
fishers
knew
where
yellow
flag
flowers
once
grew
where
go
gathering
cops
of
clover
in
sunny
june
times
long
since
over
o
half
white
half
red
o
beauty
from
beyond
the
dead
o
blossom
key
to
earth
and
heaven
o
souls
that
christ
has
new
forgiven
then
down
the
hill
to
pitch
by
where
the
brook
clucks
in
the
ditch
a
camp
was
in
the
copse
three
felted
tents
with
beehive
tops
and
round
black
marks
where
fires
had
been
and
one
old
waggon
painted
green
and
three
ribbed
horses
wrenching
grass
and
three
wild
boys
to
watch
me
pass
and
one
old
woman
by
the
fire
hulking
a
rabbit
warm
from
wire
i
loved
to
see
the
horses
bait
i
felt
i
walked
at
gate
that
gate
was
opened
wide
yet
still
the
gipsies
camped
outside
the
waste
souls
will
prefer
the
wild
long
after
life
is
meek
and
mild
perhaps
when
man
has
entered
in
his
perfect
city
free
from
sin
the
campers
will
come
past
the
walls
with
old
lame
horses
full
of
galls
and
waggons
hung
about
with
withies
and
burning
coke
in
stithies
and
see
the
golden
town
and
choose
and
think
the
wild
too
good
to
lose
and
camp
outside
as
these
camped
then
with
wonder
at
the
entering
men
so
past
and
past
the
white
that
dewberry
trailers
hid
from
sight
and
down
the
field
so
full
of
springs
where
mewing
peewits
clap
their
wings
and
past
the
trap
made
for
the
mill
into
the
field
below
the
hill
there
was
a
mist
along
the
stream
a
wet
mist
dim
like
in
a
dream
i
heard
the
heavy
breath
of
cows
and
waterdrops
from
boughs
and
eels
or
snakes
in
dripping
grass
whipping
aside
to
let
me
pass
the
gate
was
backed
against
the
ryme
to
pass
the
cows
at
milking
time
and
by
the
gate
as
i
went
out
a
moldwarp
rooted
earth
wi
snout
a
few
steps
up
the
lane
brought
me
above
the
mist
again
the
two
great
fields
arose
like
death
above
the
mists
of
human
breath
all
earthly
things
that
blessed
morning
were
everlasting
joy
and
warning
the
gate
was
way
made
plain
the
mole
was
satan
foiled
again
black
blinded
satan
snouting
way
along
the
red
of
clay
the
mist
was
error
and
damnation
the
lane
the
road
unto
salvation
out
of
the
mist
into
the
light
o
blessed
gift
of
inner
sight
the
past
was
faded
like
a
dream
there
come
the
jingling
of
a
team
a
voice
a
clink
of
chain
slow
hoofs
and
harness
under
strain
up
the
slow
slope
a
team
came
bowing
old
callow
at
his
autumn
ploughing
old
callow
stooped
above
the
hales
ploughing
the
stubble
into
wales
his
grave
eyes
looking
straight
ahead
shearing
a
long
straight
furrow
red
his
high
to
give
it
earth
to
bring
new
food
for
men
to
birth
o
wet
red
swathe
of
earth
laid
bare
o
truth
o
strength
o
gleaming
share
o
patient
eyes
that
watch
the
goal
o
ploughman
of
the
soul
o
jesus
drive
the
coulter
deep
to
plough
my
living
man
from
sleep
slow
up
the
hill
the
plough
team
plod
old
callow
at
the
task
of
god
helped
by
wit
helped
by
the
brute
turning
a
stubborn
clay
to
fruit
his
eyes
for
ever
on
some
sign
to
help
him
plough
a
perfect
line
at
top
of
rise
the
plough
team
stopped
the
bent
his
head
and
cropped
then
the
chains
chack
the
brasses
jingle
the
lean
reins
gather
through
the
cringle
the
figures
move
against
the
sky
the
clay
wave
breaks
as
they
go
by
i
kneeled
there
in
the
muddy
fallow
i
knew
that
christ
was
there
with
callow
that
christ
was
standing
there
with
me
that
christ
had
taught
me
what
to
be
that
i
should
plough
and
as
i
ploughed
my
saviour
christ
would
sing
aloud
and
as
i
drove
the
clods
apart
christ
would
be
ploughing
in
my
heart
through
and
bitter
roots
through
all
my
bad
rotten
fruits
o
christ
who
holds
the
open
gate
o
christ
who
drives
the
furrow
straight
o
christ
the
plough
o
christ
the
laughter
of
holy
white
birds
flying
after
lo
all
my
field
red
and
torn
and
thou
wilt
bring
the
young
green
corn
the
young
green
corn
divinely
springing
the
young
green
corn
for
ever
singing
and
when
the
field
is
fresh
and
fair
thy
blessed
feet
shall
glitter
there
and
we
will
walk
the
weeded
field
and
tell
the
golden
yield
the
corn
that
makes
the
holy
bread
by
which
the
soul
of
man
is
fed
the
holy
bread
the
food
unpriced
thy
everlasting
mercy
christ
the
share
will
jar
on
many
a
stone
thou
wilt
not
let
me
stand
alone
and
i
shall
feel
thou
wilt
not
fail
thy
hand
on
mine
upon
the
hale
near
bullen
bank
on
gloucester
road
thy
everlasting
mercy
showed
the
ploughman
patient
on
the
hill
for
ever
there
for
ever
still
ploughing
the
hill
with
steady
yoke
of
and
broke
marked
the
may
hill
ploughman
stay
there
on
his
hill
day
after
day
driving
his
team
against
the
sky
while
men
and
women
live
and
die
and
now
and
then
he
seems
to
stoop
to
clear
the
coulter
with
the
scoop
or
touch
an
ox
to
haw
or
gee
while
severn
stream
goes
out
to
sea
the
sea
with
all
her
ships
and
sails
and
that
great
smoky
port
in
wales
and
gloucester
tower
bright
the
sun
all
know
that
patient
wandering
one
and
sometimes
when
they
burn
the
leaves
the
smoking
trails
and
heaves
and
girt
red
flames
twink
and
twire
as
though
he
ploughed
the
hill
afire
and
in
hearts
in
many
lands
a
spiritual
ploughman
stands
for
ever
waiting
waiting
now
the
in
man
zook
the
by
this
the
sun
was
all
one
glitter
the
little
birds
were
all
in
twitter
out
of
a
tuft
a
little
lark
went
higher
up
than
i
could
mark
his
little
throat
was
all
one
thirst
to
sing
until
his
heart
should
burst
to
sing
aloft
in
golden
light
his
song
from
blue
air
out
of
sight
the
mist
drove
by
and
now
the
cows
came
plodding
up
to
milking
house
followed
by
frank
the
cowman
who
whistled
was
a
there
come
such
cawing
from
the
rooks
such
running
chuck
from
little
brooks
one
thought
it
march
just
budding
green
with
hedgerows
full
of
celandine
an
otter
out
of
stream
and
played
two
hares
come
loping
up
and
stayed
and
but
bold
sheep
bleated
up
by
fold
i
heard
a
partridge
covey
call
the
morning
sun
was
bright
on
all
down
the
long
slope
the
plough
team
drove
the
tossing
rooks
arose
and
hove
a
stone
struck
on
the
share
a
word
came
to
the
team
the
red
earth
stirred
i
crossed
the
hedge
by
gap
i
hitched
my
belt
a
strap
i
jumped
the
ditch
and
crossed
the
fallow
i
took
the

third
impression
mr
masefield
is
no
common
realist
but
universalizes
his
tragedy
in
the
grand
manner
we
are
convinced
that
he
is
writing
truly
of
human
nature
which
is
the
vital
thing
the
last
few
stanzas
show
us
pastoral
poetry
in
the
very
perfection
of
in
widow
in
the
bye
all
mr
passionate
love
of
loveliness
is
utterly
fused
with
the
violent
and
unlovely
story
which
glows
with
an
inner
harmony
the
poem
it
is
true
ends
on
a
note
of
idyllism
which
recalls
theocritus
but
this
is
no
touch
of
eternal
decoration

third
impression
in

tragedy
while
we
admire
its
closely
knit
structure
dramatic
effectiveness
and
atmosphere
of
reality
the
warmth
and
colour
of
the
diction
are
the
most
notable
things
he
knows
the
art
of
phrasing
he
has
the
instinct
for
and
by
he
has
written
a
great
tragedy
the
dialogue
is
written
in
strong
simple
and
nervous
prose
flashing
with
poetic
insight
significance
and
suggestion
the
characters
are
intensely
alive
the
situations
are
handled
by
a
master
hand
and
the
whole
play
is
pregnant
with
that
high
and
solemn
pathos
which
is
the
gift
of
the
