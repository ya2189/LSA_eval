white

clear
where
human

have
worn
it
zigzagging
higher
and
higher
till
it
loses
itself
in
the
southern
skyline
a
patch
of
young
corn
to
my
right
hand
swaying
and
swaying
continuously
tho
hardly
an
air
stirs
a
falcon
wheeling
overhead
the

rising
the
damp

of
the
night
in

nostrils
o

to
you

mine

kneel
down
and

the

under
my

the
sense
of
the
mystery
and
infinity
of

overwhelms
me
annihilates
me
almost

dead

only
clay

christ
of

fair
body
upon
a
middle
winter
morn
between
the
tides
of
night
and
day
in
ara
holy
isle
was
born
mary
went
upon
her
knee
travailing
in
ecstasy
and
brigid
mistress
of
the
birth
full
reverently
and
tenderly
laid
the
child
upon
the
earth
then
the
rose
did
blow
and
rivers
leaped
from
out
the
snow
earth
grew
lyrical
the
grass
as
the
light
winds
chanced
to
pass
than
magian
music
more
profound
murmured
in
a
maze
of
sound
white
incense
rose
upon
the
hills
as
from
a
thousand
thuribles
and
in
the
east
a
star
proclaimed
the
news
to
near
and
far
the
shepherd
danced
the
gilly
ran
the
boatman
left
his
curachan
the
king
came
riding
on
the
wind
to
offer
gifts
of
coin
and
kind
the
druid
dropped
his
ogham
wand
and
said
another
day
at
hand
a
newer
dawn
is
in
the
sky
i
put
my
withered
sapling
by
the
druid
christ
has
taken
breath
to
sing
the
runes
of
life
and
death
i
gather
three
ears
of
corn
i
gather
three
ears
of
corn
and
the
black
earl
from
over
the
sea
sails
across
in
his
silver
ships
and
takes
two
out
of
the
three
i
might
build
a
house
on
the
hill
and
a
barn
of
the
speckly
stone
and
tell
my
little
stocking
of
gold
if
the
earl
would
let
me
alone
but
he
has
no
thought
for
me
only
the
thought
of
his
share
and
the
softness
of
the
linsey
shifts
his
lazy
daughters
wear
there
is
a
god
in
heaven
and
angels
score
on
score
who
will
not
see
my
hearthstone
cold
because
i
crazed
and
poor
my
childer
have
my
blood
and
when
they
get
their
beards
they
will
not
be
content
to
run
as
gillies
to
their
herds
the
day
will
come
maybe
when
we
can
have
our
own
and
the
black
earl
will
come
to
us
begging
the
bacach
bone
the
tinkers
one
knows
another
and
why
should
i
know
you
you
rogue
they
say
a
stroller
will
never
pair
except
with
one
of
his
kind
and
care
so
talked
two
tinkers
prone
in
the
shough
and
then
as
the
fun
got
a
trifle
rough
they
flitted
he
with
his
bass
she
with
her
load
of
tin
and
brass
as
mad
a
match
as
you
would
see
in
a
twelvemonth
ride
thro
christendie
he
roared
they
both
were
drunk
as
hell
she
danced
and
danced
it
mighty
well
i
could
have
eyed
them
longer
but
they
staggered
for
the
quarry
cut
that
seemed
to
trouble
them
more
than
all
the
leagues
they
tramped
before
some
drink
at
the
fair
the
morrow
and
some
sup
with
the
spoon
of
sorrow
but
whether
get
as
far
as
droichid
the
night
well
who
knows
that
but

came

over

grey

the

it

the

away
and
the

in
the

is
dying
and
a

cloud
on
the

the

wake
i
watched
at
a
beggar
wake
in
the
hills
of
and
the
old
men
were
telling
stories
of
troy
and
the
trojan
war
and
a
flickering
fire
of
burned
on
the
open
hearth
and
the
roared
in
the
chimney
and
darkness
was
over
the
earth
and

macgiolla
the
piper
of
gort
was
there
and
he
sat
and
he
dreamed
apart
in
the
arms
of
a
sugan
chair
and
sudden
he
woke
from
his
dream
like
a
child
and
his
lips
were
pale
and
trembling
and
his
eyes
were
wild
and
he
stood
straight
up
and
he
cried
with
a
wave
of
his
withered
hand
the
days
of
the
grasping
stranger
shall
be
few
in
the
land
the
scrip
of
his
doom
is
written
the
thread
of
his
shroud
is
spun
the
net
of
his
strength
is
broken
the
tide
of
his
life
is
then
he
sank
to
his
seat
like
a
stone
and
the
watchers
stared
aghast
and
they
crossed
themselves
for
fear
as
the
coffin
cart
went
past
at
the
battle
of
the
fate
the
poets
foretold
shall
fall
on
the
neck
of
the
stranger
and
redden
the
plashy
mould
the
bagmen
carry
the
story
the
circuit
of
ireland
round
and
they
sing
it
at
fair
and
hurling
from
edair
to
acaill
sound
and
the
folk
repeat
it
over
about
the
winter
fires
till
the
heart
of
each
one
listening
is
burning
with
fierce
desires
in
the
glen
of

shall

and

shall
march
at

massed
in

shall

on

blood
charging

scattered
in

shall
rot
from

after

battle
is
done
for
lack
of
a
hand
to
undo
them
and
hide
them
out
of
the
sun
it
shall
not
be
the
battle
between
the
folk
and
the
sidhe
at
the
rape
of
a
bride
from
her
bed
or
a
babe
from
its
mother
knee

shall
not

white
hosts
flying
and
the
shrieking
devils
of
hell
for

at
the
point

dying

not
be
the
battle
between
the
sun
and
the
leaves
between
the
winter
and
summer
between
the
storm
and
the
sheaves
but
a
battle
to
doom
and
death
between

and
the
gall
between
the
sword
of
light
and
the
shield
of
darkness
and

and
the
gael
shall
have
the
mastery
after
a
month
of
days
and
the
lakes
of
the
west
shall
cry
and
the
hills
of

north
shall
blaze
and

shall
be
as

stool
for
the
feet
of
ciaran
chief
of
the
gael
sitting
in

seat
at
this
macgiolla
fainted
tearing
his
yellow
hair
and
the
young
men
cursed
the
stranger
and
the
old
men
mouthed
a
prayer
for
they
knew
the
day
would
come
as
sure
as
the
piper
said
when
many
loves
would
be
parted
and
many
graves
would
be
red
and
the
wake
broke
up
in
tumult
and
the
women
were
left
alone
keening
over
the
beggar
that
died
at
gobnat

out

on

the

inner

that
burns
with
magic
caught
from

wander
thro
the

necks
stretched

crouching

i
have
a

to
go
a

to

and
a

to
sign
in

but
i
slacken
my
pace
to
watch
them
the
natural
lend
us
the
loan
of
a
halfpenny
sir
and
he
passed
with
his
splendid
nose
in
the
air
a
gaunt
grey
carcase
of
skin
and
bones
as
cold
as
the
river
as
hard
as
the
stones
to
him
the
highway
was
table
and

shift
for
the
newborn
and
sheet
for
the
dead
the
wind
that
blew
from
beola
crest
seemed
fire
to
fetter
his
wild
unrest
the
rain
that
beat
on
his
neck
and
face
a
goad
to
quicken
him
in
his
pace
but
sorrow
a
step
he
changed
and
his
prayer
was
still
lend
us
the
loan
of
a
halfpenny
sir
on
the
on
the
a
nipping
wind
blowing
winter
dusk
closing
in
from
the
south
ards
the
moon
rising
white
and
fantastic
over
the
loch
and
the
town
below
i
take
off
my
hat
salute
her
and
descend
into
the
darkness
the
women
at
their
doors
the
babes
were
asleep
in
their
cradles
and
the
day
drudge
was
done
and
the
women
brought
their
suppers
out
to
eat
them
in
the
sun
i
will
set
my
needles
aine
and
eoghan
will
have
stockings
to
wear
i
spun
the
wool
of
the
horny
ewe
he
bought
at
the
hiring
but
what
is
that
sound
i
hear
nabla
it
is
like
the
cheering
of
men
god
keep
our
kind
from
the
devil
snare
and
the
women
answered
amen
then
the
moon
rose
over
the
valley
and
the
cheering
died
away
and
the
women
went
within
their
doors
at
the
mouth
of
the
summer
day
and
no
men
came
in
at
midnight
and
no
men
came
in
at
the
dawn
and
the
women
keened
by
their
ashy
fires
till
their
faces
were
haggard
and
wan
for
they
knew
they
had
gone
to
the
trysting
with
pike
and
musketoon
to
fight
for
their
hearths
and
altars
at
the
rising
of
the
moon
my
little
dark
love
my
little
dark
love
is
a
wineberry
as
swarth
and
as
sweet
i
hold
but
as
the
dew
on
the
wineberry
her
heart
is
i
would
her
love
were
as
warm
as
the
light
that
lives
in
her
eye
of
grey
and
then
my
heart
would
know
the
peace
it
dreams
in
the
hills
away
i
would
her
love
were
as
red
as
the
rose
that
blows
on
her
cheek
of
brown
and
then
my
sunless
soul
would
laugh
at
the
woe
that
weighs
it
down
she
dwells
in
the
valley
my
little
dark
love
where
the
river
sings
to
the
sea
and
an
sits
by
her
door
and
nigh
to
it
hazels
three
and
oft
when
the
purple
twilight
comes
and
the
blind
bats
flit
in
the
air
i
wander
down
from
the
quiet
hills
to
seek
my
sweetheart
there
but
she
comes
never
she
loves
not
me
nor
ever
will
love
i
hold
for
tho
my
heart
is
a
peat
of
fire
her
heart
is
i
heard
a
piper
piping
i
heard
a
piper
piping
the
blue
hills
among
and
never
did
i
hear
so
plaintive
a
song
it
seemed
but
a
part
of
the
hills
melancholy
no
piper
living
there
could
ever
be
jolly
and
still
the
piper
piped
the
blue
hills
among
and
all
the
birds
were
quiet
to
listen
to
his
song
the
clouds
go
by
and
by
the
clouds
go
by
and
by
the
heron
sings
in
the
blue
and
i
lie
dreaming

ever
of

people
as
the

and
he
moved
among
their
thatches
and
for
them
he
was
crucified
and
the
people
loved
him
also
more
than
their
houses
or
lands
for
they
had
known
his
pity
and
felt
the
touch
of
his
hands
and
they
dreamed
with
him
in
the
mountains
and
they
walked
with
him
on
the
sea
and
they
prayed
with
him
in
the
garden
and
bled
with
him
on
the
tree
not
ever
by
longing
and
dreaming
may
they
come
to
him
now

by
