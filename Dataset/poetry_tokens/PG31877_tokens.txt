foreword
the
poems
of
this
volume
gathered
here
after
many
requests
are
with
a
few
exceptions
from
my
previous
lyrical
publications
they
are
also
in
a
real
sense
an
intimate
record
for
the
sea
has
often
enough
seemed
to
me
almost
as
a
vast
external
subconsciousness
in
which
the
forces
of
my
being
as
well
as
the
world
were
at
play

poems
by
cale
young
rice
my
heart
is
open
again
and
sea
flows
in
it
shall
fill
with
a
summer
of
mists
and
winds
and
clouds
and
waves
breaking
of
over
the
green
tide
of
the
surf
drenching
din
of
sudden
that
come
and
vanish
of
arching
sapphire
skies
deep
and
unaching
i
shall
lie
on
the
rocks
just
over
the
weeds
that
drape
the
clear
where
birth
and
death
in
sunny
ooze
are
teeming
where
the
crab
in
quest
of
booty
sidles
about
a
sullen
shape
where
the
snail
creeps
and
the
mussel
sleeps
with
wary
valves
agape
where
life
is
too
grotesque
to
be
but
seeming
and
the
swallow
shall
weave
my
dreams
with
threads
of
flight
a
shuttle
with
silver
breast
across
the
warp
of
the
waves
gliding
and
an
isle
far
out
shall
be
a
beam
in
the
loom
of
my
delight
and
the
pattern
of
every
dream
shall
be
a
rapture
bathed
in
light
its
evanescence
a
beauty
most
abiding
and
the
sunsets
shall
give
sadness
all
its
due
they
shall
stain
the
sands
and
trouble
the
tides
with
all
the
ache
of
sorrow
they
shall
bleed
and
die
with
a
beauty
of
meaning
old
yet
ever
new
they
shall
burn
with
all
the
hunger
for
things
that
hearts
have
failed
to
do
they
shall
whisper
of
a
gold
that
none
can
borrow
and
the
stars
shall
come
and
build
a
bridge
of
fire
for
the
moon
to
cross
the
boundless
sea
with
never
a
fear
of
sinking
they
shall
teach
me
of
the
magic
things
of
life
never
to
tire
and
how
to
renew
when
it
is
low
the
lamp
of
my
desire
and
how
to
hope
in
the
darkest
deeps
of
thinking
the
shore
song
to
the
sea
out
on
the
rocks
primeval
the
grey
maine
rocks
that
slant
and
break
to
the
sea
with
the
bay
and
juniper
round
them
and
the
leagues
on
leagues
before
them
and
the
terns
and
gulls
wheeling
and
crying
wheeling
and
crying
over
i
sat
and
listened
and
first
i
could
only
hear
the
wind
in
my
ears
and
the
foam
trying
to
fill
the
high
and
then
over
the
wind
over
the
whitely
blossoming
foam
low
low
like
a
lover
song
beginning
i
heard
the
nuptial
pleading
of
the
old
shore
a
pleading
ever
occultly
growing
louder
sea
glad
bride
of
me
born
of
the
bright
ether
and
given
to
wed
me
given
to
glance
ever
for
me
and
gleam
and
dance
in
the
sun
come
to
my
arms
come
to
my
reaching
arms
that
seem
so
still
and
unavailing
to
take
you
and
hold
you
yet
never
forget
never
by
day
or
night
the
hymeneal
delights
of
your
for
the
moon
my
rival
shall
not
have
you
no
for
tho
twice
daily
afar
he
beckons
and
you
go
you
my
bride
a
little
way
back
to
meet
him
as
if
he
once
had
been
your
lover
he
too
and
again
enspelled
you
soon
soon
i
know
it
is
only
feigning
for
turning
playfully
turning
tidally
turning
you
rush
foamingly
swiftly
back
to
my
arms
so
would
i
have
you
rush
so
rush
now
come
from
the
sands
where
you
have
stayed
too
long
come
from
the
reefs
where
you
have
wandered
silent
for
ebbings
are
good
the
restful
ebbings
of
love
but
oh
the
bridal
flowings
of
it
are
better
and
now
i
would
have
you
loose
again
my
tresses
my
locks
rough
and
weedy
rough
and
brown
and
brinily
tangled
but
oh
again
as
a
bridegroom
when
your
tide
whispering
in
lifts
them
up
pulsingly
up
with
kisses
with
your
veil
thrown
back
breaking
to
spray
and
oh
with
plangent
passion
come
with
your
naked
sweetness
salt
and
wholesome
to
my
bosom
let
not
a
cave
or
crevice
of
me
miss
you
or
cranny
for
oh
the
nuptial
joy
you
float
into
me
the
cooling
ambient
clasp
of
you
i
have
waited
and
i
need
to
know
again
its
marriage
meaning
i
think
it
is
not
alone
to
bring
forth
life
that
i
mate
you
more
than
life
is
the
beauty
of
life
with
love
plentiful
are
the
children
that
you
bear
to
me
the
blossoms
the
fruits
and
all
the
creatures
at
your
breast
dewily
fed
but
mating
is
troubled
with
a
far
higher
meaning
a
hint
of
a
consummation
for
all
things
come
utterly
then
utterly
to
me
come
and
let
us
surge
together
clasped
close
in
infinite
union
until
we
reach
a
transcendence
of
all
birth
and
all
dying
an
ecstasy
holding
the
universe
blended
such
ecstasy
as
is
its
ultimate
aim
so
sang
the
shore
the
long
shore
broken
by
many
an
isle
many
an
inlet
and
the
sea
gave
answer
bridally
tidally
turning
and
leapt
radiant
into
his
rocky
arms
to
a
firefly
by
the
sea
little
alone
with
me
in
the
night
you
can
not
light
the
sea
nor
i
illumine
life
they
are
too
vast
for
us
they
are
too
deep
for
us
we
glow
with
all
our
strength
but
back
the
shadows
sweep
and
after
a
while
will
come
unshadowed
sleep
here
on
the
rocks
that
take
the
turning
tide
here
by
the
wide
lone
waves
and
lonelier
wastes
of
sky
we
keep
our
as
patient
poets
should
questioning
earth
commingled
ill
and
good
to
us
yet
little
of
them
or
naught
have
truly
understood
bright
are
the
stars
and
constellated
thick
to
you
so
quick
to
flit
along
your
flickering
course
they
seem
perhaps
as
glowing
mates
in
other
fields
and
all
the
knowledge
i
have
gathered
yields
to
me
scarce
more
of
the
great
mystery
their
wonder
wields
for
the
moon
we
are
waiting
and
behold
her
ardent
gold
drifts
up
her
sail
has
caught
the
breeze
that
blows
all
being
thro
the
universe
always
so
now
little
you
no
more
need
nurse
your
gleam
for
lo
she
mounts
and
sullen
clouds
disperse
and
i
with
aching
thought
may
cease
to
burn
and
humbly
turn
to
rest
knowing
no
glow
of
mine
can
ever
be
so
beauteous
as
have
been
to
me
your
soft
beams
here
beside
the
sea
elusive
din
for
grief
too
oft
has
kindled
me
and
pain
and
the
world
sin
invocation
a
high
sweep
unrest
out
of
my
blood
winds
of
the
sea
sweep
the
fog
out
of
my
brain
for
i
am
one
who
has
told
life
he
will
be
free
who
will
not
doubt
of
work
that
done
who
will
not
fear
the
work
to
do
who
will
hold
peaks
promethean
better
than
all
jove
who
when
the
vulture
tears
his
breast
will
smile
into
the
terror
eyes
who
for
the
world
has
this
bequest
hope
that
eternally
is
wise
i
know
your
heart
o
sea
i
know
your
heart
o
sea
you
are
tossed
with
cold
desire
to
flood
earth
utterly
you
run
at
the
cliffs
you
fling
wild
billows
at
beaches
you
reach
at
islands
with
fingers
of
foam
to
crumble
them
yes
even
at
mountain
tops
you
shout
your
purpose
of
making
the
earth
a
shoreless
circle
of
waters
i
know
your
surging
heart
tides
mighty
and
rise
within
it
tides
spurred
by
the
wind
to
champ
and
charge
and
thunder
tho
the
sun
and
moon
rein
them
at
the
troubling
land
the
of
mortals
of
men
who
are
ever
transmuting
life
to
spirit
and
ever
taking
your
salt
to
savor
their
tears
i
know
your
tides
i
know
them
down
they
rage
with
the
questing
of
men
and
crying
with
their
continents
cradles
of
grief
and
despair
better
entombing
waters
for
them
better
our
deeps
unfathomed
where
birth
is
soulless
life
goalless
death
for
all
and
where
dark
ooze
enshrouds
past
resurrection
ah
yes
i
know
your
heart
i
have
heard
it
raving
at
set
to
reveal
you
i
have
watched
it
foam
at
ships
that
sought
to
defy
you
i
have
seen
it
straining
at
cables
that
cross
you
bearing
whispers
hid
to
you
or
heaving
at
waves
of
the
air
that
tell
your
hurricanes
i
know
i
know
your
heart
men
you
will
sink
and
shores
will
sink
but
a
shore
shall
be
man
forever
from
whence
his
lighthouse
soul
shall
signal
the
infinite
whose
fleets
go
by
star
after
star
bearing
their
unknown
burden
to
a
port
which
only
eternity
shall
determine
a
oh
go
in
from
the
sea
and
furl
your
wings
the
bay
is
gray
with
the
twilit
spray
and
the
loud
surf
springs
the
chill
is
rung
by
the
hands
of
all
the
drowned
who
know
the
woe
of
the
wind
and
tow
of
the
tides
around
go
in
go
in
oh
haste
from
the
sea
and
let
them
rest
the
throng
who
long
for
the
air
still
long
but
are
still
unblest
aye
even
as
i
whose
hands
at
the
bell
now
labour
most
the
tomb
has
gloom
but
oh
the
doom
of
the
drear
he
evermore
must
wander
the
ooze
beneath
the
wave
forlorn
to
warn
of
the
tempest
born
and
to
save
to
save
then
go
go
in
and
leave
us
the
sea
for
only
so
can
peace
release
us
and
give
us
ease
of
our
salty
woe
finitude
i
one
ruby
amid
a
diamond
spray
of
stars
the
coast
light
flashes
the
tide
plashes
across
a
mile
of
land
the
moon
comes
soon
she
has
lost
half
of
her
lustre
and
looks
old
a
cricket
finitude
incarnate
cry
and
the
infinite
waters
with
their
hushless
sigh
are
the
two
sounds
the
night
has
each
in
eternal
wistfulness
abounds
ii
i
have
wakened
out
of
my
sleep
because
i
too
am
wistful
tristeful
because
i
know
that
half
of
is
gone
and
that
all
frailty
cries
in
the
cricket
tone
i
have
wakened
out
of
my
sleep
to
watch
and
listen
for
what
to
see
for
a
moment
universes
glisten
to
wonder
and
want
and
go
to
sleep
again
and
die
and
be
forgot
the
colonel
story
no
no
my
friend
there
is
an
agony
not
to
be
exorcised
out
of
the
world
by
any
voice
of
but
i
will
tell
you
the
was
sailing
without
lights
bearing
three
hundred
souls
and
without
bells
for
she
had
reached
the
zone
where
the
hun
sharks
with
their
torpedo
tongues
could
spit
death
at
us
out
of
the
inky
where
they
hid
on
the
main
deck
we
stood
in
a
my
wife
and
by
us
a
pale
girl
whose
eyes
had
all
disaster
in
them
and
my
thought
was
i
hope
to
god
the
moon
is
shut
so
deep
in
there
in
the
east
that
hurricanes
ca
blow
her
out
of
it
for
in
the
zone
the
moon
had
come
to
mean
only
betrayal
and
now
if
ever
was
her
wanton
chance
the
slipping
water
soaked
with
soulless
dark
fell
under
and
around
us
shudderingly
yet
somehow
brought
an
anxious
hopefulness
we
making
twenty
knots
i
said
and
felt
our
bow
cut
thro
the
tangle
of
the
waves
as
if
the
no
man
ahead
of
us
would
soon
be
crossed
and
i
out
to
rejoin
my
regiment
could
set
my
wife
safe
somewhere
and
help
again
to
stab
that
curst
amphibian
autocracy
whose
spawn
in
the
sea
gave
it
a
terror
greater
than
infinitude
for
god
knows
with
the
woman
that
one
loves
aboard
a
ship
and
only
a
cloud
perhaps
between
the
hun
shark
eyes
and
sure
escape
from
the
black
icy
fathoms
that
would
choke
her
there
little
left
within
a
man
but
nerves
so
when
i
drew
her
closer
into
the
shelter
out
of
the
sheering
wind
the
life
belt
she
wore
seemed
like
a
coffin
in
that
sepulchre
of
night
and
sea
and
when
the
other
there
with
the
disaster
eyes
and
pallid
face
turned
half
toward
us
i
was
shaken
as
if
the
moon
had
suddenly
walked
out
of
her
shroud
with
phosphorescent
purpose
to
reveal
us
but
on
we
plunged
and
tumbled
till
at
last
the
blank
monotonous
sink
and
swell
lulled
me
to
faith
and
i
was
only
thinking
softly
of
her
my
wife
first
kiss
on
a
summer
night
under
the
moonlit
laurels
of
our
home
when
came
a
cry
from
the
wan
girl
gazing
frozenly
on
the
sea
where
the
moon
now
indeed
was
pointing
at
us
pallidly
a
and
my
throat
was
gripped
by
it
that
clutching
cry
as
if
the
glacial
depths
down
under
us
already
had
risen
up
so
starting
toward
the
slipping
rail
i
called
what
is
it
where
for
tense
as
a
clairvoyant
with
eyes
that
seemed
to
feel
under
the
tide
the
stealthy
peril
stalking
us
she
stood
there
after
a
moment
gazing
i
too
saw
what
she
foresensed
destruction
seething
toward
us
the
boats
i
cried
the
rafts
and
stumbled
back
over
the
streaming
deck
to
her
i
loved
then
the
shock
came
as
if
the
sea
wild
heart
had
broken
under
us
and
ripped
the
entrails
the
human
hundreds
out
of
our
vessel
hold
to
strew
the
foam
with
mania
and
despair
with
shrieks
strangled
by
wind
and
wave
and
terror
and
thro
that
floating
mangled
blind
confusion
where
hands
reached
at
the
infinite
then
sank
where
faces
clung
to
wreckage
as
to
eternity
i
sought
for
her
who
shared
my
life
voyage
who
had
been
my
heart
pilot
and
who
now
wrecked
with
me
swirled
too
in
the
torn
waters
and
soon
i
saw
her
still
by
that
wan
girl
tossed
on
a
watery
omnipotence
blind
with
brine
i
swam
for
her
as
the
moon
her
treachery
done
again
got
to
a
cloud
flung
back
by
every
wave
i
fought
beating
against
them
as
against
god
and
soon
somehow
had
reached
to
a
limp
body
on
the
surge
limp
and
strange
but
living
and
not
drowned
then
seeing
a
raft
near
i
struggled
onward
gulping
the
sea
and
being
gulped
by
it
but
finding
arms
at
last
that
drew
my
burden
and
me
from
horror
to
safety
i
could
have
died
i
think
of
the
relief
but
the
moon
came
again
nakedly
out
as
if
to
see
what
she
had
done
then
i
bending
over
the
form
that
i
had
fought
for
and
chafing
it
saw
not
her
i
loved
infinite
cruelty
not
her
i
loved
but
that
pale
girl
with
the
eyes
of
all
disaster
oh
yes
i
raved
and
said
god
was
a
hun
a
kaiser
of
a
universe
that
loathed
him
and
back
too
would
have
leapt
into
the
waves
but
the
same
hands
that
saved
were
ready
to
hold
me
cosmism
the
sea
asleep
like
a
dreamer
sighs
the
salt
lie
still
in
the
sun
except
for
the
sidling
crab
that
creeps
thro
the
moveless
mosses
green
and
dun
the
small
gray
snail
clings
everywhere
for
the
tide
is
out
and
the
dries
its
tangled
tresses
in
the
warm
air
that
seems
to
ooze
from
the
far
blue
skies
where
not
a
white
gull
on
white
wing
flies
the
mollusc
gleams
like
a
gem
amid
the
scurf
and
the
clustered
green
whose
trellis
is
but
the
rock
bare
side
whose
husbandman
but
the
tide
that
drapes
the
little
sandpiper
tilts
and
picks
his
food
on
the
wet
hid
till
sudden
a
wave
comes
in
and
flicks
him
off
then
flashes
away
to
bid
another
frighten
him
as
it
did
o
sweet
is
the
world
of
living
things
and
sweet
are
the
mingled
sea
and
shore
it
seems
as
if
i
never
again
shall
find
life
ill
as
oft
before
as
if
my
days
should
come
as
the
clouds
come
yonder
and
vanish
without
wings
as
if
all
sorrow
that
ever
shrouds
my
soul
and
darkly
about
it
clings
had
lost
forever
its
ravenings
as
if
i
knew
with
a
deeper
sense
that
good
alone
is
ultimate
that
never
an
evil
wrought
of
god
or
man
came
truly
out
of
hate
that
better
springs
from
the
heart
of
worse
as
calm
from
the
heaving
elements
that
all
things
born
to
the
universe
may
suffer
and
perish
utterly
hence
but
never
refute
its
innocence
off
the
irish
coast
gulls
on
the
wind
crying
crying
are
you
the
ghosts
of
erin
dead
of
the
forlorn
whose
days
went
sighing
ever
for
beauty
that
ever
fled
ever
for
light
that
never
kindled
ever
for
song
no
lips
have
sung
ever
for
joy
that
ever
dwindled
ever
for
love
that
stung
the
fairies
of
god
last
night
i
slipt
from
the
banks
of
dream
and
swam
in
the
currents
of
god
on
a
tide
where
his
fairies
were
at
play
catching
salt
tears
in
their
little
white
hands
for
human
hearts
and
dancing
dancing
in
gala
bands
on
the
currents
of
god
and
singing
singing
is
no
wind
blows
here
or
spray
wind
upon
us
only
the
waters
ripple
away
under
our
feet
as
we
gather
tears
god
has
made
mortals
for
the
years
us
for
alway
god
has
made
mortals
full
of
fears
fears
for
the
night
and
fears
for
the
day
if
they
would
free
them
of
grief
that
sears
if
they
would
keep
what
love
endears
if
they
would
lay
no
more
lilies
on
biers
let
them
say
for
we
are
swift
to
enchant
and
tire
time
will
our
feet
are
wiser
than
all
desire
our
song
is
better
than
faith
or
fame
to
whom
it
is
given
no
ill
came
who
has
it
not
grows
chill
who
has
it
not
grows
laggard
and
lame
nor
knows
that
the
world
is
a
minstrel
lyre
smitten
and
never
still
last
night
on
the
currents
of
god
the
song
of
the
homesick
gael
the
characteristic
minor
of
a
recent
literary
i
long
to
see
the
wing
over
ailsa
crag
at
dusk
again
or
girvan
gulls
at
dawn
to
see
the
osprey
grayly
glide
the
winds
of
kamasaig
for
grayness
now
my
heart
is
set
upon
the
grayness
of
where
there
loneliness
alone
save
for
the
wings
that
sweep
it
with
unrest
save
for
the
that
sound
and
die
into
a
moan
save
for
the
moaning
hunger
in
my
breast
for
grayness
is
the
hue
of
all
in
life
that
is
not
lies
a
thousand
years
of
tears
are
in
my
heart
and
only
in
their
mystery
can
i
be
truly
wise
from
light
and
laughter
follies
only
start
i
long
to
see
the
mists
again
above
the
tumbling
tide
of
ailsa
at
the
coming
of
the
night
there
weariness
and
emptiness
and
soul
unsatisfied
forever
in
the
places
of
delight
pageants
of
the
sea
what
memories
have
i
of
it
the
sea
the
sea
whose
spirit
is
a
sorcery
the
sea
whose
magic
foaming
is
immortal
what
memories
have
i
of
it
thro
the
years
what
memories
of
its
shores
of
shadowy
headlands
doomed
to
stay
the
storm
and
red
cliffs
clawing
ever
into
the
tides
of
misty
moors
whose
royal
heather
purples
of
channeled
marshes
hills
of
crags
homes
of
hungry
gulls
of
bays
where
sails
float
furled
resting
softly
at
harbour
until
winging
again
they
sweep
away
what
memories
have
i
too
of
faring
out
at
dawn
upon
tameless
waters
upon
the
infinite
wasted
yearning
of
them
while
winds
the
mystic
of
the
world
were
sounding
sweet
farewells
while
coast
and
lighthouse
tower
were
fading
fast
and
from
me
all
the
world
slipped
like
a
garment
what
memories
of
of
heaving
on
thro
haunted
vasts
of
foam
thro
swaying
terrors
of
tormented
tides
while
the
wind
no
more
singing
took
to
raving
in
rhythmic
infinite
words
a
chantey
ancient
and
immeasurable
concerning
man
and
god
what
memories
of
wide
leaden
deserts
of
dim
wavelessness
smooth
glass
as
gray
as
a
dream
upon
despair
horizon
what
sailing
soft
till
lo
the
shroud
was
lifted
and
suddenly
there
came
as
a
great
joy
the
blue
sublimity
of
summer
skies
the
azure
mystery
of
happy
heavens
the
passionate
sweet
parley
of
the
breeze
and
dancing
waves
that
lured
us
on
and
on
past
islands
above
whose
verdant
enchanted
clouds
were
hanging
and
whence
wild
spices
wandered
past
iridescent
reefs
and
vessels
bound
for
ports
unknown
o
far
far
past
until
the
sun
in
fire
an
impotent
and
shrunken
orb
lay
dying
on
heaving
twilight
purple
gathered
round
and
then
what
nights
the
phantom
moon
in
misty
resurrection
arising
from
her
sepulchre
in
the
east
and
sparkling
the
dark
waters
the
unremembering
moon
and
covenants
of
star
to
faithful
star
dewy
like
tears
of
god
across
the
sky
and
under
the
moon
fair
ring
orion
running
forever
in
great
war
adown
the
west
what
far
infinite
nights
with
where
the
lightning
slumbered
or
wakened
once
and
again
with
startled
watch
again
to
fall
asleep
and
leave
the
free
for
all
my
thoughts
to
wander
peacefully
away
and
still
away
until
the
stars
sighed
out
in
dawn
great
pallor
just
as
the
lands
of
my
desire
appeared
what
memories
have
i
of
it
a
song
of
the
old
venetians
the
seven
fleets
of
venice
set
sail
across
the
sea
for
cyprus
and
for
trebizond
ayoub
and
araby
their
gonfalons
are
floating
far
mark
has
heard
the
mass
and
to
the
noon
the
salt
lagoon
lies
white
like
burning
glass
the
seven
fleets
of
venice
and
each
its
way
to
go
led
by
a
falier
or
tron
zorzi
or
dandalo
the
patriarch
has
blessed
them
all
the
doge
has
waved
the
word
and
in
their
wings
the
murmurings
of
waiting
winds
are
heard
the
seven
fleets
of
venice
and
what
shall
be
their
fate
one
shall
return
with
porphyry
and
pearl
and
fair
agàte
one
shall
return
with
spice
and
spoil
and
silk
of
samarcand
but
nevermore
shall
win
the
sea
to
any
land
they
shall
bring
the
east
back
and
they
shall
bring
the
west
the
seven
fleets
our
venice
sets
upon
her
quest
but
some
shall
bring
despair
back
and
some
shall
leave
their
keels
deeper
than
wind
or
wave
frets
or
sun
ever
basking
give
me
a
spot
in
the
sun
with
a
lizard
basking
by
me
in
sicily
over
the
sea
where
winter
is
sweet
as
spring
where
etna
lifts
his
plume
of
curling
smoke
to
try
me
but
all
in
vain
for
i
will
not
climb
his
height
so
ravishing
give
me
a
spot
in
the
sun
so
high
on
a
cliff
that
under

down
the
flecking
sails
like
white
moths
flit
the
blue
that
over
me
on
a
crag
there
hangs
o
aëry
wonder
a
white
town
drowsing
in
its
nest
that
peep
thro
give
me
a
spot
in
the
sun
with
contadini
singing
and
a
at
his
pipes
and
donkey
bells
heard
round
upon
steep
mountain
paths
where
a
peasant
cart
comes
swinging
mid
joyous
hot
invectives
that
so
blameless
here
abound
give
me
a
spot
in
the
sun
in
a
land
whose
speech
is
flowers
whose
breath
is
whose
soul
is
still
a
faun
whose
limbs
the
sea
enlaps
thro
long
delicious
hours
with
liquid
tenderness
and
light
sweet
as
elysian
dawns
give
me
a
spot
in
the
sun
with
a
view
past
vale
and
villa
past
grottoed
isle
and
sea
to
italy
and
the
cape
around
whose
turning
lies
old
scylla
whom
may
an
ancient
sailor
prayed

gods
he
might
escape

me
a
spot
in

sun
with
sly
old
pan

lazy
as

to
me
o

and
its

o

suffered
all

sea
of

delphian
tongue

on

on

a
pharaoh
tomb
all
these
did

have
and
he
is
dead
submarine
mountains
under
the
sea
which
is
their
sky
they
rise
to
watery
altitudes
as
vast
as
those
of
far
himàlayan
peaks
impent
in
snows
and
veils
of
cloud
and
sacred
deep
repose
under
the
sea
their
flowing
firmament
more
dark
than
any
ray
of

can
pierce
the
earthquake
thrust
them
up
with
mighty
tierce
and
left
them
to
be
seen
but
by
the
eyes
of
awed
imagination
inward
bent
their
vegetation
is
the
viscid
ooze
whose
mysteries
are
past
belief
or
thought
creation
seems
around
them
or
by
some
cosmic
urgence
gone
distraught
adown
their
precipices
chill
and
dense
with
the
dank
midnight
creep
or
crawl
or
climb
such
tentacled
and
eyeless
things
of
slime
such
monster
shapes
as
tempt
us
to
accuse
life
of
a
miscreative
impotence
about
their
peaks
the
shark
their
eagle
floats
in
the
thick
azure
far
beneath
the
air
or
downward
sweeps
upon
what
prey
may
dare
set
forth
from
any
silent
weedy
lair
but
one
desire
on
all
their
slopes
is
found
desire
of
food
the
awful
hunger
strife
yet
here
it
may
be
was
begun
our
life
here
all
the
dreams
on
which
our
vision
dotes
in
unevolved
obscurity
were
bound
too
strange
it
is
too
terrible
and
yet
it
matters
not
how
we
were
wrought
or
whence
life
came
to
us
with
all
its
throb
intense
if
in
it
is
a
godly
immanence
it
matters
not
if
haply
we
are
more
than
creatures
by
a
blind
force
that
sweeps
the
universe
in
a
chance
course
for
only
in
unmeaning
might
is
met
the
intolerable
thought
none
can
ignore
the
song
of
the
come
over
the
tide
come
over
the
foam
dance
on
the
hurricane
leap
its
waves
dream
not
of
the
calm
nor
of
content
in
them
and
home
for
that
is
the
reason
the
hearts
of
men
are
ever
weary
they
would
abide
somewhere
out
of
the
spumy
stride
of
the
world
spindrift
a
want
denied
that
is
the
reason
tho
they
know
that
the
restive
years
have
no
true
home
but
only
a
whence
whither
and
when
whence
and
whither
for
hearts
to
roam
so
who
would
tarry
and
rest
the
while
not
dance
as
we
and
sing
on
the
wind
against
the
whole
flow
of
the
world
has
sinned
and
soon
is
weary
and
can
not
smile
dance
then
dance
on
the
fleeting
spray
none
can
gather
eternity
into
his
heart
and
bid
it
stay
swiftly
again
it
slips
away
dance
and
know
that
the
will
of
life
is
the
wind
will
and
the
will
of
the
tide
and
who
finds
not
a
home
in
its
strife
shall
find
no
home
on
any
side
the
great
seducer
who
looks
too
long
from
his
window
at
the
gray
wide
cold
sea
where
breakers
scour
the
beaches
with
fingers
of
sharp
foam
who
looks
too
long
thro
the
gray
pane
at
the
mad
wild
bold
sea
shall
sell
his
hearth
to
a
stranger
and
turn
his
back
on
home
who
looks
too
long
from
his
window
tho
his
wife
waits
by
the
fireside
at
a
ship
wings
in
the
offing
at
a
gull
wings
on
air
shall
latch
his
gate
behind
him
tho
his
cattle
call
from
the
and
kiss
his
wife
and
leave
her
and
wander
everywhere
who
looks
too
long
in
the
twilight
or
the
or
the
who
sees
an
anchor
lifted
and
hungers
past
content
shall
pack
his
chest
for
the
world
end
for
alien
sun
or
moonlight
and
follow
the
wind
sateless
to
disillusionment
because
the
sun
like
a
chinese
lantern
set
in
a
temple
of
clouds
tonight
i
was
back
in
because
in
a
temple
of
dragon
clouds
as
if
with
incense
misty
red
it
hung
there
over
the
rim
of
the
sea
i
was
back
in
a
narrow
street
where
amber
faces
pass
all
day
going
to
pay
going
to
pray
going
the
same
old
human
way
they
have
gone
for
a
thousand
years
men
say
in
and
i
heard
the
coolie
cry
for
his
fare
i
heard
the
merchant
praise
his
ware
of
bronze
and
porcelain
set
to
snare
in
i
saw
strange
streaming
signs
in
black
with
gold
and
crimson
on
their
back
opiate
signs
in
an
opiate
street
where
the
slip
and
patter
of
feet
is
old
as
the
sun
and
the
temple
door
as
cool
and
dark
as
the
night
and
where
dim
lanterns
swinging
there
as
a
lure
to
human
grief
and
care
half
reveal
and
half
conceal
the
ancestral
gloom
of
the
gods
i
saw
all
this
with
sudden
pang
as
if
by
hashish
swept
or
bhang
because
the
sun
like
a
chinese
lantern
set
in
a
temple
of
clouds
typhoon
i
was
weary
and
slept
on
the
peak
the
air
clung
close
like
a
shroud
and
ever
the
at
my
ear
buzzed
haunting
hot
and
loud
i
awoke
and
the
sky
was
dun
with
awe
and
a
dread
that
soon
went
shuddering
thro
my
heart
for
i
knew
that
it
meant
typhoon
typhoon
in
the
harbour
below
far
down
the
junks
like
fowl
in
a
flock
were
tossing
in
wingless
terror
or
fled
fluttering
in
from
the
shock
the
city
a
breathless
bend
of
roofs
by
the
water
strewn
lay
silent
and
waiting
yet
there
was
none
within
it
but
said
typhoon
then
it
came
like
a
million
winds
gone
mad
immeasurably
a
torrid
and
tortuous
tempest
stung
by
rape
of
the
fair
south
sea
and
it
swept
like
a
scud
escaped
from
crater
of
sun
or
moon
and
struck
as
no
power
of
heaven
could
or
of
hell
typhoon
typhoon
and
the
junks
were
smitten
and
torn
the
drowning
struggled
and
cried
or
dashed
on
the
granite
walls
of
the
sea
in
succourless
hundreds
died
till
i
shut
the
sight
from
my
eyes
and
prayed
for
my
soul
to
swoon
if
ever
i
see
god
face
let
it
be
guiltless
of
that
typhoon
penang
i
want
to
go
back
to
singapore
and
ship
along
the
straits
to
a
bungalow
i
know
beside
penang
where
cocoanut
palms
along
the
shore
are
waving
and
the
gates
of
peace
shut
sorrow
out
forevermore
i
want
to
go
back
and
hear
the
surf
come
beating
in
at
night
like
the
washing
of
eternity
over
the
dead
i
want
to
see
dawn
fare
up
and
day
go
down
in
golden
light
i
want
to
go
back
to
penang
i
want
to
go
back
i
want
to
go
back
to
singapore
and
up
along
the
straits
to
the
bungalow
that
waits
me
by
the
tide
where
the
tamil
and
malay
tell
their
lore
at
evening
and
the
fates
have
set
no
soothless
canker
at
life
core
i
want
to
go
back
and
mend
my
heart
beneath
the
tropic
moon
while
the
is
whispering
thoughts
of
sleep
i
want
to
believe
that
earth
again
with
heaven
is
in
tune
i
want
to
go
back
to
penang
i
want
to
go
back
i
want
to
go
back
to
singapore
and
ship
along
the
straits
to
the
bungalow
i
left
upon
the
strand
where
the
foam
of
the
world
grows
faint
before
it
enters
and
abates
in
meaning
as
i
hear
the
pour
i
want
to
go
back
and
end
my
days
some
evening
when
the
cross
on
the
southern
sky
hangs
heavily
far
and
sad
i
want
to
remember
when
i
die
that
life
elsewhere
was
loss
i
want
to
go
back
to
penang
i
want
to
go
back
nights
on
the
indian
ocean
nights
on
the
indian
ocean
long
nights
of
moon
and
foam
when
silvery
venus
low
in
the
sky
follows
the
sun
home
long
nights
when
the
mild
monsoon
is
breaking
and
when
soft
clouds
and
the
singing
shrouds
make
all
that
is
seem
best
nights
on
the
indian
ocean
long
nights
of
space
and
dream
when
silent
sirius
round
the
pole
swings
on
with
steady
gleam
when
oft
the
pushing
prow
seems
pressing
where
before
no
prow
has
ever
pressed
or
shall
from
hence
forevermore
nights
on
the
indian
ocean
long
nights
with
land
at
last
dim
land
dissolving
the
long
into
a
sudden
past
that
seems
as
far
away
as
this
our
life
shall
seem
when
under
the
shadow
of
death
shore
we
drop
its
ended
dream
sighting
arabia
my
heart
that
is
arabia
o
see
that
talismanic
sweep
of
sunset
coast
which
lies
like
richly
wrought
enchantment
ghost
before
us
bringing
back
youth
witchery
arabian
nights
at
last
to
us
one
comes
the
crescent
moon
upon
its
purple
brow
will
not
haroun
and
bagdad
rise
up
now
there
on
the
shore
to
beating
of
his
drums
is
not
that
gull
a
roc
that
sail
sindbad
that
rocky
pinnacle
a
minaret
does
the
wind
call
to
prayer
from
it
o
yet
i
hear
the
fancy
fervid
as
a
lad
allah
il
allah
rings
it
o
my
heart
fall
prostrate
for
to
mecca
we
are
near
that
flashing
light
is
but
a
sign
sent
clear
from
her
your
houri
as
her
curtains
part
soon
she
will
lean
out
from
her
lattice
soon
and
bid
you
climb
up
to
your
paradise
which
is
her
panting
lips
and
passion
eyes
under
the
drunken
sweetness
of
the
moon
o
heart
my
heart
drink
deeply
ere
they
die
the
sunset
dome
the
minaret
the
dreams
flashing
afar
from
youth
returnless
streams
for
we
my
heart
must
grow
old
you
and
i
all
well
i
the
illimitable
leaping
of
the
sea
the
mouthing
of
its
madness
to
the
moon
the
seething
of
its
endless
sorcery
its
prophecy
no
power
can
attune
swept
over
me
as
on
the
sounding
prow
of
a
great
ship
that
steered
into
the
stars
i
stood
and
felt
the
awe
upon
my
brow
of
death
and
destiny
and
all
that
mars
ii
the
wind
that
blew
from
cassiopeia
cast
wanly
upon
my
ear
a
rune
that
rung
the
sailor
in
his
eyrie
on
the
mast
sang
an
all
well
that
to
the
spirit
clung
like
a
lost
voice
from
some
aërial
realm
where
ships
sail
on
forever
to
no
shore
where
time
gives
immortality
the
helm
and
fades
like
a
far
phantom
from
life
door
iii
and
is
all
well
o
thou
unweariable
who
launchest
worlds
upon
bewildered
space
rose
in
me
all
or
did
thy
hand
grow
dull
building
this
world
that
bears
a
piteous
race
o
was
it
launched
too
soon
or
launched
too
late
or
can
it
be
a
derelict
that
drifts
beyond
thy
ken
toward
some
reef
of
fate
on
which
oblivion
sand
forever
shifts
iv
the
sea
grew
softer
as
i
questioned
calm
with
mystery
that
like
an
answer
moved
and
from
infinity
there
fell
a
balm
the
old
peace
that
god
tho
all
unproved
the
old
faith
that
tho
gulfs
sidereal
stun
the
soul
and
knowledge
drown
within
their
deep
there
is
no
world
that
wanders
no
not
one
of
all
the
millions
that
he
does
not
keep
somnambulism
i
night
is
above
me
and
night
is
above
the
night
the
sea
is
beside
me
soughing
or
is
still
the
earth
as
a
somnambulist
moves
on
in
a
strange
sleep
a
cries
and
the
cry
wakes
in
me
dim
dead
my
sires
who
more
than
myself
are
me
who
sat
on
their
beach
long
nights
ago
and
saw
the
sea
in
its
silence
and
cursed
it
or
implored
or
with
the
cross
defied
then
on
the
morrow
in
their
boats
went
down
ii
night
is
above
me
and
night
is
above
the
night
rocks
are
about
me
and
beyond
the
sand
and
the
low
reluctant
tide
that
rushes
back
to
ebb
a
last
farewell
to
the
flotsam
borne
so
long
upon
its
breast
rocks
but
the
tide
is
out
and
the
slime
lies
naked
like
a
thing
ashamed
that
has
no
and
the
hushes
the
bird
and
all
far
cries
within
my
blood
and
earth
as
a
somnambulist
moves
on
chartings
there
is
no
moon
only
the
sea
and
stars
there
is
no
land
only
the
vessel
bow
on
which
i
stand
alone
and
wonder
how
men
ever
dream
of
ports
beyond
the
bars
of
finitude
that
fix
the
here
and
now
a
meteor
falls
and
foam
beneath
me
breaks
dim
phosphor
fires
within
it
faintly
die
so
soft
the
sea
is
that
it
seems
a
sky
on
which
eternity
to
life
awakes
the
universe
is
spread
before
my
face
worlds
where
perchance
a
million
seas
like
this
are
flowing
and
where
tides
of
pain
and
bliss
find
as
on
earth
so
prevalent
a
place
that
nothing
of
their
wont
we
there
should
miss
the
universe
that
man
has
dared
to
say
is
but
one
being
ah
courageous
thought
which
is
so
vast
that
hope
itself
is
fraught
with
shame
while
saying
it
and
shrinks
away
shrinks
even
as
now
for
clouds
sweep
up
the
skies
and
darken
the
wide
waters
circling
round
from
out
whose
deep
arises
the
old
sound
of
terror
unto
which
no
tongue
replies
but
faith
that
nothing
ever
shall
confound
not
only
pagan
perseus
but
the
cross
is
shrouded
with
wild
wind
and
wilder
rain
that
on
me
beat
until
my
soul
again
sings
unsurrendering
to
fears
of
loss
for
this
i
know
yea
tho
all
else
lie
hid
uncharted
on
the
waters
of
our
fate
all
lands
of
whence
or
whither
whose
estate
in
vain
imagination
seeks
to
thrid
yet
can
not
for
the
fog
within
death
gate
this
thing
i
know
that
life
whatever
its
source
or
destiny
comes
with
an
upward
urge
and
that
we
can
not
thwart
its
mighty
surge
but
with
a
joy
in
strife
must
keep
the
course
the
trail
from
the
sea
i
took
the
trail
to
the
wooded
canyon
the
trail
from
the
sea
for
i
heard
a
calling
in
me
a
landward
calling
irresistible
in
me
done
with
things
of
the
sea
things
of
the
soul
have
done
with
waters
that
slip
away
from
under

done
with
things
faithless
things
unfathomable
and
vain

the
vast
deeps
of

the
foam
of

and
mysteries
for
a
season

done
with
infinite
yearnings
cast
adrift
on
infinite
vagueness

for

drifting

wild
roses
with

bedrenched
have
come
from

abated
at

songs
to
i
minglings
it

old

the
moonlit
sea
and
you
i
can
not
make
disseverance
between
the
two
for
all
the

wide
beauty
to
me
you
seem
all
that
i
love
in

it
is
the
old
old
murmur
the
sea
sound
and
your
voice
god
in
his
bliss

make
no

oh
the

is
very
wide
but
you
are
nigh
the

come
out
from
zone
to
zone
the
wind
knows
every

and
blows
their
message
to
my
heart
as
it
has
ever
done
they
are
all
god
it
tells
me
all
however
huge
or
high
but
ah
i
could
not
trust
its
call
were
you
not
by
iii
recompense
not
if
i
chose
from
a
world
of
days
could
i
find
a
day
like
this
the
sky
is
a
wreath
of
azure
haze
and
the
sea
an
azure
bliss
the
surf
runs
racing
the
young
salt
wind
shouting
without
a
fear
over
reef
bar
cliff
and
scaur
where
you
and
i
lie
near
o
you
and
i
who
have
watched
the
sky
and
sea
from
many
a
shore
you
love
and
i
who
will
live
and
die
and
watch
the
sea
no
more
o
joy
of
the
world
joy
of
love
joy
that
can
say
to
death
tho
you
end
all
with
your
wanton
pall
we
two
have
had
this
breath
iv
at
the
as
i
hear
thro
the
midnight
sighing
the
low
withdrawn
and
gulls
on
the
dark
cliff
crying
for
far
discernless
dawn
it
seems
that
all
life
is
lying
within
your
every
breath
yet
i
can
not
believe
in
dying
or
death
as
i
hear
from
the
gray
church
tower
the
bell
unfailing
sound
peal
forth
hour
after
hour
to
night
lone
reaches
round
it
seems
as
if
time
wan
power
would
sear
all
things
apace
all
save
in
my
heart
one
flower
your
face
v
in
a
dark
hour
you
are
not
with
me
only
the
moon
the
sea
and
the
gulls
cry
out
of
tune
the
myriad
cry
of
the
gulls
still
strewn
on
the
sands
where
the
tide
will
enter
soon
you
are
not
with
me
only
the
breath
of
the
wind
and
then
the
wind
death
a
shrouding
silence
then
that
saith
even
as
wind
love
vanisheth
you
are
not
with
me
only
fear
as
old
as
earth
first
frenzied
bier
that
severed
two
whose
hearts
were
near
and
left
one
with
all
life
unclear
vi
via
amorosa
when
we
two
walk
my
love
on
the
path
the
moon
makes
over
the
sea
to
the
end
of
the
world
where
sorrow
hath
an
end
that
is
ecstasy
should
we
not
think
of
the
other
road
of
wearying
dust
and
stone
our
feet
would
fare
did
each
but
care
to
follow
the
way
alone
when
we
two
slip
at
night
to
the
skies
and
find
one
star
that
we
keep
as
a
to
which
our
eyes
may
lead
our
souls
ere
sleep
should
we
not
pause
for
a
little
space
and
think
how
many
must
sigh
because
they
gaze
over
starry
ways
with
no
by
when
we
two
then
lie
down
to
our
dreams
that
deepen
still
the
delight
of
our
wandering
where
stars
and
streams
stray
in
immortal
light
should
we
not
grieve
with
the
myriads
from
east
of
earth
to
west
who
lay
them
down
at
night
but
to
drown
a
longing
for
some
loved
breast
ah
yes
for
life
has
a
thousand
gifts
but
love
it
is
gives
life
who
walks
thro
his
world
in
loneness
lifts
a
soul
that
is
but
they
to
whom
it
is
given
to
tread
the
and
not
sink
can
ever
say
the
unhappiest
way
earth
has
is
fair
to
the
brink
vii
transfusion
a
flashes
east
and
livid
lightning
west
the
silvery
dark
between
on
which
we
ride
at
rest
and
gaze
far
far
away
into
the
fretless
skies
in
our
thought
but
ah
content
within
our
eyes
the
ship
bell
strikes
the
sound
floats
shrouded
to
our
ears
then
suddenly
as
at
a
touch
the
universe
appears
a
presence
infinite
that
penetrates
our
love
and
makes
us
one
with
night
and
sea
and
all
the
stars
above
need
of
storm
on
the
green
floor
of
the
gulf
the
wind
is
walking
printing
it
with
invisible
feet
the
tide
is
talking
purple
and
grey
the
horizon
walls
them
round
with
purpler
clouds
they
wander
in
it
like
guests
gently
astray
in
a
house
deep
mystery
shrouds
i
do
not
know
the
speech
of
the
tide
for
too
articulate
have
become
my
years
beauty
brings
only
words
not
breathless
tears
so
the
young
heron
fishing
there
in
the
foam
on
the
sand
edge
would
once
have
taken
my
spirit
far
far
home
to
the
infinite
when
he
vanished
thro
the
gloam
but
now
i
am
left
behind
on
the
beach
a
shell
that
no
more
knows
the
wonder
of
the
sea
swell
or
more
than
the
empty
echo
of
its
knell
to
sea
then
life
wildly
to
sea
with
a
storm
sweep
me
again
from
the
smooth
dull
beach
of
custom
where
i
lie
that
i
may
feel
once
more
the
swaying
surge
of
passion
thro
me
swarm
a
florida
interlude
i
behind
me
lie
the
everglades
the
mystic
grassy
everglades
where
the
moccasin
and
the
seminole
glide
in
secret
silent
indian
ways
before
me
lies
the
gulf
the
cup
of
blue
bright
tropic
waters
held
to
the
parched
lips
of
the
south
to
cool
and
quench
its
thirst
behind
me
lie
the
everglades
before
me
lies
the
gulf
which
the
sunset
soon
shall
change
to
wine
a
eucharist
for
the
longing
soul
its
rim
of
land
shall
be
transformed
to
mexic
opal
and
chrysoprase
and
then
shall
come
the
moon
as
calm
as
a
thought
of
christ
as
calm
as
a
thought
of
christ
over
the
cup
enchased
with
palm
and
pine
floridian
friends
saying
their
twilight
litanies
while
homeward
flies
the
heron
to
his
island
cypress
in
the
swamp
which
spanish
mosses
drape
and
the
moon
silverly
soothes
to
peace
ii
behind
me
lie
the
everglades
where
the
bittern
wails
to
the
moon
face
peace
is
gone
as
i
wake
and
memory
in
me
wails
from
the
primal
swamp
heredity
whence
i
have
come
with
all
the
desires
of
creeping
walking
flying
things
to
creep
or
walk
or
fly
with
all
the
desires
of
the
yet
with
a
want
transcendent
a
want
that
comes
with
the
glimmer
of
stars
and
pierces
to
my
heart
a
want
of
the
life
i
have
not
known
of
the
life
unknowable
in
the
everglades
of
the
universe
where
the
great
spirit
glides
a
florida
boating
song
down
thro
florida
keys
from
island
to
island
down
thro
florida
keys
where
mangrove
roots
dip
in
the
seas
a
myriad
tangled
roots
from
each
palmetto
byland
roots
mid
which
the
heron
wades
in
the
shallow
shades
down
thro
florida
keys
around
them
between
them
thro
low
green
florida
keys
so
low
they
scarce
seem
born
of
the
seas
where
pouchy
pelicans
roost
on
cypresses
that
lean
them
out
over
the
idle
lap
of
the
tide
that
comes
and
goes
with
balmy
flows
down
thro
florida
keys
thro
mazes
on
mazes
of
keys
where
sun
and
wind
play
as
they
please
where
the
eaglet
high
in
air
or
the
wild
white
ibis
dazes
eyes
that
follow
them
up
the
blue
as
the
heart
would
do
the
heart
too
down
thro
florida
keys
i
going
i
going
thro
low
green
florida
keys
and
greener
glades
of
florida
seas
and
this
is
all
i
know
that
all
in
the
world
worth
knowing
is
joy
like
that
of
the
tarpon
leap
in
air
divine
with
the
warm
sunshine
i
went
out
at
dawn
pelicans
were
fishing
grey
and
brown
little
waves
were
swishing
clouds
creamed
the
sky
as
shells
creamed
the
shore
wild
aery
hues
of
beauty
round
seemed
to
pour
i
went
out
at
dawn
pelicans
were
floating
big
beaks
on
their
breasts
up
the
sun
came
boating
ship
ahoy
i
cried
to
his
golden
sail
of
beauty
in
me
broke
to
a
gale
i
went
out
at
dawn
pelicans
were
winging
palms
waved
passion
plumes
beach
sands
were
singing
stripped
save
of
strength
i
plunged
into
the
sea
and
swam
till
the
bliss
of
beauty
died
away
in
me
atavism
i
leant
out
over
a
ledging
cliff
and
looked
down
into
the
sea
where
weed
and
kelp
and
dulse
swayed
in
green
translucency
where
the
abalone
clung
to
the
rock
and
the
lay
about
purpling
the
sands
that
slid
away
under
the
silver
trout
and
the
too
was
there
and
the
it
was
a
world
of
watery
shapes
and
hues
and
wizardry
and
i
felt
old
stirrings
wake
in
me
under
the
tides
of
time
i
had
brought
with
me
out
of
the
ancient
slime
and
now
as
i
muse
i
can
not
rid
my
senses
of
the
spell
that
in
a
tidal
trance
all
things
around
me
drift
and
swell
under
the
sea
of
the
universe
down
into
which
strange
eyes
keep
peering
at
me
as
i
peered
with
wonder
and
surmise
two
years
have
gone
and
again
i
stand
on
the
bow
of
a
mighty
ship
that
pushes
her
way
sea
and
stars
with
soft
and
dreamy
dip
two
years
of
labouring
heart
and
hand
of
waging
of
wondering
ever
what
life
is
and
if
death
heals
its
scars
two
years
and
again
the
sounds
above
me
with
a
low
voice
as
ghostly
as
the
white
that
breaks
with
the
old
noise
of
waters
that
have
washed
all
bounds
of
earth
that
is
man
home
his
ark
on
the
wide
ether
flung
unrestingly
to
roam
for
even
as
we
is
this
our
earth
an
endless
wanderer
far
down
a
universe
with
vast
strange
voyagings
astir
and
where
time
ever
brings
to
birth
a
craving
never
past
to
fare
from
where
we
are
to
where
no
anchor
ever
was
cast
a
craving
in
the
mote
the
man
the
mollusc
and
the
star
a
yearning
on
o
life
o
life
how
far
leads
it
how
far
all
unbelievably
began
our
voyage
mid
a
strange
strife
that
meaningless
yet
seems
to
mean
it
is
with
wisdom
rife
but
if
it
is
not
shall
we
say
let
man
scuttle
his
ship
and
drown
in
universal
death
the
griefs
that
at
him
grip
no
for
no
surety
rests
therein
to
certain
end
of
breath
he
can
but
let
hope
set
the
course
his
soul
foretokeneth
to
the
afternoon
moon
at
sea
take
care
o
wisp
of
a
moon
vague
on
the
sunny
blue
above
the
sea
or
the
gull
flying
across
you
will
pierce
your
shape
with
a
sharp
wing
take
care
or
the
wind
will
wilt
you
as
he
does
the
clouds
snowily
drifting
by
you
and
diffuse
you
over
the
sky
a
silvery
mist
to
give
more
cool
to
the
day
take
care
so
near
the
horizon
or
a
phantom
skipper
one
who
has
long
been
drowned
will
reach
above
it
and
seize
you
and
make
you
his
sail
to
circle
the
world
forever
take
care
take
care
for
frailty
is
the
prey
of
the
strong
and
you
a
wraith
of
it
have
yet
a
long
while
to
go
before
nightfall
brings
you
to
sure
effulgence
paths
crushing
in
my
hand
the
bay
as
i
pass
drinking
in
its
fragrance
with
the
sea
scent
while
write
poems
white
and
fast
on
the
blue
sky
that
is
soft
with
content
crushing
in
my
hand
the
bay
and
the
juniper
while
i
record
each
line
the
gulls
write
i
go
by
sea
paths
down
to
the
sea
edge
i
go
by
heart
paths
deep
into
delight
simple
is
my
joy
as
the
little
sandpiper
who
follows
beside
me
with
silvery
song
blither
than
the
breeze
that
skims
great
billows
nor
knows
how
deep
is
their
flow
or
strong
simple
is
my
joy
a
sunny
full
of
mysteries
there
are
and
miseries
beneath
it
but
sunk
like
wrecks
far
down
in
the
deep
from
a
northern
beach
is
it
because
for
a
million
years
the
tide
has
entered
here
from
cold
north
seas
where
freeze
that
ever
unto
my
ear
primordial
loneness
in
its
voice
comes
telling
of
that
time
when
life
was
not
upon
the
earth
but
only
is
it
because
these
granite
rocks
i
share
with
weed
and
scurf
were
held
so
long
by
the
that
now
they
take
the
surf
so
selflessly
and
soullessly
as
if
god
immanence
had
been
pressed
from
them
never
more
to
enter
with
sweet
sense
and
is
it
because
i
too
evolved
from
ice
and
sea
and
shore
can
understand
how
life
has
spanned
the
lifeless
ages
that
as
i
sit
here
suddenly
the
tide
again
seems
stilled
and
earth
beneath
a
great
white
pall
again
lies
changed
and
chilled
so
it
must
be
ah
so
for
soft
within
my
muted
brain
the
heritage
of
age
on
age
reverberates
again
wherefore
when
glacial
silence
comes
with
death
shall
i
emerge
from
that
as
from
the
frozen
past
under
life
endless
urge
passage
a
dark
sail
like
a
wing
where
the
sunset
was
the
moon
soon
will
silver
its
sinewy
flight
thro
the
night
watches
and
the
far
flight
of
those
immortal
migrants
the
stars
aleen
the
long
line
of
the
foaming
coast
is
muffled
by
the
fog
gray
ghost
i
cross
the
league
of
sea
between
and
lift
the
latch
and
kiss
aleen
she
throws
a
log
upon
the
fire
i
draw
her
to
me
nigh
and
nigher
she
does
not
know
what
a
brief
time
ago
it
was
my
arms
held
crime
the
surf
is
beating
on
the
shore
we
hear
our
own
more
she
speaks
of
and
my
reply
is
silence
does
she
wonder
why
i
do
not
love
him
have
no
fear
her
whisper
is
against
my
ear
at
last
i
have
no
fear
say
i
she
starts
as
at
a
cry
and
then
she
sees
red
on
my
coat
a
cry
throbs
in
her
throat
the
fog
sweeps
by
the
window
pane
her
sight
is
fixed
on
one
dull
stain
i
rise
and
light
my
pipe
and
go
leaving
her
standing
staring
so
the
wind
means
storm
i
think
but
more
than
that
will
make
her
white
and
yet
had
it
been
yesterday
she
said
those
words
i
still
could
pray
there
would
be
still
a
god
above
for
two
now
overwhelmed
to
love
to
a
solitary
lone
white
gull
with
sickle
wings
you
reap
for
the
heart
inscrutable
things
sorrow
of
mists
and
surf
of
the
shore
winds
that
sigh
of
the
nevermore
fret
of
foam
and
flurry
of
rain
swept
far
over
the
troubled
tide
maths
of
mystery
and
grey
pain
the
sea
voice
ever
yields
beside
lone
white
gull
you
reap
for
the
heart
life
most
sad
and
inscrutable
part
ineffable
things
the
little
is
gone
and
the
summer
is
nearly
ended
the
rill
of
his
song
was
a
happy
rift
in
the
surging
sound
of
the
sea
the
swallow
is
lingering
on
and
the
silvery
swift
sandpiper
and
i
tho
i
know
my
saddened
heart
has
lost
an
ineffable
thing
that
summer
no
more
can
bring
with
the
first
that
flung
their
scent
to
me
by
the
billows
i
twined
some
faith
some
trust
as
glad
as
the
sparrow
song
and
the
terns
that
darted
among
the
tides
seemed
weaving
for
me
impalpable
wings
of
peace
and
hope
that
now
have
taken
flight
beyond
the
day
and
the
night
ah
life
you
have
known
my
plea
for
sun
and
the
tide
of
fortune
for
winds
to
waken
my
sail
and
bear
me
joyously
over
the
world
know
too
how
much
of
your
fog
and
storm
and
rain
i
will
suffer
if
only
you
do
not
sweep
from
me
the
dear
ineffable
things
to
which
your
fragrance
clings
the
song
of
a
many
are
on
the
sea
with
all
sails
set
the
tide
rolls
in
a
restive
gray
the
wind
blows
wet
the
gull
is
weary
of
his
wings
and
i
am
weary
of
all
things
heavy
upon
me
longing
lies
my
sad
eyes
gaze
across
sad
leagues
that
sink
and
rise
and
sink
always
my
life
has
sunk
and
risen
so
i
have
it
cease
awhile
to
flow
waves
the
evening
sails
come
home
with
twilight
in
their
wings
the
across
the
gloam
springs
the
wind
sings
the
waves
begin
to
tell
the
sea
weaving
within
their
ancient
spell
more
than
earth
lore
the
rising
moon
wafts
strange
low
lures
across
the
tide
on
which
my
dim
thoughts
seem
to
range
stride
upon
stride
until
with
flooding
thrill
they
seem
at
last
to
blend
with
waves
that
from
the
eternal
will
wend
without
end
in
a
storm
a
all
day
long
in
the
spindrift
swinging
bird
of
the
sea
bird
of
the
sea
how
i
would
that
i
had
thy
winging
how
i
envy
thee
how
i
would
that
i
had
thy
spirit
so
to
careen
joyous
to
cry
over
the
storm
and
never
fear
it
into
the
night
that
hovers
near
it
calm
on
a
reeling
sky
all
day
long
and
the
night
unresting
ah
i
believe
thy
every
breath
means
that
life
best
comes
ever
breasting
peril
and
pain
and
death
after
their
parting
woman
you
know
that
rock
on
a
rocky
coast
where
the
moon
came
up
a
ruined
ghost
distorted
until
her
shape
almost
seemed
breaking
came
up
like
a
phantom
silently
and
dropped
her
shroud
on
the
red
night
sea
then
walked
a
spectral
mystery
unwaking
you
know
how
sudden
there
came
a
change
when
she
had
left
the
sea
low
range
its
lurid
crimson
stark
and
strange
behind
her
how
sudden
her
silver
self
shone
thro
tranquilly
free
of
the
earth
stained
hue
and
found
a
way
where
the
clouds
were
few
to
bind
her
you
know
this
then
go
back
some
day
when
i
have
gone
the
moonless
way
to
that
dark
rock
whereon
we
lay
and
waited
and
when
the
moon
has
arisen
free
your
soiling
doubt
shall
fall
from
me
and
eased
of
unrest
your
heart
shall
be
and
sated
a
word
magic
do
you
remember
etajima
and
how
upon
a
sea
as
ghostly
as
ever
a
tide
shall
be
we
passed
an
island
silently
and
how
a
low
voice
in
the
gloom
of
the
temple
leaning
there
said
to
one
somewhere
unseen
in
the
air
just
but
it
seemed
the
soul
of
all
farewells
that
night
the
sigh
of
all
withdrawn
delight
the
sound
of
love
last
and
now
after
long
years
it
comes
again
from
isles
of
memory
to
bring
once
more
to
birth
in
me
the
breath
of
all
lost
witchery
yes
one
low
word
of
parting
now
echoing
thro
the
fog
of
years
has
touched
my
heart
with
beauty
tears
and
youth
thro
all
things
reappears
sea
rhapsody
of
never
again
never
again
did
i
hope
to
breathe
such
joy
the
sea
is
blue
and
the
winds
halloo
up
to
the
sun
ahoy
ahoy
they
shout
and
the
mists
they
rout
from
the
go
streaming
in
happy
play
where
the
gulls
sway
and
a
million
waves
are
gleaming
and
every
wave
billowing
brave
is
tipped
with
a
wild
delight
a
garden
of
isles
around
me
smiles
bathed
in
the
blue
noon
light
the
rude
brown
bunk
of
the
fishing
junk
seems
fair
as
a
palace
o
wine
of
the
sky
the
gods
have
spilt
out
of
its
crystal
chalice
for
wine
is
the
wind
wine
the
sea
wine
for
the
sinking
spirit
to
lift
it
up
from
the
cling
of
clay
into
high
bliss
or
near
it
so
let
me
drink
till
i
cease
to
think
and
know
with
a
sting
of
rapture
that
joy
is
yet
as
wide
as
the
world
for
men
at
last
to
capture
in
an
oriental
harbour
all
the
ships
of
the
world
come
here
rest
a
little
then
set
to
sea
some
ride
up
to
the
waiting
pier
some
drop
anchor
beyond
the
quay
some
have
funnels
of
blue
and
black
some
come
once
but
come
not
back
some
have
funnels
of
red
and
yellow
some
o
war
have
funnels
of
gray
all
the
ships
of
the
world
come
here
ships
from
every
billow
foam
fruiter
and
oiler
pirateer
liner
and
lugger
and
tramp
some
are
scented
of
palm
and
pine
some
are
fain
for
the
pole
far
clime
some
are
scented
of
soy
and
senna
some
ah
me
are
scented
of
home
all
the
ships
of
the
world
come
here
day
and
night
there
is
sound
of
bells
seeking
the
port
they
calmly
steer
clearing
the
port
they
ring
farewells
under
the
sun
or
under
the
stars
under
the
light
of
swaying
spars
under
the
moon
or
under
morning
do
they
swing
as
the
tide
swells
all
the
ships
of
the
world
come
here
rest
a
little
and
then
are
gone
over
the
crystal
swept
thro
every
season
on
swept
to
every
cape
and
isle
every
coast
of
cloud
or
smile
swept
till
over
them
sweeps
the
sorrow
of
their
last
under
the
sky
far
out
to
sea
go
the
fishing
junks
with
all
sails
set
the
tide
swings
gray
and
the
clouds
sway
the
wind
blows
wet
blows
wet
from
the
long
coast
lying
dim
as
if
far
out
they
sail
as
the
stars
pale
the
stars
of
morn
far
out
to
sea
go
the
fishing
junks
and
i
who
pass
upon
a
deck
that
is
vaster
reck
no
more
alas
of
all
their
life
or
they
of
mine
than
comes
to
this
that
under
the
sky
we
live
and
die
like
all
that
is
a
song
for
healing
the
south
when
i
return
to
the
world
again
the
world
of
fret
and
fight
to
grapple
with
godless
things
and
men
in
battle
wrong
or
right
i
will
remember
this
the
sea
and
the
white
stars
hanging
high
and
the
vessel
bow
where
calmly
now
i
gaze
to
the
boundless
sky
when
i
am
deaf
with
the
din
of
strife
and
blind
amid
despair
when
i
am
choked
with
the
dust
of
life
and
long
for
free
i
will
recall
this
sound
the
sea
and
the
wide
horizon
hope
and
the
wind
that
blows
and
the
phosphor
snows
that
fall
as
the
cleft
waves
ope
when
i
am
beaten
when
i
fall
on
the
bed
of
black
defeat
when
i
have
hungered
and
in
gall
have
got
but
shame
to
eat
i
will
remember
this
the
sea
and
its
tide
as
soft
as
sleep
and
the
clear
night
sky
that
heals
for
aye
all
who
will
trust
its
deep
a
singhalese
love
lament
as
the
that
pines
my
love
away
from
the
sound
of
the
planter
voice
am
i
for
i
hear
no
more
resound
your
song
by
the
sea
the
sun
may
come
and
the
moon
wax
round
and
in
its
beam
my
mates
may
rejoice
but
i
feast
not
and
my
heart
is
dumb
as
i
long
o
long
for
thee
in
the
where
the
cobra
creeps
the
leopard
lies
in
wait
for
me
but
o
my
love
when
the
daylight
dies
there
is
more
to
my
dread
than
he
harsh
lonely
tears
that
assail
my
eyes
are
worse
to
bear
for
the
misery
that
makes
them
well
is
the
long
long
years
that
i
moan
away
from
thee
o
again
again
in
my
katamaran
would
i
push
to
your
palmy
door
again
would
i
hear
the
heave
and
hush
of
your
song
by
the
but
far
away
do
i
toil
and
crush
the
hopes
that
arise
at
my
sick
heart
core
for
never
near
does
it
come
the
day
that
draws
me
again
to
thee
the
city
soft
and
fair
by
the
desert
edge
and
on
the
dim
blue
edge
of
the
sea
where
white
gulls
wing
all
day
and
fledge
their
young
on
the
high
cliff
sandy
ledge
there
is
a
city
i
have
beheld
sometime
or
where
by
day
or
dream
i
know
not
which
for
it
seems
enspelled
as
i
am
by
its
memory
pale
minarets
of
the
prophet
pierce
above
it
into
the
white
of
the
skies
and
sails
enchanted
a
thousand
years
flit
at
its
feet
while
fancy
steers
no
face
of
all
its
faces
to
me
is
known
no
passion
of
it
or
pain
it
is
but
a
city
by
the
sea
enshrined
forever
beyond
my
eyes
full
tide
scents
bay
and
barberry
too
drench
the
wind
the
maine
wind
that
gulls
are
dipping
thro
with
soft
hints
sweet
hints
with
lull
lure
and
desire
with
and
mysteries
and
all
the
ineffable
histories
made
when
the
sea
and
land
meet
and
the
sun
lends
nuptial
fire
and
and
which
is
which
who
knows
when
all
day
long
the
heart
goes
out
to
every
wave
that
blows
that
blossoms
on
the
bright
tide
then
sheds
a
shimmering
crest
and
yields
its
tossing
place
to
one
whose
blooming
is
as
quickly
done
for
beauty
is
ever
swift
begot
of
rapture
and
unrest
and
and
where
shall
faith
be
found
if
not
within
the
heart
beat
or
in
the
surging
sound
of
the
sea
which
is
the
earth
heart
beating
with
tireless
might
beating
tho
but
a
tragedy
life
seems
on
every
land
and
sea
beating
to
bring
all
breath
somehow
out
of
despair
blight
the
herding
quietly
quietly
in
from
the
fields
of
the
grey
atlantic
the
billows
come
like
sheep
to
the
fold
shorn
by
the
rocks
of
fleecy
foam
they
sink
on
the
brown
seaweed
at
home
and
a
bell
like
that
of
a
bellwether
is
scarcely
heard
from
the
buoy
save
when
they
suddenly
stumble
together
in
herded
hurrying
joy
upon
its
guidance
then
soft
music
from
it
is
tolled
far
out
in
the
murk
that
follows
them
in
is
heard
the
call
of
the
voice
like
a
shepherd
low
and
the
strays
as
if
waiting
it
seem
to
pause
and
lift
their
heads
and
listen
because
it
is
sweet
from
wandering
ways
to
be
driven
when
we
have
fearless
breasts
when
all
that
we
strayed
for
has
been
given
when
no
want
molests
us
more
no
need
of
the
tide
ebbing
and
tide
flow
on
the
maine
coast
the
rocks
lean
fingers
of
the
land
reach
out
into
the
sea
and
cool
themselves
all
day
long
in
the
tide
drippingly
they
catch
the
seaweed
in
them
and
the
starfish
on
their
tips
and
gulls
that
light
and
the
swift
flight
of
swallows
skimming
grey
and
white
and
spars
of
broken
ships
the
moon
god
perfect
silver
with
which
he
pays
the
world
for
toil
and
quest
and
day
unrest
is
washed
on
them
and
swirled
and
avidly
they
seize
it
then
let
it
slip
away
only
again
and
yet
again
to
grasp
at
it
as
eager
men
at
joy
no
hand
can
stay
seance
hovering
wings
of
terns
over
the
flutter
for
the
tide
ebbed
far
out
seems
to
stumble
and
stutter
seems
like
a
spirit
lost
unable
to
come
again
back
to
the
wonted
ways
and
days
of
men
and
the
moon
a
medium
is
laying
her
light
over
its
surge
till
lo
it
turns
from
the
deep
and
night
and
the
it
brings
is
the
message
of
all
time
that
doubt
is
only
the
ebb
of
faith
which
ever
reflows
sublime
a
sidmouth

for
thy

prepare

back

plunged

three
waves
of

pale

sighing

had

yea
i
for
the

is
to
me
but
sea
and

but
infinity
tides
and

are
but
some
chance
born
of
a
primal
all
is
a

of
circumstance
in
it
there
is
no

no

no

goal
only
wild
happenings
by
wont
made
into
laws
no
might
can
shunt
from
the
deep
grooves
in
which
they
hunt
wings
of
the
gull
i

or
claws
of
the
cold
crab
whose
strangeness
awes
faces
of
men
that
feel
the
force
of
a
hid
thing
they
call
life
course
it
is
their
hoping
or
remorse
yet
it
may
be
that
i
have
missed
something
that
only
they
who
tryst
not
with
the
sequence
of
events
but
with
their
viewless
immanence
find
and
acclaim
with
at
the
helm
fog
and
a
wind
that
blows
the
sea
blindly
into
my
eyes
and
i
know
not
if
my
soul
shall
be
when
the
day
dies
but
if
it
be
not
and
i
lose
all
that
men
live
to
gain
i
who
have
known
but
heaving
hues
of
wind
and
rain
still
i
shall
envy
no
man
lot
for
i
have
held
this
great
never
in
whines
to
have
forgot
that
fate
is
fate
imperturbable
three
times
the
fog
rolled
in
today
a
silent
shroud
from
which
the
breakers
ran
like
ghosts
moaning
and
tumbling
three
times
a
startled
cried
aloud
on
the
wind
stumbling
but
i
cast
my
net
with
never
a
fear
tho
wraiths
in
me
and
birds
of
wild
unrest
were
stirring
and
starting
and
crying
for
i
knew
that
under
the
sway
of
every
sea
there
is
calm
lying
waste
i
flung
a
wild
rose
into
the
sea
i
know
not
why
for
swinging
there
on
a
rathe
by
the
scented
bay
and
barberry
its
petals
gave
all
their
sweet
to
me
as
i
passed
by
and
yet
i
flung
it
into
the
tide
and
went
my
way
i
climbed
the
gray
rocks
far
and
wide
and
many
a
cove
of
peace
i
tried
with
none
of
them
all
to
be
satisfied
the
whole
long
day
for
i
had
wasted
a
beautiful
thing
which
might
have
won
each
passing
heart
to
pause
and
sing
on
the
there
of
its
blossoming
and
who
wastes
beauty
shall
feel
want
sting
as
i
had
done
resurgence
i
was
content
o
sea
to
be
free
for
a
space
from
striving
content
as
the
brown
weed
is
at
rest
on
rocks
in
the
sun
when
the
salt
tide
is
out
and
the
surf
no
more
is
riving
at
its
roots
or
swirling
and
bidding
it
sway
where
the
white
waves
run
i
was
content
with
life
and
love
and
a
little
over
a
little
achieved
of
the
much
that
is
given
to
men
to
do
but
now
with
your
tidal
strife
do
you
come
again
vain
rover
and
tell
of
vastitudes
to
be
sailed
or
sounded
anew
now
again
do
you
surge
and
the
fathomless
tides
of
thinking
of
wanting
waiting
despairing
or
daring
with
you
come
the
inner
tides
of
the
soul
that
had
ebbed
with
slumberous
shrinking
but
now
are
bursting
again
thro
the
caves
of
it
long
numb
so
vainly
i
lie
on
the
cliff
with
the
blissful
blue
above
me
and
listless
sated
gulls
afloat
below
on
the
swells
for
i
am
soothless
sateless
because
of
desires
that
shove
me
out
and
away
with
the
winds
on
quests
no
distance
quells
life
answer
a
stroke
of
lightning
stabbed
the
sea
as
if
it
sought
the
heart
of
life
thereunder
and
meant
to
put
an
end
to
it
utterly
then
came
thunder
wildly
applauding
thunder
riven
with
fear
the
ran
before
it
hissed
by
the
rain
and
beaten
down
to
darkness
a
gull
rose
out
of
the
murk
with
wings
that
tore
it
life
answer
to
the
storm
terrible
starkness
as
the
tide
comes
in
the
quivering
terns
dart
wild
and
dive
as
the
tide
