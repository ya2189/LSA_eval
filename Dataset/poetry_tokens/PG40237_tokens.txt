in
all
its
weal

woe
they
held
their

the
charm

pride
of
earliest
youth
a
chastening
touch
had
toned
to
lovelier
hue
and
the

purity

looked

your

he

i
can
not
share
it
all
the
hoary
past
denies
that
mightier
prowess
of
the
pen
the
poet
claims
and
proves
it
still
surpassed
by
sword
and
musket
and
the
arts
of
war
and
not
so
the
query
will
return
albeit
such
conflict
we
must
all
abhor
how
should
the
fires
of
patriotism
burn
their
flames
are
kindled
by
the
flash
of
arms
and
fed
by
recount
of
heroic
deed
the
sanguinary
story
has
its
charms
tho
the
heart
sicken
it
as
we
read
and
what
were
greece
without
her
marathon
or
rome
had
not
her
caesars
fought
and
won
how
reigns
britannia
empress
near
and
far
but
for
her
waterloo
and

and
we
know
not
our
souls
a
quickening
thrill
at

of
lexington
and
bunker

with
a
pride
no
rival
passion

greet
we
not
now
our

yes

i
own
your
theory
is
fine
i
grant
your
outlook
far
exceedeth
mine
in
excellence
and
beauty
in
its
scope
embracing
that
millennial
age
of
bliss
the
spirit
pants
for
while
it
chafes
in
this
i
covet
tho
i
can
not
share
your
hope
my
hope
she
answered
smiling
is
a
faith
the
kingdoms
of
this
world
are
yet
to
be
the
kingdoms
of
our
blessed
lord
the
christ
lord
of
all
life
thro
dire
and
vengeful
death
wrought
thro
such
sacrifice
unspared
unpriced
his
word
and
purpose
must

see
and
realms
by

must
own
allegiance
to
the

i

across
the
opal
beauty
of

at

the

emblem
of

i

as

to

of
peace
on

unto

the

for
the
soft

again
good

fire
consuming

greece
less
nobly
in

parthenon

grievances

we
not

we

need
of

surely
it

be
so

the
sated
earth
cries
out
against
the
flow
of
human
blood
long
how
long
the
cry
must
pierce
the
heavens
from
writhing
hearts
below
but
men
heed
not
the
glamor
and
the
gain
of
warfare
blind
them
to
its
sin
and
pain
they
know
not
pity
and
they
count
not
cost
till
armies
meet
and
life
and

are
lost
would
they
but
listen
an
errand
blest
to
plead
against
oppressor

they
but
follow
it
were
joy
indeed
up
the
white
hills
of

ah
the
multitudes
are
gone
astray
the
powerful
of
the

have
their

what

your

noble
to

to
fan
the

that
souls

heights
of

boys
and
girls
we
were
seven
in
all
as
the
dear
rustic
maid
to
the
poet
so
sweetly
protested
and
together
we
rambled
and
studied
and
played
each
imbibing
a
share
of
the
sunshine
and
shade
wherewith
our
young
life
was
invested
and
black
eyes
and
blue
eyes
and
brown
eyes
and
gray
looked
up
to
the
face
of
our
mother
as
she
led
us
in
study
in
labor
or
play
or
told
of
our
father
and
taught
us
to
pray
and
to
cherish
and
love
one
another
o
the
rapture
of
being
when
life
is
with
the
and
beauty
of
morning
when
the
roseate
dawn
brightens
into
the
noon
and
the
year
hastens
on
to
the
splendor
of
june
in
her
fragrance
and
matchless
adorning
so
our
years
flitted
by
and
the
youngest
of
all
our
and
brother
was
grown
to
be
manly
and
lithesome
and
tall
and
to
couteous
titles
we
answered
the
call
but
were
still
boys
and
girls
to
each
other
o
the
joy
of
endeavor
endurance
and
toil
on
thro
vigor
and
sweetness
of
triumph
that
which
would
hinder
or
foil
of
the
patience
of
hope
after
tears
and
turmoil
in
the
glory
of
autumn
completeness
and
the
toil
and
the
turmoil
and
tears
have
been
ours
from
our
ranks
we
have
missed
a
loved
brother
we
encountered
the
thorns
but
we
cherished
the
flowers
we
passed
under
the
clouds
on
to
sunnier
hours
and
we
still
boys
and
girls
to
each
other
a
smile
the
gliding
of
a
fairy
form
and
rosy
lips
that
knew
no
guile
with
wonder
parted
came
to
ask
papa
what
is
a
smile
a
smile
it
is
then
stole
that
gentle
parent
features
for
to
him
had
been
proposed
query
so
strange
before
but
while
he
pondered
in
his
heart
how
he
should
to
his
child
reply
a
new
triumphant
joy
lit
up
her
loving
lustrous
eye
and
with
this
gladsome
thought
she
answered
in
her
own
behalf
oh
now

know

when

had
no

at

we
have
often
smiled
for
the

oft
our

a
life
work
in
memory
of
daniel
hill
he
heard
the
cry
of
man
enslaved
in
bonds
and
servile
toil
and
gave
his
voice
for
freedom
till
the
freedman
tilled
he
saw
his
weaker
brother
reel
pierced
by
drink
poisoned
dart
and
wrought
and
wrote
with
fervent
zeal
to
stay
the
tempter
art
he
heard
the
clash
of
sword
and
gun
in
deadly
and
pleaded
till
his
day
was
done
for
love
sweet
rule
in
life
he
rests
in
peace
who
now
shall
wear
the
mantle
he
let
fall
who
teach
as
he
the
the
brotherhood
of
all
visions
i
saw
when
israel
toiled
and
groaned
beneath
the
pharoah
rod
and
in
his
hopeless
bondage
moaned
his
helpless
prayer
to
god
i
saw
when
from
the
river
brink
the
infant
leader
rose
who
reared
in
egypt
royal
court
still
felt
his
brothers
woes
i
heard
him
at
the
burning
bush
his
swift
excuses
bring
who
who
am
i
that
i
should
stand
before
the
egyptian
king
and
who
am
i
that
i
should
lead
the
people
of
thy
choice
my
warning
word
they
will
not
heed
nor
hearken
to
my
voice
and
who
am
i
that
i
should
move
a
monarch
to
relent
i
but
a
man
and
slow
of
speech
nor
wise
nor
eloquent
i
marked
the
answer
plead
no
more
thy
vain
excuse
to
me
i
am
the
lord
my
servant
thou
my
glory
thou
shalt
see
i
am
the
lord
the
power
is
mine
is
thine
to
hear
and
do
the
lord
almighty
is
to
save
by
many
or
by
few
the
man
of
doubt
exchanged
his
fears
for
faith
in
god
and
right
while
meek
obedience
on
his
brow
sat
like
a
crown
of
light
the
slow
of
speech
grew
eloquent
till
israel
gladly
heard
and
bolder
waxed
the
leader
till
the
king
hard
heart
was
stirred
and
he
in
fierce
displeasure
drove
the
captives
from
his
land
not
knowing
their
deliverance
was
all
divinely
planned
down
the
long
line
of
years
i
looked
and
saw
at
last
the
blissful
view
from
pisgah
height
the
jordan
safely
passed
and
heard
as
memnon
harp
had
caught
the
sweet
enchanting
strain
and
sent
adown
the
waves
of
time
brave
miriam
glad
refrain
sing
for
the
lord
hath
triumphed
sing
great
wonders
can
he
do
the
lord
is
mighty
and
can
save
by
many
or
by
few
i
saw
again
when
by
jabin
hand
oppressed
a
people
cry
went
up
to
god
for
rescue
and
for
rest
then
up
rose
deborah
judge
and
seer
with
all
her
valiant
band
and
drove
the
oppressor
from
her
gates
his
chariots
from
her
land
and
jael
wife
of
heber
slew
his
captain
with
the
sword
so
woman
hand
achieved
that
day
the
victory
for
the
lord
and
woman
voice
extolled
in
song
the
great
deliverer
name
praise
god
he
hath
avenged
his
own
for
willingly
they
came
the
mountains
melt
before
his
face
the
tribes
their
strength
renew
the
lord
is
mighty
and
doth
save
by
many
or
by
few
i
saw
when
gideon
led
his
band
down
to
the
water
bank
to
prove
and
set
them
in
array
as
man
by
man
they
drank
and
with
the
handful
chosen
thus
went
forth
against
the
foe
and
vanquished
all
the
midian
host
and
laid
their
princes
low
not
with
the
thousands
called
from
far
who
pitched
by
harod
well
nor
yet
the
undismayed
who
stood
when
the
fell
but
now
with
these
three
hundred
men
go
forward
said
the
lord
do
thou
thy
part
let
them
do
theirs
trust
and
obey
my
word
their
torches
flashed
like
dancing
flames
their
trumpets
loudly
blew
strange
warfare
but
the
lord
can
save
by
many
or
by
few
once
more
i
saw
when
israel
quailed
before
philistia
pride
while
great
goliath
day
by
day
jehovah
power
defied
the
weak
and
timid
fled
away
the
valiant
shrank
with
fear
threatened
death
or
dire
defeat
and
life
and
fame
are
dear
even
saul
their
chosen
king
forgot
admiring
israel
boast
that
he
stood
head
and
shoulders
high
above
his
martial
host
and
are
there
none
he
cried
who
dare
to
meet
this
vaunting
foe
and
must
the
banner
of
our
god
trail
in
dishonor
low
then
forth
there
came
a
ruddy
youth
that
banner
i
defend
be
it
not
said
our
god
hath
none
on
whom
he
may
depend
let
no
heart
fail
because
of
this
philistine
boast
the
battle
is
the
lord
and
he
will
vanquish
this
proud
host
then
spake
he
to
the
giant
foe
a
loyal
servant
i
of
israel
god
whose
holy
name
thou
darest
to
defy
in
that
dread
name
i
charge
thee
stand
and
shield
thee
as
thou
may
the
fowls
of
air
the
beasts
of
earth
shall
feast
on
thee
was
but
a
pebble
from
the
brook
sent
by
a
loyal
will
but
sword
and
spear
not
mightier
were
god
purpose
to
fulfil
for
one
may
chase
a
thousand
and
ten
thousand
flee
from
two
the
god
of
right
is
strong
to
save
by
many
or
by
few
years
ages
pass
and
now
i
see
a
land
beloved
and
fair
and
lo
a
cruel
enemy
hath
gained
possession
there
the
riches
of
this
goodly
land
into
his
coffers
pour
insatiate
and
unscrupulous
his
constant
cry
is
more
more

thus
man
is

the

bereft
the

the

the
spoiler
hath
his

no

oppression
hath
surpassed
this

who
like
moses
will
exchange
his
and
fear
for
faith
to
meet
the
encroaching
foe
and
check
his
bold
career
and
who
like
deborah
will
arise
and
lead
a
valiant
band
to
drive
the
tyrant
from

gates
the

from

who
will
like
gideon
and
his
men
the
light
of
truth
dare
throw
on
darkest
evil
and
the
trump
of

victory
blow

who
like
david
will
come
forth
in

alone
and
lay
the

the

be
ye
also
ready
let
us
be
still
before
him
yet
once
more
that
voice
hath
spoken
to
our
startled
souls
which
fell
in
solemn
cadence
on
the
ear
of
the
hushed
listeners
on
mt
olive
hill
at
eventide
at
midnight
or
at
morn
the
son
of
man
shall
come
shall
surely
come
be
ready
for
ye
may
not
know
the
hour
and
if
at
eventide
when
nature
folds
her
hands
and
sinks
into
repose
or
if
at
midnight
hour
of
gloom
thou
come
or
when
the
morning
spreads
her
wings
of
light
oh
make
us
ready
for
the
solemn
call
supply
our
need
of
knowledge
wisdom
grace
dear
lord
that
with
confiding
joy
our
souls
made
pure
of
sin
and
strong
in
faith
may
go
to
meet
thee
at
thy
coming
if
the
sound
of
sweet
follow
to
the
brink
of
death
dark
river
as
they
fainter
grow
then
let
us
hear
thy
still
small
voice
of
love
say
to
us
it
is
i
be
not
afraid
or
if
the
angel
of
the
icy
hand
should
find
us
when
no
human
friend
is
near
and
summon
us
away
then
as
we
lose
our
hold
of
earth
and
fall
away
from
life
o
wilt
thou
grant
our
parting
spirits
may
go
out
in
silence
and
be
found
with
thee
mimosa
a
modest
plant
soft
shades
of
green
in
leaflets
poised
on
slender
stem
and
all
outspread
to
catch
the
glow
of

sun
or
gem
but
lo
what
change
when
but
touch
the
leaflets
fringe
the
charm
of
life
is
gone
mimosa
shrinks
as
conscious
of
some
present
harm
so
would
i
have
my
soul
recoil
from
touch
of
wrong
or
thought
of
sin
so
throw
its
portals
wide
again
to
let
the
dew
and
sunshine

the

thus
while

listened
to
the
mournful

woke

on

aghast
before

eternal
youth
looking
in
thine
eyes
of
azure
looking
on
thy
hair
of
gold
once
i
wished
evangelina
that
there
were
no
growing
old
for
i
thought
of
how
thy
sweet
eyes
would
grow
dim
with
tears
and
care
how
the
years
would
turn
to
silver
all
thy
wealth
of
golden
hair
how
the
lines
of
life
would
gather
the
face
so
placid
now
traces
of
its
toil
and
struggle
touching
lip
and
cheek
and
brow
this
i
thought
and
wished
the
shadows
might
not
lengthen
thy
way
wished
there
were
no
time
but
were
no
evening
of
the
day
now
i
fear
evangelina
that
my
wish
was
half
a
prayer
that
the
listening
father
heard
me
that
thou
liest
an
answer
there
for
thou
liest
in
thy
beauty
eyes
of
blue
and
hair
of
gold
lip
and
cheek
and
brow
of
marble
folded
fingers
still
and
cold
o
my
angel
god
hath
called
thee
where
there
is
no
growing
old
building
time
the
time
of
the
singing
of
birds
is
come
is
the
happiest
time
of
the
year
they
are
saying
let
build
us
our
summer
home
for
the
no
longer
we
fear
the
time
of
the
singing
of
birds
is
come
and
the
time
of
their
building
too
with
a
feather
a
straw
and
a
stray
bit
of
gum
they
will
shew
what
can
do
the
time
of
the
singing
of
birds
is
come
i
was
under
the
trees
and
as
i
translated
the
twitter
and
hum
i
thought
the
words
sounded
like
these
the
young
leaves
are
astir
we
will
make
us
a
nest
snug
and
warm
on
this
bough
we
are
at
it
now
all
secure
from
intruders
and
storm
is
for
home
is
for
love
is
for
heaven
above
and
our
roof
is
the
clear
azure
sky
the
foundations
we
lay
in
this
rough
straw
and
clay
but
we
line
it
with
moss
by
and
by
the
time
of
the
singing
of
birds
is
here
and
if
under
the
bough
orlando
and
may
would
a
domicile
rear
let
them
hear
what
the
birds
tell
them
now
build
for
home
build
for
love
build
for
heaven
above
build
with
music
and
cheer
like
the
birds
and
if
palace
or
cot
built
of
marble
or
what
line
your
nest
with
the
moss
of
kind
words
sunrise
the
incident
here
narrated
occurred
some
years
ago
at
the
media
training
school
for
children
then
in
care
of
dr
kerlin
a
feeble
idiot
boy
he
stood
where
nature
in
her
beauty
grew
and
over
field
and
flowering
wood
her
summer
mantle
lightly
threw
the
scene
had
met
his
eye
before
the
pleasant
path
he
oft
had
trod
and
one
who
sought
in
simple
lore
to
teach
him
things
of
heaven
and
god
had
often
wandered
with
him
there
and
pointed
out
each
lovely
spot
the
sunlit
cloud
the
floweret
fair
but
still
he
comprehended
not
for
all
his
soul
was
void
and
still
and
darkness
held
his
mind
in
thrall
he
recognized
no
sovereign
will
nor
saw
the
hand
of
god
in
all
in
nature
presence
now
alone
he
stood
and
filled
with
silent
awe
beheld
before
the
coming
sun
the
curtained
night
in
haste
withdraw
and
gazing
there
with
vacant
eye
all
motionless
and
mute
he
waits
when
lo
the
chariot
of
the
sky
rolls
through
the
morning
crimson
gates
the
orient
beams
with
beauteous
light
hath
not
his
soul
its
radiance
caught
his
being
grasps
a
new
delight
a
deep
mysterious
change
is
wrought
a
light
is
kindled
in
his
breast
a
at
length
is
riven
and
in
that
hour
of
strange
unrest
a
thought
is
born
of
god
in
heaven
in
haste
he
seeks
his
tutor
side
for
he
who
bore
in
grief
a
part
will
in
this
happy
hour
of
pride
responsive
hail
his
joy
of
heart
the
glowing
cheek
the
flashing
eye
the
parted
lips
voiceless
and
caught
from
that
resplendent
sky
the
marvelous
light
upon
his
brow
while
these
ere
yet
he
speaks
attest
the
rapture
which
that
thought
has
given
he
lifts
his
finger
toward
the
east
and
softly
whispers
in
heaven
o
blessed
hour
and
happy
he
to
whom
thro
patient
love
was
given
to
set
a
fettered
spirit
free
and
wake
a
hope
of
god
in
heaven
neal
dow
written
for
a
memorial
day
service
a
soul
was
stirred
as
one
thro
blinding
tears
rehearsed
a
tale
of
want
and
cruel
wrong
keen
indignation
banished
doubts
and
fears
the
purpose
of
imperial
youth
grew
strong
a
voice
was
heard
alas
that
on
the
side
of
sin
and
mad
oppression
there
is
power
but
we
will
change
all
this
if
god
so
aid
and
maine
new
freedom
dated
from
that
hour
a
life
was
given
fraught
with
noble
deeds
aflame
with
words
of
truth
and
tireless
zeal
and
boldness
for
the
right
that
gave
no
heed
to
threatening
hate
or
sycophant
appeal
but
men
decried
the
fervor
of
that
soul
and
would
have
hushed
the
voice
that
pleaded
still
against
the
oppressors
power
and
such
control
as
brought
gain
all
others
loss
and
and
men
denounced
that
life
and
where
it
came
ofttimes
their
scoffings
tainted
the
sweet
air
as
with
malicious
scorn
they
hailed
a
name
that
calumny
itself
left
clean
and
fair
and
now
that
soul
hath
entered
into
rest
that
voice
is
silent
and
that
peerless
life
hath
crossed
the
threshold
where
the
good
and
blest
enter
and
cease
from
sorrow
toil
and
strife
o
life
and
voice
and
soul
o
princely
one
our
loyal
hearts
send
greeting
to
thee
now
thy
name
has
lighted
near
a
century
gone
brighten
ages
yet
to
come
neal
dow
paradise
will
pay
for
all
last
words
of
samuel
purdie
from
the
charm
of
idle
pleasure
from
ambition
siren
song
from
the
rush
for
earthly
treasure
of
the
busy
careless
throng
in
the
dawn
of
life
fair
morning
he
had
heard
the
master
call
yea
i
come
his
heart
made
answer
paradise
will
pay
for
all
on
through
years
of
toil
and
struggle
walked
he
faithful
to
his
word
blameless
life
and
kind
entreaty
leading
many
to
the
lord
meeting
dangers
bearing
burdens
well
might
stoutest
heart
appal
but
to
every
doubt
replying
paradise
will
pay
for
all
now
at
eve
and
weary
pierced
with
pain
the
pilgrim
lay
watching
still
with
faith
triumphant
for
the
dawn
of
brighter
day
then
upon
his
ear
there
falleth
once
again
the
master
call
come
up
higher
yea
he
answers
paradise
will
pay
for
all
forgiveness
father
in
heaven
i
thank
thee
for
this
hour
this
blessed
hour
wherein
my
contrite
soul
humbled
and
happy
bows
itself
to
thee
pleading
that
all
its
error
and
its
sin
may
be
forgiven
even
as
i
forgive
the
cruel
wrong
swept
me
like
a
flood
and
my
hurt
soul
in
fierce
defiance
rose
and
all
forgetful
that
itself
could
sin
heaped
heavy
hatred
on
the
offender
head
there
came
a
calmer
hour
in
which
i
saw
the
strong
temptation
that
had
moved
him
thus
to
barter
all
his
better
life
away
love
honor
principle
to
gain
the
world
and
seeing
this
i
learned
to
pity
him
for
well
i
knew
the
bauble
he
had
won
would
only
mock
him
with
its
faithless
glare
and
well
i
knew
the
golden
fruit
he
grasped
would
be
but
dust
and
ashes
in
his
hand
and
knowing
this
i
learned
to
pity
him
and
as
my
pity
grew
it
turned
to
prayer
that
when
the
glitter
of
the
gold
was
gone
and
the
sweet
fruit
was
bitter
to
his
taste
when
the
sad
memory
of
the
slighted
past
came
and
made
deeper
still
the
present
gloom
the
darkness
might
be
lifted
and
the
soul
and
famishing
might
find
its
way
to
the
green
pastures
and
the
springs
of
life
that
in
the
heart
whence
love
and
joy
had
fled
whence
hope
was
exiled
there
might
yet
be
peace
but
suddenly
i
queried
in
my
heart
what
power
had
moved
me
that
i
should
have
prayed
for
him
i
counted
as
my
foe
greatly
i
marveled
what
it
meant
that
thus
i
had
called
down
such
blessing
upon
him
the
kindliest
boon
of
heaven
the
peace
of
god
deep
in
my
soul
there
came
an
answering
voice
o
child
is
but
this
thou
hast
then
thanks
o
father
for
this
plessed
hour
wherein
my
soul
by
thine
own
spirit
taught
prays
with
no
mockery
of
words
thy
prayer
forgive
my
trespasses
i

a

in

the

looked

upon

and
cried
how
beautiful
a

to
be
the

herself
was
beautiful
to
see
her
hair
of
glowing
golden
light
uncurled
about
a
face
of
clear
serenity
whereon
smiles
played
daintily
and
free
aye
fair
the
earth
she
said
most
fair
and
yet
how
can
i
for
one
briefest
space
forget
how
dark
a
stain
its
loveliness
doth
mar
a
stain
a
scourge
the
cruel
curse
of
war
even
now
i
dimly
see
and
faintly
hear
the
clang
of
drum
the
clash
of
sword
and
spear
and
pale
with
pity
swift
she
shrank
away
leaving
the
world
and
war
to
broader
day
the
sun
at
noon
looked
down
upon
the
world
from
depths
of
vast
ethereal
blue
looked
down
and
mused
you
far
fair
earth
sure
we
must
crown
queen
of
the
universe
great
flags
unfurled
her
bright
waters
witness
high
renown
won

aye
bring
for

stay
there
riseth
over

a
cloud
of
with
crimson
stains
her
rivers
run
her
hills
and
meadows
fair
trampled
by
hostile
hordes
lie
waste
and
bare
and
yonder
in
the
islands
of
the
sea
a
people
struggle
vainly
to
be
free
and
everywhere
the
banners
of
fair
fame
trail
in
the
dust
of
hatred
greed
and
shame
no
crown
for
earth
i
mourn
so
bright
a
star
lost
in
the
chaos
of
consuming
war
and
veiled
in
robe
of
woe
he
went
his
way
borne
by
the
passing
hours
to
close
of
day
the
twilight
lingered
and
the
evening
star
looked
back
upon
the
world
and
whispered
low
these
who
have
spoken
surely
could
not
know
earth
is
a
great
pure
pearl
and
seems
from
far
set
with
fair
homes
like
gems
in
amber
glow
or
emerald
green
or
gold
or
roseate
snow
but
hush
in
palace
hall
a
bitter
cry
a
mangled
hero
is
borne
in
to
die
and
in
yon
lowly
cot
a
widow
moan
a
mother
her
only
son
alas
is
true
earth
destroy
her
noblest
manhood
rob
her
homes
of
joy
and
sad
the
star
of
evening
sank
from
sight
while
earth
lay
shrouded
in
the
gloom
of
night
but
from
afar
beyond
the
morning
birth
beyond
the
depths
whence
sun
looked
down
on
earth
beyond
the
dreamy
distance
of
the
star
a
voice
proclaimed
they
shall
no
more
learn
war
light
on
my
pathway
blessed
lord
the
light
of
life
i
pray
o
let
the
glory
of
thy
word
shine
my
life
i
cry
to
thee
for
present
help
turn
not
my
prayer
away
o
strength
and
refuge
of
thine
own
keep
thou
my
soul
my
willing
but
uncertain
feet
guide
in
thy
chosen
way
and
let
thy
grace
sufficient
be
for
all
my
need
losing
victories
my
class
one
summer
morn
was
gathered
in
the
maple
shade
near
the
church
door
and
there
we
talked
of
the
fair
world
our
lord
had
made
the
swaying
trees
upon
the
hill
the
waving
grain
the
shadowy
grove
till
every
little
heart
seemed
filled
with
the
sweet
sense
of
jesus
love
a
query
came
dear
little
ones
as
days
go
by
what
shall
we
do
since
jesus
has
so
loved
us
all
to
show
him
that
we
love
him
too
i
mind
mama
said
wilful
tim
and
ben
i
carry
in
the
wood
said
mary
i
will
lessons
learn
while
dimple
lisped
i
will
be
dood
and
how
will
helen
show
her
love
she
with
a
wistful
glance
at
rose
a
sweet
but
pale
and
timid
child
replied
by
giving
up
i
dear
girl
to
fragile
sister
rose
she
oft
must
yield
her
will
and
way
but
now
this
duty
shall
disclose
her
love
for
jesus
day
by
day
oh
oft
were
we
but
wise
we
find
our
triumph
in
another
gain
on
glowing
altar
coals
of
love
would
joy
to
see
slain
in
simplest
ways
the
soul
may
drink
with
christ
the
sacrificial
cup
and
many
a
victory
is
won
and
nobly
won
by
up
not
mine
thy
will
thy
way
not
mine
o
blessed
lord
my
will
would
choose
the
smooth
and
pleasant
way
and
that
might
lead
from
duty
path
astray
nay
i
would
walk
according
to
thy
word
choosing
thy
way
not
mine
thy
peace
my
gracious
saviour
would
i
choose
my
peace
might
lead
me
man
not
god
to
please
might
lure
my
soul
to
take
its
selfish
ease
and
gaining
all
the
world
itself
to
lose
give
me
thy
peace
not
mine
thy
will
thy
way
thy
peace
thou
knowest
best
let
me
but
see
the
guiding
of
thine
eye
let
me
but
know
thy
voice
and
swift
reply
my
soul
shall
make
to
every
know
behest
doing
thy
will
not
mine
in
the
desert
ah
me
what
life
since
hers
in
age
agone
hath
not
known
hagar
hour
in
desert
wild
outcast
from
sheltering
home
adrift
alone
bereft
of
love
sweet
ministry
her
child
her
heart
one
treasure
late
so
fond
and
fair
become
a
burden
more
than
she
could
bear
all
earth
and
sky
a
strange
enfolding
scroll
writ
with
nameless
pain
and
sense
of
need
to
which
nor
pitying
eye
nor
ear
gave
heed
came
the
thought
of
even
so
the
soul
consumed
with
vain
regret
and
doubt
and
dread
as
she
upon
the
barren
sand
her
boy
lays
all
it
once
had
counted
hope
and
joy
upon
the
desolate
waste
itself
had
spread
tho
with
bitter
cry
i
yield
thee
but
i
can
not
see
thee
die
but
passing
thence
the
agonizing
plea
faith
transforms
into
tuneful
harmony
glad
to
remember
thou
god
seest
me
a
phantom
in
the
circle
written
for
a
literary
club
to
which
the
author
had
formerly
belonged
in
waterford
start
not
good
friends
there
was
a
time
when
i
whom
fate
in
kindly
mood
made
brief
sojourner
in
your
clime
was
glad
partaker
of
the
good
that
from
your
circle
emanated
and
as
the
seven
days
went
the
appointed
evening
found
me
with
its
members
congregated
and
also
now
i
recognize
the
smiling
lips
and
beaming
eyes
of
some
who
cordial
kind
and
free
had
smiles
and
loving
words
for
me
who
when
i
entered
rose
to
greet
and
welcome
gave
sincere
and
sweet
but
that
was
years
ago
and
now
there
may
be
wrinkles
on
my
brow
there
may
have
fled
from
form
and
face
the
transient
charms
of
youth
and
grace
and
time
and
sadness
may
have
thrown
a
shadow
the
chestnut
brown
of
locks
that
once
well
let
that
pass
these
are
but
sorrowful
reflections
and
like
those
of
my
do
but
discover
imperfections
so
let
us
leave
this
train
of
thought
and
start
in
happier
directions
but
first
i
think
it
may
be
due
alike
unto
myself
and
you
lest
some
should
think
i
may
have
brought
my
ghostly
presence
here
unsought
to
make
this
note
of
explanation
that
not
for
pride
or
praise
or
gloom
or
curious
motive
am
i
come
nor
yet
for
want
of
occupation
far
from
intruding
thus
i
would
have
it
distinctly
understood
i
here
by
special
invitation
here
and
my
phantom
pulses
quicken
pale
memories
gather
round
me
fast
and
now
they
grow
and
gleam
and
thicken
and
fan
me
with
their
wings
of
light
and
bear
me
to
a
realm
more
bright
than
fairy
land
or
elfin
home
or
that
sweet
world
whence
dreams
do
come
the
heaven
of
a
happy
past
familiar
faces
on
me
smile
remembered
voices
greet
my
ear
and
social
converse
gives
the
while
the
wisdom
and
good
cheer
but
while
we
all
engaged
in
chat
of
work
of
weather
and
all
that
and
voices
rise
and
smiles
grow
broader
presiding
dignity
comes
forth
with
modest
but
amazing
worth
and
calls
the
whole
concern
to
order
then
minutes
penned
by
hand
approved
without
dissension
stand
and
hushed
is
all
the
talk
and
noise
the
while
some
soft
or
manly
voice
from
gifted
author
doth
unfold
before
us
treasures
new
and
old
we
grant
them
rare
yet
lay
them
by
our
intellectual
strength
to
try
in
essay
speech
or
declamation
we
reverence
the
might
of
mind
but
here
our
thoughts
still
find
a
kindlier
appreciation
with
hushed
breath
and
eyes
that
glisten
to
some
fine
argument
we
listen
from
one
with
head
so
full
of
lore
that
to
prevent
its
brimming
he
must
impart
his
information
the
which
he
does
by
book
and
rule
achieving
in
the
village
school
a
reformation
with
rapt
attention
now
we
hear
a
discourse
upon
sound
and
ear
wherein
is
beautifully
blended
the
science
and
the
history
the
knowledge
and
the
mystery
so
fair
when
fairly
comprehended
then
some
poetic
brain
is
fired
some
secret
spring
unlocked
for
a
brother
brings
with
love
inspired
kind
thoughts
in
glowing
words
attired
and
prays
at
once
with
heart
and
pen
and
all
the
people
say
amen
god
bless
the
country
doctor
and
lesser
lights
send
out
a
gleam
of
intellectual
glory
and
many
a
grave
or
playful
theme
or
fact
profound
or
doubtful
dream
or
song
or
allegory
beguiles
the
gloom
of
winter
night
and
makes
the
slow
hours
swift
and
light
to
social
pleasure
adds
a
charm
makes
young
hearts
wise
and
old
hearts
warm
and
life
a
pleasant
story
o
friends
i
live
it
again
i
cross
the
gulf
now
and
then
and
live
that
happy
time
again
its
varied
joy
and
brightness
all
the
crowded
room
the
lighted
hall
the
merry
laugh
the
friendly
nod
and
bless
the
fate
that
brought
but
no
let
us
not
read
these
chances
so
is
the
sovereign
will
of
he
marks
the
paths
by
mortals
trod
and
he
appoints
our
joy
and
woe
then
bless
we
god
whose
gracious
hand
hath
led
us
gently
on
our
way
by
whose
good
will
we
stand
rejoicing
that
we
live
by
whose
sweet
mercy
yet
we
trust
that
all
of
us
which
is
not

from

and

of
earth
shall
rise
to
nobler
life

of

praying
thou
wilt
take
him
in

over

for
giving
such
attention
while
we
arraigned
old
alcohol
and
of
his
faults
made
mention
and
if
you
like
to
see
him
now
put
in
a
pretty
pickle
just
lend
a
hand
and
help
us
on
by
giving
us
a
nickel
he
stalks
the
earth
from
east
to
west
a
deal
of
mischief
doing
but
we
are
on
the
now
old
alcohol
pursuing
so
if
you
like
to
see
him
caught
and
punished
for
his
crime
sir
just
lend
a
hand
and
help
us
on
by
tossing
us
a
dime
sir
he
robs
our
homes
of
peace
and
joy
he
fills
the
land
with
sighing
sets
snares
and
pitfalls
for
our
feet
he
better
be
so
if
you
think
he
should
be
slain
as
we
believe
he
just
lend
a
hand
and
help
us
on
by
handing
out
a
quarter
he
boasts
himself
a
king
by
law
and
license
well
protected
but
now
the
children
are
we
have
him
soon
ejected
so
if
you
see
us
tackle
him
and
take
him
by
the
collar
just
lend
a
hand
and
help
us
on
by
dropping
in
a
dollar
the
ballad
of
the
boundary
line
here
shall
the
boundary
line
be
laid
not
so
but
here
the
other
said
clamor
of
contest
ran
fierce
and
high
defiant
challenge
and
proud
reply
for
heights
of
the
andes
rose
between
the
chilean
states
and
the
argentine
and
the
mooted
question
day
by
day
was
what
doth
limit
my
neighbor
sway
the
sunlight
rose
and
the
shadows
fell
on
either
slope
but
none
could
tell
just
where
the
morning
magic
wand
touched
the
argentine
or
chile
land
fair
in
their
verdure
pure
in
their
snow
so
near
to
heaven
their
summits
go
why
should
they
ever
by
man
be
trod
seem
they
should
only
belong
to
god
but
the
strife
went
on
with
passing
years
fed
by
resentment
and
pride
and
fears
nor
priest
nor
people
could
yet
define
the
rightful
range
of
the
boundary
line
the
strife
went
on
with
its
loss
and
shame
as
generations
went
and
came
and
each
in
its
turn
the
task
essayed
to
solve
the
problem
so
long
delayed
then
kinder
kinglier
thought
prevailed
where
threat
of
sword
and
gun
had
failed
and
reason
wrought
the
adjustment
long
so
vainly
sought
for
how
can
a
trifle
of
earth
and
air
with
the
worth
of
human
lives
compare
and
what
can
it
matter
if
thine
or
mine
be
the
narrow
side
on
the
boundary
line
and
why
should
greed
and
grim
distrust
despoil
us
of
our
faith
and
trust
enough
enough
let
us
pledge
our
word
to
settle
by
judgment
not
by
sword
let
us
heed
the
counsel
our
good
priests
bring
and
raise
the
standard
of
christ
our
king
and
the
here
or
there
of
the
boundary
line
let
god
and
the
british
king
define
then
the
of
the
nation
stirred
as
the
fair
de
costa
plea
was
heard
fathers
and
brothers
warriors
men
shall
we
give
our
bravest
to
death
and
pain
shall
we
hush
our
hearts
as
we
see
them
go
god
pity
to
strive
with
a
brother
foe
long
we
have
waited
have
suffered
and
prayed
for
a
joy
still
denied
us
a
hope
still
delayed
enough
let
the
sun
in
highest
heaven
pencil
the
line
for
which
you
have
striven
let
a
princely
people
on
either
side
in
friendship
and
fair
accord
abide
be
the
strife
of
the
past
to
the
wild
winds
swept
the
faith
of
the
future
unswervingly
kept
and
let
christ
of
the
andes
rest
in
token
of
peace
on
the
mountain
crest
grandly
the
people
made
reply
the
pledge
was
taken
the
arms
laid
by
and
glad
thanksgiving
and
festal
song
witnessed
the
joy
of
the
gathered
throng
joy
for
the
strife
of
the
past
was
joy
for
the
promise
of
war
no
more
joy
in
the
gladness
of
land
and
home
joy
for
the
peace
to
come
on
height
of
the
andean
range
they
planted
the
statue
fair
and
strange
and
there
to
the
query
of
the
sky
its
bronze
and
granite
make
reply
i
witness
the
failure
of
the
sword
the
victory
of
the
word
to
dust
may
crumble
rock
and
hill
this
pledge
of
nations
abideth
still
so
now
the
boundary
line
is
laid
christ
in
the
heart
hath
the
conflict
stayed
and
now
doth
the
christ
of
the
andes
rest
in
token
of
peace
on

margaret

margaret
lee
you
do
not
know
her
rightly
named
a
pearl
is
she
half
a
score
of
years
i
loved
her
precious
margaret
lee
dimples
no
nor
golden
tresses
nor
yet
voice
of
silvery
tone
if
such
phrases
must
express
her
beauty
she
has
none
soft
brown
hair
and
grey
eyes
dreaming
visions
that
none
others
see
plain
her
features
might
call
her
homely
margaret
lee
margaret
owns
no
stately
mansion
carries
not
a
heavy
purse
heiress
to
no
lordly
acres
humble
station
hers
quietly
she
treads
life
highway
quiet
yet
with
noble
mien
the
lowly
the
lofty
journeying
like
a
queen
some
have
called
her
cold
and
haughty
from
her
bearing
high
and
free
some
have
said
a
lofty
spirit
dwells
with
margaret
lee
why
then
do
the
hail
with
joy
her
coming
nigh
why
the
childern
love
her
shadow
as
she
passeth
by
some
have
deemed
her
weak
erratic
some
too
strong
one
avers
her
mood
too
gloomy
one
too
light
her
song
all
may
be
the
clouds
of
error
ofttimes
overshade
her
way
hiding
where
the
rough
and
changeful
paths
of
duty
lay
but
unseen
by
mortal
vision
daily
bends
a
suppliant
knee
humbly
bows
a
contrite
spirit
praying
margaret
lee
asking
of
the
pardon
for
her
erring
life
seeking
wisdom
faith
and
patience
for
its
coming
strife
so
with
footstep
sometimes
faltering
but
with
steadfast
hope
in
god
keeps
she
still
a
blithesome
journey
the
earthly
road
and
at
last
all
loss
and
failure
lost
in
mercy
it
may
be
heaven
gate
of
pearl
will
open
for
sweet
margaret
lee
there
redeemed
from
sin
and
sorrow
there
from
care
and
conflict
free
she
will
walk
the
angel
city
angel
margaret
lee
soaring
upward
lingering
on
the
threshold
of
eternity
looked
lovingly
back
to
tell
of
the
glory
revealed
to
her
purified
vision
angels
are
waiting
she
whispered
and
all
is
beautiful
beautiful
then
as
her
spirit
winged
its
happy
way
a
sweet
murmur
again
was
heard
and
the
words
were
soaring
upward
upward
into
heaven
they
call
thee
dead
they
say
that
thou
art
gone
forevermore
from
earth
it
is
not
so
i
know
thy
gentle
spirit
will
return
and
linger
fondly
round
the
loved
below
they
call
thee
dead
and
now
thou
art
not
ours
god
touched
thee
for
thy
work
on
earth
was
done
thy
presence
was
to
us
like
summer
flowers
and
they
are
faded
now
and
thou
art
gone
i
had
not
thought
fair
girl
that
thou
couldst
die
i
knew
thee
gentle
innocent
and
gay
and
dreamed
not
that
the
brightness
of
thine
eye
was
destined
thus
so
soon
to
fade
away
is
well
he
giveth
his
beloved
sleep
o
sleeper
thou
so
early
loved
and
blest
say
were
it
wrong
if
we
who
linger
weep
and
long
to
sleep
like
thee
and
be
at
rest
ay
we
who
linger
should
not
idlers
be
day
hath
appointed
work
from
morn
till
even
and
while
we
wait
is
sweet
to
think
of
thee
as
soaring
upward
upward
into
heaven
the
end
of
the
road
do
you
wonder
at
my
smiling
do
you
wonder
that
i
faint
not
the
burden
of
my
load
o
the
gloom
and
toil
and
duty
change
to
light
and
praise
and
beauty
while
i
looking
toward
the
end
of
the
road
though
the
way
is
long
and
dreary
and
i
languish
for
a
happier
a
more
serene
abode
as
the
light
of
earth
grows
dimmer
looking
up
i
see
the
glimmer
of
its
glory
at
the
end
of
the
road
though
the
talent
seemeth
meager
and
my
sovereign
lord
doth
gather
ever
where
he
hath
not
strowed
yet
i
would
not
therefore
spurn
it
but
with
usury
return
it
at
his
coming
at
the
end
of
the
road
though
i
now
go
forth
with
weeping
if
i
bear
the
precious
seed
which
the
master
would
have
sowed
i
shall
come
again
with
singing
sheaves
of
plenty
with
me
bringing
to
his
harvest
at
the
end
of
the
road
peace
shall
follow
tribulation
this
the
boon

compassion

mortal
hath
bestowed
