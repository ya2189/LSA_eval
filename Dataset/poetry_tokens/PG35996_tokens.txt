a
new
domain
has
been
won
for
poetry
by
the
war
that
of
the
air
this
is
of
greater
importance
than
the
bare
statement
suggests
dawn
patrol
marks
so
notable
a
departure
in
english
literature
that
it
will
in
after
years
be
eagerly
sought
by
collectors
bewsher
most
considerable
triumph
is
to
have
been
the
first
to
regard
humanity
from
the
detached
standpoint
of
the
sky
the
fable
of
pegasus
is
come
true
mr
bewsher
never
strains
for
effect
the
strongest
impression
his
poems
leave
is
of
a
sincere
and
ingenuous
nature
devoted
to
duty
but
of
keen
sensibilities

sometimes
i
fly
at

above
the

where
underneath
the
restless
waters
flow
silver
and
cold
and
slow
dim
in
the
east
there
burns
a
sun
whose
rosy
gleams
along
the
ripples
run
save
where
the
mist
droops
low
hiding
the
level
loneliness
from
me
and
now
appears
beneath
the
haze
a
little
fleet
of
anchored
ships
which
lie
in
clustered
company
and
seem
as
they
are
yet
fast
bound
by
sleep
although
the
day
has
long
begun
to
peep
with
eye
along
the
still
deserted
ocean
ways
the
fresh
cold
wind
of
dawn
blows
on
my
face
as
in
the
sun
raw
heart
i
swiftly
fly
and
watch
the
seas
glide
by
scarce
human
seem
i
moving
through
the
skies
and
far
removed
from
warlike
enterprise
like
some
great
gull
on
high
whose
white
and
gleaming
wings
beat
on
through
space
then
do
i
feel
with
god
quite
quite
alone
high
in
the
virgin
morn
so
white
and
still
and
free
from
human
ill
my
prayers
transcend
my
feeble
plaints
as
though
i
sang
among
the
happy
saints
with
many
a
holy
thrill
as
though
the
glowing
sun
were
god
bright
throne
my
flight
is
done
i
cross
the
line
of
foam
that
breaks
around
a
town
of
grey
and
red
whose
streets
and
squares
lie
dead
beneath
the
silent
dawn
then
am
i
proud
that
england
peace
to
guard
i
am
allowed
then
bow
my
humble
head
in
thanks
to
him
who
brings
me
safely
home
joy
of
when
heavy
on
my
tired
mind
the
world
and
worldly
things
do
weigh
and
some
sweet
solace
i
would
find
into
the
sky
i
love
to
stray
and
all
alone
to
wander
round
in
lone
seclusion
from
the
ground
ah
then
what
solitude
is
mine
from
grovelling
mankind
aloof
their
road
is
but
a
line
their
busy
house
a
roof
that
little
stain
of
red
and
brown
they
boast
about
it
is
their
town
how
small
their
petty
quarrels
seem
poor
crawling
multitudes
below
which
like
the
ants
in
feverish
stream
from
place
to
place
move
to
and
fro
like
ants
they
work
like
ants
they
fight
assuming
blindly
they
are
right
soon
their
existence
i
forget
in
joy
that
on
these
flashing
wings
i
cleave
the
skies
o
let
them
fret
now
know
i
why
the
skylark
sings
untrammelled
in
the
boundless
air
for
mine
it
is
his
bliss
to
share
now
do
i
mount
a
billowy
cloud
now
do
i
sail
low
a
hill
and
with
a
seagull
skill
endowed
circle
and
wheel
and
drop
at
will
above
the
villages
asleep
above
the
valleys
shadowed
deep
above
the
green
whose
streams
which
intermingled
flow
like
silver
are
seen
upon
the
plain
below
above
the
woods
whose
naked
trees
move
buds
upon
the
breeze
and
far
away
above
the
haze
i
see
white
rise
whose
snow
with
sunlight
is
ablaze
and
shines
against
the
distant
skies
such
thoughts
those
towering
ranges
bring
that
i
float
on
so
do
i
love
to
travel
on
through
lonely
skies
myself
alone
for
then
the
feverish
fret
is
gone
which
on
this
earth
i
oft
have
known
kind
is
the
god
who
lets
me
fly
in
sweet
seclusion
through
the
sky
the
rich
red
blood
doth
stain
the
fair
green
grass
and
daisies
white
in
generous
flood
this
day
for
me
is
darkest
night
o
wreck
of
splintered
wood
and
twisted
wire
what
blind
unmeasured
hatred
you
inspire
because
yours
was
the
power
that
life
to
end
of
him
who
was
my
friend
this
morn
we
lay
upon
the
grass
and
watched
the
languid
hours
pass
a
lark
deep
in
the
sky
blue
sea
sang
ecstasies
to
him
and
me
and
with
the
daisies
did
he
play
as
on
the
waving
grass
we
lay
and
made
a
little
daisy
chain
to
bring
his
childhood
back
again
and
while
he
watched
the
clouds
above
he
drifted
into
thoughts
of
love
he
said
i
know
why
skylarks
sing
because
they
love
and
it
is
spring
and
if
i
had
a
voice
as
they
so
would
i
sing
this
golden
may
because
i
love
and
loved
am
i
and
when
i
wander
through
the
sky
i
wish
i
had
a
skylark
voice
and
with
such
singing
could
rejoice
oh
happy
happy
are
these
days
my
heart
is
full
of
praise
and
thanks
to
god
who
brings
this
bliss
oh
what
a
happiness
is
this
to
lie
upon
the
grass
and
know
in
two
short
days
that
i
shall
go
and
see
my
love
fair
face
again
and
wander
in
some
flowery
lane
forgetting
all
the
world
around
and
only
knowing
i
have
found
a
spring
enchantment
which
is
mine
through
god
sweet
sympathy
divine
may
these
two
days
now
swiftly
pass
he
laughed
upon
the
sunlit
grass
the
days
have
passed
but
passed
alas
how
slow
see
down
the
road
a
sad
procession
go
oh
hear
the
wailing
music
moan
why
why
such
grief
am
i
to
know
dear
god
i
wish
i
were
alone
for
by
the
grave
a
girl
with
streaming
eyes
doth
make
mine
dim
while
high
among
the
sunny
springtime
skies
the
larks
still
hymn
night
around
me
broods
the
dim
mysterious
night
and
still
no
whisper
comes
across
the
plain
asleep
beneath
the
breezes
light
which
scarcely
stir
the
growing
grain
slow
chimes
the
quiet
midnight
hour
in
some
unseen
and
distant
tower
while
round
me
broods
the
vague
mysterious
night
and
cool
and
still
and
i
must
desecrate
this
silent
time
of
drowsy
dreams
on
mighty
wings
towards
the
sky
towards
the
stars
i
have
to
climb
and
the
sleeping
country
fly
and
such
clamour
make
that
all
the
villages
must
wake
so
must
i
desecrate
this
quiet
time
of
soft
and
drowsy
dreams
the
hour
comes
soon
must
i
say
farewell
to
this
fair
earth
then
to
my
little
room
i
go
where
i
perhaps
no
more
shall
dwell
shall
i
return
the
gods
but
know
perchance
again
i
shall
not
sleep
on
that
white
bed
in
silence
deep
for
soon
the
hour
comes
to
say
farewell
to
this
fair
friendly
earth
i
stand
there
long
before
into
the
gloom
i
take
my
way
there
are
the
pictures
of
my
friends
and
all
the
treasures
of
my
room
on
which
my
lamp
soft
radiance
sends
and
long
with
lingering
gaze
i
look
upon
each
much
belovèd
book
i
stand
and
dream
before
into
the
gloom
i
sadly
take
my
way
and
now
i
gain
the
field
whence
i
must
part
upon
my
quest
my
pegasus
of
wood
and
steel
is
ready
straining
at
the
start
the
governor
is
at
the
wheel
and
with
an
roar
across
the
hidden
fields
we
soar
so
with
one
envious
look
from
earth
i
part
upon
my
midnight
quest
beneath
me
lies
the
sleeping
countryside
hazy
and
dim
and
here
and
there
a
little
gleam
like
stars
upon
the
heavens
wide
speaks
of
some
wretch
who
can
not
dream
but
on
his
bed
all
night
must
toss
and
hear
me
as
i
pass
across
in
droning
flight
above
the
countryside
hazy
and
huge
and
dim
and
in
the
great
blue
night
i
ever
rise
towards
the
stars
as
to
the
hostile
lands
i
sail
high
in
the
dark
and
cloudless
skies
whose
gloom
our
gloomy
wings
doth
veil
beneath
a
ribbon
shows
where
through
the
woods
a
river
flows
as
in
the
shadowy
night
i
ever
rise
towards
the
scattered
stars
now
high
above
war
frontiers
do
i
sit
above
the
lines
great
lights
like
flowers
rise
and
fall
on
either
side
red
flashes
spit
hot
death
at
those
poor
souls
which
crawl
on
secret
errands
o
how
grim
must
be
that
midnight
slaughter
dim
and
happy
am
i
that
so
high
i
sit
above
those
cruel
lines
each
man
beneath
me
now
detests
my
race
with
iron
hate
each
tiny
light
i
see
must
shine
upon
some
grim
unfriendly
face
who
curses
england
name
and
mine
and
would
be
glad
if
both
were
gone
but
steadily
must
i
fly
on
though
every
soul
beneath
me
loathes
my
race
with
stern
unceasing
hate
i
see
a
city
all
ablaze
with
jewelled
lamps
i
trace
its
quays
its
roads
its
squares
and
all
its
intermingled
ways
and
as
i
wonder
how
it
dares
to
flaunt
itself
the
city
dies
and
in
an
utter
darkness
lies
for
i
have
terrified
that
town
ablaze
with
twinkling
jewelled
lamps
but
see
the
furnace
with
its
ruddy
breath
which
i
must
wreck
the
searchlights
sweep
across
the
sky
ministers
of
death
i
look
deep
in
their
cold
blue
eye
incessant
shells
with
blinding
light
show
every
wire
clear
and
white
there
is
the
furnace
with
its
ruddy
breath
which
i
must
wreck
it
lies
beneath
my
time
has
come
at
last
to
do
my
work
i
wait
o
will
you
never
stop
your
fearful
shells
that
burst
so
fast
and
then
i
hear
destruction
drop
behind
my
back
as
i
release
such
fearful
death
with
such
great
ease
burst
on
you
shells
my
time
has
come
at
last
to
do
my
deadly
work
then
do
i
turn
and
hurry
swiftly
back
towards
my
home
i
gladly
leave
that
place
behind
no
more
i
hear
the
shrapnel
crack
no
more
my
eyes
the
searchlights
blind
i
cross
the
lines
with
lightening
breast
and
sail
into
the
friendly
west
how
glad
am
i
to
hurry
swiftly
back
towards
my
peaceful
home
i
reach
the
field
and
then
i
softly
land
my
work
is
i
leave
my
hot
and
panting
steed
and
clasp
a
comrade
outstretched
hand
and
with
him
to
my
bedroom
speed
then
over
steaming
beakers
set
the
night
fierce
menace
soon
forget
how
great
a
welcome
waits
me
when
i
land
when
all
my
work
is
but
ere
i
search
shy
sleep
on
my
white
bed
i
greet
the
dawn
and
think
with
heart
weighed
down
with
grief
how
cruel
this
dawn
to
those
whose
dead
lie
shattered
torn
whom
like
a
thief
at
darkest
midnight
i
have
slain
poor
unknown
victims
real
my
pain
what
widows
orphans
sweethearts
see
their
dead
this
cruel
hopeless
dawn
the
long
and
tedious
months
move
slowly
by
and
february
chill
has
fled
away
before
the
gales
of
march
and
now
they
have
died
upon
the
peaceful
april
sky
and
still
i
sadly
wander
still
i
sigh
and
all
the
splendour
of
each
springtime
day
is
dyed
for
me
one
melancholy
grey
and
all
its
beauty
can
but
make
me
cry
for
thou
art
silent
oh
far
distant
friend
and
not
one
word
has
come
to
cheer
my
heart
through
these
sad
months
which
seem
to
have
no
end
so
distant
seems
the
day
which
bade
us
part
oh
speak
dear
angel
spring
has
smiled
and
i
despair
a
child
france
horrors
of
the
day
is
cold
the
wind
is
strong
and
through
the
sky
great
throng
while
swathes
of
snow
lie
on
the
ground
which
i
walk
without
a
sound
but
i
have
vowed
to
fly
though
winds
are
fierce
and
clouds
are
grey
my
aeroplane
is
on
the
field
so
i
must
fly
my
fate
is
sealed
and
no
excuses
can
i
make
within
its
back
my
place
i
take
i
strap
myself
inside
the
seat
and
press
the
rudder
with
my
feet
and
hold
the
wheel
with
nervous
grip
and
gaze
around
my
little
ship
for
on
its
taut
depends
my
life
which
will
be
short
if
it
should
fail
me
in
the
air
swift
then
my
fall
and
short
my
prayer
and
these
my
wings
would
be
my
pyre
so
well
i
scrutinise
each
wire
then
out
across
the
field
i
go
in
shaking
progress
noisy
slow
and
turn
until
the
wind
i
face
then
do
i
look
around
a
space
for
fear
is
at
my
heart
and
nervously
i
fear
to
start
the
field
is
clear
the
skies
are
bare
mine
is
the
freedom
of
the
air
and
yet
i
sit
and
hesitate
although
each
moment
that
i
wait
brings
to
my
soul
a
greater
fear
to
me
the
grass
seems
very
dear
dear
seems
the
hut
where
dreams
have
crept
to
me
each
midnight
as
i
slept
dear
seems
the
river
by
whose
brink
i
oft
have
watched
brown
pebbles
sink
deep
in
the
crumbling
bridge
shade
where
in
the
evening
i
have
strayed
my
restless
hands
hold
fast
the
wheel
once
more
the
i
feel
i
move
the
rudder
with
my
feet
and
settle
firmly
in
the
seat
i
start
and
the
snowy
grass
in
ever
quicker
progress
pass
on
either
side
the
ground
streaks
by
and
soon
above
the
grass
i
fly
i
feel
the
air
beneath
the
wings
at
first
a
greater
ease
it
brings
but
soon
the
stormy
strife
begins
and
if
i
lose
is
death
who
wins
the
winds
a
thousand
devils
hold
who
grasp
my
wings
with
fingers
bold
and
keep
me
ceaselessly
i
seem
to
hear
those
devils
mock
as
i
am
thrown
from
side
to
side
in
unseen
eddies
terrified
as
suddenly
i
start
to
drop
and
when
my
plunging
fall
i
stop
up
am
i
swiftly
thrown
once
more
like
no
great
eagle
do
i
soar
but
like
a
sparrow
i
struggle
on
my
faith
is
lost
my
former
confidence
is
dead
and
whispering
fear
has
come
instead
death
ever
dogs
me
close
behind
my
frightened
soul
no
peace
can
find
i
feel
a
torture
in
each
nerve
as
to
the
right
or
left
i
swerve
and
now
imagination
brings
its
evil
thoughts
i
watch
the
wings
and
wonder
if
those
wings
will
break
the
wires
seem
to
shake
i
see
the
ghastly
headlong
rush
and
picture
how
the
fall
would
crush
my
helpless
body
on
the
ground
with
haggard
eyes
i
turn
around
and
contemplate
the
rocking
tail
my
drawn
and
sweating
cheeks
are
pale
fear
clammy
hands
clutch
at
my
heart
i
try
with
unavailing
art
to
summon
thoughts
of
peaceful
hours
spent
in
some
sunny
field
of
flowers
when
my
eyes
would
look
on
some
old
book
and
not
on
this
accursèd
wheel
and
on
this
box
of
wood
and
steel
in
which
at
with
death
i
play
and
wonder
if
each
breath
i
tensely
draw
will
be
my
last
the
happy
thoughts
are
swiftly
past
my
frightened
brain
forbids
them
stay
dear
london
seems
so
far
away
and
far
away
my
friends
each
second
my
existence
ends
in
my
disordered
mind
whose
pace
i
can
not
check
its
race
like
some
ungoverned
whirring
clock
when
frenziedly
it
runs
amok
i
have
resolved
that
i
will
climb
a
certain
height
how
slow
seems
time
as
on
its
sluggish
pivot
creeps
the
laggard
which
keeps
the
truthful
record
o
how
slow
towards
the
clouds
i
seem
to
go
and
then
ambition
gains
its
mark
at
last
the
little
finger
the
point
has
passed
i
can
descend
again
with
conscience
clear
and
end
this
battle
with
persistent
fear
the
engine
clamour
dies
there
is
no
sound
save
whistling
wires
as
towards
the
ground
i
gently
float
my
agony
is
gone
what
peace
is
mine
as
i
go
gliding
on
calm
after
storm
contentment
after
pain
soft
sleep
to
some
tempestuous
burning
brain
the
soothing
harbour
after
foamy
seas
the
gentle
feeling
of
a
perfect
ease
all
all
are
mine
though
yet
by
gusts
distressed
near
is
the
ground
and
with
the
ground
comes
rest
above
the
trees
i
glide
above
the
grass
above
the
earth
i
pass
i
touch
the
ground
run
swift
along
and
stop
above
the
wheel
my
tired
shoulders
drop
i
leave
my
seat
and
slowly
move
away
cold
is
the
wind
the
clouds
are
grey
i
only
wish
my
room
to
gain
and
in
some
book
forget
my
pain
and
lose
myself
in
fancied
dreams
across
titania
golden
streams
of
when
through
the
heat
of
some
long
afternoon
in
blazing
august
on
the
grass
i
lie
and
watch
the
white
clouds
move
across
the
sky
on
whose
azure
is
faintly
etched
the
moon
that
when
the
evening
deepens
will
be
soon
the
brightest
figure
of
those
hosts
on
high
my
heart
is
discontented
and
i
sigh
for
autumn
and
its
vapours
till
i
swoon
upon
the
vision
of
october
days
in
dreaming
london
when
each
mighty
tree
sheds
daily
more
brown
showers
through
the
haze
which
lends
each
street
romance
and
mystery
when
pallid
silver
sunshine
only
gleams
on
that
grey
lovers
city
of
sweet
dreams
of
grain
carlton
killed
in
an
aeroplane
accident
july
it
was
thy
will
o
god
and
so
he
died
for
seventeen
sweet
years
he
was
a
child
upon
whose
grace
thy
smiled
for
he
was
clean
and
full
of
youthful
pride
and
when
his
years
drew
on
then
thou
denied
that
he
by
man
estate
should
be
defiled
and
so
thou
him
to
thy
presence
mild
to
be
with
thee
for
ever
by
thy
side
nor
is
he
dead
he
lives
in
three
great
spheres
his
soul
is
with
thee
in
thy
home
above
his
influence
with
friends
of
former
years
his
memory
with
those
he
used
to
love
he
is
an
emblem
of
that
trinity
with
whom
he
lives
in
happy
ecstasy
of
grain
in
two
long
full
years
have
passed
since
i
have
smelt
sweet
london
in
this
happy
month
of
may
last
year
relentless
war
bore
me
away
to
imbros
isle
where
six
sad
months
i
dwelt
beneath
a
burning
sun
nor
ever
felt
one
breath
of
gentle
spring
blow
the
bay
between
whose
hills
so
long
i
lay
a
restless
captive
now
has
fortune
dealt
more
kindly
with
me
once
again
i
know
the
drowsy
languor
of
the
afternoons
the
soft
white
clouds
the
whiter
snow
the
evenings
and
the
ivory
moons
my
heart
dear
god
leaps
up
till
it
is
pain
with
thanks
to
thee
that
i
am
here
again
fallen
when
death
has
crossed
my
name
from
out
the
roll
of
dreaming
children
serving
in
this
war
and
with
these
earthly
eyes
i
gaze
no
more
upon
sweet
england
grace
perhaps
my
soul
will
visit
streets
down
which
i
used
to
stroll
at
dusks
when
london
roar
like
ebbing
surf
on
some
atlantic
shore
would
trance
the
ear
then
may
i
hear
no
toll
of
heavy
bells
to
burden
all
the
air
with
tuneless
grief
for
happy
will
i
be
what
place
on
earth
could
ever
be
more
fair
than
god
own
presence
mourn
not
then
for
me
nor
write
i
pray
upon
my
clod
life
to
but
soul
to
of
sheppey
i
stood
one
azure
dusk
in
old
auxerre
before
the
grey
cathedral
towering
height
and
in
the
eastern
darkness
very
fair
i
saw
a
little
star
that
twinkled
bright
how
small
it
looked
beside
the
mighty
pile
whose
stone
was
rosy
with
the
western
glow
a
little
star
i
pondered
for
a
while
and
then
the
solemn
truth
began
to
know
that
tiny
star
was
some
enormous
sphere
the
great
cathedral
was
an
atomy
so
often
when
grey
trouble
looms
so
near
that
god
shines
in
our
minds
but
distantly
if
we
but
thought
our
grief
would
seem
so
small
that
we
would
see
that
god
great
love
was
all
here
slow
decay
with
creeping
finger
peels
the
yellow
plaster
from
the
grimy
walls
like
leprous
lichen
day
by
day
which
falls
and
day
by
day
more
rotting
stone
reveals
here
are
old
mournful
squares
through
which
there
steals
no
cheerful
music
or
the
heedless
calls
of
laughing
children
and
the
smoke
which
crawls
across
the
sky
the
heavy
silence
seals
lean
blackened
trees
stretch
up
their
withered
boughs
behind
the
rusty
railings
in
vain
they
seek
the
summer
sunlight
gold
in
which
their
fathers
used
to
drowse
for
pallid
terraces
lie
far
around
in
gloomy
sadness
ever
growing
old
country
i
love
the
little
daisies
on
the
lawn
which
contemplate
with
wide
and
placid
eyes
the
blue
and
white
enamel
of
the
skies
the
larks
which
sing
their
at
dawn
high
the
earth
and
see
the
new
day
born
all
stained
with
amethyst
and
amber
dyes
i
love
the
shadowy
woodland
hidden
prize
of
fragrant
violets
which
the
dewy
morn
doth
open
gently
underneath
the
trees
to
cast
elusive
perfume
on
each
hour
the
waving
clover
full
of
drowsy
bees
that
take
their
murmurous
way
from
flower
to
flower
who
could
but
think
deep
in
some
glade
how
god
must
love
these
things
that
he
has
made
how
many
of
those
youths
who
consecrate
their
lives
to
art
and
worship
at
her
shrine
and
sacrifice
their
early
hours
and
late
in
serving
her
exacting
whims
divine
have
gathered
in
old
chelsea
shaded
peace
whose
faint
elusive
charm
and
gentle
airs
bring
inspiration
fresh
and
sweet
release
from
trouble
haunting
shapes
and
goblin
cares
o
hamlet
whose
demesne
sleeps
in
the
arms
of
london
quietly
whose
roads
and
squares
serene
from
all
the
stress
of
life
seem
ever
free
o
are
you
more
than
just
a
passing
dream
beside
the
city
slim
and
lovely
stream
died
of
wounds
received
at
the
dardanelles
where
stern
grey
busts
of
gods
and
heroes
old
frown
down
upon
the
corridors
chill
stone
on
which
the
sunbeam
amber
pale
is
thrown
from
windows
one
of
quiet
mould
gazed
long
at
those
white
chronicles
which
told
of
honours
that
the
stately
school
had
known
he
read
the
names
and
wondered
if
his
own
would
ever
grace
the
walls
in
letters
bold
he
knew
not
that
he
for
the
school
would
gain
a
greater
honour
with
a
greater
price
that
no
long
years
of
work
but
bitter
pain
and
his
rich
life
he
was
to
sacrifice
not
in
a
university
grey
peace
but
on
the
hilly
chersonese
manica
dardanelles
fringe
of
now
have
i
left
the
world
and
all
its
tears
and
high
above
the
sunny
fly
alone
in
all
this
vast
and
lonely
sky
this
limpid
space
in
which
the
myriad
spheres
go
thundering
on
whose
song
god
only
hears
high
in
his
heavens
ah
how
small
seem
i
and
yet
i
know
he
hears
my
little
cry
down
there
among
mankind
cruel
jest
and
sneers
and
i
forget
the
grief
which
i
have
known
and
i
forgive
the
mockers
and
their
jest
and
in
this
mightly
solitude
alone
i
taste
the
joys
of
everlasting
rest
which
i
shall
know
when
i
have
passed
away
to
live
in
heaven
day
in
the
colours
how
bright
is
earth
rich
gown
none
but
an
airman
knows
yellow
and
green
and
brown
how
bright
is
earth
rich
gown
i
see
as
i
gaze
down
its
purple
cream
and
rose
how
bright
is
earth
rich
gown
none
but
an
airman
knows
the
sea
sad
is
the
lonely
sea
so
vast
and
smooth
and
grey
it
stretches
far
from
me
sad
is
the
lonely
sea
its
cheerful
colours
flee
before
the
fading
day
sad
is
the
lonely
sea
so
vast
and
smooth
and
grey
disillusion
you
mortals
see
the
sky
i
only
see
the
ground
as
through
the
air
i
fly
you
mortals
see
the
sky
and
yet
with
envy
sigh
because
to
earth
you
bound
you
mortals
see
the
sky
only
see
the
ground
in
the
above
the
clouds
i
sail
above
the
clouds
and
wish
my
mind
above
its
clouds
could
climb
as
well
and
leave
behind
the
world
and
all
its
crowds
and
ever
dwell
in
such
a
calm
and
limpid
solitude
with
a
breath
unkind
or
harsh
or
rude
to
break
the
spell
with
a
thought
to
drive
away
the
golden
splendour
of
the
day
alone
and
lost
beneath
the
tranquil
blue
my
god
with
you
in
an
that
i
were
keats
and
with
a
golden
pen
could
for
all
time
preserve
these
golden
days
in
rich
and
glowing
verse
for
poorer
men
who
felt
their
wonder
but
could
only
gaze
with
silent
joy
upon
sweet
autumn
face
and
not
record
in
any
wise
its
grace
alas
but
i
am
even
dumb
as
they
i
can
not
bid
the
fleeting
hours
stay
nor
chain
one
moment
on
a
page
space
that
i
were
grieg
then
with
a
haunting
air
of
murmurs
soft
and
swelling
grand
refrains
would
i
express
my
love
of
autumn
fair
with
all
its
wealth
of
harvest
and
warm
rains
and
with
fantastic
melodies
inspire
a
memory
of
each
mad
sunset
fire
in
which
the
day
goes
slowly
to
its
death
as
through
the
fragrant
woods
dim
evening
breath
doth
soothe
to
sleep
the
drowsy
songbirds
choir
that
i
were
corot
then
september
gold
would
i
store
up
in
painted
treasuries
that
when
the
world
seemed
grey
i
could
behold
its
blazing
colour
with
sweet
memories
and
each
elusive
colour
would
be
mine
that
decorates
these
afternoons
benign
ah
then
i
could
enshrine
each
fleeting
hue
which
dyes
the
woodland
and
enslave
the
blue
of
sky
and
haze
with
genius
divine
how
sad
these
wishes
when
i
have
no
art
of
poetry
or
music
or
of
brush
with
which
to
calm
the
swelling
of
my
heart
by
capturing
the
misty
country
hush
in
muted
violins
i
can
not
hymn
the
shadowy
silence
of
the
copses
dim
nor
can
i
paint
september
hills
gone
then
the
wonder
which
my
vision
fills
when
all
the
earth
is
bound
by
winter
grim
westgate
on
her
seventeenth
birthday
now
has
rich
time
brought
you
a
gift
of
gold
a
long
sweet
year
which
you
can
shape
at
will
and
deck
with
roses
warm
or
with
the
chill
and
heartless
lilies
god
gives
strength
to
mould
our
days
and
lives
with
fingers
firm
and
bold
and
make
them
noble
straight
and
clean
from
ill
though
few
are
willing
and
their
years
they
fill
with
dross
which
they
regret
when
they
are
old
what
splendid
hours
of
your
life
are
these
when
youth
and
childhood
wander
hand
in
hand
and
give
you
freely
all
which
best
can
please
laughter
and
friends
and
dreams
of
fairyland
mourn
not
the
seasons
past
with
useless
tears
but
greet
the
pleasure
of
the
coming
years
france
is
strange
to
leave
this
world
of
woods
and
hills
this
world
of
little
farms
and
shady
mills
of
fields
and
fair
upon
some
sad
and
shadowy
day
when
all
the
skies
are
overcast
and
grey
and
climb
up
through
the
gloomy
air
and
ever
hurry
higher
still
and
higher
till
underneath
you
lies
a
shire
all
beneath
the
ceiling
pale
of
crawling
clouds
whose
barrier
soon
you
reach
and
through
their
clammy
vapours
swiftly
sail
their
chill
defences
hoping
soon
to
breach
to
see
no
skies
above
no
ground
below
and
in
that
nothingness
toss
to
and
fro
is
no
sweet
moment
will
it
never
cease
climbing
and
diving
thrown
from
side
to
side
all
suddenly
there
comes
a
sense
of
peace
and
a
wondrous
scenery
we
glide
o
what
a
splendour
deep
the
cloudless
blue
whose
sparkling
azure
has
a
gorgeous
hue
on
earth
you
know
not
flaming
bright
the
sun
which
shines
upon
a
landscape
with
all
its
power
of
unsullied
light
deep
in
the
shadowy
valleys
do
we
run
and
then
above
the
towering
summits
soar
and
see
for
miles
yet
more
and
more
great
rolling
white
and
soft
with
shadowy
passes
cool
and
huge
and
dim
where
surely
angels
wander
as
they
hymn
their
happy
songs
which
wing
their
way
aloft
to
him
who
made
the
sun
the
azure
deep
and
all
this
gleaming
land
of
peace
and
sleep
alone
i
wander
this
virgin
land
all
all
for
me
below
the
ploughman
plods
along
his
furrows
and
with
restless
hand
the
sower
hurls
his
seed
among
the
clods
they
can
not
see
the
sun
grey
is
their
sky
see
the
sun
the
heaven
blue
on
high
but
i
am
human
and
must
descend
i
bid
farewell
to
all
this
lovely
scene
and
plunge
deep
in
a
cloud
when
will
it
end
this
hazy
voyage
see
the
chequered
green
the
scattered
farmsteads
and
the
quiet
sea
sunless
and
dim
come
hurrying
up
to
me
