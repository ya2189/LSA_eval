and
ill

and
old
moeonides
the
blind
said
it
three
thousand
years
ago
o
friend
unseen
unborn
unknown
student
of
our
sweet
english
tongue
read
out
my
words
at
night
alone
i
was
a
poet
i
was
young
since
i
can
never
see
your
face
and
never
shake
you
by
the
hand
i
send
my
soul
through
time
and
space
to
greet
you
you
will
understand
riouperoux
high
and
solemn
mountains
guard
riouperoux
small
untidy
village
where
the
river
drives
a
mill
frail
as
wood
anemones
white
and
frail
were
you
and
drooping
a
little
like
the
slender
daffodil
oh
i
will
go
to
france
again
and
tramp
the
valley
through
and
i
will
change
these
gentle
clothes
for
clog
and
corduroy
and
work
with
the
of
black
riouperoux
and
walk
with
you
and
talk
with
you
like
any
other
boy
the
town
without
a
market
there
lies
afar
behind
a
western
hill
the
town
without
a
market
white
and
still
for
six
feet
long
and
not
a
third
as
high
are
those
small
habitations
there
stood
i
waiting
to
hear
the
citizens
beneath
murmur
and
sigh
and
speak
through
tongueless
teeth
when
all
the
world
lay
burning
in
the
sun
i
heard
their
voices
speak
to
me
said
one
bright
lights
i
loved
and
colours
i
who
find
that
death
is
darkness
and
has
struck
me
blind
another
cried
i
used
to
sing
and
play
but
here
the
world
is
silent
day
by
day
and
one
on
earth
i
could
not
see
or
hear
but
with
my
fingers
touched
what
i
was
near
and
knew
things
round
and
soft
and
brass
from
gold
and
dipped
my
hand
in
water
to
feel
cold
and
thought
the
grave
would
cure
me
and
was
glad
when
the
time
came
to
lose
what
joy
i
had
soon
all
the
voices
of
a
hundred
dead
shouted
in
wrath
together
someone
said
i
care
not
but
the
girl
was
sweet
to
kiss
at
evening
in
the
meadows
hard
it
is
another
cried
to
hear
no
hunting
horn
ah
me
the
horse
the
hounds
and
the
great
grey
morn
when
i
rode
out
and
one
sighed
i
did
not
see
my
son
before
i
died
a
boy
said
i
was
strong
and
swift
to
run
now
they
have
tied
my
feet
what
have
i
done
a
man
but
it
was
good
to
arm
and
fight
and
storm
their
cities
in
the
dead
of
night
an
old
man
said
i
read
my
books
all
day
but
death
has
taken
all
my
books
away
and
one
the
popes
and
prophets
did
not
well
to
cheat
poor
dead
men
with
false
hopes
of
hell
better
the
whips
of
fire
that
hiss
and
rend
than
painless
void
proceeding
to
no
end
i
smiled
to
hear
them
restless
i
who
sought
peace
for
i
had
not
loved
i
had
not
fought
and
books
are
vanities
and
manly
strength
a
gathered
flower
god
grant
us
peace
at
length
i
heard
no
more
and
turned
to
leave
their
town
before
the
chill
came
and
the
sun
went
down
then
rose
a
whisper
and
i
seemed
to
know
a
timorous
man
buried
long
years
ago
on
earth
i
used
to
shape
the
thing
that
seems
master
of
all
men
give
me
back
my
dreams
give
me
that
world
that
never
failed
me
then
the
hills
i
made
and
peopled
with
tall
men
the
palace
that
i
built
and
called
my
home
my
cities
which
could
break
the
pride
of
rome
the
three
queens
hidden
in
the
sacred
tree
and
those
white
cloudy
folk
who
sang
to
me
o
death
why
hast
thou
covered
me
so
deep
i
was
thy
sister
child
the
friend
of
sleep
then
said
my
heart
death
takes
and
can
not
give
dark
with
no
dream
is
hateful
let
me
live
the
ballad
of
camden
town
i
walked
with
maisie
long
years
back
the
streets
of
camden
town
i
splendid
in
my
suit
of
black
and
she
divine
in
brown
hers
was
a
proud
and
noble
face
a
secret
heart
and
eyes
like
water
in
a
lonely
place
beneath
unclouded
skies
a
bed
a
chest
a
faded
mat
and
broken
chairs
a
few
were
all
we
had
to
grace
our
flat
in
hazel
avenue
but
i
could
walk
to
hampstead
heath
and
crown
her
head
with
daisies
and
watch
the
streaming
world
beneath
and
men
with
other
maisies
when
i
was
ill
and
she
was
pale
and
empty
stood
our
store
she
left
the
latchkey
on
its
nail
and
saw
me
nevermore
perhaps
she
cast
herself
away
lest
both
of
us
should
drown
perhaps
she
feared
to
die
as
they
who
die
in
camden
town
what
came
of
her
the
bitter
nights
destroy
the
rose
and
lily
and
souls
are
lost
among
the
lights
of
painted
piccadilly
what
came
of
her
the
river
flows
so
deep
and
wide
and
stilly
and
waits
to
catch
the
fallen
rose
and
clasp
the
broken
lily
i
dream
she
dwells
in
london
still
and
breathes
the
evening
air
and
often
walk
to
primrose
hill
and
hope
to
meet
her
there
once
more
together
we
will
live
for
i
will
find
her
yet
i
have
so
little
to
forgive
so
much
i
ca
forget
mignon
knowest
thou
the
land
where
bloom
the
lemon
trees
and
darkly
gleam
the
golden
oranges
a
gentle
wind
blows
down
from
that
blue
sky
calm
stands
the
myrtle
and
the
laurel
high
knowest
thou
the
land
so
far
and
fair
thou
whom
i
love
and
i
will
wander
there
knowest
thou
the
house
with
all
its
rooms
aglow
and
shining
hall
and
columned
portico
the
marble
statues
stand
and
look
at
me
alas
poor
child
what
have
they
done
to
thee
knowest
thou
the
land
so
far
and
fair
my
guardian
thou
and
i
will
wander
there
knowest
thou
the
mountain
with
its
bridge
of
cloud
the
mule
plods
warily
the
white
mists
crowd
coiled
in
their
caves
the
brood
of
dragons
sleep
the
torrent
hurls
the
rock
from
steep
to
steep
knowest
thou
the
land
so
far
and
fair
father
away
our
road
is
over
there
felo
de
se
the
song
of
a
man
who
was
dead
ere
any
had
heard
of
his
song
or
had
seen
this
his
ultimate
song
with
the
lines
of
it
written
in
red
and
the
sound
of
it
steady
and
strong
when
you
hear
it
you
know
i
am
dead
not
because
i
was
weary
of
life
as
pallid
poets
are
my
star
was
a
conquering
star
my
element
strife
i
am
young
i
am
strong
i
am
brave
it
is
therefore
i
go
to
the
grave
now
to
life
and
to
life
desire
and
to
youth
and
the
glory
of
youth
farewell
for
i
go
to
acquire
by
the
one
road
left
me
truth
though
a
great
god
slay
me
with
fire
i
will
shout
till
he
answer
me
why
one
soul
and
a
universe
why
and
for
this
it
is
pleasant
to
die
for
years
and
years
i
have
slumbered
and
slumber
was
heavy
and
sweet
but
the
last
few
moments
are
numbered
like
trampling
feet
that
beat
i
shall
walk
with
the
stars
in
their
courses
and
hear
very
soon
very
soon
the
voice
of
the
forge
of
the
forces
and
ride
on
a
ridge
of
the
moon
and
sing
a
celestial
tune
tenebris
interlucentem
a
linnet
who
had
lost
her
way
sang
on
a
blackened
bough
in
hell
till
all
the
ghosts
remembered
well
the
trees
the
wind
the
golden
day
at
last
they
knew
that
they
had
died
when
they
heard
music
in
that
land
and
someone
there
stole
forth
a
hand
to
draw
a
brother
to
his
side
invitation
to
a
young
but
learned
friend
to
abandon
archaeology
for
the
moment
and
play
once
more
with
his
neglected
muse
in
those
good
days
when
we
were
young
and
wise
you
spake
to
music
you
with
the
thoughtful
eyes
and
god
looked
down
from
heaven
pleased
to
hear
a
young
man
song
arise
so
firm
and
clear
has
fancy
died
the
morning
star
gone
cold
why
are
you
silent
have
we
grown
so
old
must
i
alone
keep
playing
will
not
you
lord
of
the
measures
string
your
lyre
anew
lover
of
greece
is
this
the
richest
store
you
bring
us
withered
leaves
and
dusty
lore
and
broken
vases
widowed
of
their
wine
to
brand
you
pedant
while
you
stand
divine
decorous
words
beseem
the
learned
lip
but
poets
have
the
nicer
scholarship
in
english
glades
they
watch
the
cyprian
glow
and
all
the
maenad
melodies
they
know
they
hear
strange
voices
in
a
london
street
and
track
the
silver
gleam
of
rushing
feet
and
these
are
things
that
come
not
to
the
view
of
slippered
dons
who
read
a
codex
through
o
honeyed
poet
will
you
praise
no
more
the
moonlit
garden
and
the
midnight
shore
brother
have
you
forgotten
how
to
sing
the
story
of
that
weak
and
cautious
king
who
reigned
two
hundred
years
in
trebizond
you
who
would
ever
strive
to
pierce
beyond
love
ecstacy
life
vision
is
it
well
we
should
not
know
the
tales
you
have
to
tell
ballad
of
the
londoner
evening
falls
on
the
smoky
walls
and
the
railings
drip
with
rain
and
i
will
cross
the
old
river
to
see
my
girl
again
the
great
and
tram
love
car
has
many
a
light
of
gold
and
white
and
a
single
dark
red
star
i
know
a
garden
in
a
street
which
no
one
ever
knew
i
know
a
rose
beyond
the
thames
where
flowers
are
pale
and
few
the
first
sonnet
of
bathrolaire
over
the
moonless
land
of
bathrolaire
rises
at
night
when
revelry
begins
a
white
unreal
orb
a
sun
that
spins
a
sun
that
watches
with
a
sullen
stare
that
dance
spasmodic
they
are
dancing
there
whilst
drone
and
cry
and
drone
of
violins
hint
at
the
sweetness
of
forgotten
sins
or
call
the
devotees
of
shame
to
prayer
and
all
the
spaces
of
the
midnight
town
ring
with
appeal
and
sorrowful
abuse
there
some
most
lonely
are
some
try
to
crown
mad
lovers
with
sad
boughs
of
formal
yews
and
titan
women
wandering
up
and
down
lead
on
the
pale
fanatics
of
the
muse
the
second
sonnet
of
bathrolaire
now
the
sweet
dawn
on
brighter
fields
afar
has
walked
among
the
daisies
and
has
breathed
the
glory
of
the
mountain
winds
and
sheathed
the
stubborn
sword
of
night
star
in
bathrolaire
when
day
old
doors
unbar
the
motley
mask
fantastically
wreathed
pass
through
a
strong
portcullis
brazen
teethed
and
enter
glowing
mines
of
cinnabar
stupendous
prisons
shut
them
out
from
day
gratings
and
caves
and
rayless
catacombs
and
the
unrelenting
rack
and
tourniquet
grind
death
in
cells
where
jetting
gaslight
gloams
and
iron
ladders
stretching
far
away
dive
to
the
depths
of
those
eternal
domes
the
masque
of
the
magi
three
kings

come

we
tracked
the

young
bacchus
and
his

came
tumbling
down
and
the
town
their
bursting
trumpets
blew
the
silver
night
was
wildly
bright
and
madly
shone
the
moon
to
hear
a
song
so
clear
and
strong
with
such
a
lovely
tune
from
london
houses
huts
and
flats
came
busmen
snobs

and
ugly
men
in

hats
with
charming
little
girls

a

drenched

as
they
wept
those
shining
tears
only
immortals
know
whose
feet
are
set
among
the
stars
above
the
shifting
snow
and
one
spake
out
into
the
night
before
they
left
for
ever
rejoice
rejoice
and
his
great
voice
rolled
like
a
splendid
river
he
spake
in
greek
which
britons
speak
seldom
and
circumspectly
but
judd
that
man
of
mud
translated
it
correctly
and
when
they
heard
that
happy
word
policemen
leapt
and
ambled
the
busmen
pranced
the
maidens
danced
the
men
in
bowlers
gambolled
a
wistful
echo

behind
to
join
the
mortal
dances
but
mr
judd
with
words
unkind
rejected
her
advances
and
passing
down
through
london
town
she
stopped
for
all
was
lonely
attracted
by
a
big
brass
plate
inscribed
for
members
only
and
so
she
went
to
parliament
but
those
ungainly
men
woke
up
from
sleep

turned
about
and
fell
asleep
again

to
thee
be
praise

that
one
day
beneath

when
it
shoots
forth
to
grace
thy
royal
brow

soul

sit
that
cries
upon
thee
now
the
translator
and
the
children
while
i
translated
baudelaire
children
were
playing
out
in
the
air
turning
to
watch
i
saw
the
light
that
made
their
clothes
and
faces
bright
i
heard
the
tune
they
meant
to
sing
as
they
kept
dancing
in
a
ring
but
i
could
not
forget
my
book
and
thought
of
men
whose
faces
shook
when
babies
passed
them
with
a
look
they
are
as
terrible
as
death
those
children
in
the
road
beneath
their
witless
chatter
is
more
dread
than
voices
in
a
madman
head
their
dance
more
awful
and
inspired
because
their
feet
are
never
tired
than
silent
revel
with
soft
sound
of
pipes
on
consecrated
ground
when
all
the
ghosts
go
round
and
round
opportunity
from
machiavelli
but
who
art
thou
with
curious
beauty
graced
o
woman
stamped
with
some
bright
heavenly
seal
why
go
thy
feet
on
wings
and
in
such
haste
i
am
that
maid
whose
secret
few
may
steal
called
opportunity
i
hasten
by
because
my
feet
are
treading
on
a
wheel
being
more
swift
to
run
than
birds
to
fly
and
rightly
on
my
feet
my
wings
i
wear
to
blind
the
sight
of
those
who
track
and
spy
rightly
in
front
i
hold
my
scattered
hair
to
veil
my
face
and
down
my
breast
to
fall
lest
men
should
know
my
name
when
i
am
there
and
leave
behind
my
back
no
wisp
at
all
for
eager
folk
to
clutch
what
time
i
glide
so
near
and
turn
and
pass
beyond
recall
tell
me
who
is
that
figure
at
thy
side
penitence
mark
this
well
that
by
decree
who
lets
me
go
must
keep
her
for
his
bride
and
thou
hast
spent
much
time
in
talk
with
me
busied
with
thoughts
and
fancies
vainly
grand
nor
hast
remarked
o
fool
neither
dost
see
how
lightly
i
have
fled
beneath
thy
hand
destroyer
of
ships
men
cities
helen
of
troy
has
sprung
from
hell
to
claim
her
ancient
throne
so
we
have
bidden
friends
farewell
to
follow
her
alone
the
lady
of
the
laurelled
brow
the
queen
of
pride
and
power
looks
rather
like
a
phantom
now
and
rather
like
a
flower
deep
in
her
eyes
the
lamp
of
night
burns
with
a
secret
flame
where
shadows
pass
that
have
no
sight
and
ghosts
that
have
no
name
for
mute
is
battle
brazen
horn
that
rang
for
priest
and
king
and
she
who
drank
of
that
brave
morn
is
pale
with
evening
an
hour
there
is
when
bright
words
flow
a
little
hour
for
sleep
an
hour
between
when
lights
are
low
and
then
she
seems
to
weep
but
no
less
lovely
than
of
old
she
shines
and
almost
hears
the
horns
that
blew
in
days
of
gold
the
shouting
charioteers
and
still
she
breaks
the
hearts
of
men
their
hearts
and
all
their
pride
doomed
to
be
cruel
once
again
and
live
dissatisfied
war
song
of
the
saracens
we
are
they
who
come
faster
than
fate
we
are
they
who
ride
early
or
late
we
storm
at
your
ivory
gate
pale
kings
of
the
sunset
beware
not
on
silk
nor
in
samet
we
lie
not
in
curtained
solemnity
die
among
women
who
chatter
and
cry
and
children
who
mumble
a
prayer
but
we
sleep
by
the
ropes
of
the
camp
and
we
rise
with
a
shout
and
we
tramp
with
the
sun
or
the
moon
for
a
lamp
and
the
spray
of
the
wind
in
our
hair
from
the
lands
where
the
elephants
are
to
the
forts
of
merou
and
balghar
our
steel
we
have
brought
and
our
star
to
shine
on
the
ruins
of
rum
we
have
marched
from
the
indus
to
spain
and
by
god
we
will
go
there
again
we
have
stood
on
the
shore
of
the
plain
where
the
waters
of
destiny
boom
a
mart
of
destruction
we
made
at
jalula
where
men
were
afraid
for
death
was
a
difficult
trade
and
the
sword
was
a
broker
of
doom
and
the
spear
was
a
desert
physician
who
cured
not
a
few
of
ambition
and
drave
not
a
few
to
perdition
with
medicine
bitter
and
strong
and
the
shield
was
a
grief
to
the
fool
and
as
bright
as
a
desolate
pool
and
as
straight
as
the
rock
of
stamboul
when
their
cavalry
thundered
along
for
the
coward
was
drowned
with
the
brave
when
our
battle
sheered
up
like
a
wave
and
the
dead
to
the
desert
we
gave
and
the
glory
to
god
in
our
song
joseph
and
mary
joseph
mary
art
thou
the
little
maid
who
plucked
me
flowers
in
spring
i
know
thee
not
i
feel
afraid
strange
this
evening
a
sweet
and
rustic
girl
i
won
what
time
the
woods
were
green
no
woman
with
deep
eyes
that
shone
and
the
pale
brows
of
a
queen
mary
inattentive
to
his
words
a
stranger
came
with
feet
of
flame
and
told
me
this
strange
thing
for
all
i
was
a
village
maid
my
son
should
be
a
king
joseph
a
king
dear
wife
who
ever
knew
of
kings
in
stables
born
mary
do
you
hear
in
the
dark
and
starlit
blue
the
clarion
and
the
horn
joseph
mary
alas
lest
grief
and
joy
have
sent
thy
wits
astray
but
let
me
look
on
this
my
boy
and
take
the
wraps
away
mary
behold
the
lad
joseph
i
dare
not
gaze
light
streams
from
every
limb
mary
the
winter
sun
has
stored
his
rays
and
passed
the
fire
to
him
look
eastward
look
i
hear
a
sound
o
joseph
what
do
you
see
joseph
the
snow
lies
quiet
on
the
ground
and
glistens
on
the
tree
the
sky
is
bright
with
a
star
great
light
and
clearly
i
behold
three
kings
descending
yonder
hill
whose
crowns
are
crowns
of
gold
o
mary
what
do
you
hear
and
see
with
your
brow
toward
the
west
mary
the
snow
lies
glistening
on
the
tree
and
silent
on
earth
breast
and
strong
and
tall
with
lifted
eyes
seven
shepherds
walk
this
way
and
angels
breaking
from
the
skies
dance
and
sing
hymns
and
pray
joseph
i
wonder
much
at
these
bright
kings
the
shepherds
i
despise
mary
you
know
not
what
a
shepherd
sings
nor
see
his
shining
eyes
no
coward
song
i
am
afraid
to
think
about
my
death
when
it
shall
be
and
whether
in
great
pain
i
shall
rise
up
and
fight
the
air
for
breath
or
calmly
wait
the
bursting
of
my
brain
i
am
no
coward
who
could
seek
in
fear
a
folklore
solace
or
sweet
indian
tales
i
know
dead
men
are
deaf
and
can
not
hear
the
singing
of
a
thousand
nightingales
i
know
dead
men
are
blind
and
can
not
see
the
friend
that
shuts
in
horror
their
big
eyes
and
they
are
witless
o
i
rather
be
a
living
mouse
than
dead
as
a
man
dies
a
western
voyage
my
friend
the
sun
like
all
my
friends
inconstant
lovely
far
away
is
out
and
bright
and
condescends
to
glory
in
our
holiday
a
furious
march
with
him
i
go
and
race
him
in
the
western
train
and
wake
the
hills
of
long
ago
and
swim
the
devon
sea
again
i
have
done
foolishly
to
head
the
footway
of
the
false
moonbeams
to
light
my
lamp
and
call
the
dead
and
read
their
long
black
printed
dreams
i
have
done
foolishly
to
dwell
with
fear
upon
her
desert
isle
to
take
my
shadowgraph
to
hell
and
then
to
hope
the
shades
would
smile
and
since
the
light
must
fail
me
soon
but
faster
faster
western
train
proud
meadows
of
the
afternoon
i
have
remembered
you
again
and
i
go
seek
through
moor
and
dale
a
flower
that
wastrel
winds
caress
the
bud
is
red
and
the
leaves
pale
the
name
of
it
forgetfulness
then
like
the
old
and
happy
hills
with
frozen
veins
and
fires
outrun
i
wait
the
day
when
darkness
kills
my
brother
and
good
friend
the
sun
fountains
soft
is
the
collied
night
and
cool
the
wind
about
the
garden
pool
here
will
i
dip
my
burning
hand
and
move
an
inch
of
drowsy
sand
and
pray
the
dark
reflected
skies
to
fasten
with
their
seal
mine
eyes
a
million
million
leagues
away
among
the
stars
the
goldfish

and
high
above
the
shadowed

float
the
nenuphars
the
welsh

far
out
across
carnarvon
bay
beneath
the

the
ancient
dead
begin
their
day
and
stream
among
the
graves
listen
for
they
of
ghostly
speech
who
died
when
christ
was
born
may
dance
upon
the
golden
beach
that
once
was
golden
corn
and
you
may
learn
of
dyfed

and
dream
nemedian
tales
of
kings
who
sailed
in
ships
from
spain
and
lent
their
swords
to
wales
listen
for
like
a
golden
snake
the

twists
and
stirs
and
whispers
how
the
dead

oxford
canal
when
you
have
wearied
of
the
valiant
spires
of
this
county
town
of
its
wide
white
streets
and
glistening
museums
and
black
monastic
walls
of
its
red
motors
and
lumbering
trains
and
people
i
will
take
you
walking
with
me
to
a
place
you
have
not
seen
half
town
and
half
country
the
land
of
the
canal
it
is
dearer
to
me
than
the
antique
town
i
love
it
more
than
the
rounded
hills
straightest
sublimest
of
rivers
is
the
long
canal
i
have
observed
great
storms
and
trembled
i
have
wept
for
fear
of
the
dark
but
nothing
makes
me
so
afraid
as
the
clear
water
of
this
idle
canal
on
a
summer
s
noon
do
you
see
the
great
telegraph
poles
down
in
the
water
how
every
wire
is
distinct
if
a
body
fell
into
the
canal
it
would
rest
entangled
in
those
wires
for
ever
between
earth
and
air
for
the
water
is
as
deep
as
the
stars
are
high
one
day
i
was
thinking
how
if
a
man
fell
from
that
lofty
pole
he
would
rush
through
the
water
toward
me
till
his
image
was
scattered
by
his
splash
when
suddenly
a
train
rushed
by
the
brazen
dome
of
the
engine
flashed
the
long
white
carriages
roared
the
sun
veiled
himself
for
a
moment
and
the
signals
loomed
in
fog
a
savage
woman
screamed
at
me
from
a
barge
little
children
began
to
cry
the
untidy
landscape
rose
to
life
a
sawmill
started
a
cart
rattled
down
to
the
wharf
and
workmen
clanged
over
the
iron
footbridge
a
beautiful
old
man
nodded
from
the
first
story
window
of
a
square
red
house
and
a
pretty
girl
came
out
to
hang
up
clothes
in
a
small
delightful
garden
o
strange
motion
in
the
suburb
of

breath
still
drawn
among

fierce
and
fearless
lads
who
played
so
merrily
and
sang
as
sweet
in
the
dawn
as

singing
in

on
some
tower

rejoice
to
go
and
sit
where
all

are
in
the
sun
the
ballad
of
the
student
in
the
south
it
was
no
sooner
than
this
morn
that
first
i
found
you
there
deep
in
a
field
of
southern
corn
as
golden
as
your
hair
i
had
read
books
you
had
not
read
yet
i
was
put
to
shame
to
hear
the
simple
words
you
said
and
see
your
eyes
aflame
shall
i
forget
when
prying
dawn
sends
me
about
my
way
the
careless
stars
the
quiet
lawn
and
you
with
whom
i
lay
your
is
the
beauty
of
the
moon
the
wisdom
of
the
sea
since
first
you
tasted
sweet
and
soon
of
god
forbidden
tree
darling
a
scholar
fancies
sink
so
faint
beneath
your
song
and
you
are
right
why
should
we
think
we
who
are
young
and
strong
for
we
are
simple
you
and
i
we
do
what
others
do
linger
and
toil
and
laugh
and
die
and
love
the
whole
night
through
the
queen
song
had
i
the
power
to
midas
given
of
old
to
touch
a
flower
and
leave
the
petals
gold
i
then
might
touch
thy
face
delightful
boy
and
leave
a
metal
grace
a
graven
joy
thus
would
i
slay
ah
desperate
device
the
vital
day
that
trembles
in
thine
eyes
and
let
the
red
lips
close
which
sang
so
well
and
drive
away
the
rose
to
leave
a
shell
then
i
myself
rising
austere
and
dumb
on
the
hight
shelf
of
my
room
would
place
the
shining
bust
and
wait
alone
until
i
was
but
dust
buried
unknown
thus
in
my
love
for
nations
yet
unborn
i
would
remove
from
our
two
lives
the
morn
and
muse
on
loveliness
in
mine
armchair
content
should
time
confess
how
sweet
you
were
lord
arnaldos
quien
hubiese
tal
ventura
the
strangest
of
adventures
that
happen
by
the
sea
befell
to
lord
arnaldos
on
the
evening
of
john
for
he
was
out
a
hunting
a
huntsman
bold
was
he
when
he
beheld
a
little
ship
and
close
to
land
was
she
her
cords
were
all
of
silver
her
sails
of
cramasy
and
he
who
sailed
the
little
ship
was
singing
at
the
helm
the
waves
stood
still
to
hear
him
the
wind
was
soft
and
low
the
fish
who
dwell
in
darkness
ascended
through
the
sea
and
all
the
birds
in
heaven
flew
down
to
his
then
spake
the
lord
arnaldos
well
shall
you
hear
his
words
tell
me
for
god
sake
sailor
what
song
may
that
song
be
the
sailor
spake
in
answer
and
answer
thus
made
he
i
only
tell
my
song
to
those
who
sail
away
with
me
we
that
were
friends
we
that
were
friends
have
found
a
sudden
fear
a
secret
flame
i
am
on
fire
with
that
soft
sound
you
make
in
uttering
my
name
forgive
a
young
and
boastful
man
whom
dreams
delight
and
passions
please
and
love
me
as
great
women
can
who
have
no
children
at
their
knees
my
friend
i
had
a
friend
who
battled
for
the
truth
with
stubborn
heart
and
obstinate
despair
till
all
his
beauty
left
him
and
his
youth
and
there
were
few
to
love
him
anywhere
then
would
he
wander
out
among
the
graves
and
think
of
dead
men
lying
in
a
row
or
standing
on
a
cliff
observe
the
waves
and
hear
the
wistful
sound
of
winds
below
and
yet
they
told
him
nothing
so
he
sought
the
twittering
forest
at
the
break
of
day
or
on
fantastic
mountains
shaped
a
thought
as
lofty
and
impenitent
as
they
and
next
he
went
in
wonder
through
a
town
slowly
by
day
and
hurriedly
by
night
and
watched
men
walking
up
the
street
and
down
with
timorous
and
terrible
delight
weary
he
drew
man
wisdom
from
a
book
and
pondered
on
the
high
words
spoken
of
old
pacing
a
lamplit
room
but
soon
forsook
the
golden
sentences
that
left
him
cold
after
a
woman
found
him
and
his
head
lay
on
her
breast
till
he
forgot
his
pain
in
gentle
kisses
on
a
midnight
bed
and
welcomed
joy
again
when
love
became
a
loathing
as
it
must
he
knew
not
where
to
turn
and
he
was
wise
being
now
old
to
sink
among
the
dust
and
rest
his
rebel
heart
and
close
his
eyes
ideal
when
all
my
gentle
friends
had
gone
i
wandered
in
the
night
alone
beneath
the
green
electric
glare
i
saw
men
pass
with
hearts
of
stone
yet
still
i
heard
them
everywhere
those
golden
voices
of
the
air
friend
we
will
go
to
hell
with
thee
thy
griefs
thy
glories
we
will
share
and
rule
the
earth
and
bind
the
sea
and
set
ten
thousand
devils
free
what
dost
thou
stranger
at
my
side
thou
gaunt
old
man
accosting
me
away
this
is
my
night
of
pride
on
lunar
seas
my
boat
will
glide
and
i
shall
know
the
secret
things
the
old
man
answered
woe
betide
said
i
the
world
was
made
for
kings
to
him
who
works
and
working
sings
come
joy
and
majesty
and
power
and
steadfast
love
with
royal
wings
o
watch
these
fools
that
blink
and
cower
said
that
wise
man
and
every
hour
a
score
is
born
a
dozen
dies
said
i
in
london
fades
the
flower
but
far
away
the
bright
blue
skies
shall
watch
my
solemn
walls
arise
and
all
the
glory
all
the
grace
of
earth
shall
gather
there
and
eyes
will
shine
like
stars
in
that
new
place
said
he
indeed
of
ancient
race
thou
comest
with
thy
hollow
scheme
but
sail
o
architect
of
dream
to
lands
beyond
the
ocean
stream
where
are
the
islands
of
the
blest
and
where
atlantis
where
theleme
mary
magdalen
o
eyes
that
strip
the
souls
of
men
there
came
to
me
the
magdalen
her
blue
robe
with
a
cord
was
bound
her
hair
with
lenten
lilies
crowned
arise
she
said
god
calls
for
thee
turned
to
new
paths
thy
feet
must
be
leave
the
fever
and
the
feast
leave
the
friend
thou
lovest
best
for
thou
must
walk
in
barefoot
ways
to
give
my
dear
lord
jesus
praise
then
answered
i
sweet
magdalen
god
servant
once
beloved
of
men
why
didst
thou
change
old
ways
for
new
thy
trailing
red
for
corded
blue
roses
for
lilies
on
thy
brow
rich
splendour
for
a
barren
vow
gentle
of
speech
she
answered
me
sir
i
was
sick
with
revelry
true
i
have
scarred
the
night
with
sin
a
pale
and
tawdry
heroine
but
once
i
heard
a
voice
that
said
lives
in
sin
is
surely
dead
but
whoso
turns
to
follow
me
hath
joy
and
immortality
o
mary
not
for
this
i
cried
didst
thou
renounce
thy
scented
pride
not
for
a
taste
of
endless
years
or
barren
joy
apart
from
tears
didst
thou
desert
the
courts
of
men
tell
me
thy
truth
sweet
magdalen
she
trembled
and
her
eyes
grew
dim
for
love
of
him
for
love
of
him
i
rose
from
dreamless
hours
i
rose
from
dreamless
hours
and
sought
the
morn
that
beat
upon
my
window
from
the
sill
i
watched
sweet
lands
where
autumn
light
newborn
swayed
through
the
trees
and
lingered
on
the
hill
if
things
so
lovely
are
why
labour
still
to
dream
of
something
more
than
this
i
see
do
i
remember
tales
of
galilee
i
who
have
slain
my
faith
and
freed
my
will
let
me
forget
dead
faith
dead
mystery
dead
thoughts
of
things
i
can
not
comprehend
enough
the
light
mysterious
in
the
tree
enough
the
friendship
of
my
chosen
friend
prayer
let
me
not
know
how
sins
and
sorrows
glide
along
the
sombre
city
of
our
rage
or
why
the
sons
of
men
are
let
me
not
know
except
from
printed
page
the
pain
of
litter
love
of
baffled
pride
or
sickness
shadowing
with
a
long
presage
let
me
not
know
since
happy
some
have
died
quickly
in
youth
or
quietly
in
age
how
faint
how
loud
the
bravest
hearts
have
cried
a
miracle
of
bethlehem
scene
a
street
of
that
village
three
men
with
ropes
accosted
by
a
stranger
the
stranger
i
pray
you
tell
me
where
you
go
with
heads
averted
from
the
skies
and
long
ropes
trailing
in
the
snow
and
resolution
in
your
eyes
the
first
man
i
am
a
lover
sick
of
love
for
scorn
rewards
my
constancy
and
now
i
hate
the
stars
above
because
my
dear
will
naught
of
me
the
second
man
i
am
a
beggar
man
and
play
songs
with
a
splendid
swing
in
them
but
i
have
seen
no
food
they
want
no
song
in
bethlehem
the
third
man
i
am
an
old
man
sir
and
blind
a
child
of
darkness
since
my
birth
i
can
not
even
call
to
mind
the
beauty
of
the
scheme
of
earth
therefore
i
sought
to
understand
a
secret
hid
from
mortal
eyes
so
in
a
far
and
fragrant
land
i
talked
with
men
accounted
wise
and
i
implored
the
indian
priest
for
wisdom
from
his
holy
snake
yet
am
no
wiser
in
the
least
and
have
not
seen
the
darkness
break
stranger
and
whither
go
ye
now
unhappy
three
the
three
men
with
ropes
sir
in
our
strange
and
special
misery
we
met
this
night
and
swore
in
bitter
pride
to
sing
one
song
together
friend
with
friend
and
then
proceeding
to
the
country
side
to
bind
this
cordage
to
a
barren
tree
and
face
to
face
to
give
our
lives
an
end
and
only
thus
shall
we
be
satisfied
they
make
to
continue
their
road
the
stranger
stay
for
a
moment
great
is
your
despair
but
god
is
kind
what
voice
from
over
there
a
woman
from
a
lattice
my
lover
o
my
lover
come
to
me
first
man
god
with
you
he
runs
to
the
window
stranger
ah
how
swiftly
gone
is
he
many
voices
heard
singing
in
a
cottage
there
is
a
softness
in
the
night
a
wonder
in
that
splendid
star
that
fills
us
with
delight
poor
foolish
working
people
that
we
are
and
only
fit
to
keep
a
little
garden
or
a
dozen
sheep
old
broken
women
at
the
fire
have
many
ancient
tales
they
sing
how
the
whole
world
desire
should
blossom
here
and
how
a
child
should
bring
new
glory
to
his
race
though
born
in
so
contemptible
a
place
let
all
come
in
if
any
brother
go
in
shame
or
hunger
cold
or
fear
through
all
this
waste
of
snow
to
night
the
star
the
rose
the
song
are
near
and
still
inside
the
door
is
full
provision
for
another
score
the
beggar
runs
to
them
the
stranger
to
the
blind
man
do
you
not
mean
to
share
these
joys
the
blind
man
aweary
of
this
earthly
noise
i
pace
my
silent
way
come
you
and
help
me
tie
this
rope
i
would
not
lose
my
only
hope
already
clear
the
birds
i
hear
already
breaks
the
day
stranger
o
foolish
and
most
blind
old
man
where
are
those
other
two
the
blind
man
why
one
is
wed
and
fed
small
thanks
they
gave
to
you
stranger
to
me
no
thanks
are
due
yet
since
i
have
some
little
power
bequeathed
me
at
this
holy
hour
i
tell
you
friend
that
god
shall
grant
this
night
to
you
your
dearest
want
the
blind
man
why
this
sweet
odour
why
this
flame
i
am
afraid
what
is
your
name
the
stranger
ask
your
desire
for
this
great
night
is
passing
the
blind
man
sir
i
ask
my
sight
the
stranger
to
see
this
earth
or
would
you
see
that
hidden
world
which
sent
you
me
the
blind
man
o
sweet
it
were
but
once
before
i
die
to
track
the
bird
about
the
windy
sky
or
watch
the
soft
and
changing
grace
imprinted
on
a
human
face
yet
grant
me
that
which
most
i
struggled
for
since
i
am
old
and
snow
is
on
the
ground
on
earth
there
little
to
be
found
and
i
would
bear
with
earth
no
more
o
gentle
youth
a
fool
am
i
but
let
me
see
the
truth
the
stranger
gaze
in
my
eyes
the
blind
man
how
can
i
gaze
what
song
is
that
and
what
these
rays
of
splendour
and
this
rush
of
wings
the
stranger
these
are
the
new
celestial
things
the
blind
man
round
the
body
of
a
child
a
great
dark
flame
runs
wild
what
may
this
be
the
stranger
look
further
you
shall
see
the
blind
man
out
on
the
sea
of
time
and
far
away
the
empires
sail
like
ships
and
many
years
scatter
before
them
in
a
mist
of
spray
beyond
is
mist
when
the
mist
clears
enough
away
o
friend
i
would
be
there
stranger
it
is
most
sure
that
god
has
heard
his
prayer
the
stranger
vanishes
the
beggar
leading
a
troop
of
revellers
from
the
house
where
they
were
singing
come
brothers
seek
my
friend
and
bring
him
in
on
such
a
night
as
this
it
were
a
sin
to
leave
the
blind
alone
the
revellers
greatly
we
fear
lest
he
still
resolute
have
wandered
to
the
fields
for
poisoned
fruit
the
beggar
see
here
upon
this
stone
he
is
all
frozen
take
him
to
a
bed
and
warm
his
hands
the
revellers
o
sorrow
he
is
dead
gravis
dulcis
immutabilis
come
let
me
kiss
your
wistful
face
where
sorrow
curves
her
bow
of
pain
and
live
sweet
days
and
bitter
days
with
you
or
wanting
you
again
i
dread
your
perishable
gold
come
near
me
now
the
years
are
few
alas
when
you
and
i
are
old
i
shall
not
want
to
look
at
you
and
yet
come
in
i
shall
not
dare
to
gaze
upon
your
countenance
but
i
shall
huddle
in
my
chair
turn
to
the
fire
my
fireless
glance
and
listen
while
that
slow
and
grave
immutable
sweet
voice
of
yours
rises
and
falls
as
falls
a
wave
in
summer
on
forgotten
shores
pillage
they
will
trample
our
gardens
to
mire
they
will
bury
our
city
in
fire
our
women
await
their
desire
our
children
the
clang
of
the
chain
our
judges
and
lords
they
will
bind
by
the
neck
with
cords
and
harry
with
whips
and
swords
till
they
perish
of
shame
or
pain
and
the
great
lapis
lazuli
dome
where
the
gods
of
our
race
had
a
home
will
break
like
a
wave
from
the
foam
and
shred
into
fiery
rain
no
more
on
the
long
summer
days
shall
we
walk
in
the
ways
with
the
teachers
of
music
and
phrase
and
the
masters
of
dance
and
design
no
more
when
the
trumpeter
calls
shall
we
feast
in
the
halls
for
stayed
are
the
soft
footfalls
of
the
bearers
of
wine
and
lost
are
the
statues
of
kings
and
of
gods
with
great
glorious
wings
and
an
empire
of
beautiful
things
and
the
lips
of
the
love
who
was
mine
we
have
vanished
but
not
into
night
though
our
manhood
we
sold
to
delight
neglecting
the
chances
of
fight
unfit
for
the
spear
and
the
bow
we
are
dead
but
our
living
was
great
we
are
dumb
but
a
song
of
our
state
will
roam
in
the
desert
and
wait
with
its
burden
of
long
long
ago
till
a
scholar
from
lands
unearth
from
the
years
and
the
sands
some
image
with
beautiful
hands
and
know
what
we
want
him
to
know
the
ballad
of
zacho
a
greek
legend
zacho
the
king
rode
out
of
old
and
truth
is
what
i
tell
with
saddle
and
spurs
and
a
rein
of
gold
to
find
the
door
of
hell
and
round
around
him
surged
the
dead
with
soft
and
lustrous
eyes
why
came
you
here
old
friend
they
said
unwise
unwise
unwise
you
should
have
left
to
the
prince
your
son
spurs
and
saddle
and
rein
your
bright
and
morning
days
are
done
you
ride
not
out
again
i
came
to
greet
my
friends
who
fell
from
my
side
and
when
i
drunk
the
wine
of
hell
i
out
again
and
ride
but
charon
rose
and
caught
his
hair
in
fingers
sharp
and
long
loose
me
old
ferryman
play
fair
try
if
my
arm
be
strong
thrice
drave
he
hard
on
charon
breast
and
struck
him
thrice
to
ground
till
stranger
ghosts
came
out
o
the
west
and
sat
like
stars
around
and
thrice
old
charon
rose
up
high
and
seized
him
as
before
loose
me
a
broken
man
am
i
and
fight
with
you
no
more
zacho
arise
my
home
is
near
i
pray
you
walk
with
me
i
hung
my
tent
so
full
of
fear
you
well
may
shake
to
see
home
to
my
home
come
they
who
fight
who
fight
but
not
to
win
without
my
tent
is
black
as
night
and
red
as
fire
within
though
winds
blow
cold
and
i
grow
old
my
tent
is
fast
and
fair
the
pegs
are
dead
men
stout
right
arms
the
cords
their
golden
hair
pavlovna
in
london
i
listened
to
the
clown
sadder
than
he
i
heard
a
woman
sing
a
tall
dark
woman
in
a
scarlet
gown
and
saw
those
golden
toys
the
jugglers
fling
i
found
a
tawdry
room
and
there
sat
i
there
angled
for
each
murmur
soft
and
strange
the
from
darkness
and
below
i
watched
the
drinkers
laugh
the
lovers
sigh
and
thought
how
little
all
the
world
would
change
if
clowns
were
audience
and
we
the
show
what
starry
music
are
they
playing
now
what
dancing
in
this
dreary
theatre
who
is
she
with
the
moon
upon
her
brow
and
who
the
god
that
follows
her
follows
among
those
trees
in
their
parody
of
light
across
the
little
cardboard
balustrade
and
we
like
that
poor
faun
who
pipes
and
flees
adore
their
beauty
hate
it
for
too
bright
and
tremble
half
in
rapture
half
afraid
play
on
o
furtive
and
heartbroken
faun
what
is
your
thin
dull
pipe
for
such
as
they
i
know
you
blinded
by
the
least
white
dawn
and
dare
you
face
their
quick
and
quivering
day
dare
you
like
us
weak
but
undaunted
men
reliant
on
some
deathless
spark
in
you
turn
your
dull
eyes
to
what
the
gods
desire
touch
the
light
finger
of
your
goddess
then
after
a
second
flash
of
gold
and
blue
drunken
with
that
divinity
expire
o
dance
diana
dance
endymion
till
calm
ancestral
shadows
lay
their
hands
gently
across
mine
eyes
in
days
long
gone
have
i
not
danced
with
gods
in
garden
lands
i
too
a
wild
unsighted
atom
borne
deep
in
the
heart
of
some
heroic
boy
span
in
the
dance
ten
thousand
years
ago
and
while
his
young
eyes
glittered
in
the
morn
something
of
me
felt
something
of
his
joy
and
longed
to
rule
a
body
and
to
know
singer
long
dead
and
than
i
in
whose
proud
line
the
phrases
burn
would
you
could
praise
their
passionate
symmetry
who
loved
the
colder
shapes
the
attic
urn
but
your
far
song
my
faint
one
what
are
they
and
what
their
dance
and
faery
thoughts
and
ours
or
night
abloom
with
splendid
stars
and
pale
is
an
old
story
that
sweet
flowers
decay
and
dreams
the
noblest
die
as
soon
as
flowers
and
dancers
all
the
world
of
them
must
fail
the
sentimentalist
there
lies
a
photograph
of
you
deep
in
a
box
of
broken
things
this
was
the
face
i
loved
and
knew
five
years
ago
when
life
had
wings
five
years
ago
when
through
a
town
of
bright
and
soft
and
shadowy
bowers
we
walked
and
talked
and
trailed
our
gown
regardless
of
the
cinctured
hours
the
precepts
that
we
held
i
kept
proudly
my
ways
with
you
i
went
we
lived
our
dreams
while
others
slept
and
did
not
shrink
from
sentiment
now
i
go
east
and
you
stay
west
and
when
between
us
europe
lies
i
shall
forget
what
i
loved
best
away
from
lips
and
hands
and
eyes
but
we
were
gods
then
we
were
they
who
laughed
at
fools
believed
in
friends
and
drank
to
all
that
golden
day
before
us
which
this
poem
ends
don
juan
in
hell
from
baudelaire
the
night
don
juan
came
to
pay
his
fees
to
charon
by
the
caverned
water
shore
a
beggar
as
antisthenes
stretched
out
his
knotted
fingers
on
the
oar
mournful
with
drooping
breasts
and
robes
unsewn
the
shapes
of
women
swayed
in
ebon
skies
trailing
behind
him
with
a
restless
moan
like
cattle
herded
for
a
sacrifice
here
grinning
for
his
wage
stood
sganarelle
and
here
don
luis
pointed
bent
and
dim
to
show
the
dead
who
lined
the
holes
of
hell
this
was
that
impious
son
who
mocked
at
him
the
the
chaste
elvira
came
trembling
and
veiled
to
view
her
traitor
spouse
was
it
one
last
bright
smile
she
thought
to
claim
such
as
made
sweet
the
morning
of
his
vows
a
great
stone
man
rose
like
a
tower
on
board
stood
at
the
helm
and
cleft
the
flood
profound
but
the
calm
hero
leaning
on
his
sword
gazed
back
and
would
not
offer
one
look
round
the
ballad
of
iskander
aflatun
and
aristu
and
king
iskander
are
plato
aristotle
alexander
sultan
iskander
sat
him
down
on
his
golden
throne
in
his
golden
crown
and
shouted
wine
and
three
and
the
captain
ho
of
my
ships
at
sea
he
drank
his
bowl
of
wine
he
kept
the
dancing
till
they
wept
praised
and
kissed
their
painted
lips
and
turned
to
the
captain
of
all
his
ships
and
cried
o
lord
of
my
ships
that
go
from
the
persian
gulf
to
the
pits
of
snow
inquire
for
men
unknown
to
man
said
sultan
iskander
of
yoonistan
daroosh
is
dead
and
i
am
king
of
everywhere
and
everything
yet
leagues
and
leagues
away
for
sure
the
dream
of
war
admiral
i
command
you
sail
take
you
a
ship
of
silver
mail
and
fifty
sailors
young
and
bold
and
stack
provision
deep
in
the
hold
and
seek
out
twenty
men
that
know
all
babel
tongues
which
flaunt
and
flow
and
stay
impress
those
learned
two
old
aflatun
and
aristu
and
set
your
prow
ways
a
thousand
bright
and
dimpling
days
and
find
me
lords
with
breasts
to
feed
our
rusting
swords
the
captain
of
the
ships
bowed
low
sir
he
replied
i
will
do
so
and
down
he
rode
to
the
harbour
mouth
to
choose
a
boat
to
carry
him
south
and
he
launched
a
ship
of
silver
mail
with
fifty
lads
to
hoist
the
sail
and
twenty
wise
all
tongues
they
knew
and
aflatun
and
aristu
there
had
not
dawned
the
second
day
but
the
glittering
galleon
sailed
away
and
through
the
night
like
one
great
bell
the
marshalled
armies
sang
farewell
in
twenty
days
the
silver
ship
had
passed
the
isle
of
serendip
and
made
the
flat
araunian
coasts
inhabited
at
noon
by
ghosts
in
thirty
days
the
ship
was
far
beyond
the
land
of
calcobar
where
men
drink
dead
men
blood
for
wine
and
dye
their
beards
alizarine
but
on
the
hundredth
day
there
came
storm
with
his
windy
wings
aflame
and
drave
them
out
to
that
lone
sea
whose
shores
are
near
eternity
for
seven
years
and
seven
years
sailed
those
forgotten
mariners
nor
could
they
spy
on
either
hand
the
faintest
level
of
good
red
land
bird
or
fish
they
saw
not
one
there
swam
no
ship
beside
their
own
and
long
the
lilied
deep
lay
round
them
with
its
flowers
asleep
the
beams
began
to
warp
and
crack
the
silver
plates
turned
filthy
black
and
drooping
down
on
the
carven
rails
hung
those
once
lovely
silken
sails
and
all
the
great
ship
crew
who
were
such
noble
lads
to
do
and
dare
grew
old
and
tired
of
the
changeless
sky
and
laid
them
down
on
the
deck
to
die
and
they
who
spake
all
tongues
there
be
made
antics
with
solemnity
or
closely
huddled
each
to
each
talked
ribald
in
a
foreign
speech
and
aflatun
and
aristu
let
their
beards
grow
and
their
beards
grew
round
and
about
the
mainmast
tree
where
they
stood
still
and
watched
the
sea
and
day
by
day
their
captain
grey
knelt
on
the
rotting
poop
to
pray
and
yet
despite
ten
thousand
prayers
they
saw
no
ship
that
was
not
theirs
when
thrice
the
seven
years
had
passed
they
saw
a
ship
a
ship
at
last
untarnished
glowed
its
silver
mail
windless
bellied
its
silken
sail
with
a
shout
the
grizzled
sailors
rose
cursing
the
years
of
sick
repose
and
they
who
spake
in
tongues
unknown
gladly
reverted
to
their
own
the
captain
leapt
and
left
his
prayers
and
hastened
down
the
stairs
and
taking
to
hand
a
brazen
whip
he
woke
to
life
the
long
dead
ship
but
aflatun
and
aristu
who
had
no
work
that
they
could
do
gazed
at
the
stranger
ship
and
sea
with
their
beards
around
the
mainmast
tree
nearer
and
nearer
the
new
boat
came
till
the
hands
cried
out
on
the
old
ship
shame
silken
sail
to
a
silver
boat
we
too
shone
when
we
first
set
float
swifter
and
swifter
the
bright
boat
sped
but
the
hands
spake
thin
like
men
long
dead
how
striking
like
that
boat
were
we
in
the
days
sweet
days
when
we
put
to
sea
the
ship
all
black
and
the
ship
all
white
met
like
the
meeting
of
day
and
night
met
and
there
lay
serene
dark
green
a
twilight
yard
of
the
sea
between
and
the
twenty
masters
of
foreign
speech
of
every
tongue
they
knew
tried
each
smiling
the
silver
captain
heard
but
shook
his
head
and
said
no
word
then
aflatun
and
aristu
addressed
the
silver
lord
anew
speaking
their
language
of
yoonistan
like
countrymen
to
a
countryman
and
whence
they
cried
o
sons
of
pride
sail
you
the
dark
eternal
tide
lie
your
halls
to
the
south
or
north
and
who
is
the
king
that
sent
you
forth
we
live
replied
that
lord
with
a
smile
a
mile
beyond
the
millionth
mile
we
know
not
south
and
we
know
not
north
and
sultan
iskander
sent
us
forth
said
aristu
to
aflatun
surely
our
king
despondent
soon
has
sent
this
second
ship
to
find
unconquered
tracts
of
humankind
but
aflatun
turned
round
on
him
laughing
a
bitter
laugh
and
grim
alas
he
said
o
aristu
a
white
weak
thin
old
fool
are
you
and
does
yon
silver
ship
appear
as
she
had
journeyed
twenty
year
and
has
that
silver
captain
face
a
mortal
or
immortal
grace
theirs
is
the
land
as
well
i
know
where
live
the
shapes
of
things
below
theirs
is
the
country
where
they
keep
the
images
men
see
in
sleep
theirs
is
the
land
beyond
the
door
and
theirs
the
old
ideal
shore
they
steer
our
ship
behold
our
crew
ideal
and
our
captain
too
and
lo
beside
that
mainmast
tree
two
tall
and
shining
forms
i
see
and
they
are
what
we
ought
to
be
yet
we
are
they
and
they
are
we
he
spake
and
some
young
zephyr
stirred
the
two
ships
touched
no
sound
was
heard
the
black
ship
crumbled
into
air
only
the
phantom
ship
was
there
and
a
great
cry
rang
round
the
sky
of
glorious
singers
sweeping
by
and
calm
and
fair
on
waves
that
shone
the
silver
ship
sailed
on
and
on
