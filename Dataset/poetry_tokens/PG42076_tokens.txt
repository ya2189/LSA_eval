the

sings

still
its
notes
fall

in
cadence
full

the
song
that
waxeth
stronger
within
my
beating
heart
seems
but
a
second
measure
seems
of
the
sea
a
part
and
far
from
all
the
burdens
that
day
brings
in
its
train
my
soul
hath
found
elysium
renews
its
youth
again
i
hear
the
golden
billows
beat
on
the
shore
and
still
my
heart
is
singing
that
sweet
song
and
o
happy
youth
how
quickly
the
sands
of
life
have
run
the
shades
of
eve
are
falling
ere
yet
the
day
is
done
the
golden
sea
eternal
beats
loud
and
strong
and
free
and
bears
upon
its
bosom
a
joy
eternally
the
spirit
of
the
water
is
the
spirit
of
the
water
it
breathes
upon
the
sea
as
phantom
in
its
motions
it
glides
mysteriously
i
see
the
islands
that
deck
the
opal
bay
and
the
spirit
of
the
water
now
robed
in
mist
and
spray
the
charm
that
clings
eternal
to
ocean
fills
my
soul
as
waves
in
grandeur
pass
on
unto
their
goal
ye
phantoms
on
life
ocean
how
like
the
mist
ye
seem
as
backward
turneth
memory
across
life
glow
and
gleam
for
ye
figure
forth
life
pleasures
its
cares
its
tears
and
pain
and
recall
with
all
their
glamour
youth
joyous
dreams
again
while
still
the
fateful
presence
glides
on
across
the
wave
nor
lifts
its
veil
of
mystery
until
we
reach
the
grave
o
speak
is
it
endeavor
or
is
it
blighted
faith
or
is
it
but
the
passing
of
pain
this
silent
wraith
we
know
not
oh
we
know
not
here
for
life
restless
sea
we
too
glide
on
as
phantoms
all
this
side
eternity
with
the
tide
calm
seas
that
lie
summer
skies
and
mirror
back
those
skies
to
me
upon
whose
breast
white
sails
arise
and
glide
like
spirits
grand
and
free
calm
seas
beneath
whose
hidden
deep
are
wonders
far
beyond
my
ken
there
rocked
in
murmuring
currents
sleep
the
secrets
not
revealed
to
men
peace
like
a
dove
descends
and
hovers
the
waters
bright
while
glory
of
the
sunset
blends
with
tones
of
the
approaching
night
my
glad
soul
bids
thee
welcome
and
goes
forth
upon
the
ocean
tide
far
from
the
care
that
fills
the
land
to
where
my
spirit
would
abide
till
as
the
cares
of
day
depart
and
the
glad
sea
its
greeting
calls
i
rise
unshackled
strong
of
heart
and
from
my
life
the
burden
falls
thus
in
this
quiet
nook
i
find
all
that
i
longed
and
sought
in
vain
in
the
world
haunts
my
soul
to
bind
and
seeking
found
but
grief
and
pain
now
like
a
blessing
falls
thy
grace
o
grand
beloved
glorious
sea
drawn
by
thy
message
face
to
face
my
longing
greets
thy
mystery
grand
manan
o
solemn
cliffs
of
grand
manan
in
silent
might
ye
rise
as
bounded
by
th
eternal
sea
and
by
the
azure
skies
like
a
proud
soul
that
stands
apart
unknown
unloved
unsought
ye
guard
your
stronghold
silently
through
many
battles
fought
the
sweeps
across
your
wall
and
seaward
shapes
his
course
while
at
your
feet
the
waves
beat
loud
in
measure
wild
and
hoarse
o
solemn
heights
o
grand
and
calm
ye
hold
my
heart
in
thrall
and
not
a
sound
is
heard
beyond
the
ocean
rise
and
fall
but
as
the
waves
beat
strong
and
loud
upon
your
rugged
shore
through
it
the
sea
sad
monotone
i
hear
forevermore
the
sunset
glow
hath
kissed
your
heights
as
loth
to
leave
you
yet
and
bathed
in
glories
red
and
gold
the
eve
and
you
have
met
the
boat
speeds
on
we
may
not
stay
but
from
my
brooding
heart
your
image
while
this
life
remains
can
nevermore
depart
leeward
o
for
the
bounding
wave
and
the
salt
salt
spray
on
my
face
for
the
sweep
of
the
filling
sail
and
its
free
untrammeled
pace
for
the
life
that
hath
no
bound
to
its
path
but
the
open
sea
for
the
soul
as
free
as
air
that
by
right
belongs
to
me
for
power
to
cast
aside
these
fetters
dark
and
strong
to
bound
over
heaving
deep
and
no
more
to
feel
the
thong
that
cuts
through
the
quivering
heart
and
the
restless
soul
as
well
i
yearn
for
a
fuller
life
with
a
might
i
can
not
quell
o
for
the
bounding
wave
and
the
salt
salt
spray
on
my
face
for
the
strength
to
grasp
and
hold
the
plan
of
a
waning
race
for
might
to
compel
the
tide
in
its
turn
to
serve
my
will
that
my
heart
of
the
fountain
deep
may
drink
to
the
brim
its
fill
songs
of
the
fields
and
woods
a
song
in
the
evening
o
sweetest
bird
that
ever
sang
in
notes
of
wild
rejoicing
thine
as
first
it
rang
was
thrilling
in
its
voicing
i
felt
thy
rapture
as
i
heard
thy
song
in
all
its
beauty
to
me
it
scarce
seemed
but
a
bird
was
life
and
love
and
duty
i
could
not
see
thy
tiny
form
as
softly
closed
the
gloaming
and
like
a
wanderer
in
the
storm
my
heart
was
blindly
roaming
while
as
thy
song
rang
pure
and
clear
sweet
smell
of
the
haying
sped
back
through
many
a
year
both
light
and
shade
displaying
and
still
thy
notes
of
tone
came
clear
mead
and
river
with
tender
meaning
all
its
own
and
trilled
and
trilled
forever
o
heart
it
sang
let
thine
own
life
become
a
song
to
others
that
thou
mayst
count
them
in
the
strife
not
alien
but
as
brothers
sing
on
sing
on
thy
notes
repeat
sing
life
and
love
and
duty
that
mystic
three
whose
names
replete
are
with
heavenly
beauty
sing
life
the
gift
of
ray
divine
that
pierced
the
gloom
of
even
the
first
upon
our
path
to
shine
a
heritage
of
heaven
and
love
oh
what
were
life
without
this
second
gift
eternal
that
bids
the
glad
earth
blossom
out
in
summer
garb
supernal
yet
love
and
life
were
both
in
vain
were
duty
not
a
flower
that
springs
beneath
the
blesséd
rain
to
crown
life
darkest
hour
not
unto
me
a
bird
that
eve
in
notes
of
earth
was
singing
but
a
pure
voice
its
way
did
cleave
from
heaven
its
message
bringing
meadow
bloom
my
one
wee
bud
that
grows
in
the
meadow
far
apart
from
the
flaunting
garden
blooms
afar
where
the
brook
and
birds
are
singing
and
the
soft
noon
haze
the
distance
looms
my
one
wee
bud
but
to
grow
so
bravely
where
the
rushes
rise
from
the
moorland
green
where
birds
skim
close
the
grassy
billows
and
the
low
breeze
murmurs
its
plaint
between
my
one
wee
song
i
sing
in
the
even
when
the
home
doth
gather
its
loved
ones
close
and
the
world
afar
and
hearts
grow
nearer
and
the
jar
of
life
sinks
into
repose
my
one
wee
song
like
a
flower
growing
in
this
life
of
mine
that
were
else
so
bare
ah
shalt
thou
go
forth
to
do
my
bidding
my
love
shall
he
cull
it
as
blossom
fair
ah
flower
and
song
be
this
thy
meaning
thy
mission
of
love
in
the
world
is
clear
the
grace
once
born
of
seed
sown
in
shadow
shall
bloom
in
the
hearts
that
now
hold
thee
dear
a
song
of
the
autumn
scarlet
and
gold
and
crimson
their
banners
flung
to
the
breeze
like
monarchs
brilliant
vesture
the
ranks
of
the
maple
trees
golden
and
brown
and
russet
the
oaks
in
their
autumn
dress
soldiers
in
ranks
deploying
to
the
front
they
onward
press
pale
in
their
coats
of
yellow
tinged
and
with
orange
flecked
the
chestnuts
on
the
hillside
as
with
royalty
bedecked
scarlet
and
gold
and
crimson
and
golden
and
russet
brown
pale
with
a
yellow
are
the
leaves
now
fluttering
down
garb
of
the
season
bringing
majestic
it
decks
the
hills
and
autumn
lavish
splendor
the
soul
with
its
beauty
fills
the
iris
adown
the
grassy
hill
they
come
to
greet
me
every
morn
those
little
maids
in
norman
caps
of
joy
and
born
they
march
demurely
side
by
side
how
many
pair
there
be
far
as
mine
eye
can
reach
their
forms
in
green
and
white
i
see
each
sister
wears
with
youthful
grace
her
snowy
norman
cap
and
in
the
long
procession
there
i
see
no
pause
or
gap
and
so
i
watch
to
see
them
come
as
morn
by
morn
i
pass
the
green
of
shimmering
robe
and
glint
of
snow
within
the
grass
they
never
speak
and
yet
they
nod
a
friendly
greeting
there
and
all
their
beauty
round
me
seems
a
fragrance
in
the
air
i
speak
to
them
oh
yes
i
speak
and
lovingly
i
bid
them
welcome
every
summer
morn
those
maids
with
downcast
lid
they
are
so
modest
pure
and
fair
they
are
so
very
sweet
i
fain
would
linger
there
and
call
them
clustering
round
my
feet
far
backward
in
the
view
my
eyes
the
slow
procession
see
and
yet
they
never
leave
the
path
nor
can
they
speak
to
me
is
the
growing
tall
amid
the
meadow
grass
the
iris
as
we
often
call
each
lass
in
couples
stately
there
they
stand
as
far
as
eye
can
scan
and
round
them
waves
the
nodding
grass
as
homage
due
from
man
they
stand
a
line
of
vestals
pure
or
each
a
nun
while
on
each
snowy
cap
there
falls
the
radiance
of
the
sun
although
the
power
of
speech
may
not
be
theirs
in
worldly
phrase
they
teach
a
lesson
just
as
true
and
just
as
full
of
praise
in
their
allotted
path
they
walk
and
fill
their
destined
end
their
beauty
gladdens
every
eye
as
down
the
hill
they
wend
o
if
ye
make
one
heart
in
rapture
rise
if
ye
but
waken
one
pure
thought
to
bloom
in
paradise
then
have
your
lives
though
brief
as
boon
to
mortal
man
been
given
to
draw
from
earth
his
sordid
thoughts
and
bid
them
rest
on
heaven
liebeslieder
liebeslied
like
a
frail
shell
on
the
breast
of
the
ocean
sways
now
my
heart
to
the
rhythm
of
thine
cradled
is
borne
on
the
crest
of
emotion
sinks
in
the
deep
of
a
languor
divine
and
as
the
shell
the
wild
waves
onward
carry
so
doth
thy
love
bear
my
heart
to
its
shore
here
on
its
golden
sands
blissful
to
tarry
held
in
thy
fond
clasp
to
wander
no
more
lay
thy
dear
lips
to
my
lips
oh
my
lover
read
in
mine
eyes
all
my
tongue
may
not
tell
love
as
a
bee
gaily
sips
gallant
rover
rove
thou
no
more
nay
i
yield
to
thy
spell
i
longing
oh
to
be
out
on
the
ocean
where
the
waves
beat
wild
and
free
where
there
naught
the
sky
and
billows
but
the
boat
and
you
and
me
where
the
winds
with
their
touch
caress
us
and
the
sweep
on
high
and
the
bell
from
its
rocky
outpost
sends
forth
its
warning
cry
oh
to
be
out
on
the
ocean
with
the
cold
salt
spray
to
dash
athwart
the
bows
of
the
vessel
and
foaming
to
merrily
lash
the
boat
to
freer
effort
as
she
plunges
with
life
the
crest
of
the
bounding
billows
and
above
their
surging
strife
oh
to
be
out
on
the
ocean
with
no
heart
you
and
me
with
no
bond
that
must
bind
forever
here
but
strong
and
brave
and
free
with
the
song
of
grand
old
ocean
as
it
lulls
us
on
its
breast
with
the
thought
of
a
perfect
union
and
of
perfect
love
and
rest
oh
to
be
out
on
the
ocean
although
storms
rise
dark
and
strong
though
by
wind
and
by
wave
through
the
tempest
we
sweep
our
way
along
till
the
stars
come
out
in
the
heavens
and
the
wind
has
sunk
to
rest
and
i
list
to
words
of
comfort
as
i
lean
on
your
faithful
breast
oh
to
be
out
on
the
ocean
and
to
leave
the
din
and
strife
to
taste
but
once
more
of
freedom
and
to
drink
of
the
wine
of
life
oh
to
be
out
on
the
ocean
where
the
waves
beat
wild
and
free
with
naught
the
sky
and
the
billows
but
the
boat
and
you
and
me
ii
on
the
sea
the
answer
we
are
sailing
over
the
crest
of
the
billow
afar
from
the
world
and
its
sorrow
and
pain
while
i
on
thy
soft
breast
my
head
now
may
pillow
and
lull
me
to
rest
and
to
peace
once
again
nay
love
how
thy
heart
in
its
prison
is
beating
it
throbs
mine
ear
as
a
fluttering
bird
while
swift
to
my
lips
comes
thy
low
song
repeating
the
lilt
of
the
waves
in
a
measure
for
oh
to
be
out
on
the
ocean
the
ocean
and
oh
to
be
far
from
the
world
love
with
thee
it
rises
and
falls
with
the
waves
rhythmic
motion
is
filled
with
night
balm
as
with
starbeams
the
sea
with
naught
the
sky
and
the
billows
now
singing
the
words
keep
repeating
the
tender
refrain
but
the
boat
comes
once
more
in
cadence
clear
ringing
the
sky
and
billows
i
hear
it
again
now
save
thee
and
me
falls
the
song
in
its
measure
across
the
wide
ocean
of
thought
love
from
thee
and
i
know
to
my
heart
deep
mysterious
treasure
thy
love
like
a
bird
flies
to
harbor
with
me
nay
how
could
we
dream
that
time
trackless
ocean
thy
soul
thus
responsive
should
answer
to
mine
or
that
out
of
the
chalice
of
silent
emotion
my
heart
drink
in
equal
communion
with
thine
the
red
rose
i
pinned
a
red
rose
my
heart
the
rose
my
lover
gave
to
me
with
many
vows
and
tender
words
my
love
my
own
i
love
but
thee
i
wore
the
red
rose
my
heart
that
summer
day
with
gladness
and
knew
not
doubt
nor
haunting
care
nor
slightest
touch
of
sadness
but
ah
a
thorn
within
my
heart
a
thorn
of
false
love
planting
deceit
had
pressed
its
bitter
sting
my
life
forever
haunting
i
took
the
red
rose
from
my
heart
no
more
oh
love
is
blowing
the
thorn
lies
deep
within
my
breast
where
never
sign
is
showing
the
maiden
and
the
boat
a
fair
little
boat
went
sailing
the
sea
far
over
the
bright
blue
wave
and
she
dipped
and
gay
and
free
as
became
a
craft
so
brave
a
blithe
young
maiden
a
song
of
love
sang
out
on
the
summer
air
the
birds
took
the
notes
on
their
boughs
above
and
answered
her
cheerily
there
as
the
boat
went
out
and
over
the
bar
the
white
sails
set
to
the
breeze
her
clear
song
followed
on
pinions
afar
the
birds
sang
forth
from
the
trees
o
boat
in
your
path
to
the
rising
sun
to
that
land
beyond
the
sea
pray
what
is
the
cargo
your
journey
done
you
will
bear
her
if
fate
decree
for
you
take
her
heart
on
your
snowy
deck
where
love
is
now
high
priest
and
you
take
her
troth
may
there
be
no
wreck
no
tempest
out
of
the
east
will
you
bring
her
the
perfect
love
she
gave
and
keep
it
unsoiled
and
true
will
you
bring
her
a
heart
as
strong
and
brave
as
the
one
she
gives
to
you
else
what
does
it
matter
if
wreck
betide
or
the
sun
go
down
in
cloud
it
were
better
for
her
this
day
you
died
than
that
love
should
wear
a
shroud
it
were
better
far
that
her
song
were
mute
to
swell
forth
a
later
day
for
love
that
hath
never
a
constant
root
must
fade
and
wither
away
so
boat
sail
on
if
you
be
not
true
and
maiden
oh
hush
that
song
for
the
years
that
are
coming
swift
to
you
bear
a
dearer
love
along
my
ship
one
day
i
cast
my
lot
upon
the
troublous
tides
of
life
and
ventured
all
my
hoarded
love
upon
its
fitful
strife
on
one
frail
mortal
like
myself
i
set
the
store
of
years
and
freighted
well
the
ship
that
day
with
all
my
hopes
and
fears
with
all
my
hopes
for
fears
were
not
upon
that
happy
day
and
never
sign
of
cloud
uprose
above
my
sunlit
way
ah
me
can
life
bring
again
such
perfect
trust
as
this
such
eager
hopes
such
joyous
dreams
of
ever
present
bliss
my
ship
sailed
forth
to
many
a
storm
she
bared
her
gallant
breast
and
still
she
sails
the
wide
wide
seas
but
never
finding
rest
one
day
ah
me
is
years
ago
since
first
i
saw
her
sail
and
sent
my
prayers
and
tears
for
her
above
the
gathering
gale
will
she
come
back
my
noble
ship
and
captain
brave
and
crew
of
joys
and
hopes
and
high
resolves
of
love
both
deep
and
true
or
solemn
thought
shall
she
find
the
haven
here
below
but
anchor
in
the
silent
land
beyond
life
ebb
and
flow
beyond
vain
fret
and
fond
regard
and
strivings
to
see
the
reason
why
so
oft
denied
our
dearest
hopes
should
be
an
old
song
drink
to
me
only
with
thine
eyes
and
i
will
pledge
with
mine
i
read
in
this
old
song
anew
this
living
love
of
thine
the
old
old
song
that
in
the
days
now
swift
and
sure
are
fled
recalls
its
sparkle
and
its
mirth
oblivious
of
its
dead
it
served
to
bear
as
lover
gift
all
tender
thought
and
true
it
wove
among
the
garlands
sweet
red
roses
never
rue
drink
to
me
only
with
thine
eyes
ay
with
thy
tender
eyes
and
read
in
mine
from
thee
my
own
heart
sweet
surprise
and
i
will
pledge
with
mine
dear
love
yea
pledge
a
the
hours
of
life
that
thou
alone
in
shalt
enfold
only
within
thy
dark
grave
eyes
would
i
be
mirrored
now
and
only
from
thy
folded
lips
learn
love
own
cherished
vow
drink
to
me
only
with
thine
eyes
and
i
will
pledge
with
mine
while
overhead
above
life
stream
shines
out
love
star
divine
and
life
no
more
is
dark
and
drear
and
storms
no
more
may
break
where
love
own
glorious
light
shines
forth
and
bids
the
heart
awake
to
miss
wearing
a
rose
may
o
happy
rose
that
bloometh
upon
her
gentle
breast
of
all
thy
joyous
hours
this
is
in
truth
the
best
not
sweeter
is
thy
fragrance
upon
the
balmy
air
than
her
pure
spirit
sheddeth
so
blithe
and
debonnaire
o
happy
rose
that
lieth
upon
that
bosom
white
to
thee
kind
fate
hath
granted
a
goal
of
pure
delight
in
vain
i
sigh
and
murmur
thy
lot
all
envious
view
and
seek
in
vain
to
stifle
this
moment
pungent
rue
o
happy
rose
as
lying
beneath
her
light
caress
now
whisper
to
her
softly
what
i
may
not
confess
and
tell
her
she
is
fairer
than
bloom
of
earth
in
that
her
soul
exhaleth
all
virtues
pure
and
bright
the
cloud
a
cloud
scarce
larger
than
a
feather
uprose
in
love
bright
sky
one
day
but
ah
it
grew
to
stormy
weather
and
shrouded
all
the
sun
bright
ray
a
little
cloud
but
ah
the
sorrow
that
springs
from
bitter
words
that
jar
how
deep
the
pain
from
which
we
borrow
how
strong
the
wall
that
forms
the
bar
we
may
in
grow
tender
and
strive
to
read
our
lives
aright
but
if
to
love
its
due
we
render
we
know
life
thread
at
best
is
slight
what
if
the
look
the
word
but
spoken
had
been
the
last
we
ever
met
ah
life
had
been
too
short
too
broken
its
pang
forever
to
forget
sehnsucht
my
heart
grows
faint
with
longing
and
with
love
as
in
the
twilight
comes
thy
face
and
closer
closer
drawn
by
threads
that
bind
thee
to
me
all
our
tender
joys
i
trace
in
lines
and
lasting
as
the
stone
when
sculptor
art
transforms
it
into
life
that
erst
were
soulless
marble
still
and
poor
to
mirror
forth
our
hope
or
joy
or
strife
in
lines
yea
on
my
living
heart
that
slumbered
its
veil
of
seeming
death
thou
tracest
characters
full
bold
and
deep
and
breathest
now
with
breath
thus
was
love
born
to
me
who
deemed
it
cast
behind
me
with
the
shadows
and
the
blight
that
fell
on
trusting
heart
and
life
and
home
and
wrapped
my
soul
in
darkest
tones
of
night
nay
but
thy
love
has
waked
me
and
i
live
for
love
and
life
are
guests
of
mine
thine
eyes
have
told
me
lover
sweetest
tale
and
tender
lips
have
sealed
me
wholly
thine
so
if
within
the
hours
apart
we
walk
ofttimes
in
paths
that
take
us
from
our
nest
the
nest
we
built
with
loving
heart
and
hands
it
takes
not
from
us
love
nor
trust
nor
rest
it
takes
them
not
no
hand
but
ours
can
rob
each
other
of
this
gift
surpassing
all
no
hand
but
ours
can
bind
or
break
this
bond
and
from
no
other
hand
but
ours
can
fall
blight
or
distrust
or
grief
or
bitter
pain
and
so
my
own
in
this
we
builded
well
if
through
life
storm
or
sunshine
there
shall
fall
no
grief
or
loss
our
lips
may
ever
tell
my
heart
grows
faint
with
longing
and
with
love
and
yet
i
know
i
must
not
keep
thee
a
tender
to
my
amorous
will
such
chain
as
that
ill
that
thou
shouldst
wear
i
would
not
have
thee
swayed
dear
love
by
aught
thy
manhood
would
disclaim
nor
would
i
hold
thee
prisoner
to
my
clinging
heart
its
pleading
touch
would
seek
to
thee
enfold
love
can
not
live
where
faith
and
trust
are
not
love
will
not
brook
a
gilded
chain
to
wear
and
where
the
fetters
bind
the
bird
sweet
song
is
hushed
the
skies
above
no
more
are
fair
but
i
would
hold
thee
in
my
heart
of
hearts
so
little
prisoner
that
thou
shouldst
stray
from
love
dear
shrine
but
through
the
waning
years
our
should
grow
dearer
day
by
day
selection
yes
hold
me
closer
closer
in
thy
arms
and
closer
to
thy
beating
heart
that
i
secure
in
all
that
crowns
a
woman
lot
may
now
with
thee
the
bitter
past
defy
yet
would
i
not
call
down
an
envious
doom
on
any
of
the
future
sunny
days
ill
in
me
to
tempt
the
fates
i
trow
but
rather
as
one
pleading
kneels
and
prays
stay
but
thy
hand
o
time
and
pitying
grant
us
of
thy
sunny
sheaves
of
harvest
day
hours
brimmed
with
sweetness
and
all
glad
with
love
that
passing
on
we
scarce
may
heed
the
way
that
erst
was
strewn
with
sharpest
stones
and
weeds
so
lead
us
gently
time
we
may
not
miss
aught
of
life
joy
or
of
its
brilliant
light
or
missing
crave
a
fuller
cup
than
this
yes
hold
me
closer
closer
let
me
rest
my
head
content
above
thy
throbbing
heart
struggle
and
bay
of
laurel
are
the
world
but
this
my
own
dear
love
the
better
part
fame
and
ambition
lo
do
not
they
burn
with
all
the
lurid
light
and
gleam
of
earth
love
silent
and
benign
an
influence
sheds
and
heralds
forth
in
life
a
higher
birth
vain
is
ambition
yea
or
conquered
goal
to
bind
my
heart
or
satisfy
me
here
then
hold
me
closer
closer
to
thee
love
for
this
i
give
it
all
hold
thou
me
near
legendary
songs
the
mansion
that
endured
this
legend
in
prose
i
found
in
a
french
collection
and
have
believed
it
would
be
acceptable
rendered
into
verse
back
in
olden
time
when
emperors
ruled
the
land
where
tiber
flows
proud
and
stern
dwelt
gondoforus
as
the
ancient
legend
shows
as
he
mused
in
hours
of
leisure
came
into
his
brain
this
thought
straight
i
build
for
mine
own
glory
here
a
palace
deftly
wrought
of
the
richest
gold
and
silver
with
the
choicest
gems
bedecked
that
shall
on
my
house
and
lineage
still
a
greater
light
reflect
shall
outshine
the
roman
in
its
beauty
and
its
worth
place
his
lordly
structure
the
lesser
of
the
earth
so
he
sent
his
message
speeding
to
the
regions
far
and
near
that
some
great
and
cunning
builder
might
at
his
command
appear
when
one
day
with
mien
all
lowly
wrapped
about
in
garments
gray
stood
the
architect
before
him
his
behest
to
now
essay
spoke
his
will
and
gondoforus
went
forth
proudly
unto
war
days
and
months
sped
on
unheeded
still
no
word
came
from
afar
yet
the
architect
wrought
silent
though
he
touched
nor
plan
nor
pen
for
the
palace
he
was
building
was
not
seen
by
eyes
of
men
while
unto
the
poor
and
wretched
freely
of
the
gold
gave
he
precious
stones
were
turned
to
healing
needs
of
poor
humanity
back
returning
flushed
with
victory
gondoforus
came
apace
sought
in
vain
to
view
his
palace
bare
and
empty
was
its
place
then
he
sent
with
sternest
message
for
the
architect
and
said
caitiff
what
is
now
thy
showing
answer
by
thy
hoary
head
thomas
he
who
doubting
lingered
when
his
fellows
pressed
to
claim
as
their
risen
lord
the
saviour
spake
oh
thou
of
kingly
name
lo
thy
house
is
even
builded
but
the
warrior
bade
them
cast
in
deep
dungeon
him
who
trifled
with
his
will
there
bind
him
fast
while
he
planned
the
subtlest
torment
for
the
traitor
aged
frame
while
he
doomed
with
keenest
vengeance
him
to
torture
death
and
shame
but
as
in
his
rage
he
pondered
sleep
him
held
him
chained
and
a
vision
hovered
near
him
earthly
sense
grew
dim
and
waned
then
the
spirit
of
his
brother
swiftly
to
his
side
drew
nigh
said
in
words
that
thrilled
his
being
he
whom
thou
hast
doomed
to
die
is
the
servant
of
the
mighty
is
an
instrument
of
grace
for
the
angels
now
have
shown
me
where
no
narrow
walls
have
place
and
where
dwell
the
hosts
eternal
reared
in
all
its
beauty
there
lo
a
house
of
precious
jewels
and
of
ornament
most
fair
fashioned
of
the
precious
metals
thou
wouldst
fain
have
builded
here
fashioned
with
a
grace
and
glory
that
on
earth
doth
not
appear
thus
in
paradise
there
standeth
waiting
thee
a
house
divine
which
the
architect
hath
fashioned
all
on
earth
to
now
outshine
then
the
vision
paled
and
vanished
gondoforus
straightway
sped
to
the
captive
who
awaiting
bowed
in
prayer
his
aged
head
gondoforus
knelt
before
him
then
the
holy
thomas
spoke
as
he
raised
the
humble
warrior
crushed
beneath
the
vision
stroke
knowest
not
o
king
the
mansions
that
endure
are
reared
on
high
builded
there
for
us
in
heaven
by
our
faith
and
charity
the
chimes
on
fair
lake
como
sunny
brink
an
ancient
monastery
stood
close
to
the
mountain
steep
ascent
as
nestling
its
snowy
hood
and
there
a
pale
young
artisan
his
cunning
plied
a
wondrous
chime
he
sought
to
frame
that
those
who
loved
the
beauty
of
that
molten
rhyme
within
the
valley
breadth
should
hear
pealing
at
morn
and
even
clear
for
years
he
toiled
content
if
he
at
last
might
frame
a
chime
so
sweet
that
pilgrims
oft
would
silent
pause
to
hear
the
music
glad
repeat
borne
the
tranquil
waters
reach
and
bringing
swift
unto
the
heart
its
tones
of
warning
praise
and
love
that
nevermore
should
then
depart
such
was
the
thought
he
wove
and
prayed
that
his
life
work
be
holy
made
the
day
came
when
that
perfect
chime
was
placed
aloft
its
song
to
wing
forth
the
waters
silent
reach
and
to
the
convent
roof
to
bring
the
lost
and
wayworn
traveller
from
the
busy
haunts
of
world
and
strife
back
where
the
calm
of
prayer
might
prove
the
to
eternal
life
then
was
the
artisan
as
one
whose
dearest
here
was
done
not
so
was
yet
to
be
a
lifelong
task
a
path
to
lead
through
many
a
land
in
futile
search
stony
ways
where
feet
should
bleed
not
yet
his
soul
high
guerdon
find
the
prize
his
hands
had
placed
aloft
how
rarely
here
on
earth
we
see
life
morning
fill
its
promise
soft
not
yet
was
he
to
find
his
rest
beside
lake
como
lovely
breast
a
savage
horde
the
land
and
bore
away
the
prizéd
chime
afar
from
peaceful
como
side
to
some
unknown
and
distant
clime
in
vain
the
artisan
complained
beneath
a
fate
unkind
he
drew
no
comfort
from
lament
or
prayer
for
peace
no
more
his
hearthstone
knew
then
as
one
day
he
brooding
mused
and
consolation
sweet
refused
he
seemed
to
see
before
his
eyes
a
land
outspread
wherein
his
feet
should
wander
seeking
ever
there
his
loved
and
lost
his
chime
so
sweet
he
rose
at
once
he
sought
no
aid
but
bowed
his
head
in
silent
prayer
then
from
his
home
he
straightway
passed
that
no
one
might
his
purpose
share
and
leaving
home
and
rest
that
day
with
breaking
heart
went
on
his
way
he
heard
in
foreign
land
some
wondrous
story
of
a
chime
whose
tones
were
liquid
notes
of
song
whose
bells
rang
out
a
gladsome
rhyme
he
journeyed
to
that
storied
place
nor
paused
till
he
should
reach
the
spot
only
to
find
his
quest
in
vain
while
yet
those
bells
were
forgot
each
day
his
soul
went
up
in
prayer
that
those
clear
chimes
might
pierce
the
air
thus
journeyed
he
for
many
a
year
while
locks
of
gold
had
turned
to
grey
till
in
a
distant
land
he
strayed
and
heard
at
close
of
summer
day
the
old
sweet
song
rung
by
his
chime
he
long
had
listened
for
in
vain
quickly
rose
tears
in
lifted
eyes
quickly
his
heart
renounced
its
pain
o
loved
and
lost
for
many
a
day
you
called
me
from
my
youth
away
for
now
on
foreign
strand
he
waits
alone
in
age
alone
in
kin
listening
as
listens
one
who
bides
outside
of
heaven
to
praise
within
not
vain
his
search
not
lost
his
love
he
feels
once
more
the
throb
ere
cruel
foes
his
prize
had
no
more
may
they
his
treasure
rob
his
life
went
forth
in
one
glad
cry
beneath
that
alien
sky
was
ended
all
the
tender
search
the
hours
of
pain
and
sleepless
toil
there
where
no
loved
his
hand
might
clasp
there
on
that
wild
and
foreign
soil
but
deep
within
his
heart
was
writ
his
purpose
pure
his
steadfast
search
and
lo
his
chime
still
calls
to
prayer
and
still
peals
forth
from
ivied
church
the
bells
once
blessed
by
saintly
hands
now
call
in
limerick
god
commands
my
story
done
what
need
to
say
he
sleeps
as
well
and
sweetly
there
beneath
that
arch
of
foreign
sky
as
in
his
native
land
so
fair
he
found
ere
death
had
met
his
feet
the
prize
he
sought
with
spirit
brave
and
finding
was
content
to
lie
afar
from
como
in
his
grave
love
was
the
goal
that
led
his
feet
to
peace
and
deathless
calm
replete
the
chimes
ah
well
perhaps
they
peal
no
less
the
sweetly
that
their
note
in
alien
lands
the
tidings
bring
they
still
to
god
their
praise
devote
and
though
their
maker
no
more
hears
the
liquid
music
of
each
tone
they
speak
to
those
whose
living
needs
make
of
the
chimes
their
very
own

francis
coster
story
i
came
across
this
legend
in
prose
some
time
ago
to
which
was
prefixed
this
note
the
following
exquisite
story
was
written
by
anthony
of
sienna
and
translated
from
the
dominican
records
by
francis
coster
a
famous
preacher
of
the
sixteenth
century
gould
author
of
of
the
middle
ages
has
succeeded
in
rendering
it
into
current
english
in
rendering
the
story
into
verse
i
have
kept
to
the
text
as
closely
as
possible
once
i
read
in
olden
story
lived
a
holy
man
of
god
and
two
children
his
guidance
through
life
pitfalls
safely
trod
every
day
returning
duties
found
them
docile
at
his
side
there
to
draw
from
wisdom
fountain
all
his
tender
care
supplied
but
the
day
first
freshest
hour
at
the
altar
found
them
prone
gladly
giving
to
their
savior
all
he
claimeth
as
his
own
there
they
served
with
purest
offering
at
the
sacrifice
sublime
knelt
responded
and
with
reverence
sounded
oft
the
bell
clear
chime
and
this
duty
then
completed
to
the
little
chapel
door
turned
their
feet
and
entering
vanished
there
to
eat
their
humble
store
but
one
day
their
teacher
seeking
spake
the
elder
one
full
clear
tell
us
father
what
fair
infant
doth
so
oft
to
us
appear
then
the
priest
replied
in
accents
full
of
tender
loving
care
son
i
know
not
him
you
speak
of
who
with
thee
thy
task
doth
share
but
they
came
again
unto
him
day
by
day
with
urgent
word
and
it
was
with
deepest
wonder
that
their
simple
tale
he
heard
and
he
asked
of
what
sort
is
he
and
they
answered
him
again
father
he
is
clad
in
raiment
seamless
and
without
a
stain
but
whence
cometh
he
replying
spoke
the
priest
in
accents
mild
and
they
answered
from
the
altar
as
it
were
descends
the
child
and
we
asked
him
then
to
share
with
us
of
our
milk
and
bread
and
he
doth
right
willingly
this
is
what
the
children
said
and
the
priest
was
full
of
wonder
to
the
children
then
spake
he
are
there
marks
whereby
to
know
him
if
mine
eyes
the
child
should
see
yes
my
father
yes
he
beareth
in
his
hands
and
in
his
feet
wounds
that
pierce
his
tender
body
these
the
words
that
they
repeat
from
his
hands
the
crimson
liquid
on
the
bread
he
taketh
flows
till
beneath
his
touch
it
blusheth
like
the
deep
heart
of
the
rose
then
with
awe
replied
their
master
o
my
sons
list
unto
me
know
it
is
the
sweet
child
jesus
the
holy
one
that
you
did
see
when
again
he
cometh
to
you
with
these
words
your
greeting
be
hast
breakfasted
with
us
grant
we
three
may
sup
with
thee
then
the
children
did
his
bidding
sweetly
then
the
child
did
say
be
it
so
on
thursday
next
be
it
on
ascension
day
on
that
day
they
came
rejoicing
but
they
brought
nor
milk
nor
bread
served
they
at
the
mass
right
gladly
pax
vobiscum
then
was
said
but
they
still
knelt
on
unheeding
thus
they
fell
in
christ
asleep
master
children
with
their
savior
then
his
did
keep
songs
on
the
heights
the
old
cemetery
lo
half
way
up
the
hill
i
pause
to
turn
within
the
ancient
gate
and
enter
ground
now
hallowéd
the
silent
city
where
they
wait
in
perfect
rest
till
he
shall
bid
them
rise
who
now
in
sleep
are
laid
whose
life
and
death
and
waiting
on
him
in
childlike
faith
is
stayed
no
sound
is
heard
within
the
spot
save
the
soft
wind
among
the
trees
or
song
of
insect
busy
hum
or
low
of
herd
upon
the
breeze
i
walk
graves
of
those
long
dead
who
lived
and
suffered
strove
and
won
and
now
have
entered
into
life
while
we
say
their
life
is
done
i
fain
would
take
when
i
return
into
the
world
wild
rush
and
roar
the
peace
of
this
fair
autumn
day
that
it
bide
with
me
evermore
that
i
may
learn
from
this
blest
spot
where
sleep
the
dead
who
in
the
lord
now
take
their
rest
that
life
is
more
than
idle
jest
than
passing
word
than
anxious
effort
for
the
bread
that
perisheth
yea
more
that
life
is
as
a
vessel
given
of
precious
ointment
that
we
bear
and
fear
that
we
its
freight
may
waste
ere
we
may
yield
it
to
his
care
lines
on
immortality
poor
trembling
soul
within
this
frame
of
clay
that
vainly
questioneth
wouldst
fain
essay
the
problem
that
nor
time
nor
man
may
solve
around
which
cycles
evermore
revolve
not
till
the
light
upon
thy
quest
is
born
that
only
beams
in
an
immortal
morn
shalt
thou
be
satisfied
thy
fears
allayed
and
freed
from
earth
a
new
creation
made
a
dream
i
dreamed
and
lo
upon
the
silent
earth
that
ever
swings
as
from
its
misty
birth
i
kinless
stood
and
all
the
streams
that
erst
in
joyous
measure
sang
me
forth
their
tale
sank
to
a
murmur
even
while
there
burst
upon
mine
eyes
that
straightway
turned
me
pale
i
looked
and
wondered
and
i
grew
as
chill
as
though
their
fated
touch
had
froze
my
blood
as
far
beyond
that
living
hill
in
breathless
awe
mine
eyes
were
turned
i
stood
appalled
forth
from
the
bosom
of
the
deep
there
rose
a
wondrous
chain
of
towering
cliffs
clear
as
the
lake
upon
whose
mirror
sleep
all
tenderly
the
skiffs
while
rays
of
light
played
their
polished
sides
as
slowly
rose
and
sank
they
on
the
tides
kissed
by
the
sun
they
grew
their
colors
sheen
of
rose
and
tips
between
the
amethyst
deepened
to
a
royal
tone
of
purple
and
i
stood
and
gazed
alone
i
knew
that
naught
of
earth
was
left
save
me
to
look
upon
that
strange
and
glorious
sea
and
as
i
gazed
wild
flames
leapt
up
to
seize
the
iceberg
glow
and
melt
it
to
their
will
naught
could
their
hungry
rage
of
greed
appease
while
luridly
and
sullen
burned
they
still
what
then
does
it
portray
this
onslaught
fierce
of
flames
upon
these
sunlit
cliffs
of
ice
if
it
be
not
that
evil
seeks
to
pierce
the
armor
thrown
about
the
soul
device
the
powers
that
wage
unceasing
war
and
ever
seek
to
gain
what
lies
afar
above
them
souls
of
just
men
perfect
made
yield
not
i
cried
for
here
a
mortal
stands
alone
and
helpless
in
these
alien
lands
and
yet
on
mortal
lips
i
know
is
laid
the
burden
of
a
knowledge
far
above
all
thought
of
human
gain
or
human
love
and
crying
thus
i
woke
nor
ever
knew
if
to
fruition
my
bright
vision
grew
on
empyrean
heights
read
at
hardman
hall
new
york
city
before
the
international
league
of
press
clubs
june
i
stood
on
empyrean
heights
and
saw
outlined
in
figures
bold
a
vision
there
loud
were
the
shouts
of
strife
and
deadly
war
while
peace
remote
shone
in
her
beauty
fair
i
heard
the
clash
of
arms
the
martial
tread
while
nation
warred
with
nation
in
their
lust
of
pride
and
power
until
there
lay
the
dead
the
heroes
of
a
decade
in
the
dust
i
saw
in
ranks
that
spread
to
either
pole
heroic
deeds
of
great
men
and
of
true
the
highest
aspirations
of
the
soul
the
work
wrought
through
the
many
by
the
few
i
sped
from
rising
sun
unto
the
west
i
read
the
stars
that
mirrored
in
the
sky
and
some
in
a
resplendent
light
were
dressed
and
some
through
shadow
i
could
scarce
descry
i
saw
a
nation
rise
and
saw
its
fall
i
learned
a
people
passing
glory
there
i
heard
the
strident
voice
of
justice
call
and
answering
cheer
and
joy
were
in
the
air
i
passed
through
touching
scenes
of
humble
life
where
hearts
were
beating
in
their
full
content
where
far
from
peaceful
hearth
and
home
lay
strife
and
days
of
joy
and
gaiety
were
spent
i
passed
scenes
of
dark
and
dull
despair
on
on
where
bitter
want
and
hunger
raged
where
naught
of
holiness
was
pictured
there
but
man
man
his
cruel
warfare
waged
i
heard
the
wail
of
childhood
in
its
need
and
saw
the
fearful
shadow
of
death
wing
pass
swiftly
on
and
through
the
darkness
speed
and
heard
the
joyous
song
the
angels
sing
i
heard
the
deeds
of
woe
saw
sins
of
ill
i
knew
life
tragedy
was
played
the
while
that
greed
of
gain
that
selfish
restless
will
was
crushing
out
the
tender
youth
sweet
smile
i
also
read
of
good
and
saw
its
scope
of
radiance
on
a
troubled
world
dark
web
and
saw
that
trust
and
love
and
buoyant
hope
outrode
the
tide
ere
it
could
ebb
nay
tell
me
then
whence
came
each
passing
scene
and
why
such
widespread
power
vouchsafed
to
me
that
time
nor
space
held
aught
of
bar
between
the
shifting
lights
of
land
and
distant
sea
how
could
i
realize
the
utmost
span
of
life
and
love
nay
more
of
silent
death
as
meted
out
within
the
time
of
man
and
passing
the
wide
world
pulsing
breath
o
puissant
press
what
need
have
i
to
tell
the
power
of
thy
great
sceptre
wielded
here
when
those
beneath
whose
brilliant
magic
spell
we
sat
entranced
now
in
our
midst
appear
each
face
familiar
warms
the
brother
heart
each
hand
extended
meets
an
earnest
clasp
each
friend
is
here
a
living
sentient
part
of
brotherhood
and
seeks
an
honest
grasp
o
mighty
power
for
good
or
yet
for
ill
for
saving
grace
mayhap
for
withering
blight
thy
brimming
cup
of
service
should
be
still
the
draught
to
lift
a
weary
world
to
light
thy
arm
should
raiséd
be
in
noble
strife
thy
steady
hand
still
wield
the
trenchant
pen
thus
all
of
light
and
grace
and
noble
life
shall
call
thee
forth
from
hearts
of
fellowmen
songs
of
remembrance
a
little
while
march
a
little
while
my
friends
and
i
am
lying
beneath
the
sod
that
tells
us
spring
is
nigh
and
i
who
found
this
life
no
rest
supplying
shall
lay
my
task
aside
without
a
sigh
a
little
while
and
friends
who
kindly
greet
me
shall
seek
my
place
in
tears
shall
seek
in
vain
and
those
whose
love
and
tender
thought
now
meet
me
shall
say
she
comes
our
friend
no
more
again
a
little
while
and
oh
how
great
the
yearning
to
lay
the
burden
down
to
be
as
free
as
bird
that
hails
its
nest
on
wing
returning
so
do
i
think
beloved
of
rest
and
thee
the
rest
my
weary
heart
and
soul
have
waited
through
all
these
years
of
sorrow
and
of
doubt
as
traveller
on
his
homeward
way
belated
impatient
seeks
and
can
not
bide
without
and
thee
oh
loved
one
gone
this
year
before
me
unto
a
world
of
light
and
rapture
pure
the
thought
of
thee
doth
smiling
now
allure
me
to
draw
more
close
and
yet
to
more
endure
reverie
the
long
reach
of
water
comes
the
plash
of
dipping
oar
and
faintly
borne
upon
the
wind
far
voices
gain
the
shore
i
hear
their
low
faint
murmur
as
the
boat
glides
on
its
way
and
with
the
glance
of
flashing
oar
fall
silver
drops
of
spray
i
lie
with
eyes
and
dream
of
days
that
long
are
fled
while
fancy
brings
unto
my
side
the
forms
of
those
now
dead
when
life
and
love
were
as
a
song
from
vibrant
chords
of
youth
when
every
heart
that
greeted
me
spoke
but
of
trust
and
truth
thus
i
hold
commune
with
mine
own
heart
and
ask
were
youth
and
joy
the
greater
gain
or
life
more
finished
task
quick
comes
the
answer
to
my
lips
quick
to
the
question
craved
the
noblest
deeds
of
life
are
those
in
later
years
engraved
on
tablets
of
the
living
mind
in
characters
full
bold
not
happiness
nor
yet
content
can
here
life
measure
hold
not
to
glide
on
in
summer
dreams
nor
yet
to
love
is
best
but
in
thy
noble
strength
to
grow
and
earn
the
rest
so
not
with
envious
eyes
i
watch
the
boat
whose
living
freight
is
youth
and
all
youth
sunny
dreams
i
who
have
learned
to
wait
heimweh
o
heart
of
mine
why
sighest
for
joys
thou
not
taste
o
eyes
why
turn
in
longing
across
the
weary
waste
and
lips
that
falter
sadly
of
home
and
love
and
peace
now
all
thy
vain
repining
and
doubt
and
grief
oh
cease
home
nay
thy
home
is
distant
will
longing
bring
it
near
and
heart
will
thy
complaining
point
out
the
way
more
clear
o
heart
of
mine
thou
sighest
in
vain
thy
home
afar
it
shineth
as
a
beacon
to
exile
as
a
star
unto
the
lonely
sailor
who
dreams
of
land
and
love
but
as
he
dreams
looks
ever
unto
his
star
above
then
heart
bind
to
thy
longing
the
gaze
that
turns
aloft
beyond
the
raging
tempest
to
seek
love
guidance
oft
heimweh
o
homesick
sailor
across
life
stormy
main
return
unto
thy
haven
no
more
to
roam
again
grand
manan
the
wild
reach
of
wave
afar
thy
cliffs
arise
once
more
i
turn
mine
eyes
upon
thy
hills
and
shore
all
silent
in
majestic
state
monarch
of
mighty
realm
thy
front
is
raised
to
meet
the
storm
when
fierce
gales
overwhelm
yet
on
this
lovely
autumn
day
in
soft
enchantment
chain
outlined
on
distant
sky
thy
memory
shall
remain
my
feet
must
tread
in
other
paths
than
this
belovéd
land
and
other
footprints
in
their
turn
shall
press
this
shining
sand
sea
air
and
sky
are
filled
alike
with
beauty
and
delight
the
sea
is
shimmering
at
my
feet
with
all
of
life
and
light
so
let
me
bear
to
other
scenes
this
picture
it
shall
stay
as
memory
and
as
joy
to
me
through
many
a
weary
day
and
oft
shall
rise
before
my
sight
when
distance
time
and
care
have
touched
my
life
with
graver
thought
this
vision
passing
fair
madeleine
i
see
her
passing
through
the
fields
all
fresh
with
daisies
and
with
rye
and
something
purer
brighter
breathes
than
the
mere
tints
of
earth
and
sky
her
dainty
head
with
grace
is
poised
and
her
shade
i
see
the
soft
dark
eyes
the
pure
that
hold
so
much
of
joy
for
me
her
feet
as
loath
to
tread
the
bloom
of
flowers
and
of
bright
fall
lightly
as
she
maketh
way
to
pass
nor
leave
behind
her
blight
fearless
the
eyes
and
full
of
thought
as
though
life
secret
fain
she
know
grace
of
a
wildness
all
untrained
wraps
her
within
its
subtile
glow
and
as
she
treads
her
way
i
know
she
seeks
me
me
alone
o
child
my
heart
grows
weak
to
stifle
now
its
secret
moan
what
will
ye
bring
her
love
and
life
or
what
withhold
i
may
not
see
but
oh
i
pray
ye
take
leave
her
her
grace
and
purity
where
the
shadows
play
where
the
long
reach
of
shadows
play
and
placid
waters
murmur
by
i
dream
throughout
the
summer
day
nor
note
the
hours
that
wingéd
fly
hushed
is
the
voice
of
sordid
trade
and
the
birds
sweet
song
is
stilled
while
all
the
cares
that
life
hath
made
slip
from
my
heart
which
now
is
filled
with
peace
alone
o
nature
pure
to
thee
i
turn
no
more
to
stray
in
spirit
with
thee
ever
sure
to
find
sweet
solace
for
the
day
o
leafy
homes
where
rest
o
gentle
breeze
that
rocks
and
sways
my
heart
all
silent
stays
to
rest
and
bide
apart
these
days
for
other
worlds
are
pictured
there
reflected
in
the
waters
lie
and
each
is
clear
and
passing
fair
and
fleecy
clouds
each
glide
by
a
valentine
years
have
sped
by
with
rapid
wing
since
those
bright
days
of
long
ago
when
hand
in
hand
in
life
sweet
spring
we
told
our
love
in
accents
low
for
you
were
young
and
fair
and
free
and
i
a
youth
with
ardor
bold
you
were
of
all
earth
maids
to
me
the
fairest
ah
the
story
old
our
youthful
fancy
in
the
years
that
now
lie
far
behind
anew
springs
forth
from
memories
time
endears
when
smiles
were
frequent
tears
were
few
ah
well
we
parted
still
doth
shine
your
form
on
fancy
pictured
wall
as
when
you
were
my
valentine
and
i
to
you
was
all
in
all
i
see
you
on
the
busy
street
a
comely
matron
fair
of
face
the
maiden
tall
and
pale
and
sweet
keeps
by
your
side
with
even
pace
you
see
her
not
nay
she
is
mine
this
gracious
presence
from
the
past
she
is
my
one
fair
valentine
through
summer
glow
through
winter
blast
the
martins
slowly
sinks
the
sun
the
evening
takes
from
night
a
deeper
tone
birds
on
restless
wing
are
wheeling
with
a
grace
and
strength
their
own
martins
how
your
note
reminds
me
of
the
days
so
long
ago
in
the
time
when
care
or
sorrow
had
touched
me
with
their
woe
back
your
song
this
evening
takes
me
back
within
that
golden
past
and
i
seem
to
see
the
village
and
the
spell
of
yore
is
cast
once
again
about
my
spirit
memory
brings
before
my
view
friends
and
faces
long
since
vanished
sounds
and
scenes
that
once
i
knew
till
the
town
uprises
from
the
mist
in
verdure
drest
borne
as
jewel
in
its
setting
on
the
grand
old
ocean
breast
the
waves
the
bell
sounds
clearly
with
its
call
to
evening
prayer
and
the
martins
wheel
and
circle
now
with
swift
wing
through
the
air
so
i
muse
while
twilight
summons
once
again
the
long
ago
and
its
clustered
memories
fill
my
brooding
heart
and
overflow
youth
and
love
and
hope
aweary
in
these
years
have
grown
and
i
walk
afaint
in
life
rough
pathway
where
erstwhile
my
feet
did
fly
but
i
think
when
azrael
greets
me
i
would
fain
the
hour
were
mine
the
sunset
and
the
even
at
the
summer
day
decline
so
the
martins
through
the
ether
in
their
graceful
flight
should
be
like
the
harbingers
of
freedom
to
the
soul
from
earth
set
free
never
again
leave
me
alone
to
my
sorrow
my
sorrow
leave
me
alone
i
would
mourn
my
dead
never
again
on
the
morrow
he
greet
me
never
again
it
is
said
it
is
said
never
again
shall
i
see
him
approaching
hear
his
clear
voice
ring
over
the
lea
never
again
shall
his
strong
arm
enfold
me
never
again
ah
woe
is
me
never
again
oh
the
weight
of
this
anguish
never
to
see
him
to
hear
him
again
only
my
heart
to
my
heart
can
disclose
it
never
ah
never
this
quivering
pain
never
again
will
he
wait
my
window
bidding
me
join
him
as
loving
he
stands
never
to
watch
for
his
coming
to
meet
me
over
the
sea
from
those
distant
lands
dark
are
his
eyes
as
is
the
veiled
splendor
of
tropical
skies
in
storm
overcast
glorious
his
smile
as
the
sunlight
descending
full
on
the
earth
when
that
tempest
is
past
now
in
the
land
of
his
birth
though
he
wander
southern
palms
tho
his
footsteps
rove
ever
i
know
in
its
pain
and
its
longing
turns
his
heart
trust
unto
mine
deathless
love
leave
me
alone
to
my
sorrow
my
sorrow
leave
me
alone
with
life
dreary
refrain
never
again
shall
i
hear
his
fond
pleading
listening
i
hear
only
never
again
we
are
severed
by
more
than
the
ocean
vast
billows
we
must
walk
in
our
paths
each
alone
and
in
pain
but
our
hearts
grow
but
closer
and
fonder
and
nearer
though
here
upon
earth
it
be
never
again
hadst
thou
denied
so
many
things
dear
lord
i
asked
so
many
things
that
were
untried
so
many
things
i
sought
but
oh
hadst
thou
denied
hadst
thou
denied
i
did
not
know
their
gold
was
dross
i
did
not
see
the
chasm
wide
but
downward
plunged
and
now
i
cry
hadst
thou
denied
hadst
thou
denied
so
many
things
with
outstretched
hands
i
begged
might
not
be
turned
aside
i
know
the
best
had
oft
been
mine
hadst
thou
denied
hadst
thou
denied
i
wearied
thee
with
my
wild
prayers
to
taste
of
joys
that
abide
while
many
blessings
had
been
mine
hadst
thou
denied
hadst
thou
denied
hadst
thou
denied
my
foolish
wish
hadst
thou
my
spirit
longer
tried
all
these
vain
years
in
grief
i
own
had
reaped
rich
gain
hadst
thou
denied
why
should
i
remember
if
you
forget
why
should
i
remember
the
days
of
long
ago
days
we
spent
together
beside
the
river
flow
why
should
i
remember
the
dreams
that
haunt
me
yet
ah
why
should
i
remember
if
you
forget
why
should
i
remember
the
nights
i
sat
and
dreamed
as
stars
came
out
in
heaven
when
they
and
i
it
seemed
alone
kept
watch
and
vigil
ah
i
recall
them
yet
but
why
should
i
remember
if
you
forget
why
should
i
remember
those
days
of
summer
time
when
love
immortal
bound
me
and
sang
his
witching
rhyme
why
should
i
remember
your
vows
as
there
we
met
ah
why
should
i
remember
if
you
forget
why
should
i
remember
the
grave
i
fashioned
wide
within
my
heart
and
laid
you
and
all
that
with
you
died
why
should
i
bewail
you
and
why
should
it
be
yet
that
i
must
still
remember
and
you
forget
why
has
my
heart
grown
empty
and
why
this
empty
throne
where
you
who
made
life
dear
have
left
me
now
alone
why
can
i
not
a
watch
against
your
set
ah
why
should
i
remember
when
you
forget
to
dear
heart
sweet
heart
that
through
these
years
hast
walked
with
me
in
sun
in
shade
though
thy
dear
presence
bides
with
me
in
thought
alone
that
shall
fade
we
may
not
wander
hand
in
hand
we
seldom
greet
us
face
to
face
yet
in
my
life
thy
love
thy
words
have
ever
yet
a
hallowed
place
together
in
the
past
we
roamed
when
girlhood
fancies
bound
our
will
no
less
we
deem
it
sweet
the
tie
that
holds
us
captive
still
to
thee
beloved
my
heart
turns
now
as
then
for
word
of
cheer
in
those
far
days
my
arm
was
strong
my
love
did
hold
thee
from
all
fear
but
now
my
strength
is
well
nigh
spent
though
crowns
each
happy
hour
and
fain
would
forms
now
vanished
seek
and
fain
recall
that
witching
power
some
sleep
in
death
whom
we
called
dear
some
roam
afar
in
distant
lands
while
you
and
i
have
ever
grown
the
nearer
knit
by
friendship
bands
and
as
the
years
roll
on
i
cling
dear
heart
more
closely
to
thy
love
god
grant
for
all
life
bitterness
a
lasting
peace
to
come
above
songs
of
consolation
and
they
shall
rise
again
and
they
shall
rise
again
oh
words
of
comfort
given
to
many
hearts
by
sorrow
borne
unto
the
earth
and
they
shall
rise
again
the
gates
of
death
are
riven
and
forth
immortal
steps
the
soul
unto
her
birth
long
had
they
lain
in
vast
nepenthe
hidden
coffers
the
germs
of
life
that
silent
waited
but
the
call
of
love
divine
to
seize
upon
the
gift
it
proffers
and
to
throw
back
and
off
forever
the
dark
pall
and
they
shall
rise
again
arise
to
glories
bounding
no
vision
and
no
span
of
fleeting
days
but
born
of
depths
which
life
thus
far
had
been
but
sounding
the
heirs
of
heaven
crown
and
its
immortal
praise
and
they
shall
rise
again
oh
joys
of
hope
eternal
that
though
we
weeping
lay
them
the
heavy
sod
god
angels
guarding
now
behold
their
spring
supernal
and
hold
them
trusting
waiting
but
the
call
of
god
so
shall
this
easter
morn
bring
to
us
waiting
his
word
fulfilled
his
gift
of
gifts
above
all
price
for
earth
and
light
and
air
are
all
to
us
relating
the
glories
borne
at
dawn
from
shores
of
paradise
mine
onward
path
and
so
i
take
mine
onward
path
alone
and
yet
not
quite
alone
if
god
decree
the
way
my
lord
hath
trod
shall
be
mine
own
and
so
my
strength
shall
be
what
though
it
lead
through
tangled
brake
and
brier
and
sharpest
stones
shall
pierce
my
wounded
feet
unto
that
height
if
my
faint
soul
aspire
these
words
mine
ear
might
greet
if
thou
but
follow
me
through
toil
and
pain
if
thou
but
take
thy
cross
and
follow
me
i
will
reward
thee
when
i
come
again
for
all
eternity
but
if
thou
wilt
not
bear
thy
cross
with
me
thou
canst
not
hope
to
win
the
victor
prize
no
martyr
crown
no
saint
green
palm
shall
be
thy
share
in
paradise
and
so
i
fain
would
take
mine
onward
way
in
humble
imitation
of
my
lord
this
hope
to
be
bear
me
in
it
day
by
day
his
word
after
many
days
calm
seas
upon
whose
placid
breast
my
barque
one
day
shall
anchored
lie
beyond
this
season
keen
unrest
beneath
a
softened
evening
sky
i
shall
not
in
those
hours
of
peace
recount
the
storms
that
strike
me
now
for
me
the
struggle
sore
shall
cease
and
trust
stand
at
my
vessel
prow
the
shipwreck
and
the
storm
no
more
may
toss
me
its
stern
decree
but
anchored
within
sight
of
shore
a
perfect
rest
shall
welcome
me
i
shall
not
count
the
tears
that
flow
these
weary
hours
these
restless
days
for
then
my
keener
sight
shall
know
the
hidden
meaning
of
his
ways
and
thus
i
look
beyond
the
storm
beyond
the
clouds
that
now
appear
knowing
the
ills
that
take
such
form
shall
flee
before
the
evening
clear
calm
seas
upon
whose
placid
breast
my
barque
one
day
shall
anchored
lie
my
soul
may
not
possess
thy
rest
until
the
evening
draweth
nigh
some
day
some
day
when
all
this
weary
time
no
more
hath
power
to
stay
my
flight
when
far
from
earth
unhappy
clime
my
soul
shall
speed
her
way
to
light
i
shall
no
more
this
garb
of
clay
beneath
whose
weight
i
sink
opprest
bear
with
me
but
oh
blesséd
day
find
all
denied
in
life
of
rest
some
day
ah
how
my
heart
doth
cry
with
longing
and
with
pain
aloud
for
some
faint
sign
lest
hope
should
die
for
some
small
token
through
the
cloud
lest
joy
no
more
my
guest
should
be
and
peace
that
calms
with
tender
touch
no
more
should
come
to
visit
me
who
need
their
presence
here
so
much
some
day
nay
do
i
not
know
well
this
life
bears
little
in
its
hand
that
we
should
lie
as
in
a
spell
beneath
its
strong
and
cruel
band
at
best
is
but
a
span
dealt
out
to
each
as
grains
of
sand
may
seem
that
as
the
tempest
whirls
about
are
gone
and
ended
as
a
dream
lake
winnepeseogee
twilight
o
fair
broad
lake
upon
whose
breast
the
shifting
shadows
rise
and
fall
thy
surging
waters
vague
unrest
sinks
beneath
twilight
gathering
pall
thy
changing
beauties
quickly
glide
successive
past
th
entrancéd
eye
while
hills
around
in
regal
pride
reflected
in
thy
waters
lie
i
hear
the
plash
of
dipping
oar
i
see
the
boats
swing
on
their
way
the
waves
flow
on
from
shore
to
shore
while
softly
slowly
dies
the
day
and
sweetly
with
the
evening
calm
upon
my
heart
there
falls
a
peace
that
comes
as
comes
the
evening
psalm
that
bids
the
world
vain
tumult
cease
and
as
fall
swift
the
shades
of
night
along
the
path
my
feet
must
tread
lo
through
the
clouds
a
golden
light
upon
life
passing
scene
is
shed
and
so
bathed
in
its
softened
glow
and
tuned
to
sweetest
harmonies
far
far
beyond
life
ebb
and
flow
the
soul
immortal
seeks
the
skies
jesus
of
nazareth
passeth
by
o
soul
in
thine
hour
of
need
turn
to
the
light
ere
the
moments
fly
turn
unto
one
who
will
ever
heed
jesus
of
nazareth
passeth
by
hark
what
mean
these
songs
of
praise
and
clouds
of
incense
that
float
on
high
see
borne
on
wings
on
this
day
of
days
jesus
of
nazareth
passeth
by
if
thou
but
touch
his
garment
hem
as
they
did
of
old
if
thou
wouldst
not
die
lo
from
his
person
as
unto
them
healing
and
love
flow
silently
into
each
heart
he
entereth
now
listeneth
unto
each
sinner
cry
then
leaving
his
blessing
upon
each
brow
jesus
of
nazareth
passeth
by
joy
that
we
sat
at
his
blesséd
feet
joy
that
he
hears
the
faintest
sigh
loudly
our
lips
exultant
repeat
jesus
of
nazareth
passeth
by
nearer
my
rest
nearer
my
rest
with
each
succeeding
day
that
bears
me
still
mine
own
allotted
task
nearer
my
rest
the
clouds
roll
swift
away
and
nought
remains
o
lord
for
me
to
ask
if
i
but
bear
unflinchingly
life
pain
and
humbly
lay
it
at
thy
feet
divine
then
shall
i
see
each
loss
a
hidden
gain
and
thy
sweet
mercy
through
the
darkness
shine
nearer
my
rest
and
as
i
journey
on
grant
me
dear
lord
my
to
be
to
keep
and
help
me
ere
that
rest
be
won
patience
and
faith
and
blesséd
purity
these
guides
i
pray
thee
each
thine
attribute
and
thou
o
lord
my
shield
and
armor
bright
for
without
thee
no
tree
shall
bear
good
fruit
these
three
o
lord
to
lead
me
through
the
night
so
many
years
these
hands
have
labored
lord
so
many
years
so
many
years
these
feet
have
trod
this
road
so
many
years
these
shoulders
bent
and
weak
have
borne
their
own
and
others
heavy
load
this
heart
has
broken
in
these
many
years
and
tears
have
dimmed
these
eyes
till
life
has
seemed
but
one
sad
wilderness
and
few
the
hours
of
peace
amidst
the
bitter
strife
must
i
then
lord
toil
on
unceasing
here
hast
thou
no
words
of
comfort
for
my
soul
are
all
the
cheerless
fainting
hours
to
win
no
progress
toward
my
weary
spirit
goal
nay
as
i
speak
i
know
the
day
will
dawn
from
out
the
dark
and
night
when
i
released
shall
stand
erect
and
free
within
the
glory
of
that
radiant
light
no
more
then
heart
bewail
these
hours
of
earth
no
more
shed
tears
of
blood
for
surely
there
beyond
the
darkness
and
the
pain
and
gloom
shines
forth
the
sun
in
lands
that
are
most
fair
sorrow
i
wore
a
jewel
on
my
breast
nor
knew
till
late
that
it
was
such
oft
hath
it
robbed
me
of
my
rest
oft
have
i
shivered
at
its
touch
i
wore
it
trembling
and
i
knew
nor
why
it
was
in
fact
nor
how
its
presence
fell
like
evening
dew
on
shrinking
heart
and
lip
and
brow
it
was
a
thing
of
pain
and
yet
a
subtile
blessing
seemed
to
flow
from
its
touch
though
eyes
were
wet
as
from
the
stab
of
ruthless
foe
not
until
years
had
fled
did
i
behold
the
inner
presence
there
not
until
time
had
passed
all
by
did
i
perceive
its
beauty
rare
but
now
i
know
thee
as
thou
art
o
face
divine
that
lookest
down
upon
my
life
and
bruiséd
heart
and
fear
of
thee
hath
flown
thou
shalt
walk
with
me
as
i
know
for
the
brief
space
of
years
to
be
a
newer
higher
path
to
show
where
sorrow
wins
me
purity
unknown
a
day
whose
wondrous
dawn
is
writ
in
letters
firm
and
free
and
bold
through
years
whose
prophecies
shall
fit
this
stone
from
life
mosaic
old
a
day
wherein
my
hands
shall
rest
from
labor
here
the
hands
whose
clasp
on
peace
hath
prest
too
light
to
hold
it
very
near
that
day
whose
number
ofttimes
now
rolls
past
each
year
but
all
unseen
by
eyes
now
holden
shades
the
brow
where
other
shades
have
frequent
been
some
token
in
each
joyous
year
that
most
i
loved
abides
unseen
and
bears
aloft
an
index
clear
upon
its
leaves
now
clasped
between
the
month
the
day
the
hour
is
there
unconscious
to
my
searching
eye
when
be
the
skies
or
dark
or
fair
shall
added
be
the
year
i
die
and
as
i
note
each
feast
of
song
on
earth
each
joy
each
loss
or
birth
shall
i
not
give
nor
thus
be
wrong
a
thought
to
that
when
clogging
earth
shall
hold
me
here
no
more
no
more
shall
dim
with
tears
mine
eyes
when
i
shall
simply
pass
the
door
no
living
hand
impatient
tries
not
mine
to
know
that
day
as
yet
but
in
the
watches
of
the
night
the
watch
my
soul
herself
hath
set
i
wait
the
coming
of
that
light
not
then
as
messenger
of
dread
i
wait
to
read
it
on
the
scroll
not
as
impatient
nor
as
wed
to
life
abides
my
waiting
soul
though
now
inscribed
unknown
it
takes
its
place
on
calendar
of
earth
an
anniversary
that
wakes
to
greet
us
from
the
hour
of
birth
songs
of
patriotism
our
birthright
god
of
the
nations
thou
whose
might
hath
led
us
from
the
dark
to
light
since
first
a
puny
people
we
sought
and
obtained
our
liberty
grant
we
beseech
thee
for
the
earth
a
peace
that
shall
have
noble
birth
a
peace
that
shall
beneath
its
wings
enfold
the
brightest
best
of
things
keep
thou
the
people
of
that
land
who
for
their
homes
and
firesides
stand
teach
thou
another
land
to
rest
her
arms
and
bend
her
haughty
crest
bring
thou
within
the
fold
of
right
all
who
are
plagued
with
war
and
blight
and
bring
o
god
in
this
new
year
a
reign
of
love
and
not
of
fear
so
shall
we
keep
thy
word
divine
so
shall
the
land
no
more
repine
and
this
wide
world
oppressed
with
fear
look
onward
to
a
brighter
year
god
of
the
nations
thou
whose
might
hath
led
us
from
the
dark
to
light
grant
us
to
live
that
we
may
be
worthy
our
birthright
liberty
lexington
april
we
name
our
heroes
in
the
hush
that
follows
battle
awful
roar
and
count
the
cost
of
that
great
rush
to
victory
they
deemed
no
more
than
just
the
simple
right
to
shed
their
blood
in
such
a
holy
cause
where
the
unconquered
died
or
bled
we
turn
from
our
safe
ground
and
pause
to
wonder
how
in
days
long
gone
such
power
was
given
to
right
the
wrong
we
deem
them
worthy
of
all
praise
the
heroes
of
that
battlefield
and
looking
backward
to
those
days
that
meed
of
praise
most
gladly
yield
were
they
more
true
to
dictates
bold
of
honor
in
that
olden
time
or
when
the
weight
of
proof
is
told
rang
out
the
truth
in
purer
chime
gave
they
more
freely
of
life
stream
than
we
would
do
than
we
dare
dream
they
did
not
flinch
when
in
the
wage
of
war
stern
duty
standard
waved
but
heart
and
hand
did
both
engage
and
on
each
soul
was
deep
engraved
country
and
home
fit
words
to
urge
to
action
more
heroic
still
as
that
mighty
ocean
surge
rang
out
the
watchward
of
their
will
as
onward
pressed
to
liberty
the
men
through
whom
we
now
are
free
in
conflict
rang
their
cry
of
might
ours
is
the
cause
that
must
be
won
god
is
the
helper
of
the
right
so
sped
the
word
at
lexington
while
hurrying
from
peaceful
plow
to
war
field
they
came
not
theirs
tyranny
to
bow
not
theirs
a
country
death
and
shame
but
to
go
on
to
greater
height
with
wings
outspread
for
purer
flight
hail

in
our

we
bring
ye
wreathes

ours
to
loose
what
here
but
binds
and
holds
us
from
the
object
sought
then
may
we
hope
in
time
to
stand
as
staunch
and
true
as
that
brave
band
as
meet
we
hold
this
page
of
history
before
the

while
overhead
undimmed
by

not

in

now
hold
proud
communion
with
the

a
glory
undying
that
sheds
its
soft

over
each
scene
outspread
and
tyranny
hand
all
in
vain
is
defying
the
peace
that
to

is

we
feel
the
glad
throb
of
the
patriot
devotion
that
to
the
stars
and
the

must
be
due
all
else
is
engulfed
in
emotion
that
finds
its
fulfillment
the
red

our

dedicated
to
the
children
of
america
fling
to
the

our
noble

never
lag
its

pale
give
it
to

the

children
is
a

most
precious
in
its
worth
no

his

eyes
need
lift
to
curse
his
wretched
birth
no
deed
to
bring
the
blush
of
shame
should
flaunt
beneath
its
folds
but
ever
brighter
grow
the
fame
of
work
its
plan
unfolds
look
to
it
children
let
it
be
as
fair
as
when
the
founders
of
our
liberty
stood
forth
god
noblemen
when
by
the
price
of
blood
and
tears
they
sealed
that
sacred
deed
and
cast
aside
all
doubts
and
fears
to
meet
a

then
let
it
float
to

beneath
the

the

in

never

pale
in
time
of

how
fair
to
see
sent
forth
by
patriot
hand
this
symbol
of
sweet
liberty
throughout
our
native
land
the
national
flower
the
golden
rod
it
grows
tangled
underwood
all
brilliant
in
the
fields
and
our
hearts
a
subtile
spell
its
golden
beauty
wields
perchance
some
exile
foot
hath
pressed
the
road
with
weary
tread
when
lo
from
out
the
wayside
growth
it
rears
its
bonny
head
not
with
the
first
faint
tints
of
spring
are
its
bright
blossoms
seen
but
radiant
in
its
garb
and
decked
with
autumn
fruitful
sheen
then
hail
bright
floweret
of
our
choice
with
multiform
design
though
many
in
thy
blossom
wealth
still
one

in

arlington
may
roll
muffled
drums
upon

furl

for
this

hallowed
ground
we
tread
and
here
we
learn
death
might
our
heroes
whose
last
rest
is
now
within
this
silent
spot
in
lowly
tents
their
bivouac
find
though
not
by
us
forgot
wail
forth
oh
music
in
soft
strains
and
learn
oh
soul
of
man
as
down
the
leafy
aisles
it
throbs
how
brief
on
earth
the
span
of
life
and
turn
from
its
rude
clash
and
all
its
weary
pain
to
muse
awhile
on
heroes
gone
and
hear
their
praise
again
as
words
of
orator
now
fall
upon
the
listening
ear
life
grows
less
close
and
death
is
robbed
of
much
of
doubt
and
fear
for
as
the
burning
words
go
forth
upon
the
balmy
wind
men
thoughts
are
swayed
by
tones
that
sing
the
glory
of
mankind
then
muffled
drums
roll
on
and
flags
your
brilliant
colors
furl
for
here
the
dead
sleep
on
and
here
no
more
may
warfare
hurl
its
blighting
torch
its
screaming
shell
its
horror
and
its
dread
hark
on
the
summer
wind
is
born
a
requiem
for
the
dead
the
dead
musician
julius
eichberg
hushed
is
the
magic
of
his
touch
that
waked
the
soul
to
joyous
praise
the
vibrant
strain
we
loved
so
much
still
echoes
on
throughout
the
days
days
that
had
sped
in
steady
round
thrilled
by
the
songs
his
bow
had
bound
stilled
is
the
music
to
our
ears
in
higher
cycles
we
believe
brighter
than
earthly
crown
appears
his
genius
and
shall
meed
receive
while
in
a
rarer
fuller
light
his
touch
still
wakens
to
delight
then
is
he
not
as
one
who
dies
and
whose
brief
day
is
ended
here
for
in
those
worlds
which
time
defies
his
melody
grows
still
more
clear
then
is
he
not
as
one
whose
light
is
darkened
by
death
envious
night
thus
while
we
wear
within
our
thought
the
beauty
of
his
art
that
here
in
eager
longing
sought
to
voice
the
music
in
his
heart
o
bear
in
mind
no
truth
divine
of
art
is
lost
it
needs
must
shine
across
the

of
shipwrecked

below
its

steadfast
strives
to
sing
its
measure
stately
flow
for
life
is
art
as
art
is
life
and
soars
above
unequal
strife
he
gave
to
man
the
measure
free
the
gods
had
given
to
his
soul
and
touched
to
deeper
ecstasy
bound
music
to
his
sweet
control
o
artist
true
we
deem
thy
death
but
entrance
into
fuller
breath
but
fuller
grasp
of
thy
great
work
but
deeper
draughts
from
wells
divine
where
disappointment
may
lurk
where
round
thy
head
the
glories
shine
which
