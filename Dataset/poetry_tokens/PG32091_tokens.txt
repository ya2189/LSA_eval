the

in
that
unimagined
country
my
spirit
had
wandered
far
from
its
weary
body
in
slumber
where
its
home
and
are
a
air
and
of
light
all
abundance
and
there
a
river
clear
painting
the
scene
like
a
picture
on
its
bosom
green
foliage
drifting
near
no
sign
of
life
i
saw
as
i
pressed
onward
fish
nor
beast
nor
bird
till
i
came
to
a
hill
clothed
in
flowers
to
its
summit
then
shrill
small
voices
i
heard
and
i
saw
from
concealment
a
company
of
with
faces
strangely
fair
talking
their
unearthly
scattered
talk
together
a
bind
of
in
their
hair
marvellously
gentle
feater
far
than
children
in
gesture
mien
and
speech
hastening
onward
in
translucent
shafts
of
sunshine
and
gossiping
each
with
each
their
locks
on
neck
and
shoulder
falling
faint
of
almond
the
silks
they
wore
spun
not
of
worm
but
as
if
inwoven
of
moonbeams
and
foam
on
shore
like
grasshoppers
in
meadows
amalillios
of
the
day
hungrily
gazed
upon
by
me
a
stranger
in
unknown
regions
astray
yet
happy
beyond
words
i
marked
their
sunlit
faces
stealing
soft
enchantment
from
their
eyes
tears
in
my
own
confusing
their
small
image
harkening
their
cries
they
passed
me
unseeing
a
waft
of
flocking
linnets
sadly
i
fared
on
my
way
and
came
in
my
dream
to
a
dreamlike
habitation
festooned
and
grey
pausing
i
gazed
at
the
porch
worn
the
stone
steps
thereto
mute
hung
its
bell
whence
a
stony
head
looked
downward
grey
the
sky
strange
to
me
strange
the
horn
hark
is
that
a
horn
i
hear
in
cloudland
winding
sweet
and
clash
of
and
light
feet
is
it
the
elfin
laughter
of
fairies
riding
faint
and
high
beneath
the
branches
of
the
moon
straying
through
the
starry
sky

was

daybreak
gold

wild
while
past
ann
grey
tower
they
shuffled
three
beggars
spied
a
in
crimson
mantle
muffled
the
daybreak
lighted
up
her
face
all
pink
and
sharp
and
she
looked
on
them
a
little
space
and
shrill
as
hautboy
cried
o
three
tall
footsore
men
of
rags
which
walking
this
gold
morn
i
see
what
will
ye
give
me
from
your
bags
for
fairy
kisses
three
the
first
that
was
a
reddish
man
out

his
bundle

a
crust

angel

must
go

changeling

beneath

finger
the
magic
all
ran
through

of

a
peacock
pie
instead
of
bone
sweet
venison
instead
of
groat
a
white
lily
with
seven
blooms
thereon
and
each
fair
cup
was
deep
with
wine
such
was
the
changeling
charity
the
sweet
feast

enough

nine

not
too
much

three

daybreak
gold

beggar
man
drank
deep
unto
the
fairy
child

blessed

good

the
nook

a
pool
freshed

colours

green
bands

grasshoppers
their
feet

their
tiny

as
i
lay
awake
in
the

i
heard
a
faint
singing
in
the
wood
out
of
bed
sleepyhead
put
your
white
foot
now
here
are
we
beneath
the
tree
singing
round
the
root
now
i
looked
out
of
window
in
the
white
moonlight
the
leaves
were
like
snow
in
the
wood
come
away
child
and
play

with
the
gnomies
in
a
mound
green
and
round
that
where
their
home
is
honey
sweet
curds
to
eat
cream
and
frumenty
shells
and
beads
poppy
seeds
you
shall
have
plenty
but
as
soon
as
i
stooped
in
the
dim
moonlight
to
put
on
my
stocking
and
my
shoe
the
sweet
shrill
singing
echoed
faintly
away
and
the
grey
of
the
morning
peeped
through
and
instead
of
the
gnomies
there
came
a
red
robin
to
sing
of
the
buttercups
and
dew
sam
three

little
whirligig
illustration
i
thinking
and
thinking
said
old
sam
shore
somebody
i
heard
at
the
door
from
the
clock
popped
the
cuckoo
and
cuckooed
out
eight
as
there
in
his
chair
he
wondering
sate
there
no
one
i
knows
on
would
come
so
late
the
latch
of
an
empty
house
with
nobbut
inside
but
me
and
a
mouse
maybe
in
sleep
i
be
and
out
of
a
dream
came
that
tapping
to
me
at
length
he
cautiously
rose
and
went
and
with
thumb
upon
latch
awhile
listening
bent
then
slowly
drew
open
the
door
and
behold
there
stood
a
fairy
all
green
and
gold
mantled
up
warm
against
dark
and
cold
and
smiling
up
into
his
candle
shine
lips
like
wax
and
cheeks
like
wine
as
saucy
and
winsome
a
thing
to
see
as
are
linden
buds
on
a
linden
tree
in
the
doorway
stood
simple
sam
his
head
with
to
dame
fairy
she
nods
and
cries
clear
and
sweet
is
a
sir
when
such
folks
meet
i
know
thee
sam
thou
though
wist
not
of
me
and
i
come
in
late
gloaming
to
speak
with
thee
though
my
eyes
do
dazzle
at
glint
of
your
rush
all
under
this
pretty
green
fuchsia
bush
sam
ducked
once
more
smiling
simple
and
slow
like
the
warbling
of
birds
her
words
did
flow
and
she
laughed
very
merry
to
see
how
true
shone
the
old
man
kindness
his
courtesy
through
and
she
nodded
her
head
and
the
stars
on
high
sparkled
down
on
her
smallness
from
out
of
the
sky
a
friend
is
a
friend
sam
and
wonderful
pleasant
and
i
come
for
old
sake
sake
to
bring
thee
a
present
three
wishes
three
wishes
are
thine
sam
shore
just
three
wishes
and
wish
no
more
all
for
because
to
see
the
burn
in
yon
hawthorn
tree
and
your
old
milch
cow
wheresoever
she
goes
never
crops
over
the
ay
sam
thou
art
old
and
thy
house
is
lone
but
there
potencies
round
thee
and
here
is
one
poor
sam
he
stared
and
the
star
a
shimmering
light
on
the
shed
like
rilling
of
water
her
voice
rang
sweet
and
the
sighed
at
the
sound
of
it
he
frowned
glanced
back
at
the
empty
grate
and
shook
very
slowly
his
grey
old
pate
three
wishes
my
dear
why
i
scarcely
knows
which
be
my
crany
and
which
my
toes
but
i
thank
kindly
and
this
i
say
that
the
night
of
your
passing
is
michaelmas
day
and
if
it
were
company
come
on
a
sudden
why
i
ax
for
a
fat
goose
to
fry
in
the
oven
and
lo
and
forsooth
as
the
words
he
was
uttering
a
rich
puff
of
air
set
his
candle
and
there
rose
in
the
kitchen
a
sizzling
and
sputtering
with
a
crackling
of
sparks
and
of
flames
a
great
fluttering
and
of
which
here
could
not
be
two
opinions
a
savour
of
sage
and
onions
beam
wall
and
flagstones
the
kitchen
was
lit
every
dark
corner
and
cranny
of
it
with
the
blaze
from
the
hearthstone
copper
and
brass
winked
back
the
winking
of
platter
and
glass
and
a
wonderful
squeaking
of
mice
went
up
at
the
smell
of
a
michaelmas
supper
to
sup
unctuous
odours
that
wreathed
and
swirled
frisked
a
whisker
or
twirled
while
out
of
the
chimney
up
into
the
night
that
smoke
took
flight
that
one
says
the
fairy
finger
on
thumb
so
now
mister
sam
there
but
two
to
come
she
leaned
her
head
sidelong
she
lifted
her
chin
with
a
twinkling
of
eye
from
the
radiance
within
poor
sam
stood
astounded
he
says
says
he
i
my
old
mother
was
back
with
me
for
if
there
was
one
thing
she
could
refuse
was
a
sweet
thick
slice
from
the
breast
of
a
goose
but
his
cheek
grew
stiff
and
his
eyes
stared
bright
for
there
on
her
stick
pushing
out
of
the
night
along
herself
and
no
other
came
who
but
the
shape
of
his
dear
old
mother
straight
into
the
kitchen
she
hastened
and
went
her
breath
coming
quick
as
if
all
but
spent
why
sam
says
she
the
bird
be
turning
for
my
nose
tells
i
that
the
skin
and
down
at
the
oven
the
ghost
of
her
sat
and
basted
the
goose
with
the
boiling
fat
oho
cries
the
fairy
sweet
and
small
another
wish
gone
will
leave
nothing
at
all
and
sam
sighs
bless
keep
the
other
there
nowt
that
i
want
now
i
have
my
mother
but
the
fairy
laughs
softly
and
says
says
she
there
one
wish
left
sam
i
promised
three
hasten
your
wits
the
hour
creeps
on
there
calling
afield
and
i
soon
to
be
gone
soon
as
haps
midnight
the
cocks
will
crow
and
me
to
the
gathering
and
feasting
must
go
sam
gazed
at
his
mother
withered
and
wan
the
rose
in
her
cheek
her
bright
hair
gone
and
her
poor
old
back
bent
double
with
years
and
he
scarce
could
speak
for
the
salt
salt
tears
well
well
he
says
i
unspeakable
glad
but
it
bai
quite
the
same
as
when
i
was
a
lad
there
joy
and
there
joy
but
to
tell
the
truth
there
none
can
compare
with
the
joy
of
one
youth
and
if
it
was
possible
how
could
i
choose
but
be
back
in
boy
breeches
to
eat
the
goose
and
all
the
old
things
and
my
mother
the
most
to
shine
again
real
as
my
own
gatepost
what
would
i
give
too
to
see
again
wag
the
dumpity
tail
of
my
old
dog
shag
your
kindness
but
all
wishing
was
vain
unless
us
can
both
be
young
again
a
shrill
faint
laughter
from
nowhere
came
empty
the
dark
in
the
and
there
stood
our
sam
about
four
foot
high
snub
nose
shock
hair
and
round
blue
eye
breeches
and
braces
and
coat

were
made
just
as
happy
as
happy
can
be
and
there
with
a
bumpity
tail
to
wag
sat
laughing
with
tongue
out
their
old
dog
shag
to
clatter
of
patter
bones
giblets
and
juice
between
them
they
ate
up
the
whole
of
the

but
time
is
a
river
for
ever
in

the
weeks
went
by
as
the
weeks
must
go
soon
to

grow
the
long
years
passed
one
after
another
making
older
and
older
our
sam
and
his
mother
and
alas
and
alack
with
nine
of
them
gone
poor
shag
lay
asleep
again
under
a
stone
and
a
sorrowful
dread
would
sometimes
creep
into
sam
dreams
as
he
lay
asleep
that
his
mother
was
lost
and
away
he
fare
calling
her
calling
her
everywhere
in
dark
in
rain
by
roads
unknown
under
echoing
hills
and
alone
alone
what
bliss
in
the
morning
to
wake
and
see
the
sun
shining
green
in
the
linden
tree
and
out
of
that
dream
dark
shadowiness
to
slip
in
on
his
mother
and
give
her
a
kiss
and
go
whistling
off
in
the
dew
to
hear
the
thrushes
all
mocking
him
sweet
and
clear
still
moon
after
moon
from
heaven
above
shone
on
mother
and
son
and
made
light
of
love
her
roses
faded
her
pretty
brown
hair
had
sorrowful
grey
in
it
everywhere
and
at
last
she
died
and
was
laid
to
rest
her
tired
hands
crossed
on
her
shrunken
breast
and
sam
now
lonely
lived
on
and
on
till
most
of
his
workaday
life
seemed
gone
yet
spring
came
again
with
its
green
and
blue
and
presently
summer
wild
roses
too
pinks
sweet
william
and
blackberry
lavender
eglantine
and
when
these
had
blossomed
and
gone
their
way
was
apples
and
daisies
and
michaelmas
day
yes
dew
and
haws
in
the
may
and
seraphs
singing
in
michaelmas
day
sam
worked
all
morning
and
get
rest
for
a
kind
of
a
feeling
of
grief
in
his
breast
and
yet
not
grief
but
something
more
like
the
thought
that
what
happens
has
happened
before
he
fed
the
chickens
he
fed
the
sow
on
a
stool
sate
down
to
the
cow
with
a
pail
his
legs
in
the
green
in
the
meadow
under
the
elm
trees
lengthening
shadow
and
woke
at
last
with
a
smile
and
a
sigh
to
find
he
had
milked
his
poor
jingo
dry
as
dusk
set
in
even
the
birds
did
seem
to
be
calling
and
calling
from
out
of
a
dream
he
chopped
up
kindling
shut
up
his
shed
in
a
bucket
of
soused
his
head
to
freshen
his
eyes
up
a
little
and
make
the
drowsy
old
wits
of
him
wider
awake
as
neat
as
a
womanless
creature
is
able
he
swept
up
his
hearthstone
and
laid
the
table
and
then
his
platter
and
mug
if
you
please
sate
gloomily
gooming
at
loaf
and
cheese
gooming
and
gooming
as
if
the
mere
sight
of
his
victuals
could
satisfy
appetite
and
the
longer
and
longer
he
looked
at
them
the
slimmer
slimmed
upward
his
candle
flame
blue
in
the
air
and
when
squeaked
a
mouse
was
loud
as
a
trump
in
the
hush
of
the
house
then
sudden
a
soft
little
wind
puffed
by
the
roof
and
the
sky
and
died
and
then
that
deep
dead
wonderful
silence
again
then
soft
as
a
rattle
her
seeds
in
the
midst
of
a
tangle
of
weeds
came
a
faint
faint
knocking
a
rustle
like
silk
and
a
breath
at
the
keyhole
as
soft
as
milk
still
as
the
flit
of
a
moth
and
then
that
infinitesimal
knocking
again
sam
lifted
his
chin
from
his
fists
he
listened
his
wandering
eyes
in
the
candle
glistened
then
slowly
slowly
rolled
round
by
degrees
and
there
sat
a
mouse
on
the
top
of
his
cheese
he
stared
at
this
midget
and
it
at
him
over
the
edge
of
his
mug
round
rim
and
as
if
it
were
christian
he
says
did
hear
a
faint
little

as
up

fly
i
saw
three

that
mocked
the

sparrows
they
carried
in

till
a
hawk
from
his
eyrie
swooped
down
like
an
arrow
smote
on
the
cages
and
ended
their
song
i
saw
three
witches
that
sailed
in
a
shallop
all
turning
their
heads
with
a
snickering
smile
till
a
bank
of
green
osiers
concealed
their
grim
faces
though
i
heard
them
lamenting
for
many
a
mile
i
saw
three
witches
asleep
in
a
valley
their
heads
in
a
row
like
stones
in
a
flood
till
the
moon
creeping
upward
looked
white
through
the

turned
them
to

three

there
were

their

lay
thick
on

for

beamed
a

of

there
were
three
wooden
stools
for
whatever
they
wore
on
their
backs
so
each
would
lie
on
a
drowsy
pillow
and
watch
the

in
the

and
hear
the
parrot
scream
to
the

parrots
of

the

cried

too
sleepy

the
journey

witch
who
long
had
lurked
by
the
wayside
looked
out
of
sorcery
lift
up
your
eyes
you
lonely
wanderer
she
peeped
from
her
casement
small
here
shelter
and
quiet
to
give
you
rest
young
man
and
apples
for
thirst
withal
and
he
looked
up
out
of
his
sad
reverie
and
saw
all
the
woods
in
green
with
birds
that
flitted
feathered
in
the
dappling
the
leaves
between
and
he
lifted
up
his
face
towards
her
lattice
and
there
slanting
through
the
silence
of
the
long
past
dwelt
the
still
green
witch
eyes
and
vaguely
from
the
of
memory
voices
seemed
to
cry
what
is
the
darkness
of
one
brief
to
the
deaths
thou
hast
made
us
die
heed
not
the
words
of
the
enchantress
who
would
us
still
betray

sad
with
the
echo
of
their
reproaches
doubting
he
turned
away
i
may
not
shelter
your
roof

nor
in
this
wood
green
shadow
seek
repose
nor
will
your
apples
quench
the
thirst
a
homesick
wanderer
knows
forsooth
she
softly
mocked
him
and
the
beauty
in
her
face
made
in
the
sunshine
pale
and
trembling
a
stillness
in
that
place
and
he
sighed
as
if
in
fear
the
young
wanderer
looking
to
left
and
to
right
where
the
endless
narrow
road
swept
onward
in
the
distance
lost
to
sight
and
there
fell
upon
his
sense
the
briar
haunting
the
air
with
its
breath
and
the
faint
shrill
sweetness
of
the
birds
throats
their
tent
of
leaves
beneath
and
there
was
the
witch
in
no
wise
heeding
her
arbour
and
dish
her
pitcher
of
and
clear
damask
all
that
the
weary
wish
and
the
last
gold
beam
across
the
green
world
faltered
and
failed
as
he
remembered
his
solitude
and
the
dark
inhospitality
and
he
looked
upon
the
witch
with
eyes
of
sorrow
in
the
darkening
of
the
day
and
turned
him
aside
into
oblivion
and
the
voices
died
away
and
the
witch
stepped
down
from
her
casement
in
the
hush
of
night
he
heard
the
calling
and
wailing
in
dewy
thicket
of
bird
to
hidden
bird

gloom
stole
all
her
burning
crimson
remote

it
very

has
been
in

me

stept
she
light
and
heedfully
across
the
frozen
snow
and
plucked
a
bunch
of
that
near
a
pool
did
grow
and
by
and
by
she
comes
to
seven
shadows
in
one
place
stretched
black
by
seven
against
the
sun
bright
face
she
looks
to
left
she
looks
to

and
in
the
midst
she
sees
a
little
pool
of
water
clear
and
frozen
the
trees
then
down
beside
its
margent
in
the
crusty
snow
she
kneels
and
hears
a
magic
belfry
with
sweet
bells

clear
sang
the
faint

merry
peal
then
silence
on

lo
as
lucy
turned
her

and
looked
along

one

nine
they
straight
to

looked
upon

narrowly

lucy
sees
in
clouds
of
gold
green
cherry
trees
and
bushes
of
red
roses
that
bloomed
above
the
snow
she
smells
all
faint
the
blowing
so
wild
and
fair
and
doves
with
milky
eyes
ascend
fluttering
in
the
air
clear
flowers
she
sees
like
tulip
buds
go
floating
by
like
birds
with
wavering
tips
that
warbled
sweetly
strange
enchanted
words
and
as
with
ropes
of
amethyst
the
boughs
with
lamps
were
hung

clusters
of
green
emeralds
like

upon

clung

the

awoke
with
bristling
beard
crouched
listening
in
the
darkness
to
a
sound
that
he
had
heard
he
leaned
upon
his
foursquare
bed
his
thumb
beneath
his
chin
hearkening
after
that
which
had
stirred
the
dream
that
he
was

in

heard
some
keener
stranger
quieter
closer
voice
it
was

woke

silence
like
a
billow
drowned
the
word
he
spoke
his
chamber
walls
were
cloaked
with
dark
shadow
did
thickly
brood
and
in
the
vague
night
a
presence
stood
sudden
a
gigantic
hand
he
thrust
into
his
bosom
cold

now
no
surging
restless
beat
its
long
tale
told
swept
on
him

there

sate
