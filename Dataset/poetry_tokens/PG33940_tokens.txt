as
a
slight
token
of
appreciation
and
esteem
proem
oh
for
a
soul
that
fulfills
music
like
that
of
a
bird
thrilling
with
rapture
the
hills
heedless
if
any
one
heard
or
like
the
flower
that
blooms
lone
in
the
midst
of
the
trees
filling
the
woods
with
perfumes
careless
if
any
one
sees
or
like
the
wandering
wind
over
the
meadows
that
swings
bringing
wild
sweets
to
mankind
knowing
not
that
which
it
brings
oh
for
a
way
to
impart
beauty
no
matter
how
hard
like
unto
nature
whose
art
never
once
dreams
of
reward
a
voice
on
the
wind
a
voice
on
the
wind
she
walks
with
the
wind
on
the
windy
height
when
the
rocks
are
loud
and
the
waves
are
white
and
all
night
long
she
calls
through
the
night
o
my
children
come
home
her
bleak
gown
torn
as
a
tattered
cloud
tosses
around
her
like
a
shroud
while
over
the
deep
her
voice
rings
loud
o
my
children
come
home
come
home
o
my
children
come
home
who
is
she
who
wanders
alone
when
the
wind
drives
sheer
and
the
rain
is
blown
who
walks
all
night
and
makes
her
moan
o
my
children
come
home
whose
face
is
raised
to
the
blinding
gale
whose
hair
blows
black
and
whose
eyes
are
pale
while
over
the
world
is
heard
her
wail
o
my
children
come
home
come
home
o
my
children
come
home
she
walks
with
the
wind
in
the
windy
wood
the
sad
rain
drips
from
her
hair
and
hood
and
her
cry
sobs
by
like
a
ghost
pursued
o
my
children
come
home
where
the
trees
are
gaunt
and
the
rocks
are
drear
the
owl
and
the
fox
crouch
down
in
fear
while
wild
through
the
wood
her
voice
they
hear
o
my
children
come
home
come
home
o
my
children
come
home
who
is
she
who
shudders
by
when
the
boughs
blow
bare
and
the
dead
leaves
fly
who
walks
all
night
with
her
wailing
cry
o
my
children
come
home
who
strange
of
look
and
wild
of
tongue
with
pale
feet
wounded
and
hands
sweeps
on
and
on
with
her
cry
o
my
children
come
home
come
home
o
my
children
come
home
is
the
spirit
of
autumn
no
man
sees
the
mother
of
death
and
mysteries
who
cries
on
the
wind
all
night
to
these
o
my
children
come
home
the
spirit
of
autumn
pierced
with
pain
calling
her
children
home
again
death
and
dreams
through
ruin
and
rain
o
my
children
come
home
come
home
o
my
children
come
home
the
land
of
hearts
made
whole
do
you
know
the
way
that
goes
over
fields
of
rue
and
rose
warm
of
scent
and
hot
of
hue
roofed
with
heaven
bluest
blue
to
the
vale
of
dreams
come
true
do
you
know
the
path
that
twines
banked
with
and
vines
under
boughs
that
shade
a
stream
hurrying
crystal
as
a
gleam
to
the
hills
of
love
tell
me
tell
me
have
you
gone
through
the
fields
and
woods
of
dawn
meadowlands
and
trees
that
roll
great
of
grass
and
huge
of
bole
to
the
land
of
hearts
made
whole
on
the
way
among
the
fields
poppies
lift
vermilion
shields
in
whose
hearts
the
golden
noon
murmuring
her
drowsy
tune
rocks
the
sleepy
bees
that
croon
on
the
way
amid
the
woods
mandrakes
muster
multitudes
whose
blossoms
white
as
tusk
glides
the
glimmering
with
her
fluttering
moths
of
musk
here
you
hear
the
stealthy
stir
of
shy
lives
of
hoof
and
fur
harmless
things
that
hide
and
peer
hearts
that
sucked
the
milk
of
fear
fox
and
rabbit
squirrel
and
deer
here
you
see
the
mossy
flight
of
faint
forms
that
love
the
night
and
whose
far
call
before
you
brings
of
happenings
now
in
sunlight
now
in
shade
water
like
a
brandished
blade
foaming
forward
wild
of
flight
startles
then
arrests
the
sight
whirling
steely
loops
of
light
thro
the
down
the
vale
breezes
pass
and
leave
a
trail
of
cool
music
that
the
birds
following
in
happy
herds
gather
up
in
twittering
words
blossoms
frail
and
manifold
strew
the
way
with
pearl
and
gold
blurs
that
seem
the
darling
print
of
the
springtime
feet
or
glint
of
her
twinkling
gown
torn
tint
there
the
myths
of
old
endure
dreams
that
are
the
cure
things
that
have
no
place
or
play
in
the
facts
of
everyday
your
presence
smile
and
sway
suddenly
your
eyes
may
see
stepping
softly
from
her
tree
slim
of
form
and
wet
with
dew
the
brown
dryad
lips
the
hue
of
a
berry
bit
into
you
may
mark
the
naiad
rise
from
her
pool
reflected
skies
in
her
gaze
the
heaven
that
dreams
starred
in
streams
mixed
with
water
grayer
gleams
you
may
see
the
laurel
girth
big
of
bloom
give
fragrant
birth
to
the
oread
whose
hair
musk
and
darkness
light
and
air
fills
the
hush
with
wonder
there
you
may
mark
the
rocks
divide
and
the
faun
before
you
glide
piping
on
a
magic
reed
sowing
many
a
music
seed
from
which
bloom
and
mushroom
bead
of
the
rain
and
sunlight
born
young
of
beard
and
young
of
horn
you
may
see
the
satyr
lie
with
a
very
knowing
eye
teaching
youngling
birds
to
fly
these
shall
cheer
and
follow
you
through
the
vale
of
dreams
come
true
voices
feet
forms
of
mist
and
hazy
heat
in
whose
pulses
sunbeams
beat
lo
you
tread
enchanted
ground
from
the
hollows
all
around
elf
and
spirit
gnome
and
fay
guide
your
feet
along
the
way
till
the
dewy
close
of
day
then
beside
you
jet
on
jet
or
violet
flickering
swings
a
firefly
light
aye
to
guide
your
steps
from
the
valley
to
the
height
steep
the
way
is
when
at
last
vale
and
wood
and
stream
are
passed
from
the
heights
you
shall
behold
panther
heavens
of
spotted
gold
deeps
unfold
you
shall
see
on
stocks
and
stones
sunset
color
tones
fallen
and
the
valleys
filled
with
dusk
purple
music
spilled
on
the
silence
then
as
answering
bell
greets
bell
night
ring
in
her
miracle
of
the
doméd
dark
note
on
note
with
starlight
cold
the
moon
broad
peal
of
gold
on
the
shows
you
then
her
brings
you
home
and
folds
your
soul
in
the
peace
of
vale
and
knoll
in
the
land
of
hearts
made
whole
the
wind
of
winter
the
winter
wind
the
wind
of
death
who
knocked
upon
my
door
now
through
the
entereth
invisible
and
hoar
he
breathes
around
his
icy
breath
and
treads
the
flickering
floor
i
heard
him
wandering
in
the
night
tap
at
my
window
pane
with
ghostly
fingers
snowy
white
i
heard
him
tug
in
vain
until
the
shuddering
with
fear
did
cringe
and
strain
the
fire
awakened
by
his
voice
leapt
up
with
frantic
arms
like
some
wild
babe
that
greets
with
noise
its
father
home
who
storms
with
rosy
gestures
that
rejoice
and
crimson
kiss
that
warms
now
in
the
hearth
he
sits
and
drowned
among
the
ashes
blows
or
through
the
room
goes
stealing
on
toes
deep
mantled
in
the
drowsy
sound
of
night
that
sleets
and
snows
and
oft
like
some
thin
the
stormy
hush
amid
i
hear
his
captive
trebles
ring
beneath
the
kettle
lid
or
now
a
harp
of
elfland
string
in
some
dark
cranny
hid
again
i
hear
him
whine
cramped
in
the
gusty
flue
or
knotted
in
the
resinous
pine
raise
goblin
cry
and
hue
while
through
the
smoke
his
eyeballs
shine
a
sooty
red
and
blue
at
last
i
hear
him
nearing
dawn
take
up
his
roaring
broom
and
sweep
wild
leaves
from
wood
and
lawn
and
from
the
heavens
the
gloom
to
show
the
gaunt
world
lying
wan
and
morn
cold
rose
the
wind
of
summer
from
the
hills
and
far
away
all
the
long
warm
summer
day
comes
the
wind
and
seems
to
say
come
oh
come
and
let
us
go
where
the
meadows
bend
and
blow
waving
with
the
snow
the
sky
the
meadows
we
will
lie
watching
the
white
clouds
roll
by
while
your
hair
my
hands
shall
press
with
a
cooling
tenderness
till
your
grief
grows
less
and
less
come
oh
come
and
let
us
roam
where
the
waters
comb
flowing
crystal
into
foam
under
trees
whose
trunks
are
brown
on
the
banks
that
violets
crown
we
will
watch
the
fish
flash
down
while
your
ear
my
voice
shall
soothe
with
a
whisper
soft
and
smooth
till
your
care
shall
wax
uncouth
come
where
forests
line
on
line
armies
of
the
oak
and
pine
scale
the
hills
and
shout
and
shine
we
will
wander
hand
in
hand
ways
where
tall
the
toadstools
stand
white
of
fairyland
while
your
eyes
my
lips
shall
kiss
dewy
as
a
wild
rose
is
till
they
gaze
on
naught
but
bliss
on
the
meadows
you
will
hear
leaning
low
your
spirit
ear
cautious
footsteps
drawing
near
you
will
deem
it
but
a
bee
murmuring
soft
and
sleepily
till
your
inner
sight
shall
see
is
a
presence
passing
slow
all
its
shining
hair
ablow
through
the
tossing
snow
by
the
waters
if
you
will
and
your
inmost
soul
be
still
melody
your
ears
shall
fill
you
will
deem
it
but
the
stream
rippling
onward
in
a
dream
till
upon
your
gaze
shall
gleam
arm
of
spray
and
throat
of
foam
is
a
spirit
there
aroam
where
the
radiant
waters
comb
in
the
forest
if
you
heed
you
shall
hear
a
magic
reed
sow
sweet
notes
like
silver
seed
you
will
deem
your
ears
have
heard
stir
of
tree
or
song
of
bird
till
your
startled
eyes
are
blurred
by
a
vision
instant
seen
naked
gold
and
beryl
green
glimmering
bright
the
boughs
between
follow
me
and
you
shall
see
of
mystery
that
are
only
known
to
me
thus
outside
my
city
door
speaks
the
wind
its
wildwood
lore
speaks
and
lo
i
go
once
more
the
spirit
of
the
forest
spring
over
the
rocks
she
trails
her
locks
her
mossy
locks
that
drip
drip
drip
her
sparkling
eyes
smile
at
the
skies
in
and
fellowship
while
the
gleam
and
glance
of
her
countenance
lull
into
trance
the
woodland
places
as
over
the
rocks
she
trails
her
locks
her
dripping
locks
that
the
long
fern
graces
she
pours
clear
ooze
from
her
heart
cool
cruse
its
crystal
cruse
that
drips
drips
drips
and
all
the
day
its
diamond
spray
is
heard
to
play
from
her
and
the
slight
soft
sound
makes
haunted
ground
of
the
woods
around
that
the
sunlight
laces
as
she
pours
clear
ooze
from
her
heart
cool
cruse
its
dripping
cruse
that
no
man
traces
she
swims
and
swims
with
glimmering
limbs
with
lucid
limbs
that
drip
drip
drip
where
beechen
boughs
build
a
leafy
house
for
her
form
to
drowse
or
her
feet
to
trip
and
the
liquid
beat
of
her
rippling
feet
makes
sweet
the
forest
mazes
as
she
swims
and
swims
with
glimmering
limbs
with
dripping
limbs
through
the
twilight
hazes
then
wrapped
in
deeps
of
the
wild
she
sleeps
she
whispering
sleeps
and
drips
drips
drips
where
moon
and
mist
wreathe
neck
and
wrist
while
through
the
night
she
slips
and
the
heavenly
dream
of
her
soul
makes
gleam
the
falls
that
stream
and
the
foam
that
races
as
wrapped
in
deeps
of
the
wild
she
sleeps
she
dripping
sleeps
or
starward
gazes
to
the
i
small
twilight
singer
of
dew
and
mist
thou
gossamer
winger
of
dusk
dim
glimmer
how
cool
thy
note
sounds
how
thy
wings
of
shimmer
vibrate
meseems
for
summer
that
is
dead
or
dying
i
stand
and
listen
and
at
thy
song
the
that
glisten
with
rose
and
lily
seem
touched
with
sadness
and
the
tuberose
chilly
breathing
around
its
cold
and
colorless
breath
fills
the
pale
evening
with
wan
hints
of
death
ii
i
see
thee
quaintly
beneath
the
leaf
thy
winglets
faintly
as
thin
as
spangle
of
cobwebbed
rain
held
up
at
airy
angle
i
hear
thy
tinkle
thy
fairy
notes
the
silvery
stillness
sprinkle
investing
wholly
the
moonlight
with
divinest
melancholy
until
in
seeming
i
see
the
spirit
of
the
summer
dreaming
amid
her
ripened
orchards
her
great
grave
eyes
fixed
on
the
iii
as
beady
as
mist
minute
thy
notes
ring
low
and
reedy
the
vaguest
vapor
of
melody
now
near
now
like
some
taper
of
sound
far
fading
thou
of
music
aye
evading
among
the
bowers
the
stalks
of
autumn
weeds
and
flowers
by
hill
and
hollow
i
hear
thy
murmur
and
in
vain
i
follow
thou
voice
thou
elfin
cry
thou
dirge
that
tellest
beauty
she
must
die
iv
and
when
the
frantic
wild
winds
of
autumn
with
the
dead
leaves
antic
and
walnuts
scatter
the
mire
of
lanes
and
dropping
acorns
patter
in
grove
and
forest
like
some
frail
grief
with
the
rude
blast
thou
warrest
sending
thy
slender
far
cry
against
the
gale
that
rough
untender
untouched
of
sorrow
sweeps
thee
aside
where
haply
i
shall
find
thee
lying
tiny
cold
and
crushed
thy
weak
wings
folded
and
thy
music
hushed
the
owlet
i
when
dusk
is
drowned
in
drowsy
dreams
and
slow
the
hues
of
sunset
die
when
firefly
and
moth
go
by
and
in
still
streams
the
gleams
a
sickle
in
the
sky
then
from
the
hills
there
comes
a
cry
the
owlet
cry
a
shivering
voice
that
sobs
and
screams
that
frightened
screams
who
is
it
who
is
it
who
who
rides
through
the
dusk
and
dew
with
a
pair
o
horns
as
thin
as
thorns
and
face
a
bubble
blue
who
who
who
who
is
it
who
is
it
who
ii
when
night
has
dulled
the
lily
white
and
opened
wide
the
primrose
eyes
when
pale
mists
rise
and
veil
the
skies
and
the
height
in
whispering
flight
the
sounds
and
sighs
then
in
the
woods
again
it
cries
the
owlet
cries
a
shivering
voice
that
calls
in
fright
in
maundering
fright
who
is
it
who
is
it
who
who
walks
with
a
shuffling
shoe
the
gusty
trees
with
a
face
none
sees
and
a
form
as
ghostly
too
who
who
who
who
is
it
who
is
it
who
iii
when
midnight
leans
a
listening
ear
and
tinkles
on
her
insect
lutes
when
the
roots
the
cricket
flutes
and
marsh
and
mere
now
far
now
near
a
foots
then
the
pool
again
it
hoots
the
owlet
hoots
a
voice
that
shivers
as
with
fear
that
cries
in
fear
who
is

who
creeps
with
his
crew

here
where
a
tree
and
its

liana
leaning
over

streamlet
grow
once
a
nymph

diana
sat
in
the
ages

with
a
mortal

whom
she
had
mated

laughed
with

mortal
youth
ere
he
of
the
forest
the
god
who
hated
saw
and
changed
to
a
form
uncouth
ii
once
in
the
woods
she
had
heard
a
shepherd
heard
a
reed
in
a
golden
glade
followed
and
clad
in
the
skin
of
a
leopard
found
him
fluting
within
the
shade
found
him
sitting
with
bare
brown
shoulder
lithe
and
strong
as
a
sapling
oak
and
leaning
over
a
mossy
boulder
love
in
her
wildwood
heart
awoke
iii
white
she
was
as
a
dogwood
flower
pinkly
white
as
a
bloom
sweetly
white
as
a
hawtree
bower
full
of
dew
and
the
may
perfume
he
who
saw
her
above
him
burning
beautiful
naked
in
light
arrayed
deemed
her
diana
and
from
her
turning
leapt
to
his
feet
and
fled
afraid
iv
far
she
followed
and
called
and
pleaded
ever
he
fled
with
never
a
look
fled
till
he
came
to
this
spot
came
to
the
bank
of
this
forest
brook
here
for
a
moment
he
stopped
and
listened
heard
in
her
voice
her
heart
despair
saw
in
her
eyes
the
love
that
glistened
sank
on
her
bosom
and
rested
there
v
close
to
her
beauty
she
strained
and
pressed
him
held
and
bound
him
with
kiss
on
kiss
soft
with
her
arms
and
her
lips
caressed
him
sweeter
of
touch
than
a
blossom
is
spoke
to
his
heart
and
with
sweet
persuasion
mastered
his
soul
till
its
fear
was
flown
spoke
to
his
soul
till
its
mortal
evasion
vanished
and
body
and
soul
were
her
own
vi
many
a
day
had
they
met
and
mated
many
a
day
by
this
woodland
brook
when
he
of
the
forest
the
god
who
hated
came
on
their
love
and
changed
with
a
look
there
on
the
shore
while
they
joyed
and
jested
he
in
the
shadows
unseen
espied
her
like
the
goddess
diana
breasted
him
like
endymion
by
her
side
vii
lo
at
a
word
at
a
sign
their
folded
limbs
and
bodies
assumed
new
form
hers
to
the
shape
of
a
tree
were
molded
his
to
a
vine
with
surrounding
arm
so
they
stand
with
their
limbs
enlacing
nymph
and
mortal
upon
this
shore
he
forever
a
vine
embracing
her
a
silvery
sycamore
the
poet
he
stands
above
all
worldly
schism
and
gazing
over
life
abysm
beholds
within
the
starry
range
of
heaven
laws
of
death
and
change
that
through
his
soul
prophetic
prism
are
turned
to
rainbows
wild
and
strange
through
nature
is
his
hope
made
surer
of
that
ideal
his
allurer
by
whom
his
life
is
upward
drawn
to
mount
pale
pinnacles
of
dawn
which
all
that
is
fairer
purer
of
love
and
lore
it
comes
upon
an
alkahest
that
makes
gold
metal
of
dross
his
mind
is
where
one
petal
of
one
will
all
outweigh
the
facts
of
everyday
where
commonplaces
there
that
settle
are
changed
to
things
of
heavenly
ray
he
climbs
by
steps
of
stars
and
flowers
companioned
of
the
dreaming
hours
and
sets
his
feet
in
pastures
where
no
merely
mortal
feet
may
fare
and
higher
than
the
stars
he
towers
though
lowlier
than
the
flowers
there
his
comrades
are
his
own
high
fancies
and
thoughts
in
which
his
soul
romances
and
every
part
of
heaven
or
earth
he
visits
lo
assumes
new
worth
and
touched
with
loftier
traits
and
trances
as
with
a
lovelier
birth
he
is
the
play
likewise
the
player
the
word
that
said
also
the
sayer
and
in
the
books
of
heart
and
head
there
is
no
thing
he
has
not
read
of
time
and
tears
he
is
the
weigher
and
mouthpiece
the
quick
and
dead
he
dies
but
mounting
ever
higher
wings
from
out
his
pyre
above
our
mortal
day
and
night
clothed
on
with
sempiternal
light
and
raimented
in
thought
far
fire
flames
on
in
everlasting
flight
unseen
yet
seen
on
heights
of
visions
above
all
praise
and
world
derisions
his
spirit
and
his
deathless
brood
of
dreams
fare
on
a
multitude
while
on
the
pillar
of
great
missions
his
name
and
place
are
evening
on
the
farm
from
out
the
hills
where
twilight
stands
above
the
shadowy
pasture
lands
with
strained
and
strident
cry
beneath
pale
skies
that
sunset
bands
the
fly
a
cloud
hangs
over
strange
of
shape
and
colored
like
the
grape
seems
some
uneven
stain
on
heaven
azure
thin
as
crape
and
blue
as
rain
by
ways
that
sunset
sardonyx
and
gates
the
farmboy
clicks
through
which
the
cattle
came
the
mullein
stalks
seem
giant
wicks
of
downy
flame
from
woods
no
glimmer
enters
in
above
the
streams
that
wandering
win
from
out
the
violet
hills
those
haunters
of
the
dusk
begin
the
whippoorwills
adown
the
dark
the
firefly
marks
its
flight
in
sparks
and
loosened
from
his
chain
the
shaggy
watchdog
bounds
and
barks
and
barks
again
each
breeze
brings
scents
of
hay
and
now
an
owlet
far
away
cries
twice
or
thrice
twohoo
and
cool
dim
moths
of
mottled
gray
flit
through
the
dew
the
silence
sounds
its
where
on
the
woodland
creek
lagoon
pale
as
a
ghostly
girl
lost
the
trees
looks
down
the
moon
with
face
of
pearl
within
the
shed
where
logs
late
hewed
smell
and
chips
of
wood
make
blurs
of
white
and
brown
the
cuddles
her
warm
brood
of
teetering
down
the
clattering
guineas
in
the
tree
din
for
a
time
and
quietly
the
henhouse
near
the
fence
sleeps
save
for
some
brief
rivalry
of
cocks
and
hens
a
tinkles
by
the
rails
where
streaming
white
in
foaming
pails
milk
makes
an
uddery
sound
while
overhead
the
black
bat
trails
around
and
the
night
is
still
the
slow
cows
chew
a
drowsy
cud
the
bird
that
flew
and
sang
is
in
its
nest
it
is
the
time
of
falling
dew
of
dreams
and
rest
the
brown
bees
sleep
and
the
walk
the
garden
path
from
stalk
to
stalk
the
bungling
beetle
booms
where
two
soft
shadows
stand
and
talk
among
the
blooms
the
stars
are
thick
the
light
is
dead
that
dyed
the
west
and
drowsyhead
tuning
his
nods
and
some
apple
round
and
red
drops
over
ripe
now
down
the
road
that
shambles
by
a
window
shining
like
an
eye
through
climbing
rose
and
gourd
shows
where
toil
sups
and
these
things
lie
his
heart
and
hoard
the
brook
to
it
the
forest
tells
the
mystery
that
haunts
its
heart
and
folds
its
form
in
cogitation
deep
that
holds
the
shadow
of
each
myth
that
dwells
in
nature
be
it
nymph
or
fay
or
faun
and
whispering
of
them
to
the
dales
and
dells
it
wanders
on
and
on
to
it
the
heaven
shows
the
secret
of
its
soul
true
images
of
dreams
that
form
its
aspect
and
with
these
reflected
in
its
countenance
it
goes
with
pictures
of
the
skies
the
dusk
and
dawn
within
its
breast
as
every
blossom
knows
for
them
to
gaze
upon
through
it
the
sends
its
heart
creating
pulse
that
beats
and
sings
the
music
of
maternity
whence
springs
all
life
and
shaping
earthly
ends
from
the
deep
sources
of
the
heavens
drawn
planting
its
ways
with
beauty
on
it
wends
on
and
forever
on
summer
noontide
the
slender
snail
clings
to
the
leaf
gray
on
its
silvered
underside
and
slowly
slowlier
than
the
snail
with
brief
bright
steps
whose
ripening
touch
foretells
the
sheaf
her
warm
hands
comes
down
the
tanned
noontide
the
pungent
fragrance
of
the
mint
and
pennyroyal
drench
her
gown
that
leaves
long
shreds
of
tint
among
the
thorns
and
everywhere
the
glint
of
gold
and
white
and
brown
her
flowery
steps
waft
down
the
leaves
like
hands
with
emerald
veined
along
her
way
try
their
wild
best
to
reach
the
jewel
whose
hot
hue
was
drained
from
some
rich
rose
that
all
the
june
contained
the
butterfly
soft
pressed
upon
her
sunny
breast
her
shawl
the
elder
bloom
she
hangs
upon
the
hillside
brake
smelling
of
warmth
and
of
her
breast
perfume
and
lying
in
the
gloom
beside
the
lilied
lake
she
stares
the
buds
awake
or
with
a
smile
through
watery
deeps
she
leads
the
oaring
turtle
legs
or
guides
the
crimson
fish
that
swims
and
sleeps
from
pad
to
pad
from
which
the
young
frog
leaps
and
to
its
nest
green
eggs
the
bird
that
pleads
and
begs
then
the
fields
of
unmown
hay
she
shows
the
bees
where
sweets
are
found
and
points
the
butterflies
at
airy
play
and
dragonflies
along
the
where
honeyed
flowers
abound
for
them
to
flicker
or
where
ripe
apples
pelt
with
gold
some
barn
around
which
coned
with
snow
the
blooms
she
mounts
its
old
mossed
roof
and
through
warped
sides
the
knots
have
holed
lets
her
long
glances
glow
into
the
loft
below
to
show
the
at
its
cell
slenderly
busy
swallows
too
packing
against
a
beam
their
nest
clay
shell
and
crouching
in
the
dark
the
owl
as
well
with
all
her
downy
crew
of
owlets
gray
of
hue
these
are
her
joys
and
until
dusk
lounging
she
walks
where
reapers
reap
from
sultry
raiment
shaking
scents
of
musk
rustling
the
corn
within
its
silken
husk
and
driving
down
deep
white
herds
of
clouds
like
sheep
heat
i
now
is
it
as
if
spring
had
never
been
and
winter
but
a
memory
and
dream
here
where
the
summer
stands
her
lap
of
green
heaped
high
with
bloom
and
beam
among
her
low
that
lean
to
kiss
her
feet
or
that
stare
upon
the
dragonfly
which
slimly
seen
like
a
blue
jewel
flickering
in
her
hair
sparkles
above
them
there
ii
among
the
tepid
pools
the
cows
chew
a
slow
cud
or
switch
a
slower
tail
in
sleep
beneath
the
beechen
boughs
where
thin
the
ail
from
bloom
to
bloom
the
languid
butterflies
drowse
the
sleepy
bees
make
hardly
any
sound
the
only
things
the
sunrays
can
arouse
it
seems
are
two
black
beetles
rolling
upon
the
dusty
ground
iii
within
its
channel
glares
the
creek
and
shrinks
beneath
whose
rocks
the
furtive
crawfish
hides
in
stagnant
places
where
the
green
frog
blinks
and
glides
far
hotter
seems
it
for
the
bird
that
drinks
the
startled
kingfisher
that
screams
and
flies
hotter
and
lonelier
for
the
purple
pinks
of
weeds
that
bloom
whose
sultry
perfumes
rise
stifling
the
swooning
skies
iv
from
ragweed
fallows
rye
fields
heaped
with
sheaves
from
blistering
rocks
no
moss
or
lichens
crust
and
from
the
road
where
every
heaves
a
cloud
of
burning
dust
the
hotness
quivers
making
limp
the
leaves
that
loll
like
tongues
of
panting
hounds
the
heat
is
a
wan
wimple
that
the
summer
weaves
a
veil
in
which
she
wraps
as
in
a
sheet
the
shriveling
corn
and
wheat
v
furious
incessant
in
the
weeds
and
briers
the
sawing
sing
and
the
grasshoppers
so
many
strident
wires
staccato
fiercely
hot
a
lash
of
whirling
sound
that
never
tires
the
locust
flails
the
noon
where
harnessed
thirst
beside
the
many
a
shod
hoof
mires
into
the
trough
thrusts
his
hot
head
immersed
which
cool
bubbles
burst
vi
the
sad
sweet
voice
of
some
who
laments
while
watching
a
loved
oak
tree
die
from
the
deep
forest
comes
the
coo
a
long
lost
lonely
cry
oh
for
a
breeze
a
mighty
wind
to
woo
the
woods
to
stormy
laughter
sow
like
grain
the
world
with
freshness
of
invisible
dew
and
pile
above
far
fevered
hill
and
plain
vast
bastions
black
with
rain
july
now
is
the
time
when
tall
the
long
blue
torches
of
the
bellflower
gleam
among
the
trees
and
by
the
wooded
stream
in
many
a
fragrant
ball
blooms
of
the
fall
let
us
go
forth
and
seek
woods
where
the
wild
plums
redden
and
the
beech
plumps
its
packed
burs
and
swelling
just
in
reach
the
pawpaw
emerald
sleek
ripens
along
the
creek
now
is
the
time
when
ways
of
glimmering
green
flaunt
white
the
misty
plumes
of
the
and
through
bramble
glooms
a
blur
of
orange
rays
the
blaze
let
us
go
forth
and
hear
the
spiral
music
that
the
locusts
beat
and
that
small
spray
of
sound
so
grassy
sweet
dear
to
a
country
ear
the
cricket
summer
cheer
now
golden
celandine
is
hairy
hung
with
silvery
sacks
of
seeds
and
bugled
with
freckled
gold
like
beads
beneath
the
vine
the
blossoms
shine
let
us
go
forth
and
see
the
and
the
butterfly
like
gems
spangling
the
sunbeams
and
the
clover
stems
weighed
down
by
many
a
bee
nodding
mellifluously
now
morns
are
full
of
song
the
catbird
and
the
redbird
and
the
jay
upon
the
hilltops
rouse
the
rosy
day
who
dewy
blithe
and
strong
lures
their
wild
wings
along
now
noons
are
full
of
dreams
the
clouds
of
heaven
and
the
wandering
breeze
follow
a
vision
and
the
flowers
and
trees
the
hills
and
fields
and
streams
are
lapped
in
mystic
gleams
the
nights
are
full
of
love
the
stars
and
moon
take
up
the
golden
tale
of
the
sunk
sun
and
passionate
and
pale
mixing
their
fires
above
grow
eloquent
thereof
such
days
are
like
a
sigh
that
beauty
heaves
from
a
full
heart
of
bliss
such
nights
are
like
the
sweetness
of
a
kiss
on
lips
that
half
deny
the
warm
lips
of
july
to
the
locust
thou
pulse
of
hotness
who
with
breast
makest
meridian
music
long
and
loud
accentuating
summer
dost
thy
best
to
make
the
sunbeams
fiercer
and
to
crowd
with
lonesomeness
the
long
close
afternoon
when
labor
leans
and
beady
browed
upon
his
sultry
scythe
thou
tangible
tune
of
heat
whose
waves
incessantly
arise
quivering
and
clear
beneath
the
cloudless
skies
thou
singest
and
upon
his
haggard
hills
drouth
yawns
and
rubs
his
heavy
eyes
and
wakes
brushes
the
hot
hair
from
his
face
and
fills
the
land
with
death
as
sullenly
he
takes
downward
his
dusty
way
woods
and
fields
at
every
pool
his
burning
thirst
he
slakes
no
grove
so
deep
no
bank
so
high
it
shields
a
spring
from
him
no
creek
evades
his
eye
he
needs
but
look
and
they
are
withered
dry
thou
singest
and
thy
song
is
as
a
spell
of
somnolence
to
charm
the
land
with
sleep
a
thorn
of
sound
that
pierces
dale
and
dell
diffusing
slumber
over
vale
and
steep
sleepy
the
forest
nodding
sleepy
boughs
the
pastures
sleepy
with
their
sleepy
sheep
sleepy
the
creek
where
sleepily
the
cows
stand
and
the
very
heaven
seems
sleepy
and
lost
in
undetermined
dreams
art
thou
a
rattle
that
monotony
summer
dull
nurse
old
sister
of
slow
time
shakes
for
day
peevish
pleasure
who
in
glee
takes
its
discordant
music
for
sweet
rhyme
or
oboe
that
the
summer
noontide
plays
sitting
with
ripeness
the
trying
repeatedly
the
same
shrill
phrase
until
the
musky
peach
with
drowsiness
drops
and
the
hum
of
bees
grows
less
and
less
young
september
i
with
a
look
and
a
laugh
where
the
stream
was
flowing
september
led
me
along
the
land
where
the
and
lobelia
glowing
seemed
burning
torches
within
her
hand
and
faint
as
the
thistle
or
feather
i
glimpsed
her
form
through
the
sparkling
weather
ii
now
was
her
hand
and
now
her
hair
that
tossed
me
welcome
everywhere
that
lured
me
onward
through
the
stately
rooms
of
forest
hung
and
carpeted
with
glooms
and
windowed
wide
with
azure
doored
with
green
through
which
rich
glimmers
of
her
robe
were
seen
now
like
some
deep
rosy
gold
now
like
the
great
fold
on
fold
of
heavy
mauve
and
now
like
the
intense
massed
a
purple
opulence
iii
along
the
bank
in
a
wild
procession
of
gold
and
sapphire
the
blossoms
blew
and
borne
on
the
breeze
came
their
soft
confession
in
syllables
musk
of
honey
and
dew
in
words
unheard
that
their
lips
kept
saying
sweet
as
the
lips
of
children
praying
iv
and
so
meseemed
i
heard
them
tell
how
here
her
loving
glance
once
fell
upon
this
bank
and
from
its
azure
grew
the
ageratum
happy
hue
how
from
her
kiss
as
crimson
as
the
dawn
the
drew
its
vermilion
and
from
her
hair
blond
touch
th
elecampane
evolved
the
glory
of
its
golden
rain
white
from
her
starry
footsteps
redolent
the
aster
pearled
its
flowery
firmament
under
the
hunter
moon
white
from
her
chrysalis
of
cloud
the
moon
swings
upward
through
the
night
and
all
the
stars
that
crowd
the
hollow
hive
of
wane
in
her
light
along
the
distance
folds
of
mist
hang
ridging
all
the
dark
with
gray
tinting
the
trees
with
amethyst
touching
with
pearl
and
purple
every
spray
all
night
the
stealthy
frost
and
fog
conspire
to
slay
the
weeds
and
flowers
to
strip
of
wealth
the
woods
and
clog
with
gold
of
leaves
the
creek
that
cowers
i
seem
to
see
their
spirits
stand
molded
of
moonlight
faint
of
form
and
face
now
reaching
high
a
chilly
hand
to
pluck
some
walnut
from
its
spicy
place
now
with
fine
fingers
splitting
the
wahoo
pods
of
rose
and
thin
the
bittersweet
balls
o
gold
to
show
the
berries
packed
within
now
on
dim
threads
of
gossamer
stringing
pale
pearls
of
moisture
necklacing
the
and
spreading
cobweb
fur
crystaled
with
stardew
over
everything
while
the
moon
with
feet
they
go
and
chill
a
music
draw
from
wan
flutes
the
sweet
sad
dirge
of
autumn
dying
in
the
shaw
rain
in
the
woods
when
on
the
leaves
the
rain
persists
and
every
gust
brings
showers
down
when
all
the
woodland
smokes
with
mists
i
take
the
old
road
out
of
town
into
the
hills
through
which
it
twists
i
find
the
vale
where
catnip
grows
where
boneset
blooms
with
moisture
bowed
the
vale
through
which
the
red
creek
flows
turbid
with
clay
and
loud
as
some
wild
horn
a
hunter
blows
around
the
root
the
beetle
glides
a
living
beryl
and
the
ant
large
a
garnet
slides
beneath
the
rock
and
every
plant
is
roof
for
some
frail
thing
that
hides
like
knots
against
the
trunks
of
trees
the
moths
are
pressed
and
wedged
in
hollow
blooms
the
bees
seem
clots
of
pollen
in
its
nest
the
wasp
has
crawled
and
lies
at
ease
the
locust
harsh
that
sharply
saws
the
silence
of
the
summer
noon
the
katydid
that
thinly
draws
its
fine
file
the
bars
of
moon
and
grasshopper
that
drills
each
pause
the
mantis
furtive
lean
fierce
feline
of
the
insect
hordes
and
dragonfly
and
green
beneath
the
leaves
and
gourd
have
housed
themselves
and
rest
unseen
the
butterfly
and
are
huddled
on
the
same
gnarled
bough
from
which
like
some
word
that
dampness
hoarsely
utters
now
the
voice
is
vaguely
heard
i
crouch
and
listen
and
again
the
woods
are
filled
with
phantom
forms
with
shapes
grotesque
in
mystic
train
that
rise
and
reach
to
me
cool
arms
of
mist
the
wandering
wraiths
of
rain
i
see
them
come
fantastic
fair
chill
sky
and
earth
grow
ghostly
with
their
floating
hair
and
trailing
limbs
that
have
their
birth
in
wetness
fungi
of
the
air
o
wraiths
of
rain
o
ghosts
of
mist
still
fold
me
hold
me
and
pursue
still
let
my
lips
by
yours
be
kissed
still
draw
me
with
your
hands
of
dew
unto
the
tryst
the
dripping
tryst
in
the
lane
when
the
hornet
hangs
in
the
hollyhock
and
the
brown
bee
drones
i
the
rose
and
the
west
is
a
and
summer
is
near
its
close
it
oh
for
the
gate
and
the
locust
lane
and
dusk
and
dew
and
home
again
when
the
katydid
sings
and
the
cricket
cries
and
ghosts
of
the
mists
ascend
and
the
is
a
lamp
i
the
skies
and
summer
is
near
its
end
it
oh
for
the
fence
and
the
leafy
lane
and
the
twilight
peace
and
the
tryst
again
when
the
owlet
hoots
in
the
that
leans
to
the
rippling
run
and
the
wind
is
a
wildwood
melody
and
summer
is
almost
done
it
oh
for
the
bridge
and
the
bramble
lane
and
the
fragrant
hush
and
her
hands
again
when
fields
smell
moist
with
the
dewy
hay
and
woods
are
cool
and
wan
and
a
path
for
dreams
is
the
and
summer
is
nearly
gone
it
oh
for
the
rock
and
the
woodland
lane
and
the
silence
and
stars
and
her
lips
again
when
the
weight
of
the
apples
breaks
down
the
boughs
and
split
with
sweet
and
the
moon
is
in
the
heaven
house
and
summer
has
spent
its
heat
it
oh
for
the
lane
the
trysting
lane
and
the
night
and
her
love
again
a
forest
idyl
i
beneath
an
old
they
sat
together
fair
as
a
flower
was
she
of
summer
weather
they
spoke
of
life
and
love
while
through
the
boughs
above
the
sunlight
like
a
dove
dropped
many
a
feather
ii
and
there
the
violet
the
bluet
near
it
made
blurs
of
azure
wet
as
if
some
spirit
or
woodland
dream
had
gone
sprinkling
the
earth
with
dawn
when
only
fay
and
faun
could
see
or
hear
it
iii
she
with
her
young
sweet
face
and
eyes
made
of
that
forest
place
a
spot
for
dreaming
a
spot
for
oreads
to
smooth
their
braids
for
dryads
of
the
glades
to
dance
in
gleaming
iv
so
dim
the
place
so
blest
one
had
not
wondered
had
dian
moonéd
breast
the
deep
leaves
sundered
and
there
on
them
awhile
the
goddess
deigned
to
smile
while
down
some
forest
aisle
the
far
hunt
thundered
v
i
deem
that
hour
perchance
was
but
a
mirror
to
show
them
earth
romance
and
draw
them
nearer
a
mirror
where
meseems
all
that
this
dreams
all
loveliness
that
gleams
their
souls
saw
clearer
vi
beneath
an
old
they
dreamed
of
blisses
fair
as
a
flower
was
she
that
summer
kisses
they
spoke
of
dreams
and
days
of
love
that
goes
and
stays
of
all
for
which
life
prays
ah
me
and
misses
under
the
rose
he
told
a
story
to
her
a
story
old
yet
new
and
was
it
of
the
faëry
folk
that
dance
along
the
dew
the
night
was
hung
with
silence
as
a
room
is
hung
with
cloth
and
soundless
through
the
hush
swooned
dim
the
moth
along
the
east
a
shimmer
a
tenuous
breath
of
flame
from
which
as
from
a
bath
of
light
the
came
and
pendent
in
the
purple
of
heaven
like
fireflies
bubbles
of
gold
the
great
stars
blew
from
windows
of
the
skies
he
told
a
story
to
her
a
story
full
of
dreams
and
was
it
of
the
elfin
things
that
haunt
the
thin
moonbeams
upon
the
hill
a
crooked
and
gnarled
and
gray
against
the
moon
seemed
some
crutch
hag
dragging
a
child
away
and
in
the
vale
a
runnel
that
dripped
from
shelf
to
shelf
seemed
in
the
night
a
woodland
witch
who
muttered
to
herself
along
the
land
a
zephyr
whose
breath
was
wild
perfume
that
seemed
a
sorceress
who
wove
sweet
spells
of
beam
and
bloom
he
told
a
story
to
her
a
story
young
yet
old
and
was
it
of
the
mystic
things
men
eyes
shall
behold
they
heard
the
dew
drip
faintly
from
out
the
leaf
they
heard
the
petals
of
the
rose
unfolding
from
their
sheaf
they
saw
the
wind
the
waters
into
sheen
they
saw
the
starlight
kiss
to
sleep
the
blossoms
on
the
green
they
heard
and
saw
these
wonders
these
things
they
saw
and
heard
and
other
things
within
the
heart
for
which
there
is
no
word
he
told
a
story
to
her
the
story
men
call
love
whose
echoes
fill
the
ages
past
and
the
world
tires
of
in
autumn
i
sunflowers
wither
and
lilies
die
poppies
are
pods
of
seeds
the
first
red
leaves
on
the
pathway
lie
like
blood
of
a
heart
that
bleeds
weary
alway
will
it
be
weary
and
wan
and
wet
dawn
and
noon
will
the
clouds
hang
gray
and
the
autumn
wind
will
sigh
and
say
comes
not
yet
not
yet
weary
alway
alway
ii
hollyhocks
bend
all
tattered
and
torn
marigolds
all
are
gone
the
last
pale
rose
lies
all
forlorn
like
love
that
is
trampled
on
weary
ah
me
will
be
weary
and
wild
and
hoar
rain
and
mist
will
blow
from
the
sea
and
the
wind
will
sob
in
the
autumn
tree
comes
no
more
no
more
weary
ah
me
ah
me
epiphany
there
is
nothing
that
eases
my
heart
so
much
as
the
wind
that
blows
from
the
purple
hills
is
a
hand
of
balsam
whose
healing
touch
unburdens
my
bosom
of
ills
there
is
nothing
that
causes
my
soul
to
rejoice
like
the
sunset
flaming
without
a
flaw
is
a
burning
bush
whence
god
own
voice
addresses
my
spirit
with
awe
there
is
nothing
that
hallows
my
mind
meseems
like
the
night
with
its
moon
and
its
stars
above
is
a
mystical
lily
whose
golden
gleams
fulfill
my
being
with
love
there
is
nothing
no
nothing
we
see
and
feel
that
speaks
to
our
souls
some
beautiful
thought
that
was
not
created
to
help
us
and
heal
our
lives
that
are
overwrought
life
i
pessimist
there
is
never
a
thing
we
dream
or
do
but
was
dreamed
and
done
in
the
ages
gone
everything
old
there
is
nothing
that
new
and
so
it
will
be
while
the
world
goes
on
the
thoughts
we
think
have
been
thought
before
the
deeds
we
do
have
long
been
done
we
pride
ourselves
on
our
love
and
lore
and
both
are
as
old
as
the
moon
and
sun
we
strive
and
struggle
and
swink
and
sweat
and
the
end
for
each
is
one
and
the
same
time
and
the
sun
and
the
frost
and
wet
will
wear
from
its
pillar
the
greatest
name
no
answer
comes
for
our
prayer
or
curse
no
word
replies
though
we
shriek
in
air
ever
the
taciturn
universe
stretches
unchanged
for
our
curse
or
prayer
with
our
mind
small
light
in
the
dark
we
crawl
glimmers
that
creep
about
tilt
the
power
that
shaped
us
over
us
all
poises
his
foot
and
treads
us
out
unasked
he
fashions
us
out
of
clay
a
little
water
a
little
dust
and
then
in
our
holes
he
thrusts
us
away
with
never
a
word
to
rot
and
rust
is
a
sorry
play
with
a
sorry
plot
this
life
of
hate
and
of
lust
and
pain
where
we
play
our
parts
and
are
soon
forgot
and
all
that
we
do
is
done
in
vain
ii
optimist
there
is
never
a
dream
but
it
shall
come
true
and
never
a
deed
but
was
wrought
by
plan
and
life
is
filled
with
the
strange
and
new
and
ever
has
been
since
the
world
began
as
mind
develops
and
soul
matures
these
two
shall
parent
earth
mightier
acts
love
is
a
fact
and
is
love
endures
the
world
make
wreck
of
all
other
facts
through
thought
alone
shall
our
age
obtain
above
all
ages
gone
before
the
tribes
of
sloth
of
brawn
not
brain
are
the
tribes
that
perish
are
known
no
more
within
ourselves
is
a
voice
of
awe
and
a
hand
that
points
to
balanced
scales
the
one
is
love
and
the
other
law
and
their
presence
alone
it
is
avails
for
every
shadow
about
our
way
there
is
a
glory
of
moon
and
sun
but
the
hope
within
us
hath
more
of
ray
than
the
light
of
the
sun
and
moon
in
one
behind
all
being
a
purpose
lies
undeviating
as
god
hath
willed
and
he
alone
it
is
who
dies
who
leaves
that
purpose
unfulfilled
life
is
an
epic
the
master
sings
whose
theme
is
man
and
whose
music
soul
where
each
is
a
word
in
the
song
of
things
that
shall
roll
on
while
the
ages
roll

love
hath
no
place
in
her
though
in
her
bosom

that

love
hath
no

no

never
her
soul
replies
to
the
sad
soul
in
me
never
with

and

speaks
she
to
me
she
is
a
star
a
rose
i
but
a
moth
a
bee
high
in
her
heaven
she
glows
blooms
far
away
from
me
she
is
a
star
a
rose
never

me
why
will
i
think
of
her
to
my

misery
dreaming
how
sweet
it
were
had
she
a

of
me
why
will
i
think
of
her
why
why
ah
me
meeting
in
the
woods
through
ferns
and
moss
the
path
wound
to
a
hollow
where
the
touchmenots
swung
horns
of
honey
filled
with
dew
and
where
like
violets
blue
and
bluets
made
sweet
sapphire
blots
was
there
that
she
had
passed
he
knew
the
grass
the
very
wilderness
on
either
side
breathed
rapture
of
her
passage
was
her
hand
or
dress
that
touched
some
tree
a
slight
caress
that
made
the
sing
above
her
step
that
made
the
flowers
he
hurried
till
across
his
way
bounding
through
the
wood
a
brook
like
some
wild
girl
at
play
went
laughing
loud
its
roundelay
and
there
upon
its
bank
she
stood
a
sunbeam
clad
in
woodland
gray
and
when
she
saw
him
all
her
face
grew
to
a
wildrose
by
the
stream
and
to
his
breast
a
moment
space
he
gathered
her
and
all
the
place
seemed
conscious
of
some
happy
dream
come
true
to
add
to
earth
its
grace
some
joy
on
which
was
intent
for
which
god
made
the
world
the
bliss
the
love
that
raised
her
innocent
pure
face
to
his
that
smiling
bent
and
sealed
confession
with
a
kiss
life
needs
no
other
testament
a
maid
who
died
old
frail
shrunken
face
so
pinched
and
worn
that
life
has
carved
with
care
and
doubt
so
weary
waiting
night
and
morn
for
that
which
never
came
about
pale
lamp
so
utterly
forlorn
in
which
god
light
at
last
is
out
gray
hair
that
lies
so
thin
and
prim
on
either
side
the
sunken
brows
and
soldered
eyes
so
deep
and
dim
no
word
of
man
could
now
arouse
and
hollow
hands
so
virgin
slim
forever
clasped
in
silent
vows
poor
breasts
that
god
designed
for
love
for
baby
lips
to
kiss
and
press
that
never
felt
yet
dreamed
thereof
the
human
touch
the
child
caress
that
lie
like
shriveled
blooms
above
the
heart
happiness
o
withered
body
nature
gave
for
purposes
of
death
and
birth
that
never
knew
and
could
but
crave
those
things
perhaps
that
make
life
worth
rest
now
alas
within
the
grave
sad
shell
that
served
no
end
of
earth
communicants
who
knows
the
things
they
dream
alas
or
feel
who
lie
beneath
the
ground
perhaps
the
flowers
the
leaves
and
grass
that
close
them
round
in
spring
the
violets
may
spell
the
moods
of
them
we
know
not
of
or
lilies
sweetly
syllable
their
thoughts
of
love
haply
in
summer
dew
and
scent
of
all
they
feel
may
be
a
part
each
red
rose
be
the
testament
of
some
rich
heart
the
winds
of
fall
be
utterance
perhaps
of
saddest
things
they
say
wild
leaves
may
word
some
dead
romance
in
some
dim
way
in
winter
all
their
sleep
profound
through
frost
may
speak
to
grass
and
stream
the
snow
may
be
the
silent
sound
of
all
they
dream
the
dead
day
the
west
builds
high
a
sepulchre
of
cloudy
granite
and
of
gold
where
twilight
priestly
hours
inter
the
day
like
some
great
king
of
old
a
censer
rimmed
with
silver
fire
the
new
moon
swings
above
his
tomb
while
of
god
own
choir
star
after
star
throbs
in
the
gloom
and
night
draws
near
the
sadly
sweet
a
nun
whose
face
is
calm
and
fair
and
kneeling
at
the
dead
day
feet
her
soul
goes
up
in
silent
prayer
in
prayer
we
feel
through
dewy
gleam
and
flowery
fragrance
and
above
all
earth
the
ecstasy
and
dream
that
haunt
the
mystic
heart
of
love
onward
he
gallops
through
enchanted
gloom
the
spectres
of
the
forest
dark
and
dim
and
shadows
of
vast
death
environ
him
onward
he
spurs
victorious
over
doom
before
his
eyes
that
love
far
fires
illume
where
courage
sits
impregnable
and
grim
the
form
and
features
of
beauty
swim
beckoning
him
on
with
looks
that
fears
consume
the
thought
of
her
distress
her
lips
to
kiss
mails
him
with
triple
might
and
so
at
last
to
lust
huge
keep
he
comes
its
giant
wall
frowning
from
the
precipice
and
through
its
gate
borne
like
a
bugle
blast
night
and
hell
he
thunders
to
his
all
the
end
of
summer
pods
are
the
poppies
and
slim
spires
of
pods
the
hollyhocks
the
balsam
pearly
bredes
of
snow
are
little
sacs
of
seeds
collapsing
at
a
touch
the
lote
that
sods
the
pond
with
green
has
changed
its
flowers
to
rods
and
discs
of
vesicles
and
all
the
weeds
around
the
sleepy
water
and
its

summer

ay
me
sweet
summer
dead
the
sunset
clouds
have
built
her
funeral
pyre
through
which
now
runs
subterranean
fire
while
from
the
east
as
from
a
garden
bed
the
dusk
lifts
her
broad
moon
like
some
great
golden
melon
saying
fall
has
come
light
and
wind
where
through
the
leaves
of
myriad
forest
trees
the
daylight
falls
beryl
and
chrysoprase
the
glamour
and
the
glimmer
of
its
rays
seem
visible
music
tangible
melodies
light
that
is
music
music
that
one
sees
wagnerian
music
where
forever
sways
the
spirit
of
romance
and
gods
and
fays
take
form
clad
on
with
dreams
and
mysteries
and
now
the
wind
transmuting
necromance
touches
the
light
and
makes
it
fall
and
rise
vocal
a
harp
of
multitudinous
waves
that
speaks
as
ocean
speaks
an
utterance
of
whispers
sighs
pelagian
vast
in

caves
superstition
in
the
waste
places
in
the
dreadful
night
when
the
wood
whispers
like
a
wandering
mind
and
silence
sits
and
listens
to
the
wind
or
the
rocks
to
some
wild
torrent
flight
thou
wadest
with
thy
wisp
of
light
among
black
pools
the
moon
can
never
find
or
thou
hootest
to
the
blind
deep
darkness
from
some
cave
or
haunted
height
he
who
beholds
but
once
thy
fearsome
face
never
again
shall
walk
alone
but
wan
and
terrible
attendants
shall
be
his
unutterable
things
that
have
no
place
in
god
or
beauty
that
compel
him
on
against
all
hope
where
endless
horror
is
uncalled
as
one
who
journeying
westward
with
the
sun
beholds
at
length
from
the
hills
far
off
a
land
unspeakable
beauty
fills
circean
peaks
and
vales
of
avalon
and
sinking
weary
watches
one
by
one
the
big
seas
beat
between
and
knows
it
skills
no
more
to
try
that
now
as
heaven
wills
this
is
the
helpless
end
that
all
is
done
so
is
with
him
whom
long
a
vision
led
in
quest
of
beauty
and
who
finds
at
last
she
lies
beyond
his
effort
all
the
waves
of
all
the
world
between
them
while
the
dead
the
myriad
dead
who
people
all
the
past
with
failure
hail
him
from
forgotten
graves
love
despised
can
one
resolve
and
hunt
it
from
one
heart
this
love
this
god
and
fiend
that
makes
a
hell
of
many
a
life
in
ways
no
tongue
can
tell
no
mind
divine
nor
any
word
impart
would
not
one
think
the
slights
that
make
hearts
smart
the
ice
of
love
disdain
the
well
of
love
disfavor
love
own
fire
would
quell
or
school
its
nature
too
to
its
own
art
why
will
men
cringe
and
cry
forever
here
for
that
which
once
obtained
may
prove
a
curse
why
not
remember
that
however
fair
decay
is
wed
to
beauty
that
each
year
takes
somewhat
from
the
riches
of
her
purse
until
at
last
her
house
of
pride
stands
bare
the
death
of
love
so
love
is
dead
the
love
we
knew
of
old
and
in
the
sorrow
of
our
hearts
hushed
halls
a
lute
lies
broken
and
a
flower
falls
love
house
is
empty
and
his
hearth
is
cold
lone
in
dim
places
where
sweet
vows
were
told
in
walks
grown
desolate
by
ruined
walls
beauty
decays
and
on
their
pedestals
dreams
crumble
and
th
immortal
gods
are
mould
music
is
slain
or
sleeps
one
voice
alone
one
voice
awakes
and
like
a
wandering
ghost
haunts
all
the
echoing
chambers
of
the
past
the
voice
of
memory
that
stills
to
stone
the
soul
that
hears
the
mind
that
utterly
lost
before
its
beautiful
presence
stands
aghast
geraldine
geraldine
geraldine
geraldine
do
you
remember
where
the
willows
used
to
screen
the
water
flowing
fair
the
banks
of
green
where
first
our
love
begun
when
you
were
seventeen
and
i
was
geraldine
geraldine
do
you
remember
how
from
th
old
bridge
we
would
lean
the
bridge
that
broken
now
to
watch
the
minnows
sheen
and
the
ripples
of
the
run
when
you
were
seventeen
and
i
was
geraldine
geraldine
do
you
remember
too
the
old
between
whose
roots
the
wild
flowers
grew
where
oft
we
met
at
when
stars
were
few
or
none
when
you
were
seventeen
and
i
was
geraldine
geraldine
the
bark
has
grown
around
the
names
i
cut
therein
and
the
that
bound
the
clear
and
clean
i
carved
when
our
love
begun
when
you
were
seventeen
and
i
was
geraldine
geraldine
the
roof
of
the
farmhouse
gray
is
fallen
and
mossy
green
its
rafters
rot
away
the
old
path
scarce
is
seen
where
oft
our
feet
would
run
when
you
were
seventeen
and
i
was
geraldine
geraldine
through
each
old
tree
and
bough
the
lone
winds
cry
and
keen
the
place
is
haunted
now
with
ghosts
of
with
dreams
of
when
you
were
seventeen
and
i
was
geraldine
geraldine
there
in
your
world
of
wealth
there
where
you
move
a
queen
broken
in
heart
and
health
does
there
ever
rise
a
scene
of
days
your
soul
would
shun
when
you
were
seventeen
and
i
was
geraldine
geraldine
here
the
rose
and
rue
would
god
that
your
grave
were
green
and
i
were
lying
too
here
on
the
hill
i
mean
where
oft
we
laughed
i
the
sun
when
you
were
seventeen

i
was

for

one
never
praises
an
author
for
certain
things
without
afterward
doubting
if
they
were
the
characteristic
things
or
whether
just
the
reverse
might
not
be
said
praise
is
in
fact
a
delicate
business
and
i
who
am
rather
fond
of
dealing
in
it
never
feel
quite
safe
not
only
is
it
questionable
at
the
moment
but
the
later
behavior
of
the
author
is
sometimes
such
that
one
is
sorry
not
to
have
made
it
blame
it
is
always
with
a
shrinking
which
i
try
to
hide
from
the
public
that
i
take
up
the
fresh
venture
of
a
poet
whom
i
have
once
bet
on
but
there
is
a
joy
when
i
find
that
i
have
not
lost
my
wager
which
is
full
compensation
for
the
anxiety
suffered
this
joy
has
lately
been
mine
in
the
latest
little
book
of
madison
cawein
whose
work
i
long
ago
confessed
my
pleasure
in
i
am
not
sure
that
he
has
transcended
the
limits
which
he
then
seemed
to
give
himself
as
the
lover
the
prophet
of
beauty
in
the
woods
and
waters
and
skies
of
the
southern
i
do
not
know
that
he
need
have
done
more
than
unlock
the
riches
of
emotion
within
these
limits
what
i
am
sure
of
is
that
in
by
the
wall
he
has
more
deeply
charmed
me
with
an
art
perfected
from
that
i
felt
in
of
the
berry
ten
or
fifteen
years
since
many
little
books
of
his
have
come
i
hope
not
also
gone
between
the
first
and
last
and
none
of
them
has
failed
to
make
me
glad
of
his
work
and
now
again
i
am
finding
the
same
impassioned
moods
in
the
same
impassive
presences
to
my
knowledge
no
such
nature
poems
have
been
written
within
the
time
since
cawein
began
to
write
as
his
are
or
from
such
an
intimacy
with
the
language
which
nature
speaks
there
are
other
good
poems
in
the
book
poems
which
would
have
made
reputes
in
the
eighteenth
century
and
which
it
would
be
a
shame
not
to
own
good
in
the
twentieth
but
those
which
speak
for
cricket
twilight
moth
grasshopper
screech
owl
chipmunk
the
rain
and
the
like
are
in
a
voice
which
interprets
the
very
soul
of
what
we
call
the
inarticulate
things
though
they
seem
to
have
enunciated
themselves
so
distinctly
to
this
poet
it
is
cheap
to
note
his
increasing
control
of
his
affluent
imagery
and
the
growing
mastery
that
makes
him
so
fine
an
artist
these
things
were
to
be
expected
from
his
early
poems
but
what
makes
one
think
he
will
go
far
and
long
and
outlive
both
praise
and
blame
is
the
blending
of
a
sense
of
the
kentucky
civilization
in
such
a
poem
as
civilization
may
not
be
quite
the
word
for
the
condition
of
things
suggested
here
but
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
the
dramatic
and
the
graphic
power
that
suggests
it
and
that
imparts
a
personal
sense
of
the
tragic
squalor
the
sultry
drouth
the
forlorn
wickedness
of
it
all
by
such
a
way
as
this
lies
cawein
hope
of
rise
from
nature
up
to
man
if
it
is
up
and
also
as
i
perceive
too
late
lies
confusion
for
the
critic
who
said
that
the
poet
does
not
transcend
the
limits
he
once
seemed
to
give
himself
transcriber
