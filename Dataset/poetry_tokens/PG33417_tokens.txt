an
appreciation
how
many
canadians
how
many
even
among
the
few
who
seek
to
keep
themselves
informed
of
the
best
in
contemporary
literature
who
are
ever
on
the
alert
for
the
new
voices
realise
or
even
suspect
that
this
northern
land
of
theirs
has
produced
a
poet
of
whom
it
may
be
affirmed
with
confidence
and
assurance
that
he
is
of
the
great
succession
of
english
poets
yet
such
strange
and
unbelievable
though
it
may
seem
is
in
very
truth
the
case
that
poet
being
to
give
him
his
full
name
william
bliss
carman
canada
has
full
right
to
be
proud
of
her
poets
a
small
body
though
they
are
but
not
only
does
carman
stand
high
and
clear
above
them
all
his
place
and
time
can
not
but
confirm
and
justify
the
assertion
is
among
those
men
whose
poetry
is
the
shining
glory
of
that
great
english
literature
which
is
our
common
heritage
if
any
should
ask
why
if
what
has
been
just
said
is
so
there
has
been
as
must
be
admitted
no
general
recognition
of
the
fact
in
the
poet
home
land
i
would
answer
that
there
are
various
and
plausible
if
not
good
reasons
for
it
first
of
all
the
poet
as
thousands
more
of
our
young
men
of
ambition
and
confidence
have
done
went
early
to
the
united
states
and
until
recently
except
for
rare
and
brief
visits
to
his
old
home
down
by
the
sea
has
never
returned
to
canada
though
for
all
that
i
am
able
to
state
on
his
own
authority
he
is
still
a
canadian
citizen
then
all
his
books
have
had
their
original
publication
in
the
united
states
and
while
a
few
of
them
have
subsequently
carried
the
imprints
of
canadian
publishers
none
of
these
can
be
said
ever
to
have
made
any
special
effort
to
push
their
sale
another
reason
for
the
fact
above
mentioned
is
that
carman
has
always
scorned
to
advertise
himself
while
his
work
has
never
been
the
subject
of
the
and
booming
which
the
work
of
many
another
poet
has
had
to
his
ultimate
loss
a
further
reason
is
that
he
follows
a
rule
of
his
own
in
preparing
his
books
for
publication
most
poets
publish
a
volume
of
their
work
as
soon
as
through
their
industry
and
perseverance
they
have
material
enough
on
hand
to
make
publication
desirable
in
their
eyes
not
so
with
carman
however
his
rule
being
not
to
publish
until
he
has
done
sufficient
work
of
a
certain
general
character
or
key
to
make
a
volume
as
a
result
you
can
not
fully
know
or
estimate
his
work
by
one
book
or
two
books
or
even
half
a
dozen
you
must
possess
or
be
familiar
with
every
one
of
the
score
and
more
volumes
which
contain
his
output
of
poetry
before
you
can
realise
how
great
and
how
is
his
genius
it
is
a
common
remark
on
the
part
of
those
who
respond
readily
to
the
vigorous
work
of
kipling
or
masefield
even
our
own
service
that
bliss
carman
poetry
has
no
relation
to
or
concern
with
ordinary
everyday
life
one
would
suppose
that
most
persons
who
cared
for
poetry
at
all
turned
to
it
as
a
relief
from
or
counter
to
the
burdens
and
vexations
of
the
daily
round
but
in
any
event
the
remark
referred
to
seems
to
me
to
indicate
either
the
most
casual
acquaintance
with
carman
work
or
a
complete
misunderstanding
and
misapprehension
of
the
meaning
of
it
i
grant
that
you
will
find
little
or
nothing
in
it
all
to
remind
you
of
the
grim
realities
and
vexing
social
problems
of
this
modern
existence
of
ours
but
to
say
or
to
suggest
that
these
things
do
not
exist
for
carman
is
to
say
or
to
suggest
something
which
is
the
reverse
of
true
the
truth
is
he
is
aware
of
them
as
only
one
with
the
sensitive
organism
of
a
poet
can
be
but
he
does
not
feel
that
he
has
a
call
or
mission
to
remedy
them
and
still
less
to
sing
of
them
he
therefore
leaves
the
immediate
problems
of
the
day
to
those
who
choose
or
are
led
to
occupy
themselves
therewith
and
turns
resolutely
away
to
dwell
upon
those
things
which
for
him
possess
infinitely
greater
importance
what
are
they
one
who
knows
carman
only
as
say
a
lyrist
of
spring
or
as
a
singer
of
the
delights
of
vagabondia
probably
will
ask
in
some
wonder
well
the
things
which
concern
him
above
all
i
would
answer
are
first
and
naturally
the
beauty
and
wonder
of
this
world
of
ours
and
next
the
mystery
of
the
earthly
pilgrimage
of
the
human
soul
out
of
eternity
and
back
into
it
again
the
poems
in
the
present
volume
which
by
the
way
can
boast
the
high
honor
of
being
the
very
first
regular
canadian
edition
of
his
work
will
be
evidence
ample
and
conclusive
to
every
reader
i
am
sure
of
the
place
which
the
perennial
enchanted
lovely
world
and
all
its
lore
occupy
in
the
heart
and
soul
of
bliss
carman
as
well
as
of
the
magical
power
with
which
he
is
able
to
convey
the
deep
and
unfailing
satisfaction
and
delight
which
they
possess
for
him
they
however
represent
his
latest
period
he
has
had
three
periods
comprising
selections
from
three
of
his
last
published
volumes
rough
from
and
together
with
a
number
of
new
poems
and
do
not
show
except
here
and
there
and
by
hints
and
flashes
how
great
is
his
preoccupation
with
the
problem
of
man
existence
the
hidden
import
of
man
eternal
plight
this
is
manifest
most
in
certain
of
his
earlier
books
for
in
these
he
turns
and
returns
to
the
greatest
of
all
the
problems
of
man
almost
constantly
probing
with
consummate
and
almost
unrivalled
use
of
the
art
of
expression
for
the
secret
which
surely
he
clearly
feels
lies
hidden
somewhere
to
be
discovered
if
one
could
but
pierce
deeply
enough
pick
up
the
and
as
you
turn
over
page
after
page
you
can
not
but
observe
how
incessantly
the
poet
mind
like
the
minds
of
his
two
great
masters
browning
and
whitman
works
at
this
problem
in
behind
the
arras
the
title
poem
in
the
wings
the
crimson
house
the
lodger
beyond
the
gamut
the
juggler
yes
in
every
poem
in
the
book
he
takes
up
and
handles
the
strange
thing
we
know
as
or
call
life
turning
it
now
this
way
now
that
in
an
effort
to
find
out
its
meaning
and
purpose
he
comes
but
little
nearer
success
in
this
than
do
most
of
the
rest
of
men
of
course
but
the
magical
and
beauty
of
his
expression
the
haunting
melody
of
his
lines
the
variety
of
his
images
and
figures
and
the
depth
and
range
of
his
thought
put
his
searchings
and
ponderings
in
a
class
by
themselves
lengthy
quotation
from
carman
books
is
not
permitted
here
and
i
must
guide
myself
accordingly
though
with
reluctance
because
i
believe
that
in
a
study
such
as
this
the
subject
should
be
allowed
to
speak
for
himself
as
much
as
possible
in
behind
the
arras
the
poet
describes
the
passage
from
life
to
death
as
a
cadence
dying
down
unto
its
source
in
music
course
and
goes
on
to
speak
of
death
as
the
broken
rhythm
of
thought
and
man
the
sweep
and
span
of
memory
and
hope
about
the
orbit
where
they
still
must
grope
for
wider
scope
to
be
through
thousand
springs
restored
renewed
with
love
imbrued
with
increments
of
will
made
strong
perceiving
unattainment
still
from
each
new
skill
now
follow
some
verses
from
behind
the
gamut
to
my
mind
the
greatest
single
achievement
as
fine
sand
spread
on
a
disc
of
silver
at
some
chord
which
bids
the
motes
combine
heeding
the
hidden
and
reverberant
impulse
shifts
and
dances
into
curve
and
line
the
round
earth
too
haply
like
a
was
set
whirling
her
assigned
sure
way
round
this
little
orb
of
her
ecliptic
to
some
harmony
she
must
obey
and
what
of
man
linked
to
all
his
fellows
through
unfrontiered
provinces
to
range
man
is
but
the
morning
dream
of
nature
roused
to
some
wild
cadence
weird
and
strange
here
now
are
some
verses
from
pulvis
et
umbra
which
is
to
be
found
in
carman
first
book
tide
on
grand
and
in
which
the
poet
addresses
a
moth
which
a
storm
has
blown
into
his
window
for
man
walks
the
world
with
mourning
down
to
death
and
leaves
no
trace
with
the
dust
upon
his
forehead
and
the
shadow
on
his
face
pillared
dust
and
fleeing
shadow
as
the
roadside
wind
goes
by
and
the
fourscore
years
that
vanish
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
pillared
dust
and
fleeing
shadow
where
in
all
our
english
literature
will
one
find
the
life
history
of
man
summed
up
more
briefly
and
at
the
same
time
more
beautifully
than
in
that
wonderful
line
now
follows
a
companion
verse
to
those
just
quoted
taken
from
lord
of
my
heart
elation
which
stands
in
the
forefront
of
the
green
book
of
the
it
may
be
remarked
here
that
while
the
poet
recurs
again
and
again
to
some
favorite
thought
or
idea
it
is
never
in
the
same
words
his
expression
is
always
new
and
fresh
showing
how
deep
and
true
is
his
inspiration
again
it
is
man
who
is
pictured
a
fleet
and
shadowy
column
of
dust
and
mountain
rain
to
walk
the
earth
a
moment
and
be
dissolved
again
but
while
carman
speculations
upon
life
meaning
and
the
mystery
of
the
future
can
not
but
appeal
to
the
it
is
as
an
interpreter
of
nature
that
he
makes
his
widest
appeal
bliss
carman
i
must
say
here
and
emphatically
is
no
mere
he
never
or
scarcely
ever
paints
a
picture
of
nature
for
its
own
sake
he
goes
beyond
the
outward
aspect
of
things
and
interprets
or
translates
for
us
with
less
keen
senses
as
only
a
poet
whose
feeling
for
nature
is
of
the
deepest
and
profoundest
who
has
gone
to
her
and
been
taken
close
to
her
warm
bosom
can
do
is
this
not
evident
from
these
verses
from
the
great
return
originally
called
the
pagan
prayer
and
for
some
inscrutable
reason
to
be
found
only
in
the
limited
issued
in
two
stately
volumes
in
when
i
have
lifted
up
my
heart
to
thee
thou
hast
ever
hearkened
and
drawn
near
and
bowed
thy
shining
face
close
over
me
till
i
could
hear
thee
as
the
hear
when
i
have
cried
to
thee
in
lonely
need
being
but
a
child
of
thine
bereft
and
wrung
then
all
the
rivers
in
the
hills
gave
heed
and
the
great
in
thy
holy
tongue
that
ancient
incommunicable
speech
the
april
stars
and
autumn
sunsets
know
soothed
me
and
calmed
with
solace
beyond
reach
of
human
ken
mysterious
and
low
who
can
read
or
listen
to
those
moving
lines
without
feeling
that
carman
is
in
very
truth
a
poet
of
nature
nay
nature
own
poet
but
how
could
he
be
other
when
in
the
breath
of
the
reed
the
green
book
of
the
he
makes
the
appeal
make
me
thy
priest
o
mother
and
prophet
of
thy
mood
with
all
the
forest
wonder
enraptured
and
imbued
as
becomes
such
a
poet
and
particularly
a
poet
whose
is
april
carman
sings
much
of
the
early
spring
again
and
again
he
takes
up
his
woodland
pipe
and
lo
pan
himself
and
all
his
train
troop
joyously
before
us
yet
the
singer
notes
for
all
his
singing
never
become
wearied
or
strident
his
airs
are
ever
new
and
fresh
his
latest
songs
are
no
less
spontaneous
and
winning
than
were
his
first
written
how
many
years
ago
while
at
the
same
time
they
have
gained
in
beauty
and
melody
what
heart
will
not
stir
to
the
vibrant
music
of
his
immortal
spring
song
which
was
originally
published
in
the
first
from
and
the
opening
verses
of
which
follow
make
me
over
mother
april
when
the
sap
begins
to
stir
when
thy
flowery
hand
delivers
all
the
rivers
and
thy
great
heart
beats
and
quivers
to
revive
the
days
that
were
make
me
over
mother
april
when
the
sap
begins
to
stir
take
my
dust
and
all
my
dreaming
count
my
one
by
one
send
them
where
the
winters
perish
then
some
golden
noon
recherish
and
restore
them
in
the
sun
flower
and
scent
and
dust
and
dreaming
with
their
every
one
that
poem
is
sufficient
in
itself
to
prove
that
bliss
carman
has
full
right
and
title
to
be
called
spring
own
lyrist
though
it
may
be
remarked
here
that
not
all
his
spring
poems
are
so
unfeignedly
joyous
many
of
them
indeed
have
a
touch
or
more
than
a
touch
of
wistfulness
for
the
poet
knows
well
that
sorrow
lurks
under
all
joy
deep
and
well
hidden
though
it
may
be
carman
sings
equally
finely
though
perhaps
not
so
frequently
of
summer
and
the
other
seasons
but
as
he
has
other
claims
upon
our
attention
i
shall
forbear
to
labor
the
fact
particularly
as
the
following
collection
demonstrates
it
sufficiently
one
of
those
other
claims
is
as
a
writer
of
sea
poetry
few
poets
it
may
be
said
have
pictured
the
majesty
and
the
mystery
the
beauty
and
the
terror
of
the
sea
better
than
he
his
of
lost
is
a
veritable
for
those
whose
spirits
find
kinship
in
wide
expanses
of
moving
waters
one
of
the
best
known
poems
in
this
volume
is
the
gravedigger
which
opens
thus
oh
the
shambling
sea
is
a
sexton
old
and
well
his
work
is
done
with
an
equal
grave
for
lord
and
knave
he
buries
them
every
one
then
hoy
and
rip
with
a
rolling
hip
he
makes
for
the
nearest
shore
and
god
who
sent
him
a
thousand
ship
will
send
him
a
thousand
more
but
some
he
save
for
a
bleaching
grave
and
shoulder
them
in
to
shore
shoulder
them
in
shoulder
them
in
shoulder
them
in
to
shore
in
the
city
of
the
sea
songs
from
carman
speaks
of
the
seabells
sounding
the
eternal
cadence
of
sea
sorrow
for
man
lot
and
immemorial
wrong
the
lost
strains
that
haunt
the
human
dwelling
with
the
ghost
of
song
elsewhere
he
speaks
of
the
great
sea
mystic
and
musical
and
here
from
another
poem
is
a
striking
picture
the
old
sea
seems
to
whimper
and
deplore
mourning
like
a
childless
crone
with
her
sorrow
left
alone
the
eternal
human
cry
to
the
heedless
i
have
said
above
that
carman
has
had
three
distinct
periods
and
intimated
that
the
poems
in
the
following
collection
are
of
his
third
period
the
first
period
may
be
said
to
be
represented
by
the
and
the
volumes
while
the
second
is
displayed
in
the
three
volumes
of
from
which
he
published
in
association
with
his
friend
richard
hovey
bliss
carman
was
from
the
first
too
original
and
individual
a
poet
to
be
directly
influenced
by
anyone
else
but
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
his
friendship
with
hovey
helped
to
turn
him
from
with
mysteries
which
for
all
their
greatness
are
not
for
man
to
solve
to
an
intenser
realisation
of
the
beauty
and
loveliness
of
the
world
about
him
and
of
the
joys
of
human
fellowship
the
result
is
seen
in
such
poems
as
spring
song
quoted
in
part
above
and
his
perhaps
equally
the
joys
of
the
road
which
appeared
in
the
same
volume
with
that
poem
and
a
few
verses
from
which
follow
now
the
joys
of
the
road
are
chiefly
these
a
crimson
touch
on
the
hardwood
trees
a
vagrant
morning
wide
and
blue
in
early
fall
when
the
wind
walks
too
a
shadowy
highway
cool
and
brown
alluring
up
and
enticing
down
from
rippled
waters
and
dappled
swamp
from
purple
glory
to
scarlet
pomp
the
outward
eye
the
quiet
will
and
the
striding
heart
from
hill
to
hill
some
of
the
finest
of
carman
work
is
contained
in
his
elegiac
or
memorial
poems
in
which
he
commemorates
keats
shelley
william
blake
lincoln
stevenson
and
other
men
for
whom
he
has
a
kindred
feeling
and
also
friends
whom
he
has
loved
and
lost
listen
to
these
moving
lines
from
non
omnis
moriar
written
in
memory
of
gleeson
white
and
to
be
found
in
songs
from
there
is
a
part
of
me
that
knows
beneath
incertitude
and
fear
i
shall
not
perish
when
i
pass
beyond
mortality
frontier
but
greatly
having
joyed
and
grieved
greatly
content
shall
hear
the
sigh
of
the
strange
wind
across
the
lone
bright
lands
of
taciturnity
in
patience
therefore
i
await
my
friend
unchanged
benign
regard
some
april
when
i
too
shall
be
spilt
water
from
a
broken
shard
in
the
white
gull
written
for
the
centenary
of
the
birth
of
shelley

included
in

thus
apostrophizes

thee
for

thy
lips
have
set
the
hail
and
haste
of
clarions
free
to
bugle
down
the
wintry
verge
of
time
forever
where
the
surge
thunders
and
trembles
on
a
waste
and
open
sea
in
a

a
threnody
for
robert
louis
stevenson
which
appears
in
the
same
volume
the
poet

of
whose
tribe
he
may
be
said
to
be
truly
one
as
the
master
of
the
roving
kind
and
goes

all

the

of

it
may
be
said
without

is
bliss
carman
himself
no
summary
of
carman
work
however
cursory
would
be
worthy
of
the
name
if
it
omitted
mention
of
his
ventures
in
the
realm
of
greek
myth
the
book
of
is
made
up
of
work
of
that
sort
every
poem
in
it
being
full
of
the
beauty
of
phrase
and
melody
of
which
carman
alone
has
the
secret
the
finest
poems
in
the
book
barring
the
opening
one
overlord
are
daphne
the
dead
faun
hylas
and
at
phædra
tomb
but
i
can
do
no
more
here
than
name
them
for
extracts
would
fail
to
reveal
their
full
beauty
and
beauty
after
all
is
said
is
the
first
and
last
thing
with
carman
as
he
says
himself
somewhere
the
joy
of
the
hand
that
hews
for
beauty
is
the
dearest
solace
under
the
sun
and
again
the
eternal
slaves
of
beauty
are
the
masters
of
the
world
a
slave
a
happy
willing
slave
to
beauty
is
the
poet
himself
and
the
world
can
never
repay
him
for
the
message
of
beauty
which
he
has
brought
it
kindred
to
the
book
of
but
much
more
important
is
one
hundred
one
of
the
most
successful
of
the
numerous
attempts
which
have
been
made
to
recapture
the
poems
by
that
high
priestess
of
song
which
remain
to
us
only
in
fragments
carman
as
charles
roberts
points
out
in
an
introduction
to
the
volume
has
made
no
attempt
here
at
translation
or
paraphrasing
his
venture
has
been
the
most
perilous
and
most
alluring
in
the
whole
field
of
poetry
that
of
imaginative
and
at
the
same
time
interpretive
construction
brief
quotation
again
would
fail
to
convey
an
adequate
idea
of
the
exquisiteness
of
the
work
and
all
i
can
do
therefore
is
to
urge
all
lovers
of
real
poetry
to
possess
themselves
of
one
hundred
for
it
is
literally
a
storehouse
of
lyric
beauty
i
must
not
fail
here
to
speak
of
the
book
of
which
contains
some
lovely
things
notably
at
the
great
release
this
is
not
only
one
of
the
finest
of
all
carman
poems
but
it
is
also
one
of
the
finest
poems
of
our
time
it
is
a
love
poem
and
no
one
possessing
any
real
feeling
for
poetry
can
read
it
without
experiencing
that
strange
thrill
of
the
spirit
which
only
the
highest
form
of
poetry
can
communicate
morning
and
evening
in
an
iris
meadow
and
a
letter
from
lesbos
must
be
also
mentioned
in
the
last
named
poem
sappho
is
represented
as
writing
to
gorgo
and
expresses
herself
in
these
moving
words
if
the
high
gods
in
that
triumphant
time
have
calendared
no
day
for
thee
to
come
to
this
doorway
as
of
old
unmoved
i
shall
behold
their
pomps
go
by
the
painted
seasons
in
their
pageantry
the
silvery
progressions
of
the
moon
and
all
their
infinite
ardors
unsubdued
pass
with
the
wind
replenishing
the
earth
incredulous
forever
i
must
live
and
once
thy
lover
without
joy
behold
the
gradual
uncounted
years
go
by
sharing
the
bitterness
of
all
things
made
mention
must
be
now
made
of
of
the
sea
which
can
be
described
only
as
a
collection
of
the
sweetest
and
tenderest
love
lyrics
written
in
our
time
the
lyric
songs
the
earthborn
children
sing
when
laughter
throngs
the
shy
of
spring
when
there
not
a
joy
of
the
heart
but
flies
like
a
flag
unfurled
and
the
swelling
buds
bring
back
the
april
of
the
world
so
perfect
and
complete
are
these
lyrics
that
it
would
be
almost
sacrilege
to
quote
any
of
them
unless
entire
listen
however
to
these
verses
the
day
is
lost
without
thee
the
night
has
not
a
star
thy
going
is
an
empty
room
whose
door
is
left
ajar
depart
it
is
the
footfall
of
twilight
on
the
hills
return
and
every
rood
of
ground
breaks
into
daffodils
there
are
those
who
will
have
it
that
bliss
carman
has
been
away
from
canada
so
long
that
he
has
ceased
to
be
in
a
real
sense
a
canadian
such
assume
rather
than
know
for
a
very
little
study
of
his
work
would
show
them
that
it
is
shot
through
and
through
with
the
poet
feeling
for
the
land
of
his
birth
memories
of
his
childhood
and
youthful
years
down
by
the
sea
are
still
fresh
in
carman
mind
and
inspire
him
again
and
again
in
his
writing
a
remembrance
at
the
beginning
of
the
present
collection
may
be
pointed
to
as
a
striking
instance
of
this
but
proof
positive
is
the
volume
from
a
northern
for
it
could
have
been
written
only
by
a
canadian
born
and
bred
one
whose
heart
and
soul
thrill
to
the
thought
of
canada
i
would
single
out
from
this
volume
for
special
mention
as
being
canadian
in
the
fullest
sense
in
a
grand
pré
garden
the
keeper
silence
at
home
and
abroad
killoleet
and
above
the
gaspereau
but
have
no
space
to
quote
from
them
but
carman
is
not
only
a
canadian
he
is
also
a
briton
and
evidence
of
this
is
his
on
the
written
on
the
occasion
of
the
crowning
of
king
edward
vii
in
this
poem
the
very
existence
of
which
is
hardly
known
among
us
ought
to
be
put
in
the
hands
of
every
child
and
youth
who
speaks
the
english
tongue
for
no
other
i
dare
maintain
nothing
by
kipling
or
newbolt
or
any
other
of
our
imperial
singers
expresses
more
truly
and
more
movingly
the
deep
feeling
of
love
and
reverence
which
the
very
thought
of
england
evokes
in
every
son
of
hers
even
though
it
may
never
have
been
his
to
see
her
white
cliffs
rise
or
to
tread
her
storied
ground
o
england
little
mother
by
the
sleepless
northern
tide
having
bred
so
many
nations
to
devotion
trust
and
pride
very
tenderly
we
turn
with
welling
hearts
that
yearn
still
to
love
you
and
defend
you
let
the
sons
of
men
discern
wherein
your
right
and
title
might
and
majesty
reside
in
concluding
this
i
greatly
fear
lamentably
inadequate
study
i
come
to
the
collection
which
follows
and
which
as
intimated
above
represents
the
work
of
carman
latest
period
i
must
say
at
once
that
while
i
yield
to
no
one
in
admiration
for
and
the
other
books
of
that
period
or
for
the
work
of
the
second
period
as
represented
by
the
from
volumes
i
have
no
hesitation
in
declaring
that
i
regard
the
poet
work
of
the
past
few
years
with
even
higher
admiration
it
may
not
possess
the
force
and
vigor
of
the
work
which
preceded
it
but
anything
seemingly
missing
in
that
respect
is
more
than
made
up
for
me
by
increased
beauty
and
clarity
of
expression
the
mysticism
verging
or
more
than
verging
at
times
on
symbolism
which
marked
his
earlier
poems
and
which
hung
as
it
were
as
a
veil
between
them
and
the
reader
has
gone
and
the
poet
thought
or
theme
now
lies
clearly
before
us
as
in
a
mirror
what
to
take
a
verse
from
the
following
pages
at
random
could
be
more
pellucid
more
crystal
clear
in
expression
what
indeed
could
come
closer
to
that
achieving
of
the
impossible
at
which
every
real
poet
must
aim
than

should

the
world
is
all
of
lacquered
gold
expectant
as
a
dream
the
poet
happily
has
fully
recovered
from
the
serious
illness
which
laid
him
low
some
two
years
ago
and
which
for
a
time
caused
his
friends
and
admirers
the
gravest
concern
and
so
we
may
look
forward
hopefully
to
seeing
further
volumes
of
verse
come
from
the
press
to
make
certain

fame

for

him
not
but
as
i
trod
by
rocky
ledge
through
woods
untamed
just
where
one
scarlet
lily
flamed
i
saw
his
footprint
in
the
suddenly
all
unaware
far
off
in
the
deep
shadows
where
a
solitary
hermit
thrush
sang
through
the
holy
twilight
hush
i
heard
his
voice
upon
the
even
as
i
marvelled
how
god
gives
us
heaven
here
and
now
in
a
stir
of
wind
that
hardly
shook
the
poplar
leaves
beside
the
brook
his
hand
was
light
upon
my
last
with
evening
as
i
turned
homeward
and
thought
what
i
had
learned
and
all
that
there
was
still
to
probe
i
caught
the
glory
of
his
robe
where
the
last
fires
of
sunset
to
the
world
with
quickening
start
i
looked
and
longed
for
any
part
in
making

beauty

from
that
kindling
ecstasy
i
knew
god
dwelt

a
remembrance
here
in

england
when
summer
is
come
a
flutters
a
page
of
remembrance
in
the
volume
of
long
ago
soft
is
the
wind
over
grand

stirring
the

breath
of

the

sorrow
beautiful
solemn
and
slow

spreading
her
old
enchantment

tender
ineffable
wonder

should
my
heart
not
know

i

brig
and
gallant
barkentine
to
little
fundy
fishing
boats
with
gunwales
painted
green
they
used
to
go
on
trading
trips
around
the
world
for
me
for
though
i
had
to
stay
on
shore
my
heart
was
on
the
sea
they
stopped
at
every
port
to
call
from
babylon
to
rome
to
load
with
all
the
lovely
things
we
never
had
at
home
with
elephants
and
ivory
bought
from
the
king
of
tyre
and
shells
and
silk
and
that
sailor
men
admire
with
figs
and
dates
from
samarcand
and
squatty
and
scented
silver
amulets
from
indian
bazaars
with
from
port
of
spain
and
monkeys
from
ceylon
and
paper
lanterns
from
pekin
with
painted
dragons
on
with
cocoanuts
from
zanzibar
and
pines
from
singapore
and
when
they
had
unloaded
these
they
could
go
back
for
more
and
even
after
i
was
big
and
had
to
go
to
school
my
mind
was
often
far
away
aboard
the
ships
of
yule
the
ships
of
saint
john
where
are
the
ships
i
used
to
know
that
came
to
port
on
the
fundy
tide
half
a
century
ago
in
beauty
and
stately
pride
in
they
would
come
past
the
beacon
light
with
the
sun
on
gleaming
sail
and
spar
folding
their
wings
like
birds
in
flight
from
countries
strange
and
far
schooner
and
brig
and
barkentine
i
watched
them
slow
as
the
sails
were
furled
and
wondered
what
cities
they
must
have
seen
on
the
other
side
of
the
world
frenchman
and
britisher
and
dane
yankee
spaniard
and
portugee
and
many
a
home
ship
back
again
with
her
stories
of
the
sea
calm
and
victorious
at
rest
from
the
relentless
rough
the
wild
duck
on
the
river
breast
was
not
more
sure
than
they
the
creatures
of
a
passing
race
the
dark
spruce
forests
made
them
strong
the
sea
lore
gave
them
magic
grace
the
great
winds
taught
them
song
and
god
endowed
them
each
with
life
his
blessing
on
the
craftsman
skill
to
meet
the
blind
unreasoned
strife
and
dare
the
risk
of
not
mere
insensate
wood
and
paint
obedient
to
the
helm
command
but
often
restive
as
a
saint
beneath
the
heavenly
hand
all
the
beauty
and
mystery
of
life
were
there
adventure
bold
youth
and
the
glamour
of
the
sea
and
all
its
sorrows
old
and
many
a
time
i
saw
them
go
out
on
the
flood
at
morning
brave
as
the
little
tugs
had
them
in
tow
and
the
sunlight
danced
on
the
wave
there
all
day
long
you
could
hear
the
sound
of
the
caulking
iron
the
ship
bronze
bell
and
the
clank
of
the
capstan
going
round
as
the
great
tides
rose
and
fell
the
sailors
songs
the
captain
shout
the
boatswain
whistle
piping
shrill
and
the
roar
as
the
anchor
chain
runs
out
i
often
hear
them
still
i
can
see
them
still
the
sun
on
their
gear
the
shining
streak
as
the
hulls
careen
and
the
flag
at
the
peak
unfurling
clear
as
a
picture
on
a
screen
the
fog
still
hangs
on
the
long
the
gulls
go
wavering
to
and
fro
but
where
are
all
the
beautiful
ships
i
knew
so
long
ago
the
garden
of
dreams
my
heart
is
a
garden
of
dreams
where
you
walk
when
day
is
done
fair
as
the
royal
flowers
calm
as
the
lingering
sun
never
a
drouth
comes
there
nor
any
frost
that
mars
only
the
wind
of
love
under
the
early
stars
the
living
breath
that
moves
whispering
to
and
fro
like
the
voice
of
god
in
the
dusk
of
the
garden
long
ago
garden
magic
within
my
garden
i
see
her
standing
now
uplifted
in
the
twilight
with
glory
on
her
brow
i
love
to
walk
at
evening
and
watch
when
winds
are
low
the
new
moon
in
the
because
she
loved
it
so
and
there
entranced
i
listen
while
flowers
and
winds
confer
and
all
their
conversation
is
redolent
of
her
i
love
the
trees
that
guard
it
upstanding
and
serene
so
noble
so
undaunted
because
that
was
her
mien
i
love
the
brook
that
bounds
it
because
its
silver
voice
is
like
her
bubbling
laughter
that
made
the
world
rejoice
i
love
the
golden
jonquils
because
she
used
to
say
if
soul
could
choose
a
color
it
would
be
clothed
as
they
i
love
the
iris
because
her
eyes
were
blue
and
in
meaning
and
in
hue
i
love
the
small
wild
roses
because
she
used
to
stand
adoringly
above
them
and
bless
them
with
her
hand
these
were
her
boon
companions
but
more
than
all
the
rest
i
love
the
april
lilac
because
she
loved
it
best
soul
of
undying
rapture
how
love
enchantment
clings
with
sorcery
and
fragrance
about
familiar
things
in
gold
lacquer
gold
are
the
great
trees
overhead
and
gold
the
grass
as
though
a
cloth
of
gold
were
spread
to
let
a
seraph
pass
and
where
the
pageant
should
go
by
meadow
and
wood
and
stream
the
world
is
all
of
lacquered
gold
expectant
as
a
dream
against
the
sunset
burning
gold
etched
in
dark
monotone
behind
its
alley
of
grey
trees
and
gateposts
of
grey
stone
stands
the
old
manse
about
whose
eaves
an
air
of
mystery
clings
abandoned
to
the
lonely
peace
of
bygone
ghostly
things
in
molten
gold
the
river
winds
with
languid
sweep
and
turn
beside
the
wooded
hill
yellowed
with
ash
and
fern
the
streets
are
tiled
with
shade
and
arched
with
fretted
gold
ecstatic
aisles
that
richly
thread
this
minster
grim
and
old
the
air
is
flecked
with
filtered
gold
the
shimmer
of
romance
whose
ageless
glamour
still
must
hold
the
world
as
in
a
trance
pouring
every
time
and
place
light
of
an
amber
sea
the
spell
of
all
the
gladsome
things
that
have
been
or
shall
be
aprilian
when
april
came
with
sunshine
and
showers
and
lilac
bloom
my
heart
with
sudden
gladness
was
like
a
fragrant
room
her
eyes
were
heaven
own
azure
as
deep
as
god
own
truth
her
soul
was
made
of
rapture
and
mystery
and
youth
she
knew
the
sorry
burden
of
all
the
ancient
years
yet
could
not
dwell
with
sadness
and
memory
and
tears
with
her
there
was
no
shadow
of
failure
nor
despair
but
only
loving
joyance
o
heart
how
glad
we
were
garden
shadows
when
the
dawn
winds
whisper
to
the
standing
corn
and
the
rose
of
morning
from
the
dark
is
born
all
my
shadowy
garden
seems
to
grow
aware
of
a
fragrant
presence
half
expected
there
in
the
golden
shimmer
of
the
burning
noon
when
the
birds
are
silent
and
the
poppies
swoon
once
more
i
behold
her
smile
and
turn
her
face
with
its
infinite
regard
its
immortal
grace
when
the
twilight
silvers
every
nodding
flower
and
the
new
moon
hallows
the
first
evening
hour
is
it
not
her
footfall
down
the
garden
walks
where
the
drowsy
blossoms
slumber
on
their
stalks
in
the
starry
quiet
when
the
soul
is
free
and
a
vernal
message
stirs
the
lilac
tree
surely
i
have
felt
her
pass
and
brush
my
cheek
with
the
eloquence
of
love
that
does
not
need
to
speak
in
the
day
of
battle
in
the
day
of
battle
in
the
night
of
dread
let
one
hymn
be
lifted
let
one
prayer
be
said
not
for
pride
of
conquest
not
for
vengeance
wrought
nor
for
peace
and
safety
with
dishonour
bought
praise
for
faith
in
freedom
our
fighting
fathers
stay
born
of
dreams
and
daring

for
cloudless

valiant

that
the

may
triumph
to
the

darkly

mused
predestined
to

reckoned

gentle

gospel
appointed
to
govern
a
world
of
men
till
love
has
died
and
the
echoes
have
whispered
the
last
amen
a
fireside
vision
once
i
walked
the
world
enchanted
through
the
scented
woods
of
spring
hand
in
hand
with
love
in
rapture
just
to
hear
a
bluebird
sing
now
the
lonely
winds
of
autumn
moan
about
my
gusty
eaves
as
i
sit
beside
the
fire
listening
to
the
flying
leaves
as
the
dying
embers
settle
and
the
twilight
falls
apace
through
the
gloom
i
see
a
vision
full
of
ardor
full
of
grace
when
the
architect
of
beauty
breathed
the
lyric
soul
in
man
lo
the
being
that
he
fashioned
was
of
such
a
mould
and
plan
bravely
through
the
deepening
shadows
moves
that
figure
half
divine
with
its
tenderness
of
bearing
with
its
dignity
of
line
eyes
more
wonderful
than
evening
with
the
new
moon
on
the
hill
mouth
with
traces
of
god
humor
in
its
corners
lurking
still
ah
she
smiles
in
recollection
lays
a
hand
upon
my
brow
rests
this
head
upon
love
bosom
surely
it
is
april
now
a
water
color
there
a
picture
in
my
room
lightens
many
an
hour
of
gloom
cheers
me
under
fortune
frown
and
the
drudgery
of
town
many
and
many
a
winter
day
when
my
soul
sees
all
things
gray
here
is
veritable
june
heart
content
and
spirit
boon
it
is
scarce
a
wide
not
a
span
from
side
to
side
yet
it
is
an
open
door
looking
back
to
joy
once
more
where
the
level
marshes
lie
a
quiet
journey
of
the
eye
and
the
unsubstantial
blue
makes
the
fine
illusion
true
so
i
forth
and
travel
there
in
the
blessed
light
and
air
miles
of
green
tranquillity
down
the
river
to
the
sea
here
the
roam
at
will
and
the
on
the
hill
brings
the
hollow
pebbly
roar
from
the
dim
and
rosy
shore
with
the
very
scent
and
draft
of
the
old
sea
mighty
craft
i
am
standing
on
the
dunes
by
some
charm
that
must
be
june
when
the
magic
of
her
hand
lays
a
on
the
land
and
the
old
enchantment
falls
on
the
orchard
walls
and
the
purple
boles
while
the
orange
orioles
flame
and
whistle
through
the
green
of
that
paradisal
scene
strolling
idly
for
an
hour
where
the
elder
is
in
flower
i
can
hear
the
call
down
beyond
the
pasture
wall
musing
in
the
scented
heat
where
the
bayberry
is
sweet
i
can
see
the
shadows
run
up
the
in
the
sun
or
i
cross
the
bridge
and
reach
the
mossers
houses
on
the
beach
where
the
bathers
on
the
sand
lie
and
thus
i
pass
the
gates
of
time
and
the
boundaries
of
clime
change
the
ugly
street
for
god
country
green
and
sweet
fag
of
body
irk
of
mind
in
a
moment
left
behind
once
more
i
possess
my
soul
with
the
poise
and
beauty
gives
the
free
of
heart
through
the
sorcery
of
art
threnody
for
a
poet
not
in
the
ancient
abbey
nor
in
the
city
ground
not
in
the
lonely
mountains
nor
in
the
blue
profound
lay
him
to
rest
when
his
time
is
come
and
the
smiling
mortal
lips
are
dumb
but
here
in
the
decent
quiet
under
the
whispering
pines
where
the
dogwood
breaks
in
blossom
and
the
peaceful
sunlight
shines
where
wild
birds
sing
and
ferns
unfold
when
spring
comes
back
in
her
green
and
gold
and
when
that
mortal
likeness
has
been
dissolved
by
fire
say
not
above
the
ashes
here
ends
a
man
desire
for
every
year
when
the
bluebirds
sing
he
shall
be
part
of
the
lyric
spring
then
lovers
shall
hear
in
wind
and
rain
the
cadence
of
his
music
the
rhythm
of
his
refrain
for
he
was
a
blade
of
the
april
sod
that
bowed
and
blew
with
the
whisper
of
god
dust
of
the
street
this
cosmic
dust
beneath
our
feet
rising
to
hurry
down
the
street
borne
by
the
wind
and
blown
astray
in
its
erratic
senseless
way
is
the
same
stuff
as
you
and
i
with
knowledge
and
desire
put
by
thousands
of
times
since
time
began
it
has
been
used
for
making
man
freighted
like
us
with
every
sense
of
spirit
and
intelligence
to
walk
the
world
and
know
the
fine
large
consciousness
of
things
divine
these
wandering
atoms
in
their
day
perhaps
have
passed
this
very
way
with
eager
step
and
flowerlike
face
with
lovely
ardor
poise
and
grace
on
what
delightful
errands
bent
passionate
generous
and
intent
an
angel
still
though
veiled
and
gloved
made
to
love
us
and
to
be
loved
friends
when
the
summons
comes
for
me
to
turn
my
back
reluctantly
on
this
delightful
play
i
claim
only
one
thing
in
friendship
name
and
you
will
not
decline
a
task
so
slight
when
it
is
all
i
ask
scatter
my
ashes
in
the
street
where
avenue
and
crossway
meet
i
beg
you
of
your
charity
no
granite
and
cement
for
me
to
needlessly
perpetuate
an
unimportant
name
and
date
others
may
wish
to
lay
them
down
on
some
fair
hillside
far
from
town
where
slim
white
birches
wave
and
gleam
beside
a
shadowy
woodland
stream
or
in
luxurious
beds
of
fern
but
i
would
have
my
dust
return
to
the
one
place
it
loved
the
best
in
days
when
it
was
happiest
to
a
young
lady
on
her
birthday
the
marching
years
go
by
and
brush
your
garment
hem
the
bandits
by
and
by
will
bid
you
go
with
them
trust
not
that
caravan
old
vagabonds
are
they
they
rob
you
if
they
can
and
make
believe
it
play
make
the
old
robbers
give
of
all
the
spoils
they
bear
their
truth
to
help
you
live
their
joy
to
keep
you
fair
ask
not
for
gauds
nor
gold
nor
fame
that
falsely
rings
the
foolish
world
grows
old
caring
for
all
these
things
make
all
your
sweet
demands
for
happiness
alone
and
the
years
will
fill
your
hands
with
treasures
rarely
known
the
gift
i
said
to
life
how
comes
it
with
all
this
wealth
in
store
of
beauty
joy
and
knowledge
thy
cry
is
still
for
more
count
all
the
years
of
striving
to
make
thy
burden
less
the
things
designed
and
fashioned
to
gladden
thy
success
the
treasures
sought
and
gathered
thy
lightest
whim
to
please
the
loot
of
all
the
ages
the
spoil
of
all
the
seas
is
there
no
end
of
labor
no
limit
to
thy
need
must
man
go
bowed
forever
in
bondage
to
thy
greed
with
tears
of
pride
and
passion
she
answered
god
above
i
only
wait
the
asking
to
spend
it
all
for
love
the
cry
of
the
hillborn
i
am
homesick
for
the
mountains
my
heroic
mother
hills
and
the
longing
that
is
on
me
no
solace
ever
stills
i
would
climb
to
brooding
summits
with
their
old
untarnished
dreams
cool
my
heart
in
forest
shadows
to
the
lull
of
falling
streams
hear
the
innocence
of
aspens
that
babble
in
the
breeze
and
the
fragrant
sudden
showers
that
patter
on
the
trees
i
am
lonely
for
my
thrushes
in
their
hermitage
withdrawn
toning
the
quiet
transports
of
twilight
and
of
dawn
i
need
the
pure
strong
mornings
when
the
soul
of
day
is
still
with
the
touch
of
frost
that
kindles
the
scarlet
on
the
hill
lone
trails
and
winding
woodroads
to
outlooks
wild
and
high
and
the
pale
moon
waiting
sundown
where
ledges
cut
the
sky
i
dream
of
upland
clearings
where
cones
of
sumac
burn
and
gaunt
and
boulders
lie
deep
in
beds
of
fern
the
gray
and
mottled
beeches
the
birches
satin
sheen
the
majesty
of
hemlocks
crowning
the
blue
ravine
my
eyes
dim
for
the
skyline
where
purple
peaks
aspire
and
the
forges
of
the
sunset
flare
up
in
golden
fire
there
crests
look
down
unheeding
and
see
the
great
winds
blow
tossing
the
huddled
in
gorges
far
below
where
from
the
warm
earth
roll
up
about
their
knees
and
hang
their
filmy
tatters
like
prayers
upon
the
trees
i
cry
for
shadows
on
plain
and
hill
and
dome
the
spell
of
old
enchantments
the
sorcery
of
home
a
mountain
gateway
i
know
a
vale
where
i
would
go
one
day
when
june
comes
back
and
all
the
world
once
more
is
glad
with
summer
deep
in
shade
it
lies
a
mighty
cleft
between
the
bosoming
hills
a
cool
dim
gateway
to
the
mountains
heart
on
either
side
the
wooded
slopes
come
down
hemlock
and
beech
and
chestnut
here
and
there
through
the
deep
forest
laurel
spreads
and
gleams
as
daphne
in
her
loveliness
among
the
sunlit
shadows
i
can
see
that
still
perfection
from
the
world
withdrawn
as
if
the
had
arrested
there
immortal
beauty
in
her
breathless
flight
the
road
winds
in
from
the
broad
luring
the
happy
traveller
turn
by
turn
up
to
the
lofty
mountains
of
the
sky
and
as
he
marches
with
uplifted
face
far
overhead
against
the
arching
blue
gray
ledges
overhang
from
dizzy
heights
scarred
by
a
thousand
winters
and
untamed
and
where
the
road
runs
in
the
valley
foot
through
the
dark
woods
a
mountain
stream
comes
down
singing
and
dancing
all
its
youth
away
among
the
boulders
and
the
shallow
runs
where
sunbeams
pierce
and
mossy
tree
trunks
hang
drenched
all
day
long
with
murmuring
sound
and
spray
there
light
of
heart
and
footfree
i
would
go
up
to
my
home
among
the
lasting
hills
nearing
the
day
end
i
would
leave
the
road
turn
to
the
left
and
take
the
steeper
trail
that
climbs
among
the
hemlocks
and
at
last
in
my
own
cabin
doorway
sit
me
down
companioned
in
that
leafy
solitude
by
the
wood
ghosts
of
twilight
and
of
peace
while
evening
passes
to
absolve
the
day
and
leave
the
tranquil
mountains
to
the
stars
and
in
that
sweet
seclusion
i
should
hear
among
the
beeches
in
the
dusk
the
thrushes
at
their
twilight
hymn
so
undistraught
so
rapturous
so
pure
they
well
might
be
in
wisdom
and
in
joy
the
seraphs
singing
at
the
birth
of
time
the
unworn
ritual
of
eternal
things
morning
in
the
hills
how
quiet
is
the
morning
in
the
hills
the
stealthy
shadows
of
the
summer
clouds
trail
through
the
cañon
and
the
mountain
stream
sounds
his
sonorous
music
far
below
in
the
cove
hemlock
and
aspen
chestnut
beech
and
fir
go
tiering
down
from
crest
and
ledge
while
in
the
hollows
of
the
dark
ravine
see
the
red
road
emerge
then
disappear
towards
the
wide
plain
and
fertile
valley
lands
my
forest
cabin
up
the
glen
is
solitary
save
for
one
wise
thrush
the
sound
of
falling
water
and
the
wind
mysteriously
conversing
with
the
leaves
here
i
abide
unvisited
by
doubt
dreaming
of
turmoil
and
despair
the
race
of
men
and
love
and
fleeting
time
what
life
may
be
or
beauty
caught
and
held
for
a
brief
moment
at
eternal
poise
what
impulse
now
shall
quicken
and
make
live
this
outward
semblance
and
this
inward
self
one
breath
of
being
fills
the
bubble
world
colored
and
frail
with
fleeting
change
on
change
surely
some
god
contrived
so
fair
a
thing
in
a
vast
leisure
of
uncounted
days
and
touched
it
with
the
breath
of
living
joy
wondrous
and
fair
and
wise
it
must
be
so
a
at
evening
and
at
morning
by
an
enchanted
way
i
walk
the
world
in
wonder
and
have
no
word
to
say
it
is
the
path
we
traversed
one
twilight
thou
and
i
thy
beauty
all
a
rapture
my
spirit
all
a
cry
the
red
leaves
fall
upon
it
the
moon
and
mist
and
rain
but
not
the
magic
footfall
that
made
its
meaning
plain
weather
of
the
soul
there
is
a
world
of
being
we
range
from
pole
to
pole
through
seasons
of
the
spirit
and
weather
of
the
soul
it
has
its
aprils
with
gladness
in
the
air
its
golden
junes
of
rapture
its
winters
of
despair
and
in
its
tranquil
autumns
we
halt
to
our
tattered
scarlet
pennons
with
valor
and
resource
from
undiscovered
regions
only
the
angels
know
great
winds
of
aspiration
perpetually
blow
to
free
the
sap
of
impulse
from
torpor
of
distrust
and
into
flowers
of
joyance
quicken
the
sentient
dust
from
nowhere
of
a
sudden
loom
sudden
clouds
of
fault
with
thunders
of
oppression
and
lightnings
of
revolt
with
hush
of
apprehension
and
quaking
of
the
heart
there
breed
the
storms
of
anger
and
floods
of
sorrow
start
and
there
shall
fall
how
gently
to
make
them
fertile
yet
the
rain
of
absolution
on
acres
of
regret
till
snows
of
mercy
cover
the
dream
that
shall
come
true
when
time
makes
all
things
wondrous
and
life
makes
all
things
new
here
and
now
where
is
heaven
is
it
not
just
a
friendly
garden
plot
walled
with
stone
and
roofed
with
sun
where
the
days
pass
one
by
one
not
too
fast
and
not
too
slow
looking
backward
as
they
go
at
the
beauties
left
behind
to
transport
the
pensive
mind
is
it
not
a
greening
ground
with
a
river
for
its
bound
and
a
to
prolong
fragrant
twilights
with
his
song
when
the
peonies
in
june
wait
the
rising
of
the
moon
and
the
music
of
the
stream
voices
its
immortal
dream
there
each
morning
will
renew
the
miracle
of
light
and
dew
and
the
soul
may
joy
to
praise
the
lord
of
roses
and
of
days
there
the
caravan
of
noon
halts
to
hear
the
cricket
tune
fifing
there
for
all
who
pass
the
anthem
of
the
summer
grass
does
not
heaven
begin
that
day
when
the
eager
heart
can
say
surely
god
is
in
this
place
i
have
seen
him
face
to
face
in
the
loveliness
of
flowers
in
the
service
of
the
showers
and
his
voice
has
talked
to
me
in
the
sunlit
apple
tree
i
can
feel
him
in
my
heart
when
the
tears
of
knowledge
start
for
another
joy
or
woe
where
the
lonely
soul
must
go
yea
i
learned
his
very
look
when
we
walked
beside
the
brook
and
you
smiled
and
touched
my
hand
god
is
love
i
understand
the
angel
of
joy
there
is
no
grief
for
me
nor
sadness
any
more
for
since
i
first
knew
thee
great
joy
has
kept
my
door
that
angel
of
the
calm
smile
no
menace
can
dismay
no
falsity
beguile
out
of
the
house
of
life
before
him
fled
away
languor
regret
and
strife
and
sorrow
on
that
day
grim
fear
unmanly
doubt
and
impotent
despair
went
at
his
bidding
forth
among
the
things
that
were
leaving
a
place
all
clean
resounding
of
the
sea
and
decked
with
forest
green
to
be
a
home
for
thee
the
homestead
here
we
came
when
love
was
young
now
that
love
is
old
shall
we
leave
the
floor
unswept
and
the
hearth
acold
here
the
in
the
dusk
wandering
to
and
fro
moves
the
moonflowers
like
a
ghost
of
the
long
ago
here
from
every
doorway
looks
a
remembered
face
every
sill
and
panel
wears
a
familiar
grace
let
the
windows
smile
again
to
the
morning
light
and
the
door
stand
open
wide
when
the
moon
is
bright
let
the
breeze
of
twilight
blow
through
the
silent
hall
and
the
dreaming
rafters
hear
how
the
thrushes
call
oh
be
merciful
and
fond
to
the
house
that
gave
all
its
best
to
shelter
love
built
when
love
was
brave
here
we
came
when
love
was
young
now
that
love
is
old
never
let
its
day
be
lone
nor
its
heart
acold
the
starry
midnight
whispers
the
starry
midnight
whispers
as
i
muse
before
the
fire
on
the
ashes
of
ambition
and
the
embers
of
desire
life
has
no
other
logic
and
time
no
other
creed
than
for
joy
will
follow
where
thou
for
love
dost
lead
a
lyric
oh
once
i
could
not
understand
the
sob
within
the
throat
of
spring
the
shrilling
of
the
frogs
nor
why
the
birds
so
passionately
sing
that
was
before
your
beauty
came
and
stooped
to
teach
my
soul
desire
when
on
these
mortal
lips
you
laid
the
magic
and
immortal
fire
i
wondered
why
the
sea
should
seem
so
gray
so
lonely
and
so
old
the
sigh
of
snows
in
winter
so
forlornly
cold
i
wondered
what
it
was
could
give
the
scarlet
autumn
pomps
their
pride
and
paint
with
colors
not
of
earth
the
glory
of
the
mountainside
i
could
not
tell
why
youth
should
dream
and
worship
at
the
evening
star
and
yet
must
go
with
eager
feet
where
danger
and
where
splendor
are
i
could
not
guess
why
men
at
times
beholding
beauty
should
go
mad
with
joy
or
sorrow
or
despair
or
some
unknown
delight
they
had
i
wondered
what
they
had
received
from
time
inexorable
hand
so
full
of
loveliness
and
doom
but
now
ah
now
i
understand
april
now
in
morning
clad
april
now
in
morning
clad
like
a
gleaming
oread
with
the
south
wind
in
her
voice
comes
to
bid
the
world
rejoice
with
the
sunlight
on
her
brow
through
her
veil
of
silver
showers
april
new
england
now
trails
her
robe
of
woodland
flowers
violet
and
anemone
while
along
the
misty
sea
pipe
at
lip
she
seems
to
blow
haunting
airs
of
long
ago
nike
what
do
men
give
thanks
for
i
give
thanks
for
one
lovelier
than
morning
dearer
than
the
sun
such
a
head
the
victors
must
have
praised
and
known
with
that
breast
and
bearing
nike
very
own
as
superb
untrammeled
rhythmed
and
poised
and
free
as
the
strong
pure
walking
on
the
sea
such
a
hand
as
beauty
uses
with
full
heart
seeking
for
her
freedom
in
new
shapes
of
art
soft
as
rain
in
april
quiet
as
the
days
of
the
purple
asters
and
the
autumn
haze
with
a
soul
more
subtle
than
the
light
of
stars
frailer
than
a
moth
wing
to
the
touch
that
mars
wise
with
all
the
silence
of
the
waiting
hills
when
the
gracious
twilight
wakes
in
them
and
thrills
with
a
voice
more
tender
than
the
early
moon
hears
among
the
thrushes
in
the
woods
of
june
delicate
as
grasses
when
they
lift
and
stir
one
sweet
lyric
woman
i
give
thanks
for
her
the
enchanted
traveller
we
travelled
with
hearts
all
fear
above
for
we
ate
the
bread
of
friendship
we
drank
the
wine
of
love
through
many
a
wondrous
autumn
through
many
a
magic
spring
we
hailed
the
scarlet
banners
we
heard
the
sing
we
looked
on
life
and
nature
with
the
eager
eyes
of
youth
and
all
we
asked
or
cared
for
was
beauty
joy
and
truth
we
found
no
other
wisdom
we
learned
no
other
way
than
the
gladness
of
the
morning
the
glory
of
the
day
so
all
our
earthly
treasure
shall
go
with
us
my
dears
aboard
the
shadow
liner
across
the
sea
of
years
spring
saraband
over
the
hills
of
april
with
soft
winds
hand
in
hand
impassionate
and
spring
leads
her
saraband
her
garments
float
and
gather

swirl
along

her
headgear
is
the
golden
sun
her
cloak
the
silver
rain
with
color
and
with
music
with
perfumes
and
with
pomp
by
meadowland
and
upland
through
pasture
wood
and
swamp
with
promise
and
enchantment
leading
her
mystic
mime
she
comes
to
lure
the
world
anew
with
joy
as
old
as
time
quick
lifts
the
marshy
chorus
to
transport
trill
on
trill
there
not
a
rod
of
stony
ground
unanswering
on
the
hill
the
brooks
and
little
rivers
dance
down
their
wild
ravines
and
children
in
the
city
squares
keep
time
to
tambourines
the
bluebird
in
the
orchard
is
lyrical
for
her
the
blackbird
with
his
meadow
pipe
sets
all
the
wood
astir
the

white
are
curtsying
in

the

hepaticas
are
out
under
the
chestnut
trees
the
maple
buds
make
glamor
viburnum
waves
its
bloom
the
daffodils
and
tulips
are
risen
from
the
tomb
the
lances
of
narcissus
have
pierced
the
wintry
mold
the
commonplace
seems
paradise
through
veils
of
greening
gold
o
heart
hear
thou
the
summons
put
every
grief
away
when
all
the
motley
masques
of
earth
are
glad
upon
a
day
alack
that
any
mortal
should
less
than
gladness
bring
into
the
choral
joy
that
sounds
the
saraband
of
spring
triumphalis
soul
art
thou
sad
again
with
the
old
sadness
thou
shalt
be
glad
again
with
a
new
gladness
when
april
sun
and
rain
mount
to
the
teeming
brain
with
the
earth
madness
when
from
the
mould
again
spurning
disaster
spring
shoots
unfold
again
follow
thou
faster
out
of
the
drear
domain
of
dark
defeat
and
pain
praising
the
master
hope
for
thy
guide
again
ample
and
splendid
love
at

all
doubting
ended
ah
by
the
dragon
slain
for
nothing

thou
shalt
take
heart
again
no

how
the

refrain
runs
through

thou

the
lengthening
twilights
hold
tints
of
lavender
and
gold
and
the
marshy
places
ring
with
the
pipers
of
the
spring
now
the
solitary
star
lays
a
path
on
meadow
streams
and
i
know
it
is
not
far
to
the
open
door
of
dreams
lord
of
april
in
my
hour
may
the
dogwood
be
in
flower
and
my
angel
through
the
dome
of
spring
twilight
lead
me
home
the
soul
of
april
over
the
wintry
threshold
who
comes
with
joy
so
frail
yet
so
enduring
to
triumph
dismay
ah
quick
her
tears
are
springing
and
quickly
they
are
dried
for
sorrow
walks
before
her
but
gladness
walks
beside
she
comes
with
gusts
of
laughter
the
music
as
of
rills
with
tenderness
and
sweetness
the
wisdom
of
the
hills
her
hands
are
strong
to
comfort
her
heart
is
quick
to
heed
she
knows
the
signs
of
sadness
she
knows
the
voice
of
need
there
is
no
living
creature
however
poor
or
small
but
she
will
know
its
trouble
and
hasten
to
its
call
oh
well
they
fare
forever
by
mighty
dreams
possessed
whose
hearts
have
lain
a
moment
on
that
eternal
breast
an
april
morning
once
more
in
misted
april
the
world
is
growing
green
along
the
winding
river
the
plumey
willows
lean
beyond
the
sweeping
meadows
the
looming
mountains
rise
like
battlements
of
dreamland
against
the
brooding
skies
in
every
wooded
valley
the
buds
are
breaking
through
as
though
the
heart
of
all
things
no
languor
ever
knew
the
and
bluebirds
call
to
their
heavenly
choirs
the
pines
are
blued
and
drifted
with
smoke
of
brushwood
fires
and
in
my
sister
garden
where
little
breezes
run
the
golden
daffodillies
are
blowing
in
the
sun
earth
voices
i
i
heard
the
spring
wind
whisper
above
the
brushwood
fire
the
world
is
made
forever
of
transport
and
desire
i
am
the
breath
of
being
the
primal
urge
of
things
i
am
the
whirl
of
star
dust
i
am
the
lift
of
wings
i
am
the
splendid
impulse
that
comes
before
the
thought
the
joy
and
exaltation
wherein
the
life
is
caught
across
the
sleeping
furrows
i
call
the
buried
seed
and
blade
and
bud
and
blossom
awaken
at
my
need
within
the
dying
ashes
i
blow
the
sacred
spark
and
make
the
hearts
of
lovers
to
leap
against
the
dark
ii
i
heard
the
spring
light
whisper
above
the
dancing
stream
the
world
is
made
forever
in
likeness
of
a
dream
i
am
the
law
of
planets
i
am
the
guide
of
man
the
evening
and
the
morning
are
fashioned
to
my
plan
i
tint
the
dawn
with
crimson
i
tinge
the
sea
with
blue
my
track
is
in
the
desert
my
trail
is
in
the
dew
i
paint
the
hills
with
color
and
in
my
magic
dome
i
light
the
star
of
evening
to
steer
the
traveller
home
within
the
house
of
being
i
feed
the
lamp
of
truth
with
tales
of
ancient
wisdom
and
prophecies
of
youth
iii
i
heard
the
spring
rain
murmur
above
the
roadside
flower
the
world
is
made
forever
in
melody
and
power
i
keep
the
rhythmic
measure
that
marks
the
steps
of
time
and
all
my
toil
is
fashioned
to
symmetry
and
rhyme
i
plow
the
untilled
upland
i
ripe
the
seeding
grass
and
fill
the
leafy
forest
with
music
as
i
pass
i
hew
the
raw
rough
granite
to
loveliness
of
line
and
when
my
work
is
finished
behold
it
is
divine
i
am
the
in
whom
the
ages
trust
i
lift
the
lost
perfection
to
blossom
from
the
dust
iv
then
earth
to
them
made
answer
as
with
a
slow
refrain
born
of
the
blended
voices
of
wind
and
sun
and
rain
this
is
the
law
of
being
that
links
the
threefold
chain
the
life
we
give
to
beauty
returns
to
us
again
resurgam
lo
now
comes
the
april
pageant
and
the
easter
of
the
year
now
the
tulip
lifts
her
chalice
and
the
hyacinth
his
spear
all
the
daffodils
and
jonquils
with
their
hearts
of
gold
are
here
child
of
the
immortal
vision
what
hast
thou
to
do
with
fear
when
the
summons
wakes
the
impulse
and
the
blood
beats
in
the
vein
let
no
grief
thy
dream
encumber
no
regret
thy
thought
detain
through
the
scented
valleys
over
tillage
wood
and
plain
comes
the
soothing
south
wind
laden
with
the
sweet
impartial
rain
all
along
the
roofs
and
pavements
pass
the
volleying
silver
showers
to
unfold
the
hearts
of
humans
and
the
frail
unanxious
flowers
breeding
fast
in
sunlit
places
teeming
life
puts
forth
her
powers
and
the
migrant
wings
come
northward
on
the
trail
of
golden
hours
over
intervale
and
upland
sounds
the
robin
interlude
from
his
spire
at
evening
where
no
unbeliefs
intrude
every
follower
of
beauty
finds
in
the
spring
solitude
sanctuary
and
persuasion
where
the
mysteries
still
brood
now
the
bluebird
in
the
orchard
a
warm
sighing
at
the
door
and
the
soft
haze
on
the
hillside
lure
the
houseling
to
explore
the
perennial
enchanted
lovely
world
and
all
its
lore
while
the
early
tender
twilight
breathes
of
those
who
come
no
more
by
full
brimming
river
margins
where
the
scents
of
brush
fires
blow
through
the
faint
green
mist
of
springtime
dreaming
lovers
go
touched
with
such
immortal
madness
not
a
thing
they
care
to
know
more
than
those
who
caught
life
secret
countless
centuries
ago
in
old
egypt
for
osiris
putting
on
the
green
attire
with
soft
hymns
and
choric
dancing
they
went
forth
to
greet
the
fire
of
the
vernal
sun
whose
ardor
his
earth
children
could
inspire
and
the
ivory
flutes
would
lead
them
to
the
slake
of
their
desire
in
remembrance
of
adonis
did
the
dorian
maidens
sing
linus
songs
of
joy
and
sorrow
for
the
coming
back
of
spring
sorrow
for
the
wintry
death
of
each
irrevocable
thing
joy
for
all
the
pangs
of
beauty
the
returning
year
could
bring
now
the
priests
and
holy
women
with
sweet
incense
chant
and
prayer
keep
his
death
and
resurrection
whose
new
love
bade
all
men
share
immortality
of
kindness
living
to
make
life
more
fair
wakened
to
such
wealth
of
being
who
would
not
arise
and
dare
seeing
how
each
new
fulfilment
issues
at
the
call
of
need
from
infinitudes
of
purpose
in
the
core
of
soul
and
seed
who
shall
set
the
bounds
of
puissance
or
the
formulas
of
creed
truth
awaits
the
test
of
beauty
good
is
proven
in
the
deed
therefore
give
thy
spring
renascence
freshened
ardor
dreams
and
mirth
to
make
perfect
and
replenish
all
the
sorry
fault
and
dearth
of
the
life
from
whose
enrichment
thine
aspiring
will
had
birth
take
thy
part
in
the
redemption
of
thy
kind
from
bonds
of
earth
so
shalt
thou
absorbed
in
beauty
even
in
this
mortal
clime
share
the
life
that
is
eternal
brother
to
the
lords
of
time
virgil
raphael
gautama
builders
of
the
world
sublime
yesterday
was
not
earth
evening
every
morning
is
our
prime
all
that
can
be
worth
the
rescue
from
oblivion
and
decay
joy
and
loveliness
and
wisdom
in
thyself
without
dismay
thou
shalt
save
and
make
enduring
through
each
word
and
act
to
sway
the
hereafter
to
a
likeness
of
thyself
in
other
clay
still
remains
the
peradventure
soul
pursues
an
orbit
here
like
those
unreturning
comets
sweeping
on
a
vast
career
by
an
infinite
directrix
focussed
to
a
finite
sphere
nurtured
in
an
earthly
april
in
what
realm
to
reappear
easter
eve
if
i
should
tell
you
i
saw
pan
lately
down
by
the
shallows
of
silvermine
blowing
an
air
on
his
pipe
of
willow
just
as
the
moon
began
to
shine
or
say
that
coming
from
town
on
wednesday
i
met
christ
walking
in
ponus
street
you
might
remark
our
friend
is
flighty
visions
for
want
of
enough
red
meat
then
let
me
ask
you
last
december
when
there
was
skating
on
wampanaw
among
the
weeds
and
sticks
and
grasses
under
the
hard
black
ice
i
saw
an
old
poking
about
as
if
he
were
putting
his
house
to
rights
stiff
with
the
cold
perhaps
yet
knowing
enough
to
prepare
for
the
winter
nights
and
here
he
is
on
a
log
this
morning
sunning
himself
as
calm
as
you
please
but
i
want
to
know
when
the
lock
of
winter
was
sprung
of
a
sudden
who
kept
the
keys
who
told
old
nibbler
to
go
to
sleep
safe
and
sound
with
the
lily
roots
and
then
in
the
first
warm
days
of
april
out
to
the
sun
with
the
greening
shoots
by
night
a
flock
of
geese
went
over
honking
north
on
the
trails
of
air
the
spring
express
but
who
despatched
it
equipped
with
speed
and
cunning
care
hark
to
our
bluebird
down
in
the
orchard
trolling
his
chant
of
the
happy
heart
as
full
of
light
as
a
theme
of
mozart
but
where
did
he
learn
that
more
than
art
where
the
river
winds
through
grassy
meadows
as
sure
as
the
south
wind
brings
the
rain
sounding
his
reedy
note
in
the
alders
the
redwing
comes
back
to
his
nest
again
are
these
not
miracles
prompt
you
answer
merely
the
prose
of
natural
fact
nothing
but
instinct
plain
and
patent
born
in
the
creatures
that
bids
them
act
well
i
have
an
instinct
as
fine
and
valid
surely
as
that
of
the
beasts
and
birds
concerning
death
and
the
life
immortal
too
deep
for
logic
too
vague
for
words
no
trace
of
beauty
can
pass
or
perish
but
other
beauty
is
somewhere
born
no
seed
of
truth
or
good
be
planted
but
the
yield
must
grow
as
the
growing
corn
therefore
this
ardent
mind
and
spirit
i
give
to
the
glowing
days
of
earth
to
be
wrought
by
the
lord
of
life
to
something
of
lasting
import
and
lovely
worth
if
the
toil
i
give
be
without
bestowed
to
the
limit
of
will
and
power
to
fashion
after
some
form
ideal
the
instant
task
and
the
waiting
hour
it
matters
not
though
defeat
undo
me
though
faults
betray
me
and
sorrows
scar
already
i
share
the
life
eternal
with
the
april
buds
and
the
evening
star
the
slim
new
moon
is
my
sister
now
the
rain
my
brother
the
wind
my
friend
is
it
not
well
with
these
forever
can
the
soul
of
man
fare
ill
in
the
end
now
is
the
time
of
year
now
is
the
time
of
year
when
all
the
flutes
begin
the
redwing
bold
and
clear
the
rainbird
far
and
thin
in
all
the
waking
lands
there
not
a
wilding
thing
but
knows
and
understands
the
burden
of
the
spring
now
every
voice
alive
by
rocky
wood
and
stream
is
lifted
to
revive
the
ecstasy
the
dream
for
nature
never
old
but
busy
as
of
yore
from
sun
and
rain
and
mould
is
making
spring
once
more
she
sounds
her
magic
note
by
and
hill
and
every
woodland
throat
with
a
thrill
o
mother
of
our
days
hearing
thy
music
call
teach
us
to
know
thy
ways
and
fear
no
more
at
all
the
redwing
i
hear
you
brother
i
hear
you
down
in
the
alder
swamp
springing
your
woodland
whistle
to
herald
the
april
pomp
first
of
the
moving
vanguard
in
front
of
the
spring
you
come
where
flooded
waters
sparkle
and
streams
in
the
twilight
hum
you
sound
the
note
of
the
chorus
by
meadow
and
woodland
pond
till
one
after
one
a
myriad
throats
respond
i
see
you
brother
i
see
you
with
scarlet
under
your
wing
flash
through
the
ruddy
maples
leading
the
pageant
of
spring
earth
has
put
off
her
raiment
wintry
and
worn
and
old
for
the
robe
of
a
fair
young
sibyl
dancing
in
green
and
gold
i
heed
you
brother
i
too
in
the
great
employ
will
shed
my
old
coat
of
sorrow
for
a
garment
of
joy
the
rainbird
i
hear
a
rainbird
singing
far
off
how
fine
and
clear
his
plaintive
voice
comes
ringing
with
rapture
to
the
ear
over
the
misty
across
the
first
spring
heat
comes
the
enchanted
cadence
so
clear
so
how
often
i
have
hearkened
to
that
high
pealing
strain
across
wild
cedar
barrens
under
the
soft
gray
rain
how
often
i
have
wondered
and
longed
in
vain
to
know
the
source
of
that
enchantment
that
touch
of
human
woe
o
brother
who
first
taught
thee
to
haunt
the
teeming
spring
with
that
sad
mortal
wisdom
which
only
age
can
bring
lament
when
you
hear
the
pealing
from
a
far
away
and
the
hills
are
touched
with
purple
at
the
borders
of
the
day
when
the
redwing
sounds
his
whistle
at
the
coming
on
of
spring
and
the
joyous
april
pipers
make
the
alder
marshes
ring
when
the
wild
new
breath
of
being
whispers
to
the
world
once
more
and
before
the
shrine
of
beauty
every
spirit
must
adore
when
long
thoughts
come
back
with
twilight
and
a
tender
deepened
mood
shows
the
eyes
of
the
beloved
like
the
hepaticas
in
the
wood
ah
remember
when
to
nothing
save
to
love
your
heart
gives
heed
and
spring
takes
you
to
her
bosom
so
it
was
with
golden
weed
under
the
april
moon
oh
well
the
world
is
dreaming
under
the
april
moon
her
soul
in
love
with
beauty
her
senses
all
pure
hangs
the
silver
crescent
above
the
twilight
wood
and
pure
the
silver
music
wakes
from
the
marshy
flood
o
earth
with
all
thy
transport
how
comes
it
life
should
seem
a
shadow
in
the
moonlight
a
murmur
in
a
dream
the
flute
of
spring
i
know
a
shining
meadow
stream
that
winds
beneath
an
eastern
hill
and
all
year
long
in
sun
or
gloom
its
murmuring
voice
is
never
still
the
summer
dies
more
gently
there
the
april
flowers
are
earlier
the
first
warm
from
the
sound
sets
all
their
eager
hearts
astir
and
there
when
lengthening
twilights
fall
as
softly
as
a
wild
bird
wing
across
the
valley
in
the
dusk
i
hear
the
silver
flute
of
spring
spring
night
in
the
wondrous
night
in
the
first
sweet
warmth
of
spring
i
lie
awake
and
listen
to
hear
the
glad
earth
sing
i
hear
the
brook
in
the
wood
murmuring
as
it
goes
the
song
of
the
happy
journey
only
the
wise
heart
knows
i
hear
the
trilling
note
of
the
under
the
hill
and
the
clear
and
watery
treble
of
his
brother
silvery
shrill
and
then
i
wander
away
through
the
mighty
forest
of
sleep
to
follow
the
fairy
music
to
the
shore
of
an
endless
deep
bloodroot
when
april
winds
arrive
and
the
soft
rains
are
here
some
morning
by
the
roadside
these
fairy
folk
appear
we
never
see
their
coming
however
sharp
our
eyes
each
year
as
if
by
magic
they
take
us
by
surprise
along
the
ragged
woodside
and
by
the
green
their
small
white
heads
are
nodding
and
twinkling
in
the
sun
they
crowd
across
the
meadow
in
innocence
and
mirth
as
if
there
were
no
sorrow
in
all
this
wondrous
earth
so
frail
so
unregarded
and
yet
about
them
clings
a
sorcery
of
welcome
the
joy
of
common
things
perhaps
their
trail
of
beauty
across
the
pasture
sod
in
jubilant
procession
is
where
an
angel
trod
daffodil
return
what
matter
if
the
sun
be
lost
what
matter
though
the
sky
be
gray
there
joy
enough
about
the
house
for
daffodil
comes
home
there
news
of
swallows
on
the
air
there
word
of
april
on
the
way
they
calling
flowers
within
the
street
and
daffodil
comes
home
o
who
would
care
what
fate
may
bring
or
what
the
years
may
take
away
there
life
enough
within
the
hour
for
daffodil
comes
home
now
the
lilac
tree
in
bud
now
the
lilac
tree
in
bud
and
the
morning
birds
are
loud
now
a
stirring
in
the
blood
moves
the
heart
of
every
crowd
word
has
gone
abroad
somewhere
of
a
great
impending
change
there
a
message
in
the
air
of
an
import
glad
and
strange
not
an
idler
in
the
street
but
is
better
off
not
a
traveller
you
meet
but
has
something
wise
to
say
now
there
not
a
road
too
long
not
a
day
that
is
not
good
not
a
mile
but
hears
a
song
lifted
from
the
misty
wood
down
along
the
silvermine
that
the
blackbird
cheerful
note
you
can
see
him
flash
and
shine
with
the
scarlet
on
his
coat
now
the
winds
are
soft
with
rain
and
the
twilight
has
a
spell

from
gladness

sorrows
dwell
white

white
iris
was
a
princess
in
a
kingdom
long
ago
mysterious
as
moonlight
and
silent
as
the
snow
she
drew
the
world
in
wonder
and
swayed
it
with
desire
ere
babylon
was
builded
or
a
stone
laid
in

yet
here
within
my
garden
her
loveliness
appears
undimmed
by
any
sorrow
of
all
the
tragic
years
how
kind
that
earth
should
treasure
so
beautiful

thing
all
mystical

stir
our
hearts

because
he
grew

fast
we
scorned
his

doubted
it

lo
when
autumn
gathers
and
all
the
woods
are
old
he
stands
in
green

here
comes
the
man
and
through

caught
the
piping
of
the
urban
pan
i
laid
my
wintry
task
aside
and
took
a
day
to
follow
joy
the
trail
of
beauty
and
the
call
that
lured
me
when
i
was
a
boy
i
looked
and
there
looked
up
at
me
a
smiling
swarthy
hairy
man
with
kindling
eye
and
well
i
knew
the
piping
of
the
urban
pan
he
caught
my
mood
his
hat
was
off
i
tossed
the
ungrudged
silver
down
the
cunning
vagrant
every
year
he
casts
his
spell
upon
the
town
and
we
must
fling
him
old
and
young
our
dimes
or
coppers
as
we
can
and
every
heart
must
leap
to
hear
the
piping
of
the
urban
pan
the
music
swells
and
fades
again
and
i
in
dreams
am
far
away
where
a
bright
river
sparkles
down
to
meet
a
blue
aegean
bay
there
in
the
springtime
of
the
world
are
dancing
fauns
and
in
their
van
is
one
who
pipes
a
deathless
tune
the
and
the
urban
pan
and
so
he
follows
down
the
block
a
troop
of
children
in
his
train
the
dancers
of
the
street
enamored
of
the
reedy
strain
i
hear
their
laughter
rise
and
ring
above
the
noise
of
truck
and
van
as
down
the
mellow
wind
fades
out
the
piping

drooped
the

hung
sagging
over
the

idle
the

the

one
mirror
of

a
single
breath
would
destroy
save
for
the
far

eastward
there
toward

what
castled
cities
rise
from
the
atlantic
plain
to
our
enchanted
eyes
turret
and
spire
and
roof
looming
out
of
the

where
the
prosy
chart
gives

no

be
can
a
vision
shine
so
clear
wherein
no
substance
dwells
one
almost
harks
to
hear
the
sound
of
the
city
bells
and
yet
no
pealing
notes
within
those
belfries
be
save
echoes
from
the
throats
of
lost
at
sea
for
none
shall
anchor
there
save
those
who
long
of
yore
when
tide
and
wind
were
fair
sailed
and
came
back
no
more
and
none
shall
climb
the
stairs
within
those
ghostly
towers
save
those
for
whom
sad
prayers
went
up
through
fateful
hours
o
image
of
the
world
o
mirage
of
the
sea
and
what
sorcery
fashioned
thee
what
architect
of
dream
what
painter
of
desire
conceived
that
fairy
scheme
touched
with
fantastic
fire
even
so
our
city
of
hope
we
mortal
dreamers
rear
upon
the
perilous
slope
above
the
deep
of
fear
leaving
the
good
our
kindly
earth
bestows
for
the
feigned
beatitude
of
a
future
no
man
knows
lord
of
the
summer
sea
whose
tides
are
in
thy
hand
into
immensity
the
vision
at
thy
command
fades
now
and
leaves
no
sign
no
light
nor
bell
nor
buoy
only
the
faint
low
line
of
dangerous
monomoy
in
germain
street
through
the
street
of
germain
march
the
tattered
hosts
of
rain
while
the
wind
with
vagrant
fife
whips
their
chilly
ranks
to
life
from
the
window
i
can
see
their
ghostly
banners
blowing
free
as
they
pass
to
where
the
ships
crowd
about
the
wharves
and
slips
there
at
day
end
they
embark
to
invade
the
realms
of
dark
and
the
sun
comes
out
again
in
the
street
of
germain
pan
in
the
catskills
they
say
that
he
is
dead
and
now
no
more
the
reedy
syrinx
sounds
among
the
hills
when
the
long
summer
heat
is
on
the
land
but
i
have
heard
the
catskill
thrushes
sing
and
therefore
am
incredulous
of
death
of
pain
and
sorrow
and
mortality
in
these
blue
cañons
deep
with
hemlock
shade
in
solitudes
of
twilight
or
of
dawn
i
have
been
rapt
away
from
time
and
care
by
the
enchantment
of
a
golden
strain
as
pure
as
ever
pierced
the
thracian
wild
filling
the
listener
with
a
mute
surmise
at
evening
and
at
morning
i
have
gone
down
the
cool
trail
between
the
boles
and
heard
the
haunting
music
of
the
wood
ring
through
the
silence
of
the
dark
ravine
flooding
the
earth
with
beauty
and
with
joy
and
all
the
ardors
of
creation
old
and
then
within
my
pagan
heart
awoke
remembrance
of
and
fabled
years
in
the
untarnished
sunrise
of
the
world
when
hellas
in
her
rapture
heard
a
slow
mysterious
piping
wild
and
keen
thrill
through
her
vales
and
whispered
it
is
pan
a
new
england
june
things
i
remember
of
new
england
june
like
a
vivid
in
the
azure
noon
while
one
haunting
figure
strays
through
every
scene
like
the
soul
of
beauty
through
her
lost
gardens
full
of
roses
and
peonies
in
the
dewy
morning
row
on
stately
row
spreading
their
gay
patterns
crimson
pied
and
cream
like
some
gorgeous
fresco
or
an
eastern
dream
nets
of
waving
sunlight
falling
through
the
trees
fields
of
daisies
rippling
in
the
breeze
lazy
lifting
groundswells
breaking
green
as
jade
on
the
lilac
beaches
where
the
wade
orchards
full
of
blossom
where
the
calls
and
the
honeysuckle
climbs
the
old
gray
walls
groves
of
silver
birches
beds
of
roadside
fern
in
the
pasture
at
the
river
turn
of
every
picture
still
she
comes
to
me
with
the
morning
freshness
of
the
summer
sea
a
glory
in
her
bearing
a
in
her
eyes
as
if
she
could
not
forget
the
spell
of
thrushes
in
the
deep
woods
with
their
golden
themes
fluting
like
the
choirs
at
the
birth
of
dreams
fireflies
in
the
meadows
at
the
gate
of
night
with
their
fairy
lanterns
twinkling
soft
and
bright
ah
not
in
the
roses
nor
the
azure
noon
nor
the
thrushes
music
lies
the
soul
of
june
it
is
something
finer
more
unfading
far
than
the
primrose
evening
and
the
silver
star
something
of
the
rapture
my
beloved
had
when
she
made
the
morning
radiant
and
glad
something
of
her
gracious
ecstasy
of
mien
that
still
haunts
the
twilight
loving
though
unseen
the
ghostly
moonlight
walks
my
garden
ground
like
a
leisurely
patrol
on
his
nightly
round
these
things
i
remember
of
the
long
ago
while
the
slumbrous
roses
neither
care
nor
the
tent
of
noon
behold
now
where
the
pageant
of
high
june
halts
in
the
glowing
noon
the
trailing
shadows
rest
on
plain
and
hill
the
bannered
hosts
are
still
while
over
forest
crown
and
mountain
head
the
azure
tent
is
spread
the
song
is
hushed
in
every
woodland
throat
moveless
the
lilies
float
even
the
ancient
sea
sighs
only
fitfully
the
cattle
drowse
in
the
shade
peace
on
the
world
is
laid
it
is
the
hour
when
nature
caravan
that
bears
the
pilgrim
man
across
the
desert
of

rests
in

as
if
the
end
drew
near
ah
traveller
hast
thou
naught
of
thanks
or
praise
for
these
fleet
halcyon
days
no
courage
to
uplift
thee
from
despair
born
with
the
breath
of
prayer
then
turn
thee
to
the
lilied
field
once
more
god
stands
in
his
tent
door
children
of

the

grows
in
the
swampy

the

for

are
creatures

and
children

roadside
flowers
we
are
the
roadside
flowers
straying
from
garden
grounds
lovers
of
idle
hours
breakers
of
ordered
bounds
if
only
the
earth
will
feed
us
if
only
the

be
kind
we
blossom
for
those
who
need
us
the
stragglers
left
behind
and
lo
the
lord
of
the
garden
he
makes
his
sun
to
rise
and
his
rain
to
fall
with
pardon
on
our
dusty
paradise
on
us
he
has
laid
the
duty
the
task
of
the
wandering
breed
to
better
the
world
with
beauty
wherever
the
way
may
lead
who
shall
inquire
of
the
season
or
question
the
wind
where
it
blows
we
blossom
and
ask
no
reason
the
lord
of
the
garden
knows
the
garden
of
saint
rose
this
is
a
holy
refuge
the
garden
of
saint
rose
a
fragrant
altar
to
that
peace
the
world
no
longer
knows
below
a
solemn
hillside
within
the
folding
shade
of
overhanging
beech
and
pine
its
walls
and
walks
are
laid
cool
through
the
heat
of
summer
still
as
a
sacred
grove
it
has
the
rapt
unworldly
air
of
mystery
and
love
all
day
before
its
outlook
the
mountains
loom
and
in
its
trees
at
tranquil
dusk
the
early
stars
will
bloom
down
its
enchanted
borders
glad
ranks
of
color
stand
like
hosts
of
silent
seraphim
awaiting
love
command
lovely
in
adoration
they
wait
in
patient
line
and
purple
and
deep
gold
about
the
shrine
and
there
they
guard
the
silence
while
still
from
her
recess
through
sun
and
shade
saint
rose
looks
down
in
mellow
loveliness
she
seems
to
say
o
stranger
behold
how
loving
care
that
gives
its
life
for
beauty
sake
makes
everything
more
fair
then
praise
the
lord
of
gardens
for
tree
and
flower
and
vine
and
bless
all
gardeners
who
have
wrought
a
resting
place
like
mine
the
world
voice
i
heard
the
summer
sea
murmuring
to
the
shore
some
endless
story
of
a
wrong
the
whole
world
must
deplore
i
heard
the
mountain
wind
conversing
with
the
trees
of
an
old
sorrow
of
the
hills
mysterious
as
the
sea
and
all
that
haunted
day
it
seemed
that
i
could
hear
the
echo
of
an
ancient
speech
ring
in
my
listening
ear
and
then
it
came
to
me
that
all
that
i
had
heard
was
my
own
heart
in
the
sea
voice
and
the
wind
lonely
word
songs
of
the
grass
i
on
the
dunes
here
all
night
on
the
dunes
in
the
rocking
wind
we
sleep
watched
by
sentry
stars
lulled
by
the
drone
of
the
deep
till
hark
in
the
chill
of
the
dawn
a
field
lark
wakes
and
cries
and
over
the
floor
of
the
sea
we
watch
the
round
sun
rise
the
world
is
washed
once
more
in
a
tide
of
purple
and
gold
and
the
heart
of
the
land
is
filled
with
desires
and
dreams
untold
ii
lord
of
morning
lord
of
morning
light
of
day
sacred
sun
we
salute
thee
in
the
way
pilgrims
robed
in
rose
and
dun
for
thou
art
a
pilgrim
too
overlord
of
all
our
band
in
thy
fervor
we
renew
quests
we
do
not
understand
at
thy
summons
we
arise
at
thy
touch
put
glory
on
and
with
glad
unanxious
eyes
take
the
journey
thou
hast
gone
iii
the
traveller
before
the
fades
and
the
stars
are
quite
gone
i
lift
my
head
at
the
noiseless
tread
of
the
angel
of
dawn
i
hear
no
word
yet
my
heart
is
beating
apace
then
in
glory
all
still
on
the
eastern
hill
i
behold
his
face
all
day
through
the
world
he
goes
making
glad
setting
free
then
his
day
work
done
on
the
galleon
sun
he
sinks
in
the
sea
the
choristers
when
earth
was
finished
and
fashioned
well
there
was
never
a
musical
note
to
tell
how
glad
god
was
save
the
voice
of
the
rain
and
the
sea
and
the
wind
on
the
lonely
plain
and
the
rivers
among
the
hills
and
so
god
made
the
marvellous
birds
for
a
choir
of
joy
transcending
words
that
the
world
might
hear
and
comprehend
how
rhythm
and
harmony
can
mend
the
spirits
hurts
and
ills
he
filled
their
tiny
bodies
with
fire
he
taught
them
love
for
their
chief
desire
and
gave
them
the
magic
of
wings
to
be
his
celebrants
over
land
and
sea
wherever
man
might
dwell
and
to
each
he
apportioned
a
fragment
of
song
those
broken
melodies
that
belong
to
the
seraphs
chorus
that
we
might
learn
the
healing
of
gladness
and
discern
in
beauty
how
all
is
well
so
music
dwells
in
the
glorious
throats
forever
and
the
enchanted
notes
fall
with
rapture
upon
our
ears
moving
our
hearts
to
joy
and
tears
for
things
we
can
not
say
in
the
wilds
the
whitethroat
sings
in
the
rain
his
pure
serene
strain
and
when
twilight
falls
the
sleeping
hills
ring
with
the
cry
of
the
whippoorwills
in
the
blue
dusk
far
away
in
the
great
white
heart
of
the
winter
storm
the
chickadee
sings
for
his
heart
is
warm
and
his
note
is
brave
to
rally
the
soul
from
doubt
and
panic
to
and
elation
that
knows
no
fear
the
bluebird
comes
with
the
winds
of
march
like
a
shred
of
sky
on
the
naked
larch
the
redwing
follows
the
april
rain
to
whistle
contentment
back
again
with
his
sturdy
call
of
cheer
the
orioles
revel
through
orchard
boughs
in
their
coats
of
gold
for
spring
carouse
in
shadowy
pastures
the
bobwhites
call
and
the
flute
of
the
thrush
has
a
melting
fall
under
the
evening
star
on
the
verge
of
june
when
peonies
blow
and
joy
comes
back
to
the
world
we
know
the
bobolinks
fill
the
fields
of
light
with
a
tangle
of
music
to
tell
how
glad
they
are
the
tiny
warblers
fill
summer
trees
with
their
exquisite
lesser
litanies
the
tanager
in
his
scarlet
coat
in
the
hemlock
pours
from
a
vibrant
throat
his
canticle
of
the
sun
the
loon
on
the
lake
the
hawk
in
the
sky
and
the
each
has
a
piercing
cry
like
outposts
set
in
the
lonely
vast
to
cry
all
well
as
time
goes
past
and
another
hour
is
gone
but
of
all
the
music
in
god
plan
of
a
mystical
symphony
for
man
i
shall
remember
best
of
all
whatever
hereafter
may
befall
or
pass
and
cease
to
be
the
hermit
hymn
in
the
solitudes
of
twilight
through
the
mountain
woods
and
the
crying
about
our
doors
on
the
soft
sweet
wind
across
the
moors
at
morning
by
the
sea
the
weed
counsel
a
traveller
by
the
way
pausing
what
hast
thou
to
say
flower
by
the
dusty
road
that
would
ease
a
mortal
load
traveller
hearken
unto
me
i
will
tell
thee
how
to
see
beauties
in
the
earth
and
sky
hidden
from
the
careless
eye
i
will
tell
thee
how
to
hear
nature
music
wild
and
clear
songs
of
midday
and
of
dark
such
as
many
never
mark
lyrics
of
creation
sung
ever
since
the
world
was
young
and
thereafter
thou
shalt
know
neither
weariness
nor
woe
thou
shalt
see
the
dawn
unfold
artistries
of
rose
and
gold
and
the
sunbeams
on
the
sea
dancing
with
the
wind
for
glee
the
red
lilies
of
the
moors
shall
be
torches
on
the
floors
where
the
lifts
his
cry
to
rejoice
the
in
a
wide
world
rimmed
with
blue
lovely
as
when
time
was
new
and
thereafter
thou
shalt
fare
light
of
foot
and
free
from
care
i
will
teach
thee
how
to
find
lost
enchantments
of
the
mind
all
about
thee
never
guessed
by
indifferent
unrest
thy
distracted
thought
shall
learn
patience
from
the
roadside
fern
and
a
sweet
philosophy
from
the
flowering
locust
tree
while
thy
heart
shall
not
disdain
the
consolation
of
the
rain
not
an
acre
but
shall
give
of
its
strength
to
help
thee
live
with
the
sun
shall
thy
hardy
course
be
run
and
the
bright
new
moon
shall
be
a
lamp
to
thy
felicity
when
spring
shall
come
past
thy
door
with
flute
and
drum
and
when
over
wood
and
swamp
autumn
trails
her
scarlet
pomp
no
misgiving
shalt
thou
know
passing
glad
to
rise
and
go
so
thy
days
shall
be
unrolled
like
a
wondrous
cloth
of
gold
when
gray
twilight
with
her
star
makes
a
heaven
that
is
not
far
touched
with
shadows
and
with
dreams
thou
shalt
hear
the
woodland
streams
singing
through
the
starry
night
holy
anthems
of
delight
so
the
ecstasy
of
earth
shall
refresh
thee
as
at
birth
and
thou
shalt
arise
each
morn
radiant
with
a
soul
reborn
and
this
wisdom
of
a
day
none
shall
ever
take
away
what
the
secret
what
the
clew
the
wayfarer
must
pursue
only
one
thing
he
must
have
who
would
share
these
transports
brave
love
within
his
heart
must
dwell
like
a
bubbling
roadside
well
for
a
spring
to
quicken
thought
else
my
counsel
comes
to
naught
for
without
that
quickening
trust
we
are
less
than
roadside
dust
this
o
traveller
is
my
creed
all
the
wisdom
of
the
weed
the
traveller
set
his
pack
once
more
on
his
dusty
back
and
trudged
on
for
many
a
mile
fronting
fortune
with
a
the
blue
heron
i
see
the
great
blue
heron
rising
among
the
reeds
and
floating
down
the
wind
like
a
gliding
sail
with
the
set
of
the
stream
i
hear
the
mower
clacking
among
the
hay
in
the
heat
of
a
july
noon
and
the
driver
voice
as
he
turns
his
team
i
see
the
meadow
lilies
flecked
with
their
darker
tan
the
elms
and
the
great
white
clouds
and
all
the
world
is
a
passing
dream
woodland
rain
shining
shining
children
of
the
summer
rain
racing
down
the
valley
sweeping
the
plain
rushing
through
the
forest
pelting
on
the
leaves
drenching
down
the
meadow
with
its
standing
sheaves
robed
in
royal
silver
girt
with
jewels
gay
with
a
gust
of
gladness
you
pass
upon
your
way
fresh
ah
fresh
behind
you
sunlit
and
impearled
as
it
was
in
eden
lies
the
lovely
world
summer
storm
the
hilltop
trees
are
bowing
under
the
coming
of
storm
the
low
gray
clouds
are
trailing
like
squadrons
that
sweep
and
form
with
their
ammunition
of
rain
then
the
trumpeter
wind
gives
signal
to
unlimber
the
viewless
guns
the
cattle
huddle
together
indoors
the
farmer
runs
and
the
first
shot
lashes
the
pane
they
charge
through
the
quiet
orchard
one
pear
tree
is
snapped
like
a
wand
as
they
sweep
from
the
shattered
hillside
ruffling
the
blackened
pond
ere
the
sun
takes
the
field
again
dance
of
the
sunbeams
when
morning
is
high
the
hilltops
on
river
and
stream
and
lake
wherever
a
young
breeze
whispers
the
dancers
wake
one
after
one
they
flash
from
their
dim
retreat
merry
as
running
laughter
is
the
news
of
their
twinkling
feet
over
the
floors
of
azure
wherever
the
run
sparkling
leaping
and
racing
their
antics
scatter
the
sun
as
long
as
water
ripples
and
weather
is
clear
and
glad
day
after
day
they
are
dancing
never
a
moment
sad
but
when
through
the
field
of
heaven
the
wings
of
storm
take
flight
at
a
touch
of
the
flying
shadows
they
falter
and
slip
from
sight
until
at
the
gray
day
ending
as
the
squadrons
of
cloud
retire
they
pass
in
the
triumph
of
sunset
with
banners
of
crimson
fire
the
campfire
of
the
sun
lo
now
the
journeying
sun
another
day
march
done
kindles
his
campfire
at
the
edge
of
night
and
in
the
twilight
pale
above
his
crimson
trail
the
stars
move
out
their
cordons
still
and
bright
now
in
the
darkening
hush
a
solitary
thrush
sings
on
in
silvery
rapture
to
the
deep
while
brooding
on
her
best
the
wandering
soul
has
rest
and
earth
receives
her
sacred
gift
of
sleep
summer
streams
all
day
long
beneath
the
sun
shining
through
the
fields
they
run
singing
in
a
cadence
known
to
the
seraphs
round
the
throne
and
the
traveller
drawing
near
through
the
meadow
halts
to
hear
anthems
of
a
natural
joy
no
disaster
can
destroy
all
night
long
from
set
of
sun
through
the
starry
woods
they
run
singing
through
the
purple
dark
songs
to
make
a
traveller
hark
all
night
long
when
winds
are
low
underneath
my
window
go
the
immortal
happy
streams
making
music
through
my
dreams
the
god
of
the
wood
here
all
the
forces
of
the
wood
as
one
converge
to
make
the
soul
of
solitude
where
all
things
merge
the
sun
the
and
the
rain
the
visiting
moon
the
hurrying
cloud
by
peak
and
plain
each
with
its
boon
here
power
attains
perfection
still
in
mighty
ease
that
the
great
earth
may
have
her
will
of
joy
and
peace
and
so
through
me
the
mortal
born
of
plasmic
clay
immortal
powers
kind
fierce
forlorn
and
glad
have
sway
eternal
passions
ardors
fine
and
monstrous
fears
rule
and
rebel
serene
malign
or
loosed
in
tears
until
at
last
they
shall
evolve
from
griefs
and
joys
some
steady
light
some
firm
resolve
some
godlike
poise
at
sunrise
now
the
stars
have
faded
in
the
purple
chill
lo
the
sun
is
kindling
on
the
eastern
hill
tree
by
tree
the
forest
takes
the
golden
tinge
as
the
shafts
of
glory
pierce
the
summit
fringe
rock
by
rock
the
ledges
take
the
rosy
sheen
as
the
tide
of
splendor
floods
the
dark
ravine
like
a
shining
angel
at
my
cabin
door
shod
with
hope
and
silence
day
is
come
once
more
then
as
if
in
sorrow
that
you
are
not
here
all
his
magic
beauties
gray
and
disappear
at
twilight
now
the
fire
is
lighted
on
the
chimney
stone
day
goes
down
the
valley
i
am
left
alone
now
the
misty
purple
floods
the
darkened
vale
and
the
stars
come
out
on
the
twilight
trail
the
mountain
river
murmurs
in
his
rocky
bed
and
the
stealthy
shadows
fill
the
house
with
dread
then
i
hear
your
laughter
at
the
open
door
brightly
burns
the
fire
i
need
fear
no
more
moonrise
at
the
end
of
the
road
through
the
wood
i
see
the
great
moon
rise
the
fields
are
flooded
with
shine
and
my
soul
with
surmise
what
if
that
mystic
orb
with
her
shadowy
beams
should
be
the
revealer
at
last
of
my
darkest
dreams
what
if
this
tender
fire
in
my
heart
deep
hold
should
be
wiser
than
all
the
lore
of
the
sages
of
old
the
queen
of
night
mortal
mortal
have
you
seen
in
the
scented
summer
night
great
astarte
clad
in
green
with
a
veil
of
mystic
light
passing
on
her
silent
way
pale
and
lovelier
than
day
mortal
mortal
have
you
heard
on
an
odorous
summer
eve
rumors
of
an
unknown
word
bidding
sorrow
not
to
grieve
echoes
of
a
silver
voice
bidding
every
heart
rejoice
mortal
when
the
slim
new
moon
hangs
above
the
western
hill
when
the
year
comes
round
to
june
and
the
leafy
world
is
still
then
enraptured
you
shall
hear
secrets
for
a
poet
ear
mortal
mortal
come
with
me
when
the
moon
is
rising
large
through
the
wood
or
from
the
sea
or
by
some
lone
river
marge
there
entranced
you
shall
behold
beauty
self
that
grows
not
old
night
lyric
in
the
world
far
edges
faint
and
blue
where
the
rocky
ledges
stand
in
view
fades
the
rosy
tender
evening
light
then
in
starry
splendor
comes
the
night
so
a
stormy
lifetime
comes
to
close
spirit
mortal
strifetime
finds
repose
faith
and
toil
and
vision
crowned
at
last
failure
and
derision
overpast
all
the
daylight
splendor
far
above
calm
and
sure
and
tender
comes
thy
love
the
heart
of
night
when
all
the
stars
are
sown
across
the
space
with
the
immense
unknown
in
silence
face
to
face
we
stand
in
speechless
awe
while
beauty
marches
by
and
wonder
at
the
law
which
wears
such
majesty
how
small
a
thing
is
man
in
all
that
vast
that
he
should
hope
or
plan
or
dream
his
dream
could
last
o
doubter
of
the
light
confused
by
fear
and
wrong
lean
on
the
heart
of
night
and
let
love
make
thee
strong
the
good
that
is
the
true
is
clothed
with
beauty
still
lo
in
their
tent
of
blue
the
stars
above
the
hill
peace
the
sleeping
tarn
is
dark
below
the
wooded
hill
save
for
its
homing
sounds
the
twilit
world
grows
still
and
i
am
left
to
muse
in
mystery
and
watch
the
stars
come
out
as
sandalled
dusk
goes
by
and
now
the
light
is
gone
the
drowsy
murmurs
cease
and
through
the
still
unknown
i
wonder
whence
comes
peace
then
softly
falls
the
word
of
one
beyond
a
name
peace
only
comes
to
him
who
guards
his
life
from
shame
who
gives
his
heart
to
love
and
holding
truth
for
guide
girds
him
with
fearless
strength
that
freedom
may
abide
the
old
gray
wall
time
out
of
mind
i
have
stood
fronting
the
frost
and
the
sun
that
the
dream
of
the
world
might
endure
and
the
goodly
will
be
done
did
the
hand
of
the
builder
guess
as
he
laid
me
stone
by
stone
a
heart
in
the
granite
lurked
patient
and
fond
as
his
own
lovers
have
leaned
on
me
under
the
summer
moon
and
mowers
laughed
in
my
shade
in
the
harvest
heat
at
noon
children
roving
the
fields
with
early
flowers
in
spring
old
men
turning
to
look
when
they
heard
a
bluebird
sing
have
seen
me
a
thousand
times
standing
here
in
the
sun
yet
never
a
moment
dreamed
whose
likeness
they
gazed
upon
ah
when
will
ye
understand
mortals
who
strive
and
plod
who
rests
on
this
old
gray
wall
lays
a
hand
on
the
shoulder
of
god
te
deum
if
i
could
paint
you
the
autumn
color
the
melting
glow
upon
all
things
laid
the
violet
haze
of
indian
summer
before
its
splendor
begins
to
fade
when
scarlet
has
reached
its
breathless
moment
and
gold
the
hush
of
its
glory
now
that
were
a
mightier
craft
than
titian
the
heart
to
lift
and
the
head
to
bow
i
should
be
lord
of
a
world
of
rapture
master
of
magic
and
gladness
too
the
touch
of
wonder
transcending
science
the
solace
escaping
from
line
and
hue
i
would
reveal
through
tint
and
texture
the
very
soul
of
this
earth
of
ours
forever
yearning
through
boundless
beauty
to
exalt
the
spirit
with
all
her
powers
see
where
it
lies
by
the
lake
this
morning
our
autumn
hillside
of
hardwood
trees
a
masterpiece
of
the
mighty
painter
who
works
in
the
primal
mysteries
a
living
tapestry
rich
and
glowing
with
blended
marvels
vermilion
and
dun
hung
out
for
the
pageant
of
time
that
passes
along
an
avenue
of
the
sun
the
crown
of
the
ash
is
tinged
with
purple
the
hickory
leaves
are
etruscan
gold
and
the
lifts
yellow
banners
against
the
blue
for
a
signal
bold
the
oaks
in
crimson
cohorts
stand
a
myriad
sumach
torches
mass
in
festal
pomp
and
victorious
pride
when
the
vision
of
spring
is
brought
to
pass
down
from
the
line
of
the
shore
deep
shadows
another
and
softer
picture
lies
as
if
the
soul
of
the
lake
in
slumber
should
harbor
a
dream
of
paradise
passive
and
blurred
and
unsubstantial
lulling
the
sense
and
luring
the
mind
with
the
spell
of
an
empty
fairy
world
where
sinew
and
sap
are
left
behind
so
men
dream
of
a
heaven
of
power
and
knowledge
and
endless
joy
asleep
to
the
moment
fine
elation
dull
to
the
day
divine
employ
musing
over
a
phantom
image
born
of
fantastic
hope
and
fear
of
the
very
happiness
life
engenders
and
earth
provides
our
privilege
here
dare
we
dispel
a
single
transport
neglect
the
worth
that
is
here
and
now
yet
dream
of
enjoying
its
shadowy
semblance
in
the
somewhere
somehow
i
heard
the
wind
on
the
hillside
whisper
they
ill
prepare
for
a
journey
hence
who
waste
the
senses
and
starve
the
spirit
in
a
world
all
made
for
spirit
and
sense
is
the
full
stream
fed
from
a
stifled
source
or
the
ripe
fruit
filled
from
a
blighted
flower
are
not
the
brook
and
the
blossom
greatened
through
many
a
busy
beatified
hour
not
in
the
shadow
but
in
the
substance
plastic
and
potent
at
our
command
are
all
the
wisdom
and
gladness
of
heart
this
is
the
kingdom
of
heaven
at
hand
so
i
will
pass
through
the
lovely
world
and
partake
of
beauty
to
feed
my
soul
with
earth
my
domain
and
growth
my
portion
how
should
i
sue
for
a
further
dole
in
the
lift
i
feel
of
immortal
rapture
in
the
flying
glimpse
i
gain
of
truth
released
is
the
passion
that
sought
perfection
assuaged
the
ardor
of
dreamful
youth
the
patience
of
time
shall
teach
me
courage
the
strength
of
the
sun
shall
lend
me
poise
i
would
give
thanks
for
the
autumn
glory
for
the
teaching
of
earth
and
all
her
joys
her
fine
fruition
shall
well
suffice
me
the
air
shall
stir
in
my
veins
like
wine
while
the
moment
waits
and
the
wonder
deepens
my
life
shall
merge
with
the
life
divine
in
october
now
come
the
rosy
dogwoods
the
golden
and
the
scarlet
yellow
maple
to
make
a
day
for
me
the
on
the
ridges
the
alders
in
the
swamp
put
on
their
red
and
purple
to
join
the
autumn
pomp
the
woodbine
hangs
her
crimson
along
the
pasture
wall
and
all
the
bannered
sumacs
have
heard
the
frosty
call
who
then
so
dead
to
valor
as
not
to
raise
a
cheer
when
all
the
woods
are
marching
in
triumph
of
the
year
by
still
waters
leadeth
me
beside
the
still
waters
he
restoreth
my
my
tent
stands
in
a
garden
of
aster
and
goldenrod
tilled
by
the
rain
and
the
sunshine
and
sown
by
the
hand
of
god
an
old
new
england
pasture
abandoned
to
peace
and
time
and
by
the
magic
of
beauty
reclaimed
to
the
sublime
about
it
are
golden
woodlands
of
tulip
and
hickory
on
the
open
ridge
behind
it
you
may
mount
to
a
glimpse
of
sea
the
blue
homeric
rim
of
the
world
great
shield
a
border
of
boundless
glamor
for
the
soul
familiar
field
in
purple
and
lichen
the
boulders
lie
in
the
sun
along
its
grassy
footpath
the
rabbits
run
the
crickets
work
and
chirrup
through
the
still
afternoon
and
the
owl
calls
from
the
hillside
under
the
frosty
moon
the
odorous
wild
grape
clambers
over
the
tumbling
wall
and
through
the
autumnal
quiet
the
chestnuts
open
and
fall
sharing
time
freshness
and
fragrance
part
of
the
earth
great
soul
here
man
spirit
may
ripen
to
wisdom
serene
and
whole
shall
we
not
grow
with
the
asters
never
reluctant
nor
sad
not
counting
the
cost
of
being
living
to
dare
and
be
glad
shall
we
not
lift
with
the
crickets
a
chorus
of
ready
cheer
braving
the
frost
of
oblivion
quick
to
be
happy
here
is
my
will
as
sweet
as
the
wild
grape
spreading
delight
on
the
air
for
the
enchantment
subtle
and
unaware
have
i
as
brave
a
spirit
sprung
from
the
mould
as
this
weed
from
its
own
contentment
lifting
its
shaft
of
gold
the
deep
red
cones
of
the
sumach
and
the
woodbine
crimson
sprays
have
bannered
the
common
roadside
for
the
pageant
of
passing
days
these
are
the
oracles
nature
fills
with
her
holy
breath
giving
them
glory
of
color
transcending
the
shadow
of
death
here
in
the
sifted
sunlight
a
spirit
seems
to
brood
on
the
beauty
and
worth
of
being
in
tranquil
instinctive
mood
and
the
heart
filled
full
of
gladness
such
as
the
wise
earth
knows
wells
with
a
full
thanksgiving
for
the
gifts
that
life
bestows
for
the
ancient
and
virile
nurture
of
the
teeming
primordial
ground
for
the
splendid
gospel
of
color
the
rapt
revelations
of
sound
for
the
above
us
and
the
rusted
gold
of
the
fern
for
the
chickadee
call
of
valor
bidding
the
turn
for
fire
and
running
water
snowfall
and
summer
rain
for
sunsets
and
quiet
meadows
the
fruit
and
the
standing
grain
for
the
solemn
hour
of
moonrise
over
the
crest
of
trees
when
the
mellow
lights
are
kindled
in
the
lamps
of
the
centuries
for
those
who
wrought
aforetime
led
by
the
mystic
strain
to
strive
for
the
larger
freedom
and
live
for
the
greater
gain
for
plenty
of
peace
and
playtime
the
homely
goods
of
earth
and
for
rare
immaterial
treasures
accounted
of
little
worth
for
art
and
learning
and
friendship
where
beneficent
truth
is
supreme
those
everlasting
cities
built
on
the
hills
of
dream
for
all
things
growing
and
goodly
that
foster
this
life
and
breed
the
immortal
flower
of
wisdom
out
of
the
mortal
seed
but
most
of
all
for
the
spirit
that
can
not
rest
nor
bide
in
stale
and
sterile
convenience
nor
safety
proven
and
tried
but
still
inspired
and
driven
must
seek
what
better
may
be
and
up
from
the
loveliest
garden
must
climb
for
a
glimpse
of
sea
lines
for
a
picture
when
the
leaves
are
flying
across
the
azure
sky
autumn
on
the
hill
top
turns
to
say
in
her
tunic
like
an
eastern
queen
with
untarnished
courage
in
her
wilding
mien
all
the
earth
below
her
answers
to
her
gaze
and
her
eyes
are
pensive
with
remembered
days
yet
with
cheek
ensanguined
gay
at
heart
she
goes
on
the
great
adventure
where
the
north
wind
blows
the
deserted
pasture
i
love
the
stony
pasture
that
no
one
else
will
have
the
old
gray
rocks
so
friendly
seem
so
durable
and
brave
in
tranquil
contemplation
it
watches
through
the
year
seeing
the
frosty
stars
arise
the
slender
moons
appear
its
music
is
the
its
choristers
the
birds
and
there
are
secrets
in
its
heart
too
wonderful
for
words
it
keeps
the
creatures
that
play
about
its
walls
though
long
ago
its
milking
herds
were
banished
from
their
stalls
only
the
children
come
there
for
buttercups
in
may
or
nuts
in
autumn
where
it
lies
dreaming
the
hours
away
long
since
its
strength
was
given
to
making
good
increase
and
now
its
soul
is
turned
again
to
beauty
and
to
peace
there
in
the
early
springtime
the
violets
are
blue
and
in
coats
of
gold
are
garmented
anew
there
bayberry
and
aster
are
crowded
on
its
floors
when
marching
summer
halts
to
praise
the
lord
of
and
there
october
passes
in
gorgeous
livery
in
purple
ash
and
crimson
oak
and
golden
tulip
tree
and
when
the
winds
of
winter
their
bugle
blasts
begin
the
snowy
hosts
of
heaven
arrive
and
pitch
their
tents
therein
autumn
now
when
the
time
of
fruit
and
grain
is
come
when
apples
hang
above
the
orchard
wall
and
from
the
tangle
by
the
roadside
stream
a
scent
of
wild
grapes
fills
the
racy
air
comes
autumn
with
her
sunburnt
caravan
like
a
long
gypsy
train
with
trappings
gay
and
tattered
colors
of
the
orient
moving
through
the
dreamy
hills
the
woods
of
wilton
at
her
coming
wear
tints
of
bokhara
and
of
samarcand
the
maples
glow
with
their
pompeian
red
the
hickories
with
burnt
etruscan
gold
and
while
the
crickets
fife
along
her
march
behind
her
banners
burns
the
crimson
sun
november
twilight
now
winter
at
the
end
of
day
along
the
ridges
takes
her
way
upon
her
twilight
round
to
light
the
faithful
candles
of
the
night
as
quiet
as
the
nun
she
goes
with
silver
lamp
in
hand
to
close
the
silent
doors
of
dusk
that
keep
the
hours
of
memory
and
sleep
she
pauses
to
tread
out
the
fires
where
autumn
festal
train
retires
the
last
red
embers
smoulder
down
behind
the
steeples
of
the
town
austere
and
fine
the
trees
stand
bare
and
moveless
in
the
frosty
air
against
the
pure
and
paling
light
before
the
threshold
of
the
night
on
purple
valley
and
dim
wood
the
timeless
hush
of
solitude
is
laid
as
if
the
time
for
some
transcending
mystery
were
come
that
shall
illumine
and
console
the
penitent
and
eager
soul
setting
her
free
to
stand
before
supernal
beauty
and
adore
dear
heart
in
heaven
high
portico
it
is
the
hour
of
prayer
and
lo
above
the
earth
serene
and
still
one
star
our
star
lonetree
hill
the
of
the
goldenrod
when
the
first
silent
frost
has
trod
the
of
the
goldenrod
and
laid
the
blight
of
his
cold
hand
upon
the
warm
autumnal
land
and
all
things
wait
the
subtle
change
that
men
call
death
is
it
not
strange
that
i
without
a
care
or
need
who
only
am
an
idle
weed
should
wait
unmoved
so
frail
so
bold
the
coming
of
the
final
cold
before
the
snow
now
soon
ah
very
soon
i
know
the
trumpets
of
the
north
will
blow
and
the
great
winds
will
come
to
bring
the
pale
wild
riders
of
the
snow
darkening
the
sun
with
level
flight
at
arrowy
speed
they
will
alight
unnumbered
as
the
desert
sands
to
bivouac
on
the
edge
of
night
then
i
within
their
somber
ring
shall
hear
a
voice
that
seems
to
sing
deep
deep
within
my
tranquil
heart
the
valiant
prophecy
of
spring
winter
when
winter
comes
along
the
river
line
and
earth
has
put
away
her
green
attire
with
all
the
pomp
of
her
autumnal
pride
the
world
is
made
a
sanctuary
old
where
gothic
trees
uphold
the
arch
of
gray
and
gaunt
stone
fences
on
the
ridge
crest
stand
like
carved
screens
before
a
crimson
shrine
showing
the
sunset
glory
through
the
chinks
there
like
a
nun
with
frosty
breath
the
soul
uplift
in
adoration
sees
the
world
transfigured
to
a
temple
of
her
lord
while
down
the
soft
aisles
of
snow
night
like
a
sacristan
with
silent
step
passes
to
light
the
tapers
of
the
stars
a
winter
piece
over
the
rim
of
a
lacquered
bowl
where
a
cold
blue
stands
i
see
the
wintry
breakers
roll
and
heave
their
froth
up
the
freezing
sands
here
in
immunity
safe
and
dull
soul
treads
her
circuit
of
trivial
things
there
soul
brother
a
shining
gull
dares
the
rough
weather
on
dauntless
wings
winter
streams
now
the
little
rivers
go
muffled
safely
under
snow
and
the
winding
meadow
streams
murmur
in
their
wintry
dreams
while
a
tinkling
music
wells
faintly
from
there
icy
bells
telling
how
their
hearts
are
bold
though
the
very
sun
be
cold
ah
but
wait
until
the
rain
comes
once
again
sweeping
softly
from
the
sound
over
ridge
and
meadow
ground
then
the
little
streams
will
hear
april
calling
far
and
near
slip
their
snowy
bands
and
run
sparkling
in
the
welcome
sun
winter
twilight
along
the
wintry
skyline
crowning
the
rocky
crest
stands
the
bare
screen
of
hardwood
trees
against
the
saffron
west
its
gray
and
purple
network
of
branching
tracery
outspread
upon
the
lucent
air
like
weed
within
the
sea
the
scarlet
robe
of
autumn
renounced
and
put
away
the
mystic
earth
is
fairer
still
a
puritan
in
gray
the
spirit
of
the
winter
how
tender
how
austere
yet
all
the
ardor
of
the
spring
and
summer
dream
are
here
fear
not
o
timid
lover
the
touch
of
frost
and
rime
this
is
the
virtue
that
sustained
the
roses
in
their
prime
the
anthem
of
the
northwind
shall
hallow
thy
despair
the
benediction
of
the
snow
be
answer
to
thy
prayer
and
now
the
star
of
evening
that
is
the
pilgrim
sign
is
lighted
in
the
primrose
dusk
a
lamp
before
a
shrine
peace
fills
the
mighty
minster
tranquil
and
gray
and
old
and
all
the
chancel
of
the
west
is
bright
with
paling
gold
a
little
wind
goes
sifting
along
the
meadow
floor
like
steps
of
lovely
penitents
who
sighingly
adore
then
falls
the
twilight
curtain
and
fades
the
eerie
light
and
frost
and
silence
turn
the
keys
in
the
great
doors
of
night
the
twelfth
night
star
it
is
the
bitter
time
of
year
when
iron
is
the
ground
with
hasp
and
sheathing
of
black
ice
the
forest
lakes
are
bound
the
world
lies
snugly
under
snow
asleep
without
a
sound
all
the
night
long
in
trooping
squares
the
sentry
stars
go
by
the
silent
and
unwearying
hosts
that
bear
man
company
and
with
their
pure
enkindling
fires
keep
vigils
lone
and
high
through
the
dead
hours
before
the
dawn
when
the
frost
snaps
the
sill
from
ridge
to
sea
the
earth
lies
dark
and
still
till
one
great
silver
planet
shines
above
the
eastern
hill
it
is
the
star
of
gabriel
the
herald
of
the
word
in
days
when
messengers
of
god
with
sons
of
men
conferred
who
brought
the
tidings
of
great
joy
the
watching
shepherds
heard
the
mystic
light
that
moved
to
lead
the
wise
of
long
ago
out
of
the
great
east
where
they
dreamed
of
truths
they
could
not
know
to
seek
some
good
that
should
assuage
the
world
most
ancient
woe
o
well
believe
they
loved
their
dream
those
children
of
the
star
who
saw
the
light
and
followed
it
prophetical
afar
brave
caspar
melchior
and
eager
balthasar
another
year
slips
to
the
void
and
still
with
omen
bright
above
the
sleeping
doubting
world
the
is
alight
the
waking
signal
flashed
of
old
in
the
blue
syrian
night
but
who
are
now
as
wise
as
they
whose
faith
could
read
the
sign
of
the
three
gifts
that
shall
suffice
to
honor
the
divine
and
show
the
tread
of
common
life
ineffably
benign
whoever
wakens
on
a
day
happy
to
know
and
be
to
enjoy
the
air
to
love
his
kind
to
labor
to
be
free
already
his
enraptured
soul
lives
in
eternity
for
him
with
every
rising
sun
the
year
begins
anew
the
fertile
earth
receives
her
lord
and
prophecy
comes
true
wondrously
as
a
fall
of
snow
dear
as
a
drench
of
dew
who
gives
his
life
for
beauty
need
king
caspar
could
no
more
who
serves
the
truth
with
single
mind
shall
stand
with
melchior
and
love
is
all
that
balthasar
in
crested
censer
bore
a
christmas

halleluja
halleluja
christmas
song
above
the
weary
waiting
world
asleep
in
chill
despair
there
breaks
a
sound
of
joyous
bells
upon
the
frosted
air
and
the
humblest
rooftree
lo
a
star
is
dancing
on
the
snow
what
makes
the
yellow
star
to
dance
upon
the
brink
of
night
what
makes
the
breaking
dawn
to
glow
so
magically
bright
and
all
the
earth
to
be
renewed
with
infinite
beatitude
the
singing
bells
the
throbbing
star
the
sunbeams
on
the
snow
and
the
awakening
heart
that
leaps
new
ecstasy
to
know
they
all
are
dancing
in
the
morn
because
a
little
child
is
born
the
wise
men
from
the
east
a
little
boy
christmas
lesson
were
the
wise
men
three
instead
of
five
or
seven
they
had
to
match
you
see
the
archangels
in
heaven
god
sent
them
sure
and
swift
by
his
mysterious
presage
to
bear
the
threefold
gift
and
take
the
threefold
message
thus
in
their
hands
were
seen
the
gold
of
purest
beauty
the
myrrh
of
truth
the
frankincense
of
duty
and
thus
they
bore
away
the
loving
heart
great
treasure
and
knowledge
clear
as
day
to
be
our
life
new
measure
they
went
back
to
the
east
to
spread
the
news
of
gladness
there
one
became
a
priest
to
the
new
word
of
sadness
and
one
a
workman
skilled
beyond
the
old
earth
fashion
and
one
a
scholar
filled
with
learning
endless
passion
god
sent
them
for
a
sign
he
would
not
change
nor
alter
his
good
and
fair
design
however
man
may
falter
he
meant
that
as
he
chose
his
perfect
plan
and
willed
it
they
stood
in
place
of
those
who
elsewhere
had
fulfilled
it
whoso
would
mark
and
reach
the
height
of
man
election
must
still
achieve
and
teach
the
triplicate
perfection
for
since
the
world
was
made
one
thing
was
needed
ever
to
keep
man
undismayed
through
failure
and
endeavor
a
faultless
trinity
of
body
mind
and
spirit
and
each
with
its
own
three
strong
angels
to
be
near
it
strength
to
arise
and
go
wherever
dawn
is
breaking
poise
like
the
tides
that
flow
instinct
for
imagination
bold
to
cross
the
mystic
border
reason
to
seek
and
hold
judgment
for
law
and
order
joy
that
makes
all
things
well
faith
that
is
each
terror
to
dispel
and
love
ah
love
unfailing
these
are
the
flaming
nine
who
walk
the
world
unsleeping
sent
forth
by
the
divine
with
manhood
in
their
keeping
these
are
the
seraphs
strong
his
mighty
soul
had
need
of
when
he
would
right
the
wrong
and
sorrow
he
took
heed
of
and
that
i
think
is
why
the
wise
men
knelt
before
him
and
put
their
kingdoms
by
to
serve
him
and
adore
him
so
that
our
lord
unknown
should
not
be
unattended
when
he
was
here
alone
and
poor
and
unbefriended
that
still
he
might
have
three
rather
than
five
or
seven
to
stand
in
their
degree
like
archangels
in
heaven
the
sending
of
the
magi
in
a
far
eastern
country
it
happened
long
of
yore
where
a
lone
and
level
sunrise
flushes
the
desert
floor
that
three
kings
sat
together
and
a
spearman
kept
the
door
caspar
whose
wealth
was
counted
by
city
and
caravan
with
melchior
the
seer
who
read
the
starry
plan
and
balthasar
the
blameless
who
loved
his
fellow
man
there
while
they
talked
a
sudden
strange
rushing
sound
arose
and
as
with
startled
faces
they
thought
upon
their
foes
three
figures
stood
before
them
in
imperial
repose
one
in
and
one
in
blue
and
one
in
scarlet
clear
with
the
almighty
portent
of
sunrise
they
drew
near
and
the
kings
made
obeisance
with
hand
on
breast
in
fear
arise
said
they
we
bring
you
good
tidings
of
great
peace
a
power
is
wakened
whose
working
must
increase
till
fear
and
greed
and
malice
and
violence
shall
cease
the
messengers
were
michael
by
whom
all
things
are
wrought
to
shape
and
hue
and
gabriel
who
is
the
lord
of
thought
and
rafael
without
whose
love
all
toil
must
come
to
nought
then
rafael
said
to
balthasar
in
a
country
west
from
here
a
lord
is
born
in
lowliness
in
love
without
a
peer
take
grievances
and
gifts
to
him
and
prove
his
kingship
clear
by
this
sign
ye
shall
know
him
within
his
mother
arm
among
the
cattle
he
slumbers
without
harm
while
wicked
hearts
are
troubled
and
tyrants
take
alarm
and
gabriel
said
to
melchior
my
comrade
i
will
send
my
star
to
go
before
you
that
ye
may
comprehend
where
leads
your
mystic
learning
in
a
humaner
trend
and
michael
said
to
gaspar
thou
royal
builder
go
with
tribute
of
thy
riches
though
time
shall
overthrow
thy
kingdom
no
undoing
his
gentle
might
shall
know
then
while
the
kings
hearts
greatened
and
all
the
chamber
shone
as
when
the
hills
at
sundown
take
a
new
glory
on
and
the
air
thrills
with
purple
their
visitors
were
gone
then
straightway
up
rose
gaspar
melchior
and
balthasar
and
passed
out
through
the
murmur
of
palace
and
bazar
to
make
without
misgiving
the
journey
of
the
star
the
angels
of
man
the
word
of
the
lord
of
the
outer
worlds
went
forth
on
the
deeps
of
space
that
michael
gabriel
rafael
should
stand
before
his
face
the
seraphs
of
his
threefold
will
each
in
his
ordered
place
brave
michael
the
right
hand
of
god
strong
gabriel
his
voice
fair
rafael
his
holy
breath
that
makes
the
world
rejoice
archangels
of
omnipotence
of
knowledge
and
of
choice
michael
angel
of
loveliness
in
all
things
that
survive
and
gabriel
whose
part
it
is
to
ponder
and
contrive
and
rafael
who
puts
the
heart
in
every
thing
alive
came
rafael
the
enraptured
soul
stainless
as
wind
or
fire
the
urge
within
the
flux
of
things
the
life
that
must
aspire
with
whom
is
the
beginning
the
worth
and
the
desire
and
gabriel
the
mind
bringer
of
truth
and
light
who
lays
the
courses
of
the
stars
in
their
stupendous
flight
and
calls
the
migrant
flocks
of
spring
across
the
purple
night
and
michael
the
artificer
of
beauty
shape
and
hue
lord
of
the
forges
of
the
sun
the
crucible
of
the
dew
and
driver
of
the
plowing
rain
when
the
flowers
are
born
anew
then
said
the
lord
ye
shall
account
for
the
ministry
ye
hold
since
ye
have
been
my
sons
to
keep
my
purpose
from
of
old
how
fare
the
realms
within
your
sway
to
perfections
still
untold
answered
each
as
he
had
the
word
and
a
great
silence
fell
on
all
the
listening
hosts
of
heaven
to
hear
their
captains
tell
with
the
breath
of
the
wind
the
call
of
a
bird
and
the
cry
of
a
mighty
bell
then
the
lord
said
the
time
is
ripe
for
finishing
my
plan
and
the
accomplishment
of
that
for
which
all
time
began
therefore
on
you
is
laid
the
task
of
the
fashioning
of
man
in
your
own
likeness
shall
he
be
to
triumph
in
the
end
i
only
give
him
michael
strength
to
guard
him
and
defend
with
gabriel
to
be
his
guide
and
rafael
his
friend
ye
shall
go
forth
upon
the
earth
and
make
there
paradise
and
be
the
angels
of
that
place
to
make
men
glad
and
wise
with
in
their
hearts
and
knowledge
in
their
eyes
and
ye
shall
be
man
counsellors
that
neither
rest
nor
sleep
to
cheer
the
lonely
lift
the
frail
and
solace
them
that
weep
and
ever
on
his
wandering
trail
your
ye
shall
keep
till
in
the
far
years
he
shall
find
the
country
of
his
quest
the
empire
of
the
open
truth
the
vision
of
the
best
foreseen
by
every
mother
saint
with
her
on
her
breast
at
the
making
of
man
all
the
host
of
raphael
in
liveries
of
gold
lifted
the
chorus
on
whose
rhythm
the
spinning
spheres
are
rolled
the
seraphs
of
the
morning
calm
whose
hearts
are
never
he
shall
be
born
a
spirit
part
of
the
soul
that
yearns
the
core
of
vital
gladness
that
suffers
and
discerns
the
stir
that
breaks
the
budding
sheath
when
the
green
spring
returns
the
gist
of
power
and
patience
hid
in
the
plasmic
clay
the
calm
behind
the
senses
the
passionate
essay
to
make
his
wise
and
lovely
dream
immortal
on
a
day
the
soft
aprilian
ardors
that
warm
the
waiting
loam
shall
whisper
in
his
pulses
to
bid
him
overcome
and
he
shall
learn
the
beneath
the
azure
dome
and
though
nature
should
teach
him
to
deplore
the
ruddy
fires
of
autumn
shall
lure
him
but
the
more
to
pass
from
joy
to
stronger
joy
as
through
an
open
door
he
shall
have
hope
and
honor
proud
trust
and
courage
stark
to
hold
him
to
his
purpose
through
the
unlighted
dark
and
love
that
sees
the
moon
full
orb
in
the
first
silver
arc
and
he
shall
live
by
kindness
and
the
heart
certitude
which
moves
without
misgiving
in
ways
not
understood
sure
only
of
the
vast
event
the
large
and
simple
good
gabriel
host
in
silver
gear
and
vesture
twilight
blue
the
spirits
of
immortal
mind
the
warders
of
the
true
took
up
the
theme
that
gives
the
world
significance
he
shall
be
born
to
reason
and
have
the
primal
need
to
understand
and
follow
wherever
truth
may
lead
to
grow
in
wisdom
like
a
tree
unfolding
from
a
seed
a
watcher
by
the
sheepfolds
with
wonder
in
his
eyes
he
shall
behold
the
seasons
and
mark
the
planets
rise
till
all
the
marching
firmament
shall
rouse
his
vast
surmise
beyond
the
sweep
of
vision
or
utmost
reach
of
sound
this
cunning
this
tiller
of
the
ground
shall
learn
the
secrets
of
the
suns
and
fathom
the
profound
for
he
must
prove
all
being
sane
beauteous
benign
and
at
the
heart
of
nature
discover
the
divine
himself
the
type
and
symbol
of
the
eternal
trine
he
shall
perceive
the
kindling
of
knowledge
far
and
dim
as
of
the
fire
that
brightens
below
the
dark
when
ray
by
ray
the
splendid
sun
floats
to
the
world
wide
brim
and
out
of
primal
instinct
the
lore
of
lair
and
den
he
shall
emerge
to
question
how
wherefore
whence
and
when
till
the
last
frontier
of
the
truth
shall
lie
within
his
ken
michael
host
took
up
the
word
and
sang
as
though
a
trumpet
had
been
loosed
in
heaven
the
arches
rang
for
these
were
they
who
feel
the
thrill
of
beauty
like
a
he
shall
be
framed
and
balanced
for
loveliness
and
power
lithe
as
the
supple
creatures
and
colored
as
a
flower
sustained
by
the
earth
nurtured
by
wind
and
shower
to
stand
within
the
vortex
where
surging
forces
play
a
poised
and
pliant
figure
immutable
as
they
till
time
and
space
and
energy
surrenders
to
his
sway
he
shall
be
free
to
journey
over
the
teeming
earth
an
insatiable
seeker
a
wanderer
from
his
birth
clothed
in
the
fragile
veil
of
sense
with
fortitude
for
girth
his
hands
shall
have
dominion
of
all
created
things
to

loud
in

praises
for

the

older

wrought

tears
the
grief
of
angels
fell
from
zamcaca
sorrowing
hopeless
alone
for
her
people
sick
from
injustice
distraught
and
disheartened
tortured
by
sight
and
sound
of
wrong
and
ruin
when
the
kind
silent
tropical
moonlight
lay
on
the
city
in
the
dead
hour
when
the
soul
trembles
within
the
portals
of
its
own
province
while
far
away
seem
all
deeds
of
daytime
she
rose
and
wondered
gazed
on
the
sleeping
face
of
her

one
alien
and
cruel
kissed
her
strange
children
longingly
laying
a
hand
in
farewell
on
each
crept
to
the
door
and
fled
back
to
the
forest
only
the
deep
heart
of
the
brooding
below
the
storms
of
human
madness
can
know
what
desolate
anguish
possessed
her
only
the
far
mind
of
the
seeing
the
mystic
end
and
beginning
knows
why
the
pageant
is
so
betattered
with
mortal
sorrow
on
the
plaza
one
august
day
i
sat
beside
a
café
window
open
wide
to
let
the
air
blow
in
across
the
plaza
where
in
golden
pomp
against
the
dark
green
leafy
background
of
the
park
gaudens
hero
gaunt
and
grim
rides
on
with
victory
leading
him
the
wet
black
asphalt
seemed
to
hold
in
every
hollow
pools
of
gold
and
clouds
of
gold
and
pink
and
gray
were
piled
up
at
the
end
of
day
far
down
the
cross
street
where
one
tower
still
glistened
from
the
drenching
shower
a
weary
man
went
by
cooling
his
forehead
gratefully
after
the
day
great
heat
a
girl
her
thin
white
garments
in
a
swirl
blown
back
against
her
breasts
and
knees
like
a
winged
victory
in
the
breeze
alive
and
modern
and
superb
crossed
from
the
circle
of
the
curb
we
sat
there
watching
people
pass
clinking
the
ice
against
the
glass
and
talking
idly
books
or
art
or
something
equally
apart
from
the
essential
stress
and
strife
that
rudely
form
and
further
life
glad
of
a
respite
from
the
heat
when
down
the
middle
of
the
street
trundling
a
gay
in
spite
of
the
day
three
came
the
man
with
hair
and
beard
as
black
as
pan
strolled
on
one
side
with
lordly
grace
while
a
young
girl
tugged
at
a
trace
upon
the
other
and
between
the
shafts
there
walked
a
laughing
queen
bright
as
a
poppy
strong
and
free
what
likelier
land
than
italy
breeds
such
abandon
confident
and
rapturous
in
mere
living
spent
each
moment
to
the
utmost
there
with
broad
deep
chest
and
kerchiefed
hair
with
head
thrown
back
bare
throat
and
waist
supple
heroic
and
between
her
two
companions
walked
this
splendid
woman
chaffed
and
talked
did
half
the
work
made
all
the
cheer
of
that
small
company
no
fear
of
failure
in
a
soul
like
hers
that
every
moment
throbs
and
stirs
with
merry
ardor
virile
hope
brave
effort
nor
in
all
its
scope
has
room
for
thought
or
discontent
each
day
its
own
sufficient
vent
and
source
of
happiness
without
a
trace
of
bitterness
or
doubt
of
life
true
worth
she
strode
at
ease
before
those
empty
palaces
a
simple
heiress
of
the
earth
and
all
its
joys
by
happy
birth
beneficent
as
breeze
or
dew
and
fresh
as
though
the
world
were
new
and
toil
and
grief
were
not
how
rare
a
personality
was
there
a
painter
holiday
we
painters
sometimes
strangely
keep
these
holidays
when
life
runs
deep
and
broad
and
strong
it
comes
to
make
its
own
almanack
impulse
and
incident
divine
must
find
their
way
through
tone
and
line
the
throb
of
color
and
the
dream
of
beauty
giving
art
its
theme
from
dear
life
daily
miracle
illume
the
artist
life
as
well
a
or
a
turning
leaf
the
first
white
fall
of
snow
a
brief
wild
song
from
the
anthology
a
smile
or
a
girl
kindling
eye
and
there
is
worth
enough
for
him
to
make
the
page
of
history
dim
who
knows
upon
what
day
may
come
the
touch
of
that
delirium
which
lifts
plain
life
to
the
divine
and
teaches
hand
the
magic
line
no
cunning
rule
could
ever
reach
where
soul
necessities
find
speech
none
knows
how
rapture
may
arrive
to
be
our
helper
and
survive
through
our
essay
to
help
in
turn
all
starving
eager
souls
who
yearn
lightward
discouraged
and
distraught
ah
once
art
gleam
of
glory
caught
and
treasured
in
the
heart
how
then
we
walk
enchanted
among
men
and
with
the
elder
gods
confer
so
art
is
hope
interpreter
and
with
devotion
must
conspire
to
fan
the
eternal
altar
fire
wherefore
you
find
me
here
not
idling
the
good
hours
away
but
picturing
a
magic
hour
with
its
replenishment
of
power
conceive
a
bleak
december
day
the
streets
all
mire
the
sky
all
gray
and
a
poor
painter
trudging
home
disconsolate
when
what
should
come
across
his
vision
but
a
line
on
a
sign
persian
sun
in
he
turns
a
step
and
there
the
desert
burns
purple
and
splendid
molten
gold
the
streamers
of
the
dawn
unfold
amber
and
amethyst
uphurled
above
the
far
rim
of
the
world
the
sound
of
temple
bells
over
the
hot
sand
steals
and
swells
a
lazy
throbs
and
dones
in
barbarous
maddening
monotones
while
sandal
incense
blue
and
keen
hangs
in
the
air
and
then
the
scene
wakes
and
out
steps
by
rhythm
released
the
sorcery
of
all
the
east
in
rose
and
saffron
gossamer
a
young
worshipper
who
dances
up
the
sun
she
moves
like
waking
woodland
flower
that
loves
to
greet
the
day
her
lithe
brown
curve
is
like
a
sapling
sway
and
swerve
before
the
spring
wind
her
dark
hair
framing
a
face
vivid
and
rare
curled
to
her
throat
and
then
flew
wild
like
shadows
round
a
radiant
child
the
sunlight
from
her
cymbals
played
about
her
dancing
knees
and
made
a
world
of
ecstasy
prophetic
of
the
day
to
be
such
mystic
beauty
might
have
shone
in
sardis
or
in
babylon
to
bring
a
satrap
to
his
doom
or
touch
some
lad
with
glory
bloom
and
now
it
wrought
for
me
with
sheer
enchantment
of
the
dying
year
its
irresistible
reprieve
from
joylessness
on
new
year
eve
mirage
here
hangs
at
last
you
see
my
row
of
sketches
all
i
have
to
show
of
one
enchanted
summer
spent
in
sweet
laborious
content
at
little
by
the
moors
with
the
sea
thundering
by
its
doors
its
grassy
streets
and
gardens
gay
with
hollyhocks
and
salvia
and
here
upon
the
easel
yet
with
the
last
brush
of
paint
still
wet
showing
how
inspiration
toils
is
one
where
the
white
boils
along
the
sand
and
the
whole
sea
lifts
to
the
skyline
just
to
be
the
wondrous
background
from
whose
verge
of
blue
on
blue
there
should
emerge
this
miracle
one
day
of
days
i
strolled
the
silent
path
that
strays
between
the
moorlands
and
the
beach
from
siasconset
till
you
reach
tom
nevers
head
the
lone
last
land
that
fronts
the
ocean
lone
and
grand
as
when
the
lord
first
bade
it
be
for
a
surprise
and
mystery
a
sailless
sea
a
cloudless
sky
the
level
lonely
moors
and
i
the
only
soul
in
all
that
vast
of
color
made
intense
to
last
the
small
white
piping
near
the
great
soft
and
the
dear
bright
sun
that
pales
each
crest
to
jade
where
gulls
glint
fishing
unafraid
here
man
the
godlike
might
have
gone
with
his
deep
thought
on
that
wild
dawn
when
the
first
sun
came
from
the
sea
glowing
and
kindling
the
world
to
be
while
time
began
and
joy
had
birth
no
wilder
sweeter
spot
on
earth
as
i
sat
there
and
mused
the
way
we
painters
waste
our
time
you
say
on
the
sheer
loneliness
and
strength
whence
life
must
spring
there
came
at
length
conviction
of
the
helplessness
of
earth
alone
to
ban
or
bless
i
saw
the
huge
unhuman
sea
i
heard
the
drear
monotony
of
the
waves
beating
on
the
shore
with
heedless
futile
strife
and
roar
without
a
meaning
or
an
aim
and
then
a
revelation
came
in
subtle
sudden
lovely
guise
like
one
of
those
soft
mysteries
of
indian
jugglers
who
evoke
a
flower
for
you
out
of
smoke
i
knew
sheer
beauty
without
soul
could
never
be
perfection
goal
nor
satisfy
the
seeking
mind
with
all
it
longs
for
and
must
find
one
day
the
lovely
things
that
haunt
our
senses
with
an
aching
want
and
move
our
souls
are
like
the
fair
lost
garments
of
a
soul
somewhere
nature
is
naught
if
not
the
veil
of
some
great
good
that
must
prevail
and
break
in
joy
as
woods
of
spring
break
into
song
and
blossoming
but
what
makes
that
great
goodness
start
within
ourselves
when
leaps
the
heart
with
gladness
only
then
we
know
why
lovely
nature
travails
so
why
art
must
persevere
and
pray
in
her
incomparable
way
in
all
the
world
the
only
worth
is
human
happiness
its
dearth
the
darkest
let
joyance
be
and
there
is
god
sufficiency
such
joy
as
only
can
abound
where
the
heart
comrade
has
been
found
that
was
my
thought
and
then
the
sea
broke
in
upon
my
revery
with
clamorous
beauty
the
superb
eternal
noun
that
takes
no
verb
but
love
the
heaven
of
blue
bent
the
azure
round
and
true
as
magic
sphere
of
crystal
glass
where
faith
sees
plain
the
pageant
pass
of
things
unseen
so
i
beheld
the
sheer
domed
and
belled
as
if
the
sea
were
the
very
floor
of
heaven
where
walked
the
gods
of
yore
in
plato
imagery
and
i
uplifted
saw
their
pomps
go
by
the
house
of
space
and
time
grew
tense
as
if
with
rapture
imminence
when
truth
should
be
at
last
made
clear
and
the
great
worth
of
life
appear
while
i
a
worshipper
at
the
shrine
for
very
longing
grew
divine
borne
upward
on
earth
ecstasy
and
welcomed
by
the
boundless
sky
a
mighty
prescience
seemed
to
brood
over
that
tenuous
solitude
yearning
for
form
till
it
became
vivid
as
dream
and
live
as
flame
through
magic
art
could
never
match
the
vision
i
have
tried
to
catch
all
earth
delight
and
meaning
grown
a
lyric
presence
loved
and
known
how
otherwise
could
time
evolve
young
courage
or
the
high
resolve
or
gladness
to
assuage
and
bless
the
soul
austere
great
loneliness
than
by
providing
her
somehow
with
sympathy
of
hand
and
brow
and
bidding
her
at
last
go
free
companioned
through
eternity
so
there
appeared
before
my
eyes
in
a
beloved
familiar
guise
a
vivid
questing
human
face
in
profile
scanning
heaven
for
grace
there
against
the
blue
with
eyes
that
heaven
itself
shone
through
the
lips
half
in
prayer
half
confident
of
kindness
there
a
brow
like
plato
made
for
dream
in
some
immortal
academe
and
tender
as
a
happy
girl
a
full
dark
head
of
clustered
curls
round
as
an
emperor
where
meet
repose
and
ardor
strong
and
sweet
distilling
from
a
mind
unmarred
the
glory
of
her
rapt
regard
so
eager
mary
might
have
stood
in
love
adoring
attitude
and
looked
into
the
angel
eyes
with
faith
and
fearlessness
all
wise
in
soul
unfaltering
innocence
sure
in
her
woman
supersense
of
things
only
the
humble
know
my
vision
looks
forever
so
in
other
years
when
men
shall
say
what
was
the
painter
meaning
pray
why
all
this
vast
of
sea
and
space
just
to
enframe
a
woman
face
here
is
the
pertinent
reply
what
better
use
for
earth
and
sky
the
great
archangel
passed
that
way
illuming
life
with
mystic
ray
not
lippo
self
nor
raphael
had
lovelier
realer
things
to
tell
than
i
beholding
far
away
how
all
the
melting
rose
and
gray
upon
the
purple
leaned
about
that
head
that
intervened
how
real
was
she
ah
my
friend
in
art
the
fact
and
fancy
blend
past
telling
all
the
painter
task
is
with
the
glory
need
we
ask
the
tulips
breaking
through
the
mould
to
their
untarnished
age
of
gold
whence
their
ideals
were
derived
that
have
so
gloriously
survived
flowers
and
painters
both
must
give
the
hint
they
have
received
to
live
spend
without
stint
the
joy
and
power
that
lurk
in
each
propitious
hour
yet
leave
the
why
untold
god
way
my
sketch
is
all
i
have
to
say
the
winged
victory
thou
dear
and
most
high
victory
whose
home
is
the
unvanquished
sea
whose
fluttering
garments
keep
the
very
freshness
fold
and
sweep
they
wore
upon
the
galley
prow
by
what
unwonted
favor
now
hast
thou
alighted
in
this
place
thou
victory
of
samothrace
o
thou
to
whom
in
countless
lands
with
eager
hearts
and
striving
hands
strong
men
in
their
last
need
have
prayed
greatly
desiring
undismayed
and
thou
hast
been
across
the
fight
their
consolation
and
their
might
withhold
not
now
one
dearer
grace
thou
victory
of
samothrace
behold
we
too
must
cry
to
thee
who
wage
our
strife
with
destiny
and
give
for
beauty
and
for
truth
our
love
our
valor
and
our
youth
are
there
no
honors
for
these
things
to
match
the
pageantries
of
kings
are
we
more
laggard
in
the
race
than
those
who
fell
at
samothrace
not
only
for
the
bow
and
sword
o
victory
be
thy
reward
the
hands
that
work
with
paint
and
clay
in
beauty
service
shall
not
they
also
with
mighty
faith
prevail
let
hope
not
die
nor
courage
fail
but
joy
come
with
thee
pace
for
pace
as
once
long
since
in
samothrace
grant
us
the
skill
to
shape
the
form
and
spread
the
color
as
they
who
wrought
aforetime
did
where
love
and
wisdom
shall
lie
hid
in
fair
impassioned
types
to
sway
the
cohorts
of
the
world
in
truth
eternal
cause
and
trace
thy
glory
down
from
samothrace
with
all
the
ease
and
splendid
poise
of
one
who
triumphs
without
noise
wilt
thou
not
teach
us
to
attain
thy
sense
of
power
without
strain
that
we
a
little
may
possess
our
souls
with
thy
sure
loveliness
that
calm
the
years
can
not
deface
thou
victory
of
samothrace
then
in
the
ancient
ceaseless
war
with
infamy
go
thou
before
amid
the
shoutings
and
the
drums
let
it
be
learned
that
beauty
comes
man
matchless
paladin
to
be
whose
rule
shall
make
his
spirit
free
as
thine
from
all
things
mean
or
base
thou
victory
of
samothrace
the
gate
of
peace
ah
who
will
build
the
city
of
our
dream
where
beauty
shall
abound
and
truth
avail
with
patient
love
that
is
too
wise
for
strife
blending
in
power
as
gentle
as
the
rain
with
the
reviving
earth
on
full
spring
days
who
now
will
speed
us
to
its
gate
of
peace
and
reassure
us
on
our
doubtful
road
three
centuries
ago
a
fearless
man
yearning
to
set
his
people
in
the
way
threw
all
his
royal
might
into
a
plan
to
found
an
ideal
city
that
should
give
freedom
to
every
instinct
for
the
best
from
humblest
impulse
in
his
own
domain
to
rumored
wisdom
from
the
world
far
ends
strengthened
with
ardor
from
a
high
resolve
beneath
the
patient
smile
of
indian
skies
this
fair
dream
flourished
for
a
score
of
years
until
the
blight
of
evil
touched
its
bloom
with
fading
and
transformed
its
vivid
life
into
a
of
its
fair
design
now
ruined
nursery
tower
and
gay
boudoir
a
sad
custodian
of
sacred
tombs
and
scattered
feathers
from
the
purple
wings
of
doves
who
reign
in
undisputed
calm
over
this
eden
of
hope
and
fair
essay
recall
the
valor
of
this
ancient
quest
great
akbar
grandfather
of
shah
jehan
the
artist
emperor
of
india
who
built
the
taj
for
love
of
one
held
dear
beyond
all
other
women
in
the
world
and
left
that
loveliest
memorial
the
most
supreme
of
wonders
wrought
by
man
to
move
for
very
joy
all
hearts
to
tears
beholding
how
great
beauty
springs
from
love
akbar
the
wisest
ruler
over
ind
grandson
of
babar
in
whose
veins
were
mixed
the
blood
of
tamerlane
and
chinghiz
khan
who
beat
the
afghans
and
the
rajputs
down
at
paniput
and
buxar
in
bengal
making
himself
the
lord
of
hindustan
and
with
his
restless
tartars
founded
there
the
mogul
empire
with
its
moslem
faith
its
joyousness
enlightenment
and
art
akbar
of
all
the
sovereigns
of
the
east
is
still
most
deeply
loved
and
gladly
praised
for
he
who
conquered
with
so
strong
a
hand
cabul
kashmir
and
kandahar
and
sind
oudh
and
orissa
chitor
and
ajmir
with
all
their
wealth
to
weld
them
into
one
upholding
justice
with
his
sovereignty
throughout
his
borders
and
imposing
peace
was
first
and
last
a
seeker
after
truth
no
craven
unlaborious
truce
he
sought
but
that
great
peace
which
only
comes
with
light
emerging
after
chaos
has
been
quelled
in
some
long
struggle
of
enduring
will
to
be
a
proof
of
order
and
of
law
which
can
not
rest
on
falsehood
nor
on
wrong
but
spreads
like
generous
sunshine
on
the
earth
when
goodness
has
been
gained
and
truth
made
clear
at
incalculable
cost
returning
once
with
his
victorious
arms
and
companies
on
the
homeward
march
to
agra
and
his
court
magnificence
from
a
campaign
against
some
turbulent
folk
he
came
at
evening
to
a
quiet
place
near
sikri
by
the
roadside
through
the
woods
where
there
were
many
doves
among
the
trees
there
salim
chisti
a
holy
man
had
made
his
lonely
dwelling
in
the
wilderness
seeking
perfection
and
the
solitude
was
sweet
to
akbar
and
he
halted
there
and
went
to
salim
in
his
lodge
and
said
o
man
and
brother
thy
long
days
are
spent
in
meditation
seeking
for
the
path
through
this
great
world
impediments
to
peace
here
in
the
twilight
with
the
holy
stars
or
when
the
rose
of
morning
breaks
in
gold
tell
me
i
pray
whence
comes
the
gift
of
peace
with
all
its
blessings
for
a
people
need
and
how
may
true
tranquillity
be
found
on
which
man
restless
spirit
longs
to
rest
and
salim
answered
lord
most
readily
in
allah
for
there
men
live
more
truly
being
free
from
false
constraint
for
learning
wisdom
with
a
calmer
mind
for
they
who
would
find
peace
must
conquer
fear
and
ignorance
and
greed
the
ravagers
of
spirit
mind
and
sense
and
learn
to
live
content
beneath
the
shade
of
allah
hand
who
worships
not
his
own
will
shall
find
peace
then
akbar
answered
i
have
set
my
heart
on
making
beauty
truth
and
justice
shine
as
the
ordered
stars
above
the
darkened
earth
are
not
these
also
things
to
be
desired
and
striven
for
with
no
uncertain
toil
and
save
through
them
whence
comes
the
gift
of
peace
then
salim
smiled
and
with
his
finger
drew
in
the
soft
dust
before
his
door
and
said
o
king
thy
words
are
true
thy
heart
most
wise
thou
also
shalt
find
peace
as
allah
wills
through
following
bravely
what
to
thee
seems
best
when
any
question
is
peace
reply
shelter
of
the
gate
of
paradise
the
shadow
of
the
archway
not
the
arch
within
whose
shade
at
need
the
poor
may
rest
the
weary
be
refreshed
the
weak
secure
and
all
men
pause
to
gladden
as
they
go
and
akbar
pondered
salim
chisti
words
then
turning
to
his
ministers
he
said
here
will
i
build
my
capital
and
here
the
world
shall
come
unto
a
council
hall
and
in
a
place
of
peace
pursue
the
quest
of
wisdom
and
the
finding
out
of
truth
that
there
be
no
more
discord
upon
earth
but
only
knowledge
beauty
and
good
will
and
it
was
done
according
to
akbar
word
there
in
the
wilderness
as
by
magic
rose
futtehpur
sikri
the
victorious
city
of
marble
and
red
sandstone
among
the
trees
a
rose
unfolding
in
the
kindling
dawn
palace
and
mosque
and
garden
and
serai
bazaars
and
baths
and
spacious
pleasure
grounds
by
favor
of
allah
to
perfection
sprang
thus
akbar
wrought
to
make
his
dream
come
true
from
the
four
corners
of
the
world
he
brought
his
master
workmen
from
iran
and
ind
from
wild
mongolia
and
the
arabian
wastes
masons
from
bagdad
delhi
and
multan
dome
builders
from
the
north
from
samarkand
cunning
mosaic
workers
from
kanauj
and
carvers
of
inscriptions
from
shiraz
and
they
all
labored
with
endearing
skill
each
at
his
handicraft
to
make
beauty
be
when
the
first
on
the
timber
rang
the
timid
doves
as
if
foreboding
ill
had
fled
from
sikri
and
its
quiet
groves
but
as
he
promised
akbar
sent
and
bade
the
wise
men
of
all
nations
to
his
court
brahman
and
christian
buddhist
and
parsee
jain
and
stiff
mohammedan
and
jew
all
followers
of
the
one
with
many
names
bringing
the
ghostly
wisdom
of
the
earth
and
so
they
came
of
every
hue
and
creed
from
the
twelve
winds
of
heaven
their
caravans
drew
into
sikri
as
akbar
summoned
them
to
spend
long
afternoons
in
council
grave
sifting
tradition
for
the
seed
of
truth
in
the
great
mosque
in
futtehpur
at
peace
and
salim
chisti
lived
his
holy
life
beloved
and
honored
there
as
akbar
friend
but
light
and
changeable
are
the
hearts
of
men
soon
in
that
city
dedicate
to
peace
dissensions
spread
and
rivalries
grew
rife
envy
and
bitterness
and
strife
returned
once
more
and
truth
before
them
fled
away
then
salim
chisti
coming
to
akbar
spoke
lord
give
thy
servant
leave
now
to
depart
and
follow
where
the
fluttered
wings
have
gone
for
here
there
is
no
longer
any
peace
and
truth
can
not
prevail
where
discord
dwells
nay
then
said
akbar
is
not
thou
but
i
who
am
the
servant
here
and
must
go
hence
i
found
thee
master
of
this
solitude
lord
of
the
princedom
of
a
quiet
mind
a
sovereign
vested
in
tranquillity
and
i
have
done
thee
wrong
and
stayed
thy
feet
from
following
perfection
with
my
horde
of
turbulent
malcontents
and
my
loved
dream
to
build
a
city
of
abiding
peace
was
but
a
vain
illusion
therefore
now
this
foolish
people
shall
be
driven
forth
from
this
fair
place
to
live
as
they
may
choose
in
disputance
and
wrangling
longer
still
until
they
learn
if
allah
wills
it
so
to
lay
aside
their
folly
for
the
truth
and
as
the
king
commanded
so
it
was
more
quickly
than
he
came
with
all
his
court
and
hosts
of
followers
he
went
away
leaving
the
place
to
solitude
once
more
a
rose
to
wither
where
it
once
had
blown
the
unpolluted
sun
shines
through
the
marble
with
no
sound
the
winds
play
hide
and
seek
through
corridors
where
stately
women
with
dark
glowing
eyes
have
laughed
and
frolicked
in
their
fluttering
robes
the
rose
leaves
drop
with
none
to
gather
them
in
gardens
where
no
footfall
comes
with
eve
nor
any
lovers
watch
the
rising
moon
and
ancient
silence
truer
than
all
speech
still
holds
the
secrets
of
the
council
hall
upon
whose
walls
frescoes
of
many
faiths
attest
the
courtesy
of
open
minds
before
the
last
was
gone
the
doves
returned
and
took
up
their
abode
in
the
main
gate
of
those
deserted
walls
and
in
their
custody
this
gate
of
peace
bears
still
the
grandeur
of
its
origin
firing
anew
the
wistful
hearts
of
men
to
brave
endeavor
with
replenished
hope
though
since
that
time
three
hundred
years
ago
the
magic
hush
of
those
forsaken
streets
and
empty
courtyards
has
been
undisturbed
save
by
the
gentle
whirring
of
grey
wings
with
cooing
murmurs
uttered
all
day
long
and
reverent
tread
of
those
from
near
and
far
who
still
pursue
the
immemorial
quest
rutter
and
when
all
my
writing
has
been
done
except
the
final
colophon
and
i
must
bid
beloved
verse
farewell
for
better
or
for
worse
let
me
not
linger
the
page
in
doubting
and
regretful
age
but
as
an
unknown
scribe
in
some
monastic
dim
scriptorium
when
twilight
on
his
labour
fell
at
the
refection
bell
might
add
poor
body
thanks
to
be

toils
set
free
