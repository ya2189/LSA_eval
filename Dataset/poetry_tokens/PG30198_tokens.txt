days
i
if
i
were
in

today
in
little
japan
today
i
watch
the
ride
on
yokohama
bay
i
watch
the
little
pass
on
the
bund
where
play
of
foreign
music
fills
their
ears
with
wonder
new
alway
or
in
a
kuruma
i
step
and
cry
and
bare
brown
feet
should
wheel
me
fast
where
high
above
the
city
and
sea
vast
uprises
with
the
sigh
of
pines
about
its
festal
fanes
built
free
to
sun
and
sky
and
there
till
dusk
i
sit
and
think
of
shaka
muni
lord
of
buddhas
or
of
fudo
fire
and
rope
and
lifted
sword
and
ere
i
left
a
surging
shade
of

a
distant
horde
should
break
and
fugi
cone
stand
clear
with
sutras
overscored
sutras
of
ice
and

written
by

meant
for
the
final

of
the
lord
buddha
and
his
bliss
if
ever
he
repeat
this
life
where
millions
still
are
bound
within
illusion
cheat
ii
or
were
i
in
japan
today
perchance
at
kyoto
down
i
would
search
for
charm
or
curio
up
narrow
stairs
in
sandals
pure
of
soil
or
dust
i
go
into
a
room
of
magic
shapes
gods
dragons
dread
nio
and
seated
on
the
silent
mats
with
many
a
treasure
near
of
ivory
the
gods
have
dreamt
and
satsuma
as
dear
of
bronzes
whose
mysterious
mint
seems
not
of
now
or
here
i
buy
and
dream
and
dream
and
buy
lost
far
in
mâyâ
sphere
then
gathering
up
my
gains
at
last
mid
sayonaras
soft
and
bows
and
gentle
courtesies
repeated
oft
and
oft
my
host
and
i
should
part
o
please
the
skies
much
weal
to
waft
his
years
i
think
then
cross
to
fair
aloft
for
set
aloft
and
set
apart
beyond
the
city
din
under
the
shade
of
ancient
heights
lies
templed
calm
and
there
the
great
bell
booming
fills
its
gates
all
day
and
thin
low
beating
on
mokugyo
by
priests
passioning
for
sin
and
there
the
sun
upon
its
courts
and
carvings
gods
and
graves
rests
as
no
light
of
known
like
to
nirvana
laves
and
washes
with
sweet
into
the
soul
far
caves
and
no
more
shall
this
life
seem
real
to
one
who
feels
its
waves
no
more
i
say
then
wander
on
to
which
is
so
old
far
self
can
not
divine
its
birth
but
knows
that
kwannon
she
of
mercy
might
benign
has
reached
her
thousand
hands
always
from
it
to
nippon
line
and
she
should
hear
my
many
prayers
and
have
my
freest
gifts
and
many
days
beside
her
should
i
watch
the
crystal
rifts
of
otawa
clear
waters
earn
their
way
rocks
and
drifts
beside
the
trestled
temple
down
like
murmurs
of
sweet
shrifts
then
when
the
city
wearied
me
to
katsura
i
wend
a
garden
hid
across
green
miles
of
quaintly
penned
and
by
the
lake
i
walk
or
musing
mend
my
soul
with
and
hopes
without
an
end
iii
or
were
i
in
japan
today
hiroshima
should
call
my
heart
hiroshima
built
round
her
ancient
castle
wall
by
the
low
flowering
moat
where
sun
and
silence
ever
fall
into
a
swoon
i
build
again
old
days
of
daimyo
thrall
of
charge
and
bloody
countercharge
when
many
a
samurai
fell
at
its
pale
suppressing
groan
or
cry
suppressing
all
but
silent
hates
that
swept
from
eye
to
eye
while
lips
smiled
decorously
on
or
mocked
urbane
goodbye
then
to
the
river
i
would
pass
and
drift
upon
its
tide
by
many
a
hung
in
bloom
above
its
mirrored
side
and
geisha
fluttering
gay
before
their
guests
should
pause
in
pied
kimono
then
with
laughter
bright
behind
the
shoji
hide
unto
an
isle
of
low
port
my
craft
should
swing
or
scarce
an
island
seems
it
now
to
my
fair
fancying
but
a
shrined
jut
of
earth
up
thro
the
sea
from
which
to
sing
unto
the
evening
star
of
all
night
incarnations
bring
then
backward
thro
the
darkened
streets
i
walk
long
lanterns
writ
with
ghostly
characters
should
dance
beside
each
door
or
flit
thin
paper
spirits
to
and
fro
and
mow
the
wind
when
it
demanded
of
them
reverence
and
passed
with
twirl
or
twit
what
music
too
of
samisen
and
koto
i
should
hear
tinkle
on
weirder
tinkle
thro
the
strangely
wistful
ear
what
shadows
on
the
of
my
dim
soul
should
veer
all
night
in
sleep
and
haunt
the
light
of
many
a
coming
year
iv
or
were
i
in
japan
today
from
ujina
i
sail
for
migajima
upon
the
distance
frail
as
the
mirage
to
amida
of
this
world
transient
tale
where
he
sits
clothed
in
boundless
light
and
sees
it
vainly
ail
up
to
the
great
its
i
wind
there
furl
my
sail
beneath
its
beam
and
soon
my
soul
should
find
what
it
shall
never
tho
it
sift
the
world
elsewhere
and
blind
itself
at
last
with
sight
of
all
earth
blisses
to
mankind
migajima
migajima
how
would
enchantment
chant
the
syllables
within
me
till
desire
should
cease
and
pant
of
passion
press
no
more
my
will
but
let
charmed
peace
supplant
all
thought
of
birth
and
death
and
birth
yea
karma
turn
askant
for
on
migajima
none
may
give
birth
and
none
may
die
since
birth
and
death
are
equal
sins
unto
the
wise
so
i
should
muse
all
day
where
the
sea
spills
its
murmur
softly
by
the
still
stone
lanterns
all
arow
under
the
deathless
sky
and
under
and
and
pine
and
tall
pagoda
rising
roof
on
roof
into
the
shine
of
the
pure
air
red
roof
on
roof
with
memories
in
each
line
of
far
confucian
china
where
they
first
were
held
divine
and
migajima
the
moon
should
rise
for
me
again
so
magical
its
glow
i
dare
think
of
it
only
when
my
heart
is
strong
to
shun
the
snare
of
witcheries
that
men
may
lose
their
souls
in
evermore
nor
after
care
nor
ken
v
yes
were
i
in
japan
today
these
things
i
do
and
more
for
ise
gleams
in
royal
groves
and
nara
with
its
lore
and
nikko
hid
in
mountains
where
the
shogun
great
of
yore
built
timeless
tombs
whose
glory
glooms
funereally
these
things
i
do
but
last
of
all
on
kamakura
lea
i
seek
daibutsu
face
of
calm
and
still
the
final
sea
of
all
the
west
within
me
from
its
fret
and
fever
free
my
spirit
into
patience
peace
and
passion
mastery
the
young
to
the
old
you
who
are
old
and
have
fought
the
fight
and
have
won
or
lost
or
left
the
field
weigh
us
not
down
with
fears
of
the
world
as
we
run
with
the
wisdom
that
is
too
right
the
warning
to
which
we
can
not
yield
the
shadow
that
follows
the
sun
follows
forever
and
with
all
that
desire
must
leave
undone
though
as
a
god
it
endeavor
weigh
weigh
us
not
down
but
gird
our
hope
to
believe
that
all
that
is
done
is
done
by
dream
and
daring
bid
us
dream
on
that
earth
was
not
born
or
heaven
built
of
bewaring
yield
us
the
dawn
you
dreamt
your
hour
and
dared
but
we
would
dream
till
all
you
despaired
of
would
dare
till
the
world
won
to
a
new
wayfaring
be
thence
forever
easier
upward
drawn
off
the
irish
coast
gulls
on
the
wind
crying
crying
are
you
the
ghosts
of
erin
dead
of
the
forlorn
whose
days
went
sighing
ever
for
beauty
that
ever
fled
ever
for
light
that
never
kindled
ever
for
song
no
lips
have
sung
ever
for
joy
that
ever
dwindled
ever
for
love
that
stung
a
vision
of
venus
and
adonis
i
know
not
where
it
was
i
saw
them
sit
for
in
my
dreams
i
had
outwandered
far
that
endless
wanderer
men
call
the
sea
whose
winds
like
incantations
wrap
the
world
and
help
the
moon
in
her
high
mysteries
i
know
not
how
it
was
that
i
was
led
unto
their
tryst
or
what
dim
infinite
of
perfect
and
imperishable
night
hung
round
a
radiance
ineffable
for
i
was
too
intoxicate
and
tranced
with
beauty
that
i
knew
was
very
love
so
when
divinity
from
her
had
stolen
into
his
spirit
as
from
fields
of
myrrh
or
forests
of
red
sandal
by
the
sea
steal
slaking
airs
and
he
began
to
speak
i
could
but
gather
these
few
fleeting
words
your
glance
sends
fragrance
sweeter
than
the
lily
your
hands
are
visible
bodiments
of
song
you
are
the
voice
that
april
light
has
lost
her
silence
that
was
music
of
glad
birds
the
wind
heart
have
you
and
its
mystery
when
poet
spring
comes
piping
the
hills
to
make
of
tartarus
forgotten
fear
yea
all
the
generations
of
the
world
whose
whence
and
whither
but
the
gods
shall
know
are
vassal
to
your
vows
forevermore
and
she
i
knew
made
answer
for
her
words
fell
warm
as
womanhood
with
wordless
things
but
i
had
drifted
on
within
my
dream
to
that
pale
space
which
is
oblivion
somnambulism
i
night
is
above
me
and
night
is
above
the
night
the
sea
is
beside
me
soughing
or
is
still
the
earth
as
a
somnambulist
moves
on
in
a
strange
sleep
a
cries
and
the
cry
wakes
in
me
dim
dead
my
sires
who
more
than
myself
are
me
who
sat
on
their
beach
long
nights
ago
and
saw
the
sea
in
its
silence
and
cursed
it
or
implored
or
with
the
cross
defied
then
on
the
morrow
in
their
boats
went
down
ii
night
is
above
me
and
night
is
above
the
night
rocks
are
about
me
and
beyond
the
sand
and
the
low
reluctant
tide
that
rushes
back
to
ebb
a
last
farewell
to
the
flotsam
borne
so
long
upon
its
breast
rocks
but
the
tide
is
out
and
the
slime
lies
naked
like
a
thing
ashamed
that
has
no
and
the
hushes
the
bird
and
all
far
cries
within
my
blood
and
earth
as
a
somnambulist
moves
on
serenata
magica
my
gondola
is
a
black
and
glides
beneath
the
moon
dark
palaces
beside
me
pass
like
visions
in
a
of
what
shall
never
be
alas
or
what
has
been
too
soon
like
what
shall
never
be
but
in
the
breathing
of
a
swoon
my
gondola
is
a
black
and
makes
her
mystic
way
from
door
to
phantom
while
carven
balconies
hang
and
casements
framed
for
love
say
more
than
love
can
ever
say
say
more
than
any
voice
but
voice
of
silent
magic
may
my
gondola
is
a
black
rialto
lies
behind
and
by
me
the
salute
swings
a
loveliness
that
must
take
wings
and
vanish
as
imaginings
within
an
afrit
mind
as
vague
and
vast
imaginings
that
can
no
substance
find
my
gondola
is
a
black
san
marco
and
the
shaft
of
the
slim
campanile
steal
into
my
trance
and
leave
a
seal
upon
my
senses
like
the
feel
of
long
enchantment
quaffed
of
long
enchantments
such
as
songs
of
sage
al
raschid
waft
my
gondola
is
a
black
and
gains
to
the
lagoon
where
samphire
and
around
me
float
or
softly
stir
while
venice
still
lifts
her
fair
witchery
to
the
moon
and
all
that
wonder
gave
birth
seems
out
of
beauty
hewn
and
moto
i
all
my
heart
today
is
dreaming
of
your
fate
and
of
your
little
house
that
stood
beside
the
temple
gate
of
its
hid
away
behind
white
paper
doors
and
of
the
young
who
read
too
late
with
you
ii
dwelt
in
yedo
where
a
thousand
wonders
dwell
gods
golden
palaces
and
shrines
that
like
a
charm
enspell
dwelt
among
them
there
more
wondrous
she
than
all
a
flower
some
forgetful
god
had
from
his
hand
let
fall
iii
and
all
her
days
were
as
the
dream
on
flowers
in
the
sun
and
all
her
ways
were
as
the
waves
that
by
run
and
in
her
gaze
there
was
the
gleam
of
stars
that
can
not
wait
too
long
for
love
and
so
fare
forth
from
heaven
to
find
a
mate
iv
dwelt
so
till
one
night
when
all
the
city
slept
when
not
a
paper
lantern
swung
when
only
swept
soft
cipherings
of
across
the
temple
gloom
sudden
a
cry
was
heard
the
cry
that
should
doom
v
for
following
the
cry
came
flame
a
chaya
roof
and
quickly
was
the
street
a
stream
of
stricken
folk
whose
gaze
knew
well
that
when
the
morning
came
their
homes
would
be
but
smoke
vanished
upon
the
winds
now
had
fate
awoke
vi
and
waited
for
at
morning
priests
in
pity
of
her
years
and
desolation
led
her
back
behind
the
great
god
spheres
the
great
god
buddha
who
of
beasts
and
men
all
mindful
was
o
buddha
in
thy
very
courts
learned
love
laws
vii
love
of
the
body
and
the
soul
not
of
nirvana
state
love
that
beyond
itself
can
see
no
beauty
wise
or
great
for
a
moon
a
whole
moon
happy
there
beheld
the
young
whose
yearning
into
his
eyes
upwelled
viii
so
all
too
soon
for
her
was
found
elsewhere
a
kindly
thatch
and
all
too
soon
heard
behind
her
close
love
latch
they
led
her
from
the
temple
ground
into
untrysting
days
and
all
too
soon
that
happy
moon
was
hid
in
sorrow
haze
ix
for
now
at
dawn
she
rose
to
dress
with
blooms
some
honored
vase
or
to
embroider
or
brew
sweet
ceremonial
grace
or
she
at
dusk
in
sick
distress
before
the
butsudan
must
to
ancestral
tablets
pray
not
to
her
x
not
unto
him
her
love
who
sways
her
breast
as
moon
the
tide
whose
breath
is
incense
ah
again
to
see
him
softly
glide
before
the
grave
gaze
of
inward
ecstasy
to
watch
the
great
bell
boom
for
him
its
mystic
xi
but
weeks
grew
into
weariness
and
weariness
to
pain
and
pain
to
lonely
wildness
which
set
fire
unto
her
brain
and
i
will
see
my
love
distress
made
fair
cry
tho
for
ten
lives
away
from
him
i
then
must
live
and
die
xii
yet
no
she
dared
not
go
to
him
to
her
he
could
not
come
then
sudden
a
thought
her
being
swept
and
struck
her
loud
heart
dumb
till
in
her
rose
confusion
dim
fear
fighting
with
desire
which
to
took
the
shape
of
fudo
god
of
fire
xiii
and
fudo
won
her
for
that
night
did
fond
dare
to
set
aflame
her
father
house
hoping
again
to
share
the
temple
with
her
acolyte
her
who
spent
with
speechless
passion
for
her
face
in
vain
strove
to
repent
xiv
but
ah
what
destiny
can
do
is
not
for
folly
hand
the
flames
kindled
were
from
sea
to
shiba
fanned
and
it
was
learned
a
girl
had
charred
a
thousand
homes
then
were
the
folk
like
to
a
sea
that
foams
xv
and
so
they
seized
her
but
not
in
the
temple
o
not
there
had
she
been
led
again
by
priests
in
pity
led
to
share
her
lover
eyes
no
but
her
sin
brought
not
one
dear
delight
to
poor
who
was
now
to
look
on
her
last
rite
xvi
for
to
the
stake
they
bound
her
fire
they
lit
to
be
her
fate
have
i
dreamt
it
all
your
face
the
temple
gate
the
fair
shut
from
desire
in
buddhahood
then
let
me
dream
and
ever
dream
o
flower
by
yedo
sea
as
of
old
the
fishermen
bade
their
wives
farewell
the
sun
floated
merry
up
the
morning
they
sang
to
the
rhythm
of
the
swell
o
come
lads
scorning
the
highlands
high
there
no
warning
in
the
blue
south
sky
there
no
warning
o
come
lads
free
we
cross
the
harbor
bar
and
put
to
sea
the
fisherwives
prayed
the
sails
blew
fast
o
home
it
is
happy
where
there
hoping
they
prayed
till
the
mist
dimmed
each
dim
mast
then
we
not
moping
they
sweetly
sang
winds
come
groping
and
clouds
but
we
not
moping
tho
left
ashore
they
come
to
us
at
dusk
when
day
is
but
swifter
than
god
the
came
the
fishers
they
were
swallowed
in
its
swirling
o
swifter
than
men
could
name
god
name
and
white
waves
curling
hissed
in
to
shore
the
whirling
saw
what
dashed
hoar
the
whirling
saw
dead
upborne
the
fishers
that
went
forth
upon
the
morn
a
prayer
one
cricket
left
of
summer
choir
one
flashing

one

with
leathern

one

one

a

seeking

one
prayer
within
my
heart
for
all
who
part
upon
death
dark
portal
with
no
hope
of
an
immortal
morrow
for

quest
the
song
of
a

worshiper

on
the

without
all

a
voice
that
broke
in
my
brain
and
blew
blind
thoughts
about
all
night
they
whirled
as
a
haunted
throng
from
some
dim
world
where
there
is
no
rest
all
night
the
rain
and
the
wind
that
swirled
and
the
infinite
lone

lad

lass
i
heard
the
buds
open
their
lips
and
whisper
whisper
spring
is
here
the
robins
listened
and
sang
it
loud
the
came
in
a
fluttering
crowd
the
cardinal
preached
it
high
and
proud
spring
and
thro
the
warm
earth
their
song
went
trilling
trilling
wake
arise
the
kingcups
quickly
assembled
strong
the
bluets
stept
from
the
moss
in
throng
like
fairies
too
came
the
cress
along
spring
and
love
in
your
breast
my
lass
awaking
waking
was
born
your
eyes
were
kindled
your
lips
were
warm
wild
beauties
broke
from
your
face
and
form
and
all
my
heart
was
a
was
spring
the
strong
man
to
his
sires
tonight
as
i
was
riding
on
a
wave
of
triumph
and
of
glory
a
question
suddenly
as
from
the
grave
rose
in
me
culpatory
whence
come
to
you
this
joyance
and
this
strength
it
said
this
might
of
vision
this
will
that
measures
all
things
to
its
length
that
cuts
with
calm
decision
this
blood
within
your
veins
that
is
as
wine
which
destiny
self
blesses
whence
flows
it
from
what
grape
that
is
divine
or
trodden
from
what
presses
do
you
so
proud
forget
what
hands
have
borne
you
to
the
heights
and
crowned
you
would
you
behold
what
sackcloth
has
been
worn
that
laurels
may
surround
you
i
would
o
lips
invisible
whose
breath
i
answered
so
arraigns
me
whose
voice
is
as
a
sound
sent
forth
of
death
and
like
to
death
entrains
me
i
would
for
if
the
flesh
of
me
and
soul
are
fibred
with
the
ages
my
triumph
is
of
them
and
manifold
of
all
life
mystic
stages
so
forth
they
came
a
vast
ancestral
line
upon
my
vision
teeming
all
shapes
whose
natal
semblance
could
affine
them
to
me
faintly
gleaming
i
knew
them
as
i
knew
myself
and
felt
the
day
of
each
within
me
and
so
began
to
speak
the
while
they
dwelt
about
they
who
had
been
me
my
sires
i
said
think
you
i
have
forgot
the
fervor
of
your
living
how
into
me
is
moulded
all
you
thought
of
getting
or
of
giving
think
you
i
do
not
feel
my
every
drop
of
blood
is
as
an
ocean
in
which
are
surging
and
will
never
stop
all
things
your
hope
gave
motion
my
senses
that
are
swift
to
take
delight
and
shrine
it
in
their
being
are
they
not
born
of
all
your
faith
and
bright
with
all
your
bliss
of
seeing
and
my
full
heart
within
whose
fount
i
hear
your
voices
that
are
vanished
can
it
forget
its
gratitude
or
fear
foes
that
you
braved
and
banished
no
but
the
blindly
striving
years
that
led
you
to
the
rose
beauty
or
taught
you
out
of
ill
to
disembed
the
golden
veins
of
duty
the
wasting
and
incalculable
wants
that
in
you
quailed
or
quivered
the
longing
that
lit
stars
no
dark
now
daunts
know
who
stand
delivered
to
you
then
from
whose
throng
the
centuries
long
dead
slip
now
their
shrouding
who
from
oblivion
profundities
rise
up
and
round
are
crowding
i
say
immortal
do
i
hold
your
will
its
gathered
might
ascending
is
sacred
with
the
unconquerable
might
of
god
who
sees
its
ending

on
whose
strong
vine
heredity
rooted
in
voids
primeval
the
world
climbs
ever
to
some
great
of
passion

reprieval
i
said
and
on
night
infinite
beheld
silence
alone
beside
me
and
majesty
of
greater
meanings
welled
into
my
soul
to
guide
me
at
stratford

could
not

the
wind
poured
in
my
ear
immortal
names

hal
macbeth
and
thro
the
night
i
heard
the
rushing
breath
of
ghost
and
witch
and
fool
go
whirling
by
i
followed
them
under
the
phantom
sphere
of
the
pale
moon
along
the

nimbused
flowing

to

as
i

upon

dust
i
could
have
asked
god
for
his
starry
lyre
out
of

could
have
shouted

kneel
and
pass
on
the
image
painter
up
under
the
roof
in
cold
or
heat
far
up
aloof
from
the
city
street
she
sat
all
day
and
painted
gray
cold
idols
scarcely
human
and
if
she
thought
of
ease
and
rest
of
love
that
spells
god
name
the
best
her
few
friends
heard
but
one
request
pray
for
a
tired
little
woman
she
sat
from
dawn
till
weary
dusk
her
hands
plied
on
with
but
a
husk
of
bread
to
break
and
for
christ
sake
to
bless
was
not
human
then
when
the
light
would
leave
her
brush
she
sit
there
still
in
the
dim
hush
and
say
aloud
lest
tears
should
rush
pray
for
a
tired
little
woman
they
found
her
so
one
morning
when
a
knock
brought
no
sweet
welcome
ken
of
her
still
face
and
cloistral
grace
and
brow
so
bravely
human
they
found
her
by
the
window
bar
her
eyes
fixed
where
had
been
some
star
o
you
that
rest
you
are
pray
for
the
tired
little
woman
wanda
she
shall
be
sportive
as
the
fawn
that
wild
with
glee
across
the
lawn
or
up
the
mountain
springs
i
wanda
born
of
the
mirthful
morn
so
i
heard
the
whisper
to
the
forest
beech
tho
i
know
that
each
is
but
a
gossipy
lisper
i
taunt
the
brook
with
his
hair
outshook
the
weir
so
cool
and
mossy
and
mock
the
crow
as
he
peers
below
with
a
caw
that
vain
and
saucy
where
the
wahoo
reds
and
the
sumac
spreads
tall
plumes
the
purple
privet
i
beg
a
kiss
of
the
wind
tho
i
wis
right
well
he
never
will
give
it
i
hide
in
the
nook
and
sunbeams
look
for
me
everywhere
like
fairies
then
out
i
glide
by
the
gray
deer
side
ha
ha
but
he
never
tarries
then
i
fright
the
hare
from
his
turfy
lair
and
after
him
send
a
volley
of
song
that
stops
him
under
the
copse
in
wonderment
at
my
folly
and
autumn
cries
be
sad
or
sighs
thro
her
nun
lips
palely
pouting
but
then
i
leap
to
the
woods
and
keep
it
wild
with
gleeing
and
shouting
and
when
the
sun
has
almost
spun
a
path
to
his
far
golconda
i
climb
the
hill
and
listen
still
while
he
calls
me
wanda
wanda
and
then
i
go
to
the
valley
oh
my
dreams
are
sweeter
than
dreaming
all
night
i
play
over
lands
of
fay
in
delight
that
seems
not
seeming
in
a
storm
a
all
day
long
in
the
spindrift
swinging
bird
of
the
sea
bird
of
the
sea
how
i
would
that
i
had
thy
winging
how
i
envy
thee
how
i
would
that
i
had
thy
spirit
so
to
careen
joyous
to
cry
over
the
storm
and
never
fear
it
into
the
night
that
hovers
near
it
calm
on
a
reeling
sky
all
day
long
and
the
night
unresting
ah
i
believe
thy
every
breath
means
that
life
best
comes
ever
breasting
peril
and
pain
and
death
antagonists
i
life
flung
to
art
this
voice
of

bare
fool
to
my
human
earth

you
so
free
to
wreathe
with
phantom
immortality
whoever
climbs
with
passionate
lone
care
that
shifting
feverous
and
shadow
stair
to
beauty
which
is
vainer
than
the

on
furious
thirst

down

my
blood
to
pity
that

the
verdancy

lost
upon
the

of
hopes
misborn

fading
not

how
shall
i
burn
not
with
all
loves
that
alway
billow
thro
me
their
slow
fire
fed
by
the
agony
of
hearts
how
loose
me
from
too
long
commisery
for
those
whom
unrequiting
time
has
given
to
the
altar
of
the
aching
world
unrest
a
grief
immitigable
to
the
hand
whose
mystery
of
returning
sun
can
heal
winter
away
seems
here
a
grief
but
calm
of
immortality
can
make
forgiven
for
even
as
all
the
gleaming
girth
of
stars
that
wreathe
the
illimitable
beauteously
quench
not
the
vast
of
night
so
do
all
joys
life
strews
along
her
passing
to
the
grave
prevail
not
the
shadow
of
sure
death
and
o
humanity
harp
of
unnumbered
shall
his
skill
flung
thus
forever
thy
fragile
rest
build
but
these
harmonies
that
seem
sometimes
unworth
the
misery
of
the
trampled
worm
would
would
i
were
not
vibrant
with
all
strains
he
strikes
from
thee
or
else
more
perfect
tuned
have
i
known
like
unto
god
the
soul
return
let
me
lie
here
i
care
not
for
the
distant
hills
today
and
the
blue
sphere
of
far
infinity
that
draws
away
all
to
its
deep
would
only
sweep
soothing
the
farther
from
me
with
its
sway
let
me
lie
here
gazing
with
vacant
sadness
on
this
weed
the
cricket
near
will
utter
all
my
heart
can
bear
to
heed
another
voice
would
swell
the
noise
and
surge
that
ever
sound
in
human
need
let
me
lie
here
for
now
so
long
my
wasted
soul
has
tossed
on
the
wide
mere
of
mystery
hope
wing
alone
has
crossed
i
ask
no
more
than
to
restore
to
simple
things
the
wonder
they
have
lost
birthright
my
own
among
the
unnumbered
years
god
casts
from
that
full
garner
which
is
his
eternity
one
shall
be
ours
beyond
all
fate
or
fears
for
ranging
lone
amid
its
thorns
seeking
the
buds
that
grew
between
we
met
and
made
its
morning
seem
new
in
a
world
grown
old
to
morns
and
so
tho
he
may
scatter
still
many
a
fadeless
other
round
in
none
for
us
shall
there
be
found
that
first
awakening
and
thrill
but
as
in
peace
we
tread
love
land
to
which
it
gave
us
right
of
birth
we
shall
remember
that
new
earth
came
when
we
first
walked
hand
in
hand
romance
on
north
cliff
lynton
hurry
to
meet
the
shore
an
hundred
fathoms
down
gray
sails
are
shimmering
on
the
wind
far
out
from
lynmouth
town
high
crags
above
us
are
whispering
keen
the
heather
and
the
ling
laugh
to
the
sky
as
driven
by
the
wild
gulls
cry
or
cling
and
where
the
far
sun
like
a
god
scatters
the
mist
lies
shore
is
it
romance
magic
realm
spring
reigns
forever
romance
that
our
morning
hearts
could
see
across
the
darkest
foam
then
do
we
know
it
well
my
love
because
it
is
our
home
on
the
atlantic
who
stood
upon
that
schooner
driven
deck
last
night
as
reefed
and
shuddering
she
hove
into
the
twilight
and
all
desperate
drove
from
wave
to
angrier
wave
that
sought
her
wreck
who
labored
at
her
helm
and
watched
the
wind
stagger
the
sea
with
all
his
stunning
might
until
in
dimness
dwindling
from
our
sight
she
vanished
in
the
wrack
that
rode
behind
we
know
not
you
and
i
but
our
two
souls
that
followed
as
the
waves
felt
all
the
might
of
him
who
sinks
or
saves
and
all
the
pity
of
earth
unreached
goals
felt
all
then
swift
returning
to
our
love
dwelt
in
its
peace
uplifted
safe
above
by
a
silent
stream
to
sit
by
a
silent
stream
watching
dream
while
breezes
winnow
the
floating
seeds
and
the
aery
minnow
weaves
his
wavy
web
among
the
reeds
where
a
fallen
sycamore
whitely
arches
a
pathway
and
shadows
darkle
the
lambent
cool
as
softly
sunbeams
arrow
lightnings
thro
the
pool
where
the
everlasting
breath
odors
mysteries
of
death
where
rusted
leaf
and
pod
by
insects
dusted
rustle
then
in
autumn
sadness
nod
to
sit
till
every
sense
lose
thought
of
whither
and
whence
till
earth
and
heaven
and
faith
and
fate
no
longer
leaven
life
with
hope
or
fear
or
love
or
hate
the
great
buddha
of
kamakura
to
the
sphinx
grave
brother
of
the
burning
sands
whose
eyes
enshrine
forever
the
desert
soul
are
you
not
worn
of
gazing
outward
to
dim
strands
of
stars
that
weary
never
infinity
no
answer
has
for
time
untold
distresses
its
deepest
maze
of
mystery
is
but
illusion
built
up
as
the
blind
build
skies
with
guesses
nor
has
eternity
a
place
on
any
starry
summit
the
winds
of
death
are
wide
as
life
and
leave
no
world
untouched
but
race
and
soon
with
night
benumb
it
and
karma
is
the
law
of
soul
and
star
yea
of
all
being
and
from
it
but
one
way
there
is
retreat
into
that
trancèd
whole
which
is
not
sight
nor
seeing
which
is
not
mind
nor
mindlessness
nor
deed
nor
driven
doer
nor
want
nor
wasting
of
desire
but
only
that
which
won
can
bless
and
of
all
else
is
pure
turn
then
your
eyes
from
the
far
track
of
worlds
and
gazing
inward
o
brother
fare
where
life
has
come
yea
into
its
far
whence
fare
back
all
other
ways
are
sinward
necromance
can
heedless
gazing
teach
me
more
than
toil
can
swaying
of
sere
sedge
along
the
slope
or
the
dull
lisp
of
oaken
limbs
that
foil
the
sun
ensheathing
fervor
interfuse
my
vacant
being
with
far
meanings
whose
soft
airs
blow
from
the
hidden
seas
of
hope
or
can
the
wintry
sumac
sably
stooping
so
charm
and
lift
my
heart
from
heartless
drooping
when
other
healings
all
were
asked
in
vain
yes
there
are
witcheries
in
the
things
of
earth
that
breathe
with
an
illimitable
voice
wisdom
and
calm
to
us
and
lure
to
birth
dim
intimations
bidding
us
rejoice
even
in
the
great
mystery
of
pain
look
not
to
the
west
look
not
to
the
west
where
the
sun
is
dying
on
fields
of
darkening
clouds
look
not
to
the
west
where
the
wild
birds
nest
and
the
winds
are
hieing
to
sweep
away
sleep
from
the
forest
and
tatter
the
shrouds
of
sable
silence
lit
by
the
look
not

the
west
is
best
for
the
heart
to
hear
not
the
chants
of
evening
over
day
death
look
not
to
the

where
the
sun
is
dying
the
sun
that
rose
with
song
look
not
to
the
west
where
the
closèd
quest
of
thy
soul
seems
lying
where
every
sorrow
that
ever
was
wed
with
wrong
in
human
breast
from
the
sea
of
its
radiance
never
fades
look
not
to
the

is
best
for
the
heart
to
see
not
the
shades
that
rise
the
wrecks
of
the
past
a
nikko
shrine
under
the
sway
in
old
japan
of
silent
cryptic
trees
there
is
a
shrine
the
worldliest
would
near
with
bended
knees
green
thro
a
torii
the
way
leads
to
it
worn
across
a
rivulet
whose
voice
intones
with
mystery
of
moss
a
mystery
that
is
everywhere
the

beneath
his
shrine
seems
but
a
mossy
shape

so
ensheathed
is
more
divine
for
tho
nature
has
muffled
him
and
sealed
him
there
away
the
meaning
of
all
faith
remains
that
men
will
ever
pray
aye

as
long
as

has
need
as
long
as
earth
is
sod
with
tombs
bow
down
the

to
all
that
wakens
in
them
god
the
question
i
shall
lie
so
one
day
with
lips
of
silence
set
eyes
that
no
tear
can
wet
again
a
thing
of
clay
i
shall
lie
so
and
earth
will
seize
again
her
dust
though
she
must
gnaw
and
rust
the
coffin
iron
girth
i
shall
lie
so
and
they
who
still
the
day
bestride
will
stand
so
by
my
side
and
with
sad
yearning
say
what
is
he
now
this
man
shut
in
a
pallor
there
his
spirit
that
could
dare
what
what
now
is
its
span
a
withered
atom
space
within
a
withered
brain
or
can
it
from
the
wain
to
far
orion
race
and
like
all
that
have
died
i
shall
but
answer
naught
yet
time
this
truth
has
taught
the
question
will
abide
i
look
no
more
i
look
no
more
thro
timeless
hours
my
eyes
without
intent
have
watched
the
slowing
flight
of
ebon
crows
across
quiescent
skies
till
all
are
gone
the
last
a
lonely
bird
scudding
to
rest
thro
streams
of
golden
curd
that
flow
far
eastward
to
the
coming
night
and
as
i
turn
again
to
foiling
thought
my
spirit
leaves
me
as
faint
zephyrs
leave
the
trees
at
evening
tho
all
day
they
sought
a
place
to
hide
them
in
and
fondly
grieve
and
silently
the
slow
oil
sinks
beneath
the
noiseless
burning
wick
of
yellow
flame
it
is
as
if
god
back
to
him
would
breathe
all
the
world
given
life
and
end
its
aim
night
occultism
northward
the
twilight

lingers

the

sinks
beneath

immovable

shade

sealed
with
mystery

a
memory
of
dead
gold
wakes
on
a
sunset

orbiting
over

litany

strange
avatar
uncrowned
i
am
not
other
than
men
are
you
say
but
faulty
and
failing
and
your
love
can
lend
no
glory
of
illusion
to
the
lack
and
make
me
seem
one
in
whom
blend
nobilities
wherein
your
heart
may
lose
all
that
it
feels
of
flaw
in
me
or
rues
can
it
so
be
did
ever
woman
love
whose
faith
wreathed
not
about
the
brow
she
chose
aureolas
illumining
him
above
all
that
another
thinks
he
is
or
knows
i
ask
it
bravely
for
the
way
is
long
and
haloless
should
i
not
lead
you
wrong
written
in
hell
sir
giles
whom
the
witch
of
urm
leads
to
judas
against
a
castle
moated
gloomily
by
a
bitter
drain
of
blood
from
whose
fetid
wave
contumely
of
all
truth
was
reeking
fumily
and
infectiously
i
stood
waiting
for
her
sign
a
shriek
repeated
nine
i
shrank
at
every
aspish
quivering
fear
set
crawling
in
my
breast
but
betimes
i
felt
a
shivering
shriek
cut
ear
and
brain
with
slivering
stings
of
terror
sin
unrest
christ
it
raised
the
dead
out
of
the
moat
black
bed
nine
times
and
then
across
the
thickening
reek
a
rusty
draw
was
dropped
thro
portcullis
sped
a
quickening
shadow
past
to
where
with
sickening
feet
befixed
by
awe
i
stopped
there
she
laughed
a
laugh
no
devil
soul
could
quaff
i
swear
its
clamor
tore
the
stuttering
leaves
from
shrub
and
shrunken
tree
swear
no
limbo
heard
muttering
like
that
spawn
of
echoes
sputtering
midnight
with
their
drunken
glee
yet
ere
half
were
done
i
could
not
hear
a
one
she
put
her
finger
burning
eerily
to
my
lips
i
heard
them
lock
led
me
then
a
cheerily
tho
the
quick
ooze
spurted
drearily
thro
curd
and
rock
things
like
slid
slimily
in
pools
she
stepped
just
once
upon
a
hideous
burrow
dank
and
haired
with
grass
fixed
upon
me
eyes
perfidious
as
a
fiend
are
yet
insidious
questioned
if
i
dared
to
pass
i
will
search
all
hell
to
find
him
from
me
fell
and
so
was
drawn
thro
dark
cadaverous
with
the
sound
of
gabbling
dead
where
we
heard
them
hoot
palaverous
drivel
learned
beneath
unsavorous
moulds
and
saw
a
glutton
head
grin
to
a
hissing
bat
that
scraped
him
as
he
spat
witch
she
was
i
knew
turned
shepherdess
to
a
soul
blind
as
a
sheep
but
i
dogged
her
on
jeopardous
steeps
down
which
she
sped
with
leopardess
limbs
into
miasmic
deeps
swim
she
gasped
behind
then
like
a
whined
it
almost
seemed
to
me
as
deadening
as
the
sluice
of
dreary
styx
fire
and
foulness
mixed
with
leadening
slush
i
drank
but
swam
the
reddening
stuff
a
league
with
weary
licks
up
a
sulphurous
bank
we
climbed
and
there
i
sank
again
she
laughed
that
laugh
a
shrivelling
ghastly
gaunt
uncanny
spate
up
i
sprang
and
cursed
my
snivelling
soul
for
weariness
for
drivelling
and
for
so
forgetting
hate
you
will
find
him
there
she
pointed
thro
her
hair
i
write
these
words
from
hell
where
bloodily
locked
with
him
in
fight
i
woke
where
we
fall
down
caverns
ruddily
spilt
with
glazing
gore
and
muddily
dashed
with
stagnant
night
and
smoke
yet
i
do
not
care
for
he
groans
by
me
there
at
the
helm
fog
and
a
wind
that
blows
the
sea
blindly
into
my
eyes
and
i
know
not
if
my
soul
shall
be
when
the
day
dies
but
if
it
be
not
and
i
lose
all
that
men
live
to
gain
i
who
have
little
known
but
hues
of
wind
and
rain
still
i
shall
envy
no
man
lot
for
i
have
held
this
great
never
in
whines
to
have
forgot
that
fate
is
fate
dead
love
if
this
should
never
end
this
wandering
in
oblivious
mood
along
a
rutless
road
that
leads
from
wood
to
deeper
wood
this
crunching
with
unheedful
foot
acorns
i
think
and
withered
leaves
perhaps
a
rotten
root
if
this
should
never
end
this
seeing
with
insentient
eyes
something
that
seems
like
earth
and
too
like
overbending
skies
this
feeling
well
that
time
is
space
space
time
and
each
a
pallid
glass
in
which
life
sees
her
face
if
it
should
never
end
the
road
the
wandering
and
the
feel
of
dead
infinities
that
seem
our
dead
sense
to
steal
and
like
seas
cease
above
would
it
much
matter
love
mortal
sin
for
a
much
the
wind
knows
of
my
heart
though
he
whispers
in
my
ear
that
he
has
seen
me
burn
and
start
when
i
dream
of
your
breast
my
dear
much
the
wind
knows
of
my
soul
for
no
soul
has
he
to
lose
on
a
mistress
who
can
dole
kisses
that
drug
as
breton
three
waves
of
the
sea
came
up
on
the
wind
to
me
one
said
away
he
is
dead
upon
my
foam
i
have
flung
his
head
go
back
to
your
cote
you
shall
never
wed
nor
he
three
waves
of
the
sea
came
up
on
the
wind
to
me
two
brake
the
third
with
a
quake
cried
loud
o
maid
i
find
for
thy
sake
his
dead
lost
body
prepare
his
wake
and
back
it
plunged
to
the
sea
three
waves
of
the
sea
came
up
on
the
wind
to
me
one
bore
and
swept
on
the
shore
his
pale
pale
face
i
shall
kiss
no
more
ah
woe
to

death
passes
woe

the
ballad
for
three
kings
with
naught
of
a
care
to
a
hunting
went
three
kings
of
stirrup
fair
and
of
bent
away
they
rode
with
a
song
on
the
summer
tide
away
from
thrid
and
throng
by
the
blue
lake
side
and
ho
they
vaunted
aloud
to
the
morning
hills
and
ha
what
reck
the
proud
for
the
god
of
ills
naught
so
they
swagged
thro
the
glade
where
the
rose
she
nosed
the
wind
affrayed
by
the
blod
ho
hos
three
arrows
now
to
her
heart
they
shouted
and
sped
each
king
an
evil
dart
with
a
flinten
head
and
o
she
staggered
down
o
unpitied
slain
but
in
her
dreadful
swoun
there
was
more
than
pain
for
horror
sprang
from
her
blood
a
spectre
of
death
it
drew
them
thro
the
wood
where
a
chapel
saith
masses
for
souls
that
are
lost
in
the
wilds
of
sin
there
mumbled
ye
pay
cost
ere
to
shrift
ye
win
then
led
them
to
a
bay
tree
by
an
open
grave
where
three
in
three
stony
coffins
clave
which
spake
lo
we
too
were
fair
unto
this
ye
come
ay
ye
who
of
naught
beware
so
spake
and
were
dumb
then
of
fright
and
dread
the
kings
flung
away
bow
the
chapel
bell
slow
rung
with
the
bleak
wind
blow
and
fast
they
fled
thro
the
glade
to
the
castle
hall
god
had
not
been
stayed
they
were
lepers
all
woe
then
to
kings
to

hours

are
the
and

sprays
i
fingered
dreaming
to
the
muted
flow
of
breezes
overhead
and
here
the
word
i
wrote
unwittingly
upon
the
soil
how
long
ago
it
was
i
can
not
tell
the
loneliness
of
unrequited
love
lies
like
a
blank
eternity
between
those
hours
and
these
i
hear
slip
thro
my
heart
i
only
know
all
days
i
ever
seen
must
seem
now
of
some
other
life
apart
iii
will
you
let
any
moment
dip
its
wing
into
your
heart
and
find
no
love
of
me
to
tint
with
deathless
dream
he
said
and
spring
its
flight
to
the
dim
bourne
of
memory
will
you
have
any
grief
that
can
forget
how
grief
should
find
forgetfulness
in
love
and
since
your
soul
in
my
soul
zone
is
set
will
it
sometimes
ask
other
spheres
to
rove
where
touch
and
voice
of
me
shall
not
be
met
ah
no
in
all
the
underdeeps
of
death
or
overheights
of
life
it
still
shall
be
at
tryst
with
mine
thro
moan
or
ecstasy
in
all
yet
ere
a
year
he
draw
no
breath
but
is
another
will
god
let
it
be
iv
by
all
day
i
bent
my
heart
beneath
the
yoke
of
goading
toil
remembering
to
forget
to
still
upon
my
lips
his
kiss
that
woke
me
in
elysian
love
one
word
has
broke
one
stinging
word
of
severance
and
regret
all
day
i
blotted
from
my
eyes
his
face
but
now
at
evening
tide
it
comes
again
and
memories
into
my
darkened
soul
rush
as
the
stars
into
high
heaven
space
as
the
bright
stars
but
ah
tomorrow
when
once
more
i
must
forget
and
see
life
goal
that
was
so
green
with
sering
laurel
hung
tomorrow
and
tomorrow
till
is
wrung
peace
from
the
piteous
hours
i
strive
among
v
no
i
say
unto
all
hearts
that
can
not
rest
for
want
of
love
for
beating
loud
and
lonely
pray
the
great
to
give
you
only
love
that
is
passionless
within
the
breast
pray
that
it
may
not
be
a
haunting
fire
a
vision
that
shall
steal
insatiably
all
beauteous
content
all
sweet
desire
from
faith
and
dream
star
flower
and
song
and
sea
but
seek
that
soul
and
soul
may
meet
together
knowing
they
have
forever
been
but
one
meet
and
be
surest
when
ill
chartless
weather
drives
blinding
gales
of
doubt
across
their
sun
pray
pray
lost
love
uptorn
shall
seem
as
nether
and
rage
beyond
oblivion
vi
after
years
to
you
say
that
love
then
led
us
you
and
me
i
say
was
hate
that
wore
love
wanting
eyes
hate
that
i
could
not
tear
away
the
lies
that
wrapped
you
with
their
silken
sorcery
hate
that
for
you
i
could
not
open
skies
where
beauty
lives
of
her
own
loveliness
that
god
would
give
me
no
omnipotence
to
purge
and
mould
anew
your
soul
numb
sense
aye
hate
that
i
could
love
you
not
tho
love
pent
in
me
ached
with
distress
while
thro
unfathomable
dark
the
prize
seemed
sinking
as
my
soul
from
heaven
above
love
say
you
love
and
hate
rent
us
apart
i
tell
you
hate
alone
so
tears
the
heart
vii
him
after
his
god
who
can
bind
the
stars
eternally
with
but
a
breath
of
spirit
speech
a
thought
who
can
within
earth
arms
lay
the
mad
sea
unseverably
and
count
it
as
sheer
naught
with
his
could
bind
not
you
and
me
for
tho
he
pressed
us
heart
to
burning
heart
and
set
then
to
the
passion
that
enthralls
his
sanction
still
our
souls
stood
apart
as
aliens
beating
fierce
against
the
walls
of
dark
unsympathy
that
would
upstart
stood
aliens
aye
and
would
tho
we
should
meet
beyond
the
oblivion
of
unnumbered
births
upon
some
world
where
time
can
not
repeat
the
feeblest
syllable
that
once
was
earth
love
in
extremis
i
care
not
what
they
say
who
hold
we
should
speak
but
of
life
and
joy
i
have
met
death
in
one
i
love
death
lusting
to
destroy
and
i
have
fought
him
vein
by
vein
loosened
his
cold
and
creeping
clutch
driven
him
from
her
twice
and
thrice
with
might
too
much
yet
with
too
little
for
i
know
that
she
at
last
will
lie
there
still
then
all
my
fire
of
love
shall
fail
to
thaw
that
chill
for
it
will
freeze
light
from
her
eyes
pulse
from
her
breast
and
from
her
soul
me
whom
no
opiate
of
peace
can
console
none
till
i
follow
her
in
time
and
find
her
though
all
dust
deny
with
that
to
be
i
front
the
day
and
fronting
die
over
the
dregs
if
i
had
died
last
year
when
death
and
i
were
at
till
life
slipping
between
blew
her
warm
breath
into
my
heart
again
and
veins
and
opened
my
eyes
and
nulled
my
pains
if
i
had
died
where
would
you
be
you
so
passionate
yet
quick
to
escape
from
passion
mastery
when
clasping
and
kiss
and
touch
are
gone
and
days
and
space
are
between
us
drawn
where
would
you
be
my
arms
you
chose
arms
too
ready
to
seize
and
sin
and
kept
no
burning
forbiddance
in
those
still
eyes
of
yours
or
else
i
think
no
i
unsay
it
no
so
drink
drink
the
last
glass
and
then
my
thought
it
is
that
when
we
reached
the
last
of
pleasure
we
are
like
two
who
fought
who
have
no
common
love
but
love
of
fighting
so
does
our
passion
prove
for
it
is
only
passion
such
tho
clasping
and
kiss
and
touch
were
love
a
little
and
sometimes
maybe
much
when
soul
and
heaven
looked
far
away
and
flesh
seemed
only
flesh
and
clay
but
it
is
ended
so
drink
how
you
ruined
me
as
i
have
you
all
that
you
might
have
been
and
now
all
that
i
was
until
is
clear
i
should
have
died
in
spring
last
year
bewitched
a
devon
why
do
i
babble
of
bitter
chills
and
icy
trees
and
snowy
fallows
why
do
i
shudder
as
twilight
spills
a
ghostly
gray
and
the
bent
moon
sallows
the
moor
with
her
wicked
flame
why
do
the
gibbering
croons
of
the
hag
in
her
hut
by
the
wood
go
muttering
muttering
in
my
blood
till
the
hoot
of
an
owl
on
the
snag
of
a
tomb
breaks
out
of
the
gloom
like
the
wail
of
a
witch
name
ugh
it
is
drawing
my
feet
away
the
road
gone
the
moonlet
sunken
what
shall
i
do
if
it
comes
to
fray
with
fiends
invisible
wild
and
drunken
fiends
on
a
churchless
fell
ha
is
it
cracking
of
ice
in
the
bog
that
is
clutching
my
throat
or
devils
gnawing
the
widow
shoat
by
the
cross
of
the
christ
there
a
fog
that
is
black
as
at
my
back
they
are
dragging
me
down
to
hell
quarrel
and
is
it
so
that
two
who
stand
heart
closed
in
heart
hand
knit
to
hand
can
let
love
go
asunder
so
speak
hard
not
understand
that
one
asks
much
one
gives
too
small
and
so
is
lost
it
may
be
all
that
for
a
touch
of
pride
we
such
a
heaven
can
let
fall
no
but
to
fate
say
with
me
go
death
may
bring
dross
but
this
i
know
can
abate
life
harshest
hate
so
loving
i
bend
of
the
flesh
monte
we
met
upon
the
street
quick
passion
sprung
into
the
eye
of
each
no
dilettante
heat
for
though
i
do
not
love
her
now
beseech
you
signor
do
you
think
we
could
face
so
in
any
spot
nor
fear
to
leap
the
fatal
brink
into
each
other
arms
that
once
hell
self
could
make
us
shrink
no
no
such
love
as
ours
stabbed
peace
and
burnt
the
flesh
to
mad
it
scorned
the
simple
powers
of
sympathy
and
mild
repose
and
had
one
thirst
alone
to
hold
each
other
mouth
to
still
unsated
mouth
until
perchance
the
cold
and
damp
of
death
should
end
some
night
its
drouth
but
only
day
would
come
unlock
our
arms
and
show
us
duty
eye
calm
pale
and
sternly
dumb
and
so
we
swear
never
to
kiss
or
sigh
again
for
well
we
knew
god
grants
such
boons
only
to
man
and
wife
but
night
distilled
the
dew
of
loneliness
and
so
once
more
that
life
and
how
was
the
spell
burst
each
long
embrace
seemed
sweeter
than
the
last
each
dulling
nurst
the
shame
until
i
tore
me
from
the
past
and
cried
i
hate
my
soul
and
thine
and
this
false
love
she
fainted
fell
i
kissed
her
lips
stole
the
ring
that
choked
her
finger
said
farewell
and
since
then
time
has
pressed
ten
restless
years
but
if
i
saw
her
lay
her
hand
upon
her
breast
as
once
she
used
and
send
her
soul
to
say
a
word
with
those
dark
eyes
ha
what
is
that
signor
respect
my
wife
that
as
may
be
you
rise
adieu
signor
fate
deals
the
cards
in
life
a
death
song
a
toll
no
bell
and
say
no
prayer
let
no
rose
die
on
my
bier
all
i
hoped
for
shall
appear
or
be
well
forgotten
there
like
the
waves
of
yesteryear
toll
no
bell
and
drop
no
sigh
bear
me
softly
to
the
tomb
life
was
dark
but
light
is
nigh
light
no
sorrow
shall
consume
and
no
kiss
of
love
or
cry
toll
no
bell
the
clod
will
toll
grief
enough
for
any
ear
when
the
last
has
sounded
clear
know
that
i
have
reached
the
goal
which
is
god
seen
thro
no
tear
on
ballyteigue
bay
i
heard
the
three
nights
come
keening
and
crying
to
my
door
why
will
they
affright
me
with
their
threening
forevermore
o
have
they
no
grave
in
the
salt
to
lay
them
in
do
they
know
do
they
know
with
their
cold
dead
faces
know
my
sin
there
blood
on
my
soul
the
lord
can
not
wipe
it
away
with
his
own
blood
i
beaten
my
breast
with
blows
that
stripe
it
and
burned
his
rood
with
kisses
that
shrivel
my
lips
that
shrivel
to
sin
on
the
air
but
the
night
and
the
storm
cry
on
me
evil
does
he
not
care
there
blood
on
my
soul
but
then
she
should
never
have
said
it
was
the
child
and
for
she
knew
i
never
forgive
her
i
grew
so
wild
there
was
just
one
thing
to
be
done
to
kill
her
just
one
no
more
i
took
the
keen
steel
one
stroke
would
still
her
i
counted
four
and
she
fell
fell
down
on
the
kelp
none
near
her
but
when
she
lay
so
fair
i
kissed
her
because
i
knew
i
should
fear
her
and
smoothed
her
hair
and
shut
her
two
eyes
that
fixed
me
fearless
of
death
and
pain
and
the
blood
on
my
hand
i
wiped
off
tearless
and
that
on
my
brain
and
i
buried
her
quickly
the
cover
her
grave
with
spines
i
pray
that
each
in
its
fall
will
prick
her
and
shove
her
to
colder
clay
but
yonder
she
up
and
moans
in
the
heather
a
whimpering
thing
i
bury
her
deeper
in
autumn
weather
or
winter
or
spring
and
then
if
she
comes
with
them
still
to
call
me
each
night
i
tell
her
loud
he
was
mine
and
laugh
when
they
try
to
pall
me
with
sea
and
shroud
and
i
swear
not
to
care
for
christ
or
devil
they
skitter
back
to
the
waves
at
that
and
be
gone
with
their
revel
god
spare
me
the
rack
this
clan
of
tobacco
outlaws
in
kentucky
during
cast
such
disgrace
on
her
good
name
as
years
will
not
suffice
to
erase
see
them
mount
in
the
dead
of
night
men
three
hundred
strong
armed
and
silent
masked
from
the
light
speeding
swartly
along
what
is
their
errand
manly
fight
clench
with
a
manly
foe
i
would
rather
be
dead
of
wrong
than
ride
among
them
so
see
them
enter
the
sleeping
town
hear
the
warning
shot
keep
to
your
beds
free
men
down
down
dare
you
to
move
dare
not
these
are
your
masters
these
who
crown
black
anarchy
their
king
i
would
rather
my
hand
should
rot
than
have
it
do
this
thing
see
them
steal
to
the
house
they
seek
brave
men
o
brave
all
there
lies
a
sick
boy
who
comes
forth
at
call
a
woman
go
in
you
bitch
they
reek
give
us
the
old
man
out
rather
my
bitten
tongue
should
fall
to
palsy
than
so
shout
and
they
have
him
the
old
man
now
bound
with
nine
beside
one
a
judge
of
the
law
grave
brow
sworn
by
it
to
bide
lash
him
a
hundred
lashes
plow
a
back
with
pain
god
shall
we
let
such
cowards
ride
and
burn
and
beat
and
stain
o
the
shame
and
the
bitter
shame
that
thus
across
our
land
crime
can
arise
and
write
her
name
broad
with
a
bloody
hand
o
the
shame
and
the
bitter
shame
upon
our
chivalry
i
would
rather
have
led
the
band
that
diced
on
calvary
so
ride
on
and
ride
avenging
wrongly
wrong
but
when
the
children
at
your
side
grow
lawless
up
and
strong
when
at
their
drunken
hands
you
died
as
beasts
beside
your
door
you
will
repent
god
knows
it
long
these
nights
to
hell
made
honor
the
who
murdered
honor
to
men
who
leave
their
homes
and
children
safe
asleep
to
take
the
cover
of
night
and
fright
women
that
wake
and
weep
honor
again
to
those
who
mount
for
blood
hounds
in
a
pack
but
let
us
honor
the
most
of
all
men
that
shoot
in
the
back
for
it
is
good
to
fare
and
frighten
helpless
things
and
how
good
with
a
torch
to
scorch
a
poor
man
harvestings
but
if
you
would
do
something
high
and
blameless
brave
not
black
ride
till
you
find
a
peaceful
man
then
shoot
shoot
in
the
back
why
there
was
one
in
palestine
who
gave
a
certain
kiss
fine
friends
do
you
give
who
live
in
a
land
not
far
from
this
for
