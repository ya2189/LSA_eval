introduction
after
the
very
cordial
reception
given
to
the
poems
of
the
angel
in
the
house
which
their
author
generously
made
accessible
to
the
readers
of
these
little
books
it
is
evident
that
another
volume
from
the
same
clear
singer
of
the
purity
of
household
love
requires
no
introduction
i
have
only
in
the
name
of
the
readers
to
thank
coventry
patmore
for
his
liberality
and
wish
him
say
rather
assure
him
of
the
best
return
he
seeks
in
a
wide

book

from
frederick
graham
mother
i
smile
at
your
alarms
i
own
indeed
my
cousin
charms
but
like
all
nursery
maladies
love
is
not
badly
taken
twice
have
you
forgotten
charlotte
hayes
my
playmate
in
the
pleasant
days
at
knatchley
and
her
sister
anne
the
twins
so
made
on
the
same
plan
that
one
wore
blue
the
other
white
to
mark
them
to
their
father
sight
and
how
at
knatchley
harvesting
you
bade
me
kiss
her
in
the
ring
like
anne
and
all
the
others
you
that
never
of
my
sickness
knew
will
laugh
yet
had
i
the
disease
and
gravely
if
the
signs
are
these
as
ere
the
spring
has
any
power
the
almond
branch
all
turns
to
flower
though
not
a
leaf
is
out
so
she
the
bloom
of
life
provoked
in
me
and
hard
till
then
and
selfish
i
was
thenceforth
nought
but
sanctity
and
service
life
was
mere
delight
in
being
wholly
good
and
right
as
she
was
just
without
a
slur
honouring
myself
no
less
than
her
obeying
in
the
loneliest
place
to
the
slightest
gesture
grace
assured
that
one
so
fair
so
true
he
only
served
that
was
so
too
for
me
hence
weak
towards
the
weak
no
more
the
unnested
blackbird
shriek
startled
the
wood
on
high
wander
the
gadding
butterfly
unscared
by
my
flung
cap
the
bee
rifling
the
hollyhock
in
glee
was
no
more
trapp
with
his
own
flower
and
for
his
honey
slain
her
power
from
great
things
even
to
the
grass
through
which
the
unfenced
footways
pass
was
law
and
that
which
keeps
the
law
cherubic
gaiety
and
awe
day
was
her
doing
and
the
lark
had
reason
for
his
song
the
dark
in
anagram
innumerous
spelt
her
name
with
stars
that
throbb
and
felt
the
sad
summit
of
delight
to
wake
and
weep
for
her
at
night
she
turn
to
triumph
or
to
shame
the
strife
of
every
childish
game
the
heart
would
come
into
my
throat
at
rosebuds
remote
in
opposition
or
consent
each
thing
or
person
or
event
or
seeming
neutral
all
in
the
live
electric
air
awoke
took
aspect
and
in
her
a
centre
of
unrest
yea
stocks
and
stones
within
me
bred
anxieties
of
joy
and
dread
o
bright
apocalyptic
sky
childhood
far
and
nigh
mystery
and
obscuration
none
yet
nowhere
any
moon
or
sun
what
reason
for
these
sighs
what
hope
daunting
with
its
audacious
scope
the
disconcerted
heart
affects
these
ceremonies
and
respects
why
stratagems
in
everything
why
why
not
kiss
her
in
the
ring
is
nothing
strange
that
warriors
bold
whose
fierce
forecasting
eyes
behold
the
city
they
desire
to
sack
humbly
begin
their
proud
attack
by
delving
ditches
two
miles
off
aware
how
the
fair
place
would
scoff
at
hasty
wooing
but
o
child
why
thus
approach
thy
playmate
mild
one
morning
when
it
flush
my
thought
that
what
in
me
such
wonder
wrought
was
call
in
men
and
women
love
and
sick
with
vanity
thereof
i
saying
loud
love
her
told
my
secret
to
myself
behold
a
crisis
in
my
mystery
for
suddenly
i
seem
to
be
whirl
round
and
bound
with
showers
of
threads
as
when
the
furious
spider
sheds
captivity
upon
the
fly
to
still
his
buzzing
till
he
die
only
with
me
the
bonds
that
flew
enfolding
thrill
me
through
and
through
with
bliss
beyond
aught
heaven
can
have
and
pride
to
dream
myself
her
slave
a
long
green
slip
of
wilder
land
with
knatchley
wood
on
either
hand
sunder
our
home
from
hers
this
day
glad
was
i
as
i
went
her
way
i
stretch
my
arms
to
the
sky
and
sprang
the
elastic
sod
and
sang
love
her
love
her
to
an
air
which
with
the
words
came
then
and
there
and
even
now
when
i
would
know
all
was
not
always
dull
and
low
i
mind
me
awhile
of
the
sweet
strain
love
taught
me
in
that
lonely
lane
such
glories
fade
with
no
more
mark
than
when
the
sunset
dies
to
dark
they
pass
the
rapture
and
the
grace
ineffable
their
only
trace
a
heart
which
having
felt
no
less
than
pure
and
perfect
happiness
is
duly
dainty
of
delight
a
patient
poignant
appetite
for
pleasures
that
exceed
so
much
the
poor
things
which
the
world
calls
such
that
when
these
lure
it
then
you
may
the
lion
with
a
wisp
of
hay
that
charlotte
whom
we
scarcely
knew
from
anne
but
by
her
ribbons
blue
was
loved
anne
less
than
look
at
shows
that
liking
still
by
favour
goes
this
love
is
a
divinity
and
holds
his
high
election
free
of
human
merit
or
let
say
a
child
by
ladies
call
to
play
but
careless
of
their
becks
and
wiles
till
seeing
one
who
sits
and
smiles
like
any
else
yet
only
charms
he
cries
to
come
into
her
arms
then
for
my
cousins
fear
me
not
none
ever
loved
because
he
ought
fatal
were
else
this
graceful
house
so
full
of
light
from
ladies
brows
there
mary
heaven
in
her
appears
like
sunshine
through
the
shower
bright
tears
mildred
of
earth
yet
happier
far
than
most
men
thoughts
of
heaven
are
but
for
honoria
heaven
and
earth
seal
amity
in
her
sweet
birth
the
noble
girl
with
whom
she
talks
she
knights
first
with
her
smile
she
walks
stands
dances
to
such
sweet
effect
alone
she
seems
to
move
erect
the
brightest
and
the
chastest
brow
rules
a
cheek
which
seems
to
show
that
love
as
a
mere
vague
suspense
of
apprehensive
innocence
perturbs
her
heart
love
without
aim
or
object
like
the
sunlit
flame
that
in
the
vestals
temple
glow
without
the
image
of
a
god
and
this
simplicity
most
pure
she
sets
off
with
no
less
allure
of
culture
subtly
skill
to
raise
the
power
the
pride
and
mutual
praise
of
human
personality
above
the
common
sort
so
high
it
makes
such
homely
souls
as
mine
marvel
how
brightly
life
may
shine
how
you
would
love
her
even
in
dress
she
makes
the
common
mode
express
new
knowledge
of
what
fit
so
well
virtue
gaily
visible
nay
but
her
silken
sash
to
me
were
more
than
all
morality
had
not
the
old
sweet
feverous
ill
left
me
the
master
of
my
will
so
mother
feel
at
rest
and
please
to
send
my
books
on
board
with
these
when
i
go
hence
all
idle
hours
shall
help
my
pleasures
and
my
powers
i
time
you
know
to
fill
my
post
and
yet
make
up
for
schooling
lost
through
young
they
all
speak
german
with
ease
and
this
with
greek
which
churchill
thought
i
knew
and
history
which
i
fail
in
too
will
stop
a
gap
i
somewhat
dread
after
the
happy
life
i
led
with
these
my
friends
and
sweet
be
to
abridge
the
space
from
them
to
me
ii
from
graham
my
child
honoria
churchill
sways
a
double
power
through
charlotte
hayes
in
minds
to
memory
pledged
the
second
cupid
born
i
saw
and
trembled
for
the
day
when
you
should
see
her
beauty
gay
and
pure
as
that
show
outside
a
blush
and
inside
snow
her
high
and
touching
elegance
of
order
life
as
free
as
chance
ah
haste
from
her
bewitching
side
no
friend
for
you
far
less
a
bride
but
warning
from
a
hope
so
wild
i
wrong
you
yet
this
know
my
child
he
that
but
once
too
nearly
hears
the
music
of
forefended
spheres
is
thenceforth
lonely
and
for
all
his
days
like
one
who
treads
the
wall
of
china
and
on
this
hand
sees
cities
and
their
civilities
and
on
the
other
lions
well
your
rash
reply
i
thus
foretell
good
is
the
knowledge
of
what
fair
though
bought
with
temporal
despair
yes
good
for
one
but
not
for
two
will
it
content
a
wife
that
you
should
pine
for
love
in
love
embrace
through
having
known
a
happier
grace
and
break
with
inward
sighs
your
rest
because
though
good
she
not
the
best
you
would
you
think
be
just
and
kind
and
keep
your
counsel
you
will
find
you
can
not
such
a
secret
keep
out
like
murder
in
your
sleep
a
touch
will
tell
it
though
for
pride
she
may
her
bitter
knowledge
hide
and
while
she
accepts
love
you
twice
despise
what
you
deceive
i
send
the
books
dear
child
adieu
tell
me
of
all
you
are
and
do
i
know
thank
god
it
be
need
no
veil
you
and
me
iii
from
frederick
the
multitude
of
voices
blithe
of
early
day
the
hissing
scythe
across
the
dew
drawn
and
withdrawn
the
noisy
peacock
on
the
lawn
these
and
the
sun
gleam
this
morning
chased
the
sweetest
dream
that
shed
penitential
grace
on
life
forgetful
commonplace
yet
was
no
sweeter
than
the
spell
to
which
i
woke
to
say
farewell
noon
finds
me
many
a
mile
removed
from
her
who
must
not
be
beloved
and
us
the
waste
sea
soon
shall
part
heaving
for
aye
without
a
heart
mother
what
need
to
warn
me
so
love
miss
churchill
ah
no
no
i
view
enchanted
from
afar
and
love
her
as
i
love
a
star
for
not
to
speak
of
colder
fear
which
keeps
my
fancy
calm
i
hear
under
her
life
gay
progress
hurl
the
wheels
of
the
preponderant
world
set
sharp
with
swords
that
fool
to
slay
who
blunders
from
a
poor
byway
to
covet
beauty
with
a
crown
of
earthly
blessing
added
on
and
she
so
much
it
seems
to
me
beyond
all
women
womanly
i
dread
to
think
how
he
should
fare
who
came
so
near
as
to
despair
iv
from
frederick
yonder
the
sombre
vessel
rides
where
my
obscure
condition
hides
waves
scud
to
shore
against
the
wind
that
flings
the
sprinkling
surf
behind
in
port
the
bickering
pennons
show
which
way
the
ships
would
gladly
go
through
edgecumb
park
the
rooted
trees
are
tossing
reckless
in
the
breeze
on
top
of
edgecumb
tower
as
foils
not
foibles
of
its
power
the
light
vanes
do
themselves
adjust
to
every
veering
of
the
gust
by
me
alone
may
nought
be
given
to
guidance
of
the
airs
of
heaven
in
battle
or
peace
in
calm
or
storm
should
i
my
daily
task
perform
better
a
thousand
times
for
love
who
should
my
secret
soul
reprove
beholding
one
like
her
a
man
longs
to
lay
down
his
life
how
can
aught
to
itself
seem
thus
enough
when
i
have
so
much
need
thereof
blest
in
her
place
blissful
is
she
and
i
departing
seem
to
be
like
the
strange
waif
that
comes
to
run
a
few
days
flaming
near
the
sun
and
carries
back
through
boundless
night
its
lessening
memory
of
light
oh
my
dear
mother
i
confess
to
a
deep
grief
of
homelessness
unfelt
save
once
before
is
years
since
such
a
shower
of
girlish
tears
disgraced
me
but
this
wretched
inn
at
plymouth
is
so
full
of
din
talkings
and
trampings
to
and
fro
and
then
my
ship
to
which
i
go
is
no
more
home
i
dread
as
strange
the
life
i
long
have
led
and
as
when
first
i
went
to
school
and
found
the
horror
of
a
rule
which
only
ask
to
be
obey
i
lay
and
wept
of
dawn
afraid
and
thought
with
bursting
heart
of
one
who
from
her
little
wayward
son
required
obedience
but
above
obedience
still
regarded
love
so
change
i
that
enchanting
place
the
abode
of
innocence
and
grace
and
gaiety
without
reproof
for
the
black
louring
roof
blind
and
inevitable
law
which
makes
light
duties
burdens
awe
which
is
not
reverence
laughters
at
cost
of
purities
profaned
and
whatsoever
most
may
stir
remorseful
passion
towards
her
whom
to
behold
is
to
depart
from
all
defect
of
life
and
heart
but
mother
i
shall
go
on
shore
and
see
my
cousin
yet
once
more
wild
to
hope
for
her
you
say
i
torn
and
cast
those
words
away
surely
there
hope
for
life
is
well
love
without
hope
impossible
so
if
i
love
it
is
that
hope
is
not
outside
the
outer
scope
of
fancy
you
speak
truth
this
hour
i
must
resist
or
lose
the
power
what
and
when
some
short
months
are
be
not
much
other
than
before
drop
from
the
bright
and
virtuous
sphere
in
which
i
held
but
while
she
dear
for
daily
life
dull
senseless
mood
slay
the
fine
nerves
of
gratitude
and
sweet
allegiance
which
i
owe
whether
the
debt
be
weal
or
woe
nay
mother
i
forewarn
prefer
to
want
for
all
in
wanting
her
for
all
love
best
is
not
bereft
ever
from
him
to
whom
is
left
the
trust
that
god
will
not
deceive
his
creature
fashion
to
believe
the
prophecies
of
pure
desire
not
loss
not
death
my
love
shall
tire
a
mystery
does
my
heart
foretell
nor
do
i
press
the
oracle
for
explanations
leave
me
alone
and
let
in
me
love
will
be
done
from
frederick
fashion
by
heaven
and
by
art
so
is
she
that
she
makes
the
heart
ache
and
with
tears
that
grace
so
lovely
fair
should
have
for
place
deeming
itself
at
home
the
while
the
unworthy
earth
to
see
her
smile
amid
this
waste
of
pain
and
sin
as
only
knowing
the
heaven
within
is
sweet
and
does
for
pity
stir
passion
to
be
her
minister
wherefore
last
night
i
lay
awake
and
said
lord
for
thy
love
sake
give
not
this
darling
child
of
thine
to
care
less
reverent
than
mine
and
as
true
faith
was
in
my
word
i
trust
i
trust
that
i
was
heard
the
waves
this
morning
sped
to
land
and
shouted
hoarse
to
touch
the
strand
where
spring
that
goes
not
out
to
sea
lay
laughing
in
her
lovely
glee
and
so
my
life
was
sunlit
spray
and
tumult
as
once
more
for
long
farewell
did
i
draw
near
my
cousin
desperately
dear
faint
fierce
the
truth
that
hope
was
none
gleam
like
the
lightning
in
the
sun
yet
hope
i
had
and
joy
thereof
the
father
of
love
is
hope
though
love
lives
orphan
on
when
hope
is
dead
and
out
of
my
immediate
dread
and
crisis
of
the
coming
hour
did
hope
itself
draw
sudden
power
so
the
still
brooding
storm
in
spring
makes
all
the
birds
begin
to
sing
mother
your
foresight
did
not
err
i
lost
the
world
and
not
won
her
and
yet
ah
laugh
not
when
you
think
what
cup
of
life
i
sought
to
drink
the
bold
said
i
have
climb
to
bliss
absurd
impossible
as
this
with
nought
to
help
them
but
so
great
a
heart
it
fascinates
their
fate
if
ever
heaven
heard
man
desire
mine
being
made
of
must
come
to
pass
and
it
will
be
that
she
will
wait
when
she
shall
see
this
evening
how
i
go
to
get
by
means
unknown
i
know
not
yet
quite
what
but
ground
whereon
to
stand
and
plead
more
plainly
for
her
hand
and
so
i
raved
and
cast
in
hope
a
superstitious
horoscope
and
still
though
something
in
her
face
portended
with
such
a
grace
it
burthen
me
with
thankfulness
nothing
was
credible
but
therefore
through
time
close
pressure
bold
i
praised
myself
and
boastful
told
my
deeds
at
acre
strain
the
chance
i
had
of
honour
and
advance
in
war
to
come
and
would
not
see
sad
silence
meant
this
to
me
when
half
my
precious
hour
was
gone
she
rose
to
meet
a
vaughan
and
as
the
image
of
the
moon
breaks
up
within
some
still
lagoon
that
feels
the
soft
wind
suddenly
or
tide
fresh
flowing
from
the
sea
and
turns
to
giddy
flames
that
go
over
the
water
to
and
fro
thus
when
he
took
her
hand
her
lovely
gravity
of
light
was
scatter
into
many
smiles
and
flatting
weakness
hope
beguiles
no
more
my
heart
dear
mother
he
by
jealous
looks
me
with
nought
to
do
and
fondly
fain
to
hear
her
singing
once
again
i
stay
and
turn
her
music
then
came
she
with
me
to
the
door
honoria
i
said
by
my
despair
familiar
made
bless
you
oh
to
have
back
then
and
fallen
upon
her
neck
and
wept
and
said
friend
i
owe
you
all
i
am
and
have
and
hope
for
call
for
some
poor
service
let
me
prove
to
you
or
him
here
whom
you
love
my
duty
any
solemn
task
for
life
whole
course
is
all
i
ask
then
she
must
surely
have
wept
too
and
said
friend
what
can
you
do
and
i
should
have
replied
pray
you
and
him
three
times
and
all
day
morning
noon
and
night
my
life
shall
be
so
high
and
right
that
never
saint
yet
scaled
the
stairs
of
heaven
with
more
availing
prayers
but
this
and
as
good
god
shall
bless
somehow
my
end
i
do
no
less
i
had
no
right
to
speak
oh
shame
so
rich
a
love
so
poor
a
claim
my
mother
now
my
only
friend
farewell
the
which
you
send
i
shall
not
want
and
so
return
give
them
away
or
sell
or
burn
i
write
from
malta
would
i
might
but
be
your
little
child
and
feel
your
arms
about
me
fold
against
this
loneliness
and
cold
vi
from
graham
the
folly
of
young
girls
they
doff
their
pride
to
smooth
success
and
scoff
at
far
more
noble
fire
and
might
that
woo
them
from
the
dust
of
fight
but
frederick
now
the
storm
is
past
your
sky
should
not
remain
a
dull
and
oh
beware
of
nourishing
for
zest
despair
my
child
remember
you
have
twice
heartily
loved
then
why
not
thrice
or
ten
times
but
a
wise
man
shuns
to
cry
over
more
than
once
i
not
say
that
a
young
man
soul
is
scarcely
measure
of
the
whole
earthly
and
heavenly
universe
to
which
he
inveterately
prefers
the
one
beloved
woman
best
speak
to
the
senses
interest
which
brooks
no
mystery
nor
delay
frankly
reflect
my
son
and
say
was
there
no
secret
hour
of
those
pass
at
her
side
in
sarum
close
when
to
your
spirit
sick
alarm
it
seem
that
all
her
marvellous
charm
was
marvellously
fled
her
grace
of
voice
adornment
movement
face
was
what
already
heart
and
eye
had
ponder
to
satiety
amid
so
the
good
of
life
was
until
some
laugh
not
heard
before
some
novel
fashion
in
her
hair
or
style
of
putting
back
her
chair
restored
the
heavens
gather
thence
the
inference
yet
blame
not
beauty
which
beguiles
with
lovely
motions
and
sweet
smiles
which
while
they
please
us
pass
away
the
spirit
to
lofty
thoughts
that
stay
and
lift
the
whole
of
unless
you
take
the
vision
to
wife
which
then
seems
lost
or
serves
to
slake
desire
as
when
a
lovely
lake
far
off
scarce
fills
the
exulting
eye
of
one
athirst
who
comes
thereby
and
inappreciably
sips
the
deep
with
disappointed
lips
to
fail
is
sorrow
yet
confess
that
love
pays
dearly
for
success
no
blame
to
beauty
let
complain
of
the
heart
which
can
so
ill
sustain
delight
our
griefs
declare
our
fall
but
how
much
more
our
joys
they
pall
with
plucking
and
celestial
mirth
can
find
no
footing
on
the
earth
more
than
the
bird
of
paradise
which
only
lives
the
while
it
flies
think
also
how
suit
your
pride
to
have
this
woman
for
a
bride
her
faults
she
one
of
those
to
whom
the
world
last
polish
owes
a
novel
grace
which
all
who
aspire
to
courtliest
custom
must
acquire
the
world
the
sphere
she
made
to
charm
which
you
have
shunn
as
if
harm
oh
law
perverse
that
loneliness
breeds
love
society
success
though
young
now
late
in
life
to
train
yourself
for
such
a
wife
so
she
would
suit
herself
to
you
as
women
when
they
marry
do
for
since
is
for
our
dignity
our
lords
should
sit
like
lords
on
high
we
willingly
deteriorate
to
a
step
below
our
rulers
state
and
is
the
commonest
of
things
to
see
an
angel
gay
with
wings
lean
weakly
on
a
mortal
arm
honoria
would
put
off
the
charm
of
lofty
grace
that
caught
your
love
for
fear
you
should
not
seem
above
herself
in
fashion
and
degree
as
in
true
merit
thus
you
see
little
kindness
wisdom
none
to
light
your
cot
with
such
a
sun
vii
from
frederick
write
not
my
mother
her
dear
name
with
the
least
word
or
hint
of
blame
who
else
shall
discommend
her
choice
i
giving
it
my
hearty
voice
wed
me
ah
never
near
her
come
the
knowledge
of
the
narrow
home
far
fly
from
her
dear
face
that
shows
the
sunshine
lovelier
than
the
rose
the
sordid
gravity
they
wear
who
poverty
base
burthen
bear
and
all
are
poor
who
come
to
miss
their
custom
though
a
crown
be
this
my
hope
was
that
the
wheels
of
fate
for
my
exceeding
need
might
wait
and
she
unseen
amidst
all
eyes
move
sightless
till
i
sought
the
prize
with
honour
in
an
equal
field
but
then
came
vaughan
to
whom
i
yield
with
grace
as
much
as
any
man
in
such
cause
to
another
can
had
she
been
mine
it
seems
to
me
that
i
had
that
integrity
and
only
joy
in
her
delight
but
each
is
his
own
favourite
in
love
the
thought
to
bring
me
rest
is
that
of
us
she
takes
the
best
was
but
to
see
him
to
be
sure
that
choice
for
her
remain
no
more
his
brow
so
gaily
clear
of
craft
his
wit
the
timely
truth
that
to
find
itself
so
well
express
his
words
abundant
yet
the
best
his
spirit
of
such
handsome
show
you
mark
not
that
his
looks
were
so
his
bearing
prospects
birth
all
these
might
well
with
small
suit
greatly
please
how
greatly
when
she
saw
arise
the
reflex
sweetness
of
her
eyes
in
his
and
every
breath
defer
humbly
its
bated
life
to
her
whilst
power
and
kindness
of
command
which
women
can
no
more
withstand
than
we
their
grace
were
still
unquell
and
force
and
flattery
both
her
softness
say
i
worthy
i
grew
in
her
presence
cold
and
shy
it
awed
me
as
an
angel
might
in
raiment
of
reproachful
light
her
gay
looks
told
my
sombre
mood
that
what
not
happy
is
not
good
and
just
because
was
life
to
please
death
to
repel
her
truth
and
ease
deserted
me
i
strove
to
talk
and
stammer
foolishness
my
walk
was
like
a
drunkard
if
she
took
my
arm
it
stiffen
ached
and
shook
a
likely
wooer
blame
her
not
nor
ever
say
dear
mother
aught
against
that
perfectness
which
is
my
strength
as
once
it
was
my
bliss
and
do
not
chafe
at
social
rules
leave
that
to
charlatans
and
fools
clay
grafts
and
clods
conceive
the
rose
so
base
still
fathers
best
life
owes
itself
to
bread
enough
thereof
and
easy
days
condition
love
and
kindly
train
love
roses
thrive
no
more
pale
scentless
petals
five
which
moisten
the
considerate
eye
to
see
what
haste
they
make
to
die
but
heavens
of
colour
and
perfume
which
month
by
month
renew
the
bloom
of
graces
when
the
year
in
all
the
natural
grove
is
sere

nought
then
bright
let
be
the
air
about
my
lonely
cloud
of
care
viii
from
frederick
religion
duty
books
work
friends
good
advice
but
there
it
ends
i
sick
for
what
these
have
not
got
send
no
more
books
they
help
me
not
i
do
my
work
the
void
there
still
which
carefullest
duty
can
not
fill
what
though
the
inaugural
hour
of
right
comes
ever
with
a
keen
delight
little
relieves
the
labour
heat
disgust
oft
crowns
it
when
complete
and
life
in
fact
is
not
less
dull
for
being
very
dutiful
stately
homes
of
england
lo
beautiful
they
stand
they
owe
how
much
to
nameless
things
like
me
their
beauty
of
security
but
who
can
long
a
low
toil
mend
by
looking
to
a
lofty
end
and
let
me
since
is
truth
confess
the
void
not
fill
by
godliness
god
is
a
tower
without
a
stair
and
his
perfection
love
despair
is
he
shall
judge
me
when
i
die
he
suckles
with
the
hissing
fly
the
spider
gazes
calmly
down
whilst
rapine
grips
the
helpless
town
his
vast
love
holds
all
this
and
more
in
consternation
i
adore
nor
can
i
ease
this
aching
gulf
with
friends
the
pictures
of
myself
then
marvel
not
that
i
recur
from
each
and
all
of
these
to
her
for
more
of
heaven
than
her
have
i
no
sensitive
capacity
had
i
but
her
ah
what
the
gain
of
owning
aught
but
that
domain
nay
heaven
extent
however
much
can
not
be
more
than
many
such
and
she
being
mine
should
god
to
me
say
my
child
i
give
to
thee
heaven
besides
what
could
i
then
but
as
a
child
to
him
complain
that
whereas
my
dear
father
gave
a
little
space
for
me
to
have
in
his
great
garden
now
i
that
indeed
but
all
the
rest
which
somehow
makes
it
seem
i
got
all
but
my
only
plot
enough
was
that
for
my
weak
hand
to
tend
my
heart
to
understand
oh
the
sick
fact
her
and
me
there
naught
and
half
a
world
of
sea
ix
from
frederick
in
two
in
less
than
two
hours
more
i
set
my
foot
on
english
shore
two
years
untrod
and
strange
to
tell
nigh
miss
through
last
night
storm
there
fell
a
man
from
the
shrouds
that
roar
to
quench
even
the
billows
blast
and
drench
besides
me
none
was
near
to
mark
his
loud
cry
in
the
louder
dark
dark
save
when
lightning
show
the
deeps
standing
about
in
stony
heaps
no
time
for
choice
a
rope
a
flash
that
flamed
as
he
rose
a
dizzy
splash
a
strange
inopportune
delight
of
mounting
with
the
billowy
might
and
falling
with
a
thrill
again
of
pleasure
shot
from
feet
to
brain
and
both
paced
deck
ere
any
knew
our
peril
round
us
press
the
crew
with
wonder
in
the
eyes
of
most
as
if
the
man
who
had
loved
and
lost
honoria
dared
no
more
than
that
my
days
have
else
been
stale
and
flat
this
life
at
best
if
justly
scann
a
tedious
walk
by
the
other
strand
with
here
and
there
cast
up
a
piece
of
coral
or
of
ambergris
which
boasted
of
abroad
we
ignore
the
burden
of
the
barren
shore
i
seldom
write
for
be
still
of
how
the
nerves
refuse
to
thrill
how
throughout
days
i
can
not
recollect
her
face
how
to
my
heart
her
name
to
tell
is
beating
on
a
broken
bell
and
to
fill
up
the
abhorrent
gulf
scarce
loving
her
i
hate
myself
yet
latterly
with
strange
delight
rich
tides
have
risen
in
the
night
and
sweet
dreams
chased
the
fancies
dense
of
waking
life
dull
somnolence
i
see
her
as
i
knew
her
grace
already
glory
in
her
face
i
move
about
i
can
not
rest
for
the
proud
brain
and
joyful
breast
i
have
of
her
or
else
i
float
the
pilot
of
an
idle
boat
alone
alone
with
sky
and
sea
and
her
the
third
simplicity
or
mildred
to
some
question
cries
her
merry
meaning
in
her
eyes
ball
oh
frederick
will
go
honoria
will
be
there
and
lo
as
moisture
sweet
my
seeing
blurs
to
hear
my
name
so
link
with
hers
a
mirror
joins
by
guilty
chance
either
averted
watchful
glance
or
with
me
in
the
blaze
her
brilliant
mildness
threads
the
maze
our
thoughts
are
lovely
and
each
word
is
music
in
the
music
heard
and
all
things
seem
but
parts
to
be
of
one
persistent
harmony
by
which
i
made
divinely
bold
the
secret
which
she
knows
is
told
and
laughing
with
a
lofty
bliss
of
innocent
accord
we
kiss
about
her
neck
my
pleasure
weeps
against
my
lip
the
silk
vein
leaps
then
says
an
angel
or
night
if
yours
you
seek
not
her
delight
although
by
some
strange
witchery
it
seems
you
kiss
her
is
not
she
but
whilst
you
languish
at
the
side
of
a
phantasmal
bride
surely
a
dragon
and
strong
tower
guard
the
true
lady
in
her
bower
and
i
say
my
lord
amen
and
the
true
lady
kiss
again
or
else
some
wasteful
malady
devours
her
shape
and
dims
her
eye
no
charms
are
left
where
all
were
rife
except
her
voice
which
is
her
life
wherewith
she
for
her
foolish
fear
says
trembling
you
love
me
dear
and
i
reply
i
vow
i
never
loved
but
half
till
now
she
turns
her
face
to
the
wall
at
this
and
says
love
is
too
much
bliss
and
then
a
sudden
pulse
is
sent
about
the
sounding
firmament
in
smitings
as
of
silver
bars
the
bright
disorder
of
the
stars
is
solved
by
music
far
and
near
through
infinite
distinctions
clear
their
twofold
voices
deeper
tone
utters
the
name
which
all
things
own
and
each
ecstatic
treble
dwells
on
one
whereof
none
other
tells
and
we
sublimed
to
song
and
fire
take
order
in
the
wheeling
quire
till
from
the
throbbing
sphere
i
start
waked
by
the
heaving
of
my
heart
such
dreams
as
these
come
night
by
night
disturbing
day
with
their
delight
portend
they
nothing
who
can
tell
god
yet
may
do
some
miracle
is
nigh
two
years
and
she
not
wed
or
you
would
know
he
may
be
dead
or
mad
and
loving
some
one
else
and
she
much
moved
that
nothing
quells
my
constancy
or
simply
wroth
with
such
a
wretch
accept
my
troth
to
spite
him
or
her
beauty
gone
and
that
my
dream
and
this
man
vaughan
takes
her
release
or
tongues
malign
confusing
every
ear
but
mine
have
smirch
her
ah
move
her
sure
to
find
i
loved
her
all
the
more
nay
now
i
think
haply
amiss
i
read
her
words
and
looks
and
his
that
night
did
not
his
jealousy
show
good
my
god
and
can
it
be
that
i
a
modest
fool
all
blest
nothing
of
such
a
heaven
guess
oh
chance
too
frail
yet
frantic
sweet
sees
me
at
her
feet
yonder
at
last
the
glad
sea
roars
along
the
sacred
english
shores
there
lies
the
lovely
land
i
know
where
men
and
women
lordliest
grow
there
peep
the
roofs
where
more
than
kings
postpone
state
cares
to
country
things
and
many
a
gay
queen
simply
tends
the
babes
on
whom
the
world
depends
there
curls
the
wanton
cottage
smoke
of
him
that
drives
but
bears
no
yoke
there
laughs
the
realm
where
low
and
high
are
lieges
to
society
and
life
has
all
too
wide
a
scope
too
free
a
prospect
for
its
hope
for
any
private
good
or
ill
except
dishonour
quite
to
fill
mother
since
this
was
penn
i
read
that
vaughan
on
tuesday
wed
the
beautiful
miss
churchill
so
that
over
and
i
go
to
take
up
my
new
post
on
board
the
wolf
my
peace
at
last
restored
my
lonely
faith
like
grief
is
now
the
cloak
i
clasp
about
me
to
prevent
the
deadly
chill
of
a
content
with
any
near
or
distant
good
except
the
exact
beatitude
which
love
has
shown
to
my
desire
talk
not
of
joys
and
higher
i
hate
and
disavow
all
bliss
as
none
for
me

this

not
i
blasphemously
cope
with
god
decrees
and
cast
off

how
when
and
where
can
mine
succeed
i
trust
he
knows
who
made
my
need
baseness
of
men
pursuit
being
doubtless
her
husband
feels
no
more
the
heaven
of
heavens
of
such
a
bride
but
lounging
lets
her
please
his
pride
with
fondness
guerdons
her
caress
with
little
names
and
turns
a
tress
round
idle
fingers
if
is
so
why
then
i
happier
of
the
two
better
for
lofty
loss
high
pain
than
low
content
with
lofty
gain
poor
foolish
dove
to
trust
from
me
her
happiness
and
dignity
x
from
frederick
i
thought
the
worst
had
brought
me
balm
but
the
tempest
central
calm
vague
sinkings
of
the
heart
aver
that
dreadful
wrong
is
come
to
her
and
this
dream
i
brood
and
dote
and
learn
its
agonies
by
rote
as
if
i
loved
it
early
and
late
i
make
familiar
with
my
fate
and
feed
with
fascinated
will
on
very
dregs
of
finish
ill
i
think
she
near
him
now
alone
with
wardship
and
protection
none
alone
perhaps
in
the
hindering
stress
of
airs
that
clasp
him
with
her
dress
they
wander
whispering
by
the
wave
and
haply
now
in
some
where
the
ribb
sand
is
rarely
trod
they
laugh
they
kiss
oh
god
oh
god
there
comes
a
smile
acutely
sweet
out
of
the
picturing
dark
i
meet
the
ancient
frankness
of
her
gaze
that
soft
and
blaze
of
great
goodwill
and
innocence
and
perfect
joy
proceeding
thence
ah
made
for
earth
delight
yet
such
the
air
too
gross
to
touch
at
thought
of
which
the
soul
in
me
is
as
the
bird
that
bites
a
bee
and
darts
abroad
on
frantic
wing
tasting
the
honey
and
the
sting
and
moaning
where
all
round
me
sleep
amidst
the
moaning
of
the
deep
i
start
at
midnight
from
my
bed
and
have
no
right
to
strike
him
dead
what
world
is
this
that
i
am
in
where
chance
turns
sanctity
to
sin
is
crime
henceforward
to
desire
the
only
good
the
sacred
fire
that
sunn
the
universe
is
hell
i
hear
a
voice
which
argues
well
heaven
hard
has
scorn
your
cry
fall
down
and
worship
me
and
i
will
give
you
peace
go
and
profane
this
pangful
love
so
pure
so
vain
and
thereby
win
forgetfulness
and
pardon
of
the
spirit
excess
which
soar
too
nigh
that
jealous
heaven
ever
save
thus
to
be
forgiven
no
gospel
has
come
down
that
cures
with
better
gain
a
loss
like
yours
be
pious
give
the
beggar
pelf
and
love
your
neighbour
as
yourself
you
who
yet
love
though
all
is
and
she
be
your
neighbour
more
with
soul
which
can
in
pity
smile
that
aught
with
such
a
measure
vile
as
self
should
be
at
all
named
love
your
sanctity
the
priests
reprove
your
case
of
grief
they
wholly
miss
the
man
of
sorrows
names
not
this
the
years
they
say
graft
love
divine
on
the
lopp
stock
of
love
like
thine
the
wild
tree
dies
not
but
converts
so
be
it
but
the
lopping
hurts
the
graft
takes
tardily
men
stanch
meantime
with
earth
the
bleeding
branch
there
nothing
heals
one
woman
loss
and
lightens
life
eternal
cross
with
intermission
of
sound
rest
like
lying
in
another
breast
the
cure
is
to
your
thinking
low
is
not
life
all
henceforward
so
ill
voice
at
least
thou
my
mood
i
sleep
but
as
i
thus
conclude
the
intrusions
of
her
grace
dispel
the
comfortable
glooms
of
hell
a
wonder
ere
these
lines
were
dried
vaughan
and
my
love
his
bride
became
my
guests
i
look
and
lo
in
beauty
soft
as
is
the
snow
and
powerful
as
the
avalanche
she
lit
the
deck
the
chance
she
smiled
surprised
they
came
to
see
the
ship
not
thinking
to
meet
me
at
infinite
distance
she
my
day
what
then
to
him
howbeit
they
say
not
so
sunny
in
the
sun
but
men
might
live
cool
lives
thereon
all
well
for
i
have
seen
arise
that
reflex
sweetness
of
her
eyes
in
his
and
watch
his
breath
defer
humbly
its
bated
life
to
her
his
my
love
she
safe
in
his
devotion
what
ask
i
but
this
they
bade
adieu
i
saw
them
go
across
the
sea
and
now
i
know
the
ultimate
hope
i
rested
on
the
hope
beyond
the
grave
is
gone
the
hope
that
in
the
heavens
high
at
last
it
should
appear
that
i
loved
most
and
so
by
claim
divine
should
have
her
in
the
heavens
for
mine
according
to
such
nuptial
sort
as
may
subsist
in
the
holy
court
where
if
there
are
all
kinds
of
joys
to
exhaust
the
multitude
of
choice
in
many
mansions
then
there
are
loves
personal
and
particular
conspicuous
in
the
glorious
sky
of
universal
charity
as
phosphor
in
the
sunrise
now
i
seen
them
i
believe
their
vow
immortal
and
the
dreadful
thought
that
he
less
honour
than
he
ought
her
sanctity
is
laid
to
rest
and
blessing
them
i
too
am
blest
my
goodwill
as
a
springing
air
unclouds
a
beauty
in
despair
i
stand
beneath
the
sky
pure
cope
unburthen
even
by
a
hope
and
peace
unspeakable
a
joy
which
hope
would
deaden
and
destroy
like
sunshine
fills
the
airy
gulf
left
by
the
vanishing
of
self
that
i
have
known
her
that
she
moves
somewhere
that
she
loves
and
is
belov
and
that
she
so
most
happy
and
to
heaven
will
go
where
i
may
meet
with
her
yet
this
i
count
but
accidental
bliss
and
that
the
full
celestial
weal
of
all
shall
sensitively
feel
the
partnership
and
work
of
each
and
thus
my
love
and
labour
reach
her
region
there
the
more
to
bless
her
last
consummate
happiness
is
guerdon
up
to
the
degree
of
that
alone
true
loyalty
which
sacrificing
is
not
nice
about
the
terms
of
sacrifice
but
offers
all
with
smiles
that
say
little
but
it
is
for
aye
xi
from
graham
you
wanted
her
my
son
for
wife
with
the
fierce
need
of
life
in
life
that
nobler
passion
of
an
hour
was
rather
prophecy
than
power
and
nature
from
such
stress
unbent
recurs
to
deep
discouragement
trust
not
such
peace
yet
easy
breath
in
hot
diseases
argues
death
and
tastelessness
within
the
mouth
worse
fever
shows
than
heat
or
drouth
wherefore
take
frederick
timely
fear
against
a
different
danger
near
wed
not
one
woman
oh
my
child
because
another
has
not
smiled
oft
with
a
disappointed
man
the
first
who
cares
to
win
him
can
for
after
love
heroic
strain
which
tired
the
heart
and
brought
no
gain
he
feels
consoled
relieved
and
eased
to
meet
with
her
who
can
be
pleased
to
proffer
kindness
amid
compute
his
acquiescence
for
pursuit
who
troubles
not
his
lonely
mood
and
asks
for
love
mere
gratitude
ah
desperate
folly
yet
we
know
who
wed
through
love
wed
mostly
so
at
least
my
son
when
wed
you
do
see
that
the
woman
equals
you
nor
rush
from
having
loved
too
high
into
a
worse
humility
a
poor
estate
a
foolish
plea
for
marrying
to
a
base
degree
a
woman
grown
can
not
be
train
or
if
she
could
no
love
were
gain
for
never
was
a
man
heart
caught
by
graces
he
himself
had
taught
and
fancy
not
is
in
the
might
of
man
to
do
without
delight
for
should
you
in
her
nothing
find
to
exhilarate
the
higher
mind
your
soul
would
deaden
useless
wings
with
wickedness
of
lawful
things
and
vampire
pleasure
swift
destroy
even
the
memory
of
joy
so
let
no
man
in
desperate
mood
wed
a
dull
girl
because
she
good
all
virtues
in
his
wife
soon
dim
except
the
power
of
pleasing
him
which
may
small
virtue
be
or
none
i
know
my
just
and
tender
son
to
whom
the
dangerous
grace
is
given
that
scorns
a
good
which
is
not
heaven
my
child
who
used
to
sit
and
sigh
under
the
bright
ideal
sky
and
pass
to
spare
the
farmer
wheat
the
poppy
and
the
he
would
not
let
his
wife
heart
ache
for
what
was
mainly
his
mistake
but
having
err
so
all
his
force
would
fix
upon
the
hard
right
course
she
graceless
say
yet
good
and
true
and
therefore
inly
fair
and
through
the
veils
which
inward
beauty
fold
faith
can
her
loveliness
behold
ah
that
soon
tired
faith
falls
away
without
the
ceremonial
stay
of
outward
loveliness
and
awe
the
weightier
matters
of
the
law
she
pays
mere
mint
and
cumin
not
and
in
the
road
that
she
was
taught
she
treads
and
takes
for
granted
still
nature
immedicable
ill
so
never
wears
within
her
eyes
a
false
report
of
paradise
nor
ever
modulates
her
mirth
with
vain
compassion
of
the
earth
which
made
a
certain
happier
face
affecting
and
a
gayer
grace
with
pathos
delicately
edged
yet
though
she
be
not
privileged
to
unlock
for
you
your
heart
delight
her
keys
being
gold
but
not
the
right
on
lower
levels
she
may
do
her
joy
is
more
in
loving
you
than
being
loved
and
she
commands
all
tenderness
she
understands
it
is
but
when
you
proffer
more
the
yoke
weighs
heavy
and
chafes
sore
it
weary
work
enforcing
love
on
one
who
has
enough
thereof
and
honour
on
the
lowlihead
of
ignorance
besides
you
dread
in
leah
arms
to
meet
the
eyes
of
rachel
somewhere
in
the
skies
and
both
return
alike
relieved
to
life
less
loftily
conceived
alas
alas
then
wait
the
mood
in
which
a
woman
may
be
whose
thoughts
and
habits
are
too
high
for
honour
to
be
flattery
and
who
would
surely
not
allow
the
suit
that
you
could
proffer
now
her
equal
yoke
would
sit
with
ease
it
might
with
wearing
even
please
not
with
a
better
word
to
move
the
loyal
wrath
of
present
love
she
would
not
mope
when
you
were
gay
for
want
of
knowing
aught
to
say
nor
vex
you
with
unhandsome
waste
of
thoughts
and
words
nor
reckon
small
things
duties
small
and
your
fine
sense
fantastical
nor
would
she
bring
you
up
a
brood
of
strangers
bound
to
you
by
blood
boys
of
a
meaner
moral
race
girls
with
their
mother
evil
grace
but
not
her
chance
to
sometimes
find
her
critic
past
his
judgment
kind
nor
unaccustom
to
respect
which
men
where
is
not
claim
neglect
confirm
you
selfish
and
morose
and
slowly
by
contagion
gross
but
glad
and
able
to
receive
the
honour
you
would
long
to
give
would
hasten
on
to
justify
expectancy
however
high
whilst
you
would
happily
incur
compulsion
to
keep
up
with
her
xii
from
frederick
your
letter
mother
bears
the
date
of
six
months
back
and
comes
too
late
my
love
past
all
conceiving
lost
a
change
seem
good
at
any
cost
from
lonely
stupid
silent
grief
vain
objectless
beyond
relief
and
like
a
settled
dense
on
fancy
feeling
thought
and
sense
i
grew
so
idle
so
despised
myself
my
powers
by
her
unprized
honouring
my
post
but
nothing
more
and
lying
when
i
lived
on
shore
so
late
of
mornings
weak
tears
for
such
slight
came
if
only
gleam
remotely
beautifully
bright
on
clouded
eves
at
sea
the
light
of
english
headlands
in
the
sun
that
soon
i
deem
better
done
to
lay
this
poor
complaining
wraith
of
unreciprocated
faith
and
so
with
heart
still
bleeding
quick
but
strengthen
by
the
comfort
sick
of
knowing
that
could
not
care
i
turn
away
from
my
despair
and
told
our
chaplain
daughter
jane
a
dear
good
girl
who
saw
my
pain
and
look
as
if
she
pitied
me
how
glad
and
thankful
i
should
be
if
some
kind
woman
not
above
myself
in
rank
would
give
her
love
to
one
that
knew
not
how
to
woo
whereat
she
without
more
ado
blush
spoke
of
love
return
and
closed
with
what
i
meant
to
have
proposed
and
trust
me
mother
i
and
jane
we
suit
each
other
well
my
gain
is
very
great
in
this
good
wife
to
whom
i
bound
for
natural
life
by
hearty
faith
yet
crossing
not
my
faith
towards
i
know
not
what
as
to
the
ether
is
the
air
is
her
good
to
honoria
fair
one
place
is
full
of
both
yet
each
lies
quite
beyond
the
other
reach
and
recognition
if
you
say
am
i
contented
yea
and
nay
for
what
base
but
content
to
grow
with
less
good
than
the
best
we
know
but
think
me
not
from
life
withdrawn
by
passion
for
a
hope
that
gone
so
far
as
to
forget
how
much
a
woman
is
as
merely
such
to
man
affection
what
is
best
in
each
belongs
to
all
the
rest
and
though
in
marriage
quite
to
kiss
and
half
to
love
the
custom
is
such
dishonour
ruin
bare
the
soul
interior
despair
and
life
between
two
troubles
toss
to
me
who
think
not
with
the
most
whatever
have
been
before
my
cousin
time
is
now
so
sore
a
treason
to
the
abiding
throne
of
that
sweet
love
which
i
have
known
i
can
not
live
so
and
i
bend
my
mind
perforce
to
comprehend
that
he
who
gives
command
to
love
does
not
require
a
thing
above
the
strength
he
gives
the
highest
degree
of
the
hardest
grace
humility
the
step
heaven
the
latest
trod
and
that
which
makes
us
most
like
god
and
us
much
more
than
god
behoves
is
to
be
humble
in
our
loves
henceforth
for
ever
therefore
i
renounce
all
partiality
of
passion
subject
to
control
of
that
perspective
of
the
soul
which
god
himself
pronounces
good
confirming
claims
of
neighbourhood
and
giving
man
for
earthly
life
the
closest
neighbour
in
a
wife
i
serve
all
jane
be
munch
more
dear
than
all
as
she
is
much
more
near
i
love
her
yea
and
love
joy
comes
ever
from
martyrdoms
yet
not
to
lie
for
god
is
true
that
was
another
joy
i
knew
when
freighted
was
my
heart
with
fire
of
fond
irrational
desire
for
fascinating
female
charms
and
hopeless
heaven
in
her
mild
arms
nor
wrong
i
any
if
i
profess
that
care
for
heaven
with
me
were
less
but
that
i
utterly
imbued
with
faith
of
all
earth
hope
in
realms
where
no
pains
expectance
and
dear
love
disdains
time
treason
and
the
gathering
dross
and
lasts
for
ever
in
the
gloss
of
newness
all
the
bright
past
seems
now
but
a
splendour
in
my
dreams
which
shows
albeit
the
dreamer
wakes
the
standard
of
right
life
life
aches
to
be
therewith
conform
but
oh
the
world
so
stolid
dark
and
low
that
and
the
mortal
element
forbid
the
beautiful
intent
and
like
the
unborn
butterfly
it
feels
the
wings
and
wants
the
sky
but
perilous
is
the
lofty
mood
which
can
not
yoke
with
lowly
good
right
life
for
me
is
life
that
wends
by
lowly
ways
to
lofty
ends
i
will
perceive
at
length
that
haste
heaven
itself
is
only
waste
and
thus
i
dread
the
impatient
spur
of
aught
that
speaks
too
plain
of
her
there
little
here
that
story
tells
but
music
talks
of
nothing
else
therefore
when
music
breathes
i
say
and
urge
my
task
away
away
thou
art
the
voice
of
one
i
knew
but
what
thou
is
not
yet
true
thou
art
the
voice
of
her
i
loved
and
i
would
not
be
vainly
moved
so
that
which
did
from
death
set
free
all
things
now
dons
death
mockery
and
takes
its
place
with
tunings
that
are
but
little
noted
do
not
mar
for
me
your
peace
my
health
is
high
the
proud
possession
of
mine
eye
departed
i
am
much
like
one
who
had
by
haughty
custom
grown
to
think
gilt
rooms
and
spacious
grounds
horses
and
carriages
and
hounds
fine
linen
and
an
eider
bed
as
much
his
need
as
daily
bread
and
honour
of
men
as
much
or
more
till
strange
misfortune
smiting
sore
his
pride
all
goes
to
pay
his
debts
a
lodging
anywhere
he
gets
and
takes
his
family
thereto
weeping

allow
by

grace

with

there

that
left
jane
is
not
fair
yet
pleases
well
the
eye
in
which
no
others
dwell
and
features
somewhat
plainly
set
and
homely
manners
leave
her
yet
the
crowning
boon
and
most
express
of
heaven
inventive
tenderness
a
woman
but
i
do
her
wrong
letting
the
world
eyes
guide
my
tongue
she
has
a
handsomeness
that
pays
no
homage
to
the
hourly
gaze
and
dwells
not
on
the
arch
brow
height
and
lids
which
softly
lodge
the
light
nor
in
the
pure
field
of
the
cheek
though
the
soul
be
still
to
seek
but
shows
as
fits
that
solemn
place
whereof
the
window
is
the
face
blankness
and
leaden
outlines
mark
what
time
the
church
within
is
dark
yet
view
it
on
a
festal
night
or
some
occasion
else
for
light
and
each
ungainly
line
is
seen
a
special
character
to
mean
of
saint
or
prophet
and
the
whole
blank
window
is
a
living
scroll
for
hours
the
clock
upon
the
shelf
has
all
the
talking
to
itself
but
to
and
fro
her
needle
runs
twice
while
the
clock
is
ticking
once
and
when
a
wife
is
well
in
reach
not
silence
separates
but
speech
and
i
contented
read
or
smoke
and
idly
think
or
idly
stroke
the
winking
cat
or
watch
the
fire
in
social
peace
that
does
not
tire
until
at
easeful
end
of
day
she
moves
and
puts
her
work
away
and
saying
cold
is
or
warm
or
something
else
as
little
harm
comes
used
to
finding
kindly
press
a
woman
welcome
to
my
breast
with
all
the
great
advantage
clear
of
none
else
having
been
so
near
but
sometimes
how
shall
i
deny
there
falls
with
her
thus
fondly
by
dejection
and
a
chilling
shade
remember
pleasures
as
they
fade
salute
me
and
colossal
grow
like
in
the
thawing
snow
i
feel
oppress
beyond
my
force
with
foolish
envy
and
remorse
i
love
this
woman
but
i
might
have
loved
some
else
with
more
delight
and
strange
it
seems
of
god
that
he
should
make
a
vain
capacity
such
times
of
ignorant
relapse
well
she
does
not
talk
perhaps
the
dream
the
discontent
the
doubt
to
some
injustice
flaming
out
else
might
leave
us
both
to
moan
a
kind
tradition
overthrown
and
dawning
promise
once
more
dead
in
the
pernicious
lowlihead
of
not
aspiring
to
be
fair
and
what
am
i
that
i
should
dare
dispute
with
god
who
moulds
one
clay
to
honour
and
shame
and
wills
to
pay
with
equal
wages
them
that
delve

xiii
from
lady
clitheroe
to
mary
churchill
i
dreadful
news
my
sister
dear
frederick
has
married
as
we
hear
oh
a
girl
this
fact
we
get
from
barton
whom
we
met
at
abury
once
he
used
to
know
at
race
and
hunt
lord
clitheroe
and
writes
that
he
seen
fred
graham
commander
of
the
wolf
the
same
the
mess
call
joseph
with
his
wife
under
his
arm
he
his
life
the
fellow
married
her
for
love
for
there
was
nothing
else
to
move
h
is
her
shibboleth
is
said
her
mother
was
a
poor
fred
what
honoria
say
she
thought
so
highly
of
him
pray
tell
it
her
gently
i
no
right
i
know
you
hold
to
trust
my
sight
but
frederick
state
could
not
be
hid
awl
felix
coming
when
he
did
was
lucky
for
honoria
too
was
half
in
love
how
warm
she
grew
on
when
once
i
said
i
fancied
that
in
ladies
fred
had
tastes
much
better
than
his
means
his
hand
was
worthy
of
a
queen
said
she
and
actually
shed
tears
the
night
he
left
us
for
two
years
and
sobb
when
ask
the
cause
to
tell
that
look
so
miserable
he
look
very
dull
no
doubt
but
such
things
girls
do
cry
about
what
weathercocks
men
always
prove
you
quite
right
not
to
fall
in
love
never
did
and
truth
to
tell
i
do
think
it
respectable
the
man
ca
understand
it
too
he
likes
to
be
in
love
with
you
but
scarce
knows
how
if
you
love
him
poor
fellow
when
is
woman
whim
to
serve
her
husband
night
and
day
the
kind
soul
lets
her
have
her
way
so
if
you
wed
as
soon
you
should
be
selfish
for
your
husband
good
happy
the
men
who
relegate
their
pleasures
vanities
and
state
to
their
nature
seems
to
be
to
enjoy
themselves
by
deputy
for
seeking
their
own
benefit
dear
what
a
mess
they
make
of
it
a
man
will
work
his
bones
away
if
but
his
wife
will
only
play
he
does
not
mind
how
much
he
teased
so
that
his
plague
looks
always
pleased
and
never
thanks
her
while
he
lives
for
anything
but
what
he
gives
is
hard
to
manage
men
we
hear
believe
me
nothing
easier
dear
the
most
important
step
by
far
is
finding
what
their
colours
are
the
next
is
not
to
let
them
know
the
reason
why
they
love
us
so
the
indolent
droop
of
a
blue
shawl
or
gray
silk
fluctuating
fall
covers
the
multitude
of
sins
in
me
husband
love
might
wince
at
azure
and
be
wild
at
slate
and
yet
do
well
with
chocolate
of
course
you
let
him
fancy
he
adored
you
for
your
piety
xiv
from
jane
to
her
mother
dear
mother
as
you
write
i
see
how
glad
and
thankful
i
should
be
for
such
a
husband
yet
to
tell
the
truth
i
am
so
miserable
how
could
he
i
remember
though
he
never
said
me
loved
me
no
he
is
so
right
that
all
seems
wrong
i
done
and
thought
my
whole
life
long
i
grown
so
dull
and
dead
with
fear
that
yes
and
no
when
he
is
near
is
all
i
have
to
say
he
quite
unlike
what
most
would
call
polite
and
yet
when
first
i
saw
him
come
to
tea
in
aunt
fine
he
made
me
feel
so
common
oh
how
dreadful
if
he
thinks
me
so
it
no
use
trying
to
behave
to
him
his
eye
so
kind
and
grave
sees
through
and
through
me
could
not
you
without
his
knowing
that
i
knew
ask
him
to
scold
me
now
and
then
mother
it
such
a
weary
strain
the
way
he
has
of
treating
me
as
if
was
something
fine
to
be
a
woman
and
appearing
not
to
notice
any
faults
i
got
i
know
he
knows
i
plain
and
small
stupid
and
ignorant
and
all
awkward
and
mean
and
by
degrees
i
see
a
beauty
which
he
sees
when
often
he
looks
strange
awhile
then
recollects
me
with
a
smile
i
wish
he
had
that
fancied
wife
with
me
for
maid
now
all
my
life
to
dress
her
out
for
him
and
make
her
looks
the
lovelier
for
his
sake
to
have
her
rate
me
till
i
cried
then
see
her
seated
by
his
side
and
driven
off
proudly
to
the
ball
then
to
stay
up
for
her
whilst
all
the
servants
were
asleep
and
hear
at
dawn
the
carriage
rolling
near
and
let
them
in
and
hear
her
laugh
and
boast
he
said
that
none
was
half
so
beautiful
and
that
the
queen
who
danced
with
him
the
first
had
seen
and
noticed
her
and
ask
who
was
that
lady
in
the
golden
gauze
and
then
to
go
to
bed
and
lie
in
a
sort
of
heavenly
jealousy
until
was
broad
day
and
i
she
slept
nor
knew
how
she
was
bless
pray
burn
this
letter
i
would
not
complain
but
for
the
fear
i
got
of
going
wild
as
we
hear
tell
of
people
shut
up
in
a
cell
with
no
one
there
to
talk
to
he
must
never
know
he
is
loved
by
me
the
most
he
think
himself
to
blame
and
i
should
almost
die
for
shame
if
being
good
would
serve
instead
of
being
graceful
ah
then
fred
but
i
myself
i
never
could
see
what
in
women
being
good
for
all
their
goodness
is
to
do
just
what
their
nature
tells
them
to
now
when
a
man
would
do
what
right
he
has
to
try
with
all
his
might
though
true
and
kind
in
deed
and
word
fred
not
a
vessel
of
the
lord
but
i
have
hopes
of
him
for
oh
how
can
we
ever
surely
know
but
that
the
very
darkest
place
may
be
the
scene
of
saving
grace
xv
from
frederick
did
i
feel
the
little
wight
fill
me
unfatherly
with
fright
so
grim
it
gazed
and
out
of
the
sky
there
came
minute
remote
the
cry
piercing
of
original
pain
i
put
the
wonder
back
to
jane
and
her
delight
seem
dash
that
i
of
strangers
still
by
nature
shy
was
not
familiar
quite
so
soon
with
her
small
friend
of
many
a
moon
but
when
the
mother
smiled
she
seem
herself
a
little
child
dwelling
at
large
beyond
the
law
by
which
till
then
i
judged
and
saw
and
that
fond
glow
which
she
felt
stir
for
it
suffused
my
heart
for
her
to
whom
from
the
weak
babe
and
thence
to
me
an
influent
innocence
happy
reparative
of
life
came
and
she
was
indeed
my
wife
as
there
lovely
with
love
she
lay
brightly
contented
all
the
day
to
hug
her
sleepy
little
boy
in
the
reciprocated
joy
of
touch
the
childish
sense
of
love
ever
inquisitive
to
prove
its
strange
possession
and
to
know
if
the
eye
report
be
really
so
xvi
from
jane
to
graham
dear
mother
such
if
you
allow
in
not
i
call
you
now
i
hope
you
well
i
write
to
say
frederick
has
got
besides
his
pay
a
good
appointment
in
the
docks
also
to
thank
you
for
the
frocks
and
shoes
for
baby
i
shall
soon
be
strong
fred
goes
to
sea
no
more
i
so
glad
because
though
kinder
husband
never
was
he
seems
still
kinder
to
become
the
more
he
stays
with
me
at
home
when
we
are
parted
i
see
plain
he
dull
till
he
gets
used
again
to
marriage
do
not
tell
him
though
i
would
not
have
him
know
i
know
for
all
the
world
i
try
to
mind
all
your
advice
but
sometimes
find
i
do
not
well
see
how
i
thought
to
take
it
about
dress
so
bought
a
gay
new
bonnet
gown
and
shawl
but
frederick
was
not
pleased
at
all
for
though
he
smiled
and
said
smart
i
feel
you
know
what
in
his
heart
but
i
shall
learn
i
fancied
long
that
care
in
dress
was
very
wrong
till
frederick
in
his
startling
way
when
i
began
to
blame
one
day
the
admiral
wife
because
we
hear
she
spends
two
hours
or
something
near
in
dressing
took
her
part
and
said
how
all
things
deck
themselves
that
wed
how
birds
and
plants
grow
fine
to
please
each
other
in
their
marriages
and
how
which
certainly
is
true
it
never
struck
me
did
it
you
dress
was
at
first
heaven
ordinance
and
has
much
scripture
countenance
for
eliezer
we
are
told
adorn
with
jewels
and
with
gold
rebecca
in
the
psalms
again
how
the
king
daughter
dress
and
then
the
good
wife
in
the
proverbs
she
made
herself
clothes
of
tapestry
purple
and
silk
and
there
much
more
i
had
not
thought
about
before
but
fred
so
clever
do
you
know
since
baby
came
he
loves
me
so
i
really
useful
now
to
fred
and
none
could
do
so
well
instead
it
nice
to
fancy
if
i
died
he
miss
me
from
the
darling
side
also
there
something
now
you
see
on
which
we
talk
and
quite
agree
on
which
without
pride
too
i
can
hope
i
as
wise
as
any
man
i
should
be
happy
now
if
quite
sure
that
in
thing
fred
was
right
but
though
i
trust
his
prayers
are
said
because
he
goes
so
late
to
bed
i
doubt
his
calling
glad
to
find
a
text
adapted
to
his
mind
that
where
paul
in
man
and
wife
allows
a
little
worldly
life
he
smiled
and
said
that
he
knew
all
such
things
as
that
without
paul
and
once
he
said
when
i
with
pain
had
got
him
just
to
read
romaine
creeds
should
not
their
hopes
condemn
who
wait
for
heaven
to
come
to
them
are
little
like
to
go
to
heaven
if
logic
not
the
devil
leaven
i
cried
at
such
a
wicked
joke
and
he
surprised
went
out
to
smoke
but
to
judge
him
is
not
for
me
who
myself
sin
so
dreadfully
as
half
to
doubt
if
i
should
care
to
go
to
heaven
and
he
not
there
he
be
right
and
i
dare
say
i
shall
soon
understand
his
way
to
other
things
once
strange
i
grown
accustom
nay
to
like
i
own
long
before
i
got
well
used
to
sit
while
frederick
read
or
mused
for
hours
and
scarcely
spoke
when
he
for
all
that
held
the
door
to
me
pick
up
my
handkerchief
and
rose
to
set
my
chair
with
other
shows
of
honour
such
as
men
is
true
to
sweethearts
and
fine
ladies
do
it
almost
seem
an
unkind
jest
but
now
i
like
these
ways
the
best
they
somehow
make
me
gentle
and
good
and
i
do
mind
his
quiet
mood
if
frederick
seem
dull
awhile
there
baby
you
should
see
him
smile
i
pretty
and
nice
to
him
sweet
pet
and
he
will
learn
no
better
yet
indeed
now
little
johnny
makes
a
busier
time
of
it
and
takes
our
thoughts
off
one
another
more
in
happy
as
need
be
i
sure
xvii
from
felix
to
honoria
let
me
beloved
while
gratitude
is
garrulous
with
coming
good
or
ere
the
tongue
of
happiness
be
silenced
by
your
soft
caress
relate
how
musing
here
of
you
the
clouds
the
intermediate
blue
the
air
that
rings
with
larks
the
grave
and
distant
rumour
of
the
wave
the
solitary
sailing
skiff
the
gusty
on
the
cliff
the
by
the
crumbling
ledge
or
at
the
shingle
edge
the
sighing
sea
recurrent
crest
breaking
resign
to
its
unrest
all
whisper
to
my
thought
of
charms
in
you
till
now
uncaught
or
only
caught
as
dreams
to
die
ere
they
were
own
by
memory
high
and
ingenious
decree
of
deity
you
whose
ambition
only
is
the
assurance
that
you
make
my
bliss
hence
my
first
debt
of
love
to
show
that
you
past
showing
indeed
do
so
trust
me
the
world
the
firmament
with
worlds
besprent
were
rear
in
no
mere
undivine
boast
of
omnipotent
design
the
lion
differing
from
the
snake
but
for
the
trick
of
difference
sake
and
comets
darting
to
and
fro
because
in
circles
planets
go
but
rather
that
sole
love
might
be
refresh
throughout
eternity
in
one
sweet
faith
for
ever
strange
mirror
by
circumstantial
change
for
more
and
more
do
i
perceive
that
everything
is
relative
to
you
and
that
there
not
a
star
nor
nothing
i
so
strange
or
far
but
if
scanned
chiefly
mean
somewhat
till
then
in
you
unseen
something
to
make
the
bondage
strait
of
you
and
me
more
intimate
some
unguess
opportunity
of
nuptials
in
a
new
degree
but
oh
with
what
a
novel
force
your
beauties
by
remorse
of
absence
touch
and
in
my
heart
how
bleeds
afresh
the
youthful
smart
of
passion
fond
despairing
still
to
utter
infinite
goodwill
by
worthy
service
yet
i
know
that
love
is
all
that
love
can
owe
and
this
to
offer
is
no
less
of
worth
in
kind
speech
or
caress
than
if
my
i
should
give
for
good
is
god
prerogative
and
love
deed
is
but
to
prepare
the
flatter
dear
belov
to
dare
acceptance
of
his
gifts
when
first
on
me
your
happy
beauty
burst
honoria
verily
it
that
naught
beyond
you
could
be
of
beauty
and
of
heaven
delight
zeal
of
an
unknown
infinite
yet
bade
me
ever
wish
you
more
beatified
than
before
angelical
were
your
replies
to
my
prophetic
flatteries
and
sweet
was
the
compulsion
strong
that
drew
me
in
the
course
along
of
heaven
increasing
bright
allure
with
provocations
fresh
of
your
victorious
capacity
whither
may
love
so
fledged
not
fly
did
not
mere
earth
hold
fast
the
string
of
this
celestial
soaring
thing
so
measure
and
make
sensitive
and
still
to
the
nerves
nice
notice
give
of
each
minutest
increment
of
such
interminable
ascent
the
heart
would
lose
all
count
and
beat
unconscious
of
a
height
so
sweet
and
the
senses
strain
their
steps
on
the
starry
track
in
vain
but
reading
now
the
note
just
come
with
news
of
you
the
babes
and
home
i
think
and
say
eve
with
kisses
me
will
she
receive
and
thinking
for
extreme
delight
of
love
extremes
i
laugh
outright
xviii
from
frederick
eight
gone
by
and
none
yet
kept
to
keep
them
all
in
one
jane
and
myself
with
john
and
grace
on
donkeys
visited
the
place
i
first
drew
breath
in
knatchley
wood
bearing
the
basket
stuff
with
food
milk
loaves
hard
eggs
and
marmalade
i
halted
where
the
wandering
glade
divides
the
thicket
there
i
knew
it
seem
the
very
drops
of
dew
below
the
unalter
eglantine
nothing
had
changed
since
i
was
nine
in
the
green
desert
down
to
eat
we
sat
our
rustic
grace
at
meat
good
appetite
through
that
long
climb
hungry
two
hours
before
the
time
and
there
jane
took
her
stitching
out
and
john
for
pry
about
and
grace
and
baby
in
between
the
warm
blades
of
the
breathing
green
dodged
grasshoppers
and
i
no
less
in
conscientious
idleness
enjoy
myself
under
the
noon
stretch
and
the
sounds
and
sights
of
june
receiving
with
a
drowsy
charm
through
muffled
ear
and
folded
arm
and
then
as
if
i
sweetly
dream
i
how
it
when
i
too
was
a
little
child
about
the
wild
wood
roving
wild
pure
breezes
from
the
height
melted
the
blindness
from
my
sight
until
with
rapture
grief
and
awe
i
saw
again
as
then
i
saw
as
then
i
saw
i
saw
again
the
in
the
lane
with
tokens
of
its
pride
left
in
the
elms
on
either
side
the
daisies
coming
out
at
dawn
in
constellations
on
the
lawn
the
glory
of
the
daffodil
the
three
black
windmills
on
the
hill
whose
magic
arms
flung
wildly
by
sent
magic
shadows
the
rye
within
the
leafy
coppice
lo
more
wealth
than
miser
dreams
could
show
the
blackbird
warm
and
woolly
brood
five
golden
beaks
agape
for
food
the
gipsies
all
the
summer
seen
native
as
poppies
to
the
green
the
winter
with
its
frosts
and
thaws
and
opulence
of
hips
and
haws
the
lovely
marvel
of
the
snow
the
tamar
with
its
altering
show
of
gay
ships
sailing
up
and
down
among
the
fields
and
by
the
town
and
dearer
far
than
anything
came
back
the
songs
you
used
to
sing
ah
might
you
sing
such
songs
again
and
i
your
child
but
hear
as
then
with
conscious
profit
of
the
gulf
flown
over
from
my
present
self
and
as
to
men
retreating
eyes
beyond
high
mountains
higher
rise
still
farther
back
there
shone
to
me
the
dazzling
dusk
of
infancy
thither
i
look
as
sick
of
night
the
alpine
shepherd
looks
to
the
height
and
does
not
see
the
day
is
true
but
sees
the
rosy
tops
that
do
meantime
jane
stitch
and
fann
the
flies
from
my
repose
with
hush
replies
to
grace
and
smiles
when
baby
fell
her
countenance
love
visible
appear
love
audible
her
voice
why
in
the
past
alone
rejoice
whilst
here
was
wealth
before
me
cast
which
i
could
feel
if
but
past
were
then
most
precious
question
vain
when
ask
again
and
yet
again
year
after
year
yet
now
for
no
cause
but
that
heaven
bright
winds
will
blow
not
at
our
but
as
they
list
it
brought
that
distant
golden
mist
to
grace
the
hour
firing
the
deep
of
spirit
and
the
drowsy
keep
of
joy
till
spreading
uncontain
the
holy
power
of
seeing
gained
the
outward
eye
this
owning
even
that
where
there
love
and
truth
there
heaven
debtor
to
few
forgotten
hours
am
i
that
truths
for
me
are
powers
ah
happy
hours
is
something
yet
not
to
forget
that
i
forget
and
now
a
cloud
bright
huge
and
calm
rose
doubtful
if
for
bale
or
balm
towers
and
bulwarks
bright
appear
at
beck
of
viewless
might
along
a
rifted
mountain
range
untraceable
and
swift
in
change
those
glittering
peaks
disrupted
spread
to
solemn
bulks
seen
overhead
the
sunshine
quench
from
one
dark
form
fumed
the
appalling
light
of
storm
straight
to
the
zenith
black
with
bale
the
gipsies
smoke
rose
deadly
pale
and
one
wide
night
of
hopeless
hue
hid
from
the
heart
the
recent
blue
and
soon
with
thunder
crackling
loud
a
flash
reveal
the
formless
cloud
lone
sailing
rack
far
wavering
rim
and
billowy
tracts
of
stormland
dim
we
stood
safe
group
beneath
a
shed
grace
hid
behind
jane
gown
for
dread
who
told
her
fondling
with
her
hair
naughty
noise
but
god
took
care
of
all
good
girls
john
seem
to
me
too
much
for
jane
theology
who
bade
him
watch
the
tempest
now
a
blast
made
all
the
woodland
bow
against
the
whirl
of
leaves
and
dust
kine
dropp
their
heads
the
tortured
gust
jagg
and
convuls
the
ascending
smoke
to
mockery
of
the
lightning
stroke
the
blood
prick
and
a
blinding
flash
and
close
coinstantaneous
crash
humbled
the
soul
and
the
rain
all
round
resilient

the
whistling
ground
nor
flagg
in

from

sudden
as
it
came

leaving
a
trouble
in
the
copse
of
brawling
birds
and
tinkling
drops
change
beyond

far
thunder
faint

its
vast
and
vain

with
squadrons
bright
of
cloudlets
glittering
calm
and

through
gulfs
of
calm
and

with
this
adventure
we
return
the
roads

no

perchance
by
the
soft
evening
sad
advance
as
we
were
stroked
the
flanks
and
head
of
the
ass
and
somewhat
said
to
wop
the
donkeys
so
the
but
they
wo
go
without
my
wife
by
this
impress
as
men
judge
poets
by
their

when
now
we
reach

gave

xix
from
jane
dear
graham
the
fever
past
and
fred
is
well
i
in
my
last
forgot
to
say
that
while
was
on
a
lady
call
honoria
vaughan
one
of
his
salisbury
cousins
came
had
i
she
ask
me
heard
her
name
was
that
honoria
no
doubt
whom
he
would
sometimes
talk
about
and
speak
to
when
his
nights
were
bad
and
so
i
told
her
that
i
had
she
look
so
beautiful
and
kind
and
just
the
sort
of
wife
my
mind
pictured
for
fred
with
many
tears
in
those
sad
early
married
years
visiting
yesterday
she
said
the
admiral
wife
she
learn
that
fred
was
very
ill
she
begg
to
be
if
possible
of
use
to
me
what
could
she
do
last
year
his
aunt
died
leaving
her
who
had
no
want
her
fortune
half
was
his
she
thought
but
he
she
knew
would
not
be
brought
to
take
his
rights
at
second
hand
yet
something
might
she
hoped
be
plann
what
did
i
think
of
putting
john
to
school
and
college
vaughan
when
john
was
old
enough
could
give
preferment
to
her
relative
and
she
should
be
i
said
i
felt
quite
sure
that
dearest
fred
would
be
most
thankful
would
we
come
and
make
ourselves
she
ask
at
home
next
month
at
change
of
air
both
he
and
i
should
need
and
there
at
leisure
we
could
talk
and
then
fix
plans
as
john
was
nearly
ten
it
seemed
so
rude
to
think
and
doubt
so
i
said
yes
in
going
out
she
said
strange
of
frederick
dear
i
wish
he
had
been
there
to
hear
send
no
cards
or
tell
me
what
a
nice
new
cousin
i
had
got
was
not
that
kind
when
fred
grew
strong
i
had
i
found
done
very
wrong
anger
was
in
his
voice
and
eye
with
people
born
and
bred
so
high
as
fred
and
vaughan
and
you
it
hard
to
guess
what
right
to
do
and
he
wo
teach
me
dear
fred
wrote
directly
such
a
lovely
note
which
though
it
undid
all
i
had
done
was
both
to
me
and
vaughan
so
kind
his
words
i
ca
say
why
like
soldiers
music
made
me
cry
book
ii
i
from
jane
to
her
mother
thank
heaven
the
burthens
on
the
heart
are
not
half
known
till
they
depart
although
i
long
for
many
a
year
to
love
with
love
that
casts
out
fear
my
frederick
kindness
frighten
me
and
heaven
seem
less
far
off
than
he
and
in
my
fancy
i
would
trace
a
lady
with
an
angel
face
that
made
devotion
simply
debt
till
sick
with
envy
and
regret
and
wicked
grief
that
god
should
make
women
and
not
make
them
fair
that
me
might
love
me
more
because
another
in
his
memory
was
and
that
my
indigence
might
be
to
him
what
baby
was
to
me
the
chief
of
charms
who
could
have
thought
but
god
wise
way
is
to
give
nought
till
we
with
asking
it
are
tired
and
when
indeed
the
change
desired
comes
lest
we
give
ourselves
the
praise
it
comes
by
providence
not
grace
and
mostly
our
thanks
for
granted
are
groans
at
unexpected
cares
first
baby
went
to
heaven
you
know
and
five
weeks
after
grace
went
too
then
he
became
more
talkative
and
stooping
to
my
heart
would
give
signs
of
his
love
which
pleased
me
more
than
all
the
proofs
he
gave
before
and
in
that
time
of
our
great
grief
we
talk
religion
for
relief
for
though
we
very
seldom
name
religion
we
now
think
the
same
oh
what
a
bar
is
thus
removed
to
loving
and
to
being
loved
for
no
agreement
really
is
in
anything
when
none
in
this
why
mother
once
if
frederick
his
wife
against
his
hearty
breast
the
interior
difference
seem
to
tear
my
own
until
i
could
not
bear
the
trouble
was
a
dreadful
strife
and
show
indeed
that
faith
is
life
he
never
felt
this
if
he
did
i
sure
it
could
not
have
been
hid
for
wives
i
need
not
say
to
you
can
feel
just
what
their
husbands
do
without
a
word
or
look
but
then
it
is
not
so
you
know
with
men
from
that
time
many
a
scripture
text
help
me
which
had
before
perplex
oh
what
a
word
seem
this
he
is
my
head
as
christ
is
his
none
ever
could
have
dared
to
see
in
marriage
such
a
dignity
for
man
and
for
his
wife
still
less
such
happy
happy
lowliness
had
god
himself
not
made
it
plain
this
revelation
lays
the
rein
if
i
may
speak
so
on
the
neck
of
a
wife
love
takes
thence
the
check
of
conscience
and
forbids
to
doubt
its
measure
is
to
be
without
all
measure
and
a
fond
excess
is
here
her
rule
of
godliness
i
took
him
not
for
love
but
fright
he
did
but
ask
a
dreadful
right
in
this
was
love
that
he
loved
me
the
first
who
was
mere
poverty
all
that
i
know
of
love
he
taught
and
love
is
all
i
know
of
aught
my
merit
is
so
small
by
his
that
my
demerit
is
my
bliss
my
life
is
hid
with
him
in
christ
never
therefrom
to
be
enticed
and
in
his
strength
have
i
such
rest
as
when
the
baby
on
my
breast
finds
what
it
knows
not
how
to
seek
and
very
happy
very
weak
lies
only
knowing
all
is
well
pillow
on
kindness
palpable
ii
from
lady
clitheroe
to
mary
churchill
dear
saint
i
still
at
park
the
house
is
fill
with
folks
of
mark
honoria
suits
a
good
estate
much
better
than
i
hoped
how
fate
loads
her
with
happiness
and
pride
and
such
a
loving
lord
beside
but
between
us
sweet
everything
has
limits
and
to
build
a
wing
to
this
old
house
when
courtholm
stands
empty
upon
his
berkshire
lands
and
all
that
honor
might
be
near
papa
was
buying
love
too
dear
with
twenty
others
there
are
two
guests
here
whose
names
will
startle
you
and
frederick
graham
i
thought
he
stay
away
for
shame
he
and
his
wife
were
ask
you
know
and
would
not
come
four
years
ago
you
recollect
miss
smythe
found
out
who
she
had
been
and
all
about
her
people
at
the
and
how
the
fine
aunt
tried
to
instil
and
how
at
last
poor
jane
had
got
so
shy
and
that
when
the
dockyard
gentry
came
to
sup
she
always
had
to
be
lock
up
and
some
one
wrote
to
us
and
said
her
mother
was
a
dear
mary
you
be
charm
to
know
it
be
all
a
fib
but
oh
she
the
oddest
little
pet
on
which
my
eyes
were
ever
set
she
so
and
natural
that
when
she
first
arrived
we
all
wonder
as
when
a
robin
comes
in
through
the
window
to
eat
crumbs
at
breakfast
with
us
she
has
sense
humility
and
confidence
and
save
in
dressing
just
a
thought
gayer
in
colours
than
she
ought
she
looks
a
cross
between
gipsy
and
fairy
red
and
green
she
always
happens
to
do
well
and
yet
one
never
quite
can
tell
what
she
do
or
utter
next
lord
clitheroe
is
much
perplex
her
husband
every
now
and
then
looks
nervous
all
the
other
men
are
charm
yet
she
has
neither
grace
nor
one
good
feature
in
her
face
her
eyes
indeed
flame
in
her
head
like
very
to
fred
whose
steps
she
follows
everywhere
like
a
tame
duck
to
the
despair
of
colonel
holmes
who
does
his
part
to
break
her
funny
little
heart
honor
enchanted
is
her
view
that
people
if
they
good
and
true
and
treated
well
and
let
alone
will
kindly
take
to
what
their
own
and
always
be
original
like
children
honor
just
like
all
the
rest
of
us
but
thinking
so
well
she
miss
lord
clitheroe
who
hates
originality
though
he
puts
up
with
it
in
me
poor
graham
has
never
been
to
the
opera
you
should
have
seen
the
innocent
way
she
told
the
earl
she
thought
plays
sinful
when
a
girl
and
now
she
never
had
a
chance
frederick
complacent
smile
and
glance
towards
her
show
me
past
a
doubt
honoria
had
been
quite
cut
out
is
very
strange
for
graham
though
frederick
fancy
none
can
blame
seems
the
last
woman
you
have
thought
lover
would
have
ever
sought
she
never
reads
i
find
nor
goes
anywhere
so
that
i
suppose
she
got
at
all
she
ever
knew
by
growing
up
as
kittens
do
talking
of
kittens
you
have
more
influence
than
i
with
dear
honoria
get
her
dear
to
be
a
little
more
severe
with
those
sweet
children
they
the
run
of
all
the
place
when
school
was
done
maud
burst
in
while
the
earl
was
there
with
mama
do
be
a
bear
do
you
know
dear
this
odd
wife
of
fred
adores
his
old
love
in
his
stead
she
so
nice
yet
i
should
say
not
quite
the
thing
for
every
day
wonders
are
wearying
felix
goes
next
sunday
with
her
to
the
close
and
you
will
judge
honoria
asks
all
wiltshire
belles
here
felix
basks
like
puss
in
when
the
room
is
thus
aflame
with
female
bloom
but
then
she
smiles
when
most
would
pout
and
so
his
lawless
loves
go
out
with
the
last
brocade
is
not
the
same
i
fear
with
frederick
graham
honoria
should
not
have
her
here
and
this
you
might
just
hint
my
dear
for
felix
says
he
never
saw
such
proof
of
what
he
holds
for
law
that
is
love
which
can
be
seen
whatever
he
by
this
may
mean
were
it
not
dreadful
if
he
fell
in
love
with
her
on
principle
iii
from
jane
to
graham
mother
i
told
you
how
at
first
i
fear
this
visit
to
the
hurst
fred
must
i
felt
be
so
by
aught
in
me
unlike
the
rest
who
come
here
but
i
find
the
place
delightful
there
such
ease
and
grace
and
kindness
and
all
seem
to
be
on
such
a
high
equality
they
have
not
got
to
think
you
know
how
far
to
make
the
money
go
but
frederick
says
it
less
the
expense
of
money
than
of
sound
quickness
to
care
what
others
feel
and
thoughts
with
nothing
to
conceal
which
i
teach
johnny
vaughan
was
waiting
for
us
on
the
lawn
and
kiss
and
call
me
fred
neglected
his
old
friends
she
said
he
laugh
and
colour
up
at
this
she
was
you
know
a
flame
of
his
but
i
not
jealous
luncheon
done
i
left
him
who
had
just
begun
to
talk
about
the
russian
war
with
an
old
lady
lady
carr
a
countess
but
i
more
afraid
a
great
deal
of
the
lady
maid
and
went
with
vaughan
to
see
the
pictures
which
appear
to
be
of
sorts
of
horses
clowns
and
cows
call
wouvermans
and
cuyps
and
dows
and
then
she
took
me
up
to
show
her
bedroom
where
long
years
ago
a
queen
slept
is
all
tapestries
of
cupids
gods
and
goddesses
and
black
carved
oak
a
curtain
door
leads
thence
into
her
soft
boudoir
where
even
her
husband
may
but
come
by
favour
he
too
has
his
room
kept
sacred
to
his
solitude
did
i
not
think
the
plan
was
good
she
ask
me
but
i
said
how
small
our
house
was
and
that
after
all
though
frederick
would
not
say
his
prayers
at
night
till
i
was
safe
upstairs
i
thought
it
wrong
to
be
so
shy
of
being
good
when
i
was
by
you
should
humour
him
she
said
with
her
sweet
voice
and
smile
and
led
the
way
to
where
the
children
ate
their
dinner
and
miss
williams
sate
she
only
yet
they
consider
her
no
less
than
lord
or
lady
carr
or
me
just
think
how
happy
she
must
be
the
with
its
painted
sky
where
heavy
angels
seem
to
fly
is
a
dull
place
its
size
and
gloom
make
them
prefer
for
the
library
all
done
up
new
and
comfortable
with
a
view
of
salisbury
spire
between
the
boughs
when
she
had
shown
me
through
the
house
i
wish
i
could
have
let
her
know
that
she
herself
was
half
the
show
she
so
handsome
and
so
kind
she
fetch
the
children
who
had
dined
and
taking
one
in
either
hand
show
me
how
all
the
grounds
were
plann
the
lovely
garden
gently
slopes
to
where
a
curious
bridge
of
ropes
crosses
the
avon
to
the
park
we
rested
by
the
stream
to
mark
the
brown
backs
of
the
hovering
trout
frank
tickled
one
and
took
it
out
from
under
a
stone
we
saw
his
owls
and
awkward
fowls
and
shaggy
pony
in
the
croft
and
then
he
dragg
us
to
a
loft
where
pigeons
as
he
push
the
door
fann
clear
a
breadth
of
dusty
floor
and
set
us
coughing
i
confess
i
trembled
for
my
nice
silk
dress
i
can
not
think
how
vaughan
ventured
with
that
which
she
had
on
a
mere
white
wrapper
with
a
few
plain
trimmings
of
a
quiet
blue
but
oh
so
pretty
then
the
bell
for
dinner
rang
i
look
quite
well
charming
were
the
words
fred
said
with
the
new
gown
that
i
had
made
i
so
proud
of
frederick
he
so
and
with
vaughan
he
not
quite
so
at
home
with
me
but
that
you
know
i
ca
expect
or
wish
hurt
and
seem
to
mock
at
my
desert
not
but
that
i
a
duteous
wife
to
fred
but
in
another
life
where
all
are
fair
that
have
been
true
i
hope
i
shall
be
graceful
too
like
vaughan
and
now
that
happy
thought
has
made
me
cry
and
feel
half
sorry
that
my
cough
in
this
fine
air
is
leaving
off
iv
from
frederick
to
graham
honoria
trebly
fair
and
mild
with
added
loves
of
lord
and
child
is
else
unalter
years
which
wrong
the
rest
touch
not
her
beauty
young
within
youth
which
rather
seems
her
clime
than
aught
that
relative
to
time
how
beyond
hope
was
heard
the
prayer
i
offer
in
my
love
despair
could
any
whilst
there
any
woe
be
wholly
blest
then
she
were
so
she
is
and
is
aware
of
it
her
husband
endless
benefit
but
though
their
daily
ways
reveal
the
depth
of
private
joy
they
feel
not
their
bearing
each
to
each
that
does
abroad
their
secret
preach
but
such
a
lovely
to
all
within
their
government
and
friendship
as
is
well
discern
each
of
the
other
must
have
learn
for
no
mere
dues
of
neighbourhood
ever
begot
so
blest
a
mood
and
fair
indeed
should
be
the
few
god
dowers
with
nothing
else
to
do
and
liberal
of
their
light
and
free
to
show
themselves
that
all
may
see
for
alms
let
poor
men
poorly
give
the
meat
whereby
men
bodies
live
but
they
of
wealth
are
stewards
wise
whose
graces
are
their
charities
the
sunny
charm
about
this
home
makes
all
to
shine
who
thither
come
my
own
dear
jane
has
caught
its
grace
and
honour
honours
too
the
place
across
the
lawn
i
lately
alone
and
watch
where
mov
and
talk
gentle
and
of
air
honoria
and
some
stranger
fair
i
chose
a
path
unblest
by
these
when
one
of
the
two
goddesses
with
my
wife
voice
but
softer
said
you
not
walk
with
us
dear
fred
she
moves
indeed
the
modest
peer
of
all
the
proudest
ladies
here
unawed
she
talks
with
men
who
stand
among
the
leaders
of
the
land
and
women
beautiful
and
wise
with
england
greatness
in
their
eyes
to
high
traditional
and
knowledge
ripe
without
pretence
and
human
truth
exactly
hit
by
quiet
and
conclusive
wit
listens
my
little
homely
jane
mistakes
the
points
and
laughs
amain
and
after
stands
and
combs
her
hair
and
calls
me
much
the
wittiest
there
with
reckless
loyalty
dear
wife
she
lays
herself
about
my
life
the
joy
i
might
have
had
of
yore
i
have
not
for
is
now
no
more
with
me
the
lyric
time
of
youth
and
sweet
sensation
of
the
truth
yet
past
my
hope
or
purpose
bless
in
my
chance
choice
let
be
the
tenderer
providence
that
rules
the
fates
of
children
and
of
fools
i
kiss
the
kind
warm
neck
that
slept
and
from
her
side
this
morning
stepp
to
bathe
my
brain
from
drowsy
night
in
the
sharp
air
and
golden
light
the
dew
like
frost
was
on
the
pane
the
year
begins
though
fair
to
wane
there
is
a
fragrance
in
its
breath
which
is
not
of
the
flowers
but
death
and
green
above
the
ground
appear
the
lilies
of
another
year
i
wander
forth
and
took
my
path
among
the
bloomless
aftermath
and
heard
the
steadfast
robin
sing
as
if
his
own
warm
heart
were
spring
and
watch
him
feed
where
on
the
yew
hung
honey
drops
of
crimson
dew
and
then
return
by
walls
of
peach
and
bending
to
my
reach
and
with
the
roses
gone
to
breakfast
vaughan
was
there
none
with
her
i
confess
i
love
her
than
of
yore
no
less
but
she
alone
was
loved
of
old
now
love
is
twain
nay
manifold
for
somehow
he
whose
daily
life
adjusts
itself
to
one
true
wife
grows
to
a
nuptial
near
degree
with
all
that
fair
and
womanly
therefore
as
more
than
friends
we
met
without
constraint
without
regret
the
wedded
yoke
that
each
had
seeming
a
sanction
not
a
bond
from
graham
your
love
lacks
joy
your
letter
says
yes
love
requires
the
focal
space
of
recollection
or
of
hope
it
can
measure
its
own
scope
too
soon
too
soon
comes
death
to
show
we
love
more
deeply
than
we
know
the
rain
that
fell
upon
the
height
too
gently
to
be
call
delight
within
the
dark
vale
reappears
as
a
wild
cataract
of
tears
and
love
in
life
should
strive
to
see
sometimes
what
love
in
death
would
be
easier
to
love
we
so
should
find
it
is
than
to
be
just
and
kind
she
gone
shut
close
the
what
distance
for
another
did
that
death
has
done
for
her
the
good
once
gazed
upon
with
heedless
mood
now
fills
with
tears
the
famish
eye
and
turns
all
else
to
vanity
is
sad
to
see
with
death
between
the
good
we
have
pass
and
have
not
seen
how
strange
appear
the
words
of
all
the
looks
of
those
that
live
appal
they
are
the
ghosts
and
check
the
breath
there
no
reality
but
death
and
hunger
for
some
signal
given
that
we
shall
have
our
own
in
heaven
but
this
the
god
of
love
lets
be
a
horrible
uncertainty
how
great
her
smallest
virtue
seems
how
small
her
greatest
fault
ill
dreams
were
those
that
foil
with
loftier
grace
the
homely
kindness
of
her
face
was
here
she
sat
and
work
and
there
she
comb
and
kiss
the
children
hair
or
with
one
baby
at
her
breast
another
taught
or
hush
to
rest
praise
does
the
heart
no
more
refuse
to
the
chief
loveliness
of
use
her
humblest
good
is
hence
most
high
in
the
heavens
of
fond
memory
and
love
says
amen
to
the
word
a
prudent
wife
is
from
the
lord
her
worst
gown
kept
is
now
the
best
as
that
in
which
she
oftenest
dress
for
memory
sake
more
precious
grown
than
she
herself
was
for
her
own
poor
child
foolish
it
seem
to
fly
to
sobs
instead
of
dignity
when
she
was
hurt
now
none
than
all
and
angelical
that
ignorance
of
what
to
do
bewilder
still
by
wrong
from
you
for
what
man
ever
yet
had
grace
to
abuse
his
power
and
place
no
magic
of
her
voice
or
smile
suddenly
raised
a
fairy
isle
but
fondness
for
her
underwent
an
unregarded
increment
like
that
which
lifts
through
centuries
the
within
the
seas
till
lo
the
land
where
was
the
wave
alas
is
everywhere
her
grave
vi
from
jane
to
graham
dear
mother
i
can
surely
tell
now
that
i
never
shall
get
well
besides
the
warning
in
my
mind
all
suddenly
are
grown
so
kind
fred
stopp
the
doctor
yesterday
downstairs
and
when
he
went
away
came
smiling
back
and
sat
with
me
pale
and
conversing
cheerfully
about
the
spring
and
how
my
cough
in
finer
weather
would
leave
off
i
saw
it
all
and
told
him
plain
i
felt
no
hope
of
spring
again
then
he
after
a
word
of
jest
burst
into
tears
upon
my
breast
and
own
when
he
could
speak
he
knew
there
was
a
little
danger
too
this
made
me
very
weak
and
ill
and
while
last
night
i
lay
quite
still
and
as
he
fancied
in
the
deep
exhausted
rest
of
my
short
sleep
i
heard
or
dream
i
heard
him
pray
father
take
her
not
away
let
not
life
dear
assurance
lapse
into
death
agonised
perhaps
a
hope
without
thy
promise
where
less
than
assurance
is
despair
give
me
some
sign
if
go
she
must
that
death
not
worse
than
dust
to
dust
not
heaven
on
whose
oblivious
shore
joy
i
may
have
but
her
no
more
the
bitterest
cross
it
seems
to
me
of
all
is
infidelity
and
so
if
i
may
choose
i
miss
the
kind
of
heaven
which
comes
to
this
if
doom
indeed
this
fever
ceased
to
die
out
wholly
like
a
beast
forgetting
all
life
ill
success
in
dark
and
peaceful
nothingness
i
could
but
say
thy
will
be
done
for
dying
thus
i
were
but
one
of
seed
innumerable
which
in
all
the
worlds
shall
bloom
or
bear
i
put
life
past
to
so
poor
use
well
thou
life
to
come
refuse
and
justice
which
the
spirit
contents
shall
still
in
me
all
vain
laments
nay
pleased
i
will
while
yet
i
live
think
thou
my
forfeit
joy
give
to
some
fresh
life
else
unelect
and
heaven
not
feel
my
poor
defect
only
let
not
thy
method
be
to
make
that
life
and
call
it
me
still
less
to
sever
mine
in
twain
and
tell
each
half
to
live
again
and
count
itself
the
whole
to
die
is
it
love
disintegrity
answer
me
no
and
i
with
grace
will
life
brief
desolation
face
my
ways
as
native
to
the
clime
adjusting
to
the
wintry
time
with
a
patient
cheer
thereof
he
started
up
hearing
me
cough
oh
mother
now
my
last
doubt
gone
he
likes
me
than
vaughan
and
death
which
takes
me
from
his
side
shows
me
in
very
deed
his
bride
vii
from
jane
to
frederick
i
leave
this
dear
for
you
to
read
for
strength
and
hope
when
i
am
dead
when
grace
died
i
was
so
perplex
i
could
not
find
one
helpful
text
and
when
a
little
while
before
i
saw
her
sobbing
on
the
floor
because
i
told
her
that
in
heaven
she
would
be
as
the
angels
even
and
would
not
want
her
doll
is
true
a
horrible
fear
within
me
grew
that
since
the
preciousness
of
love
went
thus
for
nothing
mine
might
prove
to
be
no
more
and
heaven
bliss
some
dreadful
good
which
is
not
this
but
being
about
to
die
makes
clear
many
dark
things
i
have
no
fear
now
that
my
love
my
grief
my
joy
is
but
a
passion
for
a
toy
i
can
not
speak
at
all
i
find
the
shining
something
in
my
mind
that
shows
so
much
that
if
i
took
my
thoughts
all
down
make
a
book
god
word
which
lately
seem
above
the
simpleness
of
human
love
to
my
hearing
tells
of
little
or
of
nothing
else
and
many
things
i
hoped
were
true
when
first
they
came
like
songs
from
you
now
rise
with
witness
past
the
reach
of
doubt
and
i
to
you
can
teach
as
if
with
felt
authority
and
as
things
seen
what
you
taught
me
yet
how
i
have
no
words
but
those
which
every
one
already
knows
as
man
hath
at
any
time
seen
god
but
is
the
love
of
him
made
perfect
and
he
dwells
in
us
if
we
each
other
love
or
thus
goodness
misseth
in
extent
of
thee
lord
in
the
excellent
i
know
thee
and
the
saints
on
earth
make
all
my
love
and
holy
mirth
and
further
as
ye
did
it
to
one
of
these
to
me
ye
did
it
though
ye
nothing
thought
nor
knew
of
me
in
that
ye
wrought
what
shall
i
dread
will
god
undo
our
bond
which
is
all
others
too
and
when
i
meet
you
will
you
say
to
my
reclaiming
looks
a
dearer
love
my
bosom
warms
with
higher
rights
and
holier
charms
the
children
whom
thou
here
see
neighbours
that
mingle
thee
and
me
and
gaily
on
impartial
lyres
renounce
the
foolish
filial
fires
they
felt
with
praise
to
god
on
high
goodwill
to
all
else
equally
the
trials
duties
service
tears
the
many
fond
confiding
years
of
nearness
sweet
with
thee
apart
the
joy
of
body
mind
and
heart
the
love
that
grew
a
reckless
growth
unmindful
that
the
to
love
in
an
eternal
style
meant
only
for
a
little
while
sever
are
now
those
bonds
all
love
not
new
stands
here
for
nought
why
it
seems
almost
wicked
dear
even
to
utter
such
a
fear
are
we
not
as
man
and
wife
of
eternal
life
was
paradise
meant
to
fade
to
make
which
marriage
first
was
made
neither
beneath
him
nor
above
could
man
in
eden
find
his
love
yet
with
him
in
the
garden
his
god
and
with
him
mildly
talk
shall
the
humble
preference
offend
in
heaven
which
god
did
there
commend
are
and
the
names
of
aught
from
heaven
exiled
and
are
we
not
forbid
to
grieve
as
without
hope
does
god
deceive
and
call
that
hope
which
is
despair
namely
the
heaven
we
should
not
share
image
and
glory
of
the
man
as
he
of
god
is
woman
can
this
holy
sweet
proportion
die
into
a
dull
equality
are
we
not
one
flesh
yea
so
far
more
than
the
babe
and
mother
are
that
sons
are
bid
mothers
to
leave
and
to
their
wives
alone
to
cleave
two
are
one
flesh
but
is
in
the
flesh
we
rise
our
union
is
you
know
is
said
mystery
great
mockery
it
appears
to
me
poor
image
of
the
spousal
bond
of
christ
and
church
if
loosed
beyond
this
life
which
and
much
more
yet
there
not
a
single
word
to
set
the
speech
to
the
scoffing
sadducee
is
not
in
point
to
you
and
me
for
how
could
christ
have
taught
such
clods
that
caesar
things
are
also
god
the
sort
of
wife
the
law
could
make
might
well
be
for
love
sake
and
left
like
money
land
or
house
for
out
of
christ
is
no
true
spouse
i
used
to
think
it
strange
of
him
to
make
love
so
dim
or
only
clear
by
inference
but
god
trusts
much
to
common
sense
and
only
tells
us
what
without
his
word
we
could
not
have
found
out
on
fleshly
tables
of
the
heart
he
penn
truth
feeling
counterpart
in
hopes
that
come
to
all
so
dear
trust
these
and
be
of
happy
cheer
nor
think
that
he
who
has
loved
well
is
of
all
men
most
miserable
there
much
more
yet
i
want
to
say
but
can
not
now
you
know
my
way
of
feeling
strong
from
twelve
till
two
after
my
wine
i
write
to
you
daily
some
words
which
you
shall
have
to
break
the
silence
of
the
grave
viii
from
jane
to
frederick
you
think
perhaps
could
she
know
how
much
i
loved
her
dear
i
do
and
you
may
say
this
new
awe
of
heart
which
makes
her
fancies
law
these
watchful
duties
of
despair
she
does
not
dream
she
can
not
care
frederick
you
see
how
false
that
is
or
how
could
i
have
written
this
and
should
it
ever
cross
your
mind
that
now
and
then
you
were
unkind
you
never
never
were
at
all
remember
that
it
natural
for
one
like
vaughan
to
come
from
a
morning
useful
pastime
home
and
greet
with
such
a
courteous
zest
his
handsome
wife
still
newly
dress
as
if
the
bird
of
paradise
should
daily
change
her
plumage
thrice
he
always
well
she
always
gay
of
course
but
he
who
toils
all
day
and
comes
home
hungry
tired
or
cold
and
feels
do
him
good
to
scold
his
wife
a
little
let
him
trust
her
love
and
say
the
things
he
must
till
sooth
in
mind
by
meat
and
rest
if
after
that
she
well
caress
and
told
how
good
she
is
to
bear
his
humour
fortune
makes
it
fair
women
like
men
to
be
like
men
that
is
at
least
just
now
and
then
thus
i
have
nothing
to
forgive
but
those
first
years
how
could
i
live
when
though
i
really
did
behave
so
stupidly
you
never
gave
one
unkind
word
or
look
at
all
as
if
i
was
some
animal
you
pitied
now
in
later
life
you
used
me
like
a
proper
wife
you
feel
dear
in
your
present
mood
your
jane
since
she
was
kind
and
good
a
child
of
god
a
living
soul
was
not
so
different
on
the
whole
from
her
who
had
a
little
more
of
god
best
gifts
but
oh
be
sure
my
dear
dear
love
to
take
no
blame
because
you
could
not
feel
the
same
towards
me
living
as
when
dead
a
hungry
man
must
needs
think
bread
so
sweet
and
only
at
their
rise
and
setting
blessings
to
thine
eyes
like
the
sun
course
grow
visible
if
you
are
sad
remember
well
against
delusions
of
despair
that
memory
sees
things
as
they
were
and
not
as
they
were
misenjoy
and
would
be
still
if
aught
the
glory
of
their
hopelessness
so
that
in
truth
you
had
me
less
in
days
when
necessary
zeal
for
my
perfection
made
you
feel
my
faults
the
most
than
now
your
love
forgets
but
where
it
can
approve
you
gain
by
loss
if
that
seem
small
possess
which
being
gone
turns
all
surviving
good
to
vanity
oh
fred
this
makes
it
sweet
to
die
say
to
yourself
tis
comfort
yet
i
made
her
that
which
i
regret
and
parting
might
have
come
to
pass
in
a
worse
season
as
it
was
love
an
eternal
temper
took
dipp
glowing
in
death
icy
brook
or
say
her
poor
feeble
head
this
might
have
fallen
is
mine
instead
and
so
great
evil
sets
me
free
henceforward
from
calamity
and
in
her
little
children
too
how
much
for
her
i
yet
can
do
and
grieve
not
for
these
orphans
even
for
central
to
the
love
of
heaven
is
each
child
as
each
star
to
space
this
truth
my
dying
love
has
grace
to
trust
with
a
so
sure
content
i
fear
i
seem
indifferent
you
must
not
think
a
child
small
heart
cold
because
it
and
grief
soon
part
fanny
will
keep
them
all
away
lest
you
should
hear
them
laugh
and
play
before
the
funeral
over
then
i
hope
you
be
yourself
again
and
glad
with
all
your
soul
to
find
how
god
thus
to
the
sharpest
wind
suits
the
shorn
lambs
instruct
them
dear
for
my
sake
in
his
love
and
fear
and
show
now
till
their
journey
done
not
to
be
weary
they
must
run
strive
not
to
dissipate
your
grief
by
any
lightness
true
relief
of
sorrow
is
by
sorrow
brought
and
yet
for
sorrow
sake
you
ought
to
grieve
with
measure
do
not
spend
so
good
a
power
to
no
good
end
would
you
indeed
have
memory
stay
in
the
heart
lock
up
and
put
away
relies
and
likenesses
and
all
musings
which
waste
what
they
recall
true
comfort
and
the
only
thing
to
soothe
without
diminishing
a
prized
regret
is
to
match
here
by
a
strict
life
god
love
severe
yet
after
all
by
nature
course
feeling
must
lose
its
edge
and
force
again
you
reach
the
desert
tracts
where
only
sin
or
duty
acts
but
if
love
always
lit
our
path
where
were
the
trial
of
our
faith
oh
should
the
mournful
honeymoon
of
death
be
over
strangely
soon
and
resolutions
made
in
grievous
haste
as
quickly
fade
seeming
the
truth
of
grief
to
mock
think
dearest
is
not
by
the
clock
that
sorrow
goes
a
month
of
tears
is
more
than
many
many
years
of
common
time
shun
if
you
can
however
any
passionate
plan
grieve
with
the
heart
let
not
the
head
grieve
on
when
grief
of
heart
is
dead
for
all
the
powers
of
life
defy
a
superstitions
constancy
the
only
bond
i
hold
you
to
is
that
which
nothing
can
undo
a
man
is
not
a
young
man
twice
and
if
of
his
young
years
he
lies
a
faithful
score
in
one
wife
breast
she
need
not
mind
who
has
the
rest
in
this
do
what
you
will
dear
love
and
feel
quite
sure
that
i
approve
and
should
it
chance
as
it
may
be
give
her
my
from
me
and
never
dream
that
you
can
err
me
by
being
good
to
her
nor
let
remorseful
thoughts
destroy
in
you
the
kindly
flowering
joy
and
pleasure
of
the
natural
life
but
do
forget
your
fond
dead
wife
and
frederick
should
you
ever
be
tempted
to
think
your
love
of
me
all
fancy
since
it
drew
its
breath
so
much
more
sweetly
after
death
remember
that
i
never
did
a
single
thing
you
once
forbid
all
poor
folks
liked
me
and
at
the
end
your
cousin
call
me
friend
and
new
calm
your
grief
to
know
you
who
once
loved
honoria
so
there
kindness
that
look
kindly
on
between
her
emily
and
john
thus
in
your
children
you
will
wed
and
john
seems
much
comforted
like
isaac
when
mother
died
and
fair
rebekah
was
his
bride
by
his
new
hope
for
losing
me
so
is
happiness
you
see
and
that
reminds
me
how
last
night
i
dreamt
of
heaven
with
great
delight
a
strange
kind
lady
watch
my
face
kiss
me
and
cried
hope
found
grace
she
bade
me
then
in
the
crystal
floor
look
at
myself
myself
no
more
and
bright
within
the
mirror
shone
honoria
smile
and
yet
my
own
when
you
talk
i
hear
she
sigh
much
he
loved
her
many
a
bride
in
heaven
such
countersemblance
wears
through
what
love
deem
rejected
prayers
she
would
have
spoken
still
but
lo
one
of
a
glorious
troop
aglow
from
some
great
work
towards
her
came
and
she
so
laugh
was
such
a
flame
aaron
twelve
jewels
seem
to
mix
with
the
lights
of
the
seven
candlesticks
ix
from
lady
clitheroe
to
graham
my
dearest
aunt
the
but
for
jane
loss
and
you
away
was
all
a
bride
from
heaven
could
beg
skies
bluer
than
the
sparrow
egg
and
clearer
than
the
cuckoo
call
and
such
a
sun
the
flowers
all
with
double
ardour
seem
to
blow
the
very
daisies
were
a
show
expanded
with
uncommon
pride
like
little
pictures
of
the
bride
your
and
your
grandson
were
perfection
of
a
pretty
pair
how
well
honoria
girls
turn
out
although
they
never
go
about
dear
me
what
trouble
and
expense
it
took
to
teach
mine
confidence
greet
mankind
as
i
heard
say
that
wild
things
do
where
beasts
of
prey
were
never
known
nor
any
men
have
met
their
fearless
eyes
till
then
their
grave
inquiring
trust
to
find
all
creatures
of
their
simple
kind
quite
disconcerts
bold
coxcombry
and
makes
less
perfect
candour
shy
ah
graham
people
may
scoff
but
how
your
girls
go
off
how
hymen
hastens
to
unband
the
waist
that
felt
waltzer
hand
at
last
i
see
my
sister
right
and
i
told
maud
this
very
night
but
oh
my
daughters
have
such
wills
to
knit
and
only
dance
quadrilles
you
say
fred
never
writes
to
you
frankly
as
once
he
used
to
do
about
himself
and
you
complain
he
shared
with
none
his
grief
for
jane
it
all
comes
of
the
foolish
fright
men
feel
at
the
word
hypocrite
although
when
first
in
love
sometimes
they
rave
in
letters
talk
and
rhymes
when
once
they
find
as
find
they
must
how
hard
is
to
be
hourly
just
to
those
they
love
they
are
dumb
for
shame
where
we
you
see
talk
on
the
same
honoria
to
whose
heart
alone
he
seems
to
open
all
his
own
at
times
has
tears
in
her
kind
eyes
after
their
private
colloquies
he
her
most
favour
guest
and
moves
my
spleen
by
his
impartial
loves
his
pleasure
has
some
inner
spring
depending
not
on
anything
petting
our
polly
none
smiled
more
fondly
on
his
favourite
child
yet
playing
with
his
own
it
is
somehow
as
if
it
were
not
his
he
means
to
go
again
to
sea
now
that
the
wedding
over
he
will
leave
to
emily
and
john
the
little
ones
to
practise
on
and
mrs
rouse
a
dear
old
soul
from
wilton
house
will
scold
the
housemaids
and
the
cook
till
emily
has
learn
to
look
a
little
braver
than
a
lamb
surprised
by
dogs
without
its
dam
do
dear
aunt
use
your
influence
and
try
to
teach
some
plain
good
sense
to
mary
is
not
yet
too
late
to
make
her
change
her
chosen
state
of
single
silliness
in
truth
i
fancy
that
with
fading
youth
her
will
now
wavers
yesterday
though
till
the
bride
was
gone
away
joy
shone
from
mary
loving
heart
i
found
her
afterwards
apart
hysterically
sobbing
i
knew
much
too
well
to
ask
her
why
this
marrying
of
nieces
daunts
the
bravest
souls
of
maiden
aunts
though
sisters
children
often
blend
sweetly
the
bonds
of
child
and
friend
they
are
but
reeds
to
rest
upon
when
emily
comes
back
with
john
her
right
to
go
downstairs
before
aunt
mary
will
but
be
the
more
observed
if
kindly
waived
and
how
shall
these
be
as
they
were
when
now
niece
has
her
john
and
aunt
the
sense
of
her
superior
innocence
somehow
all
loves
however
fond
prove
lieges
of
the
nuptial
bond
and
she
who
dares
at
this
to
scoff
finds
all
the
rest
in
time
drop
off
while
marriage
like
a
spreads
its
sure
circle
every
spring
she
twice
refused
george
vane
you
know
yet
when
be
died
three
years
ago
in
the
indian
war
she
put
on
gray
and
wears
no
colours
to
this
day
and
she
it
is
who
charges
dear
aunt
with
x
from
frederick
to
honoria
cousin
my
thoughts
no
longer
try
to
cast
the
fashion
of
the
sky
imagination
can
extend
scarcely
in
part
to
comprehend
the
sweetness
of
our
common
food
ambrosial
which
ingratitude
and
impious
inadvertence
waste
studious
to
eat
but
not
to
taste
and
who
can
tell
what
yet
in
store
there
but
that
earthly
things
have
more
of
all
that
makes
their
inmost
bliss
and
life
an
image
still
of
this
but
haply
such
a
glorious
one
as
is
the
rainbow
of
the
sun
sweet
are
your
words
but
after
all
their
mere
reversal
may
befall
the
partners
of
his
glories
who
daily
is
crucified
anew
splendid
privations
martyrdoms
to
which
no
weak
remission
comes
perpetual
passion
for
the
good
of
them
that
feel
no
gratitude
far
circlings
as
of
planets
fires
round
desires
whatever
rapturously
sighs
that
life
is
love
love
sacrifice
all
i
am
sure
of
heaven
is
this
the
mode
i
shall
not
miss
one
true
delight
which
i
have
known
not
on
the
changeful
earth
alone
shall
loyalty
remain
unmoved
everything
i
ever
loved
so
heaven
voice
calls
like
rachel
voice
to
jacob
in
the
field
serve
on
some
seven
more
sordid
years
too
short
for
weariness
or
tears
serve
on
then
oh
beloved
take
me
for
ever
as
thy
bride
xi
from
mary
churchill
to
the
dean
charles
does
me
honour
but
vain
to
reconsider
now
again
and
so
to
doubt
the
truth
i
sought
for
and
received
when
youth
being
fair
and
woo
by
one
whose
love
was
lovely
fail
my
mind
to
move
god
bids
them
by
their
own
will
go
who
ask
again
the
things
they
know
i
grieve
for
my
infirmity
and
ignorance
of
how
to
be
faithful
at
once
to
the
heavenly
life
and
the
fond
duties
of
a
wife
narrow
am
i
and
want
the
art
to
love
two
things
with
all
my
heart
occupied
singly
in
his
search
who
in
the
mysteries
of
the
church
returns
and
calls
them
clouds
of
heaven
i
tread
a
road
straight
hard
and
even
but
fear
to
wander
all
confused
by
fealty
abused
either
should
i
the
one
forget
or
scantly
pay
the
other
debt
you
bid
me
father
count
the
cost
i
have
and
all
that
must
be
lost
i
feel
as
only
woman
can
to
make
the
heart
wealth
of
some
man
and
through
the
untender
world
to
move
wrapt
safe
in
his
superior
love
how
sweet
how
sweet
the
household
round
of
duties
and
their
narrow
bound
so
plain
that
to
transgress
were
hard
yet
full
of
manifest
reward
the
charities
not
marr
like
mine
with
chance
of
thwarting
laws
divine
the
world
regards
and
just
delight
in
one
that
clearly
kindly
right
how
sweet
dear
father
i
endure
not
without
sharp
regret
be
sure
to
give
up
such
glad
certainty
for
what
perhaps
may
never
be
for
nothing
of
my
state
i
know
but
that
heaven
i
seem
to
go
as
one
who
fondly
landward
hies
along
a
deck
that
seaward
flies
with
every
year
meantime
some
grace
of
earthly
happiness
gives
place
to
humbling
ills
the
very
charms
of
youth
being
counted
henceforth
harms
to
blush
already
seems
absurd
nor
know
i
whether
i
should
herd
with
girls
or
wives
or
sadlier

maids

but
strait
the
gate
of
life
late
besides
now
to
change
my
fate
for
flowers
and
fruit
of
love
to
form
it
must
he
spring
as
well
as
warm
the
world
delight
my
soul
dejects
revenging
all
my
disrespects
of
old
with
incapacity
to
chime
with
even
its
harmless
glee
which
sounds
from
fields
beyond
my
range
like
fairies
music
thin
and
strange
with
something
like
remorse
i
grant
the
world
has
beauty
which
i
want
and
if
instead
of
judging
it
i
at
its
council
chance
to
sit

at

and

my

seems

of
the
life
to
be

me
with
inefficiency
and
makes
me
all
unfit
to
bless
with
comfortable
earthliness
the
brain
of
man
finally
them
i
fix
my
plan
to
dwell
with
him
that
dwells
apart
in
the
highest
heaven
and
lowliest
heart
nor
will
i
to
my
utter
loss
look
to
pluck
roses
from
the
cross
as
for
the
good
of
human
love
countercheck
almost
enough
to
think
that
one
must
die
before
the
other
and
perhaps
is
more
in
love
last
interest
to
do
nought
the
least
contrary
thereto
than
to
be
blest
and
be
unjust
or
suffer
injustice
as
they
must
without
a
miracle
whose
pact
compels
to
mutual
life
and
act
whether
love
shines
or
darkness
sleeps
cold
on
the
spirit
changeful
deeps
enough
if
to
my
earthly
share
fall
gleams
that
keep
me
from
despair
happy
the
things
we
here
discern
more
happy
those
for
which
we
yearn
but
measurelessly
happy
above
all
else
are
those
we
guess
not
of
xii
from
felix
to
honoria
dearest
my
love
and
wife
is
long
ago
i
closed
the
unfinish
song
which
never
could
be
finish
nor
will
ever
poet
utter
more
of
love
than
i
did
watching
well
to
lure
to
speech
the
unspeakable
won
i
that
final
strain
to
the
last
height
flew
of
written
joy
which
wants
the
smile
and
voice
that
are
indeed
the
while
they
last
the
very
things
you
speak
honoria
who
music
weak
with
ways
that
say
i
not
be
as
kind
to
all
as
heaven
to
me
and
yet
ah
my
bride
rising
this
twentieth
you
still
soft
sleeping
on
this
day
of
days
some
words
i
long
to
say
some
words
superfluously
sweet
of
fresh
assurance
thus
to
greet
your
waking
eyes
which
never
grow
weary
of
telling
what
i
know
so
well
yet
only
well
enough
to
wish
for
further
news
thereof
here
in
this
early
autumn
dawn
by
windows
opening
on
the
lawn
where
sunshine
seems
asleep
though
bright
and
shadows
yet
are
sharp
with
night
and
further
on
the
wealthy
wheat
bends
in
a
golden
drowse
how
sweet
to
sit
and
cast
my
careless
looks
around
my
walls
of
books
wherein
is
all
that
stands
from
time
huge
wreck
all
men
have
of
truth
and
all
by
poets
known
of
feeling
and
in
weak
sort
shown
and
turning
to
my
heart
again
to
find
i
have
what
makes
them
vain
the
thanksgiving
mind
which
wisdom
sums
and
you
whereby
it
freshly
comes
as
on
that
morning
can
there
be
years
it
and
me
when
thrill
with
hopeful
love
i
rose
and
came
in
haste
to
sarum
close
past
many
a
homestead
slumbering
white
in
lonely
and
pathetic
light
merely
to
fancy
which
drawn
blind
of
thirteen
had
my
love
behind
and
in
her
sacred
neighbourhood
to
feel
that
sweet
scorn
of
all
good
but
her
which
let
the
wise
forfend
when
wisdom
learns
to
comprehend
dearest
as
each
returning
may
i
see
the
season
new
and
gay
with
new
joy
and
astonishment
and
nature
infinite
ostent
of
lovely
flowers
in
wood
and
mead
that
weet
not
whether
any
heed
so
see
i
daily
wondering
you
and
worship
with
a
passion
new
the
heaven
that
visibly
allows
its
grace
to
go
about
my
house
the
partial
heaven
that
though
i
err
and
mortal
am
gave
all
to
her
who
gave
herself
to
me
yet
i
boldly
thank
heaven
and
so
defy
the
beggarly
soul
humbleness
which
fears
god
bounty
to
confess
that
i
was
fashion
with
a
mind
seeming
for
this
great
gift
design
so
naturally
it
moved
above
all
sordid
contraries
of
love
strengthen
in
youth
with
discipline
of
light
to
follow
the
divine
vision
which
ever
to
the
dark
is
such
a
plague
as
was
the
ark
in
ashdod
gath
and
ekron
still
discerning
with
the
docile
will
which
comes
of
full
persuaded
thought
that
intimacy
in
love
is
nought
without
pure
reverence
whereas
this
in
tearfullest
banishment
is
bliss
and
so
dearest
honoria
i
have
never
learn
the
weary
sigh
of
those
that
to
their
went
fed
and
forgot
the
sacrament
and
not
a
trifle
now
occurs
but
sweet
initiation
stirs
of
joy
and
lends
to
feeling
change
that
never
ends
and
duties
which
the
many
irk
are
made
all
wages
and
no
work
how
sing
of
such
things
save
to
her
love
self
so
love
interpreter
how
the
supreme
rewards
confess
which
crown
the
austere
voluptuousness
of
heart
that
earns
in
midst
of
wealth
the
appetite
of
want
and
health
relinquishes
the
pomp
of
life
and
beauty
to
the
pleasant
wife
at
home
and
does
all
joy
despise
as
out
of
place
but
in
her
eyes
how
praise
the
years
and
gravity
that
make
each
favour
seem
to
be
a
lovelier
weakness
for
her
lord
and
ah
how
find
the
tender
word
to
tell
aright
of
love
that
glows
the
fairer
for
the
fading
rose
of
frailty
which
can
weight
the
arm
to
lean
with
thrice
its
girlish
charm
of
grace
which
like
this
autumn
day
is
not
the
sad
one
of
decay
yet
one
whose
pale
brow
pondereth
the
majesty
of
death
how
tell
the
crowd
whom
a
passion
rends
that
love
grows
mild
as
it
ascends
that
joy
most
high
and
distant
mood
is
lost
not
found
in
dancing
blood
albeit
kind
acts
and
smiling
eyes
and
all
those
fond
realities
which
are
love
words
in
us
mean
more
delight
than
twenty
years
before
how
dearest
finish
without
wrong
to
the
speechless
heart
the
unfinish
song
its
high
eventful
passages
consisting
say
of
things
like
these
one
morning
contrary
to
law
which
for
the
most
we
held
in
awe
commanding
either
not
to
intrude
on
the
other
place
of
solitude
or
solitary
mind
for
fear
of
coming
there
when
god
was
near
and
finding
so
what
should
be
known
to
him
who
is
merciful
alone
and
views
the
working
ferment
base
of
waking
flesh
and
sleeping
grace
not
as
we
view
our
kindness
by
likeness
of
our
own
defect
i
venturing
to
her
room
because
mark
the
excuse
my
birthday
was
saw
here
across
a
careless
chair
a
flung
as
light
as
air
and
here
beside
a
silken
couch
pillows
which
did
the
pressure
vouch
of
pious
knees
sweet
piety
of
goodness
made
and
charity
if
gay
looks
told
the
heart
glad
sense
much
rather
than
of
penitence
and
on
the
couch
an
open
book
and
written
list
i
did
not
look
yet
just
in
her
clear
writing
caught
faults
of
life
and
thought
which
most
i
need
deliverance
from
i
turn
aside
and
saw
her
come
adown
the
way
beautified
with
her
usual
gay
hypocrisy
of
perfectness
which
made
her
heart
and
mine
no
less
so
happy
and
she
cried
to
me
lose
by
breaking
rules
you
see
your
birthday
treat
is
now
of
seeing
my
new
on
and
meeting
so
my
lovely
wife
a
passing
pang
to
think
that
life
was
mortal
when
i
saw
her
laugh
shaped
in
my
mind
this
epitaph
had
she
child
of
adam
stem
but
only
heaven
knew
of
them
or
thus
for
many
a
dreadful
day
in
lodgings
sick
she
lay
noteless
of
love
nor
seem
to
hear
the
sea
on
one
side
thundering
near
nor
on
the
other
the
loud
ball
held
nightly
in
the
public
hall
nor
vex
they
my
short
slumbers
though
i
woke
up
if
she
breathed
too
low
thus
for
three
months
with
terrors
rife
the
pending
of
her
precious
life
i
watched
and
the
danger
at
last
the
kind
physician
said
was
past
howbeit
for
seven
harsh
weeks
the
east
breathed
witheringly
and
spring
growth
ceased
and
so
she
only
did
not
die
until
the
bright
and
blighting
sky
changed
into
cloud
and
the
sick
flowers
remember
their
perfumes
and
showers
of
warm
small
rain
refreshing
flew
before
the
south
and
the
park
grew
in
three
nights
thick
with
green
then
she
revived
no
less
than
flower
and
tree
in
the
mild
air
and
the
fourth
day
looked
supernaturally
gay
with
large
thanksgiving
eyes
that
shone
the
while
i
tied
her
bonnet
on
so
that
i
led
her
to
the
glass
and
bade
her
see
how
fair
she
was
and
how
love
visibly
could
shine
profuse
of
hers
desiring
mine
and
mindful
i
had
loved
her
most
when
beauty
seem
a
vanish
boast
she
laugh
i
press
her
then
to
me
nothing
but
soft
humility
nor
enhanced
she
with
such
charms
her
acquiescence
in
my
arms
and
by
her
sweet
made
courageous
powerful
and
glad
in
a
clear
illustration
high
of
heavenly
affection
i
perceived
that
utter
love
is
all
the
same
as
to
be
rational
and
that
the
mind
and
heart
of
love
which
think
they
can
not
do
enough
are
truly
the
everlasting
doors
wherethrough
all
unpetition
pours
the
eternal
pleasance
wherefore
we
had
innermost
tranquillity
and
breathed
one
life
with
such
a
sense
of
friendship
and
of
confidence
that
recollecting
the
sure
word
two
of
you
are
in
accord
on
earth
as
touching
any
boon
which
ye
shall
ask
it
shall
be
done
in
heaven
we
ask
that
heaven
bliss
might
be
any
less
than
this
and
for
that
hour
we
seem
to
have
the
secret
of
the
joy
we
gave
how
sing
of
such
things
save
to
her
love
self
so
love
interpreter
how
read
from
such
a
homely
page
in
the
ear
of
this
unhomely
age
is
now
as
when
the
prophet
cried
nation
hast
thou
multiplied
but
thou
hast
not
increased
the
joy
and
yet
ere
wrath
or
rot
destroy
of
england
state
the
ruin
fair
oh
might
i
so
its
charm
declare
that
in
new
lands
in
years
delighted
he
should
cry
that
hears
is
the
land
that
somewhat
best
works
to
the
wonder
of
the
rest
we
in
our
day
have
better
done
this
thing
or
that
than
any
one
and
who
but
still
admiring
sees
how
excellent
for
images
was
greece
for
laws
how
wise
was
rome
but
read
this
poet
and
say
if
home
and
private
love
did
so
smile
as
in
that
ancient
english
isle
xiii
from
lady
clitheroe
to
emily
graham
my
dearest
niece
i
charm
to
hear
the
scenery
fine
at
windermere
and
glad
a
wife
defers
in
the
least
to
wisdom
not
yet
hers
but
child
i
no
advice
to
give
rules
only
make
it
hard
to
live
and
where
the
good
of
having
been
well
taught
from
seven
to
seventeen
if
married
you
may
not
leave
off
and
say
at
last
good
enough
weeding
out
folly
still
leave
some
it
gives
both
lightness
and
we
know
however
wise
by
rule
woman
is
still
by
nature
fool
and
men
have
sense
to
like
her
all
the
more
when
she
is
natural
is
true
that
if
we
choose
we
can
mock
to
a
miracle
the
man
but
iron
in
the
fire
red
hot
though
is
the
heat
the
fire
is
not
and
who
for
such
a
feint
would
pledge
the
babe
and
woman
privilege
no
duties
and
a
thousand
rights
besides
defect
love
flow
incites
as
water
in
a
well
will
run
only
the
while
is
drawn
upon
de
culte
sans
mystere
you
say
what
if
that
should
die
away
child
never
fear
that
either
could
pull
from
saint
cupid
face
the
hood
the
follies
natural
to
each
surpass
the
other
moral
reach
just
think
how
men
with
sword
and
gun
will
really
fight
and
never
run
and
all
in
sport
they
would
have
died
for
sixpence
more
on
the
other
side
a
woman
heart
must
ever
warm
at
such
odd
ways
and
so
we
charm
by
strangeness
which
the
more
they
mark
the
more
men
get
into
the
dark
the
marvel
by
familiar
life
grows
and
attaches
to
the
wife
by
whom
it
grows
thus
silly
girl
to
john
you
always
be
the
pearl
in
the
oyster
of
the
universe
and
though
in
time
he
treat
you
worse
he
love
you
more
you
need
not
doubt
and
never
never
find
you
out
my
dear
i
know
that
dreadful
thought
that
you
been
kinder
than
you
ought
it
almost
makes
you
hate
him
yet
wonderful
how
men
forget
and
how
a
merciful
providence
deprives
our
husbands
of
all
sense
of
kindness
past
and
makes
them
deem
we
always
were
what
now
we
seem
for
their
own
good
we
must
you
know
however
plain
the
way
we
go
still
make
it
strange
with
stratagem
and
instinct
tells
us
that
to
them
always
right
to
bate
their
price
yet
i
must
say
they
rather
nice
and
oh
so
easily
taken
in
to
cheat
them
almost
seems
a
sin
and
dearest
be
most
unfair
to
john
your
feelings
to
compare
with
his
or
any
man
for
she
who
loves
at
all
loves
always
he
who
loves
far
more
loves
yet
by
fits
and
when
the
wayward
wind
remits
to
blow
his
feelings
faint
and
drop
like
when
the
bellows
stop
such
things
do
trouble
you
at
all
when
once
you
know
they
natural
my
love
to
john
and
pray
my
dear
do
let
me
see
you
for
a
year
unless
indeed
ere
then
you
that
beauties
wed
are
blossoms
to
unripe
codlings
meant
to
dwell
in
modest
shadow
hidden
well
till
this
green
stage
again
permute
to
glow
of
flowers
with
good
of
fruit
i
will
not
have
my
patience
tried
by
your
absurd
pride
that
scorns
the
world
sense
ties
up
the
hands
of
providence
rules
babes
before
there
hope
of
one
better
than
mothers
have
done
and
for
your
poor
particular
neglects
delights
and
graces
far
beyond
your
crude
and
thin
conceit
age
has
romance
almost
as
sweet
and
much
more
generous
than
this
of
yours
and
john
with
all
the
bliss
of
the
evenings
when
you
coo
with
him
and
upset
home
for
your
sole
whim
you
might
have
envied
were
you
wise
the
tears
within
your
mother
eyes
which
i
dare
say
you
did
not
see
but
let
that
pass
yours
yet
will
be
i
hope
as
happy
kind
and
true
as
lives
which
now
seem
void
to
you
have
you
not
seen
paste
their
gold
in
sheets
then
rub
to
waste
full
half
and
lo
you
read
the
name
well
time
my
dear
does
much
the
same
with
this
unmeaning
glare
of
love
but
though
you
yet
may
much
improve
in
marriage
be
it
still
confess
there
little
merit
at
the
best
some
lives
indeed
which
else
would
not
have
had
the
need
get
food
and
nurture
as
the
price
of
antedated
paradise
but
what
that
to
the
varied
want
succour
by
mary
your
dear
aunt
who
put
the
bridal
crown
thrice
by
for
that
of
which
virginity
so
used
has
hope
she
sends
her
love
as
usual
with
a
proof
thereof
papa
discourse
which
you
no
doubt
heard
none
of
neatly
copied
out
whilst
we
were
dancing
all
are
well
adieu
for
there
the
luncheon
bell
the
wedding
sermon
the
truths
of
love
are
like
the
sea
for
clearness
and
for
mystery
of
that
sweet
love
which
startling
wakes
maiden
and
youth
and
mostly
breaks
the
word
of
promise
to
the
ear
but
keeps
it
after
many
a
year
to
the
full
spirit
how
shall
i
speak
my
memory
with
age
is
weak
and
i
for
hopes
do
oft
suspect
the
things
i
seem
to
recollect
yet
who
but
must
remember
well
this
made
heaven
intelligible
as
motive
though
was
small
the
power
the
heart
might
have

those
perpetual

never

to

true

with

of
vestal
joy
to
move
frantic
like

so

yet
no

dangerous
misconceit
may
also
be
of

whose

is
nuptial
blessing
still
and
whose
true
being
doth
subsist
there
where
the
outward
forms
are
miss
in
those
who
learn
and
keep
the
sense
divine
of
benevolence
seeking
for
aye
without
alloy
of
selfish
thought
another
joy
and
finding
in
degrees
unknown
that
which
in
act
they
shunn
their
own
for
all
delights
of
earthly
love
are
shadows
of
the

and
move
as

they
flee
from
him
that
follows
them
and
he
who
flies
for

his

embraced
by
their

then
even
in

do
i
not

so

foreshown
the

thus
crown
from
being
thereto
enough
without
the
long
compulsive
awe
of
duty
that
the
bond
of
law
does
oftener
evoke
than
love
which
does
not
wear
the
yoke
of
legal
vows
submits
to
be
from
ruinous
liberty
lovely
is
love
but
age
well
knows
law
which
kept
the
lover
vows
inviolate
through
the
year
or
years
of
worship
pieced
with
panic
fears
when
she
who
lay
within
his
breast
seem
of
all
women
perhaps
the
best
but
not
the
whole
of
womankind
or
love
in
his
yet
wayward
mind
had
ghastly
doubts
its
precious
life
was
pledged
for
aye
to
the
wrong
wife
could
it
be
else
a
youth
pursues
a
maid
whom
chance
not
he
did
choose
till
to
his
strange
arms
hurries
she
in
a
despair
of
modesty
then
simply
and
without
pretence
of
insight
or
experience
they
plight
their
vows
the
parents
say
can
not
speak
them
yea
or
nay
the
thing
proceedeth
from
the
lord
and
wisdom
still
approves
their
word
for
god
created
so
these
two
they
match
as
well
as
others
do
that
take
more
pains
and
trust
him
less
who
never
fails
if
ask
to
bless
his
children
helpless
ignorance
and
blind
election
of
life
chance
verily
choice
not
matters
much
if
but
the
woman
truly
such
and
the
young
man
has
led
the
life
without
which
how
shall
the
wife
be
the
one
woman
in
the
world
love
sensitive
tendrils
sicken
round
folly
former
stay
for
is
the
doom
of
all
unsanction

to
mock
some
good
that
gain
keeps
still
the
taint
of
the
rejected
howbeit
though
both
were
perfect
she
of
whom
the
maid
was
prophecy
as
yet
lives
not
and
love
rebels
against
the
law
of
any
else
and
as
a
steed
takes
blind
alarm
disowns
the
rein
and
hunts
his
harm
so
misdespairing
word
and
act
may
now
perturb
the
happiest
pact
the
more
indeed

the
more
peril

now
in

against

nothing
can
be

only
this
leave
ill
alone
who
tries
to
mend
his

as
he
who
knows
not
what
he

he
much
affronts
a
worth
as
high
as
his

that
equality
of

which
abide
the

that
our

honour

honour
to
deny

shame
and
robbery
for
it
is
the
mould
wherein
to
beauty

the
prop
that
lifts
to
the

the
crop
of
human
sensibilities
such
honour
with
a
conduct
wise
in

things
as
not
to
steep
the
lofty

of

in
sleep
of
over
much
familiarness
not
to
degrade
its
kind
caress
as
those
do
that
can
feel
no
more
so
give
themselves
to
pleasures
not
to
let
destroy
the
domestic
joy
not
by
uxoriousness
to
chill
the
warm
devotion
of
her
will
who
can

half
her

confer

him
that
cares
for
nought

her

it

lacking

reaching

in

sorrow
for

of
this

the
pathos
of

does
in

all
eyes
and
pride
of
life
perhaps
she
is
not
the
likelier
wife
if
it
be
thus
if
you
have
known
as
who
has
not
some
heavenly
one
whom
the
dull
background
of
despair
help
to
show
forth
supremely
fair
if
memory
still
remorseful
shapes
young
passion
bringing
eshcol
grapes
to
travellers
in
the
wilderness
this
truth
will
make
regret
the
less
mighty
in
love
as
graces
are
god
ordinance
is
mightier
far
and
he
who
is
but
just
and
kind
and
patient
shall
for
guerdon
find
before
long
that
the
body
bond
is
all
else
utterly
beyond
in
power
of
love
to
actualise
the
soul
bond
which
it
signifies
and
even
to
deck
a
wife
with
grace
external
in
the
form
and
face
a
five
years
wife
and
not
yet
fair
blame
let
the
man
not
nature
bear
for
as
the
sun
warming
a
bank
where
last
year
grass
droops
gray
and
dank
evokes
the
violet
bids
disclose
in
yellow
crowds
the
fresh
primrose
and
foxglove
hang
her
flushing
head
so
vernal
love
where
all
seems
dead
makes
beauty
abound
then
was
that
nought
that
trance
of
joy
beyond
all
thought
the
vision
in
one
of
womanhood
nay
for
all
women
holding
good
should
marriage
such
a
prologue
want
sordid
and
most
ignorant
profanity
but
having
this
honour
now
and
future
bliss
for
where
is
he
that
knowing
the
height
and
depth
of
ascertain
delight
inhumanly
henceforward
lies
content
with
mediocrities
amelia
mine
eyes
do
my
amelia
greet
it
is
with
such
emotion
as
when
in
childhood
turning
a
dim
street
i
first
beheld
the
ocean
there
where
the
little
bright
town
that
shew
me
first
her
beauty
and
the
sea
gathers
its
skirts
against
the
down
and
scatters
gardens
the
southern
lea
abides
this
maid
within
a
kind
yet
sombre
mother
shade
who
of
her
daughter
graces
seems
almost
afraid
viewing
them
ofttimes
with
a
scared
forecast
caught
haply
from
obscure
past
that
be
she
scants
me
of
my
right
is
cunning
careful
evermore
to
balk
sweet
separate
talk
and
fevers
my
delight
by
frets
if
on
amelia
cheek
of
peach
i
touch
the
notes
which
music
can
not
reach
bidding
wherefore
it
came
that
till
dear
date
i
curs
the
weary
months
which
yet
i
have
to
wait
ere
i
find
heaven
with
my
mate
the
mother
gave
to
urgent
pleas
and
promise
to
behave
as
she
were
there
her
consent
to
trust
amelia
with
me
to
the
grave
where
lay
my
millicent
said
she
hiding
ill
a
moistening
eye
sir
the
word
sounds
hard
god
makes
as
if
he
least
knew
how
to
guard
the
treasure
he
loves
best
simplicity
and
there
amelia
stood
for
fairness
shewn
like
a
young
in
flush
array
of
white
and
ruddy
auroral
gay
with
chilly
blue
the
maiden
branch
between
and
yet
to
look
on
her
moved
less
the
mind
to
say
beauteous
than
good
and
kind
and
so
we
went
alone
by
walls
which
the
lilac
numerous
plume
shook
down
perfume
trim
plots
close
blown
with
daisies
in
conspicuous
myriads
seen
engross
each
one
with
single
ardour
for
her
spouse
the
sun
garths
in
their
glad
array
of
white
and
ruddy
branch
auroral
gay
with
azure
chill
the
maiden
between
meadows
of
fervid
green
with
sometime
sudden
prospect
of
untold
cowslips
like
gold
and
broadcast
buttercups
at
joyful
gaze
rending
the
air
with
praise
like
the
shout
of
jacob
camp
in
midian
put
to
rout
then
through
the
park
where
spring
to
livelier
gloom
quicken
the
cedars
dark
and
the
clear
sky
cold
which
shone
afar
crowded
with
sunny
alps
oracular
great
chestnuts
raised
themselves
abroad
like
cliffs
of
bloom
and
everywhere
amid
the
ceaseless
rapture
of
the
lark
with
wonder
new
we
caught
the
solemn
voice
of
single
air
and
when
amelia
saw
and
heard
how
bravely
sang
the
bird
and
all
things
in
god
bounty
did
rejoice
she
who
her
mother
by
spake
seldom
word
did
her
charm
silence
doff
and
to
my
happy
marvel
her
dear
voice
went
as
a
clock
does
when
the
pendulum
off
ill
monarch
of
man
heart
the
maiden
who
does
not
aspire
to
be
too
so
she
repeated
soft
her
poet
line
grace
divine
not
otherwise
o
nature
are
we
thine
and
i
up
the
bright
steep
she
led
me
trod
and
the
like
thought
pursued
with
is
gladness
without
gratitude
and
where
is
gratitude
without
a
god
and
of
delight
the
guerdon
of
his
laws
she
spake
in
learned
mood
and
i
of
him
loved
reverently
as
cause
her
sweetly
as
occasion
of
all
good
nor
were
we
shy
for
souls
in
heaven
that
be
may
talk
of
heaven
without
hypocrisy
and
now
when
we
drew
near
the
low
gray
church
in
its
sequester
dell
a
shade
upon
me
fell
dead
millicent
indeed
had
been
most
sweet
but
i
how
little
meet
to
call
such
graces
in
a
maiden
mine
a
boy
proud
passion
free
affection
blunts
his
flatteries
oft
are
blind
affronts
and
many
a
tear
was
millicent
before
i
manlier
knew
that
maidens
shine
as
diamonds
do
which
though
most
clear
are
not
to
be
seen
through
and
if
she
put
her
virgin
self
aside
and
sate
her
crownless
at
my
conquering
feet
it
should
have
bred
in
me
humility
not
pride
amelia
had
more
luck
than
millicent
secure
she
smiled
and
warm
from
all
mischance
or
from
my
knowledge
or
my
ignorance
and
glow
content
with
my
some
might
have
thought
too
much
superior
age
which
seem
the
gage
of
steady
kindness
all
on
her
intent
thus
nought
forbade
us
to
be
fully
blent
while
therefore
now
her
pensive
footstep
the
darnell
garden
of
unheedful
death
she
ask
what
millicent
was
like
and
heard
of
eyes
like
her
and
honeysuckle
breath
and
of
a
wiser
than
a
woman
brow
yet
fill
with
only
woman
love
and
how
an
incidental
greatness
her
unconsider
ways
but
all
my
praise
amelia
thought
too
slight
for
millicent
and
on
my
arm
she
leant
for
more
attent
and
the
i
gave
to
deck
her
breast
she
dropp
upon
the
grave
this
was
her
said
i
decoring
with
a
band
of
mildest
pearls
amelia
milder
hand
i
will
wear
it
for
sake
she
said
for
dear
to
maidens
are
their
rivals
dead
and
so
she
seated
on
the
black
yew
tortured
root
i
on
the
carpet
of
sere
shreds
below
and
nigh
the
little
mound
where
lay
that
other
i
kiss
her
lips
three
times
without
dispute
and
with
bold
worship
suddenly
aglow
i
lifted
to
my
lips
a
sandall
foot
and
kiss
it
three
times
thrice
without
dispute
upon
my
head
her
fingers
fell
like
snow
her
hands
about
my
neck
she
wreathed
her
arms
like
slumber
my
shoulders
crept
and
with
her
bosom
whence
the
azalea
breathed
she
did
my
face
full
favourably
smother
to
hide
the
heaving
secret
that
she
wept
now
would
i
keep
my
promise
to
her
mother
now
i
arose
and
raised
her
to
her
feet
my
best
amelia
from
a
kiss
in
birthdew
shuddering
sweet
with
great
kind
eyes
in
whose
brown
shade
bright
venus
and
her
baby
play
at
inmost
heart
well
pleased
with
one
another
what
time
the
slant
sun
low
through
the
plough
field
does
each
clod
sharply
shew
and
softly
fills
with
shade
the
dimples
of
our
homeward
hills
with
little
said
we
left
the
garden
of
the
dead
and
gain
the
shoulder
of
the
down
that
keeps
the
from
the
nestling
town
and
caught
once
more
the
vision
of
the
wave
where
on
the
horizon
dip
a
ship
pursued
alone
her
distant
purpose
grave
and
by
steep
steps
to
the
dim
street
i
led
her
sacred
feet
and
so
the
daughter
gave
soft
sweet
showy
as
and
shy
as
musk
back
to
her
mother
anxious
in
the
dusk
and
now
me
shall
the
phantom
months
no
more
affright
for
heaven
gates
to
open
well
waits
he
who
keeps
himself
the
key
the
day
after
perchance
she
droops
within
the
hollow
gulf
which
the
great
wave
of
coming
pleasure
draws
not
guessing
the
glad
cause
ye
clouds
that
on
your
endless
journey
go
ye
winds
that
westward
flow
thou
heaving
sea
that
her
and
me
tell
her
i
come
then
only
sigh
your
pleasure
and
be
dumb
for
the
sweet
secret
of
our
either
self
we
know
tell
her
i
come
and
let
her
heart
be
still
one
day
controlled
hope
and
then
one
more
and
on
the
third
our
lives
shall
be
fulfill
yet
all
has
been
before
palm
placed
in
palm
twin
smiles
and
words
astray
what
other
should
we
say
but
shall
i
not
with
a
sign
perceive
whilst
her
sweet
hands
i
hold
the
myriad
threads
and
meshes
manifold
which
love
shall
round
her
weave
the
pulse
in
that
vein
making
alien
pause
and
varying
beats
from
this
down
each
long
finger
felt
a
differing
strand
of
silvery
welcome
bland
and
in
her
breezy
palm
and
silken
wrist
beneath
the
touch
of
my
like
numerous
bliss
complexly
kiss
a
diverse
and
distinguishable
calm
what
should
we
say
it
all
has
been
before
and
yet
our
lives
shall
now
be
first
fulfill
and
into
their
summ
sweetness
fall
one
sweet
drop
more
one
sweet
drop
more
in
absolute
increase
of
unrelapsing
peace
o
heaving
sea
that
as
if
for
bliss
of
her
and

and
separatest
not
dear
heart
from
heart
though
each
other
beats
too
far
apart
for
yet
awhile
let
it
not
seem
that
i
behold
her
smile
o
weary
love
o
folded
to
her
breast
love
in
each
moment
years
and
years
of
rest
be
calm
as

of
intolerable
delight

blazing
photosphere
of

night

terror
thou
swarthy
groom
of
coy
let
me
not
see
thee
toy
o
death
too
tardy
with
thy
hope
intense
of
kisses
close
beyond
conceit
of
sense
o
life
too
liberal
while
to
take
her
hand
is
more
of
hope
than

can
understand
perturb
my
golden
patience
not
with
joy
nor
through
a
wish
profane
the
peace
that
should
pertain
to
him
who
does
by
her
attraction
move
has
all
not

one
day
controlled
hope
and
one
again
and
then
the
third
and
ye
shall
have
the
rein
o

love
but
soon
let
your
unrestful
rapture
cease
ye
flaming
ethers
thin
condensing
till
the
abiding
sweetness
win
one
sweet
drop
more
one
sweet
drop
more
in
the
measureless
increase
of
honied
peace
the
azalea
there
where
the
sun
shines
first
against
our
room
she
train
the
gold
azalea
whose
perfume
she
from
her
breathing
grace
dispersed
last
night
the
delicate
crests
of
saffron
bloom
for
that
their
dainty
likeness
watch
and
nurst
were
just
at
point
to
burst
at
dawn
i
dream
o
god
that
she
was
dead
and
groan
aloud
upon
my
wretched
bed
and
waked
ah
god
and
did
not
waken
her
but
lay
with
eyes
still
closed
perfectly
bless
in
the
delicious
sphere
by
which
i
knew
so
well
that
she
was
near
my
heart
to
speechless
thankfulness
composed
till
to
stir
a
dizzy
somewhat
in
my
troubled
head
it
the
azalea
breath
and
she
dead
the
warm
night
had
the
lingering
buds
disclosed
and
i
had
asleep
with
to
my
breast
a
letter
in
which
she
said
till
eve
my
own
adieu
parting
with
soon
again
to
meet
soon
in
your
arms
to
feel
so
small
and
sweet
sweet
to
myself
that
am
so
sweet
to
you
departure
it
was
not
like
your
great
and
gracious
ways
do
you
that
have
nought
other
to
lament
never
my
love
repent
of
how
that
july
afternoon
you
went
with
sudden
unintelligible
phrase
and
frighten
eye
upon
your
journey
of
so
many
days
without
a
single
kiss
or
a
i
knew
indeed
that
you
were
parting
soon
and
so
we
sate
within
the
low
sun
rays
you
whispering
to
me
for
your
voice
was
weak
your
harrowing
praise
well
it
was
well
to
hear
you
such
things
speak
and
i
could
tell
what
made
your
eyes
a
growing
gloom
of
love
as
a
warm
sombres
a
march
grove
and
it
was
like
your
great
and
gracious
ways
to
turn
your
talk
on
daily
things
my
dear
lifting
the
luminous
pathetic
lash
to
let
the
laughter
flash
whilst
i
drew
near
because
you
spoke
so
low
that
i
could
scarcely
hear
but
all
at
once
to
leave
me
at
the
last
more
at
the
wonder
than
the
loss
aghast
with
huddled
unintelligible
phrase
and
frighten
eye
and
go
your
journey
of
all
days
with
not
one
kiss
or
a
and
the
only
loveless
look
the
look
with
which
you
pass
all
unlike
your
great
and
gracious
ways
the
toys
my
little
son
who
look
from
thoughtful
eyes
and
moved
and
spoke
in
quiet
wise
having
my
law
the
seventh
time
disobey
i
struck
him
and
with
hard
words
and
unkiss
his
mother
who
was
patient
being
dead
then
fearing
lest
his
grief
should
hinder
sleep
i
visited
his
bed
but
found
him
slumbering
deep
with
darken
eyelids
and
their
lashes
yet
from
his
late
sobbing
wet
and
i
with
moan
kissing
away
his
tears
left
others
of
my
own
for
on
a
table
drawn
beside
his
head
he
had
put
within
his
reach
a
box
of
counters
and
a
stone
a
piece
of
glass
abraded
by
the
beach
and
six
or
seven
shells
a
bottle
with
bluebells
and
two
french
copper
coins
ranged
there
with
careful
art
to
comfort
his
sad
heart
so
when
that
night
i
to
god
i
wept
and
said
ah
when
at
last
we
lie
with
tranced
breath
not
vexing
thee
in
death
and
thou
rememberest
of
what
toys
we
made
our
joys
how
weakly
understood
thy
great
commanded
good
then
fatherly
not
less
than
i
whom
thou
hast
moulded
from
the
clay
leave
thy
wrath
and
say
will
be
sorry
for
their
childishness
i
were
dead
i
were
dead
you
sometimes
say
poor
child
the
dear
lips
quiver
as
they
spake
and
the
tears
brake
from
eyes
which
not
to
grieve
me
brightly
smiled
poor
child
poor
child
i
seem
to
hear
your
laugh
your
talk
your
song
it
is
not
true
that
love
will
do
no
wrong
poor
child
and
did
you
think
when
you
so
cried
and
smiled
how
i
in
lonely
nights
should
lie
awake
and
of
those
words
your
full
avengers
make
poor
child
poor
child
and
now
unless
it
be
that
sweet
amends
thrice
told
are
come
to
thee
o
god
have
thou
mercy
upon
me
poor
child
a
farewell
with
all
my
will
but
much
against
my
heart
we
two
now
part
my
very
dear
our
solace
is
the
sad
road
lies
so
clear
it
needs
no
art
with
faint
averted
feet
and
many
a
tear
in
our
opposed
paths
to
persevere
go
thou
to
east
i
west
we
will
not
say
there
any
hope
it
is
so
far
away
but
o
my
best
when
the
one
darling
of
our
widowhead
the
nursling
grief
is
dead
and
no
dews
blur
our
eyes
to
see
the
come
in
evening
skies
perchance
we
may
where
now
this
night
is
day
and
even
through
faith
of
still
averted
feet
making
full
circle
of
our
banishment
amazed
meet
the
bitter
journey
to
the
bourne
so
sweet
seasoning
the
termless
feast
of
our
content
with
tears
of
recognition
never
dry
sponsa
dei
what
is
this
maiden
fair
the
laughing
of
whose
eye
is
in
man
heart
renew
virginity
who
yet
sick
longing
breeds
for
marriage
which
exceeds
the
inventive
guess
of
love
to
satisfy
with
hope
of
utter
binding
and
of
loosing
endless
dear
despair
what
gleams
about
her
shine
more
transient
than
delight
and
more
divine
if
she
does
something
but
a
little
sweet
as
gaze
towards
the
glass
to
set
her
hair
see
how
his
soul
falls
humbled
at
her
feet
her
gentle
step
to
go
or
come
gains
her
more
merit
than
a
martyrdom
and
if
she
dance
it
doth
such
grace
confer
as
opes
the
heaven
of
heavens
to
more
than
her
and
makes
a
rival
of
her
worshipper
to
die
unknown
for
her
were
little
cost
so
is
she
without
guile
her
mere
refused
smile
makes
up
the
sum
of
that
which
may
be
lost
who
is
this
fair
whom
each
hath
seen
the
darkest
once
in
this
bewailed
dell
be
he
not
destin
for
the
glooms
of
hell
whom
each
hath
seen
and
known
with
sharp
remorse
and
sweet
as
queen
and
mistress
of
his
hopes
of
bliss
too
fair
for
man
to
kiss
who
is
this
only
happy
she
whom
by
a
frantic
flight
of
courtesy
born
of
despair
of
better
lodging
for
his
spirit
fair
he
adores
as
margaret
maude
or
cecily
and
what
this
sigh
that
each
one
heaves
for
earth
last
lowlihead
and
the
heaven
high
ineffably
lock
in
dateless
are
all
then
mad
or
is
it
prophecy
now
we
are
of
god
as
we
have
heard
what
we
shall
be
hath
not
yet
appear
o
heart
remember
thee
that
man
is
none
save
one
what
if
this
lady
be
thy
soul
and
he
who
claims
to
enjoy
her
sacred
beauty
be
not
thou
but
god
and
thy
sick
fire
a
female
vanity
such
as
a
bride
viewing
her
mirror
charms
feels
when
she
sighs
these
are
for
his
arms
a
reflex
heat
flash
on
thy
cheek
from
his
immense
desire
which
waits
to
crown
beyond
thy
brain
conceit
thy
nameless
secret
hopeless
longing
sweet
not
but
now
unless
deny
him
thou
the
rosy
bosom
hours
a
florin
to
the
willing
guard
secured
for
half
the
way
he
lock
us
in
ah
a
curtain
front
coupe
the
sparkling
sun
of
august
shone
the
wind
was
in
the
west
your
gown
and
all
that
you
had
on
was
what
became
you
best
and
we
were
in
that
seldom
mood
when
soul
with
soul
agrees
mingling
like
flood
with
equal
flood
in
agitated
ease
far
round
each
blade
of
harvest
bare
its
little
load
of
bread
each
furlong
of
that
journey
fair
with
separate
sweetness
sped
the
calm
of
use
was
coming
the
wonder
of
our
wealth
and
now
maybe
was
not
much
more
than
eden
common
health
we
paced
the
sunny
platform
while
the
train
at
havant
changed
what
made
the
people
kindly
smile
or
stare
with
looks
estranged
too
radiant
for
a
wife
you
seem
serener
than
a
bride
me
happiest
born
of
men
i
deem
and
show
perchance
my
pride
i
loved
that
girl
so
gaunt
and
tall
who
whispered
loud
thing
scanning
your
figure
slight
yet
all
round
as
your
own
gold
ring
at
salisbury
you
stray
alone
within
the
shafted
glooms
whilst
i
was
by
the
verger
shown
the
brasses
and
the
tombs
at
tea
we
talk
of
matters
deep
of
joy
that
never
dies
we
laugh
till
love
was
mix
with
sleep
within
your
great
sweet
eyes
the
next
day
sweet
with
luck
no
less
and
sense
of
sweetness
past
the
full
tide
of
our
happiness
rose
higher
than
the
last
at
dawlish
the
pools
of
brine
you
stept
from
rock
to
rock
one
hand
quick
tightening
upon
mine
one
holding
up
your
frock
on
starfish
and
on
weeds
alone
you
seem
intent
to
be
flash
those
great
gleams
of
hope
unknown
from
you
or
from
the
sea
came
before
ah
when
again
shall
come
two
days
like
these
such
quick
delight
within
the
brain
within
the
heart
such
peace
i
thought
indeed
by
magic
chance
a
third
from
heaven
to
win
but
as
at
dusk
we
reach
penzance
a
drizzling
rain
set
in
eros
bright
thro
the
valley
gallops
the
brooklet
over
the
welkin
travels
the
cloud
touch
by
the
zephyr
dances
the
harebell
cuckoo
sits
somewhere
singing
so
loud
two
little
children
seeing
and
hearing
hand
in
hand
wander
shout
laugh
and
sing
lo
in
their
bosoms
wild
with
the
marvel
love
like
the
crocus
is
come
ere
the
spring
young
men
and
women
noble
and
tender
yearn
for
each
other
faith
truly
plight
promise
to
cherish
comfort
and
honour
vow
that
makes
duty
one
with
delight
oh
but
the
glory
found
in
no
story
radiance
of
eden
unquench
by
the
fall
few
may
remember
none
may
reveal
it
this
the
first
the
first
love
