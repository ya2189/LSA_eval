or
the
bit
an
allegory
forge
of
vulcan
the
spawn
of
ixion
when
ixion
from
heaven
was
to
hell
to
be
for
ever
in
a
perpetual
damning
wheel
the
pit
eternal
pains
to
feel
for
a
bestial
vulgar
deed
whereby
that
mortal
did
succeed
in
sinking
juno
to
the
sod
seducing
that
god
abomination
foul
was
this
to
ruin
lovely
juno
bliss
to
raise
in
heaven
domestic
strife
jupiter
and
his
lov
wife
with
sins
that
never
were
forgiven
to
scandalize
the
court
of
heaven
when
jupiter
in
pity
took
this
wretch
to
heaven
on
earth
forsook
he
was
a
vile
thing
despised
by
peasant
prince
and
king
a
vagrant
shun
and
curst
for
sending
æneus
to
the
dust
the
aged
father
of
his
wife
base
ixion
deprived
of
life
into
a
pit
of
burning
fire
he
cast
poor
æneus
to
expire
and
while
this
cruel
knave
for
sending
æneus
to
his
grave
from
every
circle
under
heaven
with
scorn
contemptuous
was
driven
this
wretched
outcast
here
forsaken
by
jupiter
was
kindly
taken
into
the
realms
above
the
skies
and
introduced
to
deities
at
the
tables
of
the
gods
he
set
this
scoundrel
of
the
clods
such
heavenly
condescension
should
inspire
a
mortal
gratitude
in
ixion
base
and
blacken
breast
some
thankfulness
should
even
rest
his
heart
though
steep
in
every
deed
of
darkness
in
the
devil
creed
in
every
sin
that
stains
the
earth
or
blackens
hell
which
gave
it
birth
should
now
have
felt
a
kindly
glow
for
what
great
jupiter
did
do
but
ixion
did
only
feel
a
base
desire
at
once
to
steal
the
heart
of
juno
and
to
tread
on
jupiter
celestial
bed
he
had
an
intrigue
with
the
cloud
of
juno
which
the
gods
allow
and
thus
the
monstrous
centaur
came
from
ixion
and
juno
shame
but
jupiter
with
thunder
the
villain
from
the
heavenly
world
sent
him
to
hell
to
feel
the
ceaseless
torments
of
the
wheel
but
his
vile
offspring
stays
behind
the
bane
and
curse
of
human
kind
possessing
still
the
bestial
fire
which
deep
disgraced
and
damn
the
sire
the
same
inglorious
meanness
strays
in
the
vile
veins
and
verse
and
lays
of
him
on
crutches
devil
half
at
whom
his
kindred
centaurs
laugh
in
that
deformity
of
hell
on
whom
its
attributes
have
fell
in
him
whose
shameless
wicked
life
is
with
abomination
rife
whose
works
thrice
damn
and
doubly
dead
the
produce
of
conceit
and
lead
possess
no
other
aim
nor
end
but
foul
abuse
of
foe
and
friend
his
heart
polluted
with
the
dung
of
demons
damn
from
hell
out
flung
is
rotten
to
the
core
with
lies
from
which
foul
slanders
thickly
rise
his
soul
most
pitiful
and
mean
infected
with
gangrene
no
kind
redeeming
trait
contains
but
reeks
with
bestial
blots
and
stains
his
mind
with
vulgar
vice
imbued
libidinous
and
low
and
lewd
deep
stained
with
malice
hate
and
spleen
with
sentiments
supremely
mean
is
bent
on
mischief
foul
as
hell
which
the
hideous
centaurs
yell
low
was
his
birth
and
low
his
name
low
is
his
life
and
low
his
fame
but
lower
still
the
depths
of
wo
where
park
when
dead
and
damn
must
go
friends
foes
or
fiends
alike
he
fights
in
all
he
says
or
sings
or
writes
this
foul
defamer
crawling
round
the
brink
of
hell
to
catch
its
sound
exsudes
it
thence
in
doleful
rhyme
debased
and
reeking
rank
with
crime
on
this
deformity
of
man
more
monstrous
than
the
bastard
pan
pegasus
turn
his
nimble
feet
as
park
on
crutches
crawl
the
street
urging
that
steed
against
his
will
to
bear
him
up
helicon
hill
but
pegasus
a
knowing
horse
perceived
that
park
conceited
verse
was
only
suited
to
the
stews
of
hell
whence
emanates
his
muse
he
therefore
with
bellerophon
left
him
behind
well
trampled
on
to
tune
a
pilfer
broken
lyre
in
fields
of
mud
and
muck
and
mire
and
there
his
song
most
lowly
set
winding
through
marshes
undulcet
contending
always
with
the
fog
unable
to
flee
the
bog
does
charm
perhaps
the
frogs
and
snakes
and
loathsome
reptiles
of
the
lakes
although
some
demon
sprite
may
haply
listen
with
delight
to
park
low
growling
song
as
through
the
sloughs
it
pours
along
and
though
in
marshes
fens
and
ditches
it
may
perhaps
amuse
the
witches
yet
should
an
unsuspecting
team
hear
unawares
the
dismal
scream
of
his
verse
sadly
frighten
every
horse
and
had
the
children
in
the
wood
just
heard
his
strain
and
understood
its
wretched
wrangling
dismal
din
how
frighten
had
those
children
been
believing
soon
that
doom
would
crack
or
that
the
was
on
their
track
had
robert
kid
that
pirate
knave
heard
it
come
creaking
the
wave
he
had
supposed
some
demon
shell
was
sounding
from
the
gates
of
hell
the
red
men
savage
wild
and
rude
deep
buried
in
their
solitude
would
wake
affrighted
from
their
dreams
if
haply
park
poetic
screams
should
penetrate
their
secret
lair
and
they
forthwith
would
kneel
in
prayer
to
the
great
spirit
of
the
sun
believing
that
their
days
were
done
that
hell
dark
hole
was
open
thrown
and
that
this
strain
was
satan
own
in
wrath
now
prowling
through
the
wood
devouring
indians
for
his
food
david
crockett
would
have
run
affrighted
from
his
game
and
gun
had
he
but
heard
in
woods
remote
park
incongruous
jangling
note
wild
screeching
on
the
western
gale
an
unpoetic
dismal
wail
nor
stopp
in
his
despairing
flight
in
san
jacinto
to
fight
but
rushing
wildly
and
forlorn
to
the
billows
off
cape
horn
most
likely
there
himself
had
drown
in
terror
of
the
doleful
sound
in
western
wilds
had
daniel
boon
but
heard
for
once
the
lecherous
loon
he
would
have
dropp
his
axe
and
gun
and
to
the
eastward
rapid
run
nor
stay
in
all
his
fearful
flight
for
wind
or
storm
through
day
and
night
till
he
some
civil
spot
could
reach
uncursed
by
park
dolorous
screech
and
had
columbus
heard
his
roar
when
first
he
landed
on
this
shore
he
would
have
turn
his
bark
amain
and
never
ventured
here
again
impress
that
in
this
western
world
there
was
from
pandemonium
hurl
some
spirit
damn
for
to
bark
the
hideous
songs
of
hideous
the
owls
and
bats
that
curse
the
land
could
they
but
hear
and
understand
the
wretched
rhymes
and
nauseous
stuff
of
this
conceited
vile
would
surely
leave
their
secret
haunts
and
ever
cease
their
nightly
chants
convinced
that
they
have
been
at
last
in
frightful
strains
by
park
surpast
and
that
this
vagrant
of
the
muse
foul
caterer
for
sinks
and
stews
the
poet
has
outdone
all
they
have
ever
screech
or
sung
despairing
thence
they
would
retire
long
distance
from
his
loathsome
lyre
and
let
their
lonely
caves
and
rocks
resound
with
his
poetic
shocks
to
be
perhaps
all
rent
in
twain
by
his
unearthly
rumbling
strain
as
i
was
musing
on
this
theme
i
fell
asleep
and
had
a
dream
i
saw
the
fish
that
skim
the
deep
and
the
billows
nimbly
leap
all
sink
beneath
the
boiling
wave
down
to
the
lowest
depths
to
lave
for
they
had
heard
the
dismal
lay
of
park
come
booming
down
the
bay
and
doubtless
thought
some
hungry
shark
was
chasing
them
with
hellish
bark
that
his
sharp
teeth
already
nigh
would
them
destroy
and
they
must
die
that
there
alas
was
no
escape
from
his
terrific
gab
and
gape
and
that
their
watery
run
was
now
alas
for
ever
done
and
as
they
deep
in
ocean
ink
despairing
to
the
bottom
sink
by
that
infernal
sound
they
cast
a
gloomy
gaze
around
and
call
on
neptune
god
to
smite
the
rascal
with
his
rod
to
pierce
him
with
his
trident
spear
and
pitch
him
into
hell
to
sear
to
stew
and
fry
in
satan
dish
for
frightening
thus
poor
harmless
fish
but
neptune
monarch
of
the
main
with
scorn
and
disdain
look
down
on
park
lugubrious
rhyme
and
hasten
the
boiling
brine
unheedful
of
the
fishes
cry
and
left
them
with
park
songs
to
die
his
foaming
horses
now
he
lash
which
through
the
boisterous
billows
dash
affrighted
at
the
dismal
strain
now
wildly
screeching
the
main
the
god
of
ocean
angry
wave
desirous
only
now
to
save
himself
from
that
unearthly
screech
flew
swift
with
might
and
main
to
reach
the
portals
of
the
heavenly
world
whence
ixion
disgraced
was
hurl
and
there
to
gods
assembled
tell
what
lately
in
the
sea
befell
the
finny
tribes
that
swim
the
deep
now
sunk
perhaps
in
endless
sleep
the
hosts
of
heaven
when
neptune
came
with
foaming
horses
from
the
main
rejoiced
to
see
the
briny
king
the
golden
gates
wide
open
fling
and
anxiously
all
beg
to
know
the
tidings
from
the
world
below
great
neptune
their
celestial
guest
with
haste
thus
their
request
o
jove
high
heaven
majestic
king
to
whom
all
gods
due
homage
bring
and
now
the
monarch
of
the
sea
with
awful
reverence
bows
the
knee
i
come
in
haste
and
wish
to
tell
how

infernal
fiend

an
ixion
spawn
kick
down
from

through
the
earth
a
vagrant
driven
a
lyre

he
with
hempen
strings
hath
rigg
and
now
the
ocean

bays
makes
nightly
hideous
with
his
lays
last
night
as
i
was
going
to
bed
the
villain
struck
the
fish
all
dead
his
dismal
strain

ca
abide
it
smote
their
ears
and
lo
they
died
my
noble
steeds
affrighted
too
like
lightning
through
the
billows
flew
nor
could
the
hellish
note
divine
that
creak
terrific

brine
and
even
i
myself
was
shock

from

chariot
nearly
into

boisterous
boiling

minstrelsy

by
all
