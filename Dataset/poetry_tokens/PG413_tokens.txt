my
brother
in
the
island
mode
in
every
tongue
and
meaning
much
my
friend
this
story
of
your
country
and
your
clan
in
your
loved
house
your
too
much
honoured
guest
i
made
in
english
take
it
being
done
and
let
me
sign
it
with
the
name
you
gave
teriitera
i
the
slaying
of
támatéa
it
fell
in
the
days
of
old
as
the
men
of
taiárapu
tell
a
youth
went
forth
to
the
fishing
and
fortune
favoured
him
well
támatéa
his
name
gullible
simple
and
kind
comely
of
countenance
nimble
of
body
empty
of
mind
his
mother
ruled
him
and
loved
him
beyond
the
wont
of
a
wife
serving
the
lad
for
eyes
and
living
herself
in
his
life
alone
from
the
sea
and
the
fishing
came
támatéa
the
fair
urging
his
boat
to
the
beach
and
the
mother
awaited
him
there
may
you
live
said
she
fishing
has
sped
to
a
wish
and
now
let
us
choose
for
the
king
the
fairest
of
all
your
fish
for
fear
inhabits
the
palace
and
grudging
grows
in
the
land
marked
is
the
sluggardly
foot
and
marked
the
niggardly
hand
the
hours
and
the
miles
are
counted
the
tributes
numbered
and
weighed
and
woe
to
him
that
comes
short
and
woe
to
him
that
delayed
so
spoke
on
the
beach
the
mother
and
counselled
the
wiser
thing
for
rahéro
stirred
in
the
country
and
secretly
mined
the
king
nor
were
the
signals
wanting
of
how
the
leaven
wrought
in
the
cords
of
obedience
loosed
and
the
tributes
grudgingly
brought
and
when
last
to
the
temple
of
oro
the
boat
with
the
victim
sped
and
the
priest
uncovered
the
basket
and
looked
on
the
face
of
the
dead
trembling
fell
upon
all
at
sight
of
an
ominous
thing
for
there
was
the
aito
dead
and
he
of
the
house
of
the
king
so
spake
on
the
beach
the
mother
matter
worthy
of
note
and
wattled
a
basket
well
and
chose
a
fish
from
the
boat
and
támatéa
the
pliable
shouldered
the
basket
and
went
and
travelled
and
sang
as
he
travelled
a
lad
that
was
well
content
still
the
way
of
his
going
was
round
by
the
roaring
coast
where
the
ring
of
the
reef
is
broke
and
the
trades
run
riot
the
most
on
his
left
with
smoke
as
of
battle
the
billows
battered
the
land
unscalable
turreted
mountains
rose
on
the
inner
hand
and
cape
and
village
and
river
and
vale
and
mountain
above
each
had
a
name
in
the
land
for
men
to
remember
and
love
and
never
the
name
of
a
place
but
lo
a
song
in
its
praise
ancient
and
unforgotten
songs
of
the
earlier
days
that
the
elders
taught
to
the
young
and
at
night
in
the
full
of
the
moon
garlanded
boys
and
maidens
sang
together
in
tune
támatéa
the
placable
went
with
a
lingering
foot
he
sang
as
loud
as
a
bird
he
whistled
hoarse
as
a
flute
he
broiled
in
the
sun
he
breathed
in
the
grateful
shadow
of
trees
in
the
icy
stream
of
the
rivers
he
waded
over
the
knees
and
still
in
his
empty
mind
crowded
a
the
deeds
of
the
strong
and
the
songs
of
the
cunning
heroes
of
old
and
now
was
he
come
to
a
place
taiárapu
honoured
the
most
where
a
silent
valley
of
woods
debouched
on
the
noisy
coast
spewing
a
level
river
there
was
a
haunt
of
pai
there
in
his
potent
youth
when
his
parents
drove
him
to
die
honoura
lived
like
a
beast
lacking
the
lamp
and
the
fire
washed
by
the
rains
of
the
trade
and
clotting
his
hair
in
the
mire
and
there
so
mighty
his
hands
he
bent
the
tree
to
his
so
keen
the
spur
of
his
hunger
he
plucked
it
naked
of
fruit
there
as
she
pondered
the
clouds
for
the
shadow
of
coming
ills
ahupu
the
woman
of
song
walked
on
high
on
the
hills
of
these
was
rahéro
sprung
a
man
of
a
godly
race
and
inherited
cunning
of
spirit
and
beauty
of
body
and
face
of
yore
in
his
youth
as
an
aito
rahéro
wandered
the
land
delighting
maids
with
his
tongue
smiting
men
with
his
hand
famous
he
was
in
his
youth
but
before
the
midst
of
his
life
paused
and
fashioned
a
song
of
farewell
to
glory
and
strife
of
upon
the
of
all
my
by
of
the
strong
ravine
of
in
your
woody
summits
i
hear
the
of
your
sounds
the
all
sounds
on
sound
to
have
heard
the
applause
of
have
heard
it
arise
and
now
in
my
house
i
hear
the
these
were
the
words
of
his
singing
other
the
thought
of
his
heart
for
secret
desire
of
glory
vexed
him
dwelling
apart
lazy
and
crafty
he
was
and
loved
to
lie
in
the
sun
and
loved
the
cackle
of
talk
and
the
true
word
uttered
in
fun
lazy
he
was
his
roof
was
ragged
his
table
was
lean
and
the
fish
swam
safe
in
his
sea
and
he
gathered
the
near
and
the
green
he
sat
in
his
house
and
laughed
but
he
loathed
the
king
of
the
land
and
he
uttered
the
grudging
word
under
the
covering
hand
treason
spread
from
his
door
and
he
looked
for
a
day
to
come
a
day
of
the
crowding
people
a
day
of
the
summoning
drum
when
the
vote
should
be
taken
the
king
be
driven
forth
in
disgrace
and
rahéro
the
laughing
and
lazy
sit
and
rule
in
his
place
here
támatéa
came
and
beheld
the
house
on
the
brook
and
rahéro
was
there
by
the
way
and
covered
an
oven
to
cook
naked
he
was
to
the
loins
but
the
tattoo
covered
the
lack
and
the
sun
and
the
shadow
of
palms
dappled
his
muscular
back
swiftly
he
lifted
his
head
at
the
fall
of
the
coming
feet
and
the
water
sprang
in
his
mouth
with
a
sudden
desire
of
meat
for
he
marked
the
basket
carried
covered
from
flies
and
the
sun
and
rahéro
buried
his
fire
but
the
meat
in
his
house
was
done
forth
he
stepped
and
took
and
delayed
the
boy
by
the
hand
and
vaunted
the
joys
of
meat
and
the
ancient
ways
of
the
land
sires
of
old
in
taiárapu
they
that
created
the
race
ate
ever
with
eager
hand
nor
regarded
season
or
place
ate
in
the
boat
at
the
oar
on
the
way
afoot
and
at
night
arose
in
the
midst
of
dreams
to
rummage
the
house
for
a
bite
it
is
good
for
the
youth
in
his
turn
to
follow
the
way
of
the
sire
and
behold
how
fitting
the
time
for
here
do
i
cover
my
see
the
fire
for
the
cooking
but
never
the
meat
to
cook
said
said
rahéro
in
the
brook
and
there
in
the
tumbling
sea
the
fishes
are
thick
as
flies
hungry
like
healthy
men
and
like
pigs
for
savour
and
size
crayfish
crowding
the
river
thronging
the
it
may
be
says
the
other
yet
be
nothing
to
me
fain
would
i
eat
but
alas
i
have
needful
matter
in
hand
since
i
carry
my
tribute
of
fish
to
the
jealous
king
of
the
now
at
the
word
a
light
sprang
in
eyes
will
gain
me
a
dinner
thought
he
lend
the
king
a
and
he
took
the
lad
by
the
arm
as
they
stood
by
the
side
of
the
track
and
smiled
and
rallied
and
flattered
and
pushed
him
forward
and
back
it
was
that
sing
like
a
bird
i
never
have
heard
you
sing
and
lads
when
i
was
a
lad
were
none
so
feared
of
a
king
and
of
what
account
is
an
hour
when
the
heart
is
empty
of
guile
but
come
and
sit
in
the
house
and
laugh
with
the
women
awhile
and
i
will
but
drop
my
hook
and
behold
the
dinner
so
támatéa
the
pliable
hung
up
his
fish
in
the
shade
on
a
tree
by
the
side
of
the
way
and
rahéro
carried
him
in
smiling
as
smiles
the
fowler
when
flutters
the
bird
to
the
gin
and
chose
him
a
shining
hook
and
viewed
it
with
sedulous
eye
and
breathed
and
burnished
it
well
on
the
brawn
of
his
naked
thigh
and
set
a
mat
for
the
gull
and
bade
him
be
merry
and
bide
like
a
man
concerned
for
his
guest
and
the
fishing
and
nothing
beside
now
when
rahéro
was
forth
he
paused
and
hearkened
and
heard
the
gull
jest
in
the
house
and
the
women
laugh
at
his
word
and
stealthily
crossed
to
the
side
of
the
way
to
the
shady
place
where
the
basket
hung
on
a
mango
and
craft
transfigured
his
face
deftly
he
opened
the
basket
and
took
of
the
fat
of
the
fish
the
cut
of
kings
and
chieftains
enough
for
a
goodly
dish
this
he
wrapped
in
a
leaf
set
on
the
fire
to
cook
and
buried
and
next
the
marred
remains
of
the
tribute
he
took
and
doubled
and
packed
them
well
and
covered
the
basket
close
is
a
buffet
my
king
quoth
he
a
nauseous
dose
and
hung
the
basket
again
in
the
shade
in
a
cloud
of
flies
there
is
a
sauce
to
your
dinner
king
of
the
crafty
eyes
soon
as
the
oven
was
open
the
fish
smelt
excellent
good
in
the
shade
by
the
house
of
rahéro
down
they
sat
to
their
food
and
cleared
the
leaves
in
silence
or
uttered
a
jest
and
laughed
and
raising
the
cocoanut
bowls
buried
their
faces
and
quaffed
but
chiefly
in
silence
they
ate
and
soon
as
the
meal
was
done
rahéro
feigned
to
remember
and
measured
the
hour
by
the
sun
and
quoth
he
is
time
to
be
jogging
my
so
támatéa
arose
doing
ever
the
thing
he
was
bade
and
carelessly
shouldered
the
basket
and
kindly
saluted
his
host
and
again
the
way
of
his
going
was
round
by
the
roaring
coast
long
he
went
and
at
length
was
aware
of
a
pleasant
green
and
the
stems
and
shadows
of
palms
and
roofs
of
lodges
between
there
sate
in
the
door
of
his
palace
the
king
on
a
kingly
seat
and
aitos
stood
armed
around
and
the
yottowas
sat
at
his
feet
but
fear
was
a
worm
in
his
heart
fear
darted
his
eyes
and
he
probed
faces
for
treasons
and
pondered
their
speech
for
lies
to
him
came
támatéa
the
basket
slung
in
his
hand
and
paid
him
the
due
obeisance
standing
as
vassals
stand
in
silence
hearkened
the
king
and
closed
the
eyes
in
his
face
harbouring
odious
thoughts
and
the
baseless
fears
of
the
base
in
silence
accepted
the
gift
and
sent
the
giver
away
so
támatéa
departed
turning
his
back
on
the
day
and
lo
as
the
king
sat
brooding
a
rumour
rose
in
the
crowd
the
yottowas
nudged
and
whispered
the
commons
murmured
aloud
tittering
fell
upon
all
at
sight
of
the
impudent
thing
at
the
sight
of
a
gift
unroyal
flung
in
the
face
of
a
king
and
the
face
of
the
king
turned
white
and
red
with
anger
and
shame
in
their
midst
and
the
heart
in
his
body
was
water
and
then
was
flame
till
of
a
sudden
turning
he
gripped
an
aito
hard
a
youth
that
stood
with
his
ómare
one
of
the
daily
guard
and
spat
in
his
ear
a
command
and
pointed
and
uttered
a
name
and
hid
in
the
shade
of
the
house
his
impotent
anger
and
shame
now
támatéa
the
fool
was
far
on
the
homeward
way
the
rising
night
in
his
face
behind
him
the
dying
day
rahéro
saw
him
go
by
and
the
heart
of
rahéro
was
glad
devising
shame
to
the
king
and
nowise
harm
to
the
lad
and
all
that
dwelt
by
the
way
saw
and
saluted
him
well
for
he
had
the
face
of
a
friend
and
the
news
of
the
town
to
tell
and
pleased
with
the
notice
of
folk
and
pleased
that
his
journey
was
done
támatéa
drew
homeward
turning
his
back
to
the
sun
and
now
was
the
hour
of
the
bath
in
taiárapu
far
and
near
the
lovely
laughter
of
bathers
rose
and
delighted
his
ear
night
massed
in
the
valleys
the
sun
on
the
mountain
coast
struck
and
above
the
clouds
embattled
their
host
and
glowed
and
gloomed
on
the
heights
and
the
heads
of
the
palms
were
gems
and
far
to
the
rising
eve
extended
the
shade
of
their
stems
and
the
shadow
of
támatéa
hovered
already
at
home
and
sudden
the
sound
of
one
coming
and
running
light
as
the
foam
struck
on
his
ear
and
he
turned
and
lo
a
man
on
his
track
girded
and
armed
with
an
ómare
following
hard
at
his
back
at
a
bound
the
man
was
upon
him
or
ever
a
word
was
said
the
loaded
end
of
the
ómare
fell
and
laid
him
dead
ii
the
venging
of
támatéa
thus
was
treason
thus
and
no
further
it
sped
the
king
sat
safe
in
his
place
and
a
kindly
fool
was
dead
but
the
mother
of
támatéa
arose
with
death
in
her
eyes
all
night
long
and
the
next
taiárapu
rang
with
her
cries
as
when
a
babe
in
the
wood
turns
with
a
chill
of
doubt
and
perceives
nor
home
nor
friends
for
the
trees
have
closed
her
about
the
mountain
rings
and
her
breast
is
torn
with
the
voice
of
despair
so
the
woman
idly
wearied
the
air
for
awhile
and
pierced
hearing
in
vain
and
wounded
their
hearts
but
as
when
the
weather
changes
at
sea
in
dangerous
parts
and
sudden
the
hurricane
wrack
unrolls
up
the
front
of
the
sky
at
once
the
ship
lies
idle
the
sails
hang
silent
on
high
the
breath
of
the
wind
that
blew
is
blown
out
like
the
flame
of
a
lamp
and
the
silent
armies
of
death
draw
near
with
inaudible
tramp
so
sudden
the
voice
of
her
weeping
ceased
in
silence
she
rose
and
passed
from
the
house
of
her
sorrow
a
woman
clothed
with
repose
carrying
death
in
her
breast
and
sharpening
death
with
her
hand
hither
she
went
and
thither
in
all
the
coasts
of
the
land
they
tell
that
she
feared
not
to
slumber
alone
in
the
dead
of
night
in
accursed
places
beheld
unblenched
the
ribbon
of
light
spin
from
temple
to
temple
guided
the
perilous
skiff
abhorred
not
the
paths
of
the
mountain
and
trod
the
verge
of
the
cliff
from
end
to
end
of
the
island
thought
not
the
distance
long
but
forth
from
king
to
king
carried
the
tale
of
her
wrong
to
king
after
king
as
they
sat
in
the
palace
door
she
came
claiming
kinship
declaiming
verses
naming
her
name
and
the
names
of
all
of
her
fathers
and
still
with
a
heart
on
the
rack
jested
to
capture
a
hearing
and
laughed
when
they
jested
back
so
would
deceive
them
awhile
and
change
and
return
in
a
breath
and
on
all
the
men
of
vaiau
imprecate
instant
death
and
tempt
her
vaiau
was
a
rich
and
prosperous
land
and
who
would
attempt
it
but
warriors
mighty
of
hand
and
change
in
a
breath
again
and
rise
in
a
strain
of
song
invoking
the
beaten
drums
beholding
the
fall
of
the
strong
calling
the
fowls
of
the
air
to
come
and
feast
on
the
dead
and
they
held
the
chin
in
silence
and
heard
her
and
shook
the
head
for
they
knew
the
men
of
taiárapu
famous
in
battle
and
feast
marvellous
eaters
and
smiters
the
men
of
vaiau
not
least
to
the
land
of
the
to
paea
at
length
she
came
to
men
who
were
foes
to
the
tevas
and
hated
their
race
and
name
there
was
she
well
received
and
spoke
with
hiopa
the
king
and
hiopa
listened
and
weighed
and
wisely
considered
the
thing
in
the
back
of
the
isle
we
dwell
in
a
sheltered
place
quoth
he
to
the
woman
quiet
a
weak
and
peaceable
race
but
far
in
the
teeth
of
the
wind
lofty
taiárapu
lies
strong
blows
the
wind
of
the
trade
on
its
seaward
face
and
cries
aloud
in
the
top
of
arduous
mountains
and
utters
its
song
in
green
continuous
forests
strong
is
the
wind
and
strong
and
fruitful
and
hardy
the
race
famous
in
battle
and
feast
marvellous
eaters
and
smiters
the
men
of
vaiau
not
least
now
hearken
to
me
my
daughter
and
hear
a
word
of
the
wise
how
a
strength
goes
linked
with
a
weakness
two
by
two
like
the
eyes
they
can
wield
the
ómare
well
and
cast
the
javelin
far
yet
are
they
greedy
and
weak
as
the
swine
and
the
children
are
plant
we
then
here
at
paea
a
garden
of
excellent
fruits
plant
we
bananas
and
kava
and
taro
the
king
of
roots
let
the
pigs
in
paea
be
tapu
and
no
man
fish
for
a
year
and
of
all
the
meat
in
tahiti
gather
we
threefold
here
so
shall
the
fame
of
our
plenty
fill
the
island
and
so
at
last
on
the
tongue
of
rumour
go
where
we
wish
it
to
go
then
shall
the
pigs
of
taiárapu
raise
their
snouts
in
the
air
but
we
sit
quiet
and
wait
as
the
fowler
sits
by
the
snare
and
tranquilly
fold
our
hands
till
the
pigs
come
nosing
the
food
but
meanwhile
build
us
a
house
of
trotéa
the
stubborn
wood
bind
it
with
incombustible
thongs
set
a
roof
to
the
room
too
strong
for
the
hands
of
a
man
to
dissever
or
fire
to
consume
and
there
when
the
pigs
come
trotting
there
shall
the
feast
be
spread
there
shall
the
eye
of
the
morn
enlighten
the
feasters
dead
so
be
it
done
for
i
have
a
heart
that
pities
your
state
and
nateva
and
are
fire
and
water
for
all
was
done
as
he
said
and
the
gardens
prospered
and
now
the
fame
of
their
plenty
went
out
and
word
of
it
came
to
vaiau
for
the
men
of
sailed
to
the
windward
far
lay
in
the
offing
by
south
where
the
towns
of
the
tevas
are
and
cast
overboard
of
their
plenty
and
lo
at
the
tevas
feet
the
surf
on
all
of
the
beaches
tumbled
treasures
of
meat
in
the
salt
of
the
sea
a
harvest
tossed
with
the
refluent
foam
and
the
children
gleaned
it
in
playing
and
ate
and
carried
it
home
and
the
elders
stared
and
debated
and
wondered
and
passed
the
jest
but
whenever
a
guest
came
by
eagerly
questioned
the
guest
and
little
by
little
from
one
to
another
the
word
went
round
all
the
borders
of
paea
the
victual
rots
on
the
ground
and
swine
are
plenty
as
rats
and
now
when
they
fare
to
the
sea
the
men
of
the
glean
from
under
the
tree
and
load
the
canoe
to
the
gunwale
with
all
that
is
toothsome
to
eat
and
all
day
long
on
the
sea
the
jaws
are
crushing
the
meat
the
steersman
eats
at
the
helm
the
rowers
munch
at
the
oar
and
at
length
when
their
bellies
are
full
overboard
with
the
store
now
was
the
word
made
true
and
soon
as
the
bait
was
bare
all
the
pigs
of
taiárapu
raised
their
snouts
in
the
air
songs
were
recited
and
kinship
was
counted
and
tales
were
told
how
war
had
severed
of
late
but
peace
had
cemented
of
old
the
clans
of
the
island
war
said
they
set
we
an
end
and
hie
to
the
even
as
a
friend
to
a
so
judged
and
a
day
was
named
and
soon
as
the
morning
broke
canoes
were
thrust
in
the
sea
and
the
houses
emptied
of
folk
strong
blew
the
wind
of
the
south
the
wind
that
gathers
the
clan
along
all
the
line
of
the
reef
the
clamorous
surges
ran
and
the
clouds
were
piled
on
the
top
of
the
island
a
mountain
throned
on
a
mountain
the
fleet
of
canoes
swept
by
in
the
midst
on
the
green
lagoon
with
a
crew
released
from
care
sailing
an
even
water
breathing
a
summer
air
cheered
by
a
cloudless
sun
and
ever
to
left
and
right
bursting
surge
on
the
reef
drenching
storms
on
the
height
so
the
folk
of
vaiau
sailed
and
were
glad
all
day
coasting
the
cape
and
crossing
the
populous
bay
by
all
the
towns
of
the
tevas
and
still
as
they
bowled
along
boat
would
answer
to
boat
with
jest
and
laughter
and
song
and
the
people
of
all
the
towns
trooped
to
the
sides
of
the
sea
and
gazed
from
under
the
hand
or
sprang
aloft
on
the
tree
hailing
and
cheering
time
failed
them
for
more
to
do
the
holiday
village
careened
to
the
wind
and
was
gone
from
view
swift
as
a
passing
bird
and
ever
as
onward
it
bore
like
the
cry
of
the
passing
bird
bequeathed
its
song
to
the
desirable
laughter
of
maids
and
the
cry
of
delight
of
the
child
and
the
gazer
left
behind
stared
at
the
wake
and
smiled
by
all
the
towns
of
the
tevas
they
went
and
pápara
last
the
home
of
the
chief
the
place
of
muster
in
war
and
passed
the
march
of
the
lands
of
the
clan
to
the
lands
of
an
alien
folk
and
there
from
the
dusk
of
the
shoreside
palms
a
column
of
smoke
mounted
and
wavered
and
died
in
the
gold
of
the
setting
sun
they
cried
is
and
so
was
the
voyage
done
in
the
early
fall
of
the
night
hiopa
came
to
the
shore
and
beheld
and
counted
the
comers
and
lo
they
were
forty
score
the
pelting
feet
of
the
babes
that
ran
already
and
played
the
smile
of
the
boy
the
slender
breasts
of
the
maid
and
mighty
limbs
of
women
stalwart
mothers
of
men
the
sires
stood
forth
unabashed
but
a
little
back
from
his
ken
clustered
the
scarcely
nubile
the
lads
and
maids
in
a
ring
fain
of
each
other
afraid
of
themselves
aware
of
the
king
and
aping
behaviour
but
clinging
together
with
hands
and
eyes
with
looks
that
were
kind
like
kisses
and
laughter
tender
as
sighs
there
too
the
grandsire
stood
raising
his
silver
crest
and
the
impotent
hands
of
a
suckling
groped
in
his
barren
breast
the
childhood
of
love
the
pair
well
married
the
innocent
brood
the
tale
of
the
generations
repeated
and
ever
hiopa
beheld
them
together
all
the
ages
of
man
and
a
moment
shook
in
his
purpose
but
these
were
the
foes
of
his
clan
and
he
trod
upon
pity
and
came
and
civilly
greeted
the
king
and
gravely
entreated
rahéro
and
for
all
that
could
fight
or
sing
and
claimed
a
name
in
the
land
had
fitting
phrases
of
praise
but
with
all
who
were
he
spoke
of
the
ancient
days
and
true
said
he
in
paea
the
victual
rots
on
the
ground
but
friends
your
number
is
many
and
pigs
must
be
hunted
and
found
and
the
lads
troop
to
the
mountains
to
bring
the
féis
down
and
around
the
bowls
of
the
kava
cluster
the
maids
of
the
town
so
for
sleep
here
but
king
common
and
priest
in
order
due
shall
sit
with
me
in
the
sleepless
the
night
followers
toiled
the
pigs
screamed
and
were
slaughtered
the
spars
of
the
oiled
the
leaves
spread
on
the
floor
in
many
a
mountain
glen
the
moon
drew
shadows
of
trees
on
the
naked
bodies
of
men
plucking
and
bearing
fruits
and
in
all
the
bounds
of
the
town
red
glowed
the
cocoanut
fires
and
were
buried
and
trodden
down
thus
did
seven
of
the
yottowas
toil
with
their
tale
of
the
clan
but
the
eighth
wrought
with
his
lads
hid
from
the
sight
of
man
in
the
deeps
of
the
woods
they
laboured
piling
the
fuel
high
in
fagots
the
load
of
a
man
fuel
seasoned
and
dry
thirsty
to
seize
upon
fire
and
apt
to
blurt
into
flame
and
now
was
the
day
of
the
feast
the
forests
as
morning
came
tossed
in
the
wind
and
the
peaks
quaked
in
the
blaze
of
the
day
and
the
cocoanuts
showered
on
the
ground
rebounding
and
rolling
away
a
glorious
morn
for
a
feast
a
famous
wind
for
a
fire
to
the
hall
of
feasting
hiopa
led
them
mother
and
sire
and
maid
and
babe
in
a
tale
the
whole
of
the
holiday
throng
smiling
they
came
garlanded
green
not
dreaming
of
wrong
and
for
every
three
a
pig
tenderly
cooked
in
the
ground
waited
and
féi
the
staff
of
life
heaped
in
a
mound
for
each
where
he
sat
each
bananas
roasted
and
raw
piled
with
a
bountiful
hand
as
for
horses
hay
and
straw
are
stacked
in
a
stable
and
fish
the
food
of
desire
and
plentiful
vessels
of
sauce
and
breadfruit
gilt
in
the
fire
and
kava
was
common
as
water
feasts
have
there
been
ere
now
and
many
but
never
a
feast
like
that
of
the
folk
of
vaiau
all
day
long
they
ate
with
the
resolute
greed
of
brutes
and
turned
from
the
pigs
to
the
fish
and
again
from
the
fish
to
the
fruits
and
emptied
the
vessels
of
sauce
and
drank
of
the
kava
deep
till
the
young
lay
stupid
as
stones
and
the
strongest
nodded
to
sleep
sleep
that
was
mighty
as
death
and
blind
as
a
moonless
night
tethered
them
hand
and
foot
and
their
souls
were
drowned
and
the
light
was
cloaked
from
their
eyes
senseless
together
the
old
and
the
young
the
fighter
deadly
to
smite
and
the
prater
cunning
of
tongue
the
woman
wedded
and
fruitful
inured
to
the
pangs
of
birth
and
the
maid
that
knew
not
of
kisses
blindly
sprawled
on
the
earth
from
the
hall
hiopa
the
king
and
his
chiefs
came
stealthily
forth
already
the
sun
hung
low
and
enlightened
the
peaks
of
the
north
but
the
wind
was
stubborn
to
die
and
blew
as
it
blows
at
morn
showering
the
nuts
in
the
dusk
and
as
a
banner
is
torn
high
on
the
peaks
of
the
island
shattered
the
mountain
cloud
and
now
at
once
at
a
signal
a
silent
emulous
crowd
set
hands
to
the
work
of
death
hurrying
to
and
fro
like
ants
to
furnish
the
fagots
building
them
broad
and
low
and
piling
them
high
and
higher
around
the
walls
of
the
hall
silence
persisted
within
for
sleep
lay
heavy
on
all
but
the
mother
of
támatéa
stood
at
side
and
shook
for
terror
and
joy
like
a
girl
that
is
a
bride
night
fell
on
the
toilers
and
first
hiopa
the
wise
made
the
round
of
the
house
visiting
all
with
his
eyes
and
all
was
piled
to
the
eaves
and
fuel
blockaded
the
door
and
within
in
the
house
beleaguered
slumbered
the
forty
score
then
was
an
aito
dispatched
and
came
with
fire
in
his
hand
and
hiopa
took
said
he
the
life
of
a
land
and
behold
i
breathe
on
the
coal
i
breathe
on
the
dales
of
the
east
and
silence
falls
on
forest
and
shore
the
voice
of
the
feast
is
quenched
and
the
smoke
of
cooking
the
rooftree
decays
and
falls
on
the
empty
lodge
and
the
winds
subvert
deserted
therewithal
to
the
fuel
he
laid
the
glowing
coal
and
the
redness
ran
in
the
mass
and
burrowed
within
like
a
mole
and
copious
smoke
was
conceived
but
as
when
a
dam
is
to
burst
the
water
lips
it
and
crosses
in
silver
trickles
at
first
and
then
of
a
sudden
whelms
and
bears
it
away
forthright
so
now
in
a
moment
the
flame
sprang
and
towered
in
the
night
and
wrestled
and
roared
in
the
wind
and
high
over
house
and
tree
stood
like
a
streaming
torch
enlightening
land
and
sea
but
the
mother
of
támatéa
threw
her
arms
abroad
of
my
son
she
shouted
vengeance
of
god
late
late
i
behold
you
yet
i
behold
you
at
last
and
glory
beholding
for
now
are
the
days
of
my
agony
past
the
lust
that
famished
my
soul
now
eats
and
drinks
its
desire
and
they
that
encompassed
my
son
shrivel
alive
in
the
fire
tenfold
precious
the
vengeance
that
comes
after
lingering
years
ye
quenched
the
voice
of
my
singer
in
your
dying
ears
the
song
of
the
conflagration
ye
left
me
a
widow
alone
the
whole
of
your
race
consumes
sinew
and
bone
and
torturing
flesh
together
man
mother
and
maid
heaped
in
a
common
shambles
and
already
borne
by
the
trade
the
smoke
of
your
dissolution
darkens
the
stars
of
thus
she
spoke
and
her
stature
grew
in
the
sight
iii
rahéro
rahéro
was
there
in
the
hall
asleep
beside
him
his
wife
comely
a
mirthful
woman
one
that
delighted
in
life
and
a
girl
that
was
ripe
for
marriage
shy
and
sly
as
a
mouse
and
a
boy
a
climber
of
trees
all
the
hopes
of
his
house
unwary
with
open
hands
he
slept
in
the
midst
of
his
folk
and
dreamed
that
he
heard
a
voice
crying
without
and
awoke
leaping
blindly
afoot
like
one
from
a
dream
that
he
fears
a
hellish
glow
and
clouds
were
about
him
roared
in
his
ears
like
the
sound
of
the
cataract
fall
that
plunges
sudden
and
steep
and
rahéro
swayed
as
he
stood
and
his
reason
was
still
asleep
now
the
flame
struck
hard
on
the
house
a
fracturing
blow
and
the
end
of
the
roof
was
burst
and
fell
on
the
sleepers
below
and
the
lofty
hall
and
the
feast
and
the
prostrate
bodies
of
folk
shone
red
in
his
eyes
a
moment
and
then
were
swallowed
of
smoke
in
the
mind
of
rahéro
clearness
came
and
he
opened
his
throat
and
as
when
a
squall
comes
sudden
the
straining
sail
of
a
boat
thunders
aloud
and
bursts
so
thundered
the
voice
of
the
man
wind
and
the
rain
he
shouted
the
mustering
word
of
the
clan
and
and
arms
men
of
vaiau
but
silence
replied
or
only
the
voice
of
the
gusts
of
the
fire
and
nothing
beside
rahéro
stooped
and
groped
he
handled
his
womankind
but
the
fumes
of
the
fire
and
the
kava
had
quenched
the
life
of
their
mind
and
they
lay
like
pillars
prone
and
his
hand
encountered
the
boy
and
there
sprang
in
the
gloom
of
his
soul
a
sudden
lightning
of
joy
can
i
save
he
thought
i
were
speedy
and
he
loosened
the
cloth
from
his
loins
and
swaddled
the
child
in
the
stuff
and
about
the
strength
of
his
neck
he
knotted
the
burden
well
there
where
the
roof
had
fallen
it
roared
like
the
mouth
of
hell
thither
rahéro
went
stumbling
on
senseless
folk
and
grappled
a
post
of
the
house
and
began
to
climb
in
the
smoke
the
last
alive
of
vaiau
and
the
son
borne
by
the
sire
the
post
glowed
in
the
grain
with
ulcers
of
eating
fire
and
the
fire
bit
to
the
blood
and
mangled
his
hands
and
thighs
and
the
fumes
sang
in
his
head
like
wine
and
stung
in
his
eyes
and
still
he
climbed
and
came
to
the

of
proof
and
thrust
a
hand
through

flame
and
clambered
alive
on
the
roof
but
even
as
he
did
so
the
wind
in
a
garment
of
flames
and
pain
wrapped
him
from
head
to
heel
and
the
waistcloth
parted
in
twain
and
the
living
fruit
of
his
loins
dropped
in
the
fire
below
about
the
blazing
clustered
the
eyes
of
the
foe
watching
hand
upon
weapon
lest
ever
a
soul
should
flee
shading
the
brow
from
the
glare
straining
the
neck
to
see
only
to

the
flames
in
the
wind
swept
far
and
wide
and
the
forest
sputtered
on
fire
and
there
might
no
man
abide
thither
rahéro
crept
and
dropped
from
the
burning
eaves
and
crouching
low
to
the
ground
in
a
treble
covert
of
leaves
and
fire
and
volleying
smoke
ran
for
the
life
of
his
soul
unseen
and
behind
him
under
a
furnace
of
ardent
coal
cairned
with
a
wonder
of
flame
and
blotting
the
night
with
smoke
blazed
and
were
smelted
together
the
bones
of
all
his
folk
he
fled
unguided
at
first
but
hearing
the
breakers
roar
thitherward
shaped
his
way
and
came
at
length
to
the
shore
he
was
but
smarted
in
every
part
and
the
mighty
cage
of
his
ribs
heaved
on
his
straining
heart
with
sorrow
and
rage
and
he
cried
of
vaiau
heads
of
and
where
are
they
now
those
that
i
played
with
those
that
nursed
me
those
that
i
nursed
god
and
i
outliving
them
i
the
least
and
the
i
that
thought
myself
crafty
snared
by
this
herd
of
swine
in
the
tortures
of
hell
and
desolate
stripped
of
all
that
was
mine
all
friends
and
my
silver
heads
of
yore
that
trooped
to
the
council
the
children
that
ran
to
the
open
door
crying
with
innocent
voices
and
clasping
a
knees
and
mine
my
sturdy
climber
of
trees
ah
never
to
climb
again
thus
in
the
dusk
of
the
night
for
clouds
rolled
in
the
sky
and
the
moon
was
swallowed
from
sight
pacing
and
gnawing
his
fists
rahéro
raged
by
the
shore
vengeance
that
must
be
his
but
much
was
to
do
before
and
first
a
single
life
to
be
snatched
from
a
deadly
place
a
life
the
root
of
revenge
surviving
plant
of
the
race
and
next
the
race
to
be
raised
anew
and
the
lands
of
the
clan
repeopled
so
rahéro
designed
a
prudent
man
even
in
wrath
and
turned
for
the
means
of
revenge
and
escape
a
boat
to
be
seized
by
stealth
a
wife
to
be
taken
by
rape
still
was
the
dark
lagoon
beyond
on
the
coral
wall
he
saw
the
breakers
shine
he
heard
them
bellow
and
fall
alone
on
the
top
of
the
reef
a
man
with
a
flaming
brand
walked
gazing
and
pausing
a
poised
in
his
hand
the
foam
boiled
to
his
calf
when
the
mightier
breakers
came
and
the
torch
shed
in
the
wind
scattering
tufts
of
flame
afar
on
the
dark
lagoon
a
canoe
lay
idly
at
wait
a
figure
dimly
guiding
it
surely
the
mate
rahéro
saw
and
he
smiled
he
straightened
his
mighty
thews
naked
with
never
a
weapon
and
covered
with
scorch
and
bruise
he
straightened
his
arms
he
filled
the
void
of
his
body
with
breath
and
strong
as
the
wind
in
his
manhood
doomed
the
fisher
to
death
silent
he
entered
the
water
and
silently
swam
and
came
there
where
the
fisher
walked
holding
on
high
the
flame
loud
on
the
pier
of
the
reef
volleyed
the
breach
of
the
sea
and
hard
at
the
back
of
the
man
rahéro
crept
to
his
knee
on
the
coral
and
suddenly
sprang
and
seized
him
the
elder
hand
clutching
the
joint
of
his
throat
the
other
snatching
the
brand
ere
it
had
time
to
fall
and
holding
it
steady
and
high
strong
was
the
fisher
brave
and
swift
of
mind
and
of
strongly
he
threw
in
the
clutch
but
rahéro
resisted
the
strain
and
jerked
and
the
spine
of
life
snapped
with
a
crack
in
twain
and
the
man
came
slack
in
his
hands
and
tumbled
a
lump
at
his
feet
one
moment
and
there
on
the
reef
where
the
breakers
whitened
and
beat
rahéro
was
standing
alone
glowing
and
scorched
and
bare
a
victor
unknown
of
any
raising
the
torch
in
the
air
but
once
he
drank
of
his
breath
and
instantly
set
him
to
fish
like
a
man
intent
upon
supper
at
home
and
a
savoury
dish
for
what
should
the
woman
have
seen
a
man
with
a
then
a
blur
of
the
a
man
with
a
torch
again
and
the
torch
had
scarcely
been
shaken
surely
rahéro
said
will
deem
it
a
trick
of
the
eyes
a
fancy
born
in
the
head
but
time
must
be
given
the
fool
to
nourish
a
so
for
a
while
a
sedulous
fisher
he
walked
the
reef
pausing
at
times
and
gazing
striking
at
times
with
the
spear
uttered
the
call
and
even
as
the
boat
drew
near
like
a
man
that
was
done
with
its
use
tossed
the
torch
in
the
sea
lightly
he
leaped
on
the
boat
beside
the
woman
and
she
lightly
addressed
him
and
yielded
the
paddle
and
place
to
sit
for
now
the
torch
was
extinguished
the
night
was
black
as
the
pit
rahéro
set
him
to
row
never
a
word
he
spoke
and
the
boat
sang
in
the
water
urged
by
his
vigorous
stroke
ails
you
the
woman
asked
why
did
you
drop
the
brand
we
have
only
to
kindle
another
as
soon
as
we
come
to
never
a
word
rahéro
replied
but
urged
the
canoe
and
a
chill
fell
on
the
speak
is
it
you
speak
why
are
you
silent
why
do
you
bend
aside
wherefore
steer
to
the
seaward
thus
she
panted
and
cried
never
a
word
from
the
oarsman
toiling
there
in
the
dark
but
right
for
a
gate
of
the
reef
he
silently
headed
the
bark
and
wielding
the
single
paddle
with
passionate
sweep
on
sweep
drove
her
the
little
fitted
forth
on
the
open
deep
and
fear
there
where
she
sat
froze
the
woman
to
stone
not
fear
of
the
crazy
boat
and
the
weltering
deep
alone
but
a
keener
fear
of
the
night
the
dark
and
the
ghostly
hour
and
the
thing
that
drove
the
canoe
with
more
than
a
power
and
more
than
a
boldness
for
much
she
knew
of
the
dead
that
haunt
and
fish
upon
reefs
toiling
like
men
for
bread
and
traffic
with
human
fishers
or
slay
them
and
take
their
ware
till
the
hour
when
the
star
of
the
dead
goes
down
and
the
morning
air
blows
and
the
cocks
are
singing
on
shore
and
surely
she
knew
the
speechless
thing
at
her
side
belonged
to
the
grave
it
blew
all
night
from
the
south
all
night
rahéro
contended
and
kept
the
prow
to
the
cresting
sea
and
silent
as
though
she
slept
the
woman
huddled
and
quaked
and
now
was
the
peep
of
day

and
long
on
their
left

mountainous
island
lay
and
over

returned
to
the
covered
grave
and
here
on
the
sea
the
woman
waxing
suddenly
brave
turned
her
swiftly
about
and
looked
in
the
face
of
the
man
and
sure
he
was
none
that
she
knew
none
of
her
country

clan
a
stranger
and
marred
with
the
marks
of
fire
but
comely
and
great
of
stature

obey

clan
went
forth
to
bathe
in
the
dusk
a
word
that
began
to
go
round
a
word
a
whisper
a
start
hope
that
leaped
in
the
bosom
fear
that
knocked
on
the
heart
the
priest
is
not
for
his
door
is
fast
he
is
going
to
name
the
victims
he
is
going
to
help
us
at
thrice
rose
the
sun
to
noon
and
ever
like
one
of
the
dead
the
priest
lay
still
in
his
house
with
the
roar
of
the
sea
in
his
head
there
was
never
a
foot
on
the
floor
there
was
never
a
whisper
of
speech
only
the
leering
tikis
stared
on
the
blinding
beach
again
were
the
mountains
fired
again
the
morning
broke
and
all
the
houses
lay
still
but
the
house
of
the
priest
awoke
close
in
their
covering
roofs
lay
and
trembled
the
clan
but
the
agèd
priest
ran
forth
like
a
lunatic
man
and
the
village
panted
to
see
him
in
the
jewels
of
death
again
in
the
silver
beards
of
the
old
and
the
hair
of
women
slain
frenzy
shook
in
his
limbs
frenzy
shone
in
his
eyes
and
still
and
again
as
he
ran
the
valley
rang
with
his
cries
all
day
long
in
the
land
by
cliff
and
thicket
and
den
he
ran
his
lunatic
rounds
and
howled
for
the
flesh
of
men
all
day
long
he
ate
not
nor
ever
drank
of
the
brook
and
all
day
long
in
their
houses
the
people
listened
and
all
day
long
in
their
houses
they
listened
with
bated
breath
and
never
a
soul
went
forth
for
the
sight
of
the
priest
was
death
three
were
the
days
of
his
running
as
the
gods
appointed
of
yore
two
the
nights
of
his
sleeping
alone
in
the
place
of
gore
the
drunken
slumber
of
frenzy
twice
he
drank
to
the
lees
on
the
sacred
stones
of
the
under
the
sacred
trees
with
a
lamp
at
his
ashen
head
he
lay
in
the
place
of
the
feast
and
the
sacred
leaves
of
the
banyan
rustled
around
the
priest
last
when
the
stated
even
fell
upon
terrace
and
tree
and
the
shade
of
the
lofty
island
lay
leagues
away
to
sea
and
all
the
valleys
of
verdure
were
heavy
with
manna
and
musk
the
wreck
of
the
priest
came
gasping
home
in
the
dusk
he
reeled
across
the
village
he
staggered
along
the
shore
and
between
the
leering
tikis
crept
groping
through
his
door
there
went
a
stir
through
the
lodges
the
voice
of
speech
awoke
once
more
from
the
builded
platforms
arose
the
evening
smoke
and
those
who
were
mighty
in
war
and
those
renowned
for
an
art
sat
in
their
stated
seats
and
talked
of
the
morrow
apart

the
lovers

away

the
the
ears
of

stealthily
quietly

the

dawn
as
yellow
as
sulphur
leaped
on
the
naked
peak
and
all
the
village
was
stirring
for
now
was
the
priest
to
speak
forth
on
his
terrace
he
came
and
sat
with
the
chief
in
talk
his
lips
were
blackened
with
fever
his
cheeks
were
whiter
than
chalk
fever
clutched
at
his
hands
fever
nodded
his
head
but
quiet
and
steady
and
cruel
his
eyes
shone
in
the
earliest
rays
of
the
sun
the
chief
rose
up
content
braves
were
summoned
and
drummers
messengers
came
and
went
braves
ran
to
their
lodges
weapons
were
snatched
from
the
wall
the
commons
herded
together
and
fear
was
over
them
all
festival
dresses
they
wore
but
the
tongue
was
dry
in
their
mouth
and
the
blinking
eyes
in
their
faces
skirted
from
north
to
south
now
to
the
sacred
enclosure
gathered
the
greatest
and
least
and
from
under
the
shade
of
the
banyan
arose
the
voice
of
the
feast
the
frenzied
roll
of
the
drum
and
a
swift
monotonous
song
higher
the
sun
swam
up
the
trade
wind
level
and
strong
awoke
in
the
tops
of
the
palms
and
rattled
the
fans
aloud
and
over
the
garlanded
heads
and
shining
robes
of
the
crowd
tossed
the
spiders
of
shadow
scattered
the
jewels
of
sun
forty
the
tale
of
the
drums
and
the
forty
throbbed
like
one
a
thousand
hearts
in
the
crowd
and
the
even
chorus
of
song
swift
as
the
feet
of
a
runner
trampled
a
thousand
strong
and
the
old
men
leered
at
the
ovens
and
licked
their
lips
for
the
food
and
the
women
stared
at
the
lads
and
laughed
and
looked
to
the
wood
as
when
the
sweltering
baker
at
night
when
the
city
is
dead
alone
in
the
trough
of
labour
treads
and
fashions
the
bread
so
in
the
heat
and
the
reek
and
the
touch
of
woman
and
man
the
naked
spirit
of
evil
kneaded
the
hearts
of
the
clan
now
cold
was
at
many
a
heart
and
shaking
in
many
a
seat
for
there
were
the
empty
baskets
but
who
was
to
furnish
the
meat
for
here
was
the
nation
assembled
and
there
were
the
ovens
anigh
and
out
of
a
thousand
singers
nine
were
numbered
to
die
till
of
a
sudden
a
shock
a
mace
in
the
air
a
yell
and
struck
in
the
edge
of
the
crowd
the
first
of
the
victims
fell
terror
and
horrible
glee
divided
the
shrinking
clan
terror
of
what
was
to
follow
glee
for
a
diet
of
man
frenzy
hurried
the
chaunt
frenzy
rattled
the
drums
the
nobles
high
on
the
terrace
greedily
mouthed
their
thumbs
and
once
and
again
and
again
in
the
ignorant
crowd
below
once
and
again
and
again
descended
the
murderous
blow
now
smoked
the
oven
and
now
with
the
cutting
lip
of
a
shell
a
butcher
of
ninety
winters
jointed
the
bodies
well
unto
the
carven
lodge
silent
in
order
due
the
grandees
of
the
nation
one
after
one
withdrew
and
a
line
of
laden
bearers
brought
to
the
terrace

on
poles
across
their
shoulders
the
last
reserve
of
fruit
the
victims
bled
for
the
nobles
in
the
old
appointed
way
the
fruit
was
spread
for
the
commons
for
all

now

the
kava
brewed
and
now
the
cocoa
ran
now
was
the
hour
of
the
dance
for
child

mirth
was
in

a
garland
on

all
was
well
with

well
with
the
eight
who
were
dead

the

there
in

clustered
contorted
trees

the
silver
beard
of
a
stream
hung
and
swung
in
the
breeze
high
overhead
with

the
torrents

for

and
silently
sprinkled
below

rain

staring
noon

damp
and
cold

the

the
face

green
here
in
the
rocky
pit
accursed
already
of
old
on
a
stone
in
the
midst
of
a
river
rua
sat
and
was
cold
of
shadows
valley
of
silent
falls
rua
sang
and
his
voice
went
hollow
about
the
walls
of
shadow
and
rock
a
doleful
prison
to
me
what
is
the
life
you
can
give
to
a
child
of
the
sun
and
the
sea
and
rua
arose
and
came
to
the
open
mouth
of
the
glen
whence
he
beheld
the
woods
and
the
sea
and
houses
of
men
wide
blew
the
riotous
trade
and
smelt
in
his
nostrils
good
it
bowed
the
boats
on
the
bay
and
tore
and
divided
the
wood
it
smote
and
sundered
the
groves
as
moses
smote
with
the
rod
and
the
streamers
of
all
the
trees
blew
like
banners
abroad
and
ever
and
on
in
a
lull
the
trade
wind
brought
him
along
a
patter
of
drums
and
a
whisper
of
song
swift
as
the
wings
the
diligent
hands
on
the
drum
fluttered
and
hurried
and
throbbed
woe
that
i
hear
you
come
rua
cried
in
his
grief
sorrowful
sound
to
me
mounting
far
and
faint
from
the
resonant
shore
of
the
sea
woe
in
the
song
for
the
grave
breathes
in
the
breath
and
i
hear
in
the
tramp
of
the
drums
the
beat
of
the
heart
of
death
home
of
my
youth
no
more
through
all
the
length
of
the
years
no
more
to
the
place
of
the
echoes
of
early
laughter
and
tears
no
more

rua
return
no
more
as
the
evening
ends
to
crowded
eyes
of
welcome
to
the
reaching
hands
of
all
day
long
from
the
the
drums
and
the
singing
came
and
the
even
fell
and
the
sun
went
down
a
wheel
of
flame
and
night
came
gleaning
the
shadows
and
hushing
the
sounds
of
the
wood
and
silence
slept
on
all
where
rua
sorrowed
and
stood
but
still
from
the
shore
of
the
bay
the
sound
of
the
festival
rang
and
still
the
crowd
in
the
danced
and
shouted
and
sang
now
over
all
the
isle
terror
was
breathed
abroad
of
shadowy
hands
from
the
trees
and
shadowy
snares
in
the
sod
and
before
the
nostrils
of
night
the
shuddering
hunter
of
men
hurried
with
beard
on
shoulder
back
to
his
lighted
den
here
to
my
side
my
rua
you
and
cold
from
the
clutch
of
terror
cold
with
the
damp
of
the
dew
taheia
heavy
of
hair
leaped
through
the
dark
to
his
arms
taheia
leaped
to
his
clasp
and

folded

from
alarms

what
your
love

brought
as
the
shuttle

returning

the
beaten

voice
in
the
shine
of
many
torches
must
the
sleepless
clan
rejoice
and
taheia
the
the
daughter
of
chief
and
priest
taheia
must
sit
in
her
place
in
the
crowded
bench
of
the
so
it
was
spoken
and
she
girding
her
garment
high
fled
and
was
swallowed
of
woods
swift
as
the
sight
of
an
eye
night
over
isle
and
sea
rolled
her
curtain
of
stars
then
a
trouble
awoke
in
the
air
the
east
was
banded
with
bars
dawn
as
yellow
as
sulphur
leaped
on
the
mountain
height
dawn
in
the
deepest
glen
fell
a
wonder
of
light
high
and
clear
stood
the
palms
in
the
eye
of
the
brightening
east
and
lo
from
the
sides
of
the
sea
the
broken
sound
of
the
feast
as
when
in
days
of
summer
through
open
windows
the
fly
swift
as
a
breeze
and
loud
as
a
trump
goes
by
but
when
frosts
in
the
field
have
pinched
the
wintering
mouse
blindly
noses
and
buzzes
and
hums
in
the
firelit
house
so
the
sound
of
the
feast
gallantly
trampled
at
night
so
it
staggered
and
drooped
and
droned
in
the
morning
light
iv
the
raid
it
chanced
that
as
rua
sat
in
the
valley
of
silent
falls
he
heard
a
calling
of
doves
from
high
on
the
cliffy
walls
fire
had
fashioned
of
yore
and
time
had
broken
the
rocks
there
were
rooting
crannies
for
trees
and
for
flocks
and
he
saw
on
the
top
of
the
cliffs
looking
up
from
the
pit
of
the
shade
a
flicker
of
wings
and
sunshine
and
trees
that
swung
in
the
trade
trees
swing
in
the
trade
quoth
rua
doubtful
of
words
the
sun
stares
from
the
sky
but
what
should
trouble
the
birds
up
from
the
shade
he
gazed
where
high
the
parapet
shone
and
he
was
aware
of
a
ledge
and
of
things
that
moved
thereon
manner
of
things
are
these
are
they
spirits
abroad
by
day
or
the
foes
of
my
clan
that
are
come
bringing
death
by
a
perilous
way
the
valley
was
gouged
like
a
vessel
and
round
like
the
lip
with
a
cape
of
the
side
of
the
hill
thrust
forth
like
the
bows
of
a
ship
on
the
top
of
the
face
of
the
cape
a
volley
of
sun
struck
fair
and
the
cape
overhung
like
a
chin
a
gulph
of
sunless
air
heart
what
is
that
that
flickered
and
shone
into
the
sun
for
an
instant
and
in
an
instant
gone
was
it
a
plume
a
girdle
of
hair
swung
in
the
loop
of
a
rope
is
he
making
a
bridge
of
the
air
once
and
again
rua
saw
in
the
trenchant
edge
of
the
sky
the
giddy
conjuring
done
and
then
in
the
blink
of
an
eye
a
scream
caught
in
with
the
breath
a
whirling
packet
of
limbs
a
lump
that
dived
in
the
gulph
more
swift
than
a
dolphin
swims
and
there
was
the
lump
at
his
feet
and
eyes
were
alive
in
the
lump
sick
was
the
soul
of
rua
ambushed
close
in
a
clump
sick
of
soul
he
drew
near
making
his
courage
stout
and
he
looked
in
the
face
of
the
thing
and
the
life
of
the
thing
went
out
and
he
gazed
on
the
tattooed
limbs
and
behold
he
knew
the
man
hoka
a
chief
of
the
vais
the
truculent
foe
of
his
clan
hoka
a
moment
since
that
stepped
in
the
loop
of
the
rope
filled
with
the
lust
of
war
and
alive
with
courage
and
hope
again
to
the
giddy
cornice
rua
lifted
his
eyes
and
again
beheld
men
passing
in
the
armpit
of

leaping
from

as

at

flits
through
resonant

and
skims
by

and
rua
burst
from
the
glen
and
leaped
on
the
shore
of
the
brook
and
straight
for
the
roofs
of
the
clan
his
vigorous
way
he
took
swift
were
the
heels
of
his
flight
and
loud
behind
as
he
went
rattled
the
leaping
stones
on
the
line
of
his
long
descent
and
ever
he
thought
as

caught
at

gasping
breath

fool
of

with

scattered

stared
at

with
a
bestial
droop
of

rheum
in

as

on

a
cluster

folk
sat
by

nor
raised
their
serious
eyes
nor
spoke
women
with
robes
unruffled
and
garlands
duly
arranged
gazing
far
from

he
uttered
a
summoning
shout
and
called
on
the
clan
to
rise
over
against
him
at
once
in
the
spotted
shade
of
the
trees
owlish
and
blinking
creatures
scrambled
to
hands
and
knees
on
the
grades
of
the
sacred
terrace
the
driveller
woke
to
fear
and
the
hand
of
the
warrior
brandished
a
wavering
spear

folded
his
arms

discovered
his
teeth
above

autumn

around

leaped
from

place

the
priest
the
ran
to
the
front
of
the
terrace
and
brandished
his
arms
and
cried
o

the
love
of

heart

of

striking
particularities
of

rests
upon
no

it
is
in
no
sense
like
a
native
story
but
a
patchwork
of
details
of
manners
and
the
impressions
of
a
traveller
it
may
seem
strange
when
the
scene
is
laid
upon
these
profligate
islands
to
make
the
story
hinge
on
love
but
love
is
not
less
known
in
the
marquesas
than
elsewhere
nor
is
there
any
cause

suicide

of

heathery
hills
in
the
days
of
the

the
fight
by
the
sides
of
the
rainy
sea
where
never
a
stranger
came
on
the
awful
lips
of
the
dead
he
heard
the
outlandish
name
it
sang
in
his
sleeping
ears
it
hummed
in
his
waking
head
the
the
utterance
of

counselled
of
high

low
degree
with
the
herdsmen
on
the
mountains

the
fishers
of
the
sea

he
came

went
unweary

read
the
books
of
yore
and
the
runes
that
were
written
of
old
on
stones
upon
the
moor

many
a
name
he
was
told

never
the
name

his
never
in

west
the
name
that
rang
in
his
ears

of
men
and
of
clans

for
the
grass

the
smallest
tarn

land
of
scotland
never
a
name
like
that
ii
the
seeking
of
the
name
and
now
there
was
speech
in
the
south
and
a
man
of
the
south
that
was
wise
a
lord
of
london
called
on
the
clans
to
rise
and
the
riders
rode
and
the
summons
came
to
the
western
shore
to
the
land
of
the
sea
and
the
heather
to
appin
and
mamore
it
called
on
all
to
gather
from
every
scrog
and
scaur
that
loved
their
tartan
and
the
ancient
game
of
war
and
down
the
watery
valley
and
up
the
windy
hill
once
more
as
in
the
olden
the
pipes
were
sounding
shrill
again
in
highland
sunshine
the
naked
steel
was
bright
and
the
lads
once
more
in
tartan
went
forth
again
to
fight
why
should
i
dwell
here
with
a
weird
upon
my
life
when
the
clansmen
shout
for
battle
and
the
clash
in
strife
i
cannae
joy
at
feast
i
cannae
sleep
in
bed
for
the
wonder
of
the
word
and
the
warning
of
the
dead
it
sings
in
my
sleeping
ears
it
hums
in
my
waking
head
the
the
utterance
of
the
dead
then
up
and
with
the
fighting
men
to
march
away
from
here
till
the
cry
of
the
great
shall
drown
it
in
my
ear
where
flew
king
ensign
the
plaided
soldiers
went
they
drew
the
sword
in
germany
in
flanders
pitched
the
tent
the
bells
of
foreign
cities
rang
far
across
the
plain
they
passed
the
happy
rhine
they
drank
the
rapid
main
through
asiatic
jungles
the
tartans
filed
their
way
and
the
neighing
of
the
struck
terror
in
cathay
a
name
have
i
heard
he
thought
all
the
tongues
of
men
full
many
a
name
both
here
and
there
full
many
both
now
and
then
when
i
was
at
home
in
my
house
in
the
land
of
the
naked
knee
between
the
eagles
that
fly
in
the
lift
and
the
herrings
that
swim
in
the
sea
and
now
that
i
am
a
with
a
braw
cockade
in
my
many
a
name
have
i
heard
he
thought
never
a
name
like
iii
the
place
of
the
name
there
fell
a
war
in
a
woody
place
lay
far
across
the
sea
a
war
of
the
march
in
the
mirk
midnight
and
the
shot
from
behind
the
tree
the
shaven
head
and
the
painted
face
the
silent
foot
in
the
wood
in
a
land
of
a
strange
outlandish
tongue
that
was
hard
to
be
understood
it
fell
about
the
gloaming
the
general
stood
with
his
staff
he
stood
and
he
looked
east
and
west
with
little
mind
to
laugh
have
i
been
and
much
have
i
seen
and
kent
both
gain
and
loss
but
here
we
have
woods
on
every
hand
and
a
kittle
water
to
cross
far
have
i
been
and
much
have
i
seen
but
never
the
beat
of
this
and
one
must
go
down
to
that
waterside
to
see
how
deep
it
it
fell
in
the
dusk
of
the
night
when
unco
things
betide
the
skilly
captain
the
cameron
went
down
to
that
waterside
canny
and
soft
the
captain
went
and
a
man
of
the
woody
land
with
the
shaven
head
and
the
painted
face
went
down
at
his
right
hand
it
fell
in
the
quiet
night
there
was
never
a
sound
to
ken
but
all
of
the
woods
to
the
right
and
the
left
lay
filled
with
the
painted
men
have
i
been
and
much
have
i
seen
both
as
a
man
and
boy
but
never
have
i
set
forth
a
foot
on
so
perilous
an
it
fell
in
the
dusk
of
the
night
when
unco
things
betide
that
he
was
aware
of
a
drew
near
to
the
waterside
he
was
aware
of
his
coming
down
in
the
gloaming
alone
and
he
looked
in
the
face
of
the
man
and
lo
the
face
was
his
own
is
my
weird
he
said
now
i
ken
the
worst
for
many
shall
fall
the
morn
but
i
shall
fall
with
the
first
o
you
of
the
outland
tongue
you
of
the
painted
face
this
is
the
place
of
my
death
can
you
tell
me
the
name
of
the
place
the
frenchmen
have
been
here
they
have
called
it
but
that
is
a
name
for
priests
and
not
for
you
and
me
it
went
by
another
word
quoth
he
of
the
shaven
head
was
called
ticonderoga
in
the
days
of
the
great
and
it
fell
on
the
morning
in
the
fiercest
of
the
fight
that
the
cameron
bit
the
dust
as
he
foretold
at
night
and
far
from
the
hills
of
heather
far
from
the
isles
of
the
sea
he
sleeps
in
the
place
of
the
name
as
it
was
doomed
to
be
notes
to
ticonderoga
first
heard
this
legend
of
my
own
country
from
that
friend
of

of

alfred
nutt
in
roaring
central
stream
and
since
the
ballad
first
saw
the
light
of
day
in
nutt
and
lord
archibald
campbell
have
been
in
public
controversy
on
the
facts
two
clans
the
camerons
and
the
campbells
lay
claim
to
this
bracing
story
and
they
do
well
the
man
who
preferred
his
plighted
troth
to
the
commands
and
menaces
of
the
dead
is
an
ancestor
worth
disputing
but
the
campbells
must
rest
content
they
have
the
broad
lands
and
the
broad
page
of
history
this
appanage
must
be
denied
them
for
between
the
name
of
and
that
of
the
muse

never
hesitate

and

or
it
scarce
appears
how
our
friend
could
have
got
to
china
heather
ale
a
galloway
legend
heather
ale
from
the
bonny
bells
of
heather
they
brewed
a
drink
was
sweeter
far
than
honey
was
stronger
far
than
wine
they
brewed
it
and
they
drank
it
and
lay
in
a
blessed
swound
for
days
and
days
together
in
their
dwellings
underground
there
rose
a
king
in
scotland
a
fell
man
to
his
foes
he
smote
the
picts
in
battle
he
hunted
them
like
roes
over
miles
of
the
red
mountain
he
hunted
as
they
fled
and
strewed
the
dwarfish
bodies
of
the
dying
and
the
dead
summer
came
in
the
country
red
was
the
heather
bell
but
the
manner
of
the
brewing
was
none
alive
to
tell
in
graves
that
were
like
on
many
a
mountain
head
the
brewsters
of
the
heather
lay
numbered
with
the
dead
the
king
in
the
red
moorland
rode
on
a
day
and
the
bees
hummed
and
the
curlews
cried
beside
the
way
the
king
rode
and
was
angry
black
was
his
brow
and
pale
to
rule
in
a
land
of
heather
and
lack
the
heather
ale
it
fortuned
that
his
vassals
riding
free
on
the
heath
came
on
a
stone
that
was
fallen
and
vermin
hid
beneath
rudely
plucked
from
their
hiding
never
a
word
they
spoke
a
son
and
his
aged
last
of
the
dwarfish
folk
the
king
sat
high
on
his
charger
he
looked
on
the
little
men
and
the
dwarfish
and
swarthy
couple
looked
at
the
king
again
down
by
the
shore
he
had
them
and
there
on
the
giddy
will
give
you
life
ye
vermin
for
the
secret
of
the
there
stood
the
son
and
father
and
they
looked
high
and
low
the
heather
was
red
around
them
the
sea
rumbled
below
and
up
and
spoke
the
father
shrill
was
his
voice
to
hear
have
a
word
in
private
a
word
for
the
royal
ear
is
dear
to
the
aged
and
honour
a
little
thing
i
would
gladly
sell
the
secret
quoth
the
pict
to
the
king
his
voice
was
small
as
a
and
shrill
and
wonderful
clear
would
gladly
sell
my
secret
only
my
son
i
fear
life
is
a
little
matter
and
death
is
nought
to
the
young
and
i
dare
not
sell
my
honour
under
the
eye
of
my
son
take
o
king
and
bind
him
and
cast
him
far
in
the
deep
and
i
will
tell
the
secret
that
i
have
sworn
to
they
took
the
son
and
bound
him
neck
and
heels
in
a
thong
and
a
lad
took
him
and
swung
him
and
flung
him
far
and
strong
and
the
sea
swallowed
his
body
like
that
of
a
child
of
ten
and
there
on
the
cliff
stood
the
father
last
of
the
dwarfish
men
was
the
word
i
told
you
only
my
son

feared
for

doubt
the
sapling
courage
that
goes
without
the
beard
but
now
in
vain
is
the
torture
fire
shall
never
avail
here
dies
in
my
bosom
the
secret
of
heather
note
to
heather
ale
among
the
curiosities
of
human
nature
this
legend
claims
a
high
place
it
is
needless
to
remind
the
reader
that
the
picts
were
never
exterminated
and
form
to
this
day
a
large
proportion
of
the
folk
of
scotland
occupying
the
eastern
and
the
central
parts
from
the
firth
of
forth
or
perhaps
the
lammermoors
upon
the
south
to
the
ord
of
caithness
on
the
north
that
the
blundering
guess
of
a
dull
chronicler
should
have
inspired
men
with
imaginary
loathing
for
their
own
ancestors
is
already
strange
that
it
should
have
begotten
this
wild
legend
seems
incredible
is
it
possible
the
error
was
merely
nominal
that
what
he
told
and
what
the
people
proved
themselves
so
ready
to
receive
about
the
picts
was
true
or
partly
true
of
some
anterior
and
perhaps
lappish
savages
small
of
stature
black
of
hue
dwelling
also
the
distillers
of
some
forgotten
spirit
see
of
the
west
christmas
at
sea
christmas
at
sea
the
sheets
were
frozen
hard
and
they
cut
the
naked
hand
the
decks
were
like
a
slide
where
a
seaman
scarce
could
stand
the
wind
was
a
blowing
squally
off
the
sea
and
cliffs
and
spouting
breakers
were
the
only
things
they
heard
the
surf
before
the
break
of
day
but
only
with
the
peep
of
light
we
saw
how
ill
we
lay
we
tumbled
every
hand
on
deck
instanter
with
a
shout
and
we
gave
her
the
and
stood
by
to
go
about
all
day
we
tacked
and
tacked
between
the
south
head
and
the
north
all
day
we
hauled
the
frozen
sheets
and
got
no
further
forth
all
day
as
cold
as
charity
in
bitter
pain
and
dread
for
very
life
and
nature
we
tacked
from
head
to
head
we
gave
the
south
a
wider
berth
for
there
the
roared
but
every
tack
we
made
we
brought
the
north
head
close
aboard
we
saw
the
cliffs
and
houses
and
the
breakers
running
high
and
the
coastguard
in
his
garden
with
his
glass
against
his
eye
the
frost
was
on
the
village
roofs
as
white
as
ocean
foam
the
good
red
fires
were
burning
bright
in
every
home
the
windows
sparkled
clear
and
the
chimneys
volleyed
out
and
i
vow
we
sniffed
the
victuals
as
the
vessel
went
about
the
bells
upon
the
church
were
rung
with
a
mighty
jovial
cheer
for
just
that
i
should
tell
you
how
of
all
days
in
the
year
this
day
of
our
adversity
was
blessèd
christmas
morn
and
the
house
above
the
was
the
house
where
i
was
born
o
well
i
saw
the
pleasant
room
the
pleasant
faces
there
my
silver
spectacles
my
silver
hair
and
well
i
saw
the
firelight
like
a
flight
of
homely
elves
go
dancing
round
the
that
stand
upon
the
shelves
and
well
i
knew
the
talk
they
had
the
talk
that
was
of
me
of
the
shadow
on
the
household
and
the
son
that
went
to
sea
and
o
the
wicked
fool
i
seemed
in
every
kind
of
way
to
be
here
and
hauling
frozen
ropes
on
blessèd
christmas
day
they
lit
the
high
and
the
dark
began
to
fall
hands
to
loose
topgallant
sails
i
heard
the
captain
call
the
lord
never
stand
it
our
first
mate
jackson
the
one
way
or
the
other
jackson
he
replied
she
staggered
to
her
bearings
but
the
sails
were
new
and
good
and
the
ship
smelt
up
to
windward
just
as
though
she
understood
as
the
day
was
ending
in
the
entry
of
the
night
we
cleared
the
weary
headland
and
passed
below
the
light
and
they
heaved
a
mighty
breath
every
soul
on
board
but
me
as
they
saw
her
nose
again
pointing
handsome
out
to
sea
but
all
that
i
could
think
of
in
the
darkness
and
the
cold
was
just
that
i
was
leaving
home
and
my
folks
were
growing
old
the
end
