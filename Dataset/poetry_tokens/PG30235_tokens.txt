for

to
teachers
and
students
there
is
but
one
study
more
interesting
than
the
history
of
literature
and
that
is
the
study
of
literature
itself
that
the
former
should
often
be
mistaken
for
the
latter
is
scarcely
to
be
wondered
at
when
we
consider
the
intimate
and
almost
indivisible
relationship
existing
between
them
yet
in
truth
they
are
as
capable
of
separate
consideration
as
are
music
and
the
history
of
music
sidenote
poetry
sidenote
the
transition
period
any
careful
investigation
of
the
history
of
english
poetry
would
naturally
begin
at
a
point
of
time
some
six
or
seven
hundred
years
earlier
than
that
of
chaucer
from
such
investigation
we
should
learn
that
even
as
early
as
the
ninth
century
perhaps
indeed
the
eighth
there
were
in
england
some
composers
of
verse
in
the
tongue
that
the
songs
of
these
poets
were
chiefly
of
religion
or
of
war
and
that
being
written
in
a
language
very
different
from
our
modern
english
they
can
scarcely
be
considered
as
belonging
properly
to
our
literature
that
among
them
however
is
a
noble
poem
beowulf
the
oldest
epic
of
any
modern
people
which
was
probably
sung
or
recited
by
pagan
minstrels
long
before
it
was
written
down
in
permanent
form
that
after
the
conquest
of
england
by
the
normans
the
early
language
of
the
english
people
underwent
a
long
and
tedious
process
of
transition
a
blending
in
a
certain
sense
with
the
latinized
and
more
polished
tongue
of
their
conquerors
and
that
the
result
was
the
language
which
we
now
call
english
and
are
proud
to
claim
as
our
own
that
it
was
about
three
hundred
years
after
the
norman
conquest
namely
in
that
this
new
tongue
was
officially
recognized
and
authorized
to
be
used
in
the
courts
at
law
throughout
the
land
and
that
about
the
same
time
geoffrey
chaucer
composed
and
wrote
his
first
poems
we
should
learn
moreover
that
during
the
transition
period
mentioned
above
there
were
many
attempts
at
writing
poetry
resulting
in
the
production
of
tedious
metrical
romances
chiefly
translated
from
the
french
and
interminable
rhyming
chronicles
pleasing
of
course
to
the
people
of
that
time
but
wholly
devoid
of
poetic
excellence
and
unspeakably
dull
to
modern
readers
that
these
poems
so
called
were
little
better
than
rhymed
doggerels
written
in
couplets
of
lines
and
having
for
their
subjects
the
miraculous
deeds
of
saints
and
heroes
and
the
occurrence
of
supernatural
or
impossible
phenomena
that
the
composers
of
these
metrical
romances
and
chronicles
although
giving
free
rein
to
the
imagination
were
utterly
destitute
of
poetic
fancy
and
hence
produced
no
true
poetry
that
nevertheless
some
writer
was
now
and
then
inspired
by
a
flash
of
real
poetic
fire
producing
a
few
lines
of
remarkable
freshness
and
beauty
little
lyrics
shining
forth
like
gems
in
the
great
mass
of
verbiage
and
rubbish
and
foretelling
the
glorious
possibilities
which
were
to
be
realized
in
the
future
sidenote
piers
ploughman
continuing
this
most
interesting
study
we
should
learn
that
just
at
the
time
that
chaucer
was
beginning
the
composition
of
his
immortal
works
there
appeared
an
allegorical
poem
of
considerable
length
so
earnest
in
tone
so
richly
imaginative
so
full
of
picturesque
descriptions
that
it
seemed
rather
a
fulfilment
than
a
prophecy
that
this
poem
called
the
vision
of
william
concerning
piers
ploughman
and
written
by
an
obscure
monk
whose
name
was
probably
william
langland
was
the
greatest
poem
and
the
most
popular
that
had
ever
been
written
in
england
and
yet
that
it
failed
in
many
ways
of
being
true
english
poetry
its
metre
was
irregular
and
its
rhythm
was
imperfect
its
verses
instead
of
rhyming
were
constructed
in
accordance
with
certain
rules
of
alliteration
its
subjects
while
interesting
no
doubt
to
those
for
whom
it
was
written
were
not
such
as
bring
into
play
the
highest
powers
of
the
imagination
or
incite
the
poetic
fancy
to
its
noblest
flights
then
we
should
learn
that
while
the
ink
from
good
langland
pen
was
yet
scarcely
dry
after
his
third
revision
of
piers
ploughman
geoffrey
chaucer
came
forward
with
his
sweet
imaginings
bodied
in
immortal
verse
his
tuneful
numbers
his
well
of
english
undefiled
and
english
poetry
which
now
for
more
than
five
centuries
has
been
the
chief
glory
of
our
literature
had
its
true
beginning
sidenote
three
schools
of
poetry
pursuing
the
study
on
lines
which
would
now
be
more
distinctly
marked
we
should
observe
that
chaucer
best
poetry
as
well
as
that
of
the
poets
who
followed
him
in
the
fifteenth
and
sixteenth
centuries
was
distinguished
by
its
truthfulness
to
nature
by
its
expression
in
hearty
and
harmonious
words
of
the
finer
emotions
of
the
soul
and
by
the
freedom
and
elasticity
of
its
versification
we
should
learn
that
in
the
seventeenth
century
this
style
of
poetry
sometimes
called
the
romantic
was
succeeded
by
another
and
very
different
fashion
in
poetic
composition
introduced
into
england
in
imitation
of
continental
and
classical
models
that
this
new
style
of
versification
ignoring
nature
and
making
everything
subservient
to
art
was
purely
artificial
characterized
by
an
oratorical
pomp
a
classical
correctness
a
theatrical
dressing
abundance
of
moralizing
and
that
with
waller
for
its
sponsor
and
dryden
and
pope
for
its
high
priests
it
remained
for
a
century
and
a
half
the
favorite
of
the
literary
world
the
model
of
poetic
diction
the
standard
of
poetic
taste
we
should
learn
that
towards
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
certain
writers
began
to
perceive
that
although
attention
to
artistic
rules
in
composition
may
be
necessary
to
the
best
poetry
yet
natural
feeling
a
cultivated
imagination
and
a
fancy
unrestrained
by
merely
arbitrary
limitations
are
even
more
indispensable
that
these
writers
rebelling
against
the
established
order
of
things
taught
that
there
are
elements
of
true
poetry
in
the
popular
ballads
of
earlier
times
that
even
the
wearisome
metrical
romances
of
the
middle
ages
are
rich
in
suggestiveness
and
in
materials
for
a
nobler
poetry
and
that
instead
of
going
to
the
classics
and
to
society
for
subjects
and
models
the
poet
may
find
them
in
nature
in
the
life
which
is
about
him
and
in
a
thousand
sources
never
before
suspected
finally
we
should
learn
that
at
the
very
time
when
great
revolutions
in
politics
and
philosophy
were
being
inaugurated
a
new
spirit
thus
began
to
manifest
itself
in
our
literature
a
spirit
of
revolt
against
artificial
restrictions
and
traditional
methods
which
produced
a
glorious
revival
in
english
poetic
composition
and
ushered
in
a
third
great
school
of
poetry
distinguished
for
its
breadth
and
freedom
as
that
which
it
superseded
had
been
known
for
its
elegance
and
precision
sidenote
the
history
of
english
poetry
a
study
of
the
development
of
english
poetry
such
as
we
have
outlined
above
would
involve
a
knowledge
of
the
history
of
the
english
people
and
of
the
various
circumstances
and
events
which
from
time
to
time
influenced
our
language
and
literature
it
would
also
embrace
many
other
topics
biographical
philological
rhetorical
and
speculative
which
have
only
a
secondary
relationship
to
the
central
idea
of
poetry
in
fact
it
would
be
a
study
not
of
poetry
but
about
poetry
of
the
circumstances
which
suggested
it
of
the
men
who
produced
it
and
of
the
origin
of
the
and
methods
of
versification
which
distinguish
it
such
a
study
altogether
interesting
and
eminently
profitable
though
it
be
should
not
be
undertaken
by
any
student
until
he
has
acquired
an
extensive
personal
acquaintance
with
poetry
itself
we
may
enjoy
the
beautiful
creations
of
tennyson
of
shelley
of
burns
even
of
chaucer
without
knowing
one
word
of
the
history
of
poetry
without
so
much
as
knowing
the
names
of
the
writers
or
the
circumstances
under
which
they
wrote
but
on
the
other
hand
to
him
who
knows
nothing
of
the
masterpieces
of
our
literature
save
at
second
hand
the
history
of
english
letters
must
of
necessity
be
dull
uninteresting
and
often
unintelligible
while
to
him
who
has
prepared
himself
for
its
study
by
fitting
himself
for
an
appreciation
of
these
noble
creations
and
becoming
thoroughly
imbued
with
their
spirit
what
a
field
of
delightful
study
does
it
offer
sidenote
object
of
this
book
sidenote
methods
of
study
the
object
of
the
present
compilation
is
to
aid
in
this
preparatory
work
that
is
to
offer
a
plan
for
promoting
the
study
of
poetry
before
the
broader
but
less
important
study
about
poetry
is
undertaken
to
this
end
we
present
for
the
student
consideration
a
few
representative
poems
written
at
different
times
and
by
men
of
widely
different
tastes
and
talents
during
the
six
centuries
which
may
be
said
to
have
elapsed
since
the
formation
of
the
modern
english
tongue
our
chief
aim
is
to
lead
to
such
a
study
of
these
selections
as
shall
help
the
reader
to
perceive
and
appreciate
their
true
poetic
qualities
and
enter
into
full
sympathy
with
the
thoughts
and
feelings
which
their
writers
intended
to
express
the
first
object
to
be
sought
in
the
study
of
these
poems
is
the
perception
of
those
characteristic
excellences
which
have
made
them
universally
admired
and
placed
them
among
the
classics
of
our
language
to
accomplish
this
object
rationally
and
successfully
it
is
best
to
begin
with
those
productions
which
are
nearest
to
us
in
point
of
time
and
which
are
more
in
harmony
with
our
own
thoughts
and
therefore
easiest
to
understand
and
enjoy
an
attempt
to
pursue
these
studies
in
chronological
order
beginning
with
the
works
of
chaucer
and
the
older
poets
would
oblige
the
student
to
encounter
at
the
outset
so
many
purely
mechanical
difficulties
that
he
would
fail
to
discern
the
spiritual
qualities
of
truth
beauty
and
goodness
which
are
the
very
essence
of
all
genuine
poetry
he
would
very
naturally
acquire
a
distaste
for
poetry
long
before
he
was
able
to
understand
it
and
while
he
might
attain
to
some
considerable
knowledge
of
the
history
of
poetical
literature
that
literature
itself
would
remain
to
him
practically
a
sealed
book
hence
in
the
study
of
this
subject
as
in
that
of
other
branches
the
true
method
is
to
present
first
that
which
is
the
least
difficult
to
proceed
from
the
known
to
the
unknown
to
begin
with
that
which
is
near
at
hand
and
from
it
to
proceed
to
the
consideration
of
things
more
remote
not
only
are
the
most
of
poems
easily
understood
but
their
beauty
is
readily
apparent
even
to
the
most
superficial
readers
by
the
time
we
have
read
and
extracted
all
the
sweets
from
three
or
four
of
these
we
shall
be
prepared
to
go
a
step
farther
and
undertake
the
study
of
wordsworth
immortal
productions
productions
but
little
more
difficult
and
but
little
less
poetic
thus
step
by
step
we
may
review
the
six
centuries
of
english
poetry
which
lie
behind
and
when
at
last
we
reach
the
time
of
chaucer
we
shall
be
able
to
take
hold
of
his
works
with
understanding
and
with
the
zest
which
is
begotten
of
true
sympathy
and
appreciation
after
the
book
has
been
thus
completed
it
may
be
well
to
run
through
it
again
reversing
the
order
of
the
lessons
and
this
time
considering
the
subjects
in
strict
chronological
order
our
first
study
of
the
book
will
have
introduced
us
to
english
poetry
our
second
study
of
it
will
have
given
us
some
insight
into
the
history
of
its
development
it
is
well
to
remember
while
pursuing
this
course
that
a
taste
for
poetry
is
not
acquired
or
fostered
by
an
analysis
of
grammatical
forms
or
by
any
study
of
words
merely
as
such
to
analyze
a
puzzling
sentence
or
to
trace
the
derivation
of
an
interesting
word
to
its
roots
sometimes
helps
one
to
understand
a
difficult
expression
or
to
perceive
in
it
a
meaning
hitherto
unsuspected
but
to
make
the
study
of
any
selection
consist
largely
of
exercises
of
this
kind
is
to
substitute
grammar
or
philology
for
literature
so
also
should
it
be
borne
in
mind
that
while
it
is
often
interesting
and
sometimes
necessary
to
become
acquainted
with
certain
details
relative
to
the
life
of
an
author
the
date
of
his
birth
the
character
of
his
education
the
influences
which
shaped
his
life
and
his
work
yet
such
knowledge
belongs
to
biography
and
is
in
no
sense
literature
the
study
of
authors
should
never
be
substituted
for
the
study
of
their
works
and
is
usually
profitable
only
so
far
as
it
helps
the
student
to
understand
the
peculiarities
which
distinguish
those
works
and
which
are
the
result
of
certain
personal
characteristics
and
yet
it
is
no
uncommon
thing
to
find
students
acquainted
with
the
minutest
particulars
in
the
lives
of
the
great
writers
while
of
the
masterpieces
of
thought
and
expression
which
are
the
glory
of
our
literature
they
betray
a
deplorable
ignorance
nor
is
this
the
case
with
pupils
at
school
alone
for
once
that
we
take
down
a
milton
and
read
a
book
of
that
as
wordsworth
says
sound
is
like
the
sea
we
take
up
fifty
times
a
magazine
with
something
about
milton
or
about
milton
grandmother
or
a
book
stuffed
with
curious
facts
about
the
houses
in
which
he
lived
and
the
juvenile
ailments
of
his
first
wife
sidenote
practical
suggestions
in
the
study
of
the
selections
contained
in
this
volume
the
following
method
is
recommended
the
piece
should
be
thoroughly
committed
to
memory
it
should
be
recited
or
read
by
each
member
of
the
class
in
such
manner
as
to
bring
out
if
possible
his
understanding
of
the
meaning
of
every
passage
study
the
poem
as
a
whole
and
let
each
pupil
point
out
the
beauties
of
thought
or
expression
which
distinguish
it
as
a
poetical
composition
now
study
each
stanza
or
each
independent
thought
in
its
order
and
endeavor
to
understand
each
word
or
expression
just
as
the
poet
intended
that
it
should
be
understood
the
notes
appended
to
most
of
the
selections
are
intended
rather
to
suggest
the
line
of
study
in
this
regard
than
to
serve
as
exhaustive
aids
the
pupil
should
so
far
as
possible
investigate
for
himself
and
make
his
own
discoveries
questions
concerning
the
derivation
of
words
and
the
syntax
of
sentences
are
to
be
discussed
only
so
far
as
they
will
aid
in
the
understanding
of
some
passage
or
of
the
piece
as
a
whole
learn
some
of
the
most
important
facts
connected
with
the
life
what
were
the
conditions
under
which
he
wrote
this
piece
what
was
the
character
of
his
education
and
of
the
other
influences
which
shaped
his
life
and

six
centuries
of
english
poetry
the
nineteenth
century
appeared
the
english
romantic
school
a
sect
of
in
poetry
who
spoke
out
aloud
kept
themselves
close
together
and
repelled
settled
minds
by
the
audacity
and
novelty
of
their
theories
they
had
violently
broken
with
tradition
and
leaped
over
all
classical
culture
to
take
their
models
from
the
renaissance
and
the
they
sought
in
the
old
national
ballads
and
ancient
poetry
of
foreign
lands
the
fresh
and
primitive
accent
which
had
been
wanting
in
classical
literature
and
whose
presence
seemed
to
them
to
be
a
sign
of
truth
and
beauty
they
proposed
to
adapt
to
poetry
the
ordinary
language
of
conversation
such
as
is
spoken
in
the
middle
and
lower
classes
and
to
replace
studied
phrases
and
a
lofty
vocabulary
by
natural
tones
and
plebeian
words
in
place
of
the
classic
mould
they
tried
stanzas
sonnets
ballads
blank
verse
with
the
roughness
and
subdivisions
of
the
primitive
some
had
culled
gigantic
legends
piled
up
dreams
ransacked
the
east
greece
arabia
the
middle
ages
and
overloaded
the
human
imagination
with
hues
and
fancies
from
every
clime
others
had
buried
themselves
in
metaphysics
and
moral
philosophy
had
mused
indefatigably
on
the
condition
of
man
and
spent
their
lives
on
the
sublime
and
the
monotonous
others
making
a
medley
of
crime
and
heroism
had
conducted
through
darkness
and
flashes
of
lightning
a
train
of
contorted
and
terrible
figures
desperate
with
remorse
relieved
by
their
grandeur
men
wanted
to
rest
after
so
many
efforts
and
so
much
success
on
the
going
out
of
the
imaginative
sentimental
and
satanic
school
tennyson
appeared
exquisite
all
the
forms
and

which

pleased

cheerly

down

the

weary
piling

the
fairy
lady

there
she
weaves
by
night

a
magic
web
with
colors
gay
she
has
heard
a
whisper

a
curse
is
on
her
if
she
stay
to
look
down

camelot

knows
not
what
the

may
be

so
she
weaveth
steadily
and
little

hath

of

and
moving
through
a
mirror
clear
that
hangs
before
her
all
the

of

appear
there
she
sees

down

the
whirls

there

and
the

cloaks

come
riding
two
and
two
she
hath
no
loyal
knight
and
true
the
lady
of
shalott
but
in
her
web
she
still
delights
to
weave
the
mirrored
magic
sights
for
often
through
the
silent
nights
a
funeral
with
plumes
and
lights
and
music
went

overhead

a
from
her
he
rode
between
the
the
sun
came
dazzling
through
the
leaves
and
flamed
upon
the
brazen
greaves
of
bold
sir
lancelot
a
knight
forever
kneeled
to
a
lady
in
his
shield
that
sparkled
on
the
yellow
field
beside
remote
shalott
the
gemmy
bridle
glittered
free
like
to
some
branch
of
stars
we
see
hung
in
the
golden
galaxy
the
rang
merrily
as
he
rode
down
to
camelot
and
from
his
blazoned
baldric
slung
a
mighty
silver
bugle
hung
and
as
he
rode
his
armor
rung
beside
remote
shalott
all
in
the
blue
unclouded
weather
shone
the
the
helmet
and
the
burned
like
one
burning
flame
together
as
he
rode
down
to
camelot
as
often
through
the
purple
night
below
the
starry
clusters
bright
some
bearded
meteor
trailing
light
moves
over
still
shalott
his
broad
clear
brow
in
sunlight
glowed
on
burnished
hooves
his
trode
from
underneath
his
helmet
flowed
his
curls
as
on
he
rode

he
rode
down

the
bank

from
the
river

flashed
into

crystal
mirror

sir
lancelot
she
left

she
left

loom
she
made
three
paces
through
the
room
she
saw
the
bloom
she
saw
the
helmet
and
the
plume
she
looked
down
to
camelot
out
flew
the
web
and
floated
wide
the
mirror
cracked
from

to

come
upon

cried
the
lady
of
shalott
part
iv
in
the
stormy
straining
the
pale
yellow
woods
were
waning
the
broad
stream
in
his
banks
complaining
heavily
the
low
sky
raining
over
towered
camelot
down
she
came
and
found
a
boat
beneath
a
willow
left
afloat
and
round
about
the
prow
she
wrote
lady
of
and
down
the
river
dim
expanse
like
some
bold
seër
in
a
trance
seeing
all
his
own
mischance
with
a
glassy
countenance
did
she
look
to
camelot
and
at
the
closing
of
the
day
she
loosed
the
chain
and
down
she
lay
the
broad
stream
bore
her
far
away
the
lady
of
shalott
lying
robed
in
snowy
white
that
loosely
flew
to
left
and
right
the
leaves
upon
her
falling
light
through
the
noises
of
the
night
she
floated
down
to
camelot
and
as
the
wound
along
the
willowy
hills
and
fields
among
they
heard
her
singing
her
last
song
the
lady
of
shalott
heard
a
carol
mournful
holy
chanted
loudly
chanted
lowly
till
her
blood
was
frozen
slowly
and
her
eyes
were
darkened
wholly
turned
to
towered
camelot
for
ere
she
reached
upon
the
tide
the
first
house
by
the
singing
in
her
song
she
died
the
lady
of
shalott
under
tower
and
balcony
by
and
gallery
a
gleaming
shape
she
floated
by
a
corse
between
the
houses
high
silent
into
camelot
out
upon
the
wharfs
they
came
knight
and
burgher
lord
and
dame
and
round
the
prow
they
read
her
name
lady
of
who
is
this
and
what
is
here
and
in
the
lighted
palace
near
died
the
sound
of
royal
cheer
and
they
crossed
themselves
for
fear
all
the
knights
at
camelot
but
lancelot
mused
a
little
space
he
said
she
has
a
lovely
face
god
in
his
mercy
lend
her
grace
the
lady
of
shalott
notes
this
poem
was
written
in
considered
as
a
picture
or
as
a
series
of
pictures
its
beauty
is
unsurpassed
the
story
which
is
here
so
briefly
told
is
founded
upon
a
touching
legend
connected
with
the
romance
of
king
arthur
and
his
knights
of
the
round
table
tennyson
afterwards
in
expanded
it
into
the
called
elaine
wherein
he
followed
more
closely
the
original
narrative
as
related
by
sir
thomas
malory
sir
lancelot
was
the
strongest
and
bravest
of
the
knights
of
the
round
table
and
for
him
elaine
the
fair
maid
of
astolat
conceived
a
hopeless
passion
her
love
was
platonic
and
pure
as
that
of
a
child
but
it
was
masterful
in
its
strength
having
learned
that
lancelot
was
pledged
to
celibacy
she
pined
away
and
died
but
before
her
death
she
called
her
brother
and
having
dictated
a
letter
which
he
was
to
write
she
spake
thus
my
body
is
whole
let
this
letter
be
put
into
my
right
hand
and
my
hand
bound
fast
with
the
letter
until
i
be
cold
and
let
me
be
put
in
a
fair
bed
with
all
my
richest
clothes
that
i
have
about
me
and
so
let
my
bed
and
all
my
rich
clothes
be
laid
with
me
in
a
chariot
to
the
next
place
whereas
the
thames
is
and
there
let
me
be
put
in
a
barge
and
but
one
man
with
me
such
as
ye
trust
to
steer
me
thither
and
that
my
barge
be
covered
with
black
samite
over
and
so
when
she
was
dead
the
corpse
and
the
bed
and
all
was
led
the
next
way
unto
the
thames
and
there
all
were
put
in
a
barge
on
the
thames
and
so
the
man
steered
the
barge
to
westminster
and
there
he
rowed
a
great
while
to
and
fro
or
any
man
espied
a
at
length
the
king
and
his
knights
coming
down
to
the
waterside
and
seeing
the
boat
and
the
lily
maid
of
astolat
they
uplifted
the
hapless
body
of
elaine
and
bore
it
to
the
hall
but
arthur
spied
the
letter
in
her
hand
stoopt
took
brake
seal
and
read
it
this
was
all
noble
lord
sir
lancelot
of
the
lake
i
sometime
called
the
maid
of
astolat
come
for
you
left
me
taking
no
farewell
hither
to
take
my
last
farewell
of
you
i
loved
you
and
my
love
had
no
return
and
therefore
my
true
love
has
been
my
pray
for
my
soul
and
yield
me
burial
pray
for
my
soul
thou
too
sir
lancelot
as
thou
art
a
knight
peerless
a
and
so
the
maid
was
buried
not
as
one
unknown
nor
meanly
but
with
gorgeous
obsequies
and
mass
and
rolling
music
like
a
queen
and
the
story
of
her
dolorous
voyage
was
blazoned
on
her
tomb
in
letters
gold
and
azure
an
open
tract
of
hilly
country
where
but
few
trees
are
left
this
word
is
more
frequently
used
however
to
designate
a
forest
or
thick
wood
it
is
supposed
that
this
camelot
was
winchester
it
was
the
seat
of
king
arthur
court
and
visitors
are
still
shown
the
remains
of
what
appear
to
have
been
certain
kinds
of
intrenchments
which
the
inhabitants
call
king
arthur
palace
sir
thomas
malory
says
sir
ballin
sword
was
put
into
marble
stone
standing
it
upright
as
a
great
millstone
and
it
swam
down
the
stream
to
the
city
of
camelot
that
is
in
english
wincheste
there
was
another
camelot
also
king
capital
on
the
river
camel
in
cornwall
to
which
shakespeare
makes
reference
in
ii
ii
tennyson
in
gareth
and
lynette
describes
the
appearance
of
the
city
when
approached
in
the
early
morning
far
off
they
saw
the
morn
rolling
her
smoke
about
the
royal
mount
that
rose
between
the
forest
and
the
field
at
times
the
summit
of
the
high
city
flash
at
times
the
spires
and
turrets
down
prick
thro
the
mist
at
times
the
great
gate
shone
only
that
open
on
the
field
below
anon
the
whole
fair
city
had
disappear
produce
a
ruffled
surface
a
very
rare
use
of
this
word
the
river
referred
to
is
probably
the
thames
lat
to
draw
dutch
to
tow
what
picture
is

this

a
part
of
an
idyl
of
the

title
published
in

introduces
it
in
the
following
manner
here
by
this
brook
we
parted
i
to
the
east
and
he
to
italy
too
late
too
late
yet
the
brook
he
loved
seems
as
i
to
it
prattling
the
primrose

of
the

in
reading
this

observe
how
strikingly
the
sound
is
made
to
correspond
to
the
sense
a
wild
resembling
the

us
shoreward
soon
in
the
afternoon
they
came
unto
a
land
in
which
it
seemed
always
afternoon
all
round
the
coast
the
languid
air
did
swoon
breathing
like
one
that
hath
a
weary
dream
above
the
valley
stood
the
moon
and
like
a
downward
smoke
the
slender
stream
along
the
cliff
to
fall
and
pause
and
fall
did
seem
a
land
of
streams
some
like
a
downward
smoke
veils
of
thinnest
lawn
did
go
and
some
through
wavering
lights
and
shadows
broke
rolling
a
slumbrous
sheet
of
foam
below
they
saw
the
gleaming
river
seaward
flow
from
the
inner
land
far
off
three
three
silent
pinnacles
of
aged
snow
stood
and
dewed
with
showery
drops
the
shadowy
pine
above
the
woven
copse
the
charmed
sunset
lingered
low
adown
in
the
red
west
through
mountain
clefts
the
dale
was
seen
far
inland
and
the
yellow
down
bordered
with
palm
and
many
a
winding
vale
and
meadow
set
with
slender
galingale
a
land
where
all
things
always
seemed
the
same
and
round
about
the
keel
with
faces
pale
dark
faces
pale
against
that
rosy
flame
the
melancholy
came
branches
they
bore
of
that
enchanted
stem
laden
with
flower
and
fruit
whereof
they
gave
to
each
but
whoso
did
receive
of
them
and
taste
to
him
the
gushing
of
the
wave
far
far
away
did
seem
to
mourn
and
rave
on
alien
shores
and
if
his
fellow
spake
his
voice
was
thin
as
voices
from
the
grave
and
he
seemed
yet
all
awake
and
music
in
his
ears
his
beating
heart
did
make
they
sat
them
down
upon
the
yellow
sand
between
the
sun
and
moon
upon
the
shore
and
sweet
it
was
to
dream
of
of
child
and
wife
and
slave
but
evermore
most
weary
seemed
the
sea
weary
the
oar
weary
the
wandering
fields
of
barren
foam
then
some
one
said
we
will
return
no
more
and
all
at
once
they
sang
our
island
home
is
far
beyond
the
wave
we
will
no
longer
roam
choric
song
i
there
is
sweet
music
here
that
softer
falls
than
petals
from
blown
roses
on
the
grass
or
on
still
waters
between
walls
of
shadowy
granite
in
a
gleaming
pass
music
that
gentlier
on
the
spirit
lies
than
tired
eyelids
upon
tired
eyes
music
that
brings
sweet
sleep
down
from
the
blissful
skies
here
are
cool
mosses
deep
and
thro
the
moss
the
ivies
creep
and
in
the
stream
the
flowers
weep
and
from
the
craggy
ledge
the
poppy
hangs
in
sleep
ii
why
are
we
weighed
upon
with
heaviness
and
utterly
consumed
with
sharp
distress
while
all
things
else
have
rest
from
weariness
all
things
have
rest
why
should
we
toil
alone
we
only
toil
who
are
the
first
of
things
and
make
perpetual
moan
still
from
one
sorrow
to
another
thrown
nor
ever
fold
our
wings
and
cease
from
wanderings
nor
steep
our
brows
in
slumber
holy
balm
nor
hearken
what
the
inner
spirit
sings
there
is
no
joy
but
calm
why
should
we
only
toil
the
roof
and
crown
of
things
iii
lo
in
the
middle
of
the
wood
the
folded
leaf
is
woo
from
out
the
bud
with
winds
upon
the
branch
and
there
grows
green
and
broad
and
takes
no
care
at
noon
and
in
the
moon
nightly
and
turning
yellow
falls
and
floats
adown

us

his

find
a
music
centred
in
a
doleful
song
steaming
up
a
lamentation
and
an
ancient
tale
of
wrong
like
a
tale

on

we
set

on
the
land
of
the
who
eat
a
flowery
food
so
we
stepped
ashore
and
drew
water
and
straightway
my
company
took
their
meal
by
the
swift
ships
now
when
we
had
tasted
meat
and
drink
i
sent
forth
certain
of
my
company
to
go
and
make
search
of
what
manner
of
men
they
were
who
here
live
upon
the
earth
by
bread
and
i
chose
out
two
of

and
sent
a
third
with
them
as
herald

straightway
they
went

mixed
with

so
it
was

gave

whosoever
of
them
did
eat
the
fruit
of
the
lotus
had
no
more
wish
to
bring

nor
to
come
back
but
there
he
chose
to
abide
with
the
men
ever
feeding
on
the
lotus
and
forgetful
of
his
homeward
way
therefore
i
led
them
back
to
the
ships
weeping
and
sore
against
their
will
and
dragged
them
beneath
the
benches
and
bound
them
in
the
hollow
barques
but
i
commanded
the
rest
of
my
company
to
make
speed
and
go
on
board
the
swift
ships
lest
haply
any
should
eat
of

ix
in
this
poem
the
artistic
ideal
of
the
young
poet
it
was
written
in
found
its
most
finished
expression
and
its
culminating
point
here
he
seems
to
have
attained
a
consciousness
that
beyond
the
ideal
which
he
had
adopted
there
is
another
larger
grander
and
more
satisfying
nowhere
else
perhaps
in
the
range
of
poetry
is
the
trance
of
a
listless
life
so
harmoniously
married
to
appropriate
melodies
and
appropriate
accompaniments
british
biographical
note
alfred
tennyson
was
born
at
somersby
lincolnshire
england
in
his
early
education
was
received
at
home
from
his
father
who
was
rector
of
somersby
and
vicar
of
bennington
and
grimsby
he
was
afterwards
sent
to
trinity
college
cambridge
where
at
the
age
of
twenty
he
received
the
chancellor
medal
for
a
poem
in
blank
verse
entitled
timbuctoo
in
he
published
a
small
volume
of
poems
chiefly
lyrical
a
revised
edition
of
this
volume
published
in
contained
the
lady
of
shalott
the
and
others
of
his
short
poems
in
upon
the
death
of
wordsworth
he
was
appointed
in
the
same
year
he
was
married
to
emily
daughter
of
henry
sellwood
and
niece
of
sir
john
franklin
since
tennyson
has
resided
for
the
greater
part
of
the
time
at
farringford
freshwater
isle
of
wight
in
december
he
was
made
baron
tennyson
of
aldworth
and
freshwater
tennyson
says
hutton
was
an
artist
even
before
he
was
a
poet
in
other
words
the
eye
for
beauty
grace
and
harmony
of
effect
was
even
more
emphatically
one
of
his
original
gifts
than
the
voice
for
poetic
utterance
itself
this
probably
it
is
which
makes
his
very
earliest
pieces
appear
so
full
of
effort
and
sometimes
even
so
full
of
affectation
they
were
elaborate
attempts
to
embody
what
he
saw
before
the
natural
voice
of
the
poet
had
come
to
him
i
think
it
possible
to
trace
not
only
a
period
in
his
art
but
to
date
the
period
at
which
the
soul
was
into
his
poetry
and
the
brilliant
external
figures
became
the
of
germinating
poetic
thoughts
creating
their
own
music
curiously
enough
the
first
poem
where
there
is
any
trace
of
those
musings
of
the
round
table
to
which
he
has
directed
so
much
of
his
maturest
genius
is
also
a
confession
that
the
poet
was
sick
of
the
magic
mirror
of
fancy
and
its
and
was
turning
away
from
them
to
the
poetry
of
human
life
whenever
tennyson
pictorial
fancy
has
had
it
in
any
degree
in
its
power
to
run
away
with
the
guiding
and
controlling
mind
the
richness
and
the
workmanship
have
to
some
extent
overgrown
the
spiritual
principle
of
his
poems
it
is
obvious
for
instance
that
even
in
relation
to
natural
scenery
what
his
poetical
faculty
delights
in
most
are
rich
luxuriant
landscapes
in
which
either
nature
or
man
has
accumulated
a

ode
intimations
of

from
recollections
of
early
childhood
the
child
is
father
of
the
man
and
i
could
wish
my
days
to
be
bound
each
to
each
by
natural
piety
i
there
was
a
time
when
meadow
grove
and
stream
the
earth
and
every
common
sight
to
me
did
seem
apparelled
in
celestial
light
the
glory
and
the
freshness
of
a
dream
it
is
not
now
as
it
hath
been
of
yore
turn
i
may
by
night
or
day
the
things
which
i
have
seen
i
now
can
see
no
more
ii
the
rainbow
comes
and
goes
and
lovely
is
the
rose
the
moon
doth
with
delight
look
round
her
when
the
heavens
are
bare
waters
on
a
starry
night
are
beautiful
and
fair
the
sunshine
is
a
glorious
birth
but
yet
i
know
i
go
that
there
hath
passed
away
a
glory
from
the
earth
iii
now
while
the
birds
thus
sing
a
joyous
song
and
while
the
young
lambs
bound
as
to
the
tabor
sound
to
me
alone
there
came
a
thought
of
grief
a
timely
utterance
gave
that
thought
relief
and
i
again
am
strong
the
cataracts
blow
their
trumpets
from
the
steep
no
more
shall
grief
of
mine
the
season
wrong
i
hear
the
echoes
through
the
mountains
throng
the
winds
come
to
me
from
the
fields
of
sleep
and
all
the
earth
is
gay
land
and
sea
give
themselves
up
to
jollity
and
with
the
heart
of
may
doth
every
beast
keep
holiday

child
of
joy

round
me

me
hear
thy
shouts

its

your
bliss

sweet

the

culling
on

side

thousand

fresh
flowers

the
sun
shines
warm
and
the
babe
leaps
up

o

that
in

embers
is
something
that
doth
live
that
nature

remembers
what
was

fugitive

perpetual
benediction

raise
the
song

for
those
obstinate
questionings
of
sense
and
outward
things
fallings
from
us
vanishings
blank
misgivings
of
a
creature
moving
about
in
worlds
not
realized
high
instincts
before
which
our
mortal
nature
did
tremble
like
a
guilty
thing
surprised

for
those

those
shadowy
recollections

neither
listlessness

will
grieve
not

strength
in
what
remains
behind
in
the
primal
sympathy
which
having
been
must
ever
be
in
the
soothing
thoughts
that
spring
out
of
human
suffering

faith

looks

only
have
relinquished
one
delight
to
live
beneath
your
more
habitual
sway
i
love
the
brooks
which
down
their
channels
fret
even
more
than
when
i
tripped
lightly
as
they
the
innocent
brightness
of
a
day
is
lovely
yet
the
clouds
that
gather
round
the

take

sober
coloring

kept

notes
this
was
composed
says
wordsworth
during
my
residence
at
grasmere
two
years
at
least
passed
between
the
writing
of
the
first
four
stanzas
and
the
remaining
part
to
the
attentive
and
competent
reader
the
whole
sufficiently
explains
itself
but
there
may
be
no
harm
in
adverting
here
to
particular
feelings
or
experiences
of
my
own
mind
on
which
the
structure
of
the
poem
partly
rests
nothing
was
more
difficult
for
me
in
childhood
than
to
admit
the
notion
of
death
as
a
state
applicable
to
my
own
being
i
have
said
elsewhere
simple
child
that
lightly
draws
its
breath
and
feels
its
life
in
every
limb
what
should
it
know
of
death
a
but
it
was
not
so
much
from
the
source
of
animal
vivacity
that
difficulty
came
as
from
a
sense
of
the
indomitableness
of
the
spirit
within
me
i
used
to
brood
over
the
stories
of
enoch
and
elijah
and
almost
persuade
myself
that
whatever
might
become
of
others
i
should
be
translated
in
something
of
the
same
way
to
heaven
with
a
feeling
congenial
to
this
i
was
often
unable
to
think
of
external
things
as
having
external
existence
and
i
communed
with
all
that
i
saw
as
something
not
apart
from
but
inherent
in
my
own
immaterial
nature
many
times
while
going
to
school
have
i
grasped
at
a
wall
or
tree
to
recall
myself
from
this
abyss
of
idealism
to
reality
at
that
time
i
was
afraid
of
mere
processes
in
later
periods
of
life
i
have
deplored
as
we
have
all
reason
to
do
a
subjugation
of
an
opposite
character
and
have
rejoiced
over
the
remembrances
as
is
expressed
in
the
lines
etc
to
that
vividness
and
splendor
which
invests
objects
of
sight
in
childhood
every
one
i
believe
if
he
could
look
back
could
bear
testimony
and
i
need
not
dwell
upon
it
here
but
having
in
the
poem
regarded
it
as
a
presumptive
evidence
of
a
prior
state
of
existence
i
think
it
right
to
protest
against
a
conclusion
which
has
given
pain
to
some
good
and
pious
persons
that
i
meant
to
inculcate
such
a
belief
it
is
far
too
shadowy
a
notion
to
be
recommended
to
faith
as
more
than
an
element
in
our
instincts
of
immortality
but
let
us
bear
in
mind
that
though
the
idea
is
not
advanced
in
revelation
there
is
nothing
there
to
contradict
it
and
the
fall
of
man
presents
an
analogy
in
its
favor
accordingly
a
state
has
entered
into
the
popular
creeds
of
many
nations
and
among
all
persons
acquainted
with
classic
literature
is
known
as
an
ingredient
in
platonic
philosophy
archimedes
said
that
he
could
move
the
world
if
he
had
a
point
whereon
to
rest
his
machine
who
has
not
felt
the
same
aspirations
as
regards
the
world
of
his
mind
having
to
wield
some
of
its
elements
when
i
was
impelled
to
write
this
poem
on
the
of
the
soul
i
took
hold
of
the
notion
of
as
having
sufficient
foundation
in
humanity
for
authorizing
me
to
make
for
my
purpose
the
best
use
of
it
i
could
as
a
poet
lord
houghton
says
of
this
poem
if
i
am
asked
what
is
the
greatest
poem
in
the
english
language
i
never
for
a
moment
hesitate
to
say
wordsworth
on
the
intimations
of
immortality
principal
shairp
says
ode
on
immortality
marks
the
highest
limit
which
the
tide
of
poetic
inspiration
has
reached
in
england
within
this
century
or
indeed
since
the
days
of
milton
the
idea
of
the
of
the
soul
had
already
been
treated
by
henry
vaughan
in

infant
days
when
i
shined
in
my
before
i
understood
this
place
appointed
for
my
second
race
or
taught
my
soul
to
fancy
aught
but
a
white
celestial
thought
when
yet
i
had
not
walked
above
a
mile
or
two
from
my
first
love
and
looking
back
at
that
short
space
could
see
a
glimpse
of
his
bright
face
shelley
in
a
lament
hints
at

thought
o

o
life
o

last
steps
i
climb
trembling
at
that

stood

as
at

banquets
on
such
occasions
it
was
usual
for
the

to
give

to
his

festoons
of

were
also
sometimes
hung

we

than
see
that
wordsworth
intended
to
say
that
the
child
having
lately
come
from
a
perfect
existence
in
which
he
saw
truth
directly
and
was
at
home
with

retains
unknown

us
that
vision

because
he
does

the
best

since
he
sees
at
once
that
which
we
through
philosophy
are
endeavoring
to
reach
is
the
mighty
prophet
because
in
his
actions
and
speech
he
tells
unconsciously
the
truths
he
sees
but
the
sight
of
which
we
have
lost
is
more
closely
haunted
by

more
near
to

ah
why
in

do
we
revert
so
fondly
to
the
walks
of
childhood
but
that
there
the
soul
discerns
the
dear
memorial
footsteps
of
her
own
native
vigor
thence
can
hear
reverberations
and

choral
song
commingling

toward

stanza
of
we

said
to
have
been
written
by
coleridge
the
two
april
mornings
we
walked
along
while
bright
and
red
uprose
the
morning
sun
and
matthew
stopped
he
looked
and
said
will
of
god
be
done
a
village
schoolmaster
was
he
with
hair
of
glittering
gray
as
blithe
a
man
as
you
could
see
on
a
spring
holiday
and
on
that
morning
through
the
grass
and
by
the
steaming
rills
we
travelled
merrily
to
pass
a
day
among
the
hills
work
said
i
well
begun
then
from
thy
breast
what
thought
beneath
so
beautiful
a
sun
so
sad
a
sigh
has
brought
a
second
time
did
matthew
stop
and
fixing
still
his
eye
upon
the
eastern
to
me
he
made
reply
cloud
with
that
long
purple
cleft
brings
fresh
into
my
mind
a
day
like
this
which
i
have
left
full
thirty
years
behind
and
just
above
yon
slope
of
corn
such
colors
and
no
other
were
in
the
sky
that
april
morn
of
this
the
very
brother
with
rod
and
line
i
sued
the
sport
which
that
sweet
season
gave
and
to
the
come
stopped
short
beside
my
daughter
grave
nine
summers
had
she
scarcely
seen
the
pride
of
all
the
vale
and
then
she
sang
she
would
have
been
a
very
nightingale
six
feet
in
earth
my
emma
lay
and
yet
i
loved
her
more
for
so
it
seemed
than
till
that
day
i
had
loved
before
and
turning
from
her
grave
i
met
beside
the
churchyard
yew
a
blooming
girl
whose
hair
was
wet
with
points
of
morning
dew
a
basket
on
her
head
she
bare
her
brow
was
smooth
and
white
to
see
a
child
so
very
fair
it
was
a
pure
delight
no
fountain
from
its
rocky
cave
tripped
with
foot
so
free
she
seemed
as
happy
as
a
wave
that
dances
on
the
sea
there
came
from
me
a
sigh
of
pain
which
i
could
ill
confine
i
looked
at
her
and
looked
again
and
did
not
wish
her
mine
matthew
is
in
his
grave
yet
now
methinks
i
see
him
stand
as
at
that
moment
with
a
bough
of
wilding
in
his
hand
notes
this
poem
was
written
in
and
published
the
following
year
this
old
schoolmaster
is
described
elsewhere
by
wordsworth
as
being
made
up
of
several
both
of
his
class
and
men
of
other
occupations
a
twig
from
a
wild
apple
tree
ten
ruddy
wildings
in
the
wood
i
found
the
solitary
reaper
behold
her
single
in
the
field
yon
solitary
highland
lass
reaping
and
singing
by
herself
stop
here
or
gently
pass
alone
she
cuts
and
binds
the
grain
and
sings
a
melancholy
strain
o
listen
for
the
vale
profound
is
overflowing
with
the
sound
no
nightingale
did
ever
chaunt
more
welcome
notes
to
weary
bands
of
travellers
in
some
shady
haunt
among
arabian
sands
a
voice
so
thrilling
was
heard
in
from
a
breaking
the
silence
of
the
seas
among
the
farthest
hebrides
will
no
one
tell
me
what
she
sings
perhaps
the
plaintive
numbers
flow
for
old
unhappy
things
and
battles
long
ago
or
is
it
some
more
humble
lay
familiar
matter
of
some
natural
sorrow
loss
or
pain
that
has
been
or
may
be
again
the
theme
the
maiden
sang
as
if
her
song
could
have
no
ending
i
saw
her
singing
at
her
work
and
the
sickle
bending
i
listened
motionless
and
still
and
as
i
mounted
up
the
hill
the
music
in
my
heart
i
bore
long
after
it
was
heard
no

biographical
note
william
wordsworth
was
born
at
cockermouth
a
town
in
cumberland
england
april
he
went
to
school
at
hawkshead
lancashire
whence
in
his
seventeenth
year
he
was
sent
to
john
college
cambridge
in
january
he
took
his
degree
at
the
university
but
without
having
distinguished
himself
in
any
way
the
next
fifteen
or
sixteen
months
were
spent
in
france
just
then
in
the
first
wild
hopes
of
the
revolution
in
the
aspirations
and
hopes
of
the
revolutionists
he
was
an
ardent
sharer
he
thought
that
the
world
great
age
was
beginning
anew
and
with
all
his
soul
he
hailed
so
splendid
an
era
the
ultimate
degradation
of
that
great
movement
by
wild
lawlessness
and
then
by
most
selfish
ambition
alienated
his
sympathy
for
it
towards
the
close
of
he
returned
to
england
and
passed
the
subsequent
time
among
his
friends
in
london
and
elsewhere
till
he
settled
with
his
sister
at
racedown
dorsetshire
in
in
the
following
year
they
removed
to
alfoxden
it
was
during
this
period
that
he
made
the
acquaintance
of
coleridge
wordsworth
had
already
published
two
little
volumes
of
poetry
entitled
and
evening
but
they
showed
little
promise
of
the
triumphs
which
were
to
crown
his
later
life
in
the
first
volume
of
the
was
published
at
bristol
which
purported
to
be
the
joint
work
of
himself
and
coleridge
but
to
which
the
latter
contributed
only
the
ancient
mariner
and
two
or
three
shorter
poems
after
some
months
spent
in
germany
wordsworth
and
his
sister
established
themselves
at
grasmere
in
the
lake
country
in
he
published
the
second
volume
of
the
and
in
he
married
mary
hutchinson
from
to
he
was
mainly
busy
with
his
great
philosophical
poem
to
be
called
the
recluse
containing
views
of
man
nature
and
society
of
which
the
prelude
was
to
be
the
introduction
and
the
excursion
the
second
and
main
part
he
designed
that
his
minor
pieces
should
be
so
arranged
in
connection
with
this
work
as
to
give
them
claim
to
be
likened
to
the
little
cells
oratories
and
sepulchral
recesses
ordinarily
included
in
gothic
churches
this
plan
however
was
never
carried
out
as
of
the
first
and
third
parts
only
one
book
was
written
and
it
has
never
been
published
from
until
his
death
wordsworth
lived
serenely
and
quietly
at
rydal
mount
making
occasional
excursions
into
scotland
and
wales
and
a
tour
upon
the
continent
in
upon
the
death
of
southey
he
was
appointed
his
life
was
a
long
one
of
steady
work
and
much
happiness
he
died
april
the
distinguishing
feature
of
wordsworth
poetry
is
well
set
forth
in
his
own
words
the
moving
accident
is
not
my
trade
to
freeze
the
blood
i
have
no
ready
arts
is
my
delight
alone
in
summer
shade
to
pipe
a
simple
song
for
thinking
hearts
well
part
every
great
poet
he
said
is
a
teacher
i
wish
either
to
be
considered
as
a
teacher
or
as
nothing
and
he
avowed
that
the
purpose
of
his
poetry
was
to
console
the
afflicted
to
add
sunshine
to
daylight
by
making
the
happy
happier
to
teach
the
young
and
the
gracious
of
every
age
see
to
think
and
and
therefore
to
become
more
actively
and
securely
virtuous
love
had
he
found
in
huts
where
poor
men
lie
his
daily
teachings
had
been
woods
and
rills
the
silence
that
is
in
the
starry
sky
the
sleep
that
is
among
the
lonely
hills
wordsworth
says
john
campbell
shairp
was
the
first
who
both
in
theory
and
practice
shook
off
the
trammels
of
the
poetic
diction
which
had
tyrannized
over
english
poetry
for
more
than
a
century
this
diction
of
course
exactly
represented
the
mode
of
thinking
and
feeling
as
wordsworth
rebelled
against
this
conventionality
of
spirit
so
against
the
outward
expression
of
it
the
whole
of
the
stock
phrases
and
metaphors
he
discarded
and
returned
to
living
language
of
natural
feeling
as
it
is
used
by
men
instead
of
the
dead
form
of
it
which
had
got
stereotyped
in
books
and
just
as
in
his
subjects
he
had
taken
in
from
the
waste
much
virgin
soil
so
in
his
diction
he
appropriated
for
poetic
use
a
large
amount
of
words
idioms
metaphors
till
then
by
the
poets
disallowed
his
shorter
poems
both
the
earlier
and
the
later
are
for
the
most
part
very
models
of
natural
powerful
and
yet
sensitive
english
the
language
being
like
a
garment
woven
out
of

pray
for

naught

kneels
beneath

in

up

warriors
seized
me
yestermorn
me
even
me
a
maid
forlorn
they
choked
my
cries
with
force
and
fright
and
tied
me
on
a
palfrey
white
the
palfrey
was
as
fleet
as
wind
and
they
rode
furiously
behind
they
spurred
amain
their
steeds
were
white
and
once
we
cross
the
shade
of
night
as
sure
as
heaven
shall
rescue

i
have
no
thought
what
men
they
be
nor
do
i
know
how
long
it
is
for
i
have
lain
entranced
i
wis
since
one
the
tallest
of
the
five
took
me
from
the
palfrey
back
a
weary
woman
scarce
alive
some
mutter
words
his
comrades
spoke
he
placed
me
underneath
this
oak
he
swore
they
would
return
with
haste
whither
they
went
i
can
not
tell
i
thought
i
heard
some
minutes
past
sounds
as
of
a
castle
bell
stretch
forth
thy
hand
thus
ended
she
and
help
a
wretched
maid
to
flee
then
christabel
stretch
forth
her
hand
and
comforted
fair
geraldine
o
well
bright
dame
may
you
command
the
service
of
sir
leoline
and
gladly
our
stout
chivalry
will
he
send
forth
and
friends
withal
to
guide
and
guard
you
safe
and
free
home
to
your
noble
father
hall
she
rose
and
forth
with
steps
they
that
strove
to
be
and
were
not
fast
her
gracious
stars
the
lady
blest
and
thus
spake
on
sweet
christabel
all
our
household
are
at
rest
the
hall
is
silent
as
the
cell
sir
leoline
is
weak
in
health
and
may
not
well
awaken
be
but
we
will
move
as
if
in
stealth
and
i
beseech
your
courtesy
this
night
to
share
your
couch
with
me
they
cross
the
moat
and
christabel
took
the
key
that
fitted
well
a
little
door
she
open
straight
all
in
the
middle
of
the
gate
the
gate
that
was
iron
within
and
without
where
an
army
in
battle
array
had
march
out
the
lady
sank
belike
through
pain
and
christabel
with
might
and
main
lifted
her
up
a
weary
weight
over
the
threshold
of
the
gate
then
the
lady
rose
again
and
moved
as
she
were
not
in
pain
so
free
from
danger
free
from
fear
they
cross
the
court
right
glad
they
were
and
christabel
devoutly
cried
to
the
lady
by
her
side
praise
we
the
virgin
all
divine
who
hath
rescued
thee
from
thy
distress
alas
alas
said
geraldine
i
can
not
speak
for
weariness
so
free
from
danger
free
from
fear
they
cross
the
court
right
glad
they
were
outside
her
kennel
the
mastiff
old
lay
fast
asleep
in
moonshine
cold
the
mastiff
old
did
not
awake
yet
she
an
angry
moan
did
make
and
what
can
ail
the
mastiff
bitch
never
till
now
she
utter
yell
beneath
the
eye
of
christabel
perhaps
it
is
the
owlet
scritch
for
what
can
ail
the
mastiff
bitch
they
pass
the
hall
that
echoes
still
pass
as
lightly
as
you
will
the
brands
were
flat
the
brands
were
dying
amid
their
own
white
ashes
lying
but
when
the
lady
pass
there
came
a
tongue
of
light
a
fit
of
flame
and
christabel
saw
the
lady
eye
and
nothing
else
saw
she
thereby
save
the
boss
of
the
shield
of
sir
leoline
tall
which
hung
in
a
murky
old
niche
in
the
wall
o
softly
tread
said
christabel
my
father
seldom
sleepeth
well
sweet
christabel
her
feet
both
bare
and
jealous
of
the
listening
air
they
steal
their
way
from
stair
to
stair
now
in
glimmer
and
now
in
gloom
and
now
they
pass
the
baron
room
and
still
as
death
with
stifled
breath
and
now
have
reach
her
chamber
door
and
now
doth
geraldine
press
down
the
rushes
of
the
chamber
floor
the
moon
shines
dim
in
the
open
air
and
not
a
moonbeam
enters
here
but
they
without
its
light
can
see
the
chamber
carved
so
curiously
carved
with
figures
strange
and
sweet
all
made
out
of
the
carver
brain
for
a
lady
chamber
meet
the
lamp
with
twofold
silver
chain
is
fasten
to
an
angel
feet
the
silver
lamp
burns
dead
and
dim
but
christabel
the
lamp
will
trim
she
trimm
the
lamp
and
made
it
bright
and
left
it
swinging
to
and
fro
while
geraldine
in
wretched
plight
sank
down
upon
the
floor
below
o
weary
lady
geraldine
i
pray
you
drink
this
cordial
wine
it
is
a
wine
of
virtuous
powers
my
mother
made
it
of
wild
flowers
and
will
your
mother
pity
me
who
am
a
maiden
most
forlorn
christabel
answered
woe
is
me
she
died
the
hour
that
i
was
born
i
have
heard
the
friar
tell
how
on
her
she
did
say
that
she
should
hear
the
strike
twelve
upon
my
o
mother
dear
that
thou
wert
here
i
would
said
geraldine
she
were
but
soon
with
altered
voice
said
she
off
wandering
mother
peak
and
pine
i
have
power
to
bid
thee
flee
alas
what
ails
poor
geraldine
why
stares
she
with
unsettled
eye
can
she
the
bodiless
dead
espy
and
why
with
hollow
voice
cries
she
off
woman
off
this
hour
is
mine
though
thou
her
guardian
spirit
be
off
woman
off
is
given
to
me
then
christabel
knelt
by
the
lady
side
and
raised
to
heaven
her
eyes
so
blue
alas
said
she
this
ghastly
ride
dear
lady
it
hath
wilder
you
the
lady
wiped
her
moist
cold
brow
and
faintly
said
is
over
now
again
the
wine
she
drank
her
fair
large
eyes
glitter
bright
and
from
the
floor
whereon
she
sank
the
lofty
lady
stood
upright
she
was
most
beautiful
to
see
like
a
lady
of
a
far
countrée
and
thus
the
lofty
lady
spake
all
they
who
live
in
the
upper
sky
do
love
you
holy
christabel
and
you
love
them
and
for
their
sake
and
for
the
good
which
me
befell
even
i
in
my
degree
will
try
fair
maiden
to
requite
you
well
but
now
unrobe
yourself
for
i
must
pray
ere
yet
in
bed
i
lie
quoth
christabel
so
let
it
be
and
as
the
lady
bade
did
she
her
gentle
limbs
did
she
undress
and
lay
down
in
her
loveliness
but
through
her
brain
of
weal
and
woe
so
many
thoughts
move
to
and
fro
that
vain
it
were
her
lids
to
close
so
from
the
bed
she
rose
and
on
her
elbow
did
recline
to
look
at
the
lady
geraldine
beneath
the
lamp
the
lady
bow
and
slowly
roll
her
eyes
around
then
drawing
in
her
breath
aloud
like
one
that
shudder
she
unbound
the
cincture
from
beneath
her
breast
her
silken
robe
and
inner
vest
dropt
to
her
feet
and
full
in
view
behold
her
bosom
and
half
her
side
a
sight
to
dream
of
not
to
tell
o
shield
her
shield
sweet
christabel
yet
geraldine
nor
speaks
nor
stirs
ah
what
a
stricken
look
was
hers
deep
from
within
seems
to
lift
some
weight
with
sick
assay
and
eyes
the
maid
and
seeks
delay
then
suddenly
as
one
defied
collects
herself
in
scorn
and
pride
and
lay
down
by
the
maiden
side
and
in
her
arms
the
maid
she
took
ah
and
with
low
voice
and
doleful
look
these
words
did
say
in
the
touch
of
this
bosom
there
worketh
a
spell
which
is
lord
of
thy
utterance
christabel
thou
knowest
and
wilt
know
this
mark
of
my
shame
this
seal
of
my
sorrow
but
vainly
thou
warrest
for
this
is
alone
in
thy
power
to
declare
that
in
the
dim
forest
thou
heardest
a
low
moaning
and
foundest
a
bright
lady
surpassingly
fair
and
didst
bring
her
home
with
thee
in
love
and
in
charity
to
shield
her
and
shelter
her
from
the
damp
air
notes
the
first
part
of
the
unfinished
poem
christabel
was
written
in
the
second
part
which
however
left
the
story
apparently
as
incomplete
as
before
in
the
two
parts
were
first
published
in
the
poem
is
a
picture
of
white
innocence
purity
and
truth
pursued
and
persecuted
by
the
powers
of
evil
its
incompleteness
seems
to
enhance
its
interest
completion
could
scarcely
have
failed
to
lessen
its
reality
for
the
reader
could
not
have
endured
neither
could
the
poet
own
theory
have
endured
the
sacrifice
of
christabel
the
triumph
of
evil
over
good
and
had
she
triumphed
there
is
a
vulgar
in
victory
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
such
a
strain
such
is
the
unfinished
and
unfinishable
tale
of
christabel
a
poem
which
despite
its
broken
notes
and
has
raised
its
author
to
the
highest
rank
of
poets
and
which
in
itself
is
at
once
one
of
the
sweetest
loftiest
most
spiritual
utterances
that
has
ever
been
framed
in
english
words
we
know
of
no
existing
poem
in
any
language
to
which
we
can
compare
it
it
stands
by
itself
exquisite
celestial
ethereal
a
song
of
the
spheres
yet
full
of
such
pathos
and
tenderness
and
sorrowful
beauty
as
only
humanity
can
give
it
is
worthy
of
note
that
christabel
was
the
immediate
inspiration
of
scott
lay
of
the
last
minstrel
it
is
to
coleridge
says
sir
walter
that
i
am
bound
to
make
the
acknowledgment
due
from
the
pupil
to
his
master
but
certainly
says
hales
scott
himself
never
succeeded
in
surrounding
any
one
of
his
works
with
so
fine
an
atmosphere
of
glamour
and
romance
the
language
and
metrical
arrangement
of
this
poem
are
not
only
peculiar
but
are
in
full
accord
with
the
weird
and
fantastic
conception
of
the
piece
as
a
whole
the
versification
is
based
upon
a
principle
not
commonly
practised
that
of
counting
the
number
of
accentuated
words
in
a
line
instead
of
the
number
of
syllables
though
the
latter
varies
from
seven
to
twelve
yet
in
each
line
the
accents
never
exceed
four
the
result
is
an
irregular
but
strangely
beautiful
harmony
of
a
kind
that
can
hardly
be
attained
through
the
ordinary
methods
of
versification
this
poem
is
to
be
studied
for
its
exquisite
beauty
for
the
true
poetic
qualities
which
it
possesses
and
which
distinguish
it
from
mere
verse
hence
no
explanatory
notes
are
given
with
reference
to
any
particular
passage
nor
is
it
desirable
that
it
should
be
analyzed
with
a
view
to
grammatical
or
philological
study
it
should
be
read
and
reread
until
the
student
is
thoroughly
in
accord
with
the
poetic
spirit
which
breathes
in
and
vivifies
the
entire
production
it
was
indolence
no
doubt
that
left
the
tale
half
told
indolence
and
misery
and
a
poetic
instinct
higher
than
all
the
better
impulses
of
industry
and
virtuous
gain
the
subject
by
its
very
nature
was
incomplete
it
had
to
be
left
a
lovely
weird
suggestion
a
vision
for
every
eye
that
could
see
biographical
note
samuel
taylor
coleridge
was
born
at
ottery
saint
mary
october
he
was

at
christ
hospital
and
at
jesus
college
cambridge
at
the
age
of
he
left
the
university
without
having
taken
a
degree
he
was
an
intimate
friend
of
charles
lamb
and
southey
and
with
the
latter
formed
a
wild
scheme
for
the
founding
of
a
pantisocratic
state
in
america
which
however
was
soon
abandoned
his
first
book
of
poetry
was
published
in
in
he
and
charles
lamb
published
a
volume
of
poems
together
he
soon
afterwards
became
acquainted
with
wordsworth
and
in
the
two
brought
out
their
famous
volume
of
containing
some
of
wordsworth
best
pieces
and
coleridge
ancient
mariner
christabel
after
lying
in
manuscript
for
several
years
was
published
in
three
editions
being
issued
within
twelve
months
coleridge
chief
poems
were
published
in
in
a
collection
entitled
so
called
he
says
in
allusion
to
the
fragmentary
and
wildly
scattered
state
in
which
they
had
long
been
suffered
to
remain
at
about
the
same
time
he
was
received
into
the
house
of
gillman
a
surgeon
residing
at
highgate
in
order
to
be
cured
if
possible
of
his
excessive
use
of
opium
here
he
produced
his
more
important
prose
works
to
and
the
constitution
of
church
and
and
here
he
died
july
coleridge
was
forever
planning
and
designing
beginning
a
work
and
leaving
its
completion
until
which
never
came
he
devoted
his
attention
only
sparingly
to
poetry
and
that
chiefly
during
his
youth
later
in
life
he
was
occupied
with
political
social
and
religious
questions
he
was
a
living
hamlet
full
of
the
most
splendid
thoughts
and
the
noblest
purposes
but
a
most
incompetent
doer
his
mind
wrote
southey
is
a
perpetual
vitus
dance
eternal
activity
without
action
of
coleridge
best
verses
says
swinburne
i
venture
to
affirm
that
the
world
has
nothing
like
them
and
can
never
have
that
they
are
of
the
highest
kind
and
of
their
own
they
are
jewels
of
the
price
flowers
of
the
rose
rank
but
unlike
any
rose
or
diamond
known
his
best
work
is
but
little
says
stopford
brooke
but
of
its
kind
it
is
perfect
and
all
that
he
did
excellently
might
be
bound
up
in
twenty
pages
but
it
should
be
bound
in
pure
gold

thou
never

it
pourest
thy
full
heart
in
profuse
strains
of
unpremeditated
art
higher
still
and
higher
from
the
earth
thou
springest
like
a
cloud
of
fire
the
deep
blue
thou
wingest
and
singing
still
dost
soar
and
soaring
ever
singest
in
the
golden
lightning
of
the
sunken
sun
which
clouds
are
brightening
thou
dost
float
and
run
like
an
unbodied
joy
whose
race
is
just
begun
the
pale
purple
even
melts
around
thy
flight
like
a
star
of
heaven
in
the
broad
daylight
thou
art
unseen
but
yet
i
hear
thy
shrill
delight
keen
as
are
the
arrows
of
that
silver
sphere
whose
intense
lamp
narrows
in
the
white
dawn
clear
until
we
hardly
see
we
feel
that
it
is
there
all
the
earth
and
air
with
thy
voice
is
loud
as
when
night
is
bare
from
one
lonely
cloud
the
moon
rains
out
her
beams
and
heaven
is
overflowed
what
thou
art
we
know
not
what
is
most
like
thee
from
rainbow
clouds
there
flow
not
drops
so
bright
to
see
as
from
thy
presence
showers
a
rain
of
melody
like
a
poet
hidden
in
the
light
of
thought
singing
hymns
unbidden
till
the
world
is
wrought
to
sympathy
with
hopes
and
fears
it
heeded
not
like
a
maiden
in
a
palace
tower
soothing
her
soul
in
secret
hour
with
music
sweet
as
love
which
overflows
her
bower
like
a
golden
in
a
dell
of
dew
scattering
unbeholden
its
aërial
hue
among
the
flowers
and
grass
which
screen
it
from
the
view
like
a
rose
embowered
in
its
own
green
leaves
by
warm
winds
deflowered
till
the
scent
it
gives
makes
faint
with
too
much
sweet
these
thieves
sound
of
vernal
showers
on
the
twinkling
grass
flowers
all
that
ever
was
joyous
and
clear
and
fresh
thy
music
doth
surpass
teach
us
sprite
or
bird
what
sweet
thoughts
are
thine
i
have
never
heard
praise
of
love
or
wine
that
panted
forth
a
flood
of
rapture
so
divine
chorus
hymeneal
or
triumphal
chaunt
matched
with
thine
would
be
all
but
an
empty
vaunt
a
thing
wherein
we
feel
there
is
some
hidden
want
what
objects
are
the
fountains
of
thy
happy
strain
what
fields
or
waves
or
mountains
what
shapes
of
sky
or
plain
what
love
of
thine
own
kind
what
ignorance
of
pain
with
thy
clear
keen
joyance
langour
can
not
be
shadow
of
annoyance
never
came
near
thee
thou
lovest
but
knew
love
sad
satiety
waking
or
asleep
thou
of
death
must
deem
things
more
true
and
deep
than
we
mortals
dream
or
how
could
thy
notes
flow
in
such
a
crystal
stream
we
look
before
and
after
and
pine
for
what
is
not
our
sincerest
laughter
with
some
pain
is
fraught
our
sweetest
songs
are
those
that
tell
of
saddest
thought
yet
if
we
could
scorn
hate
and
pride
and
fear
if
we
were
things
born
not
to
shed
a
tear
i
know
not
how
thy
joy
we
ever
should
come
near
better
than
all
measures
of
delight
and
sound
better
than
all
treasures
that
in
books

this
is
perhaps
the
most
perfect
lyric
of
its
kind
in
the
english
language
every
verse
is
worthy
of
careful
study
and
it
should
be
read
and
reread
until
its
exquisite
melody
is
felt
and
the
subtle
thoughts
which
it
embodies
fully
understood
yet
there
is
little
in
the
poem
which
requires
annotation
the
lark
song
itself
admits
of
no
explanation
for
sweetness
the
to
a
skylark
is
inferior
only
to
coleridge
in
rapturous
passion
to
no
man
it
is
like
the
bird
it
sings
enthusiastic
enchanting
profuse
continuous
and
alone
small
but
filling
the
heavens
has
any
one
since
shakespeare
and
spenser
lighted
on
such
tender
and
such
grand
ecstasies
the
skylark
is
very
generally
distributed
over
the
northern
portions
of
the
old
world
but
is
not
found
in
america
its
song
in
the
morning
may
often
be
heard
when
the
bird
is
so
high
as
to
be
entirely
out
of
sight
and
although
not
finely
modulated
is
remarkably
cheerful
and
prolonged
a
person
who
is
accustomed
to
the
song
can
tell
by
its
variations
whether
it
be
ascending
stationary
or
descending
accent
here
on
the
first
syllable
from
lat
to
pour
forth
explain
the
figures
of
rhetoric
employed
in
this
line
the
meaning
of
of
the
sun
is
not
yet
above
the
horizon
but
the
bird
has
risen
so
high
that
it
is
visible
to
him
and
he
floats
and
runs
in
its
golden
light
what
is
the
meaning
of
of
in
the
next
stanza
influenced
to
work
spirit
in
the
first
stanza
he
calls
the
lark
a
spirit
and
says
it
never
was
a
bird
here
he
calls
it
bird
or
sprite

a

at

one
day
related

sad
story
of
a
beautiful
and
noble
lady
the
contessina
emilia
viviani
who
had
been
confined
by
her
father
in
a
dismal
convent
of
the
suburbs
to
await
her
marriage
with
a
distasteful
husband
shelley
fired
as
ever
by
a
tale
of
tyranny
was
eager
to
visit
the
fair
captive
the
professor
accompanied
him
and
medwin
to
the
convent
parlor
where
they
found
her
more
lovely
than
even
the
most
glowing
descriptions
had
led
them
to
expect
nor
was
she
only
beautiful
shelley
soon
discovered
that
she
had
cultivated
her
mind
beyond
what
i
have
ever
met
with
in
italian
women
and
a
rhapsody
composed
by
her
upon
the
subject
of
uranian
love
il
vero
amore
justifies
the
belief
that
she
possessed
an
intellect
of
more
than
ordinary
elevation
he
took
shelley
to
see
her
and
both
did
all
they
could
to
make
her
convent
prison
less
irksome
by
frequent
visits
by
letters
by
presents
of
flowers
and
books
it
was
not
long
before
shelley
sympathy
for
this
unfortunate
lady
took
the
form
of
love
which
however
spiritual
and
platonic
was
not
the
less
passionate
the
result
was
the
composition
of

most
unintelligible
of
all
his

assimilated

biographical
note
percy
bysshe
shelley
was
born
at
field
place
near
horsham
in
sussex
august
he
was
educated
at
eton
and
at
oxford
while
a
student
at
the
latter
place
he
wrote
a
pamphlet
entitled
necessity
of
which
caused
his
expulsion
from
college
this
occurred
in
and
in
the
same
year
he
married
harriet
westbrook
from
whom
three
years
later
he
separated
in
he
married
mary
godwin
in
he
left
england
for
italy
where
he
remained
until
his
death
by
drowning
in
the
gulf
of
spezia
july
his
first
considerable
poem
queen
mab
was
published
in
alastor
or
the
spirit
of
solitude
in
the
revolt
of
islam
in
and
epipsychidion
and
adonais
in
his
two
dramas
the
cenci
and
prometheus
unbound
were
issued
the
former
in
the
latter
in
shelley
early
rupture
with
the
english
world
says
hales
lost
him
all
the
advantages
which
a
fuller
experience
of
it
and
a
longer
intercourse
with
it
might
have
given
that
world
was
no
less
estranged
from
him
than
he
from
it
it
misunderstood
and
misinterpreted
him
throughout
his
career
it
covered
him
with
its
opprobrium
assuredly
he
was
not
the
man
that
world
painted
it
by
no
means
follows
that
because
shelley
did
not
repeat
the
ordinary
creeds
and
even
mocked
at
them
that
he
believed
nothing
shelley
was
never
in
his
soul
an
atheist
it
was
simply
impossible
with
his
nature
that
he
should
be
what
he
did
deny
and
defy
was
a
deity
whose
worship
seemed
as
he
saw
the
world
consistent
with
the
reign
of
selfishness
and
bigotry
lord
macaulay
says
we
doubt
whether
any
modern
poet
has
possessed
in
an
equal
degree
some
of
the
highest
qualities
of
the
great
ancient
masters
the
words
and
which
seem
so
cold
and
affected
when
applied
to
other
modern
writers
have
a
perfect
propriety
when
applied
to
him
he
was
not
an
author
but
a
bard
his
poetry
seems
not
to
have
been
an
art
but
an
inspiration
had
he
lived
to
the
full
age
of
man
he
might
not
improbably
have
given
to
the
world
some
great
work
of
the
very
highest
rank
in
design
and
execution
leigh
hunt
says
assuredly
had
he
lived
he
would
have
been
the
greatest
dramatic
writer
since
the
days
of
elizabeth
in
general
if
coleridge
is
the
sweetest
of
our
poets
shelley
is
at
once
the
most
ethereal
and
most
gorgeous
the
one
who
has
clothed
his
thoughts
in
draperies
of
the
most
evanescent
and
most
magnificent
words
and
imagery
his
poetry
is
as
full
of
mountains
seas
and
skies
of
light
and
darkness
and
the
seasons
and
all
the
elements
of
our
being
as
if
nature
herself
had
written
it
with
the
creation
and
its
hopes
newly
cast
around
her
not
it
must
be
confessed
without
too
indiscriminate
a
mixture
of
great
and
small
and
a
want
of
sufficient
shade
a
certain
chaotic
brilliancy
with
excess
of
light
another
english
poet
says
shelley
outsang
all
poets
on
record
but
some
two
or
three
throughout
all
time
his
depths
and
heights
of
inner
and
outer
music
are
as
divine
as
nature
and
not
sooner
exhaustible
he
was
alone
the
perfect
his
thoughts
words
deeds
all
sang
together
the
poet
who
creates
a
new
ideal
and
fills
men
hearts
with
the
flame
of
a
divine
desire
is
a
practical
force
in
the
stream
of
human
development
and
this
shelley
has
done
so
much
of
his
poetry
is
full
of
the
tender
melancholy
of
the
moonlight
he
loved
that
the
world
is
still
half
blind
to
his
highest
bardic
character
as
the
poet
of
a
spiritual
dawn
the
eager
spirit
who
flies
forward
calling
the
lapsèd
soul
and
weeping
in
the
morning
dew
even
his
moonlight
seems
to
reflect
the
beams
of
some
unrisen
sun
and
his
sunlight
has
all
the
ethereal
exhilaration
of

it
chanced
to
wake
into
a
slumberous
tenderness
which
when
he
heard
that
minute
did
he
bless
and
breathed
himself
then
from
the
closet
crept
noiseless
as
fear
in
a
wide
wilderness
and
over
the
hushed
carpet
silent
stept
and
the
curtains
peeped
where
lo
how
fast
she
slept

by

where

made

she
slept
an
sleep
in

linen
smooth
and

from
forth

brought
a
heap
of

with

bright
of
wreathed

stand
in
the

of

fair
awake
thou
art

i
thine

thine

for

shall
drowse

thus
whispering
his
warm
unnerved
arm
sank
in
her
pillow
shaded
was
her
dream
by
the
dusk
curtains
was
a
midnight
charm
impossible
to
melt
as

never

redeem
from

spell
his

eyes
so
mused
awhile
entoiled
in
woofed
phantasies
awakening
up
he
took
her
hollow
lute
tumultuous
and
in
chords
that
tenderest
be
he
play
an
ancient
ditty
long
since
mute
in
provence
called
la
belle
dame
sans

close
to
her
ear
touching
the
melody
wherewith
disturbed
she
uttered
a
soft
moan
he
ceased
she
panted
quick
and
suddenly
her
blue
affrayed
eyes
wide
open
shone
upon
his
knees
he
sank
pale
as
stone
her
eyes
were
open
but
she
still
beheld
now
wide
awake
the
vision
of
her
sleep
there
was
a
painful
change
that
nigh
expelled
the
blisses
of
her
dream
so
pure
and
deep
at
which
fair
madeline
began
to
weep
and
moan
forth
witless
words
with
many
a
sigh
while
still
her
gaze
on
porphyro
would
keep
who
knelt
with
joined
hands
and
piteous
eye
fearing
to
move
or
speak
she
looked
so
dreamingly
ah
porphyro
said
she
but
even
now
thy
voice
was
at
sweet
tremble
in
mine
ear
made
tuneable
with
every
sweetest
vow
and
those
sad
eyes
were
spiritual
and
clear
how
changed
thou
art
how
pallid
chill
and
drear
give
me
that
voice
again
my
porphyro
those
looks
immortal
those
complainings
dear
oh
leave
me
not
in
this
eternal
woe
for
if
thou
diest
my
love
i
know
not
where
to
go
beyond
a
mortal
man
impassioned
far
at
these
voluptuous
accents
he
arose
ethereal
flushed
and
like
a
throbbing
star
seen
the
sapphire
heaven
deep
repose
into
her
dream
he
melted
as
the
rose
blendeth
its
odor
with
the
violet
solution
sweet
meantime
the
blows
like
love
alarum
pattering
the
sharp
sleet
against
the

hath
set

dark
quick

my
madeline
is
dark
the

gusts
still
rave
and
beat
no
dream
alas
alas
and
woe
is
mine
porphyro
will
leave
me
here
to
fade
and
cruel
what
traitor
could
thee
hither
bring
i
curse
not
for
my
heart
is
lost
in
thine
though
thou
forsakest
a
deceived
thing
a
dove
forlorn
and
lost
with
sick
unpruned
wing
my
madeline
sweet
dreamer
lovely
bride
say
may
i
be
for
aye
thy
vassal
blest
thy
beauty
shield
and
vermeil

here
will
i
take
my
rest
after
so
many
hours
of
toil
and
quest
a
famished
pilgrim
saved
by
miracle
though
i
have
found
i
will
not
rob
thy
nest
saving
of
thy
sweet
self
if
thou
well
to
trust
fair
madeline
to
no
rude
infidel
hark
is
an
from
faery
land
of
haggard
seeming
but
a
boon
indeed
arise
arise
the
morning
is
at
hand
the
bloated
wassailers
will
never
heed
let
us
away
my
love
with
happy
speed
there
are
no
ears
to
hear
or
eyes
to
see
drowned
all
in
rhenish
and
the
sleepy
mead
awake
arise
my
love
and
fearless
be
for
the

i
have
a
home
for
thee
she
hurried
at
his
words
beset
with
fears
for
there
were
sleeping
dragons
all
around
at
glaring
watch
perhaps
with
ready
spears
down
the
wide
stairs
a
darkling
way
they
found
in
all
the
house
was
heard
no

sound
a
lamp
was
flickering
by

the
arras
rich
with
horseman
hawk
and

fluttered
in
the
besieging
wind
uproar
and
the
long
carpets
rose
along
the
gusty
floor
they
glide
like
phantoms
into
the
wide
hall
like
phantoms
to
the
iron
porch
they
glide
where
lay
the
porter
in
uneasy
sprawl
with
a
huge
empty
flagon
by
his
side
the
wakeful
bloodhound
rose
and
shook
his
hide
but
his
sagacious
eye
an

owns
by

biographical
note
john
keats
was
born
october
in
moorfields
london
he
was
sent
to
school
at
enfield
where
he
gained
the
rudiments
of
a
classical
education
but
his
father
having
died
when
john
was
a
mere
child
he
was
apprenticed
at
an
early
age
to
a
surgeon
in
edmonton
when
seventeen
years
old
a
copy
of
spenser
faerie
queene
fell
into
his
hands
and
the
perusal
of
that
great
poem
was
the
beginning
for
him
of
a
new
life
he
felt
the
poetic
instinct
within
him
and
resolved
that
he
too
would
be
a
poet
in
he
published
a
small
volume
of
poems
which
attracted
but
little
attention
and
in
his
more
ambitious
effort
endymion
was
presented
to
the
world
the
latter
poem
was
unkindly
received
by
the
great
reviews
the
author
was
advised
to
go
back
to
his
gallipots
and
told
that
a
starved
apothecary
was
better
than
a
starved
poet
a
story
was
long
current
that
these
severe
criticisms
induced
keats
early
death
but
this
is
entirely
improbable
he
continued
writing
although
consumption
a
hereditary
disease
in
his
family
had
already
begun
its
work
upon
him
he
published
the
eve
of
agnes
in
and
had
made
some
progress
with
a
noble
poem
entitled
hyperion
which
lord
byron
declared
to
be
actually
inspired
by
the
titans
and
as
sublime
as
æschylus
in
september
of
that
year
he
sailed
for
italy
but
the
hope
of
prolonging
life
by
a
change
of
climate
proved
to
be
vain
on
the
of
february
he
died
at
rome
we
can
hardly
be
wrong
in
believing
says
masson
that
had
keats
lived
to
the
ordinary
age
of
man
he
would
have
been
one
of
the
greatest
of
all
our
poets
as
it
is
i
believe
we
shall
all
be
disposed
to
place
him
very
near
indeed
to
our
very
best
that
which
was
deepest
in
his
mind
says
stopford
brooke
was
the
love
of
loveliness
for
its
own
sake
the
sense
of
its
rightful
and
power
and
in
the
singleness
of
worship
which
he
gave
to
beauty
keats

the

in
the
eighteenth
century
influence
of
the
poetry
of
the
past
lasted
new
elements
were
added
to
poetry
and
new
forms
of
it
took
shape
the
study
of
the
greek
and
latin
classics
revived
and
with
it
a
more
artistic
poetry
not
only
correct
form
for
which
pope
sought
but
beautiful
form
was
sought
after
men
like
thomas
gray
and
william
collins
strove
to
pour
into
their
work
that
simplicity
of
beauty
which
the
greek
poets
and
italians
like
petrarca
had
reached
as
the
last
result
of
genius
restrained
by
two
things
had
been
learned
first
that
artistic
rules
were
necessary
and
secondly
that
natural
feeling
was
necessary
in
order
that
poetry
should
have
a
style
fitted
to
express
nobly
the
emotions
and
thoughts
of
man
the
way
was
therefore
now
made
ready
for
a
style
in
which
the
art
should
itself
be
nature
and
it
sprang
at
once
into
being
in
the
work
of
the
poets
of
this
time
the
style
of
gray
is
polished
to
the
finest
point
and
yet
it
is
instinct
with
natural
feeling
goldsmith
is
natural
even
to
simplicity
and
yet
his
verse
is
even
more
accurate
than
pope
cowper
style
in
such
poems
as
the
to
my
picture
arises
out
of
the
simplest
pathos
and
yet
it
is
as
pure
in
expression
as
greek
stopford
brooke
last
there
started
up
an
unfortunate
scotch
peasant
burns
rebelling
against
the
world
and
in
love
with
the
yearnings

greatness
and
irrationality
of

genius
now

then
behind

notes
this
poem
composed
in
is
written
partly
in
the
scottish
dialect
partly
in
english
the
livelier
passages
are
in
the
poet
vernacular
the
loftier
or
more
solemn
parts
in
the
language
of
books
this
distinction
was
doubtless
made
because
burns
disliked
to
treat
his
higher
themes
in
a
merely
colloquial
manner
fearing
to
belittle
them
by
so
doing
the
household
described
was
probably
that
of
the
poet
own
father
it
was
at
least
a
typical
scotch
peasant
household
with
which
no
one
was
more
familiar

burns
in
a
letter
to

says
although
the
in
the
saturday
night
is
an
exact
copy
of
my
father
in
his
manners
his
family
devotions
and
exhortations
yet
the
other
parts
of
the
description
do
not
apply
to
our
family
none
of
us
ever
went
service
out
amang
the
neibors
roun
instead
of
our
depositing
our
with
our
parents
my
father
labored
hard
and
lived
with
the
most
rigid
economy
that
he
might
be
able
to
keep
his
children
at
home
the
influence
of
gray
and
goldsmith
is
very
apparent
in
more
than
one
passage
in
this
poem
robert
had
frequently
remarked
to
me
said
his
brother
that
there
was
something
particularly
venerable
in
the
phrase
us
worship
god
used
by
a
decent
sober
head
of
a
family
introducing
family
worship
to
this
sentiment
of
the
author
the
world
is
indebted
for
cotter
saturday
night
the
hint
of
the
plan
and
title
of
the
poem
is
taken
from
ferguson
ingle
one
who
inhabits
a
cot
or
cottage
dependent
on
a
farm
a
friend
with
whom
burns
had
been
brought
into
contact
during
the
old
and
new
light
controversy
see
gray
elegy
in
a
country
churchyard
eighth
stanza
songs
probably
from
the
same
root
as
the
german
the
word
was
originally
applied
to
a
form
of
elegiac
french
poetry
much
imitated
by
the
english
a
favorite
word
with
the
poets
at
this
time
goldsmith
uses
it
no
fewer
than
six
times
in
the
deserted
village
the
original
meaning
is
something
drawn
along
from
lat
to
draw
also
spelled
whistling
sound
murmur
derived
from
the
same
root
as
sigh
for
which
word
it
is
used
by
burns
in
his
lines
on

battle
of
sherriffmuir

follow
probably
not
from

uses
it

cattle
says
bosworth
was
the
first
kind
of
property
and
by
bartering
this
word
came
to
signify
money
in
general
so
too
the
word
is
from
icelandic
cattle
the
word
as
in
this
country
the
word
is
used
indefinitely
for
observe
that
in
quoting
the
words
of
the
cotter
the
poet
partially
drops
the
ayrshire
dialect
and
uses
a
purer
english
within
the
inner
part
of
the
house
from
within
its
opposite
is
the
outside
of
the
house
cattle
from
or
is
derived
from
the
same
root
and
probably
this
word
says
hales
denotes
properly
a
cow
with
a
white
face
so
in
northumberland
was
used
of
an
animal
with
a
white
spot
on

biographical
note
robert
burns
was
born
in
ayrshire
scotland
in
his
childhood
and
youth
were
spent
in
poverty
on
his
father
farm
where
he
learned
to
plough
reap
mow
and
thresh
in
the
barn
but
where
opportunities
for
education
were
such
only
as
scottish
peasants
know
in
his
father
died
and
he
attempted
to
manage
a
farm
of
his
own
at
mossgiel
the
experiment
proving
to
be
a
failure
he
resolved
to
leave
scotland
and
secured
an
appointment
to
a
clerkship
in
jamaica
just
before
the
time
set
for
his
departure
he
learned
of
the
success
of
a
volume
of
his
poems
which
had
just
been
published
at
kilmarnock
and
instead
of
departing
for
the
west
indies
he
made
a
visit
to
edinburgh
he
was
welcomed
by
the
best
society
and
received
at
once
into
the
literary
circles
of
the
scottish
capital
his
name
and
fame
flashed
like
sunshine
over
the
land
the
shepherd
on
the
hill
the
maiden
at
her
wheel
learned
his
songs
by
heart
and
the
first
scholars
of
scotland
courted
his
acquaintance
a
second
edition
of
his
poems
was
published
in
and
with
the
proceeds
about
he
took
a
farm
at
ellisland
in
nithsdale
but
his
habits
were
such
that
he
made
sad
failure
a
second
time
in
the
experiment
of
farming
and
after
two
years
of
mismanagement
to
eke
out
his
scanty
income
he
accepted
an
appointment
as
exciseman
in
unfortunately
both
for
his
health
and
for
his
reputation
he
removed
to
dumfries
where
five
years
later
he
died
while
the
shakespeares
and
miltons
roll
on
like
mighty
rivers
through
the
country
of
thought
bearing
fleets
of
traffickers
and
assiduous
on
their
waves
this
little
valclusa
fountain
will
also
arrest
our
eye
for
this
also
is
of
nature
own
and
most
cunning
workmanship
bursts
from
the
depths
of
the
earth
with
a
full
gushing
current
into
the
light
of
day
and
often
will
the
traveller
turn
aside
to
drink
of
its
clear
waters
and
muse
among
its
rocks
and
pines
burns
is
not
the
poet
poet
which
shelley
no
doubt
meant
to
be
or
the
philosopher
poet
which
wordsworth
in
spite
of
himself
is
he
is
the
poet
of
homely
human
nature
not
half
so
homely
or
prosaic
as
it
seems
his
genius
in
a
manner
all
its
own
associates
itself
with
the
fortunes
experiences
memorable
moments
of
human
beings
whose
humanity
is
their
sole
patrimony
to
whom
and
whatever
like
liberty
has
the
power
to
raise
a
man
above
the
brute
and
mak
him
ken
himsel
is
their
portion
in
life
for
whom
the
great
epochs
and
phases
of
existence
are
those
which
are
occasioned
by
emotions
inseparable
from
the
consciousness
of
existence
for
the
great
majority
of
his
readers
and
therefore
for
the
mass
of
human
beings
the
sympathy
which
exists
between
him
and
them
is
sympathy
relative
to
their
strongest
and
deepest
feelings
and
this
is
sympathy
out
of
which
personal
affection
naturally
springs
and
in
the
strength
of
which
it
can
not
but
grow
strong
burns
was
not
like
shakespeare
in
the
range
of
his
genius
but
there
is
something
of
the
same
magnanimity
directness
and
unaffected
character
about
him
with
but
little
of
shakespeare
imagination
or
inventive
power
he
had
the
same
life
of
mind
within
the
narrow
circle
of
personal
feeling
or
domestic
incidents
the
pulse
of
his
poetry
flows
as
healthily
and
vigorously
he
had
an
eye
to
see
a
heart
to
feel
no
more
his
pictures
of
good
fellowship
of
social
life
of
quaint
humor
are
equal
to
anything
they
come
up
to
nature
and
they
can
not
go
beyond
it
his
is
that
language
of
the
heart
in
which
the
answering
heart
would
speak
thought
word
that
bids
the
warm
tear
start
or
the
smile
light
the
cheek
and
his
that
music
to
whose
tone

common
pulse
of

boadicea
was
queen
of
the
iceni
a
powerful
and
warlike
tribe
of
britons
about
the
middle
of
the
first
century
upon
the
death
of
her
husband
prasutagus
her
kingdom
was
seized
by
the
romans
and
she
herself
for
some
real
or
imaginary
offence
was
publicly
scourged
during
the
absence
of
the
roman
governor
from
that
part
of
england
boadicea
raised
an
immense
army
burned
the
city
of
london
and
put
romans
to
the
sword
she
afterwards
with
troops
met
the
roman
army
under
suetonius
in
the
field
and
although
the
romans
could
muster
only
soldiers
the
british
army
was
defeated
and
the
queen
in
despair
ended
her
own
life
by
taking
poison
in
this
poem
cowper
represents
the
queen
as
soon
after
her
shameful
treatment
by
the
romans
seeking
counsel
from
one
of
the
native
priests
the
druid
prophesies
the
destruction
of
rome
and
the
future
greatness
of
britain
not
does
the
poet
allude
to
the
cultivation
of
oratory
and
poetry
among
the
romans
and
the
neglect
of
military
affairs
with
thunder
clad
with

these
expressions

what
do
they
refer

the
prophecy
included
in
this
stanza
hurled
what
this
stanza
evidently
a
part
of
the
imprecation
which
boadicea
hurled
at
her
enemies
ought
to
be
enclosed
with
quotation
marks
but
in
most
versions
of
the
poem
it
appears
without
them
on
the
receipt
of
my
mother
picture
oh
that
those
lips
had
language
life
has
passed
with
me
but
roughly
since
i
heard
thee
last
those
lips
are
thine
thy
own
sweet
smile
i
see
the
same
that
oft
in
childhood
solaced
me
voice
only
fails
else
how
distinct
they
say
grieve
not
my
child
chase
all
thy
fears
away
the
meek
intelligence
of
those
dear
eyes
blessed
be
the
art
that
can
immortalize
the
art
that
baffles
time
tyrannic
claim
to
quench
it
here
shines
on
me
still
the
same
faithful
remembrancer
of
one
so
dear
o
welcome
guest
though
unexpected
here
who
bidst
me
honor
with
an
artless
song
affectionate
a
mother
lost
so
long
i
will
obey
not
willingly
alone
but
gladly
as
the
precept
were
her
own
and
while
that
face
renews
my
filial
grief
fancy
shall
weave
a
charm
for
my
relief
shall
steep
me
in
elysian
reverie
a
momentary
dream
that
thou
art
she
my
mother
when
i
learnt
that
thou
wast
dead
say
wast
thou
conscious
of
the
tears
i
shed
hovered
thy
spirit
thy
sorrowing
son
wretch
even
then
life
journey
just
begun
perhaps
thou
gavest
me
though
unfelt
a
kiss
perhaps
a
tear
if
souls
can
weep
in
bliss
ah
that
maternal
smile
it
answers
yes
i
heard
the
bell
tolled
on
thy
burial
day
i
saw
the
hearse
that
bore
thee
slow
away
and
turning
from
my
nursery
window
drew
a
long
long
sigh
and
wept
a
last
adieu
but
was
it
such
it
where
thou
art
gone
adieus
and
farewells
are
a
sound
unknown
may
i
but
meet
thee
on
that
peaceful
shore
the
parting
word
shall
pass
my
lips
no
more
the
maidens
grieved
themselves
at
my
concern
oft
gave
me
promise
of
thy
quick
return
what
ardently
i
wished
i
long
believed
and
disappointed
still
was
still
deceived
by
expectation
every
day
beguiled
dupe
of
even
from
a
child
thus
many
a
sad
came
and
went
till
all
my
stock
of
infant
sorrow
spent
i
learned
at
last
submission
to
my
lot
but
though
i
less
deplored
thee
forgot
where
once
we
dwelt
our
name
is
heard
no
more
children
not
thine
have
trod
my
nursery
floor
and
where
the
gardener
robin
day
by
day
drew
me
to
school
along
the
public
way
delighted
with
my
bauble
coach
and
wrapped
in
scarlet
mantle
warm
and
velvet
capped
is
now
become
a
history
little
known
that
once
we
called
the
pastoral
house
our
own
possession
but
the
record
fair
that
memory
keeps
of
all
thy
kindness
there
still
outlives
many
a
storm
that
has
effaced
a
thousand
other
themes
less
deeply
traced
thy
nightly
visits
to
my
chamber
made
that
thou
mightst
know
me
safe
and
warmly
laid
thy
morning
bounties
ere
i
left
my
home
the
biscuit
or
confectionary
plum
the
fragrant
waters
on
my
cheek
bestowed
by
thy
own
hand
till
fresh
they
shone
and
glowed
all
this
and
more
endearing
still
than
all
thy
constant
flow
of
love
that
knew
no
fall
roughened
by
those
cataracts
and
brakes
that
humor
interposed
too
often
makes
all
this
still
legible
in
memory
page
and
still
to
be
so
to
my
latest
age
adds
joy
to
duty
makes
me
glad
to
pay
such
honors
to
thee
as
my
numbers
may
perhaps
a
frail
memorial
but
sincere
not
scorned
in
heaven
though
little
noticed
here
could
time
his
flight
reversed
restore
the
hours
when
playing
with
thy
vesture
tissued
flowers
the
violet
the
pink
and
jessamine
i
pricked
them
into
paper
with
a
pin
and
thou
wast
happier
than
myself
the
while
wouldst
softly
speak
and
stroke
my
head
and
smile
could
those
few
pleasant
days
again
appear
might
one
wish
bring
them
would
i
wish
them
here
i
would
not
trust
my
heart
the
dear
delight
seems
so
to
be
desired
perhaps
i
but
no
what
here
we
call
our
life
is
such
so
little
to
be
loved
and
thou
so
much
that
i
should
ill
requite
thee
to
constrain
thy
unbound
spirit
into
bonds
again
thou
as
a
gallant
bark
from
albion
coast
the
storms
all
weathered
and
the
ocean
crossed
shoots
into
port
at
some
isle
where
spices
breathe
and
brighter
seasons
smile
there
sits
quiescent
on
the
floods
that
show
her
beauteous
form
reflected
clear
below
while
airs
impregnated
with
incense
play
around
her
fanning
light
her
streamers
gay
so
thou
with
sails
how
swift
hast
reached
the
shore
where
tempests
never
beat
nor
billows
roar
and
thy
loved
consort
on
the
dangerous
tide
of
life
long
since
has
anchored
by
thy
side
but
me
scarce
hoping
to
attain
that
rest
always
from
port
withheld
always
distressed
me
howling
blasts
drive
devious
tempest
tost
sails
ripped
seams
opening
wide
and
compass
lost
and
day
by
day
some
current
thwarting
force
sets
me
more
distant
from
a
prosperous
course
yet
oh
the
thought
that
thou
art
safe
and
he
that
thought
is
joy
arrive
what
may
to
me
my
boast
is
not
that
i
deduce
my
birth
from
loins
enthroned
and
rulers
of
the
earth
but
higher
far
my
proud
pretensions
rise
the
son
of
parents
passed
into
the
skies
and
now
farewell
time
unrevoked
has
run
his
wonted
course
yet
what
i
wished
is
done
by
contemplation
help
not
sought
in

i
seem
to
have
lived
my
childhood
again
to
have
renewed
the
joys
that
once
were
mine
without
the
sin
of
violating
thine
and
while
the
wings
of
fancy
still
are
free

i

notes
this
one
of
the
most
exquisite
poems
in
the
language
was
written
by
cowper
in
the
last
glimmering
of
the
evening
light
before
his
mind
was
wholly
overwhelmed
by
the
final
attack
of
insanity
every
line
is
instinct
with
a
profound
and
chastened
feeling
to
which
it
would
be
difficult
to
find
a
parallel
there
is
not
a
phrase
not
a
word
which
jars
upon
the
most
susceptible
ear
not
a
tinge
of
exaggeration
not
a
touch
that
is
excessive
the
fact
that
he
who
gave
forth
these
supreme
utterances
of
filial
love
was
old
himself
when
he
did
it
brings
into
the
relationship
a
strange
tender
equality
which
is
marvellously
touching

from
ger
from
the
same
root

might
with
equal
veracity
say
a
day
in
which
i
do
not
think
of

such
was
the
impression
her
tenderness
made
upon
me
though
the
opportunity
she
had
for
showing
it
was
so
short
perhaps
the
gravest
fault
in
this
poem
is
the
frequent
intermixture
as
in
these
two
lines
of
trivial
thoughts
and
circumstances
with
those
of
a
more
noble
character

metaphor

poet

his
grave
biographical
note
william
cowper
was
born
at
great
berkhamstead
november
his
father
was
the
rector
of
the
parish
and
his
mother
was
ann
donne
of
the
family
of
the
famous
john
donne
cowper
was
educated
at
a
private
school
and
afterwards
at
westminster
it
was
intended
that
he
should
follow
the
profession
of
law
and
after
the
completion
of
his
studies
at
westminster
he
entered
the
middle
temple
and
was
articled
to
a
solicitor
at
the
age
of
through
the
influence
of
his
uncle
major
cowper
he
was
appointed
to
two
clerkships
in
the
house
of
lords
the
excitement
brought
on
by
this
occurrence
together
with
an
unhappy
love
affair
induced
an
attack
of
insanity
from
which
he
suffered
for
more
than
a
year
in
he
suffered
from
a
second
attack
of
insanity
which
continued
for
sixteen
months
it
was
not
until
when
in
his
fiftieth
year
that
he
began
really
to
write
poetry
his
first
volume
was
published
in
and
comprised
besides
several
shorter
pieces
the
three
poems
conversation
retirement
and
table
talk
his
second
volume
appeared
in
and
contained
the
task
tirocinium
and
the
ballad
of
john
gilpin
which
had
already
become
famous
through
the
recitations
of
one
henderson
an
actor
cowper
translation
of
homer
was
completed
and
published
in
from
that
time
until
his
death
in
he
suffered
from
hopeless
dejection
regarding
himself
as
an
object
of
divine
wrath
a
condemned
and
forsaken
outcast
cowper
was
not
a
great
poet
but
he
was
the
first
to
abandon
the
mechanical
versification
and
conventional
phrases
of
the
artificial
poets
to
find
inspiration
and
guidance
in
nature
it
may
be
said
that
he
lacked
creative
power
but
he
possessed
a
quickness
of
thought
a
depth
of
feeling
and
a
certain
manliness
and
sincerity
which
lifted
him
above
the
level
of
the
ordinary
versifiers
of
his
time

be

down

his

his
heart
his

his
griefs
were
given
but
all
his
serious
thoughts
had
rest
in
heaven
as
some
tall
cliff
that
lifts
its
awful
form
swells
from

midway

with

at

for

full

the

circling
round
conveyed
the
dismal

when
he

yet
he
was
kind

if

in

the
love
he
bore

was
in

amazed
the

ranged

still

still
the
wonder
grew
that

of

seem
to
have
been
to
us
the
whole
character
seems
traced
as
it
were
in
an
expiatory
spirit
as
if
conscious
of
his
own
wandering
restlessness
he
sought
to
humble
himself
at
the
shrine
of

which
he
had
not

the
simile
included
in

four
lines
says
lord
lytton
is
translated
almost
literally
from
a
poem
by
the
abbé
de
chaulieu
who
died
in
every
one
must

adds
he
that
in
copying
goldsmith
wonderfully
improved
the
original
village
the
portrait
here
drawn
of
the
village
schoolmaster
is
from
goldsmith
own
teacher
thomas
byrne
with
whom
he
was
placed
when
six
years
old
byrne
had
been
educated
for
a
pedagogue
says
irving
but
had
enlisted
in
the
army
served
abroad
during
the
wars
of
queen
anne
time
and
risen
to
the
rank
of
quartermaster
of
a
regiment
in
spain
at
the
return
of
peace
having
no
longer
exercise
for
the
sword
he
resumed
the
ferule
and
drilled
the
urchin
populace
of
lissoy
there
are
certain
whimsical
traits
in
the
character
of
byrne
not
given
in
the
foregoing
sketch
he
was
fond
of
talking
of
his
vagabond
wanderings
in
foreign
lands
and
had
brought
with
him
from
the
wars
a
world
of
campaigning
stories
of
which
he
was
generally
the
hero
and
which
he
would
deal
forth
to
his
wondering
scholars
when
he
ought
to
have
been
teaching
them
their
lessons
these
travellers
tales
had
a
powerful
effect
upon
the
vivid
imagination
of
goldsmith
and
awakened
an
unconquerable
passion
for
wandering
and
seeking
adventure
byrne
was
moreover
of
a
romantic
vein
and
exceedingly
superstitious
he
was
deeply
versed
in
the
fairy
superstitions
which
abound
in
ireland
all
which
he
professed
implicitly
to
believe
under
his
tuition
goldsmith
soon
became
almost
as
great
a
proficient
in
fairy
lore
the
was
a
noisy
place
the
pupils
studying
their
lessons
aloud
and
but
little
care
being
taken
to
secure
quietness
at
any
time
foreboding
seeing
that
which

the
naturalness
and
ease
of
goldsmith
poetry
says
edward
dowden
are
those
of
an
accomplished
craftsman
his
verse
which
flows
towards
the
close
of
the
period
with
such
a
gentle
yet
steady
advance
is
not
less
elaborated
than
that
of
pope
and
goldsmith
conceived
his
verse
more
in
paragraphs
than
in
couplets
his
artless
words
were
each
one
delicately
chosen
his
simple
constructions
were
studiously
sought
and
sir
walter
scott
said
of
him
it
would
be
difficult
to
point
out
one
among
the
english
poets
less
likely
to
be
excelled
in
his
own
style
possessing
much
of
pope
versification
without
the
monotonous
structure
of
his
lines
rising
sometimes
to
the
swell
and

of

alike
successful
in

he
may
long

notes
this
poem
was
published
in
it
is
founded
says
gray
on
a
tradition
current
in
wales
that
edward
when
he
completed
the
conquest
of
that
country
ordered
all
the
bards
that
fell
into
his
hands
to
be
put
to
death
the
argument
is
as
follows
the
army
of
edward
as
they
march
through
a
deep
valley
and
approach
mount
snowdon
are
suddenly
stopped
by
the
appearance
of
a
venerable
figure
seated
on
the
summit
of
an
inaccessible
rock
who
with
a
voice
more
than
human
reproaches
the
king
with
all
the
desolation
and
misery
which
he
had
brought
on
his
country
foretells
the
misfortunes
of
the
norman
race
and
with
prophetic
spirit
declares
that
all
his
cruelty
shall
never
extinguish
the
noble
ardor
of
poetic
genius
in
this
island
and
that
men
shall
never
be
wanting
to
celebrate
true
virtue
and
valor
in
immortal
strains
to
expose
vice
and
infamous
pleasure
and
boldly
censure
tyranny
and
oppression
his
song
ended
he
precipitates
himself
from
the
mountain
and
is
swallowed
up
by
the
river
that
rolls
at
its
feet
the
tradition
upon
which
the
poem
is
said
to
be
founded
if
it
ever
had
any
existence
is
in
great
part
mythical
edward
did
indeed
conquer
wales
but
there
is
no
evidence
that
he
massacred
or
even
persecuted
the
welsh
bards
a
hundred
years
after
his
time
their
number
and
influence
had
not
been
diminished
this
poem
is
a
good
example
of
an
english
ode
constructed
strictly
after
greek
models
it
will
be
observed
that
it
is
written
not
in
uniform
stanzas
but
in
three
uniform
parts
each
of
which
contains
three
stanzas
the
first
of
these
parts
is
called
the
or
turn
the
second
the
or
the
third
the
or
the
origin
of
these
terms
may
be
traced
to
the
use
of
the
ode
as
an
important
part
of
the
entertainment
presented
in
the
ancient
greek
theatre
the
strophe
was
sung
while
the
chorus
moved
from
one
side
of
the
orchestra
to
the
other
the
antistrophe
while
the
reversed
movement
was
being
made
and
the
epodos
after
the
singers
had
returned
to
their
original
position
the
accurate
perception
of
harmony
and
the
relationship
between
the
different
parts
of
the
choral
ode
which
enabled
the
greeks
to
enter
thoroughly
into
its
enjoyment
is
unknown
among
moderns
hence
there
have
been
but
few
attempts
in
the
english
language
to
construct
odes
strictly
after
the
greek
model
most
of
our
odes
are
poems
relating
to
themes
of
greater
or
less
varying
length
and
divided
into
many
irregular
stanzas
of
varying
lengths
and
metres
such
are
dryden
alexander
feast
keats
ode
to
a
nightingale
and
wordsworth
ode
on
the
intimations
of
immortality
all
of
which
are
odes
in
form
and
style
although
differing
from
their
greek
prototype
and
from
one

the

biographical
note
thomas
gray
was
born
in
cornhill
london
december
through
the
help
of
his
mother
brother
who
was
at
that
famous
school
he
received
his
primary
education
at
eton
and
in
entered
peter
college
cambridge
in
he
left
the
university
without
taking
a
degree
intending
to
study
law
at
the
inner
temple
soon
afterwards
however
he
accompanied
horace
walpole
on
a
tour
through
france
and
italy
and
spent
the
greater
part
of
two
years
in
paris
rome
and
florence
upon
his
return
to
england
finding
himself
possessed
of
a
competency
he
resolved
to
give
up
the
law
and
devote
himself
entirely
to
he
settled
at
cambridge
and
gave
all
his
time
to
study
and
to
the
cultivation
of
his
mind
the
first
of
his
poems
to
appear
in
print
was
the
ode
on
a
distant
prospect
of
eton
college
published
in
his
elegy
written
in
a
country
churchyard
was
not
published
until
although
it
had
been
written
and
handed
about
in
manuscript
several
years
before
the
post
of
was
offered
him
in
on
the
death
of
colley
cibber
but
he
did
not
accept
it
in
he
was
appointed
professor
of
modern
history
at
cambridge
but
the
state
of
his
health
was
such
that
he
was
never
permitted
to
lecture
he
died
july
at
the
age
of
he
was
certainly
the
most
accomplished
man
of
his
time
says
hales
and
was
something
much
more
than
accomplished
his
learning
was
not
only
wide
but
deep
his
taste
if
perhaps
too
fastidious
was
pure
and
thorough
his
genius
was
of
no
mean
degree
or
order
his
affections
were
of
the
truest
and
his
poems
are
works
of
refinement
rather
than
of
passion
but
yet
they
are
inspired
with
genuine
sentiment
they
are
no
doubt
extremely
artificial
in
form
the
weight
of
their
author
reading
somewhat
depresses
their
originality
he
can
with
difficulty
escape
from
his
books
to
himself
but
yet
there
is
in
him
a
genuine
poetical
spirit
his
poetry
however
elaborated
is
sincere
and
truthful
if
the
exterior
is
what
horace
might
have
called
and
polished
the
thought
is
mostly
of
the
simplest
and
naturalest
matthew
arnold
says
gray
production
was
scanty
and
scanty
it
could
not
but
be
even
what
he
produced
was
not
always
pure
in
diction
true
in
evolution
still
with
whatever
drawbacks
he
is
alone
or
almost
alone
in
his
age
gray
said
himself
that
the
style
he
aimed
at
was
conciseness
of
expression
yet
pure
perspicuous
and
musical
compared
not
with
the
work
of
the
great
masters
of
the
golden
ages
of
poetry
but
with
the
poetry
of
his
own
contemporaries
in
general
gray
may
be
said
to
have
reached
in
his
style
the
excellence
at
which
he
aimed
cowper
writes
i
have
been
reading
gray
works
and
think
him
the
only
poet
since
shakespeare
entitled
to
the
character
of
sublime
lowell
says
gray
if
we
may
believe
the
commentators
has
not
an
idea
scarcely
an
epithet
that
he
can
call
his
own
and
yet
he
is
in
the
best
sense
one
of
the
classics
of
english
literature
and
sir
james
mackintosh
says
of
all
english
poets
he
was
the
most
finished
artist
he
attained
the
highest
degree
of
splendor
of
which
poetic
style
seemed
to
be
capable
it
may
be
added
that
he
deserves
the
comparatively
trifling
praise
of
having
been
the
most
learned
poet

essay
on
criticism
was
published
in
it
consists
of
lines
and
is
written
in
heroic
couplets
that
style
of
poetic
composition
in
which
pope
excelled
all
others
it
is
full
of
sound
critical
precepts
put
together
with
considerable
art
and
expressed
in
a
manner
which
at
the
time
of
its
production
insured
the
popularity
of
the
poem
and
the
fame
of
its
author
it
was
probably
suggested
by
boileau

which
was
founded
on
horace

poetica
and
it
in
turn
on
aristotle
rules
very
commonly
known
among
the
classical
poets
the
essay
says
de
quincey
is
a
collection
of
independent
maxims
tied
together
into
a
fasciculus
by
the
printer
but
having
no
natural
order
or
logical
dependence
generally
so
vague
as
to
mean
nothing
and
what
is
remarkable
many
of
the
rules
are
violated
by
no
man
so
often
as
by
pope

by
pope
nowhere
so

in
this

there
are
no
fewer
than
twelve
couplets
rhyming
to
it
it
requires
very
little
reading
of
the
french
to
find
the
maxims
which
pope
has
strung
together
in
this
poem
but
he
has
dressed
them
so
neatly
and
turned
them
out
with
such
sparkle
and
point
that
these
truisms
have
acquired
a
weight
not
their
own
and
they
circulate
as
proverbs
among
us
in
virtue
of
their
pithy
form
rather
than
their
truth
they
exemplify

he
took
in

this

johnson
says
in
his
on
cecilia
day
pope
is
generally
confessed
to
have
miscarried
yet
he
has
miscarried
only
as
compared
with
dryden
for
he
has
far
outgone
other
competitors
dryden
plan
is
better
chosen
history
will
always
take
stronger
hold
of
the
passions
than
fable
the
passions
excited
by
dryden
are
the
pleasures
and
pains
of
real
life
the
scene
of
pope
is
laid
in
imaginary
existence
pope
is
read
with
calm
acquiescence
dryden
with
turbulent
delight
pope
hangs
upon
the
ear
dryden
finds
the
passes
of
the
mind
both
the
odes
want
the
essential
constituent
of
metrical
compositions
the
stated
recurrence
of
settled
if
pope
ode
be
particularly
inspected
it
will
be
found
that
the
first
stanza
consists
of
sounds
well
chosen
indeed
but
only
sounds
the
second
consists
of
hyperbolical
commonplaces
easily
to
be
found
and
perhaps
without
much
difficulty
to
be
as
well
expressed
in
the
third
however
there
are
numbers
images
harmony
and
vigor
not
unworthy
the
antagonist
of
dryden
had
all
been
like
this
but
every
part
can
not
be
the
best
the
next
stanzas
place
and
detain
us
in
the
dark
and
dismal
regions
of
mythology
we
have
all
that
can
be
performed
by
elegance
of
diction
or
sweetness
of
versification
but
what
can
form
avail
without
better
matter
the
last
stanza
again
refers
to
commonplaces
the
conclusion
is
too
evidently
modelled
by
that
of
dryden
and
it
may
be
remarked
that
both
end
with
the
same
fault
the
comparison
of
each
is
literal
on
one
side
and
metaphorical
on
the
other
poets
do
not
always
express
their
own
thoughts
pope
with
all
this
labor
in
the
praise
of
music
was
ignorant
of
its
principles
and
insensible
of
its

alexander
pope
was
born
in
london
in
he
had
some
instruction
at
home
and
was
afterwards
sent
first
to
a
roman
catholic
seminary
near
winchester
then
to
another
in
london
this
he
said
was
all
the
teaching
i
ever
had
and
god
knows
it
extended
a
very
little
way
when
i
had
done
with
my
priests
i
took
to
reading
by
myself
for
which
i
had
a
very
great
eagerness
and
enthusiasm
especially
for
poetry
and
in
a
few
years
i
had
dipped
into
a
very
great
number
of
the
english
italian
latin
and
greek
poets
he
was
small
of
stature
and
deformed
and
his
ill
health
made
him
peevish
irritable
and
selfish
yet
his
rare
intellectual
abilities
and
the
deserved
success
of
his
earlier
poetry
secured
for
him
the
friendship
of
many
of
the
most
influential
men
of
the
time
bolingbroke
declared
that
he
never
knew
a
man
more
tenderly
devoted
to
his
friends
and
warburton
said
he
is
as
good
a
companion
as
poet
and
what
is
more
appears
to
be
a
good

i

my

friends
made
me
promise
to
write
them
an

for

i
was
so
struck
with
the
subject
which
occurred
to
me
that
i
could
not
leave
it
till
i
had
completed
it
here
it
is
finished
at

a

again
presented
at

taine
says
his

is
an
admirable
in

metre
and

impress
upon

the
emotions

a

of
art
which
victor

alone
has
come
up
to
as

to
be
set

this
anecdote
immortalized
as
it
has
been
by

appears
to
rest
on
the
sole
authority
of
cleitarchus
one
of
the
least
trustworthy
of
the
historians
of
alexander
and
is
in

a

fable

when

different

suidas

timotheus

to
have
played

quintus
curtius
gives
a
minute
description
of
the
burning
of
the
palace
at
persepolis
when
alexander
was
accompanied
by
thais

it
does
not
appear
in
the
accurate
arrian

thais
had
any
share
in
this
transaction

but
more
so
aristobulus
endeavored
to
exculpate
alexander
from
the
charge
of
frequent
ebriety

plainly
mentions
the
drunkenness
of
alexander
as
proverbial

eumenides
or
avengers
of

are
variously
represented

formerly
used

designate
any

way
see
note
above
neither

what
the

is
that
as
helen

the

of
the
destruction
of

so
thais
instigated
the

the

originally
denoted

a

hence
the

the

of
its
numbers
the
force
beauty
and
distinctness
of
its
images
the
succession
of
so
many
different
passions
and
feelings
and
the
matchless
perspicuity
of
its
diction
no
particle
of
it
can
be
wished
away

the
epigrammatic
turn
of
the
four
concluding
lines
hallam
says
this
ode
has
a
few
lines
mingled
with
a
far
greater
number
ill
conceived
and
ill
expressed
the
whole
composition
has
that
spirit
which
dryden
hardly
ever
wanted
but
it
is
too
faulty
for
high
praise
it
used
to
pass
for
the
best
work
of
dryden
and
the
best
ode
in
the
language
but
few
lines
are
highly
poetical
and
some
sink
to
the
level
of
a
common
drinking
song

the
fire
of

from
annus

such
was
the
rise
of
this
prodigious
fire
which
in
mean
buildings
first
obscurely
bred
from
thence
did
soon
to
open
streets
aspire
and
straight
to
palaces
and
temples
spread
the
diligence
of
trades
and
noiseful
gain
and
luxury
more
late
asleep
were
laid
all
was
the
night
and
in
her
silent
reign
no
sound
the
rest
of
nature
did
invade
in
this
deep
quiet
from
what
source
unknown
those
seeds
of
fire
their
fatal
birth
disclose
and
first
few
scattering
sparks
about
were
blown
big
with
the
flames
that
to
our
ruin
rose
then
in
some
room
it
crept
along
and
smouldering
as
it
went
in
silence
fed
till
the
infant
monster
with
devouring
strong
walk
boldly
upright
with
exalted
head
now
like
some
rich
or
mighty
murderer
too
great
for

he
breaks

fresher
for
new
mischiefs
does
appear
and
dares
the
world
to
tax
him
with
the
old
so
scapes
the
insulting
fire
his
narrow
jail
and
makes
small
outlets
into
open
air
there
the
fierce
winds
his
tender
force
assail
and
beat
him
downward
to
his
first
repair
the
winds
like
crafty
courtesans
withheld
his
flames
from
burning
but
to
blow
them
more
and
every
fresh
attempt
he
is
with
faint
denials
weaker
than
before
and
now
no
longer
letted
of
his
prey
he
leaps
up
at
it
with
enraged
desire

with
a
wide
survey

rejoice
about
the
fire

a
dance

bend
and
sing
their
sabbath
notes
with
feeble
voice

guardian
angel
saw
them

they
sate

notes
this
selection
from
dryden
long
and
very
tedious
poem
annus
mirabilis
the
year
of
wonders
is
given
here
as
a
specimen
of
that
kind
of
mechanical
versification
so
popular
in
the
latter
half
of
the
seventeenth
century
that
part
of
my
poem
which
describes
the
fire
says
dryden
i
owe
first
to
the
piety
and
fatherly
affection
of
our
monarch
to
his
suffering
subjects
and
in
the
second
place
to
the
courage
loyalty
and
magnanimity
of
the
city
both
of
which
were
so
conspicuous
that
i
have
wanted
words
to
celebrate
them
as
they
deserve
and
i
have
chosen
to
write
my
poem
in
quatrains
or
stanzas
of
four
in
alternate
rhyme
because
i
have
ever
judged
them
more
noble
and
of
greater
dignity
both
for
the
sound
and
number
than
any
other
verse
in
use
amongst
us
this
opinion
however
was
certainly
not
long
maintained
by
the
poet
for
he
never
afterward
practised
that
form
of
versification
which
he
has
here
praised
prodigious
a
half
sheet
published
immediately
after
the
great
fire
contains
this
account
of
the
catastrophe
which
dryden
describes
in
his
verses
on
sunday
the
second
of
september
this
present
year
about
one
in
the
morning
there
happened
a
sad
and
deplorable
fire
in
near
which
falling
out
in
a
part
of
the
city
so
close
built
with
wooden
houses
in
a
short
time
became
too
big
to
be
mastered
by
any
engines
or
working
near
it
continued
all
monday
and
tuesday
with
such
impetuosity
that
it
consumed
houses
and
churches
all
the
way
to
dunstan
in
at
which
time
by
the
favour
of
god
the
wind
slackened
and
that
night
by
the
vigilancy
industry
and
indefatigable
pains
of
his
majesty
and
his
royal
highness
calling
upon
all
people
and
encouraging
them
by
their
personal
assistances
a
stop
was
put
to
the
fire

at
the
age
of
he
went
up
to
london
with
the
intention
of
devoting
himself
to
literature
and
politics
during
the
brief
remaining
years
of
the
commonwealth
he
was
nominally
a
friend
to
the
puritan
party
and
one
of
the
first
poems
written
by
him
was
a
series
of
heroic
stanzas
on
the
death
of
oliver
cromwell
at
the
restoration
he
at
once
espoused
the
cause
of
the
royalists
and
his
recent
panegyric
on
the
protector
did
not
prevent
him
from
writing
a
poem
astræa
redux
in
honor
of
the
return
of
charles
the
second
in
he
married
the
lady
elizabeth
howard
a
daughter
of
the
earl
of
berkshire
a
royalist
nobleman
for
several
years
he
devoted
himself
chiefly
to
the
writing
of
plays
comedies
tragedies
and
the
comedies
he
wrote
in
prose
the
earliest
tragedies
in
blank
verse
followed
by
several
in
rhyme
and
after
these
others
in
blank
verse
in
he
was
appointed
in
when
nearly
fifty
years
old
by
the
publication
of
absalom
and
achitophel
he
suddenly
became
famous
as
a
satirical
poet
he
soon
afterwards
wrote
the
medal
another
satire
directed
against
the
earl
of
shaftesbury
and
mac
flecknoe
aimed
at
shadwell
the
chief
poet
of
the
opposition
at
about
the
same
time
he
produced
religio
laici
a
didactic
poem
explaining
his
religious
opinions
and
defending
the
church
of
england
against
dissenters
atheists
and
catholics
not
long
after
the
accession
of
james
dryden
true
to
his
policy
of
being
always
on
the
side
of
the
ruling
party
became
a
catholic
and
wrote
the
hind
and
the
panther
in
which
he
eulogized
many
things
that
in
the
former
poem
he
had
ridiculed
his
political
career
ended
with
the
overthrow
of
james
in
but
his
literary
activity
continued
unabated
the
last
years
of
his
life
were
occupied
in
translating
the
works
of
persius
and
juvenal
and
the
æneid
of
virgil
in
he
wrote
alexander
feast
and
his
modernizations
of
some
of
chaucer
poems
appeared
in
the
year
of
his
death
if
there
is
grandeur
in
the
pomp
of
kings
and

of
hosts
says
ward
in
the
loud
clangor
and
in
tapestries
and
carpetings
of
velvet
and
gold
dryden
is
to
be
ranked
with
the
grandest
of
english
poets
the
irresistible
impetus
of
an
invective
which
never
falls
short
or
flat
and
the
savor
of
a
satire
which
never
seems
dull
or
stale
give
him
an
undisputed
place
among
the
most
glorious
of
english
wits
his
descriptive
power
was
of
the
highest
says
hales
our
literature
has
in
it
no
more
vigorous
than
that
he
has
bequeathed
it
his
power
of
expression
is
beyond
praise
there
is
always
a
singular
in
his
language
he
uses
always
the
right
word
he
is
one
of
our
greatest
masters
of
metre
metre
was
in
fact
no
restraint
to
him
but
rather
it
seems
to
have
given
him
freedom
it
has
been
observed
that
he
argues
better
in
verse
than
in
prose
verse
was
the
natural
costume
of
his
thoughts
professor
masson
says
not
only
is
dryden
the
largest
figure
in
one
era
of
our
literature
he
is
a
very
considerable
figure
also
in
our
literature
as
a
whole
of
all
that
he
wrote
however
there
is
but
a
comparatively
small
portion
that
has
won
for
itself
a

was
still
an
undergraduate
at

college
cambridge
from
certain
fragments
and
other
evidence
it
is
believed
that
he
contemplated
writing
a
series
of
poems
on
great
christian
events
in
a
similar
way
this
is
the
first
poem
of
importance

he
wrote

it

an
allusion
to
the
music
of

see
note
above
the
theory
of
pythagoras
was
that
the
distances
between
the
heavenly
bodies
were
determined
by
the
laws
of
musical
concord
these
orbs
in
their
motion
could
not
but
produce
a
certain
sound
or
note
depending
upon
their
distances
and
velocities
and
as
these
were
regulated
by
harmonic
laws
they
necessarily
formed
as
a
whole
a
complete
musical
scale
in
the
whorl
of
the
distaff
of

there
are
eight
concentric
whorls
these
whorls
represent
respectively
the
sun

the
five
planets
and
the
fixed
stars
on
each
whorl
sits
a
siren
singing
their
eight
tones
make
one
exquisite
harmony
milton
added
a
ninth
whorl
that
swift
nocturnal
and
diurnal
rhomb

then
spoke
of

harmony

street
cheapside
london
in
the
year
eight
years

showed
the
possession
of
more
than
ordinary
powers
of
mind
he
was
educated
first
under
private
tutors
and
at
paul
school
and
finally
at
christ
college
cambridge
where
in
he
received
the
degree
of
master
of

his
first
considerable
work
was
the
hymn
on
the
morning
of
the
nativity
written
in
within
the
next
seven
years
he
wrote
the
most
noteworthy
of
his
shorter
poems
the
masque
comus
the
pastoral
piece
entitled
arcades
the
beautiful
descriptive
poems
and
ii

made
a
tour
upon
the
continent
visited
the
famous
seats
of
learning
in
france
and
italy
and
made
the
acquaintance
of
many
of
the
great
poets
and
scholars
of
his
time
upon
hearing
however
that
civil
war
was
about
to
break
out
in
england
he
hastened
home
resolved
to
devote
himself
to
what
he
regarded
as
his
country
best
interests
poetry
was
abandoned
for
politics
and
for
the
next
twenty
years
he
wrote
little
except
prose
political
tracts
and
controversial
essays
when
cromwell
became

milton
was
appointed
latin
secretary
of
state
a
position
which
he
continued
to
hold
until
towards
the
downfall
of
the
commonwealth
but
after
the
restoration
he
quietly
withdrew
into
retirement
resolved
to
devote
the
remainder
of
his
life
to
the
writing
of
the
great
poem
which
he
had
been
contemplating
for
many
years
through
unceasing
study
he
had
lost
his
sight
the
friends
of
his
youth
had
deserted
him
the
fortune
which
he
had
received
from
his
father
was
gone

so
it
was
in
darkness
and
disappointment
and
poverty
that
in
he
gave
to
the

thou
hast
given

a
cell
wherein
to
dwell
a
little
house
whose
humble
roof
is
weather
proof
under
the
spars
of
which
i
lie
both
soft
and
dry
where
thou
my
chamber
for
to
ward
hast
set
a
guard
of
harmless
thoughts
to
watch
and
keep
me
while
i
sleep
low
is
my
porch
as
is
my
fate
both
void
of
state
and
yet
the
threshold
of
my
door
is
worn
by
th
poor
who
thither
come
and
freely
get
good
words
or
meat
like
as
my
parlor
so
my
hall
and
kitchen
small
a
little
buttery
and
therein
a
little
bin
which
keeps
my
little
loaf
of
bread
unchipt
unflead
some
brittle
sticks
of
thorn
or
briar
make
me
a
fire
close
by
whose
living
coal
i
sit
and
glow
like
it
lord
i
confess
too
when
i
dine
the
pulse
is
thine
and
all
those
other
bits
that
be
there
placed
by
thee
the
worts
the
purslain
and
the
mess
of
which
of
thy
kindness
thou
hast
sent
and
my
content
makes
those
and
my
belovèd
beet
to
be
more
sweet
is
thou
that
my
glittering
hearth
with
guiltless
mirth
and
me
wassail
bowls
to
drink
spiced
to
the
brink
lord
is
thy
hand
that
soils
my
land
and
me
for
my
bushel
sown
twice
ten
for
one
thou
my
teeming
hen
to
lay
her
egg
each
day
besides
my
healthful
ewes
to
bear
me
twins
each
year
the
while
the
conduits
of
my
kine
run
cream
for
wine
all
these
and
better
thou
dost
send
me
to
this
end
that
i
should
render
for
my
part
a
thankful
heart
which
fired
with
incense
i
resign
as
wholly
thine
but
the
acceptance
that
must
be
my
christ

thee

he
united
himself
with

and
entered
upon
a
career
not
altogether
creditable
to
his
profession
of
parson
at
the
restoration
of

ii
he
was
returned
to
his
vicarage
where
he

the
most
illustrious
and
most
hopeful
prince
charles

it
contains

after
all
herrick
best
things
says
robert
buchanan
are
his
poems
in
praise
of
the
country
life
and
his
worst
things
are
his
epigrams
his
gladsome
mercurial
temper
had
a
great
deal
to
do
with
the
composition
of
his
best
lyrics
for
the
parson
of
dean
prior
was
no
philosopher
and
his
lightest
airiest
verses
are
the
best
his
was
a
happy
careless
nature
throwing
off
verses
out
of
the
fulness
of
a
joyous
heart
rioting
in
a
pleasant
sunny
element

poets
may
boast
as
safely
vain
their
works
shall
with
the
world
remain
both
bound
together
live
or

the
verses
and
the
prophecy
but
who
can
hope
his
line
should
long
last
in
a
tongue
while
they

as
that

his

can
only
boast
the
glory
of
his
numbers
lost
years
have
his
matchless
strain
and
yet
he
did
not
sing
in
vain
the
beauties
which
adorn
that
age
the
shining
subjects
of
his
rage
hoping
they
should
immortal

all
an
english
pen
can
hope
to
make

so
far
extend

thus

has
no
ill
fate
if
it

but
at
the
date
of

beauty
if

as

which
her

round
biographical
note
edmund
waller
whose
poetry
is
noticeable
because
he
was
the
first
english
versifier
to
adopt
the
french
fashion
of
writing
in
couplets
was
born
in
warwickshire
in
he
was
elected
to
parliament
at
the
age
of
seventeen
and
was
a
member
of
that
body
during
the
greater
part
of
his
life
at
the
beginning
of
the
difficulties
between
the
king
and
the
parliament
he
gained
some
notoriety
by
his
opposition
to
the
former
but
when
the
civil
war
broke
out
he
attached
himself
to
the
royalist
cause
in
being
convicted
of
complicity
in
a
plot
against
parliament
he
was
fined
and
imprisoned
for
twelve
months
after
his
release
he
went
to
france
but
in
he
returned
to
england
and
became
reconciled
to
the
new
government
writing
soon
afterward
a
panegyric
to
my
lord
protector
of
the
present
greatness
and
joint
interest
of
his
highness
and
this
nation
at
the
restoration
he
eagerly
declared
allegiance
to
charles
and
wrote
a
congratulatory
ode
on
that
monarch
return
he
became
a
court
favorite
noted
for
his
wit
was
made
provost
of
eton
and
returned
to
his
old
place
in
parliament
he
died
october
the
first
edition
of
his
poems
was
published
in
and
from
that
time
to
the
close
of
the
seventeenth
century
he
was
quite
generally
regarded
as
the
greatest
of
english
poets
at
the
present
time
there
are
few
writers
so
little
considered
as
he
waller
may
be
regarded
as
the
founder
of
the
classical
school
of
english
poetry
in
which
dryden
and
pope
excelled
and
which
remained
in
the
ascendency
for
more
than
a
century
after
his
death
the
excellence
and
dignity
of
rhyme
says
dryden
were
never
fully
known
till
waller
taught
it
he
first
made
writing
easily
an
art
first
showed
us
to
conclude
the
sense
most
commonly
in
distichs
which
in
the
verse
of
those
before
him
runs
on
for
so
many
lines
together
that
the
reader
is
out
of
breath
to
overtake
it
and
johnson
says
he
certainly
very
much
excelled
in
smoothness
most
of
the
writers
who
were
living
when
his
poetry
commenced
but
he
was
rather
smooth
than
strong
of
the
resounding
line
which
pope
attributes
to
dryden
he
has
given
very
few
examples
the
general
character
of
his
poetry
is
elegance
and
gaiety
he
seems
neither
to
have
had
a
mind
much
elevated
by
nature
nor
amplified
by
learning
his
thoughts
are
such
as
a
liberal
conversation
and
large
acquaintance
with
life
would
easily
supply
ben
jonson
an
ode
to
himself
where
dost
thou
careless
lie
buried
in
ease
and
sloth
knowledge
that
sleeps
doth
die
and
this
security
it
is
the
common
moth
that
eats
on
wits
and
arts
and
so
destroys
them
both
are
all
the
aonian
springs

up

that
not
a
nymph
now
sings
or
droop
they
as
disgrac
to
see
their
seats
and
bowers
by
chattering
pies
defac
if
hence
thy
silence
be
as
is
too
just
a
cause
let
this
thought
quicken
thee
minds
that
are
great
and
free
should
not
on
fortune
pause
is
crown
enough
to
virtue
still
her
own
applause
what
though
the
greedy
fry
be
taken
with
false
baits
of
worded
balladry
and
think
it
poesy
they
die
with
their
conceits
and
only
piteous
scorn
upon
their
folly
waits
then
take
in
hand
thy
lyre
strike
in
thy
proper
strain
with
japhet
line
aspire
sol
chariot
for
new

to
give
the
world
again
who
aided

will
thee
the

since
our
dainty
age
can
not
endure
reproof
make
not

to
be
such
as
neither

can
praise
too
much

suffrage
but
these

i
meant
unto
thy
praise
for

ignorance
on

may
light
which
when
it
sounds
at
best
but
echoes
right
or
blind
affection
which
doth
advance
the
truth
but
gropes
and
urgeth
all
by
chance
or
crafty
malice
might
pretend
this
praise
and
think
to
ruin
where
it
seemed
to
praise
but
thou
art
proof
against
them
and
indeed
above
the
ill
fortune
of
them

the
need
i
therefore
will
begin

applause

of

rise
i
will
not
lodge
thee
by
chaucer

or
bid
beaumont
lie
a
little
further
to
make
thee
a
room
thou
art
a
monument
without
a
tomb
and
art
alive
still
while
thy
book
doth
live
and
we
have
wits
to
read
and
praise
to
give
that
i
not
mix
thee
so
my
brain
excuses
i
mean
with
great
but
disproportioned
muses
for
if
i
thought
my
judgment
were
of
years
i
should
commit
thee
surely
with
thy
peers
and
tell
how
far
thou
didst
our
lyly
outshine
or

mighty
line

not

age

for

time
and
all
the
muses
still
were
in
their
prime
when
like
apollo
he
came
forth
to
warm
our
ears
or
like
a
mercury
to
charm
nature
herself
was
proud
of
his
designs
and
joyed
to
wear
the
dressing
of
his
lines
which
were
so
richly
spun

my
gentle
shakespeare
must
enjoy
a

that
he
who

a
keen
sense
and
remembrance
of
the
disappointments
which
had
followed
him
through
life

to
these
he
touchingly
refers
in
the
prologue
he
that
hath
feasted
you
these
forty
years
and
fitted
fables
for
your
finer
ears

at

scarce
could

the
bore

you
with
patience
hearkening

and
more
at

have
grown
up
to
him
and
made
known
the
working
of

you
would
vouchsafe
for
your
own
sake
to
hear
him
this
once
more
but
sit
awake

though
he
now

you
with

as

have

pedantrie
awkwardnesses
we
meet
with
brilliant
pictures
and

how
happens
it
that
when
this
generation
was
exhausted
true
poetry
ended
in
england
as
true
painting
in
italy
and
flanders
it
was
because
an
epoch
of
the
mind
came
and
passed
away
that
namely
of
instinctive
and
creative
conception
these
men
had
new
senses
and
no
theories
in
their
they
are
happy
in
contemplating
beautiful
things
and
wish
only
that
they
should
be
the
most
beautiful
possible
they
do
not
excite
themselves
to
express
moral
or
philosophical
ideas
they
wish
to
enjoy
through
the
imagination
through
the
eyes
like
those
italian
nobles
who
at
the
same
time
were
so
captivated
by
fine
colors
and
forms
that
they
covered
with
paintings
not
only
their
rooms
and
their
churches
but
the
lids
of
their
chests
and
the
saddles
of
their
think
what
poetry
was
likely
to
spring
from
them
how
superior
to
common
events
how
free
from
literal
imitation
how

how

cry

they
have
singled
with
much
ado
the
cold
fault
cleanly
out

do
they

as

by
this
poor
wat

hearken

foes
pursue

biographical
note
william
shakespeare
was
born
at
in
april
and
died
there
april
his
fame
rests
chiefly
upon
his
dramatic
compositions
his
two
narrative
poems
venus
and
adonis
and
the
rape
of
lucrece
were
published
in
and
before
any
of
his
plays
had
been
printed
they
may
be
regarded
as
companion
pieces
written
in
the
same
style
and
distinguished
by
similar
characteristics
a
couple
of
says
dowden
these
two
poems
of
shakespeare
have
been
called
by
hazlitt
are
he
says
hard
as
glittering
as
cold
cold
indeed
they
will
seem
to
any
one
who
listens
to
hear
in
them
the
natural
cry
of
human
passion
but
the
paradox
is
true
that
for
a
young
poet
of
elizabeth
age
to
be
natural
direct
simple
would
have
been
indeed
unnatural
he
was
most
happy
when
most
fantastical
he
spun
a
shining
web
to
catch
conceits
inevitably
as
a
spider
casts
his
thread
the
wit
was
itself
warm
while
erecting
its
coleridge
says
of
the
venus
and
adonis
that
its
most
obvious
excellence
is
the
perfect
sweetness
of
the
versification
its
adaptation
to
the
subject
and
the
power
displayed
in
varying
the
march
of
the
words
without
passing
into
a
loftier
and
more
majestic
rhythm
than
was
demanded
by
the
thoughts
or
permitted
by
the
propriety
of
preserving
a
sense
of
melody
predominant
shakespeare
sonnets
were
published
in
concerning
the
origin
purpose
and
interpretation
of
these
poems
many
widely
different
theories
have
been
proposed
some
have
looked
on
them
as
one
poem
says
fleay
some
as
several
poems
of
groups
of
sonnets
some
as
containing
a
separate
poem
in
each
sonnet
they
have
been
supposed
to
be
written
in
shakespeare
own
person
or
in
the
character
of
another
or
of
several
others
to
be
autobiographical
or
heterobiographical
or
allegorical
to
have
been
addressed
to
lord
southampton
to
sir
william
herbert
to
his
own
wife
to
lady
rich
to
his
child
to
himself
to
his
muse
the
safest
and
wisest
course
seems
to
be
first
to
regard
each
of
the
one
hundred
and
sonnets
as
a
poem
complete
in
itself
and
after
studying
whatever
it
may
contain
of
art

notes
this
is
a
selection
from
spenser
great
poem
the
faerie
queene
being
a
part
of
the
seventh
canto
of
book
second
the
faerie
queene
was
published
in
and
comprises
six
books
of
twelve
cantos
each
the
first
book
is
the
legend
of
the
red
cross
knight
or
holiness
the
second
of
sir
guyon
or
temperance
the
third
of
britomartis
or
chastity
the
fourth
of
cambel
and
triamond
or
friendship
the
fifth
of
artegall
or
justice
the
sixth
of
sir
calidore
or
courtesy
it
was
spenser
design
that
the
complete
work
should
contain
twelve
books
but
of
the
remaining
part
only
a
fragment
of
one
book
the
legend
of
constance
is
in
existence
the
versification
of
the
faerie
queene
is
based
upon
the
made
so
popular
in
italian
poetry
by
tasso
and
ariosto
instead
of
eight
lines
to
a
stanza
however
there
are
nine
the
first
eight
lines
are
iambic
pentameters
and
the
ninth
a
hexameter
the
stanza
thus
closing
with
a
lingering
cadence
which
adds
greatly
to
the
melody
of
the
verse
this
is
the
spenserian
stanza
a
form
of
versification
very
popular
with
many
of
our
later
poets
if
you
love
poetry
well
enough
to
enjoy
it
for
its
own
sake
says
leigh
hunt
let
no
evil
reports
of
his
deter
you
from
an
acquaintance
with
spenser
for
great
will
be
your
loss
his
allegory
itself
is
but
one
part
allegory
and
nine
parts
beauty
and
enjoyment
sometimes
an
excess
of
flesh
and
blood
his
wholesale
poetical
belief
mixing
up
all
creeds
and
mythologies
but
with
less
violence
resembles
that
of
dante
and
boccaccio
his
versification
is
almost
perpetual
honey
dell
from
delve
to
dig
each
canto
of
the
faerie
queene
is
introduced
by
a
doggerel
like
this
containing
the
argument
or
a
brief
summary
of
the
narrative
in
imitation
probably
of
ariosto
orlando
furioso
sordid
miserly
probably
from
to
become
mouldy
or
musty
the
word
may
be
traced
to
a
similar
root
the

the
northerne

in
the
summer
of

married
a

he
resumed

upon

but
it
was
rudely
interrupted
by
the
breaking
out
of
an
insurrection
among
the
irish
in
spenser
house
was
sacked
and
burned
by
the
rebels
and
it
was
with
the
greatest
difficulty
that
he
and
his
family
escaped
with
their
lives
indeed
it
is
stated
on
the
authority
of
ben
jonson
that
one
little
child
perished
in
the
flames
spenser
returned
to
london
in
poverty
and
great
distress
and
on
the
of
january
he
died
in

been
very
appropriately
named

had

drayton
browne
drummond

were
as
full
of
him
as
the

were
of
shakespeare
milton
studied
and
used
him
calling
him
and
serious
spenser
and
adding
that
he
be
known
to
think
him
a
better
teacher
than
scotus
and
aquinas
cowley
said
he
became
a

him
dryden

imitated

hazlitt
says
of
all
the
poets
spenser
is
the
most
poetical
and
taine
declares
that
no
modern
is
more
like
homer
than
he
with
reference
to
the
peculiar
forms
of
language
comparatively
obsolete
even
when
the
faerie
queene
was
composed
which
are
so
marked
a
characteristic
of
spenser
poetry
hales
says
the
subject
he
chose
for
his
great
work
drew
him
into
the
midst
of
the
old
times
of
chivalry
and
the
literature
that
belonged
to
them
with
such
a
subject
the
older
forms
of
the
language
seemed
to
consort
better
to
him
too
perhaps
as
to
virgil
the
older
words
and
seemed
to
give
elevation
and
dignity
moreover
an
older
dialect
was
probably
to
some
extent
his
vernacular
as
he
had
probably
passed
his
youth
in
lancashire
lastly
the
only
great
poet
who
had
preceded
him
his
great
model
the
tityrus
of
whom
he

a

and
was
probably
at

a

of

which
was
sent
to
bring
the
maid
of
norway
to
scotland

the

many
changes
and
additions
some
of
which

with

robin

that

is
to

the
slack

set
it
in
the
glen
they
hanged
the
proud
sherìff
on

released
their
own
three
men
notes
among
the
earliest
and
most
popular
of
english
ballads
are
those
relating
to
robin
hood
this
noted
outlaw
was
the
impersonation
of
popular
rights
as
they
were
understood
by
englishmen
of
the
lower
orders
in
the
days
of
the
plantagenets
hence
the
memory
of
him
and
his
reputed
deeds
was
preserved
in
the
songs
of
the
people
it
is
he
says
an
old
historian
whom
the
common
people
love
so
dearly
to
celebrate
in
games
and
comedies
and
whose
history
sung
by
fiddlers
interests
them
more
than
any
other
even
so
late
as
the
reign
of
edward
robyn
hoode
daye
was
very
generally
observed
in
the
country
parishes
as
a
day
of
feasting
and
amusement
the
ballads
were
originally
the
production
of
wandering
minstrels
or
gleemen
a
class
of
men
very
popular
in
the
middle
ages
who
followed
the
profession
of
poetry
and
music
these
rude
poets
were
held
in
the
highest
esteem
and
veneration
by
the
people
among
whom
they
lived
they
were
received
and
welcomed
wherever
they
went
and
even
kings
delighted
to
honor
them
in
short
their
art
was
supposed
by
the
to
be
of
divine
origin
having
been
invented
by
odin
the
great
and
perfected
by
bragi
the
musician
of
the
gods
as
however
civilization
advanced
and
christianity
became
established
this
admiration
for
the
minstrel
and
his
art
became
modified
in
a
degree
he
was
no
longer
regarded
as
a
poet
but
only
as
a
singer
a
sweet
musician
poetry
was
cultivated
by
men
of
leisure
and
refinement
but
lyrical
ballads
remained
the
peculiar
inheritance
of
the
minstrel
for
a
long
time
after
the
norman
conquest
minstrels
continued
to
gain
their
livelihood
by
singing
in
the
houses
of
the
great
and
at
festive
occasions
which
were
never
considered
complete
unless
graced
by
the
presence
of
these
honored
descendants
of
bragi
nor
did
they
cease
to
compose
and
sing
their
inimitable
pieces
until
near
the
close
of
elizabeth
reign
the
greater
number
of
the
ballads
now
in
existence
were
probably
produced
during
the
fifteenth
and
sixteenth
centuries
and
the
best
of
them
originated
in
the
north
country
or
the
border
region
between
england
and
scotland
they
were
not
at
first
reduced
to
writing
but
were
handed
down
from
one
generation
to
another
merely
by
oral
tradition
as
regards
their
metre
and
versification
the
ballads
were
commonly
composed
of
iambic
hexameters
or
heptameters
rhyming
in
couplets
these
couplets
are
readily
broken
into
stanzas
of
four
lines
in
which
form
they
are
usually
printed
the
first
collection
of
english
ballads
ever
published
was
probably
that
of
john
dryden
in
the
collection
was
included
in
a
volume
entitled
in
a
work
called
collection
of
old
was
published
anonymously
in
allan
ramsay
issued
being
a
collection
of
scots
poems
wrote
by
the
ingenious
before
this
work
included
many
popular
songs
and
ballads
it
was
reprinted
in
we
owe
the
preservation
of
a
large
number
of
the
most
interesting
and
beautiful
ballads
to
bishop
percy
who
in
published
the
first
really
valuable
collection
of
such
works
in
his
of
ancient
english
previous
to
that
time
most
of
these
songs
had
existed
only
in
manuscript
or
if
printed
at
all
in
the
cheapest
style
of
typography
on
sheets
designed
for
circulation
among
the
poor
bishop
percy
work
first
called
the
attention
of
scholars
to
the
value
and
beauty
of
these
neglected
and
relics
and
did
much
to
bring
about
that
revolution
in
literature
which
took
place
in
the
latter
part
of
the
last
century
and
it
is
to
these
old
ballads
thus
rescued
from
oblivion
that
we
owe
very
many
of
the
noblest
literary
productions
of
the
present
century
we
know
that
they
were
the
immediate
inspiration
of
sir
walter
scott
and
that
they
exerted
a
wonderful
influence
in
modifying
and
directing
the
taste
and
style
of
many
other
distinguished
writers
the
fifteenth
century
we
pass
from
chaucer
age
we
have
to
overleap
nearly
a
hundred
and
eighty
years
before
we
alight
upon
a
period
presenting
anything
like
an
adequate
show
of
literary
continuation
a
few
smaller
names
are
all
that
can
be
cited
as
poetical
representatives
of
this
sterile
interval
in
the
literary
history
of
england
whatever
of
chaucer
genius
still
lingered
in
the
island
seeming
to
have
travelled
northward
and
taken
refuge
in
a
series
of
scotch
poets
excelling
any
of
their
english
contemporaries
we
are
driven
to
suppose
that
there
was
something
in
the
social
circumstances
of
england
during
the
long
period
in
question
which
prevented
such
talent
as
there
was
from
assuming
the
particular
form
of
literature
fully
to
make
out
what
this
was
may
baffle
us
but
when
we
remember
that
this
was
the
period
of
the
civil
wars
of
the
roses
we
have
reason
to
believe
that
the
dearth
of
pure
literature
may
have
been
owing
in
part
to
the
engrossing
nature
of
the
practical
questions
which
then
disturbed
english
accordingly
though
printing
was
introduced
during
this
period
and
thus
englishmen
had
greater
temptations
to
write
what
they
did
write
was
almost
exclusively
plain
grave
prose
intended
for
practical
or
polemical
occasions
and
making
no
figure
in
a
historical
david
masson
we
quote
all
these
good
people
who
have
nothing
to
say
dozens
of
translators
importing
the
poverties
of
french
poetry
rhyming
chroniclers
most
commonplace
of
men
spinners
and
spinsters
of
didactic
poems
who
pile
up
verses
on
the
training
of
falcons
on
heraldry
on
chemistry
invent
the
same
dream
over
again
for
the
hundredth
time
and
get
themselves
taught
universal
history
by
the

biographical
note
john
skelton
was
born
about
the
year
in
his
earlier
life
he
was
the
friend
of
caxton
the
first
english
printer
and
of
percy
earl
of
northumberland
he
was
under
henry
and
tutor
of
the
young
prince
afterwards
henry
viii
and
was
described
by
erasmus
as
anglicarum
lumen
et
later
in
life
he
was
promoted
to
the
rectory
of
diss
in
norfolk
but
was
severely
censured
by
his
bishop
for
his
buffooneries
in
the
pulpit
and
his
satirical
ballads
against
the
mendicants
he
finally
became
a
about
the
court
of
henry
viii
and
daring
to
write
a
rhyming
libel
on
cardinal
wolsey
was
driven
to
take
refuge
in
the
sanctuary
of
westminster
abbey
there
he
was
kindly
entertained
and
protected
by
abbot
islip
until
his
death
in
some
of
his
poems
were
printed
in
and
others
in
taine
calls
skelton
a
virulent
pamphleteer
who
jumbles
together
french
english
latin
phrases
with
slang
and
fashionable
words
invented
words
intermingled
with
short
rhymes

art
of
every
kind
at
an

beneath
the
vain
parade
of

is

rudely
rusty
yf
ye
take
welle
therewithe
it
hath
in
it
some
pithe
as
to
the
coarseness
which
characterizes
his
verses
it
can
not
be
explained
by
saying
that
it
is
a
reflection
of
the
manners
of
the
times
in
which
he
lived
for
as
warton
says
skelton
would
have
been
a
writer
without
decorum
at
any
period
yet
notwithstanding
his
faults
he
is
deserving
of
our
notice
if
for
nothing
else
on
account
of
the
complete
originality
of
his
style
a
style
unknown
and
unattempted
by
any
former
writer
his
bold
departure
from
the
accepted
rules
of
versification
showed
to
those
who
followed
him
some
of
the
possibilities
in
english
poetical
composition
and
helped
to
open
the
way
to

four
poets
of
this
century
john
lydgate
was
born
at
the
village
of
lydgate
near
newmarket
about
he
was
a
benedictine
monk
attached
to
the
monastery
of
bury
edmunds
and
is
remembered
as
the
author
of
three
poems
which
in
their
time
attracted
much
attention
these
are
the
storie
of
thebes
written
in
rhyming
couplets
and
founded
upon
the
teseide
of
boccaccio
the
troye
book
finished
about
and
relating
the
story
of
the
trojan
war
as
recounted
by
guido
di
colonna
in
his
latin
prose
history
of
troy
and
the
falls
of
princes
founded
on
a
french
version
of
boccaccio
de
casibus
virorum
illustrium
in
lydgate
wrote
a
wearisome
but
somewhat
amusing
poem
pur
le
roy
describing
a
visit
to
london
and
the
pageants
processions
and
other
rejoicings
on
the
occasion
of
the
entrance
of
henry
vi
into
the
city
after
his
coronation
the
date
of
the
poet
death
is
not
exactly
known
but
it
was
probably
not
later
than
robert
henryson
an
accomplished
man
and
a
good
and
genuine
poet
was
born
about
the
year
and
died
near
the
close
of
the
century
he
was
for
a
time
a
schoolmaster
and
notary
public
at
dunfermline
in
scotland
and
was
connected
in
some
capacity
with
the
university
of
glasgow
he
was
probably
like
lydgate
a
benedictine
monk
his
principal
works
are
the
testament
of
cresseid
a
sequel
to
chaucer
troilus
and
cresseide
and
a
collection
of
thirteen
fables
he
wrote
also
many
shorter
poems
of
which
the
ballad
of
robin
and
makyne
published
in
percy
is
the
best
known
william
dunbar
was
born
in
east
lothian
scotland
about
the
year
he
was
educated
at
the
university
of
andrews
and
in
early
life
travelled
somewhat
extensively
as
a
novitiate
of
the
order
of
francis
he
visited
england
in
upon
the
occasion
of
the
marriage
of
james
iv
of
scotland
to
the
princess
margaret
daughter
of
henry
vii
one
of
his
best
poems
the
thistle
and
the
rose
was
written
in
commemoration
of
that
event
he
accompanied
the
queen
to
aberdeen
in
and
for
some
time
both
before
and
after
was
in
attendance
and
favor
at
the
scotch
court
nothing
is
known
of
his
death
but
it
has
been
conjectured
that
he
fell
in
the
battle
of
flodden
in
besides
the
poem
just
mentioned
he
wrote
the
golden
targe
the
dance
of
the
deadly
sins
and
many
shorter
poems
most
of
which
are
allegories
the
thistle
and
the
rose
has
been
pronounced
the
happiest
political
allegory
in
our
language
heraldry
has
never
been
more
skilfully
handled
nor
compliments
more
gracefully
paid
nor
fidelity
more
persuasively
preached
to
a
monarch
than
in
this
poem
gawain
douglas
was
a
son
of
the
famous
earl
of
angus
and
was
born
in
brechin
scotland
about
he
was
educated
partly
at
the
university
of
andrews
and
partly
in
paris
his
first
considerable
poem
the
palice
of
honour
was
published
in
and
dedicated
to
king
james
iv
it
is
an
allegory
such
as
was
at
that
time
the
staple
of
poetical
composition
and
contains
but
little
that
is
particularly
original
another
allegory
printed
after
his
death
is
entitled
king
hart
and
has
for
its
subject
the
heart
of
man
his
greatest
work
is
his
translation
of
virgil
æneid
into
scottish
verse
in
douglas
was
appointed
provost
of
giles
edinburgh
and
after
the
battle
of
flodden
he
was
made
abbot
of
aberbrothwick
in
he
was
consecrated
bishop
of
dunkeld
but
was
unable
to
gain
possession
of
the
cathedral
except
by
force
becoming
involved
in
the
feud
between
the
rival
families
of
angus
and
hamilton
he
was
obliged
to
escape
into
england
in
where
towards
the
end
of
the
same
year
he
died
the
fourteenth
century
the
fourteenth
century
there
comes
an
englishman
nourished
on
this
the
romance
poetry
taught
his
trade
by
this
poetry
getting
words
rhyme
metre
from
this
poetry
for
even
of
that
stanza
which
the
italians
used
and
which
chaucer
derived
immediately
from
the
italians
the
basis
and
suggestion
was
probably
given
in
if
we
ask
ourselves
wherein
consists
the
immense
superiority
of
chaucer
poetry
over
the
earlier
why
it
is
that
in
passing
from
this
to
chaucer
we
suddenly
feel
ourselves
to
be
in
another
world
we
shall
find
that
his
superiority
is
both
in
the
substance
of
his
poetry
and
in
the
style
of
his
poetry
his
superiority
in
substance
is
given
by
his
large
free
simple
clear
yet
kindly
view
of
human
we
have
only
to
call
to
mind
the
prologue
to
canterbury
tales
the
right
comment
upon
it
is
dryden
is
sufficient
to
say
according
to
the
proverb
that
is
god
and
again
is
a
perpetual
fountain
of
good
sense
it
is
by
a
large
free
sound
representation
of
things
that
poetry
this
high
criticism
of
life
has
truth
of
substance
and
chaucer
poetry
has
truth
of
substance
if
we
think
of
chaucer
divine
liquidness
of
diction
his
divine
fluidity
of
movement
it
is
difficult
to
speak
temperately
they
are
irresistible
and
justify
all
the
rapture
with
which
his
successors
speak
of
his
gold
of
chaucer
is
the
father
of
our
splendid
english
poetry
he
is
our
of
english
undefiled
because
by
the
lovely
charm
of
his
diction
the
lovely
charm
of
his
movement
he
makes
an
epoch
and
founds
a
tradition
in
spenser
shakespeare
milton
keats
we
can
follow
the
tradition
of
the
liquid
diction
the
fluid
movement
of
chaucer
at
one
time
it
is
his
liquid
diction
of
which
in
these
poets
we
feel
the
virtue
and
at
another
it
is
his
fluid
movement
and
the
virtue
is

has
undergone
this
saying

true
it
ought
to
be
not
only
possible
but
easy
for
an
educated
reader
to
learn
the
few
essentials
of
chaucerian
grammar
and
for
an
ear
at
all
trained
to
poetry
to
tune
itself
to
the
unfamiliar
harmonies
for
those
who
make
the
attempt
the
reward
is
certain
they
will
gain
the
knowledge
not
only
of
the
great
poet
and
creative
genius

of
the
master
who
uses
our
language

a
power
a
freedom
a
variety
a
rhythmic
beauty
that
in
five
centuries
not
ten
of
his
successors
have
been
found
able
to
the
peculiarities
of
diction
and
grammar
which
distinguish
poetry
seem
to
make
its
reading
and
comprehension
difficult
and
often
discourage
the
student
at
the
outset
a
very
little
study
however
will
show
that
the
difficulties
in
the
way
are
not
nearly
so
great
as
they
at
first
appear
and
after
a
little
patient
practice
in
reading
they
will
disappear
entirely
by
observing
the
following
rules
you
will
soon
acquire
the
ability
to
read
with
a
fluency
which
will
be
highly
pleasing
to
you
final
should
be
pronounced
as
a
separate
syllable
whenever
the
metre
demands
it
in

words
of
french
origin
such
as
viságe
coráge
maniér
the
final
syllable
is
accented
the
greatest
difficulty
in
reading
chaucer
arises
from
the
antiquated
manner
in
which
the
words
are
spelled
but
if
the
reader
will
change
an
occasional
to
and
drop
a
final
or
a
final
here
and
there
the
words
which
seemed
at
first
so
strange
will
appear
more
familiar
to
the
eye
and
the
understanding

like
a
jeweller
with
his
hands
full
pearls
and
glass
beads
sparkling
diamonds
and
common
agates
black

and
ruby
roses
all
that
history
and
imagination
had
been
able
to
gather
and
fashion
during
three
centuries
in
the
east
in

in

in

in

all
that
had
rolled
his
way
clashed
together
broken
or
polished
by
the
stream
of

jumble
of

holds
in
his
hand
arranges
it
composes
therefrom
a
long
sparkling
ornament
with
twenty
pendants
a
thousand
facets
which
by
its
splendor
variety
contrasts
may
attract
and
satisfy
the
eyes
of
those
most
greedy
for
amusement
and
novelty
