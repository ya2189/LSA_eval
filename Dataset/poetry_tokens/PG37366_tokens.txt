vacation
verse
by
montreal
witness
printing
house
to
robert
mcdougall
my
dear
my
intention
when
i
left
the
country
was
as
you
know
to
publish
a
volume
of
some
size
which
should
present
among
its
contents
the
long
poem
which
i
wrote
during
the
early
part
of
my
last
vacation
the
design
has
dwindled
until
it
finds
its
execution
in
the
publication
of
this
little
pamphlet
containing
merely
passages
from
that
poem
some
of
these
you
heard
recited
as
we
strolled
together
through
the
fields
of
the
chateauguay
valley
and
were
kind
enough
to
approve
my
hope
is
that
considering
the
stage
of
advancement
of
their
author
and
remembering
the
circumstances
of
his
writing
during
the
intervals
of
study
for
a
college
examination
you
will
approve
all
the
pieces
here
presented
to
you
by
him
and
my
further
hope
is
that
you
you
sweet
in
song
as
firm
in
friendship
may
yet
have
cause
to
regard
him
as
one
who
touch
a
jarring
lyre
at
first
but
ever
strove
to
make
it
true
your
sincere
friend
october
a
walk
in
mount
royal
park
canadian
cities
next
morning
in
the
park
i
took
a
stroll
a
walk
upon
mount
royal
is
a
thing
glorious
at
any
time
but
most
of
all
at
early
morning
in
the
opening
spring
while
yet
the
to
the
cling
and
little
streamlets
lash
the
steaming
side
while
on
the
air
the
april
breezes
fling
an
appetizing
vigor
far
and
wide
and
make
the
steep
ascent
a
pleasure
and
a
pride
the
path
ascends
by
stately
ravenscrag
and
past
the
monument
which
marks
his
rest
over
whose
history
strange
traditions
drag
their
spectral
robes
his
memory
sole
behest
here
for
a
moment
halting
all
imprest
with
other
thoughts
than
find
a
ready
tongue
i
view
the
leopard
slope
the
bristling
crest
the
blue
beyond
with
cloud
veils
lightly
hung
and
glory
in
a
dream
of
time
when
earth
was
young
i
follow
by
the
winding
road
until
by
taking
at
the
sweep
the
northern
arm
i
reach
the
summit
for
the
topmost
hill
the
scenery
reserves
her
chiefest
charm
the
upper
sky
is
clear
and
light
and
warm
the
southern
peaks
that
far
away
i
wist
seem
close
upon
me
round
their
lower
form
a
shroud
is
wrapped
their
tops
by
sunlight
kiss
high
in
appear
and
mighty
in
the
mist
beneath
the
river
spreads
his
sheen
spanned
by
not
least
of
master
workmanships
which
sits
as
conscious
daughter
of
a
queen
and
here
art
thou
my
city
and
thou
thy
towers
in
the
mist
whose
magic
strips
my
spirit
of
the
pall
time
weaves
in
vain
nor
time
nor
disappointment
can
eclipse
days
of
young
bliss
they
must
and
will
remain
once
more
a
wonder
thou
half
city
of
the
brain
fair
art
thou
city
of
lawrence
isle
fair
city
of
the
hundred
spires
the
seat
of
the
western
notre
dame
whose
towered
pile
rivals
the
first
of
many
a
stately
street
and
comely
mansion
many
a
garden
sweet
of
art
and
nature
envious
to
please
thou
of
the
mountain
brow
before
whose
feet
the
northern
amazon
his
tribute
fees
fraught
with
the
waters
of
five
mighty
inland
seas
and
fair
art
thou
whilome
the
capital
not
what
thou
wert
but
yet
a
gorgeous
grave
fortress
of
fame
upon
whose
rocky
wall
records
of
glory
awe
the
trembling
wave
heights
where
the
memories
of
heroes
pave
the
ancient
streets
and
lustre
all
the
scene
fair
too
thou
city
where
our
fasces
have
their
present
rest
none
worthier
i
ween
and
fair
ay
very
fair
thou
city
called
queen
study
in
solitude
is
true
in
midst
of
all
there
may
arise
for
man
society
a
sudden
thirst
a
sense
of
hopeless
vacancy
which
dries
the
spirit
with
a
loneliness
accurst
a
longing
irresistible
to
burst
the
branchy
brake
with
other
birds
to
sing
or
as
from
where
in
solemn
shades
immerst
the
beetle
comes
to
wanton
on
the
wing
around
my
lamplight
flame
alas
poor
foolish
thing
but
here
thou
associate
though
alone
with
worthiest
men
the
best
of
every
age
through
whom
the
universe
of
thought
has
grown
to
what
it
is
the
noble
good
and
sage
how
vain
the
fret
how
frivolous
the
rage
for
social
rank
when
thus
monarchs
deign
in
close
communion
gladly
to
engage
nay
more
than
monarchs
still
the
mantuan
swain
his
fadeless
laurel
wears
what
crowned
augustus
reign
a
thing
of
gold
is
crumbled
in
the
dust
the
crowns
of
sovereigns
and
their
sceptres
all
decay
and
are
forgotten
who
would
trust
his
fame
to
what
fleet
ruin
must
inthral
tombs
will
obliterate
and
columns
fall
annals
be
lost
and
nothing
have
remained
of
dynasties
the
conqueror
of
gaul
and
lord
of
the
world
may
yet
have
only
reigned
by
shakspere
what
hath
all
the
rest
attained
in
the
sugar
bush
i
halted
at
the
margin
of
the
wood
for
tortuous
was
the
path
and
overhead
low
branches
hung
and
roots
and
fragments
rude
of
rock
hindered
the
tardy
foot
i
led
my
timid
horse
that
started
at
our
tread
and
looked
about
on
every
side
in
fear
until
arising
from
the
jocund
shed
the
voice
of
laughter
broke
upon
our
ear
and
through
the
chinks
the
light
shone
out
as
we
drew
near
i
tied
the
bridle
rain
about
a
tree
and
on
the
ample
flatness
of
a
stone
awhile
i
lay
is
very
sweet
to
be
in
social
mirth
domain
unseen
alone
sweet
to
make
others
happiness
one
own
and
he
who
views
the
dance
from
still
recess
or
reads
a
love
tale
in
a
meadow
prone
secures
the
joy
without
the
weariness
and
fills
with
love
delight
nor
feels
its
sore
distress
this
mind
detained
me
in
the
night
but
soon
far
other
thoughts
usurped
my
regal
soul
with
the
supreme
made
fitter
to
commune
when
human
sympathy
illumes
the
scroll
and
points
the
secrets
of
the
mighty
whole
i
spurned
the
earth
to
roam
the
universe
and
with
the
eternal
deadened
time
control
for
refuge
from
the
shadow
of
a
curse
or
lust
of
curious
lore
than
maddest
motive
worse
and
thou
great
essence
of
all
things
that
are
hast
been
to
me
most
prodigal
of
grace
smiled
on
me
in
many
a
twinkling
star
the
morn
hath
showered
kisses
on
my
face
in
nature
arms
thy
bodily
embrace
not
purest
poet
hath
more
fondled
been
is
true
that
i
have
often
thought
to
trace
instead
of
peace
a
harshness
in
thy
mien
and
where
i
beauty
sought
discordant
sights
obscene
but
not
with
aching
heart
i
sought
thee
now
that
thou
numb
with
thy
narcotic
night
the
restless
pulse
oblivious
balm
bestow
infuse
this
frailty
with
thy
glorious
might
and
blind
with
beauty
to
the
mortal
blight
not
even
wilful
love
possessed
me
when
behold
thy
spirit
stole
upon
my
sight
and
ravished
me
what
wonder
that
my
ken
forsook
this
little
world
of
vanity
and
men
and
it
seemed
at
other
times
to
my
imperfect
and
diseas√®d
mind
which
darkened
with
the
shadow
of
men
crimes
thy
virtue
fancying
in
thee
to
find
reflection
of
the
ills
that
shake
mankind
though
on
me
now
a
tempest
broke
and
war
convulsed
the
elements
i
would
perceive
behind
law
harmony
and
purpose
that
falling
star
seems
sped
to
be
the
sun
of
worlds
afar
and
yet
the
scene
was
such
as
often
shares
the
obscurest
soul
no
wondrous
rarity
the
slender
maples
holding
to
the
stars
their
outstretched
arms
as
praying
silently
a
sea
of
stars
a
dancing
dazzling
sea
tremendous
mighty
infinite
supreme
emblem
of
might
eternity
decree
half
crediting
the
mythologic
dream
and
making
of
heaven
th
abode
that
vulgar
fancies
deem
a
common
scene
perchance
but
to
the
mind
which
nature
hath
enlightened
with
her
ray
nothing
in
her
is
not
confined
her
beauty
to
the
sparkle
and
the
play
of
solitary
spring
or
rare
bouquet
of
tropic
flowers
she
hath
grandeur
more
than
crowns
the
mighty
peaks
of
himalay
or
hurtles
in
the
great
niagara
roar
to
me
one
beam
of
light
can
bring
a
priceless
store
nay
more
the
mind
wherein
her
fulness
dwells
can
beauty
and
sublimity
instil
in
all
created
things
till
it
excels
even
herself
though
nurtured
at
her
rill
the
mind
may
be
a
monarch
if
it
will
and
that
of
which
great
nature
is
the
nurse
may
rule
itself
subjecting
every
ill
and
be
the
sun
all
phantoms
to
disperse
and
scatter
glory
round
lord
of
the
universe
what
matter
whether
mortals
own
his
sway
he
knows
his
kingdom
is
not
of
this
world
it
is
within
perchance
some
purer
day
will
see
the
standard
of
his
soul
unfurled
when
good
surviving
sees
the
evil
hurled
to
final
dissolution
and
the
force
of
worlds
no
longer
round
their
centres
whirled
shall
all
combine
and
gather
to
the
source
to
serve
some
nobler
end
if
such
shall
have
recourse
rapt
in
the
purple
transport
of
a
god
pacing
the
ether
with
stride
with
conscious
power
imperial
purpose
shod
and
with
radiating
pride
i
seemed
to
move
nay
move
what
throbbing
side
intenses
immortality
what
brow
thrills
with
severe
conception
deified
as
pallas
such
did
the
gods
allow
i
fear
is
half
a
sin
to
tell
what
i
do
now
if
fire
be
stolen
from
heaven
it
is
not
the
theft
consigns
the
mortal
to
the
shock
of
the
olympian
vengeance
such
the
lot
of
him
whose
earthly
pride
prepares
the
rock
and
taints
the
air
where
the
penal
vultures
flock
whose
welds
the
fettering
chain
then
gods
despise
and
fellow
mortals
mock
and
here
return
me
to
the
theme
i
and
sing
the
simple
labors
of
the
humble
swain
their
voices
told
they
gave
me
welcome
warm
though
oft
their
faces
i
can
scarcely
see
for
now
atween
us
rise
and
swarm
and
rolling
upward
find
their
vent
in
glee
like
more
alas
too
eager
to
be
free
who
fear
to
go
yet
shudder
to
remain
shall
mortal
spirits
then
be
lost
like
ye
is
ours
the
burning
heart
the
boiling
brain
which
yield
the
vapor
but
then
ye
fall
in
rain
ye
fall
in
rain
ye
change
but
are
not
lost
ye
reach
the
ocean
and
the
mighty
sea
absorbs
you
in
her
bosom
with
the
host
who
have
attested
their
eternity
and
if
this
world
we
quicken
so
shall
we
when
this
dim
fluttering
earthly
scene
is
through
commingle
with
the
heroic
and
the
free
the
pure
the
good
the
beautiful
the
true
whose
influence
earth
surrounds
and
sheds
its
freshening
dew
i
oped
the
door
supposing
still
was
night
but
what
a
morn
i
seemed
to
half
intrude
in
sacred
fane
upon
a
holy
rite
a
purpled
crimson
peached
the
east
and
strewed
the
whole
horizon
round
with
tints
and
as
i
forward
rode
and
in
my
hallowed
east
such
vision
viewed
i
thought
of
one
whom
this
glory
glowed
who
like
aurora
soon
would
leave
her
soft
abode
in
may
now
is
the
time
when
swallows
twitter
round
and
robin
redbreasts
carol
in
the
trees
when
the
grass
grows
very
green
on
lower
ground
and
opening
buds
embalm
the
buxom
breeze
when
orchards
murmur
with
the
bees
freed
till
th
uncellared
hives
again
be
full
the
time
when
old
men
smile
and
maidens
please
in
summer
dresses
light
and
cool
and
laughing
urchins
shirk
the
lessons
of
the
school
perchance
it
is
the
hour
when
dawn
unveils
the
visage
of
the
day
when
the
bar
the
radiant
morning
rides
with
saffron
sails
streamers
of
light
on
each
resplendent
spar
fraught
with
rich
gifts
now
sunk
each
faded
star
the
sun
the
sun
the
glorious
lord
of
day
behold
he
comes
before
his
orb√®d
car
caparisoned
with
gold
in
dazzling
play
impatient
dance
his
steeds
to
pace
the
purple
way
or
is
it
in
the
cool
and
tranquil
eve
when
shadows
lengthen
and
the
shades
increase
when
in
the
west
celestial
wonders
weave
gorgeous
nirvanas
of
absorbent
peace
transparency
impenetrable
fleece
clouds
of
all
colors
floating
every
wise
on
which
the
sun
looks
up
before
he
cease
as
some
old
man
a
moment
ere
he
dies
beholds
with
bliss
serene
the
beauties
of
the
skies
the
battle
of
chateauguay
there
is
a
valley
where
the
wheat
fields
wave
in
autumn
like
a
gold
ymolten
sea
there
is
a
river
whose
cool
waters
lave
gardens
groves
and
rolling
lea
and
homes
of
people
worthy
to
be
free
there
is
a
name
whose
sound
is
like
a
song
on
lips
of
its
own
maidens
chateauguay
yet
mighty
as
the
combat
of
the
strong
and
glorious
as
the
march
of
freedom
over
wrong
and
here
they
fought
and
each
encountered
ten
with
and
artillery
arrayed
but
righteous
was
their
cause
and
they
were
men
dark
plumes
of
iroquois
and
scotia
plaid
but
most
the
brothers
of
the
arm
which
made
napoleon
terrible
with
triumphing
between
the
foe
and
heaven
they
knelt
and
prayed
then
rising
heard
their
leader
summons
ring
such
is
our
duty
to
our
god
now
for
our
king
again
they
knelt
but
now
was
not
to
pray
a
volley
crashes
from
their
line
but
tenfold
thunder
mocks
their
mimic
fray
from
furious
gun
and
flashing
carabine
like
roaring
billows
and
the
driving
brine
the
glut
is
backward
hurled
hurrah
is
vain
the
vengeful
fools
like
men
who
war
in
wine
intoxicate
with
madness
overfain
for
blood
have
fired
and
not
a
man
is
slain
meantime
the
valiant
hero
of
the
fight
upon
his
flank
had
foiled
another
foe
who
now
retreating
back
in
broken
plight
dismayed
the
rest
with
vision
of
their
to
see
and
seize
the
leader
is
not
slow
he
rushes
to
his
buglers
bids
them
fast
withdraw
into
the
woods
advance
and
blow
as
for
your
lives
this
effort
were
the
last
yea
blow
as
britain
throne
depended
on
your
blast
away
they
ran
and
wheeling
sharply
blew
the
din
obedient
to
his
word
afar
to
north
and
south
the
echoes
flew
the
indian
child
was
startled
and
the
bird
affrighted
from
its
peaceful
nest
it
stirred
the
sluggish
waters
of
the
swart
outarde
aghast
the
southron
a
great
army
heard
and
fled
before
the
visionary
sword

fled

israel

back
in
ignominy

back

thou
art
holy
ground
and
shall
die
thy
virtue
and
thy
fame
while
still
time
saves
his
best
and
still
shall
states
when
conquest

clapped

with

dust
like
brutes

idlers
base
softly
sweet
river
softly
by
the
cliff
where
in
his
eyrie
the
spent
eagle
sleeps
softly
beside
where
one
cold
and
stiff
a
hapless
lady
her
pale
vigil
keeps
and
come
ye
mourners
very
heaven
weeps
with
rue
and
rosemary
from
far

near
from

beautiful

arising
like
the

of
the

now
winged
and
buttressed
which
the

with
pinnacles
of

rain
for
the
farmer
if
gently
falls
the
small
soft
lazy
rain
to
indoor
industries
he
shrewdly
steals
and
in
the
barn
from
some
neglected
grain
the
choking
chaff
the
clattering
fanner
reels
or
in
the

the

the

now
the
sky
is
black
and
now
the
storm
prepares
his
legions
for
the
coming
fray
while
murmurs
low
prelude
the
dread
alarm
as
prayed
the
hosts
like
rob√®d
monks
who
pray
mid

in
a

gray
till
from
yon
cloud
the
fiery

all
their
terrible
array

flaming

is
olympus
driven
and
thunders
roll
along
the
threshing
floors
of
heaven
hark
to
the
rolling
of
the
sulphurous
sea
upon
its
shores
its
billows
beat
amain
in
angry
tumult
furious
to
be
free
it
rends
the
cloud
with
one
tremendous
strain
the
chasm
is
closed
once
more
again
in
vain
again
again
each
time
enraged
to
yield
it
hurls
its
threats
in
throes
of
titan
pain
while
crouch
the
cattle
their
shield
and
horses
in
terror
hoof
the
field
the
screaming
birds
seek
their
nests
the
swaying
sport
of
panic
and
the
gale
the
tall
trees
trembling
bend
their
creaking
crests
the
ramping
engine
shrieks
upon
the
rail
how
helpless
all
things
seem
how
poor
how
frail
until
the
welkin
warfare
awful
knell
is
voice
of
all
below
in
piteous
wail
alas
for
him
who
toils
in
erie
swell
and
for
the
timid
soul
which
loveth
life
too
well
still
roars
the
thunder
still
the
skies
are
rent
with
frenzied
flame
the
swift
electric
chain
jerked
clanging
backward
when
its
charge
is
spent
such
overhead
but
now
upon
the
plain
there
is
a
lull
a
listening
for
the
rain
the
air
grows
still
she
feels
not
be
long
like
to
a
poet
when
heart
and
brain
the
stern
relentless
tyranny
of
wrong
in
knolling
tumult
he
knows
break
in
song
and
now
at
last
it
comes
crashing
and
cool
and
sweet
well
for
the
earth
and
what
is
sowed
well
for
the
harvest
see
it
fills
the
pool
in
little
streams
goes
leaping
down
the
road
and
now
the
winds
are
joyous
and
they
goad
their
fallen
foe
until
he
half
repeats
his
former
one
might
think
it
snowed
and
sweep
from
the
roofs
like
dust
from
driven
streets
the
spirits
of
the
storm
wrapt
in

over
yon
eastern
all
aglow
her
sickle
gleaming
in

golden

her
arm
upraised
with
sheaf
of
yellow
corn
she
comes
elate
with
light
elastic
pace
her
neck
and

vines
adorn
her
saffron
locks
her
luscious
grace
her
round
and

form
her
fair

face
and
now
the
fields
when
suns
serenely
greet
a
rich
and
mellow
wanton
joy
afford
the
russet
pease
vines
and
the
burnished
wheat
and
whiter
barley
hating
to
be
stored
guarding
with
jealous
spears
their
precious
hoard
the
tapering
dangling
beads
of
gold
in
brilliant
sea
of
beauty
all
outpoured
with
dazzling
depth
of
splendor
all
untold
where
fleets
of
zephyrs
skip
in
fold
that
follows
fold
like
to
a
dream
i
had
but
yesternight
of
pure
transporting
childlike
playfulness
the
presence
of
a
bright
thoughtless
and
words
can
not
express
in
phrase
the
fulness
that
did
bless
entrancingly
my
vision
i
advanced
behind
to
worship
straight
each
golden
tress
was
ruffled
and
about
my
face
they
danced
with
beauty
while
the
maiden
gleeful
glanced
in
anticipation
of
autumn
but
now
the
summer
hastens
to
its
close
and
soon
will
song
a
different
aspect
wear
sweeping
terrific
clad
in
ghostly
snows
and
lit
by
the
flash
of
the
boreal
glare
or
but
a
poet
in
his
easy
chair
and
her
most
pleasing
aspect
now
beguiles
what
time
is
hers
with
deft
endearing
air
with
gorgeous
gold
she
decks
her
garments
whiles
her
melancholy
face
with
indian
summer
smiles
thy
very
smile
sends
sadness
to
my
heart
farewell
sweet
love
the
happy
hour
is
too
well
i
knew
that
we
again
must
part
her
garments
trail
the
fond
reluctant
floor
but
i
shall
forget
the
dress
she
wore
her
looks
her
words
the
pleasing
song
she
sung
is
melody
will
charm
me
more
and
more
is
music
that
will
keep
my
spirit
young
is
joyance
in
my
soul
though
jarring
on
my
tongue
i
hummed
the
music
after
thee
as
well
as
changing
tones
of
youth
allowed
and
fear
and
vexing
sprites
that
choke
the
upward
swell
but
yet
perchance
some
bosom
it
may
cheer
by
recollection
making
thee
more
dear
to
those
who
drunk
thy
music
at
its
spring
to
some
mayhap
who
never
learned
to
hear
alas
poor
wretched
souls
its
sound
may
bring
some
semblance
of
thy
strain
some
wish
to
hear
thee
sing
what
though
i
have
expounded
nothing
new
and
traced
i
trow
unworthily
the
old
song
is
no
mystic
men
may
do
strange
things
in
other
spheres
and
may
unfold
secrets
unthought
tell
tales
before
untold
but
what
thou
wilt
the
bard
nor
less
nor
more
and
to
the
mind
informed
in
nature
mould
thou
has
revealed
thyself
the
same
of
yore
the
same
thou
art
and
shalt
be
evermore
let
them
who
will
content
themselves
to
sing
in
trifling
pageantry
and
gilt
array
to
pluck
the
from
the
shimmering
string
that
skirts
thy
robe
but
such
my
soul
doth
sway
as
makes
me
hang
upon
thy
breast
and
say
love
thee
as
a
mistress
then
mine
own
blindly
and
recklessly
some
future
day
mine
eye
from
thine
clearer
and
stronger
grown
may
thrid
the
straggling
stars
and
search
the
deepening
dawn
o
make
my
soul
an
argosy
of
song
tranquilly
floating
on
a
sea
of
peace
as
with
her
rowers
beautiful
and
strong
some
trireme
bears
among
the
isles
of
greece
with
oars
give
safe
release
from
murky
moorings
storms
and
rocks
that
jar
and
let
its
pearls
in
purity
increase
until
with
singing
sails
it
cross
the
bar
to
melt
in
golden
waves
with
gems
of
many
a
star
