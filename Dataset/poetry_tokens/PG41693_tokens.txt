her

she
saith
two

at

it
seemed
more
like
the
bed
of
death
than
like

he

took

he
kissed
her
on

there
is
more
heaven
in
thy

o

what

thy

i

is
it
the
red

or
the
white
or
that
sweet
kiss
of
thine
no
kiss
no
wine
or
white
or
red
can
make
such
sickness
be
lie
down
and
die
on
thy
for
i
have
poisoned
thee
and
though
the
curse
of
saints
and
men
upon
me
for
it
be
i
would
it
were
to
do
again
since
thou
wert
false
to
me
thou
shouldst
have
loved
or
one
or
none
nor
she
nor
i
loved
twain
but
we
are
twain
thou
hast
undone
and
therefore
art
thou
slain
and
when
before
my
god
i
stand
with
no
base
flesh
between
i
shall
hold
up
this
guilty
hand
and
he
shall
judge
it
clean
he
fell
across
the
bridal
bed
between
the
tapers
pale
i
first
shall
see
our
god
he
said
and
i
will
tell
thy
tale
and
if
god
judge
thee
as
i
do
then
art
thou
justified
i
loved
thee
and
i
was
not
true
and
that
was
why
i
died
if
i
could
judge
thee
thou
shouldst
be
first
of
the
saints
on
high
but
ah
i
fear
god
loveth
thee
not
half
so
dear
as
i
the
ghost
the
year
fades
as
the
west
wind
sighs
and
droops
in
ways
but
your
soft
presence
never
dies
from
out
the
pathway
of
my
days
the
spring
is
where
you
are
but
still
you
from
your
heaven
to
me
can
bring
sweet
dreams
and
flowers
enough
to
fill
a
thousand
empty
worlds
with
spring
i
walk
the
wet
and
leafless
woods
your
shadow
ever
goes
before
and
paints
the
russet
solitudes
with
colours
summer
never
wore
i
sit
beside
my
lonely
fire
the
ghostly
twilight
brings
your
face
and
lights
with
memory
and
desire
my
desolated
among
my
books
i
feel
your
hand
that
turns
the
page
just
past
my
sight
sometimes
behind
my
chair
you
stand
and
read
the
foolish
rhymes
i
write
the
old
piano
keys
i
press
in
random
chords
until
i
hear
your
voice
your
rustling
silken
dress
and
smell
the
violets
that
you
wear
i
do
not
weep
now
any
more
i
think
i
hardly
even
sigh
i
would
not
have
you
think
i
bore
the
kind
of
wound
of
which
men
die
believe
that
smooth
content
has
grown
over
the
ghastly
grave
of
pain
content
o
lips
that
were
my
own
that
i
shall
never
kiss
again
the
modern
judas
for
what
wilt
thou
sell
thy
lord
for
certain
pieces
of
silver
since
wealth
buys
the
good
word
but
the
world
word
how
canst
thou
hear
it
while
thy
brothers
cry
scorn
on
thy
name
and
how
shall
thy
bargain
content
thee
when
thy
brothers
shall
clothe
thee
with
shame
for
what
shall
thy
brother
be
sold
for
the
rosy
garland
of
pleasure
and
the
coveted
crown
of
gold
but
thy
soul
will
turn
them
to
thorns
and
to
heaviness
binding
thy
head
while
women
are
dying
of
shame
and
children
are
crying
for
bread
for
what
wilt
thou
sell
thy
soul
for
the
world
and
what
shall
it
profit
when
thou
shalt
have
gained
the
whole
what
profit
the
things
thou
hast
if
the
thing
thou
art
be
so
mean
wilt
thou
fill
with
the
husks
of
having
the
void
of
the
but
when
my
soul
shall
be
gone
no
more
shall
i
fail
to
profit
by
all
the
deeds
i
have
done
and
wealth
and
the
world
and
pleasure
shall
sing
sweet
songs
in
my
ear
when
the
stupid
soul
is
silenced
which
never
would
let
me
hear
and
if
a
void
there
should
be
i
shall
not
feel
it
or
know
it
it
will
be
nothing
to
me
it
will
be
nothing
to
thee
and
thou
shalt
be
nothing
to
men
but
a
ghost
whose
treasure
is
lost
and
who
shall
not
find
it
again
but
i
shall
have
pleasure
and
praise
praise
shall
not
pleasure
thee
then
nor
pleasure
laugh
in
thy
days
for
as
colour
is
not
without
light
so
happiness
is
not
without
thy
brother
the
lord
whom
thou
soldest
and
the
soul
that
thou
hast
cast
out
the
soul
to
the
ideal
i
will
not
hear
thy
music
sweet
if
i
should
listen
then
i
know
i
should
no
more
know
friend
from
foe
but
follow
thy
capricious
feet
thy
wings
than
mine
so
much
more
fleet
i
will
not
go
i
will
not
go
away
away
from
reeds
and
pool
why
should
i
go
to
where
sun
burns
and
hot
winds
blow
here
sleeps
cool
twilight
all
the
day
do
i
not
love
thy
tune
no
no
i
will
not
say
i
will
not
say
i
love
thy
tune
i
do
not
know
if
so
it
be
it
surely
is
enough
for
me
to
know
i
love
cool
rest
at
noon
spread
thy
bright
wings
ah
go
go
soon
i
will
not
see
i
will
not
see
thy
gleaming
wings
i
will
not
hear
thy
music
clear
it
is
not
love
i
feel
but
fear
i
love
the
song
the
sings
but
thine
which
brings
i
will
not
hear
a
man
of
like
passions
with
it
is
too
late
too
late
the
wine
is
spilled
the
altar
violate
now
all
the
foolish
virtues
of
the
past
its
joys
that
could
not
last
its
flowers
that
had
to
fade
its
bliss
so
long
delayed
its
sun
so
soon
its
faith
so
soon
betrayed
its
prayers
so
madly
prayed
its
right
its
dear
renounced
delight
its
passions
and
its
pain
all
these
stand
gray
about
my
bed
like
ghosts
from
paradise
shut
out
and
i
in
torment
lying
here
alone
see
what
myself
have
done
how
all
good
things
were
butchered
one
by
one
not
one
of
these
but
life
has
fouled
its
name
blotted
it
out
with
sin
and
loss
and
shame
until
my
whole
life
striving
is
made
vain
it
is
too
late
too
late
my
house
is
left
unto
me
desolate
yet
what
if
here
through
this
despair
too
dark
for
dreams
of
fear
through
the
last
bitterness
of
the
last
vain
tear
one
saw
a
face
human
not
turned
away
from
man
disgrace
a
face
divinely
dear
a
head
that
had
a
crown
of
thorns
to
wear
if
there
should
come
a
hand
drawing
this
tired
head
to
a
place
of
rest
on
a
most
loving
breast
and
as
one
felt
that
one
could
almost
bear
to
tell
the
whole
long
sickening
trivial
tale
of
how
one
came
so
utterly
to
fail
of
all
one
once
knew
that
one
might
attain
if
one
should
feel
consoling
arms
about
shutting
one
in
shutting
the
black
past
out
should
feel
the
tears
that
washed
one
clean
again
and
turn
made
dumb
with
love
and
shame
to
hear
my
child
my
child
do
i
not
understand
the
lost
soul
and
the
saved
oh
rapture
of
infinite
peace
many
are
weeping
without
from
the
lost
crowd
of
these
god
thou
hast
lifted
me
out
though
strong
be
the
devil
net
thy
grace
o
god
is
more
strong
i
never
was
tempted
yet
to
even
the
edge
of
wrong
the
world
never
fired
my
brain
the
flesh
never
moved
my
heart
thou
hast
spared
me
the
strife
and
strain
the
struggle
and
sorrow
and
smart
the
dreams
that
never
were
deeds
the
thought
that
shines
not
in
word
the
struggle
that
never
succeeds
thou
hast
saved
me
from
these
o
lord
i
stood
in
my
humble
place
while
those
who
aimed
high
fell
low
oh
the
glorious
gift
of
thy
grace
the
souls
of
thy
saved
ones
know
and
yet
if
in
heaven
at
last
when
all
is
won
and
is
well
dear
hands
stretch
out
from
the
past
dear
voices
call
me
from
hell
my
love
whom
i
long
for
yet
my
little
one
gone
astray
no
god
will
make
me
forget
in
his
own
wise
wonderful
way
oh
the
infinite
marvels
of
grace
oh
the
great
atonement
cost
lifting
my
soul
above
those
other
souls
that
are
lost
mine
are
the
harp
and
throne
theirs
is
the
outer
night
this
my
god
thou
has
done
and
all
that
thou
dost
is
right
ii
lost
as
i
am
degraded
foul
polluted
sunk
in
deep
sloughs
of
failure
and
of
sin
yet
is
my
hell
by
god
great
grace
commuted
for
what
i
lose
the
others
yet
may
win
i
sport
of
flesh
and
fate
in
all
my
living
met
the
world
laughter
and
the
christian
frown
ever
the
spirit
fiercely
vainly
striving
ever
the
flesh
triumphant
laughed
it
down
down
lower
still
but
ever
battling
vainly
dying
to
win
yet
living
to
be
lost
my
soul
through
depths
where
all
its
guilt
showed
plainly
into
the
chaos
of
despair
was
tossed
yet
not
despair
i
see
far
off
a
splendour
here
from
my
hell
i
see
a
heaven
on
high
for
those
brave
men
whom
earth
could
never
render
cowards
as
foul
and
beasts
as
base
as
i
hell
is
not
hell
lit
by
such
consolation
heaven
were
not
heaven
that
lacked
a
thought
like
this
that
though
my
soul
may
never
see
salvation
god
yet
saves
all
these
other
souls
of
his
the
waves
of
death
come

faster
faster

my
heart

it
was
not
i

my
lord
and

the
flesh

thee
not
the
spirit
lord
and
god
be
praised
that
other
men
are
wearing
the
white
white
flower
i
trampled
as
i
trod
that
all
fail
not
that
all
are
not
despairing
that
all
are

i
i
thank
thee

at
the
prison
gate
underneath
us
are
the
everlasting
once
by
a
foreign
prison
gate
deep
in
the
gloom
of
frowning
stone
i
saw
a
woman
desolate
sitting
alone
immeasurable
pain
enwound
infinite
anguish
lapped
her
round
as
the
sea
laps
some
sunken
shore
where
flowers
will
blossom
never
more
despair
sat
shrined
in
her
dry
eyes
her
heart
i
thought
in
blood
must
weep
for
hopes
that
never
more
can
rise
from
their
and
round
her
hovered
phantoms
gray
ghosts
of
delight
dead
many
a
day
and
all
the
thorns
of
life
seemed
wed
in
one
sharp
crown
about
her
head
and
all
the
poor
world
aching
heart
beat
there
i
thought
and
could
not
break
oh
to
be
strong
to
bear
the
smart
the
vast
then
through
my
soul
a
clear
light
shone
what
i
would
do
my
lord
has
done
he
bore
the
whole
world
crown
of
thorn
for
her
sake
too
that
crown
was
worn
the
devil
due
a
priest
tells
how
in
his
youth
a
church
was
built
by
the
free
labour
of
love
as
was
men
wont
in
those
days
and
how
the
stone
and
wood
were
paid
for
by
one
who
had
grown
rich
on
usury
and
the
pillage
of
the
poor
and
of
what
chanced
thereafter
arsenius
priest
of
god
i
tell
for
warning
in
your
younger
ears
humbly
and
plainly
what
befel
that
year
gone
by
a
many
years
when
veraignes
church
was
built
ah
then
brave
churches
grew
hands
of
men
we
see
not
now
their
like
again
we
built
it
on
the
green
that
leans
its
bosom
the
town
so
that
its
presence
sanctified
might
ever
on
our
lives
look
down
we
built
and
those
who
built
not
they
brought
us
their
blessing
day
by
day
and
lingered
to
rejoice
and
pray
for
years
the
masons
toiled
for
years
the
craftsmen
wrought
till
they
had
made
a
church
we
scarce
could
see
for
tears
its
fairness
made
our
love
afraid
its
tracery
stood
out
against
the
deep
bright
sky
like
good
deeds
eternity
in
the
deep
roof
each
separate
beam
had
its
own
garland
ivy
vine
giving
to
man
the
carver
dream
in
sight
of
men
a
certain
sign
and
all
day
long
the
workers
plied
the
church
shall
finished
be
we
cried
and
consecrate
by
our
church
it
was
so
fair
so
dear
so
fit
a
church
to
praise
god
in
it
had
such
show
of
carven
gear
such
chiselled
work
without
within
such
marble
for
the
steps
and
floor
such
and
such
store
of
gold
and
gems
the
altar
bore
each
stone
by
loving
hands
was
hewn
by
loving
hands
each
beam
was
sawn
the
hammers
made
a
merry
tune
in
winter
dusk
and
summer
dawn
love
built
the
house
but
gold
had
paid
for
that
wherewith
the
house
was
made
would
love
had
given
all
we
said
but
poor
in
all
save
love
were
we
and
he
was
poor
in
all
save
gold
who
gave
the
gold
by
usury
were
gained
his
riches
manifold
we
knew
that
if
we
knew
we
thought
is
good
if
men
do
good
in
aught
and
by
good
works
may
heaven
be
bought
at
last
the
echo
died
in
air
of
the
last
stroke
the
silence
then
passed
in
to
fill
the
church
left
bare
of
the
loving
voice
of
christian
men
the
silence
saddened
all
the
sun
so
gladly
was
our
work
begun
now
all
that
happy
work
was
done
did
any
voices
in
the
night
call
through
those
arches
were
there
wings
that
swept
between
the
pillars
white
wide
pinions
of
unvisioned
things
the
priests
who
watched
the
relics
heard
not
of
bat
or
bird
and
moan
of
inarticulate
word
then
sunlight
morning
and
sweet
air
adorned
our
church
and
there
were
borne
great
sheaves
of
boughs
of
blossoms
fair
to
grace
the
consecration
morn
then
round
our
church
trooped
knight
and
dame
within
alone
the
bishop
came
and
the
twelve
candles
leaped
to
flame
then
round
our
church
the
bishop
went
with
all
his
priests
a
brave
array
there
was
no
sign
nor
portent
sent
as
glad
at
heart
he
went
his
way
sprinkling
the
holy
water
round
three
times
on
walls
and
crowd
and
ground
within
the
churchyard
sacred
bound
then
but
ye
know
the
function
scope
at
consecration
all
the
show
of
torch
and
incense
stole
and
cope
and
how
the
acolytes
do
go
before
the
bishop
how
they
bear
the
lighted
tapers
flaming
fair
blown
back
by
the
sweet
wavering
air
the
bishop
knocking
at
the
door
the
deacon
answering
from
within
lift
up
your
heads
ye
gates
be
sure
the
king
of
glory
shall
come
in
the
bishop
passed
in
with
the
choir
thank
god
for
this
our
soul
desire
our
altar
meet
for
heaven
fire
the
bishop
kneeling
in
his
place
where
our
bright
windows
made
day
dim
with
all
heaven
glory
in
his
face
began
the
consecration
hymn
he
sang
in
clear
strong
tone
then
on
the
instant
song
was
done
its
very
echo
scattered
gone
for
as
the
bishop
voice
rang
clear
another
voice
rang
clearer
still
a
voice
wherein
the
soul
could
hear
the
discord
of
unmeasured
ill
and
sudden
breathless
silence
fell
on
all
the
church
and
i
wot
well
there
are
such
silences
in
hell
taper
and
torch
died
down
went
out
and
all
our
church
grew
dark
and
cold
and
deathly
odours
crept
about
and
chill
as
of
the
churchyard
mould
and
every
flower
drooped
its
head
and
all
the
rose
leaves
were
shed
and
all
the
lilies
dropped
down
dead
there
in
the
bishop
chair
we
saw
how
can
i
tell
you
memories
shrink
to
mix
anew
the
cup
of
awe
we
shuddering
mortals
had
to
drink
what
was
it
there
the
shape
that
stood
before
the
altar
and
the
rood
it
was
not
human
flesh
and
blood
a
light
more
bright
than
any
sun
a
shade
more
dark
than
any
night
a
shape
that
human
shape
was
none
a
cloud
a
sense
of
wing√´d
might
and
like
an
infernal
trumpet
sound
rang
through
the
church
hush
profound
a
voice
we
listened
cease
cease
to
consecrate
love
built
the
church
but
it
is
mine
is
built
of
stone
hewn
out
by
hate
cemented
by
man
blood
divine
whence
came
the
gold
that
paid
for
this
from
pillage
of
the
poor
i
wis
that
gold
was
mine
and
mine
this
is
your
king
has
cursed
the
usurer
gold
he
gives
it
to
me
for
my
fee
your
church
is
builded
but
behold
your
church
is
fair
for
me
for
me
who
robs
the
poor
to
me
is
given
impenitent
and
unforgiven
his
church
is
built
for
hell
not
heaven
then
as
we
gazed
the
face
grew
clear
and
all
men
stood
as
turned
to
stone
each
man
beheld
through
dews
of
fear
a
face
his
own
yet
not
his
own
his
own
face
darkened
lost
debased
with
hell
own
signet
stamped
and
traced
and
all
the
god
in
it
effaced
a
crash
like
thunder
shook
the
walls
a
flame
like
lightning
shot
them
through
fly
fly
before
the
judgment
falls
and
all
the
stones
be
fallen
on
you
and
as
we
fled
we
saw
bright
gleams
of
fire
leap
out
joists
and
beams
our
church
oh
love
oh
hopes
oh
dreams
we
stood
without
a
pallid
throng
and
as
the
flame
leaped
high
and
higher
shrill
winds
we
heard
that
rushed
along
and
fanned
the
transports
of
the
fire
the
sky
grew
black
against
the
sky
the
blue
and
scarlet
flames
leaped
high
and
cries
as
of
lost
souls
wailed
by
the
church
in
glowing
vesture
stood
the
lead
ran
down
as
it
were
wax
the
great
stones
cracked
and
burned
like
wood
the
wood
caught
fire
and
flamed
like
flax
a
horrid
chequered
light
and
shade
by
smoke
and
flame
alternate
made
upon
men
upturned
faces
played
down
crashed
the
walls
our
lovely
spire
a
blackened
ruin
fell
and
lay
the
very
earth
about
caught
fire
and
licked
along
the
clay
the
fire
did
neither
stay
nor
spare
till
the
foundations
were
laid
bare
to
the
hot
sickened
air
there
in
the
sight
of
men
it
lay
our
church
that
we
had
made
so
fair
a
heap
of
ashes
white
and
gray
with
sparks
still
gleaming
here
and
there
the
sun
came
out
again
and
shone
on
all
our
loving
work
undone
our
church
destroyed
our
labour
gone
gone
is
it
gone
god
knows
it
no
the
hands
that
builded
built
aright
the
men
who
loved
and
laboured
so
their
church
is
built
in
heaven
height
in
every
stone
a
glittering
gem
gold
in
the
gold
jerusalem
the
church
their
love
built
waits
for
them
love
in
june
through
the
glowing
meadows
aflame
with
buttercup
gold
i
came
to
the
green
still
heart
of
the
wood
a
cooed
and
cooed
the
grew
close
like
leaves
round
the
heart
of
a
rose
round
the
still
green
nest
that
i
chose
then
i
gathered
the
bracken
that
grew
in
a
fairy
forest
all
round
and
i
laid
it
in
heaps
on
the
ground
with
grass
and
blossoms
and
leaves
i
gathered
the
summer
in
sheaves
and
pale
rare
roses
a
few
and
spread
out
a
carpet
meet
for
the
touch
of
my
lady
feet
i
waited
the
wood
was
still
only
one
little
brown
bird
on
a
hazel
swayed
and
stirred
with
the
impulse
of
his
song
and
i
waited
and
time
was
long
then
i
heard
a
step
on
the
grass
in
the
path
where
the
others
pass
and
a
voice
like
a
voice
in
a
dream
and
i
saw
a
glory
a
gleam
a
flash
of
white
through
the
green
her
arms
and
her
gown
are
white
and
the
summer
sighed
her
name
as
she
and
the
sunshine
came
o
sun
and
blue
sky
and
delight
o
eyes
and
lips
of
my
queen
what
was
done
there
or
said
no
one
will
ever
know
for
nobody
saw
or
heard
save
one
little
brown
bright
bird
who
swayed
on
a
twig
overhead
and
he
will
never
betray
but
all
who
pass
by
that
way
as
they
near
the
spot
where
we
lay
among
the
blossoms
and
grass
where
the
leaves
and
the
ferns
lay
thick
though
it
lies
out
of
reach
out
of
sight
of
the
path
where
the
world
may
pass
feel
their
heart
and
their
pulse
beat
quick
in
a
measure
that
rhymes
with
the
leaves
and
flowers
that
rhymes
with
the
summer
and
sun
with
the
lover
to
win
or
won
with
the
crown
of
delight
the
crown
of
love
that
was
ours
the
garden
my
garden
was
lovely
to
see
for
all
things
fair
sweet
flowers
and
blossoms
rare
i
had
planted
there
there
were
pinks
and
lilies
and
stocks
sweet
gray
and
white
stocks
and
rose
and
rue
and
clematis
white
and
blue
and
pansies
and
daisies
and
phlox
and
the
lawn
was
trim
and
the
trees
were
shady
and
all
things
were
ready
to
greet
my
lady
on
the
day
when
she
should
come
to
her
lover
home
to
give
herself
to
me
i
saw
the
red
of
the
roses
the
royal
roses
that
bloomed
for
her
sake
they
shall
lie
i
said
where
my
heart
hopes
lie
they
shall
droop
on
her
heart
and
die
i
dreamed
in
the
is
here
we
will
walk
in
the
july
days
when
the
paths
and
the
lawn
are
ablaze
we
will
walk
here
and
look
at
our
life
great
bliss
and
thank
god
for
this
i
leaned
where
the
jasmine
white
wreathed
all
my
window
round
here
we
will
lean
i
and
my
queen
and
look
out
on
the
broad
moonlight
for
there
shall
be
moonlight
bright
on
my
she
never
saw
the
flowers
that
were
hers
from
their
first
sweet
hours
the
roses
the
pinks
and
the
dark
heartsease
died
in
my
garden
ungathered
forlorn
only
the
jasmine
the
lilies
the
white
white
rose
they
were
gathered
to
honour
and
sorrow
born
they
lay
round
her
touched
her
close
the
jasmine
stars
white
stars
that
about
our
window
their
faint
light
shed
lay
round
her
head
and
the
white
white
roses
lay
on
her
breast
and
a
long
white
lily
lay
in
her
hand
they
lie
by
her
rest
with
her
rest
but
i
unhonoured
unblest
i
stand
outside
in
the
ruined
garden
solitude
where
she
never
stood
on
the
trim
green
sod
which
she
never
trod
and
the
red
red
roses
grow
and
blow
as
if
any
one
cared
how
they
fared
and
the
gate
of
eden
is
shut
and
i
stand
and
see
the
angel
with
flaming
sword
life
pitiless
lord
and
i
know
i
never
may
pass
alas
alas
o
rose
my
rose
i
never
may
reach
the
place
where
she
grows
a
rose
in
the
garden
of
god
prayer
under
gray
skies
o
god
let
there
be
rain
rain
till
this
sky
of
gray
that
covers
us
every
day
be
utterly
wept
away
let
there
be
rain
we
pray
till
the
sky
be
washed
blue
again
let
there
be
rain
o
god
let
there
be
rain
for
the
sky
hangs
heavy
with
pain
and
we
who
walk
upon
earth
we
find
our
days
not
of
worth
none
blesses
the
day
of
our
birth
we
question
of
death
day
in
vain
let
there
be
rain
o
god
let
there
be
rain
till
the
earth
complain
yea
though
it
sweep
away
the
seeds
sown
yesterday
and
beat
down
the
blossoms
of
may
and
ruin
the
border
gay
in
storm
let
this
gray
noon
wane
let
there
be
rain
o
god
let
there
be
rain
till
the
rivers
rise
though
the
waters
go
over
us
quite
and
cover
us
up
from
the
light
and
whelm
us
away
in
the
night
and
the
flowers
of
our
life
be
slain
o
god
let
there
be
rain
o
god
let
there
be
rain
out
of
the
gray
sky
rain
to
wash
the
earth
and
to
wash
the
sky
and
the
sick
sad
souls
of
the
folk
who
sigh
in
the
gray
of
a
sordid
satiety
open
thy
o
god
most
high
and
some
day
send
us
the
sun
again
o
god
let
there
be
rain
a
great
industrial
centre
squalid
street
after
squalid
street
endless
rows
of
them
each
the
same
black
dust
under
your
weary
feet
dust
upon
every
face
you
meet
dust
in
their
hearts
too
or
so
it
seems
dust
in
the
place
of
dreams
spring
in
her
beauty
thrills
and
thrives
here
men
hardly
have
heard
her
name
work
is
the
end
and
aim
of
their
lives
work
work
work
for
their
children
and
wives
work
for
a
life
which
when
it
is
won
is
the
saddest
thing
the
sun
work
one
dark
and
incessant
round
in
black
dull
workshops
out
of
the
light
work
that
others
ease
may
abound
work
that
delight
for
them
may
be
found
work
without
hope
without
pause
without
peace
that
only
in
death
can
cease
brothers
who
live
glad
lives
in
the
sun
what
of
these
men
at
work
in
the
night
god
will
ask
you
what
you
have
done
their
lives
be
required
of
you
every
one
ye
who
were
glad
and
who
liked
life
well
while
they
did
your
work
in
hell
london
voices
speak
to
two
souls
who
thus
reply
i
in
all
my
work
in
all
the
children
play
i
hear
the
ceaseless
hum
of
london
near
it
cries
to
me
i
can
not
choose
but
hear
its
wail
by
night
and
day
so
many
millions
is
it
vain
to
pray
that
all
may
win
such
peace
as
i
have
here
with
books
and
work
and
little
children
dear
that
flowers
like
mine
may
grow
along
their
way
through
all
my
happy
life
i
hear
the
cry
the
exceeding
bitter
cry
of
human
pain
and
shudder
as
the
deathless
wail
sweeps
by
i
can
do
nothing
even
hope
is
vain
that
the
bright
light
of
peace
and
purity
in
those
lost
souls
may
ever
shine
again
ii
pine
woods
whisper
and
the
hum
of
bees
i
heard
a
voice
that
was
not
bee
nor
wood
here
in
the
city
gold
has
trampled
good
come
thou
do
battle
till
this
strife
shall
cease
i
left
the
mill
the
meadows
and
the
trees
and
came
to
do
the
little
best
i
could
for
these
god
poor
and
oh
my
god
i
would
i
had
a
thousand
lives
to
give
for
these
what
can
one
hand
do
a
world
of
wrong
yet
when
the
voice
said
come
how
could
i
stay
the
foe
is
mighty
and
the
battle
long
and
love
is
sweet
and
there
are
flowers
in
may
and
good
seems
weak
and
gold
is
very
strong
but
while
these
fight
i
dare
not
turn
away
the
sick
journalist
throb
throb
throb
weariness
ache
and
pain
one
heart
and
one
eyes
on
fire
and
never
a
spark
in
one
brain
the
stupid
paper
and
ink
that
might
be
turned
into
gold
lie
here
unused
since
one
brain
refused
to
do
its
tricks
as
of
old
one
can
suffer
still
indeed
but
one
can
not
think
any
more
there
no
fire
in
the
grate
no
food
on
the
plate
and
the
shrieks
through
the
door
the
sunshine
grins
in
the
street
it
used
to
cheer
me
like
wine
now
it
only
quickens
my
brain
sick
beat
and
the
children
are
crying
for
bread
to
eat
and
i
can
not
write
a
line

cradle

curtains

warm
woolly
blankets

with
soft
white
pillows

thy
head

little
hands

life

see
nor
pain

strife
nor
the
low
ills
of
common
life
these
little
feet
shall
never
tread
except
on
paths
and
all
life
flowers
in
wreaths
shall
twine
to
deck
that
darling
head
of
thine
thou
shalt
have
overflowing
measure
of
wealth
and
joy
and
peace
and
pleasure
and
thou
shalt
be
right
charitable
with
all
the
crumbs
that
leave
thy
table
and
thou
shalt
praise
god
every
day
for
his
good
gifts
that
come
thy
way
and
again
thank
him
and
again
that
thou
art
not
as
other
men

thy
wealth

golden
home
in
heaven

though
the
wind
is
cruel
and
cold
and
my
shawl
that
i
wrapped
thee
in
is
old
and
ragged
and
thin
and
my
hand
is
too
frozen
to
hold
yet
my
bosom
still
warm
so
creep
close
to
thy
mother
and
sleep
sleep
little
baby
and
rest
though
we
wander
alone
through
the
night
and
there
is
no
food
for
me
no
shelter
for
me
and
thee
through
the
windows
red
fires
shine
bright
and
tables
show
heaped
with
the
best
but
there
naught
for
us
there
so
rest
sleep
you
poor
little
thing
just
as
pretty
and
dear
as
any
fine
lady
child

manger
hay
he
was
a
baby
if
tales
tell
true
just
like
you
and
he
had
no
crown
to

his
bright
hair

give
you

with

my
little

sleep
my
dear
all
too
soon
will
the
day
be
here
an
tragedy
you
said
that
you
would
never
wed
my
love
my
life
one
work
lie
here
crowded
alleys
dank
and
drear
where
all
life
are
shed
you
said
i
heard
i
bowed
to
what
i
heard
i
bowed
my
head
and
worshipped
you
so
brave
so
beautiful
so
true
how
could
i
doubt
a
single
word
i
heard
my
sweet
white
lily
all
the
street
as
you
passed
by
grew
clean
again
the
fallen
blackened
souls
of
men
looked
heavenward
when
men
heard
your
feet
my
sweet
but
one
came
dared
to
woo
and
won
he
heard
your
vows
and
laughed
at
them
he
plucked
my
lily
from
its
stem
sacred
to
all
men
under
sun
but
one
here
and
there
ah
me
how
hot
and
weary
here
in
town
the
days
crawl
by
how
otherwise
they
go
my
heart
records
where
the
marsh
meadows
lie
and
white
sheep
crop
the
grass
and
seagulls
sail
between
the
lovely
earth
and
lovely
sky
here
the
sun
grins
along
the
dusty
street
beneath
pale
skies
hark
spiritless
sad
tramp
of
toiling
feet
hoarse
hawkers
curses
cries
through
these
i
hear
the
song
that
the
sea
sings
to
the
far
meadowlands
of
paradise
o
church
and
barn
o
long
sweet
days
o
changing
unchanged
skies
straight
dykes
all
gay
with
sedge
and
water
mace
o
fair
marsh
land
desirable
and
dear
how
far
from
you
lie
my
life
weary
ways
yet
in
my
darkest
night
there
shines
a
star
more
fair
than
day
there
is
a
flower
that
blossoms
sweet
and
white
in
the
sad
city
way
that
flower
blooms
not
where
the
wide
marshes
gleam
that
star
shines
only
when
the
skies
are
gray
for
here
fair
peace
and
passionate
pleasure
wane
before
the
light
of
radiant
dreams
that
make
our
lives
worth
life
and
turn
to
noon
our
night
we
fight
for
freedom
and
the
souls
of
men
here
and
not
there
is
fought
and
won
our
fight
mother
a
little
room
with
scanty
grace
of
drapery
or
ordered
ease
white
dimity
and
boards
but
there
a
hum
of
summer
bees
the
sun
sends
through
the
quiet
place
the
scent
that
honeysuckle
hoards
outside
the
little
garden
glows
with
leaves
and
blossoms
bright
beyond
lie
meadow
lane
and
wood
where
trail
the
briony
and
wild
rose
and
where
grow
blossoms
of
delight
in
an
inviolate
solitude
through
that
green
world
there
blows
an
air
that
cools
my
forehead
even
here
in
this
sad
city
riotous
roar
and
from
that
room
my
ears
can
hear
tears
and
the
echo
of
a
prayer
and
the
world
voice
is
heard
no
more
a
ballad
of
canterbury
across
the
grim
gray
northern
sea
the
danish
warships
went
and
manned
by
mighty
men
on
blood
and
plunder
bent
and
they
landed
on
a
smiling
land
the
of
kent
they
sacked
the
farms
they
spoiled
the
corn
they
set
the
ricks
aflame
they
slew
the
men
with
axe
and
sword
they
slew
the
maids
with
shame
until
to
canterbury
town
made
mad
with
blood
they
came
archbishop
alphege
walked
the
wall
and
looked
down
on
the
foe
now
fly
my
lord
his
monks
implored
while
yet
a
man
may
go
shame
on
you
monks
of
mine
he
cried
to
shame
your
bishop
so
what
would
you
have
the
shepherd
flee
like
any
hireling
knave
what
leave
my
church
my
poor
god
poor
to
a
dark
and
prayerless
grave
no
by
the
body
of
my
lord
skin
i
will
not
save
and
when
men
heard
his
true
strong
word
they
bore
them
as
men
should
for
twenty
nights
and
twenty
days
the
foemen
they
withstood
and
day
and
night
shone
tapers
bright
and
incense
veiled
the
rood
the
warriors
manned
the
walls
without
the
monks
prayed
on
within
till
satan
wroth
to
see
how
prayer
and
valour
fared
to
win
whispered
a
traitor
who
stole
out
and
let
the
foemen
in
then
through
the
quiet
church
there
ran
a
sudden
breath
of
fear
the
monks
made
haste
to
bar
the
door
and
hide
the
golden
gear
and
to
their
lord
once
more
they
cried
hide
hide
the
foe
is
here
through
all
the
church
windows
showed
the
sudden
laugh
of
flame
along
the
street
went
trampling
feet
and
through
the
smoke
there
came
the
voice
of
women
calling
shrill
upon
the
saviour
name
and
hide
oh
hide
the
monks
all
cried
nor
meet
such
foes
as
these
be
still
he
said
hide
if
ye
will
live
on
and
take
your
ease
by
my
lord
death
latest
breath
like
his
shall
speak
of
peace
he
strode
along
the
dusky
aisle
and
flung
the
church
doors
wide
bright
armour
shone
and
blazing
homes
lit
up
the
world
outside
and
in
the
streets
reeled
to
and
fro
a
bloody
human
tide
the
mailed
barbarians
laughed
aloud
to
see
the
brave
blood
flow
they
trampled
on
the
breast
and
hair
of
girls
their
swords
laid
low
and
on
the
points
of
reeking
spears
tossed
babies
to
and
fro
alphege
stood
forth
his
pale
face
gleamed
against
the
dark
red
tide
forbear
your
cup
of
guilt
is
full
your
sins
are
red
he
cried
spare
these
poor
sheep
my
lambs
for
whom
the
king
of
heaven
died
drunken
with
blood
and
lust
of
fight
loud
laughed
thorkill
the
dane
stand
thou
and
see
us
shear
thy
sheep
before
thy
foolish
fane
hear
how
they
weep
they
bleat
thy
sheep
that
thou
mayst
know
their
pain
he
stood
and
saw
his
monks
all
slain
the
altar
steps
ran
red
in
horrid
heaps
men
lay
about
the
dying
with
the
dead
and
the
east
brightened
and
the
sky
grew
rosy
overhead
then
from
the
church
a
tiny
puff
of
smoke
rose
the
sky
out
broke
the
fire
and
flame
on
flame
leaped
palely
out
on
high
till
but
the
church
walls
were
left
for
men
to
know
it
by
and
when
the
sweet
sun
laughed
again
fields
and
furrows
brown
the
brave
archbishop
hid
his
eyes
until
the
tears
dropped
down
on
the
charred
blackness
of
the
wreck
of
canterbury
town
now
saxon
shepherd
send
a
word
unto
thy
timid
sheep
and
bid
them
greaten
up
their
hearts
and
to
our
feet
dare
creep
and
bring
a
ransom
here
which
we
instead
of
thee
may
keep
archbishop
alphege
stood
alone
bruised
beaten
loaded
with
chains
with
aching
heart
and
wounded
in
the
side
and
in
his
hour
of
utmost
pain
thus
to
the
dane
replied
ye
men
of
blood
my
blood
shall
flow
before
this
thing
shall
be
if
i
be
held
till
ransom
come
i
never
shall
be
free
for
by
god
heart
god
poor
shall
never
be
robbed
to
ransom
me
they
flung
him
in
a
dungeon
dark
they
heaped
on
him
fresh
chains
they
promised
him
unnumbered
ills
and
unimagined
pains
but
still
he
said
no
english
shall
be
taxed
to
profit
danes
six
months
passed
by
no
ransom
came
their
threats
had
almost
ceased
when
thorkill
held
on
a
great
and
brutal
feast
and
they
sent
and
dragged
the
christian
man
before
the
pagan
beast
down
the
great
hall
from
east
to
west
the
long
rough
tables
ran
they
roasted
oxen
sheep
and
deer
and
then
the
drink
began
at
last
in
all
that
mighty
hall
was
not
one
sober
man
was
then
they
brought
the
bishop
forth
before
the
drunken
throng
and
send
for
ransom
thorkill
cried
you
are
weak
and
we
are
strong
or
by
the
hand
of
thor
you
die
we
have
borne
with
you
too
long
the
savage
faces
of
the
danes
leered
redly
all
around
the
bones
of
beasts
and
empty
cups
lay
heaped
upon
the
ground
and
the
crowd
of
howling
wolves
the
christian
saint
stood
bound
he
looked
in
thorkill
angry
eyes
and
knew
what
thing
should
be
then
spake
by
god
who
died
to
save
the
poor
and
me
and
thee
thou
art
not
strong
enough
god
poor
shall
not
be
taxed
for
me
gold
give
us
gold
or
die
all
round
the
rising
tumult
ran
i
give
my
life
i
give
god
word
i
give
what
gifts
i
can
bleed
christian
sheep
for
pagan
wolves
find
you
some
other
man
and
as
he
spake
the
whole
crowd
rose
with
one
fierce
shout
and
yell
they
flung
at
him
the
bones
of
beasts
they
aimed
right
strong
and
well
o
christ
o
shepherd
guard
thy
sheep
the
bishop
cried
and
fell
and
so
men
call
him
saint
yet
some
deemed
this
an
unearned
crown
since
was
not
for
the
church
or
faith
he
laid
his
brave
life
down
but
otherwise
men
deemed
of
it
in
canterbury
town
not
for
the
church
he
died
they
said
yet
he
our
saint
shall
be
since
for
christ
poor
he
gave
his
life
so
for
christ
self
died
he
does
it
to
the
least
of
these
has
done
it
unto
me
morning
it
was
about
the
time
of
day
when
all
the
lawns
with
dew
are
wet
i
wandered
down
a
steep
and
there
i
met
with
margaret
her
hands
were
full
of
boughs
of
may
it
was
the
merest
chance
we
met
i
could
not
find
a
word
to
say
and
she
was
silent
too
and
yet
for
hand
and
lips
i
dared
to
pray
and
margaret
did
not
say
me
nay
still
on
my
lips
her
kisses
stay
her
eyes
are
like
the
violet
will
time
take
this
joy
too
away
and
ever
teach
me
to
forget
and
to
forget
without
regret
the
dawn
the
woods
and
margaret
the
prayer
they
talk
of
money
and
of
fame
would
make
a
fortune
or
a
name
and
gold
and
laurel
both
must
be
for
ever
out
of
reach
of
me
and
if
i
asked
of
god
or
fate
the
gift
most
gracious
and
most
great
it
would
not
be
such
gifts
as
these
that
i
should
pray
for
on
my
knees
no
i
should
ask
a
greater
grace
a
little
quiet
firelit
place
where
she
should
hold
my
baby
on
her
knee
there
she
should
sit
and
softly
sing
the
songs
my
heart
hears
echoing
and
i
made
pure
by
joy
should
come
not
all
unworthy
to
our
home
but
if
i
dared
to
ask
this
grace
would
not
god
laugh
out
in
my
face
since
gold
and
fame
indeed
are
his
to
give
but
ah
not
this
not
this
the
river
maidens
when
autumn
winds
the
river
grieve
and
autumn
mists
about
it
creep
the
river
maids
all
shivering
leave
the
stream
and
singing
sink
to
sleep
the
wind
the
bitter
snow
alike
are
impotent
to
break
the
spell
of
sleep
that
laid
them
low
the
lovely
ladies
will
not
wake
but
when
the
spring
with
lavish
grace
strews
blossom
on
the
river
breast
flowers
fall
upon
each
sleeping
face
and
break
the
deep
and
dreamless
rest
then
with
white
arms
that
gleam
afar
through
alders
green
and
willows
gray
they
rise
where
sedge
and
iris
are
and
laugh
beneath
the
blossomed
may
they
lie
beside
the
river
edge
by
fields
with
buttercups
they
whisper
in
the
whispering
sedge
they
say
the
spell
the
cuckoo
says
and
when
they
hear
the
nightingale
and
see
the
blossomed
hawthorn
tree
what
time
the
orchard
pink
grows
pale
the
river
maidens
beckon
me
through
all
the
city
smoke
appear
white
arms
and
golden
hair
and
through
the
noise
of
life
i
hear
come
back
to
the
enchanted
stream
come
back
to
water
wood
and
weir
see
what
the
summer
has
to
show
come
back
come
back
we
too
are
here
i
hear
them
calling
and
i
go
but
when
once
more
my
dripping
oar
makes
music
on
the
dreaming
air
i
vainly
look
to
stream
and
shore
for
those
white
arms
that
lured
me
there
i
listen
to
the
singing
weir
i
hold
my
breath
where
thrushes
are
but
i
can
never
never
hear
the
voice
that
called
me
from
afar
only
when
spring
grows
fair
next
year
even
where
sin
and
cities
be
i
know
what
voices
i
shall
hear
and
what
white
arms
will
beckon
me
on
the
medway
i
in
summer
evening
love
we
glide
by
grassy
meadows
red
sun
is
shining
day
is
declining
peace
is
around
above
the
poplar
folds
on
high
dark
wings
against
the
sky
through
dreaming
shadows
on
we
move
silently
you
and
i
and
seaward
still
we
row
by
sedge
and
bulrush
sliding
breezes
are
sending
ripples
unending
over
the
way
we
go
above
the
poplar
tree
the
moon
sails
white
and
free
the
boat
goes
gliding
swift
or
slow
but
ever
towards
the
sea
ii
dip
drip
in
and
out
the
rhythmic
oars
move
slowly
round
about
the
pale
sky
reddens
wholly
chill
still
through
waxing
light
mystical
and
tender
morn
born
of
starlit
night
clothes
herself
with
splendour
in
eastern
sky
in
the
north
faint
flushes
boat
float
idly
by
past
the
sedge
and
rushes
here
near
the
willow
screen
bathe
gaily
white
bright
against
the
green
poets
see
them
daily
see
we
we
alone
greet
this
fresh
too
few
who
hail
day
done
see
it
in
the
making
sad
glad
we
two
see
dawn
the
earth
adorning
sigh
why
can
no
noon
be
worth
so
gold
a
morning
iii
it
was
beside
a
wide
white
weir
where
the
foam
dances
in
the
sun
the
butterflies
are
fair
this
year
and
the
weir
there
hovered
one
a
cottage
curled
its
smoke
against
a
blue
and
perfect
sky
there
love
triumphant
laughed
and
woke
and
we
were
silent
you
and
i
love
stirred
in
sleep
reached
out
his
hands
and
sighed
and
smiled
and
stood
upright
then
fell
the
careful
cobweb
bands
with
which
our
will
had
bound
his
might
his
royal
presence
made
us
still
our
will
was
water
matched
with
his
like
he
broke
our
will
and
joined
our
lips
in
our
first
kiss
iv
look
out
the
stars
are
shining
the
dew
makes
gray
the
meadow
the
jasmine
stars
are
twining
about
your
window
bright
the
green
are
creeping
on
lawns
all
dressed
in
shadow
the
roses
all
are
sleeping
my
heart
the
nightingale
is
singing
her
song
of
ceaseless
sorrow
the
night
slow
feet
pass
bringing
the
day
when
i
rejoice
belov√®d
beyond
measure
our
bridal
is
oh
thrill
the
night
with
pleasure
oh
let
me
hear
thy
voice
from
cloudy
confines
sliding
the
moon
sails
white
and
splendid
no
roses
now
are
hiding
the
glory
of
their
grace
so
if
my
song
thou
hearest
for
thee
begun
and
ended
light
up
the
night
my
dearest
and
let
me
see
thy
face
o
gleaming
gliding
river
where
ash
and
alder
lean
where
sighing
sedges
shiver
by
willows
gray
and
green
upon
thy
shifting
shadows
the
yellow
lily
lies
and
all
along
thy
meadows
grow
flowers
of
paradise
the
village
sleeping
soft
sounds
of
farm
and
fold
the
dappled
shadows
creeping
the
sunset
rose
and
gold
twilight
of
mist
and
glamour
noontide
of
sunlit
ease
how
life
sordid
clamour
our
hearts
will
long
for
these
yet
since
at
heart
we
treasure
these
weirs
and
woods
and
fields
this
crown
of
lovely
leisure
which
kentish
country
yields
these
these
are
ours
for
ever
though
days
be
done
through
all
our
dreams
our
river
will
evermore
flow
on
vi
when
all
is
over
lay
me
down
far
from
this
dull
and
jaded
town
not
in
a
churchyard
ordered
bound
but
in
some
wide
green
no
stone
upon
me
above
all
let
no
cold
railing
shadows
fall
across
my
rest
dead
let
me
be
what
no
one
may
be
living
free
let
no
one
mourning
garments
wear
and
if
you
love
me
shed
no
tear
do
weight
me
with
a
heap
but
plant
the
daisies
where
i
sleep
there
is
a
certain
field
i
know
i
met
my
dear
there
years
ago
perhaps
if
you
should
speak
them
fair
they
let
you
lay
her
lover
there
laid
there
perhaps
my
ears
would
hear
the
ceaseless
singing
of
the
weir
the
soft
wind
sighing
thro
the
grass
and
hear
the
little
children
pass
or
if
my
ears
were
stopped
with
clay
from
all
sweet
sounds
of
night
and
day
i
should
at
least
so
lay
me
there
sleep
better
there
than
anywhere
the
betrothal
there
is
none
anywhere
so
beautiful
as
she
nor
half
so
dear
my
heart
sings
ever
when
she
draweth
near
because
she
is
so
good
and
sweet
and
fair
i
may
not
be
the
one
to
break
the
cloistered
stillness
of
her
life
to
teach
her
passion
and
love
and
grief
and
strife
and
lead
her
through
the
garden
of
the
sun
for
i
am
sad
and
wise
i
have
no
hopes
no
dreams
no
fancies
none
yet
she
has
taught
me
that
i
am
alone
and
what
men
mean
who
talk
of
paradise
but
when
her
joybells
ring
i
think
perhaps
that
i
shall
hear
and
sigh
and
wish
the
roses
did
not
have
to
die
and
that
the
birds
might
never
cease
to
sing
a
tragedy
i
among
his
books
he
sits
all
day
to
think
and
read
and
write
he
does
not
smell
the
hay
the
roses
red
and
white
i
walk
among
them
all
alone
his
silly
stupid
wife
the
world
seems
tasteless
dead
and
done
an
empty
thing
is
life
at
night
his
window
casts
a
square
of
light
upon
the
lawn
i
sometimes
walk
and
watch
it
there
until
the
chill
of
dawn
i
have
no
brain
to
understand
the
books
he
loves
to
read
i
only
have
a
heart
and
hand
he
does
not
seem
to
need
he
calls
me
child
lays
on
my
hair
thin
fingers
cold
and
mild
oh
god
of
love
who
answers
prayer
i
wish
i
were
a
child
and
no
one
sees
and
no
one
knows
he
least
would
know
or
see
that
ere
love
gathers
next
year
rose
death
will
have
gathered
me
and
on
my
grave
will
bindweed
pink
and
daisies
grow
still
will
read
and
write
and
think
and
never
never
know
ii
it
lonely
in
my
study
here
alone
now
you
are
gone
i
loved
to
see
your
white
gown
the
flowers
while
hours
on
hours
i
studied
toiled
to
weave
a
crown
of
fame
about
your
name
i
liked
to
hear
your
sweet
low
laughter
ring
to
hear
you
sing
about
the
house
while
i
sat
reading
here
my
child
my
dear
to
know
you
glad
with
all
the
fair
i
dared
not
share
i
thought
there
would
be
time
enough
to
show
my
love
to
throw
some
day
with
crowns
of
laurel
at
your
feet
love
roses
sweet
i
thought
i
could
taste
love
when
fame
was
won
now
both
are
done
thank
god
your
knew
not
how
to
miss
the
passionate
kiss
which
i
dared
never
give
lest
love
should
rise
mighty
unwise
and
bind
me
with
my
incomplete
beside
your
feet
you
never
knew
you
lived
and
were
content
my
one
chance
went
you
died
my
little
one
and
are
at
rest
and
i
unblest
look
at
these
broken
fragments
of
my
life
my
child
my
wife
love
i
desire
of
the
moth
for
the
the
wide
white
woods
are
still
as
death
or
sleep
silent
with
snow
and
sunshine
and
crisp
air
save
when
the
brief
keen
sudden
breezes
sweep
through
frozen
rustling
everywhere
no
leaves
are
here
nor
buds
for
gathering
but
in
her
garden
risen
from
summer
tomb
to
bear
the
gospel
of
eternal
spring
the
christmas
roses
bloom
o
heart
of
mine
we
two
once
dreamed
of
days
pure
from
all
sordid
soil
and
worldly
stain
like
this
wide
stretch
of
white
untrodden
ways
ah
that
such
dreams
should
always
be
in
vain
we
too
in
bitterest
sorrow
wintry
hour
too
chill
to
let
the
redder
roses
blow
we
too
had
our
delicious
hidden
flower
that
blossomed
in
life
snow
o
heart
if
we
again
might
hope
to
be
pure
as
the
snow
or
christmas
roses
white
if
dreams
and
deeds
might
but
be
one
to
me
and
one
to
thee
be
duty
and
delight
if
that
may
ever
be
one
hand
we
know
must
beckon
us
along
the
way
she
goes
the
hand
of
her
as
pure
as
any
snow
and
sweet
as
any
rose
ii
i
passed
beneath
the
stately
norman
portal
i
trod
the
stones
that
pilgrim
feet
have
trod
i
passed
between
the
pillars
tall
and
slender
that
yearn
to
heaven
as
man
soul
yearns
to
god
the
coloured
glory
of
the
pictured
windows
fell
on
me
as
i
kneeled
before
the
shrine
where
round
the
image
of
the
the
countless
flames
of
tapers
shine
the
hymn
rose
on
the
wings
of
children
voices
the
incense
thrilled
my
soul
to
voiceless
prayer
with
scent
of
dear
dead
days
and
years
forgotten
and
all
the
soul
of
all
the
past
was
there
but
in
my
heart
as
there
i
kneeled
before
her
not
to
the
the
winged
prayers
flew
they
passed
her
by
and
sought
instead
your
presence
the
incense
of
my
soul
was
burned
for
you
for
you
for
you
were
all
the
tapers
lighted
for
you
the
flowers
were
on
the
altar
laid
for
you
the
hymn
rose
thrilling
through
the
chancel
to
the
clerestory
mysteries
of
shade
to
you
the
anthems
of
a
thousand
churches
rose
where
the
flames
burned
clear
to
you
through
all
these
leagues
of
deathly
distance
to
you
as
unattainable
as
dear
dear
as
the
dreams
life
never
brings
to
blossom
lost
as
the
seeds
hope
sowed
which
never
grew
pure
as
the
love
which
only
you
could
waken
prayer
incense
tears
and
love
were
all
for
you
iii
when
god
some
day
shall
call
my
name
and
scorch
me
with
a
blaze
of
shame
bringing
to
light
my
inmost
thought
and
all
the
evil
i
have
wrought
tearing
away
the
veils
i
wove
to
hide
my
foulness
from
my
love
and
leaving
my
transgressions
bare
to
the
whole
heaven
clear
cold
air
when
all
the
angels
weep
to
see
the
branded
outcast
soul
of
me
one
saint
at
least
will
hide
her
face
she
will
not
look
at
my
disgrace
at
least
o
god
o
god
most
high
he
loved
me
truly
she
will
cry
and
god
will
pause
before
he
send
my
soul
to
find
its
fitting
end
then
lest
heaven
light
should
leave
her
face
to
think
one
loved
her
and
was
base
i
will
speak
out
at
judgment
day
i
never
loved
her
i
will
say
love
song
light
of
my
life
though
far
away
my
sun
you
shine
your
radiance
warms
me
every
day
like
fire
or
wine
life
of
my
heart
in
every
beat
this
sad
heart
gives
it
owns
your
sovereignty
complete
by
which
it
lives
heart
of
my
soul
serene
and
strong
eyes
of
my
sight
together
we
can
do
no
wrong
apart
no
right
the
quarrel
come
down
my
dear
from
this
high
hill
where
the
wild
plovers
scream
against
the
sky
down
in
the
valley
everything
is
still
we
also
will
be
silent
you
and
i
come
down
and
hold
my
hand
as
we
go
down
a
gleam
of
sun
has
dyed
the
west
afar
the
lights
come
out
down
in
the
little
town
the
first
glimmer
of
the
evening
star
did
my
heart
forge
the
bitter
words
i
said
did
your
heart
breed
those
bitterer
replies
spoken
with
plovers
wheeling
overhead
in
the
gray
pallor
of
the
cheerless
skies
is
it
worth
while
to
quarrel
and
upbraid
life
being
so
little
and
love
so
great
a
thing
the
price
of
all
life
follies
has
been
paid
when
we
true
lovers
fall
to
quarrelling
here
is
the
churchyard
swing
the
gate
and
pass
where
the
sharp
needles
of
the
pines
are
shed
tread
here
between
the
mounds
of
flowered
grass
tread
softly
over
these
forgotten
dead
we
are
alive
and
here
o
love
o
wife
while
life
is
ours
and
we
are
yours
and
mine
how
dare
we
crush
the
blossom
of
our
life
how
dare
we
spill
love
sacramental
wine
kiss
me
forget
we
two
are
living
now
and
life
is
all
too
short
for
love
my
dear
when
one
of
us
beneath
these
flowers
lies
low
the
other
will
remember
we
kissed
here
some
one
some
day
will
come
here
all
alone
and
look
out
on
the
desolated
years
with
bitter
tears
of
longing
for
the
one
who
will
not
then
be
here
to
dry
the
tears
change
there
a
little
house
by
an
orchard
side
where
the
spring
wears
pink
and
white
there
a
garden
with
pansies
and
london
pride
and
a
bush
of
lad
delight
through
the
hedge
is
the
garden
seen
as
trim
as
a
garden
can
be
and
the
grass
of
the
orchard
is
much
more
green
than
most
of
the
grass
you
see
there
used
to
be
always
a
mother
smile
and
a
father
face
at
the
door
when
one
clambered
over
the
orchard
stile
so
glad
to
be
home
once
more
but
now
i
never
go
by
that
way
for
when
i
was
there
of
late
a
stranger
was
cutting
the
orchard
hay
and
a
stranger
leaned
on
the
gate
the
mill
the
wheel
goes
round
the
wheel
goes
round
with
drip
and
whir
and
plash
it
keeps
all
green
the
grassy
ground
the
alder
beech
and
ash
the
ferns
creep
out
mosses
cool
are
found
blue
in
the
shadow
by
the
pool
and
still
the
wheel
goes
round
round
goes
the
wheel
round
goes
the
wheel
the
foam
is
white
like
cream
the
merry
waters
dance
and
reel
along
the
stony
stream
the
little
garden
of
the
mill
it
is
enchanted
ground
i
smell
its
stocks
and
still
and
still
the
wheel
goes
round
the
wheel
goes
round
the
wheel
goes
round
and
life
wheel
too
must
go
but
all
their
clamour
has
not
drowned
a
voice
i
used
to
know
her
window
blank
the
garden
bare
as
her
chill
mound
but
still
my
heart
delight
is
there
and
still
the
wheel
goes
round
rondeau
a
red
red
rose
all
wet
with
dew
with
leaves
of
green
by
red
shot
through
and
sharp
thin
thorns
and
scent
that
brings
delicious
memories
of
lost
things
a
red
rose
sweet
yet
sad
as
rue
was
a
red
rose
you
gave
me
you
whose
gifts
so
sacred
were
and
few
and
that
is
why
your
lover
sings
a
red
red
rose
i
sing
with
lute
untuned
untrue
and
worse
than
other
lovers
do
because
perplexing
memory
stings
because
from
your
green
grave
there
springs
with
your
spilt
coloured
through
a
red
red
rose
a
m√©salliance
i
hear
sweet
music
rich
gowns
i
wear
i
live
in
splendour
and
state
but
i
give
it
all
to
be
young
once
more
and
steal
through
the
old
door
to
watch
at
the
orchard
gate
there
are
flowers
by
thousands
these
bear
fair
blossoms
wondrous
and
new
but
all
the
flowers
that
a
grows
i
would
give
for
the
scent
of
a
certain
rose
that
a
cottage
garden
grew
oh
diamonds
that
sparkle
on
bosom
and
hair
oh
rubies
that
glimmer
and
glow
i
am
tired
of
my
bargain
and
tired
of
you
i
would
give
you
all
for
a
daisy
or
two
from
a
little
grave
i
know
the
last
thought
it
weary
lying
here
while
my
throbbing
forehead
echoes
all
the
hum
of
london
near
and
oh
my
heart
is
heavy
in
this
dull
and
darkened
room
when
i
think
about
our
village
where
the
orchards
are
in
bloom
our
little
village
where
the
cherry
orchards
are
so
far
away
so
far
they
say
that
i
shall
die
and
i
tired
and
life
is
noisy
and
the
good
days
have
gone
by
but
oh
my
village
i
should
die
with
more
content
could
i
see
again
your
gables
and
the
orchard
slopes
of
kent
and
the
eyes
that
look
out
vainly
from
a
cottage
door
for
one
who
comes
no
more
apollo
and
the
men
of
cym√©
herodotus
i
what
be
these
messengers
who
come
between
the
images
that
guard
our
roadway
beneath
the
heavy
shadow
of
the
laurels
whence
be
these
men
and
wherefore
have
they
come
we
come
to
crave
the
counsel
of
apollo
the
men
of
cym√©
he
has
counselled
often
ask
of
the
god
an
answer
to
our
question
ask
of
apollo
here
in
branch
i
d√¶
pactyes
the
lydian
flying
from
the
persian
has
sought
in
cym√©
refuge
and
protection
the
persian
bids
us
yield
our
hearts
bid
shield
him
what
does
apollo
bid
his
servants
do
the
oracle
replied
and
straight
returning
to
cym√©
ran
the
messengers
brought
to
the
citizens
the
answer
apollo
bids
you
yield
to
persia
will
so
when
the
men
of
cym√©
heard
the
answer
they
set
in
hand
at
once
to
yield
their
suppliant
but
aristodicus
loved
of
the
city
withstood
their
will
and
thus
to
them
spake
he
your
messengers
have
lied
they
have
made
merry
in
their
own
homes
they
have
not
sought
apollo
the
god
in
branch
i
d√¶
had
never
counselled
that
we
should
yield
our
suppliant
to
the
foe
wait
i
myself
with
others
of
your
choosing
will
seek
the
god
and
bring
you
back
his
answer
would
not
yield
the
man
who
trusted
cym√©
what
is
the
god
of
baser
stuff
than
i
so
by
the
bright
bay
under
the
blue
heavens
a
second
time
to
branch
i
d√¶
they
journeyed
a
second
time
beneath
the
purple
shadows
passed
through
the
laurels
to
apollo
fane
then
aristodicus
spake
thus
to
cym√©
comes
pactyes
fleeing
from
the
wrath
of
persia
and
she
demands
him
but
we
dare
not
yield
him
until
we
know
what
thou
wouldst
have
us
do
our
arm
is
weak
against
the
power
of
persia
the
foe
is
strong
and
our
defences
slender
yet
lord
not
yet
have
we
been
bold
to
render
him
who
has
come
a
suppliant
to
our
gates
so
the
cym√©an
spake
apollo
answered
yield
ye
your
suppliant
yield
him
to
the
persians
then
aristodicus
bethought
him
further
and
in
this
fashion
craftily
he
wrought
all
round
the
temple
in
the
nooks
and
crannies
of
carven
work
made
by
man
love
and
labour
in
perfect
safety
by
apollo
guarded
the
swallows
and
the
sparrows
built
their
nests
and
all
day
long
their
floating
wings
made
beauty
about
the
temple
and
the
whispering
laurels
and
their
shrill
notes
with
the
sea
ceaseless
murmur
rose
in
sweet
chorus
to
the
great
god
ears
now
round
the
temple
went
the
men
of
cym√©
tore
down
the
nests
and
snared
the
building
swallows
and
a
wild
wind
went
moaning
through
the
branches
the
sunlight
died
and
all
the
sky
grew
gray
men
shivered
in
the
disenchanted
noontide
and
overhead
the
gray
sky
darkened
darkened
and
in
the
heart
of
every
man
beholding
the
anger
of
the
immortal
gods
made
night
then
from
the
hid
shrine
of
the
inner
temple
came
forth
a
voice
more
beautiful
than
music
more
terrible
than
thunder
and
wild
waters
and
more
to
be
desired
than
summer
sun
o
thou
most
impious
of
all
impious
mortals
why
hast
thou
dared
defy
me
in
my
temple
and
torn
away
the
homes
of
those
who
trust
me
taken
my
suppliants
from
me
for
thy
prey
then
aristodicus
stood
forth
and
answered
lord
is
it
thus
suppliants
are
succoured
what
time
thy
oracle
bids
men
of
cym√©
to
yield
their
suppliant
to
the
persian
spears
then
on
the
hush
of
awful
expectation
following
the
challenge
of
the
mortals
broke
the
god
voice
unspeakably
melodious
with
all
the
song
and
sorrow
of
the
world
yea
i
do
bid
you
yield
him
that
so
sinning
against
the
gods
ye
may
the
sooner
perish
and
come
no
more
to
question
at
my
temple
of
yielding
suppliants
who
have
trusted
you
at
the
private
view
yes
that
my
picture
great
you
say
the
crowd
says
it
will
make
my
name
a
name
i
gladly
throw
away
for
a
certain
unseen
star
pure
ray
i
want
success
i
missed
not
fame
you
see
the
mother
kneeling
there
the
child
who
cries
for
bread
in
vain
the
hard
straw
bed
the
window
bare
the
rags
the
rat
the
broken
chair
the
misery
and
cold
and
pain
but
what
you
do
see
never
will
is
what
was
there
while
yet
i
drew
the
lines
which
are
not
drawn
so
ill
put
on
the
colours
worthy
still
of
praise
from
critics
such
as
you
i
used
to
paint
all
day
to
pour
my
soul
out
as
i
painted
see
there
to
the
life
the
rotten
floor
the
rags
the
damp
the
broken
door
for
those
your
world
will
honour
me
but
though
if
here
my
models
were
you
should
not
find
a
line
drawn
wrong
yet
there
is
food
for
my
despair
but
half
my
picture
finished
fair
words
without
music
are
not
song
sometimes
i
almost
caught
the
tune
then
changing
lights
across
the
sky
turned
gray
morn
to
red
afternoon
i
had
to
drop
my
brush
too
soon
lay
the
transfigured
by
that
woman
did
not
kneel
on
there
when
once
my
back
was
turned
i
know
she
used
to
leave
the
broken
chair
and
show
her
face
and
its
despair
oh
if
i
could
have
seen
her
so
about
her
neck
clung
close
close
to
her
heart
the
crept
my
room
could
tell
you
if
it
chose
there
was
a
picture
then
god
knows
and
i
who
might
have
painted
slept
then
when
birds
bade
the
world
prepare
for
dawn
ere
yet
the
east
grew
wan
she
stepped
back
to
the
canvas
there
wearing
the
look
she
will
not
wear
when
eyes
like
yours
and
mine
look
on
and
when
the
mother
kneeled
once
more
while
birds
grew
shrill
and
shadows
faint
the
child
white
face
the
one
look
bore
which
to
my
eyes
it
never
wore
which
i
would
give
my
soul
to
paint
hung
as
you
see
upon
the
line
but
when
i
laid
the
varnish
on
and
left
my
two
fate
laughed
malign
farewell
to
that
last
hope
of
thine
thy
chance
of
painting
them
is
gone
a
dirge
in
gray
larranagas
thank
you
thank
you
not
a
knife
i
never
use
one
i
the
right
thing
on
my
which
some
fool
or
other
gave
me
takes
the
end
off
in
a
second
sharp
as
life
bites
off
our
pleasures
see
the
soft
wreath
upward
curling
gray
as
mists
in
hollows
blue
as
skies
in
mild
october
vague
elusive
as
delight
is
ah
what
shapes
the
grow
to
when
they
looked
at
by
a
dreamer
waves
that
moan
cold
gray
and
curling
on
a
shore
where
gray
rocks
break
them
skies
where
gray
and
blue
are
blended
as
our
life
blends
joy
and
sorrow
angel
wings
and
smoke
of
battles
lines
of
beauty
curved
perfection
eyes
see
many
marvels
gazed
at
through
one
lashes
wreaths
of
smoke
take
shapes
uncanny
beckoning
hands
and
warning
fingers
but
the
gray
cloud
always
somehow
ends
by
looking
like
a
woman
like
a
woman
tall
and
slender
gowned
in
gray
with
eyes
like
twilight
soft
and
dreamy
and
delicious
through
my
eyes
i
see
her
through
my
life
am
conscious
of
her
pure
perpetual
presence
then
the
gray
wreaths
spread
out
broadly
till
they
make
a
level
landscape
toneless
dull
and
very
rainy
and
an
open
grave
i
saw
it
through
the
rain
i
heard
the
falling
of
the
tears
the
heart
sheds
inly
oh
i
saw
it
i
remember
leafless
branches
dripping
dripping
through
a
chill
not
born
of
autumn
to
that
grave
tends
all
my
dreaming
oh
i
saw
it
i
remember
by
that
grave
all
dreaming
ended
the
woman
world
oh
to
be
alone
to
escape
from
the
work
the
play
the
talking
everyday
to
escape
from
all
i
have
done
and
all
that
remains
to
do
to
escape
yes
even
from
you
my
only
love
and
be
alone
and
free
could
i
only
stand
between
gray
moor
and
gray
sky
where
the
winds
and
the
plovers
cry
and
no
man
is
at
hand
and
feel
the
free
wind
blow
on
my
face
and
know
i
am
free
not
yours
but
my
own
free
and
alone
for
the
soft
and
the
home
of
your
heart
my
dear
they
hurt
being
always
here
i
want
to
stand
up
upright
and
to
cool
my
eyes
in
the
air
and
to
see
how
my
back
can
bear
burdens
to
try
to
know
to
learn
to
grow
i
am
only
you
i
am
yours
part
of
you
your
wife
and
i
have
no
other
life
i
can
not
think
can
not
do
i
can
not
breathe
can
not
see
there
is
us
but
there
is
not
me
and
worst
at
your
kiss
i
grow
contented
so
the
lighthouse
above
the
rocks
above
the
waves
shines
the
strong
light
that
warns
and
saves
so
you
too
high
for
storm
or
strife
light
up
the
shipwreck
of
my
life
the
lighthouse
warns
the
wise
but
these
not
only
sail
the
stormy
seas
towards
the
light
the
foolish
steer
and
drowning
read
its
meaning
dear
and
if
the
lamp
by
chance
allure
some
foolish
ship
to
death
be
sure
the
lamp
will
to
itself
protest
his
be
the
blame
i
did
my
best
to
a
young
poet
tired
of
work
then
drop
away
from
the
land
of
cheerful
day
pen
the
muse
and
drive
the
pen
if
you
stay
with
living
men
fancy
fails
then
pluck
from
those
gardens
where
her
blossom
blows
trim
the
buds
and
wire
them
well
and
your
bouquet
sure
to
sell
write
write
write
produce
produce
write
for
sale
and
not
for
use
this
is
a
commercial
age
write
and
fill
your
ledger
page
if
your
soul
should
droop
and
die
bury
it
with
undimmed
eye
never
mind
what
memory
says
soul
a
thing
that
never
pays
the
temptation
let
me
go
i
can
not
be
all
you
think
me
pure
and
true
those
brave
crown
you
they
were
trampled
down
by
me
horrid
ghosts
rise
up
between
you
and
me
i
dare
not
pass
what
might
be
is
dead
what
was
is
its
poison
o
my
queen
i
should
wither
up
your
life
blacken
blight
its
maiden
flower
you
would
live
to
curse
the
hour
when
you
made
yourself
my
wife
yet
your
hand
held
out
your
eyes
pleading
longing
brimmed
with
tears
i
have
lived
in
hell
for
years
do
not
show
me
paradise
lest
i

then
take

if

worse

the
ballad
of
sir
hugh
the
castle
had
been
held
in
siege
while
thrice
three
weeks
went
past
and
still
the
foe
no
vantage
gained
and
still
our
men
stood
fast
we
held
the
castle
for
our
king
against
our
foes
and
his
stout
was
our
heart
as
man
must
be
in
such
brave
cause
as
this
but
sir
hugh
walked
the
castle
wall
and
oh
his
heart
was
sore
for
the
foe
held
fast
the
only
son
his
dead
wife
ever
bore
the
castle
gates
were
firm
and
fast
strong
was
the
castle
wall
yet
bore
sir
hugh
an
aching
heart
for
the
thing
that
might
befal
he
looked
out
to
the
pearly
east
ere
day
began
to
break
god
save
my
boy
till
evensong
he
said
for
mary
sake
he
looked
out
on
the
western
sky
when
the
sun
sank
god
keep
my
son
till
morning
light
for
his
son
sake
he
said
and
morn
and
eve
and
noon
and
night
his
heart
one
prayer
did
make
god
keep
my
boy
my
little
one
for
his
dear
dead
mother
sake
at
last
worn
out
with
bootless
siege
our
walls
being
tall
and
stout
the
rebel
captain
neared
our
gates
with
a
flag
of
truce
held
out
a
word
sir
hugh
a
word
with
you
ere
yet
it
be
too
late
we
have
a
prisoner
and
would
know
what
is
to
be
his
fate
yield
up
your
castle
or
he
dies
is
thus
the
bargain
stands
his
body
in
our
hands
we
hold
his
life
is
in
your
hands
sir
hugh
looked
down
across
the
moat
and
in
the
sunlight
fair
he
saw
the
child
blue
frightened
eyes
and
tangled
golden
hair
he
saw
the
little
arms
held
out
the
little
voice
rang
thin
o
father
dear
undo
the
gates
o
father
let
me
in
sir
hugh
leaned
on
the
battlements
his
voice
rang
strong
and
true
my
son
i
can
not
let
thee
in
as
my
heart
bids
me
do
if
i
should
open
and
let
thee
in
i
let
in
with
thee
shame
and
that
thing
never
shall
be
done
by
one
who
bears
our
name
for
honour
and
our
king
command
and
we
must
needs
obey
so
bear
thee
as
a
brave
man
son
as
i
will
do
this
day
the
boy
looked
up
his
shoulders
squared
threw
back
his
bright
blond
hair
father
i
will
not
be
the
one
to
shame
the
name
we
bear
and
whatsoever
they
may
do
whether
i
live
or
die
i
bear
me
as
a
brave
man
son
for
that
thank
god
am
i
then
spake
sir
hugh
unto
the
foe
he
spake
full
fierce
and
free
ye
cowards
deem
ye
ye
have
affair
with
cowards
such
as
ye
be
what
i
must
yield
my
castle
up
or
else
my
son
be
slain
i
trow
ye
never
had
to
do
till
now
with
honest
men
is
but
by
traitors
such
as
you
that
such
foul
deeds
be
done
not
to
betray
his
king
and
cause
did
i
beget
my
son
my
son
was
bred
to
wield
the
sword
and
hew
down
knaves
like
you
or
at
the
least
die
like
a
man
as
he
this
day
shall
do
and
since
ye
lack
a
weapon
meet
to
take
so
good
a
life
for
your
coward
steel
would
stain
his
blood
here
take
his
father
knife
with
that
he
flung
the
long
knife
down
from
off
the
castle
wall
it
glimmered
and
gleamed
in
the
brave
sunlight
full
in
the
sight
of
all
sir
hugh
passed
down
the
turret
stair
we
held
our
breath
in
awe
may
my
tongue
wither
ere
it
tell
the
damn√®d
work
we
saw
when
all
was
done
a
shout
went
up
from
that
accurs√®d
crew
and
from
the
chapel
silence
dim
came
forth
in
haste
sir
hugh
and
what
may
mean
this
clamour
and
din
sir
hugh
thy
son
is
dead
i
deemed
the
foe
had
entered
in
but
god
is
good
he
said
we
stood
upon
the
topmost
tower
full
in
the
setting
sun
shamed
silence
grew
in
the
traitor
camp
now
that
foul
deed
was
done
see
on
the
hills
the
gleam
of
steel
hark
threatening
clarions
ring
see
horse
and
foot
and
spear
and
shield
and
the
banner
of
the
king
and
in
the
camp
of
those
without
hot
tumult
and
cold
fear
for
the
traitor
only
dares
be
brave
until
his
king
be
near
we
armed
at
speed
we
sallied
forth
sir
hugh
was
at
our
head
he
set
his
teeth
and
he
marked
his
path
by
a
line
of
traitors
dead
he
hacked
his
way
straight
to
the
churl
who
did
the
boy
to
death
he
swung
his
sword
in
his
two
strong
hands
and
clove
him
to
the
teeth
and
while
the
blade
was
held
in
the
bone
the
caitiffs
round
him
pressed
and
he
died
as
one
of
his
line
should
die
with
three
blades
in
his
breast
and
when
they
told
the
king
these
things
he
turned
his
head
away
and
said
a
braver
man
than
i
has
fallen
for
me
this
day
february
the
spring
in
the
air
here
there
everywhere
though
there
scarce
a
green
tip
to
a
bud
spring
laughs
over
hill
and
plain
as
the
sunlight
turns
the
lane
mud
to
a
splendour
of
copper
one
way
of
silver
the
other
and
longings
one
can
not
smother
and
delight
that
sings
through
the
brain
turn
all
one
life
into
glory
is
the
old
new
ravishing
story
the
spring
here
again
when
the
leaves
grew
red
and
dead
we
said
see
how
much
more
fair
than
the
green
leaves
shimmering
are
the
mists
and
the
tints
of
decay
in
the
dainty
dreamings
that
lighted
the
gray
november
did
our
hearts
not
remember
the
green
woods
and
linnets
that
sing
ah
we
knew
spring
was
lost
and
pretended
was
autumn
we
loved
lies
are
ended
thank
god
for
the
spring
april
who
calls
the
autumn
season
drear
it
was
in
autumn
that
we
met
when
under
foot
dead
leaves
lay
wet
in
the
black
london
gardens
dear
the
fog
was
yellow
everywhere
and
very
thick
in
finsbury
square
where
in
those
days
we
used
to
meet
i
used
to
buy
you
violets
sweet
from
down
by
moorgate
street
was
autumn
then
can
we
forget
when
first
we
met
who
says
that
spring
is
dear
and
fair
it
is
in
that
we
part
and
weary
heart
from
weary
heart
turns
as
the
birds
begin
to
pair
the
sun
shines
on
the
golden
dome
the
primroses
in
baskets
come
with
daffodils
in
sheaves
to
cheer
the
town
with
dreams
of
the
crown√®d
year
we
both
polite
and
insincere
though
neither
says
it
yet
at
heart
we
mean
to
part
june
oh
i
weary
of
the
town
where
life
too
hard
for
smiling
and
the
dreary
houses
frown
and
the
very
sun
seems
cruel
in
its
glory
as
it
beats
upon
the
miles
of
dusty
roofs
the
dreary
squares
and
streets
this
sun
that
gilds
the
great
paul
the
golden
cross
and
dome
is
this
the
same
that
shines
upon
our
little
church
at
home
our
little
church
is
gray
it
stands
upon
a
you
can
see
it
miles
away
the
rooks
sail
round
its
tower
and
the
plovers
from
the
moor
i
used
to
see
the
daisies
through
the
framing
door
when
all
the
wood
and
meadow
with
june
sunshine
were
ablaze
then
the
sun
had
ways
of
shining
that
it
has
nowadays
there
are
elm
trees
all
around
where
the
birds
and
bees
in
summer
make
a
murmuring
and
on
the
quiet
pastures
the
sound
afar
and
you
hear
the
low
of
cattle
where
the
red
farm
buildings
are
oh
on
that
grass
to
rest
my
head
and
hear
that
old
sweet
tune
and
forget
the
cruel
city
on
this
first
blue
day
of
june
the
grass
is
high
i
know
and
the
wind
across
the
meadow
is
the
same
that
used
to
blow
but
if
my
steps
turned
thither
on
this
golden
first
june
day
it
would
only
be
to
count
my
dead
whom
god
has
taken
away
that
graveyard
where
the
daisies
grow
not
yet
my
heart
can
bear
to
pass
that
way
but
oh
some
day
some
kind
hand
lay
me
there
july
the
night
hardly
covers
the
face
of
the
sky
but
the
darkness
is
drawn
like
a
veil
the
heaven
these
nights
in
july
a
veil
rent
at
dawn
when
with
exquisite
tremors
the
poplar
leaves
quiver
and
a
breeze
like
a
kiss
wakes
the
slumbering
river
and
the
light
in
the
east
keener
grows
clearer
grows
till
the
edge
of
the
clouds
turn
from
pearl
into
rose
and
the
hill
shoulder
the
night
wholly
past
the
sun
peeps
at
last
come
out
there
a
freshness
that
thrills
like
a
song
that
soothes
like
a
sleep
and
the
scent
of
wild
thyme
on
the
air
borne
along
where
the
downs
slope
up
steep
there
such
dew
on
the
earth
and
such
lights
in
the
heaven
lost
joys
are
forgotten
old
sorrows
forgiven
and
the
old
earth
looks
new
and
our
hearts
seem
and
stripped
of
the
which
long
they
have
worn
and
hope
and
brave
purpose
awaken
anew
the
sunshine
and
dew
november
low
lines
of
leaden
clouds
sweep
by
across
the
gold
sun
and
blue
sky
which
still
are
there
eternally
above
the
sodden
droop
empty
dry
and
dead
where
the
tall
lily
bent
its
head
over
carnations
white
and
red
the
leafless
poplars
straight
and
tall
stand
by
the
garden
wall
from
which
such
rare
fruit
used
to
fall
in
the
verandah
where
of
old
sweet
august
spent
the
roses
gold
round
the
chill
pillars
shivering
fold
garlands
of
sharp
with
cold
and
we
by
cosy
fireside
muse
on
what
the
fates
grant
what
refuse
and
what
we
waste
and
what
we
use
summer
returns
despite
the
rain
that
weeps
against
the
who
weep
fame
and
golden
gain
for
youth
that
does
not
come
again
rochester
castle
blue
sky
gray
arches
and
white
white
cloud
gray
eyes
white
hands
and
a
free
white
crowd
of
wheeling
whirling
fluttering
things
pink
feet
bright
feathers
and
wide
warm
wings
thousands
of
pigeons
all
the
year
fly
in
and
out
of
the
arches
here
what
prisoned
hands
have
torn
at
the
stone
where
your
soft
hand
lies
oh
my
heart
alone
what
prisoned
eyes
have
grown
blind
with
tears
to
see
what
we
see
after
all
these
years
the
free
broad
river
go
smoothly
by
and
the
free
blithe
birds
the
free
blue
sky
and
now
o
time
how
you
work
your
will
the
pitiless
walls
are
standing
still
but
the
blossom
on
every
ledge
and
the
wild
rose
garlands
the
walls
sheer
edge
and
where
once
the
imprisoned
heart
beat
low
the
beautiful
pigeons
fly
to
and
fro
in
the
sad
stern
arches
they
build
and
pair
as
happy
as
dreams
and
as
free
as
air
and
sorrow
and
longing
and
pain
man
brings
not
into
these
walls
again
and
yet
o
my
love
with
the
face
of
flowers
what
do
we
bring
in
these
hearts
of
ours
ruckinge
church
and
we
said
how
dreary
and
desolate
and
forlorn
the
church
was
and
how
long
it
was
since
any
music
but
that
of
the
harmonium
and
the
heartless
mixed
choir
had
sounded
there
and
we
said
old
church
it
will
never
hear
any
true
music
any
more
then
she
turned
to
us
from
the
door
of
the
lady
chapel
which
was
plastered
and
whitewashed
and
had
a
stove
and
the
evangelical
almanac
in
it
and
her
eyes
were
full
of
tears
and
standing
there
she
sang
maria
it
was
gounod
music
i
think
with
her
voice
and
her
face
like
an
angel
and
while
she
sang
a
stranger
came
to
the
church
door
and
stood
listening
but
he
did
not
see
us
only
we
saw
that
he
loved
her
singing
and
he
went
away
as
soon
as
the
hymn
was
ended
we
also
soon
following
and
the
church
was
left
lonely
as
before
from
our
the
boat
crept
slowly
through
the
that
greenly
cover
all
the
waterways
between
high
banks
where
ranks
of
sedge
and
reeds
sigh
one
sad
secret
all
their
quiet
days
through
grasses
and
rushes
green
and
flags
and
strange
wet
blossoms
only
seen
where
man
so
seldom
comes
so
briefly
stays
from
the
high
bank
the
sheep
looked
calmly
down
unscared
to
see
my
boat
and
me
go
by
the
elm
trees
showed
their
dress
of
golden
brown
to
winds
that
should
disrobe
them
presently
and
a
marsh
sunset
flamed
across
the
wold
and
the
still
water
caught
the
lavished
gold
the
primrose
and
the
purple
of
the
sky
the
boat
pressed
ever
through
the
weeds
and
sedge
which
rustling
clung
her
steadfast
prow
around
the
iris
nodded
at
the
water
edge
bats
in
the
elm
trees
made
a
ghostly
sound
with
whirring
wings
a
wild
duck
sprang
to
sight
and
flew
towards
the
crimson
light
leaving
my
solitude
the
more
profound
we
moved
towards
the
church
my
boat
and
i
the
church
that
at
the
marsh
edge
stands
alone
it
caught
the
reflex
of
the
sunset
sky
on
roof
and
stone
through
snow
and
shower
and
sunshine
it
had
stood
in
the
thronged
graveyard
infinite
solitude
while
many
a
year
had
come
and
flowered
and
gone
from
the
to
the
field
of
graves
but
just
a
step
across
a
lichened
wall
thick
the
happy
dead
the
marsh
grass
waves
and
cloudy
wreaths
of
marsh
mist
gather
and
fall
and
the
marsh
sunsets
shed
their
gold
and
red
over
still
hearts
that
once
in
torment
fed
at
life
intolerable
festival
the
plaster
of
the
porch
has
fallen
away
from
the
lean
stones
that
now
are
all
awry
and
through
the
chinks
a
shooting
ivy
spray
creeps
in
sad
emblem
of
fidelity
and
wreathes
with
life
the
pillars
and
the
beams
hewn
long
ago
with
ah
what
faith
and
dreams
by
men
whose
faith
and
dreams
have
long
gone
by
the
rusty
key
the
heavy
rotten
door
the
dead
unhappy
air
the
pillars
green
with
mould
and
damp
the
desecrated
floor
with
bricks
and
boards
where
tombstones
should
have
been
and
were
once
all
the
musty
dreary
chill
they
strike
a
shudder
through
my
being
still
when
memory
lights
again
that
lightless
scene
and
where
the
altar
stood
and
where
the
christ
reached
out
his
arms
to
all
the
world
there
stood
as
if
love
had
not
sufficed
to
all
the
world
has
ever
known
of
good
our
lady
chapel
was
a
lightless
shrine
there
was
no
human
heart
and
no
divine
no
odour
of
prayer
no
altar
and
no
rood
there
was
no
scent
of
incense
in
the
air
no
sense
of
all
the
past
breathed
through
the
aisle
the
white
glass
windows
turned
to
mocking
glare
the
lovely
sunset
gracious
rosy
smile
a
vault
a
tomb
wherein
was
laid
to
sleep
all
that
a
man
might
give
his
life
to
keep
if
only
for
an
instant
breathing
while
cold
with
my
rage
against
the
men
who
held
at
such
cheap
rate
the
labours
of
the
dead
my
heart
within
me
sank
while
it
swelled
a
sadness
that
would
not
be
comforted
an
awe
came
on
me
and
i
seemed
to
face
the
invisible
spirit
of
the
dreary
place
to
hear
the
unheard
voice
of
it
which
said
is
love
then
dead
upon
earth
ah
who
shall
tell
or
be
told
what
my
walls
were
once
worth
when
men
worked
for
love
not
for
gold
each
stone
was
made
to
hold
a
heartful
of
love
and
faith
now
love
and
faith
are
dead
dead
are
the
prayers
that
are
said
nothing
is
living
but
death
oh
for
the
old
glad
days
incense
thick
in
the
air
passion
of
thanks
and
of
praise
passion
of
trust
and
of
prayer
ah
the
old
days
were
fair
love
on
the
earth
was
then
strong
were
men
souls
and
brave
those
men
lie
in
the
grave
they
will
live
not
again
then
all
my
arches
rang
with
music
glorious
and
sweet
men
souls
burned
as
they
sang
tears
fell
down
at
their
feet
hearts
with
the
beat
hands
in
men
hands
held
fast
union
and
brotherhood
were
ah
the
old
days
were
fair
therefore
the
old
days
passed
then
when
later
there
came
hatred
anger
and
strife
the
sword
and
the
flame
and
the
stake
and
contempt
of
life
husband
severed
from
wife
hearts
with
the
bled
through
the
worst
of
the
fight
still
the
old
fire
burned
bright
still
the
old
faith
was
not
dead
though
they
tore
my
christ
from
the
cross
and
mocked
at
the
mother
of
grace
and
broke
my
windows
across
defiling
the
holy
place
children
of
death
and
disgrace
they
spat
on
the
altar
stone
they
tore
down
and
trampled
the
rood
stained
my
pillars
with
blood
left
me
lifeless
alone
yet
when
my
walls
were
left
robbed
of
all
beauty
and
bare
still
god
cancelled
the
theft
the
soul
of
the
thing
was
there
in
my
damp
unwindowed
air
fugitives
stopped
to
pray
and
their
prayers
were
splendid
to
hear
like
the
sound
of
a
storm
that
is
near
and
love
was
not
dead
that
day
then
the
birds
of
the
air
built
nests
in
these
empty
shadows
of
mine
and
the
warmth
of
their
brooding
breasts
still
warmed
the
untended
shrine
his
creatures
are
all
divine
he
is
praised
by
the
woodland
throng
and
my
old
walls
echoed
and
heard
the
passionate
praising
word
and
love
still
lived
in
their
song
then
came
the
protestant
crew
and
made
me
the
thing
you
have
known
whitewashed
and
plastered
me
new
covered
my
marble
and
stone
could
they
not
leave
me
alone
vain
was
the
cry
for
they
trod
over
my
tombs
and
i
saw
books
and
the
tables
of
law
set
in
the
place
of
my
god
and
love
is
dead
so
it
seems
shall
i
never
hear
again
the
music
of
heaven
and
of
dreams
songs
of
ideals
of
men
great
dreams
and
songs
we
had
then
now
i
but
hear
from
the
wood
cry
of
a
bat
or
a
bird
oh
for
love
passionate
word
sent
from
men
hearts
to
the
good
sometimes
men
come
and
they
sing
but
i
know
not
their
song
nor
their
voice
they
have
no
hearts
they
can
bring
they
have
no
souls
to
rejoice
theirs
is
but
folly
and
noise
oh
for
a
voice
that
could
sing
songs
to
the
queen
of
the
blest
hymns
to
the
dearest
and
best
songs
to
our
master
her
king
the
church
was
full
of
silence
i
shut
in
its
loss
and
loneliness
and
went
my
way
its
sadness
was
not
less
its
walls
within
because
i
wore
it
in
my
heart
that
day
and
many
a
day
since
when
i
see
again
marsh
sunsets
and
across
the
golden
plain
the
church
golden
roof
and
arches
gray
along
wet
roads
all
shining
with
late
rain
and
through
wet
woods
all
dripping
brown
and
sere
i
came
one
day
towards
the
church
again
it
was
the
of
the
day
and
year
the
sky
was
light
and
bright
and
flecked
with
cloud
that
changeful
through
bright
rents
allowed
sun
and
blue
sky
to
smile
and
disappear
the
sky
behind
the
old
gray
church
was
gray
gray
as
my
memories
and
gray
as
i
the
forlorn
graves
each
side
the
grassy
way
called
to
me
brother
as
i
passed
them
by
the
door
was
open
i
shall
feel
again
i
thought
that
inextinguishable
pain
of
longing
loss
and
hopeless
memory
when
o
electric
flash
of
ecstasy
no
spirit
moan
of
pain
fell
on
my
ear
a
human
voice
an
angel
melody
god
let
me
in
that
perfect
moment
hear
oh
the
sweet
rush
of
gladness
and
delight
of
human
striving
to
the
heavenly
light
of
great
ideals
permanent
and
dear
all
the
old
dreams
linked
with
the
newer
faith
all
the
old
faith
with
higher
dreams
enwound
surged
through
the
very
heart
of
loss
and
death
in
passionate
waves
of
pure
and
perfect
sound
the
past
came
back
the
christ
the
the
incense
of
the
hearts
that
praised
and
prayed
the
past
peace
and
the
future
faith

and
all
the
soul
of
all
the
past
was
here
a
human
heart
that
loved
the
great
and
good
a
heart
to
which
the
great
ideals
were
dear
one
that
had
heard
and
that
had
understood
as
i
had
done
the
church
desolate
moan
and
answered
it
as
i
had
never
done
and
never
willed
to
do
and
never
could
i
left
the
church
glad
to
the
soul
and
strong
and
passed
along
by
fresh
ways
safe
in
my
heart
the
echo
of
that
song
lived
as
it
will
live
with
me
all
my
days
the
church
will
never
lose
that
echo
nor
be
quite
as
lonely
ever
any
more
nor
will
my
soul
where
too
that
echo
stays
rye
a
little
town
that
stands
upon
a
hill
against
whose
base
the
white
waves
once
leaped
high
now
spreading
round
it
even
green
and
still
the
placid
pastures
of
the
marshes
lie
the
houses
and
the
gray
church
tower
bear
half
asleep
the
sunshine
and
the
rain
they
wait
so
long
have
waited
for
the
hour
when
the
wild
welcome
sea
shall
come
again
the
lovely
lights
across
the
marshes
pass
the
dykes
grow
fair
with
blossom
reed
and
sedge
the
patient
beasts
crop
the
long
cool
green
grass
the
willows
shiver
at
the
water
edge
but
the
town
sleeps
it
will
not
wake
for
these
the
sea
some
day
again
will
round
it
break
will
surge
across
these
leagues
of
pastoral
peace
and
then
the
little
town
will
laugh
and
wake
the
ballad
of
the
two
spells
why
dost
thou
weep
the
mass
priest
said
fair
dame
why
dost
thou
weep
i
weep
because
my
lord
is
laid
in
an
enchanted
sleep
it
was
upon
our
bridal
day
the
bitter
thing
befel
my
love
and
lord
was
lured
away
by
an
ill
witch
spell
she
lured
him
to
her
hidden
bower
among
the
cypress
trees
and
there
she
holdeth
manhood
flower
asleep
across
her
knees
pray
to
our
father
for
his
aid
god
knows
ye
need
it
sore
o
god
of
heaven
have
i
not
prayed
but
i
will
pray
no
more
god
will
not
listen
to
my
prayer
and
never
a
saint
will
hear
else
should
i
stand
beside
him
there
or
he
be
with
me
here
but
there
he
sleeps
and
i
wake
here
and
wet
my
bread
with
tears
and
still
they
say
that
god
can
hear
and
still
god
never
hears
if
i
could
learn
a
mighty
spell
would
get
my
love
awake
i
sell
my
soul
alive
to
hell
and
learn
it
for
his
sake
so
say
thy
mass
and
go
thy
way
and
let
my
grief
alone
teach
thou
the
happy
how
to
pray
and
leave
the
devil
his
own
within
the
witch
secret
bower
through
changeful
day
and
night
hour
after
priceless
golden
hour
lay
the
enchanted
knight
the
witch
arms
about
him
lay
his
face
slept
in
her
hair
the
devil
taught
her
the
spell
to
say
because
she
was
so
fair
and
all
about
the
bower
were
flowers
and
gems
and
golden
gear
and
still
she
watched
the
hours
because
he
was
so
dear
watched
in
her
tower
among
the
trees
for
his
long
sleep
to
break
and
still
he
lay
across
her
knees
and
still
he
did
not
wake
what
whisper
stirs
the
curtain
fold
what
foot
comes
up
the
stair
what
hand
draws
back
the
cloth
of
gold
and
leaves
the
portal
bare
the
night
wind
sweeps
through
all
the
room
the
tapers
fleer
and
flare
and
from
the
portal
outer
gloom
his
true
love
enters
there
give
place
thou
wicked
witch
give
place
for
his
true
wife
is
here
who
for
his
sake
has
lost
heaven
grace
because
he
was
so
dear
my
soul
is
lost
and
his
is
won
thy
spells
his
sleep
did
make
but
i
know
thy
spell
the
only
one
can
get
my
lord
awake
the
witch
looked
up
her
shining
eyes
gleamed
through
her
yellow
hair
she
was
cast
out
of
paradise
because
she
was
so
fair
speak
out
the
spell
thou
loving
wife
and
what
it
beareth
bide
go
bring
thy
lover
back
to
life
and
give
thy
lord
a
bride
the
wife
soul
burned
in
every
word
as
low
she
spoke
the
spell
weeping
in
heaven
her
angel
heard
one
hearing
laughed
in
hell
and
when
the
spell
was
spoken
through
sudden
the
knight
awoke
and
turned
his
eyes
upon
the
two
and
neither
of
them
spoke
he
did
not
see
his
wife
whom
sorrow
had
made
wise
he
only
saw
the
light
of
life
burn
in
the
witch
eyes
he
only
saw
her
bosom
sweet
her
golden
fleece
of
hair
and
he
fell
down
before
her
feet
because
she
was
so
fair
she
stooped
and
raised
him
from
the
floor
and
held
him
in
her
arms
she
said
he
would
have
waked
no
more
for
any
of
my
charms
you
only
could
pronounce
the
spell
would
set
his
spirit
free
and
you
have
sold
your
soul
to
hell
and
wakened
him
for
me
i
hold
him
now
by
my
blue
eyes
and
by
my
yellow
hair
he
never
will
miss
paradise
because
i
am
so
fair
the
wife
looked
back
looked
back
to
see
the
place
her
lord
head
on
the
witch
knee
her
gold
hair
on
his
face
i
would
my
soul
once
more
were
mine
then
god
my
prayer
would
hear
and
slay
my
soul
in
place
of
thine
because
thou
art
so
dear
in
memoriam
philip
bourke
marston
when
you
were
tired
and
went
away
i
said
amid
my
new
when
i
catch
breath
from
pain
some
day
i
will
teach
grief
a
worthier
way
and
make
a
great
song
for
his
sake
yet
there
is
silence
o
my
friend
you
gave
me
love
such
years
ago
a
child
who
could
not
comprehend
its
worth
yet
kept
it
to
the
end
how
can
i
sing
when
you
lie
low
not
always
silence
o
my
dear
not
when
the
empty
heart
and
hand
reach
out
for
you
who
are
not
near
if
you
could
see
if
you
could
hear
i
think
that
you
would
understand
the
grief
that
can
get
leave
to
run
in
channels
smooth
of
tender
song
wins
solace
mine
has
never
won
i
have
left
all
my
work
undone
and
only
dragged
my
grief
along
many
who
loved
you
many
years
not
more
than
i
shall
always
do
will
breathe
their
songs
in
your
dead
ears
god
help
them
if
they
weep
such
tears
as
i
who
have
no
song
for
you
you
would
forgive
me
if
you
knew
silence
is
all
i
have
to
bring
where
tears
are
many
words
are
few
i
have
but
tears
to
bring
to
you
for
since
you
died
i
can
not
sing
rondeau
to
austin
dobson
your
dainty
muse
her
form
arrays
in
soft
brocades
of
bygone
days
she
walks
old
gardens
where
the
dews
gem
sundials
and
yews
and
tremble
on
the
tulip
blaze
the
magic
scent
her
charm
conveys
which
lives
on
when
the
rose
decays
she
had
her
portrait
done
by
greuze
your
dainty
muse
mine
hardier
walks
life
muddy
ways
barefooted
preaches
sometimes
prays
is
modern
is
advanced
has
views
goes
in
for
lectures
reads
the
news
and
sends
her
homespun
verse
to
praise
your
dainty
muse
rondeau
to
henley
dream
and
delight
had
passed
away
their
springs
dried
by
the
dusty
day
and
sordid
fetters
bound
me
tight
forged
for
poor
song
by
i
writhed
and
could
not
get
away
there
might
have
been
no
flowering
may
in
all
the
world
life
looked
so
gray
with
dust
of
railways
choking
quite
dream
and
delight
when
lo
your
white
book
came
my
way
with
scent
of
and
hay
starshine
and
pure
and
bright
the
rose
the
may
i
owe
you
would
i
could
repay
dream
and
delight
to
walter
sickert
in
return
for
a
sight
of
his
picture
red
clover
there
is
a
country
far
away
from
here
a
world
of
dreams
a
fair
enchanted
land
where
woods
bewitched
and
fairy
forests
stand
and
all
the
seasons
rhyme
through
all
the
year
the
greenest
meadows
deepest
skies
are
there
there
grows
the
rose
of
dreams
that
never
dies
and
there
men
heads
and
hands
and
hearts
and
eyes
are
never
as
here
too
tired
to
find
them
fair
thither
when
life
becomes
too
hard
to
bear
the
poet
and
the
painter
steal
away
to
watch
those
glories
of
the
night
and
day
which
here
the
days
and
nights
so
seldom
wear
in
that
brave
land
i
too
have
part
and
lot
dim
woods
lush
meadows
little
towns
walled
flowery
gardens
wide
gray
moors
and
downs
sedge
and
wet
the
norman
church
with
whispering
elm
trees
round
a
certain
wood
where
earliest
violets
grow
one
wide
still
marsh
where
hidden
waters
flow
the
cottage
porch
with
enwound
these
are
my
portion
of
enchanted
ground
to
these
the
years
add
somewhat
in
their
flight
some
wood
or
field
in
heart
delight
becomes
my
own
treasure
to
her
who
found
to
my
dream
fields
your
art
adds
one
field
more
a
field
of
red
red
clover
blossoming
where
the
sun
shines
and
where
more
skylarks
sing
than
ever
in
any
field
of
mine
before
old
age
between
the
midnight
and
the
morn
when
wake
the
weary
heart
and
head
troops
of
gray
ghosts
from
lands
forlorn
keep
tryst
about
my
sleepless
bed
i
hear
their
cold
thin
voices
say
your
youth
is
dying
all
that
makes
up
your
life
withered
by
age
will
shrink
and
die
will
it
be
so
will
age
slay
all
the
dreams
of
love
and
hope
and
faith
put
out
the
sun
beyond
recall
and
lap
us
in
a
living
death
will
hearts
grown
old
forget
their
youth
and
hands
grown
old
give
up
the
strife
shall
we
accept
as
ordered
truth
the
dismal
anarchy
of
life
better
die
now
at
once
be
free
of
hope
and
fear
renounce
the
whole
for
of
what
worth
would
living
be
should
one
grown
old
outlive
one
soul
yet
see
through
curtains
closely
drawn
creeps
in
the
exorcising
light
the
sacred
fingers
of
the
dawn
put
all
my
troop
of
ghosts
to
flight
and
then
i
hear
the
brave
sun
voice
though
still
the
skies
are
gray
and
dim
old
age
comes
never
oh
rejoice
except
to
those
who
beckon
him
all
that
youth
dreams
are
nourished
by
by
that
shall
dreams
in
age
be
fed
thy
noble
dreams
can
