we
generally
speak
of
a

in
the
case
of
james
russell
lowell
ancestry
it
was
rather
an
ascent
through
eight
generations

a
unitarian
minister

saintly
and
discreet
he
married
miss
harriet
traill
spence
of
portsmouth
a
woman
of
superior
mind
of
great
wit
vivacity
and
an
impetuosity
that
reached
eccentricity
she
was
of
keltic
blood
of
a
family
that
came
from
the
orkneys
and
claimed
descent
from
the
sir

tripoli
by
ancestry

other
distinguished
families
lowell
was
a
good
type
of
the
new
england
gentleman
he
was
born
on
the
of
february
at
elmwood
not
far
from
brattle
street
cambridge
this
colonial
mansion
of
wood
was
built
in
by
thomas
oliver
the
last
royal
before
the
revolution
like
other
houses
in
tory
row
it
was
abandoned
by
its
owners
soon
afterwards
it
came
into
possession
of
elbridge
gerry
governor
of
massachusetts
and
fifth
of
the
united
states
whose
memory
and
name
are
kept
alive
by
the
term
it
next
became
the
property
of
lowell
about
a
year
before
the
birth
of
his
youngest
child
and
it
was
the
home
of
the
poet
until
his
death
footnote
thomas
oliver
was
graduated
from
harvard
college
in
the
class
of
he
was
a
gentleman
of
fortune
and
lived
first
in
roxbury
he
bought
the
property
on
elmwood
avenue
in
when
he
accepted
the
royal
commission
of
he
became
president
of
the
council
appointed
by
the
king
on
about
four
thousand
middlesex
freeholders
assembled
at
cambridge
and
compelled
the
mandamus
councillors
to
resign
the
president
of
the
council
urged
the
propriety
of
delay
but
the
committee
would
not
spare
him
he
was
forced
to
sign
an
agreement
as
a
man
of
honor
and
a
christian
that
he
would
never
hereafter
upon
any
terms
whatsoever
accept
a
seat
at
said
board
on
the
present
novel
and
oppressive
form
of
government
he
immediately
quitted
cambridge
and
when
the
british
troops
evacuated
boston
he
accompanied
them
by
an
odd
coincidence
he
went
to
reside
at
bristol
england
where
he
died
at
the
age
of
years
in
shortly
before
the
lowells
who
were
of
bristol
origin
took
possession
of
his
former
home

sketch
of
lowell
thomas
oliver
is
confused
with
chief
justice
peter
oliver
a
man
of
a
very
different
type
of
character
lowell
early
education
was
obtained
mainly
at
a
school
kept
nearly
opposite
elmwood
by
a
retired
publisher
an
englishman
william
wells
he
also
studied
in
the
classical
school
of
danial
ingraham
in
boston
he
was
graduated
from
harvard
college
in
the
class
of
he
is
reported
as
declaring
that
he
read
almost
everything
except
the
prescribed
by
the
faculty
lowell
says
in
one
of
his
early
poems
referring
to
harvard
tho
lightly
prized
the
ribboned
parchments
three
yet
i
am
glad
that
here
what
colleging
was
mine
i
had
he
was
secretary
of
the
hasty
pudding
society
and
one
of
the
editors
of
the
college
periodical
to
which
he
contributed
various
articles
in
prose
and
verse
his
neglect
of
prescribed
studies
and
disregard
of
college
discipline
resulted
in
his
rustication
just
before
commencement
in
he
was
sent
to
concord
where
he
resided
in
the
family
of
barzillai
frost
and
made
the
acquaintance
of
emerson
then
beginning
to
rouse
the
ire
of
conservative
unitarianism
by
his
transcendental
philosophy
of
the
brilliant
but
overestimated
margaret
fuller
who
afterwards
severely
criticised
lowell
verse
and
of
other
residents
of
the
pretty
town
he
had
been
elected
poet
of
his
class
his
removal
from
college
prevented
him
from
delivering
the
poem
which
was
afterwards
published
anonymously
for
private
distribution
it
contained
a
satire
on
abolitionists
and
reformers
i
know
the
village
he
writes
long
afterwards
in
the
person
of
hosea
biglow
esquire
i
know
the
village
though
was
sent
there
once
to
home
i
played
the
dunce
on
his
return
to
cambridge
he
took
up
the
study
of
law
and
in
received
the
degree
of
he
even
went
so
far
as
to
open
an
office
in
boston
but
it
is
a
question
whether
there
was
any
actual
basis
of
fact
in
a
whimsical
sketch
of
his
entitled
my
first
client
published
in
the
edited
by
nathan
hale
several
things
engrossed
lowell
attention
to
the
exclusion
of

attractive

that

the
famous
names
of

professor
andrews
norton
father
of
lowell
friend
and
biographer
the
saintly
henry
ware
and
others
will
occur
to
the
reader
he
was
fond
of
walking
and
knew
every
inch
of
the
beautiful
ground
then
called
sweet
auburn
now
turned
by
the
hand
of
misguided
man
into
that
most
distressing
of
monstrosities
a
modern
cemetery
he
haunted
the
poetic
shades
of
the
waverley
oaks
heard
the
charming
music
of
beaver
brook
and
climbed
the
hills
of
belmont
and
arlington
he
himself
took
his
turn
in
establishing
a
magazine
in
january
he
started
to
which
hawthorne
john
neal
miss
barrett
poe
whittier
story
parsons
and
others
contributed
and
which
in
spite
of
such
an
array
of
talent
perished
untimely
during
the
winds
of
march
he
had
already
published
in
a
little
volume
of
poems
entitled
a
year
life
they
were
marked
by
no
great
originality
betrayed
little
promise
of
future
eminence
and
margaret
fuller
who
reviewed
them
was
quite
right
in
asserting
that
neither
the
imagery
nor
the
music
of
lowell
verses
was
his
own
the
first
sonnet
in
the
present
volume
page
practically
acknowledges
the
force
of
this
criticism
the
influence
of
wordsworth
and
tennyson
may
be
distinctly
traced
in
most
of
them
but
many
of
the
lines
were
harsh
and
many
of
the
rhymes
were
careless
lowell
later
and
correcter
taste
omitted
most
of
them
from
his
collected
works
not
far
from
elmwood
but
in
the
adjoining
village
of
watertown
lived
one
of
lowell
classmates
whose
sister
maria
white
a
slender
delicate
girl
with
a
poetic
genius
in
some
respects
more
regulated
and
lofty
than
his
own
early
inspired
him
with
a
true
and
saving
love
speaking
of
the
influences
that
moulded
his
life
george
william
curtis
says
the
first
and
most
enduring
was
an
early
and
happy
passion
for
a
lovely
and
woman
who
became
his
wife
the
egeria
who
exalted
his
youth
and
confirmed
his
noblest
aspirations
a
counsellor
of
the
serener
air
who
filled
his
mind
with
peace
and
his
life
with
joy
the
young
lady
prudent
father
objected
to
the
marriage
until
the
newly
fledged
lawyer
should
be
in
a
position
to
support
a
wife
shortly
after
the
shipwreck
of
lowell
was
offered
a
hundred
dollars
by
for
ten
poems
when
pegasus
is
able
to
earn
such
princely
sums
there
seems
no
reason
why
love
should
be
kept
waiting
at
the
cottage
door
in
lowell
published
a
new
edition
of
his
poems
and
married
miss
white
it
was
her
influence
that
decided
him
to
cast
in
his
lot
with
the
abolitionists
it
was
her
refined
taste
that
shaped
and
tempered
his
impetuous
verse
a
volume
of
her
poems
was
in
in
an
edition
of
fifty
copies
privately
printed
and
is
now
very
rare
it
is
an
odd
circumstance
that
in
library
from
which
harvard
college
was
allowed
to
select
any
volumes
not
in
gore
hall
neither
this
book
nor
any
of
lowell
own
early
poems
was
to
be
found
the
young
couple
took
up
their
residence
at
elmwood
and
here
were
born
three
daughters
and
a
son
all
but
one
of
his
children
died
in
infancy
many
of
the
tenderest
of
his
poems
refer
with
touching
pathos
to
his
bereavement
such
for
instance
are
the
changeling
and
the
first
snowfall
in
appeared
the
vision
of
sir
launfal
a
genuine
inspiration
composed
in
two
days
in
a
sort
of
ecstasy
of
poetic
fervor
that
more
than
anything
established
his
fame
he
recognized
that
he
was
dedicated
to
the
muses
in
he
wrote
if
i
have
any
vocation
it
is
the
making
of
verse
when
i
take
my
pen
for
that
the
world
opens
itself
ungrudgingly
before
me
everything
seems
clear
and
easy
as
it
seems
sinking
to
the
bottom
could
be
as
one
leans
over
the
edge
of
his
boat
in
one
of
those
dear
coves
at
fresh
pond
my
true
place
is
to
serve
the
cause
as
a
poet
then
my
heart
leaps
before
me
into
the
conflict
the
same
year
he
began
his
biglow
papers
in
the
boston
such
are
apt
to
be
ephemeral
lowell
are
immortal
they
preserved
in
literary
form
a
dialect
they
caught
and
embalmed
the
mighty
issues
of
a
tremendous
their
influence
was
incalculable
he
gathered
them
into
a
volume
in
and
became
corresponding
editor
of
the
fortunate
man
who
throws
himself
into
an
unpopular
cause
which
is
in
harmony
with
the
right
how
different
from
wordsworth
who
attacked
the
ballot
and
took
sides
against
reform
lowell
penchant
for
satire
was
exemplified
again
the
same
year
in
his
fable
for
critics
in
this
lowell
with
no
sparing
hand
laid
on
his
portraits
most
droll
and
amusing
colors
it
is
a
comic
portrait
gallery
a
series
of
caricatures
whose
greatest
value
as
in
all
good
caricatures
lies
in
the
accurate
presentation
of
characteristic
features
he
did
not
spare
himself
there
is
lowell
who
striving
parnassus
to
climb
with
a
whole
bale
of
tied
together
with
rhyme
he
might
get
on
alone
spite
of
troubles
and
bowlders
but
he
ca
with
that
bundle
he
has
on
his
shoulders
the
top
of
the
hill
he
will
come
nigh
reaching
till
he
learns
the
distinctions
singing
and
preaching
his
lyre
has
some
chords
that
would
ring
pretty
well
but
he
rather
by
half
make
a
drum
of
the
shell
and
rattle
away
till
he
old
as
methusalem
at
the
head
of
a
march
to
the
last
new
jerusalem
some
of
his
thrusts
left
embittered
feelings
but
in
general
the
tone
was
so
that
only
the
could
object
and
it
must
be
confessed
many
of
his
judgments
have
been
confirmed
by
time
in
lowell
visited
europe
and
spent
upwards
of
a
year
widening
his
acquaintance
with
the
polite
languages
but
it
is
remarkable
that
lowell
gave
the
world
almost
no
metrical
translations
shortly
after
his
return
his
wife
died
after
a
slow
decline
in
reference
to
this
bereavement
longfellow
wrote
his
beautiful
poem
the
two
angels
the
following
year
longfellow
resigned
the
smith
professorship
of
the
french
and
spanish
languages
and
literature
and
belles
lettres
and
lowell
was
appointed
his
successor
with
two
years
leave
of
absence
he
had
won
his
spurs
he
had
collected
his
poems
in
two
volumes
not
including
a
year
life
the
biglow
papers
or
the
fable
for
critics
he
was
known
as
one
of
the
most
brilliant
contributors
to
and
other
magazines
in
he
delivered
a
series
of
twelve
lectures
on
english
poetry
before
the
lowell
institute
ten
years
before
he
had
published
a
volume
of
conversations
on
the
poets
the
contrast
between
the
two
works
is
no
less
pronounced
than
that
between
his
earlier
and
later
poems
in
both
however
there
is
a
tendency
toward
a
confusing
metaphors
trample
on
the
heels
of
similes
and
quaint
and
often
grotesque
conceits
sometimes
pall
upon
the
taste
just
as
in
the
poems
a
flash
of
incongruous
wit
sometimes
disturbs
the
serenity
that
is
desirable
on
his
return
from
europe
lowell
occupied
the
chair
which
he
adorned
by
his
brilliant
attainments
and
made
memorable
by
his
fame
he
lectured
on
dante
shakespeare
chaucer
and
cervantes
and
delighted
his
audiences
at
the
same
time
he
was
editor
of
the
for
several
years
from
until
he
was
associated
with
professor
charles
eliot
norton
in
the
conduct
of
the
american
in
he
married
miss
frances
dunlap
of
portland
a
cultivated
lady
who
had
been
the
governess
of
his
daughter
she
had
unerring
literary
taste
and
sound
judgment
and
lowell
soon
came
to
entrust
to
her
the
management
of
his
financial
affairs
she
was
enabled
to
make
their
comparatively
small
income
more
than
meet
the
exigencies
of
an
exacting
position
the
second
series
of
the
biglow
papers
relating
to
the
war
of
the
rebellion
were
first
published
in
the
they
were
collected
into
a
volume
in
that
year
was
rendered
notable
by
his
commemoration
ode
the
worthy
crowning
of
one
of
the
grandest
poetic
opportunities
ever
granted
to
man
under
the
willows
appeared
in
the
cathedral
in
in
he
had
issued
a
collection
of
his
early
descriptive
articles
under
the
title

in
came
among
my
books
the
second
series
followed
in
my
study
windows
was
published
in
all
these
prose
works
were
marked
by
an
exuberant
vivid
poetic
impassioned
style
the
tropical
efflorescence
of
imagery
was
characteristic
of
them

he

to
have

was
the
perfection

high
breeding

seemed
to
read
the
very
soul

station
there

not
a
shadow
to
stain
the
whiteness
of
his
fame
as
a
poet
he
stands
in
the
front
rank
of
those
who
have
yet
appeared
in
america
as
a
critic
he
was
generous
and
just
as
a
humorist

a
man

early
poems
sonnet
if
some
small
savor
creep
into
my
rhyme
of
the
old
poets
if
some
words
i
use
neglected
long
which
have
the
lusty
thews
of
that
and
time
whose
loving
joy
and
sorrow
all
sublime
have
given
our
tongue
its
starry
eminence
it
is
not
pride
god
knows
but
reverence
which
hath
grown
in
me
since
my
childhood
prime
wherein
i
feel
that
my
poor
lyre
is
strung
with
like
to
theirs
and
that
i
have
no
right
to
muse
their
holy
graves
among
if
i
can
be
a
slave
and
in
mine
own
true
spirit
am
not
brave
to

hakon
lay
then
thorstein
looked
at
hakon
where
he
sate
mute
as
a
cloud
amid
the
stormy
hall
and
said
o
skald
sing
now
an
olden
song
such
as
our
fathers
heard
who
led
great
lives
and
as
the
bravest
on
a
shield
is
borne
along
the
waving
host
that
shouts
him
king
so
rode
their
thrones
upon
the
thronging
seas
then
the
old
man
arose
he
stood
and
with
eyes
that
looked
afar
from
their
still
region
of
perpetual
snow
over
the
little
smokes
and
stirs
of
men
his
head
was
bowed
with
gathered
flakes
of
years
as
winter
bends
the
pine
but
something
triumphed
in
his
brow
and
eye
which
whoso
saw
it
could
not
see
and
crouch
loud
rang
the
emptied
beakers
as
he
mused
brooding
his
eyried
thoughts
then
as
an
eagle
circles
above
the
woods
so
wheeled
his
soul
into
the
air
of
song
high
the
stormy
hall
and
thus
he
sang
the
fletcher
for
his
picks
out
wood
straight
as
light
and
from
a
quiver
full
of
such
as
these
the
wary
matched
against
his
peers
long
doubting
singles
yet
once
more
the
best
who
is
it
that
can
make
such
shafts
as
fate
what
archer
of
his
arrows
is
so
choice
or
hits
the
white
so
surely
they
are
men
the
chosen
of
her
quiver
nor
for
her
will
every
reed
suffice
or
stick
at
random
from
life
vulgar
fagot
plucked
such
answer
household
ends
but
she
will
have
souls
straight
and
clear
of
toughest
fibre
sound
down
to
the
heart
of
heart
from
these
she
strips
all
needless
stuff
all
sapwood
hardens
them
from
circumstance
untoward
feathers
plucks
crumpled
and
cheap
and
barbs
with
iron
will
the
hour
that
passes
is
her
when
she
draws
bow
is
not
across
the
wind
nor
the
sun
her
arrow
sings
for
sun
and
wind
have
plighted
faith
to
her
ere
men
have
heard
the
sinew
twang
behold
in
the
butt
heart
her
trembling
messenger
the
song
is
old
and
simple
that
i
sing
good
were
the
days
of
yore
when
men
were
tried
by
ring
of
shields
as
now
by
ring
of
gold
but
while
the
gods
are
left
and
hearts
of
men
and
the
free
ocean
still
the
days
are
good
through
the
broad
earth
roams
opportunity
and
knocks
at
every
door
of
hut
or
hall
until
she
finds
the
brave
soul
that
she
wants
he
ceased
and
instantly
the
frothy
tide
of
interrupted
wassail
roared
along
but
leif
the
son
of
eric
sate
apart
musing
and
with
his
eyes
upon
the
fire
saw
shapes
of
arrows
lost
as
soon
as
seen
but
then
with
that
resolve
his
heart
was
bent
which
like
a
humming
shaft
through
many
a
strife
of
day
and
night
across
the
unventured
seas
shot
the
brave
prow
to
cut
on
vinland

first
rune
in
the
saga
of

out
of

be
abroad

in
their

hence
comes
the
bloom
that
hazes
round

from

and
cunningly
the
various
wind
spenser
locked
music
can
unbind
a
reverie
in
the
twilight
deep
and
silent
comes
thy
spirit
unto
mine
when
the
moonlight
and
the
starlight
over
cliff
and
woodland
shine
and
the
quiver
of
the
river
seems
a
thrill
of
joy
benign
then
i
rise
and
wander
slowly
to
the
headland
by
the
sea
when
the
evening
star
throbs
setting
through
the
cloudy
cedar
tree
and
from
under
mellow
thunder
of
the
surf
comes
fitfully
then
within
my
soul
i
feel
thee
like
a
gleam
of
other
years
visions
of
my
childhood
murmur
their
old
madness
in
my
ears
till
the
pleasance
of
thy
presence
cools
my
heart
with
blissful
tears
all
the
wondrous
dreams
of
boyhood
all
youth
fiery
thirst
of
praise
all
the
surer
hopes
of
manhood
blossoming
in
sadder
days
joys
that
bound
me
griefs
that
crowned
me
with
a
better
wreath
than
bays
all
the
longings
after
freedom
the
vague
love
of
human
kind
wandering
far
and
near
at
random
like
a
winged
seed
in
the
wind
the
dim
yearnings
and
fierce
burnings
of
an
undirected
mind
all
of
these
oh
best
belovèd
happiest
present
dreams
and
past
in
thy
love
find
safe
fulfilment
ripened
into
truths
at
last
faith
and
beauty
hope
and
duty
to
one
centre
gather
fast
how
my
nature
like
an
ocean
at
the
breath
of
thine
awakes
leaps
its
shores
in
mad
exulting
and
in
foamy
thunder
breaks
then
downsinking
lieth
shrinking
at
the
tumult
that
it
makes
blazing
hesperus
hath
sunken
low
within
the
west
and
with
golden
splendor
crowneth
the
horizon
piny
crest
thoughtful
quiet
stills
the
riot
of
wild
longing
in
my
breast
home
i
loiter
through
the
moonlight
underneath
the
quivering
trees
which
as
if
a
spirit
stirred
them
sway
and
bend
till
by
degrees
the
far
surge
murmur
merges
in
the
rustle
of
the
breeze
in
sadness
there
is
not
in
this
life
of
ours
one
bliss
unmixed
with
fears
the
hope
that
wakes
our
deepest
powers
a
face
of
sadness
wears
and
the
dew
that
showers
our
dearest
flowers
is
the
bitter
dew
of
tears
fame
waiteth
long
and
lingereth
through
weary
nights
and
morns
and
evermore
the
shadow
death
with
mocking
finger
scorns
that
underneath
the
laurel
wreath
should
be
a
wreath
of
thorns
the
laurel
leaves
are
cool
and
green
but
the
thorns
are
hot
and
sharp
lean
hunger
grins
and
stares
between
the
poet
and
his
harp
though
of
love
sunny
sheen
his
woof
have
been
grim
want
thrusts
in
the
warp
and
if
beyond
this
darksome
clime
some
fair
star
hope
may
see
that
keeps
unjarred
the
blissful
chime
of
its
golden
infancy
where
the
of
faith
sublime
not
always
is
to
be
yet
would
the
true
soul
rather
choose
its
home
where
sorrow
is
than
in
a
sated
peace
to
lose
its
life
supremest
bliss
the
rainbow
hues
that
bend
profuse
cloudy
spheres
like
this
the
want
the
sorrow
and
the
pain
that
are
love
right
to
cure
the
sunshine
bursting
after
rain
the
gladness
insecure
that
makes
us
fain
strong
hearts
to
gain
to
do
and
to
endure
high
natures
must
be
with
many
a
searing
wrong
from
mother
sorrow
breasts
the
bard
sucks
gifts
of
deepest
song
nor
all
unmarred
with
struggles
hard
wax
the
soul
sinews
strong
dear
patience
too
is
born
of
woe
patience
that
opes
the
gate
wherethrough
the
soul
of
man
must
go
up
to
each
nobler
state
whose
voice
flow
so
meek
and
low
smooths
the
bent
brows
of
fate
though
fame
be
slow
yet
death
is
swift
and
the
spirit
eyes
life
after
life
doth
change
and
shift
with
larger
destinies
as
on
we
drift
some
wider
rift
shows
us
serener
skies
and
though
naught
falleth
to
us
here
but
gains
the
world
counts
loss
though
all
we
hope
of
wisdom
clear
when
climbed
to
seems
but
dross
yet
all
though
christ
faith
they
wear
at
least
may
share
his
cross
farewell
farewell
as
the
bee
round
the
blossom
doth
murmur
drowsily
so
murmureth
round
my
bosom
the
memory
of
thee
lingering
it
seems
to
go
when
the
wind
more
full
doth
flow
waving
the
flower
to
and
fro
but
still
returneth
marian
my
hope
no
longer
burneth
which
did
so
fiercely
burn
my
joy
to
sorrow
turneth
although
loath
loath
to
turn
i
would
forget
and
yet
and
yet
my
heart
to
thee
still
yearneth
marian
fair
as
a
single
star
thou
shinest
and
white
as
lilies
are
the
slender
hands
wherewith
thou
twinest
thy
heavy
auburn
hair
thou
art
to
me
a
memory
of
all
that
is
divinest
thou
art
so
fair
and
tall
thy
looks
so
queenly
are
thy
very
shadow
on
the
wall
thy
step
upon
the
stair
the
thought
that
thou
art
nigh
the
chance
look
of
thine
eye
are
more
to
me
than
all
marian
and
will
be
till
i
die
as
the
last
quiver
of
a
bell
doth
fade
into
the
air
with
a
subsiding
swell
that
dies
we
know
not
where
so
my
hope
melted
and
was
gone
i
raised
mine
eyes
to
bless
the
star
that
shared
its
light
with
me
so
far
below
its
silver
throne
and
gloom
and
chilling
vacancy
were
all
was
left
to
me
in
the
dark
bleak
night
i
was
alone
alone
in
the
blessed
earth
marian
for
what
were
all
to
me
its
love
and
light
and
mirth
marian
if
i
were
not
with
thee
my
heart
will
not
forget
thee
more
than
the
moaning
brine
forgets
the
moon
when
she
is
set
the
gush
when
first
i
met
thee
that
thrilled
my
brain
like
wine
doth
thrill
as
madly
yet
my
heart
can
not
forget
thee
though
it
may
droop
and
pine
too
deeply
it
had
set
thee
in
every
love
of
mine
no
new
moon
ever
cometh
no
flower
ever
bloometh
no
twilight
ever
gloometh
but
i
more
only
thine
oh
look
not
on
me
marian
thine
eyes
are
wild
and
deep
and
they
have
won
me
marian
from
peacefulness
and
sleep
the
sunlight
doth
not
sun
me
the
meek
moonshine
doth
shun
me
all
sweetest
voices
stun
me
there
is
no
rest
within
my
breast
and
i
can
only
weep
marian
as
a
landbird
far
at
sea
doth
wander
through
the
sleet
and
drooping
downward
wearily
finds
no
rest
for
her
feet
so
wandereth
my
memory
the
years
when
we
did
meet
i
used
to
say
that
everything
partook
a
share
of
thee
that
not
a
little
bird
could
sing
or
green
leaf
flutter
on
a
tree
that
nothing
could
be
beautiful
save
part
of
thee
were
there
that
from
thy
soul
so
clear
and
full
all
bright
and
blessèd
things
did
cull
the
charm
to
make
them
fair
and
now
i
know
that
it
was
so
thy
spirit
through
the
earth
doth
flow
and
face
me
i
go
what
right
hath
perfectness
to
give
such
weary
weight
of
woe
unto
the
soul
which
can
not
live
on
anything
more
low
oh
leave
me
leave
me
marian
there
no
fair
thing
i
see
but
doth
deceive
me
marian
into
sad
dreams
of
thee
a
cold
snake
gnaws
my
heart
and
crushes
round
my
brain
and
i
should
glory
but
to
part
so
bitterly
again
feeling
the
slow
tears
start
and
fall
in
fiery
rain
there
a
wide
ring
round
the
moon
the
clouds
glide
by
and
i
hear
the
sad
winds
croon
a
dirge
to
the
lowering
sky
there
nothing
soft
or
mild
in
the
pale
moon
sickly
light
but
all
looks
strange
and
wild
through
the
dim
foreboding
night
i
think
thou
must
be
dead
in
some
dark
and
lonely
place
with
candles
at
thy
head
and
a
pall
above
thee
spread
to
hide
thy
dead
cold
face
but
i
can
see
thee
underneath
so
pale
and
still
and
fair
thine
eyes
closed
smoothly
and
a
wreath
of
flowers
in
thy
hair
i
never
saw
thy
face
so
clear
when
thou
wast
with
the
living
as
now
beneath
the
pall
so
drear
and
stiff
and
unforgiving
i
can
not
flee
thee
marian
i
can
not
turn
away
mine
eyes
must
see
thee
marian
through
salt
tears
night
and
day
a
dirge
poet
lonely
is
thy
bed
and
the
turf
is
overhead
cold
earth
is
thy
cover
but
thy
heart
hath
found
release
and
it
slumbers
full
of
peace
the
rustle
of
green
trees
and
the
warm
hum
of
the
bees
mid
the
drowsy
clover
through
thy
chamber
still
as
death
a
smooth
gurgle
wandereth
as
the
blue
stream
murmureth
to
the
blue
sky
over
three
paces
from
the
silver
strand
gently
in
the
fine
white
sand
with
a
lily
in
thy
hand
pale
as
snow
they
laid
thee
in
no
coarse
earth
wast
thou
hid
and
no
gloomy
darkly
overweighed
thee
silently
as
drift
the
smooth
sand
did
sift
and
sift
the
bed
they
made
thee
all
sweet
birds
did
come
and
sing
at
thy
sunny
burying
choristers
unbidden
and
beloved
of
sun
and
dew
meek
upgrew
where
thine
eyes
so
large
and
blue
the
turf
were
hidden
where
thy
stainless
clay
doth
lie
blue
and
open
is
the
sky
and
the
white
clouds
wander
by
dreams
of
summer
silently
darkening
the
river
thou
hearest
the
clear
water
run
and
the
ripples
every
one
scattering
the
golden
sun
through
thy
silence
quiver
vines
trail
down
upon
the
stream
into
its
smooth
and
glassy
dream
a
green
stillness
spreading
and
the
shiner
perch
and
bream
through
the
shadowed
waters
gleam
the
current
heading
white
as
snow
thy
winding
sheet
shelters
thee
from
head
to
feet
save
thy
pale
face
only
thy
face
is
turned
toward
the
skies
the
lids
lie
meekly
thine
eyes
and
the
sighs
thy
bed
so
lonely
all
thy
life
thou
its
shade
underneath
it
thou
art
laid
in
an
endless
shelter
thou
hearest
it
forever
sigh
as
the
wind
vague
longings
die
in
its
branches
dim
and
high
thou
the
waters
gliding
by
slumberously
welter
thou
wast
full
of
love
and
truth
of
forgiveness
and
ruth
thy
great
heart
with
hope
and
youth
tided
to
thou
didst
dwell
in
mysteries
and
there
lingered
on
thine
eyes
shadows
of
serener
skies
awfully
wild
memories
that
were
like
foreknowing
through
the
earth
thou
have
gone
lighted
from
within
alone
seeds
from
flowers
in
heaven
grown
with
a
free
hand
sowing
thou
didst
remember
well
and
long
some
fragments
of
thine
and
strive
through
want
of
woe
and
wrong
to
win
the
world
unto
it
thy
sin
it
was
to
see
and
hear
beyond
dim
hemisphere
beyond
all
mists
of
hope
and
fear
into
a
life
more
true
and
clear
and
dearly
thou
didst
rue
it
light
of
the
new
world
thou
hadst
won
by
a
purer
sun
slowly
fate
ship
came
drifting
on
and
through
the
dark
save
thou
not
one
caught
of
the
land
a
token
thou
upon
the
farthest
prow
something
within
thy
soul
said
now
and
leaping
forth
with
eager
brow
thou
on
shore
long
time
thy
brethren
stood
in
fear
only
the
breakers
far
and
near
white
with
their
anger
they
could
hear
the
sounds
of
land
which
thy
quick
ear
caught
long
ago
they
heard
not
and
when
at
last
they
reached
the
strand
they
found
thee
lying
on
the
sand
with
some
wild
flowers
in
thy
hand
but
thy
cold
bosom
stirred
not
they
listened
but
they
heard
no
sound
save
from
the
glad
life
all
around
a
low
contented
murmur
the
long
grass
flowed
adown
the
hill
a
hum
rose
from
a
hidden
rill
but
thy
glad
heart
that
knew
no
ill
but
too
much
love
lay
dead
and
still
the
only
thing
that
sent
a
chill
into
the
heart
of
summer
thou
didst
not
seek
the
poet
wreath
but
too
soon
didst
win
it
without
was
green
but
underneath
were
scorn
and
loneliness
and
death
gnawing
the
brain
with
burning
teeth
and
making
mock
within
it
thou
who
wast
full
of
nobleness
whose
very
was
to
bless
whose
soul
one
law
was
giving
must
bandy
words
with
wickedness
haggle
with
hunger
and
distress
to
win
that
death
which
worldliness
calls
bitterly
a
living
thou
no
gold
and
shalt
not
reap
muttered
earth
turning
in
her
sleep
come
home
to
the
eternal
deep
murmured
a
voice
and
a
wide
sweep
of
wings
through
thy
soul
hush
did
creep
as
of
thy
doom
it
seem
that
thy
strong
heart
would
leap
out
of
thy
breast
and
thou
didst
weep
but
not
with
fear
of
dying
men
could
not
fathom
thy
deep
fears
they
could
not
understand
thy
tears
the
hoarded
agony
of
years
of
bitter
so
once
when
high
above
the
spheres
thy
spirit
sought
its
starry
peers
it
came
not
back
to
face
the
jeers
of
brothers
who
denied
it
thou
dost
possess
the
deeps
of
god
and
thy
white
body
sleeps
where
the
lone
pine
forever
keeps
patient
watch
beside
it
poet
underneath
the
turf
soft
thou
sleepest
free
from
morrow
thou
hast
struggled
through
the
surf
of
wild
thoughts
and
want
and
sorrow
now
beneath
the
moaning
pine
full
of
rest
thy
body
lieth
while
far
up
is
clear
sunshine
underneath
a
sky
divine
her
loosed
wings
thy
spirit
trieth
oft
she
strove
to
spread
them
here
but
they
were
too
white
and
clear
for
our
dingy
atmosphere
thy
body
findeth
ample
room
in
its
still
and
grassy
tomb
by
the
silent
river
but
thy
spirit
found
the
earth
narrow
for
the
mighty
birth
which
it
dreamed
of
ever
thou
wast
guilty
of
a
rhyme
learned
in
a
benigner
clime
and
of
that
more
grievous
crime
an
ideal
too
sublime
for
the
sky
of
time
the
calm
spot
where
thy
body
lies
gladdens
thy
soul
in
paradise
it
is
so
still
and
holy
thy
body
sleeps
serenely
there
and
well
for
it
thy
soul
may
care
it
was
so
beautiful
and
fair
lily
white
so
wholly
from
so
pure
and
sweet
a
frame
thy
spirit
parted
as
it
came
gentle
as
a
maiden
now
it
lieth
full
of
rest
sods
are
lighter
on
its
breast
than
the
great
prophetic
guest
wherewith
it
was
laden
fancies
about
a
rosebud
pressed
in
an
old
copy
of
spenser
who
prest
you
here
the
past
can
tell
when
summer
skies
were
bright
above
and
some
full
heart
did
leap
and
swell
beneath
the
white
new
moon
of
love
some
poet
haply
when
the
world
showed
like
a
calm
sea
grand
and
blue
ere
its
cold
inky
waves
had
curled
the
numb
heart
once
warm
and
true
when
with
his
soul
brimful
of
morn
he
looked
beyond
the
vale
of
time
nor
saw
therein
the
dullard
scorn
that
made
his
heavenliness
a
crime
when
musing
the
poets
olden
his
soul
did
like
a
sun
upstart
to
shoot
its
arrows
clear
and
golden
through
slavery
cold
and
darksome
heart
alas
too
soon
the
veil
is
lifted
that
hangs
between
the
soul
and
pain
too
soon
the
hath
drifted
into
dull
cloud
or
fallen
in
rain
or
were
you
prest
by
one
who
nurst
bleak
memories
of
love
gone
by
whose
heart
like
a
star
fallen
burst
in
dark
and
erring
vacancy
to
him
you
still
were
fresh
and
green
as
when
you
grew
upon
the
stalk
and
many
a
breezy
summer
scene
came
back
and
many
a
moonlit
walk
and
there
would
be
a
hum
of
bees
a
smell
of
childhood
in
the
air
and
old
fresh
feelings
cooled
the
breeze
that
like
loved
fingers
stirred
his
hair
then
would
you
suddenly
be
blasted
by
the
keen
wind
of
one
dark
thought
one
nameless
woe
that
had
outlasted
the
sudden
blow
whereby
was
brought
or
were
you
prest
here
by
two
lovers
who
seemed
to
read
these
verses
rare
but
found
between
the
antique
covers
what
spenser
could
not
prison
there
songs
which
his
glorious
soul
had
heard
but
his
dull
pen
could
never
write
which
flew
like
some
bird
through
the
blue
heaven
out
of
sight
my
heart
is
with
them
as
they
sit
i
see
the
rosebud
in
her
breast
i
see
her
small
hand
taking
it
from
out
its
odorous
snowy
nest
i
hear
him
swear
that
he
will
keep
it
in
memory
of
that
blessed
day
to
smile
on
it
or
it
when
she
and
spring
are
far
away
ah
me
i
needs
must
droop
my
head
and
brush
away
a
happy
tear
for
they
are
gone
and
dry
and
dead
the
rosebud
lies
before
me
here
yet
is
it
in
no
stranger
hand
for
i
will
guard
it
tenderly
and
it
shall
be
a
magic
wand
to
bring
mine
own
true
love
to
me
my
heart
runs
with
sweet
surmises
the
while
my
fancy
weaves
her
rhyme
kind
hopes
and
musical
surprises
throng
round
me
from
the
olden
time
i
do
not
care
to
know
who
prest
you
enough
for
me
to
feel
and
know
that
some
heart
love
and
longing
blest
you
knitting
with
new
year
eve
a
fragment
the
night
is
calm
and
beautiful
the
snow
sparkles
beneath
the
clear
and
frosty
moon
and
the
cold
stars
as
if
it
took
delight
in
its
own
silent
whiteness
the
hushed
earth
sleeps
in
the
soft
arms
of
the
embracing
blue
secure
as
if
angelic
squadrons
yet
encamped
about
her
and
each
watching
star
gained
double
brightness
from
the
flashing
arms
of
wingèd
and
unsleeping
sentinels
upward
the
calm
of
infinite
silence
deepens
the
sea
that
flows
between
high
heaven
and
earth
musing
by
whose
smooth
brink
we
sometimes
find
a
stray
leaf
floated
from
those
happier
shores
and
hope
perchance
not
vainly
that
some
flower
which
we
had
watered
with
our
holiest
tears
pale
blooms
and
yet
our
scanty
garden
best
the
same
ocean
piloted
by
love
may
find
a
haven
at
the
feet
of
god
and
be
not
wholly
worthless
in
his
sight
o
high
dependence
on
a
higher
power
sole
stay
for
all
these
restless
faculties
that
wander
the
desert
bare
wherein
our
human
knowledge
hath
its
home
shifting
their
tents
from
day
to
day
with
each
oasis
wearied
soon
and
only
certain
of
uncertainty
o
mighty
humbleness
that
feels
with
awe
yet
with
a
vast
exulting
feels
no
less
that
this
huge
minster
of
the
universe
whose
smallest
oratories
are
glorious
worlds
with
painted
oriels
of
dawn
and
sunset
whose
carvèd
ornaments
are
systems
grand
orion
kneeling
in
his
starry
niche
the
lyre
whose
strings
give
music
audible
to
holy
ears
and
countless
splendors
more
crowned
by
the
blazing
cross
all
whose
organ
music
is
the
solemn
stops
of
endless
change
breathed
through
by
endless
good
whose
choristers
are
all
the
morning
stars
whose
altar
is
the
sacred
human
heart
whereon
love
candles
burn
unquenchably
trimmed
day
and
night
by
peace
with
all
its
arches
and
its
pinnacles
that
stretch
forever
and
forever
up
is
founded
on
the
silent
heart
of
god
silent
yet
pulsing
forth
exhaustless
life
through
the
least
veins
of
all
created
things
fit
musings
these
for
the
departing
year
and
god
be
thanked
for
such
a
crystal
night
as
fills
the
spirit
with
good
store
of
thoughts
that
like
a
cheering
fire
of
walnut
crackle
upon
the
hearthstone
of
the
heart
and
cast
a
mild
all
humanity
yes
though
the
poisoned
shafts
of
evil
doubts
assail
the
skyey
panoply
of
faith
though
the
great
hopes
which
we
have
had
for
man
foes
in
disguise
because
they
based
belief
on
man
endeavor
not
on
god
decree
though
these
hopes
once
turned
to
fly
hurl
backward
many
a
deadly
parthian
dart
that
rankles
in
the
soul
and
makes
it
sick
with
vain
regret
nigh
verging
on
despair
yet
in
such
calm
and
earnest
hours
as
this
we
well
can
feel
how
every
living
heart
that
sleeps
in
palace
or
in
cot
or
unroofed
hovel
or
which
need
hath
known
of
other
homestead
than
the
arching
sky
is
circled
watchfully
with
seraph
fires
how
our
own
erring
will
it
is
that
hangs
the
flaming
sword
eden
unclosed
gate
which
gives
free
entrance
to
the
pure
in
heart
and
with
its
guarding
walls
doth
fence
the
meek
sleep
then
o
earth
in
thy
cradle
bent
over
always
by
thy
mother
heaven
we
all
are
tall
enough
to
reach
god
hand
and
angels
are
no
taller
looking
back
upon
the
smooth
wake
of
a
year
we
see
the
black
clouds
furling
one
by
one
from
the
advancing
majesty
of
truth
and
something
won
for
freedom
whose
least
gain
is
as
a
firm
and
citadel
wherefrom
to
launch
fresh
battle
on
her
foes
or
leaning
from
the
time
extremest
prow
if
we
gaze
forward
through
the
blinding
spray
and
dimly
see
how
much
of
ill
remains
how
many
fetters
to
be
sawn
asunder
by
the
slow
toil
of
individual
zeal
or
haply
rusted
by
salt
tears
in
twain
we
feel
with
something
of
a
sadder
heart
yet
bracing
up
our
bruisèd
mail
the
while
and
fronting
the
old
foe
with
fresher
spirit
how
great
it
is
to
breathe
with
human
breath
to
be
but
poor
in
the
ranks
of
our
old
exiled
king
humanity
encamping
after
every
field
nearer
and
nearer
heaven
happy
plains
many
great
souls
have
gone
to
rest
and
sleep
under
this
armor
free
and
full
of
peace
if
these
have
left
the
earth
yet
truth
remains
endurance
too
the
crowning
faculty
of
noble
minds
and
love
invincible
by
any
weapons
and
these
hem
us
round
with
silence
such
that
all
the
groaning
clank
of
this
mad
engine
men
have
made
of
earth
dulls
not
some
ears
for
catching
purer
tones
that
wander
from
the
dim
surrounding
vast
or
far
more
clear
melodious
prophecies
the
natural
music
of
the
heart
of
man
which
by
kind
sorrow
ministry
hath
learned
that
the
true
sceptre
of
all
power
is
love
and
humbleness
the
of
truth
what
man
with
soul
so
blind
as
sees
not
here
the
first
faint
tremble
of
hope
foretelling
how
the
shafts
of
dawn
fitted
already
on
their
golden
string
shall
soon
leap
earthward
with
exulting
flight
to
thrid
the
dark
heart
of
that
evil
faith
whose
trust
is
in
the
clumsy
arms
of
force
the
ozier
hauberk
of
a
ruder
age
freedom
thou
other
name
for
happy
truth
thou
whose
feet
were
never
out
of
the
stirrup
nor
thy
lance
uncouched
nor
thy
fierce
eye
enticèd
from
its
watch
thou
hast
learned
now
by
in
vain
poured
to
enrich
the
soil
which
tyrants
reap
by
wasted
lives
of
prophets
and
of
those
who
by
the
promise
in
their
souls
upheld
into
the

sunset

had
dimmed
away
into

twilight
doubtful
gray
one
long
cloud
the
horizon
lay
which
a
streak
of
bluish
white
wavered
between
the
day
and
night
over
the
pine
trees
on
the
hill
the
trembly
did
thrill
and
the
new
moon
with
slender
rim
through
the
elm
arches
gleaming
dim
filled
memory
chalice
to
the
brim

on
such
an
eve
the
heart
doth
grow
full
of
surmise
and
scarce
can
know
if
it
be
now
or
long
ago
or
if
indeed
it
doth
exist
a
wonderful
enchanted
mist
from
the
new
moon
doth
wander
out
wrapping
all
things
in
mystic
doubt
so
that
this
world
doth
seem
untrue
and
all
our
fancies
to
take
hue
from
some
life
ages
since
gone
through
iii
the
maiden
sat
and
heard
the
flow
of
the
west
wind
so
soft
and
low
the
leaves
scarce
quivered
to
and
fro
unbound
her
heavy
golden
hair
rippled
across
her
bosom
bare
which
gleamed
with
thrilling
snowy
white
far
through
the
magical
moonlight
the
breeze
rose
with
a
rustling
swell
and
from
afar
there
came
the
smell
of
a
iv
the
dim
moon
rested
on
the
hill
but
silent
without
thought
or
will
where
sat
the
dreamy
maiden
still
and
now
the
moon
tip
like
a
star
drew
down
below
the
horizon
bar
to
her
black
noon
the
night
hath
grown
yet
still
the
maiden
sits
alone
pale
as
a
corpse
beneath
a
stream
and
her
white
bosom
still
doth
gleam
through
the
deep
midnight
like
a
dream
cloudless
the
morning
came
and
fair
and
lavishly
the
sun
doth
share
his
gold
among
her
golden
hair
kindling
it
all
till
slowly
so
a
glory
round
her
head
doth
glow
a
withered
flower
is
in
her
hand
that
grew
in
some
far
distant
land
and
silently
transfigurèd
with
wide
calm
eyes
and
undrooped
head
they
found
the
dead

a
youth
that
morn
other
skies
felt
sudden
tears
burn
in
his
eyes
and
his
heart
throng
with
memories
all
things
without
him
seemed
to
win
strange
brotherhood
with
things
within
and
he
forever
felt
that
he
walked
in
the
midst
of
mystery
and
thenceforth
why
he
could
not
tell
his
heart
would
curdle
at
the
smell
of
his
vii
something
from
him
had
passed
away
some
shifting
trembles
of
clear
day
through
starry
crannies
in
his
clay
grew
bright
and
steadfast
more
and
more
where
all
had
been
dull
earth
before
and
through
these
chinks
like
him
of
old
his
spirit
converse
high
did
hold
with
clearer
loves
and
wider
powers
that
brought
him
dewy
fruits
and
flowers
from
far
elysian
groves
and
bowers
viii
just
on
the
farther
bound
of
sense
unproved
by
outward
evidence
but
known
by
a
deep
influence
which
through
our
grosser
clay
doth
shine
with
light
unwaning
and
divine
beyond
where
highest
thought
can
fly
stretcheth
the
world
of
mystery
and
they
not
greatly
overween
who
deem
that
nothing
true
hath
been
save
the
unspeakable
unseen
ix
one
step
beyond

things
one
more
beat
of
the
soul
broad
wings
one
deeper
sorrow
sometimes
brings
the
spirit
into
that
great
vast
where
neither
future
is
nor
past
none
knoweth
how
he
entered
there
but
waking
finds
his
spirit
where
he
thought
an
angel
could
not
soar
and
what
he
called
false
dreams
before
the
very
air
about
his
door
x
these
outward
seemings
are
but
shows
whereby
the
body
sees
and
knows
far
down
beneath
forever
flows
a
stream
of
subtlest
sympathies
that
make
our
spirits
strangely
wise
in
awe
and
fearful
bodings
dim
which
from
the
sense
outer
rim
stretch
forth
beyond
our
thought
and
sight
fine
arteries
of
circling
light
pulsed
outward

the

to
a
year

first
the
youthful
poet
leads
and
he
is
glad
to
follow
her
kind
is
she
and
to
all
his
needs
with
a
free
hand
doth
minister
but
when
sweet
hope
at
last
hath
fled
cometh
her
sister
memory
she
wreathes
hope
garlands
round
her
head
and
strives
to
seem
as
fair
as
she
then
hope
comes
back
and
by
the
hand
she
leads
a
child
most
fair
to
see
who
with
a
joyous
face
doth
stand
uniting
hope
and
memory
so
brighter
grew

around

through

sake

lady

thy
sleeping
peaceful
may
thy
dreamings
be
while
around
thy
soul
is
sweeping
our
melody
chant
we
brothers
sad
and
slow
let
our
song
be
soft
and
low
as
the
voice
of
other
years
let
our
hearts
within
us
melt
to
gentleness
as
if
we
felt
the
dropping
of
our
mother
tears
lady
now
our
song
is
bringing
back
again
thy
childhood
hours
hearest
thou
the
humbee
singing
drowsily
among
the
flowers
sleepily
sleepily
in
the
noontide
swayeth
he
half
rested
on
the
slender
stalks
that
edge
those
garden
walks
hearest
thou
the
fitful
whirring
of
the
humbird
viewless
wings
not
round
thy
heart
the
stirring
of
childhood
things
seest
thou
the
dear
old
dwelling
with
the
woodbine
round
the
door
brothers
soft
her
breast
is
swelling
with
the
busy
thoughts
of
yore
lowly

ye
sing
ye
mildly
house
her
spirit
not
so
wildly
lest
she
sleep
not
any
more
is
the
pleasant
summertide
open
stands
the
window
wide
whose
voices
lady
art
thou
drinking
who
sings
the
best
belovèd
tune
in
a
clear
note
rising
sinking
like
a
thrush
song
in
june
whose
laugh
is
that
which
rings
so
clear
and
joyous
in
thine
eager
ear
lower
brothers
yet
more
low
weave
the
song
in
mazy
twines
she
heareth
now
the
west
wind
blow
at
evening
through
the
clump
of
pines
o
mournful
is
their
tune
as
of
a
crazèd
thing
who
to
herself
alone
is
ever
murmuring
through
the
night
and
through
the
day
for
something
that
hath
passed
away
often
lady
hast
thou
listened
often
have
thy
blue
eyes
glistened
where
the
summer
evening
breeze
moaned
sadly
through
those
lonely
trees
or
with
the
fierce
wind
from
the
north
wrung
their
mournful
music
forth
ever
the
river
floweth
in
an
unbroken
stream
ever
the
west
wind
bloweth
murmuring
as
he
goeth
and
mingling
with
her
dream
onward
still
the
river
sweepeth
with
a
sound
of
lowly
brothers
lo
she
weepeth
she
is
now
no
more
alone
forms
and
faces
round
about
her
pillow
throng
through
her
memory
desert
places
flow
the
waters
of
our
song
lady
if
thy
life
be
holy
as
when
thou
wert
yet
a
child
though
our
song
be
melancholy
it
will
stir
no
anguish
wild
for
the
soul
that
hath
lived
well
for
the
soul
that
is
there
is
quiet
in
the
spell
that
brings
back
early
memories
song
i
lift
up
the
curtains
of
thine
eyes
and
let
their
light
outshine
let
me
adore
the
mysteries
of
those
mild
orbs
of
thine
which
ever
queenly
calm
do
roll
attunèd
to
an
ordered
soul
ii
open
thy
lips
yet
once
again
and
while
my
soul
doth
hush
with
awe
pour
forth
that
holy
strain
which
seemeth
me
to
gush
a
fount
of
music
running
from
thy
deep
spirit
inmost
core
iii
the
melody
that
dwells
in
thee
begets
in
me
as
well
a
spiritual
harmony
a
mild
and
blessèd
spell
far
far
above
earth
atmosphere
i
rise
thy
voice
i
hear
the
departed
not
they
alone
are
the
departed
who
have
laid
them
down
to
sleep
in
the
grave
narrow
and
lonely
not
for
them
only
do
i
vigils
keep
not
for
them
only
am
i
not
for
them
only
many
many
there
are
many
who
no
more
are
with
me
here
as
cherished
as
beloved
as
any
whom
i
have
seen
upon
the
bier
i
weep
to
think
of
those
old
faces
to
see
them
in
their
grief
or
mirth
i
weep
for
there
are
empty
places
around
my
heart
once
crowded
hearth
the
cold
ground
doth
not
cover
them
the
grass
hath
not
grown
over
them
yet
are
they
gone
from
me
on
earth
o
how
more
bitter
is
this
weeping
than
for
those
lost
ones
who
are
sleeping
where
sun
will
shine
and
flowers
blow
where
gentle
winds
will
whisper
low
and
the
stars
have
them
in
their
keeping
wherefore
from
me
who
loved
you
so
o
wherefore
did
ye
go
i
have
shed
full
many
a
tear
i
have
wrestled
oft
in
prayer
but
ye
do
not
come
again
how
could
anything
so
dear
how
could
anything
so
fair
vanish
like
the
summer
rain
no
no
it
can
not
be
but
ye
are
still
with
me
and
yet
o
where
art
thou
childhood
with
sunny
brow
and
floating
hair
where
art
thou
hiding
now
i
have
sought
thee
everywhere
all
among
the
shrubs
and
flowers
of
those
of
ours
thou
art
not
there
when
the
shadow
of
night
wings
hath
darkened
all
the
earth
i
listen
for
thy
gambolings
beside
the
cheerful
hearth
thou
art
not
there
i
listen
to
the
bell
i
murmur
the
little
songs
which
thou
didst
love
so
well
pleasant
memories
come
in
throngs
and
mine
eyes
are
blurred
with
tears
but
no
glimpse
of
thee
appears
lonely
am
i
in
the
winter
lonely
in
the
spring
summer
and
harvest
bring
no
trace
of
thee
oh
whither
whither
art
thou
wandering
thou
who
didst
once
so
cleave
to
me
and
love
is
gone
i
have
seen
him
come
i
have
seen
him
too
depart
leaving
desolate
his
home
his
bright
home
in
my
heart
i
am
alone
cold
cold
is
his
wide
open
stands
the
door
the
frolic
and
the
gentle
one
shall
i
see
no
more
no
more
at
the
fount
the
bowl
is
broken
i
shall
drink
it
not
again
all
my
longing
prayers
are
spoken
and
felt
ah
woe
is
me
in
vain
oh
childish
hopes
and
childish
fancies
whither
have
ye
fled
away
i
long
for
you
in
mournful
trances
i
long
for
you
by
night
and
day
beautiful
thoughts
that
once
were
mine
might
i
but
win
you
back
once
more
might
ye
about
my
being
twine
and
cluster
as
ye
did
of
yore
o
do
not
let
me
pray
in
vain
how
good
and
happy
i
should
be
how
free
from
every
shade
of
pain
if
ye
would
come
again
to
me
o
come
again
come
come
again
hath
the
sun
forgot
its
brightness
have
the
stars
forgot
to
shine
that
they
bring
not
their
wonted
lightness
to
this
weary
heart
of
mine
is
not
the
sun
that
shone
on
thee
happy
childhood
long
ago
not
the
same
stars
silently
looking
on
the
same
bright
snow
not
the
same
that
love
and
i
together
watched
in
days
gone
by
no
not
the
same
alas
for
me
would
god
that
those
who
early
went
to
the
house
dark
and
low
for
whom
our
mourning
heads
were
bent
for
whom
our
steps
were
slow
o
would
that
these
alone
had
left
us
that
fate
of
these
alone
had
reft
us
would
god
indeed
that
it
were
so
many
leaves
too
soon
must
wither
many
flowers
too
soon
must
die
many
bright
ones
wandering
hither
we
know
not
whence
we
know
not
why
like
the
leaves
and
like
the
flowers
vanish
ere
the
summer
hours
that
brought
them
to
us
have
gone
by
o
for
the
hopes
and
for
the
feelings
childhood
that
i
shared
with
thee
the
high
resolves
the
bright
revealings
of
the
soul
might
which
thou
me
gentle
love
woe
worth
the
day
woe
worth
the
hour
when
thou
wert
born
woe
worth
the
day
thou
away
a
shade
across
the
corn
a
dewdrop
falling
from
the
leaves
in
a
summer
morn
woe
woe
is
me
my
sick
heart
grieves
companionless
and
i
know
it
well
our
manly
years
must
be
baptized
in
bitter
tears
full
many
fountains
must
run
dry
that
youth
has
dreamed
for
long
hours
by
choked
by
convention
siroc
blast
or
drifting
sands
of
many
cares
slowly
they
leave
us
all
at
last
and
cease
their
flowing
unawares
the
bobolink
anacreon
of
the
meadow
drunk
with
the
joy
of
spring
beneath
the
tall
pine
voiceful
shadow
i
lie
and
drink
thy
jargoning
my
soul
is
full
with
melodies
one
drop
would
overflow
it
and
send
the
tears
into
mine
eyes
but
what
thou
to
know
it
thy
heart
is
free
as
mountain
air
and
of
thy
lays
thou
hast
no
care
scattering
them
gayly
everywhere
happy
unconscious
poet
upon
a
tuft
of
meadow
grass
while
thy
tends
the
nest
thou
swayest
as
the
breezes
pass
unburthening
thine
breast
of
the
crowded
songs
that
fill
it
just
as
joy
may
choose
to
will
it
lord
of
thy
love
and
liberty
the
blithest
bird
of
merry
may
thou
turnest
thy
bright
eyes
on
me
that
say
as
plain
as
eye
can
say
here
sit
we
here
in
the
summer
weather
i
and
my
modest
mate
together
whatever
your
wise
thoughts
may
be
under
that
gloomy
old
pine
tree
we
do
not
value
them
a
feather
now
leaving
earth
and
me
behind
thou
beatest
up
against
the
wind
or
floating
slowly
down
before
it
above
thy
nest
thou
flutterest
and
thy
bridal
utterest
raining
showers
of
music
it
weary
never
still
thou
trillest
lays
as
of
murmuring
through
pebbly
nooks
in
quiet
summer
days
my
heart
with
happiness
thou
fillest
i
seem
again
to
be
a
boy
watching
thee
gay
blithesome
lover
the
bending
hover
quivering
thy
wings
for
joy
there
something
in
the
the
greening
grass
and
bobolink
song
that
wakes
again
within
my
bosom
feelings
which
have
slumbered
long
as
long
long
years
ago
i
wandered
i
seem
to
wander
even
yet
the
hours
the
idle
squandered
the
man
would
die
ere
he
forget
o
hours
that
frosty
eld
deemed
wasted
nodding
his
gray
head
toward
my
books
i
dearer
prize
the
lore
i
tasted
with
you
among
the
trees
and
brooks
than
all
that
i
have
gained
since
then
from
learnèd
books
or
men
nature
thy
soul
was
one
with
mine
and
as
a
sister
by
a
younger
brother
is
loved
each
flowing
to
the
other
such
love
for
me
was
thine
or
wert
thou
not
more
like
a
loving
mother
with
sympathy
and
loving
power
to
heal
against
whose
heart
my
throbbing
heart
i
lay
and
moan
my
childish
sorrows
all
away
till
calm
and
holiness
would
me
steal
was
not
the
golden
sunset
a
dear
friend
found
i
no
kindness
in
the
silent
moon
and
the
green
trees
whose
tops
did
sway
and
bend
low
singing
evermore
their
pleasant
tune
felt
i
no
heart
in
dim
and
solemn
woods
no
voice
in
lonely
solitudes
yes
yes
unhoodwinked
then
my
spirit
eyes
blind
leaders
had
not
to
be
wise
dear
hours
which
now
again
i
hearing
and
seeing
with
the
ears
and
eyes
of
childhood
ye
were
bees
that
to
the
hive
of
my
young
heart
came
laden
with
rich
prize
gathered
in
fields
and
woods
and
sunny
dells
to
be
my
spirit
food
in
days
more
wintery
yea
yet
again
ye
come
ye
come
and
like
a
child
once
more
at
home
after
long
sojourning
in
alien
climes
i
lie
upon
my
mother
breast
feeling
the
blessedness
of
rest
and
dwelling
in
the
light
of
other
times
o
ye
whose
living
is
not
whose
dying
is
but
death
song
empty
toil
and
petty
strife
rounded
with
loss
of
breath
go
look
on
nature
countenance
drink
in
the
blessing
of
her
glance
look
on
the
sunset
hear
the
wind
the
cataract
the
awful
thunder
go
worship
by
the
sea
then
and
then
only
shall
ye
find
with
wonder
man
is
not
all
in
all
to
ye
go
with
a
meek
and
humble
soul
then
shall
the
scales
of
self
unroll
from
off
your
eyes
the
weary
packs
drop
from
your
backs
and
ye
shall
see
with
reverent
and
hopeful
eyes
glowing
with
energies
how
great
a
thing
it
is
to
forgetfulness
there
a
haven
of
sure
rest
from
the
loud
world
bewildering
stress
as
a
bird
dreaming
on
her
nest
as
dew
hid
in
a
rose
breast
as
hesper
in
the
glowing
west
so
the
heart
sleeps
in
thy
calm
deeps
serene
forgetfulness
no
sorrow
in
that
place
may
be
the
noise
of
life
grows
less
and
less
as
moss
far
down
within
the
sea
as
in
white
lily
caves
a
bee
as
life
in
a
hazy
reverie
so
the
heart
wave
in
thy
dim
cave
hushes
forgetfulness
duty
and
care
fade
far
away
what
toil
may
be
we
can
not
guess
as
a
ship
anchored
in
the
bay
as
a
cloud
at
astray
as
in
a
breezeless
day
so
thine
eyes
the
full
heart
lies
and
dreams
forgetfulness
song
i
what
reck
i
of
the
stars
when
i
may
gaze
into
thine
eyes
which
the
brown
hair
flowingly
is
parted
maidenwise
from
thy
pale
forehead
calm
and
bright
over
thy
cheeks
so
rosy
white
ii
what
care
i
for
the
red
far
liefer
would
i
sit
and
watch
the
joy
within
thine
eyes
gush
up
at
sight
of
it
thyself
my
queenly
moon
shall
be
ruling
my
heart
deep
tides
for
me
iii
what
heed
i
if
the
sky
be
blue
so
are
thy
holy
eyes
and
bright
with
shadows
ever
new
of
changeful
sympathies
which
in
thy
soul
unruffled
deep
rest
evermore
but
never
sleep
the
poet
he
who
hath
felt
life
mystery
press
on
him
like
thick
night
whose
soul
hath
known
no
history
but
struggling
after
light
he
who
hath
seen
dim
shapes
arise
in
the
soundless
depths
of
soul
which
gaze
on
him
with
meaning
eyes
full
of
the
mighty
whole
yet
will
no
word
of
healing
speak
although
he
pray
o
help
me
save
me
i
am
weak
and
ye
are
wondrous
strong
who
in
the
midnight
dark
and
deep
hath
felt
a
voice
of
might
come
echoing
through
the
halls
of
sleep
from
the
lone
heart
of
night
and
starting
from
his
restless
bed
hath
watched
and
wept
to
know
what
meant
that
oracle
of
dread
that
stirred
his
being
so
he
who
hath
felt
how
strong
and
great
this
godlike
soul
of
man
and
looked
full
in
the
eyes
of
fate
since
life
and
thought
began
the
armor
of
whose
moveless
trust
knoweth
no
spot
of
weakness
who
hath
trod
fear
into
the
dust
beneath
the
feet
of
meekness
he
who
hath
calmly
borne
his
cross
knowing
himself
the
king
of
time
nor
counted
it
a
loss
to
learn
by
suffering
and
who
hath
worshipped
woman
still
with
a
pure
soul
and
lowly
nor
ever
hath
in
deed
or
will
profaned
her
temple
holy
he
is
the
poet
him
unto
the
gift
of
song
is
given
whose
life
is
lofty
strong
and
true
he
is
the
poet
from
his
lips
to
live
forevermore
majestical
as
ships
the
words
of
wisdom
pour
flowers
hail
be
thou
holie
hearbe
growing
on
the
ground
all
in
the
mount
calvary
first
wert
thou
found
thou
art
good
for
manie
a
sore
thou
healest
manie
a
wound
in
the
name
of
sweete
jesus
i
take
thee
from
the
ground
i
when
from
a
pleasant
ramble
home
with
quiet
thoughts
i
come
i
pluck
some
wayside
flower
and
press
it
in
the
choicest
nook
of
a
and
book
and
when
upon
its
leaves
i
look
in
a
less
happy
hour
dear
memory
bears
me
far
away
unto
her
fairy
bower
and
on
her
breast
my
head
i
lay
while
in
a
motherly
sweet
strain
she
sings
me
gently
back
again
to
feelings
until
they
seem
children
born
of
yesterday
ii
yes
many
a
story
of
past
hours
i
read
in
these
dear
withered
flowers
and
once
again
i
seem
to
be
lying
beneath
the
old
oak
tree
and
looking
up
into
the
sky
through
thick
leaves
rifted
fitfully
lulled
by
the
rustling
of
the
vine
or
the
faint
low
of
kine
and
once
again
i
seem
to
watch
the
whirling
bubbles
flee
through
shade
and
gleam
alternately
down
the
stream
or
the
odorous
linden
trees
when
summer
twilight
lingers
long
to
hear
the
flowing
of
the
breeze
and
unseen
insects
slumberous
song
that
mingle
into
one
and
seem
like
dim
murmurs
of
a
dream
fair
faces
too
i
seem
to
see
smiling
from
pleasant
eyes
at
me
and
voices
sweet
i
hear
that
like
remembered
melody
flow
through
my
spirit
ear
iii
a
poem
every
flower
is
and
every
leaf
a
line
and
with
delicious
memories
they
fill
this
heart
of
mine
no
living
blossoms
are
so
clear
as
these
dead
relics
treasured
here
one
tells
of
love
of
friendship
one
love
quiet
time
when
the
light
is
gone
and
with
the
soul
low
half
its
heaven
doth
a
holy
calm
and
steady
glow
some
are
gay
some
are
dirges
in
some
a
joy
with
sorrow
merges
one
sings
the
shadowed
woods
and
one
the
roar
of
ocean
everlasting
surges
tumbling
upon
the
beach
floor
or
sliding
backward
from
the
shore
to
meet
the
landward
waves
and
slowly
plunge
once
more
o
flowers
of
grace
i
bless
ye
all
by
the
dear
faces
ye
recall
iv
upon
the
banks
of
life
deep
streams
full
many
a
flower
groweth
which
with
a
wondrous
fragrance
teems
and
in
the
silent
water
gleams
and
trembles
as
the
water
floweth
many
a
one
the
wave
upteareth
washing
ever
the
roots
away
and
far
upon
its
bosom
beareth
to
bloom
no
more
in
youth
glad
may
as
farther
on
the
river
runs
flowing
more
deep
and
strong
only
a
few
pale
scattered
ones
are
seen
the
dreary
banks
along
and
where
those
flowers
do
not
grow
the
river
floweth
dark
and
chill
its
voice
is
sad
and
with
its
flow
mingles
ever
a
sense
of
ill
then
poet
thou
who
gather
dost
of
life
best
flowers
the
brightest
o
take
good
heed
they
be
not
lost
while
with
the
angry
flood
thou
fightest
in
the
cool
grottos
of
the
soul
whence
flows
thought
crystal
river
whence
songs
of
joy
forever
roll
to
him
who
is
the
giver
there
store
thou
them
where
fresh
and
green
their
leaves
and
blossoms
may
be
seen
a
spring
of
joy
that
faileth
never
there
store
thou
them
and
they
shall
be
a
blessing
and
a
peace
to
thee
and
in
their
youth
and
purity
thou
shalt
be
young
forever
then
with
their
fragrance
rich
and
rare
thy
living
shall
be
rife
strength
shall
be
thine
thy
cross
to
bear
and
they
shall
be
a
chaplet
fair
breathing
a
pure
and
holy
air
to
crown
thy
holy
life
vi
o
poet
above
all
men
blest
take
heed
that
thus
thou
store
them
love
hope
and
faith
shall
ever
rest
sweet
birds
upon
how
sweet
a
nest
watchfully
brooding
them
and
from
those
flowers
of
paradise
scatter
thou
many
a
blessèd
seed
wherefrom
an
offspring
may
arise
to
cheer
the
hearts
and
light
the
eyes
of
in
their
need
they
shall
not
fall
on
stony
ground
but
yielding
all
their
shall
shed
a
peacefulness
around
whose
strengthening
joy
may
not
be
told
so
shall
thy
name
be
blest
of
all
and
thy
remembrance
never
die
for
of
that
seed
shall
surely
fall
in
the
fair
garden
of
eternity
exult
then
in
the
nobleness
of
this
thy
work
so
holy
yet
be
not
thou
one
jot
the
less
humble
and
meek
and
lowly
but
let
thine
exultation
be
the
reverence
of
a
bended
knee
and
by
thy
life
a
poem
write
built
strongly
day
by
day
and
on
the
rock
of
truth
and
right
its
deep
foundations
lay
vii
it
is
thy
guard
it
well
for
unto
thee
hath
much
been
given
and
thou
canst
make
this
life
a
hell
or
up
to
heaven
let
not
thy
baptism
in
life
wave
make
thee
like
him
whom
homer
sings
a
sleeper
in
a
living
grave
callous
and
hard
to
outward
things
but
open
all
thy
soul
and
sense
to
every
blessèd
influence
that
from
the
heart
of
nature
springs
then
shall
thy
be
to
thee
when
thy
best
years
are
told
as
much
as
these
have
been
to
me
yea
more
a
the
lover
i
go
from
the
world
from
east
to
west
search
every
land
beneath
the
sky
you
can
not
find
a
man
so
blest
a
king
so
powerful
as
i
though
you
should
seek
eternally
ii
for
i
a
gentle
lover
be
sitting
at
my
side
she
giveth
her
whole
soul
to
me
without
a
wish
or
thought
of
pride
and
she
shall
be
my
cherished
bride
iii
no
show
of
gaudiness
hath
she
she
doth
not
flash
with
jewels
rare
in
beautiful
simplicity
she
weareth
leafy
garlands
fair
or
modest
flowers
in
her
hair
iv
sometimes
she
dons
a
robe
of
green
sometimes
a
robe
of
snowy
white
but
in
whatever
garb
she
seen
it
seems
most
beautiful
and
right
and
is
the
loveliest
to
my
sight
not
i
her
lover
am
alone
yet
unto
all
she
doth
suffice
none
jealous
is
and
every
one
reads
love
and
truth
within
her
eyes
and
deemeth
her
his
own
dear
prize
vi
and
so
thou
art
eternal
nature
yes
bride
of
heaven
so
thou
art
thou
wholly
lovest
every
creature
giving
to
each
no
stinted
part
but
filling
every
peaceful
heart
to
dear
child
dear
happy
girl
if
thou
appear
heedless
untouched
with
awe
or
serious
thought
thy
nature
is
not
therefore
less
divine
thou
liest
in
abraham
bosom
all
the
year
and
at
the
temple
inner
shrine
god
being
with
thee
when
we
know
it
not
as
through
a
strip
of
sunny
light
a
white
dove
flashes
swiftly
on
so
suddenly
before
my
sight
thou
a
moment
and
wert
gone
and
yet
i
long
shall
bear
in
mind
the
pleasant
thoughts
thou
behind
thou
me
happy
with
thine
eyes
and
happy
with
thine
open
smile
and
as
i
write
sweet
memories
come
thronging
round
me
all
the
while
thou
me
happy
with
thine
eyes
and
gentle
feelings
long
forgot
looked
up
and
oped
their
eyes
like
violets
when
they
see
a
spot
of
summer
in
the
skies
around
thy
playful
lips
did
glitter
of
a
girlish
scorn
harmless
they
were
for
nothing
bitter
in
thy
dear
heart
was
ever
born
that
merry
heart
that
could
not
lie
within
its
warm
nest
quietly
but
ever
from
each
full
dark
eye
was
looking
kindly
night
and
morn
there
was
an
archness
in
thine
eyes
born
of
the
gentlest
mockeries
and
thy
light
laughter
rang
as
clear
as
i
loved
to
hear
in
days
of
boyhood
as
they
fell
tinkling
far
down
the
dim
still
well
and
with
its
sound
come
back
once
more
the
feelings
of
my
early
years
and
half
aloud
i
murmured
sure
i
have
heard
that
sound
before
it
is
so
pleasant
in
mine
ears
whenever
thou
didst
look
on
me
i
thought
of
merry
birds
and
something
of
spring
melody
came
to
me
in
thy
words
thy
thoughts
did
dance
and
bound
along
like
happy
children
in
their
play
whose
hearts
run
over
into
song
for
gladness
of
the
summer
day
and
mine
grew
dizzy
with
the
sight
still
feeling
lighter
and
more
light
till
joining
hands
they
whirled
away
as
blithe
and
merrily
as
they
i
bound
a
round
with
flowers
which
thou
didst
twine
among
thy
hair
and
gladsome
were
the
few
short
hours
when
i
was
with
thee
there
so
now
that
thou
art
far
away
in
thy
warmer
clime
in
memory
of
a
happier
day
i
twine
this
simple
wreath
of
rhyme
dost
mind
how
she
whom
thou
dost
love
more
than
in
light
words
may
be
said
a
coronal
of
amaranth
wove
about
thy
head
which
kept
itself
a
moment
still
that
she
might
have
her
gentle
will
thy
childlike
grace
and
purity
o
keep
forevermore
and
as
thou
art
still
strive
to
be
that
on
the
farther
shore
of
time
dark
waters
ye
may
meet
and
she
may
twine
around
thy
brow
a
wreath
of
those
bright
flowers
that
grow
where
blessèd
angels
set
their
feet
isabel
as
the
leaf
upon
the
tree
fluttering
gleaming
constantly
such
a
lightsome
thing
was
she
my
gay
and
gentle
isabel
her
heart
was
fed
with
sweet
and
in
her
face
you
see
it
beat
to
hear
the
sound
of
welcome
feet
and
were
not
mine
so
isabel
she
knew
it
not
but
she
was
fair
and
like
a
moonbeam
was
her
hair
that
falls
where
flowing
ripples
are
in
summer
evenings
isabel
her
heart
and
tongue
were
scarce
apart
unwittingly
her
lips
would
part
and
love
came
gushing
from
her
heart
the
woman
heart
of
isabel
so
pure
her
and
like
dew
that
in
her
features
glimmered
through
each
working
of
her
spirit
true
in
wondrous
beauty
isabel
a
sunbeam
struggling
through
thick
leaves
a
reaper
song
mid
yellow
sheaves
less
gladsome
were
my
spirit
grieves
to
think
of
thee
mild
isabel
i
know
not
when
i
loved
thee
first
not
loving
i
had
been
accurst
yet
having
loved
my
heart
will
burst
longing
for
thee
dear
isabel
with
silent
tears
my
cheeks
are
wet
i
would
be
calm
i
would
forget
but
thy
blue
eyes
gaze
on
me
yet
when
stars
have
risen
isabel
the
winds
mourn
for
thee
isabel
the
flowers
expect
thee
in
the
dell
thy
gentle
spirit
loved
them
well
and
i
for
thy
sake
isabel
the
sunsets
seem
less
lovely
now
than
when
leaf
checkered
on
thy
brow
they
fell
as
lovingly
as
thou
till
isabel
at
dead
of
night
i
seem
to
see
thy
fair
pale
features
constantly
upturned
in
silent
prayer
for
me
moveless
clasped
hands
isabel
i
call
thee
thou
dost
not
reply
the
stars
gleam
coldly
on
thine
eye
as
like
a
dream
thou
flittest
by
and
me
weeping
isabel
music
i
seem
to
lie
with
drooping
eyes
dreaming
sweet
dreams
half
longings
and
half
memories
in
woods
where
streams
with
trembling
shades
and
whirling
gleams
many
and
bright
in
song
and
light
are
ever
ever
flowing
while
the
wind
if
we
list
to
the
rustling
grass
which
numbers
his
footsteps
as
they
pass
seems
scarcely
to
be
blowing
and
the
voice
of
spring
from
sunny
slopes
comes
wandering
calling
the
violets
from
the
sleep
that
bound
them
under
deep
to
open
their
childlike
asking
eyes
on
the
new
summer
paradise
and
mingled
with
the
gurgling
waters
as
the
dreamy
witchery
of
acheloüs
daughters
rose
and
fell
with
the
heaving
sea
whose
great
heart
swelled
with
ecstasy
the
song
of
many
a
floating
bird
winding
through
the
rifted
trees
is
dreamily
a
sister
stream
of
melodies
rippled
by
the
flutterings
of
wings
ii
and
now
beside
a
cataract
i
lie
and
through
my
soul
from
over
me
and
under
the
thunder
arousingly
doth
roll
through
the
darkness
all
compact
through
the
trackless
sea
of
gloom
sad
and
deep
i
hear
it
boom
at
intervals
the
cloud
is
cracked
and
a
livid
flash
doth
hiss
downward
from
its
floating
home
lighting
up
the
precipice
and
the
foam
with
a
dim
and
ghastly
glare
which
for
a
in
the
air
shows
the
sweeping
shrouds
of
the
midnight
clouds
and
their
hair
iii
now
listening
to
a
woman
tone
in
a
wood
i
sit
alone
alone
because
our
souls
are
one
all
around
my
heart
it
flows
lulling
me
in
deep
repose
i
fear
to
speak
i
fear
to
move
lest
i
should
break
the
spell
i
love
low
and
gentle
calm
and
clear
into
my
inmost
soul
it
goes
as
if
my
brother
dear
who
is
no
longer
here
had
bended
from
the
sky
and
murmured
in
my
ear
a
strain
of
that
high
harmony
which
they
may
sing
alone
who
worship
round
the
throne
iv
now
in
a
fairy
boat
on
the
bright
waves
of
song
full
merrily
i
float
merrily
float
along
my
helm
is
veered
i
care
not
how
my
white
sail
bellies
over
me
and
bright
as
gold
the
ripples
be
that
plash
beneath
the
bow
before
behind
they
feel
the
wind
and
they
are
dancing
joyously
while
faintly
heard
along
the
shore
the
surf
goes
plunging
with
a
lingering
roar
or
anchored
in
a
shadowy
cove
entranced
with
harmonies
slowly
i
sink
and
rise
as
the
slow
waves
of
music
move
now
softly
dashing
bubbling
plashing
mazy
dreamy
faint
and
streamy
ripples
into
ripples
melt
not
so
strongly
heard
as
felt
now
rapid
and
quick
while
the
heart
beats
thick
the
music
silver
wavelets
crowd
distinct
and
clear
but
never
loud
and
now
all
solemnly
and
slow
in
mild
deep
tones
they
warble
low
like
the
glad
song
of
angels
when
they
sang
good
will
and
peace
to
men
now
faintly
heard
and
far
as
if
the
spirit
ears
had
caught
the
anthem
of
a
star
chanting
with
his
in
the
midnight
dark
and
deep
when
the
body
is
asleep
and
wondrous
shadows
pour
in
streams
from
the
twofold
gate
of
dreams
now
onward
roll
the
billows
swelling
with
a
of
might
as
of
voices
doom
foretelling
to
the
silent
ear
of
night
and
now
a
mingled
ecstasy
of
all
sweet
sounds
it
is
o
who
may
tell
the
agony
of
rapture
such
as
this
vi
i
have
drunk
of
the
drink
of
immortals
i
have
drunk
of
the
wine
and
now
i
may
pass
the
bright
portals
that
open
into
a
realm
divine
i
have
drunk
it
through
mine
ears
in
the
ecstasy
of
song
when
mine
eyes
would
fill
with
tears
that
its
life
were
not
more
long
i
have
drunk
it
through
mine
eyes
in
beauty
every
shape
and
now
around
my
soul
it
lies
no
juice
of
earthly
grape
wings
wings
are
given
to
me
i
can
flutter
i
can
rise
like
a
new
life
gushing
through
me
sweep
the
heavenly
harmonies
song
o
i
must
look
on
that
sweet
face
once
more
before
i
die
god
grant
that
it
may
lighten
up
with
joy
when
i
draw
nigh
god
grant
that
she
may
look
on
me
as
kindly
as
she
seems
in
the
long
night
the
restless
night
i
the
sunny
land
of
dreams
i
hoped
i
thought
she
loved
me
once
and
yet
i
know
not
why
there
is
a
coldness
in
her
speech
and
a
coldness
in
her
eye
something
that
in
another
look
would
not
seem
cold
to
me
and
yet
like
ice
i
feel
it
chill
the
heart
of
memory
she
does
not
come
to
greet
me
so
frankly
as
she
did
and
in
her
utmost
openness
i
feel
there
something
hid
she
almost
seems
to
shun
me
as
if
she
thought
that
i
might
win
her
gentle
heart
again
to
feelings
long
gone
by
i
sought
the
first
for
her
the
fairest
and
the
best
and
she
wore
them
for
their
loveliness
upon
her
spotless
breast
the
and
the
violet
the
frail
anemone
she
wore
them
and
alas
i
deemed
it
was
for
love
of
me
as
flowers
in
a
darksome
place
stretch
forward
to
the
light
so
to
the
memory
of
her
i
turn
by
day
and
night
as
flowers
in
a
darksome
place
grow
thin
and
pale
and
wan
so
is
it
with
my
darkened
heart
now
that
her
light
is
gone
the
thousand
little
things
that
love
doth
treasure
up
for
aye
and
brood
upon
with
moistened
eyes
when
she
that
loved
away
the
word
the
look
the
smile
the
blush
the
ribbon
that
she
wore
each
day
they
grow
more
dear
to
me
and
pain
me
more
and
more
my
face
i
cover
with
my
hands
and
bitterly
i
weep
that
the
sands
of
life
should
choke
a
love
so
deep
and
that
the
stream
so
pure
and
bright
must
turn
it
from
its
track
or
to
the
whence
it
rose
roll
its
full
waters
back
as
calm
as
doth
the
lily
float
close
by
the
lakelet
brim
so
calm
and
spotless
down
time
stream
her
peaceful
days
did
swim
and
i
had
longed
and
dreamed
and
prayed
that
closely
by
her
side
down
to
a
haven
still
and
sure
my
happy
life
might
glide
but
now
alas
those
golden
days
of
youth
and
hope
are
and
i
must
dream
those
dreams
of
joy
those
guiltless
dreams
no
more
yet
there
is
something
in
my
heart
that
whispers
ceaselessly
would
god
that
i
might
see
that
face
once
more
before
i
die
ianthe
i
there
is
a
light
within
her
eyes
like
gleams
of
wandering
from
light
to
shade
it
leaps
and
moves
whenever
in
her
soul
arise
the
holy
shapes
of
things
she
loves
fitful
it
shines
and
changes
ever
like
ripples
on
a
river
or
summer
sunshine
on
the
eaves
of
poplar
leaves
where
the
lingering
quiver
i
may
not
tell
the
blessedness
her
mild
eyes
send
to
mine
the
haziness
of
their
mysterious
shine
the
dim
and
holy
mournfulness
of
their
mellow
light
divine
the
shadow
of
the
lashes
lie
over
them
so
lovingly
that
they
seem
to
melt
away
in
a
doubtful
while
i
watch
the
stars
arise
in
the
evening
of
her
eyes
i
love
it
yet
i
almost
dread
to
think
what
it
foreshadoweth
and
when
i
muse
how
i
have
read
that
such
strange
light
betokened
death
instead
of
gleams
i
see
wild
gliding
waveringly
ii
with
wayward
thoughts
her
eyes
are
bright
like
shiftings
of
the
hither
thither
swiftly
glance
they
in
a
mazy
twining
dance
they
like
ripply
lights
the
sunshine
weaves
thrown
backward
from
a
shaken
nook
below
some
tumbling
on
the
all
through
her
glowing
face
they
flit
and
rest
in
their
deep
those
fathomless
blue
eyes
of
hers
till
from
her
burning
soul
while
her
upheaving
bosom
stirs
they
stream
again
across
her
face
and
with
such
hope
and
glory
fill
it
death
could
not
have
the
heart
to
chill
it
yet
when
their
wild
light
fades
again
i
feel
a
sudden
sense
of
pain
as
if
while
yet
her
eyes
were
gleaming
and
like
a
shower
of
rain
bright
fancies
from
her
face
were
streaming
her
trembling
soul
might
flit
away
as
swift
and
suddenly
as
they
iii
a
wild
inspirèd
earnestness
her
inmost
being
fills
and
eager
that
speaks
not
what
it
wills
but
what
unto
her
soul
is
given
a
living
oracle
from
heaven
which
scarcely
in
her
breast
is
born
when
on
her
trembling
lips
it
thrills
and
like
a
burst
of
golden
skies
through
on
a
sudden
torn
like
a
glory
of
the
morn
beams
marvellously
from
her
eyes
and
then
like
a
river
roll
the
deep
waves
of
her
thought
crested
with
spray
her
wild
lips
curve
and
quiver
and
my
rapt
soul
on
the
strong
tide
upcaught
unwittingly
is
borne
away
lulled
by
a
dreamful
music
ever
far
through
the
solemn
of
hoary
woods
through
valleys
green
which
the
trailing
vine
embowers
and
where
the
grapes
are
seen
through
rich
clumps
of
waving
flowers
now
over
foaming
rapids
swept
and
with
maddening
rapture
shook
now
gliding
where
the
have
slept
for
ages
in
a
nook
enwoven
by
a
band
of
dreams
i
float
to
a
delicious
land
by
a
sunset
heaven
spanned
and
musical
with
streams
around
the
calm
majestic
forms
and
eyes
of
early
greece
i
see
or
listen
till
my
spirit
warms
to
songs
of
courtly
chivalry
or
weep
unmindful
if
my
tears
be
seen
for
the
meek
suffering
love
of
poor
undine
iv
her
thoughts
are
never
memories
but
ever
changeful
ever
new
fresh
and
beautiful
as
dew
that
in
a
dell
at
noontide
lies
or
at
the
close
of
summer
day
the
pleasant
breath
of
hay
swiftly
they
come
and
pass
as
golden
birds
across
the
sun
as
on
tall
which
the
wind
just
breathes
upon
and
when
she
speaks
her
eyes
i
see
through
their
silken
lattices
like
stars
that
quiver
tremblingly
through
leafy
branches
of
the
trees
and
her
pale
cheeks
do
flush
and
glow
with
speaking
flashes
bright
and
rare
as
crimson
on
snow
from
out
the
veiling
of
her
hair
her
careless
hair
that
scatters
down
on
either
side
her
eyes
a
waterfall
with
brown
and
lit
with
the
sunrise
when
first
i
saw
her
not
of
earth
but
heavenly
both
in
grief
and
mirth
i
thought
her
she
did
seem
as
fair
and
full
of
mystery
as
bodiless
as
forms
we
see
in
the
rememberings
of
a
dream
a
mist
a
strange
dim
light
circled
her
spirit
from
my
sight
each
day
more
beautiful
she
grew
more
earthly
every
day

that
mysterious
moony
hue
faded

all
away

all
the
wanderers

her

round
her
fell

moon

loveth
her
she
loveth
it
as
well
and
of
their
love
perchance
this
grace
was
born
into
her
wondrous
face

can
not
tell
how
it
may
be
for
both
methinks
can
scarce
be
true
still
as
she
earthly
grew
to
me
she
grew
more
heavenly
too
she
seems
one
born
in
heaven
with
earthly
feelings
for
while
unto
her
soul
are
given
more
pure
revealings
of
holiest
love
and
truth
yet
is
the
mildness
of
her
eyes
made
up
of
quickest
sympathies
of
kindliness
and
ruth
so
though
some
shade
of
awe
doth
stir
our
souls
for
one
so
far
above
us
we
feel
secure
that
she
will
love
us
and
can
not
keep
from
loving

me

their
eyes
watching
the
growth
of
destinies
calm
sedate
the
eyes
of
fate
they
wink
not
nor
do
roll
but
search
the
depths
of
soul
and
in
those
mighty
depths
they
see
the
germs
of
all
futurity
waiting
but
the
fitting
time
to
burst
and
ripen
into
prime
as
in
the
womb
of
mother
earth
the
seeds
of
plants

age
upon

never

so
in

undyingly
the

chance

the

and
forth
they
spring
filling

with

i

i
look
into
those
mighty

great

all

all

are

of

love
is
knowledge
of
beauty
passing
dear
is
each
to
each
and
mutually
each
one
doth
make
the
other
clear
beauty
is
love
and
what
we
love
straightway
is
beautiful
so
is
the
circle
round
and
full
and
so
dear
love
doth
live
and
move
and
have
his
being
finding
his
proper
food
by
sure
inseeing
in
all
things
pure
and
good
which
he
at
will
doth
cull
like
a
joyous
butterfly
hiving
in
the
sunny
bowers
of
the
soul
fairest
flowers
or
between
the
earth
and
sky
wandering
at
liberty
for
happy
happy
hours
the
thoughts
of
love
are
poesy
as
this
fair
earth
and
all
we
see
are
the
thoughts
of
deity
and
love
is
ours
by
our
birthright
he
hath
cleared
mine
inward
sight
glorious
shapes
with
glorious
eyes
round
about
my
spirit
glance
shedding
a
mild
and
golden
light
on
the
shadowy
face
of
night
to
unearthly
melodies
hand
in
hand
they
weave
their
dance
while
a
deep
ambrosial
lustre
from
their
rounded
limbs
doth
shine
through
many
a
rich
and
golden
cluster
of
streaming
hair
divine
in
our
gross
and
earthly
hours
we
can
not
see
the
powers
which
ever
round
the
soul
await
to
do
its
sovereign
will
when
in
its
moments
calm
and
still
it
its
royal
state
nor
longer
sits
with
eyes
downcast
a
beggar
dreaming
of
the
past
at
its
own
vi
i
too
am
a
maker
and
a
poet
through
my
whole
soul
i
feel
it
and
know
it
my
veins
are
fired
with
ecstasy
earth
did
give
birth
to
one
who
shall
be
matched
with
me
the
lustre
of
my
coronal
shall
cast
a
dimness
over
alas
alas
what
have
i
spoken
my
strong
my
eagle
wings
are
broken
and
back
again
to
earth
i
fall
something
natural
i
when
first
i
saw
thy
eyes
my
heart
yearned
to
thee
instantly
strange
longing
in
my
soul
did
rise
i
can
not
tell
the
reason
why
but
i
must
love
thee
till
i
die
ii
the
sight
of
thee
hath
grown
as
needful
to
me
as
the
light
i
am
unrestful
when
alone
and
my
heart
doth
not
beat
aright
except
it
dwell
within
thy
sight
iii
and
yet
and
yet
o
selfish
love
i
am
not
happy
even
with
thee
i
see
thee
in
thy
brightness
move
and
can
not
well
contented
be
save
thou
shine
alone
for
me
iv
we
should
love
beauty
even
as
flowers
for
all
is
said
they
bud
and
blow
they
are
the
world
as
well
as
ours
but
thou
alas
god
made
thee
grow
so
fair
i
can
not
love
thee
so
a
feeling
the
flowers
and
the
grass
to
me
are
eloquent
reproachfully
for
would
they
wave
so
pleasantly
or
look
so
fresh
and
fair
if
a
man
cunning
hollow
mean
or
one
in
anywise
unclean
were
looking
on
them
there
no
he
hath
grown
so
he
can
not
see
with
childhood
eyes
he
hath
forgot
that
purity
and
lowliness
which
are
the
key
of
nature
mysteries
no
he
hath
wandered
off
so
long
from
his
own
place
of
birth
that
he
hath
lost
his
and
like
one
come
from
lands
forgetting
and
forgot
he
stands
beside
his
mother
hearth
the
lost
child
i
wandered
down
the
sunny
glade
and
ever
mused
my
love
of
thee
my
thoughts
like
little
children
played
as
gayly
and
as
guilelessly
ii
if
any
chanced
to
go
astray
moaning
in
fear
of
coming
harms
hope
brought
the
wanderer
back
alway
safe
nestled
in
her
snowy
arms
iii
from
that
soft
nest
the
happy
one
looked
up
at
me
and
calmly
smiled
its
hair
shone
golden
in
the
sun
and
made
it
seem
a
heavenly
child
iv
dear
hope
blue
eyes
smiled
mildly
down
and
blest
it
with
a
love
so
deep
that
like
a
nursling
of
her
own
it
clasped
her
neck
and
fell
asleep
the
church
i
love
the
rites
of
england
church
i
love
to
hear
and
see
the
priest
and
people
reading
slow
the
solemn
litany
i
love
to
hear
the
glorious
swell
of
chanted
psalm
and
prayer
and
the
deep
organ
bursting
heart
throb
through
the
shivering
air
ii
chants
that
a
thousand
years
have
heard
i
love
to
hear
again
for
visions
of
the
olden
time
are
wakened
by
the
strain
with
gorgeous
hues
the
seems
suddenly
to
glow
and
rich
and
red
the
streams
of
light
down
through
the
chancel
flow
iii
and
then
i
murmur
surely
god
delighteth
here
to
dwell
this
is
the
temple
of
his
son
whom
he
doth
love
so
well
but
when
i
hear
the
creed
which
saith
this
church
alone
is
his
i
feel
within
my
soul
that
he
hath
purer
shrines
than
this
iv
for
his
is
not
the
builded
church
nor
dome
in
every
thing
that
lovely
is
he
loves
and
hath
his
home
and
most
in
soul
that
loveth
well
all
things
which
he
hath
made
knowing
no
creed
but
simple
faith
that
may
not
be
gainsaid
his
church
is
universal
love
and
whoso
dwells
therein
shall
need
no
customed
sacrifice
to
wash
away
his
sin
and
music
in
its
aisles
shall
swell
of
lives
upright
and
true
sweet
as
dreamed
sounds
of
through
the
blue
vi
they
shall
not
ask
a
litany
the
souls
that
worship
there
but
every
look
shall
be
a
hymn
and
every
word
a
prayer
their
service
shall
be
written
bright
in
calm
and
holy
eyes
and
every
day
from
fragrant
hearts
fit
incense
shall
arise
the
unlovely
the
pretty
things
that
others
wear
look
strange
and
out
of
place
on
me
i
never
seem
dressed
tastefully
because
i
am
not
fair
and
when
i
would
most
pleasing
seem
and
deck
myself
with
joyful
care
i
find
it
is
an
idle
dream
because
i
am
not
fair
if
i
put
roses
in
my
hair
they
bloom
as
if
in
mockery
nature
denies
her
sympathy
because
i
am
not
fair
alas
i
have
a
warm
true
heart
but
when
i
show
it
people
stare
i
must
forever
dwell
apart
because
i
am
not
fair
i
am
least
happy
being
where
the
hearts
of
others
are
most
light
and
strive
to
keep
me
out
of
sight
because
i
am
not
fair
the
glad
ones
often
give
a
glance
as
i
am
sitting
lonely
there
that
asks
me
why
i
do
not
dance
because
i
am
not
fair
and
if
to
smile
on
them
i
dare
for
that
my
heart
with
love
runs
they
say
what
is
she
laughing
for
because
i
am
not
fair
love
scorned
or
misinterpreted
it
is
the
hardest
thing
to
bear
i
often
wish
that
i
were
dead
because
i
am
not
fair
in
joy
or
grief
i
must
not
share
for
neither
smiles
nor
tears
on
me
will
ever
look
becomingly
because
i
am
not
fair
whole
days
i
sit
alone
and
cry
and
in
my
grave
i
wish
i
were
yet
none
will
weep
me
if
i
die
because
i
am
not
fair
my
grave

be
so
lone

bare
i
fear
to
think
of
those
dark
hours
for
none
will
plant
it
with
flowers
because
i
am
not

they
will
not
in
the
summer
come
and
speak
kind
words

with
the

whole

all
things
are
sad
i
go
and
ask
of
memory
that
she
tell
sweet
tales
to
me
to
make
me
glad
and
she
takes
me
by
the
hand
leadeth
to
old
places
showeth
the
old
faces
in
her
hazy
o
her
voice
is
sweet
and
low
and
her
eyes
are
fresh
to
mine
as
the
dew
gleaming
through
the
eglantine
long
ago
long
ago
but
i
feel
that
i
am
only
yet
more
sad
and
yet
more
lonely
then
i
turn
to
hope
and
beg
of
her
that
she
will
ope
her
golden
gates
for
me
she
is
fair
and
full
of
grace
but
she
hath
the
form
and
face
of
her
mother
memory
clear
as
air
her
glad
voice
ringeth
joyous
are
the
songs
she
singeth
yet
i
hear
them
mournfully
they
are
songs
her
mother
taught
her
crooning
to
her
infant
daughter
as
she
lay
upon
her
knee
many
little
ones
she
bore
me
woe
is
me
in
hours
who
danced
along
and
sang
before
me
scattering
my
way
with
flowers
one
by
one
they
are
gone
and
their
silent
graves
are
seen
shining
fresh
with
mosses
green
where
the
rising
sunbeams
slope
the
dewy
land
of
hope
but
when
sweet
memory
faileth
and
hope
looks
strange
and
cold
when
youth
no
more
availeth
and
grief
grows
over
bold
when
softest
winds
are
dreary
and
summer
sunlight
weary
and
sweetest
things
uncheery
we
know
not
why
when
the
crown
of
our
desires
weighs
upon
the
brow
and
tires
and
we
would
die
die
for
ah
we
know
not
what
something
we
seem
to
have
forgot
something
we
had
and
now
have
not
when
the
present
is
a
weight
and
the
future
seems
our
foe
and
with
shrinking
eyes
we
wait
as
one
who
dreads
a
sudden
blow
in
the
dark
he
knows
not
whence
when
love
at
last
his
bright
eye
closes
and
the
bloom
upon
his
face
that
lends
him
such
a
living
grace
is
a
shadow
from
the
roses
wherewith
we
have
decked
his
bier
because
he
once
was
passing
dear
when
we
feel
a
leaden
sense
of
nothingness
and
impotence
till
we
grow
mad
then
the
body
saith
there

all

pleasant
thoughts
come
wandering
when
thou
art
far
from
thee
to
me
on
their
silver
wings
they
bring
a
very
peaceful
ecstasy
a
feeling
of
eternal
spring
so
that
winter
half
forgets
everything
but
that
thou
art
and
in
his
bewildered
heart
dreameth
of
the
violets

those
bluer
flowers
that
ope
flowers
of
steadfast
love
and
hope
watered
by
the
living
wells
of

dear
and

when
young
spring
forever

thine

thee

such
dreams

when
i

no

darker
seems
through
the

from

far
away
in

deep
poised
upon

shining
wings
over
us
his
watch
doth
keep
and
as
he
watcheth
ever
sings
through
the
still
night
i
hear
him
sing
on
our
sleep
i
hear
his
clear
clear
ring
and
as
the
golden
notes
take
wing
gently
downward
hovering
for
very
joy
i
weep
he
singeth
songs
of
holy
love
that
quiver
through
the
depths
afar
where
the
blessèd
spirits
are
and
lingeringly
from
above

till
the
morning

shield
hath
buckled
on

sentinels
the
dawn

quivering
his
gleamy
spear
through

the

shall
cease

break
for

thus

it
with

is
the
strip
of
bark
the
shower
of
rain
and
so
they
are
not
wholly
crushed
with
pain
but
live
and
linger
on
far
sadder
sight
to
see
much
do
they
err
who
tell
us
that
the
heart
may
not
be
broken
what
then
can
we
call
a
broken
heart
if
this
may
not
be
so
this
death
in

when
shrouded
in
its
pall
shunning
and

dwelleth
all
apart

o
let
it
not

with
thee
my

of
good
courage
bear
up
to
the
end

on
thine

all

would
know

crown
is
oft
a
crown
of
thorns
whence
trickling
down
blood
mixed
with
tears
blinding
her
eyes
doth
flow
but
time
a
gentle
nurse
shall
wipe
away
this
bloody
sweat
and
thou
shalt
find
on
earth
that
woman
is
not
all
in
all
to
love
but
living
by
a
new
and
second
birth
thy
soul
shall
see
all
things
below

grow
bright
and
brighter
to
the
perfect
day
o
child
of
nature
o
most
meek
and
free
most
gentle
spirit
of
true
nobleness
thou
doest
not
a
worthy
deed
the
less
because
the
world
may
not
its
greatness
see
what
were
a
thousand
triumphings
to
thee
who
in
thyself
art
as
a
perfect
sphere
wrapt
in
a
bright
and
natural
atmosphere
of
and
majesty
thy
soul
is
not
too
high
for
lowly
things
feels
not
its
strength
seeing
its
brother
weak
not
for
itself
unto
itself
is
dear
but
for
that
it
may
guide
the
wanderings
of
and
to
their
spirits
speak
the
lofty
faith
of
heart
that
knows
no
fear
vi
to
deem
it
no
of
vanity
or
fickle
fantasy
of
unripe
youth
which
ever
takes
the
fairest
shows
for
truth
that
i
should
wish
my
verse
beloved
of
thee
is
love
deep
thirst
which
may
not
quenchèd
be
there
is
a
gulf
of
longing
and
unrest
a
wild
not
to
be
represt
whereto
in
all
our
hearts
as
to
the
sea
the
streams
of
feeling
do
forever
flow
therefore
it
is
that
thy
praise
falleth
so
and
fresh
on
me
filling
those
springs
which
else
had
sunk
full
low
lost
in
the
dreary
of
woe
or
parched
by
passion
fierce
and
withering
blaze
vii
might
i
but
be
beloved
and
o
most
fair
and
soul
beloved
of
thee
how
should
i
feel
a
cloud
of
earthly
care
if
thy
blue
eyes
were
ever
clear
to
me
o
woman
love
o
flower
most
bright
and
rare
that
brightest
in
extremest
need
woe
woe
is
me
that
thy
so
precious
seed
is
ever
sown
by
fancy
changeful
air
and
grows
sometimes
in
poor
and
barren
hearts
who
can
be
little
even
in
the
light
of
thy
meek
holiness
while
souls
more
great
are
left
to
wander
in
a
starless
night
praying
unheard
and
yet
the
hardest
parts
befit
those
best
who
best
can
cope
with
fate
viii
why
should
we
ever
weary
of
this
life
our
souls
should
widen
ever
not
contract
grow
stronger
and
not
harder
in
the
strife
filling
each
moment
with
a
noble
act
if
we
live
thus
of
vigor
all
compact
doing
our
duty
to
our
and
striving
rather
to
exalt
our
race
than
our
poor
selves
with
earnest
hand
or
pen
we
shall
erect
our
names
a
which
not
all
ages
shall
cast
down
agen
offspring
of

then
be

the

would
fain
its

custom

heart

hollow
crowds

up

gushing
love

swell

fearful
still

words
come
grating
as
a
jangled
bell
o
might
we
only
speak

what
we
feel
might
the
tongue
pay
but
what
the

doth
owe

softer

shed

dropt
upon

they

nothing

without

i
lifted
up
my
head

lo
that
writing
was
not
one
fair
word
was
carven
in
its

it
was

on

much
i
had
mused
of
love

in
my
soul
there
was
one
chamber

i
dared
not

its
dark
and
dreary
voidness
shook
my
spirit

that
i
was
not

all
my
deep
longings
flowed
toward
one
goal
for
long
long
years

were
not
answerèd
till
hope
was
drooping

i
was
still
a
blind
mole

did
i
know
that
god
was
wise
and
good
and
would
fulfil
my
being
late
or
soon
nor
was
such
thought
in

for
seeing
thee
great
love
rose
up
as
a
black
pine

round
bright
and
clear
upstarteth
the
full

my

light
of
mine
eyes
with
thy
so
trusting
look
and
thy
sweet
smile
of
charity
and
love
that
from
a
treasure
well
uplaid
above
and
from
a
hope
in
christ
its
blessing
took
light
of
my
heart
which
when
it
could
not
brook
the
coldness
of
another

finds
ever
a
deep
peace
and
stay
in
thee
warm
as
the
sunshine

a
mossy
nook
light
of
my
soul
who
by
thy
saintliness
and
faith
that
acts
itself
in
daily
life
canst
raise
me
above
weakness

canst
bless
the
hardest
thraldom

dare
not

how
much
thou
art
to
me

xxiii
silent
as
one
who
treads
on
snow
love
came
upon
me
ere
i
was
aware
not
light
of
heart
for
there
was
troublous
care
upon
his
eyelids
drooping
them
full
low
as
with
sad
memory
of
a
healèd
woe
the
cold
rain
shivered
in
his
golden
hair
as
if
an
outcast
lot
had
been
his
share
and
he
seemed
doubtful
whither
he
should
go
then
he
fell
on
my
neck
and
in
my
breast
hiding
his
face
awhile
sobbed
bitterly
as
half
in
grief
to
be
so
long
distrest
and
half
in
joy
at
his
security
at
last
uplooking
from
his
place
of
rest
his
eyes
shone
blessedness
and
hope
on
me
xxiv
a
gentleness
that
grows
of
steady
faith
a
joy
that
sheds
its
sunshine
everywhere
a
humble
strength
and
readiness
to
bear
those
burthens
which
strict
duty
ever
upon
our
souls
which
unto
sorrow
saith
here
is
no
soil
for
thee
to
strike
thy
roots
here
only
grow
those
sweet
and
precious
fruits
which
ripen
for
the
soul
that
well
a
patience
which
the
world
can
neither
give
nor
take
away
a
courage
strong
and
high
that
dares
in
simple
usefulness
to
live
and
without
one
sad
look
behind
to
die
when
that
day
comes
these
tell
me
that
our
love
is
building
for
itself
a
home
above
xxv
when
the
glad
soul
is
full
to
overflow
unto
the
tongue
all
power
it
denies
and
only
trusts
its
secret
to
the
eyes
for
by
an
inborn
wisdom
it
doth
know
there
is
no
other
eloquence
but
so
and
when
the
tongue
weak
utterance
doth
suffice
prisoned
within
the
body
cell
it
lies
remembering
in
tears
its
exiled
woe
that
word
which
all
mankind
so
long
to
hear
which
bears
the
spirit
back
to
whence
it
came
maketh
this
sullen
clay
as
crystal
clear
and
will
not
be
enclouded
in
a
name
it
is
a
truth
which
we
can
feel
and
see
but
is
as
boundless
as
eternity
xxvi
to
the
when
we
have
once
said
lowly
words

no
more
for
in
thy
silver
pride
thou
shinest
as
naught
else
can
shine
beside
the
thick
smoke
coiling
round
the
sooty
bar
forever
and
the
customed
mar
the
stillness
of
my
thought
seeing
things
glide
so
samely
then
i
ope
my
windows
wide
and
gaze
in
peace
to
where
thou
afar
the
wind
that
comes
across
the
snow
so
freshly
and
the
river
dimly
seen
seem
like
new
things
that
never
had
been
so
before
and
thou
art
bright
as
thou
hast
been
since
thy
white
rays
put
sweetness
in
the
eyes
of
the
first
souls
that

been
that
round

my
guarding

fold
rose
my
rose

always
speakest

and

thy
full

as
right
from
the

down
to
the
heart
it
goes
and
says
i

as
who
but
knows
thy

reminds
me
of
old
romping
days
of
kisses
stolen
in
dark
or
in
the
parlor

the
gave

drowsy
watch

wonder
where
are
gone
thy
tokens
given
with
a
glance
so
full
of
everlasting
love
till
morrow
or
a
day
endless
grieving
for
the
dance
last
night
denied
backed
with
a
lock
of
hair
that
spake
of
broken
hearts
and
deadly
sorrow
mary
dark
hair
dark
eyes
not
too
dark
to
be
deep
and
full
of
feeling
yet
enough
to
glow
with
fire
when
angered
feelings
never
slow
but
which
seem
rather
watching
to
forthleap
from
her
full
breast
a
sweep
of
words
in
common
talk
a
whenever
through
her
soul
swift
feelings
gush
a
heart
less
ready
to
be
gay
than
weep
yet
cheerful
ever
a
calm
that
bids
god
bless
you
a
chaste
simpleness
with
somewhat
too
of
proper
pride
in
dress
this
portrait
to
my
mind
eye
came
the
while
i
thought
of
thee
the
woman
mary
whilome
a
laughing
little
fairy
caroline
a
staidness
sobers
her
pretty
face
which
something
but
in
her
eyes
and
a
quaint
look
about
her
lips
denies
a
lingering
love
of
girlhood
you
can
trace
in
her
checked
laugh
and
pace
and
when
she
bears
herself
most
womanly
it
seems
as
if
a
watchful
mother
eye
kept
down
with
sobering
glance
her
childish
grace
yet
oftentimes
her
nature
gushes
free
as
water
long
held
back
by
little
hands
within
a
pump
and
let
forth
suddenly
until
her
task
remembering
she
stands
a
moment
silent
smiling
doubtfully
then
laughs
aloud
and
scorns
her
hated
bands
anne
there
is
a
pensiveness
in
quiet
anne
a
mournful
drooping
of
the
full
gray
eye
as
if
she
had
shook
hands
with
misery
and
known
some
care
since
her
short
life
began
her
cheek
is
seriously
pale
nigh
wan
and
though
of
cheerfulness
there
is
no
lack
you
feel
as
if
she
must
be
dressed
in
black
yet
is
she
not
of
those
who
all
they
can
strive
to
be
gay
and
striving
seem
most
sad
hers
is
not
grief
but
silent
soberness
you
would
be
startled
if
you
saw
her
glad
and
startled
if
you
saw
her
weep
no
less
she
walks
through
life
as
on
the
sabbath
day
she
decorously
glides
to
church
to
pray
miscellaneous
poems
threnodia
gone
gone
from
us
and
shall
we
see
these
of
destiny
those
calm
eyes
nevermore
those
deep
dark
eyes
so
warm
and
bright
wherein
the
fortunes
of
the
man
lay
slumbering
in
prophetic
light
in
characters
a
child
might
scan
so
bright
and
gone
forth
utterly
o
stern
word
nevermore
the
stars
of
those
two
gentle
eyes
will
shine
no
more
on
earth
quenched
are
the
hopes
that
had
their
birth
as
we
watched
them
slowly
rise
stars
of
a
mother
fate
and
she
would
read
them
and
pondering
as
she
sate
over
their
dear
astrology
which
she
had
conned
and
conned
before
deeming
she
needs
must
read
aright
what
was
writ
so
passing
bright
and
yet
alas
she
knew
not
why
her
voice
would
falter
in
its
song
and
tears
would
slide
from
out
her
eye
silent
as
they
were
doing
wrong
o
stern
word
nevermore
the
tongue
that
scarce
had
learned
to
claim
an
entrance
to
a
mother
heart
by
that
dear
talisman
a
mother
name
sleeps
all
forgetful
of
its
art
i
loved
to
see
the
infant
soul
how
mighty
in
the
weakness
of
its
untutored
meekness
peep
timidly
from
out
its
nest
his
lips
the
while
fluttering
with
words
or
hushing
to
a
smile
that
more
than
words
expressed
when
his
glad
mother
on
him
stole
and
snatched
him
to
her
breast
o
thoughts
were
brooding
in
those
eyes
that
would
have
soared
like
birds
far
far
into
the
skies
gladding
the
earth
with
song
and
gushing
harmonies
had
he
but
tarried
with
us
long
o
stern
word
nevermore
how
peacefully
they
rest
crossfolded
there
upon
his
little
breast
those
small
white
hands
that
were
still
before
but
ever
sported
with
his
mother
hair
or
the
plain
cross
that
on
her
breast
she
wore
her
heart
no
more
will
beat
to
feel
the
touch
of
that
soft
palm
that
ever
seemed
a
new
surprise
sending
glad
thoughts
up
to
her
eyes
to
bless
him
with
their
holy
calm
sweet
thoughts
they
made
her
eyes
as
sweet
how
quiet
are
the
hands
that
wove
those
pleasant
bands
but
that
they
do
not
rise
and
sink
with
his
calm
breathing
i
should
think
that
he
were
dropped
asleep
alas
too
deep
too
deep
is
this
his
slumber
time
scarce
can
number
the
years
ere
he
will
wake
again
o
may
we
see
his
eyelids
open
then
o
stern
word
nevermore
as
the
airy
gossamere
floating
in
the
sunlight
clear
it
toucheth
clingeth
tightly
round
glossy
leaf
or
stump
unsightly
so
from
his
spirit
wandered
out
tendrils
spreading
all
about
knitting
all
things
to
its
thrall
with
a
perfect
love
of
all
o
stern
word
nevermore
he
did
but
float
a
little
way
adown
the
stream
of
time
with
dreamy
eyes
watching
the
ripples
play
or
listening
their
fairy
chime
his
slender
sail
felt
the
gale
he
did
but
float
a
little
way
and
putting
to
the
shore
while
yet
was
early
day
went
calmly
on
his
way
to
dwell
with
us
no
more
no
jarring
did
he
feel
no
grating
on
his
vessel
keel
a
strip
of
silver
sand
mingled
the
waters
with
the
land
where
he
was
seen
no
more
o
stern
word
nevermore
full
short
his
journey
was
no
dust
of
earth
unto
his
sandals
clave
the
weary
weight
that
old
men
must
he
bore
not
to
the
grave
he
seemed
a
cherub
who
had
lost
his
way
and
wandered
hither
so
his
stay
with
us
was
short
and
was
most
meet
that
he
should
be
no
delver
in
earth
clod
nor
need
to
pause
and
cleanse
his
feet
to
stand
before
his
god
o
blest
word
evermore
the
sirens
the
sea
is
lonely
the
sea
is
dreary
the
sea
is
restless
and
uneasy
thou
seekest
quiet
thou
art
weary
wandering
thou
knowest
not
whither
our
little
isle
is
green
and
breezy
come
and
rest
thee
o
come
hither
come
to
this
peaceful
home
of
ours
where
evermore
the
low
creeps
panting
up
the
shore
to
be
at
rest
among
the
flowers
full
of
rest
the
green
moss
lifts
as
the
dark
waves
of
the
sea
draw
in
and
out
of
rocky
rifts
calling
solemnly
to
thee
with
voices
deep
and
hollow
to
the
shore
follow
o
follow
to
be
at
rest
forevermore
forevermore
look
how
the
gray
old
ocean
from
the
depth
of
his
heart
rejoices
heaving
with
a
gentle
motion
when
he
hears
our
restful
voices
list
how
he
sings
in
an
chiming
with
our
melody
and
all
sweet
sounds
of
earth
and
air
melt
into
one
low
voice
alone
that
murmurs
over
the
weary
sea
and
seems
to
sing
from
everywhere
here
mayst
thou
harbor
peacefully
here
mayst
thou
rest
from
the
aching
oar
turn
thy
curvèd
prow
ashore
and
in
our
green
isle
rest
for
evermore
forevermore
and
echo
half
wakes
in
the
wooded
hill
and
to
her
heart
so
calm
and
deep
murmurs
over
in
her
sleep
doubtfully
pausing
and
murmuring
still
evermore
thus
on
life
weary
sea
heareth
the
marinere
voices
sweet
from
far
and
near
ever
singing
low
and
clear
ever
singing
longingly
is
it
not
better
here
to
be
than
to
be
toiling
late
and
soon
in
the
dreary
night
to
see
nothing
but
the
moon
go
up
and
down
into
the
sea
or
in
the
loneliness
of
day
to
see
the
still
seals
only
solemnly
lift
their
faces
gray
making
it
yet
more
lonely
is
it
not
better
than
to
hear
only
the
sliding
of
the
wave
beneath
the
plank
and
feel
so
near
a
cold
and
lonely
grave
a
restless
grave
where
thou
shalt
lie
even
in
death
unquietly
look
down
beneath
thy
bark
lean
over
the
side
and
see
the
leaden
eye
of
the
sidelong
shark
upturnèd
patiently
ever
waiting
there
for
thee
look
down
and
see
those
shapeless
forms
which
ever
keep
their
dreamless
sleep
far
down
within
the
gloomy
deep
and
only
stir
themselves
in
storms
rising
like
islands
from
beneath
and
snorting
through
the
angry
spray
as
the
frail
vessel
perisheth
in
the
whirls
of
their
unwieldy
play
look
down
look
down
upon
the
seaweed
slimy
and
dark
that
waves
its
arms
so
lank
and
brown
beckoning
for
thee
look
down
beneath
thy
bark
into
the
cold
depth
of
the
sea
look
down
look
down
thus
on
life
lonely
sea
heareth
the
marinere
voices
sad
from
far
and
near
ever
singing
full
of
fear
ever
singing
drearfully
here
all
is
pleasant
as
a
dream
the
wind
scarce
shaketh
down
the
dew
the
green
grass
floweth
like
a
stream
into
the
ocean
blue
listen
o
listen
here
is
a
gush
of
many
streams
a
song
of
many
birds
and
every
wish
and
longing
seems
lulled
to
a
numbered
flow
of
words
listen
o
listen
here
ever
hum
the
golden
bees
underneath
trees
at
once
with
glowing
fruit
and
flowers
crowned
the
sand
is
so
smooth
the
yellow
sand
that
thy
keel
will
not
grate
as
it
touches
the
land
all
around
with
a
slumberous
sound
the
singing
waves
slide
up
the
strand
and
there
where
the
smooth
wet
pebbles
be
the
waters
gurgle
longingly
as
if
they
fain
would
seek
the
shore
to
be
at
rest
from
the
ceaseless
roar
to
be
at
rest
forevermore
forevermore
thus
on
life
gloomy
sea
heareth
the
marinere
voices

from

peace
for
thee
irené
hers
is
a
spirit
deep
and
calmly
beneath
her
earnest
face
it
lies
free
without
boldness
meek
without
a
fear
quicker
to
look
than
speak
its
sympathies
far
down
into
her
large
and
patient
eyes
i

of
the
infinite
as
in
the
of
a
clear
still
night
i

into
the
fathomless

circled
lives
she
with
love
holy
light
that
from
the
shade
of
self
she
walketh
free
the
garden
of
her
soul
still
keepeth
she
an
eden
where
the
snake
did
never
enter
she
hath
a
natural
wise
sincerity
a
simple
truthfulness
and
these
have
lent
her
a
dignity
as
moveless
as
the
centre
so
that
no
influence
of
earth
can
stir
her
steadfast
courage
nor
can
take
away
the
holy
peacefulness
which
night
and
day
unto
her
queenly
soul
doth
minister
most
gentle
is
she
her
large
charity
an
all
unwitting
gift
in
her
not
freer
is
to
give
than
meek
to
bear
and
though
herself
not
unacquaint
with
care
hath
in
her
heart
wide
room
for
all
that
be
her
heart
that
hath
no
secrets
of
its
own
but
open
is
as
eglantine
full
blown
cloudless
forever
is
her
brow
serene
speaking
calm
hope
and
trust
within
her
whence
welleth
a
noiseless
spring
of
patience
that
keepeth
all
her
life
so
fresh
so
green
and
full
of
holiness
that
every
look
the
greatness
of
her
woman
soul
revealing
unto
me
bringeth
blessing
and
a
feeling
as
when
i
read
in
god
own
holy
book
a
graciousness
in
giving
that
doth
make
the
gift
greatest
and
a
sense
most
meek
of
worthiness
that
doth
not
fear
to
take
from
others
but
which
always
fears
to
speak
its
thanks
in
utterance
for
the
giver
sake
the
deep
religion
of
a
thankful
heart
which
rests
instinctively
in
heaven
law
with
a
full
peace
that
never
can
depart
from
its
own
steadfastness
a
holy
awe
for
holy
things
not
those
which
men
call
holy
but
such
as
are
revealèd
to
the
eyes
of
a
true
woman
soul
bent
down
and
lowly
before
the
face
of
daily
mysteries
a
love
that
blossoms
soon
but
ripens
slowly
to
the
full
goldenness
of
fruitful
prime
enduring
with
a
firmness
that
defies
all
shallow
tricks
of
circumstance
and
time
by
a
sure
insight
knowing
where
to
cling
and
where
it
clingeth
never
withering
these
are
irené
dowry
which
no
fate
can
shake
from
their
serene
state
sympathy
is
hers
which
chasteneth
no
less
than
loveth
scorning
to
be
bound
with
fear
of
blame
and
yet
which
ever
hasteneth
to
pour
the
balm
of
kind
looks
on
the
wound
if
they
be
wounds
which
such
sweet
teaching
makes
giving
itself
a
pang
for
others
sakes
no
want
of
faith
that
chills
with
sidelong
eye
hath
she
no
jealousy
no
levite
pride
that
passeth
by
upon
the
other
side
for
in
her
soul
there
never
dwelt
a
lie
right
from
the
hand
of
god
her
spirit
came
unstained
and
she
hath
forgotten
whence
it
came
nor
wandered
far
from
thence
but
laboreth
to
keep
her
still
the
same
near
to
her
place
of
birth
that
she
may
not
soil
her
white
raiment
with
an
earthly
spot
yet
sets
she
not
her
soul
so
steadily
above
that
she
forgets
her
ties
to
earth
but
her
whole
thought
would
almost
seem
to
be
how
to
make
glad
one
lowly
human
hearth
for
with
a
gentle
courage
she
doth
strive
in
thought
and
word
and
feeling
so
to
live
as
to
make
earth
next
heaven
and
her
heart
herein
doth
show
its
most
exceeding
worth
that
bearing
in
our
frailty
her
just
part
she
hath
not
shrunk
from
evils
of
this
life
but
hath
gone
calmly
forth
into
the
strife
and
all
its
sins
and
sorrows
hath
withstood
with
lofty
strength
of
patient
womanhood
for
this
i
love
her
great
soul
more
than
all
that
being
bound
like
us
with
earthly
thrall
she
walks
so
bright
and
therein
too
wise
too
meek
too
womanly
to
sin
like
a
lone
star
through
riven
seen
by
sailors
upon
the
sea
telling
of
rest
and
peaceful
heavens
nigh
unto
my
soul
her
soul
hath
been
her
sight
as
full
of
hope
and
calm
to
me
for
she
unto
herself
hath
builded
high
a
home
serene
wherein
to
lay
her
head
earth
noblest
thing
a
woman
perfected
serenade
from
the
windows
gleams
no
spark
the
night
is
chilly
the
night
is
dark
the
poplars
shiver
the
moan
my
hair
by
the
autumn
breeze
is
blown
under
thy
window
i
sing
alone
alone
alone
ah
woe
alone
the
darkness
is
pressing
coldly
around
the
windows
shake
with
a
lonely
sound
the
stars
are
hid
and
the
night
is
drear
the
heart
of
silence
throbs
in
thine
ear
in
thy
chamber
thou
sittest
alone
alone
alone
ah
woe
alone
the
world
is
happy
the
world
is
wide
kind
hearts
are
beating
on
every
side
ah
why
should
we
lie
so
coldly
curled
alone
in
the
shell
of
this
great
world
why
should
we
any
more
be
alone
alone
alone
ah
woe
alone
o
is
a
bitter
and
dreary
word
the
saddest
by
man
ear
ever
heard
we
each
are
young
we
each
have
a
heart
why
stand
we
ever
coldly
apart
must
we
forever
then
be
alone
alone
alone
ah
woe
alone
with
a
pressed
flower
this
little
flower
from
afar
hath
come
from
other
lands
to
thine
for
once
its
white
and
drooping
star
could
see
its
shadow
in
the
rhine
perchance
some
german
maid
hath
plucked
one
from
the
stalk
and
numbered
over
half
afraid
its
petals
in
her
evening
walk
he
loves
me
loves
me
not
she
cries
he
loves
me
more
than
earth
or
heaven
and
then
glad
tears
have
filled
her
eyes
to
find
the
number
was
uneven
and
thou
must
count
its
petals
well
because
it
is
a
gift
from
me
and
the
last
one
of
all
shall
tell
something
i
often
told
to
thee
but
here
at
home
where
we
were
born
thou
wilt
find
flowers
just
as
true
every
summer
morn
with
freshness
of
dew
for
nature
ever
kind
to
love
hath
granted
them
the
same
sweet
tongue
whether
with
german
skies
above
or
here
our
granite
rocks
among
the
beggar
a
beggar
through
the
world
am
i
from
place
to
place
i
wander
by
fill
up
my
pilgrim
scrip
for
me
for
christ
sweet
sake
and
charity
a
little
of
thy
steadfastness
rounded
with
leafy
gracefulness
old
oak
give
me
that
the
world
blasts
may
round
me
blow
and
i
yield
gently
to
and
fro
while
my
trunk
below
and
roots
unshaken
be
some
of
thy
stern
unyielding
might
enduring
still
through
day
and
night
rude
and
withering
blight
that
i
may
keep
at
bay
the
changeful
april
sky
of
chance
and
the
strong
tide
of
circumstance
give
me
old
granite
gray
some
of
thy
pensiveness
serene
some
of
thy
green
put
in
this
scrip
of
mine
that
griefs
may
fall
like
light
and
deck
me
in
a
robe
of
white
ready
to
be
an
angel
bright
o
pine
a
little
of
thy
merriment
of
thy
sparkling
light
content
give
me
my
cheerful
brook
that
i
may
still
be
full
of
glee
and
gladsomeness
i
be
though
fickle
fate
hath
prisoned
me
in
some
neglected
nook
ye
have
been
very
kind
and
good
to
me
since
i
been
in
the
wood
ye
have
gone
nigh
to
fill
my
heart
but
kind
friends
every
one
i
far
to
go
ere
set
of
sun
of
all
good
things
i
would
have
part
the
day
was
high
ere
i
could
start
and
so
my
journey
scarce
begun
heaven
help
me
how
could
i
forget
to
beg
of
thee
dear
violet
some
of
thy
modesty
that
blossoms
here
as
well
unseen
as
if
before
the
world
been
o
give
to
strengthen
me
my
love
i
not
as
all
other
women
are
is
she
that
to
my
soul
is
dear
her
glorious
fancies
come
from
far
beneath
the
silver
and
yet
her
heart
is
ever
near
ii
great
feelings
hath
she
of
her
own
which
lesser
souls
may
never
know
god
giveth
them
to
her
alone
and
sweet
they
are
as
any
tone
wherewith
the
wind
may
choose
to
blow
iii
yet
in
herself
she
dwelleth
not
although
no
home
were
half
so
fair
no
simplest
duty
is
forgot
life
hath
no
dim
and
lowly
spot
that
doth
not
in
her
sunshine
share
iv
she
doeth
little
kindnesses
which
most
leave
undone
or
despise
for
naught
that
sets
one
heart
at
ease
and
giveth
happiness
or
peace
is
in
her
eyes
she
hath
no
scorn
of
common
things
and
though
she
seem
of
other
birth
round
us
her
heart
entwines
and
clings
and
patiently
she
folds
her
wings
to
tread
the
humble
paths
of
earth
vi
blessing
she
is
god
made
her
so
and
deeds
of
weekday
holiness
fall
from
her
noiseless
as
the
snow
nor
hath
she
ever
chanced
to
know
that
aught
were
easier
than
to
bless
vii
she
is
most
fair
and
thereunto
her
life
doth
rightly
harmonize
feeling
or
thought
that
was
not
true
made
less
beautiful
the
blue
unclouded
heaven
of
her
eyes
viii
she
is
a
woman
one
in
whom
the
of
her
childish
years
hath
never
lost
its
fresh
perfume
though
knowing
well
that
life
hath
room
for
many
blights
and
many
tears
ix
i
love
her
with
a
love
as
still
as
a
broad
river
peaceful
might
which
by
high
tower
and
lowly
mill
goes
wandering
at
its
own
will
and
yet
doth
ever
flow
aright
x
and
on
its
full
deep
breast
serene
like
quiet
isles
my
duties
lie
it
flows
around
them
and
between
and
makes
them
fresh
and
fair
and
green
sweet
homes
wherein
to
live
and
die
summer
storm
untremulous
in
the
river
clear
toward
the
sky
image
hangs
the
imaged
bridge
so
still
the
air
that
i
can
hear
the
slender
clarion
of
the
unseen
midge
out
of
the
stillness
with
a
gathering
creep
like
rising
wind
in
leaves
which
now
decreases
now
lulls
now
swells
and
all
the
while
increases
the
huddling
trample
of
a
drove
of
sheep
tilts
the
loose
planks
and
then
as
gradually
ceases
in
dust
on
the
other
side
life
emblem
deep
a
confused
noise
between
two
silences
finding
at
last
in
dust
precarious
peace
on
the
wide
marsh
the
grasses
soak
up
the
sunshine
sleeps
the
brimming
tide
save
when
the
wake
in
silence
passes
of
some
slow
whose
sinuous
glide
wavers
the
long
green
sedge
shade
from
side
to
side
but
up
the
west
like
a
surge
climbs
a
great
cloud
edged
with
spray
huge
whirls
of
foam
boil
toppling
its
verge
and
falling
still
it
seems
and
yet
it
climbs
alway
suddenly
all
the
sky
is
hid
as
with
the
shutting
of
a
lid
one
by
one
great
drops
are
falling
doubtful
and
slow
down
the
pane
they
are
crookedly
crawling
and
the
wind
breathes
low
slowly
the
circles
widen
on
the
river
widen
and
mingle
one
and
all
here
and
there
the
slenderer
flowers
shiver
struck
by
an
icy
fall
now
on
the
hills
i
hear
the
thunder
mutter
the
wind
is
gathering
in
the
west
the
upturned
leaves
first
whiten
and
flutter
then
droop
to
a
fitful
rest
up
from
the
stream
with
sluggish
flap
struggles
the
gull
and
floats
away
nearer
and
nearer
rolls
the
we
shall
not
see
the
sun
go
down
now
leaps
the
wind
on
the
sleepy
marsh
and
tramples
the
grass
with
terrified
feet
the
startled
river
turns
leaden
and
harsh
you
can
hear
the
quick
heart
of
the
tempest
beat
look
look
that
livid
flash
and
instantly
follows
the
rattling
thunder
as
if
some
split
asunder
fell
splintering
with
a
ruinous
crash
on
the
earth
which
crouches
in
silence
under
and
now
a
solid
gray
wall
of
rain
shuts
off
the
landscape
mile
by
mile
for
a
breath
space
i
see
the
blue
wood
again
and
ere
the
next
the
pile
that
seemed
but
now
a
league
aloof
bursts
crackling
the
roof
against
the
windows
the
storm
comes
dashing
through
tattered
foliage
the
hail
tears
crashing
the
blue
lightning
flashes
the
rapid
hail
clashes
the
white
waves
are
tumbling
and
in
one
baffled
roar
like
the
toothless
sea
mumbling
a
shore
the
thunder
is
rumbling
and
crashing
and
crumbling
will
silence
return
never
more
hush
still
as
death
the
tempest
holds
his
breath
as
from
a
sudden
will
the
rain
stops
short
but
from
the
eaves
you
see
it
drop
and
hear
it
from
the
leaves
all
is
so
bodingly
still
again
now
now
again
plashes
the
rain
in
heavy
gouts
the
crinkled
lightning
seems
ever
brightening
and
loud
and
long
again
the
thunder
shouts
his
one
quivering
flash
one
wildering
crash
followed
by
silence
dead
and
dull
as
if
the
cloud
let
go
leapt
bodily
below
to
whelm
the
earth
in
one
mad
overthrow
and
then
a
total
lull
gone
gone
so
soon
no
more
my
fancy
there
can
shape
a
giant
in
the
air
no
more
i
see
his
streaming
hair
the
writhing
portent
of
his
form
the
pale
and
quiet
moon
makes
her
calm
forehead
bare
and
the
last
fragments
of
the
storm
like
shattered
rigging
from
a
fight
at
sea
silent
and
few
are
drifting
over
me
love
true
love
is
but
a
humble
thing
and
hath
its
food
served
up
in
earthen
ware
it
is
a
thing
to
walk
with
hand
in
hand
through
the
everydayness
of
this
world
baring
its
tender
feet
to
every
roughness
yet
letting
not
one
go
astray
from
beauty
law
of
plainness
and
content
a
simple
fireside
thing
whose
quiet
smile
can
warm
earth
poorest
hovel
to
a
home
which
when
our
autumn
cometh
as
it
must
and
life
in
the
chill
wind
shivers
bare
and
leafless
shall
still
be
blest
with
youth
in
bleak
november
and
with
thankful
heart
smile
on
its
ample
stores
of
garnered
fruit
as
full
of
sunshine
to
our
aged
eyes
as
when
it
nursed
the
blossoms
of
our
spring
such
is
true
love
which
steals
into
the
heart
with
feet
as
silent
as
the
lightsome
dawn
that
kisses
smooth
the
rough
brows
of
the
dark
and
hath
its
will
through
blissful
gentleness
not
like
a
rocket
which
with
savage
glare
whirrs
suddenly
up
then
bursts
and
leaves
the
night
painfully
quivering
on
the
dazèd
eyes
a
love
that
gives
and
takes
that
seeth
faults
not
with
eyes
like
needle
points
but
ever
looks
them
down
with
the
faith
of
meek
forgiveness
a
love
that
shall
be
new
and
fresh
each
hour
as
is
the
golden
mystery
of
sunset
or
the
sweet
coming
of
the
evening
star
alike
and
yet
most
unlike
every
day
and
seeming
ever
best
and
fairest
a
love
that
doth
not
kneel
for
what
it
seeks
but
faces
truth
and
beauty
as
their
peer
showing
its
worthiness
of
noble
thoughts
by
a
clear
sense
of
inward
nobleness
a
love
that
in
its
object
findeth
not
all
grace
and
beauty
and
enough
to
sate
its
thirst
of
blessing
but
in
all
of
good
found
there
it
sees
but
types
of
good
and
beauty
in
the
soul
of
man
and
traces
in
the
simplest
heart
that
beats
a
to
its
chosen
one
that
claims
of
it
the
rights
of
brotherhood
for
love
is
blind
but
with
the
fleshly
eye
that
so
its
inner
sight
may
be
more
clear
and
outward
shows
of
beauty
only
so
are
needful
at
the
first
as
is
a
hand
to
guide
and
to
uphold
an
infant
steps
great
spirits
need
them
not
their
earnest
look
pierces
the
body
mask
of
thin
disguise
and
beauty
ever
is
to
them
revealed
behind
the
unshapeliest
meanest
lump
of
clay
with
arms
outstretched
and
eager
face
ablaze
yearning
to
be
but
understood
and
loved
to
perdita
singing
thy
voice
is
like
a
fountain
leaping
up
in
clear
moonshine
silver
silver
ever
mounting
ever
sinking
without
thinking
to
that
brimful
heart
of
thine
every
sad
and
happy
feeling
thou
hast
had
in
bygone
years
through
thy
lips
come
stealing
stealing
clear
and
low
all
thy
smiles
and
all
thy
tears
in
thy
voice
awaken
and
sweetness
wove
of
joy
and
woe
from
their
teaching
it
hath
taken
feeling
and
music
move
together
like
a
swan
and
shadow
ever
heaving
on
a
river
in
a
day
of
cloudless
weather
it
hath
caught
a
touch
of
sadness
yet
it
is
not
sad
it
hath
tones
of
clearest
gladness
yet
it
is
not
glad
a
dim
sweet
twilight
voice
it
is
where
accustomed
blue
is
with
memories
with
starry
feelings
quivered
through
thy
voice
is
like
a
fountain
leaping
up
in
sunshine
bright
and
i
never
weary
counting
its
clear
droppings
lone
and
single
or
when
in
one
full
gush
they
mingle
shooting
in
melodious
light
thine
is
music
such
as
yields
feelings
of
old
brooks
and
fields
and
around
this
room
sheds
a
woodland
free
perfume
o
thus
forever
sing
to
me
o
thus
forever
the
green
bright
grass
of
childhood
bring
to
me
flowing
like
an
emerald
river
and
the
bright
blue
skies
above
o
sing
them
back
as
fresh
as
ever
into
the
bosom
of
my
love
the
sunshine
and
the
merriment
the
unsought
evergreen
content
of
that
never
cold
time
the
joy
that
like
a
clear
breeze
went
through
and
through
the
old
time
peace
sits
within
thine
eyes
with
white
hands
crossed
in
joyful
rest
while
through
thy
lips
and
face
arise
the
melodies
from
out
thy
breast
she
sits
and
sings
with
folded
wings
and
white
arms
crost
weep
not
for
passed
things
they
are
not
lost
the
beauty
which
the
summer
time
thine
opening
spirit
shed
the
forest
oracles
sublime
that
filled
thy
soul
with
joyous
dread
the
scent
of
every
smallest
flower
that
made
thy
heart
sweet
for
an
hour
yea
every
holy
influence
flowing
to
thee
thou
knewest
not
whence
in
thine
eyes
is
seen
fresh
as
it
hath
ever
been
promptings
of
nature
beckonings
sweet
whatever
led
thy
childish
feet
still
will
linger
unawares
the
guiders
of
thy
silver
hairs
every
look
and
every
word
which
thou
givest
forth
tell
of
the
singing
of
the
bird
whose
music
stilled
thy
boyish
play
thy
voice
is
like
a
fountain
twinkling
up
in
sharp
starlight
when
the
moon
behind
the
mountain
dims
the
low
east
with
faintest
white
ever
darkling
ever
sparkling
we
know
not
if
is
dark
or
bright
but
when
the
great
moon
hath
rolled
round
and
its
solemn
power
grows
from
behind
its
black
bound
no
spot
of
dark
the
fountain
keepeth
but
swift
as
opening
eyelids
leapeth
into
a
waving
silver
flower
the
moon
my
soul
was
like
the
sea
before
the
moon
was
made
moaning
in
vague
immensity
of
its
own
strength
afraid
unrestful
and
unstaid
through
every
rift
it
foamed
in
vain
about
its
earthly
prison
seeking
some
unknown
thing
in
pain
and
sinking
restless
back
again
for
yet
no
moon
had
risen
its
only
voice
a
vast
dumb
moan
of
utterless
anguish
speaking
it
lay
unhopefully
alone
and
lived
but
in
an
aimless
seeking
so
was
my
soul
but
full
of
unrest
to
a
voice
of
something
beautiful
whispered
a
dim
foreboding
and
yet
so
soft
so
sweet
so
low
it
had
not
more
of
joy
than
woe
and
as
the
sea
doth
oft
lie
still
making
its
waters
meet
as
if
by
an
unconscious
will
for
the
moon
silver
feet
so
lay
my
soul
within
mine
eyes
when
thou
its
guardian
moon
didst
rise
and
now
its
waves
above
may
toss
and
seem
uneaseful
one
strong
eternal
law
of
love
with
guidance
sure
and
peaceful
as
calm
and
natural
as
breath
moves
its
great
deeps
through
life
and
death
remembered
music
a
fragment
like
an
ocean
vast
of
bisons
the
far
prairie
shaking
the
notes
crowd
heavily
and
fast
as
surfs
one
plunging
while
the
last
draws
seaward
from
its
foamy
breaking
or
in
low
murmurs
they
began
rising
and
rising
momently
as
a
harp
æolian
a
fitful
breeze
until
they
ran
up
to
a
sudden
ecstasy
and
then
like
minute
drops
of
rain
ringing
in
water
silvery
they
lingering
dropped
and
dropped
again
till
it
was
almost
like
a
pain
to
listen
when
the
next
would
be
song
to
a
lily
thou
wast
when
i
saw
thee
first
a
not
opened
quite
that
hourly
grew
more
pure
and
white
by
morning
and
noontide
and
evening
nursed
in
all
of
nature
thou
hadst
thy
share
thou
wast
waited
on
by
the
wind
and
sun
the
rain
and
the
dew
for
thee
took
care
it
seemed
thou
never
couldst
be
more
fair
a
lily
thou
wast
when
i
saw
thee
first
a
but
o
how
strange
how
full
of
wonder
was
the
change
when
ripe
with
all
sweetness
thy
full
bloom
burst
how
did
the
tears
to
my
glad
eyes
start
when
the
reached
its
blossoming
hour
and
i
saw
the
warm
deeps
of
thy
golden
heart
glad
death
may
pluck
thee
but
never
before
the
gold
dust
of
thy
bloom
divine
hath
dropped
from
thy
heart
into
mine
to
quicken
its
faint
germs
of
heavenly
lore
for
no
breeze
comes
nigh
thee
but
carries
away
some
impulses
bright
of
fragrance
and
light
which
fall
upon
souls
that
are
lone
and
astray
to
plant
fruitful
hopes
of
the
flower
of
day
allegra
i
would
more
natures
were
like
thine
that
never
casts
a
glance
before
thou
hebe
who
thy
heart
bright
wine
so
lavishly
to
all
dost
pour
that
we
who
drink
forget
to
pine
and
can
but
dream
of
bliss
in
store
thou
canst
not
see
a
shade
in
life
with
sunward
instinct
thou
dost
rise
and
leaving
clouds
below
at
strife
gazest
undazzled
at
the
skies
with
all
their
blazing
splendors
rife
a
songful
lark
with
eagle
eyes
thou
wast
some
foundling
whom
the
hours
nursed
laughing
with
the
milk
of
mirth
some
influence
more
gay
than
ours
hath
ruled
thy
nature
from
its
birth
as
if
thy
natal
stars
were
flowers
that
shook
their
seeds
round
thee
on
earth
and
thou
to
lull
thine
infant
rest
wast
cradled
like
an
indian
child
all
pleasant
winds
from
south
and
west
with
lullabies
thine
ears
beguiled
rocking
thee
in
thine
oriole
nest
till
nature
looked
at
thee
and
smiled
thine
every
fancy
seems
to
borrow
a
sunlight
from
thy
childish
years
making
a
golden
cloud
of
sorrow
a
rainbow
out
of
tears
thy
heart
is
certain
of
though
it
never
peers
i
would
more
natures
were
like
thine
so
innocently
wild
and
free
whose
sad
thoughts
even
leap
and
shine
like
sunny
wavelets
in
the
sea
making
us
mindless
of
the
brine
in
gazing
on
the
brilliancy
the
fountain
into
the
sunshine
full
of
the
light
leaping
and
flashing
from
morn
till
night
into
the
moonlight
whiter
than
snow
waving
so
when
the
winds
blow
into
the
starlight
rushing
in
spray
happy
at
midnight
happy
by
day
ever
in
motion
blithesome
and
cheery
still
climbing
heavenward
never
aweary
glad
of
all
weathers
still
seeming
best
upward
or
downward
motion
thy
rest
full
of
a
nature
nothing
can
tame
changed
every
moment
ever
the
same
ceaseless
aspiring
ceaseless
content
darkness
or
sunshine
thy
element
glorious
fountain
let
my
heart
be
fresh
changeful
constant
upward
like
thee
ode
i
in
the
old
days
of
awe
and
wonder
the
poet
song
with
truth
was
rife
he
saw
the
mysteries
which
circle
under
the
outward
shell
and
skin
of
daily
life
nothing
to
him
were
fleeting
time
and
fashion
his
soul
was
led
by
the
eternal
law
there
was
in
him
no
hope
of
fame
no
passion
but
with
calm
eyes
he
only
saw
he
did
not
sigh
heroes
dead
and
buried
at
the
golden
age
hearse
nor
deem
that
souls
whom
charon
grim
had
ferried
alone
were
fitting
themes
of
epic
verse
he
could
believe
the
promise
of
and
feel
the
wondrous
meaning
of
he
had
a
deeper
faith
in
holy
sorrow
than
the
world
seeming
loss
could
take
away
to
know
the
heart
of
all
things
was
his
duty
all
things
did
sing
to
him
to
make
him
wise
and
with
a
sorrowful
and
conquering
beauty
the
soul
of
all
looked
grandly
from
his
eyes
he
gazed
on
all
within
him
and
without
him
he
watched
the
flowing
of
time
steady
tide
and
shapes
of
glory
floated
all
about
him
and
whispered
to
him
and
he
prophesied
than
all
men
he
more
fearless
was
and
freer
and
all
his
brethren
cried
with
one
accord
behold
the
holy
man
behold
the
seer
him
who
hath
spoken
with
the
unseen
lord
he
to
his
heart
with
large
embrace
had
taken
the
universal
sorrow
of
mankind
and
from
that
root
a
shelter
never
shaken
the
tree
of
wisdom
grew
with
sturdy
rind
he
could
interpret
well
the
wondrous
voices
which
to
the
calm
and
silent
spirit
come
he
knew
that
the
one
soul
no
more
rejoices
in
the
star
anthem
than
the
insect
hum
he
in
his
heart
was
ever
meek
and
humble
and
yet
with
kingly
pomp
his
numbers
ran
as
he
foresaw
how
all
things
false
should
crumble
before
the
free
uplifted
soul
of
man
and
when
he
was
made
full
to
overflowing
with
all
the
loveliness
of
heaven
and
earth
out
rushed
his
song
like
molten
iron
glowing
to
show
god
sitting
by
the
humblest
hearth
with
calmest
courage
he
was
ever
ready
to
teach
that
action
was
the
truth
of
thought
and
with
strong
arm
and
purpose
firm
and
steady
an
anchor
for
the
drifting
world
he
wrought
so
did
he
make
the
meanest
man
partaker
of
all
his
unto
him
gave
all
souls
did
reverence
him
and
name
him
maker
and
when
he
died
heaped
temples
on
his
grave
and
still
his
deathless
words
of
light
are
swimming
serene
throughout
the
great
deep
infinite
of
human
soul
unwaning
and
undimming
to
cheer
and
guide
the
mariner
at
night
ii
but
now
the
poet
is
an
empty
rhymer
who
lies
with
idle
elbow
on
the
grass
and
fits
his
singing
like
a
cunning
timer
to
all
men
prides
and
fancies
as
they
pass
not
his
the
song
which
in
its
metre
holy
chimes
with
the
music
of
the
eternal
stars
humbling
the
tyrant
lifting
up
the
lowly
and
sending
sun
through
the
soul
maker
no
more
o
no
unmaker
rather
for
he
unmakes
who
doth
not
all
put
forth
the
power
given
by
our
loving
father
to
show
the
body
dross
the
spirit
worth
awake
great
spirit
of
the
ages
olden
shiver
the
mists
that
hide
thy
starry
lyre
and
let
man
soul
be
yet
again
beholden
to
thee
for
wings
to
soar
to
her
desire
o
prophesy
no
more
splendor
be
no
more
to
speak
out
for
truth
lay
on
her
altar
all
the
gushings
tender
the
hope
the
fire
the
loving
faith
of
youth
o
prophesy
no
more
the
maker
coming
say
not
his
onward
footsteps
thou
canst
hear
in
the
dim
void
like
to
the
awful
humming
of
the
great
wings
of
some
sphere
o
prophesy
no
more
but
be
the
poet
this
longing
was
but
granted
unto
thee
that
when
all
beauty
thou
couldst
feel
and
know
it
that
beauty
in
its
highest
thou
couldst
be
o
thou
who
moanest
tost
with
longings
who
dimly
hearest
voices
call
on
thee
whose
soul
is
overfilled
with
mighty
throngings
of
love
and
fear
and
glorious
agony
thou
of
the
hands
and
iron
sinews
and
soul
by
with
freedom
fed
in
whom
the
yet
continues
the
old
free
nature
is
not
chained
or
dead
arouse
let
thy
soul
break
in
let
loose
the
ocean
that
is
in
thee
pent
pour
forth
thy
hope
thy
fear
thy
love
thy
wonder
and
tell
the
age
what
all
its
signs
have
meant
thy
wildered
crowd
of
brethren
jostles
there
lingers
but
a
shade
of
wrong
there
still
is
need
of
martyrs
and
apostles
there
still
are
texts
for
song
from
age
to
age
man
still
aspiring
spirit
finds
wider
scope
and
sees
with
clearer
eyes
and
thou
in
larger
measure
dost
inherit
what
made
thy
great
forerunners
free
and
wise
sit
thou
enthroned
where
the
poet
mountain
above
the
thunder
lifts
its
silent
peak
and
roll
thy
songs
down
like
a
gathering
fountain
that
all
may
drink
and
find
the
rest
they
seek
sing
there
shall
silence
grow
in
earth
and
heaven
a
silence
of
deep
awe
and
wondering
for
listening
gladly
bend
the
angels
even
to
hear
a
mortal
like
an
angel
sing
iii
among
the
poor
my
soul
is
seeking
for
one
to
bring
the
maker
name
to
light
to
be
the
voice
of
that
almighty
speaking
which
every
age
demands
to
do
it
right
proprieties
our
silken
bards
environ
he
who
would
be
the
tongue
of
this
wide
land
must
string
his
harp
with
chords
of
sturdy
iron
and
strike
it
with
a
hand
one
who
hath
dwelt
with
nature
who
hath
learnt
wisdom
from
her
mystic
books
whose
soul
with
all
her
countless
lives
hath
blended
so
that
all
beauty
awes
us
in
his
looks
who
not
with
body
waste
his
soul
hath
pampered
who
as
the
clear
northwestern
wind
is
free
who
walks
with
form
observances
unhampered
and
follows
the
one
will
obediently
whose
eyes
like
windows
on
a
breezy
summit
control
a
lovely
prospect
every
way
who
doth
not
sound
god
sea
with
earthly
plummet
and
find
a
bottom
still
of
worthless
clay
who
heeds
not
how
the
lower
gusts
are
working
knowing
that
one
sure
wind
blows
on
above
and
sees
beneath
the
foulest
faces
lurking
one
shrine
of
reverence
and
love
who
sees
all
stars
that
wheel
their
shining
marches
around
the
centre
fixed
of
destiny
where
the
encircling
soul
serene
the
moving
globe
of
being
like
a
sky
who
feels
that
god
and
heaven
great
deeps
are
nearer
him
to
whose
heart
his
is
nigh
who
doth
not
hold
his
soul
own
freedom
dearer
than
that
of
all
his
brethren
low
or
high
who
to
the
right
can
feel
himself
the
truer
for
being
gently
patient
with
the
wrong
who
sees
a
brother
in
the
and
finds
in
love
the
of
his
song
this
this
is
he
for
whom
the
world
is
waiting
to
sing
the
beatings
of
its
mighty
heart
too
long
hath
it
been
patient
with
the
grating
of
and
heard
it
misnamed
art
to
him
the
smiling
soul
of
man
shall
listen
laying
awhile
its
crown
of
thorns
aside
and
once
again
in
every
eye
shall
glisten
the
glory
of
a
nature
satisfied
his
verse
shall
have
a
great
commanding
motion
heaving
and
swelling
with
a
melody
learnt
of
the
sky
the
river
and
the
ocean
and
all
the
pure
majestic
things
that
be
awake
then
thou
we
pine
for
thy
great
presence
to
make
us
feel
the
soul
once
more
sublime
we
are
of
far
too
infinite
an
essence
to
rest
contented
with
the
lies
of
time
speak
out
and
lo
a
hush
of
deepest
wonder
shall
sink
all
this
scene
as
when
a
sudden
burst
of
rattling
thunder
shatters
the
blueness
of

the
fatherland

as

on
the
glass
one
poor
outcast
girl
faces
the
searching
flaws
and
as
about
her
heart
they
whirl
her
tattered
cloak
more
tightly
draws
the
flat
brick
walls
look
cold
and
bleak
her
bare
feet
to
the
sidewalk
freeze
yet
dares
she
not
a
shelter
seek
though
faint
with
hunger
and
disease
the
sharp
storm
cuts
her
forehead
bare
and
piercing
through
her
garments
thin
beats
on
her
shrunken
breast
and
there
makes
colder
the
cold
heart
within
she
lingers
where
a
ruddy
glow
streams
outward
through
an
open
shutter
adding
more
bitterness
to
woe
more
loneness
to
desertion
utter
one
half
the
cold
she
had
not
felt
until
she
saw
this
gush
of
light
spread
warmly
forth
and
seem
to
melt
its
slow
way
through
the
deadening
night
she
hears
a
woman
voice
within
singing
sweet
words
her
childhood
knew
and
years
of
misery
and
sin
furl
off
and
leave
her
heaven
blue
her
freezing
heart
like
one
who
sinks
outwearied
in
the
drifting
snow
drowses
to
deadly
sleep
and
thinks
no
longer
of
its
hopeless
woe
old
fields
and
clear
blue
summer
days
old
meadows
green
with
grass
and
trees
that
shimmer
through
the
trembling
haze
and
whiten
in
the
western
breeze
old
faces
all
the
friendly
past
rises
within
her
heart
again
and
sunshine
from
her
childhood
cast
makes
summer
of
the
icy
rain
enhaloed
by
a
mild
warm
glow
from
all
humanity
apart
she
hears
old
footsteps
wandering
slow
through
the
lone
chambers
of
her
heart
outside
the
porch
before
the
door
her
cheek
upon
the
cold
hard
stone
she
lies
no
longer
foul
and
poor
no
longer
dreary
and
alone
next
morning
something
heavily
against
the
opening
door
did
weigh
and
there
from
sin
and
sorrow
free
a
woman
on
the
threshold
lay
a
smile
upon
the
wan
lips
told
that
she
had
found
a
calm
release
and
that
from
out
the
want
and
cold
the
song
had
borne
her
soul
in
peace
for
whom
the
heart
of
man
shuts
out
sometimes
the
heart
of
god
takes
in
and
fences
them
all
round
about
with
silence
mid
the
world
loud
din
and
one
of
his
great
charities
is
music
and
it
doth
not
scorn
to
close
the
lids
upon
the
eyes
of
the
polluted
and
forlorn
far
was
she
from
her
childhood
home
farther
in
guilt
had
wandered
thence
yet
thither
it
had
bid
her
come
to
die
in
maiden
innocence
midnight
the
moon
shines
white
and
silent
on
the
mist
which
like
a
tide
of
some
enchanted
ocean
the
wide
marsh
doth
glide
spreading
its
billows
silently
far
and
wide
a
vague
and
starry
magic
makes
all
things
mysteries
and
lures
the
earth
dumb
spirit
up
to
the
longing
skies
i
seem
to
hear
dim
whispers
and
tremulous
replies
the
fireflies
the
meadow
in
pulses
come
and
go
the
heavy
shadow
weighs
on
the
grass
below
and
faintly
from
the
distance
the
dreaming
cock
doth
crow
all
things
look
strange
and
mystic
the
very
bushes
swell
and
take
wild
shapes
and
motions
as
if
beneath
a
spell
they
seem
not
the
same
lilacs
from
childhood
known
so
well
the
snow
of
deepest
silence
everything
doth
fall
so
beautiful
and
quiet
and
yet
so
like
a
pall
as
if
all
life
were
ended
and
rest
were
come
to
all
o
wild
and
wondrous
midnight
there
is
a
might
in
thee
to
make
the
charmèd
body
almost
like
spirit
be
and
give
it
some
faint
glimpses
of
immortality
a
prayer
god
do
not
let
my
loved
one
die
but
rather
wait
until
the
time
that
i
am
grown
in
purity
enough
to
enter
thy
pure
clime
then
take
me
i
will
gladly
go
so
that
my
love
remain
below
o
let
her
stay
she
is
by
birth
what
i
through
death
must
learn
to
be
we
need
her
more
on
our
poor
earth
than
thou
canst
need
in
heaven
with
thee
she
hath
her
wings
already
i
must
burst
this
ere
i
fly
then
god
take
me
we
shall
be
near
more
near
than
ever
each
to
each
her
angel
ears
will
find
more
clear
my
heavenly
than
my
earthly
speech
and
still
as
i
draw
nigh
to
thee
her
soul
and
mine
shall
closer
be
the
heritage
the
rich
man
son
inherits
lands
and
piles
of
brick
and
stone
and
gold
and
he
inherits
soft
white
hands
and
tender
flesh
that
fears
the
cold
nor
dares
to
wear
a
garment
old
a
heritage
it
seems
to
me
one
scarce

wish
to

the

inherits
cares
the
bank
may
break
the
factory
burn
a
breath
may
burst
his
bubble
shares
and
soft
white
hands
could
hardly
earn
a
living
that
would
serve
his

a
heritage
it
seems
to
me
one
scarce

the
rich

wants
his
stomach
craves
for
dainty
fare
with
sated
heart
he
hears
the
pants
of
toiling
hinds
with
brown
arms
bare
and
wearies
in
his
easy
chair
a
heritage
it
seems
to
me
one
scarce

in

what
doth
the
poor
man

inherit
stout
muscles
and
a
sinewy
heart
a
hardy

a
hardier
spirit
king
of
two

his
part

the
rose
a
ballad
i
in
his
tower
sat
the
poet
gazing
on
the
roaring
sea
take
this
rose
he
sighed
and
throw
it
where
there
none
that
loveth
me
on
the
rock
the
billow
bursteth
and
sinks
back
into
the
seas
but
in
vain
my
spirit
thirsteth
so
to
burst
and
be
at
ease
take
o
sea
the
tender
blossom
that
hath
lain
against
my
breast
on
thy
black
and
angry
bosom
it
will
find
a
surer
rest
life
is
vain
and
love
is
hollow
ugly
death
stands
there
behind
hate
and
scorn
and
hunger
follow
him
that
toileth
for
his
kind
forth
into
the
night
he
hurled
it
and
with
bitter
smile
did
mark
how
the
surly
tempest
whirled
it
swift
into
the
hungry
dark
foam
and
spray
drive
back
to
leeward
and
the
gale
with
dreary
moan
drifts
the
helpless
blossom
seaward
through
the
breakers
all
alone
ii
stands
a
maiden
on
the
morrow
musing
by
the
strand
half
in
hope
and
half
in
sorrow
tracing
words
upon
the
sand
shall
i
ever
then
behold
him
who
hath
been
my
life
so
long
ever
to
this
sick
heart
fold
him
be
the
spirit
of
his
song
touch
not
sea
the
blessed
letters
i
have
traced
upon
thy
shore
spare
his
name
whose
spirit
fetters
mine
with
love
forevermore
swells
the
tide
and
overflows
it
but
with
omen
pure
and
meet
brings
a
little
rose
and
throws
it
humbly
at
the
maiden
feet
full
of
bliss
she
takes
the
token
and
upon
her
snowy
breast
soothes
the
ruffled
petals
broken
with
the
ocean
fierce
unrest
love
is
thine
o
heart
and
surely
peace
shall
also
be
thine
own
for
the
heart
that
trusteth
purely
never
long
can
pine
alone
iii
in
his
tower
sits
the
poet
blisses
new
and
strange
to
him
fill
his
heart
and
overflow
it
with
a
wonder
sweet
and
dim
up
the
beach
the
ocean
slideth
with
a
whisper
of
delight
and
the
noon
in
silence
glideth
through
the
peaceful
blue
of
night
rippling
the
poet
shoulder
flows
a
maiden
golden
hair
with
love
grown
bolder
kiss
his
forehead
bare
life
is
joy
and
love
is
power
death
all
fetters
doth
unbind
strength
and
wisdom
only
flower
when
we
toil
for
all
our
kind
hope
is
truth
the
future
giveth
more
than
present
takes
away
and
the
soul
forever
liveth
nearer
god
from
day
to
day
not
a
word
the
maiden
uttered
fullest
hearts
are
slow
to
speak
but
a
withered
fluttered
down
upon
the
poet
cheek
a
legend
of
brittany
part
first
i
fair
as
a
summer
dream
was
margaret
such
dream
as
in
a
poet
soul
might
start
musing
of
old
loves
while
the
moon
doth
set
her
hair
was
not
more
sunny
than
her
heart
though
like
a
natural
golden
coronet
it
circled
her
dear
head
with
careless
art
mocking
the
sunshine
that
would
fain
have
lent
to
its
frank
grace
a
richer
ornament
ii
his
loved
one
eyes
could
poet
ever
speak
so
kind
so
dewy
and
so
deep
were
hers
but
while
he
strives
the
choicest
phrase
too
weak
their
glad
reflection
in
his
spirit
blurs
as
one
may
see
a
dream
dissolve
and
break
out
of
his
grasp
when
he
to
tell
it
stirs
like
that
sad
dryad
doomed
no
more
to
bless
the
mortal
who
revealed
her
loveliness
iii
she
dwelt
forever
in
a
region
bright
peopled
with
living
fancies
of
her
own
where
naught
could
come
but
visions
of
delight
far
far
aloof
from
earth
eternal
moan
a
summer
cloud
thrilled
through
with
rosy
light
floating
beneath
the
blue
sky
all
alone
her
spirit
wandered
by
itself
and
won
a
golden
edge
from
some
unsetting
sun
iv
the
heart
grows
richer
that
its
lot
is
poor
god
blesses
want
with
larger
sympathies
love
enters
gladliest
at
the
humble
door
and
makes
the
cot
a
palace
with
his
eyes
so
margaret
heart
a
softer
beauty
wore
and
grew
in
gentleness
and
patience
wise
for
she
was
but
a
simple
herdsman
child
a
lily
in
the
rugged
wild
there
was
no
beauty
of
the
wood
or
field
but
she
its
fragrant
knew
nor
any
but
to
her
would
freely
yield
some
grace
that
in
her
soul
took
root
and
grew
nature
to
her
glowed
ever
all
rosy
fresh
with
innocent
morning
dew
and
looked
into
her
heart
with
dim
sweet
eyes
that
left
it
full
of
sylvan
memories
vi
o
what
a
face
was
hers
to
brighten
light
and
give
back
sunshine
with
an
added
glow
to
wile
each
moment
with
a
fresh
delight
and
part
of
memory
best
contentment
grow
o
how
her
voice
as
with
an
inmate
right
into
the
strangest
heart
would
welcome
go
and
make
it
sweet
and
ready
to
become
of
white
and
gracious
thoughts
the
chosen
home
vii
none
looked
upon
her
but
he
straightway
thought
of
all
the
greenest
depths
of
country
cheer
and
into
each
one
heart
was
freshly
brought
what
was
to
him
the
sweetest
time
of
year
so
was
her
every
look
and
motion
fraught
with
delights
and
forest
lere
not
the
first
violet
on
a
woodland
lea
seemed
a
more
visible
gift
of
spring
than
she
viii
is
love
learned
only
out
of
poets
books
is
there
not
somewhat
in
the
dropping
flood
and
in
the
nunneries
of
silent
nooks
and
in
the
murmured
longing
of
the
wood
that
could
make
margaret
dream
of
lovelorn
looks
and
stir
a
thrilling
mystery
in
her
blood
more
trembly
secret
than
aurora
tear
shed
in
the
bosom
of
an
eglatere
ix
full
many
a
sweet
forewarning
hath
the
mind
full
many
a
whispering
of
vague
desire
ere
comes
the
nature
destined
to
unbind
its
virgin
zone
and
all
its
deeps
inspire
low
stirrings
in
the
leaves
before
the
wind
wakes
all
the
green
strings
of
the
forest
lyre
faint
heatings
in
the
calyx
ere
the
rose
its
warm
voluptuous
breast
doth
all
unclose
x
long
in
its
dim
recesses
pines
the
spirit
wildered
and
dark
despairingly
alone
though
many
a
shape
of
beauty
wander
near
it
and
many
a
wild
and
tone
tremble
from
the
divine
abyss
to
cheer
it
yet
still
it
knows
that
there
is
only
one
before
whom
it
can
kneel
and
tribute
bring
at
once
a
happy
vassal
and
a
king
xi
to
feel
a
want
yet
scarce
know
what
it
is
to
seek
one
nature
that
is
always
new
whose
glance
is
warmer
than
another
kiss
whom
we
can
bare
our
inmost
beauty
to
nor
feel
deserted
afterwards
for
this
but
with
our
destined
we
can
do
such
longing
instinct
fills
the
mighty
scope
of
the
young
soul
with
one
mysterious
hope
xii
so
margaret
heart
grew
brimming
with
the
lore
of
love
enticing
secrets
and
although
she
had
found
none
to
cast
it
down
before
yet
oft
to
fancy
chapel
she
would
go
to
pay
her
vows
and
count
the
rosary
of
her
love
promised
graces
haply
so
miranda
hope
had
pictured
ferdinand
long
ere
the
gaunt
wave
tossed
him
on
the
strand
xiii
a
star
that
swims
the
lonely
gloom
unwedded
yet
and
longing
for
the
sun
whose
beams
the
of
the
lavish
groom
blithely
to
crown
the
virgin
planet
run
her
being
was
watching
to
see
the
bloom
of
love
fresh
sunrise
roofing
one
by
one
its
clouds
with
gold
a
to
be
for
him
who
came
to
hold
her
heart
in
fee
xiv
not
far
from
margaret
cottage
dwelt
a
knight
of
the
proud
templars
a
sworn
celibate
whose
heart
in
secret
fed
upon
the
light
and
dew
of
her
ripe
beauty
through
the
grate
of
his
close
vow
catching
what
gleams
he
might
of
the
free
heaven
and
cursing
all
too
late
the
cruel
faith
whose
black
walls
hemmed
him
in
and
turned
life
crowning
bliss
to
deadly
sin
xv
for
he
had
met
her
in
the
wood
by
chance
and
having
drunk
her
beauty
wildering
spell
his
heart
shook
like
the
pennon
of
a
lance
that
quivers
in
a
breeze
sudden
swell
and
thenceforth
in
a
trance
from
mistily
golden
deep
to
deep
he
fell
till
earth
did
waver
and
fade
far
away
beneath
the
hope
in
whose
warm
arms
he
lay
xvi
a
dark
proud
man
he
was
whose
youth
had
shed
its
blossoms
even
in
opening
leaving
a
few
that
with
more
winning
ruth
trembling
around
grave
manhood
stem
might
cling
more
sad
than
cheery
making
in
good
sooth
like
the
fringed
gentian
a
late
autumn
spring
a
twilight
nature
braided
light
and
gloom
a
youth
by
an
open
tomb
xvii
fair
as
an
angel
who
yet
inly
wore
a
wrinkled
heart
foreboding
his
near
fall
who
saw
him
always
wished
to
know
him
more
as
if
he
were
some
fate
defiant
thrall
and
nursed
a
dreaded
secret
at
its
core
little
he
loved
but
power
most
of
all
and
that
he
seemed
to
scorn
as
one
who
knew
by
what
foul
paths
men
choose
to
crawl
thereto
xviii
he
had
been
noble
but
some
great
deceit
had
turned
his
better
instinct
to
a
vice
he
strove
to
think
the
world
was
all
a
cheat
that
power
and
fame
were
cheap
at
any
price
that
the
sure
way
of
being
shortly
great
was
even
to
play
life
game
with
loaded
dice
since
he
had
tried
the
honest
play
and
found
that
vice
and
virtue

in
sound
xix
yet
margaret
sight
redeemed
him
for
a
space
from
his
own
thraldom
man
could
never
be
a
hypocrite
when
first
such
maiden
grace
smiled
in
upon
his
heart
the
agony
of
wearing
all
day
long
a
lying
face
fell
lightly
from
him
and
a
moment
free
erect
with
wakened
faith
his
spirit
stood
and
scorned
the
weakness
of
its
xx
like
a
sweet
to
him
was
her
thought
which
would
not
let
the
common
air
come
near
till
from
its
dim
enchantment
it
had
caught
a
musical
tenderness
that
brimmed
his
ear
with
sweetness
more
ethereal
than
aught
save
snatches
that
whilere
rained
down
from
some
sad
angel
faithful
harp
to
cool
her
fallen
lover
anguish
sharp
xxi
deep
in
the
forest
was
a
little
dell
high
overarchèd
with
the
leafy
sweep
of
a
broad
oak
through
whose
gnarled
roots
there
fell
a
slender
rill
that
sung
itself
asleep
where
its
continuous
toil
had
scooped
a
well
to
please
the
fairy
folk
breathlessly
deep
the
stillness
was
save
when
the
dreaming
brook
from
its
small
urn
a
drizzly
murmur
shook
xxii
the
wooded
hills
sloped
upward
all
around
with
gradual
rise
and
made
an
even
rim
so
that
it
seemed
a
mighty
casque
unbound
from
some
huge
titan
brow
to
lighten
him
ages
ago
and
left
upon
the
ground
where
the
slow
soil
had
mossed
it
to
the
brim
till
after
countless
centuries
it
grew
into
this
dell
the
haunt
of
noontide
dew
xxiii
dim
vistas
sprinkled
with
green
wound
through
the
thickset
trunks
on
every
side
and
toward
the
west
in
fancy
might
be
seen
a
gothic
window
in
its
blazing
pride
when
the
low
sun
two
arching
elms
between
lit
up
the
leaves
beyond
which
with
lavish
hues
would
into
splendor
start
shaming
the
labored
panes
of
richest
art
xxiv
here
leaning
once
against
the
old
oak
trunk
mordred
for
such
was
the
young
templar
name
saw
margaret
come
unseen
the
falcon
shrunk
from
the
meek
dove
sharp
thrills
of
tingling
flame
made
him
forget
that
he
was
vowed
a
monk
and
all
the
outworks
of
his
pride
flooded
he
seemed
with
bright
delicious
pain
as
if
a
star
had
burst
within
his
brain
xxv
such
power
hath
beauty
and
frank
innocence
a
flower
bloomed
forth
that
sunshine
glad
to
bless
even
from
his
love
long
leafless
stem
the
sense
of
exile
from
hope
happy
realm
grew
less
and
thoughts
of
childish
peace
he
knew
not
whence
thronged
round
his
heart
with
many
an
old
caress
melting
the
frost
there
into
pearly
dew
that
mirrored
back
his
nature
xxvi
she
turned
and
saw
him
but
she
felt
no
dread
her
purity
like
adamantine
mail
did
so
encircle
her
and
yet
her
head
she
drooped
and
made
her
golden
hair
her
veil
through
which
a
glow
of
rosiest
lustre
spread
then
faded
and
anon
she
stood
all
pale
as
snow
which
a
blush
of
suddenly
reddens
and
as
soon
grows
white
xxvii
she
thought
of
tristrem
and
of
lancilot
of
all
her
dreams
and
of
kind
fairies
might
and
how
that
dell
was
deemed
a
haunted
spot
until
there
grew
a
mist
before
her
sight
and
where
the
present
was
she
half
forgot
borne
backward
through
the
realms
of
old
delight
then
starting
up
awake
she
would
have
gone
yet
almost
wished
it
might
not
be
alone
xxviii
how
they
went
home
together
through
the
wood
and
how
all
life
seemed
focussed
into
one
spot
that
set
ablaze
the
blood
what
need
to
tell
fit
language
there
is
none
for
the
heart
deepest
things
who
ever
wooed
as
in
his
boyish
hope
he
would
have
done
for
when
the
soul
is
fullest
the
hushed
tongue
voicelessly
trembles
like
a
lute
unstrung
xxix
but
all
things
carry
the
heart
messages
and
know
it
not
nor
doth
the
heart
well
know
but
nature
hath
her
will
even
as
the
bees
blithe
fly
singing
to
and
fro
with
the
pollen
hard
if
these
found
not
some
all
way
to
show
their
secret
each
to
each
and
so
they
did
and
one
heart
into
the
other
slid
xxx
young
hearts
are
free
the
selfish
world
it
is
that
turns
them
miserly
and
cold
as
stone
and
makes
them
clutch
their
fingers
on
the
bliss
which
but
in
giving
truly
is
their
own
she
had
no
dreams
of
barter
asked
not
his
but
gave
hers
freely
as
she
would
have
thrown
a
rose
to
him
or
as
that
rose
gives
forth
its
generous
fragrance
thoughtless
of
its
worth
xxxi
her
summer
nature
felt
a
need
to
bless
and
a
like
longing
to
be
blest
again
so
from
her
spirit
gentleness
dropt
ever
like
a
sunlit
fall
of
rain
and
his
beneath
drank
in
the
bright
caress
as
thirstily
as
would
a
parchèd
plain
that
long
hath
watched
the
showers
of
sloping
gray
forever
ever
falling
far
away
xxxii
how
should
she
dream
of
ill
the
heart
filled
quite
with
sunshine
like
the
at
noon
closes
its
leaves
around
its
warm
delight
in
life
is
harsh
or
out
of
tune
is
all
shut
out
no
boding
shade
of
light
can
pierce
the
opiate
ether
of
its
swoon
love
is
but
blind
as
thoughtful
justice
is
but
naught
can
be
so
as
bliss
xxxiii
all
beauty
and
all
life
he
was
to
her
she
questioned
not
his
love
she
only
knew
that
she
loved
him
and
not
a
pulse
could
stir
in
her
whole
frame
but
quivered
through
and
through
with
this
glad
thought
and
was
a
minister
to
do
him
fealty
and
service
true
like
golden
ripples
hasting
to
the
land
to
wreck
their
freight
of
sunshine
on
the
strand
xxxiv
o
dewy
dawn
of
love
o
hopes
that
are
hung
high
like
the
perilous
nest
most
like
to
fall
when
fullest
and
that
jar
with
every
heavier
billow
o
unrest
than
balmiest
deeps
of
quiet
sweeter
far
how
did
ye
triumph
now
in
margaret
breast
making
it
readier
to
shrink
and
start
than
quivering
gold
of
the
heart
xxxv
here
let
us
pause
o
would
the
soul
might
ever
achieve
its
immortality
in
youth
when
nothing
yet
hath
damped
its
high
endeavor
after
the
starry
energy
of
truth
here
let
us
pause
and
for
a
moment
sever
this
gleam
of
sunshine
from
the
days
unruth
that
sometime
come
to
all
for
it
is
good
to
lengthen
to
the
last
a
sunny
mood
part
second
i
as
one
who
from
the
sunshine
and
the
green
enters
the
solid
darkness
of
a
cave
nor
knows
what
precipice
or
pit
unseen
may
yawn
before
him
with
its
sudden
grave
and
with
hushed
breath
doth
often
forward
lean
dreaming
he
hears
the
plashing
of
a
wave
dimly
below
or
feels
a
damper
air
from
out
some
dreary
chasm
he
knows
not
where
ii
so
from
the
sunshine
and
the
green
of
love
we
enter
on
our
story
darker
part
and
though
the
horror
of
it
well
may
move
an
impulse
of
repugnance
in
the
heart
yet
let
us
think
that
as
there
naught
above
the
atmosphere
of
art
so
also
there
is
naught
that
falls
below
her
generous
reach
though
grimed
with
guilt
and
woe
iii
her
fittest
triumph
is
to
show
that
good
lurks
in
the
heart
of
evil
evermore
that
love
though
scorned
and
outcast
and
withstood
can
without
end
forgive
and
yet
have
store
god
love
and
man
are
of
the
blood
and
he
can
see
that
always
at
the
door
of
foulest
hearts
the
yet
knocks
to
return
and
cancel
all
its
debt
iv
it
ever
is
weak
falsehood
destiny
that
her
thick
mask
turns
crystal
to
let
through
the
unsuspicious
eyes
of
honesty
but
margaret
heart
was
too
sincere
and
true
aught
but
plain
truth
and
faithfulness
to
see
and
mordred
for
a
time
a
little
grew
to
be
like
hers
won
by
the
mild
reproof
of
those
kind
eyes
that
kept
all
doubt
aloof
full
oft
they
met
as
dawn
and
twilight
meet
in
northern
climes
she
full
of
growing
day
as
he
of
darkness
which
before
her
feet
shrank
gradual
and
faded
quite
away
soon
to
return
for
power
had
made
love
sweet
to
him
and
when
his
will
had
gained
full
sway
the
taste
began
to
pall
for
never
power
can
sate
the
hungry
soul
beyond
an
hour
vi
he
fell
as
doth
the
tempter
ever
fall
even
in
the
gaining
of
his
loathsome
end
god
doth
not
work
as
man
works
but
makes
all
the
crooked
paths
of
ill
to
goodness
tend
let
him
judge
margaret
if
to
be
the
thrall
of
love
and
faith
too
generous
to
defend
its
very
life
from
him
she
loved
be
sin
what
hope
of
grace
may
the
seducer
win
vii
world
that
with
levite
eyes
on
those
poor
fallen
by
too
much
faith
in
man
she
that
upon
thy
freezing
threshold
lies
starved
to
more
sinning
by
thy
savage
ban
seeking
that
refuge
because
foulest
vice
more
than
thy
virtue
is
whose
span
shuts
out
the
wretched
only
is
more
free
to
enter
heaven
than
thou
wilt
ever
be
viii
thou
wilt
not
let
her
wash
thy
dainty
feet
with
such
salt
things
as
tears
or
with
rude
hair
dry
them
soft
pharisee
that
at
meat
with
him
who
made
her
such
and
him
fair
leaving
god
wandering
lamb
the
while
to
bleat
unheeded
shivering
in
the
pitiless
air
thou
hast
made
prisoned
virtue
show
more
wan
and
haggard
than
a
vice
to
look
upon
ix
now
many
months
flew
by
and
weary
grew
to
margaret
the
sight
of
happy
things
blight
fell
on
all
her
flowers
instead
of
dew
shut
round
her
heart
were
now
the
joyous
wings
wherewith
it
wont
to
soar
yet
not
untrue
though
tempted
much
her
woman
nature
clings
to
its
first
pure
belief
and
with
sad
eyes
looks
backward
the
gate
of
paradise
x
and
so
though
altered
mordred
came
less
oft
and
winter
frowned
where
spring
had
laughed
before
in
his
strange
eyes
yet
half
her
sadness
doffed
and
in
her
silent
patience
loved
him
more
sorrow
had
made
her
soft
heart
yet
more
soft
and
a
new
life
within
her
own
she
bore
which
made
her
tenderer
as
she
felt
it
move
beneath
her
breast
a
refuge
for
her
love
xi
this
babe
she
thought
would
surely
bring
him
back
and
be
a
bond
forever
them
between
before
its
eyes
the
sullen
would
fade
and
leave
the
face
of
heaven
serene
and
love
return
doth
more
than
fill
the
lack
which
in
his
absence
withered
the
heart
green
and
yet
a
dim
foreboding
still
would
flit
between
her
and
her
hope
to
darken
it
xii
she
could
not
figure
forth
a
happy
fate
even
for
this
life
from
heaven
so
newly
come
the
earth
must
needs
be
doubly
desolate
to
him
scarce
parted
from
a
fairer
home
such
boding
heavier
on
her
bosom
sate
one
night
as
standing
in
the
twilight
gloam
she
strained
her
eyes
beyond
that
dizzy
verge
at
whose
foot
faintly
breaks
the
future
surge
xiii
poor
little
spirit
naught
but
shame
and
woe
nurse
the
sick
heart
whose
lifeblood
nurses
thine
yet
not
those
only
love
hath
triumphed
so
as
for
thy
sake
makes
sorrow
more
divine
and
yet
though
thou
be
pure
the
world
is
foe
to
purity
if
born
in
such
a
shrine
and
having
trampled
it
for
struggling
thence
smiles
to
itself
and
calls
it
providence
xiv
as
thus
she
mused
a
shadow
seemed
to
rise
from
out
her
thought
and
turn
to
dreariness
all
blissful
hopes
and
sunny
memories
and
the
quick
blood
doth
curdle
up
and
press
about
her
heart
which
seemed
to
shut
its
eyes
and
hush
itself
as
who
with
shuddering
guess
harks
through
the
gloom
and
dreads
now
to
feel
through
his
hot
breast
the
icy
slide
of
steel
xv
but
at
the
while
in
dread
she
was
in
the
low
wind
the
honeysuckles
gleam
a
dewy
thrill
flits
through
the
heavy
grass
and
looking
forth
she
saw
as
in
a
dream
within
the
wood
the
moonlight
shadowy
mass
night
starry
heart
yearning
to
hers
doth
seem
and
the
deep
sky
with
the
moon
folds
round
her
all
the
happiness
of
june
xvi
what
fear
could
face
a
heaven
and
earth
like
this
what
silveriest
cloud
could
hang
such
a
sky
a
tide
of
wondrous
and
unwonted
bliss
rolls
back
through
all
her
pulses
suddenly
as
if
some
seraph
who
had
learned
to
kiss
from
the
fair
daughters
of
the
world
gone
by
had
wedded
so
his
fallen
light
with
hers
such
sweet
strange
joy
through
soul
and
body
stirs
xvii
now
seek
we
mordred
he
who
did
not
fear
the
crime
yet
fears
the
latent
consequence
if
it
should
reach
a
brother
templar
ear
it
haply
might
be
made
a
good
pretence
to
cheat
him
of
the
hope
he
held
most
dear
for
he
had
spared
no
thought
or
deed
expense
that
might
help
his
wish
to
clip
its
darling
bride
the
high
grand
mastership
xviii
the
apathy
ere
a
crime
resolved
is
done
is
scarce
less
dreadful
than
remorse
for
crime
by
no
allurement
can
the
soul
be
won
from
brooding
the
weary
creep
of
time
mordred
stole
forth
into
the
happy
sun
striving
to
hum
a
scrap
of
breton
rhyme
but
the
sky
struck
him
speechless
and
he
tried
in
vain
to
summon
up
his
callous
pride
xix
in
the
a
fountain
leaped
alway
a
triton
blowing
jewels
through
his
shell
into
the
sunshine
mordred
turned
away
weary
because
the
stone
face
did
not
tell
of
weariness
nor
could
he
bear
heartsick
to
hear
the
patient
sink
and
swell
of
winds
among
the
leaves
or
golden
bees
drowsily
humming
in
the
xx
all
happy
sights
and
sounds
now
came
to
him
like
a
reproach
he
wandered
far
and
wide
following
the
lead
of
his
unquiet
whim
but
still
there
went
a
something
at
his
side
that
made
the
cool
breeze
hot
the
sunshine
dim
it
would
not
flee
it
could
not
be
defied
he
could
not
see
it
but
he
felt
it
there
by
the
damp
chill
that
crept
among
his
hair
xxi
day
wore
at
last
the
evening
star
arose
and
throbbing
in
the
sky
grew
red
and
set
then
with
a
guilty
wavering
step
he
goes
to
the
hid
nook
where
they
so
oft
had
met
in
happier
season
for
his
heart
well
knows
that
he
is
sure
to
find
poor
margaret
watching
and
waiting
there
with
lovelorn
breast
around
her
young
dream
rudely
scattered
nest
xxii
why
follow
here
that
grim
old
chronicle
which
counts
the
and
drops
of
blood
enough
that
margaret
by
his
mad
steel
fell
unmoved
by
murder
from
her
trusting
mood
smiling
on
him
as
heaven
smiles
on
hell
with
a
sad
love
remembering
when
he
stood
not
fallen
yet
the
unsealer
of
her
heart
of
all
her
holy
dreams
the
holiest
part
xxiii
his
crime
complete
scarce
knowing
what
he
did
so
goes
the
tale
beneath
the
altar
there
in
the
high
church
the
stiffening
corpse
he
hid
and
then
to
that
suffocating
air
like
a
scared
ghoul
out
of
the
porch
he
slid
but
his
strained
eyes
saw
bloodspots
everywhere
and
ghastly
faces
thrust
themselves
between
his
soul
and
hopes
of
peace
with
blasting
mien
xxiv
his
heart
went
out
within
him
like
a
spark
dropt
in
the
sea
wherever
he
made
bold
to
turn
his
eyes
he
saw
all
stiff
and
stark
pale
margaret
lying
dead
the
lavish
gold
of
her
loose
hair
seemed
in
the
cloudy
dark
to
spread
a
glory
and
a
thousandfold
more
strangely
pale
and
beautiful
she
grew
her
silence
stabbed
his
conscience
through
and
through
xxv
or
visions
of
past
days
a
mother
eyes
that
smiled
down
on
the
fair
boy
at
her
knee
whose
happy
upturned
face
to
hers
replies
he
saw
sometimes
or
margaret
mournfully
gazed
on
him
full
of
doubt
as
one
who
tries
to
crush
belief

injury

wring

out
through
cloudy
pain

meanwhile
he
dared
not
go
and
steal
away
the
silent
witness
of
his
sin
he
had
not
feared
the
life
but
that
dull
clay
those
open
eyes
that
showed
the
death
within
would
surely
stare
him
mad
yet
all
the
day
a
dreadful
impulse
whence
his
will
could
win
no
refuge
made
him
linger
in
the
aisle
freezing
with
his
wan
look
each
greeting
smile
xxvii
now
on
the
second
day
there
was
to
be
a
festival
in
church
from
far
and
near
came
flocking
in
the
sunburnt
peasantry
and
knights
and
dames
with
stately
antique
cheer
blazing
with
pomp
as
if
all
faërie
had
emptied
her
quaint
halls
or
as
it
were
the
illuminated
marge
of
some
old
book
while
we
were
gazing
life
and
motion
took
xxviii
when
all
were
entered
and
the
roving
eyes
of
all
were
staid
some
upon
faces
bright
some
on
the
priests
some
on
the
traceries
that
decked
the
slumber
of
a
marble
knight
and
all
the
rustlings
over
that
arise
from
recognizing
tokens
of
delight
when
friendly
glances
meet
then
silent
ease
spread
the
multitude
by
slow
degrees
xxix
then
swelled
the
organ
up
through
choir
and
nave
the
music
trembled
with
an
inward
thrill
of
bliss
at
its
own
grandeur
wave
on
wave
its
flood
of
mellow
thunder
rose
until
the
hushed
air
shivered
with
the
throb
it
gave
then
poising
for
a
moment
it
stood
still
and
sank
and
rose
again
to
burst
in
spray
that
wandered
into
silence
far
away
xxx
like
to
a
mighty
heart
the
music
seemed
that
yearns
with
melodies
it
can
not
speak
until
in
grand
despair
of
what
it
dreamed
in
the
agony
of
effort
it
doth
break
yet
triumphs
breaking
on
it
rushed
and
streamed
and
wantoned
in
its
might
as
when
a
lake
long
pent
among
the
mountains
bursts
its
walls
and
in
one
crowding
gush
leaps
forth
and
falls
xxxi
deeper
and
deeper
shudders
shook
the
air
as
the
huge
bass
kept
gathering
heavily
like
thunder
when
it
rouses
in
its
lair
and
with
its
hoarse
growl
shakes
the
sky
it
grew
up
like
a
darkness
everywhere
filling
the
vast
cathedral
suddenly
from
the
dense
mass
a
boy
clear
treble
broke
like
lightning
and
the
choir
awoke
xxxii
through
gorgeous
windows
shone
the
sun
aslant
brimming
the
church
with
gold
and
purple
mist
meet
atmosphere
to
bosom
that
rich
chant
where
fifty
voices
in
one
strand
did
twist
their
varicolored
tones
and
left
no
want
to
the
delighted
soul
which
sank
abyssed
in
the
warm
music
cloud
while
far
below
the
organ
heaved
its
surges
to
and
fro
xxxiii
as
if
a
lark
should
suddenly
drop
dead
while
the
blue
air
yet
trembled
with
its
song
so
snapped
at
once
that
music
golden
thread
struck
by
a
nameless
fear
that
leapt
along
from
heart
to
heart
and
like
a
shadow
spread
with
instantaneous
shiver
through
the
throng
so
that
some
glanced
behind
as
half
aware
a
hideous
shape
of
dread
were
standing
there
xxxiv
as
when
a
crowd
of
pale
men
gather
round
watching
an
eddy
in
the
leaden
deep
from
which
they
deem
the
body
of
one
drowned
will
be
cast
forth
from
face
to
face
doth
creep
an
eager
dread
that
holds
all
tongues
fast
bound
until
the
horror
with
a
ghastly
leap
starts
up
its
dead
blue
arms
stretched
aimlessly
heaved
with
the
swinging
of
the
careless
sea
xxxv
so
in
the
faces
of
all
these
there
grew
as
by
one
impulse
a
dark
freezing
awe
which
with
a
fearful
fascination
drew
all
eyes
toward
the
altar
damp
and
raw
the
air
grew
suddenly
and
no
man
knew
whether
perchance
his
silent
neighbor
saw
the
dreadful
thing
which
all
were
sure
would
rise
to
scare
the
strained
lids
wider
from
their
eyes
xxxvi
the
incense
trembled
as
it
upward
sent
its
slow
uncertain
thread
of
wandering
blue
as
were
the
only
living
element
in
all
the
church
so
deep
the
stillness
grew
it
seemed
one
might
have
heard
it
as
it
went
give
out
an
audible
rustle
curling
through
the
midnight
silence
of
that
air
more
hushed
than
death
though
so
much
life
was
there
xxxvii
nothing
they
saw
but
a
low
voice
was
heard
threading
the
ominous
silence
of
that
fear
gentle
and
terrorless
as
if
a
bird
wakened
by
some
volcano
glare
should
cheer
the
murk
air
with
his
song
yet
every
word
in
the
cathedral
farthest
arch
seemed
near
as
if
it
spoke
to
every
one
apart
like
the
clear
voice
of
conscience
in
each
heart
xxxviii
o
rest
to
weary
hearts
thou
art
most
dear
o
silence
after
life
bewildering
din

art
most
welcome
whether
in
the
sear

our
age
thou
comest
or
we
win
thy
in
youth
then
wherefore
here
linger
i
yet
once
free
to
enter
in
at
that
wished
gate
which
gentle
death
doth
ope
into
the
boundless
realm
of
strength
and
hope
xxxix
think
not
in
death
my
love
could
ever
cease
if
thou
wast
false

need
there
is
for
me
still
to
be
true
that
slumber
were
not
peace
if
were
unvisited
with
dreams
of
thee
and
thou
hadst
never
heard
such
words
as
these
save
that
in
heaven
i
must
ever
be
most
comfortless
and
wretched
seeing
this
our
unbaptizèd
babe
shut
out
from
bliss
xl
this
little
spirit
with
imploring
eyes
wanders
alone
the
dreary
wild
of
space
the
shadow
of
his
pain
forever
lies
upon
my
soul
in
this
new
his
loneliness
makes
me
in
paradise
more
lonely
and
unless
i
see
his
face
even
here
for
grief
could
i
lie
down
and
die
save
for
my
curse
of
immortality
xli
world
after
world
he
sees
around
him
swim
crowded
with
happy
souls
that
take
no
heed
of
the
sad
eyes
that
from
the
night
faint
rim
gaze
sick
with
longing
on
them
as
they
speed
with
golden
gates
that
only
shut
out
him
and
shapes
sometimes
from
hell
abysses
freed
flap
darkly
by
him
with
enormous
sweep
of
wings
that
roughen
wide
the
pitchy
deep
xlii
i
am
a
mother
spirits
do
not
shake
this
much
of
earth
from
them
and
i
must
pine
till
i
can
feel
his
little
hands
and
take
his
weary
head
upon
this
heart
of
mine
and
might
it
be
full
gladly
for
his
sake
would
i
this
solitude
of
bliss
resign
and
be
shut
out
of
heaven
to
dwell
with
him
forever
in
that
silence
drear
and
dim
xliii
i
strove
to
hush
my
soul
and
would
not
speak
at
first
for
thy
dear
sake
a
woman
love
is
mighty
but
a
mother
heart
is
weak
and
by
its
weakness
overcomes
i
strove
to
smother
bitter
thoughts
with
patience
meek
but
still
in
the
abyss
my
soul
would
rove
seeking
my
child
and
drove
me
here
to
claim
the
rite
that
gives
him
peace
in
christ
dear
name
xliv
i
sit
and
weep
while
blessed
spirits
sing
i
can
but
long
and
pine
the
while
they
praise
and
leaning
the
wall
of
heaven
i
fling
my
voice
to
where
i
deem
my
infant
strays
like
a
robbed
bird
that
cries
in
vain
to
bring
her
nestlings
back
beneath
her
wings
embrace
but
still
he
answers
not
and
i
but
know
that
heaven
and
earth
are
both
alike
in
woe
xlv
then
the
pale
priests
with
ceremony
due
baptized
the
child
within
its
dreadful
tomb
beneath
that
mother
heart
whose
instinct
true
had
battled
down
the
triple
gloom
of
sorrow
love
and
death
young
maidens
too
strewed
the
pale
corpse
with
many
a
milkwhite
bloom
and
parted
the
bright
hair
and
on
the
breast
crossed
the
unconscious
hands
in
sign
of
rest
xlvi
some
said
that
when
the
priest
had
sprinkled
the
consecrated
drops
they
seemed
to
hear
a
sigh
as
of
some
heart
from
travail
sore
released
and
then
two
voices
singing
clear
more
and
more
fading
far
upward
and
their
ghastly
fear
fell
from
them
with
that
sound
as
bodies
fall
from
souls
upspringing
to
celestial
hall
prometheus
one
after
one
the
stars
have
risen
and
set
sparkling
upon
the
hoarfrost
on
my
chain
the
bear
that
prowled
all
night
about
the
fold
of
the
hath
shrunk
into
his
den
scared
by
the
blithesome
footsteps
of
the
dawn
whose
blushing
smile
floods
all
the
orient
and
now
bright
lucifer
grows
less
and
less
into
the
heaven
blue
quiet
sunless
and
starless
all
the
desert
sky
arches
above
me
empty
as
this
heart
for
ages
hath
been
empty
of
all
joy
except
to
brood
upon
its
silent
hope
as
its
hope
of
day
the
sky
doth
now
all
night
have
i
heard
voices
deeper
yet
the
deep
low
breathing
of
the
silence
grew
while
all
about
muffled
in
awe
there
stood
shadows
or
forms
or
both
at
heart
but
when
i
turned
to
front
them
far
along
only
a
shudder
through
the
midnight
ran
and
the
dense
stillness
walled
me
closer
round
but
still
i
heard
them
wander
up
and
down
that
solitude
and
flappings
of
dusk
wings
did
mingle
with
them
whether
of
those
hags
let
slip
upon
me
once
from
hades
deep
or
of
yet
direr
torments
if
such
be
i
could
but
guess
and
then
toward
me
came
a
shape
as
of
a
woman
very
pale
it
was
and
calm
its
cold
eyes
did
not
move
and
mine
moved
not
but
only
stared
on
them
their
fixed
awe
went
through
my
brain
like
ice
a
skeleton
hand
seemed
clutching
at
my
heart
and
a
sharp
chill
as
if
a
dank
night
fog
suddenly
closed
me
in
was
all
i
felt
and
then
methought
i
heard
a
freezing
sigh
a
long
deep
shivering
sigh
as
from
blue
lips
stiffening
in
death
close
to
mine
ear
i
thought
some
doom
was
close
upon
me
and
i
looked
and
saw
the
red
moon
through
the
heavy
mist
just
setting
and
it
seemed
as
if
it
were
falling
or
reeling
to
its
fall
so
dim
and
dead
and
it
looked
then
all
sounds
merged
into
the
rising
surges
of
the
pines
which
leagues
below
me
clothing
the
gaunt
loins
of
ancient
caucasus
with
hairy
strength
sent
up
a
murmur
in
the
morning
wind
sad
as
the
wail
that
from
the
populous
earth
all
day
and
night
to
high
olympus
soars
fit
incense
to
thy
wicked
throne
o
jove
thy
hated
name
is
tossed
once
more
in
scorn
from
off
my
lips
for
i
will
tell
thy
doom
and
are
these
tears
nay
do
not
triumph
jove
they
are
wrung
from
me
but
by
the
agonies
of
prophecy
like
those
sparse
drops
which
fall
from
clouds
in
travail
of
the
lightning
when
the
great
wave
of
the
storm
and
black
rolls
steadily
onward
to
its
thunderous
break
why
art
thou
made
a
god
of
thou
poor
type
of
anger
and
revenge
and
cunning
force
true
power
was
never
born
of
brutish
strength
nor
sweet
truth
suckled
at
the
shaggy
dugs
of
that
old
are
thy
thunderbolts
that
quell
the
darkness
for
a
space
so
strong
as
the
prevailing
patience
of
meek
light
who
with
the
invincible
tenderness
of
peace
wins
it
to
be
a
portion
of
herself
why
art
thou
made
a
god
of
thou
who
hast
the
terror
at
thy
heart
that
birthright
of
all
tyrants
worse
to
bear
than
this
thy
ravening
bird
on
which
i
smile
thou
to
free
me
if
i
will
unfold
what
kind
of
doom
it
is
whose
omen
flits
across
thy
heart
as
a
troop
of
doves
the
fearful
shadow
of
the
kite
what
need
to
know
that
truth
whose
knowledge
can
not
save
evil

errand
hath
as
well
as
good
when
thine
is
finished
thou
art
known
no
more
there
is
a
higher
purity
than
thou
and
higher
purity
is
greater
strength
thy
nature
is
thy
doom
at
which
thy
heart
trembles
behind
the
thick
wall
of
thy
might
let
man
but
hope
and
thou
art
straightway
chilled
with
thought
of
that
drear
silence
and
deep
night
which
like
a
dream
shall
swallow
thee
and
thine
let
man
but
will
and
thou
art
god
no
more
more
capable
of
ruin
than
the
gold
and
ivory
that
image
thee
on
earth
he
who
hurled
down
the
monstrous
blinded
with
lightnings
with
rough
thunders
stunned
is
weaker
than
a
simple
human
thought
my
slender
voice
can
shake
thee
as
the
breeze
that
seems
but
apt
to
stir
a
maiden
hair
sways
huge
oceanus
from
pole
to
pole

am
still
prometheus
and
foreknow
in
my
wise
heart
the
end
and
doom
of
all
yes
i
am
still
prometheus
wiser
grown
by
years
of
solitude
that
holds
apart
the
past
and
future
giving
the
soul
room
to
search
into
itself
and
long
commune
with
this
eternal
silence
more
a
god
in
my
and
strength
to
meet
with
equal
front
the
direst
shafts
of
fate
than
thou
in
thy
despotism
girt
with
thy
of
force
and
wrath
yes
i
am

prometheus
who
brought
down
the
light
to
man
which
thou
in
selfish
fear
hadst
to
thyself
usurped
his
by
sole
right
for
man
hath
right
to
all
save
tyranny
and
which
shall
free
him
yet
from
thy
frail
throne
tyrants
are
but
the
spawn
of
ignorance
begotten
by
the
slaves
they
trample
on
who
could
they
win
a
glimmer
of
the
light
and
see
that
tyranny
is
always
weakness
or
fear
with
its
own
bosom
ill
at
ease
would
laugh
away
in
scorn
the
chain
which
their
own
blindness
feigned
for
adamant
wrong
ever
builds
on
quicksands
but
the
right
to
the
firm
centre
lays
its
moveless
base
the
tyrant
trembles
if
the
air
but
stirs
the
innocent
ringlets
of
a
child
free
hair
and
crouches
when
the
thought
of
some
great
spirit
with
murmur
like
a
rising
gale
over
men
hearts
as
over
standing
corn
rushes
and
bends
them
to
its
own
strong
will
so
shall
some
thought
of
mine
yet
circle
earth
and
puff
away
thy
crumbling
altars
jove
and
wouldst
thou
know
of
my
supreme
revenge
poor
tyrant
even
now
dethroned
in
heart
realmless
in
soul
as
tyrants
ever
are
listen
and
tell
me
if
this
bitter
peak
this
vulture
and
these
chains
shrink
not
before
it
for
it
shall
befit
a
unconquered
men
when
their
death
is
on
them
seem
to
stand
on
a
precipitous
crag
that
overhangs
the
abyss
of
doom
and
in
that
depth
to
see
as
in
a
glass
the
features
dim
and
vast
of
things
to
come
the
shadows

fronts

not
fearfully

with
clear
promises

broad
vans
upborne
their
widens

wrongs
builds
a
triumphal
arch
through
which
i
see
a
sceptre
and
a
throne
the
pipings
of
glad
shepherds
on
the
hills
tending
the
flocks
no
more
to
bleed
for
thee
the
songs
of
maidens
pressing
with
white
feet
the
vintage
on
thine
altars
poured
no
more
the
murmurous
bliss
of
lovers
underneath
dim
bowers
whose
rosy
bunches
press
not
half
so
closely
their
warm
cheeks
unpaled
by
thoughts
of
thy
brute
lust
the
hum
of
peaceful
commonwealths
where
sunburnt
toil
reaps
for
itself
the
rich
earth
made
its
own
by
its
own
labor
lightened
with
glad
hymns
to
an
omnipotence
which
thy
mad
bolts
would
cope
with

a
spark
with
the
vast
sea

the
spirit
of
free
love
and
peace
duty

these
are
such
harvests
as
all
reap
haply
not
on
earth
but
reap
no
less
because
the
sheaves
are
bound
by
hands
not
theirs
these
are
the
bloodless
daggers
wherewithal
they
stab
fallen
tyrants
this
their
high
revenge
for
their
best
part
of
life
on
earth
is
when
long
after
death
prisoned
and
pent
no
more
their
thoughts
their
wild
dreams
even
have
become
part
of
the
necessary
air
men
breathe
when
like
the
moon
herself
behind
a
cloud
they
shed
down
light
before
us
on
life
sea
that
cheers
us
to
steer
onward
still
in
hope
earth
with
her
twining
memories
ivies
their
holy
sepulchres
the
chainless
sea
in
tempest
or
wide
calm
repeats
their
thoughts
the
lightning
and
the
thunder
all
free
things
have
legends
of
them
for
the
ears
of
men
all
other
glories
are
as
falling
stars
but
universal
nature
watches
theirs
such
strength
is
won
by
love
of
human
kind
not
that
i
feel
that
hunger
after
fame
which
souls
of
a
are
beset
with
but
that
the
memory
of
noble
deeds
cries
shame
upon
the
idle
and
the
vile
and
keeps
the
heart
of
man
forever
up
to
the
heroic
level
of
old
time
to
be
forgot
at
first
is
little
pain
to
a
heart
conscious
of
such
high
intent
as
must
be
deathless
on
the
lips
of
men
but
having
been
a
name
to
sink
and
be
a
something
which
the
world
can
do
without
which
having
been
or
not
would
never
change
the
lightest
pulse
of
fate
this
is
indeed
a
cup
of
bitterness
the
worst
to
taste
and
this
thy
heart
shall
empty
to
the
dregs
endless
despair
shall
be
thy
caucasus
and
memory
thy
vulture
thou
wilt
find
oblivion
far
lonelier
than
this
peak
behold
thy
destiny
thou
it
much
that
i
should
brave
thee
miserable
god
but
i
have
braved
a
mightier
than
thou
even
the
tempting
of
this
soaring
heart
which
might
have
made
me
scarcely
less
than
thou
a
god
among
my
brethren
weak
and
blind
scarce
less
than
thou
a
pitiable
thing
to
be
into
darkness
soon
but
now
i
am
above
thee
for
thou
art
the
bungling
workmanship
of
fear
the
block
that
awes
the
swart
barbarian
but
i
am
what
myself
have
made
a
nature
wise
with
finding
in
itself
the
types
of
all
with
watching
from
the
dim
verge
of
the
time
what
things
to
be
are
visible
in
the
gleams
thrown
forward
on
them
from
the
luminous
past
wise
with
the
history
of
its
own
frail
heart
with
reverence
and
sorrow
and
with
love
broad
as
the
world
for
freedom
and
for
man
thou
and
all
strength
shall
crumble
except
love
by
whom
and
for
whose
glory
ye
shall
cease
and
when
thou
art
but
a
dim
moaning
heard
from
out
the
pitiless
glooms
of
chaos
i
shall
be
a
power
and
a
memory
a
name
to
fright
all
tyrants
with
a
light
unsetting
as
the
a
great
voice
heard
in
the
breathless
pauses
of
the
fight
by
truth
and
freedom
ever
waged
with
wrong
clear
as
a
silver
trumpet
to
awake
huge
echoes
that
from
age
to
age
live
on
in
kindred
spirits
giving
them
a
sense
of
boundless
power
from
boundless
suffering
wrung
and
many
a
glazing
eye
shall
smile
to
see
the
memory
of
my
triumph
for
to
meet
wrong
with
endurance
and
to
overcome
the
present
with
a
heart
that
looks
beyond
are
triumph
like
a
prophet
eagle
perch
upon
the
sacred
banner
of
the
right
evil
springs
up
and
flowers
and
bears
no
seed
and
feeds
the
green
earth
with
its
swift
decay
leaving
it
richer
for
the
growth
of
truth
but
good
once
put
in
action
or
in
thought
like
a
strong
oak
doth
from
its
boughs
shed
down
the
ripe
germs
of
a
forest
thou
weak
god
shalt
fade
and
be
forgotten
but
this
soul
still
in
the
serene
abyss
in
every
heaving
shall
partake
that
grows
from
heart
to
heart
among
the
sons
of
men
as
the
ominous
hum
before
the
earthquake
runs
far
through
the
ægean
from
roused
isle
to
isle
foreboding
wreck
to
palaces
and
shrines
and
mighty
rents
in
many
a
cavernous
error
that
darkens
the
free
light
to
man
this
heart
unscarred
by
thy
grim
vulture
as
the
truth
grows
but
more
lovely
the
beaks
and
claws
of
harpies
blind
that
fain
would
soil
it
shall
in
all
the
throbbing
exultations
share
that
wait
on
freedom
triumphs
and
in
all
the
glorious
agonies
of
sharp
to
split
the
jagged
clouds
that
veil
the
future
showing
them
the
end
pain
thorny
crown
for
constancy
and
truth
girding
the
temples
like
a
wreath
of
stars
this
is
a
thought
that
like
a
fabled
laurel
makes
my
faith
and
thy
dread
bolts
fall
on
me
like
the
silent
flakes
of
snow
on
the
hoar
brows
of
aged
caucasus
but
o
thought
far
more
blissful
they
can
rend
this
cloud
of
flesh
and
make
my
soul
a
star
unleash
thy
crouching
thunders
now
o
jove
free
this
high
heart
which
a
poor
captive
long
doth
knock
to
be
let
forth
this
heart
which
still
in
its
invincible
manhood
overtops
thy
puny
godship
as
this
mountain
doth
the
pines
that
moss
its
roots
o
even
now
while
from
my
peak
of
suffering
i
look
down
beholding
with
a
gush
of
hope
the
sunrise
of
that
beauty
in
whose
face
shone
all
around
with
love
no
man
shall
look
but
straightway
like
a
god
he
is
uplift
unto
the
throne
long
empty
for
his
sake
and
clearly
oft
foreshadowed
in
wide
dreams
by
his
free
inward
nature
which
nor
thou
nor
any
anarch
after
thee
can
bind
from
working
its
great
doom
now
now
set
free
this
essence
not
to
die
but
to
become
part
of
that
awful
presence
which
doth
haunt
the
palaces
of
tyrants
to
hunt
off
with
its
grim
eyes
and
fearful
whisperings
and
hideous
sense
of
utter
loneliness
all
hope
of
safety
all
desire
of
peace
all
but
the
loathed
forefeeling
of
blank
death
part
of
that
spirit
which
doth
ever
brood
in
patient
calm
on
the
unpilfered
nest
of
man
deep
heart
till
mighty
thoughts
grow
fledged
to
sail
with
darkening
shadow
the
world
filling
with
dread
such
souls
as
dare
not
trust
in
the
unfailing
energy
of
good
until
they
swoop
and
their
pale
quarry
make
of
some
wrong
that
spirit
which
scatters
great
hopes
in
the
of
man
like
acorns
among
grain
to
grow
and
be
a
roof
for
freedom
in
all
coming
time
but
no
this
can
not
be
for
ages
yet
in
solitude
unbroken
shall
i
hear
the
angry
caspian
to
the
euxine
shout
and
euxine
answer
with
a
muffled
roar
on
either
side
storming
the
giant
walls
of
caucasus
with
leagues
of
climbing
foam
less
from
my
height
than
flakes
of
downy
snow
that
draw
back
baffled
but
to
hurl
again
snatched
up
in
wrath
and
horrible
turmoil
mountain
on
mountain
as
the
titans
erst
my
brethren
scaling
the
high
seat
of
jove
heaved
pelion
upon
ossa
shoulders
broad
in
vain
emprise
the
moon
will
come
and
go
with
her
monotonous
vicissitude
once
beautiful
when
i
was
free
to
walk
among
my
fellows
and
to
interchange
the
influence
benign
of
loving
eyes
but
now
by
aged
use
grown
wearisome
false
thought
most
false
for
how
could
i
endure
these
crawling
centuries
of
lonely
woe
unshamed
by
weak
complaining
but
for
thee
loneliest
save
me
of
all
created
things
astarte
my
best
comforter
with
thy
pale
smile
of
sad
benignity
year
after
year
will
pass
away
and
seem
to
me
in
mine
eternal
agony
but
as
the
shadows
of
dumb
summer
clouds
which
i
have
watched
so
often
darkening
the
vast
sarmatian
plain
at
first
but
with
still
swiftness
lessening
on
and
on
till
cloud
and
shadow
meet
and
mingle
where
the
gray
horizon
fades
into
the
sky
far
far
to
the
northward
yes
for
ages
yet
must
i
lie
here
upon
my
altar
huge
a
sacrifice
for
man
sorrow
will
be
as
it
hath
been
his
portion
endless
doom
while
the
immortal
with
the
mortal
linked
dreams
of
its
wings
and
pines
for
what
it
dreams
with
upward
yearn
unceasing
better
so
for
wisdom
is
meek
sorrow
patient
child
and
empire
over
self
and
all
the
deep
strong
charities
that
make
men
seem
like
gods
and
love
that
makes
them
be
gods
from
her
breasts
sucks
in
the
milk
that
makes
mankind
one
blood
good
never
comes
unmixed
or
so
it
seems
having
two
faces
as
some
images
are
carved
of
foolish
gods
one
face
is
ill
but
one
heart
lies
beneath
and
that
is
good
as
are
all
hearts
when
we
explore
their
depths
therefore
great
heart
bear
up
thou
art
but
type
of
what
all
lofty
spirits
endure
that
fain
would
win
men
back
to
strength
and
peace
through
love
each
hath
his
lonely
peak
and
on
each
heart
envy
or
scorn
or
hatred
tears
lifelong
with
vulture
beak
yet
the
high
soul
is
left
and
faith
which
is
but
hope
grown
wise
and
love
and
patience
which
at
last
shall
overcome
song
violet
sweet
violet
thine
eyes
are
full
of
tears
are
they
wet
even
yet
with
the
thought
of
other
years
or
with
gladness
are
they
full
for
the
night
so
beautiful
and
longing
for
those
spheres
of
my
youth
thou
wast
of
my
merry
youth
and
i
see
tearfully
all
the
fair
and
sunny
past
all
its
openness
and
truth
ever
fresh
and
green
in
thee
as
the
moss
is
in
the
sea
thy
little
heart
that
hath
with
love
grown
colored
like
the
sky
above
on
which
thou
lookest
ever
can
it
know
all
the
woe
of
hope
for
what
returneth
never
all
the
sorrow
and
the
longing
to
these
hearts
of
ours
belonging
out
on
it
no
foolish
pining
for
the
sky
dims
thine
eye
or
for
the
stars
so
calmly
shining
like
thee
let
this
soul
of
mine
take
hue
from
that
wherefor
i
long
and
high
serene
and
strong
not
satisfied
with
hoping
but
divine
violet
dear
violet
thy
blue
eyes
are
only
wet
with
joy
and
love
of
him
who
sent
thee
and
for
the
fulfilling
sense
of
that
glad
obedience
which
made
thee
all
that
nature
meant
thee
rosaline
thou
on
me
all
yesternight
thine
eyes
were
blue
thy
hair
was
bright
as
when
we
murmured
our
beneath
the
thick
stars
rosaline
thy
hair
was
braided
on
thy
head
as
on
the
day
we
two
were
wed
mine
eyes
scarce
knew
if
thou
wert
dead
but
my
shrunk
heart
knew
rosaline
the
ticked
behind
the
wall
the
blackness
rustled
like
a
pall
the
moaning
wind
did
rise
and
fall
among
the
bleak
pines
rosaline
my
heart
beat
thickly
in
mine
ears
the
lids
may
shut
out
fleshly
fears
but
still
the
spirit
sees
and
hears
its
eyes
are
lidless
rosaline
a
wildness
rushing
suddenly
a
knowing
some
is
nigh
a
wish
for
death
a
fear
to
die
is
not
this
vengeance
rosaline
a
loneliness
that
is
not
lone
a
love
quite
withered
up
and
gone
a
strong
soul
trampled
from
its
throne
what
wouldst
thou
further
rosaline
is
drear
such
moonless
nights
as
these
strange
sounds
are
out
upon
the
breeze
and
the
leaves
shiver
in
the
trees
and
then
thou
comest
rosaline
i
seem
to
hear
the
mourners
go
with
long
black
garments
trailing
slow
and
plumes
anodding
to
and
fro
as
once
i
heard
them
rosaline
thy
shroud
is
all
of
snowy
white
and
in
the
middle
of
the
night
thou
standest
moveless
and
upright
gazing
upon
me
rosaline
there
is
no
sorrow
in
thine
eyes
but
evermore
that
meek
surprise
o
god
thy
gentle
spirit
tries
to
deem
me
guiltless
rosaline
above
thy
grave
the
robin
sings
and
swarms
of
bright
and
happy
things
flit
all
about
with
sunlit
wings
but
i
am
cheerless
rosaline
the
violets
on
the
hillock
toss
the
gravestone
is
with
moss
for
nature
feels
not
any
loss
but
i
am
cheerless
rosaline
i
did
not
know
when
thou
wast
dead
a
blackbird
whistling
overhead
thrilled
through
my
brain
i
would
have
fled
but
dared
not
leave
thee
rosaline
the
sun
rolled
down
and
very
soon
like
a
great
fire
the
awful
moon
rose
stained
with
blood
and
then
a
swoon
crept
chilly
me
rosaline
the
stars
came
out
and
one
by
one
each
angel
from
his
silver
throne
looked
down
and
saw
what
i
had
done
i
dared
not
hide
me
rosaline
i
crouched
i
feared
thy
corpse
would
cry
against
me
to
god
quiet
sky
i
thought
i
saw
the
blue
lips
try
to
utter
something
rosaline
i
waited
with
a
maddened
grin
to
hear
that
voice
all
icy
thin
slide
forth
and
tell
my
deadly
sin
to
hell
and
heaven
rosaline
but
no
voice
came
and
then
it
seemed
that
if
the
very
corpse
had
screamed
the
sound
like
sunshine
glad
had
streamed
through
that
dark
stillness
rosaline
and
then
amid
the
silent
night
i
screamed
with
horrible
delight
and
in
my
brain
an
awful
light
did
seem
to
crackle
rosaline
it
is
my
curse
sweet
memories
fall
from
me
like
snow
and
only
all
of
that
one
night
like
cold
worms
crawl
my
doomed
heart
over
rosaline
why
wilt
thou
haunt
me
with
thine
eyes
wherein
such
blessed
memories
such
pitying
forgiveness
lies
than
hate
more
bitter
rosaline
woe
me
i
know
that
love
so
high
as
thine
true
soul
could
never
die
and
with
mean
clay
in
churchyard
lie
would
it
might
be
so
rosaline
the
shepherd
of
king
admetus
there
came
a
youth
upon
the
earth
some
thousand
years
ago
whose
slender
hands
were
nothing
worth
whether
to
plough
or
reap
or
sow
upon
an
empty
he
stretched
some
chords
and
drew
music
that
made
men
bosoms
swell
fearless
or
brimmed
their
eyes
with
dew
then
king
admetus
one
who
had
pure
taste
by
right
divine
decreed
his
singing
not
too
bad
to
hear
between
the
cups
of
wine
and
so
with
being
soothed
into
a
sweet
three
times
his
kingly
beard
he
smoothed
and
made
him
viceroy
his
sheep
his
words
were
simple
words
enough
and
yet
he
used
them
so
that
what
in
other
mouths
was
rough
in
his
seemed
musical
and
low
men
called
him
but
a
shiftless
youth
in
whom
no
good
they
saw
and
yet
unwittingly
in
truth
they
made
his
careless
words
their
law
they
knew
not
how
he
learned
at
all
for
idly
hour
by
hour
he
sat
and
watched
the
dead
leaves
fall
or
mused
upon
a
common
flower
it
seemed
the
loveliness
of
things
did
teach
him
all
their
use
for
in
mere
weeds
and
stones
and
springs
he
found
a
healing
power
profuse
men
granted
that
his
speech
was
wise
but
when
a
glance
they
caught
of
his
slim
grace
and
woman
eyes
they
laughed
and
called
him
yet
after
he
was
dead
and
gone
and
his
memory
dim
earth
seemed
more
sweet
to
live
upon
more
full
of
love
because
of
him
and
day
by
day
more
holy
grew
each
spot
where
he
had
trod
till
only
knew
their
brother
as
a
god
the
token
it
is
a
mere
wild
rosebud
quite
sallow
now
and
dry
yet
there
something
wondrous
in
it
some
gleams
of
days
gone
by
dear
sights
and
sounds
that
are
to
me
the
very
moons
of
memory
and
stir
my
heart
blood
far
below
its
waves
of
joy
and
woe
lips
must
fade
and
roses
wither
all
sweet
times
be
they
only
smile
and
murmuring
thither
stay
with
us
no
more
and
yet
ofttimes
a
look
or
smile
forgotten
in
a
kiss
while
years
after
from
the
dark
will
start
and
flash
across
the
trembling
heart
thou
hast
given
me
many
roses
but
never
one
like
this
both
sense
and
spirit
with
such
a
deep
wild
bliss
we
must
have
instincts
that
glean
up
sparse
drops
of
this
life
in
the
cup
whose
taste
shall
give
us
all
that
we
can
prove
of
immortality
earth
stablest
things
are
shadows
and
in
the
life
to
come
haply
some
trifle
may
tell
of
this
old
home
as
now
sometimes
we
seem
to
find
in
a
dark
crevice
of
the
mind
some
relic
which
long
pondered
hints
faintly
at
a
life
before
an
incident
in
a
railroad
car
he
spoke
of
burns
men
rude
and
rough
pressed
round
to
hear
the
praise
of
one
whose
heart
was
made
of
manly
simple
stuff
as
homespun
as
their
own
and
when
he
read
they
forward
leaned
drinking
with
thirsty
hearts
and
ears
his
songs
whom
glory
never
weaned
from
humble
smiles
and
tears
slowly
there
grew
a
tender
awe
faces
brown
and
hard
as
if
in
him
who
read
they
felt
and
saw
some
presence
of
the
bard
it
was
a
sight
for
sin
and
wrong
and
slavish
tyranny
to
see
a
sight
to
make
our
faith
more
pure
and
strong
in
high
humanity
i
thought
these
men
will
carry
hence
promptings
their
former
life
above
and
something
of
a
finer
reverence
for
beauty
truth
and
love
god
scatters
love
on
every
side
freely
among
his
children
all
and
always
hearts
are
lying
open
wide
wherein
some
grains
may
fall
there
is
no
wind
but
soweth
seeds
of
a
more
true
and
open
life
which
burst
into
deeds
with
wayside
beauty
rife
we
find
within
these
souls
of
ours
some
wild
germs
of
a
higher
birth
which
in
the
poet
tropic
heart
bear
flowers
whose
fragrance
fills
the
earth
within
the
hearts
of
all
men
lie
these
promises
of
wider
bliss
which
blossom
into
hopes
that
can
not
die
in
sunny
hours
like
this
all
that
hath
been
majestical
in
life
or
death
since
time
began
is
native
in
the
simple
heart
of
all
the
angel
heart
of
man
and
thus
among
the
untaught
poor
great
deeds
and
feelings
find
a
home
that
cast
in
shadow
all
the
golden
lore
of
classic
greece
and
rome
o
mighty
of
man
thou
art
in
low
or
high
thy
skiey
arches
with
exulting
span
infinity
all
thoughts
that
mould
the
age
begin
deep
down
within
the
primitive
soul
and
from
the
many
slowly
upward
win
to
one
who
grasps
the
whole
in
his
wide
brain
the
feeling
deep
that
struggled
on
the
many
tongue
swells
to
a
tide
of
thought
whose
surges
leap
the
weak
thrones
of
wrong
all
thought
begins
in
feeling
wide
in
the
great
mass
its
base
is
hid
and
narrowing
up
to
thought
stands
glorified
a
moveless
pyramid
nor
is
he
far
astray
who
deems
that
every
hope
which
rises
and
grows
broad
in
the
world
heart
by
ordered
impulse
streams
from
the
great
heart
of
god
god
wills
man
hopes
in
common
souls
hope
is
but
vague
and
undefined
till
from
the
poet
tongue
the
message
rolls
a
blessing
to
his
kind
never
did
poesy
appear
so
full
of
heaven
to
me
as
when
i
saw
how
it
would
pierce
through
pride
and
fear
to
the
lives
of
coarsest
men
it
may
be
glorious
to
write
thoughts
that
shall
glad
the
two
or
three
high
souls
like
those
far
stars
that
come
in
sight
once
in
a
century
but
better
far
it
is
to
speak
one
simple
word
which
now
and
then
shall
waken
their
free
nature
in
the
weak
and
friendless
sons
of
men
to
write
some
earnest
verse
or
line
which
seeking
not
the
praise
of
art
shall
make
a
clearer
faith
and
manhood
shine
in
the
untutored
heart
he
who
doth
this
in
verse
or
prose
may
be
forgotten
in
his
day
but
surely
shall
be
crowned
at
last
with
those
who
live
and
speak
for
aye
rhœcus
god
sends
his
teachers
unto
every
age
to
every
clime
and
every
race
of
men
with
revelations
fitted
to
their
growth
and
shape
of
mind
nor
gives
the
realm
of
truth
into
the
selfish
rule
of
one
sole
race
therefore
each
form
of
worship
that
hath
swayed
the
life
of
man
and
given
it
to
grasp
the
of
knowledge
reverence
enfolds
some
germs
of
goodness
and
of
right
else
never
had
the
eager
soul
which
loathes
the
slothful
down
of
pampered
ignorance
found
in
it
even
a
moment
fitful
rest
there
is
an
instinct
in
the
human
heart
which
makes
that
all
the
fables
it
hath
coined
to
justify
the
reign
of
its
belief
and
strengthen
it
by
beauty
right
divine
veil
in
their
inner
cells
a
mystic
gift
which
like
the
hazel
twig
in
faithful
hands
points
surely
to
the
hidden
springs
of
truth
for
as
in
nature
naught
is
made
in
vain
but
all
things
have
within
their
hull
of
use
a
wisdom
and
a
meaning
which
may
speak
of
spiritual
secrets
to
the
ear
of
spirit
so
in
the
heart
hath
fashioned
for
a
solace
to
itself
to
make
its
inspirations
suit
its
creed
and
from
the
niggard
hands
of
falsehood
wring
its
needful
food
of
truth
there
ever
is
a
sympathy
with
nature
which
reveals
not
less
than
her
own
works
pure
gleams
of
light
and
earnest
parables
of
inward
lore
hear
now
this
fairy
legend
of
old
greece
as
full
of
freedom
youth
and
beauty
still
as
the
immortal
freshness
of
that
grace
carved
for
all
ages
on
some
attic
frieze
a
youth
named
rhœcus
wandering
in
the
wood
saw
an
old
oak
just
trembling
to
its
fall
and
feeling
pity
of
so
fair
a
tree
he
propped
its
gray
trunk
with
admiring
care
and
with
a
thoughtless
footstep
loitered
on
but
as
he
turned
he
heard
a
voice
behind
that
murmured
rhœcus
was
as
if
the
leaves
stirred
by
a
passing
breath
had
murmured
it
and
while
he
paused
bewildered
yet
again
it
murmured
rhœcus
softer
than
a
breeze
he
started
and
beheld
with
dizzy
eyes
what
seemed
the
substance
of
a
happy
dream
stand
there
before
him
spreading
a
warm
glow
within
the
green
glooms
of
the
shadowy
oak
it
seemed
a
woman
shape
yet
all
too
fair
to
be
a
woman
and
with
eyes
too
meek
for
any
that
were
wont
to
mate
with
gods
all
naked
like
a
goddess
stood
she
there
and
like
a
goddess
all
too
beautiful
to
feel
the
earthliness
of
shame
rhœcus
i
am
the
dryad
of
this
tree
thus
she
began
dropping
her
words
serene
and
full
and
clear
as
drops
of
dew
and
with
it
i
am
doomed
to
live
and
die
the
rain
and
sunshine
are
my
caterers
nor
have
i
other
bliss
than
simple
life
now
ask
me
what
thou
wilt
that
i
can
give
and
with
a
thankful
joy
it
shall
be
thine
then
rhœcus
with
a
flutter
at
the
heart
yet
by
the
prompting
of
such
beauty
bold
answered
what
is
there
that
can
satisfy
the
endless
craving
of
the
soul
but
love
give
me
thy
love
or
but
the
hope
of
that
which
must
be
evermore
my
spirit
goal
after
a
little
pause
she
said
again
but
with
a
glimpse
of
sadness
in
her
tone
i
give
it
rhœcus
though
a
perilous
gift
an
hour
before
the
sunset
meet
me
here
and
straightway
there
was
nothing
he
could
see
but
the
green
glooms
beneath
the
shadowy
oak
and
not
a
sound
came
to
his
straining
ears
but
the
low
trickling
rustle
of
the
leaves
and
far
away
upon
an
emerald
slope
the
falter
of
an
idle
shepherd
pipe
now
in
those
days
of
simpleness
and
faith
men
did
not
think
that
happy
things
were
dreams
because
they
overstepped
the
narrow
bourne
of
likelihood
but
reverently
deemed
nothing
too
wondrous
or
too
beautiful
to
be
the
guerdon
of
a
daring
heart
so
rhœcus
made
no
doubt
that
he
was
blest
and
all
along
unto
the
city
gate
earth
seemed
to
spring
beneath
him
as
he
walked
the
clear
broad
sky
looked
bluer
than
its
wont
and
he
could
scarce
believe
he
had
not
wings
such
sunshine
seemed
to
glitter
through
his
veins
instead
of
blood
so
light
he
felt
and
strange
young
rhœcus
had
a
faithful
heart
enough
but
one
that
in
the
present
dwelt
too
much
and
taking
with
blithe
welcome
chance
gave
of
joy
was
wholly
bound
in
that
like
the
contented
peasant
of
a
vale
deemed
it
the
world
and
never
looked
beyond
so
haply
meeting
in
the
afternoon
some
comrades
who
were
playing
at
the
dice
he
joined
them
and
forgot
all
else
beside
the
dice
were
rattling
at
the
merriest
and
rhœcus
who
had
met
but
sorry
luck
just
laughed
in
triumph
at
a
happy
throw
when
through
the
room
there
hummed
a
yellow
bee
that
buzzed
about
his
ear
with
legs
as
if
to
light
and
rhœcus
laughed
and
said
feeling
how
red
and
flushed
he
was
with
loss
by
venus
does
he
take
me
for
a
rose
and
brushed
him
off
with
rough
impatient
hand
but
still
the
bee
came
back
and
thrice
again
rhœcus
did
beat
him
off
with
growing
wrath
then
through
the
window
flew
the
wounded
bee
and
rhœcus
tracking
him
with
angry
eyes
saw
a
sharp
of
thessaly
against
the
red
disc
of
the
setting
sun
and
instantly
the
blood
sank
from
his
heart
as
if
its
very
walls
had
caved
away
without
a
word
he
turned
and
rushing
forth
ran
madly
through
the
city
and
the
gate
and
the
plain
which
now
the
wood
long
shade
by
the
low
sun
thrown
forward
broad
and
dim
darkened
wellnigh
unto
the
city
wall
quite
spent
and
out
of
breath
he
reached
the
tree
and
listening
fearfully
he
heard
once
more
the
low
voice
murmur
rhœcus
close
at
hand
whereat
he
looked
around
him
but
could
see
naught
but
the
deepening
glooms
beneath
the
oak
then
sighed
the
voice
oh
rhœcus
nevermore
shalt
thou
behold
me
or
by
day
or
night
me
who
would
fain
have
blessed
thee
with
a
love
more
ripe
and
bounteous
than
ever
yet
filled
up
with
nectar
any
mortal
heart
but
thou
didst
scorn
my
humble
messenger
and
him
back
to
me
with
bruisèd
wings
we
spirits
only
show
to
gentle
eyes
we
ever
ask
an
undivided
love
and
he
who
scorns
the
least
of
nature
works
is
thenceforth
exiled
and
shut
out
from
all
farewell
for
thou
canst
never
see
me
more
then
rhœcus
beat
his
breast
and
groaned
aloud
and
cried
be
pitiful
forgive
me
yet
this
once
and
i
shall
never
need
it
more
alas
the
voice
returned
is
thou
art
blind
not
i
unmerciful
i
can
forgive
but
have
no
skill
to
heal
thy
spirit
eyes
only
the
soul
hath
power
itself
with
that
again
there
murmured
nevermore
and
rhœcus
after
heard
no
other
sound
except
the
rattling
of
the
oak
crisp
leaves
like
the
long
surf
upon
a
distant
shore
raking
the
pebbles
up
and
down
the
night
had
gathered
round
him
the
plain
the
city
sparkled
with
its
thousand
lights
and
sounds
of
revel
fell
upon
his
ear
harshly
and
like
a
curse
above
the
sky
with
all
its
bright
sublimity
of
stars
deepened
and
on
his
forehead
smote
the
breeze
beauty
was
all
around
him
and
delight
but
from
that
eve
he
was
alone
on
earth
the
falcon
i
know
a
falcon
swift
and
peerless
as
was
cradled
in
the
pine
no
bird
had
ever
eye
so
fearless
or
wings
so
strong
as
this
of
mine
the
winds
not
better
love
to
pilot
a
cloud
with
molten
gold
than
him
a
little
burning
islet
a
star
above
the
coming
sun
for
with
a
lark
heart
he
doth
tower
by
a
glorious
upward
instinct
drawn
no
bee
nestles
deeper
in
the
flower
than
he
in
the
bursting
rose
of
dawn
no
harmless
dove
no
bird
that
singeth
shudders
to
see
him
overhead
the
rush
of
his
fierce
swooping
bringeth
to
innocent
hearts
no
thrill
of
dread
let
fraud
and
wrong
and
baseness
shiver
for
still
between
them
and
the
sky
the
falcon
truth
hangs
poised
forever
and
marks
them
with
his
vengeful
eye
trial
i
whether
the
idle
prisoner
through
his
grate
watches
the
waving
of
the
small
which
having
colonized
its
rift
i
the
wall
takes
its
free
risk
of
good
or
evil
fate
and
from
the
sky
just
helmet
draws
its
lot
daily
of
shower
or
sunshine
cold
or
hot
whether
the
closer
captive
of
a
creed
cooped
up
from
birth
to
grind
out
endless
chaff
sees
through
his
the
noonday
laugh
and
feels
in
vain
his
crumpled
pinions
breed
whether
the
georgian
slave
look
up
and
mark
with
bellying
sails
puffed
full
the
tall
sink
northward
slowly
thou
alone
good
fair
only
thou
o
freedom
whose
desire
can
light
in
muddiest
souls
quick
seeds
of
fire
and
strain
life
chords
to
the
old
heroic
mood
ii
yet
are
there
other
gifts
more
fair
than
thine
nor
can
i
count
him
happiest
who
has
never
been
forced
with
his
own
hand
his
chains
to
sever
and
for
himself
find
out
the
way
divine
he
never
knew
the
aspirer
glorious
pains
he
never
earned
the
struggle
priceless
gains
o
block
by
block
with
sore
and
sharp
endeavor
lifelong
we
build
these
human
natures
up
into
a
temple
fit
for
freedom
shrine
and
trial
ever
consecrates
the
cup
wherefrom
we
pour
her
sacrificial
wine
a
requiem
ay
pale
and
silent
maiden
cold
as
thou
liest
there
thine
was
the
sunniest
nature
that
ever
drew
the
air
the
wildest
and
most
wayward
and
yet
so
gently
kind
thou
seemedst
but
to
body
a
breath
of
summer
wind
into
the
eternal
shadow
that
girds
our
life
around
into
the
infinite
silence
wherewith
death
shore
is
bound
thou
hast
gone
forth
belovèd
and
i
were
mean
to
weep
that
thou
hast
left
life
shallows
and
dost
possess
the
deep
thou
liest
low
and
silent
thy
heart
is
cold
and
still
thine
eyes
are
shut
forever
and
death
hath
had
his
will
he
loved
and
would
have
taken
i
loved
and
would
have
kept
we
strove
and
he
was
stronger
and
i
have
never
wept
let
him
possess
thy
body
thy
soul
is
still
with
me
more
sunny
and
more
gladsome
than
it
was
wont
to
be
thy
body
was
a
fetter
that
bound
me
to
the
flesh
thank
god
that
it
is
broken
and
now
i
live
afresh
now
i
can
see
thee
clearly
the
dusky
cloud
of
clay
that
hid
thy
starry
spirit
is
rent
and
blown
away
to
earth
i
give
thy
body
thy
spirit
to
the
sky
i
saw
its
bright
wings
growing
and
knew
that
thou
must
fly
now
i
can
love
thee
truly
for
nothing
comes
between
the
senses
and
the
spirit
the
seen
and
the
unseen
lifts
the
eternal
shadow
the
silence
bursts
apart
and
the
soul
boundless
future
is
present
in
my
heart
a
parable
worn
and
footsore
was
the
prophet
when
he
gained
the
holy
hill
god
has
left
the
earth
he
murmured
here
his
presence
lingers
still
god
of
all
the
olden
prophets
wilt
thou
speak
with
men
no
more
have
i
not
as
truly
served
thee
as
thy
chosen
ones
of
yore
hear
me
guider
of
my
fathers
lo
a
humble
heart
is
mine
by
thy
mercy
i
beseech
thee
grant
thy
servant
but
a
sign
bowing
then
his
head
he
listened
for
an
answer
to
his
prayer
no
loud
burst
of
thunder
followed
not
a
murmur
stirred
the
air
but
the
tuft
of
moss
before
him
opened
while
he
waited
yet
and
from
out
the
rock
hard
bosom
sprang
a
tender
violet
god
i
thank
thee
said
the
prophet
hard
of
heart
and
blind
was
i
looking
to
the
holy
mountain
for
the
gift
of
prophecy
still
thou
speakest
with
thy
children
freely
as
in
eld
sublime
humbleness
and
love
and
patience
still
give
empire
over
time
had
i
trusted
in
my
nature
and
had
faith
in
lowly
things
thou
thyself
wouldst
then
have
sought
me
and
set
free
my
spirit
wings
but
i
looked
for
signs
and
wonders
that
men
should
give
me
sway
thirsting
to
be
more
than
mortal
i
was
even
less
than
clay
ere
i
entered
on
my
journey
as
i
girt
my
loins
to
start
ran
to
me
my
little
daughter
the
beloved
of
my
heart
in
her
hand
she
held
a
flower
like
to
this
as
like
may
be
which
beside
my
very
threshold
she
had
plucked
and
brought
to
me
a
glance
behind
the
curtain
we
see
but
half
the
causes
of
our
deeds
seeking
them
wholly
in
the
outer
life
and
heedless
of
the
encircling
which
though
unseen
is
felt
and
sows
in
us
all
germs
of
pure
and
purposes
from
one
stage
of
our
being
to
the
next
we
pass
unconscious
a
slender
bridge
the
momentary
work
of
unseen
hands
which
crumbles
down
behind
us
looking
back
we
see
the
other
shore
the
gulf
between
and
marvelling
how
we
won
to
where
we
stand
content
ourselves
to
call
the
builder
chance
we
trace
the
wisdom
to
the
apple
fall
not
to
the
of
a
mighty
truth
which
for
long
ages
in
blank
chaos
dumb
yet
yearned
to
be
incarnate
and
had
found
at
last
a
spirit
meet
to
be
the
womb
from
which
it
might
be
born
to
bless
mankind
not
to
the
soul
of
newton
ripe
with
all
the
hoarded
thoughtfulness
of
earnest
years
and
waiting
but
one
ray
of
sunlight
more
to
blossom
fully
but
whence
came
that
ray
we
call
our
sorrows
destiny
but
ought
rather
to
name
our
high
successes
so
only
the
instincts
of
great
souls
are
fate
and
have
predestined
sway
all
other
things
except
by
leave
of
us
could
never
be
for
destiny
is
but
the
breath
of
god
still
moving
in
us
the
last
fragment
left
of
our
unfallen
nature
waking
oft
within
our
thought
to
beckon
us
beyond
the
narrow
circle
of
the
seen
and
known
and
always
tending
to
a
noble
end
as
all
things
must
that
overrule
the
soul
and
for
a
space
unseat
the
helmsman
will
the
fate
of
england
and
of
freedom
once
seemed
wavering
in
the
heart
of
one
plain
man
one
step
of
his
and
the
great
that
marks
the
destined
progress
of
the
world
in
the
eternal
round
from
wisdom
on
to
higher
wisdom
had
been
made
to
pause
a
hundred
years
that
step
he
did
not
take
he
knew
not
why
nor
we
but
only
god
and
lived
to
make
his
simple
oaken
chair
more
terrible
and
grandly
beautiful
more
full
of
majesty
than
any
throne
before
or
after
of
a
british
king
upon
the
pier
stood
two
men
looking
to
where
a
little
craft
lay
moored
swayed
by
the
lazy
current
of
the
thames
which
weltered
by
in
muddy
listlessness
grave
men
they
were
and
battlings
of
fierce
thought
had
trampled
out
all
softness
from
their
brows
and
ploughed
rough
furrows
there
before
their
time
for
another
crop
than
such
as
homebred
peace
sows
broadcast
in
the
willing
soil
of
youth
care
not
of
self
but
of
the
commonweal
had
robbed
their
eyes
of
youth
and
left
instead
a
look
of
patient
power
and
iron
will
and
something
fiercer
too
that
gave
broad
hint
of
the
plain
weapons
girded
at
their
sides
the
younger
had
an
aspect
of
command
not
such
as
trickles
down
a
slender
stream
in
the
shrunk
channel
of
a
great
descent
but
such
as
lies
entowered
in
heart
and
head
and
an
arm
prompt
to
do
the
of
both
his
was
a
brow
where
gold
were
out
of
place
and
yet
it
seemed
right
worthy
of
a
crown
though
he
despised
such
were
it
only
made
of
iron
or
some
serviceable
stuff
that
would
have
matched
his
sinewy
brown
face
the
elder
although
he
hardly
seemed
care
makes
so
little
of
some
five
short
years
had
a
clear
honest
face
whose
strength
was
mildened
by
the
scholar
wiser
heart
to
sober
courage
such
as
best
befits
the
unsullied
temper
of
a
mind
yet
so
remained
that
one
could
plainly
guess
the
hushed
volcano
smouldering
underneath
he
spoke
the
other
hearing
kept
his
gaze
still
fixed
as
on
some
problem
in
the
sky
o
cromwell
we
are
fallen
on
evil
times
there
was
a
day
when
england
had
wide
room
for
honest
men
as
well
as
foolish
kings
but
now
the
uneasy
stomach
of
the
time
turns
squeamish
at
them
both
therefore
let
us
seek
out
that
savage
clime
where
men
as
yet
are
free
there
sleeps
the
vessel
on
the
tide
her
languid
canvas
drooping
for
the
wind
give
us
but
that
and
what
need
we
to
fear
this
order
of
the
council
the
free
waves
will
not
say
no
to
please
a
wayward
king
nor
will
the
winds
turn
traitors
at
his
beck
all
things
are
fitly
cared
for
and
the
lord
will
watch
as
kindly
the
exodus
of
us
his
servants
now
as
in
old
time
we
have
no
cloud
or
fire
and
haply
we
may
not
pass
through
the
but
saved
or
lost
all
things
are
in
his
hand
so
spake
he
and
meantime
the
other
stood
with
wide
gray
eyes
still
reading
the
blank
air
as
if
upon
the
sky
blue
wall
he
saw
some
mystic
sentence
written
by
a
hand
such
as
of
old
made
pale
the
assyrian
king
girt
with
his
satraps
in
the
blazing
feast
hampden
a
moment
since
my
purpose
was
to
fly
with
thee
for
i
will
call
it
flight
nor
flatter
it
with
any
smoother
name
but
something
in
me
bids
me
not
to
go
and
i
am
one
thou
knowest
who
unmoved
by
what
the
weak
deem
omens
yet
give
heed
and
reverence
due
to
my
soul
whispers
of
warning
to
the
inner
ear
moreover
as
i
know
that
god
brings
round
his
purposes
in
ways
undreamed
by
us
and
makes
the
wicked
but
his
instruments
to
hasten
on
their
swift
and
sudden
fall
i
see
the
beauty
of
his
providence
in
the
king
order
blind
he
will
not
let
his
doom
part
from
him
but
must
bid
it
stay
as
were
a
cricket
whose
enlivening
chirp
he
loved
to
hear
beneath
his
very
hearth
why
should
we
fly
nay
why
not
rather
stay
and
rear
again
our
zion
crumbled
walls
not
as
of
old
the
walls
of
thebes
were
built
by
minstrel
twanging
but
if
need
should
be
with
the
more
potent
music
of
our
swords
thou
that
score
of
men
beyond
the
sea
claim
more
god
care
than
all
of
england
here
no
when
he
moves
his
arm
it
is
to
aid
whole
peoples
heedless
if
a
few
be
crushed
as
some
are
ever
when
the
destiny
of
man
takes
one
stride
onward
nearer
home
believe
it
is
the
mass
of
men
he
loves
and
where
there
is
most
sorrow
and
most
want
where
the
high
heart
of
man
is
trodden
down
the
most
is
not
because
he
hides
his
face
from
them
in
wrath
as
purblind
teachers
prate
not
so
there
most
is
he
for
there
is
he
most
needed
men
who
seek
for
fate
abroad
are
not
so
near
his
heart
as
they
who
dare
frankly
to
face
her
where
she
faces
them
on
their
own
threshold
where
their
souls
are
strong
to
grapple
with
and
throw
her
as
i
once
being
yet
a
boy
did
cast
this
puny
king
who
now
has
grown
so
dotard
as
to
deem
that
he
can
wrestle
with
an
angry
realm
and
throw
the
brawned
antæus
of
men
rights
no
hampden
they
have
conquered
fate
who
go
to
meet
her
as
will
i
freedom
hath
yet
a
work
for
me
to
do
so
speaks
that
inward
voice
which
never
yet
spake
falsely
when
it
urged
the
spirit
on
to
noble
deeds
for
country
and
mankind
and
for
success
i
ask
no
more
than
this
to
bear
unflinching
witness
to
the
truth
all
true
whole
men
succeed
for
what
is
worth
success
name
unless
it
be
the
thought
the
inward
surety
to
have
carried
out
a
noble
purpose
to
a
noble
end
although
it
be
the
gallows
or
the
block
is
only
falsehood
that
doth
ever
need
these
outward
shows
of
gain
to
bolster
her
be
it
we
prove
the
weaker
with
our
swords
truth
only
needs
to
be
for
once
spoke
out
and
there
such
music
in
her
such
strange
rhythm
as
makes
men
memories
her
joyous
slaves
and
clings
around
the
soul
as
the
sky
clings
round
the
mute
earth
forever
beautiful
and
if
only
to
burst
forth
more
divine
and
clear
get
but
the
truth
once
uttered
and
is
like
a
star
that
drops
into
its
place
and
which
once
circling
in
its
placid
round
not
all
the
tumult
of
the
earth
can
shake
what
should
we
do
in
that
small
colony
of
pinched
fanatics
who
would
rather
choose
freedom
to
clip
an
inch
more
from
their
hair
than
the
great
chance
of
setting
england
free
not
there
amid
the
stormy
wilderness
should
we
learn
wisdom
or
if
learned
what
room
to
put
it
into
act
else
worse
than
naught
we
learn
our
souls
more
tossing
for
an
hour
upon
this
huge
and
sea
of
human
thought
where
kingdoms
go
to
wreck
like
fragile
bubbles
yonder
in
the
stream
than
in
a
cycle
of
new
england
sloth
broke
only
by
some
petty
indian
war
or
quarrel
for
a
letter
more
or
less
in
some
hard
word
which
spelt
in
either
way
not
their
most
learned
clerks
can
understand
new
times
demand
new
measures
and
new
men
the
world
advances
and
in
time
outgrows
the
laws
that
in
our
fathers
day
were
best
and
doubtless
after
us
some
purer
scheme
will
be
shaped
out
by
wiser
men
than
we
made
wiser
by
the
steady
growth
of
truth
we
can
not
bring
utopia
by
force
but
better
almost
be
at
work
in
sin
than
in
a
brute
inaction
browse
and
sleep
no
man
is
born
into
the
world
whose
work
is
not
born
with
him
there
is
always
work
and
tools
to
work
withal
for
those
who
will
and
blessèd
are
the
horny
hands
of
toil
the
busy
world
shoves
angrily
aside
the
man
who
stands
with
arms
akimbo
set
until
occasion
tells
him
what
to
do
and
he
who
waits
to
have
his
task
marked
out
shall
die
and
leave
his
errand
unfulfilled
our
time
is
one
that
calls
for
earnest
deeds
reason
and
government
like
two
broad
seas
yearn
for
each
other
with
outstretched
arms
across
this
narrow
isthmus
of
the
throne
and
roll
their
white
surf
higher
every
day
one
age
moves
onward
and
the
next
builds
up
cities
and
gorgeous
palaces
where
stood
the
rude
log
huts
of
those
who
tamed
the
wild
rearing
from
out
the
forests
they
had
felled
the
goodly
framework
of
a
fairer
state
the
builder
trowel
and
the
settler
axe
are
seldom
wielded
by
the
selfsame
hand
ours
is
the
harder
task
yet
not
the
less
shall
we
receive
the
blessing
for
our
toil
from
the
choice
spirits
of
the
aftertime
my
soul
is
not
a
palace
of
the
past
where
outworn
creeds
like
rome
gray
senate
quake
hearing
afar
the
vandal
trumpet
hoarse
that
shakes
old
systems
with
a
the
time
is
ripe
and
for
change
then
let
it
come
i
have
no
dread
of
what
is
called
for
by
the
instinct
of
mankind
nor
think
i
that
god
world
will
fall
apart
because
we
tear
a
parchment
more
or
less
truth
is
eternal
but
her
effluence
with
endless
change
is
fitted
to
the
hour
her
mirror
is
turned
forward
to
reflect
the
promise
of
the
future
not
the
past
he
who
would
win
the
name
of
truly
great
must
understand
his
own
age
and
the
next
and
make
the
present
ready
to
fulfil
its
prophecy
and
with
the
future
merge
gently
and
peacefully
as
wave
with
wave
the
future
works
out
great
men
destinies
the
present
is
enough
for
common
souls
who
never
looking
forward
are
indeed
mere
clay
wherein
the
footprints
of
their
age
are
petrified
forever
better
those
who
lead
the
blind
old
giant
by
the
hand
from
out
the
pathless
desert
where
he
gropes
and
set
him
onward
in
his
darksome
way
i
do
not
fear
to
follow
out
the
truth
albeit
along
the
precipice
edge
let
us
speak
plain
there
is
more
force
in
names
than
most
men
dream
of
and
a
lie
may
keep
its
throne
a
whole
age
longer
if
it
skulk
behind
the
shield
of
some
name
let
us
call
tyrants
and
maintain
that
only
freedom
comes
by
grace
of
god
and
all
that
comes
not
by
his
grace
must
fall
for
men
in
earnest
have
no
time
to
waste
in
patching
for
the
naked
truth
i
will
have
one
more
grapple
with
the
man
charles
stuart
whom
the
boy
the
man
stands
not
in
awe
of
i
perchance
am
one
raised
up
by
the
almighty
arm
to
witness
some
great
truth
to
all
the
world
souls
destined
to
the
vulgar
lot
and
mould
the
world
unto
the
scheme
of
god
have
a
of
their
high
doom
as
men
are
known
to
shiver
at
the
heart
when
the
cold
shadow
of
some
coming
ill
creeps
slowly
their
spirits
unawares
hath
good
less
power
of
prophecy
than
ill
how
else
could
men
whom
god
hath
called
to
sway
earth
rudder
and
to
steer
the
bark
of
truth
beating
against
the
tempest
her
port
bear
all
the
mean
and
buzzing
grievances
the
petty
martyrdoms
wherewith
sin
strives
to
weary
out
the
tethered
hope
of
faith
the
sneers
the
unrecognizing
look
of
friends
who
worship
the
dead
corpse
of
old
king
custom
where
it
doth
lie
in
state
within
the
church
striving
to
cover
up
the
mighty
ocean
with
a
man
palm
and
making
even
the
truth
lie
for
them
holding
up
the
glass
reversed
to
make
the
hope
of
man
seem
farther
off
my
god
when
i
read
the
bitter
lives
of
men
whose
eager
hearts
were
quite
too
great
to
beat
beneath
the
cramped
mode
of
the
day
and
see
them
mocked
at
by
the
world
they
love
haggling
with
prejudice
for
pennyworths
of
that
reform
which
their
hard
toil
will
make
the
common
birthright
of
the
age
to
come
when
i
see
this
spite
of
my
faith
in
god
i
marvel
how
their
hearts
bear
up
so
long
nor
could
they
but
for
this
same
prophecy
this
inward
feeling
of
the
glorious
end
deem
me
not
fond
but
in
my
warmer
youth
ere
my
heart
bloom
was
soiled
and
brushed
away
i
had
great
dreams
of
mighty
things
to
come
of
conquest
whether
by
the
sword
or
pen
i
knew
not
but
some
conquest
i
would
have
or
else
swift
death
now
wiser
grown
in
years
i
find
youth
dreams
are
but
the
flutterings
of
those
strong
wings
whereon
the
soul
shall
soar
in
aftertime
to
win
a
starry
throne
and
so
i
cherish
them
for
they
were
lots
which
i
a
boy
cast
in
the
helm
of
fate
now
will
i
draw
them
since
a
man
right
hand
a
right
hand
guided
by
an
earnest
soul
with
a
true
instinct
takes
the
golden
prize
from
out
a
thousand
blanks
what
men
call
luck
is
the
prerogative
of
valiant
souls
the
fealty
life
pays
its
rightful
kings
the
helm
is
shaking
now
and
i
will
stay
to
pluck
my
lot
forth
it
were
sin
to
flee
so
they
two
turned
together
one
to
die
fighting
for
freedom
on
the
bloody
field
the
other
far
more
happy
to
become
a
name
earth
wears
forever
next
her
heart
one
of
the
few
that
have
a
right
to
rank
with
the
true
makers
for
his
spirit
wrought
order
from
chaos
proved
that
right
divine
dwelt
only
in
the
excellence
of
truth
and
far
within
old
darkness
hostile
lines
advanced
and
pitched
the
shining
tents
of
light
nor
shall
the
grateful
muse
forget
to
tell
that
not
the
least
among
his
many
claims
to
deathless
honor
he
was
milton
friend
a
man
not
second
among
those
who
lived
to
show
us
that
the
poet
lyre

footnote
a
for
the
leading
incidents
in
this
tale
i
am
indebted
to
the
very
valuable
algic
researches
of
henry
schoolcraft
esq
the
old
chief
feeling
now
his
end
called
his
two
eldest
children
to
his
side
and
gave
them
in
few
words
his
parting
charge
my
son
and
daughter
me
ye
see
no
more
the
happy
await
me
green
with
change
of
spring
and
summer
through
the
year
but
for
remembrance
after
i
am
gone
be
kind
to
little
sheemah
for
my
sake
weakling
he
is
and
young
and
knows
not
yet
to
set
the
trap
or
draw
the
seasoned
bow
therefore
of
both
your
loves
he
hath
more
need
and
he
who
needeth
love
to
love
hath
right
it
is
not
like
our
furs
and
stores
of
corn
whereto
we
claim
sole
title
by
our
toil
but
the
great
spirit
plants
it
in
our
hearts
and
waters
it
and
gives
it
sun
to
be
the
common
stock
and
heritage
of
all
therefore
be
kind
to
sheemah
that
yourselves
may
not
be
left
deserted
in
your
need
alone
beside
a
lake
their
wigwam
stood
far
from
the
other
dwellings
of
their
tribe
and
after
many
moons
the
loneliness
wearied
the
elder
brother
and
he
said
why
should
i
dwell
here
all
alone
shut
out
from
the
free
natural
joys
that
fit
my
age
lo
i
am
tall
and
strong
well
skilled
to
hunt
patient
of
toil
and
hunger
and
not
yet
have
seen
the
danger
which
i
dared
not
look
full
in
the
face
what
hinders
me
to
be
a
mighty
brave
and
chief
among
my
kin
so
taking
up
his
arrows
and
his
bow
as
if
to
hunt
he
journeyed
swiftly
on
until
he
gained
the
wigwams
of
his
tribe
where
choosing
out
a
bride
he
soon
forgot
in
all
the
fret
and
bustle
of
new
life
the
little
sheemah
and
his
father
charge
now
when
the
sister
found
her
brother
gone
and
that
for
many
days
he
came
not
back
she
wept
for
sheemah
more
than
for
herself
for
love
bides
longest
in
a
woman
heart
and
flutters
many
times
before
he
flies
and
then
doth
perch
so
nearly
that
a
word
may
lure
him
back
as
swift
and
glad
as
light
and
duty
lingers
even
when
love
is
gone
oft
looking
out
in
hope
of
his
return
and
after
duty
hath
been
driven
forth
then
selfishness
creeps
in
the
last
of
all
warming
her
lean
hands
at
the
lonely
hearth
and
crouching
the
embers
to
shut
out
whatever
paltry
warmth
and
light
are
left
with
avaricious
greed
from
all
beside
so
for
long
months
the
sister
hunted
wide
and
cared
for
little
sheemah
tenderly
but
daily
more
and
more
the
loneliness
grew
wearisome
and
to
herself
she
sighed
am
i
not
fair
at
least
the
glassy
pool
that
hath
no
cause
to
flatter
tells
me
so
but
o
how
flat
and
meaningless
the
tale
unless
it
tremble
on
a
lover
tongue
beauty
hath
no
true
glass
except
it
be
in
the
sweet
privacy
of
loving
eyes
thus
deemed
she
idly
and
forgot
the
lore
which
she
had
learned
of
nature
and
the
woods
that
beauty
chief
reward
is
to
itself
and
that
the
eyes
of
love
reflect
alone
the
inward
fairness
which
is
blurred
and
lost
unless
kept
clear
and
white
by
duty
care
so
she
went
forth
and
sought
the
haunts
of
men
and
being
wedded
in
her
household
cares
soon
like
the
elder
brother
quite
forgot
the
little
sheemah
and
her
father
charge
but
sheemah
left
alone
within
the
lodge
waited
and
waited
with
a
shrinking
heart
thinking
each
rustle
was
his
sister
step
till
hope
grew
less
and
less
and
then
went
out
and
every
sound
was
changed
from
hope
to
fear
few
sounds
there
were
the
dropping
of
a
nut
the
squirrel
chirrup
and
the
jay
harsh
scream
autumn
sad
remnants
of
blithe
summer
cheer
heard
at
long
intervals
seemed
but
to
make
the
dreadful
void
of
silence
silenter
soon
what
small
store
his
sister
left
was
gone
and
through
the
autumn
he
made
shift
to
live
on
roots
and
berries
gathered
in
much
fear
of
wolves
whose
ghastly
howl
he
heard
ofttimes
hollow
and
hungry
at
the
dead
of
night
but
winter
came
at
last
and
when
the
snow
for
gleaming
leagues
hill
and
plain
spread
its
unbroken
silence
over
all
made
bold
by
hunger
he
was
fain
to
glean
more
sick
at
heart
than
ruth
and
all
alone
after
the
harvest
of
the
merciless
wolf
grim
boaz
who
and
gaunt
yet
feared
a
thing
more
wild
and
starving
than
himself
till
by
degrees
the
wolf
and
he
grew
friends
and
shared
together
all
the
winter
through
late
in
the
spring
when
all
the
ice
was
gone
the
elder
brother
fishing
in
the
lake
upon
whose
edge
his
father
wigwam
stood
heard
a
low
moaning
noise
upon
the
shore
half
like
a
child
it
seemed
half
like
a
wolf
and
straightway
there
was
something
in
his
heart
that
said
it
is
thy
brother
sheemah
voice
so
paddling
swiftly
to
the
bank
he
saw
within
a
little
thicket
close
at
hand
a
child
that
seemed
fast
changing
to
a
wolf
from
the
neck
downward
gray
with
shaggy
hair
that
still
crept
on
and
upward
as
he
looked
the
face
was
turned
away
but
well
he
knew
that
it
was
sheemah
even
his
brother
face
then
with
his
trembling
hands
he
hid
his
eyes
and
bowed
his
head
so
that
he
might
not
see
the
first
look
of
his
brother
eyes
and
cried
o
sheemah
o
my
brother
speak
to
me
dost
thou
not
know
me
that
i
am
thy
brother
come
to
me
little
sheemah
thou
shalt
dwell
with
me
henceforth
and
know
no
care
or
want
sheemah
was
silent
for
a
space
as
if
were
hard
to
summon
up
a
human
voice
and
when
he
spake
the
sound
was
of
a
wolf
i
know
thee
not
nor
art
thou
what
thou
i
have
none
other
brethren
than
the
wolves
and
till
thy
heart
be
changed
from
what
it
is
thou
art
not
worthy
to
be
called
their
kin
then
groaned
the
other
with
a
choking
tongue
alas
my
heart
is
changed
right
bitterly
is
shrunk
and
parched
within
me
even
now
and
looking
upward
fearfully
he
saw
only
a
wolf
that
shrank
away
and
ran
ugly
and
fierce
to
hide
among
the
woods

down

jostle

to
fling
themselves
upon
that
unknown
shore
their

familiar
since
the

of

whither
this
foredoomed
life
is
guided
on
to
sway
on

hushed

one
glittering

then
to

fulfilled
how
lonely
is
the

perpetual

the
melancholy
wash
of
endless

the
sigh
of
some
grim
monster
undescried
on
the
canvas

shifting
on
his
uneasy
pillow

yet
night
brings
more
companions
than

to
this
drear
waste
new
constellations

and
fairer

with
whose
calm
height
my
soul
finds
nearer
sympathy
than
with
my

of
earthen
souls
whose
vision
scanty
ring
makes
me
its
prisoner
to
beat
my
wings
against
the
cold
bars
of
their
unbelief
knowing
in
vain
my
own
free
heaven
beyond
o
god
this
world
so
crammed
with
eager
life
that
comes
and
goes
and
wanders
back
to
silence
like
the
idle
wind
which
yet
man
shaping
mind
can
make
his
drudge
to
swell
the
longing
sails
of
highest
endeavor
this
mad
unthrift
world
which
every
hour
throws
life
enough
away
to
make
her
deserts
kind
and
hospitable
lets
her
great
destinies
be
waved
aside
by
smooth
formal
infidels
who
weigh
the
god
they
not

wrinkled
with

and
loose
upon

power

the

of
this
great
enterprise
which
without

would
stiffen
in
swift
death
this
have
i
mused
on
since
mine
eye
could
first
among
the
stars
distinguish
and
with
joy
rest
on
that
pharos
of
the
north
on
some
blue
promontory
of
heaven
lighted
that
juts
far
out
into
the
upper
sea
to
this
one
hope
my
heart
hath
clung
for
years
as
would
a
foundling
to
the
talisman
hung
round
his
neck
by
hands
he
knew
not
whose
a
poor
vile
thing
and
dross
to
all
beside
yet
he
therein
can
feel
a
virtue
left
by
the
sad
pressure
of
a
mother
hand
and
unto
him
it
still
is
tremulous
with
palpitating
haste
and
wet
with
tears
the
key
to
him
of
hope
and
humanness
the
coarse
shell
of
life
pearl
expectancy
this
hope
hath
been
to
me
for
love
and
fame
hath
made
me
wholly
lonely
on
the
earth
building
me
up
as
in
a
tower
wherewith
enwalled
my
watching
spirit
burned
conquering
its
little
island
from
the
dark
sole
as
a
scholar
lamp
and
heard
men
steps
in
the
far
hurry
of
the
outward
world
pass
dimly
forth
and
back
sounds
heard
in
dream
as
ganymede
by
the
eagle
was
snatched
up
from
the
gross
sod
to
be
jove
cupbearer
so
was
i
lifted
by
my
great
design
and
who
hath
trod
olympus
from
his
eye
fades
not
that
broader
outlook
of
the

his
life
low

and
that
olympian
spectre
of
the

looms

his
soul
from
meaner
heights
of
doom
had
but
the
shadow
of
the
thunderer
bird
flashing
athwart
my
spirit
made
of
me
a

comes
back
to
ask
its
plighted
troth
again
still
watches
round
its
grave
the
unlaid
ghost
of
a
dead
virtue
and
makes
other
hopes
save
that
implacable
one
seem
thin
and
bleak
as

of

trees
upon

bound
freezing
there
by

other

perplexed
their

her

twine
in

of

a

mistress
make
whom
i
would
woo
to
meet
me
privily

underneath
the
stars
or
when
the
moon
flecked
all
the

with
scattered
pearls
o
days

tames
to
fawning
down
the
surly
fell
of
ocean

neck
i
know
not
when
this
hope
enthralled
me
first
but
from
my
boyhood
up
i
loved
to
hear
the
of
the
apennine
murmur
their
hoary
legends
of
the
sea

in
vision
clear
beheld
the
sudden
dark
of
tropic
night
shut
down
the
huge
whisper
of
great
watery
wastes
the
while
a
pair
of
herons
trailingly
flapped
inland
where
some
river
hurled
the
yellow
spoil
of
unconjectured
realms
far
through
a
gulf
green
silence
never
scarred
by
any
but
the
northwind
hurrying
keels
and
not
the
pines
alone
all
sights
and
sounds
to
my
heart
paid
fealty
and
catered
for
it
as
the
cretan
bees
brought
honey
to
the
baby
jupiter
who
in
his
soft
hand
crushed
a
violet
foremusing
the
rough
thunder
gripe
then
did
i
entertain
the
poet
song
my
great
idea
guest
and
passing
that
iron
bridge
the
tuscan
built
to
hell
i
heard
ulysses
tell
of
whose
adamantine
links
his
manacles
the
western
main
shook
growling
and
still
gnawed
i
brooded
on
the
wise
athenian
tale
of
happy
atlantis
and
heard
björne
keel
crunch
the
gray
pebbles
of
the
vinland
shore
for
i
believed
the
poets
it
is
they
who
utter
wisdom
from
the
central
deep
and
listening
to
the
inner
flow
of
things
speak
to
the
age
out
of
eternity
ah
me
old
hermits
sought
for
solitude
in
caves
and
desert
places
of
the
earth
where
their
own
was
the
only
stir
of
living
thing
that
comforted
the
year
but
the
bald
of
simeon
in
midnight
blankest
waste
were
populous
matched
with
the
isolation
drear
and
deep
of
him
who
pines
among
the
swarm
of
men
at
once
a
new
thought
king
and
prisoner
feeling
the
truer
life
within
his
life
the
fountain
of
his
spirit
prophecy
sinking
away
and
wasting
drop
by
drop
in
the
ungrateful
sands
of
sceptic
ears
he
in
the
of
untrod
woods
doth
walk
a
king
for
him
the
cell
widens
beyond
the
circles
of
the
stars
and
all
the
sceptred
spirits
of
the
past
come
thronging
in
to
greet
him
as
their
peer
but
in
the
glare
and
throng
he
sits
apart
an
exile
and
his
brow
aches
with
the
mocking
memory
of
its
crown
but
to
the
spirit
select
there
is
no
choice
he
can
not
say
this
will
i
do
or
that
for
the
cheap
means
putting
heaven
ends
in
pawn
and
bartering
his
bleak
rocks
the
freehold
stern
of
destiny
for
smoother
fields
that
yield
no
crop
of
will
a
hand
is
stretched
to
him
from
out
the
dark
which
grasping
without
question
he
is
led
where
there
is
work
that
he
must
do
for
god
the
trial
still
is
the
strength
complement
and
the
uncertain
dizzy
path
that
scales
the
sheer
heights
of
supremest
purposes
is
steeper
to
the
angel
than
the
child
chances
have
laws
as
fixed
as
planets
have
and
disappointment
dry
and
bitter
root
envy
harsh
berries
and
the
choking
pool
of
the
world
scorn
are
the
right
to
the
tough
hearts
that
pioneer
their
kind
and
break
a
pathway
to
those
unknown
realms
that
in
the
earth
broad
shadow
lie
enthralled
endurance
is
the
crowning
quality
and
patience
all
the
passion
of
great
hearts
these
are
their
stay
and
when
the
leaden
world
sets
its
hard
face
against
their
fateful
thought
and
brute
strength
like
a
scornful
conqueror
clangs
his
huge
mace
down
in
the
other
scale
the
inspired
soul
but
flings
his
patience
in
and
slowly
that
outweighs
the
ponderous
globe
one
faith
against
a
whole
earth
unbelief
one
soul
against
the
flesh
of
all
mankind
thus
ever
seems
it
when
my
soul
can
hear
the
voice
that
errs
not
then
my
triumph
gleams
the
blank
ocean
beckoning
and
all
night
my
heart
flies
on
before
me
as
i
sail
far
on
i
see
my
lifelong
enterprise
which
rose
like
ganges
mid
the
freezing
snows
of
a
world
sordidness
sweep
broadening
down
and
gathering
to
itself
a
thousand
streams
grow
sacred
ere
it
mingle
with
the
sea
i
see
the
ungated
wall
of
chaos
old
with
blocks
cyclopean
hewn
of
solid
night
fade
like
a
wreath
of
unreturning
mist
before
the
irreversible
feet
of
light
and
lo
with
what
clear
omen
in
the
east
on
day
gray
threshold
stands
the
eager
dawn
like
young
leander
rosy
from
the
sea
glowing
at
hero
lattice
one
day
more
these
muttering
shoalbrains
leave
the
helm
to
me
god
let
me
not
in
their
dull
ooze
be
stranded
let
not
this
one
frail
bark
to
hollow
which
i
have
dug
out
the
pith
and
sinewy
heart
of
my
aspiring
life
fair
trunk
be
so
cast
up
to
warp
and
blacken
in
the
sun
just
as
the
opposing
wind
whistle
off
his
mates
and
from
the
leaning
mast
fortune
full
sail
strains
forward
one
poor
day
remember
whose
and
not
how
short
it
is
it
is
god
day
it
is
columbus
a
lavish
day
one
day
with
life
and
heart
is
more
than
time
enough
to
find
a
world
an
incident
of
the
fire
at
hamburg
the
tower
of
old
saint
nicholas
soared
upward
to
the
skies
like
some
huge
piece
of
nature
make
the
growth
of
centuries
you
could
not
deem
its
crowding
spires
a
work
of
human
art
they
seemed
to
struggle
lightward
from
a
sturdy
living
heart
not
nature
self
more
freely
speaks
in
crystal
or
in
oak
than
through
the
pious
builder
hand
in
that
gray
pile
she
spoke
and
as
from
acorn
springs
the
oak
so
freely
and
alone
sprang
from
his
heart
this
hymn
to
god
sung
in
obedient
stone
it
seemed
a
wondrous
freak
of
chance
so
perfect
yet
so
rough
a
whim
of
nature
crystallized
slowly
in
granite
tough
the
thick
spires
yearned
towards
the
sky
in
quaint
harmonious
lines
and
in
broad
sunlight
basked
and
slept
like
a
grove
of
blasted
pines
never
did
rock
or
stream
or
tree
lay
claim
with
better
right
to
all
the
adorning
sympathies
of
shadow
and
of
light
and
in
that
forest
petrified
as
forester
there
dwells
stout
herman
the
old
sacristan
sole
lord
of
all
its
bells
surge
leaping
after
surge
the
fire
roared
onward
red
as
blood
till
half
of
hamburg
lay
engulfed
beneath
the
eddying
flood
for
miles
away
the
fiery
spray
poured
down
its
deadly
rain
and
back
and
forth
the
billows
sucked
and
paused
and
burst
again
from
square
to
square
with
tiger
leaps
panted
the
lustful
fire
the
air
to
leeward
shuddered
with
the
gasps
of
its
desire
and
church
and
palace
which
even
now
stood
whelmed
but
to
the
knee
lift
their
black
roofs
like
breakers
lone
amid
the
whirling
sea
up
in
his
tower
old
herman
sat
and
watched
with
quiet
look
his
soul
had
trusted
god
too
long
to
be
at
last
forsook
he
could
not
fear
for
surely
god
a
pathway
would
unfold
through
this
red
sea
for
faithful
hearts
as
once
he
did
of
old
but
scarcely
can
he
cross
himself
or
on
his
good
saint
call
before
the
sacrilegious
flood
the
churchyard
wall
and
ere
a
half
was
said
mid
smoke
and
crackling
glare
his
island
tower
scarce
juts
its
head
above
the
wide
despair
upon
the
peril
desperate
peak
his
heart
stood
up
sublime
his
first
thought
was
for
god
above
his
next
was
for
his
chime
sing
now
and
make
your
voices
heard
in
hymns
of
praise
cried
he
as
did
the
israelites
of
old
safe
walking
through
the
sea
through
this
red
sea
our
god
hath
made
the
pathway
safe
to
shore
our
promised
land
stands
full
in
sight
shout
now
as
before
and
as
the
tower
came
crushing
down
the
bells
in
clear
accord
pealed
forth
the
grand
old
german
hymn
all
good
souls
praise
the
lord
the
sower
i
saw
a
sower
walking
slow
across
the
earth
from
east
to
west
his
hair
was
white
as
mountain
snow
his
head
drooped
forward
on
his
breast
with
shrivelled
hands
he
flung
his
seed
nor
ever
turned
to
look
behind
of
sight
or
sound
he
took
no
heed
it
seemed
he
was
both
deaf
and
blind
his
dim
face
showed
no
soul
beneath
yet
in
my
heart
i
felt
a
stir
as
if
i
looked
upon
the
sheath
that
once
had
clasped
excalibur
i
heard
as
still
the
seed
he
cast
how
crooning
to
himself
he
sung
i
sow
again
the
holy
past
the
happy
days
when
i
was
young
then
all
was
wheat
without
a
tare
then
all
was
righteous
fair
and
true
and
i
am
he
whose
thoughtful
care
shall
plant
the
old
world
in
the
new
the
fruitful
germs
i
scatter
free
with
busy
hand
while
all
men
sleep
in
europe
now
from
sea
to
sea
the
nations
bless
me
as
they
reap
then
i
looked
back
along
his
path
and
heard
the
clash
of
steel
on
steel
where
man
faced
man
in
deadly
wrath
while
clanged
the
tocsin
hurrying
peal
the
sky
with
burning
towns
flared
red
nearer
the
noise
of
fighting
rolled
and
brothers
blood
by
brothers
shed
crept
curdling
over
pavements
cold
then
marked
i
how
each
germ
of
truth
which
through
the
dotard
fingers
ran
was
mated
with
a
dragon
tooth
whence
there
sprang
up
an
armed
man
i
shouted
but
he
could
not
hear
made
signs
but
these
he
could
not
see
and
still
without
a
doubt
or
fear
broadcast
he
scattered
anarchy
long
to
my
straining
ears
the
blast
brought
faintly
back
the
words
he
sung
i
sow
again
the
holy
past
the
happy
days
when
i
was
young
hunger
and
cold
sisters
two
all
praise
to
you
with
your
faces
pinched
and
blue
to
the
poor
man
you
been
true
from
of
old
you
can
speak
the
keenest
word
you
are
sure
of
being
heard
from
the
point
you
never
stirred
hunger
and
cold
let
sleek
statesmen
temporize
palsied
are
their
shifts
and
lies
when
they
meet
your
bloodshot
eyes
grim
and
bold
policy
you
set
at
naught
in
their
traps
you
not
be
caught
you
too
honest
to
be
bought
hunger
and
cold
bolt
and
bar
the
while
the
mass
of
men
are
poor
naked
truth
grows
more
and
more
uncontrolled
you
had
never
yet
i
guess
any
praise
for
bashfulness
you
can
visit
sans
hunger
and
cold
while
the
music
fell
and
rose
and
the
dance
reeled
to
its
close
where
her
round
of
costly
woes
fashion
strolled
i
beheld
with
shuddering
fear
wolves
eyes
through
the
windows
peer
little
dream
they
you
are
near
hunger
and
cold
when
the
toiler
heart
you
clutch
conscience
is
not
valued
much
he
recks
not
a
bloody
smutch
on
his
gold
everything
to
you
defers
you
are
potent
reasoners
at
your
whisper
treason
stirs
hunger
and
cold
rude
comparisons
you
draw
words
refuse
to
sate
your
maw
your
gaunt
limbs
the
cobweb
law
can
not
hold
you
not
clogged
with
foolish
pride
but
can
seize
a
right
denied
somehow
god
is
on
your
side
hunger
and
cold
you
respect
no
hoary
wrong
more
for
having
triumphed
long
its
past
victims
haggard
throng
from
the
mould
you
unbury
swords
and
spears
weaker
are
than
poor
men
tears
weaker
than
your
silent
years
hunger
and
cold
let
them
guard
both
hall
and
bower
through
the
window
you
will
glower
patient
till
your
reckoning
hour
shall
be
tolled
cheeks
are
pale
but
hands
are
red
guiltless
blood
may
chance
be
shed
but
ye
must
and
will
be
fed
hunger

some

the

told
devil
theories
are
these
stifling
hope
and
love
and
peace
framed
your
hideous
lusts
to

hunger
and

scatter
ashes
on
thy

sorrow
shed
earth
and
be
by
pity
led
to
love
fold
ere
they
block
the

hunger

the

what

your

in

your

the

of
almighty
thought
the
titles

the
wise
and
brave
to
a
far
up
on
katahdin
thou
towerest
with
the
distance
and
vast
like
a
cloud
the
lowlands
thou
lowerest
that
hangs
poised
on
a
lull
in
the
blast
to
its
fall
leaning
awful
in
the
storm
like
a
prophet
thou
singest
and
tossest
thy
branches
thy
heart
with
the
terror
is
gladdened
thou
forebodest
the
dread
avalanches
when
whole
mountains
swoop
valeward
in
the
calm
thou
the
valleys
with
thine
arms
as
if
blessings
imploring
like
an
old
king
led
forth
from
his
palace
when
his
people
to
battle
are
pouring
from
the
city
beneath
him
to
the
lumberer
asleep
thy
glooming
thou
dost
sing
of
wild
billows
in
motion
till
he
longs
to
be
swung
mid
their
booming
in
the
tents
of
the
arabs
of
ocean
whose
finned
isles
are
their
cattle
for
the
gale
snatches
thee
for
his
lyre
with
mad
hand
crashing
melody
frantic
while
he
pours
forth
his
mighty
desire
to
leap
down
on
the
eager
atlantic
whose
arms
stretch
to
his
playmate
the
wild
storm
makes
his
lair
in
thy
branches
preying
thence
on
the
continent
under
like
a
lion
crouched
close
on
his
haunches
there
awaiteth
his
leap
the
fierce
thunder
growling
low
with
impatience
spite
of
winter
thou
thy
green
glory
lusty
father
of
titans
past
number
the
alone
make
thee
hoary
nestling
close
to
thy
branches
in
slumber
and
thee
mantling
with
silence
thou
alone
the
splendor
of
winter
mid
thy
hushed
precipices
hearing
crags
of
green
ice
groan
and
splinter
and
then
plunge
down
the
muffled
abysses
in
the
quiet
of
midnight
thou
alone
the
glory
of
summer
gazing
down
on
thy
broad
seas
of
forest
on
thy
subjects
that
send
a
proud
murmur
up
to
thee
to
their
sachem
who
towerest
from
thy
bleak
throne
to
heaven
si
descendero
in
infernum
ades
o
wandering
dim
on
the
extremest
edge
of
god
bright
providence
whose
spirits
sigh
drearily
in
you
like
the
winter
sedge
that
shivers
the
dead
pool
stiff
and
dry
a
thin
sad
voice
when
the
bold
wind
roars
by
from
the
clear
north
of
duty
still
by
cracked
arch
and
broken
shaft
i
trace
that
here
was
once
a
shrine
and
holy
place
of
the
supernal
beauty
a
child
reared
of
stones
and
moss
with
wilted
flowers
for
offering
laid
across
mute
recognition
of
the
grace
how
far
are
ye
from
the
innocent
from
those
whose
hearts
are
as
a
little
lane
serene
from
wall
to
wall
with
unbroke
snows
or
in
the
summer
blithe
with
green
save
the
one
track
where
naught
more
rude
is
seen
than
the
plump
wain
at
even
bringing
home
four
months
sunshine
bound
in
sheaves
how
far
are
ye
from
those
yet
who
believes
that
ye
can
shut
out
heaven
your
souls
partake
its
influence
not
in
vain
nor
all
unconscious
as
that
silent
lane
its
drift
of
noiseless
receives
looking
within
myself
i
note
how
thin
a
plank
of
station
chance
or
prosperous
fate
doth
fence
me
from
the
clutching
waves
of
sin
in
my
own
heart
i
find
the
worst
man
mate
and
see
not
dimly
the
gate
that
opes
to
those
abysses
where
ye
grope
darkly
ye
who
never
knew
on
your
young
hearts
love
consecrating
dew
or
felt
a
mother
kisses
or
home
restraining
tendrils
round
you
curled
ah
side
by
side
with
in
this
world
the
fatal
grows
and
bitter
rue
one
band
ye
can
not
break
the
force
that
clips
and
grasps
your
circles
to
the
central
light
yours
is
the
prodigal
comet
long
ellipse
to
the
farthest
verge
of
night
yet
strives
with
you
no
less
that
inward
might
no
sin
hath
imbruted
the
god
in
you
the
eye
eludes
the
law
brooks
not
to
have
its
solitudes
by
bigot
feet
polluted
yet
they
who
watch
your
return
may
see
your
happy
perihelion
burn
where
the
calm
sun
his
unfledged
planets
broods
to
the
past
wondrous
and
awful
are
thy
silent
halls
o
kingdom
of
the
past
there
lie
the
bygone
ages
in
their
palls
guarded
by
shadows
vast
there
all
is
hushed
and
breathless
save
when
some
image
of
old
error
falls
earth
worshipped
once
as
deathless
there
sits
drear
egypt
mid
beleaguering
sands
half
woman
and
half
beast
the
torch
within
her
mouldering
hands
that
once
lit
all
the
east
a
dotard
bleared
and
hoary
there
asser
crouches
the
blackened
brands
of
asia
glory
still
as
a
city
buried
the
sea
thy
courts
and
temples
stand
idle
as
forms
on
tapestry
of
saints
and
heroes
grand
thy
phantasms
grope
and
shiver
or
watch
the
loose
shores
crumbling
silently
into
time
gnawing
river
titanic
shapes
with
faces
blank
and
dun
of
their
old
godhead
lorn
gaze
on
the
embers
of
the
sunken
sun
which
they
misdeem
for
morn
and
yet
the
eternal
sorrow
in
their
unmonarched
eyes
says
day
is
done
without
the
hope
of
morrow
o
realm
of
silence
and
of
swart
eclipse
the
shapes
that
haunt
thy
gloom
make
signs
to
us
and
move
their
withered
lips
across
the
gulf
of
doom
yet
all
their
sound
and
motion
bring
no
more
freight
to
us
than
wraiths
of
ships
on
the
mirage
ocean
and
if
sometimes
a
moaning
wandereth
from
out
thy
desolate
halls
if
some
grim
shadow
of
thy
living
death
across
our
sunshine
falls
and
scares
the
world
to
error
the
eternal
life
sends
forth
melodious
breath
to
chase
the
misty
terror
thy
mighty
clamors
wars
and
deeds
are
silent
now
in
dust
gone
like
a
tremble
of
the
huddling
reeds
beneath
some
sudden
gust
thy
forms
and
creeds
have
vanished
tossed
out
to
wither
like
unsightly
weeds
from
the
world
garden
banished
whatever
of
true
life
there
was
in
thee
leaps
in
our
age
veins
wield
still
thy
bent
and
wrinkled
empery
and
shake
thine
idle
chains
to
thee
thy
dross
is
clinging
for
us
thy
martyrs
die
thy
prophets
see
thy
poets
still
are
singing
here
mid
the
bleak
waves
of
our
strife
and
care
float
the
green
fortunate
isles
where
all
thy
dwell
and
share
our
martyrdoms
and
toils
the
present
moves
attended
with
all
of
brave
and
excellent
and
fair
that
made
the
old
time
splendid
to
the
future
o
land
of
promise
from
what
pisgah
height
can
i
behold
thy
stretch
of
peaceful
bowers
thy
golden
harvests
flowing
out
of
sight
thy
nestled
homes
and
towers
gazing
upon
the
sunset
gold
its
crags
of
opal
and
of
chrysolite
its
deeps
on
deeps
of
glory
that
unfold
still
brightening
abysses
and
blazing
precipices
whence
but
a
scanty
leap
it
seems
to
heaven
sometimes
a
glimpse
is
given
of
thy
more
gorgeous
realm
thy
more
unstinted
blisses
o
land
of
quiet
to
thy
shore
the
surf
of
the
perturbèd
present
rolls
and
sleeps
our
storms
breathe
soft
as
june
upon
thy
turf
and
lure
out
blossoms
to
thy
bosom
leaps
as
to
a
mother
the
heart
hearing
far
off
and
dim
the
toiling
mart
the
hurrying
feet
the
curses
without
number
and
circled
with
the
glow
elysian
of
thine
exulting
vision
out
of
its
very
cares
wooes
charms
for
peace
and
slumber
to
thee
the
earth
lifts
up
her
fettered
hands
and
cries
for
vengeance
with
a
pitying
smile
thou
blessest
her
and
she
forgets
her
bands
and
her
old
face
a
little
while
grows
young
and
noble
unto
thee
the
oppressor
looks
and
is
dumb
with
awe
the
eternal
law
which
makes
the
crime
its
own
blindfold
redresser
shadows
his
heart
with
perilous
foreboding
and
he
can
see
the
doom
from
out
the
trembling
gloom
its
steeds
toward
his
palace
goading
what
promises
hast
thou
for
poets
eyes
aweary
of
the
turmoil
and
the
wrong
to
all
their
hopes
what
overjoyed
replies
what
undreamed
ecstasies
for
blissful
song
thy
happy
plains
no
brawling
clangor
disturbs
and
fools
the

the

not
on

no

no

their

his

the

mid
his
toil

and

climb
about

as

thou

the

the

at

on
your

this
agony
of
hopeless
contrast
spare
me
fade
cheating

to
my

he
is
a
coward
who
would
borrow
a
charm
against
the
present
sorrow
from
the
vague
future
promise
of
delight
as
life
alarums
nearer
roll
the
ancestral
buckler
calls
from
the
walls
in
the
high
temple
of
the
soul
where
are
most
sorrows
there
the
poet
sphere
is
to
feed
the
soul
with
patience
to
heal
its
desolations
with
words
of
unshorn
truth
with
love
that
never
wearies
hebe
i
saw
the
twinkle
of
white
feet
i
saw
the
flash
of
robes
descending
before
her
ran
an
influence
fleet
that
bowed
my
heart
like
barley
bending
as
in
bare
fields
the
searching
bees
pilot
to
blooms
beyond
our
finding
it
led
me
on
by
sweet
degrees
joy
simple
unbinding
those
graces
were
that
seemed
grim
fates
with
nearer
love
the
sky
leaned
me
the
secret
golden
gates
on
musical
hinges
swung
before
me
i
saw
the
brimmed
bowl
in
her
grasp
thrilling
with
godhood
like
a
lover
i
sprang
the
proffered
life
to
clasp
the
beaker
fell
the
luck
was
over
the
earth
has
drunk
the
vintage
up
what
boots
it
patch
the
goblet
splinters
can
summer
fill
the
icy
cup
whose
treacherous
crystal
is
but
winter
o
spendthrift
haste
await
the
gods
their
nectar
crowns
the
lips
of
patience
haste
scatters
on
unthankful
sods
the
immortal
gift
in
vain
libations
coy
hebe
flies
from
those
that
woo
and
shuns
the
hands
would
seize
upon
her
follow
thy
life
and
she
will
sue
to
pour
for
thee
the
cup
of
honor
the
search
i
went
to
seek
for
christ
and
nature
seemed
so
fair
that
first
the
woods
and
fields
my
youth
enticed
and
i
was
sure
to
find
him
there
the
temple
i
forsook
and
to
the
solitude
allegiance
paid
but
winter
came
and
shook
the
crown
and
purple
from
my
wood
his
snows
like
desert
sands
with
scornful
drift
besieged
the
columned
aisle
and
my
thebes
cut
deep
with
many
a
solemn
rift
but
epitaphed
her
own
sepulchred
state
then
i
remembered
whom
i
went
to
seek
and
blessed
blunt
winter
for
his
counsel
bleak
back
to
the
world
i
turned
for
christ
i
said
is
king
so
the
cramped
alley
and
the
hut
i
spurned
as
far
beneath
his
sojourning
mid
power
and
wealth
i
sought
but
found
no
trace
of
him
and
all
the
costly
offerings
i
had
brought
with
sudden
rust
and
mould
grew
dim
i
found
his
tomb
indeed
where
by
their
laws
all
must
on
stated
days
themselves
imprison
mocking
with
bread
a
dead
creed
grinning
jaws
witless
how
long
the
life
had
thence
arisen
due
sacrifice
to
this
they
set
apart
prizing
it
more
than
christ
own
living
heart
so
from
my
feet
the
dust
of
the
proud
world
i
shook
then
came
dear
love
and
shared
with
me
his
crust
and
half
my
sorrow
burden
took
after
the
world
soft
bed
its
rich
and
dainty
fare
like
down
seemed
love
coarse
pillow
to
my
head
his
cheap
food
seemed
as
manna
rare
prints
of
bare
and
bleeding
feet
turned
to
the
heedless
city
whence
i
came
hard
by
i
saw
and
springs
of
worship
sweet
gushed
from
my
cleft
heart
smitten
by
the
same
love
looked
me
in
the
face
and
spake
no
words
but
straight
i
knew
those
were
the
lord
i
followed
where
they
led
and
in
a
hovel
rude
with
naught
to
fence
the
weather
from
his
head
the
king
i
sought
for
meekly
stood
a
naked
hungry
child
clung
round
his
gracious
knee
and
a
poor
hunted
slave
looked
up
and
smiled
to
bless
the
smile
that
set
him
free
new
miracles
i
saw
his
presence
do
no
more
i
knew
the
hovel
bare
and
poor
the
gathered
chips
into
a
woodpile
grew
the
broken
morsel
swelled
to
goodly
store
i
knelt
and
wept
my
christ
no
more
i
seek
his
throne
is
with
the
outcast
and
the
weak
the
present
crisis
when
a
deed
is
done
for
freedom
through
the
broad
earth
aching
breast
runs
a
thrill
of
joy
prophetic
trembling
on
from
east
to
west
and
the
slave
he
cowers
feels
the
soul
within
him
climb
to
the
awful
verge
of
manhood
as
the
energy
sublime
of
a
century
bursts
on
the
thorny
stem
of
time
through
the
walls
of
hut
and
palace
shoots
the
instantaneous
throe
when
the
travail
of
the
ages
wrings
earth
systems
to
and
fro
at
the
birth
of
each
new
era
with
a

nation
wildly
looks
at

standing
with

apart
and
glad

mightier
leaps
beneath

so
the
evil
triumph
sendeth
with
a
terror
and
a
chill
under
continent
to
continent
the
sense
of
coming
ill
and
the
slave
he
cowers
feels
his

with

in
hot
ebbing
earthward

be

up

upward
still
and
onward
who
would
keep
abreast
of
truth
lo
before
us
gleam
her
we
ourselves
must
pilgrims
be
launch
our
mayflower
and
steer
boldly
through
the
desperate
winter
sea
nor
attempt
the
future
portal
with
the
past
key
an
reverie
what
visionary
tints
the
year
puts
on
when
falling
leaves
falter
through
motionless
air
or
numbly
cling
and
shiver
to
be
gone
how
shimmer
the
low
flats
and
pastures
bare
as
with
her
nectar
hebe
autumn
fills
the
bowl
between
me
and
those
distant
hills
and
smiles
and
shakes
abroad
her
misty
tremulous
hair
no
more
the
landscape
holds
its
wealth
apart
making
me
poorer
in
my
poverty
but
mingles
with
my
senses
and
my
heart
my
own
projected
spirit
seems
to
me
in
her
own
reverie
the
world
to
steep
is
she
that
waves
to
sympathetic
sleep
moving
as
she
is
moved
each
field
and
hill
and
tree
how
fuse
and
mix
with
what
unfelt
degrees
clasped
by
the
faint
horizon
languid
arms
each
into
each
the
hazy
distances
the
softened
season
all
the
landscape
charms
those
hills
my
native
village
that
embay
in
waves
of
dreamier
purple
roll
away
and
floating
in
mirage
seem
all
the
glimmering
farms
far
distant
sounds
the
hidden
chickadee
close
at
my
side
far
distant
sound
the
leaves
the
fields
seem
fields
of
dream
where
memory
wanders
like
gleaning
ruth
and
as
the
sheaves
of
wheat
and
barley
wavered
in
the
eye
of
boaz
as
the
maiden
glow
went
by
so
tremble
and
seem
remote
all
things
the
sense
receives
the
cock
shrill
trump
that
tells
of
scattered
corn
passed
breezily
on
by
all
his
flapping
mates
faint
and
more
faint
from
barn
to
barn
is
borne
southward
perhaps
to
far
magellan
straits
dimly
i
catch
the
throb
of
distant
flails
silently
overhead
the
henhawk
sails
with
watchful
measuring
eye
and
for
his
quarry
waits
the
sobered
robin
now
seeks
blue
his
autumn
cheer
the
squirrel
on
the
shingly
shagbark
bough
now
saws
now
lists
with
downward
eye
and
ear
then
drops
his
nut
and
with
a
chipping
bound
whisks
to
his
winding
fastness
underground
the
clouds
like
swans
drift
down
the
streaming
atmosphere
yon
bare
knoll
the
pointed
cedar
shadows
drowse
on
the
crisp
gray
moss
the
ploughman
call
creeps
faint
as
smoke
from
black
meadows
the
single
crow
a
single
caw
lets
fall
and
all
around
me
every
bush
and
tree
says
autumn
here
and
winter
soon
will
be
who
snows
his
soft
white
sleep
and
silence
over
all
the
birch
most
shy
and
of
trees
her
poverty
as
best
she
may
retrieves
and
hints
at
her
foregone
gentilities
with
some
saved
relics
of
her
wealth
of
leaves
the
with
his
royal
purple
on
glares
red
as
blood
across
the
sinking
sun
as
one
who
proudlier
to
a
falling
fortune
cleaves
he
looks
a
sachem
in
red
blanket
wrapt
who
mid
some
council
of
the
whites
erect
and
stern
in
his
own
memories
lapt
with
distant
eye
broods
over
other
sights
sees
the
hushed
wood
the
city
flare
replace
the
wounded
turf
heal
the
railway
trace
and
roams
the
savage
past
of
his
undwindled
rights
the
yields
all
for
lost
and
with
his
crumpled
foliage
stiff
and
dry
after
the
first
betrayal
of
the
frost
rebuffs
the
kiss
of
the
relenting
sky
the
chestnuts
lavish
of
their
gold
to
the
faint
summer
beggared
now
and
old
pour
back
the
sunshine
hoarded
her
favoring
eye
the
ash
her
purple
drops
forgivingly
and
sadly
breaking
not
the
general
hush
the
glow
like
a
sunset
sea
each
leaf
a
ripple
with
its
separate
flush
all
round
the
wood
edge
creeps
the
skirting
blaze
of
bushes
low
as
when
on
cloudy
days
ere
the
rain
falls
the
cautious
farmer
burns
his
brush
yon
low
wall
which
guards
one
unkempt
zone
where
vines
and
weeds
and
intertwine
safe
from
the
plough
whose
rough
discordant
stone
is
massed
to
one
soft
gray
by
lichens
fine
the
tangled
blackberry
crossed
and
recrossed
weaves
a
prickly
network
of
ensanguined
leaves
hard
by
with
coral
beads
the
prim
shine
pillaring
with
flame
this
crumbling
boundary
whose
loose
blocks
topple
the
ploughboy
foot
who
with
each
sense
shut
fast
except
the
eye
creeps
close
and
scares
the
jay
he
hoped
to
shoot
the
woodbine
up
the
elm
straight
stem
aspires
coiling
it
harmless
with
autumnal
fires
in
the
ivy
paler
blaze
the
martyr
oak
stands
mute
below
the
charles
a
stripe
of
nether
sky
now
hid
by
rounded
between
whose
gaps
the
misplaced
sail
sweeps
bellying
by
now
flickering
golden
through
a
woodland
screen
then
spreading
out
at
his
next
turn
beyond
a
silver
circle
like
an
inland
pond
slips
seaward
silently
through
marshes
purple
and
green
dear
marshes
vain
to
him
the
gift
of
sight
who
can
not
in
their
various
incomes
share
from
every
season
drawn
of
shade
and
light
who
sees
in
them
but
levels
brown
and
bare
each
change
of
storm
or
sunshine
scatters
free
on
them
its
largesse
of
variety
for
nature
with
cheap
means
still
works
her
wonders
rare
in
spring
they
lie
one
broad
expanse
of
green
which
the
light
winds
run
with
glimmering
feet
here
yellower
stripes
track
out
the
creek
unseen
there
darker
growths
hidden
ditches
meet
and
purpler
stains
show
where
the
blossoms
crowd
as
if
the
silent
shadow
of
a
cloud
hung
there
becalmed
with
the
next
breath
to
fleet
all
round
upon
the
river
slippery
edge
witching
to
deeper
calm
the
drowsy
tide
whispers
and
leans
the
sedge
through
emerald
glooms
the
lingering
waters
slide
or
sometimes
wavering
throw
back
the
sun
and
the
stiff
banks
in
eddies
melt
and
run
of
dimpling
light
and
with
the
current
seem
to
glide
in
summer
is
a
blithesome
sight
to
see
as
step
by
step
with
measured
swing
they
pass
the
mowers
wading
to
the
knee
their
sharp
scythes
panting
through
the
grass
then
stretched
beneath
a
rick
shade
in
a
ring
their
nooning
take
while
one
begins
to
sing
a
stave
that
droops
and
dies
the
close
sky
of
brass
meanwhile
the
the
bobolink
remembering
duty
in
stops
just
ere
he
sweeps
rapture
tremulous
brink
and
the
winrows
most
demurely
drops
a
decorous
bird
of
business
who
provides
for
his
brown
mate
and
fledglings
six
besides
and
looks
from
right
to
left
a
farmer
mid
his
crops
another
change
subdues
them
in
the
fall
but
saddens
not
they
still
show
merrier
tints
though
sober
russet
seems
to
cover
all
when
the
first
sunshine
through
their
glints
look
how
the
yellow
clearness
streamed
across
redeems
with
rarer
hues
the
season
loss
as
dawn
feet
there
had
touched
and
left
their
rosy
prints
or
come
when
sunset
gives
its
freshened
zest
lean
the
bridge
and
let
the
ruddy
thrill
while
the
shorn
sun
swells
down
the
hazy
west
glow
opposite
the
marshes
drink
their
fill
and
swoon
with
purple
veins
then
slowly
fade
through
pink
to
brown
as
eastward
moves
the
shade
lengthening
with
stealthy
creep
of
simond
darkening
hill
later
and
yet
ere
winter
wholly
shuts
ere
through
the
first
dry
snow
the
runner
grates
and
the
loath
screams
in
slippery
ruts
while
firmer
ice
the
eager
boy
awaits
trying
each
buckle
and
strap
beside
the
fire
and
until
plays
with
his
desire
twenty
times
putting
on
and
off
his
skates
then
every
morn
the
river
banks
shine
bright
with
smooth
treacherous
and
frail
by
the
frost
clinking
hammers
forged
at
night
which
the
lances
of
the
sun
prevail
giving
a
pretty
emblem
of
the
day
when
guiltier
arms
in
light
shall
melt
away
and
states
shall
move
loosed
from
war
cramping
mail
and
now
those
waterfalls
the
ebbing
river
twice
every
day
creates
on
either
side
tinkle
as
through
their
grots
they
shiver
in
channels
to
the
sun
denied
high
flaps
in
sparkling
blue
the
crow
the
silvered
flats
gleam
frostily
below
suddenly
drops
the
gull
and
breaks
the
glassy
tide
but
crowned
in
turn
by
vying
seasons
three
their
winter
halo
hath
a
fuller
ring
this
glory
seems
to
rest
immovably
the
others
were
too
fleet
and
vanishing
when
the
hid
tide
is
at
its
highest
flow
marsh
and
stream
one
breathless
trance
of
snow
with
brooding
fulness
awes
and
hushes
everything
the
sunshine
seems
blown
off
by
the
bleak
wind
as
pale
as
formal
candles
lit
by
day
gropes
to
the
sea
the
river
dumb
and
blind
the
brown
ricks
by
the
storm
in
play
show
pearly
breakers
combing
their
lee
white
crests
as
of
some
just
enchanted
sea
checked
in
their
maddest
leap
and
hanging
poised
midway
but
when
the
eastern
blow
with
rain
aslant
from
prairies
green
and
rolling
plains
drives
in
his
wallowing
herds
of
billows
gaunt
and
the
roused
charles
remembers
in
his
veins
old
ocean
blood
and
snaps
his
gyves
of
frost
that
tyrannous
silence
on
the
shores
is
tost
in
dreary
wreck
and
crumbling
desolation
reigns
edgewise
or
flat
in
device
with
leaden
pools
between
or
gullies
bare
the
blocks
lie
strewn
a
bleak
stonehenge
of
ice
no
life
no
sound
to
break
the
grim
despair
save
sullen
plunge
as
through
the
sedges
stiff
down
crackles
riverward
some
cliff
or
when
the
fields
of
ice
crunch
here
and
there
but
let
me
turn
from
scenes
to
that
whose
pastoral
calm
before
me
lies
here
nothing
harsh
or
rugged
intervenes
the
early
evening
with
her
misty
dyes
smooths
off
the
ravelled
edges
of
the
nigh
relieves
the
distant
with
her
cooler
sky
and
tones
the
landscape
down
and
soothes
the
wearied
eyes
there
gleams
my
native
village
dear
to
me
though
higher
change
waves
each
day
are
seen
whelming
fields
famed
in
boyhood
history
sanding
with
houses
the
diminished
green
there
in
red
brick
which
softening
time
defies
stand
square
and
stiff
the
muses
factories
how
with
my
life
knit
up
is
every
scene
flow
on
dear
river
not
alone
you
flow
to
outward
sight
and
through
your
marshes
wind
fed
from
the
mystic
springs
of
your
twin
flows
silent
through
my
world
of
mind
grow
dim
dear
marshes
in
the
evening
gray
before
my
inner
sight
ye
stretch
away
and
will
forever
though
these
fleshly
eyes
grow
blind
beyond
that
hillock
swell
where
gothic
chapels
house
the
horse
and
chaise
where
quiet
cits
in
grecian
temples
dwell
where
coptic
tombs
resound
with
prayer
and
praise
where
dust
and
mud
the
equal
year
divide
there
gentle
allston
lived
and
wrought
and
died
transfiguring
street
and
shop
with
his
illumined
gaze
vidi
i
have
seen
but
as
a
boy
who
looks
alike
on
all
that
misty
hair
that
fine
mien
tremulous
as
down
to
feeling
faintest
call
ah
dear
old
homestead
count
it
to
thy
fame
that
thither
many
times
the
painter
came
one
elm
yet
bears
his
name
a
feathery
tree
and
tall
swiftly
the
present
fades
in
memory
glow
our
only
sure
possession
is
the
past
the
village
blacksmith
died
a
month
ago
and
dim
to
me
the
forge
roaring
blast
soon
mediævals
we
shall
see
oust
the
black
smithy
from
its
chestnut
tree
and
that
hewn
down
perhaps
the
beehive
green
and
vast
how
many
times
prouder
than
king
on
throne
loosed
from
the
village
a
and
b
panting
have
i
the
creaky
bellows
blown
and
watched
the
pent
volcano
red
increase
then
paused
to
see
the
ponderous
sledge
brought
down
by
that
hard
arm
voluminous
and
brown
from
the
white
iron
swarm
its
golden
vanishing
bees
dear
native
town
whose
choking
elms
each
year
with
eddying
dust
before
their
time
turn
gray
pining
for
rain
to
me
thy
dust
is
dear
it
glorifies
the
eve
of
summer
day
and
when
the
westering
sun
burns
the
air
to
deepest
orange
turns
the
westward
horseman
rides
through
clouds
of
gold
away
so
palpable
i
seen
those
unshorn
few
the
six
old
willows
at
the
causey
end
such
trees
paul
potter
never
dreamed
nor
drew
through
this
dry
mist
their
checkering
shadows
send
striped
here
and
there
with
many
a
thread
where
streamed
through
leafy
chinks
the
trembling
red
past
which
in
one
bright
trail
the
hangbird
flashes
blend
yes
dearer
far
thy
dust
than
all
that
beneath
the
awarded
crown
of
victory
gilded
the
blown
olympic
charioteer
though
lightly
prized
the
ribboned
parchments
three
yet
i
am
glad
that
here
what
colleging
was
mine
i
had
it
linked
another
tie
dear
native
town
with
thee
nearer
art
thou
than
simply
native
earth
my
dust
with
thine
concedes
a
deeper
tie
a
closer
claim
thy
soil
may
well
put
forth
something
of
kindred
more
than
sympathy
for
in
thy
bounds
i
reverently
laid
away
that
blinding
anguish
of
forsaken
clay
that
title
i
seemed
to
have
in
earth
and
sea
and
sky
that
portion
of
my
life
more
choice
to
me
though
brief
yet
in
itself
so
round
and
whole
than
all
the
imperfect
residue
can
be
the
artist
saw
his
statue
of
the
soul
was
perfect
so
with
one
regretful
stroke
the
earthen
model
into
fragments
broke
and
without
her
the
impoverished
seasons
roll
the
growth
of
the
legend
a
fragment
a
legend
that
grew
in
the
forest
hush
slowly
as
gather
and
gush
when
a
word
some
poet
chanced
to
say
ages
ago
in
his
careless
way
brings
our
youth
back
to
us
out
of
its
shroud
clearly
as
under
yon
i
see
that
white
it
grew
and
grew
from
the
gathering
a
sombre
hue
till
it
seems
a
mere
murmur
out
of
the
vast
norwegian
forests
of
the
past
and
it
grew
itself
like
a
true
northern
pine
first
a
little
slender
line
like
a
mermaid
green
eyelash
and
then
anon
a
stem
that
a
tower
might
rest
upon
standing
in
the
moss
its
bony
roots
clutching
around
and
across
as
if
they
would
tear
up
earth
heart
in
their
grasp
ere
the
storm
should
uproot
them
or
make
them
unclasp
its
cloudy
boughs
singing
as
suiteth
the
pine
to
shrunk
old
songs
of
the
brine
till
they
straightened
and
let
their
staves
fall
to
the
floor
hearing
waves
moan
again
on
the
perilous
shore
of
vinland
perhaps
while
their
prow
groped
its
way
the
frothy
gnashed
tusks
of
some
bay
so
the
legend
grew
and
tall
as
the
gipsy
child
grows
that
eats
crusts
in
the
hall
it
sucked
the
whole
strength
of
the
earth
and
the
sky
spring
summer
fall
winter
all
brought
it
supply
was
a
natural
growth
and
stood
fearlessly
there
a
true
part
of
the
landscape
as
sea
land
and
air
for
it
grew
in
good
times
ere
the
fashion
it
was
to
force
up
these
wild
births
of
the
woods
under
glass
and
so
if
is
told
as
it
should
be
told
though
were
sung
under
venice
moonlight
of
gold
you
would
hear
the
old
voice
of
its
mother
the
pine
murmur
and
northern
through
every
line
and
the
verses
should
hang
and
free
round
the
vibrating
stem
of
the
melody
like
the
lithe
limbs
of
the
parent
tree
yes
the
pine
is
the
mother
of
legends
what
food
for
their
grim
roots
is
left
when
the
wood
the
cathedral
whose
tall
arches
spring
light
sinewy
graceful
as
the
wing
from
michael
white
shoulder
is
hewn
and
defaced
by
iconoclast
axes
in
desperate
waste
and
its
wrecks
seek
the
ocean
it
prophesied
long
crooning
its
mystical
song
then
the
legends
go
with
them
even
yet
on
the
sea
a
wild
virtue
is
left
in
the
touch
of
the
tree
and
the
sailor
are
thrilled
to
the
core
with
the
lineal
offspring
of
odin
and
thor
yes
wherever
the
has
never
let
in
since
the
day
of
creation
the
light
and
the
din
of
manifold
life
but
has
safely
conveyed
from
the
midnight
primeval
its
armful
of
shade
and
has
kept
the
weird
past
with
its
sagas
alive
mid
the
hum
and
the
stir
of
busy
hive
there
the
legend
takes
root
in
the
gloom
and
its
murmurous
boughs
for
their
tossing
find
room
where
aroostook
seems
to
sob
as
he
goes
groping
down
to
the
sea
his
mountainous
snows
where
the
lake
frore
sahara
of
white
when
the
crack
shoots
across
it
complains
to
the
night
with
a
long
lonely
moan
that
leagues
northward
is
lost
as
the
ice
shrinks
away
from
the
tread
of
the
frost
where
the
lumberers
sit
by
the
which
throw
their
own
threatening
shadows
far
round
the
snow
when
the
wolf
howls
aloof
and
the
wavering
glare
flashes
out
from
the
blackness
the
eyes
of
the
bear
when
the
wood
huge
recesses
supply
a
canvas
where
fancy
her
mad
brush
may
try
blotting
in
giant
horrors
that
venture
not
down
through
the
streets
of
the
brisk
whitewashed
town
but
skulk
in
the
depths
of
the
measureless
wood
mid
the
dark
creeping
whispers
that
curdle
the
blood
when
the
eye
glanced
in
dread
the
shoulder
may
dream
ere
it
shrinks
to
the
companioning
gleam
that
it
saw
the
fierce
ghost
of
the
red
man
crouch
back
to
the
shroud
of
the
invincible
black
there
the
old
shapes
crowd
thick
round
the
camp
which
shun
the
keen
gleam
of
the
scholarly
lamp
and
the
seed
of
the
legend
finds
true
norland
ground
while
the
told
and
the
canteen
flits
round
a
contrast
thy
love
thou
sentest
oft
to
me
and
still
as
oft
i
thrust
it
back
thy
messengers
i
could
not
see
in
those
who
everything
did
lack
the
poor
the
outcast
and
the
black
pride
held
his
hand
before
mine
eyes
the
world
with
flattery
stuffed
mine
ears
i
looked
to
see
a
monarch
guise
nor
dreamed
thy
love
would
knock
for
years
poor
naked
fettered
full
of
tears
yet
when
i
sent
my
love
to
thee
thou
with
a
smile
didst
take
it
in
and
it
royally
though
grimed
with
earth
with
hunger
thin
and
leprous
with
the
taint
of
sin
now
every
day
thy
love
i
meet
as
the
earth
it
wanders
wide
with
weary
step
and
bleeding
feet
still
knocking
at
the
heart
of
pride
and
offering
grace
though
still
denied
extreme
unction
go
leave
me
priest
my
soul
would
be
alone
with
the
consoler
death
far
sadder
eyes
than
thine
will
see
this
crumbling
clay
yield
up
its
breath
these
shrivelled
hands
have
deeper
stains
than
holy
oil
can
cleanse
away
hands
that
have
plucked
the
world
coarse
gains
as
erst
they
plucked
the
flowers
of
may
call
if
thou
canst
to
these
gray
eyes
some
faith
from
youth
traditions
wrung
this
fruitless
husk
which
dustward
dries
has
been
a
heart
once
has
been
young
on
this
bowed
head
the
awful
past
once
laid
its
consecrating
hands
the
future
in
its
purpose
vast
paused
waiting
my
supreme
commands
but
look
whose
shadows
block
the
door
who
are
those
two
that
stand
aloof
see
on
my
hands
this
freshening
gore
writes
again
its
crimson
proof
my
guests
are
met
there
my
dead
youth
doth
wring
its
hands
and
there
with
eyes
that
goad
me
yet
the
ghost
of
my
ideal
stands
god
bends
from
out
the
deep
and
says
i
gave
thee
the
great
gift
of
life
wast
thou
not
called
in
many
ways
are
not
my
earth
and
heaven
at
strife
i
gave
thee
of
my
seed
to
sow
bringest
thou
me
my
can
i
look
up
with
face
aglow
and
answer
father
here
is
gold
i
have
been
innocent
god
knows
when
first
this
wasted
life
began
not
grape
with
grape
more
kindly
grows
than
i
with
every
now
here
i
gasp
what
lose
my
kind
when
this
breath
shall
part
what
bands
of
love
and
service
bind
this
being
to
the
world
sad
heart
christ
still
was
wandering
the
earth
without
a
place
to
lay
his
head
he
found
free
welcome
at
my
hearth
he
shared
my
cup
and
broke
my
bread
now
when
i
hear
those
steps
sublime
that
bring
the
other
world
to
this
my
nature
sunk
in
slime
starts
sideway
with
defiant
hiss
upon
the
hour
when
i
was
born
god
said
another
man
shall
be
and
the
great
maker
did
not
scorn
out
of
himself
to
fashion
me
he
sunned
me
with
his
ripening
looks
and
heaven
rich
instincts
in
me
grew
as
effortless
as
woodland
nooks
send
violets
up
and
paint
them
blue
yes
i
who
now
with
angry
tears
am
exiled
back
to
brutish
clod
have
borne
unquenched
for
fourscore
years
a
spark
of
the
eternal
god
and
to
what
end
how
yield
i
back
the
trust
for
such
high
uses
given
heaven
light
hath
but
revealed
a
track
whereby
to
crawl
away
from
heaven
men
think
it
is
an
awful
sight
to
see
a
soul
just
set
adrift
on
that
drear
voyage
from
whose
night
the
ominous
shadows
never
lift
but
is
more
awful
to
behold
a
helpless
infant
newly
born
whose
little
hands
unconscious
hold
the
keys
of
darkness
and
of
morn
mine
held
them
once
i
flung
away
those
keys
that
might
have
open
set
the
golden
sluices
of
the
day
but
clutch
the
keys
of
darkness
yet
i
hear
the
reapers
singing
go
into
god
harvest
i
that
might
with
them
have
chosen
here
below
grope
shuddering
at
the
gates
of
night
o
glorious
youth
that
once
wast
mine
o
high
ideal
all
in
vain
ye
enter
at
this
ruined
shrine
whence
worship
shall
rise
again
the
bat
and
owl
inhabit
here
the
snake
nests
in
the
the
sacred
vessels
moulder
near
the
image
of
the
god
is
gone
the
oak
what
gnarlèd
stretch
what
depth
of
shade
is
his
there
needs
no
crown
to
mark
the
forest
king
how
in
his
leaves
outshines
full
summer
bliss
sun
storm
rain
dew
to
him
their
tribute
bring
which
he
with
such
benignant
royalty
accepts
as
overpayeth
what
is
lent
all
nature
seems
his
vassal
proud
to
be
and
cunning
only
for
his
ornament
how
towers
he
too
amid
the
billowed
snows
an
unquelled
exile
from
the
summer
throne
whose
plain
uncinctured
front
more
kingly
shows
now
that
the
obscuring
courtier
leaves
are
flown
his
boughs
make
music
of
the
winter
air
jewelled
with
sleet
like
some
cathedral
front
where
clinging
with
quaint
art
repair
the
dints
and
furrows
of
time
envious
brunt
how
doth
his
patient
strength
the
rude
march
wind
persuade
to
seem
glad
breaths
of
summer
breeze
and
win
the
soil
that
fain
would
be
unkind
to
swell
his
revenues
with
proud
increase
he
is
the
gem
and
all
the
landscape
wide
so
doth
his
grandeur
isolate
the
sense
seems
but
the
setting
worthless
all
beside
an
empty
socket
were
he
fallen
thence
so
from
off
converse
with
life
wintry
gales
should
man
learn
how
to
clasp
with
tougher
roots
the
inspiring
earth
how
otherwise
avails
the
sap
that
sunward
shoots
so
every
year
that
falls
with
noiseless
flake
should
fill
old
scars
upon
the
stormward
side
and
make
hoar
age
revered
for
age
sake
not
for
traditions
of
youth
leafy
pride
so
from
the
pinched
soil
of
a
churlish
fate
true
hearts
compel
the
sap
of
sturdier
growth
so
between
earth
and
heaven
stand
simply
great
that
these
shall
seem
but
their
attendants
both
for
nature
forces
with
obedient
zeal
wait
on
the
rooted
faith
and
oaken
will
as
quickly
the
pretender
cheat
they
feel
and
turn
mad
pucks
to
flout
and
mock
him
still
lord
all
thy
works
are
lessons
each
contains
some
emblem
of
man
soul
shall
he
make
fruitless
all
thy
glorious
pains
delving
within
thy
grace
an
eyeless
mole
make
me
the
least
of
thy
cause
me
some
message
of
thy
truth
to
bring
speak
but
a
word
through
me
nor
let
thy
love
among
my
boughs
disdain
to
perch
and
sing
ambrose
never
surely
was
holier
man
than
ambrose
since
the
world
began
with
diet
spare
and
raiment
thin
he
shielded
himself
from
the
father
of
sin
with
bed
of
iron
and
scourgings
oft
his
heart
to
god
hand
as
wax
made
soft
through
earnest
prayer
and
watchings
long
he
sought
to
know
right
and
wrong
much
wrestling
with
the
blessed
word
to
make
it
yield
the
sense
of
the
lord
that
he
might
build
a
creed
to
fold
the
flock
in
at
their
need
at
last
he
builded
a
perfect
faith
fenced
round
about
with
lord
thus
to
himself
he
fitted
the
doorway
size
meted
the
light
to
the
need
of
his
eyes
and
knew
by
a
sure
and
inward
sign
that
the
work
of
his
fingers
was
divine
then
ambrose
said
all
those
shall
die
the
eternal
death
who
believe
not
as
i
and
some
were
boiled
some
burned
in
fire
some
sawn
in
twain
that
his
heart
desire
for
the
good
of
men
souls
might
be
satisfied
by
the
drawing
of
all
to
the
righteous
side
one
day
as
ambrose
was
seeking
the
truth
in
his
lonely
walk
he
saw
a
youth
resting
himself
in
the
shade
of
a
tree
it
had
never
been
given
him
to
see
so
shining
a
face
and
the
good
man
thought
were
pity
he
should
not
believe
as
he
ought
so
he
set
himself
by
the
young
man
side
and
the
state
of
his
soul
with
questions
tried
but
the
heart
of
the
stranger
was
hardened
indeed
nor
received
the
stamp
of
the
one
true
creed
and
the
spirit
of
ambrose
waxed
sore
to
find
such
face
the
porch
of
so
narrow
a
mind
as
each
beholds
in
cloud
and
fire
the
shape
that
answers
his
own
desire
so
each
said
the
youth
in
the
law
shall
find
the
figure
and
features
of
his
mind
and
to
each
in
his
mercy
hath
god
allowed
his
several
pillar
of
fire
and
cloud
the
soul
of
ambrose
burned
with
zeal
and
holy
wrath
for
the
young
man
weal
believest
thou
then
most
wretched
youth
cried
he
a
dividual
essence
in
truth
i
fear
me
thy
heart
is
too
cramped
with
sin
to
take
the
lord
in
his
glory
in
now
there
bubbled
beside
them
where
they
stood
a
fountain
of
waters
sweet
and
good
the
youth
to
the
streamlet
brink
drew
near
saying
ambrose
thou
maker
of
creeds
look
here
six
vases
of
crystal
then
he
took
and
set
them
along
the
edge
of
the
brook
as
into
these
vessels
the
water
i
pour
there
shall
one
hold
less
another
more
and
the
water
unchanged
in
every
case
shall
put
on
the
figure
of
the
vase
o
thou
who
wouldst
unity
make
through
strife
canst
thou
fit
this
sign
to
the
water
of
life
when
ambrose
looked
up
he
stood
alone
the
youth
and
the
stream
and
the
vases
were
gone
but
he
knew
by
a
sense
of
humbled
grace
he
had
talked
with
an
angel
face
to
face
and
felt
his
heart
change
inwardly
as
he
fell
on
his
knees
beneath
the
tree
above
and
below
o
dwellers
in
the
who
in
deep
twilight
grope
and
cower
till
the
slow
mountain
shortens
to
noon
triumphal
hour
while
ye
sit
idle
do
ye
think
the
lord
great
work
sits
idle
too
that
light
dare
not
the
brink
of
morn
because
is
dark
with
you
though
yet
your
valleys
skulk
in
night
in
god
ripe
fields
the
day
is
cried
and
reapers
with
their
sickles
bright
troop
singing
down
the
mountain
side
come
up
and
feel
what
health
there
is
in
the
frank
dawn
delighted
eyes
as
bending
with
a
pitying
kiss
the
tears
of
earth
she
dries
the
lord
wants
reapers
o
mount
up
before
night
comes
and
says
too
late
stay
not
for
taking
scrip
or
cup
the
master
hungers
while
ye
wait
is
from
these
heights
alone
your
eyes
the
advancing
spears
of
day
can
see
which
the
eastern
rise
to
break
your
long
captivity
ii
lone
watcher
on
the
it
is
right
precious
to
behold
the
first
long
surf
of
climbing
light
flood
all
the
thirsty
east
with
gold
but
we
who
in
the
shadow
sit
know
also
when
the
day
is
nigh
seeing
thy
shining
forehead
lit
with
his
inspiring
prophecy
thou
hast
thine
office
we
have
ours
god
lacks
not
early
service
here
but
what
are
thine
eleventh
hours
he
counts
with
us
for
morning
cheer
our
day
for
him
is
long
enough
and
when
he
giveth
work
to
do
the
bruisèd
reed
is
amply
tough
to
pierce
the
shield
of
error
through
but
not
the
less
do
thou
aspire
light
earlier
messages
to
preach
keep
back
no
syllable
of
fire
plunge
deep
the
rowels
of
thy
speech
yet
god
deems
not
thine
aëried
sight
more
worthy
than
our
twilight
dim
for
meek
obedience
too
is
light
and
following
that
is
finding
him
the
captive
it
was
past
the
hour
of
trysting
but
she
lingered
for
him
still
like
a
child
the
eager
streamlet
leaped
and
laughed
adown
the
hill
happy
to
be
free
at
twilight
from
its
toiling
at
the
mill
then
the
great
moon
on
a
sudden
ominous
and
red
as
blood
startling
as
a
new
creation
the
eastern
stood
casting
deep
and
deeper
shadows
through
the
mystery
of
the
wood
dread
closed
huge
and
vague
about
her
and
her
thoughts
turned
fearfully
to
her
heart
if
there
some
shelter
from
the
silence
there
might
be
like
bare
cedars
leaning
inland
from
the
blighting
of
the
sea
yet
he
came
not
and
the
stillness
dampened
round
her
like
a
tomb
she
could
feel
cold
eyes
of
spirits
looking
on
her
through
the
gloom
she
could
hear
the
groping
footsteps
of
some
blind
gigantic
doom
suddenly
the
silence
wavered
like
a
light
mist
in
the
wind
for
a
voice
broke
gently
through
it
felt
like
sunshine
by
the
blind
and
the
dread
like
mist
in
sunshine
furled
serenely
from
her
mind
once
my
love
my
love
forever
flesh
or
spirit
still
the
same
if
i
missed
the
hour
of
trysting
do
not
think
my
faith
to
blame
i
alas
was
made
a
captive
as
from
holy
land
i
came
on
a
green
spot
in
the
desert
gleaming
like
an
emerald
star
where
a
in
lone
silence
yearning
for
its
mate
afar
droops
above
a
silver
runnel
slender
as
a
scimitar
there
find
the
humble
postern
to
the
castle
of
my
foe
if
thy
love
burn
clear
and
faithful
strike
the
gateway
green
and
low
ask
to
enter
and
the
warder
surely
will
not
say
thee
no
slept
again
the
aspen
silence
but
her
loneliness
was
round
her
heart
a
motherly
patience
wrapt
its
arms
for
evermore
from
her
soul
ebbed
back
the
sorrow
leaving
smooth
the
golden
shore
donned
she
now
the
pilgrim
scallop
took
the
pilgrim
staff
in
hand
like
a
flitting
eastward
wandered
she
sea
and
land
and
her
footsteps
in
the
desert
fell
like
cool
rain
on
the
sand
soon
beneath
the
shadow
knelt
she
at
the
postern
low
and
thereat
she
knocketh
gently
fearing
much
the
warder
no
all
her
heart
stood
still
and
listened
as
the
door
swung
backward
slow
there
she
saw
no
surly
warder
with
an
eye
like
bolt
and
bar
through
her
soul
a
sense
of
music
throbbed
and
like
a
guardian
lar
on
the
threshold
stood
an
angel
bright
and
silent
as
a
star
fairest
seemed
he
of
god
seraphs
and
her
spirit
blossomed
when
he
turned
upon
her
the
deep
welcome
of
his
eyes
sending
upward
to
that
sunlight
all
its
dew
for
sacrifice
then
she
heard
a
voice
come
onward
singing
with
a
rapture
new
as
eve
heard
the
songs
in
eden
dropping
earthward
with
the
dew
well
she
knew
the
happy
singer
well
the
happy
song
she
knew
forward
leaped
she
the
threshold
eager
as
a
glancing
surf
fell
from
her
the
spirit
languor
fell
from
her
the
body
scurf
the
palm
next
day
some
arabs
found
a
corpse
upon
the
turf
the
rippling
through
thy
branches
goes
the
sunshine
among
thy
leaves
that
palpitate
forever
ovid
in
thee
a
pining
nymph
had
prisoned
the
soul
once
of
some
tremulous
inland
river
quivering
to
tell
her
woe
but
ah
dumb
dumb
forever
while
all
the
forest
witched
with
slumberous
moonshine
holds
up
its
leaves
in
happy
happy
silence
waiting
the
dew
with
breath
and
pulse
suspended
i
hear
afar
thy
whispering
gleamy
islands
and
track
thee
wakeful
still
amid
the
silence
upon
the
brink
of
some
lakelet
thy
foliage
like
the
tresses
of
a
dryad
dripping
about
thy
slim
white
stem
whose
shadow
slopes
quivering
down
the
water
dusky
quiet
thou
as
on
her
bath
edge
would
some
startled
dryad
thou
art
the
of
rustic
lovers
thy
white
bark
has
their
secrets
in
its
keeping
reuben
writes
here
the
happy
name
of
patience
and
thy
lithe
boughs
hang
murmuring
and
weeping
above
her
as
she
steals
the
mystery
from
thy
keeping
thou
art
to
me
like
my
beloved
maiden
so
frankly
coy
so
full
of
trembly
confidences
thy
shadow
scarce
seems
shade
thy
pattering
leaflets
sprinkle
their
gathered
sunshine
my
senses
and
nature
gives
me
all
her
summer
confidences
whether
my
heart
with
hope
or
sorrow
tremble
thou
sympathizest
still
wild
and
unquiet
i
fling
me
down
thy
ripple
like
a
river
flows
valleyward
where
calmness
is
and
by
it
my
heart
is
floated
down
into
the
land
of
quiet
an
interview
with
miles
standish
i
sat
one
evening
in
my
room
in
that
sweet
hour
of
twilight
when
blended
thoughts
half
light
half
gloom
throng
through
the
spirit
skylight
the
flames
by
fits
curled
round
the
bars
or
up
the
chimney
crinkled
while
embers
dropped
like
falling
stars
and
in
the
ashes
tinkled
i
sat
and
mused
the
fire
burned
low
and
my
senses
stealing
crept
something
of
the
ruddy
glow
that
bloomed
on
wall
and
ceiling
my
pictures
they
are
very
few
the
heads
of
ancient
wise
men
smoothed
down
their
knotted
fronts
and
grew
as
rosy
as
excisemen
my
antique
spanish
chair
felt
thrills
through
wood
and
leather
that
had
been
strangers
since
whilere
mid
andalusian
heather
the
oak
that
made
its
sturdy
frame
his
happy
arms
stretched
over
the
ox
whose
fortunate
hide
became
the
bottom
polished
cover
it
came
out
in
that
famous
bark
that
brought
our
sires
intrepid
capacious
as
another
ark
for
furniture
decrepit
for
as
that
saved
of
bird
and
beast
a
pair
for
propagation
so
has
the
seed
of
these
increased
and
furnished
half
the
nation
kings
sit
they
say
in
slippery
seats
but
those
slant
precipices
of
ice
the
northern
voyager
meets
less
slippery
are
than
this
is
to
cling
therein
would
pass
the
wit
of
royal
man
or
woman
and
can
stay
in
it
is
more
or
less
than
human
i
offer
to
all
bores
this
perch
dear
people
with
heads
as
void
as
church
tongues
longer
than
the
steeple
to
folks
with
missions
whose
gaunt
eyes
see
golden
ages
rising
salt
of
the
earth
in
what
queer
guys
fond
of
crystallizing
my
wonder
then
was
not
unmixed
with
merciful
suggestion
when
as
my
roving
eyes
grew
fixed
upon
the
chair
in
question
i
saw
its
trembling
arms
enclose
a
figure
grim
and
rusty
whose
doublet
plain
and
plainer
hose
were
something
worn
and
dusty
now
even
such
men
as
nature
forms
merely
to
fill
the
street
with
once
turned
to
ghosts
by
hungry
worms
are
serious
things
to
meet
with
your
penitent
spirits
are
no
jokes
and
though
i
not
averse
to
a
quiet
shade
even
they
are
folks
one
cares
not
to
speak
first
to
who
knows
thought
i
but
he
has
come
by
charon
kindly
ferried
to
tell
me
of
a
mighty
sum
behind
my
wainscot
buried
there
is
a
buccaneerish
air
about
that
garb
outlandish
just
then
the
ghost
drew
up
his
chair
and
said
my
name
is
standish
i
come
from
plymouth
deadly
bored
with
toasts
and
songs
and
speeches
as
long
and
flat
as
my
old
sword
as
threadbare
as
my
breeches
understand
us
pilgrims
they
smooth
men
with
rosy
faces
strength
knots
and
gnarls
all
pared
away
and
varnish
in
their
places
we
had
some
toughness
in
our
grain
the
eye
to
rightly
see
us
is
not
just
the
one
that
lights
the
brain
of
tyrtæuses
talk
about
their
pilgrim
blood
their
birthright
high
and
holy
a
that
ends
in
mud
methinks
is
melancholy
he
had
stiff
knees
the
puritan
that
were
not
good
at
bending
the
homespun
dignity
of
man
he
thought
was
worth
defending
he
did
not
with
his
pinchbeck
ore
his
country
shame
forgotten
gild
freedom
coffin
and
when
all
within
was
rotten
these
loud
ancestral
boasts
of
yours
how
can
they
else
than
vex
us
where
were
your
dinner
orators
when
slavery
grasped
at
texas
dumb
on
his
knees
was
every
one
that
now
is
bold
as
cæsar
mere
pegs
to
hang
an
office
on
such
stalwart
men
as
these
are
good
sir
i
said
you
seem
much
stirred
the
sacred
compromises
now
god
confound
the
dastard
word
my
gall
thereat
arises
northward
it
hath
this
sense
alone
that
you
your
conscience
blinding
shall
bow
your
fool
nose
to
the
stone
when
slavery
feels
like
grinding
is
shame
to
see
such
painted
sticks
in
vane
and
winthrop
places
to
see
your
spirit
of
drag
humbly
in
the
traces
with
slavery
lash
upon
her
back
and
herds
of
to
shout
applause
as
with
a
crack
it
peels
her
patient
shoulders
forefathers
to
such
a
rout
no
by
my
faith
in
god
word
half
rose
the
ghost
and
half
drew
out
the
ghost
of
his
old
broadsword
then
thrust
it
slowly
back
again
and
said
with
reverent
gesture
no
freedom
no
blood
should
not
stain
the
hem
of
thy
white
vesture
i
feel
the
soul
in
me
draw
near
the
mount
of
prophesying
in
this
bleak
wilderness
i
hear
a
john
the
baptist
crying
far
in
the
east
i
see
upleap
the
streaks
of
first
forewarning
and
they
who
sowed
the
light
shall
reap
the
golden
sheaves
of
morning
child
of
our
travail
and
our
woe
light
in
our
day
of
sorrow
through
my
rapt
spirit
i
foreknow
the
glory
of
thy
morrow
i
hear
great
steps
that
through
the
shade
draw
nigher
still
and
nigher
and
voices
call
like
that
which
bade
the
prophet
come
up
higher
i
looked
no
form
mine
eyes
could
find
i
heard
the
red
cock
crowing
and
through
my
the
wind
a
dismal
tune
was
blowing
thought
i
my
neighbor
buckingham
hath
somewhat
in
him
gritty
some
that
hates
all
sham
and
he
will
print
my
ditty
on
the
capture
of
certain
fugitive
slaves
near
washington
look
on
who
will
in
apathy
and
stifle
they
who
can
the
sympathies
the
hopes
the
words
that
make
man
truly
man
let
those
whose
hearts
are
dungeoned
up
with
interest
or
with
ease
consent
to
hear
with
quiet
pulse
of
loathsome
deeds
like
these
i
first
drew
in
new
england
air
and
from
her
hardy
breast
sucked
in
the
milk
that
will
not
let
me
rest
and
if
my
words
seem
treason
to
the
dullard
and
the
tame
is
but
my
dialect
our
fathers
spake
the
same
shame
on
the
costly
mockery
of
piling
stone
on
stone
to
those
who
won
our
liberty
the
heroes
dead
and
gone
while
we
look
coldly
on
and
see
ruffians
slay
the
men
who
fain
would
win
their
own
the
heroes
of
are
we
pledged
to
craven
silence
o
fling
it
to
the
wind
the
parchment
wall
that
bars
us
from
the
least
of
human
kind
that
makes
us
cringe
and
temporize
and
dumbly
stand
at
rest
while
pity
burning
flood
of
words
is
in
the
breast
though
we
break
our
fathers
promise
we
have
nobler
duties
first
the
traitor
to
humanity
is
the
traitor
most
accursed
man
is
more
than
constitutions
better
rot
beneath
the
sod
than
be
true
to
church
and
state
while
we
are
doubly
false
to
god
we
owe
allegiance
to
the
state
but
deeper
truer
more
to
the
sympathies
that
god
hath
set
within
our
spirit
core
our
country
claims
our
fealty
we
grant
it
so
but
then
before
man
made
us
citizens
great
nature
made
us
men
he
true
to
god
who
true
to
man
wherever
wrong
is
done
to
the
humblest
and
the
weakest
neath
the
sun
that
wrong
is
also
done
to
us
and
they
are
slaves
most
base
whose
love
of
right
is
for
themselves
and
not
for
all
their
race
god
works
for
all
ye
can
not
hem
the
hope
of
being
free
with
parallels
of

golden
padlocks
on

callous
as
ye
will
from
soul
to
soul
all
the
world
leaps
one
electric
thrill
chain
down
your
slaves
with
ignorance
ye
can
not
keep
apart
with
all
your
craft
of
tyranny
the
human
heart
from
heart
when
first
the
pilgrims
landed
on
the
iron
shore
the
word
went
forth
that
slavery
should
one
day
be
no
more
out
from
the
land
of
bondage
is
decreed
our
slaves
shall
go
and
signs
to
us
are
offered
as
erst
to
pharaoh
if
we
are
blind
their
exodus
like
israel
of
yore
through
a
red
sea
is
doomed
to
be
whose
surges
are
of
gore
is
ours
to
save
our
brethren
with
peace
and
love
to
win
their
darkened
hearts
from
error
ere
they
harden
it
to
sin
but
if
before
his
duty
man
with
listless
spirit
stands
ere
long
the
great
avenger
takes
the
work
from
out
his
hands
to
the
dandelion
dear
common
flower
that
beside
the
way
fringing
the
dusty
road
with
harmless
gold
first
pledge
of
blithesome
may
which
children
pluck
and
full
of
pride
uphold
buccaneers
that
they
an
eldorado
in
the
grass
have
found
which
not
the
rich
earth
ample
round
may
match
in
wealth
thou
art
more
dear
to
me
than
all
the
prouder
may
be
gold
such
as
thine
drew
the
spanish
prow
through
the
primeval
hush
of
indian
seas
nor
wrinkled
the
lean
brow
of
age
to
rob
the
lover
heart
of
ease
is
the
spring
largess
which
she
scatters
now
to
rich
and
poor
alike
with
lavish
hand
though
most
hearts
never
understand
to
take
it
at
god
value
but
pass
by
the
offered
wealth
with
unrewarded
eye
thou
art
my
tropics
and
mine
italy
to
look
at
thee
unlocks
a
warmer
clime
the
eyes
thou
givest
me
are
in
the
heart
and
heed
not
space
or
time
not
in
mid
june
the
bee
feels
a
more
warm
ravishment
in
the
white
lily
breezy
tent
his
fragrant
sybaris
than
i
when
first
from
the
dark
green
thy
yellow
circles
burst
then
think
i
of
deep
shadows
on
the
grass
of
meadows
where
in
sun
the
cattle
graze
where
as
the
breezes
pass
the
gleaming
rushes
lean
a
thousand
ways
of
leaves
that
slumber
in
a
cloudy
mass
or
whiten
in
the
wind
of
waters
blue
that
from
the
distance
sparkle
through
some
woodland
gap
and
of
a
sky
above
where
one
white
cloud
like
a
stray
lamb
doth
move
my
childhood
earliest
thoughts
are
linked
with
thee
the
sight
of
thee
calls
back
the
robin
song
who
from
the
dark
old
tree
beside
the
door
sang
clearly
all
day
long
and
i
secure
in
childish
piety
listened
as
if
i
heard
an
angel
sing
with
news
from
heaven
which
he
could
bring
fresh
every
day
to
my
untainted
ears
when
birds
and
flowers
and
i
were
happy
peers
how
like
a
prodigal
doth
nature
seem
when
thou
for
all
thy
gold
so
common
art
thou
teachest
me
to
deem
more
sacredly
of
every
human
heart
since
each
reflects
in
joy
its
scanty
gleam
of
heaven
and
could
some
wondrous
secret
show
did
we
but
pay
the
love
we
owe
and
with
a
child
undoubting
wisdom
look
on
all
these
living
pages
of
god
book
the
ye
who
passing
graves
by
night
glance
not
to
the
left
or
right
lest
a
spirit
should
arise
cold
and
white
to
freeze
your
eyes
some
weak
phantom
which
your
doubt
shapes
upon
the
dark
without
from
the
dark
within
a
guess
at
the
spirit
deathlessness
which
ye
entertain
with
fear
in
your
dungeon
here
where
ye
sell
your
lives
just
for
gold
to
buy
you
gyves
ye
without
a
shudder
meet
in
the
city
noonday
street
spirits
sadder
and
more
dread
than
from
out
the
clay
have
fled
buried
beyond
hope
of
light
in
the
body
haunted
night
see
ye
not
that
woman
pale
there
are
bloodhounds
on
her
trail
bloodhounds
two
all
gaunt
and
lean
for
the
soul
their
scent
is
keen
want
and
sin
and
sin
is
last
they
have
followed
far
and
fast
want
gave
tongue
and
at
her
howl
sin
awakened
with
a
growl
ah
poor
girl
she
had
a
right
to
a
blessing
from
the
light
to
sky
and
earth
god
gave
to
her
at
her
birth
but
before
they
were
enjoyed
poverty
had
made
them
void
and
had
drunk
the
sunshine
up
from
all
nature
ample
cup
leaving
her
a
share
in
the
dregs
of
darkness
there
often
on
the
sidewalk
bleak
hungry
all
alone
and
weak
she
has
seen
in
night
and
storm
rooms
with
firelight
warm
which
outside
the
doubled
all
the
cold
alas
till
each
ray
that
on
her
fell
stabbed
her
like
an
icicle
and
she
almost
loved
the
wail
of
the
bloodhounds
on
her
trail
till
the
floor
becomes
her
bier
she
shall
feel
their
pantings
near
close
upon
her
very
heels
spite
of
all
the
din
of
wheels
shivering
on
her
pallet
poor
she
shall
hear
them
at
the
door
whine
and
scratch
to
be
let
in
sister
bloodhounds
want
and
sin
hark
that
rustle
of
a
dress
stiff
with
lavish
costliness
here
comes
one
whose
cheek
would
flush
but
to
have
her
garment
brush
the
girl
whose
fingers
thin
wove
the
weary
broidery
in
bending
backward
from
her
toil
lest
her
tears
the
silk
might
soil
and
in
midnight
chill
and
murk
stitched
her
life
into
the
work
shaping
from
her
bitter
thought
and
satirizing
her
despair
with
the
emblems
woven
there
little
doth
the
wearer
heed
of
the
in
the
brede
a
hyena
by
her
side
skulks
it
is
pride
he
digs
for
her
in
the
earth
where
lie
all
her
claims
of
birth
with
his
foul
paws
rooting
some
ancestor
who
perhaps
a
statue
won
by
the
ill
deeds
he
had
done
by
the
innocent
blood
he
shed
by
the
desolation
spread
over
happy
villages
blotting
out
the
smile
of
peace
there
walks
judas
he
who
sold
yesterday
his
lord
for
gold
sold
god
presence
in
his
heart
for
a
proud
step
in
the
mart
he
hath
dealt
in
flesh
and
blood
at
the
bank
his
name
is
good
at
the
bank
and
only
there
is
a
marketable
ware
in
his
eyes
that
stealthy
gleam
was
not
learned
of
sky
or
stream
but
it
has
the
cold
hard
glint
of
new
dollars
from
the
mint
open
now
your
spirit
eyes
look
through
that
poor
clay
disguise
which
has
thickened
day
by
day
till
it
keeps
all
light
at
bay
and
his
soul
in
pitchy
gloom
gropes
about
its
narrow
tomb
from
whose
dank
and
slimy
walls
drop
by
drop
the
horror
falls
look
a
serpent
lank
and
cold
hugs
his
spirit
fold
on
fold
from
his
heart
all
day
and
night
it
doth
suck
god
blessed
light
drink
it
will
and
drink
it
must
till
the
cup
holds
naught
but
dust
all
day
long
he
hears
it
hiss
writhing
in
its
fiendish
bliss
all
night
long
he
sees
its
eyes
flicker
with
foul
ecstasies
as
the
spirit
ebbs
away
into
the
absorbing
clay
who
is
he
that
skulks
afraid
of
the
trust
he
has
betrayed
shuddering
if
perchance
a
gleam
of
old
nobleness
should
stream
through
the
pent
unwholesome
room
where
his
shrunk
soul
cowers
in
gloom
spirit
sad
beyond
the
rest
by
more
instinct
for
the
best
is
a
poet
who
was
sent
for
a
bad
world
punishment
by
compelling
it
to
see
golden
glimpses
of
to
be
by
compelling
it
to
hear
songs

with

refusing
light
hooted
from
some
hollow
tree
of
the

is
his
punishment
to
hear
flutterings

pinions

ghost

at

on
him
so
sadly
stern
with
such
surprise
of
hushed
anguish

from

will

some

i
chanced
to
feel
her
pulse
one
night
a
brain
she
has
that
never
errs
and
yet
is
never
nobly
right
it
does
not
leap
to
great
results
but
in
some
corner
out
of
sight
suspects
a
spot
of
latent
blight
and
the
impatient
infinite
she
bargains
haggles
and
consults
her
eye
it
seems
a
chemic
test
and
drops
upon
you
like
an
acid
it
bites
you
with
unconscious
zest
so
clear
and
bright
so
coldly
placid
it
holds
you
quietly
aloof
it
holds
and
yet
it
does
not
win
you
it
merely
puts
you
to
the
proof
and
sorts
what
qualities
are
in
you
it
smiles
but
never
brings
you
nearer
it
lights
her
nature
draws
not
nigh
is
but
that
yours
is
growing
clearer
to
her
assays
yes
try

try
you
get
no

her

there
you

your

laid
upon
their

ordered
mind

what
of

no

the

in

clear
brain

day
and

no

full
of

that
palpitates
with

likest
to
bethesda
stream
forewarned
through
all
its

springs
white
with
the
angel
coming
gleam
and
rippled
with
his
fanning
wings
hear
him
unfold
his
plots
and
plans
and
larger
destinies
seem
man
you
conjure
from
his
glowing
face
the
omen
of
a
fairer
race
with
one
grand
trope
he
boldly
spans
the
gulf
wherein
so
many
fall
possible
and
actual
his
first
swift
word
exuberant
with
conscious
god
out
of
the
choir
of
planets
blots
the
present
earth
with
all
its
spots
himself
unshaken
as
the
sky
his
words
like
whirlwinds
spin
on
high
systems
and
creeds
pellmell
together
is
strange
as
to
a
deaf
man
eye
while
trees
uprooted
splinter
by
the
dumb
turmoil
of
stormy
weather
less
of
iconoclast
than
shaper
his
spirit
safe
behind
the
reach
of
the
tornado
of
his
speech
burns
calmly
as
a
glowworm
taper
so
great
in
speech
but
ah
in
act
so
overrun
with
vermin
troubles
the
coarse
ugly
fact
of
life
collapses
all
his
bubbles
had
he
but
lived
in
plato
day
he
might
unless
my
fancy
errs
have
shared
that
golden
voice
sway
barefooted
philosophers
our
nipping
climate
hardly
suits
the
ripening
of
ideal
fruits
his
theories
vanquish
us
all
summer
but
winter
makes
him
dumb
and
dumber
to
see
him
mid
life
needful
things
is
something
painfully
bewildering
he
seems
an
angel
with
clipt
wings
tied
to
a
mortal
wife
and
children
and
by
a
brother
seraph
taken
in
the
act
of
eating
eggs
and
bacon
like
a
clear
fountain
his
desire
exults
and
leaps
toward
the
light
in
every
drop
it
says
aspire
striving
for
more
ideal
height
and
as
the
fountain
falling
thence
crawls
baffled
through
the
common
gutter
so
from
his
speech
eminence
he
shrinks
into
the
present
tense
unkinged
by
foolish
bread
and
butter
yet
smile
not
worldling
for
in
deeds
not
all
of
life
that
brave
and
wise
is
he
strews
an
ampler
future
seeds
is
your
fault
if
no
harvest
rises
smooth
back
the
sneer
for
is
it
naught
that
all
he
is
and
has
is
beauty
by
soul
the
soul
gains
must
be
wrought
the
actual
claims
our
coarser
thought
the
ideal
hath
its
higher
duties
on
a
portrait
of
dante
by
giotto
can
this
be
thou
who
lean
and
pale
with
such
immitigable
eye
didst
look
upon
those
writhing
souls
in
bale
and
note
each
vengeance
and
pass
by
unmoved
save
when
thy
heart
by
chance
cast
backward
one
forbidden
glance
and
saw
francesca
with
child
glee
subdue
and
mount
thy
knee
and
with
proud
hands
control
its
fiery
prance
with
lids
and
smooth
round
brow
and
eye
remote
that
inly
sees
fair
beatrice
spirit
wandering
now
in
some
hesperides
thou
movest
through
the
jarring
street
secluded
from
the
noise
of
feet
by
her
in
thy
hand
thy
branch
of
palm
from
holy
land
no
trace
is
here
of
ruin
fiery
sleet
yet
there
is
something
round
thy
lips
that
prophesies
the
coming
doom
the
soft
gray
ere
the
eclipse
notches
the
perfect
disk
with
gloom
a
something
that
would
banish
thee
and
thine
untamed
pursuer
be
from
men
and
their
unworthy
fates
though
florence
had
not
shut
her
gates
and
grief
had
loosed
her
clutch
and
let
thee
free
ah
he
who
follows
fearlessly
the
beckonings
of
a
shall
wander
and
without
the
world
decree
a
banished
man
in
field
and
mart
harder
than
florence
walls
the
bar
which
with
deaf
sternness
holds
him
far
from
home
and
friends
till
death
release
and
makes
his
only
prayer
for
peace
like
thine
scarred
veteran
of
a
lifelong
war
on
the
death
of
a
friend
child
death
never
came
so
nigh
to
me
before
nor
showed
me
his
mild
face
oft
had
i
mused
of
calm
and
peace
and
deep
forgetfulness
of
folded
hands
closed
eye
and
heart
at
rest
and
slumber
sound
beneath
a
flowery
turf
of
faults
forgotten
and
an
inner
place
kept
sacred
for
us
in
the
heart
of
friends
but
these
were
idle
fancies
satisfied
with
the
mere
husk
of
this
great
mystery
and
dwelling
in
the
outward
shows
of
things
heaven
is
not
mounted
to
on
wings
of
dreams
nor
doth
the
unthankful
happiness
of
youth
aim
thitherward
but
floats
from
bloom
to
bloom
with
earth
warm
patch
of
sunshine
well
content
is
sorrow
builds
the
shining
ladder
up
whose
golden
rounds
are
our
calamities
whereon
our
firm
feet
planting
nearer
god
the
spirit
climbs
and
hath
its
eyes
unsealed
true
is
it
that
death
face
seems
stern
and
cold
when
he
is
sent
to
summon
those
we
love
but
all
god
angels
come
to
us
disguised
sorrow
and
sickness
poverty
and
death
one
after
other
lift
their
frowning
masks
and
we
behold
the
seraph
face
beneath
all
radiant
with
the
glory
and
the
calm
of
having
looked
upon
the
front
of
god
with
every
anguish
of
our
earthly
part
the
spirit
sight
grows
clearer
this
was
meant
when
jesus
touched
the
blind
man
lids
with
clay
life
is
the
jailer
death
the
angel
sent
to
draw
the
unwilling
bolts
and
set
us
free
he
flings
not
ope
the
ivory
gate
of
rest
only
the
fallen
spirit
knocks
at
that
but
to
benigner
regions
beckons
us
to
destinies
of
more
rewarded
toil
in
the
hushed
chamber
sitting
by
the
dead
it
grates
on
us
to
hear
the
flood
of
life
whirl
rustling
onward
senseless
of
our
loss
the
bee
hums
on
around
the
blossomed
vine
whirs
the
light
the
cricket
chirps
the
locust
shrill
alarum
stings
the
ear
hard
by
the
cock
shouts
lustily
from
farm
to
farm
his
cheery
brothers
telling
of
the
sun
answer
till
far
away
the
joyance
dies
we
never
knew
before
how
god
had
filled
the
summer
air
with
happy
living
sounds
all
round
us
seems
an
overplus
of
life
and
yet
the
one
dear
heart
lies
cold
and
still
it
is
most
strange
when
the
great
miracle
hath
for
our
sakes
been
done
when
we
have
had
our
inwardest
experience
of
god
when
with
his
presence
still
the
room
expands
and
is
awed
after
him
that
naught
is
changed
that
nature
face
looks
unacknowledging
and
the
mad
world
still
dances
heedless
on
after
its
butterflies
and
gives
no
sign
is
hard
at
first
to
see
it
all
aright
in
vain
faith
blows
her
trump
to
summon
back
her
scattered
troop
yet
through
the
clouded
glass
of
our
own
bitter
tears
we
learn
to
look
undazzled
on
the
kindness
of
god
face
earth
is
too
dark
and
heaven
alone
shines
through
it
is
no
little
thing
when
a
fresh
soul
and
a
fresh
heart
with
their
unmeasured
scope
for
good
not
gravitating
earthward
yet
but
circling
in
diviner
periods
are
sent
into
the
world
no
little
thing
when
this
unbounded
possibility
into
the
outer
silence
is
withdrawn
ah
in
this
world
where
every
guiding
thread
ends
suddenly
in
the
one
sure
centre
death
the
visionary
hand
of
alone
can
fill
desire
cup
to
the
brim
how
changed
dear
friend
are
thy
part
and
thy
child
he
bends
above
cradle
now
or
holds
his
warning
finger
out
to
be
thy
guide
thou
art
the
nurseling
now
he
watches
thee
slow
learning
one
by
one
the
secret
things
which
are
to
him
used
sights
of
every
day
he
smiles
to
see
thy
wondering
glances
con
the
grass
and
pebbles
of
the
spirit
world
to
thee
miraculous
and
he
will
teach
thy
knees
their
due
observances
of
prayer
children
are
god
apostles
day
by

sent
forth
to
preach
of
love
and
hope
and
peace
nor
hath
thy
babe
his
mission
left
undone
to
me
at

his
going
hence
hath
given
serener
thoughts
and
nearer
to
the
skies
and
opened
a
new
fountain
in
my
heart
for
thee
my

as

diary

nevermore
she
came
and
went
as
a

trembles
which
a
bird
lights
on
to
sing
then
leaves
unbent
so
is
my
memory
thrilled
and
stirred
i
only
know
she
came
and
went
as
clasps
some
lake
by
gusts
unriven
the
blue
dome
measureless
content
so
my
soul
held
that
moment
heaven
i
only
know
she
came
and
went
as
at
one
bound
our
swift
spring
heaps
the
orchards
full
of
bloom
and
scent
so
clove
her
may
my
wintry
sleeps
i
only
know
she
came
and
went
an
angel
stood
and
met
my
gaze
through
the
low
doorway
of
my
tent
the
tent
is
struck
the
vision
stays
i
only
know
she
came
and
went
o
when
the
room
grows
slowly
dim
and
life
last
oil
is
nearly
spent
one
gush
of
light
these
eyes
will
brim
only
to
think
she
came
and
went
the
changeling
i
had
a
little
daughter
and
she
was
given
to
me
to
lead
me
gently
backward
to
the
heavenly
father
knee
that
i
by
the
force
of
nature
might
in
some
dim
wise
divine
the
depth
of
his
infinite
patience
to
this
wayward
soul
of
mine
i
know
not
how
others
saw
her
but
to
me
she
was
wholly
fair
and
the
light
of
the
heaven
she
came
from
still
lingered
and
gleamed
in
her
hair
for
it
was
as
wavy
and
golden
and
as
many
changes
took
as
the
shadows
of
ripples
on
the
yellow
bed
of
a
brook
to
what
can
i
liken
her
smiling
upon
me
her
kneeling
lover
how
it
leaped
from
her
lips
to
her
eyelids
and
dimpled
her
wholly
over
till
her
outstretched
hands
smiled
also
and
i
almost
seemed
to
see
the
very
heart
of
her
mother
sending
sun
through
her
veins
to
me
she
had
been
with
us
scarce
a
twelvemonth
and
it
hardly
seemed
a
day
when
a
troop
of
wandering
angels
stole
my
little
daughter
away
or
perhaps
those
heavenly
zingari
but
loosed
the
hampering
strings
and
when
they
had
opened
her
my
little
bird
used
her
wings
but
they
left
in
her
stead
a
changeling
a
little
angel
child
that
seems
like
her
bud
in
full
blossom
and
smiles
as
she
never
smiled
when
i
wake
in
the
morning
i
see
it
where
she
always
used
to
lie
and
i
feel
as
weak
as
a
violet
alone
the
awful
sky
as
weak
yet
as
trustful
also
for
the
whole
year
long
i
see
all
the
wonders
of
faithful
nature
still
worked
for
the
love
of
me
winds
wander
and
dews
drip
earthward
rain
falls
suns
rise
and
set
earth
whirls
and
all
but
to
prosper
a
poor
little
violet
this
child
is
not
mine
as
the
first
was
i
can
not
sing
it
to
rest
i
can
not
lift
it
up
fatherly
and
bliss
it
upon
my
breast
yet
it
lies
in
my
little
one
cradle
and
sits
in
my
little
one
chair
and
the
light
of
the
heaven
she
gone
to
transfigures
its
golden
hair
the
pioneer
what
man
would
live
coffined
with
brick
and
stone
imprisoned
from
the
influences
of
air
and
cramped
with
selfish
everywhere
when
all
before
him
stretches
furrowless
and
lone
the
unmapped
prairie
none
can
fence
or
own
what
man
would
read
and
read
the
selfsame
faces
and
like
the
marbles
which
the
windmill
grinds
rub
smooth
forever
with
the
same
smooth
minds
this
year
retracing
last
year
every
year
dull
traces
when
there
are
woods
and
places
what
man
one
old
thought
would
pore
and
pore
shut
like
a
book
between
its
covers
thin
for
every
fool
to
leave
his
in
when
solitude
is
his
and
god
for
evermore
just
for
the
opening
of
a
paltry
door
what
man
would
watch
life
oozy
element
creep
letheward
forever
when
he
might
down
some
great
river
drift
beyond
men
sight
to
where
the
undethronèd
forest
royal
tent
broods
with
its
hush
half
a
continent
what
man
with
men
would
push
and
altercate
piecing
out
crooked
means
for
crooked
ends
when
he
can
have
the
skies
and
woods
for
friends
snatch
back
the
rudder
of
his
undismantled
fate
and
in
himself
be
ruler
church
and
state
cast
leaves
and
feathers
rot
in
last
year
nest
the
wingèd
brood
flown
thence
new
dwellings
plan
the
serf
of
his
own
past
is
not
a
man
to
change
and
change
is
life
to
move
and
never
rest
not
what
we
are
but
what
we
hope
is
best
the
wild
free
woods
make
no
man
halt
or
blind
cities
rob
men
of
eyes
and
hands
and
feet
patching
one
whole
of
many
incomplete
the
general
preys
upon
the
individual
mind
and
each
alone
is
helpless
as
the
wind
each
man
is
some
man
servant
every
soul
is
by
some
other
presence
quite
discrowned
each
owes
the
next
through
all
the
imperfect
round
yet
not
with
mutual
help
each
man
is
his
own
goal
and
the
whole
earth
must
stop
to
pay
his
toll
here
life
the
undiminished
man
demands
new
faculties
stretch
out
to
meet
new
wants
what
nature
asks
that
nature
also
grants
here

come
out

from

the

can
shatter

freedom
for
you
still
waits
still
looking
backward

but
widens
still
the
irretrievable
space
longing
of
all
the
myriad
moods
of
mind
that
through
the
soul
come
thronging
which
one
was
so
dear
so
kind
so
beautiful
as
longing
the
thing
we
long
for
that
we
are
for
one
transcendent
moment
before
the
present
poor
and
bare
can
make
its
sneering
comment

through

the

immortal
longing

fresh
heavenward
will
with
our
poor
earthward
striving
we
quench

would
we
learn
that
heart
full
scope

we
are
hourly
wronging
our
lives

climb

ah

good

ode
to
france
february
i
as
flake
by
flake
the
beetling
avalanches
build
up
their
imminent
crags
of
noiseless
snow
till
some
chance
thrill
the
loosened
ruin
launches
and
the
blind
havoc
leaps
unwarned
below
so
grew
and
gathered
through
the
silent
years
the
madness
of
a
people
wrong
by
wrong
there
seemed
no
strength
in
the
dumb
toiler
tears
no
strength
in
suffering
but
the
past
was
strong
the
brute
despair
of
trampled
centuries
leaped
up
with
one
hoarse
yell
and
snapped
its
bands
groped
for
its
right
with
horny
callous
hands
and
stared
around
for
god
with
bloodshot
eyes
what
wonder
if
those
palms
were
all
too
hard
for
nice
distinctions
if
that
mænad
throng
they
whose
thick
atmosphere
no
bard
had
shivered
with
the
lightning
of
his
song
brutes
with
the
memories
and
desires
of
men
whose
chronicles
were
writ
with
iron
pen
in
the
crooked
shoulder
and
the
forehead
low
set
wrong
to
balance
wrong
and
physicked
woe
with
woe
ii
they
did
as
they
were
taught
not
theirs
the
blame
if
men
who
scattered
firebrands
reaped
the
flame
they
trampled
peace
beneath
their
savage
feet
and
by
her
golden
tresses
drew
mercy
along
the
pavement
of
the
street
o
freedom
freedom
is
thy
so
gory
red
alas
thy
light
had
shone
in
upon
the
chaos
of
their
lair
they
reared
to
thee
such
symbol
as
they
knew
and
worshipped
it
with
flame
and
blood
a
vengeance
axe
in
hand
that
stood
holding
a
tyrant
head
up
by
the
clotted
hair
iii
what
wrongs
the
oppressor
suffered
these
we
know
these
have
found
piteous
voice
in
song
and
prose
but
for
the
oppressed
their
darkness
and
their
woe
their
grinding
centuries
what
muse
had
those
though
hall
and
palace
had
nor
eyes
nor
ears
hardening
a
people
heart
to
senseless
stone
thou
knowest
them
o
earth
that
drank
their
tears
o
heaven
that
heard
their
inarticulate
moan
they
noted
down
their
fetters
link
by
link
coarse
was
the
hand
that
scrawled
and
red
the
ink
rude
was
their
score
as
suits
unlettered
men
notched
with
a
headman
axe
upon
a
block
what
marvel
if
when
came
the
avenging
shock
was
ate
not
urania
held
the
pen
iv
with
eye
averted
and
an
anguished
frown
loathingly
glides
the
muse
through
scenes
of
strife
where
like
the
heart
of
vengeance
up
and
down
throbs
in
its
framework
the
knife
slow
are
the
steps
of
freedom
but
her
feet
turn
never
backward
hers
no
bloody
glare
her
light
is
calm
and
innocent
and
sweet
and
where
it
enters
there
is
no
despair
not
first
on
palace
and
cathedral
spire
quivers
and
gleams
that
unconsuming
fire
while
these
stand
black
against
her
morning
skies
the
peasant
sees
it
leap
from
peak
to
peak
along
his
hills
the
craftsman
burning
eyes
own
with
cool
tears
its
influence
it
lights
the
poet
heart
up
like
a
star
ah
while
the
tyrant
deemed
it
still
afar
and
twined
with
golden
threads
his
futile
snare
that
swift
convicting
glow
all
round
him
ran
was
close
beside
him
there
sunrise
whose
memnon
is
the
soul
of
man
o
is
this
thy
wisdom
fruit
a
dynasty
plucked
out
as
were
a
weed
grown
rankly
in
a
night
that
leaves
no
seed
could
eighteen
years
strike
down
no
deeper
root
but
now
thy
vulture
eye
was
turned
on
spain
a
shout
from
paris
and
thy
crown
falls
off
thy
race
has
ceased
to
reign
and
thou
become
a
fugitive
and
scoff
slippery
the
feet
that
mount
by
stairs
of
gold
and
weakest
of
all
fences
one
of
steel
go
and
keep
school
again
like
him
of
old
the
syracusan
tyrant
thou
mayst
feel
royal
amid
a
commonweal
vi
not
long
can
he
be
ruler
who
allows
his
time
to
run
before
him
thou
wast
naught
soon
as
the
strip
of
gold
about
thy
brows
was
no
more
emblem
of
the
people
thought
vain
were
thy
bayonets
against
the
foe
thou
hadst
to
cope
with
thou
didst
wage
war
not
with
frenchmen
merely
no
thy
strife
was
with
the
spirit
of
the
age
the
invisible
spirit
whose
first
breath
divine
scattered
thy
frail
endeavor
and
like
poor
last
year
leaves
whirled
thee
and
thine
into
the
dark
forever
vii
is
here
no
triumph
nay
what
though
the
yellow
blood
of
trade
meanwhile
should
pour
along
its
arteries
a
shrunken
flow
and
the
idle
canvas
droop
around
the
shore
these
do
not
make
a
state
nor
keep
it
great
i
think
god
made
the
earth
for
man
not
trade
and
where
each
humblest
human
creature
can
stand
no
more
suspicious
or
afraid
erect
and
kingly
in
his
right
of
nature
to
heaven
and
earth
knit
with
harmonious
ties
where
i
behold
the
exultation
of
manhood
glowing
in
those
eyes
that
had
been
dark
for
ages
or
only
lit
with
bestial
loves
and
rages
there
i
behold
a
nation
the
france
which
lies
between
the
pyrenees
and
rhine
is
the
least
part
of
france
i
see
her
rather
in
the
soul
whose
shine
burns
through
the
craftsman
grimy
countenance
in
the
new
energy
divine
of
toil
enfranchised
glance
viii
and
if
it
be
a
dream
if
the
great
future
be
the
little
past
a
new
mask
which
drops
and
shows
at
last
the
same
weird
mocking
face
to
balk
and
blast
yet
muse
a
gladder
measure
suits
the
theme
and
the
tyrtæan
harp
loves
notes
more
resolute
and
sharp
throbbing
as
throbs
the
bosom
hot
and
fast
such
visions
are
of
morning
theirs
is
no
vague
forewarning
the
dreams
which
nations
dream
come
true
and
shape
the

anew

this

it

ix
since
first
i
heard
our
north
wind
blow
since
first
i
saw
atlantic
throw
on
our
fierce
rocks
his
thunderous
snow
i
loved
thee
freedom
as
a
boy
the
rattle
of
thy
shield
at
marathon
did
with
a
grecian
joy
through
all
my
pulses
run
but
i
have
learned
to
love
thee
now
without
the
helm
upon
thy
gleaming
brow
a
maiden
mild
and
undefiled
like
her
who
bore
the
world
redeeming
child
and
surely
never
did
thy
altars
glance
with
purer
fires
than
now
in
france
while
in
their
bright
white
flashes
wrong
shadow
backward
cast
waves
cowering
the
ashes
of
the
dead
blaspheming
past
the
shapes
of
fallen
giants
his
own
unburied
brood
whose
dead
hands
clench
defiance
at
the
overpowering
good
and
down
the
happy
future
runs
a
flood
of
prophesying
light
it
shows
an
earth
no
longer
stained
with
blood
blossom
and
fruit
where
now
we
see
the
bud
of
brotherhood
and
right
a
parable
said
christ
our
lord
i
will
go
and
see
how
the
men
my
brethren
believe
in
me
he
passed
not
again
through
the
gate
of
birth
but
made
himself
known
to
the
children
of
earth
then
said
the
chief
priests
and
rulers
and
kings
behold
now
the
giver
of
all
good
things
go
to
let
us
welcome
with
pomp
and
state
him
who
alone
is
mighty
and
great
with
carpets
of
gold
the
ground
they
spread
wherever
the
son
of
man
should
tread
and
in
lofty
and
rare
they
lodged
him
and
served
him
with
kingly
fare
great
organs
surged
through
arches
dim
their
jubilant
floods
in
praise
of
him
and
in
church
and
palace
and
he
saw
his
image
high
over
all
but
still
wherever
his
steps
they
led
the
lord
in
sorrow
bent
down
his
head
and
from
under
the
heavy
the
son
of
mary
heard
bitter
groans
and
in
church
and
palace
and
he
marked
great
fissures
that
rent
the
wall
and
opened
wider
and
yet
more
wide
as
the
living
foundation
heaved
and
sighed
have
ye
founded
your
thrones
and
altars
then
on
the
bodies
and
souls
of
living
men
and
think
ye
that
building
shall
endure
which
shelters
the
noble
and
crushes
the
poor
with
gates
of
silver
and
bars
of
gold
ye
have
fenced
my
sheep
from
their
father
fold
i
have
heard
the
dropping
of
their
tears
in
heaven
these
eighteen
hundred
years
o
lord
and
master
not
ours
the
guilt
we
build
but
as
our
fathers
built
behold
thine
images
how
they
stand
sovereign
and
sole
through
all
our
land
our
task
is
hard
with
sword
and
flame
to
hold
thy
earth
forever
the
same
and
with
sharp
crooks
of
steel
to
keep
still
as
thou
leftest
them
thy
sheep
then
christ
sought
out
an
artisan
a
stunted
haggard
man
and
a
motherless
girl
whose
fingers
thin
pushed
from
her
faintly
want
and

he
in
the
midst
of
them

drew
back

for

these

were

true
to
the

creed
what
brought
them
here
they
never

they
fought
as

they
came
three
thousand

died
to
keep
the

upon

dead
ye
are

your

send
courage
forth
and

to
we
too
have
autumns
when
our
leaves
drop
loosely
through
the
dampened
air
when
all
our
good
seems
bound
in
sheaves
and
we
stand
reaped
and
bare
our
seasons
have
no
fixed
returns
without
our
will
they
come
and
go
at
noon
our
sudden
summer
burns
ere
sunset
all
is
snow
but
each
day
brings
less
summer
cheer
crimps
more
our
ineffectual
spring
and
something
earlier
every
year
our
singing
birds
take
wing
as
less
the
olden
glow
abides
and
less
the
chillier
heart
aspires
with
beached
in
past
we
light
our
sullen
fires
by
the
pinched
rushlight
starving
beam
we
cower
and
strain
our
wasted
sight
to
stitch
youth
shroud
up
seam
by
seam
in
the
long
arctic
night
it
was
not
so
we
once
were
young
when
spring
to
womanly
summer
turning
her
on
each
strung
in
the
red
sunrise
burning
we
trusted
then
aspired
believed
that
earth
could
be
remade
ah
why
be
ever
undeceived
why
give
up
faith
for
sorrow
o
thou
whose
days
are
yet
all
spring
faith
blighted
once
is
past
retrieving
experience
is
a
dumb
dead
thing
the
victory
in
believing
freedom
are
we
then
wholly
fallen
can
it
be
that
thou
north
wind
that
from
thy
mountains
bringest
their
spirit
to
our
plains
and
thou
blue
sea
who
on
our
rocks
thy
wreaths
of
freedom
flingest
as
on
an
altar
can
it
be
that
ye
have
wasted
inspiration
on
dead
ears
dulled
with
the
too
familiar
clank
of
chains
the
people
heart
is
like
a
harp
for
years
hung
where
some
petrifying
torrent
rains
its
spray
the
stiffened
chords
faint
and
more
faint
make
answer
to
the
tears
that
drip
upon
them
idle
are
all
words
only
a
silver
plectrum
wakes
the
tone
deep
buried
that
stone
we
are
not
free
freedom
doth
not
consist
in
musing
with
our
faces
toward
the
past
while
petty
cares
and
crawling
interests
twist
their
about
us
which
at
last
grow
strong
as
iron
chains
to
cramp
and
bind
in
formal
narrowness
heart
soul
and
mind
freedom
is
recreated
year
by
year
in
hearts
wide
open
on
the
godward
side
in
souls
as
the
whirling
sphere
in
minds
that
sway
the
future
like
a
tide
no
broadest
creeds
can
hold
her
and
no
codes
she
chooses
men
for
her
august
abodes
building
them
fair
and
fronting
to
the
dawn
yet
when
we
seek
her
we
but
find
a
few
light
footprints
leading
through
the
dew
before
the
day
had
risen
she
was
gone
and
we
must
follow
swiftly
runs
she
on
and
if
our
steps
should
slacken
in
despair
half
turns
her
face
half
smiles
through
golden
hair
forever
yielding
never
wholly
won
that
is
not
love
which
pauses
in
the
race
two
names
on
fleeting
sand
to
trace
freedom
gained
yesterday
is
no
more
ours
men
gather
but
dry
seeds
of
last
year
flowers
still
there
a
charm
ungranted
still
a
grace
still
rosy
hope
the
free
the
unattained
makes
us
possession
languid
hand
let
fall
is
but
a
fragment
of
ourselves
is
gained
the
future
brings
us
more
but
never
all
and
as
the
finder
of
some
unknown
realm
mounting
a
summit
whence
he
thinks
to
see
on
either
side
of
him
the
imprisoning
sea
beholds
above
the
clouds
that
overwhelm
the
peak
after
snowy
peak
stretch
out
of
sight
each
like
a
silver
helm
beneath
its
plume
of
smoke
sublime
and
bleak
and
what
he
thought
an
island
finds
to
be
a
continent
to
him
first
oped
so
we
can
from
our
height
of
freedom
look
along
a
boundless
future
ours
if
we
be
strong
or
if
we
shrink
better
remount
our
ships
and
fleeing
god
express

trace
back
the
mayflower
to
europe
entering
her
eclipse
bibliolatres
bowing
thyself
in
dust
before
a

thinking
the
great
god
is
thine
alone
o
rash
iconoclast
thou
wilt
not
brook
what
gods
the
heathen
carves
in
wood
and
stone
as
if
the
shepherd
who
from
outer
cold
leads
all
his
shivering
lambs
to
one
sure
fold
were
careful
for
the
fashion
of
his
crook
there
is
no
broken
reed
so
poor
and
base
no
rush
the
bending
tilt
of
blue
but
he
therewith
the
ravening
wolf
can
chase
and
guide
his
flock
to
springs
and
pastures
new
through
ways
unlooked
for
and
through
many
lands
far
from
the
rich
folds
built
with
human

the
gracious
footprints
of
his

and
what
art
thou
own
brother
of
the
clod
that
from
his
hand
the
crook
wouldst
snatch
away
and
shake
instead
thy
dry

sapless
rod
to
scare
the
sheep
out
of

yea
what

but
he
who

intent

still
and

hears
its

lore
slowly
the

of
the
race

writ
and

hushed
with
broad
sunlight
lies
the
hill
and
minuting
the
long

loss
the

shadow
slow
and
still
creeps
its
dial
of
gray
moss
warm
noon
brims
full
the
valley
cup
the
aspen
leaves
are
scarce
astir
only
the
little
mill
sends
up
its
busy
burr
climbing
the
wall
that
hems
the
road
along
the
brink
from
the
arching
my
footstep
scares
the
shy
chewink
beneath
a
bony
buttonwood
the
mill
red
door
lets
forth
the
din
the
whitened
miller
flits
past
the
square
of
dark
within
no
mountain
torrent
strength
is
here
sweet
beaver
child
of
forest
still
heaps
its
small
pitcher
to
the
ear
and
gently
waits
the
miller
will
swift
slips
undine
along
the
race
unheard
and
then
with
flashing
bound
floods
the
dull
wheel
with
light
and
grace
and
laughing
hunts
the
loath
drudge
round
the
miller
dreams
not
at
what
cost
the
quivering
hum
and
whirl
nor
how
for
every
turn
are
tost
armfuls
of
diamond
and
of
pearl
but
summer
cleared
my
happier
eyes
with
drops
of
some
celestial
juice
to
see
how
beauty
underlies
for
evermore
each
form
of
use
and
more
methought
i
saw
that
flood
which
now
so
dull
and
darkling
steals
thick
here
and
there
with
human
blood
to
turn
the
world
laborious
wheels
no
more
than
doth
the
miller
there
shut
in
our
several
cells
do
we
know
with
what
waste
of
beauty
rare
moves
every
day
machinery
surely
the
wiser
time
shall
come
when
this
fine
overplus
of
might
no
longer
sullen
slow
and
dumb
shall
leap
to
music
and
to
light
in
that
new
childhood
of
the
earth
life
of
itself
shall
dance
and
play
fresh
blood
in
time
shrunk
veins
make
mirth
and
labor
meet
delight
appledore
how
looks
appledore
in
a
storm
i
have
seen
it
when
its
crags
seemed
frantic
butting
against
the
maddened
atlantic
when
surge
after
surge
would
heap
enorme
cliffs
of
emerald
topped
with
snow
that
lifted
and
lifted
and
then
let
go
a
great
white
avalanche
of
thunder
a
grinding
blinding
deafening
ire
monadnock
might
have
trembled
under
and
the
island
whose
pierce
below
to
where
they
are
warmed
with
the
central
fire
you
could
feel
its
granite
fibres
racked
as
it
seemed
to
plunge
with
a
shudder
and
thrill
right
at
the
breast
of
the
swooping
hill
and
to
rise
again
snorting
a
cataract
of
from
every
cranny
and
ledge
while
the
sea
drew
its
breath
in
hoarse
and
deep
and
the
next
vast
breaker
curled
its
edge
gathering
itself
for
a
mighty
leap
north
east
and
south
there
are
reefs
and
breakers
you
would
never
dream
of
in
smooth
weather
that
toss
and
gore
the
sea
for
acres
bellowing
and
gnashing
and
snarling
together
look
northward
where
duck
island
lies
and
over
its
crown
you
will
see
arise
against
a
background
of
slaty
skies
a
row
of
pillars
still
and
white
that
glimmer
and
then
are
out
of
sight
as
if
the
moon
should
suddenly
kiss
while
you
crossed
the
gusty
desert
by
night
the
long
colonnades
of
persepolis
and
then
as
sudden
a
darkness
should
follow
to
gulp
the
whole
scene
at
single
swallow
the
city
ghost
the
drear
brown
waste
and
the
string
of
camels
look
southward
for
white
island
light
the
lantern
stands
ninety
feet
the
tide
there
is
first
a
of
tumult
and
fight
of
dash
and
roar
and
tumble
and
fright
and
surging
bewilderment
wild
and
wide
where
the
breakers
struggle
left
and
right
then
a
mile
or
more
of
rushing
sea
and
then
the
slim
and
lone
and
whenever
the
whole
weight
of
ocean
is
thrown
full
and
fair
on
white
island
head
a
great
you
will
see
lifting
himself
up
silently
high
and
huge
the
top
with
hands
of
wavering
spray
outspread
groping
after
the
little
tower
that
seems
to
shrink
and
shorten
and
cower
till
the
monster
arms
of
a
sudden
drop
and
silently
and
fruitlessly
he
sinks
again
into
the
sea
you
meanwhile
where
drenched
you
stand
awaken
once
more
to
the
rush
and
roar
and
on
the
tighten
your
hand
as
you
turn
and
see
a
valley
deep
that
was
not
there
a
moment
before
suck
rattling
down
between
you
and
a
heap
of
toppling
billow
whose
instant
fall
must
sink
the
whole
island
once
for
all
or
watch
the
silenter
stealthier
seas
feeling
their
way
to
you
more
and
more
if
they
once
should
clutch
you
high
as
the
knees
they
would
whirl
you
down
like
a
sprig
of
kelp
beyond
all
reach
of
hope
or
help
and
such
in
a
storm
is
appledore
dara
when
persia
sceptre
trembled
in
a
hand
wilted
by
and
all
the
land
was
hovered
over
by
those
vulture
ills
that
snuff
decaying
empire
from
afar
then
with
a
nature
balanced
as
a
star
dara
arose
a
shepherd
of
the
hills
he
who
had
governed
fleecy
subjects
well
made
his
own
village
by
the
spell
secure
and
peaceful
as
a
guarded
fold
till
gathering
strength
by
slow
and
wise
degrees
under
his
sway
to
neighbor
villages
order
returned
and
faith
and
justice
old
now
when
it
fortuned
that
a
king
more
wise
endued
the
realm
with
brain
and
hands
and
eyes
he
sought
on
every
side
men
brave
and
just
and
having
heard
the
praise
how
he
rendered
the
mould
of
elder
days
to
dara
gave
a
satrapy
in
trust
so
dara
shepherded
a
province
wide
nor
in
his
viceroy
sceptre
took
more
pride
than
in
his
crook
before
but
envy
finds
more
soil
in
cities
than
on
mountains
bare
and
the
frank
sun
of
spirits
clear
and
rare
breeds
poisonous
fogs
in
low
and
marish
minds
soon
it
was
whispered
at
the
royal
ear
that
though
wise
dara
province
year
by
year
like
a
great
sponge
drew
wealth
and
plenty
up
yet
when
he
squeezed
it
at
the
king
behest
some
golden
drops
more
rich
than
all
the
rest
went
to
the
filling
of
his
private
cup
for
proof
they
said
that
he
went
a
chest
beneath
whose
weight
the
camel
bent
went
guarded
and
no
other
eye
had
seen
what
was
therein
save
only
dara
own
yet
when
was
opened
all
his
tent
was
known
to
glow
and
lighten
with
heapt
jewels
sheen
the
king
set
forth
for
dara
province
straight
where
as
was
fit
outside
his
city
gate
the
viceroy
met
him
with
a
stately
train
and
there
with
archers
circled
close
at
hand
a
camel
with
the
chest
was
seen
to
stand
the
king
grew
red
for
thus
the
guilt
was
plain
open
me
now
he
cried
yon
was
done
and
only
a
worn
shepherd
vest
was
found
within
some
blushed
and
hung
the
head
not
dara
open
as
the
sky
blue
roof
he
stood
and
o
my
lord
behold
the
proof
that
i
was
worthy
of
my
trust
he
said
for
ruling
men
lo
all
the
charm
i
had
my
soul
in
those
coarse
vestments
ever
clad
still
to
the
unstained
past
kept
true
and
leal
still
on
these
plains
could
breathe
her
mountain
air
and
fortune
heaviest
gifts
serenely
bear
which
bend
men
from
the
truth
and
make
them
reel
to
govern
wisely
i
had
shown
small
skill
were
i
not
lord
of
simple
dara
still
that

no

yet
put

to
the
heavy
world
with
less
what
need
of
help
he
knew
how
types
were
set
he
had
a

thou

from

thy

bends
itself
to

perfect
what
it

all
the

that
it

more

than
this
in

from

thy

shows
me
in

at
full
but
i

drooped
mine
eyes
i
could
not
see
that
sorrow
in
our
happy
world
must
be
love
deepest
spokesman
and

but
as
a
mother
feels
her
child
first
stir
under
her

so
felt
i
instantly
deep
in
my
soul
another
bond
to
thee
thrill
with
that
life
we
saw
depart
from
her
o
mother
of
our
twice
dear
death
knits
as
well
as
parts
and
still
i

her

radiance
shall
enfold
us
here

borne
up
by
inward

the

glooms
of
space
without
a

to
print
on
farthest

her
pitying
kiss
whether
my
heart
hath
wiser
grown
or
not
in
these
three
years
since
i
to
thee
inscribed
mine
own
betrothed
the
firstlings
of
my
muse
poor
windfalls
of
unripe
experience
young
buds
plucked
hastily
by
childish
hands
not
patient
to
await
more
flowers
at
least
it
hath
seen
more
of
life
and
men
and
pondered
more
and
grown
a
shade
more
sad
yet
with
no
loss
of
hope
or
settled
trust
in
the
benignness
of
that
providence
which
shapes
from
out
our
elements
awry
the
grace
and
order
that
we
wonder
at
the
mystic
harmony
of
right
and
wrong
both
working
out
his
wisdom
and
our
good
a
trust
beloved
chiefly
learned
of
thee
who
hast
that
gift
of
patient
tenderness
the
instinctive
wisdom
of
a
woman
heart
they
tell
us
that
our
land
was
made
for
song
with
its
huge
rivers
and
peaks
its
lakes
and
mighty
cataracts
its
forests
vast
and
hoar
and
prairies
wide
and
mounds
that
tell
of
wondrous
tribes
extinct
but
poesy
springs
not
from
rocks
and
woods
her
womb
and
cradle
are
the
human
heart
and
she
can
find
a
nobler
theme
for
song
in
the
most
loathsome
man
that
blasts
the
sight
than
in
the
broad
expanse
of
sea
and
shore
between
the
frozen
deserts
of
the
poles
all
nations
have
their
message
from
on
high
each
the
messiah
of
some
central

for
the
fulfilment
and
delight
of
man
one
has
to
teach
that
labor
is
divine
another
freedom
and
another

and
all
that
god
is
and
just
the
happy
centre
and
calm
heart
of
all
are
then
our
woods
our
mountains
and
our
streams
needful
to
teach
our
poets
how
to
sing
o
maiden
rare
far
other
thoughts
were
ours
when
we
have
sat
by
ocean
foaming
marge
and
watched
the
waves
leap
roaring
on
the
rocks
than
young
leander
and
his
hero
had
gazing
from
sestos
to
the
other
shore
the
moon
looks
down
and
ocean
worships
her
stars
rise
and
set
and
seasons
come
and
go
even
as
they
did
in
homer
elder
time
but
we
behold
them
not
with
grecian
eyes
then
they
were
types
of
beauty
and
of
strength
but
now
of
freedom
unconfined
and
pure
subject
alone
to
order
higher
law
what
cares
the
russian
serf
or
southern
slave
though
we
should
speak
as
man
spake
never
yet
of
gleaming
hudson
broad
magnificence
or
green
niagara
roar
our
country
hath
a
gospel
of
her
own
to
preach
and
practise
before
all
the
world
the
freedom
and
divinity
of
man
the
glorious
claims
of
human
brotherhood
which
to
pay
nobly
as
a
freeman
should
gains
the
sole
wealth
that
will
not
fly
away
and
the
soul
fealty
to
none
but
god
these
are
realities
which
make
the
shows
of
outward
nature
be
they
so
grand
seem
small
and
worthless
and
contemptible
these
are
the
for
our
bards
which
stretch
far
upward
into
heaven
itself
and
give
such
and
exulting
view
of
hope
and
faith
and
onward
destiny
that
shrunk
parnassus
to
a
molehill
dwindles
our
new

like

face
of
night
the
herald
of
a
fuller
truth
than
yet
hath
gleamed
upon
the
upraisèd
face
of
man
since
the
earth
glittered
in
her
stainless
prime
of
a
more
glorious
sunrise
than
of
old
drew
wondrous
melodies
from
memnon
huge
yea
draws
them
still
though
now
he
sits
in
the

flood
of
whirling
sand
and
looks
across
the
wastes
of
endless
gray
sole
wreck
where
once
his
thebes
pained
with
her
mighty
hum
the
calm
blue
heaven
shall
the
dull
stone
pay
grateful
orisons
and
we
till
noonday
bar
the
splendor
out
lest
it
reproach
and
chide
our
sluggard
hearts
in
the
down
of
prejudice
and
be
content
though
clad
with
to
hop
about
from
perch
to
perch
in
paltry
cages
of
dead
men
dead
thoughts
o
rather
like
the
soar
and
sing
and
let
our
gushing
songs
befit
the
dawn
and
sunrise
and
the
yet
unshaken
dew
brimming
the
chalice
of
each
hope
whose
blithe
front
turns
to
greet
the
growing
day
never
had
poets
such
high
call
before
never
can
poets
hope
for
higher
one
and
if
they
be
but
faithful
to
their
trust
earth
will
remember
them
with
love
and
joy
and
o
far
better
god
will
not
forget
for
he
who
settles
freedom
principles
writes
the
of
all
tyranny
who
speaks
the
truth
stabs
falsehood
to
the
heart
and
his
mere
word
makes
despots
tremble
more
than
ever
brutus
with
his

wait
for
no

from
waterfalls

nor
dream
that
tales

repay
the
finding
of
this
western
world
or
needed
half
the
globe
to
give
them
birth
spirit
supreme
of
freedom
not
for
this
did
great
columbus
tame
his
eagle
soul
to
jostle
with
the
daws
that
perch
in
courts
not
for
this
friendless
on
an
unknown
sea
coping
with
mad
waves
and
more
mutinous
spirits
battled
he
with
the
dreadful
ache
at
heart
which
tempts
with
devilish
subtleties
of
doubt
the
hermit
of
that
loneliest
solitude
the
silent
desert
of
a
great
new
thought
though
loud
niagara
were
struck
dumb
yet
would
this
cataract
of
boiling
life
rush
plunging
on
and
on
to
endless
deeps
and
utter
thunder
till
the
world
shall
cease
a
thunder
worthy
of
the
poet
song
and
which
alone
can
fill
it
with
true
life
the
high
evangel
to
our
country
granted
could
make
apostles
yea
with
tongues
of
fire
of
hearts
back
again
to
clay
is
the
soul
only
that
is
national
and
he
who
pays
true
loyalty
to
that
alone
can
claim
the
wreath
of
patriotism
beloved
if
i
wander
far
and
oft
from
that
which
i
believe
and
feel
and
know
thou
wilt
forgive
not
with
a
sorrowing
heart
but
with
a
strengthened
hope
of
better
things
knowing
that
i
though
often
blind
and
false
to
those
i
love
and
o
more
false
than
all
unto
myself
have
been
most
true
to
thee
and
that
whoso
in
one
thing
hath
been
true
can
be
as
true
in
all
therefore
thy
hope
may
yet
not
prove
unfruitful
and
thy
love
meet
day
by
day
with
less
unworthy
thanks
whether
as
now
we
journey
hand
in
hand
or
parted
in
the
body
yet

the
musing

beginning
doubtfully
and
far
away
first
lets
his
fingers
wander
as
they
list
and
builds
a
bridge
from
dreamland
for
his
lay
then
as
the
touch
of
his
loved
instrument
gives
hope
and
fervor
nearer
draws
his
theme
first
guessed
by
faint
auroral
flushes
sent
along
the
wavering
vista
of
his
dream
not

around
our
infancy
doth
heaven
with
all
its
splendors
lie
daily
with
souls
that
cringe
and

we

climb
and
know
it
not
over
our
manhood
bend
the
skies
against
our
fallen
and
traitor
lives
the
great
winds
utter
prophecies
with
our
faint
hearts
the
mountain
strives
its
arms
outstretched
the
druid
wood
waits
with
its
benedicite
and
to
our

drowsy

still
shouts

what

then
if

then
heaven
tries
the
earth
if
it
be
in
tune
and
over
it
softly
her
warm
ear
lays
whether
we
look
or
whether
we
listen
we
hear
life
murmur
or
see
it
glisten
every
clod
feels
a
stir
of
might
an
instinct
within
it
that
reaches
and
towers
and
groping
blindly
above
it
for
light
climbs
to
a
soul
in
grass
and
flowers
the
flush
of
life
may
well
be
seen
thrilling
back
over
hills
and
valleys
the
cowslip
startles
in
meadows
green
the
buttercup
catches
the
sun
in
its
chalice
and
there
never
a
leaf
nor
a
blade
too
mean
to
be
some
happy
creature
palace
the
little
bird
sits
at
his
door
in
the
sun
atilt
like
a
blossom
among
the
leaves
and
lets
his
illumined
being
with
the
deluge
of
summer
it
receives
his
mate
feels
the
eggs
beneath
her
wings
and
the
heart
in
her
dumb
breast
flutters
and
sings
he
sings
to
the
wide
world
and
she
to
her
nest
in
the
nice
ear
of
nature
which
song
is
the
best
now
is
the
of
the
year
and
whatever
of
life
hath
ebbed
away
comes
flooding
back
with
a
ripply
cheer
into
every
bare
inlet
and
creek
and
bay
now
the
heart
is
so
full
that
a
drop
overfills
it
we
are
happy
now
because
god
wills
it
no
matter
how
barren
the
past
may
have
been
is
enough
for
us
now
that
the
leaves
are
green
we
sit
in
the
warm
shade
and
feel
right
well
how
the
sap
creeps
up
and
the
blossoms
swell
we
may
shut
our
eyes
but
we
can
not
help
knowing
that
skies
are
clear
and
grass
is
growing
the
breeze
comes
whispering
in
our
ear
that
dandelions
are
blossoming
near
that
maize
has
sprouted
that
streams
are
flowing
that
the
river
is
bluer
than
the
sky
that
the
robin
is
plastering
his
house
hard
by
and
if
the
breeze
kept
the
good
news
back
for
other
couriers
we
should
not
lack
we
could
guess
it
all
by
yon
heifer
lowing
and
hark
how
clear
bold
chanticleer
warmed
with
the
new
wine
of
the
year
tells
all
in
his
lusty
crowing
joy
comes
grief
goes
we
know
not
how
everything
is
happy
now
everything
is
upward
striving
is
as
easy
now
for
the
heart
to
be
true
as
for
grass
to
be
green
or
skies
to
be
blue
is
the
natural
way
of
living
who
knows
whither
the
clouds
have
fled
in
the
unscarred
heaven
they
leave
no
wake
and
the
eyes
forget
the
tears
they
have
shed
the
heart
forgets
its
sorrow
and
ache
the
soul
partakes
the
season
youth
and
the
sulphurous
rifts
of
passion
and
woe
lie
deep
a
silence
pure
and
smooth
like
craters
healed
with
snow
what
wonder
if
sir
launfal
now
remembered
the
keeping
of
his
vow
i
my
golden
spurs
now
bring
to
me
and
bring
to
me
my
richest
mail
for
i
go
over
land
and
sea
in
search
of
the
holy
grail
shall
never
a
bed
for
me
be
spread
nor
shall
a
pillow
be
under
my
head
till
i
begin
my
vow
to
keep
here
on
the
rushes
will
i
sleep
and
perchance
there
may
come
a
vision
true
ere
day
create
the
world
anew
slowly
sir
launfal
eyes
grew
dim
slumber
fell
like
a
cloud
on
him
and
into
his
soul
the
vision
flew
ii
the
crows
flapped
over
by
twos
and
threes
in
the
pool
drowsed
the
cattle
up
to
their
knees
the
little
birds
sang
as
if
it
were
the
one
day
of
summer
in
all
the
year
and
the
very
leaves
seemed
to
sing
on
the
trees
the
castle
alone
in
the
landscape
lay
like
an
outpost
of
winter
dull
and
gray
was
the
proudest
hall
in
the
north
countree
and
never
its
gates
might
opened
be
save
to
lord
or
lady
of
high
degree
summer
besieged
it
on
every
side
but
the
churlish
stone
her
assaults
defied
she
could
not
scale
the
chilly
wall
though
round
it
for
leagues
her
pavilions
tall
stretched
left
and
right
over
the
hills
and
out
of
sight
green
and
broad
was
every
tent
and
out
of
each
a
murmur
went
till
the
breeze
fell
off
at
night
iii
the
drawbridge
dropped
with
a
surly
clang
and
through
the
dark
arch
a
charger
sprang
bearing
sir
launfal
the
maiden
knight
in
his
gilded
mail
that
flamed
so
bright
it
seemed
the
dark
castle
had
gathered
all
those
shafts
the
fierce
sun
had
shot
over
its
wall
in
his
siege
of
three
hundred
summers
long
and
binding
them
all
in
one
blazing
sheaf
had
cast
them
forth
so
young
and
strong
and
lightsome
as
a
sir
launfal
flashed
forth
in
his
unscarred
mail
to
seek
in
all
climes
for
the
holy
grail
iv
it
was
morning
on
hill
and
stream
and
tree
and
morning
in
the
young
knight
heart
only
the
castle
moodily
rebuffed
the
gifts
of
the
sunshine
free
and
gloomed
by
itself
apart
the
season
brimmed
all
other
things
up
full
as
the
rain
fills
the
cup
as
sir
launfal
made
morn
through
the
darksome
gate
he
was
of
a
leper
crouched
by
the
same
who
begged
with
his
hand
and
moaned
as
he
sate
and
a
loathing
over
sir
launfal
came
the
sunshine
went
out
of
his
soul
with
a
thrill
the
flesh
his
armor
shrink
and
crawl
and
midway
its
leap
his
heart
stood
still
like
a
frozen
waterfall
for
this
man
so
foul
and
bent
of
stature
rasped
harshly
against
his
dainty
nature
and
seemed
the
one
blot
on
the
summer
morn
so
he
tossed
him
a
piece
of
gold
in
scorn
vi
the
leper
raised
not
the
gold
from
the
dust
better
to
me
the
poor
man
crust
better
the
blessing
of
the
poor
though
i
turn
me
empty
from
his
door
that
is
no
true
alms
which
the
hand
can
hold
he
gives
nothing
but
worthless
gold
who
gives
from
a
sense
of
duty
but
he
who
gives
a
slender
mite
and
gives
to
that
which
is
out
of
sight
that
thread
of
the
beauty
which
runs
through
all
and
doth
all
unite
the
hand
can
not
clasp
the
whole
of
his
alms
the
heart
outstretches
its
eager
palms
for
a
god
goes
with
it
and
makes
it
store
to
the
soul
that
was
starving
in
darkness
before
prelude
to
part
second
down
swept
the
chill
wind
from
the
mountain
peak
from
the
snow
five
thousand
summers
old
on
open
wold
and
bleak
it
had
gathered
all
the
cold
and
whirled
it
like
sleet
on
the
wanderer
cheek
it
carried
a
shiver
everywhere
from
the
unleafed
boughs
and
pastures
bare
the
little
brook
heard
it
and
built
a
roof
which
he
could
house
him
all
night
by
the
white
stars
frosty
gleams
he
groined
his
arches
and
matched
his
beams
slender
and
clear
were
his
crystal
spars
as
the
lashes
of
light
that
trim
the
stars
he
sculptured
every
summer
delight
in
his
halls
and
chambers
out
of
sight
sometimes
his
tinkling
waters
slipt
down
through
a
long
sparkling
aisles
of
trees
bending
to
counterfeit
a
breeze
sometimes
the
roof
no
fretwork
knew
but
silvery
mosses
that
downward
grew
sometimes
it
was
carved
in
sharp
relief
with
quaint
arabesques
of
leaf
sometimes
it
was
simply
smooth
and
clear
for
the
gladness
of
heaven
to
shine
through
and
here
he
had
caught
the
nodding
and
hung
them
thickly
with
diamond
drops
that
crystalled
the
beams
of
moon
and
sun
and
made
a
star
of
every
one
no
mortal
builder
most
rare
device
could
match
this
of
ice
was
as
if
every
image
that
mirrored
lay
in
his
depths
serene
through
the
summer
day
each
fleeting
shadow
of
earth
and
sky
lest
the
happy
model
should
be
lost
had
been
mimicked
in
fairy
masonry
by
the
elfin
builders
of
the
frost
within
the
hall
are
song
and
laughter
the
cheeks
of
christmas
glow
red
and
jolly
and
sprouting
is
every
corbel
and
rafter
with
lightsome
green
of
ivy
and
holly
through
the
deep
gulf
of
the
chimney
wide
wallows
the
roaring
tide
the
broad
droop
and
flap
and
belly
and
tug
as
a
flag
in
the
wind
like
a
locust
shrills
the
imprisoned
sap
hunted
to
death
in
its
galleries
blind
and
swift
little
troops
of
silent
sparks
now
pausing
now
scattering
away
as
in
fear
go
threading
the
tangled
darks
like
herds
of
startled
deer
but
the
wind
without
was
eager
and
sharp
of
sir
launfal
gray
hair
it
makes
a
harp
and
rattles
and
wrings
the
icy
strings
singing
in
dreary
monotone
a
christmas
carol
of
its
own
whose
burden
still
as
he
might
guess
was
shelterless
shelterless
shelterless
the
voice
of
the
seneschal
flared
like
a
torch
as
he
shouted
the
wanderer
away
from
the
porch
and
he
sat
in
the
gateway
and
saw
all
night
the
great
so
cheery
and
bold
through
the
of
the
castle
old
build
out
its
piers
of
ruddy
light
against
the
drift
of
the
cold
i
there
was
never
a
leaf
on
bush
or
tree
the
bare
boughs
rattled
shudderingly
the
river
was
numb
and
could
not
speak
for
the
weaver
winter
its
shroud
had
spun
a
single
crow
on
the
bleak
from
his
shining
feathers
shed
off
the
cold
sun
again
it
was
morning
but
shrunk
and
cold
as
if
her
veins
were
sapless
and
old
and
she
rose
up
decrepitly
for
a
last
dim
look
at
earth
and
sea
ii
sir
launfal
turned
from
his
own
hard
gate
for
another
heir
in
his
earldom
sate
an
old
bent
man
worn
out
and
frail
he
came
back
from
seeking
the
holy
grail
little
he
recked
of
his
earldom
loss
no
more
on
his
surcoat
was
blazoned
the
cross
but
deep
in
his
soul
the
sign
he
wore
the
badge
of
the
suffering
and
the
poor
iii
sir
launfal
raiment
thin
and
spare
was
idle
mail
the
barbèd
air
for
it
was
just
at
the
christmas
time
so
he
mused
as
he
sat
of
a
sunnier
clime
and
sought
for
a
shelter
from
cold
and
snow
in
the
light
and
warmth
of
he
sees
the
caravan
crawl
the
edge
of
the
desert
black
and
small
then
nearer
and
nearer
till
one
by
one
he
can
count
the
camels
in
the
sun
as
over
the
sands
they
pass
to
where
in
its
slender
necklace
of
grass
the
little
spring
laughed
and
leapt
in
the
shade
and
with
its
own
self
like
an
infant
played
and
waved
its
signal
of
palms
iv
for
christ
sweet
sake
i
beg
an
alms
the
happy
camels
may
reach
the
spring
but
sir
launfal
sees
only
the
grewsome
thing
the
leper
lank
as
the
bone
that
cowers
beside
him
a
thing
as
lone
and
white
as
the
of
northern
seas
in
the
desolate
horror
of
his
disease
and
sir
launfal
said
i
behold
in
thee
an
image
of
him
who
died
on
the
tree
thou
also
hast
had
thy
crown
of
thorns
thou
also
hast
had
the
world
buffets
and
scorns
and
to
thy
life
were
not
denied
the
wounds
in
the
hands
and
feet
and
side
mild
mary
son
acknowledge
me
behold
through
him
i
give
to
thee
vi
then
the
soul
of
the
leper
stood
up
in
his
eyes
and
looked
at
sir
launfal
and
straightway
he
remembered
in
what
a
haughtier
guise
he
had
flung
an
alms
to
leprosie
when
he
girt
his
young
life
up
in
gilded
mail
and
set
forth
in
search
of
the
holy
grail
the
heart
within
him
was
ashes
and
dust
he
parted
in
twain
his
single
crust
he
broke
the
ice
on
the
streamlet
brink
and
gave
the
leper
to
eat
and
drink
was
a
mouldy
crust
of
coarse
brown
bread
was
water
out
of
a
wooden
bowl
yet
with
fine
wheaten
bread
was
the
leper
fed
and
was
red
wine
he
drank
with
his
thirsty
soul
vii
as
sir
launfal
mused
with
a
downcast
face
a
light
shone
round
about
the
place
the
leper
no
longer
crouched
at
his
side
but
stood
before
him
glorified
shining
and
tall
and
fair
and
straight
as
the
pillar
that
stood
by
the
beautiful
gate
himself
the
gate
whereby
men
can
enter
the
temple
of
god
in
man
viii
his
words
were
shed
softer
than
leaves
from
the
pine
and
they
fell
on
sir
launfal
as
snows
on
the
brine
which
mingle
their
softness
and
quiet
in
one
with
the
shaggy
unrest
they
float
down
upon
and
the
voice
that
was
calmer
than
silence
said
lo
it
is
i
be
not
afraid
in
many
climes
without
avail
thou
hast
spent
thy
life
for
the
holy
grail
behold
it
is
here
this
cup
which
thou
didst
fill
at
the
streamlet
for
me
but
now
this
crust
is
my
body
broken
for
thee
this
water
his
blood
that
died
on
the
tree
the
holy
supper
is
kept
indeed
in
whatso
we
share
with
another
need
not
what
we
give
but
what
we
share
for
the
gift
without
the
giver
is
bare
who
gives
himself
with
his
alms
feeds
three
himself
his
hungering
neighbor
and
me
ix
sir
launfal
awoke
as
from
a
swound
the
grail
in
my
castle
here
is
found
hang
my
idle
armor
up
on
the
wall
let
it
be
the
spider
banquet
hall
he
must
be
fenced
with
stronger
mail
who
would
seek
and
find
the
holy
grail
x
the
castle
gate
stands
open
now
and
the
wanderer
is
welcome
to
the
hall
as
the
hangbird
is
to
the
bough
no
longer
scowl
the
turrets
tall
the
summer
long
siege
at
last
is
when
the
first
poor
outcast
went
in
at
the
door
she
entered
with
him
in
disguise
and
mastered
the
fortress
by
surprise
there
is
no
spot
she
loves
so
well
on
ground
she
lingers
and
smiles
there
the
whole
year
round
the
meanest
serf
on
sir
launfal
land
has
hall
and
bower
at
his
command
and
there
no
poor
man
in
the
north
countree
but
is
lord
of
the
earldom
as
much
as
he
according
to
the
mythology
of
the
romancers
the
san
greal
or
holy
grail
was
the
cup
out
of
which
jesus
partook
of
the
last
supper
with
his
disciples
it
was
brought
into
england
by
joseph
of
arimathea
and
remained
there
an
object
of
pilgrimage
and
adoration
for
many
years
in
the
keeping
of
his
lineal
descendants
it
was
incumbent
upon
those
who
had
charge
of
it
to
be
chaste
in
thought
word
and
deed
but
one
of
the
keepers
having
broken
this
condition
the
holy
grail
disappeared
from
that
time
it
was
a
favorite
enterprise
of
the
knights
of
arthur
court
to
go
in
search
of
it
sir
galahad
was
at
last
successful
in
finding
it
as
we
may
read
in
the
seventeenth
book
of
the
romance
of
king
arthur
tennyson
has
made
sir
galahad
the
subject
of
one
of
the
most
exquisite
of
his
poems
the
plot
if
i
may
give
that
name
to
anything
so
slight
of
the
foregoing
poem
is
my
own
and
to
serve
its
purposes
i
have
enlarged
the
circle
of
competition
in
search
of
the
miraculous
cup
in
such
a
manner
as
to
include
not
only
other
persons
than
the
heroes
of
the
round
table
but
also
a
period
of
time
subsequent
to
the
date
of
king
reign
up
at
once
it
will
soon
be
too
late
and
buy
at
a
perfectly
ruinous
a
fable
for
critics
or
better
like
as
a
thing
that
the
reader
first
fancy
may
strike
an
such
as
presents
a
tabular
view
of
the
volume
a
glance
at
a
few
of
our
literary
progenies
malaprop
from
tub
of
diogenes
a
vocal
and
musical
medley
that
is
a
series
of
jokes
a
wonderful
accompanies
himself
with
a
full
of
spirit
and
grace
on
the
top
of
the
forth
in
october
the
day
in
the
year
putnam
it
being
the
commonest
mode
of
procedure
i
premise
a
few
candid
remarks
the
this
trifle
begun
to
please
only
myself
and
my
own
private
fancy
was
laid
on
the
shelf
but
some
friends
who
had
seen
it
induced
me
by
dint
of
saying
they
liked
it
to
put
it
in
print
that
is
having
come
to
that
very
conclusion
i
consulted
them
when
it
could
make
no
confusion
for
though
in
the
gentlest
of
ways
they
had
hinted
it
was
scarce
worth
the
while
i
should
doubtless
have
printed
it
i
began
it
intending
a
fable
a
frail
slender
thing
with
a
sting
in
its
tail
but
by
addings
and
alterings
not
previously
planned
digressions
like
birds
eggs
in
the
sand
and
dawdlings
to
suit
every
whimsy
demand
always
freeing
the
bird
which
i
held
in
my
hand
for
the
two
perched
perhaps
out
of
reach
in
the
tree
it
grew
by
degrees
to
the
size
which
you
see
i
was
like
the
old
woman
that
carried
the
calf
and
my
neighbors
like
hers
no
doubt
wonder
and
laugh
and
when
my
strained
arms
with
their
grown
burthen
full
i
call
it
my
fable
they
call
it
a
bull
having
scrawled
at
full
gallop
as
far
as
that
goes
in
a
style
that
is
neither
good
verse
nor
bad
prose
and
being
a
person
whom
nobody
knows
some
people
will
say
i
am
rather
more
free
with
my
readers
than
it
is
becoming
to
be
that
i
seem
to
expect
them
to
wait
on
my
leisure
in
following
wherever
i
wander
at
pleasure
that
in
short
i
take
more
than
a
young
author
lawful
ease
and
laugh
in
a
queer
way
so
like
mephistopheles
that
the
public
will
doubt
as
they
grope
through
my
rhythm
if
in
truth
i
am
making
fun
them
or
them
so
the
excellent
public
is
hereby
assured
that
the
sale
of
my
book
is
already
secured
for
there
is
not
a
poet
throughout
the
whole
land
but
will
purchase
a
copy
or
two
out
of
hand
in
the
fond
expectation
of
being
amused
in
it
by
seeing
his
betters
and
abused
in
it
now
i
find
by
a
pretty
exact
calculation
there
are
something
like
ten
thousand
bards
in
the
nation
of
that
special
variety
whom
the
review
and
magazine
critics
call
and
and
about
thirty
thousand
tribe
is
increasing
of
the
kinds
who
are
termed
of
and
the
public
will
see
by
a
glance
at
this
schedule
that
they
can
not
expect
me
to
be
about
courting
since
it
seems
i
have
got
enough
fuel
made
sure
of
for
boiling
my
pot
as
for
such
of
our
poets
as
find
not
their
names
mentioned
once
in
my
pages
with
praises
or
blames
let
them
in
their
without
further
to
my
friend
esquire
in
broadway
where
a
will
be
kept
with
the
strictest
regard
to
the
day
and
the
hour
of
receiving
the
card
then
taking
them
up
as
i
chance
to
have
time
that
is
if
their
names
can
be
twisted
in
rhyme
i
will
honestly
give
each
his
at
the
rate
of
to
each
thus
a
premium
is
offered
sufficiently
as
the
magazines
say
when
they
tell
their
best
lie
to
induce
bards
to
their
resources
and
buy
the
balance
of
every
edition
until
they
have
all
of
them
fairly
been
run
through
the
mill
one
word
to
such
readers
judicious
and
wise
as
read
books
with
something
behind
the
mere
eyes
of
whom
in
the
country
perhaps
there
are
two
including
myself
gentle
reader
and
you
all
the
characters
sketched
in
this
slight
though
it
may
be
they
seem
here
and
there
rather
free
and
drawn
from
a
mephistophelian
are
to
be
faithful
and
that
is
the
grand
point
and
none
but
an
owl
would
feel
sore
at
a
rub
from
a
jester
who
tells
you
without
any
subterfuge
that
he
sits
in
diogenes
tub
a
preliminary
note
to
the
second
edition
though
it
well
may
be
reckoned
of
all
composition
the
species
at
once
most
delightful
and
healthy
is
a
thing
which
an
author
unless
he
be
wealthy
and
willing
to
pay
for
that
kind
of
delight
is
not
in
all
instances
called
on
to
write
though
there
are
it
is
said
who
their
spirits
to
cheer
slip
in
a
new
three
times
a
year
and
in
this
way
snuff
up
an
imaginary
savor
of
that
sweetest
of
dishes
the
popular
favor
much
as
if
a
starved
painter
should
fall
to
and
treat
the
ugolino
inside
to
a
picture
of
meat
you
remember
if
not
pray
turn
over
and
look
that
in
writing
the
preface
which
ushered
my
book
i
treated
you
excellent
public
not
merely
with
a
cool
disregard
but
downright
cavalierly
now
i
would
not
take
back
the
least
thing
i
then
said
though
i
thereby
could
butter
both
sides
of
my
bread
for
i
never
could
see
that
an
author
owed
aught
to
the
people
he
solaced
diverted
or
taught
and
as
for
mere
fame
i
have
long
ago
learned
that
the
persons
by
whom
it
is
finally
earned
are
those
with
whom
verdict
weighed
not
a
pin
unsustained
by
the
higher
court
sitting
within
but
i
wander
from
what
i
intended
to
say
that
you
have
namely
shown
such
a
liberal
way
of
thinking
and
so
much
æsthetic
perception
of
anonymous
worth
in
the
handsome
reception
you
gave
to
my
book
spite
of
some
private
piques
having
bought
the
first
thousand
in
barely
two
weeks
that
i
think
past
a
doubt
if
you
measured
the
phiz
of
most
devotedly
wonderful
quiz
you
would
find
that
its
vertical
section
was
shorter
by
an
inch
and
two
tenths
or
that
and
a
quarter
you
have
watched
a
child
playing
in
those
wondrous
years
when
belief
is
not
bound
to
the
eyes
and
the
ears
and
the
vision
divine
is
so
clear
and
unmarred
that
each
baker
of
pies
in
the
dirt
is
a
bard
give
a
knife
and
a
shingle
he
fits
out
a
fleet
and
on
that
little
mud
puddle
over
the
street
his
invention
in
purest
good
faith
will
make
sail
round
the
globe
with
a
puff
of
his
breath
for
a
gale
will
visit
in
barely
ten
minutes
all
climes
and
find
northwestern
passages
hundreds
of
times
or
suppose
the
young
poet
fresh
stored
with
delights
from
that
bible
of
childhood
the
arabian
nights
he
will
turn
to
a
crony
and
cry
jack
let
play
that
i
am
a
genius
jacky
straightway
makes
aladdin
lamp
out
of
a
stone
and
for
hours
they
enjoy
each
his
own
supernatural
powers
this
is
all
very
pretty
and
pleasant
but
then
suppose
our
two
urchins
have
grown
into
men
and
both
have
turned
authors
one
says
to
his
brother
let
play
we
the
american
somethings
or
other
only
let
them
be
big
enough
no
matter
what
come
you
shall
be
goethe
or
pope
which
you
choose
i
be
coleridge
and
both
shall
write
mutual
reviews
so
they
both
as
mere
strangers
before
many
days
send
each
other
a
cord
of
anonymous
bays
each
in
piling
his
epithets
smiles
in
his
sleeve
to
see
what
his
friend
can
be
made
to
believe
each
in
reading
the
other
unbiased
review
thinks
here
pretty
high
praise
but
no
more
than
is
true
well
we
laugh
at
them
both
and
yet
make
no
great
fuss
when
the
same
farce
is
acted
to
benefit
us
even
i
who
if
asked
scarce
a
month
since
what
fudge
meant
should
have
answered
the
dear
public
critical
judgment
begin
to
think
sharpwitted
horace
spoke
sooth
when
he
said
that
the
public
hit
the
truth
in
reading
these
lines
you
perhaps
have
a
vision
of
a
person
in
pretty
good
health
and
condition
and
yet
since
i
put
forth
my
primary
edition
i
have
been
crushed
scorched
withered
used
up
and
put
down
by
smith
with
the
cordial
assistance
of

if
you
put
any
faith
in
my
rhymes
to
the
number
of
several
times
and
while
i
am
writing
i
tremble
to
think
of
it
for
i
may
at
this
moment
be
just
on
the
brink
of
it
molybdostom
angry
at
being

the
wise
scandinavians
probably
called
their
bards
by
the
title
of

a
delicate
way
as
it
were
just
to
hint
to
the
world
the
hot
water
they
always
get
into
now
i
shall
not
crush
since
indeed
for
that
matter
no
pressure
i
know
of
could
render
them
flatter
nor
wither
nor
scorch
them
no
action
of
fire
could
make
either
them
or
their

drier
nor
waste
time
in
putting
them
down
i
am
thinking
not
their

will
keep
them
from
sinking

contradiction
about
the

without

heavy

draw
out

feel
nothing
more
than
a
sorrow
to
think
that
they
all
will
be
lying
tossed
carelessly
up
on
the
shelves

forgotten
by
all

their

no

these
are
all
my
kind
neighbors
and
leave
me
no
wish
to
say
aught
to
you
all
my
poor
critics
but
pish
i
have
buried
the
hatchet
i
am
twisting
an
allumette
out
of
one
of
you
now
and
relighting
my
calumet
in
your
private
capacities
come
when
you
please
i
will
give
you
my
hand
and
a
fresh
pipe
as
i
ran
through
the
leaves
of
my
poor
little
book
to
take
a
fond
author
first
tremulous
look
it
was
quite
an
excitement
to
hunt
the
sprawled
in
as
birds
tracks
are
in
some
kinds
of
strata
only
these
made
things
crookeder
fancy
an
heir
that
a
father
had
seen
born
and
fair
turning
suddenly
from
a
pride
become
an
aversion
my
case
was
yet
worse
a
by
way
of
a
change
in
a
verse
i
might
have
forgiven
an
being
wry
a
limp
in
an
or
a
cock
in
an
but
to
have
the
sweet
babe
of
my
brain
served
in
i
am
not
but
such
a
thyestean
banquet
as
that
was
quite
out
of
the
question
in
the
edition
now
issued
no
pains
are
neglected
and
my
verses
as
orators
say
stand
corrected
yet
some
blunders
remain
of
the
own
make
which
i
wish
to
correct
for
my
personal
sake
for
instance
a
character
drawn
in
pure
fun
and
condensing
the
traits
of
a
dozen
in
one
has
been
as
i
hear
by
some
persons
applied
to
a
good
friend
of
mine
whom
to
stab
in
the
side
as
we
walked
along
chatting
and
joking
together
would
not
be
way
i
can
hardly
tell
whether
a
question
will
ever
arise
in
which
he
and
i
should
by
any
strange
fortune
agree
but
meanwhile
my
esteem
for
him
grows
as
i
know
him
and
though
not
the
best
judge
upon
earth
of
a
poem
he
knows
what
it
is
he
is
saying
and
why
and
is
honest
and
fearless
two
good
points
which
i
have
not
found
so
rife
i
can
easily
smother
my
love
for
them
whether
on
my
side
or
for
my
other
you
may
be
sure
that
i
know
what
is
meant
by
a
caricature
and
what
by
a
portrait
there
are
those
who
think
it
is
capital
fun
to
be
spattering
their
ink
on
quiet
unquarrelsome
folk
but
the
minute
the
game
changes
sides
and
the
others
begin
it
they
see
something
savage
and
horrible
in
it
as
for
me
i
respect
neither
women
nor
men
for
their
gender
nor
own
any
sex
in
a
pen
i
choose
just
to
hint
to
some
causeless
unfriends
that
as
far
as
i
know
there
are
always
two
ends
and
one
of
them
heaviest
too
to
a
staff
and
two
parties
also
to
every
good
laugh
a
fable
for
critics
phœbus
sitting
one
day
in
a
shade
was
reminded
of
daphne
of
whom
it
was
made
for
the
god
being
one
day
too
warm
in
his
wooing
she
took
to
the
tree
to
escape
his
pursuing
be
the
cause
what
it
might
from
his
offers
she
shrunk
and
shut
herself
up
in
a
trunk
and
though
was
a
step
into
which
he
had
driven
her
he
somehow
or
other
had
never
forgiven
her
her
memory
he
nursed
as
a
kind
of
a
tonic
something
bitter
to
chew
when
he
play
the
byronic
and
i
ca
count
the
obstinate
nymphs
that
he
brought
over
by
a
strange
kind
of
smile
he
put
on
when
he
thought
of
her
my
case
is
like
dido
he
sometimes
remark
when
i
last
saw
my
love
she
was
fairly
embark
in
a
laurel
as
thought
but
ah
how
fate
mocks
she
has
found
it
by
this
time
a
very
bad
box
let
hunters
from
me
take
this
saw
when
they
need
it
you
not
always
sure
of
your
game
when
you
treed
it
just
conceive
such
a
change
taking
place
in
one
mistress
what
romance
would
be
left
who
can
flatter
or
kiss
trees
and
for
mercy
sake
how
could
one
keep
up
a
dialogue
with
a
dull
wooden
thing
that
will
live
and
will
die
a
log
not
to
say
that
the
thought
would
forever
intrude
that
you
less
chance
to
win
her
the
more
she
is
wood
ah
it
went
to
my
heart
and
the
memory
still
grieves
to
see
those
loved
graces
all
taking
their
leaves
those
charms
beyond
speech
so
enchanting
but
now
as
they
left
me
forever
each
making
its
bough
if
her
tongue
a
tang
sometimes
more
than
was
right
her
new
bark
is
worse
than
ten
times
her
old
bite
now
daphne
before
she
was
happily
treeified
over
all
other
blossoms
the
lily
had
deified
and
when
she
expected
the
god
on
a
visit
was
before
he
had
made
his
intentions
explicit
some
buds
she
arranged
with
a
vast
deal
of
care
to
look
as
if
artlessly
twined
in
her
hair
where
they
seemed
as
he
said
when
he
paid
his
addresses
like
the
day
breaking
through
the
long
night
of
her
tresses
so
whenever
he
wished
to
be
quite
irresistible
like
a
man
with
eight
trumps
in
his
hand
at
a
i
feared
me
at
first
that
the
rhyme
was
untwistable
though
i
might
have
lugged
in
an
allusion
to
cristabel
he
would
take
up
a
lily
and
gloomily
look
in
it
as
i
shall
at
the
when
they
cut
up
my
book
in
it
well
here
after
all
the
bad
rhyme
i
been
spinning
i
got
back
at
last
to
my
story
beginning
sitting
there
as
i
say
in
the
shade
of
his
mistress
as
dull
as
a
volume
of
old
chester
mysteries
or
as
those
puzzling
specimens
which
in
old
histories
we
read
of
his
verses
the
oracles
namely
i
wonder
the
greeks
should
have
swallowed
them
tamely
for
one
might
bet
safely
whatever
he
has
to
risk
they
were
laid
at
his
door
by
some
ancient
miss
asterisk
and
so
dull
that
the
men
who
retailed
them
got
the
ill
name
of
augurs
because
they
were
bores
first
he
mused
what
the
animal
substance
or
herb
is
would
induce
a
moustache
for
you
know
he
then
he
shuddered
to
think
how
his
youthful
position
was
assailed
by
the
age
of
his
son
the
physician
at
some
poems
he
glanced
had
been
sent
to
him
lately
and
the
metre
and
sentiment
puzzled
him
greatly
mehercle
i
make
such
proceedings
felonious
have
they
all
of
them
slept
in
the
cave
of
trophonius
look
well
to
your
seat
is
like
taking
an
airing
on
a
corduroy
road
and
that
out
of
repairing
it
leads
one
is
true
through
the
primitive
forest
grand
natural
features
but
then
one
has
no
rest
you
just
catch
a
glimpse
of
some
ravishing
distance
when
a
jolt
puts
the
whole
of
it
out
of
existence
why
not
use
their
ears
if
they
happen
to
have
any
here
the
murmured
the
name
of
poor
daphne
o
weep
with
me
daphne
he
sighed
for
you
know
a
terrible
thing
to
be
pestered
with
poets
but
alas
she
is
dumb
and
the
proverb
holds
good
she
never
will
cry
till
she
out
of
the
wood
what
would
i
give
if
i
never
had
known
of
her
a
kind
of
relief
had
i
something
to
groan
over
if
i
had
but
some
letters
of
hers
now
to
toss
over
i
might
turn
for
the
nonce
a
byronic
philosopher
and
bewitch
all
the
flats
by
bemoaning
the
loss
of
her
one
needs
something
tangible
though
to
begin
on
a
loom
as
it
were
for
the
fancy
to
spin
on
what
boots
all
your
grist
it
can
never
be
ground
till
a
breeze
makes
the
arms
of
the
windmill
go
round
or
if
is
a
alter
the
metaphor
and
say
it
wo
stir
save
the
wheel
be
well
wet
afore
or
lug
in
some
stuff
about
water
dreamily
it
is
not
a
metaphor
though
is
a
simile
a
lily
perhaps
would
set
mill
agoing
for
just
at
this
season
i
think
they
are
blowing
here
somebody
fetch
one
not
very
far
hence
they
in
bloom
by
the
score
is
but
climbing
a
fence
there
a
poet
hard
by
who
does
nothing
but
fill
his
whole
garden
from
one
end
to
with
lilies
a
very
good
plan
were
it
not
for
satiety
one
longs
for
a
weed
here
and
there
for
variety
though
a
weed
is
no
more
than
a
flower
in
disguise
which
is
seen
through
at
once
if
love
give
a
man
eyes
now
there
happened
to
be
among
phœbus
followers
a
gentleman
one
of
the
omnivorous
swallowers
who
bolt
every
book
that
comes
out
of
the
press
without
the
least
question
of
larger
or
less
whose
stomachs
are
strong
at
the
expense
of
their
head
for
reading
new
books
is
like
eating
new
bread
one
can
bear
it
at
first
but
by
gradual
steps
he
is
brought
to
death
door
of
a
mental
dyspepsy
on
a
previous
stage
of
existence
our
hero
had
ridden
outside
with
the
glass
below
zero
he
had
been
is
a
fact
you
may
safely
rely
on
of
a
very
old
stock
a
most
eminent
scion
a
stock
all
fresh
quacks
their
fierce
boluses
ply
on
who
stretch
the
new
boots
earth
unwilling
to
try
on
whom
humbugs
of
all
shapes
and
sorts
keep
their
eye
on
whose
hair
in
the
mortar
of
every
new
zion
who
when
whistles
are
dear
go
directly
and
buy
one
who
think
slavery
a
crime
that
we
must
not
say
fie
on
who
hunt
if
they
hunt
at
all
with
the
lion
though
they
hunt
lions
also
whenever
they
spy
one
who
contrive
to
make
every
good
fortune
a
wry
one
and
at
last
choose
the
hard
bed
of
honor
to
die
on
whose
pedigree
traced
to
earth
earliest
years
is
longer
than
anything
else
but
their
ears
in
short
he
was
sent
into
life
with
the
wrong
key
he
unlocked
the
door
and
stept
forth
a
poor
donkey
though
kicked
and
abused
by
his
bipedal
betters
yet
he
filled
no
mean
place
in
the
kingdom
of
letters
far
happier
than
many
a
literary
hack
he
bore
only
rags
on
his
back
for
it
makes
a
vast
difference
which
side
the
mill
one
expends
on
the
paper
his
labor
and
skill
so
when
his
soul
waited
a
new
transmigration
and
destiny
balanced
this
and
that
station
not
having
much
time
to
expend
upon
bothers
remembering
he
had
some
connection
with
authors
and
considering
his
four
legs
had
grown
paralytic
she
set
him
on
two
and
he
came
forth
a
critic
through
his
babyhood
no
kind
of
pleasure
he
took
in
any
amusement
but
tearing
a
book
for
him
there
was
no
intermediate
stage
from
babyhood
up
to
middle
age
there
were
years
when
he
did
wear
behind
but
a
boy
he
could
never
be
rightly
defined
like
the
irish
good
folk
though
in
length
scarce
a
span
from
the

he
came
gravely
a
little
old
man
while
other
boys
trousers
demanded
the
toil
of
the
motherly
fingers
on
all
kinds
of
soil
red
yellow
brown
black
clayey
gravelly
loamy
he
sat
in
the
corner
and
read
viri
romæ
he
never
was
known
to
unbend
or
to
revel
once
in
base
marbles
hockey
or
kick
up
the
devil
once
he
was
just
one
of
those
who
excite
the
benevolence
of
your
old
prigs
who
sound
the
soul
depths
with
a
ledger
and
are
on
the
lookout
for
some
young
men
to
edger
cate
as
they
call
it
who
wo
be
too
costly
and
who
afterward
take
to
the
ministry
mostly
who
always
wear
spectacles
always
look
bilious
always
keep
on
good
terms
with
each
throughout
the
whole
parish
and
manage
to
rear
ten
boys
like
themselves
on
four
hundred
a
year
who
fulfilling
in
turn
the
same
fearful
conditions
either
preach
through
their
noses
or
go
upon
missions
in
this
way
our
hero
got
safely
to
college
where
he
bolted
alike
both
his
commons
and
knowledge
a
always
wound
up
and
going
he
mastered
whatever
was
not
worth
the
knowing
appeared
in
a
gown
and
a
vest
of
black
satin
to
spout
such
a
gothic
oration
in
latin
that
tully
could
never
have
made
out
a
word
in
it
though
himself
was
the
model
the
author
preferred
in
it
and
grasping
the
parchment
which
gave
him
in
fee
all
the
mystic
contained
in
a
he
was
launched
life
is
always
compared
to
a
sea
with
just
enough
learning
and
skill
for
the
using
it
to
prove
he
a
brain
by
forever
confusing
it
so
worthy
saint
benedict
piously
burning
with
the
holiest
zeal
against
secular
learning
as
writers
express
it
sapienter
â
româ
be
endless
to
tell
you
the
things
that
he
knew
all
separate
facts
undeniably
true
but
with
him
or
each
other
they
nothing
to
do
no
power
of
combining
arranging
discerning
digested
the
masses
he
learned
into
learning
there
was
one
thing
in
life
he
had
practical
knowledge
for
and
this
you
will
think
he
need
scarce
go
to
college
for
not
a
deed
would
he
do
nor
a
word
would
he
utter
till
he
weighed
its
relations
to
plain
bread
and
butter
when
he
left
alma
mater
he
practised
his
wits
in
compiling
the
journals
historical
bits
of
shops
broken
open
men
falling
in
fits
great
fortunes
in
england
bequeathed
to
poor
printers
and
cold
spells
the
coldest
for
many
past
winters
then
rising
by
industry
knack
and
address
got
notices
up
for
an
unbiassed
press
with
a
mind
so
wellpoised
it
seemed
equally
made
for
applause
or
abuse
just
which
chanced
to
be
paid
for
from
this
point
his
progress
was
rapid
and
sure
to
the
post
of
a
regular
heavy
reviewer
and
here
i
must
say
he
wrote
excellent
articles
on
the
hebraic
points
or
the
force
of
greek
particles
they
filled
up
the
space
nothing
else
was
prepared
for
and
nobody
read
that
which
nobody
cared
for
if
any
old
book
reached
a
fiftieth
edition
he
could
fill
forty
pages
with
safe
erudition
he
could
gauge
the
old
books
by
the
old
set
of
rules
and
his
very
old
nothings
pleased
very
old
fools
but
give
him
a
new
book
fresh
out
of
the
heart
and
you
put
him
at
sea
without
compass
or
chart
his
blunders
aspired
to
the
rank
of
an
art
for
his
lore
was
engraft
something
foreign
that
grew
in
him
exhausting
the
sap
of
the
native
and
true
in
him
so
that
when
a
man
came
with
a
soul
that
was
new
in
him
carving
new
forms
of
truth
out
of
nature
old
granite
new
and
old
at
their
birth
like
le
verrier
planet
which
to
get
a
true
judgment
themselves
must
create
in
the
soul
of
their
critic
the
measure
and
weight
being
rather
themselves
a
fresh
standard
of
grace
to
compute
their
own
judge
and
assign
him
his
place
our
reviewer
would
crawl
all
about
it
and
round
it
and
reporting
each
circumstance
just
as
he
found
it
without
the
least
malice
his
record
would
be
profoundly
æsthetic
as
that
of
a
flea
which
supping
on
wordsworth
should
print
for
our
sakes
recollections
of
nights
with
the
bard
of
the
lakes
or
borne
by
an
arab
guide
ventured
to
render
a
general
view
of
the
ruins
of
denderah
as
i
said
he
was
never
precisely
unkind
the
defect
in
his
brain
was
just
absence
of
mind
if
he
boasted
was
simply
that
he
was
a
position
which
i
for
one
never
gainsaid
my
respect
for
my
maker
supposing
a
skill
in
his
works
which
our
hero
would
answer
but
ill
and
i
trust
that
the
mould
which
he
used
may
be
cracked
or
he
made
bold
by
success
may
enlarge
his
phylactery
and
set
up
a
kind
of
a
an
event
which
i
shudder
to
think
about
seeing
that
man
is
a
moral
accountable
being
he
meant
well
enough
but
was
still
in
the
way
as
a
dunce
always
is
let
him
be
where
he
may
indeed
they
appear
to
come
into
existence
to
impede
other
folks
with
their
awkward
assistance
if
you
set
up
a
dunce
on
the
very
north
pole
all
alone
with
himself
i
believe
on
my
soul
he
manage
to
get
betwixt
somebody
shins
and
pitch
him
down
bodily
all
in
his
sins
to
the
grave
polar
bears
sitting
round
on
the
ice
all
shortening
their
grace
to
be
in
for
a
slice
or
if
he
found
nobody
else
there
to
pother
why
one
of
his
legs
would
just
trip
up
the
other
for
there
nothing
we
read
of
in
torture
inventions
like
a
dunce
with
the
best
of
intentions
a
terrible
fellow
to
meet
in
society
not
the
toast
that
he
buttered
was
ever
so
dry
at
tea
there
he
sit
at
the
table
and
stir
in
his
sugar
crouching
close
for
a
spring
all
the
while
like
a
cougar
be
sure
of
your
facts
of
your
measures
and
weights
of
your
time
he
as
fond
as
an
arab
of
dates
you
be
telling
perhaps
in
your
comical
way
of
something
you
seen
in
the
course
of
the
day
and
just
as
you
tapering
out
the
conclusion
you
venture
an
classic
allusion
the
girls
have
all
got
their
laughs
ready
when
whack
the
cougar
comes
down
on
your
thunderstruck
back
you
had
left
out
a
comma
your
greek
put
in
joint
and
pointed
at
cost
of
your
story
whole
point
in
the
course
of
the
evening
you
venture
on
certain
soft
speeches
to
anne
in
the
shade
of
the
curtain
you
tell
her
your
heart
can
be
likened
to
one
flower
and
that
oh
most
charming
of
women
the
sunflower
which
turns
here
a
clear
nasal
voice
to
your
terror
from
outside
the
curtain
says
that
all
an
error
as
for
him
he
no
matter
he
never
grew
tender
sitting
after
a
ball
with
his
feet
on
the
fender
shaping
somebody
sweet
features
out
of
cigar
smoke
though
he
willingly
grant
you
that
such
doings
are
smoke
all
women
he
damns
with
and
if
ever
he
felt
something
like
love
distemper
was
towards
a
young
lady
who
spoke
ancient
mexican
and
assisted
her
father
in
making
a
lexicon
though
i
recollect
hearing
him
get
quite
ferocious
about
mary
clausum
the
mistress
of
grotius
or
something
of
that
sort
but
no
more
to
bore
ye
with
i
turn
to
my
story
now
apollo
who
finds
it
convenient
sometimes
to
get
his
court
clear
of
the
makers
of
rhymes
the
i
think
it
is
called
every
one
of
whom
thinks
himself
treated
most
shabbily
and
nurses
a
what
is
it
which
keeps
him
at
hot
for
a
quarrel
as
bitter
as
wormwood
and
sourer
than
sorrel
if
any
poor
devil
but
look
at
a
laurel
apollo
i
say
being
sick
of
their
rioting
though
he
sometimes
acknowledged
their
verse
had
a
quieting
effect
after
dinner
and
seemed
to
suggest
a
retreat
to
the
shrine
of
a
tranquil
siesta
kept
our
hero
at
hand
who
by
means
of
a
bray
which
he
gave
to
the
life
drove
the
rabble
away
and
if
that
would
do
he
was
sure
to
succeed
if
he
took
his
review
out
and
offered
to
read
or
failing
in
plans
of
this
milder
description
he
would
ask
for
their
aid
to
get
up
a
subscription
considering
that
authorship
was
a
rich
craft
to
print
the
american
drama
of
witchcraft
stay
i
read
you
a
scene
but
he
hardly
began
ere
apollo
shrieked
help
and
the
authors
all
ran
and
once
when
these
purgatives
acted
with
less
spirit
and
the
desperate
case
asked
a
remedy
desperate
he
drew
from
his
pocket
a
foolscap
epistle
as
calmly
as
if
a
pistol
and
threatened
them
all
with
the
judgment
to
come
of
a
wandering
star
first
impressions
of
rome
stop
stop
with
their
hands
their
ears
screamed
the
muses
he
may
go
off
and
murder
himself
if
he
chooses
was
a
means
only
sanctioned
his
trying
is
mere
massacre
now
that
the
enemy
flying
if
he
forced
to
again
and
we
happen
to
be
there
give
us
each
a
large
handkerchief
soaked
in
strong
ether
i
call
this
a
fable
for
critics
you
think
more
like
a
display
of
my
rhythmical
trinkets
my
plot
like
an
icicle
slender
and
slippery
every
moment
more
slender
and
likely
to
slip
awry
and
the
reader
unwilling
loco
is
free
to
jump
over
as
much
of
my
frippery
as
he
fancies
and
if
he
a
provident
skipper
he
may
have
an
odyssean
sway
of
the
gales
and
get
safe
into
port
ere
his
patience
all
fails
moreover
although
is
a
slender
return
for
your
toil
and
expense
yet
my
paper
will
burn
and
if
you
have
manfully
struggled
thus
far
with
me
you
may
twist
me
up
and
just
light
your
cigar
with
me
if
too
angry
for
that
you
can
tear
me
in
pieces
and
my
consign
to
the
breezes
a
fate
like
great
ratzau
whom
one
of
those
bores
who
beflead
with
bad
verses
poor
louis
quatorze
describes
the
first
verse
somehow
ends
with
as
partout
et
ses
membres
et
sa
or
if
i
were
of
earning
a
repute
among
noodles
for
classical
learning
i
could
pick
you
a
score
of
allusions
i
wis
as
new
as
the
jests
of
better
still
i
could
make
out
a
good
solid
list
from
recondite
authors
who
do
not
exist
but
that
would
be
naughty
at
least
i
could
twist
something
out
of
absyrtus
or
turn
your
inquiries
after
milton
prose
metaphor
drawn
from
osiris
but
as
cicero
says
he
wo
say
this
or
that
a
fetch
i
must
say
most
transparent
and
flat
after
saying
he
could
possibly
think
of
i
simply
will
state
that
i
pause
on
the
brink
of
a
mire
of
deliberate
confusion
made
up
of
old
jumbles
of
classic
allusion
so
when
you
were
thinking
yourselves
to
be
pitied
just
conceive
how
much
harder
your
teeth
you
have
gritted
an
were
not
for
the
dulness
i
kindly
omitted
i
apologize
here
for
my
many
digressions
were
it
not
that
i
certain
to
trip
into
fresh
ones
is
so
hard
to
escape
if
you
get
in
their
mesh
once
just
reflect
if
you
please
how
is
said
by
horatius
that
mæonides
nods
now
and
then
and
my
gracious
it
certainly
does
look
a
little
bit
ominous
when
he
gets
under
way
with
here
a
something
occurs
which
i
just
clap
a
rhyme
to
and
say
it
myself
ere
a
zoilus
have
time
to
any
author
a
nap
like
van
winkle
may
take
if
he
only
contrive
to
keep
readers
awake
but
he
very
soon
find
himself
laid
on
the
shelf
if
fall
a
nodding
when
he
nods
himself
once
for
all
to
return
and
to
stay
will
i
nill
i
when
phœbus
expressed
his
desire
for
a
lily
our
hero
whose
homœopathic
sagacity
with
an
ocean
of
zeal
mixed
his
drop
of
capacity
set
off
for
the
garden
as
fast
as
the
wind
or
to
take
a
comparison
more
to
my
mind
as
a
sound
politician
leaves
conscience
behind
and
leaped
the
low
fence
as
a
party
hack
jumps
his
principles
when
something
else
turns
up
trumps
he
was
gone
a
long
time
and
apollo
meanwhile
went
over
some
sonnets
of
his
with
a
file
for
of
all
compositions
he
thought
that
the
sonnet
best
repaid
all
the
toil
you
expended
upon
it
it
should
reach
with
one
impulse
the
end
of
its
course
and
for
one
final
blow
collect
all
of
its
force
not
a
verse
should
be
salient
but
each
one
should
tend
with
a
to
burst
at
the
end
so
condensing
the
strength
here
there
smoothing
a
wry
kink
he
was
killing
the
time
when
up
walked
at
a
few
steps
behind
him
a
small
man
in
glasses
went
dodging
about
muttering
murderers
asses
from
out
of
his
pocket
a
paper
he
take
with
the
proud
look
of
martyrdom
tied
to
its
stake
and
reading
a
squib
at
himself
he
say
here
i
see
american
letters
a
bloody
conspiracy
they
are
all
by
my
personal
enemies
written
i
must
post
an
anonymous
letter
to
britain
and
show
that
this
gall
is
the
merest
suggestion
of
spite
at
my
zeal
on
the
copyright
question
for
on
this
side
the
water
is
prudent
to
pull
the
eyes
of
the
public
their
national
wool
by
accusing
of
slavish
respect
to
john
bull
all
american
authors
who
have
more
or
less
of
that
humbug
success
while
in
private
we
always
embracing
the
knees
of
some
twopenny
editor
over
the
seas
and
licking
his
critical
shoes
for
you
know
is
the
whole
aim
of
our
lives
to
get
one
english
notice
my
american
puffs
i
would
willingly
burn
all
they
all
from
one
source
monthly
weekly
diurnal
to
get
but
a
kick
from
a
transmarine
journal
so
culling
the
gibes
of
each
critical
scorner
as
if
they
were
plums
and
himself
were
jack
horner
he
came
cautiously
on
peeping
round
every
corner
and
into
each
hole
where
a
weasel
might
pass
in
expecting
the
knife
of
some
critic
assassin
who
stabs
to
the
heart
with
a
caricature
not
so
bad
as
those
daubs
of
the
sun
to
be
sure
yet
done
with
a
whose
vile
portraits
disperse
all
one
good
and
condense
all
one
poor
traits
apollo
looked
up
hearing
footsteps
approaching
and
slipped
out
of
sight
the
new
rhymes
he
was
broaching
good
day
i
happy
to
meet
with
a
scholar
so
ripe
and
a
critic
so
neat
who
through
the
soul
of
a
gentleman
carries
what
news
from
that
suburb
of
london
and
paris
which
latterly
makes
such
shrill
claims
to
monopolize
the
credit
of
being
the
new
world
metropolis
why
nothing
of
consequence
save
this
attack
on
my
friend
there
behind
by
some
pitiful
hack
who
thinks
every
national
author
a
poor
one
that
is
a
copy
of
something
that
foreign
and
assaults
the
american
dick
nay
is
clear
that
your
damon
there
fond
of
a
flea
in
his
ear
and
if
no
one
else
furnished
them
gratis
on
tick
he
would
buy
some
himself
just
to
hear
the
old
click
why
i
honestly
think
if
some
fool
in
japan
should
turn
up
his
nose
at
the
on
man
your
friend
there
by
some
inward
instinct
would
know
it
would
get
it
translated
reprinted
and
show
it
as
a
man
might
take
off
a
high
stock
to
exhibit
the
autograph
round
his
own
neck
of
the
gibbet
nor
would
let
it
rest
so
but
fire
column
after
column
signed
cato
or
brutus
or
something
as
solemn
by
way
of
displaying
his
critical
crosses
and
tweaking
that
poor
transatlantic
proboscis
his
broadsides
resulting
and
this
there
no
doubt
of
in
successively
sinking
the
craft
they
fired
out
of
now
nobody
knows
when
an
author
is
hit
if
he
do
have
a
public
hysterical
fit
let
him
only
keep
close
in
his
snug
garret
dim
ether
and
nobody
think
of
his
critics
or
him
either
if
an
author
have
any
least
fibre
of
worth
in
him
abuse
would
but
tickle
the
organ
of
mirth
in
him
all
the
critics
on
earth
can
not
crush
with
their
ban
one
word
that
in
tune
with
the
nature
of
man
well
perhaps
so
meanwhile
i
have
brought
you
a
book
into
which
if
you
just
have
the
goodness
to
look
you
may
feel
so
delighted
when
you
have
got
through
it
as
to
think
it
not
unworth
your
while
to
review
it
and
i
think
i
can
promise
your
thoughts
if
you
do
a
place
in
the
next
democratic
review
the
most
thankless
of
gods
you
must
surely
have
thought
me
for
this
is
the
copy
you
brought
me
i
have
given
them
away
or
at
least
i
have
tried
but
i
left
standing
all
side
by
side
the
man
who
accepted
that
one
copy
died
from
one
end
of
a
shelf
to
the
other
they
reach
the
author
respects
neatly
written
in
each
the
publisher
sure
will
proclaim
a
te
deum
when
he
hears
of
that
order
the
british
museum
has
sent
for
one
set
of
what
books
were
first
printed
in
america
little
or
big
for
is
hinted
that
this
is
the
first
truly
tangible
hope
he
has
ever
had
raised
for
the
sale
of
a
copy
i
thought
very
often
would
be
a
good
thing
in
all
public
collections
of
books
if
a
wing
were
set
off
by
itself
like
the
seas
from
the
dry
lands
marked
suited
to
desolate
and
filled
with
such
books
as
could
never
be
read
save
by
readers
of
proofs
forced
to
do
it
for
bread
such
books
as
one
wrecked
on
in
small
such
as
hermits
might
mortify
over
in
caverns
such
as
satan
if
printing
had
then
been
invented
as
the
climax
of
woe
would
to
job
have
presented
such
as
crusoe
might
dip
in
although
there
are
few
so
outrageously
cornered
by
fate
as
poor
crusoe
and
since
the
philanthropists
just
now
are
banging
and
gibbeting
all
who
in
favor
of
hanging
though
cheever
has
proved
that
the
bible
and
altar
were
let
down
from
heaven
at
the
end
of
a
halter
and
that
vital
religion
would
dull
and
grow
callous
unrefreshed
now
and
then
with
a
sniff
of
the
gallows
and
folks
are
beginning
to
think
it
looks
odd
to
choke
a
poor
scamp
for
the
glory
of
god
and
that
he
who
esteems
the
virginia
reel
a
bait
to
draw
saints
from
their
spiritual
weal
and
regards
the
quadrille
as
a
far
greater
knavery
than
crushing
his
african
children
with
slavery
since
all
who
take
part
in
a
waltz
or
cotillion
are
mounted
for
hell
on
the
devil
own
pillion
who
as
every
true
orthodox
christian
well
knows
approaches
the
heart
through
the
door
of
the
toes
that
he
i
was
saying
whose
judgments
are
stored
for
such
as
take
steps
in
despite
of
his
word
should
look
with
delight
on
the
agonized
prancing
of
a
wretch
who
has
not
the
least
ground
for
his
dancing
while
the
state
standing
by
sings
a
verse
from
the
psalter
about
offering
to
god
on
his
favorite
halter
and
when
the
legs
droop
from
their
twitching
divergence
sells
the
clothes
to
a
jew
and
the
corpse
to
the
surgeons
now
instead
of
all
this
i
think
i
can
direct
you
all
to
a
criminal
code
both
humane
and
effectual
i
propose
to
shut
up
every
doer
of
wrong
with
these
desperate
books
for
such
term
short
or
long
as
by
statute
in
such
cases
made
and
provided
shall
be
by
your
wise
legislators
decided
thus
let
murderers
be
shut
to
grow
wiser
and
cooler
at
hard
labor
for
life
on
the
works
of
miss
petty
thieves
kept
from
flagranter
crimes
by
their
fears
shall
peruse
yankee
doodle
a
blank
term
of
years
that
american
punch
like
the
english
no
doubt
just
the
sugar
and
lemons
and
spirit
left
out
but
stay
here
comes
tityrus
griswold
and
leads
on
the
flocks
whom
he
first
plucks
alive
and
then
feeds
on
a
swarm
in
whose
feathers
he
goes
for
as
perfect
a
swan
as
the
rest
there
comes
emerson
first
whose
rich
words
every
one
are
like
gold
nails
in
temples
to
hang
trophies
on
whose
prose
is
grand
verse
while
his
verse
the
lord
knows
is
some
of
it
pr
no
is
not
even
prose
i
speaking
of
metres
some
poems
have
welled
from
those
rare
depths
of
soul
that
have
been
excelled
they
not
epics
but
that
does
matter
a
pin
in
creating
the
only
hard
thing
to
begin
a
no
easier
to
make
than
an
oak
if
you
once
found
the
way
you
achieved
the
grand
stroke
in
the
worst
of
his
poems
are
mines
of
rich
matter
but
thrown
in
a
heap
with
a
crash
and
a
clatter
now
it
is
not
one
thing
nor
another
alone
makes
a
poem
but
rather
the
general
tone
the
something
pervading
uniting
the
whole
the
before
unconceived
unconceivable
soul
so
that
just
in
removing
this
trifle
or
that
you
take
away
as
it
were
a
chief
limb
of
the
statue
roots
wood
bark
and
leaves
singly
perfect
may
be
but
clapt
together
they
do
make
a
tree
but
to
come
back
to
emerson
whom
by
the
way
i
believe
we
left
waiting
his
is
we
may
say
a
greek
head
on
right
yankee
shoulders
whose
range
has
olympus
for
one
pole
for
the
exchange
he
seems
to
my
thinking
although
i
afraid
the
comparison
must
long
ere
this
have
been
made
a
where
the
egyptian
gold
mist
and
the
gascon
shrewd
wit
coexist
all
admire
and
yet
scarcely
six
converts
he
got
to
i
do
nor
they
either
exactly
know
what
for
though
he
builds
glorious
temples
is
odd
he
leaves
never
a
doorway
to
get
in
a
god
is
refreshing
to
people
like
me
to
meet
such
a
primitive
pagan
as
he
in
whose
mind
all
creation
is
duly
respected
as
parts
of
himself
just
a
little
projected
and
who
willing
to
worship
the
stars
and
the
sun
a
convert
to
nothing
but
emerson
so
perfect
a
balance
there
is
in
his
head
that
he
talks
of
things
sometimes
as
if
they
were
dead
life
nature
love
god
and
affairs
of
that
sort
he
looks
at
as
merely
ideas
in
short
as
if
they
were
fossils
stuck
round
in
a
cabinet
of
such
vast
extent
that
our
earth
a
mere
dab
in
it
composed
just
as
he
is
inclined
to
conjecture
her
namely
one
part
pure
earth
parts
pure
lecturer
you
are
filled
with
delight
at
his
clear
demonstration
each
figure
word
gesture
just
fits
the
occasion
with
the
quiet
precision
of
science
he
sort
but
you
ca
help
suspecting
the
whole
a
there
are
persons
to
the
soul
make
and
style
who
insist
on
a
likeness
him
and
carlyle
to
compare
him
with
plato
would
be
vastly
fairer
carlyle
the
more
burly
but
is
the
rarer
he
sees
fewer
objects
but
clearlier
truelier
if
as
original
more
peculiar
that
he
more
of
a
man
you
might
say
of
the
one
of
the
other
he
more
of
an
emerson
the
titan
as
shaggy
of
mind
as
of
limb
the
olympian
rapid
and
slim
the
one
norseman
the
other
half
greek
where
the
one
most
abounding
the
other
to
seek
generals
require
to
be
seen
in
the
mass
specialties
gain
if
enlarged
by
the
glass
gives
nature
and
god
his
own
fits
of
the
blues
and
rims
things
with
mystical
hues
sits
in
a
mystery
calm
and
intense
and
looks
coolly
around
him
with
sharp
common
sense
shows
you
how
matters
unite
with
the
dim
transdiurnal
recesses
of
night
while
in
a
plain
preternatural
way
makes
mysteries
matters
of
mere
every
day
draws
all
his
characters
quite
fuseli
he
do
sketch
their
bundles
of
muscles
and
thews
illy
but
he
paints
with
a
brush
so
untamed
and
profuse
they
seem
nothing
but
bundles
of
muscles
and
thews
is
rather
like
flaxman
lines
strait
and
severe
and
a
colorless
outline
but
full
round
and
clear
to
the
men
he
thinks
worthy
he
frankly
accords
the
design
of
a
white
marble
statue
in
words
labors
to
get
at
the
centre
and
then
take
a
reckoning
from
there
of
his
actions
and
men
calmly
assumes
the
said
centre
as
granted
and
given
himself
has
whatever
is
wanted
he
has
imitators
in
scores
who
omit
no
part
of
the
man
but
his
wisdom
and
wit
who
go
carefully
the
of
his
brain
and
when
he
has
skimmed
it
once
skim
it
again
if
at
all
they
resemble
him
you
may
be
sure
it
is
because
their
shoals
mirror
his
mists
and
obscurities
as
a
seems
deep
as
heaven
for
a
minute
while
a
cloud
that
floats
is
reflected
within
it
there
comes
for
instance
to
see
him
rare
sport
tread
in
emerson
tracks
with
legs
painfully
short
how
he
jumps
how
he
strains
and
gets
red
in
the
face
to
keep
step
with
the
mystagogue
natural
pace
he
follows
as
close
as
a
stick
to
a
rocket
his
fingers
exploring
the
prophet
each
pocket
fie
for
shame
brother
bard
with
good
fruit
of
your
own
ca
you
let
neighbor
emerson
orchards
alone
besides
is
no
use
you
not
find
a
core
has
picked
up
all
the
windfalls
before
they
might
strip
every
tree
and
never
would
catch
his
hesperides
have
no
rude
dragon
to
watch
when
they
send
him
a
dishfull
and
ask
him
to
try
he
never
suspects
how
the
sly
rogues
came
by
he
wonders
why
is
there
are
none
such
his
trees
on
and
thinks
the
best
he
has
tasted
this
season
yonder
calm
as
a
cloud
alcott
stalks
in
a
dream
and
fancies
himself
in
thy
groves
academe
with
the
parthenon
nigh
and
the
him
and
never
a
fact
to
perplex
him
or
bore
him
with
a
snug
room
at
plato
when
night
comes
to
walk
to
and
people
from
morning
till
midnight
to
talk
to
and
from
midnight
till
morning
nor
snore
in
their
listening
so
he
muses
his
face
with
the
joy
of
it
glistening
for
his
highest
conceit
of
a
happiest
state
is
where
they
live
upon
acorns
and
hear
him
talk
gratis
and
indeed
i
believe
no
man
ever
talked
better
each
sentence
hangs
perfectly
poised
to
a
letter
he
seems
piling
words
but
there
royal
dust
hid
in
the
heart
of
each
pyramid
while
he
talks
he
is
great
but
goes
out
like
a
taper
if
you
shut
him
up
closely
with
pen
ink
and
paper
yet
his
fingers
itch
for
from
morning
till
night
and
he
thinks
he
does
wrong
if
he
do
always
write
in
this
as
in
all
things
a
lamb
among
men
he
goes
to
sure
death
when
he
goes
to
his
pen
close
behind
him
is
brownson
his
mouth
very
full
with
attempting
to
gulp
a
gregorian
bull
who
contrives
spite
of
that
to
pour
out
as
he
goes
a
stream
of
transparent
and
forcible
prose
he
shifts
quite
about
then
proceeds
to
expound
that
is
merely
the
earth
not
himself
that
turns
round
and
wishes
it
clearly
impressed
on
your
mind
that
the
rules
and
not
follows
the
wind
proving
first
then
as
deftly
confuting
each
side
with
no
doctrine
pleased
that
not
somewhere
denied
he
lays
the
denier
away
on
the
shelf
and
then
down
beside
him
lies
gravely
himself
he
the
salt
river
boatman
who
always
stands
willing
to
convey
friend
or
foe
without
charging
a
shilling
and
so
fond
of
the
trip
that
when
leisure
to
spare
he
row
himself
up
if
he
ca
get
a
fare
the
worst
of
it
is
that
his
logic
so
strong
that
of
two
sides
he
commonly
chooses
the
wrong
if
there
only
one
why
he
split
it
in
two
and
first
pummel
this
half
then
that
black
and
blue
that
white
white
needs
no
proof
but
it
takes
a
deep
fellow
to
prove
it
and
that
is
yellow
he
offers
the
true
faith
to
drink
in
a
sieve
when
it
reaches
your
lips
there
naught
left
to
believe
but
a
few
i
mean
that
squat
like
tadpoles
with
the
mud
at
the
bottom
there
is
willis
so
and
jaunty
and
gay
who
says
his
best
things
in
so
foppish
a
way
with
conceits
and
pet
phrases
so
thickly
that
one
hardly
knows
whether
to
thank
him
for
saying
ruins
both
poem
and
prose
just
conceive
of
a
muse
with
a
ring
in
her
nose
his
prose
had
a
natural
grace
of
its
own
and
enough
of
it
too
if
he
let
it
alone
but
he
twitches
and
jerks
so
one
fairly
gets
tired
and
is
forced
to
forgive
where
he
might
have
admired
yet
whenever
it
slips
away
free
and
unlaced
it
runs
like
a
stream
with
a
musical
waste
and
gurgles
along
with
the
liquidest
sweep
is
not
deep
as
a
river
but
who
have
it
deep
in
a
country
where
scarcely
a
village
is
found
that
has
not
its
author
sublime
and
profound
for
some
one
to
be
slightly
shoal
is
a
duty
and
willis
shallowness
makes
half
his
beauty
his
prose
winds
along
with
a
blithe
gurgling
error
and
reflects
all
of
heaven
it
can
see
in
its
mirror
is
a
narrowish
strip
but
it
is
not
an
artifice
is
the
true
with
its
genuine
hearty
phiz
it
is
nature
herself
and
there
something
in
that
since
most
brains
reflect
but
the
crown
of
a
hat
no
volume
i
know
to
read
under
a
tree
more
truly
delicious
than
his
a
l
abri
with
the
shadows
of
leaves
flowing
over
your
book
like
netting
the
bed
of
a
brook
with
june
coming
softly
your
shoulder
to
look
over
breezes
waiting
to
turn
every
leaf
of
your
book
over
and
nature
to
criticise
still
as
you
read
the
page
that
bears
that
is
a
rare
one
indeed
he
so
innate
a
cockney
that
had
he
been
born
where
plain
the
only
that
is
worn
he
have
given
his
own
such
an
air
that
you
say
had
been
made
by
a
tailor
to
lounge
in
broadway
his
nature
a
glass
of
champagne
with
the
foam
on
as
tender
as
fletcher
as
witty
as
beaumont
so
his
best
things
are
done
in
the
flush
of
the
moment
if
he
wait
all
is
spoiled
he
may
stir
it
and
shake
it
but
the
fixed
air
once
gone
he
can
never
it
he
might
be
a
marvel
of
easy
delightfulness
if
he
would
not
sometimes
leave
the
r
out
of
sprightfulness
and
he
ought
to
let
scripture
alone
is
for
nobody
likes
he
have
been
just
the
fellow
to
sup
at
the
mermaid
cracking
jokes
at
rare
ben
with
an
eye
to
the
barmaid
his
wit
running
up
as
canary
ran
down
the
topmost
bright
bubble
on
the
wave
of
the
town
here
comes
parker
the
orson
of
parsons
a
man
whom
the
church
undertook
to
put
under
her
ban
the
church
of
socinus
i
mean
his
opinions
being
ultra
they
shocked
the
socinians
they
believed
faith
i
puzzled
i
think
i
may
call
their
belief
a
believing
in
nothing
at
all
or
something
of
that
sort
i
know
they
all
went
for
a
general
union
of
total
dissent
he
went
a
step
farther
without
cough
or
hem
he
frankly
avowed
he
believed
not
in
them
and
before
he
could
be
jumbled
up
or
prevented
from
their
orthodox
kind
of
dissent
he
dissented
there
was
heresy
here
you
perceive
for
the
right
of
privately
judging
means
simply
that
light
has
been
granted
to
for
deciding
on
and
in
happier
times
before
atheism
grew
the
deed
contained
clauses
for
cooking
you
too
now
at
xerxes
and
knut
we
all
laugh
yet
our
foot
with
the
same
wave
is
wet
that
mocked
xerxes
and
knut
and
we
all
entertain
a
sincere
private
notion
that
our
far
will
have
a
great
weight
with
the
ocean
was
so

christians

with

conviction
their
chairs
to

they
brandished
their
worn
theological
birches
bade
natural
progress
keep
out
of
the
churches
and
expected
the
lines
they
had
drawn
to
prevail
with
the
tide
to
keep
out
of
their
pale
they
had
formerly
dammed
the
pontifical
see
and
the
same
thing
they
thought
would
do
nicely
for
but
he
turned
up
his
nose
at
their
murmuring
and
shamming
and
cared
shall
i
say
not
a
d
for
their
damming
so
they
first
read
him
out
of
their
church
and
next
minute
turned
round
and
declared
he
had
never
been
in
it
but
the
ban
was
too
small
or
the
man
was
too
big
for
he
recks
not

with

torn
up

his

on

for
he

fired
that
all

not

inspired
yet
tho
wisdom
profane
with
his
creed
he
may
weave
in
he
makes
it
quite
clear
what
he
believe
in
while
some
who
decry
him
think
all
kingdom
come
is
a
sort
of
a
kind
of
a
species
of
hum
of
which
as
it
were
so
to
speak
not
a
crumb
would
be
left
if
we
did
keep
carefully
mum
and
to
make
a
clean
breast
that
is
perfectly
plain
that
kinds
of
wisdom
are
somewhat
profane
now
creed
than
this
may
be
lighter
or
darker
but
in
one
thing
is
clear
he
has
faith
namely
parker
and
this
is
what
makes
him
the
preacher
there
a
background
of
god
to
each
feature
every
word
that
he
speaks
has
been
fierily
furnaced
in
the
blast
of
a
life
that
has
struggled
in
earnest
there
he
stands
looking
more
like
a
ploughman
than
priest
if
not
dreadfully
awkward
not
graceful
at
least
his
gestures
all
downright
and
same
if
you
will
as
of
hobnail
in
hoeing
a
drill
but
his
periods
fall
on
you
stroke
after
stroke
like
the
blows
of
a
lumberer
felling
an
oak
you
forget
the
man
wholly
you
thankful
to
meet
with
a
preacher
who
smacks
of
the
field
and
the
street
and
to
hear
you
not
whence
almost
taylor
profusion
quite
latimer
sense
there
is
bryant
as
quiet
as
cool
and
as
dignified
as
a
smooth
silent
iceberg
that
never
is
ignified
save
when
by
reflection
is
kindled
o
nights
with
a
semblance
of
flame
by
the
chill
northern
lights
he
may
rank
griswold
says
so
first
bard
of
your
nation
there
no
doubt
that
he
stands
in
supreme
iceolation
your
topmost
parnassus
he
may
set
his
heel
on
but
no
warm
applauses
come
peal
following
peal
on
he
too
smooth
and
too
polished
to
hang
any
zeal
on
unqualified
merits
i
grant
if
you
choose
he
has
but
he
lacks
the
one
merit
of
kindling
enthusiasm
if
he
stir
you
at
all
it
is
just
on
my
soul
like
being
stirred
up
with
the
very
north
pole
he
is
very
nice
reading
in
summer
but
we
do
want
freezing
in
winter
take
him
up
in
the
depth
of
july
my
advice
is
when
you
feel
an
egyptian
devotion
to
ices
but
deduct
all
you
can
there
enough
that
right
good
in
him
he
has
a
true
soul
for
field
river
and
wood
in
him
and
his
heart
in
the
midst
of
brick
walls
or
it
is
glows
softens
and
thrills
with
the
tenderest
charities
to
you
mortals
that
delve
in
this
planet
no
to
old
berkshire
hills
with
their
limestone
and
granite
if
you
one
who
add
here
you
will
get
of
his
outermost
heart
as
i
guess
a
piece
but
you
get
deeper
down
if
you
came
as
a
precipice
and
would
break
the
last
seal
of
its
inwardest
fountain
if
you
only
could
palm
yourself
off
for
a
mountain
quivis
or
somebody
quite
as
discerning
some
scholar
who
hourly
expecting
his
learning
calls
the
american
wordsworth
but
wordsworth
is
worth
near
as
much
as
your
whole
tuneful
herd
worth
no
do
be
absurd
he
an
excellent
bryant
but
my
friends
you
endanger
the
life
of
your
client
by
attempting
to
stretch
him
up
into
a
giant
if
you
choose
to
compare
him
i
think
there
are
two
sons
fit
for
a
parallel
thomson
and
cowper
c
i
do
mean
exactly
there
something
of
each
there
love
of
nature
penchant
to
preach
just
mix
up
their
minds
so
that
spice
of
craziness
shall
balance
and
neutralize
turn
for
laziness
and
it
gives
you
a
brain
cool
quite
frictionless
quiet
whose
internal
police
nips
the
buds
of
all
riot
a
brain
like
a
permanent
put
on
the
heart
which
strives
vainly
to
burst
off
a
button
a
brain
which
without
being
slow
or
mechanic
does
more
than
a
larger
less
drilled
more
volcanic
he
a
cowper
condensed
with
no
craziness
bitten
and
the
advantage
that
wordsworth
before
him
has
written
footnote
c
to
demonstrate
quickly
and
easily
how
absurd
is
to
sound
this
name
as
people
in
general
call
him
named
i
just
add
that
he
rhymes
it
himself
with
but
my
dear
little
bardlings
do
prick
up
your
ears
nor
suppose
i
would
rank
you
and
bryant
as
peers
if
i
call
him
an
iceberg
i
do
mean
to
say
there
is
nothing
in
that
which
is
grand
in
its
way
he
is
almost
the
one
of
your
poets
that
knows
how
much
grace
strength
and
dignity
lie
in
repose
if
he
sometimes
fall
short
he
is
too
wise
to
mar
his
thought
modest
fulness
by
going
too
far
be
well
if
your
authors
should
all
make
a
trial
of
what
virtue
there
is
in
severe
and
measure
their
writings
by
hesiod
staff
which
teaches
that
all
have
less
value
than
half
there
is
whittier
whose
swelling
and
vehement
heart
strains
the
drab
of
the
quaker
apart
and
reveals
the
live
man
still
supreme
and
erect
underneath
the
bemummying
wrappers
of
sect
there
was
a
man
born
who
had
more
of
the
swing
of
the
true
lyric
bard
and
all
that
kind
of
thing
and
his
failures
arise
though
perhaps
he
do
know
it
from
the
very
same
cause
that
has
made
him
a
poet
a
fervor
of
mind
which
knows
no
separation
simple
excitement
and
pure
inspiration
as
my
pythoness
erst
sometimes
erred
from
not
knowing
if
i
or
mere
wind
through
her
tripod
was
blowing
let
his
mind
once
get
head
in
its
favorite
direction
and
the
torrent
of
verse
bursts
the
dams
of
reflection
while
borne
with
the
rush
of
the
metre
along
the
poet
may
chance
to
go
right
or
go
wrong
content
with
the
whirl
and
delirium
of
song
then
his
grammar
not
always
correct
nor
his
rhymes
and
he
prone
to
repeat
his
own
lyrics
sometimes
not
his
best
though
for
those
are
struck
off
at
when
the
heart
in
his
breast
like
a
beats
and
can
be
repeated
again
any
more
than
they
could
have
been
carefully
plotted
before
like
old
there
at
the
battle
of
hastings
who
however
gave
more
than
mere
rhythmical
bastings
our
quaker
leads
off
metaphorical
fights
for
reform
and
whatever
they
call
human
rights
both
singing
and
striking
in
front
of
the
war
and
hitting
his
foes
with
the
mallet
of
thor
one
exclaims
on
beholding
his
knocks
filii
o
fox
can
that
be
thy
son
in
the
battle
mid
din
preaching
brotherly
love
and
then
driving
it
in
to
the
brain
of
the
tough
old
goliah
of
sin
with
the
smoothest
of
pebbles
from
castaly
spring
impressed
on
his
hard
moral
sense
with
a
sling
all
honor
and
praise
to
the
bard
who
was
true
to
the
voice
when
such
service
was
hard
who
himself
was
so
free
he
dared
sing
for
the
slave
when
to
look
but
a
protest
in
silence
was
brave
all
honor
and
praise
to
the
women
and
men
who
spoke
out
for
the
dumb
and
the
then
i
need
not
to
name
them
already
for
each
i
see
history
preparing
the
statue
and
niche
they
were
harsh
but
shall
be
so
shocked
at
hard
words
who
have
beaten
your
up
into
swords
whose
rewards
and
hurrahs
men
are
surer
to
gain
by
the
reaping
of
men
and
of
women
than
grain
why
should
stand
aghast
at
their
fierce
wordy
war
if
you
scalp
one
another
for
bank
or
for
tariff
your
calling
them
and
knaves
all
day
long
do
prove
that
the
use
of
hard
language
is
wrong
while
the
world
heart
beats
quicker
to
think
of
such
men
as
signed
tyranny
doom
with
a
bloody
while
on
beardless
orators
fright
one
with
hints
at
harmodius
and
aristogeiton
you
need
not
look
shy
at
your
sisters
and
brothers
who
stab
with
sharp
words
for
the
freedom
of
others
no
a
wreath
twine
a
wreath
for
the
loyal
and
true
who
for
the
sake
of
the
many
dared
stand
with
the
few
not
of
laurel
for
enemies
braved
but
of
broad
peaceful
for
citizens
saved
here
comes
dana
abstractedly
loitering
along
involved
in
a
of
song
who
be
going
to
write
what
never
be
written
till
the
muse
ere
he
thinks
of
it
gives
him
the
mitten
who
is
so
well
aware
of
how
things
should
be
done
that
his
own
works
displease
him
before
they
begun
who
so
well
all
that
makes
up
good
poetry
knows
that
the
best
of
his
poems
is
written
in
prose
all
saddled
and
bridled
stood
pegasus
waiting
he
was
booted
and
spurred
but
he
loitered
debating
in
a
very
grave
question
his
soul
was
immersed
which
foot
in
the
stirrup
he
ought
to
put
first
and
while
this
point
and
that
he
judicially
dwelt
on
he
somehow
or
other
had
written
paul
felton
whose
beauties
or
faults
whichsoever
you
see
there
you
allow
only
genius
could
hit
upon
either
that
he
once
was
the
idle
man
none
will
deplore
but
i
fear
he
will
never
be
anything
more
the
ocean
of
song
heaves
and
glitters
before
him
the
depth
and
the
vastness
and
longing
sweep
him
he
knows
every
breaker
and
shoal
on
the
chart
he
has
the
coast
pilot
and
so
on
by
heart
yet
he
spends
his
whole
life
like
the
man
in
the
fable
in
learning
to
swim
on
his
there
swaggers
john
neal
who
has
wasted
in
maine
the
sinews
and
chords
of
his
pugilist
brain
who
might
have
been
poet
but
that
in
its
stead
he
preferred
to
believe
that
he
was
so
already
too
hasty
to
wait
till
art
ripe
fruit
should
drop
he
must
pelt
down
an
unripe
and
colicky
crop
who
took
to
the
law
and
had
this
sterling
plea
for
it
it
required
him
to
quarrel
and
paid
him
a
fee
for
it
a
man
who
made
less
than
he
might
have
because
he
always
has
thought
himself
more
than
he
was
who
with
very
good
natural
gifts
as
a
bard
broke
the
strings
of
his
lyre
out
by
striking
too
hard
and
cracked
half
the
notes
of
a
truly
fine
voice
because
song
drew
less
instant
attention
than
noise
ah
men
do
not
know
how
much
strength
is
in
poise
that
he
goes
the
farthest
who
goes
far
enough
and
that
all
beyond
that
is
just
bother
and
stuff
no
vain
man
matures
he
makes
too
much
new
wood
his
blooms
are
too
thick
for
the
fruit
to
be
good
is
the
modest
man
ripens
is
he
that
achieves
just
what
needed
of
sunshine
and
shade
he
receives
grapes
to
mellow
require
the
cool
dark
of
their
leaves
neal
wants
balance
he
throws
his
mind
always
too
far
whisking
out
flocks
of
comets
but
never
a
star
he
has
so
much
muscle
and
loves
so
to
show
it
that
he
strips
himself
naked
to
prove
he
a
poet
and
to
show
he
could
leap
art
wide
ditch
if
he
tried
jumps
clean
it
and
into
the
hedge
side
he
has
strength
but
there
nothing
about
him
in
keeping
one
gets
surelier
onward
by
walking
than
leaping
he
has
used
his
own
sinews
himself
to
distress
and
had
done
vastly
more
had
he
done
vastly
less
in
letters
too
soon
is
as
bad
as
too
late
could
he
only
have
waited
he
might
have
been
great
but
he
plumped
into
helicon
up
to
the
waist
and
muddied
the
stream
ere
he
took
his
first
taste
there
is
hawthorne
with
genius
so
shrinking
and
rare
that
you
hardly
at
first
see
the
strength
that
is
there
a
frame
so
robust
with
a
nature
so
sweet
so
earnest
so
graceful
so
solid
so
fleet
is
worth
a
descent
from
olympus
to
meet
is
as
if
a
rough
oak
that
for
ages
had
stood
with
his
gnarled
bony
branches
like
ribs
of
the
wood
should
bloom
after
cycles
of
struggle
and
scathe
with
a
single
anemone
trembly
and
rathe
his
strength
is
so
tender
his
wildness
so
meek
that
a
suitable
parallel
sets
one
to
seek
he
a
john
bunyan
fouqué
a
puritan
tieck
when
nature
was
shaping
him
clay
was
not
granted
for
making
so
a
man
as
she
wanted
so
to
fill
out
her
model
a
little
she
spared
from
some
stuff
for
a
woman
prepared
and
she
could
not
have
hit
a
more
excellent
plan
for
making
him
fully
and
perfectly
man
the
success
of
her
scheme
gave
her
so
much
delight
that
she
tried
it
again
shortly
after
in
dwight
only
while
she
was
kneading
and
shaping
the
clay
she
sang
to
her
work
in
her
sweet
childish
way
and
found
when
she
put
the
last
touch
to
his
soul
that
the
music
had
somehow
got
mixed
with
the
whole
here
cooper
who
written
six
volumes
to
show
he
as
good
as
a
lord
well
let
grant
that
he
so
if
a
person
prefer
that
description
of
praise
why
a
coronet
certainly
cheaper
than
bays
but
he
need
take
no
pains
to
convince
us
he
not
as
his
enemies
say
the
american
scott
choose
any
twelve
men
and
let
read
aloud
that
one
of
his
novels
of
which
he
most
proud
and
i
lay
any
bet
that
without
ever
quitting
their
box
they
be
all
to
a
man
for
acquitting
he
has
drawn
you
one
character
though
that
is
new
one
wildflower
he
plucked
that
is
wet
with
the
dew
of
this
fresh
western
world
and
the
thing
not
to
mince
he
has
done
naught
but
copy
it
ill
ever
since
his
indians
with
proper
respect
be
it
said
are
just
natty
bumpo
daubed
over
with
red
and
his
very
long
toms
are
the
same
useful
nat
rigged
up
in
duck
pants
and
a
hat
though
once
in
a
coffin
a
good
chance
was
found
to
have
slipt
the
old
fellow
away
underground
all
his
other
are
clothes
upon
sticks
the
of
a
man
in
a
fix
as
a
captain
besieged
when
his

all

as

goes
to
the

as
a

a

he
picks
out
the

hoops
them

if

the

do

i

the

you

the

there
is
one
thing
in
cooper
i
like
too
and
that
is
that
on
manners
he
lectures
his
countrymen
gratis
not
precisely
so
either
because
for
a
rarity
he
is
paid
for
his
tickets
in
unpopularity
now
he
may
overcharge
his
american
pictures
but
you
grant
there
a
good
deal
of
truth
in
his
strictures
and
i
honor
the
man
who
is
willing
to
sink
half
his

repute
for
the
freedom
to
think
and
when
he
has
thought
be
his

strong

weak
will
risk
t

half

the

to
speak
caring
naught
for
what
vengeance
the

let
that
mob
be
the

ten

there
are
truths
you
americans
need

it
never
refute

to

scold

looking
the

choler
at
your

says
you
worship

to

such
what
very
few
do

john
goes
to
that
church
as
often
as
you
do
no
matter
what
john
says
do
try
to
outcrow
him
is
enough
to
go
quietly
on
and
outgrow
him
like
most

bull
hates
to
see
number
one
displacing
himself
in
the

detests
the

in

he
neglected

one
another

you
a

your

for
naught
but
to
show
what
a
nice

of
horns
you
beginning
to
grow
there
are
one
or
two
things
i
should
just
like
to
hint
for
you
do
often
get
the
truth
told
you
in
print
the
most
of
you
this
is
what
strikes
all
beholders
have
a
mental
and
physical
stoop
in
the
shoulders
though
you
ought
to
be
free
as
the
winds
and
the
waves
you
the
gait
and
the
manners
of
runaway
slaves
tho
you
brag
of
your
new
world
you
do
half
believe
in
it
and
as
much
of
the
old
as
is
possible
weave
in
it
your
goddess
of
freedom
a
tight
buxom
girl
with
lips
like
a
cherry
and
teeth
like
a
pearl
with
eyes
bold
as
herè
and
hair
floating
free
and
full
of
the
sun
as
the
spray
of
the
sea
who
can
sing
at
a
husking
or
romp
at
a
shearing
who
can
trip
through
the
forests
alone
without
fearing
who
can
drive
home
the
cows
with
a
song
through
the
grass
keeps
glancing
aside
into
europe
cracked
glass
hides
her
red
hands
in
gloves
pinches
up
her
lithe
waist
and
makes
herself
wretched
with
transmarine
taste
she
loses
her
fresh
country
charm
when
she
takes
any
mirror
except
her
own
rivers
and
lakes
you
steal
englishmen
books
and
think
englishmen
thought
with
their
salt
on
her
tail
your
wild
eagle
is
caught
your
literature
suits
its
each
whisper
and
motion
to
what
will
be
thought
of
it
over
the
ocean
the
cast
clothes
of
europe
your
statesmanship
tries
and
mumbles
again
the
old
blarneys
and
lies
forget
europe
wholly
your
veins
throb
with
blood
to
which
the
dull
current
in
hers
is
but
mud
let
her
sneer
let
her
say
your
experiment
fails
in
her
voice
there
a
tremble
now
while
she
rails
and
your
shore
will
soon
be
in
the
nature
of
things
covered
thick
with
gilt
driftwood
of
runaway
kings
where
alone
as
it

thank
your

your

keep
your

open
wide
to
the

first

whatever
you

but
yourselves
first
of
all
stand
fronting
the
dawn
on
toil
peaks
and
become
my
new
race
of
more
practical
hem
your
likeness
at
present
i
shudder
to
tell
is
that
you
have
your
slaves
and
the
greek
had
his
helot
here
a
gentleman
present
who
had
in
his
attic
more
pepper
than
brains
shrieked
the
man
a
fanatic
i
a
capital
tailor
with
warm
tar
and
feathers
and
will
make
him
a
suit
that
serve
in
all
weathers
but
we
argue
the
point
first
i
willing
to
reaso
palaver
before
condemnation
but
decent
so
through
my
humble
person
humanity
begs
of
the
friends
of
true
freedom
a
loan
of
bad
eggs
but
apollo
let
one
such
a
look
of
his
show
forth
as
when
ἤϊε
νύκτι
ἐοικώς
and
so
forth
and
the
gentleman
somehow
slunk
out
of
the
way
but
as
he
was
going
gained
courage
to
say
at
slavery
in
the
abstract
my
whole
soul
rebels
i
am
as
strongly
opposed
as
any
one
else
ay
no
doubt
but
whenever
i
happened
to
meet
with
a
wrong
or
a
crime
it
is
always
concrete
answered
phœbus
severely
then
turning
to
us
the
mistake
of
such
fellows
as
just
made
the
fuss
is
only
in
taking
a
great
busy
nation
for
a
part
of
their
pitiful
but
there
comes
miranda
zeus
where
shall
i
flee
to
she
has
such
a
penchant
for
bothering
me
too
she
always
keeps
asking
if
i
do
observe
a
particular
likeness
her
and
minerva
she
tells
me
my
efforts
in
verse
are
quite
clever
she
been
travelling
now
and
will
be
worse
than
ever
one
would
think
though
a
noter
she
be
of
all
that
worth
mentioning
over
the
sea
for
a
woman
must
surely
see
well
if
she
try
the
whole
of
whose
being
a
capital
i
she
will
take
an
old
notion
and
make
it
her
own
by
saying
it
in
her
sibylline
tone
or
persuade
you
is
something
tremendously
deep
by
repeating
it
so
as
to
put
you
to
sleep
and
she
well
may
defy
any
mortal
to
see
through
it
when
once
she
has
mixed
up
her
infinite
me
through
it
there
is
one
thing
she
owns
in
her
own
single
right
it
is
native
and
genuine
namely
her
spite
though
when
acting
as
censor
she
privately
blows
a
censer
of
vanity
her
own
nose
here
miranda
came
up
and
said
phœbus
you
know
that
the
infinite
soul
has
its
infinite
woe
as
i
ought
to
know
having
lived
cheek
by
jowl
since
the
day
i
was
born
with
the
infinite
soul
i
myself
introduced
i
myself
i
alone
to
my
land
better
life
authors
solely
my
own
who
the
sad
heart
of
earth
on
their
shoulders
have
taken
whose
works
sound
a
depth
by
life
quiet
unshaken
such
as
shakspeare
for
instance
the
bible
and
bacon
not
to
mention
my
own
works
time
nadir
is
fleet
and
as
for
myself
i
quite
out
of
conceit
quite
out
of
conceit
i
enchanted
to
hear
it
cried
apollo
aside
who
have
thought
she
was
near
it
to
be
sure
one
is
apt
to
exhaust
those
commodities
he
uses
too
fast
yet
in
this
case
as
odd
it
is
as
if
neptune
should
say
to
his
turbots
and
whitings
as
much
out
of
salt
as
miranda
own
writings
which
as
she
in
her
own
happy
manner
has
said
sound
a
depth
for
is
one
of
the
functions
of
lead
she
often
has
asked
me
if
i
could
not
find
a
place
somewhere
near
me
that
suited
her
mind
i
know
but
a
single
one
vacant
which
she
with
her
rare
talent
that
way
would
fit
to
a
and
it
would
not
imply
any
pause
or
cessation
in
the
work
she
esteems
her
peculiar
vocation
she
may
enter
on
duty
if
she
chooses
and
remain
for
life
to
the
muses
miranda
meanwhile
has
succeeded
in
driving
up
into
a
corner
in
spite
of
their
striving
a
small
flock
of
terrified
victims
and
there
with
an
air
and
a
tone
which
at
least
to
fancy
appears
not
so
much
to
be
entering
as
boxing
your
ears
is
unfolding
a
tale
of
herself
i
surmise
for
is
dotted
as
thick
as
a
peacock
with
i
of
miranda
i
rest
on
my
oars
and
drift
through
a
trifling
digression
on
bores
for
though
not
wearing
more
our
ears
are
kept
bored
just
as
if
we
still
wore
there
was
one
feudal
custom
worth
keeping
at
least
roasted
bores
made
a
part
of
each
feast
and
of
all
quiet
pleasures
the
very
was
in
hunting
wild
bores
as
the
tame
ones
hunt
us
archæologians
i
know
who
have
personal
fears
of
this
wise
application
of
hounds
and
of
spears
have
tried
to
make
out
with
a
zeal
more
than
wonted
was
a
kind
of
wild
swine
that
our
ancestors
hunted
but
i
never
believe
that
the
age
which
has
strewn
europe
with
cathedrals
and
otherwise
shown
that
it
knew
what
was
what
could
by
chance
not
have
known
spending
too
its
chief
time
with
its
buff
on
no
doubt
which
beast
improve
the
world
most
to
thin
out
i
divide
bores
myself
in
the
manner
of
rifles
into
two
great
divisions
regardless
of
trifles
there
your
and
who
do
not
much
vary
in
the
weight
of
cold
lead
they
respectively
carry
the
is
one
in
whose
essence
the
mind
not
a
corner
nor
cranny
to
cling
by
can
find
you
feel
as
in
nightmares
sometimes
when
you
slip
down
a
steep
slated
roof
where
there
nothing
to
grip
you
slide
and
you
slide
the
blank
horror
increases
you
had
rather
by
far
be
at
once
smashed
to
pieces
you
fancy
a
whirlpool
below
white
and
frothing
and
finally
drop
off
and
light
upon
nothing
the
has
twists
in
him
faint
predilections
for
going
just
wrong
in
the
tritest
directions
when
he
wrong
he
is
flat
when
he
right
he
ca
show
it
he
tell
you
what
snooks
said
about
the
new
poet
d
or
how
fogrum
was
outraged
by
tennyson
princess
he
has
spent
all
his
spare
time
and
intellect
since
his
birth
in
perusing
on
each
art
and
science
just
the
books
in
which
no
one
puts
any
reliance
and
though
we
told
omnibus
the
rule
will
not
fit
him
however
you
shape
it
for
he
has
a
perennial
foison
of
sappiness
he
has
just
enough
force
to
spoil
half
your
day
happiness
and
to
make
him
a
sort
of
mosquito
to
be
with
but
just
not
enough
to
dispute
or
agree
with
footnote
d
if
you
call
snooks
an
owl
he
will
show
by
his
looks
that
he
morally

jealous
of
snooks
these
sketches
i
made
not
to
be
too
explicit
from
two
honest
fellows
who
made
me
a
visit
and
broke
like
the
tale
of
the
bear
and
the
fiddle
my
reflections
on
halleck
short
off
by
the
middle
i
shall
not
now
go
into
the
subject
more
deeply
for
i
notice
that
some
of
my
readers
look
i
will
barely
remark
that
civilized
nations
there
none
that
displays
more
exemplary
patience
under
all
sorts
of
boring
at
all
sorts
of
hours
from
all
sorts
of
desperate
persons
than
ours
not
to
speak
of
our
papers
our
state
legislatures
and
other
such
trials
for
sensitive
natures
just
look
for
a
moment
at
congress
appalled
my
fancy
shrinks
back
from
the
phantom
it
called
why
there
scarcely
a
member
unworthy
to
frown
what
fourier
nicknames
the
boreal
crown
only
think
what
that
infinite
could
do
if
applied
with
a
utilitarian
view
suppose
for
example
we
shipped
it
with
care
to
sahara
great
desert
and
let
it
bore
there
if
they
held
one
short
session
and
did
nothing
else
they
fill
the
whole
waste
with
artesian
wells
but
is
time
now
with
pen
phonographic
to
follow
through
some
more
of
his
sketches
our
laughing
apollo
there
comes
harry
franco
and
as
he
draws
near
you
find
that
a
smile
which
you
took
for
a
sneer
one
half
of
him
contradicts
his
wont
is
to
say
very
sharp
things
and
do
very
blunt
his
manner
as
hard
as
his
feelings
are
tender
and
a
he
make
when
he
means
to
surrender
he
in
joke
half
the
time
when
he
seems
to
be
sternest
when
he
seems
to
be
joking
be
sure
he
in
earnest
he
has
common
sense
in
a
way
that
uncommon
hates
humbug
and
cant
loves
his
friends
like
a
woman
builds
his
dislikes
of
cards
and
his
friendships
of
oak
loves
a
prejudice
better
than
aught
but
a
joke
is
half
upright
quaker
half
downright
loves
freedom
too
well
to
go
stark
mad
about
her
quite
artless
himself
is
a
lover
of
art
shuts
you
out
of
his
secrets
and
into
his
heart
and
though
not
a
poet
yet
all
must
admire
in
his
letters
of
pinto
his
skill
on
the
liar
there
comes
poe
with
his
raven
like
barnaby
rudge
of
him
genius
and
sheer
fudge
who
talks
like
a
book
of
iambs
and
pentameters
in
a
way
to
make
people
of
damn
metres
who
has
written
some
things
quite
the
best
of
their
kind
but
the
heart
somehow
seems
all
squeezed
out
by
the
mind
who
but
what
this
messieurs
mathews
and
poe
you
must
fling
at
longfellow
so
does
it
make
a
man
worse
that
his
character
such
as
to
make
his
friends
love
him
as
you
think
too
much
why
there
is
not
a
bard
at
this
moment
alive
more
willing
than
he
that
his
fellows
should
thrive
while
you
are
abusing
him
thus
even
now
he
would
help
either
one
of
you
out
of
a
slough
you
may
say
that
he
smooth
and
all
that
till
you
hoarse
but
remember
that
elegance
also
is
force
after
polishing
granite
as
much
as
you
will
the
heart
keeps
its
tough
old
persistency
still
deduct
all
you
can
that
still
keeps
you
at
bay
why
he
live
till
men
weary
of
collins
and
gray
i
not
of
greek
metres
in
english
to
me
rhyme
a
gain
so
it
be
not
too
jinglish
and
your
modern
hexameter
verses
are
no
more
like
greek
ones
than
sleek
pope
is
like
homer
as
the
roar
of
the
sea
to
the
coo
of
a
pigeon
is
so
compared
to
your
moderns
sounds
old
melesigenes
i
may
be
too
partial
the
reason
perhaps
that
i
heard
the
old
blind
man
recite
his
own
rhapsodies
and
my
ear
with
that
music
impregnate
may
be
like
the
poor
exiled
shell
with
the
soul
of
the
sea
or
as
one
ca
bear
strauss
when
his
nature
is
cloven
to
its
deeps
within
deeps
by
the
stroke
of
beethoven
but
set
that
aside
and
is
truth
that
i
speak
had
theocritus
written
in
english
not
greek
i
believe
that
his
exquisite
sense
would
scarce
change
a
line
in
that
rare
tender
pastoral
evangeline
that
not
ancient
nor
modern
its
place
is
apart
where
time
has
no
sway
in
the
realm
of
pure
art
is
a
shrine
of
retreat
from
earth
hubbub
and
strife
as
quiet
and
chaste
as
the
author
own
life
there
comes
philothea
her
face
all
she
has
just
been
dividing
some
poor
creature
woe
and
ca
tell
which
pleases
her
most
to
relieve
his
want
or
his
story
to
hear
and
believe
no
doubt
against
many
deep
griefs
she
prevails
for
her
ear
is
the
refuge
of
destitute
tales
she
knows
well
that
silence
is
sorrow
best
food
and
that
talking
draws
off
from
the
heart
its
black
blood
so
she
listen
with
patience
and
let
you
unfold
your
bundle
of
rags
as
pure
cloth
of
gold
which
indeed
it
all
turns
to
as
soon
as
she
touched
it
and
to
borrow
a
phrase
from
the
nursery
it
she
has
such
a
musical
taste
she
will
go
any
distance
to
hear
one
who
draws
a
long
bow
she
will
swallow
a
wonder
by
mere
might
and
main
and
thinks
it
geometry
fault
if
she
fain
to
consider
things
flat
inasmuch
as
they
plain
facts
with
her
are
accomplished
as
frenchmen
would
say
they
will
prove
all
she
wishes
them
to
either
way
and
as
fact
lies
on
this
side
or
that
we
must
try
if
we
seeking
the
truth
to
find
where
it
do
lie
i
was
telling
her
once
of
a
marvellous
aloe
that
for
thousands
of
years
had
looked
spindling
and
sallow
and
though
nursed
by
the
fruitfullest
powers
of
mud
had
never
vouchsafed
so
much
as
a
bud
till
its
owner
remarked
as
a
sailor
you
know
often
will
in
a
calm
that
it
never
would
blow
for
he
wished
to
exhibit
the
plant
and
designed
that
its
blowing
should
help
him
in
raising
the
wind
at
last
it
was
told
him
that
if
he
should
water
its
roots
with
the
blood
of
his
unmarried
daughter
who
was
born
as
her
mother
a
calvinist
said
with
a
baxter
effectual
caul
on
her
head
it
would
blow
as
the
obstinate
breeze
did
when
by
a
like
decree
of
her
father
died
iphigenia
at
first
he
declared
he
himself
would
be
blowed
ere
his
conscience
with
such
a
foul
crime
he
would
load
but
the
thought
coming
oft
grew
less
dark
than
before
and
he
mused
as
each
creditor
knocked
at
his
door
if
were
but
done
they
would
dun
me
no
more
i
told
philothea
his
struggles
and
doubts
and
how
he
considered
the
ins
and
the
outs
of
the
visions
he
had
and
the
dreadful
dyspepsy
how
he
went
to
the
seer
that
lives
at
how
the
seer
advised
him
to
sleep
on
it
first
and
to
read
his
big
volume
in
case
of
the
worst
and
further
advised
he
should
pay
him
five
dollars
for
writing
on
his
wristbands
and
collars
three
years
and
ten
days
these
dark
words
he
had
studied
when
the
daughter
was
missed
and
the
aloe
had
budded
i
told
how
he
watched
it
grow
large
and
more
large
and
wondered
how
much
for
the
show
he
should
charge
she
had
listened
with
utter
indifference
to
this
till
i
told
how
it
bloomed
and
discharging
its
pistil
with
an
aim
the
eumenides
dictated
shot
the
botanical
filicide
dead
on
the
spot
it
had
blown
but
he
reaped
not
his
horrible
gains
for
it
blew
with
such
force
as
to
blow
out
his
brains
and
the
crime
was
blown
also
because
on
the
wad
which
was
paper
was
writ
of
god
as
well
as
a
thrilling
account
of
the
deed
which
the
coroner
kindly
allowed
me
to
read
well
my
friend
took
this
story
up
just
to
be
sure
as
one
might
a
poor
foundling
that
laid
at
one
door
she
combed
it
and
washed
it
and
clothed
it
and
fed
it
and
as
if
were
her
own
child
most
tenderly
bred
it
laid
the
scene
of
the
legend
i
mean
far
away
the
green
vales
underneath
himalaya
and
by
touches
laid
on
here
and
there
made
the
whole
thing
so
touching
i
frankly
declare
i
have
read
it
all
thrice
and
perhaps
i
am
weak
but
i
found
every
time
there
were
tears
on
my
cheek
the
pole
science
tells
us
the
magnet
controls
but
she
is
a
magnet
to
emigrant
poles
and
folks
with
a
mission
that
nobody
knows
throng
thickly
about
her
as
bees
round
a
rose
she
can
fill
up
the
in
such
make
their
scope
converge
to
some
focus
of
rational
hope
and
with
sympathies
fresh
as
the
morning
their
gall
can
transmute
into
honey
but
this
is
not
all
not
only
for
those
she
has
solace
oh
say
vice
desperate
nursling
adrift
in
broadway
who
clingest
with
all
that
is
left
of
thee
human
to
the
last
slender
spar
from
the
wreck
of
the
woman
hast
thou
not
found
one
shore
where
those
tired
drooping
feet
could
reach
firm
one
full
heart
on
whose
beat
the
soothed
head
in
silence
reposing
could
hear
the
chimes
of
far
childhood
throb
back
on
the
ear
ah
there
many
a
beam
from
the
fountain
of
day
that
to
reach
us
unclouded
must
pass
on
its
way
through
the
soul
of
a
woman
and
hers
is
wide
ope
to
the
influence
of
heaven
as
the
blue
eyes
of
hope
yes
a
great
soul
is
hers
one
that
dares
to
go
in
to
the
prison
the
the
alleys
of
sin
and
to
bring
into
each
or
to
find
there
some
line
of
the
never
completely
divine
if
her
heart
at
high
floods
swamps
her
brain
now
and
then
is
but
richer
for
that
when
the
tide
ebbs
agen
as
after
old
nile
has
subsided
his
plain
overflows
with
a
second
broad
deluge
of
grain
what
a
wealth
would
it
bring
to
the
narrow
and
sour
could
they
be
as
a
child
but
for
one
little
hour
what
irving
thrice
welcome
warm
heart
and
fine
brain
you
bring
back
the
happiest
spirit
from
spain
and
the
gravest
sweet
humor
that
ever
were
there
since
cervantes
met
death
in
his
gentle
despair
nay
do
be
embarrassed
nor
look
so
beseeching
i
sha
run
directly
against
my
own
preaching
and
having
just
laughed
at
their
raphaels
and
dantes
go
to
setting
you
up
beside
matchless
cervantes
but
allow
me
to
speak
what
i
honestly
feel
to
a
true
add
the
fun
of
dick
steele
throw
in
all
of
addison
the
chill
with
the
whole
of
that
partnership
stock
and
good
will
mix
well
and
while
stirring
hum
as
a
spell
the
fine
english
gentleman
simmer
it
well
sweeten
just
to
your
own
private
liking
then
strain
that
only
the
finest
and
clearest
remain
let
it
stand
out
of
doors
till
a
soul
it
receives
from
the
warm
lazy
sun
loitering
down
through
green
leaves
and
you
find
a
choice
nature
not
wholly
deserving
a
name
either
english
or
yankee
just
irving
there
goes
but
nominis
his
name
you
be
glad
enough
some
day
or
other
to
claim
and
will
all
crowd
about
him
and
swear
that
you
knew
him
if
some
english
should
chance
to
review
him
the
old
ante
ne
for
him
you
have
verified
gratis
what
matters
his
name
why
it
may
be
sylvester
judd
junior
or
junius
ulysses
or
nestor
for
aught
know
or
care
is
enough
that
i
look
on
the
author
of
the
first
yankee
book
with
the
of
down
east
in
and
things
farther
east
as
far
as
the
threshold
of
morning
at
least
where
awaits
the
fair
dawn
of
the
simple
and
true
of
the
day
that
comes
slowly
to
make
all
things
new
has
a
smack
of
pine
woods
of
bare
field
and
bleak
hill
such
as
only
the
breed
of
the
mayflower
could
till
the
puritan
shown
in
it
tough
to
the
core
such
as
prayed
smiting
agag
on
red
marston
moor
with
an
unwilling
humor
by
the
drouth
in
brown
hollows
about
the
inhospitable
mouth
with
a
soul
full
of
poetry
though
it
has
qualms
about
finding
a
happiness
out
of
the
psalms
full
of
tenderness
too
though
it
shrinks
in
the
dark
under
the
coarse
shaggy
bark
that
sees
visions
knows
wrestlings
of
god
with
the
will
and
has
its
own
sinais
and
thunderings
still
here
forgive
me
apollo
i
cried
while
i
pour
my
heart
out
to
my
birthplace
o
loved
more
and
more
dear
baystate
from
whose
rocky
bosom
thy
sons
should
suck
milk
brave
such
as
runs
in
the
veins
of
old
graylock
who
is
it
that
dares
call
thee
peddler
a
soul
wrapt
in
and
shares
it
is
false
she
a
poet
i
see
as
i
write
along
the
far
railroad
the
glide
white
the
of
her
i
hear
the
swift
strokes
of
weary
my
ear
sledges
ring
upon
anvils
through
logs
the
saw
screams
blocks
swing
to
their
place
beetles
drive
home
the
beams
it
is
songs
such
as
these
that
she
croons
to
the
din
of
her
shuttles
year
out
and
year
in
while
from
earth
farthest
corner
there
comes
not
a
breeze
but
wafts
her
the
buzz
of
her
bees
what
tho
those
horn
hands
have
as
yet
found
small
time
for
painting
and
sculpture
and
music
and
rhyme
these
will
come
in
due
order
the
need
that
prest
sorest
was
to
vanquish
the
seasons
the
ocean
the
forest
to
bridle
and
harness
the
rivers
the
steam
making
that
whirl
her
this
tug
in
her
team
to
vassalize
old
tyrant
winter
and
make
him
delve
surlily
for
her
on
river
and
lake
when
this
new
world
was
parted
she
strove
not
to
shirk
her
lot
in
the
heirdom
the
tough
silent
work
the
ever
from
herakles
down
to
odin
the
earth
iron
sceptre
and
crown
yes
thou
dear
noble
mother
if
ever
men
praise
could
be
claimed
for
creating
heroical
lays
thou
hast
won
it
if
ever
the
laurel
divine
crowned
the
maker
and
builder
that
glory
is
thine
thy
songs
are
right
epic
they
tell
how
this
rude
of
our
earth
here
was
tamed
and
subdued
thou
hast
written
them
plain
on
the
face
of
the
planet
in
brave
deathless
letters
of
iron
and
granite
thou
hast
printed
them
deep
for
all
time
they
are
set
from
the
same
runic
and
alphabet
with
thy
stout
berkshire
hills
and
the
arms
of
thy
bay
they
are
staves
from
the
burly
old
mayflower
lay
if
the
drones
of
the
old
world
in
querulous
ease
ask
thy
art
and
thy
letters
point
proudly
to
these
or
if
they
deny
these
are
letters
and
art
toil
on
with
the
same
old
invincible
heart
thou
art
rearing
the
pedestal
and
grand
whereon
the
fair
shapes
of
the
artist
shall
stand
and
creating
through
labors
undaunted
and
long
the
theme
for
all
sculpture
and
painting
and
song
but
my
good
mother
baystate
wants
no
praise
of
mine
she
learned
from
mother
a
precept
divine
about
something
that
butters
no
parsnips
her
in
another
direction
lies
work
is
her
sport
though
she
curtsey
and
set
her
cap
straight
that
she
will
if
you
talk
about
plymouth
and
one
bunker
hill
dear
notable
goodwife
by
this
time
of
night
her
hearth
is
swept
clean
and
her
fire
burning
bright
and
she
sits
in
a
chair
of
home
plan
and
make
rocking
musing
much
all
the
while
as
she
darns
on
a
stocking
whether
turkeys
will
come
pretty
high
next
thanksgiving
whether
flour
be
so
dear
for
as
sure
as
she
living
she
will
use
then
whether
the
pig
by
this
time
ai
got
pretty
tolerable
big
and
whether
to
sell
it
outright
will
be
best
or
to
smoke
hams
and
shoulders
and
salt
down
the
rest
at
this
minute
she
swop
all
my
verses
ah
cruel
for
the
last
patent
stove
that
is
saving
of
fuel
so
i
just
let
apollo
go
on
for
his
phiz
shows
i
kept
him
awaiting
too
long
as
it
is
if
our
friend
there
who
seems
a
reporter
is
done
with
his
burst
of
emotion
why
will
go
on
said
apollo
some
smiled
and
indeed
i
must
own
there
was
something
sarcastic
perhaps
in
his
tone
there
holmes
who
is
matchless
among
you
for
wit
a
always
from
which
flit
the
electrical
tingles
of
hit
after
hit
in
long
poems
is
painful
sometimes
and
invites
a
thought
of
the
way
the
new
telegraph
writes
which
pricks
down
its
little
sharp
sentences
spitefully
as
if
you
got
more
than
you
title
to
rightfully
and
you
find
yourself
hoping
its
wild
father
lightning
would
flame
in
for
a
second
and
give
you
a
he
has
perfect
sway
of
what
call
a
sham
metre
but
many
admire
it
the
english
pentameter
and
campbell
i
think
wrote
most
commonly
worse
with
less
nerve
swing
and
fire
in
the
same
kind
of
verse
nor
achieved
aught
in
so
worthy
of
praise
as
the
tribute
of
holmes
to
the
grand
you
went
crazy
last
year
over
bulwer
new
timon
why
if
to
the
day
of
his
dying
should
rhyme
on
heaping
verses
on
verses
and
tomes
upon
tomes
he
could
reach
the
best
point
and
vigor
of
holmes
his
are
just
the
fine
hands
too
to
weave
you
a
lyric
full
of
fancy
fun
feeling
or
spiced
with
satyric
in
a
measure
so
kindly
you
doubt
if
the
toes
that
are
trodden
upon
are
your
own
or
your
foes
there
is
lowell
who
striving
parnassus
to
climb
with
a
whole
bale
of
tied
together
with
rhyme
he
might
get
on
alone
spite
of
brambles
and
boulders
but
he
ca
with
that
bundle
he
has
on
his
shoulders
the
top
of
the
hill
he
will
come
nigh
reaching
till
he
learns
the
distinction
singing
and
preaching
his
lyre
has
some
chords
that
would
ring
pretty
well
but
he
rather
by
half
make
a
drum
of
the
shell
and
rattle
away
till
he
old
as
methusalem
at
the
head
of
a
march
to
the
last
new
jerusalem
there
goes

whose
fanny

the
wickedness
out
that
gave
salt
to
the
true
one

a

though
i
hear
of
the
very
first
order
and
once
made
a
pun
on
the
words
soft
recorder
more
than
this
he
a
very
great
poet
i
told
and
has
had
his
works
published
in
crimson
and
gold
with
something
they
call
to
wit
like
those
with
which
chapman
obscured
holy
writ
e
which
are
said
to
illustrate
because
as
i
view
it
like
a

precisely
do
do
it
let
a
man
who
can
write
what
himself
understands
keep
clear
if
he
can
of
designing
men
hands
who
bury
the
sense
if
there
any
worth
having
and
then
very
honestly
call
it

but
to
quit
which
there
is
much
wit
in
halleck
better
i
doubt
not
than
all
he
has
written
in
his
verse
a
clear
glimpse
you
will
frequently
find
if
not
of
a
great
of
a
fortunate
mind
which
contrives
to
be
true
to
its
natural
loves
in
a
world
of
ledgers
and
stoves
when
his
heart
breaks
away
from
the
brokers
and
banks
and
kneels
in
its
own
private
shrine
to
give
thanks
there
a
genial
manliness
in
him
that
earns
our
sincerest
respect
read
for
instance
his
and
we
ca
but
regret
seek
excuse
where
we
may
that
so
much
of
a
man
has
been
peddled
away

rightly
called

as
all
must
admit

what
that

in

bulwers
and
scotts
and
in
short
the
american
each
charging
the
others
with
envies
and
jealousies
by
the
way
is
a
fact
that
displays
what
profusions
of
all
kinds
of
greatness
bless
free
institutions
that
while
the
old
world
has
produced
barely
eight
of

agree
to
call

that

we
do

not

there
are

such
as

who
without
being

might
stand
for
a
type
of

and
at
this

conclusion

arrive

not
forgetting
their

and

the

the

came
in

presented

from

stared

swelling
with

asking

nothing
daunted
replied
you
surprised
i
suppose
i
was
absent
so
long
but
your
godship
respecting
the
lilies
was
wrong
i
hunted
the

from

end

got
no
reward
but
vexation
and
bother
till
tossed
out
with

in

corner
to
wither
this
one
lily
i
found
and
made
haste
to
bring
hither
footnote
i
turn
back
now
to
page
goodness
only
knows
what
and
take
a
fresh
hold
on
the
thread
of
my
plot
did
he
think
i
had
given
him
a
book
to
review
i
ought
to
have
known
what
the
fellow
would
do
muttered
phœbus
aside
for
a
thistle
will
pass
beyond
doubt
for
the
queen
of
all
flowers
with
an
ass
he
has
chosen
in
just
the
same
way
as
he
choose
his
specimens
out
of
the
books
he
reviews
and
now
as
this
offers
an
excellent
text
i
give
some
brief
hints
on
criticism
next
so
musing
a
moment
he
turned
to
the
crowd
and
clearing
his
voice
spoke
as
follows
aloud
my
friends
in
the
happier
days
of
the
muse
we
were
luckily
free
from
such
things
as
reviews
then
naught
came
between
with
its
fog
to
make
clearer
the
heart
of
the
poet
to
that
of
his
hearer
then
the
poet
brought
heaven
to
the
people
and
they
felt
that
they
too
were
poets
in
hearing
his
lay
then
the
poet
was
prophet
the
past
in
his
soul
the
future
both
parts
of
one
whole
then
for
him
there
was
nothing
too
great
or
too
small
for
one
natural
deity
sanctified
all
then
the
bard
owned
no
clipper
and
meter
of
moods
save
the
spirit
of
silence
that
hovers
and
broods
the
seas
and
the
mountains
the
rivers
and
woods
he
asked
not
earth
verdict
forgetting
the
clods
his
soul
soared
and
sang
to
an
audience
of
gods
was
for
them
that
he
measured
the
thought
and
the
line
and
shaped
for
their
vision
the
perfect
design
with
as
glorious
a
foresight
a
balance
as
true
as
swung
out
the
worlds
in
the
infinite
blue
then
a
glory
and
greatness
invested
man
heart
the
universal
which
now
stands
estranged
and
apart
in
the
free
individual
moulded
was
art
then
the
forms
of
the
artist
seemed
thrilled
with
desire
for
something
as
yet
unattained
fuller
higher
as
once
with
her
lips
lifted
hands
and
eyes
listening
and
her
whole
upward
soul
in
her
countenance
glistening
eurydice
stood
like
a
beacon
unfired
which
once
touch
with
flame
will
leap
inspired
and
waited
with
answering
kindle
to
mark
the
first
gleam
of
orpheus
that
pained
the
red
dark
then
painting
song
sculpture
did
more
than
relieve
the
need
that
men
feel
to
create
and
believe
and
as
in
all
beauty
who
listens
with
love
hears
these
words
oft
repeated
and
above
so
these
seemed
to
be
but
the
visible
sign
of
the
grasp
of
the
soul
after
things
more
divine
they
were
ladders
the
artist
erected
to
climb
the
narrow
horizon
of
space
and
of
time
and
we
see
there
the
footsteps
by
which
men
had
gained
to
the
one
rapturous
glimpse
of
the
as
shepherds
could
erst
sometimes
trace
in
the
sod
the
last
spurning
print
of
a
god
but
now
on
the
poet
moods
with
and
the
pert
critic
intrudes
while
he
thinks
he
been
barely
fulfilling
his
duty
to
interpret
men
and
their
own
sense
of
beauty
and
has
striven
while
others
sought
honor
or
pelf
to
make
his
kind
happy
as
he
was
himself
he
finds
he
been
guilty
of
horrid
offences
in
all
kinds
of
moods
numbers
genders
and
tenses
he
been
and
what
kettle
calls
pot
precisely
at
all
events
what
he
ought
not
have
done
says
one
judge
says
another
should
have
done
grumbles
one
says
t
other
never
mind
what
he
touches
one
shrieks
out
and
while
he
is
wondering
what
he
shall
do
since
each
suggests
opposite
topics
for
song
they
all
shout
together
right
and
wrong
nature
fits
all
her
children
with
something
to
do
he
who
would
write
and
ca
write
can
surely
review
can
set
up
a
small
booth
as
critic
and
sell
us
his
petty
conceit
and
his
pettier
jealousies
thus
a
lawyer
apprentice
just
out
of
his
teens
will
do
for
the
jeffrey
of
six
magazines
having
read

lives
of

half
through
there
nothing
on
earth
he
not
competent
to
he
reviews
with
as
much
nonchalance
as
he
whistles
he
goes
through
a
book
and
just
picks
out
the
thistles
it
matters
not
whether
he
blame
or
commend
if
he
bad
as
a
foe
he
far
worse
as
a
friend
let
an
author
but
write
what
above
his
poor
scope
and
he
go
to
work
gravely
and
twist
up
a
rope
and
inviting
the
world
to
see
punishment
done
hang
himself
up
to
bleach
in
the
wind
and
the
sun
is
delightful
to
see
when
a
man
comes
along
who
has
anything
in
him
peculiar
and
strong
every
cockboat
that
swims
clear
its
fierce
pop
gundeck
at
him
and

as
he
passes
its
ludicrous
peck
at
him
here
miranda
came
up
and
began
as
to
that
apollo
at
once
seized
his
gloves
cane
and
hat
and
seeing
the
place
getting
rapidly
cleared
i
too
snatched
my
notes
and
forthwith
disappeared
the
biglow
papers
notices
of
an
independent
press
i
have
observed
reader
or
as
it
may
happen
that
it
is
customary
to
append
to
the
second
editions
of
books
and
to
the
second
works
of
authors
short
sentences
commendatory
of
the
first
under
the
title
of
of
the
these
i
have
been
given
to
understand
are
procurable
at
certain
established
rates
payment
being
made
either
in
money
or
advertising
patronage
by
the
publisher
or
by
an
adequate
outlay
of
servility
on
the
part
of
the
author
considering
these
things
with
myself
and
also
that
such
notices
are
neither
intended
nor
generally
believed
to
convey
any
real
opinions
being
a
purely
ceremonial
accompaniment
of
literature
and
resembling
certificates
to
the
virtues
of
various
morbiferal
panaceas
i
conceived
that
it
would
be
not
only
more
economical
to
prepare
a
sufficient
number
of
such
myself
but
also
more
immediately
subservient
to
the
end
in
view
to
prefix
them
to
this
our
primary
edition
rather
than
await
the
contingency
of
a
second
when
they
would
seem
to
be
of
small
utility
to
delay
attaching
the
until
the
second
attempt
at
flying
the
kite
would
indicate
but
a
slender
experience
in
that
useful
art
neither
has
it
escaped
my
notice
nor
failed
to
afford
me
matter
of
reflection
that
when
a
circus
or
a
caravan
is
about
to
visit
jaalam
the
initial
step
is
to
send
forward
large
and
highly
ornamented
bills
of
performance
to
be
hung
in
the
and
the
these
having
been
sufficiently
gazed
at
and
beginning
to
lose
their
attractiveness
except
for
the
flies
and
truly
the
boys
also
in
whom
i
find
it
impossible
to
repress
even
during
certain
oral
and
telegraphic
communications
concerning
the
expected
show
upon
some
fine
morning
the
band
enters
in
a
wagon
or
triumphal
chariot
and
with
noisy
advertisement
by
means
of
brass
wood
and
sheepskin
makes
the
circuit
of
our
startled
then
as
the
exciting
sounds
draw
nearer
and
nearer
do
i
desiderate
those
eyes
of
aristarchus
whose
looks
were
as
a
breeching
to
a
boy
then
do
i
perceive
with
vain
regret
of
wasted
opportunities
the
advantage
of
a
pancratic
or
pantechnic
education
since
he
is
most
reverenced
by
my
little
subjects
who
can
throw
the
cleanest
summerset
or
walk
most
securely
upon
the
revolving
cask
the
story
of
the
pied
piper
becomes
for
the
first
time
credible
to
me
albeit
confirmed
by
the
hameliners
dating
their
legal
instruments
from
the
period
of
his
exit
as
i
behold
how
those
strains
without
pretence
of
magical
potency
bewitch
the
pupillary
legs
nor
leave
to
the
pedagogic
an
entire
for
these
reasons
lest
my
kingly
prerogative
should
suffer
diminution
i
prorogue
my
restless
commons
whom
i
also
follow
into
the
street
chiefly
lest
some
mischief
may
chance
befall
them
after
the
manner
of
such
a
band
i
send
forward
the
following
notices
of
domestic
manufacture
to
make
brazen
proclamation
not
unconscious
of
the
advantage
which
will
accrue
if
our
little
craft
shall
seem
to
leave
port
with
a
clipping
breeze
and
to
carry
in
nautical
phrase
a
bone
in
her
mouth
nevertheless
i
have
chosen
as
being
more
equitable
to
prepare
some
also
sufficiently
objurgatory
that
readers
of
every
taste
may
find
a
dish
to
their
palate
i
have
modelled
them
upon
actually
existing
specimens
preserved
in
my
own
cabinet
of
natural
curiosities
one
in
particular
i
had
copied
with
tolerable
exactness
from
a
notice
of
one
of
my
own
discourses
which
from
its
superior
tone
and
appearance
of
vast
experience
i
concluded
to
have
been
written
by
a
man
at
least
three
hundred
years
of
age
though
i
recollected
no
existing
instance
of
such
antediluvian
longevity
nevertheless
i
afterwards
discovered
the
author
to
be
a
young
gentleman
preparing
for
the
ministry
under
the
direction
of
one
of
my
brethren
in
a
neighboring
town
and
whom
i
had
once
instinctively
corrected
in
a
latin
quantity
but
this
i
have
been
forced
to
omit
from
its
too
great
h
the
universal
littery
full
of
passages
which
rivet
the
attention
of
the
reader
under
a
rustic
garb
sentiments
are
conveyed
which
should
be
committed
to
the
memory
and
engraven
on
the
heart
of
every
moral
and
social
being
we
consider
this
a
performance
we
hope
to
see
it
soon
introduced
into
our
common
schools
wilbur
has
performed
his
duties
as
editor
with
excellent
taste
and
judgment
this
is
a
vein
which
we
hope
to
see
successfully
prosecuted
we
hail
the
appearance
of
this
work
as
a
long
stride
toward
the
formation
of
a
purely
aboriginal
indigenous
native
and
american
literature
we
rejoice
to
meet
with
an
author
national
enough
to
break
away
from
the
slavish
deference
too
common
among
us
to
english
grammar
and
orthography
where
all
is
so
good
we
are
at
a
loss
how
to
make
extracts
on
the
whole
we
may
call
it
a
volume
which
no
library
pretending
to
entire
completeness
should
fail
to
place
upon
its
shelves
the
higginbottomopolis
a
collection
of
the
merest
balderdash
and
doggerel
that
it
was
ever
our
bad
fortune
to
lay
eyes
on
the
author
is
a
vulgar
buffoon
and
the
editor
a
talkative
tedious
old
fool
we
use
strong
language
but
should
any
of
our
readers
peruse
the
book
from
which
calamity
heaven
preserve
them
they
will
find
reasons
for
it
thick
as
the
leaves
of
vallumbrozer
or
to
use
a
still
more
expressive
comparison
as
the
combined
heads
of
author
and
editor
the
work
is
wretchedly
got
up
we
should
like
to
know
how
much
was
pocketed
by
this
libeller
of
our
country
and
her
purest
patriots
the
oldfogrumville
we
have
not
had
time
to
do
more
than
glance
through
this
handsomely
printed
volume
but
the
name
of
its
respectable
editor
the
rev
wilbur
of
jaalam
will
afford
a
sufficient
guaranty
for
the
worth
of
its
contents
the
paper
is
white
the
type
clear
and
the
volume
of
a
convenient
and
attractive
size
in
reading
this
elegantly
executed
work
it
has
seemed
to
us
that
a
passage
or
two
might
have
been
retrenched
with
advantage
and
that
the
general
style
of
diction
was
susceptible
of
a
higher
polish
on
the
whole
we
may
safely
leave
the
ungrateful
task
of
criticism
to
the
reader
we
will
barely
suggest
that
in
volumes
intended
as
this
is
for
the
illustration
of
a
provincial
dialect
and
turns
of
expression
a
dash
of
humor
or
satire
might
be
thrown
in
with
advantage
the
work
is
admirably
got
up
this
work
will
form
an
appropriate
ornament
to
the
it
is
beautifully
printed
on
paper
of
an
excellent
quality
the
dekay
we
should
be
wanting
in
our
duty
as
the
conductor
of
that
tremendous
engine
a
public
press
as
an
american
and
as
a
man
did
we
allow
such
an
opportunity
as
is
presented
to
us
by
the
biglow
papers
to
pass
by
without
entering
our
earnest
protest
against
such
attempts
now
alas
too
common
at
demoralizing
the
public
sentiment
under
a
wretched
mask
of
stupid
drollery
slavery
war
the
social
glass
and
in
short
all
the
valuable
and
institutions
justly
dear
to
our
common
humanity
and
especially
to
republicans
are
made
the
butt
of
coarse
and
senseless
ribaldry
by
this
scribbler
it
is
time
that
the
respectable
and
religious
portion
of
our
community
should
be
aroused
to
the
alarming
inroads
of
foreign
jacobinism
and
infidelity
it
is
a
fearful
proof
of
the
nature
of
this
contagion
that
these
secret
stabs
at
religion
and
virtue
are
given
from
under
the
cloak
posteri
of
a
clergyman
it
is
a
mournful
spectacle
indeed
to
the
patriot
and
christian
to
see
liberality
and
new
ideas
falsely
so
called
they
are
as
old
as
eden
invading
the
sacred
precincts
of
the
pulpit
on
the
whole
we
consider
this
volume
as
one
of
the
first
shocking
results
which
we
predicted
would
spring
out
of
the
late
french
revolution
the
bungtown
copper
and
comprehensive
family
altogether
an
admirable
work
full
of
humor
boisterous
but
delicate
of
wit
withering
and
scorching
yet
combined
with
a
pathos
cool
as
morning
dew
of
satire
ponderous
as
the
mace
of
richard
yet
keen
as
the
scymitar
of
saladin
a
work
full
of
mischievous
as
puck
and
lightsome
as
ariel
we
know
not
whether
to
admire
most
the
genial
fresh
and
discursive
concinnity
of
the
author
or
his
playful
fancy
weird
imagination
and
compass
of
style
at
once
both
objective
and
subjective
we
might
indulge
in
some
criticisms
but
were
the
author
other
than
he
is
he
would
be
a
different
being
as
it
is
he
has
a
wonderful
which
flits
from
flower
to
flower
and
bears
the
reader
irresistibly
along
on
its
eagle
pinions
like
ganymede
to
the
highest
heaven
of
we
love
a
book
so
purely
objective
many
of
his
pictures
of
natural
scenery
have
an
extraordinary
subjective
clearness
and
fidelity
in
fine
we
consider
this
as
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
volumes
of
this
or
any
age
we
know
of
no
english
author
who
could
have
written
it
it
is
a
work
to
which
the
proud
genius
of
our
country
standing
with
one
foot
on
the
aroostook
and
the
other
on
the
rio
grande
and
holding
up
the
banner
amid
the
wreck
of
matter
and
the
crush
of
worlds
may
point
with
bewildering
scorn
of
the
punier
efforts
of
enslaved
europe
we
hope
soon
to
encounter
our
author
among
those
higher
walks
of
literature
in
which
he
is
evidently
capable
of
achieving
enduring
fame
already
we
should
be
inclined
to
assign
him
a
high
position
in
the
bright
galaxy
of
our
american
bards
the
saltriver
pilot
and
flag
of
a
volume
in
bad
grammar
and
worse
taste
while
the
pieces
here
collected
were
confined
to
their
appropriate
sphere
in
the
corners
of
obscure
newspapers
we
considered
them
wholly
beneath
contempt
but
as
the
author
has
chosen
to
come
forward
in
this
public
manner
he
must
expect
the
lash
he
so
richly
merits
contemptible
slanders
vilest
billingsgate
has
raked
all
the
gutters
of
our
language
the
most
pure
upright
and
consistent
politicians
not
safe
from
his
malignant
venom
general
cushing
comes
in
for
a
share
of
his
vile
calumnies
the
homer
wilbur
is
a
disgrace
to
his
cloth
the
speech
is
silver
silence
is
golden
no
utterance
more
orphic
than
this
while
therefore
as
highest
author
we
reverence
him
whose
works
continue
heroically
unwritten
we
have
also
our
hopeful
word
for
those
who
with
pen
from
wing
of
goose
or
seraph
record
the
thing
that
is
revealed
under
mask
of
quaintest
irony
we
detect
here
the
deep
nigh
shipwracked
soul
semiarticulate
but
ever
climbing
hopefully
toward
the
peaceful
summits
of
an
infinite
sorrow
yes
thou
poor
forlorn
hosea
with
hebrew
soul
in
thee
for
thee
also
this
life
of
ours
has
not
been
without
its
aspects
of
heavenliest
pity
and
laughingest
mirth
conceivable
enough
through
coarse
we
have
revelation
of
the
heart
that
is
in
him
bravely
he
grapples
with
the
as
it
presents
itself
to
him
uncombed
shaggy
careless
of
the
nicer
proprieties
inexpert
of
elegant
diction
yet
with
voice
audible
enough
to
whoso
hath
ears
up
there
on
the
gravelly
or
down
on
the
splashy
of
native
jaalam
to
this
soul
also
the
of
somewhat
has
unveiled
its
awful
front
if
not
œdipuses
and
electras
and
alcestices
then
in
god
name
birdofredum
sawins
these
also
shall
get
born
into
the
world
and
filch
if
so
need
a
zingali
subsistence
therein
these
lank
omnivorous
yankees
of
his
he
shall
paint
the
seen
since
the
unseen
will
not
sit
to
him
yet
in
him
also
are
and
iliads
and
and
divine
comedies
if
only
once
he
could
come
at
them
therein
lies
much
nay
all
for
what
truly
is
this
which
we
name
but
that
which
we
do
possess
glimpses
also
are
given
us
of
an
old
father
ezekiel
not
without
paternal
pride
as
is
the
wont
of
such
a
brown
old
man
of
the
geoponic
or
bucolic
species
we
fancy
perhaps
with
much
and
plentiful
memories
bidding
fair
in
good
time
to
become
the
oldest
inhabitant
after
such
hasty
apparition
he
vanishes
and
is
seen
no
more
of
rev
homer
wilbur
pastor
of
the
first
church
in
jaalam
we
have
small
care
to
speak
here
spare
touch
in
him
of
his
melesigenes
namesake
save
haply
the
blindness
a
tolerably
caliginose
nephelegeretous
elderly
gentleman
with
infinite
faculty
of
sermonizing
muscularized
by
long
practice
and
excellent
digestive
apparatus
and
for
the
rest
enough
and
with
small
private
illuminations
somewhat
tallowy
it
is
to
be
feared
of
his
own
to
him
there
pastor
of
the
first
church
in
jaalam
our
hosea
presents
himself
as
a
quite
inexplicable
a
rich
poverty
of
latin
and
greek
so
far
is
clear
enough
even
to
eyes
peering
myopic
through
editorial
spectacles
but
naught
farther
o
purblind
altogether
fuscous
there
are
things
in
him
incommunicable

it

old
bewildered

of

a
nemean
lion
fulvous
in
of
a
sufficiently
rare
it
may
be
supposed
has
got
whelped
among
the
sheep
already
he
stands
with
feet
clutching
the
ground
as
with
gathering
for
a
over
the
walls
of
thy
little
fold
in

name
go
not

him
with
that
flybite
crook
of
thine

thou
painful

thou
wilt

place
of

of

and
results
of
councils
gathered
to
thy
spiritual
fathers
with
much
latin
of
the
epitaphial
sort

too
shalt

but
on
him
the
eumenides
have
looked

a
talented
young
townsman
of
ours
recently
returned
from
a
continental
tour
and
who
is
already
favorably
known
to
our
readers
by
his
sprightly
letters
from
abroad
which
have
graced
our
columns
called
at
our
office
yesterday
we
learn
from
him
that
having
enjoyed
the
distinguished
privilege
while
in
germany
of
an
introduction
to
the
celebrated
von
humbug
he
took
the
opportunity
to
present
that
eminent
man
with
a
copy
of
the
biglow
papers
the
next
morning
he
received
the
following
note
which
he
has
kindly
furnished
us
for
publication
we
prefer
to
print
it
knowing
that
our
readers
will
readily
forgive
the
few
errors
into
which
the
illustrious
writer
has
fallen
through
ignorance
of
our
language
i
shall
also
now
especially
happy
starve
because
i
have
more
or
less
a
work
of
one
those
aboriginal
seen
in
which
i
have
so
deaf
an
interest
ever
taken
fullworthy
on
the
self
shelf
with
our
gottsched
to
be
upset
pardon
my
in
the
unpractice
he
also
sent
with
the
above
note
a
copy
of
his
famous
work
on
cosmetics
to
be
presented
to
biglow
but
this
was
taken
from
our
friend
by
the
english
officers
probably
through
a
petty
national
spite
no
doubt
it
has
by
this
time
found
its
way
into
the
british
museum
we
trust
this
outrage
will
be
exposed
in
all
our
american
papers
we
shall
do
our
best
to
bring
it
to
the
notice
of
the
state
department
our
numerous
readers
will
share
in
the
pleasure
we
experience
at
seeing
our
young
and
vigorous
national
literature
thus
encouragingly
patted
on
the
head
by
this
venerable
and
german
we
love
to
see
these
reciprocations
of
between
the
different
branches
of
the
great
race
the
following
genuine
notice
having
met
my
eye
i
gladly
insert
a
portion
of
it
here
the
more
especially
as
it
contains
one
of
biglow
poems
not
elsewhere
h
the
jaalam
independent
but
while
we
lament
to
see
our
young
townsman
thus
mingling
in
the
heated
contests
of
party
politics
we
think
we
detect
in
him
the
presence
of
talents
which
if
properly
directed
might
give
an
innocent
pleasure
to
many
as
a
proof
that
he
is
competent
to
the
production
of
other
kinds
of
poetry
we
copy
for
our
readers
a
short
fragment
of
a
pastoral
by
him

manuscript
of
which
was

us

note
to
it
will
not
have
escaped
the
attentive
eye
that
i
have
on
the
omitted
those
honorary
appendages
to
the
editorial
name
which
not
only
add
greatly
to
the
value
of
every
book
but
whet
and
exacerbate
the
appetite
of
the
reader
for
not
only
does
he
surmise
that
an
honorary
membership
of
literary
and
scientific
societies
implies
a
certain
amount
of
necessary
distinction
on
the
part
of
the
recipient
of
such
decorations
but
he
is
willing
to
trust
himself
more
entirely
to
an
author
who
writes
under
the
fearful
responsibility
of
involving
the
reputation
of
such
bodies
as
the
archœl
or
the
lit
et
scient
i
can
not
but
think
that
the
early
editions
of
shakspeare
and
milton
would
have
met
with
more
rapid
and
general
acceptance
but
for
the
barrenness
of
their
respective
and
i
believe
that
even
now
a
publisher
of
the
works
of
either
of
those
justly
distinguished
men
would
find
his
account
in
procuring
their
admission
to
the
membership
of
learned
bodies
on
the
continent
a
proceeding
no
whit
more
incongruous
than
the
reversal
of
the
judgment
against
socrates
when
he
was
already
more
than
twenty
centuries
beyond
the
reach
of
antidotes
and
when
his
memory
had
acquired
a
deserved
respectability
i
conceive
that
it
was
a
feeling
of
the
importance
of
this
precaution
which
induced
locke
to
style
himself
gent
on
the
of
his
essay
as
who
should
say
to
his
readers
that
they
could
receive
his
metaphysics
on
the
honor
of
a
gentleman
nevertheless
finding
that
without
descending
to
a
smaller
size
of
type
than
would
have
been
compatible
with
the
dignity
of
the
several
societies
to
be
named
i
could
not
compress
my
intended
list
within
the
limits
of
a
single
page
and
thinking
moreover
that
the
act
would
carry
with
it
an
air
of
decorous
modesty
i
have
chosen
to
take
the
reader
aside
as
it
were
into
my
private
closet
and
there
not
only
exhibit
to
him
the
diplomas
which
i
already
possess
but
also
to
furnish
him
with
a
prophetic
vision
of
those
which
i
may
without
undue
presumption
hope
for
as
not
beyond
the
reach
of
human
ambition
and
attainment
and
i
am
the
rather
induced
to
this
from
the
fact
that
my
name
has
been
unaccountably
dropped
from
the
last
triennial
catalogue
of
our
beloved
whether
this
is
to
be
attributed
to
the
difficulty
of
latinizing
any
of
those
honorary
adjuncts
with
a
complete
list
of
which
i
took
care
to
furnish
the
proper
persons
nearly
a
year
beforehand
or
whether
it
had
its
origin
in
any
more
culpable
motives
i
forbear
to
consider
in
this
place
the
matter
being
in
course
of
painful
investigation
but
however
this
may
be
i
felt
the
omission
the
more
keenly
as
i
had
in
expectation
of
the
new
catalogue
enriched
the
library
of
the
jaalam
athenæum
with
the
old
one
then
in
my
possession
by
which
means
it
has
come
about
that
my
children
will
be
deprived
of
a
winter
evening
amusement
in
looking
out
the
name
of
their
parent
in
that
distinguished
roll
those
harmless
innocents
had
at
least
committed
no
but
i
forbear
having
intrusted
my
reflections
and
animadversions
on
this
painful
topic
to
the
of
my
private
diary
intended
for
posthumous
publication
i
state
this
fact
here
in
order
that
certain
nameless
individuals
who
are
perhaps
overmuch
congratulating
themselves
on
my
silence
may
know
that
a
rod
is
in
pickle
which
the
vigorous
hand
of
a
justly
incensed
posterity
will
apply
to
their
memories
the
careful
reader
will
note
that
in
the
list
which
i
have
prepared
i
have
included
the
names
of
several
cisatlantic
societies
to
which
a
place
is
not
commonly
assigned
in
processions
of
this
nature
i
have
ventured
to
do
this
not
only
to
encourage
native
ambition
and
genius
but
also
because
i
have
never
been
able
to
perceive
in
what
way
distance
unless
we
suppose
them
at
the
end
of
a
lever
could
increase
the
weight
of
learned
bodies
as
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
extend
my
researches
among
such
stuffed
specimens
as
occasionally
reach
america
i
have
discovered
no
generic
difference
between
the
antipodal
and
the
sufficiently
common
in
our
own
immediate
neighborhood
yet
with
a
becoming
deference
to
the
popular
belief
that
distinctions
of
this
sort
are
enhanced
in
value
by
every
additional
mile
they
travel
i
have
intermixed
the
names
of
some
tolerably
distant
literary
and
other
associations
with
the
rest
i
add
here
also
an
advertisement
which
that
it
may
be
the
more
readily
understood
by
those
persons
especially
interested
therein
i
have
written
in
that
curtailed
and
otherwise
maltreated

introduction
when
more
than
three
years
ago
my
talented
young
parishioner
biglow
came
to
me
and
submitted
to
my
animadversions
the
first
of
his
poems
which
he
intended
to
commit
to
the
more
hazardous
trial
of
a
city
newspaper
it
never
so
much
as
entered
my
imagination
to
conceive
that
his
productions
would
ever
be
gathered
into
a
fair
volume
and
ushered
into
the
august
presence
of
the
reading
public
by
myself
so
little
are
we
mortals
able
to
predict
the
event
i
confess
that
there
is
to
me
a
quite
new
satisfaction
in
being
associated
though
only
as
sleeping
partner
in
a
book
which
can
stand
by
itself
in
an
independent
unity
on
the
shelves
of
libraries
for
there
is
always
this
drawback
from
the
pleasure
of
printing
a
sermon
that
whereas
the
queasy
stomach
of
this
generation
will
not
bear
a
discourse
long
enough
to
make
a
separate
volume
those
religious
and
children
those
samuels
if
i
may
call
them
so
of
the
brain
must
at
first
lie
buried
in
an
undistinguished
heap
and
then
get
such
resurrection
as
is
vouchsafed
to
them
with
a
score
of
others
in
a
cheap
binding
with
no
other
mark
of
distinction
than
the
word
printed
upon
the
back
far
be
it
from
me
to
claim
any
credit
for
the
quite
unexpected
popularity
which
i
am
pleased
to
find
these
bucolic
strains
have
attained
unto
if
i
know
myself
i
am
measurably
free
from
the
itch
of
vanity
yet
i
may
be
allowed
to
say
that
i
was
not
backward
to
recognize
in
them
a
certain
wild
puckery
acidulous
sometimes
even
verging
toward
that
point
which
in
our
rustic
phrase
is
termed
flavor
not
wholly
unpleasing
nor
unwholesome
to
palates
cloyed
with
the
sugariness
of
tamed
and
cultivated
fruit
it
may
be
also
that
some
touches
of
my
own
here
and
there
may
have
led
to
their
wider
acceptance
albeit
solely
from
my
larger
experience
of
literature
and
authorship
j
footnote

the
reader
curious
in
such
matters
may
refer
if
he
can
find
them
to
a
sermon
preached
on
the
anniversary
of
the
dark
day
an
artillery
election
sermon
a
discourse
on
the
late
eclipse
dorcas
a
funeral
sermon
on
the
death
of
madam
submit
tidd
relict
of
the
late
experience
tidd
i
was
at
first
inclined
to
discourage
biglow
attempts
as
knowing
that
the
desire
to
poetize
is
one
of
the
diseases
naturally
incident
to
adolescence
which
if
the
fitting
remedies
be
not
at
once
and
with
a
bold
hand
applied
may
become
chronic
and
render
one
who
might
else
have
become
in
due
time
an
ornament
of
the
social
circle
a
painful
object
even
to
nearest
friends
and
relatives
but
thinking
on
a
further
experience
that
there
was
a
germ
of
promise
in
him
which
required
only
culture
and
the
pulling
up
of
weeds
from
around
it
i
thought
it
best
to
set
before
him
the
acknowledged
examples
of
english
composition
in
verse
and
leave
the
rest
to
natural
emulation
with
this
view
i
accordingly
lent
him
some
volumes
of
pope
and
goldsmith
to
the
assiduous
study
of
which
he
promised
to
devote
his
evenings
not
long
afterward
he
brought
me
some
verses
written
upon
that
model
a
specimen
of
which
i
subjoin
having
changed
some
phrases
of
less
elegancy
and
a
few
rhymes
objectionable
to
the
cultivated
ear
the
poem
consisted
of
childish
reminiscences
and
the
sketches
which
follow
will
not
seem
destitute
of
truth
to
those
whose
fortunate
education
began
in
a
country
village
and
first
let
us
hang
up
his
charcoal
portrait
of
the
propt
on
the
marsh
a
dwelling
now
i
see
the
humble
of
my
a
b

where
urchins
each
behind
his
tire
waited
in
ranks
the
wished
command
to
fire
then
all
together
when
the
signal
came
discharged
their
against
the
dame
daughter
of
danaus
who
could
daily
pour
in
treacherous
pipkins
her
pierian
store
she
mid
the
volleyed
learning
firm
and
calm
patted
the
furloughed
ferule
on
her
palm
and
to
our
wonder
could
divine
at
once
who
flashed
the
pan
and
who
was
downright
dunce
there
young
devotion
learned
to
climb
with
ease
the
gnarly
limbs
of
scripture
and
he
was
most
commended
and
admired

soonest
to
the
topmost
twig
perspired
each
name
was
called
as
many
various
ways
as
pleased
the

ear
on
different
days
so
that
the
weather
or
the
ferule
stings
colds
in
the
head
or
fifty
other
things
transformed
the

there

as
it

her

any
tyro
found
a
name
too
tough
and
looked
at

enough
she
nerved
her
larynx
for
the
desperate
thing
and
cleared
the
syllables
at
a
spring
ah
dear
old
times
there
once
it
was
my
hap
perched
on
a
stool
to
wear
the
cap
from

i
sat
at

a
drone

envy

compulsory

rewards
of
merit
too
full
many
a

each
with
its
woodcut
and
its
moral
rhyme
and
pierced
hung
on
ribbons
gay
about
my
neck
to
be
restored
next
day
i
carried
home
rewards
as
shining
then
as
those
which
deck
the
lifelong
pains
of
men

redemanded
praise
with

how
did
his
hat
with
ardor
rapt
its
decorous
curve
to
every
rank
adapt
how
did
it
graduate
with
a
courtly
ease
the
whole
long
scale
of
social
differences
yet
so
gave
each
his
measure
running
none
thought
his

the

the

dropped

while
eager
argus
who
has
missed
all

the

of
his
condescending

comes
leaping

let
the

in

i
add
only
one
further
extract
which
will
possess
a
melancholy
interest
to
all
such
as
have
endeavored
to
glean
the
materials
of
revolutionary
history
from
the
lips
of
aged
persons
who
took
a
part
in
the
actual
making
of
it
and
finding
the
manufacture
profitable
continued
the
supply
in
an
adequate
proportion
to
the
demand
old
joe
is
gone
who
saw
hot
percy
goad
his
slow
artillery
up
the
concord
road
a
tale
which
grew
in
wonder
year
by
year
as
every
time
he
told
it
joe
drew
near
to
the
main
fight
till
faded
and
grown
gray
the
original
scene
to
bolder
tints
gave
way
then
joe
had
heard
the
foe
scared
beat
on
stove
drum
with
one
uncaptured
stick
and
ere
death
came
the
lengthening
tale
to
lop
himself
had
fired
and
seen
a
drop
had
joe
lived
long
enough
that
scrambling
fight
had
squared
more
nearly
with
his
sense
of
right
and
vanquished
percy
to
complete
the
tale
had
hammered
stone
for
life
in
concord
jail
i
do
not
know
that
the
foregoing
extracts
ought
not
to
be
called
my
own
rather
than
biglow
as
indeed
he
maintained
stoutly
that
my
file
had
left
nothing
of
his
in
them
i
should
not
perhaps
have
felt
entitled
to
take
so
great
liberties
with
them
had
i
not
more
than
suspected
an
hereditary
vein
of
poetry
in
myself
a
very
near
ancestor
having
written
a
latin
poem
in
the
harvard
on
the
accession
of
george
the
third
suffice
it
to
say
that
whether
not
satisfied
with
such
limited
approbation
as
i
could
conscientiously
bestow
or
from
a
sense
of
natural
inaptitude
certain
it
is
that
my
young
friend
could
never
be
induced
to
any
further
essays
in
this
kind
he
affirmed
that
it
was
to
him
like
writing
in
a
foreign
tongue
that
versification
was
like
the
regular
ticking
of
one
of
willard
clocks
in
which
one
could
fancy
after
long
listening
a
certain
kind
of
rhythm
or
tune
but
which
yet
was
only
a
after
all
and
that
he
had
never
seen
a
on
a
trellis
growing
so
fairly
or
in
forms
so
pleasing
to
his
eye
as
a
over
a
in
a
swamp
he
added
i
know
not
what
to
the
effect
that
the
would
only
be
the
more
disfigured
by
having
its
leaves
starched
and
ironed
out
and
that
so
he
called
him
hardly
looked
right
with
his
mane
and
tail
in
these
and
other
such
opinions
i
did
not
long
strive
to
eradicate
attributing
them
rather
to
a
defective
education
and
senses
untuned
by
too
long
familiarity
with
purely
natural
objects
than
to
a
perverted
moral
sense
i
was
the
more
inclined
to
this
leniency
since
sufficient
evidence
was
not
to
seek
that
his
verses
wanting
as
they
certainly
were
in
classic
polish
and
point
had
somehow
taken
hold
of
the
public
ear
in
a
surprising
manner
so
only
setting
him
right
as
to
the
quantity
of
the
proper
name
pegasus
i
left
him
to
follow
the
bent
of
his
natural
genius
yet
could
i
not
surrender
him
wholly
to
the
tutelage
of
the
pagan
which
literally
interpreted
signifies
village
muse
without
yet
a
further
effort
for
his
conversion
and
to
this
end
i
resolved
that
whatever
of
poetic
fire
yet
burned
in
myself
aided
by
the
assiduous
bellows
of
correct
models
should
be
put
in
requisition
accordingly
when
my
ingenious
young
parishioner
brought
to
my
study
a
copy
of
verses
which
he
had
written
touching
the
acquisition
of
territory
resulting
from
the
mexican
war
and
the
folly
of
leaving
the
question
of
slavery
or
freedom
to
the
adjudication
of
chance
i
did
myself
indite
a
short
fable
or
apologue
after
the
manner
of
gay
and
prior
to
the
end
that
he
might
see
how
easily
even
such
subjects
as
he
treated
of
were
capable
of
a
more
refined
style
and
more
elegant
expression
production

very

o
my

humble
attempt
was
in

and

and
i
print
it
here
i
sincerely
trust
out
of
no
vainglory
but
solely
with
the
hope
of
doing
good
leaving
the
matter
open
a
tale
by
homer
wilbur
two
brothers
once
an
pair
together
dwelt
no
matter
where
to
whom
an
uncle
sam
or
some
one
had
left
a
house
and
farm
in
common
the
two
in
principles
and
habits
were
different
as
rats
from
rabbits
stout
farmer
north
with
frugal
care
laid
up
provision
for
his
heir
not
scorning
with
hard
hands
to
scrape
acquaintance
with
his
lands
whatever
thing
he
had
to
do
he
did
and
made
it
pay
him
too
he
sold
his
waste
stone
by
the
pound
his
drains
made
spin
round
his
ice
in
he
sold
his
wood
brought
profit
when
was
cold
he
dug
and
delved
from
morn
till
night
strove
to
make
profit
square
with
right
lived
on
his
means
cut
no
great
dash
and
paid
his
debts
in
honest
cash
on
tother
hand
his
brother
south
lived
very
much
from
hand
to
mouth
played
gentleman
nursed
dainty
hands
borrowed
north
money
on
his
lands
and
culled
his
morals
and
his
graces
from
fights
and
races
his
sole
work
in
the
farming
line
was
keeping
droves
of
swine
which
brought
great
bothers
and
expenses
to
north
in
looking
after
fences
and
when
they
happened
to
break
through
cost
him
both
time
and
temper
too
for
south
insisted
it
was
plain
he
ought
to
drive
them
home
again
and
north
consented
to
the
work
because
he
loved
to
buy
cheap
pork
meanwhile
south
swine
increasing
fast
his
farm
became
too
small
at
last
so
having
thought
the
matter
over
and
feeling
bound
to
live
in
clover
and
never
pay
the
clover
worth
he
said
one
day
to
brother
north
our
families
are
both
increasing
and
though
we
labor
without
ceasing
our
produce
soon
will
be
too
scant
to
keep
our
children
out
of
want
they
who
wish
fortune
to
be
lasting
must
be
both
prudent
and
forecasting
we
soon
shall
need
more
land
a
lot
i
know
that
cheaply
can
be
you
lend
the
cash
i
buy
the
acres
and
we
be
equally
partakers
poor
north
whose
blood
gave
him
a
hankering
after
mud
wavered
a
moment
then
consented
and
when
the
cash
was
paid
repented
to
make
the
new
land
worth
a
pin
thought
he
it
must
be
all
fenced
in
for
if
south
swine
once
get
the
run
no
kind
of
farming
can
be
done
o
if
that
do
suit
the
other
side
is
best
we
instantly
divide
but
somehow
south
could
incline
this
way
or
that
to
run
the
line
and
always
found
some
new
pretence
setting
the
division
fence
at
last
he
said
for
peace
sake
liberal
concessions
i
will
make
though
i
believe
upon
my
soul
i
a
just
title
to
the
whole
i
make
an
offer
which
i
call
we
have
no
fence
at
all
then
both
of
us
we
choose
can
take
what
part
we
want
to
use
if
you
should
chance
to
need
it
first
pick
you
the
best
i
take
the
worst
agreed
cried
north
thought
he
this
fall
with
wheat
and
rye
i
sow
it
all
in
that
way
i
shall
get
the
start
and
south
may
whistle
for
his
part
so
thought
so
done
the
field
was
sown
and
winter
having
come
and
gone
sly
north
walked
blithely
forth
to
spy
the
progress
of
his
wheat
and
rye
heavens
what
a
sight
his
brother
swine
had
asked
themselves
all
out
to
dine
such
grunting
munching
rooting
shoving
the
soil
seemed
all
alive
and
moving
as
for
his
grain
such
work
they
made
o
he
could
spy
a
single
blade
o
off
in
a
rage
he
rushed
to
south
my
wheat
and
rye
grief
choked
his
mouth
pray
do
mind
me
said
south
but
plant
all
of
the
new
land
that
you
want
yes
but
your
hogs
cried
north
the
grain
wo
hurt
them
answered
south
again
but
they
destroy
my
grain
no
doubt
is
fortunate
you
found
it
out
misfortunes
teach
and
only
they
you
must
not
sow
it
in
their
way
nay
you
says
north
must
keep
them
out
did
i
create
them
with
a
snout
asked
south
demurely
as
agreed
the
land
is
open
to
your
seed
and
would
you
fain
prevent
my
pigs
from
running
there
their
harmless
rigs
god
knows
i
view
this
compromise
with
not
the
most
approving
eyes
i
gave
up
my
unquestioned
rights
for
sake
of
quiet
days
and
nights
i
offered
then
you
know
is
true
to
cut
the
piece
of
land
in
two
then
cut
it
now
growls
north
abate
your
heat
says
south
is
now
too
late
i
offered
you
the
rocky
corner
but
you
of
your
own
good
the
scorner
refused
to
take
it
i
am
sorry
no
doubt
you
might
have
found
a
quarry
perhaps
a
for
aught
i
know
containing
heaps
of
native
rhino
you
ca
expect
me
to
resign
my
right
but
where
quoth
north
are
mine
rights
says
tother
well
that
funny
bought
the
land
paid
the
money
that
answered
south
is
from
the
point
the
ownership
you
grant
is
joint
i
sure
my
only
hope
and
trust
is
not
law
so
much
as
abstract
justice
though
you
remember
was
agreed
that
so
and
so
consult
the
deed
objections
now
are
out
of
date
they
might
have
answered
once
but
fate
quashes
them
at
the
point
we
got
to
that
my
motto
so
saying
south
began
to
whistle
and
looked
as
obstinate
as
gristle
while
north
went
homeward
each
brown
paw
clenched
like
a
knot
of
natural
law
and
all
the
while
in
either
ear
heard
something
clicking
wondrous
clear
to
turn
now
to
other
matters
there
are
two
things
upon
which
it
would
seem
fitting
to
dilate
somewhat
more
largely
in
this
place
the
yankee
character
and
the
yankee
dialect
and
first
of
the
yankee
character
which
has
wanted
neither
open
maligners
nor
even
more
dangerous
enemies
in
the
persons
of
those
unskilful
painters
who
have
given
to
it
that
hardness
angularity
and
want
of
proper
perspective
which
in
truth
belonged
not
to
their
subject
but
to
their
own
niggard
and
unskilful
pencil
new
england
was
not
so
much
the
colony
of
a
mother
country
as
a
hagar
driven
forth
into
the
wilderness
the
little
band
which
came
hither
in
came
not
to
seek
gold
but
to
found
a
democracy
they
came
that
they
might
have
the
privilege
to
work
and
pray
to
sit
upon
hard
benches
and
listen
to
painful
preachers
as
long
as
they
would
yea
even
unto
if
the
spirit
so
willed
it
and
surely
if
the
greek
might
boast
his
thermopylæ
where
three
hundred
men
fell
in
resisting
the
persian
we
may
well
be
proud
of
our
plymouth
rock
where
a
handful
of
men
women
and
children
not
merely
faced
but
vanquished
winter
famine
the
wilderness
and
the
yet
more
invincible
that
drew
them
back
to
the
green
island
far
away
these
found
no
lotus
growing
upon
the
surly
shore
the
taste
of
which
could
make
them
forget
their
little
native
ithaca
nor
were
they
so
wanting
to
themselves
in
faith
as
to
burn
their
ship
but
could
see
the
fair
west
wind
belly
the
homeward
sail
and
then
turn
unrepining
to
grapple
with
the
terrible
unknown
as
want
was
the
prime
foe
these
hardy
exodists
had
to
fortress
themselves
against
so
it
is
little
wonder
if
that
traditional
feud
is
long
in
wearing
out

his
brain
is
his
capital
and

at
all
risks

him

so
anything
is
to
be

by
it
yet
after
all
thin
speculative
jonathan
is
more
like
the
englishman
of
two
centuries
ago
than
john
bull
himself
is
he
has
lost
somewhat
in
solidity
has
become
fluent
and
adaptable
but
more
of
the
original
groundwork
of
character
remains
he
feels
more
at
home
with
fulke
greville
herbert
of
cherbury
quarles
george
herbert
and
browne
than
with
his
modern
english
cousins
he
is
nearer
than
john
by
at
least
a
hundred
years
to
naseby
marston
moor
worcester
and
the
time
when
if
ever
there
were
true
englishmen
john
bull
has
suffered
the
idea
of
the
invisible
to
be
very
much
fattened
out
of
him
jonathan
is
conscious
still
that
he
lives
in
the
world
of
the
unseen
as
well
as
of
the
seen
to
move
john
you
must
make
your
fulcrum
of
solid
beef
and
pudding
an
abstract
idea
will
do
for
jonathan
to
the
indulgent
reader
my
friend
the
reverend
wilbur
having
been
seized
with
a
dangerous
fit
of
illness
before
this
introduction
had
passed
through
the
press
and
being
incapacitated
for
all
literary
exertion
sent
to
me
his
notes
memoranda
and
requested
me
to
fashion
them
into
some
shape
more
fitting
for
the
general
eye
this
owing
to
the
fragmentary
and
disjointed
state
of
his
manuscripts
i
have
felt
wholly
unable
to
do
yet
being
unwilling
that
the
reader
should
be
deprived
of
such
parts
of
his
lucubrations
as
seemed
more
finished
and
not
well
discerning
how
to
segregate
these
from
the
rest
i
have
concluded
to
send
them
all
to
the
press
precisely
as
they
are
of
a
church
in
bungtown
it
remains
to
speak
of
the
yankee
dialect
and
first
it
may
be
premised
in
a
general
way
that
any
one
much
read
in
the
writings
of
the
early
colonists
need
not
be
told
that
the
far
greater
share
of
the
words
and
phrases
now
esteemed
peculiar
to
new
england
and
local
there
were
brought
from
the
mother
country
a
person
familiar
with
the
dialect
of
certain
portions
of
massachusetts
will
not
fail
to
recognize
in
ordinary
discourse
many
words
now
noted
in
english
vocabularies
as
archaic
the
greater
part
of
which
were
in
common
use
about
the
time
of
the
king
james
translation
of
the
bible
shakspeare
stands
less
in
need
of
a
glossary
to
most
new
englanders
than
to
many
a
native
of
the
old
country
the
peculiarities
of
our
speech
however
are
rapidly
wearing
out
as
there
is
no
country
where
reading
is
so
universal
and
newspapers
are
so
multitudinous
so
no
phrase
remains
long
local
but
is
transplanted
in
the
to
every
remotest
corner
of
the
land
consequently
our
dialect
approaches
nearer
to
uniformity
than
that
of
any
other
nation
the
english
have
complained
of
us
for
coining
new
words
many
of
those
so
stigmatized
were
old
ones
by
them
forgotten
and
all
make
now
an
unquestioned
part
of
the
currency
wherever
english
is
spoken
undoubtedly
we
have
a
right
to
make
new
words
as
they
are
needed
by
the
fresh
aspects
under
which
life
presents
itself
here
in
the
new
world
and
indeed
wherever
a
language
is
alive
it
grows
it
might
be
questioned
whether
we
could
not
establish
a
stronger
title
to
the
ownership
of
the
english
tongue
than
the
themselves
here
past
all
question
is
to
be
its
great
home
and
centre
and
not
only
is
it
already
spoken
here
by
greater
numbers
but
with
a
higher
popular
average
of
correctness
than
in
britain
the
great
writers
of
it
too
we
might
claim
as
ours
were
ownership
to
be
settled
by
the
number
of
readers
and
lovers
as
regards
the
provincialisms
to
be
met
with
in
this
volume
i
may
say
that
the
reader
will
not
find
one
which
is
not
as
i
believe
either
native
or
imported
with
the
early
settlers
nor
one
which
i
have
not
with
my
own
ears
heard
in
familiar
use
in
the
metrical
portion
of
the
book
i
have
endeavored
to
adapt
the
spelling
as
nearly
as
possible
to
the
ordinary
mode
of
pronunciation
let
the
reader
who
deems
me
remember
this
caution
of
martial
recitas

fidentine
libellus

male
cum

esse
a
few
further
explanatory
remarks
will
not
be
impertinent
i
shall
barely
lay
down
a
few
general
rules
for
the
reader
guidance
the
genuine
yankee
never
gives
the
rough
sound
to
the
r
when
he
can
help
it
and
often
displays
considerable
ingenuity
in
avoiding
it
even
before
a
vowel
he
seldom
sounds
the
final
a
piece
of
if
we
consider
his
partiality
for
nasals
the
same
of
the
final
as
and
for
and
the
in
such
words
as
he
omits
altogether
in
regard
to
he
shows
some
inconsistency
sometimes
giving
a
close
and
obscure
sound
as
for
for
for
for
and
again
giving
it
the
broad
sound
it
has
in
as
for
to
the
sound
he
prefixes
an
hard
to
exemplify
otherwise
than
orally
the
following
passage
in
shakspeare

would
recite
thus

unable

i
thought
the
curious
reader
might
be
gratified
with
a
sight
of
the
editorial
effigies
and
here
a
choice
between
two
was
offered
the
one
a
profile
entirely
black
cut
by
doyle
the
other
a
portrait
painted
by
a
native
artist
of
much
promise
the
first
of
these
seemed
wanting
in
expression
and
in
the
second
a
slight
obliquity
of
the
visual
organs
has
been
heightened
perhaps
from
an
of
force
on
the
part
of
the
artist
into
too
close
an
approach
to
actual
this
slight
divergence
in
my
optical
apparatus
from
the
ordinary
model
however
i
may
have
been
taught
to
regard
it
in
the
light
of
a
mercy
rather
than
a
cross
since
it
enabled
me
to
give
as
much
of
directness
and
personal
application
to
my
discourses
as
met
the
wants
of
my
congregation
without
risk
of
offending
any
by
being
supposed
to
have
him
or
her
in
my
eye
as
the
saying
is
seemed
yet
to
wilbur
a
sufficient
objection
to
the
engraving
of
the
aforesaid
painting
we
read
of
many
who
either
absolutely
refused
to
allow
the
copying
of
their
features
as
especially
did
plotinus
and
agesilaus
among
the
ancients
not
to
mention
the
more
modern
instances
of
scioppius
palæottus
pinellus

γ
whether
any
of
our
national
peculiarities
may
be
traced
to
our
use
of
stoves
as
a
certain
closeness
of
the
lips
in
pronunciation
and
a
smothered
smoulderingness
of
disposition
seldom
roused

unrestrained
intercourse
with

conducive

thousands
o

the

conceive
to

that
individual
who
is
mentioned
in
the
book
of
job
going
to
and
fro
in
the
earth
and
walking
up
and
down
in
bishop
latimer
will
have
him
to
have
been
a
bishop
but
to
me
that
other
calling
would
appear
more
congenial
the
sect
of
cainites
is
not
yet
extinct
who
esteemed
the
of
adam
to
be
the
most
worthy
not
only
because
of
that
privilege
of
primogeniture
but
inasmuch
as
he
was
able
to
overcome
and
slay
his
younger
brother
that
was
a
wise
saying
of
the
famous
marquis
pescara
to
the
papal
legate
that
was
impossible
for
men
to
serve
mars
and
christ
at
the
same
yet
in
time
past
the
profession
of
arms
was
judged
to
be
ἐξοχήν
that
of
a
gentleman
nor
does
this
opinion
want
for
strenuous
upholders
even
in
our
day
must
we
suppose
then
that
the
profession
of
christianity
was
only
intended
for
losels
or
at
best
to
afford
an
opening
for
plebeian
ambition
or
shall
we
hold
with
that
nicely
metaphysical
pomeranian
captain
vratz
who
was
count
königsmark
chief
instrument
in
the
murder
of
thynne
that
the
scheme
of
salvation
has
been
arranged
with
an
especial
eye
to
the
necessities
of
the
upper
classes
and
that
god
would
consider
a
and
deal
with
him
suitably
to
the
condition
and
profession
he
had
placed
him
in
it
may
be
said

a
letter
from
hosea
biglow
to
the
hon
buckingham
editor
of
the
boston
courier
covering
a
letter
from
sawin
private
in
the
massachusetts
regiment
this
letter
of
sawin
was
not
originally
written
in
verse
biglow
thinking
it
peculiarly
susceptible
of
metrical
adornment
translated
it
so
to
speak
into
his
own
vernacular
tongue
this
is
not
the
time
to
consider
the
question
whether
rhyme
be
a
mode
of
expression
natural
to
the
human
race
if
leisure
from
other
and
more
important
avocations
be
granted
i
will
handle
the
matter
more
at
large
in
an
appendix
to
the
present
volume
in
this
place
i
will
barely
remark
that
i
have
sometimes
noticed
in
the
unlanguaged
prattlings
of
infants
a
fondness
for
alliteration
assonance
and
even
rhyme
in
which
natural
predisposition
we
may
trace
the
three
degrees
through
which
our
verse
rose
to
its
culmination
in
the
poetry
of
pope
i
would
not
be
understood
as
questioning
in
these
remarks
that
pious
theory
which
supposes
that
children
if
left
entirely
to
themselves
would
naturally
discourse
in
hebrew
for
this
the
authority
of
one
experiment
is
claimed
and
i
could
with
sir
thomas
browne
desire
its
establishment
inasmuch
as
the
acquirement
of
that
sacred
tongue
would
thereby
be
facilitated
i
am
aware
that
herodotus
states
the
conclusion
of
psammeticus
to
have
been
in
favor
of
a
dialect
of
the
phrygian
but
beside
the
chance
that
a
trial
of
this
importance
would
hardly
be
blessed
to
a
pagan
monarch
whose
only
motive
was
curiosity
we
have
on
the
hebrew
side
the
comparatively
recent
investigation
of
james
the
fourth
of
scotland
i
will
add
to
this
prefatory
remark
that
sawin
though
a
native
of
jaalam
has
never
been
a
stated
attendant
on
the
religious
exercises
of
my
congregation
i
consider
my
humble
efforts
prospered
in
that
not
one
of
my
sheep
hath
ever
indued
the
wolf
clothing
of
war
save
for
the
comparatively
innocent
diversion
of
a
militia
training
not
that
my
flock
are
backward
to
undergo
the
hardships
of
warfare
they
serve
cheerfully
in
the
great
army
which
fights
even
unto
death
aris
et
accoutred
with
the
spade
the
axe
the
plane
the
sledge
the
and
other
such
effectual
weapons
against
want
and
ignorance
and
unthrift
i
have
taught
them
under
god
to
esteem
our
human
institutions
as
but
tents
of
a
night
to
be
stricken
whenever
truth
puts
the
bugle
to
her
lips
and
sounds
a
march
to
the
heights
of
intelligence
and

those
have

indeed
when
hath
satan
been
to
seek
for
attorneys
who
have
maintained
that
our
late
inroad
upon
mexico
was
undertaken
not
so
much
for
the
avenging
of
any
national
quarrel
as
for
the
spreading
of
free
institutions
and
of
protestantism
vix
duabus
anticyris
medenda
verily
i
admire
that
no
pious
sergeant
among
these
new
crusaders
beheld
martin
luther
riding
at
the
front
of
the
host
upon
a
tamed
pontifical
bull
as
in
that
former
invasion
of
mexico
the
zealous
gomara
spawn
though
he
were
of
the
scarlet
woman
was
favored
with
a
vision
of
james
of
compostella
skewering
the
infidels
upon
his
apostolical
lance
we
read
also
that
richard
of
the
lion
heart
having
gone
to
palestine
on
a
similar
errand
of
mercy
was
divinely
encouraged
to
cut
the
throats
of
such
paynims
as
refused
to
swallow
the
bread
of
life
doubtless
that
they
might
be
thereafter
incapacitated
for
swallowing
the
filthy
gobbets
of
mahound
by
angels
of
heaven
who
cried
to
the
king
and
his
knights
tuez
tuez
providentially
using
the
french
tongue
as
being
the
only
one
understood
by
their
auditors
this
would
argue
for
the
pantoglottism
of
these
celestial
intelligences
while
on
the
other
hand
the
devil
cotton
mather
is
unversed
in
certain
of
the
indian
dialects
yet
must
he
be
a
semeiologist
the
most
expert
making
himself
intelligible
to
every
people
and
kindred
by
signs
no
other
discourse
indeed
being
needful
than
such
as
the
holds
with
his
finned
quarry
who
if
other
bait
be
wanting
can
by
a
bare
bit
of
white
rag
at
the
end
of
a
string
captivate
those
foolish
fishes
such
piscatorial
oratory
is
satan
cunning
in
before
one
he
trails
a
hat
and
feather
or
a
bare
feather
without
a
hat
before
another
a
presidential
chair
or
a
tidewaiter
stool
or
a
pulpit
in
the
city
no
matter
what
to
us
dangling
there
over
our
heads
they
seem
junkets
dropped
out
of
the
seventh
heaven
sops
dipped
in
nectar
but
once
in
our
mouths
they
are
all
one
bits
of
fuzzy
cotton
this
however
by
the
way
it
is
time
now
while
so
many
miracles
of
this
sort
vouched
by
eyewitnesses
have
encouraged
the
arms
of
papists
not
to
speak
of
echetlæus
at
marathon
and
those
whom
we
must
conclude
imps
of
the
pit
who
sundry
times
captained
the
pagan
roman
soldiery
it
is
strange
that
our
first
american
crusade
was
not
in
some
such
wise
also
signalized
yet
it
is
said
that
the
lord
hath
manifestly
prospered
our
armies
this
opens
the
question
whether
when
our
hands
are
strengthened
to
make
great
slaughter
of
our
enemies
it
be
absolutely
and
demonstratively
certain
that
this
might
is
added
to
us
from
above
or
whether
some
potentate
from
an
opposite
quarter
may
not
have
a
finger
in
it
as
there
are
few
pies
into
which
his
meddling
digits
are
not
thrust
would
the
sanctifier
and
of
the
seventh
day
have
assisted
in
a
victory
gained
on
the
sabbath
as
was
one
in
the
late
war
or
has
that
day
become
less
an
object
of
his
especial
care
since
the
year
when
so
manifest
a
providence
occurred
to
william
trowbridge
in
answer
to
whose
prayers
when
he
and
all
on
shipboard
with
him
were
starving
a
dolphin
was
sent
daily
which
was
enough
to
serve
only
on
they
still
catched
a
couple
and
on
the
they
could
catch
none
at
all
haply
they
might
have
been
permitted
by
way
of
mortification
to
take
some
few
sculpins
those
banes
of
the
angler
which
unseemly
fish
would
moreover
have
conveyed
to
them
a
symbolical
reproof
for
their
breach
of
the
day
being
known
in
the
rude
dialect
of
our
mariners
as
cod
it
has
been
a
refreshment
to
many
nice
consciences
to
know
that
our
chief
magistrate
would
not
regard
with
eyes
of
approval
the
by
many
esteemed
sinful
pastime
of
dancing
and
i
own
myself
to
be
so
far
of
that
mind
that
i
could
not
but
set
my
face
against
this
mexican
polka
though
danced
to
the
presidential
piping
with
a
gubernatorial
second
if
ever
the
country
should
be
seized
with
another
such
mania
propagandâ
i
think
it
would
be
wise
to
fill
our
bombshells
with
alternate
copies
of
the
cambridge
platform
and
the
articles
which
would
produce
a
mixture
of
the
highest
explosive
power
and
to
wrap
every
one
of
our
in
a
leaf
of
the
new
testament
the
reading
of
which
is
denied
to
those
who
sit
in
the
darkness
of
popery
those
iron
evangelists
would
thus
be
able
to
disseminate
vital
religion
and
gospel
truth
in
quarters
inaccessible
to
the
ordinary
missionary
i
have
seen
lads
unimpregnate
with
the
more
sublimated
punctiliousness
of
walton
secure
pickerel
taking
their
unwary
beneath
the
too
nigh
the
surface
with
a
gun
and
small
shot
why
not
then
since
gunpowder
was
unknown
in
the
time
of
the
apostles
not
to
enter
here
upon
the
question
whether
it
were
discovered
before
that
period
by
the
chinese
suit
our
metaphor
to
the
age
in
which
we
live
and
say
as
well
as
of
men
i
do
much
fear
that
we
shall
be
seized
now
and
then
with
a
protestant
fervor
as
long
as
we
have
neighbor
naboths
whose
wallowings
in
papistical
mire
excite
our
horror
in
exact
proportion
to
the
size
and
desirableness
of
their
vineyards
yet
i
rejoice
that
some
earnest
protestants
have
been
made
by
this
war
i
mean
those
who
protested
against
it
fewer
they
were
than
i
could
wish
for
one
might
imagine
america
to
have
been
colonized
by
a
tribe
of
those
nondescript
african
animals
the
so
difficult
a
word
is
no
to
us
all
there
is
some
malformation
or
defect
of
the
vocal
organs
which
either
prevents
our
uttering
it
at
all
or
gives
it
so
thick
a
pronunciation
as
to
be
unintelligible
a
mouth
filled
with
the
national
pudding
or
watering
in
expectation
thereof
is
wholly
incompetent
to
this
refractory
monosyllable
an
abject
and
herpetic
public
opinion
is
the
pope
the
for
us
to
protest
against
corde
and
by
what
college
of
cardinals
is
this
our
our
binder
and
looser
elected
very
like
by
the
sacred
conclave
of
tag
rag
and
bobtail
in
the
gracious
atmosphere

the
yet
it
is
of
this
that
we
must
all
be
puppets
this
thumps
the

the

this
wags
the
senator

this

what
scriptures
are
canonical
and
shuffles

into
the
apocrypha

to
that
sentence

this
unclean
spirit
is
skilful
to
assume
various
shapes

have
known
it
to
enter
my
own
study
and
nudge
my
elbow
of
a
saturday
under
the
semblance
of
a
wealthy
member
of
my
congregation
it
were
a
great
blessing
if
every
particular
of
what
in
the
sum
we
call
popular
sentiment
could
carry
about
the
name
of
its
manufacturer
stamped
legibly
upon

stab
under

that
pestilent
fallacy

no
iii
what
robinson
thinks
a
few
remarks
on
the
following
verses
will
not
be
out
of
place
the
satire
in
them
was
not
meant
to
have
any
personal
but
only
a
general
application
of
the
gentleman
upon
whose
letter
they
were
intended
as
a
commentary
biglow
had
never
heard
till
he
saw
the
letter
itself
the
position
of
the
satirist
is
oftentimes
one
which
he
would
not
have
chosen
had
the
election
been
left
to
himself
in
attacking
bad
principles
he
is
obliged
to
select
some
individual
who
has
made
himself
their
exponent
and
in
whom
they
are
impersonate
to
the
end
that
what
he
says
may
not
through
ambiguity
be
dissipated
in
for
what
says
seneca
iter
per
præcepta
breve
et
efficace
per
a
bad
principle
is
comparatively
harmless
while
it
continues
to
be
an
abstraction
nor
can
the
general
mind
comprehend
it
fully
till
it
is
printed
in
that
large
type
which
all
men
can
read
at
sight
namely
the
life
and
character
the
sayings
and
doings
of
particular
persons
it
is
one
of
the
cunningest
fetches
of
satan
that
he
never
exposes
himself
directly
to
our
arrows
but
still
dodging
behind
this
neighbor
or
that
acquaintance
compels
us
to
wound
him
through
them
if
at
all
he
holds
our
affections
as
hostages
the
while
he
patches
up
a
truce
with
our
conscience
meanwhile
let
us
not
forget
that
the
aim
of
the
true
satirist
is
not
to
be
severe
upon
persons
but
only
upon
falsehood
and
as
truth
and
falsehood
start
from
the
same
point
and
sometimes
even
go
along
together
for
a
little
way
his
business
is
to
follow
the
path
of
the
latter
after
it
diverges
and
to
show
her
floundering
in
the
bog
at
the
end
of
it
truth
is
quite
beyond
the
reach
of
satire
there
is
so
brave
a
simplicity
in
her
that
she
can
no
more
be
made
ridiculous
than
an
oak
or
a
pine
the
danger
of
the
satirist
is
that
continual
use
may
deaden
his
sensibility
to
the
force
of
language
he
becomes
more
and
more
liable
to
strike
harder
than
he
knows
or
intends
he
may
be
careful
to
put
on
his
and
yet
forget
that
the
older
they
grow
the
more
plainly
may
the
knuckles
inside
be
felt
moreover
in
the
heat
of
contest
the
eye
is
insensibly
drawn
to
the
crown
of
victory
whose
tawdry
tinsel
glitters
through
that
dust
of
the
ring
which
obscures
truth
wreath
of
simple
leaves
i
have
sometimes
thought
that
my
young
friend
biglow
needed
a
monitory
hand
laid
on
his
arm
sufflaminandus
i
have
never
thought
it
good
husbandry
to
water
the
tender
plants
of
reform
with
yet
where
so
much
is
to
do
in
the
beds
he
were
a
sorry
gardener
who
should
wage
a
whole
day
war
with
an
iron
scuffle
on
those
ill
weeds
that
make
the
of
life
unsightly
when
a
sprinkle
of
attic
salt
will
wither
them
up
ars
etiam
says
scaliger
and
truly
it
is
a
hard
thing
to
say
where
the
graceful
gentleness
of
the
lamb
merges
in
downright
sheepishness
we
may
conclude
with
worthy
and
wise
fuller
that
one
may
be
a
lamb
in
private
wrongs
but
in
hearing
general
affronts
to

are

the
attentive

will
doubtless
have
perceived
in
the
foregoing
poem
an
allusion
to
that
pernicious
sentiment
our
country
right
or
wrong
it
is
an
abuse
of
language
to
call
a
certain
portion
of
land
much
more
certain
personages
elevated
for
the
time
being
to
high
station
our
country
i
would
not
sever
nor
loosen
a
single
one
of
those
ties
by
which
we
are
united
to
the
spot
of
our
birth
nor
minish
by
a
tittle
the
respect
due
to
the
magistrate
i
love
our
own
bay
state
too
well
to
do
the
one
and
as
for
the
other
i
have
myself
for
nigh
forty
years
exercised
however
unworthily
the
function
of
justice
of
the
peace
having
been
called
thereto
by
the
unsolicited
kindness
of
that
most
excellent
man
and
upright
patriot
caleb
strong
fumus
igne
alieno
is
best
qualified
with
this
libertas
ibi
we
are
inhabitants
of
two
worlds
and
owe
a
double
but
not
a
divided
allegiance
in
virtue
of
our
clay
this
little
ball
of
earth
exacts
a
certain
loyalty
of
us
while
in
our
capacity
as
spirits
we
are
admitted
citizens
of
an
invisible
and
holier
fatherland
there
is
a
patriotism
of
the
soul
whose
claim
absolves
us
from
our
other
and
terrene
fealty
our
true
country
is
that
ideal
realm
which
we
represent
to
ourselves
under
the
names
of
religion
duty
and
the
like
our
terrestrial
organizations
are
but
approaches
to
so
fair
a
model
and
all
they
are
verily
traitors
who
resist
not
any
attempt
to
divert
them
from
this
their
original
intendment
when
therefore
one
would
have
us
to
fling
up
our
caps
and
shout
with
the
multitude
country
however
bounded
he
demands
of
us
that
we
sacrifice
the
larger
to
the
less
the
higher
to
the
lower
and
that
we
yield
to
the
imaginary
claims
of
a
few
acres
of
soil
our
duty
and
privilege
as
liegemen
of
truth
our
true
country
is
bounded
on
the
north
and
the
south
on
the
east
and
the
west
by
justice
and
when
she
oversteps
that
invisible
by
so
much
as
a
she
ceases
to
be
our
mother
and
chooses
rather
to
be
looked
upon
that
is
a
hard
choice
when
our
earthly
love
of
country
calls
upon
us
to
tread
one
path
and
our
duty
points
us
to
another
we
must
make
as
noble
and
becoming
an
election
as
did
penelope
between
icarius
and
ulysses
veiling
our
faces
we
must
take
silently
the
hand
of
duty
to
follow
her
shortly
after
the
publication
of
the
foregoing
poem
there
appeared
some
comments
upon
it
in
one
of
the
public
prints
which
seemed
to
call
for
animadversion
i
accordingly
addressed
to
buckingham
of
the
boston
courier
the
following
letter
november
the
editor
of
the
courier
calling
at
the
this
morning
our
worthy
and
efficient
postmaster
offered
for
my
perusal
a
paragraph
in
the
boston
morning
post
of
the
instant
wherein
certain
effusions
of
the
pastoral
muse
are
attributed
to
the
pen
of
james
russell
lowell
for
aught
i
know
or
can
affirm
to
the
contrary
this
lowell
may
be
a
very
deserving
person
and
a
youth
of
parts
though
i
have
seen
verses
of
his
which
i
could
never
rightly
understand
and
if
he
be
such
he
i
am
certain
as
well
as
i
would
be
free
from
any
proclivity
to
appropriate
to
himself
whatever
of
credit
or
discredit
may
honestly
belong
to
another
i
am
confident
that
in
penning
these
few
lines
i
am
only
forestalling
a
disclaimer
from
that
young
gentleman
whose
silence
hitherto
when
rumor
pointed
to
himward
has
excited
in
my
bosom
mingled
emotions
of
sorrow
and
surprise
well
may
my
young
parishioner
biglow
exclaim
with
the
poet
vos
non
vobis
though
in
saying
this
i
would
not
convey
the
impression
that
he
is
a
proficient
in
the
latin
tongue
the
tongue
i
might
add
of
a
horace
and
a
tully
does
not
employ
his
pen
i
can
safely
say
for
any
lucre
of
worldly
gain
or
to
be
exalted
by
the
carnal
plaudits
of
men
he
does
not
wait
upon
providence
for
mercies
and
in
his
heart
mean
but
i
should
esteem
myself
as
verily
deficient
in
my
duty
who
am
his
friend
and
in
some
unworthy
sort
his
spiritual
if
i
did
not
step
forward
to
claim
for
him
whatever
measure
of
applause
might
be
assigned
to
him
by
the
judicious
if
this
were
a
fitting
occasion
i
might
venture
here
a
brief
dissertation
touching
the
manner
and
kind
of
my
young
friend
poetry
but
i
dubitate
whether
this
abstruser
sort
of
speculation
though
enlivened
by
some
apposite
instances
from
aristophanes
would
sufficiently
interest
your
oppidan
readers
as
regards
their
satirical
tone
and
their
plainness
of
speech
i
will
only
say
that
in
my
pastoral
experience
i
have
found
that
the
loves
nothing
better
than
to
be
treated
as
a
religious
moral
and
intellectual
being
and
that
there
is
no
so
potent
as
ridicule
but
it
is
a
kind
of
weapon
that
must
have
a
button
of
on
the
point
of
it
the
productions
of
have
been
stigmatized
in
some
quarters
as
unpatriotic
but
i
can
vouch
that
he
loves
his
native
soil
with
that
hearty
though
discriminating
attachment
which
springs
from
an
intimate
social
intercourse
of
many
years
standing
in
the
ploughing
season
no
one
has
a
deeper
share
in
the
of
the
country
than
he
if
dean
swift
were
right
in
saying
that
he
who
makes
two
blades
of
grass
grow
where
one
grew
before
confers
a
greater
benefit
on
the
state
than
he
who
taketh
a
city
might
exhibit
a
fairer
claim
to
the
presidency
than
general
scott
himself
i
think
that
some
of
those
disinterested
lovers
of
the
democracy
whose
fingers
have
never
touched
anything
rougher
than
the
dollars
of
our
common
country
would
hesitate
to
compare
palms
with
him
it
would
do
your
heart
good
respected
sir
to
see
that
young
man
mow
he
cuts
a
cleaner
and
wider
swarth
than
any
in
this
town
but
it
is
time
for
me
to
be
at
my
post
it
is
very
clear
that
my
young
friend
shot
has
struck
the
lintel
for
the
post
is
shaken
amos
ix
the
editor
of
that
paper
is
a
strenuous
advocate
of
the
mexican
war
and
a
colonel
as
i
am
given
to
understand
i
presume
that
being
necessarily
absent
in
mexico
he
has
left
his
journal
in
some
less
judicious
hands
at
any
rate
the
post
has
been
too
swift
on
this
occasion
it
could
hardly
have
cited
a
more
incontrovertible
line
from
any
poem
than
that
which
it
has
selected
for
animadversion
namely
kind
o
thought
christ
went
agin
war
an
pillage
if
the
post
maintains
the
converse
of
this
proposition
it
can
hardly
be
considered
as
a
safe
for
the
moral
and
religious
portions
of
its
party
however
many
other
excellent
qualities
of
a
post
it
may
be
blessed
with
there
is
a
sign
in
london
on
which
is
painted
green
man
it
would
do
very
well
as
a
portrait
of
any
individual
who
would
support
so
unscriptural
a
thesis
as
regards
the
language
of
the
line
in
question
i
am
bold
to
say
that
he
who
readeth
the
hearts
of
men
will
not
account
any
dialect
unseemly
which
conveys
a
sound
and
pious
sentiment
i
could
wish
that
such
sentiments
were
more
common
however
uncouthly
expressed
saint
ambrose
affirms
that
a
why
not
then
a
spiritu
sancto
digest
also
this
of
baxter
plainest
words
are
the
most
profitable
oratory
in
the
weightiest
matters
when
the
paragraph
in
question
was
shown
to
biglow
the
only
part
of
it
which
seemed
to
give
him
any
dissatisfaction
was
that
which
classed
him
with
the
whig
party
he
says
that
if
resolutions
are
a
nourishing
kind
of
diet
that
party
must
be
in
a
very
hearty
and
flourishing
condition
for
that
they
have
quietly
eaten
more
good
ones
of
their
own
baking
than
he
could
have
conceived
to
be
possible
without
repletion
he
has
been
for
some
years
past
i
regret
to
say
an
ardent
opponent
of
those
sound
doctrines
of
protective
policy
which
form
so
prominent
a
portion
of
the
creed
of
that
party
i
confess
that
in
some
discussions
which
i
have
had
with
him
on
this
point
in
my
study
he
has
displayed
a
vein
of
obstinacy
which
i
had
not
hitherto
detected
in
his
composition
he
is
also
infected
in
no
small
measure
with
the
peculiar
notions
of
a
print
called
the
liberator
whose
heresies
i
take
every
proper
opportunity
of
combating
and
of
which
i
thank
god
i
have
never
read
a
single
line
i
did
not
see
mr
b
verses
until
they
appeared
in
print
and
there
is
certainly
one
thing
in
them
which
i
consider
highly
improper
i
allude
to
the
personal
references
to
myself
by
name
to
confer
notoriety
on
an
humble
individual
who
is
laboring
quietly
in
his
vocation
and
who
keeps
his
cloth
as
free
as
he
can
from
the
dust
of
the
political
arena
though
mihi
si
non
is
no
doubt
an
indecorum
the
sentiments
which
he
attributes
to
me
i
will
not
deny
to
be
mine
they
were
embodied
though
in
a
different
form
in
a
discourse
preached
upon
the
last
day
of
public
fasting
and
were
acceptable
to
my
entire
people
of
whatever
political
views
except
the
postmaster
who
dissented
i
observe
that
you
sometimes
devote
a
portion
of
your
paper
to
a
religious
summary
i
should
be
well
pleased
to
furnish
a
copy
of
my
discourse
for
insertion
in
this
department
of
your
instructive
journal
by
omitting
the
advertisements
it
might
easily
be
got
within
the
limits
of
a
single
number
and
i
venture
to
insure
you
the
sale
of
some
scores
of
copies
in
this
town
i
will
cheerfully
render
myself
responsible
for
ten
it
might
possibly
be
advantageous
to
issue
it
as
an
but
perhaps
you
will
not
esteem
it
an
object
and
i
will
not
press
it
my
offer
does
not
spring
from
any
weak
desire
of
seeing
my
name
in
print
for
i
can
enjoy
this
satisfaction
at
any
time
by
turning
to
the
triennial
catalogue
of
the
university
where
it
also
possesses
that
added
emphasis
of
italics
with
which
those
of
my
calling
are
distinguished
i
would
simply
add
that
i
continue
to
fit
ingenuous
youth
for
college
and
that
i
have
two
spacious
and
airy
sleeping
apartments
at
this
moment
unoccupied
terms
which
vary
according
to
the
circumstances
of
the
parents
may
be
known
on
application
to
me
by
letter
post
paid
in
all
cases
the
lad
will
be
expected
to
fetch
his
own
towels
this
rule
desires
me
to
add
has
no
exceptions
respectfully
your
obedient
servant
perhaps
the
last
paragraph
may
look
like
an
attempt
to
obtain
the
insertion
of
my
circular
gratuitously
if
it
should
appear
to
you
in
that
light
i
desire
that
you
would
erase
it
or
charge
for
it
at
the
usual
rates
and
deduct
the
amount
from
the
proceeds
in
your
hands
from
the
sale
of
my
discourse
when
it
shall
be
printed
my
circular
is
much
longer
and
more
explicit
and
will
be
forwarded
without
charge
to
any
who
may
desire
it
it
has
been
very
neatly
executed
on
a
letter
sheet
by
a
very
deserving
printer
who
attends
upon
my
ministry
and
is
a
creditable
specimen
of
the
typographic
art
i
have
one
hung
over
my
mantelpiece
in
a
neat
frame
where
it
makes
a
beautiful
and
appropriate
ornament
and
balances
the
profile
of
cut
with
her
toes
by
the
young
lady
born
without
arms
i
have
in
the
foregoing
letter
mentioned
general
scott
in
connection
with
the
presidency
because
i
have
been
given
to
understand
that
he
has
blown
to
pieces
and
otherwise
caused
to
be
destroyed
more
mexicans
than
any
other
commander
his
claim
would
therefore
be
deservedly
considered
the
strongest
until
accurate
returns
of
the
mexicans
killed
wounded
and
maimed
be
obtained
it
will
be
difficult
to
settle
these
nice
points
of
precedence
should
it
prove
that
any
other
officer
has
been
more
meritorious
and
destructive
than
general
and
has
thereby
rendered
himself
more
worthy
of
the
confidence
and
support
of
the
conservative
portion
of
our
community
i
shall
cheerfully
insert
his
name
instead
of
that
of
general
in
a
future
edition
it
may
be
thought
likewise
that
general
has
invalidated
his
claims
by
too
much
attention
to
the
decencies
of
apparel
and
the
habits
belonging
to
a
gentleman
these
abstruser
points
of
statesmanship
are
beyond
my
scope
i
wonder
not
that
successful
military
achievement
should
attract
the
admiration
of
the
multitude
rather
do
i
rejoice
with
wonder
to
behold
how
rapidly
this
sentiment
is
losing
its
hold
upon
the
popular
mind
it
is
related
of
thomas
warton
the
second
of
that
honored
name
who
held
the
office
of
poetry
professor
at
oxford
that
when
one
wished
to
find
him
being
absconded
as
was
his
wont
in
some
obscure
alehouse
he
was
counselled
to
traverse
the
city
with
a
drum
and
fife
the
sound
of
which
inspiring
music
would
be
sure
to
draw
the
doctor
from
his
retirement
into
the
street
we
are
all
more
or
less
bitten
with
this
martial
insanity
quâ
dulcedine
cunctos
i
confess
to
some
infection
of
that
itch
myself
when
i
see
a
maintaining
his
insecure
elevation
in
the
saddle
under
the
severe
fire
of
the
and
when
i
remember
that
some
military
enthusiasts
through
haste
inexperience
or
an
to
lend
reality
to
those
fictitious
combats
will
sometimes
discharge
their
ramrods
i
can
not
but
admire
while
i
deplore
the
mistaken
devotion
of
those
heroic
officers
insanivimus
i
was
myself
during
the
late
war
with
great
britain
chaplain
of
a
regiment
which
was
fortunately
never
called
to
active
military
duty
i
mention
this
circumstance
with
regret
rather
than
pride
had
i
been
summoned
to
actual
warfare
i
trust
that
i
might
have
been
strengthened
to
bear
myself
after
the
manner
of
that
reverend
father
in
our
new
england
israel
benjamin
colman
who
as
we
are
told
in
life
of
him
when
the
vessel
in
which
he
had
taken
passage
for
england
was
attacked
by
a
french
privateer
fought
like
a
philosopher
and
a
christian
and
prayed
all
the
while
he
charged
and
fired
as
this
note
is
already
long
i
shall
not
here
enter
upon
a
discussion
of
the
question
whether
christians
may
lawfully
be
soldiers
i
think
it
sufficiently
evident
that
during
the
first
two
centuries
of
the
christian
era
at
least
two
professions
were
esteemed
incompatible

the
ingenious

at
once
understand
that
no
such
speech
as
the

was
ever
pronounced
but
there
are
simpler
and
less

wits
for
the

of

such

be

for
there
are

lines
which
as

untruth

how
small
soever
there
is
moreover
a
truth
of
fiction
more
veracious
than
the
truth
of
fact
as
that
of
the
poet
which
represents
to
us
things
and
events
as
they
ought
to
be
rather
than
servilely
copies
them
as
they
are
imperfectly
imaged
in
the
crooked
and
smoky
glass
of
our
mundane
affairs
it
is
this
which
makes
the
speech
of
antonius
though
originally
spoken
in
no
wider
a
forum
than
the
brain
of
shakspeare
more
historically
valuable
than
that
other
which
appian
has
reported
by
as
much
as
the
understanding
of
the
englishman
was
more
comprehensive
than
that
of
the
alexandrian
biglow
in
the
present
instance
has
only
made
use
of
a
license
assumed
by
all
the
historians
of
antiquity
who
put
into
the
mouths
of
various
characters
such
words
as
seem
to
them
most
fitting
to
the
occasion
and
to
the
speaker
if
it
be
objected
that
no
such
oration
could
ever
have
been
delivered
i
answer
that
there
are
few
assemblages
for
which
do
not
better
deserve
the
title
of
than
did
the
sixth
parliament
of
henry
the
fourth
and
that
men
still
continue
to
have
as
much
faith
in
the
oracle
of
fools
as
ever
pantagruel
had
howell
in
his
letters
recounts
a
merry
tale
of
a
certain
ambassador
of
queen
elizabeth
who
having
written
two
letters
one
to
her
majesty
and
the
other
to
his
wife
directed
them
at
so
that
the
queen
was
beducked
and
bedeared
and
requested
to
send
a
change
of
hose
and
the
wife
was
beprincessed
and
otherwise
unwontedly
besuperlatived
till
the
one
feared
for
the
wits
of
her
ambassador
and
the
other
for
those
of
her
husband
in
like
manner
it
may
be
presumed
that
our
speaker
has
misdirected
some
of
his
thoughts
and
given
to
the
whole
theatre
what
he
would
have
wished
to
confide
only
to
a
select
auditory
at
the
back
of
the
curtain
for
it
is
seldom
that
we
can
get
any
frank
utterance
from
men
who
address
for
the
most
part
a
buncombe
either
in
this
world
or
the
next
as
for
their
audiences
it
may
be
truly
said
of
our
people
that
they
enjoy
one
political
institution
in
common
with
the
ancient
athenians
i
mean
a
certain
profitless
kind
of
wherewith
nevertheless
they
seem
hitherto
well
enough
content
for
in
presidential
elections
and
other
affairs
of
the
sort
whereas
i
observe
that
the
fall
to
the
lot
of
comparatively
few
the
such
as
the
privileges
of
voting
as
they
are
told
to
do
by
the
aforesaid
and
of
huzzaing
at
public
meetings
are
very
liberally
distributed
among
the
people
as
being
their
prescriptive
and
quite
sufficient
portion
the
occasion
of
the
speech
is
supposed
to
be
refusal
to
vote
for
the
whig
candidate
for
the

no

from
tully
who
in

recently
discovered
tractate
tells
us
vero
habere
virtutem
satis
est
quasi
artem
aliquam

and
from
our
milton
who
says
i
can
not
praise
a
fugitive
and
cloistered
virtue
unexercised
and
unbreathed
that
never
sallies
out
and
sees
her
adversary
but
slinks
out
of
the
race
where
that
immortal
garland
is
to
be
run
for
without
dust
and
he

taken
the

so

a
pest
i
sha
talk
with
my
religion
too
good
mornin
my
friends
i
your
most
humble
servant
into
the
question
whether
the
ability
to
express
ourselves
in
articulate
language
has
been
productive
of
more
good
or
evil
i
shall
not
here
enter
at
large
the
two
faculties
of
speech
and
of
are
wholly
diverse
in
their
natures
by
the
first
we
make
ourselves
intelligible
by
the
last
unintelligible
to
our
fellows
it
has
not
seldom
occurred
to
me
noting
how
in
our
national
legislature
every
thing
runs
to
talk
as
lettuces
if
the
season
or
the
soil
be
unpropitious
shoot
up
lankly
to
seed
instead
of
forming
handsome
heads
that
babel
was
the
first
congress
the
earliest
mill
erected
for
the
manufacture
of
gabble
in
these
days
what
with
town
meetings
school
committees
boards
lumber
of
one
kind
and
another
congresses
parliaments
diets
indian
councils
palavers
and
the
like
there
is
scarce
a
village
which
has
not
its
factories
of
this
description
driven
by
water
power
i
can
not
conceive
the
confusion
of
tongues
to
have
been
the
curse
of
babel
since
i
esteem
my
ignorance
of
other
languages
as
a
kind
of
in
which
i
am
safe
from
the
furious
bombardments
of
foreign
garrulity
for
this
reason
i
have
ever
preferred
the
study
of
the
dead
languages
those
primitive
formations
being
ararats
upon
whose
silent
peaks
i
sit
secure
and
watch
this
new
deluge
without
fear
though
it
rain
figures
semblances
of
speech
forty
days
and
nights
together
as
it
not
uncommonly
happens
thus
is
my
coat
as
it
were
without
buttons
by
which
any
but
a
vernacular
wild
bore
can
seize
me
is
it
not
possible
that
the
shakers
may
intend
to
convey
a
quiet
reproof
and
hint
in
fastening
their
outer
garments
with
hooks
and
eyes
this
reflection
concerning
babel
which
i
find
in
no
commentary
was
first
thrown
upon
my
mind
when
an
excellent
deacon
of
my
congregation
being
infected
with
the
second
advent
delusion
assured
me
that
he
had
received
a
first
instalment
of
the
gift
of
tongues
as
a
small
earnest
of
larger
possessions
in
the
like
kind
to
follow
for
of
a
truth
i
could
not
reconcile
it
with
my
ideas
of
the
divine
justice
and
mercy
that
the
single
wall
which
protected
people
of
other
languages
from
the
incursions
of
this
otherwise
propagandist
should
be
broken
down
in
reading
congressional
debates
i
have
fancied
that
after
the
subsidence
of
those
painful
buzzings
in
the
brain
which
result
from
such
exercises
i
detected
a
slender
residuum
of
valuable
information
i
made
the
discovery
that
takes
longer
in
the
saying
than
any
thing
else
for
as
nihilo
nihil
so
from
one
polypus
any
number
of
similar
ones
may
be
produced
i
would
recommend
to
the
attention
of
debaters
and
controversialists
the
admirable
example
of
the
monk
copres
who
in
the
fourth
century
stood
for
half
an
hour
in
the
midst
of
a
great
fire
and
thereby
silenced
a
manichæan
antagonist
who
had
less
of
the
salamander
in
him
as
for
those
who
quarrel
in
print
i
have
no
concern
with
them
here
since
the
eyelids
are
a
shield
against
all
such
moreover
i
have
observed
in
many
modern
books
that
the
printed
portion
is
becoming
gradually
smaller
and
the
number
of
blank
or
as
they
are
called
greater
should
this
fortunate
tendency
of
literature
continue
books
will
grow
more
valuable
from
year
to
year
and
the
whole
serbonian
bog
yield
to
the
advances
of
firm
arable
land
the
sagacious
lacedæmonians
hearing
that
tesephone
had
bragged
that
he
could
talk
all
day
long
on
any
given
subject
made
no
more
ado
but
forthwith
banished
him
whereby
they
supplied
him
a
topic
and
at
the
same
time
took
care
that
his
experiment
upon
it
should
be
tried
out
of
i
have
wondered
in
the
representatives
chamber
of
our
own
commonwealth
to
mark
how
little
impression
seemed
to
be
produced
by
that
emblematic
fish
suspended
over
the
heads
of
the
members
our
wiser
ancestors
no
doubt
hung
it
there
as
being
the
animal
which
the
pythagoreans
reverenced
for
its
silence
and
which
certainly
in
that
particular
does
not
so
well
merit
the
epithet
by
which
naturalists
distinguish
it
as
certain
bipeds
afflicted
with
on
the
brain
who
take
occasion
to
tap
themselves
in
fanueil
halls
and
other
places
of
public
h
no
the
debate
in
the
sennit
sot
to
a
nusry
rhyme
the
incident
which
gave
rise
to
the
debate
satirized
in
the
following
verses
was
the
unsuccessful
attempt
of
drayton
and
sayres
to
give
freedom
to
seventy
men
and
women
and
had
tripoli
instead
of
washington
been
the
scene
of
this
undertaking
the
unhappy
leaders
in
it
would
have
been
as
secure
of
the
theoretic
as
they
now
are
of
the
practical
part
of
martyrdom
i
question
whether
the
dey
of
tripoli
is
blessed
with
a
district
attorney
so
benighted
as
ours
at
the
seat
of
government
very
fitly
is
he
named
key
who
would
allow
himself
to
be
made
the
instrument
of
locking
the
door
of
hope
against
sufferers
in
such
a
cause
not
all
the
waters
of
the
ocean
can
cleanse
the
vile
smutch
of
the
jailer
fingers
from
off
that
little
key
a
brazen
key
indeed
calhoun
who
is
made
the
chief
speaker
in
this
burlesque
seems
to
think
that
the
light
of
the
nineteenth
century
is
to
be
put
out
as
soon
as
he
tinkles
his
little
curfew
whenever
slavery
is
touched
he
sets
up
his
scarecrow
of
dissolving
the
union
this
may
do
for
the
north
but
i
should
conjecture
that
something
more
than
a
is
required
to
scare
manifest
and
irretrievable
destiny
out
of
her
path
calhoun
can
not
let
go
the
of
the
past
the
past
is
a
good
nurse
but
we
must
be
weaned
from
her
sooner
or
later
even
though
like
plotinus
we
should
run
home
from
school
to
ask
the
breast
after
we
are
tolerably
youths
it
will
not
do
for
us
to
hide
our
faces
in
her
lap
whenever
the
strange
future
holds
out
her
arms
and
asks
us
to
come
to
her
but
we
are
all
alike
we
have
all
heard
it
said
often
enough
that
little
boys
must
not
play
with
fire
and
yet
if
the
matches
be
taken
away
from
us
and
put
out
of
reach
upon
the
shelf
we
must
needs
get
into
our
little
corner
and
scowl
and
stamp
and
threaten
the
dire
revenge
of
going
to
bed
without
our
supper
the
world
shall
stop
till
we
get
our
dangerous
plaything
again
dame
earth
meanwhile
who
has
more
than
enough
household
matters
to
mind
goes
bustling
hither
and
thither
as
a
hiss
or
a
sputter
tells
her
that
this
or
that
kettle
of
hers
is
boiling
over
and
before
bedtime
we
are
glad
to
eat
our
porridge
cold
and
gulp
down
our
dignity
along
with
it
calhoun
has
somehow
acquired
the
name
of
a
great
statesman
and
if
it
be
great
statesmanship
to
put
lance
in
rest
and
run
a
tilt
at
the
spirit
of
the
age
with
the
certainty
of
being
next
moment
hurled
neck
and
heels
into
the
dust
amid
universal
laughter
he
deserves
the
title
he
is
the
sir
kay
of
our
modern
chivalry
he
should
remember
the
old
scandinavian
mythus
thor
was
the
strongest
of
gods
but
he
could
not
wrestle
with
time
nor
so
much
as
lift
up
a
fold
of
the
great
snake
which
knit
the
universe
together
and
when
he
smote
the
earth
though
with
his
terrible
mallet
it
was
but
as
if
a
leaf
had
fallen
yet
all
the
while
it
seemed
to
thor
that
he
had
only
been
wrestling
with
an
old
woman
striving
to
lift
a
cat
and
striking
a
stupid
giant
on
the
head
and
in
old
times
doubtless
the
giants
stupid
and
there
was
no
better
sport
for
the
sir
launcelots
and
sir
gawains
than
to
go
about
cutting
off
their
great
blundering
heads
with
enchanted
swords
but
things
have
wonderfully
changed
it
is
the
giants
that
have
the
science
and
the
intelligence
while
the
chivalrous
don
quixotes
of
conservatism
still
cumber
themselves
with
the
clumsy
armor
of
a
age
on
whirls
the
restless
globe
through
unsounded
time
with
its
cities
and
its
silences
its
births
and
funerals
half
light
half
shade
but
never
wholly
dark

strictness
to
the
wealth
of
our
patriarchal
brethren
of

yet
it
is
clear
that
their
possessions
have
legs
and
an
unaccountable
propensity
for
using
them
in
a
northerly
direction
i
marvel
that
the
grand
jury
of
washington
did
not
find
a
true
bill
against
the

star
for
aiding

abetting

it
would
have
been
quite
of
a
piece
with
the
intelligence
displayed
by
the
south
on
other
questions
connected
with
slavery
i
think
that
no
ship
of
state
was
ever
freighted
with
a
more
veritable
jonah
than
this
same
domestic
institution
of
ours
mephistopheles
himself
could
not
feign
so
bitterly
so
satirically
sad
a
sight
as
this
of
three
millions
of
human
beings
crushed
beyond
help
or
hope
by
this
one
mighty
argument
fathers
knew
no
better
nevertheless
it
is
the
unavoidable
destiny
of
jonahs
to
be
cast
overboard
sooner
or
later
or
shall
we
try
the
experiment
of
hiding
our
jonah
in
a
safe
place
that
none
may
lay
hands
on
him
to
make
jetsam
of
him
let
us
then
with
equal
forethought
and
wisdom
lash
ourselves
to
the
anchor
and
await
in
pious
confidence
the
certain
result
perhaps
our
suspicious
passenger
is
no
jonah
after
all
being
black
for
it
is
well
known
that
a
superintending
providence
made
a
kind
of
sandwich
of
ham
and
his
descendants
to
be
devoured
by
the
caucasian
race
in
god
name
let
all
who
hear
nearer
and
nearer
the
hungry
moan
of
the
storm
and
the
growl
of
the
breakers
speak
out
but
alas
we
have
no
right
to
interfere
if
a
man
pluck
an
apple
of
mine
he
shall
be
in
danger
of
the
justice
but
if
he
steal
my
brother
i
must
be
silent
who
says
this
our
constitution
consecrated
by
the
callous
consuetude
of
sixty
years
and
grasped
in
triumphant
argument
by
the
left
hand
of
him
whose
right
hand
clutches
the
clotted
justice
venerable
with
the
undethronable
majesty
of
countless
æons
says
the
past
wise
with
the
sorrows
and
desolations
of
ages
from
amid
her
shattered
fanes
and
palaces
echoes
nature
through
her
thousand
trumpets
of
freedom
her
stars
her
sunrises
her
seas
her
winds
her
cataracts
her
mountains
blue
with
cloudy
pines
blows
jubilant
encouragement
and
cries
from
the
trembling
abysses
the
still
small
voice
not
vaguely
murmurs
but
alas
the
constitution
and
the
honorable
bagowind
say
it
occurs
to
me
to
suggest
as
a
topic
of
inquiry
in
this
connection
whether
on
that
momentous
occasion
when
the
goats
and
the
sheep
shall
be
parted
the
constitution
and
the
honorable
bagowind
will
be
expected
to
take
their
places
on
the
left
as
our
hircine
vicars
sum
miser
tunc
dicturus
quem
patronum
rogaturus
there
is
a
point
where
toleration
sinks
into
sheer
baseness
and
poltroonery
the
toleration
of
the
worst
leads
us
to
look
on
what
is
barely
better
as
good
enough
and
to
worship
what
is
only
moderately
good
woe
to
that
man
or
that
nation
to
whom
mediocrity
has
become
an
ideal
has
our
experiment
of
succeeded
if
it
barely
manage
to
and
here
now
is
a
piece
of
barbarism
which
christ
and
the
nineteenth
century
say
shall
cease
and
which
smith
brown
and
others
say
shall
cease
i
would
by
no
means
deny
the
eminent
respectability
of
these
gentlemen
but
i
confess
that
in
such
a
i
can
not
help
having
my
fears
for
them
justitiam
moniti
et
non
temnere
no
vi
the
pious
editor
creed
at
the
special
instance
of
biglow
i
preface
the
following
satire
with
an
extract
from
a
sermon
preached
during
the
past
summer
from
ezekiel
xxxiv
son
of
man
prophesy
against
the
shepherds
of
israel
since
the
sabbath
on
which
this
discourse
was
delivered
the
editor
of
the
jaalam
independent
blunderbuss
has
unaccountably
absented
himself
from
our
house
of
worship
i
know
of
no
so
responsible
position
as
that
of
the
public
journalist
the
editor
of
our
day
bears
the
same
relation
to
his
time
that
the
clerk
bore
to
the
age
before
the
invention
of
printing
indeed
the
position
which
he
holds
is
that
which
the
clergyman
should
hold
even
now
but
the
clergyman
chooses
to
walk
off
to
the
extreme
edge
of
the
world
and
to
throw
such
seed
as
he
has
clear
over
into
that
darkness
which
he
calls
the
next
life
as
if
did
not
mean
and
as
if
any
life
were
nearer
than
that
immediately
present
one
which
boils
and
eddies
all
around
him
at
the
caucus
the
ratification
meeting
and
the
polls
who
taught
him
to
exhort
men
to
prepare
for
eternity
as
for
some
future
era
of
which
the
present
forms
no
integral
part
the
furrow
which
time
is
even
now
turning
runs
through
the
everlasting
and
in
that
must
he
plant
or
nowhere
yet
he
would
fain
believe
and
teach
that
we
are
to
have
more
of
eternity
than
we
have
now
this
of
his
is
like
that
of
the
auctioneer
on
which
follows
before
we
have
made
up
our
minds
to
bid
in
which
manner
not
three
months
back
i
lost
an
excellent
copy
of
chappelow
on
job
so
it
has
come
to
pass
that
the
preacher
instead
of
being
a
living
force
has
faded
into
an
emblematic
figure
at
christenings
weddings
and
funerals
or
if
he
exercise
any
other
function
it
is
as
keeper
and
feeder
of
certain
theologic
dogmas
which
when
occasion
offers
he
unkennels
with
a
bark
and
bite
as
is
their
nature
to
whence
that
reproach
of
has
arisen
meanwhile
see
what
a
pulpit
the
editor
mounts
daily
sometimes
with
a
congregation
of
fifty
thousand
within
reach
of
his
voice
and
never
so
much
as
a
nodder
even
among
them
and
from
what
a
bible
can
he
choose
his
text
a
bible
which
needs
no
translation
and
which
no
priestcraft
can
shut
and
clasp
from
the
laity
the
open
volume
of
the
world
upon
which
with
a
pen
of
sunshine
or
destroying
fire
the
inspired
present
is
even
now
writing
the
annals
of
god
methinks
the
editor
who
should
understand
his
calling
and
be
equal
thereto
would
truly
deserve
that
title
of
ποιμὴν
λαῶν
which
homer
bestows
upon
princes
he
would
be
the
moses
of
our
nineteenth
century
and
whereas
the
old
sinai
silent
now
is
but
a
common
mountain
stared
at
by
the
elegant
tourist
and
crawled
over
by
the
hammering
geologist
he
must
find
his
tables
of
the
new
law
here
among
factories
and
cities
in
this
wilderness
of
sin
numbers
xxxiii
called
progress
of
civilization
and
be
the
captain
of
our
exodus
into
the
canaan
of
a
truer
social
order
nevertheless
our
editor
will
not
come
so
far
within
even
the
shadow
of
sinai
as
mahomet
did
but
chooses
rather
to
construe
moses
by
joe
smith
he
takes
up
the
crook
not
that
the
sheep
may
be
fed
but
that
he
may
never
want
a
warm
woollen
suit
and
a
joint
of
mutton
o
fidei
pecorumque
oblite
tuorum
for
which
reason
i
would
derive
the
name
not
so
much
from
to
publish
as
from
to
eat
that
being
the
peculiar
profession
to
which
he
esteems
himself
called
he
blows
up
the
flames
of
political
discord
for
no
other
occasion
than
that
he
may
thereby
handily
boil
his
own
pot
i
believe
there
are
two
thousand
of
these
shepherds
in
the
united
states
and
of
these
how
many
have
even
the
dimmest
perception
of
their
immense
power
and
the
duties
consequent
thereon
here
and
there

i
subjoin
here
another
passage
from
my
discourse
wonderful
to
him
that
has
eyes
to
see
it
rightly
is
the
newspaper
to
me
for
example
sitting
on
the
critical
front
bench
of
the
pit
in
my
study
here
in
jaalam
the
advent
of
my
weekly
journal
is
as
that
of
a
strolling
theatre
or
rather
of
a
on
whose
stage
narrow
as
it
is
the
tragedy
comedy
and
farce
of
life
are
played
in
little
behold
the
whole
huge
earth
sent
to
me
hebdomadally
in
a
wrapper
hither
to
my
obscure
corner
by
wind
or
steam
on
horseback
or
in
the
pouch
of
the
indian
runner
or
clicking
over
the
magnetic
wires
troop
all
the
famous
performers
from
the
four
quarters
of
the
globe
looked
at
from
a
point
of
criticism
tiny
puppets
they
seem
all
as
the
editor
sets
up
his
booth
upon
my
desk
and
officiates
as
showman
now
i
can
truly
see
how
little
and
transitory
is
life
the
earth
appears
almost
as
a
drop
of
vinegar
on
which
the
solar
microscope
of
the
imagination
must
be
brought
to
bear
in
order
to
make
out
anything
distinctly
that
animalcule
there
in
the
is
louis
philippe
just
landed
on
the
coast
of
england
that
other
in
the
gray
surtout
and
cocked
hat
is
napoleon
bonaparte
smith
assuring
france
that
she
need
apprehend
no
interference
from
him
in
the
present
alarming
juncture
at
that
spot
where
you
seem
to
see
a
speck
of
something
in
motion
is
an
immense
look
sharper
and
you
will
see
a
mite
brandishing
his
mandibles
in
an
excited
manner
that
is
the
great
soandso
defining
his
position
amid
tumultuous
and
irrepressible
cheers
that
infinitesimal
creature
upon
whom
some
score
of
others
as
minute
as
he
are
gazing
in
admiration
is
a
famous
philosopher
expounding
to
a
select
audience
their
capacity
for
the
infinite
that
scarce
discernible
pufflet
of
smoke
and
dust
is
a
revolution
that
speck
there
is
a
reformer
just
arranging
the
lever
with
which
he
is
to
move
the
world
and
lo
there
creeps
forward
the
shadow
of
a
skeleton
that
blows
one
breath
between
its
grinning
teeth
and
all
our
distinguished
actors
are
whisked
off
the
slippery
stage
into
the
dark
beyond
yes
the
little
has
its
solemner
suggestions
now
and
then
we
catch
a
glimpse
of
a
grim
old
man
who
lays
down
a
scythe
and
in
the
corner
while
he
shifts
the
scenes
there
too
in
the
dim
background
a
weird
shape
is
ever
delving
sometimes
he
leans
upon
his
mattock
and
gazes
as
a
coach
whirls
by
bearing
the
newly
married
on
their
wedding
jaunt
or
glances
carelessly
at
a
babe
brought
home
from
christening
suddenly
for
the
scene
grows
larger
and
larger
as
we
look
a
bony
hand
snatches
back
a
performer
in
the
midst
of
his
part
and
him
whom
yesterday
two
infinites
past
and
future
would
not
suffice
a
handful
of
dust
is
enough
to
cover
and
silence
forever
nay
we
see
the
same
fleshless
fingers
opening
to
clutch
the
showman
himself
and
guess
not
without
a
shudder
that
they
are
lying
in
wait
for
spectator
also
think
of
it
for
three
dollars
a
year
i
buy
a
to
this
great
globe
theatre
for
which
god
would
write
the
dramas
only
that
we
like
farces
spectacles
and
the
tragedies
of
apollyon
better
whose
is
time
and
whose
curtain
is
rung
down
by
death
such
thoughts
will
occur
to
me
sometimes
as
i
am
tearing
off
the
wrapper
of
my
newspaper
then
suddenly
that
otherwise
too
often
vacant
sheet
becomes
invested
for
me
with
a
strange
kind
of
awe
look
deaths
and
marriages
notices
of
inventions
discoveries
and
books
lists
of
promotions
of
killed
wounded
and
missing
news
of
fires
accidents
of
sudden
wealth
and
as
sudden
poverty
i
hold
in
my
hand
the
ends
of
myriad
invisible
electric
conductors
along
which
tremble
the
joys
sorrows
wrongs
triumphs
hopes
and
despairs
of
as
many
men
and
women
everywhere
so
that
upon
that
mood
of
mind
which
seems
to
isolate
me
from
mankind
as
a
spectator
of
their
another
supervenes
in
which
i
feel
that
i
too
unknown
and
unheard
of
am
yet
of
some
import
to
my
fellows
for
through
my
newspaper
here
do
not
families
take
pains
to
send
me
an
entire
stranger
news
of
a
death
among
them
are
not
here
two
who
would
have
me
know
of
their
marriage
and
strangest
of
all
is
not
this
singular
person
anxious
to
have
me
informed
that
he
has
received
a
fresh
supply
of
dimitry
bruisgins
but
to
none
of
us
does
the
president
continue
miraculous
even
if
for
a
moment
discerned
as
such
we
glance
carelessly
at
the
sunrise
and
get
used
to
orion
and
the
pleiades
the
wonder
wears
off
and
this
sheet
in
which
a
vision
was
let
down
to
me

be

the
desire
next
in
strength
to
this
an
opposite
pole
indeed
of
the
same
magnet
is
that
of
communicating
the
unintelligence
we
have
carefully
picked
up
men
in
general
may
be
divided
into
the
inquisitive
and
the
communicative
to
the
first
class
belong
peeping
toms
brahmins
metaphysicians
travellers
empedocleses
spies
the
various
societies
for
promoting
rhinothism
columbuses
yankees
discoverers
and
men
of
science
who
present
themselves
to
the
mind
as
so
many
marks
of
interrogation
wandering
up
and
down
the
world
or
sitting
in
studies
and
laboratories
the
second
class
i
should
again
subdivide
into
four
in
the
first
subdivision
i
would
rank
those
who
have
an
itch
to
tell
us
about
themselves
as
keepers
of
diaries
insignificant
persons
generally
montaignes
horace
walpoles
autobiographers
poets
the
second
includes
those
who
are
anxious
to
impart
information
concerning
other
people
as
historians
barbers
and
such
to
the
third
belong
those
who
labor
to
give
us
intelligence
about
nothing
at
all
as
novelists
political
orators
the
large
majority
of
authors
preachers
lecturers
and
the
like
in
the
fourth
come
those
who
are
communicative
from
motives
of
public
benevolence
as
finders
of
and
bringers
of
ill
news
each
of
us
fowls
without
feathers
embraces
all
these
subdivisions
in
himself
to
a
greater
or
less
degree
for
none
of
us
so
much
as
lays
an
egg
or
incubates
a
chalk
one
but
straightway
the
whole
shall
know
it
by
our
cackle
or
our
cluck
hoc
vitium
there
are
different
grades
in
all
these
classes
one
will
turn
his
telescope
toward
a
another
toward
uranus
one
will
tell
you
that
he
dined
with
smith
another
that
he
supped
with
plato
in
one
particular
all
men
may
be
considered
as
belonging
to
the
first
grand
division
inasmuch
as
they
all
seem
equally
desirous
of
discovering
the
mote
in
their
neighbor
eye
to
one
or
another
of
these
species
every
human
being
may
safely
be
referred
i
think
it
beyond
a
peradventure
that
jonah
prosecuted
some
inquiries
into
the
digestive
apparatus
of
whales
and
that
noah
sealed
up
a
letter
in
an
empty
bottle
that
news
in
regard
to
him
might
not
be
wanting
in
case
of
the
worst
they
had
else
been
super
or
subter
human
i
conceive
also
that
as
there
are
certain
persons
who
continually
peep
and
pry
at
the
keyhole
of
that
mysterious
door
through
which
sooner
or
later
we
all
make
our
exits
so
there
are
doubtless
ghosts
fidgetting
and
fretting
on
the
other
side
of
it
because
they
have
no
means
of
conveying
back
to
this
world
the
scraps
of
news
they
have
picked
up
in
that
for
there
is
an
answer
ready
somewhere
to
every
question
the
great
law
of
and
runs
through
all
nature
and
if
we
see
a
hook
we
may
be
sure
that
an
eye
is
waiting
for
it
i
read
in
every
face
i
meet
a
standing
advertisement
of
information
wanted
in
regard
to
a

the
friends
of

his
disadvantage
by
application
to
such

was

gratify
the
two
great
passions

asking

answering

of
epistles

which
are
of

kinds

letters
of
acceptance
and
letters
definitive
of
position
our
republic
on
the
eve
of
an
election
may
safely
enough
be
called
a
republic
of
letters
epistolary
composition
becomes
then
an
epidemic
which
seizes
one
candidate
after
another
not
seldom
cutting
short
the
thread
of
political
life
it
has
come
to
such
a
pass
that
a
party
dreads
less
the
attacks
of
its
opponents
than
a
letter
from
its
candidate
scripta
and
it
will
go
hard
if
something
bad
can
not
be
made
of
it
general
harrison
it
is
well
understood
was
surrounded
during
his
candidacy
with
the
of
a
vigilance
committee
no
prisoner
in
spielberg
was
ever
more
cautiously
deprived
of
writing
materials
the
soot
was
scraped
carefully
from
the
outposts
of
expert
rendered
it
sure
death
for
any
goose
who
came
clad
in
feathers
to
approach
within
a
certain
limited
distance
of
north
bend
and
all
domestic
fowls
about
the
premises
were
reduced
to
the
condition
of
plato
original
man
by
these
precautions
the
general
was
saved
componere
i
remember
that
when
once
ran
high
among
my
people
upon
occasion
of
the
choice
of
a
new
deacon
i
having
my
preferences
yet
not
caring
too
openly
to
express
them
made
use
of
an
innocent
fraud
to
bring
about
that
result
which
i
deemed
most
desirable
my
stratagem
was
no
other
than
the
throwing
a
copy
of
the
complete
in
the
way
of
the
candidate
whom
i
wished
to
defeat
he
caught
the
infection
and
addressed
a
short
note
to
his
constituents
in
which
the
opposite
party
detected
so
many
and
so
grave
improprieties
he
had
modelled
it
upon
the
letter
of
a
young
lady
accepting
a
proposal
of
marriage
that
he
not
only
lost
his
election
but
falling
under
a
suspicion
of
sabellianism
and
i
know
not
what
the
widow
endive
assured
me
that
he
was
a
paralipomenon
to
her
certain
knowledge
was
forced
to
leave
the
town
thus
it
is
that
the
letter
killeth
the
object
which
candidates
propose
to
themselves
in
writing
is
to
convey
no
meaning
at
all
and
here
is
a
quite
unsuspected
pitfall
into
which
they
successively
plunge
headlong
for
it
is
precisely
in
such
cryptographies
that
mankind
are
prone
to
seek
for
and
find
a
wonderful
amount
and
variety
of
significance
ignotum
pro
how
do
we
admire
at
the
antique
world
striving
to
crack
those
oracular
nuts
from
delphi
hammon
and
elsewhere
in
only
one
of
which
can
i
so
much
as
surmise
that
any
kernel
had
ever
lodged
that
namely
wherein
apollo
confessed
that
he
was
mortal
one
didymus
is
moreover
related
to
have
written
six
thousand
books
on
the
single
subject
of
grammar
a
topic
rendered
only
more
tenebrific
by
the
labors
of
his
successors
and
which
seems
still
to
possess
an
attraction
for
authors
in
proportion
as
they
can
make
nothing
of
it
a
singular
loadstone
for
theologians
also
is
the
beast
in
the
apocalypse
whereof
in
the
course
of
my
studies
i
have
noted
two
hundred
and
three
several
interpretations
each
lethiferal
to
all
the
rest
nostrum
est
tantas
componere
yet
i
have
myself
ventured
upon
a
two
hundred
and
fourth
which
i
embodied
in
a
discourse
preached
on
occasion
of
the
demise
of
the
late
usurper
napoleon
bonaparte
and
which
quieted
in
a
large
measure
the
minds
of
my
people
it
is
true
that
my
views
on
this
important
point
were
ardently
controverted
by
shearjashub
holden
the
then
preceptor
of
our
academy
and
in
other
particulars
a
very
deserving
and
sensible
young
man
though
possessing
a
somewhat
limited
knowledge
of
the
greek
tongue
but
his
heresy
struck
down
no
deep
root
and
he
having
been
lately
removed
by
the
hand
of
providence
i
had
the
satisfaction
of
reaffirming
my
cherished
sentiments
in
a
sermon
preached
upon
the
lord
day
immediately
succeeding
his
funeral
this
might
seem
like
taking
an
unfair
advantage
did
i
not
add
that
he
had
made
provision
in
his
last
will
being
celibate
for
the
publication
of
a
posthumous
tractate
in
support
of
his
own
dangerous
opinions
i
know
of
nothing
in
our
modern
times
which
approaches
so
nearly
to
the
ancient
oracle
as
the
letter
of
a
presidential
candidate
now
among
the
greeks
the
eating
of
beans
was
strictly
forbidden
to
all
such
as
had
it
in
mind
to
consult
those
expert
amphibologists
and
this
same
prohibition
on
the
part
of
pythagoras
to
his
disciples
is
understood
to
imply
an
abstinence
from
politics
beans
having
been
used
as
ballots
that
other
explication
videlicet
sensus
eo
cibo
obtundi
though
supported
et
by
many
of
the
learned
and
not
wanting
the
countenance
of
cicero
is
confuted
by
the
larger
experience
of
new
england
on
the
whole
i
think
it
safer
to
apply
here
the
rule
of
interpretation
which
now
generally
obtains
in
regard
to
antique
cosmogonies
myths
fables
proverbial
expressions
and
knotty
points
generally
which
is
to
find
a
meaning
and
then
select
whatever
can
be
imagined
the
most
opposite
thereto
in
this
way
we
arrive
at
the
conclusion
that
the
greeks
objected
to
the
questioning
of
candidates
and
very
properly
if
as
i
conceive
the
chief
point
be
not
to
discover
what
a
person
in
that
position
is
or
what
he
will
do
but
whether
he
can
be
elected
exemplaria
græca
nocturna
versate
manu
versate
but
since
an
imitation
of
the
greeks
in
this
particular
the
asking
of
questions
being
one
chief
privilege
of
freemen
is
hardly
to
be
hoped
for
and
our
candidates
will
answer
whether
they
are
questioned
or
not
i
would
recommend
that
these
dialogues
should
be
carried
on
by
symbols
as
were
the
diplomatic
correspondences
of
the
scythians
and
macrobii
or
confined
to
the
language
of
signs
like
the
famous
interview
of
panurge
and
goatsnose
a
candidate
might
then
convey
a
suitable
reply
to
all
committees
of
inquiry
by
closing
one
eye
or
by
presenting
them
with
a
phial
of
egyptian
darkness
to
be
speculated
upon
by
their
respective
constituencies
these
answers
would
be
susceptible
of
whatever
retrospective
construction
the
exigencies
of
the
political
campaign
might
seem
to
demand
and
the
candidate
could
take
his
position
on
either
side
of
the
fence
with
entire
consistency
or
if
letters
must
be
written
profitable
use
might
be
made
of
the
dighton
rock
hieroglyphic
or
the
cuneiform
script
every
fresh
decipherer
of
which

a
second
letter
from
sawin
esq
in
the
following
epistle
we
behold
sawin
returning
a
to
the
bosom
of
his
family
mutatus
the
good
father
of
us
all
had
doubtless
intrusted
to
the
keeping
of
this
child
of
his
certain
faculties
of
a
constructive
kind
he
had
put
in
him
a
share
of
that
vital
force
the
nicest
economy
of
every
minute
atom
of
which
is
necessary
to
the
perfect
development
of
humanity
he
had
given
him
a
brain
and
heart
and
so
had
equipped
his
soul
with
the
two
strong
wings
of
knowledge
and
love
whereby
it
can
mount
to
hang
its
nest
under
the
eaves
of
heaven
and
this
child
so
dowered
he
had
intrusted
to
the
keeping
of
his
vicar
the
state
how
stands
the
account
of
that
stewardship
the
state
or
society
call
her
by
what
name
you
will
had
taken
no
manner
of
thought
of
him
till
she
saw
him
swept
out
into
the
street
the
pitiful
leavings
of
last
night
debauch
with
slops
vile
stenches
and
the
whole
loathsome
of
the
an
own
child
of
the
almighty
god
i
remember
him
as
he
was
brought
to
be
christened
a
ruddy
rugged
babe
and
now
there
he
wallows
reeking
seething
the
dead
corpse
not
of
a
man
but
of
a
soul
a
putrefying
lump
horrible
for
the
life
that
is
in
it
comes
the
wind
of
heaven
that
good
samaritan
and
parts
the
hair
upon
his
forehead
nor
is
too
nice
to
kiss
those
parched
cracked
lips
the
morning
opens
upon
him
her
eyes
full
of
pitying
sunshine
the
sky
yearns
down
to
him
and
there
he
lies
fermenting
o
sleep
let
me
not
profane
thy
holy
name
by
calling
that
stertorous
unconsciousness
a
slumber
by
and
by
comes
along
the
state
god
vicar
does
she
say
my
poor
forlorn
behold
here
a
force
which
i
will
make
dig
and
plant
and
build
for
me
not
so
but
here
is
a
recruit
to
my
hand
a
piece
of
destroying
energy
lying
unprofitably
idle
so
she
claps
an
ugly
gray
suit
on
him
puts
a
musket
in
his
grasp
and
sends
him
off
with
gubernatorial
and
other
godspeeds
to
do
duty
as
a
destroyer
i
made
one
of
the
crowd
at
the
last
mechanics
fair
and
with
the
rest
stood
gazing
in
wonder
at
a
perfect
machine
with
its
soul
of
fire
its
that
sent
the
hot
blood
pulsing
along
the
iron
arteries
and
its
thews
of
steel
and
while
i
was
admiring
the
adaptation
of
means
to
end
the
harmonious
involutions
of
contrivance
and
the
complexity
i
saw
a
grimed
and
greasy
fellow
the
imperious
engine
lackey
and
drudge
whose
sole
office
was
to
let
fall
at
intervals
a
drop
or
two
of
oil
upon
a
certain
joint
then
my
soul
said
within
me
see
there
a
piece
of
mechanism
to
which
that
other
you
marvel
at
is
but
as
the
rude
first
effort
of
a
child
a
force
which
not
merely
suffices
to
set
a
few
wheels
in
motion
but
which
can
send
an
impulse
all
through
the
infinite
future
a
contrivance
not
for
turning
out
pins
or
stitching
but
for
making
hamlets
and
lears
and
yet
this
thing
of
iron
shall
be
housed
waited
on
guarded
from
rust
and
dust
and
it
shall
be
a
crime
but
so
much
as
to
scratch
it
with
a
pin
while
the
other
with
its
fire
of
god
in
it
shall
be
buffeted
hither
and
thither
and
finally
sent
carefully
a
thousand
miles
to
be
the
target
for
a
mexican
unthrifty
mother
state
my
heart
burned
within
me
for
pity
and
indignation
and
i
renewed
this
covenant
with
my
own
soul
aliis
mansuetus
ero
at

contra

spose

that
providence
by
the
creation
of

have
simplified
wonderfully
the
sometimes
perplexing
problem
of
human
life
we
read
of
the

which

we
are
assured
of

and
stout

and
i
have
seen
in
the

of
the

a
fair
show
of
fruit
a
i
once
cultivated
myself
and
found
therefrom
but
a
scanty
yield
and
that
quite
tasteless
and
innutritious
of
trees
bearing
men
we
are
not
without
examples
as
those
in
the
park
of
louis
the
eleventh
of
france
who
has
forgotten
moreover
that
growing
in
the
athenian
with
its
strange
uxorious
crop
for
the
general
propagation
of
which
as
of
a
new
and
precious
variety
the
philosopher
diogenes
hitherto
uninterested
in
arboriculture
was
so
zealous
in
the
of
our
own
southern
states
the
females
of
my
family
have
called
my
attention
to
the
not
to
multiply
examples
i
will
barely
add
to
my
list
the
in
the
smaller
branches
of
which
has
been
implanted
so
miraculous
a
virtue
for
communicating
the
latin
and
greek
languages
and
which
may
well
therefore
be
classed
among
the
trees
producing
necessaries
of
life
donum
fatalis
that
existed
in
the
golden
age
there
want
not
prevalent
reasons
for
our
believing
for
does
not
the
old
proverb
when
it
asserts
that
money
does
not
grow
on
bush
imply
that
there
were
certain
bushes
which
did
produce
it
again
there
is
another
ancient
saw
to
the
effect
that
money
is
the
of
all
evil
from
which
two
adages
it
may
be
safe
to
infer
that
the
aforesaid
species
of
tree
first
degenerated
into
a
shrub
then
absconded
underground
and
finally
in
our
iron
age
vanished
altogether
in
favorable
exposures
it
may
be
conjectured
that
a
specimen
or
two
survived
to
a
great
age
as
in
the
garden
of
the
hesperides
and
indeed
what
else
could
that
tree
in
the
sixth
æneid
have
been
with
a
branch
whereof
the
trojan
hero
procured
admission
to
a
territory
for
the
entering
of
which
money
is
a
surer
passport
than
to
a
certain
other
more
profitable
too
foreign
kingdom
whether
these
speculations
of
mine
have
any
force
in
them
or
whether
they
will
not
rather
by
most
readers
be
deemed
impertinent
to
the
matter
in
hand
is
a
question
which
i
leave
to
the
determination
of
an
indulgent
posterity
that
there
were
in
more
primitive
and
happier
times
shops
where
money
was
sold
and
that
too
on
credit
and
at
a
bargain
i
take
to
be
matter
of
demonstration
for
what
but
a
dealer
in
this
article
was
that
æolus
who
supplied
ulysses
with
motive
power
for
his
fleet
in
bags
what
that
ericus
king
of
sweden
who
is
said
to
have
kept
the
winds
in
his
cap
what
in
more
recent
times
those
lapland
nornas
who
traded
in
favorable
breezes
all
which
will
appear
the
more
clearly
when
we
consider
that
even
to
this
day
the
is
proverbial
for
raising
money
and
that
brokers
and
banks
were
invented
by
the
venetians
at
a
later
period
and
now
for
the
improvement
of
this
digression
i
find
a
parallel
to
sawin
fortune
in
an
adventure
of
my
own
for
shortly
after
i
had
first
broached
to
myself
the
and
archæological
theories
as
i
was
passing
negotia
penitus
mecum
through
one
of
the
obscure
suburbs
of
our
new
england
metropolis
my
eye
was
attracted
by
these
words
upon
a
here
was
at
once
the
confirmation
of
my
speculations
and
the
substance
of
my
hopes
here
lingered
the
fragment
of
a
happier
past
or
stretched
out
the
first
tremulous
organic
filament
of
a
more
fortunate
future
thus
glowed
the
distant
mexico
to
the
eyes
of
sawin
as
he
looked
through
the
dirty
pane
of
the
window
or
speculated
from
the
summit
of
that
which
the
imps
of
the
bottle
are
so
cunning
in
raising
up
already
had
my
even
during
that
first
glance
expended
in
various
useful
directions
the
funds
to
be
obtained
by
pledging
the
manuscript
of
a
proposed
volume
of
discourses
already
did
a
clock
ornament
the
tower
of
the
jaalam
a
gift
appropriately
but
modestly
commemorated
in
the
parish
and
town
records
both
for
now
many
years
kept
by
myself
already
had
my
son
seneca
completed
his
course
at
the
university
whether
for
the
moment
we
may
not
be
considered
as
actually
lording
it
over
those
baratarias
with
the
viceroyalty
of
which
hope
invests
us
and
whether
we
are
ever
so
warmly
housed
as
in
our
spanish
castles
would
afford
matter
of
argument
enough
that
i
found
that
to
be
no
other
than
a
bait
to
the
trap
of
a
decayed
grocer
nevertheless
i
bought
a
pound
of
dates
getting
short
weight
by
reason
of
immense
flights
of
harpy
flies
who
pursued
and
lighted
upon
their
prey
even
in
the
very
scales
which
purchase
i
made
not
only
with
an
eye
to
the
little
ones
at
home
but
also
as
a
figurative
reproof
of
that
too
frequent
habit
of
my
mind
which
forgetting
the
due
order
of
chronology
will
often
persuade
me
that
the
happy
sceptre
of
saturn
is
stretched
over
this
nineteenth
century
having
glanced
at
the
ledger
of
glory
under
the
title
let
us
extend
our
investigations
and
discover
if
that
instructive
volume
does
not
contain
some
charges
more
personally
interesting
to
ourselves
i
think
we
should
be
more
economical
of
our
resources
did
we
thoroughly
appreciate
the
fact
that
whenever
brother
jonathan
seems
to
be
thrusting
his
hand
into
his
own
pocket
he
is
in
fact
picking
ours
i
confess
that
the
late
which
the
country
has
been
running
has
materially
changed
my
views
as
to
the
best
method
of
raising
revenue
if
by
means
of
direct
taxation
the
bills
for
every
extraordinary
outlay
were
brought
under
our
immediate
eye
so
that
like
thrifty
housekeepers
we
could
see
where
and
how
fast
the
money
was
going
we
should
be
less
likely
to
commit
extravagances
at
present
these
things
are
managed
in
such
a
way
that
we
know
not
what
we
pay
for
the
poor
man
is
charged
as
much
as
the
rich
and
while
we
are
saving
and
scrimping
at
the
spigot
the
government
is
drawing
off
at
the
bung
if
we
could
know
that
a
part
of
the
money
we
expend
for
tea
and
coffee
goes
to
buy
powder
and
balls
and
that
it
is
mexican
blood
which
makes
the
clothes
on
our
backs
more
costly
it
would
set
some
of
us
athinking
during
the
present
fall

have
often
pictured
to
myself

government
official

my
study

fancy

my

with
yes

it
looks
like
a

but
in

verily
i
would
that
every

that

about
obtaining
money
under
the
false
pretence
of
being

for
me
i
have
an
imagination
which
plays
me
uncomfortable
tricks
it
happens
to
me
sometimes
to
see
a
slaughterer
on
his
way
home
from
his
day
work
and
forthwith
my
imagination
puts
a
upon
his
head
and
epaulettes
upon
his
shoulders
and
sets
him
up
as
a
candidate
for
the
presidency
so
also
on
a
recent
public
occasion
as
the
place
assigned
to
the
reverend
clergy
is
just
behind
that
of
officers
of
the
army
and
navy
in
processions
it
was
my
fortune
to
be
seated
at
the
over
against
one
of
these
respectable
persons
he
was
arrayed
as
out
of
his
own
profession
only
kings
and
footmen
are
in
europe
and
indians
in
america
now
what
does
my
imagination
but
set
to
work
upon
him
strip
him
of
his
gay
livery
and
present
him
to
me
coatless
his
trowsers
thrust
into
the
tops
of
a
pair
of
boots
thick
with
clotted
blood
and
a
basket
on
his
arm
out
of
which
lolled
a
axe
thereby
destroying
my
relish
for
the
temporal
mercies

the

a

upon

slender
comment
will
be
needful
in
what
river
selemnus
has
sawin
bathed
that
he
has
become
so
swiftly
oblivious
of
his
former
loves
from
an
ardent
and
as
befits
a
soldier
confident
wooer
of
that
coy
bride
the
popular
favor
we
see
him
subside
of
a
sudden
into
the
i
trust
not
jilted
cincinnatus
returning
to
his
plough
with
a
branch
of
willow
in
his
hand
figuratively
returning
however
to
a
figurative
plough
and
from
no
profound
affection
for
that
honored
implement
of
husbandry
for
which
indeed
sawin
never
displayed
any
decided
predilection
but
in
order
to
be
gracefully
summoned
therefrom
to
more
congenial
labors
it
would
seem
that
the
character
of
the
ancient
dictator
had
become
part
of
the
recognized
stock
of
our
modern
political
comedy
though
as
our
term
of
office
extends
to
a
quadrennial
length
the
parallel
is
not
so
minutely
exact
as
could
be
desired
it
is
sufficiently
so
however
for
purposes
of
scenic
representation
an
humble
cottage
if
built
of
logs
the
better
forms
the
arcadian
background
of
the
stage
this
rustic
paradise
is
labelled
ashland
jaalam
north
bend
marshfield
kinderhook
or
bâton
rouge
as
occasion
demands
before
the
door
stands
a
something
with
one
handle
the
other
painted
in
proper
perspective
which
represents
in
happy
ideal
vagueness
the
plough
to
this
the
defeated
candidate
rushes
with
delirous
joy
welcomed
as
a
father
by
appropriate
groups
of
happy
laborers
or
from
it
the
successful
one
is
torn
with
difficulty
sustained
alone
by
a
noble
sense
of
public
duty
only
i
have
observed
that
if
the
scene
be
laid
at
bâton
rouge
or
ashland
the
laborers
are
kept
carefully
in
the
background
and
are
heard
to
shout
from
behind
the
scenes
in
a
singular
tone
resembling
ululation
and
accompanied
by
a
sound
not
unlike
vigorous
clapping
this
however
may
be
artistically
in
keeping
with
the
habits
of
the
rustic
population
of
those
localities
the
precise
connection
between
agricultural
pursuits
and
statesmanship
i
have
not
been
able
after
diligent
inquiry
to
discover
but
that
my
investigations
may
not
be
barren
of
all
fruit
i
will
mention
one
curious
statistical
fact
which
i
consider
thoroughly
established
namely
that
no
real
farmer
ever
attains
practically
beyond
a
seat
in
general
court
however
theoretically
qualified
for
more
exalted
station
it
is
probable
that
some
other
prospect
has
been
opened
to
sawin
and
that
he
has
not
made
this
great
sacrifice
without
some
definite
understanding
in
regard
to
a
seat
in
the
cabinet
or
a
foreign
mission
it
may
be
supposed
that
we
of
jaalam
were
not
untouched
by
a
feeling
of
villatic
pride
in
beholding
our
townsman
occupying
so
large
a
space
in
the
public
eye
and
to
me
deeply
revolving
the
qualifications
necessary
to
a
candidate
in
these
frugal
times
those
of
seemed
peculiarly
adapted
to
a
successful
campaign
the
loss
of
a
leg
an
arm
an
eye
and
four
fingers
reduced
him
so
nearly
to
the
condition
of
a
et
præterea
that
i
could
think
of
nothing
but
the
loss
of
his
head
by
which
his
chance
could
have
been
bettered
but
since
he
has
chosen
to
baulk
our
suffrages
we
must
content
ourselves
with
what
we
can
get

another

this

some

than
this
noo
party
gut
to

ez

i
tell
ye
wut
but
even
ef

be
no
to

with
sech
critters
ez

down

a
feller
with

wuz
throwed
thet
would
say
his
prayers
this
brings
me
to
another

the
leaders
o

jest
sech
men
ez
i
can
act
along
with
free
an

we
walked
till
about
noon
an
then
it
grew
so
hot
i
thought
it
best
to
camp
awile
so
i
chose
out
a
spot
jest
under
a
magnoly
tree
an
there
right
down
i
sot
then
i
unstrapped
my

o
ciphered
up
how
much
the

but
wile
i
drinked
the
peaceful
cup
of
a
pure
heart
an
mind
mixed
with
some
wiskey
now
an
then
pomp
he
snaked
up
behind
an
creepin
close
tu
ez
quiet
ez
a
mink
jest
grabbed
my
leg
and
then
pulled
foot
quicker
you
could
wink
an
come
to
look
they
each
on
hed
gut
behin
a
tree
an
a
poked
out

leg
a
piece
jest
so
ez
i
could

an
yelled
to
me
to
throw
away
my
pistils
an
my

or

thet
they
cair
off

an
fairly

a
decent
alligatur
thet
hed
a
heart
so
destitoot
o
common
human
natur
however
ez
there
wor
no

i
finally
give
in
an
heft
my
arms
away
to
git
my
leg
safe
back
agin
pomp
gethered
all
the
weapins
up
an
then
he
come
an
grinned
he
showed
his
ivory
some
i
guess
an
sez
you
fairly
pinned
jest
buckle
on
your
leg
agin
an
git
right
up
an
come
du
fer
fammerly
men
like

to

swore
i
would
budge
jest
ez
you

quite
cool
either

so
this
monster
took
an
druv
me
back
along

very
feetmarks
o
my
happy
mornin
track
an
kep
me
an
worked

till

although
the
crittur
saw
how
much
it
hut

agin

he
could
read
a

he
gut
an
axed
ef
i
could
pint

but
there
i
put
his

some
out
o

roun
about

lookin
up
a

picked
out
a
middlin
shiny

givin

the

though
i
gut
ye

you
so
darned
lazy
i
do
think
you
hardly
wuth
your

besides
the
childrin
growin

i

thet
go

cus
o
shem
not
by

sooner
thet
i
go
thru

wen
i
hev

made
up
my
mind
a
aint
sotter
no
not
though
all
the
crows
thet
flies
to
pick
my
bones
wuz
cawin
i
guess
we
in
a
christian
land
yourn
here
patient
reader
we
take
leave
of
each
other
i
trust
with
some
mutual
satisfaction
i
say
for
i
love
not
that
kind
which
skims
dippingly
over
the
surface
of
the
page
as
swallows
over
a
pool
before
rain
by
such
no
pearls
shall
be
gathered
but
if
no
pearls
there
be
as
indeed
the
world
is
not
without
example
of
books
wherefrom
the
diver
shall
bring
up
no
more
than
his
proper
handful
of
mud
yet
let
us
hope
that
an
oyster
or
two
may
reward
adequate
perseverance
if
neither
pearls
nor
oysters
yet
is
patience
itself
a
gem
worth
diving
deeply
for
it
may
seem
to
some
that
too
much
space
has
been
usurped
by
my
own
private
lucubrations
and
some
may
be
fain
to
bring
against
me
that
old
jest
of
him
who
preached
all
his
hearers
out
of
the
meetinghouse
save
only
the
sexton
who
remaining
for
yet
a
little
space
from
a
sense
of
official
duty
at
last
gave
out
also
and
presenting
the
keys
humbly
requested
our
preacher
to
lock
the
doors
when
he
should
have
wholly
relieved
himself
of
his
testimony
i
confess
to
a
satisfaction
in
the
self
act
of
preaching
nor
do
i
esteem
a
discourse
to
be
wholly
thrown
away
even
upon
a
sleeping
or
unintelligent
auditory
i
can
not
easily
believe
that
the
gospel
of
saint
john
which
jacques
cartier
ordered
to
be
read
in
the
latin
tongue
to
the
canadian
savages
upon
his
first
meeting
with
them
fell
altogether
upon
stony
ground
for
the
earnestness
of
the
preacher
is
a
sermon
appreciable
by
dullest
intellects
and
most
alien
ears
in
this
wise
did
episcopius
convert
many
to
his
opinions
who
yet
understood
not
the
language
in
which
he
discoursed
the
chief
thing
is
that
the
messenger
believe
that
he
has
an
authentic
message
to
deliver
for
counterfeit
messengers
that
mode
of
treatment
which
father
john
de
plano
carpini
relates
to
have
prevailed
among
the
tartars
would
seem
effectual
and
perhaps
deserved
enough
for
my
own
part
i
may
lay
claim
to
so
much
of
the
spirit
of
martyrdom
as
would
have
led
me
to
go
into
banishment
with
those
clergymen
whom
alphonso
the
sixth
of
portugal
drave
out
of
his
kingdom
for
refusing
to
shorten
their
public
eloquence
it
is
possible
that
having
been
invited
into
my
brother
biglow
desk
i
may
have
been
too
little
scrupulous
in
using
it
for
the
venting
of
my
own
peculiar
doctrines
to
a
congregation
drawn
together
in
the
expectation
and
with
the
desire
of
hearing
him
i
am
not
wholly
unconscious
of
a
peculiarity
of
mental
organization
which
impels
me
like
the
with
its
train
of
cars
to
run
backward
for
a
short
distance
in
order
to
obtain
a
fairer
start
i
may
compare
myself
to
one
fishing
from
the
rocks
when
the
sea
runs
high
who
misinterpreting
the
suction
of
the
undertow
for
the
biting
of
some
larger
fish
jerks
suddenly
and
finds
that
he
has
hauling
in
upon
the
end
of
his
line
a
trail
of
various
among
which
nevertheless
the
naturalist
may
haply
find
something
to
repay
the
disappointment
of
the
angler
yet
have
i
conscientiously
endeavored
to
adapt
myself
to
the
impatient
temper
of
the
age
daily
degenerating
more
and
more
from
the
high
standard
of
our
pristine
new
england
to
the
catalogue
of
lost
arts
i
would
mournfully
add
also
that
of
listening
to
sermons
surely
we
have
been
abridged
into
a
race
of
pigmies
for
truly
in
those
of
the
old
discourses
yet
subsisting
to
us
in
print
the
endless
spinal
column
of
divisions
and
subdivisions
can
be
likened
to
nothing
so
exactly
as
to
the
vertebræ
of
the
saurians
whence
the
theorist
may
conjecture
a
race
of
anakim
proportionate
to
the
withstanding
of
these
other
monsters
i
say
anakim
rather
than
nephelim
because
there
seem
reasons
for
supposing
that
the
race
of
those
whose
heads
though
no
giants
are
constantly
enveloped
in
clouds
which
that
name
imports
will
never
become
extinct
the
attempt
to
vanquish
the
innumerable
of
one
of
those
aforementioned
discourses
may
supply
us
with
a
plausible
interpretation
of
the
second
labor
of
hercules
and
his
successful
experiment
with
fire
affords
us
a
useful
precedent
but
while
i
lament
the
degeneracy
of
the
age
in
this
regard
i
can
not
refuse
to
succumb
to
its
influence
looking
out
through
my

see
biglow
at
a
distance
busy
in
gathering
his
baldwins
of
which
to
judge
by
the
number
of
barrels
lying
about
under

his
crop
is
more
abundant
than
my
own
by
which
sight
i
am
admonished
to
turn
to
those
orchards
of
the
mind
wherein
my
labors
may
be

make
one
stare
all
corners
and
all
gables
like
dogs
let
loose
upon
a
bear
ten
emulous
styles
with
care
the
whole
among
them
seemed
to
tear
and
all
the
oddities
to
spare
were
set
upon
the
stables
knott
was
delighted
with
a
pile
approved
by
fashion
leaders
only
he
made
the
builder
smile
by
asking
every
little
while
why
that
was
called
the
twodoor
style
which
certainly
had
doors
yet
better
for
this
luckless
man
if
he
had
put
a
downright
ban
upon
the
thing
for
though
to
quit
affairs
his
plan
ere
many
days
poor
knott
began
perforce
accepting
draughts
that
ran
all
ways
except
up
chimney
the
house
though
painted
stone
to
mock
with
nice
white
lines
round
every
block
some
trepidation
stood
in
when
tempests
with
petrific
shock
so
to
speak
made
it
really
rock
though
not
a
whit
less
wooden
and
painted
stone
well
done
will
not
take
in
the
prodigal
sun
whose
beams
are
never
quite
at
one
with
our
terrestrial
lumber
so
the
wood
shrank
around
the
knots
and
gaped
in
disconcerting
spots
and
there
were
lots
of
dots
and
rots
and
crannies
without
number
wherethrough
as
you
may
well
presume
the
wind
like
water
through
a
flume
came
rushing
in
ecstatic
leaving
in
all
three
floors
no
room
that
was
not
a
rheumatic
and
what
with
points
and
squares
and
rounds
grown
shaky
on
their
poises
the
house
at
night
was
full
of
pounds
thumps
bumps
creaks
scratchings
raps
till
zounds
cried
knott
this
goes
beyond
all
bounds
i
do
not
deal
in
tongues
and
sounds
nor
have
i
let
my
house
and
grounds
to
a
family
of
noyeses
but
though
knott
house
was
full
of
airs
had
but
one
a
daughter
and
as
he
owned
much
stocks
and
shares
many
who
wished
to
render
theirs
such
vain
unsatisfying
cares
and
needed
wives
to
sew
their
tears
in
matrimony
sought
her
they
vowed
her
gold
they
wanted
not
their
faith
would
never
falter
they
longed
to
tie
this
single
knott
in
the
hymenæal
halter
so
daily
at
the
door
they
rang
cards
for
the
belle
delivering
or
in
the
choir
at
her
they
sang
achieving
such
a
rapturous
twang
as
set
her
nerves
now
knott
had
quite
made
up
his
mind
that
colonel
jones
should
have
her
no
beauty
he
but
oft
we
find
sweet
kernels
a
roughish
rind
so
hoped
his
jenny
be
resigned
and
make
no
more
palaver
glanced
at
the
fact
that
love
was
blind
that
girls
were
ratherish
inclined
to
pet
their
little
crosses
then
nosologically
defined
the
rate
at
which
the
system
pined
in
those
unfortunates
who
dined
upon
that
metaphoric
kind
of
dish
their
own
proboscis
but
she
with
many
tears
and
moans
besought
him
not
to
mock
her
said
was
too
much
for
flesh
and
bones
to
marry
mortgages
and
loans
that
fathers
hearts
were
stocks
and
stones
and
that
she
go
when
jones
to
davy
jones
locker
then
gave
her
head
a
little
toss
that
said
as
plain
as
ever
was
if
men
are
always
at
a
loss
mere
womankind
to
bridle
to
try
the
thing
on
woman
cross
were
fifty
times
as
idle
for
she
a
strict
resolve
had
made
and
registered
in
private
that
either
she
would
die
a
maid
or
else
be
mrs
doctor
slade
if
woman
could
contrive
it
and
though
the
was
set
jenny
was
more
so
rather
declaring
in
a
pretty
pet
that
they
spread
their
net
she
would
them
yet
the
colonel
and
her
father
just
at
this
time
the
public
eyes
were
keenly
on
the
watch
a
stir
beginning
slowly
to
arise
about
those
questions
and
replies
those
raps
that
unwrapped
mysteries
so
rapidly
at
rochester
and
knott
already
nervous
grown
by
lying
much
awake
alone
and
listening
sometimes
to
a
moan
and
sometimes
to
a
clatter
the
wind
at
night
would
rouse
the
on
his
house
or
when
some
mouse
behind
the
plastering
made
a
towse
about
a
family
matter
began
to
wonder
if
his
wife
a
paralytic
half
her
life
which
made
it
more
surprising
might
not
to
rule
him
from
her
urn
have
taken
a
peripatetic
turn
for
want
of
exorcising
this
thought
once
nestled
in
his
head
ere
long
contagious
grew
and
spread
infecting
all
his
mind
with
dread
until
at
last
he
lay
in
bed
and
heard
his
wife
with
tread
entering
the
kitchen
through
the
shed
or
his
fancy
mocking
opening
the
pantry
cutting
bread
and
then
she
been
some
ten
years
dead
closets
and
drawers
unlocking
or
in
his
room
his
breath
grew
thick
he
heard
the
click
of
slender
needles
flying
quick
as
if
she
knit
a
stocking
for
whom
he
prayed
that
years
might
flit
with
pains
rheumatic
shooting
before
those
ghostly
things
she
knit
upon
his
unfleshed
sole
might
fit
he
did
not
fancy
it
a
bit
to
stand
upon
that
footing
at
other
times
his
frightened
hairs
above
the
bedclothes
trusting
he
heard
her
full
of
household
cares
no
dream
entrapped
in
supper
snares
the
foal
of
horrible
nightmares
but
broad
awake
as
he
declares
go
bustling
up
and
down
the
stairs
or
setting
back
last
evening
chairs
or
with
the
poker
thrusting
the
hardened
crust
and
what
impossible
it
must
he
knew
she
had
returned
to
dust
and
yet
could
scarce
his
senses
trust
hearing
her
as
she
poked
and
fussed
about
the
parlor
dusting
night
after
night
he
strove
to
sleep
and
take
his
ease
in
spite
of
it
but
still
his
flesh
would
chill
and
creep
and
though
two
he
might
keep
he
could
not
so
make
light
of
it
at
last
quite
desperate
he
goes
and
tells
his
neighbors
all
his
woes
which
did
but
their
amount
enhance
they
made
such
mockery
of
his
fears
that
soon
his
days
were
of
all
jeers
his
nights
of
the
rueful
countenance
i
thought
most
folks
one
neighbor
said
gave
up
the
ghost
when
they
were
dead
another
gravely
shook
his
head
adding
from
all
we
hear
quite
plain
poor
knott
is
going
mad
for
how
can
he
at
once
be
sad
and
think
he
full
of
spirits
a
third
declared
he
knew
a
knife
would
cut
this
knott
much
quicker
the
surest
way
to
end
all
strife
and
lay
the
spirit
of
a
wife
is
just
to
take
and
lick
her
a
temperance
man
caught
up
the
word
ah
yes
he
groaned
i
always
heard
our
poor
friend
somewhat
slanted
taking
liquor
i
fear
these
spirits
may
be
dutch
a
sort
of
gins
or
something
such
with
which
his
house
is
haunted
i
see
the
thing
as
clear
as
light
if
knott
would
give
up
getting
tight
naught
farther
would
be
wanted
so
all
his
neighbors
stood
aloof
and
that
the
spirits
his
roof
were
not
entirely
up
to
proof
unanimously
granted
knott
knew
that
cocks
and
sprites
were
foes
and
so
bought
up
heaven
only
knows
how
many
though
he
wanted
crows
to
give
ghosts
caws
as
i
suppose
to
think
that
day
was
breaking
moreover
what
he
called
his
park
he
turned
into
a
kind
of
ark
for
dogs
because
a
little
bark
is
a
good
tonic
in
the
dark
if
one
is
given
to
waking
but
things
went
on
from
bad
to
worse
his
curs
were
nothing
but
a
curse
and
what
was
still
more
shocking
foul
ghosts
of
living
fowl
made
scoff
and
would
not
think
of
going
off
in
spite
of
all
his
cocking
shanghais
dominiques
malays
that
did
lay
for
weeks
polanders
bantams
dorkings
waiving
the
cost
no
trifling
ill
since
each
brought
in
his
little
bill
by
day
or
night
were
never
still
but
every
thought
of
rest
would
kill
with
cacklings
and
with
quorkings

ii
showing
what

at

the

were
somewhat
shy
coming
when
none
but
knott
was
nigh
and
people
said
was
all
their

or
rather
his

sly

machination
some
recommended
a

some
a

some
a
cold
to

some
a
decoction
of
some
a
southwesterly
grain
of
wheat
meat
was
by
some
pronounced
unmeet
others
thought
fish
most
indiscreet
and
that
was
worse
than
all
to
eat
of
vegetables
sour
or
sweet
except
perhaps
the
skin
of
beat
in
such
a
concatenation
one
quack

concurred
in
this
that
t
other
path
to

door
was
the
straight
one
still
spite
of
medical
advice
the
ghosts
came
thicker
and
a
spice
of
mischief
grew
apparent
nor
did
they
only
come
at
night
but
seemed
to
fancy
broad
daylight
till
knott
in
horror
and
affright
his
unoffending
hair
rent
with
handkerchief
on
lap
he
made
his
a
trap
to
catch
an
nap
the
spirits
always
on
the
tap
would
make
a
sudden
rap
the
cord
of
sleep
to
snap
and
what
is
life
without
its
nap
but
threadbareness
and
mere
mishap
as
were
with
a
percussion
cap
the
trouble
climax
capping
it
seemed
a
party
dried
and
grim
of
mummies
had
come
to
visit
him
each
getting
off
from
every
limb
its
multitudinous
wrapping
scratchings
sometimes
the
walls
ran
round
the
merest
of
sound
sometimes
was
only
by
the
pound
they
carried
on
their
dealing
a
thumping
the
parlor
floor
and
as
if
the
vegetables
in
store
quiet
and
orderly
before
were
all
together
pealing
you
would
have
thought
the
thing
was
done
by
the
spirit
of
some
son
of
a
gun
and
that
a
pounder
or
that
the
ghost
which
made
such
sounds
could
be
none
other
than
john
pounds
of
ragged
schools
the
founder
through
three
gradations
of
affright
the
awful
noises
reached
their
height
at
first
they
knocked
nocturnally
then
for
some
reason
changing
quite
as
mourners
after
six
months
flight
turn
suddenly
from
dark
to
light
began
to
knock
diurnally
and
last
combining
all
their
stocks
scotland
was
so
full
of
knox
into
one
chaos
father
of

they
showered
knocks
and
knocked
knocked
knocked
eternally
ever
upon
the
go
like
buoys
wooden
all
knott
joys
they
turned
to
troubles
and
a
noise
that
preyed
on
him
internally
soon
they
grew
wider
in
their
scope
whenever
knott
a
door
would
ope
it
would
ope

else
elope

fly

just
to

the

made

creatures

with
grovelling
intellects
and
base
they
could
not
find
the
slightest
trace
to
indicate
deception
indeed
it
is
declared
by
some
that
spirits
of
this
sort
are
glum
almost
or
wholly
deaf
and
dumb
and
out
of
quite
mum
to
sceptic
natures
cold
and
numb
who
of
kind
of
kingdom
come
have
not
a
just
conception
true
there
were
people
who
demurred
that
though
the
raps
no
doubt
were
heard
both
under
them
and
them
yet
somehow
when
a
search
they
made
they

always
there
before

this
had
its
due
effect
with
some
who
straight
departed
muttering
hum
transparent
hoax
and
gammon
but
these
were

believing
souls
came
day
by
day
in
larger
shoals
as
the
ancients
to
the
windy
holes
delphi
tripod
brought
their
doles
or
to
the
shrine
of

the
spirits
seemed
exceeding
tame
call
whom
you
fancied
and
he
came
the
shades
august
of
eldest
fame
you
summoned
with
an
awful
ease
as
grosser
spirits
gurgled
out
from
chair
and

with
a
spout
in

cellar
once
to
flout
the
senses
of
the
rabble
rout
the
gimlet
twirled
about

cunning
mephistophiles

did
these

seem
in

to
thrill

of

with

one

near
to
make
the
past

clear
sometimes
in
shocking
grammar
by
raps
and

now
there
now
here
it
seemed
as

departed
auctioneer
were
doomed
to
practise

with
the
spirit
of
his

you
asked

answered
yet
one
could
not
very
deeply
get
into
the
obliging
spirits
debt
because
they
used
the
alphabet
in
all
communications
and
new
revealings
though
sublime
rapped
out
one
letter
at
a
time
with
boggles
hesitations
stoppings
beginnings
again
and
getting
matters
into
train
could
hardly
overload
the

with

excessive
rations

just
to

ye
do

in

fearful
point

indeed
nothing

abused

downright
accused
the
poor
old
man
of

thus
by
dreadful

shown
some
spirit
longing
to
make
known
a
bloody
fact

the

declared
that
while
his
earthly
life
was
spared
about
the
country
he
had
fared
a
duly
licensed
follower
of
that
trade
that
wins

that
he

he

his

for
true

false
the
rumor
spread

as
for
this
roiled

it
would
not

so
he
said
to
have
it
go
no
furderer
at
last
scarce
knowing
what
it
meant
reluctantly
he
gave
consent
that
jenny
since
was
evident
that
she
follow
her
own
bent
should
make
her
own
election
for
that
appeared
the
only
way
these
frightful
noises
to
allay
which
had
already
turned
him
gray

plunged
him
in
dejection

the
selectmen
be
it
known
dug
underneath
the
aforesaid
stone
where
the
poor
peddler
corpse
was
thrown
and
found
thereunder
a
though
when
the
crowner
sat
thereon
he
nothing
hatched
except
alone
successive
broods
of
laughter
it
was
a
frail
and
dingy
thing
in
which
a
grinder
or
two
did
cling
in
color
like

which
surgeons
called
from

these

bones

buried
fifty
years
or
so
lose
their
identity

grow
from
human
bones

fond
of

that
a

be
most
scrupulously
weighed

searched
into
before
it

public

it
may
give

one
half
the
time
of
each
was
spent
in
praying
for

on
his
own

head
the
other
half
in
fearfully
portraying

certain
folks
would
go
when

were
dead

system
of

no

that

peace

so
they
two
played
at

kept

curse
forever

sacred
bean
he
loves
those
men
whose
nails
are
still
increased
who
all
their
lives
keep
ugly
foul
and
lean
is
of
his
grace
that
not
a
bird
or
beast
adorned
with
claws
like
mine
was
ever
seen
the
suns
and
stars
are
brahma
thoughts
divine
even
as
these
trees
i
seem
to
see
are
mine
viii
thou
to
see
indeed
roared
ahmed
back
were
i
but
once
across
this
plaguy
stream
with
a
stout
sapling
in
my
hand
one
whack
on
those
lank
ribs
would
rid
thee
of
that
dream
thy
is
ipecac
to
my
soul
stomach
thou
grasp
the
scheme
of
true
redemption
thou
know
that
deity
whirls
by
a
kind
of
blessed
spontaneity
ix
and
this
it
is
which
keeps
our
earth
here
going
with
all
the
stars
o
vile
but
there
a
place
prepared
for
such
to
think
of
brahma
throwing
worlds
like
a
juggler
balls
up
into
space
why
not
so
much
as
a
smooth
lotos
blowing
is
allowed
that
silence
to
efface
which
broods
around
brahma
and
our
earth
is
known
rests
on
a
tortoise
moveless
as
this
stone
x
so
they
kept
up
their
banning
amebean
when
suddenly
came
floating
down
the
stream
a
youth
whose
face
like
an
incarnate
pæan
glowed
was
so
full
of
grandeur
and
of
gleam
if
there
gods
then
doubtless
this
must
be
one
thought
both
at
once
and
then
began
to
scream
surely
immortals
know
thou
knowest
decide
between
us
twain
before
thou
goest
xi
the
youth
was
drifting
in
a
slim
canoe
most
like
a
huge
white
waterlily
petal
but
neither
of
our
theologians
knew
whereof
was
made
whether
of
heavenly
metal
unknown
or
of
a
vast
pearl
split
in
two
and
hollowed
was
a
point
they
could
not
settle
was
good
though
and
bore
large
fruit
in
after
years
of
many
a
tart
dispute
xii
there
were
no
wings
upon
the
stranger
shoulders
and
yet
he
seemed
so
capable
of
rising
that
had
he
soared
like
thistledown
beholders
had
thought
the
circumstance
noways
surprising
enough
that
he
remained
and
when
the
scolders
hailed
him
as
umpire
in
their
vocal
the
painter
of
his
boat
he
lightly
threw
around
a
and
brought
her
to
xiii
the
strange
youth
had
a
look
as
if
he
might
have
trod
far
planets
where
the
atmosphere
of
nobler
temper
steeps
the
face
with
light
just
as
our
skins
are
tanned
and
freckled
here
his
air
was
that
of
a
cosmopolite
in
the
wide
universe
from
sphere
to
sphere
perhaps
he
was
his
face
had
such
grave
beauty
an
officer
of
saturn
guards
off
duty
xiv
both
saints
began
to
unfold
their
tales
at
once
both
wished
their
tales
like
simial
ones
prehensile
that
they
might
seize
his
ear
and
flew
zigzag
back
and
forth
like
strokes
of
pencil
in
a
child
fingers
voluble
as
duns
they
jabbered
like
the
stones
on
that
immense
hill
in
the
arabian
nights
until
the
stranger
began
to
think
his
in
some
danger
xv
in
general
those
who
nothing
have
to
say
contrive
to
spend
the
longest
time
in
doing
it
they
turn
and
vary
it
in
every
way
hashing
it
stewing
it
mincing
it
it
sometimes
they
keep
it
purposely
at
bay
then
let
it
slip
to
be
again
pursuing
it
they
drone
it
groan
it
whisper
it
and
shout
it
refute
it
flout
it
swear
prove
it
doubt
it
xvi
our
saints
had
practised
for
some
thirty
years
their
talk
beginning
with
a
single
stem
spread
like
a
banyan
sending
down
live
piers
colonies
of
digression
and
in
them
germs
of
yet
new
migrations
once
by
the
ears
they
could
convey
damnation
in
a
hem
and
blow
the
pitch
of
off
long
syllogistic
batteries
with
a
cough
xvii
each
had
a
theory
that
the
human
ear
a
providential
tunnel
was
which
led
to
a
huge
vacuum
and
surely
here
they
showed
some
knowledge
of
the
general
head
for
cant
to
be
decanted
through
a
mere
auricular
canal
or
raceway
to
be
fed
all
day
and
night
in
sunshine
and
in
shower
from
their
vast
heads
of
xviii
the
present
being
a
peculiar
case
each
with
unwonted
zeal
the
other
scouted
put
his
spurred
hobby
through
its
very
pace
pished
pshawed
poohed
horribled
bahed
jeered
sneered
flouted
sniffed
nonsensed
infideled
fudged
with
his
face
looked
scorn
too
nicely
shaded
to
be
shouted
and
with
each
inch
of
person
and
of
vesture
contrived
to
hint
some
most
disdainful
gesture
xix
at
length
when
their
breath
end
was
come
about
and
both
could
now
and
then
just
gasp
impostor
holding
their
heads
thrust
menacingly
out
as
staggering
cocks
keep
up
their
fighting
posture
the
stranger
smiled
and
said
beyond
a
doubt
is
fortunate
my
friends
that
you
have
lost
your
united
parts
of
speech
or
it
had
been
impossible
for
me
to
get

are
you
not
limbed
nerved
jointed

juiced
as
other

yet
faithless

rather
like

you

you

no

had
you
been
forced
to
earn
what

shown
a

plan
at

your
whole
function
is
to
eat
ten

talk
ten
times
as
rapidly
as
you
can
were
your
shape
true
to
cosmogonic
laws
you
would
be
nothing
but
a
pair
of
jaws
xxii
of
all

useless

the

spare
most
easily
you
bakers
of
little
clay
gods
formed
in
shape
and
fashion
precisely
in
the
image
of
their
makers
why
it
would
almost
move
a
saint
to
passion
to
see
these
blind
and
deaf
the
hourly
breakers
of
god
own
image
in
their
brother
men
set
themselves
up
to
tell
the
how

xxiii
of

vile
mud
pat
up
a
god
and
burn

hang
or
curse
whoever
worships
not
each
keeps
his
stud
of
texts
which
wait
with
saddle
on
and
bridle
to
hunt
down
atheists
to
their
ugly
idol
xxiv
this
i
perceive
has
been
your
occupation
you
should
have
been
more
usefully
employed
all
men
are
bound
to
earn
their
daily
ration
where
states
make
not
that
primal
contract
void
by
cramps
and
limits
simple
devastation
is
the
worm
task
and
what
he
has
destroyed
his
monument
creating
is
man
work
and
that
too
something
more
than
mist
and
murk
xxv
so
having
said
the
youth
was
seen
no
more
and
straightway
our
sage
brahmin
the
philosopher
cried
that
was
aimed
at
thee
thou
endless
bore
idle
and
useless
as
the
growth
of
moss
over
a
rotting
i
would
square
that
score
full
soon
replied
the
dervise
could
i
cross
over
and
catch
thee
by
the
beard
thy
nails
i
trim
and
make
thee
work
as
was
advised
by
him
xxvi
work
am
i
not
at
work
from
morn
till
night
sounding
the
deeps
of
oracles
umbilical
which
for
man
guidance
never
come
to
light
with
all
their
various
aptitudes
until
i
call
and
i
do
i
not
twirl
from
left
to
right
for
conscience
sake
is
that
no
work
thou
silly
gull
he
had
thee
in
his
eye
was
gabriel
sent
to
reward
my
faith
i
know
him
well
xxvii
was
vishnu
thou
vile
whirligig
and
so
the
good
old
quarrel
was
begun
anew
one
would
have
sworn
the
sky
was
black
as
sloe
had
but
the
other
darned
to
call
it
blue
nor
were
the
followers
who
fed
them
slow
to
treat
each
other
with
their
curses
too
each
hating
moves
it
tears
or
laughter
because
he
thought
him
sure
of
hell
hereafter
xxviii
at
last
some
genius
built
a
bridge
of
boats
over
the
stream
and
ahmed
zealots
filed
across
upon
a
mission
to
cut
throats
and
spread
religion
pure
and
undefiled
they
sowed
the
propagandist
wildest
oats
cutting
off
all
down
to
the
smallest
child
and
came
back
giving
thanks
for
such
fat
mercies
to
find
their
harvest
gone
past
prayers
or
curses
xxix
all
gone
except
their
saint
religious
hops
which
he
kept
up
with
more
than
common
flourish
but
these
however
satisfying
crops
for
the
inner
man
were
not
enough
to
nourish
the
body
politic
which
quickly
drops
reserve
in
such
sad
juncture
and
turns
currish
so
ahmed
soon
got
cursed
for
all
the
famine
the
popular
voice
could
edge
a
damn
in
xxx
at
first
he
pledged
a
miracle
quite
boldly
and
for
a
day
or
two
they
growled
and
waited
but
finding
that
this
kind
of
manna
coldly
sat
on
their
stomachs
they
ere
long
berated
the
saint
for
still
persisting
in
that
old
lie
till
soon
the
whole
machine
of
saintship
grated
ran
slow
creaked
stopped
and
wishing
him
in
tophet
they
gathered
strength
enough
to
stone
the
prophet
xxxi
some
stronger
ones
contrived
by
eating
leather
their
weaker
friends
and
one
thing
or
another
the
winter
months
of
scarcity
to
weather
among
these
was
the
late
saint
younger
brother
who
in
the
spring
collecting
them
together
persuaded
them
that
ahmed
holy
pother
had
wrought
in
their
behalf
and
that
the
place
of
saint
should
be
continued
to
his
race
xxxii
accordingly
was
settled
on
the
spot
that
allah
favored
that
peculiar
breed
beside
as
all
were
satisfied
not
be
quite
respectable
to
have
the
need
of
public
spiritual
food
forgot
and
so
the
tribe
with
proper
forms
decreed
that
he
and
failing
him
his
next
of
kin
forever
for
the
people
good
