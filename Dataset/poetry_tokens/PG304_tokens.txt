rio

last
race
now
this
was
what
macpherson
told
while
waiting
in
the
stand
a
reckless
rider
the
only
man
with
hands
to
hold
the
rushing
rio
grande
he
said
day
i
bid
to
bit
and
bridle
rein
to
ditches
deep
and
fences
high
for
i
have
dreamed
a
dream
and
i
shall
never
ride
again
dreamt
last
night
i
rode
this
race
that
i
must
ride
and
down
to
take
my
place
i
saw
full
many
an
old
friend
face
come
stealing
to
my
side
men
on
horses
long
since
dead
they
clustered
on
the
track
the
champions
of
the
days
long
fled
they
moved
around
with
noiseless
tread
bay
chestnut
brown
and
black
one
man
on
a
big
grey
steed
rode
up
and
waved
his
hand
said
he
we
help
a
friend
in
need
and
we
have
come
to
give
a
lead
to
you
and
rio
grande
for
you
must
give
the
field
the
slip
so
never
draw
the
rein
but
keep
him
moving
with
the
whip
and
if
he
falter
set
your
lip
and
rouse
him
up
again
but
when
you
reach
the
big
stone
wall
put
down
your
bridle
hand
and
let
him
sail
he
can
not
fall
but
do
you
interfere
at
all
you
trust
old
rio
grande
started
and
in
front
we
showed
the
big
horse
running
free
right
fearlessly
and
game
he
strode
and
by
my
side
those
dead
men
rode
whom
no
one
else
could
see
silently
as
flies
a
bird
they
rode
on
either
hand
at
every
fence
i
plainly
heard
the
phantom
leader
give
the
word
make
room
for
rio
grande
spurred
him
on
to
get
the
lead
i
chanced
full
many
a
fall
but
swifter
still
each
phantom
steed
kept
with
me
and
at
racing
speed
we
reached
the
big
stone
wall
there
the
phantoms
on
each
side
drew
in
and
blocked
his
leap
make
room
make
room
i
loudly
cried
but
right
in
front
they
seemed
to
ride
i
cursed
them
in
my
sleep
never
flinched
he
faced
it
game
he
struck
it
with
his
chest
and
every
stone
burst
out
in
flame
and
rio
grande
and
i
became
as
phantoms
with
the
rest
then
i
woke
and
for
a
space
all
nerveless
did
i
seem
for
i
have
ridden
many
a
race
but
never
one
at
such
a
pace
as
in
that
fearful
dream
i
am
sure
as
man
can
be
that
out
upon
the
track
those
phantoms
that
men
can
not
see
are
waiting
now
to
ride
with
me
and
i
shall
not
come
back
i
must
ride
the
dead
men
race
and
follow
their
command
worse
than
death
the
foul
disgrace
if
i
should
fear
to
take
my
place
on
rio
grande
he
mounted
and
a
jest
he
threw
with
never
sign
of
gloom
but
all
who
heard
the
story
knew
that
jack
macpherson
brave
and
true
was
going
to
his
doom
they
started
and
the
big
black
steed
came
flashing
past
the
stand
all
in
the
lead
he
strode
along
at
racing
speed
the
mighty
rio
grande
but
on
his
ribs
the
whalebone
stung
a
madness
it
did
seem
and
soon
it
rose
on
every
tongue
that
jack
macpherson
rode
among
the
creatures
of
his
dream
he
looked
to
left
and
looked
to
right
as
though
men
rode
beside
and
rio
grande
with
white
raced
at
his
jumps
in
headlong
flight
and
cleared
them
in
his
stride
but
when
they
reached
the
big
stone
wall
down
went
the
and
loud
we
heard
macpherson
call
room
or
half
the
field
will
fall
make
room
for
rio
grande
down
he
down
and
horse
and
man
lay
quiet
side
by
side
no
need
the
pallid
face
to
scan
we
knew
with
rio
grande
he
ran
the
race
the
dead
men
ride
by
the
grey
far
to
the
northward
there
lies
a
land
a
wonderful
land
that
the
winds
blow
over
and
none
may
fathom
nor
understand
the
charm
it
holds
for
the
restless
rover
a
great
grey
chaos
a
land
half
made
where
endless
space
is
and
no
life
stirreth
and
the
soul
of
a
man
will
recoil
afraid
from
the
visage
that
nature
weareth
but
old
dame
nature
though
scornful
craves
her
dole
of
death
and
her
share
of
slaughter
many
indeed
are
the
nameless
graves
where
her
victims
sleep
by
the
grey
slowly
and
slowly
those
grey
streams
glide
drifting
along
with
a
languid
motion
lapping
the
on
either
side
wending
their
way
to
the
northern
ocean
grey
are
the
plains
where
the
emus
pass
silent
and
slow
with
their
staid
demeanour
over
the
dead
men
graves
the
grass
maybe
is
waving
a
trifle
greener
down
in
the
world
where
men
toil
and
spin
dame
nature
smiles
as
man
hand
has
taught
her
only
the
dead
men
her
smiles
can
win
in
the
great
lone
land
by
the
grey
for
the
strength
of
man
is
an
insect
strength
in
the
face
of
that
mighty
plain
and
river
and
the
life
of
a
man
is
a
moment
length
to
the
life
of
the
stream
that
will
run
for
ever
and
so
it
cometh
they
take
no
part
in
worries
each
hardy
rover
rideth
abroad
and
is
light
of
heart
with
the
plains
around
and
the
blue
sky
over
and
up
in
the
heavens
the
brown
lark
sings
the
songs
that
the
strange
wild
land
has
taught
her
full
of
thanksgiving
her
sweet
song
rings
and
i
wish
i
were
back
by
the
grey
with
the
cattle
the
drought
is
down
on
field
and
flock
the
is
dry
and
we
must
shift
the
starving
stock
before
the
cattle
die
we
muster
up
with
weary
hearts
at
breaking
of
the
day
and
turn
our
heads
to
foreign
parts
to
take
the
stock
away
and
it
hunt
up
and
dog
and
it
get
the
whip
and
flog
for
it
weary
work
is
droving
when
they
dying
every
day
by
bare
and
eaten
on
dusty
roads
and
beaten
with
half
a
chance
to
save
their
lives
we
take
the
stock
away
we
can
not
use
the
whip
for
shame
on
beasts
that
crawl
along
we
have
to
drop
the
weak
and
lame
and
try
to
save
the
strong
the
wrath
of
god
is
on
the
track
the
drought
fiend
holds
his
sway
with
blows
and
cries
and
stockwhip
crack
we
take
the
stock
away
as
they
fall
we
leave
them
lying
with
the
crows
to
watch
them
dying
grim
sextons
of
the
overland
that
fasten
on
their
prey
by
the
fiery
drifting
and
the
mocking
mirage
shifting
in
heat
and
drought
and
hopeless
pain
we
take
the
stock
away
in
dull
despair
the
days
go
by
with
never
hope
of
change
but
every
stage
we
draw
more
nigh
towards
the
mountain
range
and
some
may
live
to
climb
the
pass
and
reach
the
great
plateau
and
revel
in
the
mountain
grass
by
streamlets
fed
with
snow
as
the
mountain
wind
is
blowing
it
starts
the
cattle
lowing
and
calling
to
each
other
down
the
dusty
long
array
and
there
speaks
a
grizzled
drover
thank
god
the
worst
is
over
the
creatures
smell
the
mountain
grass
that
twenty
miles
away
they
press
towards
the
mountain
grass
they
look
with
eager
eyes
along
the
rugged
stony
pass
that
slopes
towards
the
skies
their
feet
may
bleed
from
rocks
and
stones
but
though
the
starts
they
struggle
on
with
stifled
groans
for
hope
is
in
their
hearts
and
the
cattle
that
are
leading
though
their
feet
are
worn
and
bleeding
are
breaking
to
a
kind
of
run
pull
up
and
let
them
go
for
the
mountain
wind
is
blowing
and
the
mountain
grass
is
growing
they
settle
down
by
running
streams
with
melted
the
days
are
done
of
heat
and
drought
upon
the
stricken
plain
the
wind
has
shifted
right
about
and
brought
the
welcome
rain
the
river
runs
with
sullen
roar
all
flecked
with
yellow
foam
and
we
must
take
the
road
once
more
to
bring
the
cattle
home
and
it
we
raise
a
chorus
there
a
pleasant
trip
before
us
and
the
horses
bound
beneath
us
as
we
start
them
down
the
track
and
the
drovers
canter
singing
through
the
sweet
green
grasses
springing
towards
the
to
bring
the
cattle
back
are
these
the
beasts
we
brought
away
that
move
so
lively
now
they
scatter
off
like
flying
spray
across
the
mountain
brow
and
dashing
down
the
rugged
range
we
hear
the
stockwhip
crack
good
faith
it
is
a
welcome
change
to
bring
such
cattle
back
and
it
down
the
lead
there
and
it
stop
and
feed
there
for
they
wild
as
mountain
eagles
and
their
sides
are
all
afoam
but
they
settling
down
already
and
they
travel
nice
and
steady
with
cheery
call
and
jest
and
song
we
fetch
the
cattle
home
we
have
to
watch
them
close
at
night
for
fear
they
make
a
rush
and
break
away
in
headlong
flight
across
the
open
bush
and
by
the
cheery
blaze
with
mellow
voice
and
strong
we
hear
the
lonely
watchman
raise
the
overlander
song
it
when
we
done
with
roving
with
the
camping
and
the
droving
it
homeward
down
the
bland
we
go
and
never
more
we
roam
while
the
stars
shine
out
above
us
like
the
eyes
of
those
who
love
us
the
eyes
of
those
who
watch
and
wait
to
greet
the
cattle
home
the
plains
are
all
awave
with
grass
the
skies
are
deepest
blue
and
leisurely
the
cattle
pass
and
feed
the
long
day
through
but
when
we
sight
the
station
gate
we
make
the
stockwhips
crack
a
welcome
sound
to
those
who
wait
to
greet
the
cattle
back
and
through
the
twilight
falling
we
hear
their
voices
calling
as
the
cattle
splash
across
the
ford
and
churn
it
into
foam
and
the
children
run
to
meet
us
and
our
wives
and
sweethearts
greet
us
their
heroes
from
the
overland
who
brought
the
cattle
home
the
first
surveyor
opening
of
the
railway
line
the
governor
and
all
with
flags
and
banners
down
the
street
a
banquet
and
a
ball
hark
to
at
the
station
now
they
raising
cheer
on
cheer
the
man
who
brought
the
railway
through
our
friend
the
engineer
cheer
his
pluck
and
enterprise
and
engineering
skill
was
my
old
husband
found
the
pass
behind
that
big
red
hill
before
the
engineer
was
grown
we
settled
with
our
stock
behind
that
great
big
mountain
chain
a
line
of
range
and
rock
a
line
that
kept
us
starving
there
in
weary
weeks
of
drought
with
a
track
across
the
range
to
let
the
cattle
out
twas
then
with
horses
starved
and
weak
and
scarcely
fit
to
crawl
my
husband
went
to
find
a
way
across
that
rocky
wall
he
vanished
in
the
wilderness
god
knows
where
he
was
gone
he
hunted
till
his
food
gave
out
but
still
he
battled
on
his
horses
strayed
was
well
they
did
they
made
towards
the
grass
and
down
behind
that
big
red
hill
they
found
an
easy
pass
followed
up
and
blazed
the
trees
to
show
the
safest
track
then
drew
his
belt
another
hole
and
turned
and
started
back
his
horses
died
just
one
pulled
through
with
nothing
much
to
spare
god
bless
the
beast
that
brought
him
home
the
old
white
arab
mare
we
drove
the
cattle
through
the
hills
along
the
way
and
this
was
our
first
just
where
i
live
others
came
across
the
range
and
built
the
township
here
and
then
there
came
the
railway
line
and
this
young
engineer
he
drove
about
with
tents
and
traps
a
cook
to
cook
his
meals
a
bath
to
wash
himself
at
night
a
at
his
heels
and
that
was
all
the
pluck
and
skill
for
which
he
cheered
and
praised
for
after
all
he
took
the
track
the
same
my
husband
blazed
poor
old
husband
dead
and
gone
with
never
feast
nor
cheer
he
buried
by
the
railway
line
i
wonder
can
he
hear
when
down
the
very
track
he
marked
and
close
to
where
he
laid
the
cattle
trains
go
roaring
down
the
grade
i
wonder
does
he
hear
them
pass
and
can
he
see
the
sight
when
through
the
dark
the
fast
express
goes
flaming
by
at
night
think
comfort
him
to
know
there
someone
left
to
care
i
take
some
things
this
very
night
and
hold
a
banquet
there
the
hard
old
fare
we
often
shared
together
him
and
me
some
damper
and
a
bite
of

mulga

bicycle
was
mulga
bill
from
eaglehawk
that
caught
the
cycling
craze
he
turned
away
the
good
old
horse
that
served
him
many
days
he
dressed
himself
in
cycling
clothes
resplendent
to
be
seen
he
hurried
off
to
town
and
bought
a
shining
new
machine
and
as
he
wheeled
it
through
the
door
with
air
of
lordly
pride
the
grinning
shop
assistant
said
me
can
you
ride
here
young
man
said
mulga
bill
walgett
to
the
sea
from
conroy
gap
to
castlereagh
there
none
can
ride
like
me
i
good
all
round
at
everything
as
everybody
knows
although
i
not
the
one
to
talk
i
hate
a
man
that
blows
but
riding
is
my
special
gift
my
chiefest
sole
delight
just
ask
a
wild
duck
can
it
swim
a
wild
cat
can
it
fight
there
nothing
clothed
in
hair
or
hide
or
built
of
flesh
or
steel
there
nothing
walks
or
jumps
or
runs
on
axle
hoof
or
wheel
but
what
i
sit
while
hide
will
hold
and
girths
and
straps
are
tight
i
ride
this
here
concern
right
straight
away
at
sight
was
mulga
bill
from
eaglehawk
that
sought
his
own
abode
that
perched
above
the
dead
man
creek
beside
the
mountain
road
he
turned
the
cycle
down
the
hill
and
mounted
for
the
fray
but
ere
he
gone
a
dozen
yards
it
bolted
clean
away
it
left
the
track
and
through
the
trees
just
like
a
silver
streak
it
whistled
down
the
awful
slope
towards
the
dead
man
creek
it
shaved
a
stump
by
half
an
inch
it
dodged
a
big
the
very
wallaroos
in
fright
went
scrambling
up
the
rocks
the
wombats
hiding
in
their
caves
dug
deeper
underground
as
mulga
bill
as
white
as
chalk
sat
tight
to
every
bound
it
struck
a
stone
and
gave
a
spring
that
cleared
a
fallen
tree
it
raced
beside
a
precipice
as
close
as
close
could
be
and
then
as
mulga
bill
let
out
one
last
despairing
shriek
it
made
a
leap
of
twenty
feet
into
the
dead
man
creek
was
mulga
bill
from
eaglehawk
that
slowly
swam
ashore
he
said
had
some
narrer
shaves
and
lively
rides
before
i
rode
a
wild
bull
round
a
yard
to
win
a
five
pound
bet
but
this
was
the
most
awful
ride
that
i
encountered
yet
i
give
that
outlaw
best
it
shaken
all
my
nerve
to
feel
it
whistle
through
the
air
and
plunge
and
buck
and
swerve
it
safe
at
rest
in
dead
man
creek
we
leave
it
lying
still
a

good
enough

wherever
it
pleased
him
taking

from

and
thither
he
wandered
steering
by

and
by

fearless
he
was
beyond

looking
at

this
was
his
formula
always

dived
in
the
depths
of

down
twenty
fathom
and
five
down
where
by
law
and
by
reason
men
are
forbidden
to

down

so
awful
that
only

was
returning
infinite
tortures
of

sailed
once

to

and
descended
again
scarce
grew
the
shell
in
the
shallows
rarely
a
patch
could
they
touch
always
the
take
was
so
little
always
the
labour
so
much
always
they
thought
of
the
islands
held
by
the
lumbering
dutch
islands
where
shell
was
in
plenty
lying
in
passage
and
bay
islands
where
divers
could
gather
hundreds
of
shell
in
a
day
but
the
lumbering
dutch
with
their
gunboats
hunted
the
divers
away
joe
nagasaki
the
finding
the
profits
grow
small
said
us

go

the

knowing
full
well
what
it
meant
fatalist
gambler
and
stoic
smiled
a
broad
smile
of
content
flattened
in
mainsail
and
foresail
and
off
to
the
islands
they
went
close
to
the
headlands
they
drifted
picking
up
shell
by
the
ton
piled
up
on
deck
were
the
oysters
opening
wide
in
the
sun
when
from
the
lee
of
the
headland
boomed
the
report
of
a
gun
once
that
the
diver
was
sighted
and
lugger
must
go
joe
nagasaki
decided
quick
was
the
word
and
the
blow
cut
both
the
pipe
and
the
leaving
the

below
kanzo
makame
the

failing
to
quite
understand
pulled

it
was

in

then
like
a
little
brown
stoic
lay
down
and
died
on
the
sand
joe

the
smiling
a
sanctified
smile
headed
her
straight
for
the
gunboat

out

all
the

they
watched
him
as

he
ran
doubting

what

the
city
of
dreadful
thirst
the
stranger
came
from
narromine
and
made
his
little
joke
say
we
folks
in
narromine
are
folk
but
all
the
smartest
men
down
here
are
puzzled
to
define
a
kind
of
new
phenomenon
that
came
to
narromine
summer
up
in
narromine
was
gettin
rather
warm
two
hundred
in
the
and
lookin
like
a
storm
we
all
were
in
the
private
bar
the
coolest
place
in
town
when
out
across
the
stretch
of
plain
a
cloud
came
rollin
down
do
respect
the
clouds
up
there
they
fill
us
with
disgust
they
mostly
bring
a
bogan
shower
three
and
some
dust
but
each
man
to
each
man
said
i
think
that
cloud
suggests
it
up
to
us
to
have
another
drink
clouds
of
rain
and
clouds
of
dust
we
heard
of
them
before
and
sometimes
in
the
daily
press
we
read
of
clouds
of
war
but
if
this
ai
the
gospel
truth
i
hope
that
i
may
burst
that
cloud
that
came
to
narromine
was
just
a
cloud
of
thirst
was
like
a
common
cloud
was
more
a
sort
of
haze
it
settled
down
about
the
streets
and
stopped
for
days
and
days
and
not
a
drop
of
dew
could
fall
and
not
a
sunbeam
shine
to
pierce
that
dismal
sort
of
mist
that
hung
on
narromine
lord
we
had
a
dreadful
time
beneath
that
cloud
of
thirst
we
all
our
daily
work
and
went
upon
the
burst
the
very
blacks
about
the
town
that
used
to
cadge
for
grub
they
made
an
organised
attack
and
tried
to
loot
the
pub
could
leave
the
private
bar
no
matter
how
we
tried
shearers
and
squatters
and
blacklegs
side
by
side
were
drinkin
there
and
durs
move
for
each
was
sure
he
said
before
he
get
a
the
thirst
would
strike
him
dead
drank
until
the
drink
gave
out
we
searched
from
room
to
room
and
round
the
pub
like
drunken
ghosts
went
howling
through
the
gloom
the
shearers
found
some
kerosene
and
settled
down
again
but
all
the
squatter
chaps
and
i
we
staggered
to
the
train
once
outside
the
cloud
of
thirst
we
felt
as
right
as
pie
but
while
we
stopped
about
the
town
we
had
to
drink
or
die
but
now
i
hear
it
safe
enough
i
going
back
to
work
because
they
say
the
cloud
of
thirst
has
shifted
on
to
bourke
when
you
see
those
clouds
about
like
this
one
over
here
all
white
and
frothy
at
the
top
just
like
a
pint
of
beer
it
time
to
go
and
have
a
drink
for
if
that
cloud
should
burst
you
find
the
drink
would
all
be
gone
for
that
a
cloud
of
thirst
we
stood
the
man
from
narromine
a
pint
of
he
drank
it
off
without
a
gasp
in
one
tremendous
quaff
joined
some
friends
last
night
he
said
what
they
called
a
spree
but
after
narromine
was
just
a
holiday
to
me
and
now
beyond
the
western
range
where
sunset
skies
are
red
and
clouds
of
dust
and
clouds
of
thirst
go
drifting
overhead
the
is
taking
back
along
the
western
line
that
person
on
his
road
to
narromine
saltbush
bill
gamecock
was
saltbush
bill
with
his
travelling
sheep
was
making
his
way
to
town
he
crossed
them
over
the
hard
times
run
and
he
came
to
the
take
down
he
counted
through
at
the
boundary
gate
and
camped
at
the
drafting
yard
for
stingy
smith
of
the
hard
times
run
had
hunted
him
rather
hard
he
bore
no
malice
to
stingy
smith
was
simply
the
hand
of
fate
that
caused
his
waggon
to
swerve
aside
and
shatter
old
stingy
gate
and
being
only
the
hand
of
fate
it
follows
without
a
doubt
it
was
the
fault
of
saltbush
bill
that
stingy
sheep
got
out
so
saltbush
bill
with
an
easy
heart
prepared
for
what
might
befall
commenced
his
stages
on
take
down
the
station
of
rooster
hall
is
strange
how
often
the
men
out
back
will
take
to
some
curious
craft
some
ruling
passion
to
keep
their
thoughts
away
from
the
overdraft
and
rooster
hall
of
the
take
down
was
widely
known
to
fame
as
breeder
of
champion
fighting
cocks
his
was
the
british
game
the
passing
stranger
within
his
gates
that
camped
with
old
rooster
hall
was
forced
to
talk
about
fowls
all
night
or
else
not
talk
at
all
though
droughts
should
come
and
though
sheep
should
die
his
fowls
were
his
sole
delight
he
left
his
shed
in
the
flood
of
work
to
watch
two
gamecocks
fight
he
held
in
scorn
the
australian
game
that
child
of
sin
in
a
desperate
fight
with
the
spurs
the
british
game
must
win
the
australian
bird
was
a
mongrel
bird
with
a
touch
of
the
jungle
cock
the
want
of
breeding
must
find
him
out
when
facing
the
english
stock
for
british
breeding
and
british
pluck
must
triumph
it
over
all
and
that
was
the
root
of
the
simple
creed
that
governed
old
rooster
was
saltbush
bill
to
the
station
rode
ahead
of
his
travelling
sheep
and
sent
a
message
to
rooster
hall
that
wakened
him
out
of
his
sleep
a
crafty
message
that
fetched
him
out
and
hurried
him
as
he
came
drover
has
an
australian
bird
to
match
with
your
british
game
was
done
and
done
in
a
half
a
trice
a
note
aside
old
rooster
hall
with
his
champion
bird
and
the
drover
bird
untried
spurs
of
course
said
old
rooster
hall
need
without
a
doubt
stick
the
spurs
on
your
bird
said
bill
mine
fights
best
without
best
without
said
old
rooster
hall
ca
fight
best
unspurred
you
must
be
crazy
but
saltbush
bill
said
till
you
see
my
bird
so
rooster
hall
to
his
fowlyard
went
and
quickly
back
he
came
bearing
a
clipt
and
a
shaven
cock
the
pride
of
his
english
game
with
an
eye
as
fierce
as
an
eaglehawk
and
a
crow
like
a
trumpet
call
he
strutted
about
on
the
garden
walk
and
cackled
at
rooster
hall
then
rooster
hall
sent
off
a
boy
with
word
to
his
cronies
two
mccrae
the
boss
of
the
black
police
and
father
donahoo
full
many
a
cockfight
old
mccrae
had
held
in
his
empty
court
with
father
as
a
a
regular
sport
they
got
the
message
of
rooster
hall
and
down
to
his
run
they
came
prepared
to
scoff
at
the
drover
bird
and
to
bet
on
the
english
game
they
hied
them
off
to
the
drover
camp
while
saltbush
rode
before
old
rooster
hall
was
a
blithesome
man
when
he
thought
of
the
treat
in
store
they
reached
the
camp
where
the
drover
cook
with
countenance
all
serene
was
boiling
beef
in
an
iron
pot
but
never
a
fowl
was
seen
off
the
beef
from
the
fire
said
bill
wait
till
you
see
the
fight
there
something
fresh
for
the
there
stew
for
mister
hall
has
a
fighting
cock
all
feathered
and
clipped
and
spurred
and
he
fetched
him
here
for
a
bit
of
sport
to
fight
our
australian
bird
i
made
a
match
that
our
pet
will
win
though
he
hardly
a
fighting
cock
but
he
game
enough
and
it
many
a
mile
that
he
tramped
with
the
travelling
stock
the
cook
he
banged
on
a
saucepan
lid
and
soon
as
the
sound
was
heard
under
the
dray
in
the
shadows
hid
a
something
moved
and
stirred
a
great
tame
emu
strutted
out
said
saltbush
our
bird
but
rooster
hall
and
his
cronies
two
drove
home
without
a
word
the
passing
stranger
within
his
gates
that
camps
with
old
rooster
hall
must
talk
about
something
else
than
fowls
if
he
wishes
to
talk
at
all
for
the
record
lies
in
the
local
court
and
filed
in
its
deepest
vault
that
peter
hall
of
the
take
down
was
tried
for
a
fierce
assault
on
a
stranger
man
who
in
all
good
faith
and
prompted
by
what
he
heard
had
asked
old
hall
if
a
british
game
could
beat
an
australian
bird
and
old
mccrae
who
was
on
the
bench
as
soon
as
the
case
was
tried
remarked
with
a
clean
discharge
the
assault
was
justified
hay
and
hell
and
booligal
come
and
see
me
boys
he
said
find
a
welcome
and
a
bed
and
whisky
any
time
you
call
although
our
township
has
got
the
name
of
quite
a
lively
spot
you
see
i
live
in
booligal
people
have
an
awful
down
upon
the
district
and
the
town
which
worse
than
hell
itself
they
call
in
fact
the
saying
far
and
wide
along
the
riverina
side
is
hay
and
hell
and
booligal
doubt
it
suits
very
well
to
say
it
worse
than
hay
or
hell
but
do
you
heed
their
talk
at
all
of
course
there
heat
no
one
denies
and
sand
and
dust
and
stacks
of
flies
and
rabbits
too
at
booligal
such
a
pleasant
quiet
place
you
never
see
a
stranger
face
they
hardly
ever
care
to
call
the
drovers
mostly
pass
it
by
they
reckon
that
they
rather
die
than
spend
a
night
in
booligal
big
mosquitoes
frighten
some
you
lie
awake
to
hear
hum
and
snakes
about
the
township
crawl
but
shearers
when
they
get
their
cheque
they
never
come
along
and
wreck
the
blessed
town
of
booligal
down
in
hay
the
shearers
come
and
fill
themselves
with
and
chase
blue
devils
up
the
wall
and
fight
the
snaggers
every
day
until
there
is
the
deuce
to
pay
there
none
of
that
in

course
there
is
much
to
see
the
used
to
be
the
great
attraction
for
us
all
until
some
careless
drunken
curs
got
sleeping
on
it
in
their
spurs
and
ruined
it
in
booligal
now
there
is
a
howling
drought
that
pretty
near
has
starved
us
out
it
never

to

at
all

if
there
should
come
any
rain
you
could
cross
the
plain
you
have

in

from

a
walgett
episode
the
sun
strikes
down
with
a
blinding
glare
the
skies
are
blue
and
the
plains
are
wide
the
saltbush
plains
that
are
burnt
and
bare
by
walgett
out
on
the
barwon
side
the
barwon
river
that
wanders
down
in
a
leisurely
manner
by
walgett
town
there
came
a
stranger
a
the
word
means
farmer
as
all
men
know
who
dwell
in
the
land
where
the
kangaroo
barks
loud
at
dawn
and
the
crow
uplifts
his
song
on
the
fence
as
he
watches
the
lambkins
passing
hence
the
sunburnt
stranger
was
gaunt
and
brown
but
it
soon
appeared
that
he
meant
to
flout
the
iron
law
of
the
country
town
which
is
that
the
stranger
has
got
to
shout
he
will
not
shout
we
must
take
him
down
remarked
the
yokels
of
walgett
town
they
baited
a
trap
with
a
crafty
bait
with
a
crafty
bait
for
they
held
discourse
concerning
a
new
chum
who
of
late
had
bought
such
a
thoroughly
lazy
horse
they
would
wager
that
no
one
could
ride
him
down
the
length
of
the
city
of
walgett
town
the
stranger
was
born
on
a
horse
hide
so
he
took
the
wagers
and
made
them
good
with
his
cash
but
his
hopes
they
died
for
the
horse
was
a
made
of
wood
was
a
horse
that
had
taken
down
full
many
a
stranger
in
walgett
town
the
stranger
smiled
with
a
sickly
smile
is
a
sickly
smile
that
the
loser
grins
and
he
said
he
had
travelled
for
quite
a
while
in
trying
to
sell
some
marsupial
skins
i
thought
that
perhaps
as
you
took
me
down
you
would
buy
them
from
me
in
walgett
town
he
said
that
his
home
was
at
wingadee
at
wingadee
where
he
had
for
sale
some
fifty
skins
and
would
guarantee
they
were
skins
with
the
ears
and
tail
complete
and
he
sold
them
for
money
down
to
a
venturesome
buyer
in
walgett
town
then
he
smiled
a
smile
as
he
pouched
the
pelf
glad
that
i
quit
of
them
win
or
lose
you
can
fetch
them
in
when
it
suits
yourself
and
you
find
the
skins
on
the
kangaroos
then
he
left
and
the
silence
settled
down
like
a
tangible
thing
upon
walgett
town
father
riley
horse
was
the
horse
thief
andy
regan
that
was
hunted
like
a
dog
by
the
troopers
of
the
upper
murray
side
they
had
searched
in
every
gully
they
had
looked
in
every
log
but
never
sight
or
track
of
him
they
spied
till
the
priest
at
kiley
crossing
heard
a
knocking
very
late
and
a
whisper
riley
come
across
so
his
in
pyjamas
trotted
softly
to
the
gate
and
admitted
andy
regan
and
a
horse
it
listen
father
riley
to
the
words
i
got
to
say
for
its
close
upon
my
death
i
am
with
the
troopers
hard
behind
me
i
been
hiding
all
the
day
in
the
gullies
keeping
close
and
out
of
sight
but
they
watching
all
the
ranges
till
there
not
a
bird
could
fly
and
i
fairly
worn
to
pieces
with
the
strife
so
i
taking
no
more
trouble
but
i
going
home
to
die
is
the
only
way
i
see
to
save
my
life
i
making
home
to
mother
and
i
die
o
tuesday
next
an
be
buried
on
the
thursday
and
of
course
i
prepared
to
meet
my
penance
but
with
one
thing
i
perplexed
and
it
father
it
this
jewel
of
a
horse
he
was
never
bought
nor
paid
for
and
there
not
a
man
can
swear
to
his
owner
or
his
breeder
but
i
know
that
his
sire
was
by
pedantic
from
the
old
pretender
mare
and
his
dam
was
close
related
to
the
roe
there
nothing
in
the
district
that
can
race
him
for
a
step
he
could
canter
while
they
going
at
their
top
he
the
king
of
all
the
leppers
that
was
ever
seen
to
lep
a
fence
he
clear
it
in
a
hop
so
i
leave
him
with
you
father
till
the
dead
shall
rise
again
is
yourself
that
knows
a
good
and
of
course
you
can
say
he
got
by
moonlight
out
of
paddy
murphy
plain
if
you
ever
asked
the
breeding
of
the
horse
it
getting
on
to
daylight
and
it
time
to
say
for
the
stars
above
the
east
are
growing
pale
and
i
making
home
to
mother
and
it
hard
for
me
to
die
but
it
harder
still
is
keeping
out
of
gaol
you
can
ride
the
old
horse
over
to
my
grave
across
the
dip
where
the
wattle
bloom
is
waving
overhead
sure
he
jump
them
fences
easy
you
must
never
raise
the
whip
or
he
rush
now
and
he
had
fled
so
they
buried
andy
regan
and
they
buried
him
to
rights
in
the
graveyard
at
the
back
of
kiley
hill
there
were
mourners
who
had
fights
till
the
very
boldest
fighters
had
their
fill
there
were
fifty
horses
racing
from
the
graveyard
to
the
pub
and
their
riders
flogged
each
other
all
the
while
and
the
lashins
of
the
liquor
and
the
lavins
of
the
grub
oh
poor
andy
went
to
rest
in
proper
style
then
the
races
came
to
kiley
with
a
steeplechase
and
all
for
the
folk
were
mostly
irish
round
about
and
it
takes
an
irish
rider
to
be
fearless
of
a
fall
they
were
training
morning
in
and
morning
out
but
they
never
started
training
till
the
sun
was
on
the
course
for
a
superstitious
story
kept
back
that
the
ghost
of
andy
regan
on
a
slashing
chestnut
horse
had
been
training
by
the
starlight
on
the
track
and
they
read
the
nominations
for
the
races
with
surprise
and
amusement
at
the
father
little
joke
for
a
novice
had
been
entered
for
the
steeplechasing
prize
and
they
found
that
it
was
father
riley
moke
he
was
neat
enough
to
gallop
he
was
strong
enough
to
stay
but
his
owner
views
of
training
were
immense
for
the
reverend
father
riley
used
to
ride
him
every
day
and
he
never
saw
a
hurdle
nor
a
fence
and
the
priest
would
join
the
laughter
said
he
put
him
in
for
there
five
and
twenty
sovereigns
to
be
won
and
the
poor
would
find
it
useful
if
the
chestnut
chanced
to
win
and
he
maybe
win
when
all
is
said
and
done
he
had
called
him
which
is
french
for
clear
the
course
and
his
colours
were
a
vivid
shade
of
green
all
the
dooleys
and
were
on
father
riley
horse
while
the
orangemen
were
backing
mandarin
it
was
hogan
the
dog
poisoner
aged
man
and
very
wise
who
was
camping
in
the
racecourse
with
his
swag
and
who
ventured
the
opinion
to
the
township
great
surprise
that
the
race
would
go
to
father
riley
nag
can
talk
about
your
riders
and
the
horse
has
not
been
schooled
and
the
fences
is
terrific
and
the
rest
when
the
field
is
fairly
going
then
ye
see
ye
all
been
fooled
and
the
chestnut
horse
will
battle
with
the
best
there
some
has
got
condition
and
they
think
the
race
is
sure
and
the
chestnut
horse
will
fall
beneath
the
weight
but
the
hopes
of
all
the
helpless
and
the
prayers
of
all
the
poor
will
be
running
by
his
side
to
keep
him
straight
and
it
what
the
need
of
schoolin
or
of
workin
on
the
track
whin
the
saints
are
there
to
guide
him
round
the
course
i
prayed
him
over
every
fence
i
prayed
him
out
and
back
and
i
bet
my
cash
on
father
riley
horse
oh
the
steeple
was
a
caution
they
went
tearin
round
and
round
and
the
fences
rang
and
rattled
where
they
struck
there
was
some
that
cleared
the
water
there
was
more
fell
in
and
drowned
some
blamed
the
men
and
others
blamed
the
luck
but
the
whips
were
flying
freely
when
the
field
came
into
view
for
the
finish
down
the
long
green
stretch
of
course
and
in
front
of
all
the
flyers
jumpin
like
a
kangaroo
came
the
rank
outsider
father
riley
horse
oh
the
shouting
and
the
cheering
as
he
rattled
past
the
post
for
he
left
the
others
standing
in
the
straight
and
the
rider
well
they
reckoned
it
was
andy
regan
ghost
and
it
beat
how
a
ghost
would
draw
the
weight
but
he
weighed
it
nine
stone
seven
then
he
laughed
and
disappeared
like
a
banshee
which
is
spanish
for
an
elf
and
old
hogan
muttered
sagely
it
was
for
the
beard
they
be
thinking
it
was
andy
regan
self
and
the
poor
of
kiley
crossing
drank
the
health
at
christmastide
of
the
chestnut
and
his
rider
dressed
in
green
there
was
never
such
a
rider
not
since
andy
regan
died
and
they
wondered
who
on
earth
he
could
have
been
but
they
settled
it
among
for
the
story
got
about
the
bushmen
and
the
people
on
the
course
that
the
devil
had
been
ordered
to
let
andy
regan
out
for
the
steeplechase
on
father
riley
horse
the
scotch
engineer
with
eyes
that
searched
in
the
dark
peering
along
the
line
stood
the
grim
scotchman
hector
clark
driver
of
and
the
flamed
on
the
hills
ahead
like
a
beacon
sign
there
was
word
of
a
fight
to
the
north
and
a
column
so
they
started
the
highlanders
forth
without
food
without
rest
but
the
pipers
gaily
played
chanting
their
fierce
delight
and
the
armoured
carriages
rocked
and
swayed
laden
with
men
of
the
scotch
brigade
hurrying
up
to
the
fight
and
the
grim
grey
highland
engineer
driving
them
into
the
night
then
a
signal
light
glowed
red
and
a
picket
came
to
the
track
holding
the
line
ahead
three
of
our
mates
we
have
left
for
dead
only
we
two
got
back
and
far
to
the
north
through
the
still
night
air
they
heard
the
rifles
crack
and
the
boom
of
a
gun
rang
out
like
the
sound
of
a
deep
appeal
and
the
picket
stood
in
doubt
by
the
side
of
the
but
the
engineer
looked
down
with
his
hand
on
the
ye
back
to
the
town
ye
know
what
my
orders
are
maybe
they
wanting
the
scotch
brigade
up
on
those
hills
afar
am
no
soldier
at
all
only
an
engineer
but
i
could
not
bear
that
the
folk
should
say
over
in
scotland
glasgow
way
that
hector
clark
stayed
here
with
the
scotch
brigade
till
the
foe
were
gone
with
ever
a
rail
to
run
her
on
ready
behind
stand
clear
get
you
gone
into
the
armoured
train
i
will
drive
her
alone
one
more
trip
and
perhaps
the
last
with
a
fire
and
an
open
blast
hark
to
the
rifles
on
through
the
choking
dark
never
a
lamp
nor
a
light
never
an
engine
spark
showing
her
hurried
flight
over
the
lonely
plain
rushed
the
great
armoured
train
hurrying
up
to
the
fight
then
with
her
living
freight
on
to
the
foe
she
came
and
the
rifles
snapped
their
hate
and
the
darkness
spouted
flame
over
the
roar
of
the
fray
the
hungry
bullets
whined
as
she
dashed
through
the
foe
that
lay
loading
and
firing
blind
till
the
glare
of
the
furnace
burning
clear
showed
them
the
form
of
the
engineer
sharply
and
well
defined
through
they
were
safely
through
hark
to
the
column
cheer
surely
the
driver
knew
he
was
to
halt
her
here
but
he
took
no
heed
of
the
signals
red
and
the
fireman
found
when
he
climbed
ahead
there
on
the
floor
of
his
engine
dead
lay
the
scotch
engineer
song
of
the
future
is
strange
that
in
a
land
so
strong
so
strong
and
bold
in
mighty
youth
we
have
no
poet
voice
of
truth
to
sing
for
us
a
wondrous
song
our
chiefest
singer
yet
has
sung
in
wild
sweet
notes
a
passing
strain
all
carelessly
and
sadly
flung
to
that
dull
world
he
thought
so
vain
care
for
nothing
good
nor
bad
my
hopes
are
gone
my
pleasures
fled
i
am
but
sifting
sand
he
said
what
wonder
gordon
songs
were
sad
and
yet
not
always
sad
and
hard
in
cheerful
mood
and
light
of
heart
he
told
the
tale
of
britomarte
and
wrote
the
rhyme
of
joyous
guard
and
some
have
said
that
nature
face
to
us
is
always
sad
but
these
have
never
felt
the
smiling
grace
of
waving
grass
and
forest
trees
on
sunlit
plains
as
wide
as
seas
land
where
dull
despair
is
king
scentless
flower
and
songless
bird
but
we
have
heard
the
ring
their
silver
bells
at
eventide
like
fairies
on
the
mountain
side
the
sweetest
note
man
ever
heard
the
wild
thrush
lifts
a
note
of
mirth
the
bronzewing
pigeons
call
and
coo
beside
their
nests
the
long
day
through
the
magpie
warbles
clear
and
strong
a
joyous
glad
thanksgiving
song
for
all
god
mercies
upon
earth
and
many
voices
such
as
these
are
joyful
sounds
for
those
to
tell
who
know
the
bush
and
love
it
well
with
all
its
hidden
mysteries
we
can
not
love
the
restless
sea
that
rolls
and
tosses
to
and
fro
like
some
fierce
creature
in
its
glee
for
human
weal
or
human
woe
it
has
no
touch
of
sympathy
for
us
the
bush
is
never
sad
its
myriad
voices
whisper
low
in
tones
the
bushmen
only
know
its
sympathy
and
welcome
glad
for
us
the
roving
breezes
bring
from
many
a
tree
where
wild
bees
murmur
dreamily
the
breath
of
we
have
no
tales
of
other
days
no
bygone
history
to
tell
our
tales
are
told
where
blaze
at
midnight
when
the
solemn
hush
of
that
vast
wonderland
the
bush
hath
laid
on
every
heart
its
spell
although
we
have
no
songs
of
strife
of
bloodshed
reddening
the
land
we
yet
may
find
achievements
grand
within
the
bushman
quiet
life
lift
ye
your
faces
to
the
sky
ye
far
blue
mountains
of
the
west
who
lie
so
peacefully
at
rest
enshrouded
in
a
haze
of
blue
is
hard
to
feel
that
years
went
by
before
the
pioneers
broke
through
your
rocky
heights
and
walls
of
stone
and
made
your
secrets
all
their
own
for
years
the
fertile
western
plains
were
hid
behind
your
sullen
walls
your
cliffs
and
crags
and
waterfalls
all
weatherworn
with
tropic
rains
between
the
mountains
and
the
sea
like
israelites
with
staff
in
hand
the
people
waited
restlessly
they
looked
towards
the
mountains
old
and
saw
the
sunsets
come
and
go
with
gorgeous
golden
afterglow
that
made
the
west
a
fairyland
and
marvelled
what
that
west
might
be
of
which
such
wondrous
tales
were
told
for
tales
were
told
of
inland
seas
like
sullen
oceans
salt
and
dead
and
sandy
deserts
white
and
wan
where
never
trod
the
foot
of
man
nor
bird
went
winging
overhead
nor
ever
stirred
a
gracious
breeze
to
wake
the
silence
with
its
breath
a
land
of
loneliness
and
death
at
length
the
hardy
pioneers
by
rock
and
crag
found
out
the
way
and
woke
with
voices
of
a
silence
kept
for
years
and
years
upon
the
western
slope
they
stood
and
saw
a
wide
expanse
of
plain
as
far
as
eye
could
stretch
or
see
go
rolling
westward
endlessly
the
native
grasses
tall
as
grain
were
waved
and
rippled
in
the
breeze
from
boughs
of
trees
the
parrots
answered
back
again
they
saw
the
land
that
it
was
good
a
land
of
fatness
all
untrod
and
gave
their
silent
thanks
to
god
the
way
is
won
the
way
is
won
and
straightway
from
the
barren
coast
there
came
a
host
that
aye
and
ever
onward
prest
with
eager
faces
to
the
west
along
the
pathway
of
the
sun
the
mountains
saw
them
marching
by
they
faced
the
drought
they
would
not
rest
in
settled
land
but
taking
each
his
life
in
hand
their
faces
ever
westward
bent
beyond
the
farthest
settlement
responding
to
the
challenge
cry
of
country
further
out
and
lo
a
miracle
the
land
but
yesterday
was
all
unknown
the
wild
man
boomerang
was
thrown
where
now
great
busy
cities
stand
it
was
not
much
you
say
that
these
should
win
their
way
where
none
withstood
in
sooth
there
was
not
much
of
blood
no
war
was
fought
between
the
seas
it
was
not
much
but
we
who
know
the
strange
capricious
land
they
trod
at
times
a
stricken
parching
sod
at
times
with
raging
floods
beset
through
which
they
found
their
lonely
way
are
quite
content
that
you
should
say
it
was
not
much
while
we
can
feel
that
nothing
in
the
ages
old
in
song
or
story
written
yet
on
grecian
urn
or
roman
arch
though
it
should
ring
with
clash
of
steel
could
braver
histories
unfold
than
this
bush
story
yet
untold
the
story
of
their
westward
but
times
are
changed
and
changes
rung
from
old
to
new
the
olden
days
the
old
bush
life
and
all
its
ways
are
passing
from
us
all
unsung
the
freedom
and
the
hopeful
sense
of
toil
that
brought
due
recompense
of
room
for
all
has
passed
away
and
lies
forgotten
with
the
dead
within
our
streets
men
cry
for
bread
in
cities
built
but
yesterday
about
us
stretches
wealth
of
land
a
boundless
wealth
of
virgin
soil
as
yet
unfruitful
and
untilled
our
willing
workmen
strong
and
skilled
within
our
cities
idle
stand
and
cry
aloud
for
leave
to
toil
the
stunted
children
come
and
go
in
squalid
lanes
and
alleys
black
we
follow
but
the
beaten
track
of
other
nations
and
we
grow
in
wealth
for
some
for
many
woe
and
it
may
be
that
we
who
live
in
this
new
land
apart
beyond
the
hard
old
world
grown
fierce
and
fond
and
bound
by
precedent
and
bond
may
read
the
riddle
right
and
give
new
hope
to
those
who
dimly
see
that
all
things
may
be
yet
for
good
and
teach
the
world
at
length
to
be
one
vast
united
so
may
it
be
and
he
who
sings
in
accents
hopeful
clear
and
strong
the
glories
which
that
future
brings
shall
sing
indeed
a
song
anthony

out
where
the
white
stars
shine
grim
and
silent
as
such
men
be
rideth
a

with
a

anthony
considine
for
the
ways
of
men
they
are
manifold
as
their
differing
views
in
life
for
some
are
sold
for
the
lust
of
gold
and
some
for
the
lust
of
strife
but
this
man
counted
the
world
well
lost
for
the
love
of
his
neighbour
wife
they
fled
together
as
those
must
flee
whom
all
men
hold
in
blame
each
to
the

must
all
things
be
who
cross
the
gulf
of
iniquity
and
live
in
the
land
of
shame
but
a
if

sins
with

she
sinneth
with
the
rule
holds
good
since
the

since
ever
the

the

anthony
considine
a
nobler
spirit
had
turned
in
scorn
from
a
love
that
was
stained
with
mire
a
weaker
being
might
mourn
and
mourn
for
the
loss
of
his
heart
desire
but
the
anger
of
anthony
considine
blazed
up
like
a
flaming
fire
and
she
with
her
new
love
presently
came
past
with
her
eyes
ashine
and
god
so
willed
it
and
god
knows
why
she
turned
and
laughed
as
they
passed
him
by
anthony
considine
her
laughter
stung
as
a
whip
might
sting
and
mad
with
his
wounded
pride
he
turned
and
sprang
with
a
panther
spring
and
struck
at
his
rival
side
and
only
the
woman
shuddering
could
tell
how
the
dead
man
died
she
dared
not
speak
and
the
mystery
is
buried
in
auld
lang
syne
but
out
on

grim
and

a
drought
but
we
sick
of
prayers
and
providence
we
going
to
do
without
with
the
derricks
up
above
us
and
the
solid
earth
below
we
are
waiting
at
the
lever
for
the
word
to
let
her
go
sinking
down
deeper
down
oh
we
sink
it
deeper
down
as
the
drill
is
plugging
downward
at
a
thousand
feet
of
level
if
the
lord
wo
send
us
water
oh
we
get
it
from
the
devil
yes
we
get
it
from
the
devil
deeper
down
now
our
engine
built
in
glasgow
by
a
very
canny
scot
and
he
marked
it
twenty
but
he
do
know
what
is
what
when
canadian
bill
is
firing
with
the
gidgee
logs
she
can
equal
thirty
horses
and
a
score
or
so
of
dogs
sinking

deeper
down
oh
we
going
deeper
down
if
we
fail
to
get
the
water
then
it
ruin
to
the
squatter
for
the
drought
is
on
the
station
and
the
weather
growing
hotter
but
we
bound
to
get
the
water
deeper
down
but
the
shaft
has
started
caving
and
the
sinking
very
slow
and
the
yellow
rods
are
bending
in
the
water
down
below
and
the
tubes
are
always
jamming
and
they
ca
be
made
to
shift
till
we
nearly
burst
the
engine
with
a
forty
lift
sinking
down
deeper
down
oh
we
going
deeper
down
though
the
shaft
is
always
caving
and
the
tubes
are
always
jamming
yet
we
fight
our
way
to
water
while
the
stubborn
drill
is
ramming
while
the
stubborn
drill
is
ramming
deeper
down
but
there
no
artesian
water
though
we
passed
three
thousand
feet
and
the
contract
price
is
growing
and
the
boss
is
nearly
beat
but
it
must
be
down
beneath
us
and
it
down
we
got
to
go
though
she
bumping
on
the
solid
rock
four
thousand
feet
below
sinking
down
deeper
down
oh
we
going
deeper
down
and
it
time
they
heard
us
knocking
on
the
roof
of
satan
dwellin
but
we
get
artesian
water
if
we
cave
the
roof
of
hell
in
oh
we
get
artesian
water
deeper
down
but
it
hark
the
whistle
blowing
with
a
wild
exultant
blast
and
the
boys
are
madly
cheering
for
they
struck
the
flow
at
last
and
it
rushing
up
the
tubing
from
four
thousand
feet
below
till
it
spouts
above
the
casing
in
a
flow
and
it
down
deeper
down
oh
it
comes
from
deeper
down
it
is
flowing
ever
flowing
in
a
free
unstinted
measure
from
the
silent
hidden
places
where
the
old
earth
hides
her
treasure
where
the
old
earth
hides
her
treasure
deeper
down
and
it
clear
away
the
timber
and
it
let
the
water
run
how
it
glimmers
in
the
shadow
how
it
flashes
in
the
sun
by
the
silent
belts
of
timber
by
the
miles
of
blazing
plain
it
is
bringing
hope
and
comfort
to
the
thirsty
land
again
flowing
down
further
down
it
is
flowing
further
down
to
the
tortured
thirsty
cattle
bringing
gladness
in
its
going
through
the
droughty
days
of
summer
it
is
flowing
ever
flowing
it
is
flowing
ever
flowing
further
down
a
disqualified
jockey
story
you
see
the
thing
was
this
way
there
was
me
that
rode
panoppoly
the
splendor
mare
and
ikey
chambers
on
the
iron
dook
and
smith
the
rider
on
regret
and
that
long
bloke
from
wagga
him
what
rode
veronikew
the
snowy
river
horse
well
none
of
them
had
chances
not
a
chance
among
the
lot
unless
the
rest
fell
dead
or
was
trying
for
a
blind
man
dog
could
see
enchantress
was
a
certain
cop
and
all
the
books
was
layin
six
to
four
they
brought
her
out
to
show
our
lot
the
road
or
so
they
said
but
then
gord
truth
you
know
you
ca
believe
though
they
took
an
oath
on
forty
bibles
that
they
tell
the
truth
but
anyhow
an
amateur
was
up
on
this
enchantress
and
so
ike
and
me
we
thought
that
we
might
frighten
him
a
bit
by
asking
if
he
minded
riding
rough
not
at
all
says
he
not
at
all
i
learnt
at
robbo
park
and
if
it
comes
to
bumping
i
your
moses
strike
me
blue
says
he
bump
you
over
either
rail
the
inside
rail
or
outside
which
you
choose
is
good
enough
for
me
which
settled
ike
for
he
was
shaky
since
he
near
got
killed
from
being
sent
a
buster
on
the
rail
when
some
chap
bumped
his
horse
and
fetched
him
down
at
stony
bridge
so
ikey
thought
it
best
to
leave
this
bloke
alone
and
i
agreed
so
all
the
books
was
layin
six
to
four
against
the
favourite
and
the
amateur
was
walking
this
enchantress
up
and
down
and
me
and
smithy
backed
him
for
we
thought
we
might
as
well
get
something
for
ourselves
because
we
knew
our
horses
could
win
but
ikey
would
back
him
for
a
bob
because
he
said
he
reckoned
he
was
stiff
and
all
the
books
was
layin
six
to
four
well
anyhow
before
the
start
the
news
got
round
that
this
here
amateur
was
stiff
and
our
good
stuff
was
blued
and
all
the
books
was
in
it
and
the
prices
lengthened
out
and
every
book
was
bustin
of
his
throat
and
layin
five
to
one
the
favourite
so
there
was
we
that
could
win
ourselves
and
this
here
amateur
that
would
try
and
all
the
books
was
layin
five
to
one
so
smithy
says
to
me
take
a
hold
of
that
there
moke
of
yours
and
round
the
turn
come
up
behind
enchantress
with
the
whip
and
let
her
have
it
that
long
bloke
and
me
will
wait
ahead
and
when
she
comes
to
us
we
pass
her
on
and
belt
her
down
the
straight
and
ikey
flog
her
home
because
his
boss
is
judge
and
steward
and
the
lord
knows
what
and
so
he
wo
be
touched
and
as
for
us
we
swear
we
only
hit
her
by
mistake
and
all
the
books
was
layin
five
to
one
well
off
we
went
and
comin
to
the
turn
i
saw
the
amateur
was
holding
back
and
poking
into
every
hole
he
could
to
get
her
blocked
and
so
i
pulled
behind
and
drew
the
whip
and
dropped
it
on
the
mare
i
let
her
have
it
twice
and
then
she
shot
ahead
of
me
and
smithy
opened
out
and
let
her
up
beside
him
on
the
rails
and
kept
her
there
her
like
smoke
until
she
struggled
past
him
pullin
hard
and
came
to
ike
but
ikey
drew
his
whip
and
hit
her
on
the
nose
and
sent
her
back
and
won
the
race
himself
for
after
all
it
seems
he
had
a
fiver
on
the
dook
and
never
told
us
so
our
stuff
was
lost
and
then
they
had
us
up
for
ridin
foul
and
warned
us
off
the
tracks
for
twelve
months
each
to
get
our
livin
any
way
we
could
but
ikey
was
touched
because
his
boss
was
judge
and
steward
and
the
lord
knows
what
but
mister
if
you
lend
us
i
know
three
certain
winners
at
the
park
three
certain
cops
as
no
one
knows
but
me
and
thank
you
mister
come
an
have
a
beer
i
always
like
a
beer
about
this
time
well
so
long
mister
till
we
meet
again
the
road
to
gundagai
the
mountain
road
goes
up
and
down
from
gundagai
to
tumut
town
and
branching
off
there
runs
a
track
across
the
foothills
grim
and
black
across
the
plains
and
ranges
grey
to
sydney
city
far
it
came
by
chance
one
day
that
i
from
tumut
rode
to
gundagai
and
reached
about
the
evening
tide
the
crossing
where
the
roads
divide
and
waiting
at
the
crossing
place
i
saw
a
maiden
fair
of
face
with
eyes
of
deepest
violet
blue
and
cheeks
to
match
the
rose
in
hue
the
fairest
maids
australia
knows
are
bred
among
the
mountain
snows
then
fearing
i
might
go
astray
i
asked
if
she
could
show
the
way
her
voice
might
well
a
man
bewitch
its
tones
so
supple
deep
and
rich
tracks
are
clear
she
made
reply
this
goes
down
to
sydney
town
and
that
one
goes
to
gundagai
then
slowly
looking
coyly
back
she
went
along
the
sydney
track
and
i
for
one
was
well
content
to
go
the
road
the
lady
went
but
round
the
turn
a
swain
she
met
the
kiss
she
gave
him
haunts
me
yet
i
turned
and
travelled
with
a
sigh
the
lonely
road
to
gundagai
saltbush
bill
second
fight
the
news
came
down
on
the
castlereagh
and
went
to
the
world
at
large
that
twenty
thousand
travelling
sheep
with
saltbush
bill
in
charge
were
drifting
down
from
a
run
to
ravage
the
castlereagh
and
the
squatters
swore
when
they
heard
the
news
and
wished
they
were
well
away
for
the
name
and
the
fame
of
saltbush
bill
were
over
the
country
side
for
the
wonderful
way
that
he
fed
his
sheep
and
the
dodges
and
tricks
he
tried
he
would
lose
his
way
on
a
main
stock
route
and
stray
to
the
squatters
grass
he
would
come
to
a
run
with
the
boss
away
and
swear
he
had
leave
to
pass
and
back
of
all
and
behind
it
all
as
well
the
squatters
knew
if
he
had
to
fight
he
would
fight
all
day
so
long
as
his
sheep
got
through
but
this
is
the
story
of
stingy
smith
the
owner
of
hard
times
hill
and
the
way
that
he
chanced
on
a
fighting
man
to
reckon
with
saltbush
was
stingy
smith
on
his
stockyard
sat
and
prayed
for
an
early
spring
when
he
stared
at
sight
of
a
tramp
who
walked
with
jaunty
swing
for
a
tramp
with
a
jaunty
walk
along
the
track
is
as
rare
a
thing
as
a
feathered
frog
on
the
desolate
roads
out
back
so
the
tramp
he
made
for
the
travellers
hut
and
asked
could
he
camp
the
night
but
stingy
smith
had
a
bright
idea
and
he
said
to
him
you
fight
what
the
game
said
the
tramp
as
he
looked
at
him
up
and
down
you
want
a
battle
get
off
that
fence
and
i
kill
you
for
but
boss
you
better
not
fight
with
me
it
would
be
fair
nor
right
i
stiffener
joe
from
the
rocks
brigade
and
i
killed
a
man
in
a
fight
i
served
two
years
for
it
fair
and
square
and
now
i
a
trampin
back
to
look
for
a
peaceful
quiet
life
away
on
the
outside
track
it
not
myself
but
a
drover
chap
said
stingy
smith
with
glee
bullying
fellow
called
saltbush
bill
and
you
are
the
man
for
me
he
on
the
road
with
his
hungry
sheep
and
he
certain
to
raise
a
row
for
he
bullied
the
whole
of
the
castlereagh
till
he
got
them
under
cow
just
pick
a
quarrel
and
raise
a
fight
and
leather
him
good
and
hard
and
i
take
good
care
that
his
wretched
sheep
do
wander
a
half
a
yard
it
a
job
if
you
belt
him
well
do
anything
short
of
kill
for
there
is
a
beak
on
the
castlereagh
will
fine
you
for
saltbush
bill
take
the
job
said
the
fighting
man
hot
as
this
cove
appears
he
stand
no
chance
with
a
bloke
like
me
what
lived
on
the
game
for
years
for
he
maybe
learnt
in
a
boxing
school
and
sparred
for
a
round
or
so
but
i
fought
all
hands
in
a
ring
each
night
in
a
travelling
show
they
earned
a
pound
if
they
stayed
three
rounds
and
they
tried
for
it
every
night
in
a
ring
oh
that
the
game
that
teaches
a
bloke
to
fight
for
they
rush
and
clinch
it
was
dublin
rules
and
we
drew
no
colour
line
and
they
all
tried
hard
for
to
earn
the
pound
but
they
got
no
pound
of
mine
if
i
saw
no
chance
in
the
opening
round
i
slog
at
their
wind
and
wait
till
an
opening
came
and
it
always
came
and
i
settled
sure
as
fate
left
on
the
ribs
and
right
on
the
jaw
and
when
the
chance
comes
make
sure
and
it
there
a
professional
bloke
like
me
gets
home
on
an
amateur
for
it
my
experience
every
day
and
i
make
no
doubt
it
yours
that
a
pro
is
an
for
the
best
of
the
amateurs
take
your
swag
to
the
travellers
hut
said
smith
you
waste
your
breath
you
a
chance
if
you
lose
the
fight
of
talking
your
man
to
death
i
tell
the
cook
you
to
have
your
grub
and
see
that
you
eat
your
fill
and
come
to
the
scratch
all
fit
and
well
to
leather
this
saltbush
was
saltbush
bill
and
his
travelling
sheep
were
wending
their
weary
way
on
the
main
stock
route
through
the
hard
times
run
on
their
stage
a
day
and
he
strayed
a
mile
from
the
main
stock
route
and
started
to
feed
along
and
when
stingy
smith
came
up
bill
said
that
the
route
was
surveyed
wrong
and
he
tried
to
prove
that
the
sheep
had
rushed
and
strayed
from
their
camp
at
night
but
the
fighting
man
he
kicked
bill
dog
and
of
course
that
meant
a
fight
so
they
sparred
and
fought
and
they
shifted
ground
and
never
a
sound
was
heard
but
the
thudding
fists
on
their
brawny
ribs
and
the
seconds
muttered
word
till
the
fighting
man
shot
home
his
left
on
the
ribs
with
a
mighty
clout
and
his
right
flashed
up
with
a
blow
and
saltbush
bill
out
he
fell
face
down
and
towards
the
blow
and
their
hearts
with
fear
were
filled
for
he
lay
as
still
as
a
fallen
tree
and
they
thought
that
he
must
be
killed
so
stingy
smith
and
the
fighting
man
they
lifted
him
from
the
ground
and
sent
to
home
for
a
and
they
slowly
fetched
him
round
but
his
head
was
bad
and
his
jaw
was
hurt
in
fact
he
could
scarcely
speak
so
they
let
him
spell
till
he
got
his
wits
and
he
camped
on
the
run
a
week
while
the
travelling
sheep
went
here
and
there
wherever
they
liked
to
stray
till
saltbush
bill
was
fit
once
more
for
the
track
to
the
then
stingy
smith
he
wrote
a
note
and
gave
to
the
fighting
man
was
writ
to
the
boss
of
the
neighbouring
run
and
thus
the
missive
ran
man
with
this
is
a
fighting
man
one
stiffener
joe
by
name
he
came
near
murdering
saltbush
bill
and
i
found
it
a
costly
game
but
it
worth
your
while
to
employ
the
chap
for
there
is
the
slightest
doubt
you
have
no
trouble
from
saltbush
bill
while
this
man
hangs
about
but
an
answer
came
by
the
next
week
mail
with
news
that
might
well
appal
man
you
sent
with
a
note
is
not
a
fighting
man
at
all
he
has
shaved
his
beard
and
has
cut
his
hair
but
i
spotted
him
at
a
look
he
is
tom
devine
who
has
worked
for
years
for
saltbush
bill
as
cook
bill
coached
him
up
in
the
fighting
yarn
and
taught
him
the
tale
by
rote
and
they
shammed
to
fight
and
they
got
your
grass
and
divided
your
note
was
a
clean
and
you
find
it
wise
save
you
a
lot
of
pelf
when
next
you
hiring
a
fighting
man
just
fight
him
a
round
and
the
teamsters
out
on
the
castlereagh
when
they
meet
with
a
week
of
rain
and
the
waggon
sinks
to
its
deep
down
in
the
black
soil
plain
when
the
bullocks
wade
in
a
sea
of
mud
and
strain
at
the
load
of
wool
and
the
at
the
bullocks
heels
are
biting
to
make
them
pull
when
the
driver
flays
the
team
and
curses
them
while
he
flogs
and
the
air
is
thick
with
the
language
used
and
the
clamour
of
men
and
dogs
the
teamsters
say
as
they
pause
to
rest
and
moisten
each
hairy
throat
they
wish
they
could
swear
like
stingy
smith
when
he
read
that
neighbour
note
hard
luck
i
left
the
course
and
by
my
side
there
walked
a
ruined
tout
a
hungry
creature
who
poured
this
story
out
see
he
said
came
a
swell
to
kensington
and
if
i
picked
the
winners
well
a
crown
at
least
he
pay
picked
three
winners
straight
i
did
i
filled
his
purse
with
pelf
and
then
he
gave
me
to
back
one
for
myself
to
me
he
cast
i
wanted
it
indeed
so
help
me
bob
for
two
days
past
i
have
had
a
feed
still
i
thought
my
luck
was
in
i
could
go
astray
i
put
it
all
on
little
min
and
lost
it
straightaway
have
got
a
bite
or
bed
i
absolutely
stuck
so
keep
this
lesson
in
your
head
do
your
luck
the
folks
went
homeward
near
and
far
the
tout
oh
where
was
he
ask
where
the
empty
boilers
are
beside
the
circular
quay
song
of
the
federation
as
the
nations
sat
together
grimly
waiting
the
fierce
old
nations
grown
grey
in
their
lusting
and
their
hating
ever
armed
and
ever
ready
keeping
guard
through
the
tumult
of
their
warlike
preparation
and
the
clamour
of
the
drums
came
a
voice
crying
a
nation
to
her
place
in
the
sisterhood
she
comes
and
she
came
she
was
beautiful
as
morning
with
the
bloom
of
the
roses
in
her
mouth
like
a
young
queen
lavishly
adorning
her
charms
with
the
splendours
of
the
south
and
the
fierce
old
nations
looking
on
her
said
surely
she
were
quickly
overthrown
hath
she
strength
for
the
burden
laid
upon
her
hath
she
power
to
protect
and
guard
her
own
then
she
spoke
and
her
voice
was
clear
and
ringing
in
the
ears
of
the
nations
old
and
gray
saying
and
ye
shall
hear
my
children
singing
their
in
countries
far
away
they
are
strangers
to
the
tumult
of
the
battle
they
are
few
but
their
hearts
are
very
strong
was
but
yesterday
they
called
unto
the
cattle
but
they
now
sing
australia
marching
song
song
of
the
australians
in
action
for
the
honour
of
australia
our
mother
side
by
side
with
our
kin
from
over
sea
we
have
fought
and
we
have
tested
one
another
and
enrolled
among
the
brotherhood
are
we
there
was
never
post
of
danger
but
we
sought
it
in
the
fighting
through
the
fire
and
through
the
flood
there
was
never
prize
so
costly
but
we
bought
it
though
we
paid
for
its
purchase
with
our
blood
was
there
any
road
too
rough
for
us
to
travel
was
there
any
path
too
far
for
us
to
tread
you
can
track
us
by
the
blood
drops
on
the
gravel
on
the
roads
that
we
milestoned
with
our
dead
and
for
you
oh
our
young
and
anxious
mother
your
great
gains
keeping
watch
and
ward
neither
fearing
nor
despising
any
other
we
will
hold
your
possessions
with
the
then
they
passed
to
the
place
of
sleeping
the
figures
with
their
dead
to
the
sound
of
their
women
softly
weeping
and
the
dead
march
moaning
at
their
head
and
the
nations
as
the
grim
procession
ended
whispered
but
ye
have
seen
the
price
we
pay
from
war
may
we
ever
be
defended
kneel
ye
down
sister
let
us
pray
the
old
australian
ways
the
london
lights
are
far
abeam
behind
a
bank
of
cloud
along
the
shore
the
gaslights
gleam
the
gale
is
piping
loud
and
down
the
channel
groping
blind
we
drive
her
through
the
haze
towards
the
land
we
left
behind
the
good
old
land
of
mind
and
old
australian
ways
the
narrow
ways
of
english
folk
are
not
for
such
as
we
they
bear
the
yoke
of
staid
conservancy
but
all
our
roads
are
new
and
strange
and
through
our
blood
there
runs
the
vagabonding
love
of
change
that
drove
us
westward
of
the
range
and
westward
of
the
suns
the
city
folk
go
to
and
fro
behind
a
prison
bars
they
never
feel
the
breezes
blow
and
never
see
the
stars
they
never
hear
in
blossomed
trees
the
music
low
and
sweet
of
wild
birds
making
melodies
nor
catch
the
little
laughing
breeze
that
whispers
in
the
wheat
our
fathers
came
of
roving
stock
that
could
not
fixed
abide
and
we
have
followed
field
and
flock
since
we
learnt
to
ride
by
miner
camp
and
shearing
shed
in
land
of
heat
and
drought
we
followed
where
our
fortunes
led
with
fortune
always
on
ahead
and
always
further
out
the
wind
is
in
the
the
wattles
are
in
bloom
the
breezes
greet
us
as
they
pass
with
perfume
the
parakeets
go
screaming
by
with
flash
of
golden
wing
and
from
the
swamp
the
cry
their
note
of
revelry
rejoicing
at
the
spring
so
throw
the
weary
pen
aside
and
let
the
papers
rest
for
we
must
saddle
up
and
ride
towards
the
blue
hill
breast
and
we
must
travel
far
and
fast
across
their
rugged
maze
to
find
the
spring
of
youth
at
last
and
call
back
from
the
buried
past
the
old
australian
ways
when
clancy
took
the
drover
track
in
years
of
long
ago
he
drifted
to
the
outer
back
beyond
the
overflow
by
rolling
plain
and
rocky
shelf
with
stockwhip
in
his
hand
he
reached
at
last
oh
lucky
elf
the
town
of
in
land
and
if
it
be
that
you
would
know
the
tracks
he
used
to
ride
then
you
must
saddle
up
and
go
beyond
the
queensland
side
beyond
the
reach
of
rule
or
law
to
ride
the
long
day
through
in
nature
homestead
filled
with
awe
you
then
might
see
what
clancy
saw
and
know
what
clancy
knew
the
ballad
of
the
by
the
far
samoan
shore
where
the
rollers
pour
all
the
wash
of
the
pacific
on
the
bay
riding
lightly
at
their
ease
in
the
calm
of
tropic
seas
the
three
great
nations
warships
at
their
anchors
proudly
lay
riding
lightly
head
to
wind
with
the
coral
reefs
behind
three
germans
and
three
yankee
ships
were
mirrored
in
the
blue
and
on
one
ship
unfurled
was
the
flag
that
rules
the
world
for
on
the
old
the
flag
of
england
flew
when
the
gentle
breeze
that
had
scarcely
stirred
the
trees
dropped
down
to
utter
stillness
and
the
glass
began
to
fall
away
across
the
main
lowered
the
coming
hurricane
and
far
away
to
seaward
hung
the
cloud
wrack
like
a
pall
if
the
word
had
passed
around
us
move
to
safer
ground
let
us
steam
away
to
seaward
then
this
tale
were
not
to
tell
but
each
captain
seemed
to
say
the
others
stay
i
stay
and
they
lingered
at
their
moorings
till
the
shades
of
evening
fell
then
the
cloud
wrack
neared
them
fast
and
there
came
a
sudden
blast
and
the
hurricane
came
leaping
down
a
thousand
miles
of
main
like
a
lion
on
its
prey
leapt
the
storm
fiend
on
the
bay
and
the
vessels
shook
and
shivered
as
their
cables
felt
the
strain
as
the
surging
seas
came
by
that
were
running
mountains
high
the
vessels
started
dragging
drifting
slowly
to
the
lee
and
the
darkness
of
the
night
hid
the
coral
reefs
from
sight
and
the
captains
dared
not
risk
the
chance
to
grope
their
way
to
sea
in
the
dark
they
dared
not
shift
they
were
forced
to
wait
and
drift
all
hands
stood
by
uncertain
would
the
anchors
hold
or
no
but
the
men
on
deck
could
see
if
a
chance
of
hope
might
be
there
was
little
chance
of
safety
for
the
men
who
were
below
through
that
long
long
night
of
dread
while
the
storm
raged
overhead
they
were
waiting
by
their
engines
with
the
furnace
fires
aroar
so
they
waited
staunch
and
true
though
they
knew
and
well
they
knew
they
must
drown
like
rats
imprisoned
if
the
vessel
touched
the
shore
when
the
grey
dawn
broke
at
last
and
the
long
long
night
was
past
while
the
hurricane
redoubled
lest
its
prey
should
steal
away
on
the
rocks
all
smashed
and
strewn
were
the
german
vessels
thrown
while
the
yankees
swamped
and
helpless
drifted
shorewards
down
the
bay
then
at
last
spoke
captain
kane
our
anchors
are
in
vain
and
the
germans
and
the
yankees
they
have
drifted
to
the
lee
cut
the
cables
at
the
bow
we
must
trust
the
engines
now
give
her
steam
and
let
her
have
it
lads
we
fight
her
out
to
sea
and
the
answer
came
with
cheers
from
the
stalwart
engineers
from
the
grim
and
grimy
firemen
at
the
furnaces
below
and
above
the
sullen
roar
of
the
breakers
on
the
shore
came
the
throbbing
of
the
engines
as
they
laboured
to
and
fro
if
the
strain
should
find
a
flaw
should
a
bolt
or
rivet
draw
then
god
help
them
for
the
vessel
were
a
plaything
in
the
tide
with
a
face
of
honest
cheer
quoth
an
english
engineer
will
answer
for
the
engines
that
were
built
on
old
thames
side
the
stays
and
stanchions
taut
for
the
rivets
truly
wrought
for
the
valves
that
fit
their
faces
as
a
glove
should
fit
the
hand
give
her
every
ounce
of
power
if
we
make
a
knot
an
hour
then
it
way
enough
to
steer
her
and
we
drive
her
from
the
land
like
a
foam
flake
tossed
and
thrown
she
could
barely
hold
her
own
while
the
other
ships
all
helplessly
were
drifting
to
the
lee
through
the
smother
and
the
rout
the
steamed
out
and
they
cheered
her
from
the
trenton
that
was
foundering
in
the
sea
aye
drifting
shoreward
there
all
helpless
as
they
were
their
vessel
hurled
upon
the
reefs
as
weed
ashore
is
hurled
without
a
thought
of
fear
the
yankees
raised
a
cheer
a
cheer
that
folk
should
echo
round
the
world
do
they
know
do
they
know
at
the
turn
to
the
straight
where
the
favourites
fail
and
every
atom
of
weight
is
telling
its
tale
as
some
grim
old
stayer
runs
true
to
his
breed
and
with
head
just
in
front
of
the
rest
fights
on
in
the
lead
when
the
jockeys
are
out
with
the
whips
with
a
furlong
to
go
and
the
backers
grow
white
to
the
lips
do
you
think
they
do
know
do
they
know
as
they
come
back
to
weigh
in
a
whirlwind
of
cheers
though
the
spurs
have
left
marks
of
the
fray
though
the
sweat
on
the
ears
gathers
cold
and
they
sob
with
distress
as
they
roll
up
the
track
they
know
just
as
well
their
success
as
the
man
on
their
back
as
they
walk
through
a
dense
human
lane
that
sways
to
and
fro
and
cheers
them
again
and
again
do
you
think
they
do
know
the
passing
of
gundagai
introdooce
a
friend
he
said
and
if
you
got
a
vacant
pen
you
better
take
him
in
the
shed
and
start
him
shearing
straight
ahead
he
one
of
these
here
quiet
men
never
strikes
that
ai
his
game
no
matter
what
the
others
try
he
goes
on
shearing
just
the
same
i
never
rightly
knew
his
name
we
always
call
him
gundagai
our
flashest
shearer
then
had
gone
to
train
a
racehorse
for
a
race
and
while
his
sporting
fit
was
on
he
could
be
relied
upon
so
shore
in
his
place
alas
for
man
veracity
for
reputations
false
and
true
this
turned
out
to
be
for
strife
and
villainy
the
very
worst
i
ever
knew
he
started
racing
jack
devine
and
grumbled
when
i
made
him
stop
the
pace
he
showed
was
extra
fine
but
all
those
ewes
of
mine
were
bleeding
like
a
butcher
shop
he
cursed
the
sheep
he
cursed
the
shed
from
roof
to
rafter
floor
to
shelf
as
for
my
mongrel
ewes
he
said
i
ought
to
get
a
razor
blade
and
shave
the
blooming
things
myself
on
sundays
he
controlled
a
and
played
the
livelong
day
and
many
a
young
confiding
fool
he
shore
of
his
financial
wool
and
when
he
lost
he
would
not
pay
he
organised
a
shearers
race
and
me
to
provide
the
prize
his
packhorse
showed
surprising
pace
and
won
hands
down
he
was
the
ace
a
racehorse
in
disguise
next
day
the
bruiser
of
the
shed
displayed
an
eye
with
large
contusions
on
his
head
he
smiled
a
sickly
smile
and
said
he
a
cut
at
gundagai
but
just
as
we
were
getting
full
of
and
all
his
ways
a
telegram
for
arrived
said
he
me
all
wool
let
see
what
this
here
message
says
he
opened
it
his
face
grew
white
he
dropped
the
shears
and
turned
away
it
ran
wife
took
bad
last
night
come
home
at
once
no
time
to
write
we
fear
she
may
not
last
the
day
he
got
his
cheque
i
did
care
to
dock
him
for
my
mangled
ewes
his
store
account
we
it
square
poor
wretch
he
had
enough
to
bear
confronted
by
such
dreadful
news
the
shearers
raised
a
little
purse
to
help
a
mate
as
shearers
will
pay
the
doctor
and
the
nurse
and
if
there
should
be
something
worse
to
pay
the
undertaker
bill
they
wrung
his
hand
in
sympathy
he
rode
away
without
a
word
his
head
hung
down
in
misery
a
wandering
hawker
passing
by
was
told
of
what
had
just
occurred
that
a
curious
thing
he
said
known
that
feller
all
his
life
he
had
the
loan
of
this
here
shed
i
know
his
wife
ai
nearly
dead
because
he
has
got
a
wife
you
should
have
heard
the
whipcord
crack
as
angry
shearers
galloped
by
in
vain
they
tried
to
fetch
him
back
a
little
dust
along
the
track
was
all
they
saw
of
the
wargeilah
handicap
wargeilah
town
is
very
small
there
no
cathedral
nor
a
club
in
fact
the
township
all
in
all
is
just
one
unpretentious
pub
and
there
from
all
the
stations
round
the
local
sportsmen
can
be
found
the
sportsmen
of
wargeilah
side
are
very
few
but
very
fit
there
scarcely
any
sport
been
tried
but
what
they
held
their
own
at
it
in
fact
to
search
their
records
they
held
their
own
and
something
more
was
round
about
wargeilah
town
an
english
did
infest
he
used
to
wander
up
and
down
in
baggy
english
breeches
drest
his
mental
aspect
seemed
to
be
just
stolid
the
local
sportsmen
vainly
sought
his
tranquil
calm
to
counteract
by
urging
that
he
should
be
brought
within
the
noxious
creatures
act
harm
him
not
said
one
more
wise
is
a
blessing
in
disguise
see
he
wants
to
buy
a
horse
to
ride
and
hunt
and
steeplechase
and
carry
ladies
too
of
course
and
pull
a
cart
and
win
a
race
good
gracious
he
must
be
a
flat
to
think
he
get
a
horse
like
that
since
he
has
so
little
sense
and
such
a
lot
of
cash
to
burn
we
sell
him
some
experience
by
which
alone
a
fool
can
learn
suppose
we
let
him
have
the
trap
to
win
wargeilah
handicap
and
here
i
must
explain
to
you
that
round
about
wargeilah
run
there
lived
a
very
aged
screw
whose
days
of
brilliancy
were
done
a
grand
old
warrior
in
his
prime
but
age
will
beat
us
all
in
time
a
trooper
horse
in
seasons
past
he
did
his
share
to
keep
the
peace
but
took
to
falling
and
at
last
was
cast
for
age
from
the
police
a
publican
at
conroy
gap
then
bought
and
christened
him
the
trap
when
grass
was
good
and
horses
dear
he
changed
his
owner
now
and
then
at
prices
ranging
somewhere
near
the
neighbourhood
of
two
pound
ten
and
manfully
he
earned
his
keep
by
yarding
cows
and
ration
sheep
they
brought
him
in
from
off
the
grass
and
fed
and
groomed
the
old
horse
up
his
coat
began
to
shine
like
glass
you
think
he
win
the
melbourne
cup
and
when
they
got
him
fat
and
flash
they
asked
the
fifty
cash
and
when
he
said
the
price
was
high
their
indignation
knew
no
bounds
they
said
seldom
you
can
buy
a
horse
like
that
for
fifty
pounds
we
refund
twenty
if
the
trap
should
fail
to
win
the
handicap
the
deed
was
done
the
price
was
paid
the
put
the
horse
in
train
the
local
sports
were
much
afraid
that
he
would
sad
experience
gain
by
racing
with
some
shearer
hack
who
beat
him
round
the
track
so
on
this
guileless
english
spark
they
did
most
fervently
impress
that
he
must
keep
the
matter
dark
and
not
let
any
person
guess
that
he
was
purchasing
the
trap
to
win
wargeilah
handicap
they
spoke
of
from
the
bland
and
from
the
castlereagh
and
gave
the
youth
to
understand
that
all
of
these
would
stop
away
and
spoil
the
race
if
they
should
hear
that
they
had
got
the
trap
to
fear
dark
they
muster
thick
as
flies
when
once
the
news
gets
sent
around
we
giving
such
a
splendid
prize
a
snowdon
horse
worth
fifty
pound
they
come
right
in
from
dandaloo
and
find
that
it
a
gift
to
you
the
race
came
on
with
no
display
nor
any
calling
of
the
card
but
round
about
the
pub
all
day
a
crowd
of
shearers
drinking
hard
and
using
language
in
a
strain
flattery
to
call
profane
our
hero
dressed
in
silk
attire
blue
jacket
and
a
scarlet
cap
with
boots
that
shone
like
flames
of
fire
now
did
his
canter
on
the
trap
and
walked
him
up
and
round
about
until
the
other
steeds
came
out
he
eyed
them
with
a
haughty
look
but
saw
a
sight
that
caught
his
breath
it
was
ah
john
the
chinee
cook
in
boots
and
breeches
pale
as
death
tied
with
a
rope
like
any
sack
upon
a
piebald
pony
back
the
next
a
colt
all
mud
and
burrs
with
a
black
boy
up
who
said
pair
o
spurs
i
win
the
bloomin
melbourne
cup
these
two
were
to
oppose
the
trap
for
the
wargeilah
handicap
they
off
the
colt
whipped
down
his
head
and
humped
his
back
and
gave
a
squeal
and
bucked
into
the
drinking
shed
revolving
like
a
wheel
men
ran
like
rats
the
atmosphere
was
filled
with
oaths
and
pints
of
beer
but
up
the
course
the
bold
ah
john
beside
the
trap
raced
neck
and
neck
the
boys
had
tied
him
firmly
on
which
ultimately
proved
his
wreck
the
saddle
turned
and
like
a
clown
he
rode
some
distance
upside
down
his
legs
around
the
horse
were
tied
his
feet
towards
the
heavens
were
spread
he
swung
and
bumped
at
every
stride
and
ploughed
the
ground
up
with
his
head
and
when
they
rescued
him
the
trap
had
won
wargeilah
handicap
and
no
enquiries
we
could
make
could
tell
by
what
false
statements
swayed
ah
john
was
led
to
undertake
a
task
so
foreign
to
his
trade
he
only
smiled
and
said
ki
i
stop
topside
i
win
all
but
never
in
wargeilah
town
was
heard
so
eloquent
a
cheer
as
when
the
president
came
down
and
toasted
in
colonial
beer
finest
rider
on
the
course
the
winner
of
the
snowdon
horse
go
and
get
your
prize
he
said
with
a
wild
mob
somewhere
round
the
mountains
near
the
watershed
he
honestly
worth
fifty
pound
a
noble
horse
indeed
to
win
but
none
of
us
can
run
him
in
chased
him
poor
we
chased
him
fat
we
run
him
till
our
horses
dropped
but
by
such
obstacles
as
that
a
man
like
you
will
not
be
stopped
you
go
and
yard
him
any
day
so
here
your
health
hooray
hooray
the
day
wound
up
with
booze
and
blow
and
fights
till
all
were
well
content
but
of
the
all
i
know
is
shown
by
this
advertisement

other
time
is
simply
bliss
must
be
my
liver
has
gone
amiss
why
i
would
laugh
at
a
sea
like
this
any
other
most
of
us
mean
to
be
better
men
any
other
time
regular
upright
characters
then
any
other
time
yet
somehow
as
the
years
go
by
still
we
gamble
and
drink
and
lie
when
it
comes
to
the
last
we
want
to
die
any
other
time
the
last
trump
led
the
trump
the
old
man
said
with
fury
in
his
eye
yet
you
hope
my
girl
to
wed
young
man
your
hopes
of
love
are
fled
better
she
should
die
sweet
young
daughter
sitting
there
so
innocent
and
plump
you
do
suppose
that
she
would
care
to
wed
an
outlawed
man
who
dare
to
lead
the
thirteenth
trump
you
had
drawn
their
leading
spade
it
meant
a
certain
win
but
no
by
pembroke
mighty
shade
the
thirteenth
trump
you
went
and
played
and
let
their
diamonds
in
girl
return
at
my
command
his
presents
in
a
lump
return
his
ring
for
understand
no
man
is
fit
to
hold
your
hand
who
leads
a
thirteenth
trump
hold
give
every
man
his
due
and
every
dog
his
day
speak
up
and
say
what
made
you
do
this
dreadful
thing
that
is
if
you
have
anything
to
say
he
spoke
meant
at
first
said
he
give
their
spades
a
bump
or
lead
the
hearts
but
then
you
see
i
thought
against
us
there
might
be
perhaps
a
fourteenth
trump
they
buried
him
at
dawn
of
day
beside
a
ruined
stump
and
there
he
sleeps
the
hours
away
and
waits
for
gabriel
to
play
the
last
the
fourteenth
trump
tar
and
feathers
oh
the
circus
swooped
down
on
the
narrabri
town
for
the
narrabri
populace
moneyed
are
and
the
showman
he
smiled
at
the
folk
he
beguiled
to
come
all
the
distance
from
gunnedah
but
a
juvenile
smart
who
objected
to
went
in
the
nod
and
to
do
it
he
crawled
in
through
a
crack
in
the
tent
at
the
back
for
the
boy
had
no
slight
ingenuity
and
says
he
with
a
grin
the
way
to
get
in
but
i
reckon
i
better
be
quiet
or
they
spiflicate
me
and
he
chuckled
for
he
had
the
loan
of
the
circus
proprietor
but
the
showman
astute
on
that
wily
galoot
soon
dropped
and
you
say
that
he
leathered
him
not
he
with
a
grim
sort
of
humorous
whim
he
took
him
and
tarred
him
and
feathered
him
says
he
can
go
round
the
world
with
a
show
and
knock
every
injun
and
arab
wry
with
your
name
and
your
trade
on
the
posters
displayed
the
feathered
from
narrabri
next
day
for
his
freak
by
a
narrabri
beak
he
was
jawed
with
a
deal
of
verbosity
for
his
only
appeal
was
zeal
he
wanted
another
monstrosity
said
his
worship
you
are
fined
forty
bob
and
six
shillin
costs
to
the
clurk
he
says
and
the
narrabri
joy
half
bird
and
half
boy
has
a
on
himself
and
on
circuses
it
grand
it
grand
to
be
a
squatter
and
sit
upon
a
post
and
watch
your
little
ewes
and
lambs
up
the
ghost
it
grand
to
be
a
with
wife
and
kids
to
keep
and
find
an
providence
has
mustered
all
your
sheep
it
grand
to
be
a
western
man
with
shovel
in
your
hand
to
dig
your
little
homestead
out
from
underneath
the
sand
it
grand
to
be
a
shearer
along
the
darling
side
and
pluck
the
wool
from
stinking
sheep
that
some
days
since
have
died
it
grand
to
be
a
rabbit
and
breed
till
all
is
blue
and
then
to
die
in
heaps
because
there
nothing
left
to
chew
it
grand
to
be
a
minister
and
travel
like
a
swell
and
tell
the
central
district
folk
to
go
to
inverell
it
grand
to
be
a
socialist
and
lead
the
bold
array
that
marches
to
prosperity
at
seven
bob
a
day
it
grand
to
be
an
unemployed
and
lie
in
the
domain
and
wake
up
every
second
day
and
go
to
sleep
again
it
grand
to
borrow
english
tin
to
pay
for
wharves
and
rocks
and
then
to
find
it
is
in
the
little
it
grand
to
be
a
democrat
and
toady
to
the
mob
for
fear
that
if
you
told
the
truth
they
hunt
you
from
your
job
it
grand
to
be
a
lot
of
things
in
this
fair
southern
land
but
if
the
lord
would
send
us
rain
that
would
indeed
be
grand
out
of
sight
they
held
a
polo
meeting
at
a
little
country
town
and
all
the
local
sportsmen
came
to
win
themselves
renown
there
came
two
strangers
with
a
horse
and
i
am
much
afraid
they
both
belonged
to
what
is
called
brigade
they
said
their
horse
could
jump
like
fun
and
asked
an
amateur
to
ride
him
in
the
steeplechase
and
told
him
they
were
sure
the
last
time
round
he
sail
away
with
such
a
swallow
flight
the
rest
would
never
see
him
go
he
finish
out
of
sight
so
out
he
went
and
when
folk
saw
the
amateur
was
up
some
local
genius
called
the
race
cup
the
horse
was
known
as
afraid
by
panic
from
fright
but
still
his
owners
told
the
jock
he
finish
out
of
sight
and
so
he
did
for
afraid
without
the
least
pretence
disposed
of
him
by
rushing
through
the
very
second
fence
and
when
they
ran
the
last
time
round
the
prophecy
was
right
for
he
was
in
the
ambulance
and
safely
of
sight
the
road
to
old
man
town
the
fields
of
youth
are
filled
with
flowers
the
wine
of
youth
is
strong
what
need
have
we
to
count
the
hours
the
summer
days
are
long
but
soon
we
find
to
our
dismay
that
we
are
drifting
down
the
barren
slopes
that
fall
away
towards
the
foothills
grim
and
grey
that
lead
to
old
man
town
and
marching
with
us
on
the
track
full
many
friends
we
find
we
see
them
looking
sadly
back
for
those
that
dropped
behind
but
god
forbid
a
fate
so
dread
alone
to
travel
down
the
dreary
road
we
all
must
tread
with
faltering
steps
and
whitening
head
the
road
to
old
man
town
the
old
timer
steeplechase
the
sheep
were
shorn
and
the
wool
went
down
at
the
time
of
our
local
racing
and
i
earned
a
spell
i
was
burnt
and
brown
so
i
rolled
my
swag
for
a
trip
to
town
and
a
look
at
the
steeplechasing
was
rough
and
ready
an
uncleared
course
as
rough
as
the
blacks
had
found
it
with
fences
topped
with
gorse
and
a
that
would
drown
a
horse
and
the
steeple
three
times
round
it
there
was
never
a
fence
the
tracks
to
guard
some
straggling
posts
defined
and
the
day
was
hot
and
the
drinking
hard
till
none
of
the
stewards
could
see
a
yard
before
nor
yet
behind
but
the
bell
was
rung
and
the
nags
were
out
excepting
an
old
outsider
whose
trainer
started
an
awful
rout
for
his
boy
had
gone
on
a
drinking
bout
and
left
him
without
a
rider
there
not
one
man
in
the
crowd
he
cried
the
whole
of
the
crowd
so
clever
is
there
not
one
man
that
will
take
a
ride
on
the
old
white
horse
from
the
northern
side
that
was
bred
on
the
mooki
river
was
an
old
white
horse
that
they
called
the
cow
and
a
cow
would
look
well
beside
him
but
i
was
pluckier
then
than
now
and
i
wanted
excitement
anyhow
so
at
last
i
agreed
to
ride
him
and
the
trainer
said
he
dreadful
slow
and
he
has
a
chance
whatever
but
i
stony
broke
so
it
time
to
show
a
trick
or
two
that
the
trainers
know
who
train
by
the
mooki
river
first
time
round
at
the
further
side
with
the
trees
and
the
scrub
about
you
just
pull
behind
them
and
run
out
wide
and
then
dodge
into
the
scrub
and
hide
and
let
them
go
round
without
you
the
third
time
round
for
the
final
spin
with
the
pace
and
the
dust
to
blind
they
never
notice
if
you
chip
in
for
the
last
you
be
sure
to
win
and
they
think
you
raced
behind
the
you
may
have
to
swim
he
has
a
hope
to
clear
it
unless
he
skims
like
the
swallows
skim
at
full
speed
over
but
not
for
him
he
never
go
next
or
near
it
do
you
worry
just
plunge
across
for
he
swims
like
a
setter
then
hide
away
in
the
scrub
and
gorse
the
rest
will
be
far
ahead
of
course
the
further
ahead
the
better
must
rush
the
jumps
in
the
last
for
fear
that
he
might
refuse
he
try
to
baulk
with
you
i
be
bound
take
whip
and
spurs
on
the
mean
old
hound
and
do
be
afraid
to
use
the
final
round
when
the
field
are
slow
and
you
are
quite
fresh
to
meet
sit
down
and
hustle
him
all
you
know
with
the
whip
and
spurs
and
he
have
to
go
remember
you
got
to
beat
the
flag
went
down
and
we
seemed
to
fly
and
we
made
the
timbers
shiver
of
the
first
big
fence
as
the
stand
flashed
by
and
i
caught
the
ring
of
the
trainer
cry
on
for
the
mooki
river
i
jammed
him
in
with
a
crush
and
recklessly
out
for
slaughter
like
a
living
wave
over
fence
and
brush
we
swept
and
swung
with
a
flying
rush
till
we
came
to
the
dreaded
water
ha
ha
i
laugh
at
it
now
to
think
of
the
way
i
contrived
to
work
it
shut
in
amongst
them
before
you
wink
he
found
himself
on
the
water
brink
with
never
a
chance
to
shirk
it
the
thought
of
the
horror
he
felt
beguiles
the
heart
of
this
grizzled
rover
he
gave
a
snort
you
could
hear
for
miles
and
a
spring
would
have
cleared
the
channel
isles
and
carried
me
safely
over
then
we
neared
the
scrub
and
i
pulled
him
back
in
the
shade
where
the
quiver
and
i
waited
there
in
the
shadows
black
while
the
rest
of
the
horses
round
the
track
went
on
like
a
rushing
river
at
the
second
round
as
the
field
swept
by
i
saw
that
the
pace
was
telling
but
on
they
thundered
and
as
they
passed
the
stand
i
could
hear
the
cry
of
the
folk
in
the
distance
yelling
then
the
last
time
round
and
the
hoofbeats
rang
and
i
said
it
now
or
never
and
out
on
the
heels
of
the
throng
i
sprang
and
the
spurs
bit
deep
and
the
whipcord
sang
as
i
rode
for
the
mooki
river
we
raced
for
home
in
a
cloud
of
dust
and
the
curses
rose
in
chorus
was
flog
and
hustle
and
jump
you
must
and
the
cow
ran
well
but
to
my
disgust
there
was
one
got
home
before
us
was
a
big
black
horse
that
i
had
not
seen
in
the
part
of
the
race
i
ridden
and
his
coat
was
cool
and
his
rider
clean
and
i
thought
that
perhaps
i
had
not
been
the
only
one
that
had
and
the
trainer
came
with
a
visage
blue
with
rage
when
the
race
concluded
said
he
thought
you
have
pulled
us
through
but
the
man
on
the
black
horse
planted
too
and
nearer
to
home
than
you
did
alas
to
think
that
those
times
so
gay
have
vanished
and
passed
for
ever
you
do
believe
in
the
yarn
you
say
why
man
was
a
matter
of
every
day
when
we
raced
on
the
mooki
river
in
the
stable
what
you
do
like
him
well
maybe
we
all
have
our
fancies
of
course
brumby
to
look
at
you
reckon
well
no
he
a
thoroughbred
horse
sired
by
a
son
of
old
panic
look
at
his
ears
and
his
head
and
ai
he
well
that
how
the
panics
are
bred
gluttonous
ugly
and
lazy
rough
as
a
to
ride
yet
if
you
offered
a
sovereign
apiece
for
the
hairs
on
his
hide
that
would
buy
him
nor
twice
that
while
i
a
pound
to
the
good
this
here
old
stager
stays
by
me
and
lives
like
a
thoroughbred
should
hunt
him
away
from
his
bedding
and
sit
yourself
down
by
the
wall
till
you
hear
how
the
old
fellow
saved
me
from
gilbert
and
gilbert
and
hall
and
back
in
the
bushranging
days
made
themselves
kings
of
the
district
ruled
it
in
ways
robbing
the
coach
and
the
escort
stealing
our
horses
at
night
calling
sometimes
at
the
homesteads
and
giving
the
women
a
fright
came
to
the
station
one
morning
and
why
they
did
this
no
one
knows
took
a
brood
mare
from
the
paddock
wanting
some
fun
i
suppose
fastened
a
bucket
beneath
her
hung
by
a
strap
round
her
flank
then
turned
her
loose
in
the
timber
back
of
the
tank
go
she
went
mad
she
went
tearing
and
screaming
with
fear
through
the
trees
while
the
curst
bucket
beneath
her
was
banging
her
flanks
and
her
knees
bucking
and
racing
and
screaming
she
ran
to
the
back
of
the
run
killed
herself
there
in
a
gully
by
god
but
they
paid
for
their
fun
paid
for
it
dear
for
the
found
tracks
and
the
bucket
and
all
and
i
swore
that
i
live
to
get
even
with
gilbert
and
hall
day
after
day
then
i
chased
them
they
had
friends
on
the
sly
friends
who
were
willing
to
sell
them
to
those
who
were
willing
to
buy
early
one
morning
we
found
them
in
camp
at
the
cockatoo
farm
one
of
us
shot
at
and
wounded
him
under
the
arm
ran
them
for
miles
in
the
ranges
till
hall
with
his
horse
fairly
beat
took
to
the
rocks
and
we
lost
him
the
others
made
good
their
retreat
it
was
war
to
the
knife
then
i
tell
you
and
once
on
the
door
of
my
shed
they
nailed
up
a
notice
that
offered
a
hundred
reward
for
my
head
then
we
heard
they
were
gone
from
the
district
they
stuck
up
a
coach
in
the
west
and
i
rode
by
myself
in
the
paddocks
taking
a
bit
of
a
rest
riding
this
colt
as
a
youngster
awkward
and
shy
he
wheeled
round
one
day
on
a
sudden
i
looked
but
i
could
see
why
but
i
soon
found
out
why
for
before
me
the
hillside
rose
up
like
a
wall
and
there
on
the
top
with
their
rifles
were
gilbert
and
hall
was
a
good
run
to
the
homestead
bad
going
with
plenty
of
trees
so
i
gathered
the
youngster
together
and
gripped
at
his
ribs
with
my
knees
was
a
mighty
poor
chance
to
escape
them
it
puts
a
man
nerve
to
the
test
on
a
colt
to
be
hunted
by
the
best
mounted
men
in
the
west
but
the
colt
was
a
racehorse
he
lay
down
to
work
with
a
will
flashed
through
the
scrub
like
a
by
heavens
we
flew
down
the
hill
over
a
gully
he
swept
with
the
spring
of
a
deer
and
they
fired
as
we
jumped
but
they
missed
me
a
bullet
sang
close
to
my
ear
and
the
jump
gained
us
ground
for
they
shirked
it
but
i
saw
as
we
raced
through
the
gap
that
the
rails
at
the
homestead
were
fastened
i
was
caught
like
a
rat
in
a
trap
fenced
with
barbed
wire
was
the
paddock
barbed
wire
that
would
cut
like
a
knife
how
was
a
youngster
to
clear
it
that
never
had
jumped
in
his
life
bang
went
a
rifle
behind
me
the
colt
gave
a
spring
he
was
hit
straight
at
the
sliprails
i
rode
him
i
felt
him
take
hold
of
the
bit
never
a
foot
to
the
right
or
the
left
did
he
swerve
in
his
stride
awkward
and
frightened
but
honest
the
sort
it
a
pleasure
to
ride
straight
at
the
rails
where
they
fastened
barbed
wire
on
the
top
of
the
post
rose
like
a
stag
and
went
over
with
hardly
a
scratch
at
the
most
into
the
homestead
i
darted
and
snatched
down
my
gun
from
the
wall
and
i
tell
you
i
made
them
step
lively
gilbert
and
hall
yes
there
the
mark
of
the
bullet
he
got
it
inside
of
him
yet
mixed
up
somehow
with
his
victuals
but
bless
you
he
do
seem
to
fret
gluttonous
ugly
and
lazy
eats
any
thing
he
can
bite
now
let
us
shut
up
the
stable
and
bid
the
old
fellow
ah
we
ca
breed
the
sort
that
were
bred
when
we
old
were
young
yes
i
was
saying
these
bushrangers
none
of
lived
to
be
hung
gilbert
was
shot
by
the
troopers
hall
was
betrayed
by
his
friend
campbell
disposed
of
bringing
the
lot
to
an
end
but
you
can
talk
about
riding
i
ridden
a
lot
in
the
past
wait
till
there
rifles
behind
you
you
know
what
it
means
to
go
fast
i
steeplechased
raced
and
horses
but
i
think
the
most
dashing
of
all
was
the
ride
when
the
old
fellow
saved
me
from
gilbert
and
hall
he
giveth
his
beloved
sleep
the
long
day
passes
with
its
load
of
sorrow
in
slumber
deep
i
lay
me
down
to
rest
until
thank
god
for
sleep
thank
god
for
all
respite
from
weary
toiling
from
cares
that
creep
across
our
lives
like
evil
shadows
spoiling
god
kindly
sleep
we
plough
and
sow
and
as
the
hours
grow
later
we
strive
to
reap
and
build
our
barns
and
hope
to
build
them
greater
before
we
sleep
we
toil
and
strain
and
strive
with
one
another
in
hopes
to
heap
some
greater
share
of
profit
than
our
brother
before
we
sleep
what
will
it
profit
that
with
tears
or
laughter
our
watch
we
keep
beyond
it
all
there
lies
the
great
hereafter
thank
god
for
sleep
for
at
the
last
beseeching
christ
to
save
us
we
turn
with
deep
thanksgiving
unto
god
who
gave
us
the
gift
of
sleep
driver
smith
was
driver
smith
of
battery
a
was
anxious
to
see
a
fight
he
thought
of
the
transvaal
all
the
day
he
thought
of
it
all
the
night
if
the
battery
left
behind
i
go
to
the
war
says
he
go
an
ambulance
in
the
ranks
of
the
fairly
sick
of
these
here
parades
it
want
of
a
change
that
kills
the
randwick
rifle
range
and
aiming
at
surry
hills
and
i
think
if
i
go
with
the
ambulance
i
certain
to
find
a
show
for
they
have
to
send
the
medical
men
wherever
the
troops
can
go
the
rifle
bullets
flash
and
the
maxims
raise
a
din
it
there
you
find
the
medical
men
the
wounded
in
in
like
human
flies
and
a
driver
smart
like
me
will
find
some
scope
for
his
extra
skill
in
the
ranks
of
the
so
driver
smith
he
went
to
the
war
his
driver
whip
from
ambulance
to
collecting
base
they
showed
him
his
regular
trip
and
he
said
to
the
boys
that
were
marching
past
as
he
gave
his
whip
a
crack
walk
yourselves
to
the
fight
says
he
spare
me
i
drive
you
back
now
the
fight
went
on
in
the
transvaal
hills
for
the
half
of
a
day
or
more
and
driver
smith
he
worked
his
trip
all
aboard
for
the
seat
of
war
he
took
his
load
from
the
stretcher
men
and
hurried
homeward
fast
till
he
heard
a
sound
that
he
knew
full
well
a
battery
rolling
past
he
heard
the
clink
of
the
leading
chains
and
the
roll
of
the
guns
behind
he
heard
the
crack
of
the
drivers
whips
and
he
says
to
me
blind
i
miss
me
trip
with
this
ambulance
although
i
do
care
to
shirk
but
i
take
the
car
off
the
line
and
follow
the
guns
at
work
then
up
the
battery
colonel
came
black
in
the
face
down
and
shift
you
drivers
there
and
gallop
into
place
so
off
the
battery
rolled
and
swung
a
merry
dance
and
holding
his
own
with
the
leading
gun
goes
smith
with
his
ambulance
they
opened
fire
on
the
mountain
side
by
and
large
when
over
the
hill
above
their
flank
the
boers
came
down
at
the
charge
they
rushed
the
guns
with
a
daring
rush
left
and
right
and
driver
smith
with
his
ambulance
moved
up
to
the
edge
of
the
fight
the
gunners
stuck
to
their
guns
like
men
and
fought
like
the
wild
cats
fight
for
a
battery
man
do
leave
his
gun
with
ever
a
hope
in
sight
but
the
bullets
sang
and
the
mausers
cracked
and
the
battery
men
gave
way
till
driver
smith
with
his
ambulance
drove
into
the
thick
of
the
fray
he
saw
the
head
of
the
transvaal
troop
to
and
fro
a
hard
old
face
with
a
monkey
beard
a
face
that
he
seemed
to
know
who
that
leader
said
driver
smith
seen
him
before
why
bless
my
heart
but
it
kruger
self
and
he
jumped
for
him
straight
away
he
collared
old
kruger
round
the
waist
and
hustled
him
into
the
van
it
was
according
to
stretcher
drill
for
raising
a
wounded
man
but
he
forced
him
in
and
said
aboard
we
off
for
a
little
ride
and
you
have
the
car
to
yourself
says
he
reckon
we
full
inside
he
wheeled
his
team
on
the
mountain
side
and
set
a
merry
pace
over
the
rocks
and
stones
and
a
lot
of
the
boers
gave
chase
but
driver
smith
had
a
fairish
start
and
he
said
to
the
boers
you
have
buckley
chance
for
to
catch
a
man
that
was
trained
in
battery
a
he
drove
his
team
to
the
hospital
and
said
to
the
pardon
sir
but
i
missed
a
trip
mistaking
the
way
to
go
and
kruger
came
to
the
ambulance
and
asked
could
we
spare
a
bed
so
i
fetched
him
here
and
we
take
him
home
to
show
for
a
bob
a
head
so
the
word
went
round
to
the
english
troops
to
say
they
need
fight
no
more
for
driver
smith
with
his
ambulance
had
ended
the
blooming
war
and
in
london
now
at
the
music
halls
he
starring
it
every
night
and
drawing
a
hundred
pounds
a
week
to
tell
how
he
won
the
fight
there
another
blessed
horse
fell
down
when
you
lying
in
your
hammock
sleeping
soft
and
sleeping
sound
without
a
care
or
trouble
on
your
mind
and
there
nothing
to
disturb
you
but
the
engines
going
round
and
you
dreaming
of
the
girl
you
left
behind
in
the
middle
of
your
joys
you
be
wakened
by
a
noise
and
a
clatter
on
the
deck
above
your
crown
and
you
hear
the
corporal
shout
as
he
turns
the
picket
out
another
blessed
horse
fell
down
you
can
see
in
the
morning
when
you
cleaning
out
the
stall
on
the
railings
nearly
dead
and
you
reckon
by
the
evening
they
be
pretty
sure
to
fall
and
you
curse
them
as
you
tumble
into
bed
oh
you
hear
it
pretty
soon
the
word
for
denny
moon
there
a
horse
here
throwing
handsprings
like
a
clown
and
it
the
others
back
or
he
cripple
half
the
pack
there
another
blessed
horse
fell
down
and
when
the
war
is
over
and
the
fighting
all
is
done
and
you
all
at
home
with
medals
on
your
chest
and
you
learnt
to
sleep
so
soundly
that
the
firing
of
a
gun
at
your
bedside
would
rob
you
of
your
rest
as
you
lie
in
slumber
deep
if
your
wife
walks
in
her
sleep
and
tumbles
down
the
stairs
and
breaks
her
crown
oh
it
wo
awaken
you
for
you
say
nothing
new
it
another
blessed
horse
fell
down
on
the
trek
oh
the
weary
weary
journey
on
the
trek
day
after
day
with
sun
above
and
silent
veldt
below
and
our
hearts
keep
turning
homeward
to
the
youngsters
far
away
and
the
homestead
where
the
climbing
roses
grow
shall
we
see
the
flats
grow
golden
with
the
ripening
of
the
grain
shall
we
hear
the
parrots
calling
on
the
bough
ah
the
weary
months
of
marching
ere
we
hear
them
call
again
for
we
going
on
a
long
job
now
in
the
drowsy
days
on
escort
riding
slowly
half
asleep
with
the
endless
line
of
waggons
stretching
back
while
the
khaki
soldiers
travel
like
a
mob
of
travelling
sheep
plodding
silent
on
the
track
while
the
constant
snap
and
sniping
of
the
foe
you
never
see
makes
you
wonder
will
your
turn
come
when
and
how
as
the
mauser
ball
hums
past
you
like
a
vicious
kind
of
bee
oh
we
going
on
a
long
job
now
when
the
dash
and
the
excitement
and
the
novelty
are
dead
and
you
seen
a
load
of
wounded
once
or
twice
or
you
watched
your
old
mate
dying
with
the
vultures
overhead
well
you
wonder
if
the
war
is
worth
the
price
and
down
along
monaro
now
they
starting
out
to
shear
i
can
picture
the
excitement
and
the
row
but
they
miss
me
on
the
lachlan
when
they
call
the
roll
this
year
for
we
going
on
a
long
job
now
the
last
parade
with
never
a
sound
of
trumpet
with
never
a
flag
displayed
the
last
of
the
old
campaigners
lined
up
for
the
last
parade
weary
they
were
and
battered
shoeless
and
knocked
about
from
under
their
ragged
forelocks
their
hungry
eyes
looked
out
and
they
watched
as
the
old
commander
read
out
to
the
cheering
men
the
nation
thanks
and
the
orders
to
carry
them
home
again
and
the
last
of
the
old
campaigners
sinewy
lean
and
spare
he
spoke
for
his
hungry
comrades
we
not
done
our
share
and
tired
and
thirsty
we
limped
on
the
blazing
plain
and
after
a
long
night
picket
you
saddled
us
up
again
froze
on
the
kopjes
when
the
frost
lay
never
a
halt
in
the
daytime
never
a
rest
at
night
knew
when
the
rifles
rattled
from
the
hillside
bare
and
brown
and
over
our
weary
shoulders
we
felt
warm
blood
run
down
we
turned
for
the
stretching
gallop
crushed
to
the
earth
with
weight
but
we
carried
our
riders
through
it
carried
them
too
late
we
were
steel
to
stand
it
we
that
have
lasted
through
we
that
are
old
campaigners
pitiful
poor
and
few
the
sea
you
brought
us
over
the
leagues
of
foam
now
we
have
served
you
fairly
will
you
not
take
us
home
to
the
hunter
river
to
the
flats
where
the
lucerne
grows
home
where
the
murrumbidgee
runs
white
with
the
melted
snows
is
a
small
thing
surely
will
not
you
give
command
that
the
last
of
the
old
campaigners
go
back
to
their
native
land
they
looked
at
the
grim
commander
but
never
a
sign
he
made
and
the
old
campaigners
moved
off
from
their
last
parade
with
french
to
kimberley
the
boers
were
down
on
kimberley
with
siege
and
maxim
gun
the
boers
were
down
on
kimberley
their
numbers
ten
to
one
faint
were
the
hopes
the
british
had
to
make
the
struggle
good
defenceless
in
an
open
plain
the
diamond
city
stood
they
built
them
forts
from
bags
of
sand
they
fought
from
roof
and
wall
they
flashed
a
message
to
the
south
or
the
town
must
fall
and
down
our
ranks
the
order
ran
to
march
at
dawn
of
day
for
french
was
off
to
kimberley
to
drive
the
boers
away
he
made
no
march
along
the
line
he
made
no
front
attack
upon
those
magersfontein
heights
that
drove
the
scotchmen
back
but
eastward
over
pathless
plains
by
open
veldt
and
vley
across
the
front
of
cronje
force
his
troopers
held
their
way
the
springbuck
feeding
on
the
flats
where
modder
river
runs
were
startled
by
his
horses
hoofs
the
rumble
of
his
guns
the
dutchman
spies
that
watched
his
march
from
every
rocky
wall
rode
back
in
haste
marches
east
he
threatens
jacobsdal
then
north
he
wheeled
as
wheels
the
hawk
and
showed
to
their
dismay
that
french
was
off
to
kimberley
to
drive
the
boers
away
his
column
was
five
thousand
strong
all
mounted
men
and
guns
there
met
beneath
the
flag
the
empire
sons
they
came
to
prove
to
all
the
earth
that
kinship
conquers
space
and
those
who
fight
the
british
isles
must
fight
the
british
race
from
far
new
zealand
flax
and
fern
from
cold
canadian
snows
from
queensland
plains
where
hot
as
fire
the
summer
sunshine
glows
and
in
the
front
the
lancers
rode
that
new
south
wales
had
sent
with
easy
stride
across
the
plain
their
long
lean
walers
went
unknown
untried
those
squadrons
were
but
proudly
out
they
drew
beside
the
english
regiments
that
fought
at
waterloo
from
every
coast
from
every
clime
they
met
in
proud
array
to
go
with
french
to
kimberley
to
drive
the
boers
away
he
crossed
the
reit
and
fought
his
way
towards
the
modder
bank
the
foemen
closed
behind
his
march
and
hung
upon
the
flank
the
long
dry
grass
was
all
ablaze
and
fierce
the
veldt
fire
runs
he
fought
them
through
a
wall
of
flame
that
blazed
around
the
guns
then
limbered
up
and
drove
at
speed
though
horses
fell
and
died
we
might
not
halt
for
man
nor
beast
on
that
wild
daring
ride
black
with
the
smoke
and
parched
with
thirst
we
pressed
the
livelong
day
our
headlong
march
to
kimberley
to
drive
the
boers
away
we
reached
the
drift
at
fall
of
night
and
camped
across
the
ford
next
day
from
all
the
hills
around
the
dutchman
cannons
roared
a
narrow
pass
between
the
hills
with
guns
on
either
side
the
boldest
man
might
well
turn
pale
before
that
pass
he
tried
for
if
the
first
attack
should
fail
then
every
hope
was
gone
but
french
looked
once
and
only
once
and
then
he
said
on
the
gunners
plied
their
guns
amain
the
hail
of
shrapnel
flew
with
rifle
fire
and
lancer
charge
their
squadrons
back
we
threw
and
through
the
pass
between
the
hills
we
swept
in
furious
fray
and
french
was
through
to
kimberley
to
drive
the
boers
away
ay
french
was
through
to
kimberley
and
ere
the
day
was
done
we
saw
the
diamond
city
stand
lit
by
the
evening
sun
above
the
town
the
heliograph
hung
like
an
eye
of
flame
around
the
town
the
foemen
camped
they
knew
not
that
we
came
but
soon
they
saw
us
rank
on
rank
they
heard
our
squadrons
tread
in
panic
fear
they
left
their
tents
in
hopeless
rout
they
fled
and
french
rode
into
kimberley
the
people
cheered
amain
the
women
came
with
eyes
to
touch
his
bridle
rein
the
starving
children
lined
the
streets
to
raise
a
feeble
cheer
the
bells
rang
out
a
joyous
peal
to
say
is
here
ay
we
that
saw
that
stirring
march
are
proud
that
we
can
say
we
went
with
french
to
kimberley
to
drive
the
boers
away
johnny
boer
men
fight
all
shapes
and
sizes
as
the
racing
horses
run
and
no
man
knows
his
courage
till
he
stands
before
a
gun
at
fighting
hand
to
hand
and
clawing
men
about
they
reckon
is
the
hottest
fighter
out
but
fuzzy
gives
himself
away
his
style
is
out
of
date
he
charges
like
a
driven
grouse
that
rushes
on
its
fate
you
nothing
in
the
world
to
do
but
pump
him
full
of
lead
but
when
you
fighting
johnny
boer
you
have
to
use
your
head
he
do
believe
in
front
attacks
or
charging
at
the
run
he
fights
you
from
a
kopje
with
his
little
maxim
gun
for
when
the
lord
he
made
the
earth
it
seems
uncommon
clear
he
gave
the
job
of
africa
to
some
good
engineer
who
started
building
fortresses
on
fashions
of
his
own
lunettes
redoubts
and
counterscarps
all
made
of
rock
and
stone
the
boer
needs
only
bring
a
gun
for
ready
to
his
hand
he
finds
these
fortresses
all
scattered
through
the
land
and
there
he
sits
and
winks
his
eye
and
wheels
his
gun
about
and
we
must
charge
across
the
plain
to
hunt
the
beggar
out
it
ai
a
game
that
grows
on
us
there
lots
of
better
fun
than
charging
at
old
johnny
with
his
little
maxim
gun
on
rocks
a
goat
could
scarcely
climb
steep
as
the
walls
of
troy
he
wheels
a
about
as
easy
as
a
toy
with
bullocks
yoked
and
manned
he
lifts
her
up
the
rocks
and
shifts
her
every
now
and
then
as
cunning
as
a
fox
at
night
you
mark
her
right
ahead
you
see
her
clean
and
clear
next
day
at
dawn
ho
she
bumps
from
somewhere
in
the
rear
or
else
the
patrol
will
miss
him
with
the
glass
he
lying
hidden
in
the
rocks
to
let
the
leaders
pass
but
when
the
main
guard
comes
along
he
opens
up
the
fun
there
lots
of
ammunition
for
the
little
maxim
gun
but
after
all
the
job
is
sure
although
the
job
is
slow
we
have
to
see
the
business
through
the
boer
has
got
to
go
with
nordenfeldt
and
lyddite
shell
it
certain
soon
or
late
we
hunt
him
from
his
kopjes
and
across
the
orange
state
and
then
across
those
open
flats
you
see
the
beggar
run
and
we
be
running
after
with
our
little
maxim
gun
what
have
the
cavalry
done
what
have
the
cavalry
done
cantered
and
trotted
about
routin
the
enemy
out
causin
the
beggars
to
run
and
we
tramped
along
in
the
blazin
heat
over
the
veldt
on
our
weary
feet
tramp
tramp
tramp
under
the
blazin
sun
with
never
the
sight
of
a
bloomin
boer
they
hunted
long
before
that
what
the
cavalry
done
what
have
the
gunners
done
battlin
every
day
battlin
any
way
boers
outranged
but
what
cared
they
and
be
damned
said
the
see
when
the
fight
grows
hot
under
the
rifles
or
not
always
the
order
runs
up
the
bloomin
guns
and
you
see
them
great
spring
to
the
front
and
around
they
swing
find
the
range
with
some
queer
machine
four
thousand
with
fuse
fourteen
ready
fire
number
one
handled
the
battery
neat
and
quick
stick
to
it
too
how
did
they
stick
never
a
gunner
was
seen
to
run
never
a
gunner
would
leave
his
gun
not
though
his
mates
dropped
all
around
always
a
gunner
would
stand
his
ground
take
the
army
the
infantry
mounted
rifles
and
cavalry
twice
the
numbers
i
give
away
and
i
fight
the
lot
with
the
for
they
showed
us
how
a
corps
should
be
run
that
what
the
gunners
done
right
in
the
front
of
the
army
you
been
this
week
or
more
seen
you
about
the
war
thought
perhaps
you
was
at
the
rear
guarding
the
waggons
us
no
fear
where
have
we
been
why
bless
my
heart
where
have
we
been
since
the
bloomin
start
right
in
the
front
of
the
army
battling
day
and
night
right
in
the
front
of
the
army
teaching
how
to
fight
every
separate
man
you
see
sapper
gunner
and
every
one
of
seems
to
be
right
in
the
front
of
the
army
most
of
the
troops
to
the
camp
had
gone
when
we
met
with
a
toiling
on
and
we
said
to
the
boys
as
they
walked
her
past
thank
goodness
you
here
at
last
at
last
why
what
mean
ai
we
just
where
we
always
been
right
in
the
front
of
the
army
battling
day
and
night
right
in
the
front
of
the
army
teaching
how
to
fight
correspondents
and
vets
in
force
mounted
foot
and
dismounted
horse
all
of
them
were
as
a
matter
of
course
right
in
the
front
of
the
army
old
lord
roberts
will
have
to
mind
if
ever
the
enemy
get
behind
for
they
smash
him
up
with
a
rear
attack
because
his
army
has
got
no
back
think
of
the
horrors
that
might
befall
an
army
without
any
rear
at
all
right
in
the
front
of
the
army
battling
day
and
night
right
in
the
front
of
the
army
teaching
how
to
fight
swede
attaches
and
german
counts
yeomen
known
as
de
wet
remounts
all
of
them
were
by
their
own
accounts
right
in
the
front
of
the
army
that
was
in
the
days
of
front
attack
this
glorious
truth
we
yet
to
learn
it
that
every
had
got
a
back
and
french
was
just
the
man
to
turn
it
a
wounded
soldier
on
the
ground
was
lying
hid
behind
a
hummock
he
proved
the
good
old
proverb
sound
an
army
travels
on
its
stomach
he
lay
as
flat
as
any
fish
his
nose
had
worn
a
little
furrow
he
only
had
one
frantic
wish
that
like
an
antbear
he
could
burrow
the
bullets
whistled
into
space
the
gun
kept
up
its
braying
the
supplied
the
bass
you
think
the
devil
band
was
playing
a
valiant
comrade
crawling
near
observed
his
most
supine
behaviour
and
crept
towards
him
what
cheer
buck
up
said
he
come
to
save
yer
get
up
on
my
shoulders
mate
and
if
we
live
beyond
the
firing
i
get
the
sure
as
fate
because
our
blokes
is
all
retiring
fifty
pounds
a
year
says
he
stand
you
lots
of
beer
and
whisky
says
the
wounded
man
me
i
not
be
saved
it
far
too
risky
fairly
safe
behind
this
mound
i
worn
a
hole
that
seems
to
fit
me
but
if
you
lift
me
off
the
ground
it
fifty
pounds
to
one
they
hit
me
so
back
towards
the
firing
line
our
friend
crept
slowly
to
the
rear
oh
remarking
a
selfish
swine
he
might
have
let
me
be
a
hero
fed
up
i
ai
a
timid
man
at
all
i
just
as
brave
as
most
i
take
my
chance
in
open
fight
and
die
beside
my
post
but
riding
round
the
day
long
as
target
for
a
krupp
fire
from
koppies
well
i
fair
fed
up
it
wonderful
how
few
get
hit
it
luck
that
pulls
us
through
their
rifle
fire
no
class
at
all
it
misses
me
and
you
but
when
they
sprinkle
shells
around
like
water
from
a
cup
from
that
there
blooming
gun
well
i
fed
up
we
never
get
a
chance
to
charge
to
do
a
thrust
and
cut
i
have
to
chuck
the
cavalry
and
join
the
mounted
fut
but
after
all
what
mounted
fut
i
saw
them
day
they
occupied
a
koppie
when
the
boers
had
run
away
the
cavalry
went
riding
on
and
seen
a
score
of
fights
but
there
they
kept
them
mounted
fut
three
solid
days
and
nights
three
solid
starving
days
and
nights
with
scarce
a
bite
or
sup
well
after
that
on
mounted
fut
i
fair
fed
up
and
tramping
with
the
footies
ai
as
easy
as
it
looks
they
scarcely
ever
see
a
boer
except
in
picture
books
they
do
a
march
of
twenty
mile
that
leaves
nearly
dead
and
then
they
find
the
bloomin
boers
is
twenty
miles
ahead
each
footy
is
as
full
of
fight
as
any
bulldog
pup
but
walking
forty
miles
to
fight
well
i
fed
up
so
after
all
i
think
that
when
i
leave
the
cavalry
i
either
join
the
ambulance
or
else
the
they
always
tucker
in
the
plate
and
coffee
in
the
cup
but
bully
beef
and
biscuits
well
i
fair
fed
up
jock
there
a
soldier
that
been
doing
of
his
share
in
the
fighting
up
and
down
and
round
about
he
continually
marching
here
and
there
and
he
fighting
morning
in
and
morning
out
the
boer
you
see
he
generally
runs
but
sometimes
when
he
hides
behind
a
rock
and
we
ca
make
no
impression
with
the
guns
oh
then
you
hear
the
order
for
jock
yes
it
jock
scotch
jock
he
the
fellow
that
can
give
or
take
a
knock
for
he
hairy
and
he
hard
and
his
feet
are
by
the
yard
and
his
face
is
like
the
face
what
on
a
clock
but
when
the
bullets
fly
you
will
mostly
hear
the
cry
for
jock
the
cavalry
have
gun
and
sword
and
lance
before
they
choose
their
weapon
why
they
dead
the
mounted
fut
are
hampered
in
advance
by
holding
of
their
helmets
on
their
head
and
when
the
boer
has
dug
himself
a
trench
and
placed
his
maxim
gun
behind
a
rock
these
mounted
heroes
pets
of
johnny
french
they
have
to
sit
and
wait
and
send
for
jock
yes
the
jocks
scotch
jocks
with
their
music
that
terrify
an
ox
when
the
bullets
kick
the
sand
you
can
hear
the
sharp
command
at
the
double
charge
the
rocks
and
the
charge
is
like
a
flood
when
they
warmed
the
highland
blood
of
the
jocks
santa
claus
halt
who
goes
there
the
sentry
call
rose
on
the
midnight
air
above
the
noises
of
the
camp
the
roll
of
wheels
the
horses
tramp
the
challenge
echoed
over
all
halt
who
goes
there
a
quaint
old
figure
clothed
in
white
he
bore
a
staff
of
pine
an
was
on
his
head
oh

the
sentry
said

i
roam

whole

over

to
exiles
all
at

from
those
who
love

tenderly
i
bring
a
thought
of

from

from
those
far
lands
ye
hold
most
dear
i
bring
you

i

blessings
on

wish
you
well
the
sentry
said
but
here
alas
you
may
not
pass
without
the
countersign
he
vanished
and
the
sentry
tramp
down
the
line
it
was
not
till
the
morning
light
the
soldiers
knew
that
in
the
night
old
santa
claus
had
come
to
camp
without
the
countersign
from
a
section
of
advertisements
the
man
from
snowy
river
and
other
verses
by
a
paterson
the
immediate
success
of
this
book
of
bush
ballads
is
without
parallel
in
colonial
literary
annals
nor
can
any
living
english
or
american
poet
boast
so
wide
a
public
always
excepting
rudyard
kipling
these
lines
have
the
true
lyrical
cry
in
them
eloquent
and
ardent
verses
swinging
rattling
ballads
of
ready
humour
ready
pathos
and
crowding
stirring
and
entertaining
ballads
about
great
rides
in
which
the
lines
gallop
like
the
very
hoofs
of
the
horses
at
his
best
he
compares
not
unfavourably
with
the
author
of
ballads
patchett
martin
london
in
my
opinion
it
is
the
absolutely
thoroughly
australian
style
and
character
of
these
new
bush
bards
which
has
given
them
such
immediate
popularity
such
wide
vogue
among
all
classes
of
the
rising
native
generation
australia
has
produced
in
a
paterson
a
national
poet
whose
bush
ballads
are
as
distinctively
characteristic
of
the
country
as
burns
poetry
is
characteristic
of
scotland
a
book
like
this
is
worth
a
dozen
of
the
aspiring
idealistic
sort
since
it
has
a
deal
of
rough
laughter
and
a
dash
of
real
tears
in
its
composition
these
ballads
are
full
of
such
go
that
the
mere
reading
of
them
make
the
blood
but
there
are
other
things
in
paterson
book
besides
mere
racing
and
chasing
and
each
piece
bears
the
mark
of
special
local
knowledge
feeling
and
colour
the
poet
has
also
a
note
of
pathos
which
is
always
wholesome
he
gallops
along
with
a
by
no
means
doubtful
music
shouting
his
vigorous
songs
as
he
rides
in
pursuit
of
wild
bush
horses
constraining
us
to
listen
and
applaud
by
dint
of
his
manly
tones
and
capital
subjects
we
turn
to
paterson
roaring
muse
with
instantaneous
gratitude
rio
grande
last
race
and
other
verses
by
a
paterson
there
is
no
mistaking
the
vigour
of
paterson
verse
there
is
no
difficulty
in
feeling
the
strong
human
interest
which
moves
in
it
every
way
worthy
of
the
man
who
ranks
with
the
first
of
australian
poets
at
once
naturalistic
and
imaginative
and
racy
without
being
slangy
the
poems
have
always
a
strong
human
interest
of
life
to
keep
them
going
they
make
a
book
which
should
give
an
equal
pleasure
to
simple
and
to
fastidious
readers
now
and
again
a
deeper
theme
like
an
echo
from
the
older
more
experienced
land
leads
him
to
more
serious
singing
and
proves
that
real
poetry
is
after
all
universal
it
is
a
hearty
book
paterson
has
powerful
and
varied
sympathies
coupled
with
a
genuine
lyrical
impulse
and
some
skill
which
makes
his
attempts
always
attractive
and
usually
successful
these
are
all
entertaining
their
rough
and
ready
wit
and
virility
of
expression
making
them
highly
acceptable
while
the
dash
of
satire
gives
point
to
the
humour
he
catches
the
bush
in
its
most
joyous
moments
and
writes
of
it
with
the
simple
charm
of
an
unaffected
lover
will
be
welcome
to
that
too
select
class
at
home
who
follow
the
australian
endeavour
to
utter
a
fresh
and
genuine
poetic
voice
paterson
now
proves
beyond
question
that
australia
has
produced
at
least
one
singer
who
can
voice
in
truest
poetry
the
aspirations
and
experiences
peculiar
to
the
commonwealth
and
who
is
to
be
ranked
with
the
foremost
living
poets
of
the
motherland
fine
swinging
stirring
stuff
that
sings
as
it
goes
along
the
subjects
are
capital
and
some
of
the
refrains
haunt
one
there
is
always
room
for
a
book
of
unpretentious
vigorous
verse
of
this
sort
these
ballads
make
bright
and
easy
reading
one

note
andrew
barton
paterson
was
born
at
narambla
in
new
south
wales
on
february
but
grew
up
at
buckenbah
and
illalong
he
became
a
lawyer
but
devoted
much
of
his
time
to
writing
and
gained
popularity
especially
for
his
poetry
and
ballads
his
best
known
poems
are
the
man
from
snowy
river
on
which
a
motion
picture
was
loosely
based
and
waltzing
matilda
which
slowly
became
an
australian
symbol
and
national
song
the
poems
he
wrote
for
a
sydney
newspaper
led
him
into
reporting
and
he
went
to
south
africa
to
cover
the
boer
war
always
a
fair
man
he
had
his
doubts
about
the
war
and
was
a
little
too
vocal
about
it
for
the
tastes
of
some
of
his
readers
during
the
first
world
war
he
served
in
egypt
as
a
major
in
a
remount
unit
training
horses
for
the
war
this
fit
one
of
his
main
interests
in
life
horses
a
preoccupation
which
is
very
evident
in
his
poems
and
even
in
his
choice
of
pseudonym
the
banjo
was
a
the
works
for
which
paterson
is
famous
were
mostly
written
before
the
first
world
war
and
are
collected
in
three
books
of
poems
the
man
from
snowy
river
and
other
verses
rio
grande
last
race
and
other
verses
and
saltbush
bill
and
other
verses
his
prose
works
include
an
outback
marriage
and
three
elephant
power
and
other
stories
the
latter
of
which
is
a
collection
of
tall
tales
and
serious
but
often
humourous
reporting
in
fact
above
all
else
it
is
perhaps
paterson
sense
of
humour
that
sets
him
apart
from
such
balladists
as
rudyard
kipling
and
robert
service
it
should
also
be
noted
that
paterson
was
writing
his
ballads
before
either
of
these
became
and
there
was
little
if
any
influence
from
either
side
more
likely
paterson
was
influenced
by
the
scottish
tradition
of
poetry
paterson
was
of
scottish
descent
which
had
been
popularized
in
australia
by
adam
lindsay
gordon
and
others
