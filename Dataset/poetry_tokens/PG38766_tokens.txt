the
lines
in
this
little
book
as
in
all
my
others
were
written
or
at
least
conceived
in
the
lands
where
the
scenes
are
laid
so
that
whatever
may
be
said
of
the
imperfections
of
my
work
i
at
least
have
the
correct
atmosphere
and
color
i
have
now
and
then
sent
forth
from
mexico
and
from
remoter
shores
of
the
gulf
fragments
of
these
thoughts
as
they
rounded
into
form
and
some
of
them
have
been
used
at
a
dartmouth
college
commencement
and
elsewhere
but
as
a
whole
the
book
is
new
from
the
heart
of
the
sierra
where
i
once
more
hear
the
awful
of
nature
i
now
intrust
the
first
reception
of
these
lessons
entirely
to
my
own
country
and
may
i
not
ask
in
return
now
at
the
last
when
the
shadows
begin
to
grow
long
something
of
that
consideration
which
thus
far
has
been
accorded
almost
entirely

songs
of
the
mexican
seas
the
sea
of
fire
in
that
far
land
farther
than
yucatan
hondurian
height
or
mahogany
steep
where
the
great
sea
hollowed
by
the
hand
of
man
hears
deep
come
calling
across
to
deep
where
the
great
seas
follow
in
the
grooves
of
men
down
under
the
bastions
of
darien
in
that
land
so
far
that
you
wonder
whether
if
god
would
know
it
should
you
fall
down
dead
in
that
land
so
far
through
the
wilds
and
weather
that
the
lost
sun
sinks
like
a
warrior
sped
where
the
sea
and
the
sky
seem
closing
together
seem
closing
together
as
a
book
that
is
read
in
that
nude
warm
world
where
the
unnamed
rivers
roll
restless
in
cradles
of
bright
buried
gold
where
white
flashing
mountains
flow
rivers
of
silver
as
a
rock
of
the
desert
flowed
fountains
of
old
by
a
dark
wooded
river
that
calls
to
the
dawn
and
calls
all
day
with
his
dolorous
swan
in
that
land
of
the
wonderful
sun
and
weather
with
green
under
foot
and
with
gold
over
head
where
the
spent
sun
flames
and
you
wonder
whether
is
an
isle
of
fire
in
his
foamy
bed
where
the
oceans
of
earth
shall
be
welded
together
by
the
great
french
master
in
his
forge
flame
red
lo
the
world
yon
footfall
retreating
it
might
be
the
maker
disturbed
at
his
task
but
the
footfall
of
god
or
the
far
pheasant
beating
it
is
one
and
the
same
whatever
the
mask
it
may
wear
unto
man
the
woods
keep
repeating
the
old
sacred
sermons
whatever
you
ask
the
cattle
come
stealthy
to
drink
the
wild
forest
cattle
with
high
horns
as
trim
as
the
elk
at
their
side
their
sleek
necks
are
slim
and
alert
like
the
deer
they
come
then
they
shrink
as
afraid
of
their
fellows
of
seen
in
the
deeps
of
the
waters
of
green
it
is
man
in
his
garden
scarce
wakened
as
yet
from
the
sleep
that
fell
on
him
when
woman
was
made
the
garden
is
plastic
and
wet
from
the
hand
that
has
fashioned
its
unpeopled
shade
and
the
wonder
still
looks
from
the
fair
woman
eyes
as
she
shines
through
the
wood
like
the
light
from
the
skies
and
a
ship
now
and
then
from
some
far
ophir
shore
draws
in
from
the
sea
it
lies
close
to
the
bank
then
a
dull
muffled
sound
of
the
plank
as
they
load
the
black
ship
but
you
hear
nothing
more
and
the
dark
dewy
vines
and
the
tall
sombre
wood
like
twilight
droop
over
the
deep
sweeping
flood
the
black
masts
are
tangled
with
branches
that
cross
the
rich
fragrant
gums
fall
from
branches
to
deck
the
thin
ropes
are
swinging
with
streamers
of
moss
that
mantle
all
things
like
the
shreds
of
a
wreck
the
long
mosses
swing
there
is
never
a
breath
the
river
rolls
still
as
the
river
of
death
i
in
the
beginning
ay
before
the
labors
were
well
yea
while
the
world
lay
incomplete
ere
god
had
opened
quite
the
door
of
this
strange
land
for
strong
men
feet
there
lay
against
that
westmost
sea
one
land
of
mystery
a
far
white
wall
like
fallen
moon
girt
out
the
world
the
forest
lay
so
deep
you
scarcely
saw
the
day
save
in
the
middle
noon
it
lay
a
land
of
sleep
and
dreams
and
clouds
drew
through
like
shoreless
streams
that
stretch
to
where
no
man
may
say
men
reached
it
only
from
the
sea
by
ships
that
seemed
to
creep
along
the
shore
suspiciously
like
unnamed
monsters
of
the
deep
it
was
the
weirdest
land
i
ween
that
mortal
eye
has
ever
seen
a
dim
dark
land
of
bird
and
beast
black
shaggy
beasts
with
cloven
claw
a
land
that
scarce
knew
prayer
or
priest
or
law
of
man
or
nature
law
where
no
fixed
line
drew
sharp
dispute
savage
man
and
silent
brute
ii
it
hath
a
history
most
fit
for
cunning
hand
to
fashion
on
no
chronicler
hath
mentioned
it
no
buccaneer
set
foot
upon
is
of
an
outlawed
spanish
don
a
cruel
man
with
pirate
gold
that
loaded
down
his
deep
ship
hold
a
deep
ship
hold
of
plundered
gold
the
golden
cruise
the
golden
cross
from
many
a
church
of
mexico
from
panama
mad
overthrow
from
many
a
ransomed
city
loss
from
many
a
follower
stanch
and
bold
and
many
a
foeman
stark
and
cold
he
found
this
wild
lost
land
he
drew
his
ship
to
shore
his
ruthless
crew
like
romulus
laid
lawless
hand
on
meek
brown
maidens
of
the
land
and
in
their
bloody
forays
bore
red
firebrands
along
the
shore
iii
the
red
men
rose
at
night
they
came
a
firm
unflinching
wall
of
flame
they
swept
as
sweeps
some
fateful
sea
land
of
sand
and
level
shore
that
howls
in
far
fierce
agony
the
red
men
swept
that
deep
dark
shore
as
threshers
sweep
a
and
yet
beside
the
slain
don
door
they
left
his
daughter
as
they
fled
they
spared
her
life
because
she
bore
their
chieftain
blood
and
name
the
red
and
hidden
hoards
of
gold
they
hollowed
from
the
stout
ship
hold
and
bore
in
many
a
slim
canoe
to
where
the
good
priest
only
knew
iv
the
course
of
life
is
like
the
sea
men
come
and
go
tides
rise
and
fall
and
that
is
all
of
history
the
tide
flows
in
flows
out
and
that
is
all
that
man
may
say
man
is
man
was
and
that
is
all
revenge
at
last
came
like
a
tide
was
sweeping
deep
and
terrible
the
christian
found
the
land
and
came
to
take
possession
in
christ
name
for
every
white
man
that
had
died
i
think
a
thousand
red
men
fell
a
christian
custom
and
the
land
lay
lifeless
as
some
brand
ere
while
the
slain
don
daughter
grew
a
glorious
thing
a
flower
of
spring
a
lithe
slim
reed
a
weed
a
something
more
than
mortal
knew
a
mystery
of
grace
and
face
a
silent
mystery
that
stood
an
empress
in
that
wood
supreme
imperial
in
her
place
it
might
have
been
men
lust
for
gold
for
all
men
knew
that
lawless
crew
left
hoards
of
gold
in
that
ship
hold
that
drew
ships
hence
and
silent
drew
strange
jasons
to
that
steep
wood
shore
as
if
to
seek
that
hidden
store
i
never
either
cared
or
knew
i
say
it
might
have
been
this
gold
that
ever
drew
and
strangely
drew
strong
men
of
land
strange
men
of
sea
to
seek
this
shore
of
mystery
with
all
its
wondrous
tales
untold
the
gold
or
her
which
of
the
two
it
matters
not
i
never
knew
but
this
i
know
that
as
for
me
between
that
face
and
the
hard
fate
that
kept
me
ever
from
my
own
as
some
wronged
monarch
from
his
throne
god
gold
of
land
or
sea
had
never
weighed
one
feather
weight
her
home
was
on
the
wooded
height
a
woody
home
a
priest
at
prayer
a
perfume
in
the
fervid
air
and
angels
watching
her
at
night
i
can
but
think
upon
the
skies
that
bound
that
other
paradise
vi
below
a
arch
as
grand
as
ever
bended
heaven
spanned
tall
trees
like
mighty
columns
grew
they
loomed
as
if
to
pierce
the
blue
they
reached
as
reaching
heaven
through
the
shadowed
stream
rolled
far
below
where
men
moved
noiseless
to
and
fro
as
in
some
vast
cathedral
when
the
calm
of
prayer
comes
to
men
with
benedictions
bending
low
lo
wooded
wild
and
steep
a
trackless
wood
a
snowy
cone
that
lifted
from
this
wood
alone
this
wild
wide
river
dark
and
deep
a
ship
against
the
shore
asleep

an
indian
woman

a
crone
hard
by
about
the
land
alone
the
relic
of
her
perished
race
she
wore
rich
bands
of
gold
above
her
bony
hands
she
hissed
hot
curses
on
the
place

a
lonesome
land
the
haunted
lands
red
mouths
of
beasts
red
men
red
hands
red
in
mute
defeat
his
boundaries
in

this
same
wrapped
stands
all
nude
and
voiceless
nearer
to
the
awful
god
than
i
or
you
ix
this
bronzed
child
by
that
river
brink
stood
fair
to
see
as
you
can
think
as
tall
as
tall
reeds
at
her
feet
as
fresh
as
flowers
in
her
hair
as
sweet
as
flowers
as
fair
as
vision
more
than
fair
how
beautiful
she
was
how
wild
how
pure
as
this
child
this
one
wild
child
of
nature
here
grown
tall
in
shadows
and
how
near
to
god
where
no
man
stood
between
her
eyes
and
scenes
no
man
hath
seen
this
maiden
that
so
mutely
stood
the
one
lone
woman
of
that
wood
stop
still
my
friend
and
do
not
stir
shut
close
your
page
and
think
of
her
the
birds
sang
sweeter
for
her
face
her
lifted
eyes
were
like
a
grace
to
seamen
of
that
solitude
however
rough
however
rude
the
rippled
rivers
of
her
hair
that
ran
in
wondrous
waves
somehow
flowed
down
divided
by
her
brow
half
mantled
her
within
its
care
and
flooded
all
or
bronze
or
snow
in
its
uncommon
fold
and
flow
a
perfume
and
an
incense
lay
before
her
as
an
incense
sweet
before
blithe
mowers
of
sweet
may
in
early
morn
her
certain
feet
embarked
on
no
uncertain
way
come
think
how
perfect
before
men
how
sweet
as
sweet
magnolia
bloom
embalmed
in
dews
of
morning
when
rich
sunlight
leaps
from
midnight
gloom
resolved
to
kiss
and
swift
to
kiss
ere
yet
morn
wakens
man
to
bliss
x
the
days
swept
on
her
perfect
year
was
with
her
now
the
sweet
perfume
of
womanhood
in
holy
bloom
as
when
red
harvest
blooms
appear
possessed
her
now
the
priest
did
pray
that
saints
alone
should
pass
that
way
a
red
bird
built
beneath
her
roof
brown
squirrels
crossed
her
cabin
sill
and
welcome
came
or
went
at
will
a
hermit
spider
wove
his
web
and
up
against
the
roof
would
spin
his
net
to
catch
mosquitoes
in
the
silly
elk
the
spotted
fawn
and
all
dumb
beasts
that
came
to
drink
that
stealthy
stole
upon
the
brink
in
that
dim
while
that
lies
between
the
coming
night
and
going
dawn
on
seeing
her
familiar
face
would
fearless
stop
and
stand
in
place
she
was
so
kind
the
beasts
of
night
gave
her
the
road
as
if
her
right
the
panther
crouching
overhead
in
sheen
of
moss
would
hear
her
tread
and
bend
his
eyes
but
never
stir
lest
he
by
chance
might
frighten
her
yet
in
her
splendid
strength
her
eyes
there
lay
the
lightning
of
the
skies
the
of
the
lioness
to
kill
the
instant
or
caress
a
soul
that
sometimes
grew
impatient
why
she
hardly
knew
at
last
she
sighed
uprose
and
threw
her
strong
arms
out
as
if
to
hand
her
love
and
all
complete
at
birth
to
some
brave
lover
feet
on
some
far
fair
and
unseen
land
as
knowing
now
not
what
to
do
xi
how
beautiful
she
was
why
she
was
inspiration
she
was
born
to
walk
god
summer
hills
at
morn
nor
waste
her
by
this
sea
what
wonder
then
her
soul
white
wings
beat
at
its
bars
like
living
things
once
more
she
sighed
she
wandered
through
the
wood
then
stopped
and
drew
her
hand
above
her
face
and
swept
the
lonesome
sea
and
all
day
kept
her
face
to
sea
as
if
she
knew
some
day
some
near
or
distant
day
her
destiny
should
come
that
way
xii
how
proud
she
was
how
darkly
fair
how
full
of
faith
of
love
of
strength
her
calm
proud
eyes
her
great
hair
length
her
long
strong
tumbled
careless
hair
half
curled
and
knotted
anywhere
from
brow
to
breast
from
cheek
to
chin
for
love
to
trip
and
tangle
in
xiii
at
last
a
tall
strange
sail
was
seen
it
came
so
slow
so
wearily
came
creeping
cautious
up
the
sea
as
if
it
crept
from
out
between
the
sea
and
sky
that
lay
tight
wedged
together
far
away
she
watched
it
wooed
it
she
did
pray
it
might
not
pass
her
by
but
bring
some
love
some
hate
some
anything
to
break
the
awful
loneliness
that
like
a
nightly
nightmare
lay
upon
her
proud
and
soul
until
it
barely
brooked
control
xiv
the
ship
crept
silent
up
the
sea
and
came
you
can
not
understand
how
fair
she
was
how
sudden
she
had
sprung
to
womanhood
how
gracious
yet
how
proud
and
grand
how
glorified
yet
fresh
and
free
how
human
yet
how
more
than
good
xv
the
ship
stole
slowly
slowly
on
should
you
in
californian
field
in
ample
behold
the
soft
south
rose
lift
like
a
shield
against
the
sudden
sun
at
dawn
a
double
handful
of
heaped
gold
why
you
perhaps
might
understand
how
splendid
and
how
queenly
she
uprose
beside
that
sea
the
ship
scarce
seemed
to
creep
from
wave
to
wave
it
scarce
could
keep
how
still
this
fair
girl
stood
how
fair
how
proud
her
presence
as
she
stood
between
that
vast
sea
and
west
wood
how
large
and
liberal
her
soul
how
confident
how
purely
chare
how
trusting
how
untried
the
whole
great
heart
grand
faith
that
blossomed
there
xvi
ay
she
was
as
madonna
to
the
tawny
lawless
faithful
few
who
touched
her
hand
and
knew
her
soul
she
drew
them
drew
them
as
the
pole
points
all
things
to
itself
she
drew
men
upward
as
a
moon
of
spring
high
wheeling
vast
and
half
clad
in
clouds
and
white
as
wool
draws
all
the
strong
seas
following
yet
still
she
moved
as
sad
as
lone
as
that
same
moon
that
leans
above
and
seems
to
search
high
heaven
through
for
some
strong
love
for
one
brave
love
to
be
her
own
to
lean
upon
to
love
to
woo
to
lord
her
high
white
world
to
yield
his
clashing
sword
against
her
shield
oh
i
once
knew
a
sad
white
dove
that
died
for
such
sufficient
love
such
soul
with
wings
to
soar
that
stood
up
equal
in
its
place
that
looked
love
level
in
the
face
nor
wearied
love
with
leaning
to
lift
love
level
where
she
trod
in
sad
delight
the
hills
of
god
xvii
how
slow
before
the
sleeping
breeze
that
stranger
ship
from
under
seas
how
like
to
dido
by
her
sea
when
reaching
arms
imploringly
her
large
round
rich
impassioned
arms
tossed
forth
from
all
her
storied
charms
this
one
lone
maiden
leaning
stood
above
that
sea
beside
the
wood
the
ship
crept
strangely
up
the
seas
her
shrouds
seemed
shreds
her
masts
seemed
trees
strange
tattered
trees
of
toughest
bough
that
knew
no
cease
of
storm
till
now
the
maiden
pitied
her
she
prayed
her
crew
might
come
nor
feel
afraid
she
prayed
the
winds
might
come
they
came
as
birds
that
answer
to
a
name
the
maiden
held
her
blowing
hair
that
bound
her
beauteous
self
about
the
housed
within
her
hair
she
let
it
go
it
blew
in
rout
about
her
bosom
full
and
bare
her
round
full
arms
were
free
as
air
her
high
hands
clasped
as
clasped
in
prayer
xviii
the
breeze
grew
bold
the
battered
ship
began
to
flap
her
weary
wings
the
tall
torn
masts
began
to
dip
and
walk
the
wave
like
living
things
she
rounded
in
she
struck
the
stream
she
moved
like
some
majestic
dream
the
captain
kept
her
deck
he
stood
a
hercules
among
his
men
and
now
he
watched
the
sea
and
then
he
peered
as
if
to
pierce
the
wood
he
now
looked
back
as
if
pursued
now
swept
the
sea
with
glass
as
though
he
fled
or
feared
some
hidden
foe
swift
sailing
up
the
river
mouth
swift
tacking
north
swift
tacking
south
he
touched
the
overhanging
wood
he
tacked
his
ship
his
tall
black
mast
touched
mosses
as
he
passed
he
touched
the
steep
shore
where
she
stood
xix
her
hands
still
clasped
as
if
in
prayer
sweet
prayer
set
to
silentness
her
throat
uplifted
bare
and
beautiful
her
eager
face
illumed
with
love
and
tenderness
and
all
her
presence
gave
such
grace
dark
shadowed
in
her
cloud
of
hair
that
she
seemed
more
than
mortal
fair
xx
he
saw
he
could
not
speak
no
more
with
lifted
glass
he
sought
the
sea
no
more
he
watched
the
wild
new
shore
now
foes
might
come
now
friends
might
flee
he
could
not
speak
he
would
not
stir
he
saw
but
her
he
feared
but
her
the
black
ship
ground
against
the
shore
she
ground
against
the
bank
as
one
with
long
and
weary
journeys
done
that
would
not
rise
to
journey
more
yet
still
this
jason
silent
stood
and
gazed
against
that
wood
as
one
whose
soul
is
anywhere
all
seemed
so
fair
so
wondrous
fair
at
last
aroused
he
stepped
to
land
like
some
columbus
they
laid
hand
on
lands
and
fruits
and
rested
there
xxi
he
found
all
fairer
than
fair
morn
in
sylvan
land
where
waters
run
with
downward
leap
against
the
sun
and
sudden
may
is
born
he
found
her
taller
than
tall
corn
tiptoe
in
tassel
found
her
sweet
as
vale
where
bees
of
hybla
meet
an
unblown
rose
an
unread
book
a
wonder
in
her
wondrous
eyes
a
large
religious
steadfast
look
of
faith
of
trust
the
look
of
one
new
welcomed
in
her
paradise
he
read
this
book
read
on
and
on
from
titlepage
to
colophon
as
in
cool
woods
some
summer
day
you
find
delight
in
some
sweet
lay

so
entranced
read
on

on
from

who
was

there
this

huge
so

this

this

the

i
do

you

they
loved
this
maiden

this
man

that
is
all
i
surely
know
the
rest
is
as
the

that
blow
he
bowed
as
brave
men
bow
to
fate
yet
proud
and
resolute
and
bold
she
coy
at
first
and
mute
and
cold
held
back
and
seemed
to
hesitate
half
frightened
at
this
love
that
ran
hard
gallop
till
her
hot
heart
beat
like
sounding
of
swift
courser
feet
xxiii
two
strong
streams

love

it

us
then
love

the

stop
the

pointing

xxiv
how
piteous
strange
is
love
the
walks
by
wooded
ways
the
silent
talks
beneath
the
broad
and
fragrant
bough
the
dark
deep
wood
the
dense
black
dell
where
scarce
a
single
gold
beam
fell
from
out
the
sun
they
rested
now
on
mossy
trunk
they
wandered
then
where
never
fell
the
feet
of
men
then
longer
walks
then
deeper
woods
then
sweeter
talks
sufficient
sweet
in
denser
deeper
solitudes
dear
careless
ways
for
careless
feet
sweet
talks
of
paradise
for
two
and
only
two
to
watch
or
woo
she
rarely
spake
all
seemed
a
dream
she
would
not
waken
from
she
lay
all
night
but
waiting
for
the
day
when
she
might
see
his
face
and
deem
this
man
with
all
his
perils
passed
had
found
the
at
last
xxv
the
year
waxed
fervid
and
the
sun
fell
central
down
the
forest
lay
in
the
heat
the
sea
below
the
steep
bank
seemed
to
run
a
molten
sea
of
gold
away
against
the
gray
and
isles
that
broke
the
molten
watery
miles
where
lonesome
called
all
day
the
sudden
sun
smote
angrily
therefore
the
need
of
deeper
deeps
of
denser
shade
for
man
and
maid
of
higher
heights
of
cooler
steeps
where
all
day
long
the
stayed
they
sought
the
steep
the
breeze
swept
twenty
thousand
miles
of
seas
had
twenty
thousand
things
to
say
of
love
of
lovers
of
cathay
to
lovers
these
trees
xxvi
to

to

below
the
height
below
the
wood
by
wave
and
stream
plumed
pampas
grasses
grew
to
gleam
and
bend
their
lordly
plumes
and
run
and
shake
as
if
in
very
fright
before
sharp
lances
of
the
sun
they
saw
the
battered
ship
creep
close
below
against
the
bank
they
saw
it
cringe
and
shrink
it
shrank
as
shrinks
some
huge
black
beast
with
fear
when
some
uncommon
dread
is
near
they
heard
the
melting
resin
drip
as
drip
the
last
brave
when
life
battle
waxes
hot
with
men
xxvii
yet
what
to
her
were
burning
seas
or
what
to
him
was
forest
flame
they
loved
they
loved
the
glorious
trees
the
gleaming
tides
or
rise
or
fall
they
loved
the
lisping
winds
that
came
from
isles
unknown
with
breath
not
warmer
than
their
own
they
loved
they
loved
and
that
was
all
xxviii
full
noon
below
the
ancient
moss
with
mighty
boughs
high
clanged
across
the
man
with
sweet
words
fell
pleading
plaintive
at
her
feet
he
spake
of
love
of
boundless
love
of
love
that
knew
no
other
land
or
face
or
place
or
anything
of
love
that
like
the
wearied
dove
could
light
nowhere
but
kept
the
wing
till
she
alone
put
forth
her
hand
and
so
received
it
in
her
ark
from
seas
that
shake
against
the
dark
he
clasped
her
hands
climbed
past
her
knees
forgot
her
hands
and
kissed
her
hair
the
while
her
two
hands
clasped
in
prayer
and
fair
face
lifted
to
the
trees
her
proud
breast
heaved
her
pure
proud
breast
rose
like
the
waves
in
their
unrest
when
counter
storms
possess
the
seas
her
mouth
her
arched
uplifted
mouth
her
ardent
mouth
that
thirsted
so
no
glowing
of
the
south
can
say
no
man
can
say
or
know
the
glory
there
and
so
live
on
content
without
that
glory
gone
her
face
still
lifted
up
and
she
disdained
the
cup
of
passion
he
hard
pressed
her
panting
lips
to
touch
she
dashed
it
by
despised
and
she
caught
fast
her
breath
she
trembled
much
and
sudden
rose
full
height
and
stood
an
empress
in
high
womanhood
she
stood
a
tower
tall
as
when
proud
roman
mothers
suckled
men
of
truth
and
taught
them
such
xxix
her
soul
surged
vast
as
space
is
she
was
trembling
as
a
courser
when
his
thin
flank
quivers
and
his
feet
touch
velvet
on
the
turf
and
he
is
all
afoam
alert
and
fleet
as
sunlight
glancing
on
the
sea
and
full
of
triumph
before
men
at
last
she
bended
some
her
face
half
leaned
then
put
him
back
a
pace
and
met
his
eyes
calm
silently
her
eyes
looked
deep
into
his
eyes
as
maidens
down
some
mossy
well
do
peer
in
hope
by
chance
to
tell
by
image
there
what
future
lies
before
them
and
what
face
shall
be
the
of
their
destiny
pure
nature
lover
loving
him
with
love
that
made
all
pathways
dim
and
difficult
where
he
was

and
who

chide

his
ban
the
winds
breathed
warm
as
araby
she
leaned
upon
his
breast
she
lay
a
swan
with
folded
wing
he
drowned
his
hot
face
in
her
hair
he
heard
her
great
heart
rise
and
sing
he
felt
her
bosom
swell
the
air
swooned
sweet
with
perfume
of
her
form
her
breast
was
warm
her
breath
was
warm
and
warm
her
warm
and
perfumed
mouth
as
summer
journeys
through
the
south
xxx
the
argent
sea
surged
steep
below
surged
languid
in
a
tropic
glow
and
two
great
hearts
kept
surging
so
the
fervid
kiss
of
heaven
lay
precipitate
on
wood
and
sea
two
great
souls
glowed
with
ecstasy
the
sea
glowed
scarce
as
warm
as
they
xxxi
was
love
low
amber
afternoon
two
pheasants
thrummed
a
tune
a
cricket
clanged
a
restful
air
the
dreamful
billows
beat
a
rune
like
heart
regrets
around
her
head
there
shone
a
halo
men
have
said
was
from
a
dash
of
titian
that
flooded
all
her
storm
of
hair
in
gold
and
glory
but
they
knew
yea
all
men
know
there
ever
grew
a
halo
round
about
her
head
like
sunlight
scarcely
vanishèd
xxxii
how
still
she
was
she
only
knew
his
love
she
saw
no
life
beyond
she
loved
with
love
that
only
lives
outside
itself
and
selfishness
a
love
that
glows
in
its
excess
a
love
that
melts
pure
gold
and
gives
thenceforth
to
all
who
come
to
woo
no
coins
but
this
face
stamped
thereon
ay
this
one
image
stamped
upon
its
face
with
some
dim
date
long
gone
xxxiii
they
kept
the
headland
high
the
ship
below
began
to
chafe
her
chain
to
groan
as
some
great
beast
in
pain
while
white
fear
leapt
from
lip
to
lip
the
woods
are
fire
the
woods
are
flame
come
down
and
save
us
in
god
name
he
heard
he
did
not
speak
or
stir
he
thought
of
her
of
only
her
while
flames
behind
before
them
lay
to
hold
the
stoutest
heart
at
bay
strange
sounds
were
heard
far
up
the
flood
strange
savage
sounds
that
chilled
the
blood
then
sudden
from
the
dense
dark
wood
above
about
them
where
they
stood
a
thousand
beasts
came
peering
out
and
now
was
thrust
a
long
black
snout
and
now
a
tusky
mouth
it
was
a
sight
to
make
the
stoutest
pause
cut
loose
the
ship
the
black
mate
cried
cut
loose
the
ship
the
crew
replied
they
drove
into
the
sea
it
lay
as
light
as
ever
middle
day
the
while
their
bitch
that
sat
all
and
monkish
cowled
with
great
broad
floppy
leathern
ears
amid
the
men
rose
up
and
howled
and
doleful
howled
her
plaintive
fears
while
all
looked
mute
aghast
thereat
it
was
the
grimmest
eve
i
think
that
ever
hung
on
hades
brink
great
bats
possessed
the
air
bats
whirling
blindly
everywhere
it
was
such
troubled
twilight
eve
as
never
mortal
would
believe
xxxiv
some
say
the
crazed
hag
lit
the
wood
in
circle
where
the
lovers
stood
some
say
the
gray
priest
feared
the
crew
might
find
at
last
the
hoard
of
gold
long
hidden
from
the
black
ship
hold
i
doubt
me
if
men
ever
knew
but
such
mad
howling
shore
no
mortal
ever
saw
before
huge
beasts
above
that
shining
sea
wild
hideous
beasts
with
shaggy
hair
with
red
mouths
lifting
in
the
air
they
piteous
howled
and
plaintively
the
wildest
sounds
the
weirdest
sight
that
ever
shook
the
walls
of
night
how
lorn
they
howled
with
lifted
head
to
dim
and
distant
isles
that
lay
wedged
tight
along
a
line
of
red
caught
in
the
closing
gates
of
day
sky
and
sea
and
far
away
it
was
the
saddest
sound
to
hear
that
ever
struck
on
human
ear
they
doleful
called
and
answered
they
the
plaintive
far
away
the
great
that
called
from
isles
away
across
wide
watery
miles
with
dripping
mouths
and
lolling
tongue
as
if
they
called
for
captured
young
the
huge
that
called
the
whiles
their
great
wide
mouths
were
mouthing
moss
and
still
they
doleful
called
across
from
isles
beyond
the
watery
miles
no
sound
can
half
so
doleful
be
as
calling
from
the
sea
xxxv
the
drowned
sun
sank
and
died
he
lay
in
seas
of
blood
he
sinking
drew
the
gates
of
sunset
sudden
to
where
shattered
day
in
fragments
lay
and
night
came
moving
in
mad
flame
the
night
came
lighted
as
he
came
as
lighted
by
high
summer
sun
descending
through
the
burning
blue
it
was
a
gold
and
amber
hue
and
all
hues
blended
into
one
the
night
spilled
splendor
where
she
came
and
filled
the
yellow
world
with
flame
the
moon
came
on
came
leaning
low
along
the
far
aglow
she
fell
along
that
amber
flood
a
silver
flame
in
seas
of
blood
it
was
the
strangest
moon
ah
me
that
ever
settled
on
god
sea
xxxvi
slim
snakes
slid
down
from
fern
and
grass
from
wood
from
fen
from
anywhere
you
could
not
step
you
would
not
pass
and
you
would
hesitate
to
stir
lest
in
some
sudden
hurried
tread
your
foot
struck
some
unbruisèd
head
they
slid
in
streams
into
the
stream
it
seemed
like
some
infernal
dream
they
curved
and
graceful
curved
across
like
graceful
waving
moss
there
is
no
art
of
man
can
make
a
ripple
like
a
rippling
snake
xxxvii
abandoned
lorn
the
lovers
stood
abandoned
there
death
in
the
air
that
beetling
steep
that
blazing
wood
red
flame
and
red
flame
everywhere
yet
was
he
born
to
strive
to
bear
the
front
of
battle
he
would
die
in
noble
effort
and
defy
the
grizzled
visage
of
despair
he
threw
his
two
strong
arms
full
length
as
if
to
surely
test
their
strength
then
tore
his
vestments
textile
things
that
could
but
tempt
the
demon
wings
of
flame
that
girt
them
round
about
then
threw
his
garments
to
the
air
as
one
that
laughed
at
death
at
doubt
and
like
a
god
stood
grand
and
bare
she
did
not
hesitate
she
knew
the
need
of
action
swift
she
threw
her
burning
vestments
by
and
bound
her
wondrous
wealth
of
hair
that
fell
an
cloud
around
her
glorious
presence
as
he
came
to
seize
and
bear
her
through
the
flame
an
orpheus
out
of
burning
hell
he
leaned
above
her
wound
his
arm
about
her
splendor
while
the
noon
of
manhood
flushed
his
face
and
high
flames
leapt
the
high
headland
they
stood
as
statues
stand
high
lifted
in
some
storied
place
he
clasped
her
close
he
spoke
of
death
of
death
and
love
in
the
same
breath
he
clasped
her
close
her
bosom
lay
like
ship
safe
anchored
in
some
bay
xxxviii
the
flames
they
could
not
stand
or
stay
before
the
beetling
steep
the
sea
but
at
his
feet
a
narrow
way
a
short
steep
path
pitched
suddenly
safe
open
to
the
river
beach
where
lay
a
small
white
isle
in
reach
a
small
white
rippled
isle
of
sand
where
yet
the
two
might
safely
land
and
there
through
smoke
and
flame
behold
the
priest
stood
safe
yet
all
appalled
he
reached
the
cross
he
cried
he
called
he
waved
his
cross
of
gold
he
called
and
called
he
bade
them
fly
through
flames
to
him
nor

he
poised
her
held
her
high
in
air
his
great
strong
limbs
his
great
arm
length
then
turned
his
knotted
shoulders
bare
as
in
his
splendid
strength
and
strode
strode
with
a
lordly
stride
to
where
the
high
and
edge
looked
down
far
down
upon
the
molten
tide
the
flames
leapt
with
him
to
the
ledge
the
flames
leapt
leering
at
his
side
xl
he
leaned
above
the
ledge
below
he
saw
the
black
ship
idly
cruise
a
midge
below
a
mile
below
his
limbs
were
knotted
as
the
thews
of
hercules
in
his
the
flame
the
flame
the
envious
flame
she
wound
her
arms
she
wound
her
hair
about
his
tall
form
grand
and
bare
to
stay
the
fierce
flame
where
it
came
the
black
ship
like
some
moonlit
wreck
below
along
the
burning
sea
crept
on
and
on
all
silently
with
silent
pygmies
on
her
deck
that
ship
far
far
below
that
mirage
lifting
from
the
hill
his
form
began
to
grow
to
grow
and
grow
more
grandly
still
the
ship
so
small
that
form
so
tall
it
grew
to
tower
over
all
a
tall
colossus
bronze
and
gold
as
if
that
form
were
he
who
once
bestrode
the
rhodian
sea
and
ruled
the
watery
world
of
old
as
if
the
lost
colossus
stood
above
that
burning
sea
of
wood
and
she
that
shapely
form
upheld
held
high
as
if
to
touch
the
sky
what
airy
shape
how
shapely
high
a
goddess
of
the
seas
of
eld
her
hand
upheld
her
high
right
hand
as
if
she
would
forget
the
land
as
if
to
gather
stars
and
heap
the
stars
like
torches
there
to
light
her
hero
path
across
the
deep
to
some
far
isle
that
fearful
night
it
was
as
if
colossus
came
came
proudly
reaching
from
the
flame
above
the
sea
in
sheen
of
gold
his
leaping
from
his
hold
the
lost
colossus
and
his
bride
in
bronze
perfection
at
his
side
as
if
the
lost
colossus
came
companioned
from
the
past
his
bride
with
torch
all
faithful
at
his
side
with
torch
that
reached
and
rolled
through
corridors
of
gold
his
bride
austere
and
stern
and
grand
bartholdi
goddess
by
the
sea
far
lifting
lighting
liberty
from
prison
seas
to
freedom
land
xli
the
flame
the
envious
flame
it
leapt
enraged
to
see
such
majesty
such
scorn
of
death
such
kingly
scorn
then
like
some
tree
they
sank
down
in
that
flame
and
slept
and
all
was
hushed
above
that
steep
so
still
that
they
might
sleep
and
sleep
as
still
as
when
a
day
is
born
at
last
from
out
the
embers
leapt
two
shafts
of
light
above
the
night
two
wings
of
flame
that
lifting
swept
in
steady
calm
and
upward
flight
two
wings
of
flame
against
the
white
tranquil
snowy
cone
two
wings
of
love
two
wings
of
light
far
far
above
that
troubled
night
as
mounting
mounting
to
god
throne
xlii
and
all
night
long
that
upward
light
lit
up
the
bed
below
the
far
still
calling
so
it
seemed
as
they
must
call
all
night
all
night
there
was
no
night
nay
nay
there
was
no

the
night
that
lay
between
that
awful

so
in

curious
old
town
of
tiles
the
proud
french
quarter
of
days
long
gone
in
castles
of
spain
and
piles
these
wonderful
ladies
live
on
and
on
i
sit
in
the
church
where
they
come
and
go
i
dream
of
glory
that
has
long
since
gone
of
the
low
raised
high
of
the
high
brought
low
as
in
days
of
napoleon
these
piteous
places
so
rich
so
poor
one
quaint
old
church
at
the
edge
of
the
town
has
white
tombs
laid
to
the
very
church
door
white
leaves
in
the
story
of
life
turned
down
white
leaves
in
the
story
of
life
are
these
the
low
white
slabs
in
the
long
strong
grass
where
glory
has
emptied
her
and
dreams
with
the
dreamers
beneath
the
trees
i
dream
with
the
dreamers
beneath
the
sod
where
souls
pass
by
to
the
great
white
throne
i
count
each
tomb
as
a
mute
milestone
for
weary
sweet
souls
on
their
way
to
god
i
sit
all
day
by
the
vast
strong
stream
low
white
slabs
in
the
long
strong
grass
where
time
has
forgotten
for
aye
to
pass
to
dream
and
ever
to
dream
and
to
dream
this
quaint
old
church
with
its
dead
to
the
door
by
the
cypress
swamp
at
the
edge
of
the
town
so
restful
seems
that
you
want
to
sit
down
and
rest
you
and
rest
you
for
evermore
and
one
white
tomb
is
a
lowliest
tomb
that
has
crept
up
close
to
the
crumbling
door
some
penitent
soul
as
imploring
room
close
under
the
cross
that
is
leaning
is
a
low
white
slab
and
is
nameless
too
her
untold
story
why
who
should
know
yet
god
i
reckon
can
read
right
through
that
nameless
stone
to
the
bosom
below
and
the
roses
know
and
they
pity
her
too
they
bend
their
heads
in
the
sun
or
rain
and
they
read
and
they
read
and
then
read
again
as
children
reading
strange
pictures
through
why
surely
her
sleep
it
should
be
profound
for
oh
the
apples
of
gold
above
and
oh
the
blossoms
of
bridal
love
and
oh
the
roses
that
gather
around
the
sleep
of
a
night
or
a
thousand
morns
why
what
is
the
difference
here
sleeping
and
sleeping
the
years
away
with
all
earth
roses
and
none
of
its
thorns
magnolias
white
and
the
roses
red
the
here
and
the
cypress
there
sit
down
by
the
palm
at
the
feet
of
the
dead
and
hear
a
penitent
midnight
prayer
ii
the
old
churchyard
is
still
as
death
a
stranger
passes
to
and
fro
as
if
to
church
he
does
not
go
the
dead
night
does
not
draw
a
breath
a
lone
sweet
lady
prays
within
the
stranger
passes
by
the
door
will
he
not
pray
is
he
so
poor
he
has
no
prayer
for
his
sin
is
he
so
poor
his
two
strong
hands
are
full
and
heavy
as
with
gold
they
clasp
as
clasp
two
iron
bands
about
two
bags
with
eager
hold
will
he
not
pause
and
enter
in
put
down
his
heavy
load
and
rest
put
off
his
garmenting
of
sin
as
some
black
burden
from
his
breast
ah
me
the
brave
alone
can
pray
the
is
as
cannon
mouth
to
sinner
north
or
sinner
south
more
dreaded
than
dread
battle
day
now
two
men
pace
they
pace
apart
and
one
with
youth
and
truth
is
fair
the
fervid
sun
is
in
his
heart
the
tawny
south
is
in
his
hair
ay
two
men
pace
pace
left
and
right
the
lone
sweet
lady
prays
within
ay
two
men
pace
the
silent
night
kneels
down
in
prayer
for
some
sin
lo
two
men
pace
and
one
is
gray
a
man
from
land
with
something
heavy
in
each
hand
with
heavy
feet
as
feet
of
clay
ay
two
men
pace
and
one
is
light
of
step
but
still
his
brow
is
dark
his
eyes
are
as
a
kindled
spark
that
burns
beneath
the
brow
of
night
and
still
they
pace
the
stars
are
red
the
tombs
are
white
as
frosted
snow
the
silence
is
as
if
the
dead
did
pace
in
couples
to
and
fro
iii
the
azure
curtain
of
god
house
draws
back
and
hangs
to
space
i
hear
the
low
large
moon
arouse
i
see
her
lift
her
languid
face
i
see
her
shoulder
up
the
east
and
large
as
womanhood
as
for
some
ample
feast
of
gods
within
yon
she
spreads
white
palms
she
whispers
peace
sweet
peace
on
earth
for
evermore
sweet
peace
for
two
beneath
the
trees
sweet
peace
for
one
within
the
door
the
bent
stream
like
a
scimitar
flashed
in
the
sun
sweeps
on
and
on
till
sheathed
like
some
great
sword
in
seas
beneath
the
carib
star
the
high
moon
climbs
the
sapphire
hill
the
lone
sweet
lady
prays
within
the
crickets
keep
a
clang
and
din
they
are
so
loud
earth
is
so
still
and
two
men
glare
in
silence
there
the
bitter
jealous
hate
of
each
has
grown
too
deep
for
deed
or
speech
the
lone
sweet
lady
keeps
her
prayer
the
vast
moon
high
through
heaven
field
in
circling
chariot
is
rolled
the
golden
stars
are
spun
and
reeled
and
woven
into
cloth
of
gold
the
white
magnolia
fills
the
night
with
perfume
as
the
proud
moon
fills
the
glad
earth
with
her
ample
light
from
out
her
awful
sapphire
hills
white
orange
blossoms
fill
the
boughs
above
about
the
old
church
door
they
wait
the
bride
the
bridal
vows
they
never
hung
so
fair
before
the
two
men
glare
as
dark
as
sin
and
yet
all
seems
so
fair
so
white
you
would
not
reckon
it
was
night
the
while
the
lady
prays
within
iv
she
prays
so
very
long
and
late
the
two
men
weary
waiting
there
the
great
magnolia
at
the
gate
bends
drowsily
above
her
prayer
the
cypress
in
his
cloak
of
moss
that
watches
on
in
silent
gloom
has
leaned
and
shaped
a
above
the
nameless
lowly
tomb
what
can
she
pray
for
what
her
sin
what
folly
of
a
maid
so
fair
what
shadows
bind
the
wondrous
hair
of
one
who
prays
so
long
within
the
guard
in
regiment
stand
right
and
left
without
the
gate
the
trees
wait
and
wait
the
tall
magnolia
leans
intent
the
cypress
trees
on
gnarled
old
knees
far
out
the
dank
and
marshy
deep
where
slimy
monsters
groan
and
creep
kneel
with
her
in
their
marshy
seas
what
can
her
sin
be
who
shall
know
the
night
flies
by
a
bird
on
wing
the
men
no
longer
to
and
fro
stride
up
and
down
or
anything
for
one
so
weary
and
so
old
has
hardly
strength
to
stride
or
stir
he
can
but
hold
his
bags
of
gold
but
hug
his
gold
and
wait
for
her

still

perfumed

house

prayer

maiden
keeps
her
holy
place

scarce
lifts

light
man
way
with
heaven
light
a
godless
man
with
bags
of
gold
i
think
a
most
unholy
sight
ah
who
so
desolate
at
night
amid
death
sleepers
still
and
cold
a
godless
man
on
holy
ground
i
think
a
most
unholy
sight
i
hear
death
trailing
like
a
hound
hard
after
him
and
swift
to
bite
vi
the
vast
moon
settles
to
the
west
two
men
beside
a
nameless
tomb
and
one
would
sit
thereon
to
rest
ay
rest
below
if
there
were
room
what
is
this
rest
of
death
sweet
friend
what
is
the
rising
up
and
where
i
say
death
is
a
lengthened
prayer
a
longer
night
a
larger
end
hear
you
the
lesson
i
once
learned
i
died
i
sailed
a
million
miles
through
dreamful
flowery
restful
isles
she
was
not
there
and
i
returned
i
say
the
shores
of
death
and
sleep
are
one
that
when
we
wearied
come
to
lethe
waters
and
lie
dumb
is
death
not
sleep
holds
us
to
keep
yea
we
lie
dead
for
need
of
rest
and
so
the
soul
drifts
out
and
the
vast
still
waters
to
the
shore
beyond
in
pleasant
tranquil
quest
it
sails
straight
on
forgetting
pain
past
isles
of
peace
to
perfect
rest
now
were
it
best
abide
or
best
return
and
take
up
life
again
and
that
is
all
of
death
there
is
believe
me
if
you
find
your
love
in
that
far
land
then
like
the
dove
abide
and
turn
not
back
to
this
but
if
you
find
your
love
not
there
or
if
your
feet
feel
sure
and
you
have
still
allotted
work
to
do
why
then
return
to
toil
and
care
death
is
no
mystery
is
plain
if
death
be
mystery
then
sleep
is
mystery
thrice
strangely
deep
for
oh
this
coming
back
again
austerest
ferryman
of
souls
i
see
the
gleam
of
solid
shores
i
hear
thy
steady
stroke
of
oars
above
the
wildest
wave
that
rolls
o
charon
keep
thy
sombre
ships
we
come
with
neither
myrrh
nor
balm
nor
silver
piece
in
open
palm
but
lone
white
silence
on
our
lips
vii
she
prays
so
long
she
prays
so
late
what
sin
in
all
this
against
her
supplicating
hand
could
have
in
heaven
any
weight
prays
she
for
her
sweet
self
alone
prays
she
for
some
one
far
away
or
some
one
near
and
dear
or
some
poor
lorn
lost
soul
unknown
it
seems
to
me
a
selfish
thing
to
pray
forever
for
one
self
it
seems
to
me
like
heaping
pelf
in
heaven
by
hard
reckoning
why
i
would
rather
stoop
and
bear
my
load
of
sin
and
bear
it
well
and
bravely
down
to
burning
hell
than
ever
pray
one
selfish
prayer
viii
the
swift
chameleon
in
the
gloom
this
silence
it
is
so
profound
forsakes
its
bough
glides
to
the
ground
then
up
and
lies
across
the
tomb
it
erst
was
green
as
it
then
grew
gray
as
myrtle
moss
the
time
it
slid
the
moss
across
but
now
is
with
grief
the
little
creature
hues
are
gone
here
in
the
pale
and
ghostly
light
it
lies
so
pale
so
panting
white
white
as
the
tomb
it
lies
upon
the
two
men
by
that
nameless
tomb
and
both
so
still
you
might
have
said
these
two
men
they
are
also
dead
and
only
waiting
here
for
room
how
still
beneath
the
how
tall
was
one
how
bowed
was
one
the
one
was
as
a
journey
done
the
other
as
beginning
now
and
one
was
young
young
with
that
youth
eternal
that
belongs
to
truth
and
one
was
old
old
with
the
years
that
follow
fast
on
doubts
and
fears
and
yet
the
habit
of
command
was
his
in
every
stubborn
part
no
common
knave
was
he
at
heart
nor
his
the
common
coward
hand
he
looked
the
young
man
in
the
face
so
full
of
hate
so
frank
of
hate
the
other
standing
in
his
place
stared
back
as
straight
and
hard
as
fate
and
now
he
sudden
turned
away
and
now
he
paced
the
path
and
now
came
back
beneath
the
with
lips
as
cold
as
clay
as
mute
as
shadows
on
a
wall
as
silent
still
as
dark
as
they
before
that
stranger
bent
and
gray
the
youth
stood
scornful
proud
and
tall
he
stood
a
tall
with
spanish
daggers
guarding
it
nor
deed
nor
word
to
him
seemed
fit
while
she
prayed
on
so
silently
he
slew
his
rival
with
his
eyes
his
eyes
were
daggers
piercing
deep
so
deep
that
blood
began
to
creep
from
their
deep
wounds
and
drop
wordwise
his
eyes
so
black
so
bright
that
they
might
raise
the
dead
the
living
slay
if
but
the
dead
the
living
bore
such
hearts
as
heroes
had
of
yore
two
deadly
arrows
barbed
in
black
and
feathered
too
with
raven
wing
two
arrows
that
could
silent
sting
and
with
a
answer
back
how
fierce
he
was
how
deadly
still
in
that
mesmeric
hateful
stare
turned
on
the
pleading
stranger
there
that
drew
to
him
despite
his
will
so
like
a
bird
down
down
beneath
a
snake
bright
eyes
he
stood
a
fascinated
thing
that
hopeless
unresisting
dies
he
raised
a
hard
hand
as
before
reached
out
the
gold
and
offered
it
with
hand
that
shook
as
the
while
the
youth
but
scorned
the
more
you
will
not
touch
it
in
god
name
who
are
you
and
what
are
you
then
come
take
this
gold
and
be
of
men
a
human
form
with
human
aim
yea
take
this
gold
she
must
be
mine
she
shall
be
mine
i
do
not
fear
your
scowl
your
scorn
your
soul
austere
the
living
dead
or
your
dark
sign
i
saw
her
as
she
entered
there
i
saw
her
and
uncovered
stood
the
perfume
of
her
womanhood
was
holy
incense
on
the
air
she
left
behind
sweet
sanctity
religion
lay
the
way
she
went
i
cried
i
would
repent
repent
she
passed
on
all
unheeding
me
her
soul
is
young
her
eyes
are
bright
and
gladsome
as
mine
own
are
dim
but
oh
i
felt
my
senses
swim
the
time
she
passed
me
by
the
time
she
passed
nor
raised
her
eyes
to
hear
me
cry
i
would
repent
nor
turned
her
head
to
hear
my
cries
but
swifter
went
the
way
she
went
went
swift
as
youth
for
all
these
years
and
this
the
strangest
thing
appears
that
lady
there
seems
just
the
same
sweet
gladys
ah
you
know
her
name
you
hear
her
name
and
start
that
i
should
name
her
dear
name
trembling
so
why
boy
when
i
shall
come
to
die
that
name
shall
be
the
last
i
know
that
name
shall
be
the
last
sweet
name
my
lips
shall
utter
in
this
life
that
name
is
brighter
than
bright
flame
that
lady
is
my
wedded
wife
ah
start
and
catch
your
burning
breath
ah
start
and
clutch
your
deadly
knife
if
this
be
death
then
be
it
death
but
that
loved
lady
is
my
wife
yea
you
are
stunned
your
face
is
white
that
i
should
come
confronting
you
as
comes
a
lorn
ghost
of
the
night
from
out
the
past
and
to
pursue
you
thought
me
dead
you
shake
your
head
you
start
back
horrified
to
know
that
she
is
loved
that
she
is
wed
that
you
have
sinned
in
loving
so
yet
what
seems
strange
that
lady
there
housed
in
the
holy
house
of
prayer
seems
just
the
same
for
all
her
tears
for
all
my
absent
twenty
years
yea
twenty
years
just
twenty
years
this
day
this
hour
since
first
i
plucked
that
perfect
flower
and
not
one
witness
of
the
rite
nay
do
not
doubt
i
tell
you
true
her
prayers
her
tears
her
constancy
are
all
for
me
are
all
for
me
and
not
one
single
thought
for
you
i
knew
i
knew
she
would
be
here
this
night
of
nights
to
pray
for
me
and
how
could
i
for
twenty
year
know
this
same
night
so
certainly
ah
me
some
thoughts
that
we
would
drown
stick
closer
than
a
brother
to
the
conscience
and
pursue
pursue
like
baying
hound
to
hunt
us
down
and
then
that
date
is
history
for
on
that
night
this
shore
was
shelled
and
many
a
noble
mansion
felled
with
many
a
noble
family
i
wore
the
blue
i
watched
the
flight
of
shells
like
stars
tossed
through
the
air
to
blow
your
anywhere
that
wild
illuminated
night
nay
rage
befits
you
not
so
well
why
you
were
but
a
babe
at
best
your
cradle
some
sharp
bursted
shell
that
tore
maybe
your
mother
breast
hear
me
we
came
in
honored
war
the
risen
world
was
on
your
track
the
whole
was
at
our
back
from
hudson
bank
to
the
north
star
and
from
the
north
to
sea
the
splendid
fiery
cyclone
swept
your
fathers
fell
your
mothers
wept
their
nude
babes
clinging
to
the
knee
a
wide
and
desolated
track
behind
a
path
of
ruin
lay
before
some
women
by
the
way
stood
mutely
gazing
clad
in
black
from
silent
women
waiting
there
some
tears
came
down
like
still
small
rain
their
own
sons
on
the
battle
plain
were
now
but
viewless
ghosts
of
air
their
own
dear
daring
boys
in
gray
they
should
not
see
them
any
more
our
cruel
drums
kept
telling
the
time
their
own
sons
went
away
through
burning
town
by
bursting
shell
yea
i
remember
well
that
night
i
led
through
of
light
as
through
some
hot
outpost
of
hell
that
night
of
and
shell
sent
from
your
surging
river
breast
to
waken
me
no
more
to
rest
that
night
i
should
remember
well
that
night
amid
the
maimed
and
dead
a
night
in
history
set
down
by
light
of
many
a
burning
town
and
written
all
across
in
red
her
father
dead
her
brothers
dead
her
home
in
flames
what
else
could
she
but
fly
all
helpless
here
to
me
a
fluttered
dove
that
night
of
dread
short
time
hot
time
had
i
to
woo
amid
the
red
shells
but
women
rarely
reckon
time
and
perils
speed
their
love
when
true
and
then
i
wore
a
captain
sword
and
too
had
oftentime
before
doffed
cap
at
her
dead
father
door
and
passed
a
soldier
pleasant
word
and
then
ah
i
was
comely
then
i
bore
no
load
upon
my
back
i
heard
no
hounds
upon
my
track
but
stood
the
tallest
of
tall
men
her
father
and
her
mother
shrine
this
church
amid
the
orange
wood
so
near
and
so
secure
it
stood
it
seemed
to
beckon
as
a
sign
its
white
cross
seemed
to
beckon
me
my
heart
was
strong
and
it
was
mine
to
throw
myself
upon
my
knee
to
beg
to
lead
her
to
this
shrine
she
did
consent
through
lanes
of
light
i
led
through
that
that
night
let
fall
your
hand
take
back
your
face
and
stand
stand
patient
in
your
place
she
loved
me
and
she
loves
me
still
yea
she
clung
close
to
me
that
hour
as
to
and
still
is
mine
through
good
or
the
priest
stood
there
he
spake
the
prayer
he
made
the
holy
mystic
sign
and
she
was
mine
was
wholly
mine
is
mine
this
moment
i
will
swear
then
days
then
nights
of
vast
delight
then
came
a
doubtful
later
day
the
faithful
priest
now
far
away
watched
with
the
dying
in
the
fight
the
priest
amid
the
dying
dead
kept
duty
on
the
that
midnight
marriage
unrevealed
kept
strange
thoughts
running
through
my
head
at
last
a
stray
ball
struck
the
priest
this
vestibule
his
chancel
was
and
now
none
lived
to
speak
her
cause
record
or
champion
her
the
least
hear
me
i
had
been
bred
to
hate
all
priests
their
mummeries
and
all
ah
it
was
fate
ah
it
was
fate
that
all
things
tempted
me
to
fall
and
then
the
rattling
songs
we
sang
those
nights
when
rudely
revelling
the
songs
that
only
soldiers
sing
until
the
very
rang
what
is
the
rhyme
that
rhymers
say
of
maidens
born
to
be
betrayed
by
epaulettes
and
shining
blade
while
soldiers
love
and
ride
away
and
then
my
comrades
spake
her
name
half
taunting
with
a
touch
of
shame
taught
me
to
hold
that
as
some
light
pastime
of
the
hour
and
then
the
ruin
in
the
land
the
death
dismay
the
lawlessness
men
gathered
gold
on
every
hand
heaped
gold
and
why
should
i
do
less
the
cry
for
gold
was
in
the
air
for
creole
gold
for
precious
things
the
sword
kept
prodding
here
and
there
through
bolts
and
sacred
fastenings
gold
get
gold
this
was
the
cry
and
i
loved
gold
what
else
could
i
or
you
or
any
earnest
one
born
in
this
getting
age
have
done
with
this
one
lesson
taught
from
youth
and
ever
taught
us
to
get
gold
to
get
and
hold
and
ever
hold
what
else
could
i
have
done
forsooth
she
seeing
how
i
sought
for
gold
this
girl
my
wife
one
late
night
told
of
treasures
hidden
close
at
hand
in
her
dead
father
mellow
land
of
gold
she
helped
her
brothers
hide
beneath
a
broad
banana
tree
the
day
the
two
in
battle
died
the
night
she
dying
fled
to
me
it
seemed
too
good
i
laughed
to
scorn
her
trustful
tale
she
answered
not
but
meekly
on
the
morrow
morn
two
massive
bags
of
bright
gold
brought
and
when
she
brought
this
gold
to
me
red
creole
gold
rich
rare
and
old
when
i
at
last
had
gold
sweet
gold
i
cried
in
very
ecstasy
red
gold
rich
gold
two
bags
of
gold
the
two
stout
bags
of
gold
she
brought
and
gave
with
scarce
a
second
thought
why
her
two
hands
could
hardly
hold
now
i
had
gold
two
bags
of
gold
two
wings
of
gold
to
fly
and
fly
the
wide
world
girth
red
gold
to
hold
against
my
heart
for
aye
and
aye
my
country
lesson
get
gold
i
learned
it
well
in
land
of
snow
and
what
can
glow
so
brightly
glow
long
winter
nights
of
northern
cold
ay
now
at
last
at
last
i
had
the
one
thing
all
fair
things
above
my
land
had
taught
me
most
to
love
a
miser
now
and
i
grew
mad
with
those
two
bags
of
gold
my
own
i
then
began
to
plan
that
night
for
flight
for
far
and
sudden
flight
for
flight
and
too
for
flight
alone
i
feared
i
feared
my
heart
grew
cold
some
one
might
claim
this
gold
of
me
i
feared
her
feared
her
purity
feared
all
things
but
my
bags
of
gold
i
grew
to
hate
her
face
her
creed
that
face
the
fairest
ever
yet
that
bowed
holy
cross
or
bead
or
yet
was
in
god
image
set
i
fled
nay
not
so
knavish
low
as
you
have
fancied
did
i
fly
i
sought
her
at
that
shrine
and
i
told
her
full
frankly
i
should
go
i
stood
a
giant
in
my
power
and
did
she
question
or
dispute
i
stood
a
savage
selfish
brute
she
bowed
her
head
a
and
when
i
sudden
turned
to
go
and
told
her
i
should
come
no
more
she
bowed
her
head
so
low
so
low
her
vast
black
hair
fell
pouring
and
that
was
all
her
splendid
face
was
mantled
from
me
and
her
night
of
hair
half
hid
her
from
my
sight
as
she
fell
moaning
in
her
place
and
there
her
dark
night
of
hair
she
sobbed
low
moaning
through
her
tears
that
she
would
wait
wait
all
the
years
would
wait
and
pray
in
her
despair
nay
did
not
murmur
not
deny
she
did
not
cross
me
one
sweet
word
i
turned
and
fled
i
thought
i
heard
a
piercing
low
the
rhyme
of
the
great
river
part
ii
how
soft
this
moonlight
of
the
south
how
sweet
my
south
in
soft
moonlight
i
want
to
kiss
her
warm
sweet
mouth
as
she
lies
sleeping
here
how
still
i
do
not
hear
a
mouse
i
see
some
bursting
buds
appear
i
hear
god
in
his
garden
hear
him
trim
some
flowers
for
his
house
i
hear
some
singing
stars
the
mouth
of
my
vast
river
sings
and
sings
and
pipes
on
reeds
of
pleasant
things
of
splendid
promise
for
my
south
my
great
soon
to
rise
and
tiptoe
up
and
loose
her
hair
tiptoe
and
take
from
all
the
skies
god
stars
and
glorious
moon
to
wear
i
the
poet
shall
create
or
kill
bid
heroes
live
bid
braggarts
die
i
look
against
a
lurid
sky
my
silent
south
lies
proudly
still
the
lurid
light
of
burning
lands
still
climbs
to
god
house
overhead
mute
women
wring
white
withered
hands
their
eyes
are
red
their
skies
are
red
poor
man
still
boast
your
bitter
wars
still
burn
and
burn
and
burning
die
but
god
white
finger
spins
the
stars
in
calm
dominion
of
the
sky
and
not
one
ray
of
light
the
less
comes
down
to
bid
the
grasses
spring
no
drop
of
dew
nor
anything
shall
fail
for
all
your
bitterness
the
land
that
nursed
a
nation
youth
ye
burned
it
sacked
it
sapped
it
dry
ye
gave
it
falsehoods
for
its
truth
and
fame
was
fashioned
from
a
lie
if
man
grows
large
is
god
the
less
the
moon
shall
rise
and
set
the
same
the
great
sun
spill
his
splendid
flame
and
clothe
the
world
in
queenliness
and
from
that
very
soil
ye
trod
some
seeing
youth
shall
come
some
day
and
he
shall
not
be
dumb
before
the
awful
court
of
god
ii
the
weary
moon
had
turned
away
the
far
was
turning
pale
to
hear
the
stranger
boastful
tale
of
blood
and
flame
that
battle
day
and
yet
again
the
two
men
glared
close
face
to
face
above
that
tomb
each
seemed
as
jealous
of
the
room
the
other
eager
waiting
shared
again
the
man
began
to
say
as
taking
up
some
broken
thread
as
talking
to
the
patient
dead
the
creole
was
as
still
as
they
that
night
we
burned
yon
town
the
grasses
vines
are
reaching
up
the
ruins
they
are
reaching
down
as
soldiers
when
they
sup
i
knew
her
knew
her
constancy
she
said
this
night
of
every
year
she
here
would
come
and
kneeling
here
would
pray
the
night
for
me
this
praying
seems
a
splendid
thing
it
drives
old
time
the
other
way
it
makes
him
lose
all
reckoning
of
years
that
pagans
have
to
pay
this
praying
seems
a
splendid
thing
it
makes
me
stronger
as
she
prays
but
oh
the
bitter
bitter
days
when
i
became
a
banished
thing
i
fled
took
ship
i
fled
as
far
as
far
ships
drive
the
for
i
did
hate
the
south
the
sun
that
made
me
think
what
i
had
done
i
could
not
see
a
fair
in
foreign
land
in
pleasant
place
but
it
would
whisper
of
her
face
and
shake
its
keen
sharp
blades
at
me
each
woman
would
recall
a
lone
a
face
a
name
a
coward
flight
a
soldier
shame
i
fled
from
woman
face
from
all
i
hugged
my
gold
my
precious
gold
within
my
strong
stout
buckskin
vest
i
wore
my
bags
against
my
breast
so
close
i
felt
my
heart
grow
cold
i
did
not
like
to
see
it
now
i
did
not
spend
one
single
piece
i
travelled
travelled
without
cease
as
far
as
russian
ship
could
plow
and
when
my
own
scant
hoard
was
gone
and
i
had
reached
the
far
i
took
my
two
stout
bags
in
hand
as
one
pursued
and
journeyed
on
ah
i
was
weary
i
grew
gray
i
felt
the
fast
years
slip
and
reel
as
slip
black
beads
when
maidens
kneel
at
altars
when
is
gay
at
last
i
fell
prone
in
the
road
fell
fainting
with
my
cursèd
load
a
cossack
helped
me
bear
my
bags
nor
would
one
shilling
share
he
looked
at
me
with
proud
disdain
he
looked
at
me
as
if
he
knew
his
black
eyes
burned
me
thro
and
thro
his
scorn
pierced
like
a
deadly
pain
he
frightened
me
with
honesty
he
made
me
feel
so
small
so
base
i
fled
as
if
the
fiend
kept
chase
the
fiend
that
claims
my
company
i
bore
my
load
alone
i
crept
far
up
the
steep
and
icy
way
and
there
before
a
cross
there
lay
a
barefoot
priest
who
bowed
and
wept
i
threw
my
gold
right
down
and
sped
straight
on
and
oh
my
heart
was
light
a
bird
in
flight
flies
not
so
happy
as
i
fled
i
felt
somehow
this
monk
would
take
my
gold
my
load
from
off
my
back
would
turn
the
fiend
from
off
my
track
would
take
my
gold
for
sweet
christ
sake
i
fled
i
did
not
look
behind
i
fled
fled
with
the
mountain
wind
at
last
far
down
the
mountain
base
i
found
a
pleasant
i
rested
there
so
long
so
well
more
grateful
than
all
tongues
can
tell
it
was
such
pleasant
thing
to
hear
that
valley
voices
calm
and
clear
that
valley
veiled
in
mountain
air
with
white
goats
on
the
hills
at
morn
that
valley
green
with
seas
of
corn
with
cottage
islands
here
and
there
i
watched
the
mountain
girls
the
hay
they
mowed
was
not
more
sweet
than
they
they
laid
brown
hands
in
my
white
hair
they
marvelled
at
my
face
of
care
i
tried
to
laugh
i
could
but
weep
i
made
these
peasants
one
request
that
i
with
them
might
toil
or
rest
and
with
them
sleep
the
long
last
sleep
i
begged
that
i
might
battle
there
for
that
fair
for
those
who
gave
me
cheer
when
girt
with
foes
and
have
a
country
loved
and
fair
where
is
that
spot
that
poets
name
our
country
name
the
hallowed
land
where
is
that
spot
where
man
must
stand
or
fall
when
girt
with
sword
and
flame
where
is
that
one
permitted
spot
where
is
the
one
place
man
must
fight
where
rests
the
one
right
to
fight
as
ever
patriots
fought
i
say
is
in
that
holy
house
where
god
first
set
us
down
on
earth
where
mother
welcomed
us
at
birth
and
bared
her
breasts
a
happy
spouse
but
when
some
wrong
some
deed
of
shame
shall
make
that
land
no
more
our
own
ah
hunger
for
that
holy
name
my
country
i
have
truly
known
the
simple
from
his
field
looks
forth
he
sees
god
purple
wall
encircling
him
high
over
all
the
vast
sun
wheels
his
shining
shield
this
king
who
makes
earth
what
it
is
king
david
bending
to
his
toil
o
lord
and
master
of
the
soil
how
envied
in
thy
loyal
bliss
long
live
the
land
we
loved
in
youth
that
world
with
blue
skies
bent
about
where
never
entered
ugly
doubt
long
live
the
simple
homely
truth
can
true
hearts
love
some
far
some
bleak
alaska
bought
with
gold
god
laws
are
old
as
love
is
old
and
home
is
something
near
at
hand
yea
change
yon
river
course
estrange
the
seven
sweet
stars
make
hate
divide
the
full
moon
from
the
flowing
tide
but
this
old
truth
ye
can
not
change
i
begged
a
land
as
begging
bread
i
begged
of
these
brave
mountaineers
to
share
their
sorrows
share
their
tears
to
weep
as
they
wept
with
their
dead
they
did
consent
the
mountain
town
was
mine
to
love
and
valley
lands
that
night
the
barefoot
monk
came
down
and
laid
my
two
bags
in
my
hands
on
on
and
oh
the
load
i
bore
why
once
i
dreamed
my
soul
was
lead
dreamed
once
it
was
a
body
dead
it
made
my
cold
hard
bosom
sore
i
dragged
that
body
forth
and
back
o
conscience
what
a
baying
hound
nor
frozen
seas
nor
frosted
ground
can
throw
this
bloodhound
from
his
track
in
farthest
russia
i
lay
down
a
dying
man
at
last
to
rest
i
felt
such
load
upon
my
breast
as
seamen
feel
who
sinking
drown
that
night
all
chill
and
desperate
i
sprang
up
for
i
could
not
rest
i
tore
the
two
bags
from
my
breast
and
dashed
them
in
the
burning
grate
i
then
crept
back
into
my
bed
i
tried
i
begged
i
prayed
to
sleep
but
those
red
restless
coins
would
keep
slow
dropping
dropping
and
blood
red
i
heard
them
clink
and
clink
and
clink
they
turned
they
talked
within
that
grate
they
talked
of
her
they
made
me
think
of
one
who
still
must
pray
and
wait
and
when
the
bags
burned
crisp
and
black
two
coins
did
start
roll
to
the
floor
roll
out
roll
on
and
then
roll
back
as
if
they
needs
must
journey
more
ah
then
i
knew
nor
change
nor
space
nor
all
the
drowning
years
that
rolled
could
hide
from
me
her
haunting
face
nor
still
that
talking
gold
again
i
sprang
forth
from
my
bed
i
shook
as
in
an
ague
fit
i
clutched
that
red
gold
burning
red
i
clutched
as
if
to
strangle
it
i
clutched
it
up
you
hear
me
boy
i
clutched
it
up
with
joyful
tears
i
clutched
it
close
with
such
wild
joy
i
had
not
felt
for
years
and
years
such
joy
for
i
should
now
retrace
my
steps
should
see
my
land
her
face
bring
back
her
gold
this
battle
day
and
see
her
see
her
hear
her
pray
i
brought
it
back
you
hear
me
boy
i
clutch
it
hold
it
hold
it
now
red
gold
bright
gold
that
giveth
joy
to
all
and
anywhere
or
how
that
giveth
joy
to
all
but
me
to
all
but
me
yet
soon
to
all
it
burns
my
hands
it
burns
but
she
shall
ope
my
hands
and
let
it
fall
for
oh
i
have
a
willing
hand
to
give
these
bags
of
gold
to
see
her
smile
as
once
she
smiled
on
me
here
in
this
pleasant
warm
he
ceased
he
thrust
each
fist
he
threw
his
gold
hard
forth
again
as
one
impelled
by
some
mad
pain
he
would
not
or
could
not
resist
the
creole
scorning
turned
away
as
if
he
turned
from
that
lost
thief
the
one
that
died
without
belief
that
awful
crucifixion
day
iii
believe
in
man
nor
turn
away
lo
man
advances
year
by
year
time
bears
him
upward
and
his
sphere
of
life
must
broaden

by
day

in

with
large
belief
the
garnered
grain
each
hath
promise
roundness
and
full
prime
for
all
the
empty
chaff
and
sheaf

in
man
with
proud
belief
truth
keeps
the
bottom
of
her

and
when
the
thief
peeps
down
the
thief
peeps
back
at
him
perpetual
faint

that
this
or
that
man
fell
for

lo
christ
himself
chose
only
twelve
yet
one
of
these
turned
out
a
thief
iv
down
through
the
dark
magnolia
leaves
where
climbs
the
rose
of
cherokee
against
the
tree
a
loom
of
moonlight
weaves
and
weaves
a
loom
of
moonlight
weaving
clothes
from
rose
of
cherokee
and
bridal
blooms
of
for
fairy
folk
in
fragrant
rose
down
through
the
mournful
myrtle
crape
through
moving
moss
through
ghostly
gloom
a
long
white
moonbeam
takes
a
shape
above
a
nameless
lowly
tomb
a
long
white
finger
through
the
gloom
of
grasses
gathered
round
about
as
god
white
finger
pointing
out
a
name
upon
that
nameless
tomb
her
white
face
bowed
in
her
black
hair
the
maiden
prays
so
still
within
that
you
might
hear
a
falling
pin
ay
hear
her
white
unuttered
prayer
the
moon
has
grown
disconsolate
has
turned
her
down
her
walk
of
stars
why
she
is
shutting
up
her
bars
as
maidens
shut
a
lover
gate
the
moon
has
grown
disconsolate
she
will
no
longer
watch
and
wait
but
two
men
wait
and
two
men
will
wait
on
till
morning
mute
and
still
still
wait
and
walk
among
the
trees
quite
careless
if
the
moon
may
keep
her
walk
along
her
starry
steep
above
the
southern
seas
they
know
no
moon
or
set
or
rise
of
stars
or
anything
to
light
the
earth
or
skies
save
her
dark
eyes
this
praying
waking
watching
night
they
move
among
the
tombs
apart
their
eyes
turn
ever
to
that
door
they
know
the
worn
walks
there
by
heart
they
turn
and
walk
them
and
they
are
not
wide
these
little
walks
for
dead
folk
by
this
crescent
town
they
lie
right
close
when
they
lie
down
as
if
they
kept
up
quiet
talks
vi
the
two
men
keep
their
paths
apart
but
more
and
more
begins
to
stoop
the
man
with
gold
as
droop
and
droop
tall
plants
with
something
at
their
heart
now
once
again
with
eager
zest
he
offers
gold
with
silent
speech
the
other
will
not
walk
in
reach
but
walks
around
as
round
a
pest
his
dark
eyes
sweep
the
scene
around
his
young
face
drinks
the
fragrant
air
his
dark
eyes
journey
everywhere
the
other
cleave
unto
the
ground
it
is
a
weary
walk
for
him
for
oh
he
bears
a
weary
load
he
does
not
like
that
narrow
road
between
the
dead
it
is
so
dim
it
is
so
dark
that
narrow
place
where
graves
lie
thick
like
yellow
leaves
give
us
the
light
of
christ
and
grace
give
light
to
garner
in
the
sheaves
give
light
of
love
for
gold
is
cold
and
gold
is
cruel
as
a
crime
it
gives
no
light
at
such
sad
time
as
when
man
feet
wax
weak
and
old
ay
gold
is
heavy
hard
and
cold
and
have
i
said
this
thing
before
well
i
will
tell
it
and
need
be
told
ten
thousand
fold
give
us
this
day
our
daily
bread
get
this
of
god
then
all
the
rest
is
housed
in
thine
own
honest
breast
if
you
but
lift
a
lordly
head
vii
oh
i
have
seen
men
tall
and
fair
stoop
down
their
manhood
with
disgust
stoop
down
god
image
to
the
dust
to
get
a
load
of
gold
to
bear
have
seen
men
selling
day
by
day
the
glance
of
manhood
that
god
gave
to
sell
god
image
as
a
slave
might
sell
some
little
pot
of
clay
behold
here
in
this
green
graveyard
a
man
with
gold
enough
to
fill
a
coffin
as
a
miller
till
and
yet
his
path
is
hard
so
hard
his
feet
keep
sinking
in
the
sand
and
now
so
near
an
opened
grave
he
seems
to
hear
the
solemn
wave
of
dread
oblivion
at
hand
the
sands
they
grumble
so
it
seems
as
if
he
walks
some
shelving
brink
he
tries
to
stop
he
tries
to
think
he
tries
to
make
believe
he
dreams
why
he
is
free
to
leave
the
land
the
silver
moon
is
white
as
dawn
why
he
has
gold
in
either
hand
has
silver
ways
to
walk
upon
and
who
should
chide
or
bid
him
stay
or
taunt
or
threat
or
bid
him
fly
the
world
for
sale
i
hear
men
say
and
yet
this
man
has
gold
to
buy
buy
what
buy
rest
he
could
not
rest
buy
gentle
sleep
he
could
not
sleep
though
all
these
graves
were
wide
and
deep
as
their
wide
mouths
with
the
request
buy
love
buy
faith
buy
truth
buy
moonlight
sunlight
present
past
buy
but
one
brimful
cup
of
youth
that
calm
souls
drink
of
to
the
last
o
god
is
pitiful
to
see
this
miser
so
forlorn
and
old
o
god
how
poor
a
man
may
be
with
nothing
in
this
world
but
gold
viii
the
broad
magnolia
blooms
are
white
her
blooms
are
large
as
if
the
moon
had
lost
her
way
some
lazy
night
and
lodged
here
till
the
afternoon
oh
vast
white
blossoms
breathing
love
white
bosom
of
my
lady
dead
in
your
white
heaven
overhead
i
look
and
learn
to
look
above
ix
all
night
the
tall
magnolia
kept
kind
watch
above
the
nameless
tomb
two
shapes
kept
waiting
in
the
gloom
and
gray
of
morn
where
roses
wept
the
roses
wept
their
eyes
all
dew
their
breath
as
sweet
as
prayer
and
as
they
wept
the
dead
down
there
did
feel
their
tears
and
hear
their
sighs
the
grass
uprose
as
if
afraid
some
stranger
foot
might
press
too
near
its
every
blade
was
like
a
spear
its
every
spear
a
living
blade
the
grass
above
that
nameless
tomb
stood
all
arrayed
as
if
afraid
some
weary
pilgrim
seeking
room
and
rest
might
lay
where
she
was
laid
x
was
morn
and
yet
it
was
not
morn
was
morn
in
heaven
not
on
earth
a
star
was
singing
of
a
birth
just
saying
that
a
day
was
born
the
marsh
hard
by
that
bound
the
lake
the
great
low
ponchartrain
shut
off
from
sultry
cuban
main
drew
up
its
legs
as
half
awake
drew
long
stork
legs
long
legs
that
steep
in
slime
where
alligators
creep
drew
long
green
legs
that
stir
the
grass
as
when
the
late
lorn
pass
then
from
the
marsh
came
croakings
low
then
louder
croaked
some
beast
then
far
away
against
the
east
god
rose
of
morn
began
to
grow
from
out
the
marsh
against
that
east
a
ghostly
cypress
stood
with
ragged
arms
above
the
wood
it
rose
a
beast
it
seemed
so
frightened
where
it
rose
the
thing
it
seemed
to
wave
the
garments
of
the
grave
to
wave
and
wave
its
old
close
by
a
cow
rose
up
and
lowed
from
out
a
a
black
boy
on
the
river
road
fled
sudden
as
the
night
had
fled
a
nude
black
boy
a
bit
of
night
that
had
been
broken
off
and
lost
from
flying
night
the
time
it
crossed
the
surging
river
in
its
flight
a
bit
of
darkness
following
the
sable
night
on
sable
wing
a
bit
of
darkness
stilled
with
fear
because
that
nameless
tomb
was
near
then
holy
bells
came
pealing
out
then
steamboats
blew
then
horses
neighed
then
smoke
from
hamlets
round
about
crept
out
as
if
no
more
afraid
then
shrill
cocks
here
and
shrill
cocks
there
stretched
glossy
necks
and
filled
the
air
how
many
cocks
it
takes
to
make
a
country
morning
well
awake
then
many
boughs
with
many
birds
young
boughs
in
green
old
boughs
in
gray
these
birds
had
very
much
to
say
in
their
soft
sweet
familiar
words
and
all
seemed
sudden
glad
the
gloom
forgot
the
church
forgot
the
tomb
and
yet
like
monks
with
cross
and
bead
the
myrtles
leaned
to
read
and
read
and
oh
the
fragrance
of
the
sod
and
oh
the
perfume
of
the
air
the
sweetness
sweetness
everywhere
that
rose
like
incense
up
to
god
i
like
a
cow
breath
in
sweet
spring
i
like
the
breath
of
babes
a
maid
breath
is
a
pleasant
thing
but
oh
the
breath
of
sudden
morn
of
sudden
morn
when
every
pore
of
mother
earth
is
pulsing
fast
with
life
and
life
seems
spilling
with
love
with
love
too
sweet
to
last
of
sudden
morn
beneath
the
sun
by
god
great
river
wrapped
in
gray
that
for
a
space
forgets
to
run
and
hides
his
face
as
if
to
pray
xi
the
creole
kept
his
eyes
turned
to
the
door
as
eyes
might
turn
to
see
the
holy
embers
burn
some
sin
away
at
sacrifice
full
dawn
but
yet
he
knew
no
dawn
nor
song
of
bird
nor
bird
on
wing
nor
breath
of
rose
nor
anything
her
fair
face
lifted
not
upon
and
yet
he
taller
stood
with
morn
his
bright
eyes
brighter
than
before
burned
fast
against
that
fastened
door
his
proud
lips
lifting
up
with
scorn
with
lofty
silent
scorn
for
one
who
all
night
long
had
plead
and
plead
with
none
to
witness
but
the
dead
how
he
for
gold
must
be
undone
oh
ye
who
feed
a
greed
for
gold
and
barter
truth
and
trade
sweet
youth
for
cold
hard
gold
behold
behold
behold
this
man
behold
this
truth
why
what
is
there
in
all
god
plan
of
vast
creation
high
or
low
by
sea
or
land
by
sun
or
snow
so
mean
so
miserly
as
man
lo
earth
and
heaven
all
let
go
their
garnered
riches
year
by
year
the
treasures
of
the
trackless
snow
ah
hast
thou
seen
how
very
dear
the
wide
earth
gives
gives
golden
grain
gives
fruits
of
gold
gives
all
gives
all
hold
forth
your
hand
and
these
shall
fall
in
your
full
palm
as
free
as
rain
yea
earth
is
generous
the
trees
strip
nude
as
without
fear
and
their
reward
is
year
by
year
to
feel
their
fulness
but
increase
the
law
of
nature
is
to
give
to
give
to
give
and
to
rejoice
in
giving
with
a
generous
voice
and
so
trust
god
and
truly
live
but
see
this
miser
at
the
last
this
man
who
loves
grasps
hold
of
gold
who
grasps
it
with
such
eager
hold
to
hold
forever
hard
and
fast
as
if
to
hold
what
god
lets
go
as
if
to
hold
while
all
around
lets
go
and
drops
upon
the
ground
all
things
as
generous
as
snow
let
go
your
greedy
hold
i
say
let
go
your
hold
do
not
refuse
death
comes
by
and
shakes
you
loose
and
sends
you
shamed
upon
your
way
what
if
the
sun
should
keep
his
gold
the
rich
moon
lock
her
silver
up
what
if
the
buttercup
became
a
miser
mean
and
old
ah
me
the
coffins
are
so
true
in
all
accounts
the
shrouds
so
thin
that
down
there
you
might
sew
and
sew
nor
ever
sew
one
pocket
in
and
all
that
you
can
hold
of
lands
down
there
below
the
grass
down
there
will
only
be
that
little
share
you
hold
in
your
two
hands
xii
she
comes
she
comes
the
stony
floor
speaks
out
and
now
the
rusty
door
at
last
has
just
one
word
this
day
with
mute
religious
lips
to
say
she
comes
she
comes
and
lo
her
face
is
upward
radiant
fair
as
prayer
so
pure
here
in
this
holy
place
where
holy
peace
is
everywhere
her
upraised
face
her
face
of
light
and
loveliness
from
duty
done
is
like
a
rising
orient
sun
that
pushes
back
the
brow
of
night
how
brave
how
beautiful
is
truth
good
deeds
untold
are
like
to
this
but
fairest
of
all
fair
things
is
a
pious
maiden
in
her
youth
a
pious
maiden
as
she
stands
just
on
the
threshold
of
the
years
that
throb
and
pulse
with
hopes
and
fears
and
reaches
god
her
helpless
hands
how
fair
is
she
how
fond
is
she
her
foot
upon
the
threshold
there
her
breath
is
as
a
blossomed
tree
this
maiden
mantled
in
her
hair
her
hair
her
black
abundant
hair
where
night
inhabited
all
night
and
all
this
day
will
not
take
flight
but
finds
content
and
houses
there
her
hands
are
clasped
her
two
small
hands
they
hold
the
holy
book
of
prayer
just
as
she
steps
the
threshold
there
clasped
downward
where
she
silent
stands
xiii
once
more
she
lifts
her
lowly
face
and
slowly
lifts
her
large
dark
eyes
of
wonder
and
in
still
surprise
she
looks
full
forward
in
her
place
she
looks
full
forward
on
the
air
above
the
tomb
and
yet
below
the
fruits
of
gold
the
blooms
of
snow
as
looking
looking
anywhere
she
feels
she
knows
not
what
she
feels
it
is
not
terror
is
not
fear
but
there
is
something
that
reveals
a
presence
that
is
near
and
dear
she
does
not
let
her
eyes
fall
down
they
lift
against
the
far
profound
against
the
blue
above
the
town
two
vultures
circle
round
two
brown
birds
swim
above
the
sea
her
large
eyes
swim
as
dreamily
and
follow
far
and
follow
high
two
circling
black
specks
in
the
sky
one
forward
step
the
closing
door
creaks
out
as
frightened
or
in
pain
her
eyes
are
on
the
ground
again
two
men
are
standing
close
before
my
love
sighs
one
my
life
my
all
her
lifted
foot
across
the
sill
sinks
down
and
all
things
are
so
still
you
hear
the
orange
blossoms
fall
but
fear
comes
not
where
duty
is
and
purity
is
peace
and
rest
her
cross
is
close
upon
her
breast
her
two
hands
clasp
hard
hold
of
this
her
two
hands
clasp
cross
book
and
she
is
strong
in
tranquil
purity
ay
strong
as
samson
when
he
laid
his
two
hands
forth
and
bowed
and
prayed
one
at
her
left
one
at
her
right
and
she
between
the
steps
upon
i
can
but
see
that
syrian
night
the
women
there
at
early
dawn
is
strange
i
know
and
may
be
wrong
but
ever
pictured
in
my
song
and
rhyming
on
i
see
the
day
they
came
to
roll
the
stone
away
xiv
the
sky
is
like
an
opal
sea
the
air
is
like
the
breath
of
kine
but
oh
her
face
is
white
and
she
leans
faint
to
see
a
lifted
sign
to
see
two
hands
lift
up
and
wave
to
see
a
face
so
white
with
woe
so
ghastly
hollow
white
as
though
it
had
that
moment
left
the
grave
her
sweet
face
at
that
ghostly
sign
her
fair
face
in
her
weight
of
hair
is
like
a
white
dove
drowning
there
a
white
dove
drowned
in
tuscan
wine
he
tries
to
stand
to
stand
erect
is
gold
is
gold
that
holds
him
down
and
soul
and
body
both
must
drown
two
millstones
tied
about
his
neck
now
once
again
his
piteous
face
is
raised
to
her
face
reaching
there
he
prays
such
piteous
silent
prayer
as
prays
a
dying
man
for
grace
it
is
not
good
to
see
him
strain
to
lift
his
hands
to
gasp
to
try
to
speak
his
parched
lips
are
so
dry
their
sight
is
as
a
living
pain
i
think
that
rich
man
down
in
hell
some
like
this
old
man
with
his
gold
to
gasp
and
gasp
perpetual
like
to
this
minute
i
have
told
xv
at
last
the
miser
cries
his
pain
a
shrill
wild
cry
as
if
a
grave
just
ope
its
stony
lips
and
gave
one
sentence
forth
then
closed
again
was
twenty
years
last
night
last
night
his
lips
still
moved
but
not
to
speak
his
outstretched
hands
so
trembling
weak
were
beggar
hands
in
sorry
plight
his
face
upturned
to
hers
his
lips
kept
talking
on
but
gave
no
sound
his
feet
were
cloven
to
the
ground
like
iron
hooks
his
ay
twenty
years
she
sadly
sighed
i
promised
mother
every
year
that
i
would
pray
for
father
here
as
she
had
prayed
the
night
she
died
to
pray
as
she
prayed
fervidly
as
she
had
promised
she
would
pray
the
sad
night
of
her
marriage
day
for
him
wherever
he
might
be
then
she
was
still
then
sudden
she
let
fall
her
eyes
and
so
outspake
as
if
her
very
heart
would
break
her
proud
lips
trembling
piteously
and
whether
he
come
soon
or
late
to
kneel
beside
this
nameless
grave
may
god
forgive
my
father
hate
as
i
forgive
as
she
forgave
he
saw
the
stone
he
understood
with
that
quick
knowledge
that
will
come
most
quick
when
men
are
made
most
dumb
with
terror
that
stops
still
the
blood
and
then
a
blindness
slowly
fell
on
soul
and
body
but
his
hands
held
tight
his
bags
two
iron
bands
as
if
to
bear
them
into
hell
he
sank
upon
the
nameless
stone
with
oh
such
sad
such
piteous
moan
as
never
man
might
seek
to
know
from
man
most
unforgiving
foe
he
sighed
at
last
so
long
so
deep
as
one
heart
breaking
in
one
sleep
one
long
last
weary
willing
sigh
as
if
it
were
a
grace
to
die
and
then
his
hands
like
loosened
bands
hung
down
hung
down
on
either
side
his
hands
hung
down
and
opened
wide
he
rested
