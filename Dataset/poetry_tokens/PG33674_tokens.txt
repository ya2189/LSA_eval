dear
cornwall
the
allied
cause
crumbling
away
it
is
high
time
we
thought
of
aesthetics
as
a
triste
jest
i
said
that
to
you
the
other
day
and
your
reply
was
a
plea
to
let
you
write
a
preface
for
a
new
edition
of
my
forgotten
sonnets
from
the
patagonian
i
am
at
last
persuaded
and
who
but
you
should
do
the
preface
mitteleuropa
a
fact
it
should
be
apparent
to
any
honest
thinking
man
that
we
are
losing
the
war
perhaps
in
a
larger
sense
we
have
already
lost
the
war
and
the
dusk
of
the
is
come
then
we
are
at
last
joined
with
the
héllenes
and
latins
in
the
descending
scale
and
it
is
the
teuton
now
approaching
the
perihelion
with
the
slav
yet
to
conquer
in
the
far
distance
but
that
is
an
for
eternity
and
we
have
merely
to
do
with
the
finite
present
so
we
may
still
think
of
resistance
and
not
yet
abandon
hope
of
postponing
is
now
the
hour
for
the
supreme
test
of
america
and
she
too
must
fail
as
our
allies
have
failed
before
the
huns
unless
somewhere
she
can
find
the
beauty
and
the
strength
of
the
human
soul
with
which
to
give
battle
for
the
first
time
in
history
it
is
souls
not
guns
that
will
win
the
war
and
remember
my
dear
friend
that
beauty
is
more
necessary
than
food
that
the
soul
may
are
all
but
engulfed
in
error
we
say
that
we
do
not
hate
the
german
people
it
is
the
kaiser
we
are
fighting
a
pitiful
it
must
be
the
german
people
we
hate
as
an
overshadowing
race
if
our
fight
is
to
have
even
the
excuse
of
the
inflamed
passion
of
the
survival
of
the
fittest
we
must
acknowledge
the
kaiser
as
the
symbol
of
the
best
organized
form
of
government
unless
we
are
frankly
anarchists
the
most
efficient
the
most
powerful
the
most
nearly
approaching
a
practical
socialism
let
us
therefore
start
afresh
we
hate
the
german
people
for
they
have
threatened
our
complacent
supremacy
as
lords
of
the
world
now
we
are
at
least
far
the
allies
have
failed
signally
as
a
military
force
the
europeans
have
forgotten
how
to
fight
and
we
in
america
have
never
learned
we
have
put
too
much
faith
in
materialism
and
betrayed
the
soul
and
beauty
there
is
more
to
life
than
living
and
more
to
an
army
than
arms
the
moment
is
here
that
demands
we
scrap
the
military
leaders
as
such
and
seek
stronger
why
not
then
turn
to
the
poets
to
direct
the
war
for
lo
it
was
the
poets
who
in
seven
days
won
the
irish
revolution
none
knows
better
than
you
how
i
begrudge
giving
the
west
britons
any
praise
any
glory
but
there
is
the
simple
truth
they
vanquished
the
foe
because
they
first
had
conquered
fear
and
then
nought
could
stand
against
we
could
purge
ourselves
of
our
fear
of
germany
we
should
capture
berlin
could
i
enlist
a
battalion
of
irreproachables
whose
uniforms
should
be
walking
suit
top
hat
and
pumps
and
their
only
weapon
an
ebony
stick
and
sail
tomorrow
we
should
march
down
unter
den
linden
in
a
month
provided
wrapped
in
our
kerchiefs
we
carried
the
gospel
of
beauty
and
a
nonchalance
in
the
knot
of
our
verily
men
are
killed
solely
because
they
fear
death
and
turn
their
backs
on
beauty
for
only
ugliness
and
error
can
destroy
and
ugliness
in
the
end
destroys
is
really
no
horror
in
the
war
even
in
the
ridiculous
way
we
are
now
fighting
it
is
all
a
shabby
stupid
sham
that
chap
griffith
gave
us
a
more
realistic
spectacle
in
the
birth
of
a
nation
far
too
few
men
are
actually
killed
and
wounded
and
the
job
is
much
too
large
for
the
materialists
they
do
not
know
how
to
employ
effectively
the
huge
forces
they
have
raised
into
somehow
we
can
grope
our
way
back
to
the
springs
of
beauty
all
may
yet
be
saved
but
it
will
require
the
sacrifice
of
everything
we
have
for
myriads
it
will
mean
the
offering
of
their
lives
for
that
is
all
they
possess
and
it
must
be
done
freely
gladly
with
their
souls
purified
if
it
is
to
avail
anything
pride
ambition
selfishness
must
go
or
we
perish
blind
myself
you
know
i
am
willingly
in
service
as
a
common
soldier
although
some
years
beyond
conscription
age
ungrudgingly
i
gave
up
alcohol
almost
a
lifelong
necessity
and
for
months
i
the
epicurean
have
been
dispassionately
measuring
the
supposed
hardships
of
war
that
i
might
truly
understand
what
a
soldier
has
to
undergo
with
beauty
in
the
bloodbeat
privation
is
nothing
what
can
touch
me
now
except
the
amusing
joy
of
giving
up
for
the
common
good
yet
who
actually
loves
humankind
less
than
i
but
the
subordination
idea
intrigues
me
possesses
me
satisfies
me
how
better
can
i
prove
my
patent
of
snobbery
and
my
innate
right
cordially
to
dislike
my
fellowmen
social
degradation
involved
in
functioning
as
an
enlisted
man
was
and
of
course
is
the
worst
of
the
annoyances
i
am
neither
young
enough
nor
sufficiently
democratic
to
enjoy
day
after
day
a
status
it
is
a
trial
i
confess
but
i
venture
to
persuade
myself
that
i
do
all
that
is
required
of
me
with
admirable
abasement
and
detachment
occasionally
indeed
it
is
capital
fun
to
play
the
anonymous
cipher
i
am
often
urged
to
obtain
a
commission
but
i
can
not
quite
do
that
for
would
not
that
be
a
confession
that
i
had
the
pluck
to
stick
it
out
i
must
remain
as
i
am
many
of
my
contemporaries
are
finding
the
khaki
an
easy
means
of
increasing
their
literary
reputations
wise
brothers
ye
have
chosen
your
rôles
i
prefer
you
have
seen
my
book
through
the
press
i
may
be
dead
with
all
my
heart
i
hope
i
shall
not
come
back
for
then
impersonally
i
shall
have
fallen
for
a
cause
in
which
i
have
no
faith
what
more
distinguished
end
for
an
incurable
poseur
have
i
not
been
called
that
plant
i
beg
you
mignonette
to
encircle
my
arrowroot
has
all
this
to
do
with
the
sonnets
from
the
patagonian
if
you
will
read
my
words
aright
they
will
give
the
key
to
my
poems
should
you
my
beloved
hollis
still
lack
a
key
the
volume
when
it
first
appeared
was
not
liked
by
divers
nice
people
it
was
thought
nasty
but
none
put
it
down
till
he
had
finished
it
a
terror
was
on
him
lest
he
miss
a
word
and
the
terror
was
the
sword
of
beauty
which
slayeth
all
intrepidity
you
shall
interpret

taking

with
her
there
was
no
joy
left
in
the

and
life
was
but
an
orchid
that
was
dead
even
our
pious
peacocks
went
unfed
i
had
deserved
no
treachery
like
this
for
i
had
bitten
sharp
kiss
after
kiss
devoutly
till
her
sleek
young
body
bled
then
carlo
came
he
shone
like
a
new
sin
straightway
i
knew
still
was
sweet
and
that
my
bleeding
heart
would
not
be
scarred
i
sought
a
shop
where
shoes
were
sold
within
and
for
three
hundred
francs
made
brave
my
feet
and
then
i
danced
along
the

in
the

gay
and
audacious
crime
glints
in
his
eyes
and
his

talk
raping
the
commonplace
gleefully
runs
a
race
and
none
can
ever
follow
where
he
flies
he
streaks
himself
with
vices
tenderly
he
cradles
sin
and
with
a
figleaf
fan
taps
his
green
cat
watching
a
bored
sun
span
the
wasted
minutes
to
eternity
once
i
took
up
his
trail
along
the
dark
wishful
to
track
him
to
the
witches
flame
to
see
the
bubbling
of
the
sneer
and
snare
the
way
led
through
a
fragrant
starlit
park
and
soon
upon
a
harlot
house
i
came
within
i
found
him
playing
at
solitaire
en
monocle
born
with
a
monocle
he
stares
at
life
and
sends
his
soul
on
pensive
promenades
he
pays
a
high
price
for
discarded
gods
and
then
regilds
them
to
renew
their
strife
his
calm
moustache
points
to
the
ironies
and
a
laugh
sucks
in
the
night
full
of
the
riant
mists
that
turn
to
white

lost
battles
with
banalities
masters

and
a
path
to
tread
for

that
are

for
the
air
features
are
fixtures
when
the
face
is
fled
and
we
are
left
the
husks
of
tarnished
hair

lusts
uncomforted

donovan
loving

her
flesh
was
lyrical
and
sweet
to
flog
for
the
whip
blanched
her
blood
though
every
vein
flooded
with
hate
shot
a
hot
flow
of
pain
and
her
screams
were
muffled
by
a
brackish
fog
he
loved
her
yet
his
passion
could
but
fret
unless
he
lashed
her
to
an
awkward
rage
but
when
his
hand
wrote
terror
on
her
page
he
knew
exultant
joy
of
feigned
regret
theirs
was
a
bond
that
poured
the
wine
of
fear
and
he
drained
her
stiffened
limbs
with
cruel
art
he
taught
her
that
all
tenderness
had
fled
till
she
would
beg
the
hurt
to
taste
the
tear
and
when
she
bent
to
kiss
her
quivering
heart
it
lit
a
chinese
candle
in
his
head
portrait

she
was
tired
to
tears
and
yet
there
were
no
tears
only
the
dead
seas
of
indifference
meeting
the
languors
of
a
nerveless
sense
for
she
had
played
the
rôles
for
twenty
years
the
queen
called
for
her
satins
while
the
drab
demanded
love
and
the
wild
hunger
tore
the
woman
raged
to
touch
the
flame
once
more
but
the
emotions
could
not
stab
there
were
the
thousand
parts
she
had
essayed
and
the
three
thousand
gowns
that
she
had
worn
into
the
ragbag
each
frock
found
its
flight
crumpled
and
ravished
of
a
shade
and
every
script
is
wandering
forlorn
gnawed
by
the
mirage
of
an
opening
night
portrait
in

hugh
failure
at
forty
he
saw
there
was
no
choice
to
left
or
right
time
that
had
marked
him
for
the
least
of
sages
pointed
the
hour
and
several
blotted
pages
stood
witness
to
the
struggle
in
the
night
behind
him
lay
a
happiness
that
might
have
made
him
shine
a
figure
through
the
ages
before
him
loomed
a
toiling
at
mean
wages
alternative
to
sinking
out
of
sight
this
much
was
sure
he
never
need
retrace
the
leagues
that
he
had
travelled
were
an
ending
there
wound
no
footpath
to
a
sunlit
place
where
he
might
nurse
his
dreams

peace

portrait

and

lady
enid
aspens
at
cresheim
she
had
become
a
stranger
suddenly
just
as
all
men
were
strangers
then
he
knew
why
she
must
be
an
alien
even
she
since
there
was
nought
her
human
love
could
do
to
give
him
the
last
access
to
her
soul
returning
came
his
years
as
wholly
vain
repeated
payment
of
inutile
toll
to
reach
a
shrine
he
would
not
seek
again
it
scarcely
left
him
sad
to
find
how
wrong
had
been
his
vision
of
won
womanhood
this
yearning
ache
that
he
had
held
so
long
for
a
full
mingling
of
their
separate
blood
freed
solitary
now
with
unscared
eyes

gives
a
fool
an
ear
of
corn
from
the
blind
red
sunburnt
earth
blandly
lies
in
the
sun
divinely
green
disowning
what
the
earth
and
sun
have
done
kisses
and
corn
and
a
pool
to
crown
the
birth
with
once
to
come

portraits
of
mabel
dodge
louis
her
smile
her
hidden
smile
was
full
of
little
breasts
and
with
her
too
white
hands
she
stroked
her
fears
the
while
the
serpent
peered
at
her
arched
ears
and
night
grim
hours
stalked
in
unbidden
guests
a
noise
was
in
her
eyes
that
sang
of
scorn
and
round
her
voice
there
gleamed
a
nameless
dread
as
though
her
lips
were
hungry
for
the
dead
yet
knew
the
food
of
dawn
would
be
forlorn
the
cold
hours
ebbed
and
still
she
held
her
throne
across
the
sky
the
lightning
made
mad
play
and
then
the
scarlet
screams
stood
forth
revealed
she
turned
her
back
and
grasped
a
monotone
it
answered
all
she
lived
again
that
day
she
triumphed
in
the
tragic
turnip
field
the
last
dance
at
dawn
and
she
was
sad
since
she
could
not
be
sad
and
every
star
fled
amorous
from
the
sky
her
pampered
knees
fell
under
her
keen
eye
and
it
came
to
her
she
would
not
go
mad
the
gaucheries
were
turning
the
last
screw
but
there
was
still
the
island
in
the
sea
the
harridan
chorus
of
eternity
that
let
her
smile
because
he
saw
she
knew
she
even
dared
be
impudent
again
and
bit
his
ear
the
deaths
were
far
away
a
black
mass
sounded
from
the
treasure
vaults
she
tried
to
rouge
her
heart
yet
quite
in
vain
the
crucifix
danced
in
beribboned
gay
and
lisped
to
her
a
wish
for
the
next
waltz

carl

gertrude
in
the
gentlemanly
interest
he
polished
snubs
till
they
were
regnant
art
curling
their
shameless
toilets
round
the
hour
each
lay
upon
his
lips
an
exquisite
flower
subtly
malign
and
poisoned
for
its
part
the
path
of
victims
was
no
wanton
plan
he
had
bowed
his
head
in
sorrow
at
his
birth
for
he
had
said
long
ere
he
came
to
earth
that
it
was
no
place
for
a
gentleman
but
always
a
lurked
behind
the
screen
and
somehow
he
missed
the
ultimate
degrees
he
saw
a
beggar
at
the
daylight
fall
and
then
he
rose
and
robbed
him
for
the
scene
and
when
they
called
him
cad
he
found
release
he
felt
he
had
used
the
finest
snub
of
all
portraits
of
louise
norton
donald
buveuse
her
voice
was
and
immaculate
and
like
peach
blossoms
blown
across
the
wind
her
white
words
made
the
hour
seem
cool
and
kind
hung
with
soft
dawns
that
danced
a
shadow
fete
a
silken
silence
crept
up
from
the
south
the
flutes
were
hushed
that
mimed
the
orange
moon
and
down
the
willow
stream
my
sighs
were
strewn
while
i
knelt
to
the
corners
of
her
mouth
lead
me
afar
from
clamorous
dissonance
for
i
am
sick
of
empty
trumpetings
choking
the
highways
with
a
dusty
noise
here
i
have
found
her
sweet
sheer
utterance
and
now
i
seek
the
garden
of
the
wings
where
i
may
bathe
in
sounds
that
life
destroys
extreme
unction
across
the
rotting
pads
in
the
lily
lake
her
gesture
floated
toward
the
iris
bed
wrapped
in
a
whispered
perfume
of
the
dead
and
her
gaze
followed
slowly
in
its
wake
now
was
the
summons
come
she
must
obey
for
beauty
pleaded
from
the
charnel
house
for
violet
nights
and
violent
carouse
to
free
her
from
the
cerements
of
decay
crapulous
hands
reach
out
to
strangle
thee
and
every
moment
is
a
with
bats
to
chant
corruption
litany
be
thou
a
torch
to
flash
fanfaronade
and
as
the
earth
crumbles
beneath
thy
feet
flaunt
thou
the
glitter
of
a
new
brocade
the
jade
vase
he
had
hunted
for
it
to
the
alley
end
yet
when
he
found
the
jade
vase
he
was
sad
with
ennui
for
the
praise
he
had
poured
into
bowls
that
merely
did
not
offend
a
wall
of
glass
held
back
his
worshipping
and
his
eyes
that
drank
this
miracle
of
stone
acknowledged
the
discovery
not
his
own
still
the
vase
was
there
and
that
was
everything
he
thought
back
over
all
the
songs
he
had
sung
and
all
the
hours
his
heart
like
waving
grain
had
swayed
to
music
and
the
joys
now
dead
seemed
haunting
coins
to
meagre
beauty
flung
poignantly
he
longed
to
call
them
back
in
vain
but
they
were
the
last
words
that
the
poet
said
portraits
of
the
author
cornwall
epicede
wistfully
shimmering
shamelessly
wise
and
weak
he
lives
in
pawn
pledging
a
battered
name
he
loves
his
failures
as
one
might
love
fame
and
listens
for
the
ghost
years
as
they
speak
a
fragrance
bright
and
broken
clasps
his
head
and
wildwood
airs
sing
a
frayed
interlude
while
cloaked
he
comes
in
a
new
attitude
to
play
gravedigger
if
the
word
be
said
he
swore
he
would
be
glad
and
only
glad
and
turned
to
broadway
for
the
peace
of
god
he
found
it
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
for
where
the
dregs
lay
it
was
less
than
sad
and
mid
the
murmur
when
the
dance
was
trod
he
heard
the
echo
of
a
genius
pass
in
the
falklands
for
his
soul
when
homeless
then
is
at
home
and
in
a
paradise
where
shadows
wane
he
draws
droll
figures
on
the
windowpane
to
lure
his
vagrom
fellow
souls
to
rome
there
is
a
potent
rancour
in
the
moon
hunting
for
those
who
love
him
still
three
gleam
back
but
with
detached
anxiety
he
vows
that
he
will
alienate
them
soon
he
said
that
love
had
but
two
words
the
last
and
first
and
joy
in
flying
laces
lay
he
watched
each
kiss
to
kill
it
at
stark
ease
his
strangler
hands
carve
prayers
for
the
past
and
chastely
he
spends
an
hour
every
day
erecting
tombstones
to
carnalities
the
noon
of
night
the
fictive
tear
he
holds
in
reverence
and
studies
heady
griefs
that
wash
the
cheek
it
is
a
dim
dominion
he
must
seek
to
gain
some
raiment
for
his
impotence
sorrows
are
numbered
the
sighs
have
their
strings
and
barren
smiles
are
trained
for
tragedy
he
ties
up
parcels
of
mock
gaiety
and
labels
them
with
many
worshippings
grapes
in
the
grass
and
every
day
a
waste
at
scattered
sources
of
lost
loveliness
with
drunkenness
to
drain
the
ruined
seats
he
knows
his
gems
are
turned
to
glassy
paste
but
he
thanks
god
aloof
from
all
distress
for
he
knows
sewers
run
beneath
the
city
streets
fifth
avenue
and
when
discovery
marred
the
best
disguise
he
winced
a
sigh
bowed
to
a
spoiled
deceit
and
donned
the
damask
draperies
of
defeat
to
woo
dishonour
as
an
enterprise
his
had
its
tenderness
and
reared
an
outland
refuge
for
his
pride
for
all
were
baffled
telling
how
he
lied
since
more
than
any
guessed
he
would
confess
he
died
a
hero
in
fifth
avenue
one
yellowed
day
saving
a
tattered
man
but
in
the
litter
of
his
passing
breath
a
prayer
lay
lest
one
should
misconstrue
it
was
an
accident
and
he
began
a
last
profound
apology
to
death
