the
complete

edgar

poe
edited
by
john
ingram
preface
in
placing
before
the
public
this
collection
of
edgar
poe
poetical
works
it
is
requisite
to
point
out
in
what
respects
it
differs
from
and
is
superior
to
the
numerous
collections
which
have
preceded
it
until
recently
all
editions
whether
american
or
english
of
poems
have
been
reprints
of
the
first
posthumous
collection
published
at
new
york
in
in
i
began
drawing
attention
to
the
fact
that
unknown
and
unreprinted
poetry
by
edgar
poe
was
in
existence
most
if
not
all
of
the
specimens
issued
in
my
articles
have
since
been
reprinted
by
different
editors
and
publishers
but
the
present
is
the
first
occasion
on
which
all
the
pieces
referred
to
have
been
garnered
into
one
sheaf
besides
the
poems
thus
alluded
to
this
volume
will
be
found
to
contain
many
additional
pieces
and
extra
stanzas
nowhere
else
published
or
included
in
poe
works
such
verses
have
been
gathered
from
printed
or
manuscript
sources
during
a
research
extending
over
many
years
in
addition
to
the
new
poetical
matter
included
in
this
volume
attention
should
also
be
solicited
on
behalf
of
the
notes
which
will
be
found
to
contain
much
matter
interesting
both
from
biographical
and
bibliographical
points

memoir
of
edgar
allan
poe
during
the
last
few
years
every
incident
in
the
life
of
edgar
poe
has
been
subjected
to
microscopic
investigation
the
result
has
not
been
altogether
satisfactory
on
the
one
hand
envy
and
prejudice
have
magnified
every
blemish
of
his
character
into
crime
whilst
on
the
other
blind
admiration
would
depict
him
as
far
too
good
for
human
nature
daily
food
let
us
endeavor
to
judge
him
impartially
granting
that
he
was
as
a
mortal
subject
to
the
ordinary
weaknesses
of
mortality
but
that
he
was
tempted
sorely
treated
badly
and
suffered
deeply
the
poet
ancestry
and
parentage
are
chiefly
interesting
as
explaining
some
of
the
complexities
of
his
character
his
father
david
poe
was
of
extraction
educated
for
the
bar
he
elected
to
abandon
it
for
the
stage
in
one
of
his
tours
through
the
chief
towns
of
the
united
states
he
met
and
married
a
young
actress
elizabeth
arnold
member
of
an
english
family
distinguished
for
its
musical
talents
as
an
actress
elizabeth
poe
acquired
some
reputation
but
became
even
better
known
for
her
domestic
virtues
in
those
days
the
united
states
afforded
little
scope
for
dramatic
energy
so
it
is
not
surprising
to
find
that
when
her
husband
died
after
a
few
years
of
married
life
the
young
widow
had
a
vain
struggle
to
maintain
herself
and
three
little
ones
william
henry
edgar
and
rosalie
before
her
premature
death
in
december
the
poet
mother
had
been
reduced
to
the
dire
necessity
of
living
on
the
charity
of
her
neighbors
edgar
the
second
child
of
david
and
elizabeth
poe
was
born
at
boston
in
the
united
states
on
the
of
january
upon
his
death
at
richmond
virginia
edgar
was
adopted
by
a
wealthy
scotch
merchant
john
allan
allan
who
had
married
an
american
lady
and
settled
in
virginia
was
childless
he
therefore
took
naturally
to
the
brilliant
and
beautiful
little
boy
treated
him
as
his
son
and
made
him
take
his
own
surname
edgar
allan
as
he
was
now
styled
after
some
elementary
tuition
in
richmond
was
taken
to
england
by
his
adopted
parents
and
in
placed
at
the
manor
house
school
under
the
rev
bransby
the
future
poet
spent
a
lustrum
of
his
life
neither
unprofitably
nor
apparently
ungenially
bransby
who
is
himself
so
quaintly
portrayed
in
poe
tale
of
wilson
described
edgar
allan
by
which
name
only
he
knew
the
lad
as
a
quick
and
clever
boy
who
would
have
been
a
very
good
boy
had
he
not
been
spoilt
by
his
parents
meaning
of
course
the
allans
they
allowed
him
an
extravagant
amount
of
which
enabled
him
to
get
into
all
manner
of
mischief
still
i
liked
the
boy
added
the
tutor
but
poor
fellow
his
parents
spoiled
him
poe
has
described
some
aspects
of
his
school
days
in
his
oft
cited
story
of
wilson
probably
there
is
the
usual
amount
of
poetic
exaggeration
in
these
reminiscences
but
they
are
almost
the
only
record
we
have
of
that
portion
of
his
career
and
therefore
apart
from
their
literary
merits
are
on
that
account
deeply
interesting
the
description
of
the
sleepy
old
london
suburb
as
it
was
in
those
days
is
remarkably
accurate
but
the
revisions
which
the
story
of
wilson
went
through
before
it
reached
its
present
perfect
state
caused
many
of
the
author
details
to
deviate
widely
from
their
original
correctness
his
schoolhouse
in
the
earliest
draft
was
truthfully
described
as
an
old
irregular
and
dwelling
and
so
it
remained
until
its
destruction
a
few
years
ago
the
william
wilson
referring
to
those
bygone
happy
days
spent
in
the
english
academy
says
the
teeming
brain
of
childhood
requires
no
external
world
of
incident
to
occupy
or
amuse
it
the
morning
awakening
the
nightly
summons
to
bed
the
connings
the
recitations
the
periodical
and
perambulations
the
playground
with
its
broils
its
pastimes
its
intrigues
these
by
a
mental
sorcery
long
forgotten
were
made
to
involve
a
wilderness
of
sensation
a
world
of
rich
incident
a
universe
of
varied
emotion
of
excitement
the
most
passionate
and
le
bon
temps
que
ce
siècle
de
fer
from
this
world
of
boyish
imagination
poe
was
called
to
his
adopted
parents
home
in
the
united
states
he
returned
to
america
in
and
was
speedily
placed
in
an
academy
in
richmond
virginia
in
which
city
the
allans
continued
to
reside
already
well
grounded
in
the
elementary
processes
of
education
not
without
reputation
on
account
of
his
european
residence
handsome
proud
and
regarded
as
the
heir
of
a
wealthy
man
poe
must
have
been
looked
up
to
with
no
little
respect
by
his
fellow
pupils
he
speedily
made
himself
a
prominent
position
in
the
school
not
only
by
his
classical
attainments
but
by
his
athletic
feats
accomplishments
calculated
to
render
him
a
leader
among
lads
in
the
simple
school
athletics
of
those
days
when
a
gymnasium
had
not
been
heard
of
he
was
princeps
is
the
reminiscence
of
his
fellow
pupil
colonel
preston
poe
he
remembers
as
a
swift
runner
a
wonderful
leaper
and
what
was
more
rare
a
boxer
with
some
slight
training
he
would
allow
the
strongest
boy
in
the
school
to
strike
him
with
full
force
in
the
chest
he
taught
me
the
secret
and
i
imitated
him
after
my
measure
it
was
to
inflate
the
lungs
to
the
uttermost
and
at
the
moment
of
receiving
the
blow
to
exhale
the
air
it
looked
surprising
and
was
indeed
a
little
rough
but
with
a
good
and
some
resolution
it
was
not
difficult
to
stand
it
for
swimming
he
was
noted
being
in
many
of
his
athletic
proclivities
surprisingly
like
byron
in
his
youth
in
one
of
his
feats
poe
only
came
off
second
best
a
challenge
to
a
foot
race
says
colonel
preston
had
been
passed
between
the
two
classical
schools
of
the
city
we
selected
poe
as
our
champion
the
race
came
off
one
bright
may
morning
at
sunrise
in
the
capitol
square
historical
truth
compels
me
to
add
that
on
this
occasion
our
school
was
beaten
and
we
had
to
pay
up
our
small
bets
poe
ran
well
but
his
competitor
was
a
fellow
who
would
have
outstripped
atalanta
without
the
help
of
the
golden
apples
in
our
latin
exercises
in
school
continues
the
colonel
poe
was
among
the
first
not
first
without
dispute
we
had
competitors
who
fairly
disputed
the
palm
especially
one
nat
howard
afterwards
known
as
one
of
the
ripest
scholars
in
virginia
and
distinguished
also
as
a
profound
lawyer
if
howard
was
less
brilliant
than
poe
he
was
far
more
studious
for
even
then
the
germs
of
waywardness
were
developing
in
the
nascent
poet
and
even
then
no
inconsiderable
portion
of
his
time
was
given
to
versifying
but
if
i
put
howard
as
a
latinist
on
a
level
with
poe
i
do
him
full
justice
poe
says
the
colonel
was
very
fond
of
the
odes
of
horace
and
repeated
them
so
often
in
my
hearing
that
i
learned
by
sound
the
words
of
many
before
i
understood
their
meaning
in
the
lilting
rhythm
of
the
sapphics
and
iambics
his
ear
as
yet
untutored
in
more
complicated
harmonies
took
special
delight
two
odes
in
particular
have
been
humming
in
my
ear
all
my
life
since
set
to
the
tune
of
his
recitation
satis
terris
nivis
atque
dirce
grandinis
misit
pater
et
rubente
and
ebur
neque
aureum
mea
renidet
in
dono
lacu
ar
etc
i
remember
that
poe
was
also
a
very
fine
french
scholar
yet
with
all
his
superiorities
he
was
not
the
master
spirit
nor
even
the
favorite
of
the
school
i
assign
from
my
recollection
this
place
to
howard
poe
as
i
recall
my
impressions
now
was
capricious
inclined
to
be
imperious
and
though
of
generous
impulses
not
steadily
kind
nor
even
amiable
and
so
what
he
would
exact
was
refused
to
him
i
add
another
thing
which
had
its
influence
i
am
sure
at
the
time
of
which
i
speak
richmond
was
one
of
the
most
aristocratic
cities
on
this
side
of
the
atlantic
a
school
is
of
its
nature
democratic
but
still
boys
will
unconsciously
bear
about
the
odor
of
their
fathers
notions
good
or
bad
of
edgar
poe
who
had
then
resumed
his
parental
cognomen
it
was
known
that
his
parents
had
been
players
and
that
he
was
dependent
upon
the
bounty
that
is
bestowed
upon
an
adopted
son
all
this
had
the
effect
of
making
the
boys
decline
his
leadership
and
on
looking
back
on
it
since
i
fancy
it
gave
him
a
fierceness
he
would
otherwise
not
have
had
this
last
paragraph
of
colonel
preston
recollections
cast
a
suggestive
light
upon
the
causes
which
rendered
unhappy
the
lad
early
life
and
tended
to
blight
his
prospective
hopes
although
mixing
with
members
of
the
best
families
of
the
province
and
naturally
endowed
with
hereditary
and
native
pride
fostered
by
the
indulgence
of
wealth
and
the
consciousness
of
intellectual
superiority
edgar
poe
was
made
to
feel
that
his
parentage
was
obscure
and
that
he
himself
was
dependent
upon
the
charity
and
caprice
of
an
alien
by
blood
for
many
lads
these
things
would
have
had
but
little
meaning
but
to
one
of
poe
proud
temperament
it
must
have
been
a
source
of
constant
torment
and
all
allusions
to
it
gall
and
wormwood
and
allan
was
not
the
man
to
wean
poe
from
such
festering
fancies
as
a
rule
he
was
proud
of
the
handsome
and
talented
boy
and
indulged
him
in
all
that
wealth
could
purchase
but
at
other
times
he
treated
him
with
contumely
and
made
him
feel
the
bitterness
of
his
position
still
poe
did
maintain
his
leading
position
among
the
scholars
at
that
virginian
academy
and
several
still
living
have
favored
us
with
reminiscences
of
him
his
feats
in
swimming
to
which
colonel
preston
has
alluded
are
quite
a
feature
of
his
youthful
career
colonel
mayo
records
one
daring
performance
in
natation
which
is
thoroughly
characteristic
of
the
lad
one
day
in
when
standing
on
the
banks
of
the
james
river
poe
dared
his
comrade
into
jumping
in
in
order
to
swim
to
a
certain
point
with
him
after
floundering
about
in
the
nearly
frozen
stream
for
some
time
they
reached
the
piles
upon
which
mayo
bridge
was
then
supported
and
there
attempted
to
rest
and
try
to
gain
the
shore
by
climbing
up
the
log
abutment
to
the
bridge
upon
reaching
the
bridge
however
they
were
dismayed
to
find
that
its
plank
flooring
overlapped
the
abutment
by
several
feet
and
that
it
was
impossible
to
ascend
it
nothing
remained
for
them
but
to
let
go
their
slippery
hold
and
swim
back
to
the
shore
poe
reached
the
bank
in
an
exhausted
and
benumbed
condition
whilst
mayo
was
rescued
by
a
boat
just
as
he
was
succumbing
on
getting
ashore
poe
was
seized
with
a
violent
attack
of
vomiting
and
both
lads
were
ill
for
several
weeks
alluding
to
another
quite
famous
swimming
feat
of
his
own
the
poet
remarked
any
in
the
falls
in
my
days
would
have
swum
the
hellespont
and
thought
nothing
of
the
matter
i
swam
from
wharf
to
warwick
six
miles
in
a
hot
june
sun
against
one
of
the
strongest
tides
ever
known
in
the
river
it
would
have
been
a
feat
comparatively
easy
to
swim
twenty
miles
in
still
water
i
would
not
think
much
poe
added
in
a
strain
of
exaggeration
not
unusual
with
him
of
attempting
to
swim
the
british
channel
from
dover
to
calais
colonel
mayo
who
had
tried
to
accompany
him
in
this
performance
had
to
stop
on
the
way
and
says
that
poe
when
he
reached
the
goal
emerged
from
the
water
with
neck
face
and
back
blistered
the
facts
of
this
feat
which
was
undertaken
for
a
wager
having
been
questioned
poe
ever
intolerant
of
contradiction
obtained
and
published
the
affidavits
of
several
gentlemen
who
had
witnessed
it
they
also
certified
that
poe
did
not
seem
at
all
fatigued
and
that
he
walked
back
to
richmond
immediately
after
the
performance
the
poet
is
generally
remembered
at
this
part
of
his
career
to
have
been
slight
in
figure
and
person
but
to
have
been
well
made
active
sinewy
and
graceful
despite
the
fact
that
he
was
thus
noted
among
his
schoolfellows
and
indulged
at
home
he
does
not
appear
to
have
been
in
sympathy
with
his
surroundings
already
dowered
with
the
hate
of
hate
the
scorn
of
scorn
he
appears
to
have
made
foes
both
among
those
who
envied
him
and
those
whom
in
the
pride
of
intellectuality
he
treated
with
pugnacious
contempt
beneath
the
haughty
exterior
however
was
a
warm
and
passionate
heart
which
only
needed
circumstance
to
call
forth
an
almost
fanatical
intensity
of
affection
a
instance
of
this
is
thus
related
by
whitman
while
at
the
academy
in
richmond
he
one
day
accompanied
a
schoolmate
to
his
home
where
he
saw
for
the
first
time
helen
stannard
the
mother
of
his
young
friend
this
lady
on
entering
the
room
took
his
hands
and
spoke
some
gentle
and
gracious
words
of
welcome
which
so
penetrated
the
sensitive
heart
of
the
orphan
boy
as
to
deprive
him
of
the
power
of
speech
and
for
a
time
almost
of
consciousness
itself
he
returned
home
in
a
dream
with
but
one
thought
one
hope
in
life
to
hear
again
the
sweet
and
gracious
words
that
had
made
the
desolate
world
so
beautiful
to
him
and
filled
his
lonely
heart
with
the
oppression
of
a
new
joy
this
lady
afterwards
became
the
confidant
of
all
his
boyish
sorrows
and
hers
was
the
one
redeeming
influence
that
saved
and
guided
him
in
the
earlier
days
of
his
turbulent
and
passionate
youth
when
edgar
was
unhappy
at
home
which
says
his
aunt
clemm
was
very
often
the
case
he
went
to
stannard
for
sympathy
for
consolation
and
for
advice
unfortunately
the
sad
fortune
which
so
frequently
thwarted
his
hopes
ended
this
friendship
the
lady
was
overwhelmed
by
a
terrible
calamity
and
at
the
period
when
her
guiding
voice
was
most
requisite
she
fell
a
prey
to
mental
alienation
she
died
and
was
entombed
in
a
neighboring
cemetery
but
her
poor
boyish
admirer
could
not
endure
to
think
of
her
lying
lonely
and
forsaken
in
her
vaulted
home
so
he
would
leave
the
house
at
night
and
visit
her
tomb
when
the
nights
were
drear
when
the
autumnal
rains
fell
and
the
winds
wailed
mournfully
over
the
graves
he
lingered
longest
and
came
away
most
regretfully
the
memory
of
this
lady
of
this
one
idolatrous
and
purely
ideal
love
of
his
boyhood
was
cherished
to
the
last
the
name
of
helen
frequently
recurs
in
his
youthful
verses
the
pæan
now
first
included
in
his
poetical
works
refers
to
her
and
to
her
he
inscribed
the
classic
and
exquisitely
beautiful
stanzas
beginning
helen
thy
beauty
is
to
me
another
important
item
to
be
noted
in
this
epoch
of
his
life
is
that
he
was
already
a
poet
among
his
schoolfellows
he
appears
to
have
acquired
some
little
reputation
as
a
writer
of
satirical
verses
but
of
his
poetry
of
that
which
as
he
declared
had
been
with
him
not
a
purpose
but
a
passion
he
probably
preserved
the
secret
especially
as
we
know
that
at
his
adoptive
home
poesy
was
a
forbidden
thing
as
early
as
he
appears
to
have
essayed
various
pieces
and
some
of
these
were
ultimately
included
in
his
first
volume
with
poe
poetry
was
a
personal
matter
a
channel
through
which
the
turbulent
passions
of
his
heart
found
an
outlet
with
feelings
such
as
were
his
it
came
to
pass
as
a
matter
of
course
that
the
youthful
poet
fell
in
love
his
first
affair
of
the
heart
is
doubtless
reminiscently
portrayed
in
what
he
says
of
his
boyish
ideal
byron
this
passion
he
remarks
if
passion
it
can
properly
be
called
was
of
the
most
thoroughly
romantic
shadowy
and
imaginative
character
it
was
born
of
the
hour
and
of
the
youthful
necessity
to
love
it
had
no
peculiar
regard
to
the
person
or
to
the
character
or
to
the
reciprocating
affection
any
maiden
not
immediately
and
positively
repulsive
he
deems
would
have
suited
the
occasion
of
frequent
and
unrestricted
intercourse
with
such
an
imaginative
and
poetic
youth
the
result
he
deems
was
not
merely
natural
or
merely
probable
it
was
as
inevitable
as
destiny
itself
between
the
lines
may
be
read
the
history
of
his
own
love
the
egeria
of
dreams
the
venus
aphrodite
that
sprang
in
full
and
supernal
loveliness
from
the
bright
foam
upon
the
ocean
of
thoughts
was
a
little
girl
elmira
royster
who
lived
with
her
father
in
a
house
opposite
to
the
allans
in
richmond
the
young
people
met
again
and
again
and
the
lady
who
has
only
recently
passed
away
recalled
edgar
as
a
beautiful
boy
passionately
fond
of
music
enthusiastic
and
impulsive
but
with
prejudices
already
strongly
developed
a
certain
amount
of
took
place
between
the
young
people
and
poe
with
his
usual
passionate
energy
ere
he
left
home
for
the
university
had
persuaded
his
fair
inamorata
to
engage
herself
to
him
poe
left
home
for
the
university
of
virginia
charlottesville
in
the
beginning
of
lie
wrote
frequently
to
miss
royster
but
her
father
did
not
approve
of
the
affair
and
so
the
story
runs
intercepted
the
correspondence
until
it
ceased
at
seventeen
elmira
became
the
bride
of
a
shelton
and
it
was
not
until
some
time
afterwards
that
poe
discovered
how
it
was
his
passionate
appeals
had
failed
to
elicit
any
response
from
the
object
of
his
youthful
affection
poe
short
university
career
was
in
many
respects
a
repetition
of
his
course
at
the
richmond
academy
he
became
noted
at
charlottesville
both
for
his
athletic
feats
and
his
scholastic
successes
he
entered
as
a
student
on
february
and
remained
till
the
close
of
the
second
session
in
december
of
that
year
he
entered
the
schools
of
ancient
and
modern
languages
attending
the
lectures
on
latin
greek
french
spanish
and
italian
i
was
a
member
of
the
last
three
classes
says
william
wertenbaker
the
recently
deceased
librarian
and
can
testify
that
he
was
tolerably
regular
in
his
attendance
and
a
successful
student
having
obtained
distinction
at
the
final
examination
in
latin
and
french
and
this
was
at
that
time
the
highest
honor
a
student
could
obtain
the
present
regulations
in
regard
to
degrees
had
not
then
been
adopted
under
existing
regulations
he
would
have
graduated
in
the
two
languages
and
have
been
entitled
to
diplomas
these
statements
of
poe
classmate
are
confirmed
by
harrison
chairman
of
the
faculty
who
remarks
that
the
poet
was
a
great
favorite
with
his
and
was
noted
for
the
remarkable
rapidity
with
which
he
prepared
his
recitations
and
for
their
accuracy
his
translations
from
the
modern
languages
being
especially
noteworthy
several
of
poe
classmates
at
charlottesville
have
testified
to
his
noble
qualities
and
other
good
endowments
but
they
remember
that
his
disposition
was
rather
retiring
and
that
he
had
few
intimate
associates
thomas
boiling
one
of
his
who
has
favored
us
with
reminiscences
of
him
says
i
was
with
him
but
that
is
about
all
my
impression
was
and
is
that
no
one
could
say
that
he
him
he
wore
a
melancholy
face
always
and
even
his
smile
for
i
do
not
ever
remember
to
have
seen
him
laugh
seemed
to
be
forced
when
he
engaged
sometimes
with
others
in
athletic
exercises
in
which
so
far
as
high
or
long
jumping
i
believe
he
excelled
all
the
rest
poe
with
the
same
ever
sad
face
appeared
to
participate
in
what
was
amusement
to
the
others
more
as
a
task
than
sport
poe
had
no
little
talent
for
drawing
and
john
willis
states
that
the
walls
of
his
college
rooms
were
covered
with
his
crayon
sketches
whilst
boiling
mentions
in
connection
with
the
poet
artistic
facility
some
interesting
incidents
the
two
young
men
had
purchased
copies
of
a
edition
of
byron
poems
and
upon
visiting
poe
a
few
days
after
this
purchase
bolling
found
him
engaged
in
copying
one
of
the
engravings
with
crayon
upon
his
dormitory
ceiling
he
continued
to
amuse
himself
in
this
way
from
time
to
time
until
he
had
filled
all
the
space
in
his
room
with
figures
which
it
is
remembered
by
those
who
saw
them
were
highly
ornamental
and
well
executed
as
bolling
talked
with
his
associate
poe
would
continue
to
scribble
away
with
his
pencil
as
if
writing
and
when
his
visitor
jestingly
remonstrated
with
him
on
his
want
of
politeness
he
replied
that
he
had
been
all
attention
and
proved
that
he
had
by
suitable
comment
assigning
as
a
reason
for
his
apparent
want
of
courtesy
that
he
was
trying
divide
his
mind
to
carry
on
a
conversation
and
write
sensibly
upon
a
totally
different
subject
at
the
same
time
wertenbaker
in
his
interesting
reminiscences
of
the
poet
says
as
librarian
i
had
frequent
official
intercourse
with
poe
but
it
was
at
or
near
the
close
of
the
session
before
i
met
him
in
the
social
circle
after
spending
an
evening
together
at
a
private
house
he
invited
me
on
our
return
into
his
room
it
was
a
cold
night
in
december
and
his
fire
having
gone
pretty
nearly
out
by
the
aid
of
some
tallow
candles
and
the
fragments
of
a
small
table
which
he
broke
up
for
the
purpose
he
soon
rekindled
it
and
by
its
comfortable
blaze
i
spent
a
very
pleasant
hour
with
him
on
this
occasion
he
spoke
with
regret
of
the
large
amount
of
money
he
had
wasted
and
of
the
debts
he
had
contracted
during
the
session
if
my
memory
be
not
at
fault
he
estimated
his
indebtedness
at
and
though
they
were
gaming
debts
he
was
earnest
and
emphatic
in
the
declaration
that
he
was
bound
by
honor
to
pay
them
at
the
earliest
opportunity
this
appears
to
have
been
poe
last
night
at
the
university
he
left
it
never
to
return
yet
short
as
was
his
sojourn
there
he
left
behind
him
such
honorable
memories
that
his
mater
is
now
only
too
proud
to
enrol
his
name
among
her
most
respected
sons
poe
adopted
father
however
did
not
regard
his
collegiate
career
with
equal
pleasure
whatever
view
he
may
have
entertained
of
the
lad
scholastic
successes
he
resolutely
refused
to
discharge
the
gambling
debts
which
like
too
many
of
his
classmates
he
had
incurred
a
violent
altercation
took
place
between
allan
and
the
youth
and
poe
hastily
quitted
the
shelter
of
home
to
try
and
make
his
way
in
the
world
alone
taking
with
him
such
poems
as
he
had
ready
poe
made
his
way
to
boston
and
there
looked
up
some
of
his
mother
old
theatrical
friends
whether
he
thought
of
adopting
the
stage
as
a
profession
or
whether
he
thought
of
getting
their
assistance
towards
helping
him
to
put
a
drama
of
his
own
upon
the
stage
that
dream
of
all
young
authors
is
now
unknown
he
appears
to
have
wandered
about
for
some
time
and
by
some
means
or
the
other
succeeded
in
getting
a
little
volume
of
poems
printed
for
private
circulation
only
this
was
towards
the
end
of
when
he
was
nearing
nineteen
doubtless
poe
expected
to
dispose
of
his
volume
by
subscription
among
his
friends
but
copies
did
not
go
off
and
ultimately
the
book
was
suppressed
and
the
remainder
of
the
edition
for
reasons
of
a
private
nature
destroyed
what
happened
to
the
young
poet
and
how
he
contrived
to
exist
for
the
next
year
or
so
is
a
mystery
still
unsolved
it
has
always
been
believed
that
he
found
his
way
to
europe
and
met
with
some
curious
adventures
there
and
poe
himself
certainly
alleged
that
such
was
the
case
numbers
of
mythical
stories
have
been
invented
to
account
for
this
chasm
in
the
poet
life
and
most
of
them
fabulous
in
a
recent
biography
of
poe
an
attempt
had
been
made
to
prove
that
he
enlisted
in
the
army
under
an
assumed
name
and
served
for
about
eighteen
months
in
the
artillery
in
a
highly
creditable
manner
receiving
an
honorable
discharge
at
the
instance
of
allan
this
account
is
plausible
but
will
need
further
explanation
of
its
many
discrepancies
of
dates
and
verification
of
the
different
documents
cited
in
proof
of
it
before
the
public
can
receive
it
as
fact
so
many
fables
have
been
published
about
poe
and
even
many
fictitious
documents
quoted
that
it
behoves
the
unprejudiced
to
be
wary
in
accepting
any
new
statements
concerning
him
that
are
not
thoroughly
authenticated
on
the
february
allan
died
and
with
her
death
the
final
thread
that
had
bound
poe
to
her
husband
was
broken
the
adopted
son
arrived
too
late
to
take
a
last
farewell
of
her
whose
influence
had
given
the
allan
residence
its
only
claim
upon
the
poet
heart
a
kind
of
truce
was
patched
up
over
the
grave
of
the
deceased
lady
but
for
the
future
poe
found
that
home
was
home
no
longer
again
the
young
man
turned
to
poetry
not
only
as
a
solace
but
as
a
means
of
earning
a
livelihood
again
he
printed
a
little
volume
of
poems
which
included
his
longest
piece
al
aaraaf
and
several
others
now
deemed
classic
the
book
was
a
great
advance
upon
his
previous
collection
but
failed
to
obtain
any
amount
of
public
praise
or
personal
profit
for
its
author
feeling
the
difficulty
of
living
by
literature
at
the
same
time
that
he
saw
he
might
have
to
rely
largely
upon
his
own
exertions
for
a
livelihood
poe
expressed
a
wish
to
enter
the
army
after
no
little
difficulty
a
cadetship
was
obtained
for
him
at
the
west
point
military
academy
a
military
school
in
many
respects
equal
to
the
best
in
europe
for
the
education
of
officers
for
the
army
at
the
time
poe
entered
the
academy
it
possessed
anything
but
an
attractive
character
the
discipline
having
been
of
the
most
severe
character
and
the
accommodation
in
many
respects
unsuitable
for
growing
lads
the
poet
appears
to
have
entered
upon
this
new
course
of
life
with
his
usual
enthusiasm
and
for
a
time
to
have
borne
the
rigid
rules
of
the
place
with
unusual
steadiness
he
entered
the
institution
on
the
july
and
by
the
following
march
had
been
expelled
for
determined
disobedience
whatever
view
may
be
taken
of
poe
conduct
upon
this
occasion
it
must
be
seen
that
the
expulsion
from
west
point
was
of
his
own
seeking
pictures
have
been
drawn
of
his
eccentric
behavior
at
the
academy
but
the
fact
remains
that
he
wilfully
or
at
any
rate
purposely
flung
away
his
cadetship
it
is
surmised
with
plausibility
that
the
second
marriage
of
allan
and
his
expressed
intention
of
withdrawing
his
help
and
of
not
endowing
or
bequeathing
this
adopted
son
any
of
his
property
was
the
mainspring
of
action
believing
it
impossible
to
continue
without
aid
in
a
profession
so
expensive
as
was
a
military
life
he
determined
to
relinquish
it
and
return
to
his
long
cherished
attempt
to
become
an
author
expelled
from
the
institution
that
afforded
board
and
shelter
and
discarded
by
his
former
protector
the
unfortunate
and
penniless
young
man
yet
a
third
time
attempted
to
get
a
start
in
the
world
of
letters
by
means
of
a
volume
of
poetry
if
it
be
true
as
alleged
that
several
of
his
brother
cadets
aided
his
efforts
by
subscribing
for
his
little
work
there
is
some
possibility
that
a
few
dollars
rewarded
this
latest
venture
whatever
may
have
resulted
from
the
alleged
aid
it
is
certain
that
in
a
short
time
after
leaving
the
military
academy
poe
was
reduced
to
sad
straits
he
disappeared
for
nearly
two
years
from
public
notice
and
how
he
lived
during
that
period
has
never
been
satisfactorily
explained
in
he
returns
to
history
in
the
character
of
a
winner
of
a
award
offered
by
a
newspaper
for
the
best
story
the
prize
was
unanimously
adjudged
to
poe
by
the
adjudicators
and
kennedy
an
author
of
some
little
repute
having
become
interested
by
the
young
man
evident
genius
generously
assisted
him
towards
obtaining
a
livelihood
by
literary
labor
through
his
new
introduction
to
the
proprietor
of
the
literary
messenger
a
moribund
magazine
published
at
irregular
intervals
poe
became
first
a
paid
contributor
and
eventually
the
editor
of
the
publication
which
ultimately
he
rendered
one
of
the
most
respected
and
profitable
periodicals
of
the
day
this
success
was
entirely
due
to
the
brilliancy
and
power
of
poe
own
contributions
to
the
magazine
in
march
allan
died
and
if
our
poet
had
maintained
any
hopes
of
further
assistance
from
him
all
doubt
was
settled
by
the
will
by
which
the
whole
property
of
the
deceased
was
left
to
his
second
wife
and
her
three
sons
poe
was
not
named
on
the
may
poe
who
now
had
nothing
but
his
pen
to
trust
to
married
his
cousin
virginia
clemm
a
child
of
only
fourteen
and
with
her
mother
as
housekeeper
started
a
home
of
his
own
in
the
meantime
his
various
writings
in
the
began
to
attract
attention
and
to
extend
his
reputation
into
literary
circles
but
beyond
his
editorial
salary
of
about
brought
him
no
pecuniary
reward
in
january
for
reasons
never
thoroughly
explained
poe
severed
his
connection
with
the
and
moved
with
all
his
household
goods
from
richmond
to
new
york
southern
friends
state
that
poe
was
desirous
of
either
being
admitted
into
partnership
with
his
employer
or
of
being
allowed
a
larger
share
of
the
profits
which
his
own
labors
procured
in
new
york
his
earnings
seem
to
have
been
small
and
irregular
his
most
important
work
having
been
a
republication
from
the
in
book
form
of
his
romance
entitled
gordon

the
truthful
air
of
the
narrative

well
as
its
other
merits
excited
public
curiosity
both
in
england
and
america
but
remuneration
does
not
appear
to
have
been
proportionate
to
its
success
nor
did
he
receive
anything
from
the
numerous
european
editions
the
work
rapidly
passed
through
in
poe
was
induced
by
a
literary
friend
to
break
up
his
new
york
home
and
remove
with
his
wife
and
aunt
her
mother
to
philadelphia
the
quaker
city
was
at
that
time
quite
a
hotbed
for
magazine
projects
and
among
the
many
new
periodicals
poe
was
enabled
to
earn
some
kind
of
a
living
to
burton
magazine
for
he
had
contributed
a
few
articles
but
in
he
arranged
with
its
proprietor
to
take
up
the
editorship
poe
had
long
sought
to
start
a
magazine
of
his
own
and
it
was
probably
with
a
view
to
such
an
eventuality
that
one
of
his
conditions
for
accepting
the
editorship
of
the
was
that
his
name
should
appear
upon
the
poe
worked
hard
at
the
for
some
time
contributing
to
its
columns
much
of
his
best
work
ultimately
however
he
came
to
loggerheads
with
its
proprietor
burton
who
disposed
of
the
magazine
to
a
graham
a
rival
publisher
at
this
period
poe
collected
into
two
volumes
and
got
them
published
as
of
the
grotesque
and
arabesques
of
his
stories
but
he
never
received
any
remuneration
save
a
few
copies
of
the
volumes
for
the
work
for
some
time
the
poet
strove
most
earnestly
to
start
a
magazine
of
his
own
but
all
his
efforts
failed
owing
to
his
want
of
capital
the
purchaser
of
burton
magazine
having
amalgamated
it
with
another
issued
the
two
under
the
title
of
magazine
poe
became
a
contributor
to
the
new
venture
and
in
november
of
the
year
consented
to
assume
the
post
of
editor
under
poe
management
assisted
by
the
liberality
of
graham
magazine
became
a
grand
success
to
its
pages
poe
contributed
some
of
his
finest
and
most
popular
tales
and
attracted
to
the
publication
the
pens
of
many
of
the
best
contemporary
authors
the
public
was
not
slow
in
showing
its
appreciation
of
put
before
it
and
so
its
directors
averred
in
less
than
two
years
the
circulation
rose
from
five
to
thousand
copies
a
great
deal
of
this
success
was
due
to
poe
weird
and
wonderful
stories
still
more
perhaps
to
his
trenchant
critiques
and
his
startling
theories
anent
cryptology
as
regards
the
tales
now
issued
in
attention
may
especially
be
drawn
to
the
murders
in
the
rue
morgue
the
first
of
a
series
une
espèce
de
trilogie
as
baudelaire
styles
them
illustrative
of
an
analytic
phase
of
poe
peculiar
mind
this
of
tales
of
which
the
later
two
were
the
purloined
letter
and
the
mystery
of
marie
roget
was
avowedly
written
to
prove
the
capability
of
solving
the
puzzling
riddles
of
life
by
identifying
another
person
mind
by
our
own
by
trying
to
follow
the
processes
by
which
a
person
would
reason
out
a
certain
thing
poe
propounded
the
theory
that
another
person
might
ultimately
arrive
as
it
were
at
that
person
conclusions
indeed
penetrate
the
innermost
arcanum
of
his
brain
and
read
his
most
secret
thoughts
whilst
the
public
was
still
pondering
over
the
startling
proposition
and
enjoying
perusal
of
its
apparent
proofs
poe
still
further
increased
his
popularity
and
drew
attention
to
his
works
by
putting
forward
the
attractive
but
less
dangerous
theorem
that
human
ingenuity
could
not
construct
a
cipher
which
human
ingenuity
could
not
solve
this
cryptographic
assertion
was
made
in
connection
with
what
the
public
deemed
a
challenge
and
poe
was
inundated
with
ciphers
more
or
less
abstruse
demanding
solution
in
the
correspondence
which
ensued
in
magazine
and
other
publications
poe
was
universally
acknowledged
to
have
proved
his
case
so
far
as
his
own
personal
ability
to
unriddle
such
mysteries
was
concerned
although
he
had
never
offered
to
undertake
such
a
task
he
triumphantly
solved
every
cryptogram
sent
to
him
with
one
exception
and
that
exception
he
proved
conclusively
was
only
an
imposture
for
which
no
solution
was
possible
the
outcome
of
this
exhaustive
and
unprofitable
labor
was
the
fascinating
story
of
the
gold
bug
a
story
in
which
the
discovery
of
hidden
treasure
is
brought
about
by
the
unriddling
of
an
intricate
cipher
the
year
may
be
deemed
the
brightest
of

checkered
career
on
every
side
acknowledged
to
be
a
new
and
brilliant
literary

chief
editor
of
a
powerful
magazine
admired
feared
and
envied
with
a
reputation
already
spreading
rapidly
in
europe
as
well
as
in
his
native
continent
the
poet
might
well
have
hoped
for
prosperity
and
happiness
but
dark
cankers
were
gnawing
his
heart
his
pecuniary
position
was
still
embarrassing
his
writings
which
were
the
result
of
slow
and
careful
labor
were
poorly
paid
and
his
remuneration
as
joint
editor
of
was
small
he
was
not
permitted
to
have
undivided
control
and
but
a
slight
share
of
the
profits
of
the
magazine
he
had
rendered
whilst
a
fearful
domestic
calamity
wrecked
all
his
hopes
and
caused
him
to
resort

refuge

edgar

own
account
of
this
terrible
malady
and
its
cause
was
made
towards
the
end
of
his
career
its
truth
has
never
been
disproved
and
in
its
most
important
points
it
has
been
thoroughly
substantiated
to
a
correspondent
he
writes
in
january
you
say
you
to
me
what
was
that
terrible
evil
which
caused
the
irregularities
so
profoundly
lamented
yes
i
can
do
more
than
hint
this
was
the
greatest
which
can
befall
a
man
six
years
ago
a
wife
whom
i
loved
as
no
man
ever
loved
before
ruptured
a
in
singing
her
life
was
despaired
of
i
took
leave
of
her
forever
and
underwent
all
the
agonies
of
her
death
she
recovered
partially
and
i
again
hoped
at
the
end
of
a
year
the
vessel
broke
again
i
went
through
precisely
the
same
scene
then
again
again
and
even
once
again
at
varying
intervals
each
time
i
felt
all
the
agonies
of
her
death
and
at
each
accession
of
the
disorder
i
loved
her
more
dearly
and
clung
to
her
life
with
more
desperate
pertinacity
but
i
am
constitutionally
sensitive
nervous
in
a
very
unusual
degree
i
became
insane
with
long
intervals
of
horrible
sanity
during
these
fits
of
absolute
unconsciousness
i
drank
god
only
knows
how
often
or
how
much
as
a
matter
of
course
my
enemies
referred
the
insanity
to
the
drink
rather
than
the
drink
to
the
insanity
i
had
indeed
nearly
abandoned
all
hope
of
a
permanent
cure
when
i
found
one
in
the
of
my
wife
this
i
can
and
do
endure
as
becomes
a
man
it
was
the
horrible
oscillation
between
hope
and
despair
which
i
could
longer
have
endured
without
total
loss
of
reason
the
poet
at
this
period
was
residing
in
a
small
but
elegant
little
home
superintended
by
his
guardian
his
wife
mother
his
own
aunt
clemm
the
lady
whom
he
so
gratefully
addressed
in
after
years
in
the
sonnet
as
more
than
mother
unto
me
but
a
change
came
the
spirit
of
his
dream
his
severance
from
owing
to
we
know
not
what
causes
took
place
and
his
fragile
schemes
of
happiness
faded
as
fast
as
the
sunset
his
means
melted
away
and
he
became
unfitted
by
mental
trouble
and
to
earn
more
the
terrible
straits
to
which
he
and
his
unfortunate
beloved
ones
were
reduced
may
be
comprehended
after
perusal
of
these
words
from
a
harris
reminiscences
referring
to
the
poet
residence
in
spring
gardens
philadelphia
this
writer
says
it
was
during
their
stay
there
that
poe
while
singing
one
evening
ruptured
a
and
after
that
she
suffered
a
hundred
deaths
she
could
not
bear
the
slightest
exposure
and
needed
the
utmost
care
and
all
those
conveniences
as
to
apartment
and
surroundings
which
are
so
important
in
the
case
of
an
invalid
were
almost
matters
of
life
and
death
to
her
and
yet
the
room
where
she
lay
for
weeks
hardly
able
to
breathe
except
as
she
was
fanned
was
a
little
narrow
place
with
the
ceiling
so
low
over
the
narrow
bed
that
her
head
almost
touched
it
but
no
one
dared
to
speak
poe
was
so
sensitive
and
irritable
as
steel
and
flint
said
one
who
knew
him
in
those
days
and
he
would
not
allow
a
word
about
the
danger
of
her
dying
the
mention
of
it
drove
him
wild
is
it
to
be
wondered
at
should
it
not
indeed
be
forgiven
him
if
impelled
by
the
anxieties
and
privations
at
home
the
unfortunate
poet
driven
to
the
brink
of
madness
plunged
still
deeper
into
the
slough
of
despond
unable
to
provide
for
the
pressing
necessities
of
his
beloved
wife
the
distracted
man
would
steal
out
of
the
house
at
night
and
go
off
and
wander
about
the
street
for
hours
proud
heartsick
despairing
not
knowing
which
way
to
turn
or
what
to
do
while
clemm
would
endure
the
anxiety
at
home
as
long
as
she
could
and
then
start
off
in
search
of
him
during
his
calmer
moments
poe
exerted
all
his
efforts
to
proceed
with
his
literary
labors
he
continued
to
contribute
to
magazine
the
proprietor
of
which
periodical
remained
his
friend
to
the
end
of
his
life
and
also
to
some
other
leading
publications
of
philadelphia
and
new
york
a
suggestion
having
been
made
to
him
by
willis
of
the
latter
city
he
determined
to
once
more
wander
back
to
it
as
he
found
it
impossible
to
live
upon
his
literary
earnings
where
he
was
accordingly
about
the
middle
of
poe
removed
to
new
york
and
shortly
afterwards
was
engaged
by
willis
and
his
partner
morris
as
on
the
mirror
he
was
says
willis
employed
by
us
for
several
months
as
critic
and
subeditor
he
resided
with
his
wife
and
mother
at
fordham
a
few
miles
out
of
town
but
was
at
his
desk
in
the
office
from
nine
in
the
morning
till
the
evening
paper
went
to
press
with
the
highest
admiration
for
his
genius
and
a
willingness
to
let
it
atone
for
more
than
ordinary
irregularity
we
were
led
by
common
report
to
expect
a
very
capricious
attention
to
his
duties
and
occasionally
a
scene
of
violence
and
difficulty
time
went
on
however
and
he
was
invariably
punctual
and
industrious
with
his
pale
beautiful
and
intellectual
face
as
a
reminder
of
what
genius
was
in
him
it
was
impossible
of
course
not
to
treat
him
always
with
deferential
courtsey
with
a
prospect
of
taking
the
lead
in
another
periodical
he
at
last
voluntarily
gave
up
his
employment
with
us
a
few
weeks
before
poe
relinquished
his
laborious
and
work
on
the
mirror
his
marvellous
poem
of
the
raven
was
published
the
effect
was
magical
never
before
nor
indeed
ever
since
has
a
single
short
poem
produced
such
a
great
and
immediate
enthusiasm
it
did
more
to
render
its
author
famous
than
all
his
other
writings
put
together
it
made
him
the
literary
lion
of
the
season
called
into
existence
innumerable
parodies
was
translated
into
various
languages
and
indeed
created
quite
a
literature
of
its
own
poe
was
naturally
delighted
with
the
success
his
poem
had
attained
and
from
time
to
time
read
it
in
his
musical
manner
in
public
halls
or
at
literary
receptions
nevertheless
he
affected
to
regard
it
as
a
work
of
art
only
and
wrote
his
essay
entitled
the
philosophy
of
composition
to
prove
that
it
was
merely
a
mechanical
production
made
in
accordance
with
certain
set
rules
although
our
poet
reputation
was
now
well
established
he
found
it
still
a
difficult
matter
to
live
by
his
pen
even
when
in
good
health
he
wrote
slowly
and
with
fastidious
care
and
when
his
work
was
done
had
great
difficulty
in
getting
publishers
to
accept
it
since
his
death
it
has
been
proved
that
many
months
often
elapsed
before
he
could
get
either
his
most
admired
poems
or
tales
published
poe
left
the
mirror
in
order
to
take
part
in
the
journal
wherein
he
from
time
to
time
nearly
the
whole
of
his
prose
and
poetry
ultimately
he
acquired
possession
of
this
periodical
but
having
no
funds
to
carry
it
on
after
a
few
months
of
heartbreaking
labor
he
had
to
relinquish
it
exhausted
in
body
and
mind
the
unfortunate
man
now
retreated
with
his
dying
wife
and
her
mother
to
a
quaint
little
cottage
at
fordham
outside
new
york
here
after
a
time
the
unfortunate
household
was
reduced
to
the
utmost
need
not
even
having
wherewith
to
purchase
the
necessities
of
life
at
this
dire
moment
some
friendly
hand
much
to
the
indignation
and
dismay
of
poe
himself
made
an
appeal
to
the
public
on
behalf
of
the
hapless
family
the
appeal
had
the
desired
effect
old
friends
and
new
came
to
the
rescue
and
thanks
to
them
and
especially
to
shew
the
marie
louise
of
poe
later
poems
his
wife
dying
moments
were
soothed
and
the
poet
own
immediate
wants
provided
for
in
january
virginia
poe
died
and
for
some
time
after
her
death
the
poet
remained
in
an
apathetic
stupor
and
indeed
it
may
be
truly
said
that
never
again
did
his
mental
faculties
appear
to
regain
their
former
power
for
another
year
or
so
poe
lived
quietly
at
fordham
guarded
by
the
watchful
care
of
clemm
writing
little
but
thinking
out
his
philosophical
prose
poem
of
eureka
which
he
deemed
the
crowning
work
of
his
life
his
life
was
as
abstemious
and
regular
as
his
means
were
small
gradually
however
as
intercourse
with
fellow
literati
his
dormant
energies
he
began
to
meditate
a
fresh
start
in
the
world
his
old
and
never
thoroughly
abandoned
project
of
starting
a
magazine
of
his
own
for
the
enunciation
of
his
own
views
on
literature
now
absorbed
all
his
thoughts
in
order
to
get
the
necessary
funds
for
establishing
his
publication
on
a
solid
footing
he
determined
to
give
a
series
of
lectures
in
various
parts
of
the
states
his
into
public
life
only
involved
him
in
a
series
of
misfortunes
at
one
time
he
was
engaged
to
be
married
to
whitman
a
widow
lady
of
considerable
intellectual
and
literary
attainments
but
after
several
incidents
of
a
highly
romantic
character
the
match
was
broken
off
in
poe
revisited
the
south
and
amid
the
scenes
and
friends
of
his
early
life
passed
some
not
altogether
unpleasing
time
at
richmond
virginia
he
again
met
his
first
love
elmira
now
a
wealthy
widow
and
after
a
short
renewed
acquaintance
was
once
more
engaged
to
marry
her
but
misfortune
continued
to
dog
his
steps
a
publishing
affair
recalled
him
to
new
york
he
left
richmond
by
boat
for
baltimore
at
which
city
he
arrived
on
the
october
and
handed
his
trunk
to
a
porter
to
carry
to
the
train
for
philadelphia
what
now
happened
has
never
been
clearly
explained
previous
to
starting
on
his
journey
poe
had
complained
of
indisposition
of
chilliness
and
of
exhaustion
and
it
is
not
improbable
that
an
increase
or
continuance
of
these
symptoms
had
tempted
him
to
drink
or
to
resort
to
some
of
those
narcotics
he
is
known
to
have
indulged
in
towards
the
close
of
his
life
whatever
the
cause
of
his
delay
the
consequences
were
fatal
whilst
in
a
state
of
temporary
mania
or
insensibility
he
fell
into
the
hands
of
a
band
of
ruffians
who
were
scouring
the
streets
in
search
of
accomplices
or
victims
what
followed
is
given
on
undoubted
authority
his
captors
carried
the
unfortunate
poet
into
an
electioneering
den
where
they
drugged
him
with
whisky
it
was
election
day
for
a
member
of
congress
and
poe
with
other
victims
was
dragged
from
polling
station
to
station
and
forced
to
vote
the
ticket
placed
in
his
hand
incredible
as
it
may
appear
the
superintending
officials
of
those
days
registered
the
proffered
vote
quite
regardless
of
the
condition
of
the
person
personifying
a
voter
the
election
over
the
dying
poet
was
left
in
the
streets
to
perish
but
being
found
ere
life
was
extinct
he
was
carried
to
the
washington
university
hospital
where
he
expired
on
the
of
october
in
the
year
of
his
age
edgar
poe
was
buried
in
the
family
grave
of
his
grandfather
general
poe
in
the
presence
of
a
few
friends
and
relatives
on
the
november
his
remains
were
removed
from
their
first
and
in
the
presence
of
a
large
number
of
people
were
placed
under
a
marble
monument
subscribed
for
by
some
of
his
many
admirers
his
body
has
recently
been
placed
by
his
side
the
story
of
that
fitful
fever
which
constituted
the
life
of
edgar
poe
leaves
upon
the
reader
mind
the
conviction
that
he
was
indeed
truly
typified
by
that
unhappy
master
whom
unmerciful
disaster
followed
fast
and
followed
faster
till
his
songs
one
burden
bore
till
the
dirges
of
his
hope
that
melancholy
burden
bore
of
nevermore
john
ingram
poems
of
later
life
to
the
noblest
of
her
sex
to
the
author
of
the
drama
of
exile
to
miss
elizabeth
barrett
barrett
of
england
i
dedicate
this
volume
with
the
most
enthusiastic
admiration
and
with
the
most
sincere
esteem
preface
these
trifles
are
collected
and
republished
chiefly
with
a
view
to
their
redemption
from
the
many
improvements
to
which
they
have
been
subjected
while
going
at
random
the
rounds
of
the
press
i
am
naturally
anxious
that
what
i
have
written
should
circulate
as
i
wrote
it
if
it
circulate
at
all
in
defence
of
my
own
taste
nevertheless
it
is
incumbent
upon
me
to
say
that
i
think
nothing
in
this
volume
of
much
value
to
the
public
or
very
creditable
to
myself
events
not
to
be
controlled
have
prevented
me
from
making
at
any
time
any
serious
effort
in
what
under
happier
circumstances
would
have
been
the
field
of
my
choice
with
me
poetry
has
been
not
a
purpose
but
a
passion
and
the
passions
should
be
held
in
reverence
they
must
not
they
can
not
at
will
be
excited
with
an
eye
to
the
paltry
compensations
or
the
more
paltry
commendations
of
mankind
the
raven
once
upon
a
midnight
dreary
while
i
pondered
weak
and
weary
over
many
a
quaint
and
curious
volume
of
forgotten
lore
while
i
nodded
nearly
napping
suddenly
there
came
a
tapping
as
of
some
one
gently
rapping
rapping
at
my
chamber
door
is
some
visitor
i
muttered
tapping
at
my
chamber
door
only
this
and
nothing
more
ah
distinctly
i
remember
it
was
in
the
bleak
december
and
each
separate
dying
ember
wrought
its
ghost
upon
the
floor
eagerly
i
wished
the
morrow
vainly
i
had
sought
to
borrow
from
my
books
surcease
of
sorrow
sorrow
for
the
lost
lenore
for
the
rare
and
radiant
maiden
whom
the
angels
name
lenore
nameless
here
for
evermore
and
the
silken
sad
uncertain
rustling
of
each
purple
curtain
thrilled
me
filled
me
with
fantastic
terrors
never
felt
before
so
that
now
to
still
the
beating
of
my
heart
i
stood
repeating
is
some
visitor
entreating
entrance
at
my
chamber
door
some
late
visitor
entreating
entrance
at
my
chamber
door
this
it
is
and
nothing
more
presently
my
soul
grew
stronger
hesitating
then
no
longer
sir
said
i
or
madam
truly
your
forgiveness
i
implore
but
the
fact
is
i
was
napping
and
so
gently
you
came
rapping
and
so
faintly
you
came
tapping
tapping
at
my
chamber
door
that
i
scarce
was
sure
i
heard
you
here
i
opened
wide
the
door
darkness
there
and
nothing
more
deep
into
that
darkness
peering
long
i
stood
there
wondering
fearing
doubting
dreaming
dreams
no
mortal
ever
dared
to
dream
before
but
the
silence
was
unbroken
and
the
darkness
gave
no
token
and
the
only
word
there
spoken
was
the
whispered
word
lenore
this
i
whispered
and
an
echo
murmured
back
the
word
lenore
merely
this
and
nothing
more
back
into
the
chamber
turning
all
my
soul
within
me
burning
soon
i
heard
again
a
tapping
somewhat
louder
than
before
surely
said
i
surely
that
is
something
at
my
window
lattice
let
me
see
then
what
thereat
is
and
this
mystery
explore
let
my
heart
be
still
a
moment
and
this
mystery
explore
is
the
wind
and
nothing
more
open
here
i
flung
the
shutter
when
with
many
a
flirt
and
flutter
in
there
stepped
a
stately
raven
of
the
saintly
days
of
yore
not
the
least
obeisance
made
he
not
an
instant
stopped
or
stayed
he
but
with
mien
of
lord
or
lady
perched
above
my
chamber
door
perched
upon
a
bust
of
pallas
just
above
my
chamber
door
perched
and
sat
and
nothing
more
then
this
ebony
bird
beguiling
my
sad
fancy
into
smiling
by
the
grave
and
stern
decorum
of
the
countenance
it
wore
though
thy
crest
be
shorn
and
shaven
thou
i
said
art
sure
no
craven
ghastly
grim
and
ancient
raven
wandering
from
the
nightly
shore
tell
me
what
thy
lordly
name
is
on
the
night
plutonian
shore
quoth
the
raven
nevermore
much
i
marvelled
this
ungainly
fowl
to
hear
discourse
so
plainly
though
its
answer
little
meaning
little
relevancy
bore
for
we
can
not
help
agreeing
that
no
living
human
being
ever
yet
was
blessed
with
seeing
bird
above
his
chamber
door
bird
or
beast
upon
the
sculptured
bust
above
his
chamber
door
with
such
name
as
nevermore
but
the
raven
sitting
lonely
on
that
placid
bust
spoke
only
that
one
word
as
if
his
soul
in
that
one
word
he
did
outpour
nothing
further
then
he
uttered
not
a
feather
then
he
fluttered
till
i
scarcely
more
than
muttered
other
friends
have
flown
before
on
the
morrow
will
leave
me
as
my
hopes
have
flown
before
then
the
bird
said
nevermore
startled
at
the
stillness
broken
by
reply
so
aptly
spoken
doubtless
said
i
what
it
utters
is
its
only
stock
and
store
caught
from
some
unhappy
master
whom
unmerciful
disaster
followed
fast
and
followed
faster
till
his
songs
one
burden
bore
till
the
dirges
of
his
hope
the
melancholy
burden
bore
of
nevermore
but
the
raven
still
beguiling
all
my
sad
soul
into
smiling
straight
i
wheeled
a
cushioned
seat
in
front
of
bird
and
bust
and
door
then
upon
the
velvet
sinking
i
betook
myself
to
linking
fancy
unto
fancy
thinking
what
this
ominous
bird
of
yore
what
this
grim
ungainly
ghastly
gaunt
and
ominous
bird
of
yore
meant
in
croaking
nevermore
this
i
sat
engaged
in
guessing
but
no
syllable
expressing
to
the
fowl
whose
fiery
eyes
now
burned
into
my
bosom
core
this
and
more
i
sat
divining
with
my
head
at
ease
reclining
on
the
cushion
velvet
lining
that
the
gloated
but
whose
velvet
violet
lining
with
the
gloating
shall
press
ah
nevermore
then
methought
the
air
grew
denser
perfumed
from
an
unseen
censer
swung
by
seraphim
whose
tinkled
on
the
tufted
floor
wretch
i
cried
thy
god
hath
lent
thee
by
these
angels
he
hath
sent
thee
respite
respite

nepenthé
from
thy
memories
of
lenore

oh
quaff

raven
never

is
sitting
still
is
sitting
on
the
pallid
bust
of
pallas
just
above
my
chamber
door
and
his
eyes
have
all
the
seeming
of
a
demon
that
is
dreaming
and
the
him
streaming
throws
his
shadow
on
the
floor
and
my
soul
from
out
that
shadow
that
lies
floating
on
the
floor
shall
be
lifted

published
the
bells
i
hear
the
sledges
with
the
bells
silver
bells
what
a
world
of
merriment
their
melody
foretells
how
they
tinkle
tinkle
tinkle
in
their
icy
air
of
night
while
the
stars
that
oversprinkle
all
the
heavens
seem
to
twinkle
with
a
crystalline
delight
keeping
time
time
time
in
a
sort
of
runic
rhyme
to
the
tintinnabulation
that
so
musically
wells
from
the
bells

from
the
jingling
and
the
tinkling

hear
the
mellow
wedding
bells
golden
bells
what
a
world
of
happiness
their
harmony
foretells
through
the
balmy
air
of
night
how
they
ring
out
their
delight
from
the
molten
and
all
in
tune
what
a
liquid
ditty
floats
to
the
that
listens
while
she
gloats
on
the
moon
oh
from
out
the
sounding
cells
what
a
gush
of
euphony
voluminously
wells
how
it
swells
how
it
dwells
on
the
future
how
it
tells
of
the
rapture
that
impels
to
the
swinging
and
the
ringing
of
the
bells
bells

of
the

to
the
rhyming
and
the
chiming
of

bells
iii
hear
the
loud
alarum
bells
brazen
bells
what
a
tale
of
terror
now
their
turbulency
tells
in
the
startled
ear
of
night
how
they
scream
out
their
affright
too
much
horrified
to
speak
they
can
only
shriek
shriek
out
of
tune
in
a
clamorous
appealing
to
the
mercy
of
the
fire
in
a
mad
expostulation
with
the
deaf
and
frantic
fire
leaping
higher
higher
higher
with
a
desperate
desire
and
a
resolute
endeavor
now
now
to
sit
or
never
by
the
side
of
the
moon
oh
the
bells
bells
bells
what
a
tale
their
terror
tells
of
despair
how
they
clang
and
clash
and
roar
what
a
horror
they
outpour
on
the
bosom
of
the
palpitating
air
yet
the
ear
it
fully
knows
by
the
twanging
and
the
clanging
how
the
danger
ebbs
and
flows
yet
the
ear
distinctly
tells
in
the
jangling
and
the
wrangling
how
the
danger
sinks
and
swells
by
the
sinking
or
the
swelling
in
the
anger
of
the
bells
of
the
bells
of

in

clamor

clangor

what
a
world
of
solemn
thought
their
monody
compels
in
the
silence
of
the
night
how
we
shiver
with
affright
at
the
melancholy
menace
of
their
tone
for
every
sound
that
floats
from
the
rust
within
their
throats
is
a
groan
and
the
people
ah
the
people
they
that
dwell
up
in
the
steeple
all
alone
and
who
tolling
tolling
tolling
in
that
muffled
monotone
feel
a
glory
in
so
rolling
on
the
human
heart
a
stone
they
are
neither
man
nor
woman
they
are
neither
brute
nor
human
they
are
ghouls
and
their
king
it
is
who
tolls
and
he
rolls
rolls
rolls
rolls
a
pæan
from
the
bells
and
his
merry
bosom
swells
with
the
pæan
of
the
bells
and
he
dances
and
he
yells
keeping
time
time
time
in
a
sort
of
runic
rhyme
to
the
pæan
of
the
bells
of
the
bells
keeping
time
time

in
a
sort
of
runic
rhyme
to
the
throbbing
of
the

of

sobbing
of

to

groaning
of

ulalume
the
skies
they
were
ashen
and
sober
the
leaves
they
were
crisped
and
sere
the
leaves
they
were
withering
and
sere
it
was
night
in
the
lonesome
october
of
my
most
immemorial
year
it
was
hard
by
the
dim
lake
of
auber
in
the
misty
mid
region
of
weir
it
was
down
by
the
dank
tarn
of
auber
in
the
woodland
of
weir
here
once
through
an
alley
titanic
of
cypress
i
roamed
with
my
soul
of
cypress
with
psyche
my
soul
these
were
days
when
my
heart
was
volcanic
as
the
scoriac
rivers
that
roll
as
the
lavas
that
restlessly
roll
their
sulphurous
currents
down
yaanek
in
the
ultimate
climes
of
the
pole
that
groan
as
they
roll
down
mount
yaanek
in
the
realms
of
the
boreal
pole
our
talk
had
been
serious
and
sober
but
our
thoughts
they
were
palsied
and
sere
our
memories
were
treacherous
and
sere
for
we
knew
not
the
month
was
october
and
we
marked
not
the
night
of
the
year
ah
night
of
all
nights
in
the
year
we
noted
not
the
dim
lake
of
auber
though
once
we
had
journeyed
down
here
remembered
not
the
dank
tarn
of
auber
nor
the
woodland
of
weir
and
now
as
the
night
was
senescent
and
pointed
to
morn
as
the
hinted
of
morn
at
the
end
of
our
path
a
liquescent
and
nebulous
lustre
was
born
out
of
which
a
miraculous
crescent
arose
with
a
duplicate
horn
astarte
bediamonded
crescent
distinct
with
its
duplicate
horn
and
i
said
she
is
warmer
than
dian
she
rolls
through
an
ether
of
sighs
she
revels
in
a
region
of
sighs
she
has
seen
that
the
tears
are
not
dry
on
these
cheeks
where
the
worm
never
dies
and
has
come
past
the
stars
of
the
lion
to
point
us
the
path
to
the
skies
to
the
lethean
peace
of
the
skies
come
up
in
despite
of
the
lion
to
shine
on
us
with
her
bright
eyes
come
up
through
the
lair
of
the
lion
with
love
in
her
luminous
eyes
but
psyche
uplifting
her
finger
said
sadly
this
star
i
mistrust
her
pallor
i
strangely
mistrust
oh
hasten
oh
let
us
not
linger
oh
fly
let
us
fly
for
we
must
in
terror
she
spoke
letting
sink
her
wings
till
they
trailed
in
the
dust
in
agony
sobbed
letting
sink
her
plumes
till
they
trailed
in
the
dust
till
they
sorrowfully
trailed
in
the
dust
i
replied
this
is
nothing
but
dreaming
let
us
on
by
this
tremulous
light
let
us
bathe
in
this
crystalline
light
its
sibyllic
splendor
is
beaming
with
hope
and
in
beauty
see
it
flickers
up
the
sky
through
the
night
ah
we
safely
may
trust
to
its
gleaming
and
be
sure
it
will
lead
us
aright
we
safely
may
trust
to
a
gleaming
that
can
not
but
guide
us
aright
since
it
flickers
up
to
heaven
through
the
night
thus
i
pacified
psyche
and
kissed
her
and
tempted
her
out
of
her
gloom
and
conquered
her
scruples
and
gloom
and
we
passed
to
the
end
of
a
vista
but
were
stopped
by
the
door
of
a
tomb
by
the
door
of
a
legended
tomb
and
i
said
what
is
written
sweet
sister
on
the
door
of
this
legended
tomb
she
replied
ulalume
ulalume
is
the
vault
of
thy
lost
ulalume
then
my
heart
it
grew
ashen
and
sober
as
the
leaves
that
were
crisped
and
sere
as
the
leaves
that
were
withering
and
sere
and
i
cried
it
was
surely
october
on
very
night
of
last
year
that
i
journeyed
i
journeyed
down
here
that
i
brought
a
dread
burden
down
here
on
this
night
of
all
nights
in
the
year
ah
what
demon
has
tempted
me
here
well
i
know
now
this
dim
lake
of
auber
this
misty
mid
region
of
weir
well
i
know
now
this
dank
tarn
of
auber
this
woodland
of
weir
to
helen
i
saw
thee
once
once
only
years
ago
i
must
not
say
many
but
many
it
was
a
july
midnight
and
from
out
a
moon
that
like
thine
own
soul
soaring
sought
a
precipitate
pathway
up
through
heaven
there
fell
a
veil
of
light
with
quietude
and
sultriness
and
slumber
upon
the
upturn
faces
of
a
thousand
roses
that
grew
in
an
enchanted
garden
where
no
wind
dared
to
stir
unless
on
tiptoe
fell
on
the
upturn
faces
of
these
roses
that
gave
out
in
return
for
the
their
odorous
souls
in
an
ecstatic
death
fell
on
the
upturn
faces
of
these
roses
that
smiled
and
died
in
this
parterre
enchanted
by
thee
and
by
the
poetry
of
thy
presence
clad
all
in
white
upon
a
violet
bank
i
saw
thee
while
the
moon
fell
on
the
upturn
faces
of
the
roses
and
on
thine
own
upturn
alas
in
sorrow
was
it
not
fate
that
on
this
july
midnight
was
it
not
fate
whose
name
is
also
sorrow
that
bade
me
pause
before
that
to
breathe
the
incense
of
those
slumbering
roses
no
footstep
stirred
the
hated
world
all
slept
save
only
thee
and
me
o
heaven
o
god
how
my
heart
beats
in
coupling
those
two
words
save
only
thee
and
me
i
paused
i
looked
and
in
an
instant
all
things
disappeared
ah
bear
in
mind
this
garden
was
enchanted
the
pearly
lustre
of
the
moon
went
out
the
mossy
banks
and
the
meandering
paths
the
happy
flowers
and
the
repining
trees
were
seen
no
more
the
very
roses
odors
died
in
the
arms
of
the
adoring
airs
all
all
expired
save
thee
save
less
than
thou
save
only
the
divine
light
in
thine
eyes
save
but
the
soul
in
thine
uplifted
eyes
i
saw
but
them
they
were
the
world
to
me
i
saw
but
them
saw
only
them
for
hours
saw
only
them
until
the
moon
went
down
what
wild
seemed
to
lie
unwritten
upon
those
crystalline
celestial
spheres
how
dark
a
woe
yet
how
sublime
a
hope
how
silently
serene
a
sea
of
pride
how
daring
an
ambition
yet
how
deep
how
fathomless
a
capacity
for
love
but
now
at
length
dear
dian
sank
from
sight
into
a
western
couch
of
and
thou
a
ghost
amid
the
entombing
trees
didst
glide
away
thine
eyes
they
go
they
never
yet
have
gone
lighting
my
lonely
pathway
home
that
night
have
not
left
me
as
my
hopes
have
since
they
follow
me
they
lead
me
through
the
years
they
are
my
ministers
yet
i
their
slave
their
office
is
to
illumine
and
enkindle
my
duty
be
by
their
bright
light
and
purified
in
their
electric
fire
and
sanctified
in
their
elysian
fire
they
fill
my
soul
with
beauty
which
is
hope
and
are
far
up
in
heaven
the
stars
i
kneel
to
in
the
sad
silent
watches
of
my
night
while
even
in
the
meridian
glare
of
day
i
see
them
still
two
sweetly
scintillant
venuses
unextinguished
by
the
sun
annabel
lee
it
was
many
and
many
a
year
ago
in
a
kingdom
by
the
sea
that
a
maiden
there
lived
whom
you
may
know
by
the
name
of
annabel
lee
and
this
maiden
she
lived
with
no
other
thought
than
to
love
and
be
loved
by
me
was
a
child
and
was
a
child
in
this
kingdom
by
the
sea
but
we
loved
with
a
love
that
was
more
than
love
i
and
my
annabel
lee
with
a
love
that
the
winged
seraphs
of
heaven
coveted
her
and
me
and
this
was
the
reason
that
long
ago
in
this
kingdom
by
the
sea
a
wind
blew
out
of
a
cloud
chilling
my
beautiful
annabel
lee
so
that
her
highborn
kinsmen
came
and
bore
her
away
from
me
to
shut
her
up
in
a
sepulchre
in
this
kingdom
by
the
sea
the
angels
not
half
so
happy
in
heaven
went
envying
her
and
me
yes
that
was
the
reason
as
all
men
know
in
this
kingdom
by
the
sea
that
the
wind
came
out
of
the
cloud
by
night
chilling
and
killing
my
annabel
lee
but
our
love
it
was
stronger
by
far
than
the
love
of
those
who
were
older
than
we
of
many
far
wiser
than
we
and
neither
the
angels
in
heaven
above
nor
the
demons
down
under
the
sea
can
ever
dissever
my
soul
from
the
soul
of
the
beautiful
annabel
lee
for
the
moon
never
beams
without
bringing
me
dreams
of
the
beautiful
annabel
lee
and
the
stars
never
rise
but
i
see
the
bright
eyes
of
the
beautiful
annabel
lee
and
so
all
the
i
lie
down
by
the
side
of
my
darling
my
darling
my
life
and
my
bride
in
her
sepulchre
there
by
the
sea
in
her
tomb
by
the
side
of
the
sea
a
valentine
for
her
this
rhyme
is
penned
whose
luminous
eyes
brightly
expressive
as
the
twins
of
leda
shall
find
her
own
sweet
name
that
nestling
lies
upon
the
page
enwrapped
from
every
reader
search
narrowly
the
lines
they
hold
a
treasure
divine
a
talisman
an
amulet
that
must
be
worn
search
well
the
measure
the
words
the
syllables
do
not
forget
the
trivialest
point
or
you
may
lose
your
labor
and
yet
there
is
in
this
no
gordian
knot
which
one
might
not
undo
without
a
sabre
if
one
could
merely
comprehend
the
plot
enwritten
upon
the
leaf
where
now
are
peering
eyes
scintillating
soul
there
lie
three
eloquent
words
oft
uttered
in
the
hearing
of
poets
by
poets
as
the
name
is
a
poet
too
its
letters
although
naturally
lying
like
the
knight
pinto
mendez
ferdinando
still
form
a
synonym
for
truth
cease
trying
you
will
not
read
the
riddle
though
you
do
the
best
you
do
to
discover
the
names
in
this
and
the
following
poem
read
the
first
letter
of
the
first
line
in
connection
with
the
second
letter
of
the
second
line
the
third
letter
of
the
third
line
the
fourth
of
the
fourth
and
so
on
to
the
end
an
enigma
seldom
we
find
says
solomon
don
dunce
half
an
idea
in
the
profoundest
sonnet
through
all
the
flimsy
things
we
see
at
once
as
easily
as
through
a
naples
bonnet
trash
of
all
trash
how
a
lady
don
it
yet
heavier
far
than
your
petrarchan
stuff
nonsense
that
the
faintest
puff
twirls
into
the
while
you
con
it
and
veritably
sol
is
right
enough
the
general
tuckermanities
are
arrant
bubbles
ephemeral
and
transparent
but
now
you
may
depend
upon
it
stable
opaque
immortal
all
by
dint
of
the
dear
names
that
lie
concealed
withi
see
note
after
previous
poem
to
my
mother
because
i
feel
that
in
the
heavens
above
the
angels
whispering
to
one
another
can
find
among
their
burning
terms
of
love
none
so
devotional
as
that
of
mother
therefore
by
that
dear
name
i
long
have
called
you
you
who
are
more
than
mother
unto
me
and
fill
my
heart
of
hearts
where
death
installed
you
in
setting
my
virginia
spirit
free
my
mother
my
own
mother
who
died
early
was
but
the
mother
of
myself
but
you
are
mother
to
the
one
i
loved
so
dearly
and
thus
are
dearer
than
the
mother
i
knew
by
that
infinity
with
which
my
wife
was
dearer
to
my
soul
than
its
the
above
was
addressed
to
the
poet
mrs
ed
for
annie
thank
heaven
the
crisis
the
danger
is
past
and
the
lingering
illness
is
over
at
last
and
the
fever
called
living
is
conquered
at
last
sadly
i
know
i
am
shorn
of
my
strength
and
no
muscle
i
move
as
i
lie
at
full
length
but
no
matter
i
feel
i
am
better
at
length
and
i
rest
so
composedly
now
in
my
bed
that
any
beholder
might
fancy
me
dead
might
start
at
beholding
me
thinking
me
dead
the
moaning
and
groaning
the
sighing
and
sobbing
are
quieted
now
with
that
horrible
throbbing
at
heart
ah
that
horrible
horrible
throbbing
the
sickness
the
nausea
the
pitiless
pain
have
ceased
with
the
fever
that
maddened
my
brain
with
the
fever
called
living
that
burned
in
my
brain
and
oh
of
all
tortures
torture
the
worst
has
abated
the
terrible
torture
of
thirst
for
the
naphthaline
river
of
passion
accurst
i
have
drank
of
a
water
that
quenches
all
thirst
of
a
water
that
flows
with
a
lullaby
sound
from
a
spring
but
a
very
few
feet
under
ground
from
a
cavern
not
very
far
down
under
ground
and
ah
let
it
never
be
foolishly
said
that
my
room
it
is
gloomy
and
narrow
my
bed
for
man
never
slept
in
a
different
bed
and
to
you
must
slumber
in
just
such
a
bed
my
tantalized
spirit
here
blandly
reposes
forgetting
or
never
regretting
its
roses
its
old
agitations
of
myrtles
and
roses
for
now
while
so
quietly
lying
it
fancies
a
holier
odor
about
it
of
pansies
a
rosemary
odor
commingled
with
pansies
with
rue
and
the
beautiful
puritan
pansies
and
so
it
lies
happily
bathing
in
many
a
dream
of
the
truth
and
the
beauty
of
annie
drowned
in
a
bath
of
the
tresses
of
annie
she
tenderly
kissed
me
she
fondly
caressed
and
then
i
fell
gently
to
sleep
on
her
breast
deeply
to
sleep
from
the
heaven
of
her
breast
when
the
light
was
extinguished
she
covered
me
warm
and
she
prayed
to
the
angels
to
keep
me
from
harm
to
the
queen
of
the
angels
to
shield
me
from
harm
and
i
lie
so
composedly
now
in
my
bed
knowing
her
love
that
you
fancy
me
dead
and
i
rest
so
contentedly
now
in
my
bed
with
her
love
at
my
breast
that
you
fancy
me
dead
that
you
shudder
to
look
at
me
thinking
me
dead
but
my
heart
it
is
brighter
than
all
of
the
many
stars
in
the
sky
for
it
sparkles
with
annie
it
glows
with
the
light
of
the
love
of
my
annie
with
the
thought
of
the
light
of
the
eyes
of
my
annie
to
f
beloved
amid
the
earnest
woes
that
crowd
around
my
earthly
path
drear
path
alas
where
grows
not
even
one
lonely
rose
my
soul
at
least
a
solace
hath
in
dreams
of
thee
and
therein
knows
an
eden
of
bland
repose
and
thus
thy
memory
is
to
me
like
some
enchanted
isle
in
some
tumultuous
sea
some
ocean
throbbing
far
and
free
with
storm
but
where
meanwhile
serenest
skies
continually
just
that
one
bright
inland
smile
to
frances
osgood
thou
wouldst
be
loved
then
let
thy
heart
from
its
present
pathway
part
not
being
everything
which
now
thou
art
be
nothing
which
thou
art
not
so
with
the
world
thy
gentle
ways
thy
grace
thy
more
than
beauty
shall
be
an
endless
theme
of
praise
and
love
a
simple
duty
eldorado
gaily
bedight
a
gallant
knight
in
sunshine
and
in
shadow
had
journeyed
long
singing
a
song
in
search
of
eldorado
but
he
grew
old
this
knight
so
bold
and
his
heart
a
shadow
fell
as
he
found
no
spot
of
ground
that
looked
like
eldorado
and
as
his
strength
failed
him
at
length
he
met
a
pilgrim
shadow
shadow
said
he
where
can
it
be
this
land
of
eldorado
over
the
mountains
of
the
moon
down
the
valley
of
the
shadow
ride
boldly
ride
the
shade
replied
if
you
seek
for
eldorado
eulalie
i
dwelt
alone
in
a
world
of
moan
and
my
soul
was
a
stagnant
tide
till
the
fair
and
gentle
eulalie
became
my
blushing
bride
till
the
young
eulalie
became
my
smiling
bride
ah
less
less
bright
the
stars
of
the
night
than
the
eyes
of
the
radiant
girl
and
never
a
flake
that
the
vapor
can
make
with
the
of
purple
and
pearl
can
vie
with
the
modest
eulalie
most
unregarded
curl
can
compare
with
the
eulalie
most
humble
and
careless
curl
now
doubt
now
pain
come
never
again
for
her
soul
gives
me
sigh
for
sigh
and
all
day
long
shines
bright
and
strong
astarté
within
the
sky
while
ever
to
her
dear
eulalie
upturns
her
matron
eye
while
ever
to
her
young
eulalie
upturns
her
violet
eye
a
dream
within
a
dream
take
this
kiss
upon
the
brow
and
in
parting
from
you
now
thus
much
let
me
avow
you
are
not
wrong
who
deem
that
my
days
have
been
a
dream
yet
if
hope
has
flown
away
in
a
night
or
in
a
day
in
a
vision
or
in
none
is
it
therefore
the
less
that
we
see
or
seem
is
but
a
dream
within
a
dream
i
stand
amid
the
roar
of
a
shore
and
i
hold
within
my
hand
grains
of
the
golden
sand
how
few
yet
how
they
creep
through
my
fingers
to
the
deep
while
i
weep
while
i
weep
o
god
can
i
not
grasp
them
with
a
tighter
clasp
o
god
can
i
not
save
from
the
pitiless
wave
is
that
we
see
or
seem
but
a
dream
within
a
dream
to
marie
louise
shew
of
all
who
hail
thy
presence
as
the
morning
of
all
to
whom
thine
absence
is
the
night
the
blotting
utterly
from
out
high
heaven
the
sacred
sun
of
all
who
weeping
bless
thee
hourly
for
hope
for
life
ah
above
all
for
the
resurrection
of
deep
buried
faith
in
truth
in
virtue
in
humanity
of
all
who
on
despair
unhallowed
bed
lying
down
to
die
have
suddenly
arisen
at
thy
words
let
there
be
light
at
thy
words
that
were
fulfilled
in
thy
seraphic
glancing
of
thine
eyes
of
all
who
owe
thee
most
whose
gratitude
nearest
resembles
worship
oh
remember
the
truest
the
most
fervently
devoted
and
think
that
these
weak
lines
are
written
by
him
by
him
who
as
he
pens
them
thrills
to
think
his
spirit
is
communing
with
an
angel
to
marie
louise
shew
not
long
ago
the
writer
of
these
lines
in
the
mad
pride
of
intellectuality
maintained
the
power
of
words
denied
that
ever
a
thought
arose
within
the
human
brain
beyond
the
utterance
of
the
human
tongue
and
now
as
if
in
mockery
of
that
boast
two
words
two
foreign
soft
dissyllables
italian
tones
made
only
to
be
murmured
by
angels
dreaming
in
the
moonlit
dew
that
hangs
like
chains
of
pearl
on
hermon
hill
have
stirred
from
out
the
abysses
of
his
heart
thoughts
that
are
the
souls
of
thought
richer
far
wilder
far
diviner
visions
than
even
the
seraph
harper
israfel
who
has
the
sweetest
voice
of
all
god
creatures
could
hope
to
utter
and
i
my
spells
are
broken
the
pen
falls
powerless
from
my
shivering
hand
with
thy
dear
name
as
text
though
hidden
by
thee
i
can
not
write
i
can
not
speak
or
think
alas
i
can
not
feel
for
is
not
feeling
this
standing
motionless
upon
the
golden
threshold
of
the
gate
of
dreams
gazing
entranced
adown
the
gorgeous
vista
and
thrilling
as
i
see
upon
the
right
upon
the
left
and
all
the
way
along
amid
empurpled
vapors
far
away
to
where
the
prospect
terminates
the
city
in
the
sea
lo
death
has
reared
himself
a
throne
in
a
strange
city
lying
alone
far
down
within
the
dim
west
where
the
good
and
the
bad
and
the
worst
and
the
best
have
gone
to
their
eternal
rest
there
shrines
and
palaces
and
towers
towers
and
tremble
not
resemble
nothing
that
is
ours
around
by
lifting
winds
forgot
resignedly
beneath
the
sky
the
melancholy
waters
lie
no
rays
from
the
holy
heaven
come
down
on
the
long
of
that
town
but
light
from
out
the
lurid
sea
streams
up
the
turrets
silently
gleams
up
the
pinnacles
far
and
free
up
domes
up
spires
up
kingly
halls
up
fanes
up
walls
up
shadowy
bowers
of
sculptured
ivy
and
stone
flowers
up
many
and
many
a
marvellous
shrine
whose
wreathed
friezes
intertwine
the

the
vine
resignedly
beneath
the
sky
the
melancholy
waters
lie
so
blend
the
turrets
and
shadows
there
that
all
seem
pendulous
in
air
while
from
a
proud
tower
in
the
town
death
looks
gigantically
down
there
open
fanes
and
gaping
graves
yawn
level
with
the
luminous
waves
but
not
the
riches
there
that
lie
in
each
idol
diamond
eye
not
the
dead
tempt
the
waters
from
their
bed
for
no
ripples
curl
alas
along
that
wilderness
of
glass
no
swellings
tell
that
winds
may
be
upon
some
happier
sea
no
heavings
hint
that
winds
have
been
on
seas
less
hideously
serene
but
lo
a
stir
is
in
the
air
the
wave
there
is
a
movement
there
as
if
the
towers
had
thrust
aside
in
slightly
sinking
the
dull
tide
as
if
their
tops
had
feebly
given
a
void
within
the
filmy
heaven
the
waves
have
now
a
redder
glow
the
hours
are
breathing
faint
and
low
and
when
amid
no
earthly
moans
down
down
that
town
shall
settle
hence
hell
rising
from
a
thousand
thrones
shall
do
it
reverence
the
sleeper
at
midnight
in
the
month
of
june
i
stand
beneath
the
mystic
moon
an
opiate
vapor
dewy
dim
exhales
from
out
her
golden
rim
and
softly
dripping
drop
by
drop
upon
the
quiet
mountain
top
steals
drowsily
and
musically
into
the
universal
valley
the
rosemary
nods
upon
the
grave
the
lily
lolls
upon
the
wave
wrapping
the
fog
about
its
breast
the
ruin
moulders
into
rest
looking
like
lethe
see
the
lake
a
conscious
slumber
seems
to
take
and
would
not
for
the
world
awake
all
beauty
sleeps
and
lo
where
lies
her
casement
open
to
the
skies
irene
with
her
destinies
oh
lady
bright
can
it
be
right
this
window
open
to
the
night
the
wanton
airs
from
the
laughingly
through
the
the
bodiless
airs
a
wizard
rout
flit
through
thy
chamber
in
and
out
and
wave
the
curtain
canopy
so
fitfully
so
fearfully
above
the
closed
and
fringed
lid
which
thy
soul
lies
hid
that
the
floor
and
down
the
wall
like
ghosts
the
shadows
rise
and
fall
oh
lady
dear
hast
thou
no
fear
why
and
what
art
thou
dreaming
here
sure
thou
art
come
seas
a
wonder
to
these
garden
trees
strange
is
thy
pallor
strange
thy
dress
strange
above
all
thy
length
of
tress
and
this
silentness
the
lady
sleeps
oh
may
her
sleep
which
is
enduring
so
be
deep
heaven
have
her
in
its
sacred
keep
this
chamber
changed
for
one
more
holy
this
bed
for
one
more
melancholy
i
pray
to
god
that
she
may
lie
for
ever
with
unopened
eye
while
the
dim
sheeted
ghosts
go
by
my
love
she
sleeps
oh
may
her
sleep
as
it
is
lasting
so
be
deep
soft
may
the
worms
about
her
creep
far
in
the
forest
dim
and
old
for
her
may
some
tall
vault
unfold
some
vault
that
oft
hath
flung
its
black
and
winged
panels
fluttering
back
triumphant
the
crested
palls
of
her
grand
family
funerals
some
sepulchre
remote
alone
against
whose
portal
she
hath
thrown
in
childhood
many
an
idle
stone
some
tomb
from
out
whose
sounding
door
she
shall
force
an
echo
more
thrilling
to
think
poor
child
of
sin
it
was
the
dead
who
groaned
within
bridal
ballad
the
ring
is
on
my
hand
and
the
wreath
is
on
my
brow
satins
and
jewels
grand
are
all
at
my
command
and
i
am
happy
now
and
my
lord
he
loves
me
well
but
when
first
he
breathed
his
vow
i
felt
my
bosom
swell
for
the
words
rang
as
a
knell
and
the
voice
seemed
who
fell
in
the
battle
down
the
dell
and
who
is
happy
now
but
he
spoke
to
reassure
me
and
he
kissed
my
pallid
brow
while
a
reverie
came
me
and
to
the
churchyard
bore
me
and
i
sighed
to
him
before
me
thinking
him
dead
oh
i
am
happy
now
and
thus
the
words
were
spoken
and
thus
the
plighted
vow
and
though
my
faith
be
broken
and
though
my
heart
be
broken
behold
the
golden
keys
that
me
happy
now
would
to
god
i
could
awaken
for
i
dream
i
know
not
how
and
my
soul
is
sorely
shaken
lest
an
evil
step
be
taken
lest
the
dead
who
is
forsaken
may
not
be
happy
now
notes
the
raven
the
raven
was
first
published
on
the
january
in
the
new
york
mirror
a
paper
its
author
was
then
assistant
editor
of
it
was
prefaced
by
the
following
words
understood
to
have
been
written
by
willis
we
are
permitted
to
copy
in
advance
of
publication
from
the
second
number
of
the
review
the
following
remarkable
poem
by
edgar
poe
in
our
opinion
it
is
the
most
effective
single
example
of
poetry
ever
published
in
this
country
and
unsurpassed
in
english
poetry
for
subtle
conception
masterly
ingenuity
of
versification
and
consistent
sustaining
of
imaginative
lift
and
it
is
one
of
those
bred
in
a
book
which
we
feed
on
it
will
stick
to
the
memory
of
everybody
who
reads
it
in
the
february
number
of
the
review
the
poem
was
published
as
by
quarles
and
it
was
introduced
by
the
following
note
evidently
suggested
if
not
written
by
poe
himself
the
following
lines
from
a
correspondent
besides
the
deep
quaint
strain
of
the
sentiment
and
the
curious
introduction
of
some
ludicrous
touches
amidst
the
serious
and
impressive
as
was
doubtless
intended
by
the
author
appears
to
us
one
of
the
most
felicitous
specimens
of
unique
rhyming
which
has
for
some
time
met
our
eye
the
resources
of
english
rhythm
for
varieties
of
melody
measure
and
sound
producing
corresponding
diversities
of
effect
have
been
thoroughly
studied
much
more
perceived
by
very
few
poets
in
the
language
while
the
classic
tongues
especially
the
greek
possess
by
power
of
accent
several
advantages
for
versification
over
our
own
chiefly
through
greater
abundance
of
spondaic
feet
we
have
other
and
very
great
advantages
of
sound
by
the
modern
usage
of
rhyme
alliteration
is
nearly
the
only
effect
of
that
kind
which
the
ancients
had
in
common
with
us
it
will
be
seen
that
much
of
the
melody
of
raven
arises
from
alliteration
and
the
studious
use
of
similar
sounds
in
unusual
places
in
regard
to
its
measure
it
may
be
noted
that
if
all
the
verses
were
like
the
second
they
might
properly
be
placed
merely
in
short
lines
producing
a
not
uncommon
form
but
the
presence
in
all
the
others
of
one
line
mostly
the
second
in
the
verse
stanza
which
flows
continuously
with
only
an
aspirate
pause
in
the
middle
like
that
before
the
short
line
in
the
sapphio
adonic
while
the
fifth
has
at
the
middle
pause
no
similarity
of
sound
with
any
part
beside
gives
the
versification
an
entirely
different
effect
we
could
wish
the
capacities
of
our
noble
language
in
prosody
were
better
understood
ed
rev
the
bells
the
bibliographical
history
of
the
bells
is
curious
the
subject
and
some
lines
of
the
original
version
having
been
suggested
by
the
friend
shew
poe
when
he
wrote
out
the
first
draft
of
the
poem
headed
it
the

by
a

this
draft
now
the

consists
of
only
seventeen
lines
and
reads
thus
i

there
floats

in

february
the

forwarded
to

a
much
enlarged
and
altered
transcript
three
months
having
elapsed
without

another
revision
of
the
poem
similar

was
ascribed
to
him
when
first
published
it
contained
the

additional
stanza

poe
subsequently
at
the
suggestion
of

wisely
suppressed
said

to
ban
it
from
the
secret
that
lies
in
these
wolds

drawn
up
the
spectre
of

my

beats
in
coupling
those
two
words
annabel

annabel
lee
was
written
early
in

is
evidently
an
expression
of
the
poet
undying
love
for
his
deceased

at

one
of
his
lady
admirers
deemed
it
a

bloom
the
tree

stricken
eagle
soar

all
my
days
are
trances
and
all
my
nightly
dreams
are
where
thy
dark
eye
glances
and
where
thy
footstep
gleams
in
what
ethereal
dances
by
what
eternal
streams
alas
for
that
accursed

they
bore
thee
the

titled
age
and
crime
and
an
unholy
pillow
from
me
and
from
our
misty
clime
where
weeps
the
silver
willow
the
coliseum
type
of
the
antique
rome
rich
reliquary
of
lofty
contemplation
left
to
time
by
buried
centuries
of
pomp
and
power
at
length
at
length
after
so
many
days
of
weary
pilgrimage
and
burning
thirst
thirst
for
the
springs
of
lore
that
in
thee
lie
i
kneel
an
altered
and
an
humble
man
amid
thy
shadows
and
so
drink
within
my
very
soul
thy
grandeur
gloom
and
glory
vastness
and
age
and
memories
of
eld
silence
and
desolation
and
dim
night
i
feel
ye
now
i
feel
ye
in
your
strength
o
spells
more
sure
than
judæan
king
taught
in
the
gardens
of
gethsemane
o
charms
more
potent
than
the
rapt
chaldee
ever
drew
down
from
out
the
quiet
stars
here
where
a
hero
fell
a
column
falls
here
where
the
mimic
eagle
glared
in
gold
a
midnight
vigil
holds
the
swarthy
bat
here
where
the
dames
of
rome
their
gilded
hair
waved
to
the
wind
now
wave
the
reed
and
thistle
here
where
on
golden
throne
the
monarch
lolled
glides
unto
his
marble
home
lit
by
the
wan
light
of
the
horned
moon
the
swift
and
silent
lizard
of
the
stones
but
stay
these
walls
these
arcades
these
mouldering
plinths
these
sad
and
blackened
shafts
these
vague
entablatures
this
crumbling
frieze
these
shattered
cornices
this
wreck
this
ruin
these
stones
alas
these
gray
stones
are
they
all
all
of
the
famed
and
the
colossal
left
by
the
corrosive
hours
to
fate
and
me
not
all
the
echoes
answer
me
not
all
prophetic
sounds
and
loud
arise
forever
from
us
and
from
all
ruin
unto
the
wise
as
melody
from
memnon
to
the
sun
we
rule
the
hearts
of
mightiest
men
we
rule
with
a
despotic
sway
all
giant
minds
we
are
not
impotent
we
pallid
stones
not
all
our
power
is
gone
not
all
our
fame
not
all
the
magic
of
our
high
renown
not
all
the
wonder
that
encircles
us
not
all
the
mysteries
that
in
us
lie
not
all
the
memories
that
hang
upon
and
cling
around
about
us
as
a
garment
clothing
us
in
a
robe
of
more
than
glory
the
haunted
palace
in
the
greenest
of
our
valleys
by
good
angels
tenanted
once
a
fair
and
stately
palace
radiant
palace
reared
its
head
in
the
monarch
thought
dominion
it
stood
there
never
seraph
spread
a
pinion
over
fabric
half
so
fair
banners
yellow
glorious
golden
on
its
roof
did
float
and
flow
this
all
this
was
in
the
olden
time
long
ago
and
every
gentle
air
that
dallied
in
that
sweet
day
along
the
ramparts
plumed
and
pallid
a
winged
odor
went
away
wanderers
in
that
happy
valley
through
two
luminous
windows
saw
spirits
moving
musically
to
a
lute
law
bound
about
a
throne
where
sitting
porphyrogene
in
state
his
glory
well
befitting
the
ruler
of
the
realm
was
seen
and
all
with
pearl
and
ruby
glowing
was
the
fair
palace
door
through
which
came
flowing
flowing
flowing
and
sparkling
evermore
a
troop
of
echoes
whose
sweet
duty
was
but
to
sing
in
voices
of
surpassing
beauty
the
wit
and
wisdom
of
their
king
but
evil
things
in
robes
of
sorrow
assailed
the
monarch
high
estate
ah
let
us
mourn
for
never
morrow
shall
dawn
upon
him
desolate
and
round
about
his
home
the
glory
that
blushed
and
bloomed
is
but
a
story
of
the
old
time
entombed
and
travellers
now
within
that
valley
through
the
windows
see
vast
forms
that
move
fantastically
to
a
discordant
melody
while
like
a
ghastly
rapid
river
through
the
pale
door
a
hideous
throng
rush
out
forever
and
laugh
but
smile
no
more
the
conqueror
worm
lo
is
a
gala
night
within
the
lonesome
latter
years
an
angel
throng
bewinged
bedight
in
veils
and
drowned
in
tears
sit
in
a
theatre
to
see
a
play
of
hopes
and
fears
while
the
orchestra
breathes
fitfully
the
music
of
the
spheres
mimes
in
the
form
of
god
on
high
mutter
and
mumble
low
and
hither
and
thither
fly
mere
puppets
they
who
come
and
go
at
bidding
of
vast
formless
things
that
shift
the
scenery
to
and
fro
flapping
from
out
their
condor
wings
invisible
wo
that
motley
drama
oh
be
sure
it
shall
not
be
forgot
with
its
phantom
chased
for
evermore
by
a
crowd
that
seize
it
not
through
a
circle
that
ever
returneth
in
to
the
spot
and
much
of
madness
and
more
of
sin
and
horror
the
soul
of
the
plot
but
see
amid
the
mimic
rout
a
crawling
shape
intrude
a
thing
that
writhes
from
out
the
scenic
solitude
it
writhes
it
writhes
with
mortal
pangs
the
mimes
become
its
food
and
the
angels
sob
at
vermin
fangs
in
human
gore
imbued
out
out
are
the
lights
out
all
and
over
each
quivering
form
the
curtain
a
funeral
pall
comes
down
with
the
rush
of
a
storm
and
the
angels
all
pallid
and
wan
uprising
unveiling
affirm
that
the
play
is
the
tragedy
man
and
its
hero
the
conqueror
worm
silence
there
are
some
qualities
some
incorporate
things
that
have
a
double
life
which
thus
is
made
a
type
of
that
twin
entity
which
springs
from
matter
and
light
evinced
in
solid
and
shade
there
is
a
twofold
sea
and
shore
body
and
soul
one
dwells
in
lonely
places
newly
with
grass
some
solemn
graces
some
human
memories
and
tearful
lore
render
him
terrorless
his
name
no
more
he
is
the
corporate
silence
dread
him
not
no
power
hath
he
of
evil
in
himself
but
should
some
urgent
fate
untimely
lot
bring
thee
to
meet
his
shadow
nameless
elf
that
haunteth
the
lone
regions
where
hath

thyself
to

route
obscure
and
lonely
haunted
by
ill
angels
only
where
an
eidolon
named
night
on
a
black
throne
reigns
upright
i
have
reached
these
lands
but
newly
from
an
ultimate
dim
thule
from
a
wild
weird
clime
that
lieth
sublime
out
of
space
out
of
time
bottomless
vales
and
boundless
floods
and
chasms
and
caves
and
titan
woods
with
forms
that
no
man
can
discover
for
the
dews
that
drip
all
over
mountains
toppling
evermore
into
seas
without
a
shore
seas
that
restlessly
aspire
surging
unto
skies
of
fire
lakes
that
endlessly
outspread
their
lone
waters
lone
and
dead
their
still
waters
still
and
chilly
with
the
snows
of
the
lolling
lily
by
the
lakes
that
thus
outspread
their
lone
waters
lone
and
dead
their
sad
waters
sad
and
chilly
with
the
snows
of
the
lolling
lily
by
the
mountains
near
the
river
murmuring
lowly
murmuring
ever
by
the
gray
woods
by
the
swamp
where
the
toad
and
the
newt
encamp
by
the
dismal
tarns
and
pools
where
dwell
the
ghouls
by
each
spot
the
most
unholy
in
each
nook
most
melancholy
there
the
traveller
meets
aghast
sheeted
memories
of
the
past
shrouded
forms
that
start
and
sigh
as
they
pass
the
wanderer
by
forms
of
friends
long
given
in
agony
to
the
earth
and
heaven
for
the
heart
whose
woes
are
legion
is
a
peaceful
soothing
region
for
the
spirit
that
walks
in
shadow
is
oh
is
an
eldorado
but
the
traveller
travelling
through
it
may
not
dare
not
openly
view
it
never
its
mysteries
are
exposed
to
the
weak
human
eye
unclosed
so
wills
its
king
who
hath
forbid
the
uplifting
of
the
fringed
lid
and
thus
the
sad
soul
that
here
passes
beholds
it
but
through
darkened
glasses
by
a
route
obscure
and
lonely
haunted
by
ill
angels
only
where
an
eidolon
named
night
on
a
black
throne
reigns
upright
i
have
wandered

newly

the
imperial
city
what
politian
of
britain
earl
of
leicester
the
same
my
love
we
have
him
at
the
wedding
a
man
quite
young
in
years
but
gray
in
fame
i
have
not
seen
him
but
rumor
speaks
of
him
as
of
a
prodigy
in
arts
and
arms
and
wealth
and
high
descent
we
have
him
at
the
wedding
i
have
heard
much
of
this
politian
gay
volatile
and
giddy
is
he
not
and
little
given
to
thinking
far
from
it
love
no
branch
they
say
of
all
philosophy
so
deep
abstruse
he
has
not
mastered
it
learned
as
few
are
learned
is
very
strange
i
have
known
men
have
seen
politian
and
sought
his
company
they
speak
of
him
as
of
one
who
entered
madly
into
life
drinking
the
cup
of
pleasure
to
the
dregs
ridiculous
now
have
seen
politian
and
know
him
well
nor
learned
nor
mirthful
he
he
is
a
dreamer
and
shut
out
from
common
passions
children
we
disagree
let
us
go
forth
and
taste
the
fragrant
air
of
the
garden
did
i
dream
or
did
i
hear
politian
was
a
man
ii
a
lady
apartment
with
a
window
open
and
looking
into
a
garden
lalage
in
deep
mourning
reading
at
a
table
on
which
lie
some
books
and
a
in
the
background
jacinta
a
servant
maid
leans
carelessly
upon
a
chair
jacinta
is
it
thou
yes
i
here
i
did
not
know
jacinta
you
were
in
waiting
sit
down
let
not
my
presence
trouble
you
sit
down
for
i
am
humble
most
humble
is
time
seats
herself
in
a
manner
upon
the
chair
resting
her
elbows
upon
the
back
and
regarding
her
mistress
with
a
contemptuous
look
lalage
continues
to
it
in
another
climate
so
he
said
bore
a
bright
golden
flower
but
not
i
this
soil
turns
over
some
leaves
and
no
lingering
winters
there
nor
snow
nor
shower
but
ocean
ever
to
refresh
mankind
breathes
the
shrill
spirit
of
the
western
wind
oh
beautiful
most
beautiful
how
like
to
what
my
fevered
soul
doth
dream
of
heaven
o
happy
land
she
died
the
maiden
died
o
still
more
happy
maiden
who
couldst
die
jacinta
returns
no
answer
and
lalage
presently
again
a
similar
tale
told
of
a
beauteous
dame
beyond
the
sea
thus
speaketh
one
ferdinand
in
the
words
of
the
play
she
died
full
young
one
bossola
answers
him
i
think
not
so
her
infelicity
seemed
to
have
years
too
many
ah
luckless
lady
jacinta
no
here
a
far
sterner
story
but
like
oh
very
like
in
its
despair
of
that
egyptian
queen
winning
so
easily
a
thousand
hearts
losing
at
length
her
own
she
died
thus
endeth
the
history
and
her
maids
lean
over
her
and
keep
two
gentle
maids
with
gentle
names
eiros
and
charmion
rainbow
and
dove
jacinta
madam
what
is
it
wilt
thou
my
good
jacinta
be
so
kind
as
go
down
in
the
library
and
bring
me
the
holy
evangelists
pshaw
if
there
be
balm
for
the
wounded
spirit
in
gilead
it
is
there
dew
in
the
night
time
of
my
bitter
trouble
will
there
be
found
dew
sweeter
far
than
that
which
hangs
like
chains
of
pearl
on
hermon
hill
jacinta
and
throws
a
volume
on
the
there

mockery

most
cruel

thus
thy
bitter
tears
will
madden

here
thine
eyes
thou
askest
me
if
i
could
speak
of
love
knowing
what
i
know
and
seeing
what
i
have
seen
thou
askest
me
that
and
thus
i
answer
thee
thus
on
my
bended
knee
i
answer
thee
sweet
lalage

thro
good
and
ill
thro
weal
and
woe

her
on

with
intenser
love
than
i
for
thee
not
on

in
any
time
or
clime
burned
there
a
holier
fire
than
burneth
now
within
my
spirit
for
and
do
i
love
even
for
thy
woes
i
love
thee
even
for
thy
woes
thy
beauty
and
thy
woes
alas
proud
earl
thou
dost
forget
thyself
remembering
me
how
in
thy
father
halls
among
the
maidens
pure
and
reproachless
of
thy
princely
line
could
the
dishonored
lalage
abide
thy
wife
and
with
a
tainted
memory
my
seared
and
blighted
name
how
would
it
tally
with
the
ancestral
honors
of
thy
house
and
with
thy
glory
speak
not
to
me
of
glory
i
hate
i
loathe
the
name
i
do
abhor
the
unsatisfactory
and
ideal
thing
art
thou
not
lalage
and
i
politian
do
i
not
love
art
thou
not
beautiful
what
need
we
more
ha
glory
now
speak
not
of
it
by
all
i
hold
most
sacred
and
most
solemn
by
all
my
wishes
now
my
fears
hereafter
by
all
i
scorn
on
earth
and
hope
in
heaven
there
is
no
deed
i
would
more
glory
in
than
in
thy
cause
to
scoff
at
this
same
glory
and
trample
it
under
foot
what
matters
it
what
matters
it
my
fairest
and
my
best
that
we
go
down
unhonored
and
forgotten
into
the
dust
so
we
descend
together
descend
together
and
then
and
then
perchance
why
dost
thou
pause
politian
and
then
perchance
together
lalage
and
roam
the
starry
and
quiet
dwellings
of
the
blest
and
still
why
dost
thou
pause
politian
and
still
now
earl
of
leicester
thou
me
and
in
my
heart
of
hearts
i
feel
thou
lovest
me
truly
o
lalage
himself
upon
his
and
lovest
thou
hist
hush
within
the
gloom
of
yonder
trees
methought
a
figure
passed
a
spectral
figure
solemn
and
slow
and
noiseless
like
the
grim
shadow
conscience
solemn
and
noiseless
across
and
i
was
mistaken
was
but
a
giant
bough
stirred
by
the
autumn
wind
politian
my
lalage
my
love
why
art
thou
moved
why
dost
thou
turn
so
pale
not
conscience
self
far
less
a
shadow
which
thou
likenest
to
it
should
shake
the
firm
spirit
thus
but
the
night
wind
is
chilly
and
these
melancholy
boughs
throw
over
all
things
a
gloom
politian
thou
speakest
to
me
of
love
knowest
thou
the
land
with
which
all
tongues
are
busy
a
land
new
found
miraculously
found
by
one
of
genoa
a
thousand
leagues
within
the
golden
west
a
fairy
land
of
flowers
and
fruit
and
sunshine
and
crystal
lakes
and
forests
and
mountains
around
whose
towering
summits
the
winds
of
heaven
untrammelled
flow
which
air
to
breathe
is
happiness
now
and
will
be
freedom
hereafter
in
days
that
are
to
come
oh
wilt
thou
wilt
thou
fly
to
that
paradise
my
lalage
wilt
thou
fly
thither
with
me
there
care
shall
be
forgotten
and
sorrow
shall
be
no
more
and
eros
be
all
and
life
shall
then
be
mine
for
i
will
live
for
thee
and
in
thine
eyes
and
thou
shalt
be
no
more
a
mourner
but
the
radiant
joys
shall
wait
upon
thee
and
the
angel
hope
attend
thee
ever
and
i
will
kneel
to
thee
and
worship
thee
and
call
thee
my
beloved
my
own
my
beautiful
my
love
my
wife
my
all
oh
wilt
thou
wilt
thou
lalage
fly
thither
with
me
a
deed

to
be
done

words

i
what
was
it
he
said
politian

thou
art
not
politian
i
thou
art
not
gone
yet
dare
not
look
lest
i
behold
thee
not
thou
not
go
with
those
words
upon
thy
lips
oh
speak
to
me
and
let
me
hear
thy
voice
one
word
one
word
to
say
thou
art
not
gone
one
little
sentence
to
say
how
thou
dost
scorn
how
thou
dost
hate
my
womanly
weakness
ha
ha
thou
not
gone
oh
speak
to
me
i
thou
wouldst
not
go
i
knew
thou
wouldst
not
couldst
not
not
go
villain
thou
not
gone
thou
mockest
me
and
thus
i
clutch
thee
thus
he
is
gone
he
is
gone
gone
gone
where
am
i
is
well
is
very
well
so
that
the
blade
be
keen
the
blow
be
sure
is
well
is
well
alas
alas
the
suburbs
politian
alone
this
weakness
grows
upon
me
i
am
fain
and
much
i
fear
me
ill
it
will
not
do
to
die
ere
i
have
lived
stay
stay
thy
hand
o
azrael
yet
awhile
prince
of
the
powers
of
darkness
and
the
tomb
oh
pity

oh
pity

let
me
not
perish
now
in
the
budding
of
my
paradisal
hope
give
me
to
live
yet
yet
a
little
while
is
i
who
pray
for
life
i
who
so
late
demanded
but
to
die
what
sayeth
the
count
that
knowing
no
cause
of
quarrel
or
of
feud
between
the
earl
politian
and
himself
he
doth
decline
your
cartel
didst
thou
say
what
answer
was
it
you
brought
me
good
baldazzar
with
what
excessive
fragrance
the
zephyr
comes
laden
from
yonder
bowers
a
fairer
day
or
one
more
worthy
italy
methinks
no
mortal
eyes
have
seen
said
the
count
that
he
castiglione
not
being
aware
of
any
feud
existing
or
any
cause
of
quarrel
between
your
lordship
and
himself
can
not
accept
the
challenge
it
is
most
true
all
this
is
very
true
when
saw
you
sir
when
saw
you
now
baldazzar
in
the
frigid
ungenial
britain
which
we
left
so
lately
a
heaven
so
calm
as
this
so
utterly
free
from
the
evil
taint
of
clouds
and
he
did
no
more
my
lord
than
i
have
told
you
the
count
castiglione
will
not
fight
having
no
cause
for
quarrel
now
this
is
true
all
very
true
thou
art
my
friend
baldazzar
and
i
have
not
forgotten
it
do
me
a
piece
of
service
wilt
thou
go
back
and
say
unto
this

some
strange
some
singular
mistake
misunderstanding

hast
been
urged
thereby
in
heat
of
anger

some
words
most
unaccountable
in

to
me
castiglione
the
bearer
being
baldazzar
duke

i
am
aware
of
nothing
which

footnote
by
sir
thomas
ed
note
on
politian
such
portions
of
politian
as
are
known
to
the
public
first
saw
the
light
of
publicity
in
the
literary
messenger
for
december
and
january
being
styled
scenes
from
politian
an
unpublished
drama
these
scenes
were
included
unaltered
in
the
collection
of
poems
by
poe
the
larger
portion
of
the
original
draft
subsequently
became
the
property
of
the
present
editor
but
it
is
not
considered
just
to
the
poet
memory
to
publish
it
the
work
is
a
hasty
and
unrevised
production
of
its
author
earlier
days
of
literary
labor
and
beyond
the
scenes
already
known
scarcely
calculated
to
enhance
his
reputation
as
a
specimen
however
of
the
parts
unpublished
the
following
fragment
from
the
first
scene
of
act
ii
may
be
offered
the
duke
it
should
be
premised
is
uncle
to
alessandra
and
father
of
castiglione
her
betrothed
why
do
you
laugh
indeed
i
hardly
know
myself
stay
was
it
not
on
yesterday
we
were
speaking
of
the
earl
of
the
earl
politian
yes
it
was
yesterday
alessandra
you
and
i
you
must
remember
we
were
walking
in
the
garden
perfectly
i
do
remember
it
what
of
it
what
then
o
nothing
nothing
at
all
nothing
at
all
it
is
most
singular
that
you
should
laugh
at
nothing
at
all
most
singular
singular
look
yon
castiglione
be
so
kind
as
tell
me
sir
at
once
what
is
you
mean
what
are
you
talking
of
was
it
not
so
we
differed
in
opinion
touching
him
him
whom
why
sir
the
earl
politian
the
earl
of
leicester
yes
is
it
he
you
mean
we
differed
indeed
if
i
now
recollect
the
words
you
used
were
that
the
earl
you
knew
was
neither
learned
nor
mirthful
ha
ha
now
did
i
that
did
you
sir
and
well
i
knew
at
the
time
you
were
wrong
it
being
not
the
character
of
the
earl
whom
all
the
world
allows
to
be
a
most
hilarious
man
be
not
my
son
too
positive
again
is
singular
most
singular
i
could
not
think
it
possible
so
little
time
could
so
much
alter
one
to
say
the
truth
about
an
hour
ago
as
i
was
walking
with
the
count
san
ozzo
all
arm
in
arm
we
met
this
very
man
the
earl
he
with
his
friend
baldazzar
having
just
arrived
in
rome
ha
ha
he
altered
such
an
account
he
gave
me
of
his
journey
have
made
you
die
with
laughter
such
tales
he
told
of
his
caprices
and
his
merry
freaks
along
the
road
such
oddity
such
humor
such
wit
such
whim
such
flashes
of
wild
merriment
set
off
too
in
such
full
relief
by
the
grave
demeanor
of
his
friend
who
to
speak
the
truth
was
gravity
itself
did
i
not
tell
you
you
did
and
yet
is
strange
but
true
as
strange
how
much
i
was
mistaken
i
always
thought
the
earl
a
gloomy
man
so
so
you
see
be
not
too
positive
whom
have
we
here
it
can
not
be
the
earl
the
earl
oh
no
tis
not
the
earl
but
yet
it
is
and
leaning
upon
his
friend
baldazzar
ah
welcome
sir
politian
and
my
lord
a
second
welcome
let
me
give
you
to
rome

grace

of
leicester

your
grace

most
welcome

cousin
hither
and
let
me
make
the
noble
earl
acquainted
with
your
betrothed

come
sir
at
a
time
most
seasonable
the
wedding
touching
those
letters
sir
your
son
made
mention
of
your
son
is
he
not
touching
those
letters
sir
i
wot
not
of
them
if
such
there
be
my
friend
baldazzar
here
baldazzar
ah
my
friend
baldazzar

his
lordship

unwell
this
way
my
lord
followed
by
retire
unwell
so
please
you
sir
i
fear
me
is
as
you
say
his
lordship
is
unwell
the
damp
air
of
the
evening
the
fatigue
of
a
long
journey
the
indeed
i
had
better
follow
his
lordship
he
must
be
unwell
i
will
return
anon
return
anon
now
this
is
very
strange
castiglione
this
way
my
son
i
wish
to
speak
with
thee
you
surely
were
mistaken
in
what
you
said
of
the
earl
mirthful
indeed
which
of
us
said
politian
was
a
melancholy
man
poems
of
youth
introduction
to
letter
to
b
west
point
dear
b
believing
only
a
portion
of
my
former
volume
to
be
worthy
a
second
edition
that
small
portion
i
thought
it
as
well
to
include
in
the
present
book
as
to
republish
by
itself
i
have
therefore
herein
combined
aaraaf
and
with
other
poems
hitherto
unprinted
nor
have
i
hesitated
to
insert
from
the
poems
now
omitted
whole
lines
and
even
passages
to
the
end
that
being
placed
in
a
fairer
light
and
the
trash
shaken
from
them
in
which
they
were
imbedded
they
may
have
some
chance
of
being
seen
by
posterity
it
has
been
said
that
a
good
critique
on
a
poem
may
be
written
by
one
who
is
no
poet
himself
this
according
to
idea
and
of
poetry
i
feel
to
be
false
the
less
poetical
the
critic
the
less
just
the
critique
and
the
converse
on
this
account
and
because
there
are
but
few
b
s
in
the
world
i
would
be
as
much
ashamed
of
the
good
opinion
as
proud
of
your
own
another
than
yourself
might
here
observe
is
in
possession
of
the
world
good
opinion
and
yet
shakespeare
is
the
greatest
of
poets
it
appears
then
that
the
world
judge
correctly
why
should
you
be
ashamed
of
their
favorable
judgment
the
difficulty
lies
in
the
interpretation
of
the
word
or
the
opinion
is
the
world
truly
but
it
may
be
called
theirs
as
a
man
would
call
a
book
his
having
bought
it
he
did
not
write
the
book
but
it
is
his
they
did
not
originate
the
opinion
but
it
is
theirs
a
fool
for
example
thinks
shakespeare
a
great
poet
yet
the
fool
has
never
read
shakespeare
but
the
fool
neighbor
who
is
a
step
higher
on
the
andes
of
the
mind
whose
head
that
is
to
say
his
more
exalted
thought
is
too
far
above
the
fool
to
be
seen
or
understood
but
whose
feet
by
which
i
mean
his
actions
are
sufficiently
near
to
be
discerned
and
by
means
of
which
that
superiority
is
ascertained
which
for
them
would
never
have
been
discovered
this
neighbor
asserts
that
shakespeare
is
a
great
poet
the
fool
believes
him
and
it
is
henceforward
his
this
own
opinion
has
in
like
manner
been
adopted
from
one
above
and
so
ascendingly
to
a
few
gifted
individuals
who
kneel
around
the
summit
beholding
face
to
face
the
master
spirit
who
stands
upon
the
pinnacle
you
are
aware
of
the
great
barrier
in
the
path
of
an
american
writer
he
is
read
if
at
all
in
preference
to
the
combined
and
established
wit
of
the
world
i
say
established
for
it
is
with
literature
as
with
law
or
empire
an
established
name
is
an
estate
in
tenure
or
a
throne
in
possession
besides
one
might
suppose
that
books
like
their
authors
improve
by
travel
their
having
crossed
the
sea
is
with
us
so
great
a
distinction
our
antiquaries
abandon
time
for
distance
our
very
fops
glance
from
the
binding
to
the
bottom
of
the
where
the
mystic
characters
which
spell
london
paris
or
genoa
are
precisely
so
many
letters
of
recommendation
i
mentioned
just
now
a
vulgar
error
as
regards
criticism
i
think
the
notion
that
no
poet
can
form
a
correct
estimate
of
his
own
writings
is
another
i
remarked
before
that
in
proportion
to
the
poetical
talent
would
be
the
justice
of
a
critique
upon
poetry
therefore
a
bad
poet
would
i
grant
make
a
false
critique
and
his
would
infallibly
bias
his
little
judgment
in
his
favor
but
a
poet
who
is
indeed
a
poet
could
not
i
think
fail
of
making
a
just
critique
whatever
should
be
deducted
on
the
score
of
might
be
replaced
on
account
of
his
intimate
acquaintance
with
the
subject
in
short
we
have
more
instances
of
false
criticism
than
of
just
where
one
own
writings
are
the
test
simply
because
we
have
more
bad
poets
than
good
there
are
of
course
many
objections
to
what
i
say
milton
is
a
great
example
of
the
contrary
but
his
opinion
with
respect
to
the
regained
is
by
no
means
fairly
ascertained
by
what
trivial
circumstances
men
are
often
led
to
assert
what
they
do
not
really
believe
perhaps
an
inadvertent
word
has
descended
to
posterity
but
in
fact
the
regained
is
little
if
at
all
inferior
to
the
lost
and
is
only
supposed
so
to
be
because
men
do
not
like
epics
whatever
they
may
say
to
the
contrary
and
reading
those
of
milton
in
their
natural
order
are
too
much
wearied
with
the
first
to
derive
any
pleasure
from
the
second
i
dare
say
milton
preferred
to
either
if
so
justly
as
i
am
speaking
of
poetry
it
will
not
be
amiss
to
touch
slightly
upon
the
most
singular
heresy
in
its
modern
history
the
heresy
of
what
is
called
very
foolishly
the
lake
school
some
years
ago
i
might
have
been
induced
by
an
occasion
like
the
present
to
attempt
a
formal
refutation
of
their
doctrine
at
present
it
would
be
a
work
of
supererogation
the
wise
must
bow
to
the
wisdom
of
such
men
as
coleridge
and
southey
but
being
wise
have
laughed
at
poetical
theories
so
prosaically
exemplified
aristotle
with
singular
assurance
has
declared
poetry
the
most
philosophical
of
all
writings
but
it
required
a
wordsworth
to
pronounce
it
the
most
metaphysical
he
seems
to
think
that
the
end
of
poetry
is
or
should
be
instruction
yet
it
is
a
truism
that
the
end
of
our
existence
is
happiness
if
so
the
end
of
every
separate
part
of
our
existence
everything
connected
with
our
existence
should
be
still
happiness
therefore
the
end
of
instruction
should
be
happiness
and
happiness
is
another
name
for
pleasure
therefore
the
end
of
instruction
should
be
pleasure
yet
we
see
the
opinion
implies
precisely
the
reverse
to
proceed
he
who
pleases
is
of
more
importance
to
his
than
he
who
instructs
since
utility
is
happiness
and
pleasure
is
the
end
already
obtained
which
instruction
is
merely
the
means
of
obtaining
i
see
no
reason
then
why
our
metaphysical
poets
should
plume
themselves
so
much
on
the
utility
of
their
works
unless
indeed
they
refer
to
instruction
with
eternity
in
view
in
which
case
sincere
respect
for
their
piety
would
not
allow
me
to
express
my
contempt
for
their
judgment
contempt
which
it
would
be
difficult
to
conceal
since
their
writings
are
professedly
to
be
understood
by
the
few
and
it
is
the
many
who
stand
in
need
of
salvation
in
such
case
i
should
no
doubt
be
tempted
to
think
of
the
devil
in
who
labors
indefatigably
through
three
octavo
volumes
to
accomplish
the
destruction
of
one
or
two
souls
while
any
common
devil
would
have
demolished
one
or
two
thousand
against
the
subtleties
which
would
make
poetry
a
study
not
a
passion
it
becomes
the
metaphysician
to
reason
but
the
poet
to
protest
yet
wordsworth
and
coleridge
are
men
in
years
the
one
imbued
in
contemplation
from
his
childhood
the
other
a
giant
in
intellect
and
learning
the
diffidence
then
with
which
i
venture
to
dispute
their
authority
would
be
overwhelming
did
i
not
feel
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
that
learning
has
little
to
do
with
the
imagination
intellect
with
the
passions
or
age
with
poetry
like
straws
upon
the
surface
flow
he
who
would
search
for
pearls
must
dive
below
are
lines
which
have
done
much
mischief
as
regards
the
greater
truths
men
oftener
err
by
seeking
them
at
the
bottom
than
at
the
top
truth
lies
in
the
huge
abysses
where
wisdom
is
sought
not
in
the
palpable
palaces
where
she
is
found
the
ancients
were
not
always
right
in
hiding
the
goddess
in
a
well
witness
the
light
which
bacon
has
thrown
upon
philosophy
witness
the
principles
of
our
divine
faith
that
moral
mechanism
by
which
the
simplicity
of
a
child
may
overbalance
the
wisdom
of
a
man
we
see
an
instance
of
coleridge
liability
to
err
in
his
literaria
professedly
his
literary
life
and
opinions
but
in
fact
a
treatise
omni
scibili
et
quibusdam
aliis
he
goes
wrong
by
reason
of
his
very
profundity
and
of
his
error
we
have
a
natural
type
in
the
contemplation
of
a
star
he
who
regards
it
directly
and
intensely
sees
it
is
true
the
star
but
it
is
the
star
without
a
ray
while
he
who
surveys
it
less
inquisitively
is
conscious
of
all
for
which
the
star
is
useful
to
us
below
its
brilliancy
and
its
beauty
as
to
wordsworth
i
have
no
faith
in
him
that
he
had
in
youth
the
feelings
of
a
poet
i
believe
for
there
are
glimpses
of
extreme
delicacy
in
his
writings
and
delicacy
is
the
poet
own
kingdom
his
dorado
but
they
have
the
appearance
of
a
better
day
recollected
and
glimpses
at
best
are
little
evidence
of
present
poetic
fire
we
know
that
a
few
straggling
flowers
spring
up
daily
in
the
crevices
of
the
glacier
he
was
to
blame
in
wearing
away
his
youth
in
contemplation
with
the
end
of
poetizing
in
his
manhood
with
the
increase
of
his
judgment
the
light
which
should
make
it
apparent
has
faded
away
his
judgment
consequently
is
too
correct
this
may
not
be
understood
but
the
old
goths
of
germany
would
have
understood
it
who
used
to
debate
matters
of
importance
to
their
state
twice
once
when
drunk
and
once
when
sober
sober
that
they
might
not
be
deficient
in
formality
drunk
lest
they
should
be
destitute
of
vigor
the
long
wordy
discussions
by
which
he
tries
to
reason
us
into
admiration
of
his
poetry
speak
very
little
in
his
favor
they
are
full
of
such
assertions
as
this
i
have
opened
one
of
his
volumes
at
random
genius
the
only
proof
is
the
act
of
doing
well
what
is
worthy
to
be
done
and
what
was
never
done
before
indeed
then
it
follows
that
in
doing
what
is
to
be
done
or
what
been
done
before
no
genius
can
be
evinced
yet
the
picking
of
pockets
is
an
unworthy
act
pockets
have
been
picked
time
immemorial
and
barrington
the
in
point
of
genius
would
have
thought
hard
of
a
comparison
with
william
wordsworth
the
poet
again
in
estimating
the
merit
of
certain
poems
whether
they
be
ossian
or
macpherson
can
surely
be
of
little
consequence
yet
in
order
to
prove
their
worthlessness
has
expended
many
pages
in
the
controversy
animis
can
great
minds
descend
to
such
absurdity
but
worse
still
that
he
may
bear
down
every
argument
in
favor
of
these
poems
he
triumphantly
drags
forward
a
passage
in
his
abomination
with
which
he
expects
the
reader
to
sympathise
it
is
the
beginning
of
the
epic
poem
blue
waves
of
ullin
roll
in
light
the
green
hills
are
covered
with
day
trees
shake
their
dusty
heads
in
the
breeze
and
this
this
gorgeous
yet
simple
imagery
where
all
is
alive
and
panting
with
immortality
this
william
wordsworth
the
author
of
bell
has
for
his
contempt
we
shall
see
what
better
he
in
his
own
person
has
to
offer
imprimis
now
she
at
the
pony
tail
and
now
she
at
the
pony
head
on
that
side
now
and
now
on
this
and
almost
stifled
with
her
bliss
a
few
sad
tears
does
betty
shed
she
pats
the
pony
where
or
when
she
knows
not
happy
betty
foy
oh
johnny
never
mind
the
doctor
secondly
dew
was
falling
fast
the
stars
began
to
blink
i
heard
a
voice
it
said
drink
pretty
creature
drink
and
looking
the
hedge
before
me
i
espied
a
mountain
lamb
with
a
maiden
at
its
side
no
other
sheep
was
near
the
lamb
was
all
alone
and
by
a
slender
cord
was
tether
to
a
stone
now
we
have
no
doubt
this
is
all
true
we
believe
it
indeed
we
will
mr
is
it
sympathy
for
the
sheep
you
wish
to
excite
i
love
a
sheep
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
but
there
are
occasions
dear
b
there
are
occasions
when
even
wordsworth
is
reasonable
even
stamboul
it
is
said
shall
have
an
end
and
the
most
unlucky
blunders
must
come
to
a
conclusion
here
is
an
extract
from
his
preface
who
have
been
accustomed
to
the
phraseology
of
modern
writers
if
they
persist
in
reading
this
book
to
a
conclusion
will
no
doubt
have
to
struggle
with
feelings
of
awkwardness
ha
ha
ha
they
will
look
round
for
poetry
ha
ha
ha
ha
and
will
be
induced
to
inquire
by
what
species
of
courtesy
these
attempts
have
been
permitted
to
assume
that
title
ha
ha
ha
ha
ha
yet
let
not
despair
he
has
given
immortality
to
a
wagon
and
the
bee
sophocles
has
transmitted
to
eternity
a
sore
toe
and
dignified
a
tragedy
with
a
chorus
of
turkeys
of
coleridge
i
can
not
speak
but
with
reverence
his
towering
intellect
his
gigantic
power
to
use
an
author
quoted
by
himself
trouvé
souvent
que
la
plupart
des
sectes
ont
raison
dans
une
bonne
partie
de
ce
avancent
mais
non
pas
en
ce
and
to
employ
his
own
language
he
has
imprisoned
his
own
conceptions
by
the
barrier
he
has
erected
against
those
of
others
it
is
lamentable
to
think
that
such
a
mind
should
be
buried
in
metaphysics
and
like
the
nyctanthes
waste
its
perfume
upon
the
night
alone
in
reading
that
man
poetry
i
tremble
like
one
who
stands
upon
a
volcano
conscious
from
the
very
darkness
bursting
from
the
crater
of
the
fire
and
the
light
that
are
weltering
below
what
is
poetry
poetry
that
idea
with
as
many
appellations
as
the
corcyra
me
i
demanded
of
a
scholar
some
time
ago
me
a
definition
of
poetry
and
he
proceeded
to
his
library
brought
me
a
johnson
and
overwhelmed
me
with
a
definition
shade
of
the
immortal
shakespeare
i
imagine
to
myself
the
scowl
of
your
spiritual
eye
upon
the
profanity
of
that
scurrilous
ursa
major
think
of
poetry
dear
b
think
of
poetry
and
then
think
of
samuel
johnson
think
of
all
that
is
airy
and
and
then
of
all
that
is
hideous
and
unwieldy
think
of
his
huge
bulk
the
elephant
and
then
and
then
think
of
the
the
night
dream
prospero
oberon
and
titania
a
poem
in
my
opinion
is
opposed
to
a
work
of
science
by
having
for
its
object
pleasure
not
truth
to
romance
by
having
for
its
object
an
instead
of
a
pleasure
being
a
poem
only
so
far
as
this
object
is
attained
romance

perceptible
images
with
definite
poetry
with
sensations

which
end
music
is
an
since
the
comprehension
of
sweet
sound
is
our
most
indefinite
conception
music
when
combined
with
a
pleasurable
idea
is
poetry
music
without
the
idea
is
simply
music
the
idea
without
the
music
is
prose
from
its
very
definitiveness
what
was
meant
by
the
invective
against
him
who
had
no
music
in
his
soul
to
sum
up
this
long
rigmarole

what
you
no
doubt
perceive
for
the
metaphysical
poets
as
poets
the
most
sovereign
contempt
that
they

time
for

for
there
her
world
lay
lolling
on
the
golden
air
near
four
bright
suns
a
temporary
rest
an
oasis
in
desert
of
the

away

the
soul
that

its

eminence
to
distant
spheres
from

to

she
rode
and
late
to
ours
the
favour
one
of

but
now
the
ruler
of
an
anchor
realm
she
throws
aside
the
sceptre
leaves
the
helm
and
amid
incense
and
high
spiritual
hymns
laves
in
quadruple
light
her
angel
limbs
now
happiest
loveliest
in
yon
lovely
earth
whence
sprang
the
idea
of
beauty
into
birth
falling
in
wreaths
thro
many
a
startled
star
like
woman
hair
pearls
until
afar
it
lit
on
hills
achaian
and
there
dwelt
she
look
into
infinity
and
knelt
rich
clouds
for
canopies
about
her
curled
fit
emblems
of
the
model
of
her
world
seen
but
in
beauty
not
impeding
sight
of
other
beauty
glittering
thro
the
light
a
wreath
that
twined
each
starry
form
around
and
all
the
opal
air
in
color
bound
all
hurriedly
she
knelt
upon
a
bed
of
flowers
of
lilies
such
as
rear
the
head
on
the
fair
capo
deucato
and
sprang
so
eagerly
around
about
to
hang
upon
the
flying
footsteps
of
deep
pride
of
her
who
lov
a
mortal
and
so
died
the
sephalica
budding
with
young
bees
uprear
its
purple
stem
around
her
knees
and
gemmy
flower
of
trebizond
misnam
inmate
of
highest
stars
where
erst
it
all
other
loveliness
its
honied
dew
the
fabled
nectar
that
the
heathen
knew
deliriously
sweet
was
dropp
from
heaven
and
fell
on
gardens
of
the
unforgiven
in
trebizond
and
on
a
sunny
flower
so
like
its
own
above
that
to
this
hour
it
still
remaineth
torturing
the
bee
with
madness
and
unwonted
reverie
in
heaven
and
all
its
environs
the
leaf
and
blossom
of
the
fairy
plant
in
grief
disconsolate
linger
grief
that
hangs
her
head
repenting
follies
that
full
long
have
fled
heaving
her
white
breast
to
the
balmy
air

beauty

and
more

as
sacred
as
the

fears
to
perfume
perfuming
the
night
and

pondering
between

a

while
pettish
tears
adown
her
petals
run
and
that
aspiring
flower
that
sprang
on
earth
and
died
ere
scarce
exalted
into
birth
bursting
its
odorous
heart
in
spirit
to
wing
its
way
to

from

of

abash
amid

fervor
of
his
eye
for

trembled
at
the
deity
she
stirr
not
breath
not
for
a
voice
was
there
how
solemnly
pervading
the
calm
air
a
sound
of
silence
on
the
startled
ear
which
dreamy
poets
name
the
music
of
the
sphere
ours
is
a
world
of
words
quiet
we
call
silence
which
is
the
merest
word
of
all
all
nature
speaks
and
ideal
things
flap
shadowy
sounds
from
the
visionary
wings
but
ah
not
so
when
thus
in
realms
on
high
the
eternal
voice
of
god
is
passing
by
and
the
red
winds
are
withering
in
the
sky
what
tho
in
worlds
which
sightless
cycles
run
link
to
a
little
system
and
one
sun
where
all
my
love
is
folly
and
the
crowd
still
think
my
terrors
but
the
thunder
cloud
the
storm
the
earthquake
and
the
ah
will
they
cross
me
in
my
angrier
path
what
tho
in
worlds
which
own
a

sun
the
sands
of
time
grow
dimmer
as
they
run
yet
thine
is
my
resplendency
so
given
to
bear
my
secrets
thro
the
upper
heaven
leave
tenantless
thy
crystal
home
and
fly
with
all
thy
train
athwart
the
moony
sky
apart
like
in
sicilian
night
and
wing
to
other
worlds
another
light
divulge
the
secrets
of
thy
embassy
to
the
proud
orbs
that
twinkle
and
so
be
to
heart
a
barrier
and
a
ban
lest
the
stars
totter
in
the
guilt
of
man
up

the
maiden
in

yellow
night

eve
earth
we
plight
our
faith
to
one

adore
the
of
young
beauty
had
no
more
as
sprang
that
yellow
star
from
downy
hours
up
rose
the
maiden
from
her
shrine
of
flowers
and
bent
sheeny
mountain
and

plain
her
way
but
left
not
yet
her
therasæan
reign
part
ii
high
on

of

head
such
as
the
drowsy
shepherd
on

of

pasturage
lying
at
his
ease
raising
his
heavy
eyelid
starts
and
sees
with
many
a
mutter
hope
to
be
forgiven
what
time
the
moon
is
quadrated
in
heaven
of
rosy
head
that
towering
far
away
into
the
sunlit
ether
caught
the
ray
of
sunken
suns
at
eve
at
noon
of
night
while
the
moon
danc
with
the
fair
stranger
light
uprear
upon
such
height
arose
a
pile
of
gorgeous
columns
on
th
uuburthen
air
flashing
from
parian
marble
that
twin
smile
far
down
upon
the
wave
that
sparkled
there
and
nursled
the
young
mountain
in
its
lair
of
molten
stars
their
pavement
such
as
fall
thro
the
ebon
air
besilvering
the
pall
of
their
own
dissolution
while
they
die
adorning
then
the
dwellings
of
the
sky
a
dome
by
linked
light
from
heaven
let
down
sat
gently
on
these
columns
as
a
crown
a
window
of
one
circular
diamond
there

out

into
the
purple

rays
from

shot
down

all

flapp
his
dusky

on

long

that
clung
around

burst
beneath

heaving
of

breathe

paus
and
panted
zanthe
all
beneath
the
fairy
light
that
kiss
her
golden
hair
and
long
to
rest
yet
could
but
sparkle
there
young
flowers
were
whispering
in
melody
to
happy
flowers
that
night
and
tree
to
tree
fountains
were
gushing
music
as
they
fell
in
many
a
grove

dell
yet
silence
came
upon
material
things
fair
flowers
bright
waterfalls
and
angel
wings
and
sound
alone
that
from
the
spirit
sprang
bore
burthen
to
the
charm
the
maiden
sang
neath
or
streamer
or
tufted
wild
spray
that
keeps
from
the
dreamer
the
moonbeam
away
bright
beings
that
ponder
with
eyes
on
the
stars
which
your
wonder
hath
drawn
from
the
skies
till
they
glance
thro
the
shade
and
come
down
to
your

maiden

in
violet
bowers

duty
beseeming
these
hours

shake
from
your

with
dew
the
breath
of
those
kisses
that
cumber
them
too
o
how
without

love
could
angels
be
blest
those
kisses

true
love
that
lull
ye
to

up

from

the
dew
of

night

would
weigh
down
your

on

on

one
whose
harshest
idea
will
to

run
o
is
it
thy
will
on
the
breezes
to
toss
or
capriciously
still
like
the
lone
albatross
incumbent
on

on
the
air

keep
watch
with
delight
on
the
harmony
there
ligeia

sever
thy

from
thee

many
eyes
in

sleep

the
strains
still
arise
which

keep
the

of
the
rain

leaps
down

ianthe
dearest
see
how
dim
that
ray
how
lovely
is
to
look
so
far
away
she
seemed
not
thus
upon
that
autumn
eve
i
left
her
gorgeous
halls
nor
mourned
to
leave
that
eve
that
eve
i
should
remember
well
the
dropped
in
lemnos
with
a
spell
on
th
arabesque
carving
of
a
gilded
hall
wherein
i
sate
and
on
the
draperied
wall
and
on
my
eyelids
o
the
heavy
light
how
drowsily
it
weighed
them
into
night
on
flowers
before
and
mist
and
love
they
ran
with
persian
saadi
in
his
gulistan
but
o
that
light
i
slumbered
death
the
while
stole
my
senses
in
that
lovely
isle
so
softly
that
no
single
silken
hair
awoke
that
slept
or
knew
that
he
was
there
the
last
spot
of
earth
orb
i
trod
upon
was
a
proud
temple
called
the
parthenon
more
beauty
clung
around
her
columned
wall
then
even
thy
glowing
bosom
beats
withal
and
when
old
time
my
wing
did
disenthral
thence
sprang
i
as
the
eagle
from
his
tower
and
years
i
left
behind
me
in
an
hour
what
time
upon
her
airy
bounds
i
hung
one
half
the
garden
of
her
globe
was
flung
unrolling
as
a
chart
unto
my
view
tenantless
cities
of
the
desert
too
ianthe
beauty
crowded
on
me
then
and
half
i
wished
to
be
again
of
men
my
angelo
and
why
of
them
to
be
a
brighter
is
here
for
thee
and
greener
fields

in
yon
world
above
and
woman
loveliness
and
passionate
love
but
list
ianthe
when
the
air
so
soft
failed
as
my
pennoned
spirit
leapt
aloft
perhaps
my
brain
grew
dizzy
but
the
world
i
left
so
late
was
into
chaos
hurled
sprang
from
her
station
on
the
winds
apart
and
rolled
a
flame
the
fiery
heaven
athwart
methought
my
sweet
one
then
i
ceased
to
soar
and
fell
not
swiftly
as
i
rose
before
but
with
a
downward
tremulous
motion
light
brazen

this

fame
the
searing
glory
which
hath
shone
amid
the
jewels
of
my
throne
halo
of
hell
and
with
a
pain
not
hell
shall
make
me
fear
again
o
craving
heart
for
the
lost
flowers
and
sunshine
of
my
summer
hours
the
undying
voice
of
that
dead
time
with
its
interminable
chime
rings
in
the
spirit
of
a
spell
upon
thy
emptiness
a
knell
i
have
not
always
been
as
now
the
fevered
diadem
on
my
brow
i
claimed
and
won
usurpingly
hath
not
the
same
fierce
heirdom
given
rome
to
the
cæsar
this
to
me
the
heritage
of
a
kingly
mind
and
a
proud
spirit
which
hath
striven
triumphantly
with
human
kind
on
mountain
soil
i
first
drew
life
the
mists
of
the
taglay
have
shed
nightly
their
dews
upon
my
head
and
i
believe
the
winged
strife
and
tumult
of
the
headlong
air
have
nestled
in
my
very
hair
so
late
from
heaven
that
dew
it
fell
dreams
of
an
unholy
night
upon
me
with
the
touch
of
hell
while
the
red
flashing
of
the
light
from
clouds
that
hung
like
banners
appeared
to
my
eye
the
pageantry
of
monarchy
and
the
deep
roar
came
hurriedly
upon
me
telling
of
human
battle
where
my
voice
my
own
voice
silly
child
was
swelling
o
how
my
spirit
would
rejoice
and
leap
within
me
at
the
cry
the
of
victory
the
rain
came
down
upon
my
head
unsheltered
and
the
heavy
wind
rendered
me
mad
and
deaf
and
blind
it
was
but
man
i
thought
who
shed
laurels
upon
me
and
the
rush
the
torrent
of
the
chilly
air
gurgled
within
my
ear
the
crush
of
empires
with
the
captive
prayer
the
hum
of
suitors
and
the
tone
of
flattery
a
sovereign
throne
my
passions
from
that
hapless
hour
usurped
a
tyranny
which
men
have
deemed
since
i
have
reached
to
power
my
innate
nature
be
it
so
but
father
there
lived
one
who
then
then
in
my
boyhood
when
their
fire
burned
with
a
still
intenser
glow
for
passion
must
with
youth
expire
who
knew
this
iron
heart
in
woman
weakness
had
a
part
i
have
no
words
alas
to
tell
the
loveliness
of
loving
well
nor
would
i
now
attempt
to
trace
the
more
than
beauty
of
a
face
whose
lineaments
upon
my
mind
are
shadows
on
th
unstable
wind
thus
i
remember
having
dwelt
some
page
of
early
lore
upon
with
loitering
eye
till
i
have
felt
the
letters
with
their
meaning
melt
to
fantasies
with
none
o
she
was
worthy
of
all
love
love
as
in
infancy
was
mine
was
such
as
angel
minds
above
might
envy
her
young
heart
the
shrine
on
which
my
every
hope
and
thought
were
incense
then
a
goodly
gift
for
they
were
childish
and
upright
pure
as
her
young
example
taught
why
did
i
leave
it
and
adrift
trust
to
the
fire
within
for
light
we
grew
in
age
and
love
together
roaming
the
forest
and
the
wild
my
breast
her
shield
in
wintry
weather
and
when
the
friendly
sunshine
smiled
and
she
would
mark
the
opening
skies
saw
no
heaven
but
in
her
eyes
young
love
first
lesson
is
the
heart
for
that
sunshine
and
those
smiles
when
from
our
little
cares
apart
and
laughing
at
her
girlish
wiles
i
throw
me
on
her
throbbing
breast
and
pour
my
spirit
out
in
tears
there
was
no
need
to
speak
the
rest
no
need
to
quiet
any
fears
of
her
who
asked
no
reason
why
but
turned
on
me
her
quiet
eye
yet
than
worthy
of
the
love
my
spirit
struggled
with
and
strove
when
on
the
mountain
peak
alone
ambition
lent
it
a
new
tone
i
had
no
being
but
in
thee
the
world
and
all
it
did
contain
in
the
earth
the
air
the
sea
its
joy
its
little
lot
of
pain
that
was
new
pleasure
the
ideal
dim
vanities
of
dreams
by
night
and
dimmer
nothings
which
were
real
shadows
and
a
more
shadowy
light
parted
upon
their
misty
wings
and
so
confusedly
became
thine
image
and
a
name
a
name
two
separate
yet
most
intimate
things
i
was
ambitious
have
you
known
the
passion
father
you
have
not
a
cottager
i
marked
a
throne
of
half
the
world
as
all
my
own
and
murmured
at
such
lowly
lot
but
just
like
any
other
dream
upon
the
vapor
of
the
dew
my
own
had
past
did
not
the
beam
of
beauty
which
did
while
it
the
minute
the
hour
the
day
oppress
my
mind
with
double
loveliness
we
walked
together
on
the
crown
of
a
high
mountain
which
looked
down
afar
from
its
proud
natural
towers
of
rock
and
forest
on
the
hills
the
dwindled
hills
begirt
with
bowers
and
shouting
with
a
thousand
rills
i
spoke
to
her
of
power
and
pride
but
mystically
in
such
guise
that
she
might
deem
it
nought
beside
the
moment
converse
in
her
eyes
i
read
perhaps
too
carelessly
a
mingled
feeling
with
my
own
the
flush
on
her
bright
cheek
to
me
seemed
to
become
a
queenly
throne
too
well
that
i
should
let
it
be
light
in
the
wilderness
alone
i
wrapped
myself
in
grandeur
then
and
donned
a
visionary
crown
yet
it
was
not
that
fantasy
had
thrown
her
mantle
over
me
but
that
among
the
rabble
men
lion
ambition
is
chained
down
and
crouches
to
a
keeper
hand
not
so
in
deserts
where
the
grand
the
wild
the
terrible
conspire
with
their
own
breath
to
fan
his
fire
look
thee
now
on
samarcand
is
she
not
queen
of
earth
her
pride
above
all
cities
in
her
hand
their
destinies
in
all
beside
of
glory
which
the
world
hath
known
stands
she
not
nobly
and
alone
falling
her
veriest
shall
form
the
pedestal
of
a
throne
and
who
her
sovereign
timour
he
whom
the
astonished
people
saw
striding
empires
haughtily
a
diademed
outlaw
o
human
love
thou
spirit
given
on
earth
of
all
we
hope
in
heaven
which
into
the
soul
like
rain
upon
the
plain
and
failing
in
thy
power
to
bless
but
the
heart
a
wilderness
idea
which
bindest
life
around
with
music
of
so
strange
a
sound
and
beauty
of
so
wild
a
birth
farewell
for
i
have
won
the
earth
when
hope
the
eagle
that
towered
could
see
no
cliff
beyond
him
in
the
sky
his
pinions
were
bent
droopingly
and
homeward
turned
his
softened
eye
was
sunset
when
the
sun
will
part
there
comes
a
sullenness
of
heart
to
him
who
still
would
look
upon
the
glory
of
the
summer
sun
that
soul
will
hate
the
mist
so
often
lovely
and
will
list
to
the
sound
of
the
coming
darkness
known
to
those
whose
spirits
hearken
as
one
who
in
a
dream
of
night
fly
but
from
a
danger
nigh
what
tho
the
moon
tho
the
white
moon
shed
all
the
splendor
of
her
noon
smile
is
chilly
and
beam
in
that
time
of
dreariness
will
seem
so
like
you
gather
in
your
breath
a
portrait
taken
after
death
and
boyhood
is
a
summer
sun
whose
waning
is
the
dreariest
one
for
all
we
live
to
know
is
known
and
all
we
seek
to
keep
hath
flown
let
life
then
as
the
fall
with
the
beauty
which
is
all
i
reached
my
home
my
home
no
more
for
all
had
flown
who
made
it
so
i
passed
from
out
its
mossy
door
and
tho
my
tread
was
soft
and
low
a
voice
came
from
the
threshold
stone
of
one
whom
i
had
earlier
known
o
i
defy
thee
hell
to
show
on
beds
of
fire
that
burn
below
an
humbler
heart
a
deeper
woe
father
i
firmly
do
believe
i
for
death
who
comes
for
me
from
regions
of
the
blest
afar
where
there
is
nothing
to
deceive
hath
left
his
iron
gate
ajar
and
rays
of
truth
you
can
not
see
are
flashing
thro
eternity
i
do
believe
that
eblis
hath
a
snare
in
every
human
path
else
how
when
in
the
holy
grove
i
wandered
of
the
idol
love
who
daily
scents
his
snowy
wings
with
incense
of
from
the
most
unpolluted
things
whose
pleasant
bowers
are
yet
so
riven
above
with
trellised
rays
from
heaven
no
mote
may
shun
no
tiniest
fly
the
of
his
eagle
eye
how
was
it
that
ambition
crept
unseen
amid
the
revels
there
till
growing
bold
he
laughed
and
leapt
in
the
tangles
of
love
very
hair
to
helen
helen
thy
beauty
is
to
me
like
those
nicean
barks
of
yore
that
gently
a
perfumed
sea
the
weary
wayworn
wanderer
bore
to
his
own
native
shore
on
desperate
seas
long
wont
to
roam
thy
hyacinth
hair
thy
classic
face
thy
naiad
airs
have
brought
me
home
to
the
glory
that
was
greece
to
the
grandeur
that
was
rome
lo
in
yon
brilliant
window
niche
how
i
see
thee
stand
the
agate
lamp
within
thy
hand
ah
psyche
from
the
regions
which
are
holy
land
the
valley
of
unrest
it
smiled
a
silent
dell
where
the
people
did
not
dwell
they
had
gone
unto
the
wars
trusting
to
the
stars
nightly
from
their
azure
towers
to
keep
watch
above
the
flowers
in
the
midst
of
which
all
day
the
red
lazily
lay
each
visitor
shall
confess
the
sad
valley
restlessness
nothing
there
is
motionless
nothing
save
the
airs
that
brood
over
the
magic
solitude
ah
by
no
wind
are
stirred
those
trees
that
palpitate
like
the
chill
seas
around
the
misty
hebrides
ah
by
no
wind
those
clouds
are
driven
that
rustle
through
the
unquiet
heaven
unceasingly
from
morn
till
even
over
the
violets
there
that
lie
in
myriad
types
of
the
human
eye
over
the
lilies
that
wave
and
weep
above
a
nameless
grave
they
wave
from
out
their
fragrant
tops
eternal
dews
come
down
in
drops
they
weep
from
off
their
delicate
stems
perennial
tears
descend
in
gems
israfel
in
heaven
a
spirit
doth
dwell
whose
are
a
lute
none
sing
so
wildly
well
as
the
angel
israfel
and
the
giddy
stars
so
legends
tell
ceasing
their
hymns
attend
the
spell
of
his
voice
all
mute
tottering
above
in
her
highest
noon
the
enamoured
moon
blushes
with
love
while
to
listen
the
red
levin
with
the
rapid
pleiads
even
which
were
seven
pauses
in
heaven
and
they
say
the
starry
choir
and
the
other
listening
things
that
israfeli
fire
is
owing
to
that
lyre
by
which
he
sits
and
sings
the
trembling
living
wire
of
those
unusual
strings
but
the
skies
that
angel
trod
where
deep
thoughts
are
a
duty
where
love
a
god
where
the
houri
glances
are
imbued
with
all
the
beauty
which
we
worship
in
a
star
therefore
thou
art
not
wrong
israfeli
who
despisest
an
unimpassioned
song
to
thee
the
laurels
belong
best
bard
because
the
wisest
merrily
live
and
long
the
ecstasies
above
with
thy
burning
measures
suit
thy
grief
thy
joy
thy
hate
thy
love
with
the
fervor
of
thy
lute
well
may
the
stars
be
mute
yes
heaven
is
thine
but
this
is
a
world
of
sweets
and
sours
our
flowers
are
merely
flowers
and
the
shadow
of
thy
perfect
bliss
is
the
sunshine
of
ours
if
i
could
dwell
where
israfel
hath
dwelt
and
he
where
i
he
might
not
sing
so
wildly
well
a
mortal
melody
while
a
bolder
note
than
this
might
swell
from
my
lyre
within
the
sky
footnote
and
the
angel
israfel
whose
are
a
lute
and
who
has
the
sweetest
voice
of
all
god
creatures
to
i
heed
not
that
my
earthly
lot
hath
little
of
earth
in
it
that
years
of
love
have
been
forgot
in
the
hatred
of
a
minute
i
mourn
not
that
the
desolate
are
happier
sweet
than
i
but
that
sorrow
for
fate
who
am
a
to
the
bowers
whereat
in
dreams
i
see
the
wantonest
singing
birds
are
lips
and
all
thy
melody
of
words
thine
eyes
in
heaven
of
heart
enshrined
then
desolately
fall
o
god
on
my
funereal
mind
like
starlight
on
a
pall
thy
heart
heart
i
wake
and
sigh
and
sleep
to
dream
till
day
of
the
truth
that
gold
can
never
buy
of
the
baubles
that
it
may
to
the
river
fair
river
in
thy
bright
clear
flow
of
crystal
wandering
water
thou
art
an
emblem
of
the
glow
of
beauty
the
unhidden
heart
the
playful
maziness
of
art
in
old
alberto
daughter
but
when
within
thy
wave
she
looks
which
glistens
then
and
trembles
why
then
the
prettiest
of
brooks
her
worshipper
resembles
for
in
his
heart
as
in
thy
stream
her
image
deeply
lies
his
heart
which
trembles
at
the
beam
of
her
eyes
song
i
saw
thee
on
thy
bridal
day
when
a
burning
blush
came
thee
though
happiness
around
thee
lay
the
world
all
love
before
thee
and
in
thine
eye
a
kindling
light
whatever
it
might
be
was
all
on
earth
my
aching
sight
of
loveliness
could
see
that
blush
perhaps
was
maiden
shame
as
such
it
well
may
pass
though
its
glow
hath
raised
a
fiercer
flame
in
the
breast
of
him
alas
who
saw
thee
on
that
bridal
day
when
that
deep
blush
come
thee
though
happiness
around
thee
lay
the
world
all
love
before
thee
spirits
of
the
dead
thy
soul
shall
find
itself
alone
dark
thoughts
of
the
gray
tombstone
not
one
of
all
the
crowd
to
pry
into
thine
hour
of
secrecy
be
silent
in
that
solitude
which
is
not
loneliness
for
then
the
spirits
of
the
dead
who
stood
in
life
before
thee
are
again
in
death
around
thee
and
their
will
shall
overshadow
thee
be
still
the
night
tho
clear
shall
frown
and
the
stars
shall
not
look
down
from
their
high
thrones
in
the
heaven
with
light
like
hope
to
mortals
given
but
their
red
orbs
without
beam
to
thy
weariness
shall
seem
as
a
burning
and
a
fever
which
would
cling
to
thee
forever
now
are
thoughts
thou
shalt
not
banish
now
are
visions
to
vanish
from
thy
spirit
shall
they
pass
no
more
like
from
the
grass
the
breeze
the
breath
of
god
is
still
and
the
mist
upon
the
hill
shadowy
shadowy
yet
unbroken
is
a
symbol
and
a
token
how
it
hangs
upon
the
trees
a
mystery
of
mysteries
a
dream
in
visions
of
the
dark
night
i
have
dreamed
of
joy
departed
but
a
waking
dream
of
life
and
light
hath
left
me
ah
what
is
not
a
dream
by
day
to
him
whose
eyes
are
cast
on
things
around
him
with
a
ray
turned
back
upon
the
past
that
holy
dream
that
holy
dream
while
all
the
world
were
chiding
hath
cheered
me
as
a
lovely
beam
a
lonely
spirit
guiding
what
though
that
light
thro
storm
and
night
so
trembled
from
afar
what
could
there
be
more
purely
bright
in
truth
day
star
romance
romance
who
loves
to
nod
and
sing
with
drowsy
head
and
folded
wing
among
the
green
leaves
as
they
shake
far
down
within
some
shadowy
lake
to
me
a
painted
paroquet
hath
been
a
most
familiar
bird
taught
me
my
alphabet
to
say
to
lisp
my
very
earliest
word
while
in
the
wild
wood
i
did
lie
a
child
with
a
most
knowing
eye
of
late
eternal
condor
years
so
shake
the
very
heaven
on
high
with
tumult
as
they
thunder
by
i
have
no
time
for
idle
cares
though
gazing
on
the
unquiet
sky
and
when
an
hour
with
calmer
wings
its
down
upon
my
spirit
flings
that
little
time
with
lyre
and
rhyme
to
while
away
forbidden
things
my
heart
would
feel
to
be
a
crime
unless
it
trembled
with
the
strings
fairyland
dim
vales
and
shadowy
floods
and
woods
whose
forms
we
ca
discover
for
the
tears
that
drip
all
over
huge
moons
there
wax
and
wane
again
again
again
every
moment
of
the
night
forever
changing
places
and
they
put
out
the
with
the
breath
from
their
pale
faces
about
twelve
by
the
one
more
filmy
than
the
rest
a
kind
which
upon
trial

its

circumference
in

drapery
falls
over
hamlets
over
halls

they

over

on
the

over
every

my

to
haunt
of
the
wide
world
a
spot
the
which
i
could
not
love
the
less
so
lovely
was
the
loneliness
of
a
wild
lake
with
black
rock
bound
and
the
tall
pines
that
towered
around
but
when
the
night
had
thrown
her
pall
upon
the
spot
as
upon
all
and
the
mystic
wind
went
by
murmuring
in
melody
then
ah
then
i
would
awake
to
the
terror
of
the
lone
lake
yet
that
terror
was
not
fright
but
a
tremulous
delight
a
feeling
not
the
jewelled
mine
could
teach
or
bribe
me
to
define
nor
love
although
the
love
were
thine
death
was
in
that
poisonous
wave
and
in
its
gulf
a
fitting
grave
for
him
who
thence
could
solace
bring
to
his
lone
imagining
whose
solitary
soul
could
make

early

anacreon
rhymes

almost
passionate
sometimes
and
by
strange
alchemy
of
brain
his
pleasures
always
turned
to
pain
his
naïveté
to
wild
desire
his
wit
to
love
his
wine
to
fire
and
so
being
young
and
dipt
in
folly
i
fell
in
love
with
melancholy

used
to
throw
my
earthly
rest
and
quiet
all
away

jest
i
could
not
love

where
death
was
mingling
his
with

stalking
between

hath
too
much
room

the
glory
and
the
gloom
the
black
hath
mellow
into
gray
and
all
the
fires
are
fading
away
my
draught
of
passion
hath
been
deep

and
i
now
would
sleep

after
drunkenness
of
soul
succeeds
the
glories

the
bowl
an
idle
longing
night
and
day
to
dream
my
very
life
away
but
dreams
of
those
who
dream
as
i
aspiringly
are
damned
and
die
yet
should
i
swear
i
mean
alone
by
notes
so
very
shrilly
blown
to
break

not
taken
my
sorrow
i
could
not
awaken
my
heart
to
joy
at
the
same
tone
and
all
i
loved
loved
alone
in
my
childhood
in
the
dawn
of
a
most
stormy
life
was
drawn
from
every
depth
of
good
and

the
mystery
which
binds
me
still
from

from

cliff

the
mountain
from
the
sun
that
round
me
in
its
autumn
tint
of
gold
from
the
lightning
in
the
sky
as
it
passed
me
flying
by
from
the
thunder
and
the
storm
and
the
cloud
that
took
the
form
when
the
rest
of
heaven
was
blue
of
a
demon
in
my
view
march
to
isadore
i
beneath
the
eaves
whose
shadows
fall
before
thy
lowly
cottage
door
under
the
lilac
tremulous
leaves
within
thy
snowy
clasped
hand
the
purple
flowers
it
bore
last
eve
in
dreams
i
saw
thee
stand
like
queenly
nymph
from
enchantress
of
the
flowery
wand
most
beauteous
isadore
ii
and
when
i
bade
the
dream
upon
thy
spirit
flee
thy
violet
eyes
to
me
upturned
did
overflowing
seem
with
the
deep
untold
delight
of
love
serenity
thy
classic
brow
like
lilies
white
and
pale
as
the
imperial
night
upon
her
throne
with
stars
bedight
enthralled
my
soul
to
thee
iii
ah
ever
i
behold
thy
dreamy
passionate
eyes
blue
as
the
languid
skies
hung
with
the
sunset
fringe
of
gold
now
strangely
clear
thine
image
grows
and
olden
memories
are
startled
from
their
long
repose
like
shadows
on
the
silent
snows
when
suddenly
the
blows
where
quiet
moonlight
lies
iv
like
music
heard
in
dreams
like
strains
of
harps
unknown
of
birds
for
ever
flown
audible
as
the
voice
of
streams
that
murmur
in
some
leafy
dell
i
hear
thy
gentlest
tone
and
silence
cometh
with
her
spell
like
that
which
on
my
tongue
doth
dwell
when
tremulous
in
dreams
i
tell
my
love
to
thee
alone
in
every
valley
heard
floating
from
tree
to
tree
less
beautiful
to
me
the
music
of
the
radiant
bird
than
artless
accents
such
as
thine
whose
echoes
never
flee
ah
how
for
thy
sweet
voice
i
pine
for
uttered
in
thy
tones
benign
enchantress
this
rude
name
of
mine
doth
seem
a
melody
the
village
street
in
these
rapid
restless
shadows
once
i
walked
at
eventide
when
a
gentle
silent
maiden
walked
in
beauty
at
my
side
she
alone
there
walked
beside
me
all
in
beauty
like
a
bride
pallidly
the
moon
was
shining
on
the
dewy
meadows
nigh
on
the
silvery
silent
rivers
on
the
mountains
far
and
high
on
the
ocean
waters
where
the
winds
die
slowly
silently
we
wandered
from
the
open
cottage
door
underneath
the
elm
long
branches
to
the
pavement
bending
underneath
the
mossy
willow
and
the
dying
sycamore
with
the
myriad
stars
in
beauty
all
bedight
the
heavens
were
seen
radiant
hopes
were
bright
around
me
like
the
light
of
stars
serene
like
the
mellow
midnight
splendor
of
the
night
irradiate
queen
audibly
the
whispered
peaceful
pleasant
melodies
like
the
distant
murmured
music
of
unquiet
lovely
seas
while
the
winds
were
hushed
in
slumber
in
the
fragrant
flowers
and
trees
wondrous
and
unwonted
beauty
still
adorning
all
did
seem
while
i
told
my
love
in
fables
the
willows
by
the
stream
would
the
heart
have
kept
unspoken
love
that
was
its
rarest
dream
instantly
away
we
wandered
in
the
shadowy
twilight
tide
she
the
silent
scornful
maiden
walking
calmly
at
my
side
with
a
step
serene
and
stately
all
in
beauty
all
in
pride
vacantly
i
walked
beside
her
on
the
earth
mine
eyes
were
cast
swift
and
keen
there
came
unto
me
bitter
memories
of
the
past
on
me
like
the
rain
in
autumn
on
the
dead
leaves
cold
and
fast
underneath
the
elms
we
parted
by
the
lowly
cottage
door
one
brief
word
alone
was
uttered
never
on
our
lips
before
and
away
i
walked
forlornly
evermore
slowly
silently
i
loitered
homeward
in
the
night
alone
sudden
anguish
bound
my
spirit
that
my
youth
had
never
known
wild
unrest
like
that
which
cometh
when
the
night
first
dream
hath
flown
now
to
me
the
whisper
mad
discordant
melodies
and
keen
melodies
like
shadows
haunt
the
moaning
willow
trees
and
the
sycamores
with
laughter
mock
me
in
the
nightly
breeze
sad
and
pale
the
autumn
moonlight
through
the
sighing
foliage
streams
and
each
morning
midnight
shadow
shadow
of
my
sorrow
seems
strive
o
heart
forget
thine
idol
and
o
soul
forget
thy
dreams
the
forest
reverie
is
said
that
when
the
hands
of
men
tamed
this
primeval
wood
and
hoary
trees
with
groans
of
wo
like
warriors
by
an
unknown
foe
were
in
their
strength
subdued
the
virgin
earth
gave
instant
birth
to
springs
that
did
flow
that
in
the
sun
did
rivulets
run
and
all
around
rare
flowers
did
blow
the
wild
rose
pale
perfumed
the
gale
and
the
queenly
lily
adown
the
dale
whom
the
sun
and
the
dew
and
the
winds
did
woo
with
the
gourd
and
the
grape
luxuriant
grew
so
when
in
tears
the
love
of
years
is
wasted
like
the
snow
and
the
fine
fibrils
of
its
life
by
the
rude
wrong
of
instant
strife
are
broken
at
a
blow
within
the
heart
do
springs
upstart
of
which
it
doth
now
know
and
strange
sweet
dreams
like
silent
streams
that
from
new
fountains
overflow
with
the
earlier
tide
of
rivers
glide
deep
in
the
heart
whose
hope
has
died
quenching
the
fires
its
ashes
hide
its
ashes
whence
will
spring
and
grow
sweet
flowers
ere
long
the
rare
and
radiant
flowers
of
song
notes
of
the
many
verses
from

to
time
ascribed
to
the
pen
of
edgar
poe
and
not
included
among
his
known
writings
the
lines
entitled
alone
have
the
chief
claim
to
our
notice
copies
of
this
piece
had
been
in
possession
of
the
present
editor
some
time
previous
to
its
publication
in
magazine
for
september
but
as
proofs
of
the
authorship
claimed
for
it
were
not
forthcoming
he
refrained
from
publishing
it
as
requested
the
desired
proofs
have
not
yet
been
adduced
and
there
is
at
present
nothing
but
internal
evidence
to
guide
us
alone
is
stated
to
have
been
written
by
poe
in
the
album
of
a
baltimore
lady
mrs
balderstone
on
march
and
the
given
in
is
alleged
to
be
of
his
handwriting
if
the
caligraphy
be
poe
it
is
different
in
all
essential
respects
from
all
the
many
specimens
known
to
us
and
strongly
resembles
that
of
the
writer
of
the
heading
and
dating
of
the
manuscript
both
of
which
the
contributor
of
the
poem
acknowledges
to
have
been
recently
added
the
lines
however
if
not
by
poe
are
the
most
successful
imitation
of
his
early
mannerisms
yet
made
public
and
in
the
opinion
of
one
well
qualified
to
speak
are
not
unworthy
on
the
whole
of
the
parentage
claimed
for
them
whilst
edgar
poe
was
editor
of
the
journal
some
lines
to
isadore
appeared
therein
and
like
several
of
his
known
pieces
bore
no
signature
they
were
at
once
ascribed
to
poe
and
in
order
to
satisfy
questioners
an
editorial
paragraph
subsequently
appeared
saying
they
were
by
ide
junior
two
previous
poems
had
appeared
in
the
journal
over
the
signature
of
ide
and
whoever
wrote
them
was
also
the
author
of
the
lines
to
isadore
in
order
doubtless
to
give
a
show
of
variety
poe
was
then
publishing
some
of
his
known
works
in
his
journal
over
de
plume
and
as
no
other
writings
whatever
can
be
traced
to
any
person
bearing
the
name
of
ide
it
is
not
impossible
that
the
poems
now
republished
in
this
collection
may
be
by
the
author
of
the
raven
having
been
published
without
his
usual
elaborate
revision
poe
may
have
wished
to
hide
his
hasty
work
under
an
assumed
name
the
three
pieces
are
included
in
the
present
collection
so
the
reader
can
judge
for
himself
what
pretensions
they
possess
to
be
by
the
author
of
the
raven
prose
poems
the
island
of
the
fay
nullus
enim
locus
sine
genio
est
says
marmontel
in
those
contes
moraux
which
in
all
our
translations
we
have
insisted
upon
calling
moral
tales
as
if
in
mockery
of
their
spirit
musique

le
seul

qui

de

he
here
confounds
the
pleasure
derivable
from
sweet
sounds
with
the
capacity
for
creating
them
no
more
than
any
other
is
that
for
music
susceptible
of
complete
enjoyment
where
there
is
no
second
party
to
appreciate
its
exercise
and
it
is
only
in
common
with
other
talents
that
it
produces
which
may
be
fully
enjoyed
in
solitude
the
idea
which
the
has
either
failed
to
entertain
clearly
or
has
sacrificed
in
its
expression
to
his
national
love
of
is
doubtless
the
very
tenable
one
that
the
higher
order
of
music
is
the
most
thoroughly
estimated
when
we
are
exclusively
alone
the
proposition
in
this
form
will
be
admitted
at
once
by
those
who
love
the
lyre
for
its
own
sake
and
for
its
spiritual
uses
but
there
is
one
pleasure
still
within
the
reach
of
fallen
mortality
and
perhaps
only
one
which
owes
even
more
than
does
music
to
the
accessory
sentiment
of
seclusion
i
mean
the
happiness
experienced
in
the
contemplation
of
natural
scenery
in
truth
the
man
who
would
behold
aright
the
glory
of
god
upon
earth
must
in
solitude
behold
that
glory
to
me
at
least
the
presence
not
of
human
life
only
but
of
life
in
any
other
form
than
that
of
the
green
things
which
grow
upon
the
soil
and
are
voiceless
is
a
stain
upon
the
landscape
is
at
war
with
the
genius
of
the
scene
i
love
indeed
to
regard
the
dark
valleys
and
the
gray
rocks
and
the
waters
that
silently
smile
and
the
forests
that
sigh
in
uneasy
slumbers
and
the
proud
watchful
mountains
that
look
down
upon
all
i
love
to
regard
these
as
themselves
but
the
colossal
members
of
one
vast
animate
and
sentient
whole
a
whole
whose
form
that
of
the
sphere
is
the
most
perfect
and
most
inclusive
of
all
whose
path
is
among
associate
planets
whose
meek
handmaiden
is
the
moon
whose
mediate
sovereign
is
the
sun
whose
life
is
eternity
whose
thought
is
that
of
a
god
whose
enjoyment
is
knowledge
whose
destinies
are
lost
in
immensity
whose
cognizance
of
ourselves
is
akin
with
our
own
cognizance
of
the
which
infest
the
brain
a
being
which
we
in
consequence
regard
as
purely
inanimate
and
material
much
in
the
same
manner
as
these
must
thus
regard
us
our
telescopes
and
our
mathematical
investigations
assure
us
on
every
hand
notwithstanding
the
cant
of
the
more
ignorant
of
the
priesthood
that
space
and
therefore
that
bulk
is
an
important
consideration
in
the
eyes
of
the
almighty
the
cycles
in
which
the
stars
move
are
those
best
adapted
for
the
evolution
without
collision
of
the
greatest
possible
number
of
bodies
the
forms
of
those
bodies
are
accurately
such
as
within
a
given
surface
to
include
the
greatest
possible
amount
of
matter
while
the
surfaces
themselves
are
so
disposed
as
to
accommodate
a
denser
population
than
could
be
accommodated
on
the
same
surfaces
otherwise
arranged
nor
is
it
any
argument
against
bulk
being
an
object
with
god
that
space
itself
is
infinite
for
there
may
be
an
infinity
of
matter
to
fill
it
and
since
we
see
clearly
that
the
endowment
of
matter
with
vitality
is
a
principle
indeed
as
far
as
our
judgments
extend
the
principle
in
the
operations
of
deity
it
is
scarcely
logical
to
imagine
it
confined
to
the
regions
of
the
minute
where
we
daily
trace
it
and
not
extending
to
those
of
the
august
as
we
find
cycle
within
cycle
without
end
yet
all
revolving
around
one
centre
which
is
the
godhead
may
we
not
analogically
suppose
in
the
same
manner
life
within
life
the
less
within
the
greater
and
all
within
the
spirit
divine
in
short
we
are
madly
erring
through
in
believing
man
in
either
his
temporal
or
future
destinies
to
be
of
more
moment
in
the
universe
than
that
vast
clod
of
the
valley
which
he
tills
and
contemns
and
to
which
he
denies
a
soul
for
no
more
profound
reason
than
that
he
does
not
behold
it
in
operation
these
fancies
and
such
as
these
have
always
given
to
my
meditations
among
the
mountains
and
the
forests
by
the
rivers
and
the
ocean
a
tinge
of
what
the
world
would
not
fail
to
term
the
fantastic
my
wanderings
amid
such
scenes
have
been
many
and
and
often
solitary
and
the
interest
with
which
i
have
strayed
through
many
a
dim
deep
valley
or
gazed
into
the
reflected
heaven
of
many
a
bright
lake
has
been
an
interest
greatly
deepened
by
the
thought
that
i
have
strayed
and
gazed
what
flippant
frenchman
was
it
who
said
in
allusion
to
the
well
known
work
of
zimmermann
that
la
solitude
est
une
belle
chose
mais
il
faut
pour
vous
dire
que
la
solitude
est
une
belle
chose
the
epigram
can
not
be
gainsaid
but
the
necessity
is
a
thing
that
does
not
exist
it
was
during
one
of
my
lonely
journeyings
amid
a
far
distant
region
of
mountain
locked
within
mountain
and
sad
rivers
and
melancholy
tarns
writhing
or
sleeping
within
all
that
i
chanced
upon
a
certain
rivulet
and
island
i
came
upon
them
suddenly
in
the
leafy
june
and
threw
myself
upon
the
turf
beneath
the
branches
of
an
unknown
odorous
shrub
that
i
might
doze
as
i
contemplated
the
scene
i
felt
that
thus
only
should
i
look
upon
it
such
was
the
character
of
phantasm
which
it
wore
on
all
sides
save
to
the
west
where
the
sun
was
about
sinking
arose
the
verdant
walls
of
the
forest
the
little
river
which
turned
sharply
in
its
course
and
was
thus
immediately
lost
to
sight
seemed
to
have
no
exit
from
its
prison
but
to
be
absorbed
by
the
deep
green
foliage
of
the
trees
to
the
east
while
in
the
opposite
quarter
so
it
appeared
to
me
as
i
lay
at
length
and
glanced
upward
there
poured
down
noiselessly
and
continuously
into
the
valley
a
rich
golden
and
crimson
waterfall
from
the
sunset
fountains
of
the
sky
about
midway
in
the
short
vista
which
my
dreamy
vision
took
in
one
small
circular
island
profusely
verdured
reposed
upon
the
bosom
of
the
stream
so
blended
bank
and
shadow
there
that
each
seemed
pendulous
in
air
so
was
the
glassy
water
that
it
was
scarcely
possible
to
say
at
what
point
upon
the
slope
of
the
emerald
turf
its
crystal
dominion
began
my
position
enabled
me
to
include
in
a
single
view
both
the
eastern
and
western
extremities
of
the
islet
and
i
observed
a
difference
in
their
aspects
the
latter
was
all
one
radiant
harem
of
garden
beauties
it
glowed
and
blushed
beneath
the
eye
of
the
slant
sunlight
and
fairly
laughed
with
flowers
the
grass
was
short
springy
and
the
trees
were
lithe
mirthful
erect
bright
slender
and
graceful
of
eastern
figure
and
foliage
with
bark
smooth
glossy
and
there
seemed
a
deep
sense
of
life
and
joy
about
all
and
although
no
airs
blew
from
out
the
heavens
yet
everything
had
motion
through
the
gentle
sweepings
to
and
fro
of
innumerable
butterflies
that
might
have
been
mistaken
for
tulips
with
wings
the
other
or
eastern
end
of
the
isle
was
whelmed
in
the
blackest
shade
a
sombre
yet
beautiful
and
peaceful
gloom
here
pervaded
all
things
the
trees
were
dark
in
color
and
mournful
in
form
and
attitude
wreathing
themselves
into
sad
solemn
and
spectral
shapes
that
conveyed
ideas
of
mortal
sorrow
and
untimely
death
the
grass
wore
the
deep
tint
of
the
cypress
and
the
heads
of
its
blades
hung
droopingly
and
hither
and
thither
among
it
were
many
small
unsightly
hillocks
low
and
narrow
and
not
very
long
that
had
the
aspect
of
graves
but
were
not
although
over
and
all
about
them
the
rue
and
the
rosemary
clambered
the
shades
of
the
trees
fell
heavily
upon
the
water
and
seemed
to
bury
itself
therein
impregnating
the
depths
of
the
element
with
darkness
i
fancied
that
each
shadow
as
the
sun
descended
lower
and
lower
separated
itself
sullenly
from
the
trunk
that
gave
it
birth
and
thus
became
absorbed
by
the
stream
while
other
shadows
issued
momently
from
the
trees
taking
the
place
of
their
predecessors
thus
entombed
this
idea
having
once
seized
upon
my
fancy
greatly
excited
it
and
i
lost
myself
forthwith
in
reverie
if
ever
island
were
enchanted
said
i
to
myself
this
is
it
this
is
the
haunt
of
the
few
gentle
fays
who
remain
from
the
wreck
of
the
race
are
these
green
tombs
theirs
or
do
they
yield
up
their
sweet
lives
as
mankind
yield
up
their
own
in
dying
do
they
not
rather
waste
away
mournfully
rendering
unto
god
little
by
little
their
existence
as
these
trees
render
up
shadow
after
shadow
exhausting
their
substance
unto
dissolution
what
the
wasting
tree
is
to
the
water
that
imbibes
its
shade
growing
thus
blacker
by
what
it
preys
upon
may
not
the
life
of
the
fay
be
to
the
death
which
engulfs
it
as
i
thus
mused
with
eyes
while
the
sun
sank
rapidly
to
rest
and
eddying
currents
careered
round
and
round
the
island
bearing
upon
their
bosom
large
dazzling
white
flakes
of
the
bark
of
the
sycamore
flakes
which
in
their
multiform
positions
upon
the
water
a
quick
imagination
might
have
converted
into
anything
it
pleased
while
i
thus
mused
it
appeared
to
me
that
the
form
of
one
of
those
very
fays
about
whom
i
had
been
pondering
made
its
way
slowly
into
the
darkness
from
out
the
light
at
the
western
end
of
the
island
she
stood
erect
in
a
singularly
fragile
canoe
and
urged
it
with
the
mere
phantom
of
an
oar
while
within
the
influence
of
the
lingering
sunbeams
her
attitude
seemed
indicative
of
joy
but
sorrow
deformed
it
as
she
passed
within
the
shade
slowly
she
glided
along
and
at
length
rounded
the
islet
and
the
region
of
light
the
revolution
which
has
just
been
made
by
the
fay
continued
i
musingly
is
the
cycle
of
the
brief
year
of
her
life
she
has
floated
through
her
winter
and
through
her
summer
she
is
a
year
nearer
unto
death
for
i
did
not
fail
to
see
that
as
she
came
into
the
shade
her
shadow
fell
from
her
and
was
swallowed
up

again
the

appeared

the
fay
but
about
the
attitude
of
the
latter
there
was
more
of
care
and
uncertainty
and
less
of
elastic
joy
she
floated
again
from
out
the
light
and
into
the
gloom
which
deepened
momently
and
again
her
shadow
fell
from
her
into
the
ebony
water
and
became
absorbed
into
its
blackness
and
again
and
again
she
made
the
circuit
of
the
island
while
the
sun
rushed
down
to
his
slumbers
and
at
each
issuing
into
the
light
there
was
more
sorrow
about
her
person
while
it
grew
feebler
and
far
fainter
and
more
indistinct
and
at
each
passage
into
the
gloom
there
fell
from
her
a
darker
shade
which
became
whelmed
in
a
shadow
more
black
but
at
length
when
the
sun
had
utterly
departed
the
fay
now
the
mere
ghost
of
her
former
self
went
disconsolately
with
her
boat
into
the
region
of
the
ebony
flood
and
that
she
issued
thence
at
all
i
can
not
say
for
darkness

over
all
things

just
now
of
the
modes
or
of
the
methods
of
what
during
mortality
we
were
accustomed
to
call
creation
do
you
mean
to
say
that
the
creator
is
not
god
i
mean
to
say
that
the
deity
does
not
create
explain
in
the
beginning
only
he
created
the
seeming
creatures
which
are
now
throughout
the
universe
so
perpetually
springing
into
being
can
only
be
considered
as
the
mediate
or
indirect
not
as
the
direct
or
immediate
results
of
the
divine
creative
power
among
men
my
agathos
this
idea
would
be
considered
heretical
in
the
extreme
among
the
angels
my
oinos
it
is
seen
to
be
simply
true
i
can
comprehend
you
thus
far
that
certain
operations
of
what
we
term
nature
or
the
natural
laws
will
under
certain
conditions
give
rise
to
that
which
has
all
the
of
creation
shortly
before
the
final
overthrow
of
the
earth
there
were
i
well
remember
many
very
successful
experiments
in
what
some
philosophers
were
weak
enough
to
denominate
the
creation
of
animalculæ
the
cases
of
which
you
speak
were
in
fact
instances
of
the
secondary
creation
and
of
the
species
of
creation
which
has
ever
been
since
the
first
word
spoke
into
existence
the
first
law
are
not
the
starry
worlds
that
from
the
abyss
of
nonentity
burst
hourly
forth
into
the
heavens
are
not
these
stars
agathos
the
immediate
handiwork
of
the
king
let
me
endeavor
my
oinos
to
lead
you
step
by
step
to
the
conception
i
intend
you
are
well
aware
that
as
no
thought
can
perish
so
no
act
is
without
infinite
result
we
moved
our
hands
for
example
when
we
were
dwellers
on
the
earth
and
in
so
doing
we
gave
vibration
to
the
atmosphere
which
engirdled
it
this
vibration
was
indefinitely
extended
till
it
gave
impulse
to
every
particle
of
the
earth
air
which
thenceforward
was
actuated
by
the
one
movement
of
the
hand
this
fact
the
mathematicians
of
our
globe
well
knew
they
made
the
special
effects
indeed
wrought
in
the
fluid
by
special
impulses
the
subject
of
exact
calculation
so
that
it
became
easy
to
determine
in
what
precise
period
an
impulse
of
given
extent
would
engirdle
the
orb
and
impress
forever
every
atom
of
the
atmosphere
circumambient
retrograding
they
found
no
difficulty
from
a
given
effect
under
given
conditions
in
determining
the
value
of
the
original
impulse
now
the
mathematicians
who
saw
that
the
results
of
any
given
impulse
were
absolutely
endless
and
who
saw
that
a
portion
of
these
results
were
accurately
traceable
through
the
agency
of
algebraic
analysis
who
saw
too
the
facility
of
the
retrogradation
these
men
saw
at
the
same
time
that
this
species
of
analysis
itself
had
within
itself
a
capacity
for
indefinite
progress
that
there
were
no
bounds
conceivable
to
its
advancement
and
applicability
except
within
the
intellect
of
him
who
advanced
or
applied
it
but
at
this
point
our
mathematicians
paused
and
why
agathos
should
they
have
proceeded
because
there
were
some
considerations
of
deep
interest
beyond
it
was
deducible
from
what
they
knew
that
to
a
being
of
infinite
understanding
one
to
whom
the
of
the
algebraic
analysis
lay
unfolded
there
could
be
no
difficulty
in
tracing
every
impulse
given
the
air
and
the
ether
through
the
air
to
the
remotest
consequences
at
any
even
infinitely
remote
epoch
of
time
it
is
indeed
demonstrable
that
every
such
impulse
the
must
the
impress
every
individual
thing
that
exists
the
universe
and
the
being
of
infinite
understanding
the
being
whom
we
have
imagined
might
trace
the
remote
undulations
of
the
impulse
trace
them
upward
and
onward
in
their
influences
upon
all
particles
of
all
matter
upward
and
onward
forever
in
their
modifications
of
old
forms
or
in
other
words
their
creation
of
until
he
found
them
reflected
unimpressive
back
from
the
throne
of
the
godhead
and
not
only
could
such
a
being
do
this
but
at
any
epoch
should
a
given
result
be
afforded
him
should
one
of
these
numberless
comets
for
example
be
presented
to
his
inspection
he
could
have
no
difficulty
in
determining
by
the
analytic
retrogradation
to
what
original
impulse
it
was
due
this
power
of
retrogradation
in
its
absolute
fulness
and
perfection
this
faculty
of
referring
at
epochs
effects
to
causes
is
of
course
the
prerogative
of
the
deity
alone
but
in
every
variety
of
degree
short
of
the
absolute
perfection
is
the
power
itself
exercised
by
the
whole
host
of
the
angelic
intelligences
but
you
speak
merely
of
impulses
upon
the
air
in
speaking
of
the
air
i
referred
only
to
the
earth
but
the
general
proposition
has
reference
to
impulses
upon
the
ether
which
since
it
pervades
and
alone
pervades
all
space
is
thus
the
great
medium
of
then
all
motion
of
whatever
nature
creates
it
must
but
a
true
philosophy
has
long
taught
that
the
source
of
all
motion
is
thought
and
the
source
of
all
thought
is
god
i
have
spoken
to
you
oinos
as
to
a
child
of
the
fair
earth
which
lately
perished
of
impulses
upon
the
atmosphere
of
the
earth
you
did
and
while
i
thus
spoke
did
there
not
cross
your
mind
some
thought
of
the
power
of
is
not
every
word
an
impulse
on
the
air
but
why
agathos
do
you
weep
and
why
oh
why
do
your
wings
droop
as
we
hover
above
this
fair
star
which
is
the
greenest
and
yet
most
terrible
of
all
we
have
encountered
in
our
flight
its
brilliant
flowers
look
like
a
fairy
dream
but
its
fierce
volcanoes
like
the
passions
of
a
turbulent
heart
they
they
this
wild
star
it
is
now
three
centuries
since
with
clasped
hands
and
with
streaming
eyes
at
the
feet
of
my
beloved
i
spoke
it
with
a
few
passionate
sentences
into
birth
its
brilliant
flowers
the
dearest
of
all
unfulfilled
dreams
and
its
raging
volcanoes
the
passions
of
the
most
turbulent
and
unhallowed
of
hearts
the
colloquy
of
monos
and
una
greek
mellonta
sauta
these
things
are
in
the
future
born
again
yes
fairest
and
best
beloved
una
born
again
these
were
the
words
upon
whose
mystical
meaning
i
had
so
long
pondered
rejecting
the
explanations
of
the
priesthood
until
death
itself
resolved
for
me
the
secret
death
how
strangely
sweet
you
echo
my
words
i
observe
too
a
vacillation
in
your
step
a
joyous
inquietude
in
your
eyes
you
are
confused
and
oppressed
by
the
majestic
novelty
of
the
life
eternal
yes
it
was
of
death
i
spoke
and
here
how
singularly
sounds
that
word
which
of
old
was
wont
to
bring
terror
to
all
hearts
throwing
a
mildew
upon
all
pleasures
ah
death
the
spectre
which
sate
at
all
feasts
how
often
monos
did
we
lose
ourselves
in
speculations
upon
its
nature
how
mysteriously
did
it
act
as
a
check
to
human
bliss
saying
unto
it
thus
far
and
no
farther
that
earnest
mutual
love
my
own
monos
which
burned
within
our
bosoms
how
vainly
did
we
flatter
ourselves
feeling
happy
in
its
first
upspringing
that
our
happiness
would
strengthen
with
its
strength
alas
as
it
grew
so
grew
in
our
hearts
the
dread
of
that
evil
hour
which
was
hurrying
to
separate
us
forever
thus
in
time
it
became
painful
to
love
hate
would
have
been
mercy
then
speak
not
here
of
these
griefs
dear
una
mine
mine
forever
now
but
the
memory
of
past
sorrow
is
it
not
present
joy
i
have
much
to
say
yet
of
the
things
which
have
been
above
all
i
burn
to
know
the
incidents
of
your
own
passage
through
the
dark
valley
and
shadow
and
when
did
the
radiant
una
ask
anything
of
her
monos
in
vain
i
will
be
minute
in
relating
all
but
at
what
point
shall
the
weird
narrative
begin
at
what
point
you
have
said
monos
i
comprehend
you
in
death
we
have
both
learned
the
propensity
of
man
to
define
the
indefinable
i
will
not
say
then
commence
with
the
moment
of
life
cessation
but
commence
with
that
sad
sad
instant
when
the
fever
having
abandoned
you
you
sank
into
a
breathless
and
motionless
torpor
and
i
pressed
down
your
pallid
eyelids
with
the
passionate
fingers
of
love
one
word
first
my
una
in
regard
to
man
general
condition
at
this
epoch
you
will
remember
that
one
or
two
of
the
wise
among
our
forefathers
wise
in
fact
although
not
in
the
world
esteem
had
ventured
to
doubt
the
propriety
of
the
term
improvement
as
applied
to
the
progress
of
our
civilization
there
were
periods
in
each
of
the
five
or
six
centuries
immediately
preceding
our
dissolution
when
arose
some
vigorous
intellect
boldly
contending
for
those
principles
whose
truth
appears
now
to
our
disenfranchised
reason
so
utterly
obvious
principles
which
should
have
taught
our
race
to
submit
to
the
guidance
of
the
natural
laws
rather
than
attempt
their
control
at
long
intervals
some
appeared
looking
upon
each
advance
in
practical
science
as
a
retrogradation
in
the
true
utility
occasionally
the
poetic
intellect
that
intellect
which
we
now
feel
to
have
been
the
most
exalted
of
all
since
those
truths
which
to
us
were
of
the
most
enduring
importance
could
only
be
reached
by
that
which
speaks
in
to
the
imagination
alone
and
to
the
unaided
reason
bears
no
weight
occasionally
did
this
poetic
intellect
proceed
a
step
farther
in
the
evolving
of
the
vague
idea
of
the
philosophic
and
find
in
the
mystic
parable
that
tells
of
the
tree
of
knowledge
and
of
its
forbidden
fruit
a
distinct
intimation
that
knowledge
was
not
meet
for
man
in
the
infant
condition
of
his
soul
and
these
men
the
poets
living
and
perishing
amid
the
scorn
of
the
utilitarians
of
rough
pedants
who
arrogated
to
themselves
a
title
which
could
have
been
properly
applied
only
to
the
scorned
these
men
the
poets
pondered
piningly
yet
not
unwisely
upon
the
ancient
days
when
our
wants
were
not
more
simple
than
our
enjoyments
were
keen
days
when
was
a
word
unknown
so
solemnly
was
happiness
holy
august
and
blissful
days
blue
rivers
ran
undammed
between
hills
unhewn
into
far
forest
solitudes
primeval
odorous
and
unexplored
yet
these
noble
exceptions
from
the
general
misrule
served
but
to
strengthen
it
by
opposition
alas
we
had
fallen
upon
the
most
evil
of
all
our
evil
days
the
great
movement
that
was
the
cant
term
went
on
a
diseased
commotion
moral
and
physical
art
the
arts
arose
supreme
and
once
enthroned
cast
chains
upon
the
intellect
which
had
elevated
them
to
power
man
because
he
could
not
but
acknowledge
the
majesty
of
nature
fell
into
childish
exultation
at
his
acquired
and
dominion
over
her
elements
even
while
he
stalked
a
god
in
his
own
fancy
an
infantine
imbecility
came
over
him
as
might
be
supposed
from
the
origin
of
his
disorder
he
grew
infected
with
system
and
with
abstraction
he
enwrapped
himself
in
generalities
among
other
odd
ideas
that
of
universal
equality
gained
ground
and
in
the
face
of
analogy
and
of
god
in
despite
of
the
loud
warning
voice
of
the
laws
of
so
visibly
pervading
all
things
in
earth
and
heaven
wild
attempts
at
an
omniprevalent
democracy
were
made
yet
this
evil
sprang
necessarily
from
the
leading
evil
knowledge
man
could
not
both
know
and
succumb
meantime
huge
smoking
cities
arose
innumerable
green
leaves
shrank
before
the
hot
breath
of
furnaces
the
fair
face
of
nature
was
deformed
as
with
the
ravages
of
some
loathsome
disease
and
methinks
sweet
una
even
our
slumbering
sense
of
the
forced
and
of
the
might
have
arrested
us
here
but
now
it
appears
that
we
had
worked
out
our
own
destruction
in
the
perversion
of
our
or
rather
in
the
blind
neglect
of
its
culture
in
the
schools
for
in
truth
it
was
at
this
crisis
that
taste
alone
that
faculty
which
holding
a
middle
position
between
the
pure
intellect
and
the
moral
sense
could
never
safely
have
been
disregarded
it
was
now
that
taste
alone
could
have
led
us
gently
back
to
beauty
to
nature
and
to
life
but
alas
for
the
pure
contemplative
spirit
and
majestic
intuition
of
plato
alas
for
the
greek
mousichae
which
he
justly
regarded
as
an
education
for
the
soul
alas
for
him
and
for
it
since
both
were
most
desperately
needed
when
both
were
most
entirely
forgotten
or
despised
pascal
a
philosopher
whom
we
both
love
has
said
how
truly
tout
notre
raisonnement
se
réduit
à
céder
au
sentiment
and
it
is
not
impossible
that
the
sentiment
of
the
natural
had
time
permitted
it
would
have
regained
its
old
ascendency
over
the
harsh
mathematical
reason
of
the
schools
but
this
thing
was
not
to
be
prematurely
induced
by
intemperance
of
knowledge
the
old
age
of
the
world
drew
near
this
the
mass
of
mankind
saw
not
or
living
lustily
although
unhappily
affected
not
to
see
but
for
myself
the
earth
records
had
taught
me
to
look
for
widest
ruin
as
the
price
of
highest
civilization
i
had
imbibed
a
prescience
of
our
fate
from
comparison
of
china
the
simple
and
enduring
with
assyria
the
architect
with
egypt
the
astrologer
with
nubia
more
crafty
than
either
the
turbulent
mother
of
all
arts
in
the
history
of
these
regions
i
met
with
a
ray
from
the
future
the
individual
artificialities
of
the
three
latter
were
local
diseases
of
the
earth
and
in
their
individual
overthrows
we
had
seen
local
remedies
applied
but
for
the
infected
world
at
large
i
could
anticipate
no
regeneration
save
in
death
that
man
as
a
race
should
not
become
extinct
i
saw
that
he
must
be
and
now
it
was
fairest
and
dearest
that
we
wrapped
our
spirits
daily
in
dreams
now
it
was
that
in
twilight
we
discoursed
of
the
days
to
come
when
the
surface
of
the
earth
having
undergone
that
purification
which
alone
could
efface
its
rectangular
obscenities
should
clothe
itself
anew
in
the
verdure
and
the
and
the
smiling
waters
of
paradise
and
be
rendered
at
length
a
fit
for
man
for
man
the
for
man
to
whose
now
exalted
intellect
there
should
be
poison
in
knowledge
no
more
for
the
redeemed
regenerated
blissful
and
now
immortal
but
still
for
the
man
well
do
i
remember
these
conversations
dear
monos
but
the
epoch
of
the
fiery
overthrow
was
not
so
near
at
hand
as
we
believed
and
as
the
corruption
you
indicate
did
surely
warrant
us
in
believing
men
lived
and
died
individually
you
yourself
sickened
and
passed
into
the
grave
and
thither
your
constant
una
speedily
followed
you
and
though
the
century
which
has
since
elapsed
and
whose
conclusion
brings
up
together
once
more
tortured
our
slumbering
senses
with
no
impatience
of
duration
yet
my
monos
it
was
a
century
still
say
rather
a
point
in
the
vague
infinity
unquestionably
it
was
in
the
earth
dotage
that
i
died
wearied
at
heart
with
anxieties
which
had
their
origin
in
the
general
turmoil
and
decay
i
succumbed
to
the
fierce
fever
after
some
few
days
of
pain
and
many
of
dreamy
delirium
replete
with
ecstasy
the
manifestations
of
which
you
mistook
for
pain
while
i
longed
but
was
impotent
to
undeceive
you
after
some
days
there
came
upon
me
as
you
have
said
a
breathless
and
motionless
torpor
and
this
was
termed
by
those
who
stood
around
me
words
are
vague
things
my
condition
did
not
deprive
me
of
sentience
it
appeared
to
me
not
greatly
dissimilar
to
the
extreme
quiescence
of
him
who
having
slumbered
long
and
profoundly
lying
motionless
and
fully
prostrate
in
a
noon
begins
to
steal
slowly
back
into
consciousness
through
the
mere
sufficiency
of
his
sleep
and
without
being
awakened
by
external
disturbances
i
breathed
no
longer
the
pulses
were
still
the
heart
had
ceased
to
beat
volition
had
not
departed
but
was
powerless
the
senses
were
unusually
active
although
eccentrically
so
assuming
often
each
other
functions
at
random
the
taste
and
the
smell
were
inextricably
confounded
and
became
one
sentiment
abnormal
and
intense
the
with
which
your
tenderness
had
moistened
my
lips
to
the
last
affected
me
with
sweet
fancies
of
flowers
fantastic
flowers
far
more
lovely
than
any
of
the
old
earth
but
whose
prototypes
we
have
here
blooming
around
us
the
transparent
and
bloodless
offered
no
complete
impediment
to
vision
as
volition
was
in
abeyance
the
balls
could
not
roll
in
their
sockets
but
all
objects
within
the
range
of
the
visual
hemisphere
were
seen
with
more
or
less
distinctness
the
rays
which
fell
upon
the
external
retina
or
into
the
corner
of
the
eye
producing
a
more
vivid
effect
than
those
which
struck
the
front
or
interior
surface
yet
in
the
former
instance
this
effect
was
so
far
anomalous
that
i
appreciated
it
only
as
sound
sweet
or
discordant
as
the
matters
presenting
themselves
at
my
side
were
light
or
dark
in
shade
curved
or
angular
in
outline
the
hearing
at
the
same
time
although
excited
in
degree
was
not
irregular
in
action
estimating
real
sounds
with
an
extravagance
of
precision
not
less
than
of
sensibility
touch
had
undergone
a
modification
more
peculiar
its
impressions
were
tardily
received
but
pertinaciously
retained
and
resulted
always
in
the
highest
physical
pleasure
thus
the
pressure
of
your
sweet
fingers
upon
my
eyelids
at
first
only
recognized
through
vision
at
length
long
after
their
removal
filled
my
whole
being
with
a
sensual
delight
immeasurable
i
say
with
a
sensual
delight
my
perceptions
were
purely
sensual
the
materials
furnished
the
passive
brain
by
the
senses
were
not
in
the
least
degree
wrought
into
shape
by
the
deceased
understanding
of
pain
there
was
some
little
of
pleasure
there
was
much
but
of
moral
pain
or
pleasure
none
at
all
thus
your
wild
sobs
floated
into
my
ear
with
all
their
mournful
cadences
and
were
appreciated
in
their
every
variation
of
sad
tone
but
they
were
soft
musical
sounds
and
no
more
they
conveyed
to
the
extinct
reason
no
intimation
of
the
sorrows
which
gave
them
birth
while
large
and
constant
tears
which
fell
upon
my
face
telling
the
bystanders
of
a
heart
which
broke
thrilled
every
fibre
of
my
frame
with
ecstasy
alone
and
this
was
in
truth
the
of
which
these
bystanders
spoke
reverently
in
low
whispers
you
sweet
una
gaspingly
with
loud
cries
they
attired
me
for
the
coffin
three
or
four
dark
figures
which
flitted
busily
to
and
fro
as
these
crossed
the
direct
line
of
my
vision
they
affected
me
as
but
upon
passing
to
my
side
their
images
impressed
me
with
the
idea
of
shrieks
groans
and
other
dismal
expressions
of
terror
of
horror
or
of
woe
you
alone
habited
in
a
white
robe
passed
in
all
directions
musically
about
the
day
waned
and
as
its
light
faded
away
i
became
possessed
by
a
vague
uneasiness
an
anxiety
such
as
the
sleeper
feels
when
sad
real
sounds
fall
continuously
within
his
ear
low
distant
solemn
at
long
but
equal
intervals
and
commingling
with
melancholy
dreams
night
arrived
and
with
its
shadows
a
heavy
discomfort
it
oppressed
my
limbs
with
the
oppression
of
some
dull
weight
and
was
palpable
there
was
also
a
moaning
sound
not
unlike
the
distant
reverberation
of
surf
but
more
continuous
which
beginning
with
the
first
twilight
had
grown
in
strength
with
the
darkness
suddenly
lights
were
brought
into
the
rooms
and
this
reverberation
became
forthwith
interrupted
into
frequent
unequal
bursts
of
the
same
sound
but
less
dreary
and
less
distinct
the
ponderous
oppression
was
in
a
great
measure
relieved
and
issuing
from
the
flame
of
each
lamp
for
there
were
many
there
flowed
unbrokenly
into
my
ears
a
strain
of
melodious
monotone
and
when
now
dear
una
approaching
the
bed
upon
which
i
lay
outstretched
you
sat
gently
by
my
side
breathing
odor
from
your
sweet
lips
and
pressing
them
upon
my
brow
there
arose
tremulously
within
my
bosom
and
mingling
with
the
merely
physical
sensations
which
circumstances
had
called
forth
a
something
akin
to
sentiment
itself
a
feeling
that
half
appreciating
half
responded
to
your
earnest
love
and
sorrow
but
this
feeling
took
no
root
in
the
pulseless
heart
and
seemed
indeed
rather
a
shadow
than
a
reality
and
faded
quickly
away
first
into
extreme
quiescence
and
then
into
a
purely
sensual
pleasure
as
before
and
now
from
the
wreck
and
the
chaos
of
the
usual
senses
there
appeared
to
have
arisen
within
me
a
sixth
all
perfect
in
its
exercise
i
found
a
wild
delight
yet
a
delight
still
physical
inasmuch
as
the
understanding
had
in
it
no
part
motion
in
the
animal
frame
had
fully
ceased
no
muscle
quivered
no
nerve
thrilled
no
artery
throbbed
but
there
seemed
to
have
sprung
up
in
the
brain
of
which
no
words
could
convey
to
the
merely
human
intelligence
even
an
indistinct
conception
let
me
term
it
a
mental
pendulous
pulsation
it
was
the
moral
embodiment
of
man
abstract
idea
of
by
the
absolute
equalization
of
this
movement
or
of
such
as
this
had
the
cycles
of
the
firmamental
orbs
themselves
been
adjusted
by
its
aid
i
measured
the
irregularities
of
the
clock
upon
the
mantel
and
of
the
watches
of
the
attendants
their
tickings
came
sonorously
to
my
ears
the
slightest
deviations
from
the
true
proportion
and
these
deviations
were
omniprevalent
affected
me
just
as
violations
of
abstract
truth
were
wont
on
earth
to
affect
the
moral
sense
although
no
two
of
the
timepieces
in
the
chamber
struck
the
individual
seconds
accurately
together
yet
i
had
no
difficulty
in
holding
steadily
in
mind
the
tones
and
the
respective
momentary
errors
of
each
and
this
this
keen
perfect
sentiment
of
this
sentiment
existing
as
man
could
not
possibly
have
conceived
it
to
exist
independently
of
any
succession
of
events
this
idea
this
sixth
sense
upspringing
from
the
ashes
of
the
rest
was
the
first
obvious
and
certain
step
of
the
intemporal
soul
upon
the
threshold
of
the
temporal
eternity
it
was
midnight
and
you
still
sat
by
my
side
all
others
had
departed
from
the
chamber
of
death
they
had
deposited
me
in
the
coffin
the
lamps
burned
flickeringly
for
this
i
knew
by
the
tremulousness
of
the
monotonous
strains
but
suddenly
these
strains
diminished
in
distinctness
and
in
volume
finally
they
ceased
the
perfume
in
my
nostrils
died
away
forms
affected
my
vision
no
longer
the
oppression
of
the
darkness
uplifted
itself
from
my
bosom
a
dull
shot
like
that
of
electricity
pervaded
my
frame
and
was
followed
by
total
loss
of
the
idea
of
contact
all
of
what
man
has
termed
sense
was
merged
in
the
sole
consciousness
of
entity
and
in
the
one
abiding
sentiment
of
duration
the
mortal
body
had
been
at
length
stricken
with
the
hand
of
the
deadly
yet
had
not
all
of
sentience
departed
for
the
consciousness
and
the
sentiment
remaining
supplied
some
of
its
functions
by
a
lethargic
intuition
i
appreciated
the
direful
change
now
in
operation
upon
the
flesh
and
as
the
dreamer
is
sometimes
aware
of
the
bodily
presence
of
one
who
leans
over
him
so
sweet
una
i
still
dully
felt
that
you
sat
by
my
side
so
too
when
the
noon
of
the
second
day
came
i
was
not
unconscious
of
those
movements
which
displaced
you
from
my
side
which
confined
me
within
the
coffin
which
deposited
me
within
the
hearse
which
bore
me
to
the
grave
which
lowered
me
within
it
which
heaped
heavily
the
mould
upon
me
and
which
thus
left
me
in
blackness
and
corruption
to
my
sad
and
solemn
slumbers
with
the
worm
and
here
in
the
which
has
few
secrets
to
disclose
there
rolled
away
days
and
weeks
and
months
and
the
soul
watched
narrowly
each
second
as
it
flew
and
without
effort
took
record
of
its
flight
without
effort
and
without
object
a
year
passed
the
consciousness
of
had
grown
hourly
more
indistinct
and
that
of
mere
had
in
great
measure
usurped
its
position
the
idea
of
entity
was
becoming
merged
in
that
of
the
narrow
space
immediately
surrounding
what
had
been
the
body
was
now
growing
to
be
the
body
itself
at
length
as
often
happens
to
the
sleeper
by
sleep
and
its
world
alone
is
imaged
at
length
as
sometimes
happened
on
earth
to
the
deep
slumberer
when
some
flitting
light
half
startled
him
into
awaking
yet
left
him
half
enveloped
in
dreams
so
to
me
in
the
strict
embrace
of
the
came
light
which
alone
might
have
had
power
to
startle
the
light
of
enduring
men
toiled
at
the
grave
in
which
i
lay
darkling
they
upthrew
the
damp
earth
upon
my
mouldering
bones
there
descended
the
coffin
of
una
and
now
again
all
was
void
that
nebulous
light
had
been
extinguished
that
feeble
thrill
had
vibrated
itself
into
quiescence
many
had
supervened
dust
had
returned
to
dust
the
worm
had
food
no
more
the
sense
of
being
had
at
length
utterly
departed
and
there
reigned
in
its
stead
instead
of
all
things
dominant
and
perpetual
the
autocrats
and
for
which
for
that
which
had
no
form
for
that
which
had
no
thought
for
that
which
had
no
sentience
for
that
which
was
soundless
yet
of
which
matter
formed
no
portion
for
all
this
nothingness
yet
for
all
this
immortality
the
grave
was
still
a
home
and
the
corrosive
hours
footnote
it
will
be
hard
to
discover
a
better
method
of
education
than
that
which
the
experience
of
so
many
ages
has
already
discovered
and
this
may
be
summed
up
as
consisting
in
gymnastics
for
the
body
and
for
the
soul
repub
lib
for
this
reason
is
a
musical
education
most
essential
since
it
causes
rhythm
and
harmony
to
penetrate
most
intimately
into
the
soul
taking
the
strongest
hold
upon
it
filling
it
with
and
making
the
man
he
will
praise
and
admire
will
receive
it
with
joy
into
his
soul
will
feed
upon
it
and
his
own
condition
with
ibid
lib
music
had
however
among
the
athenians
a
far
more
comprehensive
signification
than
with
us
it
included
not
only
the
harmonies
of
time
and
of
tune
but
the
poetic
diction
sentiment
and
creation
each
in
its
widest
sense
the
study
of
was
with
them
in
fact
the
general
cultivation
of
the
taste
of
that
which
recognizes
the
beautiful
in
contradistinction
from
reason
which
deals
only
with
the
true
the
conversation
of
eiros
and
charmion
i
will
bring
fire
to
thee
why
do
you
call
me
eiros
so
henceforward
will
you
always
be
called
you
must
forget
too
earthly
name
and
speak
to
me
as
charmion
this
is
indeed
no
dream
dreams
are
with
us
no
more
but
of
these
mysteries
anon
i
rejoice
to
see
you
looking
and
rational
the
film
of
the
shadow
has
already
passed
from
off
your
eyes
be
of
heart
and
fear
nothing
your
allotted
days
of
stupor
have
expired
and
i
will
myself
induct
you
into
the
full
joys
and
wonders
of
your
novel
existence
true
i
feel
no
stupor
none
at
all
the
wild
sickness
and
the
terrible
darkness
have
left
me
and
i
hear
no
longer
that
mad
rushing
horrible
sound
like
the
voice
of
many
waters
yet
my
senses
are
bewildered
charmion
with
the
keenness
of
their
perception
of
a
few
days
will
remove
all
this
but
i
fully
understand
you
and
feel
for
you
it
is
now
ten
earthly
years
since
i
underwent
what
you
undergo
yet
the
remembrance
of
it
hangs
by
me
still
you
have
now
suffered
all
of
pain
however
which
you
will
suffer
in
aidenn
in
aidenn
in
aidenn
o
god
pity
me
charmion
i
am
overburthened
with
the
majesty
of
all
things
of
the
unknown
now
known
of
the
speculative
future
merged
in
the
august
and
certain
present
grapple
not
now
with
such
thoughts
we
will
speak
of
this
your
mind
wavers
and
its
agitation
will
find
relief
in
the
exercise
of
simple
memories
look
not
around
nor
forward
but
back
i
am
burning
with
anxiety
to
hear
the
details
of
that
stupendous
event
which
threw
you
among
us
tell
me
of
it
let
us
converse
of
familiar
things
in
the
old
familiar
language
of
the
world
which
has
so
fearfully
perished
most
fearfully
fearfully
this
is
indeed
no
dream
dreams
are
no
more
was
i
much
mourned
my
eiros
mourned
charmion
oh
deeply
to
that
last
hour
of
all
there
hung
a
cloud
of
intense
gloom
and
devout
sorrow
over
your
household
and
that
last
hour
speak
of
it
remember
that
beyond
the
naked
fact
of
the
catastrophe
itself
i
know
nothing
when
coming
out
from
among
mankind
i
passed
into
night
through
the
grave
at
that
period
if
i
remember
aright
the
calamity
which
overwhelmed
you
was
utterly
unanticipated
but
indeed
i
knew
little
of
the
speculative
philosophy
of
the
day
the
individual
calamity
was
as
you
say
entirely
unanticipated
but
analogous
misfortunes
had
been
long
a
subject
of
discussion
with
astronomers
i
need
scarce
tell
you
my
friend
that
even
when
you
left
us
men
had
agreed
to
understand
those
passages
in
the
most
holy
writings
which
speak
of
the
final
destruction
of
all
things
by
fire
as
having
reference
to
the
orb
of
the
earth
alone
but
in
regard
to
the
immediate
agency
of
the
ruin
speculation
had
been
at
fault
from
that
epoch
in
astronomical
knowledge
in
which
the
comets
were
divested
of
the
terrors
of
flame
the
very
moderate
density
of
these
bodies
had
been
well
established
they
had
been
observed
to
pass
among
the
satellites
of
jupiter
without
bringing
about
any
sensible
alteration
either
in
the
masses
or
in
the
orbits
of
these
secondary
planets
we
had
long
regarded
the
wanderers
as
vapory
creations
of
inconceivable
tenuity
and
as
altogether
incapable
of
doing
injury
to
our
substantial
globe
even
in
the
event
of
contact
but
contact
was
not
in
any
degree
dreaded
for
the
elements
of
all
the
comets
were
accurately
known
that
among
we
should
look
for
the
agency
of
the
threatened
fiery
destruction
had
been
for
many
years
considered
an
inadmissible
idea
but
wonders
and
wild
fancies
had
been
of
late
days
strangely
rife
among
mankind
and
although
it
was
only
with
a
few
of
the
ignorant
that
actual
apprehension
prevailed
upon
the
announcement
by
astronomers
of
a
comet
yet
this
announcement
was
generally
received
with
i
know
not
what
of
agitation
and
mistrust
the
elements
of
the
strange
orb
were
immediately
calculated
and
it
was
at
once
conceded
by
all
observers
that
its
path
at
perihelion
would
bring
it
into
very
close
proximity
with
the
earth
there
were
two
or
three
astronomers
of
secondary
note
who
resolutely
maintained
that
a
contact
was
inevitable
i
can
not
very
well
express
to
you
the
effect
of
this
intelligence
upon
the
people
for
a
few
short
days
they
would
not
believe
an
assertion
which
their
intellect
so
long
employed
among
worldly
considerations
could
not
in
any
manner
grasp
but
the
truth
of
a
vitally
important
fact
soon
makes
its
way
into
the
understanding
of
even
the
most
stolid
finally
all
men
saw
that
astronomical
knowledge
lies
not
and
they
awaited
the
comet
its
approach
was
not
at
first
seemingly
rapid
nor
was
its
appearance
of
very
unusual
character
it
was
of
a
dull
red
and
had
little
perceptible
train
for
seven
or
eight
days
we
saw
no
material
increase
in
its
apparent
diameter
and
but
a
partial
alteration
in
its
color
meantime
the
ordinary
affairs
of
men
were
discarded
and
all
interest
absorbed
in
a
growing
discussion
instituted
by
the
philosophic
in
respect
to
the
cometary
nature
even
the
grossly
ignorant
aroused
their
sluggish
capacities
to
such
considerations
the
learned
gave
their
intellect
their
soul
to
no
such
points
as
the
allaying
of
fear
or
to
the
sustenance
of
loved
theory
they
sought
they
panted
for
right
views
they
groaned
for
perfected
knowledge
arose
in
the
purity
of
her
strength
and
exceeding
majesty
and
the
wise
bowed
down
and
adored
that
material
injury
to
our
globe
or
to
its
inhabitants
would
result
from
the
apprehended
contact
was
an
opinion
which
hourly
lost
ground
among
the
wise
and
the
wise
were
now
freely
permitted
to
rule
the
reason
and
the
fancy
of
the
crowd
it
was
demonstrated
that
the
density
of
the
comet
was
far
less
than
that
of
our
rarest
gas
and
the
harmless
passage
of
a
similar
visitor
among
the
satellites
of
jupiter
was
a
point
strongly
insisted
upon
and
which
served
greatly
to
allay
terror
theologists
with
an
earnestness
dwelt
upon
the
biblical
prophecies
and
expounded
them
to
the
people
with
a
directness
and
simplicity
of
which
no
previous
instance
had
been
known
that
the
final
destruction
of
the
earth
must
be
brought
about
by
the
agency
of
fire
was
urged
with
a
spirit
that
enforced
everywhere
conviction
and
that
the
comets
were
of
no
fiery
nature
as
all
men
now
knew
was
a
truth
which
relieved
all
in
a
great
measure
from
the
apprehension
of
the
great
calamity
foretold
it
is
noticeable
that
the
popular
prejudices
and
vulgar
errors
in
regard
to
pestilences
and
wars
errors
which
were
wont
to
prevail
upon
every
appearance
of
a
comet
were
now
altogether
unknown
as
if
by
some
sudden
convulsive
exertion
reason
had
at
once
hurled
superstition
from
her
throne
the
feeblest
intellect
had
derived
vigor
from
excessive
interest
what
minor
evils
might
arise
from
the
contact
were
points
of
elaborate
question
the
learned
spoke
of
slight
geological
disturbances
of
probable
alterations
in
climate
and
consequently
in
vegetation
of
possible
magnetic
and
electric
influences
many
held
that
no
visible
or
perceptible
effect
would
in
any
manner
be
produced
while
such
discussions
were
going
on
their
subject
gradually
approached
growing
larger
in
apparent
diameter
and
of
a
more
brilliant
lustre
mankind
grew
paler
as
it
came
all
human
operations
were
suspended
there
was
an
epoch
in
the
course
of
the
general
sentiment
when
the
comet
had
attained
at
length
a
size
surpassing
that
of
any
previously
recorded
visitation
the
people
now
dismissing
any
lingering
hope
that
the
astronomers
were
wrong
experienced
all
the
certainty
of
evil
the
chimerical
aspect
of
their
terror
was
gone
the
hearts
of
the
stoutest
of
our
race
beat
violently
within
their
bosoms
a
very
few
days
suffered
however
to
merge
even
such
feelings
in
sentiments
more
unendurable
we
could
no
longer
apply
to
the
strange
orb
any
thoughts
its
attributes
had
disappeared
it
oppressed
us
with
a
hideous
of
emotion
we
saw
it
not
as
an
astronomical
phenomenon
in
the
heavens
but
as
an
incubus
upon
our
hearts
and
a
shadow
upon
our
brains
it
had
taken
with
unconceivable
rapidity
the
character
of
a
gigantic
mantle
of
rare
flame
extending
from
horizon
to
horizon
yet
a
day
and
men
breathed
with
greater
freedom
it
was
clear
that
we
were
already
within
the
influence
of
the
comet
yet
we
lived
we
even
felt
an
unusual
elasticity
of
frame
and
vivacity
of
mind
the
exceeding
tenuity
of
the
object
of
our
dread
was
apparent
for
all
heavenly
objects
were
plainly
visible
through
it
meantime
our
vegetation
had
perceptibly
altered
and
we
gained
faith
from
this
predicted
circumstance
in
the
foresight
of
the
wise
a
wild
luxuriance
of
foliage
utterly
unknown
before
burst
out
upon
every
vegetable
thing
yet
another
day
and
the
evil
was
not
altogether
upon
us
it
was
now
evident
that
its
nucleus
would
first
reach
us
a
wild
change
had
come
over
all
men
and
the
first
sense
of
was
the
wild
signal
for
general
lamentation
and
horror
the
first
sense
of
pain
lay
in
a
rigorous
construction
of
the
breast
and
lungs
and
an
insufferable
dryness
of
the
skin
it
could
not
be
denied
that
our
atmosphere
was
radically
affected
the
conformation
of
this
atmosphere
and
the
possible
modifications
to
which
it
might
be
subjected
were
now
the
topics
of
discussion
the
result
of
investigation
sent
an
electric
thrill
of
the
intensest
terror
through
the
universal
heart
of
man
it
had
been
long
known
that
the
air
which
encircled
us
was
a
compound
of
oxygen
and
nitrogen
gases
in
the
proportion
of
measures
of
oxygen
and
of
nitrogen
in
every
one
hundred
of
the
atmosphere
oxygen
which
was
the
principle
of
combustion
and
the
vehicle
of
heat
was
absolutely
necessary
to
the
support
of
animal
life
and
was
the
most
powerful
and
energetic
agent
in
nature
nitrogen
on
the
contrary
was
incapable
of
supporting
either
animal
life
or
flame
an
unnatural
excess
of
oxygen
would
result
it
had
been
ascertained
in
just
such
an
elevation
of
the
animal
spirits
as
we
had
latterly
experienced
it
was
the
pursuit
the
extension
of
the
idea
which
had
engendered
awe
what
would
be
the
result
of
a
extraction
of
the
a
combustion
irresistible
immediate
the
entire
fulfilment
in
all
their
minute
and
terrible
details
of
the
fiery
and
denunciations
of
the
prophecies
of
the
holy
book
why
need
i
paint
charmion
the
now
disenchained
frenzy
of
mankind
that
tenuity
in
the
comet
which
had
previously
inspired
us
with
hope
was
now
the
source
of
the
bitterness
of
despair
in
its
impalpable
gaseous
character
we
clearly
perceived
the
consummation
of
fate
meantime
a
day
again
passed
bearing
away
with
it
the
last
shadow
of
hope
we
gasped
in
the
rapid
modification
of
the
air
the
red
blood
bounded
tumultuously
through
its
strict
channels
a
furious
delirium
possessed
all
men
and
with
arms
rigidly
outstretched
towards
the
threatening
heavens
they
trembled
and
shrieked
aloud
but
the
nucleus
of
the
destroyer
was
now
upon
us
even
here
in
aidenn
i
shudder
while
i
speak
let
me
be
brief
brief
as
the
ruin
that
overwhelmed
for
a
moment
there
was
a
wild
lurid
light
alone
visiting
and
penetrating
all
things
then
let
us
bow
down
charmion
before
the
excessive
majesty
of
the
great
god
then
there
came
a
shouting
and
pervading
sound
as
if
from
the
mouth
itself
of
him
while
the
whole
incumbent
mass
of
ether
in
which
we
existed
burst
at
once
into
a
species
of
intense
flame
for
whose
surpassing
brilliancy
and
heat
even
the
angels
in
the
high
heaven
of
pure
knowledge
have
no
name
thus
ended
all
a
parable
yea
though
i
walk
through
the
valley
of
the
of
david
ye
who
read
are
still
among
the
living
but
i
who
write
shall
have
long
since
gone
my
way
into
the
region
of
shadows
for
indeed
strange
things
shall
happen
and
secret
things
be
known
and
many
centuries
shall
pass
away
ere
these
memorials
be
seen
of
men
and
when
seen
there
will
be
some
to
disbelieve
and
some
to
doubt
and
yet
a
few
who
will
find
much
to
ponder
upon
in
the
characters
here
graven
with
a
stylus
of
iron
the
year
had
been
a
year
of
terror
and
of
feeling
more
intense
than
terror
for
which
there
is
no
name
upon
the
earth
for
many
prodigies
and
signs
had
taken
place
and
far
and
wide
over
sea
and
land
the
black
wings
of
the
pestilence
were
spread
abroad
to
those
nevertheless
cunning
in
the
stars
it
was
not
unknown
that
the
heavens
wore
an
aspect
of
ill
and
to
me
the
greek
oinos
among
others
it
was
evident
that
now
had
arrived
the
alternation
of
that
seven
hundred
and
year
when
at
the
entrance
of
aries
the
planet
jupiter
is
enjoined
with
the
red
ring
of
the
terrible
saturnus
the
peculiar
spirit
of
the
skies
if
i
mistake
not
greatly
made
itself
manifest
not
only
in
the
physical
orb
of
the
earth
but
in
the
souls
imaginations
and
meditations
of
mankind
over
some
flasks
of
the
red
chian
wine
within
the
walls
of
a
noble
hall
in
a
dim
city
called
ptolemais
we
sat
at
night
a
company
of
seven
and
to
our
chamber
there
was
no
entrance
save
by
a
lofty
door
of
brass
and
the
door
was
fashioned
by
the
artisan
corinnos
and
being
of
rare
workmanship
was
fastened
from
within
black
draperies
likewise
in
the
gloomy
room
shut
out
from
our
view
the
moon
the
lurid
stars
and
the
peopleless
streets
but
the
boding
and
the
memory
of
evil
they
would
not
be
so
excluded
there
were
things
around
us
and
about
of
which
i
can
render
no
distinct
account
things
material
and
spiritual
heaviness
in
the
atmosphere
a
sense
of
suffocation
anxiety
and
above
all
that
terrible
state
of
existence
which
the
nervous
experience
when
the
senses
are
keenly
living
and
awake
and
meanwhile
the
powers
of
thought
lie
dormant
a
dead
weight
hung
upon
us
it
hung
upon
our
limbs
upon
the
household
furniture
upon
the
goblets
from
which
we
drank
and
all
things
were
depressed
and
borne
down
thereby
all
things
save
only
the
flames
of
the
seven
iron
lamps
which
illumined
our
revel
uprearing
themselves
in
tall
slender
lines
of
light
they
thus
remained
burning
all
pallid
and
motionless
and
in
the
mirror
which
their
lustre
formed
upon
the
round
table
of
ebony
at
which
we
sat
each
of
us
there
assembled
beheld
the
pallor
of
his
own
countenance
and
the
unquiet
glare
in
the
downcast
eyes
of
his
companions
yet
we
laughed
and
were
merry
in
our
proper
way
which
was
hysterical
and
sang
the
songs
of
anacreon
which
are
madness
and
drank
deeply
although
the
purple
wine
reminded
us
of
blood
for
there
was
yet
another
tenant
of
our
chamber
in
the
person
of
young
zoilus
dead
and
at
full
length
he
lay
enshrouded
the
genius
and
the
demon
of
the
scene
alas
he
bore
no
portion
in
our
mirth
save
that
his
countenance
distorted
with
the
plague
and
his
eyes
in
which
death
had
but
half
extinguished
the
fire
of
the
pestilence
seemed
to
take
such
an
interest
in
our
merriment
as
the
dead
may
haply
take
in
the
merriment
of
those
who
are
to
die
but
although
i
oinos
felt
that
the
eyes
of
the
departed
were
upon
me
still
i
forced
myself
not
to
perceive
the
bitterness
of
their
expression
and
gazing
down
steadily
into
the
depths
of
the
ebony
mirror
sang
with
a
loud
and
sonorous
voice
the
songs
of
the
son
of
teos
but
gradually
my
songs
they
ceased
and
their
echoes
rolling
afar
off
among
the
sable
draperies
of
the
chamber
became
weak
and
undistinguishable
and
so
faded
away
and
lo
from
among
those
sable
draperies
where
the
sounds
of
the
song
departed
there
came
forth
a
dark
and
undefiled
shadow
a
shadow
such
as
the
moon
when
low
in
heaven
might
fashion
from
the
figure
of
a
man
but
it
was
the
shadow
neither
of
man
nor
of
god
nor
of
any
familiar
thing
and
quivering
awhile
among
the
draperies
of
the
room
it
at
length
rested
in
full
view
upon
the
surface
of
the
door
of
brass
but
the
shadow
was
vague
and
formless
and
indefinite
and
was
the
shadow
neither
of
man
nor
god
neither
god
of
greece
nor
god
of
chaldæa
nor
any
egyptian
god
and
the
shadow
rested
upon
the
brazen
doorway
and
under
the
arch
of
the
entablature
of
the
door
and
moved
not
nor
spoke
any
word
but
there
became
stationary
and
remained
and
the
door
whereupon
the
shadow
rested
was
if
i
remember
aright
over
against
the
feet
of
the
young
zoilus
enshrouded
but
we
the
seven
there
assembled
having
seen
the
shadow
as
it
came
out
from
among
the
draperies
dared
not
steadily
behold
it
but
cast
down
our
eyes
and
gazed
continually
into
the
depths
of
the
mirror
of
ebony
and
at
length
i
oinos
speaking
some
low
words
demanded
of
the
shadow
its
dwelling
and
its
appellation
and
the
shadow
answered
i
am
shadow
and
my
dwelling
is
near
to
the
catacombs
of
ptolemais
and
hard
by
those
dim
plains
of
helusion
which
border
upon
the
foul
charonian
canal
and
then
did
we
the
seven
start
from
our
seats
in
horror
and
stand
trembling
and
shuddering
and
aghast
for
the
tones
in
the
voice
of
the
shadow
were
not
the
tones
of
any
one
being
but
of
a
multitude
of
beings
and
varying
in
their
cadences
from
syllable
to
syllable
fell
duskily
upon
our
ears
in
the
well
remembered
and
familiar
accents
of
many
thousand
departed
friends
a
fable
the
mountain
pinnacles
slumber
valleys
crags
and
caves
listen
to
said
the
demon
as
he
placed
his
hand
upon
my
head
the
region
of
which
i
speak
is
a
dreary
region
in
libya
by
the
borders
of
the
river
zäire
and
there
is
no
quiet
there
nor
silence
the
waters
of
the
river
have
a
saffron
and
sickly
hue
and
they
flow
not
onward
to
the
sea
but
palpitate
forever
and
forever
beneath
the
red
eye
of
the
sun
with
a
tumultuous
and
convulsive
motion
for
many
miles
on
either
side
of
the
river
oozy
bed
is
a
pale
desert
of
gigantic
they
sigh
one
unto
the
other
in
that
solitude
and
stretch
towards
the
heaven
their
long
and
ghastly
necks
and
nod
to
and
fro
their
everlasting
heads
and
there
is
an
indistinct
murmur
which
cometh
out
from
among
them
like
the
rushing
of
subterrene
water
and
they
sigh
one
unto
the
other
but
there
is
a
boundary
to
their
realm
the
boundary
of
the
dark
horrible
lofty
forest
there
like
the
waves
about
the
hebrides
the
low
underwood
is
agitated
continually
but
there
is
no
wind
throughout
the
heaven
and
the
tall
primeval
trees
rock
eternally
hither
and
thither
with
a
crashing
and
mighty
sound
and
from
their
high
summits
one
by
one
drop
everlasting
dews
and
at
the
roots
strange
poisonous
flowers
lie
writhing
in
perturbed
slumber
and
overhead
with
a
rustling
and
loud
noise
the
gray
clouds
rush
westwardly
forever
until
they
roll
a
cataract
over
the
fiery
wall
of
the
horizon
but
there
is
no
wind
throughout
the
heaven
and
by
the
shores
of
the
river
zäire
there
is
neither
quiet
nor
silence
it
was
night
and
the
rain
fell
and
falling
it
was
rain
but
having
fallen
it
was
blood
and
i
stood
in
the
morass
among
the
tall
lilies
and
the
rain
fell
upon
my
head
and
the
lilies
sighed
one
unto
the
other
in
the
solemnity
of
their
desolation
and
all
at
once
the
moon
arose
through
the
thin
ghastly
mist
and
was
crimson
in
color
and
mine
eyes
fell
upon
a
huge
gray
rock
which
stood
by
the
shore
of
the
river
and
was
lighted
by
the
light
of
the
moon
and
the
rock
was
gray
and
ghastly
and
tall
and
the
rock
was
gray
upon
its
front
were
characters
engraven
in
the
stones
and
i
walked
through
the
morass
of
until
i
came
close
unto
the
shore
that
i
might
read
the
characters
upon
the
stone
but
i
could
not
decipher
them
and
i
was
going
back
into
the
morass
when
the
moon
shone
with
a
fuller
red
and
i
turned
and
looked
again
upon
the
rock
and
upon
the
characters
and
the
characters
were
desolation
and
i
looked
upwards
and
there
stood
a
man
upon
the
summit
of
the
rock
and
i
hid
myself
among
the
that
i
might
discover
the
action
of
the
man
and
the
man
was
tall
and
stately
in
form
and
wrapped
up
from
his
shoulders
to
his
feet
in
the
toga
of
old
rome
and
the
outlines
of
his
figure
were
indistinct
but
his
features
were
the
features
of
a
deity
for
the
mantle
of
the
night
and
of
the
mist
and
of
the
moon
and
of
the
dew
had
left
uncovered
the
features
of
his
face
and
his
brow
was
lofty
with
thought
and
his
eye
wild
with
care
and
in
the
few
furrows
upon
his
cheek
i
read
the
fables
of
sorrow
and
weariness
and
disgust
with
mankind
and
a
longing
after
solitude
and
the
man
sat
upon
the
rock
and
leaned
his
head
upon
his
hand
and
looked
out
upon
the
desolation
he
looked
down
into
the
low
unquiet
shrubbery
and
up
into
the
tall
primeval
trees
and
up
higher
at
the
rustling
heaven
and
into
the
crimson
moon
and
i
lay
close
within
shelter
of
the
lilies
and
observed
the
actions
of
the
man
and
the
man
trembled
in
the
solitude
but
the
night
waned
and
he
sat
upon
the
rock
and
the
man
turned
his
attention
from
the
heaven
and
looked
out
upon
the
dreary
river
zäire
and
upon
the
yellow
ghastly
waters
and
upon
the
pale
legions
of
the
and
the
man
listened
to
the
sighs
of
the
and
to
the
murmur
that
came
up
from
among
them
and
i
lay
close
within
my
covert
and
observed
the
actions
of
the
man
and
the
man
trembled
in
the
solitude
but
the
night
waned
and
he
sat
upon
the
rock
then
i
went
down
into
the
recesses
of
the
morass
and
waded
afar
in
among
the
wilderness
of
the
lilies
and
called
unto
the
hippopotami
which
dwelt
among
the
fens
in
the
recesses
of
the
morass
and
the
hippopotami
heard
my
call
and
came
with
the
behemoth
unto
the
foot
of
the
rock
and
roared
loudly
and
fearfully
beneath
the
moon
and
i
lay
close
within
my
covert
and
observed
the
actions
of
the
man
and
the
man
trembled
in
the
solitude
but
the
night
waned
and
he
sat
upon
the
rock
then
i
cursed
the
elements
with
the
curse
of
tumult
and
a
frightful
tempest
gathered
in
the
heaven
where
before
there
had
been
no
wind
and
the
heaven
became
livid
with
the
violence
of
the
tempest
and
the
rain
beat
upon
the
head
of
the
man
and
the
floods
of
the
river
came
down
and
the
river
was
tormented
into
foam
and
the
shrieked
within
their
beds
and
the
forest
crumbled
before
the
wind
and
the
thunder
rolled
and
the
lightning
fell
and
the
rock
rocked
to
its
foundation
and
i
lay
close
within
my
covert
and
observed
the
actions
of
the
man
and
the
man
trembled
in
the
solitude
but
the
night
waned
and
he
sat
upon
the
rock
then
i
grew
angry
and
cursed
with
the
curse
of
silence
the
river
and
the
lilies
and
the
wind
and
the
forest
and
the
heaven
and
the
thunder
and
the
sighs
of
the
and
they
became
accursed
and
and
the
moon
ceased
to
totter
up
its
pathway
to
heaven
and
the
thunder
died
away
and
the
lightning
did
not
flash
and
the
clouds
hung
motionless
and
the
waters
sunk
to
their
level
and
remained
and
the
trees
ceased
to
rock
and
the
sighed
no
more
and
the
murmur
was
heard
no
longer
from
among
them
nor
any
shadow
of
sound
throughout
the
vast
illimitable
desert
and
i
looked
upon
the
characters
of
the
rock
and
they
were
changed
and
the
characters
were
silence
and
mine
eyes
fell
upon
the
countenance
of
the
man
and
his
countenance
was
wan
with
terror
and
hurriedly
he
raised
his
head
from
his
hand
and
stood
forth
upon
the
rock
and
listened
but
there
was
no
voice
throughout
the
vast
illimitable
desert
and
the
characters
upon
the
rock
were
silence
and
the
man
shuddered
and
turned
his
face
away
and
fled
afar
off
in
haste
so
that
i
beheld
him
no
more
now
there
are
fine
tales
in
the
volumes
of
the
magi
in
the
melancholy
volumes
of
the
magi
therein
i
say
are
glorious
histories
of
the
heaven
and
of
the
earth
and
of
the
mighty
sea
and
of
the
genii
that
overruled
the
sea
and
the
earth
and
the
lofty
heaven
there
was
much
lore
too
in
the
sayings
which
were
said
by
the
sybils
and
holy
holy
things
were
heard
of
old
by
the
dim
leaves
that
trembled
around
dodona
but
as
allah
liveth
that
fable
which
the
demon
told
me
as
he
sat
by
my
side
in
the
shadow
of
the
tomb
i
hold
to
be
the
most
wonderful
of
all
and
as
the
demon
made
an
end
of
his
story
he
fell
back
within
the
cavity
of
the
tomb
and
laughed
and
i
could
not
laugh
with
the
demon
and
he
cursed
me
because
i
could
not
laugh
and
the
lynx
which
dwelleth
forever
in
the
tomb
came
out
therefrom
and
lay
down
at
the
feet
of
the
demon
and
looked
at
him
steadily
in
the
face
essays
the
poetic
principle
in
speaking
of
the
poetic
principle
i
have
no
design
to
be
either
thorough
or
profound
while
discussing
very
much
at
random
the
essentiality
of
what
we
call
poetry
my
principal
purpose
will
be
to
cite
for
consideration
some
few
of
those
minor
english
or
american
poems
which
best
suit
my
own
taste
or
which
upon
my
own
fancy
have
left
the
most
definite
impression
by
minor
poems
i
mean
of
course
poems
of
little
length
and
here
in
the
beginning
permit
me
to
say
a
few
words
in
regard
to
a
somewhat
peculiar
principle
which
whether
rightfully
or
wrongfully
has
always
had
its
influence
in
my
own
critical
estimate
of
the
poem
i
hold
that
a
long
poem
does
not
exist
i
maintain
that
the
phrase
a
long
poem
is
simply
a
flat
contradiction
in
terms
i
need
scarcely
observe
that
a
poem
deserves
its
title
only
inasmuch
as
it
excites
by
elevating
the
soul
the
value
of
the
poem
is
in
the
ratio
of
this
elevating
excitement
but
all
excitements
are
through
a
psychal
necessity
transient
that
degree
of
excitement
which
would
entitle
a
poem
to
be
so
called
at
all
can
not
be
sustained
throughout
a
composition
of
any
great
length
after
the
lapse
of
half
an
hour
at
the
very
utmost
it
flags
fails
a
revulsion
ensues
and
then
the
poem
is
in
effect
and
in
fact
no
longer
such
there
are
no
doubt
many
who
have
found
difficulty
in
reconciling
the
critical
dictum
that
the
paradise
lost
is
to
be
devoutly
admired
throughout
with
the
absolute
impossibility
of
maintaining
for
it
during
perusal
the
amount
of
enthusiasm
which
that
critical
dictum
would
demand
this
great
work
in
fact
is
to
be
regarded
as
poetical
only
when
losing
sight
of
that
vital
requisite
in
all
works
of
art
unity
we
view
it
merely
as
a
series
of
minor
poems
if
to
preserve
its
unity
its
totality
of
effect
or
impression
we
read
it
as
would
be
necessary
at
a
single
sitting
the
result
is
but
a
constant
alternation
of
excitement
and
depression
after
a
passage
of
what
we
feel
to
be
true
poetry
there
follows
inevitably
a
passage
of
platitude
which
no
critical
prejudgment
can
force
us
to
admire
but
if
upon
completing
the
work
we
read
it
again
omitting
the
first
book
that
is
to
say
commencing
with
the
second
we
shall
be
surprised
at
now
finding
that
admirable
which
we
before
condemned
that
damnable
which
we
had
previously
so
much
admired
it
follows
from
all
this
that
the
ultimate
aggregate
or
absolute
effect
of
even
the
best
epic
under
the
sun
is
a
nullity
and
this
is
precisely
the
fact
in
regard
to
the
iliad
we
have
if
not
positive
proof
at
least
very
good
reason
for
believing
it
intended
as
a
series
of
lyrics
but
granting
the
epic
intention
i
can
say
only
that
the
work
is
based
in
an
imperfect
sense
of
art
the
modern
epic
is
of
the
supposititious
ancient
model
but
an
inconsiderate
and
blindfold
imitation
but
the
day
of
these
artistic
anomalies
is
over
if
at
any
time
any
very
long
poem
popular
in
reality
which
i
doubt
it
is
at
least
clear
that
no
very
long
poem
will
ever
be
popular
again
that
the
extent
of
a
poetical
work
is
the
measure
of
its
merit
seems
undoubtedly
when
we
thus
state
it
a
proposition
sufficiently
absurd
yet
we
are
indebted
for
it
to
the
quarterly
reviews
surely
there
can
be
nothing
in
mere
abstractly
considered
there
can
be
nothing
in
mere
so
far
as
a
volume
is
concerned
which
has
so
continuously
elicited
admiration
from
these
saturnine
pamphlets
a
mountain
to
be
sure
by
the
mere
sentiment
of
physical
magnitude
which
it
conveys
impress
us
with
a
sense
of
the
sublime
but
no
man
is
impressed
after
fashion
by
the
material
grandeur
of
even
the
columbiad
even
the
quarterlies
have
not
instructed
us
to
be
so
impressed
by
it
they
have
not
on
our
estimating
lamartine
by
the
cubic
foot
or
pollock
by
the
pound
but
what
else
are
we
to
from
their
continual
prating
about
sustained
effort
if
by
sustained
effort
any
little
gentleman
has
accomplished
an
epic
let
us
frankly
commend
him
for
the
effort
if
this
indeed
be
a
thing
commendable
but
let
us
forbear
praising
the
epic
on
the
effort
account
it
is
to
be
hoped
thai
common
sense
in
the
time
to
come
will
prefer
deciding
upon
a
work
of
art
rather
by
the
impression
it
makes
by
the
effect
it
produces
than
by
the
time
it
took
to
impress
the
effect
or
by
the
amount
of
sustained
effort
which
had
been
found
necessary
in
effecting
the
impression
the
fact
is
that
perseverance
is
one
thing
and
genius
quite
another
nor
can
all
the
quarterlies
in
christendom
confound
them
by
and
by
this
proposition
with
many
which
i
have
been
just
urging
will
be
received
as
in
the
meantime
by
being
generally
condemned
as
falsities
they
will
not
be
essentially
damaged
as
truths
on
the
other
hand
it
is
clear
that
a
poem
may
be
improperly
brief
undue
brevity
degenerates
into
mere
epigrammatism
a
short
poem
while
now
and
then
producing
a
brilliant
or
vivid
never
produces
a
profound
or
enduring
effect
there
must
be
the
steady
pressing
down
of
the
stamp
upon
the
wax
de
béranger
has
wrought
innumerable
things
pungent
and
but
in
general
they
have
been
too
imponderous
to
stamp
themselves
deeply
into
the
public
attention
and
thus
as
so
many
feathers
of
fancy
have
been
blown
aloft
only
to
be
whistled
down
the
wind
a
remarkable
instance
of
the
effect
of
undue
brevity
in
depressing
a
poem
in
keeping
it
out
of
the
popular
view
is
afforded
by
the
following
exquisite
little
serenade
i
arise
from
dreams
of
thee
in
the
first
sweet
sleep
of
night
when
the
winds
are
breathing
low
and
the
stars
are
shining
bright
i
arise
from
dreams
of
thee
and
a
spirit
in
my
feet
has
led
me
who
knows
how
to
thy
sweet
the
wandering
airs
they
faint
on
the
dark
the
silent
stream
the
champak
odors
fail
like
sweet
thoughts
in
a
dream
the
nightingale
complaint
it
dies
upon
her
heart
as
i
must
die
on
thine
o
beloved
as
thou
art
o
lift
me
from
the
grass
i
die
i
faint
i
fail
let
thy
love
in
kisses
rain
on
my
lips
and
eyelids
pale
my
cheek
is
cold
and
white
alas
my
heart
beats
loud
and
fast
o
press
it
close
to
thine
again
where
it
will
break
at
last
very
few
perhaps
are
familiar
with
these
lines
yet
no
less
a
poet
than
shelley
is
their
author
their
warm
yet
delicate
and
ethereal
imagination
will
be
appreciated
by
all
but
by
none
so
thoroughly
as
by
him
who
has
himself
arisen
from
sweet
dreams
of
one
beloved
to
bathe
in
the
aromatic
air
of
a
southern
midsummer
night
one
of
the
finest
poems
by
willis
the
very
best
in
my
opinion
which
he
has
ever
written
has
no
doubt
through
this
same
defect
of
undue
brevity
been
kept
back
from
its
proper
position
not
less
in
the
critical
than
in
the
popular
view
the
shadows
lay
along
broadway
was
near
the
and
slowly
there
a
lady
fair
was
walking
in
her
pride
alone
walk
she
but
viewlessly
walk
spirits
at
her
side
peace
charm
the
street
beneath
her
feet
and
honor
charm
the
air
and
all
astir
looked
kind
on
her
and
called
her
good
as
fair
for
all
god
ever
gave
to
her
she
kept
with
chary
care
she
kept
with
care
her
beauties
rare
from
lovers
warm
and
true
for
heart
was
cold
to
all
but
gold
and
the
rich
came
not
to
woo
but
honor
well
her
charms
to
sell
if
priests
the
selling
do
now
walking
there
was
one
more
fair
a
slight
girl
and
she
had
unseen
company
to
make
the
spirit
quail
twixt
want
and
scorn
she
walk
forlorn
and
nothing
could
avail
no
mercy
now
can
clear
her
brow
from
this
world
peace
to
pray
for
as
love
wild
prayer
dissolved
in
air
her
woman
heart
gave
way
but
the
sin
forgiven
by
christ
in
heaven
by
man
is
cursed
alway
in
this
composition
we
find
it
difficult
to
recognise
the
willis
who
has
written
so
many
mere
verses
of
society
the
lines
are
not
only
richly
ideal
but
full
of
energy
while
they
breathe
an
earnestness
an
evident
sincerity
of
sentiment
for
which
we
look
in
vain
throughout
all
the
other
works
of
this
author
while
the
epic
mania
while
the
idea
that
to
merit
in
poetry
prolixity
is
indispensable
has
for
some
years
past
been
gradually
dying
out
of
the
public
mind
by
mere
dint
of
its
own
absurdity
we
find
it
succeeded
by
a
heresy
too
palpably
false
to
be
long
tolerated
but
one
which
in
the
brief
period
it
has
already
endured
may
be
said
to
have
accomplished
more
in
the
corruption
of
our
poetical
literature
than
all
its
other
enemies
combined
i
allude
to
the
heresy
of
it
has
been
assumed
tacitly
and
avowedly
directly
and
indirectly
that
the
ultimate
object
of
all
poetry
is
truth
every
poem
it
is
said
should
inculcate
a
moral
and
by
this
moral
is
the
poetical
merit
of
the
work
to
be
adjudged
we
americans
especially
have
patronized
this
happy
idea
and
we
bostonians
very
especially
have
developed
it
in
full
we
have
taken
it
into
our
heads
that
to
write
a
poem
simply
for
the
sake
and
to
acknowledge
such
to
have
been
our
design
would
be
to
confess
ourselves
radically
wanting
in
the
true
poetic
dignity
and
force
but
the
simple
fact
is
that
would
we
but
permit
ourselves
to
look
into
our
own
souls
we
should
immediately
there
discover
that
under
the
sun
there
neither
exists
nor
exist
any
work
more
thoroughly
dignified
more
supremely
noble
than
this
very
poem
this
poem
this
poem
which
is
a
poem
and
nothing
more
this
poem
written
solely
for
the
poem
sake
with
as
deep
a
reverence
for
the
true
as
ever
inspired
the
bosom
of
man
i
would
nevertheless
limit
in
some
measure
its
modes
of
inculcation
i
would
limit
to
enforce
them
i
would
not
enfeeble
them
by
dissipation
the
demands
of
truth
are
severe
she
has
no
sympathy
with
the
myrtles
all
which
is
so
indispensable
in
song
is
precisely
all
with
which
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
it
is
but
making
her
a
flaunting
paradox
to
wreathe
her
in
gems
and
flowers
in
enforcing
a
truth
we
need
severity
rather
than
efflorescence
of
language
we
must
be
simple
precise
terse
we
must
be
cool
calm
unimpassioned
in
a
word
we
must
be
in
that
mood
which
as
nearly
as
possible
is
the
exact
converse
of
the
poetical
must
be
blind
indeed
who
does
not
perceive
the
radical
and
chasmal
difference
between
the
truthful
and
the
poetical
modes
of
inculcation
he
must
be
beyond
redemption
who
in
spite
of
these
differences
shall
still
persist
in
attempting
to
reconcile
the
obstinate
oils
and
waters
of
poetry
and
truth
dividing
the
world
of
mind
into
its
three
most
immediately
obvious
distinctions
we
have
the
pure
intellect
taste
and
the
moral
sense
i
place
taste
in
the
middle
because
it
is
just
this
position
which
in
the
mind
it
occupies
it
holds
intimate
relations
with
either
extreme
but
from
the
moral
sense
is
separated
by
so
faint
a
difference
that
aristotle
has
not
hesitated
to
place
some
of
its
operations
among
the
virtues
themselves
nevertheless
we
find
the
of
the
trio
marked
with
a
sufficient
distinction
just
as
the
intellect
concerns
itself
with
truth
so
taste
informs
us
of
the
beautiful
while
the
moral
sense
is
regardful
of
duty
of
this
latter
while
conscience
teaches
the
obligation
and
reason
the
expediency
taste
contents
herself
with
displaying
the
charms
waging
war
upon
vice
solely
on
the
ground
of
her
deformity
her
disproportion
her
animosity
to
the
fitting
to
the
appropriate
to
the
harmonious
in
a
word
to
beauty
an
immortal
instinct
deep
within
the
spirit
of
man
is
thus
plainly
a
sense
of
the
beautiful
this
it
is
which
administers
to
his
delight
in
the
manifold
forms
and
sounds
and
odors
and
sentiments
amid
which
he
exists
and
just
as
the
lily
is
repeated
in
the
lake
or
the
eyes
of
amaryllis
in
the
mirror
so
is
the
mere
oral
or
written
repetition
of
these
forms
and
sounds
and
colors
and
odors
and
sentiments
a
duplicate
source
of
delight
but
this
mere
repetition
is
not
poetry
he
who
shall
simply
sing
with
however
glowing
enthusiasm
or
with
however
vivid
a
truth
of
description
of
the
sights
and
sounds
and
odors
and
colors
and
sentiments
which
greet
him
in
common
with
all
mankind
he
i
say
has
yet
failed
to
prove
his
divine
title
there
is
still
a
something
in
the
distance
which
he
has
been
unable
to
attain
we
have
still
a
thirst
unquenchable
to
allay
which
he
has
not
shown
us
the
crystal
springs
this
thirst
belongs
to
the
immortality
of
man
it
is
at
once
a
consequence
and
an
indication
of
his
perennial
existence
it
is
the
desire
of
the
moth
for
the
star
it
is
no
mere
appreciation
of
the
beauty
before
us
but
a
wild
effort
to
reach
the
beauty
above
inspired
by
an
ecstatic
prescience
of
the
glories
beyond
the
grave
we
struggle
by
multiform
combinations
among
the
things
and
thoughts
of
time
to
attain
a
portion
of
that
loveliness
whose
very
elements
perhaps
appertain
to
eternity
alone
and
thus
when
by
poetry
or
when
by
music
the
most
entrancing
of
the
poetic
moods
we
find
ourselves
melted
into
tears
we
weep
then
not
as
the
abbate
gravina
supposes
through
excess
of
pleasure
but
through
a
certain
petulant
impatient
sorrow
at
our
inability
to
grasp
wholly
here
on
earth
at
once
and
forever
those
divine
and
rapturous
joys
of
which
the
poem
or
the
music
we
attain
to
but
brief
and
indeterminate
glimpses
the
struggle
to
apprehend
the
supernal
loveliness
this
struggle
on
the
part
of
souls
fittingly
constituted
has
given
to
the
world
all
which
it
the
world
has
ever
been
enabled
at
once
to
understand
and
as
poetic
the
poetic
sentiment
of
course
may
develop
itself
in
various
modes
in
painting
in
sculpture
in
architecture
in
the
dance
very
especially
in
music
and
very
peculiarly
and
with
a
wide
field
in
the
composition
of
the
landscape
garden
our
present
theme
however
has
regard
only
to
its
manifestation
in
words
and
here
let
me
speak
briefly
on
the
topic
of
rhythm
contenting
myself
with
the
certainty
that
music
in
its
various
modes
of
metre
rhythm
and
rhyme
is
of
so
vast
a
moment
in
poetry
as
never
to
be
wisely
rejected
is
so
vitally
important
an
adjunct
that
he
is
simply
silly
who
declines
its
assistance
i
will
not
now
pause
to
maintain
its
absolute
essentiality
it
is
in
music
perhaps
that
the
soul
most
nearly
attains
the
great
end
for
which
when
inspired
by
the
poetic
sentiment
it
struggles
the
creation
of
supernal
beauty
it
be
indeed
that
here
this
sublime
end
is
now
and
then
attained
in
we
are
often
made
to
feel
with
a
shivering
delight
that
from
an
earthly
harp
are
stricken
notes
which
have
been
unfamiliar
to
the
angels
and
thus
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
in
the
union
of
poetry
with
music
in
its
popular
sense
we
shall
find
the
widest
field
for
the
poetic
development
the
old
bards
and
minnesingers
had
advantages
which
we
do
not
possess
and
thomas
moore
singing
his
own
songs
was
in
the
most
legitimate
manner
perfecting
them
as
poems
to
recapitulate
then
i
would
define
in
brief
the
poetry
of
words
as
rhythmical
creation
of
its
sole
arbiter
is
taste
with
the
intellect
or
with
the
conscience
it
has
only
collateral
relations
unless
incidentally
it
has
no
concern
whatever
either
with
duty
or
with
truth
a
few
words
however
in
explanation
pleasure
which
is
at
once
the
most
pure
the
most
elevating
and
the
most
intense
is
derived
i
maintain
from
the
contemplation
of
the
beautiful
in
the
contemplation
of
beauty
we
alone
find
it
possible
to
attain
that
pleasurable
elevation
or
excitement
the
which
we
recognize
as
the
poetic
sentiment
and
which
is
so
easily
distinguished
from
truth
which
is
the
satisfaction
of
the
reason
or
from
passion
which
is
the
excitement
of
the
heart
i
make
beauty
therefore
using
the
word
as
inclusive
of
the
sublime
i
make
beauty
the
province
of
the
poem
simply
because
it
is
an
obvious
rule
of
art
that
effects
should
be
made
to
spring
as
directly
as
possible
from
their
causes
no
one
as
yet
having
been
weak
enough
to
deny
that
the
peculiar
elevation
in
question
is
at
least
attainable
in
the
poem
it
by
no
means
follows
however
that
the
incitements
of
passion
or
the
precepts
of
duty
or
even
the
lessons
of
truth
may
not
be
introduced
into
a
poem
and
with
advantage
for
they
may
subserve
incidentally
in
various
ways
the
general
purposes
of
the
work
but
the
true
artist
will
always
contrive
to
tone
them
down
in
proper
subjection
to
that
beauty
which
is
the
atmosphere
and
the
real
essence
of
the
poem
i
can
not
better
introduce
the
few
poems
which
i
shall
present
for
your
consideration
than
by
the
citation
of
the
pröem
to
longfellow
waif
the
day
is
done
and
the
darkness
falls
from
the
wings
of
night
as
a
feather
is
wafted
downward
from
an
eagle
in
his
flight
i
see
the
lights
of
the
village
gleam
through
the
rain
and
the
mist
and
a
feeling
of
sadness
comes
me
that
my
soul
can
not
resist
a
feeling
of
sadness
and
longing
that
is
not
akin
to
pain
and
resembles
sorrow
only
as
the
mist
resembles
the
rain
come
read
to
me
some
poem
some
simple
and
heartfelt
lay
that
shall
soothe
this
restless
feeling
and
banish
the
thoughts
of
day
not
from
the
grand
old
masters
not
from
the
bards
sublime
whose
distant
footsteps
echo
through
the
corridors
of
time
for
like
strains
of
martial
music
their
mighty
thoughts
suggest
life
endless
toil
and
endeavor
and
i
long
for
rest
read
from
some
humbler
poet
whose
songs
gushed
from
his
heart
as
showers
from
the
clouds
of
summer
or
tears
from
the
eyelids
start
who
through
long
days
of
labor
and
nights
devoid
of
ease
still
heard
in
his
soul
the
music
of
wonderful
melodies
such
songs
have
power
to
quiet
the
restless
pulse
of
care
and
come
like
the
benediction
that
follows
after
prayer
then
read
from
the
treasured
volume
the
poem
of
thy
choice
and
lend
to
the
rhyme
of
the
poet
the
beauty
of
thy
voice
and
the
night
shall
be
filled
with
music
and
the
cares
that
infest
the
day
shall
fold
their
tents
like
the
arabs
and
as
silently
steal
away
with
no
great
range
of
imagination
these
lines
have
been
justly
admired
for
their
delicacy
of
expression
some
of
the
images
are
very
effective
nothing
can
be
better
than
the
bards
sublime
whose
distant
footsteps
echo
down
the
corridors
of
time
the
idea
of
the
last
quatrain
is
also
very
effective
the
poem
on
the
whole
however
is
chiefly
to
be
admired
for
the
graceful
of
its
metre
so
well
in
accordance
with
the
character
of
the
sentiments
and
especially
for
the
of
the
general
manner
this
ease
or
naturalness
in
a
literary
style
it
has
long
been
the
fashion
to
regard
as
ease
in
appearance
alone
as
a
point
of
really
difficult
attainment
but
not
so
a
natural
manner
is
difficult
only
to
him
who
should
never
meddle
with
it
to
the
unnatural
it
is
but
the
result
of
writing
with
the
understanding
or
with
the
instinct
that
in
composition
should
always
be
that
which
the
mass
of
mankind
would
adopt
and
must
perpetually
vary
of
course
with
the
occasion
the
author
who
after
the
fashion
of
north
american
should
be
upon
occasions
merely
quiet
must
necessarily
upon
occasions
be
simply
silly
or
stupid
and
has
no
more
right
to
be
considered
easy
or
natural
than
a
cockney
exquisite
or
than
the
sleeping
beauty
in
the
waxworks
among
the
minor
poems
of
bryant
none
has
so
much
impressed
me
as
the
one
which
he
entitles
june
i
quote
only
a
portion
of
it
there
through
the
long
long
summer
hours
the
golden
light
should
lie
and
thick
young
herbs
and
groups
of
flowers
stand
in
their
beauty
by
the
oriole
should
build
and
tell
his
close
beside
my
cell
the
idle
butterfly
should
rest
him
there
and
there
be
heard
the
and
humming
bird
and
what
if
cheerful
shouts
at
noon
come
from
the
village
sent
or
songs
of
maids
beneath
the
moon
with
fairy
laughter
blent
and
what
if
in
the
evening
light
betrothed
lovers
walk
in
sight
of
my
low
monument
i
would
the
lovely
scene
around
might
know
no
sadder
sight
nor
sound
i
know
i
know
i
should
not
see
the
season
glorious
show
nor
would
its
brightness
shine
for
me
nor
its
wild
music
flow
but
if
around
my
place
of
sleep
the
friends
i
love
should
come
to
weep
they
might
not
haste
to
go
soft
airs
and
song
and
light
and
bloom
should
keep
them
lingering
by
my
tomb
these
to
their
soften
hearts
should
bear
the
thought
of
what
has
been
and
speak
of
one
who
can
not
share
the
gladness
of
the
scene
whose
part
in
all
the
pomp
that
fills
the
circuit
of
the
summer
hills
is
that
his
grave
is
green
and
deeply
would
their
hearts
rejoice
to
hear
again
his
living
voice
the
rhythmical
flow
here
is
even
voluptuous
nothing
could
be
more
melodious
the
poem
has
always
affected
me
in
a
remarkable
manner
the
intense
melancholy
which
seems
to
well
up
perforce
to
the
surface
of
all
the
poet
cheerful
sayings
about
his
grave
we
find
thrilling
us
to
the
soul
while
there
is
the
truest
poetic
elevation
in
the
thrill
the
impression
left
is
one
of
a
pleasurable
sadness
and
if
in
the
remaining
compositions
which
i
shall
introduce
to
you
there
be
more
or
less
of
a
similar
tone
always
apparent
let
me
remind
you
that
how
or
why
we
know
not
this
certain
taint
of
sadness
is
inseparably
connected
with
all
the
higher
manifestations
of
true
beauty
it
is
nevertheless
a
feeling
of
sadness
and
longing
that
is
not
akin
to
pain
and
resembles
sorrow
only
as
the
mist
resembles
the
rain
the
taint
of
which
i
speak
is
clearly
perceptible
even
in
a
poem
so
full
of
brilliancy
and
spirit
as
the
health
of
edward
coote
pinkney
i
fill
this
cup
to
one
made
up
of
loveliness
alone
a
woman
of
her
gentle
sex
the
seeming
paragon
to
whom
the
better
elements
and
kindly
stars
have
given
a
form
so
fair
that
like
the
air
is
less
of
earth
than
heaven
her
every
tone
is
music
own
like
those
of
morning
birds
and
something
more
than
melody
dwells
ever
in
her
words
the
coinage
of
her
heart
are
they
and
from
her
lips
each
flows
as
one
may
see
the
burden
bee
forth
issue
from
the
rose
affections
are
as
thoughts
to
her
the
measures
of
her
hours
her
feelings
have
the
fragrancy
the
freshness
of
young
flowers
and
lovely
passions
changing
oft
so
fill
her
she
appears
the
image
of
themselves
by
turns
the
idol
of
past
years
of
her
bright
face
one
glance
will
trace
a
picture
on
the
brain
and
of
her
voice
in
echoing
hearts
a
sound
must
long
remain
but
memory
such
as
mine
of
her
so
very
much
endears
when
death
is
nigh
my
latest
sigh
will
not
be
life
but
hers
i
fill
this
cup
to
one
made
up
of
loveliness
alone
a
woman
of
her
gentle
sex
the
seeming
paragon
her
health
and
would
on
earth
there
stood
some
more
of
such
a
frame
that
life
might
be
all
poetry
and
weariness
a
name
it
was
the
misfortune
of
pinkney
to
have
been
born
too
far
south
had
he
been
a
new
englander
it
is
probable
that
he
would
have
been
ranked
as
the
first
of
american
lyrists
by
that
magnanimous
cabal
which
has
so
long
controlled
the
destinies
of
american
letters
in
conducting
the
thing
called
north
american
review
the
poem
just
cited
is
especially
beautiful
but
the
poetic
elevation
which
it
induces
we
must
refer
chiefly
to
our
sympathy
in
the
poet
enthusiasm
we
pardon
his
hyperboles
for
the
evident
earnestness
with
which
they
are
uttered
it
was
by
no
means
my
design
however
to
expatiate
upon
the
of
what
i
should
read
you
these
will
necessarily
speak
for
themselves
boccalina
in
his
from
parnassus
tells
us
that
zoilus
once
presented
apollo
a
very
caustic
criticism
upon
a
very
admirable
book
whereupon
the
god
asked
him
for
the
beauties
of
the
work
he
replied
that
he
only
busied
himself
about
the
errors
on
hearing
this
apollo
handing
him
a
sack
of
unwinnowed
wheat
bade
him
pick
out
the
for
his
reward
now
this
fable
answers
very
well
as
a
hit
at
the
critics
but
i
am
by
no
means
sure
that
the
god
was
in
the
right
i
am
by
no
means
certain
that
the
true
limits
of
the
critical
duty
are
not
grossly
misunderstood
excellence
in
a
poem
especially
may
be
considered
in
the
light
of
an
axiom
which
need
only
be
properly
to
become
it
is
excellence
if
it
require
to
be
demonstrated
its
such
and
thus
to
point
out
too
particularly
the
merits
of
a
work
of
art
is
to
admit
that
they
are
merits
altogether
among
the
melodies
of
thomas
moore
is
one
whose
distinguished
character
as
a
poem
proper
seems
to
have
been
singularly
left
out
of
view
i
allude
to
his
lines
beginning
come
rest
in
this
bosom
the
intense
energy
of
their
expression
is
not
surpassed
by
anything
in
byron
there
are
two
of
the
lines
in
which
a
sentiment
is
conveyed
that
embodies
the
in
of
the
divine
passion
of
love
a
sentiment
which
perhaps
has
found
its
echo
in
more
and
in
more
passionate
human
hearts
that
any
other
single
sentiment
ever
embodied
in
words
come
rest
in
this
bosom
my
own
stricken
deer
though
the
herd
have
fled
from
thee
thy
home
is
still
here
here
still
is
the
smile
that
no
cloud
can
and
a
heart
and
a
hand
all
thy
own
to
the
last
oh
what
was
love
made
for
if
is
not
the
same
through
joy
and
through
torment
through
glory
and
shame
i
know
not
i
ask
not
if
guilt
in
that
heart
i
but
know
that
i
love
thee
whatever
thou
art
thou
hast
call
me
thy
angel
in
moments
of
bliss
and
thy
angel
i
be
the
horrors
of
this
through
the
furnace
unshrinking
thy
steps
to
pursue
and
shield
thee
and
save
thee
or
perish
there
too
it
has
been
the
fashion
of
late
days
to
deny
moore
imagination
while
granting
him
fancy
a
distinction
originating
with
coleridge
than
whom
no
man
more
fully
comprehended
the
great
powers
of
moore
the
fact
is
that
the
fancy
of
this
poet
so
far
predominates
over
all
his
other
faculties
and
over
the
fancy
of
all
other
men
as
to
have
induced
very
naturally
the
idea
that
he
is
fanciful
but
never
was
there
a
greater
mistake
never
was
a
grosser
wrong
done
the
fame
of
a
true
poet
in
the
compass
of
the
english
language
i
can
call
to
mind
no
poem
more
profoundly
more
weirdly
in
the
best
sense
than
the
lines
commencing
i
would
i
were
by
that
dim
lake
which
are
the
composition
of
thomas
moore
i
regret
that
i
am
unable
to
remember
them
one
of
the
noblest
and
speaking
of
fancy
one
of
the
most
singularly
fanciful
of
modern
poets
was
thomas
hood
his
fair
ines
had
always
for
me
an
inexpressible
charm
o
saw
ye
not
fair
ines
she
gone
into
the
west
to
dazzle
when
the
sun
is
down
and
rob
the
world
of
rest
she
took
our
daylight
with
her
the
smiles
that
we
love
best
with
morning
blushes
on
her
cheek
and
pearls
upon
her
breast
o
turn
again
fair
ines
before
the
fall
of
night
for
fear
the
moon
should
shine
alone
and
stars
unrivall
bright
and
blessed
will
the
lover
be
that
walks
beneath
their
light
and
breathes
the
love
against
thy
cheek
i
dare
not
even
write
would
i
had
been
fair
ines
that
gallant
cavalier
who
rode
so
gaily
by
thy
side
and
whisper
thee
so
near
were
there
no
bonny
dames
at
home
or
no
true
lovers
here
that
he
should
cross
the
seas
to
win
the
dearest
of
the
dear
i
saw
thee
lovely
ines
descend
along
the
shore
with
bands
of
noble
gentlemen
and
before
and
gentle
youth
and
maidens
gay
and
snowy
plumes
they
wore
it
would
have
been
a
beauteous
dream
if
it
had
been
no
more
alas
alas
fair
ines
she
went
away
with
song
with
music
waiting
on
her
steps
and
shoutings
of
the
throng
but
some
were
sad
and
felt
no
mirth
but
only
music
wrong
in
sounds
that
sang
farewell
farewell
to
her
you
loved
so
long
farewell
farewell
fair
ines
that
vessel
never
bore
so
fair
a
lady
on
its
deck
nor
danced
so
light
before
alas
for
pleasure
on
the
sea
and
sorrow
on
the
shore
the
smile
that
blest
one
lover
heart
has
broken
many
more
the
haunted
house
by
the
same
author
is
one
of
the
truest
poems
ever
written
one
of
the
truest
one
of
the
most
unexceptionable
one
of
the
most
thoroughly
artistic
both
in
its
theme
and
in
its
execution
it
is
moreover
powerfully
ideal
imaginative
i
regret
that
its
length
renders
it
unsuitable
for
the
purposes
of
this
lecture
in
place
of
it
permit
me
to
offer
the
universally
appreciated
bridge
of
sighs
one
more
unfortunate
weary
of
breath
rashly
importunate
gone
to
her
death
take
her
up
tenderly
lift
her
with
care
fashion
so
slenderly
young
and
so
fair
look
at
her
garments
clinging
like
cerements
whilst
the
wave
constantly
drips
from
her
clothing
take
her
up
instantly
loving
not
loathing
touch
her
not
scornfully
think
of
her
mournfully
gently
and
humanly
not
of
the
stains
of
her
all
that
remains
of
her
now
is
pure
womanly
make
no
deep
scrutiny
into
her
mutiny
rash
and
undutiful
past
all
dishonor
death
has
left
on
her
only
the
beautiful
where
the
lamps
quiver
so
far
in
the
river
with
many
a
light
from
window
and
casement
from
garret
to
basement
she
stood
with
amazement
houseless
by
night
the
bleak
wind
of
march
made
her
tremble
and
shiver
but
not
the
dark
arch
or
the
black
flowing
river
mad
from
life
history
glad
to
death
mystery
swift
to
be
hurl
anywhere
anywhere
out
of
the
world
in
she
plunged
boldly
no
matter
how
coldly
the
rough
river
ran
over
the
brink
of
it
picture
it
think
of
it
dissolute
man
lave
in
it
drink
of
it
then
if
you
can
still
for
all
slips
of
hers
one
of
eve
family
wipe
those
poor
lips
of
hers
oozing
so
clammily
loop
up
her
tresses
escaped
from
the
comb
her
fair
auburn
tresses
whilst
wonderment
guesses
where
was
her
home
who
was
her
father
who
was
her
mother
had
she
a
sister
had
she
a
brother
or
was
there
a
dearer
one
still
and
a
nearer
one
yet
than
all
other
alas
for
the
rarity
of
christian
charity
under
the
sun
oh
it
was
pitiful
near
a
whole
city
full
home
she
had
none
sisterly
brotherly
fatherly
motherly
feelings
had
changed
love
by
harsh
evidence
thrown
from
its
eminence
even
god
providence
seeming
estranged
take
her
up
tenderly
lift
her
with
care
fashion
so
slenderly
young
and
so
fair
ere
her
limbs
frigidly
stiffen
too
rigidly
decently
kindly
smooth
and
compose
them
and
her
eyes
close
them
staring
so
blindly
dreadfully
staring
through
muddy
impurity
as
when
with
the
daring
last
look
of
despairing
fixed
on
futurity
perishing
gloomily
spurred
by
contumely
cold
inhumanity
burning
insanity
into
her
rest
cross
her
hands
humbly
as
if
praying
dumbly
over
her
breast
owning
her
weakness
her
evil
behavior
and
leaving
with
meekness
her
sins
to
her
saviour
the
vigor
of
this
poem
is
no
less
remarkable
than
its
pathos
the
versification
although
carrying
the
fanciful
to
the
very
verge
of
the
fantastic
is
nevertheless
admirably
adapted
to
the
wild
insanity
which
is
the
thesis
of
the
poem
among
the
minor
poems
of
lord
byron
is
one
which
has
never
received
from
the
critics
the
praise
which
it
undoubtedly
deserves
though
the
day
of
my
destiny
over
and
the
star
of
my
fate
hath
declined
thy
soft
heart
refused
to
discover
the
faults
which
so
many
could
find
though
thy
soul
with
my
grief
was
acquainted
it
shrunk
not
to
share
it
with
me
and
the
love
which
my
spirit
hath
painted
it
never
hath
found
but
in
then
when
nature
around
me
is
smiling
the
last
smile
which
answers
to
mine
i
do
not
believe
it
beguiling
because
it
reminds
me
of
thine
and
when
winds
are
at
war
with
the
ocean
as
the
breasts
i
believed
in
with
me
if
their
billows
excite
an
emotion
it
is
that
they
bear
me
from
though
the
rock
of
my
last
hope
is
shivered
and
its
fragments
are
sunk
in
the
wave
though
i
feel
that
my
soul
is
delivered
to
pain
it
shall
not
be
its
slave
there
is
many
a
pang
to
pursue
me
they
may
crush
but
they
shall
not
contemn
they
may
torture
but
shall
not
subdue
me
is
of
that
i
think
not
of
them
though
human
thou
didst
not
deceive
me
though
woman
thou
didst
not
forsake
though
loved
thou
forborest
to
grieve
me
though
slandered
thou
never
couldst
shake
though
trusted
thou
didst
not
disclaim
me
though
parted
it
was
not
to
fly
though
watchful
was
not
to
defame
me
nor
mute
that
the
world
might
belie
yet
i
blame
not
the
world
nor
despise
it
nor
the
war
of
the
many
with
one
if
my
soul
was
not
fitted
to
prize
it
was
folly
not
sooner
to
shun
and
if
dearly
that
error
hath
cost
me
and
more
than
i
once
could
foresee
i
have
found
that
whatever
it
lost
me
it
could
not
deprive
me
of
from
the
wreck
of
the
past
which
hath
perished
thus
much
i
at
least
may
recall
it
hath
taught
me
that
which
i
most
cherished
deserved
to
be
dearest
of
all
in
the
desert
a
fountain
is
springing
in
the
wide
waste
there
still
is
a
tree
and
a
bird
in
the
solitude
singing
which
speaks
to
my
spirit
of
although
the
rhythm
here
is
one
of
the
most
difficult
the
versification
could
scarcely
be
improved
no
nobler
theme
ever
engaged
the
pen
of
poet
it
is
the
idea
that
no
man
can
consider
himself
entitled
to
complain
of
fate
while
in
his
adversity
he
still
retains
the
unwavering
love
of
woman
from
alfred
tennyson
although
in
perfect
sincerity
i
regard
him
as
the
noblest
poet
that
ever
lived
i
have
left
myself
time
to
cite
only
a
very
brief
specimen
i
call
him
and
him
the
noblest
of
poets
because
the
impressions
he
produces
are
at
times
the
most
profound
because
the
poetical
excitement
which
he
induces
is
at
times
the
most
intense
but
because
it
is
at
all
times
the
most
ethereal
in
other
words
the
most
elevating
and
most
pure
no
poet
is
so
little
of
the
earth
earthy
what
i
am
about
to
read
is
from
his
last
long
poem
the
princess
tears
idle
tears
i
know
not
what
they
mean
tears
from
the
depth
of
some
divine
despair
rise
in
the
heart
and
gather
to
the
eyes
in
looking
on
the
happy
autumn
fields
and
thinking
of
the
days
that
are
no
more
fresh
as
the
first
beam
glittering
on
a
sail
that
brings
our
friends
up
from
the
underworld
sad
as
the
last
which
reddens
over
one
that
sinks
with
all
we
love
below
the
verge
so
sad
so
fresh
the
days
that
are
no
more
ah
sad
and
strange
as
in
dark
summer
dawns
the
earliest
pipe
of
birds
to
dying
ears
when
unto
dying
eyes
the
casement
slowly
grows
a
glimmering
square
so
sad
so
strange
the
days
that
are
no
more
dear
as
remember
kisses
after
death
and
sweet
as
those
by
hopeless
fancy
on
lips
that
are
for
others
deep
as
love
deep
as
first
love
and
wild
with
all
regret
o
death
in
life
the
days
that
are
no
more
thus
although
in
a
very
cursory
and
imperfect
manner
i
have
endeavored
to
convey
to
you
my
conception
of
the
poetic
principle
it
has
been
my
purpose
to
suggest
that
while
this
principle
itself
is
strictly
and
simply
the
human
aspiration
for
supernal
beauty
the
manifestation
of
the
principle
is
always
found
in
elevating
excitement
of
the
quite
independent
of
that
passion
which
is
the
intoxication
of
the
heart
or
of
that
truth
which
is
the
satisfaction
of
the
reason
for
in
regard
to
passion
alas
its
tendency
is
to
degrade
rather
than
to
elevate
the
soul
love
on
the
contrary
love
the
true
the
divine
eros
the
uranian
as
distinguished
from
the
dionasan
venus
is
unquestionably
the
purest
and
truest
of
all
poetical
themes
and
in
regard
to
truth
if
to
be
sure
through
the
attainment
of
a
truth
we
are
led
to
perceive
a
harmony
where
none
was
apparent
before
we
experience
at
once
the
true
poetical
effect
but
this
effect
is
referable
to
the
harmony
alone
and
not
in
the
least
degree
to
the
truth
which
merely
served
to
render
the
harmony
manifest
we
shall
reach
however
more
immediately
a
distinct
conception
of
what
true
poetry
is
by
mere
reference
to
a
few
of
the
simple
elements
which
induce
in
the
poet
himself
the
true
poetical
effect
he
recognizes
the
ambrosia
which
nourishes
his
soul
in
the
bright
orbs
that
shine
in
heaven
in
the
volutes
of
the
flower
in
the
clustering
of
low
shrubberies
in
the
waving
of
the
in
the
slanting
of
tall
eastern
trees
in
the
blue
distance
of
mountains
in
the
grouping
of
clouds
in
the
twinkling
of
brooks
in
the
gleaming
of
silver
rivers
in
the
repose
of
sequestered
lakes
in
the
depths
of
lonely
wells
he
perceives
it
in
the
songs
of
birds
in
the
harp
of
æolus
in
the
sighing
of
the
in
the
repining
voice
of
the
forest
in
the
surf
that
complains
to
the
shore
in
the
fresh
breath
of
the
woods
in
the
scent
of
the
violet
in
the
voluptuous
perfume
of
the
hyacinth
in
the
suggestive
odor
that
comes
to
him
at
eventide
from
undiscovered
islands
over
dim
oceans
illimitable
and
unexplored
he
owns
it
in
all
noble
thoughts
in
all
unworldly
motives
in
all
holy
impulses
in
all
chivalrous
generous
and
deeds
he
feels
it
in
the
beauty
of
woman
in
the
grace
of
her
step
in
the
lustre
of
her
eye
in
the
melody
of
her
voice
in
her
soft
laughter
in
her
sigh
in
the
harmony
of
the
rustling
of
her
robes
he
deeply
feels
it
in
her
winning
endearments
in
her
burning
enthusiasms
in
her
gentle
charities
in
her
meek
and
devotional
endurance
but
above
all
ah
far
above
all
he
kneels
to
it
he
worships
it
in
the
faith
in
the
purity
in
the
strength
in
the
altogether
divine
majesty
of
her
let
me
conclude
by
the
recitation
of
yet
another
brief
poem
one
very
different
in
character
from
any
that
i
have
before
quoted
it
is
by
motherwell
and
is
called
the
song
of
the
cavalier
with
our
modern
and
altogether
rational
ideas
of
the
absurdity
and
impiety
of
warfare
we
are
not
precisely
in
that
frame
of
mind
best
adapted
to
sympathize
with
the
sentiments
and
thus
to
appreciate
the
real
excellence
of
the
poem
to
do
this
fully
we
must
identify
ourselves
in
fancy
with
the
soul
of
the
old
cavalier
a
steed
a
steed
of
matchless
speede
a
sword
of
metal
keene

else

heartes

oh

of

is

to

the
philosophy
of
composition
charles
dickens
in
a
note
now
lying
before
me
alluding
to
an
examination
i
once
made
of
the
mechanism
of
says
by
the
way
are
you
aware
that
godwin
wrote
his
backwards
he
first
involved
his
hero
in
a
web
of
difficulties
forming
the
second
volume
and
then
for
the
first
cast
about
him
for
some
mode
of
accounting
for
what
had
been
done
i
can
not
think
this
the
mode
of
procedure
on
the
part
of
godwin
and
indeed
what
he
himself
acknowledges
is
not
altogether
in
accordance
with
dickens
idea
but
the
author
of
was
too
good
an
artist
not
to
perceive
the
advantage
derivable
from
at
least
a
somewhat
similar
process
nothing
is
more
clear
than
that
every
plot
worth
the
name
must
be
elaborated
to
its
before
anything
be
attempted
with
the
pen
it
is
only
with
the
constantly
in
view
that
we
can
give
a
plot
its
indispensable
air
of
consequence
or
causation
by
making
the
incidents
and
especially
the
tone
at
all
points
tend
to
the
development
of
the
intention
there
is
a
radical
error
i
think
in
the
usual
mode
of
constructing
a
story
either
history
affords
a
thesis
or
one
is
suggested
by
an
incident
of
the
day
or
at
best
the
author
sets
himself
to
work
in
the
combination
of
striking
events
to
form
merely
the
basis
of
his
narrative
generally
to
fill
in
with
description
dialogue
or
autorial
comment
whatever
crevices
of
fact
or
action
may
from
page
to
page
render
themselves
apparent
i
prefer
commencing
with
the
consideration
of
an
keeping
originality
in
view
for
he
is
false
to
himself
who
ventures
to
dispense
with
so
obvious
and
so
easily
attainable
a
source
of
interest
i
say
to
myself
in
the
first
place
of
the
innumerable
effects
or
impressions
of
which
the
heart
the
intellect
or
more
generally
the
soul
is
susceptible
what
one
shall
i
on
the
present
occasion
select
having
chosen
a
novel
first
and
secondly
a
vivid
effect
i
consider
whether
it
can
be
best
wrought
by
incident
or
tone
whether
by
ordinary
incidents
and
peculiar
tone
or
the
converse
or
by
peculiarity
both
of
incident
and
tone
afterwards
looking
about
me
or
rather
within
for
such
combinations
of
events
or
tone
as
shall
best
aid
me
in
the
construction
of
the
effect
i
have
often
thought
how
interesting
a
magazine
paper
might
be
written
by
any
author
who
would
that
is
to
say
who
could
detail
step
by
step
the
processes
by
which
any
one
of
his
compositions
attained
its
ultimate
point
of
completion
why
such
a
paper
has
never
been
given
to
the
world
i
am
much
at
a
loss
to
say
but
perhaps
the
autorial
vanity
has
had
more
to
do
with
the
omission
than
any
one
other
cause
most
writers
poets
in
especial
prefer
having
it
understood
that
they
compose
by
a
species
of
fine
frenzy
an
ecstatic
intuition
and
would
positively
shudder
at
letting
the
public
take
a
peep
behind
the
scenes
at
the
elaborate
and
vacillating
crudities
of
thought
at
the
true
purposes
seized
only
at
the
last
moment
at
the
innumerable
glimpses
of
idea
that
arrived
not
at
the
maturity
of
full
view
at
the
fancies
discarded
in
despair
as
unmanageable
at
the
cautious
selections
and
rejections
at
the
painful
erasures
and
interpolations
in
a
word
at
the
wheels
and
pinions
the
tackle
for
the
and
the
cock
feathers
the
red
paint
and
the
black
patches
which
in
cases
out
of
the
hundred
constitute
the
properties
of
the
literary
i
am
aware
on
the
other
hand
that
the
case
is
by
no
means
common
in
which
an
author
is
at
all
in
condition
to
retrace
the
steps
by
which
his
conclusions
have
been
attained
in
general
suggestions
having
arisen
are
pursued
and
forgotten
in
a
similar
manner
for
my
own
part
i
have
neither
sympathy
with
the
repugnance
alluded
to
nor
at
any
time
the
least
difficulty
in
recalling
to
mind
the
progressive
steps
of
any
of
my
compositions
and
since
the
interest
of
an
analysis
or
reconstruction
such
as
i
have
considered
a
is
quite
independent
of
any
real
or
fancied
interest
in
the
thing
analyzed
it
will
not
be
regarded
as
a
breach
of
decorum
on
my
part
to
show
the
by
which
some
one
of
my
own
works
was
put
together
i
select
the
raven
as
most
generally
known
it
is
my
design
to
render
it
manifest
that
no
one
point
in
its
composition
is
referrible
either
to
accident
or
intuition
that
the
work
proceeded
step
by
step
to
its
completion
with
the
precision
and
rigid
consequence
of
a
mathematical
problem
let
us
dismiss
as
irrelevant
to
the
poem
the
circumstance
or
say
the
necessity
which
in
the
first
place
gave
rise
to
the
intention
of
composing
poem
that
should
suit
at
once
the
popular
and
the
critical
taste
we
commence
then
with
this
intention
the
initial
consideration
was
that
of
extent
if
any
literary
work
is
too
long
to
be
read
at
one
sitting
we
must
be
content
to
dispense
with
the
immensely
important
effect
derivable
from
unity
of
impression
for
if
two
sittings
be
required
the
affairs
of
the
world
interfere
and
everything
like
totality
is
at
once
destroyed
but
since
no
poet
can
afford
to
dispense
with
that
may
advance
his
design
it
but
remains
to
be
seen
whether
there
is
in
extent
any
advantage
to
counterbalance
the
loss
of
unity
which
attends
it
here
i
say
no
at
once
what
we
term
a
long
poem
is
in
fact
merely
a
succession
of
brief
ones
that
is
to
say
of
brief
poetical
effects
it
is
needless
to
demonstrate
that
a
poem
is
such
only
inasmuch
as
it
intensely
excites
by
elevating
the
soul
and
all
intense
excitements
are
through
a
psychal
necessity
brief
for
this
reason
at
least
of
the
paradise
lost
is
essentially
prose
a
succession
of
poetical
excitements
interspersed
with
corresponding
depressions
the
whole
being
deprived
through
the
extremeness
of
its
length
of
the
vastly
important
artistic
element
totality
or
unity
of
effect
it
appears
evident
then
that
there
is
a
distinct
limit
as
regards
length
to
all
works
of
literary
art
the
limit
of
a
single
sitting
and
that
although
in
certain
classes
of
prose
composition
such
as
demanding
no
unity
this
limit
may
be
advantageously
overpassed
it
can
never
properly
be
overpassed
in
a
poem
within
this
limit
the
extent
of
a
poem
may
be
made
to
bear
mathematical
relation
to
its
merit
in
other
words
to
the
excitement
or
elevation
again
in
other
words
to
the
degree
of
the
true
poetical
effect
which
it
is
capable
of
inducing
for
it
is
clear
that
the
brevity
must
be
in
direct
ratio
of
the
intensity
of
the
intended
effect
this
with
one
proviso
that
a
certain
degree
of
duration
is
absolutely
requisite
for
the
production
of
any
effect
at
all
holding
in
view
these
considerations
as
well
as
that
degree
of
excitement
which
i
deemed
not
above
the
popular
while
not
below
the
critical
taste
i
reached
at
once
what
i
conceived
the
proper
for
my
intended
poem
a
length
of
about
one
hundred
lines
it
is
in
fact
a
hundred
and
eight
my
next
thought
concerned
the
choice
of
an
impression
or
effect
to
be
conveyed
and
here
i
may
as
well
observe
that
throughout
the
construction
i
kept
steadily
in
view
the
design
of
rendering
the
work
appreciable
i
should
be
carried
too
far
out
of
my
immediate
topic
were
i
to
demonstrate
a
point
upon
which
i
have
repeatedly
insisted
and
which
with
the
poetical
stands
not
in
the
slightest
need
of
demonstration
the
point
i
mean
that
beauty
is
the
sole
legitimate
province
of
the
poem
a
few
words
however
in
elucidation
of
my
real
meaning
which
some
of
my
friends
have
evinced
a
disposition
to
misrepresent
that
pleasure
which
is
at
once
the
most
intense
the
most
elevating
and
the
most
pure
is
i
believe
found
in
the
contemplation
of
the
beautiful
when
indeed
men
speak
of
beauty
they
mean
precisely
not
a
quality
as
is
supposed
but
an
effect
they
refer
in
short
just
to
that
intense
and
pure
elevation
of
of
intellect
or
of
heart
upon
which
i
have
commented
and
which
is
experienced
in
consequence
of
contemplating
the
beautiful
now
i
designate
beauty
as
the
province
of
the
poem
merely
because
it
is
an
obvious
rule
of
art
that
effects
should
be
made
to
spring
from
direct
causes
that
objects
should
be
attained
through
means
best
adapted
for
their
attainment
no
one
as
yet
having
been
weak
enough
to
deny
that
the
peculiar
elevation
alluded
to
is
attained
in
the
poem
now
the
object
truth
or
the
satisfaction
of
the
intellect
and
the
object
passion
or
the
excitement
of
the
heart
are
although
attainable
to
a
certain
extent
in
poetry
far
more
readily
attainable
in
prose
truth
in
fact
demands
a
precision
and
passion
a
the
truly
passionate
will
comprehend
me
which
are
absolutely
antagonistic
to
that
beauty
which
i
maintain
is
the
excitement
or
pleasurable
elevation
of
the
soul
it
by
no
means
follows
from
anything
here
said
that
passion
or
even
truth
may
not
be
introduced
and
even
profitably
introduced
into
a
poem
for
they
may
serve
in
elucidation
or
aid
the
general
effect
as
do
discords
in
music
by
contrast
but
the
true
artist
will
always
contrive
first
to
tone
them
into
proper
subservience
to
the
predominant
aim
and
secondly
to
enveil
them
as
far
as
possible
in
that
beauty
which
is
the
atmosphere
and
the
essence
of
the
poem
regarding
then
beauty
as
my
province
my
next
question
referred
to
the
of
its
highest
manifestation
and
all
experience
has
shown
that
this
tone
is
one
of
beauty
of
whatever
kind
in
its
supreme
development
invariably
excites
the
sensitive
soul
to
tears
melancholy
is
thus
the
most
legitimate
of
all
the
poetical
tones
the
length
the
province
and
the
tone
being
thus
determined
i
betook
myself
to
ordinary
induction
with
the
view
of
obtaining
some
artistic
piquancy
which
might
serve
me
as
a
in
the
construction
of
the
poem
some
pivot
upon
which
the
whole
structure
might
turn
in
carefully
thinking
over
all
the
usual
artistic
effects
or
more
properly
in
the
theatrical
sense
i
did
not
fail
to
perceive
immediately
that
no
one
had
been
so
universally
employed
as
that
of
the
the
universality
of
its
employment
sufficed
to
assure
me
of
its
intrinsic
value
and
spared
me
the
necessity
of
submitting
it
to
analysis
i
considered
it
however
with
regard
to
its
susceptibility
of
improvement
and
soon
saw
it
to
be
in
a
primitive
condition
as
commonly
used
the
or
burden
not
only
is
limited
to
lyric
verse
but
depends
for
its
impression
upon
the
force
of
monotone
both
in
sound
and
thought
the
pleasure
is
deduced
solely
from
the
sense
of
identity
of
repetition
i
resolved
to
diversify
and
so
heighten
the
effect
by
adhering
in
general
to
the
monotone
of
sound
while
i
continually
varied
that
of
thought
that
is
to
say
i
determined
to
produce
continuously
novel
effects
by
the
variation
the
of
the
the
itself
remaining
for
the
most
part
unvaried
these
points
being
settled
i
next
bethought
me
of
the
of
my
since
its
application
was
to
be
repeatedly
varied
it
was
clear
that
the
itself
must
be
brief
for
there
would
have
been
an
insurmountable
difficulty
in
frequent
variations
of
application
in
any
sentence
of
length
in
proportion
to
the
brevity
of
the
sentence
would
of
course
be
the
facility
of
the
variation
this
led
me
at
once
to
a
single
word
as
the
best
the
question
now
arose
as
to
the
of
the
word
having
made
up
my
mind
to
a
the
division
of
the
poem
into
stanzas
was
of
course
a
corollary
the
forming
the
close
to
each
stanza
that
such
a
close
to
have
force
must
be
sonorous
and
susceptible
of
protracted
emphasis
admitted
no
doubt
and
these
considerations
inevitably
led
me
to
the
long
as
the
most
sonorous
vowel
in
connection
with
as
the
most
producible
consonant
the
sound
of
the
being
thus
determined
it
became
necessary
to
select
a
word
embodying
this
sound
and
at
the
same
time
in
the
fullest
possible
keeping
with
that
melancholy
which
i
had
predetermined
as
the
tone
of
the
poem
in
such
a
search
it
would
have
been
absolutely
impossible
to
overlook
the
word
nevermore
in
fact
it
was
the
very
first
which
presented
itself
the
next
was
a
pretext
for
the
continuous
use
of
the
one
word
nevermore
in
observing
the
difficulty
which
i
at
once
found
in
inventing
a
sufficiently
plausible
reason
for
its
continuous
repetition
i
did
not
fail
to
perceive
that
this
difficulty
arose
solely
from
the
that
the
word
was
to
be
so
continuously
or
monotonously
spoken
by
a
being
i
did
not
fail
to
perceive
in
short
that
the
difficulty
lay
in
the
reconciliation
of
this
monotony
with
the
exercise
of
reason
on
the
part
of
the
creature
repeating
the
word
here
then
immediately
arose
the
idea
of
a
creature
capable
of
speech
and
very
naturally
a
parrot
in
the
first
instance
suggested
itself
but
was
superseded
forthwith
by
a
raven
as
equally
capable
of
speech
and
infinitely
more
in
keeping
with
the
intended
i
had
now
gone
so
far
as
the
conception
of
a
raven
the
bird
of
monotonously
repeating
the
one
word
nevermore
at
the
conclusion
of
each
stanza
in
a
poem
of
melancholy
tone
and
in
length
about
one
hundred
lines
now
never
losing
sight
of
the
object
or
perfection
at
all
points
i
asked
myself
of
all
melancholy
topics
what
according
to
the
understanding
of
mankind
is
the
melancholy
death
was
the
obvious
reply
and
when
i
said
is
this
most
melancholy
of
topics
most
poetical
from
what
i
have
already
explained
at
some
length
the
answer
here
also
is
obvious
when
it
most
closely
allies
itself
to
the
death
then
of
a
beautiful
woman
is
unquestionably
the
most
poetical
topic
in
the
world
and
equally
is
it
beyond
doubt
that
the
lips
best
suited
for
such
topic
are
those
of
a
bereaved
lover
i
had
now
to
combine
the
two
ideas
of
a
lover
lamenting
his
deceased
mistress
and
a
raven
continuously
repeating
the
word
nevermore
i
had
to
combine
these
bearing
in
mind
my
design
of
varying
at
every
turn
the
of
the
word
repeated
but
the
only
intelligible
mode
of
such
combination
is
that
of
imagining
the
raven
employing
the
word
in
answer
to
the
queries
of
the
lover
and
here
it
was
that
i
saw
at
once
the
opportunity
afforded
for
the
effect
on
which
i
had
been
depending
that
is
to
say
the
effect
of
the
of
i
saw
that
i
could
make
the
first
query
propounded
by
the
lover
the
first
query
to
which
the
raven
should
reply
nevermore
that
i
could
make
this
first
query
a
commonplace
one
the
second
less
so
the
third
still
less
and
so
on
until
at
length
the
lover
startled
from
his
original
by
the
melancholy
character
of
the
word
itself
by
its
frequent
repetition
and
by
a
consideration
of
the
ominous
reputation
of
the
fowl
that
uttered
it
is
at
length
excited
to
superstition
and
wildly
propounds
queries
of
a
far
different
character
queries
whose
solution
he
has
passionately
at
heart
propounds
them
half
in
superstition
and
half
in
that
species
of
despair
which
delights
in
propounds
them
not
altogether
because
he
believes
in
the
prophetic
or
demoniac
character
of
the
bird
which
reason
assures
him
is
merely
repeating
a
lesson
learned
by
rote
but
because
he
experiences
a
frenzied
pleasure
in
so
modelling
his
questions
as
to
receive
from
the
nevermore
the
most
delicious
because
the
most
intolerable
of
sorrow
perceiving
the
opportunity
thus
afforded
me
or
more
strictly
thus
forced
upon
me
in
the
progress
of
the
construction
i
first
established
in
mind
the
climax
or
concluding
query
that
query
to
which
nevermore
should
be
in
the
last
place
an
answer
that
query
in
reply
to
which
this
word
nevermore
should
involve
the
utmost
conceivable
amount
of
sorrow
and
despair
here
then
the
poem
may
be
said
to
have
its
beginning
at
the
end
where
all
works
of
art
should
begin
for
it
was
here
at
this
point
of
my
preconsiderations
that
i
first
put
pen
to
paper
in
the
composition
of
the
stanza
prophet
said
i
thing
of
evil
prophet
still
if
bird
or
devil
by
that
heaven
that
bends
above
us
by
that
god
we
both
adore
tell
this
soul
with
sorrow
laden
if
within
the
distant
aidenn
it
shall
clasp
a
sainted
maiden
whom
the
angels
name
lenore
clasp
a
rare
and
radiant
maiden
whom
the
angels
name
lenore
quoth
the
raven
nevermore
i
composed
this
stanza
at
this
point
first
that
by
establishing
the
climax
i
might
the
better
vary
and
graduate
as
regards
seriousness
and
importance
the
preceding
queries
of
the
lover
and
secondly
that
i
might
definitely
settle
the
rhythm
the
metre
and
the
length
and
general
arrangement
of
the
stanza
as
well
as
graduate
the
stanzas
which
were
to
precede
so
that
none
of
them
might
surpass
this
in
rhythmical
effect
had
i
been
able
in
the
subsequent
composition
to
construct
more
vigorous
stanzas
i
should
without
scruple
have
purposely
enfeebled
them
so
as
not
to
interfere
with
the
climacteric
effect
and
here
i
may
as
well
say
a
few
words
of
the
versification
my
first
object
as
usual
was
originality
the
extent
to
which
this
has
been
neglected
in
versification
is
one
of
the
most
unaccountable
things
in
the
world
admitting
that
there
is
little
possibility
of
variety
in
mere
it
is
still
clear
that
the
possible
varieties
of
metre
and
stanza
are
absolutely
infinite
and
yet
for
no
man
in
verse
has
ever
done
or
ever
seemed
to
think
of
doing
an
original
the
fact
is
that
originality
unless
in
minds
of
very
unusual
force
is
by
no
means
a
matter
as
some
suppose
of
impulse
or
intuition
in
general
to
be
found
it
must
be
elaborately
sought
and
although
a
positive
merit
of
the
highest
class
demands
in
its
attainment
less
of
invention
than
negation
of
course
i
pretend
to
no
originality
in
either
the
rhythm
or
metre
of
the
raven
the
former
is
trochaic
the
latter
is
octametre
acatalectic
alternating
with
heptametre
catalectic
repeated
in
the
of
the
fifth
verse
and
terminating
with
tetrametre
catalectic
less
pedantically
the
feet
employed
throughout
trochees
consists
of
a
long
syllable
followed
by
a
short
the
first
line
of
the
stanza
consists
of
eight
of
these
feet
the
second
of
seven
and
a
half
in
effect
the
third
of
eight
the
fourth
of
seven
and
a
half
the
fifth
the
same
the
sixth
three
and
a
half
now
each
of
these
lines
taken
individually
has
been
employed
before
and
what
originality
the
raven
has
is
in
their
into
stanzas
nothing
even
remotely
approaching
this
combination
has
ever
been
attempted
the
effect
of
this
originality
of
combination
is
aided
by
other
unusual
and
some
altogether
novel
effects
arising
from
an
extension
of
the
application
of
the
principles
of
rhyme
and
alliteration
the
next
point
to
be
considered
was
the
mode
of
bringing
together
the
lover
and
the
raven
and
the
first
branch
of
this
consideration
was
the
for
this
the
most
natural
suggestion
might
seem
to
be
a
forest
or
the
fields
but
it
has
always
appeared
to
me
that
a
close
of
is
absolutely
necessary
to
the
effect
of
insulated
incident
it
has
the
force
of
a
frame
to
a
picture
it
has
an
indisputable
moral
power
in
keeping
concentrated
the
attention
and
of
course
must
not
be
confounded
with
mere
unity
of
place
i
determined
then
to
place
the
lover
in
his
chamber
in
a
chamber
rendered
sacred
to
him
by
memories
of
her
who
had
frequented
it
the
room
is
represented
as
richly
furnished
this
in
mere
pursuance
of
the
ideas
i
have
already
explained
on
the
subject
of
beauty
as
the
sole
true
poetical
thesis
the
being
thus
determined
i
had
now
to
introduce
the
bird
and
the
thought
of
introducing
him
through
the
window
was
inevitable
the
idea
of
making
the
lover
suppose
in
the
first
instance
that
the
flapping
of
the
wings
of
the
bird
against
the
shutter
is
a
tapping
at
the
door
originated
in
a
wish
to
increase
by
prolonging
the
curiosity
and
in
a
desire
to
admit
the
incidental
effect
arising
from
the
lover
throwing
open
the
door
finding
all
dark
and
thence
adopting
the
that
it
was
the
spirit
of
his
mistress
that
knocked
i
made
the
night
tempestuous
first
to
account
for
the
raven
seeking
admission
and
secondly
for
the
effect
of
contrast
with
the
physical
serenity
within
the
chamber
i
made
the
bird
alight
on
the
bust
of
pallas
also
for
the
effect
of
contrast
between
the
marble
and
the
plumage
it
being
understood
that
the
bust
was
absolutely
by
the
bird
the
bust
of
being
chosen
first
as
most
in
keeping
with
the
scholarship
of
the
lover
and
secondly
for
the
sonorousness
of
the
word
pallas
itself
about
the
middle
of
the
poem
also
i
have
availed
myself
of
the
force
of
contrast
with
a
view
of
deepening
the
ultimate
impression
for
example
an
air
of
the
fantastic
approaching
as
nearly
to
the
ludicrous
as
was
admissible
is
given
to
the
raven
entrance
he
comes
in
with
many
a
flirt
and
flutter
not
the
obeisance
made
not
a
moment
stopped
or
stayed
he
with
mien
of
lord
or
perched
above
my
chamber
door
in
the
two
stanzas
which
follow
the
design
is
more
obviously
carried
out
then
this
ebony
bird
beguiling
my
into
smiling
by
the
and
stern
decorum
of
the
countenance
it
though
thy
be
shorn
and
thou
i
said
art
sure
no
craven
ghastly
grim
and
ancient
raven
wandering
from
the
nightly
shore
tell
me
what
thy
lordly
name
is
on
the
night
plutonian
shore
quoth
the
raven
nevermore
much
i
marvelled
ungainly
to
hear
discourse
so
plainly
though
its
answer
little
meaning
little
relevancy
bore
for
we
can
not
help
agreeing
that
no
living
human
being
yet
was
blessed
with
seeing
bird
above
his
chamber
door
bird
or
beast
upon
the
sculptured
bust
above
his
chamber
with
such
name
as
nevermore
the
effect
of
the
dénouement
being
thus
provided
for
i
immediately
drop
the
fantastic
for
a
tone
of
the
most
profound
seriousness
this
tone
commencing
in
the
stanza
directly
following
the
one
last
quoted
with
the
line
but
the
raven
sitting
lonely
on
that
placid
bust
spoke
only
etc
from
this
epoch
the
lover
no
longer
jests
no
longer
sees
anything
even
of
the
fantastic
in
the
raven
demeanor
he
speaks
of
him
as
a
grim
ungainly
ghastly
gaunt
and
ominous
bird
of
yore
and
feels
the
fiery
eyes
burning
into
his
bosom
core
this
revolution
of
thought
or
fancy
on
the
lover
part
is
intended
to
induce
a
similar
one
on
the
part
of
the
reader
to
bring
the
mind
into
a
proper
frame
for
the
which
is
now
brought
about
as
rapidly
and
as
as
possible
with
the
proper
with
the
raven
reply
nevermore
to
the
lover
final
demand
if
he
shall
meet
his
mistress
in
another
world
the
poem
in
its
obvious
phase
that
of
a
simple
narrative
may
be
said
to
have
its
completion
so
far
everything
is
within
the
limits
of
the
accountable
of
the
real
a
raven
having
learned
by
rote
the
single
word
nevermore
and
having
escaped
from
the
custody
of
its
owner
is
driven
at
midnight
through
the
violence
of
a
storm
to
seek
admission
at
a
window
from
which
a
light
still
gleams
the
of
a
student
occupied
half
in
pouring
over
a
volume
half
in
dreaming
of
a
beloved
mistress
deceased
the
casement
being
thrown
open
at
the
fluttering
of
the
bird
wings
the
bird
itself
perches
on
the
most
convenient
seat
out
of
the
immediate
reach
of
the
student
who
amused
by
the
incident
and
the
oddity
of
the
demeanor
demands
of
it
in
jest
and
with
out
looking
for
a
reply
its
name
the
raven
addressed
answers
with
its
customary
word
nevermore
a
word
which
finds
immediate
echo
in
the
melancholy
heart
of
the
student
who
giving
utterance
aloud
to
certain
thoughts
suggested
by
the
occasion
is
again
startled
by
the
fowl
repetition
of
nevermore
the
student
now
guesses
the
state
of
the
case
but
is
impelled
as
i
have
before
explained
by
the
human
thirst
for
and
in
part
by
superstition
to
propound
such
queries
to
the
bird
as
will
bring
him
the
lover
the
most
of
the
luxury
of
sorrow
through
the
anticipated
answer
nevermore
with
the
indulgence
to
the
extreme
of
this
the
narration
in
what
i
have
termed
its
first
or
obvious
phase
has
a
natural
termination
and
so
far
there
has
been
no
overstepping
of
the
limits
of
the
real
but
in
subjects
so
handled
however
skilfully
or
with
however
vivid
an
array
of
incident
there
is
always
a
certain
hardness
or
nakedness
which
repels
the
artistical
eye
two
things
are
invariably
required
first
some
amount
of
complexity
or
more
properly
adaptation
and
secondly
some
amount
of
suggestiveness
some
undercurrent
however
indefinite
of
meaning
it
is
this
latter
in
especial
which
imparts
to
a
work
of
art
so
much
of
that
to
borrow
from
colloquy
a
forcible
term
which
we
are
too
fond
of
confounding
with
it
is
the
of
the
suggested
meaning
it
is
the
rendering
this
the
upper
instead
of
the
under
current
of
theme
which
turns
into
prose
and
that
of
the
very
flattest
kind
the
poetry
of
the
transcendentalists
holding
these
opinions
i
added
the
two
concluding
stanzas
of
the
poem
their
suggestiveness
being
thus
made
to
pervade
all
the
narrative
which
has
preceded
them
the
undercurrent
of
meaning
is
rendered
first
apparent
in
the
lines
take
thy
beak
from
out
my
heart
and
take
thy
form
from
off
my
door
quoth
the
raven
nevermore
it
will
be
observed
that
the
words
from
out
my
heart
involve
the
first
metaphorical
expression
in
the
poem
they
with
the
answer
nevermore
dispose
the
mind
to
seek
a
moral
in
all
that
has
been
previously
narrated
the
reader
begins
now
to
regard
the
raven
as
emblematical
but
it
is
not
until
the
very
last
line
of
the
very
last
stanza
that
the
intention
of
making
him
emblematical
of
and
is
permitted
distinctly
to
be
seen
and
the
raven
never
flitting
still
is
sitting
still
is
sitting
on
the
pallid
bust
of
pallas
just
above
my
chamber
door
and
his
eyes
have
all
the
seeming
of
a
demon
that
is
dreaming
and
the
lamplight
him
streaming
throws
his
shadow
on
the
floor
and
my
soul
out
that
that
lies
floating
on
the
floor
shall
be
lifted
nevermore
old
english
poetry
it
should
not
be
doubted
that
at
least
of
the
affection
with
which
we
regard
the
elder
poets
of
great
britain
should
be
attributed
to
what
is
in
itself
a
thing
apart
from
poetry
we
mean
to
the
simple
love
of
the
antique
and
that
again
a
third
of
even
the
proper
inspired
by
their
writings
should
be
ascribed
to
a
fact
which
while
it
has
strict
connection
with
poetry
in
the
abstract
and
with
the
old
british
poems
themselves
should
not
be
looked
upon
as
a
merit
appertaining
to
the
authors
of
the
poems
almost
every
devout
admirer
of
the
old
bards
if
demanded
his
opinion
of
their
productions
would
mention
vaguely
yet
with
perfect
sincerity
a
sense
of
dreamy
wild
indefinite
and
he
would
perhaps
say
indefinable
delight
on
being
required
to
point
out
the
source
of
this
so
shadowy
pleasure
he
would
be
apt
to
speak
of
the
quaint
in
phraseology
and
in
general
handling
this
quaintness
is
in
fact
a
very
powerful
adjunct
to
ideality
but
in
the
case
in
question
it
arises
independently
of
the
author
will
and
is
altogether
apart
from
his
intention
words
and
their
rhythm
have
varied
verses
which
affect
us
with
a
vivid
delight
and
which
delight
in
many
instances
may
be
traced
to
the
one
source
quaintness
must
have
worn
in
the
days
of
their
construction
a
very
commonplace
air
this
is
of
course
no
argument
against
the
poems
we
mean
it
only
as
against
the
poets
there
is
a
growing
desire
to
overrate
them
the
old
english
muse
was
frank
guileless
sincere
and
although
very
learned
still
learned
without
art
no
general
error
evinces
a
more
thorough
confusion
of
ideas
than
the
error
of
supposing
donne
and
cowley
metaphysical
in
the
sense
wherein
wordsworth
and
coleridge
are
so
with
the
two
former
ethics
were
the
end
with
the
two
latter
the
means
the
poet
of
the
creation
wished
by
highly
artificial
verse
to
inculcate
what
he
supposed
to
be
moral
truth
the
poet
of
the
ancient
mariner
to
infuse
the
poetic
sentiment
through
channels
suggested
by
analysis
the
one
finished
by
complete
failure
what
he
commenced
in
the
grossest
misconception
the
other
by
a
path
which
could
not
possibly
lead
him
astray
arrived
at
a
triumph
which
is
not
the
less
glorious
because
hidden
from
the
profane
eyes
of
the
multitude
but
in
this
view
even
the
metaphysical
verse
of
cowley
is
but
evidence
of
the
simplicity
and
of
the
man
and
he
was
in
this
but
a
type
of
his
for
we
may
as
well
designate
in
this
way
the
entire
class
of
writers
whose
poems
are
bound
up
in
the
volume
before
us
and
throughout
all
of
whom
there
runs
a
very
perceptible
general
character
they
used
little
art
in
composition
their
writings
sprang
immediately
from
the
soul
and
partook
intensely
of
that
soul
nature
nor
is
it
difficult
to
perceive
the
tendency
of
this
to
elevate
immeasurably
all
the
energies
of
mind
but
again
so
to
mingle
the
greatest
possible
fire
force
delicacy
and
all
good
things
with
the
lowest
possible
bathos
baldness
and
imbecility
as
to
render
it
not
a
matter
of
doubt
that
the
average
results
of
mind
in
such
a
school
will
be
found
inferior
to
those
results
in
one
more
artificial
we
can
not
bring
ourselves
to
believe
that
the
selections
of
the
book
of
gems
are
such
as
will
impart
to
a
poetical
reader
the
clearest
possible
idea
of
the
beauty
of
the
but
if
the
intention
had
been
merely
to
show
the
school
character
the
attempt
might
have
been
considered
successful
in
the
highest
degree
there
are
long
passages
now
before
us
of
the
most
despicable
trash
with
no
merit
whatever
beyond
that
of
their
antiquity
the
criticisms
of
the
editor
do
not
particularly
please
us
his
enthusiasm
is
too
general
and
too
vivid
not
to
be
false
his
opinion
for
example
of
sir
henry
wotton
verses
on
the
queen
of
bohemia
that
there
are
few
finer
things
in
our
language
is
untenable
and
absurd
in
such
lines
we
can
perceive
not
one
of
those
higher
attributes
of
poesy
which
belong
to
her
in
all
circumstances
and
throughout
all
time
here
everything
is
art
nakedly
or
but
awkwardly
concealed
no
prepossession
for
the
mere
antique
and
in
this
case
we
can
imagine
no
other
prepossession
should
induce
us
to
dignify
with
the
sacred
name
of
poetry
a
series
such
as
this
of
elaborate
and
threadbare
compliments
stitched
apparently
together
without
fancy
without
plausibility
and
without
even
an
attempt
at
adaptation
in
common
with
all
the
world
we
have
been
much
delighted
with
the
shepherd
hunting
by
withers
a
poem
partaking
in
a
remarkable
degree
of
the
peculiarities
of
penseroso
speaking
of
poesy
the
author
says
by
the
murmur
of
a
spring
or
the
least
boughs
rustleling
by
a
daisy
whose
leaves
spread
shut
when
titan
goes
to
bed
or
a
shady
bush
or
tree
she
could
more
infuse
in
me
than
all
nature
beauties
con
in
some
other
wiser
man
by
her
help
i
also
now
make
this
churlish
place
allow
something
that
may
sweeten
gladness
in
the
very
gall
of
sadness
the
dull
loneness
the
black
shade
that
these
hanging
vaults
have
made
the
strange
music
of
the
waves
beating
on
these
hollow
caves
this
black
den
which
rocks
emboss
overgrown
with
eldest
moss
the
rude
portals
that
give
light
more
to
terror
than
delight
this
my
chamber
of
neglect
walled
about
with
disrespect
from
all
these
and
this
dull
air
a
fit
object
for
despair
she
hath
taught
me
by
her
might
to
draw
comfort
and
delight
but
these
lines
however
good
do
not
bear
with
them
much
of
the
general
character
of
the
english
antique
something
more
of
this
will
be
found
in
corbet
farewell
to
the
fairies
we
copy
a
portion
of
maiden
lamenting
for
her
fawn
which
we
prefer
not
only
as
a
specimen
of
the
elder
poets
but
in
itself
as
a
beautiful
poem
abounding
in
pathos
exquisitely
delicate
imagination
and
truthfulness
to
anything
of
its
species
it
is
a
wondrous
thing
how
fleet
was
on
those
little
silver
feet
with
what
a
pretty
skipping
grace
it
oft
would
challenge
me
the
race
and
whe
had
left
me
far
away
stay
and
run
again
and
stay
for
it
was
nimbler
much
than
hinds
and
trod
as
if
on
the
four
winds
i
have
a
garden
of
my
own
but
so
with
roses
overgrown
and
lilies
that
you
would
it
guess
to
be
a
little
wilderness
and
all
the
of
the
year
it
only
loved
to
be
there
among
the
beds
of
lilies
i
have
sought
it
oft
where
it
should
lie
yet
could
not
till
itself
would
rise
find
it
although
before
mine
eyes
for
in
the
flaxen
lilies
shade
it
like
a
bank
of
lilies
laid
upon
the
roses
it
would
feed
until
its
lips
even
seemed
to
bleed
and
then
to
me
boldly
trip
and
print
those
roses
on
my
lip
but
all
its
chief
delight
was
still
with
roses
thus
itself
to
fill
and
its
pure
virgin
limbs
to
fold
in
whitest
sheets
of
lilies
cold
had
it
lived
long
it
would
have
been
lilies
without
roses
within
how
truthful
an
air
of
lamentations
hangs
here
upon
every
syllable
it
pervades
all
it
comes
over
the
sweet
melody
of
the
words
over
the
gentleness
and
grace
which
we
fancy
in
the
little
maiden
herself
even
over
the
air
with
which
she
lingers
on
the
beauties
and
good
qualities
of
her
favorite
like
the
cool
shadow
of
a
summer
cloud
over
a
bed
of
lilies
and
violets
and
all
sweet
flowers
the
whole
is
redolent
with
poetry
of
a
very
lofty
order
every
line
is
an
idea
conveying
either
the
beauty
and
playfulness
of
the
fawn
or
the
artlessness
of
the
maiden
or
her
love
or
her
admiration
or
her
grief
or
the
fragrance
and
warmth
and
of
the
little
bed
of
lilies
and
roses
which
the
fawn
devoured
as
it
lay
upon
them
and
could
scarcely
be
distinguished
from
them
by
the
once
happy
little
damsel
who
went
to
seek
her
pet
with
an
arch
and
rosy
smile
on
her
face
consider
the
great
variety
of
truthful
and
delicate
thought
in
the
few
lines
we
have
quoted
the
of
the
little
maiden
at
the
fleetness
of
her
favorite
the
little
silver
feet
the
fawn
challenging
his
mistress
to
a
race
with
a
pretty
skipping
grace
running
on
before
and
then
with
head
turned
back
awaiting
her
approach
only
to
fly
from
it
again
can
we
not
distinctly
perceive
all
these
things
how
exceedingly
vigorous
too
is
the
line
and
trod
as
if
on
the
four
winds
a
vigor
apparent
only
when
we
keep
in
mind
the
artless
character
of
the
speaker
and
the
four
feet
of
the
favorite
one
for
each
wind
then
consider
the
garden
of
my
own
so
overgrown
entangled
with
roses
and
lilies
as
to
be
a
little
wilderness
the
fawn
loving
to
be
there
and
there
only
the
maiden
seeking
it
where
it
lie
and
not
being
able
to
distinguish
it
from
the
flowers
until
itself
would
rise
the
lying
among
the
lilies
like
a
bank
of
lilies
the
loving
to
fill
itself
with
roses
and
its
pure
virgin
limbs
to
fold
in
whitest
sheets
of
lilies
cold
and
these
things
being
its
chief
delights
and
then
the
beauty
and
naturalness
of
the
concluding
lines
whose
very
hyperbole
only
renders
them
more
true
to
nature
when
we
consider
the
innocence
the
artlessness
the
enthusiasm
the
passionate
girl
and
more
passionate
admiration
of
the
bereaved
child
had
it
lived
long
it
would
have
been
lilies
without
roses
