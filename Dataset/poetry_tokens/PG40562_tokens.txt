dance
of
the
snowflakes
let
dance
to
the
brown
old
earth
cried
one
little
flake
of
snow
the
autumn
days
have
all
passed
by
i
tired
of
my
home
here
in
the
sky
so
they
all
agreed
to
go
they
dressed
themselves
in
a
misty
film
of
purest
pearly
white
their
feet
were
clad
in
velvet
down
as
soft
and
white
as
the
filmy
gown
they
wore
to
the
dance
that
night
wrapped
with
a
drape
of
raveled
gauze
were
these
little
fays
so
fair
when
out
from
a
cloud
a
pale
star
beamed
bright
diamonds
sparkled
laughed
and
gleamed
in
their
fleecy
tangled
hair
all
ready
so
pretty
a
crowd
were
they
that
naught
could
their
charms
enhance
then
softly
and
quickly
they
sped
away
for
the
wind
was
the
cab
that
they
rode
in
to
the
snowflakes
dance
they
flew
over
housetop
hilltop
dell
with
dances
and
with
delight
though
did
sound
of
their
presence
tell
wherever
their
fairy
footsteps
fell
all
turned
to
a
crystal
white
in
the
daintiest
robes
the
trees
were
dressed
that
ever
you
wish
to
see
the
wayworn
traveler
he
was
blessed
and
stroked
and
kissed
and
by
these
fays
in
rapturous
glee
into
every
crevice
and
crack
they
peeped
they
danced
till
the
morning
light
they
left
the
print
of
their
tiny
feet
country
road
and
city
street
in
frolicsome
fun
that
night
when
the
rosy
face
of
the
morning
sun
peeped
timidly
out
to
view
he
beheld
the
earth
last
night
so
brown
arrayed
in
a
velvet
gown
that
sparkled
like
dancing
dew
an
october
day
is
sunrise
the
eastern
hills
all
hail
thou
lovely
morn
thy
tender
blush
thy
mellow
light
proclaim
the
autumn
born
all
nature
is
so
wondrous
fair
bedecked
with
golden
sheen
a
fleecy
cloudlet
here
and
there
in
azure
sky
is
seen
the
gold
and
crimson
leaves
that
give
the
trees
their
autumn
gown
are
scattered
by
the
gentle
breeze
upon
the
meadows
brown
tho
summer
that
were
so
fair
have
faded
one
by
one
the
goldenrod
in
beauty
rare
her
reign
has
just
begun
the
grapevines
now
are
laden
with
sweet
clusters
oh
so
blue
and
scattered
the
orchard
ground
are
rosy
apples
too
oh
who
could
sigh
for
summer
skies
for
summer
flowers
and
trees
for
singing
birds
and
rainbow
showers
autumn
scenes
like
these
as
sinks
the
glorious
king
of
day
adown
the
western
sky
he
bathes
the
trees
and
hilltops
in
a
flood
of
crimson
dye
he
sets
the
westland
all
aglow
before
he
sinks
away
so
endeth
as
a
beauteous
dream
this
lovely
autumn
day
welcome
sweet
may
welcome
sweet
may
with
thy
sunshine
and
showers
driven
away
old
winter
dark
hours
poor
fellow
he
seemed
rather
loth
to
depart
till
thou
with
thy
sunshine
compelled
him
to
start
welcome
sweet
may
welcome
sweet
may
that
bringest
to
me
wherever
i
stray
a
sweet
memory
when
fragrant
pink
blossoms
hung
thick
overhead
and
love
lay
asleep
in
a
violet
bed
welcome
sweet
may
welcome
sweet
may
with
thy
sunshine
and
showers
when
young
love
awoke
from
sleep
the
flowers
each
year
in
thy
sunshine
heavens
of
blue
with
thy
sweet
fragrant
blossoms
he
wakened
anew
welcome
sweet
may
lakeside
is
the
dearest
coolest
place
i
can
find
there
the
locust
and
the
wild
grape
entwined
float
their
dewy
fragrance
ever
the
dancing
joe
river
on
the
wings
of
the
soft
drowsy
wind
in
the
coziest
of
homes
neat
and
new
dwell
its
people
so
and
true
not
a
wall
or
tower
high
mars
the
tender
sunlight
sky
or
shuts
out
the
glad
rainbow
from
view
when
a
dwelling
for
his
mate
is
in
quest
does
the
robin
find
its
shelter
the
best
there
his
sweetest
notes
he
brings
and
a
flood
of
music
flings
your
head
as
you
pass
his
nest
there
are
dripping
with
dew
and
the
dogwood
blossoms
hang
over
you
in
a
drowse
of
rapture
sweet
does
this
vale
look
up
to
meet
and
to
bask
in
the
smile
of
the
blue
would
your
soul
free
from
troubles
be
made
all
its
worries
and
its
burdens
unlade
from
the
tumult
and
the
heat
of
the
noisy
city
street
take
yourself
to
the
bliss
of
its
shade
there
you
drink
till
you
stagger
as
you
plod
of
the
sweets
from
the
sod
while
your
weary
frame
is
drenched
and
your
thirsty
soul
is
quenched
in
a
shower
of
the
great
love
of
god
the
above
is
a
description
of
the
lakeside
addition
to
wayne
ind
autumn
enchanting
dawn
of
autumn
days
so
clear
so
cool
so
calm
all
creation
breathing
forth
thy
sweet
refreshing
balm
the
woodland
dons
its
brightest
hue
its
gown
each
soft
and
dreamy
breeze
that
blows
brings
showers
of
crimson
down
old
earth
now
groans
beneath
her
load
of
grain
and
fruited
vine
that
thickly
hangs
orchard
wall
and
drips
with
mellow
wine
the
birds
fly
lazily
above
bathed
in
thy
misty
light
while
on
the
hillside
loll
the
kine
in
morning
gold
delight
wrapped
in
thy
folds
of
golden
mist
this
restless
soul
of
mine
is
lulled
into
a
blissful
dream
of
peace
and
love
divine
to
a
sweet
flower
what
cold
unfeeling
hand
hath
plucked
thee
from
that
shady
land
where
clear
cool
waters
lie
and
velvet
mosses
kissed
thy
feet
who
took
thee
from
thy
loved
retreat
and
left
thee
here
to
die
thou
fairest
gem
of
all
the
earth
bonnie
wilds
that
gave
thee
birth
thy
petals
sweetness
hold
i
drink
thy
breath
in
fragrant
draught
sweeter
than
royal
lips
quaffed
from
cups
of
burnished
gold
who
took
thee
from
thy
crystal
home
where
finny
tribes
delight
to
roam
and
frisk
in
morning
play
where
never
harsher
sound
was
heard
than
fall
of
leaf
or
trill
of
bird
or
winds
that
softly
sway
the
trees
that
bend
thy
nook
above
and
bending
whispered
low
of
love
to
thee
my
bonnie
flower
or
whir
of
swallows
silken
flight
across
the
waves
the
calm
delight
of
evening
dappling
shower
although
crushed
beneath
my
feet
thy
dewy
fragrance
is
more
sweet
than
at
thy
frail
life
dawn
thus
of
love
and
purity
this
lesson
i
have
learned
of
thee
that
when
my
friends
are
gone
and
fate
rude
tread
has
crushed
my
heart
its
blossoms
shall
more
sweets
impart
than
at
its
first
love
dawn
the
cyclone
how
still
the
morn
no
leaf
is
stirred
nor
fruited
branches
sway
save
now
and
then
from
dewy
glen
a
breath
of
hay
or
blossoms
of
the
summertide
is
wafted
up
the
mountain
side
how
softly
floats
the
cuckoo
song
across
the
sleeping
vale
in
mystic
glee
the
echo
free
gives
back
the
fairy
tale
the
stream
in
drowsy
ecstasy
is
gurgling
onward
to
the
sea
the
lark
swims
slowly
in
the
blue
the
giant
oaks
so
high
in
sunlit
haze
their
branches
raise
as
if
to
kiss
the
sky
we
hear
above
the
twittering
birds
the
placid
lowing
of
the
herds
the
silvery
laughter
from
the
lips
of
children
at
their
play
and
in
the
rill
below
the
mill
the
horses
paw
and
neigh
while
youths
and
maidens
plight
their
vows
and
workmen
sing
behind
the
plows
the
noon
is
here
the
sky
is
clear
and
tender
as
the
morn
the
ploughman
blest
with
perfect
rest
where
noontime
shade
is
born
the
bird
has
ceased
his
song
to
trill
the
lowing
of
the
herd
is
still
unnoticed
a
dark
speck
appears
above
the
trees
on
high
at
rapid
pace
and
fast
increase
it
scuds
across
the
sky
nor
stops
to
rest
sea
or
lands
till
this
lovely
vale
it
stands
an
instant
then
as
if
possessed
of
some
aerial
deil
with
shriek
and
yell
this
imp
of
hell
swoops
down
upon
the
vale
snatches
the
giant
oaks
from
earth
that
nourished
them
and
gave
them
birth
and
hurls
them
the
mountain
side
one
sweep
of
its
black
wings
and
all
is
and
as
before
the
streamlet
laughs
and
sings
but
carries
on
its
sunny
tide
fragments
of
debris
to
the
wide
and
surging
sea
the
shattered
boughs
of
oaks
that
proudly
grew
beside
the
stream
is
it
a
dream
no
there
a
baby
shoe
the
sunset
crimson
rays
are
shed
soft
the
dying
and
the
dead
while
angels
hover
near
and
spread
their
dewy
shadows
the
vale
where
morn
in
joy
was
born
a
blackened
pile
but
for
the
song
of
one
lone
like
to
the
morning
all
is
still
sunset
on
the
lake
is
evening
on
winona
lake
the
last
glad
sunbeams
rest
shedding
their
golden
glories
her
soft
and
silken
breast
and
as
my
little
boat
glides
forth
into
their
light
behold
the
splashes
from
my
oars
are
like
great
drops
of
liquid
gold
and
now
a
softer
richer
hue
the
western
sky
trees
hilltops
water
everything
seems
bathed
in
crimson
dye
and
the
bosom
of
the
lake
soft
summer
breezes
glide
bringing
incense
from
the
lilies
on
the
other
side
i
wonder
oh
i
wonder
so
if
in
that
world
of
bliss
where
sunsets
never
come
there
aught
more
beautiful
than
this
oh
father
time
if
thou
from
me
all
else
that
lovely
take
leave
only
in
my
memory
this
sunset
on
the
lake
to
my
wheel
bonnie
my
steed
though
a
bit
out
of
style
we
traveled
together
full
many
a
mile
yet
nothing
can
give
me
such
perfect
delight
as
to
spring
to
thy
saddle
and
spin
out
of
sight
away
from
the
city
of
turmoil
and
strife
away
from
the
cares
that
beset
business
life
to
a
shady
country
retreat
where
hearts
ever
loving
may
placidly
beat
away
over
pathways
with
dewdrops
bespangled
where
myrtle
and
wild
are
tangled
and
the
violet
borrows
its
velvety
hue
from
the
radiance
of
heaven
own
blue
and
cowslips
and
buttercups
grow
where
we
tread
the
breeze
whispers
soft
through
the
trees
overhead
as
showers
of
pink
blossoms
with
fragrance
so
rare
they
shed
the
ground
over
us
everywhere
thou
faithful
old
friend
always
ready
to
go
found
out
of
order
like
others
i
know
and
when
off
we
go
for
a
nice
little
spin
unlike
others
never
left
me
to
walk
in
exchange
for
another
that
handsome
and
new
no
no
bonnie
steed
i
will
not
part
with
you
but
when
thou
art
old
and
thy
usefulness
in
a
nice
cozy
attic
thy
frame
i
will
store
and
every
day
be
it
sunshine
or
rain
i
steal
to
thy
side
and
in
fancy
again
we
skim
the
green
meadows
my
steed
you
and
i
the
flowers
that
grow
the
soft
tender
sky
then
come
let
us
bask
in
the
dewy
delight
of
the
country
hi
ho
we
are
soon
out
of
sight
though
a
bit
out
of
style
just
the
same
is
thy
speed
i
love
thee
i
love
thee
my
bonnie
bright
steed
despondency
oh
balmy
night
a
night
in
june
what
endless
beauties
thine
hast
thou
a
balm
gently
breathe
tired
souls
like
mine
the
cricket
the
old
porch
floor
chirps
forth
a
merry
lay
the
roses
nod
and
smile
at
me
a
sweet
they
say
oh
cricket
hush
your
merry
song
how
can
you
be
so
gay
ye
roses
bow
your
crimson
heads
and
mourn
my
vanished
day
an
garden
how
oft
from
the
din
of
the
hard
city
street
the
show
and
the
splendor
in
fancy
my
feet
stray
backward
through
paths
that
are
dripping
with
dew
to
an
garden
my
babyhood
knew
a
wealth
of
red
roses
hung
over
the
wall
and
laden
with
pink
downy
peaches
a
tall
and
willowy
tree
did
its
long
branches
sway
as
you
passed
in
an
inviting
way
while
from
its
green
shelter
the
oriole
song
rode
on
the
soft
breezes
the
summer
day
long
the
flourished
in
rows
near
the
wall
the
sugar
corn
waved
its
soft
leaves
over
all
and
buttercups
daisies
and
peonies
grew
the
fragrant
june
pinks
and
the
wee
bells
of
blue
the
marigolds
poppies
and
pansies
so
sweet
lifted
their
dewy
faces
towards
heaven
to
meet
the
first
smile
of
morning
the
fragrant
sweet
pea
wound
its
delicate
tendrils
round
pickets
and
we
to
drowsiness
drank
of
the
odor
it
spilled
while
sunflowers
nodded
to
us
as
we
filled
our
baskets
with
blossoms
for
table
bouquets
or
lolled
in
the
bliss
of
the
soft
morning
haze
or
with
aprons
outspread
in
our
childish
delight
the
butterfly
chased
in
his
foraging
flight
the
flowers
or
the
hummer
that
gay
little
thief
that
pilfered
the
sweets
from
each
petal
and
leaf
but
long
years
ago
the
old
garden
was
sold
its
walls
rustic
gates
are
all
crumbled
to
mold
its
beds
and
smooth
pathways
hid
for
the
breezes
of
are
whispering
the
flowers
that
blossom
her
pallet
above
who
tended
that
garden
i
love
and
singing
their
lullaby
sweetest
where
lies
my
playmate
and
sister
with
bonnie
blue
eyes
and
i
hope
when
my
sojourn
of
usefulness
here
is
past
to
the
place
that
my
bosom
holds
dear
i
may
go
and
there
pillow
my
head
the
tree
where
robin
and
oriole
chirrup
in
glee
while
my
soul
slips
away
from
the
spot
that
i
love
to
gardens
that
grow
up
above
dance
of
the
ripples
i
stood
one
night
by
the
old
joe
where
the
moonbeams
love
to
loiter
watching
the
ripples
come
and
go
and
the
willow
trees
their
shadows
throw
on
the
mystic
water
as
i
lingered
there
on
the
bank
where
the
pale
rays
glint
and
quiver
through
the
silvered
leaves
a
perfumed
breeze
so
softly
swayed
the
willow
trees
and
dappled
the
laughing
river
the
waters
murmured
so
low
and
sweet
then
an
echo
soft
and
clear
not
the
sound
of
lute
or
song
of
bird
but
the
sweetest
music
ever
heard
fell
on
my
enchanted
ear
the
silvered
ripples
all
leaped
for
joy
and
over
the
waters
glancing
i
saw
in
the
light
a
pretty
sight
in
an
ecstasy
of
glad
delight
the
ripples
all
were
dancing
they
danced
in
the
midst
where
the
stars
look
down
no
shadowy
branch
to
hide
them
they
danced
where
the
willows
kiss
the
stream
then
back
again
in
the
moonlight
gleam
and
the
fish
peeped
out
and
eyed
them
they
danced
in
the
shade
of
the
iron
bridge
where
the
aspen
shadows
play
and
the
great
moon
smiled
as
the
dancers
fled
and
spangles
dropped
on
each
little
head
as
they
laughed
and
danced
away
the
pessimist
arrayed
in
a
garment
of
fleeciest
down
the
rides
over
meadows
so
brown
through
wild
wailing
woodlands
so
stark
and
so
bare
he
rides
on
the
wind
to
the
great
everywhere
he
dresses
the
trees
in
the
daintiest
gown
and
over
each
window
in
country
and
town
with
fingers
unheard
and
unseen
he
pictures
in
crystal
and
silvery
sheen
most
beautiful
cities
with
steeples
and
towers
and
wild
tangled
mazes
bespangled
with
flowers
but
the
sweet
music
of
jingling
bells
you
hear
the
old
pessimist
counting
his
ills
with
a
sorrowful
shake
of
the
head
murmurs
he
such
nasty
cold
weather
i
never
did
see
the
streets
are
so
one
ca
walk
at
all
for
danger
of
breaking
a
leg
by
a
fall
unless
a
few
days
bring
a
great
change
about
the
wheat
in
the
ground
will
be
all
frozen
out
but
roguish
old
winter
soon
bundles
his
pack
of
ice
frost
and
snow
on
his
jolly
old
back
and
hies
to
the
mountain
but
leaves
in
his
stead
the
goddess
of
love
with
the
head
and
a
breath
that
is
filled
with
the
nectar
and
dew
she
stole
from
the
heart
of
the
violet
blue
a
voice
o
the
music
that
swells
on
the
air
from
woodland
from
hedge
everywhere
caressed
by
the
sunlight
and
bathed
by
the
showers
she
walks
on
a
carpet
of
mosses
and
flowers
again
comes
the
pessimist
grumpy
and
grim
and
says
the
fair
goddess
has
no
charms
for
him
is
raining
too
often
the
corn
and
the
wheat
will
rot
in
the
ground
there
be
nothing
to
eat
besides
the
old
crow
in
his
greedy
delight
now
raideth
the
cornfields
from
morning
till
night
a
famine
is
certain
is
sure
to
prevail
and
thus
the
old
pessimist
keeps
up
his
wail
at
last
this
fair
goddess
descends
from
the
throne
gives
place
to
another
we
all
loved
and
known
her
crown
is
of
roses
her
garment
of
grain
with
silken
folds
falling
and
rising
again
as
wind
their
soft
billows
plays
enraptured
she
basks
in
the
blue
summer
haze
till
bliss
is
dissolved
into
showers
that
drench
all
the
trees
and
refresh
all
the
flowers
as
softly
they
fall
on
the
roof
our
heads
o
the
rapture
their
lullaby
sheds
though
harvest
with
plenty
his
hath
filled
the
murmuring
pessimist
never
is
stilled
he
says
as
he
brushes
the
sweat
from
his
brow
i
do
see
the
use
of
such
hot
weather
now
dry
up
the
fruit
the
grapes
on
the
vine
unless
there
a
change
they
will
yield
us
no
wine
and
thus
the
old
pessimist
grumbles
away
the
brightness
and
joy
of
the
long
summer
day
he
teases
the
evening
he
teases
the
morn
until
the
fair
goddess
of
autumn
is
born
she
comes
with
fruit
from
the
vine
sweet
clusters
that
drip
with
the
mellowest
wine
and
fruit
from
the
old
and
ears
that
are
golden
as
golden
can
be
enrobed
in
a
garment
of
crimson
and
brown
a
garland
of
goldenrod
forming
her
crown
in
the
mystic
delight
of
the
autumn
she
stands
and
showers
her
gifts
the
pessimist
lands
while
he
from
his
turns
in
disgust
saying
labor
avails
me
but
dust
mould
and
rust
the
winter
comes
on
altogether
too
fast
the
corn
that
unhusked
will
be
caught
in
the
blast
my
bills
they
increase
while
my
business
is
slow
i
soon
shall
be
broken
and
bankrupt
i
know
there
no
satisfaction
on
land
or
on
sea
for
nothing
is
what
i
desire
it
to
be
say
pessimist
say
while
you
grumble
and
fret
know
ye
not
there
is
one
who
your
needs
wo
forget
think
ye
the
kind
father
of
wisdom
so
great
forgetteth
the
things
which
his
hands
did
create
the
sparrow
sings
neither
by
day
nor
by
night
yet
he
in
his
tenderness
guideth
its
flight
he
maketh
the
lily
of
hue
and
feeds
it
on
showers
on
sunshine
and
dew
yet
lives
there
a
king
in
such
garments
arrayed
such
beauty
as
robes
this
sweet
flower
of
the
glade
in
rapturous
reign
the
cool
waters
beside
it
looks
up
and
trusts
and
its
needs
are
supplied
the
richest
of
treasures
to
thee
will
be
given
if
thou
like
the
lily
wilt
look
up
to
heaven
the
first
easter
dawn
the
night
is
past
the
thunder
roar
in
distance
dies
away
and
in
the
east
a
gleam
of
light
foretells
the
coming
day
and
women
bearing
spices
sweet
are
on
their
way
toward
that
tomb
so
dark
and
deep
where
jesus
body
lay
but
who
these
faithful
women
ask
and
pause
upon
their
way
when
we
have
reached
our
master
tomb
who
roll
the
stone
away
at
last
they
reach
the
hallowed
spot
the
tomb
that
joseph
made
wherein
three
days
before
their
loved
and
loving
lord
was
laid
the
glory
of
the
golden
sun
fills
budding
woods
with
light
the
morning
dewdrops
sparkle
on
the
easter
lilies
white
sweet
odor
from
the
hyacinth
upon
the
breeze
is
borne
all
nature
now
proclaims
with
joy
it
is
the
world
first
morn
the
women
stand
beside
the
tomb
in
deep
surprise
and
fear
for
lo
the
stone
is
rolled
away
their
master
is
not
there
impulsive
mary
magdalene
stays
not
but
hastens
on
that
she
may
tell
the
wondrous
news
to
peter
and
to
john
she
tells
them
and
they
come
with
her
unto
the
hallowed
place
and
find
it
just
as
she
has
said
of
jesus
there
no
trace
then
silently
they
turn
and
go
each
on
his
way
save
one
is
loving
mary
magdalene
who
stays
and
weeps
alone
she
thinking
now
of
days
when
friends
away
from
her
all
turned
when
thoughtless
mary
magdalene
by
all
the
world
was
spurned
how
jesus
in
his
wondrous
love
had
touched
her
heart
within
and
led
her
into
righteous
paths
from
those
of
vilest
sin
and
as
she
weeps
she
stoops
and
looks
into
the
sepulcher
and
sees
two
angels
sitting
there
who
kindly
say
to
her
why
weepest
thou
oh
woman
and
magdalene
replies
because
they
taken
away
my
lord
i
know
not
where
he
lies
as
mary
speaks
she
turns
around
another
form
is
there
she
thinks
it
is
the
gardener
who
kindly
says
to
her
whom
seekest
thou
oh
woman
why
stand
ye
weeping
there
says
mary
if
you
borne
him
hence
oh
please
sir
tell
me
where
the
saviour
loving
heart
is
touched
for
it
is
he
who
speaks
her
loving
lord
and
master
whom
so
earnestly
she
seeks
he
draws
a
little
closer
now
that
she
her
lord
may
know
and
answers
only
mary
in
accents
soft
and
low
she
raises
now
her
tearful
eyes
they
are
no
longer
blind
for
none
but
he
could
speak
her
name
so
tenderly
and
kind
forgetting
in
her
love
so
blind
the
cause
for
which
he
died
forgetting
save
at
his
feet
no
harm
can
her
betide
with
beating
heart
and
outstretched
arms
she
flies
her
lord
to
greet
rabboni
then
she
kneels
among
the
lilies
at
his
feet
he
looks
with
pity
on
that
face
with
tears
still
wet
and
says
you
must
not
touch
me
now
i
will
not
leave
you
yet
but
by
and
by
i
will
ascend
unto
my
god
and
thine
go
thou
and
tell
when
thou
dost
find
those
true
disciples
mine
the
day
is
spent
the

her
leaves
upon
her
breast
the

their
dewy

weary
of

tumult
of

the
burdens
and
the
cares
that
weigh
me
down
of

with

beguiles
though
he
warble
so
blandly
his
old
heart
is
false
though
friendly
for
he
lingers
near
me
but
when
fortune
smiles
weary
of
his
griefs
and
empty
show
to
the
quiet
woods
alone
i
love
to
go
and
in
sweet
repose
abide
where
the
sylvan
echoes
ride
on
october
drowsy
winds
that
whisper
low
where
the
bonnie
squirrel
flits
among
the
trees
and
the
quail
his
piping
flings
upon
the
breeze
where
the
gold
and
brown
leaves
quiver
the
winding
osiered
river
bearing
on
its
soft
low
music
to
the
seas
and
the
forest
oak
so
grand
majestic
high
with
his
branches
woos
the
sky
and
the
wind
a
fairy
story
breathing
the
maple
glory
brings
it
down
in
twirling
crimson
showers
where
lie
many
springtime
flowers
fast
asleep
spreading
over
them
a
cover
warm
and
deep
and
the
sunlight
glints
and
spangles
through
the
wild
and
woody
tangles
where
alone
the
eye
of
god
doth
vigils
keep
standing
there
on
wild
sod
where
perhaps
no
human
foot
before
hath
trod
my
soul
is
blest
in
a
halo
of
sweet
rest

alone

the
crimson

sweet
violet
of
modest
dainty
grace
why
dost
thou
hide
among
the
grass
thy
pretty
velvet
face
thine
eyes
are
filled
with
dew
thy
breath
makes
sweet
the
air
of
spring
thy
whispers
low
sweet
memories
of
other

bring
sweet
olden
golden

when
bluebirds
sang
so
gay
as
i
plucked
thy
sister
blossoms
from
a
woodland
far
away
with
her
whose
eyes
in
color
sweet
were
just
like
you
and
like
you
grew
in
radiance
from
drinking
heaven
blue
each
spring
as
lisping
children
as
romping
schoolgirls
too
our
feet
were
bathed
in
violet
banks
that
dripped
with
melting
dew
our
souls
were
bathed
in
bliss
divine
as
all
day
long
we
basked
in
sweet
and
fragrant
winds
we
knew
had
kissed
them
as
they
passed
but
when
the
summer
sun
shone
hot
their
slender
stems
were
dried
their
modest
heads
bent
lower
and
their
fragrant
blossoms
died
and
could
we
pierce
the
blue
of
heaven
dome
so
fair
methinks
we
see
them
blooming
in
celestial
glory
there
culled
by
our
angel

a
rapturous
clime
that
lies
in

bringing
back

of
you

of

that
to

was
singing
a
song
to
his

may
see
the
cheerful
busy
little
bee
from
out
this
dainty
crimson
sip
nectar
for
his
winter
store
the
sky
is
blue
and

portray
the
beauties
of
this
sweet
june
day
in
dear
it
takes
me
back
along
life
sunny
backward
track
just
thirteen
years
to
a
sweet
june
day
and
a
little
cot
not
far
away
where
roses
bloomed
and
song
of
bird
throughout
the
livelong
day
was
heard
but
never
was
this
song
so
gay
as
on
that
blissful
bright
june
day
within
that
little
cot
on
earth
the
dearest
sweetest
spot
a
wee
pink
flower
both
sweet
and
gay
first
opened
to
the
light
of
day
as
time
flew
by
on
fairy
wing
this
wee
pink
flower
this
dainty
thing
of
all
our
love
demanded
part
and
twined
its
tendrils
each
heart
sometimes
without
was
dark
and
dreary
but
all
within
this
cot
was
cheery
because
this
little
floweret
gay
chased
gloom
and
shadows
all
away
this
dainty
thing
so
dear
to
me
this
little
flower
i
have
in
thee
blue
june

and
rainbow

long

christmas
on
the
farm
do
you
remember
oh
brother
mine
what
fun
we
had
at
out
on
the
old
farm
you
and
i
that
home
we
loved
in
days
gone
by
how
up
in
the
loft
we
used
to
climb
for
nuts
stored
there
in
to
crack
and
eat
by
the
dear
old
fire
while
the
cheerful
blaze
leaped
and
and
when
it
was
time
to
go
to
bed
how
each
tired
sleepy
little
head
was
laid
on
a
pillow
soft
and
white
to
dream
of
christmas
the
livelong
night
and
how
in
the
morn
before
was
light
our
eyes
were
opened
wide
and
bright
as
we
ran
a
race
down
the
high
old
stair
to
see
if
santa
had
been
there
and
brought
his
bundle
of
toys
with
him
and
filled
our
stockings
up
to
the
brim
but
dear
old
santa
would
always
stop
and
fill
them
full
to
the
very
top
then
we
away
to
the
old
hillside
the
country
shoemaker
cot
beside
just
the
corner
near
the
wood
where
the
tall
old
grew
and
stood
and
the
snowbirds
hopped
on
its
boughs
awry
as
our
sled
went
whizzing
by
and
down
to
the
foot
of
the
hill
we
go
over
the
crystal
christmas
snow
oh
could
life
downward
journey
be
as
free
from
care
for
you
and
me
our
hearts
be
filled
with
the
same
glad
rays
of
those
olden
golden
christmas
days
when
life
was
so
sunny
bright
and
new
oh
brother
mine
for
me
and
you
a
happier
home
none
ever
had
than
ours
holding
hearts
so
light
and
glad
but
those
happy
christmas
days
of
yore
to
us
will
come
again
no
more
for
she
who
chased
all
our
care
away
sings
a
christmas
anthem
in
heaven
my
little
sweetheart
when
evening
shadows
gather
round
and
work
of
day
is
done
when
down
the
west
horizon
sinks
the
glorious
golden
sun
and
sweetly
sing
the
ode
to
the
closing
day
back
to
my
home
among
the
hills
my
visions
often
stray
chorus
tho
time
from
may
efface
all
else
that
sweet
and
tender
those
happy
olden
golden
days
i
ever
shall
remember
oh
happy
olden
golden
days
oh
days
with
sunshine
laden
when
i
wandered
those
verdant
hills
with
a
little
maiden
where
flowers
were
fair
and
fields
were
green
and
trees
with
blossoms
lade
was
there
i
met
and
loved
and
wooed
a
little
maid
and
oftentimes
she
sing
to
me
sweetly
her
flower
song
as
those
verdant
flowery
hills
we
gaily
strolled
along
chorus
but
that
was
years
long
years
ago
yet
and
again
in
dreams
i
with
my
love
and
hear
that
sweet
refrain
tho
death
cold
frost
has
touched
my
flower
and
bid
its
life
depart
yet
still
within
my
soul
doth
live
my
little
sweetheart
chorus
i
know
two
eyes
song
i
know
two
eyes
two
eyes
yet
fond
and
true
and
tender
i
see
them
in
the
twinkling
stars
and
in
the
glowing
ember
you
girls
may
talk
of
sweet
blue
eyes
or
on
soft
brown
eyes
tarry
but
i
will
take
those
eyes
so
sparkling
bright
and
merry
they
come
to
me
at
twilight
hour
they
come
in
morning
early
they
come
my
every
joy
to
share
those
eyes
so
merry
they
come
at
noon
and
when
i
sad
they
look
at
me
so
kindly
their
sparkling
glance
dwells
on
me
oh
so
fondly
i
know
two
eyes
two
eyes
yet
fond
and
true
and
tender
they
bright
as
any
twinkling
star
up
in
the
heavens
yonder
i
look
into
those
sparkling
eyes
those
eyes
so
merry
and
see
within
their
radiant
depths
the
of
my
dearie
cupid
mistake
cupid
looked
forth
one
bright
spring
day
and
whispered
now
i
must
away
old
winter
with
his
frost
and
snow
took
his
departure
long
ago
roadside
field
and
woodland
too
sweet
violets
grow
with
eyes
so
blue
blossoms
of
every
hue
and
shade
the
balmy
air
with
perfume
lade
there
light
and
sunshine
everywhere
all
nature
is
so
wondrous
fair
from
the
woods
the
wild
birds
sing
a
welcome
to
the
newborn
spring
this
surely
is
my
harvest
time
to
make
men
bow
at
love
sweet
shrine
for
all
around
below
above
will
help
me
make
men
fall
in
love
so
from
beneath
his
tent
he
started
on
this
mission
bent
first
to
the
halls
of
wealth
and
rank
went
cunning
cupid
with
his
prank
on
reaching
them
to
his
dismay
those
halls
in
deepest
quiet
lay
and
music
once
the
food
of
love
could
not
be
heard
below
above
so
cupid
little
wings
he
spread
and
flying
to
himself
he
said
the
lawyer
will
be
in
i
know
he
poring
his
books
i
trow
poor
fellow
what
a
lot
is
his
to
be
shut
up
a
day
like
this
from
sunlight
flowers
and
wild
bird
song
trying
to
balance
right
and
wrong
i
take
my
tiny
little
dart
and
lightly
touch
the
lawyer
heart
and
show
him
how
love
sweet
glad
light
can
make
his
dingy
office
bright
but
when
he
reached
the
spot
he
found
the
studious
lawyer
not
these
words
he
read
upon
the
door
the
lawyer
will
be
in
at
four
to
the
office
of
the
doctor
kind
i
go
said
he
for
there
i
find
him
tending
to
his
patients
ills
with
soothing
balms
and
dainty
pills
but
doctor
doors
were
closed
and
lo
just
as
poor
cupid
turned
to
go
these
words
he
read
tears
alack
at
six
the
doctor
will
be
back
next
to
the
dentist
man
he
flew
and
called
upon
the
merchant
too
in
every
place
the
city
but
not
a
bit
of
game
he
found
well
well
said
cupid
with
a
moan
the
world
has
cold
and
heartless
grown
so
once
again
his
wings
he
spread
and
over
country
roads
he
sped
back
toward
his
home
among
spring
flowers
and
shady
walks
and
leafy
bowers
but
as
he
flew
the
stream
beside
a
crowd
of
wheelmen
there
he
spied
ha
ha
laughed
he
i
found
them
all
both
short
and
tall
both
great
and
small
oh
what
a
pretty
lad
i
see
gliding
along
so
merrily
with
pretty
boots
laced
to
the
knee
his
limbs
how
shapely
blithe
and
free
if
i
can
get
such
game
as
he
this
trip
a
grand
success
will
be
so
saying
this
his
bow
he
bent
and
through
the
air
his
arrow
sent
straight
toward
this
pretty
lad
it
flew
and
pierced
his
bosom
through
and
through
my
was
that
a
blissful
aim
i
fly
to
earth
and
get
my
game
but
when
he
reached
that
laddie
side
he
looked
perplexed
then
horrified
then
quickly
rose
and
flew
away
and
as
he
went
was
heard
to
say
oh
what
a
blunder
now
i
see
fort
wayne
is
not
the
place
for
me
for
counting
now
my
time
and
cost
this
lovely
day
is
worse
than
lost
my
wings
are
weary
brain
awhirl
for
oh
was
but
a
bloomer
girl
dewey
victory
is
morning
at
manila
the
first
dawn
of
the
may
along
the
eastern
horizon
we
see
the
light
of
day
as
spreads
its
golden
splendor
and
drives
away
the
night
the
hills
that
guard
the
islands
are
decked
with
diamonds
bright
the
cocoa
palms
so
olden
now
robed
in
silvered
green
stretch
their
broad
branches
to
golden
fields
serene
and
yon
cathedral
spire
gleams
with
glory
from
the
skies
the
beauty
of
the
sabbath
across
the
city
lies
a
little
bay
rests
softly
among
those
isles
reflecting
heaven
azure
and
basking
in
god
smiles
upon
its
sleeping
waters
a
spanish
squadron
lies
her
flags
unfurl
their
folds
and
upon
sweet
breezes
rise
lo
another
fleet
approaches
more
beauteous
and
grand
the
flag
she
bears
so
proudly
has
waved
freedom
land
she
comes
across
the
billows
and
in
freedom
cause
the
smoke
and
fire
of
battle
enfold
manila

look
on

cavite
they
firing
their
efforts

shattered
into
splinters
and
spanish

grow
pale
the
cannons
belch
forth

the
shells
burst
thick
and
fast
with
might
charge
freedom
heroes
amid
the
purple

the
handsome

reina

sinking
now
she
robed
in
flames
and

from

now
all
the

its
proud
and
dauntless

sinks
the
storm
of

this
morn
her

waved

vales
and

ring
with
shouts
of

noble

battle
of

just
off
the
coast
of
an
isle
that
lies
where
silver
feathery
rise
as
if
their
branches
would
kiss
the
skies
so
blue
so
far
away
when
woke
each
vale
the
sabbath
bell
on
seas
that
gently
rose
and
fell
our
nation
warships
lay
as
dreamily
lazily
basking
they
in
quiet
tropical
sunshine
lay
in
sight
of
a
placid
sleeping
bay
where
anchored
the
spaniard
ships
a
big
boat
coming
from
the
bay
the
spaniard
squadron
comes
this
way
came
loud
from
a
lookout
lips
as
one
by
one
came
the
fleet
of
spain
across
the
bay
toward
the
main
with
hope
in
each
bosom
they
once
again
launched
forth
on
open
sea
each
man
to
his
gun
the
commodore
cried
and
the
warships
plowed
through
the
cloven
tide
in
the
trail
of
the
enemy
full
speed
ahead
open
fire
the
commodore
voice
rose
and
smoke
and
flames
to
the
enemy
the
gallant
fleet
plunged
on
the
cannons
poured
forth
fire
and
thunder
the
great
shells
cleft
the
waves
asunder
as
gun
replied
to
gun
right
through
the
hot
and
shell
through
mist
and
smoke
and
shot
that
fell
ship
and
boiling
sea
charged
freedom
heroes
true
for
the
battle
smoke
and
fury
waved
high
the
synonym
of
glory
the
old
red
white
and
blue
great
crashing
volleys
long
and
loud
swept
from
the
decks
the
spaniards
proud
then
wrapped
their
boats
in
a
smoky
shroud
and
left
them
beached
and
burning
their
decks
in
human
blood
were
laved
which
the
yellow
banner
waved
so
vauntingly
that
morning
that
eve
the
sunset
crimson
ray
touched
gently
softly
tenderly
the
waves
that
moaned
where
the
lost
fleet
lay
the
pride
of
spain
erstwhile
and
crowned

thou

hunted
for
till
i
late
for
school
an
mad
as
one
ol
march
hare
an
a
dozen
more
right
down
on
the
floor
i
find
that
hat
just
where
somebody
went
an
throwed
it
down
it
the
same
with
my
books
each
day
my
bat
an
ball
my
mittens
an
all
though
i
sure
i
put
away
but
i
tell
you
this
if
i
ever
find
who
that
meddlesome
somebody
is
i
rout
an
scout
an
all
that
about
i
learn
to
mind
his
biz
the
hero
of
life
song
we
sing
of
the
hero
of
battle
we
cherish
and
worship
his
name
of
the
hero
of
old
and
the
hero
of
gold
of
him
who
has
honor
and
fame
the
hero
of
love
tender
passion
who
basks
in
its
mystical
ray
as
we
journey
along
but
never
a
song
for
the
hero
we
meet
every
day
the
one
who
can
face
aye
so
bravely
his
losses
rebuffs
and
defeat
whose
heart
will
not
break
though
the
world
may
forsake
from
the
enemy
will
not
retreat
who
never
will
murmur
at
fate
when
it
seems
an
unmerciful
foe
but
struggles
along
with
a
heart
true
and
strong
and
strikes
a
far
nobler
blow
though
his
last
golden
castle
is
shattered
and
sown
to
the
wind
long
ago
each
one
that
he
meets
with
a
warm
smile
he
greets
his
burden
we
never
may
know
but
hark
sweetest
melodies
mingle
with
the
din
of
earth
tumult
and
strife
heaven
joyous
bells
ring
and
archangels
sing
for
the
hero
of
life
the
child
inquiry
oh
where
is
that
beautiful
city
mamma
the
one
that
is
called
fort
wayne
does
it
rest
in
the
light
of
a
clear
blue
sky
out
on
a
sandy
plain
or
may
it
be
found
where
the
roses
climb
over
trellises
built
so
high
that
if
you
would
pluck
off
the
topmost
one
you
have
to
climb
up
to
the
sky
or
where
all
the
streets
are
so
smooth
and
so
clean
that
buggies
and
bicycles
too
glide
along
with
all
ease
in
the
sweet
dreamy
breeze
like
balloons
in
soft
heavens
of
blue
mother
not
there
my
child
not
there
fort
wayne
is
a
hustling
city
my
dear
on
the
banks
of
the
old
maumee
where
most
of
the
folks
are
too
busy
to
care
the
beauties
of
nature
to
see
is
a
place
where
they
all
pay
a
tax
my
dear
for
repairing
the
street
you
know
that
they
all
may
enjoy
their
bicycles
dear
as
bumpety
bump
they
go
and
should
you
enter
that
city
my
dear
be
sure
that
you
always
look
down
or
first
thing
you
know
in
a
rut
you
will
go
and
find
yourself
flat
on
the
ground
or
if
is
not
you
that
is
flat
on
the
ground
your
bicycle
ruined
will
be
there
are
tacks
broken
strewn
all
around
and
your
tire
will
be
punctured
you
see
fort
wayne
is
the
city
of
tags
my
dear
as
every
taxpayer
knows
tags
on
their
horses
their
wheels
and
their
dogs
and
tags
from
their
heads
to
their
toes
when
its
people
go
into
the
country
my
dear
to
enjoy
its
cool
breezes
and
shade
they
are
bangled
and
spangled
with
tags
my
dear
till
they
look
like
a
circus
parade
it
is
there
my
child
it
is
there
to
the
old
town
clock
oh
servant
faithful
tried
and
true
through
sunshine
storm
and
shower
thy
face
for
nearly
forty
years
has
graced
the
tower
thy
hands
have
never
idle
hung
thy
face
was
always
cheery
thy
pendulum
seemed
never
never
weary
when
we
were
late
to
work
or
school
how
gently
didst
thou
chide
us
telling
in
soft
and
muffled
chimes
how
swiftly
time
glides
by
us
oh
how
the
workman
loved
thy
voice
when
thou
at
set
of
sun
proclaimed
in
softest
sweetest
chimes
that
his
day
work
was
done
but
to
us
all
it
lost
its
charm
and
sounded
cross
and
surly
when
wakened
by
its
loud
alarm
in
morning
oh
so
early
the
maple
trees
that
spread
their
boughs
the
yard
below
each
year
yield
up
their
foliage
to
winter
frost
and
snow
the
birds
that
nest
and
sing
among
their
boughs
in
summer
time
when
winter
winds
begin
to
blow
all
seek
a
sunny
clime
but
thou
oh
tried
and
faithful
one
wert
always
just
the
same
keeping
the
time
with
merry
chime
through
sunshine
snow
and
rain
for
forty
years
kept
the
time
while
in
the
court
below
stood
he
who
perpetrated
crime
waiting
his
doom
to
know
and
when
a
murderer
was
tried
who
for
a
little
pay
did
take
the
life
of
a
trusting
friend
in
a
hut
not
far
away
one
two
three
we
heard
thee
say
in
measured
tones
and
slow
as
forth
to
be
tried
in
courts
his
soul
did
go
oh
cruel
was
thy
fate
old
clock
for
many
days
ago
thy
old
familiar
face
was
crushed
by
workmen
sturdy
blow
they
say
they
build
a
new
and
that
they
will
replace
by
timepiece
handsome
bright
and
new
thy
old
face
then
thou
oh
servant
tried
and
true
through
storm
sunshine
and
the
music
of
thy
mellow
chimes
we
hear
again
no
more
afterwhile
somewhere
some
day
the
misty
shadow
that
covers
your
heaven
of
blue
will
melted
be
and
you
will
see
the
rainbow
gleaming
through
the
tears
you
shed
in
silence
for
love
that
was
wasted
here
be
still
o
soul
they
find
their
goal
afterwhile
somewhere
though
deeds
of
kindness
oft
bitter
reproaches
bring
as
the
drowning
bee
that
you
set
free
repays
you
with
a
sting
the
pain
you
bear
in
silence
for
confidence
wasted
here
will
blossoms
yield
in
a
field
afterwhile
somewhere
though
years
of
honest
labor
success
has
never
crowned
no
fruit
they
brought
though
nobly
wrought
dire
fate
has
always
frowned
the
seed
you
sown
with
patience
the
labor
you
wasted
here
again
will
bloom
in
the
afterwhile
somewhere
