the

your
notes
are
few
but
sweet
your
song
as
and
all
day
long
dear
bobolink
i
never
tire
to
hear
you
sing
the
bluebird
when
god
had
made
a
host
of
them
one
little
flower
still
lacked
a
stem
to
hold
its
blossom
blue
so
into
it
he
breathed
a
song
and
suddenly
with
petals
strong
as
wings
away
it
flew
the
woodpecker
the
wizard

woods
is

his

apology
to

you
of

my

sorely
grieves
nor

i
in

unless
you
grant
your

away

you

silk
was
the
shroud
of
many
a
thing
that
rose
from
its
tangled
skein

the
garb
of
many
a
king

went

the
take
heed
for
then
they
know
is
time
to
go
and
plant
the
wing√®d
seed
a
legacy
do
you
remember
little
cloud
this
morning
when
you
lay
a
mist
along
the
river
what
the
waters
had
to
say
and
how
the
flowers
that
on
the
margin
grew
all
promised
when
the
day
was
done
to
leave
their
tints
to
you
amid
the
roses
there
was
laughter
the
roses
for
it
was
their
natal
day
and
the
children
in
the
garden
were
as
light
of
heart
as
they
there
were
sighs
amid
the
roses
for
the
night
was
coming
on
and
the
children
weary
now
of
play
were
ready
to
be
gone
there
are
tears
amid
the
roses
for
the
children
are
asleep
and
the
silence
of
the
garden
makes
the
lonely
blossoms
weep
light
and
shadow
i
love
you
little
maid
said
the
sunbeam
to
the
shade
as
all
day
long
she
shrank
away
before
him
but
at
twilight
ere
he
died
she
was
weeping
at
his
side
and
he
felt
her
tresses
softly
trailing
him
sleep
when
he
is
a
little
chap
we
call
him
when
he
somewhat
older
grows
we
call
him
when
his
age
by
hours
we
number
we
call
him
the
are
you
flying
through
the
night
looking
where
to
find
me
nay
i
travel
with
a
light
for
the
folks
me
the
is
skimming
a
stagnant
pool
your
only
occupation
ah
no
is
at
this
summer
school
i
get
my
education
archery
a
bow
across
the
sky
another
in
the
river
whence
swallows
upward
fly
like
arrows
from
a
quiver
a
spy
sighed
the
languid
moon
to
the
morning
star
o
little
maid
how
late
you
are
i
could
rise
from
my
couch
quoth
she
while
the
was
looking
at
me
a
lament
o
lady
cloud
why
are
you
weeping
i
said
because
she
made
answer
my
is
dead
fern
song
dance
to
the
beat
of
the
rain
little
fern
and
spread
out
your
palms
again
and
say
tho
the
sun
hath
my
vesture
spun
he
had
laboured
alas
in
vain
but
for
the
shade
that
the
cloud
hath
made
and
the
gift
of
the
dew
and
the
rain
then
laugh
and
upturn
all
your
fronds
little
fern
and
rejoice
in
the
beat
of
the
rain
the
brook
it
is
the
mountain
to
the
sea
that
makes
a
messenger
of
me
and
lest
i
loiter
on
the
way
and
lose
what
i
am
sent
to
say
he
sets
his
reverie
to
song
and
bids
me
sing
it
all
day
long
farewell
for
here
the
stream
is
slow
and
i
have
many
a
mile
to
go
an
interview
i
sat
with
chill
december
beside
the
evening
fire
and
what
do
you
remember
i
ventured
to
inquire
of
seasons
long
forsaken
he
answered
in
amaze
my
age
you
have
mistaken
i
lived
but
thirty
baby
dimples
love
goes
playing
the
roses
on
her
cheek
with
a
little
imp
of
laughter
who
the
while
he
follows
after
leaves
the
footprints
that
we
trace
all
about
the
a
bunch
of
roses
the
rosy
mouth
and
rosy
toe
of
little
baby
brother
until
about
a
month
ago
had
never
met
each
other
but
nowadays
the
neighbours
sweet
in
every
sort
of
weather
half
way
with
rosy
fingers
meet
to
kiss
and
play
together
is
all
the
way
to
beyond
the
hill
that
baby
has
to
travel
down
to
see
the
soldiers
drill
one
two
three
four
five
a
captain
and
his
men
and
on
the
other
side
you
know
are
six
seven
eight
nine
ten
the
baby
star
the
star
that
watched
you
in
your
sleep
has
just
put
out
his
light
to
you
on
earth
he
said
is
here
in
heaven
but
tell
the
baby
when
he
wakes
to
watch
for
my
return
for
i
hang
out
my
lamp
again
when
his
begins
to
burn
lo
in
the
west
a
cloud
at
rest
a
babe
upon
its
mother
breast
is
sleeping
now
above
it
beams
a
star
that
seems
to
shed
the
light
of
holy
dreams
upon
its
brow
but
cloud
and
star
tho
nearer
far
they
seem
my
babe
more
distant
are
from
heaven
than
thou
an
idolater
the
baby
has
no
skies
but
mother
eyes
nor
any
god
above
but
mother
love
his
angel
sees
the
father
face
but
the
mother
full
of
grace
and
yet
the
heavenly
kingdom
is
of
such
as
this
the
babe
two
together
babe
and
year
at
the
midnight
chime
through
the
darkness
drifted
here
to
the
coast
of
time
two
together
babe
and
year
over
night
and
day
crossed
the
desert
winter
drear
to
the
land
of
may
on
together
babe
and
year
swift
to
summer
passed
rest
a
moment
brother
dear
said
the
babe
at
last
nay
but
onward
answered
year
we
must
farther
go
through
the
vale
of
autumn
sere
to
the
mount
of
snow
toiling
upward
babe
and
year
climbed
the
frozen
height
we
may
rest
together
here
brother
babe
then
together
babe
and
year
slept
but
ere
the
dawn
vanishing
i
know
not
where
brother
year
was
bicycles
tricycles
bicycles
tricycles
nay
to
shun
laughter
cycles
first
and
cycles
after
for
surely
the
buyer
deserves
but
the
worst
who
would
buy
cycles
failing
to
try

first
high
and
low
a
boot
and
a
shoe
and
a
slipper
lived
once
in
the
cobbler
row
but
the
boot
and
the
shoe
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
slipper
because
she
was
low
but
the
king
and
the
queen
and
their
daughter
on
the
cobbler
chanced
to
call
and
as
neither
the
boot
nor
the
shoe
would
suit
the
slipper
went
off
to
the
ball
doctor
with
wondrous
skill
he
works
until
to
suit
himself
he
makes
it
a
patent
pill
to
cure
or
kill

between

never
was

seen
nor
so
little
room
for
the
crew
the
i
wonder
how
the
can
feed
each
hungry
minute
and
see
that
every
one
of
them
gets
sixty
seconds
in
it
and
whether
when
she
goes
abroad
she
knows
which
ones
attend
her
for
all
of
them
are
just
alike
in
age
and
size
and
gender
take
pains
growled
the
tooth
to
the
dentist
the
same
said
the
dentist
to
you
then
he
added
no
doubt
before
you
are
out
you
have
taken
most
pains
of
the
two
a
rub
handkerchief
and
nose
a
difference
arose
and
a
tradition
goes
that
they
settled
it
by
blows
cats
they
fought
like
demons
of
the
night
beneath
a
shrunken
moon
and
all
the
roof
at
dawn
of

with

strewn
an
insectarian
i
can
not
wash
my
dog

said
nor
touch
him
with
a
comb
for
fear
the
fleas
upon
him
bred
may
find
no
other
home
the
squirrel
who
combs
you
little
squirrel
and
do
you
twist
and
twirl
when
some
one
puts
the
papers
on
to
keep
your
tail
in
curl
and
must
you
see
the
dentist
for
every
tooth
you
break
and
are
you
apt
from
eating
nuts
to
get
the
hospitality
said
a
snake
to
a
frog
with
a
wrinkled
skin
as
i
notice

that
your
dress
is
thin
and
a

papa
to

mamma
where
is
our
little
daughter
said
frog
mamma
to
frog
papa
she
underneath
the
water
then
down
the
anxious
father
went
and
there
indeed
he
found
her
tadpoles
till
they
kicked
their
tails
off
all
around
her
the
pedigree
our
great
ancestor
polly
wog
with
her
cousin
thaddeus
pole
eloped
from
her
home
in
an
irish
bog
and
crossing
the
sea
on
the
mayflower
log
at
the
risk
of
body
and
soul
married
a
frog

thus

said
the
parlour
to
the
fly
he
the
emptiest
little
spider
that
ever
you
did
spy
and
he
covers
me
with
cobweb
so
i
want
you
to
go
in
for
his
lower
chamber
furnished

will
have
no

i
ask
you
how
you
find
dear
lord
ii
lord
i
have
lost
a
toy
with
which
i
love
to
play
and
as
you
were
yourself
a
boy
of
just
my
age
o
son
of
mary
would
you
mind
to
help
me
now
my
toy
to
find
the
child
at
bethlehem
i
long
long
before
the
babe
could
speak
when
he
would
kiss
his
mother
cheek
and
to
her
bosom
press
the
brightest
angels
standing
near
would
turn
away
to
hide
a
tear
for
they
are
motherless
ii
where
were
ye
birds
that
bless
his
name
when
wingless
to
the
world
he
came
and
tho
himself
the
word
that
made
the
blossom
and
the
bird
iii
to
his
mother
he
brought
a
lily
white
that
bowed
its
fragrant
head
and
blushed
a
rosy
red
before
her
fairer
light
he
brought
a
rose
and
lo
the
crimson
blossom
saw
her
beauty
and
in
awe
became
as
white
as
snow
a
lily
of
the
field
in
all
his
glory
solomon
was
never
so
arrayed
yet
far
more
beautiful
is
one
a
mother
and
a
maid
whose
loveliness
and
lowliness
god
stooped
from
highest
heaven
to
bless
the
when
christ
the
babe
was
born
full
many
a
little
lamb
upon
the
wintry
hills
forlorn
was
nestled
near
its
dam
and
waking
or
asleep
upon
his
mother
breast
for
love
of
her
each
and
he
blessed
a
pair
of
the
purification
where
woman
is
thine
offering
the
debt
of
law
and
love
my
babe
a
tender
nestling
is
and
i
the
you
hid
your
little
self
dear
lord
as
other
children
do
but
oh
how
great
was
their
reward
who
sought
three
days
for
you
out
of
bounds
a
little
boy
of
heavenly
birth
but
far
from
home
comes
down
to
find
his
ball
the
earth
that
sin
has
cast
away
o
comrades
let
us
one
and
all
join
in
to
get
him
back
his
ball
the
child
on
calvary
the
cross
is
tall
and
i
too
small
to
reach
his
hand
or
touch
his
feet
but
on
the
sand
his
footprints
i
have
found
and
it
is
sweet
to
kiss
the
holy
ground
the
child
at
nazareth
i
once
measuring
his
height
he
stood
beneath
a
and
leaning
back
against
the
wood
stretched
wide
his
arms
for
me
whereat
a
brooding
fled
fluttering
from
her
nest
above
ii
at
evening
he
loved
to
walk
among
the
shadowy
hills
and
talk
of
bethlehem
but
if
perchance
there
passed
us
by
the
paschal
lambs
he
look
at
them
in
silence
long
and
tenderly
and
when
again
he
try
to
speak
i
seen
the
tears
upon
his
cheek
theresa
and
the
child
who
art
thou
son
the
little
stranger
smiled
and
who
art
whereto
she
made
reply
theresa
i
of
jesus
am
my
child

radiant
jesus
of
theresa

when
home
our
blessed
lord
was
gone

mother
lived
alone
with
john

each
had
secrets
to
impart
that
love
had
taught
