thy

whose

set

and
here
here
garner
up
thy
like
to
him
now
are

fathers
of

mourning
the
crippled
world
the
bitter
whose
striplings
are
no

the
crippled

come
then
fathers
of
women
with
your
honour
in
trust
approve
accept
know
them
daughters
of
men
now
that
your
sons
are
dust
length
of
days
to
the
early
dead
in
battle
there
is
no
length
of
days
but
yours
boys
who
were
children
once
of
old
the
past
beset
you
in
your
childish
ways
with
sense
of
time
untold
what
have
you
then
forgone
a
history
this
you
had
or
memories
these
too
you
had
of
your
dawn
no
further
dawn
seems
his
the
old
man
who
shares
with
you
but
has
no
more
no
more
mystery
did
once
for
him
the
most
that
it
can
do
he
has
had
infancy
and
all
his
dreams
and
all
his
loves
for
mighty
nature
sweet
and
few
are
but
the
dwindling
past
he
can
recall
of
what
his
childhood
knew
he
counts
not
any
more
his
brief
his
present
years
but
o
he
knows
how
far
apart
the
summers
were
of
yore
how
far
apart
the
snows
therefore
be
satisfied
long
life
is
in
your
treasury
ere
you
fall
yes
and
first
love
like
o
a
bride
for
ever
mystical
irrevocable
good
you
dead
and
now
about
so
young
to
die
your
childhood
was

nurse
edith
cavell
two
the
morning
of
october
to
her
accustomed
eyes
the
brought
not
such
a
dread
as
thrills
the
head
that
lies
in
trivial
sleep
on
the
habitual
bed
yet
some
hours
ere
light
and
many
many
many
a
break
of
day
had
she
outwatched
the
dying
but
this
night
shortened
her
vigil
was
briefer
the
way
by
dial
of
the
clock
day
in
the
dark
above
her
lonely
head
day
thou
shalt
be
with
ere
the
cock
announced
that
day
she
met
the
immortal
dead
summer
in
england
on
london
fell
a
clearer
light
caressing
pencils
of
the
sun
defined
the
distances
the
white
houses
transfigured
one
by
one
the
unlovely
impearled
o
what
a
sky
has
walked
the
world
most
happy
year
and
out
of
town
the
hay
was
prosperous
and
the
wheat
the
silken
harvest
climbed
the
down
moon
after
moon
was
stroking
the
bread
within
the
sheaves
looking
twixt
apples
and
their
leaves
and
while
this
rose
made
round
her
cup
the
armies
died
convulsed
and
when
this
chaste
young
silver
sun
went
up
softly
a
thousand
shattered
men
one
wet
corruption
heaped
the
plain
after
a
throb
of
pain
flower
following
tender
flower
and
birds
and
berries
and
benignant
skies
made
thrive
the
serried
flocks
and
yonder
are
men
shot
through
the
eyes
love
hide
thy
face
from
unpardonable
race
who
said
man
hath
greater
love
than
this
to
die
to
serve
his
friend
so
these
have
loved
us
all
unto
the
end
chide
thou
no
more

thou
unsacrificed

the

between
himself
and
a
full

to
be
known
in

by
the
splendid
trick
of
an
occluded
sun
and
a
shadow
thrown
straight
at

two
of
the
greatest
of
his
multitude
of
works

thy
enterprise
magnificent
magnanimous
was
well
done
which
seized
the

turned

had
she
sat
content
her
young

back
to
a
morning
gay
to
a
solemn
noon
to
a
cloudy
firmament
and
looked
upon
a
world
in
gentle
day
but
thy
imperial
call
bade
her
to
stand
with
thee
and
breast
the
light
and
therefore
face

shadows
mystical
sombre
translucent
vestiges

thee
by
thy
undaunted

and
by
thy
glooms
we
blow
thy
way
ambiguous
and
those
dyes
thou
cloud
the
friend
the
bridegroom
sun
master
we
know
thy
sign
a
mystery
of
hues
and
of
gamesome
and
divine
shade

o

thou

stand
a
thrush
before
dawn
a
voice
peals
in
this
end
of
night
a
phrase
of
notes
resembling
stars
single
and
spiritual
notes
of
light
what
call
they
at
my
the
south
the
past
the
day
to
be
an
ancient
infelicity
darkling
deliberate
what
sings
this
wonderful
one
alone
at
peace
what
wilder
things
than
song
what
things
sweeter
than
youth
clearer
than
greece
dearer
than
italy
untold
delight
and
freshness
centuries
old
and
first
a
multitude
the
exaltation
of
their
pain
ancestral
childhood
long
renewed
and
midnights
of
invisible
rain
and
gardens
gardens
night
and
day
gardens
and
childhood
all
the
way
what
middle
ages
passionate
o
passionless
voice
what
distant
bells
lodged
in
the
hills
what
palace
state
illyrian
for
it
speaks
it
tells
without
desire
without
dismay
some
morrow
and
some
yesterday
things
but
came
this
yet
remoter
mystery
how
do
these
starry
notes
proclaim
a
graver
still
divinity
this
hope
this
sanctity
of
fear
innocent
human
the
two
shakespeare
tercentenaries
of
birth
of
death
to
shakespeare
longer
than
thine
than
thine
is
now
my
time
of
life
and
thus
thy
years
seem
to
be
clasped
and
harboured
within
mine
o
how
ignoble
this
my
clasp
appears
thy
unprophetic
birth
thy
darkling
death
living
i
might
have
seen
that
cradle
marked
those
labours
closed
that
earth
o
first
o
last
o
infinite
between
now
that
my
life
has
shared
thy
dedicated
date
o
mortal
twice
to
what
embrace
shall
be
compared
my
lean
enclosure
of
thy
paradise
to
ignorant
arms
that
fold
a
poet
to
a
foolish
breast
the
line
that
is
not
with
the
world
within
its
hold
so
days
with
days
my
days
encompass
thine
child
stripling
sod
might
i
talk
little
language
to
thee
pore
on
thy
last
silence
o
thou
city
of
god
my
waste
lies
after
thee
and
lies
before
to
of
her
dark
eyes
across
what
calm
of
tropic
seas
alien
clusters
of
the
nights
looked
in
the
past
such
eyes
as
these
relumed
ancestral
lights
the
generations
fostered
them
and
steadfast
nature
thou
seedling
child
of
that
old
kindled
anew
thy
eyes
was
it
a
century
or
two
this
lovely
darkness
rose
and
set
occluded
by
grey
eyes
and
blue
and
nature
feigning
to
forget
some
grandam
gave
a
hint
of
so
cherished
was
it
in
thy
race
so
fine
a
treasure
to
transmit
in
its
perfection
to
thy
face
some
father
to
some
breast
entrusted
it
unknowing
time
implied
or
made
it
manifest
bequest
of
a
forgotten
clime
hereditary
eyes
but
this
is
single
singular
apart
thy
love
thy
kiss
thy
errand
to
my
heart
the
treasure
three
times
have
i
beheld
fear
leap
in
a
face
and
take
his
breath
fear
like
the
fear
of
eld
that
knows
the
price
of
life
the
name
of
death
what
is
it
justifies
this
thing
this
dread
this
fright
that
has
no
tongue
the
terror
in
those
eyes
when
only
eyes
can
are
so
young
not
yet
those
eyes
had
wept
what
does
fear
cherish
that
it
locks
so
well
what
fortress
is
thus
kept
of
what
is
ignorant
terror
sentinel
and
pain
in
the
poor
child
monstrously
disproportionate
and
dumb
in
the
poor
beast
and
wild
in
the
old
decorous
man
caught
overcome
of
what
the
outposts
these
of
what
the
fighting
guardians
what
demands
that
sense
of
menaces
and
then
such
flying
feet
imploring
hands
life
nought
else
to
seek
life
only
little
prized
but
by
design
of
nature
prized
how
weak
how
sad
how
brief
o
how
divine
divine
a
wind
of
clear
weather
in
england
o
what
a
miracle
wind
is
this
has
crossed
the
english
land
with
an
unprecedented
kiss
and
wonderfully
found
a
way
unsmirched
incredibly
and
clean
between
the
towns
and
factories
avoiding
has
his
long
flight
been
bringing
a
sky
like
o
fine
escape
horizon
pure
as
black
chimneys
left
and
right
but
not
for
him
the
straight
the
sure
his
luminous
day
his
spacious
night
how
keen
his
choice
how
swift
his
feet
narrow
the
way
and
hard
to
find
this
delicate
stepper
and
discreet
walked
not
like
any
worldly
wind
most
like
a
man
in
own
day
one
of
the
few
a
perfect
one
his
open
single
way
his
narrow
open
sun
in
sleep
i
dreamt
no
dream
indeed
a
wrathful
man
was
talking
in
the
park
are
the
higher
powers
who
know
our
need
and
leave
us
in
the
dark
are
no
higher
powers
there
is
no
heart
in
god
no
oratory
here
taking
the
and
the
part
was
broken
by
a
tear
and
then
it
seemed
that
one
who
did
create
compassion
who
alone
invented
pity
walked
as
though
called
in
at
that
gate
out
from
the
muttering
city
threaded
the
little
crowd
trod
the
brown
grass
bent
the
speaker
close
saw
the
tear
rise
and
saw
himself
as
one
looks
in
a
glass
in
those
impassioned
eyes
the
divine
privilege
lord
where
are
thy
prerogatives
why
men
have
more
than
thou
hast
kept
the
king
rewards
remits
forgives
the
poet
to
a
throne
has
stept
and
thou
despoiled
hast
given
away
worship
to
men
success
to
strife
thy
glory
to
the
heavenly
day
and
made
thy
sun
the
lord
of
life
is
one
too
precious
to
impart
one
property
reserved
to
christ
one
cherished
grappled
to
that
heart
be
alone
the
sacrificed
o
thou
who
lovest
to
redeem
one
whom
i
know
lies
sore
oppressed
thou
wilt
not
suffer
me
to
dream
that
i
can
bargain
for
her
rest
seven
hours
i
swiftly
sleep
while
she
measures
the
leagues
of
dark
awake
o
that
my
dewy
eyes
might
be
parched
by
a
vigil
for
her
sake
but
o
rejected
o
in
vain
i
can
not
give
who
would
not
keep
i
can
not
buy
i
can
not
gain
i
can
not
give
her
half
my
sleep
free
will
dear
are
some
hidden
things
my
soul
has
sealed
in
silence
past
delights
hope
unconfessed
desires
with
hampered
wings
remembered
in
the
nights
but
my
best
treasures
are
ignoble
undelightful
abject
cold
yet
o
profounder
hoards
oracular
no
reliquaries
hold
there
lie
my
trespasses
abjured
but
not
disowned
not
accuse
determinism
nor
as
the
master
says
charge
even
poor
under
my
hand
they
lie
my
very
own
my
proved
iniquities
and
though
the
glory
of
my
life
go
by
i
hold
and
garner
these
how
else
how
otherwhere
how
otherwise
shall
i
discern
and
grope
for
lowliness
how
hate
how
love
how
dare
how
weep
how
hope
the
two
questions
riddling
world
one
cried
pangs
must
be
would
god
that
they
were
sent
to
the
impure
the
cruel
and
passed
aside
the
holy
innocent
but
i
no
no
no
not
the
clean
heart
transpierced
not
tears
that
fall
for
a
agony
not
a
woe
not
these
not
these
appal
docile
motherhood
dutiful
frequent
closed
in
all
distress
not
shedding
of
the
unoffending
blood
not
little
joy
grown
less
old
age
with
dotage
mocked
not
gallantry
that
faints
and
still
pursues
not
the
vile
heritage
of
disease
in
saints
these
defeat
the
mind
for
great
is
that
abjection
and
august
that
irony
submissive
we
shall
find
a
splendour
in
that
dust

puzzle

unanswered
question

but
the
unjust
stricken
but

lopped
but
the
merited
scourge
sensualist
at
fast
the
merciless
felled
the
liar
in
his
snares
the
cowardice
of
my
judgment

aghast
the
flail

chaff

prayer

mass
