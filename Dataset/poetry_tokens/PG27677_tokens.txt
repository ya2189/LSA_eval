daisy

part
thro
scented
meadows
where
do
graze
the
kine
on
summer
days
at
early
morn
swept
daisy
dare
sparkling
graceful
passing
fair
sparkling
as
the
gleaming
on
her
path
or
sunlight
streaming
through
her
tresses
graceful
fair
as
naught
on
earth
save
daisy
dare
wondrous
tresses
sunshine
fades
mid
floating
curls
and
sumptuous
braids
a
crown
of
light
that
glorifies
white
brow
and
deep
impassioned
eyes
full
perfect
tempting
were
her
lips
the
bee
or
that
sips
from
scarlet
blossoms
in
the
south
beguiled
might
be
by
such
a
mouth
her
path
ran
by
a
rushing
stream
which
like
a
crooked
silver
seam
bound
that
green
meadow
to
a
wood
where
soon
with
graham
lee
she
stood
softly
through
arching
came
stealing
up
a
fresh
salt
breeze
one
fair
cheek
kissing
till
it
burned
like
to
the
other
turned
daisy
he
said
i
sail
for
india
with
captain
gray
will
you
not
be
upon
the
strand
to
say
to
wave
your
hand
yes
i
will
go
to
see
you
sail
the
tone
was
proud
her
cheek
turned
pale
i
promised
to
be
there
and
say
a
parting
word
to
allen
gray
the
strong
man
cheek
grew
white
as
death
as
thus
with
short
unsteady
breath
he
said
when
last
i
went
to
sea
you
waved
nay
kissed
your
hand
to
me
her
eyes
flashed
smiling
on
him
then
such
eyes
hold
fiery
earnest
men
in
bondage
and
to
love
beguile
whether
they
mock
or
weep
or
smile
yes
i
remember
then
to
you
i
kissed
my
hand
but
here
are
two
can
i
not
still
kiss
this
one
pray
to
you
and
this
to
allen
gray
illustration
oh
do
not
mock
me
daisy
dare
with
your
small
hands
so
soft
and
fair
her
voice
was
deep
the
words
were
light
the
hands
upheld
were
small
and
white
such
hands
as
strong
men
love
to
grasp
and
crush
in
an
impassioned
clasp
oh
do
not
mock
me
daisy
dare
with
your
small
hands
so
soft
and
fair
they
may
beguile
both
lovers
true
you
can
not
give
your
heart
to
two
one
or
the
other
let
it
be
if
allen
gray
you
lost
to
me
if
me
all
hearts
you
must
resign
all
homage
and
all
love
save
mine
my
guiding
star
across
the
brine
has
been
the
hope
that
called
you
mine
i
rather
see
that
set
than
wed
a
fair
false
vain
coquette
i
rather
trust
though
seas
divide
than
linger
doubting
by
your
side
now
speak
what
turns
your
heart
away
the
love
of
gold
or
allen
gray
up
rose
her
spirit
quick
and
proud
and
as
through
a
translucent
cloud
pour
crimson
streams
of
torrid
light
the
red
blood
dyed
her
forehead
white
i
have
not
broken
faith
or
vow
she
said
but
do
release
you
now
my
heart
can
not
be
bought
or
sold
by
allen
gray
with
love
or
gold
i
trifled
with
him
but
to
try
your
faith
in
me
i
rather
die
than
wed
a
man
of
jealous
heart
you
can
not
trust
me
let
us
part
the
jealous
love
you
bring
to
me
as
yonder
green
impulsive
sea
unto
the
shore
doth
come
and
go
in
passion
tides
would
ebb
and
flow
and
as
that
surf
in
fitful
swells
doth
bring
or
bear
away
the
shells
from
yonder
strand
such
passion
strife
would
fill
or
desolate
my
life
such
earthly
crown
of
love
to
wear
the
cross
it
brings
i
would
not
bear
here
see
me
cast
the
burden
down
go
for
i
yield
you
up
the
crown
the
angry
flush
had
faded
now
leaving
her
bosom
cheek
and
brow
whiter
than
the
moon
her
low
voice
as
sad
tune
she
waved
her
hand
and
turned
away
he
caught
it
crying
daisy
stay
let
not
a
flash
of
two
clinging
hearts
like
ours
divide
she
stood
before
him
haughty
cold
you
taunted
me
with
love
of
gold
who
wealth
and
titles
scorned
to
be
the
chosen
bride
of
graham
lee
this
choice
perhaps
you
now
regret
and
crave
a
titled
suitor
yet
hearts
that
are
anchored
side
by
side
no
can
divide
his
words
were
bitter
in
their
turn
and
like
sharp
acid
on
a
burn
they
scorched
her
heart
and
seared
the
spot
where
blossomed
love
oh
why
are
darts
of
anger
hurled
from
heart
to
heart
throughout
the
world
fierce
as
the
lightning
flashing
far
from
cloud
to
cloud
its
bar
so
quick
so
sharp
too
oft
it
cleaves
the
of
love
and
leaves
but
fragrant
broken
links
at
last
to
bind
us
to
a
ruined
past
too
often
fixing
deeps
of
woe
between
us
and
the
long
ago
bridging
a
gulf
toward
green
with
one
regret
it
might
have
been
oh
why
when
life
is
in
its
june
of
fruity
fragrance
perfect
tune
does
passion
stormy
pride
destroy
youths
heritage
of
love
and
joy
one
jealous
breath
will
oft
disclose
a
canker
in
hope
perfect
rose
for
the
false
fever
heat
of
strife
to
nurse
and
nourish
into
life
oh
daisy
dare
the
sea
is
wide
dear
is
the
lover
by
thy
side
the
sea
is
treacherous
hungry
deep
and
millions
its
treasures
weep
his
heart
relented
strong
hearts
do
yet
more
relenting
oft
less
true
than
those
unyielding
that
defy
the
deathless
love
of
which
they
die
as
forest
saplings
by
the
sun
together
knit
till
two
are
one
one
trunk
one
bark
one
sap
one
tree
our
hearts
have
been
should
ever
be
let
sharp
steel
cleave
that
circling
rind
no
art
its
severed
strength
could
bind
should
anger
part
thy
love
from
mine
holds
earth
another
heart
for
thine
oh
stubborn
pride
unyielding
still
her
heart
is
conquered
but
her
will
defies
its
tender
pleading
tone
she
left
him
they
were
both
alone
when
eve
her
golden
goblet
fills
among
the
sunset
purple
hills
and
overflows
that
sunset
wine
in
streams
of
glory
on
the
brine
unto
the
shore
a
maiden
came
who
gazed
where
down
that
track
of
flame
a
steamer
to
the
west
did
dip
her
heart
went
outward
with
the
ship
she
had
not
kept
her
tryst
that
day
nor
waved
her
hand
to
allen
gray
both
little
hands
were
still
was
true
she
could
not
give
her
heart
to
two
she
heard
the
parting
signals
sound
and
then
the
haughty
pride
that
bound
her
woman
heart
which
had
defied
her
woman
love
grew
faint
and
died
illustration
she
wandered
hopeless
to
the
strand
and
hopeless
westward
waved
her
hand
she
heard
the
steamship
iron
bell
turned
to
the
shore
but
faltered
fell
for
ocean
steamers
do
not
wait
on
love
her
pride
gave
way
too
late
too
late
she
heard
it
rise
and
swell
tolled
by
the
iron
steamer
bell
told
by
the
mocking
voice
of
fate
rung
through
her
heart
too
late
too
late
and
now
when
from
that
outward
bound
defiant
distance
brought
no
sound
she
wandered
hopeless
to
the
strand
and
hopeless
westward
waved
her
hand
the
steamer
black
smoke
drifting
far
rose
up
and
hid
the
evening
star
a
bitter
symbol
of
that
strife
between
love
and
her
life
in
the
late
gloaming
purple
gloom
she
wandered
home
but
half
the
bloom
had
faded
from
her
cheek
and
lips
love
orient
was
in
eclipse
the
ship
went
down
such
message
crossed
the
lightning
wire
and
all
were
lost
save
captain
gray
and
two
or
three
among
them
was
not
graham
lee
from
daisy
hand
the
paper
fell
no
cry
she
uttered
but
a
swell
of
anguish
through
her
heart
did
sweep
bearing
it
downward
to
the
deep
as
the
green
pallor
of
a
storm
a
summer
landscape
doth
deform
making
a
livid
shadow
grow
athwart
the
ruddy
glow
across
the
future
once
so
fair
so
ripe

in
sorrow
set
as
gleams
from

edged
with
jet
some
months
had
passed
it
was
not
long
when
daisy
stood
amid
a
throng
turning
her
white
cheek
from
the
light
clasping
her
small
hands
fiercely
tight
for
she
had
heard
two
brave
men
say
a
stranger
one
one
allen
gray
no
braver
hero
ever
died
than
he
whose
love
she
lost
through
pride
unselfish
earnest
daring
brave
all
but
himself
he
tried
to
save
heedless
of
death
and
danger
why
one
heart
alone
could
make
reply
one
spirit
that
had
vainly
sought
rest
from
a
hungry
surge
of
thought
fierce
retribution
thus
to
be
tortured
by
praise
of
graham
lee
hero
but
not
for
her
to
claim
there
was
the
anguish
there
the
shame
how
little
yielding
have
cost
to
call
him
still
her
own
though
lost
but
she
had
cast
away
the
right
and
mutely
wretched
heard
that
night
with
stormy
heart
and
tearless
cheek
his
praise
whose
name
she
dared
not
speak
few
knew
that
they
were
lovers
none
that
their
two
hearts
had
pulsed
as
one
so
the
world
called
her
cold
and
changed
friends
thought
her
haughty
and
estranged
the
current
of
her
life
ran
chill
beneath
a
crust
of
rime
and
lovers
wore
for
daisy
sake
the
icy
chains
they
could
not
break
a
yearning
sadness
in
her
face
but
added
to
that
nameless
grace
that
spell
by
which
some
women
reign
in
hearts
they
never
strove
to
gain
love
fell
on
her
superb
repose
like
warm
light
on
a
sculptured
rose
as
if
beguiled
to
flush
apart
the
chiselled
whiteness
of
its
heart
the
voice
of
passion
to
her
soul
swept
as
the
surges
roll
up
toward
a
beacon
steep
dashed
backward
rayless
to
the
deep
as
lighting
up
a
maze
of
cobwebs
with
its
dying
blaze
held
by
a
grim
black
spider
fast
flashing
with
glory
to
the
last
thus
tangled
in
a
cruel
fate
dared
through
her
folly
feared
too
late
the
light
of
daisy
lost
love
made
the
past
fall
back
in
deepest
shade
strong
natures
suffer
more
than
those
who
bowing
down
parade
their
woes
for
a
brief
season
and
then
rise
the
brave
heart
uncomplaining
dies
so
after
years
that
inner
gloom
had
only
softened
daisy
bloom
giving
such
meaning
to
her
eyes
as
worldlings
can
not
analyze
and
when
her
pink
cheek
turned
too
soon
pale
as
magnolia
buds
in
june
no
one
could
call
its
fairness
blight
or
wish
a
flush
upon
the
white
when
just
one
shade
of
roundness
passed
from
her
proud
form
they
said
at
last
that
she
must
travel
well
she
knew
love
and
regret
would
travel
too
was
not
one
shore
alone
whose
surge
came
wailing
to
her
like
a
dirge
the
surf
the
waves
of
every
sea
everywhere
moaned
of
graham
lee
and
when
in
a
far
distant
land
upon
a
sunny
southern
strand
where
warm
waves
green
as
malachite
come
leaping
as
from
vats
of
light
where
summer
sumptuous
golden
blaze
wraps
earth
in
a
voluptuous
haze
of
lambent
splendor
where
the
skies
drop
balm
as
erst
in
paradise
where
clusters
of
imperial
trees
nod
their
green
plumes
slumberous
seas
warm
amorous
deeps
whose
crystal
calms
dream
of
the
palms
a
shore
of
bloom
a
sea
so
bright
entranced
they
mingle
in
the
light
apart
yet
wedded
by
the
sun
as
severed
hearts
through
love
made
one
where
air
as
an
elixir
fine
exhilarates
like
sparkling
wine
where
mere
existence
brings
a
joy
life
trifling
ills
can
not
destroy
there
where
the
aromatic
breeze
fledged
in
a
nest
of
kissing
the
waves
made
sweet
the
swept
to
daisy
feet
the
gloom
the
shadow
passed
not
by
still
white
her
cheek
as
shells
that
lie
like
drifted
snow
on
golden
strand
where
stood
she
writing
in
the
sand
and
still
the
envious
surges
came
to
wash
away
that
precious
name
writ
on
her
heart
warm
shore
for
years
merged
by
its
tidal
flow
of
tears
she
stood
in
a
sequestered
cove
while
countless
memories
of
love
heaped
treasure
till
her
sea
of
grief
blushed
breaking
on
a
for
precious
memories
often
grow
from
out
the
darkest
voids
of
woe
as
fissures
by
the
drilled
in
eastern
shells
with
pearls
are
filled
the
creeping
tide
swells
shot
with
flame
stole
up
and
kissed
away
that
name
which
fate
indeed
with
mocking
hand
for
her
had
written
in
the
sand
outward
upon
her
right
did
reach
a
long
white
narrow
line
of
beach
where
careless
groups
now
idly
strayed
watching
the
flush
of
sunset
fade
and
when
across
that
crimson
glow
her
gaze
went
out
as
long
ago
colder
seas
unto
a
ship
which
toward
the
setting
sun
did
dip
on
the
far
point
of
that
white
sand
standing
together
hand
in
hand
like
forms
of
sculptured
bronze
revealed
against
the
sunset
burnished
shield
two
figures
smote
her
sight
and
left
two
blots
upon
the
light
darker
than
iron
ship
afar
or
smoke
that
hid
the
evening
star
for
there
between
her
and
the
sun
stood
graham
lee
and
with
him
one
whose
beauty
stirred
to
bitter
strife
the
chilly
current
of
her
life
illustration
two
figures
smote
her
sight
and
left
two
blots
upon
the
light
as
summer
sends
a
mighty
thrill
through
icy
floes
until
their
breaks
the
ghastly
sleep
of
nova
zembla
pallid
deep
more
dead
he
seemed
to
her
that
hour
there
in
the
strength
of
manly
power
bending
to
see
those
dark
eyes
shine
than
cold
and
still
beneath
the
brine
six
years
had
marked
their
weary
length
on
her
young
life
whose
faith
and
strength
a
widowed
heart
left
purified
to
live
now
wishing
she
had
died
more
lost
she
felt
and
more
alone
leaning
against
that
hard
cold
stone
than
when
his
ship
was
outward
bound
or
when
she
thought
of
him
as
drowned
they
turned
and
sauntered
towards
the
cove
oh
woman
strength
oh
woman
love
she
stirred
not
till
their
eyes
had
met
and
knew
herself
remembered
yet
down
wastes
of
absence
grief
and
gloom
warmed
by
his
gaze
uprose
the
bloom
of
hope
lost
violets
through
the
snow
a
purple
path
to
long
ago
she
saw
the
creole
large
dark
eyes
glance
up
to
his
in
mute
surprise
she
saw
him
leave
the
girl
and
stand
before
her
with
an
outstretched
hand
then
turned
and
fled
no
matter
where
so
those
she
fled
from
were
not
there
seaward
away
across
the
strand
where
hungry
waves
crept
up
the
sand
on
memory
scroll
there
came
a
blot
a
space
of
time
remembered
not
when
sense
awoke
clouds
late
aglow
with
sunset
fire
looked
drifts
of
snow
for
like
a
disembodied
soul
by
angels
clad
in
silvery
stole
and
shining
sandals
for
its
flight
along
the
upward
paths
of
light
the
moon
had
risen
there
and
turned
volcanic
while
they
burned
white
as
the
frozen
coronet
on
jura
misty
forehead
set
and
where
from
out
her
casket
fine
eve
had
dropped
rubies
on
the
brine
in
gleaming
lengths
of
shimmering
sheen
long
lines
of
moonlight
paved
the
green
yet
not
to
star
or
sea
or
skies
she
gazed
but
into
deep
dear
eyes
bending
upon
her
with
the
glow
the
old
sweet
love
of
long
ago
subtly
it
thrilled
through
every
vein
making
her
white
cheek
flush
again
as
pale

she
felt
love
subtle
potent
charm
binding
her
on
that
strong
right
arm
was
softer
than
the
cold
gray
stone
was
sweeter
thus
than
all
alone
one
moment
struggling
to
be
free
she
cried
release
me
graham

there
is
more
to

us
now

death

vow
daisy
his
voice
was
deep
and
clear
stay
would
i
dare
to
hold
you
here
so
near
my
heart
if
unto
you
that
heart
had
ever
been
untrue
perchance
had
i
not
found
you
soon
as
yon
gray
cloud
beside
the
moon
is
that
wore
a
crown
of
glory
when
the
sun
went
down
my
future
might
have
worn
at
last
a
light
which
likened
to
the
past
would
be
as
yonder
placid
moon
unto
the
sumptuous
suns
of
june
you
thought
me
dead
i
thought
you
lost
our
hearts
have
both
been
tempest
tossed
and
never
anchored
since
that
hour
when
each
defied
the
other
power
the
stately
creole
by
my
side
is
my
young
sister
not
my
bride
earth
holds
one
mate
alone
for
me
one
bride
say

shall
it
be
no

no

came
up

the
silent

no
answer
came
to
graham

what
need
of

from

how
quick
the
magnet
glances
fly
electric
sparks
from
soul
to
soul
as
magnets
flash
from
pole
to
pole
from
noiseless
waters
stealing
slow
the
drooping
white
stalactites
grow
from
noiseless
drops
stalagmites
rise
silent
they
meet
and
crystallize
the
overflowing
loves
that
spring
from
two
proud
natures
meeting
cling
in
strong
pure
bliss
from
heart
to
home
as
cavern

baby
power
six
little
feet
to
cover
six
little
hands
to
fill
tumbling
out
in
the
clover
stumbling
over
the
sill
six
little
stockings
ripping
six
little
shoes
half
worn
spite
of
the
promised
whipping
skirts
shirts
and
aprons
torn
bugs
and
catching
heedless
of
bites
and
stings
walls
and
furniture
scratching
twisting
off
buttons
and
strings
into
the
sugar
and
flour
into
the
salt
and
meal
their
royal
baby
power
all
through
the
house
we
feel
behind
the
big
stove
creeping
to
steal
the
into
the
cupboard
peeping
to
hunt
for
somesin
dood
the
dogs
they
tease
to
snarling
the
chickens
know
no
rest
yet
the
old
cook
calls
them
darling
and
loves
each
one
the
best
smearing
each
other
faces
with
smut
or
to
forbidden
things
and
places
always
making
a
rush
over
a
chair
or
table
they
fight
and
kiss
again
when
told
of
slaughtered
abel
or
cruel
wicked
cain
all
sorts
of
mischief
trying
on
sunny
days
in
doors
and
then
perversely
crying
to
rush
out
when
it
pours
a
raid
on
grandma
making
in
spite
her
nice
new
cap
its
strings
for
bridles
taking
while
riding
on
her
lap
three
mouths
beguiling
prattling
the
day
six
sweet
eyes
on
me
smiling
hazel
and
blue
and
hazel
with
sparkling
too
happy
we
trust
to
fade
blue
long
lashes
darkling
like
violets
in
the
shade
gray
full
of
earnest
meaning
a
dawning
light
so
fair
of
woman
life
beginning
we
dread
the
glare
of
earthly
strife
and
passion
may
spoil
its
tender
glow
change
its
celestial
fashion
as
change
the
snow
six
little
clasped
hands
lifted
three
white
brows
upward
turned
one
prayer
thrice
heavenward
drifted
to
him
who
never
spurned
the
lisp
of
lips
where
laughter
fading
away
in
prayer
leaves
holy
twilight
after
a
noon
of
gladness
there
three
little
heads
all
sunny
to
pillow
and
bless
at
night
riotous
alick
and
dunnie
jinnie
so
bonnie
and
bright
three
souls
immortal
slumber
crowned
by
that
golden
hair
when
christ
his
flock
shall
number
will
all
lambs
be
there
now
with
the
stillness
round
me
i
bow
my
head
and
pray
since
this
faint
heart
has
found
thee
suffer
them
not
to
stray
up
to
the
shining
portals
over
life
stormy
tide
treasures
i
bring
immortal
saviour
be
thou
my
guide
