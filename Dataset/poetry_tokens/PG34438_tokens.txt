the
troubles
of
biddy
oh
dear
sighed
old
biddy
just
under
her
breath
i
really
am
troubled
and
worried
to
death
for
months
i
have
thought
of
a
family
dear
to
gladden
my
heart
and
to
live
with
me
here
but
daily
i
find
that
my
plans
are
upset
and
all
i
can
do
is
to
sit
here
and
fret
i
have
a
sign
of
an
egg
in
my
nest
though
some
i
have
laid
are
as
good
as
the
best
i
scolded
last
night
when
my
mistress
came
near
but
though
she
was
bitten
she
seemed
not
to
fear
she
only
said
what
are
you
about
and
then
through
the
doorway
she
simply
passed
out
illustration

gathering
eggs
i
do
understand
it
i
can
not
see
why
for
surely
to
be
a
good
mother
i
try
although
i
would
see
that
they
did
as
i
said
and
biddy
in
sorrow
and
grief
hung
her
head
illustration

with
eggs
next
to
nest
illustration
girl
placing
eggs
in
nest
so
deep
was
the
longing
of
poor
biddy
heart
she
felt
that
with
life
she
was
ready
to
part
but
glancing
about
in
her
trouble
and
pain
she
saw
that
her
mistress
was
coming
again
and
noting
the
basket
she
held
in
her
hand
old
biddy
thought
quickly
she
ca
understand
and
what
is
she
doing
exclaimed
in
surprise
for
out
of
the
nest
biddy
felt
herself
rise
as
biddy
stood
resting
her
poor
weary
legs
she
saw
that
the
basket
contained
shining
eggs
and
mistress
with
care
placed
them
all
in
the
nest
for
biddy
to
snuggle
beneath
her
warm
breast
now
biddy
was
happy
her
burden
was
gone
her
troubles
had
vanished
she
felt
she
had
none
and
planning
away
in
her
little
straw
bed
no
thoughts
of
complaining
came
into
her
head
illustration
girl

shed
she
looked
from
the
window
each
morning
at
dawn
and
pictures
of
rapture
were
constantly
drawn
for
out
on
the
lawn
near
a
little
old
shed
were
dishes
and
troughs
where
the
chickens
were
fed
and
biddy
thought
wisely
these
things
i
shall
use
the
largest
and
neatest
are
what
i
shall
choose
but
never
a
thought
did
this
wise
mother
take
of
danger
or
trouble
in
mary
lake
how
happy
she
was
when
the
first
sounds
were
heard
and
the
bright
downy
heads
her
soft
feathers
stirred
but
what
is
the
matter
with
each
little
nose
she
said
in
amazement
and
what
ails
their
toes
they
are
not
like
chickens
at
all
i
am
sure
i
wonder
whatever
such
strange
things
will
cure
and
biddy
once
more
was
in
trouble
most
deep
for
none
of
her
children
could
really
say
peep

i
think
that
my
babes
for
a
walk
ought
to
go
one
morning
said
biddy
i
lead
them
just
so
i
watch
every
minute
lest
danger
arise
for
they
not
be
safe
when
from
under
my
eyes
at
the
word
every
downy
ball
hustled
about
and
ere
biddy
knew
it
they
all
had
jumped
out
of
the
nest
and
were
darting
about
in
the
sun
for
bugs
and
for
grass
blades
and
simply
for
fun
biddy
watched
for
a
time
and
then
softly
said
i
ought
to
be
dusting
my
feathers
and
head
so
off
to
the
roadside
she
hastily
went
and
there
in
the
soft
sand
a
few
moments
spent

what
was
it
made
biddy
heart
quiver
and
leap
it
was
the
sound
of
a
young
chicken
peep
but
the
splashing
of
water
and
of
wings
and
leaving
the
road
side
she
screamed
of
all
things
her
babies
were
all
in
the
watering
trough
regardless
of
sickness
disease
and
of
cough
oh
dear
cried
poor
biddy
what
now
shall
i
do
my
children
will
drown
and
before
my
eyes
too
and
mistress
cried
biddy
now
please
do
you
fear
they
simply
water
and
oh
are
they
dear
i
keep
them
all
safe
so
biddy
go
and
let
your
poor
children
have
freedom
to
play

each

in

and
the
puddles
they
played
and
off
where
the
grass
was
the
deepest
they
stayed
while
biddy
would
search
for
them
clucking
for
hours
over
the
barnyard
and
in
the
flowers
the
little
log
barn
was
a
refuge
at
night
where
often
poor
biddy
for
courage
would
fight
and
there
with
her
feathers
above
her
young
brood
she
tried
to
instruct
them
in
ways
to
be
good

walk
in
a
row
where
apples
were
juicy
and
mellow
one
day
these
ten
naughty
children
were
gathered
to
play
when
suddenly
one
of
them
leading
the
band
said
come
let
us
travel
and
there
a
trip
planned
so
off
they
all
went
toward
the
shed
and
the
pump
turning
out
now
and
then
for
a
log
or
a
stump
and
down
the
steep
hill
where
the
clover
bloomed
bright
the
little
band
wandered
in
perfect
delight
the
moment
that
biddy
discovered
the
plot
she
rushed
in
confusion
and
soon
reached
the
spot
oh
children
be
careful
she
screamed
in
alarm
in
the
lake
i
sure
you
will
meet
with
some
harm
but
to
cry
and
protest
and
urge
them
to
come
seemed
all
of
no
use
for
they
would
not
go
home
and
biddy
exclaimed
to
herself
in
disgust
to
stand
this
i
can
not
and
leave
them
i
must
the
evening
shades
gathered
that
night
in
the
sky
the
wind
sung
most
softly
a
sweet
but
biddy
had
left
her
dear
children
alone
she
found
they
were
ducklings
and
such
could
not
own
the
end
