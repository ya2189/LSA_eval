ashtaroth
a
dramatic
lyric
in
memoriam
l
gordon
at
rest
hard
by
the
margin
of
that
sea
whose
sounds
are
mingled
with
his
noble
verse
now
lies
the
shell
that
never
more
will
house
the
fine
strong
spirit
of
my
gifted
friend
yea
he
who
flashed
upon
us
suddenly
a
shining
soul
with
syllables
of
fire
who
sang
the
first
great
songs
these
lands
can
claim
to
be
their
own
the
one
who
did
not
seem
to
know
what
royal
place
awaited
him
within
the
temple
of
the
beautiful
has
passed
away
and
we
who
knew
him
sit
aghast
in
darkness
dumb
with
that
great
grief
whose
stature
yet
we
can
not
comprehend
while
over
yonder
churchyard
hearsed
with
pines
the
sings
its
immemorial
hymn
and
sobs
above
a
grave
the
bard
the
scholar
and
the
man
who
lived
that
frank
that
life
which
keeps
the
splendid
fire
of
english
chivalry
from
dying
out
the
one
who
never
wronged
a
the
faithful
friend
who
judged
the
many
anxious
to
be
loved
of
him
by
what
he
saw
and
not
by
what
he
heard
as
lesser
spirits
do
the
brave
great
soul
that
never
told
a
lie
or
turned
aside
to
fly
from
danger
he
i
say
was
one
of
that
bright
company
this
world
can
ill
afford
to
lose
they
did
not
know
the
hundreds
who
had
read
his
sturdy
verse
and
revelled
over
ringing
major
notes
the
mournful
meaning
of
the
undersong
which
runs
through
all
he
wrote
and
often
takes
the
deep
autumnal
tone
of
forest
winds
in
march
nor
did
they
think
that
on
that
man
there
lay
the
wild
specific
curse
which
seems
to
cling
for
ever
to
the
poet
twofold
life
to
adam
lindsay
gordon
i
who
laid
two
years
ago
on
lionel
michael
grave
a
tender
leaf
of
my
regard
yea
i
who
culled
a
garland
from
the
flowers
of
song
to
place
where
harpur
sleeps
i
left
alone
the
sad
disciple
of
a
shining
band
now
gone
to
adam
lindsay
gordon
name
i
dedicate
these
lines
and
if
is
true
that
past
the
darkness
of
the
grave
the
soul
becomes
omniscient
then
the
bard
may
stoop
from
his
high
seat
to
take
the
offering
and
read
it
with
a
sigh
for
human
friends
in
human
bonds
and
gray
with
human
griefs
and
having
wove
and
proffered
this
poor
wreath
i
stand
as
lone
as
he
who
saw
at
nightfall
through
the
glimmering
moony
mists
the
last
of
arthur
on
the
wailing
mere
and
strained
in
vain
to
hear
the
going
voice
henry
kendall
preface
the
poems
of
gordon
have
an
interest
beyond
the
mere
personal
one
which
his
friends
attach
to
his
name
written
as
they
were
at
odd
times
and
leisure
moments
of
a
stirring
and
adventurous
life
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
if
they
are
unequal
or
unfinished
the
astonishment
of
those
who
knew
the
man
and
can
gauge
the
capacity
of
this
city
to
foster
poetic
instinct
is
that
such
work
was
ever
produced
here
at
all
intensely
nervous
and
feeling
much
of
that
shame
at
the
exercise
of
the
higher
intelligence
which
besets
those
who
are
known
to
be
renowned
in
field
sports
gordon
produced
his
poems
shyly
scribbled
them
on
scraps
of
paper
and
sent
them
anonymously
to
magazines
it
was
not
until
he
discovered
one
morning
that
everybody
knew
a
couplet
or
two
of
how
we
beat
the
favourite
that
he
consented
to
forego
his
anonymity
and
appear
in
the
unsuspected
character
of
a
versemaker
the
success
of
his
republished
collected
poems
gave
him
courage
and
the
unreserved
praise
which
greeted
bush
ballads
should
have
urged
him
to
forget
or
to
conquer
those
evil
promptings
which
unhappily
brought
about
his
untimely
death
adam
lindsay
gordon
was
the
son
of
an
officer
in
the
english
army
and
was
educated
at
woolwich
in
order
that
he
might
follow
the
profession
of
his
family
at
the
time
when
he
was
a
cadet
there
was
no
sign
of
either
of
the
two
great
wars
which
were
about
to
call
forth
the
strength
of
english
arms
and
like
many
other
men
of
his
day
he
quitted
his
prospects
of
service
and
emigrated
he
went
to
south
australia
and
started
as
a
sheep
farmer
his
efforts
were
attended
with
failure
he
lost
his
capital
and
owning
nothing
but
a
love
for
horsemanship
and
a
head
full
of
browning
and
shelley
plunged
into
the
varied
life
which
overlanding
and
affords
from
this
experience
he
emerged
to
light
in
melbourne
as
the
best
amateur
steeplechase
rider
in
the
colonies
the
victory
he
won
for
major
baker
in
when
he
rode
babbler
for
the
cup
steeplechase
made
him
popular
and
the
almost
simultaneous
publication
of
his
last
volume
of
poems
gave
him
welcome
entrance
to
the
houses
of
all
who
had
pretensions
to
literary
taste
the
reputation
of
the
book
spread
to
england
and
major
whyte
melville
did
not
disdain
to
place
the
lines
of
the
dashing
australian
author
at
the
head
of
his
own
dashing
descriptions
of
sporting
scenery
unhappily
the
melancholy
which
gordon
friends
had
with
pain
observed
increased
daily
and
in
the
full
flood
of
his
success
with
congratulations
pouring
upon
him
from
every
side
he
was
found
dead
in
the
heather
near
his
home
with
a
bullet
from
his
own
rifle
in
his
brain
i
do
not
propose
to
criticise
the
volumes
which
these
few
lines
of
preface
introduce
to
the
reader
the
influence
of
browning
and
of
swinburne
upon
the
writer
taste
is
plain
there
is
plainly
visible
also
however
a
keen
sense
for
natural
beauty
and
a
manly
admiration
for
healthy
living
if
in
ashtaroth
and
bellona
we
recognise
the
swing
of
a
familiar
metre
in
such
poems
as
the
sick
stockrider
we
perceive
the
genuine
poetic
instinct
united
to
a
very
clear
perception
of
the
loveliness
of
duty
and
of
labour
was
merry
in
the
glowing
morn
among
the
gleaming
grass
to
wander
as
we
wandered
many
a
mile
and
blow
the
cool
tobacco
cloud
and
watch
the
white
wreaths
pass
sitting
loosely
in
the
saddle
all
the
while
was
merry
the
blackwoods
when
we
spied
the
station
roofs
to
wheel
the
wild
scrub
cattle
at
the
yard
with
a
running
fire
of
stockwhips
and
a
fiery
run
of
hoofs
oh
the
hardest
day
was
never
then
too
hard
aye
we
had
a
glorious
gallop
after
and
his
gang
when
they
bolted
from
sylvester
on
the
flat
how
the
crackled
how
the
ranges
rang
to
the
strokes
of
and
hard
behind
them
in
the
timber
harder
still
across
the
heath
close
behind
them
through
the
scrub
we
dashed
and
the
fern
leaves
how
they
rustled
underneath
and
the
honeysuckle
osiers
how
they
crash
this
is
genuine
there
is
no
poetic
evolution
from
the
depths
of
internal
consciousness
here
the
writer
has
ridden
his
ride
as
well
as
written
it
the
student
of
these
unpretending
volumes
will
be
repaid
for
his
labour
he
will
find
in
them
something
very
like
the
beginnings
of
a
national
school
of
australian
poetry
in
historic
europe
where
every
rood
of
ground
is
hallowed
in
legend
and
in
song
the
least
imaginative
can
find
food
for
sad
and
sweet
reflection
when
strolling
at
noon
down
an
english
country
lane
lounging
at
sunset
by
some
ruined
chapel
on
the
margin
of
an
irish
lake
or
watching
the
mists
of
morning
unveil
ben
lomond
we
feel
all
the
charm
which
springs
from
association
with
the
past
soothed
saddened
and
cheered
by
turns
we
partake
of
the
varied
moods
which
belong
not
so
much
to
ourselves
as
to
the
dead
men
who
in
old
days
sung
suffered
or
conquered
in
the
scenes
which
we
survey
but
this
our
native
or
adopted
land
has
no
past
no
story
no
poet
speaks
to
us
do
we
need
a
poet
to
interpret
nature
teachings
we
must
look
into
our
own
hearts
if
perchance
we
may
find
a
poet
there
what
is
the
dominant
note
of
australian
scenery
that
which
is
the
dominant
note
of
edgar
allan
poe
poetry
weird
melancholy
a
poem
like
could
never
be
written
by
an
australian
it
is
too
airy
too
sweet
too
freshly
happy
the
australian
mountain
forests
are
funereal
secret
stern
their
solitude
is
desolation
they
seem
to
stifle
in
their
black
gorges
a
story
of
sullen
despair
no
tender
sentiment
is
nourished
in
their
shade
in
other
lands
the
dying
year
is
mourned
the
falling
leaves
drop
lightly
on
his
bier
in
the
australian
forests
no
leaves
fall
the
savage
winds
shout
among
the
rock
clefts
from
the
melancholy
gums
strips
of
white
bark
hang
and
rustle
the
very
animal
life
of
these
frowning
hills
is
either
grotesque
or
ghostly
great
grey
kangaroos
hop
noiselessly
over
the
coarse
grass
flights
of
white
cockatoos
stream
out
shrieking
like
evil
souls
the
sun
suddenly
sinks
and
the
mopokes
burst
out
into
horrible
peals
of
laughter
the
natives
aver
that
when
night
comes
from
out
the
bottomless
depth
of
some
lagoon
the
bunyip
rises
and
in
form
like
monstrous
drags
his
loathsome
length
from
out
the
ooze
from
a
corner
of
the
silent
forest
rises
a
dismal
chant
and
around
a
fire
dance
natives
painted
like
skeletons
all
is
and
gloomy
no
bright
fancies
are
linked
with
the
memories
of
the
mountains
hopeless
explorers
have
named
them
out
of
their
sufferings
mount
misery
mount
dreadful
mount
despair
as
when
among
sylvan
scenes
in
places
made
green
with
the
running
of
rivers
and
gracious
with
temperate
air
the
soul
is
soothed
and
satisfied
so
placed
before
the
frightful
grandeur
of
these
barren
hills
it
drinks
in
their
sentiment
of
defiant
ferocity
and
is
steeped
in
bitterness
australia
has
rightly
been
named
the
land
of
the
dawning
wrapped
in
the
midst
of
early
morning
her
history
looms
vague
and
gigantic
the
lonely
horseman
riding
between
the
moonlight
and
the
day
sees
vast
shadows
creeping
across
the
shelterless
and
silent
plains
hears
strange
noises
in
the
primeval
forest
where
flourishes
a
vegetation
long
dead
in
other
lands
and
feels
despite
his
fortune
that
the
trim
utilitarian
civilisation
which
bred
him
shrinks
into
insignificance
beside
the
contemptuous
grandeur
of
forest
and
ranges
coeval
with
an
age
in
which
european
scientists
have
cradled
his
own
race
there
is
a
poem
in
every
form
of
tree
or
flower
but
the
poetry
which
lives
in
the
trees
and
flowers
of
australia
differs
from
those
of
other
countries
europe
is
the
home
of
knightly
song
of
bright
deeds
and
clear
morning
thought
asia
sinks
beneath
the
weighty
recollections
of
her
past
magnificence
as
the
suttee
sinks
jewel
burdened
upon
the
corpse
of
dread
grandeur
destructive
even
in
its
death
america
swiftly
hurries
on
her
way
rapid
glittering
insatiable
even
as
one
of
her
own
giant
waterfalls
from
the
jungles
of
africa
and
the
groves
of
the
islands
of
the
south
arise
from
the
glowing
hearts
of
a
thousand
flowers
heavy
and
intoxicating
odours
the
which
dwells
in
barbaric
sensuality
in
australia
alone
is
to
be
found
the
grotesque
the
weird
the
strange
scribblings
of
nature
learning
how
to
write
some
see
no
beauty
in
our
trees
without
shade
our
flowers
without
perfume
our
birds
who
can
not
fly
and
our
beasts
who
have
not
yet
learned
to
walk
on
all
fours
but
the
dweller
in
the
wilderness
acknowledges
the
subtle
charm
of
this
fantastic
land
of
monstrosities
he
becomes
familiar
with
the
beauty
of
loneliness
whispered
to
by
the
myriad
tongues
of
the
wilderness
he
learns
the
language
of
the
barren
and
the
uncouth
and
can
read
the
hieroglyphics
of
haggard
blown
into
odd
shapes
distorted
with
fierce
hot
winds
or
cramped
with
cold
nights
when
the
southern
cross
freezes
in
a
cloudless
sky
of
icy
blue
the
phantasmagoria
of
that
wild
dreamland
termed
the
bush
interprets
itself
and
the
poet
of
our
desolation
begins
to
comprehend
why
free
esau
loved
his
heritage
of
desert
sand
better
than

strife
shorter
doom
i
pictured
dimly
on
a
bed
of
crimson
sand
fighting
hard
and
dying
grimly
silent
lips
and
striking
hand
but
the
toughest
lives
are
brittle
and
the
bravest
and
the
best
lightly
fall
it
matters
little
now
i
only
long
for
rest
i
have
seen
enough
of
slaughter
seen
scamander
torrent
red
seen
hot
blood
poured
out
like
water
seen
the
champaign
heaped
with
dead
men
will
call
me
unrelenting
pitiless
vindictive
stern
few
will
raise
a
voice
dissenting
few
will
better
things
discern
speak
the
fires
of
life
are
reeling
like
the
wildfires
on
the
marsh

i
to
a

unfeeling

to

harsh
was
there
nought

bloodshed
throbbing

on

in

sobbing
dead

thou
dry
those

orbs
that
glisten
darling
i
have
had
my
day
place
your
hand
in
mine
and
listen
ere
the
strong
soul
cleaves
its
way
through
the
death
mist
hovering
me
as
the
stout
ship
cleaves
the
wave
to
my
fathers
gone
before
me
to
the
gods
who
love
the
brave
courage
we
must
part
for
certain
shades
that
sink
and
shades
that
rise
blending
in
a
curtain
gather
these
weary
eyes
the
fields
we
used
to
roam
in
brighter
days
and
lighter
cheer
gathers
thus
the
quiet
gloaming
now
i
ween
the
end
is
near
for
the
hand
that
clasps
your
fingers
closing
in
the
tight
scarcely
feels
the
warmth
that
lingers
scarcely
heeds
the
pressure
light
while
the
failing
pulse
that
alters
changing
a
death
chill
damp
flickers
flutters
flags
and
falters
feebly
like
a
waning
lamp
thou
love
chafe
my
ghost
in

realm
where
heroes
shine
should
i
hear
the
shepherd
boasting
to
his
argive
concubine
let
him
boast
the
girlish
victor
let
him
brag
not
thus
i
trow
were
the
laurels
torn
from
hector
not
so
very
long
ago
does
my
voice
sound
thick
and
husky
is
my
hand
no
longer
warm
round
that
neck
where
pearls
look
dusky
let
me
once
more
wind
my
arm
rest
my
head
upon
that
shoulder
where
it
rested
oft
of
yore
warm
and
white
yet
seeming
colder
now
than
it
seem
before
was
the
fraud
of
priam
daughter
not
the
force
of

son
slew
me
ask
not
why
i
sought
her
was
my
doom
her
work
is
done
fairer
far
than
she
and
dearer
by
a
thousandfold
thou
art
come
my

one
nestle
nearer
cheating
death
of
half
his
smart
slowly
while
your
amber
tresses
shower
down
their
golden
rain
let
me
drink
those
last
caresses
never
to
be
felt
again
yet
th
elysian
halls
are
spacious
somewhere
near
me
i
may
keep
room
who
knows
the
gods
are
gracious
lay
me
lower
let
me
sleep
lower
yet
my
senses
wander
and
my
spirit
seems
to
roll
with
the
tide
of
swift
scamander
rushing
to
a
viewless
goal
in
my
ears
like
distant
washing
of
the
surf
upon
the
shore
drones
a
murmur
faintly
splashing
is
the
splash
of
charon
oar
lower
yet
my
own
briseis
denser
shadows
veil
the
light
hush
what
is
to
be
to
be
is
close
my
eyes
and
say
lightly
lay
your
red
lips
kissing
on
this
cold
mouth
while
your
thumbs
lie
on
these
cold
eyelids
pressing
pallas
thus
thy
soldier
comes
gone
in
standeth
a
statue
tall
a
statue
tall
on
a
pillar
of
stone
telling
its
story
to
great
and
small
of
the
dust
reclaimed
from
the
sand
waste
lone
weary
and
wasted
and
worn
and
wan
feeble
and
faint
and
languid
and
low
he
lay
on
the
desert
a
dying
man
who
has
gone
my
friends
where
we
all
must
go
there
are
perils
by
land
and
perils
by
water
short
i
ween
are
the
obsequies
of
the
landsman
lost
but
they
may
be
shorter
with
the
mariner
lost
in
the
trackless
seas
and
well
for
him
when
the
timbers
start
and
the
stout
ship
reels
and
settles
below
who
goes
to
his
doom
with
as
bold
a
heart
as
that
dead
man
gone
where
we
all
must
go
man
is
stubborn
his
rights
to
yield
and
redder
than
dews
at
eventide
are
the
dews
of
battle
shed
on
the
field
by
a
nation
wrath
or
a
despot
pride
but
few
who
have
heard
their
roll
from
the
cannon
lips
where
they
faced
the
foe
have
fallen
as
stout
and
steady
of
soul
as
that
dead
man
gone
where
we
all
must
go
traverse
yon
spacious
many
are
sleeping
soundly
there
who
pass
with
mourners
standing
around
kindred
and
friends
and
children
fair
did
he
envy
such
ending
hard
to
say
had
he
cause
to
envy
such
ending
no
can
the
spirit
feel
for
the
senseless
clay
when
it
once
has
gone
where
we
all
must
go
what
matters
the
sand
or
the
whitening
chalk
the
blighted
herbage
the
log
the
crooked
beak
of
the
or
the
hot
red
tongue
of
the
native
dog
that
couch
was
rugged
those
sextons
rude
yet
in
spite
of
a
leaden
shroud
we
know
that
the
bravest
and
fairest
are
food
when
once
they
gone
where
we
all
must
go
with
the
pistol
clenched
in
his
failing
hand
with
the
death
mist
spread
his
fading
eyes
he
saw
the
sun
go
down
on
the
sand
and
he
slept
and
never
saw
it
rise
was
well
he
toil
till
his
task
was
done
constant
and
calm
in
his
latest
throe
the
storm
was
weathered
the
battle
was
won
when
he
went
my
friends
where
we
all
must
go
god
grant
that
whenever
soon
or
late
our
course
is
run
and
our
goal
is
reach
we
may
meet
our
fate
as
steady
and
straight
as
he
whose
bones
in
yon
desert
bleach
no
tears
are
needed
our
cheeks
are
dry
we
have
none
to
waste
upon
living
woe
shall
we
sigh
for
one
who
has
ceased
to
sigh
having
gone
my
friends
where
we
all
must
go
we
tarry
yet
we
are
toiling
still
he
is
gone
and
he
fares
the
best
he
fought
against
odds
he
struggled
up
hill
he
has
fairly
earned
his
season
of
rest
no
tears
are
needed
fill
out
the
wine
let
the
goblets
clash
and
the
grape
juice
flow
ho
pledge
me
a
comrade
mine
to
a
brave
man
gone
where
we
all
must
go
unshriven
oh
the
sun
rose
on
the
lea
and
the
bird
sang
merrilie
and
the
steed
stood
ready
harness
in
the
hall
and
he
left
his
lady
bower
and
he
sought
the
eastern
tower
and
he
lifted
cloak
and
weapon
from
the
wall
we
were
wed
but
must
we
separate
so
soon
must
you
travel
unassoiled
and
aye
unshriven
with
the
blood
stain
on
your
hand
and
the
red
streak
on
your
brand
and
your
guilt
all
unconfessed
and
unforgiven
tho
it
were
but
we
were
wedded
still
unshriven
across
the
moor
this
morning
i
must
ride
i
must
gallop
fast
and
straight
for
my
errand
will
not
wait
fear
naught
i
shall
return
at
eventide
if
i
fear
it
is
for
thee
thy
weal
is
dear
to
me
yon
moor
with
retribution
seemeth
rife
as
we
sown
so
must
we
reap
and
i
started
in
my
sleep
at
the
voice
of
the
avenger
for
life
my
arm
is
strong
i
ween
and
my
trusty
blade
is
keen
and
the
courser
that
i
ride
is
swift
and
sure
and
i
can
not
break
my
oath
though
to
leave
thee
i
am
loth
there
is
one
that
i
must
meet
upon
the
moor
oh
the
sun
shone
on
the
lea
and
the
bird
sang
merrilie
down
the
avenue
and
through
the
iron
gate
spurr
and
belted
so
he
rode
steel
to
draw
and
steel
to
goad
and
across
the
moor
he
galloped
fast
and
straight
oh
the
sun
shone
on
the
lea
and
the
bird
sang
full
of
glee
ere
the
mists
of
evening
gather
chill
and
grey
but
the
wild
bird
merry
note
on
the
deaf
ear
never
smote
and
the
sunshine
never
warmed
the
lifeless
clay
ere
the
sun
began
to
droop
or
the
mist
began
to
stoop
the
youthful
bride
lay
swooning
in
the
hall
empty
saddle
on
his
back
broken
bridle
hanging
slack
the
steed
returned
full
gallop
to
the
stall
oh
the
sun
sank
in
the
sea
and
the
wind
wailed

let
the
bells
in
yonder

in

like

upon

of

you
can
crop
the

as
fast
as

while
i

thus
all
alone
by
the

and
wold
i
yield
myself
once
again
to
the
memories
old
that
like
tales
fresh
told
come
flitting
across
the
brain
fytte
ii
by

a
legend
of

cottiswold

have
saddled
a

black
old
ballad
he
turned
in
his

now
follow
who
dare
i
ride
for
my
country
quoth
lawrence
i
remember
the
lowering
wintry
morn
and
the
mist
on
the
cotswold
hills
where
i
once
heard
the
blast
of
the
huntsman
horn
not
far
from
the
seven
rills
jack
esdale
was
there
and
hugh
clair
bob
chapman
and
andrew
kerr
and
big
george
griffiths
on
and
black
tom

and
one
who
rode
on
a
steed
clean
jointed
sinewy
spare
with
the
lean
game
head
of
the
blacklock
breed
and
the
resolute
eye
that
loves
the
lead
and
the
quarters
massive
and
square
a
tower
of
strength
with
a
promise
of
speed
there
was
celtic
blood
in
the
pair
i
remember
how
merry
a
start
we
got
when
the
red
fox
broke
from
the
gorse
in
a
country
so
deep
with
a
scent
so
hot
that
the
hound
could
outpace
the
horse
i
remember
how
few
in
the
front
rank
shew
how
endless
appeared
the
tail
on
the
brown
where
we
cross
the
road
and
headed
towards
the
vale
the
steed
on
the
left
was
there
on
the
right
was
a
dappled
grey
and
between
the
pair
on
a
chestnut
mare
the
duffer
who
writes
this
lay
what
business
had
this
child
there
to
ride
but
little
or
none
at
all
yet
i
held
my
own
for
a
while
in
the
pride
that
goeth
before
a
fall
though
rashness
can
hope
for
but
one
result
we
are
heedless
when
fate
draws
nigh
us

set
your

as

solid
and
tall
is
the
rasping
wall
that
stretches
before
us
yonder
you
must
have
it
at
speed
or
not
at
all
better
to
halt
than
to
ponder
for
the
stream
runs
wide
on
the
side
and
washes
the
clay
bank

a
pull

a
broken
neck
if
you
blunder
no
word
in

his
comrade
spoke
nor
waver
nor
once
look
round
but
i
saw
him
shorten
his
horse
stroke
as
we
splash
through
the
marshy
ground
i
remember
the
laugh
that
all
the
while
on
his
quiet
features
play
so
he
rode
to
his
death
with
that
careless
smile
in
the
van
of
the
light
brigade
so
stricken
by
russian
grape
the
cheer
rang
out
while
he
toppled
back
from
the
shattered
lungs
as
merry
and
clear
as
it
did
when
it
roused
the
pack
let
never
a
tear
his
memory
stain
give
his
ashes
never
a
sigh
one
of
many
who
perished
not
in
vain
as
a
type
of
our
chivalry
i
remember
one
thrust
he
gave
to
his
hat
and
two
to
the
flanks
of
the
brown
and
still
as
a
statue
of
old
he
sat
and
he
shot
to
the
front
hands
down
i
remember
the
snort
and
the
bound
of
the
steed
six
lengths
to
the
fore
and
the
laugh
of
the
rider
while
landing
sound
he
turned
in
his
saddle
and
glanced
around
i
remember
but
little
more
save
a
gleam
of
the
dashing
stream
a
jarring
thud
on
the
wall
a
shock
and
the
blank
of
a
nightmare

of

i
remember
some
words
my
father
said
when
i
was
an
urchin
vain
god
rest
his
soul
in
his
narrow
bed
these
ten
long
years
he
hath
lain
when
i
think
one
drop
of
the
blood
he
bore
this
faint
heart
surely
must
hold
it
may
be
my
fancy
and
nothing
more
but
the
faint
heart
seemeth
bold
he
said
that
as
from
the
blood
of
grape
or
from
juice
distilled
from
the
grain
false
vigour
soon
to
evaporate
is
lent
to
nerve
and
brain
so
the
coward
will
dare
on
the
gallant
horse
what
he
never
would
dare
alone
because
he
exults
in
a
borrowed
force
and
a
hardihood
not
his
own
and
it
may
be
so
yet
this
difference
lies
the
vine
and
the
the
spurious
courage
that
drink
supplies
sets
our
baser
passions
free
but
the
stimulant
which
the
horseman
feels
when
he
gallops
fast
and
straight
to
his
better
nature
most
appeals
and
charity
conquers
hate
as
the
kindly
sunshine
thaws
the
snow
malice
and
spite
will
yield
we
could
almost
welcome
our
mortal
foe
in
the

and
chivalry
dawns
in
the
merry
tale
that
market
harborough
writes
and
the
yarns
of

if

do

plan
when
against

you
driven
mere

sublime

dismay
since
no

i
can
scarce

that
the

lies

scarce
can
believe
her
true
and
the

replies
till
we
test
her
eyes
let
her
words
gain
credence
due
down
the
rocky
path
knight

led
while

and

bold
followed
in

for
like

spread
the
news
by
the

told
they
found
was
even
as
she
had
said
the
corpse
had
some
while
been
cold
how
the
spirit
had
pass
in
the
moments

there
was

trace
to
reveal
on
the
still

face

no
imprint
ghast
save
the

solemn
seal
yet
the
hands
were
clench
in
a
fast
and
the
sods
stamp
down
by
the
heel
sir
hugh
by
the
side
of
the
dead
man
knelt
said
full
well
these
features
i
know
we
have
faced
each
other
where
blows
were
dealt
and
he
was
a
stalwart
foe
i
had
rather
have
met
him
hilt
to
hilt
than
have
found
him
lying
low
he
turn
the
body
up
on
its
face
and
never
a
word
was
spoken
while
he
ripp
the
doublet
and
tore
the
lace
and
tugg
by
the
token
and
strain
till
he
wrench
it
out
of
its
place
the
that
was
broken
then
he
turned
the
body
over
again
and
said
while
he
rose
upright
may

cain
with
its
withering
stain
on

forehead
light
for
he
never
was
slain
on
the
open
plain
nor
yet
in

open
fight

stern
were
the
words
he
spoke
and
he
look
at
his
lady
men
but
his
speech
no
answering
echoes
woke
all
were
silent
there
and
then
till
a
clear
cold
voice
the
silence
broke
lady
mabel
cried
amen
his
glance
met
hers
the
twain
stood
hush
with
the
dead
between
them
there
but
the
blood
to
her
snowy
temples
till
it
tinged
the
roots
of
her
hair
then
paled
but
a
thin
red
streak
still
in
the
midst
of
her
forehead
fair
four
yeomen
raised
the
corpse
from
the
ground
at
a
sign
from
sir
hugh
de
vere
it
was
borne
to
the
western
turret
round
and
laid
on
a
knightly
bier
with
never
a
sob
nor
a
mourning
sound
no
friend
to
the
dead
was
near
yet
that
night
was
neither
revel
nor
dance
in
the
halls
of
fauconshawe
men
looked
askance
with
a
doubtful
glance
at
sir
hugh
for
they
stood
in
awe
of
his
prowess
but
he
like
one
in
a
trance
regarded
naught
that
he
saw
night
black
and
chill
wind
gathering
still
with
its
wail
in
the
turret
tall
and
its
headlong
blast
like
a
catapult
cast
on
the
crest
of
the
outer
wall
and
its
hail
and
rain
on
the
crashing
pane
till
the
glassy
splinters
fall
a
moody
knight
by
the
fitful
light
of
the
great
hall
fire
below
a
corpse
upstairs
and
a
woman
at
prayers
will
they
profit
her
aye
or
no

fain
an
she
comfort
gain
there
is
comfort
for
us
also
the
guests
were
gone
save
sir
hugh
alone
and
he
watched
the
gleams
that
broke
on
the
pale
and
flickered
and
shone
on
the
panels
of
polish
oak
he
was
of
no
presence
except
his
own
till
the
voice
of
young
margaret
spoke
i

at
the
mirk
midnight
i
can
not
sleep
in

rushes
along
but
thy

i

thee

storm
winds
eddy
and
scream
and
hurl
their
wrath
they
disturb
me
naught
the
daughter
she
of
a
earl
no
secret
of
hers
i
sought
i
am
but
the
child
of
a
peasant
churl
yet
look
to
the
proofs
i
brought
this
dagger
snapp
so
close
to
the
hilt
dost
remember
thy
token
well
will
it
match
with
the
broken
blade
that
spilt
his
life
in
the
western
dell
nay
read
her
handwriting
an
thou
wilt
from
her
paramour
breast
it
fell
the
knight
in
silence
the
letter
read
oh
the
characters
well
he
knew
and
his
face
might
have
match
the
face
of
the
dead
so
ashen
white
was
its
hue
then
he
tore
the
parchment
shred
by
shred
and
the
strips
in
the
flames
he
threw
and
he
muttered
densely
those
shadows
fall
in
the
copse
where
the
alders
thicken
there
she
bade
him
come
to
her
once
for
all
now
i
well
may
shudder
and
sicken
gramercy
that
hand
so
white
and
small
how
strongly
it
must
have
stricken
at
midnight
hour
in
the
western
tower
alone
with
the
dead
man
there
lady
mabel
kneels
nor
heeds
nor
feels
the
shock
of
the
rushing
air
though
the
gusts
that
pass
through
the
riven
glass
have
scattered
her
raven
hair
across
the
floor
through
the
opening
door
where
standeth
a
stately
knight
the
lamplight
streams
and
flickers
and
gleams
on
his
features
stern
and
white
is
sir
hugh
de
vere
and
he
cometh
more
near
and
the
lady
standeth
upright
is
little
he
said
that
i
know
or
care
of
the
guilt
if
guilt
there
be
that
lies
thee
and
yon
dead
man
there
nor
matters
it
now
to
me
i
thought
thee
pure
thou
art
only
fair
and
i
cross
the
sea
he
perish
i
ask
not
why
or
how
i
come
to
recall
my
troth
take
back
my
lady
thy
broken
vow
give
back
my
allegiance
oath
let
the
past
be
buried
between
us
now
for
ever
is
best
for
both
yet
mabel
i
could
ask
dost
thou
dare
lay
hand
on
that
corpse
heart
and
call
on
thy
maker
and
boldly
swear
that
thou
hadst
in
his
death
no
part
i
ask
not
while
threescore
proofs
i
share
with
one
doubt
uncondemn
thou
art
oh
cold
and
bleak
upon
mabel
cheek
came
the
blast
of
the
keen
and
her
tresses
black
as
the
glossy
back
of
the
raven
glanced
between
her
fingers
slight
like
the
ivory
white
as
she
parted
their
sable
sheen
yet
with
steady
lip
and
with
fearless
eye
and
with
cheek
like
the
flush
of
dawn
unflinchingly
she
spoke
in
reply
go
hence
with
the
break
of
morn
i
will
neither
confess
nor
yet
deny
i
will
return
thee
scorn
for
scorn
the
knight
bow
low
as
he
turn
to
go
he
travell
by
land
and
sea
but
naught
of
his
future
fate
i
know
and
naught
of
his
fair
ladye
my
story
is
told
as
long
ago
my
story
was
told
to
me
rippling
water
the
maiden
sat
by
the
river
side
the
rippling
water
murmurs
by
and
sadly
into
the
clear
blue
tide
the
salt
tear
fell
from
her
clear
blue
eye
is
fixed
for
better
for
worse
she
cried
and
the
bridegroom
claims
the
bride
oh
wealth
and
power
and
rank
and
pride
can
surely
peace
and
happiness
buy
i
was
merry
nathless
in
my
girlhood
hours
the
waving
grass
when
the
bright
sun
shone
shall
i
be
as
merry
in
marmaduke
towers
the
rippling
water
murmurs
on
stephen
works
for
his
daily
bread
the
rippling
water
murmurs
low
through
the
crazy
thatch
that
covers
his
head
the
fall
and
the
blow
i
mend
the
old
so
he
said
and
repair
the
cottage
when
we
are
and
my
pulses
throbb
and
my
cheek
grew
red
when
he
kiss
me
that
was
long
ago
stephen
and
i
should
we
meet
again
not
as
we
met
in
days
that
are
gone
will
my
pulses
throb
with
pleasure
or
pain
the
rippling
water
murmurs
on
old
giles
the
gardener
strok
my
curls
the
rippling
water
murmurs
past
quoth
he
in
laces
and
silks
and
pearls
my
child
will
see
her
reflection
cast
now
i
trust
in
my
heart
that
your
lord
will
be
kinder
to
you
than
he
was
to
me
when
i
lay
in
the
gaol
and
my
children
three
with
their
sickly
mother
kept
bitter
fast
with
marmaduke
now
my
will
is
law
marmaduke
will
may
be
law
anon
does
the
sheath
of
velvet
cover
the
claw
the
rippling
water
murmurs
on
dame
martha
patted
me
on
the
cheek
the
rippling
water
murmurs
low
saying
there
are
words
that
i
fain
would
speak
perhaps
they
were
best
unspoken
though
i
ca
persuade
you
to
change
your
mind
and
useless
warnings
are
scarcely
kind
and
i
may
be
foolish
as
well
as
blind
but
take
my
blessing
whether
or
no
dame
martha
wise
though
her
hair
is
white
her
sense
is
good
though
her
sight
is
gone
can
she
really
be
gifted
with
second
sight
the
rippling
water
murmurs
on
brian
of
hawksmede
came
to
our
cot
the
rippling
water
murmurs
by
scatter
the
sods
of
our
garden
plot
riding
his
roan
horse
recklessly
trinket
and
token
and
tress
of
hair
he
flung
them
down
at
the
there
said
elsie
ask
your
lord
if
you
dare
who
gave
him
the
blow
as
well
as
the
lie
that
evening
i
mentioned
brian
name
and
marmaduke
face
grew
white
and
wan
am
i
pledged
to
one
of
a
spirit
so
tame
the
rippling
water
murmurs
on
brian
is
headstrong
rash
and
vain
the
rippling
water
murmurs
still
stephen
is
somewhat
duller
of
brain
slower
of
speech
and
milder
of
will
stephen
must
toil
a
living
to
gain
plough
and
harrow
and
gather
the
grain
brian
has
little
enough
to
maintain
the
station
in
life
which
he
needs
must
fill
both
are
fearless
and
kind
and
frank
but
we
ca
win
all
gifts
under
the
sun
what
have
i
won
save
riches
and
rank
the
rippling
water
murmurs
on
riches
and
rank
and
what
beside
the
rippling
water
murmurs
yet
the
mansion
is
stately
the
manor
is
wide
their
lord
for
a
while
may
pamper
and
pet
liveried
lackeys
may
jeer
aside
though
the
peasant
girl
is
their
master
bride
at
her
shyness
mingled
with
awkward
pride
folly
for
trifles
like
these
to
fret
but
the
love
of
one
that
i
can
not
love
will
it
last
when
the
gloss
of
his
toy
is
gone
is
there
naught
beyond
below
or
above
the
rippling
water
murmurs
on
cui
bono
oh
wind
that
whistles
thorns
and
thistles
of
this
fruitful
earth
like
a
goblin
elf
why
should
he
labour
to
help
his
neighbour
who
feels
too
reckless
to
help
himself
the
wail
of
the
breeze
in
the
bending
trees
is
something
between
a
laugh
and
a
groan
and
the
hollow
roar
of
the
surf
on
the
shore
is
a
dull
discordant
monotone
i
wish
i
could
guess
what
sense
they
express
there
a
meaning
doubtless
in
every
sound
yet
no
one
can
tell
and
it
may
be
as
well
whom
would
it
profit
the
world
goes
round
on
this
earth
so
rough
we
know
quite
enough
and
i
sometimes
fancy
a
little
too
much
the
sage
may
be
wiser
than
clown
or
than
kaiser
is
he
more
to
be
envied
for
being
such
neither
more
nor
less
in
his
idleness
the
sage
is
doom
to
vexation
sure
the
kaiser
may
rule
but
the
slippery
stool
that
he
calls
his
throne
is
no
sinecure
and
as
for
the
clown
you
may
give
him
a
crown
maybe
he
thank
you
and
maybe
not
and
before
you
can
wink
he
may
spend
it
in
drink
to
whom
does
it
profit
we
ripe
and
rot
yet
under
the
sun
much
work
is
done
by
clown
and
kaiser
by
serf
and
sage
all
sow
and
some
reap
and
few
gather
the
heap
of
the
garner
grain
of
a
age
by
sea
or
by
soil
man
is
bound
to
toil
and
the
dreamer
waiting
for
time
and
tide
for
awhile
may
shirk
his
share
of
the
work
but
he
grows
with
his
dream
dissatisfied
he
may
climb
to
the
edge
of
the
beetling
ledge
where
the
loose
crag
topples
and
reels
the
lashing
gale
but
the
tonic
will
fail
what
does
it
profit
wheels
within
wheels
aye
work
we
must
or
with
idlers
rust
and
eat
we
must
our
bodies
to
nurse
some
folk
grow
fatter
what
does
it
matter
i
blest
if
i
do
quite
the
reverse
is
a
weary
round
to
which
we
are
bound
the
same
thing
over
and
over
again
much
toil
and
trouble
and
a
glittering
bubble
that
rises
and
bursts
is
the
best
we
gain
and
we
murmur
and
yet
is
certain
we
get
what
good
we
deserve
can
we
hope
for
more
they
are
roaring
those
waves
in
their
echoing
caves
to
whom
do
they
profit
let
them
roar
bellona
thou
art
moulded
in
marble
impassive
false
goddess
fair
statue
of
strife
yet
standest
on
pedestal
massive
a
symbol
and
token
of
life
thou
art
still
not
with
stillness
of
languor
and
calm
not
with
calm
boding
rest
for
thine
is
all
wrath
and
all
anger
that
throbs
far
and
near
in
the
breast
of
man
by
thy
presence
possess
with
the
brow
of
a
fallen
archangel
the
lips
of
a
beautiful
fiend
and
locks
that
are
to
strangle
and
eyes
from
whose
depths
may
be
the
presence
of
passions
that
tremble
unbidden
yet
shine
as
they
may
through
features
too
proud
to
dissemble
too
cold
and
too
calm
to
betray
their
secrets
to
creatures
of
clay
thy
breath
stirreth
faction
and
party
men

and
no
voice
can

to
stay
them
astarte
herself
at
thy
presence

pale
for
deeper
and
richer
the
crimson
that
gathers
behind
thee
throws
forth
a
halo
thy
raiment
and
limbs
on
and
leaves
a
red
track
in
the
path
that
flows
from
thy
of
wrath
for
behind
thee
red
rivulets
trickle
men
fall
by
thy
hands
swift
and
lithe
as
corn
falleth
down
to

as

down

thine
arm
strong
and
cruel
and

pitiless
lance
and

and

around
thee

trance
we
too
with
our

thus
weakly
with

hard
and
dangerous
thus
we
owe
thee
the
saints
suffered
meekly
their
wrongs
it
is
not
so
with
us
some
share
of
thy
strength
thou
hast
given
to
mortals
refusing
in
vain
thine
aid
we
have
suffered
and
striven
till
we
have
grown
reckless
of
pain
though

and
of

if

false

our
senses
are

our
souls
tricked
by
thee
and
thy
hollow
ideal

soldier
who
falls
in
his
harness
and
strikes
his
last
stroke
with
slack
hand
on
his
dead
face
thy
wrath
and
thy
scorn
is
imprinted
oh
seeks
he
a
land
where
he
shall
escape
thy
command
when
the
blood
of
thy
victims
lies
red
on
that
stricken
field
fiercest
and
last
in
the
sunset
that
gilds
armageddon
with
still
overcast
when
the
smoke
of
thy
hot
conflagrations
the
earth
as
with
wings
where
nations
have
fought
against
nations
and
kings
have
encounter
with
kings
when
cometh
the
end
of
all
things
then
those
who
have
patiently
waited
and
borne
unresisting
the
pain
of
thy
vengeance
unglutted
unsated
shall
they
be
rewarded
again
then
those
who
enticed
by
thy
laurels
or
urged
by
thy
promptings
unblest
have
striven
and
stricken
in
quarrels
shall
they
too
find
pardon
and
rest
we
know
not

hope
for
the
best
the
song
of
the
surf
white
steeds
of
ocean
that
leap
with
a
hollow
and
wearisome
roar
on
the
bar
of
ironstone
steep
not
a
fathom
length
from
the
shore
is
there
never
a
seer
nor
sophist
can
interpret
your
wild
refrain
when
speech
the
harshest
and
roughest
is
seldom
studied
in
vain
my
ears
are
constantly
smitten
by
that
dreary
monotone
in
a
hieroglyphic
is
written
is
spoken
in
a
tongue
unknown
gathering
growing
and
swelling
and
surging
and
shivering
say
what
is
the
tale
you
are
telling
what
is
the
drift
of
your
lay
you
come
and
your
crests
are
hoary
with
the
foam
of
your
countless
years
you
break
with
a
rainbow
of
glory
through
the
spray
of
your
glittering
tears
is
your
song
a
song
of
gladness
a
paean
of
joyous
might
or
a
wail
of
discordant
sadness
for
the
wrongs
you
never
can
right
for
the
empty
seat
by
the
ingle
for
children
of
their
sire
for
the
bride
sitting
sad
and
single
and
pale
by
the
flickering
fire
for
your
ravenous
pools
of
suction
for
your
shattering
billow
swell
for
your
ceaseless
work
of
destruction
for
your
hunger
insatiable
not
far
from
this
very
place
on
the
sand
and
the
shingle
dry
he
lay
with
his
batter
face
upturned
to
the
frowning
sky
when
your
waters
wash
and
swill
high
over
his
drowning
head
when
his
nostrils
and
lungs
were
filled
when
his
feet
and
hands
were
as
lead
when
against
the
rock
he
was
hurl
and
suck
again
to
the
sea
on
the
shores
of
another
world
on
the
brink
of
eternity
on
the
verge
of
annihilation
did
it
come
to
that
swimmer
strong
the
sudden
interpretation
of
your
mystical
song
mortal
that
which
thou
askest
ask
not
thou
of
the
waves
fool
thou
foolishly
taskest
us
we
are
only
slaves
might
more
mighty
impels
us
we
must
our
lot
fulfil
he
who
gathers
and
swells
us
curbs
us
too
at
his
will
thou
the
wave
that
shatters
questioneth
his
decree
little
to
us
it
matters
and
naught
it
matters
to
thee
not
thus
murmuring
idly
we
from
our
duty
would
swerve
over
the
world
spread
widely
ever
we
labour
and
serve
whisperings
in
oh
gaily
sings
the
bird
and
the
are
and
rustled
by
the
scented
breath
of
spring
oh
the
dreary
wistful
longing
oh
the
faces
that
are
thronging
oh
the
voices
that
are
vaguely
whispering
oh
tell
me
father
mine
ere
the
good
ship
cross
the
brine
on
the
gangway
one
mute
we
exchang
do
you
past
the
grave
employ
for
your
stubborn
reckless
boy
those
petitions
that
in
life
were
estranged
oh
tell
me
sister
dear
parting
word
and
parting
tear
never
pass
between
us
let
me
bear
the
blame
are
you
living
girl
or
dead
bitter
tears
since
then
i
shed
for
the
lips
that
lisp
with
mine
a
mother
name
oh
tell
me
ancient
friend
ever
ready
to
defend
in
our
boyhood
at
the
base
of
life
long
hill
are
you
waking
yet
or
sleeping
have
you
left
this
vale
of
weeping
or
do
you
like
your
comrade
linger
still
oh
whisper
buried
love
is
there
rest
and
peace
above
there
is
little
hope
or
comfort
here
below
on
your
sweet
face
lies
the
mould
and
your
bed
is
straight
and
cold
near
the
harbour
where
the
ebb
and
flow
all
silent
they
are
dumb
and
the
breezes
go
and
come
with
an
apathy
that
mocks
at
man
distress
laugh
scoffer
while
you
may
i
could
bow
me
down
and
pray
for
an
answer
that
might
stay
my
bitterness
oh
harshly
screams
the
bird
and
the
is
stirr
there
a
sullen
whisper
in
the
bough
aye
kneel
and
pray
and
weep
but
his
beloved
sleep
can
never
be
disturb
by
such
as
thou
confiteor
the
lies
in
the
morning
light
by
the
good
ship
ready
for
sailing
the
skies
are
clear
and
the
dawn
is
bright
tho
the
bar
of
the
bay
is
fleck
with
white
and
the
wind
is
fitfully
wailing
near
the
tiller
stands
the
priest
and
the
knight
leans
over
the
there
is
time
while
the
vessel
tarries
still
there
is
time
while

back
sir
priest
you
can
shrive
these
men
of
mine
and
i
pray
you
shrive
them
fast
and
shrive
those
hardy
sons
of
the
brine
captain
and
mates
of
the
eglantine
and
sailors
before
the
mast
then
pledge
me
a
cup
of
the
cyprus
wine
for
i
fain
would
bury
the
past
and
hast
thou
naught
to
repent
my
son
dost
thou
scorn
confession
and
shrift
ere
thy
sands
from
the
glass
of
time
shall
run
is
there
naught
undone
that
thou
have
done
naught
done
that
thou
have
left
the
guiltiest
soul
may
from
guilt
be
won
and
the
stoniest
heart
may
be
cleft
have
my
ears
been
closed
to
the
prayer
of
the
poor
or
deaf
to
the
cry
of
distress
have
i
given
little
and
taken
more
have
i
brought
a
curse
to
the
widow
door
have
i
wrong
the
fatherless
have
i
steep
my
fingers
in
guiltless
gore
that
i
must
perforce
confess
have
thy
steps
been
guided
by
purity
through
the
paths
with
wickedness
rife
hast
thou
never
smitten
thine
enemy
hast
thou
yielded
naught
to
the
lust
of
the
eye
and
naught
to
the
pride
of
life
hast
thou
pass
all
snares
of
pleasure
by
hast
thou
shunn
all
wrath
and
strife
nay
certes
a
sinful
life
i
led
yet
i
suffered
and
lived
in
hope
i
may
suffer
still
but
my
hope
has
fled
i
nothing
now
to
hope
or
to
dread
and
with
fate
i
can
fairly
cope
were
the
waters
closing
over
my
head
i
should
scarcely
catch
at
a
rope
dost
suffer
thy
pain
may
be
fraught
with
grace
since
never
by
works
alone
we
are
saved
the
penitent
thief
may
trace
the
wealth
of
love
in
the
saviour
face
to
the
pharisee
rarely
shown
and
the
magdalene
arms
may
yet
embrace
the
foot
of
the
jasper
throne
sir
priest
a
heavier
doom
i
dree
for
i
feel
no
quickening
pain
but
a
dull
dumb
weight
when
i
bow
my
knee
and
not
with
the
words
of
the
pharisee
my
hard
eyes
heavenward
strain
where
my
dead
darling
prayeth
for
me
now
i
wot
she
prayeth
in
vain
still
i
hear
it
over
the
battle
din
and
over
the
festive
cheer
so
she
pray
with
clasp
hands
white
and
thin
the
prayer
of
a
soul
absolved
from
sin
for
a
soul
that
is
dark
and
drear
for
the
light
of
repentance
bursting
in
and
the
flood
of
the
blinding
tear
say
priest
when
the
saint
must
vainly
plead
oh
how
shall
the
sinner
fare
i
hold
your
comfort
a
broken
reed
let
the
wither
branch
for
itself
take
heed
while
the
green
shoots
wait
your
care
i
striven
though
feebly
to
grasp
your
creed
and
i
grappled
my
own
despair
by
the
little
within
thee
good
and
brave
not
wholly
shattered
though
shaken
by
the
soul
that
crieth
beyond
the
grave
the
love
that
he
once
in
his
mercy
gave
in
his
mercy
since
retaken
i
conjure
thee
oh
sinner
pardon
crave
i
implore
thee
oh
sleeper
waken
go
to
shall
i
lay
my
black
soul
bare
to
a
vain
man
in
my
sin
in
my
sorrow
you
may
not
share
and
yet
could
i
meet
with
one
who
must
bear
the
load
of
an
equal
ban
with
him
i
might
strive
to
blend
one
prayer
the
wail
of
the
publican
my
son
i
too
am
a
withered
bough
my
place
is
to
others
given
thou
hast
sinn
thou
sayest
i
ask
not
how
for
i
too
have
sinn
even
as
thou
and
i
too
have
feebly
striven
and
with
thee
i
must
bow
crying
us
now
our
father
which
art
in

although
the

still

on

we
sit
between
the

and
push
the

merrily
i
see
you
feasting
round
me
still
all
gay
of

and
strong
of
limb
make
merry

your

the

i

the
voice
of
one
i
heard
the
sunlight
sinks
upon
the
sea
he
sang
as
blythe
as
any
bird
and
shook
the
rafters
with
his
glee
but
times
have
changed
with
him
i
wot
by
fickle
fortune
cross
and
flung
far
stouter
heart
than
mine
he
got
if

he

i
loved
the
sunlight
settles
on
the
sea
long
since
to
distant
climes
he
roved
he
had
his
faults
and
so
have
we
his
name
was
mentioned
here
this
day
and
it
was
coupled
with
a
sneer
i
heard
nor
had
i
aught
to
say
though
once
i
held
his
memory
dear
who
cares
wines
and
fruits
and
flowers
though
death
or
danger
compass
him
he
had
his
faults
and
we
have
ours
the

are
growing

i
miss
the
form
of
one
i
know
the
sunlight
wanes
upon
the

is
not
so
very
long
ago
we
drank
his
health
with
and
we
were
gay
when
he
was

and
he
is
gone
and
we
are
gay
where
has
he
gone
or
far
or

somewhat
hard

the

the

will
censure

there
metal
base
in

vanish
leaving

false

taint
the

still
lurks
in

the

the

on

three

thermopylae

my

that
even
as

we
for
they
like
us
were
mortals
vain
the
slaves
to
earthly
passions
wild
who
slept
with
heaps
of
persians
slain
for
around
them
piled
the

my
festive

somewhat
grim
their

the

the

low
in

the
cedar
toss
her

stood
firm
in

the

through

through

follow

foster

as
firm
as
our
oaks
in
our
pride
as
our
cedars
fair
in
our
sight
we
stand
like
the
trees
of
the
forest
that
brave
the
frosts
and
the
fires
the
storm
went
forth
to
the
forest
the
plague
went
forth
to
the
town
and
the
men
fell
down
to
the
plague
as
the
trees
fell
down
to
the
gale
and
their
bloom
was
a
ghastly
pallor
and
their
smile
was
a
ghastly
frown
and
the
song
of
their
hearts
was
changed
to
a
wild
disconsolate
wail
crying
god
we
have
sinn
we
have
sinn
we
are
bruis
we
are
shorn
we
are
thinn
our
strength
is
turn
to
derision
our
pride
laid
low
in
the
dust
our
cedars
are
cleft
by
thy
lightnings
our
oaks
are
strew
by
thy
wind
and
we
fall
on
our
faces
seeking
thine
aid
though
thy
wrath
is
just
wormwood
and
nightshade
the
troubles
of
life
are
many
the
pleasures
of
life
are
few
when
we
sat
in
the
sunlight
annie
i
dreamt
that
the
skies
were
blue
when
we
sat
in
the
sunlight
annie
i
dreamt
that
the
earth
was
green
there
is
little
colour
if
any
the
sunlight
now
to
be
seen
then
the
rays
of
the
sunset
glinted
through
the
blackwoods
emerald
bough
on
an
emerald
sward
and
spangled
and
gemm
and
now
the
rays
of
the
sunset
redden
with
a
sullen
and
lurid
frown
from
the
skies
that
are
dark
and
leaden
to
earth
that
is
dusk
and
brown
to
right
and
to
left
extended
the
uplands
are
blank
and
drear
and
their
neutral
tints
are
blended
with
the
dead
leaves
sombre
and
sere
the
cold
grey
mist
from
the
still
side
of
the
lake
creeps
sluggish
and
sure
bare
and
bleak
is
the
barren
and
bleak
the
moor
bright
hues
and
shapes
intertwisted
fair
forms
and
rich
colours
now
they
have
flown
if
they
existed
it
matters
not
why
or
how
it
matters
not
where
or
when
dear
they
have
flown
the
blue
and
the
green
i
thought
on
what
might
be
then
dear
now
i
think
on
what
might
have
been
what
might
have
been
words
of
folly
what
might
be
speech
for
a
fool
with
mistletoe
round
me
and
holly
scarlet
and
green
at
yule
with
the
elm
in
the
place
of
the
wattle
and
in
lieu
of
the
gum
the
oak
years
back
i
believed
a
little
and
as
i
believed
i
spoke
have
i
done
with
those
childish
fancies
they
suited
the
days
gone
by
when
i
pulled
the
poppies
and
pansies
when
i
hunted
the
butterfly
with
one
who
has
long
been
sleeping
a
stranger
to
doubts
and
cares
and
to
sowing
that
ends
in
reaping
thistles
and
thorns
and
tares
what
might
be
the
dreams
were
scatter
as
chaff
is
toss
by
the
wind
the
faith
has
been
rudely
shattered
that
listen
with
credence
blind
things
were
to
have
been
and
therefore
they
were
and
they
are
to
be
and
will
be
we
must
prepare
for
the
doom
we
are
bound
to
dree
ah
me
we
believe
in
evil
where
once
we
believed
in
good
the
world
the
flesh
and
the
devil
are
easily
understood
the
world
the
flesh
and
the
devil
their
traces
on
earth
are
plain
must
they
always
riot
and
revel
while
footprints
of
man
remain
talk
about
better
and
wiser
wiser
and
worse
are
one
the
sophist
is
the
despiser
of
all
things
under
the
sun
is
nothing
real
but
confusion
is
nothing
certain
but
death
is
nothing
fair
save
illusion
is
nothing
good
that
has
breath
some
sprite
malignant
and
elfish
seems
present
whispering
close
all
motives
of
life
are
selfish
all
instincts
of
life
are
gross
and
the
song
that
the
poet
fashions
and
the
musical
strain
are
jumbles
of
animal
passions
refined
by
animal
pain
the
restless
throbbings
and
burnings
that
hope
unsatisfied
brings
the
weary
longings
and
yearnings
for
the
mystical
better
things
are
the
sands
on
which
is
reflected
the
pitiless
moving
lake
where
the
wanderer
falls
dejected
by
a
thirst
he
never
can
slake
a
child
blows
bubbles
that
glitter
he
snatches
them
they
disperse
yet
childhood
folly
is
better
and
manhood
folly
is
worse
gilt
baubles
we
grasp
at
blindly
would
turn
in
our
hands
to
dross
is
a
fate
less
cruel
than
kindly
denies
the
gain
and
the
loss
and
as
one
who
pursues
a
shadow
as
one
who
hunts
in
a
dream
as
the
child
who
crosses
the
meadow
enticed
by
the
rainbow
gleam
i
knowing
the
course
was
foolish
and
guessing
the

was

stupid
and

the

the

oh
annie
i
fain
would
recall
the

there
are
others
toiling

straining

graver

mine
they
are

uncomplaining
i

i

i
know
it
how

will
ravage
how

yet
i
long
with
a

savage
i
regret
with

you

no
false

something
is
left

in

the

was
serenely
still

column
that
sailed
from

clay
hung
loitering
long
ere

passed
away
though

wore
a
tinge
of

grey
and
the

was
chill
but
the

sank
to

shroud

behind
a
curtain
of

cloud
with

fringe
of

tempest
soon
when

the
neutral
tint
of

is

sighs
for

dread

double
and
taking
his
leaps
unextended
he
wins
all
the
way
and
the
rest
sweet
they
say
is
the
smell
of
the
plough
friend
but
you
smell
it
too
close
when
it
stops
eyes
and
nose
and
you
ca
tell
your
horse
from
your
cow
friend
part
iii
credat
judaeus
apella
dear
bell
i
enclose
what
you
ask
in
a
letter
a
short
rhyme
at
random
no
more
and
no
less
and
you
may
insert
it
for
want
of
a
better
or
leave
it
it
does
much
matter
i
guess
and
as
for
a
tip
why
there
is
much
in
it
i
may
hit
the
right
nail
but
first
i
declare
i
have
a
notion
what
going
to
win
it
the
champion
i
mean
and
what
more
i
do
care
imprimis
there
cowra
few
nags
can
go
quicker
than
she
can
and
smith
takes
his
oath
she
can
fly
while
brown
jones
and
robinson
swear
she
a
sticker
but
credat
judaeus
apella
say
i
there
old
volunteer
i
be
sorry
to
sneer
at
his
chance
he
be
there
if
he
goes
at
the
rate
he
went
at
last
year
when
a
customer
queer
johnny
higgerson
fancied
him
lock
in
the
straight
i
heard
that
the
old
horse
has
never
been
fitter
i
heard
all
performances
past
he
outvie
he
may
gallop
a
docker
and
finish
a
splitter
but
credat
judaeus
apella
say
i
know
what
they
say
sir
the
hook
he
can
stay
sir
and
stick
to
his
work
like
a
or
beagle
he
stays
with
a
hook
and
he
sticks
in
the
clay
sir
i
rather
for
choice
pop
my
money
on
seagull
i
told
that
the
sydney
division
will
rue
sir
their
rashness
in
front
of
the
stand
when
they
spy
with
a
clear
lead
the
white
jacket
spotted
with
blue
sir
but
credat
judaeus
apella
say
i
there
the
barb
you
may
talk
of
your
flyers
and
stayers
all
bosh
when
he
strips
you
can
see
his
eye
range
round
his
rivals
with
much
the
same
look
as
tom
sayers
once
wore
when
he
faced
the
big
novice
bill
bainge
like
stow
at
our
hustings
confronting
the
hisses
of
roughs
with
his
queer
mephistopheles
smile
like
baker
or
baker
more
wonderful
the
terror
of
blacks
at
the
source
of
the
nile
like
triton
minnows
like
hawk
among
chickens
like
anything
better
than
everything
else
he
stands
at
the
post
now
they
off
the
plot
thickens
quoth
stanley
to
davis
how
is
your
pulse
he
skims
the
smooth
turf
he
scuds
through
the
mire
he
waits
with
them
passes
them
bids
them
two
miles
and
cries
filgate
he
tire
oh
credat
judaeus
apella
say
i
lest
my
tale
should
come
true
let
me
give
you
fair
warning
you
may
shout
some
cheroots
if
you
like
no
champagne
for
this
child
oh
think
of
my
head
in
the
morning
old
chap
you
do
get
me
on
that
lay
again
the
last
time
those
games
i
look
likely
to
try
on
says
bradshawe
you
feel
very
sheepish
and
shy
when
you
are
haul
up
and
caution
by
d
g
y
and
l
n
oh
credat
judaeus
apella
say
i
this
writing
bad
verses
is
very
fatiguing
the
brain
and
the
liver
against
it
combine
and
nerves
with
digestion
in
concert
are
leaguing
to
punish
excess
in
the
pen
and
ink
line
already
i
feel
just
as
if
i
been
rowing
hard
all
on
a
supper
of
onions
and
tripe
a
thing
i
abhor
but
my
steam
i
done
blowing
i
am
my
dear
bell
yours
truly
the
pipe
tell
if
he
fancies
a
good
that
old
chestnut
pony
of
mine
is
for
sale
his
forelegs
are
uncommonly
wooden
i
fancy
the
near
one
beginning
to
fail
and
why
should
i
do
as
w
n
does
oft
and
swear
that
a
cripple
is
sound
on
the
bible
hold
hard
though
the
man
i
allude
to
is
soft

game
to
go
in
for
an
action
of

part
iv

dream
of
chases
and
courses
dogs
dream
so
do
horses
last
night
i
was
dozing
and
dreaming
the
crowd
and
the
bustle
were
there
and
the
rustle
of
the
silk
in
the
autumn
sky
gleaming
the
stand
throng
with
faces
the
broadcloth
and
laces
the
booths
and
the
tents
and
the
cars
the
bookmakers
jargon
for
odds
making
bargain
the
nasty
stale
smell
of
cigars
we
formed
into
line
the
merry
sunshine
near
the
logs
at
the
end
of
the
railing
are
you
ready
boys
go
cried
the
starter
and
low
sank
the
flag
and
away
we
went
sailing
in
the
van
of
the
battle
we
heard
the
stones
rattle
some
slogging
was
done
but
no
slaughter
a
shout
from
the
stand
and
the
whole
of
our
band
skimm
merrily
over
the
water
two
fences
we
clear
and
the
roadway
we
near
when
three
of
our
troop
came
to
trouble
like
a
bird
on
the
wing
or
a
stone
from
a
sling
flew
cadger
first
over
the
double
and
western
was
there
head
and
tail
in
the
air
and
pondon
was
there
too
what
noodle
could
so
name
a
horse
i
should
feel
some
remorse
if
i
gave
such
a
name
to
a
poodle
in
and
out
of
the
lane
to
the
racecourse
again
craig
pony
was
first
i
was
third
and
ingleside
lit
in
my
tracks
with
the
bit
in
his
teeth
and
came
up
like
a
bird
in
the
van
of
the
battle
we
heard
the
rails
rattle
says
he
though
i
do
care
for
shunning
my
share
of
the
raps
i
shall
look
out
for
gaps
when
the
light
weight
away
with
the
running
at
the
fence
just
ahead
the
outsider
still
led
the
chestnut
play
follow
my
leader
oh
the
devil
a
gap
he
went
into
it
slap
and
he
and
his
jock
took
a
header
says
ingleside
mate
should
the
pony
go
straight
you
no
time
to
stop
or
turn
restive
says
i
who
means
to
stop
i
shall
go
till
i
drop
says
he
go
it
old
cuss
gay
and
festive
the
fence
stiff
and
tall
just
beyond
the
log
wall
we
cross
and
the
walls
and
the
water
i
took
off
too
near
a
small
made
fence
to
clear
and
just
touch
the
grass
with
my
snorter
at
the
next
post
and
rail
up
went
western
bang
tail
and
down
by
the
very
same
token
to
earth
went
his
nose
for
the
panel
he
chose
stood
firm
and
refused
to
be
broken
i
dreamt
someone
said
that
the
bay
would
have
made
the
race
safe
if
he
stood
a
while
longer
if
he
had
but
like
if
there
the
panel
stands
stiff
he
stood
but
the
panel
stood
stronger
in
and
out
of
the
road
with
a
clear
lead
still
the
violet
fluted
with
amber
says
johnson
old
man
catch
him
now
if
you
can
is
the
second
time
round
you
remember
at
the
road
once
again
pulling
hard
on
the
rein
craig
pony
popp
in
and
popp
out
i
followed
like
smoke
and
the
pace
was
no
joke
for
his
friends
were
beginning
to
shout
and
ingleside
came
to
my
side
strong
and
game
and
once
he
appear
to
outstrip
me
but
i
felt
the
steel
gore
and
i
shot
to
the
fore
only
cadger
seem
likely
to
whip
me
in
the
van
of
the
battle
i
heard
the
logs
rattle
his
stroke
never
seem
to
diminish
and
thrice
i
drew
near
him
and
thrice
he
drew
clear
for
the
weight
served
him
well
at
the
finish
ha
cadger
goes
down
see
he
stands
on
his
crown
those
rails
take
a
power
of
clouting
a
long
sliding
blunder
he
up
well
i
wonder
if
now
it
all
over
but
shouting
all
loosely
he
striding
the
amateur
riding
all
loosely
some
reverie
locked
in
of
a
vision
in
smoke
or
a
wayfaring
bloke
his
poetical
rubbish
concocting
now
comes
from
afar
the
faint
cry
here
they
are
the
violet
winning
with
ease
fred
goes
up
like
a
shot
does
he
catch
him
or
not
level
money
i
take
the
cerise
to
his
haunches
i
spring
and
my
muzzle
i
bring
to
his
flank
to
his
girth
to
his
shoulder
through
the
shouting
and
yelling
i
hear
my
name
swelling
the
hearts
of
my
backers
grow
bolder
neck
and
neck
head
and
head
staring
eye
nostril
spread
girth
and
stifle
laid
close
to
the
ground
stride
for
stride
stroke
for
stroke
through
one
hurdle
we
broke
on
the
splinters
we
lit
with
one
bound
and
banker
for
choice
is
the
cry
and
one
voice
screams
six
to
four
once
upon
banker
banker
wins
banker
beat
cadger
wins
a
dead
heat
ah
there
goes
fred
whalebone
a
flanker
springs
the
whip
with
a
crack
nine
stone
ten
on
his
back
fit
and
light
he
can
race
like
the
devil
i
draw
past
him
is
vain
he
draws
past
me
again
springs
the
whip
and
again
we
are
level
steel
and
cord
do
their
worst
now
my
head
struggles
first
that
tug
my
last
spurt
has
expended
nose
to
nose
lip
to
lip
from
the
sound
of
the
whip
he
strains
to
the
utmost
extended
how
they
swim
through
the
air
as
we
roll
to
the
chair
stand
faces
and
railings
flit
past
now
i
spring
from
my
lair
with
a
snort
and
a
stare
rous
by
fred
with
my
supper
at
last
part
v
ex

the
cup
and
the
lip
prologue
calm
and
clear
the
bright
day
is
declining
the
crystal
expanse
of
the
bay
like
a
shield
of
pure
metal
lies
shining
headlands
of
purple
and
grey
while
the
little
waves
leap
in
the
sunset
and
strike
with
a
miniature
shock
in
sportive
and
infantine
onset
the
base
of
the
rock
calm
and
clear
the
are
laden
with
a
fragrance
a
freshness
a
power
with
a
song
like
the
song
of
a
maiden
with
a
scent
like
the
scent
of
a
flower
and
a
whisper
comes
home
with
the
sigh
of
the
surf
but
i
pause
for
your
fancies
poetic
never
rise
from
the
level
of
turf
of
mine
in
public
performances
past
in
trials
whence
touts
take
their
winner
in
rumours
that
circulate
fast
in
strains
from
prunella
or
priam
staying
stayers
or
goers
that
go
you
much
better
posted
than
i
am
is
little
i
care
less
i
know
alas
neither
poet
nor
prophet
am
i
though
a
jingler
of
rhymes
is
a
hobby
of
mine
and
i
off
it
at
times
and
i
on
it
at
times
and
whether
i
off
it
or
on
it
your
readers
my
counsels
will
shun
since
i
scarce
know
van
tromp
from
blue
bonnet
though
i
might
know
cigar
from
the
nun
with
visions
you
ought
to
be
sated
and
sicken
by
this
time
i
swear
that
mine
are
all
myths
air
visions
that
vanish
in
air
if
i
had
some
loose
coins
i
might
chuck
one
to
settle
this
question
and
say
here
goes
this
is
tails
for
the
black
one
and
heads
for
my
the

and
must
i
rob
paul
to
pay
peter
or
peter
defraud

my
rhymes
are
they
stale
if
my
metre
is
varied
one
chime
rings
through
all
one
chime
though
i
sing
more
or
sing
less
i
have
but
one
string
to
my
lute
and
it
might
have
been
better
if
stringless
and
songless
the
same
had
been
mute
yet
not
as
a
seer
of
visions
nor
yet
as
a
dreamer
of
dreams
i
send
you
these
partial
decisions
on
hackney
impoverish
themes
but
with
song
out
of
tune
sung
to
pass
time
flung
heedless
to
friends
or
to
foes
where
the
false
notes
that
ring
for
the
last
time
may
blend
with
some
real
ones
who
knows
the
race
on
the
hill
they
are
crowding
together
in
the
stand
they
are
crushing
for
room
like
they
swarm
on
the
heather
they
gather
like
bees
on
the
broom
they
flutter
like
moths
round
a
candle
stale
similes
granted
what
then
i
got
a
stale

a

stale

the

your

they

tait
colours
are
struck
and
the
green
in
the

and
the

wax

is
it
tamworth

either

as
the

through

by

as

through
yon

dashes
clad

from

the

of
the

past

the

giving
way
on

past
tamworth
who
feels
the

smite
and
whose
sides
by

rowels
are
cleft
where
tim

the

together
still
bear
of

the

away
unextended
hard

epilogue
he

yes
he
wins
upon
paper
he
has
yet
won
upon

and
these
rhymes
are
but
moonshine
and
vapour
and
spume
from
the

so
be
it
at
least
they
are
given
free
gratis
for
just
what
they
worth
and
whatever
there
may
be
in

there
little
worth
much
upon

when
with
satellites
round
them
the
centre
of
all
eyes
hard
press
by
the
crowd
the
pair
horse
and
rider
the
gate
a
shout
long
and
loud
you
may
feel
as
you
might
feel
just
landed
full
length
on
the
grass
from
the
clip
of
a
vicious
or
whizzing
from
hip
and
that
not
so
bad
if
you
pick
up
discreetly
and
carefully
nursed
loose
teeth
by
the
sponge
are
soon
lick
up
and
next
time
you
may
get
home
first
still
i
not
sure
you
like
it
exactly
such
tastes
as
a
rule
are
acquired
and
you
find
in
a
nutshell
this
fact
lie
bruised
optics
are
not
much
admired
do
i
bore
you
with
vulgar
allusions
forgive
me
i
speak
as
i
feel
i
pondered
and
made
my
conclusions
as
the
mill
grinds
the
corn
to
the
meal
so
man
striving
boldly
but
blindly
ground
piecemeal
in
destiny
mill
at
his
best
taking
punishment
kindly
is
only
a
still
are
we
wise
our
abstruse
calculations
are
based
on
experience
long
are
we
sanguine
our
high
expectations
are
founded
on
hope
that
is
strong
thus
we
build
an
that
crumbles
and
drifts
till
no
traces
remain
and
the
fool
builds
again
while
he
grumbles
and
the
wise
one
laughs
building
again
how
came
they
to
pass
these
rash
blunders
these
false
steps
so
hard
to
defend
our
friend
puts
the
question
and
wonders
we
laugh
and
reply
ah
my

the

falsely
taken
the

misjudged

it

you

the

where
is
the
pyrrhic
phalanx
gone
of
two
such
lessons
why
forget
the
nobler
and
the

one
byron
one
line
of
swart
profiles
and
bearded
lips
dressing
one
ridge
of
bright
helmets
one
crest
of
fair
plumes
one
streak
of
blue
all
bared
for
the
fleshing
one
row
of
red
nostrils
that
scent
forward
the
trumpets
were
sounding
the
charge
the
roll
of
the
kettledrum
rapidly
ran
that
music
like
spreading
at
large
madden
the
as
well
as
the
man
forward
still
forward
we
thunder
along
steadily
yet
for
our
strength
we
were
nursing
tall
ewart
our
sergeant
was
humming
a
song
black
will
was
blaspheming
and
cursing
open
their
volley
of
guns
on
our
right
puffs
of
grey
smoke
veiling
gleams
of
red
flame
curling
to
leeward
were
seen
on
the
height
where
the
batteries
were
posted
as
onward
we
came
spreading
before
us
their
cavalry
lay
squadron
on
squadron
troop
upon
troop
we
were
so
few
and
so
many
were
they
eagles
wait
calmly
the
stoop
forward
still
forward
steed
answering
steed
cheerily
neigh
while
the
foam
flakes
were
from
bridle
to
bridle
the
top
of
our
speed
was
gain
but
the
pride
of
our
order
was
lost
one
was
there
leading
by
nearly
a
rood
though
we
were
racing
he
kept
to
the
fore
still
as
a
rock
in
his
stirrups
he
stood
high
in
the
sunlight
his
sabre
he
bore
suddenly
tottering
backwards
he
crash
loudly
his
helm
right
in
front
of
us
rung
iron
hoofs
thunder
and
naked
steel
over
him
youngest
where
many
were
young
now
we
were
close
to
them
every
horse
striding
madly
luce
pass
with
never
a
groan
sadly
my
master
look
round
he
was
riding
on
the
boy
right
with
a
line
of
his
own
thrusting
his
hand
in
his
breast
or
while
from
his
wrist
the
sword
swung
by
a
chain
swiftly
he
drew
out
some
trinket
or
locket
kiss
it
i
think
and
replaced
it
again
burst
while
his
fingers
reclosed
on
the
haft
jarring
concussion
and
earth
shaking
din
horse
horse
and
i
reel
but
he
laugh
down
went
his
man
cloven
clean
to
the
chin
wedged
in
the
midst
of
that
struggling
mass
after
the
first
shock
where
each
his
foe
singled
little
was
seen
save
a
dazzle
like
glass
in
the
sun
with
grey
smoke
and
black
dust
intermingled
here
and
there
redden
a
pistol
shot
flashing
through
the
red
sparkle
of
steel
upon
steel
redder
the
spark
seem
and
louder
the
clashing
struck
from
the
helm
by
the
heel
over
fallen
riders
like
wither
leaves
strewing
uplands
in
autumn
we
sunder
their
ranks
steeds
rearing
and
plunging
men
hacking
and
hewing
fierce
grinding
of
sharp
goading
of
flanks
short
was
the
crisis
of
conflict
soon
over
being
too
good
i
suppose
to
last
long
through
them
we
cut
as
the
scythe
cuts
the
clover
batter
and
stain
we
emerg
from
their
throng
some
of
our
saddles
were
emptied
of

or
elsewhere

riderless
horse
his

being
hurt
while
ten
seconds
we
tarried
and
then
we
and
went
at
them
once
more
and
ere
they
had
rightly
closed
up
the
old
track
we
broke
through
the
lane
we
had
open
before
and
as
we
went
forward
so
we
came
back
our
numbers
were
few
and
our
loss
far
from
small
they
could
fight
and
besides
they
were
twenty
to
one
we
were
clear
of
them
all
when
we
heard
the
recall
and
thus
we
returned
but
my
tale
is
not
done
for
the
hand
of
my
rider
felt
strange
on
my
bit
he
breathed
once
or
twice
like
one
partially
choked
and
sway
in
his
seat
then
i
knew
he
was
hit
he
must
have
bled
fast
for
my
withers
were
soak
and
scarcely
an
inch
of
my
housing
was
dry
i
slacken
my
speed
yet
i
never
quite
stopp
ere
he
patted
my
neck
said
old
fellow
and
dropp
off
me
gently
and
lay
where
he
dropp
ah
me
after
all
they
may
call
us
dumb
creatures
i
tried
hard
to
neigh
but
the
sobs
took
my
breath
yet
i
guess
gazing
down
at
those
still
quiet
features
he
was
never
more
happy
in
life
than
in
death
two
years
back
at
aldershot
elrington
mentioned
my
name
to
our
colonel
one
he
said

ought
to
be

count
died
the
same
week
and
now
steeltrap
is
dead
that
morning
our

was
riding
theresa
the

by
teddington
out
of
mistake
his
girls
pretty
alice
and
louisa
were
there
on
the
ponies
he
purchased
from
blake
i
remember
he
pointed
me
out
to
his
daughters
said
he
in
this
troop
i
may
fairly
take
pride
but
i
none
left
like
him
in
my
officers
quarters
whose
the
mane
of
old
dyed
where
are

the
who
shared
in
our
glory
the

but
faster

all
vanish
what
wonder
twelve
summers
have
since
then
and
my

lies
buried
this
day
old

and
now
i
the

of
the

who
shared
in
that

when
you

as
i
have
you
wo
mind
the

in

our
gallant
old
colonel
came
limping
and
halting
the
day
before
yesterday
into
my
stall
oh
light
to
the
saddle
i
once
seen
him
vaulting
in
full
marching
order
steel
broadsword
and
all
and
now
his
left
leg
than
his
right
is
made
shorter
three
inches
he
stoops
and
his
chest
is
unsound
he
spoke
to
me
gently
and
patted
my
quarter
i
laid
my
ears
back
and
look
playfully
round
for
that
word
kindly
meant
that
caress
kindly
given
i
thank
him
though
dumb
but
my
cheerfulness
fled
more
sadness
i
drew
from
the
face
of
the
living
than
years
back
i
did
from
the
face
of
the
dead
for
the
dead
face
upturn
tranquil
joyous
and
fearless
look
straight
from
green
sod
to
blue
fathomless
sky
with
a
smile
but
the
living
face
gloomy
and
tearless
and
haggard
and
harass
look
down
with
a
sigh
did
he
think
on
the
first
time
he
kiss
lady
mary
on
the
morning
he
wing
horace
greville
the
beau
on
the
winner
he
steer
in
the
grand
military
on
the
charge
that
he
headed
twelve
long
years
ago
did
he
think
on
each
fresh
year
of
fresh
grief
the
herald
on
lids
that
are
sunken
and
locks
that
are
grey
on
alice
who
bolted
with
brian
fitzgerald
on
rupert
his
dishonour
by
play
on
louey
his
darling
who
sleeps
the
cypress
that
shades
her
and
one
whose
last
breath
gave
her
life
i
saw
those
strong
fingers
hard
over
each
eye
press
oh
the
dead
rest
in
peace
when
the
quick
toil
in
strife

with
us
the
wide
gulf
that
parts
us
may
yet
be
no
wider
than
that
which
parts
you
from
some
being
more
blest
and
there
may
be
more

the
horse
and
his
rider
than
ever
your
shallow
philosophy
guess
you
are
proud
of
your

vain

though
your

you
extol
and
our

you
disparage
your

your

your

we
felt
we
too
sprung
from
mares
of
the
prophet
of

nursed
on

that
was
born
with

of

we
glory
in
daring
that
dies
or
prevails
from
of
squadrons
and

to

the
blended
with
the
furious

at
the

the
terrible
shock
the
recoil
and
the
splendid
bare
sword
flashing

from
the
blow
i
borne
one
through
perils
where
many
have
seen
us
no

yet
rhyme
had
not
fail
me
for
reason
nor
reason
for
rhyme
sweet
song
had
i
sought
you
in
season
and
found
you
in
time
you
beckon
in
your
bright
beauty
yonder
and
i
waxing
fainter
yet
fonder
now
weary
too
soon
when
i
wander
now
fall
when
i
climb
it
matters
but
little
in
the
long
run
the
weak
have
some
right
some
share
in
the
race
that
the
strong
run
the
fight
the
strong
fight
if
words
that
are
worthless
go
westward
yet
the
worst
word
shall
be
as
the
best
word
in
the
day
when
all
riot
sweeps
restward
in
darkness
or
light
the
sick
stockrider
hold
hard
ned
lift
me
down
once
more
and
lay
me
in
the
shade
old
man
you
had
your
work
cut
out
to
guide
both
horses
and
to
hold
me
in
the
saddle
when
i
sway
all
through
the
hot
slow
sleepy
silent
ride
the
dawn
at
moorabinda
was
a
mist
rack
dull
and
dense
the
sunrise
was
a
sullen
sluggish
lamp
i
was
dozing
in
the
gateway
at
arbuthnot
fence
i
was
dreaming
on
the
limestone
cattle
camp
we
crossed
the
creek
at
carricksford
and
sharply
through
the
haze
and
suddenly
the
sun
shot
flaming
forth
to
southward
lay
katawa
with
the
sandpeaks
all
ablaze
and
the
flush
fields
of
glen
lomond
lay
to
north
now
westward
winds
the
bridle
path
that
leads
to
lindisfarm
and
yonder
looms
the
bluff
from
the
far
side
of
the
first
hill
when
the
skies
are
clear
and
calm
you
can
see
sylvester
woolshed
fair
enough
five
miles
we
used
to
call
it
from
our
homestead
to
the
place
where
the
big
tree
spans
the
roadway
like
an
arch
was
here
we
ran
the
dingo
down
that
gave
us
such
a
chase
eight
years
ago
or
was
it
nine
last
march
was
merry
in
the
glowing
morn
among
the
gleaming
grass
to
wander
as
we
wandered
many
a
mile
and
blow
the
cool
tobacco
cloud
and
watch
the
white
wreaths
pass
sitting
loosely
in
the
saddle
all
the
while
was
merry
the
blackwoods
when
we
spied
the
station
roofs
to
wheel
the
wild
scrub
cattle
at
the
yard
with
a
running
fire
of
stockwhips
and
a
fiery
run
of
hoofs
oh
the
hardest
day
was
never
then
too
hard
aye
we
had
a
glorious
gallop
after
starlight
and
his
gang
when
they
bolted
from
sylvester
on
the
flat
how
the
crackled
how
the
ranges
rang
to
the
strokes
of
mountaineer
and
acrobat
hard
behind
them
in
the
timber
harder
still
across
the
heath
close
beside
them
through
the
scrub
we
dash
and
the
fern
leaves
how
they
rustled
underneath
and
the
honeysuckle
osiers
how
they
crash
we
led
the
hunt
throughout
ned
on
the
chestnut
and
the
grey
and
the
troopers
were
three
hundred
yards
behind
while
we
emptied
our
on
the
bushrangers
at
bay
in
the
creek
with
stunted
for
a
blind
there
you
grappled
with
the
leader
man
to
man
and
horse
to
horse
and
you
roll
together
when
the
chestnut
rear
he
blazed
away
and
missed
you
in
that
shallow
watercourse
a
narrow
shave
his
powder
singed
your
beard
in
these
hours
when
life
is
ebbing
how
those
days
when
life
was
young
come
back
to
us
how
clearly
i
recall
even
the
yarns
jack
hall
invented
and
the
songs
jem
roper
sung
and
where
are
now
jem
roper
and
jack
hall
aye
nearly
all
our
comrades
of
the
old
colonial
school
our
ancient
boon
companions
ned
are
gone
hard
livers
for
the
most
part
somewhat
reckless
as
a
rule
it
seems
that
you
and
i
are
left
alone
there
was
hughes
who
got
in
trouble
through
that
business
with
the
cards
it
matters
little
what
became
of
him
but
a
steer
ripp
up
macpherson
in
the
cooraminta
yards
and
sullivan
was
drown
at
and
mostyn
poor
frank
mostyn
died
at
last
a
fearful
wreck
in
the
horrors
at
the
upper
wandinong
and
carisbrooke
the
rider
at
the
horsefall
broke
his
neck
faith
the
wonder
was
he
saved
his
neck
so
long
ah
those
days
and
nights
we
squandered
at
the
logans
in
the
glen
the
logans
man
and
wife
have
long
been
dead
elsie
tallest
girl
seems
taller
than
your
little
elsie
then
and
ethel
is
a
woman
grown
and
wed
i
had
my
share
of
pastime
and
i
done
my
share
of
toil
and
life
is
short
the
longest
life
a
span
i
care
not
now
to
tarry
for
the
corn
or
for
the
oil
or
for
the
wine
that
maketh
glad
the
heart
of
man
for
good
undone
and
gifts
misspent
and
resolutions
vain
is
somewhat
late
to
trouble
this
i
know
i
should
live
the
same
life
over
if
i
had
to
live
again
and
the
chances
are
i
go
where
most
men
go
the
deep
blue
skies
wax
dusky
and
the
tall
green
trees
grow
dim
the
sward
beneath
me
seems
to
heave
and
fall
and
sickly
smoky
shadows
through
the
sleepy
sunlight
swim
and
on
the
very
sun
face
weave
their
pall
let
me
slumber
in
the
hollow
where
the
wattle
blossoms
wave
with
never
stone
or
rail
to
fence
my
bed
should
the
sturdy
station
children
pull
the
bush
flowers
on
my
grave
i
may
chance
to
hear
them
romping
overhead
the
swimmer
with
short
sharp
violent
lights
made
vivid
to
southward
far
as
the
sight
can
roam
only
the
swirl
of
the
surges
livid
the
seas
that
climb
and
the
surfs
that
comb
only
the
crag
and
the
cliff
to
and
the
rocks
receding
and
reefs
flung
forward
and
waifs
wreck
seaward
and
wasted
shoreward
on
shallows
sheeted
with
flaming
foam
a
grim
grey
coast
and
a
seaboard
ghastly
and
shores
trod
seldom
by
feet
of
men
where
the
batter
hull
and
the
broken
mast
lie
they
have
lain
embedded
these
long
years
ten
love
when
we
wander
here
together
hand
in
hand
through
the
sparkling
weather
from
the
heights
and
hollows
of
fern
and
heather
god
surely
loved
us
a
little
then
the
skies
were
fairer
and
shores
were
firmer
the
blue
sea
over
the
bright
sand
roll
babble
and
prattle
and
ripple
and
murmur
sheen
of
silver
and
glamour
of
gold
and
the
sunset
bath
in
the
gulf
to
lend
her
a
garland
of
pinks
and
of
purples
tender
a
tinge
of
the
rosy
splendour
a
tithe
of
his
glories
manifold
man
works
are
graven
cunning
and
skilful
on
earth
where
his
tabernacles
are
but
the
sea
is
wanton
the
sea
is
wilful
and
who
shall
mend
her
and
who
shall
mar
shall
we
carve
success
or
record
disaster
on
the
bosom
of
her
heaving
alabaster
will
her
purple
pulse
beat
fainter
or
faster
for
fallen
sparrow
or
fallen
star
i
would
that
with
sleepy
soft
embraces
the
sea
would
fold
me
would
find
me
rest
in
luminous
shades
of
her
secret
places
in
depths
where
her
marvels
are
manifest
so
the
earth
beneath
her
should
not
discover
my
hidden
couch
nor
the
heaven
above
her
as
a
strong
love
shielding
a
weary
lover
i
would
have
her
shield
me
with
shining
breast
when
light
in
the
realms
of
space
lay
hidden
when
life
was
yet
in
the
womb
of
time
ere
flesh
was
fettered
to
fruits
forbidden
and
souls
were
wedded
to
care
and
crime
was
the
course
foreshaped
for
the
future
spirit
a
burden
of
folly
a
void
of
merit
that
would
fain
the
wisdom
of
stars
inherit
and
can
not
fathom
the
seas
sublime
under
the
sea
or
the
soil
what
matter
the
sea
and
the
soil
are
under
the
sun
as
in
the
former
days
in
the
latter
the
sleeping
or
waking
is
known
of
none
surely
the
sleeper
shall
not
awaken
to
griefs
forgotten
or
joys
forsaken
for
the
price
of
all
things
given
and
taken
the
sum
of
all
things
done
and
undone
shall
we
count
offences
or
coin
excuses
or
weigh
with
scales
the
soul
of
a
man
whom
a
strong
hand
binds
and
a
sure
hand
looses
whose
light
is
a
spark
and
his
life
a
span
the
seed
he
sow
or
the
soil
he
cumber
the
time
he
served
or
the
space
he
slumber
will
it
profit
a
man
when
his
days
are
number
or
his
deeds
since
the
days
of
his
life
began
one
glad
because
of
the
light
saith
shall
not
the
righteous
judge
of
all
the
earth
do
right
for
behold
the
sparrows
on
the
fall
not
save
as
seemeth
to
him
good
in
his
sight
and
this
man
joy
shall
have
no
abiding
through
lights
departing
and
lives
dividing
he
is
soon
as
one
in
the
darkness
hiding
one
loving
darkness
rather
than
light
a
little
season
of
love
and
laughter
of
light
and
life
and
pleasure
and
pain
and
a
horror
of
outer
darkness
after
and
dust
returneth
to
dust
again
then
the
lesser
life
shall
be
as
the
greater
and
the
lover
of
life
shall
join
the
hater
and
the
one
thing
cometh
sooner
or
later
and
no
one
knoweth
the
loss
or
gain
love
of
my
life
we
had
lights
in
season
hard
to
part
from
harder
to
keep
we
had
strength
to
labour
and
souls
to
reason
and
seed
to
scatter
and
fruits
to
reap
though
time
estranges
and
fate
disperses
we
have
had
our
loves
and
our
loving
mercies
though
the
gifts
of
the
light
in
the
end
are
curses
yet
bides
the
gift
of
the
darkness
sleep
see
girt
with
tempest
and
wing
with
thunder
and
clad
with
lightning
and
shod
with
sleet
the
strong
winds
treading
the
swift
waves
sunder
the
flying
rollers
with
frothy
feet
one
gleam
like
a
bloodshot
swims
on
the
staining
the
green
gulf
crimson
a
death
stroke
fiercely
dealt
by
a
dim
sun
that
strikes
through
his
stormy
oh
brave
white
horses
you
gather
and
gallop
the
storm
sprite
loosens
the
gusty
reins
now
the
stoutest
ship
were
the
frailest
shallop
in
your
hollow
backs
or
your
high
arch
manes
i
would
ride
as
never
a

has
ridden
in
your
sleepy
swirling
surges

to
gulfs

through
straits
forbidden
where
no

wearies
and
no

wanes
from

turn
out
boys
what
up
with
our
super
the
man
mad
two
hours
to
daybreak
i
swear
stark
mad
why
there
is
a
glimmer
of
light
take
bolingbroke
alec
give
jack
the
young
mare
look
sharp
a
large
vessel
lies
jamm
on
the
reef
and
many
on
board
still
and
some
wash
on
shore
ride
straight
with
the
news
they
may
send
some
relief
from
the
township
and
we
we
can
do
little
more
you
alec
you
know
the
near
cuts
you
can
cross
sugarloaf
ford
with
a
scramble
i
think
do
spare
the
blood
filly
nor
yet
the
black
horse
should
the
wind
rise
god
help
them
the
ship
will
soon
sink
old
peter
away
down
the
paddock
to
drive
the
nags
to
the
stockyard
as
fast
as
he
can
a
life
and
death
matter
so
lads
look
alive
in
the
dark
to
the
stockyard
we
ran
there
was
bridling
with
hurry
and
saddling
with
haste
confusion
and
cursing
for
lack
of
a
moon
be
quick
with
these
buckles
we
no
time
to
waste
mind
the
mare
she
can
use
her
hind
legs
to
some
tune
make
sure
of
the
strike
the
old
track
they
fenced
off
the
new
one
look
out
for
the
holes
on
the
wombat
hills
down
with
the
slip
rails
stand
back
and
ride
boys
the
pair
of
you
ride
for
your
souls
in
the
low
branches
heavily
laden
with
dew
in
the
long
grasses
spoiling
with
deadwood
that
day
where
the
blackwood
the
box
and
the
bastard
oak
grew
between
the
tall
we
gallop
away
we
crash
through
a
brush
fence
we
splash
through
a
swamp
we
steered
for
the
north
near
the
eaglehawk
nest
we
bore
to
the
left
just
beyond
the
red
camp
and
round
the
black
belt
wheel
to
the
west
we
cross
a
low
range
sickly
scented
with
musk
from
blossom
we
skirted
a
marsh
then
the
dawn
faintly
dappled
with
orange
the
dusk
and
peal
overhead
the
jay
laughter
note
harsh
and
shot
the
first
sunstreak
behind
us
and
soon
the
dim
dewy
uplands
were
dreamy
with
light
and
full
on
our
left
flash
the
reedy
lagoon
and
sharply
the
sugarloaf
rear
on
our
right
a
smothered
curse
broke
through
the
bushman
brown
beard
he
turn
in
his
saddle
his
cheek
flush
feebly
with
sundawn
said
just
what
i
fear
last
fortnight
late
rainfall
has
flooded
the
creek
black
bolingbroke
snorted
and
stood
on
the
brink
one
instant
then
deep
in
the
dark
sluggish
swirl
plunged
headlong
i
saw
the
horse
suddenly
sink
till
round
the
man
armpits
the
waves
seemed
to
curl
we
follow
one
cold
shock
and
deeper
we
sank
than
they
did
and
twice
tried
the
landing
in
vain
the
third
struggle
won
it
straight
up
the
steep
bank
we
stagger
then
out
on
the
skirts
of
the
plain
the
stockrider
alec
at
starting
had
got
the
lead
and
had
kept
it
throughout
was
his
boast
that
through
thickest
of
scrub
he
could
steer
like
a
shot
and
the
black
horse
was
counted
the
best
on
the
coast
the
mare
had
been
awkward
enough
in
the
dark
she
was
eager
and
headstrong
and
barely
half
broke
she
had
had
me
too
close
to
a
big
and
had
made
a
near
thing
of
a
crooked
sheoak
but
now
on
the
open
lit
up
by
the
morn
she
flung
the
white
from
nostril
to
neck
and
chased
him
i
hatless
with
shirt
sleeves
all
torn
for
he
may
ride
ragged
who
rides
from
a
wreck
and
faster
and
faster
across
the
wide
heath
we
rode
till
we
raced
then
i
gave
her
her
head
and
she
stretching
out
with
the
bit
in
her
teeth
she
caught
him
outpaced
him
and
passed
him
and
led
we
neared
the
new
fence
we
were
wide
of
the
track
i
look
right
and
left
she
had
never
been
tried
at
a
stiff
leap
was
little
he
cared
on
the
black
you
more
than
a
mile
from
the
gateway
he
cried
i
hung
to
her
head
touched
her
flank
with
the
spurs
in
the
red
streak
of
rail
not
the
ghost
of
a
gap
she
shortened
her
long
stroke
she
pricked
her
sharp
ears
she
flung
it
behind
her
with
hardly
a
rap
i
saw
the
post
quiver
where
bolingbroke
struck
and
guessed
that
the
pace
we
had
come
the
last
mile
had
blown
him
a
bit
he
could
jump
like
a
buck
we
galloped
more
steadily
then
for
a
while
the
heath
was
soon
pass
in
the
dim
distance
lay
the
mountain
the
sun
was
just
clearing
the
tips
of
the
ranges
to
eastward
the
mare
could
she
stay
she
was
bred
very
nearly
as
clean
as
eclipse
she
led
and
as
oft
as
he
came
to
her
side
she
took
the
bit
free
and
untiring
as
yet
her
neck
was
arched
double
her
nostrils
were
wide
and
the
tips
of
her
tapering
ears
nearly
met
you
lighter
than
i
am
said
alec
at
last
the
horse
is
dead
beat
and
the
mare
is
blown
she
must
be
a
good
one
ride
on
and
ride
fast
you
know
your
way
now
so
i
rode
on
alone
still
galloping
forward
we
pass
the
two
flocks
at
hut
and
hill
she
was
galloping
strong
at
the
warrigal
rocks
on
the
wallaby
range
she
was
galloping
still
and
over
the
wasteland
and
under
the
wood
by
down
and
by
dale
and
by
fell
and
by
flat
she
gallop
and
here
in
the
stirrups
i
stood
to
ease
her
and
there
in
the
saddle
i
sat
to
steer
her
we
suddenly
struck
the
red
loam
of
the
track
near
the
troughs
then
she
reeled
on
the
rise
from
her
crest
to
her
croup
covered
over
with
foam
and
her
nostrils
and
bloodshot
her
eyes
a
dip
in
the
dell
where
the
wattle
fire
bloomed
a
bend
round
a
bank
that
had
shut
out
the
view
large
framed
in
the
mild
light
the
mountain
had
loomed
with
a
tall
purple
peak
bursting
out
from
the
blue
i
pull
her
together
i
press
her
and
she
shot
down
the
decline
to
the
company
yard
and
on
by
the
paddocks
yet
under
my
knee
i
could
feel
her
heart
thumping
the
hard
yet
a
mile
and
another
and
now
we
were
near
the
goal
and
the
fields
and
the
farms
flitted
past
and
the
two
fences
i
turned
with
a
cheer
for
a
green
mare
was
a
far
thing
and
fast
and
labourers
roused
by
her
galloping
hoofs
saw
rider
and
steed
and
shone
the
white
walls
and
the
roofs
of
the
township
i
steadied
her
then
i
had
need
where
stood
the
old
chapel
where
stands
the
new
church
since
chapels
to
churches
have
changed
in
that
town
a
short
sidelong
stagger
a
long
forward
lurch
a
slight
choking
sob
and
the
mare
had
gone
down
i
slipp
off
the
bridle
i
slacken
the
girth
i
ran
on
and
left
her
and
told
them
my
news
i
saw
her
soon
afterwards
what
was
she
worth
how
much
for
her
hide
she
had
never
worn
shoes
no
name
a
stone
upon
her
heart
and
head
but
no
name
written
on
that
stone
sweet
neighbours
whisper
low
instead
this
sinner
was
a
loving
mrs
browning
is
a
nameless
stone
that
stands
at
your
head
the
gusts
in
the
gloomy
gorges
whirl
brown
leaves
and
red
till
they
cover
your
bed
now
i
trust
that
your
sleep
is
a
sound
one
girl
i
said
in
my
wrath
when
his
shadow
from
your
garden
gate
to
your
cottage
door
what
does
it
matter
for
one
soul
lost
millions
of
souls
have
been
lost
before
yet
i
warn
you
ah
but
my
words
came
true
perhaps
some
day
you
will
find
him
out
he
who
was
not
worthy
to
loosen
your
shoe
does
his
conscience
therefore
prick
him
i
doubt
you
laughed
and
were
deaf
to
my
warning
voice
blush
and
were
blind
to
his
cloven
hoof
you
have
had
your
chance
you
have
taken
your
choice
how
could
i
help
you
standing
aloof
he
has
prosper
well
with
the
world
he
says
i
am
mad
if
so
and
if
he
be
sane
i
at
least
give
god
thanksgiving
and
praise
that
there
lies
between
us
one
difference
plain
you
in
your
beauty
above
me
bent
in
the
pause
of
a
wild
west
country
ball
spoke
to
me
touched
me
without
intent
made
me
your
servant
for
once
and
all
light
laughter
rippled
your
lip
and
you
swept
my
cheek
with
a
shining
curl
that
stray
from
your
shoulder
snowy
tip
now
i
pray
that
your
sleep
is
a
sound
one
girl
from
a
long
way
off
to
look
at
your
charms
made
my
blood
run
redder
in
every
vein
and
he
he
has
held
you
long
in
his
arms
and
has
kiss
you
over
and
over
again
is
it
well
that
he
keeps
well
out
of
my
way
if
we
met
he
and
i
we
alone
we
two
would
i
give
him
one
moment
grace
to
pray
not
i
for
the
sake
of
the
soul
he
slew
a
life
like
a
shuttlecock
may
be
with
the
hand
of
fate
for
a
battledore
but
it
matters
much
for
your
sweet
soul
lost
as
much
as
a
million
souls
and
more
and
i
know
that
if
here
or
there
alone
i
found
him
fairly
and
face
to
face
having
slain
his
body
i
would
slay
my
own
that
my
soul
to
satan
his
soul
might
chase
he
hardens
his
heart
in
the
public
way
who
am
i
i
am
but
a
nameless
churl
but
god
will
put
all
things
straight
some
day
till
then
may
your
sleep
be
a
sound
one
girl
wolf
and
hound
the
hills
like
giants
at
a
hunting
lay
chin
upon
hand
to
see
the
game
at
browning
you
take
my
tale
with
a
little
salt
but
it
needs
none
nevertheless
i
was
foil
completely
fairly
at
fault
dishearten
too
i
confess
at
the
splitters
tent
i
had
seen
the
track
of
fresh
on
the
sward
and
though
darby
lynch
and
donovan
jack
who
could
swear
through
a
board
solemnly
swore
he
had
not
been
there
i
was
just
as
sure
that
they
lied
for
to
darby
all
that
is
foul
was
fair
and
jack
for
his
life
was
tried
we
had
run
him
for
seven
miles
and
more
as
hard
as
our
nags
could
split
at
the
start
they
were
all
too
weary
and
sore
and
his
was
quite
fresh
and
fit
young
marsden
pony
had
had
enough
on
the
plain
where
the
chase
was
hot
we
breasted
the
swell
of
the
bittern
bluff
and
mark
could
raise
a
trot
when
the
sea
like
a
splendid
silver
shield
to
the
suddenly
lay
on
the
brow
of
the
beetle
the
chestnut
reel
and
i
bid
to
and
i
was
alone
when
the
mare
fell
lame
with
a
pointed
flint
in
her
shoe
on
the
stony
flats
i
had
lost
the
game
and
what
was
a
man
to
do
i
turned
away
with
no
fixed
intent
and
headed
for
hawthorndell
i
could
neither
eat
in
the
splitters
tent
nor
drink
at
the
splitters
well
i
knew
that
they
gloried
in
my
mishap
and
i
cursed
them
between
my
teeth
a
sunset
through
brayton
gap
flung
a
lurid
fire
on
the
heath
could
i
reach
the
dell
i
had
little
reck
and
with
scarce
a
choice
of
my
own
i
threw
the
reins
on
miladi
neck
i
had
freed
her
foot
from
the
stone
that
season
most
of
the
swamps
were
dry
and
after
so
hard
a
burst
in
the
sultry
noon
of
so
hot
a
sky
she
was
keen
to
appease
her
thirst
or
by
instinct
urged
or
impelled
by
fate
i
care
not
to
solve
these
things
certain
it
is
that
she
took
me
straight
to
the
warrigal
water
springs
i
can
shut
my
eyes
and
recall
the
ground
as
though
it
were
yesterday
with
a
shelf
of
the
low
grey
rocks
girt
round
the
springs
in
their
basin
lay
woods
to
the
east
and
wolds
to
the
north
in
the
sundown
sullenly
bloom
dead
black
on
a
curtain
of
crimson
cloth
large
peaks
to
the
westward
loomed
i
led
miladi
through
weed
and
sedge
she
leisurely
drank
her
fill
there
was
something
close
to
the
water
edge
and
my
heart
with
one
leap
stood
still
for
a
horse
shoe
and
a
rider
boot
had
left
clean
prints
on
the
clay
someone
had
watered
his
beast
on
foot
was
he
he
had
gone
which
way
then
the
mouth
of
the
cavern
faced
me
fair
as
i
turned
and
fronted
the
rocks
so
at
last
i
had
pressed
the
wolf
to
his
lair
i
had
run
to
his
earth
the
fox
i
thought
so
perhaps
he
was
resting
perhaps
he
was
waiting
watching
for
me
i
examined
all
my
revolver
caps
i
hitched
my
mare
to
a
tree
i
had
sworn
to
have
him
alive
or
dead
and
to
give
him
a
chance
was
loth
he
knew
his
life
had
been
forfeited
he
had
even
heard
of
my
oath
in
my
stocking
soles
to
the
shelf
i
crept
i
crawl
safe
into
the
cave
all
silent
if
he
was
there
he
slept
not
there
all
dark
as
the
grave
through
the
crack
i
could
hear
the
leaden
hiss
see
the
livid
face
through
the
flame
how
strange
it
seems
that
a
man
should
miss
when
his
life
depends
on
his
aim
there
could
have
been
a
better
light
for
him
nor
a
worse
for
me
we
were
coop
up
caged
like
beasts
for
a
fight
and
dumb
as
dumb
beasts
were
we
flash
flash
bang
bang
and
we
blazed
away
and
the
grey
roof
reddened
and
rang
flash
flash
and
i
felt
his
bullet
flay
the
tip
of
my
ear
flash
bang
bang
flash
and
my
pistol
arm
fell
broke
i
struck
with
my
left
hand
then
struck
at
a
corpse
through
a
cloud
of
smoke
i
had
shot
him
dead
in
his
den
de
te
a
burning
glass
of
burnished
brass
the
calm
sea
caught
the
noontide
rays
and
sunny
slopes
of
golden
grass
and
wastes
of
seem
to
blaze
beyond
the
shining
beyond
the
shades
of
denser
bloom
the
girt
with
glowing
haze
the
farthest
faintest
forest
gloom
and
the
everlasting
hills
that
loom
we
heard
the
hound
beneath
the
mound
we
scared
the
swamp
hawk
hovering
nigh
we
had
not
sought
for
that
we
found
he
lay
as
dead
men
only
lie
with
wan
cheek
whitening
in
the
sky
through
the
wild
heath
flowers
white
and
red
the
dumb
brute
that
had
seen
him
die
close
crouching
howl
beside
the
head
brute
burial
service
the
dead
the
brow
was
rife
with
seams
of
strife
a
lawless
death
made
doubly
plain
the
ravage
of
a
reckless
life
the
havoc
of
a
hurricane
of
passions

that
breadth
of
brain
like
headlong
horses

just
stripped

arching
her

to

fiery
strong
quarters
and
wiry
a
loin
rather
light
but
a
shoulder
superb
some
parting
injunction
bestowed
with
great
unction
i
tried
to
recall
but
forgot
like
a
dunce
when
reginald
murray
full
tilt
on
white
surrey
came
down
in
a
hurry
to
start
us
at
once
keep
back
in
the
yellow
come
up
on
othello
hold
hard
on
the
chestnut
turn
round
on
the
drag
keep
back
there
on
spartan
back
you
sir
in
tartan
so
steady
there
easy
and
down
went
the
flag
we
started
and
kerr
made
strong
running
on
mermaid
through
furrows
that
led
to
the
first
the
crack
half
extended
look
bloodlike
and
splendid
held
wide
on
the
right
where
the
headland
was
sound
i
pulled
hard
to
baffle
her
rush
with
the
snaffle
before
her
of
the
field
got
away
all
through
the
wet
pasture
where
floods
of
the
last
year
still
loitered
they
clotted
my
crimson
with
clay
the
fourth
fence
a
wattle
floor
monk
and
bluebottle
the
drag
came
to
grief
at
the
blackthorn
and
ditch
the

toppled
over

and
red
rover
the
lane
stopped
lycurgus
and
leicestershire
witch
she
passed
like
an
arrow
kildare

cock
sparrow
and
mantrap
and
mermaid
refused
the
stone
wall
and
giles
on
the
greyling
came
down
at
the
paling
and
i
was
left
sailing
in
front
of
them
all
i
took
them
a
burster
nor
eased
her
nor
nursed
her
until
the
black
bullfinch
led
into
the
plough
and
through
the
strong
bramble
we
bored
with
a
scramble
my
cap
was
knock
off
by
the
bough
where
furrows
looked
lighter
i
drew
the
rein
tighter
her
dark
chest
all
dappled
with
flakes
of
white
foam
her
flanks
a
weak
rail
she
shattered
we
landed
on
turf
with
our
heads
turn
for
home
then
crash
a
low
binder
and
then
close
behind
her
the
sward
to
the
strokes
of
the
favourite
shook
his
rush
roused
her
mettle
yet
ever
so
little
she
shortened
her
stride
as
we
raced
at
the
brook
she
rose
when
i
hit
her
i
saw
the
stream
glitter
a
wide
scarlet
nostril
flashed
close
to
my
knee
between
sky
and
water
the
clown
came
and
caught
her
the
space
that
he
cleared
was
a
caution
to
see
and
forcing
the
running
discarding
all
cunning
a
length
to
the
front
went
the
rider
in
green
a
long
strip
of
stubble
and
then
the
big
double
two
stiff
flights
of
rails
with
a
quickset
between
she
raced
at
the
rasper
i
felt
my
knees
grasp
her
i
found
my
hands
give
to
her
strain
on
the
bit
she
rose
when
the
clown
did
our
silks
as
we
bounded
brush
lightly
our
stirrups
clash
loud
as
we

and
you

in

of

chill
we
were
dreamers
of
old
together
as
of
old
are
you
dreaming
still
for
nothing
on
earth
is
sadder
than
the
dream
that
cheated
the
grasp
the
flower
that
turned
to
the
adder
the
fruit
that
changed
to
the
asp
when
the
in
darkness
closes
as
the
sunset
fades
from
the
hills
with
the
fragrance
of
perish
roses
with
the
music
of
rills
when
the
sands
on
the
nourish
red
clover
and
yellow
corn
when
figs
on
the
thistle
flourish
and
grapes
grow
thick
on
the
thorn
when
the
dead
branch
blighted
and
blasted
puts
forth
green
leaves
in
the
spring
then
the
dream
that
life
has
outlasted
dead
comfort
to
life
may
bring

have
changed
the
soil
and
the
season
but
whether
skies
freeze

the
soil
they
flame

is
changed
in
little

the

points
to
the
the
river
runs
to

and
you
would
have
me
look
forward

backward
i

would
flee
i
remember
the
bright
spring
garlands
the
gold
that
spangled
the
green
and
the
purple
on
fairy
far
lands
and
the
white
and
the
red
bloom
seen
from
the
spot
where
we
last
lay
dreaming
together
yourself
and
i
the
soft
grass
beneath
us
gleaming
above
us
the
great
grave
sky
and
we
spoke
thus
though
we
have
trodden
rough
paths
in
our
boyish
years
and
some
with
our
sweat
are
sodden
and
some
are
salt
with
our
tears
though
we
stumble
still
walking
blindly
our
paths
shall
be
made
all
straight
we
are
weak
but
the
heavens
are
kindly
the
skies
are
compassionate
is
the
clime
of
the
old
land
younger
where
the
young
dreams
longer
are
nursed
with
the
old
insatiable
hunger
with
the
old
unquenchable
thirst
are
you
longing
as
in
the
old
years
we
have
longed
so
often
in
vain
still
though
the
seas
have
sundered
us
twain
but
the
young
dreams
surely
have
faded
young
dreams
old
dreams
of
young
days
shall
the
new
dream
vex
us
as
they
did

as
things
worth
censure

we
fight
against
odds
as
well
the
skies
will
the
great
skies
care
for
our
footsteps
straighten
our
path
or
strengthen
our

we

rather

against
the

in

fought
did
the

man

though
these
gave

to

gave

is

derision
and

brought

shall
we
wake
from
a
troubled
vision
or
rest
from
a
toilsome
day
nay
i
can
not
tell
peradventure
our
very
toil
is
a
dream
and
the
works
that
we
praise
or
censure
it
may
be
they
only
seem
if
so
i
would
fain
awaken
or
sleep
more
soundly
than
so
or
by
dreamless
sleep
overtaken
the
dream
i
would
fain
forego
for
the
great
things
of
earth
are
small
things
the
longest
life
is
a
span
and
there
is
an
end
to
all
things
a
season
to
every
man
whose
glory
is
dust
and
ashes
whose
spirit
is
but
a
spark
that
out
from
the
darkness
flashes
and
flickers
out
in
the
dark
we
remember
the
pangs
that
wrung
us
when
some
went
down
to
the
pit
who
faded
as
leaves
among
us
who
flitted
as
shadows
flit
what
visions
under
the
stone
lie
what
dreams
in
the
shroud
sleep
dwell
for
we
saw
the
earth
pit
only
and
we
heard
only
the
knell
we
know
not
whether
they
slumber
who
waken
on
earth
no
more
as
the
stars
of
the
heights
in
number
as
sands
on
the
deep
shall
stiffness
bind
them
and
starkness
enthral
them
by
field
and
flood
till
the
sun
shall
be
turn
to
darkness
and
the
moon
shall
be
turn
to
blood
we
know
not
worse
may
enthral
men
the
wages
of
sin
are
death
and
so
death
passed
upon
all
men
for
sin
was
born
with
man
breath
then
the
labourer
spent
with
sinning
his
hire
with
his
life
shall
spend
for
it
was
so
in
the
beginning
and
shall
be
so
in
the
end
there
is
life
in
the
blacken
ember
while
a
spark
is
smouldering
yet
in
a
dream
now
i
remember
that
dream
i
had
lief
forget
i
had
lief
forget
i
had
lief
that
dream
with
this
doubt
should
die
if
we
did
these
things
in
the
green
leaf
what
shall
be
done
in
the
dry
the
rhyme
of
joyous
garde
through
the
lattice
rushes
the
south
wind
dense
with
fumes
of
the
flowery
frankincense
from
hawthorn
blossoming
thickly
and
gold
is
shower
on
grass
unshorn
and
on
shuddering
corn
with
flooded
and
flush
with
morn
and
scented
with
sweetness
sickly
the
bloom
and
brilliance
of
summer
days
the
buds
that
brighten
the
fields
that
blaze
the
fruits
that
ripen
and
redden
and
all
the
gifts
of
a
light
are
sadder
things
in
my
shameful
sight
than
the
blackest
gloom
of
the
bitterest
night
when
the
senses
darken
and
deaden
for
the
days
recall
what
the
nights
efface
scenes
of
glory
and
seasons
of
grace
for
which
there
is
no
returning
else
the
days
were
even
as
the
nights
to
me
now
the
axe
is
laid
to
the
root
of
the
tree
and
the
barren
trunk
may
be
cut
down
cast
forth
for
the
burning
would
god
i
had
died
the
death
that
day
when
the
bishop
blessed
us
before
the
fray
at
the
shrine
of
the
saviour
mother
we
buckled
the
spur
we
braced
the
belt
arthur
and
i
together
we
knelt
and
the
grasp
of
his
kingly
hand
i
felt
as
the
grasp
of
an
only
brother
the
body
and
the
blood
of
christ
we
shared
knees
bended
and
heads
bow
down
and
bared
we
listened
throughout
the
praying
eftsoon
the
shock
of
the
foe
we
bore
shoulder
to
shoulder
on
severn
shore
till
our
hilts
were
glued
to
our
hands
with
gore
and
our
sinews
slacken
with
slaying
was
i
far
from
thy
kingdom
gracious
lord
with
a
shattered
casque
and
a
shiver
sword
on
the
threshold
of
mary
chapel
pardie
i
had
won
that
crown
which
endureth
more
than
a
knight
renown
when
the
pagan
giant
had
got
me
down
sore
spent
in
the
deadly
grapple
may
his
craven
spirit
find
little
grace
he
was
seal
to
satan
in
any
case
yet
the
loser
had
been
the
winner
had
i
waxed
fainter
or
he
less
faint
then
my
soul
was
free
from
this
loathsome
taint
i
had
died
as
a
christian
knight
no
saint
perchance
yet
a
pardon
sinner
but
i
strove
full
grimly
beneath
his
weight
i
clung
to
his
poignard
desperate
i
baffled
the
thrust
that
followed
and
writhing
uppermost
rose
to
deal
with
bare
three
inches
of
broken
steel
one
stroke
ha
the
headpiece
crash
piecemeal
and
the
knave
in
his
black
blood
wallow
so
i
lived
for
worse
in
fulness
of
time
when
peace
for
a
season
sway
the
clime
and
spears
for
a
space
were
idle
trusted
and
chosen
of
all
the
court
a
favoured
herald
of
fair
report
i
travell
eastward
and
duly
brought
a
bride
to
a
queenly
bridal
pardie
was
a
morning
even
as
this
the
skies
were
warmer
if
aught
i
wis
albeit
the
fields
were
duller
or
it
may
be
that
the
envious
spring
abash
at
the
sight
of
a
fairer
thing
wax
somewhat
sadder
of
colouring
because
of
her
faultless
colour
with
her
through
the
lyonesse
i
rode
till
the
woods
with
the
noontide
fervour
glow
and
there
for
a
space
we
halted
where
the
intertwining
branches
made
cool
carpets
of
shade
and
the
floors
with
fretwork
of
flame
inlaid
from
leafy
lattices
vaulted
and
scarf
and
mantle
for
her
i
spread
and
strewed
them
over
the
grassiest
bed
and
under
the
greenest
awning
and
loosen
latch
and
buckle
and
freed
from
selle
and
housing
the
red
roan
steed
and
the
jennet
of
swift
iberian
breed
that
had
carried
us
since
the
dawning
the
brown
thrush
sang
through
the
briar
and
bower
all
flush
or
frosted
with
forest
flower
in
the
warm
sun
wanton
glances
and
i
grew
deaf
to
the
song
bird
blind
to
blossom
that
sweeten
the
sweet
spring
wind
i
saw
her
only
a
girl
reclined
in
her
girlhood
indolent
trances
and
the
song
and
the
scent
and
sense
wax
weak
the
wild
rose
withered
beside
the
cheek
she
poised
on
her
fingers
slender
the
soft
spun
gold
of
her
glittering
hair
ran
rippling
into
a
wondrous
snare
that
flooded
the
round
arm
bright
and
bare
and
the
shoulder
silvery
splendour
the
deep
dusk
fires
in
those
dreamy
eyes
like
seas
in
summer
skies
were
guiltless
of
future
treason
and
i
stood
watching
her
still
and
mute
yet
the
evil
seed
in
my
soul
found
root
and
the
sad
plant
throve
and
the
sinful
fruit
grew
ripe
in
the
shameful
season
let
the
sin
be
mine
as
the
shame
was
hers
in
desolate
days
of
departed
years
she
had
leisure
for
shame
and
sorrow
there
was
light
repentance
and
brief
remorse
when
i
rode
against
saxon
foes
or
norse
with
clang
of
harness
and
clatter
of
horse
and
little
heed
for
the
morrow
and
now
she
is
dead
men
tell
me
and
i
in
this
living
death
must
i
linger
and
lie
till
my
cup
to
the
dregs
is
drunken
i
looked
through
the
lattice
worn
and
grim
with
eyelids
darken
and
eyesight
dim
and
weary
body
and
wasted
limb
and
sinew
slacken
and
shrunken
she
is
dead
gone
down
to
the
where
the
cleave
to
her
faultless
face
where
the
crumble
around
her
and
that
bright
burden
of
burnish
gold
that
once
on
those
waxen
shoulders
roll
will
it
spoil
with
the
damps
of
the
deadly
mould
was
it
shorn
when
the
church
vows
bound
her
now
i
know
full
well
that
the
fair
spear
shaft
shall
never
gladden
my
hand
nor
the
haft
of
the
good
sword
grow
to
my
fingers
now
the
maddest
fray
the
merriest
din
would
fail
to
quicken
this
thin
yet
the
sleepy
poison
of
that
sweet
sin
in
the
sluggish
current
still
lingers
would
god
i
had
slept
with
the
slain
men
long
or
ever
the
heart
conceived
a
wrong
that
the
innermost
soul
abhorred
or
ever
these
lying
lips
were
strained
to
her
lids
and
or
ever
those
traitorous
kisses
stained
the
snows
of
her
spotless
forehead
let
me
gather
a
little
strength
to
think
as
one
who
reels
on
the
outermost
brink
to
the
innermost
gulf
descending
in
that
truce
the
longest
and
last
of
all
in
the
summer
nights
of
that
festival
soft
vesture
of
samite
and
silken
pall
the
beginning
came
of
the
ending
and
one
trod
softly
with
sandal
feet
ah
why
are
the
stolen
waters
sweet
and
one
crept
stealthily
after
i
would
i
had
taken
him
there
and
wrung
his
knavish
neck
when
the
dark
door
swung
or
torn
by
the
roots
his
treacherous
tongue
and
stifled
his
hateful
laughter
so
the
smouldering
scandal
blazed
but
he
my
king
to
the
last
put
trust
in
me
aye
well
was
his
trust
requited
now
priests
may
patter
and
bells
may
toll
he
will
need
no
masses
to
aid
his
soul
when
the
angels
open
the
judgment
scroll
his
wrong
will
be
tenfold
righted
then
dawn
the
day
when
the
mail
was
donn
and
the
steed
for
the
strife
caparison
but
not
the
norse
invader
then
was
bloodshed
not
by
untoward
chance
as
the
blood
that
is
drawn
by
the
jouster
lance
the
fray
in
the
castle
of
melegrance
the
fight
in
the
lists
with
mador
then
the
guilt
made
manifest
then
the
siege
when
the
true
men
rallying
round
the
liege
beleaguer
his
base
betrayer
then
the
fruitless
parleys
the
pleadings
vain
and
the
battles
with
brave
gawaine
twice
worsted
and
once
so
nearly
slain
i
may
well
be
counted
his
slayer
then
the
crime
of
modred
a
little
sin
at
the
side
of
mine
though
the
knave
was
kin
to
the
king
by
the
knave
hand
stricken
and
the
knight
was
he
there
to
save
that
knightly
king
who
that
knighthood
gave
ah
christ
will
he
greet
me
as
knight
or
knave
in
the
day
when
the
dust
shall
quicken
had
he
lightly
loved
had
he
trusted
less
i
had
sinn
perchance
with
the
sinfulness
that
through
prayer
and
penance
is
pardoned
oh
love
most
loyal
oh
faith
most
sure
in
the
purity
of
a
soul
so
pure
i
found
my
safeguard
i
sinn
secure
till
my
heart
to
the
sin
grew
harden
we
were
glad
together
in
gladsome
meads
when
they
shook
to
the
strokes
of
our
snorting
steeds
we
were
joyful
in
joyous
lustre
when
it
flush
the
coppice
or
fill
the
glade
where
the
horn
of
the
dane
or
the
saxon
bray
and
we
saw
the
heathen
banner
display
and
the
heathen
lances
cluster
then
a
rush
and
a
ring
and
a
crash
of
the
spear
staves
splintering
and
the
billowy
battle
blended
riot
of
chargers
revel
of
blows
and
fierce
flush
faces
of
fighting
foes
from
croup
to
bridle
that
reel
and
rose
in
a
sparkle
of
splendid
and
the
long
lithe
sword
in
the
hand
became
as
a
leaping
light
as
a
falling
flame
as
a
fire
through
the
flax
that
hasted
slender
and
shining
and
beautiful
how
it
shore
through
shivering
casque
and
skull
and
never
a
stroke
was
void
and
null
and
never
a
thrust
was
wasted
i
have
done
for
ever
with
all
these
things
deeds
that
were
joyous
to
knights
and
kings
in
days
that
with
songs
were
cherish
the
songs
are
ended
the
deeds
are
done
there
shall
none
of
them
gladden
me
now
not
one
there
is
nothing
good
for
me
under
the
sun
but
to
perish
as
these
things
perish
shall
it
profit
me
aught
that
the
bishop
seeks
my
presence
daily
and
duly
speaks
soft
words
of
comfort
and
kindness
shall
it
aught
avail
me
certes
he
said
though
thy
soul
is
darken
be
not
afraid
god
hateth
nothing
that
he
hath
made
his
light
shall
disperse
thy
blindness
i
am
not
afraid
for
myself
although
i
know
i
have
had
that
light
and
i
know
the
greater
my
condemnation
when
i
swoon
in
the
bliss
of
that
first
long
sweet
slow
stolen
kiss
i
would
gladly
have
given
for
less
than
this
myself
with
my
soul
salvation
i
would
languish
thus
in
some
loathsome
den
as
a
thing
of
naught
in
the
eyes
of
men
in
the
mouths
of
men
as
a
through
years
of
pain
and
when
god
saw
fit
singing
his
praises
my
soul
should
flit
to
the
darkest
depth
of
the
nethermost
pit
if
hers
could
be
wafted
skyward
lord
christ
have
patience
a
little
while
i
have
sinn
because
i
am
utterly
vile
having
light
loving
darkness
rather
and
i
pray
thee
deal
with
me
as
thou
wilt
yet
the
blood
of
thy
foes
i
have
freely
spilt
and
moreover
mine
is
the
greater
guilt
in
the
sight
of
thee
and
thy
father
that
saint
thy
servant
was
counted
dear
whose
sword
in
the
garden
grazed
the
ear
of
thine
enemy
lord
redeemer
not
thus
on
the
shattering
visor
in
this
hand
the
iron
of
the
hilt
when
the
blade
was
swallow
up
to
the
guard
through
the
teeth
of
the
strong
blasphemer
if
ever
i
smote
as
a
man
should
smite
if
i
struck
one
stroke
that
seem
good
in
thy
sight
by
thy
loving
mercy
prevailing
lord
let
her
stand
in
the
light
of
thy
face
cloth
with
thy
love
and
crown
with
thy
grace
when
i
gnash
my
teeth
in
the
terrible
place
that
is
fill
with
weeping
and
wailing
shall
i
comfort
my
soul
on
account
of
this
in
the
world
to
come
whatsoever
it
is
there
is
no
more
earthly
for
the
dusty
darkness
shall
slay
desire
and
the
chaff
may
burn
with
unquenchable
fire
but
for
green
wild
growth
of
thistle
and
briar
at
least
there
is
no
renewing
and
this
grievous
burden
of
life
shall
change
in
the
dim
hereafter
dreamy
and
strange
and
sorrows
and
joys
diurnal
and
partial
blessings
and
perishing
ills
shall
fade
in
the
praise
or
the
pang
that
fills
the
glory
of
god
eternal
hills
or
the
gloom
of
his
gulf
eternal
yet
if
all
things
change
to
the
glory
of
one
who
for
all
gave
his
own
sweet
son
to
his
goodness
so
shall
he
change
ill
when
the
world
as
a
wither
leaf
shall
be
and
the
sky
like
a
shrivell
scroll
shall
flee
and
souls
shall
be
summon
from
land
and
sea
at
the
blast
of
his
bright
archangel

we
severed
in
autumn
early
ere
the
earth
was
torn
by
the
plough
the
wheat
and

the
barley
are
ripe
for

by
the
rain
through
the
flowers
those
hills
adorning
thou
comest
not
back
again
my
heart
is
heavy
and
weary
with
the
weight
of
a
weary
soul
the
glare
grows
dreary
and
dreary
the
midnight
scroll
the
sigh
for
the
sickle
the
load
of
the
golden
grain
i
sigh
for
a
mate
more
fickle
thou
comest
not
back
again
the
warm
sun
riseth
and
setteth
the
night
bringeth
dew
but
the
soul
that
longeth
forgetteth
the
warmth
and
the
moisture
too
in
the
hot
sun
rising
and
setting
there
is
naught
save
feverish
pain
there
are
tears
in
the
wetting
thou
comest
not
back
again
thy
voice
in
mine
ear
still
mingles
with
the
voices
of
trees
thy
kiss
on
my
cheek
still
tingles
at
each
kiss
of
the
summer
breeze
while
dreams
of
the
past
are
thronging
for
substance
of
shades
in
vain
i
am
waiting
watching
and
longing
thou
comest
not
back
again
waiting
and
watching
ever
longing
and
lingering
yet
leaves
rustle
and
quiver
winds
murmur
and
waters
fret
no
answer
they
bring
no
greeting
no
speech
save
that
sad
refrain
nor
voice
save
an
echo
repeating
he
cometh
not
back
again
the
three
friends
from
the
french
the
sword
slew
one
in
deadly
strife
one
perish
by
the
bowl
the
third
lies
by
the
knife
for
three
the
bells
may
toll
i
loved
her
better
than
my
life
and
better
than
my
soul
aye
father
hast
thou
come
at
last
is
somewhat
late
to
pray
life
crimson
tides
are
ebbing
fast
they
drain
my
soul
away
mine
eyes
with
film
are
overcast
the
lights
are
waning
grey
this
curl
from
her
bright
head
i
shore
and
this
her
hands
gave
mine
see
one
is
stained
with
purple
gore
and
one
with
poison
wine
give
these
to
her
when
all
is
how
they
twine
we
three
were
brethren
in
arms
and
sworn
companions
we
we
held
this
motto
whoso
harms
the
one
shall
harm
the
three
till
matchless
for
her
subtle
charms
beloved
of
each
was
she
these
two
were
slain
that
i
might
kiss
her
sweet
mouth
i
did
well
i
said
there
is
no
greater
bliss
for
those
in
heaven
that
dwell
i
lost
her
then
i
said
there
is
no
fiercer
pang
in
hell
we
have
upheld
each
other
rights
shared
purse
and
borrow
blade
have
stricken
side
by
side
in
fights
and
side
by
side
have
prayed
in
churches
we
were
christian
knights
and
she
a
christian
maid
we
met
at
sunrise
he
and
i
my
comrade
was
agreed
the
steel
our
quarrel
first
should
try
the
poison
should
succeed
for
two
of
three
were
doom
to
die
and
one
was
doom
to
bleed
we
buckled
to
the
doubtful
fray
at
first
with
some
remorse
but
he
who
must
be
slain
or
slay
soon
strikes
with
vengeful
force
he
fell
i
left
him
where
he
lay
among
the
trampled
gorse
did
passion
warp
my
heart
and
head
to
madness
and
if
so
can
madness
palliate
bloodshed
it
may
be
i
shall
know
when
god
shall
gather
up
the
dead
from
where
the
four
winds
blow
we
met
at
sunset
he
and
i
my
second
comrade
true
two
cups
with
wine
were
brimming
high
and
one
was
drugg
we
knew
not
which
nor
sought
we
to
descry
our
choice
by
lot
we
drew
and
there
i
sat
with
him
to
sup
i
heard
him
blithely
speak
of
days
the
fatal
cup
forgotten
seem
his
cheek
was
ruddy
father
raise
me
up
my
voice
is
waxing
weak
we
drank
his
lips
turned
livid
white
his
cheeks
grew
leaden
ash
he
reel
i
heard
his
temples
smite
the
threshold
with
a
crash
and
from
his
hand
in
shivers
bright
i
saw
the
goblet
flash
the
morrow
dawn
with
fragrance
rare
the
may
breeze
from
the
west
just
fann
the
sleepy
olives
where
she
heard
and
i
confess
my
hair
entangled
with
her
hair
her
breast
strained
to
my
breast
on
the
dread
verge
of
endless
gloom
my
soul
recalls
that
hour
skies
languishing
with
balm
of
bloom
and
fields
aflame
with
flower
and
slow
caresses
that
consume
and
kisses
that
devour
ah
now
with
storm
the
day
seems
rife
my
dull
ears
catch
the
roll
of
thunder
and
the
far
sea
strife
on
beach
and
bar
and
shoal
i
loved
her
better
than
my
life
and
better
than
my
soul
she
fled
i
can
not
prove
her
guilt
nor
would
i
an
i
could
see
life
for
life
is
fairly
spilt
and
blood
is
shed
for
blood
her
white
hands
neither
touched
the
hilt
nor
yet
the
potion
brew
aye
turn
me
from
the
sickly
south
towards
the
gusty
north
the
fruits
of
sin
are
dust
and
drouth
the
end
of
crime
is
wrath
the
lips
that
pressed
her
mouth
are
choked
with
froth
then
dig
the
deep
and
wide
three
graves
thrown
into
one
and
lay
three
corpses
side
by
side
and
tell
their
tale
to
none
but
bring
her
back
in
all
her
pride
to
see
what
she
hath
done
a
song
of
autumn
where
shall
we
go
for
our
garlands
glad
at
the
falling
of
the
year
when
the
banks
are
yellow
and
sad
when
the
boughs
are
yellow
and
sere
where
are
the
old
ones
that
once
we
had
and
when
are
the
new
ones
near
what
shall
we
do
for
our
garlands
glad
at
the
falling
of
the
year
child
can
i
tell
where
the
garlands
go
can
i
say
where
the
lost
leaves
veer
on
the
banks
when
the
wild
winds
blow
when
they
drift
through
the
drear
girl
when
the
garlands
of
next
year
glow
you
may
gather
again
my
dear
but
i
go
where
the
last
year
lost
leaves
go
at
the
falling
of
the
year
the
romance
of
britomarte
as
related
by
sergeant
leigh
on
the
night
he
got
his
captaincy
at
the
restoration
i
tell
you
a
story
but
pass
the
jack
and
let
us
make
merry
my
men
aye
those
were
the
days
when
my
beard
was
black
i
like
to
remember
them
now
and
then
then
miles
was
living
and
cuthbert
there
on
his
lip
was
never
a
sign
of
down
but
i
carry
about
some
braided
hair
that
has
not
yet
changed
from
the
glossy
brown
that
it
showed
the
day
when
i
broke
the
heart
of
that
bravest
of
destriers
britomarte
sir
hugh
was
slain
may
his
soul
find
grace
in
the
fray
that
was
neither
lost
nor
won
at
edgehill
then
to
hubert
chase
lord
goring
despatched
a
garrison
but
men
and
horses
were
ill
to
spare
and
ere
long
the
soldiers
were
shifted
fast
as
for
me
i
never
was
quartered
there
till
marston
moor
had
been
lost
at
last
as
luck
would
have
it
alone
and
late
in
the
night
i
rode
to
the
northern
gate
i
thought
as
i
passed
through
the
moonlit
park
on
the
boyish
days
i
used
to
spend
in
the
halls
of
the
knight
lying
stiff
and
stark
thought
on
his
lady
my
father
friend
mine
too
in
spite
of
my
sinister
bar
but
with
that
my
story
has
naught
to
do
she
died
the
winter
before
the
war
died
giving
birth
to
the
baby
hugh
he
pass
ere
the
green
leaves
clothed
the
bough
and
the
orphan
girl
was
the
heiress
now
when
i
was
a
rude
and
a
reckless
boy
and
she
a
brave
and
a
beautiful
child
i
was
her
page
her
playmate
her
toy
i
have
crown
her
hair
with
the
wild
cowslip
and
and
bright
i
have
carried
her
miles
when
the
woods
were
wet
i
have
read
her
romances
of
dame
and
knight
she
was
my
princess
my
pride
my
pet
there
was
then
this
proverb
us
twain
between
for
the
glory
of
god
and
of
gwendoline
she
had
grown
to
a
maiden
wonderful
fair
but
for
years
i
had
scarcely
seen
her
face
now
with
troopers
holdsworth
huntly
and
clare
old
miles
kept
guard
at
hubert
chase
and
the
chatelaine
was
a
mistress
ruth
sir
hugh
an
ancient
dame
but
a
mettlesome
soul
had
she
forsooth
as
she
show
when
the
time
of
her
trial
came
i
bore
despatches
to
miles
and
to
her
to
warn
them
against
the
bands
of
kerr
and
mine
would
have
been
a
perilous
ride
with
the
rebel
horsemen
we
knew
not
where
they
were
scattered
over
that
country
side
if
it
had
not
been
for
my
brave
brown
mare
she
was
and
ribb
like
a
drum
and
limb
like
a
deer
fierce
as
the
fire
and
fleet
as
the
wind
there
was
nothing
she
could
climb
or
clear
rich
lords
had
vex
me
in
vain
to
part
for
their
gold
and
silver
with
britomarte
next
morn
we
muster
scarce
half
a
score
with
the
serving
men
who
were
poorly
arm
five
soldiers
counting
myself
no
more
and
a
culverin
which
might
well
have
us
had
we
used
it
but
not
our
foes
when
with
horses
and
foot
to
our
doors
they
came
and
a
summon
us
through
his
nose
and
deliver
this
in
the
people
name
unto
whoso
holdeth
this
fortress
here
surrender
or
bide
the
siege
john
kerr
was
a
mansion
built
in
a
style
too
new
a
castle
by
courtesy
he
lied
who
called
it
a
fortress
yet
is
true
it
had
been
indifferently
fortified
we
were
well
provided
with
bolt
and
bar
and
while
i
hurried
to
place
our
men
old
miles
was
call
to
a
council
of
war
with
mistress
ruth
and
with
her
and
when
they
had
argued
loudly
and
long
those
three
they
sent
as
a
last
resource
for
me
in
the
chair
of
state
sat
erect
dame
ruth
she
had
cast
aside
her
embroidery
she
had
been
a
beauty
they
say
in
her
youth
there
was
much
fierce
fire
in
her
bold
black
eye
am
i
deceived
in
you
both
quoth
she
if
one
spark
of
her
father
spirit
lives
in
this
girl
here
so
this
leigh
ralph
leigh
let
us
hear
what
counsel
the
springald
gives
then
i
stammer
somewhat
taken
aback
simon
you
pass
the
jack
the
dame
wax
hotter
speak
out
lad
say
must
we
fall
in
that
canting
caitiff
power
shall
we
yield
to
a
knave
and
a
turncoat
nay
i
had
liever
leap
from
our
topmost
tower
for
a
while
we
can
surely
await
relief
our
walls
are
high
and
our
doors
are
strong
this
kerr
was
indeed
a
canting
thief
i
know
not
rightly
some
private
wrong
he
had
done
sir
hugh
but
i
know
this
much
traitor
or
turncoat
he
suffer
as
such
quoth
miles
enough
your
will
shall
be
done
relief
may
arrive
by
the
merest
chance
but
your
house
ere
dusk
will
be
lost
and
won
they
have
got
three
pieces
of
ordnance
then
i
cried
lord
guy
with
four
troops
of
horse
even
now
is
biding
at
westbrooke
town
if
a
rider
could
break
through
the
rebel
force
he
would
bring
relief
ere
the
sun
goes
down
through
the
postern
door
could
i
make
one
dart
i
could
baffle
them
all
upon
britomarte
miles
mutter
madness
dame
ruth
look
grave
said
true
though
we
can
not
keep
one
hour
the
courtyard
no
nor
the
stables
save
they
will
have
to
batter
piecemeal
the
tower
and
thus
but
suddenly
she
halted
there
with
a
shining
hand
on
my
shoulder
laid
stood
gwendoline
she
had
left
her
chair
and
nay
if
it
needs
must
be
done
she
said
ralph
leigh
will
gladly
do
it
i
ween
for
the
glory
of
god
and
of
gwendoline
i
had
undertaken
a
heavier
task
for
a
lighter
word
i
saddled
with
care
nor
cumber
myself
with
corselet
nor
casque
being
loth
to
burden
the
brave
brown
mare
young
clare
kept
watch
on
the
wall
he
cried
now
haste
ralph
this
is
the
time
to
seize
the
rebels
are
round
us
on
every
side
but
here
they
straggle
by
twos
and
threes
then
out
i
led
her
and
up
i
sprung
and
the
postern
door
on
its
hinges
swung
i
had
drawn
this
sword
you
may
draw
it
and
feel
for
this
is
the
blade
that
i
bore
that
day
there
a
notch
even
now
on
the
long
grey
steel
a
nick
that
has
never
been
rasp
away
i
bow
my
head
and
i
buried
my
spurs
one
bound
brought
the
gliding
green
beneath
i
could
tell
by
her
flatten
ears
she
had
fairly
taken
the
bit
in
her
teeth
what
jack
have
you
drain
your
namesake
dry
left
nothing
to
quench
the
thirst
of
a
fly
these
things
are
done
and
are
done
with
lad
in
far
less
time
than
your
talker
tells
the
sward
with
their
shook
like
mad
and
rang
with
their
carbines
and
petronels
and
they
shouted
cross
him
and
cut
him
off
surround
him
seize
him
capture
the
clown
or
kill
him
shall
he
escape
to
scoff
in
your
faces
shoot
him
or
cut
him
down
and
their
bullets
whistled
on
every
side
many
were
near
us
and
more
were
wide
not
a
bullet
told
upon
britomarte
suddenly
snorting
she
launched
along
so
the
osprey
dives
where
the
seagulls
dart
so
the
falcon
swoops
where
the
kestrels
throng
and
full
in
my
front
one
pistol
flash
and
right
in
my
path
their
sergeant
got
how
are
jarr
how
are
stirrups
clash
while
the
mare
like
a
meteor
past
him
shot
but
i
clove
his
skull
with
a
backstroke
clean
for
the
glory
of
god
and
of
gwendoline
and
as
one
whom
the
fierce
wind
storms
in
the
face
with
spikes
of
hail
and
with
splinters
of
rain
i
while
we
fled
through
hubert
chase
bent
till
my
cheek
was
amongst
her
mane
to
the
north
full
a
league
of
the
lay
smooth
springy
turf
and
she
fairly
flew
and
the
sound
of
their
died
away
and
their
far
shots
faint
in
the
distance
grew
loudly
i
laughed
having
won
the
start
at
the
folly
of
following
britomarte
they
had
posted
a
guard
at
the
northern
gate
some
dozen
of
pikemen
and
musketeers
to
the
tall
park
palings
i
turn
her
straight
she
veer
in
her
flight
as
the
swallow
veers
and
some
blew
matches
and
some
drew
swords
and
one
of
them
wildly
hurl
his
pike
but
she
clear
by
inches
the
oaken
boards
and
she
carried
me
yards
beyond
the
dyke
then
gaily
over
the
long
green
down
we
gallop
heading
for
westbrooke
town
the
green
down
slopes
to
the
great
grey
moor
the
grey
moor
sinks
to
the
gleaming
skelt
sudden
and
sullen
and
swift
and
sure
the
whirling
water
was
round
my
belt
she
breasted
the
bank
with
a
savage
snort
and
a
backward
glance
of
her
bloodshot
eye
and
our
lady
of
andover
flash
like
thought
and
flitted
agatha
nunnery
and
the
firs
at
the
ferngrove
fled
on
the
right
and
falconer
tower
on
the
left
took
flight
and
over
the
ravenswold
we
raced
we
rounded
the
hill
by
the
hermit
well
we
burst
on
the
westbrooke
bridge
what
haste
what
errand
shouted
the
sentinel
to
beelzebub
with
the
brewer
knave
carolus
rex
and
he
of
the
rhine
galloping
past
him
i
got
and
gave
in
the
gallop
password
and
countersign
all
soak
with
water
and
soil
with
mud
with
the
sleeve
of
my
jerkin
half
drench
in
blood
now
heaven
be
praised
that
i
found
him
there
lord
guy
he
said
having
heard
my
tale
leigh
let
my
own
man
look
to
your
mare
rest
and
recruit
with
our
wine
and
ale
but
first
must
our
surgeon
attend
to
you
you
are
somewhat
shrewdly
stricken
no
doubt
then
he
snatched
a
horn
from
the
wall
and
blew
making
boot
and
saddle
ring
sharply
out
have
i
done
good
service
this
day
quoth
i
then
i
will
ride
back
in
your
troop
lord
guy
in
the
street
i
heard
how
the
trumpets
peal
and
i
caught
the
gleam
of
a
morion
from
the
window
then
to
the
door
i
reel
i
had
lost
more
blood
than
i
reckon
upon
he
eyed
me
calmly
with
keen
grey
eyes
stern
grey
eyes
of
a
grey
said
the
wilful
man
can
never
be
wise
nathless
the
wilful
must
have
his
way
and
he
pour
from
a
flagon
some
fiery
wine
i
drain
it
and
straightway
strength
was
mine
i
was
with
them
all
the
way
on
the
brown
guy
to
the
rescue
god
and
the
king
we
were
just
in
time
for
the
doors
were
down
and
did
our
rasp
and
ring
and
did
we
hew
and
did
we
hack
the
sport
scarce
lasted
minutes
ten
aye
those
were
the
days
when
my
beard
was
black
i
like
to
remember
them
now
and
then
though
they
fought
like
fiends
we
were
four
to
one
and
we
captured
those
that
refused
to
run
we
have
not
forgotten
it
cuthbert
boy
that
supper
scene
when
the
lamps
were
lit
how
the
women
some
of
them
sobb
for
joy
how
the
soldiers
drank
the
deeper
for
it
how
the
dame
did
honours
and
gwendoline
how
grandly
she
glided
into
the
hall
how
she
stoop
with
the
grace
of
a
girlish
queen
and
kiss
me
gravely
before
them
all
and
the
stern
lord
guy
how
gaily
he
laugh
till
more
of
his
cup
was
spilt
than
quaff
brown
britomarte
lay
dead
in
her
straw
next
morn
we
buried
her
brave
old
girl
john
kerr
we
tried
him
by
martial
law
and
we
twisted
some
hemp
for
the
churl
and
she
i
met
her
alone
said
she
you
have
risk
your
life
you
have
lost
your
mare
and
what
can
i
give
in
return
ralph
leigh
i
replied
one
braid
of
that
bright
brown
hair
and
with
that
she
bow
her
beautiful
head
you
can
take
as
much
as
you
choose
she
said
and
i
took
it
it
may
be
more
than
enough
and
i
shore
it
rudely
close
to
the
roots
the
wine
or
wounds
may
have
made
me
rough
and
men
at
the
bottom
are
merely
brutes
three
weeks
i
slept
at
hubert
chase
when
i
woke
from
the
fever
of
wounds
and
wine
i
could
scarce
believe
that
the
ghastly
face
that
the
glass
reflected
was
really
mine
i
sought
the
hall
where
a
wedding
had
been
the
wedding
of
guy
and
of
gwendoline
the
romance
of
a
grizzled
old
trooper
life
may
make
you
laugh
in
your
sleeves
laugh
out
lads
we
have
most
of
us
seen
some
strife
we
have
all
of
us
had
some
sport
no
doubt
i
have
won
some
honour
and
gain
some
gold
now
that
our
king
returns
to
his
own
if
the
pulses
beat
slow
if
the
blood
runs
cold
and
if
friends
have
faded
and
loves
have
flown
then
the
greater
reason
is
ours
to
drink
and
the
more
we
swallow
the
less
we
shall
think
at
the
battle
of
naseby
miles
was
slain
and
huntly
sank
from
his
wounds
that
week
we
left
young
clare
upon
worcester
plain
how
the
ironside
gash
his
girlish
cheek
aye
strut
and
swagger
and
ruffle
anew
gay
gallants
now
that
the
war
is
done
they
fought
like
fiends
give
the
fiend
his
due
we
fought
like
fops
it
was
thus
they
won
holdsworth
is
living
for
aught
i
know
at
least
he
was
living
two
years
ago
and
guy
lord
guy
so
stately
and
stern
he
is
changed
i
met
him
at
winchester
he
has
grown
quite
gloomy
and
taciturn
gwendoline
why
do
you
ask
for
her
died
as
her
mother
had
died
before
died
giving
birth
to
the
baby
guy
did
my
voice
shake
then
am
i
fool
the
more
sooner
or
later
we
all
must
die
but
at
least
let
us
live
while
we
live
the
days
may
be
dark
but
the
lamps
are
bright
for
to
me
the
sunlight
seems
worn
and
wan
the
sun
he
is
losing
his
splendour
now
he
can
never
shine
as
of
old
he
shone
on
her
glorious
hair
and
glittering
brow
ah
those
days
that
were
when
my
beard
was
black
now
i
have
only
the
nights
that
are
what
landlord
ho
bring
in
haste
burnt
sack
and
a
flask
of
your
fiercest
usquebaugh
you
cuthbert
surely
you
know
by
heart
the
story
of
her
and
of
britomarte
laudamus
the
lord
shall
slay
or
the
lord
shall
save
he
is
righteous
whether
he
save
or
slay
brother
give
thanks
for
the
gifts
he
gave
though
the
gifts
he
gave
he
hath
taken
away
shall
we
strive
for
that
which
is
nothing
nay
shall
we
hate
each
other
for
that
which
fled
she
is
but
a
marvel
of
modelled
clay
and
the
smooth
clear
white
and
the
soft
pure
red
that
we
coveted
shall
endure
no
day
was
it
wise
or
well
that
i
hated
you
for
the
fruit
that
hung
too
high
on
the
tree
for
the
blossom
out
of
our
reach
that
grew
was
it
well
or
wise
that
you
hated
me
my
hate
has
flown
and
your
hate
shall
flee
let
us
veil
our
faces
like
children
chid
can
that
violet
orb
we
swore
by
see
through
that
transparent
lid
now
the
lord
forbid
that
this
strife
should
be
would
you
knit
the
forehead
or
clench
the
fist
for
the
curls
that
never
were
well
caress
for
the
red
that
never
was
fairly
kiss
for
the
white
that
never
was
fondly
press
shall
we
nourish
wrath
while
she
lies
at
rest
between
us
surely
our
wrath
shall
cease
we
would
fain
know
better
the
lord
knows
best
is
there
peace
between
us
yea
there
is
peace
in
the
soul
release
she
at
least
is
blest
let
us
thank
the
lord
for
his
bounties
all
for
the
brave
old
days
of
pleasure
and
pain
when
the
world
for
both
of
us
seem
too
small
though
the
love
was
void
and
the
hate
was
vain
though
the
word
was
bitter
between
us
twain
and
the
bitter
word
was
kin
to
the
blow
for
her
gloss
and
ripple
of
rich
gold
rain
for
her
velvet
crimson
and
satin
snow
though
we
never
shall
know
the
old
days
again
the
lord
his
mercy
is
great
men
say
his
wrath
men
say
is
a
burning
brand
let
us
praise
him
whether
he
save
or
slay
and
above
her
body
let
hand
join
hand
we
shall
meet
my
friend
in
the
spirit
land
will
our
strife
renew
nay
i
dare
not
trust
for
the
grim
great
gulf
that
can
not
be
will
divide
us
from
her
the
lord
is
just
she
shall
not
be
thrust
where
our
spirits
stand
a
basket
of
flowers
from
dawn
to
dusk
dawn
on
skies
still
and
starlit
white
lustres
take
hold
and
grey
flushes
scarlet
and
red
flashes
gold
and
cover
the
rose
shed
above
her
like
lover
and
lover
they
flame
and
unfold
still
bloom
in
the
garden
green
fresh
lawn
though
pasture
lands
harden
and
drought
fissures
yawn
while
leaves
not
a
few
fall
let
rose
leaves
for
you
fall
leaves
with
and
gold
shot
with
dawn
does
the
remember
the
fall
of
your
feet
in
autumn
red
ember
when
drought
leagues
with
heat
when
the
last
of
the
roses
despairingly
closes
in
the
lull
that
reposes
ere
storm
winds
wax
fleet
love
melodies
languish
in
chastelard
strain
and
abelard
anguish
is
love
pleasant
pain
and
sappho
rehearses
love
blessings
and
curses
in
passionate
verses
again
and
again
and
i
i
have
heard
of
all
these
long
ago
yet
never
one
word
of
their
i
know
not
under
my
finger
in
songs
of
the
singer
love
litanies
linger
love
rhapsodies
flow
fresh
flowers
in
a
basket
an
offering
to
you
though
you
did
not
ask
it
unbidden
i
strew
with
heat
and
drought
striving
some
blossoms
still
living
may
render
thanksgiving
for
dawn
and
for
dew
the
garlands
i
gather
the
rhymes
i
string
fast
are
hurriedly
rather
than
heedlessly
cast
yon
tree
shady
awning
is
and
warning
far
spent
is
the
morning
and
i
must
ride
fast
songs
empty
yet
airy
i
striven
to
write
for
failure
dear
mary
forgive
me
songs
and
flowers
may
beset
you
i
can
only
regret
you
while
the
soil
where
i
met
you
recedes
from
my
sight
for
the
sake
of
past
hours
for
the
love
of
old
times
take
a
basket
of
flowers
and
a
bundle
of
rhymes
though
all
the
bloom
perish
your
hand
can
cherish
while
churlish
and
bearish
the
chimes
and
eastward
by
looms
sadly
my
track
and
i
must
ride
forward
and
still
i
look
back
look
back
ah
how
vainly
for
while
i
see
plainly
my
hands
on
the
reins
lie
uncertain
and
slack
the
warm
wind
breathes
strong
breath
the
dust
dims
mine
eye
and
i
draw
one
long
breath
and
stifle
one
sigh
green
slopes
softly
shaded
have
flitted
and
faded
my
dreams
flit
as
they
did
and
dusk
lost
rose
end
my
story
dead
core
and
dry
husk
departed
thy
glory
and
tainted
thy
musk
night
spreads
her
dark
limbs
on
the
face
of
the
dim
sun
so
flame
fades
to
crimson
and
crimson
to
dusk
a
fragment
they
say
that
flowers
are
sweeter
in
perfume
than
when
untouched
by
deadly
dew
they
glowed
in
early
bloom
they
say
that
men
condemned
to
die
have
quaffed
the
sweetened
wine
with
higher
relish
than
the
juice
of
the
untampered
vine
they
say
that
in
the
witch
song
though
rude
and
harsh
it
be
there
blends
a
wild
mysterious
strain
of
weirdest
melody
and
i
believe
the
devil
voice
sinks
deeper
in
our
ear
than
any
whisper
sent
from
heaven
however
sweet
and
clear
end
of
bush
ballads
miscellaneous
poems
to
my
sister
lines
written
by
the
late
gordon
on
august
being
three
days
before
he
sailed
for
australia
across
the
trackless
seas
i
go
no
matter
when
or
where
and
few
my
future
lot
will
know
and
fewer
still
will
care
my
hopes
are
gone
my
time
is
spent
i
little
heed
their
loss
and
if
i
can
not
feel
content
i
can
not
feel
remorse
my
parents
bid
me
cross
the
flood
my
kindred
frowned
at
me
they
say
i
have
belied
my
blood
and
stained
my
pedigree
but
i
must
turn
from
those
who
chide
and
laugh
at
those
who
frown
i
can
not
quench
my
stubborn
pride
nor
keep
my
spirits
down
i
once
had
talents
fit
to
win
success
in
life
career
and
if
i
chose
a
part
of
sin
my
choice
has
cost
me
dear
but
those
who
brand
me
with
disgrace
will
scarcely
dare
to
say
they
spoke
the
taunt
before
my
face
and
went
unscathed
away
my
friends
will
miss
a
comrade
face
and
pledge
me
on
the
seas
who
shared
the
or
the
chase
or
follies
worse
than
these
a
careless
smile
a
parting
glass
a
hand
that
waves
adieu
and
from
my
sight
they
soon
will
pass
and
from
my
memory
too
i
loved
a
girl
not
long
ago
and
till
my
suit
was
told
i
thought
her
breast
as
fair
as
snow
was
very
near
as
cold
and
yet
i
spoke
with
feelings
more
of
recklessness
than
pain
those
words
i
never
spoke
before
nor
never
shall
again
her
cheek
grew
pale
in
her
dark
eye
i
saw
the
shine
her
red
lips
faltered
in
reply
and
then
were
pressed
to
mine
a
quick
pulsation
of
the
heart
a
flutter
of
the
breath
a
smothered
sob
and
thus
we
part
to
meet
no
more
till
death
and
yet
i
may
at
times
recall
her
memory
with
a
sigh
at
times
for
me
the
tears
may
fall
and
dim
her
sparkling
eye
but
absent
friends
are
soon
forgot
and
in
a
year
or
less
doubtless
be
another
lot
those
very
lips
to
press
with
adverse
fate
we
best
can
cope
when
all
we
prize
has
fled
and
where
there
little
left
to
hope
there
little
left
to
dread
oh
time
glides
ever
quickly
by
destroying
all
that
dear
on
earth
there
little
worth
a
sigh
and
nothing
worth
a
tear
what
fears
have
i
what
hopes
in
life
what
joys
can
i
command
a
few
short
years
of
toil
and
strife
in
a
strange
and
distant
land
when
green
grass
sprouts
above
this
clay
and
that
might
be
ere
long
some
friends
may
read
these
lines
and
say
the
world
has
judged
him
wrong
there
is
a
spot
not
far
away
where
my
young
sister
sleeps
who
seems
alive
but
yesterday
so
fresh
her
memory
keeps
for
we
have
played
in
childhood
there
beneath
the
hawthorn
bough
and
bent
our
knee
in
childish
prayer
i
can
not
utter
now
of
late
so
reckless
and
so
wild
that
spot
recalls
to
me
that
i
was
once
a
laughing
child
as
innocent
as
she
and
there
while
august
wild
wave
i
wandered
all
alone
strewed
blossoms
on
her
little
grave
and
knelt
beside
the
stone
i
seem
to
have
a
load
to
bear
a
heavy
choking
grief
could
i
have
forced
a
single
tear
i
might
have
felt
relief
i
think
my
hot
and
restless
heart
has
scorched
the
channels
dry
from
which
those
sighs
of
sorrow
start
to
moisten
cheek
and
eye
sister
farewell
farewell
once
more
to
every
youthful
tie
friends
parents
kinsmen
native
shore
to
each
and
all
and
thoughts
which
for
the
moment
seem
to
bind
me
with
a
spell
ambitious
hope
love
boyish
dream
to
you
a
last
farewell
the
old
leaven
a
dialogue
mark
so
maurice
you
sail
you
say
and
you
may
or
may
not
return
be
sociable
man
for
once
in
a
way
unless
you
too
old
to
learn
the
shadows
are
cool
by
the
water
side
where
the
willows
grow
by
the
pond
and
the
yellow
laburnum
drooping
pride
sheds
a
golden
gleam
beyond
for
the
blended
tints
of
the
summer
flowers
for
the
scents
of
the
summer
air
for
all
nature
charms
in
this
world
of
ours
is
little
or
naught
you
care
yet
i
know
for
certain
you
have
stirred
since
noon
from
your
chosen
spot
and
you
hardly
spoken
a
single
word
are
you
tired
or
cross
or
what
you
fretting
about
those
shares
you
bought
they
were
to
have
gone
up
fast
but
i
heard
how
they
fell
to
nothing
in
short
they
were
given
away
at
last
maurice
no
mark
i
not
so
easily
cross
is
true
that
i
had
a
run
of
bad
luck
lately
indeed
i
lost
well
somebody
else
has
won
mark
the
glass
has
fallen
perhaps
you
fear
a
return
of
your
ancient
stitch
that
souvenir
of
the
lady
mere
park
palings
and
double
ditch
maurice
you
wrong
i
not
in
the
least
afraid
of
that
if
the
truth
be
told
when
the
stiffness
visits
my
i
think
on
the
days
of
old
it
recalls
the
rush
of
the
freshening
wind
the
strain
of
the
chestnut
springing
and
the
rolling
thunder
of
hoofs
behind
like
the
rataplan
chorus
ringing
mark
are
you
bound
to
borrow
or
loth
to
lend
have
you
purchased
another
screw
or
backed
a
bill
for
another
friend
or
had
a
bad
night
at
loo
maurice
not
one
of
those
you
all
in
the
dark
if
you
choose
you
can
guess
again
but
you
better
give
over
guessing
mark
it
only
labour
in
vain
mark
i
try
once
more
does
it
plague
you
still
that
trifle
of
lead
you
carry
a
guest
that
lingers
against
your
will
unwelcome
yet
bound
to
tarry
maurice
not
so
that
burden
i
used
to
bear
is
seldom
it
gives
me
trouble
and
to
earn
it
as
i
did
then
and
there
i
carry
a
dead
weight
double
a
shock
like
that
for
a
splintered
rib
can
a
repay
as
the
swallow
skims
through
the
spider
web
we
rode
through
their
ranks
that
day
mark
come
maurice
you
escape
me
so
i
hazard
another
guess
that
girl
that
jilted
you
long
ago
you
thinking
of
her
confess
maurice
tho
the
blue
lake
flush
with
a
rosy
light
reflected
from
yonder
sky
might
conjure
a
vision
of
aphrodite
to
a
poet
or
painter
eye
tho
the
golden
drop
with
its
drooping
curl
between
the
water
and
wood
hangs
down
like
the
tress
of
a
wayward
girl
in
her
dreamy
maidenhood
such
boyish
fancies
seem
out
of
date
to
one
half
inclined
to
censure
their
folly
and
yet
your
shaft
flew
straight
though
you
drew
your
bow
at
a
venture
i
saw
my
lady
the
other
night
in
the
crowded
opera
hall
when
the
boxes
sparkled
with
faces
bright
i
knew
her
amongst
them
all
tho
little
for
these
things
now
i
reck
i
singled
her
from
the
throng
by
the
queenly
curves
of
her
head
and
neck
by
the
droop
of
her
eyelash
long
oh
passionless
placid
and
calm
and
cold
does
the
fire
still
lurk
within
that
lit
her
magnificent
eyes
of
old
and
coloured
her
marble
skin
for
a
weary
look
on
the
proud
face
hung
while
the
music
clash
and
swell
and
the
restless
child
to
the
silk
skirt
clung
unnoticed
tho
unrepelled
they
paled
those
rosebud
lips
that
i
kist
that
slim
waist
has
thickened
rather
and
the
cub
has
the
sprawling
mutton
fist
and
the
great
splay
foot
of
the
father
may
the
blight
mark
hold
hard
there
maurice
my
son
let
her
rest
since
her
spell
is
broken
we
can
neither
recall
deeds
rashly
done
nor
retract
words
hastily
spoken
maurice
time
was
when
to
pleasure
her
girlish
whim
in
my
blind
infatuation
i
freely
endangered
life
and
limb
aye
perilled
my
soul
salvation
mark
with
the
best
intentions
we
all
must
work
but
little
good
and
much
harm
be
a
christian
for
once
not
a
pagan
turk
nursing
wrath
and
keeping
it
warm
maurice
if
our
best
intentions
pave
the
way
to
a
place
that
is
somewhat
hot
can
our
worst
intentions
lead
us
say
to
a
still
more
sultry
spot
mark
is
said
that
charity
makes
amends
for
a
multitude
of
transgressions
maurice
but
our
perjured
loves
and
our
faithless
friends
are
entitled
to
no
concessions
mark
old
man
these
many
years
side
by
side
our
parallel
paths
have
lain
now
in
life
long
journey
diverging
wide
they
can
scarcely
unite
again
and
tho
from
all
that
i
seen
and
heard
you
prone
to
chafe
and
to
fret
at
the
least
restraint
not
one
angry
word
have
we
two
exchanged
as
yet
we
shared
our
peril
we
shared
our
sport
our
sunshine
and
gloomy
weather
feasted
and
flirted
and
fenced
and
fought
struggled
and
toiled
together
in
happier
moments
lighter
of
heart
stouter
of
heart
in
sorrow
we
met
and
we
parted
and
now
we
part
for
ever
perchance
she
a
matron
now
when
you
knew
her
first
she
was
but
a
child
and
your
hate
fostered
and
cherished
nourished
and
nursed
will
it
never
evaporate
your
grievance
is
known
to
yourself
alone
but
maurice
i
say
for
shame
if
in
ten
long
years
you
have
outgrown
to
an
ancient
flame
maurice
well
mark
you
right
if
i
spoke
in
spite
let
the
shame
and
the
blame
be
mine
at
the
risk
of
a
headache
we
drain
this
night
her
health
in
a
flask
of
wine
for
a
castle
in
spain
tho
it
never
was
built
for
a
dream
tho
it
never
came
true
for
a
cup
just
tasted
tho
rudely
spilt
at
least
she
can
hold
me
due
those
hours
of
pleasure
she
dealt
of
yore
as
well
as
those
hours
of
pain
i
ween
they
would
flit
as
they
flitted
before
if
i
had
them
over
again
against
her
no
word
from
my
lips
shall
pass
betraying
the
grudge
i
cherished
till
the
sand
runs
down
in
my
and
the
gift
of
my
speech
has
perished
say
why
is
the
spirit
of
peace
so
weak
and
the
spirit
of
wrath
so
strong
that
the
right
we
must
steadily
search
and
seek
tho
we
readily
find
the
wrong
mark
our
parents
of
old
entailed
the
curse
which
must
to
our
children
cling
let
us
hope
at
least
that
we
not
much
worse
than
the
founder
from
whom
we
spring
fit
sire
was
he
of
a
selfish
race
who
first
to
temptation
yielded
then
to
mend
his
case
tried
to
heap
disgrace
on
the
woman
he
should
have
shielded
say
comrade
mine
the
forbidden
fruit
we
have
plucked
that
i
well
believe
but
i
trust
we
rather
have
suffered
mute
than
have
laid
the
blame
upon
eve
maurice
yawning
who
knows
not
i
i
can
hardly
vouch
for
the
truth
of
what
little
i
see
and
now
if
you
any
weed
in
your
pouch
just
hand
it
over
to
me
an
exile
farewell
the
ocean
heaves
around
us
still
with
long
and
measured
swell
the
autumn
gales
our
canvas
fill
our
ship
rides
smooth
and
well
the
broad
atlantic
bed
of
foam
still
breaks
against
our
prow
i
shed
no
tears
at
quitting
home
nor
will
i
shed
them
now
against
the
bulwarks
on
the
poop
i
lean
and
watch
the
sun
behind
the
red
horizon
stoop
his
race
is
nearly
run
those
waves
will
never
quench
his
light
which
they
seem
to
close
he
will
rise
as
bright
as
he
this
morning
rose
how
brightly
gleams
the
orb
of
day
across
the
trackless
sea
how
lightly
dance
the
waves
that
play
like
dolphins
in
our
lee
the
restless
waters
seem
to
say
in
smothered
tones
to
me
how
many
thousand
miles
away
my
native
land
must
be
speak
ocean
is
my
home
the
same
now
all
is
new
to
me
the
tropic
sky
resplendent
flame
the
vast
expanse
of
sea
does
all
around
her
yet
unchanged
the
aspect
wear
oh
can
the
leagues
that
i
have
ranged
have
made
no
difference
there
how
vivid
recollection
hand
recalls
the
scene
once
more
i
see
the
same
tall
poplars
stand
beside
the
garden
door
i
see
the
hanging
still
and
where
my
sister
set
the
flowers
in
the
can
they
be
living
yet
let
woman
nature
cherish
grief
i
rarely
heave
a
sigh
before
emotion
takes
relief
in
listless
apathy
while
from
my
pipe
the
vapours
curl
towards
the
evening
sky
and
my
feet
the
billows
whirl
in
dull
monotony
the
sky
still
wears
the
crimson
streak
of
sol
departing
ray
some
briny
drops
are
on
my
cheek
is
but
the
salt
sea
spray
then
let
our
barque
the
ocean
roam
our
keel
the
billows
plough
i
shed
no
tears
at
quitting
home
nor
will
i
shed
them
now
early
adieux
adieu
to
kindred
hearts
and
home
to
pleasure
joy
and
mirth
a
fitter
foot
than
mine
to
roam
could
scarcely
tread
the
earth
for
they
are
now
so
few
indeed
not
more
than
three
in
all
who
will
think
of
me
or
heed
what
fate
may
me
befall
for
i
through
pleasure
paths
have
run
my
headlong
goal
to
win
nor
pleasure
snares
have
cared
to
shun
when
pleasure
sweetened
sin
let
those
who
will
their
failings
mask
to
mine
i
frankly
own
but
for
them
pardon
will
i
ask
of
none
save
heaven
alone
from
carping
friends
i
turn
aside
at
foes
defiance
frown
yet
time
may
tame
my
stubborn
pride
and
break
my
spirit
down
still
if
to
error
i
incline
truth
whispers
comfort
strong
that
never
reckless
act
of
mine
worked
a
comrade
wrong
my
mother
is
a
stately
dame
who
oft
would
chide
with
me
she
saith
my
riot
bringeth
shame
and
stains
my
pedigree
i
reck
not
what
my
friends
might
know
or
what
the
world
might
say
did
i
but
think
some
tears
would
flow
when
i
am
far
away
perchance
my
mother
will
recall
my
with
a
sigh
my
gentle
sister
tears
may
fall
and
dim
her
laughing
eye
perhaps
a
loving
thought
may
gleam
and
fringe
its
saddened
ray
when
like
a
nightmare
troubled
dream
i
outcast
pass
away
then
once
again
farewell
to
those
for
me
have
sighed
for
pleasures
melt
away
like
snows
and
hopes
like
shadows
glide
adieu
my
mother
if
no
more
thy
son
face
thou
see
at
least
those
many
cares
are
so
ofttimes
caused
by
me
my
lot
is
fixed
the
die
is
cast
for
me
home
hath
no
joy
oh
pardon
then
all
follies
past
and
bless
your
wayward
boy
and
thou
from
whom
for
aye
to
part
grieves
more
than
tongue
can
tell
may
heaven
preserve
thy
guileless
heart
sweet
sister
fare
thee
well
thou
too
whose
makes
my
resolution
less
while
from
the
bitter
past
it
takes
one
half
its
bitterness
if
you
held
my
dear
grant
this
request
i
pray
give
to
that
one
bright
tear
and
let
it
pass
away
a
hunting
song
here
a
health
to
every
sportsman
be
he
stableman
or
lord
if
his
heart
be
true
i
care
not
what
his
pocket
may
afford
and
may
he
ever
pleasantly
each
gallant
sport
pursue
if
he
takes
his
liquor
fairly
and
his
fences
fairly
too
he
cares
not
for
the
bubbles
of
fortune
fickle
tide
who
like
bendigo
can
battle
and
like
olliver
can
ride
he
laughs
at
those
who
caution
at
those
who
chide
he
frown
as
he
clears
a
paling
or
he
knocks
a
peeler
down
the
dull
cold
world
may
blame
us
boys
but
what
care
we
the
while
if
coral
lips
will
cheer
us
and
bright
eyes
on
us
smile
for
beauty
fond
caresses
can
most
tenderly
repay
the
weariness
and
trouble
of
many
an
anxious
day
then
fill
your
glass
and
drain
it
too
with
all
your
heart
and
soul
to
the
best
of
sports
the
the
fair
ones
and
the
bowl
to
a
stout
heart
in
adversity
through
every
ill
to
steer
and
when
fortune
smiles
a
score
of
friends
like
those
around
us
here
to
a
proud
beauty
a
valentine
though
i
have
loved
you
well
i
ween
and
you
too
fancied
me
your
heart
hath
too
divided
been
a
constant
heart
to
be
and
like
the
gay
and
youthful
knight
who
loved
and
rode
away
your
fleeting
fancy
takes
a
flight
with
every
fleeting
day
so
let
it
be
as
you
propose
tho
hard
the
struggle
be
is
fitter
far
that
goodness
knows
since
we
can
not
agree
let
quarrel
once
for
all
my
sweet
forget
the
past
and
then
i
kiss
each
pretty
girl
i
meet
while
you
flirt
with
the
men
thoughts
no
i
i
something
of
the
in
my
breed
the
spaniel
is
developed
somewhat
less
while
life
is
in
me
i
can
fight
and
bleed
but
never
the
chastising
hand
caress
you
say
the
stroke
was
well
intended
true
you
mention
it
was
meant
to
do
me
good
that
may
be
you
deserve
it
granted
too
then
take
it
kindly
no
i
never
could
how
many
a
resolution
to
amend
is
made
and
broken
as
the
years
run
round
and
how
can
others
on
your
word
depend
when
faithless
to
ourselves
we
often
found
i
often
swore
henceforward
i
reform
and
bid
my
vices
follies
all
take
wing
to
keep
my
promise
temptation
storm
i
always
found
was
quite
another
thing
i
saw
a
donkey
going
down
the
road
the
other
day
a
boy
was
on
his
back
who
on
the
quadruped
bestowed
with
a
stout
cudgel
many
a
hearty
thwack
but
lazier
and
lazier
grew
the
beast
until
he
dwindled
to
a
step
so
slow
that
i
felt
sure
take
him
at
the
least
full
one
blessed
mile
to
go
soliloquising
on
this
state
of
things
that
moke
like
me
i
muttered
with
a
sigh
he
might
go
faster
if
he
got
some
wings
but
nature
made
him
better
off
than
i
for
though
i
all
his
obstinacy
aye
all
his
sullen
spirit
and
his
dogged
ways
i
not
one
particle
however
small
of
that
praiseworthy
patience
he
displays
no
ii
a
man
is
independent
of
the
world
and
little
recks
of
strife
or
angry
brawl
if
a
host
his
banner
be
unfurled
be
his
heart
stout
it
matters
not
at
all
with
woman
is
not
so
for
she
seems
hurled
from
hand
to
hand
as
is
a
tennis
ball
how
queer
that
such
a
difference
should
be
between
a
human
he
and
human
she
no
iii
is
a
wicked
world
we
live
in
wrong
in
reason
wrong
in
rhyme
but
no
matter
we
not
give
in
while
we
still
can
come
to
time
strength
a
shadow
hope
is
madness
love
delusion
friendship
sham
pleasure
fades
away
to
sadness
none
of
these
are
worth
a
d
there
is
naught
on
earth
to
please
us
all
things
at
the
crisis
fail
friends
desert
us
bailiffs
tease
us
to
such
foes
we
give
but
a
stout
heart
still
maintaining
quells
the
ills
we
all
must
meet
and
a
spirit
fear
disdaining
lays
our
troubles
at
our
feet
so
we
surrender
tamely
to
the
ills
that
throng
us
fast

with

environ
the
danish
farms
where
i
sang
and
sported
in
childish
years
on
the
fourteenth
day
of
our
pilgrimage
we
stayed
at
the
foot
of
a
sandhill
high
our
fever
thirst
we
could
scarce
assuage
at
the
brackish
well
that
was
nearly
dry
and
the
hot
sun
rose
and
the
hot
sun
set
and
we
rode
all
the
day
through
a
desert
land
and
we
camp
where
the
lake
and
the
river
met
on
sedge
and
shingle
and
shining
sand
enfolded
in
hugo
cloak
i
slept
or
watch
the
stars
while
i
lay
awake
and
close
to
our
feet
the
staghound
crept
and
the
horses
were
grazing
beside
the
lake

worship
only
the

hugo
is
kind
and
constant

somewhat
given
to
studies
of

what
has
delayed
you
thus
thurston
both
by
sea
and
land
we
have
travell
far
yet
little
of
note
has
happened
to
us
we
were
wreck
on
the
shores
of
brittany
near
the
coast
of
morbihan
the
rocks
were
steep
and
the
surf
ran
high
thy
kinsman
eric
was
drown
by
a
swarm
of
knaves
we
were
next
beset
who
took
us
for
corsairs
then
released
by
a
breton
count
whose
name
i
forget
now
i
go
by
your
leave
to
tend
my
beast
he
goes
out
elspeth
that
man
is
rude
and
froward
of
speech
my
ears
are
good
though
my

grows

canst

dark
and

mountebank
pilgrim
or
wandering
bard
eustace
to
define
his
calling
is
somewhat
hard
lady
thora
has
taken
him
by
the
hand
because
he
has
come
from
the
holy
land
pilgrims
and
palmers
are
all
the
rage
with
her
since
she
shared
in
that
pilgrimage
with
hugo
the
stranger
came
yesterday
and
would
have
gone
on
but
she
bade
him
stay
besides
he
sings
in
the
danish
tongue
the
songs
she
has
heard
in
her
childhood
sung
that
all
i
know
of
him
good
or
bad
in
my
own
opinion
he
somewhat
mad
you
must
raise
your
voice
if
you
speak
with
him
and
he
answers
as
though
his
senses
were
dim
thurston
to
harold
sir
stranger
harold
friend
thurston
where
do
you
come
from
and
whither
wend
harold
i
have
travelled
of
late
with
the
setting
sun
at
my
back
and
as
soon
as
my
task
is
done
i
purpose
to
turn
my
face
to
the
north
yet
we
know
not
what
a
day
may
bring
forth
thurston
indeed
we
do
to
eustace
aside
nay
i
know
him
now
by
that
ugly
scar
that
crosses
his
brow
and
the
less
we
say
to
him
the
better
your
judgment
is
right
to
the
very
letter
the
man
is
mad
eustace
but
harmless
i
think
he
eats
but
little
eschews
strong
drink
and
only
speaks
when
spoken
to
first
thurston
harmless
or
not
he
was
once
the
worst
and
bitterest
foe
lord
hugo
had
and
yet
his
story
is
somewhat
sad
eustace
may
i
hear
it
thurston
nay
i
never
reveal
what
concerns
me
not
our
lord
may
conceal
or
divulge
at
pleasure
his
own
affairs
not
even
his
comrade
eric
shares
his
secrets
though
eric
thinks
him
wise
which
is
more
than
i
do
for
i
despise
that
foolish
science
he
learnt
in
rome
he
dreams
and
mopes
when
he
sits
at
home
and
now
he
not
much
better
abroad
is
hard
to
follow
so
tame
a
lord
us
two
he
wo
be
worth
a
rush
if
he
will
persist
in
his
studies
eustace
hush
ralph
has
persuaded
our
guest
to
sing
thurston
i
have
known
the
day
when
his
voice
would

is
pleasant
still

far
too
feeble

harold

on

the
wide
windings
of
the

tide
shall
i
in
my
shallop
glide
as
i
have
done
at

side
never

where
the
firs
pines

larches
quiver

stirs
shall
my
lips
be
press

hers
as
they
were
in
years
never
never
never
in

not

with
a
numerous
band
ere
the
snows
began
to
fall
and
slew
a
buck
on
your
lordship
land
within
a
league
of
the
wall
hugo
count
william
has
done
to
us
no
more
than
we
to
him
in
his
vineyard
last
summer
or
later
maybe
a
boar
was
slaughter
by
thurston
whinyard
thurston
aye
hugo
but
william
kept
the
buck
i
will
wager
marks
a
score
though
the
tale
is
new
to
me
and
worse
luck
you
made
me
give
back
the
boar
harold
advancing
lord
hugo
hugo
what
art
thou
living
yet
i
scarcely
knew
thee
sir
dane
and
is
not
so
very
long
since
we
met
harold
be
long
ere
we
meet
again
gives
a
letter
this
letter
was
traced
by
one
now
dead
in
the
holy
land
and
i
must
wait
till
his
dying
request
is
read
and
in
his
name
ask
the
reply
thora
aside
who
is
that
stranger
hugo
hugo
by
birth
he
is
a
countryman
of
thine
thora
what
writing
is
this
on
earth
i
can
scarce
decipher
a
line
harold
the
pen
in
the
clutch
of
death
works
hugo
nay
i
read
now
the
letters
run
more
clearly
harold
wilt
grant
the
request
hugo
i
will
harold
enough
then
my
task
is
done
he
holds
out
his
hand
hugo
i
go
to
a
land
wilt
thou
say
god
speed
thee
now
hugo
sir
harold
i
can
not
take
thy
hand
because
of
my
ancient
vow
harold
farewell
then
thora
friend
till
the
morning
wait
on
so
wild
a
night
as
this
thou
shalt
not
go
from
my
husband
gate
the
path
thou
wilt
surely
miss
harold
i
go
kind
lady
some
future
day
thy
care
will
requited
be
thora
speak
hugo
speak
hugo
he
may
go
or
stay
it
matters
little
to
me
harold
goes
out
thora
husband
that
man
is
ill
and
weak
on
foot
he
goes
and
alone
through
a
barren
moor
in
a
bleak
eric
now
i
wonder
where
he
has
gone
hugo
indeed
i
have
not
the
least
idea
the
man
is
certainly
mad
he
wedded
my
sister
dorothea
and
used
her
cruelly
bad
he
was
once
my
firmest
and
surest
friend
and
once
my
deadliest
foe
but
hate
and
friendship
both
find
their
end
now
i
heed
not
where
he
may
go
scene
a
chamber
in
the
castle
hugo
thora
and
eric
hugo
that
letter
that
came
from
palestine
by
the
hands
of
yon
wandering
dane
will
cost
me
a
pilgrimage
to
the
rhine
thora
wilt
thou
travel
so
soon
again
hugo
i
can
scarce
refuse
the
dying
request
of
my
comrade
baldwin
now
his
bones
are
dust
may
his
soul
find
rest
he
once
made
a
foolish
vow
that
at
englemehr
the
watchful
care
of
the
abbess
his
child
should
stay
for
a
season
at
least
to
escort
her
there
i
must
start
at
the
break
of
day
thora
is
it
agatha
that
goes
or
clare
hugo
nay
clare
is
dwelling
in
spain
with
her
spouse
thora
is
agatha
she
is
fair
i
am
told
but
giddy
and
vain
eric
some
musty
tales
on
my
memory
grow
concerning
count
baldwin
vow
thou
his
daughter
hugo
aye
years
ago
i
should
scarcely
know
her
now
it
seems
when
her
father
vow
was
made
she
was
taken
sorely
ill
then
he
travell
and
on
his
return
was
stay
he
could
never
his
oath
fulfil
eric
if
rightly
i
heard
was
agatha
that
fled
with
some
danish
knight
i
forget
the
name
hugo
nay
she
fled
not
far
she
returned
again
that
night
thora
for
a
nun
i
fear
she
is
too
hugo
that
is
no
affair
of
mine
my
task
is
over
my
word
fulfilled
should
i
bring
her
safe
to
the
rhine
come
thora
sing
thora
nay
i
can
not
sing
nor
would
i
now
if
i
could
sing
thou
hugo
i
will
though
my
voice
should
bring
no
sound
save
a
discord
rude
sings
where
the
storm
in
its
wrath
hath
lighted
the
pine
lies
low
in
the
dust
and
the
corn
is
withered
and
blighted
where
the
fields
are
red
with
the
rust
falls
the
black
frost
nipping
and
killing
where
its
petals
the
violet
rears
and
the
wind
though
tempered
is
chilling
to
the
lamb
despoiled
by
the
shears
the
strong
in
their
strength
are
shaken
the
wise
in
their
wisdom
fall
and
the
bloom
of
beauty
is
taken
strength
wisdom
beauty
and
all
they
vanish
their
lot
fulfilling
their
doom
approaches
and
nears
but
the
wind
though
tempered
is
chilling
to
the
lamb
despoiled
by
the
shears
is
the
will
of
a
great
creator
he
is
wise
his
will
must
be
done
and
it
cometh
sooner
or
later
and
one
shall
be
taken
and
one
shall
be
left
here
toiling
and
tilling
in
this
vale
of
sorrows
and
tears
where
the
wind
though
tempered
is
chilling
to
the
lamb
despoiled
by
the
shears
tell
me
mine
own
one
tell
me
the
shadows
of
life
and
the
fears
shall
neither
daunt
me
nor
quell
me
while
i
can
avert
thy
tears
dost
thou
shrink
as
i
shrink
unwilling
to
realise
lonely
years
since
the
wind
though
tempered
is
chilling
to
the
lamb
despoiled
by
the
shears
enter
henry
henry
my
lord
father
luke
craves
audience
straight
he
has
come
on
foot
from
the
chapel
some
stranger
perished
beside
his
gate
when
the
dawn
began
to
dapple
scene
a
chapel
not
very
far
from
hugo
castle
hugo
eric
and
two
monks
luke
and
hubert
the
dead
body
of
harold
luke
when
the
dawn
was
breaking
came
a
faint
sound
waking
hubert
and
myself
we
hurried
to
the
door
found
the
stranger
lying
at
the
threshold
dying
somewhere
have
i
seen
a
face
like
his
before
hugo
harold
he
is
hight
only
from
our
gates
he
wander
in
the
driving
hail
well
his
face
i
know
both
as
friend
and
foe
of
my
followers
only
thurston
knows
his
tale
luke
few
the
words
he
said
faint
the
signs
he
made
twice
or
thrice
he
groaned
quoth
hubert
thou
hast
sinn
this
is
retribution
seek
for
absolution
answer
me
then
cast
thy
sorrows
to
the
wind
do
their
voices
reach
thee
friends
who
failed
to
teach
thee
in
thine
earlier
days
to
sunder
right
from
wrong
charges
thee
cited
cares
all
unrequited
counsels
spurned
and
slighted
do
they
press
and
throng
but
he
shook
his
head
is
not
so
he
said
they
will
scarce
reproach
me
who
reproached
of
yore
if
their
counsels
good
rashly
i
withstood
having
suffered
longer
i
have
suffered
more
do
their
curses
stun
thee
foes
who
failed
to
shun
thee
stricken
by
rash
vengeance
in
some
wild
career
as
the
barbed
arrow
cleaveth
bone
and
marrow
from
those
chambers
narrow
do
they
pierce
thine
ear
and
he
made
reply
laughing
bitterly
did
i
fear
them
living
shall
i
fear
them
dead
blood
that
i
have
spilt
leaveth
little
guilt
on
the
hand
it
resteth
scarcely
on
the
head
is
there
one
whom
thou
have
wronged
ere
now
since
remorse
so
sorely
weigheth
down
thine
heart
by
some
saint
in
heaven
sanctified
and
shriven
thou
be
forgiven
ere
thy
soul
depart
not
a
word
he
said
but
he
bowed
his
head
till
his
temples
rested
on
the
chilly
sods
and
we
heard
him
groan
ah
mine
own
mine
own
if
i
had
thy
pardon
i
might
ask
for
god
hubert
raised
him
slowly
sunrise
faint
and
holy
lit
the
dead
face
placid
as
a
child
might
be
may
the
troubled
spirit
through
christ
saving
merit
peace
and
rest
inherit
thus
we
sent
for
thee
hugo
god
fate
i
had
cause
for
hate
in
this
very
chapel
years
back
proud
and
strong
joined
by
priestly
vows
he
became
the
spouse
of
my
youngest
sister
to
her
bitter
wrong
and
he
wrought
her
woe
making
me
his
foe
not
alone
unfaithful
brutal
too
was
he
she
had
scarce
been
dead
three
months
ere
he
fled
with
count
baldwin
daughter
then
betrothed
to
me
fortune
straight
forsook
him
vengeance
overtook
him
heavy
crimes
will
bring
down
heavy
punishment
all
his
strength
was
shatter
even
his
wits
were
scatter
wandering
he
went
we
are
unforgiving
while
our
foes
are
living
yet
his
retribution
weigh
so
heavily
that
i
feel
remorse
gazing
on
his
corpse
for
my
rudeness
when
he
left
our
gates
to
die
and
his
grave
shall
be
the
chestnut
tree
where
he
met
my
sister
many
years
ago
leave
that
tress
of
hair
on
his
bosom
there
wrap
the
cerecloth
round
him
eric
let
us
go
scene
a
room
in
the
castle
hugo
and
eric
early
morning
hugo
the
morn
is
fair
the
weary
miles
will
shorten
the
summer
wiles
pomona
in
the
orchard

and
in
the
meadow
flora
and
i
have
roused
a
chosen
band
for
escort
through
the
troubled
land
and
shaken
elspeth
by
the
hand
and
said
farewell
to
thora
comrade
and
kinsman
for
thou
art
comrade
and
kin
to
me
we
part
ere
nightfall
if
at
once
we
start
we
gain
the
dead
count
castle
the
roads
are
fair
the
days
are
fine
ere
long
i
hope
to
reach
the
rhine
forsooth
no
friend
to
me
or
mine
is
that
same
abbot
basil
i
thought
he
wronged
us
by
his
greed
my
father
sign
a
foolish
deed
for
lack
of
gold
in
time
of
need
and
thus
our
lands
went
by
us
yet
wrong
on
our
side
may
have
been
as
far
as
my
will
goes
i
ween
is
past
the
grudge
that
lay
between
us
twain
men
call
him
pious
and
i
have
prosper
much
since
then
and
gain
for
one
lost
acre
ten
and
even
the
ancient
house
and
glen
rebought
with
he
too
is
wealthy
he
has
got
by
churchly
rights
a
fertile
spot
a
land
of
corn
and
wine
i
wot
a
land
of
milk
and
honey
now
eric
change
thy
plans
and
ride
with
us
thou
hast
no
ties
no
bride
eric
nay
ties
i
have
and
time
and
tide
thou
knowest
wait
for
no
man
and
i
go
north
god
blessing
shuns
the
dwellings
of
forgetful
sons
that
proverb
he
may
read
who
runs
in
christian
lore
or
roman
my
good
old
mother
she
hath
heard
for
twelve
long
months
from
me
no
word
at
thought
of
her
my
heart
is
stirr
and
even
mine
eyes
grow
moister
greet
ursula
from
me
her
fame
is
known
to
all
a
nobler
dame
since
days
of
clovis
became
the
inmate
of
a
cloister
our
paths
diverge
yet
we
may
go
together
for
a
league
or
so
i
too
will
join
thy
band
below
when
thou
thy
bugle
windest
eric
goes
out
hugo
from
weaknesses
we
stand
afar
on
us
unpleasantly
they
jar
and
yet
the
are
the
gentlest
and
the
kindest
my
mother
loved
me
tenderly
alas
her
only
son
was
i
shudder
but
my
lids
were
dry
by
death
made
orphan
newly
a
braver
man
than
me
i
swear
who
never
comprehended
fear
scarce
names
his
mother
and
the
tear
unbidden
springs
unruly
scene
a
road
on
the
norman
frontiers
hugo
agatha
orion
thurston
and
armed
attendants
riding
slowly
agatha
sir
knight
what
makes
you
so
grave
and
glum
at
times
i
fear
you
are
deaf
or
dumb
or
both
hugo
and
yet
should
i
speak
the
truth
there
is
little
in
common
us
forsooth
you
would
think
me
duller
and
still
more
vain
if
i
uttered
the
thoughts
that
fill
my
brain
since
the
matters
with
which
my
mind
is
laden
would
scarcely
serve
to
amuse
a
maiden
agatha
i
am
so
foolish
and
you
are
so
wise
is
the
meaning
your
words
so
ill
disguise
alas
my
prospects
are
sad
enough
i
had
rather
listen
to
speeches
rough
than
muse
and
meditate
silently
on
the
coming
loss
of
my
liberty
sad
hope
to
me
can
my
future
bring
yet
while
i
may
i
would
prattle
and
sing
though
it
only
were
to
try
and
assuage
the
dreariness
of
my
pilgrimage
hugo
prattle
and
sing
to
your
heart
content
and
none
will
offer
impediment
agatha
sings
we
were
playmates
in
childhood
my
sister
and
i
whose
playtime
with
childhood
is
done
through
thickets
where
briar
and
bramble
grew
high
barefooted
i
oft
seen
her
run
i
known
her
when
mists
on
the
moorland
hung
white
bareheaded
past
nightfall
remain
she
has
followed
a
landless
and
penniless
knight
through
battles
and
sieges
in
spain
but
i
pulled
the
flower
and
shrank
from
the
thorn
sought
the
sunshine
and
fled
from
the
mist
my
sister
was
born
to
face
hardship
with
scorn
i
was
born
to
be
fondled
and
kiss
hugo
aside
she
has
a
sweet
voice
orion
and
a
sweet
face
too
be
candid
for
once
and
give
her
her
due
agatha
your
face
grows
longer
and
still
more
long
sir
scholar
how
did
you
like
my
song
hugo
i
thought
it
rather
a
silly
one
agatha
you
are
far
from
a
pleasant
companion
scene
an
apartment
in
a
wayside
inn
hugo
and
agatha
evening
hugo
i
will
leave
you
now
we
have
talked
enough
and
for
one
so
tenderly
reared
and
nursed
this
journey
is
wearisome
perhaps
and
rough
agatha
will
you
not
finish
your
story
first
hugo
i
repent
me
that
i
began
it
now
is
a
dismal
tale
for
a
maiden
ears
your
cheek
is
pale
already
your
brow
is
sad
and
your
eyes
are
moist
with
tears
agatha
it
may
be
thus
i
am
lightly
vexed
but
the
tears
will
lightly
come
and
go
i
can
cry
one
moment
and
laugh
the
next
yet
i
have
seen
terrors
as
well
you
know
i
remember
that
flight
through
moss
and
fern
the
moonlit
shadows
the
hoofs
that
rolled
in
fierce
pursuit
and
the
ending
stern
and
the
hawk
that
left
his
prey
on
the
wold
hugo
i
have
sorrowed
since
that
i
left
you
there
your
friends
were
close
behind
on
the
heath
though
not
so
close
as
i
thought
they
were
aside
now
i
will
not
tell
her
of
harold
death
agatha
is
true
i
was
justly
punished
and
men
as
a
rule
of
pity
have
little
share
had
i
died
you
had
cared
but
little
then
hugo
but
little
then
yet
now
i
should
care
more
than
you
think
for
now
tears
still
ere
i
leave
you
child
alone
must
i
dry
your
cheeks
agatha
nay
i
am
not
quite
such
a
child
but
what
i
can
dry
my
own
hugo
goes
out
agatha
retires

singing
outside
the
window
of
agatha
chamber
the
stems
with
blossoms
laden
the
tendrils
curling

thy
servant

oh
maiden
i
thy

oh

lo
the

that
slew
the
red

sitting

evening
hugo
and
now
the
parting
is
over
the
parting
should
end
the
pain
and
the
restless
heart
may
recover
and
so
may
the
troubled
brain
i
am
sitting
within
the
chamber
whose
windows
look
on
the
porch
where
the
roses
cluster
and
clamber
we
halted
here
on
our
march
with
her
to
the
convent
going
and
now
i
go
back
alone
ye
roses
budding
and
blowing
ye
heed
not
though
she
is
flown
i
remember
the
girlish
gesture
the
sportive
and
childlike
grace
with
which
she
crumpled
and
pressed
your
rose
leaves
to
her
face
shall
i
think
on
her
ways
hereafter
on
those
flashes
of
mirth
and
grief
on
that
april
of
tears
and
laughter
on
our
parting
bitterly
brief
i
remember
the
bell
at
sunrise
that
sounded
so
solemnly
bidding
monk
and
prelate
and
nun
rise
i
rose
ere
the
sun
was
high
down
the
long
dark
dismal
passage
to
the
door
of
her
i
went
on
a
farewell
message
i
trod
with
a
stealthy
pace
there
was
no
one
there
to
see
us
when
she
opened
her
chamber
door
miserere
mei
deus
rang
faint
from
the
convent
choir
i
remember
the
dark
and
narrow
and
room
and
the
gleam
like
a
golden
arrow
the
gleam
that
lighted
the
gloom
one
couch
one
seat
and
one
table
one
window
and
only
one
it
stands
in
the
eastern
gable
it
faces
the
rising
sun
one
ray
shot
through
it
and
one
light
on
doorway
and
threshold
played
she
stood
within
in
the
sunlight
i
stood
without
in
the
shade
i
remember
that
bright
form
under
the
sheen
of
that
slanting
ray
i
spoke
for
life
we
must
sunder
let
us
sunder
without
delay
let
us
sever
without
preamble
as
brother
and
sister
part
for
the
sake
of
one
pleasant
ramble
that
will
live
in
at
least
one
heart
still
the
choir
in
my
ears
rang
faintly
in
the
distance
dying
away
sweetly
and
sadly
and
saintly
through
arch
and
corridor
grey
and
thus
we
parted
for
ever
between
the
shade
and
the
shine
not
as
brother
and
sister
sever
i
fondled
her
hands
in
mine
still
the
choir
in
my
ears
rang
and
dull
though
audible
yet
and
she
redden
and
paled
and
redden
her
lashes
and
lids
grew
wet
not
as
brother
severs
from
sister
my
lips
clung
fast
to
her
lips
she
shivered
and
shrank
when
i
kissed
her
on
the
sunbeam
drooped
the
eclipse
i
remember
little
of
the
parting
with
the
abbot
down
by
the
gate
my
men
were
eager
for
starting
i
think
he
pressed
me
to
wait
from
the
lands
where
convent
and
glebe
lie
from
manors
and
church
right
where
i
fought
temptation
so
feebly
i
too
felt
eager
for
flight
alas
the
parting
is
over
the
parting
but
not
the
pain
oh
sweet
was
the
purple
clover
and
sweet
was
the
yellow
grain
and
sweet
were
the
woody
hollows
on
the
summery
rhineward
track
but
a
winter
untimely
swallows
all
sweets
as
i
travel
back
yet
i
feel
assured
in
some
fashion
ere
the
hedges
are
crisp
with
rime
i
shall
conquer
this
senseless
passion
yield
to
toil
and
to
time
i
will
fetter
these
fancies
roaming
already
the
sun
has
dipped
i
will
trim
the
lamps
in
the
gloaming
i
will
finish
my
manuscript
through
the
nightwatch
unflagging

banish
regrets

soon
as
the

is

frighten

you
had
better
ask
some
learned

opinion

worth

much

mine

besides

tell
you

hugo
from
the
smoky
altar
there
seems
to
come
a
stifled
murmur
a
droning
hum
orion
with
that
we
have
nothing
at
all
to
do
or
at

not
now
neither
i
nor
you
though
some
day
or
other
possibly
we
may
see
it
closer
both
you
and
i
let
us
visit
the
nearest
altar
first
whence
the
yellow
fires
flicker
and
burst
like
the
flames
from
molten
ore
that
spring
we
may
stand
in
the
pale
of
the
outer
ring
but
forbear
to
trespass
within
the
inner
lest
the
sins
of
the
past
should
find
out
the
sinner
they
approach
the
first
altar
and
stand
within
the
outer
circle
which
surrounds
it
and
near
the
inner
spirits
sing
beneath
us
it
flashes
the
glittering
gold
though
it
turneth
to
ashes
and
dross
in
the
hold
yet
man
will
endeavour
by
fraud
or
by
strife
to
grasp
it
and
never
to
yield
it
with
life
orion
what
can
you
see
hugo
some
decrepit
shapes
that
are
neither
dwarfs
nor
demons
nor
apes
in
the
hollow
earth
they
appear
to
store
and
rake
together
great
heaps
of
orion
these
are
the
gnomes
coarse
sprites
and
rough
come
on
of
these
we
have
seen
enough
they
approach
second
altar
and
stand
as
before
spirits
singing
above
us
it
flashes
the
glittering
steel
though
the
red
blood
splashes
where
its
victims
reel
yet
man
will
endeavour
to
grapple
the
hilt
and
to
wield
the
blade
ever
till
his
life
be
spilt
orion
what
see
you
now
hugo
a
rocky
glen
a
horrid
jumble
of
fighting
men
and
a
face
that
somewhere
i
seen
before
orion
come
on
there
is
naught
worth
seeing
more
except
the
altar
of
ashtaroth
hugo
to
visit
that
altar
i
am
loth
orion
why
so
hugo
nay
i
can
not
fathom
why
but
i
feel
no
curiosity
orion
come
on
stand
close
to
the
inner
ring
and
hear
how
sweetly
these
spirits
sing
they
approach
third
altar
spirits
sing
around
us
it
flashes
the
cestus
of
one
born
of
white
foam
that
dashes
beneath
the
white
sun
let
the
mortal
take
heart
he
has
nothing
to
dare
she
is
fair
queen
astarte
her
subjects
are
fair
orion
what
see
you
now
friend
hugo
wood
and
wold
and
forms
that
look
like
the
nymphs
of
old
there
is
nothing
here
worth
looking
at
twice
i
have
seen
enough
orion
you
are
far
too
nice
nevertheless
you
must
look
again
those
forms
will
fade
hugo
they
are
growing
less
plain
they
vanish
i
see
a
door
that
seems
to
open
a
ray
of
sunlight
gleams
from
a
window
behind
a
vision
as
fair
as
the
flush
of
dawn
is
standing
there
he
gazes
earnestly
orion
sings
higher
and
hotter
the
white
flames
glow
and
the
adamant
may
be
thaw
like
snow
and
the
life
for
a
single
chance
may
go
and
the
soul
for
a
certainty
oh

thou
hast
sought

fly

the
furnace
is
heated
till
sevenfold
is
thy
brain
still
calm

thy
blood
still
cold
to
the
curls
that
wander
in
ripples
of
gold
on
the
shoulders
of
ivory
do
the
large
dark
eyes
and
the
small
red
mouth
consume
thine
heart
with
a
fiery
drouth

fierce
sirocco
that
sweeps
from
the
south
when
the
deserts
are

aye
start
and

and

thy
breath
the
sting

the
venom

scales
are
flashing
the
fruit
beneath

suddenly
at

core
the

dead

we

we

to
look

glory
nor

will
our

return
to

with
heavier
gold

with

will
our

furnish

with

we
have
travell
too
far
we
have
tarried
too
long
say
captains
all
is
there
ever
a
village
for
miles
around
that
is
worth
the
pillage
will
it
pay
the
costs
of
my

or
yours
to
harry
the

of

boors
have
we
cause
for
pride
in
our
feats
of

when
we
plunder
the

or
sack

i
tell
thee
rudolph
of
rothenstein
that
were
thy
soldiers
willing
as
mine
and
i
sole
leader
of
this
array
i
would
give

otto
battle
this

dost
thou
call
thy
followers
men
of

oh
dagobert
thou
whose
ancestor
on
the
neck
of
the
caesar
offspring
trod
who
was
justly
surnamed
the
scourge
of
god
yet
in
flight
lies

teuton
and

from
the

to
the

and
back
to
the
banks
of
the
rhine
once
more
retreat
from
the
face
of
an
armed
foe
robbing
garden
and
you
go
let
the
short
alliance
betwixt
us
cease
i
and
my
norsemen
will
go
in
peace
i
wot
it
never
will
suit
with
us
such
existence
tame
and
inglorious
i
could
live
no
worse
living
and
better
with
half
my
men
disbanded
rudolph
jarl
osric
what
thou
have
me
do
otto
army
our
men
count
few
with
one
chance
of
victory
fight
say
i
but
not
when
defeat
is
a
certainty
if
rudiger
joins
us
with
his
our
chance
will
be
equal
to
many
chances
for
rudiger
is
both
prompt
and
wary
and
his
men
are
gallant
though
mercenary
but
the
knave
refuses
to
send
a
lance
till
half
the
money
is
paid
in
advance
dagobert
may
his
avarice
wither
him
like
a
curse
i
guess
he
has
heard
of
our
late
reverse
but
rudolph
whether
he
goes
or
stays
there
is
reason
in
what
jarl
osric
says
of
provisions
we
need
a
fresh
supply
and
our
butts
and
flasks
are
shallow
or
dry
my
men
are
beginning
to
grumble
sadly
is
no
wonder
since
they
must
fare
so
badly
rudolph
we
have
plenty
of
foragers
out
and
still
we
have
plenty
of
hungry
mouths
to
fill
and
moreover
by
some
means
foul
or
fair
we
must
raise
money
is
little
i
care
so
long
as
we
raise
it
whence
it
comes
osric
shall
we
sit
till
nightfall
biting
our
thumbs
the
shortest
plan
is
ever
the
best
has
anyone
here
got
aught
to
suggest
orion
the
cornfields
are
golden
that
skirt
the
rhine
fat
are
the
oxen
strong
is
the
wine
in
those
pleasant
pastures
those
cellars
deep
that
with
the
tears
that
those
vineyards
weep
is
it
silver
you
stand
in
need
of
or
gold
ingot
or
coin
there
is
wealth
untold
in
the
ancient
convent
of
englemehr
that
is
not
so
very
far
from
here
the
abbot
esteem
a
holy
man
will
hold
what
he
has
and
grasp
what
he
can
the
cream
of
the
soil
he
loves
to
skim
why
not
levy
a
contribution
on
him
dagobert
the
stranger
speaks
well
not
far
away
that
convent
lies
and
one
summer
day
will
suffice
for
a
horseman
to
reach
the
gate
the
garrison
soon
would
capitulate
since
the
armed
retainers
are
next
to
none
and
the
walls
i
wot
may
be
quickly
won
rudolph
i
kept
those
walls
for
two
months
or
more
when
they
feared
the
riders
of
melchior
that
was
little
over
three
years
ago
their
abbot
is
thrifty
as
well
i
know
he
haggled
sorely
about
the
price
of
our
service
dagobert
rudolph
he
paid
thee
twice
rudolph
well
what
of
that
since
then
i
tried
to
borrow
from
him
now
i
know
he
lied
when
he
told
me
he
could
not
spare
the
sum
i
asked
if
we
to
his
gates
should
come
he
could
spare
it
though
it
were
doubled
and
still
this
war
with
the
church
i
like
it
osric
the
creed
of
our
fathers
is
dead
and
the
creed
of
the
christian
reigns
in
its
stead
but
the
creed
of
the
christian
too
may
die
for
your
creeds
or
your
churches
what
care
i
if
there
be
plunder
at
englemehr
let
us
strike
our
tents
and
thitherward
steer

what
hugo
still
at
the
rhine
i
thought
you
were
home
you
have
travell
by
stages
short
hugo
with
hesitation
our
homeward
march
was
labour
in
vain
we
had
to
retrace
our
steps
again
it
was
here
or
hereabouts
that
i
lost
some
papers
of
value
at
any
cost
i
must
find
them
and
which
way
lies
your
course
eric
i
go
to
recruit
prince
otto
force
i
can
not
study
as
you
do
i
am
wearied
with
inactivity
so
i
carry
a
blade
engrim
with
rust
that
a
hand
has
i
trust
not
quite
forgotten
the
way
to
wield
to
strike
once
more
on
the
tented
field
hugo
fighting
is
all
a
mistake
friend
eric
and
has
been
so
since
the
age
homeric
when
greece
was
shaken
and
troy
undone
ten
thousand
lives
for
a
worthless
one
yet
i
blame
you
not
you
might
well
do
worse
better
fight
and
perish
than
live
to
curse
the
day
you
were
born
and
such
has
been
the
lot
of
many
and
shall
i
ween
be
the
lot
of
more
if
thurston
chooses
he
may
go
with
you
the
blockhead
abuses
me
and
the
life
i
lead
enter
orion
orion
great
news
the
englemehr
monks
will
shake
in
their
shoes
in
the
soles
of
their
callous
feet
will
shake
the
barefooted
friars
the
nuns
will
quake
hugo
wherefore
orion
the
outlaw
of
rothenstein
has
come
with
his
soldiers
to
the
rhine
back
by
those
hardy
adventurers
from
the
northern
forests
of
pines
and
firs
and
dagobert
horse
they
march
as
straight
as
the
eagle
swoops
to
the
convent
gate
hugo
we
must
do
something
to
save
the
place
orion
they
are
sure
to
take
it
in
any
case
unless
the
sum
that
they
ask
is
paid
eric
some
effort
on
our
part
must
be
made
hugo
is
not
so
much
for
the
monks
i
care
eric
nor
i
but
the
abbess
and
nuns
are
there
orion
is
not
our
business
what
can
we
do
they
are
too
many
and
we
are
too
few
and
yet
i
suppose
you
will
save
if
you
can
that
lady
your
ward
or
your
kinswoman
hugo
she
is
no
kinswoman
of
mine
how
far
is
otto
camp
from
the
rhine
orion
too
far
for
help
in
such
time
of
need
to
be
brought
though
you
used
your
utmost
speed
eric
nay
that
i
doubt
hugo
and
how
many
men
have
they
orion
to
your
one
they
could
muster
ten
eric
i
know
count
rudolph
and
terms
may
be
made
with
him
i
fancy
for
though
his
trade
is
a
rough
one
now
gainsay
it
who
can
he
was
once
a
knight
and
a
gentleman
and
dagobert
the
chief
of
the
huns
bad
as
he
is
will
spare
the
nuns
though
neither
he
nor
the
count
could
check
those
lawless
men
should
they
storm
and
sack
the
convent
jarl
osric
too
i
know
he
is
rather
a
formidable
foe
and
will
likely
enough
be
troublesome
but
the
others
i
trust
to
terms
will
come
hugo
eric
how
many
men
have
you
i
can
count
a
score
eric
i
have
only
two
hugo
at
every
hazard
we
must
try
to
save
the
nuns
eric
count
rudolph
shall
think
we
have
a
force
that
almost
equals
his
own
if
i
can
confer
with
him
alone
orion
he
is
close
at
hand
by
this
time
he
waits
the
abbot
reply
at
the
convent
gates
hugo
we
had
better
send
him
a
herald
eric
nay
i
will
go
myself
eric
goes
out
hugo
orion
stay
so
this
is
the
reed
on
which
i
leaned
these
are
the
hopes
thou
hast
fostered
these
the
flames
thou
hast
fanned
oh
lying
fiend
is
it
thus
thou
dost
keep
thy
promises
orion
strong
language
hugo
and
most
unjust
you
will
cry
out
before
you
are
hurt
you
will
live
to
recall
your
words
i
trust
fear
nothing
from
osric
or
dagobert
these
are
your
friends
if
you
only
knew
it
and
would
take
the
advice
of
a
friend
sincere
neglect
his
counsels
and
you
must
rue
it
for
i
know
by
a
sign
the
crisis
is
near
accept
the
terms
of
these
outlaws
all
and
be
thankful
that
things
have
fallen
out
exactly
as
you
would
have
had
them
fall
you
may
save
the
one
that
you
care
about
otherwise
how
did
you
hope
to
gain
access
to
her
on
what
pretence
what
were
the
schemes
that
worried
your
brain
to
tempt
her
there
or
to
lure
her
thence
you
must
have
bungled
and
raised
a
scandal
about
your
ears
that
might
well
have
shamed
the
rudest
hun
the
veriest
vandal
long
or
ever
the
bird
was
tamed
hugo
the
convent
is
scarce
surrounded
yet
we
might
reach
and
hold
it
against
their
force
till
another
sun
has
risen
and
set
and
should
i
despatch
my
fleetest
horse
to
otto
orion
for
abbot
or
monk
or
friar
between
ourselves
is
little
you
care
if
their
halls
are
harried
by
steel
and
fire
their
avarice
left
your
heritage
bare
forsake
them
mitres
and
cowls
and
hoods
will
cover
vices
while
earth
endures
through
the
green
and
gold
of
the
summer
woods
ride
out
with
that
pretty
bird
of
yours
if
again
you
fail
to
improve
your
chance
why
then
my
friend
i
can
only
say
you
are
duller
far
than
the
dullest
lance
that
rides
in
dagobert
troop
this
day
faemina
semper
frown
not
thus
the
girl
was
always
giddy
and
wild
vain
and
foolish
and
frivolous
since
she
fled
from
her
father
halls
a
child
i
sought
to
initiate
you
once
in
the
mystic
lore
of
the
old
chaldean
but
i
found
you
far
too
stubborn
a
dunce
and
your
tastes
are
coarser
and
more
plebeian
yet
mark
my
words
for
i
read
the
stars
and
trace
the
future
in
yonder
sky
to
the
right
are
wars
and
rumours
of
wars
to
the
left
are
peace
and
prosperity
fear
naught
the
world
shall
never
detect
the
cloven
hoof
so
carefully
hid
by
the
scholar
so
staid
and
circumspect
so
wise
for
once
to
do
as
he
bid
remember
what
pangs
come
year
by
year
for
opportunity
that
has
fled
and
thora
in
ignorance
hugo
name
not
her
i
am
sorely
tempted
to
strike
thee
dead
orion
nay
i
hardly
think
you
will
take
my
life
the
angel
michael
was
once
my
foe
he
had
a
little
the
best
of
our
strife
yet
he
never
could
deal
so
stark
a
blow
scene
a
chamber
in
the
nuns
apartments
of
the
convent
agatha
and
ursula
agatha
my
sire
in
my
childhood
pledged
my
hand
to
hugo
i
know
not
why
they
were
comrades
then
the
duke
command
in
the
wars
of
lombardy
i
thought
ere
my
summers
had
turned
sixteen
that
mine
was
a
grievous
case
save
once
for
an
hour
i
had
never
seen
my
intended
bridegroom
face
and
maidens
vows
of
their
own
will
plight
unknown
to
my
kinsfolk
all
my
love
was
vowed
to
a
danish
knight
a
guest
in
my
father
hall
his
foot
fell
lightest
in
merry
dance
his
shaft
never
missed
the
deer
he
could
fly
a
hawk
he
could
wield
a
lance
our
wildest
colt
he
could
steer
his
deep
voice
ringing
through
hall
or
glen
had
never
its
match
in
song
and
little
was
known
of
his
past
life
then
or
of
dorothea
wrong
i
loved
him
lady
abbess
i
know
that
my
love
was
foolish
now
i
was
but
a
child
five
years
ago
and
thoughtless
as
bird
on
bough
one
evening
hugo
the
norman
came
and
to
shorten
a
weary
tale
i
fled
that
night
let
me
bear
the
blame
with
harold
by
down
and
dale
he
had
mounted
me
on
a
dappled
steed
and
another
of
hue
he
rode
himself
and
away
at
speed
we
fled
through
mist
and
dew
of
miles
we
had
ridden
some
half
a
score
we
had
halted
beside
a
spring
when
the
breeze
to
our
ears
through
the
still
night
bore
a
distant
trample
and
ring
we
listen
one
breathing
space
and
caught
the
clatter
of
mounted
men
with
vigour
renewed
by
their
respite
short
our
horses
dash
through
the
glen
another
league
and
we
listen
in
vain
the
breeze
to
our
ears
came
mute
but
we
heard
them
again
on
the
spacious
plain
faint
tidings
of
hot
pursuit
in
the
misty
light
of
a
moon
half
hid
by
the
dark
or
fleecy
rack
our
shadows
over
the
moorland
slid
still
listening
and
looking
back
so
we
fled
with
a
cheering
word
to
say
at
times
as
we
hurried
on
from
sounds
that
at
intervals
died
away
and
at
intervals
came
anon
another
league
and
my
lips
grew
dumb
and
i
felt
my
spirit
quailing
for
closer
those
sounds
began
to
come
and
the
speed
of
my
horse
was
failing
the
grey
is
weary
and
lame
to
boot
quoth
harold
the
black
is
strong
and
their
steeds
are
blown
with
their
fierce
pursuit
what
wonder
our
start
was
long
now
lady
behind
me
mount
the
black
the
double
load
he
can
bear
we
are
safe
when
we
reach
the
forest
track
fresh
horses
and
friends
wait
there
then
i
sat
behind
him
and
held
his
waist
and
faster
we
seemed
to
go
by
moss
and
moor
but
for
all
our
haste
came
the
tramp
of
the
nearing
foe
a
dyke
through
the
mist
before
us
hover
and
quicken
by
voice
and
heel
the
black
overleap
it
stagger
recover
still
nearer
that
muffled
peal
and
louder
on
sward
the
grew
and
duller
though
not
less
nigh
on
deader
sand
and
a
dark
speck
drew
on
my
vision
suddenly
and
a
single
horseman
in
fleet
career
like
a
shadow
appear
to
glide
to
within
six
lances
lengths
of
our
rear
and
there
for
a
space
to
bide
quoth
harold
speak
has
the
moon
his
face
i
replied
not
so
yet
is
none
of
my
kinsfolk
then
he
in
the
saddle
and
scanned
the
foe
and
mutter
still
gazing
in
our
wake
is
he
now
i
will
not
fight
the
brother
again
for
the
sister
sake
while
i
can
escape
by
flight
who
harold
i
asked
but
he
never
spoke
by
the
cry
of
the
bittern
harsh
and
the
dull
discordant
croak
i
guess
that
we
near
the
marsh
and
the
moonbeam
flash
on
watery
sedge
as
it
broke
from
a
strip
of
cloud
ragged
and
jagged
about
the
edge
and
shaped
like
a
dead
man
shroud
and
flagg
and
falter
our
gallant
steed
the
weight
of
his
double
burden
as
we
splash
through
water
and
crash
through
reed
then
the
soil
began
to
harden
and
again
we
gain
or
we
seem
to
gain
with
our
foe
in
the
deep
morass
but
those
fleet
hoofs
thunder
and
gain
again
when
they
trampled
the
firmer
grass
and
i
cried
and
harold
again
look
back
and
bade
me
fasten
mine
eyes
on
the
forest
that
loom
like
a
patch
of
black
standing
out
from
the
faint
horizon
courage
sweetheart
we
are
saved
he
said
with
the
moorland
our
danger
ends
and
close
to
the
borders
of
yonder
glade
they
tarry
our
trusty
friends
where
the
mossy
uplands
rise
and
dip
on
the
edge
of
the
leafy
dell
with
a
lurch
like
the
lurch
of
a
sinking
ship
the
black
horse
toppled
and
fell
unharm
we
lit
on
the
velvet
sward
and
even
as
i
lit
i
lay
but
harold
uprose
unsheath
his
sword
and
toss
the
scabbard
away
and
spake
through
his
teeth
good
forbearance
at
last
is
spent
the
strife
that
thy
soul
hath
lusted
for
thou
shalt
have
to
thy
soul
content
while
he
spoke
our
pursuer
past
us
swept
ere
he
rein
his
proud
to
his
haunches
flung
then
to
the
earth
he
leapt
and
my
lover
voice
rang
loud
thrice
welcome
hugo
of
normandy
thou
hast
come
at
our
time
of
need
this
lady
will
thank
thee
and
so
will
i
for
the
loan
of
thy
sorrel
steed
and
never
a
word
lord
hugo
said
they
clos
the
wood
and
the
wold
and
the
white
steel
flickered
over
my
head
in
the
moonlight
calm
and
cold
the
feathery
grasses
crouching
low
with
face
bow
down
to
the
dust
i
heard
the
clash
of
each
warded
blow
the
click
of
each
parried
thrust
and
the
shuffling
feet
that
bruis
the
lawn
as
they
traversed
here
and
there
and
the
breath
through
the
clench
teeth
heavily
drawn
when
breath
there
was
none
to
spare
sharp
ringing
sword
play
dull
trampling
heel
short
pause
spent
force
to
regain
quick
muffled
footfall
harsh
grating
steel
sharp
ringing
rally
again
they
seem
long
hours
those
moments
fleet
as
i
counted
them
one
by
one
till
a
dead
weight
toppled
across
my
feet
and
i
knew
that
the
strife
was
done
when
i
looked
up
after
a
little
space
as
though
from
a
fearful
dream
the
moon
was
flinging
on
harold
face
a
white
and
a
gleam
and
i
felt
mine
ankles
moist
and
warm
with
the
blood
that
trickled
slow
from
a
spot
on
the
doublet
beneath
his
arm
from
a
ghastly
gash
on
his
brow
i
heard
the
tread
of
the
sorrel
hoof
as
he
bore
his
lord
away
they
passed
me
slowly
keeping
aloof
like
spectres
misty
and
grey
i
thought
lord
hugo
had
left
me
there
to
die
but
it
was
not
so
yet
then
for
death
i
had
little
care
my
soul
seem
numb
by
the
blow
a
faintness
follow
a
sickly
swoon
a
long
and
a
dreamless
sleep
and
i
woke
to
the
light
of
a
sultry
noon
in
my
father
castled
keep
and
thus
lady
abbess
it
came
to
pass
that
my
father
vow
his
vow
must
his
daughter
espouse
the
church
alas
is
she
better
or
wiser
now
for
some
are
feeble
and
others
strong
and
feeble
am
i
and
frail
mother
is
not
that
i
love
the
wrong
is
not
that
i
loathe
the
veil
but
with
heart
still
ready
to
go
astray
if
assail
by
a
fresh
temptation
i
could
sin
again
as
i
sinned
that
day
for
a
girl
infatuation
see
harold
the
dane
thou
is
dead
yet
i
weep
not
bitterly
as
i
fled
with
the
dane
so
i
might
have
fled
with
hugo
of
normandy
ursula
my
child
i
advise
no
hasty
vows
yet
i
pray
that
in
life
brief
span
thou
learn
that
our
church
is
a
fairer
spouse
than
fickle
and
erring
man
though
fenced
for
a
time
by
the
church
pale
when
that
time
expires
free
and
we
can
not
force
thee
to
take
the
veil
nay
we
scarce
can
counsel
thee
enter
the
abbot
hastily
basil
the
abbot
i
am
sorely
stricken
with
shame
and
grief
it
has
come
by
the
sign
a
summons
brief
from
the
outlaw
chief
count
rudolph
of
rothenstein
lady
abbess
ere
worse
things
come
to
pass
i
would
speak
with
thee
alone
alack
and
alas
for
by
the
rood
and
mass
i
fear
we
are
all
undone
scene

furnished
with
writing
materials
hugo
eric

on
one
side
on
the

we
have
granted
too
much
ye
ask
for
more
i
am
not
skill
in
your
clerkly
lore
i
scorn
your
logic
i
had
rather
die
than
live
like
hugo
of
normandy
i
am
a
norseman
frank
and
plain
ye
must
read
the
parchment
over
again
eric
jarl
osric
twice
we
have
read
this
scroll
osric
thou
hast
read
a
part
eric
i
have
read
the
whole
osric
aye
since
i
attached
my
signature
eric
before
and
since
rudolph
nay
of
this
be
sure
thou
hast
signed
in
fairness
now
let
it
rest
osric
i
had
rather
have
sign
upon
hugo
crest
he
has
argued
the
question
mouth
to
mouth
with
the
wordy
lore
of
the
subtle
south
let
him
or
any
one
of
his
band
come
and
argue
the
question
hand
to
hand
with
the
aid
of
my
i
will
show
that
a
score
of
words
are
not
worth
one
blow
thurston
to
the
devil
with
thee
and
thy
i
would
send
the
pair
of
ye
back
in
your
tracks
with
an
answer
that
even
to
thy
boorish
brain
would
scarce
need
repetition
again
osric
thou
saxon
slave
to
a
milksop
knight
i
will
give
thy
body
to
raven
and
kite
thurston
thou
liest
i
am
a
freeborn
man
and
thy
huge
carcase
in
cubit
and
span
like
the
giant
of
gath
saxon
steel
shall
furnish
the
kites
with
a
fatter
meal

by
odin
rudolph

thy
wrath
our
names

our
words
have
gone
forth
hugo
i
blame
thee

i
too
blame
myself
since
i
follow
a
knight
so
tame
thurston
goes
out

hound
he
said

i
pray
thee
good

be
pacified
osric
why
do
we
grant
the
terms
they
ask
to
crush
them
all
were
an
easy
task

that
thou
not
if
it
come
to
war
they
are
stronger
perhaps
than
we
bargain
for
eric
jarl
osric
thou
recall
thy
words
should
we
meet
again
osric
should
we
meet
with
swords
thou
too
recall
them
to
thy
sorrow
hugo
eric
we
dally
sir
count
scene
the
guest
chamber
of
the
convent
hugo
eric
and
orion
eric
hugo
their
siege
we
might
have
tried
this
place
would
be
easier
fortified
than
i
thought
at
first
it
is
now
too
late
they
have
cut
off
our
access
to
the
gate
hugo
i
have
weigh
the
chances
and
counted
the
cost
and
i
know
by
the
stars
that
all
is
lost
if
we
take
up
this
quarrel
eric
so
let
it
be
i
yield
to
one
who
is
wiser
than
me
aside
nevertheless
i
have
seen
the
day
when
the
stars
would
scarcely
have
bade
us
stay
enter
the
abbot
cyril
and
other
monks
hugo
lord
abbot
we
greet
thee
good
fathers
all
we
bring
you
greeting
orion
aside
and
comfort
small
abbot
god
benediction
on
you
my
sons
hugo
may
he
save
you
too
from
norsemen
and
huns
since
the
gates
are
beleaguer
and
walls
begirt
by
the
forces
of
osric
and
dagobert
is
a
heavy
price
that
the
knaves
demand
abbot
were
we
to
mortgage
the
church
land
we
never
could
raise
what
they
would
extort
orion
aside
the
price
is
too
long
and
the
notice
too
short
eric
and
you
know
the
stern
alternative
abbot
if
we
die
we
die
if
we
live
we
live
god
will
be
done
and
our
trust
is
sure
in
him
though
his
we
endure
two
messengers
rode
from
here
last
night
to
otto
they
carry
news
of
our
plight
on
my
swiftest
horses
i
saw
them
go
orion
aside
then
his
swiftest
horses
are
wondrous

we

unless
you
can
keep
these

for
a

at

the

is
too
far
away
to

a
hopeless

with

springing

sparkling
of

like

striven
to

move

heart
with
such
terror
is
riven

again

abbess
look
again

leaves
fall
by
wintry
gusts
scatter
as
fall

yield
they
go
down

thou
that

will
lift

crushes
like
crime
unforgiven
look
again
lady
abbess
look
again
ursula
close
under
the
gates
men
are
fighting
on
foot
where
the

is

that
through

and
skull
smiting
jarl
osric
falls
cloven
to
the
beard
and
hugo
the
hilt
firmly
grasping
his
heel
on
the
throat
of
his
foe
wrenches
back
i
can
hear
the
dull
rasping
the
steel
through
the
bone
grating
low
and
the
raven
rocks
thurston
has
landed
two
strokes
well
directed
and
hard
on
the
standard
pole
wielding
a
blade
crimson
up
to
the
guard
like
the
mast
cut
in
two
by
the
lightning
the
black
banner
topples
and
falls
bewildering

clears
a
wide
space
next
the
walls

to
agatha

sister
agatha
does
the
sinner
unshriven
with
naught
beyond
this
life
to
gain
pray
for
mercy
on
earth
or
in
heaven
look
again
lady
abbess
look
again
ursula
the
gates
are
flung
open
and
straightway
by
ambrose
and
cyril
led
on
our
own
men
rush
out
through
the
gateway
one
charge
and
the
entrance
is
won
no
our
foes
block
the
gate
and
endeavour
to
force
their
way
in
oath
and
yell
shout
and
wax
wilder
than
ever
those
children
of
odin
fight
well
and
my
ears
are
confused
by
the
crashing
the
jarring
the
discord
the
din
and
mine
eyes
are
perplex
by
the
flashing
of
fierce
lights
that
ceaselessly
spin
so
when
thunder
to
thunder
is
calling
quick
flash
follows
flash
in
the
shade
so
leaping
and
flashing
and
falling
blade
flashes
and
follows
on
blade
while
the
sward
newly
plough
freshly
painted
grows
purple
with
blood
of
the
slain
and
slippery
has
agatha
fainted
agatha
not
so
lady
abbess
look
again
ursula
no
more
from
the
window
in
the
old
years
i
have
look
upon
strife
now
i
go
to
the
to
rally
our
soldiers
as
i
may
face
to
face
with
the
foe

near
a
small
fire
enter
eustace
eustace
we
have
come
through
this
skirmish
with
hardly
a
scratch
thurston
and
without
us
i
fancy
they
have
a
full
batch
of
sick
men
to
look
to
those
robbers
will
soon
put
our
soundest
on
terms
with
our
worst
nathless
i
have
bartered
with
never
a
frown
ten
years
for
those
seconds
when
osric
went
down
where
ethelwolf
eustace
dying
thurston
and
reginald
eustace
dead
and
ralph
is
disabled

rudolph

tyrrel
nor
brian

ever
see

thurston
that
cyril
the
monk
is
a
very
respectable
fighter
eustace
not
bad
for
a
monk
yet
our
loss
had
been
lighter
had
he
and
his
fellows
thrown
open
the
gate
a
little
more
quickly
and
now
spite
of
fate
with
thirty
picked
soldiers
their
siege

might
weather
but
the
abbess
is
worth
all

i
heard
him

lie
on
his
shelf
ursula
alas

dead
as

what
then
we
too
one
and
all
die
to
fatten
these
ravenous
carrion
birds
i
knelt
down
by
hugo

heard
his
last
words
how
heavy
the
night
hangs
how
wild
the
waves
dash
say
a
mass
for
my
soul
and
give

ursula
nay

thrust
of
a
