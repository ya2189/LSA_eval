take
since
you
bade
it
should
bear
these
of
the
seed
of
your
sowing
blossom
or
berry
or
weed
sweet
though
they
be
not
or
fair
that
the
dew
of
your
word
kept
growing
sweet
at
least
was
the
seed
men
bring
you
of
tears
and
sorrow
the
kiss
that
assuages
and
slaves
the
of
wrongs
and
time
the
thanksgiving
of
years
and
years
the
thanksgiving
of
ages
i
bring
you
my
handful
of
songs
if
a
perfume
be
left
if
a
bloom
let
it
live
till
italia
be
risen
to
be
strewn
in
the
dust
of
her
car
when
her
voice
shall
awake
from

tomb
england
and
france
from
her
prison
sisters
a
star
by
a
star
i
bring
you
the
sword
of
a
song
the
sword
of
my
desire
feeble
but
laid
at
your
feet
that
which
was
weak
shall
be
strong
that
which
was
cold
shall
take
fire
that
which
was
bitter
be
sweet
it
was
wrought
not
with
hands
to
smite
nor
hewn
after
fashion
nor
tempered
on
anvil
of
steel
but
with
visions
and
dreams
of
the
night
but
with
hope
and
the
patience
of
passion
and
the
signet
of
love
for
a
seal
be
it
witness
till
one
more
strong
till
a
loftier
lyre
till
a
rarer
lute
praise
her
better
than
i
be
it
witness
before
you
my
song
that
i
knew
her
the
who
shall
cry
the
republican
cry
yea
even
she
as
at
first
yea
she
alone
and
none
other
shall
cast
down
shall
build
up

between
the
green

and
the
red
youth
sat
and
sang
by
time
and
shed
from
eyes
and
tresses
flowers
and
tears
from
heart
and
spirit
hopes
and
fears
upon
the
hollow
stream
whose
bed
is
channelled
by
the
foamless
years
and
with
the
white
the
head
mixed
running
locks
and
in
ears
dreams
hung
singing
and
truth
was
half
not
harsh
in
the
ears
of
youth
between
the
bud
and
the
blown
flower
youth
talked
with
joy
and
grief
an
hour
with
footless
joy
and
wingless
grief
and
faith
and
disbelief
who
share
the
seasons
to
devour
and
long
ere
these
made
up
their
sheaf
felt
the
winds
round
him
shake
and
shower
the
and
the
leaf
delight
whose
germ
grew
never
grain
and
passion
dyed
in
its
own
pain
then
he
stood
up
and
trod
to
dust
fear
and
desire
mistrust
and
trust
and
dreams
of
bitter
sleep
and
sweet
and
bound
for
sandals
on
his
feet
knowledge
and
patience
of
what
must
and
what
things
may
be
in
the
heat
and
cold
of
years
that
rot
and
rust
and
alter
and
his
meat
was
freedom
and
his
staff
was
wrought
of
strength
and
his
cloak
woven
of
thought
for
what
has
he
whose
will
sees
clear
to
do
with
doubt
and
faith
and
fear
swift
hopes
and
slow
despondencies
his
heart
is
equal
with
the
and
with
the
and
his
ear
is
level
to
the
speech
of
these
and
his
soul
communes
and
takes
cheer
with
the
actual
equalities
air
light
and
night
hills
winds
and
streams
and
seeks
not
strength
from
strengthless
dreams
his
soul
is
even
with
the
sun
whose
spirit
and
whose
eye
are
one
who
seeks
not
stars
by
day
nor
light
and
heavy
heat
of
day
by
night
him
can
no
god
cast
down
whom
none
can
lift
in
hope
beyond
the
height
of
fate
and
nature
and
things
done
by
the
calm
rule
of
might
and
right
that
bids
men
be
and
bear
and
do
and
die
beneath
blind
skies
or
blue
to
him
the
lights
of
even
and
morn
speak
no
vain
things
of
love
or
scorn
fancies
and
passions
miscreate
by
man
in
things
dispassionate
nor
holds
he
fellowship
forlorn
with
souls
that
pray
and
hope
and
hate
and
doubt
they
had
better
not
been
born
and
fain
would
lure
or
scare
off
fate
and
charm
their
doomsman
from
their
doom
and
make
fear
dig
its
own
false
tomb
he
builds
not
half
of
doubts
and
half
of
dreams
his
own
cenotaph
whence
hopes
and
fears
with
helpless
eyes
wrapt
loose
in
cerecloths
rise
and
dance
and
wring
their
hands
and
laugh
and
weep
thin
tears
and
sigh
light
sighs
and
without
living
lips
would
quaff
the
living
spring
in
man
that
lies
and
drain
his
soul
of
faith
and
strength
it
might
have
lived
on
a
length
he
hath
given
himself
and
hath
not
sold
to
god
for
heaven
or
man
for
gold
or
grief
for
comfort
that
it
gives
or
joy
for
restoratives
he
hath
given
himself
to
time
whose
fold
shuts
in
the
mortal
flock
that
lives
on
its
plain
heat
and
cold
and
the
equal
alternatives
earth
heaven
and
time
death
life
and
he
endure
while
they
shall
be
to
be
between
death
and
life
are
hours
to
flush
with
love
and
hide
in
flowers
what
profit
save
in
these
men
cry
see
between
soft
earth
and
sky
what
only
good
things
here
are
ours
they
say
better
wouldst
thou
try
what
sweeter
sing
of
or
what
powers
serve
that
will
give
thee
ere
thou
die
more
joy
to
sing
and
be
less
sad
more
heart
to
play
and
grow
more
glad
play
then
and
sing
we
too
have
played
we
likewise
in
that
subtle
shade
we
too
have
twisted
through
our
hair
such
tendrils
as
the
wild
loves
wear
and
heard
what
mirth
the
mænads
made
till
the
wind
blew
our
garlands
bare
and
left
their
roses
disarrayed
and
smote
the
summer
with
strange
air
and
disengirdled
and
discrowned
the
limbs
and
locks
that
bound
we
too
have
tracked
by
trees
the
tempest
of
the
thyiades
scare
the
loud
night
on
hills
that
hid
the
of
the
bassarid
heard
their
iron
cadences
fright
the
wolf
hungering
from
the
kid
outroar
the
seas
outchide
the
if
it
chid
and
hush
the
ravines
with
thunders
of
their
tambourines
but
the
fierce
flute
whose
notes
acclaim
dim
goddesses
of
fiery
fame
cymbal
and
clamorous
kettledrum
timbrels
and
tabrets
all
are
dumb
that
turned
the
high
chill
air
to
flame
the
singing
tongues
of
fire
are
numb
that
called
on
cotys
by
her
name
edonian
till
they
felt
her
come
and
maddened
and
her
mystic
face
lightened
along
the
streams
of
thrace
for
pleasure
slumberless
and
pale
and
passion
with
rejected
veil
pass
and
the
throng
of
hours
that
follow
them
with
song
till
their
feet
flag
and
voices
fail
and
lips
that
were
so
loud
so
long
learn
silence
or
a
wearier
wail
so
keen
is
change
and
time
so
strong
to
weave
the
robes
of
life
and
rend
and
weave
again
till
life
have
end
but
weak
is
change
but
strengthless
time
to
take
the
light
from
heaven
or
climb
the
hills
of
heaven
with
wasting
feet
songs
they
can
stop
that
earth
found
meet
but
the
stars
keep
their
ageless
rhyme
flowers
they
can
slay
that
spring
thought
sweet
but
the
stars
keep
their
spring
sublime
passions
and
pleasures
can
defeat
actions
and
agonies
control
and
life
and
death
but
not
the
soul
because
soul
is
god
still
what
wind
soever
waft
his
will
across
the
waves
of
day
and
night
to
port
or
shipwreck
left
or
right
by
shores
and
shoals
of
good
and
ill
and
still
its
flame
at
mainmast
height
through
the
rent
air
that
fill
sustains
the
indomitable
light
whence
only
man
hath
strength
to
steer
or
helm
to
handle
without
fear
save
his
own
light
overhead
none
leads
him
and
none
ever
led
across
hidden
past
youth
where
shoreward
shallows
are
through
age
that
drives
on
toward
the
red
vast
void
of
sunset
hailed
from
far
to
the
equal
waters
of
the
dead
save
his
own
soul
he
hath
no
star
and
sinks
except
his
own
soul
guide
helmless
in
middle
turn
of
tide
no
blast
of
air
or
fire
of
sun
puts
out
the
light
whereby
we
run
with
girded
loins
our
lamplit
race
and
each
from
each
takes
heart
of
grace
and
spirit
till
his
turn
be
done
and
light
of
face
from
each
face
in
whom
the
light
of
trust
is
one
since
only
souls
that
keep
their
place
by
their
own
light
and
watch
things
roll
and
stand
have
light
for
any
soul
a
little
time
we
gain
from
time
to
set
our
seasons
in
some
chime
for
harsh
or
sweet
or
loud
or
low
with
seasons
played
out
long
ago
and
souls
that
in
their
time
and
prime
took
part
with
summer
or
with
snow
lived
abject
lives
out
or
sublime
and
had
their
chance
of
seed
to
sow
for
service
or
disservice
done
to
those
days
daed
and
this
their
son
a
little
time
that
we
may
fill
or
with
such
good
works
or
such
ill
as
loose
the
bonds
or
make
them
strong
wherein
all
manhood
suffers
wrong
by
river
and
rill
there
are
who
rest
not
who
think
long
till
they
discern
as
from
a
hill
at
the
hour
of
morning
song
known
of
souls
only
and
those
souls
free
the
sacred
spaces
of
the
sea
the
eve
of
revolution
the
trumpets
of
the
four
winds
of
the
world
from
the
ends
of
the
earth
blow
battle
the
night
heaves
with
breasts
palpitating
and
wings
refurled
with
passion
of
couched
limbs
as
one
who
grieves
sleeping
and
in
her
sleep
she
sees
uncurled
dreams
such
as
sickness
weaves
down
the
wild
wind
of
vision
caught
and
whirled
dead
leaves
of
sleep
thicker
than
autumn
leaves
shadows
of
things
flights
of
dim
tribes
of
kings
the
reaping
men
that
reap
men
for
their
sheaves
and
without
grain
to
yield
their
thronged
thick
with
men
pursuing
and
fugitives
dead
foliage
of
the
tree
of
sleep
leaves
and
golden
blown
from
deep
to
deep
i
hear
the
midnight
on
the
mountains
cry
with
many
tongues
of
thunders
and
i
hear
sound
and
resound
the
hollow
shield
of
sky
with
winds
that
charge
and
cheer
and
through
the
roar
of
the
hours
that
fighting
fly
through
flight
and
fight
and
all
the
fluctuant
fear
a
sound
sublimer
than
the
heavens
are
high
a
voice
more
instant
than
the
winds
are
clear
say
to
my
spirit
thy
trumpet
too
and
make
a
rallying
music
in
the
void
ear
till
the
storm
lose
its
track
and
all
the
night
go
back
till
as
through
sleep
false
life
knows
true
life
near
thou
know
the
morning
through
the
night
and
through
the
thunder
silence
and
through
darkness
i
set
the
trumpet
to
my
lips
and
blow
the
height
of
night
is
shaken
the
skies
break
the
winds
and
stars
and
waters
come
and
go
by
fits
of
breath
and
light
and
sound
that
wake
as
out
of
sleep
and
perish
as
the
show
built
up
of
sleep
when
all
her
strengths
forsake
the
spirit
the
depths
glow
the
heights
flash
and
the
roots
and
summits
shake
of
earth
in
all
her
mountains
and
the
inner
foamless
fountains
and
wellsprings
of
her
forces
quake
yea
the
whole
air
of
life
is
set
on
fire
of
strife
till
change
unmake
things
made
and
love
remake
reason
and
love
whose
names
are
one
seeing
reason
is
the
sunlight
shed
from
love
the
sun
the
night
is
broken
eastward
is
it
day
or
but
the
watchfires
trembling
here
and
there
like
hopes
on
devastated
way
in
moonless
wastes
of
air
o
mother
great
and
grey
o
multitudinous
bosom
and
breasts
that
bare
our
generations
whereat
lay
the
weanling
peoples
and
the
tribes
that
were
whose
mouths
long
dead
those
ninefold
nipples
fed
dim
face
with
deathless
eyes
and
withered
hair
fostress
of
obscure
lands
whose
multiplying
hands
wove
the
web
with
divers
races

cast
it
on

waters
of
the
centuries

sawest
their
westering
waters
sweep
with
all
the
ships
and
spoils
of

all
the
fears

of
life

keep
thy
vesture

of
ages

usward
thine
impenetrable
sleep
and
thy
veiled
head
oldest
tributary
we
know
not
if
it
speak
or
smile
or

but
where
for
us
began
the
first
live
light
of
man
and
fire
of
deeds
to
burn
and
leap
the
first
war
fair
as
peace
to

greece
and
the
first
freedom
moved
upon
the
deep
breath
upon
the
face
of
time
moving
a
present
spirit
seen
of
men
sublime
there
where
our
east
looks
always
to
thy
west
our
mornings

greece
to
thee
these
lights

the
of
that
sea
the
grass
men
tread
upon
is
very
marathon

leaves
are
of
that

the
land
thick
with
only
such
graves
as
were
ashamed
to
look
upon
the
sky
ye
dead
whose
name
outfaces
and
outbraves
death
is
the
seed
of
such
as
you
gone
by
sea
have
thy
ports
not
heard
some
marathonian
word
rise
up
to
landward
and
to
godward
fly
no
thunder
that
the
skies
sent
not
upon
us
rise
with
fire
and
earthquake
and
a
cleaving
cry
nay
light
is
here
and
shall
be
light
though
all
the
face
of
the
hour
be
overborne
with
night
i
set
the
trumpet
to
my
lips
and
blow
the
night
is
broken
northward
the
pale
plains
and
footless
fields
of
snow
feel
through
their
creviced
lips
and
iron
veins
such
quick
breath
labour
and
such
clean
blood
flow
as
spring
feels
in
her
pains
when
dying
may
bears
june
too
young
to
know
the
fruit
that
waxes
from
the
flower
that
wanes
strange
tyrannies
and
vast
tribes
to
their
past
lands
that
are
loud
all
through
their
length
with
chains
wastes
where
the
wings
break
displumed
by
daylong
ache
and
anguish
of
blind
snows
and
rains
and
ice
that
seals
the
white
lips
whose
monstrous
weights
crush
flat
the
sides
of
shrieking
ships
horrible
sights
and
sounds
of
the
unreached
pole
and
shrill
fierce
climes
of
inconsolable
air
shining
below
the
beamless
aureole
that
hangs
about
the
hurtling
hair
a
lamp
sublime
and
sole
dawn
of
the
dayless
heaven
where
suns
despair
earth
skies
and
waters
smitten
into
soul
feel
the
hard
veil
that
iron
centuries
wear
rent
as
with
hands
in
sunder
such
hands
as
make
the
thunder
and
clothe
with
form
all
substance
and
strip
bare
shapes
shadows
sounds
and
lights
of

how

his

they
give
thee

the

ah
child

it
is
long
moonbeam

starbeam
and
song
leave
it
dumb
now
and
dark
yet
i
perceive
on

height
eastward
not

very
far
a
song
too
loud
for
the

a
light
too
strong
for

what
of
the
night
long
has
it
lulled
me
with
dreams
now
at
midwatch
as
it
seems
light
is
brought
back
to
mine

and
the
mastery
of
old
and
the

lives
in

steadies
my
limbs
as
they

strengthens

but
ungrown
there
is
one
who
shall
surely
requite
all
that
endure
or
that
err
she
can
answer
alone
ask
not
of
me
but
of
her
liberty
what
of
the
night
i
feel
not
the
red
rains
fall
hear
not
the
tempest
at
all
nor
thunder
in
heaven
any
more
all
the
distance
is
white
with
the
soundless
feet
of
the
sun
night
with
the
woes
that
it
wore
night
is
over
and
done
super
flumina
babylonis
by
the
waters
of
babylon
we
sat
down
and
wept
remembering
thee
that
for
ages
of
agony
hast
endured
and
slept
and
wouldst
not
see
by
the
waters
of
babylon
we
stood
up
and
sang
considering
thee
that
a
blast
of
deliverance
in
the
darkness
rang
to
set
thee
free
and
with
trumpets
and
thunderings
and
with
morning
song
came
up
the
light
and
thy
spirit
uplifted
thee
to
forget
thy
wrong
as
day
doth
night
and
thy
sons
were
dejected
not
any
more
as
then
when
thou
wast
shamed
when
thy
lovers
went
heavily
without
heart
as
men
whose
life
was
maimed
in
the
desolate
distances
with
a
great
desire
for
thy
sake
with
our
hearts
going
back
to
thee
they
were
filled
with
fire
were
nigh
to
break
it
was
said
to
us
ye
are
great
of
heart
but
ye
shall
bend
ye
are
bondmen
and
bondwomen
to
be
scourged
and
smart
to
toil
and
and
with
harrows
men
harrowed
us
and
subdued
with
spears
and
crushed
with
shame
and
the
summer
and
winter
was
and
the
length
of
years
and
no
change
came
by
the
rivers
of
italy
by
the
sacred
streams
by
town
by
tower
there
was
feasting
with
revelling
there
was
sleep
with
dreams
until
thine
hour
and
they
slept
and
they
rioted
on
their
beds
with
mouths
on
flame
and
with
and
with
heads
and
robes
of
shame
and
they
knew
not
their
forefathers
nor
the
hills
and
streams
and
words
of
power
nor
the
gods
that
were
good
to
them
but
with
songs
and
dreams
filled
up
their
hour
by
the
rivers
of
italy
by
the
dry
beds
when
thy
time
came
there
was
casting
of
crowns
from
them
from
their
young
heads
the
crowns
of
shame
by
the
horn
of
eridanus
by
the
tiber
mouth
as
thy
day
rose
they
arose
up
and
girded
them
to
the
north
and
south
by
seas
by
snows
as
a
water
in
january
the
frost
confines
thy
kings
bound
thee
as
a
water
in
april
is
in
the
vines
thy
sons
made
free
and
thy
lovers
that
looked
for
thee
and
that
mourned
from
far
for
thy
sake
dead
we
rejoiced
in
the
light
of
thee
in
the
signal
star
above
thine
head
in
thy
grief
had
we
followed
thee
in
thy
passion
loved
loved
in
thy
loss
in
thy
shame
we
stood
fast
to
thee
with
thy
pangs
were
moved
clung
to
thy
cross
by
the
hillside
of
calvary
we
beheld
thy
blood
thy
bloodred
tears
as
a
in
bitterness
an
unebbing
flood
years
upon
years
and
the
north
was
gethsemane
without
leaf
or
bloom
a
garden
sealed
and
the
south
was
aceldama
for
a
sanguine
fume
hid
all
the
field
by
the
stone
of
the
sepulchre
we
returned
to
weep
from
far
from
prison
and
the
guards
by
it
keeping
it
we
beheld
asleep
but
thou
wast
risen
and
an
similitude
by
the
unsealed
grave
and
by
the
stone
and
the
voice
was
angelical
to
whose
words
god
gave
strength
like
his
own
the
graveclothes
of
italy
that
are
folded
up
in
the
gloom
and
the
guards
as
men
wrought
upon
with
a
charmèd
cup
by
the
open
tomb
her
body
most
beautiful
and
her
shining
head
these
are
not
here
for
your
mother
for
italy
is
not
surely
dead
have
ye
no
fear
of
old
time
she
spake
to
you
and
you
hardly
heard
hardly
took
heed
so
now
also
she
saith
to
you
yet
another
word
who
is
risen
indeed
my
saying
she
saith
to
you
in
your
ears
she
saith
who
hear
these
things
put
no
trust
in
royalties
nor
in
great
breath
nor
words
of
kings
the
life
of
them
vanishes
and
is
no
more
seen
nor
no
more
known
nor
shall
any
remember
him
if
a
crown
hath
been
or
where
a
throne
each
man
his
handiwork
unto
each
his
crown
the
just
fate
gives
whoso
takes
the
life
on
him
and
his
own
lays
down
he
dying
so
lives
bears
the
whole
heaviness
of
the
wronged
weight
and
puts
it
by
it
is
well
with
him
suffering
though
he
face
fate
how
should
he
die
death
has
no
part
in
him
any
more
no
power
upon
his
head
he
has
bought
his
eternity
with
a
little
hour
and
is
not
dead
an
hour
if
ye
look
for
him
he
is
no
more
found
for
one
space
then
ye
lift
up
your
eyes
to
him
and
behold
him
crowned
a
deathless
face
the
mountains
of
memory
by
the
wellsprings
in
all
eyes
where
the
light
of
the
life
of
him
is
on
all
past
things
death
only
dies
the
light
that
was
quenched
for
us
nor
the
deeds
that
were
nor
the
ancient
days
nor
the
sorrows
not
sorrowful
nor
the
face
most
fair
of
perfect
so
the
angel
of
resurrection
said
so
yet
he
saith
so
the
son
of
her
suffering
that
from
breasts
nigh
dead
drew
life
not
death
that
the
pavement
of
golgotha
should
be
white
as
snow
not
red
but
white
that
the
waters
of
babylon
should
no
longer
flow
and
men
see
light
the
halt
before
rome
september
is
it
so
that
the
sword
is
broken
our
sword
that
was
halfway
drawn
is
it
so
that
the
light
was
a
spark
that
the
bird
we
hailed
as
the
lark
sang
in
her
sleep
in
the
dark
and
the
song
we
took
for
a
token
bore
false
witness
of
dawn
spread
in
the
sight
of
the
lion
surely
we
said
is
the
net
spread
but
in
vain
and
the
snare
vain
for
the
light
is
aware
and
the
common
the
chainless
air
of
his
coming
whom
all
we
cry
on
surely
in
vain
is
it
set
surely
the
day
is
on
our
side
and
heaven
and
the
sacred
sun
surely
the
stars
and
the
bright
immemorial
inscrutable
night
yea
the
darkness
because
of
our
light
is
no
darkness
but
blooms
as
a
when
the
winter
is
over
and
done
blooms
underfoot
with
young
grasses
green
and
with
leaves
overhead
windflowers
white
and
the
low
blossoms
of
snow
and
or
ever
the
may
winds
blow
and
or
ever
the
march
wind
passes
flames
with
anemones
red
we
are
here
in
the
we
that
have
watched
out
the
snow
surely
the
fruitfuller
showers
the
splendider
sunbeams
are
ours
shall
winter
return
on
the
flowers
and
the
frost
after
april
harden
and
the
fountains
in
may
not
flow
we
have
in
our
hands
the
shining
and
the
fire
in
our
hearts
of
a
star
who
are
we
that
our
tongues
should
palter
hearts
bow
down
hands
falter
who
are
clothed
as
with
flame
from
the
altar
that
the
kings
of
the
earth
repining
far
off
watch
from
afar
woe
is
ours
if
we
doubt
or
dissemble
woe
if
our
hearts
not
abide
are
our
chiefs
not
among
us
we
said
great
chiefs
living
and
dead
to
lead
us
glad
to
be
led
for
whose
sake
if
a
man
of
us
tremble
he
shall
not
be
on
our
side
what
matter
if
these
lands
tarry
that
tarried
we
said
not
of
old
france
made
drunken
by
fate
england
that
bore
up
the
weight
once
of
freedom
a
freight
holy
but
heavy
to
carry
for
hands
overflowing
with
gold
though
this
be
lame
and
the
other
fleet
but
blind
from
the
sun
and
the
race
be
no
more
to
these
alas
nor
the
palm
to
seize
who
are
weary
and
hungry
of
ease
yet
o
freedom
we
said
o
our
mother
is
there
not
left
to
thee
one
is
there
not
left
of
thy
daughters
is
there
not
one
to
thine
hand
fairer
than
these
and
of
fame
higher
from
of
old
by
her
name
washed
in
her
tears
and
in
flame
bathed
as
in
baptism
of
waters
unto
all
men
a
chosen
land
her
hope
in
her
heart
was
broken
fire
was
upon
her
and
clomb
hiding
her
high
as
her
head
and
the
world
went
past
her
and
said
we
heard
it
say
she
was
dead
and
now
behold
she
bath
spoken
she
that
was
dead
saying
o
mother
of
all
nations
thou
knowest
if
the
deaf
world
heard
heard
not
now
to
her
lowest
depths
where
the
strong
blood
slowest
beats
at
her
bosom
thou
knowest
in
her
toils
in
her
dim
tribulations
rejoiced
not
hearing
the
word
the
sorrowful
bound
unto
sorrow
the
people
and
all
that
of
old
were
discomforted
and
men
that
famish
for
bread
and
men
that
mourn
for
their
dead
she
bade
them
be
glad
on
the
morrow
who
endured
in
the
day
of
her
thrall
the
blind
and
the
people
in
prison
souls
without
hope
without
home
how
glad
were
they
all
that
heard
when
the
winged
white
flame
of
the
word
passed
over
dust
and
stirred
death
for
italia
was
risen
and
risen
her
light
upon
rome
the
light
of
her
sword
in
the
gateway
shone
an
unquenchable
flame
bloodless
a
sword
to
release
a
light
from
the
eyes
of
peace
to
bid
grief
utterly
cease
and
the
wrong
of
the
old
world
straightway
pass
from
the
face
of
her
fame
hers
whom
we
turn
to
and
cry
on
italy
mother
of
men
from
the
light
of
the
face
of
her
glory
at
the
sound
of
the
storm
of
her
story
that
the
sanguine
shadows
and
hoary
should
flee
from
the
foot
of
the
lion
forth
of
his
den
as
the
answering
of
thunder
to
thunder
is
the
sound
of
her
past
as
the
calling
of
sea
unto
sea
is
the
noise
of
her
years
yet
to
be
for
this
ye
knew
not
is
she
whose
bonds
are
broken
in
sunder
this
is
she
at
the
last
so
spake
we
aloud
full
of
our
will
and
behold
the
speech
that
was
halfway
spoken
breaks
as
a
pledge
that
is
broken
as
a
pledge
leaving
in
token
grief
only
for
high
hopes
blinded
new
grief
grafted
on
old
we
halt
by
the
walls
of
the
city
within
sound
of
the
clash
of
her
chain
hearing
we
know
that
in
there
the
lioness
chafes
in
her
lair
shakes
the
storm
of
her
hair
struggles
in
hands
without
pity
roars
to
the
lion
in
vain
whose
hand
is
stretched
forth
upon
her
whose
curb
is
white
with
her
foam
clothed
with
the
cloud
of
his
deeds
swathed
in
the
shroud
of
his
creeds
who
is
this
that
has
trapped
her
and
leads
who
turns
to
despair
and
dishonour
her
name
her
name
that
was
rome
over
fields
without
harvest
or
culture
over
hordes
without
honour
or
love
over
nations
that
groan
with
their
kings
as
an
imminent
pestilence
flings
swift
death
from
her
shadowing
wings
so
he
who
hath
claws
as
a
vulture
plumage
and
beak
as
a
dove
he
saith
am
pilot
and
haven
light
and
redemption
i
am
unto
souls
overlaboured
he
saith
and
to
all
men
the
blast
of
his
breath
is
a
savour
of
death
unto
death
and
the
dove
of
his
worship
a
raven
and
a
the
lamb
he
calls
his
sheep
as
a
shepherd
calls
from
the
wilderness
home
unto
me
and
be
fed
to
feed
them
with
ashes
for
bread
and
grass
from
the
graves
of
the
dead
leaps
on
the
fold
as
a
leopard
slays
and
says
am
rome
rome
having
rent
her
in
sunder
with
the
clasp
of
an
adder
he
clasps
swift
to
shed
blood
are
his
feet
and
his
lips
that
have
man
for
their
meat
smoother
than
oil
and
more
sweet
than
honey
but
hidden
thereunder
festers
the
poison
of
asps
as
swords
are
his
tender
mercies
his
kisses
as
mortal
stings
under
his
hallowing
hands
life
dies
down
in
all
lands
kings
pray
to
him
prone
where
he
stands
and
his
blessings
as
other
curses
disanoint
where
they
consecrate
kings
with
an
oil
of
unclean
consecration
with
effusion
of
blood
and
of

with

of

of

how
shall
the
spirit
be
loyal
to
the
shell
of
a
spiritless
thing
erred
once
in
only
a
word
the
sweet
great
song
that
we
heard
poured
upon

calling
a

no

melted
all
hope
out
of

dropped
all

from
the

in
that
weary
funereal
season
in
that
time
the
weight
of
a
king

the
worth
with
anger
and
sorrowful
mirth
we
weighed
in
the
balance
of

his

heavy
his

fluttered

shoots
were
as
warmth

sweet
singing

was
blown
about
the
world
in
flame
and
souls
shot
up
out
of
reach
of
fear
or
lust
or
thwarting
that
thy
faith
over
souls
should
pass
as
burning
the
grey
grass
it
was
for
this
that
prayers
like
these
should
spend
themselves
about
thy
feet
and
with
hard
overlaboured
knees
kneeling
these
slaves
of
men
should
beat
bosoms
too
lean
to
suckle
sons
and
fruitless
as
their
orisons

was
for
this
that
men
should
make
thy

a

on

poor
made
poorer
for
thy

and
withered
out

thee
thy

the

buffets
on
thine
head
on
their
crowned
heads
confirm
the

thy
scourging
dyes
their
raiment
red
and
with
thy
bands
they
fasten
down
for
burial
in
the
field
the
nations
by
thy
stripes
unhealed
with
iron
for
thy
linen
bands
and
unclean
cloths
for
they
bind
the
hands
they
hide
the
feet
and
what
man
or
what
angel
known
shall
roll
back
the
sepulchral
stone
but
these
have
not
the
rich
grave
to
sleep
in
when
their
pain
is
done
these
were
not
fit
for
god
to
save
as
naked
is
the

in

living

when
dead
these
have
not

they

no

earth
is
not

that
they

on

these
tombless
crucified
no

to
weep
so
still
for
all

the

through

a

driven
faith
and
another
through
the

forged
in
the
fires
of
hell
and

fear
that
puts
out
the

of

and
the

soiled

scarred

pale
are
pierced
with
falsehood
for

and

against

push
their

full
of

for

on

the

deferred
what

the

part
thy

all
thy

are

and
all
the
nights
that
eat
thine
heart
and
that
one
seamless
coat
of
christ
the
freedom
of
the
natural
soul
they
cast
their
lots
for
to
keep
whole
no
fragment
of
it
save
the

they
leave
thee
for
a
crown
of
scorns
wherewith
to
mock
thy
naked
shame
and
forehead
bitten
through
with
thorns
and
marked
with
sanguine
sweat
and

the
stripes
of
eighteen
hundred
years
and
we
seek
yet
if
god
or
man
can
loosen
thee
as
lazarus
bid
thee
rise
up
republican
and
save
thyself
and
all
of
us
but
no
tongue
can
say
when
thou
shalt
take
our
sins
away
and
mouldering
now
and
hoar
with
moss
between
us
and
the
sunlight
swings
the
phantom
of
a
christless
cross
shadowing
the
sheltered

and
making
with
its
moving
shade
the
souls
of
harmless
men
afraid
it
creaks
and
rocks
to
left

right
consumed
of
rottenness
and
rust
of
the
worms
of
night
dead
as
their
spirits
who
put
trust
round
its

muttering
as

thou
in
the

that
breaks
thy

though
these

take
thy

thee

thou
not

for
these
are
they
whose

was
thine
evil

set
not
thine

unto

give
not
thy

up

of

let

this

the

thy
grace
in

nazarene
as
that
from
thy
live
lips
which
ran
for
sake
o
thou
son
of
man
the
tree
of
faith
ingraffed
by
priests
puts
its
foul
foliage
out
above
thee
and
round
it
feed
beasts
because
of
whom
we
dare
not
love
thee
though
hearts
reach
back
and

ache
we
can
not
praise
thee
for
their

o
hidden

whereover
the
years
have
woven
a
viewless
veil
if
thou
wast
verily
lover
what
did
thy
love
or
blood
avail
thy
blood
the
priests
make
poison
of
and
in
gold
shekels
coin
thy
love
so
when
our
souls
look
back
to
thee
they
sicken
seeing
against
thy
side
too
foul
to
speak
of
or
to
see
the
leprous
likeness
of
a
bride
whose
kissing
lips
through
his
lips
grown
leave
their
god
rotten
to
the
bone
when
we
would
see
thee
man
and
know
what
heart
thou
hadst
toward
men
indeed
lo
thy
altars
lo
the
lips
of
priests
that
pray
and
feed
while
their
own
worm
curls
and
licks
the
poison
of
the
crucifix
thou
let
children
come
to
thee
what
children
now
but
curses
come
what
manhood
in
that
god
can
be
who
sees
their
worship
and
is
dumb
no
soul
that
lived
loved
wrought
and
died
is
this
their
carrion
crucified
nay
if
their
god
and
thou
be
one
if
thou
and
this
thing
be
the
same
thou
shouldst
not
look
upon
the
sun
the
sun

haggard
at
thy

down

done
with

not

no

at
the

high
tide
of
the
night
at
the
turn
of
the
fluctuant
hours
when
the
waters
of
time
are
at
height
in
a
vision
arose
on
my
sight
the
kingdoms
of
earth
and
the
powers
in
a
dream
without
lightening
of
eyes
i
saw
them
children
of
earth
nations
and
races
arise
each
one
after
his
wise
signed
with
the
sign
of
his
birth
sound
was
none
of
their
feet
light
was
none
of
their
faces
in
their
lips
breath
was
not
or
heat
but
a
subtle
murmur
and
sweet
as
of
water
in
wan
waste
places
pale
as
from
passionate
years
years
unassuaged
of
desire
sang
they
soft
in
mine
ears
crowned
with
jewels
of
tears
girt
with
girdles
of
fire
a
slow
song
beaten
and
broken
as
it
were
from
the
dust
and
the
dead
as
of
spirits
athirst
unsloken
as
of
things
unspeakable
spoken
as
of
tears
unendurable
shed
in
the
manifold
sound
remote
in
the
molten
murmur
of
song
there
was
but
a
sharp
sole
note
alive
on
the
night
and
afloat
the
cry
of
the
wrong
as
the
sea
in
the
strait
the
sound
came
straitened
and
strange
a
noise
of
the
rending
of
graves
a
tidal
thunder
of
waves
the
music
of
death
and
of
change
have
waited
so
long
they
say
a
sound
of
the
god
for
a
breath
for
a
ripple
of
the
refluence
of
day
for
the
fresh
bright
wind
of
the
fray
for
the
light
of
the
sunrise
of
death
have
prayed
not
we
to
be
strong
to
fulfil
the
desire
of
our
eyes
they
have
watched
for
it
long
watched
and
the
night
did
them
wrong
yet
they
say
not
of
day
shall
it
rise
are
fearful
and
feeble
with
years
yet
they
doubt
not
of
day
if
it
be
yea
blinded
and
beaten
with
tears
yea
sick
with
foresight
of
fears
yet
a
little
and
hardly
they
see
pray
not
we
for
the
palm
for
the
fruit
ingraffed
of
the
fight
for
the
blossom
of
peace
and
the
balm
and
the
tender
triumph
and
calm
of
crownless
and
weaponless
right
pray
not
we
to
behold
the
latter
august
new
birth
the
young
purple
and
gold
and
divine
and
rerisen
as
of
old
the
freedom
on
earth
and
honour
and
fame
we
have
sought
after
none
of
these
things
the
light
of
a
life
like
flame
passing
the
storm
of
a
name
shaking
the
strongholds
of
kings
fashioned
of
fire
and
of
air
the
splendour
that
burns
on
his
head
who
was
chiefest
in
ages
that
were
whose
breath
blew
palaces
bare
whose
eye
shone
tyrannies
dead
these
things
in
your
day
ye
shall
see
o
our
sons
and
shall
hold
surely
but
we
in
the
grey
twilight
for
one
thing
we
pray
in
that
day
though
our
memories
be
cold
feel
on
our
brows
as
we
wait
an
air
of
the
morning
a
breath
from
the
springs
of
the
east
from
the
gate
whence
freedom
issues
and
fate
sorrow
and
triumph
and
death
a
land
whereon
time
hath
not
trod
where
the
spirit
is
bondless
and
bare
and
the
rein
breaks
and
the
rod
and
the
soul
of
a
man
which
is
god
he
adores
without
altar
or
prayer
alone
of
herself
and
her
right
she
takes
and
alone
gives
grace
and
the
colours
of
things
lose
light
and
the
forms
in
the
limitless
white
splendour
of
space
without
space
the
blossom
of
man
from
his
tomb
yearns
open
the
flower
that
survives
and
the
shadows
of
changes
consume
in
the
colourless
passionate
bloom
of
the
live
light
made
of
our
lives
each
life
given
is
a
leaf
of
the
manifold
multiform
flower

of
the
ecumenical
council
in
the
grey
beginning
of
years
in
the
twilight
of
things
that
began
the
word
of
the
earth
in
the
ears
of
the
world
was
it
god
was
it

the
word
of
the

to

her
sisters
the
note
of
her
song
the
sound
of
her
speech
in
the
ears
of
the
starry
and
sisterly
throng
was
it
praise
or
passion
or
prayer
was
it
love
or
devotion
or
dread
when
the
veils
of
the
shining
air
first
wrapt
her
jubilant
head
when
her
eyes
of
the
night
saw
yet
no
star
out
of
reach
when
her
maiden
mouth
was
alight
with
the
flame
of
musical
speech
when
her
virgin
feet
were
set
on
the
terrible
heavenly
way
and
her
virginal
lids
were
wet
with
the
dew
of
the
birth
of
the
day
eyes
that
had
looked
not
on
time
and
ears
that
had
heard
not
of
death
lips
that
had
learnt
not
the
rhyme
of
change
and
passionate
breath
the
rhythmic
anguish
of
growth
and
the
motion
of
mutable
things
of
love
that
longs
and
is
loth
and
hope
without
wings
passions
and
pains
without
number
and
life
that
runs
and
is
lame
from
slumber
again
to
slumber
the
same
race
set
for
the
same
where
the
runners
outwear
each
other
but
running
with
lampless
hands
no
man
takes
light
from
his
brother
till
blind
at
the
goal
he
stands
ah
did
they
know
did
they
dream
of
it
counting
the
cost
and
the
worth
the
ways
of
her
days
did
they
seem
then
good
to
the
earth
did
her
heart
rejoice
and
the
might
of
her
spirit
exult
in
her
then
child
yet
no
child
of
the
night
and
motherless
mother
of
men
was
it
love
brake
forth
a
bird
with
gold
on
his
wings
lovely
her
firstborn
passion
and
impulse
of
firstborn
things
was
love
that
nestling
indeed
that
under
the
plumes
of
the
night
was
hatched
and
hidden
as
seed
in
the
furrow
and
brought
forth
bright
was
it
love
lay
shut
in
the
shell
having
over
him
there
black
wings
that
impel
the
might
of
the
night
through
air
and
bursting
his
shell
as
a
bird
night
shook
through
her
vans
and
her
heart
as
a
water
was
stirred
and
its
heat
was
the
firstborn
for
the
waste
of
the
dead
void
air
took
form
of
a
world
at
birth
and
the
waters
and
firmaments
were
and
light
and
the
earth
the
beautiful
bird
unbegotten
that
night
brought
forth
without
pain
in
the
fathomless
years
forgotten
whereover
the
dead
gods
reign
was
it
love
life
godhead
or
fate
we
say
the
spirit
is
one
that
moved
on
the
dark
to
create
out
of
darkness
the
stars
and
the
sun
before
the
growth
was
the
grower
and
the
seed
ere
the
plant
was
sown
but
what
was
seed
of
the
sower
and
the
grain
of
him
whence
was
it
grown
foot
after
foot
ye
go
back
and
travail
and
make
yourselves
mad
blind
feet
that
feel
for
the
track
where
highway
is
none
to
be
had
therefore
the
god
that
ye
make
you
is
grievous
and
gives
not
aid
because
it
is
but
for
your
sake
that
the
god
of
your
making
is
made
thou
and
i
and
he
are
not
gods
made
men
for
a
span
but
god
if
a
god
there
be
is
the
substance
of
men
which
is
man
our
lives
are
as
pulses
or
pores
of
his
manifold
body
and
breath
as
waves
of
his
sea
on
the
shores
where
birth
is
the
beacon
of
death
we

the
multiform
features
of

whatsoever
we

recreate
him
of
whom
we
are
creatures
and
all
we
only
are
he
not
each
man
of
all
men
is
god
but
god
is
the
fruit
of
the
whole
indivisible
spirit
and
blood
indiscernible
body
from

not
but
is
the
glory
of
godhead
the
kingdom
of
time
the
mountainous
ages
made
hoary
with
snows
for
the
spirit
to
climb
a
god
with
the
world
inwound
whose
clay
to
his
footsole
clings
a
manifold
god
as
with
iron
of
adverse
things
a
soul
that
labours
and
lives
an
emotion
a
strenuous
breath
from
the
flame
that
its

mouth
gives
reillumed

refreshed
with
death
in
the
sea
whereof
centuries

the
live
god
plunges
and
swims
his
bed

in
all
graves
but
the
worm
hath
not
hold
on
his
limbs
night
puts
out
not
his
eyes
nor

sheds
change
on
his
head
with
such
fire
as
the
stars
of
the
skies
are
the
roots
of
his

fed
men
are
the
thoughts
passing
through
it
the

that
fulfil
it
with
blood
with

of

to
renew
it
as

the
plumes
that
feather
his

since
being
began
with
the
wind

thunder
of
things
things
are
cruel
and
blind
their
strength
detains
and
deforms
and
the
wearying
wings
of
the
mind
still
beat
up
the
stream
of
their
storms
still
as
one
swimming
up
stream
they
strike
out
blind
in
the
blast
in
thunders
of
vision
and
dream
and
lightnings
of

we
are
baffled
and
caught
in
the
current

upon
edges
of
shoals

in
the

sore

shut

out

what

what

folly

it

they

for
master
they
feel
not

from

while
man
makes

to
disaster
and
woos
desolation
with

made
himself
chains

his

plucked
out

constrains
him
his

only
denies
the

bow
to

whose

thou
that
wast
god
is
it
thou
thou
madest
man
in
the
garden
thou
temptedst
man
and
he
fell
thou
gavest
him
poison
and
pardon
for
blood
and
to
sell
thou
hast
sealed
thine
elect
to
salvation
fast
locked
with
faith
for
the
key

now
for
thyself
expiation
and
be
thine
atonement
for
thee
ah
thou
that
darkenest
thou
that
bringest
a
by
the
crimes
of
thine
hands
unforgiven
they
beseech
thee
to
hear
them
o
lord
by
the
balefires
of
ages
that
burn
for
thine
incense
by
creed
and
by
rood
by
the
famine
and
passion
that
yearn
and
that
hunger
to
find
of
thee
food
by
the
children
that
asked
at
thy
throne
of
the
priests
that
were
fat
with
thine
hire
for
bread
and
thou
gavest
a
stone
for
light
and
thou
madest
them
fire
by
the
kiss
of
thy
peace
like
a
kiss
that
leaves
the
soul
rotten
at
root
by
the
savours
of
gibbets
and
stakes
thou
hast
planted
to
bear
to
thee
fruit
by
torture

terror

treason
that

thee
weapons

thy
power
upon

made

malice
of
things
o
thou
that
hast
built
thee
a
shrine
of
the
madness
of
man
and
his
shame
and
hast
hung
in
the
midst
for
a
sign
of
his
worship
the
lamp
of
thy
name
that
hast
shown
him
for
heaven
in
a
vision
a
void
shadow
and
shell
and
hast
fed
thy
delight
and
derision
with
fire
of
belief
as
of
hell
that
hast
fleshed
on
the
souls
that
believe
thee
the
fang
of
the
fear
with
anguish
of
dreams
to
deceive
them
whose
faith
cries
out
in
thine
ear
by
the
face
of
the
spirit
confounded
before
thee
and
humbled
in
dust
by
the
dread
wherewith
life
was
astounded
and
shamed
out
of
sense
of
its
trust
by
the
scourges
of
doubt
and
repentance
that
fell
on
the
soul
at
thy
nod
thou
art
judged
o
judge

the
sentence
is
gone
forth
against
thee
o

thy

thy

with
bodies
was
fed
and
the
world
was
on
flame
with
his
fires
o
fools
he
was
god
and
is
dead
he
will
hear
not
again
the
strong
crying
of
earth
in
his
ears
as
before
and
the
fume
of
his
multitudes
dying
shall
flatter
his
nostrils
no
more
by
the
spirit
he
ruled
as
his

is
he
slain
who
was
mighty
to
slay

come
ears
hath
he

hears
not
and

he
sees
not

is
dumb
his
red
raiment
is
ripped
from
him
naked
his
staff
broken
down
and
the
signs
of
his
empire
are
stripped
from
him
shuddering
and
where
is
his
crown
and
in
vain
by
the
wellsprings
refrozen

god
of
thy

thy

he
none

left

nor
warmth
in
his
breath
till
his
corpse
be
cast
out
of
the
sun
will
ye
know
not
the
truth
of
his
death
surely
ye
say
he
is
strong
though
the
times
be
against
him
and
men
yet
a
little
ye
say
and
how
long
till
he
come
to
show
judgment
again
shall
god
then
die
as
the

die
who

rise
up
now

thyself
god
they

out
thine

thine
aspirants
to
heavenward
whose
faith
is
as

o
thou
the
lord
god
of
our
tyrants
they
call
thee
their

by
thy
name
that
in

burned
at
the
point
of
thy

thou
art
smitten
thou

thou
art
smitten
thy
death
is
upon
thee
o
lord
and
the
of
earth
as
thou
diest
resounds
through
the
wind
of
her
glory
to
man
in
the
highest
for
man
is
the
master
of
things
the
pilgrims
who
is
your
lady
of
love
o
ye
that
pass
singing
and
is
it
for
sorrow
of
that
which
was
that
ye
sing
sadly
or
dream
of
what
shall
be
for
gladly
at
once
and
sadly
it
seems
ye
sing
lady
of
love
by
you
is
unbeholden
for
hands
she
hath
none
nor
eyes
nor
lips
nor
golden
treasure
of
hair
nor
face
nor
form
but
we
that
love
we
know
her
more
fair
than
anything
she
a
queen
having
great
gifts
to
give
these
that
whoso
hath
seen
her
shall
not
live
except
he
serve
her
sorrowing
with
strange
pain
travail
and
bloodshedding
and
bitterer
tears
and
when
she
bids
die
he
shall
surely
die
and
he
shall
leave
all
things
under
the
sky
and
go
forth
naked
under
sun
and
rain
and
work
and
wait
and
watch
out
all
his
years
she
on
earth
no
place
of
habitation
to
age
calling
nation
answering
nation
cries
out
where
is
she
and
there
is
none
to
say
for
if
she
be
not
in
the
spirit
of
men
for
if
in
the
inward
soul
she
hath
no
place
in

they
cry
unto
her
seeking
her
face
in
vain
their
mouths
make
much
of
her
for
they
cry
with
vain
tongues
till
the
heart
lives
again
ye
that
follow
and
have
ye
no
repentance
for
on
your
brows
is
written
a
mortal
sentence
an
hieroglyph
of
sorrow
a
fiery
sign
that
in
your
lives
ye
shall
not
pause
or
rest
nor
have
the
sure
sweet
common
love
nor
keep
friends
and
safe
days
nor
joy
of
life
nor
sleep
have
we
not
who
have
one
thing
the
divine
face
and
clear
eyes
of
faith
and
fruitful
breast
ye
shall
die
before
your
thrones
be
won
and
the
changed
world
and
the
liberal
sun
shall
move
and
shine
without
us
and
we
lie
dead
but
if
she
too
move
on
earth
and
live
but
if
the
old
world
with
all
the
old
irons
rent
laugh
and
give
thanks
shall
we
be
not
content
nay
we
shall
rather
live
we
shall
not
die
life
being
so
little
and
death
so
good
to
give
these
men
shall
forget
but
we
shall
be
a
part
of
the
earth
and
the
ancient
sea
and
air
august
and
awful
fire
and
all
things
good
and
no
heart
shall
beat
but
somewhat
in
it
of
our
blood
once
shed
shall
quiver
and
quicken
as
now
in
us
the
dead
blood
of
men
slain
and
the
old
same
desire
plants
in
their
fiery
footprints
our
fresh
feet
ye
that
might
be
clothed
with
all
things
pleasant
ye
are
foolish
that
put
off
the
fair
soft
present
that
clothe
yourselves
with
the
cold
future
air
when
mother
and
father
and
tender
sister
and
brother
and
the
old
live
love
that
was
shall
be
as
ye
dust
and
no
fruit
of
loving
life
shall
be
shall
be
yet
who
is
more
than
all
these
were
than
sister
or
wife
or
father
unto
us
or
mother
this
worth
life
is
this
to
win
for
wages
lo
the
dead
mouths
of
the
awful
ages
the
venerable
in
the
past
that
is
their
prison
in
the
outer
darkness
in
the
unopening
grave
laugh
knowing
how
many
as
ye
now
say
have
said
how
many
and
all
are
fallen
are
fallen
and
dead
shall
ye
dead
rise
and
these
dead
have
not
risen
we
but
she
who
is
tender
and
swift
to
save
ye
not
weary
and
faint
not
by
the
way
seeing
night
by
night
devoured
of
day
by
day
seeing
hour
by
hour
consumed
in
sleepless
fire
sleepless
and
ye
too
when
shall
ye
too
sleep
are
weary
in
heart
and
head
in
hands
and
feet
and
surely
more
than
all
things
sleep
were
sweet
than
all
things
save
the
inexorable
desire
which
whoso
knoweth
shall
neither
faint
nor
weep
this
so
sweet
that
one
were
fain
to
follow
is
this
so
sure
where
all
hopes
are
hollow
even
this
your
dream
that
by
much
tribulation
ye
shall
make
whole
flawed
hearts
and
bowed
necks
straight
though
our
life
were
blind
our
death
were
fruitless
not
therefore
were
the
whole
high
hope
rootless
but
man
to
man
nation
would
turn
to
nation
and
the
old
life
live
and
the
old
great
word
be
great
on
then
and
pass
by
us
and
let
us
be
for
what
light
think
ye
after
life
to
see
and
if
the
world
fare
better
will
ye
know
and
if
man
triumph
who
shall
seek
you
and
say
of
light
is
this
for
one
span
that
all
men
born
are
mortal
but
not
man
and
we
men
bring
death

by
night
to
sow
that

may

all
feebler
footprint
of
pursuit
that
touched
the
highest
of
hope
and
went
up

a
heart
whereto
love
was
law
a
soul
reproachless
without
fear

flaw
a
shining
spirit
without
shadow
of
shame
a
memory
made
of
all
love

be
the

what
need
o
soul
to
sign
thee
with
thy
name
ii
all
woes
of
all
men
sat
upon
thy
soul
and
all
their
wrongs
were
heavy
on
thy
head
with
all
their
wounds
thy
heart
was
pierced
and
bled
and
in
thy
spirit
as
in
a
mourning
scroll
the
huge
sorrows
were
inscribed
by
roll
all
theirs
on

who
serve

faint
for

all
banished

dead
thy

and
for
the
whole
was
my
day
of
glory
didst
thou
say
when
by
the
scaffold
thou
hadst
hope
to
climb
for
thy
sake
they
brought
thee
respite
i
shall
not
die
then
i
have
missed
my
o

wherefore
now
these
eighteen
years
hast
thou
forgotten
me
from
whom
thy
life
began
thy
and
thy
and
thy
beauty
thy
might
of
hands
and
feet
thy
soul
made
strong
for
divinity
of
duty
and
service
which
was
sweet
through
the
red
sea
brimmed
with
blood
didst
thou
not
follow
me
as
one
that
walks
in
trance
was
the
storm
strong
to
break
or
the
sea
to
swallow
thee
when
thou
wast
free
and
france
i
am
freedom
god
and
man
o
france
that
plead
with
thee
how
long
now
shall
i
plead
was
i
not
with
thee
in
travail
and
in
need
with
thee
thy
sore
travail
and
need
thou
wast
fairest
and
first
of
my
daughters
fairest
and
foremost
thou
and
thy
breast
was
white
though
thy
hands
were
red
with
slaughters
thy
breast
a
now
o
foolish
virgin
and
fair
among
the
fallen
a
ruin
where
satyrs
dance
a
garden
wasted
for
beasts
to
crawl
and
brawl
in
what
hast
thou
done
with
france
where
is
she
who
bared
her
bosom
but
to
thunder
her
brow
to
storm
and
flame
and
before
her
face
was
the
red
sea
cloven
in
sunder
and
all
its
waves
made
tame
and
the
surf
wherein
the
rocks
were
shaking
she
saw
far
off
divide
at
the
blast
of
the
breath
of
the
battle
blown
and
breaking
and
weight
of
wind
and
tide
and
the
ravin
and
the
ruin
of
thronèd
nations
and
every
royal
race
and
the
kingdoms
and
kings
from
the
state
of
their
high
stations
that
fell
before
her
face
yea
great
was
the
fall
of
them
all
that
rose
against
her
from
the
heights
for
my
hands
were
fire
and
my
wings
as
walls
that
fenced
her
mine
eyes
as
not
as
guerdons
given
of
kings
the
gifts
i
brought
her
not
strengths
that
pass
away
but
my
heart
my
breath
of
life
o
france
o
daughter
i
gave
thee
in
that
day
yea
the
blood
of
a
very
god
i
gave
thee
breathed
in
thy
mouth
his
breath
was
my
word
as
a
having
no
more
strength
to
save
thee
from
this
worse
thing
than
death
didst
thou
dream
of
it
only
the
day
that
i
stood
nigh
thee
was
all
its
light
a
dream
when
that
iron
surf
roared
backwards
and
went
by
thee
unscathed
of
storm
or
stream
when
thy
sons
rose
up
and
thy
young
men
stood
together
one
equal
face
of
fight
and
my
flag
swam
high
as
the
swimming
feather
laughing
a
lamp
of
light
ah
the
lordly
laughter
and
light
of
it
that
lightened
the
whole
length
ah
the
hearts
of
heroes
pierced
the
bright
lips
whitened
of
strong
men
in
their
strength
ah
the
the
stretch
of
straightening
streamers
straining
their
full
reach
out
ah
the
hands
making
true
the
dreams
of
dreamers
the
hopes
brought
forth
in
doubt
ah
the
noise
of
horse
the
charge
and
thunder
of
drumming
and
swaying
and
sweep
of
swords
ah
the
light
that
led
them
through
of
the
life
coming
clear
of
its
lies
and
lords
by
the
lightning
of
the
lips
of
guns
whose
flashes
made
plain
the
strayed
way
by
the
flame
that
left
her
dead
old
sins
in
ashes
swept
out
of
sight
of
day
by
thy
children
whose
bare
feet
were
shod
with
thunder
their
bare
hands
mailed
with
fire
by
the
faith
that
went
with
them
waking
fear
and
wonder
love
and
high
desire
by
the
tumult
of
the
waves
of
nations
waking
blind
in
the
loud
wide
night
by
the
wind
that
went
on
the
waste
waters
making
their
marble
darkness
white
as
the
flash
of
the
flakes
of
the
foam
flared
lamplike
leaping
from
wave
to
gladdening
wave
making
wide
the
eyes
of
thraldom
sleeping
the
sleep
of
the
unclean
grave
by
the
fire
of
equality
terrible
devouring
divine
that
brought
forth
good
by
the
lands
it
purged
and
wasted
and
left
flowering
with
bloom
of
brotherhood
by
the
lips
of
fraternity
that
for
sake
uttered
fierce
words
and
fires
of
death
but
the
eyes
were
deep
as
and
the
fierce
lips
fluttered
with
own
living
breath
by
thy
weaponed
hands
brows
helmed
and
bare
feet
spurning
the
bared
head
of
a
king
by
the
storm
of
sunrise
round
thee
risen
and
burning
why
hast
thou
done
this
thing
thou
hast
mixed
thy
limbs
with
the
son
of
a
harlot
a
stranger
mouth
to
mouth
limb
to
limb
thou
bride
of
a
god
because
of
the
bridesman
danger
to
bring
forth
seed
to
him
for
thou
thoughtest
inly
the
terrible
bridegroom
wakes
me
when
i
would
sleep
to
go
the
fire
of
his
mouth
consumes
and
the
red
kiss
shakes
me
more
bitter
than
a
blow
rise
up
my
beloved
go
forth
to
meet
the
stranger
put
forth
thine
arm
he
saith
fear
thou
not
at
all
though
the
bridesman
should
be
danger
the
bridesmaid
should
be
death
i
the
bridegroom
am
i
not
with
thee
o
bridal
nation
o
wedded
france
to
strive
to
destroy
the
sins
of
the
earth
with
divine
devastation
till
none
be
left
alive
lo
her
growths
of
sons
foliage
of
men
and
frondage
broad
boughs
of
the
tree
with
iron
of
shame
and
with
of
bondage
they
are
shorn
from
sea
to
sea
lo
i
set
wings
to
thy
feet
that
have
been
wingless
till
the
utter
race
be
run
till
the
priestless
temples
cry
to
the
thrones
made
kingless
are
we
not
also
undone
till
the
immeasurable
republic
arise
and
lighten
above
these
quick
and
dead
and
her
awful
robes
be
changed
and
her
red
robes
whiten
her
of
red
but
thou
wouldst
not
saying
i
am
weary
and
faint
to
follow
let
me
lie
down
and
rest
and
hast
sought
out
shame
to
sleep
with
mire
to
wallow
yea
a
much
fouler
breast
and
thine
own
hast
made
prostitute
sold
and
shamed
and
bared
it
thy
bosom
which
was
mine
and
the
bread
of
the
word
i
gave
thee
hast
soiled
and
shared
it
among
these
snakes
and
swine
as
a
harlot
thou
wast
handled
and
polluted
thy
faith
held
light
as
foam
that
thou
sentest
men
thy
sons
thy
sons
imbruted
to
slay
thine
elder
rome
therefore
o
harlot
i
gave
thee
to
the
accurst
one
by
night
to
be
defiled
to
thy
second
shame
and
a
fouler
than
the
first
one
that
got
thee
first
with
child
yet
i
know
thee
turning
back
now
to
behold
me
to
bow
thee
and
make
thee
bare
not
for
sake
but
penitence
by
my
feet
to
hold
me
and
wipe
them
with
thine
hair
and
sweet
ointment
of
thy
grief
thou
hast
brought
thy
master
and
set
before
thy
lord
from
a
box
of
flawed
and
broken
alabaster
thy
broken
spirit
poured
and
tears
and
perfumes
hast
thou
given
me
to
reach
my
feet
and
touch
therefore
thy
sins
which
are
many
are
forgiven
thee
because
thou
hast
loved
much
genesis
in
the
outer
world
that
was
before
this
earth
that
was
before
all
shape
or
space
was
born
before
the

of

before

knew
the

yea
before
any

had
any
light
or
anything
called
god
or
man
drew
breath
slowly
the
strong
sides
of
the
heaving
night
moved
and
brought
forth
the
strength
of
life
and
death
and
the
sad
shapeless
horror
increate
that
was
all
things
and
one
thing
without
fruit
limit
or
law
where
love
was
none
nor
hate
where
no

came

the

then

the

the
immortal

of

send
us
a

oversea
of

through
with
the
winds
of

reform
a

in
the

deaths
by

ride
with

and
clamours
of

with

note
shriller

here
eyes

kings

how

our

be
the

how
in
confusion

how

songs
praising
his

buried

dead
to
us
even
the
spirit
of

freedom
so
have
they
said
to
us
some
with
mocking
and
mirth
some
with
heartbreak
and
tears
and
a
god
without
eyes
without
ears
who
shall
sing
of
him
dead
in
the
birth
the
freedom
the
lonely
face
lightening
the
footprint
unshod
not
as
one
man
crucified
only
nor
scourged
with
but
one
rod
the
soul
that

substance
of

reincarnate
with
fresh
generations
the
great
god
man
which
is
god
but
in
weariest
of

and
obscurest
doth
it
live
not
at

the

if

it

there
was
fire
in

and
the
hunger
of
fight
in

naked
and
strong
they
went
forth
in
her
strength
like
flame
for
her
and
her
sake
of

her
republican
name

their
children
by

made
quiet
by

made

better

thy

thy

thy

she

dead
in

as

if
ye

come

chidden
scourged
of
thy

wounded
of
thy

we
have
known
thee
and
have
not

thee
stood
beside
thee
felt
thy
lips
breathe
set
foot
where
thy
feet
trod
loved
and
renounced
and
worshipped
and
denied
thee
as
though
thou
wert
but
as
another
god
hour
for
sleep
we
said
yet
one
other
all
day
we
served
her
and
who
shall
serve
by
night
not
knowing
of
thee
thy
face
not
knowing
o
mother
o
light
wherethrough
the
darkness
is
as
light
men
that
forsook
thee
hast
thou
not
forsaken
races
of
men
that
knew
not
hast
thou
known
nations
that
slept
thou
hast
doubted
not
to
waken
worshippers
of
strange
gods
to
make
thine

all
old
grey
histories
hiding
thy
clear
features
o
secret
spirit
and
sovereign
all
tales
creeds
woven
of
men
thy
children
and
thy
creatures
they
have
woven
for
vestures
of
thee
and
for

thine
hands
without
election
or

feed
all
men
fainting
from
false
peace
or

o
thou
the
resurrection

the

and
the
manhood
and

thy
wings
shadow
the

thine
eyes
lighten
the
horror
of
the
hollows
of
the
night
the
depths
of
the
earth
and
the
dark
places
brighten
under
thy
feet
whiter
than
fire
is
white
death
is
subdued
to
thee
and
bands
broken
where
thou
art
only
is
heaven
who
hears
not
thee
time
shall
not
hear
him
when
names
are
spoken
a
nameless
sign
of
death
shall
his

be
deathless
shall
be
the
death
the

be
nameless
sterile
of

his
twilight
time
of
breath
with
fire
of
hell
shall
shame
consume
him
shameless
and
dying
all
the
night
darken
his
death
the
years
are
as
thy
garments
the
ages
as
sandals
bound
and
loosed
from
thy
swift
feet
time
serves
before
thee
as
one
that
hath
for
wages
praise
or
shame
only
bitter
words
or
sweet
thou
sayest
done
and
all
a
century
kindles
again
thou
sayest
from
sight
of
me
and
all
the
light
of
face
of
all
men
dwindles
and
the
age
is
as
the
broken
glass
of
thee
the
night
is
as
a
seal
set
on
faces
on
faces
fallen
of
men
that
take
no
light
nor
give
light
in
the
deeps
of
the
dark
places
blind
things
incorporate
with
the
body
of
night
their
souls
are
serpents
winterbound
and
frozen
their
shame
is
as
a
tame
beast
at
their
feet
couched
their
cold
lips
deride
thee
and
thy
chosen
their
lying
lips
made
grey
with
dust
for
meat
then
when
their
time
is
full
and
days
run
over
the
splendour
of
thy
sudden
brow
made
bare
darkens
the
morning
thy
bared
hands
uncover
the
veils
of
light
and
night
and
the
awful
air
and
the
world
naked
as
a
maiden
stands
virginal
and
splendid
as
at
birth
with
all
thine
heaven
of
all
its
light
unladen
of
all
its
love
unburdened
all
thine
earth
for
the
utter
earth
and
the
utter

of

and
the
extreme
depth
is
thine
and
the
extreme
height
shadows
of
things
and
veils
of

riven
are
as
kings
unkingdomed
in
thy

through
the
iron
years
the
centuries
by
the
barred
impenetrable
doors
from
the
evening
to

have
we

the

the

and
though
many
a

close

and
tremble
how

they
tremble
at
all
who
love
thee
as

i
am
thine
harp
between
thine

o

all
my
strong

are

with

of

we

as

the

i

o

i

thee
that

then
if

burn
up

as

thou
from

shalt
cherish
the

that

mine
reared
between

each

that
trills

of

and
i
have
not
said
thou

not
nor
all
thy
night
long
have
denied
thy
day
darkness
to
daylight
shall
lift
up
thy
pæan
hill
to
hill
thunder
vale
cry
back
to

with
as
of
eagles
æschylean
and
sappho
singing
in
the
nightingale
sung
to
by
mighty
sons
of
dawn
and
daughters
of
this
songs
thine
ear
shall
keep
but
one
that
supreme
song
which
shook
the
channelled
waters
and
called
thee
skyward
as
god
calls
the
sun
come
though
all
heaven
again
be
fire
above
thee
though
death
before
thee
come
to

thy

let

but
see
in

who
love
thee
yea
though
thou
slay
us
arise
and
let
us
die
a
marching
song
we
mix
from
many
lands
we
march
for
very
far
in
hearts
and
lips
and

our
staffs
and

are
the
light
we
walk
in
darkens
sun
and
moon
and

it
doth
not
flame
and
wane
with
years
and
spheres
that
roll
storm
can
not
shake
nor
stain
the
strength
that
makes
it
whole
the
fire
that
moulds
and
moves
it
of
the
sovereign
soul
we
are
they
that
have
to
cope
with
time
till
time
retire
we
live
on
hopeless
hope
we
feed
on
tears
and
fire
time
foot
by
foot
gives
back
before
our
sheer
desire
from
the
edge
of
harsh
derision
from
discord
and
defeat
from
doubt
and
lame
division
we
pluck
the
fruit
and
eat
and
the
mouth
finds
it
bitter
and
the
spirit
sweet
we
strive
with
time
at
wrestling
till
time
be
on
our
side
and
hope
our
plumeless
nestling
a
eaglet
ride
down
the
loud
length
of
storm
its
windward
wings

are
girt
with
our

clothed
with
our
will
and
crowned
hope
fear
delight
and
grief

our
will
give
ground
their
calls
are
in
our
ears
as
shadows
of
dead
sound
all
but
the
heart
forsakes
us
all
fails
us
but
the
will
keen
treason
tracks
and
takes
us
in
pits
for
blood
to
fill
friend
falls
from
friend
and
faith
for
faith
lays
wait
to
kill
out
under

and

of
the
urgent
sun
whose

our

o

these
thou
that
wast

wilt
thou
clasp
their
knees
these
royalties
these
lies
that
keep
thine
head
and
sunlike
strength
of
eyes
from
the
open
heaven
and
air
of
intercepted
skies
these
princelings
with
gauze
winglets
that
buzz
in
the

unfurled
these
kinglets
these
thin
worms
crowned
and
curled
that
bask
and
blink
and
warm
themselves
about
the

these
fanged
meridian
vermin
shrill
gnats
that
crowd
the
dusk
whose
nestling
ermine
smells
foul
of
mould
and
musk
blind
hatched
by
dark
and
hampered
in
their
husk
these

without

these
gods
of

this

to
keep
her
heart
from

no
memory
more
of
men
that
brought
it
fire
of
old
these
limbs
supine
unbuckled
in
rottenness
of

these
sleepy
lips
and
satiate
of
thy
breast
these
dull
wide
mouths
that
drain
thee
dry
and
call
thee
blest
these
masters
of

mindless
that
wear
thee
out

these
children
of

kindless
that
use
thee
out
of
kind
whose

strew
gold
before
thee

have
turned
thy
name
to
laughter
thy
sounded
name
that
now
none
hearkens
after
for
faith
in
its
free
fame
who
have
robbed
thee
of
thy
trust

thee

thy

our

for
all
thy

thrown
by

this
that

made
thine

so
high
with
empire
and
with
treason
the
first
right
hand
made
fast
but
in
nobler
season
to
put
forth

the

love
turns
from
thee
and

disavows
thy

lest
thine

disclaim

thine

lift
up

thee

thine

bathes
deep
in
the
air
that
flows
round
no
fair
thing
more
fair
her
beauty
bare
there
the
utter
sky
is
holier
there
more
pure
the
intense
white
height
of
air
more
clear
eyes
that
mine
would
meet
and
the
sweet
springs
of
things
more
sweet
there
for
this
one
warm
note
of
doves
a
clamour
of
a
thousand
loves
storms
the
ear
the
assails
from
the
tempestuous
nightingales
and
fills
and
fails
o
gracious
city
italian
and
a
maiden
crowned
siena
my
feet
are
no
more
moved
toward
thy
but
my
heart
in
me
turns
and
moves
o
lady
loveliest
of
my
loves
toward
thee
to
lie
before
thy
feet
and
gaze
from
thy
fair
up
the
sheer
street
and
the
house
midway
hanging
see
that
saw
saint
catherine
bodily
felt
on
its
floors
her
sweet
feet
move
and
the
live
light
of
fiery
love
burn
from
her
beautiful
strange
face
as
in
the
sanguine
sacred
place
where
in
pure
hands
she
took
the
head
severed
and
with
pure
lips
still
red
kissed
the
lips
dead
for
years
through
sweetest
of
the
saints
in
quiet
without
cease
she
wrought
till
cries
of
men
and
fierce
complaints
from
outward
moved
her
maiden
thought
and
prayers
she
heard
and
sighs
toward
france
send
us
back
deliverance
send
back
thy
servant
lest
we
die
with
an
exceeding
bitter
cry
they
smote
the
sky
then
in
her
sacred
saving
hands
she
took
the
sorrows
of
the
lands
with
maiden
palms
she
lifted
up
the
sick
cup
and
in
her
virgin
garment
furled
the
faint
limbs
of
a
wounded
world
clothed
with
calm
love
and
clear
desire
she
went
forth
in
her
attire
a
missive
fire
across
the
might
of
men
that
strove
it
shone
and
over
heads
of
kings
and
molten
in
red
flames
of
love
were
swords
and
many
monstrous
things
and
shields
were
lowered
and
snapt
were
spears
and
the
clamorous
years
and
faith
came
back
and
peace
that
were
fled
for
she
bade
saying
heir
hast
thou
no
care
men
lay
waste
thine
heritage
still
and
much
heathen
people
rage
against
thee
and
devise
vain
things
what
comfort
in
the
face
of
kings
what
counsel
is
there
turn
thine
eyes
and
thine
heart
from
them
in
like
wise
turn
thee
unto
thine
holy
place
to
help
us
that
of
god
for
grace
require
thy
face
who
shall
hear
us
if
not
thou
in
a
strange
land
what
doest
thou
there
thy
sheep
are
spoiled
and
the
ploughers
plough
upon
us
why
hast
thou
no
care
for
all
this
and
beyond
strange
hills
liest
unregardful
what
snow
chills
thy
foldless
flock
or
what
rains
beat
lo
in
thine
ears
before
thy
feet
thy
lost
sheep
bleat
strange
men
feed
on
faultless
lives
and
there
is
blood
and
men
put
knives
shepherd
unto
the
young
throat
and
one
hath
eaten
and
one
smote
and
one
had
hunger
and
is
fed
full
of
the
flesh
of
these
and
red
with
blood
of
these
as
who
drinks
wine
and
god
knoweth
who
hath
sent
thee
a
sign
if
these
were
but
the
heart
within
him
burned
so
that
he
rose
up
seeing
the
sign
and
came
among
them
but
she
turned
back
to
her
daily
way
divine
and
fed
her
faith
with
silent
things
and
lived
her
life
with
curbed
white
wings
and
mixed
herself
with
heaven
and
died
and
now
on
the
sheer
smiles
like
a
bride
you
see
her
in
the
fresh
clear
gloom
where
walls
shut
out
the
flame
and
bloom
of
summer
and
the
roof
keeps
the
keen
ardent
air
aloof
and
sweet
weight
of
the
violent
sky
there
bodily
beheld
on
high
she
seems
as
one
hearing
in
tune
heaven
within
heaven
at
full
noon
in
sacred
swoon
a
solemn
swoon
of
sense
that
aches
with
imminent
blind
heat
of
heaven
while
all
the
spirit
wakes
vigilant
of
the
supreme
seven
whose
choral
flames
in
sight
move
made
unendurable
with
love
that
without
wind
or
blast
of
breath
compels
all
things
through
life
and
death
whither
god
saith
there
on
the
dim
wall
thy
mighty
touch
memorial
razzi
raised
up
for
ages
dead
and
fixed
for
us
her
heavenly
head
and
rent
with
plaited
thorn
and
rod
bared
the
live
likeness
of
her
god
to
eyes
turning
from
strange
lands
where
pale
from
thine
immortal
hands
christ
wounded
stands
and
the
blood
blots
his
holy
hair
and
white
brows
over
hungering
eyes
that
plead
against
us
and
the
fair
mute
lips
forlorn
of
words
or
sighs
in
the
great
torment
that
bends
down
his
bruised
head
with
the
bloomless
crown
white
as
the
unfruitful
a
god
beheld
in
dreams
that
were
beheld
of
her
in
vain
on
all
these
sins
and
years
falls
the
sad
blood
fall
the
slow
tears
in
vain
poured
forth
as
watersprings
priests
on
your
altars
and
ye
kings
about
your
seats
of
sanguine
gold
still
your
god
spat
upon
and
sold
bleeds
at
your
hands
but
now
is
gone
all
his
flock
from
him
saving
one
judas
alone
surely
your
race
it
was
that
he
o
men
signed
backward
with
his
name
beholding
in
gethsemane
bled
the
red
bitter
sweat
of
shame
knowing
how
the
word
of
christian
should
mean
to
men
evil
and
not
good
seem
to
men
shameful
for
your
sake
whose
lips
for
all
the
prayers
they
make
blood
must
slake
but
blood
nor
tears
ye
love
not
you
that
my
love
leads
my
longing
to
fair
as
the
old
faith
of
flowers
o
golden
goddesses
of
ours
from
what
idalian
hath
aphrodite
bidden
glance
the
lovelier
lightnings
of
your
feet
from
what
sweet
paphian
sward
or
seat
led
you
more
sweet
o
white
three
sisters
three
as
one
with
flowerlike
arms
for
flowery
bands
your
linked
limbs
glitter
like
the
sun
and
time
lies
beaten
at
your
hands
time
and
wild
years
and
wars
and
men
pass
and
ye
care
not
whence
or
when
with
calm
lips
over
sweet
for
scorn
ye
watch
night
pass
o
children
born
of
the
morn
ah
in
this
strange
and
shrineless
place
what
doth
a
goddess
what
a
grace
where
no
greek
worships
her
shrined
limbs
with
wreaths
and
cytherean
hymns
where
no
lute
makes
luxurious
the
adoring
airs
in
amathus
till
the
maid
knowing
her
mother
near
sobs
with
love
aching
with
sweet
fear
what
do
ye
here
for
the
outer
land
is
sad
and
wears
a
raiment
of
a
flaming
fire
and
the
fierce
fruitless
mountain
stairs
climb
yet
seem
wroth
and
loth
to
aspire
climb
and
break
and
are
broken
down
and
through
their
clefts
and
crests
the
town
looks
west
and
sees
the
dead
sun
lie
in
sanguine
death
that
stains
the
sky
with
angry
dye
and
from
the
wastes
without
in
twilight
in
the
time
of
doubt
one
sound
comes
of
one
whisper
where
moved
with
low
motions
of
slow
air
the
great
trees
nigh
the
castle
swing
in
the
sad
coloured
evening
di
small
sweet
word
alone
is
not
yet
gone
di
sound
sole
out
of
deep
dumb
days
remote
across
the
fiery
and
fatal
ground
comes
tender
as
a
hurt
note
to
where
a
ghost
with
empty
hands
a
ghost
her
palace
stands
in
the
mid
city
where
the
strong
bells
turn
the
sunset
air
to
song
and
the
towers
throng
with
other
face
with
speech
the
same
a
mightier
likeness
came
late
among
mourning
men
that
slept
a
sacred
ghost
that
went
and
wept
white
as
the
lamb
saying
remember
me
that
am
from
deep
sea
to
sea
earth
heard
earth
knew
her
that
this
was
she
made
me
of
all
things
fairest
thing
and
hate
unmade
me
this
knows
he
who
with
sacerdotal
ring
enringed
mine
hand
espousing
yea
in
thy
woe
yea
mother
hast
thou
not
said
so
have
not
our
hearts
within
us
stirred
o
thou
most
holiest
at
thy
word
have
we
not
heard
as
this
dead
tragic
land
that
she
found
deadly
such
was
time
to
thee
years
passed
thee
withering
in
the
red
maremma
years
that
deemed
thee
dead
ages
that
sorrowed
or
that
scorned
and
all
this
while
though
all
they
mourned
thou
sawest
the
end
of
things
unclean
and
the
unborn
that
should
see
thee
a
queen

we
not
seen
the
weary
poet
thy
sad
son
upon
thy
soil
under
thy
skies

all
italian

missed
his

we
what

thee

from
siena
southward
home
where
the
pall
hangs
rent
on
rome
and
through
the
red
rent
towards
thine

her
labouring
hands
look
thou
and
listen
and
let
be
all
the
dead
quick
all
the
bond
free

blind
eyes

there
be
sight
in
the
eighteen
centuries
of
the
night

there
be

bow
down
the
beauty
of
thine
head
sweet
and
with
lips
of
living
breath
kiss
thy
sons
sleeping
and
thy
dead
that
there
be
no
more
sleep
or
death
give
us
thy
light
thy
might
thy
love
whom
thy
face
seen
afar
above
drew
to
thy
feet
and
when
being
free
thou
hast
blest
thy
children
born
to
thee
bless
also
me
me
that
when
others
played
or
slept
sat
still
under
thy
cross
and
wept
me
who
so
early
and
unaware
felt
fall
on
bent
bared
brows
and
hair
thin
drops
of
the
overflowing
flood
the
bitter
blessing
of
thy
blood
the
sacred
shadow
of
thy
pain
thine
the
true
slain
and
raised
again

consecrated

praise
thee

cling
about
the
intolerable
tree
whereto
they
had
nailed
my
heart
and
thee
and
said
for

thee

thee
alive

an
hour
before
the
hour
of

set
in
mine
hand
my

and
leave
me
here
outside
the
hollow
house
that
blind
men
fear
more
blind
than
i
who
live
on
life
withdrawn
and
feel
on
eyes
that
see
not
but
foresee
the
shadow
of
death
which
clothes
antigone
here
lay
her
living
body
that
here
lies
dead
if
man
living
know
what
thing
is
death
if
life
be
all
made
up
of
blood
and
breath
and
no
sense
be
save
as
of
ears
and
eyes
but
heart
there
is
not
tongue
there
is
not
found
to
think
or
sing
what
verge
hath
life
or
bound
in
the
beginning
when
the
powers
that
made
the
young
child
man
a
little
loved
him
seeing
his
joy
of
life
and
fair
face
of
his
being

bland
and
laughing
with
the
played
as
friends
they
saw
on
our
divine
one
day
king
cadmus
take
to
queen
harmonia
the
strength
of
soul
that
builds
up
as
with
hands
walls
spiritual
and
towers
and
towns
of
thought
which
only
fate
not
force
can
bring
to
nought
took
then
to

the

of
all

most
sweet

order
of

it
was
long
since
yea
even
the
sun
that
saw
remembers
hardly
what
was
nor
how
long
and
now
the
wise
heart
of
the
worldly
song
is
perished
and
the
holy
hand
of
law
can
set
no
tune
on
time
nor
help
again
the
power
of
thought
to
build
up
life
for
men
yea
surely
are
they
now
transformed
or
dead
and
sleep
below
this
world
where
no
sun
warms
or
move
about
it
now
in
formless
forms
incognizable
and
all
their
lordship
fled
and
where
they
stood
up
singing
crawl
and
hiss
with
fangs
that
kill
behind
their
lips
that
kiss
yet
though
her
seeming
fair
was
dyed
in
sin
and
woven
of
jealousy
to
turn
their
seed
to
poison
time
shall
see
the
gods
reissue
from
them
and
repair
their
broken
stamp
of
godhead
and
again
thought
and
wise
love
sing
words
of
law
to
men
i
tiresias
the
prophet
seeing
in

much
evil
and
the
misery
of
hands
who
sow
with
fruitless
wheat
the
stones
and
sands
with
fruitful
thorns
the
fallows

warm
glebes
bade
their

hold

came
to

which
of
you

i
am
as
self
in
mine
own
wearied
mind
whom
the
strong
years
have
led
from
night
to
night
and
dead
men
unto
dead
and
from
the
blind
hope
to
the
memory
blind
for
each
life

woven
as
life
is
of
blind
young
hopes
and
old
blind

i
am
a
soul
outside
of
death
and
birth
i
see
before
me
and
afterward
i
see
o
child
o
corpse
the
live
dead
face
of
thee
whose
life
and
death
are
one
thing
upon
earth
where
day
kills
night
and
night
again
kills
day
and
dies
but
where
is
that
harmonia
o
light
not
seen
of
me
air
and
warm
winds
that
under
the
eye
stretch
your
strong
wings
at

i
hear
a
springing
water
whose
quick
sound
makes
softer
the
soft
sunless
patient
air
and
the
hand
is
laid
on
my
thin
hair
light
as
a
and
the
grasses
round
have
odours
in
them
of
green
bloom
and
rain
sweet
as
the
kiss
wherewith
sleep
kisses
pain
i
hear
the
low
sound
of
the
spring
of
time
still
beating
as
the
low
live
throb
of
blood
and
where
its
waters
gather
head
and
flood
i
hear
change
moving
on
them
and
the
chime
across
them
of
reverberate
wings
of
hours
sounding
and
feel
the
future
air
of
flowers
the
wind
of
change
is
soft
as
snow
and
sweet
the
sense
thereof
as
roses
in
the
sun
the
faint
wind
springing
with
the
springs
that
run
the
dim
sweet
smell
of
flowering
hopes
and
heat
of
unbeholden
sunrise
yet
how
long
i
know
not
till
the
morning
put
forth
song
i
prophesy
of
life
who
live
with
death
of
joy
being
sad
of
sunlight
who
am
blind
of
man
whose
ways
are
alien
from
mankind
and
his
lips
are
not
parted
with
breath
i
am
a
word
out
of
the
speechless
years
the
tongue
of
time
that
no
man
sleeps
who
hears
i
stand
a
shadow
across
the
door
of
doom
athwart
the
lintel
of
house
and
wait
nor
quick
nor
dead
nor
flexible
by
fate
nor
quite
of
earth
nor
wholly
of
the
tomb
a
voice
a
vision
light
as
fire
or
air
driven
between
days
that
shall
be
and
that
were
i
prophesy
with
feet
upon
a
grave
of
death
cast
out
and
life
devouring
death
as
flame
doth
wood
and
stubble
with
a
breath
of
freedom
though
all
manhood
were
one
slave
of
truth
though
all
the
world
were
liar
of
love
that
time
nor
hate
can
raze
the
witness
of
life
that
was
given
for
sake
and
his
their
powers
have
no
more
power
on
they
divide
spoils
wrung
from
lust
or
wrath
of
man
or
pride
and
keen
oblivion
without
pity
or
pause
sets
them
on
fire
and
scatters
them
on
air
like
ashes
shaken
from
a
hair
but
life
they
lay
no
hand
on
life
once
given
no
force
of
theirs
hath
competence
to
take
life
that
was
given
for
some
divine
sake
to
mix
the
bitterness
of
earth
with
heaven
light
with
night
and
music
with
his
breath
dies
not
but
makes
its
living
food
of
death
i
have
seen
this
who
live
where
men
are
not
in
the
high
starless
air
of
fruitful
night
on
that
serenest
and
obscurest
height
where
dead
and
unborn
things
are
one
in
thought
and
whence
the
live
unconquerable
springs
feed
full
of
force
the
torrents
of
new
things
i
have
seen
this
who
saw
long
since
being
man
as
now
i
know
not
if
indeed
i
be
the
fair
bare
body
of
wisdom
good
to
see
and
evil
whence
my
light
and
night
began
light
on
the
goal
and
darkness
on
the
way
light
all
through
night
and
darkness
all
through
day
mother
that
by
that
pegasean
spring
didst
fold
round
in
thine
arms
thy
blinded
son
weeping
holiest
what
thing
hast
thou
done
what
to
my
child
me
that
see
the
thing
is
this
thy
love
to
and
hereof
must
i
take
sample
how
the
gods
can
love
child
thou
hast
seen
indeed
poor
child
of
mine
the
breasts
and
flanks
of
pallas
bare
in
sight
but
never
shalt
see
more
the
dear
light
o
helicon
how
great
a
pay
is
thine
for
some
poor
antelopes
and
dead
my
eyes
hast
thou
taken
in
their
mother
thou
knewest
not
what
she
had
to
give
thy
goddess
though
then
angered
for
mine
eyes
fame
and
foreknowledge
and
to
be
most
wise
and
centuries
of
life
to
live
and
in
mine
hand
this
guiding
staff
to
be
as
eyesight
to
the
feet
of
men
that
see
perchance
i
shall
not
die
at
all
nor
pass
the
general
door
and
lintel
of
men
dead
yet
even
the
very
tongue
of
wisdom
said
what
grace
should
come
with
death
to
tiresias
what
special
honour
that
hand
accord
who
gathers
all
nations
as
their
lord
and
sometimes
when
the
secret
eye
of
thought
is
changed
with
obscuration
and
the
sense
aches
with
long
pain
of
hollow
prescience
and
fiery
foresight
with
foresuffering
bought
seems
even
to
infect
my
spirit
and
consume
hunger
and
thirst
come
on
me
for
the
tomb
i
could
be
fain
to
drink
my
death
and
sleep
and
no
more
wrapped
about
with
bitter
dreams
talk
with
the
stars
and
with
the
winds
and
streams
and
with
the
inevitable
years
and
weep
for
how
should
he
who
communes
with
the
years
be
sometime
not
a
living
spring
of
tears
o
child
that
guided
of
thine
only
will
didst
set
thy
maiden
foot
against
the
gate
to
strike
it
open
ere
thine
hour
of
fate
antigone
men
say
not
thou
didst
ill
for
sake
and
the
reverence
of
his
awe
divinely
dying
slain
by
mortal
law
for
love
is
awful
as
immortal
death
and
through
thee
surely
hath
thy
brother
won
rest
out
of
sight
of
our
sun
and
in
the
dead
land
where
ye
ghosts
draw
breath
a
royal
place
and
honour
so
wast
thou
happy
though
earth
have
hold
of
thee
too
now
so
hast
thou
life
and
name
inviolable
and
joy
it
may
be
sacred
and
severe
joy
beyond
all
hope
or
fear
a
monumental
joy
wherein
to
dwell
secluse
and
silent
a
selected
state
serene
possession
of
thy
proper
fate
thou
art
not
dead
as
these
are
dead
who
live
full
of
blind
years
a
kind
nor
as
these
are
am
i
the
prophet
blind
they
have
not
life
that
have
not
heart
to
give
life
nor
have
eyesight
who
lack
heart
to
see
when
to
be
not
is
better
than
to
be
o
ye
whom
time
but
bears
with
for
a
span
how
long
will
ye
be
blind
and
dead
how
long
make
your
own
souls
part
of
your
own
wrong
son
of
the
word
of
the
most
high
gods
man
why
wilt
thou
make
thine
hour
of
light
and
breath
emptier
of
all
but
shame
than
very
death
fool
wilt
thou
live
for
ever
though
thou
care
with
all
thine
heart
for
life
to
keep
it
fast
shall
not
thine
hand
forego
it
at
the
last
lo
thy
sure
hour
shall
take
thee
by
the
hair
sleeping
or
when
thou
knowest
not
or
wouldst
fly
and
as
men
died
much
mightier
shalt
thou
die
yea
they
are
dead
men
much
more
worth
than
thou
the
savour
of
heroic
lives
that
were
is
it
not
mixed
into
thy
common
air
the
sense
of
them
is
shed
about
thee
now
feel
not
thy
brows
a
wind
blowing
from
far
aches
not
thy
forehead
with
a
future
star
the
light
that
thou
make
out
of
thy
name
is
in
the
wind
of
this
same
hour
that
drives
blown
within
reach
but
once
of
all
lives
and
he
that
puts
forth
hand
upon
the
flame
shall
have
it
for
a
garland
on
his
head
to
sign
him
for
a
king
among
the
dead
but
these
men
that
the
lessening
years
behold
who
sit
the
most
part
without
flame
or
crown
and
brawl
and
sleep
and
wear
their
down
with
joys
and
griefs
ignobler
than
of
old
and
care
not
if
the
better
day
shall
are
these
or
art
thou
dead
antigone
part
ii
as
when
one
wakes
out
of
a
waning
dream
and
sees
with
instant
eyes
the
naked
thought
whereof
the
vision
as
a
web
was
wrought
i
saw
beneath
a
heaven
of
cloud
and
gleam
ere
yet
the
heart
of
the
young
sun
waxed
brave
one
like
a
prophet
standing
by
a
grave
in
the
hoar
heaven
was
hardly
beam
or
breath
and
all
the
coloured
hills
and
fields
were
grey
and
the
wind
wandered
seeking
for
the
day
and
wailed
as
though
he
had
found
her
done
to
death
and
this
grey
hour
had
built
to
bury
her
the
hollow
twilight
for
a
sepulchre
but
in
my
soul
i
saw
as
in
a
glass
a
pale
and
living
body
full
of
grace
there
lying
and
over
it
the
face
fixed
and
the
face
was
not
of
tiresias
for
such
a
starry
fire
was
in
his
eyes
as
though
their
light
it
was
that
made
the
skies
such
eyes
should
have
been
when
very
love
looked
forth
of
them
and
set
the
sun
aflame
and
such
his
lips
that
called
the
light
by
name
and
bade
the
morning
forth
at
sound
thereof
his
face
was
sad
and
masterful
as
fate
and
like
a
his
look
compassionate
like
a
gazed
on
of
sad
eyes
so
long
it
seems
to
yearn
with
pity
and
all
its
fire
as
a
heart
to
tremble
with
desire
and
heave
as
though
the
light
would
bring
forth
song
yet
from
his
face
flashed
lightning
on
the
land
and
like
the
was
his
hand
the
steepness
of
strange
stairs
had
tired
his
feet
and
his
lips
yet
seemed
sick
of
that
salt
bread
wherewith
the
lips
of
banishment
are
fed
but
nothing
was
there
in
the
world
so
sweet
as
the
most
bitter
love
like
own
grace
wherewith
he
gazed
on
that
fair
buried
face
grief
and
glad
pride
and
passion
and
sharp
shame
wrath
and
remembrance
faith
and
hope
and
hate
and
pitiless
pity
of
days
degenerate
were
in
his
eyes
as
an
incorporate
flame
that
burned
about
her
and
the
heart
thereof
and
central
flower
was
very
fire
of
love
but
all
about
her
grave
wherein
she
slept
were
noises
of
the
wild
years
whose
footprints
flying
were
full
of
blood
and
tears
shrieks
as
of
mænads
on
their
hills
that
leapt
and
yelled
as
beasts
of
ravin
and
their
meat
was
the
rent
flesh
of
their
own
sons
to
eat
and
fiery
shadows
passing
with
strange
cries
and
shapes
about
the
ruined
lands
and
the
red
reek
of
parricidal
hands
and
intermixture
of
incestuous
eyes
and
light
as
of
that
flame
which
made
an
end
of
the
cadmean
name
and
i
beheld
again
and
lo
the
grave
and
the
bright
body
laid
therein
as
dead
and
the
same
shadow
across
another
head
that
bowed
down
silent
on
that
sleeping
slave
who
was
the
lady
of
empire
from
her
birth
and
light
of
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
earth
within
the
compass
of
the
hand
all
strengths
of
other
men
and
divers
powers
were
held
at
ease
and
gathered
up
as
flowers
his
heart
was
as
the
heart
of
his
whole
land
and
at
his
feet
as
natural
servants
lay
twilight
and
dawn
and
night
and
labouring
day
he
was
most
awful
of
the
sons
of
god
even
now
men
seeing
seemed
at
his
lips
to
see
the
trumpet
of
the
judgment
that
should
be
and
in
his
right
hand
terror
for
a
rod
and
in
the
breath
that
made
the
mountains
bow
the
horned
fire
of
moses
on
his
brow
the
strong
wind
of
the
coming
of
the
lord
had
blown
as
flame
upon
him
and
brought
down
on
his
bare
head
from
heaven
fire
for
a
crown
and
fire
was
girt
upon
him
as
a
sword
to
smite
and
lighten
and
on
what
ways
he
trod
there
fell
from
him
the
shadow
of
a
god
pale
with
the
whole
judgment
in
his
eyes
he
stood
and
saw
the
grief
and
shame
endure
that
he
though
highest
of
angels
might
not
cure
and
the
same
sins
done
under
the
same
skies
and
the
same
slaves
to
the
same
tyrants
thrown
and
fain
he
would
have
slept
and
fain
been
stone
but
with
unslumbering
eyes
he
watched
the
sleep
that
sealed
her
sense
whose
eyes
were
suns
of
old
and
the
night
shut
and
opened
and
behold
the
same
grave
where
those
prophets
came
to
weep
but
she
that
lay
therein
had
moved
and
stirred
and
where
those
twain
had
watched
her
stood
a
third
the
tripled
rhyme
that
closed
in
paradise
with
name
sealing
up
its
starry
the
tripled
might
of
hand
that
found
in
reach
all
crowns
beheld
far
off
of
all
eyes
song
colour
carven
wonders
of
live
these
were
not
but
the
very
soul
alone
the
living
spirit
the
good
gift
of
grace
the
faith
which
takes
of
its
own
blood
to
give
that
the
dead
veins
of
buried
hope
may
live
came
on
her
sleeping
face
to
naked
face
and
from
a
soul
more
sweet
than
all
the
south
breathed
love
upon
her
sealed
and
breathless
mouth
between
her
lips
the
breath
was
blown
as
fire
and
through
her
flushed
veins
leapt
the
liquid
life
and
with
sore
passion
and
ambiguous
strife
the
new
birth
rent
her
and
the
new
desire
the
will
to
live
the
competence
to
be
the
sense
to
hearken
and
the
soul
to
see
and
the
third
prophet
standing
by
her
grave
stretched
forth
his
hand
and
touched
her
and
her
eyes
opened
as
sudden
suns
in
heaven
might
rise
and
her
soul
caught
from
his
the
faith
to
save
faith
above
creeds
faith
beyond
records
born
of
the
pure
naked
fruitful
awful
morn
for
in
the
daybreak
now
that
night
was
dead
the
light
the
shadow
the
delight
the
pain
the
purpose
and
the
passion
of
those
twain
seemed
gathered
on
that
third
prophetic
head
and
all
their
crowns
were
as
one
crown
and
one
his
face
with
her
face
in
the
living
sun
for
even
with
that
communion
of
their
eyes
his
whole
soul
passed
into
her
and
made
her
strong
and
all
the
sounds
and
shows
of
shame
and
wrong
the
hand
that
slays
the
lip
that
mocks
and
lies
temples
and
thrones
that
yet
men
seem
to
are
these

come
to

on

downs
a
faint
sea
without
wind
or

a
sky
like
flameless
vapour
dun
a
valley
like
an
unsealed
grave
that
no
man
cares
to
weep
upon
bare
without
boon
to
crave
or
flower
to
save
and
on
the
edge
of
the
down
here
where
the
burns
to
brown
in
the
dry
and
the
heath
crawls
to
the
and
looks
down
i
watch
and
hear
beneath
the
low
tide
breathe
along
the
long
lines
of
the
cliff
down
the
flat
without
skiff
or
sail
or
fume
for
mark
through
heads
of
heath
and
stiff
stems
blossomless
and
stark
with
dry
sprays
dark
i
send
mine
eyes
out
as
for
news
of
comfort
that
all
these
refuse
tidings
of
light
or
living
air
from
windward
where
the
low
clouds
muse
and
the
sea
blind
and
bare
seems
full
of
care
so
is
it
now
as
it
was
then
and
as
men
have
been
such
are
men
there
as
i
stood
i
seem
to
stand
here
sitting
chambered
and
again
feel
spread
on
either
hand
sky
sea
and
land
as
a
queen
taken
and
stripped
and
bound
sat
earth
discoloured
and
discrowned
as
a
palace
empty
and
dead
the
sky
was
without
light
or
sound
and
on
the
head
were
ashes
shed
scarce
wind
enough
was
on
the
sea
scarce
hope
enough
there
moved
in
me
to
sow
with
live
blown
flowers
of
white
the
green
sad
serenity
or
with
stray
thoughts
of
light
touch
my
sight
by
footless
ways
and
sterile
went
my
thought
unsatisfied
and
bent
with
blank
unspeculative
eyes
on
the
untracked
sands
of
discontent
where
watched
of
helpless
skies
life
hopeless
lies
east
and
west
went
my
soul
to
find
light
and
the
world
was
bare
and
blind
and
the
soil
herbless
where
she
trod
and
saw
men
laughing
scourge
mankind
unsmitten
by
the
rod
of
any
god
out
of
blind
old
eyes
were
shed
tears
that
were
mortal
and
left
dead
the
heart
and
spirit
of
the
years
and
on
mans
fallen
and
helmless
head
disanointing
tears
fell
cold
as
fears
hope
flowering
had
but
strength
to
bear
the
fruitless
fruitage
of
despair
grief
trod
the
grapes
of
joy
for
wine
whereof
love
drinking
unaware
died
as
one
undivine
and
made
no
sign
and
soul
and
body
dwelt
apart
and
weary
wisdom
without
heart
stared
on
the
dead
round
heaven
and
sighed
death
too
hollow
as
thou
art
or
as
living
pride
and
saying
so
died
and
my
soul
heard
the
songs
and
groans
that
are
about
and
under
thrones
and
felt
through
all
murmur
thrill
old
imperious
semitones
that
made
of
good
and
ill
one
same
tune
still
then
is
god
and
where
is
aid
or
what
good
end
of
these
she
said
there
no
god
or
end
at
all
nor
reason
with
unreason
weighed
nor
force
to
disenthral
weak
feet
that
fall
light
to
lighten
and
no
rod
to
chasten
men
is
there
no
god
so
girt
with
anguish
went
my
soul
weeping
as
she
trod
between
the
men
enthroned
and
men
that
groaned
o
fool
that
for
brute
cries
of
wrong
heard
not
the
grey
glad
song
ring
response
from
the
hills
and
waves
but
heard
harsh
noises
all
day
long
of
spirits
that
were
slaves
and
dwelt
in
graves
the
wise
word
of
the
secret
earth
who
knows
what
life
and
death
are
worth
and
how
no
help
and
no
control
can
speed
or
stay
things
come
to
birth
nor
all
wheels
that
roll
crush
one
born
soul
with
all
her
tongues
of
life
and
death
with
all
her
bloom
and
blood
and
breath
from
all
years
dead
and
all
things
done
in
the
ear
of
man
the
mother
saith
is
no
god
o
son
if
thou
be
so
my
soul
sick
with
watching
heard
that
day
the
wonder
of
that
word
and
as
one
springs
out
of
a
dream
sprang
and
the
stagnant
wells
were
stirred
whence
flows
through
gloom
and
gleam
soundless
stream
out
of
pale
cliff
and
sunburnt
health
out
of
the
low
sea
curled
beneath
in
the
bending
arm
embayed
out
of
all
lives
that
thought
hears
breathe
life
within
life
inlaid
was
answer
made
a
multitudinous
monotone
of
dust
and
flower
and
seed
and
stone
in
the
deep
sloth
in
the
live
trembling
zone
in
all
men
love
and
loathe
one
god
at
growth
one
forceful
nature
uncreate
that
feeds
itself
with
death
and
fate
evil
and
good
and
change
and
time
that
within
all
men
lies
at
wait
till
the
hour
shall
bid
them
climb
and
live
sublime
for
all
things
come
by
fate
to
flower
at
their
unconquerable
hour
and
time
brings
truth
and
truth
makes
free
and
freedom
fills
veins
with
power
as
brooding
on
that
sea
my
thought
filled
me
and
the
sun
smote
the
clouds
and
slew
and
from
the
sun
the
breath
blew
and
white
waves
laughed
and
turned
and
fled
the
long
green
heaving
through
and
on
them
overhead
the
sky
burnt
red
like
a
furled
flag
that
wind
sets
free
on
the
swift
sea
shook
out
the
red
lines
of
the
light
the
live
standard
blown
to
lee
across
the
live
white
and
green
delight
and
with
divine
triumphant
awe
my
spirit
moved
within
me
saw
with
burning
passion

stretched
eyes

firstborn

and
shame

ye
lie
dead
and
naked
dying
for
a
ant
o
kings
and
queens
and
nations
miserable
o
fools
and
blind
and
full
of
sins
and
fears
with
these
it
is
with
you
it
is
not
well
ye
have
one
hour
but
these
the
immortal
years
these
for
a
pang
a
breath
a
pulse
of
pain
have
honour
while
that
honour
on
earth
shall
be
ye
for
a
little
sleep
and
sloth
shall
gain
scorn
while
one
man
of
all
men
born
is
free
even
as
the
depth
more
deep
than
night
or
day
the
sovereign
heaven
that
keeps
its
eldest
way
so
without
chance
or
change
so
without
stain
the
heaven
of
their
high
memories
shall
nor
wax
nor
wane
ant
as
the
soul
on
the
lips
of
the
dead
stands
poising
her
wings
for
flight
a
bird
scarce
quit
of
her
prison
but
fair
without
form
or
flesh
so
stands
over
each
head
a
splendour
of
imminent
light
a
glory
of
fame
rearisen
of
day
rearisen
afresh
from
the
hells
of
night
in
the
hundred
cities
of
crete
such
glory
was
not
of
old
though
her
name
was
great
upon
earth
and
her
face
was
fair
on
the
sea
the
words
of
her
lips
were
sweet
her
days
were
woven
with
gold
her
fruits
came
timely
to
birth
so
fair
she
was
being
free
who
is
bought
and
sold
so
fair
who
is
fairer
now
with
her
children
dead
at
her
side
unsceptred
unconsecrated
unapparelled
unhelped
unpitied
with
blood
for
gold
on
her
brow
where
the
towery
tresses
divide
the
goodly
the
made
like
as
a
bride
and
these
are
the
gifts
anguish
that
straitens
the
breath
shame
and
the
weeping
of
mothers
and
the
suckling
dead
at
the
breast
white
breast
that
a
long
sob
lifts
and
the
dumb
dead
mouth
which
saith
long
and
how
long
my
brothers
and
wrath
which
endures
not
rest
and
the
pains
of
death
ant
ah
but
would
that
men
with
eyelids
purged
by
tears
saw
and
heard
again
with
consecrated
ears
all
the
clamour
all
the
splendour
all
the
slain
all
the
lights
and
sounds
of

off

with

pyre
the
myriad
flames
of
fate

by
soul
transfigured
in
funereal
fire
hate
made
weak
by
love

love
made
strong
by

many
a
nursing

old
men

the
breach

death
sat
down
a
guest

triumphant
lamentation
made
for
each

the
world
salute
their
ruin
and
their
rest
in
one
iron
hour
the
crescent
flared
and
waned
as
from
tower
to
tower
and
death
with
flame
in

an
open
bloodred
flower
passed

nurse

obscure
funereal
places

again
thy
sacred

lift
the
light
up
of
thine
eyes
where
are
they
of
all
thy
dead
that

more
than
these
men
dying
in
their
godlike
grecian
wise
not
with
garments
rent
and
sighing
neither
gifts
of
myrrh
and
gold
shall
their
sons
lament
them
lying

the
fame
of

wax
cold

milk

dead
on
the
dead
lips
by
old
white
unviolated
hair
by
sweet
unburied
faces

fill
those
red
high
places

death

freedom
found
one
lair

thy

cleanse

stand
off
afar

thou
with
sudden

again
the
beauty
of
thy
brows
on

thy
white
and
woundless
brows

bows
give
her
the
glories

thine

thee

thee

thee

she
looked
along
the
knife
smiling

watched
the
thick
drops
mix
and
run
down
the
sheer
blade
not
that
which
had
been
done

hurt
the
sweet
sense

that
which

the

shone
before

such

as
when
with
love
her
lips
and
hands
were
fed
and
with
mute
mouth
out
of
the
dusty
dead
strove
to
make
answer

must
her
lifeblood
feel
the
fang
that
stung
her
sleeping
the
foul
germ
even
when
she
wakes
of
most
poisonous
worm
though

wounded

thy

a
praise
so
sweet

that
thou
in
the
tempest
of
things
as
a
rock
for
a
refuge
shouldst
stand
in
the
bloodred
river
of
tears
poured
forth

thou
said

of
the
watchwords
of

no

evermore
in

plumed

i

faint
not
all

through
for
sake
that
was

on
you
to

to
you
as

moist
reddened
air
that
sounds

smells
of
death
and
hath
no
light
but
upon
its
path
seen
through
the
black
tangled
hair
i
send
you
past
the
wild
wrath
to
find
his
face
who
bade
you
bear
fruit
of
his
seed
to
faith
and
love
that
he
may
take
the
heart
thereof
by
day
or
night
by
sea
or
street
fly
till
ye
find
and
clasp
his
feet
and
kiss
as
worshippers
who
bring
too
much
love
on
their
lips
to
sing
but
with
hushed
heads
accept
and
greet
the
presence
of
some
heavenlier
thing
in
the
near
air
so
may
ye
meet
his
eyes
and
droop
not
utterly
for
sake
at
the
light
you
see
not
utterly
struck
spiritless
for
sake
and
unworthiness
of
these
poor
forceless
hands
that
come
empty
these
lips
that
should
be
dumb
this
love
whose
seal
can
but
impress
these
weak
wearisome
whose
blessings
have
not
strength
to
bless
nor
lightnings
fire
to
burn
up
aught
nor
smite
with
thunders
of
their
thought
one
thought
they
have
even
love
one
light
truth
that
keeps
clear
the
sun
by
night
one
chord
of
faith
as
of
a
lyre
one
heat
of
hope
as
of
a
fire
one
heart
one
music
and
one
might
one
flame
one
altar
and
one
choir
and
one
living
head
in
sight
who
said
when
all
sea
was
foam
there
be
there
was
rome
as
a
star
set
in
space
for
token
like
a
live
word
of
mouth
spoken
visible
sound
light
audible
in
the
great
darkness
thick
as
hell
a
stanchless
flame
of
love
unsloken
a
sign
to
conquer
and
compel
a
law
to
stand
in
heaven
unbroken
whereby
the
sun
shines
and
wherethrough
eldest
empires
are
made
new
so
rose
up
on
our
generations
that
light
of
the
most
ancient
nations
law
life
and
light
on
the
way
the
very
god
of
very
day
the
from
their
stations
far
down
the
night
in
disarray
fled
crowned
with
fires
of
tribulations
the
suns
of
sunless
years
whose
light
and
life
and
law
were
of
the
night
the
naked
kingdoms
quenched
and
stark
drave
with
their
dead
things
down
the
dark
helmless
their
whole
world
throne
by
throne
fell
and
its
whole
heart
turned
to
stone
hopeless
their
hands
that
touched
our
ark
withered
and
lo
aloft
alone
on
white
waters
one
bark
where
the
red
open
eye
lit
the
soft
gulf
of
low
green
sky
so
for
a
season
piloted
it
sailed
the
sunlight
and
struck
red
with
fire
of
dawn
reverberate
the
wan
face
of
incumbent
fate
that
paused
half
pitying
overhead
and
almost
had
foregone
the
freight
of
those
dark
hours
the
next
day
bred
for
shame
and
almost
had
forsworn
service
of
night
for
love
of
morn
then
broke
the
whole
night
in
one
blow
thundering
then
all
hell
with
one
throe
heaved
and
brought
forth
beneath
the
stroke
death
and
all
dead
things
moved
and
woke
that
the
arrows
had
brought
low
at
the
great
sound
of
night
that
broke
thundering
and
all
the
old
woe
and
under
dome
men
sought
her
and
she
was
not
rome
still
with
blind
hands
and
robes
night
hangs
on
heaven
reluctant
yet
with
black
blood
dripping
from
her
eyes
on
the
soiled
lintels
of
the
skies
with
brows
and
lips
that
thirst
and
threat
with
fear
lest
the
sun
rise
and
aching
with
her
fires
that
set
and
shuddering
ere
dawn
bursts
her
bars
burns
out
with
all
her
beaten
stars
in
this
black
wind
of
war
they
fly
now
ere
that
hour
be
in
the
sky
that
brings
back
hope
and
memory
back
and
light
and
law
to
lands
that
lack
that
spiritual
sweet
hour
whereby
the
night
and
black
shall
be
cast
out
of
heaven
to
die
kingdom
by
kingdom
crown
by
crown
the
fires
of
darkness
are
blown
down
yet
heavy
grievous
yet
the
weight
sits
on
us
of
imperfect
fate
from
wounds
of
other
days
and
deeds

this
breathing
body
bleeds
still
kings
for
fear
and
slaves
for
hate
sow
lives
of
men
on
earth
like
seeds
in
the
red
soil
they
saturate
and
we
with
faces
eastward
set
stand
sightless
of
the
morning
yet
and
many
for
pure
sake
look
back
and
stretch
back
hands
to
take
gifts
of
giving
ease
and
sleep
flowers
of
grafting
strong
to
steep
the
soul
in
dreams
it
will
not
break
songs
of
soft
hours
that
sigh
and
sweep
its
lifted
eyelids
nigh
to
wake
with
subtle
plumes
and
lulling
breath
that
soothe
its
weariness
to
death
and
many
called
of
hope
and
pride
fall
ere
the
sunrise
from
our
side
fresh
lights
and
rumours
of
fresh
fames
that
shift
and
veer
by
night
like
flames
shouts
and
blown
trumpets
ghosts
that
glide
calling
and
hail
them
by
dead
names
fears
angers

dreams
divide
spirit

and
wear
out
strong
hearts
of
men
with
hope
and
doubt
till

beget
and
sorrow
bear
the
eyeless
child
despair
that
comes
among
us
mad
and
blind
with
counsels
of
a
broken
mind
tales
of
times
dead
and
woes
that
were
and
prophesying
against
mankind
shakes
out
the
horror
of
her
hair

take
the
sunlight
with
its
coils
and
hold
the
living
soul
in

by
many
ways
of
death

servitudes
their

that
men
there
are
who
see
and
hear
things
other
far
than
we
by
the
light
sitting
on
their
brows
the
fire
wherewith
their
presence
glows
the
music
falling
with
their
feet
the
sweet
sense
of
a
spirit
sweet
that
with
their
speech
or
motion
grows
and
breathes
and
burns
hearts
with
heat
by
these
signs
there
is
none
but
knows
men
who
have
life
and
grace
to
give
men
who
have
seen
the
soul
and
live
by
the
strength
sleeping
in
their
eyes
the
lips
whereon
their
sorrow
lies
smiling
the
lines
of
tears
unshed
the
large
divine
look
of
one
dead
that
speaks
out
of
the
breathless
skies
in
silence
when
the
light
is
shed
upon
soul
of
memories
the
supreme
look
that
sets
love
free
the
look
of
stars
and
of
the
sea
by
the
strong
patient
godhead
seen
implicit
in
their
mortal
mien
the
conscience
of
a
god
held
still
and
thunders
ruled
by
their
own
will
and
fires
that
might
burn
clean
this
worldly
air
that
foul
things
fill
and
the
afterglow
of
what
has
been
that
passing
shows
us
without
word
what
they
have
seen
what
they
have
heard
by
all
these
keen
and
burning
signs
the
spirit
knows
them
and
divines
in
bonds
in
banishment
in
grief
scoffed
at
and
scourged
with
unbelief
foiled
with
false
trusts
and
thwart
designs
stripped
of
green
days
and
hopes
in
leaf
their
mere
bare
body
of
glory
shines
higher
and
man
gazing
surelier
sees
what
light
what
comfort
is
of
these
so
i
now
gazing
till
the
sense
being
set
on
fire
of
confidence
strains
itself
sunward
feels
out
far
beyond
the
bright
and
morning
star
beyond
the
extreme
refluence
to
where
the
fierce
first
sunbeams
are
whose
fire
intolerant
and
intense
as
birthpangs
whence
day
burns
to
be
parts
breathless
heaven
from

i

that
thou

and

at
whose
hand
the
first
days
and
the
last
days
stand
with
scars
and
crowns
on
head
and
breast
that
fought
for
love
of
the
sweet
land
or
shall
fight
in
her
latter
quest
all
the
days
armed
and
girt
and
crowned
whose
glories
ring
thy
glory
round
thou
sawest
when
all
the
world
was
blind
the
light
that
should
be
of
mankind
the
very
day
that
was
to
be
and
how
shalt
thou
not
sometime
see
thy
city
perfect
to
thy
mind
stand
face
to
living
face
with
thee
and
no
miscrowned
head
behind
the
hearth
of
man
the
human
home
the
central
flame
that
shall
be
rome
as
one
that
ere

makes

the

rims

waves
whence
day

peer
well
above

love

swimming
with

feels
the
full
flower
of
morning
shed
and
fluent
sunrise
round
him
rolled
that
laps
and
laves
his
body
bold
with
fluctuant
heaven
in
stead
and
urgent
through
the
growing
gold
strikes
and
sees
all
the
spray
flash
red
and
his
soul
takes
the
sun
and
yearns
for
joy
wherewith
the
heart
burns
so
the
soul
seeking
through
the
dark
heavenward
a
dove
without
an
ark
transcends
the
unnavigable
sea
of
years
that
wear
out
memory
so
calls
a
lark
in
the
ear
of
souls
that
should
be
free
so

them
toward
the
sun
for

who
steer
not
for
the
stress
of
waves
and
seek
strange
helmsmen
and
are
slaves
for
if
the
eastward
eye
must
see
no
put
by
the
hope
that
lifted
him
and
led
once
to
have
light
about
his
head
to
see
beneath
the
clear
low
sky
the
green
wave
wax
red
and
all
the

then
as
helpless
hopes
go
down
let
self
in
the
dark
tides
drown

if
no
morning
must
behold
man
other
than
were

now
cold
and
other

than
past
deeds
done
nor

the

life
the

the
greatness

spirit

of
heroism
which
distinguished
this
daughter
of

people
and
should

her
name
fresh
above
the
holy
horde
of
saints
in

records

but
there
is
no

significance
in
the
story
which
tells
how
she
succeeded
in
humanizing
a
criminal
under
sentence
of
death
and
given
over
by
the
priests
as
a
soul
doomed
and
desperate
how
the
man
thus
raised
and
melted
out
of
his
fierce
and
brutal
despair
besought
her
to
sustain
him
to
the
last
by
her
presence
how
having
accompanied
him
with
comfort
and
support
to
the
very
scaffold
and
seen
his
head
fall
she
took
it
up
and
turning
to
the
spectators
who
stood
doubtful
whether
the
poor
wretch
could
be
kissed
it
in
sign
of
her
faith
that
his
sins
were
forgiven
him
the
high
and
fixed
passion
of
her
heroic
temperament
gives
her
a
right

remembrance
and
honour
of
which
the
have
done
their
best
to
deprive
her
cleared
of
all
the

rubbish
of

her
life
would
deserve
a
chronicler
who
should
do
justice
at
once
to
the
ardour
of
her
religious
imagination
and
to
a
thing
far
rarer
and
more
strength
and
breadth
of
patriotic
thought
and
devotion
which
sent
this
girl
across
the
alps
to
seek
the
living
symbol
of
italian
hope
and
unity
and
bring
it
back
by
force
of
simple
appeal
in
the
name
of
god
and
of
the
country
by
the
light
of
those
solid
and
actual
qualities
which
ensure
to
her
no
ignoble
place
on
the
noble
roll
of
italian
women
who
have
deserved

record

her
visions
