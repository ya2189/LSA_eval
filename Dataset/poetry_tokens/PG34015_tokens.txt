preface
one
who
after
writing
prose
all
his
life
suddenly
essays
to
launch
a
volume
of
verse
must
know
something
of
the
feeling
with
which
an
sailor
after
coasting
only
his
native
shores
found
himself
setting
sail
into
an
unknown
sea
the
author
of
this
little
volume
knows
quite
as
well
as
the
most
experienced
mariner
the
temerity
of
sailing
an
untried
main
in
so
frail
a
bark
but
he
is
willing
if
the
fates
so
decree
to
go
down
with
the
unnumbered
sail
of
that
great
fleet
which
have
throughout
the
ages
faced
the
wide
ocean
of
oblivion
merely
for
the
thrill
of
being
for
a
brief
space
on
its
vast
waters
since
horace
secure
in
the
double
endowment
of
genius
and
of
an
emperor
favor
wrote
scornfully
how
hated
of
gods
and
men
was
middling
verse
no
one
has
ever
doubted
the
fact
perhaps
not
even
one
of
all
the
myriads
who
have
dared
to
brave
that
bitter
scorn
the
explanation
then
for
the
production
of
so
much
of
the
despised
matter
must
be
that
there
is
for
the
minor
poet
also
a
music
that
the
outer
world
does
not
catch
an
inner
day
which
the
outer
world
does
not
see
it
is
this
music
this
light
which
for
the
most
part
is
for
the
lesser
poet
his
only
reward
that
he
has
heard
however
brokenly
and
at
however
vast
a
distance
snatches
of
those
strains
which
thrilled
the
souls
of
marlowe
and
milton
and
keats
and
shelley
even
though
he
may
never
reproduce
one
of
them
is
moreover
a
sufficiently
high
reward

dedication
to
as
one
who
wanders
in
a
lonely
land
through
all
the
blackness
of
a
stormy
night
now
stumbling
here
now
falling
there
outright
and
doubts
if
it
be
worse
to
stir
or
stand
not
knowing
what
abysses
yawn
at
hand
what
torrents
roar
beyond
some
beetling
height
yet
scales
the
top
to
find
the
dawn
in
sight
and
earth
kissed
into
radiance
with
its
wand
so
wandering
hopeless
in
the
darkness
i
scarce
recking
whither
led
my
painful
way
or
whether
i
should
faint
or
strive
to
prove
if
the
some
path
might
lie
climbed
boldly
up
the
steep
and
lo
the
day
broke
into
pearl
and
splendor
in
thy
love
the
coast
of
bohemia
there
is
a
land
not
charted
on
all
charts
though
many
mariners
have
touched
its
coast
who
far
adventuring
in
those
distant
parts
meet
there
and
are
forever
lost
or
if
they
return
are
soon
once
more
borne
far
away
by
hunger
for
that
magic
shore
its
mystic
mountains
on
the
horizon
piled
some
mariners
have
glimpsed
when
driven
far
out
of
life
measured
course
by
tempests
wild
or
lured
therefrom
by
the
erratic
star
they
chose
as
pilot
till
their
errant
guide
drew
them
resistlessly
within
its
witching
tide
for
oft
they
tell
who
know
its
sapphire
strand
the
golden
haze
enfolding
it
hangs
low
and
those
who
careless
steer
may
miss
the
land
embosomed
in
the
sunset
purple
glow
its
lights
mistaken
for
the
evening
stars
its
music
for
the
on
its
golden
bars
young
jason
found
it
when
he
dauntless
sought
the
golden
fleece
by
colchis
perilous
stream
and
in
his
track
full
many
an
argonaut
hath
found
the
rare
fleece
of
his
golden
dream
and
at
the
last
surcease
from
sorrow
dole
and
labor
heavy
prease
one
voyager
charted
it
for
every
age
from
azure
rim
to
starry
mountain
core
a
nameless
player
on
the
world
great
stage
he
spread
his
sails
adventured
to
that
shore
and
reared
a
pharos
with
his
art
sublime
like
ilion
towers
to
beacon
every
clime
the
great
adventurers
reached
it
when
they
brake
into
the
unknown
west
and
those
who
followed
in
their
shining
wake
but
left
no
trace
of
where
their
keels
have
pressed
yet
have
through
stress
of
storm
and
tempests
rage
won
by
his
quenchless
light
a
happy
anchorage
there
rest
the
heroes
of
lost
causes
lorn
on
their
calm
brows
more
fadeless
chaplets
far
than
all
their
conquerors
could
adorn
when
shone
effulgent
fame
ascendant
star
there
fallen
patriots
reap
the
glorious
prize
of
deathless
memory
of
their
precious
sacrifice
there
many
a
maid
and
matron
dwells
from
argive
helen
on
through
gliding
time
there
drink
the
poets
draughts
from
crystal
wells
and
choir
high
music
to
their
harps
sublime
and
there
the
great
philosophers
discourse
divine
philosophy
in
due
and
tranquil
course
there
not
alone
the
great
and
lofty
sing
but
silent
poets
too
find
there
the
song
they
only
sang
in
dreams
when
wandering
amazed
and
lost
amid
the
earthly
throng
their
hearts
unfettered
all
from
worldly
fears
attuned
to
meet
the
spacious
music
of
the
spheres
gray
wrinkled
men
the
in
their
hair
their
eyes
set
deep
with
peering
through
the
gloom
their
voices
low
with
speaking
ever
where
the
surges
break
beneath
the
mountains
loom
but
deep
within
their
yearning
burning
eyes
the
light
reflected
ever
from
those
radiant
skies
there
fadeless
youth
unknowing
of
annoy
walks
aye
with
changeless
love
and
sorrow
there
is
but
a
memory
to
hallow
joy
with
chastened
happiness
so
deep
and
rare
the
heart
aches
with
its
rich
content
and
hope
with
full
fruition
evermore
is
blent
constant
penelope
her
web
complete
rests
there
content
at
last
and
smiling
down
on
worn
ulysses
basking
at
her
feet
calm
beatrice
wears
joyously
the
crown
bestowed
by
exiled
dante
in
his
grief
and
laura
kind
gives
petrarch
tuneful
heart
relief
bloomy
meadows
laved
by
limpid
streams
repose
the
muses
and
the
graces
sweet
there
kiss
we
lips
we
only
kissed
in
dreams
meshed
in
the
grosser
world
and
there
we
meet
the
fair
and
lost
loves
of
our
youth
when
unafraid
we
trod
the
ways
with
radiant
truth
those
who
return
have
pressed
alone
the
coast
but
tell
of
some
lost
in
that
charmèd
strond
aspiring
souls
who
loving
honor
most
have
sought
the
crystal
beyond
and
striven
upward
heedless
of
their
scars
to
where
all
paths
lead
ever
to
the
shining
stars
the
voice
of
the
sea
thus
spake
to
man
the
sea
words
which
the
stealing
winds
caught
from
its
lips
thou
thinkest
thee
and
thine
god
topmost
crown
but
hearken
unto
me
and
humbly
learn
how
infinite
thine
insignificance
thou
boastest
of
thine
age
thy
works
thyself
thine
oldest
monuments
of
which
thou
were
built
but
yesterday
when
measured
by
yon
mountains
of
eternal
rock
the
earth
thy
mother
from
whose
breast
thou
the
living
which
she
wills
to
give
and
in
whose
dust
thine
own
must
melt
again
was
agèd
cycles
ere
thine
earliest
dawn
but
they
to
me
are
young
i
gave
them
birth
climb
up
those
peaks
thy
dizziest
height
thou
there
shalt
read
graved
deep
my
name
and
age
dig
down
thy
deepest
depth
shalt
read
them
still
before
the
mountains
sprang
before
the
earth
thy
cradle
and
thy
tomb
was
made
i
was
god
called
them
forth
from
me
as
thee
from
earth
thou
through
a
mountain
here
and
there
all
thine
engines
cutting
off
a
speck
i
wash
their
under
tear
turret
from
turret
toppling
thundering
down
and
crush
their
mightiest
fragments
into
sand
thou
gravest
with
thy
records
slab
and
spar
and
callest
them
memorials
of
thy
might
lo
not
a
stone
exists
from
yon
black
cliff
to
that
small
pebble
at
thy
foot
but
bears
my
signature
graved
there
when
earth
was
young
to
teach
the
mighty
wonders
of
the
deep
thy
deeds
thyself
are
what
a
morning
mist
but
i
i
face
the
ages
dost
not
know
that
as
i
gave
the
earth
to
spread
her
fair
and
body
in
the
morning
light
so
still
is
i
that
keep
her
fair
and
fresh
that
weave
her
robes
and
nightly
diamond
them
i
fill
her
odorous
bowers
with
perfumes
rare
strew
field
and
forest
with
stars
i
give
the
morn
pearl
for
her
radiant
roof
and
eve
lend
glory
for
her
rosy
dome
i
build
the
purple
towers
that
hold
the
west
and
guard
the
passage
of
retiring
day
thy
frailest
fabric
far
outlasts
thyself
the
pyramids
rise
from
the
desert
sands
their
builders
blown
in
dust
about
their
feet
the
winged
bull
looms
mid
an
alien
race
grim
silent
lone
but
whither
went
the
king
i
cool
the
lambent
air
upon
my
breast
and
send
the
winds
forth
on
mine
embassies
i
offer
all
my
body
to
the
sun
and
lade
our
caravans
with
merchandise
to
carry
wealth
and
plenty
to
all
climes
yon
fleecy
continents
of
floating
snow
that
dwarf
the
mountains
over
which
they
sail
are
but
my
bales
borne
by
my
messengers
to
cheer
and
gladden
every
thirsty
land
the
arab
by
his
desert
pool
the
laplander
above
his
frozen
rill
the
woodsman
crouched
beside
his
forest
brook
the
shepherd
mirrored
in
his
upland
spring
drink
of
my
cup
in
one
great
brotherhood
is
nay
not
man
alone
thou
art
but
one
of
all
the
myriads
of
things
brute
beast
bird
reptile
insect
thing
unnamed
whose
souls
find
recreation
in
my
breath
nay
not
a
tree
flower
sprig
of
grass
or
weed
but
lives
through
me
and
hymns
my
praise
to
god
i
feed
sustain
refresh
and
keep
them
all
mirror
and
type
of
god
that
giveth
life
i
sing
as
softly
as
a
mother
croons
her
drowsy
babe
to
sleep
upon
her
breast
on
quiet
nights
when
all
my
winds
are
laid
i
wile
the
stars
down
from
their
azure
home
to
sink
with
golden
footprints
in
my
depths
i
show
the
silvered
pathway
to
the
moon
all
paved
with
gems
the
errant
pleiad
lost
that
night
she
strayed
from
her
sisters
wan
but
i
sing
other
times
strains
from
that
song
before
whose
awfulness
my
waters
sank
and
at
whose
harmony
the
mountains
rose
i
heard
that
morning
when
the
breath
of
god
moved
on
my
face
and
said
let
there
be
light
i
thrill
and
tremble
since
but
at
the
thought
of
that
great
wonder
of
that
greatest
dawn
when
at
god
word
the
brooding
darkness
rose
which
veiled
my
face
from
all
the
birth
of
things
and
rolled
far
frighted
from
its
to
bide
henceforth
beyond
day
crystal
walls
while
all
the
morning
stars
together
sang
and
on
the
instant
god
stood
full
revealed
long
roll
at
napoleon
tomb
was
the
marble
crypt
where
the
emperor
lay
his
mighty
marshals
on
either
side
guarding
his
couch
since
the
solemn
day
france
brought
him
home
in
her
chastened
pride
to
sleep
on
her
heart
from
the
cage
where
the
eagle
pined
and
died
in
his
rage
i
thought
of
the
long
red
carnival
death
held
in
the
track
of
his
sword
amain
from
toulon
bloom
to
the
crimsoned
pall
he
spread
upon
waterloo
ripened
grain
i
thought
of
the
long
black
years
of
dread
when
the
nations
quaked
at
his
armies
tread
above
as
the
twilight
fell
the
deathly
silence
around
was
shocked
by
the
roll
of
a
drum
at
the
throbbing
swell
the
vaulted
dome
of
the
heavens
rocked
till
it
seemed
that
the
mighty
conqueror
soul
was
shaking
the
earth
in
that
drum
long
roll
in
the
purple
glooming
the
spell
was
wrought
and
forth
from
their
tomb
the
legions
sprang
a
of
a
master
thought
the
beat
and
the
bugles
sang
the
tattered
standards
again
unfurled
and
napoleon
once
more
bestrid
the
world
i
heard
that
instant
the
drum
which
beat
at
his
call
when
france
arose
from
her
ashes
and
blood
when
he
bade
her
come
in
liberty
name
to
face
her
foes
i
saw
her
invincible
armies
arise
the
light
of
liberty
in
their
eyes
tyranny
pyre
her
standards
flew
i
felt
the
thrill
of
the
life
as
cleansed
from
terror
france
the
true
sprang
forth
rejoicing
amid
the
strife
as
a
woman
rejoiceth
at
the
living
voice
of
her
own
from
the
ruddy
morning
on
egypt
sands
when
her
eagles
rose
in
their
terrible
flight
to
stretch
their
shadow
across
the
lands
till
it
perished
in
russia
frozen
night
when
th
insatiable
conqueror
reckoning
came
and
his
empire
melted
away
in
flame
when
there
at
moscow
the
lord
god
spoke
and
said
thine
end
is
at
hand
prepare
as
at
kadesh
once
from
amid
the
smoke
to
the
prophet
who
led
his
people
there
i
set
thee
up
i
will
cast
thee
down
for
that
thou
claimedst
thyself
the
crown
thine
eyes
have
seen
but
thou
shalt
not
stand
on
the
promised
shore
of
a
world
set
free
the
people
shall
pass
alone
to
the
land
of
promise
and
light
and
liberty
of
peace
enthroned
in
a
nation
trust
when
thou
and
thy
throne
alike
are
dust
the
princess
progress
across
the
dusky
land
the
gracious
goddess
spring
in
vernal
robes
arrayed
last
night
her
royal
progress
made
scattering
with
lavish
hand
her
fragrant
blossoming
along
the
wold
in
spendthrift
glee
she
strewed
her
gold
and
gilded
all
the
lea
the
dandelions
yellow
coin
lie
scattered
in
the
tangled
grass
and
buttercup
and
crocus
join
to
tell
the
way
she
chose
to
pass
in
lavish
wealth
the
gleaming
daffodil
shines
on
the
cloudy
april
hill
and
many
a
yellow
marigold
marks
where
her
brazen
chariot
rolled
the
narcissus
bends
his
dewy
head
and
leaning
down
looks
deep
to
find
within
a
lens
a
mirrowing
pool
where
love
may
drown
no
cranny
deep
nor
nook
but
felt
her
tender
look
no
secret
leafy
place
but
warmed
before
her
face
and
blossomed
with
her
grace
the
woodland
sombre
yesterday
hath
in
her
presence
donned
a
brave
array
and
in
a
night
grown
gay
her
purple
cloak
all
careless
flung
upon
the
hung
and
on
the
forest
trees
her
richest
laceries
while
sprinkled
deep
with
dust
of
gold
the
tender
flowery
branches
hold
her
verdant
robe
blown
fold
on
fold
her
queenly
figure
clad
in
broidered
raiment
glad
complete
and
passing
sweet
hath
set
the
sylvan
zephyrs
mad
about
her
breathed
rare
odors
sweet
of
roses
blowing
neath
her
feet
about
her
breathed
sweet
odors
rare
of
violets
shaken
from
her
hair
as
though
unseen
of
mortal
eyes
she
jarred
the
gates
of
paradise
her
crystal
horn
in
passing
by
she
wound
and
at
the
witching
sound
as
by
the
enchanter
stroke
the
fields
in
music
broke
and
every
silent
grove
in
melody
awoke
responsive
to
her
charmèd
lyre
the
choir
carol
in
every
brake
and
brier
and
flood
with
golden
song
the
verdant
reaches
ranged
along
where
drinking
deep
from
fountains
clear
their
inspiration
they
hymn
their
jubilation
that
spring
again
is
here
and
all
together
sing
the
goddess
of
the
year

once
might
hear
the
fairies
sing
upon
the
feathery
grass
or
in
the
orchard
blossoming
their
melody
so
fine
and
clear
one
had
to
bend
his
ear
to
hear
or
else
the
music
well
might
pass
for
zephyrs
whispering
in
the
grass
i
once
might
see
the
fairies
dance
in
their
by
the
glance
their
airy
feet
in
crystal
shoon
made
twinklings
neath
the
silver

such
witchery

that

have
been

where
music
dwells
mid

thy
true
lover

now
exalted
elate
as
an
heir
who
returns
to
recover
his
forefathers
lofty
estate
i
seen
visions
of
castle
and
palace
to
skies
where
men
have
drunk
deep
of
death
chalice
in
infinite
where
tyranny
glutted
her
malice
and
battened
on
liberty
cries
where
splendor
of
palace
and
tower
cried
up
unto
god
with
men
blood
where
th
emblems
of
tyranny
power
imperial
and
brazen
have
stood
with

and
sword
to
devour
and
the

scowling
hard
by

and
now
at
thy
fair
open
portal
i
stand
as
i
stood
in
my
youth
amazed
at
the
vision
immortal
of
naked
and
unashamed
truth
the
truth
that
the
fathers
have
taught
all
their
children
their
in

i
greet
thee
thy
purple
large
reaches
from
the
pine
to
thy
golden
long
beaches
awash
with
thy
tropical
brine
and
thine
infinite
bosom
that
teaches
how
god
hath
made
freedom
divine
god
dowered
thee
fair
mid
the
oceans
he
bulwarked
thee
strong
with
the
seas
that
man
might
preserve
here
the
motions
he
gave
freedom
bold
processes
that
man
in
his
loftiest
devotions
might
serve
freedom
altars
in
peace
how
crude
then
and
rude
then
soever
thy
struggles
to
lift
from
the
sod
thy
freedom
is
strong
to
dissever
the
shackles
the
yoke
and
the
rod
thy
freedom
is
mighty
forever
for
men
who
kneel
only
to
god
dawn
who
hath
not
heard
in
dusky
summer
dawns
ere
winds
aurora
horn
the
dreamy
spell
just
rippled
by
some
drowsy
sentinel
who
from
his
leafy
outpost
on
the
lawns
chimes
sleepily
his
call
that
all
is
well
a
moment
pipes
another
silvery
note
aurora
crystal
wheels
flash
up
the
sky
the
sentries
cry
the
dawn
and
joyously
glad
welcome
peals
from
every
dewy
throat
and
every
leafy
bough
chimes
melody
so
in
the
gloom
and
silence
of
the
night
my
heart
in
slumber
steeped
unheeding
lay
not
recking
how
the
hours
might
fleet
away
when
on
my
heavens
dawned
a
radiant
light
and
straight
i
wakened
to
a
shining
day
the
poet
on
agradina
the
spacious
cities
hummed
with
toil
the
monarch
reared
his
towers
to
the
skies
men
delved
the
fruitful
soil
and
studied
to
be
wise
along
the
highway
rocky
coil
the
mailed
legions
rang
smiling
unheeded
the
moil
the
poet
sang
the
glittering
cities
long
are
heaps
the
starry
towers
lie
level
with
the
plain
the
desert
serpent
sleeps
where
soared
the
marble
fane
the
stealthy
lizard
creeps
where
gleamed
the
tyrant
throne
the
grandeur
dark
oblivion
steeps
the
song
sings
on
the
shepherd
of
the
seas
from
raleigh
devon
hills
the
misty
sea
climbs
ever
westward
till
it
meets
the
sky
and
silently
the
ships
go
by
and
mount
and
mount
up
the
long
azure
lea
peaceful
as
sheep
at
night
that
placidly
climb
the
tall
downs
to
quiet
pastures
high
assured
no
foes
dare
lurk
no
dangers
lie
where
still
abides
their
shepherd
memory
well
did
men
name
him
shepherd
of
the
seas
who
knew
so
well
his
shepherd
watch
to
keep
driving
the
spanish
wolves
with
noble
rage
forsaking
pomp
and
power
and
to
herd
his
mighty
flock
through
every
deep
and
make
of
every
sea
their
common
pasturage
sleep
in
memoriam
a
thou

to
a
lady
at
a
spring
long
æons
since
in
leafy
woodlands
sweet
diana
weary
with
the
eager
chase
was
wont
to
seek
full
oft
some
loved
of
her
rosy
train
some
cool
retreat
of
crystal
springs
from
the
heat
of
sultry
noon
wherein
each
subtle
grace
of
snowy
form
and
radiant
goddess
and
nymph
might
greet
diana
long
hath
fleeted
the
main
the
founts
which
erst
she
loved
are
all
bereft
no
more
her
feet
are
set
silent
her
silvern
bugle
fled
her
train
one
spot
alone
of
all
she
loved
is
left
this
spring
is
yet
unforgotten
oh
do
not
think
that
thee
i
can
forget
though
all
the
centuries
should
me
roll
though
space
should
spread
more
far
than
pole
from
pole
or

from

betwixt

yet
i
still
would
hold
thee
in
my

set
more
rare
than
rarest
queens
whom
kings
extol
when
death
hath
throned
them
high
above

through
endless

when
memory
the
stone
rolls
back
from
silent
years
long
sepulchred
to
call
the
past
forth
from
the
sullen
tomb
far
her

thou

in

she
come
to

the
dragon
dead
has
waked
to
life
again
it
is
related
that
king
philip
one
day
invited
a
lady
to
sail
with
him
on
a
lake
and
she
replied
that
she
was
afraid
they
might
meet
the
dragon
the
bent
monk
ever
along
the
way
he
goes
with
eyes
cast
down
as
in
despair
and
shoulders
stooped
with
weight
of
woes
and
lips
from
which
unceasing
flows
an
agonizèd
prayer
his
form
is
bent
his
step
is
slow
his
hands
with
fasting
long
are
thin
and
his
footsteps
go
men
hear
his
muttered
prayer
and
know
he
weeps
for
deadly
sin
this
monk
was
once
the
knightliest
of
knights
who
ever
sat
in
hall
with
wondrous
might
and
beauty
blest
and
whoso
met
him
had
need
on
christ
to
call
men
say
this
monk
with
hair
so
hoar
and
eye
where
grief
hath
quenched
the
flame
once
loved
a
maiden
fair
and
pure
and
for
she
would
not
wed
him
swore
he
bring
her
down
to
shame
they
say
he
wooed
her
long
and
well
and
splendid
spoils
both
eve
and
morn
of
song
and
tourney
won
they
tell
he
gave
her
till
at
last
she
fell
then
drave
her
forth
with
scorn
the
world
was
cold
her
father
door
was
barred
they
thus
the
tale
repeat
her
name
was
heard
in
jousts
no
more
and
so
one
day
the
river
bore
and
laid
her
at
his
feet
her
brow
was
calm
the
sunny
hair
lay
tangled
in
the
snowy
breast
and
from
the
face
all
trace
of
care
and
sin
was
cleansed
away
and
there
shone
only
utter
rest
the
old
men
say
that
when
the
wave
that
burden
brought
then
backward
fled
he
stooped
no
sign
nor
groan
he
gave
as
mourners
by
an
open
grave
but
fell
as
one
struck
dead
he
seemed
when
from
that
swound
he
woke
a
man
already
touched
by
death
as
when
the
stalwart
forest
oak
blasted
beneath
the
lightning
stroke
lives
on
yet
languisheth
and
ever
since
he
tells
his
beads
and
sackcloth
lieth
next
his
skin
and
nightly
his
frail
body
bleeds
with
knotted
cord
that
intercedes
with
christ
for
deadly
sin
for
his
own
soul
he
hath
no
care
by
penance
purged
as
if
by
flame
men
know
that
agonized
prayer
he
prays
is
for
the
maiden
fair
whom
he
brought
down
to
shame
and
still
along
the
way
he
goes
with
eyes
cast
down
as
in
despair
and
shoulders
stooped
with
weight
of
woes
and
lips
from
which
forever
flows
an
agonizèd
prayer
the
message
an
ancient
tome
came
to
my
hands
a
tale
of
love
in
other
lands
writ
by
a
master
so
divine
the
love
seems
ever
mine
and
thine
the
volume
opened
at
the
place
that
sings
of
sweet
francesca
grace
how
reading
of
fair
guinevere
and
launcelot
that
long
gone
year
her
eyes
into
her
lover
fell
and
there
was
nothing
more
to
tell
that
day
they
that
book
no
more
thenceforth
they
read
a
deeper
lore
beneath
the
passage
so
divine
some
woman
hand
had
traced
a
line
and
reverently
upon
the
spot
had
laid
a
blue
a
message
sent
across
the
years
of
lovers
sighs
and
lovers
tears
a
messenger
left
there
to
tell
they
too
had
loved
each
other
well
the
centuries
had
glided
by
since
love
had
heaved
that
tender
sigh
the
tiny
spray
that
spoke
her
trust
had
like
herself
long
turned
to
dust
i
felt
a
sudden
sorrow
stir
my
heart
across
the
years
for
her
who
reading
how
francesca
loved
had
found
her
heart
so
deeply
moved
who
hearing
poor
francesca
moan
had
felt
her
sorrow
as
her
own
i
hope
where
e
her
grave
may
be
bloom
constantly
that
somewhere
in
yon
distant
skies
he
who
is
love
hath
heard
her
sighs
and
her
hath
granted
of
his
grace
ever
to
see
her
lover
face
the
needle
eye
they
bade
me
come
to
the
house
of
prayer
they
said
i
should
find
my
saviour
there
i
was
wicked
enough
god
wot
at
best
and
weary
enough
to
covet
rest
i
paused
at
th
door
with
a
timid
knock
the
people
within
were
a
silken
flock
by
their
scowls
of
pride
it
was
plain
to
see
salvation
was
not
for
the
likes
of
me
the
bishop
was
there
in
his
lace
and
lawn
and
the
cassocked
priest
i
saw
him
yawn
the
rich
and
great
and
virtuous
too
stood
smug
and
contented
each
in
his
pew
the
music
was
grand
the
service
fine
the
sermon
was
eloquent
nigh
divine
the
subject
was
pride
and
the
pharisee
and
the
publican
who
was
just
like
me
i
smote
my
breast
in
an
empty
pew
but
an
usher
came
and
looked
me
through
and
bade
me
stand
beside
the
door
in
the
space
reserved
for
the
mean
and
poor
i
left
the
church
in
my
rags
and
shame
in
the
dark
without
one
called
my
name
they
have
turned
me
out
as
well
quoth
he
take
thou
my
hand
and
come
fare
with
me
we
may
find
the
light
by
a
narrow
gate
the
way
is
steep
and
rough
and
strait
but
none
will
look
if
your
clothes
be
poor
when
you
come
at
last
to
my
father
door
i
struggled
on
where
he
led
the
blood
ran
down
from
his
hand
so
red
the
blood
ran
down
from
his
forehead
torn
is
naught
quoth
he
but
the
prick
of
a
thorn
you
bleed
i
cried
for
my
heart
quail
is
naught
is
naught
but
the
print
of
a
nail
you
limp
in
pain
and
your
feet
are
sore
yea
yea
quoth
he
for
the
nails
they
were
four
you
are
weary
and
faint
and
bent
i
cried
was
a
load
i
bore
up
a
mountain
side
the
way
is
steep
and
i
faint
but
he
it
was
steeper
far
upon
calvary
by
this
we
had
come
to
a
narrow
door
i
had
spied
afar
it
was
locked
before
but
now
in
the
presence
of
my
guide
the
postern
opened
wide
and
forth
there
streamed
a
radiance
more
bright
than
is
the
glance
and
harps
and
voices
greeted
him
the
music
of
the
seraphim
i
knew
his
face
where
the
light
did
fall
i
had
spat
in
it
in
herod
hall
i
knew
those
now
ah
me
i
had
helped
to
nail
him
to
a
tree
i
fainting
fell
before
his
face
imploring
pardon
of
his
grace
he
stooped
and
silencing
my
moan
he
bore
me
near
to
his
father
throne
he
wrapt
me
close
and
hid
my
shame
and
touched
my
heart
with
a
cleansing
flame
rest
here
said
he
while
i
go
and
try
to
widen
a
little
a
needle
eye
the
closed
door
lord
is
it
thou
who
knockest
at
my
door
i
made
it
fast
and
will
not
open
more
barred
it
so
tight
i
scarce
can
hear
thy
knock
and
am
too
feeble
now
to
turn
the
lock
clogged
with
my
folly
and

sunday
on

how
he
was

out
and
lazarus
taken
the
very
next
day
he
rejoiced
he
was
able
to
dine
that
evening
at
dives
table
while
wretched
lazarus
sick
and
poor
was
called
an
impostor
and
turned
from
the
door
the
question
why
may
i
not
step
from
this
empty
room
where
heavy
round
me
hangs
the
curtained
gloom
and
passing
through
a
little
darkness
there
even
as
one
climbs
to
bed
an
unlit
stair
find
that
i
know
is
but
one
step
above
and
that
i
hunger
for
my
life
my
love
is
but
a
curtain
doth
our
souls
divide
a
veil
my
eager
hand
might
tear
aside
one
step
to
take
one
thrill
one
throb
one
bound
and
i
have
gained
my
heaven
the
lost
have
found
have
solved
the
riddle
rare
the
secret
dread
the
vast
unfathomable
secret
of
the
dead
it
seems
but
now
that
as
i
yearning
stand
i
might
put
forth
my
hand
and
touch
her
hand
that
i
might
lift
my
longing
eyes
and
trace
but
for
the
darkness
there
the
gracious
face
that
could
i
hush
the
grosser
sounds
my
ear
the
charmèd
music
of
her
voice
might
hear
she
may
not
come
to
me
alas
i
know
else
had
she
surely
come
long
long
ago
the
conqueror
death
who
save
one
conquers
all
had
never
power
to
hold
that
soul
in
thrall
no
narrowest
no
piled
up
stone
had
held
her
heart
a
captive
from
my
own
no
is
not
these
hell
might
nor
heaven
charms
had
never
power
to
hold
her
from
my
arms
is
that
by
some
inscrutable
fixed
law
vaster
than
mortal
vision
ever
saw
whose
sweep
is
worlds
whose
track
eternity
somewhere
her
soul
angelic
waits
for
me
waits
patiently
his
wisdom
whose
decree
is
wisdom
self
veiled
in
infinity
who
gives
us
life
divine
with
mortal
breath
yet
in
its
pathway
lo
hath
planted
death
who
grants
us
love
our
dull
souls
to
uplift
nearer
to
him
yet
tears
away
his
gift
crowns
us
with
reason
in
his
image
made
yet
blinds
our
eyes
with
never
lifting
shade
who
may
the
mystery
solve
is
his
decree
can
mortal
understand
infinity
prostrate
thyself
before
his
feet
dull
clod
who
saith
be
still
and
know
that
i
am
god
ah
did
we
surely
know
the
joys
that
wait
beyond
the
portal
of
the
silent
gate
who
would
a
moment
longer
here
abide
the
spectre
sorrow
stalking
at
his
side
who
would
not
daring
take
the
leap
and
be
unbound
unfettered
clean
a
slave
set
free
our
dead
we
bury
our
dead
we
lay
them
to
sleep
with
the
earth
for
their
bed
with
stones
at
their
head
we
leave
them
and
weep
when
we
bury
our
dead
we
bury
our
dead
we
lay
them
to
sleep
on
our
mother
calm
breast
we
leave
them
to
rest
to
rest
while
we
weep
we
bury
our
dead
we
lay
them
to
sleep
they
reck
not
our
tears
though
the
sad
years
creep
through
our
tears
through
the
years
they
tranquilly
sleep
we
bury
our
dead
we
lay
them
to
sleep
we
bury
the
bloom
of
our
life
all
our
bloom
in
the
coffin
we
fold
we
enfold
in
the
tomb
we
reënter
the
room
we
left
young
we
are
old
we
bury
our
dead
we
lay
them
to
sleep
the
cold
flow
with
winter
and
spring
with
birds
on
the
wing
with
roses
and
snow
with
friends
who
beguile
our
sorrow
with
pity
with
pity
awhile
then
weary
and
smile
then
chide
us
say
lo
how
the
sun
shines
is
may
but
we
know
is
not
so
that
the
sun
died
that
day
when
we
laid
them
away
with
the
earth
for
a
bed
when
we
buried
our
dead
we
bury
our
dead
we
lay
them
to
sleep
we
turn
back
to
the
world
we
are
caught
we
are
whirled
in
the
rush
of
the
current
the
rush
and
the
sweep
of
the
tide
without
rest
but
they
sleep
they
the
blest
the
blessed
dead
sleep
they
tranquilly
rest
on
our
mother
calm
breast
my
mother
i
knew
her
in
her
prime
before
the
seal
of
time
was
graven
on
her
brow
as
age
hath
graved
it
now
when
radiant
youth
was
just
subdued
to
yield
to
gracious
womanhood
and
as
an
inland
lake
lies
tranquil
mid
the
hills
unruffled
by
the
storms
that
break
beyond
and
mirrors
heaven
so
to
her
spirit
freed
from
ills
a
blessed
calm
was
given
encircled
by
war
strife
peace
ruled
her
life
christ
teachings
were
her
constant
guide
and
naught
beside
christ
death
and
passion
were
her
plea
none
needed
she
for
that
amid
earth
fiercest
strife
her
life
was
patterned
on
his
life
now
when
her
eyes
grow
dim
she
lives
so
close
to
him
the
radiance
of
his
smile
envelops
her
the
while
as
when
the
prophet
figure
shone
with
light
reflected
from
the
throne
so
ever
in
her
face
shines
heaven
divinest
grace
her
soul
is
fresh
and
mild
as
is
a
little
child
and
as
the
fleshly
tenement
with
age
grows
worn
and
bent
her
spirit
unabated
youth
is
aye
to
me
the
truth
of
immortality
her
voice
is
as
it
were
a
silver
dulcimer
tuned
like
the
seraph
lays
eternally
to
praise
the
blessings
of
christ
chosen
friends
are
doubly
hers
whose
mind
to
charity
inclined
no
selfish
ends
have
ever
for
an
instant
moved
who
served
like
martha
and
like
mary
loved
her
influence
the
tender
earth
that
smiles
when
kissed
by
spring
the
flowers
the
budding
woods
the
birds
that
sing
the
summer
song
her
spirit
to
me
bring
the
meadows
cool
that
breathe
their
fragrant
myrrh
deep
placid
pools
that
little
breezes
blur
springs
speak
to
my
heart
of
her
heaven
purple
towers
upon
the
horizon
rim
the
dove
that
mourns
upon
his
lonely
limb
fill
my
soul
cup
with
memories
to
its
brim
in
evening
calm
when
in
the
quiet
skies
the
lustrous
silent
tender
stars
uprise
i
feel
the
holy
influence
of
her
eyes
that
deeper
hour
when
night
with
dawn
is
blent
and
silence
stirs
its
languors
spent
i
hear
her
gently
sigh
with
sweet
content
i
hear
young
children
laughing
in
the
street
catch
rays
of
sunshine
from
them
as
we
meet
and
smile
content
to
know
what
makes
them
sweet
yea
everywhere
in
every
righteous
strife
i
find
her
spirit
fragrant
influence
rife
like
mary
precious
spikenard
sweetening
life
matthew
arnold
he
challenged
all
that
came
within
his
ken
and
error
held
with
steadfast
mind
aloof
truth
itself
he
put
upon
the
proof
holding
that
light
was
god
first
gift
to
men
the
stranger
straying
one
day
amid
the
leafy
bowers
a
presence
passed
masked
in
a
sunny
ray
tossing
behind
him
carelessly
the
hours
as
one
shakes
blossoms
from
a
ravished
spray
strewing
them
far
and
wide
nor
glanced
to
either
side
as
he
strolled
he
chanced
upon
a
flower
which
full
within
his
pathway
blew
white
as
a
lily
modest
as
a
nun
sweeter
than
lilith
rose
in
eden
grew
her
beauty
he
espied
approached
and
softly
sighed
his
breath
the
blossom
stirred
and
all
the
air
grew
fragrant
with
a
subtle
rich
perfume
the
spicèd
alleys
glowed
the
while
a
rare
and
crystal
radiance
did
illume
all
the
adjacent
space
as
were
an
angel
face
kneeling
he
gently
laid
his
glowing
lips
like
softest
music
on
her
lips
when
came
a
thrill
that
trembled
to
her
and
on
the
instant
with
a
sudden
flame
leaped
forth
the
shining
sun
and
earth
and
heaven
were
one
who
art
thou
queried
she
tell
me
thy
name
to
whom
godlike
this
godlike
power
is
given
that
thus
for
me
without
or
fear
or
shame
but
by
thy
lips
soft
touch
greatest
heaven
whilst
to
his
heart
she
clove
he
whispered
i
am
love
love
after
anacreon
astray
within
a
garden
bright
i
found
a
tiny
wingèd
sprite
he
scarce
was
bigger
than
a
sparrow
and
bore
a
little
bow
and
arrow
i
lifted
him
up
in
my
arm
without
a
thought
of
guile
or
harm
but
merely
as
it
were
in
play
with
threats
to
carry
him
away
the
sport
he
took
in
such
ill
part
he
stuck
an
arrow
in
my
heart
and
ever
since
i
have
such
pain
i
can
not
draw
it
out
again
and
yet
the
strangest
part
is
this
i
love
the
pain
as
though
were
bliss
an
old
refrain
it
seems
to
me
as
i
think
of
her
that
my
youth
has
come
again
i
hear
the
breath
of
summer
stir
the
leaves
in
the
old
refrain
oh
my
oh
my
oh
where
can
my
lady
be
i
will
seek
my
love
with
the
wings
of
a
dove
and
pray
her
to
love
but
me
the
meadows
all
once
more
are
green
with
grass
and
plume
the
again
are
hoar
with
fragrant
snow
of
bloom
oh
my
oh
my
oh
where
can
my
lady
be
etc
the
slips
tinkling
by
with
silvery
rippling
flow
and
sing
on
fences
nigh
to
dandelions
below
oh
my
oh
my
oh
where
can
my
lady
be
etc
i
hear
again
the
drowsy
croon
of
bees
and
catch
the
rune
they
hum
to
locust
trees
oh
my
oh
my
oh
where
can
my
be
etc
far
off
the
cows
low
that
the
eve
is
late
and
call
their
calves
neath
to
meet
them
at
the
gate
oh
my
oh
my
oh
where
can
my
lady
be
etc
once
more
the
knights
and
ladies
pass
in
visions
i
lie
full
length
in
summer
grass
to
choose
my
own
oh
my
oh
my
oh
where
can
my
lady
be
etc
i
know
not
how
i

is
surpassing
fair
i

i
love
her
well
oh
my

as
pure
as
snow

true

i
love
her
so
she
must
love
me
in
sooth
oh
my
oh
my

where
can
my

i
know
the
stars
dim
to
her
eyes

flowers
blow
in
her
face

angels
in
the
skies

given
her
of
their
grace
oh

a
dove
and
pray
her
to
love
but
me
to
claudia
it
is
not
claudia
that
thine
eyes
are
sweeter
far
to
me
than
is
the
light
of
summer
skies
to
captives
just
set
free
it
is
not
that
the
setting
sun
is
tangled
in
thy
hair
and
recks
not
of
the
course
to
run
in
such
a
silken
snare
nor
for
the
music
of
thy
words
fair
claudia
love
i
thee
though
sweeter
than
the
songs
of
birds
that
melody
to
me
it
is
not
that
rich
roses
rare
within
thy
garden
grow
nor
that
the
fairest
lilies
are
less
snowy
than
thy
brow
nay
claudia
is
that
every
grace
in
thy
dear
self
i
find
that
heaven
itself
is
in
thy
face
and
also
in
thy
mind
the
at
even
ah
long
ago
it
seems
to
me
those
sweet
old
days
of
summer
when
i
was
young
and
fair
was
she
and
sorrow
only
rumor
and
all
the
world
was
less
than
naught
to
me
who
had
her
favor
for
time
and
care
had
not
then
taught
how
life
of
death
hath
savor
and
all
the
day
the
roving
bees
clung
to
the
swinging
clover
and
robins
in
the
answered
the
plover
and
all
the
sounds
were
low
and
sweet
the
zephyrs
left
off
roaming
in
curving
gambols
the
wheat
to
kiss
her
in
the
gloaming
the
kissed
her
hair
the
daisies
prayed
her
wreathe
them
ah
me
the
blossoms
still
are
there
but
she
lies
deep
beneath
them
i
now
have
turned
my
thoughts
to
god
earth
from
my
heart
i
sever
with
fast
and
prayer
i
onward
plod
with
prayer
and
fast
forever
yet
when
the
priest
speaks
low
and
bids
me
think
of
heaven
i
always
hear
the
breezes
blow
the
at
even
my
wealth
my
hath
no
wealth
they
say
but
when
they
do
i
tell
them
nay
for
she
hath
wealth
of
golden
hair
shot
through
with
shafts
from
delos
bow
that
shines
about
her
shoulders
rare
like
sunlight
on
new
driven
snow
my
hath
no
wealth
they
say
but
when
they
do
i
tell
them
nay
for
she
hath
eyes
so
soft
and
bright
so
deep
the
light
that
in
them
lies
that
stars
in
heaven
would
lose
their
light
ashine
beside
my
eyes
my
hath
no
wealth
they
say
but
when
they
do
i
tell
them
nay
for
oh
she
hath
such
dainty
hands
so
snowy
white
so
fine
and
small
that
had
i
wealth
of
ophir
lands
for
one
of
them
i
give
it
all
my
hath
no
wealth
they
say
but
when
they
do
i
tell
them
nay
for
oh
she
hath
a
face
so
fair
such
winsome
light
about
it
plays
for
worldly
wealth
i
nothing
care
so
i
can
look
upon
her
face
my
hath
no
wealth
they
say
but
when
they
do
i
tell
them
nay
for
endless
wealth
of
mind
hath
she
her
heart
so
stored
with
precious
lore
her
riches
they
as
countless
be
as
shells
upon
the
ocean
shore
my
hath
no
wealth
they
say
but
when
they
do
i
tell
them
nay
the
bough
hath
less
of
grace
and
on
wild
violets
when
she
treads
they
turn
to
look
into
her
face
and
scarcely
bow
their
azure
heads
my
hath
no
wealth
they
say
but
when
they
do
i
tell
them
nay
for
oh
she
hath
herself
in
fee
and
this
is
more
than
worlds
to
me
a
valentine
my
patron
saint
valentine
why
dost
thou
leave
me
to
repine
still
supplicating
at
her
shrine
but
bid
her
eyes
to
me
incline
i
ask
no
other
sun
to
shine
more
rich
than
is
golconda
mine
range
all
that
woman
song
or
wine
can
give
wealth
power
and
fame
combine
for
her
i
gladly
all
resign
take
all
the
pearls
are
in
the
brine
sift
heaven
for
stars
earth
flowers
entwine
but
be
her
heart
my
valentine
a
portrait
a
mouth
like
a
warm
sweet
rose
wherein
are
gleaming
pearls
all
pure
and
bright
as
dewdrops
nestled
where
the
zephyr
blows
with
pinion
soft
across
the
humid
night
a
cheek
not
ruddy
but
and
fair
where
whiles
the
rich
patrician
blood
is
seen
as
though
it
knew
itself
a
thing
too
rare
for
common
gaze
yet
did
its
high
demean
a
brow
serene
and
pure
as
her
white
soul
by
which
the
sifted
snow
would
blackened
seem
that
sleeps
untrodden
where
the
northern
pole
rests
calm
unscanned
save
by
the
moon
chaste
beam
eyes
gray
as
summer
twilight
skies
are
gray
and
deep
with
light
as
deep
still
waters
are
tender
as
evening
smile
when
kissing
day
yet
bright
and
true
as
is
her
lustrous
star
these
all
unite
and
with
accordant
grace
make
heaven
mirrored
ever
in
her
face
félice
you
are
very
fair
félice
wondrous
fair
and
the
light
deep
in
your
eyes
is
more
soft
than
summer
skies
and
rare
roses
in
your
cheek
play
with
lilies
play
as
pleasure
plays
with
care
and
your
throat
is
white
félice
wondrous
white
white
as
sifted
snow
i
wis
ere
the
sun
hath
a
kiss
high
up
starry
or
as
in
rich
moonful
nights
parian
baths
in
cynthia
light
and
félice
your
rippling
waves
of
soft
hair
in
their
mystic
depths
aye
hold
shade
and
shimmer
of
red
gold
like
a
halo
round
your
face
lending
you
another
grace
from
the
sunbeams
shining
there
and
your
voice
is
sweet
félice
wondrous
sweet
as
the
murmur
of
the
sea
after
long
captivity
to
a
sailor
far
inland
or
as
summer
flowers
fanned
by
soft
zephyrs
blown
wheat
but
so
stony
fair
félice
is
your
heart
that
i
wonder
oft
i
own
if
you
not
mere
carven
stone
while
my
soul
your
charms
enthrall
just
some
chiseled
goddess
tall
merely
beauty
stone
and
art
love
song
love
for
youth
and
not
for
age
though
age
should
wear
a
crown
for
the
poet
not
the
sage
not
the
monarch
but
the
clown
love
for
peace
and
not
for
war
though
war
bring
all
renown
for
the
violet
not
the
star
for
the
meadow
not
the
town
love
for
lads
and
love
for
maids
courts
a
smile
and
flees
a
frown
love
for
love
and
saucy
jades
love
love
most
when
love
has
flown
love
a
cruel
tyrant
is
slays
his
victims
with
a
glance
straight
recovers
with
a
kiss
but
to
slay
again
perchance
wouldst
thou
know
where
love
doth
bide
whence
his
sharpest
arrows
fly
in
a
dimple
love
may
hide
or
the
ambush
of
an
eye
wert
thou
clad
in
triple
mail
in
some
desert
far
apart
not
a
whit
would
this
avail
love
would
find
and
pierce
thy
heart
the
oh
the
and
the
and
how
shall
we
come
to
the
is
black
and
the
foam
is
white
and
would
we
might
win
to
the
oh
the
and
the
and
how
shall
we
pass
the
the
sea
is
tost
and
the
ship
is
lost
and
deep
is
the
sleep
the
faded
spray
of
mignonette
faded
spray
of
mignonette
can
you
ever
more
forget
how
you
lay
that
summer
night
in
the
new
moon
silvery
light
dreaming
sweet
in
tranquil
rest
on
my
snowy
breast
since
her
rosy
bore
you
to
her
fragrant
lips
blessed
you
with
a
shadowy
kiss
nestled
you
again
in
bliss
envied
of
the
gods
above
all
is
faded
save
my
love
lost
roses
i
stood
beside
the
laughing
shining
river
and
shook
the
roses
down
upon
its
breast
i
watched
them
whirl
away
with
gleam
and
quiver
as
were
a
merry
jest
i
stood
beside
the
silent
sombre
river
as
creepingly
the
tide
came
from
the
sea

watched
for
my
fair
roses

her
robe
of
snow
and
gossamer
enclad
a
form
most
neat
such
sandals
green
were
never
seen
as
shod
her
twinkling
feet
her
every
step
was
melody
her
every
motion
grace
that
one
might
prize
a
thousand
eyes
to
note
both

and
face
the
motes
that
dance
in
sunny
beams
tripped
never
in
such
wise
this
lovely
sprite
danced
in
the
light
that
beamed
from
her
own
eyes
a
man
head
once
was
danced
away
you
know
how
it
befell
my
dainty
fay
danced
yesterday
men

what
that
was
but
a
graceful
girl
that
took
the
hearts
for
pelf
nay
i
was
there
and
was
i
swear
terpsichore
herself
the
an
old
idyl
of
a
richmond
all
up
the
street
at
a
stately
pace
the
maiden
passed
with
her
and
the
roses
i
paid
for
on
her
breast
were
white
as
the
eggs
in
a
while
behind
her
driver
upon
his
stool
tinkled
the
bell
of
the
mule
going
to
walk
up
the
street
i
said
she
graciously
bowed
her
beautiful
head
then
i
walk
too
is
a
lovely
day
thus
i
opened
the
ball
in
my
usual
way
do
you
see
the
car
anywhere
inquired
the
i
a
trifle
tired
i
urged
a
walk
was
a
useless
suit
she
wildly
waved
her
parachute
the
mule
stopped
quick
enow
i
handed
her
in
with
a
stately
bow
and
the
bell
rang
out
with
a
jangled
quirk
as
the
mule
went
off
with
a
jerk
three
men
as
she
entered
solemnly
rose
and
quietly
trampled
their
neighbors
toes
a
dudish
masher
left
his
place
and
edged
near
the
girl
with
the
who
sat
on
the
side
you
call
the
lee
with
the
same
sweet
smile
she
sat
on
me
the
day
it
was
lovely
mild
the
air
the
sky
like
the
maiden
face
was
fair
the
car
was
full
and
a
trifle
stale
attached
to
the
mule
with
the
stubbly
tail
yet
the
maiden
preferred
the
seat
she
hired
to
the
stroll
with
me
for
i
made
her
tired
and
now
when
the
maiden
walks
the
street
with
another
flowers
and
smile
so
sweet
wave
to
the
driver
upon
his
stool
and
stop
the
mule
while
i
purchase
a
seat
with

not
soar
at

little
dolly
dimple
in
her
green
wimple
knows
all
the
philosophers
know
that
fire
is
hot
and
ice
is
not
and
that
sun
will
melt
the
snow
she
has
heard
that
the
moon
is
made
of
green
cheese
but
she
not
quite
certain
of
this
she
knows
if
you
tickle
your
nose
you
will
sneeze
and
a
hurt
is
made
well
by
a
kiss
i
wish
i
were
wise

wise
for
mysteries

old
sweet
times

follow
closely
along
to
tell
my
love

the
words

red
violets

blue
pinks

sweet
and

roses

red
in
my
sweetheart
cheeks
deepening
tints
whenever
one
speaks
violets
are
blue
in
the
eyes
of
one
in
the
eyes
of
the
other
smileth
the
sun
but
never
were
roses
half
so
rare
and
never
were
pinks
a
tithing
as
fair
and
never
have
they
in
their
a
hundredth
part
of
the
fragrance
shed
as
my
two
flowers
in
their
sweet
both
flowers
by
nature
and
one
by
name

as
sure
as
the
bloom
grows

the
vine
