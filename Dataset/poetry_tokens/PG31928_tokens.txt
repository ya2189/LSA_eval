preface
as
some
prefatory
explanation
may
reasonably
be
expected
as
to
how
i
became
acquainted
with
the
subject
of
the
following
narrative
golfing
idyll
i
have
had
the
presumption
to
call
it
i
may
inform
the
reader
that
circumstances
induced
me
a
lady
medical
student
at
present
studying
in
london
to
take
my
autumn
holiday
in
st
andrews
i
know
the
old
place
well
and
have
many
acquaintances
there
as
to
golf
i
can
i
think
hold
my
own
with
most
of
the
golfing
sisterhood
and
am
well
up
in
the
jargon
of
the
links
and
game
one
day
found
me
in
hand
sitting
on
the
brae
side
by
the
butts
behind
the
club
as
i
sat
listlessly
toying
with
my
pencil
and
quietly
enjoying
the
scene
before
me
i
remarked
a
man
whom
i
had
not
previously
observed
also
sitting
a
few
yards
off
on
the
slope
towards
the
sea
on
closer
inspection
i
recognised
him
to
be
an
old
caddie
well
known
to
most
frequenters
of
the
links
but
not
very
creditably
i
am
sorry
to
say
as
he
was
one
of
the
sad
victims
of
the
vice
that
has
cut
off
so
many
poor
fellows
of
his
class
i
noticed
at
the
same
time
that
he
now
looked
very
decent
and
respectable
was
neatly
dressed
in
blue
serge
a
bit
of
blue
ribbon
apparent
on
the
lapel
of
his
coat
and
that
altogether
he
had
the
appearance
of
a
person
well
cared
for
he
seemed
to
be
engaged
in
an
agreeable
conversation
with
himself
as
he
sat
smiling
and
muttering
he
was
shortly
joined
by
another
man
a
stranger
to
me
a
personage
with
a
free
and
easy
manner
who
proved
also
to
be
a
caddie
as
to
how
the
latter
accosted
his
old
friend
and
what
followed
is
all
described
in
the
as
i
was
only
a
few
yards
distant
from
them
i
could
hear
distinctly
every
word
they
uttered
the
old
man
did
not
seem
to
mind
my
presence
in
the
least
before
commencing
his
tale
he
looked
round
saw
me
and
with
a
back
toss
of
his
head
which
seemed
to
say
to
his
friend
it
is
only
a
lassie
proceeded
with
his
story
throughout
the
narrative
he
was
exceedingly
animated
rising
sitting
down
and
gesticulating
as
if
under
the
influence
of
considerable
excitement
and
emotion
evidently
earnestly
intent
on
impressing
on
the
listener
the
truth
of
what
he
was
relating
the
latter
listened
and
uttering
occasional
ejaculations
such
as
oh
lord
gude
sake
ay
man
etc
the
skipper
delivered
himself
of
what
he
had
to
say
in
pure
scotch
doric
more
or
less
but
occasionally
broke
out
into
good
english
showing
himself
to
be
a
man
of
better
education
than
i
believed
him
to
be
this
idea
was
strengthened
by
his
reference
to
bunyan
and
the
extravagant
vision
at
the
hole
with
all
its
bathos
and
absurdity
suggested
some
acquaintance
with
milton
i
listened
most
attentively
i
have
a
good
memory
and
when
i
got
home
i
committed
to
paper
all
that
i
remembered
most
carefully
moreover
i
had
several
interviews
with
the
old
gentleman
and
have
done
my
best
to
convey
to
the
reader
as
accurately
as
i
could
his
version
of
his
extraordinary
adventure
as
to
my
reason
for
weaving
the
story
into
rhyming
doggerel
i
hold
myself
excused
in
that
i
did
it
for
my
own
amusement
influenced
also
by
a
belief
that
it
might
possibly
prove
more
readable
and
attractive
in
that
shape
to
the
persons
i
chiefly
wished
to
peruse

friends

preface
to
third
edition
since
i
penned
the
first
prefatory
lines
to
this
trifling
work
i
regret
to
inform
my
readers
in
st
andrews
that
my
interesting
old
friend
the
skipper
is
no
more
he
died
at
the
ripe
age
of
peace
to
his
memory
some
time
before
his
death
i
had
what
proved
to
be
a
final
interview
with
him
when
he
rehearsed
his
queer
weird
story
adding
some
curious
reminiscences
of
his
early
days
in
connection
with
the
links
of
st
andrews
and
his
favourite
pastime
as
they
may
be
interesting
to
some
of
my
older
golfing
friends
i
have
interpolated
them
into
the
rugged
doggerel
of
the
text
from
the
notes
i
took
at
the
time
he
also
at
the
same
time
pathetically
deplored
the
unreasoning
and
obstinate
incredulity
of
friends
who
persisted
in
disbelieving
his
story
and
suggested
with
a
view
to
convincing
and
converting
them
that
i
should
have
some
of
the
more
striking
incidents
in
the
story
illustrated
i
have
done
so
but
alas
his
old
eyes
will
never
look
upon
them
and
acknowledge
the
credit
due
to
mr
bannerman
the
clever
draughtsman
at
the
close
of
our
interview
he
also
alluded
to
his
precious
breeks
with
which
in
his
opinion
rest
the
of
his
adventure
it
was
his
intention
he
told
me
to
have
them
framed
and
glazed
with
the
fateful
mark
prominently
displayed
the
date
incident
carefully
printed
to
be
made
over
at
his
death
to
the
local
museum
and
safe
custody
of
mr
couttes
it
was
not
every
man

proudly
asserted
who
could
receive

he
drove
forthwith
a
splendid
stroke
but
of
little
good
it
proved
to
be
for
again
i
took
the
hole
in
three
up
i
said
gallant

a
treat

was
my
luck
with
you
to
meet
you
are
indeed
a
beauty
without
paint
the
picture
of
a
drouthy
saint
and
thus
he
sneered
and
scoffed
and
chaffed
while
at
my
speech
he
mocked
and
laughed
from
fearing
i
began
to
hate
him
and
vow
i
do
my
best
to
beat
him
but
man
is
frail
and
human
vows
aye
come
to
nocht
when
they
oppose
the
powers
that
rule
for
good
or
evil
and
my
opponent
was
the
deevil
blind
stupid
and
wi
drink
demented
i
couldna
see
nor
comprehend
it
but
soon
alas
i
learned
the
truth
wi
mental
pain
and
muckle
ruth
the
moon
still
shed
its
blessed
light
and
calm
and
lovely
was
the
night
oh
daavid
had
you
but
been
there
wi
your
leemonade
and

and

he
listened
looked
and
gravely
smiled
to
hear
his
majesty
reviled
by
simple
clay
so
easily
beguiled
thoughtful
he
stood
and
stroked
his
beard
then
presto
vanished
disappeared
gone
like
a
flash
i
looked
and
wondered
and
as
i
gaped
and
gazed
and
pondered
beneath
my
feet
the
ground
began
to
tremble
with
earthquake
shock
to
rock
and
rumble
and
the
scene
thick
darkness
crept
deep
gloom
prevailed
the
soft
wind
slept
then
lightning
flared
with
vivid
sheen
blinding
and
dazzling
my
bewildered
een
and
thunder
bellowed
forth
with
awful
roar
echoing
from
shore
to
sea
from
sea
to
shore
from
lucklaw
to
drumcarrow
from
drumcarrow
to
kinkell
roaring
and
rattling
with
resounding
swell
peal
followed
peal
and
flash
on
flash
hissing
and
rumbling
with
terrific
crash
the
wind
subdued
burst
forth
anew
and
howling
whistling
wilder
blew
deep
groans
and
wailing
filled
the
air
of
souls
in
anguish
and
despair
loud
shouts
of
and
clash
of
cleeks
and
demon
golfers
yells
and
shrieks
commingling
with
the
mournful
wail
of
swept
before
the
gale
illustration
at
last
the
thunder
ceased
and
all
was
still
deep
silence
reigned
dale
and
hill
then
forth
a
lurid
radiance
glowed
from
earth
to
heaven
it
flowed
deep
ruby
red
the
hue
of
blood
and
in
the
midst
an
awful
presence
stood
majestic
pale
towering
in
aspect
grand
hell
chieftain
prince
of
the
rebel
band
who
fell
defying
heaven
command
lofty
brow
tossed
his
dishevelled
hair
a
front
deep
lined
with
thought
and
care
and
eyes
with
shaggy
eyebrows
pent
which
fierceness
to
their
glances
lent
those
eyes
which
blazed
with
hate
and
sadness
strangers
alike
to
hope
to
love
and
gladness
with
lips
of
scorn
whence
insults
leap
and
lies
and
calumnies
and
curses
deep
scoffings
revilings
blasphemies
malign
against
omnipotence
and
laws
divine
with
awe
and
terror
struck
i
trembling
gazed
bewildered
and
amazed
to
think
that
i
should
hap
to
contemplate
the
lineaments
of
h
l
great
potentate
with
shuddering
dread
i
feared
his
eagle
eye
should
wretch
like
me
by
cruel
chance
espy
alas
my
fate
the
hated
glance
it
fell
nought
could
escape
the
blighting
eye
of
h
l
staggering
i
fell
like
riven
oak
struck
to
the
earth
by
lightning
stroke
jockie
my
lad
i
swooned
away
of
sense
bereft
how
long
i
can
not
say
hard
by
where
old
daa
drives
his
trade
o
and
leemonade
i
felt
the
cool
soft
morning
air
to
fan
my
cheek
and
raise
my
hair
conscious
at
last
i
raised
my
eyes
conceive
my
horror
and
surprise
to
see
friend
clootie
stand
before
me
leering
and
grinning
bending
me
my
heart
was
like
to
burst
with
fear
and
hatred
and
disgust
i
cried
beseeched
him
to
forgive
me
and
begged
him
on
my
knees
to
leave
me
he
laughed
and
told
me
hold
my
jargon
to
stir
my
stumps
make
good
my
bargain
match
you
know
he
said
ended
and
luck
may
turn
and
mine
be
mended
the
remaining
holes
may
fall
to
me
then
skipper
dear
where
will
you
be
i
not
had
one
and
eight
you
taken
you
need
one
more
to
save
your
bacon
little
hole
to
save
your
soul
i
stand
to
lose
name
fame
and
purse
not
that
i
care
a
tinker
curse
but
you
should
fortune
now
forsake
you
your
freedom
gone
my
slave
i
make
you
play
up
and
save
your
skin
strike
for
your
name
and
native
green
illustration
i
heard
and
as
i
gazed
upon
him
transformed
he
seemed
some
change
come
him
he
caught
my
eye
divined
my
thought
and
gave
the
explanation
honour
you
i
changed
my
suit
my
taste
and
style
none
can
dispute
i
now
assume
my
sporting
dress
the
garb
i
wear
when
i
mean
business
i
donned
my
tail
and
doffed
my
boots
you
see
me
in
my
native
cloots
man
fond
familiar
friendly
devil
aye
gracious
debonair
and
civil
smiling
he
stood
his
arms
akimbo
the
deil
himself
the
prince
o
limbo
oh
jockie
crushed
wi
grief
and
shame
a
prey
to
fear
remorse
and
blame
like
vessel
in
the
bay
her
rudder
gone
her
masts
away
left
to
the
mercy
of
the
waves
and
tossed
a
helpless
hulk
and
lost
belief
in
succour
still
remained
the
distant
hope
sustained
so
stranded
in
this
awful
hole
i
turned
to
heaven
to
save
my
soul
i
prayed
beseeched
the
powers
on
high
to
help
me
in
my
agony
i
prayed
as
i
prayed
before
in
anguish
keen
i
vowed
and
swore
this
trouble
gone
this
sorrow
ended
my
wicked
life
should
be
amended
this
struggle
this
combat
passed
this
drucken
bout
should
be
my
last
then
hope
sweet
hope
began
to
flow
and
swell
my
breast
with
genial
glow
and
courage
that
had
gane
wi
fiery
rush
cam
back
again
my
native
pride
love
o
the
game
blazed
in
my
heart
like
altar
flame
i
felt
that
tho
a
fool
i
been
i
still
could
battle
for
the
green
resolved
restored
i
rose
defiant
doubts
and
fears

pause
and
kindly

about
that
tail
it
is
so
curious
why
jock
the
thocht
gars
me
scunner
with
it
he
dealt
me
sic
dishonour
albeit
it
was
indeed
a
stunner
i
canna
think
without
wunner
it
was
at
least
a
fathom
lang
and
tapered
at
the
end
a
stang
like
harpoon
dart
or
arrow
head
glittering
and
gleaming
fiery
red
was
nae
doot
gey
thick
at
the
root
but
that
was
covered
by
his
coat
so
soople
he
could
a
skelp
could
licht
his
pipe
or
pick
his
teeth
and
at
his
pleasure
short
or
lang
it
telescoped
up
to
the
stang
besides
it
was
a
choice
dumb
caddie
and
quite
as
helpful
as
a
laddie
by
his
left
side
he
made
it
swirl
around
his
clubs
like
snake
to
twirl
they
stood
erect
quite
near
and
handy
as
the
arm
o
jock
or
sandy
to
see
him
like
a
puddock
squattin
his
tail
stiff
oot
the
sod
pat
pattin
viewing
his
putt
to
find
the
line
was
enough
to
mak
a
cuddy
grin
there
was
little
grin
in
me
that
mornin
i
wasna
in
a
mood
for
scornin
illustration
the
game
i
was
about
to
witness
it
wasna
in
my
power
to
compass
my
fears
they
soon
were
realised
and
my
poor
play
that
i
so
prized
i
saw
eclipsed
and
beaten
hollow
a
bitter
pill
for
me
to
swallow
hole
after
hole
he
stole
away
with
masterly
and
brilliant
play
and
ever
and
anon
he
jeered
me
and
with
his
cursed
tail
he
skeered
me
that
tail
it
curled
and
squirmed
and
gleamed
the
stang
it
glowed
it
seemed
it
touched
it
brunt
and
bristled
the
very
sod
it
scorched
and
frizzled
i
played
my
best
i
strove
and
swat
wha
could
contend
foe
like
that
a

him
laughin
and
with
the
little
deils
i
fondly
hoped
he
come
to
grief
and
with
hole
or
half
i
get
relief
but
no
such
luck
alas
for
me
for
again
he
nailed
the

in

the

three
holes
he
did
in

and
heaven
preserve
me
we
were
even
my

gane
the

oh
jock
i
shuddered
in
despair
what
skill
o
mortal
could
prevail
against
a
foe
wi
cloots
and
tail
the
tail
it
now
was
blazin
red
and
from
the
point
bright
sparks
it
shed
and
squirmed
and
curled
as
if
wi
glee
possessed
wi
joy
at
leatherin
me
tremblin
abashed
depressed
i
stood
my
threatened
fate
it
chilled
my
blood
cold
swat
bedewed
me
froze
my
marrow
i
felt
like
puddock
a
harrow
or
thief
that
views
the
rope
a
prepared
and
ready
for
his
stranglin
the
morning
breeze
blew
cool
and
free
sweet
fresh
and
caller
frae
the
sea
the
sun
with
ruddy
cheek
had
risen
not
long
from
forth
his
watery
prison
the
strand
was
bathed
with
golden
light
and
all
was
beautiful
and
bright
as
for
auld
sin
he
stood
serene
he
little
cared
to
view
the
scene
his
arms
were
crossed
one
hand
on
chin
and
on
his
face
sardonic
grin
with
keen
and
glittering
eye
he
viewed
me
and
seemed
to
look
right
thro
and
thro
me
my
poor
heart
throbbing
with
affright
full
well
he
gauged
my
sorry
plight
quoth
he
dost
thou
feel
you
had
your
tussle
with
the
deil
hast
got
a
lesson
eh
in
golf
just
one
hole
more
and
then
enough
i
seen
your
swagger
heard
your
boast
methinks
i
got
you
now
on
toast
oh
jock
so
horrible
his
smile
just
like
a
loathsome
crocodile
wi
een
and
dreadfu
snigger
about
to
supper
on
a
nigger
cool
and
composed
i
tried
to
look
as
calm
as
might
an
aged
rook
on
tree
top
perched
or
giddy
mast
exposed
to
wild
and
stormy
blast
but
still
a
shadowy
hope
remained
by
my
late
fervent
vow
sustained
that
should
the
powers
aboon
preserve
me
good
play
or
fickle
fortune
save
me
to
mend
my
life
i
would
endeavour

slight
o

i
ran

to

he
struck
me
wi

right
on

just
like
a
flail
so
cruel
strong
severe
a
lounder
in
faith
it
felled
me
flat
a
flounder
illustration
i
ken
nae
mair
all
was
confusion
how
long
i
lay
i
have
nae
notion
my
friends
they
tell
me
i
was
found
senseless
and
on
the
ground
home
to
my
bed
they
kindly
bore
me
made
fruitless
efforts
to
restore
me
but
all
in
vain
for
fever
seized
me
and
friendly
death
released
me
seven
days
and
nights
i
raved
and
tossed
for
ever
screaming
lost
lost
lost
the
ravings
of
a
fevered
brain
as
i
went
and
again
the
scenes
and
horrors
of
that
night
freezing
my
listeners
with
affright
a
weary
time
but
to
be
brief
kind
heaven
in
mercy
sent
relief
at
last
far
gane
i
found
my
head
and
kent
the
folk
about
my
bed
among
them
i
was
pleased
to
view
my
worthy
friend
nurse
killiegrew
for
she
had
with
her
presence
blessed
me
and
thro
my
illness
watched
and
nursed
me
i
had
their
warm
congratulations
and
their
demands
for
explanations
about
my
ravings
wild
and
furious
women
are
aye
sae
keen
and
curious
man
quoth
nurse
had
a
lesson
ease
your
mind
to
mak
confession
abashed
ashamed
i
hesitated
at
last
with
pain
my
tale
related
my
yarn
of
course
made
great
sensation
they
groaned
and
grat
at
the
narration
save
nurse
who
shook
her
head
in
sadness
incredulous
declared
my
story
madness
said
she
fancy
you
have
seen
the
deevil
and
golfed
and
bargained
wi
the
prince
o
evil
you
had
the
horrors
it
would
seem
and
what
you
tell
us
was
a
drunkard
dream
said
i
i
felt
quite
nettled
do
not
think
you
fairly
settled
the
nature
of
my
strange
distraction
at
least
not
to
my
simple
satisfaction
to
clear
myself
my
honour
tells
me
a
stern
necessity
compels
me
against
your
most
injurious
explanations
i
have
strong
proof
in
bodily
sensations
for
obvious
reasons
i
would
fain
refrain
from
reference
to
the
region
of
my
pain

my

and
snorting
red
on

bent
she
turned
to
me
for
my
consent
i
saw
that
things
were
getting
serious
and
feared

so
keen

nurse
heard

saw
the
cummer
zeal
and
looked
as
if
diverted
weel
she
laughed
amused
at
the
sensation
but
flat
refused
the
explanation
and
chaffed
and
scoffed
in
huge
derision
declaring
they
had
lost
their
reason
doited
women
do
you

what
is
so
evident
says
she
drunken
wight
has
sat
upon
his

alight
no
doubt
the
cause
of
mark
and
pain
to
me
it
is
as
porridge
plain
i
exclaimed
enraged
indignant
explanation
is
repugnant
to

sense
and

and
feelin
do
think
that
with
a
fool
you
dealin
for
though
to
drink
a
slave
i
been
i
say
it
with
contrition
keen
i
had
horrors
what

whatever

your

i
keep
my
opinion
i

my
failin
i
but
human
was
nae
use
arguing
wi
a

now
jock
my
story
told
my
yarn
is
ended
some
things
there
be
that
ca
be
mended

deevil
thank

that

sair
hudden
doon
wi
muckle
sack
chokefu
o

upon
his

warstlin
and
pechin
on

the
burden
fell
and
rolled
behind
him
to
the
jaws
o

gone
all
his
sadness
grateful
he
sang
and
danced
in
gladness
i
grim
auld
pilgrim
in

manner
compared
wi
him
a
hardened
sinner
thro
forty
years
i
burden
borne
by
self
despised
of

the
scorn
now
safe
forever
from
the
curse
that
starved
my
body
toomed
my

i
anchored
in
a
peacefu
haven
no
more
for

the
cruel
cravin
no
more
the
haunts
for
me
the
drunkard
shout
the
maddening
glee
the
ribald
jokes
and
songs
and
laughter
the
sickening
pangs
that
follow
after
gone
gone
forever
all
the
filth
and
folly
the
aches
the
woes
the
melancholy
