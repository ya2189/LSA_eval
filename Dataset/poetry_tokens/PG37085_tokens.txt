my
dear
sir
you
may
think
it
unkind
of
me
to
interrupt
the
peaceful
calm
of
your
holiday
with
a
poem
about
business
but
i
assure
you
my
dear
sir
that
i
do
so
with
the
very
best
intentions
and
at
the
call
of
what
i
consider
to
be
duty
duty
as
you
know
is
a
tremendous
abstraction
and
brings
a
man
into
all
sorts
of
difficult
corners
it
was
duty
that
took
you
into
parliament
similarly
it
is
duty
that
constrains
me
to
odes
when
a
man
sees
another
man
and
pities
him
it
is
the
duty
of
the
first
man
to
let
the
other
man
know
about
it
delicately
i
pity
you
my
dear
mr
private
member
from
the
bottom
of
a
bottomless
heart
many
a
time
and
oft
in
the
course
of
my
rambles
through
the
lobbies
and
liquor
bars
of
stephens
it
has
been
my
ineffable
portion
to
run
across
you
silk
hat
frock
coat
baggy
trousers
patient
stare
bored
expression
suddenly
you
smile
and
crook
the
pregnant
hinges
of
the
back
of
your
neck
wiggle
the
three
misses
wiggle
and
little
master
wiggle
wife
daughters
and
son
of
forthree
wiggle
draper
and
burgess
of
the
good
old
parliamentary
division
of
mudsher
west
are
up
from
mudsher
west
and
they
want
showin
round
the
you
know
round
you
go
again
you
appear
in
the
strangers
lobby
spectacles
on
nose
somebody
card
in
hand
the
policeman
roars
out
name
of
leading
constituent
leading
constituent
departed
in
a
huff
twenty
minutes
ago
because
he
thought
you
were
not
attending
to
him
there
being
no
answer
policeman
roars
out
name
of
leading
constituent
once
more
name
echoes
along
lords
lobby
but
not
being
there
leading
constituent
fails
to
come
forward
you
look
embarrassed
turn
tail
retire
to
your
back
bench
and
feel
deucedly
uncomfortable
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
you
would
like
to
get
away
to
the
theatre
but
you
dare
not
do
it
there
are
whips
about
you
would
like
to
go
home
to
bed
you
must
wait
the
good
pleasure
of
the
course
of
the
debate
you
would
like
to
stand
on
your
hind
legs
and
address
the
house
on
large
matters
but
you
know
in
your
heart
that
the
house
will
stand
absolutely
nothing
from
you
bar
a
question
or
so
you
sit
and
sit
and
sit
through
dull
debate
after
dull
debate
and
you
sigh
for
the
hustings
and
the
brass
bands
and
the
banquets
and
the
and
wonder
how
it
comes
to
pass
that
you
who
were
once
set
down
in
the
for
a
blend
of
demosthenes
and
john
bright
can
never
get
more
than
twenty
words
off
the
end
of
your
tongue
after
speaker
sir
oh
my
dear
mr
private
member
your
case
is
indeed
a
sad
one
and
it
is
all
the
sadder
when
one
comes
to
reflect
that
as
a
general
rule
you
are
a
sincereish
sort
of
man
burning
and
bursting
with
a
desire
to
do
your
poor
suffering
country
a
bit
of
good
you
know
that
the
men
who
have
the
ear
of
the
house
are
mere
talkers
that
they
are
only
playing
the
party
game
and
that
the
country
may
go
to
pot
for
anything
they
care
and
yet
they
make
their
speeches
and
get
them
reported
at
length
in
the
papers
and
are
given
places
in
the
cabinet
and
go
for
with
the
king
what
time
you
grow
old
and
grey
and
obese
and
bleary
eyed
and
never
get
the
smallest
show
i
pity
you
my
dear
mr
private
member
i
do
really
but
for
your
comfort
i
may
tell
you
that
all
you
lack
is
courage
and
brains
to
the
briton
peace
dear
sir
or
madam
as
the
case
may
be
when
britain
first
at
heaving
command
arose
from
out
the
azure
main
this
was
the
chawter
of
that
land
and
gawdian
sang
this
strain
do
you
think
so
for
my
own
part
i
am
quite
sure
of
it
monday
night
convinced
me
mafeking
night
as
you
may
remember
was
a
honeyed
and
beautiful
affair
but
peace
night
i
think
really
outdid
it
in
splendours
at
the
cafe
which
i
most
frequent
all
was
peace
round
the
table
next
mine
there
were
seventeen
jews
with
a
union
jack
ever
and
anon
between
drinks
as
it
were
they
held
up
that
union
jack
and
yelled
shend
him
victoriouth
and
gloriouth
long
reign
over
uth
i
wonder
my
dear
sir
or
madam
why
the
jews
are
so
pleased
i
ca
make
it
out
howsomever
pleased
they
are
and
a
pleased
jew
is
worth
a
king
ransom
or
words
to
that
effect
peace
my
dear
sir
or
madam
is
a
chaste
and
choice
thing
outside
the
aforesaid
cafe
the
crowd
was
so
numerous
and
exuberant
that
i
was
compelled
much
to
my
annoyance
of
course
to
remain
inside
till
then
i
went
home
in
the
friendly
embrace
of
a
for
a
little
while
there
was
much
shouting
and
yelling
and
roaring
and
squeaking
and
singing
and
then
i
knew
no
more
my
cab
bowled
away
through
the
sweet
evening
air
that
is
to
say
if
the
common
or
regent
street
growler
ever
does
bowl
away
and
all
the
time
i
snored
duly
awakened
outside
my
bungalow
i
raked
up
the
fare
and
in
reply
to
kind
enquiries
in
the
hall
i
remarked
peace
o
woman
of
mine
peace
to
the
cambridge
crew
my
dear
cambridge
you
have
pulled
it
off
as
all
men
know
this
ode
will
make
oxford
pretty
sick
but
the
spoils
are
to
the
victor
if
oxford
had
rowed
better
and
won
they
should
have
had
a
nice
new
ode
like
good
boys
but
they
have
been
and
gone
and
lost
and
are
therefore
not
fit
subjects
for
immortal
verse
pah
i
pass
by
oxford
as
for
you
dear
cambridge
here
to
you
in
spite
of
your
long
and
honourable
connection
with
the
manufacture
of
sossiges
there
appears
to
be
something
in
you
which
is
more
than
can
be
said
for
some
of
the
sossiges
cambridge
my
own
you
have
won
the
bowt
rice
a
drink
what
is
the
good
of
winning
the
bowt
rice
if
you
do
a
drink
i
do
know
and
i
sure
you
do
also
what
is
the
good
of
winning
the
bowt
rice
at
all
i
give
it
up
yes
i
do
really
please
do
let
me
give
it
up
you
have
won
you
can
afford
to
be
generous
suffer
me
to
indulge
my
little
whim
there
is
no
good
in
winning
the
bowt
rice
cambridge
no
good
at
all
on
the
other
hand
when
i
come
to
think
of
it
i
am
not
quite
sure
that
to
have
rowed
in
the
cambridge
boat
which
won
the
bowt
rice
is
materially
to
have
damaged
one
prospects
or
career
at
the
very
least
it
makes
one
safe
for
a
tutor
job
at
per
annum
and
what
person
from
cambridge
could
wish
for
more
i
have
heard
of
a
man
who
rowed
in
a
winning
cambridge
boat
and
is
now
driving
a
hansom
cab
and
i
have
heard
of
another
man
who
omitted
to
row
in
a
winning
cambridge
boat
and
is
now
driving
a
you
see
the
difference
of
course
after
all
to
row
in
a
winning
cambridge
boat
does
give
one
a
sort
of
start
in
life
and
do
you
forget
it
always
remember
my
dear
cambridge
who
you
are
you
licked
oxford
by
five
lengths
in
this
is
probably
all
you
will
get
for
your
father
money
be
thankful
to
dan
leno
his
appearance
at
dear
dan
leno
this
has
been
a
great
week
for
art
one
of
the
biggest
weeks
in
fact
on
record
for
at
the
beginning
of
the
week
my
dear
leno
you
were
a
mere
popular
entertainer
whereas
at
the
present
moment
you
are
a
proud
and
man
and
in
a
position
to
walk
about
the
strand
with
a
diamond
e
scintillating
in
your
cravat
the
thing
that
was
anticipated
by
the
intelligent
paragraphists
my
dear
leno
has
come
to
pass
his
britannic
majesty
king
edward
et
intend
to
give
artists
and
authors
and
people
a
little
bit
more
of
a
show
than
has
hitherto
fallen
to
their
lot
his
majesty
my
dear
leno
has
always
been
noted
for
his
tact
and
in
opening
the
ball
with
you
as
it
were
his
majesty
has
exhibited
an
amount
of
tact
which
leaves
absolutely
nothing
to
be
desired
had
he
commenced
with
swinburne
or
myself
or
hall
caine
what
howls
there
would
have
been
whereas
as
it
is
everybody
is
delighted
and
the
halls
resound
nightly
with
his
majesty
praises
furthermore
besides
being
tactful
the
king
choice
of
you
my
dear
leno
for
an
invitation
to
sandringham
has
its
basis
in
a
profound
common
sense
for
i
am
acquainted
with
nobody
in
the
movement
my
dear
leno
who
could
have
done
the
sandringham
turn
with
anything
like
the
success
which
appears
to
have
been
yours
i
gather
from
interviews
that
the
king
laughed
heartily
at
your
jokes
and
that
it
was
a
treat
to
see
him
enjoying
himself
it
is
just
here
that
swinburne
myself
and
hall
caine
would
have
broken
down
it
seems
to
me
unlikely
that
the
king
would
have
laughed
at
swinburne
jokes
my
own
jokes
as
everybody
is
aware
are
constructed
on
a
principle
which
entirely
prohibits
laughter
while
as
for
hall
caine
jokes
they
have
such
a
tremendous
sale
that
it
is
not
good
form
to
laugh
at
them
leno
my
boy
you
have
been
the
humble
means
of
doing
us
all
a
great
kindness
those
jokes
of
yours
which
have
tickled
royal
ears
will
be
nectar
to
me
when
next
it
is
my
pleasurable
duty
to
sit
under
you
that
hand
which
royalty
has
shaken
i
shall
grasp
with
an
added
fervour
that
smile
will
cheer
me
all
the
more
readily
because
it
has
cheered
my
liege
lord
and
sovereign
those
feet
but
after
all
the
great
point
is
the
scarf
pin
i
suppose
you
would
not
care
to
lend
it
to
me
for
a
week
or
two
while
i
have
one
made
like
it
to
the
pope
may
it
please
your
holiness
there
are
possibly
two
or
it
may
be
three
men
in
europe
who
could
indite
this
ode
without
treading
on
anybody
corns
after
mature
reflection
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
i
am
those
three
men
so
that
you
will
understand
well
my
dear
pope
i
hear
on
all
hands
that
you
are
engaged
at
the
present
moment
in
the
cheerful
act
and
process
of
having
a
jubilee
i
have
had
several
myself
and
i
know
what
pleasant
little
functions
they
are
especially
when
the
king
sends
a
mission
to
congratulate
one
on
them
to
proceed
you
must
know
my
dear
pope
that
by
conviction
and
in
my
own
delightful
country
i
am
a
rabid
kensitite
protestant
all
my
ancestors
figure
gloriously
in
foxe
book
of
martyrs
and
if
they
do
they
ought
to
also
i
never
go
into
smithfield
without
thinking
of
the
fires
thereof
and
thanking
my
lucky
stars
that
this
is
protestant
england
and
that
the
king
defends
the
faith
but
when
i
get
on
to
the
continent
to
do
my
in
paris
or
my
ten
days
at
lovely
lucerne
or
my
walk
with
lunn
in
the
footsteps
of
paul
why
then
somehow
the
bottom
falls
clean
out
of
my
kensitariousness
and
i
become
a
decent
catholic
that
is
curious
but
true
and
may
probably
be
accounted
for
by
differences
of
climate
however
we
can
leave
that
here
in
england
my
dear
pope
we
all
like
you
whether
we
be
catholics
or
protestants
or
jews
or
gentiles
or
members
of
the
playgoers
club
and
we
all
see
you
in
our
minds
eye
seated
benevolently
upon
your
throne
giving
people
blessings
or
walking
in
the
vatican
garden
clothed
on
with
simple
white
we
all
think
of
you
my
beloved
pope
as
a
diaphanous
and
dear
old
gentleman
whose
intentions
are
the
kindest
in
the
world
and
yet
and
yet
and
yet
the
memory
of
smithfield
so
rages
in
our
honest
british
blood
that
in
spite
of
your
white
garments
and
your
placid
gentle
ways
we
feel
quite
sure
that
you
do
carry
somewhere
about
your
person
a
box
of
matches
and
that
if
certain
people
had
their
way
you
would
soon
be
lighting
such
a
candle
in
england
that
we
should
want
a
new
foxe
and
a
new
book
of
martyrs
of
about
the
size
of
a
pantechnicon
hence
it
is
my
dear
pope
that
we
er
englishmen
remain
protestant
and
make
the
king
swear
fearful
oaths
against
popery
and
all
its
works
although
for
aught
one
knows
to
the
contrary
he
may
have
mass
said
twice
daily
behind
the
curtain
as
it
were
all
the
same
i
wish
you
good
wishes
as
to
this
your
jubilee
and
to
the
right
honourable
joseph
chamberlain
his
audience
of
the
my
dear
chamberlain
since
you
last
heard
from
me
many
curious
things
have
happened
both
in
birmingham
and
abroad
as
to
the
happenings
in
birmingham
nobody
cares
tuppence
for
them
the
happenings
abroad
however
are
a
different
matter
inasmuch
as
they
have
brought
you
great
fame
and
cost
us
a
lot
of
money
your
influence
in
the
governance
of
this
great
country
my
dear
chamberlain
is
undoubted
when
you
say
things
it
is
understood
that
all
your
sit
up
and
look
good
we
do
like
it
they
say
in
their
decent
hearts
but
joseph
says
it
must
be
so
and
be
so
it
must
to
the
delicate
souls
of
arthur
james
and
george
and
broddy
and
the
rest
of
you
must
my
dear
chamberlain
be
a
good
deal
of
a
trial
but
somehow
they
have
to
put
up
with
you
even
as
the
honest
martyr
has
to
put
up
with
his
shirt
and
for
my
own
part
i
rather
like
to
see
it
at
any
rate
in
a
sort
of
way
do
you
know
but
my
dear
chamberlain
in
the
daily
papers
of
monday
morning
what
did
i
read
why
i
read
chamberlain
had
an
audience
of
the
king
yesterday
afternoon
and
yesterday
afternoon
was
sunday
afternoon
now
my
dear
joseph
i
do
not
mind
in
the
least
what
you
do
to
arthur
james
or
what
you
do
to
george
or
what
you
do
to
broddy
or
whether
you
do
it
on
sunday
afternoons
or
on
any
other
afternoon
but
i
really
must
draw
the
line
somewhere
and
i
wish
you
to
understand
that
if
you
go
to
see
his
majesty
the
king
on
sunday
afternoons
on
the
afternoon
of
the
sabbath
as
they
would
say
in
birmingham
you
do
so
entirely
without
my
approval
i
think
it
is
scandalous
and
not
being
a
politician
i
have
no
hesitation
in
saying
what
i
think
somehow
while
i
know
you
to
be
a
competent
man
of
business
you
never
figure
in
my
mind
eye
joseph
as
the
sort
of
man
who
ought
to
have
personal
communication
with
his
sovereign
particularly
on
sunday
afternoons
birmingham
men
were
not
born
to
grace
the
court
and
when
it
comes
to
the
furnishing
of
pleasant
sunday
afternoons
for
monarchs
in
my
opinion
they
are
quite
out
of
it
when
business
presses
as
it
no
doubt
did
press
on
sunday
joseph
it
is
your
business
as
a
birmingham
man
to
remember
your
origin
and
if
you
have
anything
on
your
mind
which
really
must
be
communicated
to
his
gracious
majesty
king
edward
the
seventh
to
look
up
the
peerage
and
send
round
somebody
who
is
as
one
might
say
fit
for
the
job
there
is
always
salisbury
there
is
always
arthur
james
there
is
always
george
and
there
is
always
broddy
these
men
my
dear
joseph
are
gentlemen
and
have
known
the
court
all
their
lives
what
they
do
on
sundays
i
neither
know
nor
care
but
i
have
no
doubt
that
if
you
told
them
to
go
round
and
see
the
king
they
would
go
hotfoot
and
see
him
so
that
you
have
no
excuse
joseph
birmingham
will
no
doubt
forgive
you
this
once
as
for
me
i
solemnly
swear
that
i
never
will
to
the
tsar
my
dear
tsar
i
am
owing
you
the
usual
apologies
i
did
not
come
to
dunkirk
i
did
not
come
to
dunkirk
i
did
not
come
to
dunkirk
i
was
billed
as
usual
but
at
the
last
moment
i
did
not
come
so
that
it
was
in
vain
my
dear
tsar
that
you
and
your
imperial
spouse
to
whom
i
offer
my
very
humble
duty
it
was
in
vain
that
you
and
your
imperial
spouse
to
whom
i
again
offer
my
very
humble
duty
searched
the
poop
of
with
your
imperial
binoculars
i
was
not
there
i
was
not
there
o
pregnant
phrase
i
was
not
there
i
was
not
on
the
poop
i
was
not
on
the
poop
i
was
not
on
the
poop
i
was
not
even
abaft
the
binnacle
in
fine
i
was
not
there
at
all
and
why
ah
ingrate
that
i
am
why
o
why
the
north
sea
or
german
ocean
my
dear
tsar
no
doubt
hath
its
pearls
it
also
hath
other
things
as
for
example
a
route
i
went
on
that
route
on
saturday
last
it
is
a
nice
route
i
give
you
my
word
for
it
but
the
north
sea
or
german
ocean
also
has
an
route
on
which
route
i
went
on
sunday
evening
and
part
of
monday
morning
last
five
hours
my
dear
tsar
had
i
of
that
route
and
i
am
now
at
a
place
called
thame
in
oxfordshire
recruiting
though
i
promised
a
man
at
bruges
and
another
man
at
ypres
that
i
would
infallibly
see
him
at
dunkirk
the
loubets
are
of
course
bitterly
disappointed
but
you
can
explain
for
me
can
you
not
my
dear
tsar
you
understand
do
you
not
the
north
sea
or
german
ocean
fatigued
you
did
it
not
that
is
precisely
what
it
did
to
me
fatigue
is
a
good
word
i
thank
thee
tsar
for
that
beautiful
word
fatigue
all
day
monday
i
felt
so
fatigued
that
i
went
and
joined
a
peace
society
the
boer
war
my
dear
tsar
is
entirely
over
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
henceforth
i
quarrel
with
no
man
fatigue
has
laid
its
heavy
hand
upon
me
i
am
too
much
fatigued
to
quarrel
even
with
the
partner
of
my
joys
and
sorrows
peace
perfect
peace
is
what
i
require
and
what
i
mean
having
time
writes
no
wrinkles
on
the
route
but
you
should
see
the
people
who
have
been
that
way
thame
in
oxfordshire
pitches
beneath
my
feet
when
i
think
of
it
to
dan
leno
dear
leno
it
is
now
many
happy
weeks
since
i
had
the
pleasure
of
addressing
you
on
the
last
occasion
you
will
remember
you
were
fresh
from
sandringham
with
a
medal
and
sundry
excellent
stories
as
to
the
manner
in
which
you
had
been
received
by
his
majesty
the
king
and
the
members
of
the
royal
family
to
see
them
laugh
you
told
us
was
a
treat
since
then
you
have
gone
about
with
a
diamond
e
in
your
cravat
and
the
king
jester
written
all
over
you
as
i
have
already
stated
i
do
not
doubt
for
a
moment
that
the
king
really
did
laugh
at
leno
i
have
laughed
at
him
that
is
to
say
at
leno
myself
and
i
know
what
it
is
but
leno
being
the
of
april
it
is
my
turn
to
laugh
and
i
do
so
with
a
right
good
will
for
leno
your
cup
appears
to
be
full
inasmuch
as
for
this
day
only
you
are
actually
editing
a
paper
now
when
a
man
takes
to
editing
papers
all
is
over
with
him
the
next
step
is
into
the
unutterable
dark
i
have
read
your
paper
leno
and
i
find
that
on
the
whole
it
has
been
remarkably
well
edited
that
is
to
say
you
as
editor
and
your
big
campbell
of
that
ilk
have
had
the
good
sense
to
edit
the
paper
in
the
only
way
in
which
an
editor
should
edit
a
paper
namely
by
leaving
it
to
itself
as
much
as
possible
if
all
editors
would
have
the
sense
to
take
this
wise
course
contributors
and
subordinates
generally
would
to
say
the
least
of
it
have
a
fairly
happy
life
it
seems
in
a
way
a
pity
leno
that
you
should
waste
yourself
upon
an
evening
paper
when
there
are
so
many
morning
papers
requiring
editors
the
for
example
would
have
offered
you
a
fair
field
for
the
exercise
of
your
extraordinary
abilities
even
the
might
for
once
in
a
way
have
added
lustre
to
itself
by
taking
on
your
joyous
and
winning
lucubrations
then
there
is
which
journal
i
understand
is
always
and
still
on
the
for
that
humour
which
somehow
never
comes
its
way
but
there
leno
you
have
missed
your
chance
and
possibly
it
will
not
come
round
again
as
you
are
young
in
journalism
let
me
say
three
things
to
you
imprimis
never
be
an
editor
it
is
better
to
be
in
the
ballet
item
always
be
on
either
a
morning
paper
or
a
weekly
the
papers
keep
one
too
busy
item
if
you
are
an
editor
only
for
a
day
be
sure
to
subscribe
to
the
newspaper
press
fund
otherwise
what
will
your
widow
do
to
the
poet
laureate
my
dear
poet
laureate
do
not
i
implore
you
be
perturbed
it
is
not
my
purpose
to
harp
upon
old
strings
or
to
express
the
smallest
satisfaction
either
with
you
as
an
official
personage
or
with
your
verses
as
a
production
of
an
official
personage
i
have
called
as
it
were
for
a
little
quiet
talk
you
are
a
of
mine
consequently
i
am
a
of
yours
we
ought
to
get
on
well
together
between
ourselves
my
dear
poet
laureate
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
were
to
set
about
it
in
the
right
way
you
might
with
very
little
trouble
render
a
real
service
to
the
state
being
as
you
are
the
only
writer
fellow
who
in
his
literary
capacity
is
associated
with
the
court
you
have
if
i
may
say
so
chances
and
opportunities
such
as
do
not
appear
to
have
been
vouchsafed
to
any
other
contemporary
worker
in
the
department
of
letters
our
gracious
sovereign
lord
king
edward
vii
i
make
no
doubt
continually
consults
you
on
matters
literary
dear
austen
i
can
hear
him
saying
would
you
now
advise
me
to
read
newverse
sonnets
and
miss
jumpabouti
new
novel
or
would
you
not
of
course
my
dear
poet
laureate
if
you
were
one
of
those
stiff
ungenerous
poets
laureate
who
make
it
a
rule
to
stick
to
business
you
would
say
very
respectfully
your
majesty
honours
me
but
i
am
not
your
majesty
being
as
your
majesty
is
aware
paid
only
to
wangle
my
harp
in
celebration
of
births
deaths
and
marriages
therefore
i
must
respectfully
civilly
humbly
and
generally
otherwisely
beg
to
decline
to
answer
your
majesty
kind
inquiry
but
my
dear
poet
laureate
there
is
nothing
of
that
sort
about
you
you
believe
that
a
poet
laureate
should
not
only
be
a
sort
of
walking
rhyming
dictionary
but
also
a
general
compendium
of
advice
counsel
and
straight
tips
for
crowned
heads
hence
i
make
no
doubt
that
when
his
majesty
the
king
ask
you
for
a
hint
as
to
the
kind
of
book
he
ought
to
read
you
break
the
marble
box
of
your
wisdom
upon
the
palace
floor
and
expound
things
to
him
having
thus
the
ear
of
an
exceedingly
amiable
and
capable
monarch
you
should
by
all
means
take
advantage
of
the
circumstance
to
do
what
you
can
in
that
quarter
for
the
benefit
of
your
brethren
and
sisters
of
the
pen
many
of
them
my
dear
poet
laureate
are
at
the
present
moment
going
about
the
country
with
weary
souls
and
tattered
nerves
because
their
services
to
literature
have
not
been
blessed
and
approved
not
to
say
recognised
by
the
crown
some
of
them
believe
in
their
hearts
that
they
ought
to
have
a
peerage
others
desire
to
be
baronets
knights
and
so
forth
in
order
that
their
wives
may
be
called
lady
others
whom
i
know
would
be
well
content
with
a
humble
and
yet
others
would
go
off
their
heads
with
joy
if
they
might
only
be
invited
regularly
to
the
king
levees
and
droring
rooms
my
dear
poet
laureate
i
charge
you
to
do
your
best
for
these
suffering
people
writing
is
a
noble
art
it
should
most
certainly
be
recognised
by
the
crown
rub
these
facts
well
in
my
dear
poet
laureate
you
know
who
to
rub
into
and
while
you
are
about
it
there
are
two
persons
on
whose
behalf
you
might
use
every
legitimate
endeavour
to
rub
your
hardest
one
of
them
my
dear
poet
laureate
is
yourself
and
the
other
is
myself
your
own
desires
in
the
way
of
recognition
are
of
course
your
own
affair
ask
for
what
you
like
my
dear
poet
laureate
and
see
that
you
get
it
for
me
let
me
whisper
i
want
a
pension
to
the
american
invader
dear
sir
or
madam
as
the
case
may
be
peace
hath
her
victories
as
well
as
war
and
sometimes
when
i
have
occasion
to
travel
in
this
muggy
metropolis
of
ours
i
begin
to
wonder
whether
i
really
am
in
london
or
in
new
york
on
the
tops
of
atlas
and
all
other
at
the
of
hotels
at
all
prices
at
all
theatres
at
all
at
all
art
galleries
at
all
evenings
at
all
social
functions
metropolitan
in
their
nature
you
my
dear
sir
or
madam
as
the
case
may
be
flourish
and
are
to
the
fore
there
are
people
in
the
world
who
can
pick
you
out
at
a
glance
the
american
woman
i
am
told
wears
a
certain
kind
of
complexion
and
a
certain
kind
of
blouse
the
american
man
i
am
told
is
weedy
and
anæmic
a
cigarette
smoker
a
confirmed
spitter
and
a
moderate
drinker
he
has
a
soft
hat
and
unlimited
dollars
it
is
his
dollars
of
course
which
are
creating
all
the
trouble
they
are
beginning
to
circulate
and
wherever
honest
britons
most
do
congregate
my
tobacco
merchant
who
sells
me
two
ounces
of
the
real
thing
every
week
has
just
been
bought
up
by
an
american
syndicate
my
barber
is
in
the
same
case
and
i
feel
sure
that
the
woman
who
brings
home
the
laundry
is
seriously
considering
proposals
which
have
been
made
to
her
by
a
syndicate
of
wealthy
american
gentlemen
the
plant
in
paul
cathedral
was
it
seems
paid
for
by
an
american
another
american
is
doing
something
or
other
with
the
underground
railways
and
a
third
proposes
to
erect
a
building
which
will
contain
rooms
on
one
of
the
best
sites
on
the
new
improvement
also
i
am
using
an
american
desk
an
american
typewriter
an
american
chair
american
ink
american
pens
american
blotting
paper
american
gum
american
paper
fasteners
american
notions
an
american
pattern
of
ode
and
heaven
knows
what
besides
i
am
all
american
i
can
whistle
the
banner
i
can
really
shake
i
like
you
there
are
no
flies
on
you
how
are
roosevelt
and
all
at
home
is
pierpont
keeping
hearty
do
you
miss
carnegie
much
have
you
seen
the
eagle
at
the
zoo
is
monroe
good
for
dyspepsia
and
it
o
to
be
at
home
on
the
rolling
perarie
with
one
money
well
invested
in
english
concerns
run
by
british
labour
and
paying
good
old
fruity
nourishing
british
dividends
to
the
muddied
oaf
my
dear
muddied
oaf
while
still
a
youth
and
all
unknown
to
fame
i
went
to
school
and
on
a
certain
saturday
i
put
on
a
beautiful
blue
jersey
and
some
striped
knickers
and
betook
myself
into
a
damp
field
with
my
hands
nice
and
clean
and
my
hair
parted
within
an
hour
time
my
shins
had
the
appearance
of
a
broken
paint
can
my
garments
were
covered
with
mud
one
of
my
teeth
had
somehow
got
swallowed
and
my
hair
was
out
of
joint
when
i
come
to
think
of
it
in
that
hour
i
must
have
been
a
muddied
oaf
though
i
did
not
know
what
to
call
myself
and
no
doubt
on
that
and
successive
saturday
afternoons
i
won
my
various
journalistic
waterloos
and
contracted
a
stubborn
cardiac
hypertrophy
which
is
even
yet
with
me
for
nigh
twenty
years
however
i
have
never
to
my
knowledge
taken
part
in
a
football
match
and
in
spite
of
kipling
i
do
not
propose
to
indulge
again
in
either
rugby
or
the
other
thing
youth
loves
to
be
muddied
in
old
age
one
flings
one
mud
at
other
people
i
do
know
my
dear
muddied
oaf
how
you
like
being
called
a
muddied
oaf
the
average
muddied
oaf
of
my
acquaintance
will
not
in
the
least
understand
what
muddied
oaf
means
and
even
when
a
dozen
reporters
have
explained
it
to
him
dictionary
in
hand
he
will
not
care
you
can
not
take
the
glory
of
having
crumpled
up
the
footleum
otspurs
out
of
a
man
by
calling
him
muddy
and
as
for
oaf
when
all
is
said
it
is
a
poor
synonym
for
dashing
forward
no
my
dear
boy
phrases
out
of
poems
can
not
damp
your
ardours
and
so
far
as
you
are
concerned
rudyard
kipling
may
be
blowed
all
the
same
i
assure
you
as
an
old
muddifier
that
there
is
a
great
deal
in
what
the
gentleman
says
to
a
delicate
age
rifle
practice
presents
many
attractions
to
shoot
out
of
a
no
rifle
at
a
choice
array
of
clay
pipes
dancing
globules
and
cardboard
rabbits
is
on
the
face
of
it
a
gentleman
job
you
can
do
it
with
your
hair
parted
and
providing
you
do
get
betting
drinks
that
you
will
ring
the
bell
every
time
it
does
cost
much
regular
practice
at
the
ordinary
shooting
booths
will
no
doubt
make
a
soldier
and
a
gentleman
of
you
and
teach
you
to
fear
no
boer
in
shining
armour
these
are
points
worth
considering
also
the
game
does
not
hurt
you
need
no
lemon
to
help
you
through
with
it
you
run
no
risk
of
dislocation
fracture
hypertrophy
gouged
eye
or
broken
neck
you
are
on
velvet
all
the
time
and
when
it
comes
to
calling
names
you
will
have
the
honour
and
glory
of
being
set
down
for
a
gallant
and
defender
of
your
country
ponder
it
o
muddied
one
and
be
wise
to
a
publisher
my
dear
sir
in
the
whole
round
of
animated
nature
i
am
acquainted
with
nothing
or
nobody
who
is
generally
speaking
so
gay
gaudy
and
interesting
as
yourself
from
my
youth
up
i
have
been
taught
to
look
upon
a
publisher
as
a
very
great
person
indeed
when
i
was
young
and
courted
him
he
it
was
drew
from
me
as
morn
from
memnon
rivers
of
melody
the
which
however
he
took
good
care
not
to
glorify
with
his
imprimatur
in
those
days
i
looked
upon
publishing
as
a
trade
and
poetry
as
a
profession
recently
i
have
become
wise
and
i
feel
in
the
heart
of
me
that
publishing
is
a
profession
and
poetry
a
trade
in
spite
of
all
that
has
been
said
to
the
contrary
barabbas
certainly
was
not
a
publisher
i
have
not
had
time
to
look
him
up
but
i
feel
quite
sure
that
he
was
not
a
professional
man
besides
if
he
was
a
publisher
why
did
he
not
publish
something
echo
and
the
publishers
association
no
doubt
answer
why
i
sometimes
think
i
should
like
to
be
a
publisher
myself
it
must
be
rather
nice
to
know
for
a
fact
how
many
copies
and
and
really
do
sell
and
how
many
a
second
large
edition
and
tenth
impression
really
mean
it
must
be
rather
nice
also
to
go
off
to
switzerland
every
year
with
your
wife
to
attend
the
publishers
conference
it
must
be
rather
nice
too
to
know
of
a
surety
that
when
an
author
is
making
money
some
publisher
or
other
is
making
just
as
much
and
not
infrequently
a
trifle
more
on
the
same
work
we
have
learnt
of
late
greatly
to
our
disgust
that
when
a
publisher
dies
rich
he
has
made
his
money
out
of
apollinaris
this
is
hard
on
authors
who
between
ourselves
are
not
by
any
means
bad
people
and
invariably
take
a
kindly
interest
in
their
publishers
welfare
on
the
other
hand
you
must
admit
sir
that
a
publisher
seldom
goes
bankrupt
and
does
not
as
a
rule
sleep
under
his
own
counter
once
i
lent
a
publisher
half
a
crown
he
paid
it
back
the
average
author
would
have
taken
it
as
money
earned
so
that
on
the
whole
i
am
inclined
to
like
publishers
and
to
set
them
down
in
my
tablets
for
useful
persons
to
an
hotel
keeper
my
dear
sir
oft
in
the
stilly
night
my
thoughts
fly
in
your
direction
for
oft
in
the
stilly
night
it
is
my
unfortunate
habit
to
have
uncomfortable
dreams
and
the
worst
of
them
runs
to
bankruptcy
i
have
a
horror
of
bankruptcy
at
any
rate
in
my
dreams
i
sometimes
lie
between
the
blankets
in
a
cold
sweat
and
for
public
examination
as
it
were
and
the
presiding
genius
of
the
court
says
to
me
sepulchrally
to
what
do
you
attribute
your
financial
rottenness
i
fall
into
a
colder
sweat
and
remark
with
a
humility
which
becomes
my
unfortunate
position
sir
if
you
please
i
have
been
living
at
an
hotel
at
this
juncture
of
course
i
come
in
for
every
sympathy
the
court
is
with
me
the
court
has
been
there
itself
there
is
not
a
dry
eye
about
the
place
every
man
present
knows
what
i
mean
and
his
heart
is
touched
accordingly
sir
my
dear
sir
you
also
know
what
i
mean
in
other
words
you
know
that
i
am
the
victim
of
a
convention
and
that
when
all
is
said
that
can
be
said
you
are
the
author
of
that
convention
as
to
the
nature
of
that
convention
we
will
put
it
this
way
one
pound
of
steak
to
the
actual
consumer
should
cost
say
trimmings
in
the
way
of
potatoes
and
peas
might
cost
say
bread
pepper
salt
and
mustard
you
will
notice
that
i
put
a
princely
price
on
everything
total
fifty
per
cent
profit
for
you
let
us
say
would
bring
us
up
to
really
you
ought
to
let
one
off
for
but
what
do
you
do
well
so
far
as
i
can
gather
from
your
bills
you
lie
awake
at
night
debating
with
yourself
whether
you
should
charge
one
or
and
you
usually
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
will
be
best
for
all
parties
concerned
to
charge
one
if
one
expostulates
you
remark
with
hauteur
that
you
thought
you
were
dealing
with
a
gentleman
you
are
quite
correct
in
this
surmise
but
one
pays
and
you
pocket
the
difference
then
again
on
one
bill
you
put
bed
which
is
cheap
and
i
do
not
murmur
but
you
also
put
attendance
coffee
in
bedroom
before
rising
bath
this
is
just
too
much
especially
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
attendance
wears
dirty
shirts
that
the
bath
is
lukewarm
if
you
order
it
cold
and
lukewarm
if
you
order
it
hot
and
that
the
coffee
before
rising
does
cost
you
a
farthing
i
am
aware
of
course
that
all
this
is
very
mean
and
low
down
on
my
part
but
frankly
your
rapacity
matters
not
so
much
to
me
as
to
yourself
people
come
once
to
your
establishment
they
read
your
bill
pay
your
prices
and
tip
your
waiters
and
go
away
forget
to
come
hence
you
are
bound
to
charge
the
next
man
that
comes
along
as
much
extra
as
he
will
stand
and
by
slow
degrees
your
establishment
is
becoming
a
and
a
warning
my
dear
sir
have
a
shilling
bottle
of
wine
for
which
you
charge
me
at
your
own
expense
consult
with
your
wife
and
make
up
your
mind
never
to
charge
more
than
for
worth
of
goods
honesty
is
its
own
reward
it
is
really
to
the
man
with
a
gun
my
dear
sir
i
suppose
you
are
having
an
excellent
time
just
now
there
are
a
large
number
of
counties
in
england
and
scotland
and
i
am
not
acquainted
with
one
of
them
wherein
your
and
puffs
of
smoke
and
men
with
dogs
are
not
to
be
encountered
you
like
it
it
is
very
nice
and
really
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
it
is
what
the
counties
were
made
for
in
the
history
books
they
were
wont
to
say
of
a
certain
norman
monarch
that
he
loved
the
red
deer
as
if
he
were
their
brother
of
you
it
may
safely
be
said
that
you
love
the
red
grouse
and
the
brown
partridge
as
if
you
were
a
poulterer
you
are
a
sportsman
the
man
who
first
went
out
with
a
gun
to
shoot
game
probably
did
it
on
the
sly
had
he
been
caught
he
would
no
doubt
have
been
regarded
by
the
sportsmen
of
his
day
with
the
same
contempt
that
you
yourself
indulge
for
the
unprincipled
blackguard
sir
who
shoots
foxes
but
time
and
the
gunsmiths
have
changed
all
that
and
now
you
are
a
sportsman
a
shooter
of
birds
for
the
london
market
you
are
also
a
gunner
and
you
kill
things
oh
why
do
you
not
go
and
live
at
bad
joke
well
i
know
it
is
but
i
assure
you
my
dear
sir
that
it
is
not
half
so
bad
as
i
can
make
them
when
i
try
to
come
now
to
the
region
of
practical
politics
let
me
explain
to
you
right
off
that
despite
all
that
has
been
said
against
you
by
people
who
are
mad
about
the
land
and
the
and
the
feathered
kingdom
and
so
forth
i
who
am
always
on
the
side
of
wisdom
have
discovered
a
justification
for
you
it
is
this
there
has
been
a
great
demand
of
late
for
really
competent
shots
in
response
to
that
demand
kipling
has
started
a
village
rifle
club
i
understand
that
the
members
thereof
are
let
us
say
five
hundred
in
number
now
i
put
it
to
you
sir
how
many
sportsmen
are
there
shooting
in
this
beautiful
country
and
scotland
well
we
will
not
compute
it
is
dangerous
but
you
could
make
a
fairly
big
rifle
club
out
of
them
they
are
all
good
men
and
of
course
all
beautiful
shots
some
day
when
the
war
is
over
england
may
want
them
will
they
answer
to
the
call
my
dear
sir
you
have
your
uses
go
in
peace
to
the
stock
exchange
its
my
dear
stock
exchange
i
am
given
to
understand
that
you
are
a
hundred
years
old
and
that
therefore
you
will
celebrate
what
nine
men
out
of
every
ten
of
you
call
your
by
taking
a
whole
holiday
instead
of
a
half
one
it
would
be
easy
for
me
my
dear
stock
exchange
to
present
you
with
a
sort
of
illuminated
address
on
this
occasion
but
i
refrain
one
short
year
ago
i
tumbled
into
a
little
money
it
was
not
enough
to
live
upon
but
it
was
a
nice
sum
a
man
introduced
me
to
a
member
of
the
stock
exchange
the
member
of
the
stock
exchange
introduced
me
to
a
little
game
of
in
and
out
and
my
five
hundred
pounds
folded
its
tents
like
the
arabs
that
is
to
say
it
silently
stole
away
it
was
not
the
member
of
the
stock
exchange
fault
certainly
it
was
not
my
fault
and
i
will
not
say
that
it
was
the
fault
of
the
stock
exchange
but
i
am
not
giving
the
stock
exchange
any
illuminated
addresses
at
present
on
the
other
hand
let
me
assure
you
that
i
believe
the
stock
exchange
to
be
a
highly
respectable
honourable
and
useful
institution
it
leaves
the
court
without
a
stain
upon
its
character
i
say
these
latter
things
advisedly
because
some
time
back
a
friend
of
mine
who
writes
articles
on
food
supply
having
delivered
himself
of
the
opinion
that
london
milk
was
largely
water
was
sued
for
slander
by
the
amalgamated
society
of
dairymen
daughters
and
had
to
climb
down
and
apologise
so
that
on
the
whole
i
repeat
that
in
my
humble
opinion
if
you
want
to
find
really
sound
white
men
men
of
spotless
character
and
impregnable
probity
you
can
not
do
better
than
wend
your
way
to
gorgonzola
hall
and
joking
apart
my
dear
stock
exchange
you
really
are
a
blessing
if
it
were
not
for
you
people
with
a
lot
of
money
and
people
with
only
a
little
would
simply
not
lose
it
it
would
lie
in
banks
and
old
stockings
and
kindred
receptacles
till
it
went
mouldy
you
keep
things
going
you
are
the
heart
of
the
monetary
world
you
pump
in
the
gold
you
pump
out
all
that
you
do
happen
to
want
and
you
go
and
live
in
maida
vale
keep
a
butler
drive
two
horses
and
change
your
name
from
manassah
to
howard
this
holiday
of
yours
gives
me
much
pause
supposing
instead
of
taking
a
day
you
were
to
take
a
year
what
would
happen
to
england
she
would
be
ruined
yeth
indeed
to
the
lord
mayor
my
dear
lord
mayor
in
fleet
street
all
is
gay
from
min
office
window
i
catch
glimpses
of
fluttering
bunting
and
swinging
festoons
i
do
know
who
pays
for
them
the
bunting
and
the
festoons
that
is
to
say
but
i
am
informed
by
the
police
that
they
the
bunting
and
the
festoons
that
is
to
say
have
been
hung
up
in
honour
of
you
i
am
also
given
to
understand
that
there
has
been
a
big
rush
for
free
windows
to
view
your
procession
which
all
being
well
the
procession
that
is
to
say
will
take
place
this
day
saturday
for
my
own
part
i
am
going
into
the
country
and
i
dare
say
that
on
the
whole
you
wish
you
were
going
with
me
but
ambition
has
its
penalties
and
if
you
will
become
lord
mayor
of
london
a
dizzy
pinnacle
to
which
none
but
the
of
us
may
aspire
i
suppose
you
must
put
up
with
the
attendant
inconveniences
and
publicity
so
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
judge
and
i
arrive
at
this
conclusion
by
dint
of
steadfast
abstinence
from
witnessing
lord
mayors
shows
a
lord
mayor
show
is
a
distinctly
inspiriting
spectacle
it
may
be
set
down
as
the
londoner
one
annual
opportunity
of
seeing
a
circus
for
nothing
hence
no
doubt
its
popularity
think
not
however
my
dear
lord
mayor
that
i
deprecate
your
little
pageant
gratis
though
it
be
this
country
as
everybody
knows
has
for
centuries
past
been
on
the
high
road
to
ruin
and
in
my
humble
opinion
its
decadence
has
been
largely
due
to
a
tendency
on
the
part
of
the
powerful
to
curtail
and
do
away
with
mayoral
and
other
shows
feasts
and
fairs
have
been
kicked
out
of
england
by
the
aforesaid
powerful
if
you
would
be
a
respectable
community
you
must
have
neither
feast
nor
fair
and
if
you
would
be
a
respectable
citizen
of
any
given
city
you
must
not
array
yourself
in
motley
a
man
who
walked
into
his
bank
in
yellow
trousers
and
a
blue
silk
hat
would
never
be
allowed
an
overdraft
black
and
subdued
greens
and
browns
being
the
only
wear
for
persons
who
would
get
on
in
life
all
this
is
wrong
my
dear
lord
mayor
i
am
of
opinion
that
millionaires
ought
to
wear
purple
breeches
i
see
no
reason
why
i
myself
should
not
have
a
morning
coat
of
red
white
and
blue
or
a
waistcoat
emblazoned
with
the
arms
of
the
worshipful
company
of
spectaclemakers
in
fact
my
dear
lord
mayor
to
perpetrate
a
meynellism
the
colour
of
life
is
the
salt
of
it
just
as
the
lord
mayor
show
is
the
salt
of
the
lord
mayoralty
and
the
one
beautiful
thing
about
life
as
people
expect
you
to
live
it
in
the
metropolis
come
hither
come
hither
my
dear
lord
mayor
and
do
not
tremble
so
we
are
all
glad
to
see
you
going
up
fleet
street
we
are
all
glad
to
see
you
going
home
the
other
way
and
we
shall
be
equally
glad
to
see
your
successor
getting
through
the
same
flowerful
day
work
next
year
goodbye
my
dear
lord
mayor
and
hooray
to
the
motorist
my
dear
sir
when
men
have
nightmares
they
dream
about
you
i
myself
have
been
chased
over
the
tops
of
pinnacles
by
panhards
and
durkopps
in
my
sleep
nor
is
this
all
for
if
one
brings
oneself
to
read
reports
of
the
proceedings
of
police
courts
one
finds
that
the
average
citizen
gets
more
or
less
chased
by
you
sir
in
his
waking
moments
the
police
i
know
sir
seldom
speak
the
truth
they
remember
so
well
the
day
when
a
horseless
carriage
had
to
be
taken
through
the
street
at
the
speed
of
a
funeral
march
and
with
a
red
flag
in
front
of
it
that
the
spectacle
of
an
affable
motorist
bowling
through
a
surrey
village
to
the
tune
of
six
miles
an
hour
shocks
ther
imagination
and
they
believe
for
the
rest
of
their
natural
lives
that
the
affable
motorist
aforesaid
must
have
been
travelling
at
the
rate
of
anything
from
to
miles
per
minute
hence
my
dear
motorist
it
comes
to
pass
that
you
are
afforded
so
many
opportunities
for
airing
your
eloquence
and
the
fatness
of
your
purse
before
the
police
magistrates
in
my
opinion
it
seems
just
possible
that
the
real
trouble
lies
in
the
fact
that
you
my
dear
sir
do
actually
go
through
villages
at
a
very
low
speed
and
that
really
the
best
thing
you
can
do
would
be
to
make
a
point
of
going
through
them
at
the
highest
speed
consistent
with
the
safety
of
your
own
person
for
if
you
did
this
no
policeman
of
my
acquaintance
would
be
able
to
catch
you
hence
you
would
never
be
fined
i
have
been
out
of
sympathy
with
motor
cars
right
up
to
the
other
night
the
other
night
i
had
the
felicity
to
take
a
small
trip
on
one
the
motorist
would
fain
have
driven
me
to
my
house
which
is
half
an
hour
cab
drive
from
charing
cross
he
offered
to
do
the
distance
in
ten
minutes
and
started
stirring
up
his
petroleum
but
i
said
no
let
us
go
to
the
marble
arch
we
went
through
the
mall
to
hyde
park
corner
to
south
kensington
to
paddington
into
the
edgware
road
and
so
to
the
marble
arch
time
at
the
outside
min
i
am
willing
to
admit
that
we
went
down
certain
streets
quite
rapidly
what
time
the
policemen
at
odd
corners
stared
stupidly
and
fumbled
for
their
but
as
a
result
of
that
trip
my
dear
sir
i
have
become
an
enthusiastic
motorist
i
am
convinced
that
speed
and
wind
and
the
smell
of
petroleum
mixed
is
the
only
thing
which
can
be
considered
worth
living
for
and
if
you
happen
to
know
anybody
who
would
be
willing
to
take
a
typewriter
and
a
pair
of
skates
not
much
worn
in
exchange
for
a
durkopp
racer
kindly
communicate
with
me
to
next
christmas
my
dear
next
christmas
it
is
an
excellent
journalistic
thing
not
to
say
a
poetical
thing
to
be
first
in
the
field
behold
me
therefore
advancing
at
the
head
of
that
motley
army
which
will
inevitably
hail
you
when
your
time
comes
for
your
predecessor
my
dear
next
christmas
i
can
not
say
much
he
came
in
with
several
thousand
inches
of
rain
he
went
out
on
a
watery
moon
there
was
turkey
as
usual
pudding
as
usual
mistletoe
as
usual
peace
on
earth
as
usual
there
were
also
the
waits
the
young
folks
the
postman
the
dustman
no
connection
with
the
scavengers
and
the
turncock
we
had
a
merry
day
half
the
world
pretended
to
be
happy
the
other
half
pretended
to
be
bored
the
festivities
i
understand
are
still
being
kept
up
there
is
a
tournament
at
the
queen
hall
and
a
children
banquet
at
the
guildhall
on
tuesday
evening
not
to
mention
dan
leno
at
drury
lane
and
de
wet
at
the
tweefontein
it
is
all
very
cheerful
and
very
inspiriting
all
the
same
let
us
not
repine
christmas
comes
but
once
a
year
and
it
will
come
again
i
fear
this
couplet
of
course
my
dear
next
christmas
is
not
intended
to
be
disrespectful
to
you
it
is
inserted
simply
for
the
sake
of
effect
for
i
never
miss
an
opportunity
of
bursting
into
rhyme
when
the
way
is
plain
before
me
my
dear
next
christmas
do
not
be
discouraged
come
next
year
by
all
means
if
i
said
do
come
you
would
come
just
the
same
therefore
i
say
come
and
i
trust
my
dear
next
christmas
that
when
you
do
come
you
will
bring
us
a
little
luck
ring
out
the
old
as
it
were
and
ring
in
the
new
let
candied
peel
be
a
trifle
cheaper
let
the
war
be
settled
to
the
satisfaction
of
both
parties
let
the
book
trade
flourish
let
the
be
reduced
let
there
be
a
fine
christmas
eve
and
dry
waits
and
a
little
skating
next
morning
let
there
be
peace
and
plenty
a
pocket
full
of
money
and
a
barrel
full
of
beer
and
all
other
good
things
including
a
free
and
enlightened
press
and
a
strong
demand
for
seasonable
poetry
my
dear
next
christmas
here
is
my
hand
with
my
heart
in
it
till
we
meet
again
as
hall
caine
says
addio
to
the
tripper
my
dear
sir
or
madam
when
james
watt
or
some
such
person
had
the
luck
to
see
a
kettle
boil
he
little
dreamed
that
he
was
discovering
you
otherwise
he
would
have
let
his
kettle
boil
for
a
million
million
years
without
saying
anything
about
it
however
james
watt
omitted
to
take
cognisance
of
the
ultimate
trouble
and
here
you
are
and
here
alas
you
will
stay
till
our
iron
roads
are
beaten
into
ploughshares
and
cook
sons
are
at
rest
when
i
was
young
a
single
man
and
after
youthful
follies
ran
which
strange
as
it
may
seem
is
wordsworth
your
goings
to
and
fro
upon
the
earth
and
walkings
up
and
down
thereon
were
limited
by
the
day
trip
for
you
went
to
brighton
or
to
buxton
and
matlock
or
as
the
case
may
be
a
special
tap
of
ale
and
a
special
cut
of
were
put
on
for
your
delectation
you
sang
a
mixture
of
hymns
and
songs
on
your
homeward
journey
and
there
was
an
end
of
the
matter
but
nowadays
there
is
no
escape
from
you
the
trip
that
was
over
and
done
in
hours
at
most
has
become
a
matter
of
saturday
to
monday
at
sunny
saltburn
ten
days
in
lovely
lucerne
and
a
visit
to
the
holy
land
for
ten
guineas
wherever
one
goes
on
this
wide
globe
there
shall
one
find
your
empty
bottle
and
your
old
newspaper
the
devastations
and
maraudings
which
you
once
reserved
for
noblemen
seats
are
now
extended
to
the
rigi
the
bridge
of
sighs
mount
everest
and
the
deserts
of
gobi
and
shamo
indeed
i
question
whether
it
would
be
possible
for
one
to
traverse
the
trackless
forests
of
mexico
or
the
dreary
tundras
of
remote
siberia
or
to
put
one
nose
into
such
an
uncompromising
fastness
as
craig
ell
achaie
which
is
the
last
place
the
canadian
pacific
railway
made
and
which
may
not
be
properly
spelled
without
coming
upon
you
picnicking
in
a
spinny
and
prepared
to
greet
all
and
sundry
with
that
remark
there
or
some
other
equally
objectionable
ribaldry
well
my
dear
tripper
time
is
short
and
poets
fill
their
columns
easily
so
that
i
must
not
abuse
you
any
more
you
are
part
of
the
cosmos
and
as
such
i
am
bound
to
respect
you
but
by
day
and
night
i
wish
that
james
watt
had
taken
no
notice
of
his
boiling
kettle
to
the
glasgow
magistrates
their
proposal
to
banish
may
it
please
your
worships
for
years
past
glasgow
has
stood
in
the
forefront
as
a
city
given
over
to
the
and
magisterial
reform
it
is
i
believe
an
exceedingly
city
in
fact
it
appears
to
be
managed
out
of
all
reasonable
existence
hence
no
doubt
it
comes
to
pass
that
it
was
lately
visited
by
a
smart
sample
of
the
plague
i
have
not
the
smallest
doubt
that
your
worships
are
sincere
and
men
i
believe
that
you
do
what
you
do
do
so
to
speak
out
of
sheer
public
spirit
and
with
a
view
to
bettering
the
condition
of
the
city
over
which
you
preside
in
other
words
i
impute
no
motives
that
is
to
say
no
base
motives
but
my
dear
worships
why
in
the
name
of
heaven
would
you
abolish
the
harmless
necessary
barmaid
have
you
never
been
young
have
you
never
known
the
tender
delight
of
whiling
away
a
morning
with
your
elbow
on
the
zinc
and
threepennyworth
of
bass
before
you
what
may
i
ask
your
worships
is
bass
without
a
barmaid
i
grant
that
taking
them
all
in
all
the
barmaids
of
scotland
are
not
what
you
might
term
an
altogether
bewitching
lot
years
ago
when
i
was
young
and
callow
fate
threw
me
into
the
propinquity
of
a
lady
of
this
ilk
she
hailed
from
glasgow
and
she
was
not
beautiful
on
the
other
hand
i
was
young
and
out
of
an
income
which
was
even
slenderer
then
than
it
is
now
i
purchased
for
that
dear
lady
of
the
north
many
bottles
of
perfume
many
pairs
of
kid
gloves
and
a
prayer
book
or
so
and
when
i
had
consumed
innumerable
basses
at
her
altar
and
the
time
had
as
i
thought
become
ripe
i
offered
her
matrimony
to
which
she
replied
in
limpid
doric
gang
awa
hame
to
yer
mither
that
my
dear
worships
is
glasgow
if
you
can
weed
out
of
glasgow
all
young
females
possessed
of
this
particular
kind
of
temperament
i
am
not
so
sure
but
that
you
would
have
my
blessing
on
the
other
hand
i
am
free
to
admit
that
i
hae
my
doots
as
to
your
capacity
for
so
doing
the
the
kid
gloves
the
prayer
book
and
na
na
na
i
winna
will
always
remain
the
prerogatives
of
the
glasgae
lassies
if
i
know
anything
of
them
also
my
dear
worships
one
thing
is
absolutely
certain
that
if
the
magistrates
of
all
the
cities
in
the
united
kingdom
would
take
the
step
you
have
taken
we
should
have
gone
a
very
considerable
way
towards
solving
the
drink
problem
and
putting
sir
michael
into
a
fearful
hole
for
money
i
hate
scotch
men
but
i
sometimes
think
that
scotch
women
are
rather
bonnie
to
a
bookseller
my
dear
sir
there
lies
a
vale
in
ida
lovelier
than
all
the
valleys
of
ionian
hills
i
take
it
that
this
is
a
geographical
fact
anyway
it
is
tennyson
and
i
quote
it
in
order
that
you
may
perceive
that
i
have
some
acquaintance
with
the
higher
walks
of
literature
and
am
therefore
a
man
of
entirely
different
build
from
yourself
i
was
born
a
poet
and
have
stuck
to
my
trade
unto
this
last
possibly
you
were
born
a
bookseller
i
am
willing
to
give
your
credit
for
it
but
i
doubt
it
all
the
same
for
i
often
think
the
average
bookseller
must
have
been
born
a
draper
the
other
day
i
had
occasion
to
do
a
little
it
was
my
first
essay
in
what
i
now
believe
to
be
an
altogether
elegant
and
delightful
form
of
intellectual
recreation
of
course
i
went
into
a
shop
from
the
yawning
cimmerianity
at
the
back
of
that
shop
there
came
unto
me
swiftly
and
in
large
boots
a
fat
youth
he
bowed
and
he
bowed
and
he
bowed
i
want
a
good
edition
of
shelley
i
said
and
he
replied
straightway
stepthisway
i
said
thank
you
but
i
want
shelley
not
whereat
he
smiled
and
banged
under
my
nose
a
heavy
volume
bound
like
a
cheap
purse
and
murmured
there
you
are
the
best
line
in
the
market
and
because
i
opened
it
and
looked
disconsolately
at
the
stodgy
and
the
entrancing
border
he
cast
upon
me
eyes
of
contempt
and
disgust
and
told
me
that
i
could
not
expect
kelmscott
press
and
at
the
money
in
fact
that
fat
youth
annoyed
me
he
was
a
bookseller
ah
my
dear
sir
when
i
reflect
that
whatever
i
may
write
no
matter
how
excellent
it
may
be
must
ultimately
pass
into
the
hands
of
that
fat
youth
and
become
to
him
something
at
andkindlystepthisway
the
spirit
of
my
fathers
quails
within
me
i
know
that
authorship
is
a
trade
for
fools
go
to
ninepence
me
no
ninepences
me
no
nets
bring
yourself
at
once
to
your
logical
conclusion
and
next
time
i
call
upon
you
for
shelley
sell
him
to
me
as
you
appear
to
sell
temporal
power
by
the
pound
avoirdupois
to
the
deceased
wife
sister
my
dear
deceased
wife
sister
the
wife
of
my
bosom
being
still
happily
amongst
us
the
above
as
the
learned
might
say
is
a
misnomer
you
on
the
other
hand
are
a
miss
and
i
would
not
marry
you
to
save
myself
from
boiling
oil
if
i
had
wanted
you
i
could
have
had
you
in
the
beginning
and
if
i
had
married
you
the
wife
of
my
bosom
would
have
been
aunt
to
her
own
children
as
it
were
and
in
the
event
of
your
demise
she
would
also
have
been
my
deceased
wife
sister
which
is
at
once
inconsequential
and
peculiar
a
man
can
not
marry
his
deceased
wife
sister
till
she
is
dead
this
is
quite
wrong
in
my
humble
opinion
it
is
also
quite
right
anyway
we
will
close
this
parenthesis
with
the
usual
sign
and
proceed
along
the
primrose
path
of
business
as
i
have
already
remarked
in
my
usual
quaint
way
a
man
can
not
marry
his
deceased
wife
sister
until
she
is
dead
by
she
of
course
i
mean
the
man
wife
the
bishops
declare
that
he
can
not
marry
her
anyhow
by
he
i
mean
the
man
and
by
her
of
course
the
bishops
mean
the
man
deceased
wife
sister
i
desire
to
be
explicit
on
these
points
in
order
that
we
may
avoid
ambiguity
well
my
dear
deceased
wife
sister
always
remembering
that
is
still
alive
what
is
your
view
of
matters
do
you
really
wish
to
marry
me
or
not
have
you
any
opinions
about
lord
hugh
cecil
if
so
kindly
state
them
was
he
or
was
he
not
justified
in
demanding
on
wednesday
night
that
the
word
shame
be
put
upon
the
record
if
so
why
not
if
not
why
so
my
dear
deceased
wife
sister
do
not
let
us
get
confused
let
us
clear
our
minds
of
cecil
after
all
is
said
you
are
the
auntie
of
my
children
and
the
of
my
wife
not
to
say
the
of
my
children
father
come
along
here
are
ducats
a
ring
and
a
canadian
parson
let
us
get
married
at
once
of
course
it
is
so
sudden
it
always
is
and
we
have
forgotten
about
we
always
do
but
i
tell
you
here
and
now
and
in
good
set
terms
my
dear
deceased
wife
sister
that
if
i
wish
to
marry
either
you
or
any
more
of
your
mother
daughters
which
heaven
forbid
i
shall
go
to
canada
or
australia
and
marry
to
the
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
his
my
dear
sir
michael
the
devotion
of
one
life
to
the
service
of
the
muses
and
the
neglect
of
golden
opportunities
is
not
without
its
compensations
one
of
the
chief
of
them
being
that
the
devotee
can
look
into
the
eyes
of
the
most
rapacious
of
chancellors
of
the
exchequer
and
smile
for
my
own
part
dear
sir
michael
by
the
writing
of
odes
and
general
inattention
to
business
i
am
able
to
knock
up
a
precarious
one
hundred
and
pounds
per
annum
on
one
hundred
and
sixty
pounds
of
that
sum
i
am
always
careful
to
claim
exemption
which
leaves
a
taxable
balance
of
fifteen
pounds
out
of
this
balance
my
dear
old
friend
you
are
welcome
to
take
fifteen
shillings
or
and
fourpence
or
and
sixpence
farthing
or
any
other
sum
that
you
think
might
come
in
handy
indeed
in
all
the
circumstances
and
without
prejudice
i
should
not
be
greatly
upset
if
you
took
the
lot
for
well
i
wot
that
the
late
war
has
cost
more
than
the
price
of
a
row
of
houses
and
that
it
is
my
duty
as
a
patriot
to
pay
and
pay
cheerfully
and
particularly
so
since
it
is
not
due
for
a
month
or
so
ah
my
dear
chancellor
who
fears
black
michael
must
himself
be
black
they
call
you
black
because
you
want
a
lot
of
money
i
call
them
black
because
they
got
it
however
this
is
not
a
ruskinian
oration
but
an
ode
and
i
shall
therefore
proceed
to
give
you
a
few
tips
as
to
legitimate
methods
of
raising
the
wind
judging
by
your
recent
efforts
you
appear
to
be
short
of
ideas
here
you
are
put
sixpence
a
hundred
on
cigars
see
what
you
save
will
see
me
through
somehow
besides
i
never
smoke
cigars
put
a
bit
more
on
all
sorts
of
wines
and
liqueurs
excepting
sauterne
and
benedictine
of
which
i
am
particularly
fond
put
a
bit
more
on
beer
and
sixpence
a
pound
on
arsenic
as
a
rule
i
do
not
take
either
tax
railway
tickets
i
invariably
travel
on
passes
tax
perambulators
my
sons
and
heirs
can
all
walk
tax
like
the
omar
khayyam
club
i
never
advertise
tax
bicycles
i
abhor
exertion
tax
gold
and
gem
jewellery
i
never
keep
it
tax
fiction
and
fourth
enormous
editions
we
shall
then
hear
less
about
them
abolish
the
free
i
invariably
begin
the
day
with
lunch
also
tax
i
am
not
the
duke
of
bedford
and
seize
all
the
unclaimed
bank
balances
none
of
which
by
any
possibility
can
be
mine
in
fact
my
dear
sir
michael
tax
and
seize
whatever
you
like
the
opulent
and
the
not
to
mention
the
rascally
working
classes
will
have
to
put
up
with
it
to
the
common
golfer
my
dear
common
golfer
the
game
you
affect
is
a
great
game
played
by
yourself
and
all
the
crowned
heads
of
europe
not
to
mention
all
the
fat
persons
who
desire
to
bant
all
the
thin
persons
who
desire
to
become
vigorous
and
muscular
as
it
were
all
the
clerks
who
desire
to
pass
for
dukes
and
all
the
dukes
who
relish
the
society
of
clerks
it
is
a
great
game
the
people
who
play
it
are
not
the
fault
of
the
game
it
is
also
a
good
game
if
i
am
not
mistaken
it
is
a
game
that
originally
came
out
of
scotland
therefore
it
must
be
a
good
game
for
everything
that
comes
out
of
scotland
is
good
even
the
scot
and
golf
being
a
great
and
good
game
i
do
not
see
any
tremendous
reason
why
you
my
dear
common
golfer
should
not
engage
in
it
if
you
so
choose
on
the
other
hand
i
wish
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
that
you
did
not
engage
in
it
i
know
a
bank
whereon
the
wild
thyme
blows
or
ought
to
blow
oft
of
a
pleasant
summer
morn
have
i
taken
a
cheap
ticket
to
a
station
which
is
not
far
from
that
bank
and
there
on
the
bank
that
is
to
say
reclined
me
what
time
i
looked
up
into
the
blue
dome
and
watched
the
clouds
and
flicked
away
the
midges
and
wished
my
name
was
corydon
and
remembered
bits
of
keats
and
bits
of
herrick
and
bits
of
business
and
so
forth
oft
i
say
have
i
done
these
things
but
of
late
i
no
longer
do
them
inasmuch
as
my
bank
has
become
if
i
may
so
term
it
the
other
day
i
repaired
to
the
said
bank
on
rural
musings
bent
what
did
i
find
why
my
dear
old
thymy
bank
was
in
the
possession
of
half
a
dozen
gross
fellows
in
red
coats
thy
had
pipes
in
their
mouths
and
a
jar
of
beer
in
their
midst
and
they
were
actually
talking
and
laughing
in
the
most
uproarious
fashion
i
heard
one
of
them
say
why
did
arthur
and
the
others
thought
hard
and
trifled
with
their
brassies
and
things
and
could
not
make
answer
o
my
dear
common
golfer
were
of
that
party
you
you
are
always
of
such
parties
you
are
always
sitting
on
other
people
thymy
banks
and
saying
why
did
and
depleting
village
of
good
beer
and
turning
whole
village
populations
into
caddies
and
dotting
the
landscape
with
your
red
coats
and
generally
appropriating
the
fair
face
of
nature
i
can
not
stop
you
my
dear
common
golfer
i
can
not
o
i
can
not
would
that
i
could
o
would
that
i
could
in
which
case
perhaps
i
would
no
my
dear
boy
rural
england
is
yours
also
the
take
them
old
man
take
them
i
hand
them
over
to
you
with
the
best
heart
in
the
world
take
them
they
are
yours
and
excuse
these
tears
to
pierpont
morgan
dear
pierpont
morgan
i
hasten
to
give
you
a
hearty
british
welcome
come
to
my
arms
i
am
in
the
trust
line
myself
that
is
to
say
i
used
to
be
before
people
started
putting
up
announcements
to
the
effect
that
poor
trust
is
dead
bad
pay
killed
him
some
day
an
i
mistake
not
morgan
your
trust
will
die
all
trusts
are
grass
ponder
it
i
am
a
political
economist
and
i
know
meanwhile
i
am
very
pleased
to
think
that
we
have
amongst
us
a
man
of
your
financial
prowess
and
purchasing
power
there
is
a
certain
class
of
british
person
who
apparently
goes
in
bodily
fear
of
you
that
class
of
person
has
groaned
loudly
over
your
steel
exploit
and
he
has
groaned
loudlier
still
over
your
purchase
of
the
leyland
line
of
steamships
to
groan
over
a
fair
deal
of
any
kind
appears
to
me
my
dear
pierpont
morgan
to
be
an
entirely
stupid
proceeding
nobody
can
come
to
grief
by
selling
things
providing
they
sell
them
at
the
right
price
you
have
bought
the
leyland
line
of
steamships
i
see
no
reason
why
you
should
not
buy
all
the
other
lines
if
you
want
them
and
have
the
wherewithal
to
pay
for
them
for
in
the
long
run
everything
comes
to
him
who
vends
you
buy
my
steamships
or
my
steelworks
or
for
that
matter
my
caller
herrin
i
take
your
money
i
put
it
in
your
bank
and
live
sumptuously
on
the
interest
you
have
all
the
trouble
inasmuch
as
you
have
to
rake
up
the
interest
i
sit
at
home
and
enjoy
myself
you
scheme
and
scheme
and
scheme
and
scheme
and
scheme
and
scheme
and
scheme
i
am
happy
i
hope
you
are
between
ourselves
i
should
not
tremble
if
you
bought
up
great
britain
and
ireland
especially
ireland
and
all
that
in
them
is
providing
always
as
i
have
said
before
that
you
paid
the
price
indeed
i
hope
to
live
to
see
the
day
when
englishmen
will
cease
to
toil
and
spin
and
derive
their
incomes
wholly
and
solely
from
american
dividends
fools
buy
things
my
dear
pierpont
morgan
wise
men
sell
them
that
is
particularly
true
when
the
article
involved
happens
to
be
poetry
nevertheless
as
you
appear
to
be
in
a
buying
frame
of
mind
i
take
this
opportunity
of
informing
you
that
i
have
at
my
villa
at
hindhead
a
large
and
varied
stock
of
sonnets
odes
rhymes
jingles
and
what
not
which
i
am
prepared
to
sell
at
an
enormous
sacrifice
my
price
to
you
for
the
lot
would
be
fifteen
million
dollars
if
you
care
to
deal
i
undertake
to
melt
your
cheque
at
your
own
bank
and
to
invest
the
proceeds
in
any
concerns
in
which
you
happen
to
be
interested
so
that
you
would
not
only
get
the
poetry
but
also
your
money
back
again
this
at
any
rate
is
how
it
seems
to
me
vale
to
prince
edward
of
york
the
return
of
the
ophir
most
little
prince
as
the
small
boy
who
will
one
day
be
the
sovereign
lord
of
certain
other
small
boys
in
whom
i
am
interested
i
hasten
to
assure
you
of
my
loyalty
to
the
imperial
house
of
which
you
are
the
joy
and
hope
and
of
my
respect
for
your
own
podgy
little
person
i
need
scarcely
tell
you
my
dear
little
prince
is
a
very
big
day
for
you
inasmuch
as
your
excellent
parents
their
royal
highnesses
the
duke
and
duchess
of
cornwall
and
york
return
from
their
wanderings
laden
i
am
given
to
understand
with
presents
for
his
royal
highness
prince
edward
of
york
who
i
am
given
to
understand
has
been
a
very
good
boy
during
these
long
weeks
of
separation
i
am
quite
sure
that
you
deserve
these
presents
and
that
your
grandmama
will
be
able
to
give
your
parents
a
very
good
account
of
you
and
that
your
grandpapa
with
that
tact
which
is
only
one
of
many
of
his
excellent
qualities
will
refrain
from
making
reports
which
might
lead
to
parental
chastisement
i
remember
quite
well
that
when
my
own
mama
and
papa
returned
once
from
a
little
jaunt
they
brought
back
with
them
as
a
present
for
me
a
tin
cylinder
with
a
spike
to
it
which
you
set
on
a
piece
of
wood
and
spun
round
then
you
looked
through
some
holes
in
the
tin
cylinder
and
beheld
many
wonderful
things
such
as
a
little
girl
skipping
and
jockeys
riding
a
steeplechase
on
tigers
if
your
papa
my
dear
little
prince
has
not
brought
you
one
of
those
be
sure
you
ask
for
it
it
is
not
rude
to
ask
for
what
you
do
not
see
in
the
window
providing
you
say
please
and
now
before
i
go
let
me
add
a
few
words
of
kindly
admonition
i
hope
you
will
grow
up
to
be
a
good
and
great
man
and
that
you
will
never
give
your
parents
cause
for
sorrow
by
turning
socialist
or
newspaper
editor
or
attempting
to
imitate
these
odes
to
your
infant
mind
this
last
crime
may
appear
to
be
the
most
innocent
in
the
world
because
these
odes
god
wot
are
so
easy
to
imitate
diplomats
members
of
parliament
publishers
assistants
cabmen
poets
peers
of
the
realm
nay
even
the
very
crowned
heads
of
europe
have
at
time
and
time
been
consumed
with
a
desire
to
do
them
for
me
because
as
i
have
said
it
is
so
easy
well
my
dear
little
prince
let
us
draw
our
moral
the
easy
thing
is
not
always
the
wisest
thing
i
feel
that
in
my
inmost
heart
and
if
you
blossom
into
manhood
with
the
same
conviction
more
or
less
i
make
no
doubt
whatever
that
you
will
be
an
immense
success
as
a
king
i
wish
you
the
best
of
luck
to
mme
bernhardt
my
dear
madame
bernhardt
i
have
been
very
nigh
addressing
this
ode
to
the
winner
of
the
derby
but
on
second
thoughts
i
said
no
no
never
non
in
fact
not
while
we
have
in
our
midst
one
of
whom
i
wot
for
is
it
meet
that
the
charming
mme
bernhardt
should
return
to
her
interesting
country
possessed
of
the
impression
that
the
have
a
greater
feeling
for
than
for
the
or
whatever
you
call
a
thousand
times
ah
madame
believe
me
i
love
my
country
patrie
la
patrie
la
you
know
it
is
a
fine
country
when
you
understand
it
and
i
would
have
my
beautiful
bernhardt
take
away
with
her
nothing
but
splendid
memories
of
it
i
was
exceedingly
glad
to
read
in
the
papers
the
other
morning
that
in
the
opinion
of
the
dramatiques
or
whatever
you
call
madame
had
done
herself
proud
at
the
lyceum
theatre
the
other
evening
one
dramatique
or
whatever
you
call
him
wrote
of
madame
thus
such
passages
wherein
the
eaglet
is
borne
away
on
a
flight
of
adoration
for
the
dead
eagle
recur
throughout
the
play
they
are
in
fact
its
keynote
and
mme
bernhardt
declaimed
them
with
superb
intensity
the
famous
voice
has
lost
its
golden
notes
but
its
power
to
thrill
remains
she
runs
the
gamut
of
the
emotions
with
all
the
grace
and
dexterity
of
a
professor
madame
bernhardt
you
will
perceive
that
the
dramatiques
or
whatever
you
call
write
of
nobody
that
they
do
not
adorn
my
beautiful
you
are
a
made
woman
you
have
all
the
grace
and
dexterity
of
a
professor
o
happiness
o
crown
and
fulfilment
of
a
devoted
to
your
cup
my
quenchless
one
is
at
length
heaped
up
like
benjamin
and
it
runs
over
heaven
bless
us
all
and
in
conclusion
my
dear
mme
bernhardt
will
you
do
me
the
honour
to
allow
me
to
explain
that
in
the
event
of
any
young
enthusiast
from
paris
calling
round
at
any
of
our
newspaper
offices
with
a
view
to
getting
satisfaction
from
the
person
who
accuses
you
of
having
all
the
skill
and
dexterity
of
a
professor
he
the
young
enthusiast
from
paris
will
do
himself
no
good
because
in
my
dear
country
dear
madame
bernhardt
we
do
not
fight
the
duel
la
cut
like
gentlemen
we
merely
throw
downstairs
to
sir
william
harcourt
my
dear
sir
william
harcourt
i
have
not
time
to
get
up
your
other
distinguished
names
so
that
you
must
please
excuse
the
plain
sir
william
my
dear
sir
william

you
ever
survey
the
liberal
party
from
china
to
peru
and
from
rosebery
to
as
it
were
do
you
my
dear
sir
william
o
do
you
do
sometimes
i
do
sir
william
i
do
indeed
o
i
do
and
what
is
the
conclusion
i
come
to
my
dear
sir
william
ah
what
o
what
what
what
what
what
what
what
what
what
what
shall
i
tell
you
my
dear
sir
william
you
are
sure
you
wo
be
offended
if
i
do
and
it
will
be
strictly
between
ourselves
now
wo
it
well
then
come
hither
coz
put
your
sweet
hand
in
mine
and
trust
in
me
and
do
not
construe
my
kindness
into
cruelty
harken
my
dear
sir
william
harken
harken
harken
harken
harken
har
court
the
liberal
party
is
an
unweeded
garden
choked
with
a
myriad
strange
growths
and
a
sad
fierce
baffled
thing
to
look
upon
and
in
its
midst
there
sits
down
perennially
a
huge
and
ponderous
and
unwieldy
ruminant
whom
merely
for
the
sake
of
talking
my
dear
sir
william
we
will
call
the
harcourt
here
when
it
is
not
at
its
lordly
which
men
call
malwood
the
harcourt
as
i
say
sits
down
goodman
bannerman
cometh
to
his
liberal
garden
to
gather
him
a
posy
and
do
a
little
weeding
the
harcourt
is
there
heavily
chewing
the
cud
and
it
takes
the
heart
out
of
goodman
bannerman
to
behold
him
goodman
asquith
had
fain
pick
a
bit
of
dinner
in
the
precincts
the
harcourt
watcheth
him
with
rolling
eye
and
goodman
asquith
shivereth
and
by
and
by
cometh
the
simple
rural
rosebery
armed
with
a
being
rural
he
understands
gardening
he
looks
over
the
wall
and
sayeth
gadzooks
when
folk
tell
me
that
i
am
the
man
to
put
this
garden
to
rights
they
speak
a
mortal
deal
o
truth
i
will
go
in
and
delve
a
bit
and
then
he
beholdeth
the
harcourt
luxuriating
with
his
back
against
the
biggest
fig
tree
and
he
sayeth
no
that
powerful
big
animal
be
there
still
and
i
i
do
i
and
who
shall
blame
him
what
jobbing
gardener
of
any
would
undertake
to
do
up
my
genariums
and
fuchers
if
i
had
a
wild
rhinoceros
gambolling
upon
them
day
in
and
day
out
i
should
have
great
difficulty
in
finding
such
a
jobbing
gardener
my
dear
sir
william
and
to
come
at
once
to
the
plain
poetry
so
belovèd
of
this
age
let
me
tell
you
my
dear
sir
william
that
in
my
opinion
you
and
no
other
are
at
the
present
juncture
the
real
trouble
and
incubus
of
the
party
you
love
if
you
would
only
go
home
and
crown
yourself
with
a
laurel
or
two
and
read
history
books
and
take
tea
with
bishops
and
not
come
back
again
i
believe
the
liberal
party
would
begin
to
get
along
like
a
house
afire
will
you
not
try
it
my
dear
sir
william
oh
will
you
not
try
it
for
who
would
fardels
bear
and
flounder
round
when
he
might
sit
with
lulu
on
the
lawn
and
leave
his
party
for
his
party
good
to
the
king
bulldog
dear
brindle
possibly
your
name
is
not
brindle
but
that
is
of
no
consequence
the
great
point
my
dear
brindle
being
that
when
his
majesty
edward
vii
landed
at
flushing
the
other
day
he
was
accompanied
by
you
at
least
so
i
gather
from
the
halfpenny
papers
and
i
am
free
to
admit
that
when
i
read
the
paragraph
descriptive
of
your
landing
at
flushing
my
bosom
swelled
with
honest
pride
i
am
not
a
doggy
man
myself
dear
brindle
and
no
judge
of
points
also
when
i
see
a
dog
coming
towards
me
i
invariably
whisper
bite
and
consequently
my
hair
is
apt
to
stand
on
end
like
quills
upon
the
fretful
porcupine
at
pretty
well
every
canine
approach
bulldogs
especially
affright
me
so
that
i
can
well
understand
how
the
little
foreign
boy
assembled
at
flushing
to
scoff
in
his
sleeve
at
the
english
king
remained
to
flee
as
it
were
at
the
sight
of
you
that
in
a
nutshell
is
why
my
bosom
swelled
when
i
read
the
paragraph
to
which
previous
reference
has
been
made
it
was
a
picturesque
circumstance
my
dear
brindle
and
may
be
taken
as
one
more
illustration
of
his
majesty
determination
pray
excuse
the
rhyme
to
do
things
as
a
king
of
england
should
to
have
alighted
at
flushing
accompanied
by
a
lion
would
have
been
a
little
outré
and
unicorns
we
know
are
not
obtainable
what
does
his
majesty
do
why
he
takes
as
he
always
has
taken
the
middle
and
dignified
course
he
disjects
himself
on
flushing
with
you
by
his
side
next
to
the
lion
and
the
unicorn
the
bulldog
may
be
reckoned
the
truest
exemplar
and
symbol
of
our
great
nation
it
is
like
this
the
bulldog
is
not
too
beautiful
neither
is
our
great
nation
but
he
frightens
people
so
do
we
he
is
tenacious
and
magnanimous
which
is
just
our
game
he
fears
no
foe
in
shining
armour
or
any
other
sort
of
armour
that
is
precisely
our
case
and
he
is
kept
by
lord

nation
my
dear
brindle
is
not
a
policeman
but
a
bulldog
to
the
my
dear
daily
mail
you
attain
your
number
which
for
the
sake
of
talking
we
will
call
your
jubilee
congratulations
my
dear
congratulations
there
are
people
in
the
world
who
in
the
time
of
your
infancy
gave
you
the
usual
three
months
most
new
papers
get
three
months
on
the
day
of
their
birth
for
at
the
sight
of
a
new
sheet
your
wise
man
invariably
taps
his
nose
looks
even
wiser
than
is
his
wont
and
says
my
dear
sir
i
give
it
three
months
well
my
dear
you
have
survived
the
sentence
of
the
wise
and
i
am
given
to
understand
that
you
have
long
been
a
tremendous
property
once
again
congratulations
but
these
buts
are
fearful
things
are
they
not
but
pray
excuse
me
if
i
appear
to
say
but
again
but
well
you
know
what
i
mean
do
you
let
me
put
it
this
way
when
i
come
to
town
of
a
morning
per
or
potromelitan
railway
as
the
case
may
be
what
do
i
see
not
to
put
too
fine
a
point
upon
it
i
see
a
row
of
silk
or
straw
hats
according
to
the
state
of
the
weather
and
i
see
a
row
of
choice
trouserings
and
between
the
hats
and
the
trouserings
there
is
spread
a
row
of
rustling
morning
papers
i
can
tell
you
the
names
of
those
papers
with
my
eyes
shut
five
out
of
six
of
them
is
called
the
this
upsets
me
it
is
all
right
for
you
of
course
but
it
distresses
me
and
i
do
not
like
being
distressed
now
why
does
it
distress
me
shall
i
tell
you
are
you
sure
that
you
could
bear
the
blow
can
you
pull
yourself
together
for
a
moment
very
well
then
you
distress
me
because
the
price
of
you
is
one
halfpenny
i
am
of
opinion
that
in
the
present
condition
of
the
general
purse
things
which
are
sold
for
a
halfpenny
are
really
too
cheap
i
will
give
you
my
reasons
some
other
day
meanwhile
to
take
your
own
case
when
i
look
into
your
pages
which
is
seldom
what
do
i
find
i
will
be
frank
for
the
second
time
and
tell
you
i
find
my
dear
writ
in
every
line
of
you
from
the
front
page
personal
column
with
its
massa
me
nebber
leab
you
while
you
keep
toffee
about
to
the
last
line
of
your
astonishing
magazine
page
you
are
all
the
time
of
course
there
is
no
harm
in
that
especially
as
you
get
the
and
far
be
it
from
me
to
contemn
you
for
it
on
the
other
hand
as
i
have
remarked
previously
i
do
not
like
it
i
have
no
advice
to
offer
you
inasmuch
as
i
do
not
see
how
you
can
help
yourself
but
i
shall
ask
you
kindly
to
note
that
the
congratulations
expressed
at
the
beginning
of
this
poem
bear
reference
to
your
attainment
of
your
number
and
not
to
another
matter
which
while
you
certainly
have
the
right
upon
your
side
you
appear
to
me
to
be
conducting
in
an
unmitigated
way
to
everybody
my
dear
everybody
the
other
day
i
lunched
at
a
place
where
there
was
a
pretty
lady
during
the
course
of
the
talk
the
pretty
lady
said
to
me
you
see
everybody
is
out
of
town
at
present
i
said
who
is
everybody
whereupon
the
pretty
lady
replied
well
er
everybody
i
said
quite
so
but
do
you
think
it
is
rather
fortunate
that
everybody
is
out
of
town
and
the
pretty
lady
answered
and
said
no
i
conclude
therefore
that
you
everybody
must
on
the
whole
be
rather
nice
i
hope
you
are
for
everybody
should
be
rather
nice
should
they
not
and
when
i
come
to
think
of
it
the
circumstance
that
i
heard
of
you
the
other
day
has
nothing
prodigiously
unusual
about
it
really
and
truly
one
is
always
hearing
about
you
one
is
believe
me
for
example
the
paragraph
writers
assure
me
that
everybody
is
reading
miss
great
novel
also
that
everybody
will
join
with
them
in
congratulating
miss
on
her
approaching
marriage
also
that
everybody
is
in
the
highlands
that
everybody
anticipates
a
good
season
that
everybody
keeps
a
houseboat
that
everybody
sups
at
the
carlton
after
the
theatre
that
everybody
recognises
in
lord
salisbury
a
great
statesman
that
everybody
plays
golf
that
everybody
who
can
afford
it
dresses
well
that
everybody
knows
the
king
has
tact
that
everybody
thinks
the
queen
grows
younger
as
she
grows
older
that
everybody
hopes
sir
thomas
lipton
will
win
the
america
cup
and
so
on
which
is
well
i
do
mind
in
the
least
why
should
i
yet
if
i
were
everybody
i
imagine
that
i
should
not
do
things
quite
in
the
same
way
that
you
do
them
to
my
mind
your
great
defect
is
that
you
do
things
not
because
you
like
to
do
them
but
simply
because
everybody
does
them
this
is
an
excellent
reason
from
your
point
of
view
but
to
me
it
seems
a
trifle
stupid
who
is
reading
miss
book
everybody
why
are
they
reading
it
because
everybody
is
reading
it
do
they
like
miss
book
they
are
not
quite
sure
but
everybody
says
it
is
good
and
therefore
everybody
must
read
it
why
are
worn
because
everybody
wears
them
why
does
everybody
wear
them
because
everybody
wears
them
why
does
everybody
dine
at
a
certain
restaurant
because
everybody
dines
there
why
does
everybody
dine
there
because
everybody
dines
there
why
does
but
there
i
forbear
did
time
allow
i
might
multiply
instances
till
everybody
felt
bored
but
i
stay
min
hand
enough
you
know
is
as
good
as
a
feast
likewise
better
a
stalled
ox
than
a
dinner
of
herbs
everybody
says
so
wherefore
i
am
constrained
to
believe
it
by
way
of
conclusion
let
us
ask
ourselves
what
is
happening
just
now
everybody
says
that
nothing
is
happening
just
now
and
that
everything
is
frightfully
dull
and
everybody
is
quite
right
