with
uplifted

doth
speak

his

rapture
how
sublime

must
bear

our

to
bring
redemption

whereby
adown
the

is
borne
there
comes
the
angel
of
the
lilied
rod

though
our
souls
with
anguish
sore
are
torn
we
pray
once

the
prayer

unchanged

presences
through
which
they
grope
blind

to

there
lies
sublime
effulgence

lift
this
strangeness
which

her
human
heart
to
breaking
we

in

immortal
joy
the
kiss
of

lips

comforts
thrill

thy

soon
what
fateful
shadows
rise
like
night
foretold
in
some
sweet
woodland
glass
on
tender
feet
that
scarcely
bow
the
grass
what
stains
are
those
of
ripe
pomegranate
dyes
when
on
my
breast
thy
head
in
slumber
lies
what
thorns
are
those
that
through
my
heart
do
pass
and
round
about
these
crowds
of
haunting
forms
that
burn
their
splendor
through
my
dimmest
dreams
o
little
child
thou
wonder
too
divine
thy
precious
body
all
my
bosom
warms
with
mine
own
blood
but
oftentimes
it
seems
too
dearly
loved
that
yet
thou
art
not
mine

on
tender
cheek

the
upturned
eyes
with
loving
certainty
seek
ever
the
grave
face
where
broodingly
the
by
yearning
love
opprest
with
wings
seems
folded
the
nest
where
lies
the
hope
of
all
humanity

his

calvary

wraps
her
round
with
all
the
mystery

ones

comforted

fain
would

hast
