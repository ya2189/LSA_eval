a
biographical
note
on
francis
thompson
francis
thompson
a
poet
of
high
thinking
of
celestial
vision
and
of
imaginings
that
found
literary
images
of
answering
splendour
died
in
london
in
the
winter
of
his
life
always
a
fragile
one
doubtless
owed
its
prolongation
to
man
unconquerable
mind
in
him
so
invincible
through
all
vicissitude
that
he
seemed
to
add
a
new
significance
to
wordsworth
phrase
to
his
mortal
frame
was
denied
the
vitality
that
informs
his
verse
howbeit
his
verse
was
himself
he
lived
every
line
of
it
fulfilling
to
the
last
letter
his
own
description
of
the
poet
piteous
yet
proud
he
lives
detachèd
days
he
serveth
not
for
praise
for
gold
he
is
not
sold
he
asketh
not
world
eyes
nor
to
world
ears
he
cries
saith
these
shut
if
ye
please
to
this
aloof
moth
of
a
man
science
was
nearly
as
absorbing
an
interest
as
was
the
mysticism
that
some
thought
had
eaten
him
up
and
to
give
a
light
example
of
his
actuality
he
who
had
scarce
handled
a
bat
since
he
left
ushaw
college
knew
every
famous
score
of
the
last
quarter
of
a
century
and
left
among
his
papers
trivial
yet
tragic
one
such
verse
acquaints
us
incidentally
with
his
lancashire
lineage
it
is
little
i
repair
to
the
matches
of
the
southron
folk
though
my
own
red
roses
there
may
blow
it
is
little
i
repair
to
the
matches
of
the
southron
folk
though
the
red
roses
crest
the
caps
i
know
for
the
field
is
full
of
shades
as
i
near
the
shadowy
coast
and
a
ghostly
batsman
plays
to
the
bowling
of
a
ghost
and
i
look
through
my
tears
on
a
host
as
the
flicker
to
and
fro
to
and
fro
o
my
hornby
and
my
barlow
long
ago
born
at
preston
in
the
son
of
a
doctor
afterwards
in
practice
at
he
inherited
no
literary
traditions
he
had
to
be
sure
an
uncle
an
oxford
convert
to
catholicism
from
the
ranks
of
the
anglican
clergy
whose
name
appears
on
the
title
page
of
which
perhaps
because
for
their
own
times
seem
assuredly
for
no
other
the
seven
years
francis
thompson
passed
at
ushaw
a
college
near
durham
which
then
possessed
few
literary
traditions
besides
those
of
lingard
waterton
and
wiseman
but
can
now
boast
lafcadio
hearn
as
well
as
thompson
own
were
no
doubt
influential
for
him
for
a
certain
individualism
still
lingering
in
outstanding
seats
of
learning
gave
him
a
lucky
freedom
to
follow
his
own
bent
the
ample
reading
of
the
classics
after
ushaw
he
went
to
owens
college
to
qualify
for
his
father
profession
in
his
preliminary
examination
distinguishing
himself
in
greek
his
attempts
to
translate
dead
language
into
living
dated
back
to
these
days
though
of
the
list
of
words
which
some
who
were
amused
and
others
who
were
irritated
put
down
to
his
own
inventing
many
were
made
familiar
to
him
in
his
intercourse
with
milton
with
shelley
with
shakspere
his
most
vital
companions
if
these
poets
went
like
alexander
as
far
as
chaos
and
if
thompson
hazarded
one
step
more
as
emerson
said
goethe
did
thompson
too
swung
himself
safely
back
again
in
manchester
literature
if
not
melancholy
had
already
marked
him
for
her
own
and
it
was
his
rather
than
his
that
he
put
under
his
pillow
perhaps
the
lump
of
it
suggesting
to
him
his
after
image
about
the
poet
dreaming
the
hardest
pang
whereon
he
lays
his
mutinous
head
may
be
a
jacob
stone
a
definite
reminiscence
of
the
at
manchester
may
certainly
be
discovered
in
his
allusion
in
anthem
of
to
the
heart
as
in
like
the
house
of
kings
the
regal
heart
that
comes
at
last
to
stall
the
grey
rat
and
the
statelily
lodge
possibly
the
sorrow
of
filial
duty
unperformed
a
sorrow
deeper
with
him
than
is
common
among
such
predestined
delinquents
aggravated
the
bodily
ailments
which
already
beset
him
and
drastic
indeed
were
the
remedies
he
himself
prescribed
physician
heal
thyself
the
dire
taunt
took
flesh
as
it
were
in
francis
thompson
and
his
plight
was
visible
to
all
men
himself
he
could
not
save
biography
strangely
repeats
itself
not
in
common
mental
experience
only
but
also
in
uncovenanted
details
of
fact
and
incident
like
de
quincey
whose
writings
he
took
into
his
blood
thompson
had
a
nervous
illness
in
manchester
like
de
quincey
he
went
to
london
and
knew
oxford
street
for
a
stepmother
his
wealth
like
de
quincey
once
lay
in
two
volumes
for
he
carried
æschylus
in
one
pocket
blake
in
the
other
and
the
parallel
might
if
to
profit
be
further
outdrawn
to
most
incongruous
modes
of
making
a
living
he
now
put
his
hand
his
assistantship
in
a
shop
near
leicester
square
would
have
fitted
him
for
the
production
of
a
record
of
among
and
later
as
a
collector
for
a
bookseller
he
must
often
have
bent
beneath
the
sack
which
if
heavy
so
he
might
comfort
himself
was
at
least
heavy
with
books
of
these
things
he
spoke
with
a
simplicity
when
a
little
later
some
verses
he
sent
to
a
magazine
brought
him
believers
who
sought
until
they
found
him
after
a
course
of
medical
treatment
he
went
to
storrington
that
beautiful
sussex
village
has
now
its
fixed
place
on
the
map
of
english
literature
for
there
it
was
that
francis
thompson
discovered
his
possibilities
as
a
poet
on
its
common
he
met
the
village
child
whom
he
calls
daisy
in
the
verses
that
are
so
named
and
it
was
characteristic
of
this
poet
that
from
the
ordinary
episodes
of
ordinary
days
he
made
his
golden
musics
when
he
saw
the
sunset
at
storrington
the
resulting
ode
was
dotted
with
local
landmarks
the
cross
for
instance
casting
its
shadow
in
the
monastery
garden
the
children
of
the
family
in
london
into
which
he
was
received
were
the
subjects
of
making
of
monica
thought
my
all
in
the
first
book
of
while
two
of
their
number
have
a
noble
heritage
in
constant
to
the
end
when
he
died
some
newly
pencilled
lines
were
found
addressed
to
olivia
a
yet
younger
sister
recalling
the
strains
of
fifteen
years
before
i
fear
to
love
you
sweet
because
love
the
ambassador
of
loss
to
their
mother
likewise
were
addressed
the
poems
of
fair
love
labelled
in
dian
of
which
coventry
patmore
said
that
laura
might
have
been
proud
hers
also
were
many
of
the
if
therefore
as
one
critic
after
another
declared
a
poet
had
dropped
from
the
skies
those
skies
of
light
of
the
seventeenth
century
he
dropped
very
much
upon
the
spot
mr
thompson
must
simply
be
crashaw
born
again
but
born
greater
declared
the
first
of
his
reviewers
and
mr
traill
in
nineteenth
inquired
where
unless
perhaps
here
and
there
in
a
sonnet
of
rossetti
has
this
sort
of
sublimated
enthusiasm
for
the
bodily
and
spiritual
beauty
of
womanhood
found
such
expression
between
the
age
of
the
stuarts
and
our
own
mr
traill
added
boldly
his
belief
daring
then
though
acceptable
enough
now
that
alike
in
wealth
and
dignity
of
imagination
in
depth
and
subtlety
of
thought
and
in
magic
and
mastery
of
language
england
possessed
in
this
little
volume
the
evidence
of
a
new
poet
of
the
first
rank
more
expectedly
coventry
patmore
in
fortnightly
hailed
in
the
a
disciple
of
their
common
master
the
florentine
poet
of
fair
love
and
expressed
the
opinion
that
mr
thompson
qualities
ought
to
place
him
in
the
permanent
ranks
of
fame
the
of
was
to
patmore
one
of
the
very
few
odes
of
which
the
language
can
boast
such
pronouncements
proved
at
least
that
a
poet
who
had
no
friend
save
such
as
his
published
poems
gained
for
him
could
count
on
an
immediate
recognition
for
high
merit
for
these
tributes
and
many
more
of
like
welcoming
placed
him
instantly
out
of
range
of
the
common
casualties
of
criticism
and
he
had
what
poets
of
old
to
their
great
sorrow
lacked
he
had
trial
by
his
peers
a
kind
fate
gave
him
fellow
poets
among
his
reviewers
perhaps
a
more
convincing
sign
even
than
that
of
professional
praise
was
conveyed
by
the
chance
allusion
he
lighted
on
later
in
lady
biography
of
her
husband
the
winter
labour
she
says
was
cheered
by
the
appearance
of
a
small
volume
of
poems
by
an
author
whose
name
francis
thompson
was
till
then
unknown
to
us
the
little
book
moved
him
to
admiration
and
hope
and
speaking
of
hound
of
himself
said
since
gabriel
damozel
no
mystical
words
have
so
touched
me
shall
i
ever
forget
how
i
undressed
and
dressed
again
and
had
to
undress
again
a
thing
i
most
hate
because
i
could
think
of
nothing
else
published
in
the
poem
of
which
mr
william
archer
has
said
that
shelley
would
have
adored
it
is
a
poem
to
read
aloud
for
sound
and
sense
herein
celebrate
their
divine
nuptials
one
of
the
high
memories
of
the
present
writer
is
that
of
hearing
it
so
read
by
mr
george
wyndham
at
the
hearthstone
of
byron
granddaughter
the
lines
therein
that
deal
with
sex
dormant
in
the
yielded
the
poet
perhaps
his
most
amazing
imagery
superabundance
murmured
some
surely
a
fault
as
happy
as
was
ever
son
of
adam
the
charge
of
obscurity
brought
against
the
poem
was
more
apt
for
who
that
did
not
know
of
his
days
and
his
nights
in
the
london
streets
could
follow
such
a
poignant
piece
of
autobiography
as
this
forlorn
and
faint
and
stark
i
had
endured
through
watches
of
the
dark
the
abashless
inquisition
of
each
star
yea
was
the
outcast
mark
of
all
those
heavenly
passers
scrutiny
stood
bound
and
helplessly
for
time
to
shoot
his
barbèd
minutes
at
me
suffered
the
trampling
hoof
of
every
hour
in
night
car
until
the
tardy
dawn
dragged
me
at
length
from
under
those
dread
wheels
and
bled
of
strength
i
waited
the
inevitable
last
then
there
came
past
a
child
like
thee
a
but
a
flower
fallen
from
the
budded
coronal
of
spring
and
through
the
blown
withering
she
passed
o
brave
sad
lovingest
tender
thing
and
of
her
own
scant
pittance
did
she
give
that
i
might
eat
and
live
then
fled
a
swift
and
trackless
fugitive
and
how
shall
that
final
episode
be
turned
more
explicitly
there
are
still
a
few
things
left
that
can
not
be
uttered
or
if
uttered
that
become
the
counterpart
even
for
the
willing
ear
of
that
tenuity
of
the
bat
cry
reported
to
elude
the
common
hearing
it
is
even
as
balzac
great
talker
himself
says
that
everything
especially
theology
i
think
is
the
cheaper
for
being
discussed
yet
this
untold
story
transcends
the
mere
romance
of
de
quincey
ann
and
might
indeed
for
a
moment
reverse
rossetti
just
indictment
of
the
life
of
jenny
it
makes
a
goblin
of
the
sun
for
this
flower
fallen
from
the
budded
coronal
of
spring
took
root
and
flourished
even
in
london
mire
and
again
the
fragrant
petals
unfolded
and
the
greenery
grew
in
francis
thompson
put
forth
in
mistress
of
his
stark
gospel
of
renunciation
it
is
the
last
word
of
an
asceticism
which
he
practised
as
well
as
preached
most
strait
in
its
abnegation
of
everything
but
the
beauty
his
verse
unlike
his
life
never
could
renounce
coventry
patmore
thompson
true
captain
of
song
used
to
say
that
the
young
poet
prose
was
even
finer
than
his
poetry
and
his
talk
better
than
both
this
was
a
statement
with
the
true
patmorean
touch
of
paradox
any
way
the
talk
had
no
reporter
and
of
his
prose
his
heroic
prose
as
it
has
been
called
only
one
example
passed
during
his
life
into
book
form
the
complaint
made
by
brother
ass
the
body
against
its
rider
the
soul
this
was
published
under
the
title
of
and
accompanied
by
a
note
from
father
tyrrell
but
his
experiences
in
prose
as
a
reviewer
were
wide
as
his
sympathies
and
these
were
sanely
universal
his
articles
in
under
mr
lewis
hind
editorship
must
choke
up
many
a
scrapbook
later
his
contributions
to
afforded
him
his
greatest
scope
and
stimulant
and
only
with
his
death
came
the
eclipse
of
his
powers
editors
forbore
to
be
angry
at
his
delays
for
after
a
while
of
waiting
they
got
from
him
at
last
what
none
else
could
give
at
all
about
ten
weeks
before
the
darkness
fell
on
him
the
little
flame
of
his
life
began
visibly
to
flicker
a
change
to
the
country
was
advised
and
he
became
the
carefully
tended
guest
of
mr
wilfrid
blunt
not
many
miles
from
the
storrington
of
his
early
love
to
which
however
not
wild
arabs
could
any
longer
draw
him
he
was
too
weak
for
any
travel
save
that
which
brought
him
back
to
london
better
he
himself
said
but
surely
dying
as
it
seemed
to
solicitous
eyes
ten
days
before
his
death
he
went
as
a
private
patient
to
the
hospital
of
st
john
and
st
elizabeth
in
st
john
wood
and
there
at
the
age
of
on
november
he
passed
away

dawn

was

was
laid

under
the
banner
of
your
spread
renown
or
if
these
levies
of
impuissant
rhyme
fall
to
the
overthrow
of
assaulting
time
yet
this
one
page
shall
send
oblivious
shame
armed
with
your
crested
and
prevailing
name
poems
on
children
daisy
where
the
thistle
lifts
a
purple
crown
six
foot
out
of
the
turf
and
the
harebell
shakes
on
the
windy
hill
o
the
breath
of
the
distant
surf
the
hills
look
over
on
the
south
and
southward
dreams
the
sea
and
with
the
hand
in
hand
came
innocence
and
she
where
the
gorse
the
raspberry
red
for
the
gatherer
springs
two
children
did
we
stray
and
talk
wise
idle
childish
things
she
listened
with
surprise
flower
and
spine
her
skin
was
like
a
grape
whose
veins
run
snow
instead
of
wine
she
knew
not
those
sweet
words
she
spake
nor
knew
her
own
sweet
way
but
there
never
a
bird
so
sweet
a
song
thronged
in
whose
throat
that
day
oh
there
were
flowers
in
storrington
on
the
turf
and
on
the
spray
but
the
sweetest
flower
on
sussex
hills
was
the
that
day
her
beauty
smoothed
earth
furrowed
face
she
gave
me
tokens
three
a
look
a
word
of
her
winsome
mouth
and
a
wild
raspberry
a
berry
red
a
guileless
look
a
still
word
strings
of
sand
and
yet
they
made
my
wild
wild
heart
fly
down
to
her
little
hand
for
standing
artless
as
the
air
and
candid
as
the
skies
she
took
the
berries
with
her
hand
and
the
love
with
her
sweet
eyes
the
fairest
things
have
fleetest
end
their
scent
survives
their
close
but
the
rose
scent
is
bitterness
to
him
that
loved
the
rose
she
looked
a
little
wistfully
then
went
her
sunshine
way
the
sea
eye
had
a
mist
on
it
and
the
leaves
fell
from
the
day
she
went
her
unremembering
way
she
went
and
left
in
me
the
pang
of
all
the
partings
gone
and
partings
yet
to
be
she
left
me
marvelling
why
my
soul
was
sad
that
she
was
glad
at
all
the
sadness
in
the
sweet
the
sweetness
in
the
sad
still
still
i
seemed
to
see
her
still
look
up
with
soft
replies
and
take
the
berries
with
her
hand
and
the
love
with
her
lovely
eyes
nothing
begins
and
nothing
ends
that
is
not
paid
with
moan
for
we
are
born
in
others
pain
and
perish
in
our
own
the
poppy
to
monica
summer
set
lip
to
earth
bosom
bare
and
left
the
flushed
print
in
a
poppy
there
like
a
yawn
of
fire
from
the
grass
it
came
and
the
fanning
wind
puffed
it
to
flapping
flame
with
burnt
mouth
red
like
a
lion
it
drank
the
blood
of
the
sun
as
he
slaughtered
sank
and
dipped
its
cup
in
the
purpurate
shine
when
the
eastern
conduits
ran
with
wine
till
it
grew
lethargied
with
fierce
bliss
and
hot
as
a
swinkèd
gipsy
is
and
drowsed
in
sleepy
savageries
with
mouth
wide
for
a
sultry
kiss
a
child
and
man
paced
side
by
side
treading
the
skirts
of
eventide
but
between
the
clasp
of
his
hand
and
hers
lay
felt
not
twenty
withered
years
she
turned
with
the
rout
of
her
dusk
south
hair
and
saw
the
sleeping
gipsy
there
and
snatched
and
snapped
it
in
swift
child
whim
with
keep
it
long
as
you
live
to
him
and
his
smile
as
nymphs
from
their
laving
meres
trembled
up
from
a
bath
of
tears
and
joy
like
a
mew
apart
tossed
on
the
wave
of
his
troubled
heart
for
saw
what
she
did
not
see
that
as
kindled
by
its
own
fervency
the
verge
shrivelled
inward
smoulderingly
and
suddenly
his
hand
and
hers
he
knew
the
twenty
withered
years
no
flower
but
twenty
shrivelled
years
was
never
such
thing
until
this
hour
low
to
his
heart
he
said
the
flower
of
sleep
brings
wakening
to
me
and
of
oblivion
memory
was
never
this
thing
to
me
he
said
though
with
bruisèd
poppies
my
feet
are
red
and
again
to
his
own
heart
very
low
o
child
i
love

you

dying
you
o
the
piteous
you
who
all
the
long
night
through
anticipatedly
disclose
yourself
to
me
already
in
the
ways
beyond
our
human
comfortable
days
how
can
you
deem
what
death
impitiably
saith
to
me
who
listening
wake
for
your
poor
sake
when
a
grown
woman
dies
you
know
we
think
unceasingly
what
things
she
said
how
sweet
how

and
these
do
make
our
misery
but
you
were
you
to
me
the
dead
anticipatedly
you
eleven
years
was
not
or
so
were
just
a
child
you
know
and
so
you
never
said
things
sweet
immeditatably
and
wise
to
interdict
from
closure
my
wet
eyes
but
foolish
things
my
dead
my
dead
little
and
laughable
your
age
that
fitted
well
and
was
it
such
things
all
unmemorable
was
it
such
things
could
make
me
sob
all
night
for
your
implacable
sake
yet
as
you
said
to
me
in
pretty
of
revelry
so
the
night
long
said
death
with
his
magniloquent

another

doth
dreadful
wrong
this
dreadful
childish
babble
on
his

iron
tongue
made

insupportably
complete

did
you

fatal
mouth

your
old
trivialness
why
have
you
done
me
this
most
unsustainable
wrong
and
into
death
control
betrayed
the
secret
places
of
my
soul
teaching
him
that
his
lips
uttering
their
native
earthquake
and
eclipse
could
never
so
avail
to
rend
from
hem
to

the
ultimate
veil

most
desolate
spirit

leave
it
stripped

never

unmanned

when
his
terrible
dotage

among
his
sepulchres
to
play
with
broken
toys
your
hand
has
cast
away
with
derelict
trinkets

this

galleon
riding
at

off
the

sun
had
broken
its
cable
and
stood
out
to

down
some
frore
arctic
of
the
aerial
ways
and
now
back
warping
from
the
inclement
main
its
vapourous
shroudage
drenched
with
icy
rain
it
swung
into
its
azure
roads

to

surely
you

you
bear
the

of
me

ah
from
any

that
it
came
lest
fated
to
my
fate
you
be
as
to
my

when
at
the

those

me
if
while
you

the
vigils
of
the
night
for

make
darkness
all
too
bright
some
lone
orb
through

as
it

over
your

think
it
a
golden
crevice
in

sky
which
i
have
pierced
but
to
behold
you
by
and
when
immortal
mortal
droops
your
head
and
you
the
child
of
deathless
song
are
dead
then
as
you
search
with
unaccustomed

the
ranks
of

turn
not
your

along
the
uranian
sod
among

for
if
in

as
on

are
we
i
sure
shall
keep
a
younger
company
pass
where
beneath
their
rangèd
gonfalons
the
starry
cohorts
shake
their
shielded
suns
the
dreadful
mass
of
their
enridgèd
spears
pass
where
majestical
the
eternal
peers
the
stately
choice
of
the
great
saintdom
meet
a
silvern
segregation
globed
complete
in
sandalled
shadow
of
the
triune
feet

where
wait
young
your
cousined
clusters
emulous
to
share
with
you
the
roseal
lightnings
burning
their
hair
pass
the
crystalline
sea
the
lampads
seven
look
for
me
in
the
nurseries
of
heaven
ex
ore
infantium
little
jesus
wast
thou
shy
once
and
just
so
small
as
i
and
what
did
it
feel
like
to
be
out
of
heaven
and
just
like
me
didst
thou
sometimes
think
of
and
ask
where
all
the
angels
were
i
should
think
that
i
would
cry
for
my
house
all
made
of
sky
i
would
look
about
the
air
and
wonder
where
my
angels
were
and
at
waking
distress
me
not
an
angel
there
to
dress
me
hadst
thou
ever
any
toys
like
us
little
girls
and
boys
and
didst
thou
play
in
heaven
with
all
the
angels
that
were
not
too
tall
with
stars
for
marbles
did
the
things
play
you
see
me
through
their
wings
didst
thou
kneel
at
night
to
pray
and
didst
thou
join
thy
hands
this
way
and
did
they
tire
sometimes
being
young
and
make
the
prayer
seem
very
long
and
dost
thou
like
it
best
that
we
should
join
our
hands
to
pray
to
thee
i
used
to
think
before
i
knew
the
prayer
not
said
unless
we
do
and
did
thy
mother
at
the
night
kiss
thee
and
fold
the
clothes
in
right
and
didst
thou
feel
quite
good
in
bed
kissed
and
sweet
and
thy
prayers
said
thou
canst
not
have
forgotten
all
that
it
feels
like
to
be
small
and
thou
i
can
not
pray
to
thee
in
my
father
way
when
thou
wast
so
little
say
couldst
thou
talk
thy
father
way
so
a
little
child
come
down
and
hear
a
child
tongue
like
thy
own
take
me
by
the
hand
and
walk
and
listen
to
my
to
thy
father
show
my
prayer
he
will
look
thou
art
so
fair
and
say
o
father
i
thy
son
bring
the
prayer
of
a
little
one
and
he
will
smile
that
children
tongue
has
not
changed
since
thou
wast
young
from
sister
songs
a
child
kiss
where
its
umbrage
a
was
enrooted
sat
sat
and
spring
amid
her
minstrelsy
there
she
sat
amid
her
ladies
where
the
shade
is
sheen
as
enna
mead
ere
gloom
fell
thwart
persephone
dewy
buds
were
interstrown
through
her
tresses
hanging
down
and
her
feet
were
most
sweet
tinged
like
rosied
brown
a
throng
of
children
like
to
flowers
were
sown
about
the
grass
beside
or
clomb
her
knee
i
looked
who
were
that
favoured
company
and
one
there
stood
against
the
beamy
flood
of
sinking
day
which
pouring
its
abundance
sublimed
the
illuminous
and
volute
redundance
of
locks
that
half
dissolving
floated
round
her
face
as
see
i
might
far
off
a
poised
in
sun
dispread
its
gracile
curls
of
light
i
knew
what
chosen
child
was
there
in
place
i
knew
there
might
no
brows
be
save
of
one
with
such
hesperian
fulgence
compassèd
which
in
her
moving
seemed
to
wheel
about
her
head
spring
little
children
more
loud
your
lauds
upraise
for
this
is
even
sylvia
with
her
sweet
feat
ways
your
lovesome
labours
lay
away
and
prank
you
out
in
holiday
for
syllabling
to
sylvia
and
all
you
birds
on
branches
lave
your
mouths
with
may
to
bear
with
me
this
burthen
for
singing
to
sylvia
spring
goddess
is
it
thou
desirèd
long
and
art
thou
girded
round
with
this
young
train
if
ever
i
did
do
thee
ease
in
song
now
of
thy
grace
let
me
one
meed
obtain
and
list
thou
to
one
plain
oh
keep
still
in
thy
train
after
the
years
when
others
therefrom
fade
this
tiny
maid
to
whom
the
gate
of
my
heart
fortalice
with
all
which
in
it
is
and
the
shy
self
who
doth
therein
immew
him
what
loud
leaguerers
battailously
woo
him
i
bribèd
traitor
to
him
set
open
for
one
kiss
a
kiss
for
a
child
kiss
aye
goddess
even
for
this
once
bright
sylviola
in
days
not
far
once
in
that
which
still
doth
haunt
my
dreams
a
grim
unbidden
visitant
forlorn
and
faint
and
stark
i
had
endured
through
watches
of
the
dark
the
abashless
inquisition
of
each
star
yea
was
the
outcast
mark
of
all
those
heavenly
passers
scrutiny
stood
bound
and
helplessly
for
time
to
shoot
his
barbèd
minutes
at
me
suffered
the
trampling
hoof
of
every
hour
in
night
car
until
the
tardy
dawn
dragged
me
at
length
from
under
those
dread
wheels
and
bled
of
strength
i
waited
the
inevitable
last
then
there
came
past
a
child
like
thee
a
but
a
flower
fallen
from
the
budded
coronal
of
spring
and
through
the
blown
withering
she
passed
o
brave
sad
lovingest
tender
thing
and
of
her
own
scant
pittance
did
she
give
that
i
might
eat
and
live
then
fled
a
swift
and
trackless
fugitive
therefore
i
kissed
in
thee
the
heart
of
childhood
so
divine
for
me
and
her
through
what
sore
ways
and
what
unchildish
days
borne
from
me
now
as
then
a
trackless
fugitive
therefore
i
kissed
in
thee
her
child
and
innocency
and
spring
and
all
things
that
have
gone
from
me
and
that
shall
never
be
all
vanished
hopes
and
all
most
hopeless
bliss
came
with
thee
to
my
kiss
and
ah
so
long
myself
had
strayed
afar
from
child
and
woman
and
the
boon
earth
green
and
all
wherewith
life
face
is
fair
beseen
journeying
its
journey
bare
five
suns
except
of
the
sun
unkissed
of
one
almost
i
had
forgot
the
healing
harms
and
whitest
witchery
in
that
authentic
cestus
of
two
girdling
arms
and
i
remembered
not
the
subtle
sanctities
which
dart
from
childish
lips
unvalued
precious
brush
nor
how
it
makes
the
sudden
lilies
push
between
the
loosening
fibres
of
the
heart
then
that
thy
little
kiss
should
be
to
me
all
this
let
workaday
wisdom
blink
sage
lids
thereat
which
towers
a
flight
three
hedgerows
high
poor
bat
and
straightway
charts
me
out
the
empyreal
air
its
chart
i
wing
not
by
its
canon
of
worth
scorn
not
nor
reck
though
mine
should
breed
it
mirth
and
howso
thou
and
i
may
be
disjoint
yet
still
my
falcon
spirit
makes
her
point
over
the
covert
where
thou
sweetest
quarry
hast
put
in
from
her
hush
these
sad
numbers
too
sad
to
upraise
in
hymning
bright
sylvia
unlearn
in
such
ways
our
mournful
moods
lay
me
away
and
prank
our
thoughts
in
holiday
for
syllabling
to
sylvia
when
all
the
birds
on
branches
lave
their
mouths
with
may
to
bear
with
us
this
burthen
for
singing
to
sylvia
a
the
umbrage
of
an
described
earlier
in
the
from
which
this
and
the
six
succeeding
poems
are
detached
poet
and
anchorite
love
and
love
beauty
only
hold
their
revels
in
life
familiar
penetrable
levels
what
of
its
i
dwell
there
evermore
from
almost
earliest
youth
i
raised
the
lids
o
the
truth
and
forced
her
bend
on
me
her
shrinking
sight
ever
i
knew
me
beauty
eremite
in
antre
of
this
lowly
body
set
girt
with
a
thirsty
solitude
of
soul
natheless
i
not
forget
how
i
have
even
as
the
anchorite
i
too
imperishing
essences
that
console
under
my
ruined
passions
fallen
and
sere
the
wild
dreams
stir
like
little
radiant
girls
whom
in
the
moulted
plumage
of
the
year
their
comrades
sweet
have
buried
to
the
curls
yet
though
their
dedicated
amorist
how
often
do
i
bid
my
visions
hist
deaf
to
them
pleading
all
their
piteous
fills
who
weep
as
weep
the
maidens
of
the
mist
clinging
the
necks
of
the
unheeding
hills
and
their
tears
wash
them
lovelier
than
before
that
from
grief
self
our
sad
delight
grows
more
fair
are
the
soul
uncrispèd
calms
indeed
endiapered
with
many
a
spiritual
form
of
weed
but
scarce
itself
is
conscious
of
the
store
suckled
by
it
and
only
after
storm
casts
up
its
loosened
thoughts
upon
the
shore
to
this
end
my
deeps
are
stirred
and
i
deem
well
why
life
unshared
was
ordainèd
me
of
yore
in
we
know
the
bird
kindles
to
its
deepmost
splendour
and
the
tender
voice
is
tenderest
in
its
throat
were
its
love
for
ever
nigh
it
never
by
it
it
might
keep
a
vernal
note
the
crocean
and
amethystine
in
their
pristine
lustre
linger
on
its
coat
therefore
must
my
lone
be
that
my
tone
be
fresh
with
dewy
pain
alway
she
who
scorns
my
dearest
care
an
uncertain
shadow
of
the
sprite
of
may
the
omen
yet
is
there
more
whereat
none
guesseth
love
upon
the
ending
of
my
deadly
night
whereof
thou
hast
not
the
surmise
and
slight
is
all
that
any
mortal
knows
thereof
thou
wert
to
me
that
earnest
of
day
light
when
like
the
back
of
a
saurian
heaving
its
slow
length
from
nilotic
slime
the
first
long
gleaming
fissure
runs
aurorian
athwart
the
yet
dun
firmament
of
prime
stretched
on
the
margin
of
the
cruel
sea
whence
they
had
rescued
me
with
faint
and
painful
pulses
was
i
lying
not
yet
discerning
well
if
i
had
or
were
an
icicle
whose
thawing
is
its
dying
like
one
who
sweats
before
a
despot
gate
summoned
by
some
presaging
scroll
of
fate
and
knows
not
whether
kiss
or
dagger
wait
and
all
so
sickened
is
his
countenance
the
courtiers
buzz
lo
doomed
and
look
at
him
askance
at
fate
dread
portal
then
even
so
stood
i
i
ken
even
so
stood
i
between
a
joy
and
fear
and
said
to
mine
own
heart
now
if
the
end
be
here
they
say
earth
beauty
seems
completest
to
them
that
on
their
rest
gentle
lady
she
smiles
sweetest
just
ere
she
clasps
us
to
her
breast
and
i
now
earth
countenance
grew
bright
did
she
but
smile
me
towards
that
but
whileas
on
such
dubious
bed
i
lay
one
unforgotten
day
as
a
sick
child
waking
sees
daisies
gazing
on
it
from
its
hand
slipped
there
for
its
dear
amazes
so
between
thy
father
knees
i
saw
stand
and
through
my
hazes
of
pain
and
fear
thine
eyes
young
wonder
shone
then
as
flies
scatter
from
a
carrion
or
rooks
in
spreading
gyres
like
broken
smoke
wheel
when
some
sound
their
quietude
has
broke
fled
at
thy
countenance
all
that
doubting
spawn
the
heart
which
i
had
questioned
spoke
a
cry
impetuous
from
its
depths
was
drawn
i
take
the
omen
of
this
face
of
dawn
and
with
the
omen
to
my
heart
thou
even
with
a
spray
of
tears
that
one
light
draft
was
fixed
there
for
the
years
and
now
the
hours
i
tread
ooze
memories
of
thee
sweet
beneath
my
casual
feet
with
rainfall
as
the
lea
the
day
is
drenched
with
thee
in
little
exquisite
surprises
bubbling
deliciousness
of
thee
arises
from
sudden
places
under
the
common
traces
of
my
most
lethargied
and
customed
paces
the
mirage
as
an
arab
journeyeth
through
a
sand
of
ayaman
lean
thirst
lolling
its
cracked
tongue
lagging
by
his
side
along
and
a
death
grating
its
low
flight
before
casting
ribbèd
shadows
the
blank
desert
blank
and
tan
he
lifts
by
hap
toward
where
the
morning
roots
are
his
weary
stare
sees
although
they
plashless
mutes
are
set
in
a
silver
air
fountains
of
gelid
shoots
are
making
the
daylight
fairest
fair
sees
the
palm
and
tamarind
tangle
the
tresses
of
a
phantom
wind
a
sight
like
innocence
when
one
has
sinned
a
green
and
maiden
freshness
smiling
there
while
with
unblinking
glare
the
desert
crouches
watching
her
is
a
vision
yet
the
greeneries
elysian
he
has
known
in
tracts
afar
thus
the
enamouring
fountains
flow
those
the
very
palms
that
grow
by
sava
or
such
a
watered
dream
has
tarried
trembling
on
my
desert
arid
even
so
its
lovely
gleamings
seemings
show
of
things
not
seemings
and
i
gaze
knowing
that
beyond
my
ways
verily
all
these
for
these
are
she
eve
no
gentlier
lays
her
cooling
cheek
on
the
burning
brow
of
the
sick
earth
sick
with
death
and
sick
with
birth
aeon
to
aeon
in
secular
fever
twirled
than
thy
shadow
soothes
this
weak
and
distempered
being
of
mine
in
all
i
work
my
hand
includeth
thine
thou
rushest
down
in
every
stream
whose
passion
frets
my
spirit
deepening
gorge
mine
and
fliest
my
dream
thou
the
hammers
of
my
forge
as
the
innocent
moon
that
nothing
does
but
shine
moves
all
the
labouring
surges
of
the
world
pierce
where
thou
wilt
the
springing
thought
in
me
and
there
thy
pictured
countenance
lies
enfurled
as
in
the
cut
fern
lies
the
imaged
tree
this
poor
song
that
sings
of
thee
this
fragile
song
is
but
a
curled
shell
outgathered
from
thy
sea
and
murmurous
still
of
its
nativity
the
o
thou
most
dear
who
art
thy
sex
complex
harmony
more
facilely
to
thee
may
love
draw
near
without
one
blame
or
fear
unchidden
save
by
his
humility
thou
perseus
shield
wherein
i
view
secure
the
mirrored
woman
allure
whom
heaven
still
leaves
a
twofold
dignity
as
girlhood
gentle
and
as
boyhood
free
with
whom
no
most
diaphanous
webs
enwind
the
barèd
limbs
of
the
rebukeless
mind
wild
dryad
all
unconscious
of
thy
tree
with
which
indissolubly
the
tyrannous
time
shall
one
day
make
thee
whole
whose
frank
arms
pass
unfretted
through
its
bole
who
thy
femineity
light
as
entrailèd
blossoms
that
shalt
find
it
erelong
silver
shackles
unto
thee
thou
whose
young
sex
is
yet
but
in
thy
soul
as
hoarded
in
the
vine
hang
the
gold
skins
of
undelirious
wine
as
air
sleeps
till
it
toss
its
limbs
in
breeze
in
whom
the
mystery
which
lures
and
sunders
grapples
and
thrusts
apart
endears
estranges
the
dragon
to
its
own
hesperides
is
gated
under
changes
manifold
doors
of
years
so
once
ere
heaven
eyes
were
filled
with
wonders
to
see
laughter
rise
from
tears
lay
in
beauty
not
yet
mighty
conchèd
in
translucencies
the
antenatal
aphrodite
caved
magically
under
magic
seas
caved
dreamlessly
beneath
the
dreamful
seas
whose
sex
is
in
thy
soul
what
think
we
of
thy
soul
which
has
no
parts
and
can
not
grow
unfurled
not
from
an
embryo
born
of
full
stature
lineal
to
control
and
yet
a
pigmy
yoke
must
undergo
yet
must
keep
pace
and
tarry
patient
kind
with
its
unwilling
scholar
the
dull
tardy
mind
must
be
obsequious
to
the
body
powers
whose
low
hands
mete
its
paths
set
ope
and
close
its
ways
must
do
obeisance
to
the
days
and
wait
the
little
pleasure
of
the
hours
yea
ripe
for
kingship
yet
must
be
captive
in
statuted
minority
so
is
all
power
fulfilled
as
soul
in
thee
so
still
the
ruler
by
the
ruled
takes
rule
and
wisdom
weaves
itself
i
the
loom
o
the
fool
the
splendent
sun

things

the

itself
as
soul
in
thee
for
supreme
spirit
subject
was
to
clay
and
law
from
its
own
servants
learned
a
law
and
light
besought
a
lamp
unto
its
way
and
awe
was
reined
in
awe
at
one
small
house
of
nazareth
and
golgotha
saw
breath
to
breathlessness
resign
its
breath
and
life
do
homage
for
its
crown
to
death
to
a
child
heard
repeating
her
mother
verses
as
a
nymph
carven
head
sweet
water
drips
for
others
oozing
so
the
cool
delight
which
can
not
steep
her
stiffened
mouth
of
stone
thy
nescient
lips
repeat
maternal
strains
memnonian
lips
smitten
with
singing
from
thy
mother
east
and
murmurous
with
music
not
their
own
nay
the
lips
flexile
while
the
mind
alone
a
passionless
statue
stands
oh
pardon
innocent
one
pardon
at
thine
unconscious
hands
murmurous
with
music
not
their
own
i
say
and
in
that
saying
how
do
i
missay
when
from
the
common
sands
of
poorest
common
speech
of
common
day
thine
accents
sift
the
golden
musics
out
and
ah
we
poets
i
misdoubt
are
little
more
than
thou
we
speak
a
lesson
taught
we
know
not
how
and
what
it
is
that
from
us
flows
the
hearer
better
than
the
utterer
knows
and
thou
bright
girl
not
long
shalt
thou
repeat
idly
the
music
from
thy
mother
caught
not
vainly
has
she
wrought
not
vainly
from
the
turret
of
her
aerial
mind
for
thy
weak
feet
let
down
the
silken
ladder
of
her
thought
she
bare
thee
with
a
double
pain
of
the
body
and
the
spirit
thou
thy
fleshly
weeds
hast
thy
diviner
weeds
inherit
the
precious
streams
which
through
thy
young
lips
roll
shall
leave
their
lovely
delta
in
thy
soul
where
sprites
of
so
essential
kind
set
their
paces
surely
they
shall
leave
behind
the
green
traces
of
their
sportance
in
the
mind
and
thou
shalt
ere
we
well
may
know
it
turn
that
daintiness
a
poet
where
sweet
fancies
foot
and
sing
so
it
may
be
so
it
be
o
take
the
prophecy
from
me
what
if
the
old
fastidious
sculptor
time
this
crescent
marvel
of
his
hands
carveth
all
too
painfully
and
i
who
prophesy
shall
never
see
what
if
the
niche
of
its
predestined
rhyme
its
aching
niche
too
long
expectant
stands
yet
shall
he
after
sore
delays
on
some
exultant
day
of
days
the
white
enshrouding
childhood
raise
from
thy
fair
spirit
finished
for
our
gaze
while
we
but
that
happy
we
the
prophet
can
not
be
while
we
behold
with
no
astonishments
with
that
serene
fulfilment
of
delight
wherewith
we
view
the
sight
when
the
stars
pitch
the
golden
tents
of
their
high
encampment
on
the
plains
of
night
why
should
amazement
be
our
satellite
what
wonder
in
such
things
if
angels
have
hereditary
wings
if
not
by
salic
law
is
handed
down
the
poet
crown
to
thee
born
in
the
purple
of
the
throne
the
laurel
must
belong
thou
in
thy
mother
right
descendant
of
kings
o
princess
of
the
blood
of
song
a
foretelling
of
the
child
husband
but
on
a
day
whereof
i
think
one
shall
dip
his
hand
to
drink
in
that
still
water
of
thy
soul
and
its
imaged
tremors
race
over
thy
face
as
the
intervolved
reflections
roll
from
a
shaken
fountain
brink
with
swift
light
wrinkling
its
alcove
from
the
hovering
wing
of
love
the
warm
stain
shall
flit
roseal
on
thy
cheek
then
sweet
blushet
whenas
he
the
destined
paramount
of
thy
universe
who
has
no
worlds
to
sigh
for
ruling
thee
ascends
his
vermeil
throne
of
empery
one
grace
alone
i
seek
oh
may
this
of
my
verse
fraught
with
its
golden
passion
oared
with
cadent
rhyme
set
with
a
towering
press
of
fantasies
drop
safely
down
the
time
leaving
mine
islèd
self
behind
it
far
soon
to
be
sunken
in
the
abysm
of
seas
as
down
the
years
the
splendour
voyages
from
some
long
ruined
and
star
and
in
thy
subject
sovereign
havening
heart
anchor
the
freightage
of
its
virgin
ore
adding
its
wasteful
more
to
his
own
overflowing
treasury
so
through
his
river
mine
shall
reach
thy
sea
bearing
its
confluent
part
in
his
pulse
mine
shall
thrill
and
the
quick
heart
shall
quicken
from
the
heart
that
still
pass
your
ways
fair
bird
and
pass
your
ways
if
you
will
i
have
you
through
the
days
and
flit
or
hold
you
still
and
perch
you
where
you
list
on
what
wrist
you
are
mine
through
the
times
i
have
caught
you
fast
for
ever
in
a
tangle
of
sweet
rhymes
and
in
your
young
maiden
morn
you
may
scorn
but
you
must
be
bound
and
sociate
to
me
with
this
thread
from
out
the
tomb
my
dead
hand
shall
tether
thee
love
in
dian
lap
before
her
portrait
in
youth
as
lovers
banished
from
their
lady
face
and
hopeless
of
her
grace
fashion
a
ghostly
sweetness
in
its
place
fondly
adore
some
cast
attire
she
wore
a
kerchief
or
a
glove
and
at
the
lover
beck
into
the
glove
there
fleets
the
hand
or
at
impetuous
command
up
from
the
kerchief
floats
the
virgin
neck
so
i
in
very
lowlihead
of
love
too
shyly
reverencing
to
let
one
thought
light
footfall
smooth
tread
near
the
living
consecrated
thing
treasure
me
thy
cast
youth
this
outworn
vesture
tenantless
of
thee
hath
yet
my
knee
for
that
with
show
and
semblance
fair
of
the
past
her
who
once
the
beautiful
discarded
raiment
bare
it
cheateth
me
as
gale
to
gale
drifts
breath
of
blossoms
death
so
dropping
down
the
years
from
hour
to
hour
this
dead
youth
scent
is
wafted
me
i
sit
and
from
the
fragrance
dream
the
flower
so
then
she
looked
i
say
and
so
her
front
sunk
down
heavy
beneath
the
poet
iron
crown
on
her
mouth
museful
sweet
even
as
the
twin
lips
meet
did
thought
and
sadness
greet
sighs
in
those
mournful
eyes
so
put
on
visibilities
as
viewless
ether
turns
in
deep
on
deep
to
dyes
thus
long
ago
she
kept
her
meditative
paces
slow
through
maiden
meads
with
wavèd
shadow
and
gleam
of
locks
on
the
winds
of
dream
till
love
her
to
his
chariot
glow
yet
voluntary
happier
proserpine
this
drooping
flower
of
youth
thou
lettest
fall
i
faring
in
the
astray
find
on
my
way
and
stoop
and
gather
for
memorial
and
lay
it
on
my
bosom
and
make
it
mine
to
this
the
all
of
love
the
stars
allow
me
i
dedicate
and
vow
me
i
reach
back
through
the
days
a
trothed
hand
to
the
dead
the
last
trump
shall
not
raise
the
that
cries
from
those
eternal
sorrows
of
thy
pictured
eyes
entwines
and
draws
me
down
their
soundless
intricacies
to
a
poet
breaking
silence
too
wearily
had
we
and
song
been
left
to
look
and
left
to
long
yea
song
and
we
to
long
and
look
since
thine
acquainted
feet
forsook
the
mountain
where
the
muses
hymn
for
sinai
and
the
seraphim
now
in
both
the
mountains
shine
dress
thy
countenance
twice
divine
from
moses
and
the
muses
draw
the
tables
of
thy
double
law
his
fount
and
castaly
let
the
one
rock
bring
forth
for
thee
renewing
so
from
either
spring
the
songs
which
both
thy
countries
sing
or
we
shall
fear
lest
heavened
thus
long
thou
forget
thy
native
song
and
mar
thy
mortal
melodies
with
broken
stammer
of
the
skies
ah
let
the
sweet
birds
of
the
lord
with
earth
waters
make
accord
teach
how
the
crucifix
may
be
carven
from
the
fruit
of
the
hesperides
burnish
take
on
the
muses
sacred
grove
be
wet
with
the
red
dew
of
olivet
and
sappho
lay
her
burning
brows
in
white
cecilia
lap
of
snows
i
think
thy
girlhood
watchers
must
have
took
thy
folded
songs
on
trust
and
felt
them
as
one
feels
the
stir
of
still
lightnings
in
the
hair
when
conscious
hush
expects
the
cloud
to
speak
the
golden
secret
loud
which
tacit
air
is
privy
to
flasked
in
the
grape
the
wine
they
knew
ere
thy
was
able
for
its
first
young
starry
babble
thou
not
yet
that
subtle
grace
yea
in
this
silent
interspace
god
sets
his
poems
in
thy
face
the
loom
which
mortal
verse
affords
out
of
weak
and
mortal
words
wovest

of

all

ah
heavenly
thy

bewrayeth
through
that

the
great
uranian
house
of

as
the
vintages
of

of
the

that
riped
their

we
know
what
sun
thy
lampèd
clusters
throbbed
upon
what
plumèd
feet
the

thy

is
flavorous
of

whatever

they

gone

whereso
you
keep

her

she
that

queen
her

so
thou

to
be

learn
the

heaven

might
leave

and
at
my
feet
learn
the
harping
of
mortals
her
portrait
oh
but
the
heavenly
grammar
did
i
hold
of
that
high
speech
which
angels
tongues
turn
gold
so
should
her
deathless
beauty
take
no
wrong
praised
in
her
own
great
kindred
fit
and
cognate
tongue
or
if
that
language
yet
with
us
abode
which
adam
in
the
garden
talked
with
god
but
our
untempered
speech
descends
poor
heirs
grimy
and
still
from
babel
bricklayers
curse
on
the
brutish
jargon
we
inherit
strong
but
to
damn
not
memorise
a
spirit
a
cheek
a
lip
a
limb
a
bosom
they
move
with
light
ease
in
speech
of
and
women
we
do
use
to
praise
even
so
but
here
the
gates
we
burst
and
to
the
temple
go
their
praise
were
her
dispraise
who
dare
who
dare
adulate
the
seraphim
for
their
burning
hair
how
if
with
them
i
dared
here
should
i
dare
it
how
praise
the
woman
who
but
know
the
spirit
how
praise
the
colour
of
her
eyes
uncaught
while
they
were
coloured
with
her
varying
thought
how
her
mouth
shape
who
only
use
to
know
what
tender
shape
her
speech
will
fit
it
to
or
her
lips
redness
when
their
joinèd
veil
song
fervid
hand
has
parted
till
it
wore
them
pale
if
i
would
praise
her
soul
temerarious
if
all
must
be
mystery
and
hieroglyph
heaven
which
not
oft
is
prodigal
of
its
more
to
singers
in
their
song
too
great
before
by
which
the
hierarch
of
large
poesy
is
restrained
to
his
one
sacred
benefice
only
for
her
the
salutary
awe
relaxes
and
stern
canon
of
its
law
to
her
alone
concedes
pluralities
in
her
alone
to
reconcile
agrees
the
muse
the
graces
and
the
charities
to
her
who
can
the
trust
so
well
conduct
to
her
it
gives
the
use
to
us
the
usufruct
what
of
the
dear
administress
then
may
i
utter
though
i
spoke
her
own
carved
perfect
way
what
of
her
daily
gracious
converse
known
whose
heavenly
despotism
must
needs
dethrone
and
subjugate
all
sweetness
but
its
own
deep
in
my
heart
subsides
the
infrequent
word
and
there
dies
slowly
throbbing
like
a
wounded
bird
what
of
her
silence
that
outsweetens
speech
what
of
her
thoughts
high
marks
for
mine
own
thoughts
to
reach
yet
chaucer
antique
sentence
so
to
turn
most
gladly
will
she
teach
and
gladly
learn
and
teaching
her
by
her
enchanting
art
the
master
threefold
learns
for
all
he
can
impart
now
all
is
said
and
all
being
said
aye
me
there
yet
remains
unsaid
the
very
she
nay
to
conclude
so
to
conclude
i
dare
if
of
her
virtues
you
evade
the
snare
then
for
her
faults
you
fall
in
love
with
her
alas
and
i
have
spoken
of
her
muse
her
muse
that
died
with
her
auroral
dews
learn
the
wise
cherubim
from
harps
of
gold
seduce
a
trepidating
music
manifold
but
the
superior
seraphim
do
know
none
other
music
but
to
flame
and
glow
so
she
first
lighted
on
our
frosty
earth
a
sad
musician
of
cherubic
birth
playing
to
alien
ears
which
did
not
prize
the
uncomprehended
music
of
the
skies
the
exiled
airs
of
her
far
paradise
but
soon
from
her
own
harpings
taking
fire
in
love
and
light
her
melodies
expire
now
heaven
affords
her
for
her
silenced
hymn
a
double
portion
of
the
seraphim
at
the
rich
odours
from
her
heart
that
rise
my
soul
remembers
its
lost
paradise
and
antenatal
gales
blow
from
heaven
shores
of
spice
i
grow
essential
all
uncloaking
me
from
this
encumbering
virility
and
feel
the
primal
sex
of
heaven
and
poetry
and
parting
from
her
in
me
linger
on
vague
snatches
of
uranian
antiphon
how
to
the
petty
prison
could
she
shrink
of
femineity
nay
but
i
think
in
a
dear
courtesy
her
spirit
would
woman
assume
for
grace
to
womanhood
or
votaress
to
the
virgin
sanctitude
of
reticent
withdrawal
sweet
courted
pale
she
took
the
cloistral
flesh
the
sexual
veil
of
her
sad
aboriginal
sisterhood
the
habit
of
cloistral
flesh
which
founding
eve
indued
thus
do
i
know
her
but
for
what
men
call
beauty
the
loveliness
corporeal
its
most
just
praise
a
thing
unproper
were
to
singer
or
to
listener
me
or
her
she
wears
that
body
but
as
one
indues
a
robe
half
careless
for
it
is
the
use
although
her
soul
and
it
so
fair
agree
we
sure
may
unattaint
of
heresy
conceit
it
might
the
soul
begetter
be
the
immortal
could
we
cease
to
contemplate
the
mortal
part
suggests
its
every
trait
god
laid
his
fingers
on
the
ivories
of
her
pure
members
as
on
smoothèd
keys
and
there
her
spirit
harmonies
i
speak
a
little
proudly
i
disdain
to
count
the
beauty
worth
my
wish
or
gain
which
the
dull
daily
fool
can
covet
or
obtain
i
do
confess
the
fairness
of
the
spoil
but
from
such
rivalry
it
takes
a
soil
for
her
i
proudlier
speak
how
could
it
be
that
i
should
praise
the
gilding
on
the
psaltery
is
not
for
her
to
hold
that
prize
a
prize
or
praise
much
praise
though
proudest
in
its
wise
to
which
even
hopes
of
merely
women
rise
such
strife
would
to
the
vanquished
laurels
yield
against
suffered
to
have
lost
a
field
herself
must
with
herself
be
sole
compeer
unless
the
people
of
her
distant
sphere
some
gold
migration
send
to
melodise
the
year
yet
i
have
felt
what
terrors
may
consort
in
women
cheeks
the
graces
soft
resort
my
hand
hath
shook
at
gentle
hands
access
and
trembled
at
the
waving
of
a
tress
my
blood
known
panic
fear
and
fled
dismayed
where
ladies
eyes
have
set
their
ambuscade
the
rustle
of
a
robe
hath
been
to
me
the
very
rattle
of
love
musketry
although
my
heart
hath
beat
the
loud
advance
i
have
recoiled
before
a
challenging
glance
proved
gay
alarms
where
warlike
ribbons
dance
and
from
it
all
this
knowledge
have
i
got
the
whole
that
others
have
is
less
than
they
have
not
all
which
makes
other
women
noted
fair
unnoted
would
remain
and
overshone
in
her
how
should
i
gauge
what
beauty
is
her
dole
who
can
not
see
her
countenance
for
her
soul
as
birds
see
not
the
casement
for
the
sky
and
as
is
check
they
prove
its
presence
by
i
know
not
of
her
body
till
i
find
my
flight
debarred
the
heaven
of
her
mind
hers
is
the
face
whence
all
should
copied
be
did
god
make
replicas
of
such
as
she
its
presence
felt
by
what
it
does
abate
because
the
soul
shines
through
tempered
and
mitigate
where
as
a
figure
labouring
at
night
beside
the
body
of
a
splendid
light
dark
time
works
hidden
by
its
luminousness
and
every
line
he
labours
to
impress
turns
added
beauty
like
the
veins
that
run
athwart
a
leaf
which
hangs
against
the
sun
there
regent
melancholy
wide
controls
there
play
for
aureoles
there
sweetness
out
of
sadness
breaks
at
fits
like
bubbles
on
dark
water
or
as
flits
a
sudden
silver
fin
through
its
deep
infinites
there
amorous
thought
has
sucked
pale
fancy
breath
and
tenderness
sits
looking
towards
the
lands
of
death
there
feeling
stills
her
breathing
with
her
hand
and
dream
from
melancholy
part
wrests
the
wand
and
on
this
lady
heart
looked

so
deep
poor

has
rocked
himself
to

upon
the

blossom
of
her

himself
for
the

thou

i

the

oh
pardon
that
i

of
thee

the

that

oh
you

dear
lady
quite
nor
know

as

the

me
for

is
captivity
what

no

limits
not

the
desire
we
therefore
with
a

instinctive
mind
an
equal
spaciousness
of
bondage
find
in
confines
far
or
near
of
air
or
our

longings
which
affront
the

most
richly

of
their
flaming
spears

a

restrainless

overscroll
with

the

contented
with

my

beat
the
whole
world
through
flag
on
the
confines
of
the
sun
and
you
and
find
the
human
pale
remoter
of
the

after
her
going
the

i
walk
indeed
in
her
or
even
for
nothing
of
me
or
around

absent
she
did
leaven

in
my
body
as
its
soul
and
in
my
soul
its

ah
me
my
very
flesh
turns
soul
essenced
i
sighed
with
bliss
and
the
blackbird
held
his
lutany
all
with
bliss
and
all
things
stilled
were
as
a
maid
sweet
with
a
single
kiss
for
grief
of
perfect
fairness
eve
could
nothing
do
but
smile
the
time
was
far
too
perfect
fair
being
but
for
a
while
and
ah
in
me
too
happy
grief
blinded
herself
with
smile
the
sunset
at
its
radiant
heart
had
somewhat
unconfest
the
bird
was
loath
of
speech
its
song
on
its
breast
and
made
melodious
toyings
with
a
note
or
two
at
best
and
she
was
gone
my
sole
my
fair
ah
sole
my
fair
was
gone
methinks
throughout
the
world
right
i
had
been
sad
alone
and
yet
such
sweet
in
all
things
heart
and
such
sweet
in
my
own
miscellaneous
poems
a
fallen
yew
it
seemed
corrival
of
the
world
great
prime
made
to
the
scythe
of
time
and
last
with
stateliest
rhyme
no
tender
dryad
ever
did
indue
that
rigid
chiton
of
rough
yew
to
fret
her
white
flesh
through
but
some
god
like
to
those
grim
asgard
lords
who
walk
the
fables
of
the
hordes
from
scandinavian
fjords
upheaved
its
stubborn
girth
and
raised
unriven
against
the
and
the
levin
defiant
arms
to
heaven
when
doom
puffed
out
the
stars
we
might
have
said
it
would
decline
its
heavy
head
and
see
the
world
to
bed
for
this
firm
yew
did
from
the
vassal
leas
and
rain
and
air
its
tributaries
its
revenues
increase
and
levy
impost
on
the
golden
sun
take
the
blind
years
as
they
might
run
and
no
fate
seek
or
shun
but
now
our
yew
is
strook
is
fallen
yea
hacked
like
dull
wood
of
every
day
to
this
and
that
men
say
never
to
hades
shadowy
shipyards
gone
dim
barge
of
dis
down
acheron
it
drops
or
lethe
wan
stirred
by
its
fall
poor
destined
bark
of
dis
along
my
soul
a
bruit
there
is
of
echoing
images
reverberations
of
mortality
spelt
backward
from
its
death
to
me
its
life
reads
saddenedly
its
breast
was
hollowed
as
the
tooth
of
eld
and
boys
there
creeping
unbeheld
a
laughing
moment
dwelled
yet
they
within
its
very
heart
so
crept
reached
not
the
heart
that
courage
kept
with
winds
and
years
beswept
and
in
its
boughs
did
close
and
kindly
nest
the
birds
as
they
within
its
breast
by
all
its
leaves
caressed
but
bird
nor
child
might
touch
by
any
art
each
other
or
the
tree
hid
heart
a
whole
god
breadth
apart
the
breadth
of
god
the
breadth
of
death
and
life
even
so
even
so
in
undreamed
strife
with
pulseless
law
the
wife
the
sweetest
wife
on
sweetest
their
soul
at
grapple
in
sweet
to
her
sweet
may
say
i
take
you
to
my
inmost
heart
my
true
ah
fool
but
there
is
one
heart
you
shall
never
take
him
to
the
hold
that
falls
not
when
the
town
is
got
the
heart
heart
whose
immurèd
plot
hath
keys
yourself
keep
not
its
ports
you
can
not
burst
you
are
withstood
for
him
that
to
your
listening
blood
sends
precepts
as
he
would
its
gates
are
deaf
to
love
high
summoner
yea
love
great
warrant
runs
not
there
you
are
your
prisoner
yourself
are
with
yourself
the
sole

in
that
unleaguerable
fortress
it
knows
you
not

portress
its
keys
are
at
the

hung
of

its

by

its

if
his

shall
rock
those
floors
in
wrath
or
blest
aspersion
sleek
his
path
is
only
choice
it
hath
yea
in
that
ultimate

occult
abode
to
lie
as
in
an
oubliette
of
god
or
in
a
bower
untrod
built
by
a
secret
lover
for
his

sole
choice
is
this
your
life
allows
sad
tree
whose
perishing
boughs
so
few
birds
house
the
hound
of
heaven
i
fled
him
down
the
nights
and
down
the
days
i
fled
him
down
the
arches
of
the
years
i
fled
him
down
the
labyrinthine
ways
of
my
own
mind
and
in
the
mist
of
tears
i
hid
from
him
and
under
running
laughter
up
vistaed
hopes
i
sped
and
shot
precipitated
adown
titanic
glooms
of
chasmèd
fears
from
those
strong
feet
that
followed
followed
after
but
with
unhurrying
chase
and
unperturbèd
pace
deliberate
speed
majestic
instancy
they
beat
and
a
voice
beat
more
instant
than
the
feet
all
things
betray
thee
who
betrayest
me
i
pleaded
by
many
a
hearted
casement
curtained
red
trellised
with
intertwining
charities
for
though
i
knew
his
love
who
followèd
yet
was
i
sore
adread
lest
having
him
i
must
have
naught
beside
but
if
one
little
casement
parted
wide
the
gust
of
his
approach
would
clash
it
to
fear
wist
not
to
evade
as
love
wist
to
pursue
across
the
margent
of
the
world
i
fled
and
troubled
the
gold
gateways
of
the
stars
smiting
for
shelter
on
their
clangèd
bars
fretted
to
dulcet
jars
and
silvern
chatter
the
pale
ports
o
the
moon
i
said
to
dawn
be
sudden
to
eve
be
soon
with
thy
young
skiey
blossoms
heap
me
over
from
this
tremendous
lover
float
thy
vague
veil
about
me
lest
he
see
i
tempted
all
his
servitors
but
to
find
my
own
betrayal
in
their
constancy
in
faith
to
him
their
fickleness
to
me
their
traitorous
trueness
and
their
loyal
deceit
to
all
swift
things
for
swiftness
did
i
sue
clung
to
the
whistling
mane
of
every
wind
but
whether
they
swept
smoothly
fleet
the
long
savannahs
of
the
blue
or
whether
they
clanged
his
chariot
a
heaven
plashy
with
flying
lightnings
round
the
spurn
o
their
feet
fear
wist
not
to
evade
as
love
wist
to
pursue
still
with
unhurrying
chase
and
unperturbèd
pace
deliberate
speed
majestic
instancy
came
on
the
following
feet
and
a
voice
above
their
beat
naught
shelters
thee
who
wilt
not
shelter
me
i
sought
no
more
that
after
which
i
strayed
in
face
of
man
or
maid
but
still
within
the
little
children
eyes
seems
something
something
that
replies
at
least
are
for
me
surely
for
me
i
turned
me
to
them
very
wistfully
but
just
as
their
young
eyes
grew
sudden
fair
with
dawning
answers
there
their
angel
plucked
them
from
me
by
the
hair
come
then
ye
other
children
nature
share
with
me
said
i
your
delicate
fellowship
let
me
greet
you
lip
to
lip
let
me
twine
with
you
caresses
wantoning
with
our
vagrant
tresses
banqueting
with
her
in
her
palace
underneath
her
azured
daïs
quaffing
as
your
taintless
way
is
from
a
chalice
out
of
the
dayspring
so
it
was
done
in
their
delicate
fellowship
was
one
drew
the
bolt
of
nature
secrecies
knew
all
the
swift
importings
on
the
wilful
face
of
skies
i
knew
how
the
clouds
arise
spumèd
of
the
wild
all
that
born
or
dies
rose
and
drooped
with
made
them
shapers
of
mine
own
moods
or
wailful
or
divine
with
them
joyed
and
was
bereaven
i
was
heavy
with
the
even
when
she
lit
her
glimmering
tapers
round
the
day
dead
sanctities
i
laughed
in
the
morning
eyes
i
triumphed
and
i
saddened
with
all
weather
heaven
and
i
wept
together
and
its
sweet
tears
were
salt
with
mortal
mine
against
the
red
throb
of
its
i
laid
my
own
to
beat
and
share
commingling
heat
but
not
by
that
by
that
was
eased
my
human
smart
in
vain
my
tears
were
wet
on
heaven
grey
cheek
for
ah
we
know
not
what
each
other
says
these
things
and
i
in
sound
speak
sound
is
but
their
stir
they
speak
by
silences
nature
poor
stepdame
can
not
slake
my
drouth
let
her
if
she
would
owe
me
drop
yon
blue
of
sky
and
show
me
the
breasts
o
her
tenderness
never
did
any
milk
of
hers
once
bless
my
thirsting
mouth
nigh
and
nigh
draws
the
chase
with
unperturbèd
pace
deliberate
speed
majestic
instancy
and
past
those
noisèd
feet
a
voice
comes
yet
more
fleet
lo
naught
contents
thee
who
not
me
naked
i
wait
thy
love
uplifted
stroke
my
harness
piece
by
piece
thou
hast
hewn
from
me
and
smitten
me
to
my
knee
i
am
defenceless
utterly
i
slept
methinks
and
woke
and
slowly
gazing
find
me
stripped
in
sleep
in
the
rash
lustihead
of
my
young
powers
i
shook
the
pillaring
hours
and
pulled
my
life
upon
me
grimed
with
smears
stand
amid
the
dust
o
the
mounded
years
my
mangled
youth
lies
dead
beneath
the
heap
my
days
have
crackled
and
gone
up
in
smoke
have
puffed
and
burst
as
on
a
stream
yea
faileth
now
even
dream
the
dreamer
and
the
lute
the
lutanist
even
the
linked
fantasies
in
whose
blossomy
twist
i
swung
the
earth
a
trinket
at
my
wrist
are
yielding
cords
of
all
too
weak
account
for
earth
with
heavy
griefs
so
overplussed
ah
is
thy
love
indeed
a
weed
albeit
an
amaranthine
weed
suffering
no
flowers
except
its
own
to
mount
ah
must
designer
infinite
ah
must
thou
char
the
wood
ere
thou
canst
limn
with
it
my
freshness
spent
its
wavering
shower
i
the
dust
and
now
my
heart
is
as
a
broken
fount
wherein
stagnate
spilt
down
ever
from
the
dank
thoughts
that
shiver
upon
the
sighful
branches
of
my
mind
such
is
what
is
to
be
the
pulp
so
bitter
how
shall
taste
the
rind
i
dimly
guess
what
time
in
mists
confounds
yet
ever
and
anon
a
trumpet
sounds
from
the
hid
battlements
of
eternity
those
shaken
mists
a
space
unsettle
then
round
the
turrets
slowly
wash
again
but
not
ere
him
who
summoneth
i
first
have
seen
enwound
with
glooming
robes
purpureal
his
name
i
know
and
what
his
trumpet
saith
whether
man
heart
or
life
it
be
which
yields
thee
harvest
must
thy
harvest
fields
be
dunged
with
rotten
death
now
of
that
long
pursuit
comes
on
at
hand
the
bruit
that
voice
is
round
me
like
a
bursting
sea
and
is
thy
earth
so
marred
shattered
in
shard
on
shard
lo
all
things
fly
thee
for
thou
fliest
me
strange
piteous
futile
thing
wherefore
should
any
set
thee
love
apart
seeing
none
but
i
makes
much
of
naught
he
said
and
human
love
needs
human
meriting
how
hast
thou
merited
of
all
man
clotted
clay
the
dingiest
clot
alack
thou
knowest
not
how
little
worthy
of
any
love
thou
art
whom
wilt
thou
find
to
love
ignoble
thee
save
me
save
only
me
all
which
i
took
from
thee
i
did
but
take
not
for
thy
harms
but
just
that
thou
seek
it
in
my
arms
all
which
thy
child
mistake
fancies
as
lost
i
have
stored
for
thee
at
home
rise
clasp
my
hand
and
come
halts
by
me
that
footfall
is
my
gloom
after
all
shade
of
his
hand
outstretched
caressingly
ah
fondest
blindest
weakest
i
am
he
whom
thou
seekest
thou
dravest
love
from
thee
who
dravest
me
to
the
dead
cardinal
of
westminster
i
will
not
perturbate
thy
paradisal
state
with
praise
of
thy
dead
days
to
the
say
spirit
thou
wert
fine
clay
this
do
thy
praise
who
knew
therefore
my
spirit
clings
heaven
porter
by
the
wings
and
holds
its
gated
golds
apart
with
thee
to
press
a
private
business
whence
deign
me
audience
anchorite
who
didst
dwell
with
all
the
world
for
cell
my
soul
round
me
doth
roll
a
sequestration
bare
too
far
alike
we
were
too
far
dissimilar
for
its
burning
fruitage
i
do
climb
the
tree
o
the
sky
do
prize
some
human
eyes
smelt
the
and
all
the
sweet
embosoms
the
dear
uranian
year
those
eyes
my
weak
gaze
shuns
which
to
the
suns
are
suns
did
not
affray
your
lid
the
carpet
was
let
down
with
golden
moultings
strown
for
you
of
the
angels
blue
but
i
the
shoulder
of
your
christ
find
high
to
lean
thereby
so
flaps
my
helpless
sail
bellying
with
neither
gale
of
heaven
nor
orcus
even
life
is
a
coquetry
of
death
which
wearies
me
too
sure
of
the
amour
a
where
i
death
divers
garments
try
till
fit
some
fashion
sit
it
seemeth
me
too
much
i

rehearse
for
such
a

single
scene
the
sandy

bear
antique
remembrancer
my
veins
do
spare
its
pains
with
secret
sympathy
my
thoughts
repeat
in
me
infirm
the

o
the
worm
beneath
my
appointed
sod
the

in
my

i
shake
to
winds
that

thereon
that
drop
perturb
with
drip
acerb
my
subtly
answering
soul
the
feet
across
its
knoll
do
jar
me
from
afar
as
sap
foretastes
the
spring
as
earth
ere
blossoming
thrills
with
far
daffodils
and
feels
her
breast
turn
sweet
with

unconceivèd
wheat
so
doth
my

foreloathe
the

no

with
curse
of

what

serve
for
such
sad

reserve
given
in

the

deaf

the

its

bosom
wherethrough

seems
and
thou
the

hour
strikes
on
yon
golden
gong
in
tones
of
floating
and
mellow
light
a
spreading
summons
to
see
how
there
the
cowlèd
night
kneels
on
the
eastern
what
is
this
feel
of
incense
everywhere
clings
it
round
folds
of
the
clouds
upwafted
by
the
solemn
thurifer
the
mighty
spirit
unknown
that
swingeth
the
slow
earth
before
the
embannered
throne
or
the
season
under
all
these
shrouds
of
light
and
sense
and
silence
makes
her
known
a
presence
everywhere
an
inarticulate
prayer
a
hand
on
the
soothed
tresses
of
the
air
but
there
is
one
hour
scant
of
this
titanian
primal
liturgy
as
there
is
but
one
hour
for
me
and
thee

thee

yellow
spark

spark
beneath
the
dreadful
catafalque
of
the

i
had
ended
there

a
great
wind
blew
all
the
stars
to
flare
and
cried
i
sweep
a
path
before
the
moon
tarry
ye
now
the
coming
of
the
moon
for
she
is
coming
soon
then
died
before
the
coming
of
the
moon
and
she
came
forth
upon
the
trepidant
air
in
vesture
woven
as
woof
of
and
curdled
as
of
the
vapour
at
the
feet
of
her
and
a
haze
about
her
tinged
in
fainter
wise
as
if
she
had
trodden
the
stars
in
press
till
the
gold
wine
spurted
over
her
dress
till
the
gold
wine
gushed
out
round
her
feet
spouted
over
her
stainèd
wear
and
bubbled
in
golden
froth
at
her
feet
and
hung
like
a
whirlpool
mist
round
her
still
mighty

here
my

this

the
lover

decuman
billow
of

who
feels
his
feet
sink
in
some
sudden
hollow
of
sweet

love
usèd
converse
comes
sharp
on
a

all
joy
sums
an

fine
compendium

beating
thick
at
the

the

such
icarian
fall
saved
by
her
confidence
that
she
small
as
what
no

word

fit

uttered
best
by
opposite

in
the
tongue
of
hate
exprest
and
deepest
anguish
in

bates

just
happy
alien
little
things
what
of
all
words
is
in
excess
implies
in
a
sweet
nothingness
with
dailiest
babble
shows
her
sense
that
full
speech
were
full
impotence
and
while
she
feels
the
heavens
lie
bare
she
only
talks
about
her

ode
to
the
setting
sun
prelude
the
wailful
sweetness
of
the
violin

down
the
hushèd
waters
of
the

of
the
throbbing
harp

to
long
in
aching
music
in
wafts
that
poignant
sweetness
drifts
until
the
wounded
soul
ooze
sadness
the
red
sun
a
bubble
of
fire
drops
slowly
toward
the
hill
while
one
bird
prattles
that
the
day
is
done
o
setting
sun
that
as
in
reverent
days
sinkest
in
music
to
thy
smoothèd
sleep
discrowned
of
homage
though
yet
crowned
with
rays
hymned
not
at
harvest
more
though
reapers
reap
for
thee
this
music
wakes
not
o
deceived
if
thou
hear
in
these
thoughtless
harmonies
a
pious
phantom
of
adorings
reaved
and
echo
of
fair
ancient
flatteries
yet
in
this
field
where
the
cross
planted
reigns
i
know
not
what
strange
passion
bows
my
head
to
thee
whose
great
command
upon
my
veins
proves
thee
a
god
for
me
not
dead
not
dead
for
worship
it
is
too
incredulous
for
doubt
oh
too
what
wild
divinity
makes
my
heart
thus
a
fount
of
most
baptismal
tears
thy
straight
long
beam
lies
steady
on
the
cross
ah
me
what
secret
would
thy
radiant
finger
show
of
thy
bright
mastership
is
this
the
key
is
thy
secret
then
and
is
it
woe
fling
from
thine
ear
the
burning
curls
and
hark
a
song
thou
hast
not
heard
in
northern
day
for
rome
too
daring
and
for
greece
too
dark
sweet
with
wild
wings
that
pass
that
pass
away
ode
alpha
and
omega
sadness
and
mirth
the
springing
music
and
its
wasting
breath
the
fairest
things
in
life
are
death
and
birth
and
of
these
two
the
fairer
thing
is
death
mystical
twins
of
time
inseparable
the
younger
hath
the
holier
array
and
hath
the

it

that
trails
the

it
is
the
breaking
wave
that
hath
the

the

shower
that
rainbows
maniple
is
it
not
so
o
thou
day
that
thy
splendours
round
thee
in
thy
fall
high
was
thine
eastern
pomp
inaugural
but
thou
dost
set
in
statelier
pageantry

the

thou

thy

so
triumphally
i

do
those
lucent
palms
strew
thy
feet
failing
thicklier
than

who
dost
but
hood
thy
glorious

with
night
and
vex
the
heels
of
all
the
yesterdays
lo
this
loud
lackeying
praise
will
stay
behind
to
greet
the
usurping

disgrace
the

unsceptre

we
deny
thy
nod
we
can
not
spoil
thee
of
thy
divinity
what
know
we
elder
than
thee
when
thou
didst
bursting
from
the
great
void
husk
leap
like
a
lion
on
the
throat
o
the
dusk
when
the
angels
sang
to
each
other
the
vaulted
blaze
overhead
of
their
vast
pinions
spread
hailing
thee
brother
how
chaos
rolled
back
from
the
wonder
and
the
first
morn
knelt
down
to
thy
visage
of
thunder
thou
didst
draw
to
thy
side
thy
young
auroral
bride
and
lift
her
veil
of
night
and
mystery
tellus
with
baby
hands
shook
off
her
and
from
the
unswathèd
vapours
laughed
to
thee
thou
deity
nurse
at
once
and
sire
thou
genitor
that
all
things
nourishest
the
earth
was
suckled
at
thy
shining
breast
and
in
her
veins
is
quick
thy
milky
fire
who
scarfed
her
with
the
morning
and
who
set
upon
her
brow
the
carcanet
who
queened
her
front
with
the
enrondured
moon
who
dug
night
jewels
from
their
vaulty
mine
to
dower
her
past
an
eastern
wizard

when
hovering
on
him
through
his
all
the
rained
gems
of
the
old
tartarian
line
shiver
in
lustrous
throbbings
of
tinged
flame
whereof
a
moiety
in
the
paolis
seams
statelily
builded
their
venetian
name
thou
hast
enwoofèd
her
an
empress
of
the
air
and
all
her
births
are
propertied
by
thee
her
teeming
centuries
drew
being
from
thine
eyes
thou
the
marrow
of
all
quality
who
lit
the
furnace
of
the
mammoth
heart
who
shagged
him
like
pilatus
ribbèd
flanks
who
raised
the
columned
ranks
of
that
old
forestry
which
like
a
continent
torn
oppressed
the
sea
when
the
ancient
heavens
did
in
rains
depart
while
the
whirls
of
the
tossed
scud
made
hiss
thy
drenchèd
curls
thou
the
enormous
brood
who
hast
with
life
imbued
the
lion
maned
in
tawny
majesty
the
tiger
the
pard
and
the
lithe
panther
flexuous

how
came
the
entombèd
tree
a
though
sunk
in
lightless
lair
friend
of
the
forgers
of
earth
mate
of
the
earthquake
and

volcanic
clasped
in

of
the

titanic
which
rock
like

the

of
the

swart
son
of
the
swarthy
mine
when
flame
on
the
breath
of
his
nostrils
feeds
how
is
his
countenance
like
thee
in
thy
sanguine
weeds
thou
gavest
him
his
light
though
sepulchred
in
night
beneath
the
dead
bones
of
a
perished
world
over
his
prostrate
form
though
cold
and
heat
and
storm
the
mountainous
wrack
of
a
creation
hurled
who
made
the
splendid
rose
saturate
with
purple
glows
cupped
to
the
marge
with
beauty
a
whence
the
wind
vintages
gushes
of
warmèd
fragrance
richer
far
than
all
the
flavorous
ooze
of
cyprus
vats

in

gale
which
waves
her
green
cymar
with
dusky
cheeks
burnt

sways
her
heavy

drunk
with
the

of
her
own
odorousness

in
a

the

it
not
thou
that

the

who
hast
snowed
the

and
her

the

sultry
her

with
flame
thou
thy
sceptred
beam
all
delight
and

beauty
is
beautiful
but
in
thy
glance
and
like
a
jocund
maid
in
arrayed
before
thy
ark
earth
keeps
her
sacred
dance
and
now
o
shaken
from
thine
antique
throne
and
sunken
from
thy
coerule
empery
now
that
the
red
glare
of
thy
fall
is
blown
in
smoke
and
flame
about
the
windy
sky
where
are
the
wailing
voices
that
should
meet
from
hill
stream
grove
and
all
of
mortal
shape
who
tread
thy
gifts
in
vineyards
as
stray
feet
pulp
the
globed
weight
of
juiced
iberia
grape
where
is
the
threne
o
the
sea
and
why
not
dirges
thee
the
wind
that
sings
to
himself
as
he
makes
stride
lonely
and
terrible
on
the
andéan
height
where
is
the
naiad
her
sworded
sedge
the
nymph
by
her
wan
fount
verge
the
dryad
at
timid
gaze
by
the
the
oread
jutting
light
on
one
sole
from
the
the
nereid
on
the
scud
o
the
surge
with
whistling
tresses
dank
athwart
her
face
and
all
her
figure
poised
in
lithe
circean
grace
why
withers
their
lament
their
tresses
have
they
sighed
hence
with
trailing
o
sweet
o
sad
o
fair
i
catch
your
flying
hair
draw
your
eyes
down
to
me
and
dream
on
them
a
space
and
they
fleet
from
me
must
ye
fade
o
old
essential
candours
ye
who
made
the
earth
a
living
and
a
radiant
thing
and
leave
her
corpse
in
our
strained
cheated
arms
lo
ever
thus
when
song
with
chorded
charms
draws
from
dull
death
his
lost
eurydice
lo
ever
thus
even
at
consummating
even
in
the
swooning
minute
that
claims
her
his
even
as
he
trembles
to
the
impassioned
kiss
of
reincarnate
beauty
his
control
clasps
the
cold
body
and
foregoes
the
soul
whatso
looks
lovelily
is
but
the
rainbow
on
life
weeping
rain
why
have
we
longings
of
immortal
pain
and
all
we
long
for
mortal
woe
is
me
and
all
our
chants
but
chaplet
some
decay
as
mine
this
vanishing
nay
vanished
day
the
low
dusks
to
a
leaden
hue
no
rift
disturbs
the
heavy
shade
and
chill
save
one
where
the
charred
firmament
lets
through
the
scorching
dazzle
of
heaven
which
the
hill
sombrely
stands
black
as
life
against
eternity
against
eternity
a
rifting
light
in

burns
through

no

the

to
angry
red
thou
dost
image
thou
dost
follow
that
of
creation
who
ere

hailed
apollo
gave
thee
thy
station
thou
art
of
him
a
type
memorial
like
him
thou
in
dreadful
pomp
of
blood
upon
thy
western
rood
and
his
stained
brow
did
veil
like
thine
yet
lift
once
more
its
light
and
risen
again
departed
from
our
ball
but
when
it
set
on

arose
in
heaven
thus
hath
he
unto
death
his
beauty
given
and
so
of
all
which
form
inheriteth
the
fall
doth
pass
the
rise
in
worth
for
birth
hath
in
itself
the
germ
of
death
but
death
hath
in
itself
the
germ
of
birth
it
is
the
falling
acorn
buds
the
tree
the
falling
rain
that
bears
the
greenery
the
moulder
when
the
ferns
arise
for
there
is
nothing
lives
but
something
dies
and
there
is
nothing
dies
but
something
lives
till
skies
be
fugitives
till
time
the
hidden
root
of
change
updries
are
birth
and
death
inseparable
on

for
they
are
twain

one

death
is
birth
now
with
wan
ray
that
other
sun
of
song
sets
in
the
bleakening
waters
of
my
soul

and
lo
the
cross
stands
gaunt
and
long
me
and

a

even
so
o
cross
thine
is
the
victory
thy
roots
are

emanate
in

from
thee
here
thy
dread
symbol
only
shadow
yields
of
reapèd
joys
thou
art
the
heavy
sheaf
which
must
be
lifted
though
the
reaper
groan
yea
we
may
cry
till
heaven
great
ear
be
deaf
but
we
must
bear
thee
and
must
bear
alone

this

thee

questioning

to
us
as

like

who
hear
newly
their

history
unthought
before
and

she
is
not
as
we

ah
me
we
are
beguiled
what
art
thou
then
that
art
not
our
conceiving
art
thou
not
too
old
for
thy
young
children
or
perchance
thou
a
youth
beyond
thy
sons
decrepit
it
is
long
since
time
was
first
a
fledgling
yet
thou
be

as
a

against

bosom
swung
alack
for
that
we
seem
indeed
to
have
slipped
the

great
and
come
upon
thy
pinched
and
dozing
days
these
weeds
these
corporal
leavings
thou
not
us
new
fresh
from
thy
craftship
like
the
lilies
coats
but
us
off
with
hasty
tarnished
piecings
negligent

from

ancestral
wearings
that

with

some
of
us
that
if

may
have
free
leave
our

go
out
at

we
are
sad
with
more
than
our
sires
heaviness
and
with
more
than
their
weakness
weak
we
shall
not
be
mighty
with
all
their
mightiness
nor
shall
not
rejoice
with
all
their
joy
ay
mother
mother
what
is
this
man
thy
darling
kissed
and
cuffed
thou
lustingly
to
sweat
and
make
his
brag
and
rot
crowned
with
all
honour
and
all
shamefulness
from
nightly
towers
he
dogs
the
secret
footsteps
of
the
heavens
sifts
in
his
hands
the
stars
weighs
them
as
and
yet
is
he
successive
unto
nothing
but
patrimony
of
a
little
mould
and
entail
of
four
planks
thou
hast
made
his
mouth
avid
of
all
dominion
and
all
mightiness
all
sorrow
all
delight
all
topless
grandeurs
all
beauty
and
all
starry
majesties
and
dim
transtellar
things
even
that
it
may
filled
in
the
ending
with
a
puff
of
dust
confess
it
is
enough
the
world
left
empty
what
that
poor
mouthful
crams
his
heart
is
builded
for
pride
for
potency
infinity
all
heights
all
deeps
and
all
immensities
arrased
with
purple
like
the
house
of
kings
to
stall
the

the

lodge
mother
of

sayer
of
dark

in

who

so

we
ourselves
thy
darkest
we
the

in
a
little
thought
in
a
little
thought
at
last
confront
thee
and
ourselves
in
thee
and
wake
disgarmented
of
glory
as
one
on
a
mount
standing
and
against
him
stands
on
the
mount
adverse
crowned
with
westering
rays
the
golden
sun
and
they

each

faring
down

the

his

contemplation
this

i
fled
the

the

reclining
in

lull
of

the

pursuing
not

stretched
out
naked
after

or
so
it
seemed

were
still
nor
was
there
any
purpose
on
the
hill
the
hill
which
sometimes
visibly
is
wrought
with
unresting
energies
looked
idly
from
the
musing
wood
and
every
rock
a
life
renewed
exhaled
like
an
unconscious
thought
when
poets
dreaming
unperplexed
dream
that
they
dream
of
nought
nature
one
hour
appears
a
thing
unsexed
or
to
such
serene
balance
brought
that
her
twin
natures
cease
their
sweet
alarms
and
sleep
in
one
another
arms
the
sun
with
resting
pulses
seems
to
brood
and
slacken
its
command
upon
my
unurged
blood
the
river
has
not
any
care
its
passionless
water
to
the
sea
to
bear
the
leaves
have
brown
content
the
wall
to
me
has
freshness
like
a
scent
and
takes
half
animate
the
air
making
one
life
with
its
green
moss
and
stain
and
life
with
all
things
seems
too
perfect
blent
for
anything
of
life
to
be
aware
the
very
shades
on
hill
and
tree
and
plain
where
they
have
fallen
doze
and
where
they
doze
remain
no
hill
can
idler
be
than
i
no
stone
its
vibration
investeth
with
a
stiller
lie
no
heaven
with
a
more
urgent
rest
betrays
the
eyes
that
on
it
gaze
we
are
too
near
akin
that
thou
shouldst
cheat
me
nature
with
thy
fair
deceit
in
poets
floating
like
a
upon
the
bosom
of
the
glassy
hour
in
skies
that
no
man
sees
to
move
lurk
untumultuous
vortices
of
power
for
joy
too
native
and
for
agitation
too
instant
too
entire
for
sense
thereof
motion
like
gnats
when
autumn
suns
are
low
perpetual
as
the
prisoned
feet
of
love
on
the
heart
floors
with
painèd
pace
that
go
from
stones
and
poets
you
may
know
nothing
so
active
is
as
that
which
least
seems
so
for
he
that
conduit
running
wine
of
song
then
to
himself
does
most
belong
when
he
his
mortal
house
unbars
to
the
importunate
and
thronging
feet
that
round
our
corporal
walls
unheeded
beat
till
all
containing
he
exalt
his
stature
to
the
stars
or
stars
narrow
their
heaven
to
his
fleshly
vault
when
like
a
city
under
ocean
to
human
things
he
grows
a
desolation
and
is
made
a
habitation
for
the
fluctuous
universe
to
lave
with
unimpeded
motion
he
scarcely
frets
the
atmosphere
with
breathing
and
his
body
shares
the
immobility
of
rocks
his
heart
a
of
tranquillity
his
mind
more
still
is
than
the
limbs
of
fear
and
yet
its
unperturbed
velocity
the
spirit
of
the
simoon
mocks
he
round
the
solemn
centre
of
his
soul
wheels
like
a
dervish
while
his
being
is
streamed
with
the
set
of
the
world
harmonies
in
the
long
draft
of
whatsoever
sphere
he
lists
the
sweet
and
clear
clangour
of
his
high
orbit
on
to
roll
so
gracious
is
his
heavenly
grace
and
the
bold
stars
does
hear
every
one
in
his
airy
soar
for
evermore
shout
to
each
other
from
the
peaks
of
space
as
thwart
ravines
of
azure
shouts
the
mountaineer

o
nothing
in

that
to
the

of
his

responds
with

with

lack

floated
as
they
were

on

lulled
on
the

she
has
chidden
in
a
pet
all
her

from

now
they
wander

through

now
they

illustration
of
francis
such
pronouncements
proved
at
least
that
a
poet
who
had
no
friend
save
such
as
his
published
poems
gained
for
him
could
count
on
an
immediate
recognition
for
high
merit
for
these
tributes
and
many
more
of
like
welcoming
placed
him
instantly
out
of
range
of
the
common
casualties
of
criticism
from
note
on
francis
thompson
xii
the
writer
of
the
note
has
not
attempted
a
critical
estimate
of
the
poetry
some
of
these
appreciations
forming
a
part
of
the
poet
and
even
of
the
literary
history
of
his
time
are
here
mr
francis
thompson
is
a
writer
whom
it
is
impossible
that
any
qualified
judge
should
deny
to
be
a
new
poet
and
while
most
poets
of
his
quality
have
usually
to
wait
a
quarter
of
a
century
or
more
for
adequate
recognition
this
poet
is
pretty
sure
of
a
wide
and
immediate
acknowledgement
we
find
that
in
these
poems
profound
thought
splendour
of
imagery
and
discernment
of
those
analogies
which
are
the
roots
of
the
poet
language
abound
qualities
which
ought
to
place
him
in
the
permanent
ranks
of
fame
with
cowley
and
with
crashaw
hound
of
has
so
great
and
passionate
and
such
a
motive
that
we
are
carried
over
all
obstructions
of
the
rhythmical
current
and
are
compelled
to
pronounce
it
at
the
end
one
of
the
very
few
great
odes
of
which
the
language
can
boast
in
a
lesser
degree
this
passion
prevails
in
the
seven
remarkable
pieces
called
in
dian
poems
of
which
laura
might
have
been
proud
and
lucretia
not
ashamed
to
have
had
addressed
to
her
the
main
region
of
mr
thompson
poetry
is
the
inexhaustible
and
hitherto
almost
unworked
mine
of
catholic
philosophy
not
but
that
he
knows
better
than
to
make
his
religion
the
direct
subject
of
any
of
his
poems
unless
it
presents
itself
to
him
as
a
human
passion
and
the
most
human
of
passions
as
it
does
in
the
splendid
ode
just
noticed
in
which
god
long
pursuit
and
final
conquest
of
the
resisting
soul
is
described
in
a
torrent
of
as
humanly
impressive
verse
as
was
ever
inspired
by
a
natural
affection
mr
thompson
places
himself
by
these
poems
in
the
front
rank
of
the
pioneers
of
the
movement
which
if
it
be
not
checked
as
in
the
history
of
the
world
it
has
once
or
twice
been
checked
before
by
premature
formulation
and
by
popular
and
profane
perversion
must
end
in
creating
a
new
heaven
and
a
new
earth
coventry
patmore
in
fortnightly
it
is
not
only
the
religious
ecstasy
of
crashaw
that
they
recall
for
all
the
daringly
fantastic
imagery
all
the
hyperbole
all
that
strange
mixture
and
artifice
of
spontaneous
passion
and
studied
conceit
which
were
so
characteristic
of
the
age
of
crashaw
are
with
the
same
astonishing
fidelity
reproduced
where
unless
perhaps
in
here
and
there
a
sonnet
of
rossetti
has
this
sort
of
sublimated
enthusiasm
for
the
bodily
and
spiritual
beauty
of
womanhood
found
such
expression
as
in
in
dian
between
the
age
of
the
stuarts
and
our
own
to
realize
the
full
extent
to
which
the
religious
or
emotions
now
ecstatic
now
dominate
and
colour
the
entire
fabric
of
these
strange
poems
they
must
be
read
throughout
in
the
lines
the
dead
cardinal
of
we
see
them
at
their
subtlest
and
in
the
very
powerful
piece
hound
of
a
poem
setting
forth
the
pursuit
of
the
human
soul
by
divine
grace
they
are
at
their
most
intense
that
minority
who
can
recognize
the
essentials
under
the
accidents
of
poetry
and
who
feel
that
it
is
to
poetic
form
alone
and
not
to
forms
that
eternity
belongs
will
agree
that
alike
in
wealth
and
dignity
of
imagination
in
depth
and
subtlety
of
thought
and
in
magic
and
mastery
of
language
a
new
poet
of
the
first
rank
is
to
be
welcomed
in
the
author
of
this
h
traill
in
nineteenth
the
first
thing
to
be
done
and
by
far
the
most
important
is
to
recognize
that
we
are
here
face
to
face
with
a
poet
of
the
first
order
a
man
of
imagination
all
compact
a
seer
and
singer
of
rare
genius
he
revels
indeed
in
orgiac
imageries
and
revelry
implies
excess
but
when
excess
is
an
excess
of
strength
the
debauch
a
debauch
of
beauty
who
can
condemn
or
even
regret
it
would
we
had
a
few
more
poets
who
could
exceed
in
such
imagery
as
this
it
is
no
minor
caroline
singer
he
recalls
but
the
jacobean
daily
a
volume
of
poetry
has
not
appeared
in
queen
victoria
reign
more
authentic
in
greatness
of
utterance
than
this
in
the
rich
and
virile
harmonies
of
his
line
in
strange
and
lovely
vision
in
fundamental
meaning
he
is
possibly
the
first
of
victorian
poets
and
at
least
is
he
of
none
the
inferior
in
all
sobriety
do
we
believe
him
of
all
poets
to
be
the
most
celestial
in
vision
the
most
august
in
faculty
in
a
word
a
new
planet
has
swum
into
the
ken
of
the
watchers
of
the
poetic
skies
these
are
big
words
but
we
have
weighed
them
for
there
is
that
in
mr
francis
thompson
poetry
which
discourages
the
flamboyant
appreciations
of
the
more
facile
impressionist
and
gives
him
pause
in
his
enthusiasms
it
is
patent
on
the
first
page
that
there
is
genius
in
this
inspiration
and
the
great
note
in
this
utterance
but
page
after
page
reveals
the
rich
and
the
strange
and
the
richer
and
the
stranger
in
so
many
original
moods
and
noble
measures
that
the
reviewer
feels
the
necessity
of
caution
in
nothing
does
thompson
appear
more
authentically
a
poet
than
in
the
fact
that
his
sense
of
beauty
is
part
of
his
religion
in
this
he
is
like
shelley
except
that
shelley
sense
of
beauty
was
his
religion
and
lived
in
an
atmosphere
of
sensuousness
a
sensuousness
that
has
little
of
the
grosser
taints
of
earth
about
it
indeed
but
which
is
still
sensuousness
therefore
shelley
wrote
the
glorious
therefore
mr
thompson
writes
the
longest
and
greatest
poem
in
his
book
and
speaking
for
ourselves
we
shall
say
at
once
that
long
unique
in
the
language
has
at
last
found
its
parallel
perhaps
its
peer
in
of
this
her
of
mr
thompson
we
must
say
that
she
is
the
significance
of
his
book
if
his
sense
of
beauty
is
part
of
his
religion
his
religion
is
that
of
a
rapt
catholic
to
whom
the
very
heaven
with
all
that
therein
be
is
open
and
palpable
his
is
the
catholicism
of
profound
mysticism
and
of
the
most
universal
temper
it
is
perfectly
safe
to
affirm
that
if
mr
thompson
write
no
other
line
by
this
volume
alone
he
is
as
secure
of
remembrance
as
any
poet
of
the
century
his
vocabulary
is
very
great
mr
thompson
first
volume
is
no
mere
promise
it
is
itself
among
the
great
achievements
of
english
poetry
it
has
reached
the
peak
of
parnassus
at
a
bound
he
has
actually
accomplished
the
high
thing
in
metaphysical
poetry
that
donne
and
crashaw
only
dreamed
of
his
mysticism
is
infinitely
more
profound
and
significant
than
theirs
as
his
imagination
is
more
impulsive
ardent
and
beautiful
he
is
the
great
platonist
of
english
poetry
if
mr
thompson
had
never
written
anything
after
his
first
volume
there
would
be
but
one
stuart
poet
with
whom
the
author
of
could
be
compared
for
orchestral
majesties
of
song
and
that
one
milton
he
is
an
argonaut
of
literature
far
travelled
in
the
realms
of
gold
and
he
has
in
a
strange
degree
the
assimilative
mind
we
do
not
think
we
forget
any
of
the
splendid
things
of
an
english
anthology
when
we
say
that
hound
of
seems
to
us
on
the
whole
the
most
wonderful
lyric
in
the
language
it
fingers
all
the
stops
of
the
spirit
and
we
hear
now
a
thrilling
and
dolorous
note
of
doom
and
now
the
quiring
of
the
spheres
and
now
the
very
pipes
of
pan
but
under
all
the
still
sad
music
of
humanity
it
is
the
return
of
the
nineteenth
century
to
thomas
a
j
garvin
in
newcastle
and
in
the
fine
frenzy
and
the
fine
line
these
are
two
root
characteristics
of
mr
thompson
really
remarkable
poem
one
has
seldom
seen
poet
more
wildly
abandoned
to
his
rapture
more
absorbed
in
the
trance
of
his
ecstasy
when
the
irresistible
moment
comes
he
throws
himself
upon
his
mood
as
a
glad
swimmer
gives
himself
to
the
waves
careless
whither
the
strong
tide
carries
him
knowing
only
the
wild
joy
of
the
laughing
waters
and
the
rainbow
spray
he
shouts
as
it
were
for
mere
gladness
in
the
welter
of
wonderful
words
and
he
dives
swift
and
fearless
to
fetch
his
fancies
when
weak
men
venture
on
these
vagaries
they
drown
but
mr
thompson
is
a
strong
swimmer
hyperboles
which
in
other
hands
had
seemed
merely
absurd
in
his
delight
us
as
examples
of
that
fine
excess
which
is
one
of
the
most
enthralling
of
the
many
enchantments
of
poetry
indeed
mr
thompson
must
simply
be
crashaw
born
again
but
born
greater
though
the
conception
for
example
of
hound
of
the
case
of
a
sinner
fleeing
from
the
love
of
christ
is
exactly
in
crashaw
vein
yet
it
was
not
in
his
power
to
have
suggested
such
tremendous
speed
and
terror
of
flight
as
whirls
through
every
line
of
mr
thompson
r
le
gallienne
in
daily
a
new
poet
and
this
time
a
major
and
not
a
minor
one
on
the
section
called
in
dian
much
might
be
said
of
its
extraordinary
conception
and
workmanship
the
section
is
one
long
beautiful
song
of
praise
and
even
worship
of
one
whom
the
poet
calls
his
dear
administress
but
surely
never
was
woman
worshipped
with
more
utter
chastity
of
passion
whether
her
portrait
in
or
regarding
her
as
poet
breaking
or
only
reflecting
on
her
wearing
of
a
new
dress
the
poet
is
so
full
of
fine
matter
and
so
adoring
in
his
expression
of
it
as
to
bring
dante
himself
to
james
here
are
dominion
domination
over
language
and
a
sincerity
as
of
robert
burns
the
epithet
sublime
has
been
sadly
stained
and
distorted
by
comic
writers
and
there
is
a
danger
in
applying
it
in
its
honest
light
without
warning
this
safeguard
established
we
have
to
say
that
in
our
opinion
mr
thompson
poetry
at
its
highest
attains
a
sublimity
unsurpassed
by
any
victorian
poet
a
sublimity
which
will
stand
the
hideous
test
of
extracts
in
a
constant
interchange
of
symbol
between
earthly
and
heavenly
beauty
pulses
like
day
and
john
davidson
in
when
at
the
end
of
there
appeared
a
little
quarto
volume
of
poems
by
francis
thompson
the
english
world
of
letters
experienced
an
agreeable
shock
of
surprise
it
was
as
if
a
rocket
had
been
sent
up
into
a
dark
night
his
poems
have
all
the
pomp
and
prodigality
of
imagination
for
which
gray
frugal
muse
words
and
cadences
must
have
had
an
intoxication
for
him
the
intoxication
of
the
scholar
and
cloudy
trophies
were
continually
falling
into
his
hands
and
half
through
them
in
his
hurry
to
seize
and
brandish
them
he
swung
a
rare
incense
in
a
censer
of
gold
under
the
vault
of
a
chapel
where
he
had
hung
votive
offerings
when
he
chanted
in
his
chapel
of
dreams
the
airs
were
often
airs
which
he
had
learnt
from
crashaw
and
from
patmore
they
came
to
life
again
when
he
used
them
and
he
made
for
himself
a
music
which
was
part
strangely
familiar
and
part
his
own
almost
bewilderingly
such
and
such
orchestration
of
sound
were
heard
nowhere
else
and
people
listened
to
the
music
entranced
as
by
a
new
magic
the
genius
of
francis
thompson
was
oriental
exuberant
in
colour
woven
into
elaborate
patterns
and
went
draped
in
old
silk
robes
that
had
survived
many
dynasties
the
spectacle
of
him
was
an
enchantment
he
passed
like
a
wild
vagabond
of
the
mind
dazzling
our
sight
he
had
no
message
but
he
dropt
sentences
by
the
way
cries
of
joy
or
pity
love
of
children
worship
of
the
virgin
and
the
saints
and
of
those
who
were
patron
saints
to
him
on
earth
his
voice
was
heard
like
a
wandering
music
which
no
one
heeded
for
what
it
said
in
a
strange
tongue
but
which
came
troublingly
into
the
mind
bringing
it
the
solace
of
its
old
recaptured
arthur
symons
in
saturday
to
read
mr
francis
thompson
then
is
like
setting
sail
with
drake
or
hawkins
in
search
of
new
worlds
and
golden
spoils
he
has
the
magnificent
elizabethan
manner
the
splendour
of
conception
the
largeness
of
katherine
in
as
a
matter
of
fact
such
fact
as
one
kisses
the
book
to
in
a
court
of
law
it
was
in
a
railway
carriage
on
my
way
back
to
london
that
i
first
read
mr
thompson
poem
mistress
of
but
in
such
truth
as
would
pass
anywhere
but
in
a
court
of
law
it
was
at
cambridge
in
the
height
of
the
summer
term
and
in
a
fellows
garden
that
the
revelation
first
came
i
thought
then
in
my
enthusiasm
that
no
such
poem
had
been
written
or
attempted
since
coleridge
attempted
and
left
off
writing
in
a
cooler
hour
i
think
so
yet
and
were
my
age
or
so
it
would
delight
me
to
swear
to
it
riding
to
any
man
drawbridge
who
shuts
his
gates
against
it
and
blowing
the
horn
of
challenge
it
is
verily
a
wonderful
poem
hung
like
a
fairy
tale
in
middle
air
a
sleeping
palace
of
beauty
set
in
a
glade
in
the
heart
of
the
woods
of
westermain
surprised
there
and
recognized
with
a
gasp
as
satisfying
and
summarizing
a
thousand
youthful
longings
after
beauty
to
me
also
my
admiration
seemed
too
hot
to
last
but
four
or
five
years
leave
me
unrepentant
it
seemed
to
me
to
be
more
likely
to
be
a
perishable
joy
because
i
had
once
clutched
at
and
seemed
to
grasp
similar
beauties
in
poe
mr
thompson
thought
always
strong
often
runs
into
phrases
of
exquisite
sweetness
and
exquisite
clarity
the
lines
beginning
firm
is
the
man
and
set
beyond
the
cast
of
fortune
game
and
the
iniquitous
hour
are
worthy
to
be
remembered
beside
daniel
to
the
countess
of
sir
quiller
couch
q
in
daily
thompson
poetry
is
a
wassail
of
orgiac
imageries
he
is
a
poet
like
shelley
and
blake
in
order
to
follow
him
as
he
soars
from
image
to
image
and
symbol
to
symbol
you
must
have
the
rare
wings
of
imagination
thompson
mixes
his
metaphors
so
wisely
that
they
illumine
each
other
strange
light
shooting
out
of
their
weltering
chaos
like
the
radiance
of
phosphorescent
waves
he
troubles
you
with
sudden
pictures
that
flash
out
against
the
blackness
this
gift
of
dreadful
vision
is
not
found
in
crashaw
or
in
patmore
in
donne
or
in
herbert
and
therefore
it
seems
to
me
that
thompson
is
essentially
more
akin
to
blake
coleridge
and
rossetti
than
to
the
ecclesiastical
mystics
he
is
a
mystic
with
a
james
douglas
in
morning
great
poets
are
obscure
for
two
opposite
reasons
now
because
they
are
talking
about
something
too
large
for
anyone
to
understand
and
now
again
because
they
are
talking
about
something
too
small
for
anyone
to
see
francis
thompson
possessed
both
these
infinities
he
was
describing
the
evening
earth
with
its
mist
and
fume
and
fragrance
and
represented
the
whole
as
rolling
upwards
like
a
smoke
then
suddenly
he
called
the
whole
ball
of
the
earth
a
thurible
and
said
that
some
gigantic
spirit
swung
it
slowly
before
god
this
is
the
case
of
the
image
too
large
for
comprehension
another
instance
sticks
in
my
mind
of
the
image
which
is
too
small
in
one
of
his
poems
he
says
that
the
abyss
between
the
known
and
the
unknown
is
bridged
by
pontifical
death
there
are
about
ten
historical
and
theological
puns
in
that
one
word
that
a
priest
means
a
pontiff
that
a
pontiff
means
a
that
death
is
certainly
a
bridge
that
death
may
turn
out
after
all
to
be
a
reconciling
priest
that
at
least
priest
and
bridges
both
attest
to
the
fact
that
one
thing
can
get
separated
from
another
thing
these
ideas
and
twenty
more
are
all
tacitly
concentrated
in
the
word
pontifical
in
francis
thompson
poetry
as
in
the
poetry
of
the
universe
you
can
work
infinitely
out
and
out
but
yet
infinitely
in
and
in
these
two
infinities
are
the
mark
of
greatness
and
he
was
a
great
g
chesterton
in
illustrated
london
thompson
used
his
large
vocabulary
with
a
boldness
and
especially
a
recklessness
almost
a
frivolity
in
rhyme
that
were
worthy
of
browning
on
the
other
hand
these
rugged
points
were
at
a
further
view
absorbed
into
the
total
effect
of
beauty
in
a
manner
which
browning
never
achieved
for
the
poet
entirely
free
from
timidity
in
matters
of
poetic
form
relied
not
on
chastity
or
perfection
of
detail
but
on
the
perfervid
rush
of
his
genius
which
simply
carried
his
readers
over
the
rough
places
here
was
a
large
utterance
large
in
bulk
in
speed
in
a
lavish
disregard
of
economy
and
yet
what
could
not
for
a
moment
be
mistaken
was
that
the
poetry
was
at
once
great
and
sincere
these
written
in
praise
of
two
little
sisters
contain
a
number
of
lovely
and
most
musical
lines
and
some
passages
such
as
the
seventh
section
of
the
first
poem
which
spenser
would
not
have
the
greater
a
poet
message
the
more
profound
his
thought
the
larger
his
range
and
the
more
exquisite
his
note
the
deeper
and
more
incessant
will
be
his
demand
upon
his
reader
that
is
why
the
great
poets
have
had
to
wait
for
their
recognition
only
the
few
will
or
can
at
the
beginning
but
they
are
the
leaven
and
now
whole
masses
can
see
the
poetic
purport
of
shelley
coleridge
keats
and
wordsworth
of
whom
the
contemporary
criticism
was
a
thing
over
which
you
laugh
or
cry
as
the
mood
has
you
those
who
see
in
mr
francis
thompson
an
authentic
poet
have
at
any
rate
the
profound
interest
of
watching
the
various
stages
in
the
making
of
their
immortal
how
have
the
portents
followed
the
precedent
afforded
by
the
poets
just
named
in
general
very
accurately
we
think
the
common
attitude
of
critics
towards
them
and
him
has
been
very
similar
in
the
case
of
shelley
it
is
so
near
in
its
very
wording
as
to
be
sometimes
startling
extravagances
and
novelties
of
diction
a
toppling
over
of
images
and
obscurity
of
course
that
were
dwelt
upon
by
objectors
very
just
objectors
no
doubt
who
busied
and
troubled
about
details
lost
all
sense
of
proportion
and
had
no
ear
for
the
great
and
ultimate
meaning
of
the
poet
message
the
note
that
comes
most
majestically
from
mr
thompson
is
that
of
the
reconciliation
of
the
two
natures
and
destinies
of
man
to
that
literal
oneness
wordsworth
groped
in
his
merely
kindred
points
of
heaven
and
home
of
that
oneness
rossetti
has
the
hint
and
coventry
patmore
the
full
vision
mr
thompson
is
the
heir
of
the
poets
and
he
has
entered
fully
into
his
inheritance
he
has
not
picked
their
flowers
and
worn
them
fading
their
seed
has
passed
into
his
life
and
they
have
blossomed
no
other
among
the
younger
poets
so
effectually
proclaimed
a
mastery
of
the
grand
style
none
other
had
so
securely
occupied
a
position
on
the
right
side
of
the
line
which
for
ever
separates
inspiration
from
talent
poetry
from
agreeable
verse
he
appeared
on
the
scene
fully
equipped
there
were
no
long
years
of
public
neglect
or
production
of
volumes
which
lay
unnoticed
on
the
bookstalls
before
being
cast
into
the
dust
heap
the
marvellous
splendour
of
his
first
volume
revealed
a
writer
of
no

order
with
a
secureness
of
touch
a
magical

all
