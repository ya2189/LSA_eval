of

swept
over

as
on

a

that
steered
into

stood

felt
the
awe
upon
my

death
and
destiny

all
that

ii
the

blew

iii
and
is
all
well
o
thou
unweariable
launcher
of
worlds
upon
bewildered
space
rose
in
me
all
or
did
thy
hand
grow
dull
building
this
world
that
bears
a
piteous
race
o
was
it
launched
too
soon
or
launched
too
late
or
can
it
be
a
derelict
that
drifts
beyond
thy
ken
toward
some
reef
of
fate
on
which
oblivion
sand
forever
shifts
iv
the
sea
grew
softer
as
i
questioned
calm
with
mystery
that
like
an
answer
moved
and
from
infinity
there
fell
a
balm
the
old
peace
that
god
tho
all
unproved
the
old
faith
that
tho
gulfs
sidereal
stun
the
soul
and
knowledge
drown
within
their
deep
there
is
no
world
that
wanders
no
not
one
of
all
the
millions
that
he
does
not
keep
the
proselyte
recants
where
the
fair
golden
idols
sit
in
darkness
and
in
silence
while
the
temple
drum
beats
solemnly
and
slow
where
the
tall
cryptomerias
sway
in
worship
round
about
and
the
rain
that
is
falling
whispers
low
i
can
hear
strange
voices
of
the
dead
and
forgotten
on
the
dimly
rising
incense
i
can
see
the
lives
i
have
lived
and
my
lives
unbegotten
amida
pity
me
i
was
born
this
karma
of
a
mother
in
chuzenji
where
looks
down
into
the
lake
where
the
pilgrims
climb
to
altars
in
the
clouds
and
behold
the
holy
eastern
dawn
awake
it
was
there
i
wandered
till
a
priest
of
the
christians
with
the
crucifix
he
wore
compelled
my
gaze
in
grief
i
had
grown
so
upon
its
grief
i
pondered
amida
keep
my
days
it
was
wrong
he
told
me
to
pray
jiso
for
my
children
and
binzuru
for
healing
of
my
ills
and
our
gods
so
many
were
conceived
he
said
in
sin
from
lord
shaka
to
the
least
upon
the
hills
in
despair
i
listened
for
my
heart
beat
hopeless
not
a
temple
of
my
land
had
helped
me
live
but
alas
that
day
when
i
let
my
soul
be
christened
amida
o
forgive
for
the
christ
they
gave
me
as
the
only
law
and
lotus
as
the
only
way
to
light
that
will
not
wane
may
perchance
have
power
for
the
people
of
the
west
but
to
me
he
seemed
the
servitor
of
pain
for
in
pain
he
perished
as
one
born
to
passion
in
some
other
life
no
doubt
his
sin
was
great
tho
they
told
me
no
those
who
followed
him
and
cherished
amida
such
is
fate
so
again
to
idols
of
the
buddha
who
is
boundless
while
the
temple
drum
is
beating
thro
the
rain
i
have
turned
from
treason
into
meditation
truth
from
the
strife
the
western
god
regards
as
gain
and
if
now
i
dying
as
the
voices
tell
me
to
the
lives
that
i
must
live
i
meekly
go
till
my
long
grief
ends
in
nirvana
and
my
sighing
amida
be
it
so
love

japan
i
lighting
on
the
whose
soul
do
you
hear
on
the
day
of
the
dead
the
soul
of
my
lover
ah
me
the
plighting
between
two
hearts
that
were
never
wed
quickly
the
priest
is
coming
oh
the
boom
of
the
bitter
bell
now
you
are
gone
and
my
tears
fall
thickly
how
of
heaven
do
the
gods
make
hell
ii
the

maple
leaves
on

the
summer
has
come
the
summer
has
gone
and
the
maple
leaves
lift
fairy
hands
that
ripple
upon
the
winds
of
dawn
where
the
dim
pagoda
stands
they
ripple
and
beckon
yearningly
to
their
sister
fairies
over
the
sea
but
help
comes
not
so
they
fall
and
flee
from
autumn
over
the
sands
and
down
the
mountain
and
into
the
tide
some
are
blown
where
the
sampans
glide
and
some
are
strewn
by
the
temple
side
and
some
by
the
torii
but
autumn
ever
pursues
them
till
as
ever
before
she
has
her
will
and
leaves
them
desolate
dead
and
still
ravished
afar
and
wide
leaves
them
desolate

typhoon
i
was
weary
and
slept
on
the
peak
the
air
clung
close
like
a
shroud
and
ever
the
buzz
in
my
ear
hung
haunting
and
hot
and
loud
i
awoke
and
the
sky
was
dun
with
awe
and
a
dread
that
soon
went
shuddering
thro
my
heart
for
i
knew
that
it
meant
typhoon
typhoon
in
the
harbour
below
far
down
the
junks
like
fowl
in
a
flock
were
tossing
in
wingless
terror
or
fled
fluttering
in
from
the
shock
the
city
a
breathless
bend
of
roofs
by
the
water
strewn
lay
silent
and
waiting
yet
there
was
none
within
it
but
said
typhoon
then
it
came
like
a
million
winds
gone
mad
immeasurably
a
torrid
and
tortuous
tempest
stung
by
rape
of
the
fair
south
sea
and
it
swept
like
a
scud
escaped
from
craters
of
sun
or
moon
and
struck
as
no
power
of
heaven
could
or
of
hell
typhoon
typhoon
and
the
junks
were
smitten
and
torn
the
drowning
struggled
and
cried
or
dashed
on
the
granite
walls
of
the
sea
in
succourless
hundreds
died
till
i
shut
the
sight
from
my
eyes
and
prayed
for
my
soul
to
swoon
if
ever
i
see
god
face
let
it
be
guiltless
of
that
typhoon
penang
i
want
to
go
back
to
singapore
and
ship
along
the
straits
to
a
bungalow
i
know
beside
penang
where
cocoanut
palms
along
the
shore
are
waving
and
the
gates
of
peace
shut
sorrow
out
forevermore
i
want
to
go
back
and
hear
the
surf
come
beating
in
at
night
like
the
washing
of
eternity
over
the
dead
i
want
to
see
dawn
fare
up
and
day
go
down
in
golden
light
i
want
to
go
back
to
penang
i
want
to
go
back
i
want
to
go
back
to
singapore
and
up
along
the
straits
to
the
bungalow
that
waits
me
by
the
tide
where
the
tamil
and
malay
tell
their
lore
at
evening
and
the
fates
have
set
no
soothless
canker
at
life
core
i
want
to
go
back
and
mend
my
heart
beneath
the
tropic
moon
while
the
is
whispering
thoughts
of
sleep
i
want
to
believe
that
earth
again
with
heaven
is
in
tune
i
want
to
go
back
to
penang
i
want
to
go
back
i
want
to
go
back
to
singapore
and
ship
along
the
straits
to
the
bungalow
i
left
upon
the
strand
where
the
foam
of
the
world
grows
faint
before
it
enters
and
abates
in
meaning
as
i
hear
the
pour
i
want
to
go
back
and
end
my
days
some
evening
when
the
cross
on
the
southern
sky
hangs
heavily
far
and
sad
i
want
to
remember
when
i
die
that
life
elsewhere
was
loss
i
want
to
go
back
to
penang
i
want
to
go
back
when
the
wind
is
low
when
the
wind
is
low
and
the
sea
is
soft
and
the
far
plays
on
the
rim
of
the
west
where
dark
clouds
nest
on
a
darker
bank
of
haze
when
i
lean
the
rail
with
you
that
i
love
and
gaze
to
my
heart
content
i
know
that
the
heavens
are
there
above
but
you
are
my
firmament
when
the
are
thrown
from
the
bow
and
the
watch
climbs
up
the
shroud
when
the
dim
mast
dips
as
the
vessel
slips
thro
the
foam
that
seethes
aloud
i
know
that
the
years
of
our
life
are
few
and
fain
as
a
bird
to
flee
that
time
is
as
brief
as
a
drop
of
dew
but
you
are
eternity

the
high
in

tinkle
with
low

tongue

grave
in
praise
of
lord
gautama
all
night
long
where
the
lone
spire
sends
its
golden
height
to
the
starry
light
he
hears
their
tune

watches
the

and
fears
he
shall
never
reach
nirvana
round
and
round
by
a
hundred
shrines
glittering
at
the
great
shwe
base
falls
the
sound
of
his
feet
mid
lines
droned
from
the
sacred
wisdom
round
and
round
where
the
idols
gaze
so
pitiless
on
his
pained
distress
he
passes
on
and
wan

pariah
like
the
dogs
behind
him
oh
what
sin
in
a
life
begot
thousands
of
lives
ago
did
he
sin
that
he
is
now
by
all
forgot
even
by

oh
what
sin
that
the
lowest
shun
his
very
name
as
a
thing
of
shame
a
sound
to
taint
the
winds
that
faint
from
the
high
bells
that
hear
it
uttered
midnight
comes
and
the
hours
of
morn
tapers
die
and
the
flowers
all
from
the
most
fêted
altars
lorn
and
desolate
is
their
odour
midnight
goes
but
he
watches
still
by

cold
spire

fire
by

silvery
calm

porch
pray
under

that
falls
in

flow
of
praise

faithless

with
illusive
feet
it
comes

late
to
ease
his
fate

all
the
sadness
that
fills
my
heart
to
hear
your
lover
cry
under
the
indian
stars
i
look
for
your
jasmine
tower
along
the
river
whose
barren
bed
lies
gray
beneath
the
moon
and
thro
its
magic
doors
you
seem
like
a
spirit
flower
wandering
back
from
allah
bourne
to
seek
for
some
lost
boon
under
the
indian
stars
i
see
you
softly
moving
among
your
maidens
there
a
sweet
and
ghostly
queen
and
the
scent
of
attar
flung
in
your
marble
font
seems
proving
that
passion
never
can
die
from
love
if
truly
love
has
been
under
the
indian
stars
comes
the
shadow
of
allah
jehan
the
lord
of
magnificence
the
liege
who
holds
your
heart
the
silver
doors
swing
back
and
alone
with
him
you
hallow
the
amorous
night
whose
moon
has
made
such
visions
in
me
start
under
the
indian
stars
but
the
end
of
all
is
moaning
i
hear
his
dying
breath
that
from
your
tomb
shall
never
die
for
every
jasper
flower
he
set
in
its
dream
seems
loaning
to
beauty
a
grief
mumtaz
mahal
and
unto
fate
a
sigh
love
cynic
i
o
you
poets
ever
pretending
love
is
immortal
pipe
the
truth
empty
your
books
of
lies
the
ending
of
no
passion
can
be
youth
heaven
you
breathe
will
join
the
broken
come
was
the
infinite
wed
that
he
must
evermore
be
thinking
of
your
wedding
bed
ii
pipe
the
truth
tho
it
clip
the
glamour
out
of
your
rhymes
and
rip
your
dream
do
you
believe
words
can
enamour
death
and
dry
up
lethe
stream
death
it
is
but
a
sponge
that
passes
one
the
appeaseless
will
squeeze
back
into
lethe
flood
whose
lasting
is
eternities
iii
false
cry
you
and
an
unbeseeming
blasphemy
well
look
around
is
it
not
only
in
blaspheming
truth
is
ever
to
be
found
whether
it
be
one
thing
i
ask
you
lovers
and
poets
tell
i
pray
was
there
ever
a
ended
ere
the
judgment
day
iv
o
you
answer
ill
is
in
all
things
but
in
an
ancient
lie
what
good
is
it
not
better
just
to
call
things
what
they
are
not
what
we
would
when
you
are
clinging
to
your
mistress
love
has
the
face
of
eternity
cling
to
her
then
but
know
that
wanting
fools
the
best
that
be
v
yet
her
brows
and
her
eyes
that
murmur
all
the
music
you
say
of
god
press
her
lips
but
a
little
firmer
you
will
feel
that
they
are
sod
but
there
is
living
soul
beyond
them
and
it
is
love
till
all
things
end
children
alone
build
paradises
with
but
pence
to
spend
vi
now
that
is
like
the
cynic
pitying
runs
your
he
has
sat
at
the
devil
clinic
with
some
dead
love
up
the
while
dead
or
alive
are
one
with
passions
under
the
potent
knife
of
truth
they
will
be
seen
composed
of
craving
and
a
little
ruth
vii
then
the
world
on
a
lie
is
living
many
a
lie
has
filled
its
maw
better
illusion
tho
than
giving
faith
to
a
fatal
loveless
law
there
is
a
certain
socratean
saying
that
swine
of
their
ditch
are
sure
yet
do
they
prove
by
their
contentment
that
it
will
endure
viii
clasp
her
close
but
the
truth
is
in
you
tho
you
have
rhymed
and
rammed
it
down
hid
it
with
that
win
you
wreaths
that
you
know
bedeck
the
clown
kings
they
will
call
you
and
uplifters
of
your
kind
lord
save
the
mark
that
we
are
still
for
fire
dependent
on
so
false
a
spark
ix
and
so
fond
for
you

immortal
what
has
been
born
a
day

it
was

your

has
god
to
heed
and
you
he
with
his
thrice
three
million
thirsting
worlds
in
the
throes
of
death
and
life
surely
has
time
to
spare
for
choosing
your
behooven
wife
x
by
my
faith
there
is
not
a
creature
mad
as
a
poet
pants
the
breeze
give
him
a
mistress
and
he
preach
her
as
creation
masterpiece
let
him
but
lean
for
half
an
hour
over
her
lips
and
he
will
swear
that
he
would
dive
thro
death
unfathomed
to
regain
her
there
xi
and
believe
that
his
oath
is
able
that
there
is
not
in
all
the
sea
water
enough
to
quench
the
fable
of
his
soul
intensity

there
was
never
a
rose

blossomed

endured
beyond
its

there
was
never
a
fire
enkindled

the
great
cold
had
its

the

more
of

khamsin
in
a
shroud

swept
the
libyan
waste
across
to

thick
with

drouth
of
death

smote
the

bones
on

city
soft
and
fair
by
the
desert
edge
and
on
the
dim
blue
edge
of
the
sea
where
white
gulls
wing
all
day
and
fledge
their
young
on
the
high
cliff
sandy
ledge
there
is
a
city
i
have
beheld
sometime
or
where
by
day
or
dream
i
know
not
which
for
it
seems
enspelled
as
i
am
by
its
memory
pale
minarets
of
the
prophet
pierce
above
it
into
the
white
of
the
skies
and
sails
enchanted
a
thousand
years
flit
at
its
feet
while
fancy
steers
no
face
of
all
its
faces
to
me
is
known
no
passion
of
it
or
pain
it
is
but
a
city
by
the
sea
enshrined
forever
beyond
my
eyes
via
amorosa
when
we
two
walk
my
love
on
the
path
the
moon
makes
over
the
sea
to
the
end
of
the
world
where
sorrow
hath
an
end
that
is
ecstasy
should
we
not
think
of
the
other
road
of
wearying
dust
and
stone
our
feet
would
fare
did
each
but
care
to
follow
the
way
alone
when
we
two
slip
at
night
to
the
skies
and
find
one
star
that
we
keep
as
a
to
which
our
eyes
may
lead
our
souls
ere
sleep
should
we
not
pause
for
a
little
space
and
think
how
many
must
sigh
because
they
gaze
over
starry
ways
with
no
by
when
we
two
then
lie
down
to
our
dreams
that
deepen
still
the
delight
of
our
wandering
where
stars
and
streams
stray
in
immortal
light
should
we
not
grieve
with
the
myriads
from
east
of
earth
to
west
who
lay
them
down
at
night
but
to
drown
the
longing
for
some
loved
breast
ah
yes
for
life
has
a
thousand
gifts
but
love
it
is
gives
life
who
walks
thro
his
world
alone
lifts
a
soul
that
is
but
they
to
whom
it
is
given
to
tread
the
and
not
sink
can
ever
say
the
unhappiest
way
earth
has
is
fair
to
the
brink
dusk
at
hiroshima
softly
the
bamboo
bends
as
the
sun
sinks
down
unglowing
softer
the
willow
ends
a
sigh
to
the
dusk
around
quickly
the
brief
bat
wends
his
flittering
way
thro
flowing
fields
of
the
autumn
air
that
are
husht
of
the
city
sound
temple
and
thatch
and
stream
are
forgetting
the
light
that
lingers
mountain
and
mist
in
dream
already
are
lost
afar
faintingly
comes
the
beam
of
the
moon
then
viewless
fingers
tinkle
a
samisen
and
astir
on
the
east
is
a
star
the
wanderer
when
moonlight
on
the
face
of
the
great
buddha
falls
as
he
sits
in
nirvana
on
the
shores
of
kamakura
when
the
pines
about
him
place
soft
shadows
at
his
feet
like
offerings
of
penitence
and
tears
i
hear
in
the
grace
of
the
wind
low
susurra
a
voice
that
calls
me
still
to
my
home
within
the
west
but
i
lingered
overlong
in
the
east
strange
arcana
and
no
more
is
there
desire
within
my
breast
i
left
it
when
a
boy
that
far
home
and
alas
was
so
fair
that
my
dreaming
earth
had
fairer
was
a
madness
i
left
it
for
the
joy
of
wandering
the
world
and
lands
have
i
beheld
but
when
at
last
cloy
of
delight
brought
sadness
like
lotus
to
my
veins
and
forgetfulness
seemed
fate
i
had
fared
unto
this
shrine
and
the
moon
as
now
was
beaming
and
here
have
i
awaited
and
await
but
not
for
any
gift
of
its
god
or
any
grace
that
in
living
or
in
dying
men
in
text
or
sutra
sigh
for
and
not
for
any
shrift
nirvana
has
or
skies
where
paradise
imperishably
smiles
but
only
for
the
sift
of
the
wind
that
seems
to
die
for
my
soul
enduring
peace
in
the
dwelling
of
the
tomb
and
only
for
the
drift
of
the
moon
that
comes
denying
eternity
to
everything
but
doom
in
a
shinto
temple
garden
under
the
torii
robed
in
green
the
old
priest
creeps
to
the
shrine
over
the
bridge
the
still
stork
stands
the
crow
caws
not
in
the
pine
far
in
the
distance
bugles
blow
war
bloody
memory
wakes
the
priest
prays
on
for
his
sons
that
are
dead
and
the
heart
within
him
breaks
far
fujiyama
against
the
phantom
gold
of
failing
skies
i
see
the
ghost
of
fujiyama
rise
and
think
of
the
innumerable
eyes
that
have
beheld
its
vision
the
peasant
in
his
field
of
rice
or
tea
the
prince
in
gardens
dreaming
by
the
sea
the
priest
to
whom
the
sêmi
in
the
tree
was
but
some
shrilling
soul
incarnate
sound
and
as
i
think
upon
them
lo
the
trance
of
backward
time
and
distant
circumstance
of
karma
necromance
lies
suddenly
before
my
boundless
sight
it
is
as
if
a
moment
buddhahood
were
given
to
me
as
if
understood
at
last
were
vague
nirvana
vaguer
good
as
if
time
were
dissolved
in
living
light
on
miyajima
mountain
out
on
the
sea
the
sampans
ride
and
the
mountains
brim
with
mist
and
sun
o
we
are
in
japan
again
and
the
spell
is
about
us
spun
the
spell
of
the
old
enchanting
east
of
buddha
and
many
a
blissful
priest
the
spell
that
has
never
never
ceased
to
haunt
us
glad
we
behold
the
and
the
lanterns
in
religious
row
standing
like
acolytes
of
stone
where
the
pine
and
camphor
grow
and
them
the
old
pagoda
prays
blessing
upon
their
dreaming
days
and
upon
the
eightfold
sacred
ways
from
sorrow
ah
and
the
torii
too
is
there
where
the
tranced
sea
enters
to
his
shrine
daily
with
tidal
mystery
and
majesty
divine
he
enters
now
as
the
nuptial
sea
of
love
first
entered
our
hearts
to
be
lord
of
their
tides
eternally
and
master
old
age
i
have
heard
the
wild
geese
i
have
seen
the
leaves
fall
there
was
frost
last
night
on
the
garden
wall
it
is
gone
and
i
hear
the
wind
call
the
wind
that
is
all
if
the
swallow
will
light
when
evening
is
near
if
the
crane
will
not
scream
like
a
soul
in
fear
i
will
think
no
more
of
the
dying
year
and
the
wind
its
seer
on
the
down
the
junk
and
tatterdemalion
sampan
glide
sails
of
brown
and
black
and
yellow
swinging
down
the
junks
and
gaudy
take
the
tide
forth
to
the
sea
in
sloth
they
ride
the
coolies
singing
off
in
the
field
the
peasant
toils
and
along
the
canal
the
low
tows
slip
fruit
of
the
red
persimmon
piled
upon
them
off
in
the
field
the
peasant
toils
with
lip
and
brow
the
dull
years
strip
bare
of
the
dreams
of
life
whose
grip
has
grimly
drawn
them
high
on
the
hill
the
yamên
rests
and
the
temple
beside
it
sleeps
in
sun
far
in
the
distance
faints
the
city
dreary
high
on
the
hill
the
yamên
rests
and
dun
dead
shadows
it
run
this
is
the
land
where
time
begun
and
now
grows
weary
the
the
wild
led
by
the
wind
are
following
in
our
wake
shouting
millions
moving
on
they
have
broken
their
camp
of
calm
and
the
world
rebellion
make
with
banner
of
cloud
and
mist
above
them
drawn
they
have
heard
the
call
of
infinite
death
the
ordering
of
his
word
arise
go
forth
and
conquer
where
ye
can
for
that
is
the
only
law
ye
know
its
mandate
men
have
heard
let
them
beware
when
they
your
path
would
span
let
them
beware
for
i
am
lord
of
all
that
on
earth
has

and
unto
you
is
given
most
my
might
ride
on
ye
have
many
a
ship
to
rend
and
many
a
mast
to
maim
and
many
a
land
to
lash
and
soul
to
fright
so
on
they
ride
a
ravaging
horde
from
shore
to
shuddering
shore
beyond
us
in
the
bleak
dawn
nor
know
that
when
they
have
camped
again
and
sleep
life
will
restore
unto
her
world
the
hope
they
have
withdrawn
the
christian
in
exile
the
palms
along
the
old
fort
wall
are
paling
the
mountains
in
the
evening
light
are
red
the
moon
has
dropped
into
the
moat
from
heaven
a
spell
barbaric
over
all
is
spread
but
what
is
that
to
him
a
stranger
lonely
in
a
land
strange
to
all
his
faith
and
dim
he
cares
not
for
old
splendours
he
would
only
hear
on
the
air
a
simple
sabbath
hymn
the
their
snowy
flight
are
taking
from
the
tall
tamarind
unto
their
nest
the
along
the
road
are
creaking
the
bugles
the
wall
are
sounding

on
a
calm
jetty
looking
off
to
mecca
sons
of
mahomet
watch
the
low
day
rim
he
too
is
waiting
for
it
with
an
echo
upon
his
lips
of
a
believer
hymn
the
red
rise
against
the
twilight
the
palace
of
the
heathen
king
is
hid
the
white
bridge
bent
across
the
moat
beside
it
seems
now
of
all
unholinesses
rid
he
wishes
it
were
so
with
all
this
city
whose
pagodas
skyward
swim
but
he
can
only
gaze
on
them
and
pity
and
sing
within
his
heart
a
christian
hymn
the
parsee
woman
cast
me
out
from
among
you
i
will
not
see
my
child
laid
aloft
where
the
vultures
may
clamour
for
him
wild
the
earth
you
say
is
holy
not
to
be
soiled
by
death
and
a
parsee
still
should
hold
divine
what
zoroaster
saith
ay
and
so
i
will
hold
it
but
see
his
pale
sweet
face
as
pure
as
the
palest
flower
left
dead
in
spring
embrace
the
sun
we
worship
daily
shrined
it
for
seven
years
then
shall
it
go
to
cruel
beaks
there
where
the
veers
no
no
no
tho
you
send
me
a
beggar
from
your
door
you
my
lord
whom
i
honour
and
you
his
sisters
four
to
whom
there
have
come
no
children
to
make
your
bosoms
feel
how
even
a
thought
so
full
of
throe
can
make
my
sick
brain
reel
ah
you
are
deaf
you
scorn
me
and
loathe
as
a
thing
defiled
my
lord
i
am
but
a
woman
who
longs
to
see
her
child
laid
in
a
tomb
entreasured
under
the
shrouding
sod
o
would
i
had
never
given
birth
or
that
earth
had
no
god
shah
jehan
to
mumtaz
mahal
i
see
as
in
a
pale
mirage
the
palm
that
you
sways
the
waters
of
the
jumna
wan
are
beating
one
like
a
taj
a
dome
of
grief
betrays
its
beauty
as
was
yours
will
be
too
fleeting
the
world
is
wider
than
i
knew
now
that
your
face
is
gone
while
you
were
here
no
destiny
seemed
boundless
so
i
am
lost
and
find
no
clue
to
any
dusk
or
dawn
life
has
become
a
quest
decayed
and
groundless
come
back
come
back
or
let
me
find
the
jungle
leads
at
last
unto
your
lips
and
bosom
recreated
o
somewhere
i
again
must
wind
my
arms
about
you
cast
into
one
word
my
love
all
unabated
princess
jehanara
where
the
road
leads
from
delhi
to
the
south
and
dingy
creep
in
the
dust
past
of
old
firozabad
and
indropat
unpitied
of
the
drouth
by
a
lone
tree
above
a
pool
whose
sad
all
the
trust
is
a
tomb
and
on
it
just
a
few
faint
blades
of
bent
and
grieving
grass
jehanara
it
is
with
ready
mouth
a
moslem
tells
the
stranger
once
she
said
covering
of
the
poor
is
only
grass
let
it
be
mine
alone
when
i
am
dead
and
who
has
stood
there
where
about
her
rest
rise
high
imperial
tombs
knows
hers
is
best
a
singhalese
love
lament
as
the
that
pines
my
love
away
from
the
sound
of
the
planter
voice
am
i
for
i
hear
no
more
resound
your
song
by
the
sea
the
sun
may
come
and
the
moon
wax
round
and
in
its
beam
my
mates
may
rejoice
but
i
feast
not
and
my
heart
is
dumb
as
i
long
o
long
for
thee
in
the
where
the
cobra
creeps
the
leopard
lies
in
wait
for
me
but
o
my
love
when
the
daylight
dies
there
is
more
to
my
dread
than
he
harsh
lonely
tears
that
assail
my
eyes
are
worse
to
bear
for
the
misery
that
makes
them
well
is
the
long
long
years
that
i
moan
away
from
thee
o
again
again
in
my
katamaran
would
i
push
to
your
palmy
door
again
would
i
hear
the
heave
and
hush
of
your
song
by
the
but
far
away
do
i
toil
and
crush
the
hopes
that
arise
at
my
sick
heart
core
for
never
near
does
it
come
the
day
that
draws
me
again
to
thee
on
the
arabian
gulf
from
a
far
minaret
of
faithful
cloud
a
of
the
sunset
cried
over
the
sea
that
swung
with
sultan
pride
allah
is
beauty
there
is
none
beside
allah
is
beauty
not
to
be
denied
by
death
or
any
infidel
and
every
wave
that
worshipped
every
one
under
the
mosque
of
heaven
arching
high
lifted
a
white
crest
with
assenting
sigh
and
answered
let
all
gods
but
allah
die
yea
let
all
gods
until
the
world
shall
cry
beauty
alone
is
left
under
the
sun
the
ramessid
upon
an
image
of
immortal
stone
seated
and
vast
the
moon
of
luxor
falls
lending
to
it
a
stillness
that
appals
a
mystery
osirian
and
strange
the
hands
outplaced
upon
the
knees
in
lone
and
placid
majesty
reveal
the
power
of
egypt
in
her
most
triumphal
hour
the
calm
of
tyranny
that
can
not
change
it
is
of
that
great
king
who
heard
the
cries
of
millions
toil
to
lift
him
to
the
skies
who
saw
them
perish
at
their
task
like
flies
yet
let
no
eye
of
pity
them
range
what
rue
then
if
his
desecrated
face
rots
now
at
cairo
in
a
mummy
case
immortal
foes
at
bedrashein
between
the
pyramids
i
saw
the
wingèd
sun
fold
up
his
pinions
and
sink
into
the
nether
world
dominions
where
set
sent
ill
on
the
egyptian
dead
i
saw
the
ancient
desert
that
outbids
the
nile
for
the
between
them
spread
fling
over
memphis
that
is
vanishèd
another
shroud
of
sand
then
bid
his
minions
the
winds
lie
down
upon
their
boundless
bed
i
saw
where
temples
vowed
to
serapis
and
granite
splendours
men
name
pharaonic
are
kept
by
time
in
silence
and
sardonic
concealment
mummied
in
deep
mystic
tombs
and
when
the
stars
came
out
in
quiet
bliss
i
heard
eternity
with
all
its
dooms
past
and
to
come
sound
softly
the
mnemonic
of
death
who
waits
all
worlds
that
life
enwombs
the
conscript
the
camel
at
the
old
sakiyeh
toils
around
and
round
aweary
is
he
of
the
nile
and
of
the
wailing
sound
of
the
slow
wheel
he
turns
all
day
to
lift
the
water
on
its
way
over
the
fields
of
ahmed
bey
that
with
green
grain
abound
aweary
is
he
too
of
fellàheen
who
compel
him
on
with
chanting
till
the
day
over
the
west
has
gone
for
the
bold
desert
was
he
made
the
bedouin
his
lord
to
aid
not
for
this
peasant
wheel
of
trade
that
ever
must
be
drawn
but
on
he
toils
while
dahabiyeh
and
dark
felucca
glide
below
him
on
the
glassy
flow
of
the
gray
river
tide
then
when
the
night
has
come
lies
down
in
sleep
the
servile
day
to
drown
like
all
whom
life
turns
with
a
frown
from
their
true
fate
aside
navis
ignota
lord
what
ship
goes
forth
i
see
her
setting
west
shall
she
have
thy
winds
aright
stars
to
guide
her
with
their
light
shall
she
sweep
the
seas
to
sight
of
land
and
awful
is
thy
and
none
can
chart
thy
shoals
when
storm
unassuaging
hath
blotted
sun
and
shall
she
lord
escape
the
scath
and
live
with
all
her
souls
for
it
is
a
beauteous
thing
that
ships
should
sail
the
sea
splendid
is
their
plunge
and
swing
into
waves
that
foam
and
fling
maelstroms
at
their
bows
to
bring
them
down
to
destiny
and
she
too
courageous
rides
away
into
the
gloom
now
her
lights
are
lost
in
tides
of
the
windy
spray
that
glides
thro
the
darkness
lord
abides
thy
dove
with
her
or
doom
i
shall
know
perhaps
some
day
or
knowing
not
recall
how
my
heart
was
fain
to
pray
for
a
ship
that
bravely
lay
to
her
task
o
lord
so
may
each
vessel
of
us
all
the
cross
of
the
sepulchre
within
the
holy
sepulchre
there
is
a
cross
uncounted
lips
have
kissed
millions
the
world
to
dust
has
long
dismissed
millions
that
now
hope
of
it
but
to
die
pilgrims
i
saw
from
out
far
fervid
lands
of
superstition
north
and
west
and
south
bend
to
it
each
a
trembling
reverent
mouth
then
kneel
where
christ
was
said
to
loose
death
bands
and
then
i
wondered
if
he
who
believed
in
the
one
god
were
wounded
sore
by
this
whether
he
shrinks
at
each
ecstatic
kiss
or
knowing
how
humanity
is
grieved
knows
too
that
it
is
better
to
give
hope
than
truth
if
only
one
is
in
man
scope
the
nun
a
lone
palm
leans
in
the
moonlight
over
a
convent
wall
the
sea
below
is
waking
and
breaking
with
quiet
heave
and
fall
a
young
nun
sits
at
the
window
for
heaven
she
is
too
fair
yet
even
the
dove
of
god
might
nest
in
her
bosom
beating
there
a
lone
ship
sails
from
the
harbour
whom
does
it
bear
away
her
lover
who
has
parted
and
left
her
but
to
pray
she
has
no
lover
nor
ever
has
heard
afar
love
sigh
only
the
convent
vesper
vow
has
ever
dimmed
her
eye
for
naught
knows
she
of
her
beauty
more
than
the
palm
of
its
peace
and
who
beyond
christ
portal
to
mortal
desires
would
bend
her
knees
the
ways
of
the
world
have
flowers
and
any
who
will
pluck
those
but
let
there
ever
be
a
place
where
none
may
pluck
god
rose
alpine
chant
i
tramping
thro
the
mountains
they
are
rising
white
around
me
snow
peaks
like
patriarchs
that
winter
has
enthroned
i
tramping
up
the
valleys
where
the
cataracts
sound
me
thunders
they
have
shrilly
from
eternity
intoned
i
tramping
thro
the
mountains
with
the
clouds
for
my
companions
soft
clouds
that
float
and
cling
from
crag
to
cloven
crag
i
passing
by
the
chalets
that
the
high
cañons
passing
where
the
shepherds
and
the
flocks
they
pipe
to
lag
i
tramping
thro
the
mountains
where
the
pines
in
proud
procession
climb
like
a
hardy
host
to
of
sun
i
listening
for
the
sallies
of
the
avalanche
hessian
hurl
of
ice
and
granite
into
gulfs
avernian
i
tramping
thro
the
mountains
and
the
wind
is
yodling
to
me
yearnings
of
the
glaciers
to
flow
to
summer
lands
i
treading
up
the
valleys
with
no
wanting
to
undo
me
for
i
goalless
and
the
great
god
understands
the
man
of
might
no
moment
drooped
between
his
thought
and
action
no
morrow
died
between
his
dream
and
deed
within
his
soul
there
was
no
fatal
faction
that
could
betray
him
in
his
hour
of
need
in
time
of
awe
the
fierce
over
the
world
springs
like
a
wounded
spirit
the
waves
all
day
have
hissed
and
hurled
their
fangs
and
the
spray
has
swept
and
swirled
and
ships
in
the
gray
gale
lair
have
furled
their
sails
well
may
they
fear
it
the
night
will
be
but
a
monstrous
seethe
of
terrors
elemental
the
clouds
will
wrap
in
a
ghastly
wreath
of
gloom
the
winds
that
in
them
breathe
and
all
that
lives
in
the
sea
beneath
by
fear
shall
be
made
gentle
and
sink
down
down
to
the
nether
deeps
below
the
foam
and
fretting
down
where
the
sullen
water
sleeps
alway
and
the
slow
sand
coldly
creeps
over
the
lone
wreck
which
death
keeps
to
guard
him
forgetting
and
there
in
the
ominous
vast
calm
they
harbour
like
enchanted
chill
shapes
he
has
strangely
conjured
from
the
silence
of
his
masterdom
there
float
till
again
they
feel
the
qualm
of
hunger
thro
them
panted
and
then
once
more
far
up
will
they
spring
to
drift
and
sport
and
plunder
shark
eel
and
whale
and
with
tooth
to
rend
and
tail
to
sting
to
the
sea
o
god
does
horror
cling

haunting
past
all
wonder
sunrise
in
utah
the
dun
that
break
the
desert
sea
rose
suddenly
upon
my
sight
at
dawn
and
terrible
in
an
eternity
of
death
took
silently
the
sunrise
on
purple
funereal
from
rifted
skies
swept
down
across
their
proud
sterility
only
to
die
as
here
all
glory
dies
on
barrenness
i
did
not
dream
could
be
o
god
for
a
or
opening
lips
of
but
one
flower
upon
the
fatal
air
for
but
the
voice
of
water
as
it
drips
or
stir
of
leaves
the
makes
aware
o
god
for
these
for
life

from
the

the

so
irreparable

come
to
me
shadows
down
the
hill
lie
softly
at
my
feet
the
sun
has
worked
his
will
and
the
day
is
done
come
to
me
softly
and
distil
your
dews
and
dreams
that
heat
and
hours
of
heartless
glare
have
overrun
ii
come
to
me
shadows
down
the
hill
and
bring
with
you
the
night
and
the
whippoorwill
and
ah
the
moon
whose
soft
interpretings
can
still
the
tangled
tongues
of
right
and
wrong
and
hope
and
fear
that
haunt
the
noon
iii
come
to
me
shadows
down
the
hill
and
let
there
follow
sleep
which
is
god
tidal
will
that
overflows
the
world
obliterating
ill
and
in
its
soothing
sweep
murmuring
more
of
mercy
than
man
knows

the
evening
sails
come
home
with
twilight
in
their

across

the

the

begin
to
tell
the
sea
weaving
within
their
ancient
spell
more
than
earth
lore
the
rising
moon
wafts
strange
low
lures
across
the
tide
on
which
my
dim
thoughts
seem
to
range
stride
upon
stride
until
with
flooding
thrill
they
seem
at
last
to
blend
with
waves
that
from
the
eternal
will
wend
without
end
vis

there
is
no
day
but
leads
me
to
a
peak
impossible
to
scale
a
task
at
which
my
hands
must
fail
a
sea
i
can
not
swim
or
sail
there
is
no
night
i
suffer
thro
but
destiny
rules
stern
and
pale
and
yet
what
i
am
meant
to
do
i
will
do
ere
death
drop
his
veil
and
it
shall
be
no
little
thing
tho
to
oblivion
it
fall
for
i
shall
strive
to
it
thro
all
that
can
imperil
or
appal
so
at
each
morning
i
mount
again
less
slave
and
thrall
and
at
the
barriers
gladly
fling
a
fortitude
that
scorns
to
crawl
meredith
what
am
i
reading
he
is
dead
he
the
great
interpreter
and
seer
england
noblest
head
what
am
i
reading
it
is
hushed
the
deepest
voice
that
life
had
found
to
read
a
century
profound
with
all
time
seethe
and
stir
why
it
is
but
a
scanty
score
of
days
since
at
his
side
clasping
his
hand
with
more
than
pride
i
felt
that
the
immortal
tide
of
his
great
mind
would
long
break
the
cold
command
of
death
still
in
my
ear
is
echoing
the
surf
of
his
strong
words
and
still
against
the
wild
trees
on
the
hill
his
cottage
sheltered
under
i
see
the
toss
of
his
gray
locks
like
lear
for
he
had
felt
the
sting
of
all
too
greatly
giving
the
kingdom
of
his
mind
to
those
who
for
it
held
him
mad
o
england
guard
thy
living
like
him
from
a
like
fate
for
not
the
mighty
thunder
of
thy
proud
name
from
all
the
rocks
of
all
the
world
can
compensate
a
nation
whom
no
song
makes
glad
and
whom
no
seer
makes
great
the
end
