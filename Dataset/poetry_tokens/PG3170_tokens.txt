one
i
have
looked
at
this
claim
by
the
light
of
history
and
my
own
conscience
and
it
seems
to
me
so
looked
at
to
be
a
most
just
claim
and
that
resistance
to
it
means
nothing
short
of
a
denial
of
the
hope
of
civilisation
this
then
is
the
claim
is
right
and
necessary
that
all
men
should
have
work
to
do
which
shall
be
worth
be
of
itself
pleasant
to
which
should
be
done
under
such
conditions
as
would
make
it
neither
nor
turn
that
claim
about
as
i
may
think
of
it
as
long
as
i
can
i
can
not
find
that
it
is
an
exorbitant
claim
yet
again
i
say
if
society
would
or
could
admit
it
the
face
of
the
world
would
be
changed
discontent
and
strife
and
dishonesty
would
be
ended
to
feel
that
we
were
doing
work
useful
to
others
and
pleasant
to
ourselves
and
that
such
work
and
its
due
reward
not
fail
us
what
serious
harm
could
happen
to
us
then
and
the
price
to
be
paid
for
so
making
the
world
happy
is
revolution
the
day
is
coming
come
hither
lads
and
hearken
for
a
tale
there
is
to
tell
of
the
wonderful
days
when
all
shall
be
better
than
well
and
the
tale
shall
be
told
of
a
country
a
land
in
the
midst
of
the
sea
and
folk
shall
call
it
england
in
the
days
that
are
going
to
be
there
more
than
one
in
a
thousand
in
the
days
that
are
yet
to
come
shall
have
some
hope
of
the
morrow
some
joy
of
the
ancient
home
for
not
but
listen
to
this
strange
tale
of
all
folk
that
are
in
england
shall
be
better
lodged
than
swine
then
a
man
shall
work
and
bethink
him
and
rejoice
in
the
deeds
of
his
hand
nor
yet
come
home
in
the
even
too
faint
and
weary
to
stand
men
in
that
time
shall
work
and
have
no
fear
for
lack
of
earning
and
the
anear
i
tell
you
this
for
a
wonder
that
no
man
then
shall
be
glad
of
his
fall
and
mishap
to
snatch
at
the
work
he
had
for
that
which
the
worker
winneth
shall
then
be
his
indeed
nor
shall
half
be
reaped
for
nothing
by
him
that
sowed
no
seed
o
strange
new
wonderful
justice
but
for
whom
shall
we
gather
the
gain
for
ourselves
and
for
each
of
our
fellows
and
no
hand
shall
labour
in
vain
then
all
and
all
shall
be
and
no
more
shall
any
man
crave
for
riches
that
serve
for
nothing
but
to
fetter
a
friend
for
a
slave
and
what
wealth
then
shall
be
left
us
when
none
shall
gather
gold
to
buy
his
friend
in
the
market
and
pinch
and
pine
the
sold
nay
what
save
the
lovely
city
and
the
little
house
on
the
hill
and
the
wastes
and
the
woodland
beauty
and
the
happy
fields
we
till
and
the
homes
of
ancient
stories
the
tombs
of
the
mighty
dead
and
the
wise
men
seeking
out
marvels
and
the
teeming
head
and
the
hand
of
wonder
and
the
marvellous
and
the
banded
choirs
of
music
those
that
do
and
know
for
all
these
shall
be
ours
and
all
nor
shall
any
lack
a
share
of
the
toil
and
the
gain
of
living
in
the
days
when
the
world
grows
fair
ah
such
are
the
days
that
shall
be
but
what
are
the
deeds
of
in
the
days
of
the
years
we
dwell
in
that
wear
our
lives
away
why
then
and
for
what
are
we
waiting
there
are
three
words
to
speak
we
will
it
and
what
is
the
foeman
but
the
wakened
and
weak
o
why
and
for
what
are
we
waiting
while
our
brothers
droop
and
die
and
on
every
wind
of
the
heavens
a
wasted
life
goes
by
how
long
shall
they
reproach
us
where
crowd
on
crowd
they
dwell
poor
ghosts
of
the
wicked
city
the
hungry
hell
through
squalid
life
they
laboured
in
sordid
grief
they
died
those
sons
of
a
mighty
mother
those
props
of
pride
they
are
gone
there
is
none
can
undo
it
nor
save
our
souls
from
the
curse
but
many
a
million
cometh
and
shall
they
be
better
or
worse
it
is
we
must
answer
and
hasten
and
open
wide
the
door
for
the
rich
hurrying
terror
and
the
hope
of
the
poor
yea
the
voiceless
wrath
of
the
wretched
and
their
unlearned
discontent
we
must
give
it
voice
and
wisdom
till
the
be
spent
come
then
since
all
things
call
us
the
living
and
the
dead
and
the
weltering
tangle
a
glimmering
light
is
shed
come
then
let
us
cast
off
fooling
and
put
by
ease
and
rest
for
the
cause
alone
is
worthy
till
the
good
days
bring
the
best
come
join
in
the
only
battle
wherein
no
man
can
fail
where
whoso
fadeth
and
dieth
yet
his
deed
shall
still
prevail
ah
come
cast
off
all
fooling
for
this
at
least
we
know
that
the
dawn
and
the
day
is
coming
and
forth
the
banners
go
the
voice
of
toil
i
heard
men
saying
leave
hope
and
praying
all
days
shall
be
as
all
have
been
and
bring
fear
and
sorrow
the
toil
between
when
earth
was
younger
mid
toil
and
hunger
in
hope
we
strove
and
our
hands
were
strong
then
great
men
led
us
with
words
they
fed
us
and
bade
us
right
the
earthly
wrong
go
read
in
story
their
deeds
and
glory
their
names
amidst
the
nameless
dead
turn
then
from
lying
to
us
in
that
good
world
to
which
they
led
where
fast
and
faster
our
iron
master
the
thing
we
made
for
ever
drives
bids
us
grind
treasure
and
fashion
pleasure
for
other
hopes
and
other
lives
where
home
is
a
hovel
and
dull
we
grovel
forgetting
that
the
world
is
fair
where
no
babe
we
cherish
lest
its
very
soul
perish
where
our
mirth
is
crime
our
love
a
snare
who
now
shall
lead
us
what
god
shall
heed
us
as
we
lie
in
the
hell
our
hands
have
won
for
us
are
no
rulers
but
fools
and
befoolers
the
great
are
fallen
the
wise
men
gone
i
heard
men
saying
leave
tears
and
praying
the
sharp
knife
heedeth
not
the
sheep
are
we
not
stronger
than
the
rich
and
the
wronger
when
day
breaks
over
dreams
and
sleep
come
shoulder
to
shoulder
ere
the
world
grows
older
help
lies
in
nought
but
thee
and
me
hope
is
before
us
the
long
years
that
bore
us
bore
leaders
more
than
men
may
be
let
dead
hearts
tarry
and
trade
and
marry
and
trembling
nurse
their
dreams
of
mirth
while
we
the
living
our
lives
are
giving
to
bring
the
bright
new
world
to
birth
come
shoulder
to
shoulder
ere
earth
grows
older
the
cause
spreads
over
land
and
sea
now
the
world
shaketh
and
fear
awaketh
and
joy
at
last
for
thee
and
me
all
for
the
cause
hear
a
word
a
word
in
season
for
the
day
is
drawing
nigh
when
the
cause
shall
call
upon
us
some
to
live
and
some
to
die
he
that
dies
shall
not
die
lonely
many
an
one
hath
gone
before
he
that
lives
shall
bear
no
burden
heavier
than
the
life
they
bore
nothing
ancient
is
their
story
but
yesterday
they
bled
youngest
they
of
belovëd
last
of
all
the
valiant
dead
the
tidings
we
are
telling
was
the
tale
they
had
to
tell
the
hope
that
our
hearts
cherish
was
the
hope
for
which
they
fell
in
the
grave
where
tyrants
thrust
them
lies
their
labour
and
their
pain
but
undying
from
their
sorrow
springeth
up
the
hope
again
mourn
not
therefore
nor
lament
it
that
the
world
outlives
their
life
voice
and
vision
yet
they
give
us
making
strong
our
hands
for
strife
some
had
name
and
fame
and
honour
they
were
and
wise
and
strong
some
were
nameless
poor
unlettered
weak
in
all
but
grief
and
wrong
named
and
nameless
all
live
in
us
one
and
all
they
lead
us
yet
every
pain
to
count
for
nothing
every
sorrow
to
forget
hearken
how
they
cry
happy
happy
ye
that
ye
were
born
in
the
sad
slow
departing
in
the
rising
of
the
morn
the
crown
the
cause
hath
for
you
well
to
die
or
well
to
live
through
the
battle
through
the
tangle
peace
to
gain
or
peace
to
ah
it
may
be
oft
meseemeth
in
the
days
that
yet
shall
be
when
no
slave
of
gold
abideth
the
breadth
of
sea
to
sea
oft
when
men
and
maids
are
merry
ere
the
sunlight
leaves
the
earth
and
they
bless
the
day
belovëd
all
too
short
for
all
their
mirth
some
shall
pause
awhile
and
ponder
on
the
bitter
days
of
old
ere
the
toil
of
strife
and
battle
overthrew
the
curse
of
gold
then
lips
of
loved
and
lover
solemn
thoughts
of
us
shall
rise
we
who
once
were
fools
and
dreamers
then
shall
be
the
brave
and
wise
there
amidst
the
world
shall
our
earthly
deeds
abide
though
our
names
be
all
forgotten
and
the
tale
of
how
we
died
life
or
death
then
who
shall
heed
it
what
we
gain
or
what
we
lose
fair
flies
life
amid
the
struggle
and
the
cause
for
each
shall
choose
hear
a
word
a
word
in
season
for
the
day
is
drawing
nigh
when
the
cause
shall
call
upon
us
some
to
live
and
some
to
die
no
master
air
hardy
saith
man
to
man
heard
and
known
that
we
no
master
need
to
live
upon
this
earth
our
own
in
fair
and
manly
deed
the
grief
of
slaves
long
passed
away
for
us
hath
forged
the
chain
till
now
each
patient
day
builds
up
the
house
of
pain
and
we
shall
we
too
crouch
and
quail
ashamed
afraid
of
strife
and
lest
our
lives
untimely
fail
embrace
the
death
in
life
nay
cry
aloud
and
have
no
fear
we
few
against
the
world
awake

the
hope
we
bear
against
the
curse

hurled

grows
and

same
the
feeble
band
the
few
or
what
are
these
with
eyes
aflame
and
hands
to
deal
and
do
this
is
the
host
that
bears
the
word

a
lightning

a
shearing
sword

storm

overthrow
the
march

the
workers

sound
and
rumour

is
this
that
all
men
hear
like
the
wind
in
hollow
valleys
when
the
storm
is
drawing
near
like
the
rolling
on
of
ocean
in
the
eventide
of
fear

people
marching
on
whither
go

whence
come

workers

the
blended
sound
of
battle
and
drawing
near

the
hope

every
creature

the
banner
that
we
bear
and
the
world
is

lo
thereunder
riseth
wrath
and
hope

wonder
and
the
host
comes
marching
on
the
message
of
the
march
wind
fair
now
is
the
springtide
now
earth
lies
beholding
with
the
eyes
of
a
lover
the
face
of
the
sun
long
lasteth
the
daylight
and
hope
is
enfolding
the
acres
with
increase
begun
now
sweet
sweet
it
is
through
the
land
to
be
straying
the
birds
and
the
blossoms
and
the
beasts
of
the
field
love
mingles
with
love
and
no
evil
is
weighing
on
thy
heart
or
mine
where
all
sorrow
is
healed
from
township
to
township
down
and
by
tillage
far
far
have
we
wandered
and
long
was
the
day
but
now
cometh
eve
at
the
end
of
the
village
where
over
the
grey
wall
the
church
riseth
grey
there
is
wind
in
the
twilight
in
the
white
road
before
us
the
straw
from
the
is
blowing
about
the
rim
is
rising
a
star
glitters
us
and
the
vane
on
the
is
swinging
in
doubt
down
there
dips
the
highway
toward
the
bridge
crossing
over
the
brook
that
runs
on
to
the
thames
and
the
sea
draw
closer
my
sweet
we
are
lover
and
lover
this
eve
art
thou
given
to
gladness
and
me
shall
we
be
glad
always
come
closer
and
hearken
three
fields
further
on
as
they
told
me
down
there
when
the
young
moon
has
set
if
the
march
sky
should
darken
we
might
see
from
the
the
great
glare
hark
the
wind
in
the
from
london
it
bloweth
and
telleth
of
gold
and
of
hope
and
unrest
of
power
that
helps
not
of
wisdom
that
knoweth
but
teacheth
not
aught
of
the
worst
and
the
best
of
the
rich
men
it
telleth
and
strange
is
the
story
how
they
have
and
they
hanker
and
grip
far
and
wide
and
they
live
and
they
die
and
the
earth
and
its
glory
has
been
but
a
burden
they
scarce
might
abide
hark
the
march
wind
again
of
a
people
is
telling
of
the
life
that
they
live
there
so
haggard
and
grim
that
if
we
and
our
love
amidst
them
had
been
dwelling
my
fondness
had
faltered
thy
beauty
grown
dim
this
land
we
have
loved
in
our
love
and
our
leisure
for
them
hangs
in
heaven
high
out
of
their
reach
the
wide
hills
the
for
them
have
no
pleasure
the
grey
homes
of
their
fathers
no
story
to
teach
the
singers
have
sung
and
the
builders
have
builded
the
painters
have
fashioned
their
tales
of
delight
for
what
and
for
whom
hath
the
book
been
gilded
when
all
is
for
these
but
the
blackness
of
night
how
long
and
for
what
is
their
patience
abiding
how
oft
and
how
oft
shall
their
story
be
told
while
the
hope
that
none
seeketh
in
darkness
is
hiding
and
in
grief
and
in
sorrow
the
world
groweth
old
come
back
to
the
inn
love
and
the
lights
and
the
fire
and
the
old
tune
and
the
shuffling
of
feet
for
there
in
a
while
shall
be
rest
and
desire
and
there
shall
the
uprising
be
sweet
yet
love
as
we
wend
the
wind
bloweth
behind
us
and
beareth
the
last
tale
it
telleth
how
here
in
the
the
message
shall
find
us
for
the
hope
that
none
seeketh
is
coming
to
light
like
the
seed
of
midwinter
unheeded
unperished
like
the
wheat
the
snow
lying
green
like
the
love
that
us
unawares
and
uncherished
like
the
babe
thy
girdle
that
groweth
unseen
so
the
hope
of
the
people
now
buddeth
and
rest
fadeth
before
it
and
blindness
and
fear
it
biddeth
us
learn
all
the
wisdom
it
knoweth
it
hath
found
us
and
held
us
and
biddeth
us
hear
for
it
beareth
the
message
up
on
the
morrow
and
go
on
your
ways
toward
the
doubt
and
the
strife
join
hope
to
our
hope
and
blend
sorrow
with
sorrow
and
seek
for
love
in
the
short
days
of

the
old
inn
and
the
lights
and
the
fire
and
the
old
tune
and
the
shuffling
of

for
us
shall
be
quiet
and

and
uprising
to
deeds

be
