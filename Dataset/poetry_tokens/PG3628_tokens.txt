the

the

love
in
the
dawn
of
the
day
when
the
sea
and
the
earth
reflected
the
sunrise
above
i
set
forth
with
a
heart
full
of
courage
and
mirth
to
seek
for
the
kingdom
of
love
i
asked
of
a
poet
i
met
on
the
way
which
would
lead
me
aright
and
he
said
follow
me
and
ere
long
you
shall
see
its
glittering
turrets
of
light
and
soon
in
the
distance
a
city
shone
fair
look
yonder
he
said
how
it
gleams
but
alas
for
the
hopes
that
were
doomed
to
despair
it
was
only
the
kingdom
of
dreams
then
the
next
man
i
asked
was
a
gay
cavalier
and
he
said
follow
me
follow
me
and
with
laughter
and
song
we
went
speeding
along
by
the
shores
of
life
beautiful
sea
then
we
came
to
a
valley
more
tropical
far
than
the
wonderful
vale
of
cashmere
and
i
saw
from
a
bower
a
face
like
a
flower
smile
out
on
the
gay
cavalier
and
he
said
we
have
come
to
humanity
goal
here
love
and
delight
are
intense
but
alas
and
alas
for
the
hopes
of
my
soul
it
was
only
the
kingdom
of
sense
as
i
journeyed
more
slowly
i
met
on
the
road
a
coach
with
retainers
behind
and
they
said
follow
me
for
our
lady
abode
belongs
in
that
realm
you
will
find
was
a
grand
dame
of
fashion
a
bride
i
followed
encouraged
and
bold
but
my
hopes
died
away
like
the
last
gleams
of
day
for
we
came
to
the
kingdom
of
gold
at
the
door
of
a
cottage
i
asked
a
fair
maid
i
have
heard
of
that
realm
she
replied
but
my
feet
never
roam
from
the
of
home
so
i
know
not
the
way
and
she
sighed
i
looked
on
the
cottage
how
restful
it
seemed
and
the
maid
was
as
fair
as
a
dove
great
light
glorified
my
soul
as
i
cried
why
is
the
of
love
meg
curse
the
sun
rode
high
in
a
cloudless
sky
of
a
perfect
summer
morn
she
stood
and
gazed
out
into
the
street
and
wondered
why
she
was
born
on
the
topmost
branch
of
a
that
close
by
the
window
grew
a
robin
called
to
his
mate
enthralled
i
love
but
you
but
you
but
you
a
soft
look
came
in
her
hardened
face
she
had
not
wept
for
years
but
the
robin
trill
as
some
sounds
will
jarred
open
the
door
of
tears
she
thought
of
the
old
home
far
away
she
heard
the
of
the
mill
she
heard
the
turtle
wild
sweet
call
and
the
wail
of
the
she
saw
again
that
dusty
road
whence
he
came
riding
down
she
smelled
once
more
the
flower
she
wore
in
the
breast
of
her
simple
gown
out
on
the
meadow
she
heard
two
quarrel
and
fret
and
the
warning
cry
of
a
phoebe
bird
more
wet
more
wet
more
wet
with
a
blithe
hello
to
the
men
below
who
were
spreading
the
hay
the
rider
drew
rein
at
her
how
it
all
came
back
how
young
she
was
and
how
fair
she
was
what
innocence
crowned
her
brow
the
future
seemed
fair
for
love
was
there
and
now
and
now
and
now
in
a
dingy
glass
on
the
wall
near
by
she
gazed
on
her
faded
face
well
meg
i
declare
what
a
beauty
you
are
she
sneered
what
an
angel
of
grace
ha
ha
ha
ha
ha
ha
ha
ha
what
a
thing
of
beauty
and
grace
she
reached
out
her
arms
with
a
moaning
sob
oh
if
i
could
go
back
then
swift
and
strange
came
a
sudden
change
her
brow
grew
hard
and
black
a
curse
on
the
day
and
a
curse
on
that
man
and
on
all
who
are
his
she
cried
may
he
starve
and
be
cold
may
he
live
to
be
old
when
all
who
loved
him
have
died
her
wild
voice
frightened
the
robin
away
from
the
branch
by
the
and
little
he
knew
as
away
he
flew
of
the
memories
stirred
by
his
trill
he
called
to
his
mate
on
the
grass
below
follow
me
as
he
soared
on
high
and
as
mates
have
done
since
the
world
begun
she
followed
and
asked
not
why
the
dingy
room
seemed
curtained
with
gloom
meg
shivered
with
nameless
dread
the
ghost
of
her
youth
and
her
murdered
truth
seemed
risen
up
from
the
dead
she
hurried
out
into
the
noisy
street
for
the
silence
made
her
afraid
to
flee
from
thought
was
all
she
sought
she
cared
not
whither
she
strayed
still
on
she
pressed
in
her
wild
unrest
up
avenues
skirting
the
park
where
fashion
throng
moved
gayly
along
in
vanity
fair
when
hark
a
clatter
of
hoofs
down
the
stony
street
the
snort
of
a
frightened
horse
that
was
running
wild
and
a
laughing
child
at
play
in
its
very
course
with
one
swift
glance
meg
saw
it
all
child
my
god
child
she
cried
aloud
as
she
rushed
through
the
crowd
like
one
grown
suddenly
wild
there
almost
under
the
iron
feet
hemmed
in
by
a
passing
cart
stood
the
baby
boy
the
pride
and
joy
of
the
man
who
had
broken
her
heart
past
swooning
women
and
shouting
men
she
fled
like
a
flash
of
light
with
her
slender
arm
she
gathered
from
harm
the
form
of
the
laughing
sprite
the
feet
of
the
mad
horse
beat
her
down
on
the
pavings
grey
but
the
baby
laughed
out
with
a
merry
shout
and
thought
it
splendid
play
he
pulled
her
gown
and
called
to
her
say
dit
up
and
do
dat
some
more
das
jus
ze
way
my
papa
play
wiz
me
on
ze
nursery
floor
when
the
frightened
father
reached
the
scene
his
boy
looked
up
and
smiled
from
the
stiffening
fold
of
the
arm
of
meg
who
had
died
for
his
child
oh
idle
words
are
a
woman
curse
who
loves
as
woman
can
for
put
to
the
test
she
will
bare
her
breast
and
die
for
the
sake
of
the
man
solitude
laugh
and
the
world
laughs
with
you
weep
and
you
weep
alone
for
the
sad
old
earth
must
borrow
its
mirth
it
has
trouble
enough
of
its
own
sing
and
the
hills
will
answer
sigh
it
is
lost
on
the
air
the
echoes
bound
to
a
joyful
sound
but
shrink
from
voicing
care
rejoice
and
men
will
seek
you
grieve
and
they
turn
and
go
they
want
full
measure
of
all
your
pleasure
but
they
do
not
want
your
woe
be
glad
and
your
friends
are
many
be
sad
and
you
lose
them
all
there
are
none
to
decline
your
nectared
wine
but
alone
you
must
drink
life
gall
feast
and
your
halls
are
crowded
fast
and
the
world
goes
by
succeed
and
give
and
it
helps
you
live
but
it
can
not
help
you
die
there
is
room
in
the
halls
of
pleasure
for
a
long
and
lordly
train
but
one
by
one
we
must
all
file
on
through
the
narrow
aisles
of
pain
the
gossips
a
rose
in
my
garden
the
sweetest
and
fairest
was
hanging
her
head
through
the
long
golden
hours
and
early
one
morning
i
saw
her
tears
falling
and
heard
a
low
gossiping
talk
in
the
bowers
the
yellow
nasturtium
a
spinster
all
faded
was
telling
a
lily
what
ailed
the
poor
rose
that
wild
roving
bee
who
was
hanging
about
her
has
jilted
her
squarely
as
every
one
knows
i
knew
when
he
came
with
his
singing
and
sighing
his
airs
and
his
speeches
so
fine
and
so
sweet
just
how
it
would
end
but
no
one
would
believe
me
for
all
were
quite
ready
to
fall
at
his
feet
indeed
you
are
wrong
said
the
proudly
i
cared
nothing
for
him
he
called
on
me
once
and
would
have
come
often
no
doubt
if
i
asked
him
but
though
he
was
handsome
i
thought
him
a
dunce
now
now
that
not
true
cried
the
tall
oleander
he
has
travelled
and
seen
every
flower
that
grows
and
one
who
has
supped
in
the
garden
of
princes
we
all
might
have
known
would
not
we
with
the
rose
but
was
she
proud
when
he
showed
her
attention
and
she
let
him
caress
her
said
sly
mignonette
and
i
used
to
see
it
and
blush
for
her
folly
the
silly
thing
thinks
he
will
come
to
her
yet
i
thought
he
was
splendid
said
pretty
pert
larkspur
so
dark
and
so
grand
with
that
gay
cloak
of
gold
but
he
tried
once
to
kiss
me
the
impudent
fellow
and
i
got
offended
i
thought
him
too
bold
oh
fie
laughed
the
almond
that
does
for
a
story
though
i
hang
down
my
head
yet
i
see
all
that
goes
and
i
saw
you
reach
out
trying
hard
to
detain
him
but
he
just
tapped
your
cheek
and
flew
by
to
the
rose
he
cared
nothing
for
her
he
only
was
flirting
to
while
away
time
as
i
very
well
knew
so
i
turned
a
cold
shoulder
on
all
his
advances
because
i
was
certain
his
heart
was
untrue
the
rose
is
served
right
for
her
folly
in
trusting
an
stranger
quoth
proud
columbine
i
knew
what
he
was
and
thought
once
i
would
warn
her
but
of
course
the
affair
was
no
business
of
mine
oh
well
cried
the
peony
shrugging
her
shoulders
i
saw
all
along
that
the
bee
was
a
flirt
but
the
rose
has
been
always
so
praised
and
so
petted
i
thought
a
good
lesson
would
do
her
no
hurt
just
then
came
the
sound
of
a
sung
sweetly
i
saw
my
proud
rose
lifting
up
her
bowed
head
and
the
talk
of
the
gossips
was
hushed
in
a
moment
and
the
flowers
all
listened
to
hear
what
was
said
and
the
dark
handsome
bee
with
his
cloak
his
shoulder
came
swift
through
the
sunlight
and
kissed
the
sad
rose
and
whispered
my
darling
i
roved
the
world
over
and
you
are
the
loveliest
flower
that
grows
platonic
i
knew
it
the
first
of
the
summer
i
knew
it
the
same
at
the
end
that
you
and
your
love
were
plighted
but
could
you
be
my
friend
could
we
sit
in
the
twilight
could
we
walk
on
the
shore
with
only
a
pleasant
friendship
to
bind
us
and
nothing
more
there
was
not
a
word
of
folly
spoken
between
us
two
though
we
lingered
oft
in
the
garden
till
the
roses
were
wet
with
dew
we
touched
on
a
thousand
subjects
the
moon
and
the
worlds
above
and
our
talk
was
tinctured
with
science
and
everything
else
save
love
a
wholly
platonic
friendship
you
said
i
had
proven
to
you
could
bind
a
man
and
a
woman
the
whole
long
season
through
with
never
a
thought
of
flirting
though
both
were
in
their
youth
what
would
you
have
said
my
lady
if
you
had
known
the
truth
what
would
you
have
done
i
wonder
had
i
gone
on
my
knees
to
you
and
told
you
my
passionate
story
there
in
the
dusk
and
the
dew
my
burning
burdensome
story
hidden
and
hushed
so
long
my
story
of
hopeless
loving
say
would
you
have
thought
it
wrong
but
i
fought
with
my
heart
and
conquered
i
hid
my
wound
from
sight
you
were
going
away
in
the
morning
and
i
said
a
calm
but
now
when
i
sit
in
the
twilight
or
when
i
walk
by
the
sea
that
friendship
quite
platonic
comes
surging
over
me
and
a
passionate
longing
fills
me
for
the
roses
the
dusk
the
dew
for
the
beautiful
summer
vanished
for
the
moonlight
walks
and
grandpa
christmas
in
his
great
cushioned
chair
by
the
fender
an
old
man
sits
dreaming
his
withered
hands
licked
by
the
tender
warm
rays
of
the
red
anthracite
are
folded
before
him
all
listless
his
dim
eyes
are
fixed
on
the
blaze
while
over
him
sweeps
the
resistless
of
old
days
he
hears
not
the
mirth
in
the
hallway
he
hears
not
the
sounds
of
good
cheer
that
through
the
old
homestead
ring
alway
in
the
glad
of
the
year
he
heeds
not
the
chime
of
sweet
voices
as
the
last
gifts
are
hung
on
the
tree
in
a
day
he
rejoices
in
his
lost
he
has
gone
back
across
dead
decembers
to
his
childhood
fair
land
of
delight
and
his
mother
sweet
smile
he
remembers
as
he
hangs
up
his
stocking
at
night
he
remembers
the
slumber
all
broken
and
restless
because
of
the
visions
that
came
without
number
of
dear
santa
claus
again
in
his
manhood
beginning
he
sees
himself
thrown
on
the
world
and
into
the
vortex
of
sinning
by
pleasure
strong
arms
he
is
hurled
he
hears
the
sweet
christmas
bells
ringing
repent
ye
repent
ye
and
pray
but
he
joins
with
his
comrades
in
singing
a
bacchanal
lay
again
he
stands
under
the
holly
with
a
blushing
face
lifted
to
his
for
love
has
been
stronger
than
folly
and
has
turned
him
from
vice
unto
bliss
and
the
whole
world
is
lit
with
new
glory
as
the
sweet
vows
are
uttered
again
while
the
christmas
bells
tell
the
old
story
of
peace
unto
men
again
with
his
little
brood
him
he
sits
by
the
fair
he
knows
that
the
angels
have
crowned
him
with
the
truest
best
riches
of
life
and
the
hearts
of
the
children
untroubled
are
filled
with
the
gay
and
the
gifts
for
sweet
maudie
are
doubled
tis
her
birthday
beside
again
ah
dear
jesus
have
pity
he
finds
in
the
chill
waning
day
that
one
has
come
home
from
the
city
frail
maudie
whom
love
led
astray
she
lies
with
her
babe
on
her
bosom
by
the
snow
fleecy
spread
a
bud
and
a
poor
trampled
blossom
and
both
are
quite
dead
so
fair
and
so
fragile
just
twenty
how
mocking
the
bells
sound
she
starved
in
this
great
land
of
plenty
when
she
tried
to
grope
back
to
the
light
christ
are
thy
disciples
inhuman
or
only
for
hast
thou
died
no
mercy
is
shown
to
a
woman
who
once
steps
aside
again
he
leans
over
the
shrouded
still
form
of
the
mother
and
wife
very
lonely
the
way
seems
and
clouded
as
he
looks
down
the
vista
of
life
with
the
sweet
christmas
chimes
there
is
blended
the
knell
for
a
life
that
is
done
and
he
knows
that
his
joys
are
all
ended
and
his
waiting
begun
so
long
have
the
years
been
so
lonely
as
he
counts
them
by
christmases
gone
i
am
homesick
he
murmurs
if
only
the
angel
would
lead
the
way
on
i
am
cold
in
this
chill
winter
weather
why
maudie
dear
where
have
you
been
and
you
too
sweet
wife
and
together
o
christ
let
me
in
the
children
ran
in
from
the
hallway
were
you
calling
us
grandpa
they
said
then
shrank
with
that
fear
that
comes
alway
when
young
eyes
look
their
first
on
the
dead
the
freedom
so
longed
for
is
given
the
children
speak
low
and
draw
near
dear
grandpa
keeps
christmas
in
heaven
with
grandma
this
year
after
the
engagement
well
mabel
is
over
and
ended
the
ball
i
wrote
was
to
be
and
oh
it
was
perfectly
splendid
if
you
have
been
here
to
see
i
a
thousand
things
to
write
you
that
i
know
you
are
wanting
to
hear
and
one
that
is
sure
to
delight
you
i
am
wearing
joe
diamond
my
dear
yes
mamma
is
quite
ecstatic
that
i
am
engaged
to
joe
she
thinks
i
am
rather
erratic
and
feared
that
i
might
say
no
but
mabel
i
though
nobody
it
dear
and
a
fortune
like
joe
is
given
to
lay
at
one
feet
each
year
you
know
my
old
fancy
for
harry
or
at
least
i
am
certain
you
guessed
that
it
took
all
my
sense
not
to
marry
and
go
with
that
fellow
out
west
but
that
was
my
very
first
season
and
harry
was
poor
as
could
be
and
mamma
good
practical
reason
took
all
the
romance
out
of
me
she
whisked
me
off
over
the
ocean
and
had
me
presented
at
court
and
got
me
all
out
of
the
notion
that
ranch
life
out
west
was
my
forte
of
course
i
have
never
repented
i
not
such
a
goose
of
a
thing
but
after
i
had
consented
to
joe
and
he
gave
me
the
ring
i
felt
such
a
queer
sensation
i
seemed
to
go
into
a
trance
away
from
the
music
pulsation
away
from
the
lights
and
the
dance
and
the
wind
the
wild
prairie
seemed
blowing
strong
and
free
and
it
seemed
not
joe
but
harry
who
was
standing
there
close
to
me
and
the
funniest
feverish
feeling
went
up
from
my
feet
to
my
head
with
little
chills
after
it
stealing
and
my
hands
got
as
numb
as
the
dead
a
moment
and
then
it
was
over
the
diamond
blazed
up
in
my
eyes
and
i
saw
in
the
face
of
my
lover
a
questioning
strange
surprise
maybe
was
the
scent
of
the
flowers
that
heavy
with
fragrance
bloomed
near
but
i
did
feel
natural
for
hours
it
was
odd
now
was
it
dear
write
soon
to
your
fortunate
clara
who
has
carried
the
prize
away
and
say
you
come
on
when
i
marry

think
it
will
happen
in
may
a
holiday
the
wife
the
house
is
like
a
garden
the
children
are
the
flowers
the
gardener
should
come
methinks
and
walk
among
his
bowers
oh
lock
the
door
on
worry
and
shut
your
cares
away
not
time
of
year
but
love
and
cheer
will
make
a
holiday

toil

late

does
not
mean
to
wound
me
i
know
his
heart
is
kind
alas
that
man
can
love
us
and
be
so
blind
so
blind
a
little
time
for
pleasure
a
little
time
for
play
a
word
to
prove
the
life
of
love
and
frighten
care
away
tho
poor
my
lot
in
some
small
cot
were
a
holiday
the
husband
she
has
not
meant
to
wound
me
nor
to
vex
zounds
but
is
difficult
to
please
the
sex
i
housed
and
gowned
her
like
a
very
queen
yet
there
she
goes
with
discontented
mien
i
gave
her
diamonds
only
yesterday
some
women
are
like
that
do
what
you
may
false
false
good
god
i
am
dreaming
no
no
it
never
can
be
you
who
are
so
true
in
seeming
you
false
to
your
vows
and
me
my
wife
and
my
fair
boy
mother
the
star
of
my
life
my
queen
to
yield
herself
to
another
like
some
light
magdalene
proofs
what
are
proofs
i
defy
them
they
never
can
shake
my
trust
if
you
look
in
my
face
and
deny
them
i
will
trample
them
into
the
dust
for
whenever
i
read
of
the
glory
of
the
realms
of
paradise
i
sought
for
the
truth
of
the
story
and
found
it
in
your
sweet
eyes
why
you
are
the
shy
young
creature
i
wooed
in
her
maiden
grace
there
was
purity
in
each
feature
and
my
heaven
i
found
in
your
face
and
not
only
married
but
mated
i
would
say
in
my
pride
and
joy
and
our
hopes
were
all
consummated
when
the
angels
gave
us
our
boy
now
you
could
not
blot
that
beginning
so
beautiful
pure
and
true
with
a
record
of
wicked
sinning
as
a
common
woman
might
do
look
up
in
your
old
frank
fashion
with
your
smile
so
free
from
art
and
say
that
no
guilty
passion
has
ever
crept
into
your
heart
how
pallid
you
are
and
you
tremble
you
are
hiding
your
face
from
view
tho
a
sinner
you
can
not
dissemble
my
god
then
the
tale
is
true
true
and
the
sun
above
us
shines
on
in
the
summer
skies
and
men
say
the
angels
love
us
and
that
god
is
good
and
wise
yet
he
lets
a
wanton
thing
like
you
ruin
my
home
and
my
name
get
out
of
my
sight
or
i
strike
you
dead
in
your
shameless
shame
no
no
i
was
wild
i
was
brutal
i
would
not
take
your
life
for
the
efforts
of
death
would
be
futile
to
wipe
out
the
sin
of
a
wife
wife
why
that
word
has
seemed
sainted
i
uttered
it
like
a
prayer
and
now
to
think
it
is
tainted
christ
how
much
we
can
bear
slay
you
my
boy
stained
mother
nay
that
would
not
punish
or
save
a
soul
that
has
outraged
another
finds
no
sudden
peace
in
the
grave
i
will
leave
you
here
to
the
eden
that
was
your
own
while
on
toward
my
life
december
i
walk
in
the
dark
alone
two
sinners
there
was
a
man
it
was
said
one
time
who
went
astray
in
his
youthful
prime
can
the
brain
keep
cool
and
the
heart
keep
quiet
when
the
blood
is
a
river
that
running
riot
and
boys
will
be
boys
the
old
folks
say
and
a
man
is
the
better
who
had
his
day
the
sinner
reformed
and
the
preacher
told
of
the
prodigal
son
who
came
back
to
the
fold
and
christian
people
threw
open
the
door
with
a
warmer
welcome
than
ever
before
wealth
and
honour
were
his
to
command
and
a
spotless
woman
gave
him
her
hand
and
the
world
strewed
their
pathway
with
blossoms
abloom
crying
god
bless
ladye
and
god
bless
groom
there
was
a
maiden
who
went
astray
in
the
golden
dawn
of
her
life
young
day
she
had
more
passion
and
heart
than
head
and
she
followed
blindly
where
fond
love
led
and
love
unchecked
is
a
dangerous
guide
to
wander
at
will
by
a
fair
girl
side
the
woman
repented
and
turned
from
sin
but
no
door
opened
to
let
her
in
the
preacher
prayed
that
she
might
be
forgiven
but
told
her
to
look
for
mercy
in
heaven
for
this
is
the
law
of
the
earth
we
know
that
the
woman
is
stoned
while
the
man
may
go
a
brave
man
wedded
her
after
all
but
the
world
said
frowning
we
shall
not
call
the
phantom
ball
you
remember
the
hall
on
the
corner
as
i
walked
down
street
i
heard
the
sound
of
music
and
the
rhythmic
beat
and
beat
in
time
to
the
pulsing
measure
of
lightly
tripping
feet
and
i
turned
and
entered
the
doorway
it
was
years
since
i
had
been
there
years
and
life
seemed
altered
pleasure
had
changed
to
care
but
again
i
was
hearing
the
music
and
watching
the
dancers
fair
and
then
as
i
stood
and
listened
the
music
lost
its
glee
and
instead
of
the
merry
waltzers
there
were
ghosts
of
the
ghosts
of
the
who
once
had
danced
with
me
oh
was
a
ghastly
picture
oh
was
a
gruesome
crowd
each
bearing
a
skull
on
his
shoulder
each
trailing
a
long
white
shroud
as
they
whirled
in
the
dance
together
and
the
music
shrieked
aloud
as
they
danced
their
dry
bones
rattled
like
shutters
in
a
blast
and
they
stared
from
eyeless
sockets
on
me
as
they
circled
past
and
the
music
that
kept
them
whirling
was
a
funeral
dirge
played
fast
some
of
them
wore
their
others
were
rotted
away
some
had
mould
on
their
garments
and
some
seemed
dead
but
a
day
corpses
all
but
i
knew
them
as
friends
once
blithe
and
gay
beauty
and
strength
and
manhood
and
this
was
the
end
of
it
all
nothing
but
phantoms
whirling
in
a
ghastly
skeleton
ball
but
the
music
ceased
and
they
vanished
and
i
came
away
from
the
hall
words
and
thoughts
he
said
as
he
sat
in
her
theatre
box
between
the
acts
what
beastly
weather
how
like
a
parrot
the
lover
talks
and
the
lady
is
tame
and
the
villain
stalks
i
hope
they
finally
die
together
he
thought
are
fair
as
the
dawn
first
know
the
angels
keep
guard
above
so
i
chatter
of
all
the
time
i
am
mad
to
love
he
said
the
season
is
almost
run
how
glad
we
are
when
the
whirl
is
over
for
the
toil
of
pleasure
is
more
than
its
fun
and
what
is
it
all
when
all
is
done
but
the
stick
of
a
rocket
that
has
descended
he
thought
be
off
with
this
scene
of
know
you
were
to
have
you
to
lose
myself
in
the
crimson
your
a
kiss
of
he
said
you
are
going
abroad
no
doubt
this
land
of
liberty
coldly
scorning
i
too
shall
journey
a
bit
about
from
wall
street
up
by
the
road
out
to
harlem
and
down
each
morning
he
thought
must
follow
on
land
or
the
cry
of
a
rapture
that
may
not
reach
your
heart
from
the
heart
of
stir
you
with
strange
wanted
a
little
girl
where
have
they
gone
to
the
little
girls
with
natural
manners
and
natural
curls
who
love
their
dollies
and
like
their
toys
and
talk
of
something
besides
the
boys
little
old
women
in
plenty
i
find
mature
in
manners
and
old
of
mind
little
old
flirts
who
talk
of
their
beaux
and
vie
with
each
other
in
stylish
clothes
little
old
belles
who
at
nine
and
ten
are
sick
of
pleasure
and
tired
of
men
weary
of
travel
of
balls
of
fun
and
find
no
new
thing
under
the
sun
once
in
the
beautiful
long
ago
some
dear
little
children
i
used
to
know
girls
who
were
merry
as
lambs
at
play
and
laughed
and
rollicked
the
livelong
day
they
thought
not
at
all
of
the
style
of
their
clothes
they
never
imagined
that
boys
were
beaux
other
girls
brothers
and
mates
were
they
splendid
fellows
to
help
them
play
where
have
they
gone
to
if
you
see
one
of
them
anywhere
send
her
to
me
i
would
give
a
medal
of
purest
gold
to
one
of
those
dear
little
girls
of
old
with
an
innocent
heart
and
an
open
smile
who
knows
not
the
meaning
of
flirt
or
style
the
suicide
vast
was
the
wealth
i
carried
in
life
pack
youth
health
ambition
hope
and
trust
but
time
and
fate
those
robbers
fit
for
any
crime
stole
all
and
left
me
but
the
empty
sack
before
me
lay
a
long
and
lonely
track
of
darkling
hills
and
barren
steeps
to
climb
behind
me
lay
in
shadows
the
sublime
lost
lands
of
love
delight
alack
alack
unwearied
and
with
springing
steps
elate
i
had
conveyed
my
wealth
along
the
road
the
empty
sack
proved
now
a
heavier
load
i
was
borne
down
beneath
its
worthless
weight
i
stumbled
on
and
knocked
at
death
dark
gate
there
was
no
answer
stung
by
sorrow
goad
i
my
way
into
that
grim
abode
and
laughed
and
flung
life
empty
sack
to
fate
unknown
and
uninvited
i
passed
in
to
that
strange
land
that
hangs
between
two
goals
round
which
a
dark
and
solemn
river
rolls
more
dread
its
silence
than
the
loud
earth
din
and
now
where
was
the
peace
i
hoped
to
win
ships
slid
past
me
in
great
shoals
their
bloody
decks
thronged
with
mistaken
souls
god
punishes
mistakes
sometimes
like
sin
not
rest
and
not
oblivion
i
found
my
suffering
self
dwelt
with
me
just
the
same
but
here
no
sleep
was
and
no
sweet
dreams
came
to
give
me
respite
tyrant
death
uncrowned
by
my
own
hand
still
king
of
terrors
frowned
upon
my
shuddering
soul
that
shrank
in
shame
before
those
eyes
where
sorrow
blent
with
blame
and
those
accusing
lips
that
made
no
sound
what
gruesome
shapes
dawned
on
my
startled
sight
what
awful
sighs
broke
on
my
listening
ear
the
anguish
of
the
earth
augmented
here
a
made
one
continuous
night
the
sack
i
flung
away
in
impious
spite
hung
yet
upon
me
filled
i
saw
in
fear
with
tears
that
rained
from
earth
adjacent
sphere
and
turned
to
stones
in
falling
from
that
height
and
close
about
me
pressed
a
grieving
throng
each
with
his
heavy
sack
which
bowed
him
so
his
face
was
hidden
one
of
these
mourned
know
who
enters
here
but
finds
the
way
more
long
to
those
fair
realms
where
sounds
the
angels
song
there
is
no
exit
out
of
woe
ye
can
not
dash
the
locked
door
down
and
go
to
claim
thy
rightful
joy
through
paths
of
wrong
he
passed
into
the
shadows
dim
and
grey
and
left
me
to
pursue
my
path
alone
with
terror
greater
than
i
yet
had
known
hard
on
my
soul
the
awful
knowledge
lay
death
had
not
ended
life
nor
found
god
way
but
with
my
same
sad
sorrows
still
my
own
where
led
to
i
had
but
wandered
off
and
gone
astray
with
earth
still
near
enough
to
hear
its
sighs
with
heaven
afar
and
hell
but
just
below
still
on
and
on
my
lonely
soul
must
go
until
i
earn
the
right
to
paradise
we
can
not
force
our
way
into
god
skies
nor
rush
into
the
rest
we
long
to
know
but
patiently
with
bleeding
steps
and
slow
toil
on
to
where
selfhood
in
godhood
dies
now
i
lay
me
when
i
pass
from
earth
away
palsied
though
i
be
and
grey
may
my
spirit
keep
so
young
that
my
failing
faltering
tongue
frames
that
prayer
so
dear
to
me
taught
me
at
my
mother
knee
i
lay
me
down
to
passing
to
eternal
rest
on
the
loving
parent
breast
pray
the
lord
my
soul
to
from
all
danger
safe
and
calm
in
the
hollow
of
his
palm
i
should
die
before
i
drifting
with
a
bated
breath
out
of
slumber
into
death
pray
the
lord
my
soul
to
from
the
body
claim
set
free
sheltered
in
the
great
to
be
simple
prayer
of
trust
and
truth
taught
me
in
my
early
youth
let
my
soul
its
beauty
keep
when
i
lay
me
down
to
sleep
the
messenger
she
rose
up
in
the
early
dawn
and
white
and
silently
she
moved
about
the
house
four
men
had
gone
to
battle
for
the
land
they
loved
and
she
the
mother
and
the
wife
waited
for
tidings
from
the
strife
how
still
the
house
seemed
and
her
tread
was
like
the
footsteps
of
the
dead
the
long
day
passed
the
dark
night
came
she
had
not
seen
a
human
face
some
voice
spoke
suddenly
her
name
how
loud
it
echoed
in
that
place
where
day
by
day
no
sound
was
heard
but
her
own
footsteps
bring
you
word
she
cried
to
whom
she
could
not
see
word
from
the
to
me
a
soldier
entered
at
the
door
and
stood
within
the
dim
firelight
i
bring
you
tidings
of
the
four
he
said
who
left
you
for
the
fight
god
bless
you
friend
she
cried
speak
on
for
i
can
bear
it
one
is
gone
ay
one
is
gone
he
said
which
one
dear
lady
he
your
eldest
son
a
deathly
pallor
shot
across
her
withered
face
she
did
not
weep
she
said
it
is
a
grievous
loss
but
god
gives
his
beloved
sleep
what
of
the
living
of
the
three
and
when
can
they
come
back
to
me
the
soldier
turned
away
his
head
lady
your
husband
too
is
dead
she
put
her
hand
upon
her
brow
a
wild
sharp
pain
was
in
her
eyes
my
husband
oh
god
help
me
now
the
soldier
heard
her
shuddering
sighs
the
task
was
harder
than
he
thought
your
youngest
son
dear
madam
fought
close
at
his
father
side
both
fell
dead
by
the
bursting
of
a
shell
she
moved
her
lips
and
seemed
to
moan
her
face
had
paled
to
ashen
grey
then
one
is
left
me
one
alone
she
said
of
four
who
marched
away
oh
overruling
god
how
can
i
pass
beneath
thy
rod
the
soldier
walked
across
the
floor
paused
at
the
window
at
the
door
wiped
the
cold
from
his
cheek
and
sought
the
mourner
side
again
once
more
dear
lady
i
must
speak
your
last
remaining
son
was
slain
just
at
the
closing
of
the
fight
twas
he
who
sent
me
here
god
knows
the
man
said
afterward
the
fight
itself
was
not
so
hard
a
servian
legend
long
long
ago
ere
yet
our
race
began
when
earth
was
empty
waiting
still
for
man
before
the
breath
of
life
to
him
was
given
the
angels
fell
into
a
strife
in
heaven
at
length
one
furious
demon
grasped
the
sun
and
sped
away
as
fast
as
he
could
run
and
with
a
ringing
laugh
of
fiendish
mirth
he
leaped
the
battlements
and
fell
to
earth
dark
was
it
then
in
heaven
but
light
below
for
there
the
demon
wandered
to
and
fro
tilting
aloft
upon
a
slender
pole
the
orb
of
day
the
pilfering
old
soul
the
angels
wept
and
wailed
but
through
the
dark
the
great
creator
voice
cried
sternly
hark
who
will
restore
to
me
the
orb
of
light
him
will
i
honour
in
all
heaven
sight
then
over
the
battlements
there
dropped
another
a
shrewder
angel
well
there
could
not
be
quoth
he
behold
my
love
for
thee
my
brother
for
i
have
left
all
heaven
to
stay
with
thee
thy
loneliness
and
wanderings
i
will
share
thy
heavy
burden
i
will
help
thee
bear
well
said
the
demon
answered
and
well
done
but
i
not
tax
you
with
this
heavy
sun
your
company
will
cheer
me
it
is
true
and
i
could
never
think
of
burdening
you
idly
they
wandered
onward
side
by
side
till
by
and
by
they
neared
a
silvery
tide
let
bathe
the
angel
suddenly
suggested
agreed
the
demon
answered
i
go
last
because
i
needs
must
leave
quite
unmolested
this
tiresome
sun
which
i
will
now
make
fast
he
set
the
pole
well
in
the
sandy
turf
and
called
a
jackdaw
near
to
watch
the
place
meanwhile
the
angel
paddled
in
the
surf
and
playfully
dared
his
brother
to
a
race
they
swam
around
together
for
a
while
the
demon
always
keeping
near
his
prize
till
presently
the
angel
with
a
smile
proposed
a
healthful
diving
exercise
the
demon
hesitated
but
thought
he
the
jackdaw
will
inform
me
with
a
cry
if
this
good
brother
tries
deceiving
me
i
will
not
be
outdone
by
him
not
i
down
down
they
went
the
angel
in
a
trice
rose
up
again
and
swift
to
shore
he
sped
the
jackdaw
shrieked
but
lo
a
mile
of
ice
the
demon
found
had
frozen
his
head
he
swore
an
oath
and
gathered
all
his
force
and
broke
the
ice
to
see
the
sun
of
course
held
firmly
in
the
radiant
angel
hand
who
sailed
away
toward
the
heavenly
land
he
gave
pursuit
wrath
lent
speed
to
his
chase
all
heaven
leaned
down
to
watch
the
exciting
race
on
on
they
came
and
still
the
evil
one
gained
on
the
angel
burdened
with
the
sun
with
bated
breath
and
faces
white
as
ghosts
over
the
walls
leaned
heaven
affrighted
hosts
up
up
still
up
the
angel
almost
spent
threw
one
foot
forward
the
battlement
the
demon
seized
the
other
with
a
shout
so
fierce
his
clutch
he
pulled
the
bottom
out
as
the
good
angel
fainting
laid
the
sun
down
by
the
throne
of
god
who
cried
well
done
thy
great
misfortune
shall
be
made
divine
will
i
create
with
a
foot
like
thine
the
cunningest
thing
that
a
baby
can
do
is
the
very
first
time
it
plays
when
it
hides
its
pink
little
face
in
its
hands
and
crows
and
shows
that
it
understands
what
nurse
and
mamma
and
papa
too
mean
when
they
hide
and
cry
peek
oh
what
a
wonderful
thing
it
is
when
they
find
that
baby
can
play
like
this
and
every
one
listens
and
thinks
it
true
that
baby
gurgle
means
and
over
and
over
the
changes
are
rung
on
the
marvellous
infant
who
talks
so
young
i
wonder
if
any
one
ever
knew
a
baby
that
never
played
is
old
as
the
hills
are
i
believe
cain
was
taught
it
by
mother
eve
for
cain
was
an
innocent
baby
too
and
i
am
sure
he
played
and
the
whole
world
full
of
the
children
of
men
have
all
of
them
played
that
game
since
then
kings
and
princes
and
beggars
too
every
one
has
played
thief
and
robber
and
ruffian
bold
the
crazy
tramp
and
the
drunkard
old
all
have
been
babies
who
laughed
and
knew
how
to
hide
and
play
the
falling
of
thrones
above
the
din
of
commerce
above
the
clamour
and
rattle
of
labour
disputing
with
riches
of
anarchists
threats
and
groans
above
the
hurry
and
hustle
and
roar
of
that
bloodless
battle
where
men
are
fighting
for
riches
i
hear
the
falling
of
thrones
i
see
no
savage
host
i
hear
no
martial
drumming
but
down
in
the
dust
at
our
feet
lie
the
useless
crowns
of
kings
and
the
mighty
spirit
of
progress
is
steadily
coming
coming
and
the
flag
of
one
republic
abroad
to
the
world
he
flings
the
universal
republic
where
worth
not
birth
is
royal
where
the
lowliest
born
may
climb
on
a
ladder
to
fame
where
the
highest
and
proudest
born
if
he
be
not
true
and
loyal
shall
find
no
masking
title
to
cover
and
gild
his
shame
not
with
the
bellow
of
guns
and
not
with
sabres
whetting
but
with
growing
minds
of
men
is
waged
this
swordless
fray
while
over
the
dim
horizon
the
sun
of
royalty
setting
lights
with
a
dying
splendour
the
humblest
toiler
way
her
last
letter
sitting
alone
by
the
window
watching
the
moonlit
street
bending
my
head
to
listen
to
the
sound
of
your
feet
i
have
been
wondering
darling
how
i
can
bear
the
pain
when
i
watch
with
sighs
and
eyes
and
wait
for
your
coming
in
vain
for
i
know
that
a
day
approaches
when
your
heart
will
tire
of
me
when
by
door
and
gate
i
may
watch
and
wait
for
a
form
i
shall
not
see
when
the
love
that
is
now
my
heaven
the
kisses
that
make
my
life
you
will
bestow
on
another
and
that
other
will
be
your
wife
you
will
grow
weary
of
sinning
though
you
do
not
call
it
so
you
will
long
for
a
love
that
is
purer
than
the
love
that
we
two
know
god
knows
i
have
loved
you
dearly
with
a
passion
strong
as
true
but
you
will
grow
tired
and
leave
me
though
i
gave
up
all
for
you
i
was
as
pure
as
the
morning
when
i
first
looked
on
your
face
i
knew
i
never
could
reach
you
in
your
high
exalted
place
but
i
looked
and
loved
and
worshipped
as
a
flower
might
worship
a
star
and
your
eyes
shone
down
upon
me
and
you
seemed
so
far
so
far
and
then
well
then
you
loved
me
loved
me
with
all
your
heart
but
we
could
not
stand
at
the
altar
we
were
so
far
apart
if
a
star
should
wed
with
a
flower
the
star
must
drop
from
the
sky
or
the
flower
in
trying
to
reach
it
would
droop
on
its
stalk
and
die
but
you
said
that
you
loved
me
darling
and
swore
by
the
heavens
above
that
the
lord
and
all
of
his
angels
would
sanction
and
bless
our
love
and
i
i
was
weak
not
wicked
my
love
was
as
pure
as
true
and
sin
itself
seemed
a
virtue
if
only
shared
by
you
we
have
been
happy
together
though
under
the
cloud
of
sin
but
i
know
that
the
day
approaches
when
my
chastening
must
begin
you
have
been
faithful
and
tender
but
you
will
not
always
be
but
i
think
i
had
better
leave
you
while
your
thoughts
are
kind
of
me
i
know
my
beauty
is
fading
sin
furrows
the
fairest
brow
and
i
know
that
your
heart
will
weary
of
the
face
you
smile
on
now
you
will
take
a
bride
to
your
bosom
after
you
turn
from
me
you
will
sit
with
your
wife
in
the
moonlight
and
bold
her
babe
on
your
knee
o
god
i
never
could
bear
it
it
would
madden
my
brain
i
know
and
so
while
you
love
me
dearly
i
think
i
had
better
go
it
is
sweeter
to
feel
my
darling
to
know
as
i
fall
asleep
that
some
one
will
mourn
me
and
miss
me
that
some
one
is
left
to
weep
than
to
die
as
i
should
in
the
future
to
drop
in
the
street
some
day
unknown
unwept
and
forgotten
after
you
cast
me
away
perhaps
the
blood
of
the
saviour
can
wash
my
garments
clean
perchance
i
may
drink
of
the
waters
that
flow
through
pastures
green
perchance
we
may
meet
in
heaven
and
walk
in
the
streets
above
with
nothing
to
grieve
us
or
part
us
since
our
sinning
was
all
through
love
god
says
love
one
another
and
down
to
the
depths
of
hell
will
he
send
the
soul
of
a
woman
because
she
loved
and
fell
and
so
in
the
moonlight
he
found
her
or
found
her
beautiful
clay
lifeless
and
pallid
as
marble
for
the
spirit
had
flown
away
the
farewell
words
she
had
written
she
held
to
her
cold
white
breast
and
the
buried
blade
of
a
dagger
told
how
she
had
gone
to
rest
the
princess
a
tale
of
nonsense
land
all
through
the
castle
of
ease
where
the
chief
employment
was
spread
consternation
and
wild
despair
the
queen
was
wringing
her
hands
and
hair
the
maids
of
honour
were
sad
and
solemn
the
pages
looked
blank
as
they
stood
in
column
the
blubbered
the
cook
in
the
kitchen
dropped
tears
in
the
stew
and
all
through
the
castle
went
sob
and
wail
for
the
princess
had
broken
her
the
beautiful
princess
of
the
lord
broken
her
down
to
the
quick
no
wonder
the
queen
and
her
court
were
sick
never
sorrow
so
dread
before
had
dared
to
enter
that
castle
door
oh
what
would
my
lord
say
when
she
took
off
her
glove
on
her
the
fairest
princess
in
nonsense
land
with
a
broken
on
her
hand
was
a
terrible
terrible
accident
and
they
called
a
meeting
of
parliament
and
never
before
that
royal
court
had
come
such
question
of
grave
import
as
how
could
you
hurry
a
nail
to
grow
and
the
skill
of
the
kingdom
was
called
to
show
they
sent
for
monsieur
he
smoothed
down
the
corners
so
ragged
and
rough
they
sent
for
madame
la
who
lived
on
the
fingers
of
they
sent
for
professor
de
who
took
her
powder
and
rubbed
it
in
they
sent
for
the
pudgy
nurse
to
bathe
her
finger
in
and
they
called
the
court
surgeon
monsieur
to
hear
what
he
thought
of
the
new
nail
shape
over
the
kingdom
the
telegrams
flew
which
told
how
the
thrived
and
grew
and
all
through
the
realm
of
nonsense
land
they
offered
up
prayers
for
the
princess
hand
at
length
the
glad
tidings
were
heard
with
a
shout
what
the
princess
had
grown
out
pointed
and
polished
and
pink
and
clean
befitting
the
hand
of
a
queen
salutes
were
fired
all
over
the
land
by
the
battery
band
and
great
was
the
joy
of
my
lord
who
straightway
ordered
his
wedding
clothes
and
paid
his
tailor
don
who
died
of
amazement
the
day
my
lord
by
a
jury
was
judged
insane
for
they
said
and
the
truth
of
the
saying
was
plain
that
a
lord
of
such
very
high
pedigree
would
never
be
paying
his
bills
you
see
unless
he
was
out
of
his
head
and
so
they
locked
him
up
without
more
ado
and
the
beautiful
princess
pined
for
her
lover
my
lord
till
she
entered
a
convent
and
took
the
veil
and
this
is
the
end
of
my
nonsense
tale
a
baby
in
the
house
i
knew
that
a
baby
was
hid
in
the
house
though
i
saw
no
cradle
and
heard
no
cry
but
the
husband
went
tiptoeing
round
like
a
mouse
and
the
good
wife
was
humming
a
soft
lullaby
and
there
was
a
look
on
the
face
of
that
mother
that
i
knew
could
mean
only
thing
and
no
other
the
i
said
to
myself
for
i
knew
that
the
woman
before
me
was
certainly
that
for
there
lay
in
the
corner
a
tiny
cloth
shoe
and
i
saw
on
the
stand
such
a
wee
little
hat
and
the
beard
of
the
husband
said
plain
as
could
be
two
fat
chubby
hands
have
been
tugging
at
me
and
he
took
from
his
pocket
a
gay
and
a
dog
that
would
bark
if
you
pulled
on
a
string
and
the
wife
laid
them
up
with
such
a
pleased
look
and
i
said
to
myself
there
is
no
other
thing
but
a
babe
that
could
bring
about
all
this
and
so
that
one
is
in
hiding
here
somewhere
i
know
i
stayed
but
a
moment
and
saw
nothing
more
and
heard
not
a
sound
yet
i
knew
i
was
right
what
else
could
the
shoe
mean
that
lay
on
the
floor
the
book
and
the
toy
and
the
faces
so
bright
and
what
made
the
husband
as
still
as
a
mouse
i
am
sure
sure
there
a
babe
in
that
house
the
foolish
elm
the
bold
young
autumn
came
riding
along
one
day
where
an
grew
you
are
fair
he
said
as
she
bent
down
her
head
too
fair
for
your
robe
dull
hue
you
are
far
too
young
for
a
garb
so
old
your
beauty
needs
colour
and
sheen
oh
i
would
clothe
you
in
scarlet
and
gold
befitting
the
grace
of
a
queen
for
one
little
kiss
on
your
lips
sweet
elm
for
one
little
kiss
no
more
i
would
give
you
i
swear
a
robe
more
fair
than
ever
a
princess
wore
one
little
kiss
on
those
lips
my
pet
and
lo
you
shall
stand
i
say
queen
of
the
forest
and
better
yet
queen
of
my
heart
alway
she
tossed
her
head
but
he
took
the
kiss
is
the
way
of
lovers
bold
and
a
gorgeous
dress
for
that
sweet
caress
he
gave
ere
the
morning
was
old
for
a
week
and
a
day
she
ruled
a
queen
in
beauty
and
splendid
attire
for
a
week
and
a
day
she
was
loved
i
ween
with
the
love
that
is
born
of
desire
then
autumn
went
on
his
way
in
search
of
a
tree
more
fair
and
tattered
her
garments
and
scattered
her
finery
here
and
there
poor
and
faded
and
ragged
and
cold
she
rocked
in
her
wild
distress
and
longed
for
the
dull
green
gown
she
had
sold
for
her
fickle
lover
caress
and
the
days
went
by
and
winter
came
and
his
tyrannous
tempests
beat
on
the
shivering
tree
whose
robes
of
flame
he
had
trampled
under
his
feet
i
saw
her
reach
up
to
the
mocking
skies
her
poor
arms
bare
and
thin
ah
it
is
ever
the
way
with
a
woman
who
trades
with
sin
robin
mistake
what
do
you
think
red
robin
found
by
a
mow
of
hay
why
a
flask
brimful
of
liquor
that
the
mowers
brought
that
day
to
slake
their
thirst
in
the
hayfield
and
robin
he
shook
his
head
now
i
wonder
what
they
call
it
and
how
it
tastes
he
said
i
have
seen
the
mowers
drink
it
why
is
it
good
for
me
so
i
just
draw
out
the
stopper
and
get
at
the
stuff
and
see
but
alas
for
the
curious
robin
one
draught
and
he
burned
his
throat
from
his
bill
to
his
poor
crop
lining
and
he
could
not
utter
a
note
and
his
head
grew
light
and
dizzy
and
he
staggered
left
and
right
tipped
over
the
flask
of
brandy
and
spilled
it
every
mite
but
after
awhile
he
sobered
and
quietly
flew
away
and
he
never
has
tasted
liquor
or
touched
it
since
that
day
but
i
heard
him
say
to
his
kindred
in
the
course
of
a
friendly
chat
these
men
think
they
are
above
us
yet
they
drink
such
stuff
as
that
oh
the
poor
degraded
creatures
i
am
glad
i
am
only
a
bird
then
he
flew
up
over
the
meadow
and
that
was
all
i
heard
new
year
resolve
as
the
dead
year
is
clasped
by
a
dead
december
so
let
your
dead
sins
with
your
dead
days
lie
a
new
life
is
yours
and
a
new
hope
remember
we
build
our
own
ladders
to
climb
to
the
sky
stand
out
in
the
sunlight
of
promise
forgetting
whatever
the
past
held
of
sorrow
and
wrong
we
waste
half
our
strength
in
a
useless
regretting
we
sit
by
old
tombs
in
the
dark
too
long
have
you
missed
in
your
aim
well
the
mark
is
still
shining
did
you
faint
in
the
race
well
take
breath
for
the
next
did
the
clouds
drive
you
back
but
see
yonder
their
lining
were
you
tempted
and
fell
let
it
serve
for
a
text
as
each
year
hurries
by
let
it
join
that
procession
of
skeleton
shapes
that
march
down
to
the
past
while
you
take
your
place
in
the
line
of
progression
with
your
eyes
to
the
heavens
your
face
to
the
blast
i
tell
you
the
future
can
hold
no
terrors
for
any
sad
soul
while
the
stars
revolve
if
he
will
stand
firm
on
the
grave
of
his
errors
and
instead
of
regretting
resolve
resolve
it
is
never
too
late
to
begin
rebuilding
though
all
into
ruins
your
life
seems
hurled
for
see
how
the
light
of
the
new
year
is
gilding
the
wan
worn
face
of
the
bruised
old
world
what
we
want
all
hail
the
dawn
of
a
new
day
breaking
when
a
nation
shall
take
away
the
weary
burdens
from
backs
that
are
aching
with
maximum
labour
and
minimum
pay
when
no
man
is
honoured
who
hoards
his
millions
when
no
man
feasts
on
another
toil
and
god
poor
suffering
striving
billions
shall
share
his
riches
of
sun
and
soil
there
is
gold
for
all
in
the
earth
broad
bosom
there
is
food
for
all
in
the
land
great
store
enough
is
provided
if
rightly
divided
let
each
man
take
what
he
needs
no
more
shame
on
the
miser
with
unused
riches
who
robs
the
toiler
to
swell
his
hoard
who
beats
down
the
wage
of
the
digger
of
ditches
and
steals
the
bread
from
the
poor
man
board
shame
on
the
owner
of
mines
whose
cruel
and
selfish
measures
have
brought
him
wealth
while
the
ragged
wretches
who
dig
his
fuel
are
robbed
of
comfort
and
hope
and
health
shame
on
the
ruler
who
rides
in
his
carriage
bought
with
the
labour
of
men
men
who
are
shut
out
of
home
and
marriage
and
are
herded
like
sheep
in
a
let
the
clarion
voice
of
the
nation
wake
him
to
broader
vision
and
fairer
play
or
let
the
hand
of
a
just
law
shake
him
till
his
dollars
shall
roll
away
let
no
man
dwell
under
a
mountain
of
plunder
let
no
man
suffer
with
want
and
cold
we
want
right
living
not
mere
we
want
just
dividing
of
labour
and
gold
breaking
the
day
in
two
when
from
dawn
till
noon
seems
one
long
day
and
from
noon
till
night
another
oh
then
should
a
little
boy
come
from
play
and
creep
into
the
arms
of
his
mother
snugly
creep
and
fall
asleep
oh
come
my
baby
do
creep
into
my
lap
and
with
a
nap
we
break
the
day
in
two
when
the
shadows
slant
for
afternoon
when
the
midday
meal
is
over
when
the
winds
have
sung
themselves
into
a
swoon
and
the
bees
drone
in
the
clover
then
hie
to
me
hie
for
a
lullaby
come
my
baby
do
creep
into
my
lap
and
with
a
nap
we
break
the
day
in
two
we
break
it
in
two
with
a
crooning
song
with
a
soft
and
soothing
number
for
the
day
has
no
right
to
be
so
long
and
keep
my
baby
from
slumber
then
rock
may
white
dreams
flock
like
angels
over
you
baby
gone
and
the
deed
is
done
we
broken
the
day
in
two
the
rape
of
the
mist
high
the
clouds
a
sunbeam
shone
and
far
down
under
him
with
a
subtle
grace
that
was
all
her
own
the
mist
gleamed
fair
and
dim
he
looked
at
her
with
his
burning
eyes
and
longed
to
fall
at
her
feet
of
all
sweet
things
there
under
the
skies
he
thought
her
the
thing
most
sweet
he
had
wooed
oft
as
a
sunbeam
may
wave
and
blossom
and
flower
but
never
before
had
he
felt
the
sway
of
a
great
love
mighty
power
tall
and
vast
wind
and
tempest
and
fire
what
are
obstacles
such
as
these
to
a
heart
that
is
filled
with
desire
boldly
he
trod
over
cloud
and
star
boldly
he
swam
through
space
she
caught
the
glow
of
his
eyes
afar
and
veiled
her
delicate
face
he
was
so
strong
and
he
was
so
bright
and
his
breath
was
a
breath
of
flame
the
mist
grew
pale
with
a
vague
strange
fright
as
fond
yet
fierce
he
came
close
to
his
heart
she
was
clasped
and
kissed
she
swooned
in
love
alarms
and
dead
lay
the
beautiful
mist
in
the
sunbeam
passionate
arms
the
two
glasses
there
sat
two
glasses
filled
to
the
brim
on
a
rich
man
table
rim
to
rim
one
was
ruddy
and
red
as
blood
and
one
was
as
clear
as
the
crystal
flood
said
the
glass
of
wine
to
his
paler
brother
let
us
tell
tales
of
the
past
to
each
other
i
can
tell
of
banquet
and
revel
and
mirth
where
i
was
king
for
i
ruled
in
might
and
the
proudest
and
grandest
souls
on
earth
fell
under
my
touch
as
though
struck
with
blight
from
the
heads
of
kings
i
have
torn
the
crown
from
the
heights
of
fame
i
have
hurled
men
down
i
have
blasted
many
an
honoured
name
i
have
taken
virtue
and
given
shame
i
have
tempted
the
youth
with
a
sip
a
taste
that
has
made
his
future
a
barren
waste
far
greater
than
any
king
am
i
or
than
any
army
under
the
sky
i
have
made
the
arm
of
the
driver
fail
and
sent
the
train
from
its
iron
rail
i
have
made
good
ships
go
down
at
sea
and
the
shrieks
of
the
lost
were
sweet
to
me
fame
strength
wealth
genius
before
me
fall
and
my
might
and
power
are
over
all
ho
ho
pale
brother
laughed
the
wine
can
you
boast
of
deeds
as
great
as
mine
said
the
glass
of
water
i
can
not
boast
of
a
king
dethroned
or
a
murdered
host
but
i
can
tell
of
hearts
that
were
sad
by
my
crystal
drops
made
light
and
glad
of
thirsts
i
have
quenched
and
brows
i
have
laved
of
hands
i
have
cooled
and
souls
i
have
saved
i
have
leaped
through
the
valley
and
dashed
down
the
mountain
slept
in
the
sunshine
and
dripped
from
the
fountain
i
have
burst
my
and
dropped
from
the
sky
and
everywhere
gladdened
the
landscape
and
eye
i
have
eased
the
hot
forehead
of
fever
and
pain
i
have
made
the
parched
meadows
grow
fertile
with
grain
i
can
tell
of
the
powerful
wheel
o
the
mill
that
ground
out
the
flour
and
turned
at
my
will
i
can
tell
of
manhood
debased
by
you
that
i
have
uplifted
and
crowned
anew
i
cheer
i
help
i
strengthen
and
aid
i
gladden
the
heart
of
man
and
maid
i
set
the
chained
free
and
all
are
better
for
knowing
me
these
are
the
tales
they
told
each
other
the
glass
of
wine
and
its
paler
brother
as
they
sat
together
filled
to
the
brim
on
the
rich
man
table
rim
to
rim
the
maniac
i
saw
them
sitting
in
the
shade
the
long
green
vines
hung
over
but
could
not
hide
the
maid
and
earl
my
lover
his
arm
was
clasped
so
close
so
close
her
eyes
were
softly
lifted
while
his
eyes
drank
the
cheek
of
rose
and
breasts
like
snowflakes
drifted
a
strange
noise
sounded
in
my
brain
i
was
a
guest
unbidden
i
stole
away
but
came
again
with
two
knives
snugly
hidden
i
stood
behind
them
close
they
kissed
while
eye
to
eye
was
speaking
i
aimed
my
steels
and
neither
missed
the
heart
i
sent
it
seeking
there
were
two
mingled
so
it
seemed
like
one
voice
crying
i
laughed
it
was
such
bliss
you
know
to
hear
and
see
them
dying
i
laughed
and
shouted
while
i
stood
above
the
lovers
gazing
upon
the
trickling
rills
of
blood
and
frightened
eyes
fast
glazing
it
was
such
joy
to
see
the
rose
fade
from
her
cheek
for
ever
to
know
the
lips
he
kissed
so
close
could
answer
never
never
to
see
his
arm
grow
stark
and
cold
and
know
it
could
not
hold
her
to
know
that
while
the
world
grew
old
his
eyes
could
not
behold
her
a
crowd
of
people
thronged
about
brought
thither
by
my
laughter
i
gave
one
last
triumphant
shout
then
darkness
followed
after
that
was
a
thousand
years
ago
each
hour
i
live
it
over
for
there
just
out
of
reach
you
know
lies
with
earl
my
lover
they
lie
there
staring
staring
so
with
great
glazed
eyes
to
taunt
me
will
no
one
bury
them
down
low
where
they
shall
cease
to
haunt
me
he
kissed
her
lips
not
mine
the
flowers
and
vines
hung
all
about
them
sometimes
i
sit
and
laugh
for
hours
to
think
just
how
i
found
them
and
then
i
sometimes
stand
and
shriek
in
agony
of
terror
i
see
the
red
warm
in
her
cheek
then
laugh
loud
at
my
error
my
cheek
was
all
too
pale
he
thought
he
deemed
hers
far
the
brightest
ha
but
my
dagger
touched
a
spot
that
made
face
the
whitest
but
oh
the
days
seem
very
long
without
my
earl
my
lover
and
something
in
my
head
seems
wrong
the
more
i
think
it
over
ah
look
she
is
not
dead
look
there
she
standing
close
beside
me
her
eyes
are
open
how
they
stare
oh
hide
me
hide
me
hide
me
what
is
flirtation
what
is
flirtation
really
how
can
i
tell
you
that
but
when
she
smiles
i
see
its
wiles
and
when
he
lifts
his
hat
is
walking
in
the
moonlight
is
buttoning
on
a
glove
lips
that
speak
of
plays
next
week
while
eyes
are
talking
love
is
meeting
in
the
is
whirling
in
the
dance
something
hid
beneath
the
lid
more
than
a
simple
glance
is
lingering
in
the
hallway
is
sitting
on
the
stair
bearded
lips
on
if
mamma
is
there
is
tucking
in
the
carriage
is
asking
for
a
call
long
in
tender
lights
and
that
is
no
not
all
is
parting
when
it
over
and
one
goes
home
to
sleep
best
joys
must
end
tra
la
my
friend
but
one
goes
home
to
weep
husband
and
wife
reach
out
your
arms
and
hold
me
close
and
fast
tell
me
you
have
no
memories
of
your
past
that
mar
this
love
of
ours
so
great
so
vast
some
truths
are
cheapened
when
too
oft
averred
does
not
the
deed
speak
louder
than
the
word
old
dream
woke
again
and
as
you
love
me
you
never
loved
before
though
oft
you
say
it
say
it
yet
once
more
my
heart
is
jealous
of
those
days
of
yore
sweet
wife
dear
comrade
mother
of
my
child
my
life
is
yours
by
memory
undefiled
stirs
passion
brief
and
you
never
knew
such
happy
hours
as
this
we
two
alone
our
hearts
surcharged
with
bliss
nor
other
kisses
sweet
as
my
own
kiss
i
was
the
thirsty
field
long
parched
with
drouth
you
were
the
warm
rain
blowing
from
the
south
crimson
madness
of
her
you
would
not
if
you
could
go
down
life
track
for
just
one
little
moment
and
bring
back
some
vanished
raptures
that
you
miss
or
lack
i
am
content
you
are
my
life
my
all
burning
i
men
driven
to
the
how
does
love
speak
how
does
love
speak
in
the
faint
flush
upon
the
cheek
and
in
the
pallor
that
succeeds
it
by
the
quivering
lid
of
an
averted
eye
the
smile
that
proves
the
parent
of
a
sigh
thus
doth
love
speak
how
does
love
speak
by
the
uneven
and
the
freak
of
bounding
pulses
that
stand
still
and
ache
while
new
emotions
like
strange
barges
make
along
their
disturbing
course
still
as
the
dawn
and
with
the
dawn
swift
force
thus
doth
love
speak
how
does
love
speak
in
the
avoidance
of
that
which
we
seek
the
sudden
silence
and
reserve
when
near
the
eye
that
glistens
with
an
unshed
tear
the
joy
that
seems
the
counterpart
of
fear
as
the
alarmed
heart
leads
in
the
breast
and
knows
and
names
and
greets
its
godlike
guest
thus
doth
love
speak
how
does
love
speak
in
the
proud
spirit
suddenly
grown
meek
the
haughty
heart
grown
humble
in
the
tender
and
unnamed
light
that
floods
the
world
with
splendour
in
the
resemblance
which
the
fond
eyes
trace
in
all
fair
things
to
one
beloved
face
in
the
shy
touch
of
hands
that
thrill
and
tremble
in
looks
and
lips
that
can
no
more
dissemble
thus
doth
love
speak
how
does
love
speak
in
wild
words
that
uttered
seem
so
weak
they
shrink
ashamed
to
silence
in
the
fire
glance
strikes
with
glance
swift
flashing
high
and
higher
like
lightnings
that
precede
the
mighty
storm
in
the
deep
soulful
stillness
in
the
warm
impassioned
tide
that
sweeps
thro
throbbing
veins
between
the
shores
of
keen
delights
and
pains
in
the
embrace
where
madness
melts
in
bliss
and
in
the
convulsive
rapture
of
a
kiss
thus
doth
love
speak
reincarnation
he
slept
as
weary
toilers
do
she
gazed
up
at
the
moon
he
stirred
and
said
wife
come
to
bed
she
answered
soon
full
soon
oh
that
strange
mystery
of
the
dead
moon
face
her
cheek
was
wan
her
wistful
mouth
was
lifted
like
a
cup
the
moonful
night
dripped
liquid
light
she
seemed
to
quaff
it
up
oh
that
unburied
corpse
that
lies
in
space
her
life
had
held
but
drudgery
she
spelled
her
bible
thro
of
books
and
lore
she
knew
no
more
than
little
children
do
oh
the
weird
wonder
of
that
pallid
sphere
her
youth
had
been
a
loveless
waste
starred
by
no
holiday
and
she
had
wed
for
roof
and
bread
she
gave
her
work
in
pay
oh
the
vague
and
strange
and
dear
she
drank
the
night
insidious
wine
and
saw
another
scene
a
stately
room
rare
flowers
in
bloom
herself
in
silken
sheen
oh
vast
the
chambers
of
the
moon
and
wide
a
step
drew
near
a
curtain
stirred
she
shook
with
sweet
alarms
oh
splendid
face
oh
manly
grace
oh
strong
impassioned
arms
oh
silent
moon
what
secrets
do
you
hide
the
warm
red
lips
of
thirsting
love
on
cheek
and
brow
were
pressed
as
the
bees
know
where
honeys
grow
they
sought
her
mouth
her
breast
oh
the
dead
moon
holds
many
a
dead
delight
the
speaker
stirred
and
gruffly
spake
come
wife
where
have
you
been
she
whispered
low
dear
god
i
go
but
is
the
seventh
sin
oh
the
sad
secrets
of
that
orb
of
white
as
you
go
through
life
do
look
for
the
flaws
as
you
go
through
life
and
even
when
you
find
them
it
is
wise
and
kind
to
be
somewhat
blind
and
look
for
the
virtue
behind
them
for
the
cloudiest
night
has
a
hint
of
light
somewhere
in
its
shadows
hiding
it
is
better
by
far
to
hunt
for
a
star
than
the
spots
on
the
sun
abiding
the
current
of
life
runs
ever
away
to
the
bosom
of
god
great
ocean
do
set
your
force
the
river
course
and
think
to
alter
its
motion
do
waste
a
curse
on
the
universe
remember
it
lived
before
you
do
butt
at
the
storm
with
your
puny
form
but
bend
and
let
it
go
you
the
world
will
never
adjust
itself
to
suit
your
whims
to
the
letter
some
things
must
go
wrong
your
whole
life
long
and
the
sooner
you
know
it
the
better
it
is
folly
to
fight
with
the
infinite
and
go
under
at
last
in
the
wrestle
the
wiser
man
shapes
into
god
plan
as
water
shapes
into
a
vessel
how
salvator
won
the
gate
was
thrown
open
i
rode
out
alone
more
proud
than
a
monarch
who
sits
on
a
throne
i
am
but
a
jockey
yet
shout
upon
shout
went
up
from
the
people
who
watched
me
ride
out
and
the
cheers
that
rang
forth
from
that
crowd
were
as
earnest
as
those
to
which
monarch
bowed
my
heart
thrilled
with
pleasure
so
keen
it
was
pain
as
i
patted
my
salvator
soft
silken
mane
and
a
sweet
shiver
shot
from
his
hide
to
my
hand
as
we
passed
by
the
multitude
down
to
the
stand
the
great
waves
of
cheering
came
billowing
back
as
the
hoofs
of
brave
tenny
rang
swift
down
the
track
and
he
stood
there
beside
us
all
bone
and
all
muscle
our
noble
opponent
well
trained
for
the
tussle
that
waited
us
there
on
the
smooth
shining
course
my
salvator
fair
to
the
lovers
of
horse
as
a
beautiful
woman
is
fair
to
man
sight
pure
type
of
the
thoroughbred
and
bright
stood
taking
the
plaudits
as
only
his
due
and
nothing
at
all
unexpected
or
new
and
then
there
before
us
the
bright
flag
is
spread
there
a
roar
from
the
grand
stand
and
tenny
ahead
at
the
sound
of
the
voices
that
shouted
a
go
he
sprang
like
an
arrow
shot
straight
from
the
bow
i
tighten
the
reins
on
prince
charlie
great
son
he
is
off
like
a
rocket
the
race
is
begun
down
the
furlong
their
heads
are
together
scarce
room
their
noses
to
wedge
in
a
feather
past
grand
stand
and
judges
in
strife
ah
salvator
boy
is
the
race
of
your
life
i
press
my
knees
closer
i
coax
him
i
urge
i
feel
him
go
out
with
a
leap
and
a
surge
i
see
him
creep
on
inch
by
inch
stride
by
stride
while
backward
still
backward
falls
tenny
beside
we
are
nearing
the
turn
the
first
quarter
is
past
leader
and
chaser
the
daylight
is
cast
the
distance
elongates
still
tenny
sweeps
on
as
graceful
and
and
swift
as
a
fawn
his
awkwardness
vanished
his
muscles
all
strained
a
noble
opponent
well
born
and
well
trained
i
glanced
my
shoulder
ha
tenny
the
cost
of
that
one
second
flagging
will
be
the
race
lost
one
second
weak
yielding
of
courage
and
strength
and
the
daylight
between
us
has
doubled
its
length
the
first
mile
is
covered
the
race
is
mine
no
for
the
blue
blood
of
tenny
responds
to
a
blow
he
shoots
through
the
air
like
a
ball
from
a
gun
and
the
two
lengths
between
us
are
shortened
to
one
my
heart
is
contracted
my
throat
feels
a
lump
for
tenny
long
neck
is
at
salvator
rump
and
now
with
new
courage
grown
bolder
and
bolder
i
see
him
once
more
running
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
knees
hands
and
body
i
press
my
grand
steed
i
urge
him
i
coax
him
i
pray
him
to
heed
oh
salvator
salvator
list
to
my
calls
for
the
blow
of
my
whip
will
hurt
both
if
it
falls
there
a
roar
from
the
crowd
like
the
ocean
in
storm
as
close
to
my
saddle
leaps
tenny
great
form
one
more
mighty
plunge
and
with
knee
limb
and
hand
i
lift
my
horse
first
by
a
nose
past
the
stand
we
are
under
the
string
now
the
great
race
is
done
and
salvator
salvator
salvator
won
cheer
patriarchs
cheer
loud
i
say
is
the
race
of
a
century
witnessed
though
ye
live
twice
the
space
that
allotted
to
men
ye
never
will
see
such
a
grand
race
again
let
the
shouts
of
the
populace
roar
like
the
surf
for
salvator
salvator
king
of
the
turf
he
has
broken
the
record
of
thirteen
long
years
he
has
won
the
first
place
in
a
vast
line
of
peers
was
a
contest
a
grand
honest
race
and
even
his
enemies
grant
him
his
place
down
into
the
dust
let
old
records
be
hurled
and
hang
out
in
the
gaze
of
the
world
the
watcher
i
think
i
hear
the
sound
of
horses
feet
beating
upon
the
gravelled
avenue
go
to
the
window
that
looks
on
the
street
he
would
not
let
me
die
alone
i
knew
back
to
the
couch
the
patient
watcher
passed
and
said
it
is
the
wailing
of
the
blast
she
turned
upon
her
couch
and
seeming
slept
the
long
dark
lashes
shadowing
her
cheek
and
on
and
on
the
weary
moments
crept
when
suddenly
the
watcher
heard
her
speak
i
think
i
hear
the
sound
of
horses
hoofs
and
answered
is
the
rain
upon
the
roofs
unbroken
silence
quiet
deep
profound
the
restless
sleeper
turns
how
dark
how
late
what
is
it
that
i
hear
a
trampling
sound
i
think
there
is
a
horseman
at
the
gate
the
watcher
turns
away
her
eyes
it
is
the
shutter
beating
in
the
wind
the
dread
hours
passed
the
patient
clock
ticked
on
the
weary
watcher
moved
not
from
her
place
the
grey
dim
shadows
of
the
early
dawn
caught
sudden
glory
from
the
sleeper
face
he
comes
my
love
i
knew
he
would
she
cried
and
smiling
sweetly
in
her
slumbers
died
how
will
it
be
how
will
it
be
when
one
of
us
alone
goes
on
that
strange
last
journey
of
the
soul
that
certain
search
for
an
uncertain
goal
that
voyage
on
which
no
comradeship
is
known
will
our
dear
sea
sing
with
the
old
sweet
tone
though
one
sits
stricken
where
its
billows
roll
will
space
be
dumb
or
from
the
mystic
pole
will
be
backward
blown
when
our
united
lives
are
wrenched
apart
and
day
no
more
means
fond
companionship
when
fervent
night
and
lovely
languorous
dawn
are
only
memories
to
one
sad
heart
and
but
in
dreams
burn
the
lip
dear
god
how
can
this
same
fair
world
move
on
memory
river
in
nature
bright
blossoms
not
always
reposes
that
strange
subtle
essence
more
rare
than
their
bloom
which
lies
in
the
hearts
of
carnations
and
roses
that
unexplained
something
by
men
called
perfume
though
modest
the
flower
yet
great
is
its
power
and
pregnant
with
meaning
each
pistil
and
leaf
if
only
it
hides
there
if
only
abides
there
the
fragrance
suggestive
of
love
joy
and
grief
not
always
the
air
that
a
master
composes
can
stir
human
with
pleasure
or
pain
but
strange
subtle
chords
like
the
scent
of
the
roses
breathe
out
of
some
measures
though
simple
the
strain
and
lo
when
you
hear
them
you
love
them
and
fear
them
you
tremble
with
anguish
you
thrill
with
delight
for
back
of
them
slumber
old
dreams
without
number
and
faces
long
vanished
peer
out
into
sight
those
dear
foolish
days
when
the
earth
seemed
all
beauty
before
you
had
knowledge
enough
to
be
sad
when
youth
held
no
higher
ideal
of
duty
than
just
to
lilt
on
through
the
world
and
be
glad
on
harmony
river
they
seemed
to
afloat
hither
with
all
the
sweet
fancies
that
hung
round
that
time
life
burdens
and
troubles
turn
into
and
break
on
the
music
swift
current
of
rhyme
fair
folly
comes
back
with
her
spell
while
you
listen
and
points
to
the
paths
where
she
led
you
of
old
you
gaze
on
past
sunsets
you
see
dead
stars
glisten
you
bathe
in
life
glory
you
swoon
in
death
cold
all
pains
and
all
pleasures
surge
up
through
those
measures
your
heart
is
wrenched
open
with
earthquakes
of
sound
from
ashes
and
embers
rise
junes
and
decembers
lost
islands
in
fathoms
of
feeling
refound
some
airs
are
like
outlets
of
memory
oceans
they
rise
in
the
past
and
flow
into
the
heart
and
down
them
float
shipwrecks
of
mighty
emotions
all
and
and
drifting
apart
their
fair
timbers
battered
their
lordly
sails
tattered
their
skeleton
crew
of
dead
days
on
their
decks
then
a
crash
of
chords
blending
a
crisis
an
ending
the
music
is
over
and
vanished
the
wrecks
love
way
love
gives
us
copious
potions
of
delight
of
pain
and
ecstasy
and
peace
and
care
love
leads
us
upward
to
the
mountain
height
and
like
an
angel
stands
beside
us
there
then
thrusts
us
in
some
abyss
where
in
the
darkness
of
despair
we
grope
till
suddenly
love
greets
us
with
a
kiss
and
guides
us
back
to
flowery
fields
of
hope
love
makes
all
wisdom
seem
but
poorest
folly
and
yet
the
simplest
mind
with
love
grows
wise
the
gayest
heart
he
teaches
melancholy
yet
glorifies
the
erstwhile
brooding
eyes
love
lives
on
change
and
yet
at
change
love
mocks
for
love
whole
life
is
one
great
paradox
a
man
last
love
like
the
tenth
wave
that
offers
to
the
shore
accumulated
opulence
and
force
so
does
my
heart
which
thought
it
loved
of
yore
carry
increasing
passion
down
the
course
of
time
to
proffer
thee
oh
not
the
faint
first
ripple
of
the
sea
should
be
its
pride
but
the
great
climax
of
its
unrestraint
which
culminates
in
one
commanding
tide
the
lesser
billows
of
each
crude
emotion
break
on
life
strand
recede
and
then
unite
with
love
large
sea
and
to
some
late
devotion
unrecognised
they
bring
their
lost
delight
so
all
the
vanished
fancies
of
my
past
live
yet
in
this
one
passion
grand
and
vast
the
lady
and
the
dame
so
thou
hast
the
art
good
dame
thou
swearest
to
keep
time
perishing
touch
at
bay
from
the
roseate
splendour
of
the
cheek
so
tender
and
the
silver
threads
from
the
gold
away
and
the
years
that
have
hurried
by
us
shall
tiptoe
back
and
with
kind
they
shall
take
their
traces
from
off
our
faces
if
we
will
trust
to
thy
magic
skill
thou
speakest
fairly
but
if
i
listen
and
buy
thy
secret
and
prove
its
truth
hast
thou
the
potion
and
magic
lotion
to
give
me
also
the
of
youth
with
the
cheek
of
rose
and
the
eye
of
beauty
and
the
lustrous
locks
of
life
lost
prime
wilt
thou
bring
thronging
each
hope
and
longing
that
made
the
glory
of
that
dead
time
when
the
sap
in
the
trees
sets
young
buds
bursting
and
the
song
of
the
birds
fills
the
air
like
spray
will
rivers
of
feeling
come
once
more
stealing
from
the
beautiful
hills
of
the
wilt
thou
demolish
the
tower
of
reason
and
fling
for
ever
down
into
the
dust
the
caution
time
brought
me
the
lessons
life
taught
me
and
put
in
their
places
my
old
sweet
trust
if
time
footprint
from
my
brow
is
driven
canst
thou
too
take
with
thy
subtle
powers
the
burden
of
thinking
and
let
me
go
drinking
the
careless
pleasures
of
youth
bright
hours
if
silver
threads
from
my
tresses
vanish
if
a
glow
once
more
in
my
pale
cheek
gleams
wilt
thou
slay
duty
and
give
back
the
beauty
of
days
untroubled
by
aught
but
dreams
when
the
soft
fair
arms
of
the
siren
summer
encircle
the
earth
in
their
languorous
fold
will
vast
deep
oceans
of
sweet
emotions
surge
through
my
veins
as
they
surged
of
old
canst
thou
bring
back
from
a
day
long
vanished
the
leaping
pulse
and
the
boundless
aim
i
will
pay
thee
double
for
all
thy
trouble
if
thou
wilt
restore
all
these
good
dame
confession
i
how
shall
a
maid
make
answer
to
a
man
who
summons
her
by
love
supreme
decree
to
open
her
whole
heart
that
he
may
see
the
intricate
strange
ways
that
love
began
so
many
streams
from
that
great
fountain
ran
to
feed
the
river
that
now
rushes
free
so
deep
the
heart
so
full
of
mystery
how
shall
a
maid
make
answer
to
a
man
if
i
turn
back
each
leaflet
of
my
heart
and
let
your
eyes
scan
all
the
records
there
of
dreams
of
love
that
came
before
i
knew
though
in
those
dreams
you
had
no
place
or
part
yet
know
that
each
emotion
was
a
stair
which
led
my
ripening
womanhood
to
you
ii
nay
i
was
not
insensate
till
you
came
i
know
man
likes
to
think
a
woman
clay
devoid
of
feeling
till
the
warming
ray
sent
from
his
heart
lights
her
with
sudden
flame
you
asked
for
truth
i
answer
without
shame
my
human
heart
pulsed
blood
by
night
and
day
and
i
believed
that
love
had
come
my
way
before
he
conquered
with
your
face
and
name
i
do
not
know
when
first
i
felt
this
fire
that
lends
such
lustre
to
my
hopes
and
fears
and
burns
a
pathway
to
you
with
each
thought
i
think
in
that
great
hour
when
god
desire
for
worlds
to
love
flung
forth
a
million
spheres
this
miracle
of
love
in
me
was
wrought
an
open
door
a
moonlit
sky
a
maid
with
musing
eye
a
manly
footstep
passing
by
light
as
a
dewdrop
falls
from
space
upon
a
rosebud
folded
grace
a
kiss
fell
on
her
girlish
face
and
he
was
gone
and
so
was
childhood
it
was
dawn
in
that
young
heart
the
moon
shone
on
his
name
his
face
dim
memories
i
only
know
in
that
first
kiss
was
prophesied
this
later
bliss
the
dreams
within
my
bosom
grew
nay
grieve
not
that
my
tale
is
true
since
all
those
dreams
led
straight
to
you
one
time
when
autumn
donned
her
robes
of
splendour
and
rustled
down
the
year
receding
track
as
i
passed
dreaming
by
a
voice
all
tender
haled
me
with
youth
soft
call
to
linger
back
i
turned
and
listened
to
a
golden
story
a
wondrous
tale
half
human
half
divine
a
page
from
bright
september
book
of
glory
to
memorise
and
make
forever
mine
strange
argosies
from
passion
unknown
oceans
cruised
down
my
veins
a
vague
elusive
fleet
with
foreign
cargoes
of
unnamed
emotions
while
wafts
of
song
blew
shoreward
dim
and
sweet
and
sleeping
still
because
unwaked
by
you
i
dreamed
and
dreamed
and
thought
my
visions
true
i
woke
when
all
the
crimson
colour
faded
and
wanton
autumn
lips
and
cheeks
were
pale
and
when
the
sorrowing
year
had
slowly
waded
with
failing
footsteps
through
the
vale
i
woke
and
knew
the
glamour
of
a
season
had
lent
illusive
lustre
to
a
dream
and
looking
in
the
clear
calm
eyes
of
reason
i
smiled
and
said
farewell
to
things
that
seem
was
but
a
red
leaf
from
a
lush
september
the
wind
of
dreams
across
my
pathway
blew
but
oh
my
love
the
whole
round
year
remember
with
all
its
seasons
i
bestow
on
you
the
red
leaf
perished
in
the
first
cold
blast
the
full
year
harvests
at
your
feet
i
cast
absolve
me
prince
confession
is
all
over
but
listen
and
take
warning
oh
my
lover
you
put
to
rout
all
dreams
that
may
have
been
you
won
the
day
but
is
not
all
to
win
guard
well
the
fort
lest
new
dreams
enter
in
a
married
coquette
sit
still
i
say
and
dispense
with
heroics
i
hurt
your
wrists
well
you
have
hurt
me
it
is
time
you
found
out
that
all
men
are
not
stoics
nor
toys
to
be
used
as
your
mood
may
be
will
let
go
of
your
hands
nor
leave
you
until
i
have
spoken
no
man
you
say
dared
ever
so
treat
you
before
i
believe
you
for
you
have
dealt
only
with
till
you
women
lay
stress
on
your
fine
perception
your
intuitions
are
prated
about
you
claim
an
occult
sort
of
conception
of
matters
which
men
must
reason
out
so
then
of
course
when
you
ask
me
kindly
to
call
again
soon
you
read
my
heart
i
can
not
believe
you
were
acting
blindly
you
saw
my
passion
for
you
from
the
start
you
are
one
of
those
women
who
charm
without
trying
the
clay
you
are
made
of
is
magnet
ore
and
i
am
the
steel
yet
there
no
denying
you
led
me
to
loving
you
more
and
more
you
are
fanning
a
flame
that
may
burn
too
brightly
oft
easily
kindled
but
hard
to
put
out
i
am
not
a
man
to
be
played
with
lightly
to
come
at
a
gesture
and
go
at
a
pout
a
brute
you
call
me
a
creature
inhuman
you
say
i
insult
you
and
bid
me
go
and
you
oh
you
are
a
saintly
woman
with
thoughts
as
pure
as
the
drifted
snow
pah
you
are
but
one
of
a
thousand
beauties
who
think
they
are
living
exemplary
lives
they
break
no
commandments
and
do
all
their
duties
as
christian
women
and
spotless
wives
but
with
drooping
of
lids
and
lifting
of
faces
and
baring
of
shoulders
and
sighs
and
the
devil
knows
what
other
subtle
graces
you
are
mental
wantons
who
sin
with
the
eyes
you
lure
love
to
wake
yet
bid
it
keep
under
you
tempt
us
to
fall
but
bid
reason
control
and
then
you
are
full
of
an
outraged
wonder
when
we
get
to
wanting
you
body
and
soul
why
look
at
yourself
you
were
no
stranger
to
the
fact
that
my
heart
was
already
on
fire
when
you
asked
me
to
call
you
knew
my
danger
yet
here
you
are
dressed
in
the
gown
i
admire
for
half
of
the
evil
on
earth
is
invented
by
vain
pretty
women
with
nothing
to
do
but
to
keep
themselves
manicured
powdered
and
scented
and
seek
for
sensations
amusing
and
new
but
when
i
play
at
love
at
a
lady
commanding
i
always
am
certain
to
win
one
game
so
there
there
there
i
will
leave
my
branding
on
the
lips
that
are
free
now
to
cry
shame
shame
you
hate
me
quite
likely
it
does
not
surprise
me
brute
force
i
confess
it
still
you
were
and
one
thing
is
certain
you
can
not
despise
me
for
having
been
played
with
controlled
and
dismissed
and
the
next
time
you
see
that
a
man
is
attracted
by
the
beauty
and
graces
that
are
not
for
him
do
lead
him
on
to
be
half
distracted
keep
out
of
deep
waters
although
you
can
swim
for
when
he
is
caught
in
the
whirlpool
of
passion
where
many
bold
swimmers
are
seen
to
drown
a
man
will
reach
out
and
in
desperate
fashion
will
drag
whoever
is
nearest
him
down
though
the
strings
of
his
heart
may
be
wrenched
and
riven
by
a
maiden
coquette
who
has
led
him
along
she
can
be
pardoned
excused
and
forgiven
for
innocence
blindfolded
walks
into
wrong
but
she
who
has
willingly
taken
the
fetter
that
cupid
forges
at
hymen
command
well
she
is
the
woman
who
ought
to
know
better
she
needs
no
mercy
at
any
man
hand
in
the
game
of
hearts
though
a
woman
be
winner
the
odds
are
ever
against
her
you
know
the
world
is
ready
to
call
her
a
sinner
and
man
is
ready
to
make
her
so
shame
is
likely
and
sorrow
is
certain
and
the
man
has
the
best
of
it
end
as
it
may
so
now
my
lady
we
drop
the
curtain
and
put
out
the
lights
we
are
through
with
our
play
forbidden
speech
the
passion
you
forbade
my
lips
to
utter
will
not
be
silenced
you
must
hear
it
in
the
sullen
thunders
when
they
roll
and
mutter
and
when
the
tempest
nears
with
wail
and
din
i
know
your
calm
forgetfulness
is
broken
and
to
your
heart
you
whisper
he
has
spoken
all
nature
understands
and
sympathises
with
human
passion
when
the
restless
sea
turns
in
its
futile
search
for
peace
and
rises
to
plead
and
to
pursue
it
pleads
for
me
and
with
each
desperate
billow
anguished
fretting
your
heart
must
tell
you
he
is
not
forgetting
when
unseen
hands
in
lightning
strokes
are
writing
mysterious
words
upon
a
cloudy
scroll
know
that
my
passion
is
inditing
a
cypher
message
for
your
woman
soul
and
when
the
lawless
winds
rush
by
you
shrieking
let
your
heart
say
now
his
despair
is
speaking
love
comes
nor
goes
at
beck
or
call
of
reason
nor
is
love
silent
though
it
says
no
word
by
day
or
night
in
any
clime
or
season
a
dominating
passion
must
be
heard
so
shall
you
hear
through
junes
and
through
decembers
the
voice
of
nature
saying
he
remembers
the
summer
girl
she
the
jauntiest
of
creatures
she
the
daintiest
of
misses
with
her
pretty
patent
leathers
or
her
alligator
ties
with
her
eyes
inviting
glances
and
her
lips
inviting
kisses
as
she
wanders
by
the
ocean
or
strolls
under
country
skies
she
a
captivating
dresser
and
her
parasols
are
stunning
her
fads
will
take
your
breath
away
her
hats
are
dreams
of
style
she
is
not
so
very
bookish
but
with
repartee
and
punning
she
can
set
the
savants
laughing
and
make
even
dudelets
smile
she
has
no
attacks
of
talent
she
is
not
a
maiden
she
is
wholly
free
from
hobbies
and
she
dreams
of
no
career
she
is
mostly
gay
and
happy
never
sad
or
though
she
sometimes
sighs
a
little
if
a
gentleman
is
near
she
a
sturdy
little
walker
and
she
braves
all
kinds
of
weather
and
when
the
rain
or
fog
or
mist
drive
rival
crimps
her
fluffy
hair
goes
curling
like
a
ostrich
feather
around
her
ears
and
forehead
and
the
white
nape
of
her
neck
she
is
like
a
fish
in
water
she
can
handle
reins
and
racket
from
head
to
toe
and
she
thoroughly
alive
when
she
goes
promenading
in
a
most
distracting
jacket
the
rustle
round
her
feet
suggests
how
laundresses
may
thrive
she
can
dare
the
wind
and
sunshine
in
the
most
bravado
manner
and
after
hours
of
sailing
she
has
merely
cheeks
of
rose
old
sol
himself
seems
smitten
and
at
most
will
only
tan
her
though
to
everybody
else
he
gives
a
nose
she
a
trifle
sentimental
and
she
fond
of
admiration
and
she
sometimes
flirts
a
little
in
the
season
giddy
whirl
but
win
her
if
you
can
sir
she
may
prove
your
life
salvation
for
an
angel
masquerading
oft
is
she
the
summer
girl
the
ghost
through
the
open
door
of
dreamland
came
a
ghost
of
long
ago
long
ago
when
i
wakened
all
unheeding
was
the
phantom
to
my
pleading
for
he
would
not
turn
and
go
but
beside
me
all
the
day
in
my
work
and
in
my
play
trod
this
ghost
of
long
ago
long
ago
not
a
vague
and
pallid
phantom
was
this
ghost
that
came
to
me
followed
me
though
he
rose
from
regions
haunted
though
he
came
unbid
unwanted
he
was
very
fair
to
see
like
the
radiant
sun
in
space
was
the
halo
round
the
face
of
that
ghost
that
came
to
me
followed
me
and
he
wore
no
shroud
or
as
he
wandered
at
my
side
close
beside
he
was
clothed
in
royal
splendour
and
his
eyes
were
deep
and
tender
while
he
walked
in
stately
pride
and
he
seemed
like
some
great
king
not
afraid
of
anything
as
he
wandered
at
my
side
close
beside
then
i
turned
to
him
commanding
that
he
go
the
way
he
came
whence
he
came
but
he
answered
me
in
sorrow
may
the
past
not
seek
to
borrow
from
the
present
without
blame
just
one
memory
from
its
store
ere
it
goes
to
come
no
more
back
the
pathway
that
it
came
whence
it
came
then
ashamed
of
my
full
coffers
i
gave
forth
from
memory
hold
wondrous
hold
all
i
owed
of
tax
and
duty
for
remembered
hours
of
beauty
which
i
paid
in
thoughts
of
gold
yet
my
present
seemed
to
be
richer
still
for
all
the
fee
i
gave
forth
from
memory
hold
wondrous
hold
the
signboard
i
will
paint
you
a
sign
rumseller
and
hang
it
above
your
door
a
truer
and
better
signboard
than
ever
you
had
before
i
will
paint
with
the
skill
of
a
master
and
many
shall
pause
to
see
this
wonderful
piece
of
painting
so
like
the
reality
i
will
paint
yourself
rumseller
as
you
wait
for
that
fair
young
boy
just
in
the
morning
of
manhood
a
mother
pride
and
joy
he
has
no
thought
of
stopping
but
you
greet
him
with
a
smile
and
you
seem
so
blithe
and
friendly
that
he
pauses
to
chat
awhile
i
will
paint
you
again
rumseller
i
will
paint
you
as
you
stand
with
a
foaming
glass
of
liquor
extended
in
your
hand
he
wavers
but
you
urge
him
drink
pledge
me
just
this
one
and
he
takes
the
glass
and
drains
it
and
the
hellish
work
is
done
and
next
i
will
paint
a
drunkard
only
a
year
has
flown
but
into
that
loathsome
creature
the
fair
young
boy
has
grown
the
work
was
sure
and
rapid
i
will
paint
him
as
he
lies
in
a
torpid
drunken
slumber
under
the
wintry
skies
i
will
paint
the
form
of
the
mother
as
she
kneels
at
her
darling
side
her
beautiful
boy
that
was
dearer
than
all
the
world
beside
i
will
paint
the
shape
of
a
coffin
labelled
with
one
word
lost
i
will
paint
all
this
rumseller
and
will
paint
it
free
of
cost
the
sin
and
the
shame
and
the
sorrow
the
crime
and
the
want
and
the
woe
that
are
born
there
in
your
workshop
no
hand
can
paint
you
know
but
i
paint
you
a
sign
rumseller
and
many
shall
pause
to
view
this
wonderful
swinging
signboard
so
terribly
fearfully
true
a
man
repentance
intended
for
recitation
at
club
dinners
when
i
came
from
the
club
at
eleven
under
the
gaslight
i
saw
a
face
a
woman
face
and
i
swear
to
heaven
it
looked
like
the
ghastly
ghost
of
grace
and
grace
why
grace
was
fair
and
i
tarried
and
loved
her
a
season
as
we
men
do
and
then
but
pshaw
why
of
course
she
is
married
has
a
husband
and
doubtless
a
babe
or
two
she
was
perfectly
calm
on
the
day
we
parted
she
spared
me
a
scene
to
my
great
surprise
she
was
the
kind
to
be
i
remember
she
said
with
a
spark
in
her
eyes
i
was
tempted
i
know
by
her
proud
defiance
to
make
good
my
promise
there
and
then
but
the
world
would
have
called
it
a
mesalliance
i
dreaded
the
comments
and
sneers
of
men
so
i
left
her
to
grieve
for
a
faithless
lover
and
to
hide
her
heart
from
the
cold
world
sight
as
women
do
hide
them
the
wide
earth
over
my
god
it
grace
that
i
saw
i
thought
of
her
married
and
often
with
pity
a
poor
man
wife
in
some
dull
place
and
now
to
know
she
is
here
in
the
city
under
the
gaslight
and
with
face
yet
i
knew
it
at
once
in
spite
of
the
daubing
of
paint
and
powder
and
she
knew
me
she
drew
a
quick
breath
that
was
almost
sobbing
and
shrank
in
the
shade
so
i
should
not
see
there
was
hell
in
her
eyes
she
was
worn
and
jaded
her
soul
is
at
war
with
the
life
she
has
led
as
i
looked
on
that
face
so
strangely
faded
i
wonder
god
did
not
strike
me
dead
while
i
have
been
happy
and
gay
and
jolly
received
by
the
very
best
people
in
town
that
girl
whom
i
led
in
the
way
to
folly
has
gone
on
recklessly
down
and
down
two
and
no
sleep
has
found
me
that
face
i
saw
in
the
light
peers
everywhere
out
from
the
shadows
around
me
i
know
how
a
murderer
feels
aristarchus
the
name
of
the
mountain
in
the
moon
it
was
long
and
long
ago
our
love
began
it
is
something
all
unmeasured
by
time
span
in
an
era
and
a
spot
by
the
modern
world
forgot
we
were
lovers
ere
god
named
us
maid
and
man
like
the
memory
of
music
made
by
streams
all
the
beauty
of
that
other
love
life
seems
but
i
always
thought
it
so
and
at
last
i
know
i
know
we
were
lovers
in
the
land
of
silver
dreams
when
the
moon
was
at
the
full
i
found
the
place
out
and
out
across
the
seas
of
shining
space
on
a
quest
that
could
not
fail
i
unfurled
my
memory
sail
and
cast
anchor
in
the
bay
of
love
first
grace
at
the
foot
of
aristarchus
lies
this
bay
oh
the
wonder
of
that
mountain
far
away
and
the
land
of
silver
dreams
all
about
it
shines
and
gleams
where
we
loved
before
god
fashioned
night
or
day
we
were
souls
in
eerie
bodies
made
of
light
we
were
winged
and
we
could
speed
from
height
to
height
and
we
built
a
nest
called
hope
on
the
sheer
moon
mountain
slope
where
we
sat
and
watched
new
worlds
wheel
into
sight
and
we
saw
this
little
planet
known
as
earth
when
the
mighty
mother
chaos
gave
it
birth
but
in
love
conceit
we
thought
all
those
worlds
from
space
were
brought
for
no
greater
aim
or
purpose
than
our
mirth
and
we
laughed
in
love
abandon
and
we
sang
till
the
echoing
peals
of
aristarchus
rang
as
hot
hissing
comets
came
and
white
suns
burst
into
flame
and
a
myriad
worlds
from
out
the
darkness
sprang
i
can
show
you
when
the
moon
is
at
its
best
aristarchus
and
the
spot
we
made
our
nest
oh
i
always
wondered
why
when
the
moon
was
in
the
sky
i
was
stirred
with
such
strange
longing
and
unrest
and
i
knew
the
subtle
beauty
and
the
force
of
our
love
was
never
bounded
by
earth
course
so
with
memory
sail
unfurled
i
went
cruising
past
this
world
and
i
followed
till
i
traced
it
to
its
source
dell
and
i
in
a
mansion
grand
just
over
the
way
lives
bonny
beautiful
dell
you
may
have
heard
of
this
lady
gay
for
she
is
a
famous
belle
i
live
in
a
low
cot
opposite
you
never
have
heard
of
me
for
when
the
lady
moon
shines
bright
who
would
a
pale
star
see
but
ah
well
ah
well
i
am
happier
far
than
dell
as
strange
as
that
may
be
dell
has
robes
of
the
richest
kind
pinks
and
purples
and
blues
and
she
worries
her
maid
and
frets
her
mind
to
know
which
one
to
choose
which
shall
it
be
now
silk
or
lace
in
which
will
i
be
most
fair
she
stands
by
the
mirror
with
anxious
face
and
her
maid
looks
on
in
despair
ah
well
ah
well
i
am
not
worried
you
see
like
dell
for
i
have
but
one
to
wear
dell
has
lovers
of
every

suitors
flutter
about
the
maid
and
bask
in
her
word
and
smile
she
keeps
them
all
with
a
coquette
art
as
suits
her
mood
or
mirth
and
vainly
wonders
if
in
heart
of
all
true
love

birth

never
question
myself
like
dell

and
sighs

day

a
glad
surprise

course

day
after

way
and

one
night
nurse

held
out
her
hand
to
tired
little
may
come

with
me
to
wonderland
she
said
i
know
the
way
just
and
lo
we
come
to
the
place
where
the
play
but
naughty
may
she
wriggled
away
from
sleep
soft
arms
and
said
i
must
stay
awake
till
i
eat
my
cake
and
then
i
will
go
to
bed
with
a
away
i
will
go
but
the
good
nurse
shook
her
head
she
shook
her
head
and
away
she
sped
while
may
sat
munching
her
crumb
but
after
the
cake
there
came
an
ache

may
cried
come
sleep

and
it
oh
my
let
us
all
save
the
echoes
were
dumb
she
ran
after
sleep
toward
wonderland
ran
till
the
morning
light
and
just
as
she
caught
her
and
grasped
her
hand
a
nightmare
gave
her
a
fright
and
it
i
hope
she
know
better
another
night
vanity
fair
in
vanity
fair
as
we
bow
and
smile
as
we
talk
of
the
opera
after
the
weather
as
we
chat
of
fashion
and
fad
and
style
we
know
we
are
playing
a
part
together
you
know
that
the
mirth
she
wears
she
borrows
she
knows
you
laugh
but
to
hide
your
sorrows
we
know
that
under
the
silks
and
laces
and
back
of
beautiful
beaming
faces
lie
secret
trouble
and
grim
despair
in
vanity
fair
in
vanity
fair
on
dress
parade
our
colours
look
bright
and
our
swords
are
gleaming
but
many
a
uniform
worn
and
frayed
and
most
of
the
weapons
despite
their
seeming
are
dull
and
blunted
and
badly
battered
and
close
inspection
will
show
how
tattered
and
stained
are
the
banners
that
float
above
us
our
comrades
hate
while
they
swear
to
love
us
and
robed
like
pleasure
walks
care
in
vanity
fair
in
vanity
fair
as
we
strive
for
place
as
we
rush
and
jostle
and
crowd
and
hurry
we
know
the
goal
is
not
worth
the
race
we
know
the
prize
is
not
worth
the
worry
that
all
our
gain
means
loss
for
another
that
in
fighting
for
self
we
wound
each
other
that
the
crown
of
success
weighs
hard
and
presses
the
brow
of
the
victor
with
thorns
not
caresses
that
honours
are
empty
and
worthless
to
wear
in
vanity
fair
but
in
vanity
fair
as
we
pass
along
we
meet
strong
hearts
that
are
worth
the
knowing
poor
paste
jewels
that
deck
the
throng
we
see
a
solitaire
sometimes
glowing
we
find
grand
souls
under
robes
of
fashion
light
demeanours
hide
strength
and
passion
and
fair
fine
honour
and
godlike
resistance
in
halls
of
pleasure
may
have
existence
and
we
find
pure
altars
and
shrines
of
prayer
in
vanity
fair
the
giddy
girl
this
recitation
is
intended
to
be
given
with
an
accompaniment
of
waltz
music
introducing
at
the
refrain
with
one
two
three
etc
a
giddy
young
maiden
with
nimble
feet
alack
and
alas
declared
she
would
far
rather
dance
than
eat
and
the
truth
of
it
came
to
pass
for
she
danced
all
day
and
she
danced
all
night
she
danced
till
the
green
earth
faded
white
she
danced
ten
partners
out
of
breath
she
danced
the
eleventh
one
quite
to
death
and
still
she
redowaed
up
and
down
the
giddiest
girl
in
town
with
one
two

kick

whirl
around
quick
the
name
of
this
damsel
ended
with
e
alack
and
and
she
was
as
fair
as
a
maiden
need
be
till
she
danced
her
beauty
away
she
danced
her
big
toes
out
of
joint
she
danced
her
other
toes
all
to
a
point
she
danced
out
slipper
and
boot
and
shoe
she
danced
till
the
bones
of
her
feet
came
through
and
still
she
redowaed
waltzed
and
whirled
the
giddiest
girl
in
the
world
with
one

quick
now
the
end
of
my
story
is
sad
to
relate
and
away
we
go
for
this
beautiful
maiden
final
fate
is
shrouded
in
gloom
and
woe
she
danced
herself
into
a
patent
top
she
whirled
and
whirled
till
she
could
not
stop
she
danced
and
bounded
and
sprang
so
far
that
she
stuck
at
last
on
a
pointed
star
and
there
she
must
dance
till
the
judgment
day
and
after
it
too
for
she
danced
away
her
soul
you
see
so
she
has
no
place
anywhere
out
of
space
with
her

autumn
reverie
we
plucked
a
red
rose
you
and
i
all
in
the
summer
weather
sweet
its
perfume
and
rare
its
bloom
enjoyed
by
us
together
the
rose
is
dead
the
summer
fled
and
bleak
winds
are
complaining
we
dwell
apart
but
in
each
heart
we
find
the
thorn
remaining
we
sipped
a
sweet
wine
you
and
i
all
in
the
summer
weather
the
beaded
draught
we
lightly
quaffed
and
filled
the
glass
together
together
we
watched
its
rosy
glow
and
saw
its
bubbles
glitter
apart
alone
we
only
know
the
lees
are
very
bitter
we
walked
in
sunshine
you
and
i
all
in
the
summer
weather
the
very
night
seemed
noonday
bright
when
we
two
were
together
i
wonder
why
with
our
hill
and
vale
and
meadow
there
fell
such
shade
our
paths
seemed
laid
for
evermore
in
shadow
we
dreamed
a
sweet
dream
you
and
i
all
in
the
summer
weather
where
rose
and
wine
and
warm
sunshine
were
mingled
in
together
we
dreamed
that
june
was
with
us
yet
we
woke
to
find
december
we
dreamed
that
we
two
could
forget
we
woke
but
to
remember
his
youth
dying
i
am
not
dying
are
you
mad
you
think
i
need
to
ask
for
heavenly
grace
think
are
a
fiend
who
would
be
glad
to
see
me
struggle
in
death
cold
embrace
but
man
you
lie
for
i
am
strong
in
truth
stronger
than
i
have
been
in
years
and
soon
i
shall
feel
young
again
as
in
my
youth
my
glorious
youth
life
one
great
priceless
boon
o
youth
youth
youth
o
god
that
golden
time
when
proud
and
glad
i
laughed
the
hours
away
why
there
no
sacrifice
perhaps
no
crime
i
pause
at
could
it
make
me
young
but
i
not
i
grew
just
ill
somehow
grew
stiff
of
limb
and
weak
and
dim
of
sight
it
was
but
sickness
i
am
better
now
oh
vastly
better
ever
since
last
night
and
i
could
weep
warm
floods
of
happy
tears
to
think
my
strength
is
coming
back
at
last
for
i
have
dreamed
of
such
an
hour
for
years
as
i
lay
thinking
of
my
glorious
past
you
shake
your
head
why
man
if
you
were
sane
i
strike
you
to
my
feet
i
would
in
truth
how
dare
you
tell
me
that
my
hopes
are
vain
how
dare
you
say
i
have
outlived
my
youth
heaven
i
may
regain
it
oh
be
still
i
want
no
heaven
but
what
my
glad
youth
gave
its
long
bright
hours
its
rapture
and
its
thrill
o
youth
youth
youth
it
is
my
i
crave
there
is
no
heaven
there
nothing
but
a
deep
and
yawning
grave
from
which
i
shrink
in
fear
i
am
not
sure
of
even
rest
or
sleep
perhaps
we
lie
and
as
i
have
here
think
think
think
think
as
we
lie
there
and
rot
and
hear
the
young
above
us
laugh
in
glee
how
dare
you
say
i
dying
am
i
would
curse
god
if
such
a
thing
could
be
why
see
me
stand
why
hear
this
strong
full
breath
dare
you
repeat
that
silly
base
untruth
a
cry
a
fall
the
silence
known
as
death
hushed
his
wild
words
well
has
he
found
his
youth
under
the
sheet
what
a
terrible
night
does
the
night
i
wonder
the
night
with
her
black
veil
down
to
her
feet
like
an
ordained
nun
know
what
lies
under
that
awful
motionless
sheet
the
winds
seem
crazed
and
wildly
howling
over
the
sad
earth
blindly
go
do
they
and
the
dark
clouds
over
them
scowling
do
they
dream
or
know
why
here
in
the
room
not
a
week
or
over
tho
it
must
be
a
week
not
more
than
one
i
can
not
recken
of
late
or
discover
when
one
day
is
ended
or
one
begun
but
here
in
this
room
we
were
laughing
lightly
and
glad
was
the
measure
our
two
hearts
beat
and
the
royal
face
that
was
smiling
so
brightly
lies
under
that
sheet
i
know
not
why
it
is
strange
and
fearful
but
i
am
afraid
of
her
lying
there
she
who
was
always
so
gay
and
cheerful
lying
so
still
with
that
stony
stare
she
who
was
so
like
some
grand
sultana
fond
of
colour
and
glow
and
heat
to
lie
there
clothed
in
that
awful
manner
in
a
stark
white
sheet
she
who
was
made
out
of
summer
blisses
tropical
beautiful
gracious
fair
to
lie
and
stare
at
my
fondest
kisses
god
no
wonder
it
whitens
my
hair
shriek
o
wind
for
the
world
is
lonely
trail
to
the
nun
night
feet
for
all
that
i
prize
in
life
is
only
a
shape
and
a
sheet
a
pin
oh
i
know
a
certain
woman
who
is
reckoned
with
the
good
but
she
fills
me
with
more
terror
than
a
raging
lion
could
the
little
chills
run
up
and
down
my
spine
we
meet
though
she
seems
a
gentle
creature
and
she
very
trim
and
neat
and
she
has
a
thousand
virtues
and
not
one
acknowledged
sin
but
she
is
the
sort
of
person
you
could
liken
to
a
pin
and
she
pricks
you
and
she
sticks
you
in
a
way
that
ca
be
said
when
you
seek
for
what
has
hurt
you
why
you
can
not
find
the
head
but
she
fills
you
with
discomfort
and
exasperating
pain
if
anybody
asks
you
why
you
really
ca
explain
a
pin
is
such
a
tiny
thing
of
that
there
is
no
doubt
yet
when
it
sticking
in
your
flesh
you
wretched
till
it
out
she
is
wonderfully
observing
when
she
meets
a
pretty
girl
she
is
always
sure
to
tell
her
if
her
bang
is
out
of
curl
and
she
is
so
sympathetic
to
her
friend
who
much
admired
she
is
often
heard
remarking
dear
you
look
so
and
tired
and
she
is
a
careful
critic
for
on
yesterday
she
eyed
the
new
dress
i
was
airing
with
a
woman
natural
pride
and
she
said
oh
how
becoming
and
then
softly
added
it
is
really
a
misfortune
that
the
basque
is
such
a
fit
then
she
said
if
you
had
heard
me
yestereve
i
sure
my
friend
you
would
say
i
am
a
champion
who
knows
how
to
defend
and
she
left
me
with
a
feeling
most
unpleasant
i
aver
that
the
whole
world
would
despise
me
if
it
had
been
for
her
whenever
i
encounter
her
in
such
a
nameless
way
she
gives
me
the
impression
i
am
at
my
worst
that
day
and
the
hat
that
was
imported
and
that
cost
me
half
a
sonnet
with
just
one
glance
from
her
round
eyes
becomes
a
bowery
bonnet
she
is
always
bright
and
smiling
sharp
and
shining
for
a
thrust
use
does
not
seem
to
blunt
her
point
nor
does
she
gather
rust
oh
i
wish
some
hapless
specimen
of
mankind
would
begin
to
tidy
up
the
world
for
me
by
picking
up
this
pin
the
coming
man
oh
not
for
the
great
departed
who
formed
our
country
laws
and
not
for
the
who
died
in
freedom
cause
and
not
for
some
living
hero
to
whom
all
bend
the
knee
my
muse
would
raise
her
song
of
praise
but
for
the
man
for
out
of
the
strife
which
woman
is
passing
through
a
man
that
is
more
than
human
shall
yet
be
born
i
say
a
man
in
whose
pure
spirit
no
dross
of
self
will
lurk
a
man
who
is
strong
to
cope
with
wrong
a
man
who
is
proud
to
work
a
man
with
hope
undaunted
a
man
with
godlike
power
shall
come
when
he
most
is
wanted
shall
come
at
the
needed
hour
he
shall
silence
the
din
and
clamour
of
clan
disputing
with
clan
and
toil
long
fight
with
might
shall
triumph
through
this
man
i
know
he
is
coming
coming
to
help
to
guide
to
save
though
i
hear
no
martial
drumming
and
see
no
flags
that
wave
but
the
great
soul
travail
of
woman
and
the
bold
free
thought
unfurled
are
heralds
that
say
he
is
on
the
way
the
coming
man
of
the
world
mourn
not
for
vanished
ages
with
their
great
heroic
men
who
dwell
in
history
pages
and
live
in
the
poet
pen
for
the
grandest
times
are
before
us
and
the
world
is
yet
to
see
the
noblest
worth
of
this
old
earth
in
the
men
that
are
to
be
