how
she
felt
in
her
first
corset
it
occurred
at
belgrade
where
the
genial
tom
quaw
gave
a
party
the
first
that
the
town
ever
saw
the
youth
and
the
beauty
the
tillers
of
soil
attended
that
night
seeking
surcease
from
toil
there
were
farmers
whose
hair
had
a
tinge
of
the
gray
there
were
maidens
than
whom
none
were
ever
more
gay
there
were
youths
who
could
ride
anything
that
wears
hair
and
matrons
whose
faces
showed
lines
of
dull
care
of
the
ladies
who
on
this
occasion
took
part
some
were
dressed
in
the
nobbiest
style
of
the
art
and
the
others
unmindful
of
fashion
decrees
were
attired
to
have
much
more
comfort
and
ease
there
was
one
blushing
damsel
just
budding
sixteen
whose
waist
by
a
corset
encircled
had
been
but
whose
mother
insisted
that
on
such
a
night
one
should
find
a
place
there
and
the
lacing
be
tight
so
the
girl
was
rigged
out
as
the
mother
desired
but
of
dancing
was
noticed
the
damsel
soon
tired
what
the
matter
was
asked
by
some
one
at
her
side
i
feel
just
like
bucking
the
maiden
replied
a
lover
valentine
sweetheart
of
mine
a
valentine
in
duty
bound
i
send
thee
and
wish
that
joy
free
from
alloy
may
evermore
attend
thee
near
or
apart
still
may
thy
heart
to
mine
in
friendship
nestle
for
strong
and
free
in
love
for
thee
countless
foes
i
wrestle
since
i
am
thine
pray
do
be
mine
my
heart
prompts
me
to
ask
thee
thy
charming
face
and
matchless
grace
i
own
have
quite
possessed
me
to
those
who
hold
the
guiding
reins
i
have
observed
a
steed
lashed
by
a
cruel
driver
till
the
sweat
stood
out
in
beaded
drops
upon
his
side
and
oftimes
tears
have
welled
up
in
my
eyes
as
in
my
mind
i
pictured
human
hearts
lashed
thus
by
cruel
words
and
goaded
on
then
when
at
other
times
the
same
proud
steed
has
passed
along
the
street
with
arched
neck
with
every
motion
breathing
force
and
vim
i
noticed
kindness
held
the
guiding
reins
and
kept
in
check
the
zealous
prancer
power
my
mind
has
pictured
then
with
kindlier
glow
a
heart
ambitious
far
too
keen
to
go
kept
by
sweet
loving
words
in
proper
bounds
and
deepest
gratitude
at
such
a
time
wells
up
for
those
who
hold
the
guiding
reins
his
face
is
his
fortune
his
face
is
his
fortune
yes
seldom
we
see
one
for
tick
importune
as
boldly
as
he
like
one
who
has
riches
acquired
by
gift
he
laughs
at
the
stitches
of
gainer
by
thrift
for
face
is
his
treasure
and
why
keep
in
bank
one
can
not
find
pleasure
with
lank
so
credit
he
uses
it
will
pass
and
always
abuses
the
laboring
class
but
cheek
is
like
iron
that
coated
with
tin
it
has
a
nice
face
on
but
one
rather
thin
a
love
letter
and
its
answer
a
montanian
to
his
sweetheart
darling
i
love
thee
other
words
might
tell
a
trifle
of
how
dear
thou
art
to
me
but
these
tell
all
of
thee
i
might
have
said
and
said
in
truth
at
that
that
all
thy
ways
thine
every
motion
look
and
glance
as
well
did
charm
the
inmost
recess
of
my
soul
in
words
of
praise
and
those
in
justice
due
i
might
the
beauties
of
thy
mind
portray
for
they
outrival
charms
that
in
thy
face
i
see
as
elsewhere
i
have
failed
to
find
thy
modesty
thy
grace
thy
love
of
all
that
tends
to
elevate
to
purify
and
make
a
fellow
mortal
happier
i
might
have
dwelt
on
to
a
length
that
thou
and
thou
alone
deserves
from
one
whose
pen
is
feeble
in
thy
praise
as
is
mine
own
still
had
i
done
so
and
withheld
the
words
i
love
thee
i
had
never
told
thee
half
i
love
thee
darling
ah
indeed
i
do
beyond
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
i
love
and
such
a
one
as
any
prince
or
king
might
gladly
love
and
proudly
call
his
own
but
come
to
think
this
love
is
all
i
have
no
titled
rank
is
mine
no
astor
wealth
and
one
you
know
ca
live
on
love
alone
ah
no
but
better
starve
for
lack
of
bread
than
want
of
love
for
when
we
starve
for
bread
and
hunger
knaws
with
all
its
force
a
day
and
all
desire
for
food
grows
weak
and
in
its
stead
one
craves
but
rest
and
sleep
these
come
and
few
the
days
ere
dreamless
sleep
supplies
the
place
of
all
desires
and
pains
but
starve
for
love
and
when
doth
come
relief
the
weary
soul
still
lives
or
drags
along
as
doomed
for
life
goes
to
his
work
ambitionless
it
moves
its
purpose
dead
yet
like
powerless
to
go
struggling
hope
and
fear
as
thro
the
bars
a
gleam
of
sunshine
flitters
now
and
then
the
while
it
shines
to
leave
more
dark
the
gloomy
dungeon
of
an
unloved
life
moving
as
moves
the
lifeless
rock
or
ore
when
those
with
life
exert
it
their
power
living
ah
yes
but
devil
never
cursed
his
vilest
victim
with
a
death
so
dread
standing
as
stands
an
engine
on
the
track
perfectly
built
in
all
its
mighty
parts
its
boiler
and
its
furnace
amply
fed
yet
powerless
but
let
the
flame
of
love
touch
but
one
splinter
of
the
waiting
pyre
and
all
is
changed
in
gladsome
bounds
the
blaze
leaps
on
and
on
till
burning
with
one
flame
the
fire
warms
the
soul
to
life
warms
till
as
love
directs
its
living
proves
when
under
wisdom
hands
man
highest
bliss
yes
when
love
fills
the
heart
behold
how
strong
how
powerful
one
stands
his
muscles
ache
with
pure
strength
and
long
for
that
on
which
their
latent
power
to
show
and
not
alone
in
idle
longings
doth
a
lover
stand
but
works
alike
with
both
his
head
and
hands
to
gain
desired
ends
doth
one
lack
means
then
love
supplies
a
purpose
and
desire
and
rests
not
still
till
they
are
at
command
doth
one
feel
weak
then
love
doth
make
him
strong
is
one
a
slave
to
appetite
or
care
then
love
doth
free
him
from
the
galling
chains
doth
one
lack
knowledge
or
attainments
rare
then
love
spurs
on
till
all
of
these
are
gained
yes
love
and
that
alone
is
all
i
have
but
darling
having
that
i
offer
thee
more
than
all
else
another
man
can
give
who
hath
abundance
and
is
rich
in
all
save
love
and
that
for
thee
and
thee
alone
this
is
my
plea
i
stand
and
wait
my
fate
if
thou
dost
love
me
darling
tell
me
so
if
not
but
that
can
never
be
i
know
the
answer
she
gave
him
your
note
to
me
of
recent
date
where
you
are
so
importunate
has
been
received
and
i
have
read
with
greatest
care
what
you
have
said
i
am
quite
pleased
that
you
can
see
so
much
to
praise
in
one
like
me
and
only
wish
that
i
could
say
nice
things
in
such
a
pretty
way
but
tell
me
do
you
really
think
that
love
is
better
than
the
chink
why
money
rules
the
world
with
strong
and
unresistless
sway
is
little
schoolboys
talk
of
love
but
as
they
older
grow
improve
while
girls
though
they
be
very
young
know
better
but
may
hold
their
tongue
if
you
have
money
then
you
can
go
where
you
will
and
be
a
man
but
if
you
poor
a
genius
too
your
family
can
be
but
blue
while
oft
you
wish
for
food
to
eat
and
for
firm
friends
your
heart
to
greet
you
own
you
poor
yet
ask
of
me
to
share
a
poor
man
misery
why
men
would
be
real
scarce
indeed
ere
i
should
think
to
feel
the
need
of
one
who
nothing
has
but
love
poor
men
abound
we
rove
and
i
can
get
one
any
day
when
rich
pray
call
around
this
way
suppose
we
loved
and
married
were
and
fortune
gave
to
us
an
heir
pray
who
would
nurse
and
care
for
it
who
train
its
mind
who
mould
its
wit
who
wash
the
dishes
cook
the
food
do
chores
and
cut
the
wood
what
buggy
rides
would
i
receive
how
many
friends
would
to
me
cleave
and
then
there
concerts
to
attend
and
other
places
that
transcend
the
theaters
and
balls
that
now
we
with
unstinted
praise
endow
oh
no
do
ask
of
me
to
wed
a
loving
fellow
though
his
head
be
better
filled
with
brains
than
those
who
dress
themselves
in
finer
clothes
i
want
a
man
who
rich
in
stocks
d
think
i
ever
darn
old
socks
you
talk
of
love
and
lovers
bold
as
though
i
care
if
icy
cold
were
heart
of
him
to
whom
with
pride
my
loving
heart
i
fondly
tied
i
would
be
rich
and
nothing
care
for
i
have
lover
everywhere
and
when
of
one
i
tired
grew
i
take
my
pick
and
love
anew
now
do
be
angry
with
me
pray
for
what
i
written
you
you
were
to
me
so
frank
and
true
i
could
not
well
be
less
to
you
so
i
have
said
what
all
must
feel
though
some
i
know
the
facts
conceal
then
do
not
seek
just
now
to
wed
but
wait
until
you
rich
instead
the
baby
clothes
let
poets
praise
as
in
days
gone
by
the
wealth
of
a
loving
maiden
sigh
the
bliss
ecstatic
of
every
bride
and
honeymoon
pleasures
that
subside
i
sing
of
a
happier
time
than
those
the
time
when
making
the
baby
clothes
a
girlish
heart
may
with
joy
when
with
the
one
she
would
call
her
boy
and
a
doting
wife
may
fail
to
cloy
a
heart
kept
free
from
every
alloy
but
joys
surpassing
the
sweetest
of
those
come
when
preparing
the
baby
clothes
a
sister
love
they
say
that
the
angels
look
down
from
above
and
watch
us
wherever
we
stray
that
they
are
the
beings
that
guide
us
in
love
and
bring
us
the
joys
of
the
day
i
am
glad
it
is
so
and
thank
them
for
the
wealth
of
a
sister
love
for
of
all
the
pleasures
they
bring
to
as
here
that
nearest
the
joys
above
i
felt
so
real
often
as
in
my
arms
i
clasped
her
form
and
kissed
her
but
the
girl
that
i
kissed
was
not
my
own
she
was
another
fellow
sister
a
story
i
was
a
teacher
then
as
now
and
made
a
little
spending
money
by
training
big
and
little
sprouts
in
a
mining
town
called
pony
one
night
the
biggest
boy
i
had
for
having
cracked
a
rigid
rule
was
bade
to
stay
and
con
his
books
some
fifteen
minutes
after
school
i
for
a
moment
turned
my
back
on
other
duties
then
intent
the
fellow
slyly
raised
a
sash
and
through
the
opening
quickly
went
next
eve
as
extra
punishment
i
gave
him
minutes
and
lest
he
play
the
prank
again
i
kept
my
every
sense
alive
the
task
performed
he
left
the
room
the
sun
was
shining
then
no
more
and
when
soon
afterwards
i
left
i
found
him
waiting
at
the
door
is
getting
late
the
youth
remarked
for
ladies
to
be
out
alone
and
may
i
have
the
pleasure
miss
of
seeing
that
you
safely
home
i
smiled
and
took
the
gallant
arm
what
else
could
anybody
do
i
liked
the
fellow
ever
since
and
have
no
doubt
he
likes
me
too
true
love
ask
of
the
winds
that
all
around
in
saddest
requiem
blow
wherein
and
where
alone
is
found
true
happiness
below
and
when
in
love
their
answer
is
would
you
love
secret
know
consider
both
have
equal
rights
and
treat
each
other
so
thus
sang
a
poet
months
ago
as
the
world
he
roamed
and
saw
the
home
of
dearest
friends
to
desolation
doomed
a
home
where
years
before
the
bride
with
heart
of
joy
and
glee
had
welcomed
to
her
heart
embrace
a
bud
of
misery
a
bud
of
misery
you
say
yes
thinking
it
a
rose
and
little
dreaming
that
its
folds
no
fragrance
did
enclose
but
so
the
after
years
have
shown
and
blighted
hearts
are
found
where
once
affection
reigned
supreme
and
spread
its
joys
around
he
loved
her
but
he
never
thought
that
love
should
be
expressed
and
slights
that
caused
her
keenest
pain
he
never
once
redressed
to
me
he
often
wished
he
been
to
her
a
better
man
but
urged
to
tell
his
wife
as
much
he
would
not
brook
the
plan
oh
ye
on
whom
some
heart
depends
for
all
its
store
of
bliss
withhold
not
from
that
tender
soul
the
loving
word
and
kiss
but
give
expression
to
your
love
and
make
its
bliss
complete
by
giving
those
within
your
home
unfettered
love
to
greet
we
grown
apart
in
all
these
years
we
were
firm
friends
in
years
gone
by
were
classmates
at
the
school
and
kept
each
other
company
against
the
master
rule
for
he
was
righteous
and
he
taught
no
boys
with
girls
shall
play
i
wonder
if
he
really
thought
they
lead
us
all
astray
no
messages
shall
pass
between
the
scholars
in
this
school
and
woe
to
him
who
first
is
seen
to
violate
this
rule
by
fear
and
awe
were
all
oppressed
and
knew
not
what
to
do
but
i
more
bold
than
all
the
rest
sent
kate
my
she
answered
them
and
sweeter
notes
a
lover
never
read
i
often
wondered
since
that
time
they
never
turned
my
head
and
when
our
daily
tasks
were
away
from
school
we
ran
to
meet
within
some
leafy
dell
and
both
our
futures
plan
but
now
she
meets
me
with
reserve
no
welcome
as
of
yore
no
parting
with
a
warm
embrace
no
kisses
at
the
door
another
fellow
charms
her
now
she
children
pert
and
tripper
and
many
a
time
upon
her
knee
she
spanks

a
youth
not
handsome
from
an
outward
view
whose
features
stern
belied
the
mellowness
that
dwelt
behind
his
earnest
steadfast
look
delved
in
his
heart
upon
a
summer
day
and
found
therein
a
narrow
vein
of
love
the
prospect
pleased
and
on
development
he
found
the
mine
was
rich
for
years
he
worked
and
piled
in
heaps
the
ore
upon

his
heart
he
branched
out

silvered

found
almost
exhaustless
hidden

he
sought
association
and
he
found
a
friend
who
brought
the
skill
to
treat
the
ore
he
wasted
not
the
wealth
by
labor
won
but
when
refined
he
stored
the
bricks
away
until
within
himself
there
was
no

was
