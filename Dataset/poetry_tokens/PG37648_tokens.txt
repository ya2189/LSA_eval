a

of
emblems
to
the
memory
of
charles
douglas
marquis
of
northampton
this
little
book
mainly
due
in
its
present
form
to
his
generosity
and
counsel
is
dedicated
in
all
grateful
and
tender
recollection
by
the
author
illustration
preface
this
small
volume
is
the
latest
of
above
three
thousand
of
a
similar
kind
which
under
the
general
title
of
books
of
emblems
have
followed
in
the
wake
of
the
a
work
much
resembling
a
child
primer
in
outward
appearance
published
at
augsburg
in
and
composed
by
andrea
alciati
a
famous
lawyer
antiquary
and
litterateur
of
milan
this
book
consisted
of
nearly
a
hundred
latin
epigrams
some
original
some
translated
or
paraphrased
from
the
greek
and
each
accompanied
by
a
rude
woodcut
illustration
alciati
was
the
first
author
who
gave
the
name
of
emblem
to
this
form
of
expressing
his
ideas
and
the
notion
for
so
doing
was
suggested
by
the
original
meaning
of
the
word
emblem
which
signifies
anything
inserted
the
greeks
and
romans
used
to
insert
small
pictures
or
in
the
sides
of
vases
and
various
other
utensils
these
little
works
of
art
were
called
emblems
they
were
sometimes
accompanied
by
mottoes
or
verses
and
often
made
removable
at
pleasure
so
that
they
formed
no
necessary
part
of
the
article
which
they
adorned
alciati
therefore
considering
that
the
illustrations
formed
no
necessary
portion
of
his
book
and
that
they
were
only
inserted
as
he
says
himself
to
make
his
moral
and
philosophical
teaching
more
attractive
gave
to
his
collection
of
poems
and
pictures
the
name
of
book
of
emblems
this
idea
took
greatly
with
the
public
of
his
day
and
for
upwards
of
two
hundred
years
afterwards
and
generated
a
class
of
books
now
reckoned
among
the
fossils
of
literature
which
may
be
dug
out
of
ancient
libraries
or
procured
by
chance
here
and
there
through
the
agency
of
those
useful
purveyors
the
publishers
of
catalogues
of
works
now
emblem
books
have
had
their
day
and
are
no
longer
regarded
as
a
means
of
instruction
or
delight
they
have
done
their
duty
as
ornamental
wits
and
lively
educators
and
now
make
way
for
others
more
suited
to
the
age
there
will
be
found
very
few
theological
teachers
of
our
day
who
would
like
sebastian
stockhamer
not
only
advise
a
patron
to
have
the
emblems
of
alciati
always
at
hand
at
home
and
abroad
but
suggest
that
he
should
do
as
alexander
did
with
the
works
of
homer
sleep
with
them
under
his
pillow
he
therefore
who
ventures
to
put
forth
his
own
conceits
clothed
in
this
dress
before
the
present
world
of
critical
thinkers
and
impatient
novel
readers
must
apologise
for
his
intrusion
and
crave
indulgence
some
perhaps
who
may
look
into
these
pages
will
sympathise
with
the
author
in
the
pleasure
he
has
enjoyed
in
following
the
footsteps
of
the
ingenious
emblematists
of
old
and
will
accept
the
subjoined
emblem
as
an
illustration
of
their
common
feeling
upon
the
subject
though
the
new
be
gold
some
love
the
old
they
have
wrecked
the
old
farm
with
its
chimneys
so
high
and
white
flashing
gables
my
childhood
delight
the
old
home
is
gone
and
the
sorrowing
eye
shuns
the
upstart
that
glares
from
its
site
so
flowed
my
fresh
feeling
when
loud
at
my
side
rose
the
voice
of
a
stranger
arresting
the
tide
what
an
emblem
is
here
of
the
glories
of
change
which
purges
and
pares
the
old
world
to
its
quick
transforming
that
and
ricketty
grange
with
its
plaster
and
laths
to
a
mansion
of
brick
the
prose
chilled
like
ice
i
sank
into
my
skin
and
felt
my
poor
sentiment
almost
a
sin
the
author
thinks
it
necessary
to
say
that
circumstances
over
which
he
had
no
control
prevented
him
from
carrying
out
his
original
idea
which
was
that
every
set
of
verses
should
be
accompanied
by
an
illustration
and
it
is
only
by
the
assistance
of
many
friends
to
whom
his
best
acknowledgments
are
due
that
he
has
been
able
to
provide
the
comparatively
few
accompanying
woodcuts
footnotes

preface
to
andrea
alciati

book

states
