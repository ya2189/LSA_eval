certain

verses

in

gypsy
verses
you
were
not
so
idle
you
wore
a
sprig
of
green
you
wore
a
feather
in
your
cap
the
reddest
ever
face
was
laughing
gypsy
brown
your
eyes
were
of
the
blue
you
wandered
up
and
down
the
world
for
you
had
much
to
oh
you
were
not
idle
whatever
men
might
say
you
made
the
colour
of
the
year
magnificent
and
atarah
with
painted
slender
folded
hands
she
waited
what
might
come
her
head
was
tyred
with
jewelled
bands
her
mouth
was
sweet
and
dumb
her
cymar
was
of
ardassine
fire
red
from
throat
to
hem
broidered
with
turkis
stones
therein
she
gave
her
soul
for
them
faint
cassia
and
myrrh
made
perilous
her
hair
and
what
was
woe
to
her
whose
face
was
despair
nor
life
nor
love
from
those
cold
lips
but
ah
in
what
degree
her
passionate
lover
leans
and
sips
her
poesy
age
blindness
and
women
wailing
on
white
seas
seas
where
no
placid
sails
have
ever
been
dreams
like
wan
demons
on
waste
marshes
seen
dulling
fevered
eyes
the
dregs
and
lees
of
wine
long
spilt
to
dead
divinities
grey
empty
days
when
spring
is
never
green
can
the
heart
answer
what
these
riddles
mean
can
the
life
hold
such
hopelessness
as
these
love
lying
low
in
the
long
pleasant
grass
youth
with
his
eager
face
against
the
sun
they
may
not
guess
the
hours
when
these
shall
pass
in
what
drear
coin
such
lovely
dreams
are
paid
at
what
grim
cost
their
flowery
days
are
won
when
man
is
old
and
lonely
and
afraid
love
and
dawn
dawn
shaking
long
light
pennons
in
the
east
is
love
the
least
and
love
the
greatest
of
the
woes
see
how
the
rose
breaks
in
a
hundred
petals
down
the
sky
darkness
must
die
and
in
the
heart
where
flutters
sad
desire
wakes
the
new
fire
silver
and
azure
of
the
open
day
so
grief
away
we
will
be
glad
with
flagons
drown
old
pain
and
dawn
shall
bring
us
to
her
own
again
ambigueux
you
are
the
dreams
we
do
not
dare
to
dream
the
dim
florescence
of
a
mystic
rose
in
poverty
or
pride
love
comes
and
goes
we
do
not
question
what
the
deeps
may
seem
launched
on
the
steady
current
of
the
stream
gaily
and
hardily
we
hear
the
prose
in
youth
red
sun
in
age
the
charnel
snows
nor
see
the
banks
where
subtle
flowers
gleam
in
green
sweet
beds
of
moly
and
of
thyme
wild
as
an
errant
fancy
all
the
while
we
know
you
mystic
rose
we
know
your
smile
your
deep
still
eyes
your
fragrant
floating
hair
the
peacock
purple
of
the
gown
you
wear
o
lyric
alchemist
of
rune
and
rhyme
sapphics
leave
the
vine
ah
love
and
the
wreath
of
myrtle
leave
the
song
to
die
on
the
lips
of
laughter
come
for
love
is
faint
with
the
choric
measure
weary
of
waiting
down
the
sky
in
lines
of
pellucid
amber
blows
the
hair
of
her
whom
the
gods
have
treasured
fair
more
fair
is
mine
in
the
ring
of
maidens
mine
for
the
taking
satan
prince
of
darkness
i
sinned
but
gloriously
i
bore
the
fall
from
high
places
as
becomes
a
king
i
did
not
shrink
before
the
utmost
sting
of
torture
or
of
banishment
the
pall
of
dis
i
cried
should
be
the
hall
where
sad
proud
men
of
men
should
meet
and
sing
the
woes
of
that
defeat
ambitions
bring
hurled
from
the
last
vain
fight
against
the
wall
i
thought
i
had
been
punished
to
forego
all
lovely
sights
the
whisper
of
fresh
rain
to
brood
forever
endlessly
on
pain
yet
still
a
prince
ah
god
i
dreamed
and
then
i
learned
my
fate
this
wandering
to
and
fro
in
work
among
the
sons
of
men
in
prison
above
her
task
the
long
year
through
she
works
with
steady
hands
the
while
her
heart
is
tired
with
dreams
which
no
man
understands
for
long
and
long
ago
she
knew
green
trees
and
open
sky
before
the
law
condemned
her
days
to
doom
until
she
die
and
so
she
dreams
in
mystic
peace
indifferent
to
the
scene
because
her
heart
retains
and
knows
the
little
stain
of
green
ghosts
the
long
lost
lights
of
love
i
know
they
thrill
from
ultimate
space
they
blow
like
small
bewildered
stars
tossed
high
on
some
unknown
and
passionate
sky
i
know
them
for
the
loved
lost
lights
that
made
the
glamour
of
my
nights
long
long
ago
and
now
i
fear
their
coming
and
the
garb
they
wear
for
they
are
very
white
and
cold
they
are
not
coloured
as
of
old
in
trailing
radiance
rose
and
red
for
these
are
ghosts
and
they
are
dead
lilis
we
have
forgiven
you
because
you
are
so
fair
eloquent
by
virtue
of
your
dark
enchanting
eyes
evil
to
your
heart
of
hearts
shall
we
blame
or
care
you
are
very
beautiful
and
love
has
made
you
wise
with
a
splendid
insolence
you
exist
to
sin
scorn
us
for
the
weaknesses
that
bring
us
to
our
pain
weak
you
are
and
false
you
are
and
never
may
we
win
yet
we
have
forgiven
you
and
shall
forgive
again
the
old
women
we
are
very
very
old
we
have
had
our
day
so
we
bend
above
our
work
while
the
others
play
do
they
call
us
women
we
gaunt
and
grey
and
grim
hideous
and
sexless
things
weak
of
brain
and
limb
beauty
ended
love
long
past
yet
when
all
else
flees
we
are
women
for
we
still
have
our
memories
to
hippolytus
it
is
too
late
to
part
i
dreamed
a
dream
that
love
had
loosed
me
that
no
more
your
name
should
vex
my
soul
for
very
pride
and
shame
i
hid
you
out
of
mind
i
said
the
stream
has
grown
too
wide
between
us
it
would
seem
to
sunder
even
memory
your
fame
rang
hollow
on
my
ear
and
then
you
came
and
love
laughed
for
the
lie
he
would
redeem
it
is
too
late
love
will
not
let
me
go
the
bare
suns
burn
me
and
the
strong
winds
blow
i
take
them
fearlessly
for
i
am
wise
at
last
for
being
yours
i
must
be
brave
you
give
nothing
still
am
i
your
slave
the
light
within
my
heart
your
eyes
your
eyes
the
garden
hedge
i
live
in
a
beautiful
garden
all
joyous
with
fountains
and
flowers
i
reck
not
of
penance
or
pardon
at
ease
the
exquisite
hours
my
blossoms
of
lilies
and
pansies
pale
heliotrope
rosemary
rue
all
lull
me
with
delicate
fancies
as
shy
as
the
dawn
and
the
dew
but
the
ghost
gods
the
ghost
in
the
gloaming
how
it
lures
me
with
whispers
and
cries
how
it
speaks
of
the
wind
and
the
roaming
free
free
the
romany
skies
the
hedge
that
is
crimson
with
roses
all
wonderfully
crimson
and
gold
and
caged
in
my
beautiful
closes
i
know
what
it
is
to
be
old
the
slave
woman
her
eyes
are
dark
with
unknown
deeps
old
woes
and
new
despair
her
shackled
spirit
feels
the
thong
that
breaks
her
body
bare
the
savage
master
of
her
days
who
mocks
her
passive
pain
how
should
he
know
her
scorn
of
him
indifferent
to
the
stain
for
in
her
heart
she
sees
the
glow
of
sacrificial
fires
a
priestess
of
a
mystic
rite
performed
on
nameless
pyres
the
incident
of
shame
and
toil
she
takes
with
idle
breath
for
she
remembers
africa
and
what
to
her
is
death
song
the
sky
is
more
blue
than
the
eyes
of
a
boy
a
riot
of
roses
entangles
the
year
ah
come
to
me
run
to
me
fill
me
with
joy
dear
dear
dear
the
air
is
a
passion
of
perfume
and
song
the
little
moon
swings
up
above
look
above
i
can
not
wait
longer
waited
so
long
love
love
love
hide
your
eyes
angels
beneath
your
gold
phylacteries
israfel
will
charm
you
with
the
magic
of
his
song
yet
you
will
not
smile
for
him
by
reason
of
your
memories
for
lucifer
is
absent
and
the
cry
goes
up
how
long
for
his
expiation
you
would
give
your
dreams
and
destinies
paradise
is
clouded
by
the
measure
of
your
pain
hide
your
eyes
angels
beneath
your
gold
phylacteries
till
the
jasper
gates
swing
wide
to
bring
him
home
again
out
of
the
jungle
out
of
the
jungle
he
came
he
came
man
of
the
breed
his
heart
was
fire
and
his
eyes
were
flame
and
he
piped
on
a
singing
reed
spring
was
sweet
and
keen
in
his
blood
singing
he
sought
his
mate
the
wife
for
the
life
and
time
of
his
mood
formed
for
his
needs
by
fate
over
his
reed
he
piped
and
sang
his
eyes
were
the
eyes
of
a
man
but
the
jungle
knew
how
his
changes
rang
for
his
heart
was
the
heart
of
pan
in
port
wave
buffeted
and
sick
with
storm
the
ships
came
reeling
in
the
harbour
lights
were
kind
and
warm
and
yet
so
hard
to
win
like
wings
the
tired
sails
fluttered
down
while
night
began
to
fall
then
came
toward
the
town
the
smallest
ship
of
all
at
last
in
harbour
safe
and
still
no
more
she
need
be
brave
no
more
meet
the
rough
will
the
wanton
of
each
wave
the
harbour
lights
but
where
the
moon
should
murmur
blessings
bright
clouded
instead
the
dread
typhoon
that
thundered
down
the
night
what
curse
the
luring
harbour
bore
of
false
security
the
port
held
desolation
more
than
boasted
all
the
sea
when
morning
came
with
leering
lip
what
death
lay
on
her
breast
and
oh
the
little
weary
ship
was
wrecked
with
all
the
rest
sonny
boy
a
bust
by
grave
as
a
little
god
erect
and
wise
he
dares
the
years
that
open
to
his
gaze
brave
in
his
charming
beauty
he
portrays
a
bright
eternal
youth
and
in
his
eyes
sweet
moons
that
are
no
more
no
sad
surprise
has
gloomed
the
gay
adventure
of
his
ways
and
from
the
meadow
of
the
days
he
leaps
to
enterprise
sunrise
there
was
a
cry
from
the
sky
a
cry
at
night
it
wakened
the
breeze
in
the
trees
when
the
moon
was
white
and
i
only
i
adrift
on
terrible
seas
read
the
cry
aright
pennants
of
gold
were
unrolled
they
told
of
sun
pain
with
the
dark
and
the
rain
was
over
and
done
the
travail
of
old
had
passed
from
the
mother
again
and
the
fight
was
won
there
was
a
cry
from
the
sky
and
my
soul
was
torn
with
a
passion
divine
as
of
wine
from
the
breast
of
morn
for
i
only
i
knew
the
cry
as
the
signal
and
sign
that
love
was
born
dead
ladies
thais
and
lalage
your
eyes
are
closed
phryne
aholibah
your
lips
are
dust
your
tinkling
feet
are
idle
and
composed
all
your
gold
beauty
vanished
into
rust
nor
dionysian
mysteries
taught
you
this
since
the
gold
serpent
was
your
seal
and
sign
deathless
be
the
imprint
of
your
kiss
the
lips
that
redden
are
not
yours
but
mine
how
you
would
scorn
us
lalage
the
lure
of
your
mad
moments
us
the
motley
crew
yet
shall
your
beauty
only
so
endure
imperishable
that
we
sing
of
you
when
tristan
sailed
when
tristan
sailed
from
ireland
across
the
summer
sea
how
young
he
was
how
debonnaire
how
glad
he
was
and
free
why
should
he
know
the
gales
would
blow
the
skies
be
black
above
how
should
he
dream
his
port
was
death
and
doom
whose
name
is
love
the
lady
iseult
sweet
as
prayer
we
hardly
dare
to
pray
beneath
her
shadow
hair
grows
fairer
day
by
day
the
ichor
gains
her
veins
her
skies
the
eyes
of
youth
how
should
she
dream
the
ichor
love
was
hellebore
in
truth
so
tristan
sailed
from
ireland
as
youth
must
always
sail
he
quaffed
the
cup
nor
asked
the
wine
he
dared
nor
feared
to
fail
and
be
it
poison
be
it
life
or
wrecks
that
strew
the
shore
tristan
set
forth
nor
ask
the
end
else
youth
shall
sail
no
more
the
battle
ah
never
never
never
for
the
flag
is
twined
about
my
body
and
my
back
is
braced
against
the
wall
i
know
the
lack
of
crust
and
water
and
a
man
might
brag
for
fighting
thus
yet
how
a
soul
may
lag
for
want
of
just
so
little
when
the
rack
of
hopeless
strife
from
dawn
to
bivouac
finds
the
foe
now
who
storms
the
utmost
crag
never
surrender
you
who
storm
my
heart
till
i
am
faint
with
love
and
hunger
all
starved
for
your
lips
how
can
i
say
and
yet
drag
up
the
sword
again
and
thrust
ah
love
mine
enemy
i
will
not
fall
until
my
flag
and
i
are
dust
recompense
those
who
ask
for
a
star
often
receive
but
a
stone
yet
they
asked
for
a
star
does
the
high
thought
not
atone
i
who
asked
but
a
stone
a
plaything
of
azure
or
red
may
i
count
it
for
gain
that
i
won
a
star
instead
the
lotus
eaters
we
have
no
rain
we
have
no
sun
we
only
watch
the
moments
run
like
little
adders
the
leaves
lost
ere
their
flitting
has
begun
the
cool
light
airs
that
fan
our
brow
what
aromatic
sweets
they
know
the
tall
tired
trees
that
make
our
sky
are
lapped
in
spices
as
they
bow
the
flowers
that
form
our
bed
like
eager
jewels
blue
and
red
seem
brimmed
with
gay
immortal
life
yet
we
dream
on
when
they
are
dead
lost
aphrodite
the
gods
upon
the
hills
no
more
are
seen
couched
on
the
virginal
green
no
more
their
cry
upon
the
silence
grieves
the
shadow
of
dark
leaves
the
blazonry
of
spring
must
now
abate
without
the
purple
state
of
aphrodite
amorous
and
frail
cinctured
with
lilies
pale
she
who
was
love
and
every
desire
now
only
can
inspire
the
mutual
love
of
mortals
and
alone
like
wind
her
plaints
are
blown
about
the
unregarding
world
her
hands
yearn
forth
across
the
lands
once
passionate
with
her
lovers
but
in
vain
they
will
not
come
again
she
who
was
aphrodite
she
gives
love
to
each
heart
that
lives
gives
and
receives
not
she
of
love
the
breath
doomed
now
with
utter
death
the
fools
on
the
wrist
a
paroquet
motley
on
the
shoulder
we
exist
for
joy
of
life
never
growing
older
dancing
down
the
lane
of
years
rosy
garlands
trailing
who
would
pause
for
time
or
tears
barren
days
bewailing
brighter
burden
never
were
than
the
smiles
we
scatter
loving
deeds
and
laughing
love
this
is
our
great
matter
and
the
wise
who
scorn
our
bells
mate
with
melancholy
we
are
wiser
than
the
wise
holding
hands
with
folly
the
awakening
perhaps
the
world
is
tired
of
pageantries
and
all
the
weary
women
called
the
hours
jaded
with
jewels
shall
exchange
for
flowers
their
badge
of
pride
in
violet
harmonies
with
sweet
blue
veils
of
silence
their
eyes
they
shall
return
to
most
languorous
bowers
and
light
and
beauty
shall
come
down
as
showers
releasing
life
from
all
its
pedantries
only
the
bloomy
purple
hill
to
see
lids
and
only
to
be
blind
with
asphodils
shall
these
things
ever
be
surely
the
time
is
ripe
to
live
for
this
dawn
springing
radiant
from
her
sleep
to
find
a
world
of
lovers
waiting
for
her
kiss
the
dark
woman
my
dark
wild
woman
of
the
braes
i
know
your
heart
i
know
your
ways
i
know
the
raw
sweet
food
you
taste
i
love
the
colours
your
waist
ribbons
of
green
and
gold
you
wear
threaded
about
your
shadowy
hair
my
colours
and
your
eyes
are
mine
dark
as
the
deeps
of
love
and
wine
i
wake
with
you
at
budding
dawn
leaving
this
life
of
lawn
to
join
your
spirit
in
the
wild
your
brother
lover
or
your
child
take
me
upon
your
savage
breast
teach
me
your
calms
and
your
unrest
take
me
i
know
the
jungle
cry
teach
me
your
love
or
let
me
die
summer
song
my
a
yellow
butterfly
that
flutters
down
the
road
a
beggar
tricksy
dancing
thing
that
scorns
a
fixed
abode
the
aigrette
of
the
thistle
bloom
becomes
the
swinging
sign
of
merry
hostelries
where
i
may
pause
awhile
and
dine
the
sky
is
lapis
lazuli
bestrewn
by
clouds
of
pearl
who
would
not
be
a
butterfly
instead
of
just
a
girl
seraphis
he
tasted
blood
from
the
dark
dragon
tree
in
those
far
islands
where
the
mood
is
and
free
with
cinnamon
and
nard
his
strange
gay
clothes
were
sweet
his
lips
were
fanciful
with
fard
red
flames
played
his
feet
sharp
dancing
pointed
flames
detached
as
butterflies
he
called
them
all
by
secret
names
they
were
his
ecstasies
no
love
no
maiden
bright
might
woo
him
from
his
swoon
for
he
had
tasted
strange
delight
in
lands
beyond
the
moon
vengement
what
was
his
offense
to
you
you
who
sit
dreamless
days
sifting
your
fingers
slim
ashes
in
a
porphyry
vase
hatred
makes
your
eyes
grow
hard
as
you
conjure
forth
his
name
from
the
dust
that
was
his
face
from
the
heart
that
was
his
flame
then
she
lifting
heavy
eyes
spoke
this
man
walked
the
world
him
i
loved
he
loved
not
me
so
his
days
to
death
i
hurled
then
he
touched
my
hand
smiled
and
whispered
this
his
vengeance
on
my
soul
i
must
hate
him
while
i
autumn
love
i
once
i
could
love
this
season
of
the
year
and
watch
the
calm
and
delicate
decline
of
summer
gladly
i
could
see
the
pine
deep
green
on
bluest
sky
and
laugh
for
cheer
of
very
living
yet
fain
appear
unhurried
gourmet
tasting
of
my
wine
lingering
memories
of
the
purpled
vine
loath
for
each
passing
moment
ah
my
dear
now
like
a
careless
child
i
toss
the
hours
over
my
shoulder
i
forget
the
sun
the
dewy
dawn
the
white
moon
and
the
flowers
like
a
tired
pilgrim
with
his
goal
in
view
looking
not
right
nor
left
i
run
i
run
to
that
bright
day
of
days
that
brings
me
you
ii
i
feel
as
murderers
feel
who
having
slain
their
love
laugh
with
red
hands
and
do
not
care
i
took
sweet
summer
by
her
lovely
hair
bent
her
white
throat
and
gladly
saw
the
stain
crimson
her
green
of
hill
and
plain
i
would
not
wait
for
her
last
kiss
nor
spare
one
splendid
flying
hour
for
chill
and
fair
autumn
my
love
comes
near
me
the
rain
pale
with
mysterious
wonder
her
deep
eyes
are
wells
of
wisdom
fugitive
astray
from
a
blue
land
that
dreams
beyond
the
skies
done
i
lay
young
summer
on
her
pyre
and
turning
burn
distance
to
the
day
that
brings
me
to
the
lips
of
my
desire
the
witch
whence
came
the
fire
in
her
eyes
eyes
of
a
beast
in
the
jungle
desperate
golden
and
green
wild
as
a
river
in
spate
her
long
lithe
limbs
were
brown
and
she
took
the
world
as
a
leopard
grave
disdainful
and
strong
takes
of
his
prey
without
hate
glamourie
slept
in
her
eyes
terribly
calm
in
the
tumult
hidden
and
secret
and
sweet
was
the
smile
of
her
crimson
mouth
a
marigold
wound
in
her
hair
she
swayed
like
wind
in
the
desert
burning
and
thrilling
to
thirst
the
hearts
that
dream
of
the
south
whence
came
the
fire
in
her
eyes
i
only
i
knew
the
secret
the
thing
that
hung
on
her
breast
hid
by
her
stormy
hair
amber
drops
on
a
string
her
talisman
amber
golden
yellow
and
brown
that
only
a
witch
may
wear
the
man
the
flame
is
spent
i
can
no
more
hold
the
tall
candle
by
your
door
too
often
have
i
watched
to
see
your
lagging
steps
come
home
to
me
the
tyrian
traders
taught
me
this
they
came
perfumed
with
ambergris
with
amethystine
robes
and
hair
curled
by
the
kisses
of
salt
air
they
mocked
me
for
my
weary
hands
holding
your
light
as
love
demands
they
sang
the
lure
of
poppied
sleep
their
lips
were
warm
their
eyes
were
deep
the
flame
is
spent
your
pale
weak
face
must
seek
another
resting
place
win
me
and
hold
me
now
who
can
the
tyrian
trader
was
a
man
down
in
maldonado
town
a
town
called
maldonado
the
place
where
i
would
be
a
girl
in
maldonado
and
she
gave
her
heart
to
me
starved
with
sixty
days
of
sailing
how
we
swaggered
to
the
shore
hands
in
pockets
eyes
cocked
sideways
at
the
girl
in
every
door
sweet
they
fluttered
to
our
shoulders
she
my
girl
the
fairest
girl
and
i
took
her
for
a
plaything
face
of
flower
and
heart
of
pearl
round
my
neck
she
clung
and
pleaded
but
i
told
her
to
be
wise
said
no
sailor
could
be
faithful
and
his
love
was
ever
lies
then
she
turned
and
left
me
silent
stepping
weary
stepping
slow
merry
was
i
to
have
won
her
and
i
laughed
to
see
her
go
now
done
i
have
lost
her
seas
between
us
thunder
wide
i
said
shall
forget
you
and
god
knows
that
i
have
lied
many
girls
have
smiled
upon
me
up
and
down
the
northern
coast
but
their
kisses
only
taunt
me
with
the
kiss
that
i
have
lost
oh
killing
me
by
inches
velvet
lips
and
eyes
of
brown
for
love
i
left
behind
me
down
in
maldonado
town
the
choice
the
long
well
rose
above
me
a
slim
shaft
with
wet
black
walls
and
high
aloft
the
light
round
as
a
moon
intensified
my
night
i
ate
the
air
and
bitterly
i
quaffed
the
death
damp
nor
my
pleading
nor
my
craft
availed
to
aid
me
in
my
desperate
plight
the
vista
of
high
heaven
the
only
sight
to
see
and
at
my
woe
high
heaven
had
laughed
suddenly
the
darkness
deepened
and
a
face
gloomed
on
the
opening
terrible
and
grim
an
afreet
in
his
hands
he
held
disgrace
and
direst
poverty
and
ruinous
strife
now
between
he
cried
death
by
him
and
life
empoisoned
yet
i
cried
the
brook
i
have
a
little
brook
in
the
deeps
of
my
heart
what
does
it
matter
if
the
day
be
chill
or
clear
coloured
like
a
tourmaline
and
wingèd
like
a
dart
voiced
like
a
nightingale
it
sings
all
the
year
small
bright
herbs
on
the
banks
of
the
stream
primroses
and
tapestries
of
fern
this
is
the
reality
and
life
is
just
a
dream
iridescent
bubble
that
the
moon
tides
turn
at
the
end
of
the
world
to
the
end
to
the
end
did
i
wander
seeking
you
and
wide
was
the
water
and
dark
was
the
fell
with
time
at
my
heels
like
a
hound
of
hell
and
the
worst
still
left
to
do
to
the
end
to
the
end
and
the
void
to
verify
they
told
me
of
a
tale
of
love
supreme
i
cried
have
caught
the
gleam
i
shall
seek
it
i
at
the
end
at
the
end
at
the
end
of
the
endless
mile
nothing
to
see
but
the
silent
snow
i
turned
with
my
tears
to
your
heart
and
lo
love
was
with
me
all
the
while
the
gypsy
o
she
was
most
precious
as
the
self
was
fair
what
did
i
give
her
when
i
had
her
on
my
knee
red
kisses
for
her
coral
lips
and
a
red
comb
for
her
hair
she
took
my
gifts
she
took
my
heart
and
fled
away
from
me
o
but
she
was
fanciful
she
found
a
savage
mate
he
scorned
her
he
spurned
her
he
drove
her
from
his
door
she
cuddled
in
his
inglenook
and
laughed
at
all
his
hate
she
took
his
curses
took
his
blows
and
never
left
him
more
boy
dreams
must
i
leave
you
in
the
mountains
boy
dreams
must
i
leave
you
where
the
fountains
toss
the
silver
of
their
streams
where
the
trees
are
clothed
in
samite
and
the
little
broken
moon
is
a
symbol
and
an
answer
like
the
reading
of
a
rune
may
i
take
you
to
the
city
boy
dreams
where
your
heart
will
break
with
pity
at
the
lethargy
that
seems
only
half
alive
to
living
only
enemy
to
mirth
where
the
dusty
facts
will
blind
you
to
the
fancies
of
the
earth
i
must
take
you
but
keep
you
boy
dreams
where
no
alien
winds
shall
sweep
you
in
a
secret
place
that
gleams
with
the
light
of
your
own
laughter
yours
the
vessel
yours
the
chart
and
brave
the
storm
together
you
the
captain
of
my
heart
ballad
of
the
slave
the
helot
got
him
a
hempen
cord
a
slave
of
love
was
he
made
me
dance
to
her
circumstance
in
the
air
one
dances
free
she
sits
on
a
throne
of
ivory
serene
in
her
silver
gown
woe
he
cried
the
world
is
wide
but
straight
where
i
lie
down
mocked
she
scorned
and
she
hated
me
she
shall
pity
me
not
he
said
late
for
the
nether
way
of
hate
i
may
flout
her
when
out
in
the
dark
of
the
moonless
sky
the
rope
was
round
his
neck
the
torque
of
gold
from
her
throat
so
cold
why
should
i
rue
or
reck
tighter
tangled
the
hempen
cord
her
fingers
hot
with
fire
in
a
tempest
of
fear
she
draws
me
near
now
dying
is
not
so
dire
black
more
black
grew
the
empty
void
i
but
a
broken
reed
for
only
her
face
in
this
grisly
but
his
love
stood
there
indeed
close
to
her
heart
she
took
his
head
and
she
kissed
him
back
to
breath
are
mine
by
right
of
that
line
of
white
you
are
mine
by
life
and
death
foam
i
have
dallied
with
wantons
made
mad
by
their
passionate
wine
time
like
a
golden
ball
i
have
tossed
to
the
wastes
of
the
air
i
have
whispered
with
beauty
whose
song
has
been
sister
to
mine
laughed
with
the
long
late
hours
who
lie
with
the
stars
in
their
hair
like
the
spume
on
the
crest
of
the
wave
blowing
back
to
the
sea
cast
from
the
depths
beneath
now
to
riot
and
dance
in
the
light
i
have
flung
you
the
foam
of
my
heart
to
be
mask
unto
me
caught
to
my
heart
again
from
the
doom
of
your
fugitive
sight
the
seal
the
document
of
day
is
folded
down
night
the
great
lawyer
takes
the
waiting
sheet
and
the
murky
shadows
of
the
town
sets
his
red
seal
to
make
the
deed
complete
release
i
asked
to
be
released
i
did
not
know
hate
not
love
that
would
not
let
me
go
vengeance
had
burned
your
image
on
my
mind
i
gazed
and
gazed
until
my
eyes
were
blind
now
neither
pride
nor
love
has
set
me
free
but
happy
chance
in
wonderful
degree
shackled
by
memory
a
prey
to
fear
once
you
were
mine
by
the
black
load
i
bore
but
now
released
i
lose
you
o
my
dear
ever
irrevocably
mine
no
more
sin
the
sword
sin
was
a
terrible
and
ruddy
sword
my
hands
were
only
lilies
only
made
to
lay
against
his
lips
and
so
i
prayed
another
weapon
willingly
i
poured
on
his
strong
heart
the
gifts
that
could
accord
with
my
fact
but
ah
the
gifts
were
weighed
and
all
found
wanting
and
i
was
afraid
of
love
which
was
so
dreadfully
my
lord
he
showed
me
the
magnificence
the
height
to
be
attained
for
those
who
dare
to
seek
for
those
who
dare
the
wonder
and
delight
i
might
attain
i
might
but
if
i
should
i
was
afraid
my
fainting
heart
was
weak
and
so
love
help
me
i
was
only
good
fantastic
spring
wear
a
lure
fantastical
farthingales
of
spring
till
the
city
hearts
dance
for
you
and
sing
lime
us
with
grotesque
desires
warm
with
green
and
gold
apathetic
we
have
grown
tired
and
hard
and
old
draw
us
gently
to
your
truth
calm
our
hopes
and
fears
till
at
last
the
grass
blades
speak
to
attentive
ears
song
we
only
ask
for
sunshine
we
did
not
want
the
rain
but
see
the
flowers
that
spring
from
showers
all
up
and
down
the
plain
we
beg
the
gods
for
laughter
we
shrink
we
dread
the
tears
but
redress
is
happiness
alternate
through
the
years
contrast
steady
stand
the
ilex
trees
all
the
leaves
are
still
motionless
the
opal
haze
drowses
on
the
hill
there
a
marble
statue
waits
patient
of
the
hours
ringed
about
with
silent
sun
over
dreamy
flowers
nature
mirrors
perfect
peace
round
me
everywhere
only
in
my
heart
is
found
torment
and
despair
the
price
we
are
so
tired
of
merely
being
human
loving
or
loved
the
sweet
imperfect
woman
masters
you
know
not
what
your
lips
have
missed
on
the
rose
mouths
you
keep
but
to
be
kissed
we
are
astarte
we
are
lilith
we
know
the
blue
veils
which
you
have
named
the
sea
cover
the
eyes
of
isis
that
the
sky
is
the
white
body
of
neith
arched
so
on
high
ours
is
a
secret
language
when
we
smile
dreams
are
denied
at
birth
all
to
beguile
your
earthy
substance
ah
at
what
fell
cost
we
pay
you
so
our
heritage
is
lost
the
daughter
she
was
the
fairest
of
the
fair
daughters
gold
and
rubies
glittered
on
her
hands
her
voice
was
the
lilting
of
a
rain
of
silver
waters
and
her
lovers
were
as
endless
as
her
lands
down
the
birch
wood
with
her
maidens
all
about
her
so
virginal
she
came
with
dainty
tread
at
my
eyes
she
was
silent
could
a
gypsy
turn
and
flout
her
love
i
looked
and
love
i
spoke
till
white
grew
red
free
she
was
as
fair
she
forgot
her
palace
left
her
lands
to
wander
at
my
side
she
is
crowned
with
forest
leaves
with
my
two
curved
hands
for
chalice
spring
and
love
must
bring
a
gypsy
to
his
bride
lais
you
are
white
as
the
moths
of
twilight
you
are
secret
as
mist
and
dew
and
your
eyes
are
eternally
wise
strange
sins
have
wrought
their
hue
mother
of
men
and
women
they
are
ghosts
not
men
you
have
bred
in
infinite
scorn
their
bodies
were
born
while
their
souls
were
worse
than
dead
we
are
what
your
lips
have
made
us
empty
and
bitterly
old
our
faith
has
lied
oh
barren
bride
and
the
fires
of
the
world
are
cold
the
heritage
how
shall
the
present
verify
the
past
like
flames
we
strove
still
onward
upward
rising
spurning
the
singing
continents
at
last
wrecked
on
this
fatal
day
of
our
devising
nurtured
by
lunar
rainbows
chill
and
sweet
our
fancy
was
a
gossamer
of
beauty
now
like
a
web
it
drags
about
our
feet
named

green
her
face
beneath
was
ripe
for
love
with
sparks
between
simples
she
came
to
gather
there
with
hands
of
ivory
gold
fillets
bound
her
golden
hair
her
gown
was
cramosie
she
plucked
the

with
subtle

derisive
in
her
deed
was
there
no

read

no

yesterday

dead
one
hearth
is
bare

fingers
fed

fire

weary
of
the
play
a
lad
laughed
the
open
door
and
stole
my
dear
away
and
now
alone
i
face
the
road
no
hearth
no
home
for
me
and
yet
ah
life
come
sun
come
rain
my
beggar
soul
is
free
black
and
gold
round
her
knees
her
lovers
yearned
she
who
sat
in
black
and

what
recked
she
who
begged
or
burned
sister
to
the

of

darkness
was
her
pedigree

her
ever
living
flame

for
such
as
she
paying
for
her
smiles
with
shame
round
her
head
the
music
floats
black
by
night
and
gold
by
day
these
are
inchoate
notes
calling
come
bride
of
gods
wife
to
primeval
age
what
to
her
shall
serve
these
clods
save
to
irk
her
pilgrimage
the
answer
the
themes
of

mounting
up
the
sky
beating
the
air
with
tremulous
weak
wings
how
shall
so
small
a
matter
win
so
high
the
vain
sweet
goal
of
their
imaginings
striving
for
beauty
dark
philosophy
or
the
obscure
and
purple
deeps
of
truth
how
shall
they
know
their
one
great
verity
the
answer
to
their
queries
and
their
youth
simple
vain
themes
of
women
only
this
one
theme
may
lift
their
wings
to
goals
above
to
spill
their
hearts
out
blindly
in
a
kiss
an
infinite
surrendering
to
love
peace
night
thundered
down
the
valley
from
off
the
rocky
steeps
like
wind
it
broke
the
silences
that
light
divinely
keeps
as
low
dark
clouds
concealing
the
things
one
dare
not
see
so
grimly
dark
and
ominous
hung
low
each
shadowy
tree
night
the
dread
what
wordless
woe
he
weaves
suddenly
peace
and
all
the
air
is
scented
with
green
leaves
barnabas
they
all
are
dead
but
barnabas
wait
with
his
old
groping
hands
and
haggard
eyes
which
nothing
in
the
world
can
now
surprise
till
the
last
leaf
whirls
the
clanging
gate
of
the
last
sunrise
did
he
learn
too
late
maybe
that
one
may
hear
the
moans
and
cries
that
ring
by
night
and
yet
be
calm
and
wise
and
teach
the
women
how
a
man
can
hate
i
did
not
think
a
soul
could
live
so
long
and
be
so
little
he
remembers
youth
with
a
wry
smile
of
disbelief
the
wrong
was
this
he
squeezed
the
fruit
so
dry
so
long
ago
and
now
must
live
forsooth
because
a
woman
will
not
let
him
die
lost
dreams
coming
the
porch
of
dreams
to
the
portal
of
the
day
vacant
all
the
ether
seems
with
a
grief
that
leaves
her
grey
in
a
threnody
of
sighs
with
the
cloud
wreaths
her
face
morning
veils
her
heavy
eyes
weeping
for
her
vanished
grace
ah
in
gaining
lusty
dawn
life
and
pleasant
facts
of
light
why
must
we
the
darkness
gone
lose
the
dreams
that
haunt
the
night
lady
of
light
light
of
the
world
what
are
violets
but
eyes
of
you
perfume
your
hair
blowing
back
on
the
breeze
ah
but
the
fugitive
dainty
surprise
of
you
pricking
in
green
on
the
blossomy
trees
give
me
the
sun
of
your
smile
to
be
fire
to
me
give
me
the
moon
when
the
passion
is
gone
give
me
the
light
to
be
dream
and
desire
to
me
down
the
dark
alleys
that
lead
to
the
dawn
song
you
are
the
dawning
of
dreams
you
are
the
end
of
desire
you
are
the
gladness
and
glory
that
seems
dauntless
to
urge
and
aspire
cradle
my
soul
on
your
wings
cradle
my
head
on
your
breast
teach
me
the
ardour
that
conquers
and
sings
grant
me
your
infinite
rest
the
gypsy
blood
because
the
lover
cares
for
daffodils
must
we
be
stranger
to
the
passion
flower
or
slight
the
iris
dewy
from
a
shower
the
gypsy
heather
bloom
upon
the
hill
strikes
fiercely
on
a
gypsy
heart
and
thrills
new
argosies
of
dreams
to
sail
the
hours
no
rosy
perfume
blown
from
garden
bowers
may
bear
the
subtle
perfume
this
distills
must
we
forego
the
dreamy
twilight
stars
because
the
lives
for
morning
sun
love
dare
not
hold
the
sense
behind
such
bars
the
moon
drips
scented
petals
on
our
hair
and
gypsy
hearts
to
gypsy
flowers
must
run
while
life
is
everything
love
be
fair
and
yet
inadequate
and
void
the
days
are
not
more
tired
than
tears
and
yet
how
long
how
long
the
ways
down
the
bare
lane
of
years
the
bird
that
flutters
from
the
nest
is
fused
of
fire
and
spring
and
yet
how
soon
the
throbbing
breast
will
lose
the
life
to
sing
how
long
the
lane
how
soon
past
rough
road
dark
sky
above
and
yet
dear
heart
home
at
last
with
light
and
life
and
love
the
pleached
alleys
the
pleached
alley
in
my
garden
of
the
spring
merry
leaves
tossed
over
me
with
elfish
whispering
i
was
not
alone
alone
for
love
with
blowing
hair
touched
my
hands
and
touched
my
heart
dancing
everywhere
darting
round
about
my
steps
as
a
swallow
slips
how
she
laughed
and
laughed
at
me
with
little
rosy
lips
ghostly
wise
she
kissed
my
eyes
her
mouth
was
chill
as
snow
for
she
had
died
my
love
had
died
so
very
long
ago
