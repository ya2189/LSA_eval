but
i
behold
you
when
leaves
fall
in
some
sad
evening
op
the
in
memorabilia
mortis
i
i
marked
the
slow
withdrawal
of
the
year
out
on
the
hills
the
scarlet
maples
the
glad
first
herald
of
triumphant
dawn
a
song
fell
through
the
as
long
ago
it
rang
when
june
was
here
then
suddenly
a
few
grey
clouds
were
drawn
across
the
sky
and
all
the
song
was
gone
and
all
the
gold
was
quick
to
disappear
that
day
the
sun
seemed
loth
to
come
again
and
all
day
long
the
low
wind
spoke
of
rain
far
off
beyond
the
hills
and
moaned
like
one
wounded
among
the
pines
as
though
the
earth
knowing
some
giant
grief
had
come
to
birth
had
wearied
of
the
summer
and
the
sun
ii
i
watched
the
slow
oncoming
of
the
fall
slowly
the
leaves
fell
from
the
elms
and
lay
along
the
roadside
and
the
strange
way
was
their
way
when
they
heard
the
far
call
the
crimson
vines
that
clung
along
the
wall
grew
thin
as
snow
that
lives
on
into
may
grey
dawn
grey
noon
things
and
hours
were
grey
when
quietly
the
darkness
covered
all
and
while
no
sunset
flamed
across
the
west
and
no
great
moon
rose
where
the
hills
were
low
the
day
passed
out
as
if
it
had
not
been
and
so
it
seemed
the
year
sank
to
its
rest
remembering
naught
desiring
naught
though
early
in
spring
its
young
leaves
were
not
green
iii
a
little
while
before
the
fall
was
done
a
day
came
when
the
frail
year
paused
and
said
behold
a
little
while
and
i
am
dead
wilt
thou
not
choose
of
all
the
old
dreams
one
then
dwelt
i
in
a
garden
where
the
sun
shone
always
and
the
roses
all
were
red
far
off
the
great
sea
slept
and
overhead
among
the
robins
matins
had
begun
and
i
knew
not
at
all
it
was
a
dream
only
and
that
the
year
was
near
its
close
garden
and
sunshine
and
rose
the
murmur
and
the
distant
gleam
of
all
the
unvext
sea
a
little
space
were
as
a
mist
above
the
face
iv
and
in
this
garden
sloping
to
the
sea
i
dwelt
it
seemed
to
watch
a
pageant
pass
great
kings
their
armour
strong
with
iron
and
brass
young
queens
with
yellow
hair
bound
wonderfully
for
sake
and
because
of
decree
most
went
i
knew
and
so
the
flowers
and
grass
knew
my
steps
also
yet
i
wept
alas
deeming
the
garden
surely
lost
to
me
but
as
the
days
went
over
and
still
our
feet
trod
the
warm
even
places
i
knew
well
for
i
as
they
followed
the
beat
of
wide
wings
who
was
her
sentinel
that
here
had
beauty
built
her
citadel
and
only
we
should
reach
her
v
and
ye
are
ye
not
with
me
now
alway
thy
raiment
glauce
shall
be
my
attire
east
of
the
sun
i
too
seek
my
desire
my
kisses
also
quicken
the
clay
and
thou
alcestis
lest
my
little
day
be
done
art
glad
to
die
upon
my
pyre
o
brynhild
let
thine
ashes
feed
the
fire
and
o
thou
wood
sun
pray
for
me
i
pray
yea
ye
are
mine
yet
there
remaineth
one
who
maketh
of
all
the
year
whose
glory
darkeneth
the
very
sun
for
thee
my
sword
was
sharpened
and
my
spear
for
thee
my
least
poor
deed
was
dreamed
and
done
o
love
o
queen
o
golden
guenevere
vi
then
suddenly
i
was
awake
dead
things
were
all
about
me
and
the
year
was
dead
save
where
the
birches
grew
all
leaves
were
shed
and
nowhere
fell
the
sound
of
song
or
wings
the
fields
i
deemed
were
graves
of
worshipped
kings
had
lost
their
bloom
no
now
fed
therein
and
no
white
daisy
bowed
its
head
to
harken
to
the
yet
by
my
dream
i
know
henceforth
for
me
this
time
of
year
shall
hold
some
unknown
grace
when
the
leaves
fall
and
shall
be
sanctified
as
april
only
comes
for
memory
of
him
who
kissed
the
veil
from
face
that
we
might
see
and
passed
at
