in

hours

ere
yet
they
brought
the
wounded
in
through
vigils
of
the
fateful
night
in
lousy
barns
by
in
sagging
and
aflood
on
stretchers
stiff
and
bleared
with
blood
by
ragged
grove
by
ruined
road
by
hearths
accurst
where
love
abode
by
broken
altars
blackened
shrines
i
tinkered
at
my
bits
of
rhymes
i
solaced
me
with
scraps
of
song
the
desolated
ways
along
through
sickly
fields
all
and
meadows
reaped
by
death
alone
by
blazing
cross
and
splintered
spire
by
headless
virgin
in
the
mire
by
gardens
gashed
amid
their
bloom
by
gutted
grave
by
shattered
tomb
beside
the
dying
and
the
dead
where
rocket
green
and
rocket
red
in
trembling
pools
of
poising
light
with
flowers
of
flame
festoon
the
night
ah
me
by
what
dark
ways
of
wrong
i
cheered
my
heart
with
scraps
of
song
so
here
my
sheaf
of
verse
and
some
is
bad
and
some
is
worse
and
if
at
times
i
curse
a
bit
you
need
read
that
part
of
it
for
through
it
all
like
horror
runs
the
red
resentment
of
the
guns
and
you
yourself
would
mutter
when
you
took
the
things
that
once
were
men
and
sped
them
through
that
zone
of
hate
to
where
the
dripping
surgeons
wait
and
wonder
too
if
in
god
sight
war
ever
ever
can
be
right
yet
may
it
not
be
crime
and
war
but
effort
misdirected
are
and
if
there
good
in
war
and
crime
there
may
be
in

bits
of

leave
them
as
you
will

bells

the
fool
but
it
is
playing
the
game
he
said
and
he
slammed
his
books
away
the
latin
and
greek
i
got
in
my
head
will
do
for
a
duller
day
rubbish
i
cried
the
bugle
call
is
for
lads
from
school
d
think
he
listen
oh
not
at
all
so
i
called
him
a
fool
a
fool
now
there
his
dog
by
his
empty
bed
and
the
flute
he
used
to
play
and
his
favourite
bat
but
dick
he
dead
somewhere
in
france
they
say
dick
with
his
rapture
of
song
and
sun
dick
of
the
yellow
hair
dicky
whose
life
had
but
begun
out
there
look
at
his
prizes
all
in
a
row
surely
a
hint
of
fame
now
he
finished
with
nothing
to
show
does
it
seem
a
shame
look
from
the
window
all
you
see
was
to
be
his
one
day
forest
and
furrow
lawn
and
lea
and
he
goes
and
chucks
it
away
chucks
it
away
to
die
in
the
dark
somebody
saw
him
fall
part
of
him
mud
part
of
him
blood
the
rest
of
him
not
at
all
and
yet
i
bet
he
was
never
afraid
and
he
went
as
the
best
of
go
for
his
hand
was
clenched
on
his
broken
blade
and
his
face
was
turned
to
the
foe
and
i
called
him
a
fool
oh
how
blind
was
i
and
the
cup
of
my
grief
abrim
will
glory
o
england
ever
die
so
long
as
we
lads
like
him
so
long
as
we
fond
and
fearless
fools
who
spurning
fortune
and
fame
turn
out
with
the
rallying
cry
of
their
schools
just
bent
on
playing
the
game
a
fool
ah
no
he
was
more
than
wise
his
was
the
proudest
part
he
died
with
the
glory
of
faith
in
his
eyes
and
the
glory
of
love
in
his
heart
and
though
there
never
a
grave
to
tell
nor
a
cross
to
mark
his
fall
thank
god
we
know
that
he
batted
well
in
the
last
great
game
of
all
the
volunteer
sez
i
my
country
calls
well

it
call

grins
perlitely
and

bunch
out

unless

i
ceased
to
think
i
only
know
i
got
ta
go
bill
got
ta
go
the
convalescent
so
i
walked
among
the
willows
very
quietly
all
night
there
was
no
moon
at
all
at
all
no
timid
star
alight
there
was
no
light
at
all
at
all
i
wint
from
tree
to
tree
and
i
called
him
as
his
mother
called
but
he
nivver
answered
me
oh
i
called
him
all
the
as
i
walked
the
wood
alone
and
i
listened
and
i
listened
but
i
nivver
heard
a
moan
then
i
found
him
at
the
dawnin
when
the
sorry
sky
was
red
i
was
lookin
for
the
livin
but
i
only
found
the
dead
sure
i
know
that
it
was
shamus
by
the
silver
cross
he
wore
but
the
bugles
they
were
callin
and
i
heard
the
cannon
roar
oh
i
had
no
time
to
tarry
so
i
said
a
little
prayer
and
i
clasped
his
hands
together
and
i
left
him
lyin
there
now
the
birds
are
singin
singin
and
i
home
in
donegal
and
it
springtime
and
i
thinkin
that
i
only
dreamed
it
all
i
dreamed
about
that
evil
wood
all
crowded
with
its
dead
where
i
knelt
beside
me
brother
when
the
was
red
where
i
prayed
beside
me
brother
ere
i
wint
to
fight
anew
such
dreams
as
these
are
evil
dreams
i
ca
believe
it
true
where
all
is
love
and
laughter
sure
it
hard
to
think
of
loss
but
mother
sayin
nothin
and
she
clasps
silver
the
man
from
athabaska
oh
the
wife
she
tried
to
tell
me
that
was
nothing
but
the
thrumming
of
a
on
the
hollow
of
a
tree
and
she
thought
that
i
was
fooling
when
i
said
it
was
the
drumming
of
the
mustering
of
legions
and
was
calling
unto
me
was
calling
me
to
pull
my
freight
and
hop
across
the
sea
and
of
my
sure
i
started
up
in
wonder
for
i
heard
a
savage
roaring
and
was
coming
from
afar
oh
the
wife
she
tried
to
tell
me
that
was
only
summer
thunder
and
she
laughed
a
bit
sarcastic
when
i
told
her
it
was
war
was
the
chariots
of
battle
where
the
mighty
armies
are
then
down
the
lake
came
tom
with
russet
sail
and
the
word
he
said
was
war
again
so
what
was
i
to
do
oh
the
dogs
they
took
to
howling
and
the
missis
took
to
crying
as
i
flung
my
silver
foxes
in
the
little
birch
canoe
yes
the
old
girl
stood
till
an
island
hid
the
view
says
the
factor
mike
you
crazy
they
have
soldier
men
you
as
grizzled
as
a
badger
and
you
sixty
year
or
so
but
i
have
missed
a
scrap
says
i
since
i
was
one
and
twenty
and
shall
i
miss
the
biggest
you
can
bet
your
whiskers
no
so
i
sold
my
furs
and
started
and
that
eighteen
months
ago
for
i
joined
the
foreign
legion
and
they
put
me
for
a
starter
in
the
trenches
of
the
argonne
with
the
boche
a
step
away
and
the
partner
on
my
right
hand
was
an
from
montmartre
on
my
left
there
was
a
millionaire
from
pittsburg
a
poor
fellow
they
collected
him
in
bits
the
other
day
but
i
sprier
than
a
chipmunk
save
a
touch
of
the
lumbago
and
they
calls
me
old
methoosalah
and
me
all
the
day
i
their
exhibition
sniper
and
they
work
me
like
a
dago
and
laugh
to
see
me
plug
a
boche
a
half
a
mile
away
oh
i
hold
the
highest
record
in
the
regiment
they
say
and
at
night
they
gather
round
me
and
i
tell
them
of
my
roaming
in
the
country
of
the
crepuscule
beside
the
frozen
sea
where
the
runs
unchallenged
and
the
cariboo
goes
homing
and
they
sit
like
little
children
just
as
quiet
as
can
be
men
of
every
crime
and
colour
how
they
harken
unto
me
and
i
tell
them
of
the
furland
of
the
tumpline
and
the
paddle
of
secret
rivers
loitering
that
no
one
will
explore
and
i
tell
them
of
the
ranges
of
the
and
the
saddle
and
they
fill
their
pipes
in
silence
and
their
eyes
beseech
for
more
while
above
the
fizzle
and
the
high
explosives
roar
and
i
tell
of
lakes
where
the
big
bull
moose
are
calling
and
forests
still
as
sepulchres
with
never
trail
or
track
and
valleys
packed
with
purple
gloom
and
mountain
peaks
appalling
and
i
tell
them
of
my
cabin
on
the
shore
at
fond
du
lac
and
i
find
myself
sure
i
wish
that
i
was
back
so
i
brag
of
bear
and
beaver
while
the
batteries
are
roaring
and
the
fellows
on
the
firing
steps
are
blazing
at
the
foe
and
i
yarn
of
fur
and
feather
when
the
are
and
they
listen
to
my
stories
seven
in
a
row
seven
lean
and
lousy
with
their
cigarettes
aglow
and
i
tell
them
when
it
over
how
i
hike
for
athabaska
and
those
seven
greasy
they
are
crazy
to
go
too
and
i
give
the
wife
the
i
promised
and
i
ask
her
the
price
of
mink
and
marten
and
the
run
of
cariboo
and
i
get
my
traps
in
order
and
i
start
to
work
anew
for
i
had
my
fill
of
fighting
and
i
seen
a
nation
scattered
and
an
army
swung
to
slaughter
and
a
river
red
with
gore
and
a
city
all
and
as
if
it
really
mattered
for
the
lake
is
yonder
dreaming
and
my
cabin
on
the
shore
and
the
dogs
are
leaping
madly
and
the
wife
is
singing
gladly
and
i
rest
in
athabaska
and
i
leave
it
nevermore
the
red
retreat
tramp
the
grim
road
the
road
from
mons
to
wipers
i
out
this
ditty
with
me
bruised
and
bleedin
feet
tramp
tramp
the
dim
road
we
did
no
pipers
and
bellies
that
was
was
the
drums
we
to
beat
tramp
tramp
the
bad
road
the
bits
o
kiddies
cryin
there
the
fell
birds
there
the
all
aflame
tramp
tramp
the
sad
road
the
pals
i
left
there
red

and
dead
oh
blimy
it
a
shame
yer
lady
friend
we
started
out
from
till
our
froats
was
dry
we
did
care
a
the
frenchies
they
lined
the
way
and
slung
us
their
palaver
and
all
we
knowed
to
arnser
was
the
one
word
vang
they
gave
us
booze
and
caporal
and
cheered
for
us
like
crazy
and
all
the
pretty
gels
was
out
to
kiss
us
as
we
passed
and
they
all
went
dotty
when
we
the
marcelaisey
oh
gawd
them
was
the
days
the
days
too
good
to
last
we
started
out
for
god
knows
where
we
started
out
we
we
are
again
and
but
we
was
dry
the
dust
was
gummin
up
our
ears
and
the
sweat
was
pourin
the
road
was
long
the
sun
was
like
a
brazier
in
the
sky
we
wondered
where
the
was
we
was
long
for
down
a
scruff
of
they
rushes
like
a
flood
then
oh
was
music
our
batteries
and
arms
and
legs
went
soarin
in
the
fountain
of
their
blood
for
on
they
came
like
and
we
pumped
the
bullets
into
we
could
miss
a
shot
but
though
we
mowed
down
like
grass
like
grass
was
they
and
all
our
was
blistered
for
our
rifles
was
so
we
roared
with
and
we
lammed
the
stuffin
out
of
and
then
we
fixed
our
and
we
spitted
like
meat
you
should
the
beggars
squeal
you
should
seen
the
rout
of
and
we
cussed
and
wondered
when
the
word
came
retreat
retreat
that
was
the
of
it
it
fair
upset
our
from
them
blighters
over
the
roads
of
france
before
like
a
lot
of
blurry
rabbits
and
knowin
we
could
smash
if
we
just
a
chance
retreat
that
was
the
bitter
bit
and
all
day
and
night
it
and
sleepin
on
our
feet
rear
guard
actions
for
a
bit
o
rest
and
if
sugar
beets
or
mangels
was
the
to
eat
ho
yus
there
is
many
left
that
started
out
so
cheerily
there
was
no

private
mcphun
answers
dommit
auld

i
gang
till

and
he
gets
on
his
feet
wi
a
heave
and
a
strain
and
onward
he
staggers
in
passion
and
pain
and
the
flare
and
the
glare
and
the
fury
increase
till
you
think
they
jist
taken
a
hell
on
a
lease
and
on
they
go
reelin
in
peetifu
plight
and
someone
is
shoutin
away
on
their
right
and
someone
is
runnin
and
noo
they
can
hear
a
sound
like
a
prayer
and
a
sound
like
a
cheer
and
swift
through
the
crash
and
the
flash
and
the
din
the
lads
o
the
hielands
are
bringin
them
in
they
baith
sairly
woundit
but
is
it
no
droll
hoo
they
rave
aboot

says
sergeant
mccole
when
hirplin
alang

wee
wullie
mcnair

a
wonnert
why
he
wis
greetin
sae
sair
and
he
says
i
jist
liftit
it
oot
o
the
pot
and
there
it
lay
steamin
and
savoury
hot
when
sudden
i
dooked
at
the
fleech
o
a
shell
and
it
on
the
haggis
and
dinged
it
tae
and
oh
but
the
lads
were
fair
taken
aback
then
sudden
the
order
wis
passed
tae
attack
and
up
from
the
trenches
like
lions
they
leapt
and
on
through
the
nicht
like
a
torrent
they
swept
on
on
wi
their
bayonets
thirstin
before
on
on
tae
the
foe
wi
a
rush
and
a
roar
and
wild
to
the
welkin
their
rang
and
doon
on
the
boches
like
tigers
they
sprang
and
there
wisna
a
man
but
had
death
in
his
ee
for
he
thocht
o
the
haggis
o
private
mcphee
the
lark
from
dawn
to
dawn
the
guns
have
brayed
without
abate
and
now
the
sick
sun
looks
upon
the
bleared
fields
of
hate
as
if
it
loathed
to
rise
again
how
strange
the
hush
yet
sudden
hark
from
yon
gold
of
grain
the
leaping
rapture
of
a
lark
a
fusillade
of
melody
that
sprays
us
from
yon
trench
of
sky
a
new
amazing
enemy
we
can
not
silence
though
we
try
a
battery
on
radiant
wings
that
from
yon
gap
of
golden
fleece
hurls
at
us
hopes
of
such
strange
things
as
joy
and
home
and
love
and
peace
pure
heart
of
song
do
you
not
know
that
we
are
making
earth
a
hell
or
is
it
that
you
try
to
show
life
still
is
joy
and
all
is
well
brave
little
wings
ah
not
in

party
they

out
cautious
and
slow
come
buck

to
shoulder
so
they
must
think
we
was
old
pal
we
was
never
if
they
arsts
us
if
we
was
we
in
their
fyces
a
song
of
winter
weather
it
is
the
foe
that
we
fear
it
is
the
bullets
that
whine
it
is
the
business
career
of
a
shell
or
the
bust
of
a
mine
it
is
the
snipers
who
seek
to
nip
our
young
hopes
in
the
bud
no
it
is
the
guns
and
it
is
the
huns
it
the
mud
mud
mud
it
is
the
melee
we
mind
that
often
is
rather
good
fun
it
is
the
shrapnel
we
find
obtrusive
when
rained
by
the
ton
it
is
the
bounce
of
the
bombs
that
gives
us
a
positive
pain
it
the
strafing
we
get
when
the
weather
is
wet
it
the
rain
rain
rain
it
is
because
we
lack
grit
we
shrink
from
the
horrors
of
war
we
do
mind
the
battle
a
bit
in
fact
that
is
what
we
are
for
it
is
the
and
things
make
us
wish
we
were
back
in
the
fold
it
the
fingers
that
freeze
in
the
boreal
breeze
it
the
cold
cold
cold
oh
the
rain
the
mud
and
the
cold
the
cold
the
mud
and
the
rain
with
weather
at
zero
it
hard
for
a
hero
from
language
that
rude
to
refrain
with
porridgy
muck
to
the
knees
with
sky
that
a
flood
sure
the
worst
of
our
foes
are
the
pains
and
the
woes
of
the
rain
the
cold
and
the
mud
tipperary
days
oh
were
they
the
fine
boys
you
never
saw
the
beat
of
them
singing
all
together
with
their
throats
and
music
in
the
feet
of
them
swinging
on
to
glory
and
the
wrath
out
there
laughing
by
and
chaffing
by
frolic
in
the
smiles
of
them
on
the
road
the
white
road
all
the
afternoon
strangers
in
a
strange
land
miles

the
gallant
old
contemptibles
there
is
much
remains
of
them
so
full
of
fun
and
fitness
and
in
their
pride
for
some
are
cold
as
clabber
and
the
corby
picks
the
brains
of
them
and
some
are
back
in
blighty
and
they
had
died
and
yet
it
seems
but
yesterday
that
great
glad
sight
of
them
swinging
on
to
battle
as
the
sky
grew
black
and
black
but
oh
their
glee
and
glory
and
the
great
grim
fight
of
them
just
whistle
tipperary
and
it
all
comes
back
a
long
way
to
tipperary
which
means
anywhere
it
a
long
way
to
tipperary
and
the
things
wot
make
you
care
piccadilly
i
my
folks
is
well
it
a
long
long
way
to
tipperary
ai
war
just
fleurette
the
wounded
canadian
speaks
my
leg
it
off
at
the
knee
do
i
miss
it
well
some
you
see
i
had
it
since
i
was
born
and
lately
a
devilish
corn
i
rather
chuckle
with
glee
to
think
how
i
fooled
that
corn
but
i
hobble
around
all
right
it
is
that
it
my
face
oh
i
know
i
a
hideous
sight
hardly
a
thing
in
place
sort
of
gargoyle
you
say
nurse
wo
give
me
a
glass
but
i
see
the
folks
as
they
pass
shudder
and
turn
away
turn
away
in
distress
mirror
enough
i
guess
i
gay
you
bet
i
gay
but
i
was
a
while
ago
if
you
seen
me
even
the
darndest
picture
of
woe
with
this
caliban
mug
of
mine
so
ravaged
and
raw
and
red
turned
to
the
wall
in
fine
wishing
that
i
was
what
has
happened
since
then
since
i
lay
with
my
face
to
the
wall
the
most
despairing
of
men
listen
i
tell
you
all
that
across
the
way
with
the
shrapnel
wound
in
his
head
has
a
sister
she
came
to
sit
awhile
by
his
bed
all
morning
i
heard
him
fret
oh
when
will
she
come
fleurette
then
sudden
a
joyous
cry
the
tripping
of
little
feet
the
softest
tenderest
sigh
a
voice
so
fresh
and
sweet
clear
as
a
silver
bell
fresh
as
the
morning
dews
toi
toi
marcel
mon
frêre
comme
je
suis
heureuse
so
over
the
blanket
rim
i
raised
my
terrible
face
and
i
saw
how
i
envied
him
a
girl
of
such
delicate
grace
sixteen
all
laughter
and
love
as
gay
as
a
linnet
and
yet
as
tenderly
sweet
as
a
dove
half
woman
half
child
fleurette
then
i
turned
to
the
wall
again
i
was
awfully
blue
you
see
and
i
thought
with
a
bitter
pain
such
visions
are
not
for
me
so
there
like
a
log
i
lay
all
hidden
i
thought
from
view
when
sudden
i
heard
her
say
ah
who
is
that
then
briefly
i
heard
him
tell
however
he
came
to
know
how
i
smothered
a
bomb
that
fell
into
the
trench
and
so
none
of
my
men
were
hit
though
it
busted
me
up
a
bit
well
i
did
quiver
an
eye
and
he
chattered
and
there
she
sat
and
i
fancied
i
heard
her
sigh
but
i
would
just
swear
to
that
and
maybe
she
was
so
bright
though
she
talked
in
a
merry
strain
and
i
closed
my
eyes
ever
so
tight
yet
i
saw
her
ever
so
plain
her
dear
little
tilted
nose
her
delicate
dimpled
chin
her
mouth
like
a
budding
rose
and
the
glistening
pearls
within
her
eyes
like
the
violet
such
a
rare
little
queen
fleurette
and
at
last
when
she
rose
to
go
the
light
was
a
little
dim
and
i
ventured
to
peep
and
so
i
saw
her
graceful
and
slim
and
she
kissed
him
and
kissed
him
and
oh
how
i
envied
and
envied
him
so
when
she
was
gone
i
said
in
rather
a
dreary
voice
to
him
of
the
opposite
bed
ah
friend
how
you
must
rejoice
but
me
i
a
thing
of
dread
for
me
nevermore
the
bliss
the
thrill
of
a
woman
kiss
then
i
stopped
for
lo
she
was
there
and
a
great
light
shone
in
her
eyes
and
me
i
could
only
stare
i
was
taken
so
by
surprise
when
gently
she
bent
her
head
may
i
kiss
you
sergeant
she
said
then
she
kissed
my
burning
lips
with
her
mouth
like
a
scented
flower
and
i
thrilled
to
the
and
i
had
even
the
power
to
say
god
bless
you
dear
and
i
felt
such
a
precious
tear
fall
on
my
withered
cheek
and
darn
it
i
could
speak
and
so
she
went
sadly
away
and
i
knew
that
my
eyes
were
wet
ah
not
to
my
dying
day
will
i
forget
forget
can
you
wonder
now
i
am
gay
god
bless
her
that
little
fleurette
funk
when
your
marrer
bone
seems
and
you
glad
you
ai
no
taller
and
you
all
like
you
the
chills
when
your
skin
creeps
like
a
pullet
and
you
duckin
all
the
bullets
and
you
green
as
gorgonzola
round
the
gills
when
your
legs
seem
made
of
jelly
and
you
squeamish
in
the
belly
and
you
want
to
turn
about
and
do
a
bunk
for
gawd
sake
kid
do
show
it
do
let
your
mateys
know
it
you
just
sufferin
from
funk
funk
funk
of
course
there
no
that
it
ai
so
easy
to
grin
and
grip
your
rifle
by
the
butt
when
the
world
rips
asunder
and
you
sees
yer
pal
go
under
as
a
bunch
of
shrapnel
sprays
on
the
nut
i
admit
it
when
you
the
shells
arrivin
to
discover
you
a
bloomin
bit
o
spunk
but
my
lad
you
got
to
do
it
and
your
god
will
see
you
through
it
for
wot
is
funk
funk
funk
so

up
son

gritty
and
just
a
lively
ditty
and
only
be
afraid
to
be
afraid
just
yer
rifle
steady
and
yer
ready
for
that
the
way
good
is
made
and
if

to
die
as
it
sometimes
why
far
better

than
a
skunk
of
yer
bit
and
so
to
with
it
there
ai
no
bloomin
funk
funk
funk
our
hero
flowers
only
flowers
bring
me
dainty
posies
blossoms
for
forgetfulness
that
was
all
he
said
so
we
sacked
our
gardens
violets
and
roses
lilies
white
and
bluebells
laid
we
on
his
bed
soft
his
pale
hands
touched
them
tenderly
caressing
soft
into
his
tired
eyes
came
a
little
light
such
a
wistful
gentle
as
a
blessing
there
amid
the
flowers
waited
he
the
night
i
would
have
you
raise
me
i
can
see
the
west
then
i
would
see
the
sun
set
once
before
i
go
so
he
lay
seemed
to
be
at
rest
then
quiet
as
a
spirit
in
the
golden
glow
so
he
lay
rosy
castles
crumbling
moats
of
blinding
amber
bastions
of
flame
rugged
rifts
of
opal
crimson
turrets
tumbling
so
he
lay
till
the
shadows
came
open
wide
the
window
there
a
lark
there
a
glad
lark
singing
in
the
evening
sky
how
it
wild
with
rapture
radiantly
winging
oh
it
good
to
hear
that
when
one
has
to
die
i
am
from
the
hell
they
found
me
i
am
all
i
want
is
rest
ah
it
good
to
die
so
blossoms
all
around
me
and
a
kind
lark
singing
in
the
golden
west
flowers
song
and
sunshine
just
one
thing
is
wanting
just
the
happy
laughter
of
a
little
child
so
we
brought
our
dearest
doris
tenderly
he
kissed
her
radiant
he
smiled
in
the
golden
you
will
tell
the
story
how
for
you
and
yours
sweet
bitter
deaths
were
god
bless
little
children
so
he
passed
to
glory
so
we
left
him
sleeping
still
amid
the
my
mate

milking
time
there
a
drip
of
honeysuckle
in
the
deep
green
lane
there
old
martin
jogging
homeward
on
his
worn
old
wain
there
are
cherry
petals
falling
and
a
cuckoo
calling
calling
and
a
score
of
larks
god
bless
but
it
all
pain
pain
for
you
see
i
am
not
really
there
at
all
not
at
all
for
you
see
i
in
the
trenches
where
the
fall
and
the
bits
o
shells
are
screaming
and
it
only
blessed
dreaming
that
in
fancy
i
am
seeming
back
in
old
saint
pol
oh
i
thought
of
it
so
often
since
i
come
down
here
and
i
never
dreamt
that
any
place
could
be
so
dear
the
silvered
whinstone
houses
and
the
rosy
men
in
blouses
and
the
kindly
women
with
their
eyes
and
mother
sitting
knitting
where
her
roses
climb
and
the
angelus
is
calling
with
a
soft
soft
chime
and
the
comes
caressing
and
the
light
a
golden
blessing
and
yvonne
yvonne
is
guessing
that
it
milking
time
oh
it
sunday
for
she
wearing
of
her
broidered
gown
and
she
draws
the
pasture
pickets
and
the
cows
come
down
and
their
feet
are
powdered
yellow
and
their
voices
and
they
bring
a
scent
of
clover
and
their
eyes
are
brown
and
yvonne
is
dreaming
after
but
her
eyes
are
blue
and
her
lips
are
made
for
laughter
and
her
white
teeth
too
and
her
mouth
is
like
a
cherry
and
a
dimple
mocking
merry
is
lurking
in
the
very
cheek
she
turns
to
you
so
i
walk
beside
her
kindly
and
she
laughs
at
me
and
i
heap
her
arms
with
lilac
from
the
lilac
tree
and
a
golden
light
is
welling
and
a
golden
peace
is
dwelling
and
a
thousand
birds
are
telling
how
it
good
to
be
and
what
are
pouting
lips
for
if
they
ca
be
kissed
and
i
filled
her
arms
with
blossom
so
she
ca
resist
and
the
cows
are
sadly
straying
and
her
mother
must
be
saying
that
yvonne
is
long
delaying
how
close
that
missed
a
nice
polite
reminder
that
the
boche
are
nigh
that
we
here
to
fight
like
devils
and
if
die
that
from
kissing
pretty
wenches
to
the
frantic
of
the
battered
tattered
trenches
is
a
far
far
cry
yet
still
i
sitting
dreaming
in
the
glare
and
grime
and
once
again
i
hearing
of
them
chime
and
how
i
wonder
whether
in
the
golden
summer
weather
we
will
fetch
the
cows
together
when
it
milking
english
voice
months
later

and

and
joy

will
owe
to
our
lads
like
you
a
song
of
the
sandbags
no
bill
i
not
out
no
patriotic
tosh
the
cove
the
sandbags
ai
a
cuss
and
though
i
strafes
good
and
i
does
the
boche
i
guess
they
mostly
decent
just
the
same
as
most
of
us
i
guess
they
loves
their
and
kids
as
much
as
you
or
me
and
just
the
same
as
you
or
me
they
rather
shake
than
fight
and
if
we
to
be
born
at
we
be
out
there
with
and
fritz
dead
sure
that
we
was
right
up
to
the
sandbags
it
funny
the
thoughts
wot
come
starin
into
the
darkness
the
bullets
zing
zip
ping
rip
the
bullets
against
the
sandbags
wiv
me
rifle
under
me
ear
oh
i
more
thoughts
on
a
than
i
used
to
in
a
year
i
wonder
bill
if
and
fritz
is
wonderin
like
me
wot
at
the
bottom
of
it
all
wot
all
the
slaughter
for
thinks
right
of
course
ai
but
this
we
both
agree
if
them
as
made
it
to
fight
there
would
be
no
war
if
them
as
lies
in
feather
beds
while
we
kips
in
the
mud
if
them
as
makes
their
fortoons
while
we
fights

sky
and
the
sky
is
a
torrent
of
fire
foaming
on
me
as
i
lie
here
on
the
wire
the
of
the
thousands
that
wheeze
and
hum
heedlessly
over
my
head
why

a
bullet
come

to
my
brain

forever

forever
my
pain
here
in
the
hellish
glare
why
must
i
suffer
so
is
it
god
does
care
is
it
god
does
know
oh
to
be
killed
outright
clean
in
the
clash
of
the
fight
that
is
a
golden
death
that
is
a
boon
but
this
drawing
an
anguished
breath
under
a
hot
abyss
under
a
stooping
sky
of
seething
sulphurous
fire
scorching
me
up
as
i
lie
here
on
the
wire
the
hasten
o
god
thy
night
hide
from
my
eyes
the
sight
of
the
body
i
stare
and
see
shattered
so
hideously
i
ca
believe
that
it
mine
my
body
was
white
and
sweet
flawless
and
fair
and
fine
shapely
from
head
to
feet
oh
no
i
can
never
be
the
thing
of
horror
i
see
under
the
rifle
fire
trussed
on
the
wire
the
of
night
and
of
death
i
dream
night
that
will
bring
me
peace
coolness
and
starry
gleam
stillness
and
death
release
ages
and
ages
have
passed
lo
it
is
night
at
last
night
but
the
guns
roar
out
night
but
the
hosts
attack
red
and
yellow
and
black
geysers
of
doom
upspout
silver
and
green
and
red
hover
and
spread
yonder
off
to
the
right
fiercely
kindles
the
fight
roaring
near
and
more
near
thundering
now
in
my
ear
close
to
me
close
oh
hark
someone
moans
in
the
dark
i
hear
but
i
can
not
see
i
hear
as
the
rest
retire
someone
is
caught
like
me
caught
on
the
wire
the
again
the
shuddering
dawn
weird
and
wicked
and
wan
again
and
i
not
yet
gone
the
man
whom
i
heard
is
dead
now
i
can
understand
a
bullet
hole
in
his
head
a
pistol
gripped
in
his
hand
well
he
knew
what
to
do
yes
and
now
i
know
hark
the
resentful
guns
oh
how
thankful
am
i
to
think
my
beloved
ones
will
never
know
how
i
die
i
suffered
more
than
my
share
i
shattered
beyond
repair
i
fought
like
a
man
the
fight
and
now
i
demand
the
right
god
how
his
fingers
cling
to
do
without
shame
this
thing
good
there
a
bullet
still
now
i
ready
to
fire
blame
me
god
if
you
will
here
on
the
wire
the
bill

oh
ye
whose
hearts
are
resonant
and
ring
to
war
romance
hear
ye
the
story
of
a
boy
a
peasant
boy
of
france
a
lad
uncouth
and
warped
with
toil
yet
who
when
trial
came
could
feel
within
his
soul
upleap
and
soar
the
sacred
flame
could
stand
upright
and
scorn
and
smite
as
only
heroes
may
oh
harken
let
me
try
to
tell
the
tale
of
jean
desprez
with
fire
and
sword
the
teuton
horde
was
ravaging
the
land
and
there
was
darkness
and
despair
grim
death
on
every
hand
red
fields
of
slaughter
sloping
down
to
ruin
black
abyss
the
wolves
of
war
ran
and
little
did
they
miss
and
on
they
came
with
fear
and
flame
to
burn
and
loot
and
slay
until
they
reached
the
croft
the
home
of
jean
desprez
rout
out
the
village
one
and
all
the
uhlan
captain
said
behold
some
hand
has
fired
a
shot
my
trumpeter
is
dead
now
shall
they
prussian
vengeance
know
now
shall
they
rue
the
day
for
by
this
sacred
german
slain
ten
of
these
dogs
shall
pay
they
drove
the
cowering
peasants
forth
women
and
babes
and
men
and
from
the
last
with
many
a
jeer
the
captain
chose
he
ten
ten
simple
peasants
bowed
with
toil
they
stood
they
knew
not
why
against
the
grey
wall
of
the
church
hearing
their
children
cry
hearing
their
wives
and
mothers
wail
with
faces
dazed
they
stood
a
moment
fire
they
weltered
in
their
blood
but
there
was
one
who
gazed
unseen
who
heard
the
frenzied
cries
who
saw
these
men
in
sabots
fall
before
their
children
eyes
a
zouave
wounded
in
a
ditch
and
knowing
death
was
nigh
he
laughed
with
joy
ah
here
is
where
i
settle
ere
i
die
he
clutched
his
rifle
once
again
and
long
he
aimed
and
a
shot
beside
his
victims
ten
the
uhlan
captain
fell
they
dragged
the
wounded
zouave
out
their
rage
was
like
a
flame
with
bayonets
they
pinned
him
down
until
their
major
came
a
blonde
man
he
was
and
arrogant
of
eye
he
stared
to
see
with
shattered
skull
his
favourite
captain
lie
nay
do
not
finish
him
so
quick
this
foreign
swine
he
cried
go
nail
him
to
the
big
church
door
he
shall
be
crucified
with
bayonets
through
hands
and
feet
they
nailed
the
zouave
there
and
there
was
anguish
in
his
eyes
and
horror
in
his
stare
water
a
single
drop
he
moaned
but
how
they
jeered
at
him
and
mocked
him
with
an
empty
cup
and
saw
his
sight
grow
dim
and
as
in
agony
of
death
with
blood
his
lips
were
wet
the
prussian
major
gaily
laughed
and
lit
a
cigarette
but
mid
the
villagers
who
cowered
in
horror
by
was
one
who
saw
the
woeful
sight
who
heard
the
woeful
cry
water
one
little
drop
i
beg
for
love
of
christ
who
it
was
the
little
jean
desprez
who
turned
and
stole
aside
it
was
the
little
boy
who
came
with
cup
abrim
and
walked
up
to
the
dying
man
and
gave
the
drink
to
him
a
roar
of
rage
they
seize
the
boy
they
tear
him
fast
away
the
prussian
major
swings
around
no
longer
is
he
gay
his
teeth
are
wolfishly
agleam
his
face
all
dark
with
spite
go
shoot
the
brat
he
snarls
that
dare
defy
our
prussian
might
yet
stay
i
have
another
thought
i
kindly
be
and
spare
quick
give
the
lad
a
rifle
charged
and
set
him
squarely
there
and
bid
him
shoot
and
shoot
to
kill
haste
make
him
understand
the
dying
dog
he
fain
would
save
shall
perish
by
his
hand
and
all
his
kindred
they
shall
see
and
all
shall
curse
his
name
who
bought
his
life
at
such
a
cost
the
price
of
death
and
shame
they
brought
the
boy
with
fear
they
made
him
understand
they
stood
him
by
the
dying
man
a
rifle
in
his
hand
make
haste
said
they
the
time
is
short
and
you
must
kill
or
die
the
major
puffed
his
cigarette
amusement
in
his
eye
and
then
the
dying
zouave
heard
and
raised
his
weary
head
shoot
son
be
the
best
for
both
shoot
swift
and
straight
he
said
fire
first
and
last
and
do
not
flinch
for
lost
to
hope
am
i
and
i
will
murmur
la
france
and
bless
you
ere
i
die
with
blows
the
boy
stood
there
he
seemed
to
swoon
and
sway
then
in
that
moment
woke
the
soul
of
little
jean
desprez
he
saw
the
woods
go
sheening
down
the
larks
were
singing
clear
and
oh
the
scents
and
sounds
of
spring
how
sweet
they
were
how
dear
he
felt
the
scent
of
hay
a
soft
breeze
fanned
his
brow
o
god
the
paths
of
peace
and
toil
how
precious
were
they
now
the
summer
days
and
summer
ways
how
bright
with
hope
and
bliss
the
autumn
such
a
dream
of
gold
and
all
must
end
in
this
this
shining
rifle
in
his
hand
that
shambles
all
around
the
zouave
there
with
dying
glare
the
blood
upon
the
ground
the
brutal
faces
round
him
ringed
the
evil
eyes
aflame
that
prussian
bully
standing
by
as
if
he
watched
a
game
make
haste
and
shoot
the
major
sneered
a
minute
more
i
give
a
minute
more
to
kill
your
friend
if
you
yourself
would
live
they
only
saw
a
boy
with
blanched
and
twitching
face
they
did
not
see
within
his
eyes
the
glory
of
his
race
the
glory
of
a
million
men
who
for
fair
france
have
died
the
splendour
of
that
will
not
be
denied
yet
he
was
but
a
peasant
lad
and
oh
but
life
was
your
minute
nearly
gone
my
lad
he
heard
a
voice
repeat
shoot
shoot
the
dying
zouave

and
she
has
a
friend
and
she
has
a
home

as
safe
in
paris
city
as
a
lamb
where
the
wild
wolves
roam
and
that
was
i
oh
it
seven
years
now
some
water
run
down
the
seine
since
then
and
i
almost
forgotten
the
pangs
and
the
tears
now
and
i
almost
taken
the
measure
of
men
oh
i
found
me
a
lover
who
loved
me
only
artist
and
poet
and
almost
a
boy
and
my
heart
was
bruised
and
my
life
was
lonely
and
him
i
adored
with
a
wonderful
joy
if
he
come
to
me
with
his
pockets
empty
how
we
have
laughed
in
a
garret
gay
but
he
was
rich
and
in
radiant
plenty
we
lived
in
a
villa
at
viroflay
then
came
the
war
and
of
bliss
bereft
me
then
came
the
call
and
he
went
away
all
that
he
had
in
the
world
he
left
me
with
the
villa
at
viroflay
then
came
the
news
and
the
tragic
story
my
hero
my
splendid
lover
was
dead
sword
in
hand
on
the
field
of
glory
and
he
died
with
my
name
on
his
lips
they
said
so
here
am
i
in
my
widow
mourning
the
weeds
i
really
no
right
to
wear
and
women
fix
me
with
eyes
of
scorning
call
me
cocotte
but
i
do
not
care
and
men
look
at
me
with
eyes
that
borrow
the
brightness
of
love
but
i
turn
away
alone
say
i
i
will
live
with
sorrow
in
my
little
villa
at
viroflay
and
lo

say
that
pity
from
love
not
far

city

took
the
metro
at
saint
lazare
and
the
carriage
was
crowded
to
overflowing
and
when
there
entered
at
chateaudun
two
wounded
with
medals
showing
i
eagerly
gave
my
seat
to
one
you
should
have
seen
them
they
slipped
death
clutches
but
sadder
a
sight
you
will
rarely
find
one
had
a
leg
off
and
walked
on
crutches
the
other
a
bit
of
a
boy
was
blind
and
they
both
sat
down
and
the
lad
was
trying
to
grope
his
way
as
a
blind
man
tries
and
half
of
the
women
around
were
crying
and
some
of
the
men
had
tears
in
their
eyes
how
he
stirred
me
this
blind
boy
clinging
just
like
a
child
to
his
crippled
chum
but
i
did
not
cry
oh
no
a
singing
came
to
my
heart
for
a
year
so
dumb
then
i
knew
that
at
there
is
wonderful
work
to
be
done
comfort
and
kindness
and
joy
in
plenty
peace
and
light
and
love
to
be
won
oh
thought
i
could
mine
eyes
be
given
to
one
who
will
live
in
the
dark
alway
to
love
and
to
serve
make
life

better

and
at
last
when
you

let
this
be
your
cry
on
my
soul
carry
on
over
the
parapet
all
day
long
when
the
shells
sail
over
i
stand
at
the
sandbags
and
take
my
chance
but
at
night
at
night
i
a
reckless
rover
and
over
the
parapet
gleams
romance
romance
romance
how
i
dreamed
it
writing
dreary
old
records
of
money
and
mart
me
with
my
head
chuckful
of
fighting
and
the
blood
of
vikings
to
thrill
my
heart
but
little
i
thought
that
my
time
was
coming
sudden
and
splendid
supreme
and
soon
and
here
i
am
with
the
bullets
humming
as
i
crawl
and
i
curse
the
light
of
the
moon
out
alone
for
adventure
thirsting
out
in
mysterious
no
man
land
prone
with
the
dead
when
a
bursting
flares
on
the
horrors
on
every
hand
there
are
ruby
stars
and
they
drip
and
wiggle
and
the
grasses
gleam
in
a
light
there
are
emerald
stars
and
their
tails
they
wriggle
and
ghastly
they
glare
on
the
face
of
the
dead
but
the
worst
of
all
are
the
stars
of
whiteness
that
spill
in
a
pool
of
pearly
flame
pretty
as
gems
in
their
silver
brightness
and
etching
a
man
for
a
bullet
aim
yet
oh
it
great
to
be
here
with
danger
here
in
the
weird
dark
in
the
devil
pasture
a
stealthy
ranger
when
the
moon
is
decently
hiding
hark
what
was
that
was
it
just
the
shiver
of
an
eerie
wind
or
a
clammy
hand
the
rustle
of
grass
or
the
passing
quiver
of
one
of
the
ghosts
of
no
man
land
it
only
at
night
when
the
ghosts
awaken
and
gibber
and
whisper
horrible
things
for
to
every
foot
of
this
zone
of
jeopard
some
horror
clings
ugh
what
was
that
it
felt
like
a
jelly
that
flattish
mound
in
the
noisome
grass
you
three
big
rats
running
free
of
its
belly
out
of
my
way
and
let
me
pass
but
if
there
horror
there
beauty
wonder
the
trench
lights
gleam
and
the
rockets
play
that
flood
of
magnificent
orange
yonder
is
a
battery
blazing
miles
away
with
a
rush
and
a
singing
a
great
shell
passes
the
rifles
resentfully
bicker
and
brawl
and
here
i
crouch
in
the
grasses
and
look
and
listen
and
love
it
all
god
what
a
life
but
i
must
make
haste
now
before
the
shadow
of
night
be
spent
it
little
the
time
there
is
to
waste
now
if
i
do
the
job
for
which
i
was
sent
my
bombs
are
right
and
my
clippers
ready
and
i
wriggle
out
to
the
chosen
place
when
i
hear
a
rustle
steady
steady
who
am
i
staring
slap
in
the
face
there
in
the
dark
i
can
hear
him
breathing
a
foot
away
and
as
still
as
death
and
my
heart
beats
hard
and
my
brain
is
seething
and
i
know
he
a
hun
by
the
smell
of
his
breath
then
will
you
surrender
i
whisper
hoarsely
for
it
death
swift
death
to
utter
a
cry
english
he
murmurs
coarsely
then
we
fight
it
out
in
the
dark
say
i
so
we
grip
and
we
slip
and
we
trip
and
wrestle
there
in
the
gutter
of
no
man
land
and
i
feel
my
nails
in
his
nestle
and
he
tries
to
gouge
but
i
bite
his
hand
and
he
tries
to
squeal
but
i
squeeze
him
tighter
now
i
say
i
can
kill
you
fine
but
tell
me
first
you
teutonic
blighter
have
you
any
children
he
answers
nein
well
i
can
not
kill
such
a
father
so
i
tie
his
hands
and
i
leave
him
there
do
i
finish
my
little
job
well
rather
and
i
get
home
safe
with
some
light
to
spare
by
day
it
just
prosy
duty
doing
the
same
old
song
and
dance
but
oh
with
the
night
joy
glory
beauty
over
the
parapet
life
romance
the
ballad
of
soulful
sam
you
want
me
to
tell
you
a
story
a
yarn
of
the
firin
line
of
our
thin
red
kharki
out
there
where
the
bullets
whine
out
there
where
the
bombs
are
bustin
and
the
cannons
like
slam
just
order
another
drink
boys
and
i
tell
you
of
soulful
sam

his
programme

never
was
known
to
cuss
for
a
card
or
a
skirt
or
a
he
a
friendly
word
but
when
it
came
down
to
scriptures

was
he
just
a
bird
he
always
tracts
in
his
pocket
the
which
he
would
haste
to
present
and
though
the
fellers
would
use
them
in
ways
that
they
never
was
meant
i
used
to
read
religious
and
frequent
i
been
impressed
by
some
of
them
bundles
of
dope

carried
around
in
his
vest
for
i
and
oh
i
shudder
at
the
the
word
conveys

let
me
whisper
it

gambler

me
days

gambler

gambler

the
furious
attackin

crouchin
a
sandbag
tryin
to
keep
calm
when
i
someone
singin
a
toon
it
is
soulful
sam
yes
right
in
the
crash
of
the
combat
in
the
fury
of
flash
and
flame
was
shootin
and
singin
serenely
as
if
enjoyed
the
same
and
there
in
the
of
the
battle
as
the
of
demons
attacked
he
dipped
down
into
tunic
and
me
out
a
tract
then
a
flared
and
i
read
it
oh
flee
from
the
wrath
to
come
nice
cheerful
subject
i
tell
yer
when
you
the
bullets
and
before
i
time
to
thank
just
one
of
them
bits
of
lead
comes
slingin
along
in
a
and
it
my
dead
no
siree
not
by
a
long
sight
for
it
plugged
on
the
chest
just
where
tracts
for
a
army
corps
stowed
away
in
vest
on
its
mission
of
death
that
bullet
along
and
it
caved
a
in
them
tracts
to
boys
but
the
life
o
me
pal
was
saved
and
there
as
showed
me
in
triumph
and
was
chokin
me
breath
on
came
another
bullet
on
its
mission
of
death
on
through
the
night
it
cavorted
seekin
its
of
rest
and
it
zipped
through
a
crack
in
the
sandbags
and
it
wolloped
me
bang
on
the
breast
was
i
killed
do
you
ask
oh
no
boys
why
am
i
sittin
gazin
with
mournful
vision
at
a
mug
long
empty
of
beer
with
a
throat
as
dry
as
a
oh
thanky
i
do
much
mind
if
i
do
beer
with
a
dash
of
that
my
particular
brew
yes
that
was
a
terrible
moment
it
me
the
it
bowled
me
down
like
a
and
i
looked
for
the
gore
to
start
and
i
saw
in
the
flash
of
a
moment
in
that
thunder
of
hate
and
strife
me
wretched
past
like
a
pitchur
the
sins
of
a
gambler
life
for
i
no
tracts
to
save
me
to
thwart
that
mad
missile
doom
i
no
pious
pamphlets
to
me
to
cheat
the
tomb
i
no
leaflets
to
baffle
a
bullet
aim
i
only
a
deck
of
cards
boys
but
seemed
to
do
just
the
only
a
boche
we
brought
him
in
from
between
the
lines
we
better
have
let
him
lie
for
what
the
use
of
risking
one
skin
for
a
that
going
to
die
what
the
use
of
tearing
him
loose
under
a
gruelling
fire
when
he
shot
in
the
head
and
worse
than
dead
and
all
messed
up
on
the
wire
however
i
say
we
brought
him
in
the
mud
was
bad
the
trench
was
crooked
and
greasy
and
high
and
oh
what
a
time
we
had
and
often
we
slipped
and
often
we
tripped
but
never
he
made
a
moan
and
how
we
were
wet
with
blood
and
with
sweat
but
we
carried
him
in
like
our
own
now
there
he
lies
in
the
dim
awaiting
the
ambulance
and
the
doctor
shrugs
his
shoulders
at
him
and
remarks
he
has
a
chance
and
we
squat
and
smoke
at
our
game
of
bridge
on
the
glistening
floor
and
above
our
oaths
we
can
hear
his
breath
in
a
kind
of
snore
for
the
dressing
station
is
long
and
low
and
the
candles
gutter
dim
and
the
mean
light
falls
on
the
cold
clay
walls
and
our
faces
bristly
and
grim
and
we
flap
our
cards
on
the
lousy
straw
and
we
laugh
and
jibe
as
we
play
and
you
never
know
that
the
cursed
foe
was
less
than
a
mile
away
as
we
con
our
cards
in
the
rancid
gloom
oppressed
by
that
snoring
breath
you
never
dream
that
our
broad
was
swept
by
the
broom
of
death
my
turn
for
the
dummy
hand
i
rise
and
i
stretch
a
bit
the
fetid
air
is
making
me
yawn
and
my
cigarette
unlit
so
i
go
to
the
nearest
candle
flame
and
the
man
we
brought
is
there
and
his
face
is
white
in
the
shabby
light
and
i
stand
at
his
feet
and
stare
stand
for
a
while
and
quietly
stare
for
strange
though
it
seems
to
be
the
dying
boche
on
the
stretcher
there
has
a
queer
resemblance
to
me
it
gives
one
a
kind
of
a
turn
you
know
to
come
on
a
thing
like
that
it
just
as
if
i
were
lying
there
with
a
turban
of
blood
for
a
hat
lying
there
in
a
coat
instead
of
a
coat
with
one
of
my
eyes
all
shot
away
and
my
brain
half
tumbling
through
lying
there
with
a
chest
that
heaves
like
a
bellows
up
and
down
and
a
cheek
as
white
as
snow
on
a
grave
and
lips
that
are
coffee
brown
and
confound
him
too
he
wears
like
me
on
his
finger
a
wedding
ring
and
around
his
neck
as
around
my
own
by
a
greasy
bit
of
string
a
locket
hangs
with
a
woman
face
and
i
turn
it
about
to
see
just
as
i
thought
on
the
other
side
the
faces
of
children
three
clustered
together
three
little
laughing
girls
with
the
usual
tiny
rosebud
mouths
and
the
usual
silken
curls
zut
i
say
he
has
beaten
me
for
me
i
have
only
two
and
i
push
the
locket
beneath
his
shirt
feeling
a
little
blue
oh
it
is
cheerful
to
see
a
man
the
marvellous
work
of
god
crushed
in
the
mutilation
mill
crushed
to
a
smeary
clod
oh
it
is
cheerful
to
hear
him
moan
but
it
is
that
i
mind
it
is
the
anguish
that
goes
with
him
it
the
anguish
he
leaves
behind
for
his
going
opens
a
tragic
door
that
gives
on
a
world
of
pain
and
the
death
he
dies
those
who
live
and
love
will
die
again
and
again
so
here
i
am
at
my
cards
once
more
but
it
kind
of
spoiling
my
play
thinking
of
those
three
brats
of
his
so
many
a
mile
away
war
is
war
and
he
only
a
boche
and
we
all
of
us
take
our
chance
but
all
the
same
i
be
mighty
glad
when
i
hearing
the
ambulance
one
foe
the
less
but
all
the
same
i
heartily
glad
i
not
the
man
who
gave
him
his
broken
head
the
sniper
who
fired
the
shot
no
trumps
you
make
it
i
think
you
said
you
pardon
me
if
i
err
for
a
moment
i
thought
of
other
things
dieu
quelle
vache
de
pilgrims
for
oh
when
the
war
will
be
over
we
go
and
we
look
for
our
dead
we
go
when
the
bee
on
the
clover
and
the
plume
of
the
poppy
is
red
we
go
when
the
year
at
its
gayest
when
meadows
are
laughing
with
and
there
where
the
crosses
are
greyest
we
seek
for
the
cross
that
is
ours
for
they
cry
to
us
we
are
lonely
the
night
and
the
day
but
come
in
the
only
come
when
our
graves
will
be
gay
when
daffodils
all
are
and
larks
are
the
skies
oh
come
with
the
hearts
of
you
glowing
and
the
joy
of
the
spring
in
your
eyes
never
oh
never
come
sighing
for
ours
was
the
splendid
release
and
oh
but
was
joy
in
the
dying
to
know
we
were
winning
you
peace
so
come
when
the
valleys
are
sheening
and
fledged
with
the
promise
of
grain
and
here
where
our
graves
will
be
greening
just
smile
and
be
happy
again
and
so
when
the
war
will
be
over
we
seek
for
the
wonderful
one
and
maiden
will
look
for
her
lover
and
mother
will
look
for
her
son
and
there
will
be
end
to
our
grieving
and
gladness
will
gleam
over
loss
as
glory
beyond
all
believing
we
point
to
a
name
on
a
cross

voices

on

plain
all
in
their
blouses
staring
up
at
the
skies
comrades
of
canteen
laughter
dumb
in
the
yellow
wheat
see
how
they
sprawl
and
huddle
see
how
their
brows
are
white
goaded
on
to
the
shambles
there
in
death
and
father
of
pity
hide
them
hasten
o
god
thy
night
the
light
is
waning
only
lilies
you
say
nestling
and
softly
shining
there
where
the
waves
no
my
friend
i
know
better
brighter
i
see
than
day
it
the
poor
little
wooden
crosses
over
their
quiet
graves
oh
how
they
gleaming
gleaming
see
each
cross
has
a
crown
yes
it
true
i
am
dying
little
will
be
the
darkness
but
look
in
heaven
a
light
and
it

going
to
win
a
pot
of
tea
you
make
it
in
your
by
the
brazier
rosy
gleam
you
watch
it
cloud
then
settle
amber
clear
you
lift
it
with
your
and
you
sniff
the
fragrant
steam
the
very
breath
of
it
is
ripe
with
cheer
you
awful
cold
and
dirty
and
of
your
lot
you
scoff
the
blushin
of
it
so
rich
and
rippin
it
bucks
you
up
like
anythink
just
seems
to
touch
the
spot
god
bless
the
man
that
first
discovered
tea
since
i
came
out
to
fight
in
france
which
ai
the
other
day
i
think
i
drunk
enough
to
float
a
barge
all
kinds
of
fancy
foreign
dope
from
caffy
and
doo
lay
to
rum
they
serves
you
out
before
a
charge
in
back
rooms
of
estaminays
i
gurgled
pints
of
cham
i
swilled
down
mugs
of
cider
till
i
felt
a
bloomin
dam
but
they
all
ai
in
it
with
the
vintage
of
assam
god
bless
the
man
that
first
invented
tea
i
think
them
lazy
lumps
o
gods
wot
kips
on
asphodel
swigs
nectar
that
a
flavour
of
oolong
i
only
wish
them
sons
o
guns
down
in
could
their
daily
ration
of
suchong
hurrah
i
off
to
battle
which
is
and
too
and
if
i
do
give
some
poor
bloke
a
sexton
job
to
do
by
fritz
campfire
wo
i
a
gorgeous
brew
for
fightin
must
interfere
with
tea
we
all
be
tellin
of
the
boches
that
we
slew
as
we
drink
the
giddy
victory
in
tea
the
revelation
same
old
sprint
in
the
morning
boys
to
the
same
old
din
and
smut
chained
all
day
to
the
same
old
desk
down
in
the
same
old
rut
posting
the
same
old
greasy
books
catching
the
same
old
train
oh
how
will
i
manage
to
stick
it
all
if
i
ever
get
back
again
we
bidden
to
life
in
a
cage
we
finished
with
pushing
a
pen
they
pumping
us
full
of
bellicose
rage
they
showing
us
how
to
be
men
we
only
beginning
to
find
ourselves
we
wonders
of
brawn
and
thew
but
when
we
go
back
to
our
sissy
jobs
oh
what
are
we
going
to
do
for
shoulders
curved
with
the
counter
stoop
will
be
carried
erect
and
square
and
faces
white
from
the
office
light
will
be
bronzed
by
the
open
air
and
we
walk
with
the
stride
of
a
pride
with
a
joy
in
our
eyes
scornful
men
who
have
diced
with
death
under
the
naked
skies
and
when
we
get
back
to
the
dreary
grind
and
the
boss
call
do
you
think
that
the
dingy
and
the
dingier
office
wall
will
suddenly
melt
to
a
vision
of
space
of
violent
night
then
oh
the
joy
of
the
and
oh
the
roar
of
the
fight
do
you
think
as
we
peddle
a
card
of
pins
the
counter
will
fade
away
and
again
we
be
seeing
the
rims
and
the
misty
grey
as
a
flat
voice
asks
for
a
pound
of
tea
do
you
fancy
we
hear
instead
the
moan
and
the
soothing
drone
of
the
packet
that
overhead
do
you
guess
that
the
things
we
seeing
now
will
haunt
us
through
all
the
years
heaven
and
hell
rolled
into
one
glory
and
blood
and
tears
life
pattern
picked
with
a
scarlet
thread
where
once
we
wove
with
a
grey
to
remind
us
all
how
we
played
our
part
in
the
shock
of
an
epic
day
oh
we
booked
for
the
great
adventure
now
we
pledged
to
the
real
romance
we
find
ourselves
or
we
lose
ourselves
somewhere
in
giddy
old
france
we
know
the
zest
of
the
fighter
life
the
best
that
we
have
we
give
we
hunger
and
thirst
we
die
but
first
we
live
by
the
gods
we
live
we
breathe
free
air
and
we
bivouac
under
the
starry
sky
we
march
with
men
and
we
fight
with
men
and
we
see
men
laugh
and
die
we
know
such
joy
as
we
never
dreamed
we
fathom
the
deeps
of
pain
but
the
hardest
bit
of
it
all
will
be
when
we
come
back
home
again
some
of
us
smirk
in
a
chiffon
shop
and
some
of
us
teach
in
a
school
some
of
us
help
with
the
seat
of
our
pants
to
polish
an
office
stool
the
merits
of
somebody
soap
or
jam
some
of
us
seek
to
explain
but
all
of
us
wonder
what
we
do
when
we
have
to
go
back
and
so
when
he
reached
my
bed
the
general
made
a
stand
my
brave
young
fellow
he
said
i
would
shake
your
hand
so
i
lifted
my
arm
the
right
with
never
a
hand
at
all
only
a
stump
a
sight
fit
to
appal
well
well
now
that
too
bad
that
sorrowful
luck
he
said
but
there
you
give
me
my
lad
the
left
instead
so
from
under
the
blanket
rim
i
raised
and
showed
him
the
other
a
snag
as
ugly
and
grim
as
its
ugly
brother
he
looked
at
each
jagged
wrist
he
looked
but
he
did
not
speak
and
then
he
bent
down
and
kissed
me
on
either
cheek
you
wonder
now
i
do
mind
i
had
a
hand
to
they
tell
me
you
know
i
blind
son
he
hurried
away
young
heart
of
joy
under
our
devon
sky
and
i
watched
him
go
my
beautiful
boy
and
a
weary
woman
was
i
for
my
hair
is
grey
and
his
was
gold
he
the
best
of
his
life
to
live
and
i
loved
him
so
and
i
old
i
old
and
he
all
i
had
to
give
ah
yes
he
was
proud
and
swift
and
gay
but
oh
how
my
eyes
were
dim
with
the
sun
in
his
heart
he
went
away
but
he
took
the
sun
with
him
for
look
how
the
leaves
are
falling
now
and
the
winter
wo
be
oh
boy
my
boy
with
the
sunny
brow
and
the
lips
of
love
and
of
song
how
we
used
to
sit
at
the
day
sweet
end
we
two
by
the
firelight
gleam
and
we
drift
to
the
valley
of
let
pretend
on
the
beautiful
river
of
dream
oh
dear
little
heart
all
wealth
untold
would
i
gladly
gladly
pay
could
i
just
for
a
moment
closely
hold
that
golden
head
to
my
grey
for
i
gaze
in
the
fire
and
i
seeing
there
a
child
and
he
waves
to
me
and
i
run
and
i
hold
him
up
in
the
air
and
he
laughs
and
shouts
with
glee
a
little
bundle
of
love
and
mirth
crying
come
mumsie
dear
ah
me
if
he
called
from
the
ends
of
the
earth
i
know
that
my
heart
would
yet
the
thought
comes
thrilling
through
all
my
pain
how
worthier
could
he
die
yea
a
loss
like
that
is
a
glorious
gain
and
pitiful
proud
am
i
for
peace
must
be
bought
with
blood
and
tears
and
the
boys
of
our
hearts
must
pay
and
so
in
our
joy
of
the
let
us
bless
them
every
day
and
though
i
know
there
a
hasty
grave
with
a
poor
little
cross
at
its
head
and
the
gold
of
his
youth
he
so
gladly
gave
yet
to
me
he
never
be
dead
and
the
sun
in
my
devon
lane
will
be
gay
and
my
boy
will
be
with
me
still
so
i
finding
the
heart
to
smile
and
say
oh
god
if
it
be
thy
will
the
black
dudeen
it
here
in
the
sucking
me
black
dudeen
i
like
to
say
in
a
general
way
there
nothing
like
nickyteen
there
nothing
like
nickyteen
me
boys
be
it
pipes
or
snipes
or
cigars
so
be
sure
that
a
bloke
has
plenty
to
smoke
if
you
wants
him
to
fight
your
when
i
eat
my
fill
and
my
belt
is
snug
i
begin
to
think
of
my
baccy
plug
i
whittle
a
fill
in
my
horny
palm
and
the
bowl
of
me
old
clay
pipe
i
cram
i
trim
the
edges
i
tamp
it
down
i
nurse
a
light
with
an
anxious
frown
i
begin
to
draw
and
my
cheeks
tuck
in
and
all
my
face
is
a
blissful
grin
and
up
in
a
cloud
the
good
smoke
goes
and
the
good
pipe
glimmers
and
fades
and
glows
in
its
throat
it
chuckles
a
cheery
song
for
i
likes
it
hot
and
i
likes
it
strong
oh
it
good
is
grub
when
you
feeling
hollow
but
the
best
of
a
meal
the
smoke
to
follow
there
was
micky
and
me
on
a
night
patrol
having
to
hide
in
a
hole
and
sure
i
thought
i
was
worse
than
dead
wi
them
hustlin
over
me
head
sure
i
thought
was
the
dirty
spot
hammer
and
tongs
till
the
air
was
hot
and
mind
you
water
up
to
your
knees
and
cold
a
monkey
of
brass
would
freeze
and
if
we
ventured
our
noses
out
a
typewriter
clattered
its
pills
about
the
field
of
glory
well
i
do
think
i
sooner
be
safe
and
snug
in
clink
then
micky
he
goes
and
he
cops
one
bad
he
always
was
having
poor
lad
says
he
old
chummy
i
booked
right
through
death
and
me
a
wrongday
voo
but
you
got
a
pinch
of
shag
i
sell
me
perishin
soul
for
a
fag
and
there
he
shivered
and
cussed
his
luck
so
i
gave
him
me
old
black
pipe
to
suck
and
he
heaves
a
sigh
and
he
takes
to
it
like
a
babby
takes
to
his
mammy
tit
like
an
infant
takes
to
his
mother
breast
poor
little
micky
he
went
to
rest
but
the
dawn
was
near
though
the
night
was
black
so
i
left
him
there
and
i
started
back
and
i
laughed
as
the
silly
old
bullets
came
for
the
bullet
ai
made
wot
got
me
name
yet
some
of
buzzed
onhealthily
near
and
one
little
blighter
just
chipped
me
ear
but
there
i
got
to
the
trench
all
right
when
sudden
i
jumped
wi
a
start
o
fright
and
a
word
that
does
look
well
in
type
clean
forgotten
me
old
clay
so
i
had
to
do
it
all
over
again
crawling
out
on
that
filthy
plain
through
shells
and
bombs
and
bullets
and
all
only
this
time
i
do
not
crawl
i
run
like
a
man
wot
missing
a
train
or
a
caught
in
a
plump
of
rain
i
hear
the
spit
of
a
gun
tickle
my
heels
but
i
run
i
run
through
crash
and
crackle
and
flicker
and
flame
oh
the
packet
ai
issued
wot
got
me
name
i
run
like
a
man
that
no
ideer
of
hunting
around
for
a
sooveneer
i
run
bang
into
a
german
chap
and
he
stares
like
an
owl
so
i
bash
his
map
and
just
to
show
him
that
i
his
boss
i
gives
him
a
kick
on
the
parados
and
i
marches
him
back
with
me
all
serene
with
in
me
gub
me
old
here
in
the
trenches
me
heart
with
spleen
for
a
parcel
o
lead
comes
missing
me
head
but
it
smashes
me
old
dudeen
god
blast
that
sniper
i
give
him
somethin
to
snipe
before
the
war
through
just
see
how
i
do
that
blighter
that
smashed
me
the
little
the
french
tommy
oh
some
of
us
lolled
in
the
chateau
and
some
of
us
slinked
in
the
slum
but
now
we
are
here
with
a
song
and
a
cheer
to
serve
at
the
sign
of
the
drum
they
put
us
in
trousers
of
scarlet
in
big
sloppy
ulsters
of
blue
in
boots
that
are
flat
a
box
of
a
hat
and
they
call
us
the
little
the
laughing
and
quaffing
the
swinging
and
singing
and
so
with
a
rattle
we
march
to
the
battle
the
weary
but
cheery
un
petit
verre
de
vin
pour
nous
mettre
en
route
encore
un
petit

pour
nous
mettre
en
they
drive
us
for
the
slaughter
we
have
got
much
of
a
chance
the
issue
looks
bad
but
we
awfully
glad
to
battle
and
die
for
la
france
for
some
must
be
killed
that
is
certain
there
only
one
duty
to
do
so
we
leap
to
the
fray
in
the
glorious
way
they
expect
of
the
little
en
avant
the
way
of
the
gallant
the
dashing
and
smashing
the
way
grim
and
gory
that
leads
us
to
glory
is
the
way
of
the
little
enfants

la
patrie

you
would
scarce
recognise
us
such
veterans
are
we
so
grimy
and
hard
so
calloused
and
scarred
so
crummy
yet
gay
as
can
be
we
finished
with
trousers
of
scarlet
they
giving
us
breeches
of
blue
with
a
helmet
instead
of
a
cap
on
our
head
yet
still
we
the
little

the
jesting
unresting
the
cheering
unfearing
the
and
the
dying
defying
la
bayonette
la
mort
sonnez
la
charge
clairons
bill
the
bomber
the
poppies
gleamed
like
bloody
pools
through
mist
the
captain
kept
at
the
watch
upon
his
wrist
and
there
we
smoked
and
squatted
as
we
watched
the
shrapnel
flame
was
wonnerful
i
tellin
you
how
fast
them
bullets
came
was
weary
work
the
waiting
though
i
tried
to
sleep
a
wink
for
waitin
means
and
it
does
do
to
think
so
i
closed
my
eyes
a
little
and
i
had
a
niceish
dream
of
by
a
dresser
with
a
dish
of
devon
cream
but
i
had
time
to
sample
it
for
suddenlike
i
woke
come
on
me
lads
the
captain
says
i
climbed
out
through
the
smoke
we
spread
out
in
the
open
it
was
like
a
bath
of
lead
but
the
boys
they
cheered
and
hollered
fit
to
raise
the
bloody
dead
till
a
beastly
bullet
copped
then
they
lay
without
a
sound
and
it
odd
we
did
seem
to
heed
them
corpses
on
the
ground
and
i
kept
on
thinkin
thinkin
as
the
bullets
faster
flew
how
they
picks
the
werry
best
men
and
they
lets
the
rotters
through
so
indiscriminatin
like
they
spares
a
man
of
sin
and
a
rare
lad
wot
a
husband
and
a
father
gets
done
in
and
while
havin
these
reflections
and
advancin
on
the
run
a
bullet
biffs
me
shoulder
and
says
i
that
number
one
well
it
downed
me
for
a
jiffy
but
i
did
lose
me
calm
for
i
knew
that
i
was
needed
i
a
bomber
so
i
am
i
lost
me
cap
and
rifle
but
i
carried
on
because
i
me
bombs
and
knew
that
they
was
needed
so
they
was
we
did
no
singin
now
nor
many
men
to
cheer
maybe
the
shrapnel
drowned
crashin
out
so
werry
near
and
the
maxims
got
us
sideways
and
the
bullets
faster
flew
and
i
copped
one
on
me
flipper
and
says
i
that
number
two
i
was
pleased
it
was
the
left
one
for
i
me
bombs
ye
see
and
was
if
they
be
wasted
like
and
all
along
o
me
and
i
lost
me
and
rifle
but
i
told
you
that
before
so
i
packed
me
mit
inside
me
coat
and
carried
on
once
more
but
the
rumpus
it
was
wicked
and
the
men
were
scarcer
yet
and
i
felt
me
ginger
goin
but
me
jaws
i
kindo
set
and
we
passed
the
boche
first
trenches
which
was
with
dead
and
we
started
for
their
second
which
was
fifty
feet
ahead
when
something
like
a
smashed
me
savage
on
the
knee
and
down
i
came
all
muck
and
blood
says
i
that
number
three
so
there
i
lay
all
like
and
bloody
sick
at
that
and
worryin
like
anythink
because
i
lost
me
and
thinkin
of
me
missis
and
the
partin
words
she
said
if
you
gets
killed
write
quick
ol
man
and
tell
me
as
you
dead
and
lookin
at
me
bunch
o
bombs
that
was
the
blow
to
think
i
never
the
chance
to
them
at
the
foe
and
there
was
all
our
boys
in
front
there
like
mad
and
me
as
could
wiv
the
lovely
bombs
i
and
so
i
cussed
and
cussed
and
then
i
struggled
back
again
into
that
bit
of
battered
trench
packed
solid
with
its
slain
now
as
i
lay
there
and
blastin
of
me
lot
and
wishin
i
could
just
dispose
of
all
them
bombs
i
got
i
sees
within
the
doorway
of
a
shy
retirin
six
boches
all
and
their
captain
stuck
mug
out
and
they
a
nice
machine
gun
and
i
twigged
what
they
was
at
and
they
fixed
it
on
a
tripod
and
i
watched
like
a
cat
and
they
got
it
in
position
and
they
seemed
so
werry
glad
like
they
got
us
in
a
which
condemn
their
souls
they
for
there
our
boys
was
fightin
fifty
yards
in
front
and
this
lousy
bunch
of
boches
they
got
us
in
the
rear
oh
it
set
me
blood
and
i
quite
forgot
me
pain
so
i
started
crawlin
crawlin
over
all
them
mounds
of
slain
and
them
barstards
was
so
they
no
eyes
for
me
and
me
bleedin
leg
was
draggin
but
me
right
arm
it
was
and
now
they
it
all
in
shape
and
swingin
sweet
and
clear
and
now
they
all
excited
like
but
i
am
drawin
near
and
now
they
it
loaded
up
and
now
they
takin
oh
here
says
i
is
where
i
join
the
game
and
my
right
arm
it
goes
swingin
and
a
bomb
it
goes
and
that
typewriter
goes
wingin
in
a
thunderbolt
of
flame
then
these
boches
wot
was
left
of
they
tumbled
down
their
and
up
i
climbed
a
mound
of
dead
and
down
on
them
i
stole
and
oh
that
blessed
moment
when
i
heard
their
frightened
yell
and
i
laughed
down
in
that
ere
i
bombed
their
souls
to
hell
and
now
i
in
the
hospital
surprised
that
i
alive
we
started
out
a
thousand
men
we
came
back
and
i
minus
of
a
trotter
but
i
most
amazin
gay
for
me

was
wasted

talk
o
your

sandy
at
eepers
i
mind
me
when
rank
upon
rank
we
rose
from
the
trenches
and
swept
like
the
gale
till
the
guns
got
us
fell
on
the
flank
and
the
murderin
bullets
came
swishin
like
hail
till
a
that
were
left
o
us
faltered
and
broke
till
it
seemed
for
a
moment
a
panicky
rout
when
shrill
through
the
fume
and
the
flash
and
the
smoke
the
wee
valiant
voice
o
a
whistle
piped
out
campbells
are
comin
then
into
the
fray
we
bounded
wi
bayonets
reekin
and
raw
and
oh
we
fair
revelled
in
glory
that
day
jist
thanks
to
the
whistle
o
sandy
at
loose
it
wis
after
a
sconnersome
fecht
on
the
field
o
the
slain
i
wis
crawlin
aboot
and
the
rockets
were
burnin
red
holes
in
the
nicht
and
the
guns
they
were
veciously
thunderin
oot
when
sudden
i
heard
a
bit
sound
like
a
sigh
and

big
stuff

gorin
and
roarin
around
and
i
seemed
tae
be
under
the
oxter
o
hell
and
creation

crackin
tae
bits
by
the
sound
and
i
says
in
ma
mind

ye
back
ye
auld
fule
when
i
thrilled
tae
a
note
that

saucy
and
sma

in
a
crater
collected
and
cool
wi
his
wee
penny
whistle
wis
sandy

fray
wee
sandy
wis
playin
watch
on
the
the
last
scene
o
a
was
the
day
that
we
took
that
bit
o
black
ruin
they
ca
labbiesell
it
seemed
the
hale
hillside
jist
shivered
and
shook
and
the
red
skies
were
roarin
and
spewin
oot
shell
and
the
sergeants
were
cursin
tae
keep
us
in
hand
and
hard
on
the
leash
we
were
strainin
like
dugs
when
upward
we
shot
at
the
word
o
command
and
the
bullets
were
dingin
their
songs
in
oor
lugs
and
onward
we
swept
wi
a
yell
and
a
cheer
and
a
wis
destruction
confusion
and
din
and
we
knew
that
the
trench
o
the
boches
wis
near
and
it
seemed
jist
the
safest
bit
hole
tae
be
in
so
we
a
tumbled
doon
and
the
boches
were
there
and
they
held
up
their
hands
and
they
yelled
kamarad
and
i
merched
aff
wi
ten
wi
their
palms
in
the
air
and
my
i
wis
and
my
i
wis
glad
and
i
thocht
if
ma
lassie
could
see
me
jist
when
sudden
i
sobered
at
somethin
i
saw
and
i
stopped
and
i
stared
and
i
halted
ma
men
for
there
on
a
stretcher
wis
sandy
mcgraw
weel
he
looks
in
ma
face
jist
as
game
as
ye
please
ye
ken

i
hate
tae
be
workin
says
he
but
noo
i
can
play
in
the
street
for
bawbees
wi
baith
o
ma
legs
taken
aff
at
the
knee
and
though
i
could
see
he
wis
rackit
wi
pain
he
reached
for
his
whistle
and
stertit
tae
play
and
quaverin
sweet
wis
the
pensive
refrain
floors
o
the
forest
are
a
wede
away
then
sudden
he
stoppit
man
wis
it
no
grand
hoo
we
took
a
them
trenches
he
shakit
his
heid
i
no
play
nae
mair
feebly
doon
frae
his
hand
slipped
the
wee
penny
whistle
and
wis
and
so
you
may
talk
o
your
steinways
and
strads
your
wonderful
organs
and
brasses
sae
braw
but
oot
in
the
trenches
jist
gie
me
ma
lads
yon
wee
penny
whistle
o
sandy
mcgraw
the
my
stretcher
is
one
scarlet
stain
and
as
i
tries
to
scrape
it
clean
i
tell
you
wot
i
sick
with
pain
for
all
i
for
all
i
seen
around
me
is
the
night
and
as
the
war
red
rim
i
trace
i
wonder
if
in
height
our
god
do
turn
away
face
i
do
care
the
crime
may
be
i
no
brief
for
kin
or
clan
i
no
i
only
see
as
man
destroys
his
brother
man
i
waves
no
flag
i
only
know
as
beside
the
dead
i
wait
a
million
is
weighed
with
woe
a
million
is
desolate
in
drippin
darkness
far
and
near
all
night
i
sought
them
woeful
ones
dawn
shudders
up
and
still
i
the
crimson
chorus
of
the
guns
look
like
a
ball
of
blood
the
sun
the
scene
of
wrath
and
quick
on
the
run
prince
of
peace
long
long
wounded
is
it
not
strange
a
year
ago
with
scarce
a
thought
beyond
the
round
i
did
my
decent
job
and
earned
my
pay
was
averagely
happy
i
be
bound
ay
in
my
little
groove
i
was
content
seeing
my
life
run
smoothly
to
the
end
with
prosy
days
in
stolid
labour
spent
and
jolly
nights
a
pipe
a
glass
a
friend
in
god
good
time
a
hearth
fire
cosy
gleam
a
wife
and
kids
and
all
a
fellow
needs
when
presto
like
a
bubble
goes
my
dream
i
leap
upon
the
stage
of
splendid
deeds
i
yell
with
rage
i
wallow
deep
in
gore
i
that
was
clerk
in
a
drysalter
store
stranger
than
any
book
i
ever
read
here
on
the
reeking
battlefield
i
lie
under
the
stars
propped
up
with
smeary
dead
like
too
if
no
one
takes
me
in
to
die
hit
on
the
arms
legs
liver
lungs
and
gall
damn
glad
there
nothing
more
of
me
to
hit
but
calm
and
feeling
never
pain
at
all
and
full
of
wonder
at
the
turn
of
it
for
of
the
dead
around
me
three
are
mine
three
foemen
vanquished
in
the
whirl
of
fight
so
if
i
die
i
have
no
right
to
whine
i
feel
i
done
my
little
bit
all
right
i
do
know
how
but
there
the
beggars
are
as
dead
as
herrings
pickled
in
a
jar
and
here
am
i
worse
wounded
than
i
thought
for
in
the
fight
a
bullet
stings
you
never
heed
the
air
is
and
all
alive
with
little
flicking
wings
on
you
you
see
the
fellows
fall
your
pal
was
by
your
side
fair
you
turn
to
him
and
lo
no
pal
at
all
you
wonder
vaguely
if
he
copped
it
bad
on
you
the
heavens
vomit
death
and
vicious
death
is
besoming
the
ground
you
blind
with
sweat
you
dazed
and
out
of
breath
and
though
you
yell
you
can
not
hear
a
sound
on
you
oh
war
a
rousing
game
around
you
smoky
clouds
like
ogres
tower
the
earth
is
rowelled
deep
with
spurs
of
flame
and
on
your
helmet
stones
and
ashes
shower
on
you
it
odd
you
have
no
fear
bullets
whip
and
lash
your
path
red
yellow
black
the
smoky
giants
rear
the
shrapnel
rips
the
heavens
roar
in
wrath
on
you
barbed
wire
all
trampled
down
the
ground
all
gored
and
rent
as
by
a
blast
grim
heaps
of
grey
where
once
were
heaps
of
brown
a
ragged
ditch
the
hun
first
line
at
last
all
smashed
to
hell
their
second
right
ahead
on
you
there
nothing
else
to
do
more
reeking
holes
blood
barbed
wire
gruesome
dead
your
puttee
strap
undone
that
worries
you
you
glare
around
you
think
you
all
alone
but
no
your
chums
come
surging
left
and
right
the
nearest
chap
flops
down
without
a
groan
his
face
still
snarling
with
the
rage
of
fight
ha
here
the
second
trench
just
like
the
first
only
a
little
more
so
more
laid
out
more
pounded
a
pretty
piece
of
work
beyond
a
doubt
now
for
the
third
and
there
your
job
is
done
on
you
you
never
stop
to
think
your
cursed
puttee
trailing
as
you
run
you
feel
you
sell
your
soul
to
have
a
drink
the
acrid
air
is
full
of
cracking
whips
you
wonder
how
it
is
you
going
still
you
foam
with
rage
oh
god
to
be
at
grips
with
someone
you
can
rush
and
crush
and
kill
your
sleeve
is
dripping
blood
you
seeing
red
you
your
turn
is
coming
now
see
there
the
jagged
barbed
wire
straight
ahead
and
there
the
trench
you
get
there
anyhow
your
puttee
catches
on
a
strand
of
wire
and
down
you
go
perhaps
it
saves
your
life
for
over
sandbag
rims
you
see
fire
chaps
their
eyes
ablaze
with
strife
you
crawl
you
cower
then
once
again
you
plunge
with
all
your
comrades
roaring
at
your
heels
at
lads
you
stab
you
jab
you
lunge
a
blaze
of
glory
then
the
red
world
reels
a
crash
of
triumph
then
you
faint
a
bit
that
cursed
puttee
now
to
fasten
well
that
the
charge
and
now
i
here
alone
i
built
a
little
wall
of
hun
on
hun
to
shield
me
from
the
leaden
bees
that
drone
it
saves
me
worry
and
it
hurts
none
the
only
thing
i
wondering
is
when
some
will
stroll
along
my
way
it
is
much
that
left
of
me
but
then
where
life
is
hope
is
so
at
least
they
say
well
if
i
spared
i
be
the
happy
lad
i
tell
you
i
wo
envy
any
king
i
stood
the
racket
and
i
proud
and
glad
i
had
my
crowning
hour
oh
war
the
thing
it
gives
us
common
working
chaps
our
chance
a
taste
of
glory
chivalry
romance
ay
war
they
say
is
hell
it
heaven
too
it
lets
a
man
discover
what
he
worth
it
takes
his
measure
shows
what
he
can
do
gives
him
a
joy
like
nothing
else
on
earth
it
fans
in
him
a
flame
that
otherwise
would
flicker
out
these
drab
discordant
days
it
teaches
him
in
pain
and
sacrifice
faith
fortitude
grim
courage
past
all
praise
yes
war
is
good
so
here
beside
my
slain
a
happy
wreck
i
wait
amid
the
din
for
even
if
i
perish
mine
the
hi
there
you
fellows
wo
you
take
me
in
give
me
a
fag
to
smoke
upon
the
we
taken
la
boiselle
the
hell
you
say
well
that
would
make
a
corpse
sit
up
and
lead
on
i
live
to
fight
another
day
faith
since
all
that
is
was
ever
bound
to
be
since
grim
eternal
laws
our
being
bind
and
both
the
riddle
and
the
answer
find
and
both
the
carnage
and
the
calm
decree
since
plain
within
the
book
of
destiny
is
written
all
the
journey
of
mankind
inexorably
to
the
end
since
blind
and
mortal
puppets
playing
parts
are
we
then
let
have
faith
good
cometh
out
of
ill
the
power
that
shaped
the
strife
shall
end
the
strife
then
let
bow
down
before
the
unknown
will
fight
on
believing
all
is
well
with
life
seeing
within
the
worst
of
war
red
rage
the
gleam
the
glory
of
the
golden
age

sparks
from
brands

friends

our
gutters
running
red
bright
with
blood
your
friends
have
shed
hark
amid
your
drunken
brawl
how
our
maidens

and
call
why

here
alone
to
this
hearth
stone

and
no
there
i
done
it
see
he
lies
death
from
his
eyes
glazing
eyeballs
panting
breath
how
it
horrible
is
death
plucking
at
his
bloody
lips
with
his
trembling
choking
in
a
dreadful
way
as
if
he
would
something
say
in
that
uncouth
tongue
of
oh
how
horrible
death
is
how
i
wish
that
he
would
die
so
unnerved
unmanned
am
i
see
his
twitching
face
is
white
see
his
bubbling
blood
is
bright
why
do
i
not
shout
with
glee
what
strange
spell
is
over
me
there
he
lies
the
fight
was
fair
let
me
toss
my
cap
in
air
why
am
i
so
silent
why
do
i
pray
for
him
to
die
where
is
all
my
vengeful
joy
ugh
foe
is
but
a
i
a
brother
of
his
age
perished
in
the
war
red
rage
perished
in
the
ypres
hell
oh
i
loved
my
brother
well
and
though
i
be
hard
and
grim
how
it
makes
me
think
of
him
he
had
just
such
flaxen
hair
as
the
lad
that
lying
there
just
such
frank
blue
eyes
were
god
how
horrible
war
is
i
have
reason
to
be
gay
there
is
one
less
foe
to
slay
i
have
reason
to
be
glad
yet
my
foe
is
such
a
lad
so
i
watch
in
dull
amaze
see
his
dying
eyes
see
his
face
grow
glorified
see
his
hands
outstretched
and
wide
to
that
bit
of
ruined
wall
where
the
flames
have
ceased
to
crawl
where
amid
the
crumbling
bricks
hangs
blackened
now
oh
now
i
understand
quick
i
press
it
in
his
hand
close
his
feeble
hold
it
to
his
faltering
lips
as
i
watch
his
welling
blood
i
would
stem
it
if
i
could
god
of
pity
let
him
live
god
of
love
forgive
his
face
looked
strangely
as
he
died
like
that
of
one
they
crucified
and
in
the
pocket
of
his
coat
i
found
a
letter
thus
he
wrote
things
i
seen
oh
mother
dear
i
wondering
can
god
be
here
amid
the
drunken
brawl
i
saw
a
cross
hung
on
a
wall
i
seek
it
now
and
there
alone
perhaps
i
may
atone
ah
no
is
i
who
must
atone
no
other
saw
but
god
alone
yet
how
can
i
forget
the
sight
of
that
face
so
woeful
white
dead
i
kissed
him
as
he
lay
knelt
by
him
and
tried
to
pray
left
him
lying
there
at
rest
crucifix
upon
his
breast
not
for
him
the
pity
be
ye
who
pity
pity
me
crawling
now
the
ways
i
trod
in
sight
of
god

job

a
little
job

to
the
eye
and
i
the
god
of
soldier
men

because

i
never

and
till
you

noo
stunts

always
tryin
the
chances

i
never

a
little
note
to

much
good
at
writin
notes
but
here
goes
dearest
mother
i
been
in
many
old
i
scraped
through
safe
but
now
i
on
the
very
point
of
tacklin
another
a
little
job
of
they
called
for
volunteers
they
picked
me
out
i
proud
of
it
it
seems
a
trifle
dicky
if
anythin
should
well
there
ai
no
call
for
tears
and
so
i
this
finds
you
your
werry
lovin
micky
i
got
a
little
score
to
settle
wiv
them
swine
out
there
i
so
many
of
me
pals
done
in
it
quite
upset
me
i
seen
so
much
of
bloody
death
i
do
seem
for
to
care
if
i
can
only
even
up
how
soon
the
blighters
get
me
i
sorry
for
them
perishers
that
corpses
in
a
bed
i
only
mine
short
and
sweet
no
i
made
a
mess
of
life
but
now
i
try
to
make
instead
it
seven
sharp
old
pals
decent
job
in
the
song
of
the
pacifist
what
do
they
matter
our
headlong
hates
when
we
take
the
toll
of
our
dead
think
ye
our
glory
and
gain
will
pay
for
the
torrent
of
blood
we
have
shed
by
the
cheers
of
our
victory
will
the
heart
of
the
mother
be
comforted
if
by
the
victory
all
we
mean
is
a
broken
and
brooding
foe
is
the
pomp
and
power
of
a
hour
and
a
truce
for
an
age
or
so
by
the
hand
on
the
broken
blade
we
have
smitten
a
bootless
blow
if
by
the
triumph
we
only
prove
that
the
sword
we
sheathe
is
bright
that
justice
and
truth
and
love
endure
that
freedom
throned
on
the
height
that
the
feebler
folks
shall
be
unafraid
that
might
shall
never
be
right
if
this
be
all
by
the
plains
by
the
havoc
of
fire
and
fear
by
the
rending
roar
of
the
war
of
wars
by
the
dead
so
doubly
then
our
victory
is
a
vast
defeat
and
it
mocks
us
as
we
cheer
victory
there
can
be
but
one
hallowed
in
every
land
when
by
the
graves
of
our
common
dead
we
who
were
foemen
stand
and
in
the
hush
of
our
common
grief
hand
is
tendered
to
hand
triumph
yes
when
out
of
the
dust
in
the
splendour
of
their
release
the
spirits
of
those
who
fell
go
forth
and
they
hallow
our
hearts
to
peace
and
brothers
in
pain
with
voice
we
clamour
that
war
shall
cease
glory
ay
when
from
blackest
loss
shall
be
born
most
radiant
gain
when
over
the
gory
fields
shall
rise
a
star
that
never
shall
wane
then
and
then
only
our
dead
shall
know
that
they
have
not
in
vain
when
our
children
children
shall
talk
of
war
as
a
madness
that
may
not
be
when
we
thank
our
god
for
our
grief
and
blazon
from
sea
to
sea
in
the
name
of
the
dead
the
banner
of
peace
will
be
the
twins
there
were
two
brothers
john
and
james
and
when
the
town
went
up
in
flames
to
save
the
house
of
james
dashed
john
then
turned
and
lo
his
own
was
gone
and
when
the
great
world
war
began
to
volunteer
john
promptly
ran
and
while
he
learned
live
bombs
to
lob
james
stayed
at
home
and
sneaked
his
job
john
came
home
with
a
missing
limb
that
did
seem
to
worry
him
but
oh
it
set
his
brain
awhirl
to
find
that
james
had
sneaked
his
girl
time
passed
john
tried
his
grief
to
drown
james
owns
the
town
his
army
contracts
riches
yield
and
john
well
the
potter
the
song
of
the
me
the
scorn
of
the
stars
and
a
peak
defiant
wail
of
the
pines
and
a
wind
with
the
shout
of
a
giant
night
and
a
trail
unknown
and
a
heart
give
me
to
live
and
love
in
the
old
bold
fashion
a
soldier
billet
at
night
and
a
soldier
ration
a
heart
that
leaps
to
the
fight
with
a
soldier
passion
for
i
hold
as
a
simple
faith
there
no
denying
the
trade
of
a
soldier
the
only
trade
worth
plying
the
death
of
a
soldier
the
only
death
worth
dying
so
let
me
go
and
leave
your
safety
behind
me
go
to
the
spaces
of
hazard
where
nothing
shall
bind
me
go
till
the
word
is
war
and
then
you
will
find
me
then
you
will
call
me
and
claim
me
because
you
will
need
me
cheer
me
and
gird
me
and
into
the
speed
and
when
it
over
spurn
me
and
no
longer
heed
me
for
guile
and
a
purse
are
the
arms
you
carry
with
deeds
of
paper
you
fight
and
with
pens
you
parry
you
call
on
the
hounds
of
the
law
your
foes
to
harry
you
with
your
art
for
its
own
sake
posing
and
prinking
you
with
your
live
and
be
merry
eating
and
drinking
you
with
your
peace
at
all
hazard
from
bright
blood
shrinking
fools
i
will
tell
you
now
though
the
red
rain
patters
and
a
million
of
men
go
down
it
little
it
there
the
flag
upflung
to
the
stars
though
it
streams
in
tatters
there
a
glory
gold
never
can
buy
to
yearn
and
to
cry
for
there
a
hope
that
as
old
as
the
sky
to
suffer
and
sigh
for
there
a
faith
that
the
sun
to
martyr
and
die
for
ah
no
it
my
dream
that
war
will
never
be
ended
that
men
will
perish
like
men
and
valour
be
splendid
that
the
flag
by
the
sword
will
be
served
and
honour
defended
that
the
tale
of
my
fights
will
never
be
ancient
story
that
though
my
eye
may
be
dim
and
my
beard
be
hoary
i
die
as
a
soldier
dies
on
the
field
of
glory
give
me
a
strong
right
arm
for
a
wrong
swift
righting
stave
of
a
song
on
my
lips
as
my
sword
is
smiting
death
in
my
boots
but
fighting
afternoon
tea
as
i
was
saying
no
thank
you
i
never
take
cream
with
my
tea
cows
were
allowed
in
the
trenches
got
out
of
the
habit
as
i
was
saying
our
colonel
leaped
up
like
a
youngster
of
ten
come
on
lads
he
shouts
and
we
show
and
he
sprang
to
the
head
of
the
men
then
some
bally
thing
seemed
to
trip
him
and
he
fell
on
his
face
with
a
oh
he
died
like
a
true
british
soldier
and
the
last
word
he
uttered
was
damn
and
hang
it
i
loved
the
old
fellow
and
something
just
burst
in
my
brain
and
i
cared
no
more
for
the
bullets
than
i
would
for
a
shower
of
rain
was
an
funny
sensation
i
say
this
is
jolly
nice
tea
i
felt
as
if
something
had
broken
by
gad
i
was
suddenly
free
free
for
a
glorified
moment
beyond
regulations
and
laws
free
just
to
wallow
in
slaughter
as
the
chap
of
the
stone
age
was
so
on
i
went
joyously
nursing
a
berserker
rage
of
my
own
and
though
all
my
chaps
were
behind
me
feeling
most
alone
with
the
bullets
and
shells
and
the
krock
and
the
swish
of
the
shrap
and
i
found
myself
humming
ben
bolt
will
you
pass
me
the
sugar
old
chap
two
lumps
please
what
was
i
saying
oh
yes
the
jolly
old
dash
we
simply
ripped
through
the
barrage
and
on
with
a
roar
and
a
crash
my
fellows
old
nick
could
stop
on
on
they
went
with
a
yell
till
they
tripped
on
the
boches
nothing
much
left
to
tell
a
trench
so
tattered
and
battered
that
even
a
rat
could
live
some
corpses
tangled
and
mangled
wire
you
could
pass
through
a
sieve
the
jolly
old
guns
had
bilked
us
cheated
us
out
of
our
show
and
my
fellows
were
simply
yearning
for
a
red
with
the
foe
so
i
shouted
to
them
to
follow
and
on
we
went
roaring
again
and
exultant
on
in
the
leaden
rain
then
all
at
once
a
machine
gun
barks
from
a
bit
of
a
bank
and
our
major
roars
in
a
fury
we
got
to
take
it
on
flank
he
was
running
like
fire
to
lead
us
when
down
like
a
stone
he
comes
as
full
of
typewriter
bullets
as
a
pudding
is
full
of
plums
so
i
took
his
job
and
we
got
by
gad
we
got
like
rats
down
in
a
deep
we
fought
like
kilkenny
cats
was
pleasant
just
for
a
moment
to
be
sheltered
and
out
of
range
with
someone
you
to
go
for
it
made
an
agreeable
change
and
the
boches
that
missed
my
bullets
my
chaps
gave
a
bayonet
jolt
and
all
the
time
i
remember
i
whistled
and
hummed
ben
bolt
well
that
little
job
was
over
so
hell
for
leather
we
ran
on
to
the
second
line
trenches
that
where
the
fun
began
for
though
we
had
strafed
like
fury
there
still
were
some
boches
about
and
my
fellows
teeth
set
and
eyes
glaring
like
terriers
routed
out
then
i
stumbled
on
one
of
their
and
i
shouted
is
anyone
there
and
a
voice
yes
one
but
i
wounded
came
faint
up
the
narrow
stair
and
my
man
was
descending
before
me
when
sudden
a
cry
a
shot
i
say
this
cake
is
delicious
you
make
it
yourself
do
you
not
my
man
oh
they
killed
the
poor
devil
for
if
there
was
one
there
was
ten
so
after
i
bombed
sufficient
i
went
down
at
the
head
of
my
men
and
four
tried
to
sneak
from
a
but
we
cornered
the
rotters
all
right
i
rather
not
go
into
details
was
messy
that
bit
of
the
fight
but
all
of
it
beastly
messy
let
talk
of
pleasanter
things
the
skirts
that
the
girls
are
wearing
ridiculous
fluffy
things
so
short
that
they
oh
hang
it
well
if
i
must
i
must
we
cleaned
out
the
second
trench
line
bomb
and
bayonet
thrust
and
on
we
went
to
the
third
one
quite
calloused
to
crumping
by
now
and
some
of
our
fellows
who
passed
us
were
making
a
deuce
of
a
row
and
my
chaps
well
i
just
could
hold
it
strange
how
it
is
with
gore
in
some
ways
it
just
like
whiskey
if
you
taste
it
you
must
have
more
their
eyes
were
like
beacons
of
battle
by
gad
sir
they
be
calmed
so
i
headed
bang
for
the
racing
like
oh
it
did
take
long
to
arrive
there
those
who
arrived
at
all
the
machine
guns
were
certainly
chronic
the
shindy
enough
to
appal
oh
yes
i
omitted
to
tell
you
i
wounds
on
the
chest
and
the
head
and
my
shirt
was
torn
to
a
and
my
face
and
red
i
thinking
i
looked
like
a
madman
i
fancy
i
felt
one
too
half
naked
and
swinging
a
god
what
a
glorious
do
as
i
sit
here
in
old
piccadilly
sipping
my
afternoon
tea
i
see
a
blind
devil
and
it
hard
to
believe
that
it
me
i
see
a
wild
demon
smashing
out
left
and
right
and
humming
ben
bolt
rather
loudly
and
hugely
enjoying
the
fight
and
as
for
my
men
may
god
bless
i
loved
ever
since
then
they
fought
like
the
shining
angels
they
the
pick
o
the
land
my
men
and
the
trench
was
a
reeking
shambles
not
a
boche
to
be
seen
alive
so
i
thought
but
on
rounding
a
traverse
i
came
on
a
covey
of
five
and
four
of
threw
up
their
flippers
but
the
fifth
chap
a
sergeant
was
game
and
though
i
a
bomb
and
revolver
he
came
at
me
just
the
same
a
sporty
thing
that
i
tell
you
i
just
could
blow
him
to
hell
so
i
swung
to
the
point
of
his
and
down
like
a
ninepin
he
fell
and
then
when
i
brought
him
to
reason
he
was
half
bad
that
hun
he
bandaged
my
head
and
my
as
well
as
the
doc
could
have
done
so
back
i
went
with
my
boches
as
gay
as
a
colt
and
it
suddenly
struck
me
as
rummy
i
still
was
ben
bolt
and
now
by
jove
how
i
bored
you
you
just
let
me
babble
away
let
talk
of
the
things
that
your
car
or
the
newest
the
mourners
i
look
into
the
aching
womb
of
night
i
look
across
the
mist
that
masks
the
dead
the
moon
is
tired
and
gives
but
little
light
the
stars
have
gone
to
bed
the
earth
is
sick
and
seems
to
breathe
with
pain
a
lost
wind
whimpers
in
a
mangled
tree
i
do
not
see
the
foul
plain
the
dead
i
do
not
see
the
slain
i
not
see
and
so
i
lift
my
eyes
from
out
the
shambles
where
they
lie
when
lo
a
million
drift
like
pale
leaves
through
the
sky
the
cheeks
of
some
are
channelled
deep
with
tears
but
some
are
tearless
with
wild
eyes
that
stare
into
the
shadow
of
the
coming
years
of
fathomless
despair
and
some
are
young
and
some
are
very
old
and
some
are
rich
some
poor
beyond
belief
yet
all
are
strangely
like
set
in
the
mould
of
everlasting
grief
they
fill
the
vast
of
heaven
face
on
face
and
then
i
see
one
weeping
with
the
rest
whose
eyes
beseech
me
for
a
moment
oh
eyes
i
love
the
best
nay
i
but
dream
the
sky
is
all
forlorn
and
there
the
plain
of
battle
writhing
red
god
pity
them
the
who
mourn
how
happy
are
the
dead
my
job
is
done
my
rhymes
are
ranked
and
ready
my
marching
verse
by
verse
here
are
none
too
steady
there
are
weak
but
might
be
worse
and
as
in
marshalled
order
i
review
them
my
unfearful
of
the
fray
my
eyes
that
seek
their
faults
are
seeing
through
them
immortal
visions
of
an
epic
day
it
seems
i
in
a
giant
the
hidden
heavies
round
me
crash
and
thud
a
spire
snaps
like
a
in
the
valley
the
rising
sun
is
like
a
ball
of
blood
along
the
road
the
fantassins
are
pouring
and
some
are
gay
as
fire
and
some
then
back
again
i
see
the
red
tide
pouring
along
the
reeking
road
from
hebuterne
and
once
again
i
seek
hill
the
hun
lines
grey
and
peaceful
in
my
sight
when
suddenly
the
rosy
air
is
riven
a
blots
the
boyou
on
my
right
or
else
to
evil
carnoy
i
am
stealing
past
sentinels
who
hail
with
bated
breath
where
not
a
cigarette
spark
dim
revealing
may
hint
our
mission
in
that
zone
of
death
i
see
across
the
meadows
the
jagged
of
la
boiselle
fricourt
brooding
in
the
shadows
and
thiepval
chateau
empty
as
a
shell
down
albert
riven
streets
the
moon
is
leering
the
hanging
virgin
takes
its
bitter
ray
and
all
the
road
from
hamel
i
am
hearing
the
silver
rage
of
bugles
over
bray
once
more
within
the
sky
deep
sapphire
hollow
i
sight
a
swimming
taube
a
fairy
thing
i
watch
the
angry
shell
flame
flash
and
follow
in
feather
puffs
that
flick
a
tilted
wing
and
then
it
fades
with
shrapnel
mirror
flashing
the
flashes
bloom
to
blossoms
lily
gold
the
batteries
are
rancorously
crashing
and
life
is
just
as
full
as
it
can
hold
oh
spacious
days
of
glory
and
of
grieving
oh
sounding
hours
of
lustre
and
of
loss
let
us
be
glad
we
lived
you
still
believing
the
god
who
gave
the
cannon
gave
the
cross
let
us
be
sure
amid
these
seething
passions
the
lusts
of
blood
and
hate
our
souls
abhor
the
power
that
order
out
of
chaos
fashions
smites
fiercest
in
the
forge
of
have
faith
fight
on
amid
the
love
