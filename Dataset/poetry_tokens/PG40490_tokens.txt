canoe
and

the
bryant
the
white
canoe
and
other
verse
the
white
canoe
there
a
whisper
of
life
in
the
grey
dead
trees
and
a
murmuring
wash
on
the
shore
and
a
breath
of
the
south
in
the
loitering
breeze
to
tell
that
a
winter
is
while
free
at
last
from
its
fetters
of
ice
the
river
is
clear
and
blue
and
cries
with
a
tremulous
quivering
voice
for
the
launch
of
the
white
canoe
oh
gently
the
ripples
will
kiss
her
side
and
tenderly
bear
her
on
for
she
is
the
wandering
phantom
bride
of
the
river
she
rests
upon
she
is
loved
with
a
love
that
can
not
forget
a
passion
so
strong
and
true
that
never
a
billow
has
risen
yet
to
peril
the
white
canoe
so
come
when
the
moon
is
enthroned
in
the
sky
and
the
echoes
are
sweet
and
low
and
nature
is
full
of
the
mystery
that
none
but
her
children
know
come
taste
of
the
rest
that
the
weary
crave
but
is
only
revealed
to
a
few
when
there
trouble
on
shore
there
peace
on
the
wave
afloat
in
the
white
canoe
a
vision
sweetheart
when
all
about
me
lay
in
shadow
deep
the
wood
i
felt
my
soul
within
me
reel
and
sway
and
pulse
my
sluggish
blood
as
when
along
a
quiet
bay
swells
some
resistless
flood
my
spirit
leapt
from
out
its
earthly
prison
higher
and
ever
higher
until
it
reached
those
barriers
elysian
where
the
eternal
fire
creates
one
great
impassable
division
twixt
us
and
our
desire
up
till
it
left
the
regions
of
the
night
of
sorrow
and
of
fear
emerging
into
that
soft
mellow
light
that
radiance
pure
and
clear
where
love
reigns
all
supreme
and
all
is
bright
if
only
love
be
near
there
through
sweet
meadows
on
by
brimming
streams
wandered
my
soul
at
will
and
saw
such
forms
as
haunt
our
loveliest
dreams
and
waking
haunt
us
still
voices
like
music
smiles
like
sunny
beams
lost
in
a
rippling
rill
but
ah
my
soul
saw
one
supremely
fair
one
form
the
most
divine
one
face
enhaloed
all
with
golden
hair
in
beauty
most
benign
surpassing
all
the
perfect
beauty
there
heart
of
my
heart
was
thine
my
soul
went
forth
but
all
grew
strange
and
dim
meadow
and
stream
were
gone
i
heard
a
sound
as
of
a
hymn
by
night
winds
softly
blown
then
all
around
me
seemed
to
sink
and
swim
and
i
am
here
alone
a
question
pale
moon
whose
tranquil
orb
resplendent
sails
the
ethereal
main
thy
curved
prow
for
ever
braving
the
celestial
gales
serene
and
slow
myriads
of
stars
that
ever
dot
the
blue
great
vault
of
heaven
eyes
that
keep
eternal
watch
unshaken
strong
and
true
yet
never
sleep
ye
southern
zephyrs
redolent
with
balm
of
myrtle
orange
and
the
rose
blowing
from
islands
where
the
fronded
palm
in
beauty
grows
wind
of
the
north
whose
trumpet
voice
can
shake
the
shuddering
echoes
of
the
cave
thou
whose
breath
doth
make
the
mighty
wave
perpetual
fire
whose
flame
consumes
the
glowing
heart
of
earth
until
a
wide
destruction
shall
proclaim
a
second
birth
tell
me
oh
mighty
concourse
have
ye
seen
in
all
this
great
infinity
of
worlds
unborn
and
planets
that
have
been
a
place
for
me
confession
creed
and
prayer
silent
around
me
a
cathedral
dim
still
throbbing
with
the
echoes
of
a
hymn
lifted
its
ghostly
arches
great
and
grim
slowly
the
worshippers
had
filed
away
untenanted
the
vacant
cloisters
lay
as
even
followed
on
the
steps
of
day
but
one
remained
who
bent
his
reverent
head
where
graven
figures
slumber
with
the
dead
and
spake
with
faltering
accents
and
he
said
light
light
more
light
great
father
give
me
light
i
can
not
see
my
way
so
dark
the
night
my
finite
heart
shrinks
from
the
infinite
anon
the
shadow
lifts
my
straining
eyes
one
moment
see
that
which
before
me
lies
this
fades
and
hope
within
me
dies
i
looked
for
sunshine
yet
there
cometh
rain
my
sweetest
pleasure
turneth
into
pain
i
would
sink
back
to
nothingness
again
beliefs
are
but
perpetual
ideas
the
gospel
worketh
only
on
my
fears
in
bitterness
and
sorrow
void
of
tears
in
one
god
i
believe
eternally
omnipotent
and
present
and
that
he
rules
heaven
and
hell
the
earth
the
sky
the
sea
as
carnal
life
by
carnal
love
is
given
so
life
divine
by
love
divine
is
proven
of
which
the
fountain
head
is
god
in
heaven
that
since
each
body
is
the
fleshly
home
of
something
better
something
not
our
own
so
god
all
faults
but
foulness
will
condone
for
i
believe
impurity
is
sin
against
the
spirit
life
that
dwells
within
creating
father
and
created
men
that
every
soul
is
judged
true
and
well
according
to
the
light
that
on
it
fell
no
light
no
judgment
strong
light
heaven
or
hell
all
this
and
more
great
father
i
have
heard
of
thy
dear
son
my
heart
expectant
stirred
to
welcome
him
confessing
i
had
erred
nay
said
humanity
within
me
nay
i
can
not
grasp
this
mystery
so
stay
until
i
comprehend
and
i
obey
i
would
yet
can
not
herein
lies
my
grief
thy
son
spake
comfort
to
the
dying
thief
so
speak
to
me
and
help
mine
unbelief
here
the
voice
faltered
ceased
god
can
it
be
the
morn
has
dawned
on
him
and
not
on
me
is
this
the
publican
i
pharisee
to
my
pipe
others
their
nectar
from
the
goblet
sip
i
draw
sweet
solace
from
thine
amber
lip
a
feast
of
reason
and
a
flow
of
soul
lurk
in
the
perfumed
vapors
of
thy
bowl
some
scoff
and
say
i
err
from
nature
rules
tobacco
poison
but
friend
some
are
fools
if
times
are
hard
no
comrade
like
to
thee
if
prosperous
the
priest
of
jollity
browned
in
my
service
through
age
thy
smouldering
fire
reflection
heritage
when
the
day
comes
old
friend
and
i
dead
broke
then
just
one
puff
we
both
go
up
in
smoke
supposing
he
supposing
that
when
we
were
wed
love
and
two
were
reduced
into
one
that
a
word
should
be
said
love
and
thoughtlessly
mischief
be
done
that
you
should
be
proud
and
offended
and
i
should
be
heartless
and
cold
do
you
think
that
our
peace
would
be
ended
the
tale
of
our
happiness
told
supposing
that
children
should
come
love
it
may
be
a
girl
and
a
boy
and
my
heart
should
go
forth
to
the
one
love
the
other
your
pride
and
your
joy
do
you
think
that
although
so
divided
yet
we
still
in
our
plans
could
agree
and
always
the
best
be
provided
for
our
dear
ones
by
you
and
by
me
supposing
that
times
were
so
bad
love
that
ends
could
possibly
meet
and
i
should
get
weary
and
sad
love
while
you
were
still
hopeful
and
sweet
do
you
think
you
inspirit
and
cheer
me
and
help
me
to
weather
the
gale
that
your
presence
would
ever
be
near
me
your
courage
not
falter
or
fail
she
supposing
you
darling
old
stupid
that
all
this
should
happen
and
more
do
you
think
that
the
youngster
called
cupid
would
fly
and
his
reign
would
be
no
the
bond
of
affection
would
stay
dear
independent
of
pocket
or
purse
as
a
wife
i
would
honor
obey
dear
and
love
you
for
better
for
worse
the
widower
lullaby
dost
remember
dear
one
floating
on
a
moonlit
silver
sea
stars
above
us
depths
beneath
us
shadows
covering
you
and
me
ever
drifting
spellbound
silent
down
a
shimmering
track
of
light
while
around
the
gloom
was
throbbing
with
the
mystery
of
night
mute
our
lips
what
need
of
speaking
but
our
heart
chords
were
as
tense
as
a
bowstring
stretched
to
breaking
every
look
was
eloquence
till
my
soul
had
burst
its
barriers
and
i
told
you
my
desire
told
of
love
undying
passion
strong
as
ocean
pure
as
fire
you
nor
moved
nor
sighed
nor
answered
pale
your
cheek
was
as
your
dress
but
the
golden
lashes
drooping
gave
response
and
it
was
yes
that
was
five
long
years
ago
dear
can
you
hear
me
as
i
speak
for
again
i
see
the
lashes
falling
on
a
pallid
cheek
still
and
ah
so
silent
sleeping
motionless
you
take
your
rest
i
your
pledge
of
love
beside
me
and
your
image
in
my
breast
just
one
golden
head
you
gave
me
little
one
with
eyes
of
blue
see
she
nestles
to
my
shoulder
darling
can
you
see
us
two
lullaby
sleep
little
one
sleep
safe
and
strong
is
thy
father
arm
he
will
guard
thee
from
every
harm
soothe
thee
with
kisses
soft
and
warm
sleep
little
one
sleep
sleep
little
one
sleep
close
the
lids
on
the
wondering
eyes
deep
and
blue
as
the
summer
skies
far
in
the
west
the
sunset
dies
sleep
little
one
sleep
sleep
little
one
sleep
thou
art
more
than
the
world
to
me
all
my
life
shall
be
spent
for
thee
till
nature
comes
with
her
lullaby
sleep
little
one
sleep
the
bird
in
the
night
once
long
ago
a
summer
night
in
june
when
earth
lay
still
beneath
a
waning
moon
and
never
sound
or
rustle
in
the
wood
save
the
dull
thunder
of
a
flood
hurling
itself
in
ruin
to
the
deep
a
great
gulf
i
lay
and
strove
to
sleep
the
stars
were
out
i
watched
with
aching
eye
their
slow
grand
march
across
a
cloudless
sky
but
rest
came
not
when
suddenly
i
heard
far
in
the
slumbering
forest
one
lone
bird
give
three
sweet
calls
as
if
in
pure
delight
to
fling
its
soul
in
music
through
the
night
like
a
cool
hand
upon
a
fevered
brow
came
that
dear
song
all
fear
had
vanished
now
steady
my
pulse
sunk
in
oblivion
arms
forgetful
as
a
child
of
past
alarms
ye
who
have
doubts
who
is
it
has
them
not
ye
who
have
fears
and
troubled
anxious
thought
when
the
storm
lulls
will
if
ye
list
aright
hear
a
bird
singing
in
your
darkest
night
nescio
at
felix
one
night
with
some
unquietness
and
dread
and
fear
of
boding
ill
within
my
soul
i
fell
to
sleep
before
me
like
a
scroll
lay
bare
the
coming
years
in
them
i
read
clear
writ
as
in
a
book
or
chart
the
vast
futurity
with
all
its
joy
and
grief
success
and
failure
love
hate
unbelief
and
faith
and
that
blind
parting
at
the
last
whereat
my
soul
recoiled
nor
could
it
bear
to
muse
on
so
much
labor
better
far
not
to
have
been
or
else
to
be
perchance
like
a
dumb
brute
existence
without
care
or
consciousness
but
with
the
morning
star
i
woke
and
thanked
god
for
my
ignorance
to
my
indian
pipe
thou
with
the
black
stone
stem
what
of
the
past
where
are
the
cunning
hands
that
fashioned
thee
where
are
the
stern
brown
lips
that
placidly
drew
comfort
from
thee
the
towering
mast
of
some
old
pine
or
patient
to
the
last
toiled
over
thee
perchance
thou
wert
a
god
worshipped
and
feared
by
those
whose
light
feet
trod
the
dim
green
aisles
of
that
cathedral
vast
but
now
thine
incense
rises
and
i
see
the
still
north
land
and
hear
the
otter
dive
the
rapids
calling
and
the
great
trout
leap
and
smoking
here
it
seemeth
like
to
me
as
if
some
dead
hands
touched
the
hands
alive
in
token
of
the
fellowship
we
keep
advenit
amor
silence
again
sweetheart
the
shadows
grow
i
watch
the
white
stars
climb
into
the
sky
hear
the
dull
rapids
softened
lullaby
in
smothered
thunder
brooding
sweet
and
low
catch
in
the
east
the
pallid
silver
glow
of
a
new
moon
that
floating
pure
and
clear
in
perfect
promise
of
the
fuller
sphere
dips
this
dim
world
in
glory
mounting
slow
not
always
had
the
heavens
such
a
charm
last
year
the
rapids
were
not
half
so
sweet
the
wind
had
not
such
rythmic
melody
till
love
love
came
and
fanned
the
cold
warm
attuned
to
music
chords
still
incomplete
and
set
the
whole
night
whispering
of
thee
a
song
of
life
it
came
through
the
fields
of
air
it
came
through
the
silent
night
borne
low
on
a
sigh
of
a
western
breeze
like
the
voice
of
tumultuous
seas
in
a
tempest
waning
might
i
heard
the
wonderful
song
it
made
its
home
in
my
breast
the
music
of
all
the
world
was
there
it
hushed
all
murmur
of
pain
or
care
a
psalm
of
infinite
rest
ever
more
clear
and
pure
ever
more
strong
and
sweet
till
some
kindred
chord
in
the
outer
air
in
response
to
the
melody
throbbing
there
sang
come
to
my
restless
feet
i
heard
the
mysterious
call
i
rose
and
followed
it
straight
many
a
mount
through
many
a
dale
past
blazing
meadow
and
shady
vale
to
the
sunset
roseate
gate
and
never
a
halt
or
stop
till
the
song
i
could
scarcely
hear
it
had
sunk
to
an
echo
faint
and
dim
of
some
melodious
wonderful
hymn
so
i
knew
that
the
end
was
near
lower
and
fainter
yet
and
more
imperceptible
still
as
i
journeyed
on
but
i
climbed
one
day
with
courage
that
faltered
so
steep
the
way
the
crest
of
a
long
long
hill
there
far
as
the
eye
could
scan
was
naught
but
the
fathomless
deep
while
down
at
the
crag
great
base
the
waves
crept
in
and
out
of
the
blind
black
caves
and
whispered
ever
of
sleep
i
looked
at
my
hair
was
white
my
hands
were
bony
and
long
the
years
of
my
life
had
vanished
and
fled
though
they
seemed
but
days
that
had
quickly
sped
in
pursuit
of
that
fugitive
song
then
out
of
the
ocean
heart
came
swelling
a
grand
refrain
and
through
it
there
pulsed
an
angelic
voice
now
weary
mortal
rejoice
rejoice
thou
hast
come
to
thy
rest
again
the
song
that
stole
into
thy
breast
was
the
song
of
an
earthly
love
it
was
but
an
echo
faint
yet
true
of
that
mightier
song
that
is
pealing
through
the
musical
halls
above
then
prone
on
the
bluff
my
face
to
a
golden
sky
the
breezes
played
with
my
dress
and
i
waited
and
prayed
in
my
loneliness
to
taste
of
the
worst
and
die
so
out
of
the
void
a
sound
from
the
vast
dim
space
a
breath
that
fanned
the
flickering
flame
of
life
till
it
flared
went
out
and
ended
the
strife
i
slept
and
the
sleep
was
death
voices
my
heart
within
me
stirred
with
a
nameless
trouble
and
dread
of
evil
that
should
betide
and
a
voice
in
my
bosom
said
what
pause
from
this
weary
toiling
what
end
to
this
endless
strife
the
day
bringeth
naught
but
labor
and
death
follows
hard
upon
life
ever
i
see
the
false
one
triumphing
over
the
true
the
foul
outbalance
the
fair
the
many
oppressed
by
the
few
answer
me
mortal
master
after
the
battle
is
fought
six
feet
of
earth
for
a
couch
mayhap
a
stone
then
what
how
could
i
answer
my
heart
when
suddenly
in
my
breast
there
fell
a
hush
as
of
a
wind
sinking
at
eve
to
rest
the
voice
within
me
was
stilled
and
i
felt
its
murmuring
cease
for
somewhere
out
of
infinity
an
angel
had
whispered
peace
fifty
years
hence
again
was
night
and
on
the
wave
the
moon
in
silver
lay
vanished
had
all
the
petty
cares
and
troubles
of
the
day
no
sound
in
all
the
wide
expanse
no
rustle
in
the
wood
save
when
some
evening
zephyr
stirred
in
whispers
on
the
flood
breathless
and
motionless
she
stood
unquestioningly
dumb
twas
as
a
world
were
waiting
there
waiting
for
god
to
come
then
back
through
long
dead
years
her
heart
winged
its
reflective
flight
to
ponder
childhood
days
again
to
muse
on
past
delight
a
mist
came
her
eyes
her
gaze
had
spanned
the
wide
gulf
old
voices
spake
old
scenes
recurred
old
friendship
lived
once
more
serene
the
skies
no
fear
no
care
no
tempest
and
no
storm
wild
birds
and
sunshine
in
the
air
and
south
winds
sweet
and
warm
ah
perfect
youth
ah
perfect
life
free
as
a
cloud
above
ah
fount
whence
spring
the
purest
hopes
whence
flows
the
purest
love
for
if
ambition
wildest
dreams
success
should
crown
in
truth
the
cup
she
holds
were
tasteless
still
beside
the
wine
of
youth
all
silent
now
ah
for
the
power
again
those
tales
to
tell
to
wake
afresh
those
sleeping
chords
that
memory
loves
so
well
but
echoing
clear
and
low
those
notes
that
song
we
still
may
hear
for
faintly
yet
its
music
floats
in
old
age
atmosphere
farewell
to
the
white
canoe
the
summer
is
dead
for
the
air
is
chill
and
winter
is
nigh
again
the
maples
ablaze
on
each
ruddy
hill
are
dripping
with
crimson
rain
black
dusk
comes
hard
on
the
steps
or
day
the
breath
of
the
south
that
blew
has
turned
to
the
north
and
bids
me
say
farewell
to
the
white
canoe
how
wildly
she
leapt
at
each
measured
stroke
and
mounted
the
curling
swell
how
the
white
foam
hung
at
her
bows
like
smoke
when
the
great
waves
rose
and
fell
no
terror
for
her
could
a
tempest
find
no
wrath
in
a
frowning
sky
her
birth
was
the
union
of
sea
and
wind
her
life
is
a
mystery
she
swam
like
a
ghost
through
the
ghostly
night
that
bowed
but
to
her
as
queen
she
sped
like
a
wraith
in
the
silver
light
or
a
spirit
of
things
unseen
as
a
leaf
in
the
autumn
she
sank
to
sleep
by
babbling
ripples
caressed
and
lay
in
the
arms
of
the
cradling
deep
on
the
river
responsive
breast
the
summer
is
dead
and
alas
no
more
may
we
wander
alone
and
free
by
still
deep
pools
and
the
shadowy
shore
and
the
rapids
soft
lullaby
farewell
farewell
to
the
peace
that
lies
in
that
solitude
deep
and
blue
an
answering
voice
from
the
great
stream
sighs
farewell
to
the
white
canoe
