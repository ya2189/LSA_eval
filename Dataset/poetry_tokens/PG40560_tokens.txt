those

he

each
song
or
verse
it
seems
to
me
should
be
distinguished
by
originality
if
nothing
else
the
matter
may
be
sloppy
but
that
no
matter
if
there
ample

so
that
the

face
could

unmasked

recognized

my

george

you

never
fibbed

what
is
more
i
think
my

are
sweeter
than
those
of

infernal
meter
and
more
heroic
and
not
half
so
sad
as
homer

everything

now
the
tune
is
quite
a

refrain
and
gentiles
everywhere
take
special
pains
to
pay
respectful
tribute
to
your

behold
your
ancient

rugged

your
fruitful

with
their
golden

that
grouped

silly

for
three
brass
spheroids

a

he

for
it
did
have
to

it
brother
hairy
glutton
would
diet
but
chickens
come
back
home
to
roost
forsooth
and
jacob
in
his
dotage
learned
this
truth
when
leah
sons
of
ordinary
clay
put
rachel
joseph
in
the
consomm√©
as
financiers
the
palm
has
been
bestowed
in
panegyric
melody
and
ode
on
jacob
sons
the
caravans
that
passed
thru
burning
sands
from
cities
far
and
vast
into
their
land
that
teemed
with
grain
and
gold
were
richly
laden
thus
they
bought
and
sold
exchanging
corn
and
cattle
hides
and
honey
for
finest
silks
and
linens
gems
and
money
until
thru
skill
and
daring
they
cornered
all
the
fabrics
used
for
wearing
and
then
proceeded
with
discerning
lust
to
hump
themselves
and
form
a
camel
trust
the
traders
who
had
plied
this
cargo
route
could
never
in
their
deals
get
cash
to
boot
from
jacob
sons
sometimes
a
fleece
or
skin
of
little
size
and
worth
would
be
thrown
in
but
shekels
no
and
so
the
nomad
sheik
in
quest
of
easy
picking
turk
and
greek
the
wily
fellah
from
the
distant
nile
whose
gaudy
gewgaw
gems
reflect
his
guile
the
sleepy
peddlers
from
the
land
of
nod
who
still
shekinah
on
ancestral
sod
and
all
the
wise
men
from
the
eastern
marts
who
plan
their
ventures
by
the
astral
charts
plotted
and
vowed
by
imps
and
endor
witches
to
wrest
from
jacobs
brothers
all
their
riches
so
working
now
with
bulls
anon
with
bears
rigging
the
market
to
advance
their
wares
or
to
depress
the
house
of
jacobs
shares
it
looked
as
if
the
plotters
might
make
good
against
the
unsuspecting
brotherhood
but
patiently
the
brethren
stood
their
ground
unmindful
of
the
rumors
passed
around
or
baits
to
tempt
cupidity
thrown
out
that
throttle
judgment
and
put
sense
to
rout
until
the
market
unsupported
broke
then
feigning
sleep
they
suddenly
awoke
and
took
possession
of
the
stock
exchange
like
beaten
curs
or
mongrels
with
the
mange
the
plotters
cringed
the
in
wild
dismay
to
cover
ran
but
zounds
they
had
to
pay
four
prices
to
the
brethren
who
controlled
the
entire
issue
of
the
short
stock
sold
and
thus
the
brethren
made
a
tidy
sum
keeping
their
standing
in
financialdom
keen
businessmen
they
sold
or
bought
as
well
but
never
showed
to
sell
so
jacob
sons
became
as
was
their
bent
the
mighty
merchants
of
the
orient
no
goose
that
ever
layed
a
golden
egg
would
needs
have
come
to
one
of
them
to
beg
for
life
or
respite
nay
lay
on
good
goose
we
shield
thee
and
thy
gander
from
abuse
and
in
such
cases
their
noses
were
not
lopped
to
spite
their
faces
too
wise
they
were
they
had
too
good
a
teacher
to
make
the
nose
too
prominent
a
feature
while
yet
the
goose
was
itching
for
the
nest
they
egged
her
on
and
quack
she
did
the
rest
a
goose
she
would
appear
to
give
so
much
to
those
who
had
but
life
is
ever
such
but
jacob
sons
like
isaac
sturdy
oak
made
no
complaint
but
bore
their
golden
yolk
and
thrifty
men
in
many
baskets
stored
the
golden
ovals
and
increased
their
hoard
and
so
their
nests
were
feathered
as
we
know
but
cautious
men
they
were
who
did
crow
and
so
we
see
them
on
the
filmy
screens
matching
their
talents
the
philistines
and
looking
close
we
notice
that
the
brothers
have
bigger
before
them
than
the
others
and
then
there
job
the
paradox
who
toils
to
show
good
humor
when
beset
by
boils
and
jinxy
jonah
ducked
and
rudely
whaled
because
he
had
no
passport
when
he
sailed
i
see
the
ocean
mammal
spout
methinks
it

jonah
delilah
next
tonsorial
adept
a
cutting
up
while
headstrong
samson
slept
shear
nonsense
that
man
vigor
could
be
sapped
because
he
had
a
haircut
when
he
napped
or
lose
his
nerve
at
the
yawning
grave
tho
just
escaping
by
the
closest
shave
with
samson
case
a
multitude
compare
for
men
miss
greatness
ofttimes
by
a
hair
was
his
conceit
that
made
him
lose
his
nerve
as
whiskered
men
bereft
deserve
the
facts
are
these
that
samson
used
to
wear
a
wig
with
ringlets
his
head
was
bare
one
night
in
playful
mood
delilah
stole
up
to
his
cot
and
touched
the
poor
old
soul
for
his
toupee
he
woke
chagrined
and
fled
because
his
capillary
roots
were
dead
what
transformation
thus
the
man
of
might
became
a
pussyfooter
overnight
and
went
to
writing
verses
from
that
minute
finding
his
strength
not
his
head
but
in
it
of
all
your
rulers
roman
jew
or
fezzer
the
first
or
most
pronounced
is
this
monstrous
name
has
been
derided
and
so
the
for
rhythm
is
elided
neb
is
enough
for
short
and
apropos
of
shadrach
meshack
and
abednego
the
king
waxed
wroth
because
these
three
live
wires
passed
thru
his
melting
pots
and
furnace
fires
without
a
burn
remarkable
endurance
because
protected
by
good
fire
insurance
he
paid
the
price
for
arson
ere
he
died
was
kept
lit
up
and
rightly
classified
among
the
beasts
and
now
that
all
is
over
is
safe
to
say
he
did
not
live
in
clover
but
roamed
the
pastures
when
he
lost
his
pull
and
grazed
himself
to
death
he
was
bull
then
next
we
come
to
ruth
the
moabite
her
husband
chilion
not
her
one
night
blew
out
the
gas
and
ruth
was
thus
bereft
but
naomi
her
was
left
to
comfort
her
and
jolly
well
she
did
it
for
ruth
great
grief
soon
ceased
or
else
she
hid
it
then
to
naomi
land
the
two
repaired
their
love
enhanced
by
sorrows
they
had
shared
and
so
the
elder
of
the
widowed
twain
set
out
to
find
for
ruth
another
swain
and
all
her
schemes
is
said
succeeded
so
as
to
marry
ruth
to
wealthy
kinsman
boaz
unselfish
no
was
too
old
to
wed
so
ruth
agreed
to
give
her
board
and
bed
trusting
to
boaz
not
to
spoil
her
plan
who
swallowed
hook
and
line
like
any
man
the
attic
room
or
one
just
off
the
hall
was
where
naomi
nightly
had
to
crawl
and
all
her
meals
unleavened
bread
and
were
eaten
in
the
kitchen
with
the
waiters
for
boaz
when
the
honeymoon
was
spent
tightened
his
would
spend
a
cent
and
naomi
as
welcome
was
i
think
as
hungry
roaches
in
the
kitchen
sink
this
is
the
only
case
i
know
no
other
where
widowed
wife
abided
husband
mother
or
where
a
woman
in
such
circumstance
would
give
her
son
relict
another
chance
there
baal
and
those
exalting
gods
of
brass
and
balaam
prophet
but
we
let
him
pass
and
john
the
baptist
man
who
lost
his
head
to
fair
salom√©
tho
she
cut
him
dead
there
absalom
the
vain
whose
hair
was
long
who
in
the
final
parting
got
in
wrong
and
pharaoh
with
chariots
and
fighters
pursuing
moses
and
the
israeliters
who
over
when
the
king
dropped
in
punished
the
latter
for
his
divers
sin
and
rescued
on
the
red
sea
bar
his
folk
athirst
for
freedom
from
the
ptolemy
yoke
while
yet
the
rushes
bent
beneath
the
blast
of
red
sea
winds
a
prodigy
was
cast
from
common
perhaps
but
is
enough
to
know
that
he
was
made
of
proper
stuff
and
little
did
the
tempest
wot
his
noise
was
silence
likened
to
the
bawling
boy
the
earth
breathed
on
the
shape
and
gave
it
speech
or
something
vocally
akin
a
screech
thus
moses
had
his
coming
out
and
lo
he
rushed
into
the
arms
of
fairy
o
daughter
of
pharaoh
the
mighty
king
who
bore
him
to
the
palace
her
wing
fed
on
the
milk
of
kindness
to
begin
with
medica
materia
thrown
in
he
grew
until
appointed
by
decree
to
little
egypt
princess
the
thus
doctor
moses
hung
his
shingle
out
and
soon
his
fame
was
heralded
about
to
doctors
since
no
fame
like
his
doth
cling
no
specialist
he
doctored
everything
he
analyzed
and
stopped
the
human
leak
his
patience
was
rewarded
so
to
speak
he
charged
his
people
to
eschew
the
swine
and
made
the
ten
commandments
seem
benign
not
only
as
physician
did
he
rate
but
as
a
surgeon
he
could
amputate
he
cut
off
pharaoh
in
his
pursuit
and
by
this
operation
gained
repute
he
set
his
people
right
and
made
no
bones
of
driving
lepers
from
the
safety
zones
he
gave
them
tablets
for
their
moral
healing
knowing
their
pulses
without
even
feeling
his
praises
now
resound
from
every
lip
because
he
saved
the
jews
from
grippe
still
the
nile
the
curlews
flock
where
moses
took
his
henchmen
out
of
hock
the
minions
of
√¶olus
hurtle
on
leaving
a
trail
of
foam
the
waves
upon
stopping
anon
where
restless
driftwood
crushes
the
lotus
pads
that
hover
near
the
rushes
to
chant
a
requiem
and
breathe
a
prayer
over
the
spot
that
cradled
moses
there
if
modern
doctors
would
obey
the
rule
of
common
sense
prescribed
by
moses
school
if
they
would
note
our
pulses
and
our
looks
instead
of
feeling
of
our
and
judging
circulation
by
the
latter
we
sometimes
know
perhaps
just
what
the
matter
what
doctor
now
would
diagnosis
make
and
call
it
simple
charging
a
trifling
fee
to
cure
the
pain
ah
no
those
days
will
not
return
again
no
more
alas
will
cramps
delight
us
for
colic
now
is
styled
appendicitis
by
leaps
and
bounds
have
grown
the
trifling
fees
five
hundred
now
succeeds
one
dollar
please
and
germs
in
league
with
doctors
have
their
station
at
vital
points
to
force
inoculation
so
that
our
systems
pay
a
pretty
price
for
nostrum
fake
device
known
to
the
school
of
quacks
and
so
we
suffer
imposed
upon
by
patentee
and
duffer
o
for
a
moses
that
our
crying
need
to
cure
physicians
of
unbridled
greed
and
probe
no
matter
where
it
hurts
the
cause
of
doctors
strange
immunity
from
laws
o
for
an
instrument
an
act
or
sermon
of
moses
kind
to
cut
the
germ
from
german
and
lead
them
from
the
wilderness
of
vice
whose
hearts
were
warm
but
now
have
turned
to
ice
all
these
and
many
more
increase
the
lustre
distinguishing
this
brilliant
jewish
cluster
and
abraham
we
save
him
for
the
last
tho
first
in
line
renowned
iconoclast
of
all
the
israelites
the
men
of
mark
who
else
compares
with
this
grand
patriarch
and
who
besides
of
all
the
racial
roots
developed
half
the
lusty
leaves
and
shoots
strong
limbs
and
branches
virile
seed
trunk
the
ark
with
all
this
luggage
would
have
sunk
and
so
well
the
deluge
didst
the
earth
ere
this
with
noah
at
the
helm
else
to
preserve
the
chosen
and
elite
of
israel
line
would
needs
have
taxed
a
fleet
i
love
these
ancient
tribesmen
who
illumine
the
archives
of
the
past
they
were
so
human
their
frailties
were
but
habits
of
the
race
since
father
adam
set
the
human
pace
hitched
up
with
eve
who
chafing
at
the
bit
did
well
her
part
or
bit
in
spite
of
it
but
all
their
mortal
weaknesses
were
nil
compared
with
virtues
that
their
records
fill
and
good
or
bad
or
medium
or
fair
no
tribe
excelled
their
morals
anywhere
they
freely
gave
their
tithes
but
did
it
pay
to
advertise
their
wealth
a
give
away
and
so
their
pockets
have
been
worn
and
frayed
by
frequent
contributions
they
have
made
to
charity
and
church
i
hope
and
pray
they
saved
a
little
for
a
rainy
day
i
think
they
have
for
money
talked
confessed
that
hebrews
were
the
ones
he
liked
the
best
because
they
never
slighted
or
abused
him
and
always
were
so
careful
how
they
used
him
and
so
o
sons
of
abraham
i
say
you
come
into
your
own
and
come
to
stay
the
promised
land
is
yours
but
what
is
more
the
earth
and
seas
and
skies
with
all
their
store
you
wandered
from
judea
but
why
care
because
your
home
is
here
as
well
as
there
and
we
would
miss
you
just
as
much
i
vum
as
those
who
wait
you
in
capernaum
for
broadway
would
despair
and
sackcloth
don
if
you

flies

sands
them
over

the

slink

in
burning
sands
his
shameless
head
and
lets
his

be
stripped
of

by

the

is

a

kind
of
fowl
he
works
while

sleep
the

old
owl

stores
up
food
against
the
rainy
day
in
secret
nooks
from

shiftless
sing

the

you
see
is

misfortune
spared

on
the
railroad
crossing
stood
chewing
contentment
cud
as
heifers
should
when
rushing
madly
late
again
there
came
the
noonday
mail
the
heifer
was
to
blame
for
choosing
her
position
i
would
say
because
the
engine
had
the
right
of
whey
the
cow
was
unprepared
her
switching
tail
failed
signally
to
flag
the
noonday
mail
but
why
keep
beefing
over
milk
that
spilled
she
heeded
not
the
sign
and
thus
was
killed
heifers
with
unprotected
flanks
should
not

stalks

he

is
in

his

but
kick
he
will
no

how
he
headed
with

lacking

to
the

he
be
just
simple
mule
forevermore
without

blaze
away

thwart
his

with
his
brazen
bray
if

were

no

withstand
his

a

have
you
noticed
never

in

so
the

the

how
i
loved
her
there
on

we
lean
the
dear
old
gate
that
never
gave
away
the
loving
nothings
we
were
wont
to
say
from
day
to
day
and
sometimes
after
dark
she
was
my
just
sixteen
but
i
was
shy
and
while
i
longed
to
taste
the
nectar
of
her
lips
i
was
afraid
to
draw
her
to
my
breast
and
kiss
the
maid
but
i
essayed
and
this
is
what
i
drew
there
papa
with
the
bulldog
so
make
haste
what
could
i
do
the
bark
was
flecked
with
foam
and
old
man
jones
was
meaner
than
a
cur
so
there
i
stood
fear
and
love
of
her
and
did
stir
until
they
came

then

golfus

who
is
this
man
professional
no

he
card
a
going

and
if
he
gets
the
breaks
he
make
methinks
a
new
low
record
for
the
piedmont
links
see
with
what
confidence
he
wends
his
way
the
fairway
thru
to
make
his
hole
out
play
the
gallery
expectant
follows
thru
to
see
the
champion
go
down
in
then
to
the
ball
he
makes
his
last
address
the
ball
was
peeved
at
what
he
said
i
guess
and
pulls
his
gooseneck
back
a
foot
or
so
before
he
hits
the
sphere
the
fateful
blow
alas
for
human
frailty
see
it
flit
across
the
green
into
the
sandy
pit
the
sighing
winds
in
protest
moaned
beware
while
he
invoked
the
deity
in
prayer
and
then
he
played
his
third
but
topped
the
sphere
the
rubber
rogue
responding
with
a
leer
a
halo
hung
around
the
stranger
head
it
seemed
but
nay
was
brimstone
fire
instead
for
what
he
said
in
type
is
not
displayed
except
on
paper
i
afraid
four
five
six
but
still
far
from
the
goal
the
player
loses
all
his
and
breaks
the
goose
in
twain
then
hark
the
din
when
caddie
trails
the
ball
and
it
far
from
the
scene
of
strife
the
club
house
becks
the
weary
golfers
on
their
inward
treks
and
close
beside
beneath
the
porch
shade
the
nineteenth
hole
dispenses
lemonade
and
other
cheering
drinks
within
the
law
but
little
ice
that
cuts
who
cares
a
straw
the
spirit
of
france
yes
i
done
my
bit
as
you
fellows
would
say
if
serving
one
country
deserves
any
praise
two
years
at
the
front
then
an
arm
shot
away
and
this
is
my
cross
in
reward
for
those
days
but
i
can
do
more
while
there
blood
in
my
veins
i
give
the
last
drop
while
the
hoof
of
the
hun
polluted
and
cloven
in
alsace
remains
until
france
is
free
we
must
fight
every
one
of
course
i
go
back
to
the
trenches
again
my
wound
is
fast
healing
and
soon
will
be
sound
six
chevrons
have
i
but
i
fight
with
the
men
who
fill
up
the
like
moles
in
the
ground
i
charge
with
the
boys
when
they
hurdle
the
top
the
lashed
to
my
arm
with
pistol
or
sword
in
my
hand
till
i
drop
for
freedom
is
menaced
go
sound
the
alarm
france
needs
every
son
be
they
crippled
or
strong
to
rid
our
fair
land
of
the
murderous
horde
so
flock
to
the
colors
brave
boys
come

there
no

all
aglow
we

discord
with

there
a
shadow
on

that
once
was
so
sunny
and
gay
but
billing
and
cooing
subordinate
stewing
at
the
end
of
a
sweetless
day
when
will
beefsteak

not
be
sold
by

how
long
will
these
high
prices
stay
when
the
bad
profiteers
show
contrition
and
tears
at
the
dawn
of
a
cheatless
day
when
our
soldiers
in
france
do
their
indian
dance
and
scalp
all
the
huns
in
the
fray
the
kaiser
will
holler
with
rope
for
a
collar
at
the
end
of
his
ruthless
day
a
protest
while
now
is
meet
to
eat
fish
eggs
and
maize
meat
and
wheat
we
dine
or
sup
so
be
it
but
this
protest
i
would
raise
in
spite
of
warnings
veal
keeps
bobbing
up
a
prayer
o
sun
and
skies
that
hoover
our
fields
where
grains
implanted
lie
and
silos
stand
pour
out
thy
warmth
and
rains
till
hunger
yields
thruout
the
world
to
our
blest
since
the
little
one
came
i
seem
to
have
taken
a
new
lease
on
life
since
the
little
one
came
i
lost
the
old
grouch
and
i
say
to
my
wife
do
you
think
i
to
blame
because
i
have
changed
in
my
feelings
towards
you
since
the
little
one
came
the
furnace
is
true
gave
me
something
to
do
but
i
think
it
a
shame
that
some
tiny
tie
like
the
little
one
here
how
is
snooks
for
a
name
was
not
sooner
left
on
our
doorstep
my
dear
the
store
takes
my
time
but
a
very
small
part
it
all
over
at
four
i
cut
clancy
out
and
have
made
a
new
start
all
my
cronies
are
sore
but
what
do
i
care
i
have
mended
my
ways
so
i
rush
from
the
store
and
hasten
back
home
where
the
little
one
plays
on
the
rugg√®d
hall
floor
and
pick
him
up
quick
o
how
pretty
he
looks
without
shutting
the
door
so
anxious
i
am
to
caress
little
the
chafes
and
the
is
sore
we
have
given
them
up
the
and
bridge
are
tabooed
evermore
there
is
joy
in
our
cup
we
cut
out
the
movies
and
dining
about
for
our
own
modest
sup
and
billiards
and
golfing
i
cut
them
both
out
as
i
did
to
the
hup
with
playthings
and
drum
and
a
ruppy
tup
tup
loaded
up
like
a
krupp
i
beat
it
to
snooky
our
bull
run
along
little
girl
run
along
little
girl
for
it
now
your
dollies
are
sleepy
and
poor
old
is
weary
and
lonesome
curled
up
in
a
heap
take
little
rocking
to
put
him
to
sleep
your
teddy
bear
growling
or
is
it
a
snore
perhaps
he
objects
to
his
bed
on
the
floor
so
pick
up
your
treasures
and
when
prayers
are
said
run
along
little

and
climb
in

run
along
little

the
sandman
is
here
you

too
much
into
one
day
i
fear
poor
little
tired
girlie
you
worked
at
your
play
till
the
bloom
of
your
cheeks
has
faded
away
again
you
can
sit
by

and
dress
all
your

in
gala
attire

good

and
seams

spooks
in
the

nor
bogeymen
glaring
when

be
hitched
to

befall
you
when

a
retrospect
picture
a
home
with
love
aglow
and
laughter
reverberating
from
each
joist
and
rafter
a
mother
kissing
you
good
night
with
go
to
sleep
lest
santa
claus
take
fright
and
dashes
by
leaving
no
books
or
toys
for
naughty
little
girls
and
boys
then
see
her
down
the
stairs
and
trim
the
tree
a
toy
on
outstretched
limb
the
and
wagon
at
the
base
and
in
the
big
fireplace
for
thus
we
retrospect
to
show
no
other
would
scheme
and
work
and
fabricate
like
mother
to
make
our
christmas
day
a
grand
fruition
and
keep
the
secret
of
its
sweet
tradition
the
eagle
screams
we
have
arrived
america
is
first
here
freedom
cradled
here
its
p√¶an
burst
upon
the
ears
of
nations
near
and
far
till
light
of
freedom
is
the
guiding
star
thruout
the
world
though
thraldom
still
obscures
the
guiding
star
where
tyranny
endures
was
ever
thus
till
boston
reb
array
upset
king
george
teapot
in
the
bay
and
pegasus
whom
we
revere
astride
his
hobby
warned
the
countryside
before
that
time
the
briton
played
the
game
of
la
or
golf
its
proper
name
with
confidence
and
brassie
nerve
methinks
until
they
struck
a
bunker
on
our
links
that
thwarted
all
their
prowess
my
soul
and
left
them
groggy
at
the
nineteenth
hole
but
still
they
puttered
and
drank
our
rum
till
washington
avenging
time
had
come
when
with
his

steeled
at
valley

he
george
the

where
now
the

guards
his
brood
the

the
stars
are
agleam
in
their
azurine
field
diffusing
effulgence
afar
but
magnitude
lustre
and
fixedness
yield
to
the
glorious
service
star
in
aureate
setting
a
pendant
aglare
is
the
radiant
service
star
that
blazes
with
fire
like
a
rare
solitaire
a
gift
to
the
valkyr
of

protect
thou
our
treasure
o
valkyr
restore
our
jewel
so
priceless
and
bar
from
valhalla
dungeons
where
death
torrents
pour
our
sanctified
service
star
some
day
some
day
when
the
war
is
ended
and
we
sail
from
france
away
with
sorrow
and
longings
blended
back
home
to
america
and
we
live
once
more
in
blighty
a
thousand
years
in
a
day
in
the
land
of
god
almighty
where
the
old
folks
watch
and
pray
some
day
when
we
hit
the
pillow
again
on
a
bed
as
snug
as
an
armadillo
with
his
head
when
bugles
refrain
from
tooting
and
noises
of
battle
stop
when
victory
ends
recruiting
or
charging
over
the
top
day
when
we
thru
with
fighting
and
the
beaten
hun
retreats
when
the
cooties
cease
from
biting
and
we
sleep
between
the
sheets
the
cruise
of
the
sea
serpent
and
now
behold
the
merchant
submarine
only
its
peeking
periscope
is
seen
but
what
a
cyclorama
it
reveals
to
those
below
thru
surging
seas
it
steals
and
vies
with
dolphins
porpoises
and
sharks
to
keep
apace
with
brigantines
and
barks
and
tho
itself
unseen
it
proud
to
show
to
what
low
depths
a
submarine
can
go
the
cyclops
sees
as
well
by
night
as
day
its
father
neptune
gives
it
right
of
way
amphibious
it
rides
the
ocean
crest
or
in
its
sunken
gardens
takes
its
rest
this
boat
we
designate
as
it
because
no
other
pronoun
seems
to
fit
no
craft
could
be
a
he
nor
one
unspoken
could
be
rated
she
the
germans
call
it
u
cargo
they
aim
to
close
the
bar
on
the
embargo
beneath
the
waves
no
lurching
doth
it
feel
but
speeds
its
course
upon
an
even
keel
with
duplex
engines
and
a
double
crew
it
manned
by
mermaids
when
it
hid
from
view
it
scoffs
at
dangers
tho
they
lurk
around
and
shuts
its
to
perils
that
abound
there
scant
spare
space
but
still
its
ribs
enfold
a
priceless
cargo
in
its
shallow
hold
past
hostile
ships
into
a
neutral
haven
it
comes
up
smiling
with
all
flags
a
wavin
but
now
these
cargo
craft
throw
off
disguise
and
cut
our
neutral
throats
it
no
surprise
that
dastards
who
as
scraps
of
paper
rate
their
solemn
treaties
would
thus
lie
in
wait
and
murder
innocents
without
emotion
making
a
shambles
of
the
outraged
ocean
now
lashed
to
fury
see
the
waves
rebel
and
sweep
these
prussian
pirates
down
to
hell
no
longer
neutral
the
avenging
sword
is
in
our
hands
to
smite
the
horde
the
god
of
joshua
in
righteous
wrath
will
in
its
flight
thru
empyrean
path
command
the
sun
to
stop
it
is
his
will
till
be
effaced
and
not
until
america
america
crusader
in
the

before
thy

we
pause
and
offer
grateful
prayer
that
thou
art
right
in
making
demonstration
of
thy

without
a
thought
of
conquest
doth
thou
draw
thine

sword
for

washed
with

its

like

was
the
lambkin
was
prized
and
kept
from
the
sheep
in
the
stable
who
never
were

the
lamb
had
a
yearning
for
knowledge
and
schoolward
would
follow

lass
till
she
was
admitted
to
college

out
of

a

her

fail

so
she
lams
her

just
for

she
looks
at

deep

in

of
the

they

i
shot
an

i
shot
an
arrow
how
it
sang
it
was
a
poisoned
arrow
and
when
it
turned
a
boomerang
it
chilled
me
to
the

i

not
where
the
arrow
struck
and
care
but
little
whether
it
came
straight
back
or
ran
amuck
upon

i

fast
the

pulled
the
props
away
my
son
i
swear
by
all
the
periscopes
and
zeppelins
to
which
i
pin
my
hopes
by
all
the
ocean
sharks
and
bats
by
as
i
hope
to
die
not
to
blame
i
did
use
the
spurs
or
try
to
overwork
geographers
i
fought
for
peace
and
defiance
hurled
altho
the
fatherland
rule
the
world
but
here
the
truth
a
secret
i
disclose
a
stranger
was
who
made
us
come
to
blows
it
happened
thus
a
mighty
nimrod
came
from
afric
wilds
where
he
had
played
the
game
until
his
cudgel
bore
a
hundred
nicks
a
record
this
for
all
prodigious
sticks
to
germany
no
pussyfoot
was
his
but
there
was
courage
in
his
nobel
phiz
and
in
his
stride
were
energy
and
grace
enough
to
make
the
commonplace
i
took
him
to
my
palace
as
my
guest
and
poured
libations
from
the
cellar
he
was
a
see
so
just
accord
this
proper
secrecy
and
then
arranged
to
hold
a
grand
review
of
all
my
armies
and
reservists
too
said
my
guest
and
nothing
more
as
we
reviewed
my
legions
corps
by
corps
but
this
blunt
comment
signified
his
zeal
and
so
i
mobilized
my
fleet
at
kiel
and
on
my
royal
yacht
my
guest
and
i
watched
the
maneuvres
as
my
ships
passed
by
bill
the
hardy
hunter
shouted
such
a
fleet
i
have
the
whole
world
routed
and
with
your
armies
i
would
soon
disperse
the
fighting
units
of
the
universe
such
praise
was
pleasing
to
my
ears
altho
my
wasps
and
i
did
show
i
deemed
it
best
to
this
when
all
my
ships
and
men
were
in
their
places
had
he
seen
i
knew
he
would
advise
the
conquest
of
the
earth
and
seas
and
skies
but
shades
of
bismarck
you
understand
might
prove
a
strain
upon
the
fatherland
and
so
i
kept
the
peace
but
thought
about
the
many
martial
plans
we
figured
out
and
how
the
cost
of
my
frontier
defences
compared
with
his
proposed
campaign
expenses
you
see
mein
heir
this
man
was
full
of
guile
and
caused
the
war
this
bey
of
oyster
isle
he
hypnotized
me
put
it
in
my
mind
to
be
the
potentate
of
all
mankind
so
blame
me
not
the
fault
i
must
disown
and
put
the
guilt
on
theodore
alone
whatever
comes
anon
i
not
whipped
yet
and
with
it
all
i
have
but
one
regret
that
was
not
impressed
to
lead
my
drive
to
petersburg
to
take
the
czar
alive
and
then
a
marshal
ordered
to
paree
to
capture
it
and
bring
it
back
to
me
then
take
my
fleet
the
english
channel
over
and
put
king
george
to
rout
and
bombard
dover
and
then
supplant
the
sultan
take
his
fez
and
lead
my
peerless
forces
to
suez
while
have
failed
and
hindenburg
and
mack
never
fizzles
when
he
makes
attack
see
what
i
missed
for
what
he
has
and
yet
his
vast
campaign
is
just
begun
he
leads
his
legions
bull
moose
calf
and
cow
to
capture
a
convention
an
orderly
approached
the
royal
pair
just
at
this
stage
and
left
despatches
there
he
stood
at
close
attention
hand
to
head
while
this
absorbing
cablegram
was
read
outflanked
and
captured
resignation
tendered
mooses
dehorned
and
all
the
herd
surrendered
am
looking
for
another
job
already
would
take
the
german

teddy
the

turned
looked
at
the
prince
and
wept
while
noxious
gases
the
bulwarks
crept
love
recompense
do
you
really
truly
love
me
with
a
love
that
mocks
at
fate
cried
the
rustic
buxom
maiden
to
her
lover
at
the
gate
yes
my
pet
and
when
dame
fortune
smiles
upon
us
we
will
wed
i
will
strew
your
path
with
roses
bear
me
witness

thus
he
spake
unto
his
sweetheart
under
heaven
starry
blue
and
the
angels
smiling
on
him
heard
his
vow
to
be
true
then
he
placed
his
arms
around
her
kissed
her
they
were
in
a
trance
and
two
toward
were
lifted
as
the
bulldog
grabbed
his

adam

come
comrades
gather
the
festal
board
and
quaff
the
sparkling
water
from
the
gourd
is
the
drink
that
adam
tribe
imbibed
before
the
wines
of
gath
were
diatribed
methinks
some
other
brand
was
drunk
by
cain
the
day
that
abel
ruthlessly
was
slain
and
won
against
all
other
potions
there
the
first
white
ribbon
at
the
gaza
fair
you
never
know
until
you
take
a
sip
its
power
to
soothe
and
cool
the
fevered
lip
had
noah
water
he
would
shine
as
undisputed
master
of
the
brine
the
that
he
launched
at
first
steered
noah
straight
but
did
cure
his
thirst
so
when
he
the
ararat
caf√©
he
soon
fell
off
his
rudder
washed
away
but
wallward
turn
the
picture
you
beholding
and
hang
more
cheerful
paintings
on
the
moulding
behold
a
of
eclat
this
fair
rebecca
had
the
skill
to
she
stands
beside
the
well
and
plies
the
sweep
while
sweat
and
blushes
her
features
creep
such
grace
and
poise
such
strength
and
skill
such
sweeping
gestures
and
unbending
will
are
indices
of
abstinence
complete
we
ca
abstain
from
loving
you
petite
upon
her
head
she
rests
the
dripping
urn
and
goes
straight
home
she
does
to
turn
do
stumble
miss
or
suffer
teasing
boys
to
cause
derangement
of
your
equipoise
but
keep
your
head
and
waver
not
at
all
lest
you
be
deluged
by
the
waterfall
so
daily
to
the
pool
rebecca
strayed
and
drank
the
water
when
she
did
wade
and
thus
her
framework
waxed
like
iron
i
trust
was
assailed
or
undermined
by
rust
so
fill
the
gourd
and
pass
it
to
your
friend
it
safety
first
and
safety
to
the
end
no
headaches
lurk
within
no
tinge
of
sorrow
no
dark
forebodings
or
remorse
and
furthermore
it
is
hard
to
take
if
you
not
tried
it
for
mercy
sake
behold
the
oaken
bucket
hanging
high
by
bards
and
singers
lauded
to
the
sky
it
never
touched
in
all
its
useful
days
a
thing
but
water
here
fair
psyche
plays
beside
the
spring
that
mirrors
all
her
graces
would
you
object
to
such
cases
now
mark
the
fate
befalling
jack
and
jill
because
they
slipped
and
let
the
water
spill
and
see
poor
tantalus
for
water
crying
thus
punished
for
his
sins
athirst
and
dying
and
note
this
titian
called
the
drunkard
fate
in
which
the
crimson
hues
predominate
he
holds
the
in
his
close
embrace
and
has
a
package
from
pat
murphy
place
to
carry
home
his
eyes
are
red
and
dim
so
close
the
bar
and
turn
the
hose
on
him
this
drink
was
ever
priceless
yet
it
free
the
source
and
fountain
of
sobriety
and
so
we
offer
without
bar
or
price
enough
of
this
to
put
your
thirst
on
ice
so
drink
to
water
while
the
billows
swell
the
world
wants
prohibition
and
all
well
russia
canst
thou
in
all
this
babel
build
aright
freedom
palladium
the
long
black
night
that
ages
thru
hath
dimmed
your
yearning
eyes
and
dulled
your
minds
still
hovers
your
skies
a
rift
there
was
disclosing
to
your
view
the
dawn
of
day
but
then
the
darkness
grew
yet
more
intense
as
if
the
sun
rebelled
at
such
a
cheerless
greeting
and
withheld
its
light
and
now
again
night
reigns
supreme
but
just
beyond
the
day
is
all
agleam
belgium
and
weary
thou
must
suffer
more
until
thy
supermen
have
paid
the
score
for
outraged
daughters
murdered
sons
and
wives
for
ravaged
homesteads
and
brave
soldiers
lives
be
not
dismayed
altho
your
cup
of
woe
is
full
to
overflowing
from
the
blow
tho
justice
seems
indifferent
to
your
prayer
and
ruin
stalks
about
you
everywhere
the
day
of
reckoning
is
near
at
hand
when
justice
will
restore
your
pillaged
land
and
vengeance
will
unsheath
its
righteous
blade
and
flay
the
teutons
till
your
score
is
paid
our
friends
across
the
street
to
and
w
a
when
we
tired
of
reading
essays
tho
they
be
a
mental
treat
when
we
bored
by
social
callers
be
they
ever
so
elite
when
we
crave
some
relaxation
or
the
foursome
incomplete
we
or
telephone
to
our
friends
across
the
street
when
our
larder
needs
renewing
or
our
ice
succumbs
to
heat
when
the
signs
of
drought
are
brewing
our
stock
is
incomplete
and
our
chairs
are
insufficient
when
we
have
some
guests
to
seat
why
we
just
go
out
and
borrow
from
our
friends
across
the
street
when
we
worried
or
in
trouble
and
our
projects
meet
defeat
when
our
prospects
seem
quite
hopeless
life
seems
bitter
that
was
sweet
when
we
lose
our
nerve
and
falter
the
rough
way
wounds
our
feet
we
can
always
find
sweet
comfort
in
our
friends
across
the
street
when
we
end
at
last
our
journey
and
the
saintly
peter
greet
or
descend
to
realms
infernal
where
the
goats
rejected
bleat
we
would
never
feel
contented
whether
mixed
with
chaff
or
wheat
if
we
could
be
together
with
our
friends
across
the
street
epitaphs
i
left
this
vale
of
tears
to
gain
repose
and
change
for
harp
and
wings
my
worldly
clothes
there
no
redress
so
if
i
from
grace
i
be
quite
cool
enough
for
place
wed
bled
fled
dead
nufsed
go
not
the
way
i
went
o
mortal
man
but
follow
out
a
more
successful
plan
lest
you
as
i
am
now
remorseful
be
for
imitating
currency
for
forty
cents
an
hour
i
slaved
at
delpont
powder
mills
and
all
the
money
that
i
saved
scarce
paid
my
funeral
bills
erected
to
our
father
is
this
stone
he
could
leave
the
whiskey
flask
alone
to
spirit
world
he
vanished
from
our
sight
we
hope
he
very
snug
and
he
tight
above
the
clouds
i
sojourn
now
the
twinkling
stars
between
because
i
tried
to
figure
how
to
cook
with
gasolene
i
all
right
but
not
quite
dead
for
schemes
of
vengeance
hurtle
thru
my
head
my
wife
eloped
a
cheating
chicken
she
forsook
her
nest
and
then
flew
back
to
me
with
all
her
brood
i
love
her
as
i
useter
but
i
for
that
other
rooster
i
followed
father
with
the
rake
the
day
he
scythed
the
clover
so
he
cut
by
mistake
and
my
heydays
were
over
here
sleeps
at
last
our
little
baby
yorick
could
make
him
i
not
averse
to
being
dead
but
this
i
do
despise
to
have
a
tombstone
at
my
head
inscribed
with
blooming
lies
a
faithful
spouse
a
parent
kind
alas
too
soon
he
went
but
this
is
all
they
had
in
mind
to
get
my
last
red
cent
assembled
here
my
wife
is
helen
nation
was
gasoline
that
caused
the
separation
which
shows
how
very
short
the
mortal
lease
is
i
think
was
lucky
to
have
saved
the
pieces
here
let
me
rest
without
a
sigh
or
tear
i
learned
my
lesson
not
to
interfere
if
i
could
live
my
mortal
life
agin
i
be
a
pussyfoot
and
not
butt
in
my
mother
famous
for
her
pies
lies
buried
this
shaft
i
wonder
if
in
paradise
she
still
pursues
her
craft
she
be
too
much
engrossed
seem
in
picking
on
the
lyre
to
give
attention
to
a
scheme
to
bake
without
a
fire
but
if
perchance
she
had
the
dough
and
could
make
it
rise
i
sure
she
know
just
where
to
go
to
look
for
supplies
he
called
me
liar
like
a
flash
my
honor
i
defended
until
his
razor
cut
a
gash
so
deep
that
i
was
ended
if
i
could
live
my
life
again
i
not
invite
an
issue
but
say
when
villified
amen
and
thus
preserve
my
tissue
the
conquest
of
the
sun
the
morning
sun
with
golden
dart
crept
to
milady
bed
and
as
he
drew
the
screens
apart
a
halo
crowned
her
head
such
radiance
he
never
viewed
enraptured
he
surveyed
her
virgin
charms
beatitude
he
stooped
and
kissed
the
maid
entranced
because
her
splendor
seemed
to
dazzle
as
it
shone
he
conjured
all
his
wiles
and
beamed
her
burning
cheeks
upon
and
then
she
woke
milady
fair
enchanted
by
his
art
to
find
fires
a
there
his
dart
had
pierced
her
heart
and
so
the
morning
sun
can
gain
milady
when
he
tries
but
midnight
sons
must
lose
is
plain
because
they
late
to
rise
owed
to
a
roach
o
thou
who
thru
the
sink
doth
blithely
go
o
little
roach
how
could
you
so
low
who
pipeth
all
your
kin
from
kitchens
near
wherever
crumbs
of
comfort
may
appear
who
layeth
siege
in
mural
cracks
or
trenches
where
grease
spots
lure
or
rampant
be
the
stenches
who
hideth
in
the
dough
when
bread
is
rising
i
ask
you
to
a
feast
of
my
devising
to
eat
these
the
plumbing
placed
until
your
glutted
carcass
be
effaced
o
little
roach
if
you
would
selfish
be
and
not
ring
in
your
whole
fool
family
we
tolerate
you
nay
a
pet
would
make
you
if
you
not
scamper
all
our
pie
and
cake
thru
the
moods
of
the
winds
o
breezes
of
spring
how
they
rollick
and
ring
with
delight
as
they
sing
like
birds
on
the
wing
o
zephyrs
of
may
with
your
balm
and
bouquet
how
you
gladden
the
day
like
fairies
at
play
o
winds
of
the
fall
how
they
thrill
and
enthrall
how
they
hurtle
and
call
with
shrill
caterwaul
o
winter
bleak
breath
how
it
freezes
and
saith
to
the
wraith
shrouded
in
death
the
toxic
tippet
is
said
that
mary
she
of
reader
note
was
wrapped
up
in
her
lamb
her
lambskin
coat
after
his
demise
beatified
he
served
her
well
and
for
his
mistress
dyed
then
mary
died
and
took
angelic
form
because
the
lambskin
used
to
keep
her
warm
gave
her
the
anthrax
what
a
cruel
blow
to
be
thus
snatched
above
from
furbelow
psalm
my
shepherd
careth
for
his
flock
beneath
a
cloudless
sky
in
pastures
green
by
rock
in
luxury
i
lie
he
brings
contentment
to
my
soul
and
leads
me
to
the
light
by
which
i
see
the
goal
from
dismal
depths
of
night
though
poverty
attend
my
way
and
sorrow
fills
my
heart
thy
guidance
will
disaster
stay
so
good
and
pure
thou
art
thou
in
the
presence
of
my
foes
bestoweth
favors
rare
and
giveth
pleasure
and
repose
in
answer
to
my
prayer
to
such
a
shepherd
i
will
give
my
everlasting
love
and
glory
in
the
hope
to
live
with
him
at
last
above
friendship
true
friends
are
rare
who
counts
them
by
the
score
is
blest
indeed
for
we
have
seldom
more
if
we
possess
just
one
real
friend
who
shares
our
troubles
loyal
to
the
end
who
when
we
fall
will
help
us
to
our
feet
who
finds
with
us
contentment
most
complete
whose
and
heart
are
open
thrown
whether
we
need
affection
or
a
loan
and
makes
no
record
of
the
favor
done
but
gives
with
equal
pleasure
either
one
that
friendship
if
i
had
twenty
such
with
all
their
purses
open
to
my
touch
and
each
disposed
to
stake
me
and
forget
the
circumstance
and
measure
of
the
debt
i
soon
be
on
the
road
to
ease
and
plenty
but
wish
i
had
friendships
than
paramount
problems
shall
women
vote
shall
demon
rum
survive
or
be
thru
woman
suffrage
flayed
alive
these
are
the
questions
that
engross
the
nation
shall
women
vote
or
be
kept
on
probation
are
they
not
gentle
honest
sweet
and
kind
a
single
missing
virtue
we
ca
find
and
yet
we
say
stay
home
and
can
the
cherries
you
far
too
frail
and
fine
for
statecraft
worries
the
sacred
home
for
you
just
your
chicks
you
soil
your
hands
to
mix
in
politics
and
then
there
scrubbing
cooking
and
a
few
odd
jobs
besides
you
could
ballot
but
how
absurd
fair
woman
in
her
wrath
will
make
our
future
course
a
thorny
path
unless
we
meet
her
fairly
in
these
matters
she
tear
our
senseless
arguments
to
tatters
and
rule
home
and
state
to
suit
herself
putting
deceitful
upon
the
shelf
as
sure
as
death
or
taxes
day
or
night
she
have
the
without
or
a
fight
and
those
of
us
who
counsel
peace
as
best
should
not
oppose
and
put
her
to
the
test
and
when
she
the
vote
by
force
or
gift
the
clouds
obscuring
temperance
will
lift
for
all
the
wets
will
vanish
one
evaporate
like
mists
before
the
sun
true
women
drink
it
foolish
to
deny
it
but
not
as
men
do
as
a
steady
diet
they
take
a
punch
or
sip
a
little
claret
but
when
it
comes
to
liquor
they
ca
bear
it
and
so
we
ask
again
shall
women
vote
shall
men
surrender
to
the
petticoat
and
give
up
all
their
freedom
and
their
tipples
just
to
return
to
lacteal
life
and
nipples
the
war
is
on
nebraska
bids
defiance
to
rum
dispensers
and
the
booze
alliance
hereafter
all
our
barley
wheat
and
corn
will
be
quite
unresponsive
to
the
the
of
the
grain
will
be
tabooed
and
seed
accounted
for
as
no
more
will
barleycorn
assail
our
vitals
or
be
the
leader
in
our
song
recitals
no
more
will
liquor
check
our
ardent
thirst
and
so
we
go
from
bad
perhaps
to
worst
if
we
must
perforce
and
never
rum
it
what
will
befall
the
man
who
has
to
gum
it
whose
teeth
are
absent
and
who
food
eschews
drawing
his
daily
nourishment
from
booze
who
ca
obtain
a
single
drop
of
gin
to
comfort
and
sustain
the
man
within
pleading
for
drinks
unheeded
he
grow
wheezy
but
he
improve
his
breath
if
he
speak
easy
the
drunkard
fate
would
be
a
dreadful
warning
who
having
opened
riley
place
each
morning
found
one
cold
dawn
the
gone
and
read
soft
drinks
for
sale
where
schnapps
was
sold
instead
picture
his
sorrow
see
him
pallid
grow
when
told
the
facts
a
spectacle
of
woe
back
to
his
wife
he
slinks
he
could
face
her
because
he
missed
his
usual
morning
bracer
the
place
is
sold
it
now
a
candy
store
where
schnapps
will
be
dispensed
evermore
old
demijohn
decanters
too
his
life
will
empty
be
and
so
are
you
where
once
the
canteen
flourished
our
flag
now
prohibition
flags
the
soldier
jag
and
where
josephus
keeps
his
arid
log
the
has
succeeded
grog
some
commonwealths
already
have
the
pluck
to
ban
humanely
those
who
the
and
other
states
have
punished
rum
enough
to
have
compassion
on
the
stuff
thus
prohibition
grows
but
so
does
wheat
and
corn
and
rye
i
wonder
which
will
beat
but
what
of
woman
where
her
rightful
freedom
they
ought
to
have
the
vote
because
we
need
to
purge
our
land
of
drunkenness
and
crime
and
save
our
striplings
from
the
slough
and
slime
why
women
vote
perhaps
they
may
should
drunkards
or
illiterates
say
nay
could
citizens
of
foreign
birth
refuse
to
give
our
native
daughters
what
they
choose
our
native
sons
with
chivalry
invoke
fair
play
for
women
freedom
from
the
yoke
and
should
other
freemen
rise
in
flocks
to
help
our
women
win
the
ballot
box
the
trouble
lies
not
but
with
the
bosses
who
trade
in
graft
and
deal
in
the
sooner
we
eliminate
this
class
the
quicker
will
come
to
pass
but
watch
the
anti
make
her
hold
her
tongue
or
duck
her
in
the
pond
the
geese
among
or
lock
her
in
the
booth
without
a
mirror
where
she
ca
see
herself
and
we
ca
hear
her
thus
neck
and
neck
these
two
great
questions
lead
will
men
be
equal
to
their
country
need
if
one
reform
upon
the
other
waits
speed
equal
suffrage
to
the
white
house
gates
and
prohibition
farewell
dear
old
liquor
will
follow
as
the
tape
pursues
the
ticker
but
if
perchance
the
dry
should
get
a
trimmin
if
you
please
but
do
women
a
reunion
once
more
good
friends
we
gathered
the
board
to
feel
the
joys
of
fellowship
restored
there
nothing
like
them
ca
be
replaced
nor
thoughts
of
them
from
memory
be
effaced
of
course
we
form
friendships
but
i
feel
that
these
like
ones
are
not
staunch
and
real
it
takes
long
years
to
our
friends
you
know
those
who
are
steadfast
in
our
weal
or
woe
so
here
to
you
miss
prim
and
you
miss
prude
we
would
have
you
different
if
we
could
two
roses
rare
you
are
and
sweet
i
ween
you
were
not
doomed
to
bloom
and
blush
unseen
i
seen
your
cheeks
suffused
with
crimson
hues
dame
nature
is
the
rouge
you
use
i
seen
your
lips
in
saucy
challenge
perked
but
for
your
protests
they
be
overworked
i
seen
your
eyes
with
mischief
filled
and
tears
but
i
could
never
you
my
dears
i
seen
your
breasts
with
agitation
heave
your
must
be
affected
i
believe
i
seen
your
shapely
forms
pass
in
review
before
my
lonely
couch
in
dreams
of
you
and
what
i
have
seen
some
little
bird
has
told
me
all
about
upon
my
word
if
what
he
says
be
true
what
i
have
to
what
i
seen
methinks
would
be
preferred
then
here
to
friendship
what
more
potent
force
doth
link
mankind
together
love
of
course
doth
fetter
us
betimes
but
time
must
say
whom
we
shall
cherish
whom
to
cast
away
when
love
and
friendship
heart
and
hand
are
bound
what
more
of
joy
can
compass
us
around
so
friends
and
sweethearts
comrades
tried
and
true
we
pledge
our
love
and
loyalty
to
you
the
cruise
of
the
squirrel
somewhere
sometime
i
heard
it
said
or
read
that
fools
butt
in
where
angels
fear
to
tread
a
single
angel
with
a
pack
of
fools
is
not
enough
to
change
established
rules
and
so
i
think
the
angel
in
this
case
should
bear
alone
the
onus
and
disgrace
for
angels
should
know
better
than
to
swoop
upon
the
dove
of
peace
and
fowl
her
coop
the
good
ship
squirrel
has
left
our
shores
behind
to
measure
human
breath
ocean
wind
laden
with
nuts
her
clearance
shows
four
bells
she
off
to
fight
for
peace
with
all
those
shells
no
port
however
figures
in
her
quest
her
papers
show
and
this
is
manifest
the
dove
of
peace
perched
on
the
hath
disappointments
sticking
in
her
crop
the
peaceful
bird
is
shy
and
very
frail
ca
stand
the
weight
of
salt
upon
her
tail
the
war
has
made
her
nervous
and
the
roar
of
many
cannon
made
the
poor
bird
soar
up
springs
a
storm
the
dove
white
feathers
show
while
nuts
are
cracking
on
the
deck
below
and
then
an
iceberg
looms
against
the
sky
but
still
the
dove
is
far
too
proud
to
fly
but
when
anon
a
periscope
appears
the
bird
of
peace
is
overcome
by
fears
and
beats
it
to
the
iceberg
crystal
crest
where
she
prepares
to
build
her
neutral
nest
the
submarine
atop
the
billows
now
stands
by
the
squirrel
until
she
dips
her
bow
and
sinks
beneath
the
waves
then
looks
above
and
takes
a
parting
broadside
at
the
dove
the
angel
then
in
neptune
ascendeth
in
a
blaze
of
gasoline
the
dove
marooned
broods
over
many
things
nestling
her
poor
beneath
her
wings
regenerate
the
angel
has
returned
from
empyrean
flight
to
earth
and
learned
i
think
saint
peter
gave
him
sound
advice
to
keep
the
pacifistic
germ
on
ice
until
a
luther
if
there
still
remains

decent

filled
up
their
growler
with
double
x

and
jill
in
a

was
full
and
jack

both
had
a
thirst

the

his

grew

a
marvelous

till
he
soon
had

how

spared
at
his
nocturnal
spread
and
the
fumes
of
the
liquor
would
strike
in
his
head
till
knocked
off
his
pins
he
was
set
up
in
bed

his

old

lived
in
a
shoe
children
there
too
their
home
was
too
cramped
for
a
dozen
or
more
but
others
have
suffered
from
tight
shoes
before
so
the
was
always
hung
out
on
the
door
to
upper

good

with
all
her

lived
on

jack
gambled
with
hymen
and
drew
marguerite
and
love
for

there
was
a
comeback
to
poor
jack
and
jill
the
king
followed
after
them
going
down
hill
and
bo
left
alone
is
a
sheepish
maid
still
the
weight
of
love
i
was
sitting
in
the
parlor
with
my
sweetheart
on
my
knee
and
the
fireplace
lights
and
shadows
silhouetted
her
and
me
heavy
grew
she
towards
the
morning
when
the
sunbeams
leap
was
wide
awake
as
ever
but
my
leg
was
fast
asleep
flesh
is
weak
and
so
i
shifted
my
loved
load
as
best
i
could
from
the
numb
knee
to
the
other
from
the
leg
of
flesh
to
wood
then
i
felt
my
sweetheart
shiver
and
i
realized
her
state
when
she
drew
a
sliver
from
the
leg
do
it
dare
to
do
it
you
not
rue
it
if
you
save
some
human
craft
from
the
rocks
where
fierce
gales
blew
it
using
kindness
for
a
raft
o
dare
to
do
be
kind
and
true
to
the
friends
you
make
thru
life
then
high
heaven
will
reward
you
with
immunity
from

if
a

you
go

to
soothe

it
do
it
if

the

tied
the

that
made
two
halves
a

while
a
speculating
what
would
be
his
marriage
toll
the
groom
when
he
had
kissed
the
bride
was
taken
with
the
chills
her
icy
lips
could
not
abide
osculatory
thrills
but
soon
his
fever
was
effaced
his
hand
obeyed
his
will
and
in
the
parson
palm
he
placed
a
soiled
one
dollar
bill
anathema
the
preacher
cried
thou
reptile

the

replied

take

out
a

at

years
have
passed
since
i
an
urchin
drove
the
cow
so
sleek
and
prime
down
the
path
where
crows
were
at
the
bulging
udder
time
those
were
days
well
worth
one
living
when
i
watched
with
joy
sublime
what
the
generous
cow
was
giving
at
the
bulging
udder
time
later
on
when
we
grew
older
father
gave
us
each
a

me
and

to

and
her
at
the

time
but
alas
we
came
to

bill
was
kicked
and
smeared
with
grime
and
the

on

come
around
some
time
vagaries
the
husky
corn
has
pushed
ahead
with
silken

shocking
and
colonels

expecting
quite
a
bumper
bourbon

saloonward
they
are
flocking
but
when
they
strip
the
ears
and
find
the
wasteful
worms
surrounding
make
the
moonshine
dimmer
for
still
has
coils
of
worms
illicitly
abounding
where
mixtures
simmer
the
hillside
stills
their
fragrance

and
wood
birds
are
a
sounding
my
jug
is
in
the
hollow
so
fill
it
up
but
watch
your

and
secret

hounding
the

is
sweet
to
follow
the
cotton

a
shattered
romance
my
heart
is
aflame
with
a
love
that
enslaves
my
passion
for
thee
is
afire
my
soul
is
athirst
for
the
love
that
it
craves
and
you
are
the
one
i
admire
pray
speak
dear
and
say
your
affections
are
mine
and
all
the
sweet
charms
you
possess
then
i
will
surrender
my
wishes
to
thine
and
be
but
thy
slave
i
confess
when
she
answered
at
length
i
felt
very
sure
i
pleaded
my
cause
quite
enough
you
the
one
man
on
earth
i
so
cut
out
that
comedy
stuff
the
milky
way
i
went
to
school
like
any
lad
and
learned
to
read
and
write
with
pencil
books
and
i
grew
quite
erudite
promoted
soon
my
teacher
thought
i
would
some
day
be
great
and
so
painstakingly
he
taught
me
how
to
conjugate
and
talked
to
me
about
the
moon
of
venus
saturn
mars
till
i
was
rated
very
soon
authority
on
stars
a
graduate
i
searched
the
skies
for
orbs
unknown
before
determined
that
i
specialize
in
astronomic
lore
but
how
to
buy
a
telescope
and
all
the
charts
required
an
was
my
only
hope
of
all
the
things
desired
and
so
i
compromised
and
bought
binoculars
and
case
and
night
the
stars
i
sought
at
daly
burlesque
place
the
one
bright
meteoric
flame
in
all
that
stellar
group
soon
for
then
took
my
name
and
quit
the
burlesque
troupe
but
i
eclipsed
the
satellite
that
twinkles
in
the
crib
keeps
mother
day
and
night
a
didy
or
a
bib
the
logothete
beware
the
dog
beware
the
logothete
the
octoped
with
elephantine
feet
i
mean
by
this
with
the
the
byzantine
pup
of
theodore
branding
a
thousand
years
chained
to
hellespont
brink
he
never
once
whimpered
or
lapped
up
a
drink
hydrophobia
no
just
aphasia
he
could
cross
over
to
asia
the
old
logothete
is
the
watch
dog
of
state
he
feeds
upon
figures
he
cipher
an
eight
and
starts
meal
with
a
twelve
or
sixteen
then
multiplies
units
to
munch
on
between
voracity
thus
as
an
integer
stands
for
his
diurnal
gorge
on
multiplicands
numerical
strength
makes
the
logothete
thrive
and
fractions
he
dotes
on
just
eats
alive
he
lashes
his
tail
by
marmora
flood
but
eats
from
the
hand
of
sultan
ahmud
a
collar
of
gold
set
with
aquamarines
makes
him
the
envy
of
justin
his
the
hyphen
germane
rivals
the
harems
of
constantine
reign
innocuous
no
nor
yet
desuetude
for
he
daily
absorbs
whole
columns
of
food
his
teeth
are
as
sharp
as
the
damaskeene
blade
that
severed
the
chains
on
the
macedon
maid
and
as
keen
as
the
knife
avenging
the
dame
who
was
sold
to
the
sheik
in

but
the
point
that
i
make

arch√¶ologists
searching

unearthed
dogmatisms
and

sounds
of
the

resembling

snarls
of

and
thus
they
exploded
the
silence
complete
tradition
ascribes

so
in
unleashing
this
byzantine

they
merit
grave
censure

july
the
archaeologists
who
are
traversing
the
susquehanna
river
valley
visiting
sites
of
indian
villages
and
digging
up
aborigines
and
other
relics
are
said
to
have
made
a
most
astounding
discovery
on
the
murray
farm
near
here
in
finding
the
bones
of
men
the
average
height
of
these
men
when
their
skeletons
were
assembled
was
seven
feet
while
many
were
much
taller
additional
evidence
of
their
gigantic
size
is
found
in
the
massive
stone
battle
axes
in
their
graves
the
average
age
of
these
men
is
said
to
have
been
from
thirty
to
forty
another
amazing
point
of
this
discovery
is
the
allegation
that
perfectly
formed
skulls
were
found
from
which
horns
grew
straight
out
from
the
head
the
homestead
of
satan
they
say
has
been
found
near
athens
in
a
hole
in
the
ground
and
people
are
flocking
from
athens
and
sayre
to
view
the
remains
of
their
ancestors
there
when
satan
established
himself
in
this
zone
he
found
it
distasteful
to
live
all
alone
so
he
went
to
towanda
in
quest
of
a
bride
and
then
tilled
the
soil
till
his
seed
multiplied
so
scores
of
young
devils
at
murray
were
born
that
measured
five
cubits
between
hoof
and
horn
each
one
was
equipped
with
a
tail
and
two
wings
and
at
nick
sulphur
springs
and
that
why
you
find
all
their
skeletons
here
in
good
preservation
but
is
it
queer
that
devils
at
athens
the
place
of
their
birth
were
the
sole
legatees
of
hell
upon
earth
but
devils
like
men
reach
the
ends
of
their
ropes
and
have
disappointments
and
unfulfilled
hopes
so
satan
discovered
too
late
we
are
told
the
climate
at
murray
was
too
beastly
cold
his
imps
all
contracted
pneumonia
and
died
so
he
buried
them
here
in
the
pit
side
by
side
near
athens
by
the
river
chemung
where
they
been
unmolested
till
now
and
unsung
and
there
their
bones
bleached
in
the
sulphuric
pits
until
arch√¶ologists
came
with
their
kits
and
made
excavations
not
thinking
of
harm
but
raising
the
devil
at
rube
murray
farm
now
satan
and
his
ossified
get
a
few
yet
remain
in

the

the

but
all
the
sweetness
that
the

adorns
protected
is

the

not

let

rest
on
your

and
entwine
these

rare
in

nestling
there
wake
my

so
let
love

happy
indeed
is
he
who

heedeth
not
the

of
those

from
his

stray

day

no
fervor
lacks
to
bless
his

he
shall
be
a
fruitful
tree
in
the

not

shall
withered
be
nor

but
those
who
follow
not
the

the

hath
decreed
shall
shrivel
and
decay
perforce
and

be
their

it
follows
then
that
those
who
sin
must
turn
again
to
clay

day
for

from

depart
shall

peace
but
revenge
peace
do
you
say
when
my
homestead
is
razed
and
death
stalks
the
fields
where
my
cattle
once
grazed
and
the
dear
one
is
dead
whom
i
courted
and
wed
the
joy
of
my
life
when
the
hearthstone
fires
blazed
peace
what
a
travesty
give
back
my
wife
and
the
brave
little
son
who
gave
up
his
life
that
she
might
escape
from
the
murder
or
rape
of
helmeted
hordes
in
the
unequal
strife
peace
where
is
my
father
cleaning
your
shoes
like
a
thousand
old
men
you
maim
and
abuse
he
was
true
to
his
land
so
you
cut
off
his
hand
and
left
him
but
or
famine
to
choose
peace
my
wounds
cry
aloud
never
i
say
till
your
legions
are
killed
or
driven
away
and
my
country
is
free
but
stay
what
that
to
me
since
all
my
own
loved
ones
lie
murdered
no
peace
but
revenge
here
is
my
gun
surrendered
o
no
for
its
work
is
not
done
when
my
bayonet
sting
smites
the
heart
of
your
king
and
your
are
flayed
peace
will
be
heredity
i
see
her
creeping
the
nursery
floor
a
dainty
babe
scarce
old
enough
to
realize
is
whom
i
adore
she
is
a
priceless
diamond
in
the
rough
again
i
see
her
playing
with
a
host
of
noisy
kindergarten
girls
and
boys
she
seems
to
me
the
fairest
and
the
most
refined
a
girl
without
alloys
and
thus
from
stage
to
stage
i
watch
the
maid
as
she
develops
like
the
budding
rose
and
then
ah
me
i
jealously
afraid
that
she
admires
me
less
than
other
beaux
and
then
anon
i
see
her
on
the
knee
of
willie
jones
i
think
she
should
oughter
but
then
my
courtship
days
come
back
to
me
like
her
ma
she
is
my
only
daughter
the
call
of
the
homestead
there
a
dear
little
spot
near
my
hoosier
hometown
where
the
mortgage
runs
up
as
the
buildings
run
down
that
i
love
to
return
to
a
restful
retreat
just
to
slush
around
there
with
the
mud
on
my
feet
there
the
forked
wormy
dead
to
the
bark
and
the
sickle
and
grindstone
brought
out
of
the
ark
and
the
shed
where
i
fled
with
my
illicit
pipe
to
assuage
when
green
apples
were
ripe
there
the
collar
and
churn
by
dash
day
by
day
and
the
chain
that
prevented
his
running
away
and
the
yoke
for
the
oxen
haw
buck
and
gee
bride
and
the
troth
for
the
squealers
the
beside
there
the
dovecote
unroofed
and
the
sweep
by
the
well
and
the
ooze
in
the
barnyard
and
smell
there
the
hayrake
and
silo
the
tin
weathervane
and
the
two
graves
where
the
old
folks
were
lain
and
the
are
there
and
the
cowpath
and
stile
and
a
few
hardy
scarecrows
remain
yet
awhile
and
the
taxes
unpaid
still
appear
on
the
book
of
the
county
collector
nathaniel
crook
so
i
keep
coming
back
to
my
old
hoosier
shack
to
inhale
the
sweet
mildew
of
hay
in
the
stack
and
to
drink
from
the
spring
where
the
abound
that
protect
the
young
cowslips
that
grow
all
around
now
the
mortgage
is
due
and
the
unpaid
and
i
ca
get
a
cent
for
the
place
i
afraid
but
i
love
to
return
here
at
vacation
time
just
to
revel
again
in
the
mud
and
the
slime
decimal
points
the
paleface
undertook
with
sword
and
gun
to
civilize
the
redskins
one
by
one
and
lo
attempted
with
his
bow
and
arrow
to
sap
the
paleface
of
his
very
marrow
as
fast
as
one
on
either
side
was
slain
another
took
his
place
to
fight
again
thus
both
the
warring
tribes
said
what
the
use
and
straightway
called
a
halt
and
signed
a
truce
then
paleface
planned
and
dug
and
of
course
a
pit
for
lo
without
resort
to
force
and
lo
in
turn
a
counter
plan
invented
to
clear
the
forests
where
the
paleface
tented
and
so
the
paleface
from
his
fullness
gave
a
cask
of
laughing
water
to
each
brave
and
lo
whose
giving
was
an
artful
knack
took
up
the
scent
and
sent
tobacco
back
so
time
discloses
how
each
plan
availed
which
won
at
last
and
which
in
order
failed
for
now
in
the
paleface
moves
about
while
lo
and
laughing
water
it
he
was
the
first
to
fly
darius
green
but
green
had
trouble
with
his
machine
and
failed
to
make
a
mark
for
lofty
flying
and
so
he
just
and
gave
up
trying
the
pickaninny
to
the
bayou
goes
and
caches
on
the
bank
his
homespun
clothes
then
headlong
leaps
into
the
pool
below
where
imps
of
darkness
destined
are
to
go
an
alligator
sees
the
urchin
dive
and
holy
moses
swallows
him
alive
not
thinking
that
the
afric
thus
caged
would
prove
his
match
and
master
when
engaged
but
so
it
did
for
fate
evolved
a
plan
to
snatch
the
charcoal
from
the
saurian
and
as
the
latter
spewed
and
lashed
his
tail
a
tale
like
jonah
wrestling
with
the
whale
the
lad
escaped
of
course
he
had
to
shout
some
so
overjoyed
was
he
at
such
an
when
aaron
burr
decided
to
invite
his
hated
rival
to
a
pistol
fight
he
knew
of
course
because
his
aim
was
wicked
that
his
opponent
in
advance
was
l√≠ck√©d
and
thus
the
scheme
of
providence
began
to
canonize
the
hamiltonian
had
mary
tied
her
lambkin
in
the
barn
there
might
have
been
a
different
kind
of
yarn
she
could
have
said
i
leave
you
with
the
bull
or
i
return
anon
and
pulled
the
wool
the
lamb
could
have
replied
what
all
this
for
i
meet
you
mary
in
the
abattoir
but
no
they
had
to
make
the
sheep
the
goat
and
tie
a
siren
bell
around
his
throat
and
make
him
go
to
school
kids
as
a
rule
would
rather
be
killed
than
go
to
school
had
nero
played
on
burning
rome
the
hose
instead
of
fiddling
while
the
blazes
rose
he
might
have
been
in
fame
retort
a
hero
firemano
primo
volunteero
nero
but
quite
another
part
this
c√¶sar
played
the
part
of
arson
in
red
robes
arrayed
he
watched
the
fire
in
all
its
flares
and
phases
quite
unconcerned
but
fiddled
on
like
blazes
but
nero
did
finish
what
he
started
because
while
rome
still
burned
his
e
string
parted
tho
julius
c√¶sar
wars
our
lives
inspire
this
c√¶sar
would
even
fight
a
fire
nor
would
he
lead
the
roman
legions
tho
he
was
reputed
skillful
with
the
bow
perhaps
the
from
the
burning
city
was
planned
to
hide
the
discords
of
his
ditty
and
when
at
last
this
king
is
placed
on
trial
this
verdict
will
prevail
his
work
was
viol
had
antony
been
less
a
marc
and
kept
his
armor
on
while
cleopatra
slept
he
might
have
been
a
conqueror
of
note
instead
of
captor
of
a
petticoat
and
traitor
to
his
country
judged
to
be
a
soldier
less
than
slave
to
lingerie
some
commentators
and
i
blush
with
shame
contend
that
cle
and
sheba
were
the
same
if
this
contention
true
as
i
surmise
it
follows
that
king
solomon
was
wise
and
so
was
sheba
when
she
left
his
regions
by
for
the
roman
legions
leaving
the
king
with
all
his
wives
and
breeders
to
pine
for
her
among
the
stately
cedars
i
not
quite
sure
but
who
the
bigger
dunce
the
king
or
marc
who
got
in
wrong
the
oldtime
reader
taught
us
but
this
refers
to
not
to
science
and
pointed
out
in
no
uncertain
style
examples
we
should
follow
or
revile
old
rover
for
example
was
to
me
the
highest
standard
of
true
loyalty
he
used
to
hang
around
the
playground
gate
and
there
for
bones
his
master
sit
and
wait
though
bones
poor
dunce
each
day
when
school
was
over
was
kept
and
spanked
but
waited
still
old
rover
the
reader
states
that
rover
too
was
fleet
and
never
knew
the
anguish
of
de
feet
and
had
a
face
so
honest
ear
so
quick
that
he
could
steal
a
bone
and
dodge
a
stick
that
all
the
reader
says
but
i
believe
he
grew
too
diabetic
to
retrieve
and
so
was
cast
aside
the
poor
old
brute
because
the
mange
affected
his
hirsute
was
driven
from
the
confines
of
his
birth
because
not
prized
great
scott
a
kennelworth
and
so
a
rover
still
thus
doomed
to
flea
far
from
his
home
and
consanguinity
but
cast
adrift
in
sinking
bark
o
setter
than
wienerwursts
or
sausages
is
better
there
was
a
time
when
henry
clay
awoke
to
see
his
fame
and
name
go
up
in
smoke
his
reputation
only
went
this
far
that
he
was
featured
as
a
choice
cigar
before
that
day
when
his
renown
was
ripe
he
also
was
distinguished
as
a
pipe
eliminating
all
attempts
at
joking
he
was
thus
honored
then
and
still
is
had

woman
of

leaves
a

hers
would
have
been
the

selfish
adam
took
her
to

the

was
dead

joined
the

then
knew
all

the

shocked
the

like
everything
all
praise
to

he
went

not
and
tho
he
flew

so
high
poor
richard

the

excelsior
the
bale
consigned
to
crook
upholsterer
marked
use
no
hook
was
not
curled

or
even
moss
nor
yet
a
mixture
or
a
cross
excelsior
this
davenport
was
made
to
wear
fine
leather
and
best
camel
hair
said
crook
a
patent
skin
all
right
but
all
the
hair
was
out
of
sight
excelsior
and
so
crook
sold
the
lounge
or
couch
to
some
poor
boob
with
pouch
and
also
sold
an
easy
chair
the
easy
mark
was
stuffed
for
fair
excelsior
and
thus
he
plied
his
artful
trade
a
better
craftsman
was
made
until
the
shavings
dyed
and
curled
resembled
hair
for
all
the
world
excelsior
o
baleful
occupation
his
the
way
he
made
his

he
sold

a

such

are
a
crime
i
get
my

by
but
all
his
hair
was
cut
in
maine
excelsior
and
then
a
fire
occurred
at
length
to
bolster
crook
financial
strength
the
that
mocked
the
incensed
air
mistaken
was
for
burning
hair
excelsior
beware
the
fibrous
heart
but
this
gave
crook
his
fiscal
start
and
now
a
tall

excelsior
her
and
him
her
her
birthday
i
not
say
which
one
but
i
have
known
her
twenty
years
or
more
when
courtship
days
were
joyously
begun
and
she
had
reached
her
sixteenth
year
before
and
so
her
age
is
no
concern
of
mine
she
may
have
dropped
a
birthday
now
and
then
but
surely
she
improved
with
age
like
wine
i
would
wish
her
in
her
again
and
she
my
pal
o
yes
we
love
of
course
but
feel
besides
the
joy
of
comradeship
that
finds
expression
at
love
very
source
in
language
of
the
heart
not
of
the
lip
and
so
she
is
my
everlasting
pride
to
beauty
very
pinnacle
she
grown
thru
life
we
seek
our
pleasures
side
by
side
her
heart
athrob
with
love
for
me
alone
him
o
yes
we
splendid
friends
old
jack
and
i
he
growing
grave
and
wrinkles
now
appear
where
once
the
smiles
his
cheeks
were
wont
to
ply
he
losing
all
his
energy
i
fear
i
married
him
some
twenty
years
ago
when
dancing
was
a
chief
delight
of
his
but
now
alone
i
trip
the
terpsic
toe
for
poor
old
jack
has
got
the
rheumatiz
he
aging
fast
i
see
it
every
day
he
fat
and
short
of
breath
yet
how
he
snores
his
few
remaining
hairs
are
for
nicotine
keeps
oozing
from
his
pores
he
seems
so
childish
but
i
humor
him
altho
my
friends
declare
i
such
a
dunce
wrinkled
rheumatic
bare
of
brains
and
vim
old
jack
you
were
a
good
one
the
philosophy
of
living
we
bivouac
here
and
barely
get
acquainted
until
the
furlough
ends
then
we
are
sainted
whether
our
acts
deserve
rebuke
or
praise
when
we
are
the
recollection
stays
of
virtues
only
vices
are
excused
but
to
the
pardon
is
refused
and
yet
alive
i
rather
be
unsung
than
any
saint
the
catacombs
among
tho
critics
flay
me
and
the
censors
sneer
better
so
than
praises
on
my
bier
and
so
we
walk
life
slender
rope
till
bing
we
slip
and
fall
or
someone
cuts
the
string
ambition
lures
us
but
the
pinkest
peach
is
always
just
beyond
us
out
of
reach
and
when
at
last
we
think
we
are
in
line
to
cross
the
threshold
lo
the
full
house
sign
we
never
quite
obtain
the
golden
urn
tho
rainbows
beckon
every
way
we
turn
who
ever
found
i
ask
you
all
he
sought
our
best
endeavors
ofttimes
come
to
naught
and
yet
we
trudge
along
loath
to
confess
we
only
groping
in
a
wilderness
plodding
the
sands
that
burn
our
feet
and
hurt
seeking
the
promised
land
our
just
desert
had
c√¶sar
reached
the
zenith
of
his
life
when
brutus
cut
his
friendship
with
the
knife
the
ladder
broke
and
he
was
headlong
flung
while
setting
foot
upon
the
topmost
rung
thus
picture
c√¶sar
giving
up
the
ghost
just
when
he
reached
the
pinnacle
almost
did
bonaparte
receive
his
proper
due
he
it
but
too
late
at
waterloo
he
played
with
fire
aroused
the
seething
crater
and
now
with
nick
inhabits
the
equator
so
we
conclude
delving
the
lines
between

the

as
much
distinction

be
bestowed
on
william

more
praise
to
him

the

held

eschewed

bite
the
of

hath
goodness
in
his

the
of
us
but
fails
put
to
the
test
so
in

we
strive
to
pay
the
price
for
fortune
frowns
or
fate
disastrous
dice
until
we
bankrupt
or
too
spent
to
wrest
long
treasure
from

chest
tho
life
hath
ups

downs
the
weeping

measures
to
incline

direction
without
switch
or
scantling
the
optimist
with

in
his

gets
more
enjoyment

thus
cheerfulness

as

need

a

we

and
thus
our

began
a
the

america
our

the
joy

it
the
rapture
when
we
say
we
who
are

and
can
understand
this
is
our
heritage
the
hewn
from
the
virgin
forests
by
our
sires
and
launched
by
giants
capable
and
true
our
ship
of

was
manned
when

fires
were
beacon
lights
by
sturdy
godly
crew
and
so
hath
kept
steered
by
the

her
steadfast
course
thru
shoal
or
blast
aloof
from
sirens
luring
from
afar
with

and

still
waving
at
the

here
in
our
land
where
plenty
hath
its
store
where
fertile
fields
teem
with
abundant
grain
hunger
casts
its
shadow
on
the
door
and
famine
hath
no
lodge
on

or
plain
in
truth
doth
luxury
with
plenty
vie
to
fill
our
laps
with
all
the
luscious
things
that
nature
doth
provide
loath
to
deny
the
satisfaction
that
such
bounty
brings
to
us
was
freedom
heritage
bequeathed
to
have

hold
while
life
and
pride
remain
and
so
our
sword
must
ever
be
unsheathed
to
guard
this
priceless
boon
from
hurt
or
stain
so
that
the
hosts
in

maze
who
fight
against
the

ruthless
spear
may
see
the
light
of
liberty
ablaze
diffusing
matchless
splendor
over
here
and
friendly
beacon
be
to
them
a
sign
and
bow
of

in
their
dismal

the
light
of
hope
eternally
to
shine
in

resplendent
galaxy
on

grim
starvation
at
the
board
presides
across
the

where
once
the
farmsteads
poured
autumnal
wealth
and
desolation
rides
rough
shod
along
where
tramped
the
prussian
horde
no

remains
the

are
stark

sere
the

barren
as

of
the

the

where
the
fragrant

hung
to
cheer
the
peaceful

desolate
where
death
his

has
flung
upon

wrecked

abound
where

heaps
of
carnage
rise
above

naked
bosom
of

denying

still
with

to

go
her

her

the
guise
of
kultur
hides
its
hoofs
and
horns
its
tail
and
spear
and
hideous
face
and
as
a
pious
priest
on
moslem
roofs
extols
itself
usurping
allah
place
what
blasphemy
obsessed
to
germinate
its
propaganda
its
infernal
cult
condoning
cain
offense
instilling
hate
it
strikes
with
poison
dirk
and
catapult
against
the
precepts
of
the
prince
of
peace
against
the
conscience
of
the
universe
but
hatred
lust
and
war
will
never
cease
until
god
sword
destroys
this
monstrous
curse
audaciously
the
priests
of
kultur
strive
to
spread
their
doctrine
but
the
graven
god
against
the
living
christ
can
not
survive
and
in
his
time
will
scourged
be
with
his
rod
and
so
our
ship
of
state
to
battle
hastes
all
sails
sheets
secure
and
taut
manned
by
a
stalwart
crew
stripped
to
the
waists
inspired
by
battles
that
our
fathers
fought
in
port
at
last
whence
lafayette
once
sailed
to
aid
our
fight
that
made
britannia
halt
they
take
their
stand
where
frenchmen
never
failed
to
hold
the
verdun
forts
against
assault
a
mighty
effort
this
to
send
our
force
three
thousand
miles
thru
sea
beneath
dark
skies
where
vultures
lay
their
course
to
face
the
foe
and
ransom
liberty
thru
sacrificial
offering
of
our
sons
to
arm
and
clothe
five
million
men
and
then
build
to
convey
and
feed
them
countless
tons
of
mighty
vessels
transports
merchantmen
to
furnish
in
addition
vast
supplies
to
allied
powers
whose
cause
we
have
embraced
to
hearten
them
to
strengthen
friendly
ties
and
stay
the
hand
that
layeth
europe
waste
a
task
indeed
but
let
it
not
be
thought
by
foemen
or
by
those
whom
we
befriend
that
liberty
our
trust
so
dearly
bought
will
not
be
guarded
to
the
very
end
tho
hercules
the
strong
should
heave
in
sight
and
challenge
us
to
tests
of
thews
and
nerve
we
enter
the
arena
in
our
might
and
win
new
honors
for
the
land
we
serve
for
antaeus
and
all
the
myths
of
old
whom
the
supermen
of
yore
engaged
were
never
half
so
mighty
half
so
bold
as
peaceful
freemen
righteously
enraged
and
all
the
modern
bullies
who
presume
to
dominate
the
world
against
the
right
must
see
their
doomed
to
blackest
gloom
when
truth
prevails
against
the
imps
of
night
so
let
us
fabricate
in
forge
and
mill
so
let
us
plant
and
nurture
grain
and
seed
so
let
us
labor
and
conserve
until
there
be
an
end
to
kultur
cruel
creed
each
one
of
us
must
fight
or
toil
or
save
be
our
battle
song
hardships
endure
and
gravest
dangers
brave
if
we
would
victors
be
