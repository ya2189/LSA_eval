love

its

even
as
he
hates
them
hates
both
them
and
me
for
loving
what
he
hates

would
destroy

scorn
of
all
his
cringing
crew

daring

to
save
what
he
would
slay

must

destroy

denieth

my

sets
at
naught

him
saved

at

uprisen

i
that
day
gave
him
the
counsels
which
his
foes
despised
unhappy
they
who
had
still
their
blissful
seats
preserved
and
their
olympian
majesty
had
they
been
one
with
me
alas
my
kin
but
he
when
he
had
taken
the
throne
and
chained
his
foes
in
wasteful
tartarus
said
no
more
where
is
prometheus
our
wise
counsellor
what
saith
prometheus
tell
us
o
prometheus
what
fate
requires
but
waxing
confident
and
wanton
as
a
youth
first
tasting
power
he
wrecked
the
timeless
monuments
of
heaven
the
witness
of
the
wisdom
of
the
gods
and
making
all
about
him
new
beyond
determined
to
destroy
the
race
of
men
and
that
create
afresh
or
else
have
none
then
his
vain
mind
imagined
a
device
and
at
his
bidding
all
the
opposèd
winds
blew
and
the
scattered
clouds
and
furlèd
snows
from
every
part
of
heaven
together
flying
he
with
brute
hands
in
huge
disorder
heaped
they
with
the
winds
weight
and
his
angry
breath
were
thawed
in
cataracts
they
fell
and
earth
in
darkness
deep
and
whelmèd
tempest
lay
drowned
the
waters
yet
on
the
some
few
escaped
and
some
thus
warned
by
me
made
shift
to
live
in
vessels
which
outrode
the
season
and
the
fury
of
the
flood
and
when
his
rain
was
spent
and
from
clear
skies
zeus
looking
down
upon
the
watery
world
beheld
these
few
the
remnant
of
mankind
who
yet
stood
up
and
breathed
he
next
withdrew
the
seeds
of
fire
that
else
had
still
lain
hid
in
withered
branch
and
the
blue
flakes
of
flint
for
man
to
exact
and
use
but
these
withdrawn
man
with
the
brutes
degraded
would
be
man
no
more
and
so
the
tyrant
was
content
but
i
despised
again
again
upheld
the
weak
and
pitying
them
sent

hope

of

fond
and
kind
from

descending
on
the
unhindered
rays
of
every

to
cheer
with

fair
their
unamending
pains
and
now
this
day
behold
i
come
bearing
the
seal
of
all
which
hope
had
promised
for
within
this
reed
a
prisoner
i
bring
them
stolen
from
heaven
the
flash
of
mastering
fire
and
it
have
borne
so
swift
to
earth
that
when
yon
noontide
sun
rose
from
the
sea
at
morning
i
was
by
and
unperceived
of
hêlios
plunged
the
point
i
the
burning
axle
and
withdrew
a
tongue
of
breathing
flame
which
lives
to
leap
on
earth
for
man
the
father
of
all
fire
to
come
and
hither
have
i
brought
it
even
to
argos
unto
king
inachus

having
chosen
above
all
mortals
to
receive
my
gift
for
he
is
hopeful
careful
wise
and
brave
he
first
when
first
the
floods
left
bare
the
land
grew
warm
with
enterprise
and
gathered
men
together
and
disposed
their
various
tasks
for
common
weal
combined
for
soon
were
seen
the
long
straight
channels
dwindling
on
the
plain
which
slow
from
stagnant
pool
and
wide
morass
the
pestilent
waters
to
the
rivers
bore
then
in
the
ruined
dwellings
and
old
tombs

dug
unbedding
from
the
wormèd
ooze
vessels
and
tools
of
trade
and
husbandry
wherewith
all
seasonable
works
restored
oil
made
he
and
wine
anew
and
taught
mankind
to
live
not
brutally
though
without
fire
tending
their
flocks
and
herds
and
weaving
wool
living
on
fruit
and
milk
and
shepherds

till

should
bring
back

to

and

now
at
these
gates
i
stand
at
this
mid
hour
when
inachus
comes
forth
to
offer
sacrifice
unto
his
foe
for
never
hath
his
faithful
zeal
forborne
to
pay
the
power
though
hard
that
rules
the
world
the
smokeless
sacrifice
which
first
shall
smoke

for
that

from
cruelty

mar
thy
work

there
is
a
right
way
and
a
wrong
in
laying

me
see
thee

seest
this
faggot

now
unbind
how
it
is
packed
within

i
see
the
cones
and
needles
of
the
fir
which
by
the
wind
in
melancholy
places
ceaselessly
sighing
are
strewn
upon
the
tufted
floor
serv
these
took
i
from
a
sheltered
bank
whereon
the
sun
looks
down
at
noon
for
there
is
need

things
be
dry
these
first
i
spread
and
then
small
sticks
that
snap
i
the
hand
pr
such
are
enough
to
burden
the
slow
flight
of
labouring
rooks
when
on
the
leafless
in
young
march
their
glossy
herds
assembling
soothe
the
air
with
cries
of
solemn
joy
and
cawings
loud
and
such
the
herons
will
bear
to
mend
their
airy
platform
when
the
loving
spring
bids
them
take
thought
for
their
expected
young
serv
see
even
so
i
cross
them
and
cross
them
so
larger
and
by
degrees
a
steady
stack
have
built
whereon
the
heaviest
logs
may
lie
and
all
of
wood
and
now
is
done
pr
and
now
is
done
what
means
it
now
is
done
serv
well
thus
is
rightly
done
but
why
is
so
i
can
not
tell
nor
any
man
here
knows
save
that
our
master
when
he
sacrificeth

saith

good
for

the
gods

it
and

it
not
and
then

have
chosen
to

hêra

bring
a
hymn
for
the

days
to
the

of

how
on

festival
the
gods
had
loving
strife
which
should
give
of
them
all
the
fairest
gift
to
the
wife

earth
said
fair
to
see
is
mine
and
yields
to
none
i
have
grown
for
her
joy
a
sacred
tree
with
apples
of
gold
thereon
then
hêra
when
she
heard
what
earth
had
given
smiled
for
her
joy
and
longed
and
came
to
see
on
dovewings
flying
from
the
height
of
heaven
down
to
the
golden
tree
as
tired
birds
at

flying
straight

on

boughs
was
where
on
tortured
hands
bearing
the
mighty
pole
devoted
atlas
stands
and
round
his
bowed
head
roll
and
night
and
stars
unmingled
dance
nor
can
he
raise
his
glance
she
saw
the
rocky
coast
whereon
the
azured
waves
are
laced
in
foam

the

stranger
thou
wert
come
to

that
which
thou
findest
wanting
join
with
us
now
in
our
sacrifice
take
food
within
and
having
learnt
our
simple
way
of
life
return
unto
thy
country
whence
thou
camest
but
hast
thou
skill
or
knowledge
of
this
thing
how
best
it
may
be
sought
or
by
what
means
hope
to
be
reached
o

i
wait
to
hear
pr
there
is
o

fire
on
the

this
day
in
on

there
is
fire
thou
sayest
pr
there
is
fire
in
on

this
day
pr
there
is
fire
on
earth
this
day
in
this
is
a
sacred
place
a
solemn
hour
thy
speech
is
earnest
yet
even
if
thou
speak
truth
o
welcome
messenger
of
happy
tidings
and
though
i
hear
aright
yet
to
believe
is
hard
thou
canst
not
know
what
words
thou
speakest
into
what
ears
they
never
heard
before
this
sound
but
in
old
tales
of
happier
times
in
sighs
of
prayer
and
faint
unhearted
hope
maybe
they
heard
not
rightly
speak
again
pr
there
is
o
king
fire
on
the
earth
this
day
in
yes
yes
again
now
let
sweet
music
blab
her
secret
and
give
here
is
a
trumpet
that
mocks
her
method
yet
is
but
the
word
maybe
thy
fire
is
not
the
fire
i
seek
maybe
though
thou
didst
see
it
now
is
quenched
or
guarded
out
of
reach
speak
yet
again
and
swear
by
heaven
truth
is
there
fire
or
no
and
if
there
be
what
means
may
make
it
mine
pr
there
is
o
king
fire
on
the
earth
this
day
but
not
as
thou
dost
seek
it
to
be
found
in
how
seeking
wrongly
shall
i
seek
aright
pr
thou
prayest
here
to
zeus
and
him
thou
callest
almighty
knowing
he
could
grant
thy
prayer
that
if
but
his
will
the
journeying
sun
might
drop
a
spark
into
thine
outstretched
hand
that
at
his
breath
the
splashing
mountain
brooks
that
fall
from
orneæ
and
cold
lernè
pool
would
change
their
element
and
their
chill
streams
bend
in
their
burning
banks
a
molten
flood
that
at
his
word
so
many
messengers
would
bring
thee
fire
from
heaven
that
not
a
hearth
in
all
thy
land
but
straight
would
have
a
god
to
kneel
and
fan
the
flame
and
yet
to
him
it
is
to
him
thou
prayest
in
therefore
to
him
pr
is
this
thy
wisdom
king
to
sow
thy
seed
year
after
year
in
this
unsprouting
soil
hast
thou
not
proved
and
found
the
will
of
zeus
a
barren
rock
for
man
with
prayer
to
plough
in
his
anger
be
averted
we
judge
not
god
evil
because
our
wishes
please
him
not
oft
our
shortsighted
prayers
to
heaven
ascending
ask
there
our
ruin
and
are
then
denied
in
kindness
above
granting
were
not
so
scarce
could
we
pray
for
fear
to
pluck
our
doom
out
of
the
merciful
withholding
hands
pr
why
then
provokest
thou
such
great
goodwill
in
long
denial
and
kind
silence
shown
in
fie
fie
thou
lackest
piety
the
god
denial
being
nought
but
kindness
there
is
hope
that
he
will
make
that
good
which
is
not
or
if
indeed
good
be
withheld
in
punishment
is
well
still
to
seek
on
and
pray
that
god
relent
pr
o
sire
of
argos
zeus
will
not
relent
in
yet
fire
thou
is
on
the
earth
this
day
pr
not
of
his
knowledge
nor
his
gift
o
king
in
by
kindness
of
what
god
then
has
man
fire
pr
i
say
but
on
the
earth
unknown
to
zeus
in
how
boastest
thou
to
know
not
of
his
knowledge
pr
i
boast
not

boast

thy
daring

thee

for

dare
beseech
you
pr
the
wrath
of
zeus
in

pretending
in
one
hand
to
hold
the
wrath
of
god
and
in
the
other

pr
thou
meanest
rather
holding
both
in

in
both

art
thou
and
incredible
pr
yet
impious
only
till
thou
dost
believe
in
and
what
believe
ah
if
i
could
believe
it
was
but
now
thou
saidst
that
there
was

may

the
heat
of
prophecy
like
a
strong
wine
shameth
his

with
exultant
speech
pr
thou
i
am
mad

on
thy

bends
to
aid
the
willing
fruits
of

promote

the

there
her
best

not
brim
the
golden
cup
of

thine

arms
lift
to
her

what
then
is
this
whose

capacity
outbids
the

prodigal
beauty

that
the

retiring
unamazed
within
their
quiet
chambers
sit
to
feast
with

imagination

look
forth

upon
the

fathering
of
this

mocks
at

the

oft
prompting
thy
secret
musings

now
shooting
his
feathered
fancies

cloudy
sleep
piling

among

stir
for
thee

being
of

shifts
has
stayed

know
that
if

it
and

not
thou
shall
find
sem
is
this
a

that
speaketh
thus

affliction
yields
his
soul
in

art
who
breakest
on
our
solemn
sacrifice
with
solemn
words
i
pray
thee
not
depart
till
thou
hast
told
me
more
this
fire
i
seek
not
for
myself
whose
thin
and
silvery
hair
tells
that
my
toilsome
age
nears
to
its
end
but
for
my
children
and
the
aftertime
for
great
the
need
thereof
wretched
our
state
nay
set
by
what
has
been
our
happiness
is
very
want
so
that
what
now
is
not
is
but
the
measure
of
what
yet
may
be
and
first
are
barest
needs
which
well
i
know
fire
would
supply
but
i
have
hope
beyond
that
nature
in
recovering
her
right
would
kinder
prove
to
man
who
seeks
to
learn
her
secrets
and
unfold
the
cause
of
life
so
tell
me
if
thou
knowest
what
is
fire
doth
earth
contain
it
or
since
from
the
sun
fire
reaches
us
since
in
the
glimmering
stars
and
pallid
moon
in
lightning
and
the
glance
of
tracking
meteors
that
at
nightfall
show
how
in
the
air
a
thousand
sightless
things
travel
and
ever
on
their
windswift
course
flame
when
they
list
and
into
darkness
go
since
in
all
these
a
fiery
nature
dwells
is
fire
an
airy
essence
a
thing
of
heaven
that
could
we
poise
it
were
an
alien
power
to
make
our
wisdom
less
our
wonder
more
pr
thy
wish
to
know
is
good
and
happy
is
he
who
thus
from
chance
and
change
has
launched
his
mind
to
dwell
for
ever
with
undisturbèd
truth
this
high
ambition
doth
not
prompt
his
hand
to
crime
his
right
and
pleasure
are
not
wronged
by
folly
of
his
fellows
nor
his
eye
dimmed
by
the
griefs
that
move
the
tears
of
men
son
of
the
earth
and
citizen
may
be
of
argos
or
of
athens
and
her
laws
but
still
the
eternal
nature
where
he
looks
him
with
the
laws
which
laws
obey
and
in
her
heavenly
city
enrols
his
heart
in
thus
ever
have
i
held
of
happiness
the
child
of
heavenly
truth
and
thus
have
found
it
in
prayer
and
meditation
and
still
thought
and
thus
my
peace
of
mind
based
on
a
floor
that
doth
not
quaver
like
the
joys
of
sense
those
i
possess
enough
in
seeing
my
slaves
and
citizens
enjoy
having
myself
tasted
for
once
and
put
their
sweets
away
but
of
that
heavenly
city
of
which
thou
sayest
her
laws
us
have
i
little
learnt
for
when
my
wandering
spirit
hath
dared
alone
the
unearthly
terror
of
her
voiceless
halls
she
hath
fallen
from
delight
and
without
guide
turned
back
and
from
her
errand
fled
for
fear
pr
think
not
that
thou
canst
all
things
know
nor
deem
such
knowledge
happiness
the
fates
no
pleasure
have
who
sit
eternally
spinning
the
unnumbered
threads
that
time
hath
woven
and
weaves
upgathering
in
his
furthest
house
to
store
from
sight
but
what
is
joy
to
learn
or
use
to
know
that
thou
ask
of
right
in
then
tell
me
for
thou
knowest
what
is
fire
pr
know
then
o
king
that
this
fair
earth
of
men
the
olympus
of
the
gods
and
all
the
heavens
are
lesser
kingdoms
of
the
boundless
space
wherein
fate
rules
they
have
their
several
times
their
seasons
and
the
limit
of
their
thrones
and
from
the
nature
of

things
springing

changed
even
as

trees
or
birds
or
beasts
of
earth
which
now
arise
to
being
now
in
turn

and
die
the
heaven
and
earth

seest
for
long
were
held
by
fire
a
raging
power
to
whom
the
fates
decreed
a
slow
diminishing
old
age
but
to
his
daughter
who
is
that
gentle
goddess
queen
of
the
clear
and
azure
firmament

doting
years

to
outlast

be
the
pride
of
his
decay

to

sway

lost
domains

the

arrived

from

of
fire

waving
trunks
sucking
their
fuel
reared
in
branched
flame
roaring
and
their
torrid
shades
aye
underlit
with
fire

mountains
lifted

fell

followed
like

from

were
her
children

ruled
cronos
iapetus
hypérion
theia

and

that
are

names
whom
zeus
drave
out
from

with
his

on

thrones
in
there
is
no
greater
god
in

none

what

alas
what

this
that

should
know

take
it

therewith
shame

cry
down
the
unschooled
promptings
of
his
best
desire

beasts
that
have
no

confute
him

the
wild
hog
in

that
feels
his

hurries
straight
thereto
and
will
not
turn
his

in

thou
this
pr

hast
desired
the

canst
feel
how
hard
it
is
to
kill
the
heart

in

inachus
rise
against
zeus
as
he
rose
against
cronos
and
made
war
in

pr
i

not
so
yet
if
thou
didst
rebel
the
tongue
that
counselled
zeus
should
counsel
thee
sem
this
is
strange
counsel
sem
he
is
not
a
counsellor
for
gods
or
men
in
o
that
i
knew
where
i
might
counsel
find
that
one
were
sent
nay
the
least
of
all
the
myriad
messengers
of
heaven
to
me
one
that
should
say
morn
i
stood
with
zeus
he
hath
heard
thy
prayer
and
sent
me
ask
a
boon
what
thing
thou
wilt
it
shall
be
given
thee
pr
what
wouldst
thou
say
to
such
a
messenger
in
no
need
to
ask
then
what
i
now
might
ask
how
is
the
gods
if
they
have
care
for
mortals
slubber
our
worst
necessities
and
the
boon
no
need
to
tell
him
that
pr
now
king
thou
seest
zeus
sends
no
messenger
but
i
am
here
in
thy
speech
is
hard
and
even
thy
kindest
words
unkind
if
fire
thou
hast
in
thee
is
kind
to
proffer
it
but
thou
art
more
unkind
yoking
heaven
wrath
therewith
nay
and
how
knowest
thou
zeus
will
be
angry
if
i
take
of
it
thou
art
a
prophet
ay
but
of
the
prophets
some
have
been
taken
in
error
and
honest
time
has
honoured
many
with
forgetfulness
i
make
this
proof
of
thee
show
me
thy
fire
nay
me
now
if
thou
be
true
at
all
be
true
so
far
for
the
rest
there
none
will
lose
nor
blame
thee
being
false
where
is
thy
fire
pr
o
rather
had
it
thus
been
mine
to
give
i
would
have
given
it
thus
not
adding
aught
of
danger
or
diminishment
or
loss
so
strong
is
my
goodwill
nor
less
than
this
my
knowledge
but
in
knowledge
all
my
power
yet
since
wise
guidance
with
a
little
means
can
more
than
force
unminded
i
have
skill
to
conjure
evil
and
outcompass
strength
now
give
i
thee
my
best
a
little
gift
to
work
a
world
of
wonder
is
thine
own
of
long
desire
and
with
it
i
will
give
the
cunning
of
invention
and
all
arts
in
which
thy
hand
instructed
may
command
interpret
comfort
or
ennoble
nature
with
all
provision
that
in
wisdom
is
and
what
prevention
in
foreknowledge
lies
in
great
is
the
gain
pr
o
king
the
gain
is
thine
the
penalty
i
more
than
share
in
enough
i
take
thy
gift
nor
hast
thou
stood
more
firm
to
every
point
of
thy
strange
chequered
tale
revealing
threatening
offering
more
and
more
and
never
all
than
i
to
this
resolve
pr
i
knew
thy
heart
would
fail
not
at
the
hour
in
nay
failed
i
now
what
were
my
years
of
toil
more
than
the
endurance
of
a
harnessed
brute
flogged
to
his
daily
work
that
can
not
view
the
high
design
to
which
his
labour
steps
and
i
of
all
men
were
dishonoured
most
shrinking
in
fear
who
never
shrank
from
toil
and
found
abjuring
thrusting
stiffly
back
the
very
gift
for
which
i
stretched
my
hands
what
though
i
suffer
are
these
wintry
years
of
growing
desolation
to
be
held
as
cherishable
as
the
suns
of
spring
nay
only
joyful
can
they
be
in
seeing
long
hopes
accomplished
long
desires
fulfilled
and
since
thou
hast
touched
ambition
on
the
side
of
nobleness
and
stirred
my
proudest
hope
and
wilt
fulfil
this
shall
i
count
the
cost
rather
decay
will
triumph
and
cold
death
be
lapped
in
glory
seeing
strength
arise
from
weakness
from
the
tomb
go
forth
a
flame
pr
is
well
thou
art
exalted
now
the
grace
becomes
thy
valiant
spirit
in
lo
on
this
day
which
hope
despaired
to
see
hope
manifests
a
vision
bright
as
were
the
dreams
of
youth
when
life
was
easy
as
a
sleeper
faith
who
swims
in
the
air
and
dances
on
the
sea
when
all
the
good
that
scarce
by
toil
is
won
or
not
at
all
is
won
is
as
a
flower
growing
in
plenty
to
be
plucked
at
will
is
it
a
dream
again
or
is
it
truth
this
vision
fair
of
greece
inhabited
a
fairer
sight
than
all
fair
iris
sees
footing
her
airy
arch
of
colours
spun
from
ida
to
olympus
when
she
stays
to
look
on
greece
and
thinks
the
sight
is
fair
far
fairer
now
clothed
with
the
works
of
men
pr
ay
fairer
far
for
nature
varied
pleasaunce
without
man
life
is
but
a
desert
wild
which
most
where
most
she
mocks
him
needs
his
aid
she
knows
her
silence
sweeter
when
it
girds
his
murmurous
cities
her
wide
wasteful
curves
larger
beside
his
economic
line
or
what
can
add
a
mystery
to
the
dark
as
doth
his
measured
music
when
it
moves
with
rhythmic
sweetness
through
the
void
of
night
nay
all
her
loveliest
places
are
but
grounds
of
vantage
where
with
geometric
hand
true
square
and
careful
compass
he
may
come
to
plan
and
plant
and
spread
abroad
his
towers
his
gardens
temples
palaces
and
tombs
and
yet
not
all
thou
seest
with
trancèd
eye
looking
upon
the
beauty
that
shall
be
the
heights
the
wallèd
towns
farms
and
cool
summer
seats

the
broad
ways
that
bridge
the
rivers

sails

over
the
blue
of

thy

picture
what
shall
be

the
face

of
beauty

her
heart
and
life
shall
they
be
who
shall
see
it
born
to
shield
a
happier
birthright

intrepid
arms
to
tread
down
tyranny
and
fashion
forth
a
virgin

to
subdue
the
world

for
passion
an
eternal
song
to
shape
her
dreams
in

speech

hearkening

put
forth
in

the

up

prisoned

the
caverns
underground

or
bid
us
join
our
palms

mounting
morn

dance
across

fire

hope

impatient
of
vain
debating
sem
my
heart
is
stirred
at
the
name
of
the
wondrous
thing
and
trembles
awaiting
a
coy
inquisitive
spirit
the
spirit
of
wonder
possesses
the
child
in
his
cradle
when
mortal
things
are
new
yet
a
varied
surface
and
nothing
under
it
busies
the
mind
on
trifles
and
toys
and
brings
her
grasp
from
nearer
to
further
from
smaller
to
greater
and
slowly
teaches
flight
to
her
fledgeling
wings
she
flutters
and
falls
surprises
await
her
she
soars
and
beauty
miracles
open
in
sight
the
flowers
and
trees
and
beasts
of
the
earth
and
later
the
skies
of
day
the
moon
and
the
stars
of
night
which
she
scarcely
venturing
goes
demurely
with
mystery
clad
in
the
awe
of
depth
and
height
o
happy
for
still
unconscious
for
ah
how
surely
how
soon
and
surely
will
disenchantment
come
when
first
to
herself
she
boasts
to
walk
securely
and
drives
the
master
spirit
away
from
his
home
seeing
the
marvellous
things
that
make
the
morning
are
marvels
of
familiar
and
some
have
lost
with
use
like
earthly
robes
their
adorning
as
earthly
joys
the
charm
of
a
first
delight
and
some
are
fallen
from
awe
to
neglect
and
scorning
until
o
tarry
not
long
dear
needed
sprite
till
thou
though
uninvited
with
fancy
returnest
to
hallow
beauty
and
make
the
dull
heart
bright
to
inhabit
again
thy
gladdened
kingdom
in
earnest
wherein
from
the
smile
of
beauty
afar
forecasting
the
pleasure
of
god
thou
livest
at
peace
and
yearnest
with
wonder
everlasting
second
part
from
the
inachus
argeia
io
that
but
a
small
and
easy
thing
now
seems
which
from
my
house
when
i
came
forth
at
noon
a
dream
was
and
beyond
the
reach
of
man
is
now
a
fancy
of
the
will
a
word
liberty
lightest
prize
yet
still
as
one
who
loiters
on
the
threshold
of
delight
delaying
pleasure
for
the
love
of
pleasure
i
dally
come
argeia
and
share
my
triumph
and
set
our
daughter
by
thee
though
her
eyes
are
young
there
are
no
eyes
this
day
so
young
as
shall
forget
this
day
while
one
thing
more
i
ask
of
thee
this
evil
will
it
light
on
me
or
on
my
house
or
on
mankind
pr
scarce
on
mankind
o
inachus
for
zeus
a
second
time
failing
will
not
again
measure
his
spite
against
their
better
fate
and
now
the
terror
which
awhile
earth
its
black
wings
spread
shall
up
to
heaven
ascend
and
gnaw
the
tyrant
heart
for
there
is
whispered
a
word
gone
forth
to
scare
the
mighty
gods
how
one
must
soon
be
born
and
born
of
men
who
shall
drive
out
their
impious
host
from
heaven
and
from
their
skyey
dwellings
rule
mankind
in
truth
and
love
so
scarce
on
man
will
fall
this
evil
nay
nor
on

thy
name
shall
live
an
honoured
name
in
greece
in
then
on
my
house
be
thou
no
more
pr
know
i
no
more
ay
if
my
purpose
fail
is
not
for
lack
of
knowing
if
i
suffer
is
not
that
poisonous
fear
hath
slurred
her
task
or
let
brave
resolution
walk
unarmed
my
ears
are
callous
to
the
threats
of
zeus
the
direful
penalties
his
oath
hath
laid
on
every
good
that
i
in
heart
and
hand
am
sworn
to
accomplish
and
for
all
his
threats
lest
their
accomplishment
should
outrun
mine
am
bound
the
more
nay
nor
his
evil
minions
nor
force
nor
strength
shall
bend
me
to
his
will
alas
alas
what
heavy
words
are
these
that
in
the
place
of
joy
forbid
your
tongue
that
cloud
and
change
his
face
while
desperate
sorrow
sighs
in
his
heart
i
came
to
share
a
triumph
all
is
dismay
and
terror
what
is
this
in
true
wife
i
spake
of
triumph
and
i
told
thee
the
hope
of
my
whole
life
has
flower
in
amaranth
what
the
hope
thou
knowest
who
hast
shared
but
the
condition
i
told
thee
not
and
thou
hast
heard
this
prophet
who
comes
to
bring
us
fire
hath
said
that
zeus
wills
not
the
gift
he
brings
and
will
be
wroth
with
us
that
take
it
ar
o
doleful
change
i
came
in
pious
purpose
nay
i
heard
within
the
hymn
to
glorious
zeus
i
rose
and
said
the
mighty
god
now
bends
he
thrusts
aside
his
heavenly
supplicants
to
hear
the
prayer
of
inachus
his
servant
let
him
hear
o
let
him
turn
away
now
lest
he
hear
nay
frown
not
on
me
though
a
woman
voice
that
counsels
is
but
heard
impatiently
yet
by
thy
love
and
by
the
sons
i
bare
thee
by
this
our
daughter
our
last
ripening
fruit
by
our
long
happiness
and
hope
of
more
hear
me
and
let
me
speak
in
well
wife
speak
on
ar
thy
voice
forbids
more
than
thy
words
invite
yet
say
whence
comes
this
stranger
thou
not
yet
if
he
but
wish
us
well
he
will
not
bound
his
kindness
in
a
day
do
nought
in
haste
send
now
to
sicyon
and
fetch
thy
son
phorôneus
for
his
stake
in
this
is
more
than
thine
and
he
is
wise
well
phorôneus
and
ægialeus
were
both
here
maybe
they
would
both
refuse
the
strange
conditions
which
this
stranger
brings
were
we
not
happy
too
before
he
came
doth
he
not
offer
us
unhappiness
bid
him
depart
and
at
some
other
time
when
you
have
well
considered
then
return
in
is
his
conditions
that
we
now
shall
hear
ar
o
hide
them
yet
are
there
not
tales
enough
of
what
the
wrathful
gods
have
wrought
on
men
nay
was
this
very
fire
thou
now
wouldst
take
which
vain
salmoneus
son
of
æolus
made
boast
to
have
and
from
his
rattling
car
threw
up
at
heaven
to
mock
the
lightning
him
the
thunderer
stayed
not
to
deride
but
sent
one
blinding
fork
that
in
the
vacant
sky
shook
like
a
serpent
tongue
which
is
but
seen
in
memory
and
he
was
not
or
for
burial
rode
with
the
ashes
of
his
royal
city
upon
the
whirlwind
of
the
riven
air
and
after
him
his
brother
athamas
king
of
orchomenos
in
frenzy
fell
for
hera
wrath
and
raving
killed
his
son
and
would
have
killed
fair
ino
but
that
she
fled
into
the
sea
preferring
there
to
woo
the
choking
waters
rather
than
that
the
arm
which
had
so
oft
embraced
should
do
her
wrong
for
which
old
crimes
the
gods
yet
unappeased
demand
a
sacrifice
and
the
king
son
dreads
the
priest
knife
and
all
the
city
mourns
or
shall
i
say
what
shameful
fury
it
was
with
which
poseidon
smote
pasiphaë
but
for
neglect
of
a
recorded
vow
or
how
actæon
fared
of
artemis
when
he
surprised
her
most
himself
surprised
and
even
while
he
looked
his
boasted
bow
fell
from
his
hands
and
through
his
veins
there
ran
a
strange
oblivious
trouble
darkening
sense
till
he
knew
nothing
but
a
hideous
fear
which
bade
him
fly
and
faster
as
behind
he
heard
his
hounds
give
tongue
that
through
the
wood
were
following
closing
caught
him
and
tore
him
down
and
many
more
thus
perished
in
their
prime
lycaon
and
his
fifty
sons
whom
zeus
in
their
own
house
spied
on
and
unawares
watching
at
hand
from
his
disguise
arose
and
overset
the

its

withholds
not

thee

pardon
thou
and
these
who
still

not

which
will
sometimes
spur
the

to
extremity
till
it

that
there
is
any
joy
save
furious
war
nay
were
there
now
another
deed
to
do
which
more
could
hurt
our
enemy
than
this
which
here
i
stand
to
venture
here
would
i
leave
thee
conspiring
at
his
altar
and
fly
off
to
plunge
the
branding
terror
in
his
soul
but
now
the
rising
passion
of
my
will
already
jars
his
reaching
sense
already
from

bids
his

forth

his

rebel
to
his

no

not
believe
it
why
then
should
we
pluck
the

him

that

on

for
whether

consider
how
the
flowers
thy
miracles
of
beauty
above
praise
are
wither
in
the
moment
of
their
glory

that
of
all
the
mounting
summer
wealth

show
is
chang
each
day
and
each
day
dies
of
no
more
count
in

than
crowded
bubbles
of
the
fighting
foam

whether

the

whose
azure
waves
play
in
the

infinity
of
motion
ages
ere
he
beheld
it
and
will
play
for
ages
after
him
alike
is
sad
to
read
how
beauty
dies
and
he
must
die
per
were
i
a
man
i
would
not
worship
thee
thou
cold
essential
wisdom
if
as
thou
thought
makes
men
sorrowful
why
help
his

to
quench
enjoyment
who
might
else
as
i
revel
among
bright
things
and
feast
his
sense
with
beauty
nay
why
came
ye
to
share
my
pastime
ye
love
not
the

indeed
i
love
thee
child
and
love
thy

for
loving
wisely
all

whether
of

of

either
inform
by

obedient

seen
in
me
betwixt
the
extremes
there
lie
innumerable
alloys
and
all
of
evil
per
nay
and
i
guess
your
purpose
with
me
well
i
am
a
child
and
ye
would
nurse
me
up
a
pupil
in
your
school

know
ye
twain
of
all
the
immortals
are
at
one
in
this
ye
wage
of
cold
disdain
a
bitter
feud
with
aphrodite
and
ye
fear
for
me
lest
she
should
draw
me
to
her
wanton
way
fear
not
my
party
is
taken
hark
i
tell
what
i
have
chosen
what
mankind
shall
hold
devote
and
consecrate
to
me
on
earth
it
is
the
flowers
but
only
among
the
flowers
those
that
men
love
for
beauty
scent
or
hue
having
no
other
uses
i
have
found
demeter
my
good
mother
heeds
them
she
loves
vines
olives
orchards
rich
leas
of
wheat
rye
barley
vetches
oats
and
peas
but
for
the
idle
flowers
she
hath
little
care
she
will
resign
them
willingly
and
think
not
thou
wise
athena
i
shall
go
unhonour
or
rank
a
meaner
goddess
unto
man
his
spirit
setteth
beauty
before
wisdom
pleasures
above
necessities
and
thus
he
ever
adoreth
flowers
nor
this
i
guess
where
rich
men
only
and
superfluous
kings
around
their
palaces
reform
the
land
to
terraces
and
level
lawns
whereon
appointed
slaves
are
told
to
tend
and
feed
lilies
and
roses
and
all
rarest
plants
fetch
from
all
lands
that
they
these
lordly
men
flaunting
avenues
and
wafted
odours
may
pace
in
indolence
this
is
their
bliss
this
first
they
do
and
after
it
may
be
within
their
garden
set
their
academe
but
in
the
poorest
villages
around
the
meanest
cottage
where
no
other
solace
comforts
the
eye
some
simple
gaiety
of
flowers
in
tended
garden
is
seen
some
pinks
tulips
or
crocuses
that
edge
the
path
where
oft
at
eve
the
grateful
labourer
sits
in
his
jasmin
porch
and
takes
the
sun
and
even
the
children
that
go
have
posies
in
their
hands
and
of
themselves
will
choose
a
queen
in
whom
to
honour
spring
dancing
before
her
garlanded
with
may
the
cowslip
makes
them
truant
they
forget
the
hour
of
hunger
and
their
homely
feast
so
they
may
cull
the
delicate
primrose
sealing
their
birthright
with
the
touch
of
beauty
with
unconsider
hecatombs
assuring
their
dim
sense
of
immortal
yea
rich
and
poor
from
cradle
unto
grave
all
men
shall
love
me

adore
my

lies

stooping
towards

kneels
to
pluck
a

comes
to
sit
on

indifferent

strict
this
tulip
he
would
not

a
seventh
for
all
his

he
thought
to
attain
unique
magnificence
by
sheer
simplicity
a
pointed
oval
bare
on
a
stalk
erect
and

grown
old
he
will
his
young
idea
quite
abandon
in
his
dishevel
fury
wantoning
beyond
belief
some
are
this
poppy

four

like
a

thief

his
rich
silks
into

small
a

he
watch
a
creep
out
all
crumpled
from
his
trusting
the
sun
to
smooth
his
tender
tissue
and
sleek
the
velvet
of

so

between
such
different
schemes
such
widely
varied
loveliness

belov
most
intimately
mine
to
mortal

my
emblem
tho
i
never

she
is

darling
and
unkind
to
handle
set
her
choosing
for
odour
the
violet
were
mine
men
call
her
modest
because
she
hides
and
when
in
company
lacks
manner
and
the
assertive
style
of
worth
while
this
narcissus
here
scorns
modesty
will
stand
up
what
she
is
tho
something
prim
her
scent
a
saturation
of

her

symmetry
leaves
nought

ch
how
is
that
she
a

she
was
never

thus
nor
her

thus
and
her

it
in

treasure
it
beyond

is
as
the
jewel

in
the
earth
the

therefrom
the
plants

exhale
their

on

elaborate
their

from
these
twain
mankind

in
mankind

deeds
of
fond
compassion

in

built
up
a
story

then
while
i
parting
from

hence
anger
at
heart
from
the
forgone
alone
my
anguish
fasten
on
me
as
i
went
wandering
an
alien
in
the
haunts
of
men
to
screen
my
woe
i
put
my
godhead
off
taking
the
likeness
of
a
worthy
dame
a
woman
of
the
people
well
in
years
till
going
unobserv
it
irked
me
soon
to
be
unoccupy
save
by
my
grief
while
men
might
find
distraction
for
their
sorrows
in
useful
toil
then
of
my
pity
rather
than
hope
to
find
their
simple
cure
my
own
i
took
resolve
to
share
and
serve
their
needs
and
be
as
one
of
them
ch
ah
mighty
goddess
coudst
thou
so
put
thy
dignities
away
and
suffer
the
familiar
brunt
of
men
dem
in
all
things
even
as
and
sitting
down
one
evening
at
eleusis
by
the
well
under
an
likening
myself
outwardly
to
some
matron
whose
wisdom
and
experience
are
of
worth
either
where
childhood
clamorously
speaks
the
engrossing
charge
of
aphrodite
gifts
or
merry
maidens
in
halls
want
sober
governance
to
me
as
there
i
sat
the
daughters
of
king
keleos
came
tall
noble
damsels
as
kings
daughters
are
and
marking
me
a
stranger
they
drew
from
me
a
tale
told
so
engagingly
that
they
grew
fain
to
find
employment
for
my
skill
as
men
devise
in
mutual
recompense
hoping
the
main
advantage
for
themselves
and
so
they
bad
me
follow
and
i
the
palace
of
king
keleos
and
received
there
on
my
knees
the
youngest
of
the
house
a
babe
to
nurse
him
as
a
mother
would
and
in
that
menial
service
i
was
proud
to
outrun
duty
and
trust
and
there
i
disguised
among
the
maidens
many
months
ch
often
as
have
our
guesses
aim
dear
lady
where
thou
didst
hide
thyself
oft
as
we
wonder
what
chosen
work
was
thine
none
ever
thought
that
thou
didst
deign
to
tend
a
mortal
babe
dem
what
life
i
led
shall
be
for
men
to
tell
but
for
this
babe
the
nursling
of
my
sorrow
whose
peevish
cry
was
my
consoling
care
how
much
i
came
to
love
him
ye
shall
hear
ch
what
was
he
named
lady
dem
demophoön
yea
ye
shall
hear
how
much
i
came
to
love
him
for
in
his
small
epitome
i
read
the
trouble
of
mankind
in
him
i
saw
the
hero
helplessness
the
countless
perils
in
ambush
of
life
promise
the
desire
blind
and
instinctive
and
the
will
perverse
his
petty
needs
were
man
necessities
in
him
i
nurst
all
mortal
natur
with
whole
affection
to
my
breast
and
wailing
humanity
upon
my
knee
ch
we
see
thou
wilt
not
now
destroy
mankind
dem
what
i
coud
do
to
save
man
was
my
thought
and
since
my
love
was
center
in
the
boy
my
thought
was
first
for
him
to
rescue
him
that
thro
my
providence
he
should
know
suffering
nor
disease
nor
fear
of
death
therefore
i
fed
him
on
immortal
food
and
should
have
gain
my
wish
so
well
he
throve
but
by
it
hapt
once
as
i
held
him
bathed
in
the
fire
at
midnight
as
was
my
wont
his
mother
stole
upon
us
and
ascare
at
the
strange
sight
screaming
in
loud
dismay
compel
me
to
unmask
and
leave
for
ever
the
halls
of
keleos
and
my
work
undone
ch
was
pity
that
she
came
didst
thou
not
grieve
to
lose
the
small
demophoön
coudst
thou
not
save
him
dem
i
had
been
blinded
think
ye
for
yourselves
what
vantage
were
it
to
mankind
at
large
that
one
should
be
immortal
if
all
beside
must
die
and
suffer
misery
as
before
ch
nay
truly
and
great
envy
borne
to
one
so
favour
might
have
more
embitter
all
dem
i
had
been
foolish
my
sojourn
with
men
had
warpt
my
mind
with
mortal
tenderness
so
questioning
myself
what
real
gift
i
might
bestow
on
man
to
help
his
state
i
saw
that
sorrow
was
his
to
be
bravely
not
weakly
shun
that
as
by
toil
man
winneth
happiness
thro
tribulation
he
must
come
to
peace
how
to
make
sorrow
his
friend
then
this
my
task
here
was
a
mystery
and
how
persuade
this
thorny
truth
ye
do
not
hearken
me
ch
yea
honour
goddess
yea
we
hearken
still
stint
not
thy
tale
dem
ye
might
not
understand
my
tale
to
you
must
be
a
tale
of
deeds
how
first
i
bade
king
keleos
build
for
me
a
temple
in
eleusis
and
my
worship
and
the
mysteries
of
my
thought
where
in
the
sorrow
that
i
underwent
man
state
is
pattern
and
in
picture
shewn
the
way
of
his
salvation
now
with
me
here
is
a
matter
grateful
to
your
ears
your
lov
persephone

equal
honour
and
in
the
spring

and
evermore
shall
be
restor
to
thee

on
this
day

hades
holding
to
his
bride
the
fates
were
kind
also
to
him
that
she
should
be
his
queen
in

as
thy
child
on

yearly
as
cometh
she
is
thine
while
flowers
bloom
and
all
the

is
gay
but
when
thy
corn
is
gather
and
the
fields
are
bare
and
earth
withdraws
her
budding
life
from
the
sharp
bite
of
winter
angry
fang
yearly
will
she
return
and
hold
her
throne
with
great
aidoneus
and
the
living
dead
and
she
hath
eaten
with
him
of
such
fruit
as
holds
her
his
true
bride
for
evermore
dem
alas
alas
per
rejoice
dear
mother
let
not
vain
lament
trouble
our
joy
this
day
nor
idle
tears
dem
alas
from
my
own
deed
my
trouble
comes
he
gave
thee
of
the
fruit
which
i
had
curs
i
made
the
poison
that
enchanted
thee
per
repent
not
in
thy
triumph
but
rejoice
who
hast
thy
will
in
all
as
i
have
mine
dem
i
have
but
half
my
will
how
hast
thou
more
per
it
was
my
childish
fancy
thou
i
would
be
goddess
of
the
flowers
i
thought
that
men
should
innocently
honour
me
with
bloodless
sacrifice
and
joy
now
fate
that
look
contrary
hath
my
project
with
mysterious
efficacy
and
as
a
plant
that
yearly
dieth
down
when
summer
is
and
hideth
in
the
earth
nor
showeth
promise
in
its
wither
leaves
that
it
shall
reawaken
and
put
forth
its
blossoms
any
more
to
deck
the
spring
so
i
the
mutual
symbol
of
my
choice
shall
die
with
winter
and
with
spring
revive
how
without
winter
coud
i
have
my
spring
how
come
to
resurrection
without
death
lo
thus
our
joyful
meeting
of
born
of
our
separation
shall
renew
its
annual
ecstasy
by
grief
refresht
and
no
more
pall
than
doth
the
joy
of
spring
yearly
returning
to
the
hearts
of
men
see
then
the
accomplishment
of
all
my
hope
rejoice
and
think
not
to
put
off
my
crown
dem
what
hast
thou
seen
below
to
reconcile
thee
to
the
dark
moiety
of
thy
strange
fate
per
where
have
i
been
mother
what
have
i
seen
the
downward
pathway
to
the
gates
of
death
the
skeleton
of
earthly
being
stript
of
all
disguise
the
sudden
void
of
night
the
spectral
records
of
unwholesome
fear
why
was
it
given
to
me
to
see
these
things
the
ruin
godheads
disesteem
to
toil
of
deathless
mockery
conquerors
in
the
reverse
of
glory
doom
to
rule
the
multitudinous
army
of
their
crimes
the
naked
retribution
of
all
wrong
why
was
it
given
to
me
to
see
such
things
dem
not
without
terror
as
i
think
thou
speakest
nor
as
one
reconcil
to
brook
return
per
but
since
i
have
seen
these
things
with
salt
and
fire
my
spirit
is
purged
and
by
this
crystal
crown
terror
is
tamed
within
me
if
my
words
seem
to
be
tinged
with
terror
was
because
i
knew
one
hour
of
terror
on
the
day
that
took
me
hence
and
with
that
memory
colour
my
speech
using
the
terms
which
paint
the
blindfold
fears
of
men
who
little
reckon
how
they
by
holy
innocence
and
love
by
reverence
and
gentle
lives
may
win
a
title
to
the
fair
elysian
fields
where
the
good
spirits
dwell
in
ease
and
light
and
entertainment
of
those
fair
desires
that
made
earth
beautiful
brave
souls
that
spent
their
lives
for
liberty
and
truth
grave
seers
whose
vision
conquer
darkness
pious
poets
whose
words
have
won
apollo
deathless
praise
who
all
escape
hell
mysteries
nor
come
nigh
the
cave
of
cacophysia
dem
mysteries
what
mysteries
are
these
and
what
the
cave
per
the
mysteries
of
evil
and
the
cave
of
blackness
that
obscures
them
even
in
hell
the
worst
is
hidden
and
unfructuous
night
stifles
her
essence
in
her
truthless
heart
dem
what
is
the
i
seek
to
know
the
mystery
of
evil
hast
thou
seen
it
per
i
have
seen
it
coud
i
truly
rule
my
kingdom
not
having
seen
it
dem
tell
me
what
it
is
per
is
not
that
i
forget
it
tho
the
thought
is
banisht
from
me
but
is
like
a
dream
whose
sense
is
an
impression
lacking
words
dem
if
it
would
pain
thee
telling
per
nay
but
surely
the
words
of
gods
and
men
are
names
of
things
and
thoughts
accustom
but
of
things
unknown
and
unimagin
are
no
words
at
all
dem
and
yet
will
words
sometimes
outrun
the
thought
per
what
can
be
spoken
is
nothing
a
path
that
leading
some
prospect
arrived
dem
the
more
thou
holdest
back
the
more
i
long
per
the
outward
aspect
only
mocks
my
words
dem
yet
what
is
outward
easy
is
to
tell
per
something
is
possible
this
cavern
lies
in
very
midmost
of
hell
its
torn
mouth
the
black
plutonic
rock
is
split
in
sharp
disorder
pinnacles
and
broken
ledges
whereon
sit
like
apes
upon
a
wither
tree
the
hideous
sins
of
all
the
world
once
having
seen
within
the
magnetism
is
heavy
on
them
and
they
crawl
palsied
with
filthy
thought
upon
the
peaks
or
squatting
thro
long
ages
have
become
rooted
like
plants
into
the
griping
clefts
and
there
they
pullulate
and
moan
and
strew
the
rock
with
fragments
of
their
mildew
growth
dem
cora
my
child
and
hast
thou
seen
these
things
per
nay
but
the
outward
aspect
figur
thus
in
mere
material
loathsomeness
is
nought
beside
the
mystery
that
is
hid
within
dem
search
thou
for
words
i
pray
somewhat
to
tell
per
are
there
not
matters
past
the
thought
of
men
or
gods
to
know
dem
thou
meanest
wherefore
things
should
be
at
all
or
if
they
be
why
thus
as
hot
cold
hard
and
soft
and
wherefore
zeus
had
but
two
brothers
why
the
stars
of
heaven
are
so
innumerable
constellated
just
as
they
are
or
why
this
sicily
should
be
yes
thou
sayest
well
why
things
are
as
they
are
nor
gods
nor
men
can
know
we
say
that
fate
appointed
thus
and
are
per
suppose
dear
mother
there
wer
a
temple
in
heaven
which
dedicated
to
the
unknown
cause
and
worship
of
the
unseen
had
power
to
draw
all
that
was
worthy
and
good
within
its
gate
and
that
the
spirits
who
enter
there
became
not
only
purified
and
comforted
but
that
the
mysteries
of
the
shrine
were
such
that
the
initiated
bathed
in
light
of
infinite
intelligence
and
saw
the
meaning
and
the
reason
of
all
things
all
at
a
glance
distinctly
and
perceived
the
origin
of
all
things
to
be
good
and
the
énd
good
and
that
what
appears
as
evil
is
as
a
film
of
dust
that
faln
thereon
may
at
one
stroke
of
the
hand
be
brush
away
and
show
the
good
beneath
solid
and
fair
and
shining
if
moreover
this
blessëd
vision
were
of
so
great
power
that
none
coud
forget
it
or
relapse
to
doubtful
ignorance
i
say
dear
mother
suppose
that
there
were
such
a
temple
in
heaven
dem
o
child
my
child
that
were
a
temple
indeed
is
such
a
temple
as
man
needs
on
earth
a
holy
shrine
that
makes
no
pact
with
sin
a
worthy
shrine
to
draw
the
worthy
and
good
a
shrine
of
wisdom
trifling
not
with
folly
a
shrine
of
beauty
where
the
initiated
drank
love
and
light
strange
thou
shouldst
speak
of
it
i
have
inaugurated
such
a
temple
these
last
days
in
eleusis
have
these
very
mysteries
strange
thou
speakest
of
it
but
by
what
path
return
we
to
the
cave
of
cacophysia
per
by
this
path
dear
mother
the
cave
of
cacophysia
is
in
all
things
evil
as
that
temple
were
good
i
enter
in
outside
the
darkness
was
but
as
accumulated
sunlessness
within
was
positive
as
light
itself
a
blackness
that
extinguished
yet
i
knew
for
hades
told
me
that
i
was
to
see
and
so
i
waited
till
a
forking
flash
of
sudden
lightning
dazzlingly
all
at
a
glance
as
on
a
pitchy
night
the
warder
of
some
high
acropolis
looks
down
into
the
dark
and
suddenly
sees
all
the
city
with
its
roofs
and
streets
houses
and
walls
clear
as
in
summer
noon
and
ere
he
think
of
it
is
dark
again
so
i
saw
all
within
the
cave
and
held
the
vision
was
so
burnt
upon
my
sense
dem
what
thou
child
what
thou
per
nay
the
things
not
to
be
told
because
there
are
no
words
of
gods
or
men
to
paint
the
inscrutable
and
full
initiation
of
i
saw
the
meaning
and
the
reason
of
all
things
all
at
a
glance
and
in
that
glance
the
origin
of
all
things
to
be
evil
and
the
énd
evil
that
what
seems
as
good
is
as
a
bloom
of
gold
that
spread
may
by
one
stroke
of
the
hand
be
brush
away
and
leave
the
ill
beneath
solid
and
foul
and
black
dem
now
tell
me
child
if
hades
love
thee
that
he
sent
thee
thither
per
he
said
it
coud
not
harm
me
and
i
think
it
hath
not
up
to
demeter
who
kisses
dem
nay
it
hath
not
and
i
know
the
power
of
evil
is
no
power
at
all
against
eternal
good
is
fire
on
water
as
darkness
against
sunlight
like
a
dream
to
waken
will
foolish
was
i
to
fear
that
aught
coud
hurt
thee
cora
but
speak
we
no
more
this
mystery
of
hell
will
do
me
service
i
not
tell
thee
now
but
sure
it
is
that
fate
all
for
good
or
ill
and
we
no
more
than
men
have
power
to
oppose
nor
any
will
nor
choice
beyond
such
wisdom
as
a
fisher
hath
who
driven
by
sudden
gale
far
out
to
sea
handles
his
fragile
boat
safe
thro
the
waves
making
what
harbour
the
wild
storm
allows
and
inscrutable
fate
stands
to
mine
eyes
reveal
nor
frowns
upon
me
i
thought
to
find
thee
as
i
knew
thee
and
only
to
find
thee
sorrowful
i
find
thee
far
other
than
thou
wert
nor
hurt
by
hell
i
thought
i
must
console
thee
but
is
thou
playest
the
comforter
i
thought
to
teach
thee
and
had
prepared
my
lesson
word
by
word
but
thou
art
still
beyond
me
one
thing
only
of
all
my
predetermin
plan
endures
my
purpose
was
to
bid
thee
to
eleusis
for
thy
spring
festival
which
three
days
hence
inaugurates
my
temple
thou
wilt
come
per
i
come
and
art
thou
reconcil
dear
mother
dem
joy
and
surprise
make
tempest
in
my
mind
when
their
bright
stir
is
there
will
be
peace
but
ere
we
leave
this
flowery
field
the
scene
of
strange
and
beauteous
memories

so
before

went
hushing

a

ran
and
silent
heads
were

bent

from
the

the
belief
began
that
love
own

had

down

a

latin
lore
what
the
first
dawn
of
manhood
is
the
hour
when
beauty
from
its
fleshy
bud
unpent
flaunts
like
the
corol
of
a
summer
flower
as
if
all
life
were
for
that
ornament
such
eros
seemed
in
years
a
trifler
gay
the
prodigal
of
an
immortal
day
for
ever
spending
and
yet
never
spent
his
skin
is
brilliant
with
the
nimble
flood
of
ichor
that
comes
dancing
from
his
heart
lively
as
fire
and
redder
than
the
blood
and
maketh
in
his
eyes
small
flashes
dart
and
curleth
his
hair
golden
and
distilleth
honey
on
his
tongue
and
all
his
body
filleth
with
wanton
lightsomeness
in
every
part
naked
he
goeth
but
with
sprightly
wings
red
iridescent
are
his
shoulders
fledged
a
bow
his
weapon
which
he
deftly
strings
and
little
arrows
barb
and
keenly
edged
and
these
he
shooteth
true
but
else
the
youth
for
all
his
seeming
recketh
naught
of
truth
but
most
deceiveth
where
he
most
is
pledged
is
he
that
maketh
in
men
heart
a
strife
between
remorseful
reason
and
desire
till
with
life
lost
they
lose
the
love
of
life
and
by
their
own
hands
wretchedly
expire
or
slain
in
bloody
rivalries
they
miss
even
the
short
embracement
of
their
bliss
his
smile
of
fury
and
his
kiss
of
fire
he
makes
the
strong
man
weak
the
weak
man
wild
ruins
great
business
and
purpose
high
brings
down
the
wise
to
folly
reconciled
and
martial
captains
on
their
knees
to
sigh
he
changeth
dynasties
and
on
the
head
of
duteous
heroes
who
for
honour
bled
smircheth
the
laurel
that
can
never
die
him
then
she
call
and
gravely
kissing
told
the
great
dishonour
to
her
godhead
done
and
how
if
he
from
that
in
heaven
would
hold
on
earth
he
must
maintain
it
as
her
son
the
rather
that
his
weapons
were
most
fit
as
was
his
skill
ordain
to
champion
it
and
flattering
thus
his
ready
zeal
she
won
whereon
she
quickly
led
him
down
on
earth
and
show
him
psyche
thus
the
maid
was
named
whom
when
she
show
but
coud
not
hide
her
worth
she
grew
with
envy
tenfold
more
enflamed
if
she
cried
smite
her
as
i
bid
soon
shall
our
glory
of
this
affront
be
rid
and
she
and
all
her
likes
for
ever
shamed
her
to
love
the
loathliest
basest
wretch
deform
in
body
and
of
moonstruck
mind
a
hideous
brute
and
vicious
born
to
fetch
anger
from
dogs
and
cursing
from
the
blind
and
let
her
passion
for
the
monster
be
as
shameless
and
detestable
as
he
is
most
extreme
and
vile
of
humankind
which
said
when
he
agreed
she
spake
no
more
but
left
him
to
his
task
and
took
her
way
beside
the
ripples
of
the
shore
the
southward
stretching
margin
of
a
bay
whose
sandy
curves
she
pass
and
taking
stand
upon
its
taper
horn
of
furthest
land
lookt
left
and
right
to
rise
and
set
of
day
fair
was
the
sight
for
now
though
full
an
hour
the
sun
had
sunk
she
saw
the
evening
light
in
shifting
colour
to
the
zenith
tower
and
grow
more
gorgeous
ever
and
more
bright
bathed
in
the
warm
and
comfortable
glow
the
fair
delighted
queen
forgot
her
woe
and
watch
the
unwonted
pageant
of
the
night
broad
and
low
down
where
late
the
sun
had
been
a
wealth
of
was
thickly
shed
fading
above
into
a
field
of
green
like
apples
ere
they
ripen
into

then
to
the

a
variable
hue
of
rose

with

round
the
blazing

the
splendour
soon
caught
all

and
ran
to

and
aphrodite
knew
the
thing
was
wrought
by
cunning
of
poseidon

she
thought
she
would
go

kept

still
in

rose
nor
knew
the
jealous
power
against

sworn
and
more
her
beauty
now
her
foe
since
was
transfigured
by
the
spirit
forlorn
that
writeth
to
the
perfecting
of
grace
immortal
question
in
a
mortal
face
the
vague
desire
whereunto
man
is
born
already
in
good
time
her
sisters
both
whose
honest
charms
were
never
famed
as
hers
with
princes
of
the
isle
had
plighted
troth
and
gone
to
rule
their
foreign
courtiers
but
she
exalted
evermore
beyond
their
loveliness
made
yet
no
lover
fond
and
gain
but
number
to
her
worshippers
to
joy
in
others
joy
had
been
her
lot
and
now
that
that
was
gone
she
wept
to
see
how
her
transcendent
beauty
overshot
the
common
aim
of
all
felicity
for
love
she
sigh
and
had
some
peasant
rude
for
true
love
sake
in
simple
passion
woo
then
psyche
had
not
scorn
his
wife
to
be
for
what
is
beauty
if
it
doth
not
fire
the
loving
answer
of
an
eager
soul
since
is
the
native
food
of
man
desire
and
doth
to
good
our
varying
world
control
which
when
it
was
not
was
for
beauty
sake
desired
and
made
by
love
who
still
doth
make
a
beauteous
path
thereon
to
beauty
goal
should
all
men
by
some
hateful
venom
die
the
pity
were
that
the
unpeopl
sphere
the
sun
would
still
bedeck
the
evening
sky
and
the
unimaginable
hues
appear
with
none
to
mark
the
rose
and
gold
and
green
that
spring
should
walk
the
earth
and
nothing
seen
of
her
fresh
delicacy
year
by
year
and
if
some
beauteous
things
whose
heavenly
worth
and
function
overpass
our
mortal
sense
lie
waste
and
unregarded
on
the
earth
by
reason
of
our
gross
intelligence
these
are
not
vain
because
in
nature
scheme
it
lives
that
we
shall
grow
from
dream
to
dream
in
time
to
gather
an
enchantment
thence
even
as
we
see
the
fairest
works
of
men
awhile
neglected
and
the
makers
die
but
truth
comes
weeping
to
their
graves
and
then
their
fames
victoriously
mounting
high
do
battle
with
the
regnant
names
of
eld
to
win
their
seats
as
when
the
gods
against
their
sires
and
drave
them
from
the
sky
but
to
be
praised
for
beauty
and
denied
the
meed
of
beauty
this
was
yet
unknown
the
best
and
bravest
men
have
ever
vied
to
win
the
fairest
women
for
their
own
thus
psyche
spake
or
reason
in
her
mind
disconsolate
and
with
pined
in
the
deserted
halls
wandering
alone
and
grievèd
grew
the
king
to
see
her
woe
and
blaming
first
the
gods
for
her
disease
he
purposed
to
their
oracle
to
go
to
question
how
he
might
their
wrath
appease
or
if
that
might
not
be
the
worst
to
hear
which
is
the
last
poor
hope
of
them
that
so
he
took
his
ship
upon
the
northern
seas
and
journeying
to
the
shrine
of
delphi
went
the
temple
of
apollo
pythian
where
when
the
god
he
question
if
was
meant
that
psyche
should
be
wed
and
to
what
man
the
tripod
shook
and
the
vaporous
well
the
chanting
pythoness
gave
oracle
and
thus
in
priestly
verse
the
sentence
ran
on
the
topmost
rock
with
funeral
feast
convey
and
leave
the
maid
nor
look
to
find
a
mortal
husband
but
a
savage
beast
the
viperous
scourge
of
gods
and
humankind
who
shames
and
vexes
all
and
as
he
flies
with
sword
and
fire
zeus
trembles
in
the
skies
and
groans
arise
from
souls
to
hell
with
which
reply
the
king
return
full
sad
for
though
he
nothing
more
might
understand
yet
in
the
bitter
bidding
that
he
had
no
man
made
question
of
the
plain
command
that
he
must
sacrifice
the
tender
flower
of
his
own
blood
to
a
demonian
power
upon
the
rocky
mount
with
his
own
hand
some
said
that
she
to
talos
was
devote
the
metal
giant
who
with
stride
cover
the
isle
walking
around
by
rote
thrice
every
day
at
his
appointed
tide
who
shepherded
the
on
the
coast
and
as
he
past
caught
up
and
live
would
roast
pressing
them
to
his
burning
ribs
and
side
whose
head
was
made
of
fine
work
of
silver
pure
his
arms
and
gleaming
chest
thence
of
bronze
far
as
the
fork
of
iron
all
the
rest
one
single
vein
he
had
which
running
down
from
head
to
foot
was
open
in
his
crown
and
closèd
by
a
nail
such
was
this
pest
a
little
while
they
spent
in
sad
delay
then
order
as
the
oracle
had
said
the
cold
feast
and
funereal
display
wherewith
the
fated
bridal
should
be
sped
and
their
black
pageantry
and
vain
despairing
when
psyche
saw
and
for
herself
preparing
the
hopeless
ceremonial
of
the
dead
then
spake
she
to
the
king
and
said
sire
why
wilt
thou
veil
those
venerable
eyes
with
piteous
tears
which
must
of
me
require
more
tears
again
than
for
myself
arise
then
on
the
day
my
beauty
first
its
mortal
place
it
had
been
well
to
have
wept
but
now
the
fault
beyond
our
ruing
lies
to
be
worship
was
my
whole
undoing
so
my
submission
must
the
forfeit
pay
and
welcome
were
the
morning
of
my
wooing
tho
after
it
should
dawn
no
other
day
up
to
the
mountain
for
i
hear
the
voice
of
my
belovèd
on
the
winds
arise
my
love
my
fair
one
and
come
with
such
distemper
speech
that
little
her
mourning
house
she
went
to
choose
with
care
the
raiment
for
her
day
of
wedlock
weird
her
body
as
for
burial
to
prepare
but
laved
with
bridal
water
from
the
stream
where
hera
bathed
for
still
her
fate
supreme
was
doubtful
whether
love
or
death
it
were
love
that
is
made
of
joy
and
death
of
fear
nay
but
not
these
held
psyche
in
suspense
hers
was
the
hope
that
following
by
the
bier
boweth
its
head
beneath
the
dark
immense
her
fear
the
dread
of
life
that
turns
to
hide
its
tragic
tears
what
hour
the
happy
bride
ventures
for
love
her
maiden
innocence
they
set
on
high
upon
the
bridal
wain
her
bed
for
bier
and
yet
no
corpse
thereon
but
like
as
when
unto
a
warrior
slain
and
not
brought
home
the
ceremonies
done
are
empty
for
afar
his
body
brave
lies
lost
deep
buried
by
the
wandering
wave
or
the
foes
his
fury
fell
upon
so
was
her
hearse
and
with
it
went
afore
singing
the
solemn
dirge
that
moves
to
tears
the
singers
and
behind
clad
as
for
war
the
king
uncrown
among
his
mournful
peers
all
their
armour
robed
in
linen
white
and
in
their
left
were
shields
and
in
their
right
torches
they
bore
aloft
instead
of
spears
and
next
the
virgin
tribe
in
white
forth
sail
with
wreaths
of
dittany
and
them
there
went
psyche
all
in
veil
the
white
chapleting
her
hair
and
last
the
common
folk
a
weeping
crowd
far
as
the
with
wailings
loud
follow
the
sad
procession
in
despair
thus
forth
and
up
the
mount
they
went
until
the
funeral
chariot
must
be
left
behind
since
road
was
none
for
steepness
of
the
hill
and
slowly
by
the
narrow
path
they
wind
all
afternoon
their
white
and
scatter
file
toil
on
distinct
ascending
many
a
mile
over
the
long
brown
slopes
and
crags
unkind
but
ere
unto
the
snowy
peak
they
came
of
that
stormshapen
pyramid
so
high
was
evening
and
with
footsteps
slow
and
lame
they
gather
up
their
lagging
company
and
then
her
sire
even
as
apollo
bade
set
on
the
topmost
rock
the
hapless
maid
with
trembling
hands
and
melancholy
cry
and
now
the
sun
was
sunk
only
the
peak
flash
like
a
jewel
in
the
deepening
blue
and
from
the
shade
beneath
none
dared
to
speak
but
all
look
up
where
glorified
anew
psyche
sat
islanded
in
living
day
breathless
they
watcht
her
till
the
last
red
ray
fled
from
her
lifted
arm
that
waved
adieu
there
left
they
her
turning
with
sad
farewells
to
haste
their
homeward
course
as
best
they
might
but
night
was
crowding
up
the
barren
fells
and
hid
full
soon
their
rocky
path
from
sight
and
each
unto
his
stumbling
foot
to
hold
his
torch
was
fain
for
the
moon
was
a
mighty
cloud
from
heaven
to
blot
her
light
and
thro
the
darkness
for
long
while
was
seen
that
armour
train
with
waving
fires
to
thread
downwards
by
pass
defile
and
black
ravine
each
leading
on
the
way
that
he
was
led
slowly
they
gain
the
plain
and
one
by
one
into
the
shadows
of
the
woods
were
gone
or
in
the
clinging
mists
were
quench
and
fled
but
unto
psyche
pondering
her
doom
in
tearful
silence
on
her
stony
chair
a
zephyr
straying
out
of
heaven
wide
room
rush
down
and
gathering
round
her
unaware
fill
with
his
breath
her
vesture
and
her
veil
and
like
a
ship
that
crowding
all
her
sail
leans
to
accompany
the
tranquil
air
she
yielded
and
was
borne
with
swimming
brain
and
airy
joy
along
the
mountain
side
till
hid
from
earth
by
ridging
summits
twain
they
came
upon
a
valley
deep
and
wide
where
the
strong
zephyr
with
his
burden
sank
and
laid
her
down
upon
a
grassy
bank
thyme
and
violets
and
daisies
pied
and
straight
upon
the
touch
of
that
sweet
bed
both
woe
and
wonder
melted
fast
away
and
sleep
with
gentle
stress
her
sense
gathering
as
darkness
doth
on
drooping
day
and
nestling
to
the
ground
she
slowly
drew
her
wearied
limbs
together
and
ere
she
knew
wrapt
in
forgetfulness
and
slumber
lay
may
after
long
sleep
when
psyche
first
awoke
among
the
grasses
the
open
skies
and
heard
the
mounting
larks
whose
carol
spoke
delighted
invitation
to
arise
she
lay
as
one
who
after
many
a
league
hath
slept
off
memory
with
his
long
fatigue
and
waking
knows
not
in
what
place
he
lies
anon
her
quickening
thought
took
up
its
task
and
all
came
back
as
it
had
happ
the
sad
procession
of
the
wedding
mask
the
melancholy
toiling
up
the
height
the
solitary
rock
where
she
was
left
and
thence
in
dark
and
airy
waftage
reft
how
on
the
flowers
she
had
been
disburden
light
thereafter
she
would
rise
and
see
what
place
that
voyage
had
its
haven
in
and
found
she
stood
upon
a
little
hill
whose
base
shelved
off
into
the
valley
all
around
and
all
round
that
the
steep
cliffs
rose
away
save
on
one
side
where
to
the
break
of
day
the
widening
dale
withdrew
in
falling
ground
there
out
from
over
sea
and
scarce
so
high
as
she
the
sun
above
his
watery
blaze
upbroke
the
grey
dome
of
the
morning
sky
and
struck
the
island
with
his
level
rays
sifting
his
gold
thro
lazy
mists
that
still
climb
on
the
shadowy
roots
of
every
hill
and
in
the
breathed
their
silvery
haze
at
hand
on
either
side
there
was
a
wood
and
on
the
upward
lawn
that
sloped
between
not
many
paces
back
a
temple
stood
by
even
steps
ascending
from
the
green
with
shaft
and
pediment
of
marble
made
it
fill
the
passage
of
the
rising
glade
and
there
withstay
the
sun
in
dazzling
sheen
too
fair
for
human
art
so
psyche
thought
it
might
the
fancy
of
some
god
rejoice
like
to
those
halls
which
lame
hephæstos
wrought
original
for
each
god
to
his
choice
in
high
olympus
where
his
matchless
lyre
apollo
wakes
and
the
responsive
choir
of
muses
sing
alternate
with
sweet
voice
wondering
she
drew
anigh
and
in
a
while
went
up
the
steps
as
she
would
entrance
win
and
faced
her
shadow
the
peristyle
upon
the
golden
gate
whose
flanges
twin
as
there
she
stood
irresolute
at
heart
to
try
swung
to
her
of
themselves
apart
whereat
she
past
between
and
stood
within
a
foursquare
court
it
was
with
marble
floor
embay
about
with
pillar
porticoes
that
echo
in
a
somnolent
accord
the
music
of
a
fountain
which
arose
sparkling
in
air
and
splashing
in
its
tank
whose
wanton
babble
as
it
swell
or
sank
gave
idle
voice
to
silence
and
repose
thro
doors
beneath
the
further
colonnade
like
a
deep
cup
reflected
glooms
of
gold
the
inner
rooms
glow
with
inviting
shade
and
standing
in
the
court
she
might
behold
cedar
and
silk
and
silver
and
that
all
the
pargeting
of
ceiling
and
of
wall
was
fresco
with
figures
manifold
then
making
bold
to
go
within
she
heard
murmur
of
gentle
welcome
in
her
ear
and
seeing
none
that
coud
have
spoken
word
she
waited
when
again
lady
draw
near
enter
was
cried
and
now
more
voices
came
from
all
the
air
around
calling
her
name
and
bidding
her
rejoice
and
have
no
fear
and
one
if
she
would
rest
would
show
her
bed
pillow
for
sleep
with
fragrant
linen
fine
one
were
she
hungry
had
a
table
spread
like
as
the
high
gods
have
it
when
they
dine
or
would
she
bathe
were
those
would
heat
the
bath
the
joyous
cries
contending
in
her
path
psyche
they
said
what
wilt
thou
all
is
thine
then
psyche
would
have
thank
their
service
true
but
that
she
fear
her
echoing
words
might
scare
those
sightless
tongues
and
well
by
dream
she
knew
the
voices
of
the
messengers
of
prayer
which
fly
upon
the
gods
commandment
when
they
answer
the
supreme
desires
of
men
or
for
a
while
in
pity
hush
their
care
was
fancy
consummation
and
because
she
would
do
joy
no
curious
despite
she
made
no
wonder
how
the
wonder
was
only
concern
to
take
her
full
delight
so
to
the
bath
what
luxury
could
be
better
enhanced
by
eyeless
ministry
she
follows
with
the
voices
that
invite
there
being
deliciously
refresht
from
soil
of
earth
made
pure
by
water
fire
and
air
they
clad
her
in
soft
robes
of
asian
toil
scented
that
in
her
queenly
wardrobe
were
and
led
her
forth
to
dine
and
all
around
sang
as
they
served
the
while
a
choral
sound
of
strings
unseen
and
reeds
the
burden
bare
p
athetic
strains
and
passionate
they
wove
u
rgent
in
ecstasies
of
heavenly
sense
r
esponsive
rivalries
that
while
they
strove
c
ombined
in
full
harmonious
suspense
e
ntrancing
wild
desire
then
fell
at
last
l
ull
in
soft
closes
and
with
gay
contrast
l
aunch
forth
their
fresh
unwearied
excellence
now
psyche
when
her
twofold
feast
was
would
feed
her
eye
and
choosing
for
her
guide
a
singer
bade
her
come
explore
the
wondrous
house
until
on
every
side
as
surfeited
with
beauty
and
seeing
nought
but
what
was
rich
and
fair
beyond
her
thought
and
all
her
own
thus
to
the
voice
she
cried
i
indeed
a
goddess
or
is
this
but
to
be
dead
and
through
the
gates
of
death
passing
unwittingly
doth
man
not
miss
body
nor
memory
nor
living
breath
nor
by
demerits
of
his
deeds
is
cast
but
paid
with
the
desire
he
holdeth
fast
is
holp
with
all
his
heart
imagineth
but
her
for
all
reply
the
wandering
tongue
call
to
the
chamber
where
her
bed
was
laid
with
flower
broideries
of
linen
hung
and
round
the
walls
in
painting
were
love
victories
over
the
gods
renown
ares
and
aphrodite
here
lay
bound
in
the
fine
net
that
dark
hephæstus
made
here
zeus
in
likeness
of
a
tawny
bull
stoop
on
the
cretan
shore
his
mighty
knee
while
off
his
back
europa
beautiful
stept
pale
against
the
blue
carpathian
sea
and
here
apollo
as
he
caught
amazed
daphne
for
lo
her
hands
shot
forth
upraised
in
leaves
her
feet
were
rooted
like
a
tree
here
dionysos
springing
from
his
car
at
sight
of
ariadne
here
uplept
adonis
to
the
chase
breaking
the
bar
of
aphrodite
arm
for
love
who
wept
he
spear
in
hand
with
leashèd
dogs
at
strain
a
marvellous
work
but
psyche
soon
grown
fain
of
rest
betook
her
to
her
bed
and
slept
nor
long
had
slept
when
at
a
sudden
stir
she
woke
and
one
that
thro
the
dark
made
way
drew
near
and
stood
beside
and
over
her
the
curtain
rustl
trembling
now
she
lay
fainting
with
terror
till
upon
her
face
a
kiss
and
with
two
gentle
arms
embrace
a
voice
that
call
her
name
in
loving
play
though
for
the
darkness
she
coud
nothing
see
she
wish
not
then
for
what
the
night
denied
this
was
the
lover
she
had
lack
and
she
loving
his
loving
was
his
willing
bride
she
slept
again
awoke
at
break
of
morn
upon
her
love
to
look
when
lo
his
empty
place
lay
by
her
side
so
all
that
day
she
spent
in
company
of
the
soft
voices
and
of
right
they
said
art
thou
our
lady
now
be
happily
thy
bridal
morrow
by
thy
servants
sped
but
she
but
long
for
night
if
that
might
bring
her
lover
back
and
he
on
secret
wing
came
with
the
dark
and
in
the
darkness
fled
and
this
was
all
her
life
for
every
night
he
came
and
though
his
name
she
never
learn
nor
was
his
image
yielded
to
her
sight
at
morn
or
eve
she
neither
look
nor
beyond
her
happiness
and
custom
brought
an
ease
to
pleasure
nor
would
psyche
thought
have
ever
to
her
earthly
home
return
but
that
one
night
he
said
my
soul
sad
danger
threatens
us
thy
sisters
twain
come
to
the
mountain
top
whence
i
thee
stole
and
thou
wilt
hear
their
voices
thence
complain
answer
them
not
for
it
must
end
our
love
if
they
should
hear
or
spy
thee
from
above
and
psyche
said
cry
shall
be
in
vain
but
being
again
alone
she
thought
was
hard
on
her
own
blood
and
blamed
her
joy
as
thief
of
theirs
her
comfort
which
their
comfort
barr
when
she
their
care
might
be
their
care
relief
all
day
she
brooded
on
her
father
woe
and
when
at
night
her
lover
kisst
her
lo
her
tender
face
was
wet
with
tears
of
grief
then
question
why
she
wept
she
all
confest
and
begg
of
him
she
might
but
once
go
nigh
to
set
her
sire
and
sisters
fears
at
rest
till
he
for
pity
coud
not
but
comply
if
they
should
ask
thee
of
thy
love
discover
nothing
to
their
ears
above
and
psyche
said
vain
shall
be
their
cry
and
yet
with
day
no
sooner
was
alone
than
she
for
loneliness
her
promise
rued
that
having
so
much
pleasure
for
her
own
was
all
unshared
and
spent
in
solitude
and
when
at
night
her
love
flew
to
his
place
more
than
afore
she
shamed
his
fond
embrace
and
piteously
with
tears
her
plaint
renew
the
more
he
now
denied
the
more
she
wept
nor
would
in
anywise
be
comforted
unless
her
sisters
on
the
zephyr
swept
should
in
those
halls
be
one
day
bathed
and
fed
and
see
themselves
the
palace
where
she
reign
and
he
by
force
of
tears
at
last
constrain
granted
her
wish
unwillingly
and
said
to
our
peril
hast
thou
won
thy
will
thy
sisters
love
seeing
thee
honour
so
will
sour
to
envy
and
with
jealous
skill
will
pry
to
learn
the
thing
that
none
may
know
answer
not
nor
inquire
for
know
that
i
the
day
thou
seest
my
face
far
hence
shall
fly
and
thou
anew
to
bitterest
fate
must
go
but
psyche
said
love
is
more
than
life
to
have
thee
leaveth
nothing
to
be
won
for
should
the
noonday
prove
me
to
be
wife
even
of
the
beauteous
eros
who
is
son
of
cypris
i
coud
never
love
thee
more
whereat
he
fondly
kisst
her
and
and
peace
was
them
till
the
night
was
done
second
quarter
summer
psyche
sisters
snaring
her
to
destruction
are
themselves
destroyed
june
and
truly
need
there
was
to
the
old
king
for
consolation
since
the
mournful
day
of
psyche
fate
he
took
no
comforting
but
only
for
a
speedy
death
would
pray
and
on
his
head
his
hair
grew
such
on
life
topmost
bough
is
sorrow
blight
when
the
stout
heart
is
cankering
to
decay
which
when
his
daughters
learnt
they
both
were
quick
comfort
and
solace
to
their
sire
to
lend
but
as
not
seldom
they
who
nurse
the
sick
will
take
the
malady
from
them
they
tend
so
happ
it
now
for
they
who
fail
to
cheer
grew
sad
themselves
and
in
that
palace
drear
increased
the
evil
that
they
came
to
mend
and
them
the
unhappy
father
sent
to
seek
where
psyche
had
been
left
if
they
might
find
what
monster
held
her
on
the
savage
peak
or
if
she
there
had
died
of
hunger
pined
and
by
wild
eagles
stript
her
scatter
bones
might
still
be
gather
from
the
barren
stones
or
if
her
fate
had
left
no
trace
behind
so
just
upon
this
time
her
sisters
both
climb
on
the
cliff
that
hung
psyche
vale
and
finding
there
no
sign
to
leave
were
loth
ere
well
assured
she
lurk
not
within
hail
so
calling
loud
her
name
they
cried
o
psyche
and
when
none
replied
they
sank
upon
the
rocks
to
weep
and
wail
but
psyche
heard
their
voices
where
she
sat
and
summoning
the
zephyr
bade
him
fleet
those
mourners
down
unto
the
grassy
plat
of
her
garden
where
she
had
her
seat
then
from
the
dizzy
steep
the
wondering
pair
came
swiftly
sinking
on
his
buoyant
air
and
stood
upon
the
terrace
at
her
feet
upsprang
she
then
and
kiss
them
and
embraced
and
said
here
am
i
i
whom
ye
mourn
i
am
not
dead
nor
tortured
nor
disgraced
but
blest
above
all
days
since
i
was
born
wherefore
be
glad
enter
my
home
and
see
how
little
cause
has
been
to
grieve
for
me
and
my
desertion
on
the
rocks
forlorn
so
entering
by
the
golden
gate
or
the
marvel
of
their
hither
flight
had
waned
fresh
wonder
took
them
now
for
everywhere
their
eyes
that
lit
on
beauty
were
enchain
and
psyche
airy
service
as
she
bade
perform
its
magic
office
and
the
riches
of
the
palace
where
she
reign
and
through
the
perfumed
chambers
they
were
led
and
bathed
therein
and
after
set
to
sup
were
upon
dreamlike
delicacies
fed
and
wine
more
precious
than
its
golden
cup
till
seeing
nothing
lack
and
naught
was
theirs
their
happiness
fell
from
them
unawares
and
bitter
envy
in
their
hearts
sprang
up
at
last
one
said
since
not
alone
thou
livest
here
in
joy
as
well
we
wot
who
is
the
man
who
should
these
wonders
own
or
god
i
say
and
still
appeareth
not
what
is
his
name
what
rank
and
guise
hath
he
whom
winds
and
spirits
serve
who
honoureth
thee
above
all
others
in
thy
blissful
lot
but
psyche
when
that
wistful
speech
she
heard
was
ware
of
all
her
spouse
had
warn
her
of
and
uttering
a
disingenuous
word
said
youth
yet
unbearded
is
my
love
he
goeth
hunting
on
the
plains
and
with
his
dogs
hath
wander
far
away
and
not
till
eve
can
he
return
above
then
fearing
to
be
nearer
plied
she
rose
and
brought
her
richest
jewels
one
by
one
bidding
them
choose
and
take
they
chose
and
beckoning
the
zephyr
spake
anon
that
he
should
waft
her
sisters
to
the
peak
the
which
he
did
and
ere
they
more
coud
speak
they
rose
on
high
and
in
the
wind
were
gone
nor
till
again
they
came
upon
the
road
which
from
the
mountain
shoulder
the
plain
led
to
the
city
of
their
sire
abode
found
they
their
tongues
though
full
of
high
disdain
their
hearts
were
but
kept
silence
till
the
strength
of
pride
and
envious
hatred
burst
at
length
in
voice
and
thus
the
elder
gan
complain
and
unjust
fortune
that
of
three
sisters
whose
being
from
one
fountain
well
exalts
the
last
so
high
from
her
degree
and
leaves
the
first
to
be
so
far
excel
my
husband
is
a
poor
and
niggard
churl
to
him
he
be
that
loves
the
girl
oh
in
what
godlike
state
her
house
is
held
said
the
other
a
gouty
loon
am
i
not
wedded
lo
thy
hurt
is
mine
but
never
call
me
woman
more
if
soon
i
can
not
lure
her
from
her
height
divine
nay
she
shall
need
her
cunning
wit
to
save
the
wealth
of
which
so
grudgingly
she
gave
wherefore
thy
hand
and
heart
with
me
combine
but
received
us
out
of
pride
to
show
her
state
well
deeming
that
her
happiness
was
little
worth
while
there
was
none
to
know
so
is
our
lot
uninjured
if
none
guess
reveal
we
nothing
therefore
but
the
while
together
scheme
this
wanton
to
beguile
and
bring
her
boasting
godhead
to
distress
so
fresh
disordering
their
dress
and
hair
with
loud
lament
they
to
their
sire
return
telling
they
found
not
psyche
anywhere
and
of
her
sure
mischance
could
nothing
learn
and
with
that
lie
the
wounded
man
they
slew
hiding
the
saving
truth
which
well
they
knew
nor
did
his
piteous
grief
their
heart
concern
meanwhile
her
unknown
lover
did
not
cease
to
warn
poor
psyche
how
her
sisters
to
undermine
her
love
and
joy
and
peace
and
urged
how
well
she
might
their
wiles
withstand
by
keeping
them
from
her
delight
aloof
for
better
is
security
than
proof
and
malice
held
afar
than
near
at
hand
dearest
wife
he
said
is
not
long
ere
one
will
come
to
share
thy
secrecy
and
be
thy
babe
and
mine
let
nothing
wrong
the
happy
months
of
thy
maternity
if
thou
keep
trust
then
shalt
thou
see
thy
child
a
god
but
if
to
pry
thou
be
beguiled
the
lot
of
both
is
death
and
misery
then
psyche
simple
heart
was
fill
with
joy
and
counting
to
herself
the
months
and
days
look
for
the
time
when
she
should
bear
a
boy
to
be
her
growing
stay
and
godlike
praise
and
be
sure
she
said
sure
my
pride
having
so
rich
a
promise
can
not
slide
even
if
my
love
coud
fail
which
thee
obeys
and
so
most
happily
her
life
went
by
in
thoughts
of
love
dear
to
her
new
estate
until
at
length
the
evil
day
drew
nigh
when
now
her
sisters
joined
in
jealous
hate
set
forth
again
and
plotted
by
the
way
how
they
might
best
allure
her
to
betray
her
secret
with
what
he
their
angle
bait
that
night
her
husband
spake
to
her
and
said
thy
sisters
come
and
when
they
climb
the
peak
they
will
not
tarry
to
be
sped
down
by
the
zephyr
as
that
other
time
but
winging
to
the
wind
will
cast
themselves
out
in
the
air
and
on
the
rocky
shelves
be
dasht
and
pay
the
penalty
of
crime
let
it
be
and
so
shall
we
be
saved
which
meditated
vengeance
of
his
fear
when
psyche
heard
now
for
their
life
she
craved
whose
mere
distress
erewhile
had
toucht
her
near
around
her
lover
neck
her
arms
she
threw
and
pleaded
for
them
by
her
faith
so
true
although
they
went
on
doom
in
judgment
clear
in
terror
of
bloodguiltiness
she
now
forgot
all
other
danger
she
adjured
or
using
playfulness
deep
sobs
would
plow
her
soft
entreaties
not
to
be
endured
till
he
at
last
was
fain
once
more
to
grant
the
service
of
the
zephyr
to
enchant
that
wicked
couple
from
their
fate
assured
so
ere
was
noon
were
noises
at
the
door
of
knocking
loud
and
voices
high
in
glee
such
as
within
that
vale
never
before
had
been
and
now
seem
most
unmeet
to
be
and
psyche
blush
though
being
alone
and
rose
to
meet
her
sisters
and
herself
unclose
the
gate
that
made
them
of
her
palace
free
fondly
she
kiss
them
and
with
kindly
cheer
sought
to
amuse
and
they
with
outward
smile
their
hate
and
called
her
sweet
and
dear
finding
affection
easy
to
beguile
and
all
was
smooth
until
at
last
one
said
us
i
pray
to
whom
is
thou
art
wed
gods
or
men
what
is
his
rank
and
style
canst
not
think
to
hide
the
truth
from
us
who
knew
thy
peevish
sorrows
when
a
maid
and
see
thee
now
so
glad
and
rapturous
as
changed
from
what
thou
wert
as
light
from
shade
thy
jewels
too
the
palace
of
a
king
nor
least
the
serviceable
spiriting
by
everything
thy
secret
is
betray
yet
thou
talkest
of
thy
wondrous
man
no
more
than
if
his
face
thou
didst
not
know
at
which
incontinently
she
began
forgetful
of
her
word
a
month
ago
answering
merchant
rich
of
middle
age
my
husband
is
and
his
features
sage
his
temples
are
already
touch
with
snow
his
wish
since
hither
ye
were
brought
best
depart
then
her
accustom
spell
sped
them
upon
the
summit
quick
as
thought
and
being
alone
her
doing
pleased
her
well
so
was
she
vext
to
find
her
love
at
night
more
sad
than
ever
of
her
sisters
spite
speaking
as
one
that
coud
the
end
foretell
ere
long
said
he
will
spy
again
let
them
be
dash
upon
the
rocks
and
die
is
they
must
come
to
death
or
thou
to
pain
to
separation
psyche
thou
and
i
nay
and
our
babe
to
ill
i
therefore
crave
thou
wilt
not
even
once
more
these
vipers
save
nor
to
thy
love
his
only
boon
deny
but
psyche
would
not
think
her
sisters
crime
so
gross
and
strange
nor
coud
her
danger
see
since
so
easy
if
at
any
time
they
show
the
venom
of
their
hearts
that
she
should
fan
them
off
upon
the
willing
gust
so
she
refused
and
claiming
truer
trust
would
in
no
wise
unto
their
death
agree
july
think
you
sister
thus
one
envious
fiend
to
other
spake
upon
their
homeward
route
of
the
story
that
our
wit
hath
of
this
mysterious
lover
who
can
shoot
in
thirty
days
from
beardless
youth
to
prime
with
wisdom
in
his
face
before
his
time
and
snowy
locks
upon
his
head
to
boot
said
the
other
she
lied
not
well
and
thence
i
gather
knows
no
more
than
we
for
surely
is
a
spirit
insensible
to
whom
she
is
wedded
one
she
can
not
see
is
that
i
fear
for
if
is
so
her
child
will
be
a
god
and
she
a
goddess
styled
which
though
i
die
to
let
it
shall
not
be
we
thus
no
longer
come
consult
what
may
be
done
and
home
they
came
at
night
yet
not
to
rest
but
of
their
plots
occult
sat
whispering
on
their
beds
and
ere
was
light
resolving
on
the
deed
coud
not
defer
but
roused
the
sleeping
house
with
sudden
stir
and
sallied
forth
alone
to
work
their
spite
and
with
the
noon
were
climb
upon
the
peak
and
swam
down
on
the
zephyr
as
before
but
now
with
piercing
cry
and
doleful
shriek
they
force
their
entrance
through
the
golden
door
feigning
the
urgency
of
bitter
truth
such
as
deforms
a
friendly
face
with
ruth
when
kindness
may
not
hide
ill
tidings
more
then
psyche
when
she
heard
their
wailful
din
and
saw
their
countenances
wan
and
worn
with
travel
vigil
and
disfiguring
sin
their
hair
dishevel
and
their
habits
torn
for
trembling
scarce
coud
ask
what
ill
had
hapt
and
they
alert
with
joy
to
see
her
trapt
launch
forth
amain
and
on
their
drift
were
borne
psyche
happiest
certainly
and
blest
up
to
this
hour
they
said
surely
wert
being
of
thy
fearful
peril
unpossest
which
now
we
would
not
tell
but
to
avert
but
we
in
solemn
truth
thy
spouse
have
found
to
be
the
dragon
of
this
mountain
ground
who
holds
thee
here
to
work
thy
shame
and
hurt
yesternight
we
rode
upon
the
wind
he
issued
to
pursue
us
from
the
wood
we
saw
his
back
that
through
the
finn
his
fiery
eyes
glared
from
their
wrinkl
hood
lo
now
betimes
the
oracle
which
said
how
to
the
savage
beast
thou
shouldst
be
wed
is
plainly
for
thy
safety
understood
time
hath
he
been
known
to
all
that
dwell
upon
the
plain
but
now
his
secret
lair
have
we
discover
which
none
else
coud
tell
though
many
women
fallen
in
his
snare
hath
he
enchanted
who
tradition
saith
taste
love
awhile
ere
to
their
cruel
death
they
pass
in
turn
upon
the
summits
bare
renounce
the
spells
of
this
accursed
vale
we
come
to
save
thee
but
we
dare
not
stay
among
these
sightless
spirits
our
senses
quail
fly
with
us
fly
then
psyche
for
her
soul
was
soft
and
simple
lost
her
and
thinking
only
of
the
horrid
tale
sisters
said
she
and
her
sobbing
speech
was
broken
by
her
terror
is
true
that
much
hath
hapt
to
stablish
what
ye
teach
for
hath
it
been
granted
me
to
view
my
husband
and
for
aught
i
know
he
may
be
even
that
cruel
dragon
which
ye
say
peer
at
you
from
the
forest
to
pursue
tis
sure
that
scarcely
can
i
win
his
grace
to
see
you
here
and
still
he
mischief
vows
if
ever
i
should
ask
to
see
his
face
which
coming
in
the
dark
he
allows
therefore
if
ye
can
help
of
pity
show
since
doubt
i
must
how
i
may
come
to
know
what
kind
of
spirit
it
is
that
is
my
spouse
then
to
her
cue
the
younger
was
afore
thou
a
razor
cried
she
thy
bed
and
have
a
lamp
prepared
but
whelm
some
cover
that
no
light
be
from
it
shed
and
when
securely
in
first
sleep
he
lies
look
on
him
well
and
ere
he
can
arise
gashing
his
throat
cut
off
his
hideous
head
which
both
persuading
off
they
flew
content
divining
that
she
was
forbid
was
by
her
lover
for
her
safety
meant
which
only
coud
be
sure
while
he
was
hid
but
psyche
to
that
miserable
deed
being
now
already
in
her
mind
agreed
wander
alone
and
knew
not
what
she
did
now
she
would
trust
her
lover
now
in
turn
made
question
of
his
bidding
as
unjust
but
thirsting
curiosity
to
learn
his
secret
overcame
her
simple
trust
her
spoken
troth
her
fear
and
she
prepared
as
now
the
hour
drew
near
the
mean
contrivances
nor
felt
disgust
she
set
the
lamp
beneath
a
chair
and
cloked
thickly
its
rebel
lustre
from
the
eye
and
laid
the
knife
to
mortal
keenness
stroked
within
her
reach
where
she
was
wont
to
lie
and
took
her
place
full
early
but
her
heart
beat
fast
and
stay
her
breath
with
sudden
start
feeling
her
lover
arm
laid
fond
thereby
but
when
at
last
he
slept
then
she
arose
all
faint
and
tremulous
and
though
it
be
that
wrong
betrayeth
innocence
with
shews
of
novelty
its
guilt
from
shame
to
free
yet
was
for
shame
her
hand
so
strangely
shook
that
held
the
steel
and
from
the
cloke
that
took
the
lamp
and
raised
it
the
bed
to
see
she
had
some
fear
she
might
not
well
discern
by
that
small
flame
a
monster
in
the
gloom
when
lo
the
air
about
her
seem
to
burn
and
bright
celestial
radiance
fill
the
room
too
plainly
o
she
saw
o
fair
to
see
eros
was
eros
self
her
lover
he
the
god
of
love
reveal
in
deathless
bloom
her
fainting
strength
forsook
her
on
her
knees
down
by
the
bed
she
sank
the
shameless
knife
fell
flashing
and
her
heart
took
thought
to
seize
its
desperate
haft
and
end
her
wicked
life
yet
coud
she
not
her
loving
eyes
withdraw
from
her
fair
sleeping
lover
whom
she
saw
only
to
know
she
was
no
more
his
wife
o
treasure
of
all
treasures
late
her
own
o
loss
above
all
losses
lost
for
aye
since
there
was
no
repentance
coud
atone
for
her
dishonour
nor
her
fate
withstay
but
yet
was
joy
to
have
her
love
in
sight
and
to
the
rapture
yielding
while
she
might
she
gazed
upon
his
body
where
he
lay
above
all
mortal
beauty
as
was
hers
she
saw
a
rival
but
if
passion
heart
be
rightly
read
by
subtle
questioners
it
owns
a
wanton
and
a
gentler
part
and
psyche
wonder
noting
every
sign
by
which
the
immortal
god
her
spouse
divine
betray
the
image
of
our
earthly
art
his
thickly
curling
hair
his
ruddy
cheeks
and
pouting
lips
his
soft
and
dimpl
chin
the
full
and
cushion
eye
that
idly
speaks
of
and
vanity
within
the
forward
froward
ear
and
smooth
to
touch
his
body
sleek
but
rounded
overmuch
for
dignity
of
mind
and
pride
akin
she
noted
that
the
small
irradiant
wings
that
from
his
shoulders
lay
along
at
rest
were
yet
disturb
with
airy
quiverings
as
if
some
wakeful
spirit
his
blood
possest
she
feared
he
was
awaking
but
they
kept
their
sweet
commotion
still
and
still
he
slept
and
still
she
gazed
with
zest
and
now
the
colour
of
her
pride
and
joy
outflush
the
hue
of
eros
she
so
cold
to
have
fired
the
passion
of
the
heartless
boy
whom
none
in
heaven
or
earth
were
found
to
hold
psyche
the
earthborn
to
be
prized
above
the
heavenly
graces
by
the
god
of
love
and
worshipt
by
his
wantonness
untold
nay
for
that
very
thing
she
loved
him
more
more
than
herself
her
sweet
self
complement
until
the
sight
of
him
again
upbore
her
courage
and
renew
her
vigour
spent
and
looking
now
around
she
first
espied
where
at
the
bed
foot
cast
in
haste
aside
lay
his
full
quiver
and
his
bow
unbent
one
of
those
darts
of
which
she
had
heard
so
oft
she
took
to
try
if
was
so
very
keen
and
held
its
point
against
her
finger
soft
so
gently
that
to
touch
it
scarce
was
seen
yet
was
she
sharply
prickt
and
felt
the
fire
run
through
her
veins
and
now
a
strange
desire
troubl
her
heart
which
before
had
been
straight
sprang
she
to
her
lover
on
the
bed
and
kisst
his
cheek
and
was
not
satisfied
when
o
the
lamp
held
one
drop
of
burning
oil
spill
from
its
side
on
eros
naked
shoulder
as
he
slept
who
waken
by
the
sudden
smart
uplept
upon
the
floor
and
all
the
mischief
eyed
with
nervous
speed
he
seized
his
bow
and
past
out
of
the
guilty
chamber
at
a
bound
but
psyche
following
his
flight
as
fast
caught
him
and
crying
threw
her
arms
around
till
coming
to
the
court
he
rose
in
air
and
she
close
clinging
in
her
last
despair
was
dragg
and
then
lost
hold
and
fell
to
ground
wailing
she
fell
but
he
upon
the
roof
staying
his
feet
awhile
his
flight
delay
and
turning
to
her
as
he
stood
aloof
beside
a
cypress
whose
profoundest
shade
drank
the
reflections
of
the
dreamy
night
in
its
stiff
pinnacle
the
nimble
light
of
million
stars
upon
his
body
play
psyche
thus
he
spake
and
she
upraised
her
piteous
eyes
and
hands
psyche
for
thy
sake
i
dared
to
break
my
mother
stern
commands
and
gave
thee
godlike
marriage
in
the
place
of
vilest
shame
and
not
to
hurt
thy
grace
spared
thee
my
arrows
which
no
heart
withstands
thou
for
doubt
i
was
some
evil
beast
hast
mock
the
warnings
of
my
love
to
spy
upon
my
secret
which
concern
thee
least
seeing
that
thy
joy
was
never
touch
thereby
by
faithless
prying
thou
hast
work
thy
fall
and
even
as
i
foretold
thee
losest
all
for
looking
on
thy
happiness
too
nigh
loss
may
be
thine
ample
punishment
but
to
those
fiends
by
whom
thou
wert
misled
go
tell
each
one
in
turn
that
i
have
sent
this
message
that
i
love
her
in
thy
stead
and
bid
them
by
their
love
haste
hither
soon
whereat
he
fled
and
psyche
in
a
swoon
fell
back
upon
the
marble
floor
as
dead
august
when
from
the
lowest
ebbing
of
her
blood
the
fluttering
pulses
thrill
and
swell
again
her
stricken
heart
recovering
force
to
flood
with
life
the
sunken
conduits
of
her
brain
then
psyche
where
she
had
fallen
numb
and
cold
arose
but
scarce
her
quaking
sense
control
seeing
the
couch
where
she
that
night
had
lain
the
level
sunbeams
search
the
grassy
ground
for
diamond
dewdrops
ah
was
this
the
place
where
was
the
court
her
home
she
look
around
and
question
with
her
memory
for
a
space
there
was
the
cypress
there
the
wood
that
wall
the
spot
was
here
her
palace
stood
as
surely
as
was
vanish
without
trace
was
all
a
dream
to
think
that
all
was
dreamt
were
now
the
happier
thought
but
arguing
that
dream
it
was
she
fell
from
her
attempt
feeling
the
wifely
burden
that
she
bore
nay
true
was
true
she
had
had
all
and
lost
the
joy
the
reckless
wrong
the
heavy
cost
were
hers
the
dead
end
now
and
woe
in
store
what
to
be
done
fainting
and
shelterless
upon
the
mountain
it
were
death
to
bide
and
harbour
knew
she
none
where
her
distress
might
comfort
find
or
love
dishonour
hide
nor
felt
she
any
dread
like
that
of
home
yet
forth
she
must
albeit
to
rove
and
roam
an
outcast
the
country
far
and
wide
anon
she
marvel
noting
from
the
vale
a
path
lead
downward
to
the
plain
below
crossing
the
very
site
whereon
the
pale
of
all
her
joy
had
stood
few
hours
ago
a
run
of
mountain
beasts
that
keep
their
track
through
generations
and
for
ages
back
had
trod
the
footing
to
and
fro
that
would
she
try
so
forth
she
took
her
way
turning
her
face
from
the
dishonour
dell
adown
the
broadening
eastward
lawns
which
lay
in
gentle
slant
till
suddenly
they
fell
in
sheer
cliff
whence
the
path
that
went
around
clomb
by
the
bluffs
or
it
downward
wound
beneath
that
precipice
impassable
there
once
she
turn
and
gazing
up
the
slope
she
bid
the
scene
of
all
her
joy
adieu
and
farewell
she
cried
to
hope
since
there
is
none
will
rescue
me
anew
who
have
kill
god
perfection
with
a
doubt
which
said
she
took
the
path
that
led
about
and
hid
the
upland
pleasance
from
her
view
but
soon
it
left
her
entering
the
shade
of
cedar
old
and
russeted
tall
pine
whose
mighty
tops
seen
from
the
thorny
glade
belted
the
hills
about
and
now
no
sign
had
she
to
guide
her
save
the
slow
descent
but
swiftly
the
springy
floor
she
went
and
drew
the
odorous
air
like
draughts
of
wine
then
next
she
past
a
forest
thick
and
dark
with
heavy
ilexes
and
platanes
high
and
came
to
long
lush
grass
and
now
coud
mark
by
many
a
token
that
the
plain
was
nigh
when
lo
a
river
to
whose
brink
at
last
being
come
upon
the
bank
her
limbs
she
cast
and
through
her
sad
tears
watch
the
stream
go
by
and
now
the
thought
came
her
that
in
death
there
was
a
cure
for
sorrow
that
before
her
eyes
ran
lethe
she
might
take
one
breath
of
water
and
be
freed
for
evermore
leaning
to
look
into
her
tomb
thereon
she
saw
the
horror
of
her
image
wan
and
up
she
rose
at
height
to
leap
from
shore
when
suddenly
a
mighty
voice
that
fell
with
fury
on
her
ears
their
sense
to
scare
that
bounding
from
the
tree
trunks
like
the
yell
of
hundred
brazen
trumpets
cried
forbear
fond
maid
that
froward
step
to
take
for
life
can
cure
the
ills
that
love
may
make
but
for
the
harm
of
death
is
no
repair
then
looking
up
she
saw
an
uncouth
form
perch
on
the
further
bank
whose
parted
lips
volley
their
friendly
warning
in
a
storm
a
man
he
might
have
been
but
for
the
tips
of
horns
appearing
from
his
shaggy
head
for
his
matted
beard
his
face
was
red
and
all
his
shape
was
manlike
to
the
hips
in
forehead
low
keen
eye
and
nostril
flat
he
bore
the
human
grace
in
mean
degree
but
set
beneath
his
body
squat
and
fat
legs
like
a
goat
and
from
the
hairy
knee
the
shank
fell
spare
and
though
crosswise
he
put
his
limbs
in
easeful
posture
for
the
foot
the
beast
divided
hoof
was
plain
to
see
him
then
she
knew
the
mighty
choric
god
the
great
and
pan
whom
zeus
had
laught
to
see
when
first
he
trod
olympus
neither
god
nor
beast
nor
man
who
every
rocky
peak
and
snowy
crest
of
the
aspran
mountains
for
his
own
possest
and
all
their
alps
with
bacchic
rout
whom
when
his
pipe
he
plays
on
loud
and
sweet
and
the
fitted
reeds
his
moist
lip
flees
around
in
measured
step
with
nimble
feet
dance
and
hamadryades
and
all
the
woodland
airy
folk
who
shun
man
presence
to
his
frolic
pastime
run
from
their
perennial
wells
and
sacred
trees
now
on
his
knee
his
pipe
laid
by
he
spoke
with
flippant
tongue
wounding
unwittingly
the
heart
he
sought
to
cheer
with
jest
and
joke
what
hast
thou
to
do
with
misery
he
said
hast
such
beauty
as
might
gain
the
love
of
eros
cast
away
thy
pain
and
give
thy
soul
to
mirth
and
jollity
mortal
life
is
but
a
brittle
vase
but
as
thee
list
with
wine
or
tears
to
fill
for
all
the
drops
therein
are
ohs
and
ahs
of
joy
or
grief
according
to
thy
will
and
wouldst
thou
learn
of
me
my
merry
way
i
teach
thee
change
thy
lover
every
day
and
prize
the
cup
that
thou
wert
fain
to
spill
if
thou
plunge
thou
shalt
not
drown
nor
sink
for
i
will
to
thee
the
stream
afloat
and
bear
thee
safe
and
o
i
know
a
drink
for

that
makes
sweet
music
in

with
me
my
love
i

thy
chance

can
laugh
and
quaff
and
pipe
and
dance
swim
like
a
fish
and
caper
like
a
goat
speaking
his
brute
divinity
explored
the
secret
of
her
silence
and
old
pan
grew
kind
and
told
her
of
a
shallow
ford
where
lower
down
the
stream
pebbles
ran
and
one
might
pass
at
ease
with
ankles
dry
whither
she
went
and
crossing
thereby
her
lonely
wanderings
through
the
isle
began
but
none
coud
tell
no
nor
herself
had
told
where
food
she
found
or
shelter
through
the
land
by
day
or
night
until
by
fate
she
came
by
steep
ways
to
the
southern
strand
where
sacred
to
the
twins
and
britomart
pent
in
its
rocky
theatre
apart
a
little
town
stood
on
the
level
sand
was
where
her
younger
sister
husband
reign
and
psyche
to
the
palace
gate
drew
near
helplessly
still
by
eros
hest
constrain
and
knocking
begg
to
see
her
sister
dear
but
when
in
state
stepp
down
that
haughty
queen
and
saw
the
wan
face
spent
with
tears
and
teen
she
smiled
and
said
what
dost
thou
here
then
psyche
told
how
having
well
their
means
and
done
their
bidding
not
amiss
looking
on
him
her
hand
would
have
destroy
was
eros
whom
in
love
leaning
to
kiss
even
as
she
kisst
a
drop
of
burning
oil
from
the
lamp
had
served
her
scheme
to
foil
discovering
her
in
vision
of
her
bliss
wherewith
the
god
stung
like
a
startled
bird
arose
in
air
and
she
fell
back
in
swoon
ere
he
parted
said
she
on
thee
the
irrecoverable
boon
by
prying
lost
to
me
he
said
sister
that
i
love
her
in
thy
stead
and
bid
her
by
her
love
haste
hither
which
when
that
heart
of
malice
heard
it
took
the
jealous
fancy
of
her
silly
lust
and
pitilessly
with
triumphant
look
she
drank
the
flattery
and
gave
full
trust
and
leaving
psyche
ere
she
more
coud
tell
ran
off
to
bid
her
spouse
for
aye
farewell
and
in
his
ear
this
ready
lie
she
thrust
dearest
sister
psyche
she
whose
fate
we
mourn
hath
reappear
alive
and
hale
but
brings
sad
news
my
father
dies
full
late
these
tidings
come
but
love
may
yet
avail
let
me
be
gone
and
stealing
blind
consent
forth
on
that
road
she
went
and
climb
upon
the
peak
above
the
dale
there
on
the
topmost
rock
where
psyche
first
had
by
her
weeping
sire
been
left
to
die
she
stood
a
moment
in
her
hope
accurst
being
happy
and
the
cliffs
took
up
her
cry
with
chuckling
mockery
from
her
tongue
above
sweet
zephyr
waft
me
to
my
when
off
she
lept
upon
his
wings
to
fly
but
as
a
dead
stone
from
a
height
let
fall
silent
and
straight
is
gather
by
the
force
of
earth
vast
mass
upon
its
weight
so
small
in
speed
increasing
as
it
nears
its
source
of
motion
by
which
law
all
things
are
clutch
and
dragg
and
held
so
fell
she
there
like
a
dead
stone
down
in
her
headlong
course
the
disregardful
silence
heard
her
strike
upon
the
solid
crags
her
dismal
shriek
rang
on
the
rocks
and
died
out
along
the
vale
in
hurried
trebles
weak
and
soon
upon
her
from
their
skiey
haunt
fell
to
their
feast
the
great
birds
bald
and
gaunt
and
gorged
on
her
fair
flesh
with
bloody
beak
but
psyche
when
her
sister
was
gone
forth
went
out
again
her
wandering
way
to
take
and
following
a
stream
that
led
her
north
after
some
days
she
pass
the

athena

stands
and
he
who
traverses
the
isle
from
sea
to

may
by
the
plain
his
shortest
journey
make
till
on
the
northern
coast
arrived
she
came
upon
a
city
built
about
a
port
the
which
she
knew
soon
as
she
heard
the
name
was
where
her
elder
sister
had
her
court
to
whom
as
eros
had
commanded
her
she
now
in
turn
became
the
messenger
of
vengeful
punishment
that
fell
not
short
for
she
too
hearing

standing

that
drifted
from

his

that
had
the
goddess
learnt
the
tale
of

loved
and
eros
burnt
she
so
long
had
kept
aloof
and
dumb
wherefore

the

rising
from

he
skim
between

chasing

such
grace
have
none

he
into
the

then
down
he
dived
and
rowing
with
his
glistening
wings
arrived
at
aphrodite
bower
beneath
the

the

from

silver
pinions
the
crimson
green

floss
that
grew
about
the

and
at
his

its
graceful
silk
and
gently
waved
anew
till

here
and
there
the
queen
he
found
stray
from
her
haunt
unto
a
sandy
ground
dappl
with
in

blue
she
as
he
came
upon
her
from

with

outwit
fondly

in

rare
but
he
with
garrulous
and
laughing
tongue
broke
up
his
news
how
eros
fallen
sick
lay
tossing
on
his
bed
to
frenzy
stung
by
such
a
burn
as
did
but
barely
prick
a
little

no

than
a

upon

was
that

his

which

hath

this
many
a

at
all
in
any

and
thou
dear

piped
he
not
been

amongst
us
now
a
dreary
space
the
pining
mortals
suffer
from
a
dearth
of

and
for
this
sadness
of
the
earth
thy

is
darken
with
disgrace
on
the
secret
paths
of
dale
and
wood
where
lovers
walk
are
lovers
none
to
find
and
friends
besworn
to
equal
brotherhood
forget
their

and
part
with

unkind
in

moon
thy

i
coud
tell
even
of
the
that
fly
and

behind

over
but
the
merry
pipe
that
wont
to
cheer
the
harvesting
is
mute
and
in
the
vineyards
where
the
grape
is
ripe
no

is
heard
of
them
that
take

the

while
on

then

the

said

there
again
was

as
soon
as
if
he
had
but
dipt
for
prey
and
now
or
he
join
his
wailful

once
more
he
stood
upon

rock
and
preen
his
ruffl
quills
for
fresh
display
but
as
ill
tidings
will
their
truth
assure
without
more
witness
than
their
fatal
sense
so
since
was
nothing
bitterer
to
endure
the
injured
goddess
guess
the
full
offence
and
doubted
only
whether
first
to
smite
or
psyche
for
her
new
presumptuous
flight
or
eros
for
his
disobedience
but
full
of
anger
to
her

went
and

him
in

chamber
laid
and
with

sweet
euphrosynè
attent
upon

aye
as

shifted
the

with

scornfully
his

thus
upbraid

fruiting
thus
untimely
to
my

backsliding
from
commandment
ay
and
worse
with
bliss
to
favour
one
i
bade
thee
curse
and
save
the
life
i
left
with
thee
for
lost
too
to
burn
with
love
and
love
of
her
whom
i
did
hate
and
to
thy
bed
to
take
my
rival
that
my
trusted
officer
might
of
mine

my

make
dost
thou
then
think
my
love
for
thee
so
fond
and
miserably
doting
that
the
bond
by
such
dishonour
strainèd
will
not
break
that
i

thine

me
kinder
service
than

my
foes
and
keep
my

fair
thou

beguiled
in
amours
strange
my

thy
valiant

wilt
further
foul
it
now
with

i
do
as
thou
may
have

to
kill
thy

girl
whether
thou
love
her
still
or
of
her
silly
charms
already
tire
me
but
where
she
hides
and
eros
now
proud
in
his
woe
boasted
his
happy
theft
confessing
he
had
loved
her
well
and
how
by
her
own
doing
she
was
lost
and
left
and
homeless
in
such
sorrow
as
outwent
the
utmost
pain
of
other
punishment
was
wandering
of
his
love
and
favour
reft
by
which
was
cypris
gladden
not
appeased
but
hid
her
joy
and
spake
no
more
her
threat
and
left
with
face
like
one
that
much
displeased
hath
yet
betray
that
he
can
wrong
forget
when
lo
as
swiftly
she
came
stepping
down
from
her
fair
house
into
the
heavenly
town
the
kronian
sisters
on
the
way
she
met
hera
the
wife
of
zeus
her
placid
front
dark
with
the
shadow
of
his
troubl
reign
and
tall
demeter
who
with
men
once
wont
holding
the
high
olympians
in
disdain
for
persephassa
rape
which
now
forgiven
she
had
return
unto
the
courts
of
heaven
and
the
immortals
liv
at
peace
again
whose
smile
told
aphrodite
that
they
knew
the
meaning
of
her
visit
and
a
flush
of
anger
answer
them
while
hot
she
grew
but
hera
laugh
outright
thou
dost
blush
now
see
we
modest
manners
on
my
life
and
all
thy
little

wife
can
make
the
crimson
to
thy
forehead
rush
think
he
whom
thou
madest
passion
prince
no
privy
dart
then
for
himself
would
poise
nay
by
the
cuckoo
on
my
sceptre
since
was
love
that
made
thee
mother
of
his
joys
art
thou
the
foremost
to
his
favour
bound
as
thou
shouldst
be
the
last
to
think
to
sound
the
heart
and
least
of
all
thy
wanton
boy
but
her
demeter
on
whose
stalwart
arm
she
lean
took
up
thou
wilt
hark
to
me
this
psyche
said
she
the
heavenly
charm
and
will
become
immortal
and
maybe
to
marry
with
a
woman
is
as
well
as
wed
a
god
and
live
below
in
hell
as
was
my
lot
in
child
of
mine
to
see
which
things
they
both
said
fearing
in
their
hearts
that
savage
eros
if
they
mockt
his
case
would
kill
their
peace
with
his
revengeful
darts
and
bring
them
haply
to
a
worse
disgrace
but
aphrodite
saying
my
dames
behind
this
smoke
i
see
the
spite
that
flames
left
them
and
on
her
journey
went
apace
for
having
purposed
she
would
hold
no
truce
with
psyche
or
her
son
was
in
her
mind
to
go
forthwith
unto
the
throne
of
zeus
and
beg
that
hermes
might
be
sent
to
find
the
wanderer
and
secure
that
in
such
quest
he
would
not
fail
she
ponder
but
how
best
she
might
inflict
her
vengeance
october
heavy
meanwhile
at
heart
with
bruisèd
feet
was
psyche
wandering
many
nights
and
days
upon
the
paths
of
crete
and
chose
to
step
the
most
deserted
ways
being
least
unhappy
when
she
went
unseen
since
else
her
secret
sorrow
had
no
screen
from
the
plain
question
of
men
idle
gaze
yet
she
went
one
hope
she
had
like
mortal
mourners
who
reason
strong
hope
to
be
unexpectedly
made
glad
with
sight
of
their
dead
friends
so
much
they
long
so
she
for
him
whom
loss
a
thousandfold
endear
and
made
desired
nor
coud
she
hold
he
would
not
turn
and
quite
forgive
her
wrong
wherefore
her
eager
eyes
in
every
place
lookt
for
her
lover
and
hope
and
fear
she
follow
oft
afar
some
form
of
grace
in
pain
alike
to
lose
or
venture
near
and
still
this
thought
cheer
her
fatigue
that
he
or
on
some
hill
or
by
some
brook
or
tree
but
waited
for
her
coming
to
appear
and
then
for
comfort
many
an
old
and
doleful
ditty
would
she
gently
sing
writ
by
sad
poets
of
a
lover
lost
now
sounding
sweeter
for
her
sorrowing
sweet
echo
watching
up
on
high
say
hast
thou
seen
my
love
go
by
or
where
thou
sittest
by
thy
mossy
spring
say
ye
nymphs
that
from
the
crystal
rills
when
ye
have
bathed
your
limbs
from
morn
till
eve
flying
at
midnight
to
the
hills
beneath
the
stars
your
mazy
dances
weave
say
my
deserter
whom
ye
well
may
know
by
his
small
wings
his
quiver
and
his
bow
say
have
ye
seen
my
love
whose
loss
i
grieve
till
climb
one
evening
on
a
rocky
steep
above
the
plain
of
cisamos
that
lay
robb
of
its
golden
harvest
in
the
deep
mountainous
shadows
of
the
dying
day
she
saw
a
temple
whose
tall
columns
fair
recall
her
home
and
if
thou
be
there
my
love
she
cried
not
again
away
swiftly
she
ran
and
entering
by
the
door
she
stood
alone
within
an
empty
fane
of
great
demeter
and
behold
the
floor
was
litter
with
of
grain
with
wheat
and
together
heapt
in
holy
of
them
that
reapt
the
goddess
plenteous
gifts
upon
the
plain
and
on
the
tithe
the
tackle
of
the
tithe
thrown
by
in
such
confusion
as
are
laid
upon
the
swath
sickle
and
hook
and
scythe
when
midday
drives
the
reapers
to
the
shade
and
psyche
since
had
come
no
priestess
there
to
trim
the
temple
in
her
pious
care
forgat
herself
and
lent
her
duteous
aid
she
drew
the
offerings
from
the
midst
aside
and
piled
the
sheaves
at
every
pillar
base
and
sweeping
therebetween
a
passage
wide
made
clear
of
corn
and
chaff
the
temple
space
as
countrymen
who
bring
their
wheat
to
mart
set
out
their
show
along
the
walls
apart
by
their
allotted
stations
each
in
place
thus
she
and
felt
no
weariness
such
strength
hath
duty
to
support
our
feeble
frame
till
all
was
set
in
order
and
at
length
up
to
the
threshold
of
the
shrine
she
came
when
lo
before
her
face
with
friendly
smile
tall
as
a
pillar
of
the
peristyle
the
goddess
stood
reveal
and
call
her
name
psyche
said
she
thou
not
how
aphrodite
to
thy
hurt
is
sworn
and
thou
thy
peril
and
her
wrath
forgot
spendest
thy
thought
my
temple
to
adorn
take
better
heed
and
psyche
at
the
voice
even
of
so
little
comfort
gan
rejoice
and
at
her
feet
pour
out
this
prayer
forlorn
gracious
giver
of
the
golden
grain
hide
me
i
pray
thee
from
her
wrath
unkind
for
who
can
pity
as
canst
thou
my
pain
who
wert

a
wanderer
vex
in

for

of
thy

my

and
take
my

or
if

i
aid

and
if
now
i
close

to
thee
take

psyche
hope
founder
as
when
a
ship
the
morrow
of
the
gale
can
hardly
ride
the
swollen
seas
fetching
a
deeper
dip
at
every
wave
and
through
her
gaping
side
and
her
shattered
bulwark
ever
drinks
till
plunging
in
the
watery
wild
she
sinks
to
scoop
her
grave
beneath
the
crushing
tide
so
with
each
word
her
broken
spirit
drank
its
doom
and
overwhelm
with
deep
despair
she
turn
away
and
coming
forth
she
sank
silently
weeping
on
the
temple
stair
in
midmost
night
forspent
with
long
turmoil
but
sleep
the
gracious
pursuivant
of
toil
came
swiftly
down
and
nursed
away
her
care
and
when
the
sun
awaked
her
with
his
beams
she
found
new
hope
that
still
her
sorrow
cure
lay
with
the
gods
who
in
her
morning
dreams
had
sent
her
comfort
in
a
vision
sure
wherein
the
almightiest
god
zeus
himself
had
seem
to
nod
and
bid
her
with
good
heart
her
woes
endure
so
coming
that
same
day
unto
a
shrine
of
hera
she
took
courage
and
went
in
and
like
to
one
that
to
the
cell
divine
for
favour
ventures
or
a
suit
to
win
she
drew
anigh
the
altar
from
her
face
wiping
the
tears
ere
to
the
heavenly
grace
as
thus
she
pray
she
would
her
prayer
begin
honour
lady
who
from
ancient
doom
wert
made
heaven
wife
and
art
on
earth
besought
with
gracious
happiness
of
all
to
whom
thy
holy
wedlock
hath
my
burden
brought
save
me
from
aphrodite
fell
pursuit
and
guard
unto
the
birth
love
hapless
fruit
which
she
for
cruel
spite
would
bring
to
nought
once
from
her
thou
wert
not
shamed
to
take
her
beauty
zone
thy
beauty
to
enhance
for
which
again
zeus
loved
thee
to
forsake
his
warlike
ire
in
faithful
dalliance
show
me
what
means
may
win
my
love
to
me
or
how
that
i
may
come
if
so
may
be
within
the
favour
of
his
countenance
there
be
any
place
for
tears
or
prayer
if
there
be
need
for
succour
in
distress
now
is
the
very
hour
of
all
despair
here
is
the
heart
of
grief
and
bitterness
motherly
pity
bend
thy
face
and
grant
one
beam
of
ruth
to
thy
poor
suppliant
nor
turn
me
from
thine
altar
comfortless
even
as
she
pray
a
cloud
spread
through
the
cell
and
the
wreathings
of
the
vapour
dim
the
goddess
grew
in
glory
visible
like
some
barbaric
queen
in
festal
trim
such
the
attire
and
ornaments
she
wore
when
the
forgèd
threshold
of
the
floor
of
zeus
house
she
stept
to
visit
him
from
either
ear
ring
to
its
piercèd
lobe
a
triple
jewel
hung
with
gold
and
her
breasts
her
wide
ambrosial
robe
with
many
a
shining
golden
clasp
was
the
flowering
on
its
smooth
embroider
lawn
gather
to
colour
where
the
zone
was
drawn
in
fringe
of
golden
tassels
at
her
waist
her
curling
hair
with
plaited
braid
and
brail
pendant
or
loop
about
her
head
divine
lay
hidden
half
beneath
a
golden
veil
bright
as
the
rippling
ocean
in
sunshine
and
on
the
ground
flashing
she
stept
beneath
her
feet
the
dazzling
lightnings
lept
from
the
gold
network
of
her
sandals
fine
thus
hera
stood
in
royal
guise
bedeckt
before
poor
psyche
on
the
stair
that
knelt
whose
hope
at
that
display
was
checkt
and
all
her
happier
thoughts
gan
fade
and
melt
she
saw
no
kindness
in
such
haughty
mien
and
venturing
not
to
look
upon
the
queen
bow
down
in
woe
to
hear
her
sentence
dealt
and
thus
the
goddess
spake
vain
thou
suest
most
miserable
psyche
though
my
heart
be
full
of
hate
for
her
whose
hate
thou
ruest
and
pride
and
pity
move
me
to
thy
part
yet
not
till
zeus
make
known
his
will
coud
i
least
of
the
blameless
gods
that
dwell
on
high
assist
thee
wert
thou
worthier
than
thou
art
know
if
eros
love
thee
that
thy
hopes
should
rest
on
him
and
i
would
bid
thee
go
where
in
his
mother
house
apart
he
mopes
grieving
for
loss
of
thee
in
secret
woe
for
should
he
take
thee
back
there
is
no
power
in
earth
or
heaven
will
hurt
thee
from
that
hour
nay
not
if
zeus
himself
should
prove
thy
foe
thus
saying
she
was
gone
and
psyche
now
surprised
by
comfort
rose
and
went
her
way
resolved
in
heart
and
only
wondering
how
was
possible
to
come
where
eros
lay
since
that
her
feet
however
she
might
roam
coud
never
travel
to
the
heavenly
home
of
love
beyond
the
bounds
of
mortal
day
yet
must
she
come
to
him
and
now
was
proved
how
that
to
lovers
as
is
told
in
song
seeking
the
way
no
place
is
far
removed
nor
is
there
any
obstacle
so
strong
nor
bar
so
fix
that
it
can
hinder
them
and
how
to
reach
heaven
gate
by
stratagem
vex
not
the
venturous
heart
of
psyche
long
to
face
her
enemy
might
well
avail
wherefore
to
cypris
shrine
her
steps
she
bent
hoping
the
goddess
in
her
hate
might
hale
her
body
to
the
skies
for
punishment
to
be
yet
now
her
fiercest
wrath
seem
happiest
fortune
seeing
was
the
path
whereby
alone
unto
her
love
she
went
november
but
aphrodite
to
the
house
of
zeus
being
bound
bade
beckon
out
her
milkwhite
steeds
four
doves
that
ready
to
her
royal
use
in
golden
cages
stood
and
peck
the
seeds
best
of
the
nimble
air
folk
that
wore
with
pride
the
marking
of
her
yoke
and
cooed
in
envy
of
her
gentle
needs
these
drew
in
turn
her
chariot
when
in
state
along
the
heaven
with
all
her
train
she
fared
and
oft
in
journeying
to
the
skiey
gate
of
zeus
palace
high
their
flight
had
dared
which
darkest
vapour
and
thick
glooms
enshroud
above
all
else
in
the
perpetual
cloud
wherethro
to
mount
again
they
stood
prepared
sleeking
their
feathers
by
her
shining
car
the
same
hephæstos
wrought
for
her
when
he
bruised
in
his
hideous
fall
from
heaven
afar
was
nursed
by
thetis
and
eurynomè
the
daughter
of
the
main
with
whom
he
dwelt
till
he
grew
sound
again
down
in
a
hollow
cave
beside
the
sea
and
them
for
kindness
done
was
prompt
to
serve
forging
them
brooches
rich
in
make
and
mode
earrings
and
supple
chains
of
jointed
curve
and
other
trinkets
while
he
there
abode
and
none
of
gods
or
men
knew
of
his
home
but
they
two
only
and
the
salt
to
and
fro
past
his
cavern
ever
flow
was
then
he
wrought
this
work
within
the
cave
emboss
with
rich
design
a
moonèd
car
and
when
return
to
heaven
to
venus
gave
in
form
imagined
like
her
crescent
star
which
circling
nearest
earth
maketh
at
night
to
wakeful
mortal
men
shadow
and
light
alone
of
all
the
stars
in
heaven
that
are
two
slender
wheels
it
had
with
fretted
tires
of
biting
adamant
to
take
firm
hold
of
cloud
or
ether
and
their
whirling
fires
threw
off
the
air
in
halo
where
they
roll
and
either
nave
that
round
the
axle
a
ruby
was
whose
steady
crimson
betwixt
the
twin
fans
of
gold
thereon
the
naked
goddess
mounting
shook
the
reins
whereat
the
doves
their
wings
outspread
and
rising
high
their
flight
to
heaven
they
took
and
all
the
birds
that
in
those
courts
were
bred
of
her
broad
eaves
the
nested
families
sparrows
and
swallows
join
their
companies
awhile
and
twitter
to
her
overhead
but
onward
she
with
fading
tracks
of
flame
sped
swiftly
till
she
reacht
her
journey
end
and
when
within
the
house
of
zeus
she
came
she
pray
the
sire
of
heaven
that
he
would
lend
hermes
the
for
her
hest
and
he
being
granted
her
at
her
request
she
went
forthwith
to
seek
him
and
to
send
who
happ
within
the
palace
then
to
wait
upon
the
almighty
pleasure
and
her
tale
was
quickly
told
and
he
made
answer
straight
that
he
would
find
the
truant
without
fail
asking
the
goddess
by
what
signs
her
slave
might
best
be
known
and
what
the
price
she
gave
for
capture
or
admitted
for
the
bail
all
which
he
took
his
silver
stile
to
write
in
letters
large
upon
a
waxed
board
her
age
and
name
her
colour
face
and
height
her
home
and
parentage
and
the
reward
and
then
read
as
was
to
be
proclaim
and
she
took
oath
to
give
the
price
she
named
without
demur
when
psyche
was
restored
then
on
his
head
he
closely
set
his
cap
with
earèd
wings
erect
and
his
knee
he
cross
each
foot
in
turn
to
prove
the
strap
that
bound
his
wingèd
sandals
and
shook
free
his
chlamys
and
gat
up
and
in
his
hand
taking
his
fair
herald
wand
lept
forth
on
air
accoutred
and
piloting
along
the
sky
held
southward
till
the
narrow
map
of
crete
lay
like
a
fleck
in
azure
his
eye
when
down
he
came
and
as
an
eagle
fleet
drops
in
some
combe
then
checks
his
headlong
stoop
with
wing
wheeling
in
level
swoop
to
strike
the
bleating
quarry
with
his
feet
thus
he
alighted
and
in
every
town
in
all
the
isle
before
the
close
of
day
had
cried
the
message
which
he
carried
down
of
psyche
aphrodite
runaway
that
whosoever
found
the
same
and
caught
and
by
such
time
unto
her
temple
brought
to
him
the
goddess
would
this
guerdon
pay
six
honied
kisses
from
her
rosy
mouth
would
cytherea
give
and
one
beside
to
quench
at
heart
for
aye
love
mortal
drouth
but
unto
him
that
hid
her
woe
betide
which
now
was
on
all
tongues
and
psyche
name
herself
or
ever
nigh
she
came
to
aphrodite
temple
where
she
hied
when
since
she
found
her
way
to
heaven
was
safe
she
only
wisht
to
make
it
soon
and
sure
nor
fear
to
meet
the
goddess
in
her
chafe
so
she
her
might
secure
and
not
be
given
of
other
for
the
price
nor
was
there
need
of
any
artifice
her
once
resplendent
beauty
to
obscure
for
now
so
changed
she
was
by
heavy
woe
that
for
the
little
likeness
that
she
bore
to
her
description
she
was
fear
to
go
within
the
fane
and
when
she
stood
before
the
priestess
scarce
coud
she
with
oath
persuade
that
she
was
psyche
the
renownèd
maid
whom
men
had
left
the
temple
to
adore
but
when
to
hermes
she
was
shown
and
given
he
took
no
doubt
but
eager
to
be
quit
and
proud
of
speed
return
with
her
to
heaven
and
left
her
with
the
proclamation
writ
hung
at
her
neck
the
board
with
letters
large
at
aphrodite
gate
with
those
in
charge
and
up
whence
first
he
came
made
haste
to
flit
but
hapless
psyche
fell
for
so
it
chanced
to
moody
synethea
care
the
one
of
aphrodite
train
whom
she
advanced
to
try
the
work
abandon
by
her
son
who
by
perpetual
presence
made
ill
end
of
good
or
bad
though
she
coud
both
amend
and
merit
praise
for
work
by
her
begun
but
she
to
better
thought
her
heart
had
shut
and
proved
she
had
a
spite
beyond
compare
nor
coud
the
keenest
taunts
her
anger
glut
which
she
when
sour
was
never
wont
to
spare
and
now
she
mock
at
psyche
shame
and
grief
as
only
she
might
do
and
to
her
chief
along
the
courtyard
dragg
her
by
the
hair
nor
now
was
aphrodite
kinder
grown
having
her
hated
rival
in
her
power
she
laught
for
joy
and
in
triumphant
tone
bade
her
a
merry
welcome
to
her
bower
tis
fit
indeed
should
wait
upon
their
mothers
but
thou
comest
late
psyche
i
lookt
for
thee
before
this
hour
yet
thus
gave
she
rein
to
jeer
and
gibe
me
if
i
held
thee
negligent
or
if
accustom
vanity
ascribe
an
honour
to
myself
that
was
not
meant
thy
lover
is
it
who
so
dearly
prized
the
pretty
soul
then
left
her
and
despised
to
him
more
like
thy
heavenward
steps
were
bent
without
reason
zeus
i
tell
thee
to
hear
the
story
of
the
drop
of
oil
the
revelation
and
the
ghastly
wound
my
merriment
is
but
my
fear
recoil
but
if
my
son
was
unkind
thou
shalt
see
how
kind
a
goddess
can
his
mother
be
to
bring
thy
tainted
honour
clear
of
soil
and
so
to
match
her
promise
with
her
mirth
two
of
her
ministers
she
call
in
ken
that
work
the
melancholy
of
the
earth
merimna
that
with
care
perplexes
when
the
hearts
of
mortals
have
the
gods
forgot
and
lypè
that
her
sorrow
spares
them
not
when
mortals
have
forgot
their
fellow
men
these
like
twin
sharks
that
in
a
fair
ship
wake
swim
constant
showing
the
water
blue
their
shearing
fins
and
hasty
ravin
make
of
overthrow
or
offal
so
these
two
on
aphrodite
passing
follow
hard
and
now
she
offer
to
their
glut
regard
sweet
psyche
with
command
their
wont
to
do
but
in
what
secret
chamber
their
foul
task
these
plied
or
what
their
skill
pity
of
tender
nature
may
not
ask
nor
poet
stain
his
rhyme
with
such
an
ill
but
they
at
last
themselves
turn
from
their
rack
weary
of
cruelty
and
led
her
back
saying
that
further
torture
were
to
kill
then
when
the
goddess
saw
her
more
she
mockt
thou
the
woman
of
the
earth
she
said
hast
in
sorceries
mine
eros
lockt
and
stood
thyself
for
worship
in
my
stead
looking
that
i
should
pity
thee
or
care
for
what
illicit
offspring
thou
bear
or
let
thee
to
that
god
my
son
be
wed
know
thy
trick
and
thou
art
one
of
them
who
steal
love
favour
in
the
gentle
way
wearing
submission
for
a
diadem
patience
and
suffering
for
thy
rich
array
thou
wilt
be
modest
kind
implicit
so
to
rest
thy
wily
spirit
out
of
show
that
it
may
leap
the
livelier
into
play
at
doing
nothing
if
so
be
the
grace
become
thee
well
but
active
yet
above
all
others
be
there
none
to
see
thy
business
and
thine
eager
face
asweat
lo
i
will
prove
thy
talent
thou
live
and
all
that
thou
desirest
will
i
give
if
thou
perform
the
task
which
i
shall
set
she
took
her
then
aside
and
bade
her
heed
a
heap
of
grains
piled
high
upon
the
floor
millet
and
mustard
hemp
and
poppy
seed
and
undistinguishable
spore
all
kinds
of
pulse
of
grasses
and
of
spice
clover
and
linseed
rape
and
corn
and
rice
dodder
and
sesame
and
many
more
me
these
seeds
she
said
now
is
night
i
will
return
at
morning
if
i
find
that
thou
hast
separated
all
aright
each
grain
from
other
grain
after
its
kind
and
set
them
in
unmingl
heaps
apart
then
shall
thy
wish
be
granted
to
thine
heart
whereat
she
turn
and
closed
the
door
behind
fourth
quarter
winter
psyche
trials
and
reception
into
heaven
december
a
single
lamp
there
stood
beside
the
heap
and
shed
thereon
its
mocking
golden
light
such
as
might
tempt
the
weary
eye
to
sleep
rather
than
prick
the
nerve
of
taskèd
sight
yet
psyche
not
to
fail
for
lack
of
zeal
with
good
will
sat
her
down
to
her
ordeal
sorting
the
larger
seeds
as
best
she
might
when
lo
upon
the
wall
a
shadow
past
of
doubtful
shape
across
the
chamber
dim
moving
with
speed
and
seeing
nought
that
cast
the
shade
she
bent
her
down
the
flame
to
trim
and
there
the
beast
itself
a
little
ant
climb
up
in
compass
of
the
lustre
scant
upon
the
bowl
of
oil
ran
round
the
rim
smiling
to
see
the
creature
of
her
fear
so
dwarf
by
truth
she
watcht
him
where
he
crept
for
mere
distraction
telling
in
his
ear
what
straits
she
then
was
in
and
telling
wept
whereat
he
stood
and
trim
his
horns
but
ere
her
tale
was
done
resumed
his
manner
scare
ran
down
and
on
his
way
in
darkness
kept
but
she
intent
drew
forth
with
dextrous
hand
the
larger
seeds
or
push
the
smaller
back
or
light
from
heavy
with
her
breathing
fan
when
suddenly
she
saw
the
floor
grow
black
and
troops
of
ants
flowing
in
noiseless
train
moved
to
the
hill
of
seeds
as
a
plain
armies
approach
a
city
for
attack
and
gathering
on
the
grain
began
to
strive
with
grappling
horns
and
each
from
out
the
heap
his
burden
drew
and
all
their
motion
live
struggled
and
slid
upon
the
surface
steep
and
psyche
wonder
watching
them
to
find
the
creatures
separated
kind
from
kind
till
dizzied
with
the
sight
she
fell
asleep
and
when
she
woke
was
with
the
morning
sound
of
aphrodite
anger
at
the
door
whom
high
amaze
stay
backward
as
she
found
her
foe
asleep
with
all
her
trouble
and
round
the
room
beheld
in
order
due
the
piles
arranged
distinct
and
sorted
true
grain
with
grain
seed
with
seed
and
spore
with
spore
she
fiercely
cried
shalt
not
thus
escape
for
to
this
marvel
thou
not
pretend
there
is
but
one
that
could
this
order
shape
demeter
but
i
knew
her
not
thy
friend
therefore
another
trial
will
i
set
in
which
she
can
not
aid
thee
nor
abet
but
thou
thyself
must
bring
it
fair
to
end
thereon
she
sped
her
to
the
bounds
of
thrace
and
set
her
by
a
river
deep
and
wide
and
said
east
beyond
this
stream
a
race
of
sheep
at
pasture
bide
go
seek
them
out
and
this
thy
task
to
pull
but
one
lock
for
me
of
their
precious
wool
and
give
it
in
my
hands
at
eventide
do
and
thou
shalt
have
thy
heart
desire
which
said
she
fled
and
left
her
by
the
stream
and
psyche
then
with
courage
still
entire
had
plunged
therein
but
now
of
great
esteem
her
life
she
rated
while
it
lent
a
spell
wherein
she
yet
might
hope
to
quit
her
well
and
in
one
winning
all
her
woes
redeem
there
as
she
stood
in
doubt
a
fluting
voice
rose
from
the
flood
be
not
afraid
to
hear
a
reed
give
tongue
for
was
of
choice
that
i
from
mortal
flesh
a
plant
was
made
my
name
is
syrinx
once
from
mighty
pan
into
the
drowning
river
as
i
ran
a
fearful
prayer
my
steps
for
ever
stay
by
that
change
in
many
climes
i

and

my
lover
who
to
me
alone
is
true
and
does
me
honour
i
forgive
nor
if
i

in
sorrow
my
own
rather
for
thee
my

i
now
uplift
to
warn
thee
plunge
not
in
the
river
swift
nor
seek
the
golden
sheep
to
men
unknown
thou
should
cross
the
stream
which
may
not
be
thou
coudst
not
climb
upon
the
hanging
rocks
nor
ever
as
the
goddess
bade
thee
see
the
pasture
of
the
flocks
or
if
thou
coud
their
herded
horns
would
gore
and
slay
thee
on
the
crags
or
thrust
thee
ere
thou
coudst
rob
them
of
their
golden
locks
goddess
means
thy
death
but
i
can
show
how
thy
obedience
yet
may
thwart
her
will
at
noon
the
golden
flocks
descend
below
leaving
the
scented
herbage
of
the
hill
and
where
the
shelving
banks
to
shallows
fall
drink
at
the
rippling
water
one
and
all
nor
back
return
till
they
have
drawn
their

command
a
thornbush
that
it
stoop
over
some
ram
that
steppeth
by
in
peace
and
him
in
all
its
prickles
firmly
coop
making
thee
seizure
of
his
golden
fleece
so
without
peril
of
his
angry
horns
shalt
thou
be
quit
for
he
upon
the
thorns
must
leave
his
ransom
ere
he
win
release
then
psyche
thankt
her
for
her
kind
befriending
and
hid
among
the
rushes
looking
east
and
when
noon
came
she
saw
the
flock
descending
out
of
the
hills
and
lo
one
golden
beast
caught
in
a
thornbush
and
the
mighty
brute
struggl
and
tore
it
from
its
twisted
root
into
the
stream
or
he
was
and
when
they
water
were
and
gone
the
breeze
floated
the
freighted
thorn
where
psyche
lay
whence
she
unhook
the
golden
wool
at
ease
and
back
to
heaven
for
passage
swift
gan
pray
and
hermes
who
was
sent
to
be
her
guide
ifso
she
lived
came
down
at
eventide
and
bore
her
thither
ere
the
close
of
day
but
when
the
goddess
saw
the
locks
of
gold
held
to
her
hands
her
heart
with
wrath
desperate
thou
and
by
abetting
bold
that
dost
outwit
me
prove
thee
as
i
can
yet
this
work
is
not
thine
there
is
but
one
of
all
the
gods
who
coud
the
thing
have
done
hast
thou
a
friend
too
in
the
lusty
pan
give
thee
trial
where
he
can
not
aid
which
said
she
led
her
to
a
torrid
land
level
and
black
but
not
with
flood
or
shade
for
nothing
coud
the
mighty
heat
withstand
which
aye
from
morn
till
eve
the
naked
sun
pour
on
that
plain
where
never
foot
had
run
nor
any
herb
sprung
on
its
molten
sand
far
off
a
gloomy
mountain
rose
alone
and
aphrodite
thither
pointing

lies
thy
task
out
of
the
topmost
stone
of
yonder
hill
upwells
a
fountain

take
thou
this
goblet
brimming
must
thou
bring
its
cup
with
water
from
that
sacred
spring
if
ever
to
my
son
thou
wouldst
be
saying
she
gave
into
her
hands
a
bowl
cut
of
one
crystal
open
broad
and
fair
and
bade
her
at
all
hazard
keep
it
whole
for
heaven
held
nought
beside
so
fine
or
rare
then
was
she
gone
and
psyche
on
the
plain
now
doubted
if
she
ever
should
regain
the
love
of
eros
strove
she
yet
as
a
helmsman
at
the
word
to
tack
swiftly
without
a
thought
puts
down
his
helm
so
psyche
turn
to
tread
that
desert
black
since
was
no
fear
that
coud
her
heart
nor
knew
she
that
she
went
the
fount
to
seek
of
cold
cocytus
springing
to
the
peak
secretly
from
his
source
in
pluto

all
night

and
at

come
to
the
rock
gazed
up
in
vain
around
nothing
she
saw
but
precipices
vast
ruined
scarps
with
rugged
ridges
crown
and
creeping
to
a
cleft
to
rest
in
shade
or
the
desperate
venture
she
assay
she
fell
asleep
upon
the
stony
ground
a
dream
came
to
her
thus
she
stood
alone
within
her
palace
in
the
high
ravine
where
nought
but
she
was
changed
but
she
to
stone
worshippers
throng
the
court
and
still
were
seen
folk
flying
from
the
peak
who
ever
more
flying
and
flying
lighted
on
the
floor
cried
they
of
eros
adorèd
a
hurtling
of
the

sunken

her

for

shall
turn

truly
do
the
service
which
it
feign
thus
as
he
spake
his
talons
made
he
ring
around
the

bowl
and
soaring
high
descended
as
from

upon
the

nor
dared
the
hornèd
snakes
of

deny
the

that
bore
his

to
fill
it
with
their
trusted

up
thence
to
the
king
of

therewith
to

but
he
to
psyche
bent
his
gracious
speed
and
bidding
her
to
mount
his
feather
back
bore
her
aloft
as
once
young
ganymede
nor
ever
made
his
steady
flight
to
slack
ere
that
he
set
her
down
beside
her
goal
and
gave
into
her
hands
the
crystal
bowl
unspill
with
the
water
black
january
but
eros
now
recover
from
his
hurt
felt
other
pangs
for
who
would
not
relent
weighing
the
small
crime
and
unmatch
desert
of
psyche
with
her
cruel
punishment
and
shamed
he
grew
to
be
so
near
allied
to
her
who
by
her
taunts
awoke
his
pride
as
his
compassion
by
her
spite
unspent
which
aphrodite
seeing
wax
more
firm
that
he
should
never
meet
with
psyche
more
and
had
in
thought
already
set
the
term
to
their
communion
with
that
trial
sore
which
sent
her
forth
upon
a
quest
accurst
and
not
to
be
accomplisht
that
of
thirst
she
there
might
perish
on
hell
torrid
shore
and
now
it
chanced
that
she
had
called
her
son
into
her
to
unfold
psyche
destruction
that
her
fate
might
stun
what
love
remained
by
duty
uncontrol
and
he
to
hide
his
tears
rebellious
storm
was
fled
when
in
his
place
another
form
rose
the
golden
lintel
and
behold
psyche
herself
in
slow
and
balanced
strain
poising
the
crystal
bowl
with
fearful
heed
her
eyes
at
watch
upon
the
steadied
plane
and
whole
soul
gather
in
the
single
deed
onward
she
came
and
stooping
to
the
floor
set
down
the
cup
unspill
and
brimming
at
aphrodite
feet
and
rose
up
freed
surprise
the
goddess
and
she
too
stood
like
a
statue
but
with
passion
pale
till
when
her
victim
nothing
spake
she
threw
some
kindness
in
her
voice
and
bade
her
hail
but
in
the
smiling
judge
was
plain
to
see
saying
water
bringst
thou
here
to
me
that
justice
over
hate
should
not
prevail
then
psyche
said
is
the
biting
flood
of
black
cocytus
silver
with
the
gleam
of
souls
that
guilty
of
another
blood
are
pent
therein
and
as
they
swim
they
scream
the
hornèd
snakes
of
hell
upon
the
mount
enchain
for
ever
guard
the
livid
fount
and
but
the
fates
can
grant
to
touch
the
stream
the
goddess
cried
tis
plain
that
none
but
one
i
wot
of
coud
this
thing
have
wrought
that
which
another
doth
may
well
be
done
nor
thou
the
nearer
to
my
promise
brought
thou
buildest
on
a
hope
to
be
destroy
if
thou
accept
conditions
and
avoid
thy
parcel
nor
thyself
accomplish
aught
it
not
kindness
in
me
being
averse
to
all
thy
wish
to
yield
me
thus
to
grant
thy
heart
desire
and
nothing
loathe
i
worse
if
thou
wouldst
only
work
as
well
as
want
see
now
i
will
not
yet
be
all
denial
but
offer
thee
one
last
determining
trial
and
let
it
be
a
mutual
covenant
box
and
in
her
hands
she
took
a
pyx
of
dark
obsidian
rarest
green
and
therewith
beyond
tartarean
styx
go
thou
and
entering
hades
house
obscene
say
to
persephonè
is
thy
will
to
shew
me
so
much
favour
prithee
fill
this
little
vase
with
beauty
for
love
begs
but
what
shall
well
a
day
for
of
her
own
was
much
of
late
outspent
in
nursing
of
her
son
in
bed
who
lay
wounded
by
me
who
for
the
gift
am
then
bring
me
what
she
gives
and
with
all
speed
for
truth
to
say
i
stand
thou
seest
in
need
of
some
such
charm
in
my
disparagement
thou
return
to
me
with
that
acquist
having
thyself
the
journey
made
i
swear
that
day
to
give
thee
thou
list
an
be
it
my
son
now
psyche
wilt
thou
dare
and
psyche
said
this
thou
truly
mean
i
will
go
down
to
tartarus
obscene
and
beg
of
hades
queen
thy
beauty
there
me
the
way
but
aphrodite
said
thou
find
yet
i
will
place
thee
whence
a
way
there
is
mortals
have
on
it
sped
ay
and
return
thereby
so
let
us
hence
then
swift
to
earth
her
willing
prey
she
bore
and
left
her
on
the
wide
laconian
shore
alone
at
midnight
in
the
darkness
dense
was
winter
and
as
shivering
psyche
sat
waiting
for
morn
she
question
in
her
mind
what
place
the
goddess
meant
arrived
whereat
she
might
descend
to
hell
or
how
should
find
the
way
which
gods
to
living
men
deny
orpheus
nay
nor
hercules
am
i
said
she
loosen
where
the
great
gods
bind
and
when
at
length
the
dawn
broke
on
the
peaks
of
huge
taÿgetus
and
psyche
through
the
skirts
of
dark
withdrawn
look
on
that
promontory
mountainous
and
saw
taleton
in
snow
her
heart
sank
and
she
wept
with
head
bent
low
the
malice
of
her
foe
dispiteous
and
seeing
near
at
hand
an
ancient
tower
deserted
now
but
once
a
hold
of
men
she
came
thereto
and
though
was
all
her
power
mounted
its
steep
unbroken
stair
again
she
said
for
now
a
second
time
she
thought
to
die
little
height
i
climb
will
prove
my
shortest
road
to
pluto
den
must
i
come
to
tartarus
once
there
turn
as
i
may
and
straight
to
death
had
sprung
when
in
the
mossy
tower
the
imprison
air
was
shaken
and
the
hoary
stones
gave
tongue
firm
stand
firm
that
rugged
voice
outcried
such
as
choose
despondency
for
guide
hast
thou
not
heard
what
bitterest
fate
is
sung
for
i
the
road
and
means
can
teach
how
thou
come
to
hell
and
yet
escape
and
first
must
thou
that
upper
gate
to
reach
along
these
seagirt
hills
thy
journey
shape
to
where
the
land
in
sea
dips
furthest
south
at
tænarus
and
hades
earthly
mouth
hard
by
poseidon
temple
at
the
cape
may
one
descend
but
they
that
make
that
passage
down
must
go
provided
well
so
take
in
either
hand
a
of
pearlèd
barley
mix
with
hydromel
and
in
thy
mouth
two
doits
first
having
bound
the
pyx
beneath
thy
robe
enwrap
around
thus
set
thou
forth
and
mark
what
more
i
tell
thou
hast
gone
alone
some
half
thy
road
thou
wilt
a
lame
outwearied
ass
and
one
that
beats
him
tottering
his
load
of
loosely
bundl
wood
will
cry
help
me
kind
friend
my
faggots
to
but
thou
that
silly
cripple
words
mistrust
is
planted
for
thy
death
note
it
and
pass
when
thy
road
the
stygian
river
joins
where
woolly
charon
ferries
the
dead
he
will
demand
his
fare
one
of
thy
coins
force
with
thy
tongue
between
thy
teeth
thy
head
offering
instead
of
hand
to
give
the
doit
his
fingers
in
this
custom
are
adroit
and
thine
must
not
set
down
the
barleybread
in
his
crazy
bark
as
ferrying
the
stream
thou
sittest
one
that
seems
to
float
rather
than
swim
midway
shore
and
shore
will
stretch
his
fleshless
hand
upon
the
boat
and
beg
thee
of
thy
pity
take
him
in
shut
thy
soft
ear
unto
his
clamour
thin
nor
for
a
phantom
deed
thyself
devote
on
the
further
bank
when
thou
art
stept
three
wizen
women
weaving
at
the
woof
will
stop
and
pray
thee
in
their
art
adept
to
free
their
tangl
threads
hold
thou
aloof
for
this
and
other
traps
thy
foe
hath
to
make
thee
drop
the
cakes
out
of
thy
hand
putting
thy
prudence
to
perpetual
proof
by
one
cake
thou
comest
into
hell
and
by
one
cake
departest
since
the
hound
that
guards
the
gate
is
ever
pleasèd
well
to
taste
man
meal
or
sweeten
grain
unground
cast
him
a
cake
for
that
thou
go
free
even
to
the
mansion
of
persephonè
withouten
stay
or
peril
safe
and
sound
will
receive
thee
kindly
thou
decline
her
courtesies
and
make
the
floor
thy
seat
refusing
what
is
offer
food
or
wine
save
only
beg
a
crust
of
bread
to
eat
then
tell
thy
mission
and
her
present
take
which
when
thou
hast
set
forth
with
pyx
and
cake
one
in
each
hand
while
yet
thou
retreat
thy
second
cake
to
cerberus
the
coin
to
charon
and
that
way
whereby
thou
camest
following
thou
comest
thus
to
see
again
the
starry
choir
on
high
but
guard
thou
well
the
pyx
nor
once
uplift
the
lid
to
look
on
persephassa
gift
else
is
in
vain
i
bid
thee
now
not
die
then
psyche
thank
the
tower
and
stoopt
her
mouth
to
kiss
the
stones
upon
his
rampart
hoary
and
coming
down
his
stair
went
hasting
south
along
the
steep
tænarian
promontory
and
found
the
cave
and
temple
by
the
cape
and
took
the
cakes
and
coins
and
made
escape
beneath
the
earth
according
to
his
story
and
overtook
the
ass
but
lent
no
aid
and
offer
charon
with
her
teeth
his
fee
and
pass
the
floating
ghost
in
vain
who
pray
and
turned
her
back
upon
the
weavers
three
and
threw
the
to
that
cerberus
and
safe
and
sound
came
to
the
mansion
of
persephonè
kindly
received
she
courtesy
declined
sat
on
the
ground
ate
not
save
where
she
lay
a
crust
of
bread
reveal
the
goddess
mind
the
gift
took
and
return
upon
her
way
gave
cerberus
his
cake
charon
his
fare
and
saw
through
hell
mouth
to
the
purple
air
and
one
by
one
the
keen
stars
melt
in
day
awhile
from
so
long
journeying
in
the
shades
resting
at
tænarus
she
came
to
know
how
up
the
eastern
coast
some
forty
stades
there
stood
a
temple
of
her
goddess
foe
there
would
she
make
her
offering
there
reclaim
the
prize
which
now
was
happiness
to
name
the
joy
that
should
redeem
all
passèd
woe
and
wending
by
the
sunny
shore
at
noon
she
with
her
pyx
and
wondering
what
it
hid
of
what
kind
what
the
fashion
of
the
boon
coud
be
that
she
to
look
on
was
forbid
alas
for
innocence
so
hard
to
teach
at
fancy
prick
she
sat
her
on
the
beach
and
to
content
desire
lifted
the
lid
she
saw
within
nothing
but
her
sight
that
looked
on
nothing
gan
a
darkness
creep
a
cloudy
poison
mix
of
stygian
night
rapt
her
to
deadly
and
infernal
sleep
backward
she
fell
like
one
when
all
is
and
lay
outstretch
as
lies
upon
the
shore
a
drown
corpse
cast
up
by
the
murmuring
deep
february
while
eros
in
his
chamber
hid
his
tears
mourning
the
loss
of
psyche
and
her
fate
the
rumour
of
her
safety
reacht
his
ears
and
how
she
came
to
aphrodite
gate
whereat
with
hope
return
his
hardihood
and
secretly
he
purposed
while
he
coud
himself
to
save
her
from
the
goddess
hate
then
learning
what
he
might
and
guessing
more
his
ready
wit
came
soon
to
understand
the
journey
to
the
far
laconian
shore
whither
to
fly
and
seek
his
love
he
plan
and
making
good
escape
in
dark
of
night
ere
the
sun
crost
his
true
meridian
flight
he
by
teuthronè
struck
the
southern
strand
there
as
it
chanct
he
found
that
snowy
bird
of
crete
that
late
made
mischief
with
his
queen
and
now
along
the
cliffs
with
wings
sail
and
that
morn
had
cross
the
sea
between
whom
as
he
past
he
hail
and
question
thus
snowy
gull
if
thou
from
tænarus
be
come
say
hast
thou
there
my
psyche
seen
the
gull
replied
psyche
have
i
seen
walking
beside
the
sea
she
to
bear
a
pyx
of
dark
obsidian
rarest
green
wherein
she
gazeth
on
her
features
fair
she
is
not
hence
by
now
six
miles
at
most
then
eros
bade
him
speed
and
down
the
coast
held
on
his
passage
through
the
buoyant
air
with
eager
eye
he
search
the
salty
marge
boding
all
mischief
from
his
mother
glee
and
wondering
of
her
wiles
and
what
the
charge
shut
in
the
dark
obsidian
pyx
might
be
and
lo
at
last
outstretch
beside
the
rocks
psyche
as
lifeless
and
the
open
box
laid
with
the
weedy
refuse
of
the
sea
he
guess
all
flew
down
and
beside
her
knelt
with
both
his
hands
stroking
her
temples
wan
and
for
the
poison
with
his
fingers
felt
and
drew
it
gently
from
her
and
anon
she
slowly
from
those
stygian
fumes
was
freed
which
he
with
magic
handling
and
good
heed
replaced
in
pyx
and
shut
the
lid
thereon
psyche
thus
and
kissing
her
he
cried
psyche
once
again
hast
thou
thy
foolish
longing
gratified
a
second
time
hath
prying
been
thy
bane
but
lo
i
love
am
come
for
i
am
thine
nor
ever
more
shall
any
fate
malign
or
spite
of
goddess
smite
our
love
in
twain
now
that
i
have
saved
thee
twice
outweigh
the
once
that
i
deserted
thee
and
thou
hast
much
obey
for
once
to
disobey
and
wilt
no
more
my
bidding
disallow
take
up
thy
pyx
to
aphrodite
go
and
claim
the
promise
of
thy
mighty
foe
maybe
that
she
will
grant
it
to
thee
now
she
should
yet
refuse
despair
not
yet
then
psyche
when
she
felt
his
arms
restore
their
old
embrace
and
as
their
bodies
met
knew
the
great
joy
that
grief
is
pardon
for
and
how
it
doth
first
ecstasy
excel
when
love
and
mournèd
well
in
long
days
of
no
hope
comes
home
once
more
but
eros
leaping
up
with
purpose
keen
into
the
air
as
only
love
can
fly
bore
her
to
heaven
and
setting
her
unseen
at
aphrodite
golden
gate
whereby
they
came
as
night
was
close
on
twilight
dim
there
left
and
bidding
her
say
nought
of
him
went
onward
to
the
house
of
zeus
most
high
where
winning
audience
of
the
heavenly
sire
who
well
disposed
to
him
was
used
to
be
he
told
the
story
of
his
strong
desire
and
boldly
begg
that
zeus
would
grant
his
plea
that
he
might
have
sweet
psyche
for
his
wife
and
she
be
dower
with
immortal
life
since
she
was
worthy
by
his
firm
decree
and
great
zeus
smiled
and
at
the
smile
of
zeus
all
heaven
was
glad
and
on
the
earth
below
was
calm
and
peace
awhile
and
sorrow
truce
the
sun
shone
forth
and
smote
the
winter
snow
the
flowërs
sprang
the
birds
gan
sing
and
pair
and
mortals
as
they
drew
the
brighten
air
marvel
and
quite
forgot
their
common
woe
yet
gave
the
thunderer
not
his
full
consent
without
some
words
length
is
come
the
day
thus
spake
he
for
all
thy
youth
misspent
thy
and
thy
wanton
play
thou
art
upgrown
to
taste
the
sweet
and
sour
good
shall
it
work
upon
thee
from
this
hour
look
we
for
better
things
and
this
i
say
since
thy
birth
which
all
we
took
for
bliss
thou
hast
but
mock
us
and
no
less
on
me
hast
brought
disfavour
and
contempt
ywiss
than
others
that
have
had
to
do
with
thee
till
only
such
as
vow
themselves
aloof
from
thee

thine
were

there
were

thus
of
shame
went

punishment
is
shapen
as
reward
is
like
thy

but
our
good
estate
we
honour
while
we
sit
to

adored

thus

alone
of
all
were
there
might
not
rejoice
but
ere
they
sat
to
feast
zeus
bade
them
fill
the
cup
ambrosial
of
immortal
life
and
said
psyche
drink
and
is
my
will
there
is
an
end
of
this
unhappy
strife
nor
can
the
goddess
whose
mislike
had
birth
from
too
great
honour
paid
the
bride
on
earth
forbid
her
any
more
for
eros
wife
then
aphrodite
said
let
it
be
and
psyche
was
brought
in
with
such
a
flush
of
joy
upon
her
face
as
there
to
see
was
fairer
to
love
eye
than
beauty
blush
and
then
she
drank
the
eternal
wine
whose
draught
can
terror
cease
which
flesh
hath
never
quafft
nor
doth
it
flow
from
grape
that
mortals
crush
and
next
stood
eros
forth
and
took
her
hand
and
kisst
her
happy
face
before
them
all
and
zeus
proclaim
them
married
and
from
heaven
whoever
should
that
word
miscall
and
then
all
sat
to
feast
and
one
by
one
pledged
psyche
ere
they
drank
and
cried
done
and
merry
laughter
rang
throughout
the
hall
so
thus
was
eros
unto
psyche
wed
the
heavenly
bridegroom
to
his
earthly
bride
who
won
his
love
in
simple
maidenhead
and
by
her
love
herself
she
glorified
and
him
from
wanton
wildness
disinclined
since
in
his
love
for
her
he
came
to
find
a
joy
unknown
through
all
olympus
wide
and
psyche
for
her
fall
was
quite
forgiven
since
herself
when
tempted
to
rebel
by
others
malice
on
her
ruin
driven
only
of
sweet
simplicity
she
fell
wherein
who
fall
may
fall
unto
the
skies
and
being
foolish
she
was
yet
most
wise
and
took
her
trials
patiently
and
well
and
aphrodite
since
her
full
defeat
is
kinder
and
less
jealous
than
before
and
smiling
on
them
both
calls
psyche
sweet
but
thinks
her
son
less
manly
than
of
yore
though
still
she
holds
his
arm
of
some
renown
when
he
goes
smiting
mortals
up
and
down
piercing
their
marrow
with
his
weapons
sore
now
in
steadfast
love
and
happy
they
hold
for
aye
their
mansion
in
the
sky
and
send
down
heavenly
peace
on
those
who
mate
in
virgin
love
to
find
their
joy
thereby
whom
gently
eros
shooteth
and
apart
keepeth
for
them
from
all
his
sheaf
that
dart
which
psyche
in
his
chamber
pickt
to
try
now
in
that
same
month
psyche
bare
a
child
who
straight
in

was
named

tongues
by

letters

all

i

now
dearly
with
thee
endued
no

in

ponders
her
old
excuse
but
quite
forgets
her
frowns
and
antics
rude
so
kindly
hath
she
grown
to
her
new
use
the
very
names
of
things
belov
are
dear
and
sounds
will
gather
beauty
from
their
sense
as
many
a
face
thro
love
long
residence
groweth
to
fair
instead
of
plain
and
sere
but
when
i
say
thy
name
it
hath
no
peer
and
i
suppose
fortune
determined
thence
her
dower
that
such
beauty
excellence
should
have
a
perfect
title
for
the
ear
thus
may
i
think
the
adopting
muses
chose
their
sons
by
name
knowing
none
would
be
heard
or
writ
so
oft
in
all
the

as
those
dan
chaucer
mighty
shakespeare
then
for
third
the
classic

to
us
arose
shelley
with
liquid
music
in
the
word
the
poets
were
good
teachers
for
they
taught
earth
had
this
joy
but
that
ever
be
that
fortune
should
be
perfected
in
me
my
heart
of
hope
dared
not
engage
the
thought
so
i
stood
low
and
now
but
to
be
caught
by
any
lords
of
the
age
with
thee
vexes
my
modesty
lest
they
should
see
i
hold
them
owls
and
peacocks
things
of
nought
and
when
we
sit
alone
and
as
i
please
i
taste
thy
love
full
smile
and
can
enstate
the
pleasure
of
my
kingly
heart
at
ease
my
thought
swims
like
a
ship
that
with
the
weight
of
her
rich
burden
sleeps
on
the
infinite
seas
becalm
and
can
not
stir
her
golden
freight
while
yet
we
wait
for
spring
and
from
the
dry
and
blackening
east
that
so
embitters
march
must
watch
grey
fields
and
meadows
parch
and
driven
dust
and
withering
snowflake
fly
already
in
glimpses
of
the
tarnish
sky
the
sun
is
warm
and
beckons
to

where
the
covert
hazels
interarch
their
tassell
twigs
fair
beds
of
primrose
lie
beneath
the
crisp
and
wintry
carpet
hid
a
million
buds
but
stay
their
blossoming
and
trustful
birds
have
built
their
nests
amid
the
shuddering
boughs
and
only
wait
to
sing
till
one
soft
shower
from
the
south
shall
bid
and
hither
tempt
the
pilgrim
steps
of
spring
in
thee
my
spring
of
life
hath
bid
the
while
a
rose
unfold
beyond
the
summer
best
the
mystery
of
joy
made
manifest
in
love
and
awakening
smile
whereby
the
lips
in
wonder
reconcile
passion
with
peace
and
show
desire
at
rest
a
grace
of
silence
by
the
greek
unguesst

the
that

hath
fancy
pourtray
above
recorded
oath
of
israel
god
or
light
of
poem
pen
the
very
countenance
of
plighted
troth
heaven
and

where
in
one
moment
blend
the
hope
of
one
and
happiness
of
both
for
beauty
being
the
best
of
all
we
know
sums
up
the
unsearchable
and
secret
aims
of
nature
and
on
joys
whose
earthly
names
were
never
told
can
form
and
sense
bestow
and
man
hath
sped
his
instinct
to
outgo
the
step
of
science
and
against
her
shames
imagination
stakes
out
heavenly
claims
building
a
tower
above
the
head
of
woe
nor
is
there
fairer
work
for
beauty
found
than
that
she
win
in
nature
her
release
from
all
the
woes
that
in
the
world
abound
nay
with
his
sorrow
may
his
love
increase
if
from
man
greater
need
beauty
redound
and
claim
his
tears
for
homage
of
his
peace
thus
to
thy
beauty
doth
my
fond
heart
look
that
late
dismay
her
faithless
faith
forbore
and
wins
again
her
love
lost
in
the
lore
of
schools
and
script
of
many
a
learned
book
for
thou
what
ruthless
death
untimely
took
shalt
now
in
better
brotherhood
restore
and
save
my
batter
ship
that
far
from
shore
high
on
the
dismal
deep
in
tempest
shook
so
in
despite
of
sorrow
lately
i
still
hold
true
to
truth
since
thou
art
true
nor
wail
the
woe
which
thou
to
joy
hast
turn
nor
come
the
heavenly
sun
and
bathing
blue
to
my
life
need
more
splendid
and
than
hath
thy
gift
outmatch
desire
and
due
winter
was
not
unkind
because
uncouth
his
prison
time
made
me
a
closer
guest
and
gave
thy
graciousness
a
warmer
zest
biting
all
else
with
keen
and
angry
tooth
and
bravelier
the
triumphant
blood
of
youth
mantling
thy
cheek
its
happy
home
possest
and
sterner
sport
by
day
put
strength
to
test
and
custom
feast
at
night
gave
tongue
to
truth
or
say
hath
flaunting
summer
a
device
to
match
our
midnight
revelry
that
rang
with
steel
and
flame
along
the
ice
or
when
we
to
nightingales
that
sang
on
dewy
eves
in
spring
did
they
entice
to
gentler
love
than
winter
icy
fang
there
many
a
poet
at
this
hour
rhymes
of
a
love
that
he
hath
never
woo
and
his
lamplit
desk
in
solitude
deems
that
he
sitteth
in
the
muses
bower
and
some
the
flames
of
earthly
love
devour
who
have
taken
no
kiss
of
nature
nor
in
the
world
wilderness
with
heavenly
food
the
sickly
body
of
their
perishing
power
so
none
of
all
our
company
i
boast
but
now
would
mock
my
penning
coud
they
see
how
down
the
right
it
maps
a
jagged
coast
seeing
they
hold
the
manlier
praise
to
be
strong
hand
and
will
and
the
heart
best
when
most
is
sober
simple
true
and
how
coud
i
quarrel
or
blame
you
most
dear
who
all
thy
virtues
gavest
and
kept
back
none
kindness
and
gentleness
truth
without
peer
and
beauty
that
my
fancy
fed
upon
now
not
my
life
contrition
for
my
fault
can
blot
that
day
nor
work
me
recompence
tho
i
might
worthily
thy
worth
exalt
making
thee
long
amends
for
short
offence
for
surely
nowhere
love
if
not
in
thee
are
grace
and
truth
and
beauty
to
be
found
and
all
my
praise
of
these
can
only
be
a
praise
of
thee
by
thee
disown
while
still
thou
must
be
mine
tho
far
removed
and
i
for
one
offence
no
more
beloved
now
since
to
me
altho
by
thee
refused
the
world
is
left
i
shall
find
pleasure
still
the
art
that
most
i
have
loved
but
little
used
will
yield
a
world
of
fancies
at
my
will
and
tho
thou
goest
it
is
from
me
i
where
i
go
thee
in
my
heart
must
bear
and
what
thou
wert
that
wilt
thou
ever
be
my
choice
my
best
my
loved
and
only
fair
farewell
yet
think
not
such
farewell
a
change
from
tenderness
tho
once
to
meet
or
part
but
on
short
absence
so
coud
sense
derange
that
tears
have
graced
the
greeting
of
my
heart
they
were
proud
drops
and
had
my
leave
to
fall
not
on
thy
pity
for
my
pain
to
call
when
sometimes
in
an
ancient
house
where
state
from
noble
ancestry
is
handed
on
we
see
but
desolation
thro
the
gate
and
richest
heirlooms
all
to
ruin
gone
because
maybe
some
fancied
shame
or
fear
bred
of
disease
or
melancholy
fate
hath
driven
the
owner
from
his
rightful
sphere
to
wander
nameless
save
to
pity
or
hate
what
is
the
wreck
of
all
he
hath
in
fief
when
he
that
hath
is
wrecking
nought
is
fine
unto
the
sick
nor
doth
it
burden
grief
that
the
house
perish
when
the

doth

i

in
man
love
all
else
is
nothing
worth
o
flesh
and
blood
comrade
to
tragic
pain
and
clownish
merriment
whose
sense
could
wake
sermons
in
stones
and
count
death
but
an
ache
all
things
as
vanity
yet
nothing
vain
the
world
set
in
thy
heart
thy
passionate
strain
reveal
anew
but
thou
for
man
didst
make
nature
twice
natural
only
to
shake
her
kingdom
with
the
creatures
of
thy
brain
lo
shakespeare
since
thy
time
nature
is
loth
to
yield
to
art
her
fair
supremacy
in
conquering
one
thou
hast
so
enrichèd
both
what
shall
i
say
for
god
whose
wise
decree
confirmeth
all
he
did
by
all
he
doth
doubled
his
whole
creation
making
thee
i
would
be
a
bird
and
straight
on
wings
i
arise
and
carry
purpose
up
to
the
ends
of
the
air
in
calm
and
storm
my
sails
i
feather
and
where
by
freezing
cliffs
the
unransom
wreckage
lies
or
strutting
on
hot
meridian
banks
surprise
the
silence
over
plains
in
the
moonlight
bare
i
chase
my
shadow
and
perch
where
no
bird
dare
in
treetops
torn
by
fiercest
winds
of
the
skies
poor
simple
birds
foolish
birds
then
i
cry
ye
pretty
pictures
of
delight
by
the
only
joy
of
knowing
that
ye
fly
ye
are
nót
what
ye
are
but
rather
sum
in
a
word
the
alphabet
of
a
god
idea
and
i
who
master
it
i
am
the
only
bird
o
weary
pilgrims
chanting
of
your
woe
that
turn
your
eyes
to
all
the
peaks
that
shine
hailing
in
each
the
citadel
divine
the
which
ye
thought
to
have
enter
long
ago
until
at
length
your
feeble
steps
and
slow
falter
upon
the
threshold
of
the
shrine
and
your
hearts
overburden
doubt
in
fine
whether
it
be
jerusalem
or
no
dishearten
pilgrims
i
am
one
of
you
for
having
worshipp
many
a
barren
face
i
scarce
now
greet
the
goal
i
journey
to
i
stand
a
pagan
in
the
holy
place
beneath
the
lamp
of
truth
i
am
found
untrue
and
question
with
the
god
that
i
embrace
spring
hath
her
own
bright
days
of
calm
and
peace
her
melting
air
at
every
breath
we
draw
floods
heart
with
love
to
praise
god
gracious
law
but
suddenly
so
short
is
pleasure
lease
the
cold
returns
the
buds
from
growing
cease
and
nature
conquer
face
is
full
of
awe
as
now
the
north
with
icy
flaw
freezes
the
dew
upon
the
sick
lamb
fleece
and
the
mock
sun
searching
everywhere
rattles
the
crispèd
leaves
with
shivering
din
so
that
the
birds
are
silent
with
despair
within
the
thickets
nor
their
armour
thin
will
gaudy
flies
adventure
in
the
air
nor
any
lizard
sun
his
spotted
skin
nothing
is
joy
without
thee
i
can
find
no
rapture
in
the
first
relays
of
spring
in
songs
of
birds
in
young
buds
opening
nothing
inspiriting
and
nothing
kind
for
lack
of
thee
who
once
wert
throned
behind
all
beauty
like
a
strength
where
graces
cling
the
jewel
and
heart
of
light
which
everything
wrestled
in
rivalry
to
hold
enshrined
ah
since
fled
and
i
in
each
fair
sight
the
sweet
occasion
of
my
joy
deplore
where
shall
i
seek
thee
best
or
whom
invite
within
thy
sacred
temples
and
adore
who
shall
fill
thought
and
truth
with
old
delight
and
lead
my
soul
in
life
as
heretofore
the
work
is
done
and
from
the
fingers
fall
the
bloodwarm
tools
that
brought
the
labour
thro
the
tasking
eye
that
overrunneth
all
rests
and
affirms
there
is
no
more
to
do
now
the
third
joy
of
making
the
sweet
flower
of
blessed
work
bloometh
in
godlike
spirit
which
whoso
plucketh
holdeth
for
an
hour
the
shrivelling
vanity
of
mortal
merit
and
thou
my
perfect
work
of
a
poor
and
alien
thing
wilt
be
true
only
should
the
swift
life
stand
at
stay
therefore
farewell
nor
look
to
bide
with
me
go
find
thy
friends
if
there
be
one
to
love
thee
casting
thee
forth
my
child
i
rise
above
thee
the
fabled
old
leviathan
or
else
what
grisly
beast
of
scaly
chine
that
champ
the
and
swash
the
brine
before
the
new
and
milder
days
of
man
had
never
rib
nor
bray
nor
swindging
fan
like
his
iron
swimmer
of
the
clyde
or
tyne
of
golden
seed
to
breed
a
line
of
offspring
swifter
and
more
huge
of
plan
straight
is
her
going
for
upon
the
sun
when
once
she
hath
look
her
path
and
place
are
plain
with
tireless
speed
she
smiteth
one
by
one
the
shuddering
seas
and
foams
along
the
main
and
her
eased
breath
when
her
wild
race
is
run
roars
thro
her
nostrils
like
a
hurricane
a
thousand
times
hath
in
my
heart
behoof
my
tongue
been
set
his
passion
to
impart
a
thousand
times
hath
my
too
coward
heart
my
mouth
reclosed
and
fix
it
to
the
roof
then
with
such
cunning
hath
it
held
aloof
a
thousand
times
kept
silence
with
such
art
that
words
coud
do
no
more
yet
on
thy
part
hath
silence
given
a
thousand
times
reproof
i
should
be
bolder
seeing
i
commend
love
that
my
dilatory
purpose
primes
but
fear
lest
with
my
fears
my
hope
should
end
nay
i
would
truth
deny
and
burn
my
rhymes
renew
my
sorrows
rather
than
offend
a
thousand
times
and
yet
a
thousand
times
i
travel
to
thee
with
the
sun
first
rays
that
lift
the
dark
west
and
unwrap
the
night
i
dwell
beside
thee
when
he
walks
the
height
and
fondly
toward
thee
at
his
setting
gaze
i
wait
upon
thy
coming
but
always
dancing
to
meet
my
thoughts
if
they
invite
thou
hast
outrun
their
longing
with
delight
and
in
my
solitude
dost
mock
my
praise
now
doth
my
drop
of
time
transcend
the
whole
i
see
no
fame
in
khufu
pyramid
no
history
where
loveless
nile
doth
roll
this
is
eternal
life
which
doth
forbid
mortal
detraction
to
the
exalted
soul
and
from
her
inward
eye
all
fate
hath
hid
my
lady
pleases
me
and
i
please
her
this
know
we
both
and
i
besides
know
well
wherefore
i
love
her
and
i
love
to
tell
my
love
as
all
my
loving
songs
aver
but
what
on
her
part
could
the
passion
stir
tho
is
more
difficult
for
love
to
spell
yet
can
i
dare
divine
how
this
befel
nor
will
her
lips
deny
it
if
i
err
she
loves
me
first
because
i
love
her
then
loves
me
for
knowing
why
she
should
be
loved
and
that
i
love
to
praise
her
loves
again
so
from
her
beauty
both
our
loves
are
moved
and
by
her
beauty
are
sustain
nor
when
the
earth
falls
from
the
sun
is
this
disproved
in
all
things
beautiful
i
can
not
see
her
sit
or
stand
but
love
is
stir
anew
is
joy
to
watch
the
folds
fall
as
they
do
and
all
that
comes
is
past
expectancy
if
she
be
silent
silence
let
it
be
he
who
would
bid
her
speak
might
sit
and
sue
the
phidian
jove
to
be
untrue
to
his
two
thousand
years
solemnity
ah
but
her
launchèd
passion
when
she
sings
wins
on
the
hearing
like
a
shapen
prow
borne
by
the
mastery
of
its
urgent
wings
or
if
she
deign
her
wisdom
she
doth
show
she
hath
the
intelligence
of
heavenly
things
unsullied
by
man
mortal
overthrow
thus
to
be
humbled
is
that
ranging
pride
no
refuge
hath
that
in
his
castle
strong
brave
reason
sits
beleaguer
who
so
long
kept
field
but
now
must
starve
where
he
doth
hide
that
industry
who
once
the
foe
defied
lies
slaughter
in
the
trenches
that
the
throng
of
idle
fancies
pipe
their
foolish
song
where
late
the
puissant
captains
fought
and
died
thus
to
be
humbled
is
to
be
undone
a
forest
fell
a
city
razed
to
ground
a
cloak
unsewn
unwoven
and
unspun
till
not
a
thread
remains
that
can
be
wound
and
yet
o
lover
thee
the
ruin
one
love
who
hath
humbled
thus
hath
also
crown
i
care
not
if
i
live
tho
life
and
breath
have
never
been
to
me
so
dear
and
sweet
i
care
not
if
i
die
for
i
coud
meet
being
so
happy
happily
my
death
i
care
not
if
i
love
she
saith
she
loveth
and
love
history
is
complete
nor
care
i
if
she
love
me
at
her
feet
my
spirit
bows
entranced
and
worshippeth
i
have
no
care
for
what
was
most
my
care
but
all
around
me
see
fresh
beauty
born
and
common
sights
grown
lovelier
than
they
were
i
dream
of
love
and
in
the
light
of
morn
tremble
beholding
all
things
very
fair
and
strong
with
strength
that
puts
my
strength
to
scorn
my
goddess
sometimes
i
say
now
let
this
word
for
ever
and
all
suffice
thou
art
insatiable
and
yet
not
twice
can
even
thy
lover
give
his
soul
away
and
for
my
acts
that
at
thy
feet
i
lay
for
never
any
other
by
device
of
wisdom
love
or
beauty
could
entice
my
homage
to
the
measure
of
this
day
i
have
no
more
to
give
thee
lo
i
have
sold
my
life
have
emptied
out
my
heart
and
spent
i
had
till
like
a
beggar
bold
with
nought
to
lose
i
laugh
and
am
content
a
beggar
kisses
thee
nay
love
behold
i
fear
not
thou
too
art
in
beggarment
all
earthly
beauty
hath
one
cause
and
proof
to
lead
the
pilgrim
soul
to
beauty
above
yet
lieth
the
greater
bliss
so
far
aloof
that
few
there
be
are
wean
from
earthly
love
joy
ladder
it
is
reaching
from
home
to
home
the
best
of
all
the
work
that
all
was
good
whereof
was
writ
the
angels
aye
upclomb
down
sped
and
at
the
top
the
lord
god
stood
but
i
my
time
abuse
my
eyes
by
day
center
on
thee
by
night
my
heart
on
fire
letting
my
number
moments
run
away
nor
night
and
day
to
heaven
aspire
so
true
it
is
that
what
the
eye
seeth
not
but
slow
is
loved
and
loved
is
soon
forgot
o
my
life
mischief
once
my
love
delight
that
a
mortgage
on
my
heart
estate
whose
baneful
clause
is
never
out
of
date
nor
can
avenging
time
restore
my
right
whom
first
to
lose
sounded
that
note
of
spite
whereto
my
doleful
days
were
tuned
by
fate
that
art
the
cause
of
all
my
hate
the
sun
whose
wandering
makes
my
hopeless
night
thou
being
in
all
my
lacking
all
i
lack
it
is
thy
goodness
turns
my
grace
to
crime
thy
fleetness
from
my
goal
which
holds
me
back
wherefore
my
feet
go
out
of
step
with
time
my
very
grasp
of
life
is
old
and
slack
and
even
my
passion
falters
in
my
rhyme
at
times
with
hurried
hoofs
and
scattering
dust
i
race
by
field
or
highway
and
my
horse
spare
not
but
urge
direct
in
headlong
course
unto
some
fair
far
hill
that
gain
i
must
but
near
arrived
the
vision
soon
mistrust
rein
in
and
stand
as
one
who
sees
the
source
of
strong
illusion
shaming
thought
to
force
from
off
his
mind
the
soil
of
passion
gust
my
brow
i
bare
then
and
with
slacken
speed
can
view
the
country
pleasant
on
all
sides
and
to
kind
salutation
give
good
heed
i
ride
as
one
who
for
his
pleasure
rides
and
stroke
the
neck
of
my
delighted
steed
and
seek
what
cheer
the
village
inn
provides
an
idle
june
day
on
the
sunny
thames
floating
or
rowing
as
our
fancy
led
now
in
the
high
beams
basking
as
we
sped
now
in
green
shade
gliding
by
mirror
stems
by
lock
and
weir
and
isle
and
many
a
spot
of
memoried
pleasure
glad
with
strength
and
skill
friendship
good
wine
and
mirth
that
serve
not
ill
the
heavenly
muse
tho
she
requite
them
not
i
would
have
life
thou
saidst
all
as
this
day
simple
enjoyment
calm
in
its
excess
with
not
a
grief
to
cloud
and
not
a
ray
of
passion
overhot
my
peace
to
oppress
with
no
ambition
to
reproach
delay
nor
rapture
to
disturb
its
happiness
a
man
that
sees
by
chance
his
picture
made
as
once
a
child
he
was
handling
some
toy
will
gaze
to
find
his
spirit
within
the
boy
yet
hath
no
secret
with
the
soul
pourtray
he
can
not
think
the
simple
thought
which
upon
those
features
then
so
frank
and
coy
is
his
yet
oh
not
his
and
the
joy
his
fatherly
pity
bends
in
tears
dismay
proud
of
his
prime
maybe
he
stand
at
best
and
lightly
wear
his
strength
or
aim
it
high
in
knowledge
skill
and
courage
yet
in
the
pictured
face
a
charm
doth
lie
the
one
thing
lost
more
worth
than
all
the
rest
which
seeing
he
fears
to
say
child
was
tears
of
love
tears
of
joy
and
tears
of
care
comforting
tears
that
fell
uncomforted
tears
the
tears
beside
the
dead
tears
of
hope
pride
and
pity
trust
and
prayer
tears
of
contrition
all
tears
of
tenderness
or
kindness
had
she
shed
who
here
is
pictured
ere
upon
her
head
the
fine
gold
might
be
turn
to
silver
there
the
smile
that
charm
the
father
hath
given
place
unto
the
furrow
care
wrought
by
the
son
but
virtue
hath
transform
all
change
to
grace
so
that
i
praise
the
artist
who
hath
done
a
portrait
for
my
worship
of
the
face
won
by
the
heart
my
father
heart
that
won
if
i
coud
but
forget
and
not
recall
so
well
my
time
of
pleasure
and
of
play
when
ancient
nature
was
all
new
and
gay
light
as
the
fashion
that
doth
last
enthrall
ah
mighty
nature
when
my
heart
was
small
nor
dream
what
fearful
searchings
underlay
the
flowers
and
leafy
ecstasy
of
may
the
breathing
summer
sloth
the
scented
fall
coud
i
forget
then
were
the
fight
not
hard
press
in
the
mêlée
of
accursed
things
having
such
help
in
love
and
such
reward
but
that
is
i
who
once
is
this
that
stings
once
dwelt
within
the
gate
that
angels
guard
where
yet
i
be
had
i
but
heavenly
wings
when
i
see
childhood
on
the
threshold
seize
the
prize
of
life
from
age
and
likelihood
i
mourn
time
change
that
will
not
be
withstood
thinking
how
christ
said
like
one
of
for
in
the
forest
among
many
trees
scarce
one
in
all
is
found
that
hath
made
good
the
virgin
pattern
of
its
slender
wood
that
courtesied
in
joy
to
every
breeze
but
scath
but
knotted
trunks
that
raise
on
high
their
arms
in
stiff
contortion
strain
and
bare
whose
patriarchal
crowns
in
sorrow
sigh
so
little
children
ye
nay
nay
ye
from
me
shall
learn
how
sure
the
change
and
nigh
when
ye
shall
share
our
strength
and
mourn
to
share
when
parch
with
thirst
astray
on
sultry
sand
the
traveller
faints
upon
his
closing
ear
steals
a
fantastic
music
he
may
hear
the
babbling
fountain
of
his
native
land
before
his
eyes
the
vision
seems
to
stand
where
at
its
terraced
brink
the
maids
appear
who
fill
their
deep
urns
at
its
waters
clear
and
not
refuse
the
help
of
lover
hand
o
cruel
jest
he
cries
as
some
one
flings
the
sparkling
drops
in
sport
or
shew
of
ire
o
shameless
o
contempt
of
holy
things
but
never
of
their
wanton
play
they
tire
as
not
athirst
they
sit
beside
the
springs
while
he
must
quench
in
death
his
lost
desire
the
image
of
thy
love
rising
on
dark
and
desperate
days
over
my
sullen
sea
wakens
again
fresh
hope
and
peace
in
me
gleaming
above
upon
my
groaning
bark
my
sorrow
be
i
then
may
hark
a
loving
voice
my
terror
be
this
heavenly
comfort
still
i
win
from
thee
to
shine
my
lodestar
that
wert
once
my
mark
prodigal
nature
makes
us
but
to
taste
one
perfect
joy
which
given
she
niggard
grows
and
lest
her
precious
gift
should
run
to
waste
adds
to
its
loss
a
thousand
lesser
woes
so
to
the
memory
of
the
gift
that
graced
her
hand
her
graceless
hand
more
grace
bestows
in
this
neglected
ruin
edifice
of
works
unperfected
and
broken
schemes
where
is
the
promise
of
my
early
dreams
the
smile
of
beauty
and
the
pearl
of
price
no
charm
is
left
now
that
could
once
entice
fortune
from
her
golden
streams
and
full
in
flight
decrepit
purpose
seems
trailing
the
banner
of
his
old
device
within
the
house
a
frore
and
numbing
air
has
chill
endeavour
sickly
memories
reign
in
every
room
and
ghosts
are
on
the
stair
and
hope
behind
the
dusty
watches
the
days
go
by
and
bow
with
care
forecasts
her
last
reproach
and
mortal
stain
once
i
would
say
before
thy
vision
came
and
with
some
kind
of
knowledge
speak
and
think
i
knew
my
mind
of
heaven
and
hope
and
each
word
hit
its
aim
their
sounds
be
now
all
mean
the
same
denoting
each
the
fair
that
none
can
find
or
if
i
say
them
is
as
one
long
blind
forgets
the
sights
that
he
was
used
to
name
now
if
men
speak
of
love
is
not
my
love
nor
are
their
hopes
nor
joys
mine
nor
their
life
of
praise
the
life
that
i
think
honour
of
nay
tho
they
turn
from
house
and
child
and
wife
and
self
and
in
the
thought
of
heaven
above
hold
as
do
i
all
mortal
things
at
strife
since
then
is
only
pity
looking
back
fear
looking
forward
and
the
busy
mind
will
in
one
woeful
moment
more
upwind
than
lifelong
years
unroll
of
bitter
or
black
what
is
man
privilege
his
hoarding
knack
of
memory
with
foreboding
so
combined
whereby
he
comes
to
dream
he
hath
of
kind
the
perpetuity
which
all
things
lack
which
but
to
hope
is
doubtful
joy
to
have
being
a
continuance
of
what
alas
we
mourn
and
scarcely
bear
with
to
the
grave
or
something
so
unknown
that
it
the
thought
of
comfort
and
the
sense
that
gave
can
not
consider
it
thro
any
glass
come
gentle
sleep
i
woo
thee
come
and
take
not
now
the
child
into
thine
arms
from
fright
composed
by
drowsy
tune
and
shaded
light
whom
ignorant
of
thee
thou
didst
nurse
and
make
nor
now
the
boy
who
scorn
thee
for
the
sake
of
growing
knowledge
or
mysterious
night
tho
with
fatigue
thou
didst
his
limbs
invite
and
heavily
weigh
the
eyes
that
would
not
wake
no
nor
the
man
severe
who
from
his
best
failing
alert
fled
to
thee
that
his
breath
blood
force
and
fire
should
come
at
morn

me
from
whom
thy
comfort
tarrieth

like
a
child
at
any
toy
will
pull
if
sorrow
he
will
weep
for
fancy
sake
and
spoil
heaven

with
forbidden
care
what

how
with

so
worn
and
bare
look
ye
for
any

earth
should
others
ask
you
this
say
then
i
to
write
you
such
as
once
when
i
was
young
finding
i
should
have
loved
and
thereto
turn
something
yet
to
live
again
among
the
gentle
youth
beloved
and
where
i
my
art
be
there
remember
for
my
song
who
takes
the
census
of
the
living
dead
ere
the
day
come
when
memory
shall
the
kingdom
of
their
fame

for
that
proud
and
airy
people
find
no
room
nor
stead
ere
hoarding
time
that
ever
thrusteth
back
the
fairest
treasures
of
his
ancient
store
better
with
best
confound
so
he
may
pack
his
greedy
gatherings
closer
more
and
more
let
the
true
muse
rewrite
her
sullied
page
and
purge
her
story
of
the
men
of
hate
that
they
go
dirgeless
down
to
satan
rage
with
all
else
foul
deform
and
miscreate
she
hath
full
toil
to
keep
the
names
of
love
honour
on
earth
as
they
are
bright
above
i
heard
great
hector
sounding
war
alarms
where
thro
the
listless
ghosts
chiding
he
strode
as
tho
the
greeks
besieged
his
last
abode
and
he
his
troy
hope
still
her
but
on
those
gentle
meads
which
lethe
charms
with
weary
oblivion
his
passion
like
the
cold
candle
and
only
such
mimic
flame
as
neither
heats
nor
harms
was
plain
to
read
even
by
those
shadows
quaint
how
rude
catastrophe
had
dim
his
day
and
blighted
all
his
cheer
with
stern
complaint
arms
to
arms
what
more
the
voice
would
say
was
swallow
in
the
valleys
and
grew
faint
upon
the
thin
air
as
he
pass
away
since
not
the
enamour
sun
with
glance
more
fond
kisses
the
foliage
of
his
sacred
tree
than
doth
my
waking
thought
arise
on
thee
loving
none
near
thee
like
thee
nor
beyond
nay
since
i
am
sworn
thy
slave
and
in
the
bond
is
writ
my
promise
of
eternity
since
to
such
high
hope
encouraged
me
that
if
thou
look
but
from
me
i
despond
since
my
all
in
all
o
think
of
this
think
of
the
dedication
of
my
youth
think
of
my
loyalty
my
joy
my
bliss
think
of
my
sorrow
my
despair
and
ruth
my
sheer
annihilation
if
i
miss
think
if
thou
shouldst
be
false
think
of
thy
truth
these
meagre
rhymes
which
a
returning
mood
sometimes
i
as
oft
despise
and
knowing
them
illnatured
stiff
and
rude
see
them
as
others
with
contemptuous
eyes
nay
and
i
wonder
less
at
god
respect
for
man
a
minim
jot
in
time
and
space
than
at
the
soaring
faith
of
his
elect
that
gift
of
gifts
the
comfort
of
his
grace
o
truth
unsearchable
o
heavenly
love
most
infinitely
tender
so
to
touch
the
work
that
we
can
meanly
reckon
of
surely
i
say
we
are
favour
overmuch
but
of
this
wonder
what
doth
most
amaze
is
that
we
know
our
love
is
held
for
praise
beauty
sat
with
me
all
the
summer
day
awaiting
the
sure
triumph
of
her
eye
nor
mark
i
till
we
parted
how
hard
by
love
in
her
train
stood
ready
for
his
prey
she
as
too
proud
to
join
herself
the
fray
trusting
too
much
to
her
divine
ally
when
she
saw
victory
tarry
chid
him
dost
thou
not
at
one
stroke
this
rebel
slay
then
generous
love
who
holds
my
heart
in
fee
told
of
our
ancient
truce
so
from
the
fight
we
straight
withdrew
our
forces
all
the
three
baffled
but
not
dishearten
she
took
flight
scheming
new
tactics
love
came
home
with
me
and
prompts
my
measured
verses
as
i
write
in
autumn
moonlight
when
the
white
air
wan
is
fragrant
in
the
wake
of
summer
hence
is
sweet
to
sit
entranced
and
muse
thereon
in
melancholy
and
godlike
indolence
when
the
proud
spirit
lull
by
mortal
prime
to
fond
pretence
of
immortality
vieweth
all
moments
from
the
birth
of
time
all
things
have
been
or
yet
shall
be
and
like
the
garden
where
the
year
is
spent
the
ruin
of
old
life
is
full
of
yearning
mingling
poetic
rapture
of
lament
with
flowers
and
sunshine
of
spring
sure
returning
only
in
visions
of
the
white
air
wan
by
godlike
fancy
seized
and
dwelt
upon
when
first
i
saw
thee
dearest
if
i
say
the
spells
that
conjure
back
the
hour
and
place
and
evermore
i
look
upon
thy
face
as
in
the
spring
of
years
long
pass
away
no
fading
of
thy
beauty
rich
array
no
detriment
of
age
on
thee
i
trace
but
time
defeat
written
in
spoils
of
grace
from
rivals
robb
whom
thou
didst
pity
and
slay
so
hath
thy
growth
been
thus
thy
faith
is
true
unchanged
in
change
still
to
my
growing
sense
to
life
desire
the
same
and
nothing
new
but
as
thou
wert
in
dream
and
prescience
at
love
arising
now
thou
to
view
in
the
broad
noon
of
his
magnificence
was
on
the
very
day
winter
took
leave
of
those
fair
fields
i
love
when
to
the
skies
the
fragrant
earth
was
smiling
in
surprise
at
that
her
quick
reprieve
i
wander
forth
my
sorrow
to
relieve
yet
walk
amid
sweet
pleasure
in
such
wise
as
adam
went
alone
in
paradise
before
god
of
his
pity
fashion
eve
and
out
of
tune
with
all
the
joy
around
i
laid
me
down
beneath
a
flowering
tree
and
my
senses
crept
a
sleep
profound
in
which
it
seem
that
thou
wert
given
to
me
rending
my
body
where
with
hurried
sound
i
feel
my
heart
beat
when
i
think
of
thee
love
that
i
know
love
i
am
wise
in
love
my
strength
my
pride
my
grace
my
skill
untaught
my
faith
here
upon
earth
my
hope
above
my
contemplation
and
perpetual
thought
the
pleasure
of
my
fancy
my
heart
fire
my
joy
my
peace
my
praise
my
happy
theme
the
aim
of
all
my
doing
my
desire
of
being
my
life
by
day
by
night
my
dream
love
my
sweet
melancholy
my
distress
my
pain
my
doubt
my
trouble
my
despair
my
only
folly
and
unhappiness
and
in
my
careless
moments
still
my
care
o
love
sweet
love
earthly
love
love
divine
thou
o
love
that
thou
art
mine
the
dark
and
serious
angel
who
so
long
vex
his
immortal
strength
in
charge
of
me
hath
smiled
for
joy
and
fled
in
liberty
to
take
his
pastime
with
the
peerless
throng
oft
had
i
done
his
noble
keeping
wrong
wounding
his
heart
to
wonder
what
might
be
god
purpose
in
a
soul
of
such
degree
and
there
he
had
left
me
but
for
mandate
strong
but
seeing
thee
with
me
now
his
task
at
close
he
knoweth
and
wherefore
he
was
bid
to
stay
and
work
confusion
of
so
many
foes
the
thanks
that
he
doth
look
for
here
i
pay
yet
fear
some
heavenly
envy
as
he
goes
unto
what
great
reward
i
can
not
say
i
will
be
what
god
made
me
nor
protest
against
the
bent
of
genius
in
my
time
that
science
of
my
friends
robs
all
the
best
while
i
love
beauty
and
was
born
to
rhyme
be
they
our
mighty
men
and
let
me
dwell
in
shadow
among
the
mighty
shades
of
old
with
love
forsaken
palace
for
my
cell
whence
i
look
forth
and
all
the
world
behold
and
say
these
better
days
in
best
things
worse
this
bastardy
of
time
magnificence
will
mend
in
fashion
and
throw
off
the
curse
to
crown
new
love
with
higher
excellence
curs
tho
i
be
to
live
my
life
alone
my
toil
is
for
man
joy
his
joy
my
own
i
live
on
hope
and
that
i
think
do
all
who
come
into
this
world
and
since
i
see
myself
in
swim
with
such
good
company
i
take
my
comfort
befall
i
abide
and
abide
as
if
more
stout
and
tall
my
spirit
would
grow
by
waiting
like
a
tree
and
clear
of

it
pleaseth
me
in
dreams
their
quick
ambition
to
forestall
and
if
thro
careless
eagerness
i
slide
to
some
accomplishment
i
give
my
voice
still
to

itself

thousand
painful
days

there
lives
beyond

kindest
phase
the

is

the

writ

gloweth
in

hell
my
wearied
heart
whenever
after
all
its
loves
and

shall
be
told
complete
when
gentle
death
shall
bid
it
cease
to
beat
and
from
all
dear
illusions
disenthrall
however
then
thou
shalt
appear
to
call
my
fearful
heart
since
down
at
others
feet
it
bade
me
kneel
so
oft
i
not
retreat
from
thee
nor
fear
before
thy
feet
to
fall
and
i
shall
say
this
loving
heart
which
err
in
sorrow
only
and
in
sin
took
no
delight
but
being
forced
apart
from
thee
without
thee
hoping
thee
to
win
most
prized
what
most
thou
madest
as
thou
art
on
earth
till
heaven
were
open
to
enter
in
dreary
was
winter
wet
with
changeful
sting
of
clinging
snowfall
and
frost
and
bitterer
northwinds
then
withheld
the
spring
that
dallied
with
her
promise
till
was
lost
a
sunless
and
summer
the
flowers
in
needful
and
unwelcom
rain
and
autumn
with
a
sad
smile
fled
from
fruitless
orchards

desolate

to
elegy
clear
and
gentle
stream
known
and
loved
so
long
that
hast
heard
the
song
and
the
idle
dream
of
my
boyish
day
while
i
once
again
down
thy
margin
stray
in
the
selfsame
strain
still
my
voice
is
spent
with
my
old
lament
and
my
idle
dream
clear
and
gentle
stream
where
my
old
seat
was
here
again
i
sit
where
the
long
boughs
knit
over
stream
and
grass
a
translucent
eaves
where
back
eddies
play
shipwreck
with
the
leaves
and
the
proud
swans
stray
sailing
one
by
one
out
of
stream
and
sun
and
the
fish
lie
cool
in
their
chosen
pool
many
an
afternoon
of
the
summer
day
dreaming
here
i
lay
and
i
know
how
soon
idly
at
its
hour
first
the
deep
bell
hums
from
the
minster
tower
and
then
evening
comes
creeping
up
the
glade
with
her
lengthening
shade
and
the
tardy
boon
of
her
brightening
moon
clear
and
gentle
stream
ere
again
i
go
where
thou
dost
not
flow
well
does
it
beseem
thee
to
hear
again
once
my
youthful
song
that
familiar
strain
silent
now
so
long
be
as
i
content
with
my
old
lament
and
my
idle
dream
clear
and
gentle
stream
elegy
the
wood
is
bare
a
is
steeping
the
trees
that
winter
chill
of
life
bereaves
only
their
stiffened
boughs
break
silence
weeping
over
their
fallen
leaves
that
lie
upon
the
dank
earth
brown
and
rotten
miry
and
matted
in
the
soaking
wet
forgotten
with
the
spring
that
is
forgotten
by
them
that
can
forget
yet
it
was
here
we
walked
when
ferns
were
springing
and
through
the
mossy
bank
shot
bud
and
blade
here
found
in
summer
when
the
birds
were
singing
a
green
and
pleasant
shade
was
here
we
loved
in
sunnier
days
and
greener
and
now
in
this
disconsolate
decay
i
come
to
see
her
where
i
most
have
seen
her
and
touch
the
happier
day
for
on
this
path
at
every
turn
and
corner
the
fancy
of
her
figure
on
me
falls
yet
walks
she
with
the
slow
step
of
a
mourner
nor
hears
my
voice
that
calls
so
through
my
heart
there
winds
a
track
of
feeling
a
path
of
memory
that
is
all
her
own
whereto
her
phantom
beauty
ever
stealing
haunts
the
sad
spot
alone
about
her
steps
the
trunks
are
bare
the
branches
drip
heavy
tears
upon
her
downcast
head
and
bleed
from
unseen
wounds
that
no
sun
stanches
for
the
year
sun
is
dead
and
dead
leaves
wrap
the
fruits
that
summer
planted
and
birds
that
love
the
south
have
taken
wing
the
wanderer
loitering
the
scene
enchanted
weeps
and
despairs
of
spring
poor
withered
rose
and
dry
skeleton
of
a
rose
risen
to
testify
to
love
sad
close
treasured
for
love
sweet
sake
that
of
joy
past
thou
again
awake
memory
at
last
yet
is
thy
perfume
sweet
thy
petals
red
yet
tell
of
summer
heat
and
the
gay
bed
yet
yet
recall
the
glow
of
the
gazing
sun
when
at
thy
bush
we
two
joined
hands
in
one
but
rose
thou
hast
not
seen
thou
hast
not
wept
the
change
that
passed
between
whilst
thou
hast
slept
to
me
thou
seemest
yet
the
dead
dream
thrall
while
i
live
and
forget
dream
truth
and
all
thou
art
more
fresh
than
i
rose
sweet
and
red
salt
on
my
pale
cheeks
lie
the
tears
i
shed
the
the
has
a
carpet
of
lilac
gold
and
green
the
blue
sky
bounds
the
ocean
the
white
clouds
scud
between
a
flock
of
gulls
are
wheeling
and
wailing
round
my
seat
above
my
head
the
heaven
the
sea
beneath
my
feet
the
ocean
were
i
a
cloud
i
gather
my
skirts
up
in
the
air
and
fly
i
well
know
whither
and
rest
i
well
know
where
as
pointed
the
star
surely
the
legend
tells
of
old
where
the
wise
kings
might
offer
myrrh
frankincense
and
gold
above
the
house
i
hover
where
dwells
my
love
and
wait
till
haply
i
might
spy
her
throw
back
the
there
in
the
summer
evening
i
would
bedeck
the
moon
i
would
float
down
and
screen
her
from
the
sun
rays
at
noon
and
if
her
flowers
should
languish
or
wither
in
the
drought
upon
her
tall
white
lilies
i
pour
my
heart
blood
out
so
if
she
wore
one
only
and
shook
not
out
the
rain
were
i
a
cloud
o
cloudlet
i
had
not
lived
in
vain
cloud
a
cloud
but
were
i
thou
o
ocean
i
would
not
chafe
and
fret
as
thou
because
a
limit
to
thy
desires
is
set
i
would
be
blue
and
gentle
patient
and
calm
and
see
if
my
smiles
might
not
tempt
her
my
love
to
come
to
me
i
make
my
depths
transparent
and
still
that
she
should
lean
the
boat
edge
to
ponder
the
sights
that
swam
between
i
would
command
strange
creatures
of
bright
hue
and
quick
fin
to
stir
the
water
near
her
and
tempt
her
bare
arm
in
i
teach
her
spend
the
summer
with
me
and
i
can
tell
that
were
i
thou
o
ocean
my
love
should
love
me
well
but
on
the
mad
cloud
scudded
the
breeze
it
blew
so
stiff
and
the
sad
ocean
bellowed
and
pounded
at
the
cliff
i
heard
a
linnet
courting
his
lady
in
the
spring
his
mates
were
idly
sporting
nor
stayed
to
hear
him
sing
his
song
of
i
fear
my
speech
distorting
his
tender
love
the
phrases
of
his
pleading
were
full
of
young
delight
and
she
that
gave
him
heeding
interpreted
aright
his
gay
sweet
notes
so
sadly
marred
in
the
reading
his
tender
notes
and
when
he
ceased
the
hearer
awaited
the
refrain
till
swiftly
perching
nearer
he
sang
his
song
again
his
pretty
song
would
that
my
verse
spake
clearer
his
tender
song
ye
happy
airy
creatures
that
in
the
merry
spring
think
not
of
what
misfeatures
or
cares
the
year
may
bring
but
unto
love
resign
your
simple
natures
to
tender
love
dear
lady
when
thou
frownest
and
my
true
love
despisest
and
all
thy
vows
disownest
that
sealed
my
venture
wisest
i
think
thy
pride
displeasure
neglects
a
matchless
treasure
exceeding
price
and
measure
but
when
again
thou
smilest
and
love
for
love
returnest
and
fear
with
joy
beguilest
and
takest
truth
in
earnest
then
though
i
sheer
adore
thee
the
sum
of
my
love
for
thee
seems
poor
scant
and
unworthy
i
will
not
let
thee
go
ends
all
our
love
in
this
can
it
be
summed
up
so
quit
in
a
single
kiss
i
will
not
let
thee
go
i
will
not
let
thee
go
if
thy
words
breath
could
scare
thy
deeds
as
the
soft
south
can
blow
and
toss
the
feathered
seeds
then
might
i
let
thee
go
i
will
not
let
thee
go
had
not
the
great
sun
seen
i
might
or
were
he
reckoned
slow
to
bring
the
false
to
light
then
might
i
let
thee
go
i
will
not
let
thee
go
the
stars
that
crowd
the
summer
skies
have
watched
us
so
below
with
all
their
million
eyes
i
dare
not
let
thee
go
i
will
not
let
thee
go
have
we
not
chid
the
changeful
moon
now
rising
late
and
now
because
she
set
too
soon
and
shall
i
let
thee
go
i
will
not
let
thee
go
have
not
the
young
flowers
been
content
plucked
ere
their
buds
could
blow
to
seal
our
sacrament
i
can
not
let
thee
go
i
will
not
let
thee
go
i
hold
thee
by
too
many
bands
thou
sayest
farewell
and
lo
i
have
thee
by
the
hands
and
will
not
let
thee
go
i
found
out
walking
the
flower
my
love
loves
best
what
when
i
stooped
to
pluck
it
could
dare
my
hand
arrest
was
it
a
snake
lay
curling
about
the
root
thick
crown
or
did
some
hidden
bramble
tear
my
hand
reaching
down
there
was
no
snake
uncurling
and
no
thorn
wounded
me
was
my
heart
checked
me
sighing
she
is
beyond
the
sea
a
poppy
grows
upon
the
shore
bursts
her
twin
cup
in
summer
late
her
leaves
are
and
hoar
her
petals
yellow
delicate
oft
to
her
cousins
turns
her
thought
in
wonder
if
they
care
that
she
is
fed
with
spray
for
dew
and
caught
by
every
gale
that
sweeps
the
sea
she
has
no
lovers
like
the
red
that
dances
with
the
noble
corn
her
blossoms
on
the
waves
are
shed
where
she
stands
shivering
and
forlorn
sometimes
when
my
lady
sits
by
me
my
rapture
so
great
that
i
tear
my
mind
from
the
thought
that
she
nigh
me
and
strive
to
forget
that
she
there
and
sometimes
when
she
is
away
her
absence
so
sorely
does
try
me
that
i
shut
to
my
eyes
and
assay
to
think
she
is
there
sitting
by
me
long
are
the
hours
the
sun
is
above
but
when
evening
comes
i
go
home
to
my
love
i
away
the
daylight
hours
and
more
yet
she
comes
not
down
to
open
the
door
she
does
not
meet
me
upon
the
stair
she
sits
in
my
chamber
and
waits
for
me
there
as
i
enter
the
room
she
does
not
move
i
always
walk
straight
up
to
my
love
and
she
lets
me
take
my
wonted
place
at
her
side
and
gaze
in
her
dear
dear
face
there
as
i
sit
from
her
head
thrown
back
her
hair
falls
straight
in
a
shadow
black
aching
and
hot
as
my
tired
eyes
be
she
is
all
that
i
wish
to
see
and
in
my
wearied
and
ear
she
says
all
things
that
i
wish
to
hear
dusky
and
duskier
grows
the
room
yet
i
see
her
best
in
the
darker
gloom
when
the
winter
eves
are
early
and
cold
the
firelight
hours
are
a
dream
of
gold
and
so
i
sit
here
night
by
night
in
rest
and
enjoyment
of
love
delight
but
a
knock
at
the
door
a
step
on
the
stair
will
startle
alas
my
love
from
her
chair
if
a
stranger
comes
she
will
not
stay
at
the
first
alarm
she
is
off
and
away
and
he
wonders
my
guest
usurping
her
throne
that
i
sit
so
much
by
myself
alone
who
has
not
walked
upon
the
shore
and
who
does
not
the
morning
know
the
day
the
angry
gale
is
the
hour
the
wind
has
ceased
to
blow
the
horses
of
the
strong
are
pastured
round
his
tropic
tent
careless
how
long
the
ocean
breast
sob
on
and
sigh
for
passion
spent
the
frightened
birds
that
fled
inland
to
house
in
rock
and
tower
and
tree
are
gathering
on
the
peaceful
strand
to
tempt
again
the
sunny
sea
whereon
the
timid
ships
steal
out
and
laugh
to
find
their
foe
asleep
that
lately
scattered
them
about
and
drave
them
to
the
fold
like
sheep
the
clouds
he
northward
chased
break
into
phalanx
line
and
band
all
one
way
to
the
south
they
haste
the
south
their
pleasant
fatherland
from
distant
hills
their
shadows
creep
arrive
in
turn
and
mount
the
lea
and
flit
across
the
downs
and
leap
sheer
off
the
cliff
upon
the
sea
and
sail
and
sail
far
out
of
sight
but
still
i
watch
their
fleecy
trains
that
piling
all
the
south
with
light
dapple
in
france
the
fertile
plains
i
made
another
song
in
likeness
of
my
love
and
sang
it
all
day
long
around
beneath
above
i
told
my
secret
out
that
none
might
be
in
doubt
i
sang
it
to
the
sky
that
veiled
his
face
to
hear
how
far
her
azure
eye
outdoes
his
splendid
sphere
but
at
her
eyelids
name
his
white
clouds
fled
for
shame
i
told
it
to
the
trees
and
to
the
flowers
confest
and
said
not
one
of
these
is
like
my
lily
drest
nor
spathe
nor
petal
dared
vie
with
her
body
bared
i
shouted
to
the
sea
that
set
his
waves
her
floating
hair
is
free
free
are
her
feet
to
dance
and
for
thy
wrath
i
swear
her
frown
is
more
to
fear
and
as
in
happy
mood
i
walked
and
sang
alone
at
eve
beside
the
wood
i
met
my
love
my
own
and
sang
to
her
the
song
i
had
sung
all
day
long
elegy
on
a
lady
whom
grief
for
the
death
of
her
betrothed
killed
assemble
all
ye
maidens
at
the
door
and
all
ye
loves
assemble
far
and
wide
proclaim
the
bridal
that
proclaimed
before
has
been
deferred
to
this
late
eventide
for
on
this
night
the
bride
the
days
of
her
betrothal
over
leaves
the
parental
hearth
for
evermore
the
bride
goes
forth
to
meet
her
lover
reach
down
the
wedding
vesture
that
has
lain
yet
all
unvisited
the
silken
gown
bring
out
the
bracelets
and
the
golden
chain
her
dearer
friends
provided
sere
and
brown
bring
out
the
festal
crown
and
set
it
on
her
forehead
lightly
though
it
be
withered
twine
no
wreath
again
this
only
is
the
crown
she
can
wear
rightly
cloke
her
in
ermine
for
the
night
is
cold
and
wrap
her
warmly
for
the
night
is
long
in
pious
hands
the
flaming
torches
hold
while
her
attendants
chosen
from
among
her
faithful
virgin
throng
may
lay
her
in
her
cedar
litter
decking
her
coverlet
with
sprigs
of
gold
roses
and
lilies
white
that
best
befit
her
sound
flute
and
tabor
that
the
bridal
be
not
without
music
nor
with
these
alone
but
let
the
viol
lead
the
melody
with
lesser
intervals
and
plaintive
moan
of
sinking
semitone
and
all
in
choir
the
virgin
voices
rest
not
from
singing
in
skilled
harmony
the
song
that
aye
the
bridegroom
ear
rejoices
let
the
priests
go
before
arrayed
in
white
and
let
the
minstrels
follow
slow
next
they
that
bear
her
honoured
on
this
night
and
then
the
maidens
in
a
double
row
each
singing
soft
and
low
and
each
on
high
a
torch
upstaying
unto
her
lover
lead
her
forth
with
light
with
music
and
with
singing
and
with
praying
was
at
this
sheltering
hour
he
nightly
came
and
found
her
trusty
window
open
wide
and
knew
the
signal
of
the
timorous
flame
that
long
the
restless
curtain
would
not
hide
her
form
that
stood
beside
as
scarce
she
dared
to
be
delighted
listening
to
that
sweet
tale
that
is
no
shame
to
faithful
lovers
that
their
hearts
have
plighted
but
now
for
many
days
the
dewy
grass
has
shown
no
markings
of
his
feet
at
morn
and
watching
she
has
seen
no
shadow
pass
the
moonlit
walk
and
heard
no
music
borne
upon
her
ear
forlorn
in
vain
has
she
looked
out
to
greet
him
he
has
not
come
he
will
not
come
alas
so
let
us
bear
her
out
where
she
must
meet
him
now
to
the
river
bank
the
priests
are
come
the
bark
is
ready
to
receive
its
freight
let
some
prepare
her
place
therein
and
some
embark
the
litter
with
its
slender
weight
the
rest
stand
by
in

there
before
thee
in

that

thou

already

inhaling
the
odorous

i
watch
thee
enter
unerringly
where
thou
goest
and
anchor
queen
of
the
strange
shipping
there
thy
sails
for
awnings
spread
thy
masts
bare
nor
is
aught
from
the
foaming

to
the
grandest
peak
that
is
over
the
feathery

more
fair
than
thou
so
upright
so

evening
i
saw
the
clad
in

walking
the
sprinkled
meadows
at
sundown
while
yet
the
moon
cold
flame
was
hung
between
the
day
and
night
above
the
dusky
town
i
saw
her
brighter
than
the
western
gold
whereto
she
faced
in
splendour
to
behold
her
dress
was
greener
than
the
tenderest
leaf
that
trembled
in
the
sunset
glare
aglow
herself
more
delicate
than
is
the
brief
pink
that
may
showers
lay
low
and
more
delicious
than
the
earliest
streak
the
blushing
rose
shows
of
her
crimson
cheek
as
if
to
match
the
sight
that
so
did
please
a
music
entered
making
passion
fain
three
nightingales
sat
singing
in
the
trees
and
praised
the
goddess
for
the
fallen
rain
which
yet
their
unseen
motions
did
arouse
or
parting
zephyrs
shook
out
from
the
boughs
and
the
treetops
scattered
in
mid
air
the
exhausted
clouds
laden
with
crimson
light
floated
or
seemed
to
sleep
and
highest
there
one
planet
broke
the
lingering
ranks
of
night
daring
day
company
so
he
might
spy
the
once
with
his
watchful
eye
and
when
i
saw
her
then
i
worshipped
her
and
said
o
bounteous
spring
o
beauteous
spring
mother
of
all
my
years
thou
who
dost
stir
my
heart
to
adore
thee
and
my
tongue
to
sing
flower
of
my
fruit
of
my
heart
blood
the
fire
of
all
my
satisfaction
the
desire
how
art
thou
every
year
more
beautiful
younger
for
all
the
winters
thou
hast
cast
and
i
for
all
my
love
grows
grow
more
dull
decaying
with
each
season
overpast
in
vain
to
teach
him
love
must
man
employ
thee
the
more
he
learns
the
less
he
can
enjoy
thee
wooing
i
know
not
how
i
came
new
on
my
knightly
journey
to
win
the
fairest
dame
that
graced
my
maiden
tourney
chivalry
lovely
prize
with
all
men
gaze
upon
her
why
did
she
free
her
eyes
on
me
to
do
me
honour
ah
had
i
my
mind
with
such
high
hope
delighted
had
she
not
first
inclined
and
with
her
eyes
invited
but
never
doubt
i
knew
having
their
glance
to
cheer
me
until
the
day
joy
grew
too
great
too
sure
too
near
me
when
hope
a
fear
became
and
passion
grown
too
tender
now
trembled
at
the
shame
of
a
despised
surrender
and
where
my
love
at
first
saw
kindness
in
her
smiling
i
read
her
pride
and
cursed
the
arts
of
her
beguiling
till
winning
less
than
won
and
liker
wooed
than
wooing
too
late
i
turned
undone
away
from
my
undoing
and
stood
beside
the
door
whereto
she
followed
making
my
hard
more
hard
by
her
sweet
her
speech
would
have
betrayed
her
thought
had
mine
been
colder
her
eyes
distress
had
made
a
lesser
lover
bolder
but
no
fond
heart
distrust
cried
wisdom
and
consider
go
free
since
go
thou
must
and
so
farewell
i
bid
her
and
brisk
upon
my
way
i
smote
the
stroke
to
sever
and
should
have
lost
that
day
my
life
delight
for
ever
but
when
i
saw
her
start
and
turn
aside
and
tremble
ah
she
was
true
her
heart
i
knew
did
not
dissemble
there
is
a
hill
beside
the
silver
thames
shady
with
birch
and
beech
and
odorous
pine
and
brilliant
underfoot
with
thousand
gems
steeply
the
thickets
to
his
floods
decline
straight
trees
in
every
place
their
thick
tops
interlace
and
pendant
branches
trail
their
foliage
fine
upon
his
watery
face
swift
from
the
sweltering
pasturage
he
flows
his
stream
alert
to
seek
the
pleasant
shade
pictures
his
gentle
purpose
as
he
goes
straight
to
the
caverned
pool
his
toil
has
made
his
winter
floods
lay
bare
the
stout
roots
in
the
air
his
summer
streams
are
cool
when
they
have
played
among
their
fibrous
hair
a
rushy
island
guards
the
sacred
bower
and
hides
it
from
the
meadow
where
in
peace
the
lazy
cows
wrench
many
a
scented
flower
robbing
the
golden
market
of
the
bees
and
laden
barges
float
by
banks
of
myosote
and
scented
flag
and
golden
delay
the
loitering
boat
and
on
this
side
the
island
where
the
pool
eddies
away
are
tangled
mass
on
mass
the
that
net
the
fishes
cool
and
scarce
allow
a
narrow
stream
to
pass
where
spreading
crowfoot
mars
the
drowning
nenuphars
waving
the
tassels
of
her
silken
grass
below
her
silver
stars
but
in
the
purple
pool
there
nothing
grows
not
the
white
spoked
with
gold
though
best
she
loves
the
hollows
and
well
knows
on
quiet
streams
her
broad
shields
to
unfold
yet
should
her
roots
but
try
within
these
deeps
to
lie
not
her
long
reaching
stalk
could
ever
hold
her
waxen
head
so
high
sometimes
an
angler
comes
and
drops
his
hook
within
its
hidden
depths
and
a
tree
leaning
his
rod
reads
in
some
pleasant
book
forgetting
soon
his
pride
of
fishery
and
dreams
or
falls
asleep
while
curious
fishes
peep
about
his
nibbled
bait
or
scornfully
dart
off
and
rise
and
leap
and
sometimes
a
slow
figure
the
trees
in
smock
with
tottering
care
upon
a
staff
propping
his
weary
knees
may
by
the
pathway
of
the
forest
fare
as
from
a
buried
day
across
the
mind
will
stray
some
perishing
mute
shadow
and
unaware
he
passeth
on
his
way
else
he
that
wishes
solitude
is
safe
whether
he
bathe
at
morning
in
the
stream
or
lead
his
love
there
when
the
hot
hours
chafe
the
meadows
busy
with
a
blurring
steam
or
watch
as
fades
the
light
the
gibbous
moon
grow
bright
until
her
magic
rays
dance
in
a
dream
and
glorify
the
night
where
is
this
bower
beside
the
silver
thames
o
pool
and
flowery
thickets
hear
my
vow
o
trees
of
freshest
foliage
and
straight
stems
no
sharer
of
my
secret
i
allow
lest
ere
i
come
the
while
strange
feet
your
shades
defile
or
lest
the
burly
oarsman
turn
his
prow
within
your
guardian
isle
a
let
us
as
by
this
verdant
bank
we
float
search
down
the
marge
to
find
some
shady
pool
where
we
may
rest
awhile
and
moor
our
boat
and
bathe
our
tired
limbs
in
the
waters
cool
beneath
the
noonday
sun

plumbing
with
my

the
stern
in
beneath
this
bowering
tree
now
stepping
on
this
stump
we
are
ashore
guard
hamadryades
our
clothes
laid
by
your
trees
how
the
birds
warble
in
the
woods
i
pick
the
waxen

diving
to
the
root
but
swim
not

stream
the
weeds

thick
and
hot
on

the
sunbeams
shoot
until

us

whether

us
through

sweeping
in
phantom
silence
the
cloudland
flies
with
lovely
undulation
of
fall
and
rise
entrenched
with
thickets
thorned
by
delicate
miniature
dainty
flowers
adorned
i
climb
your

and
lo
a
sight
surprising
of
sea
in
front
uprising
steep
and
wide
and
scattered
ships
ascending
to
heaven
lost
in
the
blending
of
distant
blues
where
water
and
sky
divide
urging
their
engines
against
wind
and
tide
and
all
so
small
and
slow
they
seem
to
be
wearily
pointing
the
way
they
would
go
the
accumulated
murmur
of
soft
plashing
of
waves
on
rocks
dashing
and
searching
the
sands
takes
my
ear
in
the
veering
baffled
wind
as
rearing
upright
at
the
cliff
to
the
gullies
and
rifts
he
stands
and
his
conquering
surges
scour
out
over
the
lands

again
at
the

of
the
downs
he
masses
his
strength
to
recover
the
topmost

with

renewed
the

and
where
the
bare

stood
are
leafy
arbours
seen
and
back
on
budding
boughs
come
birds
to
court
and
pair
whose
rival
amorous
vows
amaze
the
scented
air
the
freshets
are
unbound
and
leaping
from
the
hill
their
mossy
banks
refill
with
streams
of
light
and
sound
and
scattered
down
the

from
hour
to
hour
unfold
a
thousand

beads
in

and
cups
of
gold
now

note
the

all

has
doffed
his
winter

how
with
specks
of
white
they
dot
the
brown
hillside
or
jaunt
and
sing
outright
as
by
their
teams
they
stride
they
sing

the

his
wanton

its
grateful
scent
around
ah
now
an
evil
lot
is
his
who
toils
for
gain
where
crowded
chimneys
stain
the
heavens
his

forgot
is
on
the
blighted

that
deck
his

in
the
tainted

that

spring
comes
to
him

would
choose
the

set
myself
a

enjoy
the

than
invent
a
duty
to
destroy
the

nature

i

the

take
no

crabbèd
fate

like
a
truant

the

of

greet
her

their

here
in

the

contest
her
favour
with
the

themselves

fair
and
forth
their

and
all
the
mire
and
smoke

wrapped
the

now
he
that

his

awake

any
pleasure
take
its
flight

not

his

who
loves

more

has
taught

skilled
his

to
read

on

thee

habiliments
attired
thou
art

and
thee
i
can
not

nay
were
my
last
hope
quenched
i
here
would
sit
and
praise
the
annihilation
of
the
pit
nor
quickly
disenchanted
will
my
feet
back
to
the
busy
town
return
but
yet
linger
ere

my

friends
would
greet

touch
their

without
regret
the
warmth
of
that
kind
hearth

sacred
ties
only
shall
dim
with

my
dying
eyes
dejection
wherefore
so
full
of
care
my
soul
revolving
hopeless
strife
pointing
at
hindrance
and
the
bare
painful
escapes
of
fitful
life
shaping
the
doom
that
may
befall
by
precedent
of
terror
past
by
love
dishonoured
and
the
call
of
friendship
slighted
at
the
last
by
treasured
names
the
little
store
that
memory
out
of
wreck
could
save
of
loving
hearts
that
gone

call
their

patient
thou
shall
find
a
little

mend
all
this
some
strain
of
music
to
thy

some
praise
for
skill
not
spent
amiss
again
shall
pleasure
overflow
thy
cup
with
sweetness
thou
shalt
taste
nothing

sweetness

grow
half

hear
thee

when

were
all
asleep
the
snow
came
flying
in
large
white
flakes
falling
on
the
city
brown
stealthily
and
perpetually
settling
and
loosely
lying
hushing
the
latest
traffic
of
the
drowsy
town
deadening
muffling
stifling
its
murmurs
failing
lazily
and
incessantly
floating
down
and
down
silently
sifting
and
veiling
road

and
railing
hiding

making
unevenness
even
into
angles
and

softly
drifting
and
sailing
all
night
it
fell
and
when
full

seven
it
lay
in
the
depth
of
its
uncompacted
lightness
the
clouds
blew
off
from
a
high
and
frosty
heaven
and
all
woke
earlier
for
the
unaccustomed
brightness
of
the
winter
dawning
the
strange
unheavenly
glare
the
eye
marvelled
marvelled
at
the
dazzling
whiteness
the
ear
hearkened
to
the
stillness
of
the
solemn
air
no
sound
of
wheel
rumbling
nor
of
foot
falling
and
the
busy
morning
cries
came
thin
and
spare
then
boys
i
heard
as
they
went
to
school
calling
they
gathered
up
the
crystal
manna
to
freeze
their
tongues
with
tasting
their
hands
with
snowballing
or
rioted
in
a
drift
plunging
up
to
the
knees
or
peering
up
from
under
the
wonder
look
at
the

they
cried

at

following
along

now
already
the
sun
in
pale
display
standing
by
paul
high
dome
spread
forth
below
his
sparkling
beams
and
awoke
the
stir
of
the
day
for
now
doors
open
and
war
is
waged
with
the
snow
and
trains
of
sombre
men
past

of

tread
long
brown
paths
as
toward
their
toil
they
go
but
even
for
them
awhile
no

their

diverted
the

unspoken
the
daily

the

paling
a

field
afar
in
the
mournful
sea
the
scourge
of
the
surf
and
plaintive
gulls
sailing
at
ease
on
the
gale

smites
the

i

in

the
silent
river
glides
by
flowery
banks
and
birds
sing
sweetly
in
branches
that
arch
an
alley
of

trees
in
their
ancient
ranks
where
if
a
light

stray
is
laden
with
hum
of

and

and

be
thine

if

that
scarce
dost
rock
the

or
a

to

but
for
the
woods
and
summer
asleep
in
them
for
you
my
bowers
green
my
hedges
of
rose
and
woodbine
with
walks
between
then
well
could
i
read
wisdom
in
every
feature
o
well
should
i
understand
the
voice
of
nature
on
a
dead
child
perfect
little
body
without
fault
or
stain
on
thee
with
promise
of
strength
and
manhood
full
and
fair
though
cold
and
stark
and
bare
the
bloom
and
the
charm
of
life
doth
awhile
remain
on
thee
thy
mother
treasure
wert
thou
alas
no
longer
to
visit
her
heart
with
wondrous
joy
to
be
thy
father
pride
ah
he
must
gather
his
faith
together
and
his
strength
make
stronger
to
me
as
i
move
thee
now
in
the
last
duty
dost
thou
with
a
turn
or
gesture
anon
respond
startling
my
fancy
fond
with
a
chance
attitude
of
the
head
a
freak
of
beauty
thy
hand
clasps
as
was
wont
my
finger
and
holds
it
but
the
grasp
is
the
clasp
of
death
heartbreaking
and
stiff
yet
feels
to
my
hand
as
if
was
still
thy
will
thy
pleasure
and
trust
that
enfolds
it
so
i
lay
thee
there
thy
sunken
eyelids
closing
go
lie
thou
there
in
thy
coffin
thy
last
little
bed
propping
thy
wise
sad
head
thy
firm
pale
hands
across
thy
chest
disposing
so
quiet
doth
the
change
content
thee
death
whither
he
taken
thee
to
a
world
do
i
think
that
rights
the
disaster
of
this
the
vision
of
which
i
miss
who
weep
for
the
body
and
wish
but
to
warm
thee
and
awaken
thee
ah
little
at
best
can
all
our
hopes
avail
us
to
lift
this
sorrow
or
cheer
us
when
in
the
dark
unwilling
alone
we
embark
and
the
things
we
have
seen
and
have
known
and
have
heard
of
fail
us
the
philosopher
to
his
mistress
because
thou
canst
not
see
because
thou
canst
not
know
the
black
and
hopeless
woe
that
hath
encompassed
me
because
should
i
confess
the
thought
of
my
despair
my
words
would
wound
thee
less
than
swords
can
hurt
the
air
because
with
thee
i
seem
as
one
invited
near
to
taste
the
faery
cheer
of
spirits
in
a
dream
of
whom
he
knoweth
nought
save
that
they
vie
to
make
all
motion
voice
and
thought
a
pleasure
for
his
sake
therefore
more
sweet
and
strange
has
been
the
mystery
of
thy
long
love
to
me
that
doth
not
quit
nor
change
nor
tax
my
solemn
heart
that
kisseth
in
a
gloom
knowing
not
who
thou
art
that
givest
nor
to
whom
therefore
the
tender
touch
is
more
more
dear
the
smile
and
thy
light
words
beguile
my
wisdom
overmuch
and
o
with
swiftness
fly
the
fancies
of
my
song
to
happy
worlds
where
i
still
in
thy
love
belong
haste
on
my
joys
your
treasure
lies
in
swift
unceasing
flight
o
haste
for
while
your
beauty
flies
i
seize
your
full
delight
lo
i
have
seen
the
scented
flower
whose
tender
stems
i
cull
for
her
brief
date
and
meted
hour
appear
more
beautiful
o
youth
o
strength
o
most
divine
for
that
so
short
ye
prove
were
but
your
rare
gifts
longer
mine
ye
scarce
would
win
my
love
nay
life
itself
the
heart
would
spurn
did
once
the
days
restore
the
days
that
once
enjoyed
return
return
ah
nevermore
indolence
we
left
the
city
when
the
summer
day
had
verged
already
on
its
hot
decline
and
charmèd
indolence
in
languor
lay
in
her
gay
gardens
her
towers
divine
we
said
city
of
youth
and
dream
and
in
our
boat
we
stepped
and
took
the
stream
all
through
that
idle
afternoon
we
strayed
upon
our
proposed
travel
well
begun
as
loitering
by
the
woodland
dreamy
shade
past
shallow
islets
floating
in
the
sun
or
searching
down
the
banks
for
rarer
flowers
we
lingered
out
the
pleasurable
hours
till
when
that
loveliest
came
which
mowers
home
turns
from
their
longest
labour
as
we
steered
along
a
straitened
channel
flecked
with
foam
we
lost
our
landscape
wide
and
slowly
neared
an
ancient
bridge
that
like
a
blind
wall
lay
low
on
its
buried
vaults
to
block
the
way
then
soon
the
narrow
tunnels
broader
showed
where
with
its
arches
three
it
sucked
the
mass
of
water
that
in
swirl
thereunder
flowed
or
stood
piled
at
the
piers
waiting
to
pass
and
pulling
for
the
middle
span
we
drew
the
tender
blades
aboard
and
floated
through
but
past
the
bridge
what
change
we
found
below
the
stream
that
all
day
long
had
laughed
and
played
betwixt
the
happy
shires
ran
dark
and
slow
and
with
its
easy
flood
no
murmur
made
and
weeds
spread
on
its
surface
and
about
the
stagnant
margin
reared
their
stout
heads
out
upon
the
left
high
elms
with
giant
wood
skirting
the
interwove
their
slumbrous
crowns
where
they
stood
the
floor
and
heavy
pillars
of
the
grove
and
in
the
shade
through
reeds
and
sedges
dank
a
footpath
led
along
the
moated
bank
across
all
down
the
right
an
old
brick
wall
above
and
the
channel
red
did
lean
here
buttressed
up
and
bulging
there
to
fall
tufted
with
grass
and
plants
and
lichen
green
and
crumbling
to
the
flood
which
at
its
base
slid
gently
nor
disturbed
its
mirrored
face
sheer
on
the
wall
the
houses
rose
their
backs
all
windowless
neglected
and
awry
with
tottering
coigns
and
crooked
chimney
stacks
and
here
and
there
an
unused
door
set
high
above
the
fragments
of
its
mouldering
stair
with
rail
and
broken
step
led
out
on
air
beyond
deserted
wharfs
and
vacant
sheds
with
empty
boats
and
barges
moored
along
and
rafts
fringed
with
weedy
shreds
and
sodden
beams
once
soaked
to
season
strong
no
sight
of
man
nor
sight
of
life
no
stroke
no
voice
the
somnolence
and
silence
broke
then
i
who
rowed
leant
on
my
oar
whose
drip
fell
without
sparkle
and
i
rowed
no
more
and
he
that
steered
moved
neither
hand
nor
lip
but
turned
his
wondering
eye
from
shore
to
shore
and
our
trim
boat
let
her
swift
motion
die
between
the
dim
reflections
floating
by
i
praise
the
tender
flower
that
on
a
mournful
day
bloomed
in
my
garden
bower
and
made
the
winter
gay
its
loveliness
contented
my
heart
tormented
i
praise
the
gentle
maid
whose
happy
voice
and
smile
to
confidence
betrayed
my
doleful
heart
awhile
and
gave
my
spirit
deploring
fresh
wings
for
soaring
the
maid
for
very
fear
of
love
i
durst
not
tell
the
rose
could
never
hear
though
i
bespake
her
well
so
in
my
song
i
bind
them
for
all
to
find
them
a
winter
night
with
the
snow
about
was
silent
within
and
cold
without
both
father
and
mother
to
bed
were
gone
the
son
sat
yet
by
the
fire
alone
he
gazed
on
the
fire
and
dreamed
again
of
one
that
was
now
no
more
among
men
as
still
he
sat
and
never
aware
how
close
was
the
spirit
beside
his
chair
nay
sad
were
his
thoughts
for
he
wept
and
said
ah
woe
for
the
dead
ah
woe
for
the
dead
how
heavy
the
earth
lies
now
on
her
breast
the
lips
that
i
kissed
and
the
hand
i
pressed
the
spirit
he
saw
not
he
could
not
hear
the
comforting
word
she
spake
in
his
ear
his
heart
in
the
grave
with
her
mouldering
clay
no
welcome
gave
and
she
fled
away
my
bed
and
pillow
are
cold
my
heart
is
faint
with
dread
the
air
hath
an
odour
of
mould
i
dream
i
lie
with
the
dead
i
can
not
move
o
come
to
me
love
or
else
i
am
dead
the
feet
i
hear
on
the
floor
tread
heavily
overhead
o
love
come
down
to
the
door
come
love
come
ere
i
be
dead
make
shine
thy
light
o
love
in
the
night
or
else
i
am
dead
o
thou
unfaithful
still
as
ever
dearest
that
in
thy
beauty
to
my
eyes
appearest
in
fancy
rising
now
to
my
love
unshaken
all
forgotten
but
no
change
can
free
thee
no
hate
unmake
thee
as
thou
wert
i
see
thee
and
am
contented
eye
from
fond
eye
meeting
its
ample
greeting
o
thou
my
star
of
stars
among
things
wholly
devoted
sacred
dim
and
melancholy
the
only
joy
of
all
the
joys
i
cherished
that
hast
not
perished
why
now
on
others
thou
the
treasure
that
to
be
jealous
of
is
still
my
pleasure
as
still
i
dream
is
me
whom
thou
invitest
me
thou
delightest
but
day
by
day
my
joy
hath
feebler
being
the
fading
picture
tires
my
painful
seeing
and
faery
fancy
leaves
her
habitation
to
desolation
of
two
things
open
left
for
lovers
parted
was
thine
to
scorn
the
past
and
go
lighthearted
but
i
would
ever
dream
i
still
possess
it
and
thus
caress
it
thou
didst
delight
my
eyes
yet
who
am
i
nor
first
nor
last
nor
best
that
durst
once
dream
of
thee
for
prize
nor
this
the
only
time
thou
shalt
set
love
to
rhyme
thou
didst
delight
my
ear
ah
little
praise
thy
voice
makes
other
hearts
rejoice
makes
all
ears
glad
that
hear
and
short
my
joy
but
yet
o
song
do
not
forget
for
what
wert
thou
to
me
how
shall
i
say
the
moon
that
poured
her
midnight
noon
upon
his
wrecking
sea
a
sail
that
for
a
day
has
cheered
the
castaway
joy
sweetest
lifeborn
joy
where
dost
thou
dwell
upon
the
formless
moments
of
our
being
flitting
to
mock
the
ear
that
heareth
well
to
escape
the
trainèd
eye
that
strains
in
seeing
dost
thou
fly
with
us
whither
we
are
fleeing
or
home
in
our
creations
to
withstand
death
that
slays
the
making
hand
the
making
mind
that
must
untimely
perish
amidst
its
work
which
time
may
not
destroy
the
beauteous
forms
which
man
shall
love
to
cherish
the
glorious
songs
that
combat
earth
annoy
thou
dost
dwell
here
i
know
divinest
joy
but
they
who
build
thy
towers
fair
and
strong
of
all
that
toil
feel
most
of
care
and
wrong
sense
is
so
tender
o
and
hope
so
high
that
common
pleasures
mock
their
hope
and
sense
and
swifter
than
doth
lightning
from
the
sky
the
ecstasy
they
pine
for
flashes
hence
leaving
the
darkness
and
the
woe
immense
wherewith
it
seems
no
thread
of
life
was
woven
nor
doth
the
track
remain
where
once
was
cloven
and
heaven
and
all
the
stable
elements
that
guard
god
purpose
mock
us
though
the
mind
be
spent
in
searching
for
his
old
intents
we
see
were
never
for
our
joy
designed
they
shine
as
doth
the
bright
sun
on
the
blind
or
like
his
pensioned
stars
that
hymn
above
his
praise
but
not
toward
us
that
god
is
love
for
who
so
well
hath
wooed
the
maiden
hours
as
quite
to
have
won
the
worth
of
their
rich
show
to
rob
the
night
of
mystery
or
the
flowers
of
their
sweet
delicacy
ere
they
go
nay
even
the
dear
occasion
when
we
know
we
miss
the
joy
and
on
the
gliding
day
the
special
glories
float
and
pass
away
only
life
common
plod
still
to
repair
the
body
and
the
thing
which
perisheth
the
soil
the
smutch
the
toil
and
ache
and
wear
the
grinding
enginry
of
blood
and
breath
pain
random
darts
the
heartless
spade
of
death
all
is
but
grief
and
heavily
we
call
on
the
last
terror
for
the
end
of
all
then
comes
the
happy
moment
not
a
stir
in
any
tree
no
portent
in
the
sky
the
morn
doth
neither
hasten
nor
defer
the
morrow
hath
no
name
to
call
it
by
but
life
and
joy
are
one
we
know
not
why
as
though
our
very
blood
long
breathless
lain
had
tasted
of
the
breath
of
god
again
and
having
tasted
it
i
speak
of
it
and
praise
him
thinking
how
i
trembled
then
when
his
touch
strengthened
me
as
now
i
sit
in
wonder
reaching
out
beyond
my
ken
reaching
to
turn
the
day
back
and
my
pen
urging
to
tell
a
tale
which
told
would
seem
the
witless
phantasy
of
them
that
dream
but
o
most
blessèd
truth
for
truth
thou
art
abide
thou
with
me
till
my
life
shall
end
divinity
hath
surely
touched
my
heart
i
have
possessed
more
joy
than
earth
can
lend
i
may
attain
what
time
shall
never
spend
only
let
not
my
duller
days
destroy
the
memory
of
thy
witness
and
my
joy
the
full
moon
from
her
cloudless
skies
turneth
her
face
i
think
on
me
and
from
the
hour
when
she
doth
rise
till
when
she
sets
none
else
will
see
one
only
other
ray
she
hath
that
makes
an
angle
close
with
mine
and
glancing
down
its
happy
path
upon
another
spot
doth
shine
but
that
ray
too
is
sent
to
me
for
where
it
lights
there
dwells
my
heart
and
if
i
were
where
i
would
be
both
rays
would
shine
love
where
thou
art
awake
my
heart
to
be
loved

now
with
trust
the

thou

to
heaven
i
turn
my
face
one
splendour
thence
is
shed
from
all
the
stars
above
is
namèd
when
god
name
is
said
is
love
is
heavenly
love
and
every
gentle
heart
that
burns
with
true
desire
is
lit
from
eyes
that
mirror
part
of
that
celestial
fire
o
love
my
muse
how
for
me
among
the
best
to
dare
in
thy
high
courts
that
bowed
the
knee
with
sacrifice
and
prayer
their
mighty
offerings
at
thy
shrine
shamed
me
who
nothing
bore
their
suits
were
mockeries
of
mine
i
sued
for
so
much
more
full
many
i
met
that
crowned
with
bay
in
triumph
home
returned
and
many
a
master
on
the
way
proud
of
the
prize
i
scorned
i
wished
no
garland
on
my
head
nor
treasure
in
my
hand
my
gift
the
longing
that
me
led
my
prayer
thy
high
command
my
love
my
muse
and
when
i
spake
thou
me
thine
that
day
and
more
than
hundred
hearts
could
take
me
to
bear
away
love
on
my
heart
from
heaven
fell
soft
as
the
dew
on
flowers
of
spring
sweet
as
the
hidden
drops
that
swell
their
chalicing
now
never
from
him
do
i
part
hosanna
evermore
i
cry
i
taste
his
savour
in
my
heart
and
bid
all
praise
him
as
do
i
without
him
noughtsoever
is
nor
was
afore
nor
shall
be
nor
any
other
joy
than
his
wish
i
for
mine
to
comfort
me
the
hill
pines
were
sighing
and
chill
was
the
day
a
mist
in
the
valley
lying
blotted
the
pleasant
may
but
deep
in
the
glen
bosom
summer
slept
in
the
fire
of
the
odorous
and
the
hot
scent
of
the
brier
a
ribald
cuckoo
clamoured
and
out
of
the
copse
the
stroke
of
the
iron
axe
that
hammered
the
iron
heart
of
the
oak
anon
a
sound
appalling
as
a
hundred
years
of
pride
crashed
in
the
silence
falling
and
the
shadowy
sighed
the
windmill
the
green
corn
waving
in
the
dale
the
ripe
grass
waving
on
the
hill
i
lean
across
the
paddock
pale
and
gaze
upon
the
giddy
mill
its
hurtling
sails
a
mighty
sweep
cut
thro
the
air
with
rushing
sound
each
strikes
in
fury
down
the
steep
rattles
and
whirls
in
chase
around
beside
his
sacks
the
miller
stands
on
high
within
the
open
door
a
book
and
pencil
in
his
hands
his
grist
and
meal
he
reckoneth
his
tireless
merry
slave
the
wind
is
busy
with
his
work
from
he
comes
to
grind
he
hath
a
will
and
knows
the
way
he
gives
the
creaking
sails
a
spin
the
circling
millstones
faster
flee
the
shuddering
timbers
groan
within
and
down
the
shoot
the
meal
runs
free
the
miller
giveth
him
no
thanks
and
doth
not
much
his
work
he
stands
beside
the
sacks
and
ranks
the
figures
in
his
dusty
book
when
june
is
come
then
all
the
day
i
sit
with
my
love
in
the
scented
hay
and
watch
the
sunshot
palaces
high
that
the
white
clouds
build
in
the
breezy
sky
she
singeth
and
i
do
make
her
a
song
and
read
sweet
poems
the
whole
day
long
unseen
as
we
lie
in
our
haybuilt
home
o
life
is
delight
when
june
is
come
the
pinks
along
my
garden
walks
have
all
shot
forth
their
summer
stalks
thronging
their
buds
tulips
hot
and
blue
their
dazzling
snows
soon
will
lade
the
idle
breath
of
june
and
waken
thro
the
fragrant
night
to
steal
the
pale
moonlight
the
nightingale
at
end
of
may
lingers
each
year
for
their
display
till
when
he
sees
their
blossoms
blown
he
knows
the
spring
is
flown
june
birth
they
greet
and
when
their
bloom
dislustres
withering
on
his
tomb
then
summer
hath
a
shortening
day
and
steps
slow
to
decay
fire
of
heaven
whose
starry
arrow
pierces
the
veil
of
timeless
night
molten
spheres
whose
tempests
narrow
their
floods
to
a
beam
of
gentle
light
to
charm
with
a
quenched
from
fire
the
land
of
delight
the
land
of
desire
smile
of
love
a
flower
planted
sprung
in
the
garden
of
joy
that
art
eyes
that
shine
with
a
glow
enchanted
whose
spreading
fires
encircle
my
heart
and
warm
with
a
drenched
in
fire
my
land
of
delight
my
land
of
desire
the
idle
life
i
lead
is
like
a
pleasant
sleep
wherein
i
rest
and
heed
the
dreams
that
by
me
sweep
and
still
of
all
my
dreams
in
turn
so
swiftly
past
each
in
its
fancy
seems
a
nobler
than
the
last
and
every
eve
i
say
noting
my
step
in
bliss
that
i
have
known
no
day
in
all
my
life
like
this
angel
spirits
of
sleep
with
silver
hair
in
your
meadows
fair
where
the
willows
weep
and
the
sad
moonbeam
on
the
gliding
stream
writes
her
scattered
dream
angel
spirits
of
sleep
dancing
to
the
weir
in
the
hollow
roar
of
its
waters
deep
know
ye
how
men
say
that
ye
haunt
no
more
isle
and
grassy
shore
with
your
moonlit
play
that
ye
dance
not
here
spirits
of
sleep
all
the
summer
night
threading
dances
light
anniversary
what
is
sweeter
than
hay
fresher
than
winds
that
blow
innocent
above
children
play
fairer
and
purer
than
winter
snow
frolic
as
are
the
morns
of
may
if
it
should
be
what
best
i
know
what
is
richer
than
thoughts
that
stray
from
reading
of
poems
that
smoothly
flow
what
is
solemn
like
the
delay
of
concords
linked
in
a
music
slow
dying
thro
vaulted
aisles
away
if
it
should
be
what
best
i
know
what
gives
faith
to
me
when
i
pray
setteth
my
heart
with
joy
aglow
filleth
my
song
with
fancies
gay
maketh
the
heaven
to
which
i
go
the
gladness
of
earth
that
lasteth
for
aye
if
it
should
be
what
best
i
know
but
tell
me
thou
was
on
this
day
that
first
we
loved
five
years
ago
if
is
a
thing
that
i
can
say
though
it
must
be
what
best
we
know
the
summer
trees
are
the
hills
are
wrapped
in
a
mantle
wide
of
folding
rain
by
the
mad
wind
borne
across
the
country
side
his
scourge
of
fury
is
lashing
down
the
golden
corn
that
never
more
shall
rear
its
crown
and
curtsey
to
the
morn
there
shews
no
care
in
heaven
to
save
man
pitiful
patience
or
provide
a
season
for
the
season
slave
whose
trust
hath
toiled
and
died
so
my
proud
spirit
in
me
is
sad
a
wreck
of
fairer
fields
to
mourn
the
ruin
of
golden
hopes
she
had
my
corn
the
birds
that
sing
on
autumn
eves
among
the
leaves
are
but
the
few
that
true
remain
of
budding
may
rejoicing
train
like
autumn
flowers
that
brave
the
frost
and
make
their
show
when
hope
is
lost
these
the
fruits
and
mellow
scent
mourn
not
the
summer
spent
their
notes
thro
all
the
jocund
spring
were
mixed
in
merry
musicking
they
sang
for
love
the
whole
day
long
but
now
their
love
is
all
for
song
now
each
hath
perfected
his
lay
to
praise
the
year
that
hastes
away
they
sit
on
boughs
apart
and
vie
in
single
songs
and
rich
reply
and
oft
as
in
the
copse
i
hear
these
anthems
of
the
dying
year
the
passions
once
her
peace
that
stole
with
flattering
love
my
heart
console
when
my
love
was
away
full
three
days
were
not
sped
i
caught
my
fancy
astray
thinking
if
she
were
dead
and
i
alone
alone
it
seemed
in
my
misery
in
all
the
world
was
none
ever
so
lone
as
i
wept
but
it
did
not
shame
nor
comfort
my
heart
away
i
rode
as
i
might
and
came
to
my
love
at
close
of
day
the
sight
of
her
stilled
my
fears
my
love
and
yet
in
her
eyes
were
tears
which
when
i
questioned
of
o
now
thou
art
come
she
cried
is
fled
but
i
thought
i
never
could
here
abide
if
thou
wert
longer
away
the
storm
is
over
the
land
hushes
to
rest
the
tyrannous
wind
its
strength
fordone
is
fallen
back
in
the
west
to
couch
with
the
sinking
sun
the
last
clouds
fare
with
fainting
speed
and
their
thin
streamers
fly
in
melting
drifts
of
the
sky
already
the
birds
in
the
air
appear
again
the
rooks
return
to
their
haunt
and
one
by
one
proclaiming
aloud
their
care
renew
their
peaceful
chant
torn
and
shattered
the
trees
their
branches
again
reset
they
trim
afresh
the
fair
few
green
and
golden
leaves
withheld
from
the
storm
and
awhile
will
be
handsome
yet
sun
shall
caress
their
remnant
of
loveliness
in
quiet
days
for
a
time
sad
autumn
lingering
warm
shall
humour
their
faded
prime
but
ah
the
leaves
of
summer
that
lie
on
the
ground
what
havoc
the
laughing
timbrels
of
june
that
curtained
the
birds
cradles
and
screened
their
song
that
sheltered
the
cooing
doves
at
noon
of
airy
fans
the
delicate
throng
torn
and
scattered
around
far
out
afield
they
lie
in
the
watery
furrows
die
in
grassy
pools
of
the
flood
they
sink
and
drown
orange
vermilion
golden
and
brown
the
high
year
flaunting
crown
shattered
and
trampled
down
the
day
is
done
the
tired
land
looks
for
night
she
prays
to
the
night
to
keep
in
peace
her
nerves
of
delight
while
silver
mist
upstealeth
silently
and
the
broad
cloud
driving
moon
in
the
clear
sky
lifts
the
firs
her
shining
shield
and
in
her
tranquil
light
sleep
falls
on
forest
and
field
sée
sléep
hath
fallen
the
trees
are
asleep
the
night
is
come
the
land
is
wrapt
in
sleep
ye
thrilled
me
once
ye
mournful
strains
ye
anthems
of
plaintive
woe
my
spirit
was
sad
when
i
was
young
ah
sorrowful
but
since
i
have
found
the
beauty
of
joy
i
have
done
with
proud
dismay
for
man
hug
his
care
the
best
of
his
art
is
gay
and
yet
if
voices
of
fancy
choir
again
in
mine
ear
awake
your
old
lament
is
dear
to
me
still
nor
all
for
memory
sake
is
like
the
dirge
of
sorrow
dead
whose
tears
are
wiped
away
or
drops
of
the
shower
when
rain
is
that
jewel
the
brightened
day
say
who
is
this
with
silvered
hair
so
pale
and
worn
and
thin
who
passeth
here
and
passeth
there
and
looketh
out
and
in
that
useth
not
our
garb
nor
tongue
and
knoweth
things
untold
who
teacheth
pleasure
to
the
young
and
wisdom
to
the
old
no
toil
he
maketh
his
by
day
no
home
his
own
by
night
but
he
take
his
way
he
killeth
our
delight
since
he
is
come
there
nothing
wise
nor
fair
in
man
or
child
unless
his
deep
divining
eyes
have
looked
on
it
and
smiled
whence
came
he
hither
all
alone
among
our
folk
to
spy
there
nought
that
we
can
call
our
own
till
he
shall
hap
to
die
and
i
would
dig
his
grave
full
deep
beneath
the
churchyard
yew
lest
thence
his
wizard
eyes
might
peep
to
mark
the
things
we
do
crown
winter
with
green
and
give
him
good
drink
to
physic
his
spleen
or
ever
he
think
his
mouth
to
the
bowl
his
feet
to
the
fire
and
let
him
good
soul
no
comfort
desire
so
merry
he
be
i
bid
him
abide
and
merry
be
we
this
good
yuletide
the
snow
lies
sprinkled
on
the
beach
and
whitens
all
the
marshy
lea
the
sad
gulls
wail
adown
the
gale
the
day
is
dark
and
black
the
sea
shorn
of
their
crests
the
blighted
waves
with
driven
foam
the
offing
fleck
the
ebb
is
low
and
barely
laves
the
red
rust
of
the
giant
wreck
on
such
a
stony
breaking
beach
my
childhood
chanced
and
chose
to
be
was
here
i
played
and
musing
made
my
friend
the
melancholy
sea
he
from
his
dim
enchanted
caves
with
shuddering
roar
and
onrush
wild
fell
down
in
sacrificial
waves
at
feet
of
his
exulting
child
unto
a
spirit
too
light
for
fear
his
wrath
was
mirth
his
wail
was
glee
my
heart
is
now
too
fixed
to
bow
tho
all
his
tempests
howl
at
me
for
to
the
gain
life
summer
saves
my
solemn
joy
increasing
store
the
tossing
of
his
mournful
waves
makes
sweetest
music
evermore
my
spirit
kisseth
thine
my
spirit
embraceth
thee
i
feel
thy
being
twine
her
graces
over
me
in
the
fold
of
god
breath
where
on
high
in
furthest
space
untold
like
a
lost
world
i
lie
and
my
dreaming
plains
lightens
most
pale
and
fair
a
moon
that
never
wanes
or
more
if
i
compare
like
what
the
shepherd
sees
on
late
dawns
when
thro
the
branchèd
trees
the
lawns
the
huge
unclouded
sun
surprising
the
world
whist
is
all
uprisen
thereon
golden
with
melting
mist
ariel
o
my
angel
my
own
whither
away
then
art
thou
flown
beyond
my
spirit
dominion
that
makest
my
heart
run
over
with
rhyme
renewing
at
will
my
youth
for
a
time
my
servant
my
pretty
minion
now
indeed
i
have
cause
to
mourn
now
thou
returnest
scorn
for
scorn
leave
me
not
to
my
folly
for
when
thou
art
with
me
is
none
so
gay
as
i
and
none
when
away
was
ever
so
melancholy
laus
deo
let
praise
devote
thy
work
and
skill
employ
thy
whole
mind
and
thy
heart
be
lost
in
joy
bringeth
pride
this
constant
thought
humility
that
thy
best
done
is
nought
man
doeth
nothing
well
be
it
great
or
small
save
to
praise
god
but
that
hath
savèd
all
for
god
requires
no
more
than
thou
hast
done
and
takes
thy
work
to
bless
it
for
his
own
book
v
dedicated
to
i
the
winnowers
betwixt
two
billows
of
the
downs
the
little
hamlet
lies
and
nothing
sees
but
the
bald
crowns
of
the
hills
and
the
blue
skies
clustering
beneath
the
long
descent
and
grey
slopes
of
the
wold
the
red
roofs
nestle
oversprent
with
lichen
yellow
as
gold
we
found
it
in
the
sun
basking
what
time
of
year
the
thrush
his
singing
has
begun
ere
the
first
leaves
appear
high
from
his
load
a
woodman
pitched
his
faggots
on
the
stack
in
straw
the
cattle
twitched
sweet
hay
from
crib
and
rack
and
from
the
barn
hard
by
was
borne
a
steady
muffled
din
by
which
we
knew
that
threshèd
corn
was
winnowing
and
went
in
the
sunbeams
on
the
motey
air
streamed
through
the
open
door
and
on
the
brown
arms
moving
bare
and
the
grain
upon
the
floor
one
turns
the
crank
one
stoops
to
feed
the
hopper
lest
it
lack
one
in
the
bushel
scoops
the
seed
one
stands
to
hold
the
sack
we
watched
the
good
grain
rattle
down
and
the
awns
fly
in
the
draught
to
see
us
both
so
pensive
grown
the
honest
labourers
laughed
merry
they
were
because
the
wheat
was
clean
and
plump
and
good
pleasant
to
hand
and
eye
and
meet
for
market
and
for
food
it
chanced
we
from
the
city
were
and
had
not
gat
us
free
in
spirit
from
the
store
and
stir
of
its
immensity
but
here
we
found
ourselves
again
where
humble
harvests
bring
after
much
toil
but
little
grain
is
merry
winnowing
the
affliction
of
richard
love
not
too
much
but
how
when
thou
hast
made
me
such
and
dost
thy
gifts
bestow
how
can
i
love
too
much
though
i
must
fear
to
lose
and
drown
my
joy
in
care
with
all
its
thorns
i
choose
the
path
of
love
and
prayer
though
thou
i
know
not
why
didst
kill
my
childish
trust
that
breach
with
toil
did
i
repair
because
i
must
and
spite
of
frighting
schemes
with
which
the
fiends
of
hell
blaspheme
thee
in
my
dreams
so
far
i
have
hoped
well
but
what
the
heavenly
key
what
marvel
in
me
wrought
shall
quite
exculpate
thee
i
have
no
shadow
of
thought
what
am
i
that
complain
the
love
from
which
began
my
question
sad
and
vain
justifies
thee
to
man
since
to
be
loved
endures
to
love
is
wise
earth
hath
no
good
but
yours
brave
joyful
eyes
earth
hath
no
sin
but
thine
dull
eye
of
scorn
thee
the
sun
doth
pine
and
angels
mourn
the
garden
in
september
now
thin
mists
temper
the
beams
of
the
september
sun
his
golden
gleams
on
gaudy
flowers
shine
that
prank
the
rows
of
hollyhocks
and
all
tall
shows
that
autumn
flaunteth
in
his
bushy
bowers
where
tomtits
hanging
from
the
drooping
heads
of
giant
sunflowers
peck
the
nutty
seeds
and
in
the
feathery
aster
bees
on
wing
seize
and
set
free
the
honied
flowers
till
thousand
stars
leap
with
their
visiting
while
ever
across
the
path
mazily
flit
unpiloted
in
the
sun
the
dreamy
butterflies
with
dazzling
colours
powdered
and
soft
glooms
white
black
and
crimson
stripes
and
peacock
eyes
or
on
chance
flowers
sit
with
idle
effort
plundering
one
by
one
the
nectaries
of
blooms
with
gentle
flaws
the
western
breeze
into
the
garden
saileth
scarce
here
and
there
stirring
the
single
trees
for
his
sharpness
he
vaileth
so
long
a
comrade
of
the
bearded
corn
now
from
the
stubbles
whence
the
shocks
are
borne
dewy
lawns
he
turns
to
stray
as
mindful
of
the
kisses
and
soft
play
wherewith
he
enamoured
the
may
ere
he
deserted
her
lover
of
fragrance
and
too
late
repents
nor
more
of
heavy
hyacinth
now
may
drink
nor
spicy
pink
nor
summer
rose
nor
garnered
lavender
but
the
few
lingering
scents
of
streakèd
pea
and
gillyflower
and
stocks
of
courtly
purple
and
aromatic
phlox
and
at
all
times
to
hear
are
drowsy
tones
of
dizzy
flies
and
humming
drones
with
sudden
flap
of
pigeon
wings
in
the
sky
or
the
wild
cry
of
thirsty
rooks
that
scour
ascare
the
distant
blue
to
watering
as
they
fare
with
creaking
pinions
or
on
business
bent
if
aught
their
ancient
polity
displease
come
gathering
to
their
colony
and
there
settling
in
ragged
parliament
some
stormy
council
hold
in
the
high
trees
so
sweet
love
seemed
that
april
morn
when
first
we
kissed
beside
the
thorn
so
strangely
sweet
it
was
not
strange
we
thought
that
love
could
never
change
but
i
can
tell
let
truth
be
told
that
love
will
change
in
growing
old
though
day
by
day
is
nought
to
see
so
delicate
his
motions
be
and
in
the
end
come
to
pass
quite
to
forget
what
once
he
was
nor
even
in
fancy
to
recall
the
pleasure
that
was
all
in
all
his
little
spring
that
sweet
we
found
so
deep
in
summer
floods
is
drowned
i
wonder
bathed
in
joy
complete
how
love
so
young
could
be
so
sweet
larks
what
voice
of
gladness
hark
in
heaven
is
ringing
from
the
sad
fields
the
lark
is
upward
winging
high
through
the
mournful
mist
that
blots
our
day
their
songs
betray
them
soaring
in
the
grey
see
them
nay
they
in
sunlight
swim
above
the
furthest
stain
of
cloud
attain
their
hearts
in
music
rain
upon
the
plain
sweet
birds
far
out
of
sight
your
songs
of
pleasure
dome
us
with
joy
as
bright
as
heaven
best
azure
the
palm
willow
see
whirling
snow
sprinkles
the
starvèd
fields
the
birds
have
stayed
to
sing
no
covert
yet
their
fairy
harbour
yields
when
cometh
spring
ah
in
their
tiny
throats
what
songs
unborn
are
quenched
each
morn
the
lenten
lilies
through
the
frost
that
push
their
yellow
heads
withhold
the
woodland
willow
stands
a
lonely
bush
of
nebulous
gold
there
the
cowers
in
faint
attire
of
frightened
fire
asian
birds
in
this
by
grace
of
heaven
things
shoot
apace
the
waiting
multitude
of
fair
boughs
in
the
wood
how
few
days
have
arrayed
their
beauty
in
green
shade
what
have
i
seen
or
heard
it
was
the
yellow
bird
sang
in
the
tree
he
flew
a
flame
against
the
blue
upward
he
flashed
again
hark
is
his
heavenly
strain
another
hush
behold
many
like
boats
of
gold
from
waving
branch
to
branch
their
airy
bodies
launch
what
music
is
like
this
where
each
note
is
a
kiss
the
golden
willows
lift
their
boughs
the
sun
to
sift
their
sprays
they
droop
to
screen
the
sky
with
veils
of
green
a
floating
cage
of
song
where
feathered
lovers
throng
how
the
delicious
notes
come
bubbling
from
their
throats
full
and
sweet
how
they
are
shed
like
round
pearls
from
a
thread
the
motions
of
their
flight
are
wishes
of
delight
hearing
their
song
i
trace
the
secret
of
their
grace
ah
could
i
this
fair
time
so
fashion
into
rhyme
the
poem
that
i
sing
would
be
the
voice
of
spring
january
cold
is
the
winter
day
misty
and
dark
the
sunless
sky
with
faded
gleams
is
rent
and
patches
of
thin
snow
outlying
mark
the
landscape
with
a
drear
disfigurement
the
trees
their
mournful
branches
lift
aloft
the
oak
with
knotty
twigs
is
full
of
trust
with
bough
the
cherry
in
the
croft
the
chestnut
holds
her
gluey
knops
upthrust
no
birds
sing
but
the
starling
chaps
his
bill
and
chatters
mockingly
the
newborn
lambs
within
their
strawbuilt
fold
beneath
the
hill
answer
with
plaintive
cry
their
bleating
dams
their
voices
melt
in
welcome
dreams
of
spring
green
grass
and
leafy
trees
and
sunny
skies
my
fancy
decks
the
woods
the
thrushes
sing
meadows
are
gay
bees
hum
and
scents
arise
and
god
the
maker
doth
my
heart
grow
bold
to
praise
for
wintry
works
not
understood
who
all
the
worlds
and
ages
doth
behold
evil
and
good
as
one
and
all
as
good
a
robin
robin
on
the
topmost
bough
of
the
leafless
oak
what
singest
thou
hark
he
telleth
how
is
coming
now
spring
is
coming
now
now
ruddy
are
the
against
the
blue
sky
the
pale
larch
donneth
her
jewelry
red
fir
and
black
fir
sigh
and
i
am
lamenting
the
year
gone
by
the
bushes
where
i
nested
are
all
cut
down
they
are
felling
the
tall
trees
one
by
one
and
my
mate
is
dead
and
gone
in
the
winter
she
died
and
left
me
lone
she
lay
in
the
thicket
where
i
fear
to
go
for
when
the
after
the
snow
the
leaves
away
did
blow
she
was
not
there
and
my
heart
is
woe
and
sad
is
my
song
when
i
begin
to
sing
as
i
sit
in
the
sunshine
this
merry
spring
like
a
withered
leaf
i
cling
to
the
white
while
the
wood
doth
ring
spring
is
coming
now
the
sun
again
is
gay
each
day
like
a
last
spring
happy
day
thus
sang
he
then
from
his
spray
he
saw
me
listening
and
flew
away
i
never
shall
love
the
snow
again
since
maurice
died
with
corniced
drift
it
blocked
the
lane
and
sheeted
in
a
desolate
plain
the
country
side
the
trees
with
silvery
rime
bedight
their
branches
bare
by
day
no
sun
appeared
by
night
the
hidden
moon
shed
thievish
light
in
the
misty
air
we
fed
the
birds
that
flew
around
in
flocks
to
be
fed
no
shelter
in
holly
or
brake
they
found
the
speckled
thrush
on
the
frozen
ground
lay
frozen
and
dead
we
skated
on
stream
and
pond
we
cut
the
crinching
snow
to
doric
temple
or
arctic
hut
we
laughed
and
sang
at
nightfall
shut
by
the
fireside
glow
yet
grudged
we
our
keen
delights
before
maurice
should
come
we
said
or
we
shall
love
life
for
a
month
or
more
when
he
is
home
they
brought
him
home
was
two
days
late
for
christmas
day
wrapped
in
white
in
solemn
state
a
flower
in
his
hand
all
still
and
straight
our
maurice
lay
and
two
days
ere
the
year
outgave
we
laid
him
low
the
best
of
us
truly
were
not
brave
when
we
laid
maurice
down
in
his
grave
under
the
snow
nightingales
beautiful
must
be
the
mountains
whence
ye
come
and
bright
in
the
fruitful
valleys
the
streams
wherefrom
ye
learn
your
song
where
are
those
starry
woods
o
might
i
wander
there
among
the
flowers
which
in
that
heavenly
air
bloom
the
year
long
nay
barren
are
those
mountains
and
spent
the
streams
our
song
is
the
voice
of
desire
that
haunts
our
dreams
a
throe
of
the
heart
whose
pining
visions
dim
forbidden
hopes
profound
no
dying
cadence
nor
long
sigh
can
sound
for
all
our
art
alone
aloud
in
the
raptured
ear
of
men
we
pour
our
dark
nocturnal
secret
and
then
as
night
is
withdrawn
from
these
meads
and
bursting
boughs
of
may
dream
while
the
innumerable
choir
of
day
welcome
the
dawn
a
song
of
my
heart
as
the
sun
peered
the
sea
was
born
at
morning
to
me
and
out
of
my
it
chose
a
melody
that
arose
of
all
fair
sounds
that
i
love
remembered
together
in
one
and
i
knew
not
whether
from
waves
of
rustling
wheat
it
was
recoveringly
that
pass
or
a
hum
of
bees
in
the
queenly
robes
of
the
lime
or
a
descant
in
pairing
time
of
warbling
birds
or
watery
bells
of
rivulets
in
the
hills
or
whether
on
blazing
downs
a
high
lark
hymn
alone
in
the
azure
dim
or
a
sough
of
pines
when
the
midnight
wold
is
solitary
and
cold
or
a
lapping
all
day
chiding
the
bow
of
my
wherry
gliding
down
thames
between
his
flowery
shores
to
the
oars
or
anthem
notes
wherever
in
archèd
quires
the
unheeded
music
twires
and
centuries
by
to
the
stony
shade
flies
following
and
to
fade
or
a
homely
prattle
of
children
voices
gay
garden
joys
at
play
or
a
sundown
chaunting
of
solemn
rooks
or
memory
of
my
books
which
hold
the
words
that
poets
in
many
a
tongue
to
the
irksome
world
have
sung
or
the
voice
my
happy
lover
of
thee
now
separated
from
me
a
ruby
of
fire
in
the
burning
sleep
of
my
brain
long
hid
my
thought
had
lain
forgotten
dreams
of
a
thousand
days
ingathering
to
its
rays
the
light
of
life
in
darkness
tempering
long
till
now
a
perfect
song
a
jewel
of
jewels
it
leapt
above
to
the
coronal
of
my
love
founder
day
a
secular
ode
on
the
ninth

with

mother
of

the
north
wind
came
up
yesternight
with
the
new
year
full
moon
and
rising
as
she
gained
her
height
grew
to
a
tempest
soon
yet
found
he
not
on
heaven
face
a
task
of
cloud
to
clear
there
was
no
speck
that
he
might
chase
off
the
blue
hemisphere
nor
vapour
from
the
land
to
drive
the
country
held
nought
motionable
or
alive
that
his
wrath
rebelled
there
scarce
was
hanging
in
the
wood
a
shrivelled
leaf
to
reave
no
bud
had
burst
its
swathing
hood
that
he
could
rend
or
grieve
only
the
tall
where
they
were
shadowed
all
wavered
a
little
on
the
stones
and
on
the
white
like
as
an
artist
in
his
mood
who
reckons
all
as
nought
so
he
may
quickly
paint
his
nude
unutterable
thought
so
nature
in
a
frenzied
hour
by
day
or
night
will
show
dim
indications
of
the
power
that
doometh
man
to
woe
ah
many
have
my
visions
been
and
some
i
know
full
well
i
would
that
all
that
i
have
seen
were
fit
for
speech
to
and
by
the
churchyard
as
i
came
it
seemed
my
spirit
passed
into
a
land
that
hath
no
name
grey
melancholy
and
vast
where
nothing
comes
but
memory
the
widowed
queen
of
death
reigns
and
with
fixed
sepulchral
eye
all
slumber
banisheth
each
grain
of
writhen
dust
that
drapes
that
sickly
staring
shore
its
old
chaotic
change
of
shapes
remembers
evermore
and
ghosts
of
cities
long
decayed
and
ruined
shrines
of
fate
gather
the
paths
that
time
hath
made
foolish
and
desolate
nor
winter
there
hath
hope
of
spring
nor
the
pale
night
of
day
since
the
old
king
with
scorpion
sting
hath
done
himself
away
the
morn
was
calm
the
wind
last
breath
had
in
solemn
hush
the
golden
moon
went
down
beneath
the
dawning
crimson
flush
north
wind
in
october
in
the
golden
glade
the
chestnuts
are
fallen
all
from
the
sered
boughs
of
the
oak
the
acorns
fall
the
beech
scatters
her
ruddy
fire
the
lime
hath
stripped
to
the
cold
and
standeth
naked
above
her
yellow
attire
the
larch
thinneth
her
spire
to
lay
the
ways
of
the
wood
with
cloth
of
gold
out
of
the
and
white
of
the
brake
the
stand
upright
in
the
forest
of
flame
and
wave
aloft
to
the
blue
of
heaven
their
tuftings
soft
but
swiftly
in
shuddering
gloom
the
splendours
fail
as
the
harrying
beareth
a
cloud
of
skirmishing
hail
the
grievèd
woodland
to
smite
in
a
hurricane
through
the
trees
he
teareth
raking
the
boughs
and
the
leaves
rending
and
whistleth
to
the
descending
blows
of
his
icy
flail
gold
and
snow
he
mixeth
in
spite
and
whirleth
afar
as
away
on
his
winnowing
flight
he
passeth
and
all
again
for
awhile
is
bright
first
spring
morning
a
child
poem
look
look
the
spring
is
come
o
feel
the
gentle
air
that
wanders
thro
the
boughs
to
burst
the
thick
buds
everywhere
the
birds
are
glad
to
see
the
high
unclouded
sun
winter
is

adown
the
meadows
green
let
us
go
dance
and
play
and
look
for
violets
in
the
lane
and
ramble
far
away
to
gather
primroses
that
in
the
woodland
grow
and
hunt
for
oxlips
or
if
yet
the
blades
of
bluebells
show
there
the
old
woodman
gruff
hath
half
the
coppice
cut
and
weaves
the
hurdles
all
day
long
beside
his
willow
hut
we
steal
on
him
and
then
startle
him
all
with
glee
singing
our
song
of
winter
fled
and
summer
soon
to
be
a

was
no

with

no

bond
than
that
the
muse
weaves
with
her
dreamy
thread
nor
was
such
transcendent
love
more
fond
than
that
which
edward
unto
basil
led
wandering
alone
across
the
woody
shires
to
hear
the
living
voice
of
that
wide
heart
to
see
the
eyes
that
read
the
world
desires
and
touch
the
hand
that
wrote
the
roving
rhyme
diverse
their
lots
as
distant
were
their
homes
and
since
that
early
meeting
jealous
time
knitting
their
loves
had
held
their
lives
apart
but
now
again
were
these
fine
lovers
met
and
sat
together
on
a
rocky
hill
looking
upon
the
vales
of
somerset
where
the
far
sea
gleam
the
bosky
combes
satisfying
their
spirits
the
livelong
day
with
various
mirth
and
revelation
due
and
delicate
intimacy
of
delight
as
there
in
happy
indolence
they
lay
and
drank
the
sun
while
round
the
breezy
height
beneath
their
feet
rabbit
and
listless
ewe
nibbled
the
scented
herb
and
grass
at
will
much
talked
they
at
their
ease
and
at
the
last
spoke
edward
thus
twas
on
this
very
hill
this
time
of
the
year
but
now
twelve
years
are
past
that
you
provoked
in
verse
my
younger
skill
to
praise
the
months
against
your
rival
song
and
ere
the
sun
had
westered
ten
degrees
our
rhyme
had
brought
him
thro
the
zodiac
have
you
remembered
basil
answer
back
of
my
solace
how
could
i
forget
years
fly
as
months
that
seem
in
youth
so
long
the
precious
life
that
like
indifferent
gold
is
disregarded
in
its
worth
to
hold
some
jewel
of
love
that
god
therein
would
set
it
passeth
and
is
gone
yet
not
all
edward
replied
passion
as
i
please
of
that
past
day
i
can
recall
and
if
but
you
as
i
remember
yet
your
part
thereof
and
will
again
rehearse
for
half
an
hour
we
may
old
time
outwit
and
basil
said
for
my
poor
verse
what
happy
memory
of
it
still
endures

thank
your

lawrence
they
esteem
him
well
to
lay
his
bones
with
michael

who
might
he
be
richard
he
too
a
sculptor
one
who
left
a
work
long
to
resist
the
years
lawrence
you
make
me
question
further
richard
i
can
tell
all
as
we
walk
a
poor
woodcarver
son
prenticed
to
cut
his
father
rude
designs
we
have
it
from
himself
maker
of
shrines
in
his
mean
workshop
in
siena
dreamed
and
saw
as
gods
the
artists
of
the
earth
and
long
to
stand
on
their
immortal
shore
and
be
as
they
who
in
his
vision
gleam
dowering
the
world
with
grace
for
evermore
so
taxing
rest
and
leisure
to
one
aim
the
boy
of
single
will
and
inbred
skill
rose
step
by
step
to
academic
fame
lawrence
do
i
not
know
him
then
his
figures
fill
the
tympana
santa
croce
gate
in
the
museum
too
his
cain
that
stands
a
discobolos
richard
so
great
his
vogue
that
elder
art
of
classic
worth
went
to
the
wall
to
give
his
statues
room
and
last
his
country
praise
could
do
no
more
he
cut
the
stone
that
honoured
good
cavour
lawrence
i
have
seen
the
things
richard
he
finding
in
his
hands
his
possest
fell
not
in
gloom
nor
froth
in
vanity
his
sabbath
he
look
to
spend
in
meditative
rest
so
laying
chisel
by
he
took
a
pen
to
tell
his
story
to
his
countrymen
and
prove
he
did
it
that
the
flower
of
all
rarest
to
attain
is
in
the
power
of
all
lawrence
yet
nought
he
ever
made
that
i
have
learn
in
wood
or
stone
deserved
nay
not
his
best
the
greek
or
tuscan
name
for
beautiful
was
level
with
its
praise
had
force
to
pull
favour
from
fashion
richard
yet
he
made
one
thing
worthy
of
the
lily
city
in
her
spring
for
while
in
vain
the
forms
of
beauty
he
aped
a
perfect
spirit
in
himself
he
shaped
and
all
his
lifetime
doing
less
than
well
where
he
profess
nor
doubted
to
excel
now
where
he
had
no
scholarship
but
drew
his
art
from
love
was
better
than
he
knew
and
when
he
sat
to
write
lo
by
him
stood
the
heavenly
muse
who
smiles
on
all
things
good
and
for
his
truth
sake
for
his
stainless
mind
his
homely
love
and
faith
she
now
grew
kind
and
changed
the
crown
that
from
the
folk
he
got
for
her
green
laurel
and
he
knew
it
not
lawrence
ah
love
of
beauty
this
man
then
mistook
ambition
for
her
richard
in
simplicity
erring
he
kept
his
truth
and
in
his
book
the
statue
of
his
grace
is
fair
to
see
lawrence
then
buried
with
their
great
he
well
may
be
richard

the

not
among

fourth
of

at
eton
and
richard
beneath
the
wattled
bank
the
eddies
swarm
in
wandering
dimples
the
shady
pool
the
same
their
chase
as
when
i
was
at
school
the
same
the
music
where
in
shallows
warm
the
current
sunder
by
the
bushy
isles
returns
to
join
the
main
and
struggles
free
above
the
willows
gurgling
thro
the
piles
nothing
is
changed
and
yet
how
changed
are
we
what
can
bring
godfrey
to
the
muses
bower
godfrey
what
but
brings
you
the
festal
day
of
the
year
to
live
in
boyish
memories
for
an
hour
see
and
be
seen
tho
you
come
seldom
here
richard
dread
of
the
pang
it
was
fear
to
behold
what
once
was
all
myself
that
kept
me
away
godfrey
you
miss
new
pleasures
coveting
the
old
richard
they
need
have
prudence
who
in
courage
lack
was
that
i
might
go
on
i
looked
not
back
godfrey
of
all
our
company
he
who
we
say
fruited
the
laughing
flower
of
liberty
richard
ah
had
i
my
desire
so
should
it
be
godfrey
nay
but
i
know
this
melancholy
mood
was
your
poetic
fancy
when
a
boy
richard
for
fancy
can
not
live
on
real
food
in
youth
she
will
despise
familiar
joy
to
dwell
in
mournful
shades
as
they
grow
real
then
buildeth
she
of
joy
her
far
ideal
godfrey
and
so
perverteth
all
this
stream
to
me
sings
and
in
sunny
ripples
lingeringly
the
water
saith
me
where
have
i
lept
into
what
garden
of
life
what
banks
are
these
what
secret
lawns
what
ancient
towers
and
trees
where
the
young
sons
of
with
shouts
of
play
or
low
delighted
speech
welcome
the
day
as
if
the
poetry
of
the
earth
had
slept
to
wake
in
ecstasy
o
stay
me
alas
stay
me
ye
happy
isles
ere
that
i
pass
without
a
memory
on
my
sullen
course
by
the
black
city
to
the
tossing
seas
richard
so
might
this
old
oak
say
heart
is
sere
with
greater
effort
every
year
i
force
my
stubborn
leafage
soon
my
branch
will
crack
and
i
shall
fall
or
perish
in
the
wrack
and
here
another
tree
its
crown
will
rear
and
see
for
centuries
the
boys
at
play
and
its
boughs
on
some
fine
holiday
old
men
shall
prate
as
these
come
see
the
game
godfrey
yes
if
you
will
is
all
one
picture
fair
richard
made
in
a
mirror
and
who
looketh
there
must
see
himself
is
not
a
dream
the
same
godfrey
is
a
richard
and
you
who
say
it
seem
dreaming
to
speak
to
a
phantom
in
a
dream
elegy
the
on
the
mound
how
well
my
eyes
remember
the
dim
path
my
homing
heart
no
happier
playground
hath
i
need
not
close
my
lids
but
it
appears
through
the
bewilderment
of
forty
years
to
tempt
my
feet
my
childish
feet
between
its
leafy
walls
beneath
its
arching
green
fairer
than
dream
of
sleep
than
hope
more
fair
leading
to
dreamless
sleep
her
sister
care
there
grew
two
fellow
limes
two
rising
trees
shadowing
the
lawn
the
summer
haunt
of
bees
whose
stems
engraved
with
many
a
russet
scar
from
the
of
our
mimic
war
pillar
the
portico
to
that
wide
walk
a
mossy
terrace
of
the
native
chalk
fashion
that
led
thro
the
dark
shades
around
straight
to
the
wooden
temple
on
the
mound
there
live
the
memories
of
my
early
days
there
still
with
childish
heart
my
spirit
plays
yea
by
the
fiend
despair
when
she
hath
fled
me
i
have
found
her
there
and
there
is
ever
noon
and
glad
suns
bring
alternate
days
of
summer
and
of
spring
with
childish
thought
and
childish
faces
bright
and
all
unknown
save
but
the
hour
delight
high
on
the
mound
the
ivied
arbour
stood
a
dome
of
straw
upheld
on
rustic
wood
hidden
in
fern
the
steps
of
the
ascent
whereby
unto
the
southern
front
we
went
and
from
the
dark
plantation
climbing
free
over
a
valley
look
out
on
the
sea
that
sea
is
ever
bright
and
blue
the
sky
serene
and
blue
and
ever
white
ships
lie
high
on
the
horizon
steadfast
in
full
sail
or
nearer
in
the
roads
pass
within
hail
of
naked
brigs
and
barques
that
windbound
ride
at
their
taut
cables
heading
to
the
tide
there
many
an
hour
i
have
sat
to
watch
nay
now
the
brazen
disk
is
cold
against
my
brow
and
in
my
sight
a
circle
of
the
sea
enlarged
to
swiftness
where
the
salt
waves
flee
and
ships
in
stately
motion
pass
so
near
that
what
i
see
is
speaking
to
my
ear
i
hear
the
waves
dash
and
the
tackle
strain
the
canvas
flap
the
rattle
of
the
chain
that
runs
out
thro
the
hawse
the
clank
of
the
winch
winding
the
rusty
cable
inch
by
inch
till
half
i
wonder
if
they
have
no
care
those
sailors
that
my
glass
is
brought
to
bear
on
all
their
doings
if
i
vex
them
not
on
every
petty
task
of
their
rough
lot
prying
and
spying
searching
every
craft
from
painted
truck
to
gunnel
fore
and
aft
thro
idle
sundays
as
i
have
watch
them
lean
long
hours
upon
the
rail
or
neath
its
screen
prone
on
the
deck
to
lie
outstretch
at
length
sunk
in
renewal
of
their
wearied
strength
but
what
a
feast
of
joy
to
me
if
some
frigate
to
the
channel
come
back
here
her
topsail
or
brought
gently
up
let
from
her
bow
the
splashing
anchor
drop
by
faint
contrary
wind
stay
in
her
cruise
the
or
dancing
or
some
immense
of
the
line
romantic
as
the
tale
of
troy
divine
ere
yet
our
iron
age
had
doom
to
fall
the
towering
freeboard
of
the
wooden
wall
and
for
the
engines
of
a
mightier
mars
clipp
their
wide
wings
and
dock
their
soaring
spars
the
gale
that
in
their
tackle
sang
the
wave
that
neath
their
gilded
galleries
dasht
so
brave
lost
then
their
merriment
nor
look
to
play
with
the
monsters
of
one
noon
in
march
upon
that
anchoring
ground
came
napier
fleet
unto
the
baltic
bound
cloudless
the
sky
and
calm
and
blue
the
sea
as
round
saint
margaret
cliff
mysteriously
those
murderous
queens
walking
in
sabbath
sleep
glided
in
line
upon
the
windless
deep
for
in
those
days
was
first
seen
low
and
black
beside
the
mast
the
strange
and
neath
their
stern
revolv
the
twisted
fan
many
i
knew
as
soon
as
i
might
scan
the
heavy
the
bright
the
and
and
could
name
aright
others
that
i
remember
now
no
more
but
chief
her
blue
flag
flying
at
the
fore
with
fighting
guns
a
hundred
thirty
and
one
the
admiral
ship
duke
of
whereon
sail
george
who
in
her
gig
had
flown
the
silken
ensign
by
our
sisters
sewn
the
iron
duke
himself
whose
soldier
fame
to
england
proudest
ship
had
given
her
name
and
whose
white
hairs
in
this
my
earliest
scene
had
scarce
more
honour
than
accustom
been
was
two
years
since
to
his
last
haven
past
i
had
seen
his
to
fall
one
morn
as
i
sat
looking
on
the
sea
when
thus
all
england
grief
came
first
to
me
who
hold
my
childhood
favour
that
i
knew
so
well
the
face
that
won
at
waterloo
but
now
is
other
wars
and
other
men
the
year
that
napier
sail
my
years
were
ten
yea
and
new
homes
and
loves
my
heart
hath
found
a
priest
has
there
usurped
the
ivied
mound
the
bell
that
call
to
horse
calls
now
to
prayers
and
silent
nuns
tread
the
familiar
stairs
within
the
walls
that
old
outlaw
the
roman
wolf
scratches
with
privy
paw
o
love
i
complain
complain
of
thee
often
because
thou
dost
soften
my
being
to
pain
thou
makest
me
fear
the
mind
that
createth
that
loves
not
nor
hateth
in
justice
austere
who
ere
he
make
one
with
millions
toyeth
and
lightly
destroyeth
is
begun
an
not
for
thee
my
glorious
passion
my
heart
i
could
fashion
to
sternness
as
he
but
thee
love
he
made
lest
man
should
defy
him
connive
and
outvie
him
and
not
be
afraid
nay
thee
love
he
gave
his
terrors
to
cover
and
turn
to
a
lover
his
insolent
slave
the
south
wind
the
south
wind
rose
at
dusk
of
the
winter
day
the
warm
breath
of
the
western
sea
circling
wrapp
the
isle
with
his
cloke
of
cloud
and
it
now
reach
even
to
me
at
dusk
of
the
day
and
moan
in
the
branches
aloud
while
here
and
there
in
patches
of
dark
space
a
star
shone
forth
from
its
heavenly
place
as
a
spark
that
is
borne
in
the
smoky
chase
and
looking
up
there
fell
on
my
face
could
it
be
drops
of
rain
soft
as
the
wind
that
fell
on
my
face
gossamers
light
as
threads
of
the
summer
dawn
suck
by
the
sun
from
midmost
calms
of
the
main
from
groves
of
coral
islands
secretly
drawn
half
the
round
of
earth
to
be
driven
now
to
fall
on
my
face
in
silky
skeins
spun
from
the
mists
of
heaven
who
art
thou
in
wind
and
darkness
and
soft
rain
thyself
that
robest
that
bendest
in
sighing
pines
to
whisper
thy
truth
that
usest
for
signs
a
hurried
glimpse
of
the
moon
the
glance
of
a
star
in
the
rifted
sky
who
art
thou
that
with
thee
i
woo
and
am
wooed
that
robing
thyself
in
darkness
and
soft
rain
choosest
my
chosen
solitude
coming
so
far
to
tell
thy
secret
again
as
a
mother
her
child
in
her
folding
arm
of
a
winter
night
by
a
flickering
fire
telleth
the
same
tale
and
with
gentle
voice
and
i
never
tire
so
imperceptibly
changeth
the
charm
as
love
on
buried
ecstasy
buildeth
his
tower
like
as
the
stem
that
beareth
the
flower
by
trembling
is
knit
to
power
ah
long
ago
in
thy
first
rapture
i
renounced
my
lot
the
vanity
the
despondency
and
the
woe
and
seeking
thee
to
know
well
was
for
me
and
evermore
i
am
thine
i
know
not
what
for
me
thou
seekest
ever
me
wondering
a
day
in
the
eternal
alternations
me
free
for
a
stolen
moment
of
chance
to
dream
a
beautiful
dream
in
the
everlasting
dance
of
speechless
worlds
the
unsearchable
scheme
to
me
thou
findest
the
way
me
and
i
have
found
my
dream
to
share
still
with
thy
charm
encircling
even
to
me
and
my
love
in
darkness
and
soft
rain
under
the
sighing
pines
thou
comest
again
and
staying
our
speech
with
mystery
of
delight
of
the
kiss
that
i
give
a
wonder
thou
makest
and
the
kiss
that
i
take
thou
takest
i
climb
the
mossy
bank
of
the
glade
my
love
awaiteth
me
in
the
shade
she
holdeth
a
book
that
she
never
heedeth
in
goddës
work
her
spirit
readeth
she
is
all
to
me
and
i
to
her
when
we
embrace
the
stars
confer
o
my
love
from
beyond
the
sky
i
am
calling
thy
heart
and
who
but
i
fresh
as
love
is
the
breeze
of
june
in
the
dappled
shade
of
the
summer
noon
catullus
throwing
his
heart
away
gave
fewer
kisses
every
day
heracleitus
spending
his
youth
in
search
of
wisdom
had
less
of
truth
flame
of
fire
was
the
poet
desire
the
thinker
found
that
life
was
fire
o
my
love
my
song
is
done
my
kiss
hath
both
their
fires
in
one
to
my
love
i
whisper
and
say
knowest
thou
why
i
love
thee
nay
nay
she
saith
o
tell
me
when
in
her
ear
the
secret
i
tell
she
smileth
with
joy
incredible
ha
she
is
vain
o
nay
then
tell
us
nay
o
nay
but
this
is
in
my
heart
that
love
is
nature
perfect
art
and
man
hath
got
his
fancy
hence
to
clothe
his
thought
in
forms
of
sense
fair
are
thy
works
o
man
and
fair
thy
dreams
of
soul
in
garments
rare
beautiful
past
compare
yea
godlike
when
thou
hast
the
skill
to
steal
a
stir
of
the
heavenly
thrill
but
o
have
care
have
care
is
envious
even
to
dare
and
many
a
fiend
is
watching
well
to
flush
thy
reed
with
the
fire
of
hell
my
delight
and
thy
delight
walking
like
two
angels
white
in
the
gardens
of
the
night
my
desire
and
thy
desire
twining
to
a
tongue
of
fire
leaping
live
and
laughing
higher
thro
the
everlasting
strife
in
the
mystery
of
life
love
from
whom
the
world
begun
hath
the
secret
of
the
sun
love
can
tell
and
love
alone
whence
the
million
stars
were
strewn
why
each
atom
knows
its
own
how
in
spite
of
woe
and
death
gay
is
life
and
sweet
is
breath
this
he
taught
us
this
we
knew
happy
in
his
science
true
hand
in
hand
as
we
stood
neath
the
shadows
of
the
wood
heart
to
heart
as
we
lay
in
the
dawning
of
the
day
septuagesima
now
all
the
windows
with
frost
are
blinded
as
punctual
day
with
greedy
smile
lifts
like
a
cyclops
his
ruddy
eyeball
over
the
isle
in
an
hour
is
paled
in
an
hour
ascended
a
dazzling
light
in
the
cloudless
grey
steel
is
the
ice
the
snow
unblended
is
trod
to
dust
on
the
white
highway
the
lambkins
frisk
the
shepherd
is
melting
drink
for
the
ewes
with
a
fire
of
straw
the
red
flames
leap
at
the
wild
air
pelting
bitterly
thro
the
leafless
shaw
around
from
many
a
village
steeple
the
hum
over
the
snow
i
give
a
blessing
to
parson
and
people
across
the
fields
as
away
i
go
over
the
hills
and
over
the
meadows
gay
is
my
way
till
day
be
done
blue
as
the
heaven
are
all
the
shadows
and
every
light
is
gold
in
the
sun
the
sea
keeps
not
the
sabbath
day
his
waves
come
rolling
evermore
his
noisy
toil
grindeth
the
shore
and
all
the
cliff
is
drencht
with
spray
here
as
we
sit
my
love
and
i
under
the
pine
upon
the
hill
the
sadness
of
the
clouded
sky
the
bitter
wind
the
gloomy
roar
the
seamew
melancholy
cry
with
loving
fancy
suit
but
we
talk
of
moons
and
cooling
suns
of
geologic
time
and
tide
the
eternal
sluggards
that
abide
while
our
fair
love
so
swiftly
runs
of
nature
that
doth
half
consent
that
man
should
guess
her
dreary
scheme
lest
he
should
live
too
well
content
in
his
fair
house
of
mirth
and
dream
whose
labour
irks
his
ageing
heart
his
heart
that
wearies
of
desire
being
so
fugitive
a
part
of
what
so
slowly
must
expire
she
in
her
agelong
toil
and
care
persistent
wearies
not
nor
stays
mocking
alike
hope
and
despair
ah
but
she
too
can
mock
our
praise
enchanted
on
her
brighter
days
days
that
the
thought
of
grief
refuse
days
that
are
one
with
human
art
worthy
of
the
virgilian
muse
fit
for
the
gaiety
of
mozart
riding
adown
the
country
lanes
one
day
in
spring
heavy
at
heart
with
all
the
pains
of
man
imagining
the
mist
was
not
yet
melted
quite
into
the
sky
the
small
round
sun
was
dazzling
white
the
merry
larks
sang
high
the
grassy
northern
slopes
were
laid
in
sparkling
dew
out
of
the
shade
turning
from
sleep
anew
deep
in
the
sunny
vale
a
burn
ran
with
the
lane
with
ivy
moss
and
fern
it
laughed
in
joyful
strain
and
primroses
shot
long
and
lush
their
cluster
cream
robin
and
wren
and
amorous
thrush
carol
above
the
stream
the
stillness
of
the
lenten
air
call
into
sound
the
motions
of
all
life
that
were
in
field
and
farm
around
so
fair
it
was
so
sweet
and
bright
the
jocund
spring
awoke
in
me
the
old
delight
of
man
imagining
riding
adown
the
country
lanes
the
larks
sang
o
heart
for
all
thy
griefs
and
pains
thou
shalt
be
loth
to
die
pater
filio
sense
with
keenest
edge
unusèd
yet
unsteel
by
scathing
fire
lovely
feet
as
yet
unbruisèd
on
the
ways
of
dark
desire
sweetest
hope
that
lookest
smiling
the
wilderness
defiling
why
such
beauty
to
be
blighted
by
the
swarm
of
foul
destruction
why
such
innocence
delighted
when
sin
stalks
to
thy
seduction
all
the
litanies
chaunted
shall
not
keep
thy
faith
undaunted
i
have
pray
the
sainted
morning
to
unclasp
her
hands
to
hold
thee
from
resignful
eve
adorning
a
robe
of
peace
to
enfold
thee
with
all
charms
of
man
contriving
arm
thee
for
thy
lonely
striving
me
too
once
unthinking
nature
whence
love
timeless
mockery
took
me
fashion
so
divine
a
creature
yea
and
like
a
beast
forsook
me
i
forgave
but
tell
the
measure
of
her
crime
in
thee
my
treasure
november
the
lonely
season
in
lonely
lands
when
fled
are
half
the
birds
and
mists
lie
low
and
the
sun
is
rarely
seen
nor
strayeth
far
from
his
bed
the
short
days
pass
unwelcomed
one
by
one
out
by
the
ricks
the
mantled
engine
stands
crestfallen
deserted
for
now
all
hands
are
told
to
the
plough
and
ere
it
is
dawn
appear
the
teams
following
and
crossing
far
and
near
as
hour
by
hour
they
broaden
the
brown
bands
of
the
striped
fields
and
behind
them
firk
and
prance
the
heavy
rooks
and
daws
dance
as
awhile
surmounting
a
crest
in
sharp
outline
a
miniature
of
toil
a
gem
design
they
are
pictured
horses
and
men
or
now
near
by
above
the
lane
they
shout
lifting
the
share
by
the
trim
hedgerow
bloom
with
purple
air
where
under
the
thorns
dead
leaves
in
huddle
lie
packed
by
the
gales
of
autumn
and
in
and
out
the
small
wrens
glide
with
a
happy
note
of
cheer
and
yellow
amorets
flutter
above
and
about
gay
familiar
in
fear
and
now
if
the
night
shall
be
cold
across
the
sky
linnets
and
twites
in
small
flocks
all
the
afternoon
to
the
gardens
fly
from
hurrying
to
gain
the
shelter
of
american
rhododendron
or
and
here
and
there
near
chilly
setting
of
sun
in
an
isolated
tree
a
congregation
of
starlings
chatter
and
chide
thickset
as
summer
leaves
in
garrulous
quarrel
suddenly
they
hush
as
one
the
tree
top
springs
and
off
with
a
whirr
of
wings
they
fly
by
the
score
to
the
and
there
with
myriads
more
dispute
for
the
roosts
and
from
the
unseen
nation
a
babel
of
tongues
like
running
water
unceasing
makes
live
the
wood
the
flocking
cries
increasing
wrangling
discordantly
incessantly
while
falls
the
night
on
them
the
long
dark
night
that
lengthens
slow
deepening
with
winter
to
starve
grass
and
tree
and
soon
to
bury
in
snow
the
earth
that
sleeping
her
frozen
stole
shall
dream
a
dream
crept
from
the
sunless
pole
of
how
her
end
shall
be
winter
nightfall
the
day
begins
to
droop
its
course
is
done
but
nothing
tells
the
place
of
the
setting
sun
the
hazy
darkness
deepens
and
up
the
lane
you
may
hear
but
can
not
see
the
homing
wain
an
engine
pants
and
hums
in
the
farm
hard
by
its
lowering
smoke
is
lost
in
the
lowering
sky
the
soaking
branches
drip
and
all
night
through
the
dropping
will
not
cease
in
the
avenue
a
tall
man
there
in
the
house
must
keep
his
chair
he
knows
he
will
never
again
breathe
the
spring
air
his
heart
is
worn
with
work
he
is
giddy
and
sick
if
he
rise
to
go
as
far
as
the
nearest
rick
he
thinks
of
his
morn
of
life
his
hale
strong
years
and
braves
as
he
may
the
night
of
darkness
and
tears
since
we
loved
the
earth
that
shook
as
we
kissed
fresh
beauty
took
love
hath
been
as
poets
paint
life
as
heaven
is
to
a
saint
all
my
joys
my
hope
excel
all
my
work
hath
prosper
well
all
my
songs
have
happy
been
o
my
love
my
life
my
queen
when
death
to
either
shall
come
i
pray
it
be
first
to
me
be
happy
as
ever
at
home
if
so
as
i
wish
it
be
possess
thy
heart
my
own
and
sing
to
the
child
on
thy
knee
or
read
to
thyself
alone
the
songs
that
i
made
for
thee
wishes
i
wish
to
sing
thy
grace
but
nought
found
upon
earth
that
could
compare
some
day
maybe
in
heaven
i
thought
if
i
should
win
the
welcome
there
there
might
i
make
thee
many
a
song
but
now
it
is
enough
to
say
i
have
done
our
life
the
wrong
of
wishing
for
a
happier
day
a
love
lyric
why
art
thou
sad
my
dearest
what
terror
is
it
thou
fearest
braver
who
art
than
i
the
fiend
to
defy
why
art
thou
sad
my
dearest
and
why
in
tears
appearest
closer
than
i
that
wert
at
hiding
thy
hurt
why
art
thou
sad
my
dearest
since
now
my
voice
thou
hearest
who
with
a
kiss
restore
thy
valour
of
yore
ερως
why
hast
thou
nothing
in
thy
face
thou
idol
of
the
human
race
thou
tyrant
of
the
human
heart
the
flower
of
lovely
youth
that
art
yea
and
that
standest
in
thy
youth
an
image
of
eternal
truth
with
thy
exuberant
flesh
so
fair
that
only
pheidias
might
compare
ere
from
his
chaste
marmoreal
form
time
had
decayed
the
colours
warm
like
to
his
gods
in
thy
proud
dress
thy
starry
sheen
of
nakedness
surely
thy
body
is
thy
mind
for
in
thy
face
is
nought
to
find
only
thy
soft
unchristen
smile
that
shadows
neither
love
nor
guile
but
shameless
will
and
power
immense
in
secret
sensuous
innocence
o
king
of
joy
what
is
thy
thought
i
dream
thou
knowest
it
is
nought
and
wouldst
in
darkness
come
but
thou
makest
the
light
thou
go
ah
yet
no
victim
of
thy
grace
none
who
long
for
thy
embrace
hath
cared
to
look
upon
thy
face
the
fair
brass
an
effigy
of
brass
trodden
by
careless
feet
of
worshippers
that
pass
beautiful
and
complete
lieth
in
the
sombre
aisle
of
this
old
church
unwreckt
and
still
from
modern
style
shielded
by
kind
neglect
it
shows
a
warrior
arm
across
his
iron
breast
his
hands
by
death
are
to
leave
his
sword
at
rest
wherewith
he
led
his
men
and
smote
to
hell
the
astonisht
saracen
nor
doubted
he
did
well
would
wé
could
teach
our
sons
his
trust
in
face
of
doom
or
give
our
bravest
ones
a
comparable
tomb
such
as
to
look
on
shrives
the
heart
of
half
its
care
so
in
each
line
survives
the
spirit
that
made
it
fair
so
fair
the
characters
with
which
the
dusty
scroll
that
tells
his
title
stirs
a
requiem
for
his
soul
yet
dearer
far
to
me
and
brave
as
he
are
they
who
fight
by
land
and
sea
for
england
at
this
day
whose
vile
memorials
in
mournful
marbles
gilt
deface
the
beauteous
walls
by
growing
glory
built
heirs
of
our
antique
shrines
sires
of
our
future
fame
whose
starry
honour
shines

many

deathful

the

sky
looks
dark
and
further
from
the
earth
than
when
you
gaze
at
it
on
high
at
mid
of
night
if
one
be
there
so
say
the
people
of
the
hill
a
fearful
shriek
of
death
is
heard
one
sudden
scream
both
loud
and
shrill
and
some
have
seen
on
stilly
nights
and
when
the
moon
was
clear
and
round
bubbles
which
to
the
surface
swam
and
burst
as
if
they
held
the
was
in
the
days
ere
hapless
charles
losing
his
crown
had
lost
his
head
this
tale
is
told
of
him
who
kept
the
inn
upon
the
watershed
he
was
a
lowbred
ruin
man
whom
lawless
times
set
free
from
fear
one
evening
to
his
house
there
rode
a
young
and
gentle
cavalier
with
curling
hair
and
linen
fair
and
sword
he
went
the
horse
he
rode
he
had
ridden
far
and
he
was
with
his
journey
spent
he
asked
a
lodging
for
the
night
his
valise
from
his
steed
unbound
he
let
none
bear
it
but
himself
and
set
it
by
him
on
the
ground
gold
or
jewels
thought
the
host
carrying
south
to
find
the
king
he
chattered
many
a
loyal
word
and
scraps
of
royal
airs
gan
sing
his
guest
thereat
grew
more
at
ease
and
his
wine
he
gave
a
toast
but
little
ate
and
to
his
room
carried
his
sack
behind
the
host
rest
you
well
the
host
he
said
but
of
his
wish
the
word
fell
wide
nor
did
he
now
forget
his
son
who
fell
in
fight
by
cromwell
side
revenge
and
poverty
have
brought
full
gentler
heart
than
his
to
crime
and
he
was
one
by
nature
rude
born
to
foul
deeds
at
any
time
with
unshod
feet
at
dead
of
night
in
stealth
he
to
the
crept
lantern
and
dagger
in
his
hand
and
stabbed
his
victim
while
he
slept
but
as
he
struck
a
scream
there
came
a
fearful
scream
so
loud
and
shrill
he
whelm
the
face
with
pillows
and
lean
till
all
had
long
been
still
then
to
the
face
the
flame
he
held
to
see
there
should
no
life
remain
when
lo
his
brutal
heart
was
quell
was
a
fair
woman
he
had
slain
the
tan
upon
her
face
was
paint
the
manly
hair
was
torn
away
soft
was
the
breast
that
he
had
pierced
beautiful
in
her
death
she
lay
his
was
no
heart
to
faint
at
crime
tho
half
he
wished
the
deed
undone
he
pulled
the
valise
from
the
bed
to
find
what
booty
he
had
won
he
cut
the
straps
and
pushed
within
his
murderous
fingers
to
their
theft
a
deathly
sweat
came
his
brow
he
had
no
sense
nor
meaning
left
he
touched
not
gold
it
was
not
cold
it
was
not
hard
it
felt
like
flesh
he
drew
out
by
the
curling
hair
a
young
man
head
and
murder
fresh
a
young
man
head
cut
by
the
neck
but
what
was
dreader
still
to
see
her
whom
he
had
slain
he
saw
again
the
twain
were
like
as
like
can
be
brother
and
sister
if
they
were
both
in
one
shroud
they
now
were
wound
across
his
back
and
down
the
stair
out
of
the
house
without
a
sound
he
made
his
way
unto
the
tarn
the
night
was
dark
and
still
and
dank
the
ripple
chuckling
neath
the
boat
laughed
as
he
drew
it
to
the
bank
upon
the
bottom
of
the
boat
he
laid
his
burden
flat
and
low
and
on
them
laid
the
square
sandstones
that
round
about
the
margin
go
stone
upon
stone
he
weighed
them
down
until
the
boat
would
hold
no
more
the
freeboard
now
was
scarce
an
inch
he
stripp
his
clothes
and
push
from
shore
all
naked
to
the
middle
pool
he
swam
behind
in
the
dark
night
and
there
he
let
the
water
in
and
sank
his
terror
out
of
sight
he
swam
ashore
and
donn
his
dress
and
scraped
his
bloody
fingers
clean
ran
home
and
on
his
victim
steed
mounted
and
never
more
was
seen
but
to
a
comrade
ere
he
died
he
told
his
story
guess
of
none
so
from
his
lips
the
crime
returned
to
haunt
the
spot
where
it
was
done
the

not

from

rivalries
of
men
from
strife
from
arms
from
woman
love
and
toil
of
life
now
of
his
lone
abode
i
will
unfold
what
there
i
saw
or
was
by
others
told
there
is
in
truth
a
temple
on
the
isle
therein
a
wooden
statue
of
rude
style
and
workmanship
antique
with
helm
of
lead
else
all
is
desert
uninhabited
only
a
few
goats
browse
the
rocks
and
oft
the
stragglers
of
their
starving
flocks
are
caught
and
sacrificed
by
whoever
of
chance
or
purpose
hither
fare
about
the
fence
lie
strewn
their
bleaching
bones
but
in
the
temple
jewels
and
precious
stones
upheapt
with
golden
rings
and
vials
lie
thankofferings
to
achilles
and
thereby
written
or
scratch
upon
the
walls
in
view
inscriptions
with
the
givers
names
thereto
some
in
romaic
character
some
greek
as
each
man
in
the
tongue
that
he
might
speak
wrote
verse
of
praise
or
prayer
for
good
to
come
to
achilles
most
but
to
patroclus
some
for
those
who
strongly
would
achilles
move
approach
him
by
the
pathway
of
his
love
thousands
of
birds
frequent
the
sheltering
shrine
the
dippers
and
the
swimmers
of
the
brine
and
gull
and
diving
cormorant
fishers
that
on
the
high
cliff
make
their
haunt
sheer
inaccessible
and
sun
themselves
huddled
arow
upon
the
narrow
shelves
and
surely
no
like
wonder
hath
been
as
that
such
birds
should
keep
the
temple
clean
but
thus
they
do
at
earliest
dawn
of
day
they
flock
to
sea
and
in
the
waters
play
and
when
they
well
have
wet
their
plumage
light
back
to
the
sanctuary
they
take
flight
splashing
the
walls
and
columns
with
fresh
brine
till
all
the
stone
doth
fairly
drip
and
shine
when
off
again
they
skim
asea
for
more
and
soon
returning
sprinkle
steps
and
floor
and
sweep
all
cleanly
with
their
wings
from
other
men
i
have
learnt
further
things
if
any
of
free
purpose
thus
they
tell
sail
hither
to
consult
the
oracle
for
oracle
there
was
they
sacrificed
such
victims
as
they
brought
if
such
sufficed
and
some
they
slew
some
to
the
god
set
free
but
they
who
driven
from
their
course
at
sea
chanced
on
the
isle
took
of
the
goats
thereon
and
pray
achilles
to
accept
his
own
then
made
they
a
gift
and
when
they
had
offer
once
if
to
their
question
there
was
no
response
they
added
to
the
gift
and
asked
again
yea
twice
and
more
until
the
god
should
deign
answer
to
give
their
offering
they
renew
whereby
great
riches
to
the
shrine
ensued
and
when
both
sacrifice
and
gifts
were
made
they
worship
at
the
shrine
and
as
they
sailors
aver
that
often
hath
been
seen
a
man
like
to
a

recollections
of
solitude
an
elegy
ended
are
many
days
and
now
but
few
remain
since
therefore
it
is
happy
and
true
that
memoried
joys
keep
ever
their
delight
like
steadfast
stars
in
the
blue
vault
of
night
while
hours
of
pain
among
those
heavenly
spheres
like
falling
meteors
the
martyr
tears
dart
their
long
trails
at
random
and
anon
ere
we
exclaim
pass
and
for
aye
are
gone
therefore
my
heedy
thought
will
oft
restore
the
long
days
that
are
no
more
save
where
in
her
memorial
crypt
they
shine
spangling
the
silent
past
with
joy
divine
but
why
in
dream
of
this
enchanted
mood
should
all
my
boyhood
seem
a
solitude
good
reason
know
i
when
i
wander
there
in
that
transmuted
scene
why
all
is
fair
the
woods
as
when
in
holiday
of
spring
million
buds
burst
and
flowers
are
blossoming
the
meadows
deep
in
grass
the
fields
unshorn
in
beauty
of
the
multitudinous
corn
where
the
strait
alleys
hide
me
wall
between
high
bloomy
stalks
and
rustling
banners
green
the
gardens
too
in
dazzling
hues
with
wafted
scent
and
blazing
petals
strewn
the
orchards
reddening
thro
the
patient
hours
while
idle
autumn
in
his
mossy
bowers
inviteth
meditation
to
endear
the
sanctuaries
of
the
mellowing
year
and
every
spot
wherein
i
loved
to
stray
hath
borrowed
radiance
of
eternal
day
but
why
am
i
ever
alone
alone
here
in
the
corner
of
a
field
my
throne
now
in
the
branching
chair
of
some
tall
tree
drinking
the
gale
in
liberty
or
to
the
seashore
wandered
in
the
sun
to
watch
the
fateful
waves
break
one
by
one
or
if
on
basking
downs
supine
i
lie
bathing
my
spirit
in
blue
calms
of
the
sky
or
to
the
river
bank
am
stolen
by
night
hearkening
unto
the
moonlit
ripple
bright
that
warbles
the
shallows
of
smooth
stone
why
should
my
memory
find
me
all
alone
when
i
had
such
companions
every
day
jocund
and
dear
glimpses
of
their
play
is
a
vast
solitude
wherein
i
see
only
myself
and
what
i
came
to
be
yet
never
think
dear
spirits
if
now
ye
may
remember
aught
of
that
brief
earthly
day
ere
ye
the
mournful
stygian
river
crost
from
our
familiar
home
too
early
lost
o
never
think
that
i
your
tears
forget
or
that
i
loved
not
well
or
love
not
yet
nor
ye
who
held
my
heart
in
passion
chain
as
kings
and
queens
succeed
in
glorious
reign
when
as
a
man
i
made
you
to
outvie
god
work
and
as
a
god
then
set
you
by
among
the
sainted
throng
in
holiest
shrine
of
mythic
creed
and
poetry
divine
true
was
my
faith
and
still
your
loves
endure
the
jewels
of
my
fancy
bright
and
pure
nor
only
in
fair
places
do
i
see
the
picture
fair
now
it
has
ceased
to
be
for
fate
once
led
me
and
myself
some
days
did
i
devote

dull
laborious
ways
by
soaring
thought
detained
to
tread
full
low
yea
might
i
say
unbeauteous
paths
of
woe
and
dreary
abodes
had
not
my
youthful
sprite
hallow
each
nook
with
legends
of
delight
ah
that
smoky
town
who
looketh
now
by
winter
sunset
from
the
dark
under
the
dying
trees
exultantly
nursing
the
sting
of
human
tragedy
or
in
that
little
room
upstair
so
high
where
london
roofs
in
thickest
huddle
lie
who
now
returns
at
evening
to
entice
to

fireside
the
joys
of
paradise
once
sacred
was
that
hearth
and
bright
the
air
the
flame
of
man
redemption
flickered
there
in

deathless

have
thrilled

so

within

springeth
a
bloom
of
the

her
vision
bringeth
between

my

millicent
thou
dimpled
millicent
of
merry
guesses
and
tall
tossing
thy
wayward

what
mystery
of
the
heart
can
so
surprise
the
mirth
and
music
of
thy
brimming
eyes
thou
knowest
not
and
diest
to
learn
the
mortal
secret
that
doth
in
thee
burn
with
look
imploring
you
love
me
tell
what
is
it
in
me
that
you
love
so
well
and
suddenly
thou
stakest
all
thy
charms
and
leapest
on
me
and
in
thy
circling
arms
when
almost
stifled
with
their
wild
embrace
i
feel
thy
hot
tears
sheltering
on
my
face
vivamus
when
thou
didst
give
thy
love
to
me
asking
no
more
of
gods
or

i
vow
i
would
contented
be
if
fate
should
grant
us
summers
ten
but
now
that
twice
the
term
is
sped
and
ever
young
my
heart
and
gay
i
fear
the
words
that
then
i
said
and
turn
my
face
from
fate
away
to
bid
thee
happily
i
have
no
hope
that
i
can
see
no
way
that
i
shall
bravely
die
unless
i
give
my
life
for
thee
one
grief
of
thine
if
truth
be
confest
was
joy
to
me
for
it
drave
to
my
breast
thee
to
my
heart
to
find
thy
rest
how
long
it
was
i
never
shall
know
i
watcht
the
earth
so
stately
and
slow
and
the
ancient
things
that
waste
and
grow
but
now
for
me
what
speed
devours
our
heavenly
life
our
brilliant
hours
how
fast
they
fly
the
stars
and
flowers
in
still
midsummer
night
when
the
moon
is
late
and
the
stars
all
watery
and
white
for
her
coming
wait
a
spirit
whose
eyes
are
possest
by
wonder
new
passeth
her
arms
upon
her
breast
enwrapt
from
the
dew
in
a
raiment
of

fold
with

of

embroidery
of

the

is
that
when
so
much
froth
and
scum
float
down
the
stream
of
time
as
bacon
saith
what
is
that
for
deliverance
from
the
death
could
any
sober
man
be
proud
to
hold
a
lease
of
common
talk
or
die
consoled
for
thinking
that
on
lips
of
fools
to
come
he
live
with
pontius
pilate
and
tom
thumb
that
were
more
like
eternal
punishment
the
true
fool
paradise
by
all
consent
béranger
thought
to
set
a
crown
on
merit
a
man
merit
and
to
crown
it
in
voltaire
the
modest
eye
the
gentle
fearless
heart
the
mouth
of
peace
and
truth
the
angelic
spirit
why
arouet
was
with
the
leaven
of
which
the
little
flock
was
bid
beware
his
very
ambition
was
to
play
a
part
indifferent
whether
he
did
wrong
or
right
so
he
won
credit
eager
to
deny
a
lie
that
failed
by
adding
lie
to
lie
repaying
evil
unto
a
fount
of
slander
flattery
and
spite
vain
irritable
true
but
to
his
face
of
mockery
and
mischievous
grimace
a
monkey
of
the
schools
the
saints
despair
b
yet
for
his
voice
half
europe
stood
at
pause
to
hear
and
when
he
spoke
rang
with
applause
a
granted
he
was
a
wonder
of
his
kind
there
is
a
devilish
mockery
in
things
which
only
a
born
devil
can
enjoy
true
banter
is
of
melancholy
mind
akin
to
madness
thus
must
shakespeare
toy
with
hamlet
reason
ere
his
fine
art
dare
push
his
relentless
humour
to
the
quick
and
so
his
mortal
thrusts
pierce
not
the
skin
but
for
the
superficial
bickerings
that
poison
life
and
never
seem
to
prick
the
reasonable
educated
grin
truly
no
wag
is
equal
to
voltaire
his
ripple
wide
and
light
has
nigh
the
force
of
nature
to
compare
is
like
the
ocean
when
the
sky
is
bright
and
the
cold
tickles
with
surprise
the
briny
levels
of
the
infinite
sea
shall
we
conclude
his
merit
was
his
wit
his
magic
art
and
versatility
b
and
think
of
those
foredoom
in
dante
pit
who
sunk
at
bottom
of
the
loathly
slough
made
the
black
mud
with
their
sighs
and
all
because
they
were
unkind
to
mirth
and
went
with
smoky
heart
and
gloomy
brow
the
while
they
lived
upon
the
pleasant
earth
in
the
sweet
air
that
rallies
to
the
sun
and
so
much
as
smiled
or
gave
god
thanks
surely
a
sparkle
of
the
frenchman
fun
had
rescued
all
their
souls
i
think
i
see
the
deity
who
in
this
heaven
abides
bon
holding
both
his
aching
sides
with
radiant
face
of
pan
ruddy
and
hairy
give
him
his
famous
whistles
and
and
then
present
him
to
alighieri
nay
the
frenchman
and
the
florentine
i
ask
no
truce
grave
dante
weaving
well
his
thought
into
a
song
divine
drawing
high
poetry
from
heaven
and
hell
and
him
who
lightly
mockt
at
all
in
turn
a
it
follow
from
his
mundane
thought
of
art
that
he
contemn
religion
his
concern
was
comfort
taste
and
wit
he
had
no
heart
for
man
attempt
to
build
and
beautify
his
home
in
nature
so
he
set
all
by
that
wisdom
had
evolved
with
purpose
kind
stamped
it
as
folly
or
as
fraud
attacked
never
discerning
how
his
callow
zest
was
impiously
defiling
his
own
nest
whereas
the
least
philosophy
may
find
the
truths
are
the
ideas
the
sole
fact
is
the
long
story
of
man
growing
mind
b
upon
your
thistle
now
i
see
my
fig
béranger
thought
of
voltaire
as
a
seer
a
john
baptist
in
a
wig
a
herald
of
that
furious
of
words
and
blood
that
made
the
nations
fear
when
sickening
france
adulterously
with
virtue
and
went
mad
conceiving
wind
he
ranks
him
with
those
captains
of
reform
luther
and
calvin
who
they
taught
led
folk
from
superstition
to
free
thought
a
they
did
but
whence
or
whither
led
voltaire
the
steward
with
fifty
talents
given
in
charge
who
spent
them
on
himself
and
liv
at
large
his
only
virtue
that
he
did
not
hide
the
pounds
but
squander
them
to
serve
his
pride
his
praise
that
cunning
in
his
generation
he
of
the
heavenly
treasure
did
not
spare
to
win
himself
an
earthly
habitation
b
deny
him
not
this
laurel
nor
to
france
the
apostolate
of
modern
tolerance
their
theseus
he
who
slew
the
minotaur
the
dragon
persecution
in
which
war
he
tipp
the
shafts
that
made
the
devil
bleed
and
won
a
victory
that
hath
overcome
many
misdoings
in
a
deed
and
more
i
think
the
mind
of
christ
revealing
yea
more
of
and
human
feeling
than
all
the
creeds
and
bulls
of
christendom
a
yet
was
he
only
one
of
them
that
slew
the
fiend
had
taken
a
deadly
wound
from
bayle
and
did
he
to
see
his
kingdom
robespierre
or
raise
his
head
anew
nay
voltaire
teaching
never
cured
the
heart
the
lack
of
human
feeling
blots
his
art
when
most
his
phrase
with
indignation
burns
still
to
the
gallery
his
face
he
turns
b
you
bear
him
hard
men
are
of
common
stuff
each
hath
some
fault
and
he
had
faults
enough
but
of
all
slanderers
that
ever
were
a
virtuous
critic
is
the
most
unfair
in
greatness
ever
is
some
good
to
see
and
what
is
character
unless
it
be
the
colour
of
persistent
qualities
that
like
a
ground
in
painting
balances
all
hues
and
forms
combining
with
one
tone
whatever
lights
or
shades
are
on
it
thrown
now
voltaire
had
of
nature
a
rich
ground
two
virtues
rarely
in
conjunction
found
industry
which
no
pedant
could
excel
he
matched
with
gaiety
inexhaustible
and
with
heroic
courage
held
these
fast
as
sailors
nail
their
colours
to
the
mast
with
ruling
excellence
atoning
all
though
for
the
rest
he
still
for
praise
may
call
prudent
to
gain
as
generous
to
share
superflu
chose
si
to
most
a
rare
companion
above
scorn
to
not
a
few
a
kind
devoted
friend
through
his
long
battling
life
which
in
the
end
he
strove
with
good
works
richly
to
adorn
i
have
admired
and
why
should
i
abuse
a
man
who
can
so
long
and
well
amuse
a
to
some
parisian
art
there
this
objection
is
mediocrity
pushed
to
perfection
b
not
say
i
ye
shall
not
be
judged
a
let
me
say
men
if
ye
would
be
praised
let
your
unwholesome
flattery
flow
ungrudged
and
with
ungrudging
measure
shall
men
pour
their
stifling
homage
back
till
ye
be
crazed
and
sane
men
humour
you
as
fools
past
cure
but
these
wise
maxims
deal
not
with
the
dead
is
by
example
that
the
young
are
led
and
judgement
owes
its
kindness
but
to
them
nor
will
i
praise
call
you
me
hard
or
nice
one
that
degraded
art
and
varnished
vice
they
that
praise
ill
thereby
themselves
condemn
béranger
could
not
praise
a
few
are
who
can
not
he
if
ever
he
assay
to
impart
a
title
loftier
than
his
own
renown
native
irreverence
defied
his
art
his
fingers
soil
the
lustre
of
his
crown
here
he
adored
what
he
was
envious
of
the
vogue
and
dazzling
fashion
of
the
man
but
man
true
praise
the
poet
praise
is
love
b
and
that
perhaps
was
hardly
his
affair
pray
now
what
set
you
talking
of
voltaire
a
this
only
that
in
weeding
out
my
shelves
in
fatherly
regard
for
babes
upgrown
until
they
learn
to
garden
for
themselves
much
as
i
like
to
keep
my
sets
entire
when
i
came
out
to
you
i
had
just
thrown
three
of
his
precious
works
behind
the
fire
to
robert
burns
an
epistle
on
instinct
thou
art
a
poet
robbie
burns
master
of
words
and
witty
turns
of
lilting
songs
and
merry
yarns
drinking
and
kissing
there
much
in
all
thy
small
concerns
but
more
that
missing
the
wisdom
of
thy
common
sense
thy
honest
hate
of
vain
pretence
thy
love
and
wide
benevolence
full
often
lead
thee
where
feeling
is
its
own
defence
yet
while
i
read
thee
it
seems
but
chance
that
all
our
race
trod
not
the
path
of
thy
disgrace
and
living
freely
to
embrace
the
moment
pleasure
snatch
not
a
kiss
of

for
all
her
treasure
the

a
flowery
way
and
sovran
youth
in

heyday
hath
such
a
fashion
to
glorify
the
bragging
sway
of
sensual
passion
but
rakel
chance
and
fortune
blind
had
not
the
power

upon
a
way

by
strait
selection
of
pleasurable
ways
to
find
severe
perfection
for

not

she
ruled
it

attend
on
every
act
that
doth
amend
our
life
condition
is
therefore
not
end
but
its
fruition
beasts
that
inherited
delight
in
what
promoted
health
or
might
survived
their
cousins
in
the
fight
if
some
like
adam
prefer
the
wrong
tree
to
the
right
the
devil
had
so
when
man
reason
took
the
reins
she
found
that
she
was
saved
her
pains
she
had
but
to
approve
the
gains
of
agelong
inscience
and
spin
it
fresh
into
her
brains
as
moral
conscience
but
instinct
in
the
beasts
that
live
is
of
three
kinds
nature
did
give
to
man
three
shakings
in
her
sieve
the
first
is
racial
the
second
the
third
is
social
without
the
first
no
race
could
be
so
is
the
strongest
of
the
three
nay
of
such
forceful
tyranny
is
hard
to
attune
it
because
was
never
made
to
agree
to
serve
the
unit
art
will
not
picture
it
its
name
in
common
talk
is
utter
shame
and
yet
hath
reason
learn
to
tame
its
conflagration
into
a
sacramental
flame
of
consecration
those
hundred
thousand
years
ah
me
of
budding
soul
what
slow
degree
with
aim
so
dim
so
true
we
see
now
that
we
know
them
our
humble
ancestry
how
much
we
owe
them
while
with
the
savage
beasts
around
they
fought
at
odds
yet
underground
their
miserable
life
was
sound
their
loves
and
quarrels
did
well
th
ideal
bases
found
of
art
and
morals
one
prime
distinction
good
and
ill
was
all
their
notion
all
their
skill
but
unity
stands
next
to
nil
want
of
analysis
saved
them
from
doubts
that
wreck
the
will
with
pale
paralysis
in
vain
philosophers

our
pursuit
the

the

that

to
do

it

point

with
an
abstract
of
stone
prosody
as
there
by
daniel
review
march
quarterly
with
an
essay
on
the
virgilian
hexameter
these
experiments
in
quantitive
verse
were
made
in
fulfilment
of
a
promise
to
william
johnson
stone
that
i
would
some
day
test
his
theory
his
premature
death
converted
my
consent
into
a
serious
obligation
this
personal
explanation
is
due
to
myself
for
two
reasons
because
i
might
otherwise
appear
firstly
as
an
advocate
of
the
system
secondly
as
responsible
for
stone
determination
of
the
lengths
of
english
syllables
before
writing
quantitive
verse
it
is
necessary
to
learn
to
in
quantities
this
is
no
light
task
and
a
beginner
requires
fixed
rules
except
for
a
few
minor
details
which
i
had
disputed
with
stone
i
was
bound
to
take
his
rules
as
he
had
elaborated
them
and
it
was
not
until
i
had
made
some
progress
and
could
think
fairly
well
in
his
prosody
that
i
seriously
criticized
it
the
two
chief
errors
that
i
find
in
it
are
that
he
relied
too
much
on
the
quality
of
a
vowel
in
determining
its
syllabic
length
and
that
he
regarded
the
as
consonantal
in
quality
his
valuation
of
the
sound
is
doubtful
but
defensible
and
convenient
and
i
have
never
discarded
it
my
earlier
experiments
contain
therefore
a
good
many
quantities
and
these
where
they
could
not
be
very
easily
though
amended
i
have
left
and
marked
most
of
them
in
the
text
a
few
false
quantities
do
not
make
a
poem
less
readable
thus
a
long
mark
over
a
syllable
means
that
stone
reckoned
it
as
long
and
that
the
verse
requires
it
to
be
so
pronounced
but
that
i
regard
it
as
short
or
at
least
as
for
example
on
is
thus
written
of
all
accented
long
vowels
in
position
the
long
seems
perhaps
to
retain
its
quantity
best
but
there
is
evidence
that
tennyson
held
it
to
be
shortened
and
i
do
not
know
whether
it
might
be
an
exception
or
go
with
thĕory
pĭety
pŏetry
again
where
a
final
syllable
should
be
lengthened
or
not
shortened
by
position
but
lacks
its
consonantal
support
i
have
put
a
v
in
the
gap
these
weak
places
are
chiefly
due
to
my
accepting
stone
unchanging
valuation
of
my
emancipation
from
stone
rules
was
gradual
so
that
i
have
not
been
able
to
distinguish
definitely
my
earlier
experiments
from
the
later
in
which
the
quantities
are
such
as
i
have
now
come
to
approve
of
but
my
paraphrase
of
virgil
is
such
a
later
experiment
it
was
accompanied
in
the
by
a
long
examination
of
the
virgilian
hexameter
to
which
i
would
refer
any
one
who
is
interested
in
the
subject
in
these
english
hexameters
i
have
used
and
advocate
the
use
of
miltonic
elision
the
mark
in
the
text
shows
where
i
have
purposely
allowed
a
short
syllable
to
sustain
a
long
place
though
the
difficulty
of
adapting
our
english
syllables
to
the
greek
rules
is
very
great
and
even
deterrent
for
i
can
not
pretend
to
have
attained
to
an
absolutely
consistent
scheme
yet
the
experiments
that
i
have
made
reveal
a
vast
unexplored
field
of
delicate
and
expressive
rhythms
hitherto
unknown
in
our
poetry
and
this
amply
rewarded
me
for
my
friendly
undertaking

i
