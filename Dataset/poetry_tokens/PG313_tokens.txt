the

for

that

the
darkness
is
a
sullen
thing
and
they
the
children
of
the
night
seem
lost
in
fortune
winnowing
but
some
are
strong
and
some
are
weak
and
there
the
story
house
and
home
are
shut
from
countless
hearts
that
seek
that
will
never
come
and
if
there
be
no
other
life
and
if
there
be
no
other
chance
to
weigh
their
sorrow
and
their
strife
than
in
the
scales
of
circumstance
were
better
ere
the
sun
go
down
upon
the
first
day
we
embark
in
life
imbittered
sea
to
drown
than
sail
forever
in
the
dark
but
if
there
be
a
soul
on
earth
so
blinded
with
its
own
misuse
of
man
revealed
incessant
worth
or
worn
with
anguish
that
it
views
no
light
but
for
a
mortal
eye
no
rest
but
of
a
mortal
sleep
no
god
but
in
a
prophet
lie
no
faith
for
honest
doubt
to
keep
if
there
be
nothing
good
or
bad
but
chaos
for
a
soul
to
trust
god
counts
it
for
a
soul
gone
mad
and
if
god
be
god
he
is
just
and
if
god
be
god
he
is
love
and
though
the
dawn
be
still
so
dim
it
shows
us
we
have
played
enough
with
creeds
that
make
a
fiend
of
him
there
is
one
creed
and
only
one
that
glorifies
god
excellence
so
cherish
that
his
will
be
done
the
common
creed
of
common
sense
it
is
the
crimson
not
the
gray
that
charms
the
twilight
of
all
time
it
is
the
promise
of
the
day
that
makes
the
starry
sky
sublime
it
is
the
faith
within
the
fear
that
holds
us
to
the
life
we
curse
so
let
us
in
ourselves
revere
the
self
which
is
the
universe
let
us
the
children
of
the
night
put
off
the
cloak
that
hides
the
scar
let
us
be
children
of
the
light
and
tell
the
ages
what
we
are
three
quatrains
i
as
long
as
fame
imperious
music
rings
will
poets
mock
it
with
crowned
words
august
and
haggard
men
will
clamber
to
be
kings
as
long
as
glory
weighs
itself
in
dust
ii
drink
to
the
splendor
of
the
unfulfilled
nor
shudder
for
the
revels
that
are
done
the
wines
that
flushed
lucullus
are
all
spilled
the
strings
that
nero
fingered
are
all
gone
iii
we
can
not
crown
ourselves
with
everything
nor
can
we
coax
the
fates
for
us
to
quarrel
no
matter
what
we
are
or
what
we
sing
time
finds
a
withered
leaf
in
every
laurel
the
world
some
are
the
brothers
of
all
humankind
and
own
them
whatsoever
their
estate
and
some
for
sorrow
and
are
blind
with
enmity
for
man
unguarded
fate
for
some
there
is
a
music
all
day
long
like
flutes
in
paradise
they
are
so
glad
and
there
is
hell
eternal
of
curses
and
the
cries
of
men
gone
mad
some
say
the
scheme
with
love
stands
luminous
some
say
were
better
back
to
chaos
hurled
and
so
is
what
we
are
that
makes
for
us
the
measure
and
the
meaning
of
the
world
an
old
story
strange
that
i
did
not
know
him
then
that
friend
of
mine
i
did
not
even
show
him
then
one
friendly
sign
but
cursed
him
for
the
ways
he
had
to
make
me
see
my
envy
of
the
praise
he
had
for
praising
me
i
would
have
rid
the
earth
of
him
once
in
my
pride
i
never
knew
the
worth
of
him
until
he
died
ballade
of
a
ship
down
by
the
flash
of
the
restless
water
the
dim
white
ship
like
a
white
bird
lay
laughing
at
life
and
the
world
they
sought
her
and
out
she
swung
to
the
silvering
bay
then
off
they
flew
on
their
roystering
way
and
the
keen
moon
fired
the
light
foam
flying
up
from
the
flood
where
the
faint
stars
play
and
the
bones
of
the
brave
in
the
wave
are
lying
was
a
king
fair
son
with
a
king
fair
daughter
and
full
three
hundred
beside
they
say
revelling
on
for
the
lone
cold
slaughter
so
soon
to
seize
them
and
hide
them
for
aye
but
they
danced
and
they
drank
and
their
souls
grew
gay
nor
ever
they
knew
of
a
ghoul
eye
spying
their
splendor
a
flickering
phantom
to
stray
where
the
bones
of
the
brave
in
the
wave
are
lying
through
the
mist
of
a
drunken
dream
they
brought
her
this
wild
white
bird
for
the
prey
the
pitiless
reef
in
his
hard
clutch
caught
her
and
hurled
her
down
where
the
dead
men
stay
a
torturing
silence
of
wan
dismay
shrieks
and
curses
of
mad
souls
dying
then
down
they
sank
to
slumber
and
sway
where
the
bones
of
the
brave
in
the
wave
are
lying
envoy
prince
do
you
sleep
to
the
sound
alway
of
the
mournful
surge
and
the
crying
or
does
love
still
shudder
and
steel
still
slay
where
the
bones
of
the
brave
in
the
wave
are
lying
ballade
by
the
fire
slowly
i
smoke
and
hug
my
knee
the
while
a
witless
masquerade
of
things
that
only
children
see
floats
in
a
mist
of
light
and
shade
they
pass
a
flimsy
cavalcade
and
with
a
weak
remindful
glow
the
falling
embers
break
and
fade
as
one
by
one
the
phantoms
go
then
with
a
melancholy
glee
to
think
where
once
my
fancy
strayed
i
muse
on
what
the
years
may
be
whose
coming
tales
are
all
unsaid
till
tongs
and
shovel
snugly
laid
within
their
shadowed
niches
grow
by
grim
degrees
to
pick
and
spade
as
one
by
one
the
phantoms
go
but
then
what
though
the
mystic
three
around
me
ply
their
merry
trade
and
charon
soon
may
carry
me
across
the
gloomy
stygian
glade
be
up
my
soul
nor
be
afraid
of
what
some
unborn
year
may
show
but
mind
your
human
debts
are
paid
as
one
by
one
the
phantoms
go
envoy
life
is
the
game
that
must
be
played
this
truth
at
least
good
friend
we
know
so
live
and
laugh
nor
be
dismayed
as
one
by
one
the
phantoms
go
ballade
of
broken
flutes
to
t
schumann
in
dreams
i
crossed
a
barren
land
a
land
of
ruin
far
away
around
me
hung
on
every
hand
a
deathful
stillness
of
decay
and
silent
as
in
bleak
dismay
that
song
should
thus
forsaken
be
on
that
forgotten
ground
there
lay
the
broken
flutes
of
arcady
the
forest
that
was
all
so
grand
when
pipes
and
tabors
had
their
sway
stood
leafless
now
a
ghostly
band
of
skeletons
in
cold
array
a
lonely
surge
of
ancient
spray
told
of
an
unforgetful
sea
but
iron
blows
had
hushed
for
aye
the
broken
flutes
of
arcady
no
more
by
summer
breezes
fanned
the
place
was
desolate
and
gray
but
still
my
dream
was
to
command
new
life
into
that
shrunken
clay
i
tried
it
yes
you
scan
with
uncommiserating
glee
the
songs
of
one
who
strove
to
play
the
broken
flutes
of
arcady
envoy
so
rock
i
join
the
common
fray
to
fight
where
mammon
may
decree
and
leave
to
crumble
as
they
may
the
broken
flutes
of
arcady
ballade
of
dead
friends
as
we
the
withered
ferns
by
the
roadway
lying
time
the
jester
spurns
all
our
prayers
and
prying
all
our
tears
and
sighing
sorrow
change
and
woe
all
our
for
friends
that
come
and
go
life
awakes
and
burns
age
and
death
defying
till
at
last
it
learns
all
but
love
is
dying
love
the
trade
we
plying
god
has
willed
it
so
shrouds
are
what
we
buying
for
friends
that
come
and
go
man
forever
yearns
for
the
thing
that
flying
everywhere
he
turns
men
to
dust
are
drying
dust
that
wanders
eying
with
eyes
that
hardly
glow
new
faces
dimly
spying
for
friends
that
come
and
go
envoy
and
thus
we
all
are
nighing
the
truth
we
fear
to
know
death
will
end
our
crying
for
friends
that
come
and
go
her
eyes
up
from
the
street
and
the
crowds
that
went
morning
and
midnight
to
and
fro
still
was
the
room
where
his
days
he
spent
and
the
stars
were
bleak
and
the
nights
were
slow
year
after
year
with
his
dream
shut
fast
he
suffered
and
strove
till
his
eyes
were
dim
for
the
love
that
his
brushes
had
earned
at
last
and
the
whole
world
rang
with
the
praise
of
him
but
he
cloaked
his
triumph
and
searched
instead
till
his
cheeks
were
sere
and
his
hairs
were
gray
there
are
women
enough
god
knows
he
there
are
stars
enough
when
the
sun
away
then
he
went
back
to
the
same
still
room
that
had
held
his
dream
in
the
long
ago
when
he
buried
his
days
in
a
nameless
tomb
and
the
stars
were
bleak
and
the
nights
were
slow
and
a
passionate
humor
seized
him
there
seized
him
and
held
him
until
there
grew
like
life
on
his
canvas
glowing
and
fair
a
perilous
face
and
an
angel
too
angel
and
maiden
and
all
in
one
all
but
the
eyes
they
were
there
but
yet
they
seemed
somehow
like
a
soul
half
done
what
was
the
matter
did
god
forget
but
he
wrought
them
at
last
with
a
skill
so
sure
that
her
eyes
were
the
eyes
of
a
deathless
woman
with
a
gleam
of
heaven
to
make
them
pure
and
a
glimmer
of
hell
to
make
them
human
god
never
forgets
and
he
worships
her
there
in
that
same
still
room
of
his
for
his
wife
and
his
constant
arbiter
of
the
world
that
was
and
the
world
that
is
and
he
wonders
yet
what
her
love
could
be
to
punish
him
after
that
strife
so
grim
but
the
longer
he
lives
with
her
eyes
to
see
the
plainer
it
all
comes
back
to
him
two
men
there
be
two
men
of
all
mankind
that
i
should
like
to
know
about
but
search
and
question
where
i
will
i
can
not
ever
find
them
out
melchizedek

praised
the
lord
and
gave
some
wine
to

but
who
can
tell

else

more
learned
than

lost
his
house
when
agamemnon
came
to

but
who
can
tell
me
who
he
was
i
pray
the
gods
to
give
him
joy
there
be
two
men
of
all
mankind
that
i
forever
thinking
on
they
chase

the
yellow
years

gathered
fast
long
centuries
have
come
and
gone
and
yet
they
say
the
place
will
don
a
phantom
fury
of
the
past
since
persia
fell
at
marathon
and
as
of
old
when
helicon
trembled
and
swayed
with
rapture
vast
long
centuries
have
come
and
gone
this
ancient
plain
when
night
comes
on
shakes
to
a
ghostly
since
persia
fell
at
marathon
but
into
soundless
acheron
the
glory
of
greek
shame
was
cast
long
centuries
have
come

the
suns

twilight

the
dark
will

dark
if
anything

out
of

grave
i
come
to
tell
you
this
out
of
a
grave
i
come
to
quench
the
kiss
that
flames
upon
your
forehead
with
a
glow
that
blinds
you
to
the
way
that
you
must
go
yes
there
is
yet
one
way
to
where
she
is
bitter
but
one
that
faith
can
never
miss
out
of
a
grave
i
come
to
tell
you
this
to
tell
you
this
there
is
the
western
gate
luke
havergal
there
are
the
crimson
leaves
upon
the
wall
go
for
the
winds
are
tearing
them
away
nor
think
to
riddle
the
dead
words
they
say
nor
any
more
to
feel
them
as
they
fall
but
go
and
if
you
trust
her
she
will
call
there
is
the
western
gate
luke
havergal
luke
havergal
the
house
on
the
hill
they
are
all
gone
away
the
house
is
shut
and
still
there
is
nothing
more
to
say
through
broken
walls
and
gray
the
winds
blow
bleak
and
shrill
they
are
all
gone
away
nor
is
there
one
to
speak
them
good
or
ill
there
is
nothing
more
to
say
why
is
it
then
we
stray
around
that
sunken
sill
they
are
all
gone
away
and
our
poor
for
them
is
wasted
skill
there
is
nothing
more
to
say
there
is
ruin
and
decay
in
the
house
on
the
hill
they
are
all
gone
away
there
is
nothing
more
to
say
richard
cory
whenever
richard
cory
went
down
town
we
people
on
the
pavement
looked
at
him
he
was
a
gentleman
from
sole
to
crown
clean
favored
and
imperially
slim
and
he
was
always
quietly
arrayed
and
he
was
always
human
when
he
talked
but
still
he
fluttered
pulses
when
he
said
and
he
glittered
when
he
walked
and
he
was
rich
yes
richer
than
a
king
and
admirably
schooled
in
every
grace
in
fine
we
thought
that
he
was
everything
to
make
us
wish
that
we
were
in
his
place
so
on
we
worked
and
waited
for
the
light
and
went
without
the
meat
and
cursed
the
bread
and
richard
cory
one
calm
summer
night
went
home
and
put
a
bullet
through
his
head
two
octaves
i
not
by
the
grief
that
stuns
and
overwhelms
all
outward
recognition
of
revealed
and
righteous
omnipresence
are
the
days
of
most
of
us
affrighted
and
diseased
but
rather
by
the
common
snarls
of
life
that
come
to
test
us
and
to
strengthen
us
in
this
the
of
discontent
rebelliousness
and
shame
ii
when
through
hot
fog
the
fulgid
sun
looks
down
upon
a
stagnant
earth
where
listless
men
laboriously
dawdle
curse
and
sweat
disqualified
unsatisfied
inert
it
seems
to
me
somehow
that
god
himself
scans
with
a
close
reproach
what
i
have
done
counts
with
an
unphrased
patience
my
arrears
and
fathoms
my
unprofitable
thoughts
calvary
friendless
and
faint
with
martyred
steps
and
slow
faint
for
the
flesh
but
for
the
spirit
free
stung
by
the
mob
that
came
to
see
the
show
the
master
toiled
along
to
calvary
we
gibed
him
as
he
went
with
houndish
glee
till
his
dimmed
eyes
for
us
did
overflow
we
cursed
his
vengeless
hands
thrice
wretchedly
and
this
was
nineteen
hundred
years
ago
but
after
nineteen
hundred
years
the
shame
still
clings
and
we
have
not
made
good
the
loss
that
outraged
faith
has
entered
in
his
name
ah
when
shall
come
love
courage
to
be
strong
tell
me
o
lord
tell
me
o
lord
how
long
are
we
to
keep
christ
writhing
on
the
cross
dear
friends
dear
friends
reproach
me
not
for
what
i
do
nor
counsel
me
nor
pity
me
nor
say
that
i
am
wearing
half
my
life
away
for
that
only
fools
pursue
and
if
my
bubbles
be
too
small
for
you
blow
bigger
then
your
own
the
games
we
play
to
fill
the
frittered
minutes
of
a
day
good
glasses
are
to
read
the
spirit
through
and
whoso
reads
may
get
him
some
shrewd
skill
and
some
unprofitable
scorn
resign
to
praise
the
very
thing
that
he
deplores
so
friends
dear
friends
remember
if
you
will
the
shame
i
win
for
singing
is
all
mine
the
gold
i
miss
for
dreaming
is
all
yours
the
story
of
the
ashes
and
the
flame
no
matter
why
nor
whence
nor
when
she
came
there
was
her
place
no
matter
what
men
said
no
matter
what
she
was
living
or
dead
faithful
or
not
he
loved
her
all
the
same
the
story
was
as
old
as
human
shame
but
ever
since
that
lonely
night
she
fled
with
books
to
blind
him
he
had
only
read
the
story
of
the
ashes
and
the
flame
there
she
was
always
coming
pretty
soon
to
fool
him
back
with
penitent
scared
eyes
that
had
in
them
the
laughter
of
the
moon
for
baffled
lovers
and
to
make
him
think
before
she
gave
him
time
enough
to
wink
sin
kisses
were
the
keys
to
paradise
for
some
poems
by
matthew
arnold
sweeping
the
chords
of
hellas
with
firm
hand
he
wakes
lost
echoes
from
song
classic
shore
and
brings
their
crystal
cadence
back
once
more
to
touch
the
clouds
and
sorrows
of
a
land
where
god
truth
cramped
and
fettered
with
a
band
of
iron
creeds
he
cheers
with
golden
lore
of
heroes
and
the
men
that
long
before
wrought
the
romance
of
ages
yet
unscanned
still
does
a
cry
through
sad
valhalla
go
for
balder
pierced
with
lok
unhappy
spray
for
balder
all
but
spared
by
frea
charms
and
still
does
art
imperial
vista
show
on
the
hushed
sands
of
oxus
far
away
young
sohrab
dying
in
his
father
arms
amaryllis
once
when
i
wandered
in
the
woods
alone
an
old
man
tottered
up
to
me
and
said
come
friend
and
see
the
grave
that
i
have
made
for
amaryllis
there
was
in
the
tone
of
his
complaint
such
quaver
and
such
moan
that
i
took
pity
on
him
and
obeyed
and
long
stood
looking
where
his
hands
had
laid
an
ancient
woman
shrunk
to
skin
and
bone
far
out
beyond
the
forest
i
could
hear
the
calling
of
loud
progress
and
the
bold
incessant
scream
of
commerce
ringing
clear
but
though
the
trumpets
of
the
world
were
glad
it
made
me
lonely
and
it
made
me
sad
to
think
that
amaryllis
had
grown
old
kosmos
ah
shuddering
men
that
falter
and
shrink
so
to
look
on
death
what
were
the
days
we
live
where
life
is
half
a
struggle
to
forgive
but
for
the
love
that
finds
us
when
we
go
is
god
a
jester
does
he
laugh
and
throw
poor
branded
wretches
here
to
sweat
and
strive
for
some
vague
end
that
never
shall
arrive
and
is
he
not
yet
weary
of
the
show
think
of
it
all
ye
millions
that
have
planned
and
only
planned
the
largess
of
hard
youth
think
of
it
all
ye
builders
on
the
sand
whose
works
are
down
is
love
so
small
forsooth
be
brave
you
will
understand
the
doubt
the
pain
the
triumph
and
the
truth
zola
because
he
puts
the
compromising
chart
of
hell
before
your
eyes
you
are
afraid
because
he
counts
the
price
that
you
have
paid
for
innocence
and
counts
it
from
the
start
you
loathe
him
but
he
sees
the
human
heart
of
god
meanwhile
and
in
god
hand
has
weighed
your
squeamish
and
emasculate
crusade
against
the
grim
dominion
of
his
art
never
until
we
conquer
the
uncouth
connivings
of
our
shamed
indifference
we
call
it
christian
faith
are
we
to
scan
the
racked
and
shrieking
hideousness
of
truth
to
find
in
hate
polluted
throbbing
the
pulse
the
divine
heart
of
man
the
pity
of
the
leaves
vengeful
across
the
cold
november
moors
loud
with
ancestral
shame
there
came
the
bleak
sad
wind
that
shrieked
and
answered
with
a
shriek
reverberant
through
lonely
corridors
the
old
man
heard
it
and
he
heard
perforce
words
out
of
lips
that
were
no
more
to
speak
words
of
the
past
that
shook
the
old
man
cheek
like
dead
remembered
footsteps
on
old
floors
and
then
there
were
the
leaves
that
plagued
him
so
the
brown
thin
leaves
that
on
the
stones
outside
skipped
with
a
freezing
whisper
now
and
then
they
stopped
and
stayed
there
just
to
let
him
know
how
dead
they
were
but
if
the
old
man
cried
they
fluttered
off
like
withered
souls
of
men
aaron
stark
withal
a
meagre
man
was
aaron
stark
cursed
and
unkempt
shrewd
shrivelled
and
morose
a
miser
was
he
with
a
miser
nose
and
eyes
like
little
dollars
in
the
dark
his
thin
pinched
mouth
was
nothing
but
a
mark
and
when
he
spoke
there
came
like
sullen
blows
through
scattered
fangs
a
few
snarled
words
and
close
as
if
a
cur
were
chary
of
its
bark
glad
for
the
murmur
of
his
hard
renown
year
after
year
he
shambled
through
the
town
a
loveless
exile
moving
with
a
staff
and
oftentimes
there
crept
into
his
ears
a
sound
of
alien
pity
touched
with
tears
and
then
and
only
then
did
aaron
laugh
the
garden
there
is
a
fenceless
garden
overgrown
with
buds
and
blossoms
and
all
sorts
of
leaves
and
once
among
the
roses
and
the
sheaves
the
gardener
and
i
were
there
alone
he
led
me
to
the
plot
where
i
had
thrown
the
fennel
of
my
days
on
wasted
ground
and
in
that
riot
of
sad
weeds
i
found
the
fruitage
of
a
life
that
was
my
own
my
life
ah
yes
there
was
my
life
indeed
and
there
were
all
the
lives
of
humankind
and
they
were
like
a
book
that
i
could
read
whose
every
leaf
miraculously
signed
outrolled
itself
from
thought
eternal
seed
in
god
garden
of
the
mind
cliff
klingenhagen
cliff
klingenhagen
had
me
in
to
dine
with
him
one
day
and
after
soup
and
meat
and
all
the
other
things
there
were
to
eat
cliff
took
two
glasses
and
filled
one
with
wine
and
one
with
wormwood
then
without
a
sign
for
me
to
choose
at
all
he
took
the
draught
of
bitterness
himself
and
lightly
quaffed
it
off
and
said
the
other
one
was
mine
and
when
i
asked
him
what
the
deuce
he
meant
by
doing
that
he
only
looked
at
me
and
grinned
and
said
it
was
a
way
of
his
and
though
i
know
the
fellow
i
have
spent
long
time
when
i
shall
be
as
happy
as
cliff
klingenhagen
is
charles
carville
eyes
a
melancholy
face
charles
carville
had
but
not
so
melancholy
as
it
seemed
when
once
you
knew
him
for
his
mouth
redeemed
his
insufficient
eyes
forever
sad
in
them
there
was
no
good
or
bad
nor
joy
nor
passion
in
them
ever
gleamed
his
mouth
was
all
of
him
that
ever
beamed
his
eyes
were
sorry
but
his
mouth
was
glad
he
never
was
a
fellow
that
said
much
and
half
of
what
he
did
say
was
not
heard
by
many
of
us
we
were
out
of
touch
with
all
his
whims
and
all
his
theories
till
he
was
dead
so
those
blank
eyes
of
his
might
speak
them
then
we
heard
them
every
word
the
dead
village
here
there
is
death
but
even
here
they
say
here
where
the
dull
sun
shines
this
afternoon
as
desolate
as
ever
the
dead
moon
did
glimmer
on
dead
sardis
men
were
gay
and
there
were
little
children
here
to
play
with
small
soft
hands
that
once
did
keep
in
tune
the
strings
that
stretch
from
heaven
till
too
soon
the
change
came
and
the
music
passed
away
now
there
is
nothing
but
the
ghosts
of
things
no
life
no
love
no
children
and
no
men
and
over
the
forgotten
place
there
clings
the
strange
and
unrememberable
light
that
is
in
dreams
the
music
failed
and
then
god
frowned
and
shut
the
village
from
his
sight
boston
my
northern
pines
are
good
enough
for
me
but
there
a
town
my
memory
uprears
a
town
that
always
like
a
friend
appears
and
always
in
the
sunrise
by
the
sea
and
over
it
somehow
there
seems
to
be
a
downward
flash
of
something
new
and
fierce
that
ever
strives
to
clear
but
never
clears
the
dimness
of
a
charmed
antiquity
two
sonnets
i
just
as
i
wonder
at
the
twofold
screen
of
twisted
innocence
that
you
would
plait
for
eyes
that
uncourageously
await
the
coming
of
a
kingdom
that
has
been
so
do
i
wonder
what
god
love
can
mean
to
you
that
all
so
strangely
estimate
the
purpose
and
the
consequent
estate
of
one
short
shuddering
step
to
the
unseen
no
i
have
not
your
backward
faith
to
shrink
from
the
doorway
of
god
home
to
find
him
in
the
names
of
buried
men
nor
your
ingenious
recreance
to
think
we
cherish
in
the
life
that
is
to
come
the
scattered
features
of
dead
friends
again
ii
never
until
our
souls
are
strong
enough
to
plunge
into
the
crater
of
the
scheme
triumphant
in
the
flash
there
to
redeem
love
handsel
and
forevermore
to
slough
like
cerements
at
a
masque
the
rough
and
reptile
skins
of
us
whereon
we
set
the
stigma
of
scared
years
are
we
to
get
where
atoms
and
the
ages
are
one
stuff
nor
ever
shall
we
know
the
cursed
waste
of
life
in
the
beneficence
divine
of
starlight
and
of
sunlight
and
that
we
have
squandered
in
sin
frail
distress
till
we
have
drunk
and
trembled
at
the
taste
the
mead
of
thought
prophetic
endlessness
the
clerks
i
did
not
think
that
i
should
find
them
there
when
i
came
back
again
but
there
they
stood
as
in
the
days
they
dreamed
of
when
young
blood
was
in
their
cheeks
and
women
called
them
fair
be
sure
they
met
me
with
an
ancient
air
and
yes
there
was
a
brotherhood
about
them
but
the
men
were
just
as
good
and
just
as
human
as
they
ever
were
and
you
that
ache
so
much
to
be
sublime
and
you
that
feed
yourselves
with
your
descent
what
comes
of
all
your
visions
and
your
fears
poets
and
kings
are
but
the
clerks
of
time
tiering
the
same
dull
webs
of
discontent
clipping
the
same
sad
alnage
of
the
years
fleming
helphenstine
at
first
i
thought
there
was
a
superfine
persuasion
in
his
face
but
the
free
glow
that
filled
it
when
he
stopped
and
cried
hollo
shone
joyously
and
so
i
let
it
shine
he
said
his
name
was
fleming
helphenstine
but
be
that
as
it
may
i
only
know
he
talked
of
this
and
that
and
and
laughed
and
chaffed
like
any
friend
of
mine
but
soon
with
a
queer
quick
frown
he
looked
at
me
and
i
looked
hard
at
him
and
there
we
gazed
with
a
strained
shame
that
made
us
cringe
and
wince
then
with
a
wordless
clogged
apology
that
sounded
half
confused
and
half
amazed
he
dodged
and
i
have
never
seen
him
since
for
a
book
by
thomas
hardy
with
searching
feet
through
dark
circuitous
ways
i
plunged
and
stumbled
round
me
far
and
near
quaint
hordes
of
eyeless
phantoms
did
appear
twisting
and
turning
in
a
bootless
chase
when
like
an
exile
given
by
god
grace
to
feel
once
more
a
human
atmosphere
i
caught
the
world
first
murmur
large
and
clear
flung
from
a
singing
river
endless
race
then
through
a
magic
twilight
from
below
i
heard
its
grand
sad
song
as
in
a
dream
life
wild
infinity
of
mirth
and
woe
it
sang
me
and
with
many
a
changing
gleam
across
the
music
of
its
onward
flow
i
saw
the
cottage
lights
of
wessex
beam
thomas
hood
the
man
who
cloaked
his
bitterness
within
this
of
puns
and
pleasantries
god
never
gave
to
look
with
common
eyes
upon
a
world
of
anguish
and
of
sin
his
brother
was
the
branded
man
of
lynn
and
there
are
woven
with
his
jollities
the
nameless
and
eternal
tragedies
that
render
hope
and
hopelessness
akin
we
laugh
and
crown
him
but
anon
we
feel
a
still
chord
a
weird
unrest
and
thin
dim
shadows
home
to
midnight
steal
as
if
the
very
ghost
of
mirth
were
dead
as
if
the
joys
of
time
to
dreams
had
fled
or
sailed
away
with
ines
to
the
west
the
miracle
dear
brother
dearest
friend
when
i
am
dead
and
you
shall
see
no
more
this
face
of
mine
let
nothing
but
red
roses
be
the
sign
of
the
white
life
i
lost
for
him
she
said
no
do
not
curse
him
pity
him
instead
forgive
him
forgive
me
god
anodyne
for
human
hate
is
pity
and
the
wine
that
makes
men
wise
forgiveness
i
have
read
love
message
in
love
murder
and
i
die
and
so
they
laid
her
just
where
she
would
lie
under
red
roses
red
they
bloomed
and
fell
but
when
flushed
autumn
and
the
snows
went
by
and
spring
came
lo
from
every
bud
green
shell
burst
a
white
blossom
can
love
reason
why
horace
to
leuconoe
i
pray
you
not
leuconoe
to
pore
with
unpermitted
eyes
on
what
may
be
appointed
by
the
gods
for
you
and
me
nor
on
chaldean
figures
any
more
were
infinitely
better
to
implore
the
present
only
whether
jove
decree
more
winters
yet
to
come
or
whether
he
make
even
this
whose
hard
shore
shatters
the
tuscan
seas
the
last
be
wise
withal
and
rack
your
wine
nor
fill
your
bosom
with
large
hopes
for
while
i
sing
the
envious
close
of
time
is
narrowing
so
seize
the
day
or
ever
it
be
past
and
let
the
morrow
come
for
what
it
will
reuben
bright
because
he
was
a
butcher
and
thereby
did
earn
an
honest
living
and
did
right
i
would
not
have
you
think
that
reuben
bright
was
any
more
a
brute
than
you
or
i
for
when
they
told
him
that
his
wife
must
die
he
stared
at
them
and
shook
with
grief
and
fright
and
cried
like
a
great
baby
half
that
night
and
made
the
women
cry
to
see
him
cry
and
after
she
was
dead
and
he
had
paid
the
singers
and
the
sexton
and
the
rest
he
packed
a
lot
of
things
that
she
had
made
most
mournfully
away
in
an
old
chest
of
hers
and
put
some
cedar
boughs
in
with
them
and
tore
down
the
the
altar
alone
remote
nor
witting
where
i
went
i
found
an
altar
builded
in
a
dream
a
fiery
place
whereof
there
was
a
gleam
so
swift
so
searching
and
so
eloquent
of
upward
promise
that
love
murmur
blent
with
sorrow
warning
gave
but
a
supreme
unending
impulse
to
that
human
stream
whose
flood
was
all
for
the
flame
fury
bent
alas
i
said
the
world
is
in
the
wrong
but
the
same
quenchless
fever
of
unrest
that
thrilled
the
foremost
of
that
martyred
throng
thrilled
me
and
i
awoke
and
was
the
same
bewildered
insect
plunging
for
the
flame
that
burns
and
must
burn
somehow
for
the
best
the
tavern
whenever
i
go
by
there
nowadays
and
look
at
the
rank
weeds
and
the
strange
grass
the
torn
blue
curtains
and
the
broken
glass
i
seem
to
be
afraid
of
the
old
place
and
something
stiffens
up
and
down
my
face
for
all
the
world
as
if
i
saw
the
ghost
of
old
ham
amory
the
murdered
host
with
his
dead
eyes
turned
on
me
all
aglaze
the
tavern
has
a
story
but
no
man
can
tell
us
what
it
is
we
only
know
that
once
long
after
midnight
years
ago
a
stranger
galloped
up
from
tilbury
town
who
brushed
and
scared
and
all
but
overran
that
reprobate
john
evereldown
sonnet
oh
for
a
poet
for
a
beacon
bright
to
rift
this
changeless
glimmer
of
dead
gray
to
spirit
back
the
muses
long
astray
and
flush
parnassus
with
a
newer
light
to
put
these
little
to
flight
who
fashion
in
a
shrewd
mechanic
way
songs
without
souls
that
flicker
for
a
day
to
vanish
in
irrevocable
night
what
does
it
mean
this
barren
age
of
ours
here
are
the
men
the
women
and
the
flowers
the
seasons
and
the
sunset
as
before
what
does
it
mean
shall
not
one
bard
arise
to
wrench
one
banner
from
the
western
skies
and
mark
it
with
his
name
forevermore
george
crabbe
give
him
the
darkest
inch
your
shelf
allows
hide
him
in
lonely
garrets
if
you
will
but
his
hard
human
pulse
is
throbbing
still
with
the
sure
strength
that
fearless
truth
endows
in
spite
of
all
fine
science
disavows
of
his
plain
excellence
and
stubborn
skill
there
yet
remains
what
fashion
can
not
kill
though
years
have
thinned
the
laurel
from
his
brows
whether
or
not
we
read
him
we
can
feel
from
time
to
time
the
vigor
of
his
name
against
us
like
a
finger
for
the
shame
and
emptiness
of
what
our
souls
reveal
in
books
that
are
as
altars
where
we
kneel
to
consecrate
the
flicker
not
the
flame
credo
i
can
not
find
my
way
there
is
no
star
in
all
the
shrouded
heavens
anywhere
and
there
is
not
a
whisper
in
the
air
of
any
living
voice
but
one
so
far
that
i
can
hear
it
only
as
a
bar
of
lost
imperial
music
played
when
fair
and
angel
fingers
wove
and
unaware
dead
leaves
to
garlands
where
no
roses
are
no
there
is
not
a
glimmer
nor
a
call
for
one
that
welcomes
welcomes
when
he
fears
the
black
and
awful
chaos
of
the
night
for
through
it
all
above
beyond
it
all
i
know
the
message
of
the
years
i
feel
the
coming
glory
of
the
light
on
the
night
of
a
friend
wedding
if
ever
i
am
old
and
all
alone
i
shall
have
killed
one
grief
at
any
rate
for
then
thank
god
i
shall
not
have
to
wait
much
longer
for
the
sheaves
that
i
have
sown
the
devil
only
knows
what
i
have
done
but
here
i
am
and
here
are
six
or
eight
good
friends
who
most
ingenuously
prate
about
my
songs
to
such
and
such
a
one
but
everything
is
all
askew
as
if
the
time
were
come
or
almost
come
for
their
untenanted
mirage
of
me
to
lose
itself
and
crumble
out
of
sight
like
a
tall
ship
that
floats
above
the
foam
a
little
while
and
then
breaks
utterly

receive

end
this

for
the

live

we
do
so
frantically
strive

win
strange

we

a

ever
made

let
the

vision

you
can
read
as
on
belshazzar
wall
the
glory
of
eternal

supremacy
there
is
a
drear
and
lonely
tract
of
hell
from
all
the
common
gloom
removed
afar
a
flat
sad
land
it
is
where
shadows
are
whose
lorn
estate
my
verse
may
never
tell
i
walked
among
them
and
i
knew
them
well
men
i
had
slandered
on
life
little
star
for
churls
and
sluggards
and
i
knew
the
scar
upon
their
brows
of
woe
ineffable
but
as
i
went
majestic
on
my
way
into
the
dark
they
vanished
one
by
one
till
with
a
shaft
of
god
eternal
day
the
dream
of
all
my
glory
was
undone
and
with
a
fool
importunate
dismay
i
heard
the
dead
men
singing
in
the
sun
the
night
before
look
you
dominie
look
you
and
listen
look
in
my
face
first
search
every
line
there
mark
every
feature
chin
lip
and
forehead
look
in
my
eyes
and
tell
me
the
lesson
you
read
there
measure
my
nose
and
tell
me
where
i
am
wanting
a
man
nose
dominie
is
often
the
cast
of
his
inward
spirit
so
mark
mine
well
but
why
do
you
smile
so
pity
or
what
is
it
written
all
over
this
face
of
mine
with
a
brute
confession
nothing
but
sin
there
nothing
but
or
is
it
because
there
is
something
better
a
glimmer
of
good
maybe
or
a
shadow
of
something
that
followed
me
down
from
childhood
followed
me
all
these
years
and
kept
me
spite
of
my
slips
and
sins
and
follies
spite
of
my
last
red
sin
my
murder
just
out
of
hell
yes
something
of
that
kind
and
you
smile
for
that
you
a
good
man
dominie
the
one
good
man
in
the
world
who
knows
me
my
one
good
friend
in
a
world
that
mocks
me
here
in
this
hard
stone
cage
but
i
leave
it
my
god
am
i
crying
are
these
things
tears
tears
what
am
i
frightened
i
who
swore
i
should
go
to
the
scaffold
with
big
strong
steps
and
no
more
i
thank
you
but
no
i
am
all
right
now
no
listen
i
am
here
to
be
hanged
to
be
hanged
at
six
when
the
sun
is
rising
and
why
am
i
here
not
a
soul
can
tell
you
but
this
poor
shivering
thing
before
you
this
fluttering
wreck
of
the
man
god
made
him
for
god
knows
what
wild
reason
hear
me
and
learn
from
my
lips
the
truth
of
my
story
there
nothing
strange
in
what
i
shall
tell
you
nothing
mysterious
nothing
unearthly
but
damnably
human
and
you
shall
hear
it
not
one
of
those
little
black
lawyers
had
guessed
it
the
judge
with
his
big
bald
head
never
knew
it
and
the
jury
god
rest
their
poor
souls
never
dreamed
it
once
there
were
three
in
the
world
who
could
tell
it
now
there
are
two
there
be
two
you
my
friend
and
but
there
the
story
when
i
was
a
boy
the
world
was
heaven
i
never
knew
then
that
the
men
and
the
women
who
petted
and
called
me
a
brave
big
fellow
were
ever
less
happy
than
i
but
wisdom
which
comes
with
the
years
you
know
soon
showed
me
the
secret
of
all
my
glittering
childhood
the
broken
key
to
the
fairies
castle
that
held
my
life
in
the
fresh
glad
season
when
i
was
the
king
of
the
earth
then
slowly
and
yet
so
swiftly
there
came
the
knowledge
that
the
marvellous
life
i
had
lived
was
my
life
that
the
glorious
world
i
had
loved
was
my
world
and
that
every
man
and
every
woman
and
every
child
was
a
different
being
wrought
with
a
different
heat
and
fired
with
passions
born
of
a
single
spirit
that
the
pleasure
i
felt
was
not
their
pleasure
nor
my
sorrow
a
kind
of
nameless
pity
for
something
i
knew
not
what
their
sorrow
and
thus
was
i
taught
my
first
hard
lesson
the
lesson
we
suffer
the
most
in
learning
that
a
happy
man
is
a
man
forgetful
of
all
the
torturing
ills
around
him
when
or
where
i
first
met
the
woman
i
cherished
and
made
my
wife
no
matter
enough
to
say
that
i
found
her
and
kept
her
here
in
my
heart
with
as
pure
a
devotion
as
ever
christ
felt
for
his
brothers
forgive
me
for
naming
his
name
in
your
patient
presence
but
i
feel
my
words
and
the
truth
i
utter
is
god
own
truth
i
loved
that
woman
not
for
her
face
but
for
something
fairer
something
diviner
i
thought
than
beauty
i
loved
the
spirit
the
human
something
that
seemed
to
chime
with
my
own
condition
and
make
when
we
were
together
and
we
were
never
apart
from
the
moment
my
eyes
flashed
into
her
eyes
the
message
that
swept
itself
in
a
quivering
answer
back
through
my
strange
lost
being
my
pulses
leapt
with
an
aching
speed
and
the
measure
of
this
great
world
grew
small
and
smaller
till
it
seemed
the
sky
and
the
land
and
the
ocean
closed
at
last
in
a
mist
all
golden
around
us
two
and
we
stood
for
a
season
like
gods
outflung
from
chaos
dreaming
that
we
were
the
king
and
the
queen
of
the
fire
that
reddened
the
clouds
of
love
that
held
us
blind
to
the
new
world
soon
to
be
ours
ours
to
seize
and
sway
the
passion
of
that
great
love
was
a
nameless
passion
bright
as
the
blaze
of
the
sun
at
noonday
wild
as
the
flames
of
hell
but
mark
you
never
a
whit
less
pure
for
its
fervor
the
baseness
in
me
for
i
was
human
burned
like
a
worm
and
perished
and
nothing
was
left
me
then
but
a
soul
that
mingled
itself
with
hers
and
swayed
and
shuddered
in
fearful
triumph
when
i
consider
that
helpless
love
and
the
cursed
folly
that
wrecked
my
life
for
the
sake
of
a
woman
who
broke
with
a
laugh
the
chains
of
her
marriage
whatever
the
word
may
mean
i
wonder
if
all
the
woe
was
her
sin
or
whether
the
chains
themselves
were
enough
to
lead
her
in
love
despite
to
break
sinners
and
saints
i
say
are
rocked
in
the
cradle
but
never
are
known
till
the
will
within
them
speaks
in
its
own
good
time
so
i
foster
even
for
the
woman
who
wronged
me
nothing
of
hate
nor
of
love
but
a
feeling
of
still
regret
for
the
man
but
hear
me
and
judge
for
yourself
for
a
time
the
seasons
changed
and
passed
in
a
sweet
succession
that
seemed
to
me
like
an
endless
music
life
was
a
rolling
psalm
and
the
choirs
of
god
were
glad
for
our
love
i
fancied
all
this
and
more
than
i
dare
to
tell
you
yes
more
than
i
dare
to
remember
and
then
well
the
music
stopped
there
are
moments
in
all
men
lives
when
it
stops
i
fancy
or
seems
to
stop
till
it
comes
to
cheer
them
again
with
a
larger
sound
the
curtain
of
life
just
then
is
lifted
a
little
to
give
to
their
sight
new
joys
new
sorrows
or
nothing
at
all
sometimes
i
was
watching
the
slow
sweet
scenes
of
a
golden
picture
flushed
and
alive
with
a
long
delusion
that
made
the
murmur
of
home
when
i
shuddered
and
felt
like
a
knife
that
awful
silence
that
comes
when
the
music
goes
forever
the
truth
came
over
my
life
like
a
darkness
over
a
forest
where
one
man
wanders
worse
than
alone
for
a
time
i
staggered
and
stumbled
on
with
a
weak
persistence
after
the
phantom
of
hope
that
darted
and
dodged
like
a
frightened
thing
before
me
to
quit
me
at
last
and
vanish
nothing
was
left
me
then
but
the
curse
of
living
and
bearing
through
all
my
days
the
fever
and
thirst
of
a
poisoned
love
were
i
stronger
or
weaker
perhaps
my
scorn
had
saved
me
given
me
strength
to
crush
my
sorrow
with
hate
for
her
and
the
world
that
praised
her
to
have
left
her
then
and
there
to
have
conquered
that
old
false
life
with
a
new
and
a
wiser
such
things
are
easy
in
words
you
listen
and
frown
i
suppose
that
i
never
mention
that
beautiful
word
forgive
i
forgave
her
first
of
all
and
i
praised
kind
heaven
that
i
was
a
brave
clean
man
to
do
it
and
then
i
tried
to
forget
forgiveness
what
does
it
mean
when
the
one
forgiven
shivers
and
weeps
and
clings
and
kisses
the
credulous
fool
that
holds
her
and
tells
him
a
thousand
things
of
a
good
man
mercy
and
then
slips
off
with
a
laugh
and
plunges
back
to
the
sin
she
has
quit
for
a
season
to
tell
him
that
hell
and
the
world
are
better
for
her
than
a
prophet
heaven
believe
me
the
love
that
dies
ere
its
flames
are
wasted
in
search
of
an
alien
soul
is
better
better
by
far
than
the
lonely
passion
that
burns
back
into
the
heart
that
feeds
it
for
i
loved
her
still
and
the
more
she
mocked
me
fooled
with
her
endless
pleading
promise
of
future
faith
the
more
i
believed
her
the
penitent
thing
she
seemed
and
the
stronger
her
choking
arms
and
her
small
hot
kisses
bound
me
and
burned
my
brain
to
pity
the
more
she
grew
to
the
heavenly
creature
that
brightened
the
life
i
had
lost
forever
the
truth
was
gone
somehow
for
the
moment
the
curtain
fell
for
a
time
and
i
fancied
we
were
again
like
gods
together
loving
again
with
the
old
glad
rapture
but
scenes
like
these
too
often
repeated
failed
at
last
and
her
guile
was
wasted
i
made
an
end
of
her
shrewd
caresses
and
told
her
a
few
straight
words
she
took
them
full
at
their
worth
and
the
farce
was
at
first
my
dreams
of
the
past
upheld
me
but
they
were
a
short
support
the
present
pushed
them
away
and
i
fell
the
mission
of
life
whatever
it
was
was
blasted
my
game
was
lost
and
i
met
the
winner
of
that
foul
deal
as
a
sick
slave
gathers
his
painful
strength
at
the
sight
of
his
master
and
when
he
was
past
i
cursed
him
fearful
of
that
strange
chance
which
makes
us
mighty
or
mean
or
both
i
cursed
him
and
hated
the
stones
he
pressed
with
his
heel
i
followed
his
easy
march
with
a
backward
envy
and
cursed
myself
for
the
beast
within
me
but
pride
is
the
master
of
love
and
the
vision
of
those
old
days
grew
faint
and
fainter
the
counterfeit
wife
my
mercy
sheltered
was
nothing
now
but
a
woman
a
woman
out
of
my
way
and
out
of
my
nature
my
battle
with
blinded
love
was
over
my
battle
with
aching
pride
beginning
if
i
was
the
loser
at
first
i
wonder
if
i
am
the
winner
now
i
doubt
it
my
life
is
a
losing
game
and
christ
did
i
say
is
your
brandy
good
for
death
there
listen
when
love
goes
out
and
a
man
is
driven
to
shun
mankind
for
the
scars
that
make
him
a
joke
for
all
chattering
tongues
he
carries
a
double
burden
the
woes
i
suffered
after
that
hard
betrayal
made
me
pity
at
first
all
breathing
creatures
on
this
bewildered
earth
i
studied
their
faces
and
made
for
myself
the
story
of
all
their
scattered
lives
like
brothers
and
sisters
they
seemed
to
me
then
and
i
nourished
a
stranger
friendship
wrought
in
my
fancy
between
those
people
and
me
but
somehow
as
time
went
on
there
came
queer
glances
out
of
their
eyes
and
the
shame
that
stung
me
harassed
my
pride
with
a
crazed
impression
that
every
face
in
the
surging
city
was
turned
to
me
and
i
saw
sly
whispers
now
and
then
as
i
walked
and
wearied
my
wasted
life
twice
over
in
bearing
with
all
my
sorrow
the
sorrows
of
others
till
i
found
myself
their
fool
then
i
trembled
a
poor
scared
thing
and
their
prying
faces
told
me
the
ghastly
truth
they
were
laughing
at
me
and
my
fate
my
god
i
could
feel
it
that
laughter
and
then
the
children
caught
it
and
i
like
a
struck
dog
crept
and
listened
and
then
when
i
met
the
man
who
had
weakened
a
woman
love
to
his
own
desire
it
seemed
to
me
that
all
hell
were
laughing
in
fiendish
concert
i
was
their
victim
and
his
and
hate
and
there
was
the
struggle
as
long
as
the
earth
we
tread
holds
something
a
tortured
heart
can
love
the
meaning
of
life
is
not
wholly
blurred
but
after
the
last
loved
thing
in
the
world
has
left
us
we
know
the
triumph
of
hate
the
glory
of
good
goes
out
forever
the
beacon
of
sin
is
the
light
that
leads
us
downward
down
to
the
fiery
end
the
road
runs
right
through
hell
and
the
souls
that
follow
the
cursed
ways
where
its
windings
lead
them
suffer
enough
i
say
to
merit
all
grace
that
a
god
can
give
the
fashion
of
our
belief
is
to
lift
all
beings
born
for
a
life
that
knows
no
struggle
in
sin
tight
snares
to
eternal
glory
all
apart
from
the
branded
millions
who
carry
through
life
their
faces
graven
with
sure
brute
scars
that
tell
the
story
of
their
foul
fated
passions
science
has
yet
no
salve
to
smooth
or
soften
the
of
a
tyrant
visage
no
drug
to
purge
from
the
vital
essence
of
souls
the
sleeping
venom
virtue
may
flower
in
hell
when
its
roots
are
twisted
and
wound
with
the
roots
of
vice
but
the
stronger
never
is
known
till
there
comes
that
battle
with
sin
to
prove
the
victor
perilous
things
are
these
demons
we
call
our
passions
slaves
are
we
of
their
roving
fancies
fools
of
their
devilish
glee
you
think
me
i
know
in
this
maundering
way
designing
to
lighten
the
load
of
my
guilt
and
cast
it
half
on
the
shoulders
of
god
but
hear
me
i
partly
a
man
for
all
my
weakness
if
weakness
it
were
to
stand
and
murder
before
men
eyes
the
man
who
had
murdered
me
and
driven
my
burning
forehead
with
horns
for
the
world
to
laugh
at
trust
me
and
try
to
believe
my
words
but
a
portion
of
what
god
purpose
made
me
the
coward
within
me
cries
for
this
and
i
beg
you
now
as
i
come
to
the
end
to
remember
that
women
and
men
are
on
earth
to
travel
all
on
a
different
road
hereafter
the
roads
may
i
trust
in
something
i
know
not
well
this
was
the
way
of
it
stung
with
the
shame
and
the
secret
fury
that
comes
to
the
man
who
has
thrown
his
pittance
of
self
at
a
traitor
feet
i
wandered
weeks
and
weeks
in
a
baffled
frenzy
till
at
last
the
devil
spoke
i
heard
him
and
laughed
at
the
love
that
strove
to
touch
me
the
dead
lost
love
and
i
gripped
the
demon
close
to
my
breast
and
held
him
praising
the
fates
and
the
furies
that
gave
me
the
courage
to
follow
his
wild
command
forgetful
of
all
to
come
when
the
work
was
over
there
came
to
me
then
no
stony
vision
of
these
three
hundred
days
i
cherished
an
awful
joy
in
my
brain
i
pondered
and
weighed
the
thing
in
my
mind
and
gloried
in
life
to
think
that
i
was
to
conquer
death
at
his
own
dark
door
and
chuckled
to
think
of
it
done
so
cleanly
one
evening
i
knew
that
my
time
had
come
i
shuddered
a
little
but
rather
for
doubt
than
terror
and
followed
him
led
by
the
nameless
devil
i
worshipped
and
called
my
brother
the
city
shone
like
a
dream
that
night
the
windows
flashed
with
a
piercing
flame
and
the
pavements
pulsed
and
swayed
with
a
warmth
or
something
that
seemed
so
then
to
my
feet
and
thrilled
me
with
a
quick
dizzy
joy
and
the
women
and
men
like
marvellous
things
of
magic
floated
and
laughed
and
sang
by
my
shoulder
sent
with
a
wizard
motion
through
it
and
over
and
under
it
all
there
sounded
a
murmur
of
life
like
bees
and
i
listened
and
laughed
again
to
think
of
the
flower
that
grew
for
me
this
fellow
was
one
of
the
popular
sort
who
flourish
unruffled
where
gods
would
fall
for
a
conscience
he
carried
a
snug
deceit
that
made
him
the
man
of
the
time
and
the
place
whatever
the
time
or
the
place
might
be
were
he
sounding
with
a
genial
craft
that
cloaked
its
purpose
nigh
to
itself
the
depth
of
a
woman
fooled
with
his
brainless
art
or
sending
the
midnight
home
with
songs
and
bottles
the
cad
was
there
and
his
ease
forever
shone
with
the
smooth
and
slippery
polish
that
tells
the
snake
that
night
he
drifted
into
an
haunt
and
ordered
whatever
it
was
with
a
soft
assurance
that
made
me
mad
as
i
stood
behind
him
gripping
his
death
and
waited
coward
i
think
is
the
name
the
world
has
given
to
men
like
me
but
i
swear
i
never
thought
of
my
own
disgrace
when
i
shot
him
yes
in
the
back
i
know
it
i
know
it
now
but
what
if
i
do
as
i
watched
him
lying
there
dead
in
the
scattered
sawdust
wet
with
a
day
blown
froth
i
noted
that
things
were
still
that
the
walnut
tables
where
men
but
a
moment
before
were
sitting
were
gone
that
a
screen
of
something
around
me
shut
them
out
of
my
sight
but
the
gilded
signs
of
a
hundred
beers
and
whiskeys
flashed
from
the
walls
above
and
the
mirrors
and
glasses
behind
the
bar
were
lighted
in
some
strange
way
and
into
my
spirit
a
thousand
shafts
of
terrible
fire
burned
like
death
and
i
fell
the
story
of
what
came
then
you
know
but
tell
me
what
does
the
whole
thing
mean
what
are
we
slaves
of
an
awful
ignorance
puppets
pulled
by
a
fiend
or
gods
without
knowing
it
do
we
shut
from
ourselves
our
own
salvation
or
what
do
we
do
i
tell
you
dominie
there
are
times
in
the
lives
of
us
poor
devils
when
heaven
and
hell
get
mixed
though
conscience
may
come
like
a
whisper
of
christ
to
warn
us
away
from
our
sins
it
is
lost
or
laughed
at
and
then
we
fall
and
for
all
who
have
fallen
even
for
him
i
hold
no
malice
nor
much
compassion
a
mightier
mercy
than
mine
must
shrive
him
and
i
i
am
going
into
the
light
or
into
the
darkness
why
do
i
sit
through
these
sickening
hours
and
hope
good
god
are
they
hours
hours
yes
i
am
done
with
days
and
we
two
may
meet
walt
whitman
the
are
ended
and
the
man
that
sang
them
is
a
name
and
so
is
god
a
name
and
so
is
love
and
life
and
death
and
everything
but
we
who
are
too
blind
to
read
what
we
have
written
or
what
faith
has
written
for
us
do
not
understand
we
only
blink
and
wonder
last
night
it
was
the
song
that
was
the
man
but
now
it
is
the
man
that
is
the
song
we
do
not
hear
him
very
much
his
piercing
and
eternal
cadence
rings
too
pure
for
us
too
powerfully
pure
too
lovingly
triumphant
and
too
large
but
there
are
some
that
hear
him
and
they
know
that
he
shall
sing
for
all
men
and
that
all
time
shall
listen
the
are
ended
rather
say
no
songs
are
ended
that
are
ever
sung
and
that
no
names
are
dead
names
when
we
write
men
letters
on
proud
marble
or
on
sand
we
write
them
there
forever
the
chorus
of
old
men
in
aegeus
ye
gods
that
have
a
home
beyond
the
world
ye
that
have
eyes
for
all
man
agony
ye
that
have
seen
this
woe
that
we
have
seen
look
with
a
just
regard
and
with
an
even
grace
here
on
the
shattered
corpse
of
a
shattered
king
here
on
a
suffering
world
where
men
grow
old
and
wander
like
sad
shadows
till
at
last
out
of
the
flare
of
life
out
of
the
whirl
of
years
into
the
mist
they
go
into
the
mist
of
death
o
shades
of
you
that
loved
him
long
before
the
cruel
threads
of
that
black
sail
were
spun
may
loyal
arms
and
ancient
welcomings
receive
him
once
again
who
now
no
longer
moves
here
in
this
flickering
dance
of
changing
days
where
a
battle
is
lost
and
won
for
a
withered
wreath
and
the
black
master
death
is
over
all
to
chill
with
his
approach
to
level
with
his
touch
the
reigning
strength
of
youth
the
fluttered
heart
of
age
woe
for
the
fateful
day
when
delphi
word
was
lost
woe
for
the
loveless
prince
of
aethra
line
woe
for
a
father
tears
and
the
curse
of
a
king
release
woe
for
the
wings
of
pride
and
the
shafts
of
doom
and
thou
the
saddest
wind
that
ever
blew
from
crete
sing
the
fell
tidings
back
to
that
thrice
unhappy
ship
sing
to
the
western
flame
sing
to
the
dying
foam
a
dirge
for
the
sundered
years
and
a
dirge
for
the
years
to
be
better
his
end
had
been
as
the
end
of
a
cloudless
day
bright
by
the
word
of
zeus
with
a
golden
star
wrought
of
a
golden
fame
and
flung
to
the
central
sky
to
gleam
on
a
stormless
tomb
for
evermore
whether
or
not
there
fell
to
the
touch
of
an
alien
hand
the
sheen
of
his
purple
robe
and
the
shine
of
his
diadem
better
his
end
had
been
to
die
as
an
old
man
dies
but
the
fates
are
ever
the
fates
and
a
crown
is
ever
a
crown
the
wilderness
come
away
come
away
there
a
frost
along
the
marshes
and
a
frozen
wind
that
skims
the
shoal
where
it
shakes
the
dead
black
water
there
a
moan
across
the
lowland
and
a
wailing
through
the
woodland
of
a
dirge
that
sings
to
send
us
back
to
the
arms
of
those
that
love
us
there
is
nothing
left
but
ashes
now
where
the
crimson
chills
of
autumn
put
off
the
summer
languor
with
a
touch
that
made
us
glad
for
the
glory
that
is
gone
from
us
with
a
flight
we
can
not
follow
to
the
slopes
of
other
valleys
and
the
sounds
of
other
shores
away
come
away
you
can
hear
them
calling
calling
calling
us
to
come
to
them
and
roam
no
more
over
there
beyond
the
ridges
and
the
land
that
lies
between
us
there
an
old
song
calling
us
to
come
come
away
come
away
for
the
scenes
we
leave
behind
us
are
barren
for
the
lights
of
home
and
a
flame
that
young
forever
and
the
lonely
trees
around
us
creak
the
warning
of
the
that
love
and
all
the
dreams
of
love
are
away
beyond
the
mountains
the
songs
that
call
for
us
they
have
called
for
men
before
us
and
the
winds
that
blow
the
message
they
have
blown
ten
thousand
years
but
this
will
end
our
for
we
know
the
joy
that
waits
us
in
the
strangeness
of
and
a
faithful
woman
eyes
away
come
away
there
is
nothing
now
to
cheer
us
nothing
now
to
comfort
us
but
love
road
home
over
there
beyond
the
darkness
there
a
window
gleams
to
greet
us
and
a
warm
hearth
waits
for
us
come
away
come
away
or
the
will
hold
us
and
make
us
all
to
dwell
with
him
to
the
end
of
human
faring
there
are
no
men
yet
can
leave
him
when
his
hands
are
clutched
upon
them
there
are
none
will
own
his
enmity
there
are
none
will
call
him
brother
so
we
be
up
and
on
the
way
and
the
less
we
brag
the
better
for
the
freedom
that
god
gave
us
and
the
dread
we
do
not
know
the
frost
that
skips
the
will
again
be
back
to
blight
it
and
the
doom
we
can
not
fly
from
is
the
doom
we
do
not
see
away
come
away
there
are
dead
men
all
around
us
frozen
men
that
mock
us
with
a
wild
hard
laugh
that
shrieks
and
sinks
and
whimpers
in
the
shrill
november
rushes
and
the
long
fall
wind
on
the
octaves
i
to
get
at
the
eternal
strength
of
things
and
fearlessly
to
make
strong
songs
of
it
is
to
my
mind
the
mission
of
that
man
the
world
would
call
a
poet
he
may
sing
but
roughly
and
withal
ungraciously
but
if
he
touch
to
life
the
one
right
chord
wherein
god
music
slumbers
and
awake
to
truth
one
drowsed
ambition
he
sings
well
ii
we
thrill
too
strangely
at
the
master
touch
we
shrink
too
sadly
from
the
larger
self
which
for
its
own
completeness
agitates
and
undetermines
us
we
do
not
feel
we
dare
not
feel
it
yet
the
splendid
shame
of
uncreated
failure
we
forget
the
while
we
groan
that
god
accomplishment
is
always
and
unfailingly
at
hand
iii
to
mortal
ears
the
plainest
word
may
ring
fantastic
and
and
as
false
and
out
of
tune
as
ever
to
our
own
did
ring
the
prayers
of
maniacs
but
if
that
word
be
the
plain
word
of
truth
it
leaves
an
echo
that
begets
itself
persistent
in
itself
and
of
itself
regenerate
reiterate
replete
iv
tumultuously
void
of
a
clean
scheme
whereon
to
build
whereof
to
formulate
the
legion
life
that
riots
in
mankind
goes
ever
plunging
upward
up
and
down
most
like
some
crazy
regiment
at
arms
undisciplined
of
aught
but
ignorance
and
ever
led
resourcelessly
along
to
brainless
carnage
by
drunk
trumpeters
v
to
me
the
groaning
of
rings
like
a
lonely
music
played
in
hell
by
one
with
art
enough
to
cleave
the
walls
of
heaven
with
his
cadence
but
without
the
wisdom
or
the
will
to
comprehend
the
strangeness
of
his
own
perversity
and
all
without
the
courage
to
deny
the
profit
and
the
pride
of
his
defeat
vi
while
we
are
drilled
in
error
we
are
lost
alike
to
truth
and
usefulness
we
think
we
are
great
warriors
now
and
we
can
brag
like
titans
but
the
world
is
growing
young
and
we
the
fools
of
time
are
growing
with
it
we
do
not
fight
we
only
die
we
are
too
proud
of
death
and
too
ashamed
of
god
to
know
enough
to
be
alive
vii
there
is
one
whereon
we
fall
triumphant
and
unconquered
but
alas
we
are
too
fleshly
fearful
of
ourselves
to
fight
there
till
our
days
are
whirled
and
blurred
by
sorrow
and
the
ministering
wheels
of
anguish
take
us
eastward
where
the
clouds
of
human
gloom
are
lost
against
the
gleam
that
shines
on
thought
impenetrable
mail
viii
when
we
shall
hear
no
more
the
of
ages
when
the
timeless
hymns
of
love
defeat
them
and
outsound
them
we
shall
know
the
rapture
of
that
large
release
which
all
right
science
comprehends
and
we
shall
read
with
unoppressed
and
unoffended
eyes
that
record
of
whereon
god
writes
in
everlasting
runes
the
truth
of
him
ix
the
guerdon
of
new
childhood
is
repose
once
he
has
read
the
primer
of
right
thought
a
man
may
claim
between
two
smithy
strokes
beatitude
enough
to
realize
god
parallel
completeness
in
the
vague
and
incommensurable
excellence
that
equitably
uncreates
itself
and
makes
a
whirlwind
of
the
universe
x
there
is
no
loneliness
no
matter
where
we
go
nor
whence
we
come
nor
what
good
friends
forsake
us
in
the
seeming
we
are
all
at
one
with
a
complete
companionship
and
though
forlornly
joyless
be
the
ways
we
travel
the
compensate
of
wisdom
shaft
the
darkness
here
and
there
like
scattered
lamps
in
unfrequented
streets
xi
when
one
that
you
and
i
had
all
but
sworn
to
be
the
purest
thing
god
ever
made
bewilders
us
until
at
last
it
seems
an
angel
has
come
back
restigmatized
faith
wavers
and
we
wonder
what
there
is
on
earth
to
make
us
faithful
any
more
but
never
are
quite
wise
enough
to
know
the
wisdom
that
is
in
that
wonderment
xii
where
does
a
dead
man
go
the
dead
man
dies
but
the
free
life
that
would
no
longer
feed
on
fagots
of
outburned
and
shattered
flesh
wakes
to
a
thrilled
invisible
advance
unchained
or
fettered
else
of
memory
and
when
the
dead
man
goes
it
seems
to
me
were
better
for
us
all
to
do
away
with
weeping
and
be
glad
that
he
is
gone
xiii
still
through
the
dusk
of
dead
and
unremunerative
years
we
search
to
get
where
life
begins
and
still
we
groan
because
we
do
not
find
the
living
spark
where
no
spark
ever
was
and
thus
we
die
still
searching
like
poor
old
astronomers
who
totter
off
to
bed
and
go
to
sleep
to
dream
of
untriangulated
stars
xiv
with
conscious
eyes
not
yet
sincere
enough
to
pierce
the
glimmered
cloud
that
fluctuates
between
me
and
the
glorifying
light
that
screens
itself
with
knowledge
i
discern
the
searching
rays
of
wisdom
that
reach
through
the
mist
of
shame
infirm
credulity
and
infinitely
wonder
if
hard
words
like
mine
have
any
message
for
the
dead
xv
i
grant
you
friendship
is
a
royal
thing
but
none
shall
ever
know
that
royalty
for
what
it
is
till
he
has
realized
his
best
friend
in
himself
is
then
perforce
that
man
unfettered
faith
indemnifies
of
its
own
conscious
freedom
the
old
shame
and
love
revealed
infinitude
supplants
of
its
own
wealth
and
wisdom
the
old
scorn
xvi
though
the
sick
beast
infect
us
we
are
fraught
forever
with
indissoluble
truth
wherein
redress
reveals
itself
divine
transitional
transcendent
grief
and
loss
disease
and
desolation
are
the
dreams
of
wasted
excellence
and
every
dream
has
in
it
something
of
an
ageless
fact
that
flouts
deformity
and
laughs
at
years
xvii
we
lack
the
courage
to
be
where
we
are
we
love
too
much
to
travel
on
old
roads
to
triumph
on
old
fields
we
love
too
much
to
consecrate
the
magic
of
dead
things
and
yieldingly
to
linger
by
long
walls
of
ruin
where
the
ruinous
moonlight
that
sheds
a
lying
glory
on
old
stones
befriends
us
with
a
wizard
enmity
xviii
something
as
one
with
eyes
that
look
below
the
to
glimpse
the
foeman
charge
we
through
the
dust
of
downward
years
may
scan
the
onslaught
that
awaits
this
idiot
world
where
blood
pays
blood
for
nothing
and
where
life
pays
life
to
madness
till
at
last
the
ports
of
gilded
helplessness
be
battered
through
by
the
still
crash
of
salvatory
steel
xix
to
you
that
sit
with
sorrow
like
chained
slaves
and
wonder
if
the
night
will
ever
come
i
would
say
this
the
night
will
never
come
and
sorrow
is
not
always
but
my
words
are
not
enough
your
eyes
are
not
enough
the
soul
itself
must
insulate
the
real
or
ever
you
do
cherish
in
this
life
in
this
life
or
in
any
life
repose
xx
like
a
white
wall
whereon
forever
breaks
unsatisfied
the
tumult
of
green
seas
man
unconjectured
godliness
rebukes
with
its
imperial
silence
the
lost
waves
of
insufficient
grief
this
mortal
surge
that
beats
against
us
now
is
nothing
else
than
plangent
ignorance
truth
neither
shakes
nor
wavers
but
the
world
shakes
and
we
shriek
xxi
nor
jewelled
phrase
nor
mere
mellifluous
rhyme
reverberates
aright
or
ever
shall
one
cadence
of
that
infinite
which
is
itself
all
music
stronger
notes
than
any
that
have
ever
touched
the
world
must
ring
to
tell
it
ring
like
of
a
chime
primordial
on
anvils
in
the
gleaming
of

xxii
the
prophet
of
dead
words
defeats
himself
whoever
would
acknowledge
and
include
the
foregleam
and
the
glory
of
the
real
must
work
with
something
else
than
pen
and
ink
and
painful
preparation
he
must
work
with
unseen
implements
that
have
no
names
and
he
must
win
withal
to
do
that
work
good
fortitude
clean
wisdom
and
strong
skill
xxiii
to
curse
the
chilled
insistence
of
the
dawn
because
the
free
gleam
lingers
to
defraud
the
constant
opportunity
that
lives
unchallenged
in
all
sorrow
to
forget
for
this
large
prodigality
of
gold
that
larger
generosity
of
thought
these
are
the
fleshly
clogs
of
human
greed
the
fundamental
blunders
of
mankind
xxiv
forebodings
are
the
fiends
of
recreance
the
master
of
the
moment
the
clean
seer
of
ages
too
securely
scans
what
is
ever
to
be
appalled
at
what
is
not
he
sees
beyond
the
groaning
borough
lines
of
hell
god
highways
gleaming
and
he
knows
that
love
complete
communion
is
the
end
of
anguish
to
the
liberated
man
xxv
here
by
the
windy
docks
i
stand
alone
but
yet
companioned
there
the
vessel
goes
and
there
my
friend
goes
with
it
but
the
wake
that
melts
and
ebbs
between
that
friend
and
me
love
earnest
is
of
life
and
sailing
when
the
ships
of
wisdom
loose
their
fretful
chains
and
swing
forever
from
the
crumbled
wharves
of
time
two
quatrains
i
unity
as
eons
of
incalculable
strife
are
in
the
vision
of
one
moment
caught
so
are
the
common
concrete
things
of
life
divinely
shadowed
on
the
walls
of
thought
ii
paraphrase
we
shriek
to
live
but
no
man
ever
lives
till
he
has
rid
the
ghost
of
human
breath
we
dream
to
die
but
no
man
ever
dies
till
he
has
quit
the
road
that
runs
to
death
romance
i
boys
we
were
all
boys
and
three
of
us
were
friends
and
we
were
more
than
friends
it
seemed
to
me
yes
we
were
more
than
brothers
then
we
brothers
but
we
were
boys
and
there
it
ends
ii
james
wetherell
we
never
half
believed
the
stuff
they
told
about
james
wetherell
we
always
liked
him
well
enough
and
always
tried
to
use
him
well
but
now
some
things
have
come
to
light
and
james
has
vanished
from
our
view
there
is
very
much
to
write
there
is
very
much
to
do
the
torrent
i
found
a
torrent
falling
in
a
glen
where
the
sun
light
shone
silvered
and
the
boom
the
foam
and
the
mad
flash
of
it
all
made
a
magic
symphony
but
when
i
thought
upon
the
coming
of
hard
men
to
cut
those
patriarchal
trees
away
and
turn
to
gold
the
silver
of
that
spray
i
shuddered
yet
a
gladness
now
and
then
did
wake
me
to
myself
till
i
was
glad
in
earnest
and
was
welcoming
the
time
for
screaming
saws
to
sound
above
the
chime
of
idle
waters
and
for
me
to
know
the
jealous
visionings
that
i
had
had
were
steps
to
the
great
place
where
trees
and
torrents
go
now
in
a
thought
now
in
a
shadowed
word
now
in
a
voice
that
thrills
eternity
ever
there
comes
an
onward
phrase
to
me
of
some
transcendent
music
i
have
heard
no
piteous
thing
by
soft
hands
dulcimered
no
trumpet
crash
of
victory
but
a
glad
strain
of
some
still
symphony
that
no
proud
mortal
touch
has
ever
stirred
there
is
no
music
in
the
world
like
this
no
character
wherewith
to
set
it
down
no
kind
of
instrument
to
make
it
sing
no
kind
of
instrument
ah
yes
there
is
and
after
time
and
place
are
overthrown
god
touch
will
keep
its
one
chord
quivering
