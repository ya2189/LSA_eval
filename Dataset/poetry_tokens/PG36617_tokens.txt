goes
the
the
ballad
of
the
quest
some
day
i
said
before
life
is
over
i
will
shut
my
house
door
and
will
be
a
rover
under
the
sky
where
the
great
stars
roll
i
will
search
for
my
faith
and
search
for
my
soul
i
have
fared
without
them
this
many
a
day
through
the
of
the
world
the
truth
i
gave
in
exchange
for
a
lie
and
i
bartered
my
dreams
to
a
i
have
met
delilah
her
enchantments
i
know
as
the
man
of
strength
knew
them
ages
ago
fool
gold
and
fool
joy
have
been
my
reaping
and
my
heart
has
nothing
that
worth
the
keeping
but
the
world
is
wide
and
the
world
is
free
and
the
things
i
have
lost
may
come
back
to
me
i
will
follow
the
path
of
the
bird
that
flies
and
look
for
a
woman
with
honest
eyes
if
i
travel
hard
and
travel
alone
i
may
overtake
peace
and
make
it
my
own
only
the
sun
and
the
moon
sweet
light
shall
mark
my
day
or
measure
my
night
silks
and
satins
and
embroidered
things
i
exchange
for
blossoms
and
wings
and
under
a
i
will
dine
on
a
handful
of
berries
as
red
as
wine
or
i
earn
my
bread
on
the
ships
with
the
sun
in
my
eyes
and
salt
on
my
lips
and
for
the
softness
of
beds
and
pillows
i
take
a
hammock
that
swings
with
the
billows
it
may
be
the
trail
will
lead
me
afar
to
mountain
paths
where
the
wild
sheep
are
or
with
simple
people
and
free
from
guile
i
will
pitch
my
tent
and
will
rest
awhile
i
am
weary
of
softness
and
things
of
ease
and
weary
of
scribes
and
of
pharisees
on
a
morning
road
where
the
wind
is
strong
i
may
learn
again
to
whistle
a
song
down
forest
paths
or
the
ways
of
the
sea
my
soul
and
my
faith
may
come
back
to
me
and
always
and
ever
beneath
the
skies
i
will
look
for
a
woman
with
honest
eyes
i
will
follow
no
will
at
all
but
my
own
and
the
road
i
take
i
will
take
alone
some
day
i
said
before
life
is
over
i
will
shut
my
house
door
and
will
be
a
rover
ii
but
the
day
when
it
came
was
a
troubled
day
and
the
road
i
took
was
a
troubled
way
then
never
a
will
i
had
of
my
own
and
never
a
step
did
i
travel
alone
we
marched
by
day
and
we
marched
by
night
through
the
sun
hot
gold
or
the
moon
cool
light
we
marched
with
laughter
we
marched
with
song
or
in
dreadful
silence
we
marched
along
the
man
at
my
right
cursed
low
at
his
fate
the
man
at
my
left
smiled
early
and
late
and
the
faces
i
saw
at
the
edge
of
day
were
young
young
faces
turned
old
and
grey
the
field
where
poppies
flashed
red
in
the
wheat
was
a
hell
we
tramped
through
on
stumbling
feet
i
forgot
i
had
said
before
life
is
over
i
will
shut
my
house
door
and
will
be
a
rover
out
on
the
roads
where
the
guns
took
toll
i
gave
little
heed
to
my
faith
or
my
soul
in
the
trenches
where
only
the
dead
could
rest
life
was
a
death
was
a
jest
the
stars
swung
round
in
a
sky
and
the
earth
was
red
where
the
men
reeled
by
i
laughed
for
i
was
living
and
strong
and
i
tossed
them
the
line
of
a
battle
song
came
in
but
the
sweet
o
the
spring
who
should
know
there
was
any
such
thing
for
the
lovers
were
gone
who
used
to
know
the
english
lanes
where
the
hawthorns
blow
and
the
lovers
from
lands
far
over
the
sea
ah
the
watching
moon
only
knew
where
they
might
be
i
shook
my
impotent
hand
at
the
sky
and
travelled
on
with
a
battle
cry
iii
on
a
desperate
night
bitter
black
with
pain
my
soul
returned
to
haunt
me
again
we
two
kept
vigil
till
break
of
day
but
the
moon
bore
witness
i
did
not
pray
i
dreamt
i
drifted
with
a
name
on
my
lips
where
the
clouds
were
sea
waves
and
the
stars
little
ships
i
dreamt
and
lay
on
the
sod
like
a
thing
that
had
been
forgotten
of
god
i
saw
the
smoke
of
the
battle
roll
over
many
a
swift
departing
soul
but
when
the
dawn
was
a
violet
tide
a
shadow
came
and
knelt
at
my
side
no
not
a
shadow
or
mystery
but
a
rose
of
the
darkness
she
came
to
me
was
her
gown
and
about
her
head
was
a
shining
band
with
a
cross
of
red
her
eyes
were
closed
for
she
dared
not
see
what
the
guns
and
the
dark
had
made
of
me
so
i
caught
her
gown
in
fear
she
would
pass
like
a
lovely
shadow
across
the
grass
who
are
you
i
cried
who
have
found
me
here
where
i
have
lain
this
year
upon
year
no
no
but
one
night
beloved
she
said
while
i
searched
for
you
all
among
the
dead
but
you
were
so
strong
you
could
not
die
though
azrael
touched
you
as
he
passed
by
and
then
by
a
flame
that
lit
up
the
skies
i
looked
once
again
in
delilah
eyes
they
had
fear
and
were
sweet
and
deep
as
the
eyes
of
an
angel
who
bringeth
sleep
o
brave
one
she
said
you
soon
shall
see
from
your
thirst
and
your
pain
i
can
set
you
free
here
the
water
flask
i
will
lift
your
head
drink
if
you
will
and
spare
not
she
said
be
patient
and
wait
see
here
in
your
arm
the
poppies
of
god
shall
work
their
charm
so
she
spoke
while
her
voice
seemed
faint
and
far
as
though
it
drifted
down
from
a
star
i
have
come
she
faltered
belov√©d
at
last
even
so
i
said
from
the
past
i
would
know
i
cried
how
you
came
to
me
through
this
hell
where
no
woman
should
ever
be
i
heard
you
call
she
answered
and
then
i
followed
the
road
of
the
men
i
followed
the
bearers
for
far
and
far
they
travel
wherever
the
wounded
are
picket
and
sentry
and
the
men
who
fly
made
the
holy
sign
as
i
hurried
by
here
and
there
where
the
grass
was
red
i
stopped
for
a
moment
beside
the
dead
i
pressed
my
lips
to
their
tunic
hem
and
often
i
folded
the
hands
of
them
but
i
could
not
stay
and
when
dawn
was
near
you
called
again
and
i
found
you
here
o
sweet
no
more
i
said
tell
me
no
more
for
peace
has
come
in
through
the
morning
door
there
is
only
this
at
the
end
of
my
quest
only
you
and
love
and
a
spirit
at
rest
then
came
the
bearers
to
lift
me
away
but
beside
me
her
shadow
moved
tender
and
grey
a
song
of
poppies
i
love
red
poppies
imperial
red
poppies
are
they
gladly
as
trees
live
through
a
hundred
summers
they
live
one
little
day
i
love
red
poppies
impassioned
scarlet
poppies
even
their
strange
perfume
seems
like
an
essence
brewed
by
fairy
people
from
an
immortal
bloom
i
love
red
poppies
red
silken
swaying
poppies
deep
in
their
hearts
they
keep
a
magic
cure
for
woe
a
draught
of
lethe
a
of
sleep
i
love
red
poppies
soft
red
poppies
that
from
the
rain
and
sun
gather
a
balm
to
heal
some
sorrow
when
their
glad
day
is
done
the
shepherd
wind
when
hills
and
plains
are
powdered
white
and
bitter
cold
the
north
wind
blows
upon
my
window
in
the
night
a
grows
here
lilies
that
no
hand
hath
sown
bloom
white
as
foam
upon
the
sea
and
elfin
bells
to
earth
unknown
hold
melody
and
here
are
blossoms
like
to
stars
tangled
in
nets
of
silver
lace
my
very
breath
their
beauty
mars
or
stirs
them
from
their
place
perchance
the
echoes
of
old
songs
found
here
a
resting
place
at
last
with
drifting
perfume
that
belongs
to
roses
of
the
past
or
all
the
moonbeams
that
were
lost
on
summer
nights
the
world
forgets
may
here
be
prisoned
by
the
frost
with
souls
of
violets
the
wind
doth
shepherd
many
things
and
when
the
nights
are
long
and
cold
who
knows
how
strange
a
flock
he
brings
all
safely
to
the
fold
in
solitude
he
is
not
all
alone
whose
ship
is
sailing
over
the
mystery
of
an
unknown
sea
for
some
great
love
with
faithfulness
unfailing
will
light
the
stars
to
bear
him
company
out
in
the
silence
of
the
mountain
passes
the
heart
makes
peace
and
liberty
its
own
the
wind
that
blows
across
the
scented
grasses
bringing
the
balm
of
sleep
comes
not
alone
beneath
the
vast
illimitable
spaces
where
god
has
set
his
jewels
in
array
a
man
may
pitch
his
tent
in
desert
places
yet
know
that
heaven
is
not
so
far
away
but
in
the
city
in
the
lighted
city
where
gilded
spires
point
toward
the
sky
and
fluttering
rags
and
hunger
ask
for
pity
grey
loneliness
in
goes
by
the
slumber
angel
when
day
is
ended
and
grey
twilight
flies
on
silent
wings
across
the
tired
land
the
cometh
from
the
skies
the
of
the
peaceful
eyes
and
with
the
scarlet
poppies
in
his
hand
his
robes
are
dappled
like
the
moonlit
seas
his
hair
in
waves
of
silver
floats
afar
he
weareth
and
sweet
heartsease
with
tassels
of
the
rustling
green
fir
trees
as
down
the
dusk
he
steps
from
star
to
star
above
the
world
he
swings
his
curfew
bell
and
sleep
falls
soft
on
golden
heads
and
white
the
daisies
curl
their
leaves
beneath
his
spell
the
prisoner
who
wearies
in
his
cell
forgets
awhile
and
dreams
throughout
the
night
even
so
in
peace
comes
that
great
lord
of
rest
who
crowneth
men
with
amaranthine
flowers
who
telleth
them
the
truths
they
have
but
guessed
who
giveth
them
the
things
they
love
the
best
beyond
this
restless
rocking
world
of
ours
at
midnight
turn
thou
the
key
upon
our
thoughts
dear
lord
and
let
us
sleep
give
us
our
portion
of
forgetfulness
silent
and
deep
lay
thou
thy
quiet
hand
upon
our
eyes
to
close
their
sight
shut
out
the
shining
of
the
moon
and
stars
and
keep
back
the
phantoms
and
the
visions
sad
the
shades
of
grey
the
fancies
that
so
haunt
the
little
hours
before
the
day
quiet
the
questions
that
are
all
unanswered
yet
take
from
the
spent
and
troubled
souls
of
us
their
vain
regret
and
lead
us
far
into
thy
silent
land
that
we
may
go
like
children
out
across
the
field
o
dreams
where
poppies
blow
so
all
thy
saints
and
all
thy
sinners
too
wilt
thou
not
keep
since
not
alone
unto
thy
thou
givest
sleep
dreams
keep
thou
thy
dreams
though
joy
should
pass
thee
by
hold
to
the
rainbow
beauty
of
thy
thought
it
is
for
dreams
that
men
will
die
and
count
the
passing
pain
of
death
as
nought
keep
thou
thy
dreams
though
faith
should
faint
and
fail
and
time
should
loose
thy
fingers
from
the
creeds
the
vision
of
the
christ
will
still
avail
to
lead
thee
on
to
truth
and
tender
deeds
keep
thou
thy
dreams
through
all
the
winter
cold
when
weeds
are
withered
and
the
garden
grey
dream
thou
of
roses
with
their
hearts
of
gold
beckon
to
summers
that
are
on
their
way
keep
thou
thy
dreams
the
tissue
of
all
wings
is
woven
first
of
them
from
dreams
are
made
the
precious
and
imperishable
things
whose
loveliness
lives
on
and
does
not
fade

the
lines
in
brackets
are
supposed
to
be
sung
or
chanted
the
southern
mammy
seldom
sang
a
song
through
but
interlaced
it
with
when
jonquils
blow
when
jonquils
blow
i
think
of
one
who
sleeps
beneath
the
green
and
all
the
light
and
song
of
life
and
all
the
golden
sheen
turn
cold
and
still
before
my
eyes
while
boughs
of
may
seen
through
a
sudden
mist
of
tears
are
rimmed
with
lament
here
in
my
garden
where
the
tulips
grow
i
walk
alone
dim
are
my
eyes
with
tears
my
feet
are
slow
my
heart
is
stone
though
all
the
lovely
earth
again
for
me
new
sweetness
yields
it
matters
not
only
the
dead
i
see
on
battlefields
only
the
dead
i
see
and
strangely
bright
their
faces
shine
as
though
the
god
of
glory
in
the
night
had
made
them
fine
place
for
the
victors
stoop
my
soul
to
touch
their
tunics
hem
is
those
they
loved
who
need
tears
overmuch
o
weep
for
them
the
sea
the
sea
is
but
a
cradle
wide
and
deep
a
cradle
that
the
moon
rocks
to
and
fro
what
peace
they
find
who
there
fall
fast
asleep
what
lovely
dreams
is
not
for
us
to
know
but
god
hath
sent
the
angel
of
the
sea
to
sing
to
them
an
endless
lullaby
and
that
they
may
not
dread
night
mystery
he
lights
for
them
the
candles
of
the
sky
they
are
infolded
by
the
silken
waves
and
wrapped
in
shining
blue
and
emerald
green
they
drift
through
opalescent
ocean
caves
that
only
god
himself
hath
ever
seen
the
great
salt
wind
that
no
man
holds
in
thrall
touches
them
softly
as
it
passes
by
i
think
the
silver
sea
gulls
know
them
all
and
greet
them
with
their
lonely
tender
cry
for
but
a
little
little
round
of
years
the
sweet
foam
will
be
their
bed
and
they
will
slumber
hushed
from
any
fears
to
waken
when
the
sea
gives
up
her
dead
the
cry
they
have
laid
him
away
even
he
who
was
always
so
strong
and
gay
will
be
locked
in
the
earth
till
the
judgment
day
dust
unto
dust
i
have
heard
the
priest
say
he
will
never
return
though
i
weep
my
eyes
blind
though
i
pray
and
yearn
though
the
goes
out
and
the
great
suns
burn
into
whitest
ash
he
will
never
return
so
of
weeping
no
more
it
is
tears
fill
the
oceans
from
shore
to
shore
they
have
made
the
wind
salt
the
wind
at
my
door
they
harm
the
good
ground
so
of
weeping
no
more
not
again
not
again
do
you
hear
the
sea
singing
that
one
refrain
the
pine
trees
the
wind
and
the
wearysome
rain
all
whisper
it
never
again
not
again
who
can
tell
me
who
knows
where
his
lonely
soul
travels
whither
it
goes
has
he
gone
like
the
leaves
like
yesterday
snows
speak
dear
lord
of
death
you
who
died
and
arose
the
bridge
of
dreams
the
thought
of
thee
is
like
a
swinging
tune
a
little
swinging
tune
i
seem
to
hear
the
thought
of
thee
is
like
the
breeze
of
june
blowing
across
the
winter
of
the
year
the
thought
of
thee
is
like
a
golden
star
set
all
alone
within
the
midnight
blue
a
candle
shining
from
afar
upon
the
road
that
we
are
passing
through
the
thought
of
thee
is
like
the
woods
in
spring
with
and
the
thought
of
thee
is
what
the
four
winds
bring
over
the
banks
of
mignonette
and
all
the
music
of
the
twilight
sea
echoes
thy
voice
in
tender
undertone
the
seem
but
thoughts
of
thee
caught
on
the
salted
wing
and
homeward
blown
god
keeps
the
secret
of
his
heaven
well
but
azrael
finds
its
gates
they
be
and
from
the
earth
to
fields
of
asphodel
i
build
a
bridge
of
dreams
and
cross
to
thee
the
shells
o
my
brave
heart
o
my
strong
heart
my
sweet
heart
and
gay
the
soul
of
me
went
with
you
the
hour
you
marched
away
for
surely
she
is
soulless
this
woman
white
and
still
who
works
with
shining
metal
to
make
the
things
that
kill
i
tremble
as
i
touch
them
so
strange
they
are
and
bright
each
one
will
be
a
comet
to
break
the
purple
night
grey
fear
will
ride
before
it
and
death
will
ride
behind
the
sound
of
it
will
deafen
the
light
of
it
will
blind
and
whom
it
meets
in
passing
but
god
alone
will
know
each
one
will
blaze
a
trail
in
blood
will
hew
a
road
of
woe
o
when
the
fear
is
on
me
my
heart
grows
faint
and
cold
i
dare
not
think
of
what
i
do
of
what
my
fingers
hold
then
sounds
a
voice
arise
and
make
the
weapons
of
the
lord
he
rides
upon
the
whirlwind
he
hath
need
of
shell
and
sword
his
army
is
a
mighty
host
the
lovely
and
the
strong
they
follow
him
to
battle
with
trumpet
and
with
song
o
my
brave
heart
my
strong
heart
my
sweet
heart
and
dear
is
not
for
me
to
falter
is
not
for
me
to
fear
across
the
utmost
barrier
wherever
you
may
be
with
joy
unspent
and
deathless
my
soul
will
follow
thee
requiem
weep
for
the
dead
weep
for
the
swift
slain
dead
november
skies
too
few
the
tears
that
day
and
night
are
shed
from
women
eyes
blow
them
lightly
with
a
soft
caress
wind
of
the
sea
if
you
are
tender
they
may
miss
love
less
they
be
come
gentle
moon
swing
low
your
lantern
light
on
reddened
fields
and
find
the
lonely
harvest
of
the
night
that
battle
yields
banish
the
darkness
filled
with
quivering
dread
lest
they
should
know
some
last
strange
horror
even
they
the
dead
sweet
moon
swing
low
fold
them
at
dawn
dear
earth
within
your
arms
so
safe
and
strong
hold
them
asleep
till
they
forget
alarms
and
woe
and
wrong
master
of
kings
if
peace
be
bought
with
pain
these
paid
the
price
o
show
thy
tortured
world
that
not
in
vain
is
sacrifice
the
crosses
the
little
lonely
crosses
the
crosses
low
and
white
they
haunt
me
most
in
the
silver
hour
that
lies
against
the
night
or
when
the
dawn
comes
in
with
a
star
for
candlelight
the
little
lonely
crosses
in
fields
so
far
away
they
cast
a
shadow
on
my
path
and
take
which
road
i
may
it
follows
follows
follows
throughout
the
livelong
day
o
little
lonely
crosses
that
gentle
hands
have
made
you
mean
to
us
forevermore
the
price
that
has
been
paid
for
a
heritage
of
freedom
and
a
people
unafraid
so
as
a
pilgrim
to
his
shrine
in
dreams
i
rise
and
go
to
find
the
poppied
place
of
sleep
and
the
crosses
row
on
row
the
crosses
carved
with
names
beloved
the
crosses
white
and
low
the
lonely
road
we
used
to
fear
the
lonely
road
that
twisted
round
the
hill
it
dipped
down
to
the
and
passed
the
haunted
mill
and
then
crept
on
until
it
reached
the
churchyard
green
and
still
no
pipers
ever
took
that
road
no
gipsies
brown
and
gay
no
shepherds
with
their
gentle
flocks
no
loads
of
scented
hay
no
jingled
by
on
any
saturday
the
there
flung
wide
its
stars
in
april
silvery
sweet
the
squirrels
crossed
that
path
all
day
on
tiny
flying
feet
the
wild
brown
rabbits
knew
each
turn
each
shadowy
safe
retreat
and
there
the
bee
sang
his
sweet
summer
song
the
crickets
chirped
there
to
the
moon
with
steady
note
and
strong
till
cold
and
silence
wrapped
them
round
when
autumn
nights
grew
long
but
oh
they
brought
the
lonely
dead
along
that
quiet
way
with
strange
procession
dark
and
slow
on
sunny
days
and
grey
we
used
to
watch
them
nor
care
again
to
play
and
we
forgot
each
merry
jest
the
birds
on
bush
and
tree
silenced
the
song
within
their
throats
and
with
us
watched
to
see
the
soft
slow
passing
out
of
sight
of
that
dark
mystery
we
fear
no
more
the
lonely
road
that
winds
around
the
hill
far
from
the
busy
world
highway
and
the
gods
mill
it
only
seems
a
peaceful
path
pleasant
and
green
and
still
to
one
who
sleeps
fare
not
too
far
my
own
down
ways
all
strange
and
new
for
i
must
find
alone
the
road
that
leads
to
you
enchantments
may
arise
to
lure
thy
little
feet
and
charm
thy
wondering
eyes
yet
wait
for
me
my
sweet
already
earth
doth
seem
a
phantom
place
to
me
and
thy
far
home
of
dream
is
my
reality
so
this
is
just
some
stars
will
rise
and
wane
but
sure
as
comes
the
light
i
be
with
thee
again
april
again
april
again
the
willow
wands
are
yellow
the
brambles
that
the
passing
wind
knows
comes
a
robin
note
like
the
note
of
a
and
across
the
valley
the
calling
of
the
crows
april
again
april
again
and
the
marsh
birds
swinging
over
the
rushes
that
belong
to
silver
shines
the
river
and
young
lips
are
singing
songs
as
old
as
eden
as
old
and
as
dear
april
again
april
again
with
a
wet
wind
blowing
and
along
the
western
sky
a
pathway
of
gold
sounds
a
call
to
follow
the
road
we
not
knowing
a
new
road
a
wild
road
fairy
lands
unrolled
april
again
april
again
with
its
wonder
of
gladness
april
with
its
haunting
joy
and
tears
month
of
mist
and
music
and
the
old
month
of
magic
fluting
the
spirit
only
hears
april
again
histories
i
weary
of
the
histories
of
men
the
garnered
store
of
books
in
grim
array
life
bitter
salvage
and
then
left
to
the
silence
and
a
bloom
of
gray
i
weary
of
the
stories
that
they
hold
the
clash
of
arms
sounds
through
them
like
a
knell
i
weary
of
the
kings
in
crowns
of
gold
the
kings
victorious
and
the
kings
who
fell
there
are
too
many
tears
on
every
page
too
red
a
tide
sweeps
every
chapter
in
there
is
no
word
of
peace
in
any
age
except
the
peace
that
death
rode
forth
to
win
and
old
unhappiness
long
wrapped
in
sleep
and
feud
that
passed
in
wrath
and
woe
and
white
despair
from
many
a
dungeon
keep
arise
to
haunt
us
still
we
go
yet
through
the
years
the
sun
was
warm
and
sweet
and
pipers
piped
at
morn
and
night
and
noon
and
there
was
carnival
with
dancing
feet
and
love
and
joyance
always
came
in
june
o
to
remember
when
the
pages
close
linked
with
the
vision
of
the
deathless
brave
the
nightingale
the
moonlight
and
the
rose
and
all
the
beauty
that
the
lost
years
gave
fireflies
from
an
old
italian
legend
true
lovers
words
are
deathless
things
eros
the
little
god
and
wise
catches
them
all
gives
to
them
wings
and
turns
them
into
fireflies
words
that
are
sweet
as
a
caress
and
wild
bright
words
no
will
can
tame
soft
words
of
haunting
tenderness
words
that
are
like
a
flame
the
magic
word
the
jewelled
word
the
word
that
hides
a
thousand
fears
these
all
the
perfumed
winds
have
heard
through
all
the
immemorial
years
not
one
is
lost
by
old
sea
walls
and
over
beds
of
mignonette
and
through
lost
lanes
when
darkness
falls
in
loveliness
they
sparkle
yet
then
down
the
velvet
sea
of
night
like
little
lighted
ships
asail
they
pass
away
and
out
of
sight
companioned
by
the
nightingale
the
vanished
i
grieve
to
think
the
little
gods
have
vanished
the
with
the
in
their
hair
i
sorrow
much
the
pan
is
banished
and
that
the
dryads
are
not
anywhere
the
shrine
of
flora
has
no
need
of
flowers
diana
seeks
her
arrows
in
the
sky
apollo
beauty
was
a
thing
of
hours
and
artemis
herself
learned
how
to
die
i
think
endymion
released
from
sleeping
walks
through
the
at
the
heaven
rim
for
he
is
gone
though
still
the
moon
is
keeping
her
tireless
and
beloved
watch
for
him
on
river
banks
the
purple
grapes
are
growing
but
bacchus
and
his
merry
train
have
passed
where
are
the
little
fauns
i
would
be
knowing
in
all
the
world
who
heard
and
saw
them
last
if
but
the
small
grey
elfs
were
still
astraying
where
shadows
lace
the
golden
forest
ways
what
joy
to
meet
them
and
be
long
delaying
the
sombre
tasks
that
fill
the
working
days
i
grieve
to
think
the
little
gods
have
vanished
the
with
the
in
their
hair
i
sorrow
much
the
pan
is
banished
and
that
the
dryads
are
not
anywhere
pathfinders
these
were
the
men
of
the
restless
heart
the
brothers
to
wind
and
tide
they
followed
the
lure
of
the
far
away
and
they
saw
a
vision
by
night
and
day
of
lands
that
were
free
and
wide
they
blazed
the
long
and
desolate
trail
and
set
their
mark
on
the
trees
and
sometimes
only
the
star
of
the
north
guided
their
little
lone
ships
that
set
forth
upon
the
uncharted
seas
they
marked
a
road
through
the
shifting
sand
where
never
a
road
had
led
and
beneath
the
pavilions
of
the
sky
in
a
deep
and
abiding
peace
they
lie
with
the
world
forgotten
dead
the
ice
of
the
arctic
shut
them
in
and
locked
its
crystalline
doors
or
it
may
be
a
tide
that
was
hot
and
slow
drifted
them
in
where
grow
on
tropical
shores
they
journeyed
beyond
the
shadow
of
fear
and
past
the
ghost
of
despair
on
the
coasts
of
coral
they
made
their
bed
or
they
fell
asleep
where
the
ground
was
red
and
grey
wings
shadowed
the
air
high
adventurers
gentlemen
all
knights
of
the
golden
code
that
we
might
ride
softly
you
rode
hard
that
we
might
go
safely
you
without
guard
followed
the
perilous
road
the
call
come
to
me
out
of
the
night
in
any
way
that
you
will
as
a
radiance
unspeakably
bright
or
a
shadow
and
still
nothing
will
touch
me
of
fear
harken
i
make
thee
my
vow
out
of
the
darkness
my
dear
come
to
me
now
this
is
the
old
haunted
place
haunted
by
ghosts
of
spent
hours
decked
by
the
ivy
green
lace
sweet
with
the
flowers
this
is
the
garden
you
know
and
tranquil
and
dear
i
alone
walk
to
and
fro
come
to
me
here
before
the
dawn
in
that
one
darkest
hour
before
the
dawn
is
here
each
soul
of
us
goes
sailing
close
to
the
coast
of
fear
there
in
the
windless
quiet
from
out
the
folded
black
the
things
we
have
forgotten
or
would
forget
come
back
old
sorrows
long
abandoned
or
kept
with
lock
and
key
steal
from
their
prison
places
to
bear
us
company
all
softly
come
our
little
sins
our
scarlet
sins
and
gray
to
keep
with
us
a
vigil
till
breaking
of
the
day
and
there
are
velvet
footsteps
or
oft
we
seem
to
hear
light
garments
brush
against
the
dark
so
near
so
very
near
from
out
the
red
confusion
where
men
long
watches
keep
new
shadows
come
we
know
they
come
and
in
the
dark
we
weep
then
heavily
as
weighed
by
tears
each
haunted
moment
goes
for
dawn
steps
down
the
morning
sky
in
robes
of
gray
and
rose
o
fairies
of
the
and
little
men
in
green
and
pixies
of
the
moonlight
and
elves
no
eye
hath
seen
brew
us
a
magic
potion
of
deep
and
fairy
power
a
draught
of
lethe
for
one
night
to
tide
us
past
that
hour
the
fairy
clock
silver
clock
o
silver
clock
tell
to
me
the
time
o
day
is
there
yet
a
little
hour
left
for
us
to
work
and
play
tell
me
when
the
sun
will
set
tiny
globe
of
it
has
been
so
glad
a
world
since
the
coming
of
the
morn
oft
i
wondered
when
i
met
any
souls
who
seemed
forlorn
and
i
scarce
gave
heed
to
those
who
were
old
or
travel
worn
mayhap
i
have
loved
too
well
all
the
merry
fleeting
things
run
too
lightly
with
the
wind
chased
too
many
shining
wings
thought
too
seldom
of
the
night
and
the
silence
that
it
brings
well
i
fear
me
i
have
been
but
an
idler
in
the
sun
all
unfinished
are
the
tasks
long
and
long
ago
begun
in
the
dark
perchance
they
weep
who
have
left
their
work
undone
and
i
know
each
friar
preacheth
sermons
that
alas
fain
would
halt
the
dancing
feet
of
those
careless
ones
who
pass
down
a
sweet
and
primrose
path
through
the
ribbons
of
the
grass
o
it
was
only
yesterday
dandelions
flecked
the
field
and
gold
and
gay
you
are
but
the
ghost
of
one
little
globe
of
tell
me
tell
me
of
the
hour
for
there
is
so
much
to
do
is
it
early
is
it
late
o
tell
me
true
as
i
blow
you
down
the
wind
out
upon
a
road
of
blue
the
temple
enter
the
temple
beautiful
the
house
not
made
with
hands
and
green
and
clean
beneath
the
blue
it
stands
and
no
cathedral
anywhere
seemeth
so
holy
or
so
fair
it
hath
no
heavy
gabled
roof
no
door
with
lock
and
key
no
shut
out
the
stars
the
aisles
are
wide
and
free
here
through
the
night
each
is
but
a
silently
as
the
temple
grew
at
solomon
command
still
as
things
seem
within
a
dream
this
rose
from
out
the
land
and
all
the
pillars
grey
and
high
lifted
their
arches
to
the
sky
here
is
the
perfume
of
the
leaves
the
incense
of
the
pines
the
magic
scent
that
hath
been
pent
within
the
tangled
vines
no
censor
filled
with
spices
rare
swung
such
sweetness
on
the
air
and
all
the
golden
gloom
of
it
holdeth
no
haunting
fear
for
it
is
blessed
and
giveth
rest
to
those
who
enter
here
here
in
the
evening
who
can
know
but
god
himself
walks
to
and
fro
and
music
past
all
mastering
within
the
chancel
rings
none
could
desire
a
sweeter
choir
than
this
that
soars
and
sings
till
far
the
scented
shadows
creep
and
quiet
darkness
bringeth
sleep
the
whistler
throughout
the
sunny
day
he
whistled
on
his
way
oh
high
and
low
and
gay
and
sweet
the
melody
rang
down
the
street
till
all
the
weary
old
and
grey
smiled
at
their
work
or
stopped
to
say
now
god
be
thanked
that
youth
is
fair
and
light
of
heart
and
free
from
care
what
time
the
wind
blew
high
he
whistled
and
went
by
then
clarion
clear
on
every
side
the
song
was
scattered
far
and
wide
like
birds
above
a
storm
that
fly
the
silver
notes
soared
to
the
sky
o
soul
whose
courage
does
not
fail
but
with
a
song
can
meet
the
gale
and
when
the
rain
fell
fast
he
whistled
as
he
passed
a
little
tune
the
whole
world
knew
a
song
of
love
of
love
most
true
on
through
the
mist
it
came
at
last
to
one
by
sorrow
overcast
dear
christ
she
said
by
night
and
day
they
serve
who
praise
as
well
as
pray
though
the
great
world
was
white
he
whistled
in
the
night
the
sky
was
spangled
all
with
gold
the
bitter
wind
was
keen
and
cold
yet
dear
musician
out
of
sight
you
still
put
wintry
thoughts
to
flight
for
summer
follows
where
you
fare
o
whistler
so
debonair
and
when
the
fog
hung
grey
he
whistled
on
his
way
the
little
children
in
his
train
with
rosy
lips
caught
up
the
strain
then
i
to
hear
what
he
might
say
followed
with
them
that
sombre
day
is
it
for
joy
of
life
quoth
i
good
sir
you
go
awhistling
by
he
smiled
and
sighed
and
shook
his
head
i
cheer
my
own
sad
heart
he
said
march
windy
march
weather
with
a
lone
crow
flying
a
little
ebony
airship
careening
down
the
blue
and
high
high
above
him
a
wild
goose
crying
the
leading
cry
the
clarion
cry
that
guides
his
grey
lines
through
windy
march
weather
with
the
pine
trees
singing
the
brambles
show
and
the
birch
and
a
squirrel
on
a
top
branch
swinging
a
friendly
elf
who
nods
to
me
from
his
far
perilous
perch
windy
march
weather
with
the
tawny
brook
that
hurries
eager
for
the
outward
rush
of
rivers
to
the
sea
a
tiny
brook
that
frets
and
sings
and
worries
a
rough
adventurous
little
brook
that
calls
and
calls
to
me
windy
march
weather
and
the
old
spring
madness
tempting
us
to
take
the
trail
that
wanders
free
and
far
whispering
of
magic
roads
that
wind
to
lands
of
gladness
where
vanished
joys
and
lost
delights
and
garnered
treasures
are
on
silver
nights
on
silver
nights
i
can
not
sleep
the
ancient
moon
from
far
above
bids
me
arise
and
run
and
keep
a
rendezvous
with
one
i
love
and
in
my
heart
a
little
song
swings
to
and
fro
its
clear
refrain
while
down
the
stairs
i
haste
along
as
though
the
past
were
mine
again
then
is
my
spirit
so
beguiled
by
all
the
night
white
witchery
that
i
am
kin
to
all
things
wild
and
part
of
all
things
that
are
free
then
he
comes
back
who
long
ago
left
these
green
paths
his
steps
had
trod
yes
he
comes
back
i
know
i
know
from
the
fields
of
god
so
through
the
garden
and
the
lane
and
where
the
lovely
grass
is
deep
we
two
go
walking
once
again
on
silver
nights
that
banish
sleep
the
betides
all
beauty
still
is
mine
i
drink
as
did
the
old
gods
of
its
wine
though
times
should
dim
my
eyes
yet
i
have
seen
the
hills
and
hollows
gay
with
gold
and
green
roses
have
charmed
me
with
a
dear
delight
and
iris
brought
me
joy
in
cups
of
white
for
me
the
fairies
hung
on
bush
and
tree
the
marvel
of
the
frost
bright
filagree
and
well
i
know
where
at
the
grey
of
morn
they
threaded
dew
on
weed
and
thorn
lights
of
the
northern
skies
and
dancing
flames
and
flowing
seas
your
colors
have
no
names
across
the
uplands
how
you
pass
chased
by
the
filmy
shadows
on
the
grass
oh
i
have
watched
the
little
swallows
fly
down
silver
reaches
of
the
twilight
sky
while
through
the
western
gates
another
day
in
sweeping
golden
garments
passed
away
i
know
how
morning
hastening
from
afar
catches
upon
her
robes
a
star
and
often
i
have
seen
at
midnight
hour
the
blooming
of
the
moon
gold
o
look
look
out
upon
the
lovely
earth
and
take
the
gift
she
gave
thee
at
thy
birth
betides
all
beauty
still
is
thine
drink
deep
as
did
the
old
gods
of
its
wine
a
love
song
oh
haste
thee
sweet
impatient
now
i
wait
the
crescent
moon
swings
low
it
groweth
late
a
sings
of
life
and
love
and
fate
oh
haste
my
sweet
youth
and
its
gladness
goes
joy
hath
one
summer
time
like
to
the
rose
love
only
lives
through
all
the
winter
snows
so
haste
my
sweet
these
hours
are
all
our
own
but
see
a
on
the
blown
for
thee
i
wait
for
thee
i
wait
alone
so
haste
my
sweet
a
song
o
heart
of
mine
if
i
were
but
a
swallow
a
thing
so
fearless
swift
of
flight
and
free
on
wings
unwearied
i
would
find
and
follow
some
path
that
led
to
thee
were
i
a
rose
out
in
the
garden
growing
my
sweetness
i
would
give
the
vagrant
breeze
for
he
perchance
might
meet
thee
all
unknowing
yet
bring
thee
memories
the
night
of
all
saints
it
is
an
old
belief
that
on
the
night
of
all
saints
the
spirits
of
the
dead
return
so
each
year
there
is
made
a
beloved
feast
he
will
come
back
across
the
roads
unmeasured
lit
by
old
moons
and
flaming
sun
and
star
there
are
so
many
things
he
loved
and
treasured
to
call
him
from
afar
joy
of
the
distant
heaven
entrancing
never
could
charm
him
from
the
earth
he
knew
scent
of
the
music
mirth
and
dancing
he
will
come
back
to
you
he
will
come
back
no
golden
bars
can
hold
him
he
will
come
back
to
fire
and
candle
shine
he
will
be
near
though
you
may
not
behold
him
and
though
he
gives
no
sign
in
the
last
year
we
are
forgetting
all
the
old
grey
saints
a
bloom
of
dust
lies
on
the
martyrs
shrines
from
storied
windows
that
the
sunlight
paints
we
rarely
read
the
dear
familiar
lines
they
seem
a
part
of
things
so
far
away
these
haloed
ones
the
saints
of
yesterday
we
are
forgetting
all
the
ancient
lore
of
battles
with
their
unnamed
dead
all
all
have
vanished
we
will
nevermore
in
dreams
unfurl
their
banners
stained
with
red
a
has
drifted
them
away
into
the
limbo
of
life
yesterday
we
are
forgetting
all
the
mighty
men
the
knights
in
clanking
armor
of
the
past
we
care
not
that
by
forest
and
by
fen
their
fighting
done
they
soundly
slept
at
last
they
all
belong
to
grief
so
far
away
the
long
and
bitter
tears
of
yesterday
we
are
forgetting
all
the
hours
of
peace
the
sweet
hours
of
gold
on
green
the
careless
hours
we
thought
could
never
cease
the
merriest
hours
the
world
has
ever
seen
they
are
so
very
very
far
away
those
white
untroubled
hours
of
yesterday
for
death
goes
to
and
fro
upon
the
earth
it
follows
in
the
wake
of
marching
men
and
we
who
knew
the
olden
peace
and
mirth
will
never
never
know
the
same
again
the
scented
wind
across
the
boughs
of
may
brings
but
the
memory
of
some
yesterday
ships
the
great
grey
ships
we
saw
them
in
our
dreaming
the
strong
grey
ships
the
ships
of
our
desire
watched
by
the
stars
and
by
the
dawn
white
gleaming
and
followed
by
the
winds
that
never
tire
o
but
we
trusted
them
through
days
of
weeping
blessed
them
each
one
and
bid
each
one
depart
with
all
the
brave
we
gave
into
its
keeping
the
priceless
garnered
treasure
of
the
heart
long
long
they
haunted
us
when
gales
were
blowing
dim
wraiths
of
ships
like
shadows
in
the
rain
little
we
slept
on
winter
nights
of
snowing
thinking
of
those
who
might
not
sail
again
yet
dear
grey
ships
the
spirits
of
the
fearless
lost
many
a
day
beneath
the
deepest
blue
the
souls
of
mighty
sailors
bright
and
tearless
arose
from
out
the
sea
to
sail
with
you
and
not
alone
you
kept
your
banners
flying
and
not
alone
you
met
each
bitter
day
for
dauntless
ones
unseen
and
swept
outward
with
you
on
your
darkened
way
june
now
by
every
the
buttercups
blow
o
june
you
are
spendthrift
of
your
gold
green
are
the
uplands
where
the
little
lambs
go
green
and
glad
the
forests
that
are
old
once
again
the
summer
weaves
on
her
magic
loom
cloth
of
clover
fairy
web
of
wheat
only
mary
alabaster
box
of
perfume
ever
made
the
passing
wind
more
sweet
even
through
the
city
where
the
dusty
roads
run
blue
runs
now
the
river
to
the
sea
tender
is
the
twilight
when
the
long
day
is
done
infinite
the
stars
tranquillity
not
forever
are
the
rains
or
the
winter
snows
all
these
past
nor
shall
be
overlong
and
with
every
lovely
june
cometh
the
rose
the
sweet
blue
dusk
a
october
goes
october
goes
and
its
colors
pass
at
dawn
there
a
silver
film
on
the
grass
and
the
reeds
are
shining
as
pipes
of
glass
but
yesterweek
where
the
cloud
waves
rolled
down
a
sky
that
was
grey
and
cold
sailed
the
hunter
moon
a
galleon
of
gold
and
now
in
the
very
depth
of
the
night
it
is
just
a
little
flame
blown
and
white
or
a
moth
on
a
weary
flight
but
the
steadfast
trees
at
the
forest
rim
and
the
pines
in
places
scented
and
dim
still
wait
for
one
hunter
and
watch
for
him
and
the
wind
in
the
branches
whispers
why
and
the
yellow
leaves
that
go
rustling
by
say
only
remember
and
sigh
and
sigh
the
on
this
little
pool
where
the
lie
this
tawny
gold
ring
where
the
shadows
die
god
doth
enamel
the
blue
of
his
sky
through
the
scented
dark
when
the
night
wind
sighs
he
mirrors
his
stars
where
the
ripples
rise
till
they
glitter
like
prisoned
fireflies
is
here
that
the
leaves
uncurl
and
here
the
lilies
uplift
and
unfurl
their
goblets
of
carven
pearl
when
the
grey
of
the
eastern
sky
turns
pink
through
the
silver
sedge
at
the
pool
low
brink
the
little
lone
creeps
down
to
drink
and
creatures
to
whom
only
god
is
kind
the
loveless
small
things
the
slow
and
the
blind
soft
steal
through
the
rushes
and
comfort
find
oh
restless
the
river
restless
the
sea
where
the
great
ships
go
and
the
dead
men
be
the
giveth
but
peace
to
me
