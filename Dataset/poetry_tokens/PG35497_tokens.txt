three
sunsets
he
saw
her
once
and
in
the
glance
a
moment
glance
of
meeting
eyes
his
heart
stood
still
in
sudden
trance
he
trembled
with
a
sweet
surprise
all
in
the
waning
light
she
stood
the
star
of
perfect
womanhood
that
his
heart
was
light
with
lighter
step
he
trod
the
ground
and
life
was
fairer
in
his
sight
and
music
was
in
every
sound
he
blessed
the
world
where
there
could
be
so
beautiful
a
thing
as
she
there
once
again
as
evening
fell
and
stars
were
peering
overhead
two
lovers
met
to
bid
farewell
the
western
sun
gleamed
faint
and
red
lost
in
a
drift
of
purple
cloud
that
wrapped
him
like
a
long
time
the
memory
of
that
night
the
hand
that
clasped
the
lips
that
kissed
the
form
that
faded
from
his
sight
slow
sinking
through
the
tearful
mist
in
dreamy
music
seemed
to
roll
through
the
dark
chambers
of
his
soul
so
after
many
years
he
came
a
wanderer
from
a
distant
shore
the
street
the
house
were
still
the
same
but
those
he
sought
were
there
no
more
his
burning
words
his
hopes
and
fears
unheeded
fell
on
alien
ears
only
the
children
from
their
play
would
pause
the
mournful
tale
to
hear
shrinking
in
away
or
step
by
step
would
venture
near
to
touch
with
timid
curious
hands
that
strange
wild
man
from
other
lands
he
sat
beside
the
busy
street
there
where
he
last
had
seen
her
face
and
thronging
memories
seemed
yet
to
haunt
the
ancient
place
her
footfall
ever
floated
near
her
voice
was
ever
in
his
ear
he
sometimes
as
the
daylight
waned
and
evening
mists
began
to
roll
in
complained
of
that
black
shadow
on
his
soul
and
blindly
fanned
with
cruel
care
the
ashes
of
a
vain
despair
the
summer
fled
the
lonely
man
still
lingered
out
the
lessening
days
still
as
the
night
drew
on
would
scan
each
passing
face
with
closer
gaze
till
sick
at
heart
he
turned
away
and
sighed
she
will
not
come
so
by
degrees
his
spirit
bent
to
mock
its
own
despairing
cry
in
stern
to
invent
new
luxuries
of
agony
and
people
all
the
vacant
space
with
visions
of
her
perfect
face
then
for
a
moment
she
was
nigh
he
heard
no
step
but
she
was
there
as
if
an
angel
suddenly
were
bodied
from
the
viewless
air
and
all
her
fine
ethereal
frame
should
fade
as
swiftly
as
it
came
so
half
in
fancy
sunny
trance
and
half
in
misery
aching
void
with
set
and
stony
countenance
his
bitter
being
he
enjoyed
and
thrust
for
ever
from
his
mind
the
happiness
he
could
not
find
as
when
the
wretch
in
lonely
room
to
selfish
death
is
madly
hurled
the
glamour
of
that
fatal
fume
shuts
out
the
wholesome
living
world
so
all
his
manhood
strength
and
pride
one
sickly
dream
had
swept
aside
yea
brother
and
we
passed
him
there
but
yesterday
in
merry
mood
and
marveled
at
the
lordly
air
that
shamed
his
beggar
attitude
nor
heeded
that
ourselves
might
be
wretches
as
desperate
as
he
who
let
the
thought
of
bliss
denied
make
havoc
of
our
life
and
powers
and
pine
in
solitary
pride
for
peace
that
never
shall
be
ours
because
we
will
not
work
and
wait
in
trustful
patience
for
our
fate
and
so
it
chanced
once
more
that
she
came
by
the
old
familiar
spot
the
face
he
would
have
died
to
see
bent
him
and
he
knew
it
not
too
rapt
in
selfish
grief
to
hear
even
when
happiness
was
near
and
pity
filled
her
gentle
breast
for
him
that
would
not
stir
nor
speak
the
dying
crimson
of
the
west
that
faintly
tinged
his
haggard
cheek
fell
on
her
as
she
stood
and
shed
a
glory
round
the
patient
head
ah
let
him
wake
the
moments
fly
this
awful
tryst
may
be
the
last
and
see
the
tear
that
dimmed
her
eye
had
fallen
on
him
ere
she
passed
she
passed
the
crimson
paled
to
gray
and
hope
departed
with
the
day
the
heavy
hours
of
night
went
by
and
silence
quickened
into
sound
and
light
slid
up
the
eastern
sky
and
life
began
its
daily
round
but
light
and
life
for
him
were
fled
his
name
was
numbered
with
the
dead
illustration
the
path
of
roses
in
the
dark
silence
of
an
ancient
room
whose
one
tall
window
fronted
to
the
west
where
through
laced
tendrils
of
a
hanging
vine
the
was
fading
into
night
sat
a
pale
lady
resting
weary
hands
upon
a
great
clasped
volume
and
her
face
within
her
hands
not
as
in
rest
she
bowed
but
large
hot
tears
were
coursing
down
her
cheek
and
her
sobs
broke
awefully
upon
the
sleeping
echoes
of
the
night
soon
she
unclasp
the
volume
once
again
and
read
the
words
in
tone
of
agony
as
in
weeping
as
she
read
he
crowns
the
glory
of
his
race
he
prayeth
but
in
some
fit
place
to
meet
his
foeman
face
to
face
and
battling
for
the
true
the
right
from
ruddy
dawn
to
purple
night
to
perish
in
the
midmost
fight
where
hearts
are
fierce
and
hands
are
strong
where
peals
the
bugle
loud
and
long
where
blood
is
dropping
in
the
throng
still
with
a
dim
and
glazing
eye
to
watch
the
tide
of
victory
to
hear
in
death
the
then
gathered
grandly
to
his
grave
to
rest
among
the
true
and
brave
in
holy
ground
where
wave
where
from
sculptured
fair
float
out
upon
the
evening
air
the
note
of
praise
the
voice
of
prayer
where
no
vain
marble
mockery
insults
with
loud
and
boastful
lie
the
simple
soldier
memory
where
sometimes
little
children
go
and
read
in
whisper
accent
slow
the
name
of
him
who
sleeps
below
her
voice
died
out
like
one
in
dreams
she
sat
alas
she
sighed
for
what
can
woman
do
her
life
is
aimless
and
her
death
unknown
hemmed
in
by
social
forms
she
pines
in
vain
man
has
his
work
but
what
can
woman
do
and
answer
came
there
from
the
creeping
gloom
the
creeping
gloom
that
settled
into
night
peace
for
thy
lot
is
other
than
a
man
his
is
a
path
of
thorns
he
beats
them
down
he
faces
death
he
wrestles
with
despair
thine
is
of
roses
to
adorn
and
cheer
his
lonely
life
and
hide
the
thorns
in
flowers
she
spake
again
in
bitter
tone
she
spake
aye
as
a
toy
the
puppet
of
an
hour
or
a
fair
posy
newly
plucked
at
morn
but
flung
aside
and
withered
ere
the
night
and
answer
came
there
from
the
creeping
gloom
the
creeping
gloom
that
blackened
into
night
so
shalt
thou
be
the
lamp
to
light
his
path
what
time
the
shades
of
sorrow
close
around
and
so
it
seemed
to
her
an
awful
light
pierced
slowly
through
the
darkness
orbed
and
grew
until
all
passed
away
the
ancient
room
the
sunlight
dying
through
the
trellised
vine
the
one
tall
window
all
had
passed
away
and
she
was
standing
on
the
mighty
hills
beneath
around
and
far
as
eye
could
see
squadron
on
squadron
stretched
opposing
hosts
ranked
as
for
battle
mute
and
motionless
anon
a
distant
thunder
shook
the
ground
the
tramp
of
horses
and
a
troop
shot
by
plunged
headlong
in
that
living
sea
of
men
plunged
to
their
death
back
from
that
fatal
field
a
scattered
handful
fighting
hard
for
life
broke
through
the
serried
lines
but
as
she
gazed
they
shrank
and
melted
and
their
forms
grew
thin
grew
pale
as
ghosts
when
the
first
morning
ray
dawns
from
the
east
the
trumpet
brazen
blare
died
into
silence
and
the
vision
passed
passed
to
a
room
where
sick
and
dying
lay
in
long
sad
line
there
brooded
fear
and
pain
darkness
was
there
the
shade
of
azrael
wing
but
there
was
one
that
ever
to
and
fro
moved
with
light
footfall
purely
calm
her
face
and
those
deep
steadfast
eyes
that
starred
the
gloom
still
as
she
went
she
ministered
to
each
comfort
and
counsel
cooled
the
fevered
brow
with
softest
touch
and
in
the
listening
ear
of
the
pale
sufferer
whispered
words
of
peace
the
dying
warrior
gazing
as
she
passed
clasped
his
thin
hands
and
blessed
her
bless
her
too
thou
who
didst
bless
the
merciful
of
old
so
prayed
the
lady
watching
tearfully
her
gentle
moving
onward
till
the
night
had
veiled
her
wholly
and
the
vision
passed
then
once
again
the
solemn
whisper
came
so
in
the
darkest
path
of
man
despair
where
war
and
terror
shake
the
troubled
earth
lies
woman
mission
with
unblenching
brow
to
pass
through
scenes
of
horror
and
affright
where
men
grow
sick
and
tremble
unto
her
all
things
are
sanctified
for
all
are
good
nothing
so
mean
but
shall
deserve
her
care
nothing
so
great
but
she
may
bear
her
part
no
life
is
vain
each
hath
his
place
assigned
do
thou
thy
task
and
leave
the
rest
to
god
and
there
was
silence
but
the
lady
made
no
answer
save
one
amen
and
she
arose
and
in
that
darkening
room
stood
lonely
as
a
spirit
of
the
night
stood
calm
and
fearless
in
the
gathered
night
and
raised
her
eyes
to
heaven
there
were
tears
upon
her
face
but
in
her
heart
was
peace
peace
that
the
world
nor
gives
nor
takes
away
illustration
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
hark
the
dying
to
that
complaining
tone
like
sprite
condemned
each
eventide
to
walk
the
world
alone
at
sunset
when
the
air
is
still
i
hear
it
creep
from
yonder
hill
it
breathes
upon
me
dead
and
chill
a
moment
and
is
gone
my
son
it
minds
me
of
a
day
left
half
a
life
behind
that
i
have
prayed
to
put
away
for
ever
from
my
mind
but
bitter
memory
will
not
die
it
haunts
my
soul
when
none
is
nigh
i
hear
its
whisper
in
the
sigh
of
that
complaining
wind
and
now
in
death
my
soul
is
fain
to
tell
the
tale
of
fear
that
hidden
in
my
breast
hath
lain
through
many
a
weary
year
yet
time
would
fail
to
utter
all
the
evil
spells
that
held
me
thrall
and
thrust
my
life
from
fall
to
fall
thou
needest
not
to
hear
the
spells
that
bound
me
with
a
chain
sin
stern
behests
to
do
till
pleasure
self
invoked
in
vain
a
heavy
burden
grew
till
from
my
spirit
fevered
eye
a
hunted
thing
i
seemed
to
fly
through
the
dark
woods
that
underlie
yon
of
blue
deep
in
those
woods
i
found
a
vale
no
sunlight
visiteth
nor
star
nor
wandering
moonbeam
pale
where
never
comes
the
breath
of
there
in
mine
ear
even
as
i
lingered
half
in
fear
i
heard
a
whisper
cold
and
clear
this
is
the
gate
of
death
o
bitter
is
it
to
abide
in
weariness
alway
at
dawn
to
sigh
for
eventide
at
eventide
for
day
thy
noon
hath
fled
thy
sun
hath
shone
the
brightness
of
thy
day
is
gone
what
need
to
lag
and
linger
on
till
life
be
cold
and
gray
o
well
it
said
beneath
yon
pool
in
some
still
cavern
deep
the
fevered
brain
might
slumber
cool
the
eyes
forget
to
weep
within
that
goblet
mystic
rim
are
draughts
of
healing
stored
for
him
whose
heart
is
sick
whose
sight
is
dim
who
prayeth
but
to
sleep
the
went
moaning
by
like
mourner
for
the
dead
and
stirred
with
shrill
complaining
sigh
the
overhead
my
seemed
to
stand
and
mutely
wave
a
warning
hand
with
sudden
terror
all
unmanned
i
turned
myself
and
fled
a
stood
open
wide
soft
fell
the
dying
ray
on
two
fair
children
side
by
side
that
rested
from
their
play
together
bent
the
earnest
head
as
ever
and
anon
they
read
from
one
dear
book
the
words
they
said
come
back
to
me
like
twin
cascades
on
together
wandered
down
the
ripples
of
the
golden
hair
the
ripples
of
the
brown
while
through
the
tangled
silken
haze
blue
eyes
looked
forth
in
eager
gaze
more
starlike
than
the
gems
that
blaze
about
a
monarch
crown
my
son
there
comes
to
each
an
hour
when
sinks
the
spirit
pride
when
weary
hands
forget
their
power
the
strokes
of
death
to
guide
in
such
a
moment
warriors
say
a
word
the
may
stay
a
sudden
charge
redeem
the
day
and
turn
the
living
tide
i
could
not
see
for
blinding
tears
the
glories
of
the
west
a
heavenly
music
filled
mine
ears
a
heavenly
peace
my
breast
come
unto
me
come
unto
me
all
ye
that
labour
unto
me
ye
come
to
me
and
i
will
give
you
rest
the
night
drew
onward
thin
and
blue
the
evening
mists
arise
to
bathe
the
thirsty
land
in
dew
as
erst
in
paradise
while
over
silent
field
and
town
the
deep
blue
vault
of
heaven
looked
down
not
as
of
old
in
angry
frown
but
bright
with
angels
eyes
blest
day
then
first
i
heard
the
voice
that
since
hath
oft
beguiled
these
eyes
from
tears
and
bid
rejoice
this
heart
with
anguish
wild
thy
mother
boy
thou
hast
not
known
so
soon
she
left
me
here
to
moan
left
me
to
weep
and
watch
alone
our
one
beloved
child
though
parted
from
my
aching
sight
like
dove
she
passed
into
the
perfect
light
that
floods
the
world
above
yet
our
twin
spirits
well
i
know
though
one
abide
in
pain
below
love
as
in
summers
long
ago
and
evermore
shall
love
so
with
a
glad
and
patient
heart
i
move
toward
mine
end
the
streams
that
flow
awhile
apart
shall
both
in
ocean
blend
i
dare
not
weep
i
can
but
bless
the
love
that
pitied
my
distress
and
lent
me
in
life
wilderness
so
sweet
and
true
a
friend
but
if
there
be
o
if
there
be
a
truth
in
what
they
say
that
we
can
not
see
go
with
us
on
our
way
then
surely
she
is
with
me
here
i
dimly
feel
her
spirit
near
the
grow
thin
and
clear
and
death
brings
in
the
day
illustration
solitude
i
love
the
stillness
of
the
wood
i
love
the
music
of
the
rill
i
love
to
couch
in
pensive
mood
upon
some
silent
hill
scarce
heard
beneath
yon
arching
trees
the
ripples
pass
and
like
a
mimic
brook
the
breeze
whispers
among
the
grass
here
from
the
world
i
win
release
nor
scorn
of
men
nor
footstep
rude
break
in
to
mar
the
holy
peace
of
this
great
solitude
here
may
the
silent
tears
i
weep
lull
the
vexed
spirit
into
rest
as
infants
sob
themselves
to
sleep
upon
a
mother
breast
but
when
the
bitter
hour
is
gone
and
the
keen
throbbing
pangs
are
still
oh
sweetest
then
to
couch
alone
upon
some
silent
hill
to
live
in
joys
that
once
have
been
to
put
the
cold
world
out
of
sight
and
deck
life
drear
and
barren
scene
with
hues
of
for
what
to
man
the
gift
of
breath
if
sorrow
be
his
lot
below
if
all
the
day
that
ends
in
death
be
dark
with
clouds
of
woe
shall
the
poor
transport
of
an
hour
repay
long
years
of
sore
distress
the
fragrance
of
a
lonely
flower
make
glad
the
wilderness
ye
golden
hours
of
life
young
spring
of
innocence
of
love
and
truth
bright
beyond
all
imagining
thou
of
youth
i
give
all
wealth
that
years
have
piled
the
slow
result
of
life
decay
to
be
once
more
a
little
child
for
one
bright
far
away
he
stept
so
lightly
to
the
land
all
in
his
manly
pride
he
kissed
her
cheek
he
clasped
her
hand
yet
still
she
glanced
aside
too
gay
he
seems
she
darkly
dreams
too
gallant
and
too
gay
to
think
of
me
poor
simple
me
when
he
is
far
away
i
bring
my
love
this
goodly
pearl
across
the
seas
he
said
a
gem
to
deck
the
dearest
girl
that
ever
sailor
wed
she
holds
it
tight
her
eyes
are
bright
her
throbbing
heart
would
say
he
thought
of
me
he
thought
of
me
when
he
was
far
away
the
ship
has
sailed
into
the
west
her
is
flown
a
dull
dead
pain
is
in
her
breast
and
she
is
weak
and
lone
but
there
a
smile
upon
her
face
a
smile
that
seems
to
say
he
think
of
me
he
think
of
me
when
he
is
far
away
though
waters
wide
between
us
glide
our
lives
are
warm
and
near
no
distance
parts
two
faithful
hearts
two
hearts
that
love
so
dear
and
i
will
trust
my
for
ever
and
a
day
to
think
of
me
to
think
of
me
when
he
is
far
away
illustration
beatrice
in
her
eyes
is
the
living
light
of
a
wanderer
to
earth
from
a
far
celestial
height
summers
five
are
all
the
span
summers
five
since
time
began
to
veil
in
mists
of
human
night
a
shining
does
an
angel
look
from
her
eyes
will
she
suddenly
spring
away
and
soar
to
her
home
in
the
skies
beatrice
blessing
and
blessed
to
be
beatrice
still
as
i
gaze
on
thee
visions
of
two
sweet
maids
arise
whose
life
was
of
yesterday
of
a
beatrice
pale
and
stern
with
the
lips
of
a
dumb
despair
with
the
innocent
eyes
that
yearn
yearn
for
the
young
sweet
hours
of
life
far
from
sorrow
and
far
from
strife
for
the
happy
summers
that
never
return
when
the
world
seemed
good
and
fair
of
a
beatrice
glorious
bright
of
a
sainted
ethereal
maid
whose
blue
eyes
are
deep
fountains
of
light
cheering
the
poet
that
broodeth
apart
filling
with
gladness
his
desolate
heart
like
the
moon
when
she
shines
thro
a
cloudless
night
on
a
world
of
silence
and
shade
and
the
visions
waver
and
faint
and
the
visions
vanish
away
that
my
fancy
delighted
to
paint
she
is
here
at
my
side
a
living
child
with
the
glowing
cheek
and
the
tresses
wild
nor
martyr
nor
radiant
saint
yet
stainless
and
bright
as
they
for
i
think
if
a
grim
wild
beast
were
to
come
from
his
from
his
in
the
east
stealthily
creeping
with
bated
breath
stealthily
creeping
with
eyes
of
death
he
would
all
forget
his
dream
of
the
feast
and
crouch
at
her
feet
a
slave
she
would
twine
her
hand
in
his
mane
she
would
prattle
in
silvery
tone
like
the
tinkle
of
questioning
him
with
her
laughing
eyes
questioning
him
with
a
glad
surprise
till
she
caught
from
those
fierce
eyes
again
the
love
that
lit
her
own
and
be
sure
if
a
savage
heart
in
a
mask
of
human
guise
were
to
come
on
her
here
apart
bound
for
a
dark
and
a
deadly
deed
hurrying
past
with
pitiless
speed
he
would
suddenly
falter
and
guiltily
start
at
the
glance
of
her
pure
blue
eyes
nay
be
sure
if
an
angel
fair
a
bright
seraph
undefiled
were
to
stoop
from
the
trackless
air
fain
would
she
linger
in
glad
amaze
lovingly
linger
to
ponder
and
gaze
with
a
sister
love
and
a
sister
care
on
the
happy
innocent
child
illustration
stolen
waters
the
light
was
faint
and
soft
the
air
that
breathed
around
the
place
and
she
was
lithe
and
tall
and
fair
and
with
a
wayward
grace
her
queenly
head
she
bare
with
glowing
cheek
with
gleaming
eye
she
met
me
on
the
way
my
spirit
owned
the
witchery
within
her
smile
that
lay
i
followed
her
i
knew
not
why
the
trees
were
thick
with
many
a
fruit
the
grass
with
many
a
flower
my
soul
was
dead
my
tongue
was
mute
in
that
accursëd
hour
and
in
my
dream
with
silvery
voice
she
said
or
seemed
to
say
youth
is
the
season
to
rejoice
i
could
not
choose
but
stay
i
could
not
say
her
nay
she
plucked
a
branch
above
her
head
with
rarest
fruitage
laden
drink
of
the
juice
sir
knight
she
said
is
good
for
knight
and
maiden
oh
blind
mine
eye
that
would
not
trace
oh
deaf
mine
ear
that
would
not
heed
the
mocking
smile
upon
her
face
the
mocking
voice
of
greed
i
drank
the
juice
and
straightway
felt
a
fire
within
my
brain
my
soul
within
me
seemed
to
melt
in
sweet
delirious
pain
sweet
is
the
stolen
draught
she
said
hath
sweetness
stint
or
measure
pleasant
the
secret
hoard
of
bread
what
bars
us
from
our
pleasure
yea
take
we
pleasure
while
we
may
i
heard
myself
replying
in
the
red
sunset
far
away
my
happier
life
was
dying
my
heart
was
sad
my
voice
was
gay
and
unawares
i
knew
not
how
i
kissed
her
dainty
i
kissed
her
on
the
lily
brow
i
kissed
her
on
the
false
false
lips
that
burning
kiss
i
feel
it
now
true
love
gives
true
love
of
the
best
then
take
i
cried
my
heart
to
thee
the
very
heart
from
out
my
breast
i
plucked
i
gave
it
willingly
her
very
heart
she
gave
to
me
then
died
the
glory
from
the
west
in
the
gray
light
i
saw
her
face
and
it
was
withered
old
and
gray
the
flowers
were
fading
in
their
place
were
fading
with
the
fading
day
forth
from
her
like
a
hunted
deer
through
all
that
ghastly
night
i
fled
and
still
behind
me
seemed
to
hear
her
fierce
unflagging
tread
and
scarce
drew
breath
for
fear
yet
marked
i
well
how
strangely
seemed
the
heart
within
my
breast
to
sleep
silent
it
lay
or
so
i
dreamed
with
never
a
throb
or
leap
for
hers
was
now
my
heart
she
said
the
heart
that
once
had
been
mine
own
and
in
my
breast
i
bore
instead
a
cold
cold
heart
of
stone
so
grew
the
morning
overhead
the
sun
shot
downward
through
the
trees
his
old
familiar
flame
all
ancient
sounds
upon
the
breeze
from
copse
and
meadow
came
but
i
was
not
the
same
they
call
me
mad
i
smile
i
weep
uncaring
how
or
why
yea
when
one
heart
is
laid
asleep
what
better
than
to
die
so
that
the
grave
be
dark
and
deep
to
die
to
die
and
yet
methinks
i
drink
of
life
deep
as
the
thirsty
traveler
drinks
of
fountain
by
the
way
my
voice
is
sad
my
heart
is
gay
when
yestereve
was
on
the
wane
i
heard
a
clear
voice
singing
so
sweetly
that
like
my
happy
tears
came
springing
my
human
heart
returned
again
a
rosy
child
sitting
and
singing
in
a
garden
fair
the
joy
of
hearing
seeing
the
simple
joy
of
being
or
twining
rosebuds
in
the
golden
hair
that
ripples
free
and
wild
a
sweet
pale
child
wearily
looking
to
the
purple
west
waiting
the
great
that
suddenly
shall
sever
the
cruel
chains
that
hold
her
from
her
rest
by
unbeguiled
an
gazing
with
living
eyes
on
a
dead
face
the
mortal
form
forsaken
that
none
may
now
awaken
that
lieth
painless
moveless
in
her
place
as
though
in
death
she
smiled
be
as
a
child
so
shalt
thou
sing
for
very
joy
of
breath
so
shalt
thou
wait
thy
dying
in
holy
transport
lying
so
pass
rejoicing
through
the
gate
of
death
in
garment
undefiled
then
call
me
what
they
will
i
know
that
now
my
soul
is
glad
if
this
be
madness
better
so
far
better
to
be
mad
weeping
or
smiling
as
i
go
for
if
i
weep
it
is
that
now
i
see
how
deep
a
loss
is
mine
and
feel
how
brightly
round
my
brow
the
coronal
might
shine
had
i
but
kept
mine
early
vow
and
if
i
smile
it
is
that
now
i
see
the
promise
of
the
years
the
garland
waiting
for
my
brow
that
must
be
won
with
tears
with
pain
with
death
i
care
not
how
illustration
the
the
morn
was
bright
the
steeds
were
light
the
wedding
guests
were
gay
young
ellen
stood
within
the
wood
and
watched
them
pass
away
she
scarcely
saw
the
gallant
train
the
dimmed
her
ee
unheard
the
maiden
did
complain
beneath
the
oh
robin
thou
didst
love
me
well
till
on
a
bitter
day
she
came
the
lady
isabel
and
stole
thy
heart
away
my
tears
are
vain
i
live
again
in
days
that
used
to
be
when
i
could
meet
thy
welcome
feet
beneath
the
oh
willow
gray
i
may
not
stay
till
spring
renew
thy
leaf
but
i
will
hide
myself
away
and
nurse
a
lonely
grief
it
shall
not
dim
life
joy
for
him
my
tears
he
shall
not
see
while
he
is
by
i
come
not
nigh
my
weeping
but
when
i
die
oh
let
me
lie
beneath
thy
loving
shade
that
he
may
loiter
careless
by
where
i
am
lowly
laid
and
let
the
white
white
marble
tell
if
he
should
stoop
to
see
lies
a
maid
that
loved
thee
well
beneath
the
only
a
woman
hair
a
woman
hair
fling
it
aside
a
bubble
on
life
mighty
stream
heed
it
not
man
but
watch
the
broadening
tide
bright
with
the
western
beam
nay
in
those
words
there
rings
from
other
years
the
echo
of
a
long
low
cry
where
a
proud
spirit
wrestles
with
its
tears
in
loneliest
agony
and
as
i
touch
that
lock
strange
visions
throng
upon
my
soul
with
dreamy
grace
of
woman
hair
the
theme
of
poet
song
in
every
time
and
place
a
child
bright
tresses
by
the
breezes
kissed
to
sweet
disorder
as
she
flies
veiling
beneath
a
cloud
of
golden
mist
flushed
cheek
and
laughing
eyes
or
fringing
like
a
shadow
the
glory
of
a
face
or
from
a
gipsy
sunny
brow
tossed
back
in
wild
and
wanton
grace
or
on
the
hoary
head
of
age
whose
tale
of
life
is
told
or
last
in
dreams
i
make
my
pilgrimage
to
bethany
of
old
i
see
the
feast
the
purple
and
the
gold
the
gathering
crowd
of
pharisees
whose
scornful
eyes
are
centred
to
behold
yon
woman
on
her
knees
the
stifled
sob
rings
strangely
on
mine
ears
wrung
from
the
depth
of
sin
despair
and
still
she
bathes
the
sacred
feet
with
tears
and
wipes
them
with
her
hair
he
scorned
not
then
the
simple
loving
deed
of
her
the
lowest
and
the
last
then
scorn
not
thou
but
use
with
earnest
heed
this
relic
of
the
past
the
eyes
that
loved
it
once
no
longer
wake
so
lay
it
by
with
reverent
care
touching
it
tenderly
for
sorrow
sake
it
is
a
woman
hair
illustration
the
sailor
wife
see
there
are
tears
upon
her
face
tears
newly
shed
and
scarcely
dried
close
in
an
agonised
embrace
she
clasps
the
infant
at
her
side
peace
dwells
in
those
eyes
those
parted
lips
that
faintly
smile
peace
the
foretaste
of
paradise
in
heart
too
young
for
care
or
guile
no
peace
that
mother
features
wear
but
quivering
lip
and
knotted
brow
and
broken
mutterings
all
declare
the
fearful
dream
that
haunts
her
now
the
rushing
through
the
sky
wails
from
the
depths
of
cloudy
space
shrill
piercing
as
the
seaman
cry
when
death
and
he
are
face
to
face
familiar
tones
are
in
the
gale
they
ring
upon
her
startled
ear
and
quick
and
low
she
pants
the
tale
that
tells
of
agony
and
fear
still
that
is
nigh
with
a
vexed
and
motion
all
beneath
an
angry
sky
rocking
on
an
angry
ocean
round
the
straining
mast
and
shrouds
throng
the
spirits
of
the
storm
darkly
seen
through
driving
clouds
bends
each
gaunt
and
ghastly
form
see
the
good
ship
yields
at
last
dumbly
yields
and
fights
no
more
driving
in
the
frantic
blast
headlong
on
the
fatal
shore
hark
i
hear
her
battered
side
with
a
low
and
sullen
shock
dashed
amid
the
foaming
tide
full
upon
a
sunken
rock
his
face
shines
out
against
the
sky
like
a
ghost
so
cold
and
white
with
a
dead
despairing
eye
gazing
through
the
gathered
night
is
he
watching
through
the
dark
where
a
mocking
ghostly
hand
points
a
faint
and
feeble
spark
glimmering
from
the
distant
land
sees
he
in
this
hour
of
dread
hearth
and
home
and
wife
and
child
loved
ones
who
in
summers
fled
clung
to
him
and
wept
and
smiled
reeling
sinks
the
fated
bark
to
her
tomb
beneath
the
wave
must
he
perish
in
the
dark
not
a
hand
stretched
out
to
save
see
the
spirits
how
they
crowd
watching
death
with
eyes
that
burn
waves
rush
in
she
shrieks
aloud
ere
her
waking
sense
return
the
storm
is
gone
the
skies
are
clear
hush
is
that
bitter
cry
of
pain
the
only
sound
that
meets
her
ear
the
heaving
of
the
sullen
main
though
heaviness
endure
the
night
yet
joy
shall
come
with
break
of
day
she
shudders
with
a
strange
delight
the
fearful
dream
is
pass
away
she
wakes
the
grey
dawn
streaks
the
dark
with
early
song
the
copses
ring
far
off
she
hears
the
bark
a
joyful
bark
of
welcoming
illustration
after
three
days
i
stood
within
the
gate
of
a
great
temple
the
living
stream
of
worshipers
that
thronged
its
regal
state
in
my
dream
jewels
and
gold
were
there
and
floors
of
marble
lent
a
crystal
sheen
to
body
forth
as
in
a
lower
air
the
wonders
of
the
scene
such
wild
and
lavish
grace
had
whispers
in
it
of
a
coming
doom
as
richest
flowers
lie
strown
about
the
face
of
her
that
waits
the
tomb
the
wisest
of
the
land
had
gathered
there
three
solemn
for
high
debate
men
stood
on
either
hand
to
listen
and
to
gaze
the
aged
brows
were
bent
bent
to
a
frown
half
thought
and
half
annoy
that
all
their
stores
of
subtlest
argument
were
baffled
by
a
boy
in
each
averted
face
i
marked
but
scorn
and
loathing
till
mine
eyes
fell
upon
one
that
stirred
not
in
his
place
tranced
in
a
dumb
surprise
surely
within
his
mind
strange
thoughts
are
born
until
he
doubts
the
lore
of
those
old
men
blind
leaders
of
the
blind
whose
kingdom
is
no
more
surely
he
sees
afar
a
day
of
death
the
stormy
future
brings
the
crimson
setting
of
the
that
led
the
eastern
kings
thus
as
a
sunless
deep
mirrors
the
shining
heights
that
crown
the
bay
so
did
my
soul
create
anew
in
sleep
the
picture
seen
by
day
gazers
came
and
went
a
restless
hum
of
voices
marked
the
spot
in
varying
shades
of
critic
discontent
prating
they
knew
not
what
where
is
the
comely
limb
the
form
attuned
in
every
perfect
part
the
beauty
that
we
should
desire
in
him
ah
fools
and
slow
of
heart
look
into
those
deep
eyes
deep
as
the
grave
and
strong
with
love
divine
those
tender
pure
and
fathomless
mysteries
that
seem
to
pierce
through
thine
look
into
those
deep
eyes
stirred
to
unrest
by
breath
of
coming
strife
until
a
longing
in
thy
soul
arise
that
this
indeed
were
life
that
thou
couldst
find
him
there
bend
at
his
sacred
feet
thy
willing
knee
and
from
thy
heart
pour
out
the
passionate
prayer
lord
let
me
follow
thee
but
see
the
crowd
divide
mother
and
sire
have
found
their
lost
one
now
the
gentle
voice
that
fain
would
seem
to
chide
whispers
son
why
hast
thou
in
tone
of
sad
amaze
thus
dealt
with
us
that
art
our
dearest
thing
behold
thy
sire
and
i
three
weary
days
have
sought
thee
sorrowing
and
i
had
stayed
to
hear
the
loving
words
how
is
it
that
ye
sought
but
that
the
sudden
lark
with
matins
clear
severed
the
links
of
thought
then
over
all
there
fell
shadow
and
silence
and
my
dream
was
fled
as
fade
the
phantoms
of
a
wizard
cell
when
the
dark
charm
is
said
yet
in
the
gathering
light
i
lay
with
eyes
that
would
not
wake
lovingly
clinging
to
the
skirts
of
night
for
that
sweet
vision
sake
illustration
faces
in
the
fire
the
night
creeps
onward
sad
and
slow
in
these
red
embers
dying
glow
the
forms
of
fancy
come
and
go
an
broad
seas
of
corn
stirred
by
the
wandering
breath
of
morn
the
happy
spot
where
i
was
born
the
picture
fadeth
in
its
place
amid
the
glow
i
seem
to
trace
the
shifting
semblance
of
a
face
is
now
a
little
childish
form
red
lips
for
kisses
pouted
warm
and
tangled
in
the
storm
is
now
a
grave
and
gentle
maid
at
her
own
beauty
half
afraid
shrinking
and
willing
to
be
stayed
oh
time
was
young
and
life
was
warm
when
first
i
saw
that
her
dark
hair
tossing
in
the
storm
and
fast
and
free
these
pulses
played
when
last
i
met
that
gentle
maid
when
last
her
hand
in
mine
was
laid
those
locks
of
jet
are
turned
to
gray
and
she
is
strange
and
far
away
that
might
have
been
mine
own
that
might
have
been
mine
own
my
dear
through
many
and
many
a
happy
year
that
might
have
sat
beside
me
here
ay
changeless
through
the
changing
scene
the
ghostly
whisper
rings
between
the
dark
refrain
of
have
been
the
race
is
i
might
have
run
the
deeds
are
past
i
might
have
done
and
sere
the
wreath
i
might
have
won
sunk
is
the
last
faint
flickering
blaze
the
vision
of
departed
days
is
vanished
even
as
i
gaze
the
pictures
with
their
ruddy
light
are
changed
to
dust
and
ashes
white
and
i
am
left
alone

a

books
in

invite
us
to
our
task

there
one
verb
when
once
we
know
no

skill
we
ask
this

all
other
lore
above
we
learned

so
hour
by
hour
from

to

we
sip
the
sweets
of
life
till
all
too
soon
the
clouds
arise
and
flaming
cheeks
and
flashing
eyes
proclaim
the
dawn
of
strife
with
half
a
smile
and
half
a
sigh
bitter
one
we
cry
last
night
we
owned
with
looks
forlorn
too
well
the
scholar
knows
there
is
no
rose
without
a
thorn
but
peace
is
made
we
sing
this
morn
no
thorn
without
a
rose
our
latin
lesson
is
complete
we
learned
that
love
is
puck
lost
and
found
puck
has
fled
the
haunts
of
men
ridicule
has
made
him
wary
in
the
woods
and
down
the
glen
no
one
meets
a
fairy
cream
the
greedy
goblin
cries
empties
the
deserted
dairy
steals
the
spoons
and
off
he
flies
still
we
seek
our
fairy
ah
what
form
is
entering
lovelit
eyes
and
laughter
airy
is
not
this
a
better
thing
child
whose
visit
thus
i
sing
even
than
a

puck
has
ventured
back

a
song
of
love
say
what
is
the
spell
when
her
fledgelings
are
cheeping
that
lures
the
bird
home
to
her
nest
or
wakes
the
tired
mother
whose
infant
is
weeping
to
cuddle
and
croon
it
to
rest
what
the
magic
that
charms
the
glad
babe
in
her
arms
till
it
cooes
with
the
voice
of
the
dove
is
a
secret
and
so
let
us
whisper
it
low
and
the
name
of
the
secret
is
love
for
i
think
it
is
love
for
i
feel
it
is
love
for
i
sure
it
is
nothing
but
love
say
whence
is
the
voice
that
when
anger
is
burning
bids
the
whirl
of
the
tempest
to
cease
that
stirs
the
vexed
soul
with
an
aching
a
yearning
for
the
brotherly
of
peace
whence
the
music
that
fills
all
our
being
that
thrills
around
us
beneath
and
above
is
a
secret
none
knows
how
it
comes
how
it
goes
but
the
name
of
the
secret
is
love
for
i
think
it
is
love
for
i
feel
it
is
love
for
i
sure
it
is
nothing
but
love

whose
is
the
skill
that
paints
valley

hill
like
a
picture
so
fair
to
the
sight
that
flecks
the
green
meadow
with
sunshine
and
shadow
till
the
little
lambs
leap
with
delight
is
a
secret
untold
to
hearts
cruel
and
cold
though
is
sung
by
the
angels
above
in
notes
that
ring
clear
for
the
ears
that
