noon
beseech
thee
follow

into

the

for
feet
grown
weary
of
the
thridded

that
echoes
ever
to
the
ceaseless
beat
of
human
tread
a
brief
while
know
the
ease
of
dreamful
rest
to
languors
stilled
on

some

that
a

a

of
gold
by

puck
or

ariel

old
oaks

open

their

the

here
are
fairies
hid

there
fleeing
from
pursuing
fauns
and
naiads
fleshed
with
hues
of
rosy
dawns
lie
dreaming
by
white
streams
in

dells
we
tread
dim

untrod

the

ringing
clear

faint
elusive
thin

i
hear
the

the

the
cardinal
a
wingèd
scarlet
flower
sprays
all
the

a
golden
shower
of

i
stand
at

close

my

on

prone
in

lies
the

still
shouting
his
shibboleth
to
the
treacherous

fate
and
her
grisly
comrade
death
to
have
lived
to
have

in

that
thrills
to
the
sound
of
strife
to
have
wrested
success
from
defeat
to

striven

won
shall
this
seem
a
small
thing
think
you
when
the
battle
of
ages
is
done
to
have
loved
to
have
known
of
all
raptures
the
rapture
supernal

the

of
your

your

pressed

hurl
my
challenging
gauntlet
full
in

fate
may
make

of
a

how
can
she
alter
the

i
have
tasted
the

of

chalice
why
shrink
from

how

cavil
at

in

yet
upon
the
meads
where
we
were
wont
to
stray
with
springtime
hopes
the
winter
hours
the
spring
has
smiled
yon
slope
that
late
gloomed
gray
and
sternly
sad
april
tender
showers
grows
green
and
glad
again
the
rippled
grass
a
soundless
sea
which
white
pass
breaks
at
my
feet
in
billows
foamed
with
flowers
and
myrtle
blooms
with
lashes
wet
smile
to
me
thro
their
tears
the
skies
are
blue
and
life
is
sweet
and
hope
seems
true
my
heart
is
barren
of
its
long
regret
and
yet
the
willow
wears
a
wistful
green
a
dream
of
summer
warmth
the
breezes
hold
fair
wildings
blow
bright
buttercups
agleam

me
forget
long
striving
to
forget
for
life
is
sweet
and
hope
seems
true
and
yet
the
mute
was
the
mighty
organ
none
might
break
the
silence
that
had
thralled
it
since
was
stilled
the
beneath
whose
touch
it
thrilled
to
music
such
as
choiring
seraphs
make
until
a
mightier
master
came
to
wake
th
elusive
chords
and
subtle
harmonies
that
lay
imprisoned
in
the
cold
white
keys
and
once
again
the
soul
of
music
spake
methought
my
soul
most
perfect
melodies
no
hand
again
to
sonance
could
evoke
a
silent
harp
whose
potence
none
might
prove
but
lo
one
came
who
swept
its
chords
and
woke
celestial
strains
divinest
harmonies
responsive
to
the
of
love
afterbloom
gay
was
her
garden
as
some
gorgeous

upon
the
sward
quaint
blossoms
wrought
broidery
of
bloom
verbenas
dahlias

scarlet
cannas
like
torches
flaming
tall
methought
the
fair
old
face
enframed
in
silver
the
sweetest
flower
of
all
and
one
rare
rose
she
watched
each
year
with
hoping
till
the
dear
eyes
grew
dim
but
ere
a
single
blossom
burst
in
beauty
god
took
her
home
to
him
yet
when
the
spring
next
woke
the
earth
to
laughter
and
boon
of
blossom
gave
starred
was
the
rose
with
white
unearthly
flowers
we
laid
them
on
her
grave
and
so
meseems
the
buds
we
woo
most
fondly
nor
light
nor
perfume
shed
and
love
rose
and
hope
oft
bloom
when
we
are
dead

carman
great
hearted
brother
to
the

comrade

ere
the

thrills
the

from
sullen
stress
of
winter
spell
away
from
throngèd
press
of
urban
ways
thy
wild
feet
wander
far
tracking
the
steps
of
some
white
northern
star
whose
rays
are
beacon
to
thy
restlessness
weird
mystic
of
the
northland
mystery
thou
the
unseen
shadow
nor

meet
the
scarlet
hunter
on

pagan
as

all
things
sylvan
dear
nature
own
vagrant
buoyant
driftless
free
all
winds
and
woods
and
waters
cry
thee
hail
when
love
passed
by
i
dreamt
of
love
in
the
golden
glory
of
youth
unshadowed
by
cloud
or
care
steeped
in
the
of
song
and
story
i
said
my
love
shall
be
wondrous
fair
i
said
her
hands
shall
be
filled
with
flowers
my
heart
shall
tell
me
when
love
draws
nigh
she
shall
steal
sweet
boon
from
the
graceless
hours
her
eyes
shall
be
blue
as
the
cerule
sky
her
hair
shall
be
bright
as
the
stars
gold
gleaming
her
lips
shall
be
red
with
her
heart
rich
wine
her
face
shall
be
fair
as
my
fondest
dreaming
each
pulse
of
my
being
shall
call
her
mine
then
long
for
the
voice
of
my
heart
i
harkened
tranced
in
love
hoping
all
hope
else
forgot
i
waited
lonely
the
daylight
darkened
the
twilight
deepened
but
love
came
not
then
one
passed
by
in
the
dusking
shadows
the
night
dusk
shadows
slept
on
her
hair
she
passed
like
a
gleam
the
meadows
and
my
heart
throbbed
fast
but
she
was
not
fair
her
face
was
pale
and
her
dark
eyes
pleading
her
smile
was
wistful
and
gravely
sweet
she
passed
me
by
where
i
stood
unheeding
and
dropped
a
violet
at
my
feet
she
went
her
way
the
silent
meadows
ah
traitorous
heart
that
you
tricked
me
so
i
sat
alone
in
the
deepening
shadows
love
had
passed
by
and
i
did
not
know
hedonism
since
we
must
sleep
the
endless
sleep
at
last
since
life
grim
juggernaut
ruthless
wheels
crushes
the
heart
since
age
like
winter
steals
on
youth
fields
with
blighting
blast
then
to
the
gods
our
doubts
and
fears
be
cast
enough
of
sorrow
joyance
is
our
due
gather
the
roses
spurn
th
envenomed
rue
fling
to
the
waiting
winds
the
pallid
past
steep
thee
in
mellow
moods
and
dear
desires
pluck
love
flower
ere
it
dies
cull
nectared
kisses
sweet
as
morning
breath
warm
chastity
at
passion
purple
fires
nepenthe
quaff
till
drained
the
chalice
lies
after
the
shrouded
sleep
the
dreamless
dark
of
death
euthumism
if
in
the
spirit
glows
no
spark
divine
if
soulless
dust
return
to
dust
again
if
after
life
but
death
and
dark
remain
then
it
were
well
to
make
the
moment
thine
soul
and
sense
in
wine
in
languors
fond
desires
that
heat
the
heart
with
fierce
unhallowed
fires
till
pleasure
transform
us
into
swine
but
if
some
subtler
spirit
thrill
our
clay
some
flame
illume
this
fleeting
dust
promethean
fire
snatched
from
the
olympian
height
then
must
we
choose
the
nobler
higher
way
seeking
the
beautiful
the
pure
the
just
the
ultimate
crowned
triumph
of
the
right
under
the
leaves
the
phalanxes
of
corn
stand
grim
and
serried
dull
gold
the
sodden
sheaves
the
violets
that
smiled
with
spring
are
buried
under
the
leaves
along
the
land
the
winter
doom
is
creeping
all
vainly
autumn
grieves
and
she
who
made
my
heart
sweet
spring
is
sleeping
under
the
leaves
carmen
night

the
twinkle
of

gelid
gems
broidered
with
lace
weft
of
an
elfin
brood
hoar
filagree
to
deck
her
garment
hems
sheer
slanting
down
the
sky
an
opal
light
pierces
the
veil
of
wannish
gray
in
iridescent
sheen
tingeing
the
dazzling
white
with
amethystine
gold
or
beryl

along
the

the

gleam
an

on

till
all
the
waning

incarnadine
glows
like
blown
petals
of
a
shattered
rose
roses
and
rue
i
a
swift
thought
flashed
to
my
mind
that
day
when
i
first
saw
you
regally
tall
a
throng
of
pigmies
a
very
saul
how
some
woman
heart
must
admit
your
sway
some
woman
soul
to
your
soul
be
thrall
and
though
not
for
me
were
the
rapture
to
prove
you
i
thrilled
as
i
thought
how
a
woman
might
love
you
then
strange
that
our
eyes
for
a
moment
should
meet
and
hold
each
other
a
breathless
space
that
a
light
as
of
dawn
should
leap
into
your
face
that
the
lips
that
were
stern
should
an
instant
grow
sweet
ere
you
turned
at
a
word
with
a
courtier
grace
and
i
knew
that
tho
many
a
woman
had
loved
you
till
that
moment
the
glance
of
no
woman
had
moved
you
then
you
stood
at
my
side
and
one
murmured
your
name
the
proud
old
name
that
you
worthily
wore
and
i
drank
the
fate
mandate
upbore
to
my
lips
as
the
fire
of
your
glance
leapt
to
flame
what
need
were
of
words
heart
speaks
heart
evermore
and
i
knew
that
were
mine
but
the
rapture
to
prove
you
how
deeply
how
dearly
one
woman
might
love
you
ii
do
i
idly
dream
as
the
village
maid
who
thinks
as
she
spins
of
a
princekin
gay
on
a
prancing
steed
who
shall
come
her
way
to
woo
her
and
win
her
and
bear
her
away
thro
the
vasty
depths
of
the
forest
shade
to
a
palace
set
in
a
sylvan
glade
to
love
her
for
aye
and
a
day
is
it
like
that
he
with
his
princely
pride
the
son
of
a
proud
old
race
shall
stoop
with
cophetua
kingly
grace
to
lift
me
up
to
the
vacant
place
to
reign
like
a
queen
at
his
side
can
the
world
afford
him
no
worthier
bride
no
bride
with
a
queenlier
grace
aye
a
foolish
dream
for
a
sordid
day
when
men
seek
power
and
women
gold
gone
is
the
chivalrous
age
of
old
when
maids
were
loving
and
men
were
bold
and
good
king
arthur
held
knightly
sway
ah
love
and
knighthood
were
laid
away
with
the
cuirass
and
helm
of
old
but
a
horseman
rides
to
the
wicket
gate
all
my
pulses
proclaim
it
he
my
knight
who
has
parted
the
waves
of
the
sea
who
has
cleft
the
wide
world
in
his
searching
for
me
fond
foolish
dreaming
for
surely
fate
decrees
him
the
winning
a
worthier
mate
than
a
simple
girl
like
me
iii
why
does
he
come
to
me
with
his
deep
impassioned
eyes
stealing
my
soul
from
me
surely
a
high
emprise
for
such
an
one
as
he
to
smile
an
hour
on
me
to
win
a
worthless
prize
would
he
might
let
me
be
proud
am
i
proud
as
he
for
my
name
as
his
is
old
what
should
he
say
to
me
i
have
neither
lands
nor
gold
ah
a
merry
jest
be
to
win
my
heart
from
me
the
tale
will
be
soon
told
would
he
might
let
me
be
iv
swept
swept
away
is
my
vaunted
pride
on
a
of
tenderness
i
envy
the
dog
that
bounds
to
his
side
and
the
chestnut
mare
he
is
wont
to
ride
moor
and
mead
when
the
day
is
fine
as
she
lays
her
head
in
a
mute
caress
the
arm
of
lord
and
ah
silver
and
gold
of
the
glad
june
morning
gold
of
the
sunshine
and
silver
of
dew
dew
drop
gems
all
the
meads
adorning
are
love
and
the
a
theme
for
scorning
roses
roses

not

by
you
antiphonal
to
sweet
sylvan
singers
the
brook
with
its
maddening
gladdening
rune
and
my
lover
kiss
still
thrills
and
lingers
lingers
and
burns
on
my
tremulous
fingers
ah
birds
in
a
very
riot
of
tune
pour
out
my
joy
to
the
heart
of
june
he
loves
me
loves
me
my
heart
is
heart
oh
heart
of
my
heart
is
it
true
song
on
my
lips
from
my
soul
upringing
a
passion
of
bliss
to
the
breezes
flinging
roses
roses
nor
dream
of
rue
i
am
beloved
by
you
vi
to
be
his
wife
calm
all
my
soul
is
filling
a
calm
too
deep
for
smiles
or
even
tears
a
perfect
trust
to
slumber
subtly
stilling
my
whilom
doubts
and
fears
each
little
common
thing
to
me
seems
rarer
my
life
each
day
becomes
more
dear
to
me
love
am
i
fair
ah
fain
would
i
be
fairer
and
yet
more
fair
for
thee
like
to
a
priestess
some
loved
shrine
adorning
i
deck
the
charms
but
poorly
prized
till
late
the
beauty
once
i
held
too
slight
for
scorning
to
thee
now
consecrate
as
if
some
god
of
old
had
stooped
to
love
me
some
star
had
pierced
my
darkness
with
its
ray
i
worship
thee
an
idol
throned
above
me
forgetting
thou
art
clay
rejoicing
in
the
gift
that
god
has
given
i
may
forget
the
giver
love
i
fear
lest
i
shall
forget
to
sigh
for
heaven
when
heaven
for
me
is
here
vii
strange
that
a
love
supreme
should
be
swayed
by
a
petty
pride
as
a
straw
might
turn
aside
the
swift
onflowing
tide
of
a
mighty
seaward
stream
i
know
that
the
fault
was
mine
but
i
can
not
will
not
speak
how
should
i
suppliant
meek
his
gracious
pardon
seek
tho
the
fault
were
mine
all
mine
aye
tho
my
heart
should
break
something
or
pride
or
shame
forbids
me
that
i
should
claim
as
mine
the
fault
the
blame
aye
tho
my
heart
should
break
viii
last
night
he
came
to
me
his
dark
eyes
grave
and
sweet
eyes
that
i
could
not
meet
to
crave
my
pardon
with
that
kingly
courtesy
which
makes
his
least
deed
fine
what
fiend
took
hold
on
me
i
would
nor
speak
nor
heed
tho
he
bent
his
pride
to
plead
he
all
unused
to
sue
though
he
sought
full
tenderly
for
a
pardon
not
due
fool
to
have
played
with
fire
had
i
not
full
often
heard
how
when
his
wrath
was
stirred
it
burst
all
bounds
and
leapt
higher
and
ever
higher
like
flames
by
the
swept
yet
tho
his
face
was
white
with
a
passion
that
shook
his
soul
not
once
did
he
waive
control
tho
his
heart
to
its
depths
was
stirred
he
leashed
his
wrath
that
night
nor
uttered
one
bitter
word
pride
held
me
stubbornly
dumb
stilling
what
words
i
would
say
while
i
flung
my
heart
treasure
away
while
i
tampered
with
fire
to
my
cost
till
i
knew
the
ultimate
end
had
come
i
had
matched
pride
with
love
and
lost
ix
what
poisoned
pen
has
written
the
words
that
bar
my
breath
what
hard
harsh
hand
has
smitten
my
soul
with
death
my
these
the
words
i
read
vision
and
dream
of
a
life
have
died
hurt
to
the
heart
by
the
words
you
said
angered
stung
by
a
wounded
pride
mad
with
the
thought
that
your
love
was
dead
i
have
wedded
a
loveless
unloved
bride
would
i
had
died
instead
my
heart
refuses
to
understand
the
words
that
burn
my
brain
palsied
stunned
by
a
felling
blow
struck
by
a
cherished
hand
i
am
all
too
numb
for
pain
dead
to
a
deathless
woe
helpless
to
understand
shall
i
ever
feel
again
x
awake
alive
to
pain
the
first
steel
gleam
of
morn
stabs
deep
the
heart
i
thought
had
shrunk
to
dust
the
love
i
prayed
might
die
to
loveless
scorn
awakes
and
cries
ah
god
how
is
it
just
a
fault
so
slight
such
meed
of
pain
should
pay
that
one
mad
word
in
pride
and
anger
spoken
should
leave
two
lives
forever
crushed
and
broken
should
plait
a
scourge
to
lash
my
soul
for
aye
how
can
a
just
god
see
men
suffer
thus
unheedful
of
the
cosmic
cry
of
pain
unmoved
by
all
the
pangs
that
torture
us
knowing
our
prayers
and
tears
alike
are
vain
like
to
a
wanton
boy
who
feels
no
thrill
of
pity
for
the
weak
his
strength
holds
thrall
who
pins
a
helpless
butterfly
against
a
wall
watching
the
bright
wings
flutter
and
grow
still
we
are
the
sport
of
some
malignant
power
who
nails
us
to
our
crosses
hard
and
fast
who
sees
us
flutter
for
a
little
hour
struggle
and
suffer
and
grow
still
at
last
who
hears
untouched
the
ceaseless
cosmic
groan
wrung
from
his
creatures
tortured
lips
alway
he
will
not
hear
or
heed
what
need
to
pray
there
is
no
hand
to
help
we
stand
alone
father
forgive
i
know
not
what
i
say
frenzied
tortured
torn
on
the
rack
of
pain
teach
these
lips
once
more
to
pray
help
me
to
trust
again
xi
a
year
how
slight
a
space
when
winged
with
ecstasy
an
æon
dark
to
me
he
has
brought
her
home
god
lend
me
grace
in
the
throng
i
shall
see
his
face
he
has
long
forgotten
me
a
year
i
have
learned
to
smile
i
have
taught
my
eyes
to
lie
i
have
lived
and
laughed
and
sung
the
while
i
have
only
longed
to
die
xii
i
have
seen
him
once
again
there
in
the
throng
with
his
wife
an
eagle
matched
with
a
pitiful
wren
bitter
in
sooth
has
his
portion
been
chained
to
a
clog
for
life
strange
that
our
eyes
as
of
yore
should
meet
and
hold
each
other
a
breathless
space
that
the
of
old
should
illumine
his
face
that
the
lips
that
were
stern
should
an
instant
grow
sweet
touched
with
the
tender
grace
but
his
eyes
were
haggard
and
old
with
pain
traitors
to
thwart
his
resolute
will
they
told
me
the
struggle
was
vain
all
vain
he
loves
me
loves
me
still
xiii
cruel
that
i
should
be
glad
that
he
loves
and
suffers
still
yet
how
should
my
soul
be
sad
that
his
passionate
resolute
will
can
not
crush
the
love
that
is
stronger
than
he
the
love
that
is
all
for
me
the
year
has
left
its
trace
cover
it
how
he
will
on
the
proud
impassive
face
and
i
know
how
he
suffers
still
thrall
to
a
love
that
is
stronger
than
he
a
love
that
is
all
for
me
surely
ah
surely
i
know
i
who
have
known
his
love
i
who
have
loved
him
so
what
such
a
bond
must
prove
linked
to
a
loveless
unloved
wife
chained
to
a
clog
for
life
xiv
she
loves
him
not
they
say
save
for
his
lands
and
gold
she
is
narrow
selfish
cold
stabbing
and
wounding
his
soul
each
day
growing
further
and
further
away
from
the
heart
it
was
hers
to
hold
yet
not
all
blameless
he
a
woman
is
quick
to
feel
what
man
would
fain
conceal
surely
she
can
but
see
that
naught
to
his
life
is
she
nay
nor
can
ever
be
i
am
happier
happier
far
than
he
he
is
meshed
in
a
galling
silken
hold
bound
with
a
jewelled
band
of
gold
while
i
at
least
am
free
and
i
know
what
his
daily
life
must
be
linked
with
a
nature
paltry
slight
he
with
his
generous
kingly
soul
stung
and
goaded
past
all
control
by
a
thousand
petty
barbs
of
venom
and
spite
once
but
once
have
we
met
and
we
spoke
of
trivial
things
of
the
changes
a
twelvemonth
brings
of
late
summer
lingering
yet
ah
how
should
a
heart
that
has
loved
forget
traitors
ever
to
thwart
his
will
his
eyes
confirm
what
i
half
divine
a
bitter
bootless
victory
mine
he
can
not
choose
but
to
love
me
still
xv
whose
was
the
fault
the
blame
she
has
fled
and
left
him
free
free
but
a
stain
of
shame
rests
on
the
proud
old
name
at
a
bitter
cost
she
has
set
him
free
free
with
a
blemished
fame
and
he
with
the
pride
of
his
race
with
a
resolute
calm
control
locks
in
his
heart
the
heart
disgrace
shows
of
his
shame
no
subtlest
trace
hiding
the
hurt
of
a
stricken
soul
the
calm
of
a
passionless
face
he
had
deemed
it
a
cowardly
thing
to
fly
while
the
village
prated
anent
his
shame
and
an
added
blot
on
his
noble
name
by
his
own
hand
to
die
but
oft
in
the
deep
of
night
i
hear
borne
on
the
wild
night
wind
the
beat
of
the
mare
hoofs
thundering
past
and
my
heart
is
clutched
by
an
icy
fear
of
a
direful
thing
that
may
chance
at
last
for
ride
he
never
so
far
so
fast
black
care
rides
hard
behind
xvi
last
night
as
i
stood
in
the
gloaming
gray
ere
the
moon
came
into
the
sky
he
came
to
me
for
a
last
at
last
he
is
going
away
his
face
in
the
dusk
showed
stern
and
set
old
and
haggard
and
worn
with
pain
dear
i
may
never
see
you
again
mine
but
the
meed
regret
how
can
i
ask
you
to
share
my
shame
how
can
i
give
you
my
blemished
name
yet
how
shall
the
heart
forget
naught
in
my
life
save
a
dream
have
i
a
dream
a
vision
too
fair
to
be
a
rose
that
blooms
the
rue
for
me
naught
but
a
dream
and
then
ere
he
lifted
his
bridle
rein
to
ride
away
down
the
land
he
bent
and
touched
with
his
lips
the
hand
i
had
laid
on
the
chestnut
mane
xvii
something
my
senses
will
scarce
recall
the
horror
they
came
in
the
night
to
tell
the
mare
had
galloped
riderless
home
blown
and
bleeding
and
flecked
with
foam
and
they
found
him
there
by
the
sunken
wall
hurt
to
the
death
by
the
desperate
fall
how
it
had
chanced
he
could
only
tell
ere
the
merciful
numbness
stole
his
brain
how
the
chestnut
rose
to
the
leap
and
fell
then
his
senses
closed
on
the
shocks
of
pain
he
spoke
they
told
me
but
once
again
to
whisper
my
name
with
his
struggling
breath
thank
god
he
suffered
so
brief
a
while
then
peacefully
sank
on
the
breast
of
death
dead
with
his
lips
asmile
how
can
i
wish
him
alive
again
lying
so
peacefully
placidly
still
with
that
carven
smile
on
his
marble
face
how
can
i
pray
that
his
heart
should
thrill
to
waking
and
waking
pain
lying
so
peacefully
placidly
still
with
the
old
sweet
smile
on
his
quiet
face
dead
to
the
sting
of
a
heart
disgrace
how
should
i
wish
him
a
lesser
grace
how
should
i
strive
with
a
wiser
will
yet
how
can
the
heart
that
is
reft
divine
death
mystical
measureless
charity
the
cry
of
the
stricken
king
is
mine
would
i
had
died
for
thee
severance
not
severed
by
long
leagues
of
lonely
land
nor
sundered
by
wide
wastes
of
sounding
sea
but
ever
side
by
side
and
hand
in
hand
and
yet
apart
are
we
spartacus
he
stands
imperial
chief
of
all
rome
gladiators
brave
beyond
all
others
fearless
in
belief
a
captive
but
no
slave
his
brow
is
like
a
god
a
brow
of
power
lips
soft
with
human
sweetness
ere
the
day
he
entered
the
arena
and
the
hour
he
first
beheld
man
mixed
with
clay
felt
rise
within
him
bestial
strange
desires
and
savage
instincts
in
a
brutal
heart
that
battened
on
men
blood
burned
with
unhallowed
fires
of
slaughter
till
a
thing
apart
a
hired
butcher
of
his
fellow
men
he
stands
daring
the
fasting
lion
in
his
den
or
some
fierce
gladiator
on
the
sands
a
savage

in

that
from

into

glad
and
sweet
lifts
to
far
sapphire
skies
its
radiant
head
unheedful
of
the

at

feet
yet
should
one
loving
reverently
kneel
and
draw
the
lily

apart
perchance
those
waxen
petals
might
reveal
enshrined
within
a
glowing
golden
heart
loveless
as
some
poor
starveling
at
a
palace
gate
sees
curtained
gleams
from
halls
hears
song
from
the
festal
walls
scents
viands
that
shall
princely
palates
sate
yet
in
the
outer
gloom
may
only
wait
crouched
in
the
cold
for
some

mean
morsel
flung
him
from

plenteous
feast
poor

to
the

transmute

may
not
enter
in

i

then
void
of

and
starved
of

sadly
turn
away
clytie
the

to

lands
under

her

palace
stands

corals
and

swept
from

strewing

strands
starring

in

lands
under

thro

under

where
the

girding
their

clad
in

veiled
in

bright
locks
sheen
where
the
dim
seaweeds
sway
trackless
her
white
feet
stray
all
thro
the
dreamy
day
under
the
sea
or
like
a
star
she
glides
over
the

deftly
her

she

alive
they
seem
softly
the

swell
rocking
the

shell
where
the
rides
wafture
of

swift
as
a
star
she
glides
over
the

one
day
she
lifts
her

up
from
the

where
the
great
flies
over
the

afar
guiding
his
golden
car
all
his
star
brow
aglow
all
his
bright
hair
aflow
dawn
in
his

lies

at
his

hapless
she
lifts
her

up
from
the

swiftly
his
steeds
speed
on
over
the
sea
soon
is
the
splendor
flown
lone
on
the
shore
she
stands
stretching
imploring
hands
lifting
impassioned
eyes
where
the
last
dies
all
the
day
brightness
gone
hapless
she
stands
alone
heedless
the
god
speeds
on
over
the
sea
ever
her
wistful
gaze
over
the
sea
yearns
on
the
rays
till
by
some
subtle
power
changed
to
a
golden
flower
still
in
her
robe
of
green
crowned
with
her
gold
hair
sheen
slight
on
her
stem
she
sways
yet
does
her
yearning
gaze
follow
the
rays
over
the
sea
in
bondage
what
can
it
profit
a
man
tho
he
have
the
soul
of
a
god
sunk
in
the
form
of
a
beast
with
a
senseless
simian
face
what
can
the
world
perceive
of
the
subtler
inward
grace
breathing
upon
the
dust
of
the
coarse
clay
clod
what
knows
the
world
of
me
the
me
that
is
prisoned
within
seeing
only
the
self
that
sickens
its
sensitive
eyes
how
can
it
know
that
this
hateful
mask
hides
not
the
sneer
of
sin
that
this
cloak
of
crass
crude
flesh
is
a
trusty
soul
disguise
what
can
i
hope
to
win
which
of
the
gifts
men
prize
what
can
i
have
or
hold
of
the
bounteous
boon
i
crave
i
with
the
coarse
stubbed
hands
the
dull
and
narrow
eyes
the
leer
of
the
brutal
slave
what
can
i
know
of
love
i
with
my
face
frighting
the
tender
trust
of
the
timorous
shrinking
maid
who
drawn
by
my
deep
soul
spell
to
the
soul
embrace
then
looks
on
its
hideous
mask
and
trembles
and
flees
dismayed
yet
must
the
soul
of
fire
chained
to
this
cursed
clay
galled
by
its
fetters
of
flesh
seared
with
a
thousand
scars
shriek
and
struggle
and
beat
its
breast
on
its
prison
bars
thro
the
night
long
dark
of
despair
till
the
dawning
of
ultimate
day
till
the
glow
of
that
ultimate
dawn
transfigure
the
tortured
face
and
the
sacred
fire
within
crumble
the
coarse
clay
clod
till
the
soul
breathed
on
by
an
unseen
unknown
grace
stripped
of
its
bonds
of
flesh
stand
face
to
face
with
its
god
to
a
singer
beneath
thy
midas
touch
life
sullen
grays
are
thrilled
to
sudden
gold
as
some
far
gleam
from
wings
of
helios
athwart
thy
dream
irradiates
for
thee
earth
darksome
ways
wild
woodland
voices
ripple
thro
thy

sweet

murmurs
from
some
spring
brook

the

call
the
calm
of

a
glint
of

on
the

the
drowsy
drone
of
bee
made
drunk
with
draughts
of
purple
wine
all
these

music
holds
for
thee
and
all
thy
days
and

companioning
walks
nature
with
her
hand
in
thine
blossom
of
brine
morn
and
a
white
sail
winging
over
the
sunlit
waves
a
song
on
the
breezes
ringing
up
from
the
coral
caves
where
white
arms
lifting
wreaths
for
the
twine
of
the
frail
drifting
on
the
blossom
of
brine
night
and
a
dark
rack
flying
over
the
sullen
waves
a
dirge
on
the
night
winds
sighing
up
from
the
cold
sea
caves
where
white
arms
lifting
wreaths
for
a
pall
entwine
for
a
still
white
face
is
drifting
on
the
blossom
of
brine
a
memory
strange
that
across
the
vast
of
varied
years
fraught
with
life
wonted
alloy
mingled
joy
and
pain
with
smiles
or
gloomed
with
mists
of
tears
old
memories
should
wake
to
life
again
old
thoughts
and
dreams
words
breathed
by
lips
long
dumb
songs
sung
by
voices
silent
now
for
aye
like
hosts
of
speechless
spectres
thronging
come
dim
formless
wraiths
of
each
dear
vanished
day
strange
that
a
fragment
of
a
life
replete
a
few
brief
hours
as
men
measure
time
a
chapter
in
life
book
closed
now
yet
vaguely
sweet
as
zephyrs
from
some
clime
should
drift
across
my
heart
while
joysome
memories
rise
of
golden
moments
snatched
from
arcady
of
silver
sails
and
skies
of
viridescent
earth
and
sapphire
sea
of
where
pleasure
dreamful
lies
of
kindred
souls
responsive
each
to
each
of
thoughts
half
hidden
by
eyes
sweet
traitors
telling
that
denied
to
speech
the
merest
fragment
of
a
life
replete
a
existence
sombre
grays
eyes
hands
and
hearts
that
for

meet
in

thee
through

save
for
the
wanton
care
who
flouts
him
mocks
his
grief
with
gibes
and
jeers
and
laughs
to
see
his
piteous
hopes
grow
fears
not
his
the
joy
of
placid
age
his
dim
eyes
falter
as
he
scans
the
page
of
life
worn
album
blotted
with
his
tears
he
sees
in
dreams
the
wife
he
loved
long
dead
the
son
once
proud
to
bear
his
father
name
who
mixed
his
honest
blood
with
dire
disgrace
the
wayward
girl
who
wrought
her
father
shame
he
sits
alone
with
care
the
day
has
fled
and
twilight
falls
upon
the
furrowed
face
fate
thro
countless
æons
sunless
and
remote
a
soul
went
searching
for
its
spirit
mate
thro
space
deep
afloat
forever
desolate
anon
another
spirit
lone
of
heart
goes
forth
thro
voiceless
void
to
seek
its
mate
eftsoon
they
meet
these
twain
strike
hands
and
part
and
this
is
fate
the
path
of
dreams
beside
the
stream
that
silverly
steals
on
to
swell
the
song
of
that
sea
which
breaks
upon
the
utmost
shore
of
thought
they
who
have
drunk
at
song
immortal
spring
walk
with
glad
feet
the
upland
path
of
dreams
that
whitely
winds
thro
long
lands
by
one
yclept
the
way
of
fools
a
plain
of
dust
and
ashes
and
of
dead
sea
fruit
but
by
another
called
the
path
of
hope
that
leads
far
up
the
slope
of
heart
desire
and
haply
both
speak
truth
for
oft
the
way
is
set
with
stones
that
tear
the
climbing
feet
and
oft
for
roses
there
is
bitter
rue
and
oft
for
singing
there
is
idle
scorn
and
sneers
full
oft
for
smiles
yet
well
we
know
the
upland
path
of
dreams
that
whitely
winds
yclept
or
way
of
fools
or
path
of
hope
leads
upward
ever
to
the
hills
of
song
beside
the
silent
stream
whose
soundless
tide
sets
ever
to
the
unknown
tideless
sea
they
who
have
drunk
of
slumber
poppied
draught
walk
with
unsandalled
feet
the
path
of
dreams
that
winds
thro
gray
fields
of
sleep
to
dim
dream
shores
girt
with
dim
swayed
ever
by
the
sweep
of
unseen
wings
palms
and
arabesques
of
ferns
and
fields
of
sombre
bloom
and
scentless
flowers
not
of
their
wonted
hue
but
dimly
gray
where
songless
birds
like
shades
of
shadows
flit
and
silent
winds
from
poppied
meadows
blow
and
here
dear
presences
to
us
denied
by
sterner
day
approach
to
cry
us
hail
and
here
a
little
do
we
taste
the
joy
of
kisses
dreamed
on
lips
forever
mute
a
little
know
the
bliss
of
hope
fulfilled
and
dreams
that
seem
as
true
as
very
truth
yet
well
we
know
that
with
the
stir
of
dawn
waking
we
must
return
from
sleep
far
fields
beside
the
lethean
stream
whose
soundless
tide
sets
ever
to
the
unknown
tideless
sea
that
breaks
upon
the
farthest
unknown
shore
they
who
have
quaffed
dark
asrael
mystic
draught
walk
with
still
feet
the
viewless
path
of
dreams
that
winds
thro
long
fields
of
sleep
to
fields
elysian
or
tartarian
glooms
and
haply
presences
denied
by
sterner
life
shall
come
to
cry
us
hail
bright
radiances
from
realms
of
light
eterne
or
shadows
from
the
shades
of
awful
dis
but
whether
here
we
taste
of
hope
fulfilled
or
find
our
dreams
are
but
as
drifted
dust
from
dark
of
dis
or
realms
of
light
eterne
full
well
we
know
we
shall
return
no
more
an
autumn
song
the
dim
sun
slips
adown
the
sky
that
dies
from
gold
to
gray
the
homing
birds
that
southward
fly
to
my
heart
hailing
make
reply
piping
southward
i
turn
my
wistful
eyes
southward
where
all
my
treasure
lies
whither
the
homing
sparrow
flies
piping
the
chill
blast
sweeps
the
steely
sky
that
glooms
a
sullen
gray
soft
summer
winds
that
southward
fly
to
my
soul
sighing
make
reply
breathing
southward
i
turn
my
longing
eyes
southward
my
yearning
spirit
hies
whither
or
bird
or
zephyr
flies
sighing
vain
wreath
of
laurel
and
crown
of
bay
and
the
noisy
trump
of
fame
praise
for
the
singer
deathless
lay
and
a
listening
world
acclaim
but
the
singer
sits
with
his
grief
alone
where
love
lies
cold
and
dead
the
plaudits
fall
on
a
heart
of
stone
the
soul
of
the
song
has
fled
sartor
resartus
ah
god
be
merciful
to
him
who
sees
thro
ermined
pomp
and
pageantry
of
kings
thro
regal
mien
and
beauty
witcheries
the
poor
weak
shrivelled
soul
that
crouches
hid
within
the
body
hold
is
he
whose
soul
sees
souls
of
others
face
to
face
who
strips
the
outer
man
like
vestments
off
and
views
the
naked
heart
in
all
its
shame
and
poverty
who
still
must
rend
the
veil
of
motive
purpose
false
humanity
and
futile
pretense
god
to
walk
this
world
doomed
still
to
see
what
others
fain
would
hide
reading
men
thoughts
as
scholars
read
the
page
of
some
old
language
dead
to
all
save
them
seeing
beneath
the
tender
woman
flesh
the
the
pleading
the
grisly
skeleton
the
hollow
ribs
the
eyeless
sockets
and
the
grinning
jaw
reading
for
aye
the
sneer
beneath
the
smile
the
lie
that
lurks
behind
the
seeming
truth
to
know
that
such
or
haply
worse
am
i
a
living
lie
false
prophet
to
myself
clothed
on
with
shimmering
robes
of
fallacy
and
vain
deceit
ah
god
where
is
the
truth
are
all
men
false
or
lies
the
fault
in
me
who
seize
only
on
the
taint
and
leave
the
pure
if
haply
thus
it
be
in
pity
take
away
the
subtle
sight
that
pierces
thought
give
back
the
old
fond
faith
the
young
belief
in
all
humanity
hide
from
my
view
the
canker
in
the
rose
the
taint
in
truth
the
blight
upon
the
bloom
far
better
to
drink
the
hemlock
draught
and
happy
deem
it
nectar
than
to
find
the
drop
of
gall
within
the
nectared
cup
far
better
trust
repaid
with
treachery
than
doubt
confirmed
ah
thou
god
who
art
the
truth
make
me
to
see
the
truth
lift
from
my
soul
the
shadow
in
the
room
of
doubt
send
trust
let
me
believe
again
help
me
to
see
the
highest
in
mankind
illumed
like
to
a
little
child
whose
straying
feet
tracking
the
guiling
glint
and
gleam
have
wandered
far
afield
by
marsh
and
stream
while
just
before
the
wavering
glimmers
fleet
on
and
still
on
where
sky
and
meadow
meet
till
spent
and
fearful
in
the
gathering
gloom
at
last
he
sees
the
guiding
light
of
home
where
love
awaits
and
sweet
so
was
it
mine
through
fens
of
doubt
to
stray
pursuing
still
some
fair
ephemeron
or
fleeting
gleam
or
shimmering
fallacy
till
through
the
deepening
dusk
a
beacon
shone
set
by
the
hand
of
love
to
light
the
way
o
father
to
implicit
trust
in
thee
in
the
play
in
a
painted
forest
of
arden
in
the
glare
of
the
garish
light
in
doublet
and
hose
and
rouged
you
sigh
to
me
night
by
night
attuned
to
the
sway
of
your
cadenced
voice
as
a
harp
to
the
wooing
wind
i
thrill
at
the
touch
of
your
painted
lips
for
am
your
rosalind
could
you
know
that
my
art
in
seeming
was
a
dearer
thing
than
art
that
the
spoken
nightly
spring
straight
from
a
loving
heart
could
you
know
that
my
soul
speaks
to
you
aye
soul
and
spirit
and
mind
when
i
gaze
deep
into
your
eyes
and
breathe
i
am
your
rosalind
to
you
is
a
vain
dissembling
a
part
of
the
work
of
the
day
and
the
words
that
your
voice
makes
music
but
the
dull
dead
lines
of
the
play
little
you
care
for
the
woman
you
woo
save
as
a
foil
designed
to
prove
your
skill
as
a
lover
yet
am
your
rosalind
i
merge
in
the
player
the
woman
the
actress
good
at
her
art
must
needs
look
well
to
each
glance
and
tone
must
needs
play
still
her
part
tho
the

that
must
else
be

aye
soul
and

cry
to
your
soul
in

i

to
b
imperial
as
that
famed
elizabeth
before
whose
feet
a
knight
his
cloak
cast
down
a

altho
thine
only
crown
love
roses
for
thee
elizabeth
ah
maiden
sweeter
than
morn
nectared
breath
across
thy
path
no
regal
robe
i
fling
only
a
living
loving
heart
i
bring
to
lay
at
thy
dear
feet
elizabeth
through
the
dark
last
night
they
laid
me
in
my
winding
sheet
set
burning
tapers
at
my
feet
and
head
decked
me
with
wan
white
blossoms
faint
and
sweet
and
told
each
other
softly
she
is
dead
ay
dumb
and
dead
enshrouded
cold
and
stark
i
lay
where
waned
the
tawny
tapers
dim
pulseless
and
pale
yet
thro
the
dreadful
dark
i
lived
in
thoughts
of
the
morning
came
one
who
had
loved
me
bent
above
my
face
with
tears
and
bated
breath
laid
on
my
heart
the
roses
had
sent
and
i
was
glad
of
death
preluding
frail
fronds
of
ferns
uncurling
blue
iris
flags
unfurling
pale
showers
of
blossoms
swirling
like
clouds
of
snow
with
fragile
wildings
playing
like
two
blithe
children
maying
across
the
glad
meads
straying
together
dear
we
go
the
silver
clouds
vague
lights
and
shadows
shifting
the
sungleams
sifting
down
thro
the
latticed
leaves
gray
brooks
the
meadows
lacing
young
the
uplands
gracing
her
faery
tracing
the
skillful
spider
weaves
from
long
long
shaken
the
vivid
violets
waken
his
southern
haunts
forsaken
the
bluebird
flecks
the
sky
ah
breath
of
heather
ah
golden
maytime
weather
we
drift
in
dreams
together
together
you
and
i
the
heights
of
silence
transcribed
from
the
choir
invisible
above
the
valleys
peopled
fair
and
warm
rise
the
bleak
silent
uplands
where
abide
wraiths
of
lost
loves
love
recompense
denied
unspoken
unconfessed
unsatisfied
cold
silent
heights
engirt
with
zones
of
storm
where
love
for
aye
unmated
must
abide
the
broad
sweet
downward
vistas
of
the
flesh
stretch
fair
and
far
the
calm
white
is
lone
and
chill
there
dimly
shines
the
light
of
sun
and
star
that
burns
and
beacons
bright
where
sin
spreads
still
her
guiling
mesh
ah
warm
the
valley
lone
and
chill
the
height
yet
he
who
wins
the
height
sublimity
the
silent
height
where
loves
unlived
abide
loves
stainless
sublimated
purified
shall
glimpse
that
land
to
grosser
view
denied
where
love
and
longing
infinite
shall
be
or
ever
stilled
or
ever
satisfied
andromeda
bound
ever
to
a
great
grey
rock
of
doom
striving
with
futile
hands
to
rive
the
chain
of
woven
fear
distrust
and
subtle
pain
while
gaunt
that
leap
from
out
the
gloom
of
doubt
cold
sea
are
snarling
at
my
feet
as
nearer
writhes
the
dragon
of
despair
foul
with
dank
horrors
of
his
caverned
lair
and
like
a
clock
of
doom
the
dark
tides
beat
i
lift
my
eyes
lo
sudden
sweeps
along
thought
empyrean
and
the
vast
of
dreams
one
meseems
his
feet
are
winged
with
music
shod
with
song
ah
perseus
thou
pitying
leave
the
sky
to
loose
my
bonds
then
all
the
fear
were
gone
soul
touching
soul
trust
from
distrust
were
won
like
god
and
goddess
thou
and
i
despair
were
slain
closed
the
unequal
strife
thy
great
soul
strength
should
make
weak
purpose
strong
thy
hand
should
lead
me
up
the
slopes
of
song
thy
winged
feet
guide
me
to
the
peaks
of
life
requital
what
tho
you
loved
me
once
man
love
at
best
is
but
a
mood
the
fancy
of
an
hour
you
held
all
faith
and
truth
a
theme
for
jest
love
recompense
a
smile
you
knew
your
power
what
tho
you
loved
me
then
you
went
away
and
left
my
life
an
arid
waste
of
pain
and
now
your
best
years
spent
your
idols
clay
you
stretch
imploring
arms
to
me
again
what
tho
you
love
me
still
what
tho
you
say
the
current
of
your
life
toward
mine
is
set
as
vagrant
stars
obey
the
planets
sway
or
perfume
clingeth
to
the
violet
what
tho
i
once
loved
you
see
in
yon
west
day
fires
have
burned
to
ashes
cold
and
gray
so
in
my
quiet
heart
love
wild
unrest
by
its
own
flame
consumed
is
dead
for
aye
when
fades
the
light
when
fades
the
light
along
the
western
sky
when
dies
the
last
dim
rose
to
subtlest
gray
when
darkling
mere
and
mead
enshadowed
lie
and
night
wide
arms
enfold
the
wearied
day
when
tired
lilies
ring
their
vesper
bells
and
dusking
leaves
speak
whispered
orison
when
cassocked
twilight
breathing
benison
his
rosary
of
flashing
fireflies
tells
then
ends
the
struggle
strong
no
more
i
drift
far
out
on
fancy
phantom
sea
setting
full
sail
for
that
forbidden
shore
where
waiteth
love
for
me
when
fades
the
light
from
out
my
dying
eyes
and
soul
and
sense
seem
slipping
soft
away
when
death
swift
shallop
launched
on
lethe
lies
waiting
to
wing
me
to
the
unknown
gray
when
things
of
time
and
thought
grow
strangely
dim
and
the
pent
spirit
strains
to
loose
its
bands
till
from
the
fettered
feet
and
helpless
hands
shall
fall
life
shackles
pitiless
and
grim
then
shall
the
conflict
cease
enchained
no
more
my
soul
shall
sail
the
silent
unknown
sea
until
it
touch
the
unforbidden
shore
where
love
awaiteth
me
butterflies
as
if
a
bed
of
bloom
had
taken
wing
bright
marigolds
nasturtiums
zinnias
gay
they
breast
the
breeze
or
lightly
poising
cling
to
other
flowers
not
animate
as
they
in
the
dark
forest
the
long
gray
twilight
falls
and
deeper
glooms
close
round
the
graying
wood
that
dimmer
grows
as
dies
the
day
last
yearning
tint
of
rose
and
dusk
spins
shadows
on
her
eldritch
looms
the
black
bat
flits
the
eerie
white
moth
flies
wan
ghost
of
yesterday
bright
butterfly
the
dusking
forest
pools
uplooking
lie
like
graveless
dead
men
staring
sightless
eyes
ah
eerie
eerie
is
the
lonely
wood
but
lo
the
faeries
light
their
firefly
lamps
elusive
foxfire
flames
from
marish
damps
hastes
to
the
an
elfin
brood
a
far
bell
chimes
the
cricket
cheerly
shrills
the
droning
beetle
sounds
his
hoarse
bassoon
and
hylas
trill
eftsoon
the
rising
moon
the
ambient
air
to
molten
silver
thrills
then
all
the
lyric
night
is
set
to
song
the
cuckoo
calls
the
plaining
whippoorwill
cries
faint
and
far
away
more
distant
still
the
hoopoe
hid
his
marshy
haunts
among
wails
with
the
cry
of
some
lost
soul
in
pain
the
nightingale
engilds
the
pulsant
dark
with
melody
but
hark
the
discord
mars
the
perfect
strain
the
night
wears
on
black
shadows
throng
apace
the
wood
is
still
the
moon
grows
wan
and
old
white
wreathe
like
clammy
arms
and
like
dead
fingers
sweep
my
face
the
bittern
wailing
leaves
the
sombre
pool
voicing
the
pain
that
never
dies
the
owl
with
ghoulish
laughter
outward
flies
like
some
weird
vivien
shrieking
fool
and
fool
insatiate
what
though
she
lieth
mute
on
yonder
hill
though
ivy
green
and
shadowy
eglatere
have
held
in
tender
fold
through
many
a
year
her
quiet
grave

still
he
loved
her
once
ay
though
he
hold
me
fast
and
sear
my
lips
with
kisses
no
touch
of
mine
can
make
his
life
replete
for
man
first
love
is
oftentimes
his
last
a
still
face
glimmers
through
my
dreams
for
aye
when
i
strain
him
close
with
feverish
grasp
wan
fingers
loose
the
clinging

and

my
fervid

she

incarnate
in
each
flower

the
violets
in
my
hand
the
that
lights
the
autumn
land
seems
but
the
scattered
of
her
hair
love
perfect
flower
may
never
bloom
for
me
for
me
his
