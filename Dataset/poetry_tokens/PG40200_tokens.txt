vidal
the
fool
par
excellence
of
all
provence
of
whom
the
tale
tells
how
he
ran
mad
as
a
wolf
because
of
his
love
for
loba
of
penautier
and
how
men
hunted
him
with
dogs
through
the
mountains
of
cabaret
and
brought
him
for
dead
to
the
dwelling
of
this
loba
of
penautier
and
how
she
and
her
lord
had
him
healed
and
made
welcome
and
he
stayed
some
time
at
that
court
he
speaks
when
i
but
think
upon
the
great
dead
days
and
turn
my
mind
upon
that
splendid
madness
lo
i
do
curse
my
strength
and
blame
the
sun
his
gladness
for
that
the
one
is
dead
and
the
red
sun
mocks
my
sadness
behold
me
vidal
that
was
fool
of
fools
swift
as
the
king
wolf
was
i
and
as
strong
when
tall
stags
fled
me
through
the
alder
brakes
and
every
jongleur
knew
me
in
his
song
and
the
hounds
fled
and
the
deer
fled
and
none
fled
over
long
even
the
grey
pack
knew
me
and
knew
fear
god
how
the
swiftest
hind
blood
spurted
hot
over
the
sharpened
teeth
and
purpling
lips
hot
was
that
hind
blood
yet
it
scorched
me
not
as
did
first
scorn
then
lips
of
the
penautier
aye
ye
are
fools
if
ye
think
time
can
blot
from
piere
vidal
remembrance
that
blue
night
god
but
the
purple
of
the
sky
was
deep
clear
deep
translucent
so
the
stars
me
seemed
set
deep
in
crystal
and
because
my
sleep
rare
visitor
came
not
the
saints
i
guerdon
for
that
restlessness
piere
set
to
keep
one
more
fool
vigil
with
the
hollyhocks
swift
came
the
loba
as
a
branch
that
caught
tom
green
and
silent
in
the
swollen
rhone
green
was
her
mantle
close
and
wrought
of
some
thin
silk
stuff
that
scarce
stuff
at
all
but
like
a
mist
wherethrough
her
white
form
fought
and
conquered
ah
god
conquered
silent
my
mate
came
as
the
night
was
still
speech
words
faugh
who
talks
of
words
and
love
hot
is
such
love
and
silent
silent
as
fate
is
and
as
strong
until
it
faints
in
taking
and
in
giving
all
stark
keen
triumphant
till
it
plays
at
death
god
she
was
white
then
splendid
as
some
tomb
high
wrought
of
marble
and
the
panting
breath
ceased
utterly
well
then
i
waited
drew
then
naked
from
its
saffron
sheath
drew
full
this
dagger
that
doth
tremble
here
just
then
she
woke
and
mocked
the
less
keen
blade
ah
god
the
loba
and
my
only
mate
was
there
such
flesh
made
ever
and
unmade
god
curse
the
years
that
turn
such
women
grey
behold
here
vidal
that
was
hunted
flayed
shamed
and
yet
bowed
not
and
that
won
at
last
and
yet
i
curse
the
sun
for
his
red
gladness
i
that
have
known
strath
garth
brake
dale
and
every
of
the
wood
through
that
great
madness
behold
me
shrivelled
as
an
old
oak
trunk
and
made
men
in
my
rotten
sadness
no
man
hath
heard
the
glory
of
my
days
no
man
hath
dared
and
won
his
dare
as
i
one
night
one
body
and
one
welding
flame
what
do
ye

ye
niggards

buy
such
glory
of

they
whined
as
he
walked
out
calm
between
wi
his
eyes
like
the
grey
o
the
sea
like
the
sea
that
brooks
no
voyaging
with

unleashed
and

footnote
fere
mate
companion
the
publisher
desires
to
state
that
the
ballad
of
the
goodly
fere
by
the
wish
of
the
author
is
reproduced
exactly
as
it
appeared
in
the
english
review
hymn
iii
from
the
latin
of
marc
antony
flaminius
sixteenth
century
as
a
fragile
and
lovely
flower
unfolds
its
gleaming
foliage
on
the
breast
of
the
fostering
earth
if
the
dew
and
the
rain
draw
it
forth
so
doth
my
tender
mind
flourish
if
it
be
fed
with
the
sweet
dew
of
the
fostering
spirit
lacking
this
it
beginneth
straightway
to
languish
even
as
a
floweret
born
upon
dry
earth
if
the
dew
and
the
rain
tend
it
not
sestina
for
ysolt
there
comes
upon
me
will
to
speak
in
praise
of
things
most
fragile
in
their
loveliness
because
the
sky
hath
wept
all
this
long
day
and
wrapped
men
hearts
within
its
cloak
of
greyness
because
they
look
not
down
i
sing
the
stars
because
is
still
i
praise
may
flowers
also
i
praise
long
hands
that
lie
as
flowers
which
though
they
labour
not
are
worthy
praise
and
praise
deep
eyes
like
pools
wherein
the
stars
gleam
out
reflected
in
their
loveliness
for
whoso
look
on
such
there
is
no
greyness
may
hang
about
his
heart
on
any
day
the
other
things
that
i
would
praise
besides
white
hands
and
all
the
fragile
flowers
and
by
their
praise
dispel
the
evening
greyness
i
praise
dim
hair
that
worthiest
is
of
praise
and
dream
upon
its
unbound
loveliness
and
how
therethrough
mine
eyes
have
seen
the
stars
yea
through
that
cloud
mine
eyes
have
seen
the
stars
that
drift
out
slowly
when
night
steals
the
day
through
such
a
cloud
meseems
their
loveliness
surpasses
that
of
all
the
other
flowers
for
that
one
night
i
give
all
nights
my
praise
and
love
therefrom
the
twilight
coming
greyness
there
is
a
stillness
in
this
twilight
greyness
although
the
rain
hath
veiled
the
stars
they
seem
to
listen
as
i
weave
this
praise
of
what
i
have
not
seen
all
this
grey
day
and
they
will
tell
my
praise
unto
the
flowers
when
may
shall
bid
them
in
in
loveliness
o
ye
i
love
who
hold
this
loveliness
near
to
your
hearts
may
never
any
greyness
enshroud
your
hearts
when
ye
would
gather
flowers
or
bind
your
eyes
when
ye
would
see
the
stars
but
alway
do
i
give
ye
flowers
by
day
and
when
day
plucked
i
give
ye
stars
for
praise
but
most
thou
flower
whose
eyes
are
like
the
stars
with
whom
my
dreams
bide
all
the
day
within
thy
hands
would
i
rest
all
my
praise
portrait
from
la
mère
inconnue
now
would
i
weave
her
portrait
out
of
all
dim
splendour
of
provence

is
in

shadow
there
just
by
two
stars

the

cloud
of

can
reach
to
her
as

the

of
some

heard
just
beyond

she
all

new
book
of
poems
for
years
past
has
had
such
a
freshness
of
inspiration
such
a
strongly
individual
note
or
been
more
alive
with
undoubtable
promise
daily
all
his
poems
are
like
this
from
beginning
to
end
and
in
every
way
his
own
and
in
a
world
of
his
own
for
brusque
intensity
of
effect
we
can
hardly
compare
them
to
any
other
work
it
is
the
old
miracle
that
can
not
be
defined
nothing
more
than
a
subtle
entanglement
of
words
so
that
they
rise
out
of
their
graves
and
sing
from
a
page
detailed
critique
by
edward
thomas
in
english
he
has
hardly
any
of
the
superficial
good
qualities
of
modern
versifiers
he
has
not
the
current
melancholy
or
resignation
or
unwillingness
to
live
nor
the
kind
of
feeling
for
nature
that
runs
to
minute
description
and
decorative
metaphor
he
can
not
be
usefully
compared
with
any
living
writers
full
of
personality
and
with
such
power
to
express
it
that
from
the
first
to
the
last
lines
of
most
of
his
poems
he
holds
us
steadily
in
his
own
pure
grave
passionate
world
the
beauty
of
it
praise
of
ysolt
is
the
beauty
of
passion
sincerity
and
intensity
not
of
beautiful
words
and
images
and
suggestions
the
thought
dominates
the
words
and
is
greater
than
they
are
here
for
glaucus
the
effect
is
full
of
human
passion
and
natural
magic
without
any
of
the
phrases
which
a
reader
of
modern
verse
would
expect
in
the
treatment
of
such
a
subject
this
admirable
poet
oxford
this
is
a
most
exciting
book
of
poems
evening
a
queer
little
book
which
will
irritate
many
readers
morning
ezra
pound
immediately
compels
our
admiration
by
his
fearlessness
and
lack
of
oxford
this
book
has
about
it
the
breath
of
the
open
air
physically
and
intellectually
the
verse
seems
to
reproduce
the
personality
with
a
brief
fulness
and
adequacy
it
is
only
in
flexible
lithe
measures
such
as
those
which
coventry
patmore
chose
in
his
eros
and
mr
pound
chooses
here
that
a
fully
suitable
form
for
the
recital
of
spiritual
experience
is
to
be
found
mr
pound
has
a
true
and
invariable
feeling
for
the
measures
he
employs
this
wonderful
little
book
daily
a
poet
with
individuality
thread
of
true
beauty
lifts
it
out
of
the
ruck
of
those
many
volumes
the
writers
or
which
toe
the
line
of
poetic
convention
and
please
for
no
more
than
a
single
reading
concerning
a
certain
ezekiel
ton
by
far
the
newest
poet
going
whatever
other
advertisements
may
say
and
announced
as
the
most
remarkable
thing
in
poetry
since
robert
browning
says
he
has
succeeded
where
all
others
have
failed
in
evolving
a
blend
of
the
imagery
of
the
unfettered
west
the
vocabulary
of
wardour
street
and
the
sinister
abandon
of
borgaic
italy
in
daily
at
first
the
whole
thing
may
seem
to
be
mere
madness
and
rhetoric
a
vain
exhibition
of
force
and
passion
without
beauty
but
as
we
read
on
these
curious
metres
of
his
seem
to
have
a
law
and
order
of
their
own
the
brute
force
of
mr
pound
imagination
seems
to
impart
some
quality
of
infectious
beauty
to
his
words
with
mr
pound
there
is
no
eking
out
of
thin
sentiment
with
a
melody
or
a
song
he
writes
out
of
an
exuberance
of
incontinently
struggling
ideas
and
passionate
convictions
he
plunges
straight
into
the
heart
of
his
theme
and
suggests
virility
in
action
combined
with
fierceness
eagerness
and
tenderness
he
has
individuality
passion
force
and
an
acquaintance
with
things
that
are
profoundly
moving
begins
his
review
of
mr
pound
book
with
a
remark
that
he
would
like
much
more
space
in
which
to
discuss
his
work
and
also
notes
a
certain
use
of
spondee
and
dactyl
which
comes
in
strangely
and
as
we
first
read
it
with
the
appearance
of
discord
but
afterwards
seems
to
gain
a
curious
and
distinctive
vigour
