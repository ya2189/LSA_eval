darkling
dream
effulgency
fuel
of
vision
brief
embodiment
of
wandering
will
and
wastage
of
the
strong
fierce
ecstacy
of
one
tremendous
hour
when
ages
piled
on
ages
were
a
flame
to
all
the
years
behind
and
years
to
be
yet
any
sunset
were
as
much
as
this
save
for
the
music
forced
by
hands
of
fire
from
out
the
hard
strait
silences
which
bind
dull
matter
tongueless
mouth
a
music
pierced
with
the
tense
voice
of
life
more
quick
to
cry
its
agony
and
save
that
i
believed
the
radiance
redder
for
the
blood
of
men
destruction
hastens
and
intensifies
the
process
that
is
beauty
manifests
ranges
of
form
unknown
before
and
gives
motion
and
voice
and
hue
where
otherwise
bleak
inexpressiveness
had
leveled
all
if
one
create
there
is
the
lengthy
toil
the
laboured
years
and
days
league
an
end
less
than
the
measure
of
desire
mayhap
after
the
sure
consuming
of
all
strength
and
strain
of
faculties
that
otherwhere
were
loosed
upon
enjoyment
and
at
last
remains
to
one
capacity
nor
power
for
pleasure
in
the
thing
that
he
hath
made
but
on
destruction
hangs
but
little
use
of
time
or
faculty
but
all
is
turned
to
the
one
purpose
unobstructed
pure
of
sensuous
rapture
and
observant
joy
and
from
the
intensities
of
death
and
ruin
one
draws
a
heightened
and
completer
life
and
both
extends
and
vindicates
himself
i
would
i
were
a
god
with
all
the
scope
of
attributes
that
are
the
essential
core
of
godhead
and
its
visibility
i
am
but
emperor
and
hold
awhile
the
power
to
hasten
death
upon
his
way
and
cry
a
halt
to
worn
and
lagging
life
for
others
but
for
mine
own
self
may
not
delay
the
one
nor
bid
the
other
speed
there
have
been
many
kings
and
they
are
dead
and
have
no
power
in
death
save
what
the
wind
confers
upon
their
blown
and
brainless
dust
to
vex
the
eyeballs
of
posterity
but
were
i
god
i
would
be
overlord
of
many
kings
and
were
as
breath
to
guide
their
dust
of
destiny
and
were
i
god
exempt
from
this
mortality
which
clogs
perception
and
clear
exercise
of
will
what
rapture
it
would
be
if
but
to
watch
destruction
crouching
at
the
back
of
time
the
tongueless
dooms
which
dog
the
travelling
suns
the
vampire
silence
at
the
breast
of
worlds
fire
without
light
that
gnaws
the
base
of
things
and
lethe
mounting
tide
that
rots
the
stone
of
fundamental
spheres
this
were
enough
till
such
time
as
the
dazzled
wings
of
will
came
up
with
power
accession
scarcely
felt
for
very
suddenness
then
would
i
urge
the
strong
contention
and
conflicting
might
of
chaos
and
creation
matching
them
those
immemorial
powers
inimical
and
all
their
stars
and
gulfs
subservient
dynasts
of
time
and
anarchs
of
the
dark
in
closer
war
reverseless
and
would
set
new
discord
at
the
universal
core
a
to
bring
it
down
in
one
magnificence
of
ruin
yea
the
monster
chaos
were
mine
unleashed
hound
and
all
my
power
destruction
own
right
arm
i
would
exult
to
mark
the
smouldering
stars
renew
beneath
my
breath
their
elder
fire
and
feed
upon
themselves
to
nothingness
the
might
of
suns
with
swinging
weight
of
myriad
worlds
were
made
at
my
desire
one
long
rapidity
of
roaring
light
through
which
the
voice
of
life
were
audible
and
singing
of
the
immemorial
dead
whose
dust
is
loosened
into
vaporous
wings
with
soaring
wrack
of
systems
ruinous
and
were
i
weary
of
the
glare
of
these
i
would
tear
out
the
eyes
of
light
and
stand
above
a
chaos
of
extinguished
suns
that
crowd
and
grind
and
shiver
thunderously
lending
vast
voice
and
motion
but
no
ray
to
the
stretched
silence
of
the
blinded
gulfs
thus
would
i
give
my
godhead
space
and
speech
for
its
assertion
and
thus
pleasure
it
hastening
the
feet
of
time
with
casts
of
worlds
like
careless
pebbles
or
with
shattered
suns
brightening
the
aspect
of
eternity
chant
to
sirius
what
nights
retard
thee
o
sirius
thy
light
is
as
a
spear
and
thou
penetratest
them
as
a
warrior
that
stabbeth
his
foe
even
to
the
center
of
his
life
thy
rays
reach
farther
than
the
gulfs
they
form
a
bridge
thereover
that
shall
endure
till
the
links
of
the
universe
are
unfastened
and
drop
apart
and
all
the
gulfs
are
one
dissevered
by
suns
no
longer
how
strong
art
thou
in
thy
place
thou
stridest
thine
orbit
and
the
darkness
shakes
beneath
thee
as
a
road
that
is
trodden
by
an
army
thou
art
a
god
in
thy
temple
that
is
hollowed
with
light
in
the
night
of
infinitude
and
whose
floor
is
the
lower
void
thy
worlds
are
as
priests
and
ministers
therein
thou
furrowest
space
even
as
an
husbandman
and
sowest
it
with
alien
seed
it
beareth
alien
fruits
and
these
are
thy
testimony
even
as
the
crops
of
his
fields
are
the
testimony
of
an
husbandman
the
i
a
voice
cried
to
me
in
a
dawn
of
dreams
saying
make
haste
the
webs
of
death
and
birth
are
brushed
away
and
all
the
threads
of
earth
wear
to
the
breaking
spaceward
gleams
thine
ancient
pathway
of
the
suns
whose
flame
is
part
of
thee
and
deeps
outreach
immutably
whose
largeness
runs
through
all
thy
spirit
mystery
go
forth
and
tread
unharmed
the
blaze
of
stars
where
through
thou
camest
in
old
days
pierce
without
fear
each
vast
whose
hugeness
crushed
thee
not
within
the
past
a
hand
strikes
off
the
chains
of
time
a
hand
swings
back
the
door
of
years
now
fall
earth
bonds
of
gladness
and
of
tears
and
opens
the
strait
dream
to
space
sublime
ii
who
rides
a
dream
what
hand
shall
stay
what
eye
shall
note
or
measure
mete
his
passage
on
a
purpose
fleet
the
thread
and
weaving
of
his
way
it
caught
me
from
the
clasping
world
and
swept
beyond
the
brink
of
sense
my
soul
was
flung
and
poised
and
whirled
like
to
a
planet
chained
and
hurled
with
solar
lightning
strong
and
tense
swift
as
communicated
rays
that
leap
from
severed
suns
a
gloom
within
whose
waste
no
suns
illume
the
wingèd
dream
fulfilled
its
ways
through
years
reversed
and
lit
again
i
followed
that
unending
chain
wherein
the
suns
are
links
of
light
retraced
through
lineal
ordered
spheres
the
twisting
of
the
threads
of
years
in
weavings
wrought
of
noon
and
night
through
stars
and
deeps
i
watched
the
dream
unroll
those
folds
that
form
the
raiment
of
the
soul
iii
enkindling
dawns
of
memory
each
sun
had
radiance
to
relume
a
sealed
disused
and
darkened
room
within
the
soul
immensity
their
alien
ciphers
shown
and
lit
i
understood
what
each
had
writ
upon
my
spirit
scroll
again
i
wore
mine
ancient
lives
and
knew
the
freedom
and
the
gyves
that
formed
and
marked
my
soul
iv
i
delved
in
each
forgotten
mind
the
units
that
had
builded
me
whose
deepnesses
before
were
blind
and
formless
as
infinity
knowing
again
each
former
world
from
planet
unto
planet
whirled
through
gulfs
that
mightily
divide
like
to
an
intervital
sleep
one
world
i
found
where
souls
abide
like
winds
that
rest
upon
a
rose
thereto
they
creep
to
loose
all
burden
of
old
woes
and
one
i
knew
where
warp
of
pain
is
woven
in
the
soul
attire
and
one
where
with
new
loveliness
is
strengthened
beauty
olden
chain
soft
as
a
sound
and
keen
as
fire
in
light
no
darkness
may
depress
v
where
no
terrestrial
dreams
had
trod
my
vision
entered
undismayed
and
life
her
hidden
realms
displayed
to
me
as
to
a
curious
god
where
colored
suns
of
systems
triplicate
bestow
on
planets
weird
ineffable
green
light
that
orbs
them
like
an
outer
sea
and
large
auroral
noons
that
alternate
with
skies
like
sunset
held
without
abate
life
touch
renewed
incomprehensibly
the
strains
of
mirth
and
grief
harmonious
spell
dead
passions
like
to
stars
relit
shone
in
the
gloom
of
ways
forgot
where
crownless
gods
in
darkness
sit
the
day
was
full
on
altars
hot
i
heard
once
more
a
part
of
it
the
central
music
of
the
pleiades
and
to
alcyone
my
soul
swayed
with
the
stars
that
own
her
song
control
unchallenged
glad
i
trod
a
revenant
in
worlds
edenic
longly
lost
or
walked
in
spheres
that
sing
to
these
space
no
light
has
crossed
diverse
as
hell
mad
antiphone
uptossed
to
heaven
angelic
chant
vi
what
vasts
the
dream
went
out
to
find
i
seemed
beyond
the
world
recall
in
gulfs
where
darkness
is
a
wall
to
render
strong
antares
blind
in
unimagined
spheres
i
found
the
sequence
of
my
being
round
some
life
where
firstling
meed
of
song
the
strange
imperishable
leaf
was
placed
on
brows
that
starry
grief
had
crowned
and
pain
anointed
long
some
avatar
where
love
sang
like
the
last
great
star
at
morn
ere
death
filled
all
its
sky
some
life
in
fresher
years
unworn
upon
a
world
whereof
peace
was
a
robe
like
to
the
calms
that
lie
on
pools
aglow
with
latter
spring
there
life
pellucid
surface
took
clear
image
of
all
things
nor
shook
till
touch
of
death
obscuring
wing
some
earlier
awakening
in
pristine
years
when
giant
strife
of
forces
darkly
whirled
first
forged
the
thing
called
life
hot
from
the
furnace
of
the
suns
upon
the
anvil
of
a
world
vii
thus
knew
i
those
anterior
ones
whose
lives
in
mine
were
blent
till
lo
my
dream
that
held
a
night
where
rigel
sends
no
word
of
might
was
emptied
of
the
trodden
stars
and
dwindled
to
the
sun
extent
the
brain
familiar
and
raiment
of
the
sorrow
and
the
mirth
wrought
by
the
shuttles
intricate
of
earth
the
morning
pool
all
night
the
pool
held
mysteries
vague
depths
of
night
that
lay
in
dream
where
phantoms
of
the
stars
wandered
with
gleam
and
now
it
holds
the
limpid
light
and
shadeless
azure
of
the
skies
wherein
like
some
enclaspèd
gem
the
morning
golden
glamour
lies
the
night
forest
incumbent
seemingly
on
the
jagged
points
of
peaks
that
end
the
visible
west
the
rounded
moon
yet
floods
the
valleys
hitherward
with
fall
of
torrential
light
ere
from
the
overmost
aggressive
she
slip
to
the
lower
dark
but
here
on
an
eastward
slope
pointed
and
thick
with
its
pine
the
forest
scarcely
remembers
her
light
that
is
gone
as
a
vision
or
ecstasy
too
poignant
and
perilous
for
duration
withdrawn
in
what
darker
web
or
dimension
of
dream
i
know
not
in
silence
and
solemnest
rectitude
the
pines
uprear
and
no
sigh
for
the
rapture
of
moonlight
past
comes
from
their
bosom
of
boughs
far
in
their
secrecy
i
stand
and
the
burden
of
dusk
dull
but
at
times
made
keen
with
tingle
of
fragrances
falls
on
me
as
a
veil
between
my
soul
and
the
world
what
veil
of
trance
o
pines
divides
you
from
my
soul
that
i
feel
but
enter
not
your
distances
of
dream
ah
strange
imperative
sense
of
mystery
that
shakes
from
out
your
boughs
a
fragrance
yet
more
keen
pressing
upon
the
mind
the
wind
shall
question
you
of
the
dream
i
may
not
gain
and
all
its
sombreness
and
depth
immeasurable
shall
tremble
away
in
sound
of
speech
not
understood
that
my
heart
must
break
to
hear
the
mad
wind
what
hast
thou
seen
o
wind
of
beauty
or
of
terror
surpassing
denied
to
us
that
with
precipitate
wings
mad
and
ecstatical
thou
spurnest
the
hollows
and
trees
that
offer
thee
refuge
of
peace
and
findest
within
the
sky
no
safety
nor
respite
from
the
memory
of
thy
vision
song
to
oblivion
art
thou
more
fair
for
all
the
beauty
gathered
up
in
thee
as
gold
and
gems
within
some
lightless
sea
for
light
of
flowers
and
bloom
of
tinted
air
art
thou
more
fair
art
thou
more
strong
for
powers
that
turn
to
thee
as
unto
sleep
for
world
and
star
that
find
thy
ways
more
deep
than
light
may
tread
too
wearisome
for
song
art
thou
more
strong
nay
thou
art
bare
for
power
and
beauty
on
thine
impotence
bestowed
by
fruitful
time
magnificence
for
fruit
of
all
things
strong
and
bloom
of
fair
thou
still
art
bare
medusa
as
drear
and
barren
as
the
glooms
of
death
it
lies
a
windless
land
of
livid
dawns
nude
to
a
desolate
firmament
with
hills
that
seem
the
fleshless
earth
outjutting
ribs
and
plains
whose
face
is
crossed
and
rivelled
deep
with
gullies
twisting
like
a
serpent
track
the
leprous
touch
of
death
is
on
its
stones
where
for
his
token
visible
the
head
is
throned
upon
a
heap
of
monstrous
rocks
grotesque
in
everlasting
ugliness
within
a
that
splits
athwart
like
some
old
hideous
and
unhealing
scar
her
lethal
beauty
crowned
with
twining
snakes
that
mingle
with
her
hair
the
gorgon
reigns
her
eyes
are
clouds
wherein
death
lightnings
lurk
yet
even
as
men
that
seek
the
glance
of
life
the
gazers
come
where
coiled
and
those
levins
wait
as
an
her
victims
lie
distorted
blackened
forms
of
postured
horror
smitten
into
stone
time
caught
in
meshes
of
eternity
drawn
back
from
dust
and
ruin
of
the
years
and
given
to
all
the
future
of
the
world
the
land
is
claimed
of
death
the
daylight
comes
in
the
changing
webs
of
cloud
that
unseen
spiders
of
bewildered
winds
weave
and
unweave
across
the
lurid
sun
in
upper
air
below
no
zephyr
comes
to
break
with
life
the
circling
spell
of
death
long
twist
about
the
moon
and
in
the
windy
murkness
of
the
sky
the
guttering
stars
are
wild
as
that
near
the
socket
thus
the
land
shall
be
and
death
shall
wait
throned
in
medusa
eyes
till
in
the
irremeable
webs
of
night
the
sun
is
snared
and
the
corroded
moon
a
dust
upon
the
gulfs
and
all
the
stars
rotted
and
like
rivets
from
the
sky
letting
the
darkness
down
upon
all
things
ode
to
the
abyss
o
unalterable
one
whose
deep
sustains
world
and
sun
thou
wast
ere
ever
star
put
out
on
thee
and
thou
shalt
be
when
never
world
remains
when
all
the
suns
triumphant
strength
and
pride
is
sunk
in
voidness
absolute
and
their
majestic
music
wide
in
vaster
silence
rendered
mute
and
though
god
will
were
night
to
dusk
the
blue
and
law
to
cancel
and
disperse
the
tangled
tissues
of
the
universe
and
mould
the
suns
anew
his
might
were
impotent
to
conquer
thee
o
invisible
infinity
thy
darks
subdue
all
light
that
treads
thee
down
a
space
exulting
thy
deeps
the
cycles
die
and
lo
thy
darkness
reaps
the
flame
of
mightiest

thy

through

what

that

essay
time
undimensioned
vast
shall
plunge
forgotten
to
thy
gloom
at
length
with
life
that
cried
its
query
of
the
night
to
ears
with
silence
filled
what
worlds
unborn
shall
dare
thy
strength
girt
by
a
sun
unwearied
might

dip
to
darkness
when
the

stupendous
thunder
of
the

of
orbits
that
diverged
with
life
thin
song
are
merged
thy

enfold

thy

what
plottest
thou
within
thy

dark
as
the

lull

suns
what
new

of
the
night
on
citadels
of

around
whose

thy

encroachment
runs
and
crouching
silence
sleeps
the

of
the

a
wind
comes
in
from

and
rolls
through
the

tide
it
pours
adown
the

and
rears
at

unsatisfied
with
ravin
of

of

come
forth
on

to

of
tideless

it

with

earth
voices

her
high
and

lo
thou
art
as
dreams
and
to
thy
realm
all
hidden
things
belong
all
fugitive
and
evanescent
gleams
the
soul
hath
vainly
sought
all

immanence
all
visions

magnificence
and
great
ideals
pinnacled
in

all
paths
with
marvel
fraught

lands
obscure

upon
thy
road
of

we
pass
seeking
thy
magic
lure
to
vales
and
unsure
where
all
seems
strange
as
visions
in
a
glass
and
hills
where
beauty
is
an
echo
and
a
dream
in
sighing
pines
and
rills
clouded
and
deep
with
imaged
tree
and
sky
and
where
bright
rivers
gleam
past
cities
towering
high
each
wonderful
as
some
thou
loosenest
the
bondage
of
the
years
making
the
spirit
free
of
all
sublunar
joys
and
fears
who
mounts
on
thine
imperious
wings
shall
see
the
ways
of
life
as
threads
of
day
and
night
serene
above
their
change
his
eyes
shall
know
but
far
transcendent
things
his
ears
shall
hark
but
voices
free
and
strange
vast
seas
of
outer
light
shall
beat
upon
his
sight
eternal
winds
shall
touch
him
with
their
wings
his
heart
shall
thrill
to
larger
purer
joy
and
grief
more
deep
than
earth
may
know
and
as
dews
of
morning
fill
the
opened
flower
into
his
soul
shall
flow
high
melodies
like
tears
that
angels
weep
then
shall
he
penetrate
the
veils
and
outer
barriers
of
sound
and
near
the
soul
of
melody
where
rapt
in
aural
splendors
ultimate
his
soul
shall
see
the
marvel
and
the
glory
that
surround
eternal
beauty
shrine
and
catch
afar
the
glint
divine
of
her
robe
or
haply
hear
with
ear
some
echo
of
her
voice
mystery
thou
hast
love
power
to
find
the
soul
most
secret
chords
that
else
were
still
and
them
till
they
thrill
disclosed
to

faint
movements
of
thy

thine
aural
sorcery
the

as
sunset
storms
the
sight
for
thou

beauty
bodied
forth
in
sound
her
colors
bright
and
diverse
forms
expressed
in
harmony
within
thy
bound
the
flare
of
morning
is
become
a
song
and
tree
and
flower
a
music
sweet
and
long
and
in
thy
speech
the
power
and
majesty
that
swing
planet
and
sun
and
each
dim
atom
of
the
system
manifest
become
articulate
expressed
like
ocean
in

brooklet
whispering
beyond
the
woof
of
finite
things
thy
threads

intertexturings
within

with
song
mayhap
to
be
his
memories
for
beauty
borders
nigh
the
ultimate
eternal
verities
the
last
night
i
dreamed
a
dream
i
stood
upon
a
height
a
mountain
utmost
eminence
of
snow
whence
i
beheld
the
plain
outstretched
below
to
a
far
dim
and
white
beneath
the
sun
expiring
ghastly
light
the
dead
world
lay
phantasmally
aglow
its
last
voice
a
wind
came
low
the
distant
sea
lay
hushed
as
with
affright
i
watched
and
lo
the
pale
and
flickering
sun
in
agony
and
fierce
despair
flamed
high
and
went
out
upon
the
gloom
then
night
that
grim
gigantic
struggle
won
impended
for
a
breath
on
wings
of
doom
and
through
the
air
fell
like
a
falling
sky
ode
on
imagination
imagination
eyes
outreach
and
distance
far
the
vision
of
the
greatest
star
that
measures
instantaneously
enisled
therein
as
in
a
sea
its
cincture
of
the
skies
abysses
closed
about
with
night
a
tribute
yield
to
her
retardless
sight
and
matter
gates
disclose
the
candent
ores
in
furnaces
of
she
penetrates
the
sun
transplendent
shield
and
through
the
obstruction
of
his
vestment
dire
pierces
the
centermost
sublimity
of
his
terrific
heart
whose
gurge
of
fire
heaves
upward
like
a
monstrous
sea
and
inly
riven
by
titanic
throes
fills
all
his
frame
with
outward
cataract
of
separate
and
immingling
torrent
streams
her
eyes
exact
from
the
that
wanes
and
grows
in
wastes
celestial
alien
dreams
brought
down
on
wings
of
fleetest
beams
adown
the
clefts
of
she
rides
her
steed
a
falling
star
to
seek
where
void
and
vagueness
are
some
mark
or
certainty
of
place
upon
their
heavenly
precipice
the
gathered
suns
shrink
back
aghast
from
that
interminate
abyss
and
threat
of
sightless
anarchs
vast
she
stands
endued
with
supermundane
crown
and
vestitures
of
emperies
that
include
all
and
of
dream
kingdoms
and
eminent
heights
extreme
where
light
endures
she
wanders
in
fantastic
lands
where
grow
in
fields
and
closes
blind
vague
blossoms
stirred
by
wings
of
eidolons
or
roves
in
forests
where
all
sound
is
low
each
voice
that
shuns
the
noiseful
day
and
enters
there
to
find
twilight
that
naught
exalts
nor
grieves
is
quickly
tuned
to
the
susurrous
leaves
upon
some
supersensual
eminence
she
hears
the
fragments
of
a
thunder
loud
where
lightnings
of
ulterior
truth
intense
flame
through
the
walls
of
hollow
cloud
but
these
she
may
not
wholly
grasp
with
incomplete
terrestrial
clasp
her
eyes
inevitably
see
rounds
and
changes
of
exterior
things
the
movements
of
essentiality
of
ageless
principles
that
alter
not
to
temporal
alterings
unswerved
by
shattered
worlds
upbuilt
once
more
and
stars
no
longer
hot
or
broken
constellations
strewn
like
coals
about
the
heavenly
floor
and
rush
of
night
upon
the
noon
of
their
lost
worlds
unsphered
restorelessly
in
icy
deserts
of
the
sky
from
the
beginning
of
the
spheres
when
systems
nebulous
drove
back
the
brinks
of
nullity
with
limitary
marks
till
end
of
suns
and
sunless
death
of
years
to
her
are
known
the
unevident
inseparable
links
that
bind
all
deeps
all
suns
all
days
and
darks
the
wind
and
the
moon
oh
list
to
the
wind
of
the
night
oh
hark
how
it
shrieks
as
it
goes
on
its
hurrying
quest
forever
its
voice
is
a
voice
of
the
dark
forever
its
voice
is
a
voice
of
unrest
oh
list
to
the
pines
as
they
shiver
and
sway
the
ceaseless
beat
of
its
myriad
wings
how
they
moan
and
they
sob
like
living
things
that
cry
in
the
darkness
for
light
and
day
now
bend
they
low
as
the
wind
mounts
higher
and
its
eerie
voice
comes
piercingly
like
the
plaint
of
humanity
misery
and
its
burden
of
vain
desire
now
to
a
sad
tense
whisper
it
fails
then
wildly
and
madly
it
raves
and
it
wails
oh
the
night
is
filled
with
its
sob
and
its
shriek
its
weird
and
its
restless
yearning
cry
as
it
races
adown
the
darkened
sky
with
scurry
of
broken
clouds
that
seek
borne
on
the
wings
of
the
hastening
wind
a
place
of
rest
that
they
never
can
find
and
around
the
face
of
the
moon
they
cling
its
fugitive
face
to
veil
they
aspire
but
ever
and
ever
it
peereth
out
rending
the
that
hem
it
about
and
it
seemeth
a
lost
and
phantom
thing
like
a
phantom
of
dead
desire
lament
of
the
stars
one
tone
is
mute
within
the
starry
singing
the
unison
fulfilled
complete
before
one
chord
within
the
music
sounds
no
more
and
from
the
stir
of
flames
forever
winging
the
pinions
of
our
sister
motionless
in
pits
of
indefinable
duress
are
fallen
beyond
all
recovery
by
exultation
of
the
flying
dance
or
rhythms
holding
as
with
sleep
or
trance
the
maze
of
stars
that
only
death
may
free
flung
through
the
void
expanse
in
gulfs
depressed
nor
in
the
gulfs
exalted
shall
shade
nor
lightening
of
her
flame
be
found
in
space
that
litten
orbits
gird
around
nor
in
the
bottomless
abyss
unvaulted
of
unenvironed
night
allotted
gyre
nor
lawless
shall
find
and
with
its
venturous
ray
return
from
gloom
of
undiscoverable
scope
one
ray
of
her
to
gladden
into
hope
the
doubtful
eyes
denied

morningless

girt
for
the

funereal
inviolate

earless

that

calm
unbreaking
where

many

that
tower

our

one

one

one
shadow
crowding
out
the

debar

sleep
is
a
pathless
labyrinth
dark
to
the
gaze
of
moons
and
suns
through
which
the
colored
clue
of
dreams
a
gossamer
thread
obscurely
runs
the
winds
to
me
the
winds
that
die
and
start
and
strive
in
wars
that
never
cease
are
dearer
than
the
level
peace
that
lies
unstirred
at
summer
heart
more
dear
to
me
the
shadowed
wold
where
with
report
of
tempest
rife
the
air
intensifies
with
life
than
quiet
fields
of
summer
gold
i
am
the
winds
admitted
friend
they
seal
our
linked
fellowships
with
speech
of
warm
or
icy
lips
with
touch
of
west
and
east
that
blend
and
when
my
spirit
listless
stands
with
folded
wings
that
do
not
live
their
own
assuageless
wings
they
give
to
lift
her
from
the
stirless
lands
within
the
place
unmanifest
where
central
truth
is
immanent
lies
there
a
vast
entire
content
of
sound
and
movement
one
in
rest
i
know
not
this
yet
in
my
heart
i
feel
that
where
all
truths
concur
the
shrine
is
peaceless
with
the
stir
of
winds
that
enter
and
depart
the
masque
of
forsaken
gods
scene
moonlit
glade
on
a
summer
the
poet
what
consummation
of
the
toiling
moon
the
midnight
blue
with
violet
wherein
the
stars
turn
grey
the
summer
green
edgèd
and
strong
by
day
is
dull
and
faint
beneath
the
moon
mood
that
in
this
absence
of
the
impassioned
sun
sways
to
a
sleep
of
sound
and
calm
of
color
the
live
and
vivid
aspect
of
the
world
subdued
as
with
the
great
expectancy
which
blurs
beginning
features
of
a
dream
things
and
events
lost
an
omening
of
central
and
oppressive
bulk
to
come
here
were
the
theatre
of
a
miracle
if
such
within
a
world
long
alienate
from
its
first
dreams
and
shut
with
skeptic
years
might
now
befall
the
philosopher
the
huntress

the
upturned
faces
of

the
dead
shell
of
a
frozen
world
glittering
with
desolation

old

the
gods
that

like
dreams
each
planet
youth
are
fled
from
years
incredulous
and
tired
with
penetrating
of
successive
masks
that
give
but
emptiness
they
served
to
hide
remains
not
faith
enough
to
bring
them
back
pan
to
his
wood
diana
to
her
moon
and
all
the
visions
that
made
populous
an
eager
world
where
time
grows
weary
now
yet
youth
that
lives
might
for
a
little
claim
the
pantheon
of
dream
on
such
a
night
when
the
growing
marvel
of
the
moon
the
films
of
time
wear
perilously
thin
and
thought
looks
backward
to
the
simpler
years
till
all
the
vision
seems
but
just
beyond
if
one
have
faith
it
may
be
that
he
shall
behold
the
gods
once
only
and
no
more
because
of
time
inhospitality
for
which
they
may
not
stay
the
poet
within
the
marvel
of
the
light
what
flower
of
active
wonder
from
quiescence
springs
is
it
a
throng
of
luminous
white
clouds
phantoms
of
some
old
storm
titans
that
float
beneath
the
moon
and
speak
with
voices
like
the
last
echoes
of
a
thunder
spent
is
the
forsaken
gods
that
win
a
foothold
about
the
magic
circle
which
the
moon
draws
like
some
old
enchantress
round
the
glade
the
philosopher
i
see
them
not
the
vision
is
addressed
only
to
thine
acute
and
eager
youth
jove
all
heaven
and
earth
were
once
my
throne
now
i
have
but
the
wind
alone
for
shifting
the
pillared
world
supported
me
yet
man
old
incredulity
left
nothing
for
my
feet
pan
man
hath
forgotten
me
yet
seems
it
that
my
memory
saddens
the
wistful
voices
of
the
wood
within
each
spot
echo
forgets
my
music
not
nor
earth
my
tread
where
trampling
years
have
stood
artemis
time
hath
grown
cold
toward
beauty
loved
of
old
the
gods
must
quake
when
dreams
and
hopes
forsake
the
heart
of
man
and
disillusion
ban
more
chill
than
stone
rears
till
the
former
throne
of
loveliness
is
dark
and
tenantless
now
must
i
weep
homeless
within
the
deep
where
once
of
old
mine
orbèd
chariot
rolled
and
mourn
in
vain
man
immemorial
pain
uncomforted
of
light
and
beauty
fled
apollo
time
wearied
of
my
song
a
satiate
and
capricious
king
who
for
his
pleasure
bade
me
sing
first
of
his
minstrel
throng
till
cloyed
with
melody
his
ear
grew
faint
to
voice
and
lyre
forgotten
then
of
time
desire
his
thought
was
void
of
me
aphrodite
i
born
of

of
the

upon
mankind
fuelled
with
syria

with

time
fanned
me
with
his

love
found
new
warmth
in
me
and
life
its
ecstasy
till
i
grew
deadly
with
the
wind
of
death
a
nymph
how
can
the
world
be
still
so
beautiful
when
beauty
self
is
fled
tis
like
the
mute
and
marble
loveliness
of
some
dead
girl
and
we
that
hover
here
are
as
the
spirit
of
former
voice
and
motion
and
live
color
in
that
which
shall
not
stir
nor
speak
again
another
nymph
nay
rather
say
this
lovely
lifeless
world
is
but
a
rigid
semblance
counterfeiting
the
world
which
was
nor
have
the
gods
retained
such
power
as
once
informed
and
rendered
vital
the
cryptic
irresponsiveness
of
stone
that
statue
which
pygmalion
made

atè
i
who

alone
of
all

that

hath
no
need
of

no

that
i
might
fill
again
the

tell
me
o
gods
are
ye
forever
doomed
to
fall
and
flutter
among
spacial
winds
finding
release
nor
foothold
anywhere
debarred
from
doors
of
all
the
suns
like
spirits
whose

are
blotted
from
the
lists
of
time
though
they
themselves
yet
wander
undestroyed
the
gods
together
throneless
discrowned
and
impotent
in
man
sad
disillusionment
we
passed
with
earth
returnless
youth
who
were
the
semblances
of
truth
the
veils
that
hid
the
vacantness
infinite
naked
meaningless
the
blank
and
universal
sphinx
each
world
beholds
at
last
and
sinks
new
gods
protect
awhile
the
gaze
of
man
each
one
a
veil
that
stays
till
the
new
gods
discredited
like
mist
that
melts
with
noon
are
fled
that
power
oppressive
limitless
the
tyranny
of
nothingness
our
power
is
dead
upon
the
earth
with
the
first
dews
and
dawns
of
time
but
in
the
far
and
younger
clime
of
other
worlds
it
hath
yea
though
we
find
not
entrance
here
astray
like
feathers
on
the
wind
to
neither
earth
nor
heaven
consigned
fresh
altars
in
a
distant
sphere
are
keen
with
fragrance
bright
with
fire
new
hearths
to
warm
us
from
the
night
till
banished
thence
we
pass
in
flight
while
all
the
flames
of
dream
expire
a
sunset
as
blood
from
some
enormous
hurt
the
sanguine
sunset
leapt
across
it
like
a
dabbled
skirt
the
hurrying
tempest
swept
the
what
islands
marvellous
are
these
that
gem
the
sunset
tides
of
light
opals
aglow
in
saffron
seas
how
beautiful
they
lie
and
bright
like
some
hesperides
what
varied
changing
magic
hues
tint
gorgeously
each
shore
and
hill
what
blazing
vivid
golds
and
blues
their
seaward
winding
valleys
fill
what
amethysts
their
peaks
suffuse
close
held
by
curving
arms
of
land
that
out
within
the
ocean
reach
i
mark
a
faery
city
stand
set
high
upon
a
sloping
beach
that
burns
with
fire
of
shimmering
sand
of
is
formed
each
wall
each
dome
a
seems
and
every
spire
that
towers
tall
a
ray
of
golden
moonlight
gleams
of
is
every
hall
alas
how
quickly
dims
their
glow
what
veils
their
dreamy
splendours
mar
like
broken
dreams
the
islands
go
as
down
from
strands
of
cloud
and
star
the
sinking
tides
of
daylight
flow
the
but
yestereve
the
winter
trees
reared
leafless
blackly
bare
their
twigs
and
branches
upon
the
opens
now
the
dawn
and
in
its
pallid
glow
revealed
each
barren
tree
stands
white
with
flowers
of
snow
the
summer
moon
how
is
it
o
moon
that
melting
unstintedly
prodigally
on
the
peaks
hard
majesty
till
they
seem
diaphanous
and
fluctuant
as
a
veil
and
pouring
thy
rapturous
light
through
pine
and
oak
and
laurel
till
the
green
softening
and
tremulous
is
a
lustrous
miracle
how
is
it
that
i
find
when
i
turn
again
to
thee
that
thy
lost
and
wasted
light
is
regained
in
one
magic
breath
the
return
of
hyperion
the
of
tartarus
are
just
beyond
yon
whose
mass
is
bound
around
the
bulk
of
the
dark
unstirred
unmoving
east
alike
on
the
mountains
and
the
plain
the
night
is
as
some
terrific
dream
that
closes
the
soul
in
a
crypt
of
dread
apart
from
touch
or
sense
of
earth
as
in
the
space
of
eternity
what
light
unseen
perturbs
the
darkness
behold
it
stirs
and
fluctuates
between
the
mountains
and
the
stars
that
are
set
as
guards
above
the
prison
of
the
captive
i
know
that
in
the
deeps
beneath
hyperion
divides
the
pillared
vault
of
dark
and
stands
a
space
upon
its
ruin
then
light
is
laid
upon
the
peaks
as
the
hand
of
one
who
climbs
beyond
and
lo
the
sun
the
sentinel
stars
are
dead
with
overpotent
flame
and
in
their
place
hyperion
stands
the
night
is
loosened
from
the
land
as
a
dream
from
the
mind
of
the
dreamer
a
great
wind
blows
across
the
dawn
like
the
wind
of
the
motion
of
the
world
lethe
i
flow
beneath
the
columns
that
upbear
the
world
and
all
the
tracts
of
heaven
and
hell
foamless
i
sweep
where
sounds
nor
glimmers
tell
my
motion
no
moment
flare
gives
each
to
each
the
shapes
that
unaware
commingle
at
my
verge
to
test
the
spell
of
waves
intense
with
night
whose
deeps
compel
one
face
from
pain
and
rapture
and
despair
the
fruitless
earth
denied
and
cheated
sons
meet
here
where
fruitful
and
unfruitful
cease
and
when
their
lords
the
mightier
hidden
ones
have
drained
all
worlds
till
being
wine
is
low
shall
they
not
come
and
from
the
oblivious
flow
drink
at
one
draught
a
universe
of
peace
atlantis
above
its
domes
the
gulfs
accumulate
to
where
the
trumpet
forth
their
screed
but
here
the
buried
waters
take
no
heed
deaf
and
with
closèd
lips
from
press
of
weight
imposed
by
ocean
dim
inanimate
on
temples
of
an
unremembered
creed
involved
in
long
slow
tentacles
of
weed
the
dead
tide
lies
immovable
as
fate
from
out
the
a
clouded
light
is
questionably
shed
on
altars
of
a
goddess
garlanded
with
blossoms
of
some
weird
and
hueless
vine
and
wingèd
fleet
through
skies
beneath
the
foam
like
silent
birds
the
dart
and
shine
the
unrevealed
how
dense
the
glooms
of
death
impervious
to
aught
of
old
memorial
light
how
strait
the
sunless
road
suspended
separate
that
leads
to
later
birth
untremulous
with
any
secret
morn
of
stars
to
us
the
past
is
closed
as
with
division
great
of
seas
unknown
its
gate
beyond
the
mouths
of
shadows
cavernous
oh
may
it
be
that
death
in
kindness
strips
the
soul
of
memory
raiment
rendering
blind
our
vision
lest
surmounted
deeps
appal
as
when
on
mountain
peaks
a
glance
behind
betrays
with
knowledge
and
the
climber
slips
down
gulfs
of
fear
to
some
enormous
fall
the
eldritch
dark
now
as
the
twilight
doubtful
interval
closes
with
night
accomplished
certainty
a
wizard
wind
goes
crying
eerily
and
in
the
glade
unsteady
shadows
crawl
timed
to
the
trees
whose
voices
rear
and
fall
as
with
some
dreadful
witches
ecstasy
flung
upward
to
the
dark
whence
glitters
free
the
crooked
moon
impendent
over
all
twin
veils
of
covering
cloud
and
silence
thrown
across
the
movement
and
the
sound
of
things
make
blank
the
night
till
in
the
broken
west
the
moon
ensanguined
blade
awhile
is
shown
the
night
grows
whole
again
the
shadows
rest
gathered
beneath
a
greater
shadow

the
the

falling
now
down
from
the
sky
of
twig
and
bough
in
widely
settling
whirls
they
fly
the
orchard
earth
unclothed
and
brown
is
with

bright
as

glimmer
down
brief
as

this

lighted

nearer
to

past
the

new

poised
as
a

whose

detachèd
post
an
eyrie
pends
between
the
of
finite
years

those
unvaried
darks
that

eternity
i
saw
the
host
of
worlds
and
suns
swept
from
the
furthermost
of
night
confusion
as
of
dust
with
sparks
whirl
the
opposing
brink
as
one
who
harks
some
warning
trumpet

a
withered
ghost
fled
with

disunited
orbs
that

were
atoms
of
the

they
passed
to
some
eternal
and
lo
the
gods
from
space
discorporate
who
were
its
life
and
vital
spirit
came
drawn
outward
by
the
of
sleep
the
nemesis
of

lo
what
are
these
the
gyres
of
sun
and
world
fulfilled
with
daylight
by
each
toiling
sun
lo
what
are
these
but
webs
of
radiance
spun
beneath
the
roof
of
night
and
torn
or
furled
by
night
at
will
all
opposite
powers
upwhirled
are
less
than
chaff
to
this
imperious
one
as
chaff
until
its
sport
be
done
scattered
and
lifted
up
and
downward
hurled
all
gyres

held
within
the
path
unspanned
of
night
aeonian
compass
loosely
pent
as
with
the
embrace
of
weight
all
suns
are
grasped
within
the
hollow
hand
of
night
the
godhead
sole
omnipotent
whose

white
death
methought
the
world
was
bound
with
final
frost
the
sun
made
hueless
as
with
fear
and
awe
illumined
yet
the
lands
it
could
not
thaw
then
on
my
road
with
instant
evening
crost
death
stood
and
in
its
shadowy
films
enwound
mine
eyes
forgot
the
light
until
i
came
where
poured
the
inseparate
unshadowed
flame
of
phantom
suns
in
drowned
death
lay
revealed
in
all
its
haggardness
immitigable
wastes
horizonless
profundities
that
held
nor

what
hand
is
this
that
unresisted
grips
my
spirit
as
with
chains
and
from
the
sound

of

compels
me
to
the

where
darkness
waits
with

all

of

girt
around
with
sense

unswervable
eclipse
so
lies
a
land
whose
noon
is
plagued
with
whirr
of
bats
than
their

shadows
swarthier
whose
flight
is

on
roofs
of
white
abodes
wherein
from

from

in
hieroglyphics
of
abhorrent
doom

slowly
trailed
the

of

compel
the

to

their

forms

is

inurned
a
space

i

their

turned
where
holders
of
the

exultant
rose
and
sank
to

the

of
systems

that

along

unimplicated
in
their
doom
the

and

where

gather

and
dip
again
into
the

of
things
to
watch
it
shift
and
burn
hearted
with
stars
on
peaceless
wings
i
pierce
where
all

old

osiris
ammon
thoth
came
on
my
dream
in

and
their

revealed
were
as
the
levin
fire
and
heat
the
hosts
of
rome
the
arab
and
the
goth
have
left
their
altars
dark
yet
stern
and
wroth
in
olden
power
they
stood
whose
wings
were
fleet
and
mighty
as
with
strength
of
storms
that
meet
in
mingled
foam
of
clouds
and
above
my
dream
with
arch
of
dreaded
wings
in
judgement
and
in
sentence
of
what
crime
i
knew
not
sate
the
gods
outcast
of
time
they
passed
and
lo
a
plague
of
darkness
fell
unsleeping
and
accurst
with
nameless
things
and
dreams
that
stood
the
ministers
of
hell
to
the
darkness
thou
hast
taken
the
light
of
many
suns
and
they
are
sealed
in
the
of
gloom
even
as
hast
thou
taken
the
souls
of
men
with
winds
from
out
a
hollow
place
they
are
hid
in
the
abyss
as
in
a
sea
and
the
gulfs
are
over
them
as
the
weight
of
many
peaks
as
the
depth
of
many
seas
thy
shields
are
between
them
and
the
light
they
are
past
its
burden
and
bitterness
the
spears
of
the
day
shall
not
touch
them
the
chains
of
the
sun
shall
not
hale
them
forth
many
men
there
were
in
the
days
that
are
now
of
thy
realm
that
thou
hast
sealed
with
the
seal
of
many
deeps
their
feet
were
as
eagles
wings
in
the
quest
of
truth
aye
mightily
they
desired
her
face
hunting
her
through
the
lands
of
life
as
men
in
the
blankness
of
the
waste
that
seek
for
a
buried
of
kings
but
against
them
were
the
veils
that
hands
may
not
rend
nor
sabers
pierce
and
truth
was
withheld
from
them
as
a
water
that
is
seen
afar
at
dawn
and
at
noon
is
lost
in
the
sand
before
the
feet
of
the
traveller
the
world
was
a
barrenness
and
the
gardens
were
as
the
waste
and
they
turned
them
to
the
adventure
of
the
dark
to
the
travelling
of
the
land
without
roads
to
the
sailing
of
the
sea
that
hath
no
beacons
why
have
they
not
returned
their
quest
hath
found
end
in
thee
or
surely
they
had
fared
once
more
to
the
place
whence
they
came
as
men
that
have
travelled
to
a
fruitless
land
they
have
looked
on
thy
face
and
to
them
it
is
the
countenance
of
truth
thy
silence
is
sweeter
to
them
than
the
voice
of
love
thine
embrace
more
dear
than
the
clasp
of
the
beloved
they
are
fed
with
the
emptiness
past
the
veil
and
their
hunger
is
filled
they
have
found
the
waters
of
peace
and
are
athirst
no
more
they
know
a
rest
that
is
deeper
than
the
gulfs
and
whose
seal
is
unbreakable
as
the
seal
of
the
void
they
sleep
the
sleep
of
the
suns
and
the
vast
is
a
garment
unto
them
a
dream
of
beauty
i
dreamed
that
each
most
lovely
perfect
thing
that
nature
hath
of
sound
and
form
and
hue
the
winds
the
grass
the
dew
the
gleam
and
swiftness
of
the
wing
blueness
of
sea
and
sky
and
gold
of
storm
transmuted
by
the
sunset
and
the
flame
of
leaves
before
me
came
and
meeting
merged
to
one
diviner
form
incarnate
beauty
was
whose
spirit
thrills
through
glaucous
ocean
and
the
greener
hills
and
in
the
peaks
is
pent
like
some
descended
star
she
hovered
but
as
i
gazed
in
doubt
and
wonderment
mine
eyes
were
dazzled
and
i
saw
no
more
the
all
drear
and
barren
seemed
the
hours
that
passed
and
the
dead
leaves
fell
like
brownish
notes
within
the
rain
grey
monotone
there
came
a
lapse
between
the
showers
the
clouds
grew
rich
with
sunset
gleams
then
the
sky
a
rainbow
sprang
a
bridge
unto
the
land
of
dreams
a
leaf
how
marvellous
this
bit
of
green
i
hold
and
soon
shall
throw
away
its
subtile
veins
its
vivid
sheen
seem
fragment
of
a
god
array
in
all
the
hidden
toil
of
earth
which
is
the
more
laborious
part
to
rear
the
oak
enormous
girth
or
shape
its
leaves
with
poignant
art
pine
needles
o
little
lances
dipped
in
grey
and
set
in
order
straight
and
clean
how
delicately
clear
and
keen
your
points
against
the
sapphire
day
attesting
nature
perfect
art
ye
fringe
the
limpid
firmament
o
little
lances
keenly
sent
to
pierce
with
beauty
to
the
heart
to
the
sun
thy
light
is
as
an
eminence
unto
thee
and
thou
are
upheld
by
the
pillars
of
thy
strength
thy
power
is
a
foundation
for
the
worlds
they
are
builded
thereon
as
upon
a
lofty
rock
whereto
no
enemy
hath
access
thou
puttest
forth
thy
rays
and
they
hold
the
sky
as
in
the
hollow
of
an
immense
hand
thou
erectest
thy
light
as
four
walls
and
a
roof
with
many
beams
and
pillars
thy
flame
is
a
stronghold
based
as
a
mountain
its
bastions
are
tall
and
firm
like
stone
the
worlds
are
bound
with
the
ropes
of
thy
will
like
steeds
are
they
stayed
and
contrained
by
the
reins
of
invisible
lightnings
with
bands
that
are
stouter
than
iron
manifold
and
stronger
than
the
cords
of
the
gulfs
thou
withholdest
them
from
the
brink
of
outward
and
perilous
deeps
lest
they
perish
in
the
desolations
of
the
night
or
be
stricken
of
strange
suns
lest
they
be
caught
in
the
pitfalls
of
the
abyss
or
fall
into
the
furnace
of
arcturus
thy
law
is
as
a
shore
unto
them
and
they
are
restrained
thereby
as
the
sea
thou
art
food
and
drink
to
the
worlds
yea
by
thy
toil
are
they
sustained
that
they
fail
not
upon
the
road
of
space
whose
goal
is
hercules
when
thy
pillars
of
force
are
withdrawn
and
the
walls
of
thy
light
fall
inward
borne
down
by
the
sundering
night
and
thy
head
is
covered
with
the
shadow
the
worlds
shall
wander
as
men
bewildered
in
the
sterile
and
lifeless
waste
athirst
and
unfed
shall
they
be
when
the
springs
of
thy
strength
are
dust
and
thy
fields
of
light
are
black
with
dearth
they
shall
perish
from
the
ways
that
thou
showest
no
longer
and
emptiness
shall
close
above
them
the
fugitives
o
fugitive
fragrances
that
tremble
heavenward
unceasing
or
if
ye
linger
halt
but
as
memories
on
the
verge
of
forgetfulness
why
must
ye
pass
so
fleetly
on
wings
that
are
less
than
wind
to
a
death
unknowable
soon
ye
are
gone
and
the
air
forgets
your
faint
unrest
in
the
garden
breathlessness
where
fall
the
snows
of
silence
averted
malefice
where
mandrakes
crying
from
the
moonless
fen
told
how
a
witch
with
gaze
of
owl
or
bat
found
and
each
root
malevolently
fat
pulled
for
her
waiting
cauldron
on
my
ken
upstole
escaping
to
the
world
of
men
a
vapor
as
of
some
infernal
vat
against
the
stars
it
clomb
and
caught
thereat
as
if
their
bright
regard
to
veil
again
despite
the
web
methought
they
saw
appalled
the
stealthier
weft
in
which
all
sound
was
still
then
sprang
as
if
the
night
found
breath
anew
a
wind
whereby
the
stars
were
disenthralled
far
off
i
heard
the
cry
of
frustrate
ill
a
witch
that
wailed
above
her
curdled
brew
the
medusa
of
the
skies
haggard
as
if
resurgent
from
a
tomb
the
moon
uprears
her
ghastly
shrunken
head
crowned
with
such
light
as
flares
upon
the
dead
from
pallid
skies
more
than
the
gloom
now
fall
her
beams
till
slope
and
plain
assume
the
whiteness
of
a
land
whence
life
is
fled
and
shadows
that
a
sepulcher
might
shed
move
livid
as
the
stealthy
hands
of
doom
rigid
hills
and
valleys
locked
and
mute
a
pallor
steals
as
of
a
world
made
still
when
death
that
erst
had
crept
stands
absolute
an
earth
now
frozen
fast
by
power
of
eyes
that
malefice
and
purposed
silence
fill
the
gaze
of
that
medusa
of
the
skies
a
dead
city
the
twilight
reigns
above
the
fallen
noon
within
an
ancient
land
whose
lies
like
a
shadow
its
ruined
prime
like
rising
mist
the
night
increases
soon
round
shattered
palaces
ere
yet
the
moon
on
mute
unsentried
walls
and
turrets
climb
and
touch
with
whiteness
of
sepulchral
rime
the
desert
where
a
city
bones
are
strewn
she
comes
at
last
unburied
thick
they
show
in
all
the
hoary
nakedness
of
stone
from
out
a
shadow
like
the
lips
of
death
issues
a
wind
that
through
the
stillness
blown
cries
like
a
prophet
ghost
with
wailing
breath
the
weirds
of
finished
and
forgotten
woe
the
song
of
the
stars
from
the
final
reach
of
the
upper
night
to
the
nether
darks
where
the
comets
die
from
the
outmost
bourn
of
the
reigns
of
light
to
the
central
gloom
of
the
midmost
sky
in
our
mazeful
gyres
we
fly
and
our
flight
is
a
choral
chant
of
flame
that
ceaseless
fares
to
the
outer
void
with
the
undersong
of
the
peopled
spheres
the
voices
of
comet
and
asteroid
and
the
wail
of
the
spheres
destroyed
forever
we
sing
to
a
god
unseen
in
the
dark
shall
our
voices
fail
the
void
is
his
robe
inviolate
the
night
is
his
awful
veil
how
our
fires
grow
dim
and
pale
from
the
ordered
gyres
goes
ever
afar
our
song
of
flame
the
void
unknown
where
circles
nor
world
nor
comet
nor
star
shall
it
die
ere
it
reach
his
throne
on
the
shoreless
deeps
of
the
seas
of
gloom
sailing
we
venture
afar
and
wide
where
ever
await
the
tempests
of
doom
where
the
silent
maelstroms
lurk
and
hide
and
the
darkling
reefs
abide
and
the
change
and
ruin
of
stars
is
a
song
that
rises
and
ebbs
in
a
tide
of
fire
a
music
whose
notes
are
of
dreadful
flame
whose
harmonies
ever
leap
where
the
suns
and
the
worlds
expire
is
such
music
not
fit
for
a
god
yet
ever
the
deep
is
a
dark
and
ever
the
night
is
a
void
nor
brightens
a
word
nor
a
mark
to
show
if
our
god
may
hark
from
the
gyres
of
change
goes
ever
afar
our
flaming
chant
the
deep
unknown
the
song
of
the
death
of
planet
and
star
shall
it
die
ere
it
reach
his
throne
in
our
shadows
of
light
the
planets
sweep
and
endure
for
the
span
of
our
prime
globed
atoms
that
hazard
the
termless
deep
with
races
that
bow
to
the
law
of
time
and
yet
cherish
a
dream
sublime
and
they
cry
to
the
god
behind
the
veil
yet
how
should
their
voices
pass
the
night
the
silence
that
waits
in
the
rayless
void
if
he
hear
not
our
music
of
light
and
the
thundrous
song
of
our
might
and
they
strive
in
the
gloom
for
truth
yet
how
should
they
pierce
the
veil
when
we
with
our
splendors
of
flame
in
the
darkness
faint
and
fail
our
fires
how
feeble
and
pale
from
the
ordered
gyres
goes
ever
afar
our
song
of
flame
the
void
unknown
where
circles
nor
world
nor
comet
nor
star
shall
it
die
ere
it
reach
his
throne
copan
around
its
walls
the
forests
of
the
west
gloom
as
about
some
mystery
final
pale
might
lie
its
multifold
exterior
veil
sculptured
with
signs
and
meanings
unconfessed
its
lordly
fanes
and
palaces
attest
a
past
before
whose
wall
of
darkness
fail
reason
and
fancy
finding
not
the
tale
erased
by
time
from
history
palimpsest
within
this
place
that
from
the
gloom
of
eld
still
meets
the
light
a
people
came
and
went
like
whirls
of
dust
between
its
columns
blown
an
alien
race
whose
record
is
sealed
with
those
of
others
long
forespent
that
died
in
sunless
planets
lost
and
lone
a
song
of
dreams
a
voice
came
to
me
from
the
night
and
said
what
profit
hast
thou
in
thy
dreaming
of
the
years
that
are
set
and
the
years
yet
unrisen
hast
thou
found
them
tillable
lands
is
there
fruit
that
thou
canst
pluck
therein
or
any
harvest
to
be
mown
shalt
thou
dig
aught
of
gold
from
the
mines
of
the
past
or
trade
for
merchandise
in
the
years
where
all
is
rotten
are
they
a
sea
that
will
bring
thee
to
any
shore
or
a
desert
that
vergeth
upon
aught
but
the
waste
shalt
thou
drink
from
the
springs
that
are
emptied
or
find
sustenance
in
shadows
what
value
hath
the
future
given
thee
is
there
aught
in
the
days
yet
dark
that
thou
canst
hold
with
thy
hands
are
they
a
fortress
that
will
afford
thee
protection
against
the
swords
of
the
world
is
there
justice
in
them
to
balance
the
world
inequity
or
benefit
to
outweigh
its
loss
then
spake
i
in
answer
saying
of
my
dreams
i
have
made
a
road
and
my
soul
goeth
out
thereon
to
that
unto
which
no
eye
hath
opened
nor
ear
become
keen
to
hearken
to
the
glories
that
are
shut
past
all
access
of
the
keys
of
sense
whose
walls
are
hidden
by
the
air
and
whose
doors
are
concealed
with
clarity
and
the
road
is
travelled
of
secret
things
coming
to
me
from
far
of
bodiless
powers
and
beauties
without
colour
or
form
holden
by
any
loveliness
seen
of
earth
and
of
my
dreams
have
i
builded
an
inn
wherein
these
are
as
guests
and
unto
it
come
the
dead
for
a
little
rest
and
refuge
from
the
hollowness
of
the
unharvestable
wind
and
the
burden
of
too
great
space
the
fields
of
the
past
are
not
void
to
me
who
harvest
with
the
scythe
of
thought
nor
the
orchards
of
future
years
unfruitful
to
the
hands
of
visionings
i
have
retrieved
from
the
darkness
the
years
and
the
things
that
were
lost
and
they
are
held
in
the
light
of
my
dreams
with
the
spirits
of
years
unborn
and
of
things
yet
bodiless
as
in
an
hospitable
house
they
shall
live
while
the
dreams
abide
the
balance
the
world
upheld
their
pillars
for
awhile
now
where
imperial
on
and
memphis
stood
the
hot
wind
sifts
across
the
solitude
the
sand
that
once
was
wall
and
peristyle
or
furrows
like
the
main
each
desert
mile
where
above
its
ancient
food
of
cities
the
waste
is
nude
traceless
as
billows
of
each
sunken
pile
lo
for
that
wrong
shall
vengeance
come
at
last
when
the
devouring
earth
in
ruin
one
with
royal
walls
and
palaces
undone
and
sunk
within
the
desolated
past
shall
drift
and
winds
that
wrangle
through
the
vast
immingle
it
with
ashes
of
the
sun
saturn
now
were
the
titans
gathered
round
their
king
in
a
waste
region
slipping
the
verge
of
drear
extremities
that
clasp
the
world
a
land
by
the
hasty
gods
and
left
beneath
the
bright
scorn
of
the
stars
grotesque
misfeatured
blackly
gnarled
with
stone
or
worn
and
marred
from
conflict
with
the
deep
conterminate
of
chaos
here
they
stood
old
saturn
midmost
like
a
central
peak
among
the
lesser
hills
that
guard
its
base
defeat
that
gloamed
within
each
countenance
like
the
first
tinge
of
death
upon
a
sun
gathering
like
some
dusk
vapor
found
them
cold
clumsy
of
limb
and
halting
as
with
weight
of
threatened
worlds
and
trembling
firmaments
a
wind
cried
round
them
like
a
of
phantom
hosts
hurried
importunate
and
intermittent
with
a
tightening
fear
far
off
the
sunset
leapt
and
the
hard
clouds
molten
among
the
peaks
seemed
furnaces
in
which
to
make
the
fetters
of
the
world
seared
by
the
lightning
of
the
younger
gods
they
saw
beyond
the
grim
and
crouching
hills
those
levins
thrust
like
spears
into
the
heart
of
swollen
clouds
or
tearing
through
the
sky
like
severing
swords
then
as
the
titans
watched
the
night
rose
like
a
black
enormous
mist
around
them
wherein
naught
was
visible
save
the
sharp
levin
leaping
in
the
north
and
no
sound
came
except
of
seas
remote
that
seemed
like
chaos
ravening
past
the
verge
of
all
the
world
fed
with
the
crumbling
coasts
of
matter
till
the
moon
discovering
that
harsh
swart
wilderness
of
sand
and
stone
tissued
and
twisted
in
chaotic
weld
lit
with
illusory
fire
each
titan
form
they
sate
in
silence
mute
as
stranded
orbs
the
wrack
of
time
upcast
on
ruinous
coasts
and
in
the
slow
withdrawal
of
the
tide
safe
for
awhile
small
solace
did
they
take
from
that
frore
radiance
glistering
on
the
dull
black
desert
gripped
in
iron
silences
like
a
false
triumph
contestless
fates
or
a
mirage
of
life
in
wastes
of
death
yet
were
they
moved
to
speak
and
saturn
voice
seeming
the
soul
of
that
tremendous
land
set
free
in
sound
startled
the
haughty
stars
o
titans
gods
sustainers
of
the
world
is
this
the
end
must
earth
go
down
to
chaos
lacking
our
strength
beneath
the
unpracticed
sway
of
godlings
vain
precipitate
with
youth
who
think
unrecking
of
disastrous
chance
to
bind
their
will
as
reins
upon
the
sun
or
stand
as
columns
to
the
ponderous
heavens
must
we
behold
with
eyes
of
impotence
that
universal
wrack
even
though
it
whelm
these
our
usurpers
in
impartial
doom
beneath
the
shards
and
fragments
of
the
world
were
it
not
preferable
to
return
and
meeting
them
in
fight
unswervable
drag
down
the
earth
ourselves
and
these
our
foes
one
sacrifice
unto
the
gods
of
chaos
why
should
we
stay
and
live
the
tragedy
of
power
that
survives
its
use
now
spake
enceladus
when
that
the
echoings
of
saturn
voice
had
fled
remote
and
seemed
dead
thunders
caught
and
flung
from
star
to
star
wouldst
hurl
thy
kingdom
down
the
nightward
gulf
like
to
a
stone
a
curious
child
might
cast
to
test
the
fall
of
some
dark
precipice
patience
and
caution
should
we
take
as
mail
not
rashness
for
a
weapon
too
keen
sword
that
cuts
the
strainèd
knot
of
destiny
to
be
tied
again
were
it
not
best
to
watch
the
slow
procedure
of
the
days
that
we
may
grasp
a
time
more
opportune
when
desperation
is
not
all
our
strength
nor
the
foe
newly
filled
with
victory
then
may
we
hope
to
conquer
back
thy
realm
for
thee
not
for
the
gods
of
nothingness
he
ceased
and
after
him
no
lesser
god
gave
voice
upon
the
shaken
silences
none
venturing
to
risk
comparison
inevitable
then
of
eloquence
with
his
but
silence
like
the
ambiguousness
of
signal
and
of
lesser
stars
and
merged
in
one
confusion
by
the
moon
possessed
that
multitude
till
saturn
rose
around
his
form
the
light
intensified
and
strengthened
with
addition
wild
and
strange
investing
him
as
with
a
phantom
robe
and
gathering
like
a
crown
about
his
brow
his
sword
whereon
the
shadows
lay
like
rust
he
took
and
dipping
it
within
the
moon
made
clean
its
length
of
blade
and
from
it
cast
swift
flickerings
at
the
stars
and
then
his
voice
came
like
a
torrent
and
from
out
his
eyes
streamed
wilder
power
that
mingled
with
the
sound
and
his
resurgent
power
in
glance
and
word
poured
through
the
titans
souls
and
was
become
the
fountains
of
their
own
and
at
his
flame
their
fires
were
lit
once
more
whose
restlessness
leapt
and
aspired
against
the
steadfast
stars
and
now
they
turned
majestic
with
resolve
where
red
upon
the
forefront
of
the
north
arcturus
was
a
beacon
to
the
winds
and
with
the
flickering
winds
that
lightly
struck
the
desert
dust
then
sprang
again
in
air
they
passed
athwart
the
foreland
of
the
north
against
their
march
they
saw
the
shrunken
waste
a
rivelled
region
like
a
world
grown
old
whose
sterile
breast
knew
not
the
lips
of
life
in
all
its
epoch
or
a
world
that
was
the
nurse
of
infant
death
ere
he
became
too
large
too
strong
for
its
restraining
arms
and
towered
athwart
the
suns
and
there
they
crossed
metallic
slopes
that
rang
like
monstrous
shields
but
gave
not
to
their
tread
and
clanging
plains
like
of
greater
vaster
gods
where
hills
made
gibbous
shadows
in
the
moon
they
heard
the
eldritch
laughters
of
the
wind
seeming
the
mirth
of
death
and
their
gaze
gaunt
valleys
deepened
like
an
old
despair
yet
strode
they
on
through
the
moon
fantasies
bold
with
resolve
across
a
land
like
doubt
and
now
they
passed
among
huge
themselves
like
peaks
detached
and
moving
slow
fettered
brethren
adding
weight
and
gloom
to
that
mute
conclave
great
against
the
stars
emerging
thence
the
titans
marched
where
still
their
own
portentous
shadows
went
before
like
night
that
fled
but
shrunk
not
dusking
all
that
desert
way
and
thus
they
came
where
sleep
the
sleep
of
weary
victory
had
seized
the
younger
gods
as
captives
borne
beyond
all
flight
of
mounting
in
that
high
triumph
of
forgetfulness
and
on
that
sleep
the
striding
titans
broke
vague
and
immense
at
first
like
forming
dreams
to
those
disturbèd
gods
in
mist
of
drowse
purblind
and
doubtful
yet
though
soon
they
knew
their
foes
and
rising
stood
in
silent
ranks
expectant
that
appeared
to
move
with
shaking
of
astonished
fires
that
bristled
forth
or
were
displayed
like
plumes
late
folded
close
now
trembling
terribly
pending
between
the
desert
and
the
stars
then
sudden
as
the
waking
from
a
dream
the
battle
leapt
where
striving
shapes
of
gods
moved
brightly
through
the
whirled
and
stricken
air
sweeping
it
to
a
froth
of
fire
and
all
that
ancient
desert
rocked
shaken
as
by
an
onset
of
the
gulfs
of
gathered
and
impatient
chaos
while
above
the
place
where
central
battle
burned
the
stars
drew
back
in
fright
or
dazzlement
paling
to
more
secluded
distances
lo
where
the
moon
had
wrought
illusive
dreams
that
clothed
the
wild
in
doubt
and
fantasy
hiding
its
hideousness
with
bright
mirage
or
deepening
it
with
gulfs
and
glooms
of
hell
mightier
confusion
chaos
absolute
upon
the
imperilled
sky
and
trembling
world
now
made
a
certainty
within
itself
the
one
thing
sure
in
shaken
sky
or
world
maelstroms
of
battle
caught
in
storms
of
fire
torn
and
involved
by
weaponry
of
gods
crescented
blades
that
met
with
rounds
of
shields
grappling
of
shapes
seen
through
the
riven
blaze
an
instant
then
once
more
obscure
and
known
only
by
giant
heavings
of
that
war
of
furious
gods
and
roused
elements
divided
leagued
contending
evermore
along
the
desert
these
augmentative
round
one
thick
center
stunned
the
faltering
night
so
huge
that
chaos
complicate
within
with
movements
of
gigantic
legionry
antagonistic
streams
where
jove
and
saturn
led
in
fight
unswervable
so
wide
the
strife
of
differing
impulse
that
decision
found
no
foothold
till
that
first
confusion
should
in
ordered
conflict
and
stand
with
its
true
forces
known
this
seemed
remote
with
that
wide
struggle
pending
terribly
as
if
colored
time
had
made
a
truce
with
white
eternity
and
both
stood
watching
from
afar
through
drifts
of
haze
the
broadening
moon
made
ominous
with
red
glared
from
the
westering
night
and
now
that
war
built
for
itself
far
up
a
cope
of
cloud
and
drew
it
down
far
off
upon
all
sides
impervious
to
the
moon
and
sworded
stars
and
by
their
own
wild
light
the
gods
fought
on
that
stupendous
concave
like
a
sky
filled
and
illumed
with
glare
of
bursting
suns
and
cast
by
their
own
light
upon
that
sky
the
gods
own
shadows
moved
like
shapen
gloom
phantasmagoric
changed
and
amplified
a
shifting
frieze
that
flickered
dreadfully
in
spectral
battle
indecisive
then
swift
as
it
had
begun
the
contest
turned
and
on
the
heaving
titans
massive
front
it
seemed
that
all
the
motion
and
the
strength
and
confounded
of
that
strife
was
flung
in
centered
impact
terrible
with
rush
of
all
that
fire
as
if
before
some
wind
of
further
space
striking
the
earth
lo
all
the
titans
flame
bent
back
upon
themselves
and
they
were
hurled
in
vaster
disarray
with
vanguard
piled
on
rear
and
center
saturn
could
not
stem
the
loosened
torrents
of
defeat
he
with
his
host
was
but
as
drift
thereon
borne
wildly
down
the
whelmed
and
reeling
world
hurling
like
slanted
rain
the
lurid
levin
fell
that
flight
of
titans
and
behind
in
striding
menace
jove
loomed
like
some
craggy
cloud
with
thunders
crowned
and
footed
with
the
winds
in
that
defeat
with
jove
pursuit
involved
and
manifold
few
found
escape
unscathed
and
some
went
down
like
senile
suns
that
grapple
with
the
dark
and
reel
in
flame
tremendous
and
are
still
ebbing
the
battle
left
those
elder
gods
upcast
once
more
on
coasts
of
black
defeat
gripped
in
despair
a
vaster
tartarus
the
victor
gods
their
storms
and
thunders
spent
went
dwindling
northward
like
embattled
clouds
and
where
the
lingering
haze
of
fight
dissolved
the
pallor
of
the
dawn
began
to
spread
on
darkness
purple
like
the
pain
of
death
ringed
with
that
desolation
saturn
stood
mute
and
the
titans
answered
unto
him
with
brother
silence
motionless
they
seemed
some
peristyle
or
range
of
columns
great
alone
enduring
of
a
fallen
fane
in
deserts
of
some
vaster
world
whence
life
and
faith
have
vanished
long
that
vaguely
slips
to
an
immemoried
end
and
twilight
slow
crept
round
those
lofty
shapes
august
and
seemed
such
as
might
be
the
faltering
ghostly
noon
of
mightier
suns
that
totter
down
to
death
then
turned
they
passing
from
that
dismal
place
blasted
anew
with
battle
ere
the
swift
striding
of
light
athwart
stupendous
chasms
and
wasteful
plains
should
overtake
them
there
bowed
with
too
heavy
a
burden
of
defeat
slowly
they
turned
and
passed
upon
the
west
where
like
a
weariness
immovable
in
menace
huge
the
plain
its
monstrous
bulk
the
peaks
its
hydra
heads
the
whole
world
crouched
against
their
march
with
the
diminished
stars
finis
it
seemed
that
from
the
west
the
live
red
flame
of
sunset
eating
the
dead
blue
sky
and
cold
insensate
peaks
was
loosened
slowly
and
fell
above
it
a
few
red
stars
burned
down
like
low
into
the
gaunt
black
sockets
of
the
chill
insensible
mountains
but
in
the
ascendant
skies
cloudless
like
some
vast
corpse
unfeatured
cerementless
succeeded
nor
star
nor
planet
it
may
have
been
that
black
pulseless
dead
stars
arose
and
crossed
as
of
old
the
heavens
but
came
no
living
orb
nor
comet
seeming
the
ghost
homeless
of
an
outcast
world
seeking
its
former
place
that
is
no
more
nor
shall
be
in
all
the
cosmos
again
null
blank
and
meaningless
as
a
burnt
scroll
that
blackens
with
the
passing
of
the
fire
lay
the
dead
infinite
sky
lo
in
the
halls
of
time
i
thought
the
torches
are
out
the
revelry
of
the
gods
or
lamentation
of
demons
for
which
their
flames
were
lit
over
and
quiet
at
last
with
the
closing
peace
of
night
whose
dumb
dead
passionless
skies
enfold
the
living
world
as
the
sea
a
sinking
pebble
