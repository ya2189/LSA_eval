song
through

streets
o
city
a
march
in
the
ranks
and
the
road
unknown
a
march
in
the
ranks
and
the
road
unknown
a
route
through
a
heavy
wood
with
muffled
steps
in
the
darkness
our
army
foil
with
loss
severe
and
the
sullen
remnant
retreating
till
after
midnight
glimmer
upon
us
the
lights
of
a
building
we
come
to
an
open
space
in
the
woods
and
halt
by
the
building
is
a
large
old
church
at
the
crossing
roads
now
an
impromptu
hospital
entering
but
for
a
minute
i
see
a
sight
beyond
all
the
pictures
and
poems
ever
made
shadows
of
deepest
deepest
black
just
lit
by
moving
candles
and
lamps
and
by
one
great
pitchy
torch
stationary
with
wild
red
flame
and
clouds
of
smoke
by
these
crowds
groups
of
forms
vaguely
i
see
on
the
floor
some
in
the
pews
laid
down
at
my
feet
more
distinctly
a
soldier
a
mere
lad
in
danger
of
bleeding
to
death
he
is
shot
in
the
abdomen
i
stanch
the
blood
temporarily
the
youngster
face
is
white
as
a
lily
then
before
i
depart
i
sweep
my
eyes
the
scene
fain
to
absorb
it
all
faces
varieties
postures
beyond
description
most
in
obscurity
some
of
them
dead
surgeons
operating
attendants
holding
lights
the
smell
of
ether
the
odour
of
blood
the
crowd
o
the
crowd
of
the
bloody
forms
the
yard
outside
also
fill
some
on
the
bare
ground
some
on
planks
or
stretchers
some
in
the
sweating
an
occasional
scream
or
cry
the
doctor
shouted
orders
or
calls
the
glisten
of
the
little
steel
instruments
catching
the
glint
of
the
torches
these
i
resume
as
i
chant
i
see
again
the
forms
i
smell
the
odour
then
hear
outside
the
orders
given
in
my
men
fall
but
first
i
bend
to
the
dying
lad
his
eyes
open
a
gives
he
me
then
the
eyes
close
calmly
close
and
i
speed
forth
to
the
darkness
resuming
marching
ever
in
darkness
marching
on
in
the
ranks
the
unknown
road
still
marching
come
up
from
the
fields
father
come
up
from
the
fields
father
here
a
letter
from
our
pete
and
come
to
the
front
door
mother
here
a
letter
from
thy
dear
son
lo
is
autumn
lo
where
the
trees
deeper
green
yellower
and
redder
cool
and
sweeten
ohio
villages
with
leaves
fluttering
in
the
moderate
wind
where
apples
ripe
in
the
orchards
hang
and
grapes
on
the
vines
smell
you
the
smell
of
the
grapes
on
the
vines
smell
you
the
buckwheat
where
the
bees
were
lately
buzzing
above
all
lo
the
sky
so
calm
so
transparent
after
the
rain
and
with
wondrous
clouds
below
too
all
calm
all
vital
and
beautiful
and
the
farm
prospers
well
down
in
the
fields
all
prospers
well
but
now
from
the
fields
come
father
come
at
the
daughter
call
and
come
to
the
entry
mother
to
the
front
door
come
right
away
fast
as
she
can
she
hurries
something
ominous
her
steps
trembling
she
does
not
tarry
to
smooth
her
hair
nor
adjust
her
cap
open
the
envelope
quickly
o
this
is
not
our
son
writing
yet
his
name
is
sign
o
a
strange
hand
writes
for
our
dear
son
o
stricken
mother
soul
all
swims
before
her
eyes
flashes
with
black
she
catches
the
main
words
only
sentences
broken
wound
in
the
breast
cavalry
skirmish
taken
to
hospital
at
present
low
but
will
soon
be
ah
now
the
single
figure
to
me
amid
all
teeming
and
wealthy
ohio
with
all
its
cities
and
farms
sickly
white
in
the
face
and
dull
in
the
head
very
faint
by
the
jamb
of
a
door
leans
not
so
dear
the
daughter
speaks
through
her
sobs
the
little
sisters
huddle
around
speechless
and
dismay
dearest
mother
the
letter
says
pete
will
soon
be
alas
poor
boy
he
will
never
be
better
nor
may
be
needs
to
be
better
that
brave
and
simple
soul
while
they
stand
at
home
at
the
door
he
is
dead
already
the
only
son
is
dead
but
the
mother
needs
to
be
better
she
with
thin
form
presently
drest
in
black
by
day
her
meals
untouch
then
at
night
fitfully
sleeping
often
waking
in
the
midnight
waking
weeping
longing
with
one
deep
longing
o
that
she
might
withdraw
unnoticed
silent
from
life
escape
and
withdraw
to
follow
to
seek
to
be
with
her
dear
dead
son
a
twilight
song
as
i
sit
in
twilight
late
alone
by
the
flickering
musing
on
of
the
countless
buried
unknown
soldiers
of
the
vacant
names
as
unindented
air
and
sea
the
unreturn
the
brief
truce
after
battle
with
grim
and
the
trenches
of
gather
dead
from
all
america
north
south
east
west
whence
they
came
up
from
wooded
maine
farms
from
fertile
pennsylvania
illinois
ohio
from
the
measureless
west
virginia
the
south
the
carolinas
texas
even
here
in
my
and
in
the
noiseless
flickering
flames
again
i
see
the
stalwart
ranks
rising
i
hear
the
rhythmic
tramp
of
the
armies
you
million
unwrit
names
all
all
you
dark
bequest
from
all
the
war
a
special
verse
for
you
a
flash
of
duty
long
neglected
your
mystic
roll
strangely
gather
here
each
name
recall
by
me
from
out
the
darkness
and
death
ashes
henceforth
to
be
deep
deep
within
my
heart
recording
for
many
a
future
year
your
mystic
roll
entire
of
unknown
names
or
north
or
south
embalm
with
love
in
this
twilight
song
a
sight
in
camp
in
the
daybreak
gray
and
dim
a
sight
in
camp
in
the
daybreak
gray
and
dim
as
from
my
tent
i
emerge
so
early
sleepless
as
slow
i
walk
in
the
cool
fresh
air
the
path
near
by
the
hospital
tent
three
forms
i
see
on
stretchers
lying
brought
out
there
untended
lying
over
each
the
blanket
spread
ample
brownish
woollen
blanket
gray
and
heavy
blanket
folding
covering
all
curious
i
halt
and
silent
stand
then
with
light
fingers
i
from
the
face
of
the
nearest
the
first
just
lift
the
blanket
who
are
you
elderly
man
so
gaunt
and
grim
with
hair
and
flesh
all
sunken
about
the
eyes
who
are
you
my
dear
comrade
then
to
the
second
i
step
and
who
are
you
my
child
and
darling
who
are
you
sweet
boy
with
cheeks
yet
blooming
then
to
the
third
a
face
nor
child
nor
old
very
calm
as
of
beautiful
ivory
young
man
i
think
i
know
you
i
think
this
face
is
the
face
of
the
christ
himself
dead
and
divine
and
brother
of
all
and
here
again
he
lies
year
that
trembled
and
reel
beneath
me
year
that
trembled
and
reel
beneath
me
your
summer
wind
was
warm
enough
yet
the
air
i
breathed
froze
me
a
thick
gloom
fell
through
the
sunshine
and
darken
me
must
i
change
my
triumphant
songs
said
i
to
myself
must
i
indeed
learn
to
chant
the
cold
dirges
of
the
baffled
and
sullen
hymns
of
defeat
first
o
songs
for
a
prelude
first
o
songs
for
a
prelude
lightly
strike
on
the
stretch
tympanum
pride
and
joy
in
my
city
how
she
led
the
rest
to
arms
how
she
gave
the
cue
how
at
once
with
lithe
limbs
unwaiting
a
moment
she
sprang
o
superb
o
manhattan
my
own
my
peerless
o
strongest
you
in
the
hour
of
danger
in
crisis
o
truer
than
steel
how
you
sprang
how
you
threw
off
the
costumes
of
peace
with
indifferent
hand
how
your
soft
changed
and
the
drum
and
fife
were
heard
in
their
stead
how
you
led
to
the
war
that
shall
serve
for
our
prelude
songs
of
soldiers
how
manhattan
led
forty
years
had
i
in
my
city
seen
soldiers
parading
forty
years
as
a
pageant
till
unawares
the
lady
of
this
teeming
and
turbulent
city
sleepless
amid
her
ships
her
houses
her
incalculable
wealth
with
her
million
children
around
her
suddenly
at
dead
of
night
at
news
from

south
incens
struck
with

pavement
a
shock
electric

it
till
with
ominous
hum
our
hive
at
daybreak
pour
out
its
myriads
from
the
houses
then
and
the
workshops
and
through
all
the
doorways
leapt
they
tumultuous
and
lo
manhattan
arming
to

young
men
falling
in
and
arming

ships
you
mannahatta
old
matron
of
this
proud
friendly
turbulent
city
often
in
peace
and
wealth
you
were
pensive
or
covertly
frown
amid
all
your
children
but
now
you
smile
with
joy
exulting
old
mannahatta
song
of
the
banner
at
daybreak
o
a
new
song
a
free
song
flapping
flapping
flapping
flapping
by
sounds
by
voices
clearer
by
the
wind
voice
and
that
of
the
drum
by
the
banner
voice
and
the
child
voice
and
sea
voice
and
father
voice
low
on
the
ground
and
high
in
the
air
on
the
ground
where
father
and
child
stand
in
the
upward
air
where
their
eyes
turn
where
the
banner
at
daybreak
is
flapping
words
what
are
you
words
no
more
for
hearken
and
see
my
song
is
there
in
the
open
air
and
i
must
sing
with
the
banner
and
pennant
i
weave
the
chord
and
twine
in
man

and
babe

i
twine
them
in
i
put
in
life
i
put
the
bayonet
flashing
point
i
let
bullets
and
slugs
whizz
as
one
carrying
a
symbol
and
menace
far
into
the
future
crying
with
trumpet
voice
and

and

i

the
verse
with
streams
of
blood
full
of
volition
full
of
joy

to

and
compete
with
the
banner
and
pennant
come
up
here
bard
bard
come
up
here
soul
soul
come
up
here
dear
little
child
to
fly
in
the
clouds
and
winds
with
me
and
play
with
the
measureless
light
father
what
is
that
in
the
sky
beckoning
to
me
with
long
finger
and
what
does
it
say
to
me
all
the
while
nothing
my
babe
you
see
in
the
sky
and
nothing
at
all
to
you
it
says
but
look
you
my
babe
look
at
these
dazzling
things
in
the
houses
and
see
you
the
opening
and
see
you
the
vehicles
preparing
to
crawl
along
the
streets
with
goods
these
ah
these
how
valued
and
toil
for
these
how
envied
by
all
the
earth
fresh
and
rosy
red
the
sun
is
mounting
high
on
floats
the
sea
in
distant
blue
careering
through
its
channels
on
floats
the
wind
over
the
breast
of
the
sea
setting
in
toward
land
the
great
steady
wind
from
west
to
floating
so
buoyant
with
foam
on
the
waters
but
i
am
not
the
sea
nor
the
red
sun
i
am
not
the
wind
with
girlish
laughter
not
the
immense
wind
which
strengthens
not
the
wind
which
lashes
not
the
spirit
that
ever
lashes
its
own
body
to
terror
and
death
but
i
am
that
which
unseen
comes
and
sings
sings
sings
which
babbles
in
brooks
and
scoots
in
showers
on
the
land
which
the
birds
know
in
the
woods
mornings
and
evenings
and
the
know
and
the
hissing
wave
and
that
banner
and
pennant
aloft
there
flapping
and
flapping
o
father
it
is
alive
it
is
full
of
people
it
has
children
o
now
it
seems
to
me
it
is
talking
to
its
children
i
hear
it
it
talks
to
me
o
it
is
wonderful
o
it
stretches
it
spreads
and
runs
so
fast
o
my
father
it
is
so
broad
it
covers
the
whole
sky
cease
cease
my
foolish
babe
what
you
are
saying
is
sorrowful
to
me
much
it
displeases
me
behold
with
the
rest
again
i
say
behold
not
banners
and
pennants
aloft
but
the
pavements
behold
and
mark
the
houses
and
speak
to
the
child
o
bard
out
of
manhattan
to
our
children
all
or
north
or
south
of
manhattan
point
this
day
leaving
all
the
rest
to
us
over
all
and
yet
we
know
not
why
for
what
are
we
mere
strips
of
cloth
profiting
nothing
only
flapping
in
the
wind
i
hear
and
see
not
strips
of
cloth
alone
i
hear
the
tramp
of
armies
i
hear
the
challenging
sentry
i
hear
the
jubilant
shouts
of
millions
of
men
i
hear
liberty
i
hear
the
drums
beat
and
the
trumpets
blowing
i
myself
move
abroad
flying
then
i
use
the
wings
of
the
and
use
the
wings
of
the
and
look
down
as
from
a
height
i
do
not
deny
the
precious
results
of
peace
i
see
populous
cities
with
wealth
incalculable
i
see
numberless
farms
i
see
the
farmers
working
in
their
fields
or
barns
i
see
mechanics
working
i
see
buildings
everywhere
founded
going
up
or
finish
i
see
trains
of
cars
swiftly
speeding
along
railroad
tracks
drawn
by
the
locomotives
i
see
the
stores
depots
of
boston
baltimore
charleston
new
orleans
i
see
far
in
the
west
the
immense
area
of
grain
i
dwell
awhile
hovering
i
pass
to
the
lumber
forests
of
the
north
and
again
to
the
southern
plantation
and
again
to
california
sweeping
the
whole
i
see
the
countless
profit
the
busy
gatherings
earn
wages
see
the
identity
formed
out
of
spacious
and
haughty
states
and
many
more
to
come
see
forts
on
the
shores
of
harbours
see
ships
sailing
in
and
out
then
over
all
aye
aye
my
little
and
lengthen
pennant
shaped
like
a
sword
runs
swiftly
up
indicating
war
and
defiance
and
now
the
halyards
have
rais
it
side
of
my
banner
broad
and
blue
side
of
my
starry
banner
discarding
peace
over
all
the
sea
and
land
and
yet
louder
higher
stronger
bard
yet
farther
wider
cleave
no
longer
let
our
children
deem
us
riches
and
peace
alone
we
may
be
terror
and
carnage
and
are
so
now
not
now
are
we
any
one
of
these
spacious
and
haughty
states
nor
any
five
nor
ten
nor
market
nor
depot
we
nor
in
the
city
but
these
and
all
and
the
brown
and
spreading
land
and
the
mines
below
are
ours
and
the
shores
of
the
sea
are
ours
and
the
rivers
great
and
small
and
the
fields
they
moisten
and
the
crops
and
the
fruits
are
ours
bays
and
channels
and
ships
sailing
in
and
out
are
ours
while
we
over
all
over
the
area
spread
below
the
three
or
four
millions
of
square
miles
the
capitals
the
forty
millions
of
people
o
bard
in
life
and
death
supreme
we
even
we
henceforth
flaunt
out
masterful
high
up
above
not
for
the
present
alone
for
a
thousand
years
chanting
through
you
this
song
to
the
soul
of
one
poor
little
child
o
my
father
i
like
not
the
houses
they
will
never
to
me
be
anything
nor
do
i
like
money
but
to
mount
up
there
i
would
like
o
father
dear
that
banner
i
like
that
pennant
i
would
be
and
must
be
child
of
mine
you
fill
me
with
anguish
to
be
that
pennant
would
be
too
fearful
little
you
know
what
it
is
this
day
and
after
this
day
forever
it
is
to
gain
nothing
but
risk
and
defy
everything
forward
to
stand
in
front
of
wars
and
o
such
wars
what
have
you
to
do
with
them
with
passions
of
demons
slaughter
premature
death
demons
and
death
then
i
sing
put
in
all
aye
all
will
i
pennant
for
war
and
a
pleasure
new
and
ecstatic
and
the
prattled
yearning
of
children
blent
with
the
sounds
of
the
peaceful
land
and
the
liquid
wash
of
the
sea
and
the
black
ships
fighting
on
the
sea
envelop
in
smoke
and
the
icy
cool
of
the
far
far
north
with
rustling
cedars
and
pines
and
the
whirr
of
drums
and
the
sound
of
soldiers
marching
and
the
hot
sun
shining
south
and
the
combing
over
the
beach
on
my
eastern
shore
and
my
western
shore
the
same
and
all
between
those
shores
and
my
ever
running
mississippi
with
bends
and
chutes
and
my
illinois
fields
and
my
kansas
fields
and
my
fields
of
missouri
the
continent
devoting
the
whole
identity
without
reserving
an
atom
pour
in
whelm
that
which
asks
which
sings
with
all
and
the
yield
of
all
fusing
and
holding
claiming
devouring
the
whole
no
more
with
tender
lip
nor
musical
labial
sound
but
out
of
the
night
emerging
for
food
our
voice
persuasive
no
more
croaking
like
crows
here
in
the
wind
my
limbs
my
veins
dilate
my
theme
is
clear
at
last
banner
so
broad
advancing
out
of
the
night
i
sing
you
haughty
and
resolute
i
burst
through
where
i
waited
long
too
long
deafen
and
blinded
my
hearing
and
tongue
are
come
to
me
a
little
child
taught
me
i
hear
from
above
o
pennant
of
war
your
ironical
call
and
demand
insensate
insensate
yet
i
at
any
rate
chant
you
o
banner
not
houses
of
peace
indeed
are
you
nor
any
nor
all
their
prosperity
if
need
be
you
shall
again
have
every
one
of
those
houses
to
destroy
them
you
thought
not
to
destroy
those
valuable
houses
standing
fast
full
of
comfort
built
with
money
may
they
stand
fast
then
not
an
hour
except
you
above
them
and
all
stand
fast
o
banner
not
money
so
precious
are
you
not
farm
produce
you
nor
the
material
good
nutriment
nor
excellent
stores
nor
landed
on
wharves
from
the
ships
not
the
superb
ships
with
or
fetching
and
carrying
cargoes
nor
machinery
vehicles
trade
nor
revenues
but
you
as
henceforth
i
see
you
running
up
out
of
the
night
bringing
your
cluster
of
stars
stars
divider
of
daybreak
you
cutting
the
air
touch
by
the
sun
measuring
the
sky
passionately
seen
and
yearn
for
by
one
poor
little
child
while
others
remain
busy
or
smartly
talking
forever
teaching
thrift
thrift
o
you
up
there
o
pennant
where
you
undulate
like
a
snake
hissing
so
curious
out
of
reach
an
idea
only
yet
furiously
fought
for
risking
bloody
death
loved
by
me
so
loved
o
you
banner
leading
the
day
with
stars
brought
from
the
night
valueless
object
of
eyes
over
all
and
demanding
all
absolute
owner
of
all
o
banner
and
pennant
i
too
leave
the
rest
great
as
it
is
it
is
nothing
houses
machines
are
nothing
i
see
them
not
i
see
but
you
o
warlike
pennant
o
banner
so
broad
with
stripes
i
sing
you
only
flapping
up
there
in
the
wind
the
dying
veteran
long
island
incident
early
part
of
the
nineteenth
amid
these
days
of
order
ease
prosperity
amid
the
current
songs
of
beauty
peace
decorum
i
cast
a
reminiscence
likely
will
offend
you
i
heard
it
in
my
boyhood
more
than
a
generation
since
a
queer
old
savage
man
a
fighter
under
washington
himself
large
brave
cleanly
no
talker
rather
spiritualistic
had
fought
in
the
ranks
fought
well
had
been
all
through
the
revolutionary
war
lay
dying
sons
daughters
lovingly
tending
him
sharping
their
sense
their
ears
towards
his
murmuring
words
let
me
return
again
to
my
to
the
sights
and
scenes
to
forming
the
line
of
battle
to
the
scouts
ahead
reconnoitering
to
the
cannons
the
grim
artillery
to
the
galloping
aids
carrying
orders
to
the
wounded
the
fallen
the
heat
the
suspense
the
perfume
strong
the
smoke
the
deafening
noise
away
with
your
life
of
peace
your
joys
of
peace
give
me
my
old
wild
again
the
an
old
man
bending
i
come
among
new
faces
years
looking
backward
resuming
in
answer
to
children
come
tell
us
old
man
as
from
young
men
and
maidens
that
love
me
arous
and
angry
i
thought
to
beat
the
alarum
and
urge
relentless
war
but
soon
my
fingers
fail
me
my
face
droop
and
i
resign
myself
to
sit
by
the
wounded
and
soothe
them
or
silently
watch
the
dead
years
hence
of
these
scenes
of
these
furious
passions
these
chances
of
unsurpass
heroes
was
one
side
so
brave
the
other
was
equally
brave
now
be
witness
again
paint
the
mightiest
armies
of
earth
of
those
armies
so
rapid
so
wondrous
what
saw
you
to
tell
us
what
stays
with
you
latest
and
deepest
of
curious
panics
of
engagements
or
sieges
tremendous
what
deepest
remains
o
maidens
and
young
men
i
love
and
that
love
me
what
you
ask
of
my
days
those
the
strangest
and
sudden
your
talking
recalls
soldier
alert
i
arrive
after
a
long
march
cover
with
sweat
and
dust
in
the
nick
of
time
i
come
plunge
in
the
fight
loudly
shout
in
the
rush
of
successful
charge
enter
the
captur
works
yet
lo
like
a
river
they
fade
pass
and
are
gone
they
fade
i
dwell
not
on
soldiers
perils
or
soldiers
joys
both
i
remember
well
many
the
hardships
few
the
joys
yet
i
was
content
but
in
silence
in
dreams
projections
while
the
world
of
gain
and
appearance
and
mirth
goes
on
so
soon
what
is
over
forgotten
and
waves
wash
the
imprints
off
the
sand
with
hinged
knees
returning
i
enter
the
doors
while
for
you
up
there
whoever
you
are
follow
without
noise
and
be
of
strong
heart
bearing
the
bandages
water
and
sponge
straight
and
swift
to
my
wounded
i
go
where
they
lie
on
the
ground
after
the
battle
brought
in
where
their
priceless
blood
reddens
the
grass
the
ground
or
to
the
rows
of
the
hospital
tent
or
under
the
roof
hospital
to
the
long
rows
of
cots
up
and
down
each
side
i
return
to
each
and
all
one
after
another
i
draw
near
not
one
do
i
miss
an
attendant
follows
holding
a
tray
he
carries
a
refuse
pail
soon
to
be
fill
with
clotted
rags
and
blood
emptied
and
again
i
onward
go
i
stop
with
hinged
knees
and
steady
hand
to
dress
wounds
i
am
firm
with
each
the
pangs
are
sharp
yet
unavoidable
one
turns
to
me
his
appealing
eyes
poor
boy
i
never
knew
you
yet
i
think
i
could
not
refuse
this
moment
to
die
for
you
if
that
would
save
you
on
on
i
go
open
doors
of
time
open
hospital
doors
the
crush
head
i
dress
poor
crazed
hand
tear
not
the
bandage
away
the
neck
of
the
with
the
bullet
through
and
through
i
examine
hard
the
breathing
rattles
quite
glazed
already
the
eye
yet
life
struggles
hard
come
sweet
death
be
persuaded
o
beautiful
death
in
mercy
come
quickly
from
the
stump
of
the
arm
the
amputated
hand
i
undo
the
clotted
lint
remove
the
slough
wash
off
the
matter
and
blood
back
on
his
pillow
the
soldier
bends
with
curv
neck
and
head
his
eyes
are
closed
his
face
is
pale
he
dares
not
look
on
the
bloody
stump
and
has
not
yet
look
on
it
i
dress
a
wound
in
the
side
deep
deep
but
a
day
or
two
more
for
see
the
frame
all
wasted
and
sinking
and
the
countenance
see
i
dress
the
perforated
shoulder
the
foot
with
the
cleanse
the
one
with
a
gnawing
and
putrid
gangrene
so
sickening
so
offensive
while
the
attendant
stands
behind
aside
me
holding
the
tray
and
pail
i
am
faithful
i
do
not
give
out
the
fractur
thigh
the
knee
the
wound
in
the
abdomen
these
and
more
i
dress
with
impassive
hand
yet
deep
in
my
breast
a
fire
a
burning
flame
thus
in
silence
in
dreams
projections
returning
resuming
i
thread
my
way
through
the
hospitals
the
hurt
and
wounded
i
pacify
with
soothing
hand
i
sit
by
the
restless
all
the
dark
night
some
are
so
young
some
suffer
so
much
i
recall
the
experience
sweet
and
sad
many
a
soldier
loving
arms
about
this
neck
have
cross
and
rested
many
a
soldier
kiss
dwells
on
these
bearded
lips
dirge
for
two
veterans
the
last
sunbeam
lightly
falls
from
the
finish
sabbath
on
the
pavement
here
and
there
beyond
it
is
looking
down
a
double
grave
lo
the
moon
ascending
up
from
the
east
the
silvery
round
moon
beautiful
over
the
ghastly
phantom
moon
immense
and
silent
moon
i
see
a
sad
procession
and
i
hear
the
sound
of
coming
bugles
all
the
channels
of
the
city
streets
they
flooding
as
with
voices
and
with
tears
i
hear
the
great
drums
pounding
and
the
small
drums
steady
whirring
and
every
blow
of
the
great
convulsive
drums
strikes
me
through
and
through
for
the
son
is
brought
with
the
father
in
the
foremost
ranks
of
the
fierce
assault
they
fell
two
veterans
son
and
father
dropt
together
and
the
double
grave
awaits
them
now
nearer
blow
the
bugles
and
the
drums
strike
more
convulsive
and
the
daylight
over
the
pavement
quite
has
faded
and
the
strong
enwraps
me
in
the
eastern
sky
the
sorrowful
vast
phantom
moves
is
some
mother
large
transparent
face
in
heaven
brighter
growing
o
strong
you
please
me
o
moon
immense
with
your
silvery
face
you
soothe
me
o
my
soldiers
twain
o
my
veterans
passing
to
burial
what
i
have
i
also
give
you
the
moon
gives
you
light
and
the
bugles
and
the
drums
give
you
music
and
my
heart
o
my
soldiers
my

my
heart
gives
you
love
from

dakota
cañons
from
far
dakota
cañons
lands
of
the
wild
ravine
the
dusky
sioux
the
lonesome
stretch
the
silence
haply
a
mournful
wail
haply
a
for
heroes
the
the
indian
ambuscade
the
craft
the
fatal
environment
the
cavalry
companies
fighting
to
the
last
in
sternest
heroism
in
the
midst
of
their
little
circle
with
their
slaughter
horses
for
breastworks
the
fall
of
custer
and
all
his
officers
and

continues
yet
the
old
old
legend
of
our
race
the
loftiest
of
life
upheld
by
death
the
ancient
banner
perfectly
maintain
o
lesson
opportune
o
how
i
welcome
thee
as
sitting
in
dark
days
lone
sulky
through
the
time
thick
murk
looking
in
vain
for
light
for
hope
from
unsuspected
parts
a
fierce
and
momentary
proof
the
sun
there
at
the
centre
though
conceal
electric
life
forever
at
the
centre
breaks
forth
a
lightning
flash
thou
of
the
tawny
flowing
hair
in
battle
i
erewhile
saw
with
erect
head
pressing
ever
in
front
bearing
a
bright
sword
in
thy
hand
now
ending
well
in
death
the
splendid
fever
of
thy
deeds
i
bring
no
dirge
for
it
or
thee
i
bring
a
glad
triumphal
sonnet
desperate
and
glorious
aye
in
defeat
most
desperate
most
glorious
after
thy
many
battles
in
which
never
yielding
up
a
gun
or
a
colour
leaving
behind
thee
a
memory
sweet
to
soldiers
thou
yieldest
up
thyself
old
in
midnight
sleep
of
many
a
face
of
anguish
of
the
look
at
first
of
the
mortally
wounded
of
that
indescribable
look
of
the
dead
on
their
backs
with
arms
extended
wide
i
dream
i
dream
i
dream
of
scenes
of
nature
fields
and
mountains
of
skies
so
beauteous
after
a
storm
and
at
night
the
moon
so
unearthly
bright
shining
sweetly
shining
down
where
we
dig
the
trenches
and
gather
the
heaps
i
dream
i
dream
i
dream
long
have
they
pass
faces
and
trenches
and
fields
where
through
the
carnage
i
moved
with
a
callous
composure
or
away
from
the
fallen
onward
i
sped
at
the
time
but
now
of
their
forms
at
night
i
dream
i
dream
i
dream
delicate
cluster
delicate
cluster
flag
of
teeming
life
covering
all
my
lands
all
my
seashores
lining
flag
of
death
how
i
watch
you
through
the
smoke
of
battle
pressing
how
i
heard
you
flap
and
rustle
cloth
defiant
flag
cerulean
sunny
flag
with
the
orbs
of
night
dappled
ah
my
silvery
beauty
ah
my
woolly
white
and
crimson
ah
to
sing
the
song
of
you
my
matron
mighty
my
sacred
one
my
mother
to
a
certain
civilian
did
you
ask
dulcet
rhymes
from
me
did
you
seek
the
civilian
peaceful
and
languishing
rhymes
did
you
find
what
i
sang
erewhile
so
hard
to
follow
why
i
was
not
singing
erewhile
for
you
to
follow
to
understand
nor
am
i
now
i
have
been
born
of
the
same
as
the
war
was
born
the
rattle
is
ever
to
me
sweet
music
i
love
well
the
martial
dirge
with
slow
wail
and
convulsive
throb
leading
the
officer
funeral
what
to
such
as
you
anyhow
such
a
poet
as
i
therefore
leave
my
works
and
go
lull
yourself
with
what
you
can
understand
and
with
for
i
lull
nobody
and
you
will
never
understand
me

of
gloomiest
fears
and
doubts
yet
onward
ever
unfaltering
pressing
spirit
of
many
a
solemn
day
and
many
a
savage
scene
electric
spirit
that
with
muttering
voice
through
the
war
now
closed
like
a
tireless
phantom
flitted
rousing
the
land
with
breath
of
flame
while
you
beat
and
beat
the
drum
now
as
the
sound
of
the
drum
hollow
and
harsh
to
the
last
reverberates
round
me
as
your
ranks
your
immortal
ranks
return
return
from
the
battles
as
the
muskets
of
the
young
men
yet
lean
over
their
shoulders
as
i
look
on
the
bayonets
bristling
over
their
shoulders
as
those
slanted
bayonets
whole
forests
of
them
appearing
in
the
distance
approach
and
pass
on
returning
homeward
moving
with
steady
motion
swaying
to
and
fro
to
the
right
and

evenly
lightly
rising
and
falling

the

keep

pale
as

next

touch
my

ere
you
depart
press
my

close

me
your
pulses
of
rage
bequeath
them
to
me
fill
me
with
currents
convulsive
let
them
scorch
and
blister
out
of
my
chants
when
you
are
gone
let
them
identify
you
to
the
future
in
these
songs
the
return
of
the
heroes
for
the
lands
and
for
these
passionate
days
and
for
myself
now
i
awhile
retire
to
thee
o
soil
of
autumn
fields
reclining
on
thy

giving
myself
to
thee
answering
the
pulses
of
thy
sane
and
equable
heart
tuning
a
verse
for
thee
o
earth
that
hast
no

confide
to
me
a
voice
o
harvest
of
my
lands
o
boundless
summer

o

when
late
i
sang
sad
was
my
voice
sad
were
the
shows
around
me
with
deafening
noises
of
hatred
and
smoke
of
war
in
the
midst
of
the
conflict
the
heroes
i
stood
or
pass
with
slow
step
through
the
wounded
and
dying
but
now
i
sing
not
war
nor
the
measur
march
of
soldiers
nor
the
tents
of
camps
nor
the
regiments
hastily
coming
up
deploying
in
line
of
battle
no
more
the
sad
unnatural
shows
of
war
ask
room
those
flush
immortal
ranks
the
first
armies
ask
room
alas
the
ghastly
ranks
the
armies
dread
that
follow
pass
pass
ye
proud
brigades
with
your
tramping
sinewy
legs
with
your
shoulders
young
and
strong
with
your
knapsacks
and
your
muskets
how
elate
i
stood
and
watch
you
where
starting
off
you
march
pass
then
rattle
drums
again
for
an
army
heaves
in
sight
o
another
gathering
army
swarming
trailing
on
the
rear
o
you
dread
accruing
army
o
you
regiments
so
piteous
with
your
mortal
diarrhoea
with
your
fever
o
my
land
maim
darlings
with
the
plenteous
bloody
bandage
and
the
crutch
lo
your
pallid
army
follows
but
on
these
days
of
brightness
on
the
beauteous
landscape
the
roads
and
lanes
the
and
the
fruits
and
barns
should
the
dead
intrude
ah
the
dead
to
me
mar
not
they
fit
well
in
nature
they
fit
very
well
in
the
landscape
under
the
trees
and
grass
and
along
the
edge
of
the
sky
in
the
horizon
far
margin
nor
do
i
forget
you
departed
nor
in
winter
or
summer
my
lost
ones
but
most
in
the
open
air
as
now
when
my
soul
is
rapt
and
at
peace
like
pleasing
phantoms
your
memories
rising
glide
silently
by
me
i
saw
the
day
the
return
of
the
heroes
yet
the
heroes
never
surpass
shall
never
return
them
that
day
i
saw
not
i
saw
the
interminable
corps
i
saw
the
processions
of
armies
i
saw
them
approaching
defiling
by
with
divisions
streaming
northward
their
work
done
camping
awhile
in
clusters
of
mighty
camps
no
holiday
soldiers
youthful
yet
veterans

swart
handsome

of
the
stock
of
homestead
and

of
many
a
long

and
sweaty
march
inured
on
many
a
bloody
field
a
pause
the
armies
wait
a
million
flush
embattled
conquerors
wait
the
world
too
waits
then
soft
as
breaking
night
and
sure
as
dawn
they
melt
they
disappear
exult
o
lands
victorious
lands
not
there
your
victory
on
those
red
shuddering
fields
but
here
and
hence
your
victory

melt
away
ye

disperse
ye

where
the

free
my
soul
in
the
dooryard
fronting
an
old
near
the
palings
stands
the
with
leaves
of
rich
green
with
many
a
pointed
blossom
rising
delicate
with
the
perfume
strong
i
love
with
every
leaf
a
miracle
and
from
this
bush
in
the
with
blossoms
and
leaves
of
rich
green
a
sprig
with
its
flower
i
break
in
the
swamp
in
secluded
recesses
a
shy
and
hidden
bird
is
warbling
a
song
solitary
the
thrush
the
hermit
withdrawn
to
himself
avoiding
the
settlements
sings
by
himself
a
song
song
of
the
bleeding
throat
death
outlet
song
of
life
for
well
dear
brother
i
know
if
thou
wast
not
granted
to
sing
thou
surely
die
over
the
breast
of
the
spring
the
land
amid
cities
amid
lanes
and
through
old
woods
where
lately
the
violets
from
the
ground
spotting
the
gray
débris
amid
the
grass
in
the
fields
each
side
of
the
lanes
passing
the
endless
grass
passing
the
wheat
every
grain
from
its
shroud
in
the
fields
uprisen
passing
the
blows
of
white
and
pink
in
the
orchards
carrying
a
corpse
to
where
it
shall
rest
in
the
grave
night
and
day
journeys
a
coffin
coffin
that
passes
through
lanes
and
streets
through
day
and
night
with
the
great
cloud
darkening
the
land
with
the
pomp
of
the
inloop
flags
with
the
cities
draped
in
black
with
the
show
of
the
states
themselves
as
of
women
standing
with
processions
long
and
winding
and
the
flambeaus
of
the
night
with
the
countless
torches
lit
with
the
silent
sea
of
faces
and
the
unbared
heads
with
the
waiting
depot
the
arriving
coffin
and
the
sombre
faces
with
dirges
through
the
night
with
the
thousand
voices
rising
strong
and
solemn
with
all
the
mournful
voices
of
the
dirges
pour
around
the
coffin
the
churches
and
the
shuddering
organs
where
amid
these
you
journey
with
the
tolling
tolling
bells
perpetual
clang
here
coffin
that
slowly
passes
i
give
you
my
sprig
of
lilac
nor
for
you
for
one
alone
blossoms
and
branches
green
to
coffins
all
i
bring
for
fresh
as
the
morning
thus
would
i
chant
a
song
for
you
o
sane
and
sacred
death
all
over
bouquets
of
roses
o
death
i
cover
you
over
with
roses
and
early
lilies
but
mostly
and
now
the
lilac
that
blooms
the
first
copious
i
break
i
break
the
sprigs
from
the
bushes
with
loaded
arms
i
come
pouring
for
you
for
you
and
the
coffins
all
of
you
o
death
o
western
orb
sailing
the
heaven
now
i
know
what
you
must
have
meant
as
a
month
since
i
walk
as
i
walk
in
silence
the
transparent
shadowy
night
as
i
saw
you
had
something
to
tell
as
you
bent
to
me
night
after
night
as
you
dropp
from
the
sky
low
down
as
if
to
my
side
while
the
other
stars
all
look
on
as
we
wander
together
the
solemn
night
for
something
i
know
not
what
kept
me
from
sleep
as
the
night
advanced
and
i
saw
on
the
rim
of
the
west
how
full
you
were
of
woe
as
i
stood
on
the
rising
ground
in
the
breeze
in
the
cool
transparent
night
as
i
watch
where
you
pass
and
was
lost
in
the
netherward
black
of
the
night
as
my
soul
in
its
trouble
dissatisfied
sank
as
where
you
sad
orb
concluded
dropt
in
the
night
and
was
gone
sing
on
there
in
the
swamp
o
singer
bashful
and
tender
i
hear
your
notes
i
hear
your
call
i
hear
i
come
presently
i
understand
you
but
a
moment
i
linger
for
the
lustrous
star
has
detain
me
the
star
my
departing
comrade
holds
and
detains
me
o
how
shall
i
warble
myself
for
the
dead
one
there
i
loved
and
how
shall
i
deck
my
song
for
the
large
sweet
soul
that
has
gone
and
what
shall
my
perfume
be
for
the
grave
of
him
i
love
blown
from
east
and
west
blown
from
the
eastern
sea
and
blown
from
the
western
sea
till
there
on
the
prairies
meeting
these
and
with
these
and
the
breath
of
my
chant
i
perfume
the
grave
of
him
i
love
o
what
shall
i
hang
on
the
chamber
walls
and
what
shall
the
pictures
be
that
i
hang
on
the
walls
to
adorn
the
of
him
i
love
pictures
of
growing
spring
and
farms
and
homes
with
the
eve
at
sundown
and
the
gray
smoke
lucid
and
bright
with
floods
of
the
yellow
gold
of
the
gorgeous
indolent
sinking
sun
burning
expanding
the
air
with
the
fresh
sweet
herbage
under
foot
and

pale
green
leaves
of
the
trees
prolific
in
the
distance

breast
of
the
river
with

with

i
hear
yet
the
star
holds
me
but
will
soon
depart
yet
the
lilac
with
mastering
odour
holds
me
now
while
i
sat
in
the
day
and
look
forth
in
the
close
of
the
day
with
its
light
and
the
fields
of
spring
and
the
farmers
preparing
their
crops
in
the
large
unconscious
scenery
of
my
land
with
its
lakes
and
forests
in
the
heavenly
aerial
beauty
after
the
perturb
winds
and
the
storms
under
the
arching
heavens
of
the
afternoon
swift
passing
and
the
voices
of
children
and
women
the
and
i
saw
the
ships
how
they
sail
and
the
summer
approaching
with
richness
and
the
fields
all
busy
with
labour
and
the
infinite
separate
houses
how
they
all
went
on
each
with
its
meals
and
minutia
of
daily
usages
and
the
streets
how
their
throbbings
throbb
and
the
cities
pent
lo
then
and
there
falling
upon
them
all
and
among
them
all
enveloping
me
with
the
rest
appear
the
cloud
appear
the
long
black
trail
and
i
knew
death
its
thought
and
the
sacred
knowledge
of
death
then
with
the
knowledge
of
death
as
walking
one
side
of
me
and
the
thought
of
death
the
other
side
of
me
and
i
in
the
middle
as
with
companions
and
as
holding
the
hands
of
companions
i
fled
forth
to
the
hiding
receiving
night
that
talks
not
down
to
the
shores
of
the
water
the
path
by
the
swamp
in
the
dimness
to
the
solemn
shadowy
cedars
and
ghostly
pines
so
still
and
the
singer
so
shy
to
the
rest
receiv
me
the
bird
i
know
receiv
us
comrades
three
and
he
sang
the
carol
of
death
and
a
verse
for
him
i
love
from
deep
secluded
recesses
from
the
fragrant
cedars
and
the
ghostly
pines
so
still
came
the
carol
of
the
bird
and
the
charm
of
the
carol
rapt
me
as
i
held
as
if
by
their
hands
my
comrades
in
the
night
and
the
voice
of
my
spirit
tallied
the
song
of
the
bird
lovely
and
soothing
death
undulate
round
the
world
serenely
arriving
arriving
in
the
day
in
the
night
to
all
to
each
sooner
or
later
delicate
be
the
fathomless
universe
for
life
and
joy
and
for
objects
and
knowledge
curious
and
for
love
sweet
love
but
praise
praise
praise
for
the
arms
of
mother
always
gliding
near
with
soft
feet
have
none
chanted
for
thee
a
chant
of
fullest
welcome
then
i
chant
it
for
thee
i
glorify
thee
above
all
i
bring
thee
a
song
that
when
thou
must
indeed
come
come
strong
deliveress
when
it
is
so
when
thou
hast
taken
them
i
joyously
sing
the
dead
lost
in
the
loving
floating
ocean
of
thee
laved
in
the
flood
of
thy
bliss
o
me
to
thee
glad
serenades
dances
for
thee

propose
saluting
thee

and
feastings
for
thee
and
the
sights
of
the
open
landscape
and
the
sky
are
fitting
and
life
and
the
fields
and
the
huge
and
thoughtful
night
in
silence
under
many
a
star
the
ocean
shore
and
the
husky
whispering
wave
whose
voice
i
know
and
the
soul
turning
to
thee
o
vast
and
death
and
the
body
gratefully
nestling
close
to
the
i
float
thee
a
song
over
the
rising
and
sinking
waves
over
the
myriad
fields
and
the
prairies
wide
over
the
cities
all
and
the
teeming
wharves
and
ways
i
float
this
carol
with
joy
with
joy
to
thee
o
to
the
tally
of
my
soul
loud
and
strong
kept
up
the
bird
with
pure
deliberate
notes
spreading
filling
the
night
loud
in
the
pines
and
cedars
dim
clear
in
the
freshness
moist
and
the
and
i
with
my
comrades
there
in
the
night
while
my
sight
that
was
bound
in
my
eyes
unclosed
as
to
long
panoramas
of
visions
and
i
saw
askant
the
armies
i
saw
as
in
noiseless
dreams
hundreds
of
borne
through
the
smoke
of
the
battles
and
pierc
with
missiles
i
saw
them
and
carried
hither
and
yon
through
the
smoke
and
torn
and
bloody
and
at
last
but
a
few
shreds
left
on
the
staffs
and
all
in
silence
and
the
staffs
all
splinter
and
broken
i
saw
myriads
of
them
and
the
white
skeletons
of
young
men
i
saw
them
i
saw
the
débris
and
débris
of
all
the
slain
soldiers
of
the
war
but
i
saw
they
were
not
as
was
thought
they
themselves
were
fully
at
rest
they
suffer
not
the
living
remain
and
suffer
the
mother
suffer
and
the
wife
and
the
child
and
the
musing
comrade
suffer
and
the
armies
that
remain
suffer
passing
the
visions
passing
the
night
passing
unloosing
the
hold
of
my
comrades
hands
passing
the
song
of
the
hermit
bird
and
the
tallying
song
of
my
soul
victorious
song
death
outlet
song
yet
varying
song
as
low
and
wailing
yet
clear
the
notes
rising
and
falling
flooding
the
night
sadly
sinking
and
fainting
as
warning
and
warning
and
yet
again
bursting
with
joy
covering
the
earth
and
filling
the
spread
of
the
heaven
as
that
powerful
psalm
in
the
night
i
heard
from
recesses
passing
i
leave
thee
lilac
with
leaves
i
leave
thee
there
in
the
dooryard
blooming
returning
with
spring
i
cease
from
my
song
for
thee
from
my
gaze
on
thee
in
the
west
fronting
the
west
communing
with
thee
o
comrade
lustrous
with
silver
face
in
the
night
yet
each
to
keep
and
all
retrievements
out
of
the
night
the
song
the
wondrous
chant
of
the
bird
and
the
tallying
chant
the
echo
arous
in
my
soul
with
the
lustrous
and
drooping
star
with
the
countenance
full
of
woe
with
the
holders
holding
my
hand
nearing
the
call
of
the
bird
comrades
mine
and
i
in
the
midst
and
their
memory
ever
to
keep
for
the
dead
i
loved
so
well
for
the
sweetest
wisest
soul
of
all
my
days
and
lands
and
this
for
his
dear
sake
lilac
and
star
and
bird
twined
with
the
chant
of
my
soul
there
in
the
fragrant
pines
and
the
cedars
dusk
and
dim
o
captain
my
captain
o
captain
my
captain
our
fearful
trip
is
done
the
ship
has
weather
every
rack
the
prize
we
sought
is
won
the
port

near
the
bells

hear
the
people
all
exulting
while
follow
eyes
the
steady
keel
the
vessel
grim
and
daring
but
o
heart
heart
heart
o
the
bleeding
drops
of
red
where
on

for
you

for
you

for
you
they
call
the
swaying
mass
their
eager
faces
turning
here
captain
dear
father
this
arm
beneath
your
head
it
is
some
dream
that
on
the
deck
you
fallen
cold
and
dead
my
captain
does
not
answer
his
lips
are
pale
and
still
my
father
does
not
feel
my
arm
he
has
no
pulse
nor
will
the
ship
is
anchor
safe
and
sound
its
voyage
closed
and
done
from

but
i
with

nor

nor

no

charging
like

clouds
across

but

in
our
name
sing
of
the
love
we
bore
him
because
you
dweller
in
camps
know
it
truly
as
they
invault
the
coffin
there
sing
as
they
close
the
doors
of
earth
upon
him
one
verse
for
the
heavy
hearts
of
soldiers
ashes
of
soldiers
ashes
of
soldiers
south
or
north
as
i
muse
retrospective
murmuring
a
chant
in
thought
the
war
resumes
again
to
my
sense
your
shapes
and
again
the
advance
of
the
armies
noiseless
as
mists
and
vapours
from
their
graves
in
the
trenches
ascending
from
cemeteries
all
through
virginia
and
tennessee
from
every
point
of
the
compass
out
of
the
countless
graves
in
wafted
clouds
in
myriads
large
or
squads
of
twos
or
threes
or
single
ones
they
come
and
silently
gather
round
me
now
sound
no
note
o
trumpeters
not
at
the
head
of
my
cavalry
parading
on
spirited
horses
with
sabres
drawn
and
glistening
and
carbines
by
their
thighs
ah
my
brave
horsemen
my
handsome
horsemen
what
life
what
joy
and
pride
with
all
the
perils
were
yours
nor
you
drummers
neither
at
reveillé
at
dawn
nor
the
long
roll
alarming
the
camp
nor
even
the
muffled
beat
for
a
burial
nothing
from
you
this
time
o
drummers
bearing
my
warlike
drums
but
aside
from
these
and
the
marts
of
wealth
and
the
crowded
promenade
admitting
around
me
comrades
close
unseen
by
the
rest
and
voiceless
the
slain
elate
and
alive
again
the
dust
and
débris
alive
i
chant
this
chant
of
my
silent
soul
in
the
name
of
all
dead
soldiers
faces
so
pale
with
wondrous
eyes
very
dear
gather
closer
yet
draw
close
but
speak
not
phantoms
of
countless
lost
invisible
to
the
rest
henceforth
become
my
companions
follow
me
ever
desert
me
not
while
i
live
sweet
are
the
blooming
cheeks
of
the
living
sweet
are
the
musical
voices
sounding
but
sweet
ah
sweet
are
the
dead
with
their
silent
eyes
dearest
comrades
all
is
over
and
long
gone
but
love
is
not
over
and
what
love
o
comrades
perfume
from
battlefields
rising
up
from
the
foetor
arising
perfume
therefore
my
chant
o
love
immortal
love
give
me
to
bathe
the
memories
of
all
dead
soldiers
shroud
them
embalm
them
cover
them
all
over
with
tender
pride
perfume
all
make
all
wholesome
make
these
ashes
to
nourish
and
blossom
o
love
solve
all
fructify
all
with
the
last
chemistry
give
me
exhaustless
make
me
a
fountain
that
i
exhale
love
from
me
wherever
i
go
like
a
moist
perennial
dew
for
the
ashes
of
all
dead

if
it

it
is
still
the
greatest
city
in
the
whole
world
the
place
where
a
great
city
stands
is
not
the
place
of
wharves
docks
manufactures
deposits
of
produce
merely
nor
the
place
of
ceaseless
salutes
of
or
the
of
the
departing
nor
the
place
of
the
tallest
and
costliest
buildings
or
shops
selling
goods
from
the
rest
of
the
earth
nor
the
place
of
the
best
libraries
and
schools
nor
the
place
where
money
is
plentiest
nor
the
place
of
the
most
numerous
population
where
the
city
stands
with
the
brawniest
breed
of
orators
and
bards
where
the
city
stands
that
is
belov
by
these
and
loves
them
in
return
and
understands
them
where
no
monuments
exist
to
heroes
but
in
the
common
words
and
deeds
where
thrift
is
in
its
place
and
prudence
is
in
its
place
where
the
men
and
women
think
lightly
of
the
laws
where
the
slave
ceases
and
the
master
of
slaves
ceases
where
the
populace
rise
at
once
against
the
audacity
of
elected
persons
where
fierce
men
and
women
pour
forth
as
the
sea
to
the
whistle
of
death
pours
its
sweeping
and
unript
waves
where
outside
authority
enters
always
after
the
precedence
of
inside
authority
where
the
citizen
is
always
the
head
and
ideal
and
president
mayor
governor
and
what
not
are
agents
for
pay
where
children
are
taught
to
be
laws
to
themselves
and
to
depend
on
themselves
where
equanimity
is
illustrated
in
affairs
where
speculations
on
the
soul
are
encouraged
where
women
walk
in
public
processions
in
the
streets
the
same
as
the
men
where
they
enter
the
public
assembly
and
take
places
the
same
as
the
men
where
the
city
of
the
faithfulest
friends
stands

the

they
will
last
a

the
vast

with
their

and
hear
the

do
not

it

i
too
announce
solid

are
not
nothing
like
a

they
stand
for

all

my

o

the

like

rebuke
thee
thy

have
quell
them
all
and
left
thee
sacred
in
that
amid
thy

faults
thou
ever
aimedst
highly
in
that
thou
wouldst
not
really
sell
thyself
however
great
the
price
in
that
thou
surely
wakedst
weeping
from
thy

sleep
in
that

among
thy

thou

didst
rend
the
ones
that
shamed
thee
in
that
thou

not
wouldst
not
wear
the
usual
chains
this

thy
livid

thy
pierced

thrust
in

o

o
ship

beat
back
and
baffled
long
bear
up
o
smitten

o

continue
on

the

product
of
deathly
fire
and
turbulent

forth
from
its

of
fury
and
its

issuing
at

in
perfect

and
beauty
onward
beneath

following
its

so
thee
o

finish
the

the

dispel
the
travail
the

when
lo
reborn
high
the

answering

columbia
again
thy

o
france
fair
lustrous
star
in
heavenly
peace
clearer
more
bright
than
ever
shall
beam
immortal
thoughts
of
these
years
i
sing
how
they
pass
and
have
pass
through
convuls
pains
as
through
parturitions
how
america
illustrates
birth
muscular
youth
the
promise
the
sure
fulfilment
the
absolute
success
despite
of
people
illustrates
evil
as
well
as
good
the
vehement
struggle
so
fierce
for
unity
in
how
many
hold
despairingly
yet
to
the
models
departed
caste
myths
obedience
compulsion
and
to
infidelity
how
few
see
the
arrived
models
the
athletes
the
western
states
or
see
freedom
or
spirituality
or
hold
any
faith
in
results
but
i
see
the
athletes
and
i
see
the
results
of
the
war
glorious
and
inevitable
and
they
again
leading
to
other
results
how
the
great
cities
appear
how
the
democratic
masses
turbulent
wilful
as
i
love
them
how
the
whirl
the
contest
the
wrestle
of
evil
with
good
the
sound
and
resounding
keep
on
and
on
how
society
waits
unform
and
is
for
a
while
between
things
ended
and
things
begun
how
america
is
the
continent
of
glories
and
of
the
triumph
of
freedom
and
of
the
democracies
and
of
the
fruits
of
society
and
of
all
that
is
begun
and
how
the
states
are
complete
in
themselves
and
how
all
triumphs
and
glories
are
complete
in
themselves
to
lead
onward
and
how
these
of
mine
and
of
the
states
will
in
turn
be
convuls
and
serve
other
parturitions
and
transitions
and
how
all
people
sights
combinations
the
democratic
masses
too
serve
and
how
every
fact
and
war
itself
with
all
its
horrors
serves
and
how
now
or
at
any
time
each
serves
the
exquisite
transition
of
death
of
seeds
dropping
into
the
ground
of
births
of
the
steady
concentration
of
america
inland
upward
to
impregnable
and
swarming
places
of
what
indiana
kentucky
arkansas
and
the
rest
are
to
be
of
what
a
few
years
will
show
there
in
nebraska
colorado
nevada
and
the
rest
or
afar
mounting
the
northern
pacific
to
sitka
or
aliaska
of
what
the
feuillage
of
america
is
the
preparation
for
and
of
what
all
sights
north
south
east
and
west
are
of
this
union
welded
in
blood
of
the
solemn
price
paid
of
the
unnamed
lost
ever
present
in
my
mind
of
the
temporary
use
of
materials
for
identity
sake
of
the
present
passing
departing
of
the
growth
of
completer
men
than
any
yet
of
all
sloping
down
there
where
the

the

unsurvey

is
no

that

holds

which
aggregates

are
you
he
who
would
assume

be
a

here
in

the
place
is
august
the
terms
obdurate
who
would
assume
to
teach
here
may
well
prepare
himself
body
and

he
may
well
survey
ponder

fortify
harden
make
lithe
himself
he
shall
surely
be
question
beforehand
by
me
with
many

stern
questions
who
are
you
indeed
who
would
talk

america
have
you
studied

have
you
learn
the
physiology

pride
freedom

of
the

its

have
you
consider
the

of
the
first

of
independence
sign
by
the
commissioners
ratified
by
the

and
read
by
washington
at
the

of

have
you
possess
yourself
of
the
federal

do
you
see
who
have
left
all
feudal
processes
and
poems
behind
them
and
assumed
the
poems
and
processes
of
democracy
are
you
faithful
to
things
do
you
teach
what
the
land
and
sea
the
bodies
of
men
womanhood
amativeness
heroic
angers
teach
have
you
sped
through
fleeting
customs
popularities
can
you
hold
your
hand
against
all
seductions
follies
whirls
fierce
contentions
are
you
very
strong
are
you
really
of
the
whole
people
are
you
not
of
some
coterie
some
school
or
mere
religion
are
you
done
with
reviews
and
criticisms
of
life
animating
now
to
life
itself
have
you
vivified
yourself
from
the
maternity
of
these
states
have
you
too
the
old
forbearance
and
impartiality
do
you
hold
the
like
love
for
those
hardening
to
maturity
for
the
little
and
big
and
for
the
errant
what
is
this
you
bring
my
america
is
it
uniform
with
my
country
is
it
not
something
that
has
been
better
told
or
done
before
have
you
not
imported
this
or
the
spirit
of
it
in
some
ship
is
it
not
a
mere
tale
a
rhyme
a
prettiness
is
the
good
old
cause
in
it
has
it
not
dangled
long
at
the
heels
of
the
poets
politicians
literats
of
enemies
lands
does
it
not
assume
that
what
is
notoriously
gone
is
still
here
does
it
answer
universal
needs
will
it
improve
manners
does
it
sound
with
the
proud
victory
of
the
union
in
that
secession
war
can
your
performance
face
the
open
fields
and
the
seaside
will
it
absorb
into
me
as
i
absorb

to
appear
again

not

the

the

southerners
significant
alike
in

it

has
always
finally
befallen
each
temporizer
patcher
outsider
partialist
alarmist
infidel
who
has
ever
ask
any

of
america
what
mocking
and
scornful
negligence
the
track
strew
with
the
dust
of
skeletons
by
the
roadside
others
disdainfully
toss

pass
away

distill
from

the

and
the

the

america
justifies
itself
give
it
time
no

can
deceive
it
or
conceal
from
it
it
is
impassive
enough
only
toward
the
likes
of
itself
will
it
advance
to
meet
them
if
its
poets
appear
it
will
in
due
time
advance
to

them
there
is
no
fear
of
mistake
the

of
a

be

his

absorbs
him
as
affectionately
as

in

which
i
have
not
carefully

for
others
on
the
same
terms
sped
to
the
camps
and
comrades
found
and
accepted
from
every
state
upon
this
breast
has
many
a
dying
soldier
lean
to
breathe
his
last
this
arm
this
hand
this
voice
have
nourish
rais
restored
to
life
recalling
many
a
prostrate
form
i
am
willing
to
wait
to
be
understood
by
the
growth
of
the
taste
of
myself
rejecting
none
permitting
all
say
o
mother
have
i
not
to
your
thought
been
faithful
have
i
not
through
life
kept
you
and
yours
before
me
i
swear
i
begin
to
see
the
meaning
of
these
things
it
is
not
the
earth
it
is
not
america
who
is
so
great
it
is
i
who
am
great
or
to
be
great
it
is
you
up
there
or
any
one
it
is
to
walk
rapidly
through
civilizations
governments
theories
through
poems
pageants
shows
to
form
individuals
underneath
all
individuals
i
swear
nothing
is
good
to
me
now
that
ignores
individuals
the
american
compact
is
altogether
with
individuals
the
only
government
is
that
which
makes
minute
of
individuals
the
whole
theory
of
the
universe
is
directed
unerringly
to
one
single
individual
namely
to
you
mother
with
subtle
sense
severe
with
the
naked
sword
in
your
hand
i
saw
you
at
last
refuse
to
treat
but
directly
with
individuals
underneath
all
nativity
i
swear
i
will
stand
by
my
own
nativity
pious
or
impious
so
be
it
i
swear
i
am
charm
with
nothing
except
nativity
men
women
cities
nations
are
only
beautiful
from
nativity
underneath
all
is
the
expression
of
love
for
men
and
women
i
swear
i
have
seen
enough
of
mean
and
impotent
modes
of
expressing
love
for
men
and
women
after
this
day
i
take
my
own
modes
of
expressing
love
for
men
and
women
i
swear
i
will
have
each
quality
of
my
race
in
myself
talk
as
you
like
he
only
suits
these
states
whose
manners
favour
the
audacity
and
sublime
turbulence
of
the
states
underneath
the
lessons
of
things
spirits
nature
governments
ownerships
i
swear
i
perceive
other
lessons
underneath
all
to
me
is
myself
to
you
yourself
the
same
monotonous
old
song
o
i
see
flashing
that
this
america
is
only
you
and
me
its
power
weapons
testimony
are
you
and
me
its
crimes
lies
thefts
defections
are
you
and
me
its
congress
is
you
and
me
the
officers
capitols
armies
ships
are
you
and
me
its
endless
gestations
of
new
states
are
you
and
me
the
war
that
war
so
bloody
and
grim
the
war
i
will
henceforth
forget
was
you
and
me
natural
and
artificial
are
you
and
me
freedom
language
forms
employments
are
you
and
me
past
present
future
are
you
and
me
i
dare
not
shirk
any
part
of
myself
not
any
part
of
america
good
or
bad
not
to
build
for
that
which
builds
for
mankind
not
to
balance
ranks
complexions
creeds
and
the
sexes
not
to
justify
science
nor
the
march
of
equality
nor
to
feed
the
arrogant
blood
of
the
brawn
belov
of
time
i
am
for
those
that
have
never
been
master
for
men
and
women
whose
tempers
have
never
been
master
for
those
whom
laws
theories
conventions
can
never
master
i
am
for
those
who
walk
abreast
with
the
whole
earth
who
inaugurate
one
to
inaugurate
all
i
will
not
be
outfaced
by
irrational
things
i
will
penetrate
what
it
is
in
them
that
is
sarcastic
upon
me
i
will
make
cities
and
civilizations
defer
to
me
this
is
what
i
have
learnt
from
america
it
is
the
amount
and
it
i
teach
again
democracy
while
weapons
were
everywhere
aim
at
your
breast
i
saw
you
serenely
give
birth
to
immortal
children
saw
in
dreams
your
dilating
form
saw
you
with
spreading
mantle
covering
the
world
i
will
confront
these
shows
of
the
day
and
night
i
will
know
if
i
am
to
be
less
than
they
i
will
see
if
i
am
not
as
majestic
as
they
i
will
see
if
i
am
not
as
subtle
and
real
as
they
i
will
see
if
i
am
to
be
less
generous
than
they
i
will
see
if
i
have
no
meaning
while
the
houses
and
ships
have
meaning
i
will
see
if
the
fishes
and
birds
are
to
be
enough
for
themselves
and
i
am
not
to
be
enough
for
myself
i
match
my
spirit
against
yours
you
orbs
growths
mountains
brutes
copious
as
you
are
i
absorb
you
all
in
myself
and
become
the
master
myself
america
isolated
yet
embodying
all
what
is
it
finally
except
myself
these
states
what
are
they
except
myself
i
know
now
why
the
earth
is
gross
tantalizing
wicked
it
is
for
my
sake
i
take
you
specially
to
be
mine
you
terrible
rude
forms
mother
bend
down
bend
close
to
me
your
face
i
know
not
what
these
plots
and
wars
and
deferments
are
for
i
know
not
fruition
success
but
i
know
that
through
war
and
crime
your
work
goes
on
and
must
yet
go
on
thus
by
blue
ontario
shore
while
the
winds
fann
me
and
the
waves
came
trooping
toward
me
i
thrill
with
the
power
pulsations
and
the
charm
of
my
theme
was
upon
me
till
the
tissues
that
held
me
parted
their
ties
upon
me
and
i
saw
the
free
souls
of
poets
the
loftiest
bards
of
past
ages
strode
before
me
strange
large
men
long
unwaked
undisclosed
were
disclosed
to
me
o
my
rapt
verse
my
call
mock
me
not
not
for
the
bards
of
the
past
not
to
invoke
them
have
i
launch
you
forth
not
to
call
even
those
lofty
bards
here
by
ontario
shores
have
i
sung
so
capricious
and
loud
my
savage
song
bards
for
my
own
land
only
i
invoke
for
the
war
the
war
is
over
the
field
is
clear
till
they
strike
up
marches
henceforth
triumphant
and
onward
to
cheer
o
mother
your
boundless
expectant
soul
bards
of
the
great
idea
bards
of
the
peaceful
inventions
for
the
war
the
war
is
over
yet
bards
of
latent
armies
a
million
soldiers
waiting
bards
with
songs
as
from
burning
coals
or
the
lightning
stripes
ample
ohio
kanada
bards
bards
of

inland
bards

of

you
by
my

rise
o

from
your

rise
o
days
from
your
fathomless
deeps
till
you
loftier
fiercer
sweep
long
for
my
soul
hungering
gymnastic
i
devour
what
the
earth
gave
me
long
i
roam
the
woods
of
the
north
long
i
watch
niagara
pouring
i
travel
the
prairies
over
and
slept
on
their
breast
i
cross
the
nevadas
i
cross
the
plateaus
i
ascended
the
towering
rocks
along
the
pacific
i
sail
out
to
sea
i
sail
through
the
storm
i
was
refresh
by
the
storm
i
watch
with
joy
the
threatening
maws
of
the
waves
i
mark
the
white
combs
where
they
career
so
high
curling
over
i
heard
the
wind
piping
i
saw
the
black
clouds
saw
from
below
what
arose
and
mounted
o
superb
o
wild
as
my
heart
and
powerful
heard
the
continuous
thunder
as
it
bellow
after
the
lightning
noted
the
slender
and
jagged
threads
of
lightning
as
sudden
and
fast
amid
the
din
they
chased
each
other
across
the
sky
these
and
such
as
these
i
elate
saw
saw
with
wonder
yet
pensive
and
masterful
all
the
menacing
might
of
the
globe
uprisen
around
me
yet
there
with
my
soul
i
fed
i
fed
content
supercilious
was
well
o
soul
was
a
good
preparation
you
gave
me
now
we
advance
our
latent
and
ampler
hunger
to
fill
now
we
go
forth
to
receive
what
the
earth
and
the
sea
never
gave
us
not
through
the
mighty
woods
we
go
but
through
the
mightier
cities
something
for
us
is
pouring
now
more
than
niagara
pouring
torrents
of
men
sources
and
rills
of
the
northwest
are
you
indeed
inexhaustible
what
to
pavements
and
homesteads
here
what
were
those
storms
of
the
mountains
and
sea
what
to
passions
i
witness
around
me
was
the
sea
risen
was
the
wind
piping
the
pipe
of
death
under
the
black
clouds
lo
from
deeps
more
unfathomable
something
more
deadly
and
savage
manhattan
rising
advancing
with
menacing
front
cincinnati
chicago
unchain
what
was
that
swell
i
saw
on
the
ocean
behold
what
comes
here
how
it
climbs
with
daring
feet
and
hands
how
it
dashes
how
the
true
thunder
bellows
after
the
lightning
how
bright
the
flashes
of
lightning
how
democracy
with
desperate
vengeful
port
strides
on
shown
through
the
dark
by
those
flashes
of
lightning
yet
a
mournful
wail
and
low
sob
i
fancied
i
heard
through
the
dark
in
a
lull
of
the
deafening
confusion
thunder
on
stride
on
democracy
strike
with
vengeful
stroke
and
do
you
rise
higher
than
ever
yet
o
days
o
cities
crash
heavier
heavier
yet
o
storms
you
have
done
me
good
my
soul
prepared
in
the
mountains
absorbs
your
immortal
strong
nutriment
long
had
i
walk
my
cities
my
country
roads
through
farms
only
half
satisfied
one
doubt
nauseous
undulating
like
a
snake
crawl
on
the
ground
before
me
continually
preceding
my
steps
turning
upon
me
oft
ironically
hissing
low
the
cities
i
loved
so
well
i
abandon
and
left
i
sped
to
the
certainties
suitable
to
me
hungering
hungering
hungering
for
primal
energies
and
dauntlessness
i
refresh
myself
with
it
only
i
could
relish
it
only
i
waited
the
bursting
forth
of
the
pent
fire
on
the
water
and
air
i
waited
long
but
now
i
no
longer
wait
i
am
fully
satisfied
i
am
glutted
i
have
witness
the
true
lightning
i
have
witness
my
cities
electric
i
have
lived
to
behold
man
burst
forth
and
warlike
america
rise
hence
i
will
seek
no
more
the
food
of
the
northern
solitary
wilds
no
more
the
mountains
roam
or
sail
the
stormy
sea
