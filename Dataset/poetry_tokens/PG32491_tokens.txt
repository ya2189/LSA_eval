at
printed
a
year
ago
on
my
sister
at
dundrum
dublin
i
have
not
however
reprinted
a

a
part
of
a
book

i
have
added
a
number
of
new

have
once

become
a
part
of
the
phantasmagoria
through
which
i
can
alone
express
my
convictions
about
the
world

the
fancy

and

the
nineteenth
autumn
has
come
upon
me
since
i
first
made
my
count
i
saw
before
i
had
well
finished
all
suddenly
mount
and
scatter
wheeling
in
great
broken
rings
upon
their
clamorous
wings
i
have
looked
upon
those
brilliant
creatures
and
now
my
heart
is
sore
all
changed
since
i
hearing
at
twilight
the
first
time
on
this
shore
the
of
their
wings
above
my
head
trod
with
a
lighter
tread
unwearied
still
lover
by
lover
they
paddle
in
the
cold
companionable
streams
or
climb
the
air
their
hearts
have
not
grown
old
passion
or
conquest
wander
where
they
will
attend
upon
them
still
but
now
they
drift
on
the
still
water
mysterious
beautiful
among
what
rushes
will
they
build
by
what
lake
edge
or
pool
delight
men
eyes
when
i
awake
some
day
to
find
they
have
flown
away
in
memory
of
major
robert
gregory
now
that
we
almost
settled
in
our
house
i
name
the
friends
that
can
not
sup
with
us
beside
a
fire
of
turf
in
the
ancient
tower
and
having
talked
to
some
late
hour
climb
up
the
narrow
winding
stair
to
bed
discoverers
of
forgotten
truth
or
mere
companions
of
my
youth
all
all
are
in
my
thoughts
being
dead
always
we
have
the
new
friend
meet
the
old
and
we
are
hurt
if
either
friend
seem
cold
and
there
is
salt
to
lengthen
out
the
smart
in
the
affections
of
our
heart
and
quarrels
are
blown
up
upon
that
head
but
not
a
friend
that
i
would
bring
this
night
can
set
us
quarrelling
for
all
that
come
into
my
mind
are
dead
lionel
johnson
comes
the
first
to
mind
that
loved
his
learning
better
than
mankind
though
courteous
to
the
worst
much
falling
he
brooded
upon
sanctity
till
all
his
greek
and
latin
learning
seemed
a
long
blast
upon
the
horn
that
brought
a
little
nearer
to
his
thought
a
measureless
consummation
that
he
dreamed
and
that
enquiring
man
john
synge
comes
next
that
dying
chose
the
living
world
for
text
and
never
could
have
rested
in
the
tomb
but
that
long
travelling
he
had
come
towards
nightfall
upon
certain
set
apart
in
a
most
desolate
stony
place
towards
nightfall
upon
a
race
passionate
and
simple
like
his
heart
and
then
i
think
of
old
george
pollexfen
in
muscular
youth
well
known
to
mayo
men
for
horsemanship
at
meets
or
at
that
could
have
shown
how
purebred
horses
and
solid
men
for
all
their
passion
live
but
as
the
outrageous
stars
incline
by
opposition
square
and
trine
having
grown
sluggish
and
contemplative
they
were
my
close
companions
many
a
year
a
portion
of
my
mind
and
life
as
it
were
and
now
their
breathless
faces
seem
to
look
out
of
some
old
i
am
accustomed
to
their
lack
of
breath
but
not
that
my
dear
friend
dear
son
our
sidney
and
our
perfect
man
could
share
in
that
discourtesy
of
death
for
all
things
the
delighted
eye
now
sees
were
loved
by
him
the
old
trees
that
cast
their
shadows
upon
road
and
bridge
the
tower
set
on
the
stream
edge
the
ford
where
drinking
cattle
make
a
stir
nightly
and
startled
by
that
sound
the
must
change
her
ground
he
might
have
been
your
heartiest
welcomer
when
with
the
galway
foxhounds
he
would
ride
from
castle
taylor
to
the
roxborough
side
or
esserkelly
plain
few
kept
his
pace
at
mooneen
he
had
leaped
a
place
so
perilous
that
half
the
astonished
meet
had
shut
their
eyes
and
where
was
it
he
rode
a
race
without
a
bit
and
yet
his
mind
outran
the
horses
feet
we
dreamed
that
a
great
painter
had
been
born
to
cold
clare
rock
and
galway
rock
and
thorn
to
that
stern
colour
and
that
delicate
line
that
are
our
secret
discipline
wherein
the
gazing
heart
doubles
her
might
soldier
scholar
horseman
he
and
yet
he
had
the
intensity
to
have
published
all
to
be
a
world
delight
what
other
could
so
well
have
counselled
us
in
all
lovely
intricacies
of
a
house
as
he
that
practised
or
that
understood
all
work
in
metal
or
in
wood
in
moulded
plaster
or
in
carven
stone
soldier
scholar
horseman
he
and
all
he
did
done
perfectly
as
though
he
had
but
that
one
trade
alone
some
burn
damp
fagots
others
may
consume
the
entire
combustible
world
in
one
small
room
as
though
dried
straw
and
if
we
turn
about
the
bare
chimney
is
gone
black
out
because
the
work
had
finished
in
that
flare
soldier
scholar
horseman
he
as
all
life
epitome
what
made
us
dream
that
he
could
comb
grey
hair
i
had
thought
seeing
how
bitter
is
that
wind
that
shakes
the
shutter
to
have
brought
to
mind
all
those
that
manhood
tried
or
childhood
loved
or
boyish
intellect
approved
with
some
appropriate
commentary
on
each
until
imagination
brought
a
fitter
welcome
but
a
thought
of
that
late
death
took
all
my
heart
for
speech
an
irish
airman
foresees
his
death
i
know
that
i
shall
meet
my
fate
somewhere
among
the
clouds
above
those
that
i
fight
i
do
not
hate
those
that
i
guard
i
do
not
love
my
country
is
kiltartan
cross
my
countrymen
kiltartan
poor
no
likely
end
could
bring
them
loss
or
leave
them
happier
than
before
nor
law
nor
duty
bade
me
fight
nor
public
man
nor
angry
crowds
a
lonely
impulse
of
delight
drove
to
this
tumult
in
the
clouds
i
balanced
all
brought
all
to
mind
the
years
to
come
seemed
waste
of
breath
a
waste
of
breath
the
years
behind
in
balance
with
this
life
this
death
men
improve
with
the
years
i
am
worn
out
with
dreams
a
marble
triton
among
the
streams
and
all
day
long
i
look
upon
this
lady
beauty
as
though
i
had
found
in
book
a
pictured
beauty
pleased
to
have
filled
the
eyes
or
the
discerning
ears
delighted
to
be
but
wise
for
men
improve
with
the
years
and
yet
and
yet
is
this
my
dream
or
the
truth
o
would
that
we
had
met
when
i
had
my
burning
youth
but
i
grow
old
among
dreams
a
marble
triton
among
the
streams
the
of
a
hare
would
i
could
cast
a
sail
on
the
water
where
many
a
king
has
gone
and
many
a
king
daughter
and
alight
at
the
comely
trees
and
the
lawn
the
playing
upon
pipes
and
the
dancing
and
learn
that
the
best
thing
is
to
change
my
loves
while
dancing
and
pay
but
a
kiss
for
a
kiss
i
would
find
by
the
edge
of
that
water
the
of
a
hare
worn
thin
by
the
lapping
of
water
and
pierce
it
through
with
a
gimlet
and
stare
at
the
old
bitter
world
where
they
marry
in
churches
and
laugh
over
the
untroubled
water
at
all
who
marry
in
churches
through
the
white
thin
bone
of
a
hare
under
the
round
tower
i
lie
lapped
up
in
linen
a
deal
i
sweat
and
little
earn
if
i
should
live
as
live
the
neighbours
cried
the
beggar
billy
byrne
bones
till
the
daylight
come
on
battered
tomb
upon
a
grey
old
battered
tombstone
in
glendalough
beside
the
stream
where
the
and
byrnes
are
buried
he
stretched
his
bones
and
fell
in
a
dream
of
sun
and
moon
that
a
good
hour
bellowed
and
pranced
in
the
round
tower
of
golden
king
and
silver
lady
bellowing
up
and
bellowing
round
till
toes
mastered
a
sweet
measure
mouth
mastered
a
sweet
sound
prancing
round
and
prancing
up
until
they
pranced
upon
the
top
that
golden
king
and
that
wild
lady
sang
till
stars
began
to
fade
hands
gripped
in
hands
toes
close
together
hair
spread
on
the
wind
they
made
that
lady
and
that
golden
king
could
like
a
brace
of
blackbirds
sing
certain
that
my
luck
is
broken
that
rambling
jailbird
billy
said
nightfall
i
pick
a
pocket
and
snug
it
in
a
i
can
not
find
the
peace
of
home
on
battered
tomb
solomon
to
sheba
sang
solomon
to
sheba
and
kissed
her
dusky
face
day
long
from
we
have
talked
in
the
one
place
all
day
long
from
shadowless
noon
we
have
gone
round
and
round
in
the
narrow
theme
of
love
like
an
old
horse
in
a
pound
to
solomon
sang
sheba
planted
on
his
knees
you
had
broached
a
matter
that
might
the
learned
please
you
had
before
the
sun
had
thrown
our
shadows
on
the
ground
discovered
that
my
thoughts
not
it
are
but
a
narrow
pound
sang
solomon
to
sheba
and
kissed
her
arab
eyes
not
a
man
or
woman
born
under
the
skies
dare
match
in
learning
with
us
two
and
all
day
long
we
have
found
there
not
a
thing
but
love
can
make
the
world
a
narrow
pound
the
living
beauty
i
say
and
maybe
dream
i
have
drawn
content
seeing
that
time
has
frozen
up
the
blood
the
wick
of
youth
being
burned
and
the
oil
spent
from
beauty
that
is
cast
out
of
a
mould
in
bronze
or
that
in
dazzling
marble
appears
appears
and
when
we
have
gone
is
gone
again
being
more
indifferent
to
our
solitude
than
an
apparition
o
heart
we
are
old
the
living
beauty
is
for
younger
men
we
can
not
pay
its
tribute
of
wild
tears
a
song
i
thought
no
more
was
needed
youth
to
prolong
than
and
foil
to
keep
the
body
young
oh
who
could
have
foretold
that
the
heart
grows
old
though
i
have
many
words
what
woman
satisfied
i
am
no
longer
faint
because
at
her
side
oh
who
could
have
foretold
that
the
heart
grows
old
i
have
not
lost
desire
but
the
heart
that
i
had
i
thought
burn
my
body
laid
on
the
but
who
could
have
foretold
that
the
heart
grows
old
to
a
young
beauty
dear
why
so
free
with
every
sort
of
company
with
every
jack
and
jill
choose
your
companions
from
the
best
who
draws
a
bucket
with
the
rest
soon
topples
down
the
hill
you
may
that
mirror
for
a
school
be
passionate
not
bountiful
as
common
beauties
may
who
were
not
born
to
keep
in
trim
with
old
ezekiel
cherubim
but
those
of
beaujolet
i
know
what
wages
beauty
gives
how
hard
a
life
her
servant
lives
yet
praise
the
winters
gone
there
is
not
a
fool
can
call
me
friend
and
i
may
dine
at

end
with
landor
and
with
donne
to
a
young
girl
my
dear
my
dear
i
know
more
than
another
what
makes
your
heart
beat
so
not
even
your
own
mother
can
know
it
as
i
know
who
broke
my
heart
for
her
when
the
wild
thought
that
she
denies
and
has
forgot
set
all
her
blood
astir
and
glittered
in

eyes
the

they

in

every

so

what
dying

wind
how
but
in
zigzag
wantonness
could
trumpeter
michael
be
so
brave
or
something
of
that
sort
he
said
if
my
dearest
friend
were
dead
i
dance
a
measure
on
his
grave
the
sad
shepherd
shepherd
that
cry
from
the
first
cuckoo
of
the
year
i
wished
before
it
ceased
goatherd
nor
bird
nor
beast
could
make
me
wish
for
anything
this
day
being
old
but
that
the
old
alone
might
die
and
that
would
be
against
god
providence
let
the
young
wish
but
what
has
brought
you
here
never
until
this
moment
have
we
met
where
my
goats
browse
on
the
scarce
grass
or
leap
from
stone
to
stone
shepherd
i
am
looking
for
strayed
sheep
something
has
troubled
me
and
in
my
trouble
i
let
them
stray
i
thought
of
rhyme
alone
for
rhyme
can
beat
a
measure
out
of
trouble
and
make
the
daylight
sweet
once
more
but
when
i
had
driven
every
rhyme
into
its
place
the
sheep
had
gone
from
theirs
goatherd
i
know
right
well
what
turned
so
good
a
shepherd
from
his
charge
shepherd
he
that
was
best
in
every
country
sport
and
every
country
craft
and
of
us
all
most
courteous
to
slow
age
and
hasty
youth
is
dead
goatherd
the
boy
that
brings
my
griddle
cake
brought
the
bare
news
shepherd
he
had
thrown
the
crook
away
and
died
in
the
great
war
beyond
the
sea
goatherd
he
had
often
played
his
pipes
among
my
hills
and
when
he
played
it
was
their
loneliness
the
exultation
of
their
stone
that
cried
under
his
fingers
shepherd
i
had
it
from
his
mother
and
his
own
flock
was
browsing
at
the
door
goatherd
how
does
she
bear
her
grief
there
is
not
a
shepherd
but
grows
more
gentle
when
he
speaks
her
name
remembering
kindness
done
and
how
can
i
that
found
when
i
had
neither
goat
nor
grazing
new
welcome
and
old
wisdom
at
her
fire
till
winter
blasts
were
gone
but
speak
of
her
even
before
his
children
and
his
wife
shepherd
she
goes
about
her
house
erect
and
calm
between
the
pantry
and
the
linen
chest
or
else
at
meadow
or
at
grazing
overlooks
her
labouring
men
as
though
her
darling
lived
but
for
her
grandson
now
there
is
no
change
but
such
as
i
have
seen
upon
her
face
watching
our
shepherd
sports
at
when
her
son
turn
was
over
goatherd
sing
your
song
i
too
have
rhymed
my
reveries
but
youth
is
hot
to
show
whatever
it
has
found
and
till
that
done
can
neither
work
nor
wait
old
goatherds
and
old
goats
if
in
all
else
youth
can
excel
them
in
accomplishment
are
learned
in
waiting
shepherd
you
can
not
but
have
seen
that
he
alone
had
gathered
up
no
gear
set
carpenters
to
work
on
no
wide
table
on
no
long
bench
nor
lofty
milking
shed
as
others
will
when
first
they
take
possession
but
left
the
house
as
in
his
father
time
as
though
he
knew
himself
as
it
were
a
cuckoo
no
settled
man
and
now
that
he
is
gone
there
nothing
of
him
left
but
half
a
score
of
sorrowful
austere
sweet
lofty
pipe
tunes
goatherd
you
have
put
the
thought
in
rhyme
shepherd
i
worked
all
day
and
when
was
done
so
little
had
i
done
that
maybe
am
sorry
in
plain
prose
had
sounded
better
to
your
mountain
fancy
the
speckled
bird
that
steers
thousands
of
leagues
oversea
and
runs
for
a
while
or
a
while
upon
his
yellow
legs
through
our
meadows
he
stayed
for
a
while
and
we
had
scarcely
accustomed
our
ears
to
his
speech
at
the
break
of
day
had
scarcely
accustomed
our
eyes
to
his
shape
in
the
lengthening
shadows
where
the
sheep
are
thrown
in
the
pool
when
he
vanished
from
ears
and
eyes
i
had
wished
a
dear
thing
on
that
day
i
heard
him
first
but
man
is
a
fool
goatherd
you
sing
as
always
of
the
natural
life
and
i
that
made
like
music
in
my
youth
hearing
it
now
have
sighed
for
that
young
man
and
certain
lost
companions
of
my
own
shepherd
they
say
that
on
your
barren
mountain
ridge
you
have
measured
out
the
road
that
the
soul
treads
when
it
has
vanished
from
our
natural
eyes
that
you
have
talked
with
apparitions
goatherd
indeed
my
daily
thoughts
since
the
first
stupor
of
youth
have
found
the
path
my
goats
feet
can
not
find
shepherd
sing
for
it
may
be
that
your
thoughts
have
plucked
some
medicable
herb
to
make
our
grief
less
bitter
goatherd
they
have
brought
me
from
that
ridge
seed
pods
and
flowers
that
are
not
all
wild
poppy
grows
younger
every
second
that
were
all
his
birthdays
reckoned
much
too
solemn
seemed
because
of
what
he
had
dreamed
or
the
ambitions
that
he
served
much
too
solemn
and
reserved
jaunting
journeying
to
his
own
dayspring
he
unpacks
the
loaded
pern
of
all
was
pain
or
joy
to
learn
of
all
that
he
had
made
the
outrageous
war
shall
fade
at
some
old
winding
whitethorn
root
he
practice
on
the
shepherd
flute
or
on
the
grass
court
his
shepherd
lass
or
run
where
lads
reform
our
till
that
is
their
long
shouting
knowledge
he
shall
unwind
through
victories
of
the
mind
till
clambering
at
the
cradle
side
he
dreams
himself
his
mother
pride
all
knowledge
lost
in
trance
of
sweeter
ignorance
shepherd
when
i
have
shut
these
ewes
and
this
old
ram
into
the
fold
we
to
the
woods
and
there
cut
out
our
rhymes
on
strips
of
bark
but
put
no
name
and
leave
them
at
her
door
to
know
the
mountain
and
the
valley
grieve
may
be
a
quiet
thought
to
wife
and
mother
and
children
when
they
spring
up
shoulder
high
lines
written
in
dejection
when
have
i
last
looked
on
the
round
green
eyes
and
the
long
wavering
bodies
of
the
dark
leopards
of
the
moon
all
the
wild
witches
those
most
noble
ladies
for
all
their
and
their
tears
their
angry
tears
are
gone
the
holy
centaurs
of
the
hills
are
banished
and
i
have
nothing
but
harsh
sun
heroic
mother
moon
has
vanished
and
now
that
i
have
come
to
fifty
years
i
must
endure
the
timid
sun
the
dawn
i
would
be
ignorant
as
the
dawn
that
has
looked
down
on
that
old
queen
measuring
a
town
with
the
pin
of
a
brooch
or
on
the
withered
men
that
saw
from
their
pedantic
babylon
the
careless
planets
in
their
courses
the
stars
fade
out
where
the
moon
comes
and
took
their
tablets
and
did
sums
i
would
be
ignorant
as
the
dawn
that
merely
stood
rocking
the
glittering
coach
above
the
cloudy
shoulders
of
the
horses
i
would
be
for
no
knowledge
is
worth
a
straw
ignorant
and
wanton
as
the
dawn
on
woman
may
god
be
praised
for
woman
that
gives
up
all
her
mind
a
man
may
find
in
no
man
a
friendship
of
her
kind
that
covers
all
he
has
brought
as
with
her
flesh
and
bone
nor
quarrels
with
a
thought
because
it
is
not
her
own
though
pedantry
denies
it
plain
the
bible
means
that
solomon
grew
wise
while
talking
with
his
queens
yet
never
could
although
they
say
he
counted
grass
count
all
the
praises
due
when
sheba
was
his
lass
when
she
the
iron
wrought
or
when
from
the
smithy
fire
it
shuddered
in
the
water
harshness
of
their
desire
that
made
them
stretch
and
yawn
pleasure
that
comes
with
sleep
shudder
that
made
them
one
what
else
he
give
or
keep
god
grant
me
no
not
here
for
i
am
not
so
bold
to
hope
a
thing
so
dear
now
i
am
growing
old
but
when
if
the
tale
true
the
pestle
of
the
moon
that
pounds
up
all
anew
brings
me
to
birth
again
to
find
what
once
i
had
and
know
what
once
i
have
known
until
i
am
driven
mad
sleep
driven
from
my
bed
by
tenderness
and
care
pity
an
aching
head
gnashing
of
teeth
despair
and
all
because
of
some
one
perverse
creature
of
chance
and
live
like
solomon
that
sheba
led
a
dance
the
fisherman
although
i
can
see
him
still
the
freckled
man
who
goes
to
a
grey
place
on
a
hill
in
grey
connemara
clothes
at
dawn
to
cast
his
flies
it
long
since
i
began
to
call
up
to
the
eyes
this
wise
and
simple
man
all
day
i
looked
in
the
face
what
i
had
hoped
be
to
write
for
my
own
race
and
the
reality
the
living
men
that
i
hate
the
dead
man
that
i
loved
the
craven
man
in
his
seat
the
insolent
unreproved
and
no
knave
brought
to
book
who
has
won
a
drunken
cheer
the
witty
man
and
his
joke
aimed
at
the
commonest
ear
the
clever
man
who
cries
the
of
the
clown
the
beating
down
of
the
wise
and
great
art
beaten
down
maybe
a
twelvemonth
since
suddenly
i
began
in
scorn
of
this
audience
imagining
a
man
and
his
face
and
grey
connemara
cloth
climbing
up
to
a
place
where
stone
is
dark
under
froth
and
the
down
turn
of
his
wrist
when
the
flies
drop
in
the
stream
a
man
who
does
not
exist
a
man
who
is
but
a
dream
and
cried
i
am
old
i
shall
have
written
him
one
poem
maybe
as
cold
and
passionate
as
the
dawn
the
hawk
down
the
hawk
from
the
air
let
him
be
hooded
or
caged
till
the
yellow
eye
has
grown
mild
for
larder
and
spit
are
bare
the
old
cook
enraged
the
scullion
gone
wild
will
not
be
clapped
in
a
hood
nor
a
cage
nor
alight
upon
wrist
now
i
have
learnt
to
be
proud
hovering
over
the
wood
in
the
broken
mist
or
tumbling
cloud
tumbling
cloud
did
you
cleave
hawk
of
the
mind
last
evening
that
i
who
had
sat
dumbfounded
before
a
knave
should
give
to
my
friend
a
pretence
of
wit
memory
one
had
a
lovely
face
and
two
or
three
had
charm
but
charm
and
face
were
in
vain
because
the
mountain
grass
can
not
but
keep
the
form
where
the
mountain
hare
has
lain
her
praise
she
is
foremost
of
those
that
i
would
hear
praised
i
have
gone
about
the
house
gone
up
and
down
as
a
man
does
who
has
published
a
new
book
or
a
young
girl
dressed
out
in
her
new
gown
and
though
i
have
turned
the
talk
by
hook
or
crook
until
her
praise
should
be
the
uppermost
theme
a
woman
spoke
of
some
new
tale
she
had
read
a
man
confusedly
in
a
half
dream
as
though
some
other
name
ran
in
his
head
she
is
foremost
of
those
that
i
would
hear
praised
i
will
talk
no
more
of
books
or
the
long
war
but
walk
by
the
dry
thorn
until
i
have
found
some
beggar
sheltering
from
the
wind
and
there
manage
the
talk
until
her
name
come
round
if
there
be
rags
enough
he
will
know
her
name
and
be
well
pleased
remembering
it
for
in
the
old
days
though
she
had
young
men
praise
and
old
men
blame
among
the
poor
both
old
and
young
gave
her
praise
the
people
have
i
earned
for
all
that
work
i
said
all
that
i
have
done
at
my
own
charge
the
daily
spite
of
this
unmannerly
town
where
who
has
served
the
most
is
most
defamed
the
reputation
of
his
lifetime
lost
between
the
night
and
morning
i
might
have
lived
and
you
know
well
how
great
the
longing
has
been
where
every
day
my
footfall
should
have
lit
in
the
green
shadow
of
ferrara
wall
or
climbed
among
the
images
of
the
past
the
unperturbed
and
courtly
images
evening
and
morning
the
steep
street
of
urbino
to
where
the
duchess
and
her
people
talked
the
stately
midnight
through
until
they
stood
in
their
great
window
looking
at
the
dawn
i
might
have
had
no
friend
that
could
not
mix
courtesy
and
passion
into
one
like
those
that
saw
the
wicks
grow
yellow
in
the
dawn
i
might
have
used
the
one
substantial
right
my
trade
allows
chosen
my
company
and
chosen
what
scenery
had
pleased
me
best
thereon
my
phoenix
answered
in
reproof
drunkards
pilferers
of
public
funds
all
the
dishonest
crowd
i
had
driven
away
when
my
luck
changed
and
they
dared
meet
my
face
crawled
from
obscurity
and
set
upon
me
those
i
had
served
and
some
that
i
had
fed
yet
never
have
i
now
nor
any
time
complained
of
the
people
all
i
could
reply
was
that
have
not
lived
in
thought
but
deed
can
have
the
purity
of
a
natural
force
but
i
whose
virtues
are
the
definitions
of
the
analytic
mind
can
neither
close
the
eye
of
the
mind
nor
keep
my
tongue
from
speech
and
yet
because
my
heart
leaped
at
her
words
i
was
abashed
and
now
they
come
to
mind
after
nine
years
i
sink
my
head
abashed
his
phoenix
there
is
a
queen
in
china
or
maybe
it
in
spain
and
birthdays
and
holidays
such
praises
can
be
heard
of
her
unblemished
lineaments
a
whiteness
with
no
stain
that
she
might
be
that
sprightly
girl
who
was
trodden
by
a
bird
and
there
a
score
of
duchesses
surpassing
womankind
or
who
have
found
a
painter
to
make
them
so
for
pay
and
smooth
out
stain
and
blemish
with
the
elegance
of
his
mind
i
knew
a
phoenix
in
my
youth
so
let
them
have
their
day
the
young
men
every
night
applaud
their
gaby
laughing
eye
and
ruth
denis
had
more
charm
although
she
had
poor
luck
from
nineteen
hundred
nine
or
ten
pavlova
had
the
cry
and
there
a
player
in
the
states
who
gathers
up
her
cloak
and
flings
herself
out
of
the
room
when
juliet
would
be
bride
with
all
a
woman
passion
a
child
imperious
way
and
there
are
but
no
matter
if
there
are
scores
beside
i
knew
a
phoenix
in
my
youth
so
let
them
have
their
day
there
margaret
and
marjorie
and
dorothy
and
nan
a
daphne
and
a
mary
who
live
in
privacy
one
had
her
fill
of
lovers
another
had
but
one
another
boasts
pick
and
choose
and
have
but
two
or
three
if
head
and
limb
have
beauty
and
the
instep
high
and
light
they
can
spread
out
what
sail
they
please
for
all
i
have
to
say
be
but
the
breakers
of
men
hearts
or
engines
of
delight
i
knew
a
phoenix
in
my
youth
so
let
them
have
their
day
there
be
that
crowd
to
make
men
wild
through
all
the
centuries
and
maybe
there
be
some
young
belle
walk
out
to
make
men
wild
who
is
my
beauty
equal
though
that
my
heart
denies
but
not
the
exact
likeness
the
simplicity
of
a
child
and
that
proud
look
as
though
she
had
gazed
into
the
burning
sun
and
all
the
shapely
body
no
tittle
gone
astray
i
mourn
for
that
most
lonely
thing
and
yet
god
will
be
done
i
knew
a
phoenix
in
my
youth
so
let
them
have
their
day
a
thought
from
propertius
she
might
so
noble
from
head
to
great
shapely
knees
the
long
flowing
line
have
walked
to
the
altar
through
the
holy
images
at
pallas
athene
side
or
been
fit
spoil
for
a
centaur
drunk
with
the
unmixed
wine
broken
dreams
there
is
grey
in
your
hair
young
men
no
longer
suddenly
catch
their
breath
when
you
are
passing
but
maybe
some
old
gaffer
mutters
a
blessing
because
it
was
your
prayer
recovered
him
upon
the
bed
of
death
for
your
sole
sake
that
all
heart
ache
have
known
and
given
to
others
all
heart
ache
from
meagre
girlhood
putting
on
burdensome
beauty
for
your
sole
sake
heaven
has
put
away
the
stroke
of
her
doom
so
great
her
portion
in
that
peace
you
make
by
merely
walking
in
a
room
your
beauty
can
but
leave
among
us
vague
memories
nothing
but
memories
a
young
man
when
the
old
men
are
done
talking
will
say
to
an
old
man
me
of
that
lady
the
poet
stubborn
with
his
passion
sang
us
when
age
might
well
have
chilled
his
blood
vague
memories
nothing
but
memories
but
in
the
grave
all
all
shall
be
renewed
the
certainty
that
i
shall
see
that
lady
leaning
or
standing
or
walking
in
the
first
loveliness
of
womanhood
and
with
the
fervour
of
my
youthful
eyes
has
set
me
muttering
like
a
fool
you
are
more
beautiful
than
any
one
and
yet
your
body
had
a
flaw
your
small
hands
were
not
beautiful
and
i
am
afraid
that
you
will
run
and
paddle
to
the
wrist
in
that
mysterious
always
brimming
lake
where
those
that
have
obeyed
the
holy
law
paddle
and
are
perfect
leave
unchanged
the
hands
that
i
have
kissed
for
old
sakes
sake
the
last
stroke
of
midnight
dies
all
day
in
the
one
chair
from
dream
to
dream
and
rhyme
to
rhyme
i
have
ranged
in
rambling
talk
with
an
image
of
air
vague
memories
nothing
but
memories
a
vow
others
because
you
did
not
keep
that
vow
have
been
friends
of
mine
yet
always
when
i
look
death
in
the
face
when
i
clamber
to
the
heights
of
sleep
or
when
i
grow
excited
with
wine
suddenly
i
meet
your
face
presences
this
night
has
been
so
strange
that
it
seemed
as
if
the
hair
stood
up
on
my
head
from
of
the
sun
i
have
dreamed
that
women
laughing
or
timid
or
wild
in
rustle
of
lace
or
silken
stuff
climbed
up
my
creaking
stair
they
had
read
all
i
had
rhymed
of
that
monstrous
thing
returned
and
yet
unrequited
love
they
stood
in
the
door
and
stood
between
my
great
wood
lecturn
and
the
fire
till
i
could
hear
their
hearts
beating
one
is
a
harlot
and
one
a
child
that
never
looked
upon
man
with
desire
and
one
it
may
be
a
queen
the
balloon
of
the
mind
hands
do
what
you

why

you

let
you
go

it
better

in

like
these
a
poet
keep
his

shut

we
have
no

he

had
enough
of

upon

of

years
have
gone

old
william
pollexfen
laid
his
strong
bones
down
in
death
by
his
wife
elizabeth
in
the
grey
stone
tomb
he
made
and
after
twenty
years
they
laid
in
that
tomb
by
him
and
her
his
son
george
the
astrologer
and
masons
drove
from
miles
away
to
scatter
the

spray
upon

from

but
where
is
laid
the
sailor
john
that
so
many
lands
had
known
quiet
lands
or
unquiet
seas
where
the
indians
trade
or
japanese
he
never
found
his
rest
ashore
moping
for
one
voyage
more
where
have
they
laid
the
sailor
john
and
yesterday
the
youngest
son
a
humorous
unambitious
man
was
buried
near
the
astrologer
and
are
we
now
in
the
tenth
year
since
he
who
had
been
contented
long
a
nobody
in
a
great
throng
decided
he
would
journey
home
now
that
his
fiftieth
year
had
come
and
alfred
be
again
upon
the
lips
of
common
men
who
carried
in
their
memory
his
childhood
and
his
family
at
all
these
women
heard
a
visionary
white
lamenting
that
a
man
should
die
and
with
that
cry
i
have
raised
my
cry
upon
a
dying
lady
i
her
courtesy
with
the
old
kindness
the
old
distinguished
grace
she
lies
her
lovely
piteous
head
amid
dull
red
hair
propped
upon
pillows
rouge
on
the
pallor
of
her
face
she
would
not
have
us
sad
because
she
is
lying
there
and
when
she
meets
our
gaze
her
eyes
are
her
speech
a
wicked
tale
that
we
may
vie
with
her
matching
our
wit
against
her
wit
thinking
of
saints
and
of
petronius
arbiter

certain

lies

maybe
showing
her
features
when
a
tress
of
dull
red
hair
was
flowing
over
some
silken
dress
cut
in
the
turkish
fashion
or
it
may
be
like
a
boy
we
have
given
the

our

we
have
naught
for

toys

she

on

must
face
the
wall
pedant
in
passion
learned
in
old
courtesies
vehement
and
witty
she
had
seemed
the
venetian
lady
who
had
seemed
to
glide
to
some
intrigue
in
her
red
shoes
her
domino
her
panniered
skirt
copied
from

the
meditative
critic
all
are
on
their
toes
even
our
beauty
with
her
turkish
trousers
on
because
the
priest
must
have
like
every
dog
his
day

keep
us
all
awake
with
baying
at
the

and

away
iv
the
end
of

she
is
playing
like
a
child
and
penance
is
the
play
fantastical
and
wild
because
the
end
of
day
shows
her
that
some
one
soon
will
come
from
the
house
and
say
though
play
is
but
in
and
leave
the
play

her
race
she
has
not
grown
uncivil
as
narrow
natures
would

called

pleasures

she
knows
herself
a
woman
no
red

white
of
a

rank
raised
from
a
common
unreckonable
race
and
how
should
her
heart
fail

or

break

with
her
dead
brother

for
an
example
still

the
predestined

dreams
of
youth

her
come

while
wondering
still
to
be
a
shade
with
grania

all
but
the
perils
of
the
woodland
flight
forgot
that
made
her
dermuid
dear

from

the
unconquerable

by
the

call
to
my

opposite
summon
all
that
i
have
handled
least
least
looked
upon
hic
and
i
would
find
myself
and
not
an
image
ille
that
is
our
modern
hope
and
by
its
light
we
have
lit
upon
the
gentle
sensitive
mind
and
lost
the
old
nonchalance
of
the
hand
whether
we
have
chosen
chisel
pen
or
brush
we
are
but
critics
or
but
half
create
timid
entangled
empty
and
abashed
lacking
the
countenance
of
our
friends
hic
and
yet
the
chief
imagination
of
christendom
dante
alighieri
so
utterly
found
himself
that
he
has
made
that
hollow
face
of
his
more
plain
to
the
mind
eye
than
any
face
but
that
of
christ
ille
and
did
he
find
himself
or
was
the
hunger
that
had
made
it
hollow
a
hunger
for
the
apple
on
the
bough
most
out
of
reach
and
is
that
spectral
image
the
man
that
lapo
and
that
guido
knew
i
think
he
fashioned
from
his
opposite
an
image
that
might
have
been
a
stony
face
staring
upon
a
bedouin
roof
from
doored
and
windowed
cliff
or
half
upturned
among
the
coarse
grass
and
the
camel
dung
he
set
his
chisel
to
the
hardest
stone
being
mocked
by
guido
for
his
lecherous
life
derided
and
deriding
driven
out
to
climb
that
stair
and
eat
that
bitter
bread
he
found
the
unpersuadable
justice
he
found
the
most
exalted
lady
loved
by
a
man
hic
yet
surely
there
are
men
who
have
made
their
art
out
of
no
tragic
war
lovers
of
life
impulsive
men
that
look
for
happiness
and
sing
when
they
have
found
it
ille
no
not
sing
for
those
that
love
the
world
serve
it
in
action
grow
rich
popular
and
full
of
influence
and
should
they
paint
or
write
still
it
is
action
the
struggle
of
the
fly
in
marmalade
the
rhetorician
would
deceive
his
neighbours
the
sentimentalist
himself
while
art
is
but
a
vision
of
reality
what
portion
in
the
world
can
the
artist
have
who
has
awakened
from
the
common
dream
but
dissipation
and
despair
hic
and
yet
no
one
denies
to
keats
love
of
the
world
remember
his
deliberate
happiness
ille
his
art
is
happy
but
who
knows
his
mind
i
see
a
schoolboy
when
i
think
of
him
with
face
and
nose
pressed
to
a
window
for
certainly
he
sank
into
his
grave
his
senses
and
his
heart
unsatisfied
and
made
being
poor
ailing
and
ignorant
shut
out
from
all
the
luxury
of
the
world
the
son
of
a
livery
luxuriant
song
hic
why
should
you
leave
the
lamp
burning
alone
beside
an
open
book
and
trace
these
characters
upon
the
sands
a
style
is
found
by
sedentary
toil
and
by
the
imitation
of
great
masters
ille
because
i
seek
an
image
not
a
book
those
men
that
in
their
writings
are
most
wise
own
nothing
but
their
blind
stupefied
hearts
i
call
to
the
mysterious
one
who
yet
shall
walk
the
wet
sands
by
the
edge
of
the
stream
and
look
most
like
me
being
indeed
my
double
and
prove
of
all
imaginable
things
the
most
unlike
being
my
and
standing
by
these
characters

all
that
i
seek
and
whisper
it
as
though
he
were
afraid
the
birds
who
cry
aloud
their
momentary
cries
before
it
is

carry
it
away

blasphemous

grant
a

know
me
after
all
these
years
but
take
me
for
some
drunken
country
man
i
stand
and
mutter
there
until
he
caught
and
saint
and
fool
and
that
they
came
under
the
three
last
crescents
of
the
moon
and
then
i
stagger
out
he
crack
his
wits
day
after
day
yet
never
find
the
meaning
then
he
laughed
to
think
that
what
seemed
hard
should
be
so
simple
a
bat
rose
from
the
hazels
and
circled
round
him
with
its
squeaky
cry
the
light
in
the
tower
window
was
put
the
cat
and
the
moon
the
cat
went
here
and
there
and
the
moon
spun
round
like
a
top
and
the
nearest
kin
of
the
moon
the
creeping
cat
looked
up
black
minnaloushe
stared
at
the
moon
for
wander
and
wail
as
he
would
the
pure
cold
light
in
the
sky
troubled
his
animal
blood
minnaloushe
runs
in
the
grass
lifting
his
delicate
feet
do
you
dance
minnaloushe
do
you
dance
when
two
close
kindred
meet
what
better
than
call
a
dance
maybe
the
moon
may
learn
tired
of
that
courtly
fashion
a
new
dance
turn
minnaloushe
creeps
through
the
grass
from
moonlit
place
to
place
the
sacred
moon
overhead
has
taken
a
new
phase
does
minnaloushe
know
that
his
pupils
will
pass
from
change
to
change
and
that
from
round
to
crescent
from
crescent
to
round
they
range
minnaloushe
creeps
through
the
grass
alone
important
and
wise
and
lifts
to
the
changing
moon
his
changing
eyes
the
saint
and
the
hunchback
hunchback
stand
up
and
lift
your
hand
and
bless
a
man
that
finds
great
bitterness
in
thinking
of
his
lost
renown
a
roman
caesar
is
held
down
under
this
hump
saint
god
tries
each
man
according
to
a
different
plan
i
shall
not
cease
to
bless
because
i
lay
about
me
with
the
taws
that
night
and
morning
i
may
thrash
greek
alexander
from
my
flesh
augustus
caesar
and
after
these
that
great
rogue
alcibiades
hunchback
to
all
that
in
your
flesh
have
stood
and
blessed
i
give
my
gratitude
honoured
by
all
in
their
degrees
but
most
to
alcibiades
two
songs
of
a
fool
i
a
speckled
cat
and
a
tame
hare
eat
at
my
hearthstone
and
sleep
there
and
both
look
up
to
me
alone
for
learning
and
defence
as
i
look
up
to
providence
i
start
out
of
my
sleep
to
think
some
day
i
may
forget
their
food
and
drink
or
the
house
door
left
unshut
the
hare
may
run
till
it
found
the
horn
sweet
note
and
the
tooth
of
the
hound
i
bear
a
burden
that
might
well
try
men
that
do
all
by
rule
and
what
can
i
that
am
a
wandering
witted
fool
but
pray
to
god
that
he
ease
my
great
responsibilities
ii
i
slept
on
my
stool
by
the
fire
the
speckled
cat
slept
on
my
knee
we
never
thought
to
enquire
where
the
brown
hare
might
be
and
whether
the
door
were
shut
who
knows
how
she
drank
the
wind
stretched
up
on
two
legs
from
the
mat
before
she
had
settled
her
mind
to
drum
with
her
heel
and
to
leap
had
i
but
awakened
from
sleep
and
called
her
name
she
had
heard
it
may
be
and
had
not
stirred
that
now
it
may
be
has
found
the
horn
sweet
note
and
the
tooth
of
the
hound
another
song
of
a
fool
this
great
purple
butterfly
in
the
prison
of
my
hands
has
a
learning
in
his
eye
not
a
poor
fool
understands
once
he
lived
a
schoolmaster
with
a
stark
denying
look
a
string
of
scholars
went
in
fear
of
his
great
birch
and
his
great
book
like
the
clangour
of
a
bell
sweet
and
harsh
harsh
and
sweet
that
is
how
he
learnt
so
well
to
take
the
roses
for
his
meat
the
double
vision
of
michael
robartes
i
on
the
grey
rock
of
cashel
the
mind
eye
has
called
up
the
cold
spirits
that
are
born
when
the
old
moon
is
vanished
from
the
sky
and
the
new
still
hides
her
horn
under
blank
eyes
and
fingers
never
still
the
particular
is
pounded
till
it
is
man
when
had
i
my
own
will
oh
not
since
life
began
constrained
arraigned
baffled
bent
and
unbent
by
these
jaws
and
limbs
of
wood
themselves
obedient
knowing
not
evil
and
good
obedient
to
some
hidden
magical
breath
they
do
not
even
feel
so
abstract
are
they
so
dead
beyond
our
death
triumph
that
we
obey
ii
on
the
grey
rock
of
cashel
i
suddenly
saw
a
sphinx
with
woman
breast
and
lion
paw
a
buddha
hand
at
rest
hand
lifted
up
that
blest
and
right
between
these
two
a
girl
at
play
that
it
may
be
had
danced
her
life
away
for
now
being
dead
it
seemed
that
she
of
dancing
dreamed
although
i
saw
it
all
in
the
mind
eye
there
can
be
nothing
solider
till
i
die
i
saw
by
the
moon
light
now
at
its
fifteenth
night
one
lashed
her
tail
her
eyes
lit
by
the
moon
gazed
upon
all
things
known
all
things
unknown
in
triumph
of
intellect
with
motionless
head
erect
that
other
moonlit
eyeballs
never
moved
being
fixed
on
all
things
loved
all
things
unloved
yet
little
peace
he
had
for
those
that
love
are
sad
oh
little
did
they
care
who
danced
between
and
little
she
by
whom
her
dance
was
seen
so
that
she
danced
no
thought
body
perfection
brought
for
what
but
eye
and
ear
silence
the
mind
with
the
minute
particulars
of
mankind
mind
moved
yet
seemed
to
stop
as
a
in
contemplation
had
those
three
so
wrought
upon
a
moment
and
so
stretched
it
out
that
they
time
overthrown
were
dead
yet
flesh
and
bone
iii
i
knew
that
i
had
seen
had
seen
at
last
that
girl
my
unremembering
nights
hold
fast
or
else
my
dreams
that
fly
if
i
should
rub
an
eye
and
yet
in
flying
fling
into
my
meat
a
crazy
juice
that
makes
the
pulses
beat
as
though
i
had
been
undone
by
homer
paragon
who
never
gave
the
burning
town
a
thought
to
such
a
pitch
of
folly
i
am
brought
being
caught
between
the
pull
of
the
dark
moon
and
the
full
the
commonness
of
thought
and
images
that
have
the
frenzy
of
our
western
seas
thereon
i
made
my
moan
and
after
kissed
a
stone
and
after
that
arranged
it
in
a
song
seeing
that
i
ignorant
for
so
long
had
been
rewarded
thus
in
cormac
ruined
house
note
the
loaded
when
i
was
a
child
at
sligo
i
could
see
above
my
grandfather
trees
a
little
column
of
smoke
from
the
pern
mill
and
was
told
that
pern
was
another
name
for
the
spool
as
i
was
accustomed
to
call
it
on
which
thread
was
wound
one
could
not
see
the
chimney
for
the
trees
and
the
smoke
looked
as
if
it
came
from
the
mountain
and
one
day
a
foreign
asked
me
if
that
was
a
burning
mountain
