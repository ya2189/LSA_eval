in

of
the
happy
hours
spent
at

introductory
note
tuffy
todd
adventure
is
the
record
of
an
incident
which
actually
occurred
during
the
past
summer
while
the
writer
was
spending
his
vacation
in
a
retired
but
charming
part
of
the
catskill
mountains
it
was
written
for
the
amusement
of
the
guests
at
todd
hillside
home
to
whom
the
facts
as
set
forth
were
familiar
and
who
will
recognize
in
the
following
lines
the
story
as
it
originally
appeared
in
the
brook
evening
philadelphia
tuffy
todd
adventure
there
is
a
little
dog
whose
name
is
tuffy
todd
who
has
the
same
wise
look
as
many
a
dog
you
met
and
is
a
pet
but
quaintly
called
in
rhyme
a
hound
to
please
the
poet
ear
for
sound
round
as
a
mole
he
fat
and
fair
and
robed
in
coat
of
whitest
hair
his
soft
brown
eyes
are
bright
and
clear
his
little
ears
are
quick
to
hear
he
has
a
kind
expressive
face
with
every
feature
full
of
grace
in
disposition
meek
and
mild
he
gentle
as
a
little
child
but
has
his
own
peculiar
way
as
all
who
hear
will
surely
say
he
is
to
people
so
polite
you
think
he
never
bark
or
bite
but
strangers
climbing
up
the
hill
will
shout
in
vain
you
hound
be
still
and
traveler
late
in
midnight
dark
is
sure
to
hear
tuff
loudest
bark
while
tramps
who
come
about
the
yard
must
flee
or
face
a
valiant
guard
although
he
has
a
host
of
friends
to
them
he
rarely
condescends
and
their
caresses
kindly
made
are
with
indifference
coldly
paid
he
lives
for
master
orrin
todd
and
worships
him
as
household
god
with
him
tuff
wildly
romps
and
plays
and
from
his
side
but
seldom
strays
at
times
when
orrin
goes
away
to
tarry
but
a
single
day
he
bids
his
tuffy
stay
behind
and
try
to
have
a
peaceful
mind
but
tuff
so
sad
and
desolate
lies
down
alone
to
meditate
or
seeks
the
porch
a
sunny
place
to
watch
for
todd
returning
face
or
wait
until
the
voice
so
dear
shall
fall
like
music
on
his
ear
unmoved
by
other
sight
or
sound
he
lies
as
if
in
thought
profound
call
him
he
seems
both
deaf
and
dumb
unless
you
say
ho
come
when
quick
like
one
from
sleep
he
springs
and
flies
as
swift
as
bird
on
wings
to
meet
his
master
and
his
friend
then
tuffy
mourning
has
an
end
his
ways
eccentric
may
appear
but
in
the
sequel
they
be
clear
now
little
tuff
it
may
seem
strange
had
lived
at
home
nor
thought
of
change
but
one
calm
morning
clear
and
bright
as
if
new
visions
filled
his
sight
to
begged
a
ride
in
orrin
wagon
by
his
side
good
master
todd
could
not
deny
the
pleading
of
poor
tuffy
eye
and
said
jump
in
and
take
a
seat
and
you
shall
have
a
royal
treat
for
though
we
go
by
mountain
road
and
do
not
want
a
heavy
load
our
sprightly
horses
strong
and
true
will
never
mind
a
mite
like
you
then
tuff
leaped
in
and
sat
erect
as
if
to
show
his
intellect
when
off
they
rode
with
hearts
of
glee
and
warmer
friends
you
rarely
see
now
orrin
thought
it
would
be
nice
to
give
his
tuffy
some
advice
be
careful
tuffy
mine
said
he
we
go
where
many
dangers
be
turn
not
aside
nor
leave
my
track
till
setting
sun
shall
warn
us
back
in
town
you
will
a
stranger
be
again
i
say
go
not
from
me
to
which
the
simple
dog
replied
oh
never
will
i
leave
thy
side
but
follow
where
thy
footsteps
lead
thou
dearest
friend
in
time
of
need
our
tuff
can
talk
like
dogs
of
old
of
whom
in
fable
Ã¦sop
told
then
todd
to
pass
away
the
time
thus
entertained
his
guest
in
rhyme
i
always
made
you
stay
at
home
and
never
let
you
widely
roam
because
i
feared
you
might
be
lost
and
by
the
world
be
rudely
tossed
or
lest
in
some
unlucky
way
you
might
be
hurt
as
on
that
day
that
doleful
direful
day
when
life
and
death
seemed
balanced
in
the
strife
you
then
were
but
a
little
pup
and
with
a
snail
could
scarce
keep
up
but
seeing
flora
gentle
pace
you
thought
with
her
you
run
a
race
and
as
she
moved
along
the
road
and
pulled
with
care
her
heavy
load
you
chanced
to
fall
beneath
the
wheel
which
crushed
your
leg
and
made
you
reel
o
dreadful
sight
o
fearful
cry
a
mangled
limb
no
surgeon
nigh
i
stanched
the
blood
which
freely
flowed
and
in
my
arms
a
tiny
load
i
bore
you
safely
to
our
door
then
said
shall
go
out
no
more
until
your
leg
is
fully
healed
or
death
shall
take
you
from
the
field
i
set
and
bandaged
well
your
limb
should
surgeon
doubt
i
challenge
him
and
laid
you
on
an
easy
bed
and
saw
that
you
were
kindly
fed
i
closely
watched
you
night
and
day
and
did
not
fail
for
you
to
pray
when
you
had
reached
the
third
long
week
thank
god
with
reverence
do
i
speak
was
plain
you
needed
nothing
more
than
just
to
walk
about
the
floor
at
length
when
people
thought
you
dead
you
left
your
room
and
little
bed
he
they
said
as
hickory
rod
and
called
you
then
tuffy
todd
and
thus
you
see
it
strangely
came
you
have
a
soft
and
pretty
name
now
since
to
perfect
health
restored
to
thank
me
well
you
can
afford
tuff
answered
do
you
doubt
dear
friend
that
i
shall
thank
you
to
the
end
since
i
was
struck
by
wheel
so
rude
have
i
not
shown
you
gratitude
have
i
not
always
been
to
you
obedient
faithful
good
and
true
through
evil
and
through
good
report
i
never
failed
in
my
support
forsaking
friends
let
none
deny
for
you
i
lived
for
you
i
die
what
care
i
for
the
world
around
when
all
my
joy
in
you
is
found
please
pardon
if
too
bold
i
seem
and
hold
me
firm
in
your
esteem
i
did
not
mean
to
grieve
your
heart
good
tuff
nor
cause
a
single
smart
but
just
to
have
a
little
play
i
thought
i
see
what
you
would
say
in
answer
to
my
sober
talk
while
slow
the
horses
onward
walk
conversing
thus
as
friend
with
friend
at
last
they
reach
their
journey
end
todd
heart
with
anxious
fears
beset
foreboding
peril
to
his
pet
he
turns
to
tuffy
you
been
warned
in
language
clear
and
unadorned
to
stay
by
me
and
to
beware
of
dangers
lurking
everywhere
although
no
prophet
born
or
bred
though
on
my
mind
no
light
is
shed
i
fear
from
knowledge
of
your
race
day
will
end
in
your
out
jumped
brave
tuff
and
farmer
todd
but
scarce
had
gone
a
single
rod
before
they
heard
friend
tuff
for
that
your
name
i
sure
enough
how
glad
i
am
to
see
your
face
and
give
to
you
a
friend
embrace
now
while
in
town
stay
thou
with
me
and
boon
companions
we
will
be
then
tuff
poor
innocent
abroad
who
never
dreamed
of
any
fraud
replied
perhaps
we
met
before
i
take
your
word
and
ask
no
more
it
would
not
seem
polite
i
know
should
i
refuse
with
you
to
go
away
they
marched
as
large
as
life
their
hearts
with
hope
and
pleasure
rife
and
wandered
in
their
heedless
play
through
many
a
dark
and
devious
way
unchecked
they
raced
and
chased
around
a
lawless
cur
and
recreant
hound
they
took
no
note
of
time
nor
cared
how
far
they
strayed
nor
how
they
fared
for
tuff
could
not
foresee
his
woes
till
darkness
did
around
him
close
oh
tuffy
born
and
reared
in
ease
with
bread
enough
to
eat
and
cheese
where
now
thy
master
tender
care
where
now
the
bed
thou
erst
didst
share
thy
friend
all
false
will
be
in
time
of
thy
adversity
upon
the
cold
cold
ground
no
sleep
shall
come
ere
morning
light
nor
morsel
sweet
for
hungry
maw
nor
peace
for
nature
broken
law
the
westering
sun
had
low
declined
when
homeward
with
an
easy
mind
good
orrin
turned
his
horses
feet
expecting
there
his
dog
to
meet
but
drawing
near
no
tuff
was
found
to
greet
him
with
accustomed
sound
poor
orrin
could
not
sleep
a
wink
but
lay
awake
all
night
to
think
how
sad
the
fate
of
tuff
might
be
who
late
was
in
prosperity
back
in
the
early
morning
bright
to
griffin
orrin
took
his
flight
but
thoughts
of
tuff
so
filled
his
mind
no
other
thought
a
place
could
find
and
as
he
passed
each
neighbor
door
was
little
known
the
load
he
bore
the
dogs
ran
out
and
barked
so
bold
they
wakened
echoes
in
the
wold
while
ducks
and
geese
joined
in
the
strife
and
quacked
and
screamed
for
their
dear
life
then
proudly
crowed
vain
chanticleer
i
am
you
see
without
a
peer
let
none
within
my
realm
intrude
to
scare
my
hens
and
little
brood
but
patient
kine
in
farmyard
pent
were
mute
with
wonderment
while
grazing
sheep
on
hillside
near
heard
all
and
said
we
need
not
fear
each
mother
called
her
own
dear
lamb
who
answered
back
oh
here
i
am
the
squirrel
with
his
nimble
feet
now
quickly
found
a
safe
retreat
and
from
the
wall
or
limb
on
high
peeped
slyly
out
as
todd
went
by
the
birds
from
out
the
leafy
trees
so
gently
swayed
by
morning
breeze
poured
forth
their
notes
in
merry
lay
and
sang
good
speed
and
happy
day
and
insect
world
on
joyous
wing
in
sunlight
clear
did
sweetly
sing
or
hum
in
myriad
tones
so
gay
we
cheer
the
traveler
on
his
way
but
ferns
and
flowers
in
wayside
beds
with
meek
surprise
did
lift
their
heads
and
whisper
low
our
friend
in
haste
and
has
no
time
on
us
to
waste
in
days
gone
by
he
stop
awhile
to
praise
our
charms
and
make
us
smile
or
take
us
in
his
gentle
hands
as
if
rare
gifts
from
foreign
lands
and
thus
each
loving
living
thing
had
kindly
thought
or
word
to
bring
which
proved
a
balm
to
soothe
todd
soul
as
he
moved
onward
to
his
goal
the
livelong
day
through
street
and
lane
he
sought
his
dog
but
sought
in
vain
from
house
to
house
he
asked
each
man
where
tuff
pray
tell
me
if
you
can
why
tuff
has
gone
with
bruno
brown
a
dog
they
said
of
poor
renown
it
was
enough
to
turn
one
brain
to
always
hear
this
sad
refrain
retracing
now
in
twilight
drear
his
weary
steps
todd
dropped
a
tear
and
took
with
heavy
heart
the
way
his
feet
had
pressed
at
opening
day
and
walked
in
doubt
and
gloom
along
where
late
he
sang
his
cheerful
song
where
frisked
his
faithful
dog
with
glee
and
kept
him
joyful
company
poor
tuff
a
wanderer
forlorn
now
loud
bewailed
that
he
was
born
for
though
in
darkness
and
in
grief
there
came
no
friend
to
his
relief
but
being
born
he
did
not
care
just
then
to
die
with
reason
rare
he
searched
along
the
dusty
ground
to
see
where
footprints
could
be
found
when
he
with
keen
instinctive
nose
discerned
the
course
of
orrin
toes
then
light
and
hope
began
to
rise
and
cheer
the
darkness
of
his
skies
while
slow
he
kept
the
lonely
road
which
led
him
safe
to
his
abode
scarce
twelve
had
struck
the
kitchen
clock
when
lo
was
heard
a
scratch
or
knock
oh
said
his
wife
oh
orrin
dear
lost
is
found
our
tuff
is
here
then
up
sprang
orrin
with
a
bound
and
welcomed
home
his
truant
hound
whose
downcast
eye
and
trembling
frame
betrayed
a
sense
of
guilt
and
shame
but
todd
in
sweet
forgiving
mood
spread
tuff
a
couch
and
gave
him
food
and
bade
him
now
find
rest
in
sleep
and
thus
forget
his
sorrows
deep
then
tuff
in
silence
ate
his
meal
but
made
by
looks
this
sad
appeal
oh
friend
in
sorrow
and
in
cheer
there
none
on
earth
as
you
so
dear
for
all
the
trouble
i
have
brought
i
am
not
worthy
of
your
thought
and
would
receive
a
just
return
should
you
my
presence
coldly
spurn
or
from
me
turn
with
angry
frown
and
let
me
in
despair
sink
down
i
will
not
plead
in
nor
try
to
prove
my
innocence
but
truth
requires
that
i
should
say
how
i
was
duped
and
led
astray
by
cunning
dog
who
boldly
claimed
he
seen
my
home
ere
i
was
named
had
heard
of
tuffy
todd
before
when
passing
by
our
cottage
door
he
led
me
captive
at
his
will
and
made
me
suffer
direst
ill
which
was
no
more
than
i
deserved
who
from
the
path
of
duty
swerved
i
have
my
sins
and
woes
confessed
and
ask
forgiveness
peace
and
rest
oh
grant
the
mercy
which
i
crave
or
i
shall
find
an
early
grave
to
such
petition
all
unused
with
faltering
words
and
eyes
suffused
kind
orrin
made
this
brief
reply
the
same
true
friends
are
you
and
i
as
we
have
ever
been
before
we
will
be
now
and
evermore
and
since
you
mourn
this
first
offence
with
deep
and
humble
penitence
i
grant
forgiveness
full
and
free
and
trust
no
lapse
again
to
see
to
banish
care
and
doubt
and
fear
and
waken
hope
and
faith
and
cheer
good
orrin
with
a
tact
supreme
from
great
to
small
then
changed
his
theme
my
dog
quoth
he
with
morning
sun
i
see
what
can
for
you
be
done
there
comes
just
now
this
happy
thought
for
you
a
collar
shall
be
bought
that
if
perchance
you
go
astray
you
will
be
known
though
far
away
on
it
must
be
inscribed
your
name
and
latin
words
to
give
you
fame
they
shall
be
and
from
despair
may
you
be
free
what
more
did
pass
between
these
friends
the
curtain
now
around
descends
their
mutual
joys
their
mutual
woes
the
poet
pen
may
not
disclose
to
dog
and
master
both
so
true
long
life
and
peace
and
our
adieu
now
turning
from
the
gay
or
sad
this
moral
we
will
simply
add
ye
maidens
fair
and
comely
youth
accept
the
words
of
love
and
truth
all
is
gold
with
golden
gleam
all
are
friends
who
friendly
seem
tried
trusted
true
are
the
friends
we
name
for
