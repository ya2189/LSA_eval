but
i
tell
them
in
blighty
wherever
i
be
how
the
guards
came
through
victrix
how
was
it
then
with
england
her
faith
was
true
to
her
plighted
word
her
strong
hand
closed
on
her
blunted
sword
her
heart
rose
high
to
the
foeman
hate
she
walked
with
god
on
the
hills
of
fate
and
all
was
well
with
england
how
was
it
then
with
england
her
soul
was
wrung
with
loss
and
pain
her
face
was
grey
with
her
drain
but
her
falcon
eyes
were
hard
and
bright
austere
and
cold
as
an
light
and
all
was
well
with
england
how
was
it
then
with
england
little
she
said
to
foe
or
friend
true
heart
true
to
the
uttermost
end
her
passion
cry
was
the
scathe
she
wrought
in
flame
and
steel
she
voiced
her
thought
and
all
was
well
with
england
how
was
it
then
with
england
with
drooping
sword
and
bended
head
she
turned
apart
and
mourned
her
dead
sad
sky
above
sad
earth
beneath
she
walked
with
god
in
the
vale
of
death
ah
woe
the
day
for
england
how
is
it
now
with
england
she
sees
upon
her
path
dim
drifting
shapes
of
fear
and
wrath
hold
high
the
heart
bend
low
the
knee
she
has
been
guided
and
will
be
and
all
is
well
with
england
those
others
where
are
those
others
the
men
who
stood
in
the
first
wild
spate
of
the
german
flood
and
paid
full
price
with
their
heart
best
blood
for
the
saving
of
you
and
me
french
contemptibles
haggard
and
lean
allenby
lads
of
the
cavalry
screen
gunners
who
fell
in
battery
l
and
guardsmen
of
landrecies
where
are
those
others
who
fought
and
fell
outmanned
outgunned
and
scant
of
shell
on
the
deadly
curve
of
the
ypres
hell
barring
the
coast
to
the
last
where
are
our
laddies
who
died
out
there
from
poelcapelle
to
festubert
when
the
days
grew
short
and
the
poplars
bare
in
the
cold
november
blast
for
us
their
toil
and
for
us
their
pain
the
sordid
ditch
in
the
sodden
plain
the
flemish
fog
and
the
driving
rain
the
cold
that
cramped
and
froze
the
weary
night
the
chill
bleak
day
when
earth
was
dark
and
sky
was
grey
and
the
ragged
weeds
in
the
dripping
clay
were
all
god
world
to
those
where
are
those
others
in
this
glad
time
when
the
standards
wave
and
the
chime
and
london
stands
with
outstretched
hands
waving
her
children
in
athwart
our
joy
still
comes
the
thought
of
the
dear
dead
boys
whose
lives
have
bought
all
that
sweet
victory
has
brought
to
us
who
lived
to
win
to
each
his
dreams
and
mine
to
me
but
as
the
shadows
fall
i
see
that
company
the
men
who
bide
out
there
rifleman
highlander
fusilier
airman
and
sapper
and
grenadier
with
flaunting
banner
and
wave
and
cheer
they
flow
through
the
darkening
air
and
yours
are
there
and
so
are
mine
rank
upon
rank
and
line
on
line
with
smiling
lips
and
eyes
that
shine
and
bearing
proud
and
high
past
they
go
with
their
measured
tread
these
are
the
victors
these
the
dead
ah
sink
the
knee
and
bare
the
head
as
the
hallowed
host
goes
by
haig

moving
august
haig

plain

gossip
and
the
chatter

in

fears
in

pessimistic
froth
and

haig

moving
haig

we
can
turn
from
german
scheming
from
humanitarian
dreaming
from
assertions
contradictions
twisted
facts
and
solemn
fictions
haig
is
moving
haig
is
moving
all
the
weary
idle
phrases
empty
blamings
empty
praises
here
an
end
to
their
recital
there
is
only
one
thing
vital
haig
is
moving
haig
is
moving
he
is
moving
he
is
gaining
and
the
whole
hushed
world
is
straining
straining
yearning
for
the
vision
of
the
doom
and
the
decision
haig
is
moving
the
guns
in
sussex
light
green
of
grass
and
richer
green
of
bush
slope
upwards
to
the
darkest
green
of
fir
how
still
how
deathly
still
and
yet
the
hush
shivers
and
trembles
with
some
subtle
stir
some
throbbing
like
a
muffled
drum
beaten
in
broken
rhythm
oversea
to
play
the
last
funereal
march
of
some
who
die
that
europe
may
be
free
the
heaven
curving
from
the
green
spans
with
its
shimmering
arch
the
flowery
zone
in
all
god
earth
there
is
no
gentler
scene
and
yet
i
hear
that
awesome
monotone
above
the
circling
midge
piping
shrill
and
the
long
droning
of
the
questing
bee
above
all
sultry
summer
sounds
it
still
mutters
its
ceaseless
menaces
to
me
and
as
i
listen
all
the
garden
fair
darkens
to
plains
of
misery
and
death
and
looking
past
the
roses
i
see
there
those
sordid
furrows
with
the
rising
breath
of
all
things
foul
and
black
my
heart
is
hot
within
me
as
i
view
it
and
i
cry
better
the
misery
of
these
men
lot
than
all
the
peace
that
comes
to
such
as
i
and
strange
that
in
the
pauses
of
the
sound
i
hear
the
children
laughter
as
they
roam
and
then
their
mother
calls
and
all
around
rise
up
the
gentle
murmurs
of
a
home
but
still
i
gaze
afar
and
at
the
sight
my
whole
soul
softens
to
its
prayer
spirit
of
justice
thou
for
whom
they
fight
ah
turn
in
mercy
to
our
lads
out
there
the
froward
peoples
have
deserved
thy
wrath
and
on
them
is
the
judgment
as
of
old
but
if
they
wandered
from
the
hallowed
path
yet
is
their
retribution
manifold
behold
all
europe
writhing
on
the
rack
the
sins
of
fathers
grinding
down
the
sons
how
long
o
lord
he
sends
no
answer
back
but
still
i
hear
the
mutter
of
the
guns
ypres
september
push
on
my
lord
of
würtemberg
across
the
flemish
fen
see
where
the
lure
of
ypres
calls
you
there
just
one
ragged
british
line
of
plumer
weary
men
it
true
they
held
you
off
before
but
venture
it
again
come
try
your
luck
whatever
fate
befalls
you
you
been
some
little
time
my
lord
perhaps
you
scarce
remember
the
early
days
of
that
resistance
was
it
in
october
last
or
was
it
in
november
and
now
the
leaves
are
turning
and
you
stand
in
still
staring
at
the
belfry
in
the
distance
can
you
recall
the
fateful
day
a
day
of
drifting
skies
when
you
started
on
the
famous
calais
onset
can
it
be
the
blundered
when
he
urged
the
enterprise
for
surely
it
a
weary
while
since
first
before
your
eyes
that
old
belfry
rose
against
the
sunset
you
held
council
at
your
quarters
when
the
budding
alexanders
and
the
cæsars
gave
their
reasons
was
there
one
amongst
that
circle
of
commanders
ever
ventured
the
opinion
that
a
little
town
of
flanders
would
hold
you
pounded
here
through
all
the
seasons
you
all
clasped
hands
upon
it
you
would
break
the
british
line
you
would
smash
a
road
to
westward
with
your
host
the
howitzers
should
thunder
and
the
uhlan
lances
shine
till
calais
heard
the
blaring
of
the
distant
wacht
am
rhein
as
you
topped
the
grassy
uplands
of
the
coast
said
the
graf
von
it
a
fact
beyond
discussion
that
man
to
man
we
can
outfight
the
foe
there
is
valour
in
the
french
there
is
patience
in
the
russian
but
blend
all
virtues
and
you
get
the
lordly
prussian
and
the
murmured
ist
and
the
british
cried
another
they
are
mercenary
cattle
without
one
noble
impulse
of
the
soul
degenerate
and
drunken
if
the
dollars
chink
and
rattle
is
the
only
sort
of
music
that
will
call
them
to
the
battle
and
all
the
cried
wohl
and
so
next
day
your
battle
rolled
across
the
menin
plain
where
capper
men
stood
lonely
to
your
wrath
you
broke
him
and
you
broke
him
but
you
broke
him
all
in
vain
for
he
and
his
contemptibles
kept
closing
up
again
and
the
khaki
bar
was
still
across
your
path
and
on
the
day
when
gheluvelt
lay
smoking
in
the
sun
when
von
deimling
stormed
so
hotly
in
the
van
you
smiled
as
haig
reeled
backwards
and
you
thought
him
on
the
run
but
alas
for
dreams
that
vanish
for
before
the
day
was
done
it
was
you
my
lord
of
würtemberg
that
ran
a
dreary
day
was
that
but
another
came
more
dreary
when
the
guard
from
arras
led
your
fierce
attacks
spruce
and
splendid
in
the
morning
were
the
potsdam
grenadiere
but
not
so
spruce
that
evening
when
they
staggered
spent
and
weary
with
those
cursed
british
storming
at
their
backs
you
knew
your
spies
had
told
you
that
the
ranks
were
scant
and
thin
that
the
guns
were
short
of
shell
and
very
few
by
all
bernhardi
maxims
you
were
surely
bound
to
win
there
the
open
town
before
you
haste
my
lord
and
enter
in
or
the
may
have
telegrams
for
you
then
came
the
rainy
winter
when
the
price
was
ever
dearer
every
time
you
neared
the
prize
of
which
you
dreamed
each
day
the
belfry
faced
you
but
you
never
brought
it
nearer
each
night
you
saw
it
clearly
but
you
never
saw
it
clearer
ah
what
a
weary
time
it
must
have
seemed
at
last
there
came
the
easter
when
you
loosed
the
coward
gases
surely
you
have
got
the
rascals
now
you
could
see
them
spent
and
choking
as
you
watched
them
thro
your
glasses
yes
they
choke
but
never
waver
and
again
the
moment
passes
without
one
leaf
of
laurel
for
your
brow
then
at
hooge
you
had
them
helpless
for
their
guns
were
one
to
ten
and
you
blasted
trench
and
traverse
at
your
will
you
had
them
dead
and
buried
but
they
still
sprang
up
again
cried
your
lordship
cried
your
men
for
their
very
ghosts
were
guarding
ypres
still
active
guards
reserve
men
of
every
corps
and
name
that
the
bugles
of
the
muster
in
each
in
turn
you
tried
them
but
the
story
was
the
same
play
it
how
you
would
my
lord
you
never
won
the
game
no
never
in
a
twelvemonth
did
you
win
a
year
my
lord
of
würtemberg
a
year
or
nearly
so
since
first
you
faced
the
british
your
learned
commandanten
are
the
men
who
ought
to
know
but
to
ordinary
mortals
it
would
seem
a
trifle
slow
if
you
really
mean
to
travel
to
the
sea
if
you
can
not
the
british
since
they
you
so
well
you
can
safely
smash
the
town
that
lies
so
near
so
it
down
with
arch
and
buttress
down
with
belfry
and
with
bell
and
it
the
that
can
drop
the
petrol
shell
on
the
shrines
that
pious
hands
have
loved
to
rear
fair
ypres
was
a
relic
of
the
soul
of
other
days
a
poet
dream
a
wanderer
delight
we
will
keep
it
as
a
symbol
of
your
brute
teutonic
ways
that
millions
yet
unborn
may
come
and
curse
you
as
they
gaze
at
this
token
of
your
impotence
and
spite
for
shame
my
lord
of
würtemberg
across
the
flemish
fen
see
where
the
little
army
calls
you
it
just
the
old
familiar
line
of
fifty
thousand
men
they
beat
you
once
or
twice
my
lord
but
venture
it
again
come
try
your
luck
whatever
fate
befalls
you
grousing
the
army
swore
terribly

dreams
are
passed
and
gone
old
man
that
came
to
you
and
me
of
a
six
days
stunt
on
an
east
coast
front
and
the
hun
with
his
back
to
the
sea
lord
how
we
worked
and
swotted
sore
to
be
fit
when
the
day
should
come
four
years
my
lad
and
five
months
more
since
first
we
followed
the
drum
though
follow
the
drum
is
a
bit
too
grand
for
we
ran
to
no
such
frills
it
was
just
the
whistles
of
nature
band
that
heartened
us
up
the
hills
that
and
the
toot
of
the
corporal
flute
until
he
could
blow
no
more
and
the
lilt
of
sussex
by
the
sea
the
marching
song
of
the
corps
those
hills
my
word
you
would
soon
get
fit
be
you
ever
so
stale
and
slack
if
you
pad
it
with
rifle
and
marching
kit
to
rotherfield
hill
and
back
drills
in
hall
and
drills
outdoors
and
drills
of
every
type
till
we
wore
our
boots
with
forming
fours
and
our
coats
with
shoulder
hipe
no
glory
ours
no
swank
no
pay
one
dull
eventless
grind
find
yourself
and
nothing
a
day
were
the
terms
that
the
old
boys
signed
just
drill
and
march
and
drill
again
and
swot
at
the
old
parade
but
they
got
two
hundred
thousand
men
not
bad
for
the
old
brigade
a
good
two
hundred
thousand
came
on
the
chance
of
that
east
coast
fight
they
may
have
been
old
and
stiff
and
lame
but
by
george
their
hearts
were
right
discipline
my
eyes
right
they
cried
as
we
passed
the
drill
hall
door
and
left
it
at
that
so
we
marched
from
three
to
four
and
solid
why
after
a
real
wet
bout
in
a
hole
in
the
flanders
mud
it
would
puzzle
the
boche
to
fetch
us
out
for
we
could
get
out
if
we
would
some
think
we
could
have
stood
war
test
some
say
that
we
could
not
but
a
chap
can
only
do
his
best
and
offer
all
he
got
fall
out
the
guard
the
old
home
guard
pile
arms
right
turn
dismiss
no
grousing
even
if
it
hard
to
break
our
ranks
like
this
we
ca
show
much
in
the
way
of
fun
for
four
and
a
half
years
gone
if
we
had
our
chance
just
one
just
one
carry
on
old
sport
carry
on
the
night
patrol
september
behind
me
on
the
darkened
pier
they
crowd
and
chatter
man
and
maid
a
gently
strikes
the
ear
a
flapper
giggles
in
the
shade
there
where
the
lantern
gleams
it
shines
on
khaki
and
on
brass
across
its
yellow
slanting
beams
the
lovers
slowly
pass
out
in
the
darkness
one
far
light
throbs
like
a
pulse
and
fades
away
some
signal
on
the
guarded
wight
from
helen
point
to
bembridge
bay
an
eastern
wind
blows
chill
and
raw
cheerless
and
black
the
waters
lie
and
as
i
gaze
athwart
the
haze
i
see
the
night
patrol
go
by
creeping
shadows
blur
the
gloom
thicken
and
darken
pass
and
fade
again
and
yet
again
they
loom
one
ruby
spark
above
each
shade
twelve
ships
in
all
they
glide
so
near
one
hears
the
wave
the
curled
and
yet
to
those
upon
the
pier
they
seem
some
other
sterner
world
the
whimpers
to
a
wail
the
treble
laughter
sinks
and
dies
the
lovers
cluster
on
the
rail
with
whispered
words
and
straining
eyes
one
hush
of
awe
and
then
once
more
the
vision
fades
for
them
and
me
and
there
is
laughter
on
the
shore
and
silent
duty
on
the
sea
the
wreck
on
loch
mcgarry
if
you
should
search
all
scotland
round
the
mainland
skerries
and
the
islands
a
grimmer
spot
could
not
be
found
than
loch
mcgarry
in
the
highlands
pent
in
by
frowning
mountains
high
it
stretches
silent
as
the
tomb
turbid
and
thick
its
waters
lie
no
eye
can
pierce
their
yellow
gloom
was
here
that
on
a
summer
day
four
tourists
hired
a
crazy
wherry
no
warning
voices
bade
them
stay
as
they
pushed
out
on
loch
mcgarry
mcfarlane
chairman
of
the
board
a
grim
son
of
lucre
his
thoughts
were
ever
on
his
hoard
and
life
a
like
euchre
bob
ainslie
late
of
london
town
a
spruce
young
butterfly
of
fashion
a
wrinkle
in
his
would
rouse
an
apoplectic
passion
john
waters
john
the
with
thoughts
for
ever
inward
bent
complacent
wrapped
in
eternal
lastly
coquettish
wild
chattering
rowdy
at
sight
of
her
the
whole
world
smiled
except
the
wretch
whom
she
had
wedded
such
were
the
four
who
sailed
that
day
to
the
highlands
each
a
stranger
sunlit
and
calm
the
wide
loch
lay
with
not
a
hint
of
coming
danger
drifting
they
watched
the
heather
hue
the
waters
and
the
cliffs
that
bound
them
the
air
was
still
the
sky
was
blue
deceitful
peace
lay
all
around
them
mcfarlane
pondered
on
the
stocks
john
waters
on
his
own
perfection
bob
ainslie
thoughts
were
on
his
socks
and
wild
on
her
complexion
when
sudden
oh
that
dreadful
scream
that
cry
from
panic
fear
begotten
the
boat
is
gaping
in
each
seam
the
planks
are
old
and
rotten
with
two
small
oars
they
work
and
strain
a
long
mile
from
the
nearer
shore
they
cease
their
efforts
are
in
vain
she
sinking
fast
and
all
is
the
yellow
water
thick
as
pap
is
crawling
crawling
to
the
thwarts
and
as
they
mark
its
upward
lap
so
fear
goes
crawling
up
their
hearts
slowly
slowly
thick
as
pap
the
creeping
yellow
waters
rise
like
drowning
mice
within
a
trap
they
stare
around
with
frantic
eyes
ah
how
clearly
they
could
see
every
sin
and
shame
and
error
how
they
vowed
that
saints
they
be
if
delivered
from
this
terror
how
they
squirmed
and
how
they
squealed
how
they
shouted
for
assistance
how
they
fruitlessly
appealed
to
the
shepherds
in
the
distance
how
they
sobbed
and
how
they
moaned
as
the
waters
kept
encroaching
how
they
wept
and
stormed
and
groaned
as
they
saw
their
fate
approaching
and
they
vowed
each
good
resolve
should
be
permanent
as
granite
never
never
to
dissolve
firm
and
lasting
like
our
planet
see
them
sit
aghast
and
shrinking
surely
it
could
not
be
true
oh
have
mercy
oh
we
sinking
oh
good
lord
what
we
do
ah
it
coming
now
she
founders
see
the
crazy
wherry
reel
downward
to
the
rocks
she
flounders
just
one
foot
beneath
her
keel
in
the
shallow
turbid
water
lay
the
saving
reef
below
oh
the
waste
of
high
emotion
oh
the
useless
fear
and
woe
late
that
day
four
sopping
tourists
to
their
quarters
made
their
way
and
the
brushes
of
futurists
scarce
could
paint
their
disarray
and
with
compassion
they
were
viewed
from
the
hotel
from
the
beau
of
fashion
to
the
saturated
belle
but
a
change
was
in
their
features
and
that
change
has
come
to
tarry
for
they
all
are
altered
creatures
since
the
wreck
of
loch
mcgarry
now
mcfarlane
never
utters
any
talk
of
bills
or
bullion
but
continually
mutters
texts
from
cyril
or
tertullian
as
to
ainslie
he
not
caring
how
the
collar
lies
and
has
been
detected
wearing
with
white
ties
waters
who
had
never
thought
in
his
life
of
others
needs
has
most
generously
bought
a
for
invalids
and
the
lady
ah
the
lady
she
has
turned
from
paths
of
sin
and
her
husband
face
so
shady
now
is
brightened
by
a
grin
so
misfortunes
of
are
the
blessings
of
and
the
wisest
can
not
say
what
is
joy
and
what
is
sorrow
if
your
soul
is
arable
you
can
start
this
seed
within
it
and
my
tiny
parable
may
just
help
you
to
begin
it
the
bigot
the
foolish
roman
fondly
thought
that
gods
must
be
the
same
to
all
each
alien
idol
might
be
brought
within
their
broad
pantheon
hall
the
vision
of
a
jealous
jove
was
far
above
their
feeble
ken
they
had
no
lord
who
gave
them
love
but
scowled
upon
all
other
men
but
in
our
dispensation
bright
what
noble
progress
have
we
made
we
know
that
we
are
in
the
light
and
outer
races
in
the
shade
our
kindly
creed
ensures
us
this
that
turk
and
infidel
and
jew
are
safely
banished
from
the
bliss
that
guaranteed
to
me
and
you
the
roman
mother
understood
that
if
the
babe
upon
her
breast
untimely
died
the
gods
were
good
and
the
child
welfare
manifest
with
tender
guides
the
soul
would
go
and
there
in
some
elysian
bower
the
tiny
bud
plucked
here
below
would
ripen
to
the
perfect
flower
poor
simpleton
our
faith
makes
plain
that
if
no
blest
baptismal
word
has
cleared
the
babe
it
bears
the
stain
which
faithless
adam
had
incurred
how
philosophical
an
aim
how
wise
and
a
plan
which
holds
the
babe
to
blame
for
all
the
sins
of
early
man
nay
speak
not
of
its
tender
grace
but
hearken
to
our
dogma
wise
guilt
lies
behind
that
dimpled
face
and
sin
looks
out
from
gentle
eyes
quick
quick
the
water
and
the
bowl
quick
with
the
words
that
lift
the
load
oh
hasten
ere
that
tiny
soul
shall
pay
the
debt
old
adam
owed
the
roman
thought
the
souls
that
erred
would
linger
in
some
nether
gloom
but
somewhere
sometime
would
be
spared
to
find
some
peace
beyond
the
tomb
in
those
dark
halls
enshadowed
vast
they
flitted
ever
sad
and
thin
mourning
the
unforgotten
past
until
they
shed
the
taint
of
sin
and
pluto
brooded
over
all
within
that
land
of
night
and
fear
enthroned
in
some
dark
judgment
hall
a
god
himself
reserved
austere
how
thin
and
colourless
and
tame
compare
our
nobler
scheme
with
it
the
howling
souls
the
leaping
flame
and
all
the
tortures
of
the
pit
foolish
roman
hell
to
us
is
left
the
higher
thought
of
that
eternal
torture
cell
whereto
the
sinner
shall
be
brought
out
with
the
thought
that
god
could
share
our
weak
relenting
pity
sense
or
ever
condescend
to
spare
the
wretch
who
gave
him
just
offence
is
just
ten
thousand
years
ago
since
the
vile
sinner
left
his
clay
and
yet
no
pity
can
he
know
for
as
he
lies
in
hell
so
when
ten
thousand
years
have
run
still
shall
he
lie
in
endless
night
o
god
of
love
o
holy
one
have
we
not
read
thy
ways
aright
the
godly
man
in
heaven
shall
dwell
and
live
in
joy
before
the
throne
though
somewhere
down
in
nether
hell
his
wife
or
children
writhe
and
groan
from
his
bright
empyrean
height
he
sees
the
reek
from
that
abyss
what
pagan
ever
dreamed
a
sight
so
holy
and
sublime
as
this
poor
foolish
folk
had
they
begun
to
weigh
the
myths
that
they
professed
one
hour
of
reason
and
each
one
would
surely
stand
a
fraud
confessed
pretending
to
believe
each
deed
of
theseus
or
of
hercules
with
fairy
tales
of
ganymede
and
gods
of
rocks
and
gods
of
trees
no
no
had
they
our
purer
light
they
would
have
learned
some
saner
tale
of
balaam
ass
or
samson
might
or
prophet
jonah
and
his
whale
of
talking
serpents
and
their
ways
through
which
our
foolish
parents
strayed
and
how
there
passed
three
nights
and
days
before
the
sun
or
moon
was
made
o
bigotry
you
crowning
sin
all
evil
that
a
man
can
do
has
earthly
bounds
nor
can
begin
to
match
the
mischief
done
by
you
you
who
would
force
the
source
of
love
to
play
your
small
sectarian
part
and
mould
the
mercy
from
above
to
fit
your
own
contracted
heart
the
athabasca
trail
my
life
is
gliding
downwards
it
speeds
swifter
to
the
day
when
it
shoots
the
last
dark
cañon
to
the
plains
of
but
while
its
stream
is
running
through
the
years
that
are
to
be
the
mighty
voice
of
canada
will
ever
call
to
me
i
shall
hear
the
roar
of
rivers
where
the
rapids
foam
and
tear
i
shall
smell
the
virgin
upland
with
its
air
and
shall
dream
that
i
am
riding
down
the
winding
woody
vale
with
the
packer
and
the
packhorse
on
the
athabasca
trail
i
have
passed
the
warden
cities
at
the
eastern
where
the
hero
and
the
martyr
laid
the
corner
stone
of
state
the
habitant
and
hardy
voyageur
where
lives
a
breed
more
strong
at
need
to
venture
or
endure
i
have
seen
the
gorge
of
erie
where
the
roaring
waters
run
i
have
crossed
the
inland
ocean
lying
golden
in
the
sun
but
the
last
and
best
and
sweetest
is
the
ride
by
hill
and
dale
with
the
packer
and
the
packhorse
on
the
athabasca
trail
i
dream
again
of
fields
of
grain
that
stretch
from
sky
to
sky
and
the
little
prairie
hamlets
where
the
cars
go
roaring
by
wooden
hamlets
as
i
saw
them
noble
cities
still
to
be
to
girdle
stately
canada
with
gems
from
sea
to
sea
mother
of
a
mighty
manhood
land
of
glamour
and
of
hope
from
the
eastward
islands
to
the
sunny
western
slope
ever
more
my
heart
is
with
you
ever
more
till
life
shall
fail
i
be
out
with
pack
and
packer
on
the
athabasca
trail
ragtime
during
the
catastrophe
the
band
of
the
played
negro
melodies
and
ragtime
until
the
last
moment
when
they
broke
into
a
hymn
daily
paper
ragtime
ragtime
keep
it
going
still
let
them
hear
the
ragtime
play
it
with
a
will
women
in
the
lifeboats
men
upon
the
wreck
take
heart
to
hear
the
ragtime
lilting
down
the
deck
ragtime
ragtime
yet
another
tune
now
the
darkey
dandy
now
the
yellow
coon
brace
against
the
bulwarks
if
the
stand
askew
find
your
footing
as
you
can
but
keep
the
music
true
there
glowing
hell
beneath
us
where
the
shattered
boilers
roar
the
ship
is
listing
and
awash
the
boats
will
hold
no
more
there
nothing
more
that
you
can
do
and
nothing
you
can
mend
only
keep
the
ragtime
playing
to
the
end
do
forget
the
time
boys
eyes
upon
the
score
never
heed
the
wavelets
sobbing
down
the
floor
play
it
as
you
played
it
when
with
eager
feet
a
hundred
pair
of
dancers
were
stamping
to
the
beat
stamping
to
the
ragtime
down
the
deck
with
shine
of
glossy
linen
and
with
gleam
of
snowy
neck
they
other
thoughts
to
think
and
other
things
to
do
but
the
tinkle
of
the
ragtime
may
help
to
see
them
through
shut
off
shut
off
the
ragtime
the
lights
are
falling
low
the
deck
is
buckling
under
us
she
sinking
by
the
bow
one
hymn
of
hope
from
dying
hands
on
dying
ears
to
fall
gently
the
music
fades
away
and
so
god
rest
us
all
christmas
in
wartime
cheer
oh
comrades
we
can
bide
the
blast
and
face
the
gloom
until
it
shall
grow
lighter
what
though
one
christmas
should
be
overcast
if
duty
done
makes
all
the
others
brighter
the
last
lap
we
seldom
were
quick
off
the
mark
and
sprinting
was
never
our
game
but
when
it
insistence
and
we
never
been
beat
at
that
same
the
first
lap
was
all
to
the
hun
at
the
second
we
still
saw
his
back
but
we
knew
how
to
wait
and
to
spurt
down
the
straight
till
we
left
him
on
the
track
he
a
bluffer
for
all
he
is
worth
but
he
winded
and
done
to
the
core
so
the
last
lap
is
here
with
the
tape
very
near
and
the
old
colours
well
to
the
fore
not
merry
no
the
words
would
grate
with
gaps
at
every
but
chastened
thankful
calm
sedate
be
your
victorious
lindisfaire
horses
go
down
the
dingy
lane
but
never
a
horse
comes
up
again
the
greasy
yard
where
the
red
hides
lie
marks
the
place
where
the
horses
die
wheat
was
sinking
year
by
year
i
bought
things
cheap
i
sold
them
dear
rent
was
heavy
and
taxes
high
and
a

to
ride
to
hounds
and
as
i
walked
in
black
despair
i
saw
my
old
bay
hunter
there
he
tried
to
nuzzle
against
my
cheek
he
looked
the
grief
he
could
not
speak
but
no
caress
came
back
again
for
harder
times
make
harder
men
my
thoughts
were
set
on
stable
rent
on
money
saved
and
money
spent
on
weekly
bills
for
forage
lost
and
all
the
old
bay
hunter
cost
for
though
a
flier
in
the
past
his
days
of
service
long
were
past
his
gait
was
stiff
his
eyes
were
dim
and
i
could
find
no
use
for
him
i
turned
away
with
heart
of
gloom
and
sent
for
will
my
father
groom
the
old
old
groom
whose
face
was
like
the
fortune
of
our
race
i
gave
my
order
sharp
and
hard
go
ride
him
to
the
knacker
yard
he
fetch
two
pounds
it
may
be
three
sell
him
and
bring
the
price
to
me
i
saw
the
old
groom
wince
away
he
looked
the
thoughts
he
dared
not
say
then
from
his
fob
he
slowly
drew
a
leather
pouch
of
faded
hue
master
said
he
my
means
are
small
this
purse
of
leather
holds
them
all
but
i
have
neither
kith
nor
kin
i
pay
your
price
for
prince
skin
my
brother
rents
the
nether
farm
and
he
will
hold
him
safe
from
harm
in
the
great
field
where
he
may
graze
and
see
the
finish
of
his
days
with
dimming
eyes
i
saw
him
stand
two
pounds
were
in
his
shaking
hand
i
gave
a
curse
to
drown
the
sob
and
thrust
the
purse
within
his
fob
may
god
do
this
and
more
to
me
if
we
should
ever
part
we
three
master
and
horse
and
faithful
friend
we
share
together
to
the
end
you
think
i
playing
it
on
you
i
give
my
word
the
thing
is
true
i
had
hardly
made
the
vow
before
i
heard
a
and
looking
round
whom
should
i
see
but
bookie
johnson
hailing
me
johnson
the
man
who
bilked
the
folks
when
ethelrida
won
the
oaks
he
drew
a
wad
from
out
his
vest
here
are
a
thousand
of
the
best
luck
turned
a
bit
with
me
of
late
and
as
you
see
i
getting
straight
that
all
my
luck
was
turning
too
if
you
have
nothing
else
to
do
run
down
some
day
to
lindisfaire
you
find
the
old
bay
hunter
there
a
parable
house
was
furnished
well
with
many
a
goblet
fair
so
when
they
brought
the
holy
grail
there
was
never
a
space
to
spare
simple
cottage
was
clear
and
clean
with
room
to
store
at
will
so
there
they
laid
the
holy
grail
and
there
you
find
it
still
fate
i
know
not
how
i
know
and
yet
i
know
i
do
not
plan
to
go
and
yet
i
go
there
is
some
dim
force
propelling
gently
guiding
and
compelling
and
a
faint
voice
ever
telling
this
is
so
the
path
is
rough
and
black
dark
as
night
and
there
lies
a
fairer
track
in
the
light
yet
i
may
not
shirk
or
shrink
for
i
feel
the
hands
that
link
as
they
guide
me
on
the
brink
of
the
height
bigots
blame
me
in
their
wrath
let
them
blame
praise
or
blame
the
fated
path
is
the
same
if
i
droop
upon
my
mission
there
is
still
that
saving
vision
iridescent
and
elysian
tipped
in
flame
it
was
granted
me
to
stand
by
my
dead
i
have
felt
the
vanished
hand
on
my
head
on
my
brow
the
vanished
lips
and
i
know
that
death
eclipse
is
a
floating
veil
that
slips
or
is
shed
when
i
heard
thy
voice
son
of
mine
should
i
silently
rejoice
or
incline
to
strike
harder
as
a
fighter
that
the
heavy
might
be
lighter
and
the
gloomy
might
be
brighter
at
the
sign
great
guide
i
ask
you
still
wherefore
i
but
if
it
be
thy
will
that
i
try
trace
my
pathway
among
men
show
me
how
to
strike
and
when
take
me
to
the
fight
and
then
oh
be
nigh

conan
doyle
writes
a
good
song
and
a
good
ballad

has
the
requisite
amount
of
pathos
and
his
humour
is
spontaneous

the

of
rollicking
tales

fervid
exhortations
and
straightforward
arguments
sound

a
good
story

well
in
verse
as
in
prose

the
fetters
of
rhyme
in

way
weaken
the
merits
of
the

well
as
spirit
the
strong
vitality
of
the
author
pervades
his
poetry
it
is
a
tonic
to
meet
his
frank
optimism
