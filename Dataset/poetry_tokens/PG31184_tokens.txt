dedications
to
edmund
clerihew
bentley
the
dedication
of
man
who
was
a
cloud
was
on
the
mind
of
men
and
wailing
went
the
weather
yea
a
sick
cloud
upon
the
soul
when
we
were
boys
together
science
announced
nonentity
and
art
admired
decay
the
world
was
old
and
ended
but
you
and
i
were
gay
round
us
in
antic
order
their
crippled
vices
came
lust
that
had
lost
its
laughter
fear
that
had
lost
its
shame
like
the
white
lock
of
whistler
that
lit
our
aimless
gloom
men
showed
their
own
white
feather
as
proudly
as
a
plume
life
was
a
fly
that
faded
and
death
a
drone
that
stung
the
world
was
very
old
indeed
when
you
and
i
were
young
they
twisted
even
decent
sin
to
shapes
not
to
be
named
men
were
ashamed
of
honour
but
we
were
not
ashamed
weak
if
we
were
and
foolish
not
thus
we
failed
not
thus
when
that
black
baal
blocked
the
heavens
he
had
no
hymns
from
us
children
we
were
our
forts
of
sand
were
even
as
weak
as
we
high
as
they
went
we
piled
them
up
to
break
that
bitter
sea
fools
as
we
were
in
motley
all
jangling
and
absurd
when
all
church
bells
were
silent
our
cap
and
bells
were
heard
not
all
unhelped
we
held
the
fort
our
tiny
flags
unfurled
some
giants
laboured
in
that
cloud
to
lift
it
from
the
world
i
find
again
the
book
we
found
i
feel
the
hour
that
flings
far
out
of
paumanok
some
cry
of
cleaner
things
and
the
green
carnation
withered
as
in
forest
fires
that
pass
roared
in
the
wind
of
all
the
world
ten
million
leaves
of
grass
or
sane
and
sweet
and
sudden
as
a
bird
sings
in
the
rain
truth
out
of
tusitala
spoke
and
pleasure
out
of
pain
yea
cool
and
clear
and
sudden
as
a
bird
sings
in
the
grey
dunedin
to
samoa
spoke
and
darkness
unto
day
but
we
were
young
we
lived
to
see
god
break
their
bitter
charms
god
and
the
good
republic
come
riding
back
in
arms
we
have
seen
the
city
of
mansoul
even
as
it
rocked
relieved
blessed
are
they
who
did
not
see
but
being
blind
believed
this
is
a
tale
of
those
old
fears
even
of
those
emptied
hells
and
none
but
you
shall
understand
the
true
thing
that
it
tells
of
what
colossal
gods
of
shame
could
cow
men
and
yet
crash
of
what
huge
devils
hid
the
stars
yet
fell
at
a
pistol
flash
the
doubts
that
were
so
plain
to
chase
so
dreadful
to
withstand
oh
who
shall
understand
but
you
yea
who
shall
understand
the
doubts
that
drove
us
through
the
night
as
we
two
talked
amain
and
day
had
broken
on
the
streets
it
broke
upon
the
brain
between
us
by
the
peace
of
god
such
truth
can
now
be
told
yea
there
is
strength
in
striking
root
and
good
in
growing
old
we
have
found
common
things
at
last
and
marriage
and
a
creed
and
i
may
safely
write
it
now
and
you
may
safely
read
to
hilaire
belloc
the
dedication
of
napoleon
of
notting
for
every
tiny
town
or
place
god
made
the
stars
especially
babies
look
up
with
owlish
face
and
see
them
tangled
in
a
tree
you
saw
a
moon
from
sussex
downs
a
sussex
moon
untravelled
still
i
saw
a
moon
that
was
the
town
the
largest
lamp
on
campden
hill
yea
heaven
is
everywhere
at
home
the
big
blue
cap
that
always
fits
and
so
it
is
be
calm
they
come
to
goal
at
last
my
wandering
wits
so
it
is
with
the
heroic
thing
this
shall
not
end
for
the
world
end
and
though
the
sullen
engines
swing
be
you
not
much
afraid
my
friend
this
did
not
end
by
nelson
urn
where
an
immortal
england
sits
nor
where
your
tall
young
men
in
turn
drank
death
like
wine
at
austerlitz
and
when
the
pedants
bade
us
mark
what
cold
mechanic
happenings
must
come
our
souls
said
in
the
dark
belike
but
there
are
likelier
things
likelier
across
these
flats
afar
these
sulky
levels
smooth
and
free
the
drums
shall
crash
a
waltz
of
war
and
death
shall
dance
with
liberty
likelier
the
barricades
shall
blare
slaughter
below
and
smoke
above
and
death
and
hate
and
hell
declare
that
men
have
found
a
thing
to
love
far
from
your
sunny
uplands
set
i
saw
the
dream
the
streets
i
trod
the
lit
straight
streets
shot
out
and
met
the
starry
streets
that
point
to
god
the
legend
of
an
epic
hour
a
child
i
dreamed
and
dream
it
still
under
the
great
grey
that
strikes
the
stars
on
campden
hill
to
words
for
alas
my
trade
is
words
a
barren
burst
of
rhyme
rubbed
by
a
hundred
rhymesters
battered
a
thousand
times
take
them
you
that
smile
on
strings
those
nobler
sounds
than
mine
the
words
that
never
lie
or
brag
or
flatter
or
malign
i
give
a
hand
to
my
lady
another
to
my
friend
to
whom
you
too
have
given
a
hand
and
so
before
the
end
we
four
may
pray
for
all
the
years
whatever
suns
beset
the
sole
two
prayers
worth
praying
to
live
and
not
forget
the
pale
leaf
falls
in
pallor
but
the
green
leaf
turns
to
gold
we
that
have
found
it
good
to
be
young
shall
find
it
good
to
be
old
life
that
bringeth
the
marriage
bell
the
cradle
and
the
grave
life
that
is
mean
to
the
mean
of
heart
and
only
brave
to
the
brave
in
the
calm
of
the
last
white
winter
when
all
the
past
is
ours
old
tears
are
frozen
as
jewels
old
storms
frosted
as
flowers
dear
lady
may
we
meet
again
stand
up
again
we
four
beneath
the
burden
of
the
years
and
praise

up

dashed

throbbing
in

only
on

nameless
throne
a
crownless
prince

stirred
where
risen
from
a
doubtful
seat
and
half
attainted
stall
the
last
knight
of

takes
weapons
from

strides
among

giants
and
the
genii
multiplex
of
wing
and
eye
whose
strong
obedience
broke
the
sky
when
solomon
was
king
they
rush
in
red
and
purple
from
the
red
clouds
of
the
morn
from
temples
where
the
yellow
gods
shut
up
their
eyes
in
scorn
they
rise
in
green
robes
roaring
from
the
green
hells
of

fallen
skies
and
evil
hues
and
eyeless
creatures
be
on

grey
curl
splashed
with

splendid
sickness
the
sickness
of
the
pearl
they
swell
in
sapphire
smoke
out
of
the
blue
cracks
of
the
ground
they
gather
and
they
wonder

worship
to

which
was

trouble
comes
again
out
of

west

set
the
seal
of
solomon
on
all
things
under
sun
of
knowledge
and
of
sorrow
and
endurance
of
things
done

a
noise
is
in

the
voice

witless

room

forgotten

foolish
knight

gold

waxen
taper

a
hush
around
hunger
slaying

to
praise
us
when
we
are
dead
but
men
shall
remember
the
mountain
that
broke
its
forest
chains
and
men
shall
remember
the
mountain
when
it
arches
against
the
plains
and
christen
their
children
from
it
and
season
and
ship
and
street
when
the
mountain
came
to
mahomet
and
looked
small
before
his
feet
his
head
was
as
high
as
the
crescent
of
the
moon
that
seemed
his
crown
and
on
glory
of
past
and
present
the
light
of
his
eyes
looked
down
one
hand
went
out
to
the
morning
over
brahmin
and
buddhist
slain
and
one
to
the
west
in
scorning
to
point
at
the
scars
of
spain
one
foot
on
the
hills
for
warden
by
the
little
mountain
trod
and
one
was
in
a
garden
and
stood
on
the
grave
of
god
but
men
shall
remember
the
mountain
though
it
fall
down
like
a
tree
they
shall
see
the
sign
of
the
mountain
faith
cast
into
the
sea
though
the
crooked
swords
overcome
it
and
the
crooked
moon
ride
free
when
the
mountain
comes
to
mahomet
it
has
more
life
than
he
but
what
will
there
be
to
remember
or
what
will
there
be
to
see
though
our
towns
through
a
long
november
abide
to
the
end
and
be
strength
of
slave
and
mechanic
whose
iron
is
ruled
by
gold
peace
of
immortal
panic
love
that
is
hate
grown
cold
are
these
a
bribe
or
a
warning
that
we
turn
not
to
the
sun
nor
look
on
the
lands
of
morning
where
deeds
at
last
are
done
where
men
shall
remember
the
mountain
when
truth
forgets
the
plain
and
walk
in
the
way
of
the
mountain
that
did
not
fail
in
vain
death
and
eclipse
and
comet
thunder
and
seals
that
rend
when
the
mountain
came
to
mahomet
because
it
was
the
end
blessed
are
the
peacemakers
of
old
with
a
divided
heart
i
saw
my
people
pride
expand
since
a
man
soul
is
torn
apart
by
mother
earth
and
fatherland
i
knew
through
many
a
tangled
tale
glory
and
truth
not
one
but
two
king
constable
and
amirail
took
me
like
trumpets
but
i
knew
a
blacker
thing
than
blood
own
dye
weighed
down
great
hawkins
on
the
sea
and
nelson
turned
his
blindest
eye
on
naples
and
on
liberty
therefore
to
you
my
thanks
o
throne
o
thousandfold
and
frozen
folk
for
whose
cold
frenzies
all
your
own
the
battle
of
the
rivers
broke
who
have
no
faith
a
man
could
mourn
nor
freedom
any
man
desires
but
in
a
new
clean
light
of
scorn
close
up
my
quarrel
with
my
sires
who
bring
my
english
heart
to
me
who
mend
me
like
a
broken
toy
till
i
can
see
you
fight
and
flee
and
laugh
as
if
i
were
a
boy
the
wife
of
flanders
low
and
brown
barns
thatched
and
repatched
and
tattered
where
i
had
seven
sons
until
a
little
hill
of
hay
your
spur
has
scattered
this
is
not
paris
you
have
lost
the
way
you
staring
at
your
sword
to
find
it
brittle
surprised
at
the
surprise
that
was
your
plan
who
shaking
and
breaking
barriers
not
a
little
find
never
more
the
of
sedan
must
i
for
more
than
carnage
call
you
claimant
paying
you
a
penny
for
each
son
you
slay
man
the
whole
globe
in
gold
were
no
repayment
for
what
have
lost
and
how
shall
i
repay
what
is
the
price
of
that
red
spark
that
caught
me
from
a
kind
farm
that
never
had
a
name
what
is
the
price
of
that
dead
man
they
brought
me
for
other
dead
men
do
not
look
the
same
how
should
i
pay
for
one
poor
graven
steeple
whereon
you
shattered
what
you
shall
not
know
how
should
i
pay
you
miserable
people
how
should
i
pay
you
everything
you
owe
unhappy
can
i
give
you
back
your
honour
though
i
forgave
would
any
man
forget
while
all
the
great
green
land
has
trampled
on
her
the
treason
and
terror
of
the
night
we
met
not
any
more
in
vengeance
or
in
pardon
an
old
wife
bargains
for
a
bean
that
hers
you
have
no
word
to
break
no
heart
to
harden
ride
on
and
prosper
you
have
lost
your
spurs
the
crusader
returns
from
captivity
i
have
come
forth
alive
from
the
land
of
purple
and
poison
and
glamour
where
the
charm
is
strong
as
the
torture
being
chosen
to
change
the
mind
torture
of
wordless
dance
and
wineless
feast
without
clamour
palace
hidden
in
palace
garden
with
garden
behind
women
veiled
in
the
sun
or
bare
as
brass
in
the
shadows
and
the
endless
eyeless
patterns
where
each
thing
seems
an
eye
and
my
stride
is
on
caesar
sand
where
it
slides
to
the
english
meadows
to
the
last
low
woods
of
sussex
and
the
road
that
goes
to
rye
in
the
cool
and
careless
woods
the
eyes
of
the
eunuchs
burned
not
but
the
wild
hawk
went
before
me
being
free
to
return
or
roam
the
hills
had
broad
unconscious
backs
and
the
turned
not
and
the
huts
were
heedless
of
me
and
i
knew
i
was
at
home
and
i
saw
my
lady
afar
and
her
holy
freedom
upon
her
a
head
without
veil
averted
and
not
to
be
turned
with
charms
and
i
heard
above
bannerets
blown
the
intolerant
trumpets
of
honour
that
usher
with
iron
laughter
the
coming
of
christian
arms
my
shield
hangs
stainless
still
but
i
shall
not
go
where
they
praise
it
a
sword
is
still
at
my
side
but
i
shall
not
ride
with
the
king
only
to
walk
and
to
walk
and
to
stun
my
soul
and
amaze
it
a
day
with
the
stone
and
the
sparrow
and
every
marvellous
thing
i
have
trod
the
curves
of
the
crescent
in
the
maze
of
them
that
adore
it
curved
around
doorless
chambers
and
unbeholden
abodes
but
i
walk
in
the
maze
no
more
on
the
sign
of
the
cross
i
swore
it
the
wild
white
cross
of
freedom
the
sign
of
the
white
and
the
land
shall
leave
me
or
take
and
the
woman
take
me
or
leave
me
there
shall
be
no
more
night
or
nightmares
seen
in
a
glass
but
life
shall
hold
me
alive
and
death
shall
never
deceive
me
as
long
as
i
walk
in
england
in
the
lanes
that
let
me
pass
iii
love
poems
glencoe
the
cliffs
seem
hinged
upon
the
sky
the
clouds
are
floating
rags
across
them
curled
they
open
to
us
like
the
gates
of
god
cloven
in
the
last
great
wall
of
all
the
world
i
looked
and
saw
the
valley
of
my
soul
where
naked
crests
fight
to
achieve
the
skies
where
no
grain
grows
nor
wine
no
fruitful
thing
only
big
words
and
starry
blasphemies
but
you
have
clothed
with
mercy
like
a
moss
the
barren
violence
of
its
primal
wars
sterile
although
they
be
and
void
of
rule
you
know
my
shapeless
crags
have
wed
the
stars
how
shall
i
thank
you
o
courageous
heart
that
of
this
wasteful
world
you
had
no
fear
but
bade
it
blossom
in
clear
faith
and
sent
your
fair
rivers
even
as
here
the
peat
burns
brimming
from
their
cups
of
stone
glow
brown
and
down
the
vast
decline
as
if
christ
stood
on
yonder
clouded
peak
and
turned
its
thousand
waters
into
wine
love
trappist
there
is
a
place
where
lute
and
lyre
are
broken
where
scrolls
are
torn
and
on
a
wild
wind
go
where
tablets
stand
wiped
naked
for
a
token
where
laurels
wither
and
the
daisies
grow
lo
i
too
join
the
brotherhood
of
silence
i
am
love
trappist
and
you
ask
in
vain
for
man
through
love
gate
even
as
through
death
gate
goeth
alone
and
comes
not
back
again
yet
here
i
pause
look
back
across
the
threshold
cry
to
my
brethren
though
the
world
be
old
prophets
and
sages
questioners
and
doubters
o
world
old
world
the
best
hath
been
told
confessional
now
that
i
kneel
at
the
throne
o
queen
pity
and
pardon
me
much
have
i
striven
to
sing
the
same
brother
of
beast
and
tree
yet
when
the
stars
catch
me
alone
never
a
linnet
sings
and
the
blood
of
a
man
is
a
bitter
voice
and
cries
for
foolish
things
not
for
me
be
the
vaunt
of
woe
was
not
i
from
a
boy
vowed
with
the
helmet
and
spear
and
spur
to
the
banner
of
joy
a
man
may
sing
his
psalms
to
a
stone
pour
his
blood
for
a
weed
but
the
tears
of
a
man
are
a
sudden
thing
and
come
not
of
his
creed
nay
but
the
earth
is
kind
to
me
though
i
cry
for
a
star
leaves
and
grasses
feather
and
flower
cover
the
foolish
scar
prophets
and
saints
and
seraphim
lighten
the
load
with
song
and
the
heart
of
a
man
is
a
heavy
load
for
a
man
to
bear
along
music
sounding
brass
and
tinkling
cymbal
he
that
made
me
sealed
my
ears
and
the
pomp
of
gorgeous
noises
waves
of
triumph
waves
of
tears
thundered
empty
round
and
past
me
shattered
lost
for
ever
more
ancient
gold
of
pride
and
passion
wrecked
like
treasure
on
a
shore
but
i
saw
her
cheek
and
forehead
change
as
at
a
spoken
word
and
i
saw
her
head
uplifted
like
a
lily
to
the
lord
nought
is
lost
but
all
transmuted
ears
are
sealed
yet
eyes
have
seen
saw
her
smiles
o
soul
be
worthy
saw
her
tears
o
heart
be
clean
the
deluge
though
giant
rains
put
out
the
sun
here
stand
i
for
a
sign
though
earth
be
filled
with
waters
dark
my
cup
is
filled
with
wine
tell
to
the
trembling
priests
that
here
under
the
deluge
rod
one
nameless
tattered
broken
man
stood
up
and
drank
to
god
sun
has
been
where
the
rain
is
now
bees
in
the
heat
to
hum
haply
a
humming
maiden
came
now
let
the
deluge
come
brown
of
aureole
green
of
garb
straight
as
a
golden
rod
drink
to
the
throne
of
thunder
now
drink
to
the
wrath
of
god
high
in
the
wreck
i
held
the
cup
i
clutched
my
rusty
sword
i
cocked
my
tattered
feather
to
the
glory
of
the
lord
not
undone
were
the
heaven
and
earth
this
hollow
world
thrown
up
before
one
man
had
stood
up
straight
and
drained
it
like
a
cup
the
strange
music
other
loves
may
sink
and
settle
other
loves
may
loose
and
slack
but
i
wander
like
a
minstrel
with
a
harp
upon
his
back
though
the
harp
be
on
my
bosom
though
i
finger
and
i
fret
still
my
hope
is
all
before
me
for
i
can
not
play
it
yet
in
your
strings
is
hid
a
music
that
no
hand
hath
ere
let
fall
in
your
soul
is
sealed
a
pleasure
that
you
have
not
known
at
all
pleasure
subtle
as
your
spirit
strange
and
slender
as
your
frame
fiercer
than
the
pain
that
folds
you
softer
than
your
sorrow
name
not
as
mine
my
soul
anointed
not
as
mine
the
rude
and
light
easy
mirth
of
many
faces
swaggering
pride
of
song
and
fight
something
stranger
something
sweeter
something
waiting
you
afar
secret
as
your
stricken
senses
magic
as
your
sorrows
are
but
on
this
god
harp
supernal
stretched
but
to
be
stricken
once
hoary
time
is
a
beginner
life
a
bungler
death
a
dunce
but
i
will
not
fear
to
match
them
no
by
god
i
will
not
fear
i
will
learn
you
i
will
play
you
and
the
stars
stand
still
to
hear
the
great
minimum
it
is
something
to
have
wept
as
we
have
wept
it
is
something
to
have
done
as
we
have
done
it
is
something
to
have
watched
when
all
men
slept
and
seen
the
stars
which
never
see
the
sun
it
is
something
to
have
smelt
the
mystic
rose
although
it
break
and
leave
the
thorny
rods
it
is
something
to
have
hungered
once
as
those
must
hunger
who
have
ate
the
bread
of
gods
to
have
seen
you
and
your
unforgotten
face
brave
as
a
blast
of
trumpets
for
the
fray
pure
as
white
lilies
in
a
watery
space
it
were
something
though
you
went
from
me
to
have
known
the
things
that
from
the
weak
are
furled
perilous
ancient
passions
strange
and
high
it
is
something
to
be
wiser
than
the
world
it
is
something
to
be
older
than
the
sky
in
a
time
of
sceptic
moths
and
cynic
rusts
and
fatted
lives
that
of
their
sweetness
tire
in
a
world
of
flying
loves
and
fading
lusts
it
is
something
to
be
sure
of
a
desire
lo
blessed
are
our
ears
for
they
have
heard
yea
blessed
are
our
eyes
for
they
have
seen
let
thunder
break
on
man
and
beast
and
bird
and
the
lightning
it
is
something
to
have
been
the
mortal
answers
away
with
the
fairies
hand
in
hand
for
the
world
is
more
full
of
weeping
than
you
can
understand
from
the
wood
of
the
old
wives
fables
they
glittered
out
of
the
grey
and
with
all
the
armies
of
i
strove
like
a
beast
at
bay
with
only
a
right
arm
wearied
only
a
red
sword
worn
and
the
pride
of
the
house
of
adam
that
holdeth
the
stars
in
scorn
for
they
came
with
chains
of
flowers
and
lilies
lances
free
there
in
the
quiet
greenwood
to
take
my
grief
from
me
and
i
said
now
all
is
shaken
when
heavily
hangs
the
brow
when
the
hope
of
the
years
is
taken
the
last
star
sunken
now
hear
you
chattering
cricket
hear
you
spawn
of
the
sod
the
strange
strong
cry
in
the
darkness
of
one
man
praising
god
that
out
of
the
night
and
nothing
with
travail
of
birth
he
came
to
stand
one
hour
in
the
sunlight
only
to
say
her
name
falls
through
her
hair
the
sunshine
in
showers
it
touches
see
her
high
bright
cheeks
in
turning
ah
elfin
company
the
world
is
hot
and
cruel
we
are
weary
of
heart
and
hand
but
the
world
is
more
full
of
glory
than
you
can
understand
a
marriage
song
why
should
we
reck
of
hours
that
rend
while
we
two
ride
together
the
heavens
rent
from
end
to
end
would
be
but
windy
weather
the
strong
stars
shaken
down
in
spate
would
be
a
shower
of
spring
and
we
should
list
the
trump
of
fate
and
hear
a
linnet
sing
we
break
the
line
with
stroke
and
luck
the
arrows
run
like
rain
if
you
be
struck
or
i
be
struck
there
one
to
strike
again
if
you
befriend
or
i
befriend
the
strength
is
in
us
twain
and
good
things
end
and
bad
things
end
and
you
and
i
remain
why
should
we
reck
of
ill
or
well
while
we
two
ride
together
the
fires
that
over
sodom
fell
would
be
but
sultry
weather
beyond
all
ends
to
all
men
given
our
race
is
far
and
fell
we
shall
but
wash
our
feet
in
heaven
and
warm
our
hands
in
hell
battles
unborn
and
vast
shall
view
our
faltered
standards
stream
new
friends
shall
come
and
frenzies
new
new
troubles
toil
and
teem
new
friends
shall
pass
and
still
renew
one
truth
that
does
not
seem
that
i
am
i
and
you
are
you
and
death
a
morning
dream
why
should
we
reck
of
scorn
or
praise
while
we
two
ride
together
the
icy
air
of
godless
days
shall
be
but
wintry
weather
if
hell
were
highest
if
the
heaven
were
blue
with
devils
blue
i
should
have
guessed
that
all
was
even
if
i
had
dreamed
of
you
little
i
reck
of
empty
prides
of
creeds
more
cold
than
clay
to
nobler
ends
and
longer
rides
my
lady
rides
to
swing
our
swords
and
take
our
sides
in
that
fray
when
stars
fall
down
and
darkness
hides
when
god
shall
turn
to
bay
why
should
we
reck
of
grin
and
groan
while
we
two
ride
together
the
triple
thunders
of
the
throne
would
be
but
stormy
weather
for
us
the
last
great
fight
shall
roar
upon

we
shall
turn

once

our
love

found
the
home
of
my
true
love
who
is
a
wandering
home
for
me
who
lost
in
ruined
worlds
aloof
bore
the
dread
dove
wings
like
a
roof
who
past
the
last
lost
stars
of
space
carried
the
on
her
face
who
passing
as
in
idle
hours
tamed
the
wild
weeds
to
garden
flowers
stroked
the
strange
whirlwind
whirring
wings
and
made
the
comets
homely
things
where
she
went
by
upon
her
way
the
dark
was
dearer
than
the
day
where
she
paused

hell

between

her

in

some

she
may
have

stopped
at

called

kinsfolk
for

jest
if

again
this
little
house
of

before

stars
for
her
here
in
the
fallen
leaves
is
furled
her
secret
centre
of

sit
and

in
dusk
and

the

round
us

a
sun

and
tree
found
the
home
of
my
true
is
a
wandering
home
for
iv
religious
poems
the
wise
men
step
softly
under
snow
or
rain
to
find
the
place
where
men
can
pray
the
way
is
all
so
very
plain
that
we
may
lose
the
way
oh
we
have
learnt
to
peer
and
pore
on
tortured
puzzles
from
our
youth
we
know
all
labyrinthine
lore
we
are
the
three
wise
mert
of
yore
and
we
know
all
things
but
the
truth
we
have
gone
round
and
round
the
hill
and
lost
the
wood
among
the
trees
and
learnt
long
names
for
every
ill
and
served
the
mad
gods
naming
still
the
furies
the
eumenides
the
gods
of
violence
took
the
veil
of
vision
and
philosophy
the
serpent
that
brought
all
men
bale
he
bites
his
own
accursed
tail
and
calls
himself
eternity
go
humbly
it
has
hailed
and
snowed
with
voices
low
and
lanterns
lit
so
very
simple
is
the
road
that
we
may
stray
from
it
the
world
grows
terrible
and
white
and
blinding
white
the
breaking
day
we
walk
bewildered
in
the
light
for
something
is
too
large
for
sight
and
something
much
too
plain
to
say
the
child
that
was
ere
worlds
begun
we
need
but
walk
a
little
way
we
need
but
see
a
latch
undone
the
child
that
played
with
moon
and
sun
is
playing
with
a
little
hay
the
house
from
which
the
heavens
are
fed
the
old
strange
house
that
is
our
own
where
tricks
of
words
are
never
said
and
mercy
is
as
plain
as
bread
and
honour
is
as
hard
as
stone
go
humbly
humble
are
the
skies
and
low
and
large
and
fierce
the
star
so
very
near
the
manger
lies
that
we
may
travel
far
hark
laughter
like
a
lion
wakes
to
roar
to
the
resounding
plain
and
the
whole
heaven
shouts
and
shakes
for
god
himself
is
born
again
and
we
are
little
children
walking
through
the
snow
and
rain
the
house
of
christmas
there
fared
a
mother
driven
forth
out
of
an
inn
to
roam
in
the
place
where
she
was
homeless
all
men
are
at
home
the
crazy
stable
close
at
hand
with
shaking
timber
and
shifting
sand
grew
a
stronger
thing
to
abide
and
stand
than
the
square
stones
of
rome
for
men
are
homesick
in
their
homes
and
strangers
under
the
sun
and
they
lay
their
heads
in
a
foreign
land
whenever
the
day
is
done
here
we
have
battle
and
blazing
eyes
and
chance
and
honour
and
high
surprise
where
the
yule
tale
was
begun
a
child
in
a
foul
stable
where
the
beasts
feed
and
foam
only
where
he
was
homeless
are
you
and
i
at
home
we
have
hands
that
fashion
and
heads
that
but
our
hearts
we
lost
how
long
ago
in
a
place
no
chart
nor
ship
can
show
under
the
sky
dome
this
world
is
wild
as
an
old
wives
tale
and
strange
the
plain
things
are
the
earth
is
enough
and
the
air
is
enough
for
our
wonder
and
our
war
but
our
rest
is
as
far
as
the
swings
and
our
peace
is
put
in
impossible
things
where
clashed
and
thundered
unthinkable
wings
round
an
incredible
star
to
an
open
house
in
the
evening
home
shall
men
come
to
an
older
place
than
eden
and
a
taller
town
than
rome
to
the
end
of
the
way
of
the
wandering
star
to
the
things
that
can
not
be
and
that
are
to
the
place
where
god
was
homeless
and
all
men
are
at
home
a
song
of
gifts
to
god
when
the
first
christmas
presents
came
the
straw
where
christ
was
rolled
smelt
sweeter
than
their
frankincense
burnt
brighter
than
their
gold
and
a
wise
man
said
we
will
not
give
the
thanks
would
be
but
cold
nay
said
the
next
to
all
new
gifts
to
this
gift
or
another
bends
the
high
gratitude
of
god
even
as
he
now
my
brother
who
had
a
father
for
all
time
yet
thanks
him
for
a
mother
yet
scarce
for
him
this
yellow
stone
or
and
sparse
who
holds
the
gold
heart
of
the
sun
that
fed
these
timber
bars
nor
any
scentless
lily
lives
for
one
that
smells
the
stars
then
spake
the
third
of
the
wise
men
the
wisest
of
the
three
we
may
not
with
the
widest
lives
enlarge
his
liberty
whose
wings
are
wider
than
the
world
it
is
not
he
but
we
we
say
not
he
has
more
to
gain
but
we
have
more
to
lose
less
gold
shall
go
astray
we
say
less
gold
if
thus
we
choose
go
to
make
harlots
of
the
greeks
and
hucksters
of
the
jews
less
clouds
before
colossal
feet
redden
in
the
to
the
blind
gods
from
babylon
less
incense
burn
to
the
high
beasts
of
babylon
whose
mouths
make
mock
of
right
babe
of
the
thousand
birthdays
we
that
are
young
yet
grey
white
with
the
centuries
still
can
find
no
better
thing
to
say
we
that
with
sects
and
whims
and
wars
have
wasted
christmas
day
light
thou
thy
censer
to
thyself
for
all
our
fires
are
dim
stamp
thou
thine
image
on
our
coin
for
caesar
face
grows
dim
and
a
dumb
devil
of
pride
and
greed
has
taken
hold
of
him
we
bring
thee
back
great
christendom
churches
and
towns
and
towers
and
if
our
hands
are
glad
o
god
to
cast
them
down
like
flowers
is
not
that
they
enrich
thine
hands
but
they
are
saved
from
ours
the
kingdom
of
heaven
said
the
lord
god
build
a
house
build
it
in
the
gorge
of
death
found
it
in
the
throats
of
hell
where
the
lost
sea
muttereth
fires
and
whirlwinds
build
it
well
laboured
sternly
flame
and
wind
but
a
little
and
they
cry
lord
we
doubt
of
this
thy
will
we
are
blind
and
murmur
why
and
the
winds
are
murmuring
still
said
the
lord
god
build
a
house
cleave
its
treasure
from
the
earth
with
the
jarring
powers
of
hell
strive
with
formless
might
and
mirth
tribes
and
build
it
well
then
the
raw
red
sons
of
men
brake
the
soil
and
lopped
the
wood
but
a
little
and
they
shrill
lord
we
can
not
view
thy
good
and
the
wild
men
clamour
still
said
the
lord
god
build
a
house
smoke
and
iron
spark
and
steam
speak
and
vote
and
buy
and
sell
let
a
new
world
throb
and
stream
seers
and
makers
build
it
well
strove
the
cunning
men
and
strong
but
a
little
and
they
cry
lord
mayhap
we
are
but
clay
and
we
can
not
know
the
why
and
the
wise
men
doubt
yet
though
worn
and
deaf
and
blind
force
and
savage
king
and
seer
labour
still
they
know
not
why
at
the
dim
foundation
here
knead
and
plough
and
think
and
ply
till
at
last
mayhap
hereon
fused
of
passion
and
accord
love
its
crown
and
peace
its
stay
rise
the
city
of
the
lord
that
we
darkly
build
a
hymn
for
the
church
militant
great
god
that
bowest
sky
and
star
bow
down
our
towering
thoughts
to
thee
and
grant
us
in
a
faltering
war
the
firm
feet
of
humility
lord
we
that
snatch
the
swords
of
flame
lord
we
that
cry
about
thy
car
we
too
are
weak
with
pride
and
shame
we
too
are
as
our
foemen
are
yea
we
are
mad
as
they
are
mad
yea
we
are
blind
as
they
are
blind
yea
we
are
very
sick
and
sad
who
bring
good
news
to
all
mankind
the
dreadful
joy
thy
son
has
sent
is
heavier
than
any
care
we
find
as
cain
his
punishment
our
pardon
more
than
we
can
bear
lord
when
we
cry
thee
far
and
near
and
thunder
through
all
lands
unknown
the
gospel
into
every
ear
lord
let
us
not
forget
our
own
cleanse
us
from
ire
of
creed
or
class
the
anger
of
the
idle
tings
sow
in
our
souls
like
living
grass
the
laughter
of
all
lowly
things
the
beatific
vision
then
bernard
smiled
at
me
that
i
should
gaze
but
i
had
gazed
already
caught
the
view
faced
the
unfathomable
ray
of
rays
which
to
itself
and
by
itself
is
true
then
was
my
vision
mightier
than
man
speech
speech
snapt
before
it
like
a
flying
spell
and
memory
and
all
that
time
can
teach
before
that
splendid
outrage
failed
and
fell
as
when
one
dreameth
and
remembereth
not
waking
what
were
his
pleasures
or
his
pains
with
every
feature
of
the
dream
forgot
the
printed
passion
of
the
dream
remains
even
such
am
i
within
whose
thoughts
resides
no
picture
of
that
sight
nor
any
part
nor
any
memory
in
whom
abides
only
a
happiness
within
the
heart
a
secret
happiness
that
soaks
the
heart
as
hills
are
soaked
by
slow
unsealing
snow
or
secret
as
that
wind
without
a
chart
whereon
did
the
wild
leaves
of
sibyl
go
o
light
uplifted
from
all
mortal
knowing
send
back
a
little
of
that
glimpse
of
thee
that
of
its
glory
i
may
kindle
glowing
one
tiny
spark
for
all
men
yet
to
be
the
truce
of
christmas
passionate
peace
is
in
the
sky
and
in
the
snow
in
silver
sealed
the
beasts
are
perfect
in
the
field
and
men
seem
men
so
suddenly
but
take
ten
swords
and
ten
times
ten
and
blow
the
bugle
in
praising
men
for
we
are
for
all
men
under
the
sun
and
they
are
against
us
every
one
and
misers
haggle
and
madmen
clutch
and
there
is
peril
in
praising
much
and
we
have
the
terrible
tongues
uncurled
that
praise
the
world
to
the
sons
of
the
world
the
idle
humble
hill
and
wood
are
bowed
upon
the
sacred
birth
and
for
one
little
hour
the
earth
is
lazy
with
the
love
of
good
but
ready
are
you
and
ready
am
i
if
the
battle
blow
and
the
guns
go
by
for
we
are
for
all
men
under
the
sun
and
they
are
against
us
every
one
and
the
men
that
hate
herd
all
together
to
pride
and
gold
and
the
great
white
feather
and
the
thing
is
graven
in
star
and
stone
that
the
men
who
love
are
all
alone
hunger
is
hard
and
time
is
tough
but
bless
the
beggars
and
kiss
the
kings
for
hope
has
broken
the
heart
of
things
and
nothing
was
ever
praised
enough
but
bold
the
shield
for
a
sudden
swing
and
point
the
sword
when
you
praise
a
thing
for
we
are
for
all
men
under
the
sun
and
they
are
against
us
every
one
and
mime
and
merchant
thane
and
thrall
hate
us
because
we
love
them
all
only
till
christmastide
go
by
passionate
peace
is
in
the
sky
a
hymn
o
god
of
earth
and
altar
bow
down
and
hear
our
cry
our
earthly
rulers
falter
our
people
drift
and
die
the
walls
of
gold
entomb
us
the
swords
of
scorn
divide
take
not
thy
thunder
from
us
but
take
away
our
pride
from
all
that
terror
teaches
from
lies
of
tongue
and
pen
from
all
the
easy
speeches
that
comfort
cruel
men
from
sale
and
profanation
of
honour
and
the

from
sleep
and
from
damnation
deliver
us
good
lord
tie
in
a
living
tether
the
prince
and
priest
and
thrall

all
our
lives
together
smite
us
and

us
all
in
ire
and
exultation
aflame
with
faith
and
free
lift
up
a
living

a
single

to
thee
a
christmas
song
for
three
guilds
to
be
sung
a
long
time
ago
or
hence
joseph
to
the
carpenters
said
on
a
christmas
day
the
master
shall
have
patience
and
the
prentice
shall
obey
and
your
word
unto
your
women
shall
be
nowise
hard
or
wild
for
the
sake
of
me
your
master
who
have
worshipped
wife
and
child
but
softly
you
shall
frame
the
fence
and
softly
carve
the
door
and
softly
plane
the
table
as
to
spread
it
for
the
poor
and
all
your
thoughts
be
soft
and
white
as
the
wood
of
the
white
tree
but
if
they
tear
the
charter
jet
the
tocsin
speak
for
me
let
the
wooden
sign
above
your
shop
be
prouder
to
be
scarred
than
the
of
lancelot
that
hung
at
joyous
garde
crispin
to
the
shoemakers
said
on
a
christmastide
who
fashions
at
another
feet
will
get
no
good
of
pride
they
were
bleeding
on
the
mountain
the
feet
that
brought
good
news
the
latchet
of
whose
shoes
we
were
not
worthy
to
unloose
see
that
your
feet
offend
not
nor
lightly
lift
your
head
tread
softly
on
the
sunlit
roads
the
bright
dust
of
the
dead
let
your
own
feet
be
shod
with
peace
be
lowly
all
your
lives
but
if
they
touch
the
charter
ye
shall
nail
it
with
your
knives
and
the
of
the
commons
drive
in
all
as
dense
array
as
once
a
crash
of
arrows
came
upon
crispin
day
luke
unto
the
painters
on
christmas
day
he
said
see
that
the
robes
are
white
you
dare
to
dip
in
gold
and
red
for
only
gold
the
kings
can
give
and
only
blood
the
saints
and
his
high
task
grows
perilous
that
mixes
them
in
paints
keep
you
the
ancient
order
follow
the
men
that
knew
the
labyrinth
of
black
and
whits
the
maze
of
green
and
blue
paint
mighty
things
paint
paltry
things
paint
silly
things
or
sweet
but
if
men
break
the
charter
you
may
slay
them
in
the
street
and
if
you
paint
one
post
for
them
then
but
you
know
it
well
you
paint
a
harlot
face
to
drag
all
heroes
down
to
hell
almighty
god
to
all
mankind
on
christmas
day
said
he
i
rent
you
from
the
old
red
hills
and
rending
made
you
free
there
was
charter
there
was
challenge
in
a
blast
of
breath
i
gave
you
can
be
all
things
other
you
can
not
be
a
slave
you
shall
be
tired
and
tolerant
of
fancies
as
they

if
men
doubt
the
charter
ye
shall
call
on
the
crusade
trumpet
and
torch
and
catapult
cannon
and
bow
and
blade
because
it
was
my
challenge
to
all
the
things
i
made
the
nativity
the
thatch
on
the
roof
was
as
golden
though
dusty
the
straw
was
and
old
the
wind
had
a
peal
as
of
trumpets
though
blowing
and
barren
and
cold
the
mother
hair
was
a
glory
though
loosened
and
torn
for
under
the
eaves
in
the
gloaming
a
child
was
born
have
a
myriad
children
been
quickened
have
a
myriad
children
grown
old
grown
gross
and
unloved
and
embittered
grown
cunning
and
savage
and
cold
god
abides
in
a
terrible
patience
unangered
unworn
and
again
for
the
child
that
was
squandered
a
child
is
born
what
know
we
of
æons
behind
us
dim
dynasties
lost
long
ago
huge
empires
like
dreams
unremembered
huge
cities
for
ages
laid
low
this
at
least
that
with
blight
and
with
blessing
with
flower
and
with
thorn
love
was
there
and
his
cry
was
among
them
a
child
is
born
though
the
darkness
be
noisy
with
systems
dark
fancies
that
fret
and
disprove
still
the
plumes
stir
around
us
above
us
the
wings
of
the
shadow
of
love
oh
princes
and
priests
have
ye
seen
it
grow
pale
through
your
scorn
huge
dawns
sleep
before
us
deep
changes
a
child
is
born
and
the
rafters
of
toil
still
are
gilded
with
the
dawn
of
the
star
of
the
heart
and
the
wise
men
draw
near
in
the
twilight
who
are
weary
of
learning
and
art
and
the
face
of
the
tyrant
is
darkened
his
spirit
is
torn
for
a
new
king
is
enthroned
yea
the
sternest
a
child
is
born
and
the
mother
still
joys
for
the
whispered
first
stir
of
unspeakable
things
still
feels
that
high
moment
unfurling
red
glory
of
gabriel
wings
still
the
babe
of
an
hour
is
a
master
whom
angels
adorn
emmanuel
prophet
anointed
a
child
is
born
and
thou
that
art
still
in
thy
cradle
the
sun
being
crown
for
thy
brow
make
answer
our
flesh
make
an
answer
say
whence
art
thou
come
who
art
thou
art
thou
come
back
on
earth
for
our
teaching
to
train
or
to
warn
hush
how
may
we
know
knowing
only
a
child
is
born
a
child
of
the
snows
there
is
heard
a
hymn
when
the
panes
dim
and
never
before
or
again
when
the
nights
are
strong
with
a
darkness
long
and
the
dark
is
alive
with
rain
never
we
know
but
in
sleet
and
in
snow
the
place
where
the
great
fires
are
that
the
midst
of
the
earth
is
a
raging
mirth
and
the
heart
of
the
earth
a
star
and
at
night
we
win
to
the
ancient
inn
where
the
child
in
the
frost
is
furled
we
follow
the
feet
where
all
souls
meet
at
the
inn
at
the
end
of
the
world
the
gods
lie
dead
where
the
leaves
lie
red
for
the
flame
of
the
sun
is
flown
the
gods
lie
cold
where
the
leaves
lie
gold
and
a
child
comes
forth
alone
a
word
a
word
came
forth
in
galilee
a
word
like
to
a
star
it
climbed
and
rang
and
blessed
and
burnt
wherever
brave
hearts
are
a
word
of
sudden
secret
hope
of
trial
and
increase
of
wrath
and
pity
fused
in
fire
and
passion
kissing
peace
a
star
that
the
citied
world
beckoned
a
sword
of
flame
a
star
with
myriad
thunders
tongued
a
mighty
word
there
came
the
wedge
dart
passed
into
it
the
groan
of
timberwains
the
ringing
of
the
rivet
nails
the
shrieking
of
the
planes
the
hammering
on
the
roofs
at
morn
the
busy
workshop
roar
the
hiss
of
shavings
drifted
deep
along
the
windy
floor
the
toiler
crooning
song
the
hum
of
human
worth
mingled
of
all
the
noise
of
crafts
the
ringing
word
went
forth
the
splash
of
nets
passed
into
it
the
grind
of
sand
and
shell
the
clash
the
jar
the
cries
to
buy
and
sell
the
flapping
of
the
landed
shoals
the
canvas
crackling
free
and
through
all
varied
notes
and
cries
the
roaring
of
the
sea
the
noise
of
little
lives
and
brave
of
needy
lives
and
high
in
gathering
all
the
throes
of
earth
the
living
word
went
by
earth
giant
sins
bowed
down
to
it
in
empire
huge
eclipse
when
darkness
sat
above
the
thrones
seven
thunders
on
her
lips
the
woe
of
cities
entered
it
the
clang
of
idols
falls
the
scream
of
filthy
caesars
stabbed
high
in
their
brazen
halls
the
dim
hoarse
hoods
of
naked
men
the
worldrealms
snapping
girth
the
trumpets
of
apocalypse
the
darkness
of
the
earth
the
wrath
that
brake
the
eternal
lamp
and
hid
the
eternal
hill
a
world
destruction
loading
the
word
went
onward
still
the
blaze
of
creeds
passed
into
it
the
hiss
of
horrid
fires
the
headlong
spear
the
scarlet
cross
the
and
the
briars
the
cloistered
brethren
thunderous
chaunt
the
errant

the
shifting
of
the
crowns
and

the
tangle
of
the
strong
the
shattering
fall
of
crest
and
crown
and
shield
and
cross
and
cope
the
tearing
of
the
gauds
of

the
blight
of

the
reign
of
ragged
millions
leagued
to
wrench
a
loaded
debt
loud
with
the
many
throated
roar
the
word
went
forward
yet
the
song
of
wheels
passed
into
it
the
roaring
and
the
smoke
the
riddle
of
the
want
and
wage
the
fogs
that
burn
and
choke
the
breaking
of
the
girths
of

the

that
creep

the

the

of
christian

chuck
it
smith
the
revolutionist
or
lines
to
a
statesman
i
was
never
standing
by
while
a
revolution
was
going
on
by
the
rt
hon
walter
when
death
was
on
thy
drums
democracy
and
with
one
rush
of
slaves
the
world
was
free
in
that
high
dawn
that
kings
shall
not
forget
a
void
there
was
and
walter
was
not
yet
through
sacked
versailles
at
valmy
in
the
fray
they
did
without
him
in
some
kind
of
way
red
christendom
all
walterless
they
cross
and
in
their
fury
hardly
feel
their
loss
fades
the
republic
faint
as
roland
horn
her
trumpets
taunt
us
with
a
sacred
scorn
then
silence
fell
and
long
was
born
from
his
first
hours
in
his
expensive
cot
he
never
saw
the
tiniest
viscount
shot
in
deference
to
his
wealthy
parents
whim
the
wildest
massacres
were
kept
from
him
the
wars
that
dyed
pall
mall
and
brompton
red
passed
harmless
that
one
unconscious
head
for
all
that
little
long
could
understand
the
rich
might
still
be
rulers
of
the
land
vain
are
the
pious
arts
of
parenthood
foiled
revolution
bubbled
in
his
blood
until
one
day
the
babe
unborn
shall
rue
it
the
constitution
bored
him
and
he
slew
it
if
i
were
wise
and
good
and
rich
and
strong
fond
impious
thought
if
i
were
walter
long
if
i
could
water
sell
like
molten
gold
and
make
grown
people
do
as
they
are
told
if
over
private
fields
and
wastes
as
wide
as
a
greek
city
for
which
heroes
died
i
owned
the
houses
and
the
men
inside
if
all
this
hung
on
one
thin
thread
of
habit
i
would
not
revolutionize
a
rabbit
i
would
sit
tight
with
all
my
gifts
and
glories
and
even
preach
to
unconverted
tories
that
the
fixed
system
that
our
land
inherits
viewed
from
a
certain
standpoint
has
its
merits
i
guard
the
laws
like
any
radical
and
keep
each
precedent
however
small
however
subtle
misty
dusty
dreamy
lest
man
by
chance
should
look
at
me
and
see
me
lest
men
should
ask
what
madman
made
me
lord
of
english
ploughshares
and
the
english
sword
lest
men
should
mark
how
sleepy
is
the
nod
that
drills
the
dreadful
images
of
god
walter
be
wise
avoid
the
wild
and
new
the
constitution
is
the
game
for
you
walter
beware
scorn
not
the
gathering
throng
it
suffers
yet
it
may
not
suffer
wrong
it
suffers
yet
it
can
not
suffer
long
and
if
you
goad
it
these
grey
rules
to
break
for
a
few
pence
see
that
you
do
not
wake
death
and
the
splendour
of
the
scarlet
cap
boston
and
valmy
yorktown
and
jemmappes
freedom
in
arms
the
riding
and
the
routing
the
thunder
of
the
captains
and
the
shouting
all
that
lost
riot
that
you
did
not
share
and
when
that
riot
comes
you
be
there
the
shakespeare
memorial
lord
lilac
thought
it
rather
rotten
that
shakespeare
should
be
quite
and
therefore
got
on
a
committee
with
several
chaps
out
of
the
city
and
shorter
and
sir
herbert
tree
lord
rothschild
and
lord
rosebery
and
and
comyns
carr
two
dukes
and
a
dramatic
star
also
a
clergyman
now
dead
and
while
the
vain
world
careless
sped
unheeding
the
heroic
name
the
souls
most
fed
with
shakespeare
flame
still
sat
unconquered
in
a
ring
remembering
him
like
anything
lord
lilac
did
not
long
remain
lord
lilac
did
not
come
again
he
softly
lit
a
cigarette
and
sought
some
other
social
set
where
in
some
other
knots
or
rings
people
were
doing
cultured
things
miss
zwilt
humane
vivarium
the
little
men
that
paint
on
gum
the
exquisite
gorilla
girl
he
sometimes
in
this
giddy
whirl
not
being
really
bad
at
heart
remembered
shakespeare
with
a
start
but
not
with
that
grand
constancy
of
clement
shorter
herbert
tree
lord
rosebery
and
comyns
carr
and
all
the
other
names
there
are
who
stuck
like
limpets
to
the
spot
lest
they
forgot
lest
they
forgot
lord
lilac
was
of
slighter
stuff
lord
lilac
had
had
quite
enough
the
horrible
history
of
jones
jones
had
a
dog
it
had
a
chain
not
often
worn
not
causing
pain
but
as
the
had
passed
their
unleashed
cousins
act
at
last
inspectors
took
the
chain
away
whereat
the
canine
barked
hurray
at
which
of
course
the
whose
nervous
motorists
bill
was
through
were
forced
to
give
the
dog
in
charge
for
being
audibly
at
large
none
you
will
say
were
now
annoyed
save
haply
jones
the
yard
was
void
but
something
being
in
the
lease
about
alarms
to
aid
police
the
annexed
the
yard
for
having
no
sufficient
guards
now
if
there
one
condition
the
are
strong
upon
it
is
that
every
house
one
buys
must
have
a
yard
for
exercise
so
jones
as
tenant
was
unfit
his
state
of
health
was
proof
of
it
two
doctors
of
the
told
him
his
legs
from
long
disuse
were
atrophied
and
saying
so
from
step
to
higher
step
we
go
till
everything
is
new
and
true
they
cut
his
legs
off
and
withdrew
you
know
the
views
are
stronger
than
the
and
soon
as
one
may
say
took
wing
the
arms
though
not
the
man
i
sing
to
see
him
sitting
limbless
there
was
more
than
the
could
bear
in
mercy
silence
with
all
speed
that
mouth
there
are
no
hands
to
feed
what
cruel
sentimentalist
o
jones
would
doom
thee
to
exist
clinging
to
selfish
selfhood
yet
weak
one
such
reasoning
might
upset
the
pump
act
and
the
accumulation
of
all
constructive
legislation
let
us
construct
you
up
a
bit
the
head
fell
off
when
it
was
hit
then
words
did
rise
and
honest
doubt
and
four
commissions
sat
about
whether
the
slash
that
left
him
dead
cut
off
his
body
or
his
head
an
author
in
the
isle
of
wight
observed
with
unconcealed
delight
a
land
of
old
and
just
renown
where
freedom
slowly
broadened
down
from
precedent
to
precedent
and
this
i
think
was
what
he
meant
the
new
freethinker
john
grubby
who
was
short
and
stout
and
troubled
with
religious
doubt
refused
about
the
age
of
three
to
sit
upon
the
curate
knee
for
so
the
eternal
strife
must
rage
between
the
spirit
of
the
age
and
dogma
which
as
is
well
known
does
simply
hate
to
be
outgrown
grubby
the
young
idea
that
shoots
outgrew
the
ages
like
old
boots
while
still
to
all
appearance
small
would
have
no
miracles
at
all
and
just
before
the
age
of
ten
firmly
refused
free
will
to
men
the
altars
reeled
the
shook
just
as
he
read
of
in
the
book
flung
from
his
house
went
forth
the
youth
alone
with
tempests
and
the
truth
up
to
the
distant
city
and
dim
where
his
papa
had
bought
for
him
a
partnership
in
chepe
and
deer
worth
say
twelve
hundred
pounds
a
year
but
he
was
resolute
lord
brute
had
found
him
useful
and
lord
loot
with
whom
few
other
men
would
act
valued
his
promptitude
and
tact
never
did
even
philanthropy
enrich
a
man
more
rapidly
twas
he
that
stopped
the
strike
in
coal
for
hungry
children
racked
his
soul
to
end
their
misery
there
and
then
he
filled
the
mines
with
chinamen
sat
in
that
house
that
broke
the
kings
and
voted
for
all
sores
of
things
and
rose
from
to
sec
some
grumbled
growlers
who
gave
less
than
generous
worship
to
success
the
little
printers
in
dundee
who
got
ten
years
for
blasphemy
although
he
let
them
off
with
seven
respect
him
rather
less
than
heaven
no
matter
this
can
still
be
said
never
to
supernatural
dread
never
to
unseen
deity
did
sir
john
grubby
bend
the
knee
never
did
dream
of
hell
or
wrath
turn
viscount
grubby
from
his
path
nor
was
he
bribed
by
fabled
bliss
to
kneel
to
any
world
but
this
the
curate
lives
in
camden
town
his
lap
still
empty
of
renown
and
still
across
the
waste
of
years
john
grubby
in
the
house
of
peers
faces
that
curate
proud
and
free
and
never
sits
upon
his
knee
in
memoriam
nice
january
if
any
in
an
island
cradle
curled
of
comfort
may
make
offerings
to
you
who
in
the
day
of
all
denial
blew
a
bugle
through
the
blackness
of
the
world
an
english
hand
would
touch
your
shroud
in
trust
that
truth
again
be
told
in
english
speech
and
we
too
yet
may
practise
what
we
preach
though
it
were
practising
the
bayonet
thrust
cutting
that
giant
neck
from
sand
to
sand
from
sea
to
sea
it
was
a
little
thing
beside
your
sudden
shout
and
that
cut
the
throat

with
the
compliments
of
the
season
to
a
popular
leader
much
to
be
congratulated
on
the
avoidance
of
a
strike
at
christmas
i
know
you
you
will
hail
the
huge
release
saying
the
sheathing
of
a
thousand
swords
in
silence
and
injustice
well
accords
with
christmas
bells
and
you
will
gild
with
grease
the
papers
the
employers
the
police
and
vomit
up
the
void
your
windy
words
to
your
new
christ
who
bears
no
whip
of
cords
for
them
that
traffic
in
the

the

i
have
not
failed
to
honour
and
i
say
it
would
be
better
for
such
men
as
we
and
we
be
nearer
bethlehem
it
we
lay
shot
dead
on
scarlet
snows
for
liberty
dead
in
the
daylight
upon
christmas
day
a
song
of
swords
a
drove
of
cattle
came
into
a
village
called
swords
and
was
stopped
by
the
rioters
in
the
place
called
swords
on
the
irish
road
it
is
told
for
a
new
renown
how
we
field
the
horns
of
the
cattle
and
how
we
will
hold
the
horns
of
the
devil
now
ere
the
lord
of
bell
with
the
horn
on
his
brow
is
crowned
in
dublin
town
light
in
the
east
and
light
in
the
west
and
light
on
the
cruel
lords
on
the
souls
that
suddenly
all
men
knew
and
the
green
flag
flew
and
the
red
flag
flew
and
many
a
wheel
of
the
world
stopped
too
when
the
cattle
were
stopped
at
swords
be
they
sinners
or
less
than
saints
that
smite
in
the
street
for
rage
we
know
where
the
shame
shines
bright
we
know
you
that
they
smite
at
you
their
foe
lords
of
the
lawless
wage
and
low
this
is
your
lawful
wage
you
pinched
a
child
to
a
torture
price
that
you
dared
not
name
in
words
so
black
a
jest
was
the
silver
bit
that
your
own
speech
shook
for
the
shame
of
and
the
coward
was
plain
as
a
cow
they
hit
when
the
cattle
have
strayed
at
swords
the
wheel
of
the
torment
of
wives
went
round
to
break
men
brotherhood
you
gave
the
good
irish
blood
to
grease
the
clubs
of
your
country
enemies
you
saw
the
brave
man
beat
to
the
knees
and
you
saw
that
it
was
good
the
rope
of
the
rich
is
long
and
long
the
longest
of
hangmen
cords
but
the
kings
and
crowds
are
holding
their
bream
in
a
giant
shadow
all
beneath
where
god
stands
holding
the
scales
of
death
between
the
cattle
and
swords
haply
the
lords
that
hire
and
lend
the
lowest
of
all
men
lords
who
sell
their
kind
like
kine
at
a
fair
will
find
no
head
of
their
cattle
there
but
faces
of
men
where
cattle
were
faces
of
men
and
swords
and
the
name
shining
and
terrible
the
sternest
of
all
man
words
still
mark
that
place
to
seek
or
shun
in
the
streets
where
the
struggling
cattle
run
grass
and
a
silence
of
judgment
done
in
the
place
that
is
called
swords
a
song
of
defeat
the
line
breaks
and
the
guns
go
under
the
lords
and
the
lackeys
ride
the
plain
i
draw
deep
breaths
of
the
dawn
and
thunder
and
the
whole
of
my
heart
grows
young
again
for
our
chiefs
said
done
and
i
did
not
deem
it
our
seers
said
peace
and
it
was
not
peace
earth
will
grow
worse
till
men
redeem
it
and
wars
more
evil
ere
all
wars
cease
but
the
old
flags
reel
and
the
old
drums
rattle
as
once
in
my
life
they
throbbed
and
reeled
i
have
found
ray
youth
in
the
lost
battle
i
have
found
my
heart
on
the
battlefield
for
we
that
fight
till
the
world
is
free
we
are
not
easy
in
victory
we
have
known
each
other
too
long
my
brother
and
fought
each
other
the
world
and
we
and
i
dream
of
the
days
when
work
was
scrappy
and
rare
in
our
pockets
the
mark
of
the
mint
when
we
were
angry
and
poor
and
happy
and
proud
of
seeing
our
names
in
print
for
so
they
conquered
and
so
we
scattered
when
the
devil
rode
and
his
dogs
smelt
gold
and
the
peace
of
a
harmless
folk
was
shattered
when
i
was
twenty
and
odd
years
old
when
the
mongrel
men
that
the
market
classes
had
slimy
hands
upon
england
rod
and
sword
in
hand
upon
afric
passes
her
last
republic
cried
to
god
for
the
men
no
lords
can
buy
or
sell
they
sit
not
easy
when
all
goes
well
they
have
said
to
each
other
what
naught
can
smother
they
have
seen
each
other
our
souls
and
hell
it
is
all
as
of
old
the
empty
clangour
the
nothing
scrawled
on
a
page
the
huckster
who
mocking
holy
anger
painfully
paints
his
face
with
rage
and
the
faith
of
the
poor
is
faint
and
partial
and
the
pride
of
the
rich
is
all
for
sale
and
the
chosen
heralds
of
england
marshal
are
the
of
the
daily
mail
and
the
niggards
that
dare
not
give
are
glutted
and
the
feeble
that
dare
not
fail
are
strong
so
while
the
city
of
toil
is
gutted
i
sit
in
the
saddle
and
sing
my
song
for
we
that
fight
till
the
world
is
free
we
have
no
comfort
in
victory
we
have
read
each
other
as
cain
his
brother
we
know
each
other
these
slaves
and
we
sonnet
on
hearing
a
landlord
accused
falsely
for
all
the
bard
can
say
of
neglecting
one
of
the
numerous
white
horses
that
were
or
were
not
connected
with
alfred
the
great
if
you
have
picked
your
lawn
of
leaves
and
snails
if
you
have
told
your
valet
even
with
oaths
once
a
week
or
so
to
brush
your
clothes
if
you
have
dared
to
clean
your
teeth
or
nails
while
the
horse
upon
the
holy
mountain
fails
then
god
that
alfred
to
his
earth
betrothes
send
on
you
screaming
all
that
honour
loathes
horsewhipping
hounsditch
debts
and
can
you
not
even
conserve
for
if
indeed
the
white
horse
fades
then
closer
creeps
the
fight
when
we
shall
scour
the
face
of
england
white
plucking
such
men
as
you
up
like
a
weed
and
fling
them
far
beyond
a
shaft
shot
right
when
wessex
went
to
battle
for
the
creed
africa
a
sleepy
people
without
priests
or
kings
dreamed
here
men
say
to
drive
us
to
the
sea
o
let
us
drive
ourselves
for
it
is
free
and
smells
of
honour
and
of
english
things
how
came
we
brawling
by
these
bitter
springs
we
of
the
north
two
kindly
nations
we
though
the
dice
rattles
and
the
clear
coin
rings
here
is
no
place
for
living
men
to
be
leave
them
the
gold
that
worked
and
whined
for
it
let
them
that
have
no
nation
anywhere
be
native
here
and
fat
and
full
of
bread
but
we
whose
sins
were
human
we
will
quit
the
land
of
blood
and
leave
these
vultures
there
noiselessly
happy
feeding
on
the
dead
the
dead
hero
we
never
saw
you
like
our
sires
for
whom
your
face
was
freedom
face
nor
know
what
and
wires
with
such
strong
cords
may
interlace
we
know
not
if
the
statesmen
then
were
fashioned
as
the
sort
we
see
we
know
that
not
under
your
ken
did
england
laugh
at
liberty
yea
this
one
thing
is
known
of
you
we
know
that
not
till
you
were
dumb
not
till
your
course
was
thundered
through
did
mammon
see
his
kingdom
come
the
songs
of
theft
the
swords
of
hire
the
clerks
that
raved
the
troops
that
ran
the
empire
of
the
world
desire
the
dance
of
all
the
dirt
began
the
happy
jewelled
alien
men
worked
then
but
as
a
little
leaven
from
some
more
modest
palace
then
the
soul
of
dives
stank
to
heaven
but
when
they
planned
with
lisp
and
leer
their
careful
war
upon
the
weak
they
smote
your
body
on
its
bier
for
surety
that
you
could
not
speak
a
hero
in
the
desert
died
men
cried
that
saints
should
bury
him
and
round
the
grave
should
guard
and
ride
a
chivalry
of
cherubim
god
said
there
is
a
better
place
a
nobler
trophy
and
more
tall
the
beasts
that
fled
before
his
face
shall
come
to
make
his
funeral
the
mighty
vermin
of
the
void
that
hid
them
from
his
bended
bow
shall
crawl
from
caverns
overjoyed
jackal
and
snake
and
carrion
crow
and
perched
above
the
vulture
eggs
reversed
upon
its
hideous
head
a
ape
shall
wave
its
legs
to
tell
the
world
that
he
is
dead
an
election
echo
this
is
their
trumpet
ripe
and
rounded
they
have
burnt
the
wheat
and
gathered
the
chaff
and
we
that
have
fought
them
we
that
have
watched
them
have
we
at
least
not
cause
to
laugh
never
so
low
at
least
we
stumbled
dead
we
have
been
but
not
so
dead
as
these
that
live
on
the
life
they
squandered
as
these
that
drink
of
the
blood
they
shed
we
never
boasted
the
thing
we
blundered
we
never
haunted
the
thing
that
fails
we
never
quailed
from
the
living
laughter
to
howl
to
the
dead
who
tell
no
tales
was
another
finger
at
least
that
pointed
our
wasted
men
or
our
emptied
bags
it
was
not
we
that
sounded
the
trumpet
in
front
of
the
triumph
of
wrecks
and
rags
fear
not
these
they
have
made
their
bargain
they
have
counted
the
cost
of
the
last
of
raids
they
have
staked
their
lives
on
the
things
that
live
not
they
have
burnt
their
house
for
a
fire
that
fades
five
years
ago
and
we
might
have
feared
them
been
drubbed
by
the
coward
and
taught
by
the
dunce
truth
may
endure
and
be
told
and
but
a
lie
can
never
be
young
but
once
five
years
ago
and
we
might
have
feared
them
now
when
they
lift
the
laurelled
brow
there
shall
naught
go
up
from
our
hosts
assembled
but
a
laugh
like
thunder
we
know
them
now
the
song
of
the
wheels
written
during
a
friday
and
saturday
in
august
king
dives
he
was
waiting
in
his
garden
all
alone
where
his
flowers
are
made
of
iron
and
his
trees
are
made
of
stone
and
his
hives
are
full
of
thunder
and
the
lightning
leaps
and
kills
for
the
mills
of
god
grind
slowly
and
he
works
with
other
mills
dives
found
a
mighty
silence
and
he
missed
the
throb
and
leap
the
noise
of
all
the
sleepless
creatures
singing
him
to
sleep
and
he
said
a
screw
has
fallen
or
a
bolt
has
slipped
aside
some
little
thing
has
shifted
and
the
little
things
replied

king
dives
he
was
walking
in
his
garden
in
the
sun
he
shook
his
hand
at
heaven
and
he
called
the
wheels
to
run
and
the
eyes
of
him
were
hateful
eyes
the
lips
of
him
were
curled
and
he
called
upon
his
father
that
is
lord
below
the
world
sitting
in
the
gate
of
treason
in
the
gate
of
broken
seals
bend

bend

bend
and
bind
them
into

then
once
more

there
may

the

the
sleepless

sing

the

people

pay
us
pass
us
but
do
not
quite
forget
for
we
are
the
people
of
england
that
never
has
spoken
yet
there
is
many
a
fat
farmer
that
drinks
less
cheerfully
there
is
many
a
free
french
peasant
who
is
richer
and
sadder
than
we
there
are
no
folk
in
the
whole
world
so
helpless
or
so
wise
there
is
hunger
in
our
bellies
there
is
laughter
in
our
eyes
you
laugh
at
us
and
love
us
both
mugs
and
eyes
are
wet
only
you
do
not
know
us
for
we
have
not
spoken
yet
the
fine
french
kings
came
over
in
a
flutter
of
flags
and
dames
we
liked
their
smiles
and
battles
but
we
never
could
say
their
names
the
blood
ran
red
to
bosworth
and
the
high
french
lords
went
down
there
was
naught
but
a
naked
people
under
a
naked
crown
and
the
eyes
of
the
king
servants
turned
terribly
every
way
and
the
gold
of
the
king
servants
rose
higher
every
day
they
burnt
the
homes
of
the
shaven
men
that
had
been
quaint
and
kind
till
there
was
no
bed
in
a
monk
house
nor
food
that
man
could
find
the
inns
of
god
where
no
man
paid
that
were
the
wall
of
the
weak
the
king
servants
ate
them
all
and
still
we
did
not
speak
and
the
face
of
the
king
servants
grew
greater
than
the
king
he
tricked
them
and
they
trapped
him
and
stood
round
him
in
a
ring
the
new
grave
lords
closed
round
him
that
had
eaten
the
abbey
fruits
and
the
men
of
the
new
religion
with
their
bibles
in
their
boots
we
saw
their
shoulders
moving
to
menace
or
discuss
and
some
were
pure
and
some
were
vile
but
none
took
heed
of
us
we
saw
the
king
as
they
killed
him
and
his
face
was
proud
and
pale
and
a
few
men
talked
of
freedom
while
england
talked
of
ale
a
war
that
we
understood
not
came
over
the
world
and
woke
americans
frenchmen
irish
but
we
knew
not
the
things
they
spoke
they
talked
about
rights
and
nature
and
peace
and
the
people
reign
and
the
squires
our
masters
bade
us
fight
and
never
scorned
us
again
weak
if
we
be
for
ever
could
none
condemn
us
then
men
called
us
serfs
and
drudges
men
knew
that
we
were
men
in
foam
and
flame
at
trafalgar
on
albuera
plains
we
did
and
died
like
lions
to
keep
ourselves
in
chains
we
lay
in
living
ruins
firing
and
fearing
not
the
strange
fierce
face
of
the
frenchmen
who
knew
for
what
they
fought
and
the
man
who
seemed
to
be
more
than
man
we
strained
against
and
broke
and
we
broke
our
own
rights
with
him
and
still
we
never
spoke
our
patch
of
glory
ended
we
never
heard
guns
again
but
the
squire
seemed
struck
in
the
saddle
he
was
foolish
as
if
in
pain
he
leaned
on
a
staggering
lawyer
he
clutched
a
cringing
jew
he
was
stricken
it
may
be
after
all
he
was
stricken
at
waterloo
or
perhaps
the
shades
of
the
shaven
men
whose
spoil
is
in
his
house
come
back
in
shining
shapes
at
last
to
spoil
his
last
carouse
we
only
know
the
last
sad
squires
ride
slowly
towards
the
sea
and
a
new
people
takes
the
land
and
still
it
is
not
we
they
have
given
us
into
the
hand
of
the
new
unhappy
lords
lords
without
anger
and
honour
who
dare
not
carry
their
swords
they
fight
by
shuffling
papers
they
have
bright
dead
alien
eyes
they
look
at
our
labour
and
laughter
as
a
tired
man
looks
at
flies
and
the
load
their
loveless
pity
is
worse
than
the
ancient
wrongs
their
doors
are
shut
in
the
evening
and
they
know
no
songs
we
hear
men
speaking
for
us
of
new
laws
strong
and
sweet
yet
is
there
no
man
speaketh
as
we
speak
in

it
may

the

the

saw

peril
is

and
knew
he
was

went
from

he
turned
him
back
and
cried
for

little

from

there
came
no
flower
from

the
woods
were
dark
in

and
not

for

contempt

reward

flameless

flung

flaming
sword
it
burns
the
hand
that
holds

more
than
the

it
scores
it
doubles

snake
and
stings
yet
he
in
whose
hand
it
swings
he
is
the
most
masterful
of
things
a
scorner
of
the
stars
when
i
came
back
to
fleet
street
when
i
came
back
to
fleet
street
through
a
sunset
nook
at
night
and
saw
the
old
green
dragon
with
the
windows
all
alight
and
hailed
the
old
green
dragon
and
the
cock
i
used
to
know
where
all
good
fellows
were
my
friends
a
little
while
ago
i
had
been
long
in
meadows
and
the
trees
took
hold
of
me
and
the
still
towns
in
the
where
men
were
meant
to
be
but
old
things
held
the
laughter
the
long
unnatural
night
and
all
the
truth
they
talk
in
hell
and
all
the
lies
they
write
for
i
came
back
to
fleet
street
and
not
in
peace
i
came
a
cloven
pride
was
in
my
heart
and
half
my
love
was
shame
i
came
to
fight
in
whose
end
shall
no
man
know
to
fight
the
old
green
dragon
until
the
cock
shall
crow
under
the
broad
bright
windows
of
men
i
serve
no
more
the
groaning
of
the
old
great
wheels
thickened
to
a
throttled
roar
all
buried
things
broke
upward
and
peered
from
its
retreat
ugly
and
silent
like
an
elf
the
secret
of
the
street
they
did
not
break
the
padlocks
or
clear
the
wall
away
the
men
in
debt
that
drank
of
old
still
drink
in
debt
chained
to
the
rich
by
ruin
cheerful
in
chains
as
then
when
old
unbroken
pickwick
walked
among
the
broken
men
still
he
that
dreams
and
rambles
through
his
own
elfin
air
knows
that
the
street
a
prison
knows
that
the
gates
are
there
still
he
that
scorns
or
struggles
sees
frightful
and
afar
all
that
they
leave
of
rebels
rot
high
on
temple
bar
all
that
i
loved
and
hated
all
that
i
shunned
and
knew

in
broad
battle
lightning
where
they
and
i
and
you
run
high
the
barricade
that
breaks
the
barriers
of
the
street
and
shout
to
them
that
shrink
within
the
prisoners
of
the
fleet
a
cider
song
extract
from
a
romance
which
is
not
yet
written
and
probably
never
will
be
the
wine
they
drink
in
paradise
they
make
in
haute
lorraine
god
brought
it
burning
from
the
sod
to
be
a
sign
and
signal
rod
that
they
that
drink
the
blood
of
god
shall
never
thirst
again
the
wine
they
praise
in
paradise
they
make
in
ponterey
the
purple
wine
of
paradise
but
we
have
better
at
the
price
it
wine
they
praise
in
paradise
it
cider
that
they
pray
the
wine
they
want
in
paradise
they
find
in
plodder
end
the
apple
wine
of
hereford
of

went
down
to

soft
western
vales

the

all

the

blew
out
from

from
the
dawning
to
the
day
there
was
a
wreck
of
trees
and
fall
of
towers
a
score
of
miles
away

drifted
like

livid
leaf
i
go
before
its

spewed
out
of

beggared
of

and

the

bowed
about

shouting
like
seraph

with
rains
that
might
put
out

clean
the

stole
my
lady
bride
from
them
they
stole
her
back
from
me
i
rent
her
from
her
hall
i
rode
and
saw
arise
more
lovely
than
the
living
flowers
the
hatred
in
her
eyes
she
never
loved
me
never
bent
never
was
less
divine
the
sunset
never
loved
me
the
wind
was
never
mine
was
it
all
nothing
that
she
stood
imperial
in

silence
itself
made
softer
with
the
sweeping
of
her
dress

you
who
drain
the
cup

never

from

dawning

bar
my

not
be
forgiven
you
though
your
sins
cried
to
vaughan
these
desperate
you
could
not
spare
who
steal
with
nothing
left
to
pawn
you
caged
a
man
up
like
a
bear
for
ever
in
a
jailor
care
because
his
sins
were
more
than
i
know
a
house
in
hoxton
where
it
shall
not
be
forgiven
you
envoi
princess
you
trapped
a
guileless
mayor
to
meet
some
people
that
you
knew
when
the
last
trumpet
rends
the
air
it
shall
not
be
forgiven
you
a
ballade
of
an
they
spoke
of
progress
spiring
round
of
light
and
humphry
ward
it
is
not
true
to
say
i
frowned
or
ran
about
the
room
and
roared
i
might
have
simply
sat
and
snored
i
rose
politely
in
the
club
and
said
i
feel
a
little
bored
will
someone
take
me
to
a
pub
the
new
world
wisest
did
surround
me
and
it
pains
me
to
record
i
did
not
think
their
views
profound
or
their
conclusions
well
assured
the
simple
life
i
ca
afford
besides
i
do
not
like
the
grub
i
wait
a
mash
and
sausage
scored
will
someone
take
me
to
a
pub
i
know
where
men
can
still
be
found
anger
and
clamorous
accord
and
virtues
growing
from
the
ground
and
fellowship
of
beer
and
board
and
song
that
is
a
sturdy
cord
and
hope
that
is
a
hardy
shrub
and
goodness
that
is
god
last
word
will
someone
take
me
to
a
pub
envoi
prince
bayard
would
have
smashed
his
sword
to
see
the
sort
of
knights
you
dub
is
that
the
last
of
them
o
lord
will
someone
take
me
to
a
pub
a
ballade
of
a
i
have
not
read
a
rotten
page
of
or
the
social
test
and
here
comes
husks
and
heritage
o
moses
give
us
all
a
rest
ethics
of
empire
i
protest
i
will
not
even
cut
the
strings
i
read
jack
redskin
on
the
quest
and
feed
my
brain
with
better
things
somebody
wants
a
wiser
age
he
also
wants
me
to
invest
somebody
likes
the
finnish
stage
because
the
jesters
do
not
jest
and
grey
with
dust
is
dante
crest
the
bell
of
rabelais
soundless
swings
and
the
winds
come
out
of
the
west
and
feed
my
brain
with
better
things
lord
of
our
laughter
and
our
rage
look
on
us
with
our
sins
oppressed
i
too
have
trodden
mine
heritage
wickedly
wearying
of
the
best
burn
from
my
brain
and
from
my
breast
sloth
and
the
cowardice
that
clings
and
stiffness
and
the
soul
arrest
and
feed
my
brain
with
better
things
envoi
prince
you
are
host
and
i
am
guest
therefore
i
shrink
from
cavillings
but
i
should
have
that
fizz
suppressed
and
feed
my
brain
with
better
things
a
ballade
of
suicide
the
gallows
in
my
garden
people
say
is
new
and
neat
and
adequately
tall
i
tie
the
noose
on
in
a
knowing
way
as
one
that
knots
his
necktie
for
a
ball
but
just
as
all
the
neighbours
on
the
wall
are
drawing
a
long
breath
to
shout
hurray
the
strangest
whim
has
seized
me
after
all
i
think
i
will
not
hang
myself
is
the
time
i
get
my
pay
my
uncle
sword
is
hanging
in
the
hall
i
see
a
little
cloud
all
pink
and
grey
perhaps
the
rector
mother
will
call
i
fancy
that
i
heard
from
gall
that
mushrooms
could
be
cooked
another
way
i
never
read
the
works
of
juvenal
i
think
i
will
not
hang
myself
the
world
will
have
another
washing
day
the
decadents
decay
the
pedants
pall
and
wells
has
found
that
children
play
and
bernard
shaw
discovered
that
they
squall
rationalists
are
growing
rational
and
through
thick
woods
one
finds
a
stream
astray
so
secret
that
the
very
sky
seems
small
i
think
i
will
not
hang
myself
envoi
prince
i
can
hear
the
trumpet
of
germinal
the
tumbrils
toiling
up
the
terrible
way
even
your
royal
head
may
fall
i
think
i
will
not
hang
myself
a
ballade
of
the
first
rain
the
sky
is
blue
with
summer
and
the
sun
the
woods
are
brown
as
autumn
with
the
tan
it
might
as
well
be
tropics
and
be
done
i
might
as
well
be
born
a
copper
khan
i
fashion
me
an
oriental
fan
made
of
the
wholly
unreceipted
bills
brought
by
the
sleeping
in
his
van
a
storm
is
coming
on
the
chiltern
hills
i
read
the
young
philosophers
for
fun
fresh
as
our
sorrow
for
the
late
queen
anne
the
dionysians
whom
a
pint
would
stun
the
pantheists
who
never
heard
of
pan
but
through
my
hair
electric
needles
ran
and
on
my
book
a
gout
of
water
spills
and
on
the
skirts
of
heaven
the
guns
began
a
storm
is
coming
on
the
chiltern
hills
o
fields
of
england
cracked
and
dry
and
dun
o
soul
of
england
sick
of
words
and
wan
the
clouds
grow
dark
the
has
begun
it
comes
it
comes
as
holy
darkness
can
black
as
with
banners
ban
and
a
falling
laughter
all
the
valley
fills
deep
as
god
thunder
and
the
thirst
of
man
a
storm
is
coming
on
the
chiltern
hills
envoi
prince
on
the
modern
plan
fulfilling
such
a
lot
of
people
wills
you
take
the
chiltern
hundreds
while
you
can
a
storm
is
coming
on
the
chiltern
hills
