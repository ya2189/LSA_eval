foreword
i
only
a
common
with
a
eye
to
my
vittles
an
beer
but
afore
i
puts
my
money
on
joe
there
a
thing
or
two
as
i
like
to
know
which
quite
clear
i
admit
as
it
sounds
for
to
shut
them
furriners
out
but
every
board
school
nipper
knows
as
there
things
wot
only
a
furriner
grows
as
we
could
well
do
without
there
sugar
an
rice
an
there
cawfy
an
tea
as
well
as
we
never
could
raise
suppose
we
tried
and
we
to
buy
somewheres
outside
and
the
furriners
to
sell
but
they
do
give
nothin
for
nothink
which
you
ca
dispute
the
fac
an
we
sending
hevery
bit
as
much
of
our
an
our
coal
an
such
as
pay
the
beggars
back
an
the
less
we
buys
o
them
furrin
goods
the
less
of
our
own
returned
which
it
plain
to
see
as
the
more
they
take
the
more
our
firms
a
chance
to
make
an
the
the
wages
earned
for
it
british
labour
as
pays
the
price
o
them
goods
as
crosses
the
sea
an
suppose
as
the
furrin
imports
fail
it
the
case
of
a
empty
for
the
like
me
let
the
furriner
send
foodstuffs
in
lor
bless
you
i
ai
afraid
for
the
more
we
markets
with
other
lands
the
more
employment
for
british
an
the
better
for
british
trade
i
no
love
for
the
german
man
nor
yet
for
the
turk
but
i
ai
a
fool
as
shut
the
door
in
the
face
of
even
a
blooming
boer
if
the
beggar
can
give
me
work
for
it
work
i
wants
an
it
wages
too
an
i
lookin
afore
i
leap
i
wo
go
chucking
a
job
away
on
the
chance
of
a
possible
rise
o
pay
while
food
to
be
so
cheap
i
only
a
workin
artisan
but
the
truth
i
like
to
know
i
ai
for
takin
no
risks
myself
of
a
empty
grate
an
a
empty
shelf
no
thanks
sir
not
for
joe
says
as
the
country
and
do
it
too
maybe
if
the
do
a
care
they
find
as
there
ai
no
country
there
when
swep
it
into
the
sea
protection
i
got
the
dumpophobia
bad
as
is
easy
for
to
see
when
a
little
lad
i
was
bit
by
a
mad
manufacturin
man
maybe
an
i
simply
goes
clean
off
my
chump
if
anyone
to
mention
for
it
wi
they
furriner
folks
sez
i
will
we
take
it
down
when
they
dumps
cheap
goods
as
we
wants
to
buy
into
every
british
town
tho
it
a
thing
as
they
would
do
if
we
orders
to
but
there
good
times
coming
an
thanks
to
joe
when
the
hempire
stand
on
own
we
be
quit
o
the
food
them
furriners
grow
an
rely
on
ourselves
alone
for
us
an
the
colonies
too
i
lay
can
grow
it
as
good
an
they
we
a
british
race
an
we
soon
depend
on
the
produc
o
british
soil
no
more
of
our
wage
we
spend
upon
cheap
american
oil
them
dazzlin
lamps
is
a
big
mistake
while
there
tallow
candles
o
british
make
we
the
finest
coal
in
the
wide
earth
which
we
used
for
to
sell
abroad
but
now
as
we
knows
much
it
worth
we
save
it
an
it
an
tho
the
pitmen
a
word
to
say
when
the
mines
shuts
down
an
they
turned
away
no
more
o
the
roosian
corn
we
touch
nor
the
south
american
wheat
an
we
gladly
pay
if
it
twice
as
much
to
loaves
to
eat
for
the
english
these
days
must
learn
for
to
live
on
colonial
maize
if
there
less
to
eat
it
taste
more
sweet
when
the
britishers
all
combine
we
tinned
an
frozen
noo
zealand
meat
washed
down
with
australian
wine
which
it
ai
so
terrible
bad
to
drink
if
you
fancies
honions
mixed
with
ink
no
more
o
your
roosian
sable
cloaks
for
the
gentry
nor
paris
they
buying
their
bunnets
at
sevenoaks
an
the
trimmin
is
cats
an
that
furrin
jewelry
just
a
sham
they
can
sell
you
as
good
in
them
italian
organs
to
go
an
the
barrers
as
well
when
we
buying
a
glass
o
snow
from
some
smart
canadian
swell
an
no
more
o
your
music
from
germanee
when
our
motto
is
acrost
the
sea
when
the
furriner
foodstuffs
out
we
shuts
we
still
the
run
of
our
teeth
on
the
cocoa
we
makes
off
o
cocoanuts
as
they
grows
upon
an
o
british
pluck
we
can
surely
brag
when
we
smoking
the
irish
shag
we
our
food
too
cheap
sez
joe
if
you
listens
to
advice
the
cost
o
the
loaf
too
small
an
so
to
raise
the
price
this
pertection
a
splendid
plan
but
it
werry
lines
on
the
retaliation
i
a
quarrel
with
slade
keeps
our
only
village
inn
said
as
shoes
was
badly
made
an
i
said
as
was
thin
more
o
boots
i
buy
sez
no
more
o
beer
sez
i
me
nex
time
as
shoes
was
out
o
repair
took
to
lunnon
did
an
wot
wi
the
bill
an
the
railway
fare
why
it
cost
werry
near
a
quid
if
stayed
at
an
give
the
job
would
paid
but
a
couple
o
bob
now
tinkering
boots
is
a
thirsty
trade
which
them
as
tried
it
wo
deny
but
i
would
get
beer
orf
o
slade
an
there
was
no
other
as
i
could
buy
an
so
for
a
month
very
near
i
think
i
was
starving
for
the
lack
of
a
drink
but
at
last
to
a
comperimize
we
come
an
said
as
my
boots
was
right
enough
an
i
told
arter
i
tasted
some
as
beer
was
really
bad
stuff
so
we
both
shakes
on
the
village
green
an
we
seed
what
a
couple
o
fools
we
been
but
there
was
no
good
come
out
o
the
fight
an
we
both
worse
off
than
we
was
before
tho
i
sits
in
private
bar
of
a
night
an
gives
me
shoes
to
mend
once
more
for
slade
lost
temper
an
eight
bob
clear
an
i
catch
up
wi
that
three
weeks
beer
now
if
england
quarrels
with
roosia
say
or
them
aggrannoying
united
states
she
can
tax
their
imports
an
make
pay
more
dooties
an
rates
but
suppose
as
we
taxes
the
goods
they
sell
it
likely
as
they
tax
ours
as
well
an
o
manufactured
goods
an
such
we
sendin
three
times
as
much
as
they
so
i
ca
see
as
we
be
gaining
much
with
a
three
times
tax
to
pay
it
a
game
as
two
can
play
you
see
an
they
be
less
than
we
for
the
balance
o
goods
as
they
sells
to
us
is
the
corn
an
the
grain
an
the
foods
we
eat
an
it
likely
the
working
class
cuss
if
we
levies
a
tax
on
the
furrin
wheat
which
merely
fall
on
the
poor
man
by
the
price
of
loaf
o
bread
this
retaliation
a
game
if
we
taxes
the
furriner
barley
we
shall
only
be
ourselves
to
blame
when
we
to
pay
more
for
our
free
food
is
the
best
for
british
trade
an
for
you
an
for
me
an
for
slade
the
colonies
i
been
round
the
pubs
as
the
british
lion
cubs
is
a
gettin
out
of
and
for
the
colonies
they
say
is
a
driftin
right
away
from
the
motherland
wot
seed
safely
started
but
it
only
little
englanders
protectionists
an
such
keeps
an
as
the
empire
o
touch
there
was
canada
i
know
kipling
said
as
she
snow
which
o
course
was
met
with
angry
contradictions
then
haustralia
come
next
an
one
found
a
text
to
remind
of
their
ancestors
convictions
it
unfortunit
but
still
we
must
admit
it
for
a
fact
as
we
englishmen
is
notorious
for
tact
but
wotever
folks
may
shout
an
make
grievances
about
there
uncommon
little
grounds
as
they
can
go
on
for
the
strength
o
hempire
lies
more
in
sentimental
ties
than
in
any
interests
an
so
on
an
there
feelings
of
affection
an
o
kindness
as
is
worth
twice
as
much
as
all
them
there
interests
on
earth
an
our
colonies
stand
by
the
good
ole
motherland
tho
she
may
at
times
be
rather
trying
for
they
knows
as
well
as
we
that
there
nowheres
so
free
as
them
countries
where
the
british
flag
an
with
kindly
eyes
they
looks
acrost
wot
poets
calls
the
foam
to
that
distant
little
island
as
they
still
considers
ome
an
they
stick
if
they
are
wise
to
them
sentimental
ties
never
mind
if
they
ca
value
in
dollars
for
they
independent
blokes
an
they
would
stand
no
yokes
nor
they
does
with
wearin
chains
an
collars
even
dawgs
an
such
love
you
more
i
not
the
slightest
doubt
if
you
turns
loose
an
keeps
free
an
lets
run
about
if
them
colonies
drift
for
theirselves
they
to
shift
it
a
case
o
alone
or
tho
their
lads
is
sterling
stuff
still
they
big
enough
for
to
their
own
agin
some
furrin
nation
an
their
armies
o
is
hexcellent
but
small
while
o
navies
to
defend
their
coasts
they
none
at
all
yes
they
knows
as
well
as
we
as
it
hengland
rules
the
sea
tho
it
ai
for
me
to
go
and
say
it
an
it
henglishmen
as
pays
for
the
navy
nowadays
it
ai
canadians
as
pay
it
so
they
gives
to
us
the
of
defendin
of
if
we
lets
run
their
own
concerns
an
does
interfere
we
a
market
as
they
knows
for
the
produce
wot
they
grows
which
commercially
a
quite
sufficient
fetter
an
so
long
as
they
can
trade
at
the
present
prices
paid
why
they
do
want
nothink
easier
nor
better
an
a
preference
wo
make
no
more
loyal
than
before
for
they
proved
their
bloomin
loyalty
a
times
and
more
if
we
likes
to
pay
for
their
foodstuffs
as
we
buy
well
it
natural
as
they
must
applaud
it
but
they
wants
no
preference
at
the
motherland
expense
if
she
ai
in
no
position
to
afford
it
an
they
knows
as
well
as
we
do
that
any
bounties
paid
must
be
on
british
an
bad
for
british
trade
for
they
showed
us
in
the
war
they
was
loyal
to
the
core
an
they
ready
for
to
us
when
we
flounders
an
tho
and
there
there
some
discontented
chaps
as
grumble
like
them
there
alaskan
bounders
still
they
british
to
the
backbone
when
the
dawgs
o
war
is
loosed
an
they
stick
by
mother
england
till
the
cows
comes
to
roost

were
when
times

thought

be
if
we
all
agree
on
a
kind
of
a
mutual
trade
sez
for
our
things
as
we
sold
an
bought
we
one
another
which
sounded
nice

getting
our
goods
at
a
lower
price
i
tinker
the
boots
o
the
family
cheap
an
get
on
my
uncle

no
fear
an
for
luxuries
such
as
the
missus
eats
i
could
get
orf
o
katie

but
it
did
work
for
my
uncle
fred

me
crool
unfair
i
sold
some
shoes
starvation
price
but
i
beer
but
twice
when
said
as
i
drunk
my
share
then
i
mended
a
couple
o
pairs
o
kate
but

a
thing
as

an
i
quite
enough
o
that
rubbish
o
kate
wot
was
always
the
kind
of
a
woman
i
yes
family
ties
is
a
splendid
thing
if
it
keeps
there
when
it
comes
to
a
question
o
gold
and
gain
they
turns
at
once
to
a
hirksome
chain
such
as
nobody
wants
to
wear
when
matters
of
money
appears
on
the
floor
them
family
feelings
walks
out
at
the
door
if
england
to
an
fight
for
colonial
preference
if
the
love
of
sons
for
the
motherland
is
a
kind
of
a
feeling
as
only
can
stand
on
a
basis
o
shillings
an
pence
that
sort
o
foundation
wo
last
overlong
an
there
something
i
lay
must
be
wrong
when
the
colonies
out
their
to
us
it
was
for
british
gold
but
who
vouch
for
the
love
o
the
when
bargains
honour
for
tariffs
on
corn
an
loyalty
bartered
an
sold
a
we
make
who
shall
most
o
the
cake
we
shall
them
australian
governments
for
better
terms
an
there
sure
to
be
plenty
o
grumbling
when
the
canadian
manufacturing
men
is
competing
wi
henglish
firms
an
each
separate
part
o
the
hempire
feel
as
the
others
is
the
best
o
the
deal
from
which
if
you
follows
my
meaning
through
there
a
obvious
moral
to
draw
let
consider
the
motherland
future
afore
we
allows
to
risk
being
mother
no
more
an
becoming
the
for
if
loyalty
paid
for
it
ai
worth
a
thought
an
affection
a
fraud
if
it
to
be
bought
british
trade
oh
why
was
i
born
a
english
lad
in
a
island
all
shut
in
by
sea
wot
a
much
better
chance
i
might
if
i
only
been
in
germanee
oh
why
was
i
thus
unwilling
on
the
blooming
o
the
world
no
doubt
as
the
german
artisan
do
get
very
much
in
the
matter
o
pay
but
works
on
the
plan
with
a
haverage
thirteen
hours
a
day
an
no
time
for
to
sit
an
think
nor
money
enough
to
take
to
drink
then
give
me
a
permanent
german
job
with
nothink
at
all
but
work
to
do
with
weekly
wages
o
sixteen
bob
for
to
keep
myself
an
the
missus
too
them
gimcrack
german
toys
for
poor
little
english
gals
an
boys
to
my
london
i
say
for
i
no
use
for
a
open
port
where
the
workin
wage
is
a
deal
too
an
the
workin
hours
is
far
too
short
where
a
time
to
sleep
an
food
to
be
so
rotten
cheap
a
german
factory
more
my
taste
with
none
o
them
lazy
english
ways
where
there
ai
no
money
or
time
to
waste
on
an
an
the
workin
classes
can
just
contrive
to
earn
sufficient
to
keep
alive
when
i
slaves
all
day
at
a
german
trade
them
goods
as
they
dumps
down
when
i
overworked
an
i
underpaid
till
i
feels

i
gets
back
of

to
eat

such
a
appetite
i
never

the
finest

when
you
swollerin

begs
to
state
when

with
a
kind
of
a
look
in
my
eye
if
i
to
wait
with
a

wi
scorn
o
the
old

so
cheap
for
we
do
know
nothink
o
but
joe
learn
us
to
eat
it
when
tariff
makes
british
meat
too
dear
for
the
pockets
o
british
workin
men
an
they
their
little
marys
lined
with
a
diet
o
maize
an
bacon
rind
when
the
price
goes
up
of
our
meat
and
bread
by
a
grand
imperial
scheme
o
joe
we
get
cheap
sugar
and
tea
instead
an
we
buy
no
food
orf
o
britain
foes
for
we
no
need
o
the
furriner
crops
when
we
living
on
sweets
washed
down
wi
slops
there
lessons
to
learn
from
german
trade
in
spite
o
this
foolish
fiscal
fuss
tho
their
peoples
ai
no
better
paid
nor
near
as
well
orf
for
food
as
us
for
wotever
the
german
workman
lot
knows
to
use
wot
brains
got
an
if
employers
only
learn
a
few
o
they
furrin
commercial
ways
to
make
the
business
their
first
concern
an
not
be
so
set
upon

would
be
always
orf
for
the
sake
of
a
afternoon
at
gorf
with
the
wants
o
the
trade
they
keep
in
touch
an
sometimes
stay
at
the
orfice
late
if
their
business
methods
ai
up
to
much
they
at
any
rate
could
be
for
there
is
no
need
of
a
fiscal
fence
if
you
henergy
coupled
wi
we
english
ai
our
best
an
that
the
reason
we
loses
ground
it
time
as
we
took
more
interest
an
the
chance
come
to
all
round
no
need
for
to
put
it
in
doggerel
rhymes
to
see
as
we
right
the
times
for
it
heducation
we
wants
that
all
to
make
us
the
country
we
ought
to
be
if
we
rides
for
a
fall
at
a
tariff
wall
we
very
soon
find
ourselves
at
sea
which
the
simile
somewot
mixed
you
say
but
the
meanin
clear
as
the
open
day
then
a
to
the
motherland
for
all
as
they
says
she
goin
to
pot
ole
england
walls
stand
when
the
fiscal
fences
is
all
forgot
an
she
own
by
land
or
sea
so
long
as
sons
an
trade
is
free
controversial
entertainment
on
saturdays
i
often
goes
an
spends
a
evenin
in
the
pit
at
one
of
them
shows
an
makes
a
night
of
it
but
since
this
fiscal
row
begun
i
to
look
elsewheres
for
fun
i
partial
to
a
but
when
last
week
i
chanced
to
go
i
some
blighter
bawl
a
jingo
song
in
praise
o
joe
more
will
england
sez
this
crank
with
the
german
an
the
yank
at
furrin
countries
the
sea
a
lot
o
silly
jeers
thinks
i
where
would
ole
england
be
without
the
market
o
the
world
we
make
a
living
i
suppose
a
washin
of
each
other
clo
nex
come
the
cinematograph
an
joe
i
need
say
was
there
a
picture
of
upper
smilin
in
a
chair
there
no
photographer
in
town
would
dare
to
lying
down
then
a
come
along
a
saucy
bunnet
on
she
did
sing
no
fiscal
song
she
spoke
a
fiscal
pome
instead
is
she
to
explain
words
o
joseph
chamberlain
i
that
yankee
lady
rhyme
an
then
i
took
my
coat
an
i
read
some
drivel
in
my
time
but
nothink
quite
so
bad
as
that
she
was
a
himport
i
suppose
dumped
down
by
foes
o
poor
ole
joe
i
took
the
kids
to
drury
lane
an
a
lion
comic
sing
a
song
as
told
us
once
again
to
keep
thinks
i
but
if
that
so
ca
we
protect
ourselves
from
joe
i
ai
knows
a
peaceful
life
is
wot
i
choose
if
people
likes
this
scheme
o
joe
they
more
than
welcome
to
their
views
they
loves
dear
food
i
not
a
doubt
an
that
their
but
when
i
seeks
the
door
at
one
of
them
there
public
shows
i
does
pay
a
bob
or
more
to
about
this
plan
o
joe
i
simply
wants
to
get
away
from
controversies
of
the
day
we
enough
o
argument
at
on
tube
or
train
an
most
on
us
be
content
if
entertain
but
joe
as
bad
as
the
perlice
wo
give
no
one
any
peace
an
seems
to
me
as
plain
as
day
it
actors
business
to
amuse
if
they
ca
keep
away
from
giving
us
their
fiscal
views
why
should
the
public
be
denied
a
chance
to
the
other
side
i
it
wo
be
very
long
afore
george
robey
lets
us
a
really
fiscal
song
wrote
by
the
dook
o
devonsheer
while
on
the
biograph
we
sees
them
comic
cuts
o
if
ruddy
kipling
would
but
write
a
free
trade
ballad
or
a
glee
which
arthur
roberts
could
recite
or
dunville
sing
with
tree
i
pay
my
money
at
the
door
nor
would
ask
for
nothin
more
but
while
the
descend
to
nothing
but
protection
there
other
better
ways
to
spend
the
little
money
that
i
earns
i
only
asks
to
see
an
failin
that
i
stop
away
i
likes
my
glass
of
nor
need
make
no
bones
about
it
but
still
i
ai
the
bloke
to
chaff
them
fellers
as
can
do
without
it
i
pities
but
i
respex
toteetallers
o
heither
sex
i
used
to
be
the
same
myself
would
never
touch
a
thing
but
water
nor
no
bottles
on
my
shelf
containin
wot
they
did
oughter
o
water
now
i
the
sight
except
to
wash
in
sunday
night
an
wot
cured
me
o
temperance
was
neither
tracts
nor
indigestion
but
simply
that
i
read
by
chance
some
dry
statistics
on
the
question
which
proved
to
me
beyond
a
doubt
that
lamps
as
was
oiled
went
out
in
them
dark
moments
o
the
war
of
nineteen
now
i
writing
my
country
raised
a
mounted
corps
as
seed
a
deal
o
gallant
fighting
an
nigh
a
third
of
all
that
lot
was
touched
by
fever
shell
or
shot
of
the
toteetallers
as
went
wot
boasted
o
their
sober
as
much
as
per
took
fever
bad
an
died
like
rabbits
while
out
o
them
as
liquored
free
we
did
lose
but
when
them
statistics
first
i
nobody
could
hacted
quicker
i
to
the
the
third
an
simply
dosed
myself
wi
liquor
since
then
a
many
orgies
i
wi
them
there
royal
georges
an
only
yesterday
i
the
state
o
things
as
existed
o
them
volunteers
there
was
only
enlisted
when
fell
sick
an
orf
went
made
that
per
yes
figures
proves
you
hanythink
to
suit
your
private
way
o
thinking
they
proves
the
blessedness
o
drink
or
else
they
proves
the
curse
o
drinking
an
if
you
manages
right
they
proves
that
black
is
white
they
proves
that
british
industries
is
being
ruined
by
the
they
proves
this
year
as
ever
is
to
be
wot
people
calls
a
an
when
on
exports
they
begin
lor
wot
a
muddle
they
gets
in
they
proves
as
the
iron
trade
is
prosperous
or
else
declining
that
more
or
less
was
never
made
by
them
as
is
engaged
in
mining
we
gets
a
varied
mental
meal
served
up
to
us
on
plates
o
steel
they
proves
without
the
slightest
doubt
our
manufacturies
is
growin
they
proves
we
being
quite
cut
out
or
else
that
our
trade
in
which
they
ai
so
wrong
it
goin
strong
but
there
some
undisputed
fac
an
even
figures
wo
gainsay
it
one
is
if
you
puts
on
a
tax
someone
or
other
to
pay
it
tax
the
poor
man
corn
says
joe
touch
bread
oh
dear
me
no
if
england
needs
our
pounds
an
pence
an
taxes
of
our
food
to
raise
it
do
require
much
to
see
as
the
consumer
pays
the
thing
i
anxious
for
to
learn
is
wot
does
get
in
return
when
prices
they
goes
up
a
bit
the
rich
exchequer
of
the
nation
is
bound
in
honour
to
remit
somethink
by
way
o
compensation
tho
all
the
same
i
like
to
see
the
bloke
as
talks
of
to
an
that
a
ticklish
game
to
win
we
stay
exactly
where
we
are
if
them
blooming
furrin
goods
comes
in
in
spite
of
our
protective
tariff
but
we
keep
out
sez
you
then
where
our
promised
revenoo
if
that
the
price
as
must
be
paid
to
forward
joe
imperial
mission
if
we
must
bolster
up
our
trade
an
not
allow
no
competition
by
taxing
them
as
to
buy
our
british
trade
sez
i
it
does
matter
if
i
goes
inside
our
local
workman
club
to
a
game
o
dominoes
or
drops
into
the
nearest
pub
in
a
moment
in
walk
some
bloke
as
starts
a
fiscal
talk
an
if
i
ever
tries
to
criticise
this
scheme
o
joe
there
always
some
excited
chaps
as
leads
from
arguments
to
blows
an
then
we
throws
the
things
about
till
someone
calls
the
they
states
that
england
gone
to
pot
that
trade
is
lost
to
an
if
i
dares
to
say
it
not
they
calls
me
englander
on
one
i
to
use
my
fist
said
i
was
a
nor
yet
it
ai
no
furrin
foes
as
thus
belittles
britain
fame
it
partisans
o
good
old
as
brings
discredit
on
name
by
shouting
out
to
that
little
england
day
is
done
one
night
jim
adams
sez
to
me
england
rotten
to
the
core
an
when
finds
i
do
agree
ups
an
calls
me
a
i
a
word
or
two
with
still
in
is
jim
if
them
imperialists
is
blokes
as
runs
their
country
down
upon
ruined
state
insists
an
tries
to
blacken
renown
then
i
for
one
much
prefer
to
be
a
englander
if
wot
their
politicians
styles
the
point
of
view
is
saying
that
these
british
isles
lost
their
trade
an
credit
too
i
ai
a
patriot
no
more
i
just
a
hoptimist
i
not
the
sort
o
chap
as
blames
them
folks
as
do
agree
wi
me
but
when
they
calls
me
silly
names
because
my
fiscal
views
is
free
it
do
require
no
further
flaws
to
see
the
weakness
o
their
cause
a
message
from
broadmoor
altho
my
brain
is
sound
and
well
an
mentally
i
nothing
wrong
they
locked
me
in
a
padded
cell
an
watches
me
the
day
long
did
i
get
in
such
a
fix
was
all
along
o
politics
i
studied
joe
protection
plan
an
thought
i
see
what
i
could
do
to
benefit
my
by
practisin
view
that
exports
is
the
all
in
all
and
himports
should
be
nil
or
small
so
when
i
stayed
with
uncle
bill
my
visit
ai
improved
manners
i
managed
when
i
left
to
fill
my
pockets
with
best
the
cigarettes
i
left
was
quite
the
cheapest
i
could
find
yet
uncle
bill
could
see
that
since
exports
far
exceeded
himports
thanks
o
course
to
me
that
was
exactly
what
he
needed
to
make
prosperous
again
merely
said
i
was
insane
could
understand
wot
more
was
a
cobdenite
an
still
is
why
when
i
traded
at
the
door
hovercoat
for
weary
willie
not
the
tramp
been
the
gainer
and
yet
could
anythink
be
plainer
one
day
a
foreign
merchant
fleet
was
anchored
orf
a
british
pier
the
cargo
mostly
russian
wheat
designed
for
himportation
true
to
my
principles
that
night
i
blew
it
up
with
dynamite
the
jury
was
a
set
o
twelve
old
fossils
o
the
asquith
school
the
judge
was
one
they
ought
to
shelve
my
counsel
was
a
bloomin
fool
talked
o
my
brain
an
never
mentioned
chamberlain
so
now
they
sent
me
to
a
spot
congenial
to
my
fiscal
notions
which
as
i
need
say
is
not
the
same
as
devonsheer
or
goschen
but
i
not
mad
i
must
insist
i
merely
a
protectionist
the
turning
tide
jim
was
a
tory
ten
years
back
an
cheered
at
each
tory
win
an
stand
an
argue
as
white
was
black
for
to
them
tories
in
but
times
an
parties
is
changed
since
then
an
wishful
to
out
agen
sez
you
maybe
that
true
nor
ai
the
only
one
as
wot
them
tories
they
do
an
as
seed
wot
them
tories
an
do
feel
noways
bound
do
jim
to
blokes
as
broke
their
word
with
nursed
party
a
many
a
year
an
swollered
their
party
tricks
just
draw
up
a
cheer
to
the
fire
an
wot
they
promised
the
likes
of
an
i
tell
you
arterwards
if
i
can
wot
the
tories
for
the
chamberlain
was
the
fust
to
speak
an
o
course
spoke
cocksure
of
a
pension
of
a
crown
a
week
for
the
old
poor
an
many
a
cap
was
raised
to
joe
when
made
that
promise
ten
year
ago
balfour
nex
to
the
comes
with
a
scheme
for
to
improve
them
in
crowded
slums
where
there
war
no
room
to
move
an
many
a
was
kep
alive
by
the
thought
o
that
promise
o
then
come
a
plan
for
to
keep
away
them
furriners
orf
our
shores
we
no
use
for
the
likes
o
they
wi
the
crowds
at
our
doors
but
our
english
workmen
is
still
denied
an
our
english
waiters
can
wait
outside
ten
year
ago
that
were
such
schemes
is
a
trifle
flat
was
as
i
need
say
when
they
promised
the
likes
o
that
an
our
unemployed
in
their
thousands
swarm
an
our
poor
law
waits
for
the
pledged
reform
ten
year
ago
that
were
an
yet
we
with
eye
our
starve

stunted
children
die

late

i
would
be
on
them
tory
chaps
no
doubt
as
they
done
their
best
but
i
ca
thinkin
they
be
none
the
worst
of
a
rest
that
majority
makes
slow
let
alone
all
the
trouble
they
with
joe
it
easy
to
sneer
when
you
once
begins
an
it
easy
to
badger
an
blame
when
the
is
and
the
is
very
like
they
be
just
the
same
no
better
but
at
least
no
wuss
an
they
ca
very
well
do
for
us
wot
can
this
show
but
them
promises
throwed
aside
an
a
country
confidence
washed
away
on
the
ebb
of
a
tory
tide
ten
long
years
since
they
fust
began
ten
good
years

to
plot
an

at
