violins
it
really
meant
for
boys
at
school

can
also
come

together

handkerchief
stuck
grandly
in

awfully
excitable
his
wrists
are
very
strong
he
drags
you
up
and
down
the
room
whenever
you
go
wrong
and
when
you
going
very
wrong
the
girls
begin
to
laugh

him
enormous
pain
the
floor
is
very
slippery

difficult
to
walk
from
one
end
to
the
other
end
unless
you
sort
of
stalk
and
when
the
steps
have
all
been
done
he
takes
you
by
the
arm
to
choose
a
partner
for
the
dance
it
makes
you
get
quite
warm
you
have
to
bow
and
look
polite
and
ask
with
a
grimace
the
pleasure
of
the
next
quadrille
and
slouch
into
your
place
he
always
picks
out
girls
you
hate
i
really
do
know
why
and
when
you
look
across
the
room
it
almost
makes
you
cry
to
see
the
girl
you
would
have
picked
dance
with
another
boy
without
a
single
smile
for
you
determined
to
annoy
your
heart
beats
very
loud
and
quick
your
breath
comes
very
fast
you
pinch
your
partner
in
the
chain
but
dances
end
at
last
you
think
you
will
not
look
at
her
you
look
the
other
way
yet
when
she
beckons
with
her
fan
you
instantly
obey
how
quick
the
evening
gallops
by
and
eight
comes
soon

not

pond
is
a
fine
pond
with
fine
ships
sailing
there
cutters
yachts
and
and
everywhere

anything
illustration
the
round

it
was
the
schooner
set
out
one
saturday
the
wind
was
blowing
from
the
east
the
sky
was
cold
and
grey
her
crew
stood
on
the
and
stared
across
the
sea
with
two
brass
cannon
in
the
stern
for
the
royal
artillery
the
royal
tin
artillery
had
faced
the
sea
before
they
had
fallen
in
the
bath
one
night
and
heard
the
roar
they
were
rescued
by
the
nursery
maid
and
put
on
the
ledge
to
dry
and
they
looked
more
like
the
volunteers
than
the
royal
artillery
for
the
blue
had
all
come
off
their
clothes
and
they
afterwards
wore
grey
but
they
stood
by
the
cannon
like
marines
that
famous
saturday
the
crew
of
the
schooner
were
dutchmen
to
a
man
with
wooden
legs
and
painted
eyes
but
the
captain
he
was
bran
his
blood
was
of
the
brownest
bran
and
his
clothes
were
full
of
tucks
but
he
fell
in
the
sea
across
and
was
eaten
up
by
ducks
we
launched
the
boat
at
three
and
stood
on
the
bank
to
watch
and
some
friends
of
mine
who
were
fishing
there
had
a
wonderful
fifteen
minnows
were
caught
at
once
in
an
ancient
ginger
jar
when
a
shout
went
up
that
the
was
heeling
over
too
far
too
far
for
a
ship
that
was
warranted
not
to
upset
but
she
righted
herself
in
half
a
tick
though
the
crew
got
very
wet
the
crew
got
very
wet
indeed
the
artillery
all
fell
down
and
lay
on
their
backs
for
the
rest
of
the
voyage
for
fear
they
were
going
to
drown
the
schooner
sailed
on
across
the
wild
round
pond
and
we
ran
along
the
with
a
hook
stuck
into
a
wand
a
hook
stuck
into
a
wand
to
guide
the
schooner
safe
ashore
to
incandescent
harbour
lights
and
a
dock
on
the
floor
but
suddenly
the
wind
dropped
dead
and
a
calm
came
over
the
sea
and
a
terrible
rumour
got
abroad
it
was
time
to
go
home
to
tea
we
whistled
loud
we
whistled
long
the
whole
of
that
afternoon
but
there
was
wind
enough
to
float
a
twopenny
pink
balloon
and
the
other
chaps
upon
the
bank
looked
anxiously
out
to
sea
for
their
sweethearts
and
sisters
were
going
home
and
they
feared
for
the
cake
at
tea
it
was
the
schooner
came
in
at
dead
of
night
with
many
another
gallant
ship
and
one
unlucky
kite
the
keeper
found
them
at
break
of
day
and
locked
them
up
quite
dry
in
his
little
green
hut
with
a
notice
that
on
monday
we
must
apply
so
on
sunday
after
church
we
went
to
stare
at
them
through
the
door
and
we
saw
the
schooner
keel
upwards
on
the
floor
but
though
we
stood
on
the
tips
of
our
toes
and
craned
our
necks
to
see
we
could
not
spot
the
crew
or
the
royal
artillery

their

are
pink

but
this
i
know
that
if
they
slept
far
far
away
from
owls
and
bats
their
hearts
would
thump
tremendously
to
hear
outside
two
fighting
cats
two
cats
that
surely
must
come
through

summer
holidays
when
i
was
small
and
went
to
bed
before
the
sun
went
down
my
cot
was
woven
out
of
gold
like
a
princess
gown
and
in
the
garden
every
night
i
used
to
hear
the
birds
and
from
the
people
on
the
lawn
a
pleasant
sound
of
words
the
garden
was
quite
full
of
pinks
whose
smell
came
blowing
in
through
windows
open
very
wide
where
gnats
would
dance
and
spin
and
as
i
lay
in
my
cool
cot
i
think
of
daylight
hours
poppies
and
daisies
white
and
all
the
roadside
flowers
now
lifting
up
their
drooping
heads
in
the
time
i
listen
for
my
mother
step
the
narrow
stairs
to
climb
and
as
she
bent
to
say
and
heard
me
say
my
prayer
she
seemed
a
bit
of
mignonette
she
was
so
sweet
and
fair
and
just
as
i
was
dozing
off
i
hear
some
jolly
talk
of
aunts
and
uncles
setting
out
to
take
their
i
hear
their
voices
die
away
in
the
green
curly
lane
but
i
was
always
fast
asleep
when
they
came
back
again
illustration
the
unpleasant
moon
the
moon
is
not
much
use
to
me
she
rises
far
too
late
i
fonder
of
the
friendly
fire
that
crackles
in
the
grate
but
when
i
wake
up
in
the
night
and
find
the
fire
asleep
his
ashes
make
a
horrid
noise
and
mice
begin
to
creep
and
then
the
moon
crawls
in
between
the
curtains
and
the
floor
and
when
i
turn
my
face
away
she
crawling
round
the
door
oh
then
i
wish
she
was
the
fire
i
like
his
light
the
most
he
does
not
give
the
furniture
a
sort
of
shaking
ghost
i
hide
my
head
beneath
the
clothes
and
shut
my
eyes
up
tight
and
then
i
see
queer
dancing
wheels
and
spots
of
coloured
light
they
do
not
comfort
me
at
all
but
pass
the
time
away
until
i
hear
the
milkman
can
and
know
that
it
is
day

suggestions
about
sleep
i
heard
it
said
that
the
dustman
is
responsible
for
our
sleep
that
he
puts
a
pinch
of
dust
in
our
eyes
when
the
stars
begin
to
peep
if
this
is
true
it
would
quite
explain
the
horrible
dreams
that
come
for
the
dustman
looks
a
rough
sort
of
chap
and
his
cart
smells
awfully
rum
illustration
the
dustman
i
tried
to
talk
to
the
dustman
but
his
voice
is
fearfully
hoarse
and
once
i
put
a
penny
in
the
bin
it
was
taken
out
of
course
but
for
all
the
good
it
did
my
dreams
i
need
not
have
put
it
in
perhaps
he
thought
that
the
penny
had
slipped
by
accident
into
the
bin
it
seems
absurd
in
this
civilised
age
g
that
our
dreams
should
still
be
bad
if
the
dustman
responsible
i
think
he
must
be
mad
it
horrid
enough
to
lie
awake
and
count
the
knobs
on
the
bed
but
it
horrider
far
to
go
to
sleep
in
fact
i
sooner
be
dead
i
expect
that
then
if
one
had
bad
dreams
and
woke
up
in
a
fright
there
would
be
an
angel
somewhere
about
to
strike
a
cheerful
light
and
your
governess
is
not
always
glad
if
you
wake
her
up
to
say
that
a
witch
has
been
chasing
you
down
a
street
where
the
people
have
gone
away
g
father
said
this
about
something
illustration
the
rare
burglar
it
extremely
unusual
my
mother
declares
for
a
burglar
to
sleep
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
the
policemen
she
says
are
so
terribly
sure
that
daily
the
number
of
burglars
gets
fewer
they
are
caught
by
the
dozen
as
morning
comes
round
and
dragged
off
to
cells
very
deep
underground
and
there
they
repent
of
their
wicked
bad
lives
with
occasional
visits
from
children
and
wives
so
every
night
when
i
lie
in
my
bed
i
listen
to
hear
the
policeman

the
german
band
i
love
to
lie
in
bed
and
hear
the
jolly
german
band
why
people
do
not
care
for
it
i
can
not
understand
they
do
not
mind
the
orchestra
and
that
makes
far
more
noise
they
quite
forget
that
music
is
a
thing
that
one
enjoys
when
people
come
and
call
i
have
to
play
for
them
and
once
a
deaf
old
lady
said
my
playing
was
a
gem
but
it
not
true
for
them
to
say
the
carnival
de
venise
h
with
three
wrong
notes
is
better
than
a
band
that
plays
with
ease
it
comes
each
week
at
eight
and
when
i
hear
it
play
i
am
a
knight
upon
a
horse
and
riding
far
away
the
lines
upon
the
blanket
are
six
armies
marching
past
six
armies
marching
on
a
plain
six
armies
marching
fast
of
course
i
am
the
general
i
riding
at
the
head
but
suddenly
the
music
stops
and
then
i
back
in
bed
each
time
it
plays
brings
different
thoughts
exciting
sad
and
good
i
sailing
in
a
sailing
ship
i
walking
in
a
wood
i
going
to
the
pantomime
i
at
the
hippodrome
but
when
the
music
stops
why
then
i
always
am
at
home
in
winter
when
it
dark
at
eight
the
jolly
german
band
drives
all
unpleasant
thoughts
away
just
like
a
in
summer
when
it
light
at
eight
the
german
band
still
plays
it
makes
me
think
of
pleasant
things
and
seaside
holidays
i
heard
that
it
plays
out
of
tune
and
upsets
talking
and
i
heard
it
called
a
nuisance
but
i
love
the
german
band

this
is
beastly
difficult
and
almost
so
decent

the
deceitful

postman
has
given
a
loud
perhaps
it

parcel
for
me

go
slowly
to
open
the
door
and
see
oh
dear
it
only
a
telegram
to
wait
on

hall
till
father
comes

the
evening
or

comes

wonder
if
an
animal
lives
in
the

when
the
postman
opens
it
you
see
a
cage
with
locks
and
surely
letters
do
not
want
a
cage
with
bars
and
clamps
they
have
no
wings
they
could
not
fly
they
held
by
sticky
stamps
perhaps
the
postman
keeps
a
pet
a
savage
beast
of
prey
for
lions
seals
and
are
fed
three
times
a
day
and
all
those
figures
on
the
plate
are
meant
perhaps
for
you
to
learn
what
time
the
beast
is
fed
like
others
at
the
zoo
and
now
i
come
to
think
of
it
the
postman
coat
and
hat
is
not
unlike
a
keeper
who
feeds
animals
with
fat
besides
he
always
shuts
the
door
with
a
tremendous
bang
as
if
he
feared
to
see
stick
out
an
irritable
fang
but
then
again
i
never
heard
the
faintest
roar
or
squeak
i
never
saw
a
sniffing
nose
or
spied
a
hooky
beak
so
after
all
perhaps
there
not
a
bird
a
beast
or
snake
and
yet
i
shall
post
a
slice
of
illustration
the
fortunate
coalmen
it
is
a
pleasant
thing
to
watch
the
coalmen
at
their
work
they
do
not
seem
to
mind
the
dark
where
many
dangers
lurk
the
braver
of
them
goes
below
into
the
cellar
black
and
calls
out
in
a
cheerful
voice
to
bring
another
sack
the
other
grunts
and
groans
a
lot
beneath
his
load
of
coal
and
down
the
ladder
goes
with
care
until
he
gains
the
hole
he
turns
his
burden
upside
down
the
inside
rattles
out
and
a
delicious
smell
of
coal
gets
everywhere
about
the
braver
one
takes
up
his
spade
and
shovels
it
away
the
other
wipes
his
shiny
face
and
asks
the
time
of
day
but
it
is
very
strange
to
me
that
neither
seems
to
want
to
put
the
ladder
down
the
hole
and
climb
down
where
i
ca
a
man
they
say
once
broke
his
leg
by
falling
down
a
grating
and
nearly
died
for
want
of
food
because
they
kept
him
waiting
a
week
before
they
pulled
him
out
and
took
him
to
his
home
from
which
he
never
more
went
forth
the
london
streets
to
roam
but
coalmen
do
not
run
these
risks
they
have
no
nurse
to
frown
so
they
might
spend
the
whole
long
day
in
climbing
up
and
down
i
i
they
are
silly
not
to
illustration
the
pavement

i
think
that
i
should
like
to
be
a
pavement

for
he
has
every
kind
of
chalk
spread
in
a
cosy
nest
i

ten
pieces

these
are

he
has
a

different
shades
and
most
uncommon
sorts
he
can
draw
salmon
queens
and
chops

mutinies
and
forts
his
cannon
have
enormous
puffs
of
the
most
curly
smoke
because
he
has
so
many
far
more

other
folk
his
girls
are
a
delicious
pink
and
mine
are
rather
pale
but
then
i
have
to
be
more
strict
for
fear
my
pink
should
fail
his
fields
have
got
a
splendid
green
they
full
of
flowers
bright
but
mine
are
covered
up
with
snow
because
my
paper
white
and
yet
with
all
these
jolly
chalks
the
artist
seems
in
pain
perhaps
because
his
pictures
get
rubbed
out
by
showers
of
rain
but
what
i
can
not
understand
is
why
each
has
not
a
drawing
on
its
face
why
such
a
few
are
done
our
walks
would
be
much
pleasanter
if
all
the
dullest
streets
were
illustrated
like
a
book
and
gay
as
flags
or
sweets
of
course
a
lot
would
get
all
smudged

some
would
tread

poking

and
picking
out
the
best

from
his

a
baked
potato
on
a

is
very
like
a

i
always
think
of
them
again
long
after
when
i
gone
to
bed
i
bought
one
coming
home
from
school
and
as
i
turned
into
our
street
the
in
the
yellow
fog
sailed
like
a
wicked
pirate
fleet
and
all
the
people
in
the
fog
were
upon
a
quay
the
pavement
smelt
of
tar
and
salt
i
thought
i
heard
quite
close
the
sea
i
heard
a
whisper
as
i
went
jolly
roger
at
the
peak
a
bullfinch
in
a
lighted
room
was
a
parrot
in
a
creek
the
at
was
susan
and
beyond
the
was
a
the
was
marooned
and
as
i
got
close
to
our
house
i
was
an
english
midshipman
my
satchel
was
an
old
my
a
and
then
a
wondrous
thing
occurred
the
strangest
thing
i
ever
knew
i
found
a
shining
sixpence
though
i
do
suppose
you
think
it
true
i
hardly
dared
to
look
at
it
afraid
that
it
would
only
prove
a
bit
of
tin
a
bovril
coin
and
not
a
proper
i
told
my
brother
and
he
thought
we
better
hide
it
out
of
sight
in
case
the
pirates
should
attack
our
bedroom
on
that
foggy
night
the
baked
potato
in
my
coat
was
just
exactly
captain
kidd
so
both
of
us
declared
at
once
that
there
the
sixpence
must
be
hid
we
took
our
sister
and
put
his
clothes
upon
a
stick
and
spent
the
evening
doing
this
instead
of
my
arithmetic
we
made
a
glorious
of
prussian
blue
we
put
the
pirate
on
the
stick
and
stuck
the
sixpence
first
with
glue
deep
in
my
mother
next
day
we
buried
captain
kidd
my
sister
never
could
find
out
where
all
her
were
hid
we
made
a
map
to
show
the
place
and
wrote
directions
in
red
ink
but
when
we
dug
the
treasure
up
i
dropped
it
down
the
kitchen
sink

raining
every

the

full

paths
i
sent
out
there

full

dark
it
like

sort

i
walk
about
the
paths
alone
and
look
at
roots
and
leaves
and
once
behind
a
laurel
bush
i
saw
a
pierrot
k
sleeves
i
thought
of
him
that
night
in
bed
i
was
afraid
he
climb
and
peep
against
the
and
say
a
horrid
rhyme
and
when
i
heard
the
rain
outside
dripping
upon
the
sill
i
thought
i
heard
his
footsteps
too
and
oh
i
did
lie
still
k
like
one
in
my
aunt
french
i
saw
his
shadow
dance
about
like
a
shadow
on
a
sheet
i
saw
his
eyes
like
currants
black
and
his
white
velvet
feet

house
is

servants
never

goes

stay
there

got
a
woolly
smell

full

little
things
tall
clocks
and
fat
blue
china
bowls
and
birds
with
coloured
wings
i
tinkle
all
the
candlesticks
upon
the
mantelpiece
they
wave
long
after
i
have
gone
and
never
seem
to
cease

is
full
of
shawls
with
footstools
everywhere
and
prickly
cushions
stuck
upright
upon
each
bristly
chair

i
go
home

it
is
not
time
for

although
the
night
is
marching
up
and
i
can
hardly
see
i
reading
in
the
library
in
a
most
enormous
chair
the
fire
is
just
the
very
kind
that
makes
you
want
to
stare
i
looking
at
the
largest
book
that
ever
yet
was
seen
they
say
i
shall
not
understand
this
tale
till
i
fourteen
don
quixote
is
the
name
of
it
with
pictures
on
each
page
the
way
that
he
was
treated
puts
me
in
a
fearful
rage
don
quixote
was
a
tall
thin
man
whose
thoughts
were
just
like
mine
he
saw
queer
things
he
heard
queer
sounds
though
he
was
more
than
nine
he
used
to
lie
in
bed
and
watch
the
hilly
counterpane
and
see
strange
little
go
riding
down
a
plain
his
room
was
simply
crowded
with
enchanters
dwarfs
and
elves
and
dragons
used
to
go
to
sleep
upon
the
darkest
shelves
he
used
to
think
that
common
things
were
really
very
strange
like
me
who
saw
a
goblin
once
upon
our
he
saw
big
giants
in
the
clouds
marching
and
fighting
there
he
used
to
listen
to
the
leaves
and
think
it
was
a
bear
he
found
some
armour
that
belonged
to
people
long
ago
and
rode
away
to
fight
and
save
princesses
from
the
foe
but
every
one
behaved
to
him
as
if
they
were
his
nurse
they
said
he
was
and
they
said
he
was
a
curse
he
used
to
play
at
and
charge
a
flock
of
sheep
he
used
to
read
in
bed
at
night
instead
of
going
to
sleep
there
was
not
anything
of
which
he
could
not
make
a
game
he
must
have
been
a
jolly
chap
don
quixote
was
his
name
he
had
adventures
every
day
he
simply
made
them
come
but
all
his
family
shook
their
heads
and
said
that
he
was
rum
they
burnt
his
books
they
shut
him
up
they
threw
enormous
stones
some
beastly
fellows
beat
him
too
and
almost
broke
his
bones
it
makes
me
simply
furious
it
makes
me
cry
to
see
him
lying
in
the
road
i
hope
he
will
not
die
he
did
not
mean
to
misbehave
he
wanted
just
to
play
some
people
think
my
games
are
bad
they
did
the
other
day
a
cousin
came
to
stay
with
us
