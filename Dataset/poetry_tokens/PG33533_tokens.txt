farewell
ye
partner
of
my
woes
farewell
the
finest
language
could
but
faintly
tell
what
i
now
feel
in
writing
this
adieu
what
you
must
suffer
when
far
from
you
there
was
a
time
when
happiness
my
lot
i
serenely
in
my
little
cot
no
wicked
thoughts
did
there
disturb
my
rest
my
children
round
me
by
a
father
prest
no
father
now
methinks
i
hear
them
say
gone
from
us
hurried
far
away
nightly
them
in
my
dreams
seen
their
wet
eyes
and
heard
their
dreadful
screams
methought
my
wife
came
to
my
lonely
cell
to
say
adieu
to
bid
a
long
farewell
soon
i
awoke
and
to
increase
my
pains
i
felt
my
legs
round
with
chains
then
then
i
cried
oh
drunkenness
thou
cause
of
this
distress
and
made
me
break
those
laws
that
wise
men
made
for
every
man
to
keep
by
them
deluded
in
crimes
so
deep
first
step
to
ruin
was
a
love
of
dice
with
cards
the
great
promoter
of
our
vice
i
wish
those
men
who
do
with
such
things
play
would
ever
cast
them
from
their
hands
away
i
wish
all
magistrates
would
search
around
and
punish
publicans
where
they
are
found
they
caused
me
first
my
master
to
neglect
and
after
lost
me
honest
respect
they
also
led
me
from
a
virtuous
wife
and
mostly
caused
my
lad
disgrace
and
strife
view
public
houses
every
wealthy
squire
and
force
by
ten
the
spendthrift
to
retire
by
such
a
plan
the
labouring
poor
would
rise
soon
as
the
sun
adorns
the
heavenly
skies
stated
what
have
brought
me
to
this
end
and
what
has
lost
me
every
earthly
friend
except
a
god
protect
and
bless
her
and
our
offspring
now
in
great
distress
young
men
be
cautious
how
ye
spend
your
time
a
bad
acquaintance
hurries
on
a
crime
sometimes
an
artful
female
tries
her
power
to
trap
the
giddy
in
a
thoughtless
hour
when
she
has
the
captive
to
her
will
she
gladly
sees
your
taking
pill
cause
you
to
leave
a
virtuous
homely
wife
and
lead
a
sad
disgraceful
wicked
life
by
art
bring
you
to
distress
and
like
a
millwood
to
you
falsely
press
then
be
the
first
your
actions
to
betray
a
fiend
like
such
me
to
go
astray
from
them
i
love
from
those
my
heart
hold
dear
and
shall
till
death
their
memories
revere
when
i
am
in
transport
on
the
sea
doubtless
my
love
sometimes
sigh
for
me
bring
up
my
little
ones
in
such
a
way
as
they
will
holy
keep
the
early
in
life
do
in
their
minds
reveal
the
dreadful
crimes
to
swear
to
lie
or
steal
hannah
my
eldest
daughter
place
her
where
constant
under
eye
and
care
let
her
not
learn
the
weaving
trade
find
that
such
a
course
may
injure
much
her
mind
females
are
ready
to
acquire
that
art
soon
as
they
wish
fair
virtue
to
depart
unwilling
oft
in
service
for
to
be
where
they
dress
and
have
their
liberty
but
if
with
parents
they
can
work
at
home
nightly
they
hope
with
idle
folks
to
roam
at
my
late
sentence
i
can
not
complain
the
law
my
body
do
detain
justice
slow
has
overtaken
me
abroad
for
life
i
shall
be
kept
from
thee
on
a
just
god
for
ever
i
will
trust
i
know
his
will
is
always
right
and
just
tis
now
too
late
again
to
speak
to
you
which
is
the
cause
of
writing
this
adieu
no
partner
now
to
sooth
my
aching
heart
reflection
galls
me
at
myself
i
start
with
aching
heart
and
in
my
lonely
cell
i
bid
my
babes
and
you
long
farewell
methinks
i
see
the
transport
full
in
view
and
i
with
horror
meet
the
crew
full
well
i
know
i
shall
see
you
more
nor
plant
a
on
my
native
shore
on
foreign
land
my
days
to
toil
and
with
vile
wretches
cultivate
the
soil
stripes
i
must
bare
perhaps
when
quite
unwell
and
hear
the
melancholy
yell
a
pang
i
feel
when
i
close
the
night
and
wish
a
virtuous
wife
was
in
my
sight
england
adieu
may
you
in
trade
increase
and
free
from
inward
tumults
rest
in
peace
our
chaplain
well
i
know
will
soon
impart
his
friendly
aid
to
cheer
the
drooping
heart
i
hope
my
children
he
will
learn
to
read
and
teach
them
early
to
peruse
the
creed
the
bell
is
rung
the
waggon
is
in
view
wife
and
dear
children
now
adieu
adieu
at
thoughts
of
leaving
this
my
native
shore
unmans
me
quite
and
i
can
say
no
more
i
will
life
a
better
course
pursue
far
away
shall
leave
my
heart
with
you
advice
vile
men
abstain
from
every
artful
plan
when
found
out
disgrace
the
name
of
man
let
those
who
steal
repent
and
sin
no
more
ere
law
decrees
vengeance
on
them
pour
from
trifling
things
we
greater
ills
pursue
till
the
fangs
are
brought
within
our
view
stop
stop
bad
courses
ere
it
be
too
late
and
justice
dooms
you
to
a
fate
riots
avoid
mischief
none
you
do
your
being
at
them
brings
a
stain
on
you
those
who
look
on
will
afterwards
repent
and
share
alike
in
point
of
punishment
the
law
expressly
properly
declare
he
adds
to
tumult
that
is
present
there
take
my
advice
let
reason
bear
her
sway
from
scenes
of
discord
always
keep
away
think
it
hard
a
worthless
savage
crew
should
gain
by
plunder
all
your
goods
from
you
the
worst
of
men
are
foremost
on
a
plan
to
gain
by
rapine
every
way
they
can
do
you
suppose
that
wasting
store
can
ease
the
hardships
of
the
labouring
poor
no
such
a
course
our
present
ills
increase
and
robs
the
nation
of
its
inward
peace
from
late
example
all
are
taught
to
know
dreadful
his
fate
that
strikes
blow
then
let
us
quiet
at
our
cots
remain
and
better
times
will
cheer
us
once
again
all
means
are
trying
comforts
to
restore
to
ease
the
hardships
of
the
labouring
poor
think
what
distress
awaits
dishonest
ways
in
prison
many
wretched
days
not
only
days
perhaps
they
shed
their
tears
in
foreign
lands
for
many
dismal
years
not
only
years
perhaps
are
for
life
abroad
to
roam
from
children
home
and
wife
should
it
your
lot
in
prison
for
to
be
implore
with
fervent
prayer
the
deity
who
will
in
time
if
you
sincerely
pray
lessen
your
troubles
each
succeeding
day
our
aid
that
we
should
crave
a
gracious
pardon
ere
we
meet
the
grave
his
intercession
with
the
king
of
kings
alone
can
save
you
from
eternal
stings
when
at
the
court
for
trial
you
appear
speak
nought
but
truth
you
better
for
it
fare
for
should
you
dare
to
introduce
a
lie
sharp
eye
each
falsehood
will
descry
known
a
witness
brought
to
swear
the
guilty
felon
of
his
crime
is
clear
he
feels
alas
too
late
such
impious
conduct
greatly
aggravate
besides
he
answers
at
the
awful
day
for
causing
others
from
the
truth
to
stray
whatever
happens
in
this
vale
of
tears
our
maker
knows
give
him
your
fervent
prayers
let
your
demeanor
if
in
prison
be
such
as
the
jailor
can
contrition
see
for
his
report
may
mitigate
your
doom
and
sometimes
save
you
from
a
gloom
religious
books
if
you
can
read
attend
they
are
in
solitude
the
friend
when
at
the
chapel
do
not
cast
away
by
inattention
what
the
chaplain
say
pure
religion
cheers
each
good
heart
and
will
in
time
its
blessings
soon
impart
such
as
perhaps
you
never
knew
before
and
doubtless
will
your
peace
of
mind
restore
the
bible
read
when
in
your
dismal
cell
read
it
attentive
ere
you
bid
farewell
to
him
who
may
companion
with
you
be
your
soul
that
night
may
be
required
of
thee
a
scene
i
witnessed
and
not
long
time
since
would
stop
the
errors
of
an
hardened
prince
three
men
were
by
the
law
to
die
to
hear
them
mourn
to
see
the
drooping
eye
would
cause
sensations
of
a
painful
kind
while
anxious
cares
corode
the
mind
a
pious
chaplain
strove
to
bring
in
view
the
pardon
if
repentants
true
he
said
that
god
was
merciful
and
just
to
implore
forgiveness
on
his
word
to
trust
there
is
a
record
where
the
scripture
say
those
that
repent
he
will
not
cast
away
a
sigh
or
tear
can
not
that
boon
impart
it
must
be
fervent
from
the
head
and
heart
aid
vile
sinners
doth
he
save
if
true
repentants
ere
they
meet
the
grave
each
they
could
recal
the
time
past
and
they
would
live
as
if
each
day
the
last
just
before
death
they
me
to
implore
an
erring
mortal
to
transgress
no
more
hope
their
chaplain
might
for
ever
be
when
on
high
blessed
to
eternity
they
knew
his
worth
his
heart
is
of
a
kind
that
plants
soft
pity
to
a
feeling
mind
deeker
as
chaplain
few
can
excel
by
all
who
bids
the
jail
farewell
when
first
i
saw
these
wretched
men
in
jail
before
their
trial
did
their
fate
bewail
soon
as
the
sentence
met
each
anxious
ear
and
true
repentants
did
appear
one
and
all
cried
out
oh
that
god
how
just
to
stop
our
sad
career
on
thee

one
