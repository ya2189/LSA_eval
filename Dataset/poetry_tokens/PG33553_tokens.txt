most
of
the
poems
contained

collection
are
of
recent
date
though
their
author
who
is

of
modern
languages
at
bishop
college
quebec
has
written
verse
from
his
childhood
he
is
the
first
canadian
writer
to
be
included
in
this
series
and
is
as
affectionately
loyal
to
the
motherland
as
to
his
native
country
as
may
be
gathered
from
his
song
of
the
homeland
his
verse
has
already
earned
a
considerable
reputation
in
canada
in
whose
press
much
of
it
has
appeared

stanstead
college
he
took
his
degree
at
the
university
where
he
now
lectures
and
has
also
studied
in
paris
marburg
and
switzerland
several
of
his
poems
are
concerned
with
the
sorrow
and
the
ravished
beauty
of
belgium
a
circumstance
not
surprising
as
he
has
travelled
much
in
that
country
as
well
as
in
france
switzerland
and
italy
a
lover
of
country
life
and
a
disciple
of
the
cult
of
the
open
road
he
revels
in
the
joys
of
camping
and
canoeing
as
one
of
his
poems
hidden
treasure
bears
witness
in
this
little
book
and
more
especially
in
the
song
of
the
homeland
he
shows
us
the
maple
leaf
entwined
strongly
as
ever
with
the
english
rose
of
the
mother
country
gertrude
ford
in
a
belgian
garden
once
in
a
belgian
garden
ah
many
months
ago
i
saw
like
pale
madonnas
the
tall
white
lilies
blow
great
poplars
swayed
and
trembled
afar
against
the
sky
and
green
with
flags
and
rushes
the
river
wandered
by
amid
the
waving
wheatfields
glowed
poppies
blazing
red
and
showering
strange
wild
music
a
lark
rose
overhead
the
lark
has
ceased
his
singing
the
wheat
is
trodden
low
and
in
the
garden
no
more
the
lilies
blow
and
where
green
poplars
trembled
stand
shattered
trunks
instead
and
lines
of
small
white
crosses
keep
guard
above
the
dead
for
here
brave
lads
and
noble
from
lands
beyond
the
deep
beneath
the
small
white
crosses
have
laid
them
down
to
sleep
they
laid
them
down
with
gladness
upon
the
alien
plain
that
this
same
belgian
garden
might
bud
and
bloom
again
a
lincolnshire
maiden
long
the
eastern
beaches
where
brown
the
seaweed
grows
and
over
broad
salt
meadows
the
green
tide
ebbs
and
flows
above
the
houses
two
ancient
towers
rise
and
stand
like
giant
druids
against
the
skies
through
mist
or
rain
or
sunshine
their
prows
festooned
with
foam
the
go
outward
or
laden
turn
them
home
she
watches
by
the
window
and
tearless
are
her
eyes
she
sees
not
church
or
tower
or
sea
or
skies
she
sees
not
tide
or
tempest
or
sun
or
mist
or
rain
afar
her
spirit
wanders
upon
the
belgian
plain
where
over
cities
the
mad
red
tempest
raves
and
poplars
sigh
and
shudder
above
unnumbered
graves
hidden
treasure
boy
with
the
wondering
eyes
do
you
see
the
blue
of
the
summer
skies
do
you
hear
the
song
of
the
drowsy
stream
as
it
winds
by
the
shore
where
the
birches
gleam
then
come
come
away
from
the
shadowy
bay
and
we
drift
with
the
stream
where
the
rapids
play
for
we
are
two
pirates
fierce
and
bold
and
we
capture
the
hoard
of
the
morning
gold
a
roving
craft
is
our
red
canoe
o
pirate
chief
with
the
eyes
of
blue
so
hoist
your
flag
with
the
skull
on
high
and
out
we
sail
where
the
treasures
lie
for
in
days
of
old
came
pirates
bold
a
spanish
galleon
captured
gold
and
their
boat
was
wrecked
on
the
river
strand
and
its
treasures
strewn
on
the
silver
sand
now
steady
all
as
we
dash
along
the
rapids
are
swift
but
our
paddles
are
strong
and
soon
we
drift
with
the
water
flow
where
the
treasure
lies
hid
in
the
shallows
below
oh
cool
and
dim
its
brim
is
the
pool
where
the
swallows
dip
and
skim
so
we
plunge
by
the
prow
of
our
red
canoe
for
the
treasure
that
lies
in
the
quivering
blue
now
home
once
more
to
the
shadowy
bay
for
we
captured
the
gold
of
the
summer
day
and
emeralds
green
from
the
banks
along
and
the
silver
bars
of
the
song
no
pirates
bore
such
a
glittering
store
from
the
treasure
ships
of
the
days
of
yore
as
the
spoils
we
have
won
on
the
shining
stream
while
we
drifted
along
in
a
golden
dream
a
river
sunset
red
sunlight
fades
from
wood
and
town
the
western
sky
is
gaunt
drift
silent
down
upon
the
river
gleaming
tide
the
hills
clear
outlines
melt
away
or
veil
themselves
in
purple
light
and
burning
thoughts
that
vexed
the
day
become
fair
visions
of
the
night
the
madonna
she
shivered
and
crouched
in
the
immigrant
shed
in
the
midst
of
the
surging
crowd
her
hands
were
warped
with
the
years
of
toil
and
her
young
form
bent
and
bowed
her
eyes
looked
forth
with
a
frightened
glance
at
the
throng
that
round
her
pressed
but
her
face
was
the
face
of
the
mother
of
god
as
she
looked
at
the
babe
on
her
breast
an
idol
in
a
shop
window
old
lohan
peers
through
the
dusty
glass
from
a
jumble
of
curios
quaint
and
rare
and
he
watches
the
hurrying
crowds
that
pass
the
whole
day
long
through
the
ancient
square
wrapped
in
his
robe
of
gold
and
jade
here
by
the
window
he
patiently
waits
for
the
sound
that
the
gongs
and
the
conches
made
in
the
days
of
old
at
the
temple
gates
he
heaves
no
sighs
and
he
sheds
no
tears
for
his
heart
is
bronze
and
he
does
not
know
that
his
temple
has
been
for
a
thousand
years
but
a
mound
of
dust
where
the
bamboos
grow
so
here
he
sits
through
the
nights
and
days
and
the
sun
goes
up
and
down
the
sky
but
he
often
looks
with
a
wistful
gaze
at
the
crowds
that
always
pass
him
by
and
his
eyes
half
closed
in
a
mystic
dream
of
his
of
long
ago
turn
back
to
the
shores
of
the
sacred
stream
and
the
kneeling
throng
he
used
to
know
but
he
sometimes
smiles
as
he
sees
the
crowd
of
human
folk
that
pass
him
by
then
he
wraps
himself
in
his
mystic
shroud
and
the
sun
once
more
goes
down
the
sky
through
a
long
cloister
through
a
long
cloister
where
the
gloom
of
night
lingers
in
sombre
silence
all
the
day
across
worn
pavements
crumbling
to
decay
we
wandered
blindly
groping
for
the
light
a
door
swung
wide
and
splendour
infinite
streamed
through
the
painted
glass
and
drove
away
the
lingering
gloom
from
choir
nave
and
bay
and
a
great
minster
glory
met
our
sight
blindly
along
life
cloister
do
we
grope
we
seek
a
gate
that
leads
to
life
immortal
we
see
it
loom
before
us
dim
and
vast
and
doubt
dark
shadows
veil
the
light
of
hope
when
lo
death
hand
flings
wide
the
sombre
portal
and
light
unfading
meets
our
gaze
at
last
the
chambly
rapid
there
a
spirit
in
the
rapid
calling
calling
through
the
night
there
a
gleam
upon
the
water
burning
pale
and
burning
bright
woe
to
him
who
hears
the
calling
woe
to
him
who
sees
the
light
my
son
and
i
had
left
jean
our
paddles
dipping
in
the
blue
and
many
miles
to
north
had
gone
along
the
silent
richelieu
the
night
came
down
we
thought
of
rest
a
threatening
cloud
hung
in
the
west
no
warning
sound
the
river
made
save
for
the
rapid
muffled
roar
as
the
deepening
shade
we
camped
upon
that
luckless
shore
no
sound
the
bore
to
me
save
one
weird
echo
from
chambly
the
night
grew
dark
and
darker
still
the
moon
was
hid
from
sight
when
the
waters
black
and
chill
we
saw
a
ghastly
gleaming
light
a
fitful
fire
pale
and
blue
that
burned
my
inmost
spirit
through
and
like
some
baleful
gleaming
eye
it
shone
beneath
night
heavy
pall
then
high
above
the
loon
lone
cry
afar
we
heard
the
spirit
call
it
called
us
from
the
other
shore
ah
jean
will
never
hear
it
more
i
could
not
seize
or
hold
him
back
for
while
the
light
burned
pale
and
blue
a
heavy
hand
from
out
the
black
held
me
beside
my
own
canoe
and
ere
i
stirred
the
other
barque
had
silent
sped
into
the
dark
adown
the
river
drifting
tide
to
where
the
wild
mad
rapids
run
past
towering
on
each
side
his
frail
canoe
had
drifted
on
he
did
not
look
to
left
or
right
but
gazed
upon
that
light
and
ever
swifter
with
the
flow
he
drifted
where
the
rapids
play
his
eyes
still
on
that
awful
glow
ah
god
my
life
seemed
snatched
away
i
saw
a
gleam
far
up
the
sky
and
heard
the
echo
of
a
cry
there
a
spirit
in
the
rapid
calling
calling
through
the
night
there
a
gleam
upon
the
water
burning
pale
and
burning
bright
woe
to
him
who
hears
the
calling
woe
to
him
who
sees
the
light
the
snowdrift
the
snowflakes
fell
on
a
mountain
peak
where
the
rocks
were
bare
and
the
winds
were
bleak
and
at
first
they
clung
to
the
mountain
breast
but
soon
they
fell
from
its
lofty
crest
and
stained
and
soiled
was
the
snow
when
it
reached
the
valley
far
down
below
but
up
on
the
height
one
drift
alone
still
firmly
clung
to
the
rugged
stone
and
men
in
the
gloomy
vale
below
looked
up
and
gazed
on
the
shining
snow
and
their
darkened
souls
drank
in
the
light
from
the
gleaming
snow
on
the
mountain
height
unstained
by
the
grime
of
the
earthly
vale
its
white
breast
firm
in
the
strongest
gale
it
bravely
clung
to
its
lofty
height
and
gleamed
afar
with
its
glorious
light
till
kissed
by
the
sun
and
the
summer
rain
it
rose
in
mist
to
the
skies
again
on
mount
royal
i
climb
its
sides
when
the
day
grows
old
and
its
mighty
shadow
falls
deep
and
wide
and
over
the
gleam
of
the
sunset
gold
the
darkness
creeps
like
a
rising
tide
and
higher
and
higher
up
rocky
height
past
oaks
that
are
gnarled
by
the
winter
blast
i
climb
till
a
marvellous
vision
of
light
breaks
forth
on
my
wondering
sight
at
last
dome
and
spire
of
house
of
prayer
convent
cloister
gloomy
and
gray
street
and
market
and
bridge
lie
there
in
the
golden
gleam
of
the
dying
day
yet
here
on
the
silent
mountain
crest
there
echoes
a
moan
and
a
smothered
roar
from
the
tide
of
life
in
its
strange
unrest
as
it
beats
below
on
a
barren
shore
the
vision
a
vision
came
unto
a
saint
of
old
of
a
fair
city
by
a
crystal
stream
its
gates
of
pearl
its
streets
of
shining
gold
barbaric
splendours
of
a
mystic
dream
there
upon
floating
wings
the
throng
no
man
can
number
chant
in
endless
song
across
the
tideless
sea
no
shadow
falls
to
dim
the
glory
of
the
sapphire
walls
or
mar
the
splendour
of
the
height
ah
love
the
mystic
vision
wakes
with
all
its
glittering
show
and
kingly
pride
no
longing
in
a
heart
unsatisfied
but
oh
to
walk
with
thee
the
river
shore
as
in
the
days
gone
by
the
gold
strewn
the
strand
of
primrose
bloom
the
water
flow
mingled
with
thy
sweet
voice
in
music
low
the
angel
song
to
touch
my
lips
to
thine
to
hear
the
whispering
of
thy
heart
to
mine
and
burning
with
a
fire
that
never
dies
to
see
once
more
the
in
thine
eyes
ah
dim
those
far
celestial
splendours
burn
gray
grow
the
sapphire
walls
and
ways
before
the
vision
of
thy
love
return
with
all
the
unuttered
joys
of
bygone
days
a
year
ago
the
waters
of
the
river
gleamed
as
brightly
and
murmured
with
the
same
untiring
flow
the
branches
of
the
birches
tossed
as
lightly
among
them
sang
the
breeze
as
soft
and
low
a
year
ago
we
sat
beneath
the
birches
bending
to
reach
the
gurgling
waters
of
the
bay
we
saw
the
boats
their
courses
seaward
wending
and
earth
seemed
fair
before
us
life
long
day
night
far
away
but
often
clouds
would
veil
the
sunlight
over
a
moment
cast
a
shadow
and
float
by
so
stealthily
above
our
hearts
would
hover
sad
thoughts
to
pause
a
moment
pass
and
die
we
knew
not
why
we
heeded
not
the
moaning
of
the
river
nor
did
the
wind
a
whispered
message
bring
ah
now
i
know
they
murmured
part
forever
for
that
dull
gloom
above
us
hovering
was
death
dark
wing
eternity
eternity
thou
dark
unbounded
sea
upon
whose
tide
we
drift
into
the
night
one
moment
let
us
with
our
mortal
sight
pierce
through
the
fogs
and
know
thy
mystery
voiceless
thou
art
and
voiceless
wilt
thou
be
across
thy
still
cold
deeps
there
comes
no
light
while
age
and
æon
or
a
moment
flight
pass
on
as
one
and
vanish
lost
in
thee
yet
onward
driven
must
our
frail
barques
go
though
through
the
night
no
beacon
gleams
afar
and
hide
the
steadfast
the
purpose
of
our
wandering
and
our
woe
a
tide
that
wafts
to
some
safe
harbour
bar
o
god
that
we
might
know
might
only
know
the
old
school
bell
i
can
hear
it
calling
calling
sounding
on
the
morning
breeze
as
so
often
i
have
heard
it
call
before
and
its
ringing
thrills
my
spirit
as
the
wind
the
whispering
trees
but
alas
i
know
for
me
it
calls
no
more
ah
how
sweet
the
memory
lingers
though
old
time
relentless
fingers
oft
have
turned
the
glass
while
flowed
the
sands
away
yet
i
give
the
dearest
treasure
hardly
gained
from
fortune
measure
could
i
be
a
boy
again
for
one
short
day
i
can
see
the
gleaming
river
the
willows
winding
blue
i
can
hear
the
schoolboys
shouting
by
the
shore
then
the
bell
begins
its
calling
echoing
the
valley
through
and
the
schoolboys
turn
toward
the
chapel
door
laggard
footsteps
scarcely
creeping
to
the
bell
low
tolling
keeping
measured
tread
as
oft
before
my
own
have
done
ah
the
longing
ceasing
never
for
a
part
in
life
endeavour
and
i
count
the
gains
that
i
have
won
i
can
hear
it
calling
calling
though
its
tongue
no
longer
swings
for
within
my
heart
its
notes
are
ringing
free
as
with
silent
step
before
me
memory
the
old
scene
brings
and
i
think
the
old
bell
voice
is
calling
me
then
i
see
the
old
loved
faces
grouped
about
their
wonted
places
as
the
boyish
voices
chant
their
song
of
praise
gone
all
thought
of
joy
or
sorrow
loss
or
gain
and
i
live
again
the
life
of
other
days
on
a
swiss
mountain
lad
the
mighty
hills
are
calling
hills
of
promise
gleaming
bright
and
the
floods
of
sunshine
falling
fill
their
deepest
vales
with
light
there
the
young
dawn
golden
fire
beckons
to
a
brighter
day
untrod
paths
of
youths
desire
heights
unconquered
far
away
steep
and
dark
and
winds
the
pathway
to
the
height
sturdy
youth
with
heart
undaunted
deems
the
toiling
short
and
light

in
royal
splendour
rose
the
house
of
prayer
its
mystic
gloom
arched
over
by
the
flight
of
soaring
vault
above
the
nave
dim
night
rich
gleamed
the
painted
windows
wondrous
fair
sweet
chimes
and
chanting
mingled
in
the
air
blue
clouds
of
incense
dimmed
the
vaulted

the
mystic
the
mystic
sits
by
the
sacred
stream
watching
the
sun
as
it
mounts
the
sky
and
life
to
him
is
a
haunting
dream
or
a
dim
weird
pageant
passing
by
sorrow
and
joy
go
on
their
way
passion
and
lust
and
love
and
hate
only
a
band
of
mummers
they
blindly
led
by
the
hand
of
fate
though
the
pageant
is
real
himself
the
dream
though
men
are
born
and
strive
and
die
yet
the
mystic
sits
by
the
sacred
stream
watching
the
sun
go
down
the
sky
a
song
of
the
homeland
i
sing
you
a
song
of
the
homeland
though
the
strains
be
of
little
worth
a
song
of
our
own
loved
homeland
of
the
noblest
land
upon
earth
where
the
tide
of
the
sea
from
oceans
three
beats
high
in
its
triple
might
where
the
winds
are
born
in
a
southern
morn
and
die
in
a
polar
night
i
sing
you
a
song
of
the
eastland
of
the
land
where
our
fathers
died
where
saxon
and
frank
their
feuds
long
dead
are
sleeping
side
by
side
where
their
sons
still
toil
on
the
soil
of
the
mighty
river
plain
where
the
censer
swings
and
the
angelus
rings
and
the
old
faith
lives
again
i
sing
you
a
song
of
the
westland
where
the
magic
cities
rise
and
the
prairies
clothed
with
their
golden
grain
stretch
under
the
azure
skies
where
the
mountains
grim
in
the
clouds
grow
dim
far
north
in
the
arctic
land
and
the
northern
light
in
its
mystic
flight
flares
over
the
golden
strand
and
i
sing
of
the
of
the
homeland
from
the
north
and
east
and
west
the
men
that
go
to
the
homeland
call
ah
god
we
have
given
our
best
but
not
in
vain
are
our
heroes
slain
if
under
the
darkened
skies
all
hand
in
hand
from
strand
to
strand
a
nation
rise
the
frozen
brook
the
winter
woods
lie
gray
and
still
beneath
the
dreary
sunless
skies
the
brook
that
rippled
down
the
hill
in
summer
hours
all
silent
lies
and
though
its
breast
by
ice
is
bound
by
bending
low
and
listening
long
i
hear
a
faint
and
sound
the
echo
of
a
summer
song
o
weary
heart
though
cold
and
drear
the
days
along
thy
pathway
seem
to
nature
breast
bend
low
thine
ear
and
listen
to
its
pulsing
stream
the
indifferent
ones
unmoved
they
sit
by
the
stream
of
life
and
its
tide
to
the
sea
goes
down
while
the
hosts
are
borne
through
the
surging
strife
to
a
hero
death
and
a
martyr
crown
they
pay
no
toll
of
their
gold
or
blood
for
them
is
a
pageant
and
naught
beside
so
they
calmly
dream
by
the
reeking
flood
while
the
sun
goes
down
in
the
crimson
tide
in
a
forest
silver
birch
and
dusky
pine
reaching
up
to
find
the
light
from
the
forest
gloomy
night
from
the
thicket
where
entwine
stunted
shrub
and
creeping
vine
from
the
damp
where
glows
and
the
poison
fungus
grows
high
you
lift
your
heads
o
trees
to
the
kisses
of
the
breeze
to
the
sapphire
sky
to
the
clouds
that
pass
you
by
to
the
sun
that
shines
on
high
from
the
dusk
of
earthly
night
strive
o
soul
to
reach
the
light
the
ships
of
memory
the
silent
ships
of
memory
creep
across
the
seas
of
long
ago
like
phantoms
on
a
tideless
deep
their
pale
prows
wander
to
and
fro
some
bear
the
dreams
of
happy
years
or
bring
a
cargo
all
of
gold
some
bear
a
freight
of
useless
tears
for
love
and
sorrow
long
untold
and
each
man
takes
the
proffered
dower
for
golden
grain
or
bitter
loss
o
happy
he
that
hath
the
power
to
take
the
gold
and
leave
the
dross
the

there
rise
the

walls
as
fair
as
when
with
arms
and
banners
gleaming
bright
the
pageantry
of
royal
pomp
and
might
passed
through
the
guarded
gates
and
went
its
way
the
blue
translucent
beams
of
morning
play
on
arch
triumphal
veiled
in
silver
light
and
here
where
blind
red
fury
reached
its
height
an
ancient
column
rises
grim
and
gray
slumbering
in
mystic
sleep
it
seems
to
be
and
dreaming
dreams
of
egypt
long
ago
unmindful
of
the
ceaseless
ebb
and
flow
about
its
feet
of
life
unresting
sea
but
the
roar
i
hear
it
murmur
low
poor
fools
they
know
not
all
is
vanity
the
parting
ways
we
trod
together
pleasant
ways
the
earth
was
fair
and
blue
the
sky
clear
were
the
nights
and
bright
the
days
and
life
was
joy
for
you
were
nigh
the
road
looks
steep
and
grim
and
shadows
fall
on
every
side
the
sun
grows
strangely
blurred
and
dim
for
in
this
place
our
paths
divide
calvary
the
women
stood
and
watched
while
thick
black
night
enclosed
the
awful
tragedy
afar
three
crosses
stood
against
a

bar
of

no
hint
of

in
all
the
height
of
that
dark

not
a

and

the

are
it
seemed
to
them
that
wrong
had
conquered
right
o

who
watch
and
wait
the
night
is
long
a
curtain
of
spun
fire
and
woven
gloom
across
the
mighty
tragedy
is
drawn
but
soon
your
ears
shall
hear
a
triumph
song
and
golden
light
shall
touch
each
sacred
tomb
and
voices
shout
at
last
the
dawn
the
dawn
the
golden
bowl
on
seeing
a
picture
of
a
boy
gazing
at
a
golden
bowl
which
among
eastern
nations
was
a
symbol
of
life
in
a
dream
he
seems
to
lie
gazing
at
the
golden
bowl
where
dim
visions
passing
by
whisper
vaguely
to
his
soul
restless
phantoms
come
and
go
crowned
with
cypress
or
with
bays
sad
or
merry
swift
or
slow
tread
they
through
the
mystic
maze
still
the
pageant
winds
along
youth
and
age
and
love
and
lust
till
at
last
the
motley
throng
fades
and
crumbles
into
dust
all
in
vain
upon
the
bowl
gaze
the
wondering
boyish
eyes
he
shall
read
its
hidden
scroll
only
when
it
shattered
lies
for
a
wondrous

shall
gleam
from
