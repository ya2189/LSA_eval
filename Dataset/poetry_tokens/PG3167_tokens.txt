preface
to
wessex
poems
of
the
miscellaneous
collection
of
verse
that
follows
only
four
pieces
have
been
published
though
many
were
written
long
ago
and
other
partly
written
in
some
few
cases
the
verses
were
turned
into
prose
and
printed
as
such
it
having
been
unanticipated
at
that
time
that
they
might
see
the
light
whenever
an
ancient
and
legitimate
word
of
the
district
for
which
there
was
no
equivalent
in
received
english
suggested
itself
as
the
most
natural
nearest
and
often
only
expression
of
a
thought
it
has
been
made
use
of
on
what
seemed
good
grounds
the
pieces
are
in
a
large
degree
dramatic
or
personative
in
conception
and
this
even
where
they
are
not
obviously
so
the
dates
attached
to
some
of
the
poems
do
not
apply
to
the
rough
sketches
given
in
illustration
which
have
been
recently
made
and
as
may
be
surmised
are
inserted
for
personal
and
local
reasons
rather
than
for
their
intrinsic

these

had
as
readily
strown
blisses
about
my
pilgrimage
as
pain
vision
i
to
in
vision
i
roamed
the
flashing
firmament
so
fierce
in
blazon
that
the
night
waxed
wan
as
though
with
an
awed
sense
of
such
ostent
and
as
i
thought
my
spirit
ranged
on
and
on
in
footless
traverse
through
ghast
heights
of
sky
to
the
last
chambers
of
the
monstrous
dome
where
stars
the
brightest
here
to
darkness
die
then
any
spot
on
our
own
earth
seemed
home
and
the
sick
grief
that
you
were
far
away
grew
pleasant
thankfulness
that
you
were
near
who
might
have
been
set
on
some
outstep
sphere
less
than
a
want
to
me
as
day
by
day
i
lived
unware
uncaring
all
that
lay
locked
in
that
universe
taciturn
and
drear
at
a
bridal
to
when
you
paced
forth
to
wait
maternity
a
dream
of
other
offspring
held
my
mind
compounded
of
us
twain
as
love
designed
rare
forms
that
corporate
now
will
never
be
should
i
too
wed
as
slave
to
decree
and
each
thus
found
apart
of
false
desire
a
stolid
line
whom
no
high
aims
will
fire
as
had
fired
ours
could
ever
have
mingled
we
and
grieved
that
lives
so
matched
should
each
mourn
the
double
waste
and
question
dare
to
the
great
dame
whence
incarnation
flows
why
those
children
never
were
what
will
she
answer
that
she
does
not
care
if
the
race
all
such
sovereign
types
unknows
postponement
in
woodland
a
mournful
word
dropt
now
and
then
from
the
bill
of
a
bird
reached
me
on
and
thus
i
heard
wearily
waiting
planned
her
a
nest
in
a
leafless
tree
but
the
passers
eyed
and
twitted
me
and
said
reckless
a
bird
is
he
cheerily
mating
i
stayed
me
till
in
lewth
of
leaves
to
throne
her
bride
but
alas
her
love
for
me
waned
and
died
wearily
waiting
had
i
been
like
some
i
see
born
to
an
evergreen
none
had
eyed
and
twitted
me
cheerily
mating
a
confession
to
a
friend
in
trouble
your
troubles
shrink
not
though
i
feel
them
less
here
far
away
than
when
i
tarried
near
i
even
smile
old
yet
smiles
they
are
not
ghastly
mockeries
mere
a
thought
too
strange
to
house
within
my
brain
haunting
its
outer
precincts
i
discern
i
will
not
show
zeal
again
to
sharing
my
it
goes
like
murky
bird
or
buccaneer
that
shapes
its
lawless
figure
on
the
main
and
each
new
impulse
tends
to
make
outflee
the
unseemly
instinct
that
had
lodgment
here
yet
comrade
old
can
bitterer
knowledge
be
than
that
though
banned
such
instinct
was
in
me
neutral
tones
we
stood
by
a
pond
that
winter
day
and
the
sun
was
white
as
though
chidden
of
god
and
a
few
leaves
lay
on
the
starving
sod
had
fallen
from
an
ash
and
were
gray
your
eyes
on
me
were
as
eyes
that
rove
over
tedious
riddles
solved
years
ago
and
some
words
played
between
us
to
and
on
which
lost
the
more
by
our
love
the
smile
on
your
mouth
was
the
deadest
thing
alive
enough
to
have
strength
to
die
and
a
grin
of
bitterness
swept
thereby
like
an
ominous
bird
since
then
keen
lessons
that
love
deceives
and
wrings
with
wrong
have
shaped
to
me
your
face
and
the
sun
and
a
tree
and
a
pond
edged
with
grayish
leaves

her
name

the
effulgent
thought

that
high
rapture
came
now

turn
the
leaf

immortal
light
illumes
the
lay
but
from
the
letters
of
her
name

radiance
has
died
away

dilemma

church
the
two
were
silent
in
a
sunless
church
whose
mildewed
walls
uneven
and
wasted
carvings
passed
antique
research
and
nothing
broke

dull
monotones

against
a
wormy
so
wan
and
worn
that

could
scarcely
stand

die

me

hard

hand

would
have
given
a
world
to
breathe
truly
so
much

life
seemed
handing
on
her
mind
and
hence
she
lied
her
heart
persuaded
throughly
worth
her
soul
to
be
a
moment
kind
but
the
sad
need
thereof

nearing
death
so
mocked
humanity
that
she
shamed
to
prize
a
world

nature

dilemmas
could
devise

i
waste
watches
framing
words
to
fetter
some
spirit
to
mine
own
in
clasp
and
kiss
out
of
the
night
there
looms
a
sense
better
to
fail
obtaining
whom
one
fails
to
miss
for
winning
love
we
win
the
risk
of
losing
and
losing
love
is
as
life
were
riven
it
cuts
like
contumely
and
keen
to
cede
what
was
superfluously
given
let
me
then
feel
no
more
the
fateful
thrilling
that
devastates
the
frame
the
hot
ado
of
fevered
hopes
the
chilling
that
agonizes
disappointed
aim
so
may
i
live
no
junctive
law
fulfilling
and
my
table
bear
no
name

walking

i
when
you
shall
see
me
in
the
toils
of
time
my
lauded
beauties
carried
off
from
me
my
eyes
no
longer
stars
as
in
their
prime
my
name
forgot
of
maiden
fair
and
free
when
in
your
being
heart
concedes
to
mind
and
judgment
though
you
scarce
its
process
know
recalls
the
excellencies
i
once
enshrined
and
you
are
irked
that
they
have
withered
so
remembering
that
with
me
lies
not
the
blame
that
sportsman
time
but
rears
his
brood
to
kill
knowing
me
in
my
soul
the
very
one
who
would
die
to
spare
you
touch
of
ill
will
you
not
grant
to
old
claim
the
hand
of
friendship
down
sunless
hill
she
to
him
ii
perhaps
long
hence
when
i
have
passed
away
some
feature
accent
thought
like
mine
will
carry
you
back
to
what
i
used
to
say
and
bring
some
memory
of
your
decline
then
you
may
pause
awhile
and
think
jade
and
yield
a
sigh
to
ample
due
not
as
the
tittle
of
a
debt
unpaid
to
one
who
could
resign
her
all
to
and
thus
reflecting
you
will
never
see
that
your
thin
thought
in
two
small
words
conveyed
was
no
such
fleeting
to
me
but
the
whole
life
wherein
my
part
was
played
and
you
amid
its
fitful
masquerade
a
i
in
yours
but
seem
to
be
she
to
him
iii
i
will
be
faithful
to
thee
aye
i
will
and
death
shall
choose
me
with
a
wondering
eye
that
he
did
not
discern
and
domicile
one
his
by
right
ever
since
that
last
i
have
no
care
for
friends
or
kin
or
prime
of
manhood
who
deal
gently
with
me
here
amid
the
happy
people
of
my
time
who
work
their
fulfilment
i
appear
numb
as
a
vane
that
cankers
on
its
point
true
to
the
wind
that
kissed
ere
canker
came
despised
by
souls
of
now
who
would
disjoint
the
mind
from
memory
and
make
life
all
aim
my
old
dexterities
of
hue
quite
gone
and
nothing
left
for
love
to
look
upon
she
to
him
iv
this
love
puts
all
humanity
from
me
i
can
but
maledict
her
pray
her
dead
for
giving
love
and
getting
love
of
feeding
a
heart
that
else
mine
own
had
fed
how
much
i
love
i
know
not
life
not
known
save
as
some
unit
i
would
add
love
by
but
this
i
know
my
being
is
but
thine
fused
from
its
separateness
by
ecstasy
and
thus
i
grasp
thy
amplitudes
of
her
ungrasped
though
helped
by
eyes
canst
thou
then
hate
me
as
an
envier
who
see
unrecked
what
i
so
dearly
prize
believe
me
lost
one
love
is
lovelier

more

flown
nestlings
play

weathered
stone

away

formal

the
bough

no
merchants

no
man

where
she
dwells

fabric

descry

times

i
no

legend
tells

i

to
what
i
was
ere

met
such
can
not
be
but
because
some
forget
let
me
feign
it
would
notice
that
where
she
i
know
by
rote
is
spread
a
strange
and
withering
change
like
a
drying
of
the
wells
where
she

feel
i
might
have
loved
as
otherwhere
nor
mine
have
missed
my
life
through
had
i
never
wandered

her
is
a
smart

the
thought
that
she
is
nought

as
i
beyond

dells

droops

though
at

and
your
sunny
years
with
a
gracious

brought
you
a

as
she
danced
in
her
muslin
bowed
with
blue
round
a

never

i
watched
her
this

too
as
it

the

now
he
again
began
just
such
an
age
as
one
i
knew
when

stormed
san

a

so
about

the

wronged
in

you
may
prate
of
your
prowess
in
lusty
times
but
as
years
gnaw
inward
you
blink
your
bays
and
see
too
well
your
crimes
stormed
it
at
night
by
the
of
burning
towers
and
the
boom
topped
the
breach
but
had
failed
to
stay
for
our
files
were
misled
by
the
baffling
gloom
and
we
said
storm
by
day

of

out
of
the

with
features
set
on
that
hot
still
morning
in
measured
pace
our

climbed
climbed
higher
yet
past
the
scarp
up
the
and
along
the

battened
hornwork

and
as
they
mount
expire
amid
curses

hours
did
we
storm
five
hours
as
death
cooled
those
hot
blood
pricked
on
till
our
cause
was
helped
by
a
woe
within
they
swayed
from
the
summit
leapt
upon
and
madly
we
entered
in
end
for
plunder
rain
and
thunder
that
burst
with
the
lull
of
our
cannonade
we
vamped
the
streets
in
the
stifling
our
hunger
unsoothed
our
thirst
and
ransacked
the
buildings
there
the
stony
steps
of
the
white
we
rolled
rich
puncheons
of
spanish
grape
till
at
length
with
the
fire
of
the
wine
alight
i
saw
at
a
doorway
a
fair
fresh
a
woman
a
sylph
or
sprite
she
fled
and
with
heated
head
i
pursued
to
the
chamber
she
called
her
own
might
is
right
no
qualms
deter
and
having
her
helpless
and
alone
i
wreaked
my
will
on
her
raised
her
beseeching
eyes
to
me
and
i
heard
the
words
of
prayer
she
sent
in
her
own
soft
language
seemingly
i
copied
those
eyes
for
my
punishment
in
begetting
the
girl
you
see
i
stand
with
a
brand
like
when
he
wandered
from
ken
i
served
through
the
war
that
made
europe
free
i
wived
me
in
but
hid
from
men
i
bear
that
mark
on
me
i
nightly
stray
on
the
ivel
way
as
though
at
home
there
were
spectres
rife
i
delight
me
not
in
my
proud
career
and
coals
of

a

my

unshent
news
concerning

said

started
and
we
paced
the

along
till
i
replied
it
has
come
to
this
do
it
but
alone
i
can
be
three
hours
past
curfew
when
the
mild
hiss
reigned
sole
undulled
by
whirr
of
merchandize
from
to
where
the
gibbet
is
i
crossed
my
pleasaunce
hard
by
rise
and
stood
beneath
the
wall
eleven
strokes
went
and
to
the
door
they
came
contrariwise
and
met
in
clasp
so
close
i
had
but
bent
my
lifted
blade
upon
them
to
have
let
their
two
souls
loose
upon
the
firmament
but
something
held
my
arm
moment
yet
as
ere
you
wantons
die
i
said
and
then
they
saw
me
swift
her
gaze
was
set
with
eye
and
cry
of
love
illimited
upon
her
never
upon
me
had
she
thrown
look
of
love
so
at
once
she
flung
her
faint
form
shieldingly
on
his
against
the
vengeance
of
my
vows
the
which
her
shape
shielded
he
blanked
by
such
love
i
stood
as
in
a
drowse
and
the
slow
moon
edged
from
the
upland
nigh
my
sad
thoughts
moving
thuswise
may
house
and
i
may
husband
her
yet
what
am
i
but
licensed
tyrant
to
this
bonded
pair
says
charity
do
as
ye
would
be
done
hurling
my
iron
to
the
bushes
there
i
bade
them
stay
and
as
if
brain
and
breast
were
passive
they
walked
with
me
to
the
stair
inside
the
house
none
watched
and
on
we
prest
before
a
mirror
in
whose
gleam
i
read
her
beauty
his
mine
own
mien
unblest
till
at
her
room
i
turned
i
said
you
the
wherewithal
for
this

nothing

and
next
i
saw
piled
her
raiment
rare
within
the
and
her
household
purse
her
jewels
and
least
lace
of
personal
wear
and
stood
in
homespun
now
grown
wholly
hers
i
handed
her
the
gold
her
jewels
all
and
him
the
choicest
of
her
robes

take
you
to
the
doorway
in

and
then
adieu
i
to
them
they
did
so
and
she
recall
and
as
i
paused
beneath
the
arch
i
saw
their
moonlit
as
in
descend
the
slope
and
vanish
on
the
haw
some
will
say
i
thought
who
is
wise
save
god
alone
to
weigh
my
reasons
why
thou

that
was

how
the

night
glowed
still

ay
as

my

saw
these

whenever

in

was
waged
anew
by

napoleon
who
for
years
had
strewn
bones
all
europe
through
three
nights
ere
this
with
columned
corps
crossed
the
sambre
at
charleroi
to
move
on
brussels
where
the
english

dallied
in

yestertide
heard
the

through

suppressed
the

though
unbroke
stood
cornered

constrained
and
at
next
grouchy
slowly
passed
with
thirty
thousand
men
we
hoped
thenceforth
no
army
small
or
vast
would
trouble
us
again
my
hut
lay
deeply
in
a
vale
recessed
and
never
a
soul
seemed
nigh
when
reassured
at
length
we
went
to
my
children
wife
and
i
but
what
was
this
that
broke
our
humble
ease
what
noise
above
the
rain
above
the
dripping
of
the
poplar
trees
that
smote
along
the
pane
call
of
mastery
bidding
me
arise
compelled
me
to
the
door
at
which
a
horseman
stood
in
martial
from
every
pore
had
i
seen
grouchy
yes
which
track
took
he
could
i
lead
thither
on
fulfilment
would
ensure
gold

i
joined
him
in

pausing
sought
to
estimate
his

had
made
for

yet
on

i
did
not

that
way

i
begin

lead
him
treacherously
by

as
we

pierced
the
humid

and
eastward
faced
i
with
him
though
i
knew
never
marched
grouchy
there
near
ottignies
we
passed
across
the
dyle
left
far
aside
and
thence
direct
toward

and
noville
through

till
he
cried

no

scowled
on

pranced
me

me

his
sword

we
skirt

from

boomed

from

cried

he
turned
to

me
i
sprang
and
drew
the

from

and
his

discerning

in

and
after

summons
and
forth
i
went
by
the
way
of
the
western
wall
so
drear
on
that
winter
night
and
sought
a
the
home
by
fate
of
one
i
had
long
held
dear
and
there
as
i
paused
by
her
tenement
and
the
trees
shed
on
me
their
rime
and
hoar
i
thought
of
the
man
who
had
left
her
him
who
made
her
his
own
when
i
loved
her
long
before
the
rooms
within
had
the
piteous
shine
that
wear
when
aught
amiss
from
the
stairway
floated
the
rise
and
fall
of
an
call
whose
birth
had
brought
her
to
this
her
life
was
the
price
she
would
pay
for
that
for
a
child
by
the
man
she
did
not
love
let
that
rest
for
ever
i
said
and
bent
my
tread
to
the
chamber
up
above
she
took
my
hand
in
her
thin
white
own
and
smiled
her
nigh
too
and
made
them
a
sign
to
leave
us
there
then
faltered
ere
she
could
bring
herself
to
speak
to
see
you
before
i
condone
such
a
natural
thing
now
my
not
when
death
is
so
near
it
hustles
hence
all
passioned
sense
between
woman
and
man
as
such
husband
is
absent
as
heretofore
the
city
detains
him
but
in
truth
he
has
not
been
kind
i
will
speak
no
blame
child
is
lame
o
i
pray
she
may
reach
his
ruth
past
can
say
no
maybe
if
wedded
now
repine
but
i
treated
you
ill
i
was
punished
farewell
shall
i
tell
would
the
child
were
yours
and
mine
a
wife
i
was
true
but
such
my
unease
that
could
i
insert
a
deed
back
in
time
make
her
yours
to
secure
your
care
and
the
scandal
bear
and
the
penalty
for
the
crime
i
had
left
and
the
swinging
trees
rang
above
me
as
lauding
her
candid
say
another
was
i
her
words
were
enough
came
smooth
came
rough
i
felt
i
could
live
my
day
next
night
she
died
and
her
obsequies
in
the
field
of
tombs
by
the
via
renowned
had
her
heed
his
tendance
spent
i
often
went
and
pondered
by
her
mound
all
that
year
and
the
next
year
whiled
and
i
still
went
thitherward
in
the
gloam
but
the
town
forgot
her
and
her
nook
and
her
husband
took
another
love
to
his
home
and
the
rumour
flew
that
the
lame
lone
child
whom
she
wished
for
its
safety
child
of
mine
was
treated
ill
when
offspring
came
of
the
dame
and
marked
a
more
vigorous
line
picture
sketch
of
cemetery
a
smarter
grief
within
me
wrought
than
even
at
loss
of
her
so
dear
dead
the
being
whose
soul
my
soul
suffused
her
child
i
helpless
to
interfere
one
eve
as
i
stood
at
my
spot
of
thought
in
the
garth
brooding
thus
her
wrong
her
husband
neared
and
to
shun
his
view
by
her
hallowed
mew
i
went
from
the
tombs
among
to
the
cirque
of
the
gladiators
which
that
haggard
mark
of
imperial
rome
whose
pagan
echoes
mock
the
chime
of
our
christian
time
it
was
void
and
i
inward
clomb
scarce
night
the
gold
touch
displaced
from
the
vast
rotund
and
the
neighbouring
dead
when
her
husband
followed
bowed
with
lip
upcast
then
halting
sullenly
said
is
noised
that
you
visit
my
first
tomb
now
i
gave
her
an
honoured
name
to
bear
while
living
when
dead
so
claim
to
ask
by
what
right
you
task
my
patience
by
vigiling
there
decency
even
in
death
i
assume
preserve
it
sir
and
keep
away
for
the
mother
of
my
you
show
mind
undue
nothing
more
to
a
desperate
stroke
discerned
i
god
pardon
lie
she
had
sighed
that
she
wished
lest
the
child
should
pine
of
slights
mine
so
i
said
the
father
i
you
thought
it
yours
is
the
way
of
men
but
i
won
her
troth
long
ere
your
day
you
learnt
how
in
dying
she
summoned
me
in
fealty
nothing
more
to
say
that
if
hand
me
my
little
maid
take
her
and
rear
her
and
spare
you
toil
think
it
more
than
a
friendly
act
none
can
a
lonely
man
while
a
large
pot
to
boil
not
and
put
it
to
ball
or
night
meet
you
here
but
think
of
it
and
in
season
fit
let
me
hear
from
you
i
went
away
hoping
but
nought
i
heard
of
my
stroke
for
the
child
till
there
greeted
me
a
little
voice
that
one
day
came
to
my
and
babbled
innocently
father
not
my
own
sends
word
to
stay
here
sir
where
i
belong
next
a
writing
came
the
child
was
the
fruit
of
your
lawless
suit
pray
take
her
to
right
a
and
i
did
and
i
gave
the
child
my
love
and
the
child
loved
me
and
estranged
us
none
but
compunctions
loomed
for
harmed
the
dead
by
what
said
for
the
good
of
the
living
one
though
god
wot
i
am
sinner
enough
and
unworthy
the

who
drew
me

perhaps
this
wrong
for

good
she
forgives

came
a
gentle
youth
from
inland
leazes
lone
his
love
was
fresh
as
by
parrett
yeo
or
tone
and
duly
he
entreated
her
to
be
his
tender
minister
and
call
him
aye
her
own
fair
life
had
hardly
been
a
life
of
modesty
at

experience
keen
of
many
loves
had
she
from
scarcely
sixteen
years
above
among
them
sundry
troopers
of
the
cavalry
but
each
with
charger
sword
and
gun
had
bluffed

jenny
prized
her
gentle

for
all
the

he
gave

vowed
to
be
if

his
honest
wife
in

from

wedded
they
were

jenny
kept
her
pure

just
till
even
malice
found
no
sin
or

of
ill
to
be
in
one
who
walked
so
decently
the
duteous
round
two
sons
were
born
and
bloomed
to
men
and
roamed
and
were
as
not
alone
was
jenny
left
again
as
ere
her
mind
had
sought
a
solace
in
domestic
joys
and
ere
the
vanished
pair
of
boys
were
sent
to
sun
her
cot
she
numbered
near
on
sixty
years
and
passed
as
elderly
when
in

day
discovered

turned

thoughts
she
said

now

yet
those

me
through

forms
move
me
anew

as
she
lay
beside
her
spouse
till
springtide
blood
seemed
scouring
through
her
like
a
flood
that
whisked
the
years
away
she
rose
and
rayed
and
decked
her
head
where
the
bleached
hairs
ran
thin
upon
her
cap
two
bows
of
red
she
fixed
with
hasty
pin
unheard
descending
to
the

she
trod
the

like

a

arrowed
through
her
heart
in
shoots
of
agony
their
footsteps
died
as
she
leant
there
lit
by
the
morning
star
hanging
above
the
moorland
where

are
and
as
from

no

stirred
near
or

though
inner
mischief
worked

reached
her
side
where
as
he
had
lain
beneath
the
patchwork
pied

yestereve
forthward
crept

as
unwitting
still
he
slept

did
in

a
tear
sprang
as
she
turned
and
viewed
his
features
free
from
guile
she
kissed
him
long
as
when
just
wooed
she
chose
his
domicile
she
felt
she
could
have
given
her
life
to
be
the
wife
that
she
had

her
husband
rose
and
struck
the
steel
and
stone
he
glanced
at
jenny
whose
repose
seemed
deeper
than
his
own
with
dumb
dismay
on
closer
sight
he
gathered
sense
that
in
the
night
or
morn
her
soul
had
flown
when
told
that
some

in

had
squandered
green
years
and
maturer
in
bowing
the
knee
to
baals
illusive

specious
till
chance
had
there
voiced
me
that
one
i
loved
vainly
in

had
ceased

to
be
the
passion
the
planets
had
scowled
on
and
change
had
let

relifted
to

i
mounted

in

with
acheful
remembrance
and
made
for
the
ancient
west
highway
to
far
passing
heaths
and
the
house

long
sieging
i
neared
the
thin
steeple
that
tops
the
fair
fane
of
olden
episcopal
see
and
changing
anew
my
onbearer
i
traversed
the
downland
whereon
the
bleak
of
chieftains
bulge
barren
of
tree
and
still
sadly
onward
i
followed
that
highway
the
icen
which
trails
its
pale
riband
down
wessex
lynchet
and
lea
along
through
the
forum
where
legions
had
wayfared
and
where
the
slow
river
upglasses
its
green
canopy
and
by
weatherbury

and
thencefrom
through
casterbridge
held
i
still
on
to
entomb
her

vision
saw
stretched
pallidly
no

blew
the
to
me
so
but
only
the
creak

me
from
southward
and
north
the

passed

exe
scents

spent
in
the

pausing
i
learnt
not
my

whom
mother

had
just
murmured
a
last
lullaby

dwells
the
kinswoman
my
friend
of
aforetime

repress

and
new
ecstasy

she

ten

hence
beside
the
great
the
famed
spouse
was
her
option
wedlock
and
worse
things
a
lapse
for
a
lady
of
her
pedigree
i
shuddered
said
nothing
and
wandered
to
shades
of
green
laurel
too
ghastly
had
grown
those
first
tidings
so
brightsome
of
blee
for
on
my
ride
hither
halted
awhile
at
the
lions
and
whose
name
had
once
opened
my
heart
as
a
looked
on
unknowing
and
witnessed
her
jests
with
the
tapsters
her
face
her
thick
accents
in
naming
her
fee
god
why
this
seeming
derision
i
cried
in
my
anguish
once
loved
o
fair
that
it
thee
and
at
peace
lost
but
sainted
were
grief
i
could
compass
for
poor
dependent
a
cruel
decree
i
backed
on
the
highway
but
passed
not
the
hostel
within
there
too
mocking
to
was
repartee
uptracking
where
legions
had
wayfared
by
cromlechs
unstoried
and
lynchets
and
sepultured
chieftains
in
a
feeling
stirred
in
me
and
strengthened
that
was
not
my
love
but
she
of
the
garth
who
lay
rapt
in
her
long
reverie
and
thence
till
i
persuade
me
that
this
was
the
true
one
that
death
stole
intact
her
young
dearness
and
innocency
illuded
they
call
me
i
may
be
better
to
dream
than
to
own
the
debasement
of
sweet
cicely
moreover
i
rate
it
unseemly
to
hold
that
kind
heaven
could
work
such
her
ruin
and
my
misery
so
lest
i
disturb
my
choice
vision
i
shun
the
west
highway
even
now
when
the
knaps
ring
with
rhythms
from
blackbird
and
bee
and
feel
that
with
slumber
she
rests
in
the
her
spirit
unsoiled
as
in
when
lovers
were
we
picture

of

with

her
immortality
upon
a
noon
i
pilgrimed
through
a
pasture
mile
by
mile
unto
the
place
where
i
last
saw
my
dead
living
smile
and
sorrowing
i
lay
me
down
upon
the
heated
sod
it
seemed
as
if
my
body
pressed
the
very
ground
she
trod
i
lay
and
thought
and
in
a
trance
she
came
and
stood
me
the
same
even
to
the
marvellous
ray
that
used
to
light
her
eye
draw
me
and
i
come
to
you
my
faithful
one
she
said
in
voice
that
had
the
moving
tone
it
bore
ere
breath
had
fled
she
said
seven
years
since
i
died
few
now
remember
me
my
husband
clasps
another
bride
my
love
has
she
brethren
sisters
and
my
friends
care
not
to
meet
my
sprite
who
prized
me
most
i
did
not
know
till
i
passed
down
from
i
said
days
are
lonely
here
i
need
thy
smile
alway
use
this
night
my
ball
or
blade
and
join
thee
ere
the
a
tremor
stirred
her
tender
lips
which
parted
to
dissuade
can
not
be
o
friend
she
cried
i
am
but
a
shade
shade
but
in
its
mindful
ones
has
immortality
by
living
me
you
keep
alive
by
dying
you
slay
me
you
resides
my
single
power
of
sweet
continuance
here
on
your
fidelity
i
count
through
many
a
coming
started
through
me
at
her
plight
so
suddenly
confessed
dismissing
late
distaste
for
life
i
craved
its
bleak
unrest
will
not
die
my
one
of
all
to
lengthen
out
thy
days
guard
me
from
minutest
harms
that
may
invest
my
ways
she
smiled
and
went
since
then
she
comes
oft
when
her
climbs
or
at
the
ingresses
or
anniversary
times
but
grows
my
grief
when
i
surcease
through
whom
alone
lives
she
ceases
my
love
her
words
her
ways
never
again
to
be
the
i
longed
to
love
a
beech
and
be
as
high
as
he
i
stretched
an
arm
within
his
reach
and
signalled
unity
but
with
his
drip
he
forced
a
breach
and
tried
to
poison
me
i
gave
the
grasp
of
partnership
to
one
of
other
a
plane
he
barked
him
strip
by
strip
from
upper
bough
to
base
and
me
therewith
for
gone
my
grip
my
arms
could
not
enlace
in
new
affection
next
i
strove
to
coll
an
ash
i
saw
and
he
in
trust
received
my
love
till
with
my
soft
green
claw
i
cramped
and
bound
him
as
i
wove
such
was
my
love
by
this
i
gained
his
strength
and
height
without
his
rivalry
but
in
my
triumph
i
lost
sight
of
afterhaps
soon
he
being
flagged
snapped
fell
outright
and
in
his
fall
felled
me
a
meeting
with
despair
as
evening
shaped
i
found
me
on
a
moor
which
sight
could
scarce
sustain
the
black
lean
land
of
featureless
contour
was
like
a
tract
in
pain
scene
like
my
own
life
i
said
one
where
many
glooms
abide
toned
by
its
fortune
to
a
deadly
lightless
on
every
side
i
glanced
aloft
and
halted
to
see
the
contrast
there
the
clouds
gleamed
glory
and
i
thought
solace
everywhere
then
bitter
as
i
stood
i
dealt
me
silently
as
one
good
in
graceless
mutiny
against
the
wheel
a
form
rose
strange
of
mould
that
he
was
hideous
hopeless
i
could
feel
rather
than
could
behold
a
dead
spot
where
even
the
light
lies
spent
to
darkness
croaked
the
thing
if
you
look
aloft
said
i
intent
on
my
new
reasoning
await
awhile
he
cried
look
now
aloft
and
see
i
looked
there
too
sat
night
radiant
show
had
gone
then
chuckled
he
unknowing
when
soul
in
soul
reflected
we
breathed
an
æthered
air
when
we
neglected
all
things
elsewhere
and
left
the
friendly
friendless
to
keep
our
love
aglow
we
deemed
it
endless
did
not
know
when
by
mad
passion
goaded
we
planned
to
hie
away
but
unforeboded
the
gray
so
heavily
that
none
could
forthward
go
our
lives
seemed
shattered
did
not
know
when
i
found
you
helpless
lying
and
you
waived
my
deep
misprise
and
swore
me
dying
in
to
wing
to
me
when
grieving
and
touch
away
my
woe
we
kissed

though
your

outreckoning
you
hold
you
dead

that
which
chilled

breath
of
afternoon

palsied
unto

zeal
foretold

deemed

thy

is
dead
and
soon

their

who
bear
his

to
his
so
unwontedly
sad
was
the
merry
that
face
which
had
long
that
she
gazed
and
gazed
and
then
could
trace
the
truth
there
and
she
believed
she
laid
a
hand
on

and
scanned
far
and
stood
and
you
heard
the
sedge
and
the
rippling
froom

all
go
up

she
disappeared
and
the
joker
stood
depressed
by
his
doom
and
amazed
that
a
wife
struck
to
widowhood
thought
first
of
her
unkempt
room
but
a
fortnight
thence
she
could
take
no
food
and
she
pined
in
a
slow
decay
while
kit
soon
lost
his
mournful
mood
and
laughed
in
his
ancient
way
in
a
eweleaze
near
weatherbury
the
years
have
gathered
grayly
since
i
danced
upon
this
leaze
with
one
who
kindled
gaily
fitful
ecstasies
but
despite
the
term
as
teacher
i
remain
what
i
was
then
in
each
essential
feature
of
the
fantasies
of
men
yet
i
note
the
little
chisel
of
time
defacing
ghast
and
grizzel
the
blazon
of
my
prime
when
at
night
he
thinks
me
sleeping
i
feel
him
boring
sly
within
my
bones
and
heaping
quaintest
pains
for
still
go
the
world
with
beauty
i
would
laugh
with
her
and
sing
i
would
shun
divinest
duty
to
resume
her
worshipping
but
scorn
my
brave
endeavour
she
would
not
balm
the
breeze
by
murmuring
for
ever
as
she
did
upon
this
leaze
picture
sketch
of
pair
of
glasses
on
sketch
of
landscape
additions
the
fire
at
tranter
they
had
long
met
true
love
and
and
at
junketings
maypoles
and
flings
but
she
bode
a
thirtover
uncle
and
he
swore
by
noon
and
by
night
that
her
goodman
should
be
naibour
gaffer
oft
weak
at
the
knee
from
taking
sommat
more

than

with

in

without

found
himself
near
the
house
of
the
tranter
and
now
of
his
dear
where
the

the
bride
sought
her
so
calm
and
so
pale
that
a
northern
had
thought
her
resigned
but
to
eyes
that
had
seen
her
in
of
weal
like
the
white
cloud

look
of
havoc
behind

laitered

with
a
rushing
of

than

soul
like

en
tim
had
a
great
soul
when
his
feelings
were
wrung
for
dear
barbree
he
cried
and
his
warm
about
her
he
flung
made
a
back
horsed
her
up
till
behind
him
she
clung
like
a
chiel
on
a
gipsy
her
figure
uphung
by
the
sleeves
that
around
her
he
tied
over
piggeries
and
mixens
and
apples
and
hay
they
lumpered
straight
into
the
night
and
finding
bylong
where
a
lay
at
dawn
reached
house
seen
on
their
way
by
a
naibour
or
two
who
were
up
the
day
but
they
gathered
no
clue
to
the
sight
then
tender
tim
tankens
he
searched
here
and
there
for
some
garment
to
clothe
her
fair
skin
but
though
he
had
breeches
and
waistcoats
to
spare
he
had
nothing
quite
seemly
for
barbree
to
wear
who
half
shrammed
to
death
stood
and
cried
on
a
chair
at
the
caddle
she
found
herself
in
there
was
one
thing
to
do
and
that
one
thing
he
did
he
lent
her
some
clouts
of
his
own
and
she
took
perforce
and
while
in
she
slid
tim
turned
to
the
winder
as
modesty
bid
thinking
that
the
picter
my
duty
keeps
hid
to
the
sight
my
eyes
mid
be
shown
in
the
tallet
he
stowed
her
there
huddied
she
lay
shortening
sleeves
legs
and
tails
to
her
limbs
but
most
the
time
in
a
mortal
bad
way
well
knowing
that
be
the
divel
to
pay
if
found
that
instead
the
prey
she
was

in

on

the
tranter
said
they
sifted
the
dust
of
his
perished
and
all
they
could
find
was
a
bone
then
the
uncle
cried
pray
have
mercy
on
me
and
in
terror
began
to
repent
but
before
complete
and
till
sure
she
was
free
barbree
drew
up
her
tight
turned
her
tim
bringing
up
breakfast
and
dinner
and
till
the
news
of
her
hiding
got
vent
then
followed
the
rout
shout
and
flare
of
a
through
the
naibourhood
ere
folk
had
proof
wold
decay
whereupon
decent
people
all
stood
in
a
stare
saying
tim
and
his

risk
it
and

he
took
her
to

corpse
adown
the

for
you

the
two
men
there
were
two
youths
of
equal
age
wit
station
strength
and
parentage
they
studied
at
the
selfsame
schools
and
shaped
their
thoughts
by
common
rules
one
pondered
on
the
life
of
man
his
hopes
his
ending
and
began
to
rate
the
sordid
war
as
something
scarce
worth
living
for
brace
to
higher
aims
said
he
further
truth
and
purity
thereby
to
mend
the
mortal
lot
and
sweeten
sorrow
thrive
i
not
their
hearts
my
kind
will
give
enough
that
i
may
lowly
live
and
house
my
love
in
some
dim
dell
for
pleasing
them
and
theirs
so
idly
attired
with
features
wan
in
secret
swift
he
laboured
on
such
press
of
power
had
brought
much
gold
applied
to
things
of
meaner
mould
sometimes
he
wished
his
aims
had
been
to
gather
gains
like
other
men
then
thanked
his
god
traced
his
track
too
far
for
wish
to
drag
him
back
he
lookèd
from
his
loft
one
day
to
where
his
slighted
garden
lay
nettles
and
hemlock
hid
each
lawn
and
every
flower
was
starved
and
gone
he
fainted
in
his
heart
whereon
he
rose
and
sought
his
plighted
one
resolved
to
loose
her
bond
withal
lest
she
should
perish
in
his
fall
he
met
her
with
a
careless
air
as
though
ceased
to
find
her
fair
and
said
love
is
dust
to
me
i
can
not
kiss
i
tire
of
thee
that
she
might
scorn
him
was
he
fain
to
put
her
sooner
out
of
pain
for
incensed
love
breathes
quick
and
dies
when
famished
love
lies
once
done
his
soul
was
so
betossed
it
found
no
more
the
force
it
lost
hope
was
his
only
drink
and
food
and
hope
extinct
decay
ensued
and
living
long
so
closely
penned
he
had
not
kept
a
single
friend
he
dwindled
thin
as
phantoms
be
and
drooped
to
death
in
poverty
meantime
his
schoolmate
had
gone
out
to
join
the
rout
he
liked
the
winnings
of
the
mart
but
wearied
of
the
working
part
he
turned
to
seek
a
privy
lair
neglecting
note
of
garb
and
hair
and
day
by
day
reclined
and
thought
how
he
might
live
by
doing
nought
plan
a
valued
scheme
he
said
to
some
lend
me
of
your
bread
and
when
the
vast
result
looms
nigh
in
profit
you
shall
stand
as
yet
they
took
counsel
to
restrain
their
kindness
till
they
saw
the
gain
and
since
his
substance
now
had
run
he
rose
to
do
what
might
be
done
he
went
unto
his
love
by
night
and
said
love
i
faint
in
fight
deserving
as
thou
dost
a
crown
my
cares
shall
never
drag
thee
he
had
descried
a
maid
whose
line
would
hand
her
on
much
corn
and
wine
and
held
her
far
in
worth
above
one
who
could
only
pray
and
love
but
this
fair
read
him
whence
he
failed
to
do
the
deed
so
blithely
hailed
he
saw
his
projects
wholly
marred
and
gloom
and
want
oppressed
him
hard
till
living
to
so
mean
an
end
whereby
lost
his
every
friend
he
perished
in
a
pauper
sty

mate

dying
pauper
