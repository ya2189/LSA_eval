a
prelude
francis
sherman
a
prelude
watching
the
tremulous
flicker
of
the
green
against
the
open
quiet
of
the
sky
i
hear
my
ancient
convene
in
the
great
wood
behind
me
where
i
lie
they
may
not
see
me
for
the
grasses
grow
as
though
no
foot
save
had
wandered
by
yet
i
who
am
surely
know
as
i
have
waited
them
they
yearn
for
me
to
lead
them
whither
they
are
fain
to
go
weary
as
i
are
they
o
time
of
thee
yea
we
who
once
were
glad
only
of
spring
gather
about
thy
wall
and
would
be
free
with
wounded
feet
we
cease
from
wandering
and
with
vain
hands
beat
idly
at
thy
gate
and
thou
hast
no
thought
of
opening
and
from
thy
peace
are
we
still
separate
yet
comrades
though
ye
come
together
there
and
search
across
the
shadows
for
my
face
until
the
pines
murmur
of
your
despair
i
think
i
shall
not
tell
my
for
ye
know
not
the
path
ye
would
pursue
and
it
is
late
our
footsteps
to
retrace
too
weak
am
i
and
now
not
one
of
so
weary
are
ye
of
each
ancient
retaineth
strength
enough
to
seek
a
new
and
ye
are
not
night
from
day
crying
at
noontime
let
us
see
the
sun
and
with
the
even
o
for
rest
we
pray
o
blind
and
fearful
shall
i
who
have
won
at
last
this
little
portion
of
content
yield
all
to
be
with
you
again
undone
because
ye
languish
in
your
prisonment
must
i
now
hearken
to
your
bitter
cry
must
i
forego
as
ye
long
since
forewent
my
vision
of
the
open
sky
nay
earth
hath
much
ungiven
she
yet
may
give
and
though
your
laboring
souls
would
die
from
earth
my
soul
gaineth
the
strength
to
live
o
covering
grasses
o
unchanging
trees
is
it
not
good
to
feel
the
odorous
wind
come
down
upon
you
with
such
harmonies
only
the
giant
hills
can
ever
find
o
little
leaves
are
ye
not
glad
to
be
is
not
the
sunlight
fair
the
shadow
kind
that
falls
at
over
you
and
me
o
gleam
of
birches
lost
among
the
firs
let
your
high
treble
chime
in
silverly
across
the
wind
that
stirs
a
muffled
from
the
pines
earth
knows
that
not
one
note
of
hers
is
minor
for
behold
the
loud
sun
shines
till
the
young
maples
are
no
longer
gray
and
stronger
grow
their
faint
uncertain
lines
each
violet
takes
a
deeper
blue
and
purpler
swell
the
cones
hung
overhead
until
the
sound
of
their
far
feet
who
about
the
wood
fades
from
me
and
instead
i
hear
a
robin
as
one
that
calls
unto
his
mate
but
as
one
sings
a
welcome
to
the
sun
not
among
men
or
near
things
in
the
old
years
found
i
this
present
ease
though
i
have
known
the
fellowship
of
kings
and
tarried
long
in
splendid
palaces
the
worship
of
vast
peoples
has
been
mine
the
homage
of
uncounted
pageantries
and
fruits
of
field
and
vine
have
humble
folk
been
proud
to
bring
to
me
and
woven
cloths
of
wonderful
design
have
lain
untouched
in
far
lands
till
the
rich
traffickers
beheld
my
sails
long
caravans
have
toiled
on
harassed
yet
watchful
of
their
costly
across
wide
sandy
places
glad
to
bear
strange
oils
and
perfumes
strained
in
indian
vales
great
gleaming
rubies
torn
from
some
hair
yellow
coin
and
golded
dust
deeming
that
i
would
find
their
offerings
fair
fairness
quick
to
fade
ashes
and
rust
and
food
for
moths
o
things
once
think
when
one
is
thrust
far
down
in
the
where
the
worm
clings
close
to
the
among
the
dead
not
one
awakes
to
ask
what
gift
she
brings
the
color
of
her
eyes
her
hair
outspread
in
the
moist
wind
that
stifles
ere
it
blows
falls
on
unwatching
eyes
and
no
man
knows
the
gracious
odors
that
her
garments
shed
and
she
unwearied
yet
and
not
grown
wise
follows
a
little
while
her
devious
way
across
the
twilight
where
no
voice
replies
when
her
voice
calls
bravely
and
where
is
even
as
yesterday
and
all
days
were
great
houses
loom
up
swiftly
out
of
the
gray
knocking
at
last
the
gradual
echoes
stir
the
hangings
of
unhaunted
passages
until
she
surely
knows
only
for
her
has
this
house
hoarded
up
its
silences
since
the
beginning
of
the
early
years
and
that
this
night
her
soul
shall
dwell
at
ease
and
grow
forgetful
of
its
ancient
fears
in
some
unviolated
room
and
so
the
quiet
city
no
more
hears
her
footsteps
and
the
streets
their
dust
resume
but
what
have
i
to
do
with
her
and
death
who
hold
these
living
grasses
in
my
hands
with
her
who
liveth
not
yet
sorroweth
for
it
shall
chance
however
close
the
bands
of
sleep
be
drawn
about
her
nevertheless
she
must
remember
alway
the
old
lands
she
wandered
in
and
their
old
hollowness
here
the
strong
word
of
the
trees
my
soul
leans
over
to
the
caress
one
with
the
flowers
far
off
it
hears
the
rumor
of
large
unmeasured
things
and
yet
it
has
no
yearning
to
remix
with
these
for
the
pines
whisper
lest
it
may
forget
of
the
near
pool
and
how
the
shadow
lies
on
it
forever
and
of
its
edges
set
with
and
how
in
the
alder
trees
bend
over
until
one
forgets
the
color
of
the
unseen
skies
and
loses
all
remembrance
of
the
sun
no
echo
there
of
the
loss
and
pain
nor
sound
of
little
rivers
even
that
run
where
with
the
wind
the
hollow
reeds
complain
nor
the
soft
stir
of
when
dawn
comes
in
with
quiet
covering
of
rain
only
all
day
the
shadow
of
peace
upon
the
gray
breast
and
with
the
fall
of
even
the
noiseless
gleam
of
scattered
from
the
unfathomed
treasuries
of
heaven
and
as
the
sea
has
not
the
strength
to
win
back
to
its
love
my
soul
o
comrades
in
the
wood
lost
and
seeking
me
are
not
less
impotent
than
all
the
sea
my
soul
at
last
its
ultimate
house
hath
won
and
in
that
house
shall
sleep
along
with
me
yea
we
shall
slumber
softly
out
of
the
sun
to
day
and
night
alike
indifferent
aware
and
unaware
if
time
be
done
yet
ere
i
go
ere
yet
your
faith
be
spent
for
our
old
love
i
pass
message
on
in
me
why
shouldst
thou
not
find
thy
content
are
not
my
days
surpassing
fair
from
dawn
to
sunset
and
my
nights
fulfilled
with
peace
shall
not
my
strength
remain
when
thou
art
gone
the
way
of
all
blown
dust
shall
beauty
cease
upon
my
face
because
thy
face
grows
gray
behold
thine
hours
even
now
fade
and
decrease
and
thou
hast
got
no
wisdom
yet
i
say
this
thing
there
is
to
learn
ere
thou
must
go
no
sad
thoughts
of
me
upon

aloud

you
o

her

word
that

be

glad
