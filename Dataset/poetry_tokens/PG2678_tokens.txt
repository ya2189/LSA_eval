poems
by
emily
dickinson
series
one
edited
by
two
of
her
friends
mabel
loomis
todd
and
preface
the
verses
of
emily
dickinson
belong
emphatically
to
what
emerson
long
since
called
the
poetry
of
the
portfolio
something
produced
absolutely
without
the
thought
of
publication
and
solely
by
way
of
expression
of
the
writer
own
mind
such
verse
must
inevitably
forfeit
whatever
advantage
lies
in
the
discipline
of
public
criticism
and
the
enforced
conformity
to
accepted
ways
on
the
other
hand
it
may
often
gain
something
through
the
habit
of
freedom
and
the
unconventional
utterance
of
daring
thoughts
in
the
case
of
the
present
author
there
was
absolutely
no
choice
in
the
matter
she
must
write
thus
or
not
at
all
a
recluse
by
temperament
and
habit
literally
spending
years
without
setting
her
foot
beyond
the
doorstep
and
many
more
years
during
which
her
walks
were
strictly
limited
to
her
father
grounds
she
habitually
concealed
her
mind
like
her
person
from
all
but
a
very
few
friends
and
it
was
with
great
difficulty
that
she
was
persuaded
to
print
during
her
lifetime
three
or
four
poems
yet
she
wrote
verses
in
great
abundance
and
though
brought
curiously
indifferent
to
all
conventional
rules
had
yet
a
rigorous
literary
standard
of
her
own
and
often
altered
a
word
many
times
to
suit
an
ear
which
had
its
own
tenacious
fastidiousness
miss
dickinson
was
born
in
amherst
and
died
there
may
her
father
hon
edward
dickinson
was
the
leading
lawyer
of
amherst
and
was
treasurer
of
the
college
there
situated
it
was
his
custom
once
a
year
to
hold
a
large
reception
at
his
house
attended
by
all
the
families
connected
with
the
institution
and
by
the
leading
people
of
the
town
on
these
occasions
his
daughter
emily
emerged
from
her
wonted
retirement
and
did
her
part
as
gracious
hostess
nor
would
any
one
have
known
from
her
manner
i
have
been
told
that
this
was
not
a
daily
occurrence
the
annual
occasion
once
past
she
withdrew
again
into
her
seclusion
and
except
for
a
very
few
friends
was
as
invisible
to
the
world
as
if
she
had
dwelt
in
a
nunnery
for
myself
although
i
had
corresponded
with
her
for
many
years
i
saw
her
but
twice
face
to
face
and
brought
away
the
impression
of
something
as
unique
and
remote
as
undine
or
mignon
or
thekla
this
selection
from
her
poems
is
published
to
meet
the
desire
of
her
personal
friends
and
especially
of
her
surviving
sister
it
is
believed
that
the
thoughtful
reader
will
find
in
these
pages
a
quality
more
suggestive
of
the
poetry
of
william
blake
than
of
anything
to
be
elsewhere
found
flashes
of
wholly
original
and
profound
insight
into
nature
and
life
words
and
phrases
exhibiting
an
extraordinary
vividness
of
descriptive
and
imaginative
power
yet
often
set
in
a
seemingly
whimsical
or
even
rugged
frame
they
are
here
published
as
they
were
written
with
very
few
and
superficial
changes
although
it
is
fair
to
say
that
the
titles
have
been
assigned
almost
invariably
by
the
editors
in
many
cases
these
verses
will
seem
to
the
reader
like
poetry
torn
up
by
the
roots
with
rain
and
dew
and
earth
still
clinging
to
them
giving
a
freshness
and
a
fragrance
not
otherwise
to
be
conveyed
in
other
cases
as
in
the
few
poems
of
shipwreck
or
of
mental
conflict
we
can
only
wonder
at
the
gift
of
vivid
imagination
by
which
this
recluse
woman
can
delineate
by
a
few
touches
the
very
crises
of
physical
or
mental
struggle
and
sometimes
again
we
catch
glimpses
of
a
lyric
strain
sustained
perhaps
but
for
a
line
or
two
at
a
time
and
making
the
reader
regret
its
sudden
cessation
but
the
main
quality
of
these
poems
is
that
of
extraordinary
grasp
and
insight
uttered
with
an
uneven
vigor
sometimes
exasperating
seemingly
wayward
but
really
unsought
and
inevitable
after
all
when
a
thought
takes
breath
away
a
lesson
on
grammar
seems
an
impertinence
as
ruskin
wrote
in
his
earlier
and
better
days
no
weight
nor
mass
nor
beauty
of
execution
can
outweigh
one
grain
or
fragment
of
thought

higginson
transcriber
note
as
is
well
documented
emily
dickinson
poems
were
edited
in
these
early
editions
by
her
friends
better
to
fit
the
conventions
of
the
times
in
particular
her
dashes
often
small
enough
to
appear
as
dots
became
commas
and
in
the
second
series
of
poems
published
a
facsimile
of
her
handwritten
poem
which
her
editors
titled
renunciation
is
given
and
i
here
transcribe
that
manuscript
as
faithfully
as
i
can
showing
words
thus
there
came
a
day
at
summer
full
entirely
for
me
i
thought
that
such
were
for
the
saints
where
resurrections
be
the
sun
as
common
went
abroad
the
flowers
accustomed
blew
as
if
no
soul
that
solstice
passed
which
maketh
all
things
new
the
time
was
scarce
profaned
by
speech
the
falling
of
a
word
was
needless
as
at
sacrament
the
of
our
lord
each
was
to
each
the
sealed
church
permitted
to
commune
time
lest
we
too
awkward
show
at
supper
of
the
lamb
the
hours
slid
fast
as
hours
will
clutched
tight
by
greedy
hands
so
faces
on
two
decks
look
back
bound
to
lands
and
so
when
all
the
time
had
leaked
without
external
sound
each
bound
the
other
crucifix
we
gave
no
other
bond
sufficient
troth
that
we
shall
deposed
at
length
the
grave
to
that
new
marriage
through
calvaries
of
love
from
the
handwriting
it
is
not
always
clear
which
are
dashes
which
are
commas
and
which
are
periods
nor
it
is
entirely
clear
which
initial
letters
are
capitalized
however
this
transcription
may
be
compared
with
the
edited
version
in
the
main
text
to
get
a
flavor
of
the
changes
made
in
these
early
editions
this
is
my
letter
to
the
world
that
never
wrote
to
me
the
simple
news
that
nature
told
with
tender
majesty
her
message
is
committed
to
hands
i
can
not
see
for
love
of
her
sweet
countrymen
judge
tenderly
of
me

success
published
in
a
masque
of
poets
at
the
request
of
the
and
friend
success
is
counted
sweetest
by
those
who
succeed
to
comprehend
a
nectar
requires
sorest
need
not
one
of
all
the
purple
host
who
took
the
flag
can
tell
the
definition
so
clear
of
victory
as
he
defeated
dying
on
whose
forbidden
ear
the
distant
strains
of
triumph
break
agonized
and
clear
ii
our
share
of
night
to
bear
our
share
of
morning
our
blank
in
bliss
to
fill
our
blank
in
scorning
here
a
star
and
there
a
star
some
lose
their
way
here
a
mist
and
there
a
mist

rouge
et
noir
soul
wilt
thou
toss
again
by
just
such
a
hazard
hundreds
have
lost
indeed
but
tens
have
won
an
all
angels
breathless
ballot
lingers
to
record
thee
imps
in
eager
caucus
raffle
for
my
soul
iv
rouge
gagne
is
so
much
joy
is
so
much
joy
if
i
should
fail
what
poverty
and
yet
as
poor
as
i
have
ventured
all
upon
a
throw
have
gained
yes
hesitated
so
this
side
the
victory
life
is
but
life
and
death
but
death
bliss
is
but
bliss
and
breath
but
breath
and
if
indeed
i
fail
at
least
to
know
the
worst
is
sweet
defeat
means
nothing
but
defeat
no
drearier
can
prevail
and
if
i
gain
oh
gun
at
sea
oh
bells
that
in
the
steeples
be
at
first
repeat
it
slow
for
heaven
is
a
different
thing
conjectured
and
waked
sudden
in
and
might
me
so
glee
the
great
storm
is
over
four
have
recovered
the
land
forty
gone
down
together
into
the
boiling
sand
ring
for
the
scant
salvation
toll
for
the
bonnie
souls
neighbor
and
friend
and
bridegroom
spinning
upon
the
shoals
how
they
will
tell
the
shipwreck
when
winter
shakes
the
door
till
the
children
ask
but
the
forty
did
they
come
back
no
more
then
a
silence
suffuses
the
story
and
a
softness
the
teller
eye
and
the
children
no
further
question
and
only
the
waves
reply
vi
if
i
can
stop
one
heart
from
breaking
i
shall
not
live
in
vain
if
i
can
ease
one
life
the
aching
or
cool
one
pain
or
help
one
fainting
robin
unto
his
nest
again
i
shall
not
live
in
vain
vii
almost
within
my
reach
i
could
have
touched
i
might
have
chanced
that
way
soft
sauntered
through
the
village
sauntered
as
soft
away
so
unsuspected
violets
within
the
fields
lie
low
too
late
for
striving
fingers
that
passed
an
hour
ago
viii
a
wounded
deer
leaps
highest
i
heard
the
hunter
tell
is
but
the
ecstasy
of
death
and
then
the
brake
is
still
the
smitten
rock
that
gushes
the
trampled
steel
that
springs
a
cheek
is
always
redder
just
where
the
hectic
stings
mirth
is
the
mail
of
anguish
in
which
it
cautions
arm
lest
anybody
spy
the
blood
and
you
hurt
exclaim
ix
the
heart
asks
pleasure
first
and
then
excuse
from
pain
and
then
those
little
anodynes
that
deaden
suffering
and
then
to
go
to
sleep
and
then
if
it
should
be
the
will
of
its
inquisitor
the
liberty
to
die
x
in
a
library
a
precious
mouldering
pleasure
is
to
meet
an
antique
book
in
just
the
dress
his
century
wore
a
privilege
i
think
his
venerable
hand
to
take
and
warming
in
our
own
a
passage
back
or
two
to
make
to
times
when
he
was
young
his
quaint
opinions
to
inspect
his
knowledge
to
unfold
on
what
concerns
our
mutual
mind
the
literature
of
old
what
interested
scholars
most
what
competitions
ran
when
plato
was
a
certainty
and
sophocles
a
man
when
sappho
was
a
living
girl
and
beatrice
wore
the
gown
that
dante
deified
facts
centuries
before
he
traverses
familiar
as
one
should
come
to
town
and
tell
you
all
your
dreams
were
true
he
lived
where
dreams
were
sown
his
presence
is
enchantment
you
beg
him
not
to
go
old
volumes
shake
their
vellum
heads
and
tantalize
just
so
xi
much
madness
is
divinest
sense
to
a
discerning
eye
much
sense
the
starkest
madness
is
the
majority
in
this
as
all
prevails
assent
and
you
are
sane
demur
you
straightway
dangerous
and
handled
with
a
chain
xii
i
asked
no
other
thing
no
other
was
denied
i
offered
being
for
it
the
mighty
merchant
smiled

he
twirled
a
button
without
a

my
way
but
madam
is
there
nothing
else
that
we
can
show

her

shuts
the
door

her
divine

no
more
unmoved

notes
the
chariot
pausing
at
her
low
gate
unmoved
an
emperor
is
kneeling
upon
her
mat
i
known
her
from
an
ample
nation

one
then
close
the
valves
of
her
attention
like
stone
xiv
the

things
that

some
things
that

expound

xv
the
lonely
house
i
know
some
lonely
houses
off
the
road
a
robber
like
the
look
of
wooden
barred
and
windows
hanging
low
inviting
to
a
portico
where
two
could
creep
one
hand
the
tools
the
other
peep
to
make
sure
all
asleep
eyes
not
easy
to
surprise
how
orderly
the
kitchen
look
by
night
with
just
a
clock
but
they
could
gag
the
tick
and
mice
wo
bark
and
so
the
walls
do
tell
none
will
a
pair
of
spectacles
ajar
just
stir
an
almanac
aware
was
it
the
mat
winked
or
a
nervous
star
the
moon
slides
down
the
stair
to
see
who
there
there
plunder
where
tankard
or
spoon
earring
or
stone
a
watch
some
ancient
brooch
to
match
the
grandmamma
staid
sleeping
there
day
rattles
too
stealth
slow
the
sun
has
got
as
far
as
the
third
sycamore
screams
chanticleer
who
there
and
echoes
trains
away
sneer
where
while
the
old
couple
just
astir
fancy
the
sunrise
left
the
door
ajar
xvi
to
fight
aloud
is
very
brave
but
gallanter
i
know
who
charge
within
the
bosom
the
cavalry
of
woe
who
win
and
nations
do
not
see
who
fall
and
none
observe
whose
dying
eyes
no
country
regards
with
patriot
love
we
trust
in
plumed
procession
for
such
the
angels
go
rank
after
rank
with
even
feet
and
uniforms
of
snow
xvii
dawn
when
night
is
almost
done
and
sunrise
grows
so
near
that
we
can
touch
the
spaces
it
time
to
smooth
the
hair
and
get
the
dimples
ready
and
wonder
we
could
care
for
that
old
faded
midnight
that
frightened
but
an
hour
xviii
the
book
of
martyrs
read
sweet
how
others
strove
till
we
are
stouter
what
they
renounced
till
we
are
less
afraid
how
many
times
they
bore
the
faithful
witness
till
we
are
helped
as
if
a
kingdom
cared
read
then
of
faith
that
shone
above
the
fagot
clear
strains
of
hymn
the
river
could
not
drown
brave
names
of
men
and
celestial
women
passed
out
of
record
into
renown
xix
the
mystery
of
pain
pain
has
an
element
of
blank
it
can
not
recollect
when
it
began
or
if
there
were
a
day
when
it
was
not
it
has
no
future
but
itself
its
infinite
realms
contain
its
past
enlightened
to
perceive
new
periods
of
pain
xx
i
taste
a
liquor
never
brewed
from
tankards
scooped
in
pearl
not
all
the
vats
upon
the
rhine
yield
such
an
alcohol
inebriate
of
air
am
i
and
debauchee
of
dew
reeling
through
endless
summer
days
from
inns
of
molten
blue
when
landlords
turn
the
drunken
bee
out
of
the
foxglove
door
when
butterflies
renounce
their
drams
i
shall
but
drink
the
more
till
seraphs
swing
their
snowy
hats
and
saints
to
windows
run
to
see
the
little
tippler
leaning
against
the
sun
xxi
a
book
he
ate
and
drank
the
precious
words
his
spirit
grew
robust
he
knew
no
more
that
he
was
poor
nor
that
his
frame
was
dust
he
danced
along
the
dingy
days
and
this
bequest
of
wings
was
but
a
book
what
liberty
a
loosened
spirit
brings
xxii
i
had
no
time
to
hate
because
the
grave
would
hinder
me
and
life
was
not
so
ample
i
could
finish
enmity
nor
had
i
time
to
love
but
since
some
industry
must
be
the
little
toil
of
love
i
thought
was
large
enough
for
me
xxiii
unreturning
was
such
a
little
little
boat
that
toddled
down
the
bay
was
such
a
gallant
gallant
sea
that
beckoned
it
away
was
such
a
greedy
greedy
wave
that
licked
it
from
the
coast
nor
ever
guessed
the
stately
sails
my
little
craft
was
lost
xxiv
whether
my
bark
went
down
at
sea
whether
she
met
with
gales
whether
to
isles
enchanted
she
bent
her
docile
sails
by
what
mystic
mooring
she
is
held
this
is
the
errand
of
the
eye
out
upon
the
bay
xxv
belshazzar

a
letter
he
never
had
but
one
belshazzar

concluded
and

in

immortal

xxvi
the
brain
within
its
groove
runs
evenly

true
but
let
a
splinter
swerve
were
easier
for
you
to
put
the
water
back
when
floods
have
slit
the
hills
and
scooped
a
turnpike
for
themselves
and
blotted
out
the
mills

there

little
brook

overflow

come
hurrying
from

go

be
when
the

brook

some
burning

arctic
flower
upon

on

back

so
when
all
the

failed
without

gave

i
tell
you
how
the

rose
a

the

swam
in
amethyst
the

like
squirrels
ran
the
hills
untied
their
bonnets
the

i
said
softly
to
myself
that
must
have
been
the
sun
but
how
he
set
i
know
not
there
seemed
a
purple
stile
which
little
yellow
boys

girls
were
climbing
all
the
while
till
when
they
reached
the
other
side
a

gently
up

the

there
not
a

to
me

phraseless

wind
does
working
like
a
hand
whose
fingers
brush
the
sky
then
quiver
down
with
tufts
of
tune
permitted
gods
and
me
when
winds
go
round

round
in
bands

thrum
upon
the

birds
take
places
overhead

him
grace
of

boughs
if
such
an
outcast

he
never
heard
that
fleshless
chant
rise
solemn
in
the

if
some
caravan
of
sound
on
deserts
in
the

had
broken
rank

knit

passed
in

xxv
death

with

the

shook

all

said

so
as

between

the

to

just
how

if
any
human

were
near
to
whom
he
could
intrust
his
wavering
gaze
until
it
settled
firm
on

if
he
was
patient
part
content

dying

he
thought

it
a
pleasant
day

did
the
sunshine
face
his
way
what
was
his

mind

what

say
at

that
he
ceased
human
nature
on
such
a
day

any
just
his
sigh
accented
had
been
legible
to
me

was
he
confident
until
ill
fluttered
out
in
everlasting
well
and
if
he
spoke
what
name
was
best
what
first
what
one
broke
off
with
at
the
drowsiest

he
afraid

tranquil
might
he

how
conscious
consciousness
could
grow

love

was

love
too

be

the
last
night

the

so
nearly
infinite
we
waited
while
she
passed
it
was
a
narrow
time
too
jostled
were
our
souls
to
speak
at
length
the
notice
came
she
mentioned
and
forgot
then
lightly
as
a
reed
bent
to
the
water
shivered
scarce
consented
and
was
dead
and
we
we
placed
the
hair
and
drew
the
head
erect
and
then
an
awful
leisure
was
our
faith
to
regulate
xxi
the
first
lesson
not
in
this

see
his
face

just
the
primer

a
life
unopened
rare

shelf
clasped

to
him

me

my
primer

he
passed
quickly
round
if
pride
shall
be
in
paradise
i
never
can
decide
of
their
imperial
conduct
no
person
testified
but
proud
in
apparition
that
woman
and
her
boy
pass
back
and
forth
before
my
brain
as
ever
in
the
sky

the
daisy
follows
soft
the
sun
and
when
his
golden
walk
is
done
sits
shyly
at
his
feet
he
waking
finds
the
flower
near
wherefore
marauder
art
thou
here
because
sir
love
is
sweet
we
are
the
flower
thou
the
sun
forgive
us
if
as
days
decline
we
nearer
steal
to
thee
enamoured
of
the
parting
west
the
peace
the
flight

emancipation
no
rack
can
torture
me
my
soul
at
liberty
behind
this
mortal
bone
there
knits
a
bolder
one
you
can
not
prick
with
saw
nor
rend
with
scymitar
two
bodies
therefore
be
bind
one
and
one
will
flee
the
eagle
of
his
nest
no
easier
divest
and
gain
the
sky
than
mayest
thou
except
thyself
may
be
thine
enemy
captivity
is
consciousness
so
liberty

lost
a

anybody
found

it
by
the
row
of
stars
around
its
forehead
bound
a
rich
man
might
not
notice
it
yet
to
my
frugal
eye
of
more
esteem
than
ducats
oh
find
it
sir
for
me
xxxvii

should

the
robins
come

the

shall

have
ceased

wonder
why
christ
will
explain
each
separate
anguish
in
the
fair
schoolroom
of

he
will
tell
me
what
peter
promised

i
for
wonder
at
his
woe
i
shall
forget
the
drop
of
anguish
that
scalds
me
