preface
this
is
not
like
other
collections
of
religious
verse
still
less
is
it
a
hymnal
the
present
volume
is
directed
to
a
very
specific
and
wholly
practical
end
the
production
of
high
personal
character
and
only
those
poems
which
have
an
immediate
bearing
in
this
direction
have
been
admitted
we
know
of
no
other
book
published
which
has
followed
this
special
line
there
are
fine
hymnals
deservedly
dear
to
the
church
but
they
are
necessarily
devoted
in
large
measure
to
institutional
and
theological
subjects
are
adapted
to
the
wants
of
the
general
congregation
and
to
purposes
of
song
while
many
poetical
productions
that
touch
the
heart
the
closest
are
for
that
very
reason
unsuited
to
the
hymnal
there
are
many
anthologies
and
plentiful
volumes
of
religious
poetry
but
not
one
coming
within
our
ken
has
been
made
up
as
this
has
been
we
have
sought
far
and
wide
through
many
libraries
carefully
conning
hundreds
of
books
and
glancing
through
hundreds
more
to
find
just
those
lines
which
would
have
the
most
tonic
and
stimulating
effect
in
the
direction
of
holier
nobler
living
we
have
coveted
verses
whose
influence
would
be
directly
on
daily
life
and
would
help
to
form
the
very
best
habits
of
thought
and
conduct
which
would
have
intrinsic
spiritual
value
and
elevating
power
those
whose
immediate
tendency
would
be
to
make
people
better
toughening
their
moral
fibre
and
helping
them
heavenward
those
which
they
could
hardly
read
attentively
without
feeling
an
impulse
toward
the
things
which
are
pure
and
true
and
honorable
and
lovely
and
of
good
report
things
virtuous
and
praiseworthy
it
is
surprising
to
one
who
has
not
made
the
search
how
very
many
poets
there
are
whose
voluminous
and
popular
works
yield
nothing
or
scarcely
anything
of
this
sort
we
have
looked
carefully
through
many
scores
of
volumes
of
poetry
without
finding
a
line
that
could
be
of
the
slightest
use
in
this
collection
they
were
taken
up
altogether
with
other
topics
they
contained
many
pretty
conceits
pleasant
descriptions
lovely
or
lively
narrations
these
in
abundance
but
words
that
would
send
the
spirit
heavenward
or
even
earthward
with
any
added
love
for
humanity
not
one
on
the
other
hand
in
papers
and
periodicals
even
in
books
are
great
multitudes
of
verses
unexceptionable
in
sentiment
and
helpful
in
influence
which
bear
so
little
of
the
true
poetic
afflatus
are
so
careless
in
construction
or
so
faulty
in
diction
so
imperfect
in
rhyme
or
rhythm
so
much
mingled
with
colloquialisms
or
so
hopelessly
commonplace
in
thought
as
to
be
unworthy
of
a
permanent
place
in
a
book
like
this
they
would
not
bear
reading
many
times
they
would
offend
a
properly
educated
taste
they
would
not
so
capture
the
ear
as
to
linger
on
the
memory
with
compelling
persistence
nor
strike
the
intellect
as
an
exceptional
presentation
of
important
truth
the
combination
of
fine
form
and
deep
or
inspiring
thought
is
by
no
means
common
but
when
found
very
precious
we
will
not
claim
that
this
has
been
secured
in
all
the
poems
here
presented
not
all
will
approve
our
choice
in
all
respects
there
is
nothing
in
which
tastes
more
differ
than
in
matters
of
this
kind
and
we
will
admit
that
in
some
cases
we
have
let
in
because
of
the
important
truth
which
they
so
well
voiced
stanzas
not
fully
up
to
the
mark
in
point
of
poetic
merit
where
it
has
not
been
possible
to
get
the
two
desirable
things
together
as
it
has
not
always
we
have
been
more
solicitous
for
the
sentiment
that
would
benefit
than
for
mere
prettiness
or
perfection
of
form
helpfulness
has
been
the
test
oftener
than
a
high
literary
standard
the
labored
workmanship
of
the
vessel
has
not
weighed
so
much
with
us
as
its
perfect
fitness
to
convey
the
water
of
life
wherewith
the
thirsty
soul
of
man
has
been
or
may
be
refreshed
if
poets
are
properly
judged
as
has
been
alleged
by
the
frame
of
mind
they
induce
then
some
who
have
not
gained
great
literary
fame
may
still
hold
up
their
heads
and
claim
a
worthy
crown
some
poems
fully
within
the
scope
of
the
book
like
longfellow
psalm
of
life
have
been
omitted
because
of
their
exceeding
commonness
and
their
accessibility
many
hymns
of
very
high
value
like
jesus
lover
of
my
soul
my
faith
looks
up
to
thee
nearer
my
god
to
thee
when
all
thy
mercies
o
my
god
how
firm
a
foundation
have
also
been
omitted
because
they
are
found
in
all
the
hymnals
and
to
include
them
would
unduly
swell
the
size
of
the
book
a
few
others
although
similarly
familiar
like
jesus
i
my
cross
have
taken
and
god
moves
in
a
mysterious
way
have
been
inserted
from
a
feeling
that
even
yet
their
depth
and
richness
are
not
properly
appreciated
and
that
they
can
never
be
sufficiently
pondered
a
few
poems
we
have
been
unable
to
procure
permission
to
use
but
in
nearly
all
cases
we
have
met
with
most
generous
treatment
from
both
authors
and
publishers
owning
copyrights

we
take

in
spite
of
much

it

quite
likely
we

usual

and
we
hope
that
if

be
pardoned

the
number
of
american
poets
drawn
upon
is
small
compared
with
this
list
it
is
the
case
in
all
such
collections
according
to
an
analysis
of
the
hymns
contained
in
the
most
widely
used
american
hymnals
down
to
the
average
number
of
hymns
of
purely
american
origin
was
not
quite
one
in
seven
the
proportion
would
be
a
little
larger
now
and
the
number
of
methodist
poets
is
almost
nil
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
compiler
is
a
methodist
and
the
volume
is
issued
from
the
official
methodist
publishing
house
but
if
we
thought
that
this
would
be
any
barrier
to
its
wide
circulation
in
methodist
homes
we
should
be
deeply
ashamed
for
our
church
we
are
confident
it
will
not
be
for
mere
denominational
tenets
do
not
at
all
enter
into
these
great
matters
of
the
soul
life
a
book
like
this
speaks
loudly
for
the
real
oneness
not
only
of
all
branches
of
the
christian
church
but
of
all
religions
in
some
respects
not
only
do
we
find
the
various
protestant
denominations
amply
represented
here
not
only
have
we
most
inspiring
words
from
roman
catholic
writers
like
francis
xavier
madame
guyon
alexander
pope
john
henry
newman
frederick
faber
and
adelaide
anne
procter
but
from
mohammedan
sources
from
sufi
saints
of
persia
and
the
moslem
devotees
of
arabia
and
even
from
hinduism
there
are
utterances
of
noblest
truth
which
we
can
not
read
without
a
kindling
heart
these
are
all
brought
together
from
the
ends
of
the
earth
into
a
delightful
upper
chamber
where
the
warring
discords
of
opinion
cease
and
an
exceedingly
precious
peace
prevails
it
should
be
said
though
it
is
perhaps
hardly
necessary
that
this
is
by
no
means
a
book
to
be
read
at
a
sitting
it
furnishes
very
concentrated
nourishment
it
can
be
taken
with
largest
profit
only
a
little
at
a
time
according
as
the
mood
demands
and
circumstances
appoint
there
should
be
very
much
meditation
mingled
with
the
perusal
an
attempt
to
penetrate
the
deep
meaning
of
the
lines
and
have
them
enter
into
the
soul
for
practical
benefit
some
of
these
hymns
have
great
histories
they
are
the
war
cries
of
combatants
on
battle
fields
they
are
living
words
of
deep
experience
pressed
out
of
the
heart
by
strong
feeling
they
are
the
embodiment
of
visions
caught
on
some
pisgah
glowing
top
here
will
be
found
and
furnished
hope
for
the
rest
for
the
weary
courage
for
the
trembling
cheer
for
the
despondent
power
for
the
weak
comfort
for
the
afflicted
guidance
in
times
of
difficulty
wise
counsel
for
moments
of
perplexity
a
stimulant
to
faithfulness
a
cure
for
the
blues
exhilaration
jubilation
everything
of
a
depressing
nature
has
been
scrupulously
ruled
out
the
keynote
persistently
followed
through
all
the
pages
is
optimistic
bright
buoyant
trumpet
calls
and
bugle
notes
are
furnished
in
abundance
but
no
dirges
or
elegies
large
space
it
will
be
seen
is
given
to
such
topics
as
heroism
true
greatness
the
care
and
presence
of
god
the
blessings
of
brotherliness
the
privilege
of
service
the
path
of
peace
the
secret
of
contentment
the
mission
of
prayer
the
joy
of
jesus
the
meaning
of
life
the
glory
of
love
the
promise
of
faith
the
happy
aspect
of
old
age
and
death
for
these
subjects
come
very
close
home
to
the
heart
and
are
illustrated
in
daily
experience
anyone
who
feels
a
special
need
in
any
of
these
directions
is
confidently
recommended
to
turn
to
the
proper
sections
and
read
the
selections
very
much
that
is
here
may
easily
and
suitably
be
committed
to
memory
that
thus
it
may
the
more
permanently
penetrate
into
the
inmost
depth
of
being
it
may
be
used
with
most
telling
effect
in
sermons
to
give
point
and
pungency
to
the
thought
of
the
preacher
alike
in
popular
discourse
and
public
testimony
or
in
private
meditation
these
gems
of
sentiment
and
thought
will
come
into
play
with
great
advantage
the
benefit
which
may
be
derived
from
them
can
scarcely
be
overestimated
president
eliot
of
harvard
university
has
said
there
are
bits
of
poetry
in
my
mind
learned
in
infancy
that
have
stood
by
me
in
keeping
me
true
to
my
ideas
of
duty
and
life
rather
than
lose
these
i
would
have
missed
all
the
sermons
i
have
ever
heard
many
another
can
say
substantially
the
same
can
trace
his
best
deeds
very
largely
to
the
influence
of
some
little
stanza
or
couplet
early
stored
away
in
his
memory
and
coming
ever
freshly
to
mind
in
after
years
as
the
embodiment
of
truest
wisdom
we
can
not
guarantee
in
all
cases
the
absolute
correctness
of
the
forms
of
the
poems
given
though
much
pains
have
been
taken
to
ensure
accuracy
but
authors
themselves
make
changes
in
their
productions
at
different
times
in
different
editions
nor
have
we
always
been
able
to
trace
the
poem
to
its
source
slips
and
errors
of
various
kinds
can
hardly
be
avoided
in
such
matters
even
so
competent
an
editor
as
john
whittier
in
his
songs
of
three
centuries
ascribes
love
divine
all
love
excelling
to
that
bitter
calvinist
augustus
toplady
giving
it
as
the
sole
specimen
of
his
verse
when
it
was
really
written
by
the
ardent
arminian
charles
wesley
with
whom
toplady
was
on
anything
but
friendly
terms
if
whittier
could
make
a
blunder
of
this
magnitude
we
may
be
pardoned
if
possibly
a
critic
spies
something
in
our
book
almost
as
grossly
incorrect
in
some
cases
we
have
been
obliged
to
change
the
titles
of
poems
so
as
to
avoid
reduplication
in
our
index
or
to
adapt
them
the
better
to
the
small
extract
taken
from
the
much
longer
form
in
the
original
in
a
few
cases
we
have
made
indicated
alterations
in
poems
to
fit
them
more
fully
to
the
purpose
of
the
book
the
volume
will
be
found
not
only
a
readable
one
we
think
but
also
an
uncommonly
useful
one
for
presentation
by
those
who
would
do
good
and
give
gratification
to
their
friends
with
a
taste
for
religious
poetry
and
a
love
for
wandering
in
the
holy
land
of
song
he
who
would
put
before
another
the
essential
elements
of
religion
would
do
better
to
give
him
such
a
book
as
this
than
a
treatise
on
theology
he
who
would
himself
get
a
clear
idea
of
what
the
religious
life
really
is
will
do
better
to
pore
over
these
pages
than
to
dip
into
some
philosophical
discussion
here
the
best
life
is
expressed
rather
than
analyzed
exhibited
rather
than
explained
browning
has
well
said
plant
a
poet
word
deep
enough
in
any
man
breast
looking
presently
for
offshoots
and
you
have
done
more
for
the
man
than
if
you
dressed
him
in
a
broadcloth
coat
and
warmed
his
sunday
pottage
at
your
fire
we
who
by
preparing
or
circulating
such
volumes
aid
the
poets
in
finding
a
larger
circle
to
whom
to
give
their
message
may
claim
a
part
of
the
blessing
which
comes
to
those
who
in
any
way
aid
humanity
george
herbert
has
said
a
verse
may
find
him
who
a
sermon
flies
and
turn
delight
into
a
sacrifice
he
himself
most
excellently
illustrated
the
sentiment
by
bequeathing
to
the
world
many
beautiful
verses
that
are
sermons
of
the
most
picturesque
sort
one
definition
of
poetry
is
a
record
of
the
best
thoughts
and
best
moments
of
the
best
and
happiest
minds
this
in
itself
would
almost
be
sufficient
to
establish
the
connection
between
poetry
and
religion
it
is
certain
that
the
two
have
very
close
and
vital
relations
washington
gladden
has
admirably
remarked
poetry
is
indebted
to
religion
for
its
largest
and
loftiest
inspirations
and
religion
is
indebted
to
poetry
for
its
subtlest
and
most
luminous
interpretations
no
doubt
a
man
may
be
truly
deeply
religious
who
has
little
or
no
development
on
the
√¶sthetic
side
to
whom
poetry
makes
no
special
appeal
but
it
is
certain
that
he
whose
soul
is
deaf
to
the
concord
of
sweet
sounds
misses
a
mighty
aid
in
the
spiritual
life
for
a
hymn
is
a
wing
by
which
the
spirit
soars
above
earthly
cares
and
trials
into
a
purer
air
and
a
clearer
sunshine
nothing
can
better
scatter
the
devils
of
melancholy
and
gloom
or
doubt
and
fear
when
praise
and
prayer
trust
and
love
faith
and
hope
and
similar
sentiments
have
passed
into
and
through
some
poet
passionate
soul
until
he
has
become
so
charged
with
them
that
he
has
been
able
to
fix
them
in
a
form
of
expression
where
beauty
is
united
to
strength
where
concentration
and
ornamentation
are
alike
secured
then
the
deepest
needs
of
great
numbers
are
fully
met
what
was
vague
and
dim
is
brought
into
light
what
was
only
half
conceived
and
so
but
half
felt
is
made
to
grip
the
soul
with
power
poetry
is
of
the
very
highest
value
for
the
inspiration
and
guidance
of
life
for
calling
out
the
emotions
and
opening
up
spiritual
visions
it
carries
truths
not
only
into
the
understanding
but
into
the
heart
where
they
are
likely
to
have
the
most
direct
effect

for
his
faith

is
fine
more
than
most
of
us
do
but
say
can
you
add
to
that
line
that
he
lived
for
it
too
in
his
death
he
bore
witness
at
last
as
a
martyr
to
truth
did
his
life
do
the

days

it

die
men
have
died
for
a
wish
or

whim
from
bravado
or
passion
or
pride
was
it
harder
for
him

to
live
every

to
live
out
all
the
truth
that
he
dreamt
while
his
friends
met
his
conduct
with

not
theirs
the
sudden
anguish
swift

their
hearts
are
worn

wasted
with
small
cares
with
daily
griefs
and
thrusts
from
foes
unseen
troubles
and
trials
that
take
them
unawares
theirs
is
a
lingering
silent
martyrdom
they
weep
through
weary
years
and
long
for
rest
to
come
they
weep
but
murmur
not
it
is
god
will
and
they
have
learned
to
bend
their
own
to
his
simply
enduring
knowing
that
each
ill
is
but
the
herald
of
some
future
bliss
striving
and
suffering

so
silently
they
know
it

seem
to
know
them
best

work

heroism
it
takes
great
strength

train
to
modern

your
ancestral
brain

lift
the
weight
of
the
unnumbered
years
of
dead

to
hold
that
back
with

with

that
drags

it

other
people
think
that
you
are
wrong
people
you
love

who
love
you

whose
approval
is
a
pleasure
you
would
choose
to
bear
this
pressure

succeed
at

in

it

courage
too
but
what
does
courage
mean
save
strength
to
help
you
face
a
pain
foreseen
courage
to
undertake
this
lifelong
strain
of
setting
yours
against
your
brain
dangerous
risk
of
walking
lone
and
free
out
of
the
easy
paths
that
used
to
be
and
the
fierce
pain
of
hurting
those
we
love
when
love
meets
truth
and
truth
must
ride
above
but
the
best
courage
man
has
ever
shown
is
daring
to
cut
loose
and
think
alone
dark
are
the
unlit
chambers
of
clear
space
where
light
shines
back
from
no
reflecting
face
our
sun
wide
glare
our
heaven
shining
blue
we
owe
to
fog

they
fumble
through
and
our
rich
wisdom
that
we
treasure
so
shines
from
the
thousand
things
that
we
do
know

to
think
new
it
takes
a
courage
grim
as
led
columbus
over
the
world
rim
to
think
it
cost
some
courage
and
to
go
try
it
it
takes
every
power
you
know
it
takes
great
love
to
stir
the
human
heart
to
live
beyond
the
others
and
apart
a
love
that
is
not
shallow
is
not
small
is
not
for
one
or
two
but
for
them
all
love
that
can
wound
love
for
its
higher
need
love
that
can
leave

though
the
heart
may
bleed
love
that
can
lose

yet
steadfastly
live
loving
to
the

unconquered
out
of

that
covers

black
as

i
thank
whatever

may

for
my

soul
beyond
this

the
horror

not

william

religion

he
stood
before
the
sanhedrim
the
scowling
rabbis
gazed
at
him
he
recked
not
of
their
praise
or
blame
there
was
no
fear
there
was
no
shame
for
one
upon
whose
dazzled
eyes
the
whole
world
poured
its
vast
surprise
the
open
heaven
was
far
too
near
his
first
day
light
too
sweet
and
clear
to
let
him
waste
his
ken
on
the
face
of
men
but
still
they
questioned
who
art
thou
what
hast
thou
been
what
art
thou
now
thou
art
not
he
who
yesterday
sat
here
and
begged
beside
the
way
for
he
was
blind
i
am
he
for
i
was
blind
but
now
i
he
told
the
story
and
it
was
his
full
heart
only
lore
a
prophet
on
the
sabbath
day
had
touched
his
sightless
eyes
with
clay
and
made
him
see
who
had
been
blind
their
words
passed
by
him
like
the
wind
which
raves
and
howls
but
can
not
shock
the
rock
their
threats
and
fury
all
went
wide
they
could
not
touch
his
hebrew
pride
their
sneers
at
jesus
and
his
band
nameless
and
homeless
in
the
land
their
boasts
of
moses
and
his
lord
all
could
not
change
him
by
one
word
know
not
what
this
man
may
be
sinner
or
saint
but
as
for
me
one
thing
i
know
that
i
am
he
who
once
was
blind
and
now
i
they
were
all
doctors
of
renown
the
great
men
of
a
famous
town
with
deep
brows
wrinkled
broad
and
wise
beneath
their
wide
phylacteries
the
wisdom
of
the
east
was
theirs
and
honor
crowned
their
silvery
hairs
the
man
they
jeered
and
laughed
to
scorn
was
unlearned
poor
and
humbly
born
but
he
knew
better
far
than
they
what
came
to
him
that
sabbath
day
and
what
the
christ
had
done
for
him
he
knew
and
not
the
sanhedrim
john
hay
the
old
stoic
riches
i
hold
in
light
esteem
and
love
i
laugh
to
scorn
and
lust
of
fame
was
but
a
dream
that
vanished
with
the
morn
and
if
i
pray
the
only
prayer
that
moves
my
lips
for
me
is
leave
the
heart
that
now
i
bear
and
give
me
liberty
yes
as
my
swift
days
near
their
goal
is
all
that
i
implore
in
life
and
death
a
chainless
soul
and
courage
to
endure

to

for

bear
no

than

care
to
write
no

in

for
men
to
read
it
there
the
daily
cross
to
clasp

with

from

that
not

you

twin

hear
of

yield
them
reverence
due

sufferings
are
far
more
fit
for
you
to
own
no

to
which
is
prone
unnoticed
by
all
other
eyes
unworthy
in
your
own
to
yield
with
such
a
happy
art
that
no
one
thinks
you
care
and
say
to
your
poor
bleeding
heart
how
little
you
can
bear
o
is
a
pathway
hard
to
choose
a
struggle
hard
to
share
for

pride
would
still
refuse
the

there

yet
he
who

i
think
i
hold
more
generous
still
i
bow
before
the
noble
mind
that
freely
some
great

forgives
yet
nobler
is
the
one
forgiven
who
bears
that
burden
well
and
lives
it
may
be
hard
to
gain
and
still
to
keep
a
lowly

heart
yet
he
who
loses
has
to
fill
a
harder
and
a

part

it
is
to
wear
the
crown
of
a

who
knows
how

is

he

can
command

rule
with

is

who
can

who

aforetime
in

inglorious
sleep

i
felt
it
not

not

stupendous
was
the
meaning
that
it
bore
in

subtle
sense
of
being
newly

vein

electric
pleasure
half
allied

is
so
sweet
and
yet
so
awful
so
bewildering
yet
brave
to
be
king
in
every
conflict
where
before
i
crouched
a
slave
is
so
glorious
to
be
conscious
of
a
growing
power
within
stronger
than
the
rallying
forces
of
a
charged
and
marshaled
sin
never
in

old
romances
felt
i
half
the
thrill
of
life
that
i
feel
within

stirring
standing
in

place
of
strife
o
those
olden
days
of
dalliance
when
i

with

up
and
grew
into
a
tree
love
sought
its
shade
at
evening

to
breathe
its

a

scooped
a
well
where

walled
it
in

hung
with

ladle
at

he

judged
that

cooled
ten

fancy

strong
in
being

it
shone
upon

its
light
became
a

of

in

quenched
by

that
watched
to
ease
the
burden
of
the
world
laboriously
tracing
what
must
be
and
what
may
yet
be
better
saw
within
a

and
shaped
it
forth

the

divinely

raising

so
to
higher
reverence

that

fold
its

and
the

be
gathered

unread
forever
this
is

to

which
martyred

if

we
eased
no

if
through

all
we
nothing
done

that
brought
the

to

no
act
most

winter
if
no
kindly
thought
or
word
we
can
give
some
soul
to
bless
if
our
hands
from
hour
to
hour
do
no
deeds
of
gentleness
if
to
lone
and
weary
ones
we
no
comfort
will
impart
tho
is
summer
in
the
sky
yet
is
winter
in
the
heart
if
we
strive
to
lift
the
gloom
from
a
dark
and
burdened
life
if
we
seek
to
lull
the
storm
of
our
fallen
brother
strife
if
we
bid
all
hate
and
scorn
from
the
spirit
to
depart
tho
is
winter
in
the
sky
yet
is
summer
in
the
heart
the
laborer
idlers
all
day
about
the
they
name
us
and
our
dumb
lips
answer
not
bearing
the
bitter
while
our
sloth
disgrace
and
our
dark
tasking
whereof
none
may
wot
oh
the
fair
slopes
where
the
go
not
they
the
day
fierce
heat
and
burden
bear
but
we
who
on
the
drop
slow
our
barren
tears
while
all
the
bright
hours
wear
lord
of
the
vineyard
whose
dear
word
declares
our
one
hour
labor
as
the
day
shall
be
what
coin
divine
can
make
our
wage
as
theirs
who
had
the
morning
joy
of
work
for
thee
gray
noble
thy
labor
is
not
in
vain
i
have
labored
in
vain
a
preacher
said
and
his
brow
was
marked
with
care
i
have
labored
in
vain
he
bowed
down
his
head
and
bitter
and
sad
were
the
tears
he
shed
in
that
moment
of
dark
despair
i
am
weary
and
worn
and
my
hands
are
weak
and
my
courage
is
gone
for
none
give
heed
to
the
words
i
speak
and
in
vain
for
a
promise
of
fruit
i
seek
where
the
seed
of
the
word
is
sown
and
again
with
a
sorrowful
heart
he
wept
for
his
spirit
with
grief
was
stirred
till
the
night
grew
dark
and
at
last
he
slept
and
a
silent
calm
his
spirit
crept
and
a
whisper
of
peace
was
heard
and
he
thought
in
his
dream
that
his
soul
took
flight
to
a
blessed
and
bright
abode
he
saw
a
throne
of
dazzling
light
and
harps
were
ringing
and
robes
were
white
made
white
in
a
saviour
blood
and
he
saw
such
a
countless
throng
around
as
he
never
had
seen
before
their
brows
with
jewels
of
light
were
crowned
and
sorrow
and
sighing
no
place
had
found
the
troubles
of
time
were
then
a
maiden
came
forth
and
said
joy
joy
for
the
trials
are
passed
i
am
one
that
thy
gentle
words
have
led
in
the
narrow
pathway
of
life
to
tread
i
welcome
thee
home
at
last
and
the
preacher
gazed
on
the
maiden
face
he
had
seen
that
face
on
earth
where
with
anxious
heart
in
his
wonted
place
he
had
told
his
charge
of
a
saviour
grace
and
their
need
of
a
second
birth
then
the
preacher
smiled
and
the
angel
said
go
forth
to
thy
work
again
it
is
not
in
vain
that
the
seed
is
shed
if
only
one
soul
to
the
cross
is
led
thy
labor
is
not
in
vain
and
at
last
he
woke
and
his
knee
he
bent
in
grateful
childlike
prayer
and
he
prayed
till
an
answer
of
peace
was
sent
and
faith
and
hope
as
a
rainbow
bent
the
clouds
of
his
earthly
care
and
he
rose
in
joy
and
his
eye
was
bright
his
sorrow
and
grief
had
fled
and
his
soul
was
calm
and
his
heart
was
light
for
his
hands
were
strong
in
his
saviour
might
as
forth
to
his
work
he
sped
whatever
dies
or
is
forgot
work
done
for
god
it
dieth
not
following
the
master
i
asked
the
lord
that
i
might
worthier
be
might
grow
in
faith
and
hope
and
charity
and
straight
go
feed
my
lambs
he
answered
me
nay
lord
i
cried
can
outward
deeds
avail
to
cleanse
my
spirit
heart
and
courage
fail
and
sins
prevent
and
foes
and
fears
assail
and
still
go
feed
my
lambs
was
all
i
heard
but
should
i
rest
upon
that
simple
word
was
that
indeed
my
message
from
my
lord
behold
i
thought
that
he
his
hand
would
lay
on
my
sick
soul
and
words
of
healing
say
and
charm
the
from
my
heart
away
half
wroth
i
turned
to
go
but
oh
the
look
he
on
me
cast
a
gaze
i
could
not
brook
with
deep
relentings
all
my
spirit
shook
o
dearest
lord
i
cried
i
will
obey
say
what
thou
wilt
only
lead
thou
the
way
for
following
thee
my
footsteps
shall
not
stray
he
took
me
at
my
word
he
went
before
he
led
me
to
the
dwellings
of
the
poor
where
want
keeps
watch
beside
the
door
he
beckoned
me
and
i
essayed
to
go
where
sin
and
crime
more
sad
than
want
and
woe
hold
carnival
and
vice
walks
to
and
fro
and
when
i
faltered
at
the
sight
he
said
behold
i
died
for
such
these
hands
have
bled
this
side
for
such
has
pierced
been
he
said
is
the
disciple
greater
than
his
lord
the
servant
than
his
master
oh
that
word
it
smote
me
like
a
sharp
sword
and
since
that
hour
if
any
work
of
mine
has
been
accepted
by
my
lord
as
sign
that
i
was
following
in
his
steps
divine
if
serving
others
though
imperfectly
my
own
poor
life
has
worthier
come
to
be
and
i
have
grown
in
faith
and
charity
dear
lord
be
thine
the
glory
thou
hast
wrought
all
unaware
the
blessing
that
i
sought
o
that
these
lips
might
praise
thee
as
they
ought
be
always
giving
the
sun
gives
ever
so
the
earth
what
it
can
give
so
much
is
worth
the
ocean
gives
in
many
ways
gives
baths
gives
fishes
rivers
bays
so
too
the
air
it
gives
us
breath
when
it
stops
giving
comes
in
death

the

god
love

in
us
wealth
unheaped
only
by

it

slightest
actions
often

the
sorest
needs
for
the
world
wants
daily
little
kindly
deeds
o
what
care
and
sorrow
you
may
help
remove
with
your
song
and
courage
sympathy
and
love
not
lost
the
look
of
sympathy
the
gentle
word
spoken
so
low
that
only
angels
heard
the
secret
act
of
pure
unseen
by
men
but
marked
by
angels
eyes
these
are
not
lost
the
silent
tears
that
fall
at
dead
of
night
over
soiled
robes
that
once
were
pure
and
white
the
prayers
that
rise
like
incense
from
the
soul
longing
for
christ
to
make
it
clean
and
whole
these
are
not
lost
the
happy
dreams
that
gladdened
all
our
youth
when
dreams
had
less
of
self
and
more
of
truth
the
childhood
faith
so
tranquil
and
so
sweet
which
sat
like
mary
at
the
master
feet
these
are
not
lost
the
kindly
plans
devised
for
others
good
so
seldom
guessed
so
little
understood
the
quiet
steadfast
love
that
strove
to
win
some
wanderer
from
the
ways
of
sin
these
are
not
lost
not
lost
o
lord
for
in
thy
city
bright
our
eyes
shall
see
the
past
by
clearer
light
and
things
long
hidden
from
our
gaze
below
thou
wilt
reveal
and
we
shall
surely
know
they
were
not
lost
there
never
a
rose
in
all
the
world
but
makes
some
green
spray
sweeter
there
never
a
wind
in
all
the
sky
but
makes
some
bird
wing
fleeter
there
never
a
star
but
brings
to
heaven
some
silver
radiance
tender
and
never
a
rosy
cloud
but
helps
to
crown
the
sunset
splendor
no
robin
but
may
thrill
some
heart
his
dawn
like
gladness
voicing
god
gives
us
all
some
small
sweet
way
to
set
the
world
rejoicing
a
broader
field
o
thou
who
sighest
for
a
broader
field
wherein
to
sow
the
seeds
of
truth
and
right
who
fain
a
fuller
nobler
power
would
wield
human
souls
that
languish
for
the
light
search
well
the
realm
that
even
now
is
thine
canst
not
thou
in
some
corner
find
a
heart
like
tree
with
sapping
vine
waiting
for
help
its
burdens
to
unbind
some
human
plant
perchance
beneath
thine
eyes
pierced
through
with
hidden
thorns
of
idle
fears
or
drooping
low
for
need
of
light
from
skies
obscured
by
raining
poison
tears
some

soul
the
balm
of
love
would
heal
some
timid

thy

we

to

still
in

for

christians
only
really
live
not
in
having
or
receiving
but
in
giving
there
is
bliss
he
who
has
no
other
pleasure
ever
may
rejoice
in
this
what
christ
said
i
said
let
me
walk
in
the
fields
he
said
no
walk
in
the
town
i
said
there
are
no
flowers
there
he
said
no
flowers
but
a
crown
i
said
but
the
skies
are
black
there
is
nothing
but
noise
and
din
and
he
wept
as
he
sent
me
back
there
is
more
he
said
there
is
sin
i
said
but
the
air
is
thick
and
fogs
are
veiling
the
sun
he
answered
yet
souls
are
sick
and
souls
in
the
dark
undone
i
said
i
shall
miss
the
light
and
friends
will
miss
me
they
say
he
answered
choose
if
am
to
miss
you
or
they
i
pleaded
for
time
to
be
given
he
said
is
it
hard
to
decide
it
will
not
seem
hard
in
heaven
to
have
followed
the
steps
of
your
guide
i
cast
one
look
at
the
fields
then
set
my
face
to
the
town
he
said
my
child
do
you
yield
will
you
leave
the
flowers
for
the
crown
then
into
his
hand
went
mine
and
into
my
heart
came
he
and
i
walk
in
a
light
divine
the
path
i
had
feared
to
see
george
macdonald
my
service
i
asked
the
lord
to
let
me
do
some
mighty
work
for
him
to
fight
amid
his
battle
hosts
then
sing
the
victor
hymn
i
longed
my
ardent
love
to
show
but
jesus
would
not
have
it
so
he
placed
me
in
a
quiet
home
whose
life
was
calm
and
still
and
gave
me
little
things
to
do
my
daily
round
to
fill
i
could
not
think
it
good
to
be
just
put
aside
so
silently
small
duties
gathered
round
my
way
they
seemed
of
earth
alone
i
who
had
longed
for
conquests
bright
to
lay
before
his
throne
had
common
things
to
do
and
bear
to
watch
and
strive
with
daily
care
so
then
i
thought
my
prayer
unheard
and
asked
the
lord
once
more
that
he
would
give
me
work
for
him
and
open
wide
the
door
forgetting
that
my
master
knew
just
what
was
best
for
me
to
do
then
quietly
the
answer
came
my
child
i
hear
thy
cry
think
not
that
mighty
deeds
alone
will
bring
the
victory
the
battle
has
been
planned
by
me
let
daily
life
thy
conquests
see
pass
it
on
have
you
had
a
kindness
shown
pass
it
on
it
was
not
given
to
you
alone
pass
it
on
let
it
travel
through
the
years
let
it
wipe
another
tears
till
in
heaven
the
deed
appears
pass
it
on
have
you
found
the
heavenly
light
pass
it
on
souls
are
groping
in
the
night
daylight
gone
lift
your
lighted
lamp
on
high
be
a
star
in
some
one
sky
he
may
live
who
else
would
die
pass
it
on
giving
and
taking
who
gives
and
hides
the
giving
hand
nor
counts
on
favor
fame
or
praise
shall
find
his
smallest
gift
outweighs
the
burden
of
the
sea
and
land
who
gives
to
whom
hath
naught
been
given
his
gift
in
need
though
small

the
faithful
monk
golden
gleams
of
noonday
fell
on
the
pavement
of
the
cell
and
the
monk
still
lingered
there
in
the
ecstasy
of
prayer
fuller
floods
of
glory
streamed
through
the
window
and
it
seemed
like
an
answering
glow
of
love
from
the
countenance
above
on
the
silence
of
the
cell
break
the
faint
tones
of
a
bell
is
the
hour
when
at
the
gate
crowds
of
poor
and
hungry
wait
wan
and
wistful
to
be
fed
with
the
friar
of
mercy
bread
hark
that
chime
of
heaven
far
bells
on
the
monk
rapt
ear
it
swells
no
fond
flattering
dream
away
mercy
calls
no
longer
stay
whom
thou
yearnest
here
to
find
in
the
musings
of
thy
mind
god
and
jesus
lo
they
wait
knocking
at
thy
convent
gate
from
his
knees
the
monk
arose
with
full
heart
and
hand
he
goes
at
his
gate
the
poor
relieves
gains
a
blessing
and
receives
to
his
cell
returned
and
there
found
the
angel
of
his
prayer
who
with
radiant
features
said
hadst
thou
stayed
i
must
have
fled
charles
timothy
brooks
the
heavenly
presence
somewhere
i
have
read
of
an
aged
monk
who
kneeling
one
day
in
his
cell
beheld
in
a
glorious
vision
the
form
of
the
dear
lord
christ
and
there
fell
upon
him
a
rapture
wondrously
sweet
and
his
lips
could
frame
no
word
as
he
gazed
on
the
form
and
noted
the
love
that
beamed
from
the
face
of
his
lord
there
came
to
his
ears
the
sound
of
a
bell
which
called
him
early
and
late
to
carry
loaves
to
the
wretched
poor
who
lingered
about
the
gate
could
he
leave
his
cell
now
glorified
by
the
presence
of
the
christ
the
blessed
son
the
holy
one
his
saviour
the
sacrificed
he
went
to
his
act
of
mercy
and
when
he
returned
to
his
cell
the
dim
gay
light
was
dispelled
as
the
loving
christ
to
welcome
him
and
the
blessed
one
remained
more
fair
more
glorious
than
before
and
the
heart
of
the
aged
monk
was
glad
and
his
cell
was
dim
no
more
draw
nigh
and
abide
with
me
o
christ
all
through
this
day
is
the
prayer
which
sounds
from
my
heart
and
my
lips
repeat
each
morning
and
christ
the
fair
seems
very
near
as
his
words
i
hear
though
his
form
i
do
not
see
when
you
care
for
the
least
of
these
dear
child
you
have
done
it
unto
me
with
loving
service
fill
all
this
day

and
i
will
be
near
your
heart

only
it
was
a
blossom
just
the
merest
bit
of
bloom
but
it
brought
a
glimpse
of
summer
to
the
little
darkened
room
it
was
a
glad
good
morning
as
she
passed
along
the
way
but
it
spread
the
morning
glory
over
the
livelong
day
a
song
but
the
music
though
simply
pure
and
sweet
brought
back
to
better
pathways
the
reckless
roving
feet
in
our
blind
wisdom
how
dare
we
say
at
all
since
the
ages
alone
can
tell
us
which
is
the
great
or
small
something
you
can
do
hark
the
voice
of
jesus
calling
who
will
go
and
work

will
bear
the
sheaves
away

you
can
find

nearer
you
can
help
them
at
your
door
if
you
can
not
give
your
thousands
you
can
give
the
widow
mite
and
the
least
you
give
for
jesus
will
be
precious
in
his
sight
if
you
can
not
speak
like
angels
if
you
can
not
preach
like
paul
you
can
tell
the
love
of
jesus
you
can
say
he
died
for
all
if
you
can
not
rouse
the
wicked
with
the
judgment
dread
alarms
you
can
lead
the

no

in
itself
is
small
none
great
though
earth
it
fill
but
that
is
small
that
seeks
its
own
and
great
that
seeks
god
will
then
hold
my
hand
most
gracious
god
guide
all
my
goings
still
and
let
it
be
my
life
one
aim
to
know
and
do
thy
will
easily
given
it
was
only
a
sunny
smile
and
little
it
cost
in
the
giving
but
it
scattered
the
night
like
morning
light
and
made
the
day
worth
living
through
life
dull
warp
a
woof
it
wove
in
shining
colors
of
light
and
love
and
the
angels
smiled
as
they
watched
above
yet
little
it
cost
in
giving
it
was
only
a
kindly
word
and
a
word
that
was
lightly
spoken
yet
not
in
vain
for
it
stilled
the
pain
of
a
heart
that
was
nearly
broken
it
strengthened
a
fate
beset
by
fears
and
groping
blindly
through
mists
of
tears
for
light
to
brighten
the
coming
years
although
it
was
lightly
spoken
it
was
only
a
helping
hand
and
it
seemed
of
little
availing
but
its
clasps
were
warm
and
it
saved
from
harm
a
brother
whose
strength
was
failing
its
touch
was
tender
as
angels
wings
but
it
rolled
the
stone
from
the
hidden
springs
and
pointed
the
way
to
higher
things
though
it
seemed
of
little
availing
a
smile
a
word
a
touch
and
each
is
easily
given
yet
one
may
win
a
soul
from
sin
or
smooth
the
way
to
heaven
a
smile
may
lighten
a
falling
heart
a
word
may
soften
pain
keenest
smart
a
touch
may
lead
us
from
sin
apart
how
easily
each
is
given
working
with
christ
o
matchless
honor
all
unsought
high
privilege

though
the

strive

they
knew

how
oft

if

before
they
laid
it
in
its
and
deem
that
death
had
left
it
almost
fair
and
laying
flowers
upon
my
hair
would
smooth
it
down
with
tearful
tenderness
and
fold
my
hands
with
lingering
caress
poor
hands
so
empty
and
so
cold
if

call

deed
the
icy

had
wrought

lips
had
said
errands
on
which
the
willing
feet
had
sped
the
memory
of
my
selfishness
and
pride
my
hasty
words
would
all
be
put
aside
and
so
i
should
be
loved
and
mourned
if
i
should
die
even
hearts
estranged
would
turn
once
more
to
me
recalling
other
days
remorsefully
the
eyes
that
chill
me
with
averted
glance
would
look
upon
me
as
of
yore
perchance
and
soften
in
the
old
familiar
way
for
who
would
war
with
dumb
unconscious
clay
so
i
might
rest
forgiven
of
all
o

keep
not
your

his

then
we
fold
our

say
the
world
is
vulgar
didst
thou
turn
away
o
sacred
spirit
delicately
wrought
because
the

souls
of
galilee
were
tuned
not
to
the

chimed
not

how
doth
death
speak
of
our
beloved
when
it
has
laid
them
low
when
it
has
set
its
hallowing
touch
on
speechless
lip
and
brow
it
clothes
their
every
gift
and
grace
with
radiance
from
the
holiest
place
with
light
as
from
an
angel
face
recalling
with
resistless
force
and
tracing
to
their
hidden
source
deeds
scarcely
noticed
in
their
course
this
little
loving
fond
device
that
daily
act
of
sacrifice
of
which
too
late
we
learned
the
price
opening
our
weeping
eyes
to
trace
simple
unnoticed
kindnesses
forgotten
tones
of
tenderness
which
evermore
to
us
must
be
sacred
as
hymns
in
infancy
learnt
listening
at
a
mother
knee
thus
doth
death
speak
of
our
beloved
when
it
has
laid
them
low
then
let
love
antedate
the
work
of
death
and
speak
thus
now
how
does
death
speak
of
our
beloved
when
it
has
laid
them
low
when
it
has
set
its
hallowing
touch
on
speechless
lip
and
brow
it
sweeps
their
faults
with
heavy
hand
as
sweeps
the
sea
the
trampled
sand
till
scarce
the
faintest
print
is
scanned
it
shows
how
much
the
vexing
deed
was
but
a
generous
nature
weed
or
some
choice
virtue
run
to
seed
how
that
small
fretting
fretfulness
was
but
love
overanxiousness
which
had
not
been
had
love
been
less
this
failing
at
which
we
repined
but
the
dim
shade
of
day
declined
which
should
have
made
us
doubly
kind
it
takes
each
failing
on
our
part
and
brands
it
in
upon
the
heart
with
caustic
power
and
cruel
art
the
small
neglect
that
may
have
pained
a
giant
stature
will
have
gained
when
it
can
never
be
explained
the
little
service
which
had
proved
how
tenderly
we
watched
and
loved
and
those
mute
lips
to
smiles
had
moved
the
little
gift
from
out
our
store
which
might
have
cheered
some
cheerless
hour
when
they
with
earth
poor
needs
were
poor
it
shows
our
faults
like
fires
at
night
it
sweeps
their
failings
out
of

it

their
good
in
heavenly
light

looking

the

came
one
evening
to
the
gate
of
a
fair
city
it
was
growing
late
and
sending
his
disciples
to
buy
food
he
wandered
forth
intent
on
doing
good
as
was
his
wont
and
in
the
he
saw
a
crowd
close
gathered
in
one
space
gazing
with
eager
eyes
upon
the
ground
jesus
drew
nearer
and
thereon
he
found
a
noisome
creature
a
bedraggled
wreck
a
dead
dog
with
a
halter
round
his
neck
and
those
who
stood
by
mocked
the
object
there
and
one
said
scoffing
it
pollutes
the
air
another
jeering
asked
how
long
shall
such
a
miscreant
cur
offend
our
sight
look
at
his
torn
hide
sneered
a
jewish
wit
you
could
not
cut
even
a
shoe
from
it
and
turned
away
behold
his
ears
that
bleed

in
an
unclean

indeed
he
hath
been
hanged
for
thieving
they
all
cried
and
spurned
the
loathsome
beast
from
side
to
side
then
jesus
standing
by
them
in
the
street
looked
on
the
poor
spent
creature
at
his
feet
and
bending
him
spake
unto
the
men
are
not
whiter
than
his
and
then
the
people
at
each
other
gazed
asking
who
is
this
stranger
pitying
this
vile
thing
then
one
exclaimed
with
breath
this
surely
is
the
man
of
nazareth
this
must
be
jesus
for
none
else
but
he
something
to
praise
in
a
dead
dog
could
see
and
being
ashamed
each
scoffer
bowed
his
head
and
from
the
sight
of
jesus
turned
and
fled

frightful

i
might
share
a

load
along
the

i
should

day
how
could
i
dare

in

watch
i
kneel
to
pray
to
ask
for

to
bear

our

when

will
the
deep
desire
be
met

our
prayer
began
a
closer

with

will
mean
a

walk
with
man
if
any
little
word
of
mine
may
make
a
life
the
brighter
if
any
little
song
of
mine
may
make
a
heart
the
lighter
god
help
me
speak
the
little
word
and
take
my
bit
of
singing
and
drop
it
in
some
lonely
vale
to
set
the
echoes
ringing
if
any
little
love
of
mine
may
make
a
life
the
sweeter
if
any
little
care
of
mine
make
other
life
completer
if
any
lift
of
mine
may
ease
the
burden
of
another

give
me
love
and
care
and

outwearied
with
the
littleness
and

the

and
the

of

cried
give
me
but
justice
thinking
then
i
meekly
craved
a
common
boon
which
might
most
easily
be
granted
soon
the
light
of
deeper
truth
grew
on
my
wondering
ken
escaping
baneful
damps
of
stagnant

then
i
saw
that
in
my

bedight
i
claimed
from
erring
man
the
gift
of

own
great
vested
right
and
i
grew
calm
with
folded
hands
like
stone
to
patience
given
and
pitying
of
pure
love
distilling
balm
and
now
i
wait
in
quiet

to

it

hour
my

ask
naught

thine

the

the

sadness
friendship
is

not

our

the

pale
before
the

of
thy

thou

it
seems
to
be
a
sort
of
fairy
ground
where
suns
unsetting
light
the
sky
and
flowers
and
fruits
abound
but
when
thy
keener
purer
beam
is
poured
upon
our
sight
it
loses
all
its
power
to
charm
and
what
was
day
is
night
its
noblest
toils
are
then
the
scourge
which
made
thy
blood
to
flow
its
joys
are
but
the
treacherous
thorns
which
circled
round
thy
brow
and
thus
when
we
renounce
for
thee
its
restless
aims
and
fears
the
tender
memories
of
the
past
the
hopes
of
coming
years

hast
made
each
step
an
onward
one
and
we
will
ever
trust
each
unknown
morrow
thou
wilt
sustain
us
till
its
work
is
done
in
the
heart
depths
a
peace
serene
and
holy
abides
and
when
pain
seems
to
have
its
will
or
we
despair
o
may
that
peace
rise
slowly
stronger
than
agony
and
we
be
still
now
father
now
in
thy
dear
presence
kneeling
our
spirits
yearn
to
feel
thy
kindling
love
now
make
us
strong
we
need
thy
deep
revealing
of
trust
and
strength
and
calmness
from

samuel
johnson
when
i
am
weak
then
am
i
strong
half
feeling
our
own
weakness
we
place
our
hands
in
thine
knowing
but
half
our
darkness
we
ask
for
light
divine
then
when
thy
strong
arm
holds
us
our
weakness
most
we
feel
and
thy
love
and
light
around
us
our
darkness
must
reveal
too
oft
when
faithless
doubtings
around
our
spirits
press
we
cry
can
hands
so
feeble
grasp
such
almightiness
while
thus
we
doubt
and
tremble
our
hold
still
looser
grows
while
on
our
darkness
gazing
vainly
thy
radiance
glows
oh
cheer
us
with
thy
brightness
and
guide
us
by
thy
hand
in
thy
light
teach
us
light
to
see
in
thy
strength
strong
to
stand
then
though
our
hands
be
feeble
if
they
but
touch
thine
arm
thy
light
and
power
shall
lead
us
and
keep
us
strong
and
calm
a
humble
heart
i
would
not
ask
thee
that
my
days
should
flow
quite
smoothly
on
and
on
lest
i
should
learn
to
love
the
world
too
well
ere
all
my
time
was
done
i
would
not
ask
thee
that
my
work
should
never
bring
me
pain
nor
fear
lest
i
should
learn
to
work
alone
and
never
wish
thy
presence
near
i
would
not
ask
thee
that
my
friends
should
always
kind
and
constant
be
lest
i
should
learn
to
lay
my
faith
in
them
alone
and
not
in
thee
but
i
would
ask
a
humble
heart
a
changeless
will
to
work
and
wake
a
firm
faith
in
thy
providence

the

of

and
still
he
asks
his

to
lay
their

hopes
and

at

he
not
forget
the
feeblest

humblest

he
only
asks
that
of

we
give
to
him
the
best
we
have
praise
deprecated
my
sins
and
follies
lord
by
thee
from
others
hidden
are
that
such
good
words
are
spoke
of
me
as
now
and
then
i
hear
for
sure
if
others
know
me
such
such
as
myself
i
know
i
should
have
been
dispraised
as
much
as
i
am
prais√®d
now
the
praise
therefore
which
i
have
heard
delights
not
so
my
mind
as
those
things
make
my
heart
afeard
which
in
myself
i
find
and
i
had
rather
to
be
blamed
so
i
were
blameless
made
than
for
much
virtue
to
be
famed
when
i
no
virtues
had
though
slanders
to
an
innocent
sometimes
do
bitter
grow
their
bitterness
procures
content
if
clear
himself
he
know
and
when
a
virtuous
man
hath
erred
if
praised
himself
he
hear
it
makes
him
grieve
and
more
afeard
than
if
he
slandered
were
lord
therefore
make
my
heart
upright
my
deeds
do
seem
and
righteous
rather
in
thy
sight
than
in
the
world
esteem
and
if
aught
good
appears
to
be
in
any
act
of
mine
let
thankfulness
be
found
in
me
and
all
the
praise
be
thine

up

away
like
the

that
soars
from

earth
to

in

so
let
me
steal
away
gently
and
lovingly
only
remembered
by
what
i
have
done
my

and
my
place
and
my

all
forgotten
the
brief
race
of
time
well
and
patiently
run
so
let
me
pass
away
peacefully
silently
only
remembered
by
what
i
have
done
gladly
away
from
this
toil
would
i
hasten
up
to
the
crown
that
for
me
has
been
won
unthought
of
by
man
in
rewards
or
in
praises
only
remembered
by
what
i
have
done
up
and
away
like
the
odors
of
sunset
that
sweeten
the
twilight
as
evening
comes
on
so
be
my
life
a
thing
felt
but
not
noticed
and
i
but
remembered
by
what
i
have
done
yes
like
the
fragrance
that
wanders
in
freshness
when
the
flowers
that
it
came
from
are
closed
up
and
gone
so
would
i
be
to
this
world
weary
dwellers
only
remembered
by
what
i
have
done
i
need
not
be
missed
if
my
life
has
been
bearing
as
its
summer
and
autumn
move
silently
on
the
bloom
and
the
fruit
and
the
seed
of
its
season
i
shall
still
be
remembered
by
what
i
have
done
needs
there
the
praise
of
the
record
the
name
and
the
epitaph
graved
on
the
stone
the
things
we
have
lived
for
let
them
be
our
story
we
ourselves
but
remembered
by
what
we
have
done
i
need
not
be
missed
if
another
succeed
me
to
reap
down
the
fields
which
in
spring
i
have
sown
he
who
plowed
and
who
sowed
is
not
missed
by
the
reaper
he
is
only
remembered
by
what
he
has
done
not
myself
but
the
truth
that
in
life
i
have
spoken
not
myself
but
the
seed
that
in
life
i
have
sown
shall
pass
on
to
ages
all
about
me
forgotten
save
the
truth
i
have
spoken
the
things
i
have
done
so
let
my
living
be
so
be
my
dying
so
let
my
name
lie
unblazoned
unknown
unpraised
and
unmissed
i
shall
still
be
remembered
yes
but
remembered
for
what
i
have

the

come
the
last
and
saddest
of

eves
worn
out
with
labor
long
and
wearisome
drooping
and
faint
the
reapers
hasten
home
each
laden
with
his
sheaves
last
of
the

thy

i
gain
lord
of
the
harvest
and
my
spirit
grieves
that
i
am
burdened
not
so
much
with
grain
as
with
a
heaviness
of
heart
and
brain
master
behold
my
sheaves
few
light
and
worthless
yet
their
trifling
weight
through
all
my
frame
a
weary
aching
leaves
for
long
i
struggled
with
my
hapless
fate
and
stayed
and
toiled
till
it
was
dark
and
late
yet
these
are
all
my
sheaves
full
well
i
know
i
have
more
tares
than
wheat
brambles
and
flowers
dry
stalks
and
withered
leaves
wherefore
i
blush
and
weep
as
at
thy
feet
i
kneel
down
reverently
and
repeat
master
behold
my
sheaves
i
know
these
blossoms
clustering
heavily
with
evening
dew
upon
their
folded
leaves
can
claim
no
value
or
utility
therefore
shall
fragrancy
and
beauty
be
the
glory
of
my
sheaves
so
do
i
gather
strength
and
hope
anew
for
well
i
know
thy
patient
love
perceives
not
what
i
did
but
what
i
strove
to
do
and
though
the
full
ripe
ears
be
sadly
few
thou
wilt
accept
my
sheaves
elizabeth

i
pray
not

there
is

a

that
leans
on
thee
is
happy
everywhere
in
a
service
which
thy

appoints
there
are
no

for

for
my
secret
heart

learned
the

which
makes
thy
children
free
and
a
life
of

is
a
life
of

the
time
of
asking
so
urgent
was
your

to
make
it
known

years
have
passed
since
then
do
not
despair
the

will
answer
you
sometime

unanswered

not

ungranted
perhaps
your
work
is
not

wholly
done
the
work
began
when

your

was

will
finish
what

the
homely
words
how
often
read
how
seldom
fully
known
which
father
of
you
asked
for
bread
would
give
his
son
a
stone
how
oft
has
bitter
tear
been
shed
and
heaved
how
many
a
groan
because
thou
wouldst
not
give
for
bread
the
thing
that
was
a
stone
how
oft
the
child
thou
wouldst
have
fed
thy
gift
away
has
thrown
he
prayed
thou
heardst
and
gavest
bread
he
cried
it
is

my

he
well
knowing
all

kindly
rebukes
my

greed
and
granting

me
instead
to
do
some
task
some
lowly
task
for

of
him
so
lowly
and
in

so

my

soul
must
cease
to
sing
and
only
sigh
is
for
the

and
scarcely
can
my

repeat
her
sad
petition
at
his
feet
these
daily
tasks

to
me

to
do
as
unto
thee

while
his

thus
i
do
i
know
not
how
or
why
is
true
my
thoughts
to

contentment
glide
and
i
forget
the
wish
denied
and
so
my
prayers
he
hears
and
heeds
mindful
of
all
my
daily
needs

most
gracious
too

a
prayer

this
the
blessing
i
must
miss

if
i
only
dare
to
raise
this

prayer
thou
seest
lord
that
i
am
poor
and
weak
and
can
not
tell
what
things
i
ought
to
seek
i
therefore
do
not
ask
at
all
but
still
i
trust
thy
bounty
all
my
wants
to
fill
my
lips
shall
thus
grow
dumb
the
blessing
shall
not
come
but
if
i
lowly
fall
and
thus
in
faith
i
call
through
christ
o
lord
i
pray
thee
give
to
me
not
what
i
would
but
what
seems
best
to
thee
of
life
of
health
of
service
and
of
strength

i
come

the

there
is
an
arm
that
never
tires
when
human
strength
gives
way

is
a
love
that
never
fails
when
earthly
loves
decay
that
eye
is
fixed
on

that
arm
upholds
the

that
ear
is
filled
with

songs
that
love
is
throned
on

there
a
power
which
man
can
wield
when
mortal
aid
is
vain
that
eye
that
arm
that
love
to
reach
that
listening
ear
to
gain
that
power
is

washington
gladden
there
was
a
man
who
prayed
for
wisdom
that
he
might
sway
men
from
sinful
ways
and
lead
them
into
light
each
night
he
knelt
and
asked
the
lord
to
let
him
guide
the
sinful
horde
and
every
day
he
rose
again
to
idly
drift
along
one
of
the
many
common
men
who
form
the
common
throng
granted
or
denied
to
long
with
all
our
longing
powers
and
have
the
wish
denied
to
urge
and
strain
our
force
in
vain
against
the
unresting
tide
of
fate
and
circumstance
which
still
baffles
and
beats
and
thwarts
our
will
to
reach
the
goal
toward
which
we
strove
all
the
long
way
and
hard
to
win
the
prize
which
to
our
eyes
seemed
life
one
best
reward

and
then
to

all
empty
made
to

in
each
sweet
thing
to
watch

fade
the
fruit
to
ashes
turn
the
gold
to
worthless
dross
within
our
hold
now
which
has
most
of
grief
and
pain
which
is
the
worse
to
bear
the
joy
we
crave
and
never
have

the

of
the
granted

baffled

you

not

john

the
valley
of
silence
i
walk
down
the
valley
of
silence
down
the
dim
voiceless
valley
alone
and
i
hear
not
the
fall
of
a
footstep
around
me
save
god
and
my
own
and
the
hush
of
my
heart
is
as
holy
as
hovers
where
angels
have
flown
long
ago
was
i
weary
of
voices
whose
music
my
heart
could
not
win
long
ago
was
i
weary
of
noises
that
fretted
my
soul
with
their
din
long
ago
was
i
weary
of
places
where
i
met
but
the
human
and
sin
and
still
did
i
pine
for
the
perfect
and
still
found
the
false
with
the
true
i
sought
the
human
for
heaven
but
caught
a
mere
glimpse
of
the
blue
and
i
wept
when
the
clouds
of
the
world
veiled
even
glimpse
from
my
view
and
i
toiled
on
of
the
human
and
i
moaned
the
mazes
of
men
till
i
knelt
long
ago
at
an
altar
and
heard
a
voice
call
me
since
then
i
walk
down
the
valley
of
silence
that
lies
far
beyond
mortal
ken
do
you
ask
what
i
found
in
the
valley
is
my
trysting
place
with
the
divine
when
i
fell
at
the
feet
of
the
holy
and
about
me
a
voice
said
be
mine
there
arose
from
the
depths
of
my
spirit
an
echo
my
heart
shall
be
thine
do
you
ask
how
i
live
in
the
valley
i
weep
and
i
dream
and
i
pray
but
my
tears
are
as
sweet
as
the
that
fall
on
the
roses
in
may
and
my
prayer
like
a
perfume
from
censer
ascendeth
to
god
night
and
day
in
the
hush
of
the
valley
of
silence
i
dream
all
the
songs
that
i
sing
and
the
music
floats
down
the
dim
valley
till
each
finds
a
word
for
a
wing
that
to
men
like
the
doves
of
the
deluge
the
message
of
peace
they
may
bring
but
far
out
on
the
deep
there
are
billows
that
never
shall
break
on
the
beach
and
i
have
heard
songs
in
the
silence
that
never
shall
float
into
speech
and
i
have
had
dreams
in
the
valley
too
lofty
for
language
to
reach
and
i
have
seen
thoughts
in
the
valley
ah
me
how
my
spirit
was
stirred
and
they
wear
holy
veils
on
their
faces
their
footsteps
can
scarcely
be
heard
they
pass
through
the
valley
like
virgins
too
pure
for
the
touch
of
a
word
do
you
ask
me
the
place
of
the
valley
ye
hearts
that
are
harrowed
by
care
it
lieth
afar
between
mountains
and
god
and
his
angels
are
there
and
one
is

dark
mount
of
sorrow
the
other

sat
by

place
reading
a
book
with
a
pleasant
face
till
a
child
came
up
with
a
childish
frown
and
pushed
the
book
saying
put
it
down
then
the
mother
slapping
his
curly
head
said
troublesome
child
go
off
to
bed
a
great
deal
of
christ
life
i
must
know
to
train
you
up
as
a
child
should
go
and
the
child
went
off
to
bed
to
cry
and
denounce
religion
by
and
by
another
woman
bent
over
a
book
with
a
smile
of
joy
and
an
intent
look
till
a
child
came
up
and
jogged
her
knee
and
said
of
the
book
put
it
down
take
me
then
the
mother
sighed
as
she
stroked
his
head
saying
softly
i
never
shall
get
it
read
but
i
try
by
loving
to
learn
his
will
and
his
love
into
my
child
instill
that
child
went
to
bed
without
a
sigh
and
will
love
religion
by
and
by
a
life
hid
with

i
have
a
life
with

to
live
but
ere
i
live
it
must
i
wait
till
learning
can
clear
answer
give
of
this
or
that
book
date
i
have
a
life
in

to
live
i
have
a
death
in

must
i

till

give

doubts
a
full

nay
rather
while
the
sea
of
doubt
is
raging
wildly
round
about
questioning
of

and

and

let
me
but
creep
within
thy
fold
o

at

take

the

seat
and

smiled

smiled
he
smiled
because
the
sky
was
high
above
his
head
because
the
rose
was
red
because
the
past
was
dead
he
never
wondered
why
the

had
blundered
so
that
all
things
have
to
go
the
wrong
way
here
below
the
overarching

he
toiled
and
still
was
glad
because
the

was
free
because
he
loved
and

that
claimed
his
love
and
he
shared
all
the
joys
they
had
because
the
grasses
grew
because
the
sweet
winds
blew
because
that
he
could
hew
and
hammer
he
was
glad
because
he
lived
he
smiled
and
did
not
look
ahead
with
bitterness
or
dread
but
nightly
sought
his
bed
as
calmly
as
a
child
and
people
called
him
mad
for
being
always
glad
with
such
things
as
he
had
and
shook
their
heads
and
smiled

the

the

round
of

hour
by

its
tedious
iteration

every

how
we

great

dearly

the
common

such
as
men
give
and
take
from

to

comes
in
the
common
walk
of

blown
by
the
careless

across

great
truths
are
greatly
won
not
found
by
chance
nor
wafted
on
the
breath
of
summer
dream
but
grasped
in
the
great
struggle
of
the
soul
hard
buffeting
with
adverse
wind
and
stream
but
in
the
day
of
conflict
fear
and
grief
when
the
strong
hand
of
god
put
forth
in
might
plows
up
the
subsoil
of
the
stagnant
heart
and
brings
the
imprisoned
to
the
light
wrung
from
the
troubled
spirit
in
hard
hours
of
weakness
solitude
perchance
of
pain
truth
springs
like
harvest
from
the

and
the
soul
feels
it

la

a
worthy
man
of
paris
town
came
to
the
bishop
there
his
face
with
dismay
betrayed
a
fixed
despair
father
said
he
a
sinner
vile
am
i
against
my
will
each
hour
i
humbly
pray
for
faith
but
am
a
doubter
still
sure
were
i
not
despised
of
god
he
would
not
leave
me
so
to
struggle
thus
in
constant
strife
against
the
deadly
foe
the
bishop
to
his
sorrowing
son
thus
spoke
a
kind
relief
the
king
of
france
has
castles
twain
to
each
he
sends
a
chief
there
montelh√©ry
far
inland
that
stands
in
place
secure
while
la
rochelle
upon
the
coast
doth
sieges
oft
endure
now
for
these
castles
both
preserved
first
in
his
prince
love
shall
montelh√©ry
chief
be
placed
or
la
rochelle
above
oh
doubtless
sire
the
sinner
said
that
king
will
love
the
most
the
man
whose
task
was
hard
to
keep
his
castle
on
the
coast
son
said
the
bishop
thou
art
right
apply
this
reasoning
well
my
heart
is
montelh√©ry
fort
and
thine
is
la
rochelle
if
thou
know
i
think
if
thou
know
o
soul
that
will
complain
what
lies
concealed
below
our
burden
and
our
pain
how
just
our
anguish
brings
nearer
those
things
we
seek
for
now
in
vain
i
think
thou
rejoice
and
not
complain
i
think
if
thou
see
with
thy
dim
mortal
sight
how
meanings
dark
to
thee
are
shadows
hiding
light
truth
efforts
crossed
and
vexed
life
purpose
all
perplexed
if
thou
see
them
right
i
think
that
they
would
seem
all
clear
and
wise
and
bright
and
yet
thou
not
know
and
yet
thou
not
see
wisdom
and
sight
are
slow
in
poor
humanity
if
thou
poor
soul
in
him
who
rules
the
whole
thou
find
peace
and
rest
wisdom
and
sight
are
well
but
trust
is
best
my
cross
o
lord
my
god
i
oft
have
said
had
i
some
other
cross
instead
of
this
i
bear
from
day
to
day
easier
to
go
on
my
way
i
do
not
murmur
at
its
weight
that
thou
hast
made
proportionate
to
my
scant
strength
but
oh
full
sore
it
presses
where
it
pressed
before
change
for
a
space
however
brief
the
wonted
burden
that
relief
may
my
aching
shoulders
steal
and
the
deep
bruise
have
room
to
heal
while
thus
i
sadly
sighed
i
heard
my
gracious
father
say
thou
not
trust
my
love
my
child
and
to
thy
cross
be
reconciled
i
fashioned
it
thy
needs
to
meet
nor
were
thy
discipline
complete
without
that
very
pain
and
bruise
which
thy
weak
heart
would
fain
refuse
ashamed
i
answered
as
thou
wilt
i
own
my
faithlessness
and
guilt
welcome
the
weary
pain
shall
be
since
only
that
is
best
for
me
god
knoweth
best
he
took
them
from
me
one
by
one
the
things
i
set
my
heart
upon
they
looked
so
harmless
fair
and
blest
would
they
have
hurt
me
god
knows
best
he
loves
me
so
he
would
not
wrest
them
from
me
if
it
were
not
best
he
took
them
from
me
one
by
one
the
friends
i
set
my
heart
upon
o
did
they
come
they
and
their
love
between
me
and
my
lord
above
were
they
as
idols
in
my
breast
it
may
be
god
in
heaven
knows
best
i
will
not
say
i
did
not
weep
as
doth
a
child
that
wants
to
keep
the
pleasant
things
in
hurtful
play
his
wiser
parent
takes
away
but
in
this
comfort
i
will
rest
he
who
hath
taken
knoweth
best
the
only
solace
o
thou
who
driest
the
mourner
tear
how
dark
this
world
would
be
if
when
deceived
and
wounded
here
we
could
not
fly
to
thee
the
friends
who
in
our
sunshine
live
when
winter
comes
are
flown
and
he
who
has
but
tears
to
give
must
weep
those
tears
alone
but
thou
wilt
heal
that
broken
heart
which
like
the
plants
that
throw
their
fragrance
from
the
wounded
part
breathes
sweetness
out
of
woe
o
who
could
bear
life
stormy
doom
did
not
thy
wing
of
love
come
brightly
wafting
through
the
gloom
our
from
above
then
sorrow
touched
by
thee
grows
bright
with
more
than
rapture

as
darkness
shows
us
worlds
of

never

thomas

consolation
if
none
were

none
were

what
service
could
we
render
i
think
if
we
were
always
glad
we
scarcely
could
be
tender
did
our
beloved
never
need
our
patient
ministration
earth
would
grow
cold
and
miss
indeed
its
sweetest
consolation
if
sorrow
never
claimed
our

and
every
wish
were
granted
patience
would
die
and
hope
depart
life
would
be
disenchanted
banish
far
from
me
all
i
love
the
smiles
of

the
old

and
drive
me
to

the

of

take
all
the

away
from

take
all
that

thee
frederick
william

perfect
through
suffering
god
never
would
send
you
the
darkness
if
he
felt
you
could
bear
the
light
but
you
would
not
cling
to
his
guiding
hand
if
the
way
were
always
bright
and
you
would
not
care
to
walk
by
faith
could
you
always
walk
by
sight
is
true
he
has
many
an
anguish
for
your
sorrowful
heart
to
bear
and
many
a
cruel
for
your
tired
head
to
wear
he
knows
how
few
would
reach
heaven
at
all
if
pain
did
not
guide
them
there
so
he
sends
you
the
blinding
darkness
and
the
furnace
of
heat
is
the
only
way
believe
me
to
keep
you
close
to
his
feet
for
is
always
so
easy
to
wander
when
our
lives
are
glad
and
sweet
then
nestle
your
hand
in
your
and
sing
if
you
can
as
you
go
your
song
may
cheer
some
one
behind
you
whose
courage
is
sinking
low
and
well
if
your
lips
do
quiver
god
will
love
you
better
so
a
little
parable
i
made
the
cross
myself
whose
weight
was

laid
on
me
this
thought
is
torture
as
i
toil
up
life
steep
calvary
to
think
mine
own
hands
drove
the
nails
i
sang
a
merry
song
and
chose
the
heaviest
wood
i
had
to
build
it
firm
and
strong
if
i
had
guessed
if
i
had
dreamed
its
weight
was
meant
for
me
i
should
have
made
a
lighter

a

went
forth
to

his

were
dark
with
woe
he
crushed
the
flowers
beneath
his
feet
nor
smelt
the
perfume
warm
and
sweet
that
prayed
for
pity
everywhere
he
came
to
a
field
that
was
harried
by
iron
and
to

laid
bare
he
shook
the
seed
that
he
carried
that
brown
and
bladeless
place
he
shook
it
as

over

what
think
you
did
i
say
what
was
it
that
i
heard
what
music
was
in
the
air
the
song
of
a
bird
nay
but
the
songs
of
many
thrilled
through
with
praise
and
prayer
of
all
those
voices
not
any
were
sad
of
memory
but
a
sea
of
sunlight
flowed
a
golden
harvest
glowed
and
i
said
thou
only
art
wise
god
of

thee

on

lie

half

the

i

so
much
i
need
thy
grace
to
guide
and
thy
reproving
eye
as
when
the
sound
of
human
praise
grows
pleasant
to
my

in

my
broken

fair

complete
appear
by
failure
and
defeat
made
wise
we
come
to
know
at

what
strength
within
our
weakness
lies
what
weakness
in
our

what
inward
peace
is
born
of

what
power
of

spent
what

o

thy

the

too
much
self
some
evil
upon
rabia
fell
and
one
who
loved
and
knew
her
well
murmured
that
god
with
pain
undue
should
strike
a
child
so
fond
and
true
but
she
replied
believe
and
trust
that
all
i
suffer
is
most
just
i
had
in
contemplation
striven
to
realize
the
joys
of
heaven
i
had
extended
fancy
flights
through
all
that
region
of
delights
had
counted
till
the
numbers
failed
the
pleasures
on
the
blest
entailed
had
sounded
the
ecstatic
rest
i
should
enjoy
on
allah
breast
and
for
these
thoughts
i
now
atone
they
were
of
something
of
my
own
and
were
not
thoughts
of
him
alone
from
the
arabian
the
gain
of
loss
o
thou
so
weary
of
thy
and
so
impatient
of
thy
little
cross
is
it
so
hard
to
bear
thy
daily
trials
and
count
all
earthly
things
a
gainful
loss
canst
thou
forget
thy
christian
superscription
behold
we
count
them
happy
which
endure
what
treasure
wouldst
thou
in
the
land
egyptian
repass
the
stormy
water
to
secure
and
wilt
thou
yield
thy
sure
and
glorious
promise
for
the
poor
fleeting
joys
earth
can
afford
no
hand
can
take
away
the
treasure
from
us
that
rests
within
the
keeping
of
the
lord
a
strange
boon
oft
when
of
god
we
ask
for
fuller
happier
life
he
sets
us
some
new
task
involving
care
and
strife
is
this
the
boon
for
which
we
sought
has
prayer
new
trouble
on
us
brought
this
is
indeed
the
boon
though
strange
to
us
it
seems
we
pierce
the
rock
and
soon
the
blessing
on
us
streams
for
when
we
are
the
most
athirst
then
the
clear
waters
on
us
burst
we
toil
as
in
the
field
wherein
to
us
unknown
a
treasure
lies
concealed
which
may
be
all
our
own
and
shall
we
of
the
toil
complain
that
speedily
will
bring
such
gain
we
dig
the
wells
of
life
and
god
the
waters
gives
we
win
our
way
by
strife
then
he
within
us
lives
and
only
war
could
make
us
meet
for
peace

sacred

so
sweet

when

seek
out
a

on
thou

have
angels
near

me
high
above

depressing

god
sent
me
sorrows
with
a
sigh
i
said
he

not

i
asked
for

i
might

my

shadowed
me

from

might
rest

my

lo
such

filled
my

can
this
be

and
o

sorrow
worn
as
duty
garment
strength
supplies
and
out
of
darkness
meekly
borne
unto
the
righteous
light
doth
rise

me

he

sore
but
the
hammer

afflict
me
no

shall
i
tell
you
the
reason
it
is
that
i
see
the

will
carve
out

shrink
from
no
suffering
how
painful

once
i

my

for
soft
on

shall
glow
when
the

with

deals
blow

blow
god
presses
me
hard

he
gives
patience
too
and
i
say
to
myself
is
no
more
than
my
due
and
no
tone
from
the
organ
can
swell
on
the
breeze
till
the
organist
fingers
press
down
on
the
keys
so
come
then
and
welcome
the
blow
and
the
pain
without
them
no
mortal
to

can
attain

can
the

with

god
chastens
with

joy
follows
on

like

thou
what

on

when
tempted
to
murmur
then
pray
from

will
then

we
on

shall
meet
our
perilous
voyage
past

ere

thou
this

i
can
not

a
spirit
of
lowly
repose
in
the
love
of
the
lamb
that
was
slain
a
heart
to
be
touched
with
his
woes
and
a
care
not
to
grieve
him
again
the
peace
that
my
saviour
has
bought
the
cheerfulness
nothing
can
dim
the
love
that
can
bring
every
thought
into
perfect
obedience
to
him
the
wisdom
his
mercy
to
own
in
the
way
he
directs
me
to
take
to
glory
in
jesus
alone
and
to
love
and
do
good
for
his

all
this
thou
hast
offered
to
me
in

whereon
i
will
rest

o
my
saviour
in
thee
is
the
substance
of
all
my

thy
word
has
commanded
my
prayer
thy
spirit
has
taught
me
to
pray
and
all
my
unholy
despair
is
ready
to
vanish
away
thou
wilt
not
be
weary
of
me
thy

faith
that
will
not

will
not
tremble
on

of
any
earthly
woe
that
will
not
murmur
nor
complain
beneath

chastening
rod
but
in
the
hour
of
grief

pain
will
lean
upon
its

a
faith
that
shines
more
bright

clear
when

rage
without

when
in

knows
no

in

feels
no
doubt
that
bears
unmoved
the

dread

nor
heeds
its
scornful
smile
that
seas
of
trouble
can
not
drown
nor

us
such
a

its

the

yet
in

through

we

we
have
found
his

most
abounded
when

did
abound
thus

our

hath
been
supplied
and

hath
encompassed

still

manna
the
pure

flowers
of
love
and

along
the
wayside
grow
thus
far
the

hath
led
us
and
will
he
now
forsake
the
feeble
ones
whom
for
his
own
it
pleases
him
to
take
oh
never
never
earthly
friends
may
cold
and
faithless
prove
but
his
is
changeless
pity
and
everlasting
love
calmly
we
look
behind

our

past
we

that
all
is

now
and

i
can
trust
i
can
not
see
with
my
small
human
sight
why
god
should
lead
this
way
or
that
for
me
i
only
know
he
saith
child
follow
me
but
i
can
trust
i
know
not
why
my
path
should
be
at
times
so
straitly
hedged
so
strongly
barred
before
i
only
know
god
could
keep
wide
the
door
but
i
can
trust
i
find
no
answer
often
when
beset
with
questions
fierce
and
subtle
on
my
way
and
often
have
but
strength
to
faintly
pray
but
i
can
trust
i
often
wonder
as
with
trembling
hand
i
cast
the
seed
along
the
furrowed
ground
if
ripened
fruit
will
in
my
life
be
found
but
i
can
trust
i
can
not
know
why
suddenly
the
storm
should
rage
so
fiercely
round
me
in
its
wrath
but
this
i
know
god
watches
all
my
path
and
i
can
trust
i
may
not
draw
aside
the
mystic
veil
that
hides
the
unknown
future
from
my
sight
nor
know
if
for
me
waits
the
dark
or
light
but
i
can
trust
i
have
no
power
to
look
across
the
tide
to
see
while
here
the
land
beyond
the
river
but
this
i
know
i
shall
be
god
forever
so
i
can
trust
the
world
is
wide
in
time
and
tide
and
god
is
guide
then
do
not
hurry
that
man
is
blest
who
does
his
best

leaves
the
rest

of
yesterday
it
is
the
lord
appointment
it
quiets
my
restless
will
like
the
voice
of
a
tender
mother
and
my
heart
and
will
are
still
i
will
say
it
over
and
over
this
and
every
day
whatsoever
the
master
orders
come
what
may
it
is
the
lord
appointment
for
only
his
love
can
see
what
is
wisest
best
and
right
what
is
truly
good
for
me
trust
i
know
not
what
the
future
holds
of
good
or
ill
for
me
and
mine
i
only
know
that
god
enfolds
me
in
his
loving
arms
divine
so
i
shall
walk
the
earth
in
trust
that
he
who
notes
the
sparrow
fall
will
help
me
bear
i
must
and
lend
an
ear
i
call
it
matters
not
if
dreams
dissolve
like
mists
beneath
the
morning
sun
for
swiftly
as
the
worlds
revolve
so
swiftly
will
life
race
be
run
it
matters
not
if
hopes
depart
or
life
be
pressed
with
toil
and
care
if
love
divine
shall
fill
my
heart
and
all
be
sanctified
with
prayer
then
let
me
learn
submission
sweet
in
every
thought
in
each
desire
and
humbly
lay
at
his
dear
feet
a
heart
aglow
with
heavenly
fire
sometime
sometime
when
all
life
lessons
have
been
learned
and
sun
and
stars
forevermore
have
set
the
things
which
our
weak
judgment
here
had
spurned
the
things
which
we
grieve
with
lashes
wet
will
flash
before
us
out
of
life
dark
night
as
stars
shine
most
in
deeper
tints
of
blue
and
we
shall
see
how
all
god
plans
were
right
and
how
what
seemed
reproof
was
love
most
true
and
we
shall
see
how
while
we
frown
and
sigh
god
plans
go
on
as
best
for
you
and
me
how
when
we
called
he
heeded
not
our
cry
because
his
wisdom
to
the
end
could
see
and
even
as
prudent
parents
disallow
too
much
of
sweet
to
crooning
baby
hest
so
god
perhaps
is
keeping
from
us
now
life
sweetest
things
because
it
seemeth
best
and
if
sometimes
commingled
with
life
wine
we
find
the
wormwood
and
rebel
and
shrink
be
sure
a
wiser
hand
than
yours
or
mine
poured
out
the
potion
for
our
lips
to
drink
and
if
some
one
we
love
is
lying
low
where
human
kisses
can
not
reach
the
face
o
do
not
blame
the
loving
father
so
but
wear
your
sorrow
with
obedient
grace
and
you
will
shortly
know
that
lengthened
breath
is
not
the
sweetest
gift
god
gives
his
friend
and
that
sometimes
the
sable
pall
of
death
conceals
the
fairest
boon
his
love
can
send
if
we
could
push
ajar
the
gates
of
life
and
stand
within
and
all
god
workings
see
we
could
interpret
all
this
doubt
and
strife
and
for
each
mystery
could
find
a
key
but
not
then
be
content
poor
heart
god
plans
like
lilies
pure
and
white
unfold
we
must
not
tear
the
leaves
apart
time
will
reveal
the
calyxes
of
gold
and
if
through
patient
toil
we
reach
the
land
where
tired
feet
with
sandals
loosed
may
rest
when
we
shall
clearly
know
and
understand
i
think
that
we
will
say
god
knew
the
best
may
louise
riley
smith
o
why
and
whither
god
knows
all
i
only
know
that
he
is
good
and
that
whatever
may
befall
or
here
or
there
must
be
the
best
that
could
for
he
is
merciful
as
just
and
so
by
faith
correcting
sight
i
bow
before
his
will
and
trust
they
seem
he
doeth
all
things
right
john
greenleaf
whittier
not
knowing
i
know
not
what
shall
befall
me
god
hangs
a
mist
my
eyes
and
thus
each
step
of
my
onward
path
he
makes
new
scenes
to
rise
and
every
joy
he
sends
me
comes
as
a
sweet
and
glad
surprise
i
see
not
a
step
before
me
as
i
tread
on
another
year
but
the
past
is
in
god
keeping
the
future
his
mercy
shall
clear
and
what
looks
dark
in
the
distance
may
brighten
as
i
draw
near
for
perhaps
the
dreaded
future
is
less
bitter
than
i
think
the
lord
may
sweeten
the
waters
before
i
stoop
to
drink
or
if
marah
must
be
marah
he
will
stand
beside
its
brink
it
may
be
he
keeps
waiting
till
the
coming
of
my
feet
some
gift
of
such
rare
blessedness
some
joy
so
strangely
sweet
that
my
lips
shall
only
tremble
with
the
thanks
they
can
not
speak
o
restful
blissful
ignorance
is
blessed
not
to
know
it
stills
me
in
those
mighty
arms
which
will
not
let
me
go
and
hushes
my
soul
to
rest
on
the
bosom
which
loves
me
so
so
i
go
on
not
knowing
i
would
not
if
i
might
i
would
rather
walk
in
the
dark
with
god
than
go
alone
in
the
light
i
would
rather
walk
with
him
by
faith
than
walk
alone
by
sight
my
heart
shrinks
back
from
trials
which
the
future
may
disclose
yet
i
never
had
a
sorrow
but
what
the
dear
lord
chose
so
i
send
the
coming
tears
back
with
the
whispered
word
he
knows
mary

i

but
yet
i
know
the
path
must
lead
me
to
immanuel
land
and
when
i
reach
life
summit
i
shall
know
and
understand
i
can
not
always
trace
the
onward
course
my
ship
must
take
but
looking
backward
i
behold
afar
its
shining
wake
illumined
with
god
light
of
love
and
so
i
onward
go
in
perfect
trust
that
he
who
holds
the
helm
the
course
must
know
i
can
not
always
see
the
plan
on
which
he
builds
my
life
for
oft
the
sound
of
hammers
blow
on
blow
the
noise
of
strife
confuse
me
till
i
quite
forget
he
knows
and
oversees
and
that
in
all
details
with
his
good
plan
my
life
agrees
i
can
not
always
know
and
understand
the
master
rule
i
can
not
always
do
the
tasks
he
gives
in
life
hard
school
but
i
am
learning
with
his
help
to
solve
them
one
by
one
and
when
i
can
not
understand
to
say
thy
will
be
done

religious

how
many

think
doubt
the
gravest
sin
unmindful
of
her
double
birth
for
worry
is
her
twin
ah
christian
atheism
seems
the
most
insulting
kind
for
though
the
tongue
says
god
is
love
the
heart
is
deaf
and
blind
how
he
who
marks
the
sparrow
fall
must
be
aggrieved
to
see
these
loud
manifest
such
infidelity
each
fretful
line
upon
their
brow
dug
by
the
plow
of
care
is
treason
to
their
pledge
of
faith
and
satire
on
their
prayer
o
just
to
hold
without
one
fear
the
strong
warm
hand

with
orthodoxy

when
on

i
bade

they
said
quite

tarry
with

deaf
to

with

in

thou

i
wait

above

care
providence
god
knowledge
and
beneficence
consider
the
ravens
lord
according
to
thy
words
i
have
considered
thy
birds
and
i
find
their
life
good
and
better
the
better
understood
sowing
neither
corn
nor
wheat
they
have
all
that
they
can
eat
reaping
no
more
than
they
sow
they
have
more
than
they
could
stow
having
neither
barn
nor
store
hungry
again
they
eat
more
considering
i
see
too
that
they
have
a
busy
life
but
plenty
of
play
in
the
earth
they
dig
their
bills
deep
and
work
well
though
they
do
not
heap
then
to
play
in
the
way
they
are
not
loth
and
their
nests
between
are
better
than
both
but
this
is
when
there
blow
no
storms
when
berries
are
plenty
in
winter
and
worms
when
feathers
are
rife
with
oil
enough
to
keep
the
cold
out
and
send
the
rain
off
if
there
come
indeed
a
long
hard
frost
then
it
looks
as
though
thy
birds
were
lost
but
i
consider
further
and
find
a
hungry
bird
has
a
free
mind
he
is
hungry
but
not
steals
no
comfort
no
grief
doth
borrow
this
moment
is
his
thy
will
hath
said
it
the
next
is
nothing
till
thou
hast
made
it
the
bird
has
pain
but
has
no
fear
which
is
the
worst
of
any
gear
when
cold
and
hunger
and
harm
betide
him
he
does
not
take
them
and
stuff
inside
him
content
with
the
day
ill
he
has
got
he
waits
just
nor
haggles
with
his
lot
neither
jumbles
god
will
with
driblets
from
his
own
still
but
next
i
see
in
my
endeavor
the
birds
here
do
not
live
forever
that
cold
or
hunger
sickness
or
age
finishes
their
earthly
stage
the
rooks
drop
in
cold
nights
leaving
all
their
wrongs
and
rights
birds
lie
here
and
birds
lie
there
with
their
feathers
all
astare
and
in
thine
own
sermon
thou
that
the
sparrow
falls
dost
allow
it
shall
not
cause
me
any
alarm
for
neither
so
comes
the
bird
to
harm
seeing
our
father
thou
hast
said
is
by
the
sparrow
dying
bed
therefore
it
is
a
bless√®d
place
and
a
sharer
in
high
grace
it
cometh
therefore
to
this
lord
i
have
considered
thy
word
and
henceforth
will
be
thy
bird

too

am
i

to
bear
the
heavy
burdens
of
the
day
and
oft
i
walk
with
craven
feet
upon

rough
and
toilsome
way
how
sweet
to
feel
how
passing
sweet
thy
watchful
presence
everywhere
care
thou
for

let
me
not

care
thou
for
me
why
should
i
care
and
looks
of
gloomy
sadness
wear
and
fret
because
i
can
not
see
thy
wisdom
doth
ordain
it
so
the
path
thou
hast
marked
out
for
me
my

plan
is

i
know
it
will
be

sometime
somewhere
care

for
me
why
should
i
care
care
thou
for
me
let
me
not

this
each
new
day
shall
be
my
prayer
thou
who
canst
read
my
inmost
heart
dost
know
i
am
exceeding
frail
both
just
and
merciful
thou
art
whose
loving
kindness
shall
fail
my
human
nature
thou
wilt
spare
care
thou
for
me
i
will
not
care
the
sparrow
i
am
only
a
little
sparrow
a
bird
of
low
degree
my
life
is
of
little
value
but
the
dear
lord
cares
for
me
he
gave
me
a
coat
of
feathers
it
is
very
plain
i
know
with
never
a
speck
of
crimson
for
it
was
not
made
for
show
but
it
keeps
me
warm
in
winter
and
it
shields
me
from
the
rain
were
it
bordered
with
gold
or
purple
perhaps
it
would
make
me
vain
i
have
no
barn
or
storehouse
i
neither
sow
nor
reap
god
gives
me
a
sparrow
portion
but
never
a
seed
to
keep
if
my
meal
is
sometimes
scanty
close
picking
makes
it
sweet
i
have
always
enough
to
feed
me
and
life
is
more
than
meat
i
know
there
are
many
sparrows
all
over
the
world
we
are
found
but
our
heavenly
father
knoweth
when
one
of
us
falls
to
the
ground
though
small
we
are
not
forgotten
though
weak
we
are
never
afraid
for
we
know
that
the
dear
lord
keepeth
the
life
of
the
creatures
he
made
he
knoweth
all
the
twilight
falls
the
night
is
near
i
fold
my
work
away
and
kneel
to
one
who
bends
to
hear
the
story
of
the
day
the
old
old
story
yet
i
kneel
to
tell
it
at
thy
call
and
cares
grow
lighter
as
i
feel
that
jesus
knows
them
all
yes
all
the
morning
and
the
night
the
joy
the
grief
the
loss
the
roughened
path
the
sunbeam
bright
the
hourly
thorn
and
cross
thou
knowest
all
i
lean
my
head
my
weary
eyelids
close
content
and
glad
awhile
to
tread
this
path
since
jesus
knows
and
he
has
loved
me
all
my
heart
with
answering
love
is
stirred
and
every
anguished
pain
and
smart
finds
healing
in
the
word
so
here
i
lay
me
down
to
rest
as
nightly
shadows
fall
and
lean
confiding
on
his
breast
who
knows
and
pities
all
if
to
jesus
for
relief
my
soul
has
fled
by
prayer
why
should
i
give
way
to
grief
or
care
while
i
know
his
providence
disposes
each
event
shall
i
judge
by
feeble
sense
and
yield
to
discontent
sparrows
if
he
kindly
feed
and
verdure
clothe
in
rich
array
can
he
see
a
child
in
need
and
turn
his
eyes
away
he
never
forgets
nay
nay
do
not
tell
me
that
god
will
not
hear
me
i
know
he
is
high
over
all
yet
i
know
just
as
well
that
he
always
is
near
me
and
never
forgets
me
at
all
he
shows
not
his
face
for
its
glory
would
blind
me
yet
i
walk
on
my
way
unafraid
though
lost
in
the
desert
he
surely
would
find
me
his
angels
would
come
to
my
aid
he
sits
on
his
throne
in
the
wonderful
city
and
i
i
am
ashes
and
dust
yet
i
am
at
rest
in
his
wonderful
pity
and
i
in
his
promises
trust
he
lighteth
the
stars
and
they
shine
in
their
places
he
maketh
his
sun
like
a
flame
but
better
and
brighter
to
him
are
the
faces
of
mortals
that
call
on
his
name
nay
nay
do
not
tell
me
that
wrapped
in
his
glory
he
hears
not
my
voice
when
i
cry
he
made
me
he
loves
me
he
knows
all
my
story
i
shall
look
on
his
face
by
and
by
the
sure
refuge
o
i
know
the
hand
that
is
guiding
me
through
the
shadow
to
the
light
and
i
know
that
all
betiding
me
is
meted
out
aright
i
know
that
the
thorny
path
i

that
the

the
brighter
the
rich
design
when
faints
and
fails
each
wilderness
hope
and
the
lamp
of

where
to

the

though
veiled
from

mortal
sight
god

is
all
complete
though
the
darkness
at

be

a

the

holding
me
will
ever
hold
me
fast

the
strength
of
the
arms
that
are
folding
me
will
keep
me
to
the
last
following

i
go
nor

let
him
choose
the
joy
or

of
every

they
can
not
hurt
my
soul
because
in
his
control
i
leave
to
him
the
whole
his
children

as

leads
me
i
am
still
within
his
hand
though
his
purpose
my
doth
oft
withstand
yet
i
wish
that
none
but
his
will
be
done
till
the

be
won
that
he
hath
planned
as

i
am
content
he
will
take
care
all
things
by
his
will
are
sent
that
i
must
bear
to
him

take
my

i
here
the

will
all
seem
clear
when
i

it
is
mine
to

him
soon

shall
wonderfully

what
he
shall
choose
for
me
that
shall
my

be
up
to
the

your

there
are
two
words
of

divine
that
fall
upon
this

of
mine

me
in
the
hour

still
me
in

hour
of
pain
two
words
endued
with
magic
power
sufficient
unto
any
hour
he

cool

bring

relief
from

all
so
to
my
feverish

is
given
this
loving
message
fresh
from

he

strength
in

here
seeks
its

here
angry
billows
never

here
death
can
never
sing
its

my
rising
fears
with
murmuring
fraught

sudden
calm
beneath

dreariness
the

disappointment
our

tending

to
this
to

the
greatest
glory
to
us
the
greatest
bliss
if
all

work
together
for
ends
so
grand

what
need
to
wonder
whether
each
in
itself
is
best
if
some
things
were
omitted
or
altered
as
we
would
the
whole
might
be
unfitted
to
work
for
perfect
good
our
plans
may
be
disjointed
but
we
may
calmly
rest
what
god
has
once
appointed
is
better
than
our
best
we
can
not
see
before
us
but
our
friend
is
always
watching
us
and
knows
the
very
end
what
though
we
seem
to
stumble
he
will
not
let
us
fall
and
learning
to
be
humble
is
not
lost
time
at
all
what
though
we
fondly
reckoned
a
smoother
way
to
go
than
where
his
hand
hath
beckoned
it
will
be
better
so
what
only
seemed
a
barrier
a
shall
be
our
god
is
no
long
tarrier
a
present
help
is
he
and
when
amid
our
blindness
his
disappointments
fall
we
trust
his
whose
wisdom
sends
them
all
the
discord
that
involveth
some
startling
change
of
key
the
master
hand
revolveth
in
richest
harmony
then
tremble
not
and
shrink
not
when
disappointment
nears
be
trustful
still
and
think
not
to
realize
all
fears
while
we
are
meekly
kneeling

thou

all
the
past
how
long
and
blindly
on
the
dark
mountains
the
lost
wanderer
strayed
how
the
good
shepherd
followed
and
how
kindly
he
bore
it
home
upon
his
shoulders
laid
and
healed
the
bleeding
wounds
and
soothed
the
pain
and
brought
back
life
and
hope
and
strength
again
thou
knowest

the

each
temptation
each
toilsome
duty
each
foreboding
fear
all
to
myself
assigned
of
tribulation
or
to

ones
than
self
more
dear
all

memories
as
i
journey
on
longings
for
sunshine

for

gone
thou
knowest
all
the

gleams
of

by
stormy
clouds
too
quickly
overcast
hours
of
sweet
fellowship
and
parting
sadness
and
the
dark
river
to
be
crossed
at
last
oh
what
could
confidence
and
hope
afford
to
tread
this
path
but
this
knowest
lord
thou
knowest
not
alone
as
god
as
our
mortal
weakness
thou
hast
proved
on
earth
with
purest
sympathies
o
saviour
thou
hast
wept
and
thou
hast
loved
and
love
and
sorrow
still
to
thee
may
come
and
find
a
a
rest
a
home
therefore
i
come
thy
gentle
call
obeying
and
lay
my
sins
and
sorrows
at
thy
feet
on
everlasting
strength
my
weakness
staying
clothed
in
thy
robe
of
righteousness
complete
then
rising
and
refreshed
i
leave
thy
throne
and
follow
on
to
know
as
i
am
known
a
great
difference
men
lose
their
ships
the
eager
things
to
try
their
luck
at
sea
but
none
can
tell
by
note
or
count
how
many
there
may
be
one
turneth
east
another
south
they
never
come
again
and
then
we
know
they
must
have
sunk
but
neither
how
nor
when
god
sends
his
happy
birds
abroad
they
less
than
ships
say
we
no
moment
passes
but
he
knows
how
many
there
should
be
one
buildeth
high
another
low
with
just
a
bird
light
care
if
only
one
perchance
doth
fall
god
knoweth
when
and
where
he
careth
for
you
if
i
could
only
surely
know
that
all
these
things
that
tire
me
so
were
noticed
by
my
lord
the
pang
that
cuts
me
like
a
knife
the
lesser
pains
of
daily
life
the
noise
the
weariness
the
strife
what
peace
it
would
afford
i
wonder
if
he
really
shares
in
all
my
little
human
cares
this
mighty
king
of
kings
if
he
who
guides
each
blazing
star
through
realms
of
boundless
space
afar
without
confusion
sound
or
jar
stoops
to
these
petty
things
it
seems
to
me
if
sure
of
this
blent
with
each
ill
would
come
such
bliss
that
i
might
covet
pain
and
deem
whatever
brought
to
me
the
loving
thought
of
deity
and
sense
of
christ
sweet
sympathy
no
loss
but
richest
gain
dear
lord
my
heart
hath
not
a
doubt
that
thou
dost
compass
me
about
with
sympathy
divine
the
love
for
me
once
crucified
is
not
a
love
to
leave
my
side
but
waiteth
ever
to
divide
each
smallest
care
of
mine
moment
by
moment
never
a
trial
that
he
is
not
there
never
a
burden
that
he
doth
not
bear
never
a
sorrow
that
he
doth
not
share
moment
by
moment
i
under
his
care
never
a
heartache
and
never
a
groan
never
a
and
never
a
moan
never
a
danger
but
there
on
the
throne
moment
by
moment
he
thinks
of
his
own
never
a
weakness
that
he
doth
not
feel
never
a
sickness
that
he
can
not
heal

james
mudge
he
careth
for
thee
what
can
it
mean
is
it
aught
to
him
that
the
nights
are
long
and
the
days
are
dim
can
he
be
touched
by
griefs
i
bear
which
sadden
the
heart
and
whiten
the
hair
around
his
throne
are
eternal
calms
and
strong
glad
music
of
happy
psalms
and
bliss
unruffled
by
any
strife
how
can
he
care
for
my
poor
life
and
yet
i
want
him
to
care
for
me
while
i
live
in
this
world
where
the
sorrows
be
when
the
lights
die
down
on
the
path
i
take
when
strength
is
feeble
and
friends
forsake
when
love
and
music
that
once
did
bless
have
left
me
to
silence
and
loneliness
and
life
song
changes
to
sobbing
prayers
then
my
heart
cries
out
for
god
who
cares
when
shadows
hang
me
the
whole
day
long
and
my
spirit
is
bowed
with
shame
and
wrong
when
i
am
not
good
and
the
deeper
shade
of
conscious
sin
makes
my
heart
afraid
and
the
busy
world
has
too
much
to
do
to
stay
in
its
course
to
help
me
through
and
i
long
for
a
saviour
can
it
be
that
the
god
of
the
universe
cares
for
me
oh
wonderful
story
of
deathless
love
each
child
is
dear
to
that
heart
above
he
fights
for
me
when
i
can
not
fight
he
comforts
me
in
the
gloom
of
night
he
lifts
the
burden
for
he
is
strong
he
stills
the
sigh
and
awakes
the
song
the
sorrow
that
bowed
me
down
he
bears
and
loves
and
pardons
because
he
cares
let
all
who
are
sad
take
heart
again
we
are
not
alone
in
hours
of
pain
our
father
stoops
from
his
throne
above
to
soothe
and
quiet
us
with
his
love
he
leaves
us
not
when
the
storm
is
high
and
we
have
safety
for
he
is
nigh
can
it
be

which
he
doth
share

thy

who

on
thee
my

with
thee
the
sad
mysterious
past
let
me
submissive
bow

let
me
be
still

know
that
thou
art

why
should
my
harassed
agitated

go
round

round
this
terrible

in

some
brighter
side

calmly

it

if
a

from
the
blue
yonder
held
out
a

on
which
my

was
writ

i
with
wonder
beheld
unroll

i
do
what

a

to

a

so
great
our

little

by
its

slow
the

flower

mound
scarce
bends
its
pliant
form
when
overhead
the
autumnal

down
in
the
thought
of
god
scarce
conscious
in
their
sober
peace
of
the
wild
storms
abroad
to
think
of
thee
is
almost
prayer
and
is
outspoken
praise

even
passive
thoughts
to
actual
worship
raise
all

with

sadly
to

the
poor

turned
to
bear
the
scourging
of

rods
but
aye
his
heart
within
him
yearned
to
mix
and
lose
its
love
in

roamed
alone
through
weary

by

still
scorned
and
mocked
until
from

pure

again
he
rose

mourned
unconscious
of

the
gloom
the
darkness
and
the
night
that
wrapt
his
burial
spot
wearied
with
doubt
perplexed
and
sad
they
knew
nor
help
nor
guide
while
he
who
bore
the

key
to
open
every
mystery
unknown
was
by
their
side
thus
often
when
we
feel
alone
nor
help
nor
comfort
near
is
only
that
our

are
dim
doubting
and
sad
we
see
not
him

waiteth

more

hath
there
been

all

one
transient
gleam

loveliness

and

shall
never

all
lesser

beautiful
of

scarce

henceforth
fix√®d

my

i
feel
and

illusive

one
reality
show
me
thy
face
i
shall
forget
the
weary
days
of

the
fretting
ghosts
of
vain
regret
shall

my
soul
no
more

and
naught
but
blest
content
and
calm
within
my
breast
reside

me
thy
face
the
heaviest
cross
will
then
seem
light
to
bear
there
will
be
gain
in
every
loss
and
peace
with
every
care
with
such
light
feet
the
years
will
fleet
life
seem
as
brief
as
blest
till
i
have
laid
my
burden
down
and
entered
into
rest
show
me
thy
face

pale

until
the

i
behold

that
i

i
stand
in

great
forever
all
things
to
me
are
divine
i
eat
of
the
heavenly
manna
i
drink
of
the
heavenly
wine
listening
for
god
i
hear
it
often
in
the
dark
i
hear
it
in
the
light
where
the
voice
that
calls
to
me
with
such
a
quiet
might
it
seems
but
echo
to
my
thought
and
yet
beyond
the
stars
it
seems
a
in
a
hush
and
yet
the
planet
jars
o
may
it
be
that
far
within
my
inmost
soul
there
lies
a
that
opens
with
those
voices
of
surprise
and
can
it
be
by
night
and
day
that
firmament
serene
is
just
the
heaven
where
god
himself
the
father
dwells
unseen
o
god
within
so
close
to
me
that
every
thought
is
plain
be
judge
be
friend
be
father
still
and
in
thy
heaven
reign
thy
heaven
is
mine
my
very
soul
thy
words
are
sweet
and
strong
they
fill
my
inward
silences
with
music
and
with
song
they
send
me
challenges
to
right
and
loud
rebuke
my
ill
they
ring
my
bells
of
victory
they
breathe
my
peace
be
still
they
even
seem
to
say
my
child
why
seek
me
so
all
day
now
journey
inward
to
thyself
and
listen
by
the
way
william

allah
house
nanac
the
faithful
pausing
once
to
pray
from
holy
mecca
turned
his
face
away
a
moslem
priest
who
chanced
to
see
him
there
forgetful
of
the
attitude
in
prayer
cried
infidel
how
durst
thou
turn
thy
feet
toward
allah
house
the
sacred
temple
seat
to
whom
the
pious
nanac
thus
replied
knowest
thou
god
house
is
as
the

is
wide

turn
thee

thou
canst
toward

if
the

should

if
the
lord
should
come
in
the
morning
as
i
went
about
my
work
the
little
things
and
the
quiet
things
that
a
servant
can
not
shirk
though
nobody
ever
sees
them
and
only
the
dear
lord
cares
that
they
always
are
done
in
the
light
of
the
sun
would
he
take
me
unawares
if
my
lord
should
come
at
noonday
the
time
of
the
dust
and
heat
when
the
glare
is
white
and
the
air
is
still
and
the
sound
in
the
street
if
my
dear
lord
came
at
noonday
and
smiled
in
my
tired
eyes
would
it
not
be
sweet
his
look
to
meet
would
he
take
me
by
surprise
if
my
lord
came
hither
at
evening
in
the
fragrant
dew
and
dusk
when
the
world
drops
off
its
mantle
of
daylight
like
a
husk
and
flowers
in
wonderful
beauty
and
we
fold
our
hands
in
rest
would
his
touch
of
my
hand
his
low
command
bring
me
zest
why
do
i
ask
and
question
he
is
ever
coming
to
me
morning
and
noon
and
evening
if
i
have
but
eyes
to
see
and
the
daily
load
grows
lighter
the
daily
cares
grow
sweet
for
the
master
is
near
the
master
is
here
i
have
only
to
sit
at
his
feet

the
day
is
long
and
the
day
is
hard
we
are
tired
of
the
march
and
of
keeping
guard
tired
of
the
sense
of
a
fight
to
be
won
of
days
to
live
through
and
of
work
to
be
done
tired
of
ourselves
and
of
being
alone
and
all
the
while
did
we
only
see
we
walk
in
the
lord
own
company
we
fight
but
is
he
who
nerves
our
arm
he
turns
the
arrows
which
else
might
harm
and
out
of
the
storm
he
brings

come
to
me
everywhere
let
the
trees
mean
thee
and
the
grassy
sod
and
the
water
and
the
air
for
thou
art
so
far
that
i
often
doubt
as
on
every
side
i
stare
searching
within
and
looking
without
if
thou
canst
be
anywhere
how
did
men
find
thee
in
days
of
old
how
did
they
grow
so
sure
they
fought
in
thy
name
they
were
glad
and
bold
they
suffered
and
kept
themselves
pure
but
now
they
say
neither
above
the
sphere
nor
down
in
the
heart
of
man
but
only
in
fancy
ambition
and
fear
the
thought
of
thee
began
if
only
that
perfect
tale
were
true
which
ages
have
not
made
old
of
the
endless
many
makes
one
anew
and
simplicity
manifold
but
he
taught
that
they
who
did
his
word
the
truth
of
it
sure
would
know
i
will
try
to
do
it
if
he
be
lord
again
the
old
faith
will
glow
again
the
old
will
blow
that
he
promised
to
their
prayer
and
obeying
the
son
i
too
shall
know
his
father
everywhere

its

round
us
like
a
breath
from

to
sojourn
in

apart

dwell
with

a
little
talk
with
jesus
a
little
talk
with
jesus
how
it
smooths
the
rugged
road
how
it
seems
to
help
me
onward
when
i
faint
beneath
my
load
when
my
heart
is
crushed
with
sorrow
and
my
eyes
with
tears
are
dim
there
is
naught
can
yield
me
comfort
like
a
little
talk
with
him
ah
this
is
what
i
wanting
his
lovely
face
to
see
and
i
not
afraid
to
say
it
i
know
he
wanting
me
he
gave
his
life
my
ransom
to
make
me
all
his
own
and
he
forget
his
promise
to
me
his
purchased
one
i
can
not
live
without
him
nor
would
i
if
i
could
he
is
my
daily
portion
my
medicine
and
food
he
altogether
lovely
none
can
with
him
compare
chiefest
among
ten
thousand
and
fairest
of
the
fair
so
i
wait
a
little
longer
till
his
appointed
time
and
along
the
upward
pathway
my
pilgrim
feet
shall
climb
there
in
my
father
dwelling
where
many
mansions
be
i
shall
sweetly
talk
with
jesus
and
he
will
talk
with
me
nothing
to
wish
or
to
fear
his
name
yields
the
richest
perfume
and
sweeter
than
music
his
voice
his
presence
disperses
my
gloom
and
makes
all
within
me
rejoice
i
should
were
he
always
thus
nigh
have
nothing
to
wish
or
to
fear
no
mortal
so
happy
as
i
my
summer
would
last
all
the
year
content
with
beholding
his
face
my
all
to
his
pleasure
resigned
no
changes
of
season
or
place
would
make
any
change
in
my
mind
while
blest
with
a
sense
of
his
love
a
palace
a
toy
would
appear
and
prisons
would
palaces
prove

would
dwell
with
me

john

the
heart

never
to
fade

fall

into
the
fold
of
the
peace
of
god
he
has
gathered
us
all
there
is
no
heart
like
the
heart
of
jesus
filled
with
a
tender
lore
not
a
throb
or
throe
our
hearts
can
know
but
he
suffered
before
there
is
no
voice
like
the
voice
of
jesus
ah
how
sweet
its
chime
like
the
musical
ring
of
some
rushing
spring
in
the
o
might
we
listen
that
voice
of
jesus
o
might
we
never
roam

our
souls
should
rest
in
peace

his
breast

heavenly
home

the
touch
he
touched

hand

the
fever
left

touched
her
hand

he
only
can
with
the
wondrous
skill
of
the
great
physician
with
the
tender
touch
of
the
son
of
man
and
the
in
the
throbbing
temples
died
out
with
the
flush
on
brow
and
cheek
and
the
lips
that
had
been
so
parched
and
burning
trembled
with
thanks
that
she
could
not
speak
and
the
eyes
where
the
fever
light
had
faded
looked
up
by
her
grateful
tears
made
dim
and
she
rose
and
ministered
in
her
household
she
rose
and
ministered
unto
him
he
touched
her
hand
and
the
fever
left
her
o
blessed
touch
of
the
man
divine
so
beautiful
to
arise
and
serve
him
when
the
fever
is
gone
from
your
life
and
mine
it
may
be
the
fever
of
restless
serving
with
heart
all
thirsty
for
love
and
praise
and
eyes
all
aching
and
strained
with
yearning
toward
goals
in
the
future
days
or
it
may
be
fever
of
spirit
anguish
some
tempest
of
sorrow
that
does
not
down
till
the
cross
at
last
is
in
meekness
lifted
and
the
head
stoops
low
for
the
thorny
crown
or
it
may
be
a
fever
of
pain
and
anger
when
the
wounded
spirit
is
hard
to
bear
and
only
the
lord
can
draw
forth
the
arrows
left
carelessly
cruelly
rankling
there
whatever
the
fever
his
touch
can
heal
it
whatever
the
tempest
his
voice
can
still

shall
say
in

touched

his
bidding

know
thou
forsakest

puts

i
i
have
a
friend
so
precious
so
very
dear
to

he
loves
me
with
such
tender
love
he
loves
so
faithfully
i
could
not
live
apart
from
him
i
love
to
feel
him
nigh
and
so
we
dwell
together
my
lord
and
i
sometimes
i
faint
and
weary
he
knows
that
i
am
weak
and
as
he
bids
me
lean
on
him
his
help
i
gladly
seek
he
leads
me
in
the
paths
of
light
beneath
a
sunny
sky
and
so
we
walk
together
my
lord
and
i
he
knows
how
much
i
love
him
he
knows
i
love
him
well
but
with
what
love
he
loveth
me
my
tongue
can
never
tell
it
is
an
everlasting
love
in
ever
rich
supply
and
so
we
love
each
other
my
lord
and
i
tell
him
all
my
sorrows
i
tell
him
all
my
joys
i
tell
him
all
that
pleases
me
i
tell
him
what
annoys
he
tells
me
what
i
ought
to
do
he
tells
me
how
to
try
and
so
we
talk
together
my
lord
and
i
he
knows
how
i
am
longing
some
weary
soul
to
win
and
so
he
bids
me
go
and
speak
the
loving
word
for
him
he
bids
me
tell
his
wondrous
love
and
why
he
came
to
die
and
so
we
work
together
my
lord
and
i
have
his
yoke
upon
me
and
easy
is
to
bear
in
the
burden
which
he
carries
i
gladly
take
a
share
for
then
it
is
my
happiness
to
have
him
always
nigh
we
bear
the
yoke
together

lord
and
i
shorey
ever
when
tempted
make
me
see
beneath
the
olive
shade
my
god
alone
outstretched
and
bruised
and
bleeding
on
the
earth
he
made
and
make
me
feel
it
was
my
sin
as
though
no
other
sin
there
were
that
was
to
him
who
bears
the

load
that
he
could

through

the

where
all
our

were
laid
upon
thy
bending
shoulders
weighed
and
death
that
sets

was
pang

of
sin
that
burns
these

veins
within

learn
of
thee

of

us
ever
on

of

that
when
thou
shalt
appear
arrayed
in

him
in

hour
when
he
from

a
little
while

i
the
christ

thou
didst
thyself

disgrace
for

suffer
pain
unknown
and
agony

a

of

when
grapes
of

i
found
a

i
found
an

on

why
not
why
not
leave
them
all
with
jesus
all
thy
cares
all
the
things
that
fret
thee
daily
earth
affairs
pour
out
all
thy
sin
and
longing
he
has
felt
need
of
human
love
as
thou
hast
and
has
knelt
at
his
father
feet
imploring
for
the
day
strength
to
guard
against
temptation
by
the
way
why
not
leave
them
all
with
jesus
on
his
breast
find
a
balm
for
all
peace
and
rest
ah
he
knows
that
thou
hast
striven
to
walk
right
longs
to
make
the
thorny
pathway
clear
and
bright
see
he
bathes
thy
feet
all
bleeding
with
his
tears
give
to
him
thyself
thy
burden
and
thy
fears
jesus
on
the
sea
when
the
storm
of
the
mountains
on
galilee
fell
and
lifted
its
waters
on
high
and
the
faithless
disciples
were
bound
in
the
spell
of
mysterious
alarm
their
terrors
to
quell
jesus
whispered
fear
not
it
is
i
the
storm
could
not
bury
that
word
in
the
wave
for
was
taught
through
the
tempest
to
fly
it
shall
reach
his
disciples
in
every
clime
and
his
voice
shall
be
near
in
each
troublous
time
saying
be
not
afraid
it
is
i
when
the
spirit
is
broken
with
sickness
or
sorrow
and
comfort
is
ready
to
die
the
darkness
shall
pass
and
in
gladness
the
wounded
complete
consolation
shall
borrow
from
his
word
it
is
i
when
death
is
at
hand
and
the
cottage
of
clay
is
left
with
a
tremulous
sigh
the
gracious
forerunner
is
smoothing
the
way
for
its
tenant
to
pass
to
unchangeable
day
saying
be
not
afraid
it
is
i
when
the
waters
are
passed
and
the
glories
unknown
burst
forth
on
the
wondering
eye
the
compassionate
lamb
in
the
midst
of
the
throne
shall
welcome
encourage
and
comfort
his
own
and
say
be
not
afraid
it
is
i
let
us
see
jesus
we
would
see
jesus
for
the
shadows
lengthen
across
the
little
landscape
of
our
life
we
would
see
jesus
our
weak
faith
to
strengthen
for
the
last
weariness
the
mortal
strife
we
would
see
jesus
for
life
hand
hath
rested
with
its
dark
touch
on
weary
heart
and
brow
and
though
our
souls
have
many
billows
breasted
others
are
rising
in
the
distance
now
we
would
see
jesus
other
lights
are
paling
which
for
long
years
we
have
rejoiced
to
see
the
blessings
of
our
pilgrimage
are
failing
we
would
not
mourn
them
for
we
come
to
thee
we
would
see
jesus
yet
the
spirit
lingers
round
the
dear
object
it
has
loved
so
long
and
earth
from
earth
will
scarce
unclose
its
fingers
our
love
for
thee
makes
not
this
love
less
strong
we
would
see
jesus
the
strong
whereon
our
feet
are
set
by
sovereign
grace
not
life
or
death
with
all
their
agitation
can
thence
remove
us
if
we
seek
his
face
we
would
see
jesus
sense
is
all
too
blinding
and
heaven
appears
too
dim
and
far
away
we
would
see
jesus
to
gain
the
sweet
reminding
that
thou
hast
promised
our
great
debt
to
pay
we
would
see
jesus
that
is
all
we
needing
strength
joy
and
willingness
come
with
the
sight
we
would
see
jesus
dying
risen
pleading
then
welcome
day
and
farewell
mortal
night
anna

a
song
of
love

we
long
to
see
jesus
we
would
see
jesus
we
have
longed
to
see
him
since
first
the
story
of
his
love
was
told
we
would
that
he
might
sojourn
now
among
us
as
once
he
sojourned
with
the
jews
of
old
we
would
see
jesus
see
the
infant
sleeping
as
on
our
mother
knees
we
too
have
slept
we
would
see
jesus
see
him
gently
weeping
as
we
in
infancy
ourselves
have
wept
we
would
behold
him
as
he
wandered
lowly
no
room
for
him
too
often
in
the
inn
behold
that
life
the
beautiful
the
holy
the
only
sinless
in
this
world
of
sin
we
would
see
jesus
we
would
have
him
with
us
a
guest
beloved
and
honored
at
our
board
how
blessed
were
our
bread
if
it
were
broken
before
the
sacred
presence
of
the
lord
we
would
see
jesus
we
would
have
him
with
us
friend
of
our
households
and
our
children
dear
who
still
should
death
and
sorrow
come
among
us
would
hasten
to
us
and
would
touch
the
bier
we
would
see
jesus
not
alone
in
sorrow
but
we
would
have
him
with
us
in
our
mirth
he
at
whose
right
hand
are
joys
forever
doth
not
disdain
to
bless
the
joys
of
earth
we
would
see
jesus
but
the
wish
is
faithless
thou
still
art
with
us
who
hast
loved
us
well
thy
blessed
promise
i
am
with
you
always
is
ever
faithful

coming
busy
day
whether

to
enthrall
ere
thou
listen
ere
thou
answer

to
jesus
tell
him
all

that

servest
still
tell
jesus
tell
him
all
and
if

creep
thee

we
would
see
jesus
we
would
see
jesus
when
our
hopes
are
brightest
and
all
that
earth
can
grant
is
at
its
best
when
not
a
drift
of
shadow
even
the
lightest
blurs
our
clear
atmosphere
of
perfect
rest
we
would
see
jesus
when
the
joy
of
living
holds
all
our
senses
in
a
realm
of
bliss
that
we
may
know
he
hath
the
power
of
giving
enduring
rapture
more
supreme
than
this
we
would
see
jesus
when
our
pathway
darkens
beneath
the
dread
of
some
impending
ill
when
the
discouraged
soul
no
longer
harkens
to
hope
who
beckons
in
the
distance
still
we
would
see
jesus
when
the
stress
of
sorrow
strains
to
their
utmost
tension
heart
and
brain
that
he
may
teach
us
how
despair
may
borrow
from
faith
the
one
sure
antidote
of
pain
we
would
see
jesus
when
our
best
are
taken
and
we
must
meet
unshared
all
shocks
of
woe
because
he
bore
for
us
alone
forsaken
burdens
whose
weight
no
human
heart
could
know
we
would
see
jesus
when
our
fading
vision
lost
to
the
consciousness
of
earth
and
sky
has
only
insight
for
the
far
elysian
we
would

retrospection
he
was
better
to
me
than
all
my
hopes
he
was
better
than
all
my
fears
he
made
a
road
of
my
broken
works
and
a
rainbow
of
my
tears
the
billows
that
guarded
my
sea
girt
path
but
carried
my
lord
on
their
crest
when
i
dwell
on
the
days
of
my
wilderness
march
i
can
lean
on
his
love
for
the
rest
he
emptied
my
hands
of
my
treasured
store
and
his
covenant
love
revealed
there
was
not
a
wound
in
my
aching
heart
but
the
balm
of
his
breath
hath
healed
oh
tender
and
true
was
the
chastening
sore
in
wisdom
that
taught
and
tried
till
the
soul
that
he
sought
was
trusting
in
him
and
in
nothing
on
earth
beside
he
guided
by
paths
that
i
could
not
see
by
ways
that
i
have
not
known
the
crooked
was
straight
and
the
rough
made
plain
as
i
followed
the
lord
alone
i
praise
him
still
for
the
pleasant
palms
and
the
water
springs
by
the
way
for
the
glowing
pillars
of
flame
by
night
and
the
sheltering
clouds
by
day
there
is
light
for
me
on
the
trackless
wild
as
the
wonders
of
old
i
trace
when
the
god
of
the
whole
earth
went
before
to
search
me
a
resting
place
has
he
changed
for
me
nay
he
changes
not
he
will
bring
me
by
some
new
way
through
fire
and
flood
and
each
crafty
foe
as
safely
as
yesterday
and
if
to
warfare
he
calls
me
forth
he
buckles
my
armor
on
he
greets
me
with
smiles
and
a
word
of
cheer
for
battles
his
sword
hath
won
he
wipes
my
brows
as
i
droop
and
faint
he
blesses
my
hand
to
toil
faithful
is
he
as
he
washes
my
feet
from
the
trace
of
each
earthly
soil
never
a
watch
on
the
dreariest
halt
but
some
promise
of
love
endears
i
read
from
the
past
that
my
future
shall
be
far
better
than
all
my
fears
like
the
golden
pot
of
the

the

the
hours
are
viewless
angels
that
still
go
gliding
by
and
bear
each
minute
record
up
to
him
who
sits
on
high
and
we
who
walk
among
them
as
one
by
one
departs
see
not
that
they
are
hovering
forever
round
our
hearts
like
summer
bees
that
hover
around
the
idle
flowers
they
gather
every
act
and
thought
those
viewless
the
poison
or
the
nectar
the
heart
deep
flower
cups
yield
a
sample
still
they
gather
swift
and
leave
us
in
the
field
and
some
flit
by
on
pinions
of
joyous
gold
and
blue
and
some
flag
on
with
drooping
wing
of
sorrow
darker
hue
but
still
they
steal
the
record
and
bear
it
far
away
their
by
day
and
night
no
magic
power
can
stay
and
as
we
spend
each
minute
that
god
to
us
has
given
the
deeds
are
known
before
his
throne
the
tale
is
told
in
heaven
those
hours
we
see
not
nor
hear
their
noiseless
wings
we
often
feel
too
oft
when
flown
that
they
have
left
their
stings
so
teach
me
heavenly
father
to
meet
each
flying
hour
that
as
they
go
they
may
not
show
my
heart
a
poison
flower
so
when
death
brings
its
shadows
the
hours
that
linger

shall
bear
my

the
earth
puts
on
her
beauty
beneath

and
i
must
rise
to

what
is
my
work
to
search
for
truth

wisdom
to
live
for
christ
alone
to
run
my

unburdened
the
goal
my

to
view
by

the
promise
while
earthly

decay
to
serve

work

shun

bear
my
cross
therein
to
turn
from
all

conquer

work

keep

troth
unshaken
though
others
may
deceive
to
give
with
willing
pleasure

still
with
joy
receive
to
bring
the
mourner
comfort
to
wipe
sad
tears
away
to
help
the
timid
doubter
this
is
my
work
to
bear
another
weakness
to
soothe
another
pain
to
cheer
the
heart
repentant
and
to
forgive
again
to
commune
with
the

all

truth
and
your
gifts
will
be
paid
in

a
song
will
meet
and
the
smile
which
is
sweet
will
surely
find
a
smile
that
is
just
as
sweet
give
pity
and
sorrow
to
those
who
mourn
you
will
gather
in
flowers
again
the
scattered
seeds
from
your
thought
outborne

the
sowing
seemed
in
vain
for

is
the
mirror
of

just
what

sterling
so
live
that
when
thy
summons
comes
to
join
the
innumerable
caravan
which
moves
to
that
mysterious
realm
where
each
shall
take
his
chamber
in
the
silent
halls
of
death
thou
go
not
like
the
quarry
slave
at
night
scourged
to
his
dungeon
but
sustained
and
soothed
by
an
unfaltering
trust
approach
thy
grave
like
one
who
wraps
the
drapery
of
his
couch
about
him
and
lies
down
to
pleasant
dreams

the
time
is
short
if
thou
wouldst
work
for
god
it
must
be
now
if
thou
wouldst
win
the
garlands
for
thy
brow
redeem
the
time
i
sometimes
feel
the
thread
of
life
is
slender
and
soon
with
me
the
labor
will
be
wrought
then
grows
my
heart
to
other
hearts
more
tender
the
time
is
short
the
man
who
idly
sits
and
thinks
may
sow
a
nobler
crop
than
corn

thou
mayst

i
can

behind

that
suffices
me
i
break
the
bounds
i
see
and
nothing
more

and
nothing
less
my
future
is
not
one
of
my
concerns
a
morning
thought
what
if
some
morning
when
the
stars
were
paling
and
the
dawn
whitened
and
the
east
was
clear
strange
peace
and
rest
fell
on
me
from
the
presence
of
a
benignant
spirit
standing
near
and
i
should
tell
him
as
he
stood
beside
me
this
is
our
earth
most
friendly
earth
and
fair
daily
its
sea
and
shore
through
sun
and
shadow
faithful
it
turns
robed
in
its
azure

there
is
blest

here
loving

and

of
truth
and
serene
friendships
dear
but
stay
not

earth
has
one
destroyer
his

flee
lest
he
find
thee
here
and
what
if
then
while
the
still
morning
brightened
and
freshened
in
the
elm
the
summer
breath
should
gravely
smile
on
me
the
gentle
angel
and
take
my
hand
and
say
my
name
is

thou
while

around
thee

last
long

thou

abide
with
us
o
wondrous
guest
a
stranger
still
though
long
possessed
our
hearts
thy
love
unknown
desire
and
marvel
how
the
sacred
fire
should
burn
within
us
while
we
stray
from
that
sad
spot
where
jesus
lay
so
when
our
youth
through
bitter
loss
or
hopes
deferred
draws
near
the
cross
we
lose
the
lord
our
childhood
knew
and
god
own
word
may
seem
untrue
yet
christ
himself
shall
soothe
the
way
towards
the
evening
of
our
day
and
though
we
travel
towards
the
west
is
still
for
toil
and
not
for
rest
no
fate
except
that
life
is
done
at
emmaus
is
our
work
begun
then
let
us
watch
lest
tears
should
hide
the
lord
who
journeys
by
our
side
not
now
but
then
take
the
joys
and
bear
the
sorrows
neither
with
extreme
concern
living
here
means
nescience
simply
is
next
life
that
helps
to
learn
shut
those
eyes
next
life
will
open
stop
those
ears
next
life
will
teach
hearing
office
close
those
lips
next
life
will
give
the
power
of
speech
or
if
action
more
amuse
thee
than
the
passive
attitude
bravely
bustle
through
thy
being
busy
thee
for
ill
or
good
reap
this
life
success
or
failure
soon
shall
things
be
unperplexed
and
the
right
or

unraveled

i
would
live

some
trophy
to
win
some
soul
to
lead
back
from
the
dark
paths
of
sin
some
weak
one
to
strengthen
some
faint
one
to
cheer
and
heaven
will
be
sweeter
for
laboring
here
but
would
i
live

i
decide
with

in

still
here
to

there

the
choicest
gifts
that
heaven
hath
kindly
lent

all
things
that
for
grief

are
worthy

thy
love

care
whose
loss
has
left
us
desolate
are
safely
garnered
there
they
are
not
dead
they
have
but
passed
beyond
the
mists
that
blind
us
here
into
the
new
and
larger
life
of
that
serener
sphere
they
have
but
dropped
their
robe
of
clay
to
put
their
shining
raiment
on
they
have
not
wandered
far
away
they
are
not
lost
or
gone
though
disenthralled
and
glorified
they
still
are
here
and
love
us
yet
the
dear
ones
they
have
left
behind
they
never

i
am
nearing
the
place
the

the

the

of
the
foe

he
stands

the

reward
of
it

i
was
ever
a

so
one

more
the
best

would
hate

bandaged
my

and
forbore
and
bade
me
creep
past
no
let
me
taste
the
whole
of
it
fare

my
peers

heroes
of

the

rage
the
fiend
voices
that
rave
shall
dwindle
shall
blend
shall
change
shall
become
first
a
peace
out
of
pain
then
a
light
then
thy
breast
o
thou
soul
of

robert

our
home
above
we
thank
thee
gracious
father
for
many
a
pleasant
day
for
bird
and
flower
and
joyous
hour
for
friends
and
work
and
play
of
blessing
and
of
mercy
our
life
has
had
its
share
this
world
is
not
a
wilderness
thou
hast
made
all
things
fair
but
fairer
still
and
sweeter
the
things
that
are
above
we
look
and
long
to
join
the
song
in
the
land
of
light
and
love
we
trust
the
word
which
tells
us
of
that
divine
abode
by
faith
we
bring
its
glories
nigh
while
hope
illumes
the
road
so
death
has
lost
its
terrors
how
can
we
fear
it
now
its
face
once
grim
now
leads
to
him
at
whose
command
we
bow
his
presence
makes
us
happy
his
service
is
delight
the
many
mansions
gleam
and
glow
the
saints
our
souls
invite
we
welcome
that
departure
which
brings
us
to
our
lord
we
hail
with
joy
the
blest
employ
those
wondrous
realms
afford
we
call
it
home
up
yonder
down
here
we
toil
and
strain
as
in
some
mine
dark
danksome
depths
there
sunshine
bright
we
gain
to
god
then
sound
the
timbrel
there
naught
can
do
us
harm
our
greatest
foe
has
been
laid
low
what
else
can
cause
alarm
for
freedom
and
for
victory
our
hearts
give
loud
acclaim
befall
on
him
we
call
north
south
east
west
in
him
we
rest
all
glory
to
his
name
james
mudge
at
last
when
on
my
day
of
life
the
night
is
falling
and
in
the
winds
from
unsunned
spaces
blown
i
hear
far
voices
out
of
darkness
calling
my
feet
to
paths
unknown
thou
who
hast
made
my
home
of
life
so
pleasant
leave
not
its
tenant
when
its
walls
decay
o
love
divine
o
helper
ever
present
be
thou
my
strength
and
stay
be
near
me
when
all
else
is
from
me
drifting
earth
sky
home
pictures
days
of
shade
and
shine
and
kindly
faces
to
my
own
uplifting
the
love
which
answers
mine
i
have
but
thee
my
father
let
thy
spirit
be
with
me
then
to
comfort
and
uphold
no
gate
of
pearl
no
branch
of
palm
i
merit
nor
street
of
shining
gold
suffice
it
if
my
good
and
ill
unreckoned
and
both
forgiven
through
thy
abounding
grace
i
find
myself
by
hands
familiar
beckoned
unto
my
fitting
place
some
humble
door
among
thy
many
mansions

thou

sent
a

with

turned
all

crowned
so
little
worth
and
through

changed
my

earth
into

or
by

revelation
brought
the
heavens
down
to

o
the
strangeness
of
the
feeling
o
the
infinite
revealing
to
think
how
god
must
love
me
to
have
made
me
so
content
though
i
would
have
served
him
humbly
and
patiently
and
dumbly
without
any

standing
in

i
went

wait
a

i

not

she
rose
all
transfigured
as
thy
will
is
done
in

so
on

never

i
see
my

i
heard
them

in

the

strange
to
me

seem

for

entering

entereth
never
in

is

whose

sustain
my

anticipation
in
danger
of
soon
shaking
off
earth
last
remaining
fetter
and
of
departing
hence
to
be
with
christ
which
is
far
better
it
a
solemn
thing
to
die
to
face
the
king
immortal
and
each
forgiven
sinner
should
tread
softly
the
portal
but
when
we
have
confessed
our
sins
to
him
who
can
discern
them
and
god
has
given
pardon
peace
tho
we
could
deserve
them
then
dying
is
no
dangerous
thing
safe
in

ransomed

hopeless
lays
his
dead
away

looks
to
see
the
breaking

across

hath
not

gone

had
known

oh
the

since
she
has
gone
away

i
lay
me
down
to
sleep
with
little
thought

care
whether
my
waking
find
me
here
or
there
a
bowing
burdened

asks
to
rest
unquestioning
upon

my

march

that

to
do
at

at

my

is
done
and
this
is
all
my

i
give
a
patient
god
my
patient
heart
and

to

to

ranked
with

for

thee

for
thy

has
come
seeking
his

who
left
thee

where
thy
truth
shall
lead
afloat
upon
its
boundless
sea
who

indeed

oft
depressed

lonely
all
my
fears
are
laid
aside
if
i
but
remember
only
such
as
these
have
lived

died
it
was
only
a
glad
good
morning
as
she
passed
along
the
way

it
spread
the
morning
glory
over
the
livelong
day
for
the
right
against
the
wrong
for
the
weak
against
the
strong
for
the
poor
who
waited
long
for
the
brighter
age
to
be
recompense
the
gifts
that
to
our
breasts
we
fold
are
brightened
by
our
losses
the
sweetest
joys
a
heart
can
hold
grow
up
between
its
crosses
and
on
life
pathway
many
a
mile
is
made
more
glad
and
cheery
because
for
just
a
little

the
way
seemed
dark

dreary

i

i
am
liberty
god
daughter
i
am
of
sinfulness
and
sorrows
full
i
am
only
a
little
sparrow
i
am
part
of
that
power
i
am
so
weak
dear
lord
i
am
thine
own
o
christ
i
am
with
thee
my
god
i
asked
for
grace
to
lift
me
high
i
asked
the
lord
that
i
might
grow
i
asked
the
lord
that
i
might
worthier
be
i
asked
the
lord
to
let
me
do
i
bless
thee
lord
for
sorrows
sent
i
bow
my
forehead
to
the
dust
i
bring
my
sins
to
thee
i
can
not
always
see
the
way
i
can
not
choose
i
should
have
liked
so
much
i
can
not
do
much
said
a
little
star
i
can
not
say
beneath
the
pressure
of
life
cares
i
can
not
see
with
my
small
human
sight
i
can
not
think
but
god
must
know
i
could
not
find
the
little
maid
i
do
not
ask
for
any
crown
i
do
not
ask
for
earthly
store
i
do
not
ask
o
lord
that
life
i
do
not
ask
that
thou
shalt
front
the
fray
i
do
not
know
thy
final
will
i
do
not
know
whether
my
future
lies
i
do
not
know
why
sin
abounds
i
feel
within
me
a
peace
i
find
no
foeman
in
the
road
but
fear
i
go
to
prove
my
soul
i
have
a
friend
so
precious
i
have
a
life
with
christ
to
live
i
have
a
treasure
which
i
prize
i
have
done
at
length
with
dreaming
i
have
labored
in
vain
a
preacher
said
i
have
no
answer
for
myself
or
thee
i
have
seen
the
face
of
jesus
i
have
thee
every
hour
i
hear
it
often
in
the
dark
i
hear
it
singing
singing
sweetly
i
hold
him
great
who
for
love
sake
i
hold
it
as
a
changeless
law
i
hold
it
true
befall
i
hold
it
truth
with
him
who
sings
i
hold
that
since
by
death
alone
i
honor
the
man
who
is
willing
to
sink
i
know
no
life
divided
i
know
not
and
i
would
not
know
i
know
not
if
the
dark
or
bright
i
know
not
if
was
wise
or
well
i
know
not
the
way
i
am
going
i
know
not
what
shall
befall
me
i
know
not
what
the
future
holds
i
know
the
hand
that
is
guiding
me
i
know
this
earth
is
not
my
sphere
i
like
the
man
who
faces
what
he
must
i
live
for
those
who
love
me
i
not
leave
jesus
i
sing
you
a
lay
ere
i
wing
on
my
way
i
look
to
thee
in
every
need
i
love
and
have
some
cause
i
love
my
god
but
with
no
love
of
mine
i
love
thy
skies
thy
sunny
mists
i
love
thy
will
o
god
i
made
the
cross
myself
whose
weight
i
met
a
child
and
kissed
it
i
often
say
my
prayers
i
pray
not
that
men
tremble
i
pray
thee
lord
that
when
it
comes
to
me
i
pray
you
do
not
use
this
thing
i
pray
with
meek
hands
i
preached
as
never
sure
to
preach
again
i
reach
a
duty
yet
i
do
it
not
i
said
it
in
the
meadow
path
i
said
let
me
walk
in
the
fields
i
saw
a
farmer
plow
his
land
i
say
it
over
and
over
i
say
to
thee
do
thou
repeat
i
see
the
right
and
i
approve
i
shall
not
want
in
desert
wilds
i
sing
the
hymn
of
the
conquered
i
sit
within
my
room
and
joy
to
find
i
slept
and
dreamed
that
life
was
beauty
i
stand
in
the
great
forever
i
stand
upon
the
mount
i
stand
upon
the
summit
of
my
life
i
thank
thee
lord
for
mine
unanswered
prayers
i
thank
thee
lord
that
all
my
joy
i
think
if
thou
couldst
know
i
found
a
joy
in
sorrow
i
learned
to
prize
the
i
walk
down
the
valley
of
silence
i
want
so
many
many
i
welcome
all
thy
sovereign
will
i
wonder
if
ever
a
song
was
i
worship
thee
sweet
will
of
god
i
would
be
ready
lord
i
would
not
ask
thee
that
my
days
i
would
see
jesus
as
i
muse
idlers
all
day
about
the
market
place
idly
as
thou
in
that
old
day
if
any
little
word
of
mine
if
every
man
internal
care
if
god
is
mine
then
present
things
if
i
could
feel
my
hand
dear
lord
in
thine
if
i
could
live
to
god
for
just
one
day
if
i
could
only
surely
know
if
i
could
see
a
brother
if
i
have
faltered
more
or
less
if
i
him
but
have
if
i
knew
you
and
you
knew
me
if
i
should
die
if
i
truly
love
the
one
if
i
were
dead
i
think
that
you
if
i
were
told
that
i
must
die
if
jesus
came
to
earth
again
if
jesus
christ
is
a
man
if
life
pleasures
cheer
thee
if
no
kindly
thought
or
word
if
none
were
sick
and
none
were
sad
if
only
he
is
mine
if
suddenly
upon
the
street
if
the
lord
should
come
in
the
morning

the
weather
is
cold

scold

the
wren
can
cling
to
a
spray
if
this
little
world
if
thou
art
blest
then
let
the
sunshine
if
thou
canst
plan
a
noble
deed

thou
something
bring
thy
goods

thou
hast
the
gift
of
strength
if
to
jesus
for
relief
if
we
believed
we
should
if
we
knew
the
cares
and
sorrows
if
we
sit
down
at
set
of
sun
if
washed
in
jesus
blood
if
when
i
kneel
to
pray
if
you
can
not
on
the
ocean
if
you
have
a
friend
worth
having
if
you
have
a
word
of
cheer
immortal
love
forever
full
in
a
napkin
smooth
and
white
in
a
world
where
sorrow
in
all
i
think
or
speak
or
do
in
buds
upon
some
aaron
rod
in
full
and
glad
surrender
in
heavenly
love
abiding
in
humbleness
o
lord
i
ask
in
life
small
things
be
resolute
in
pastures
green
not
always
in
proud
humility
a
pious
man
in
silence
mend
what
ills
deform
in
some
way
or
other
in
spite
of
sorrow
loss
and
pain
in
the
deed
that
no
man
knoweth
in
the
floods
of
tribulation
in
the
hush
of
april
weather
in
the
june
twilight
in
the
pleasant
orchard
closes
in
the
secret
of
his
presence
in
the
still
air
the
music
in
vain
they
smite
me
in
wise
proportion
does
a
fond
hand
mingle
into
thy
guiding
hands
is
it
true
o
christ
in
is
life
worth
living
is
the
work
difficult
is
there
for
honest
poverty
is
thy
cruse
of
comfort
failing
it
becomes
no
man
to
nurse
despair
it
is
bad
to
have
an
empty
purse
it
is
coming
it
is
coming
it
is
enough
enough
just
to
be
good
it
is
faith
the
feeling
it
is
lucifer
the
son
it
is
no
use
to
grumble
and
it
is
not
death
to
die
it
is
not
mine
to
run
it
is
not
prayer
this
clamor
it
is
not
the
deed
we
do
it
is
not
the
wall
of
stone
without
it
is
the
thing
you
do
it
is
the
evening
hour
it
is
worth
while
to
live
it
matters
little
where
i
was
born
it
passeth
knowledge
that
dear
love
of
thine
it
singeth
low
in
every
heart
it
wiser
being
good
than
bad
it
takes
great
strength
to
train
it
was
not
anything
she
said
it
was
only
a
blossom
it
was
only
a
sunny
smile
it
were
not
hard
we
think
jesu
is
in
my
heart
jesus
calls
us
the
tumult
jesus
i
love
thee
not
because
jesus
i
my
cross
have
taken
jesus
saith
and
his
deep
jesus
still
lead
on
jesus
the
calm
that
fills
my
breast
jesus
the
very
thought
jesus
these
eyes
have
never
seen
jesus
thou
joy
of
loving
judge
not
the
workings
of
judge
the
people
by
their
actions
just
as
god
leads
me
i
would
go
just
to
let
thy
father
do
just
where
you
stand
in
the
conflict
keep
pure
thy
soul
keep
pushing
is
wiser
than
sitting
aside
keep
to
the
right
within
and
without
know
well
my
soul
god
hand
controls
knowing
this
that
never
yet
knowing
what
all
experience
serves
to
show
knowledge
and
wisdom
far
from
being
one
labor
with
what
zeal
we
will
laid
on
thine
altar
o
my
lord
divine
leave
god
to
order
all
thy
ways

the

he
who
feels
no

the
camel
at
the
close
of

the
chamber
where
the
good
man
meets
his
fate
the
child
leans
on
its

breast
the
childish
smile
is
fair
the
chivalry
that

the

everyone
the

the

the
cry
of
man
anguish
went
up
the
day
is
long
and
the
day
is
hard
the
dearest
thing
on
earth
to
me
the
deed
ye
do
is
the
prayer
ye
pray
the
deeds
which
selfish
hearts
approve
the
end
so
near
the
eye
with
seeing
is
not
filled
the
fountain
of
joy
is
fed
by
tears
the
glory
is
not
in
the
task
the
good
are
better
made
by
ill
the
grave
itself
is
but
a
covered
bridge
the
hero
is
not
fed
on
sweets
the
holy
supper
is
kept
indeed
the
homely
words
how
often
read
the
hours
are
viewless
angels
the
hours
of
rest
are
over
the
inner
side
of
every
cloud
the
kindly
word
unspoken
the
king
of
love
my
shepherd
is
the
king
proud
favorite
the
knightly
legend
on
thy
shield
the
light
of
love
is
round
his
feet
the
lily
lips
are
pure
and
white
the
little
sharp
vexations
the
longer
on
this
earth
we
live
the
look
of
sympathy
the
gentle
word
the
lord
our
god
is
clothed
the
man
is
happy
lord
the
man
is
thought
a
knave
or
fool
the
man
who
idly
sits
and
thinks
the
man
who
loved
the
names
of
things
the
man
whom
god
delights
to
bless
the
master
came
one
evening
to
the
gate
the
mean
of
soul
are
sure
the
miller
feeds
the
mill
the
mist
denies
the
mountains
the
moving
finger
writes
the
night
is
mother
of
the
day
the
path
of
sorrow
and
that
path
alone
the
poem
hangs
on
the
berry
bush
the
poem
of
the
universe
the
rich
man
son
inherits
lands
the
sands
of
time
are
sinking
the
ship
may
sink
the
simple
silent
selfless
man
the
sky
is
clouded
the
rocks
are
bare
the
smallest
bark
on
life
the
son
of
god
goes
forth
to
war
the
soul
contains
a
window
the
star
of
the
unconquered
will
the
stars
shall
fade
away
the
stars
shine
over
the
earth
the
stormy
blast
is
strong
the
sun
gives
ever
so
the
earth
the
thought
of
god
the
thought
of
thee
the
time
for
toil
is
past
the
time
is
short
the
toil
of
brain
or
heart
or
hand
the
twilight
falls
the
night
is
near
the
unpolished
pearl
can
never
shine
the
way
to
make
thy
son
rich
the
wind
that
flows
can
the
winds
that
once
the
argo
bore
the
wisest
man
could
ask
no
more
the
woman
singeth
at
her
spinning
wheel
the
word
is
great
and
no
deed
is
greater
the
world
is
full
of
beauty
the
world
is
growing
better
the
world
is
wide
in
time
and
tide
the
world
wants
men
thee
will
i
love
my
strength
then
draw
we
nearer
day
by
day
then
fainting
soul
arise
and
sing
then
gently
scan
your
brother
man
then
let
us
smile
when
skies
are
gray
then
o
my
soul
be
afraid
there
are
deep
things
of
god
there
are
hearts
which
never
falter
there
are
hermit
souls
that
live
withdrawn
there
are
in
this
loud
stunning
tide
there
are
loyal
hearts
there
are
spirits
brave
there
are
so
many
helpful
things
to
do
there
are
three
lessons
there
are
two
words
of
light
divine
there
is
a
jewel
which
no
indian
mine
there
is
a
morning
star
my
soul
there
is
a
safe
and
secret
place
there
is
a
tide
in
the
affairs
of
men
there
is
an
ancient
story
told
there
is
an
eye
that
never
sleeps
there
is
never
a
day
so
dreary
there
is
no
death
the
stars
go
down
there
is
no
duty
patent
there
is
no
faith
in
seeing
there
is
no
flock
however
watched
and
tended
there
is
no
great
nor
small
there
is
no
human
being
there
is
no
love
like
the
love
of
jesus
there
is
no
sense
as
i
can
see
there
no
vacant
chair
there
is
peace
in
power
the
men
who
speak
there
lives
and
works
a
soul
in
all
there
once
was
a
man
who
bore
a
grudge
there
was
of
old
a
moslem
saint
there
was
once
a
man
who
smiled
there
was
a
man
who
prayed
there
a
divinity
that
shapes
our
ends
there
a
wideness
in
god
mercy
there
many
a
trouble
there
never
a
day
so
sunny
there
never
a
rose
in
all
the
world
there
not
a
craving
in
the
mind
they
are
slaves
who
fear
to
speak
they
do
me
wrong
who
say
i
come
no
more
they
have
no
place
in
storied
page
they
never
fail
who
die
in
a
great
cause
they
outtalked
thee
hissed
thee
tore
thee
they
richer
who
diminish
their
desires
they
seemed
to
die
on
they
stand
the
regal
mountains
think
and
be
careful
what
thou
art
within
think
gently
of
the
erring
think
not
alone
to
do
right
this
above
all
to
thine
own
self
be
true
this
be
my
prayer
from
this
body

my
house
it
is
not
i
this
for
the
day
of
life
this
i
beheld
or
dreamed
it
this
is
my
creed
this
is
the
gospel
of
labor
this
is
the
highest
learning
this
is
the
ship
of
pearl
this
one
sits
shivering
in
fortune
smile
this
world
no
blot
for
us
thou
broadenest
out
with
every
year

the

he
whose

all
our
longing
powers

love
some
one
more
dearly
to
make
rough
places
plain
to
me
is
equal
whether
love
ordain
to
play
through
life
a
perfect
part
to
stretch
my
hand
and
touch
him
to
thee
o
dear
dear
saviour
to
those
who
prattle
of
despair
to
try
each
day
his
will
to
know
tost
on
a
sea
of
troubles
true
happiness
if
understood
true
love
shall
trust
but
selfish
love
must
die
true
wisdom
is
in
leaning
true
worth
is
in
being
not
seeming
trust
is
truer
than
our
fears
trust
to
the
lord
to
hide
thee
truth
will
prevail
truths

and
the
fierce
sun
was
in
the
night
the
manna
fell

indeed
to

our
eyes
two

saith
two

went
to
pray
o
rather
two
worlds
are
ours
is
only
unanswered
yet
the
prayer
your
lips
have
pleaded
unblemished
let
me
live
unheard
because
our
ears
are
dull
unless
above
himself
he
can
unveil
o
lord
and
on
us
shine
up
and
away
like
the
dew
of
the
morning

the

vice

a
monster
of
so
hateful
mien
vulgar
souls
surpass
a
rare
one
walking
along
the
shore
one
morn
walking
with
peter
christ
we
all
acknowledge
both
thy
power
and
love
we
are
building
every
day
we
are
living
we
are
dwelling
we
are
not
angels
but
we
may
we
bless
thee
for
thy
peace
we
can
not
kindle
when
we
will
we
can
not
make
bargains
for
blisses
we
live
in
deeds
not
years
we
look
along
the
shining
ways
we
look
too
far
for
blessings
we
may
question
with
wand
of
science
we
must
live
through
the
weary
winter
we
say
and
we
say
and
we
say
we
scatter
seeds
with
careless
hand
we
see
not
know
not
all
our
way
we
shape
ourselves
the
joy
or
fear
we
take
our
share
of
fretting
we
thank
thee
gracious
father
we
who
have
lost
the
battle
we
will
speak
on
we
would
fill
the
hours
with
the
sweetest
things
we
would
see
jesus
for
the
shadows
lengthen
we
would
see
jesus
we
have
longed
to
see
him
we
would
see
jesus
when
our
hopes
are
brightest
wearing
the
white
flower
of
a
blameless
life
welcome
the
shadows
where
they
blackest
are
well
to
suffer
is
divine
what
can
it
mean
is
it
aught
to
him
what
grace
o
lord
and
beauty
shone
what
i
am
what
i
am
not
what
if
some
morning
when
the
stars
are
paling
what
imports
fasting
or
feasting
what
is
life
is
not
to
what
is
the
use
of
worrying
what
is
the
world
a
wandering
maze
what
makes
a
hero
not
success
not
fame
what
matter
will
it
be
o
mortal
man
what
might
be
done
if
men
were
wise
what
most
you
wish
and
long
for
what
pleaseth
god
with
joy
receive
what
secret
trouble
stirs
what
shall
i
do
lest
life
in
silence
pass
what
shall
i
pack
up
to
carry
what
shall
i
sing
for
thee
what
shall
thine
afterward
be
what
stronger
breastplate
than
a
heart
untainted
what
though
the
dark
close
round
what
various
hindrances
we
meet
what
weight
of
woe
we
owe
to
thee
what
will
it
matter
in
a
little
while
god
wills
let
my
god
ordains
is
right
whatever
dies
or
is
forgot
whatever
road
i
take
it
joins
the
street
whatever
you
are
be
that
when
courage
fails
and
when
courting
slumber
when
falls
the
hour
of
evil
chance
when
god
afflicts
thee
think
he
hews
a
rugged
stone
when
he
who
sad
and
weary
when
i
have
time
so
many
things
i
do
when
in
the
storm
it
seems
to
thee
when
is
the
time
for
prayer
when
it
drizzles
and
drizzles
when
on
my
day
of
life
the
night
is
falling
when
on
the
fragrant
sandal
tree
when
prayer
delights
thee
least
when
spurred
by
tasks
unceasing
or
undone
when
success
exalts
thy
lot
when
the
storm
of
the
mountains
when
the
sun
of
joy
is
hidden
when
thou
art
fain
to
trace
when
thou
hast
thanked
thy
god
when
thou
turnest
away
from
all
when
thou
wakest
in
the
morning
when
thy
heart
with
joy
when
wilt
thou
save
the
people
when
winds
are
raging
the
upper
ocean
a
noble
deed
is
wrought
where
cross
the
crowded
ways
of
life
i
look
one
face
alone
i
see
whether
we
climb
whether
we
plod
whichever
way
the
wind
doth
blow
while
i
sought
happiness
she
fled
while
thus
to
love
he
gave
his
days
who
bides
his
time
and
day
by
day
who
counts
himself
as
nobly
born
who
does
the
best
his
circumstance
allows
who
drives
the
horses
of
the
sun
who
gives
and
hides
the
giving
hand
who
heeds
not
experience
who
is
as
the
christian
great
who
learns
and
learns
and
acts
not
who
liveth
best
not
he
whose
sail
who
loves
no
law
can
ever
bind
who
has
suffered
he
has
lived
but
half
who
never
doubted
never
half
believed
who
seeks
for
heaven
alone
whoever
plants
a
leaf
beneath
the
sod
why
comes
temptation
but
for
men
to
meet
why
fret
thee
soul
why
not
leave
them
all
with
jesus
why
wakes
not
life
the
desert
bare
and
lone
why
win
we
not
at
once
what
we
in
prayer
require
with
comrade
duty
in
the
dark
with
fame
in
just
proportion
envy
grows
with

course
thy
path

run

as

benediction
with

of

purpose
without

and
without

some
good
be
it
ever
so
slowly

thou
from

relief

yes
