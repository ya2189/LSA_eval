silence
i
have
known
the
silence
of
the
stars
and
of
the
sea
and
the
silence
of
the
city
when
it
pauses
and
the
silence
of
a
man
and
a
maid
and
the
silence
for
which
music
alone
finds
the
word
and
the
silence
of
the
woods
before
the
winds
of
spring
begin
and
the
silence
of
the
sick
when
their
eyes
roam
about
the
room
and
i
ask
for
the
depths
of
what
use

language

beast
of

moans
a
few
times
when
death
takes
its
young
and
we
are
voiceless
in
the
presence
of
realities
we
can
not
speak
a
curious
boy
asks
an
old
soldier
sitting
in
front
of
the
grocery
store
how
did
you
lose
your
leg
and
the
old
soldier
is
struck
with
silence
or
his
mind
flies
away
because
he
can
not
concentrate
it
on
gettysburg
it
comes
back
jocosely
and
he
says
a
bear
bit
it
off
and
the
boy
wonders
while
the
old
soldier
dumbly
feebly
lives
over
the
flashes
of
guns
the
thunder
of
cannon
the
shrieks
of
the
slain
and
himself
lying
on
the
ground
and
the
hospital
surgeons
the
knives
and
the
long
days
in
bed
but
if
he
could
describe
it
all
he
would
be
an
artist
but
if
he
were
an
artist
there
would
be
deeper
wounds
which
he
could
not
describe
there
is
the
silence
of
a
great
hatred
and
the
silence
of
a
great
love
and
the
silence
of
a
deep
peace
of
mind
and
the
silence
of
an
embittered
friendship
there
is
the
silence
of
a
spiritual
crisis
through
which
your
soul
exquisitely
tortured
comes
with
visions
not
to
be
uttered
into
a
realm
of
higher
life
and
the
silence
of
the
gods
who
understand
each
other
without
speech
there
is
the
silence
of
defeat
there
is
the
silence
of
those
unjustly
punished
and
the
silence
of
the
dying
whose
hand
suddenly
grips
yours
there
is
the
silence
between
father
and
son
when
the
father
can
not
explain
his
life
even
though
he
be
misunderstood
for
it
there
is
the
silence
that
comes
between
husband
and
wife
there
is
the
silence
of
those
who
have
failed
and
the
vast
silence
that
covers
broken
nations
and
vanquished
leaders
there
is
the
silence
of
lincoln
thinking
of
the
poverty
of
his
youth
and
the
silence
of
napoleon
after
waterloo
and
the
silence
of
jeanne
saying
amid
the
flames
blessed
jesus
revealing
in
two
words
all
sorrow
all
hope
and
there
is
the
silence
of
age
too
full
of
wisdom
for
the
tongue
to
utter
it
in
words
intelligible
to
those
who
have
not
lived
the
great
range
of
life
and
there
is
the
silence
of
the
dead
if
we
who
are
in
life
can
not
speak
of
profound
experiences
why
do
you
marvel
that
the
dead
do
not
tell
you
of
death
their
silence
shall
be
interpreted
as
we
approach
them
francis
and
lady
clare
antonio
loved
the
lady
clare
he
caught
her
to
him
on
the
stair
and
pressed
her
breasts
and
kissed
her
hair
and
drew
her
lips
in
his
and
drew
her
soul
out
like
a
torch
flare
her
breath
came
quick
her
blood
swirled
round
her
senses
in
a
vortex
swound
she
tore
him
loose
and
turned
around
and
reached
her
chamber
in
a
bound
her
cheeks
turned
to
a
poppy
hue
she
closed
the
door
and
turned
the
lock
her
breasts
and
flesh
were
turned
to
rock
she
reeled
as
drunken
from
the
shock
before
her
eyes
the
devils
skipped
she
thought
she
heard
the
devils
mock
for
had
her
soul
not
been
as
pure
as
sifted
snow
could
she
endure
antonio
passion
and
be
sure
against
his
passion
strength
and
lure
lean
fears
along
her
wonder
slipped
outside
she
heard
a
drunkard
call
she
heard
a
beggar
against
the
wall
shaking
his
cup
a
harlot
squall
struck
through
the
riot
like
a
sword
and
gashed
the
midnight
festival
she
watched
the
city
through
the
pane
the
old
silenus
half
insane
the
idiot
crowd
that
drags
its
chain
and
then
she
heard
the
bells
again
and
heard
the
voices
with
the
word
ecco
il
santo
up
the
street
there
was
the
sound
of
running
feet
from
closing
door
and
window
seat
and
all
the
crowd
turned
on
its
way
the
saint
of
poverty
to
greet
he
passed
and
then
a
circling
thrill
as
water
troubled
which
was
still
went
through
her
body
like
a
chill
who
of
antonio
thought
until
she
heard
the
saint
begin
to
pray
and
then
she
turned
into
the
room
her
soul
was
cloven
through
with
doom
treading
the
softness
and
the
gloom
of
asia
silk
and
persia
wool
and
china
magical
perfume
she
sickened
from
the
vases
hued
in
corals
yellows
greens
the
lewd
twined
dragon
shapes
and
figures
nude
and
tapestries
that
showed
a
brood
of
leopards
by
a
pool
candles
of
wax
she
lit
before
a
pier
glass
standing
from
the
floor
up
to
the
ceiling
off
she
tore
with
eager
hands
her
jewels
then
the
silken
vesture
which
she
wore
her
little
breasts
so
round
to
see
were
budded
like
the
peony
her
arms
were
white
as
ivory
and
all
her
sunny
hair
lay
free
as
marigold
or
celandine
her
blue
eyes
sparkled
like
a
vase
of
crackled
turquoise
in
her
face
was
memory
of
the
mad
embrace
antonio
gave
her
on
the
stair
and
on
her
cheeks
a
salt
tear
trace
like
pigeon
blood
her
lips
were
red
she
clasped
her
bands
above
her
head
under
her
arms
the
waxlight
shed
delicate
halos
where
was
spread
the
downy
growth
of
hair
such
sudden
sin
the
virgin
knew
she
quenched
the
tapers
as
she
blew
puff
puff
upon
them
then
she
threw
herself
in
tears
upon
her
knees
and
round
her
couch
the
curtain
drew
she
called
upon
francis
name
feeling
antonio
passion
maim
her
body
with
his
passion
flame
to
save
her
save
her
from
the
shame
of
fancies
such
as
these
go
by
mad
life
and
old
pursuits
the
wine
cup
and
the
golden
fruits
the
gilded
mirrors
rosewood
flutes
i
would
praise
god
forevermore
with
harps
of
gold
and
silver
lutes
she
stripped
the
velvet
from
her
couch
her
broken
spirit
to
avouch
she
saw
the
devils
slink
and
slouch
and
passion
like
a
leopard
crouch
half
mirrored
on
the
polished
floor
next
day
she
found
the
saint
and
said
i
would
be
god
bride
i
would
wed
poverty
and
i
would
eat
the
bread
that
you
for
anchorites
prepare
for
my
soul
sake
i
am
in
dread
go
then
said
francis
nothing
loth
put
off
this
gown
of
green
snake
cloth
put
on
one
somber
as
a
moth
then
come
to
me
and
make
your
troth
and
i
will
clip
your
golden
hair
she
went
and
came
but
still
there
lay
a
gem
she
did
not
put
away
a
locket
twixt
her
breasts
all
gay
in
shimmering
pearls
and
tints
of
blue
and
inlay
work
of
fruit
and
spray
francis
felt
it
as
he
slipped
his
hand
across
her
breast
and
whipped
her
golden
tresses
ere
he
clipped
he
closed
his
eyes
then
as
he
gripped
the
shears
plunged
the
shears
through
the
waterfall
of
living
gold
the
locks
fell
to
the
floor
and
rolled
and
curled
like
serpents
which
unfold
and
there
sat
lady
clare
despoiled
of
worldly
glory
manifold
she
thrilled
to
feel
him
take
and
hide
the
locket
from
her
breast
a
tide
of
passion
caught
them
side
by
side
he
was
the
bridegroom
she
the
bride
their
flesh
but
not
their
spirits
foiled
thus
was
the
lady
clare
debased
to
sack
cloth
and
around
her
waist
a
rope
the
jeweled
belt
replaced
her
feet
made
free
of
silken
hose
naked
in
wooden
sandals
cased
went
bruised
to
bastia
chapel
then
they
housed
her
in
damian
and
here
she
prayed
for
poor
women
and
here
francis
sought
her
when
his
faith
sank
under
earthly
woes
antonio
cursed
clare
in
rhyme
and
took
to
wine
and
got
the
lime
of
hatred
on
his
soul
in
time
grew
healed
though
left
a
little
lame
and
laughed
about
it
in
his
prime
when
he
could
see
with
crystal
eyes
that
love
is
a
winged
thing
which
flies
some
break
the
wings
some
let
them
rise
from
earth
like
god
dove
to
the
skies
diffused
in
heavenly
flame
the
cocked
hat
would
that
someone
would
knock
bryan
into
a
cocked
woodrow
wilson
it
ai
really
a
hat
at
all
ed
you
know
that
do
you
when
you
bowl
over
six
out
of
the
nine
pins
and
the
three
that
are
standing
are
the
triangular
three
in
front
you
knocked
the
nine
into
a
cocked
hat
if
it
was
really
a
hat
he
would
be
knocked
in
too
which
he
hardly
is
for
a
man
with
money
and
a
man
who
can
draw
a
crowd
to
listen
to
what
he
says
ai
yet
oh
yes
defeated
and
killed
off
a
dozen
times
but
still
he
one
of
the
three
nine
pins
that
standing
eh
why
the
other
is
teddy
the
other
wilson
we
say
we
see
perhaps
but
six
are
down
to
make
the
cocked
hat
that
me
and
thousands
of
others
like
me
and
the
men
who
were
cuffed
about
after
the
civil
war
and
most
of
the
more
than
six
million
men
who
followed
this
fellow
into
the
ditch
while
he
walked
down
the
ditch
and
stepped
to
the
level
following
an
ideal
do
you
remember
how
slim
he
was
and
trim
he
was
with
black
hair
and
pale
brow
and
the
nose
and
flashing
eyes
not
turning
slowly
like
an
owl
but
with
a
sudden
eagle
motion
one
time
in
he
came
here
and
we
had
just
a
dollar
and
sixty
cents
in
the
treasury
of
the
organization
so
i
stuck
his
lithograph
on
a
pole
and
started
out
for
the
station
by
the
time
we
got
back
here
to
clark
street
four
thousand
men
were
marching
in
line
and
a
band
that
was
playing
for
an
opening
of
a
restaurant
on
franklin
street
had
left
the
job
and
was
following
his
carriage
why
it
took
all
the
money
mark
hanna
could
raise
to
beat
me
with
nothing
but
a
pole
and
a
lithograph
and
it
was
because
he
was
one
of
the
prophets
come
back
to
earth
again
it
shows
how
human
hearts
are
hungry
how
wonderfully
true
they
are
and
how
they
will
rise
and
follow
a
man
who
seems
to
see
the
truth
well
these
fellows
who
marched
are
the
cocked
hat
and
i
am
the
cocked
hat
and
the
six
millions
and
more
are
the
cocked
hat
who
got
themselves
despised
or
suspected
of
ignorance
or
something
for
being
with
him
but
still
he
one
of
the
pins
that
standing
he
got
the
money
that
he
went
after
and
he
has
a
place
in
history
perhaps
because
we
took
the
blow
and
fell
down
when
the
ripping
ball
went
wild
on
the
alley
for
we
were
radicals
and
he
was
a
radical
eh
why
a
radical
stands
for
freedom
and
for
truth
which
he
never
finds
but
always
looks
for
a
radical
is
not
a
moralist
a
radical
does
say
this
is
true
and
you
must
believe
it
this
is
good
and
you
must
accept
it
and
if
you
do
believe
it
and
accept
it
we
get
a
law
and
make
you
and
if
you
do
obey
the
law
we
kill
you
oh
no
a
radical
stands
for
freedom
do
you
remember
that
banquet
at
the
tremont
in
on
jackson
day
bryan
and
altgeld
walked
together
out
to
the
banquet
room
that
the
time
he
said
the
bolters
must
bring
fruits
meet
for
repentance
ha
ha
oh
gawd
they
never
did
it
and
they
did
have
to
for
they
had
made
friends
of
the
mammon
of
unrighteousness
even
as
he
did
a
little
later
in
his
own
way
well
darrow
was
there
that
night
i
thought
it
was
terribly
raw
in
him
but
he
said
to
bryan
there
in
a
group
you
better
go
back
to
lincoln
and
study
science
history
philosophy
and
read
flaubert
madam
and
quit
this
village
religious
stuff
you
head
of
the
party
before
you
are
ready
and
a
leader
should
lead
with
thought
and
bryan
turned
to
the
others
and
said
darrow
the
only
man
in
the
world
who
looks
down
on
me
for
believing
in
god
your
kind
of
a
god
snapped
darrow
honest
ed
i
did
see
this
religious
business
in
bryan
in
or
oh
well
i
knew
he
went
to
church
and
talked
as
statesmen
do
of
god
but
mckinley
did
it
and
i
used
to
laugh
we
got
a
man
to
match
mckinley
and
it
good
for
us
in
a
squeeze
like
this
we
did
nominate
some
fellow
ethical
culture
or
unitarian
you
see
the
newspapers
and
preachers
then
were
raising
such
a
hullabaloo
about
irreligion
and
dishonesty
and
calling
old
altgeld
an
anarchist
and
comparing
us
to
robespierre
and
the
guillotine
boys
in
france
and
a
little
of
this
religion
came
in
handy
the
same
as
if
you
saw
a
mason
button
on
me
you
know
you
see
but
gee
he
was
religious
a
man
he
was
a
trained
collie
and
he
looked
like
a
lion
there
in
the
convention
of
what
do
you
know
about
that
but
right
here
i
tell
you
he
ai
a
hypocrite
this
ai
a
pose
but
i
tell
you
in
when
they
knocked
him
out
i
know
what
he
said
to
himself
as
well
as
if
i
heard
him
say
it
i
tell
you
in
a
minute
but
suppose
you
were
giving
a
lecture
on
the
constitution
and
you
got
mixed
on
your
dates
and
the
audience
you
and
some
one
in
the
confusion
stole
the
door
receipts
and
there
you
were
disgraced
and
broke
but
suppose
you
could
just
change
your
clothes
and
lecture
to
the
same
audience
on
the
religious
nature
of
washington
and
be
applauded
and
make
money
you
do
it
would
you
well
this
is
what
bill
said
to
himself
i
naturally
regular
and
religious
i
a
moral
man
and
i
can
prove
it
by
any
one
in
marion
county
or
jacksonville
or
lincoln
nebraska
i
a
radical
but
a
radical
alone
can
be
religious
i
belong
to
the
church
if
not
to
the
bank
of
the
people
who
defeated
me
and
i
prove
to
religious
people
that
i
a
man
to
be
trusted
and
just
what
a
radical
is
and
i
make
some
money
while
winning
the
votes
of
the
churches
over
the
that
it
it
ai
hypocrisy
it
using
what
you
are
for
ends
when
you
find
yourself
in
trouble
and
this
accounts
for
the
prince
of
peace
except
no
one
but
him
could
write
it
and
the
value
of
an
ideal
which
is
money
in
bank
and
several
farms
his
place
in
history
one
time
my
grandfather
who
was
nearly
blind
went
out
to
sow
some
grass
seed
they
had
two
sacks
in
the
barn
one
with
grass
seed
one
with
fertilizer
and
he
got
the
sack
with
fertilizer
and
scattered
it
over
the
ground
thinking
he
was
sowing
grass
and
as
he
was
finishing
up
a
grandchild
dorothy
eight
years
old
followed
him
dropping
flower
seeds
well
after
a
time
that
was
the
greatest
patch
of
weeds
you
ever
saw
and
the
old
man
sat
half
blind
on
the
porch
and
said
good
land
that
grass
is
growing
and
there
was
nothing
but
weeds
except
a
few
nasturtiums
here
and
there
that
dorothy
had
sown
well
i
forgot
there
was
a
sunflower
in
one
corner
that
looked
like
a
man
with
a
golden
beard
and
a
mass
of
tangled
curly
hair
and
a
pumpkin
growing
near
it
say
ed
lend
me
eighty
dollars
to
pay
my
life
insurance
the
vision
of
that
dear
vale
where
you
and
i
have
lain
scanning
the
mysteries
of
life
and
death
i
dreamed
though
how
impassable
the
space
of
time
between
the
present
and
the
past
this
was
the
vision
that
possessed
my
mind
i
thought
the
weird
and
gusty
days
of
march
had
eased
themselves
in
melody
and
peace
pale
lights
swift
shadows
lucent
stalks
clear
streams
cool
rosy
eves
behind
the
penciled
mesh
of
hazel
thickets
and
the
huge
feathered
boughs
of
walnut
trees
stretched
singing
to
the
blast
and
the
first
pleasantries
of
sheep
and
kine
the
cautioned
twitterings
of
hidden
birds
the
flight
of
geese
among
the
scattered
clouds
night
weeping
stars
and
all
the
pageantries
of
awakened
life
had
blossomed
into
may
whilst
she
with
trailing
violets
in
her
hair
blew
music
from
the
stops
of
watery
stems
and
swept
the
grasses
with
her
viewless
robes
which
dreaming
men
thought
voices
dreaming
still
now
as
i
lay
in
vision
by
the
stream
that
flows
amidst
our
well
beloved
vale
i
looked
throughout
the
vista
stretched
between
two
ranging
hills
one
meadowed
rich
in
grass
the
other
wooded
thick
and
quite
obscure
with
overgrowth
rank
in
the
luxury
of
all
wild
places
but
ever
growing
sparse
of
trees
or
saplings
on
the
sudden
slope
that
met
the
grassy
level
of
the
vale
but
still
within
the
shadow
of
those
woods
which
sprinkled
all
beneath
with
fragrant
dew
there
grew
all
flowers
which
tempted
little
paths
between
them
up
and
on
into
the
wood
here
as
the
sun
had
left
his
midday
peak
the
incommunicable
blue
of
heaven
blent
with
his
fierce
splendor
filling
all
the
air
with
softened
glory
while
the
pasturage
trembled
with
color
of
the
poppy
blooms
shook
by
the
steps
of
the
wind
nor
any
sound
beside
disturbed
the
dream
of
silence
slumbering
on
the
drowsy
flowers
then
as
i
looked
upon
the
widest
space
of
open
meadow
where
the
sunlight
fell
in
veils
of
tempered
radiance
i
saw
the
form
of
one
who
had
escaped
the
care
and
equal
dullness
of
our
common
day
for
like
a
bright
mist
rising
from
the
earth
he
made
appearance
growing
more
distinct
until
i
saw
the
stole
likewise
the
lyre
grasped
by
the
fingers
of
the
modeled
hand
yea
i
did
see
the
glory
of
his
hair
against
the
deep
green
filleting
the
ungathered
locks
and
so
throughout
the
vale
his
figure
stood
distinct
and
his
own
shade
was
the
sole
shadow
deeming
this
approach
augur
of
good
as
if
in
hidden
ways
of
loveliness
the
gods
do
still
appear
the
counselors
of
men
and
even
where
wonder
and
meditation
wooed
us
oft
i
cried
apollo
and
his
form
dissolved
as
if
the
nymphs
of
echo
who
took
up
the
voice
and
bore
it
to
the
hollow
wood
by
that
same
flight
had
startled
the
great
god
to
vanishment
and
thereupon
i
woke
and
disarrayed
the
figment
of
my
thought
for
of
the
very
air
magic
with
hues
blent
with
the
distant
objects
i
had
formed
the
splendid
apparition
and
so
knew
it
was
alas
a
dream
within
a
dream
so
we
grew
together
reading
over
your
letters
i
find
you
wrote
me
my
dear
boy
or
at
times
dear
boy
and
the
envelope
said
master
all
as
i
had
been
your
very
son
and
not
the
orphan
whom
you
adopted
well
you
were
father
to
me
and
i
can
recall
the
things
you
did
for
me
or
gave
me
one
time
we
rode
in
a
box
car
to
springfield
to
see
the
greatest
show
on
earth
and
one
time
you
gave
me
redtop
boots
and
one
time
a
watch
and
one
time
a
gun
well
i
grew
to
gawkiness
with
a
voice
like
a
rooster
trying
to
crow
in
august
hatched
in
april
we
say
and
you
went
about
wrapped
up
in
silence
with
eyes
aflame
and
i
heard
little
rumors
of
what
they
were
doing
to
you
and
how
they
wronged
you
and
we
were
poor
so
poor
and
i
could
not
understand
why
you
failed
and
why
if
you
did
good
things
for
the
people
the
people
did
not
sustain
you
and
why
you
loved
another
woman
than
aunt
susan
so
it
was
whispered
at
school
and
what
could
be
baser
or
so
little
to
be
forgiven
they
crowded
you
hard
in
those
days
but
you
fought
like
a
wounded
lion
for
yourself
i
know
but
for
us
for
me
at
last
you
fell
ill
and
for
months
you
tottered
around
the
streets
as
thin
as
death
trying
to
earn
our
bread
your
great
eyes
glowing
and
the
silence
around
you
like
a
shawl
but
something
in
you
kept
you
up
you
grew
well
again
and
rosy
with
cheeks
like
an
indian
peach
almost
and
eyes
full
of
moonlight
and
sunlight
and
a
voice
that
sang
and
a
humor
that
warded
the
arrows
off
but
still
between
us
there
was
reticence
you
kept
me
away
with
a
glittering
hardness
perhaps
you
thought
i
kept
you
away
for
i
was
moving
in
spheres
you
knew
not
living
through
beliefs
you
believed
in
no
more
and
ideals
that
were
just
mirrors
of
unrealities
as
a
boy
can
be
i
was
critical
of
you
and
reasons
for
your
failures
began
to
arise
in
my
mind
i
saw
specific
facts
here
and
there
with
no
philosophy
at
hand
to
weld
them
and
synthesize
them
into
one
truth
and
a
rush
of
the
strength
of
youth
deluded
me
into
thinking
the
world
was
something
so
easily
understood
and
managed
while
i
knew
it
not
at
all
in
truth
and
an
adolescent
egotism
made
me
feel
you
did
not
know
me
or
comprehend
the
all
that
i
was
all
this
you
divined
so
it
went
and
when
i
left
you
and
passed
to
the
world
the
city
still
i
see
you
with
eyes
averted
and
feel
your
hand
limp
with
sorrow
you
could
not
speak
you
thought
of
what
i
might
be
and
where
life
would
take
me
and
how
it
would
end
there
was
longer
silence
a
year
or
two
brought
me
closer
to
you
i
saw
the
play
now
and
the
game
somewhat
and
understood
your
fights
and
enmities
and
hardnesses
and
silences
and
wild
humor
that
had
kept
you
whole
for
your
soul
had
made
it
as
an
antitoxin
to
the
world
infections
and
you
swung
to
me
closer
than
before
and
a
chumship
began
between
us
what
vital
power
was
yours
you
never
tired
or
needed
sleep
or
had
a
pain
or
refused
a
delight
i
loved
the
things
now
you
had
always
loved
a
winning
horse
a
roulette
wheel
a
contest
of
skill
in
games
or
sports
long
talks
on
the
corner
with
men
who
have
lived
and
tell
you
things
with
a
rich
flavor
of
old
wisdom
or
humor
a
woman
a
glass
of
whisky
at
a
table
where
the
fatigue
of
life
falls
and
our
reserves
that
wait
for
happiness
come
up
in
smiles
laughter
gentle
confidences
here
you
were
a
man
with
youth
and
i
a
youth
was
a
man
exulting
in
your
braveries
and
delight
in
life
how
you
knocked
that
scamp
over
at
harry
when
he
tried
to
take
your
chips
and
how
i
who
had
thought
the
devil
in
cards
as
a
boy
loved
to
play
with
you
now
and
watch
you
play
and
watch
the
subtle
mathematics
of
your
mind
prophecy
divine
the
plays
who
was
it
in
your
ancestry
that
you
harked
back
to
and
reproduced
with
such
various
gifts
of
flesh
and
spirit
celt
you
with
such
rapid
wit
and
powerful
skill
for
catching
illogic
and
whipping
fangéd
head
from
the
body
i
was
really
ahead
of
you
at
this
stage
with
more
of
what
man
is
and
what
life
is
at
last
and
how
the
spirit
works
and
by
what
laws
with
what
inevitable
force
but
still
i
was
behind
you
in
that
strength
which
in
our
youth
if
ever
we
have
it
squeezes
all
the
nectar
from
the
grapes
it
seemed
you
never
lose
this
power
and
sense
of
joy
but
yet
at
times
i
saw
another
phase
of
you
there
was
the
day
we
rode
together
north
of
the
old
town
past
the
old
farm
houses
that
i
knew
past
maple
groves
and
fields
of
corn
in
the
shock
and
fields
of
wheat
with
the
fall
green
it
was
october
but
the
clouds
were
summer
lazily
floating
in
a
sky
of
june
and
a
few
crows
flying
here
and
there
and
a
quail
call
and
around
us
a
great
silence
that
held
at
its
core
old
memories
of
pioneers
and
dead
days
forgotten
things
i
never
forget
how
you
looked
that
day
your
hair
was
turning
silver
now
but
still
your
eyes
burned
as
of
old
and
the
rich
olive
glow
in
your
cheeks
shone
with
not
a
line
or
wrinkle
you
seemed
to
me
perfection
a
youth
a
man
and
now
you
talked
of
the
world
with
the
old
wit
and
now
of
the
soul
how
such
a
man
went
down
through
folly
or
wrong
done
by
him
and
how
man
death
can
not
end
all
there
must
be
life
hereafter
as
you
were
that
day
as
you
looked
and
spoke
as
the
earth
was
i
hear
as
the
soul
of
it
all
godard
dvorák
the
morris
dances
mendelssohn
and
old
scotch
songs
the
kye
come
and
moon
had
climbed
the
highest
the
musseta
waltz
and
rudolph
narrative
your
great
brow
seemed
and
the
lust
of
life
in
your
face
cellini
and
your
riotous
fancy
like
dumas
i
was
nearer
you
now
than
ever
before
and
finding
each
other
thus
i
see
how
the
human
soul
seeks
the
human
soul
and
finds
the
one
it
seeks
at
last
for
you
know
you
can
open
a
window
that
looks
upon
embowered
darkness
when
the
flowers
sleep
and
the
trees
are
still
at
midnight
and
no
light
burns
in
the
room
and
you
can
hide
your
butterfly
somewhere
in
the
room
but
soon
you
will
see
a
host
of
butterfly
mates
fluttering
through
the
window
to
join
your
butterfly
hid
in
the
room
it
is
somehow
thus
with
souls
this
day
then
i
understood
it
all
your
vital
democracy
and
love
of
men
and
tolerance
of
life
and
how
the
excess
of
these
had
wrought
your
sorrows
in
the
days
when
we
were
so
poor
and
the
small
of
mind
spoke
of
your
sins
and
your
connivance
with
sinful
men
you
had
lived
it
down
had
triumphed
over
them
and
you
had
grown
prosperous
in
the
world
and
had
passed
into
an
easy
mastery
of
life
and
beyond
the
thought
of
further
conquests
for
things
as
the
brahmins
say
no
more
you
worshiped
matter
or
scarcely
ghosts
or
even
the
gods
with
singleness
of
heart
this
day
you
worshiped
eternal
peace
or
eternal
flame
with
scarce
a
laugh
or
jest
to
hide
your
worship
and
i
understood
seeing
so
many
facets
to
you
why
it
was
blind
condon
always
smiled
to
hear
your
voice
and
why
it
was
in
a
greenroom
years
ago
booth
turned
to
you
marking
your
face
from
all
the
rest
and
said
there
is
a
man
who
might
play
hamlet
better
still
othello
and
why
it
was
the
women
loved
you
and
the
priest
could
feed
his
body
and
soul
together
drinking
a
glass
of
beer
and
visiting
with
you
then
something
happened
your
face
grew
smaller
your
brow
more
narrow
dull
fires
burned
in
your
eyes
your
body
shriveled
you
walked
with
a
cynical
shuffle
your
hands
mixed
the
keys
of
life
you
had
become
a
discord
a
monstrous
hatred
consumed
you
you
had
suffered
the
greatest
wrong
of
all
i
knew
and
granted
the
wrong
you
had
mounted
up
to
sixty
years
now
breathing
hard
and
just
at
the
time
that
honor
belonged
to
you
you
were
dishonored
at
the
hands
of
a
friend
i
wept
for
you
and
still
i
wondered
if
all
i
had
grown
to
see
in
you
and
find
in
you
and
love
in
you
was
just
a
fond
illusion
if
after
all
i
had
not
seen
you
aright
as
a
boy
barbaric
hard
suspicious
cruel
redeemed
alone
by
bubbling
animal
spirits
even
these
gone
now
all
of
you
smoke
laden
with
stinging
gas
and
lethal
vapor
then
you
came
forth
again
like
the
sun
after
storm
the
deadly
uric
acid
driven
out
at
last
which
had
poisoned
you
and
dwarfed
your
soul
so
much
for
soul
the
last
time
i
saw
you
your
face
was
full
of
golden
light
something
between
flame
and
the
richness
of
flesh
you
were
yourself
again
wholly
yourself
and
oh
to
find
you
again
and
resume
our
understanding
we
had
worked
so
long
to
reach
you
calm
and
luminant
and
rich
in
thought
this
time
it
seemed
we
said
but
yes
or
no
that
was
enough
we
smoked
together
and
drank
a
glass
of
wine
and
watched
the
leaves
fall
sitting
on
the
porch
then
life
whirled
me
away
like
a
leaf
and
i
went
about
the
crowded
ways
of
new
york
and
one
night
alberta
and
i
took
dinner
at
a
place
near
fourteenth
street
where
the
music
was
like
the
sun
on
a
lake
when
every
wave
is
a
patine
of
fire
and
i
thought
of
you
not
at
all
looking
at
alberta
and
watching
her
white
teeth
bite
off
bits
of
italian
bread
and
watching
her
smile
and
the
wide
pupils
of
her
eyes
electrified
by
wine
and
music
and
the
touch
of
our
hands
now
and
then
across
the
table
we
went
to
her
house
at
last
and
through
a
languorous
evening
where
no
light
was
but
a
single
candle
we
circled
about
and
about
a
pending
theme
till
at
last
we
solved
it
suddenly
in
rapture
almost
by
chance
and
when
i
left
she
followed
me
to
the
hall
and
leaned
above
the
railing
about
the
stair
for
the
farewell
kiss
and
i
went
into
the
open
air
ecstatically
with
the
stars
in
the
spaces
of
sky
between
the
towering
buildings
and
the
rush
of
wheels
and
clang
of
bells
still
with
the
fragrance
of
her
lips
and
cheeks
and
glinting
hair
about
me
delicate
and
keen
in
spite
of
the
open
air
and
just
as
i
entered
the
brilliant
car
something
said
to
me
you
are
dead
i
had
not
thought
of
you
was
not
thinking
of
you
but
i
knew
it
was
true
as
it
was
for
the
telegram
waited
me
at
my
room
i
did
come
back
i
could
not
bear
to
see
the
breathless
breath
over
your
brow
nor
look
at
your
face
however
you
fared
or
where
to
what
victories
soever
vanquished
or
seemingly
vanquished
rain
in
my
heart
there
is
a
quiet
in
my
heart
like
one
who
rests
from
days
of
pain
outside
the
sparrows
on
the
roof
are
chirping
in
the
dripping
rain
rain
in
my
heart
rain
on
the
roof
and
memory
sleeps

days
like

my

of
you
is

i
would
not
see
you
every
hope
to
know
you

run
fire

in
a
puzzle
bewildering
to
the
eyes

guzzle

seek
the

to
put
away
their

around

pass
beneath

the

as
from

from
a
groggery
where

sold
for
five

twined
with
monstrous

before

a
bagpipe
shrilling
underneath
a

of

whence
a

with

that

rolling
a

so
palely
comes
the
clang
of

the

of

the

for

the

into

near
a

shows

a

stands
mumbling
to
the
of

a

gleams
quickly
with
a
cry
a
legless
man
fastened
upon
a
board
with
casters
it
by
a
sudden
shove
darts
out
of
danger
and
upon
the
corner
a
lassie
tells
a
man
that
god
is
love
holding
a
tambourine
with
its
copper
hoard
to
be
augmented
by
the
drunken
scorner
a
woman
with
no
eyeballs
in
her
sockets
plays
rock
of
ages
on
a
wheezy
organ
a
newsboy
with
cold
hands
thrust
in
his
pockets
cries
all
about
the
will
of
pierpont
morgan
the
roofline
of
the
street
now
sinks
and
dwindles
the
windows
are
begrimed
with
dust
and
beer
a
child
half
clothed
with
legs
as
thin
as

carries
a
basket
with
some
bits
of
coal
between
lace
curtains
eyes
of
yellow

the
cheeks
splotched
with
white
places
like
the
skin
inside
an
eggshell
destitute
of
soul
one
sees
a
brass
lamp
oozing
kerosene
upon
a
stand
whereon
her

lean
lighted
it
soon
will
welcome
negroes
in
the
railroad
tracks
are
near
we
almost
choke
from
filth
whirled
from
the
street
and
stinging
vapors
great
engines
vomit
gas
and
heavy
smoke
upon
a
north
wind
driving
tattered
papers
dry
dung
and
dust
and
refuse
down
the
street
a
circumambient
roar
as
of
a
wheel
whirring
far
off
a
monster
heart
whose
beat
is
full
of
murmurs
comes
as
we
retreat
towards
and
a
man
with
jaw
set
like
a
tiger
with
a
dirty
beard
skulks
toward
the
loop
with
heavy
wrists
glowing
above
his
pockets
where
his
hands
pushed
tensely
round
his
hips
the
coat
tails
draw
and
show
what
seems
a
slender
piece
of
metal
in
his
hip
pocket
on
these
barren
strands
he
waits
for
midnight
for
old
scores
to
settle
against
his
ancient
foe
society
who
keeps
the
soup
house
and
who
builds
the
jails
switchmen
and
firemen
with
their
dinner
pails
go
by
him
homeward
and
he
wonders
if
these
fellows
know
a
hundred
thousand
workers
walk
up
and
down
the
city
highways
stiff
from
cold
and
hunger
doomed
to
poverty
as
wretched
as
the
thieves
and
crooks
and
shirkers
he
scurries
to
the
lake
front
loiters
past
the
windows
of
wax
lights
with
scarlet
shades
where
smiling
diners
back
of
ambuscades
of
silk
and
velvet
hear
not
winter
blast
blowing
across
the
lake
he
has
a
thought
of
michigan
where
once
at
picking
berries
he
spent
a
summer
then
his
eye
is
caught
at
randolph
street
by
written
light
which
tarries
then
like
a
film
runs
into
sentences
he
sees
it
all
as
from
a
black
abyss
taxis
with
skid
chains
rattle
limousines
draw
up
to
awnings
for
a
space
he
catches
a
scent
of
musk
or
violets
sees
the
patches
on
powdered
cheeks
of
furred
and
jeweled
queens
the
color
round
his
cruel
mouth
grows
whiter
he
thrusts
his
coarse
hands
in
his
pockets
tighter
he
is
a
thief
he
knows
he
is
a
thief
he
is
a
thief
found
out
and
as
he
knows
the
whole
loop
is
a
kingdom
held
in
fief
by
men
who
work
with
laws
instead
of
blows
from
sling
shots
so
he
curses
under
breath
the
money
and
the
invisible
hand
that
owns
from
year
to
year
in
spite
of
change
and
death
the
wires
for
the
lights
and
telephones
the
railways
on
the
streets
and
overhead
the
railways
and
beneath
the
winding
tunnel
which
crooks
stole
from
the
city
for
a
runnel
to
drain
her
nickels
and
the
pipes
of
lead
which
carry
gas
wrapped
round
us
like
a
snake
and
round
the
courts
whose
grip
no
court
can
break
he
curses
bitterly
all
those
who
rise
and
rule
by
just
the
spirit
which
he
plies
coarsely
against
the
world
great
store
of
wealth
bankers
and
usurers
and
cliques
whose
stealth
works
witchcraft
through
the
market
and
the
press
and
hires
editors
or
owns
the
stock
controlling
papers
playing
with
finesse
the
city
thinking
that
they
may
unlock
treasures
and
powers
like
burglars
in
the
dark
and
thinking
thus
and
cursing
through
a
flurry
of
sudden
snow
he
hastens
on
to
clark
in
a
cheap
room
there
is
an
eye
to
mark
his
coming
and
be
glad
his
footsteps

will
have
money
earned
this
afternoon
through
men
who
took
her
from

near
saloon
wherein
she
sits
at
table
to
dragoon
roughnecks
or
simpletons
upon
a
lark
within
a
little
hall
a
youth
rants
of
the

swallow

its

the
young

when
the

is
a
plane
of
glass
and
the
blustering
winds
are
still
and
the
strength
of
the
thin
snows
pass
in
mists
the
tawny
hill
the
spirit
of
life
awakes
in
the
fresh
flags
by
the
lakes
when
the
sick
man
seeks
the
air
and
the
graves
of
the
dead
grow
green
where
the
children
play
unaware
of
the
faces
no
longer
seen
when
all
we
have
felt
or
can
feel
and
all
we
are
or
have
been
and
all
the
heart
can
hide
or
reveal
knocks
gently
and
enters
in
the
spirit
of
life
awakes
in
the
fresh
flags
by
the
lakes
in
the
car
we
paused
to
say
as
we
thought
for
a
little
while
alone
in
the
car
in
the
corner
around
the
turn
of
the
aisle
a
quiver
came
in
your
voice
your
eyes
were
sorrowful
too
was
over
i
strode
to
the
doorway
then
turned
to
wave
an
adieu
but
you
had
not
come
from
the
corner
and
though
i
had
gone
so
far
i
retraced
and
faced
you
coming
into
the
aisle
of
the
car
you
stopped
as
one
who
was
caught
in
an
evil
mood
by
i
want
to
forget
i
am
trying
to
forget
the
look
in
your
eyes
your
face
was
blank
and
cold
like
lot
wife
turned
to
salt
i
suddenly
trapped
and
discovered
your
soul
in
a
hidden
fault
your
eyes
were
tearless
and
wide
and
your
wide
eyes
looked
on
me
like
a
mænad
musing
murder
or
the
mask
of
melpomene
and
there
in
a
flash
of
lightning
i
learned
what
i
never
could
prove
that
your
heart
contained
no
sorrow
and
your
heart
contained
no
love
and
my
heart
is
light
and
heavy
and
this
is
the
reason
why
i
am
glad
we
parted
forever
and
sad
for
the
last
simon
surnamed
peter
time
that
has
lifted
you
over
them
all
john
and
paul
writ
you
in
capitals
made
you
the
chief
word
on
the
leaf
how
did
you
peter
when
on
his
breast
you
leaned
and
were
blest
and
none
except
judas
and
you
broke
the
faith
to
the
day
of
his
death
you
peter
the
fisherman
worthy
of
blame
arise
to
this
fame
was
you
in
the
garden
who
fell
into
sleep
and
the
watch
failed
to
keep
when
jesus
was
praying
and
pressed
with
the
weight
of
the
oncoming
fate
was
you
in
the
court
of
the
palace
who
warmed
your
hands
as
you
stormed
at
the
damsel
denying
him
thrice
when
she
cried
he
walked
at
his
side
you
peter
a
wave
a
star
among
clouds
a
reed
in
the
wind
a
guide
of
the
blind
both
smiter
and
flyer
but
human
alway
i
protest
beyond
all
the
rest
when
at
night
by
the
boat
on
the
sea
he
appeared
did
you
wait
till
he
neared
you
leaped
in
the
water
not
dreading
the
worst
in
your
joy
to
be
first
to
greet
him
and
tell
him
of
all
that
had
passed
since
you
saw
him
the
last
you
had
slept
while
he
watched
but
fierce
were
you
fierce
and
awake
when
they
sought
him
to
take
and
cursing
no
doubt
as
you
smote
off
as
one
of
the
least
the
ear
of
the
priest
then
andrew
and
all
of
them
fled
but
you
followed
him
hoping
for
strength
to
save
him
at
length
till
you
lied
to
the
damsel
oh
penitent
peter
and
crept
into
hiding
and
wept
oh
well
but
he
asked
all
the
twelve
who
am
i
and
who
made
reply
as
you
leaped
in
the
sea
so
you
spoke
as
you
smote
with
the
sword
thou
art
christ
even
lord
john
leaned
on
his
breast
but
he
asked
you
your
strength
to
foresee
nay
lovest
thou
me
thrice
over
as
thrice
you
denied
him
and
chose
you
to
lead
his
sheep
and
to
feed
and
gave
you
he
said
the
keys
of
the
den
and
the
fold
to
have
and
to
hold
you
were
a
poor
jailer
oh
peter
the
dreamer
who
saw
the
death
of
the
law
in
the
dream
of
the
vessel
that
held
all
the
beasts
unclean
for
the
priests
and
heard
in
the
vision
a
trumpet
that
all
men
are
worth
the
peace
of
the
earth
and
rapture
of
heaven
hereafter
oh
peter
what
power
was
yours
in
that
hour
you
warder
and
jailer
and
sealer
of
fates
and
decrees
to
use
the
big
keys
with
which
to
reveal
and
fling
wide
all
the
soul
and
the
scheme
of
the
galilee
dream
when
you
flashed
in
a
trice
as
later
you
smote
with
the
sword
thou
art
christ
even
lord
we
men
simon
peter
we
men
also
give
you
the
crown
paul
and
john
we
write
you
in
capitals
make
you
the
chief
word
on
the
leaf
we
know
you
as
one
of
our
flesh
and
is
well
you
are
warder
of
hell
and
heaven
gatekeeper
forever
to
bind
and
to
loose
keep
the
keys
if
you
choose
not
rock
of
you
fire
of
you
make
you
sublime
in
the
annals
of
time
you
were
called
by
him
peter
a
rock
but
we
give
you
the
name
of
peter
the
flame
for
you
struck
a
spark
as
the
spark
from
the
shock
of
steel
upon
rock
the
rock
has
his
use
but
the
flame
gives
the
light
in
the
way
in
the
night
oh
peter
the
dreamer
impetuous
human
divine
gnarled
branch
of
the
vine
all
life
in
a
life
his
father
had
a
large
family
of
girls
and
boys
and
he
was
born
and
bred
in
a
barn
or
kind
of
cattle
shed
but
he
was
a
hardy
youngster
and
grew
to
be
a
boy
with
eyes
that
sparkled
like
a
rod
of
white
hot
iron
in
the
blacksmith
shop
his
face
was
ruddy
like
a
rising
moon
and
his
hair
was
black
as
sheep
wool
that
is
black
and
he
had
rugged
arms
and
legs
and
a
strong
back
and
he
had
a
voice
half
flute
and
half
bassoon
and
from
his
toes
up
to
his
head
top
he
was
a
man
simple
but
intricate
and
most
men
differ
who
try
to
delineate
his
life
and
fate
he
never
seemed
ashamed
of
poverty
or
of
his
origin
he
was
a
wayward
child
nevertheless
though
wise
and
mild
and
thoughtful
but
when
angered
then
he
flamed
as
fire
does
in
a
forge
when
he
was
ten
years
old
he
ran
away
to
be
alone
and
watch
the
sea
and
the
stars
at
midnight
from
a
mountain
gorge
when
he
returned
his
parents
scolded
him
and
threatened
him
with
bolts
and
bars
then
they
grew
soft
for
his
return
and
gay
and
with
their
love
would
have
enfolded
him
but
even
at
ten
years
old
he
had
a
way
of
gazing
at
you
with
a
look
austere
which
gave
his
kinfolk
fear
he
had
no
childlike
love
for
father
or
mother
sister
or
brother
they
were
the
same
to
him
as
any
other
he
was
a
little
cold
a
little
queer
his
father
was
a
laborer
and
now
they
made
the
boy
work
for
his
daily
bread
they
say
he
read
a
book
or
two
during
these
years
of
work
but
if
there
was
a
secret
prone
to
lurk
between
the
pages
under
the
light
of
his
brow
it
came
forth
and
if
he
had
a
woman
in
love
or
out
of
love
or
a
companion
or
a
chum
history
is
dumb
so
far
as
we
know
he
dreamed
and
worked
with
hands
and
learned
to
know
his
genius
commands
or
what
is
called
one
dæmon
and
this
became
at
last
the
city
call
he
had
now
reached
the
age
of
thirty
years
and
found
a
dream
of
life
and
a
solution
for
slavery
of
soul
and
even
all
miseries
that
flow
from
things
material
to
free
the
world
was
his
soul
resolution
but
his
family
had
great
fears
for
him
knowing
the
evil
which
might
befall
him
seeing
that
the
light
of
his
own
dream
had
blinded
his
mind
eyes
they
could
not
tell
but
what
he
had
a
devil
but
still
in
their
tears
despite
and
warnings
he
departed
with
replies
that
when
a
man
genius
calls
him
he
must
obey
no
matter
what
befalls
him
what
he
had
in
his
mind
was
growth
of
soul
by
watching
and
the
creation
of
eyes
over
your
mind
eyes
to
supervise
a
clear
activity
and
to
ward
off
sloth
what
he
had
in
his
mind
was
scotching
and
killing
the
snake
of
hatred
and
stripping
the
glove
from
the
hand
of
hypocrisy
and
quenching
the
fire
of
falsehood
and
unbrotherly
what
he
had
in
his
mind
was
simply
love
and
it
was
strange
he
preached
the
sword
and
force
to
establish
love
but
it
was
not
strange
since
he
did
this
his
life
took
on
a
change
and
what
he
taught
seems
muddled
at
its
source
with
moralizing
and
with
moral
strife
for
morals
are
merely
the
truth
diluted
and
sweetened
up
and
suited
to
the
business
and
bread
of
life
and
now
this
city
was
just
what
you
find
a
city
anywhere
a
turmoil
and
a
vanity
fair
a
sort
of
heaven
and
a
sort
of
tophet
there
were
so
many
leaders
of
his
kind
the
city
did
care
for
one
additional
prophet
he
said
some
extravagant
things
and
planted
a
few
stings
under
the
rich
man
hide
and
one
of
the
sensational
newspapers
gave
him
a
line
or
two
for
cutting
capers
in
front
of
the
palace
of
justice
and
the
church
but
all
of
the
first
grade
people
took
the
other
side
of
the
street
when
they
saw
him
coming
with
a
rag
tag
crowd
singing
and
humming
and
curious
boys
and
men
up
in
a
perch
of
a
tree
or
window
taking
the
spectacle
in
and
the
corybantic
din
of
a
salvation
army
as
it
were
and
whatever
he
dreamed
when
he
lived
in
a
little
town
the
intelligent
people
ignored
him
and
this
is
the
stir
and
the
only
stir
he
made
in
the
city
but
there
was
a
certain
sinister
fellow
who
came
to
him
hearing
of
his
renown
and
said
you
can
be
mayor
of
this
city
we
need
a
man
like
you
for
mayor
and
others
said
you
make
a
lawyer
or
a
politician
look
how
the
people
follow
you
why
do
you
hire
out
as
a
special
writer
you
could
become
a
business
man
a
rhetorician
you
could
become
a
player
you
can
grow
rich
there
nothing
for
a
fighter
fighting
as
you
are
but
to
end
in
ruin
but
he
turned
from
them
on
his
way
pursuing
the
dream
he
had
in
view
he
had
a
rich
man
or
two
who
took
up
with
him
against
the
powerful
frown
which
looked
him
down
for
you
always
find
a
rich
man
or
two
to
take
up
with
anything
there
are
those
who
ca
get
into
society
or
bring
their
riches
to
a
social
recognition
or
souls
who
lack
the
real
patrician
spirit
for
life
but
as
for
him
he
did
care
he
passed
where
the
richness
of
living
was
rife
and
like
wise
goethe
talking
to
the
last
with
cabmen
rather
than
with
lords
he
sat
about
the
markets
and
the
fountains
he
walked
about
the
country
and
the
mountains
took
trips
upon
the
lakes
and
waded
fords
barefooted
laughing
as
a
young
animal
disports
itself
amid
the
festival
of
warm
winds
sunshine
summer
carnival
with
laborers
carpenters
seamen
and
some
loose
women
and
certain
notable
sinners
gave
him
dinners
and
he
went
to
weddings
and
to
places
where
youth
slakes
its
thirst
for
happiness
and
they
served
him
cakes
and
wine
wherever
he
went
and
he
ate
and
drank
and
spent
his
time
in
feasting
and
in
telling
stories
and
singing
poems
of
lilies
and
of
trees
with
crowds
of
people
crowded
around
his
knees
that
searched
with
lightning
secrets
hidden
of
life
and
of
life
glories
of
death
and
of
the
soul
way
after
death
time
makes
amends
usually
for
scandal
breath
which
touched
him
to
his
earthly
ruination
but
this
city
had
a
civic
federation
and
a
certain
social
order
which
intrigues
through
churches
courts
with
an
endless
ramification
of
money
and
morals
to
save
itself
and
this
city
had
a
bar
association
also
its
public
efficiency
leagues
for
laying
honest
men
upon
the
shelf
while
making
private
pelf
secure
and
free
to
increase
and
this
city
had
illustrious
pharisees
and
this
city
had
a
legion
of
men
who
make
a
business
of
religion
with
eyes
one
inch
apart
dark
and
narrow
of
heart
who
give
themselves
and
give
the
city
no
peace
and
who
are
everywhere
the
best
police
for
life
as
business
and
when
they
saw
this
youth
was
telling
the
truth
and
that
his
followers
were
multiplying
and
were
going
about
rejoicing
and
defying
the
social
order
and
were
stirring
up
the
dregs
of
discontent
in
the
cup
with
the
hand
of
their
own
happiness
they
saw
dynamic
mysteries
in
the
poems
of
lilies
and
trees
therefore
they
held
him
for
a
felony
if
you
will
take
a
kernel
of
wheat
and
first
make
free
the
outer
flake
and
then
pare
off
the
meat
of
edible
starch
you
find
at
the
kernel
core
the
life
germ
and
this
young
man
words
were
dim
with
blasphemy
sedition
at
the
rim
which
fired
the
heads
of
dreamers
like
new
wine
but
this
was
just
the
outward
force
of
him
for
this
young
man
philosophy
was
more
than
such
external
ferment
being
divine
with
secrets
so
profound
no
plummet
line
can
altogether
sound
it
it
means
growth
of
soul
by
watching
and
the
creation
of
eyes
over
your
mind
eyes
to
supervise
a
clear
activity
and
to
ward
off
sloth
what
he
had
in
mind
was
scotching
and
killing
the
snake
of
hatred
and
stripping
the
glove
from
the
hand
of
hypocrisy
and
quenching
the
fire
of
falsehood
and
unbrotherly
desire
what
he
had
in
mind
was
simply
love
but
he
was
prosecuted
as
a
rebel
and
as
a
rebel
executed
right
in
a
public
place
where
all
could
see
and
his
mother
watched
him
hang
for
the
felony
he
hated
to
die
being
but
and
fearing
that
his
poems
might
be
lost
and
certain
members
of
the
bar
association
and
of
the
civic
federation
and
of
the
league
of
public
efficiency
and
a
legion
of
men
devoted
to
religion
with
policemen
soldiers
roughs
loose
women
thieves
and
toughs
came
out
to
see
him
die
and
hooted
at
him
giving
up
the
ghost
in
great
despair
and
with
a
fearful
cry
and
after
him
there
was
a
man
named
paul
who
almost
spoiled
it
all
and
protozoan
things
like
hypocrites
and
parasitic
things
who
make
a
food
of
the
mysteries
of
god
for
earthly
power
must
wonder
how
before
this
young
man
hour
they
lived
without
his
blood
shed
on
that
day
and
which
in
red
cells
is
so
rich
what
you
will
april
rain
delicious
weeping
washes
white
bones
from
the
grave
long
enough
have
they
been
sleeping
they
are
cleansed
and
now
they
crave
once
more
on
the
earth
to
gather
pleasure
from
the
springtime
weather
the
pine
trees
and
the
long
dark
grass
feed
on
what
is
placed
below
think
you
not
that
there
doth
pass
in
them
something
we
did
know
this
spell
well
friends
i
greet
ye
once
again
with
joy
but
with
a
most
unuttered
pain
the
city
the
sun
hung
like
a
red
balloon
as
if
he
would
not
rise
for
listless
helios
drowsed
and
yawned
he
cared
not
whether
the
morning
dawned
the
brother
of
eos
and
the
moon
stretched
him
and
rubbed
his
eyes
he
would
have
dreamed
the
dream
again
that
found
him
under
sea
he
saw
zeus
sit
by
hera
side
he
saw
hæphestos
with
his
bride
he
traced
from
enna
flowery
plain
the
child
persephone
there
was
a
time
when
heaven
vault
cracked
like
a
temple
roof
a
new
hierarchy
burst
its
shell
and
as
the
sapphire
ceiling
fell
from
stern
jehovah
mad
assault
vast
spaces
stretched
aloof
great
blue
black
depths
of
frozen
air
engulfed
the
soul
of
zeus
and
then
jehovah
reigned
instead
for
judah
was
living
and
greece
was
dead
and
hope
was
born
to
nurse
despair
and
the
devil
was
let
loose
far
off
in
the
waste
empyrean
the
world
was
a
golden
mote
and
the
sun
hung
like
a
red
balloon
or
a
bomb
afire
a
barracoon
and
the
sea
was
drab
and
the
sea
was
green
like
a
many
colored
coat
the
sea
was
pink
like
cyclamen
and
red
as
a
blushing
rose
it
shook
anon
like
the
sensitive
plant
under
the
golden
light
aslant
the
little
waves
patted
the
shore
again
where
the
restless
river
flows
and
thus
it
has
been
for
ages
gone
for
a
hundred
thousand
years
ere
buddha
lived
or
jesus
came
or
ever
the
city
had
place
or
name
the
sea
thrilled
through
at
the
kiss
of
dawn
like
a
soul
of
smiles
and
tears
when
the
city
seat
was
a
waste
of
sand
and
the
hydra
lived
alone
the
sound
of
the
sea
was
here
to
be
heard
and
the
moon
rose
up
like
a
great
white
bird
sailing
aloft
from
the
yellow
strand
to
her
silent
midnight
throne
now
helios
eyes
the
universe
and
he
knows
the
world
is
small
of
old
he
walked
through
pagan
tyre
babylon
sodom
destroyed
by
fire
and
sought
to
unriddle
the
primal
curse
that
holds
the
race
in
thrall
so
he
stepped
from
the
sun
in
robes
of
flame
as
the
city
woke
from
sleep
he
walked
the
markets
walked
the
squares
he
walked
the
places
of
sweets
and
snares
where
men
buy
honor
and
barter
shame
and
the
weak
are
killed
as
sheep
he
saw
the
city
is
one
great
mart
where
life
is
bought
and
sold
men
rise
to
get
them
meat
and
bread
to
barter
for
drugs
or
coffin
the
dead
and
dawn
is
but
a
heart
for
the
dreary
game
of
gold
ho
ho
said
helios
father
zeus
would
never
botch
it
so
if
he
had
stolen
joseph
bride
and
let
his
son
be
crucified
the
son
blood
had
been
put
to
use
to
ease
the
people
woe
he
of
the
pest
and
the
burning
bush
of
locusts
lice
and
frogs
who
made
me
stand
veiling
my
light
while
joshua
slaughtered
the
amorite
who
blacked
the
skin
of
the
sons
of
cush
and
builded
the
synagogues
and
jehovah
the
great
is
omnipotent
while
zeus
was
bound
by
fate
but
athens
fell
when
peter
took
rome
and
chicago
is
made
his
hecatomb
and
since
from
the
hour
his
son
was
sent
the
hypocrite
holds
the
state
helios
traversed
the
city
streets
and
this
is
what
he
saw
some
sold
their
honor
some
their
skill
the
soldier
hired
himself
to
kill
the
judges
bartered
the
judgment
seats
and
trafficked
in
the
law
the
starving
artist
sold
his
youth
the
writer
sold
his
pen
the
lawyer
sharpened
up
his
wits
like
a
burglar
filing
auger
bits
and
jesus
vicar
sold
the
truth
to
the
famished
sons
of
men
in
every
heart
flamed
cruelty
like
a
little
emerald
snake
and
each
one
knew
if
he
should
stand
in
another
way
the
would
make
the
stronger
the
feofee
of
the
coveted
wapentake
there
not
a
thing
men
will
not
do
for
honor
gold
or
power
we
smile
and
call
the
city
fair
we
call
life
lovely
and
debonair
but
proserpina
never
grew
so
deadly
a
passion
flower
go
live
for
an
hour
in
a
tropic
land
hid
near
a
sinking
pool
the
lion
and
tiger
come
to
drink
the
boa
crawls
to
the
water
brink
the
elephant
bull
kneels
down
in
the
sand
and
drinks
till
his
throat
is
cool
jehovah
will
keep
you
awhile
unseen
as
you
lie
behind
the
rocks
but
go
if
you
dare
to
slake
your
thirst
though
jesus
died
for
our
life
accursed
your
bones
by
the
tiger
will
be
licked
clean
as
he
licks
the
bones
of
an
ox
and
the
sky
may
be
blue
as
fleur
de
lis
and
the
earth
be
tulip
red
and
god
in
heaven
and
life
all
good
while
you
lie
hid
in
the
underwood
and
the
city
may
leave
you
sorrow
free
if
you
ask
it
not
for
bread
one
day
achilles
lost
a
horse
while
the
pest
at
troy
was
rife
and
a
million
maggots
fought
and
ate
like
soldiers
storming
a
city
gate
and
thersites
said
as
he
looked
at
the
corse
achilles
that
is
life
day
fades
and
from
a
million
cells
the
office
people
pour
like
bees
that
crawl
on
the
honeycomb
the
workers
scurry
to
what
is
home
and
trains
and
traffic
and
clanging
bells
make
the
cañon
highways
roar
helios
walked
the
city
ways
till
the
lights
began
to
shine
then
the
janitor
women
start
to
scrub
and
the
pharisees
up
and
enter
the
club
and
the
harlot
wakes
and
the
music
plays
and
the
glasses
glow
with
wine
now
we
good
fellows
one
and
all
and
the
buffet
storms
with
talk
the
market
closed
and
trade
at
end
we
had
our
battle
now
i
your
friend
and
thanks
to
the
spirit
of
alcohol
men
go
for
a
ride
or
walk
oh
but
traffic
is
not
all
done
nor
everything
yet
sold
there
woman
to
win
and
plots
to
weave
there
a
heart
to
hurt
or
one
to
deceive
and
bargains
to
bind
ere
rise
of
sun
to
garner
the
morrow
gold
the
market
at
night
is
as
full
of
fraud
as
the
market
kept
by
day
the
courtesan
buys
a
soul
with
a
look
a
dinner
tempers
the
truth
in
a
book
and
love
is
sold
till
love
is
a
bawd
and
falsehood
froths
in
the
play
and
men
and
women
sell
their
smiles
for
friendship
lifeless
dregs
for
fear
of
the
morrow
we
bend
and
bow
to
moneybags
with
the
slanting
brow
for
the
heart
that
knows
life
little
wiles
seldom
or
never
begs
poor
men
sighed
helios
how
they
long
for
the
ultimate
fire
of
love
they
yearn
through
life
like
the
peacock
moth
and
die
worn
out
in
search
of
the
troth
for
love
in
the
soul
is
the
siren
song
that
wrecks
the
peace
thereof
helios
turned
from
the
world
and
fled
as
the
convent
bell
tolled
six
for
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
an
agéd
crone
who
knelt
beside
a
coffin
alone
she
had
sold
her
cloak
to
shrive
the
dead
and
buy
a
crucifix
the
idiot
two
children
in
a
garden
shouting
for
joy
were
playing
dolls
and
houses
a
girl
and
boy
i
smiled
at
a
neighbor
window
and
watched
them
play
under
a
budding
oak
tree
on
a
wintry
day
and
then
a
board
half
broken
in
the
high
fence
fell
over
and
there
entered
i
know
not
whence
a
jailbird
face
of
yellow
with
a
vacant
sulk
his
body
was
a
sickly
thing
of
bulk
his
open
mouth
was
slavering
and
a
green
light
turned
in
his
eyeballs
like
a
dog
at
night
his
teeth
were
like
a
giant
and
far
apart
i
saw
him
reel
on
the
children
with
a
stopping
heart
he
trampled
their
dolls
and
ruined
the
house
they
made
he
struck
to
earth
the
children
with
a
dirty
spade
as
a
tiger
growls
with
an
antelope
after
the
hunt
over
the
little
faces
i
heard
him
grunt
i
stood
at
the
window
frozen
and
short
of
breath
and
then
i
saw
the
idiot
was
master
death
a
bird
in
the
lilac
bushes
began
to
sing
the
garden
colored
before
me
to
the
kiss
of
spring
and
the
yellow
face
in
a
moment
was
a
mystic
white
the
matted
hair
was
softened
to
starry
light
the
ragged
coat
flowed
downward
into
a
robe
he
carried
a
sword
and
a
balance
and
stood
on
a
globe
i
watched
him
from
the
window
under
a
spell
the
idiot
was
the
angel
azrael
helen
of
troy
on
an
ancient
vase
representing
in
the
flight
of
helen
this
is
the
vase
of
love
whose
feet
would
ever
rove
land
and
sea
whose
hopes
forever
seek
bright
eyes
the
vermeiled
cheek
and
ways
made
free
do
we
not
understand
why
thou
didst
leave
thy
land
thy
spouse
thy
hearth
helen
of
troy
greek
art
hath
made
our
heart
thy
heart
thy
mirth
our
mirth
for
paris
did
appear
curled
hair
and
rosy
ear
and
tapering
hands
he
spoke
the
blood
ran
fast
he
touched
and
killed
the
past
and
clove
its
bands
and
this
i
deem
is
why
the
restless
ages
sigh
helen
for
thee
we
do
or
dream
we
say
or
seem
we
would
be
free
we
would
forsake
old
love
and
all
the
pain
thereof
and
all
the
care
we
would
find
out
new
seas
and
lands
more
strange
than
these
and
flowers
more
fair
we
would
behold
fresh
skies
where
summer
never
dies
and
amaranths
spring
lands
where
the
halcyon
hours
nest
over
scented
bowers
on
folded
wing
we
would
be
crowned
with
bays
and
spend
the
long
bright
days
on
sea
or
shore
or
sit
by
haunted
woods
and
watch
the
deep
sea
moods
and
hear
its
roar
beneath
that
ancient
sky
who
is
not
fain
to
fly
as
men
have
fled
ah
we
would
know
relief
from
marts
of
wine
and
beef
and
oil
and
bread
helen
of
troy
greek
art
hath
made
our
heart
thy
heart
thy
love
our
love
for
poesy
like
thee
must
fly
and
wander
free
as
the
wild
dove
o
glorious
france
you
have
become
a
forge
of
snow
white
fire
a
crucible
of
molten
steel
o
france
your
sons
are
stars
who
cluster
to
a
dawn
and
fade
in
light
for
you
o
glorious
france
they
pass
through
meteor
changes
with
a
song
which
to
all
islands
and
all
continents
says
life
is
neither
comfort
wealth
nor
fame
nor
quiet
hearthstones
friendship
wife
nor
child
nor
love
nor
youth
delight
nor
manhood
power
nor
many
days
spent
in
a
chosen
work
nor
honored
merit
nor
the
patterned
theme
of
daily
labor
nor
the
crowns
nor
wreaths
or
seventy
years
these
are
not
all
of
life
o
france
whose
sons
amid
the
rolling
thunder
of
cannon
stand
in
trenches
where
the
dead
clog
the
ensanguinéd
ice
but
life
to
these
prophetic
and
enraptured
souls
is
vision
and
the
keen
ecstasy
of
fated
strife
and
divination
of
the
loss
as
gain
and
reading
mysteries
with
brightened
eyes
in
fiery
shock
and
dazzling
pain
before
the
orient
splendor
of
the
face
of
death
as
a
great
light
beside
a
shadowy
sea
and
in
a
high
will
strenuous
exercise
where
the
warmed
spirit
finds
its
fullest
strength
and
is
no
more
afraid
and
in
the
stroke
of
azure
lightning
when
the
hidden
essence
and
shifting
meaning
of
man
spiritual
worth
and
mystical
significance
in
time
are
instantly
distilled
to
one
clear
drop
which
mirrors
earth
and
heaven
this
is
life
flaming
to
heaven
in
a
minute
span
when
the
breath
of
battle
blows
the
smoldering
spark
and
across
these
seas
we
who
cry
peace
and
treasure
life
and
cling
to
cities
happiness
or
daily
toil
for
daily
bread
or
trail
the
long
routine
of
seventy
years
taste
not
the
terrible
wine
whereof
you
drink
who
drain
and
toss
the
cup
empty
and
ringing
by
the
finished
feast
or
have
it
shaken
from
your
hand
by
sight
of
god
against
the
olive
woods
as
joan
of
arc
amid
the
apple
trees
with
sacred
joy
first
heard
the
voices
then
obeying
plunged
at
orleans
in
a
field
of
spears
and
lived
her
dream
and
died
in
fire
thou
france
hast
heard
the
voices
and
hast
lived
the
dream
and
known
the
meaning
of
the
dream
and
read
its
riddle
how
the
soul
of
man
may
to
one
greatest
purpose
make
itself
a
lens
of
clearness
how
it
loves
the
cup
of
deepest
truth
and
how
its
bitterest
gall
turns
sweet
to
soul
surrender
and
you
say
take
days
for
repetition
stretch
your
hands
for
mocked
renewal
of
familiar
things
the
beaten
path
the
chair
beside
the
window
the
crowded
street
the
task
the
accustomed
sleep
and
waking
to
the
task
or
many
springs
of
lifted
cloud
blue
water
flowering
fields
the
prison
house
grows
close
no
less
the
feast
a
place
of
memory
sick
for
senses
dulled
down
to
the
dusty
end
where
pitiful
time
grown
weary
cries
enough
for
a
dance
there
is
in
the
dance
the
joy
of
children
on
a
may
day
lawn
the
fragments
of
old
dreams
and
dead
romance
come
to
us
from
the
dancers
who
are
gone
what
strains
of
ancient
blood
move
quicker
to
the
music
passionate
beat
i
see
the
gulls
fly
over
a
shadowy
flood
and
munster
fields
of
barley
and
of
wheat
and
i
see
sunny
france
and
the
vine
tendrils
quivering
to
the
light
and
faces
faces
yearning
for
the
dance
with
wistful
eyes
that
look
on
our
delight
they
live
through
us
again
and
we
through
them
who
wish
for
lips
and
eyes
wherewith
to
feel
not
fancy
the
old
pain
passed
with
reluctance
through
the
centuries
to
us
who
in
the
maze
of
dancing
and
hushed
music
woven
afresh
amid
the
shifting
mirrors
of
hours
and
days
know
not
our
spirit
neither
know
our
flesh
nor
what
ourselves
have
been
through
the
long
way
that
brought
us
to
the
dance
i
see
a
little
green
by
camolin
and
odorous
orchards
blooming
in
provence
two
listen
to
the
roar
of
waves
where
no
steps
intrude
who
knows
what
lips
were
kissed
at
laracor
or
who
it
was
that
walked
through
burnham
wood
when
life
is
real
we
rode
we
rode
against
the
wind
the
countless
lights
along
the
town
made
the
town
blacker
for
their
fire
and
you
were
always
looking
down
to
the
blustering
breath
of
march
or
was
it
for
your
mind
disguise
still
i
could
shut
my
eyes
and
see
the
turquoise
color
of
your
eyes
surely
your
ermine
furs
were
warm
and
warm
your
flowing
cloak
of
red
was
it
the
wild
wind
kept
you
thus
pensive
and
with
averted
head
i
scarcely
spoke
my
words
were
swept
like
winged
things
in
the
wind
despite
we
rode
and
with
what
shadow
speed
across
the
darkness
of
the
night
without
a
word
without
a
look
what
was
the
charm
and
what
the
spell
that
made
one
hour
of
life
become
a
memory
ever
memorable
all
craft
all
labor
all
desire
all
toil
of
age
all
hope
of
youth
are
shadows
from
the
fount
of
fire
and
mummers
of
the
truth
how
bloodless
books
how
pulseless
art
vain
kingly
and
imperial
zeal
vain
all
memorials
of
the
heart
when
life
itself
is
real
we
traced
the
golden
clouds
of
spring
we
roved
the
beach
we
walked
the
land
what
was
the
world
a
phantom
thing
that
vanished
in
your
hand
you
were
as
quiet
as
the
sky
your
eyes
were
liquid
as
the
sea
and
in
that
hour
that
passed
us
by
we
lived
eternally
the
question
i
the
sea
moans
and
the
stars
are
bright
the
leaves
lisp
a
rolling
moon
i
shut
my
eyes
against
the
night
and
make
believe
the
time
is
june
the
june
that
left
us
this
is
the
path
and
this
the
place
we
sat
and
watched
the
moving
sea
and
i
the
moonlight
on
your
face
we
were
not
happy
woe
is
me
happiness
is
but
memory
it
seemeth
now
that
you
are
gone
my
heart
a
measured
pain
doth
keep
are
you
now
as
i
am
alone
do
you
make
merry
do
you
weep
in
whose
arms
are
you
now
asleep
the
answer
ii
i
made
my
bed
beneath
the
pines
where
the
sea
washed
the
sandy
bars
i
heard
the
music
of
the
winds
and
blest
the
aureate
face
of
mars
all
night
a
lilac
splendor
throve
above
the
heaven
shadowy
verge
and
in
my
heart
the
voice
of
love
kept
music
with
the
dreaming
surge
a
little
maid
was
at
my
side
she
slept
i
scarcely
slept
at
all
until
toward
the
a
dream
possessed
me
with
its
thrall
she
sweetly
breathed
around
my
breast
i
felt
her
warmth
like
drowsy
bliss
then
came
the
vision
of
unrest
i
saw
your
face
and
felt
your
kiss
i
woke
and
knew
with
what
dismay
she
read
my
secret
and
surprise
she
only
said
again
is
day
how
red
your
cheeks
how
bright
your
eyes
the
sign
there
not
a
soul
on
the
square
and
the
snow
blows
up
like
a
sail
or
dizzily
drifts
like
a
drunken
man
falling
before
the
gale
and
when
the
wind
eddies
it
rifts
the
snow
that
lies
in
drifts
and
it
skims
along
the
walk
and
sifts
in
stairways
doorways
all
about
the
steps
of
the
church
in
an
angry
rout
and
one
would
think
that
a
hungry
hound
was
out
in
the
cold
for
the
sound
but
i
do
not
seem
to
mind
the
snow
that
makes
one
blind
nor
the
crying
voice
of
the
wind
i
hate
to
hear
the
creak
of
the
sign
of
harmon
whitney
attorney
at
law
with
its
rhythmic
monotone
of
awe
and
neither
a
moan
nor
yet
a
whine
nor
a
cry
of
pain
one
ca
define
the
sound
of
a
creaking
sign
especially
if
the
sky
be
bleak
and
no
one
stirs
however
you
seek
and
every
time
you
hear
it
creak
you
wonder
why
they
leave
it
stay
when
a
man
is
buried
and
hidden
away
many
a
day
william
marion
reedy
he
sits
before
you
silent
as
buddha
and
then
you
say
this
man
is
rabelais
and
while
you
wonder
what
his
stock
is
english
or
irish
you
behold
his
eyes
as
big
and
brown
as
those
desirable
crockies
with
which
as
boys
we
used
to
play
and
then
you
see
the
spherical
light
that
lies
just
under
the
iris
coloring
before
which
everything
becomes
as
plain
as
day
if
you
have
noticed
the
rolling
jowls
and
the
face
that
speaks
its
chief
delight
in
beer
and
roast
beef
before
you
have
seen
his
eyes
you
see
a
man
of
fleshly
jollity
like
the
friars
of
old
in
gowns
and
cowls
to
make
a
show
of
scowls
and
when
he
speaks
from
an
orotund
depth
that
growls
in
a
humorous
way
like
fielding
or
smollett
that
turns
in
a
trice
to
robert
la
follette
or
retraces
to
thales
of
crete
and
touches
upon
descartes
coming
back
through
the
intellectual
zodiac
that
something
of
a
feat
and
you
see
that
the
eyes
are
really
the
man
for
the
thought
of
him
proliferates
this
way
over
to
hindostan
and
that
way
descanting
on
yeats
with
a
word
on
plato
symposium
and
a
little
glimpse
of
theocritus
or
something
of
bruno
martyrdom
or
what
thomas
aquinas
meant
by
a
certain
line
obscure
to
us
and
then
he
take
up
horace
odes
or
the
roman
civilization
or
a
few
of
the
iliad
episodes
or
the
greek
deterioration
or
skip
to
a
word
on
the
plasmic
jelly
which
benjamin
moore
and
others
think
is
the
origin
of
life
then
shelley
comes
in
a
for
a
look
of
understanding
or
he
tell
you
about
the
orientation
of
the
ancient
dream
of
zion
or
what
the
matter
with
bryan
and
while
the
porter
is
bringing
a
drink
something
into
his
fancy
skips
and
he
talks
about
the
apocalypse
or
a
painter
or
writer
now
unknown
in
france
or
germany
who
will
soon
have
fame
of
him
through
the
whole
earth
blown
it
not
so
hard
a
thing
to
be
wise
in
the
lore
of
books
it
a
different
thing
to
be
all
eyes
like
a
lighthouse
which
revolves
and
looks
over
the
land
and
out
to
sea
and
a
lighthouse
is
what
he
seems
to
me
sitting
like
buddha
spiritually
cool
young
as
the
light
of
the
sun
is
young
and
taking
the
even
with
the
odd
as
a
matter
of
course
and
the
path
he
trod
as
a
path
that
was
good
enough
with
a
sort
of
transcendental
sense
whose
hatred
is
less
than
indifference
and
a
gift
of
wisdom
in
love
and
who
can
say
as
he
classifies
men
and
ages
with
his
eyes
with
cool
detachment
this
is
dung
and
that
poor
fellow
is
just
a
fool
and
say
what
you
will
death
is
a
rod
but
i
see
a
light
that
shines
and
shines
and
i
rather
think
it
god
a
study
if
your
thoughts
were
as
clear
as
your
eyes
and
the
whole
of
your
heart
were
true
you
were
fitter
by
far
for
winning
but
then
that
would
not
be
you
if
your
pulse
beat
time
to
love
as
fast
as
you
think
and
plan
you
could
kindle
a
lasting
passion
in
the
breast
of
the
strongest
man
if
you
felt
as
much
as
you
thought
and
dreamed
what
you
seem
to
dream
a
world
of
elysian
beauty
your
ruined
heart
would
redeem
if
you
thought
in
the
light
of
the
sun
or
the
blood
in
your
veins
flowed
free
if
you
gave
your
kisses
but
gladly
we
two
could
better
agree
if
you
were
strong
where
i
counted
and
weak
where
yourself
were
at
stake
you
would
have
my
strength
for
your
giving
you
would
gain
and
not
lose
for
my
sake
if
your
heart
overruled
your
head
or
your
head
were
lord
of
your
heart
or
the
two
were
lovingly
balanced
i
think
we
never
should
part
if
you
came
to
me
spite
of
yourself
and
staid
not
away
through
design
these
days
of
loving
and
living
were
sweet
as
olympian
wine
if
you
could
weep
with
another
and
tears
for
yourself
controlled
you
could
waken
and
hold
to
a
pity
you
waken
but
do
not
hold
if
your
lips
were
as
fain
to
speak
as
your
face
is
fashioned
to
hide
you
would
know
that
to
lay
up
treasure
a
woman
heart
must
confide
if
your
bosom
were
something
richer
or
your
hands
more
fragile
and
thin
you
would
call
what
the
world
calls
evil
or
sin
and
be
glad
of
the
sin
if
your
soul
were
aflame
with
love
or
your
head
were
devoted
to
truth
you
never
would
toss
on
your
pillow
bewildered
rapture
and
ruth
if
you
were
the
you
of
my
dreams
and
the
you
of
my
dreams
were
mine
these
days
half
sweet
and
half
bitter
would
taste
like
olympian
wine
oh
subtle
and
mystic
egyptians
who
chiseled
the
sphinx
in
the
east
with
head
and
the
breasts
of
a
woman
and
body
and
claws
of
a
beast
and
gave
her
a
marvellous
riddle
that
the
eyeless
should
read
as
he
ran
what
crawls
and
runs
and
is
baffled
by
woman
the
sphinx
but
a
man
many
look
in
her
face
and
are
conquered
where
one
all
her
heart
has
explored
a
thousand
have
made
her
their
sovereign
but
one
is
her
sovereign
and
lord
for
him
she
leaps
from
her
standard
and
fawns
at
his
feet
in
the
sand
who
sees
that
himself
is
her
riddle
and
she
but
the
work
of
his
hand
portrait
of
a
woman
the
pathos
in
your
face
is
like
a
peace
it
is
like
resignation
or
a
grace
which
smiles
at
the
surcease
of
hope
but
there
is
in
your
face
the
shadow
of
pain
and
there
is
a
trace
of
memory
of
pain
i
look
at
you
again
and
again
and
hide
my
looks
lest
your
quick
eye
perceives
my
search
for
your
despair
i
look
at
your
pale
hands
i
look
at
your
hair
and
i
watch
you
use
your
hands
i
watch
the
flare
of
thought
in
your
eyes
like
light
that
interweaves
a
flutter
of
color
running
under
leaves
such
anguished
dreams
in
your
eyes
and
i
listen
to
you
speak
words
like
crystals
breaking
with
a
tinkle
or
a
star
twinkle
sometimes
as
we
talk
you
rise
and
leave
the
room
and
then
i
rub
a
streak
of
a
tear
from
my
cheek
you
tell
me
such
magical
things
of
pictures
books
romance
and
of
your
life
in
france
in
the
varied
music
of
exquisite
words
and
in
a
voice
that
sings
all
things
are
memory
now
with
you
for
poverty
girds
your
hopes
and
only
your
dreams
remain
and
sometimes
here
and
there
i
see
as
you
turn
your
head
a
whitened
hair
even
when
you
are
smiling
most
and
a
light
comes
in
your
eyes
like
a
passing
ghost
and
a
color
runs
through
your
cheeks
as
fresh
as
burns
in
a
girl
flesh
then
i
can
shut
my
eyes
and
feel
the
pain
that
has
become
a
part
of
you
though
i
feign
laughter
myself
one
sees
another
bruise
and
shakes
his
thought
out
of
it
shuddering
so
i
turn
and
clamp
my
will
lest
i
bring
your
sorrow
into
my
flesh
who
can
not
choose
but
hear
your
words
and
laughter
and
watch
your
hands
and
eyes
then
as
i
think
you
over
after
i
have
gone
from
you
and
your
face
comes
to
me
with
its
grace
of
memory
of
unfound
love
you
seem
to
me
the
image
of
all
women
who
dream
and
keep
under
smiles
the
grief
thereof
or
sew
or
sit
by
windows
or
read
books
to
hide
their
secret
looks
and
after
a
time
go
out
of
life
and
leave
no
uttered
words
but
in
their
silence
grieve
for
life
and
for
the
things
no
tongue
can
tell
why
life
hurts
so
and
why
love
haunts
and
hurts
poor
men
and
women
in
this
perhaps
your
pathos
means
that
it
is
well
death
in
his
time
the
aspiring
torch
inverts
and
all
tired
flesh
and
haunted
eyes
and
hands
moving
in
painéd
whiteness
are
put
under
the
soothing
earth
to
brighten
april
wonder
in
the
cage
the
sounds
of
trickle
into
the
roar
of
morning
over
the
water
growing
blue
at
ten
the
august
sunbeams
pour
a
blinding
flood
on
michigan
avenue
but
yet
the
shades
of
bottle
green
leave
the
recesses
of
the
room
with
misty
auras
drawn
around
their
gloom
where
things
lie
undistinguished
scarcely
seen
you
standing
between
the
window
and
the
bed
are
edged
with
rainbow
colors
and
i
lie
drowsy
with
quizzical
eye
musing
upon
the
contour
of
your
head
watching
you
comb
your
hair
clothed
in
a
corset
waist
and
skirt
of
silk
tied
with
white
braid
above
your
slender
hips
which
reaches
to
your
knees
and
makes
your
bare
and
delicate
legs
by
contrast
white
as
milk
and
as
you
toss
your
head
to
comb
its
tresses
they
flash
upon
me
like
long
strips
of
sand
between
a
moonlit
sea
pale
as
your
hand
and
a
red
sun
that
on
a
high
dune
stresses
its
sanguine
heat
and
then
at
times
your
lips
protruding
half
unconscious
half
in
scorn
engage
my
eyes
while
looking
through
the
morn
at
the
clear
oval
of
your
brow
brought
full
over
the
sovereign
largeness
of
your
eyes
or
at
your
breasts
that
shake
not
as
you
pull
the
comb
through
stubborn
tangles
only
rise
scarcely
perceptible
with
breath
or
signs
firm
unmaternal
like
a
young
bacchante
or
at
your
nose
profoundly
dipped
like
over
your
chin
that
softly
melts
away
now
you
seem
fully
under
my
heart
sway
i
have
slipped
through
the
magic
of
your
mesh
freed
once
again
and
strengthened
by
your
flesh
you
seem
a
weak
thing
for
a
strong
man
play
yet
i
know
now
that
we
shall
scarce
have
parted
when
i
shall
think
of
you
half
heavy
hearted
i
know
our
partings
you
will
faintly
smile
and
look
at
me
with
eyes
that
have
no
guile
or
have
too
much
and
pass
into
the
sphere
where
you
keep
independent
life
meanwhile
how
do
you
live
without
me
is
the
fear
you
do
not
lean
upon
me
ask
my
love
or
wonder
of
other
loves
i
may
have
hidden
under
these
casual
renewals
of
our
love
and
if
i
loved
you
i
should
lie
in
flame
ari
go
about
your
name
and
these
are
things
a
man
should
be
above
and
as
i
lie
here
on
the
imminent
brink
of
soul
surrender
into
your
soul
power
and
in
the
white
light
of
the
morning
hour
i
see
what
life
would
be
if
we
should
link
our
lives
together
in
a
marriage
pact
for
we
would
walk
along
a
boundless
tract
of
perfect
hell
but
your
disloyalty
would
be
of
spirit
for
i
have
not
won
mastered
and
bound
your
spirit
unto
me
and
if
you
had
a
lover
in
the
way
i
have
you
it
would
not
by
half
betray
my
love
as
does
your
vague
and
chainless
thought
which
wanders
soars
or
vanishes
returns
changes
astonishes
or
chills
or
burns
is
unresisting
plastic
freely
wrought
under
my
hands
yet
to
no
unison
of
my
life
and
of
yours
upon
this
brink
i
watch
you
now
and
think
of
all
that
has
been
preached
or
sung
or
spoken
of
woman
tragedy
in
woman
fall
and
all
the
pictures
of
a
woman
broken
by
man
superior
strength
and
there
you
stand
your
heart
and
life
as
firmly
in
command
of
your
resolve
as
mine
is
knowing
all
of
man
the
master
and
his
power
to
harm
his
rulership
of
spheres
material
bread
customs
rules
of
fair
repute
what
are
they
all
against
your
slender
arm
which
long
since
plucked
the
fruit
of
good
and
evil
and
of
life
at
last
and
now
of
life
for
dancing
you
have
cast
veil
after
veil
of
ideals
or
pretense
with
which
men
clothe
the
being
feminine
to
satisfy
their
lordship
or
their
sense
of
ownership
and
hide
the
things
of
sin
you
have
thrown
them
aside
veil
after
veil
and
there
you
stand
unarmored
weirdly
frail
yet
strong
as
nature
making
comical
the
poems
and
the
tales
of
woman
fall
you
nod
your
head
you
smile
i
feel
the
air
made
by
the
closing
door
i
lie
and
stare
at
the
closed
door
one
two
your
tuftèd
steps
die
on
the
velvet
of
the
outer
hall
you
have
escaped
and
i
would
not
pursue
though
we
are
but
caged
creatures
i
and
you
a
male
and
female
tiger
in
a
zoo
for
i
shall
wait
you
life
himself
will
track
your
wanderings
and
bring
you
back
and
shut
you
up
again
with
me
and
cage
our
love
and
hatred
and
our
silent
rage
saving
a
woman
one
phase
to
a
lustful
thirst
she
came
at
first
and
gave
him
her
maiden
pride
and
the
first
man
scattered
the
flower
of
her
love
then
turned
to
his
chosen
bride
she
waned
with
grief
as
a
fading
star
and
waxed
as
a
shining
flame
and
the
second
man
had
her
woman
love
but
the
second
was
playing
the
game
with
passion
she
stirred
the
man
who
was
third
woe
me
what
delicate
skill
she
plied
to
the
heart
that
knew
her
art
and
fled
from
her
wanton
will
now
calm
and
demure
oh
fair
oh
pure
oh
subtle
patient
and
wise
she
trod
the
weary
round
of
life
with
a
sorrow
deep
in
her
eyes
now
a
hero
who
knew
how
false
how
true
was
the
speech
that
fell
from
her
lips
with
a
norseman
strength
took
sail
with
her
and
landed
and
burnt
his
ships
he
gave
her
pity
he
gave
her
mirth
and
the
hurt
in
her
heart
he
nursed
but
under
the
silence
of
her
brows
was
a
dream
of
the
man
who
was
first
and
all
the
deceit
and
lust
of
men
had
sharpened
her
own
deceit
and
down
to
the
gates
of
hell
she
led
her
friend
with
her
flying
feet
for
a
bitten
bud
will
never
bloom
and
a
woman
lost
is
lost
and
the
first
and
the
third
may
go
unscathed
but
some
man
pays
the
cost
and
the
books
of
life
are
full
of
the
rune
and
this
is
the
truth
of
the
song
no
man
can
save
a
woman
soul
nor
right
a
woman
wrong
love
is
a
madness
love
is
a
madness
love
is
a
fevered
dream
a
white
soul
lost
in
a
field
of
scarlet
flowers
love
is
a
search
for
the
lost
the
ever
vanishing
gleam
of
wings
desires
and
sorrows
and
haunted
hours
will
the
look
return
to
your
eyes
the
warmth
to
your
hand
love
is
a
doubt
an
ache
love
is
a
writhing
fear
love
is
a
potion
drunk
when
the
ship
puts
out
from
land
rudderless
sails
at
full
and
with
none
to
steer
the
end
is
a
shattered
lamp
a
drunken
seraph
asleep
the
upturned
face
of
the
drowned
on
a
barren
beach
the
glare
of
noon
is
us
we
are
ashamed
to
weep
the
beginning
and
end
of
love
are
devoid
of
speech
on
a
bust
your
speeches
seemed
to
answer
for
the
nonce
they
do
not
justify
your
head
in
bronze
your
essays
talent
failures
were
to
you
your
philosophic
gamut
but
things
true
or
beautiful
oh
never
what
the
pons
for
you
to
cross
to
fame
your
head
in
bronze
what
has
the
artist
caught
the
sensual
chin
that
melts
away
in
weakness
from
the
skin
sagging
from
your
indifference
of
mind
the
sullen
mouth
that
sneers
at
human
kind
for
lack
of
genius
to
create
or
rule
the
superficial
scorn
that
says
you
fool
the
eyes
that
have
the
look
which
might
belong
to
tolstoi
or
a
crook
the
nose
fleshed
and
half
in
point
and
lightly
turned
awry
as
out
of
joint
the
eyebrows
pointing
upward
scarce
like
mephisto
for
you
scarcely
rise
to
cosmic
irony
in
what
you
dream
more
like
a
tomcat
sniffing
yellow
cream
the
brow
is
worth
the
bronze
it
molded
in
save
for
the
head
and
narrow
thin
backhead
which
shows
your
spirit
has
not
soared
you
are
a
packard
engine
in
a
ford
which
wrecks
itself
and
turtles
with
its
load
too
light
and
powerful
to
keep
the
road
the
master
strength
for
twisting
words
is
caught
in
the
swift
turning
wheels
of
iron
thought
with
butcher
knives
your
hands
can
vivisect
our
butterflies
but
you
can
not
erect
temples
of
beauty
wisdom
you
can
crawl
hungry
and
subtle
over
eden
wall
and
shame
half
grown
up
truth
or
make
a
lie
full
grown
as
good
you
can
not
glorify
our
dreams
or
aspirations
or
deep
thirst
to
you
the
world
a
fig
tree
which
is
curst
you
have
preached
every
faith
but
to
betray
the
artist
shows
us
you
have
had
your
day
a
giant
as
we
hoped
in
truth
a
dwarf
a
barrel
of
slop
that
shines
on
lethe
wharf
which
seemed
at
first
a
vessel
with
sweet
wine
for
thirsty
lips
so
down
the
swift
decline
you
went
through
sloven
spirit
craven
heart
and
cynic
indolence
and
here
the
art
of
molding
clay
has
caught
you
for
the
nonce
and
made
your
shame
our
shame
your
head
in
bronze
some
day
this
bust
will
lie
amid
old
metals
old
copper
boilers
wires
faucets
kettles
some
day
it
will
be
melted
up
and
molded
in
door
knobs
inkwells
paper
knives
or
folded
in
leaves
and
wreaths
around
the
capitals
of
marble
columns
or
for
arsenals
fashioned
in
something
or
in
course
of
time
successively
made
each
of
these
from
grime
rescued
successively
or
made
a
bell
for
fire
or
worship
who
on
earth
can
tell
one
thing
is
sure
you
will
not
long
be
dust
when
this
bronze
will
be
broken
as
a
bust
and
given
to
the
junkman
to
you
know
this
and
the
thought
of
it
is
hell
arabel
twists
of
smoke
rise
from
the
limpness
of
jewelled
fingers
the
softness
of
persian
rugs
hushes
the
room
under
a
dragon
lamp
with
a
shade
the
color
of
coral
sit
the
readers
of
poems
one
by
one
and
all
the
room
is
in
shadow
except
for
the
blur
of
mahogany
surface
and
tapers
against
the
wall
and
a
youth
reads
a
poem
of
love
forever
and
ever
is
his
soul
the
soul
of
the
loved
one
a
woman
sings
of
the
nine
months
which
go
to
the
birth
of
a
soul
and
after
a
time
under
the
lamp
a
man
begins
to
read
a
letter
having
no
poem
to
read
and
the
words
of
the
letter
flash
and
die
like
a
fuse
dampened
by
rain
it
a
dying
mind
that
writes
what
byron
did
for
the
greeks
against
the
turks
and
a
sickness
enters
our
hearts
the
jewelled
hands
clutch
at
the
arms
of
the
chairs
about
the
room
one
hears
the
parting
of
lips
and
a
nervous
shifting
of
feet
and
arms
and
i
look
up
and
over
the
reader
shoulder
and
see
the
name
of
the
writer
what
is
it
i
see
the
name
of
a
man
i
knew
you
are
an
ironical
trickster
time
to
bring
after
so
many
years
and
into
a
place
like
this
this
face
before
me
hair
slicked
down
and
parted
in
the
middle
and
cheeks
stuck
out
with
fatness
plump
from
camembert
and
clicquot
eyelids
thin
as
skins
of
onions
cut
like
dough
the
eyes
such
was
your
look
in
a
photograph
i
saw
in
a
silver
frame
on
a
woman
dresser
and
such
your
look
in
life
you
thing
of
flesh
alone
and
then
as
a
soul
looks
down
on
the
body
it
leaves
a
body
by
fever
slain
i
look
on
myself
as
i
was
a
decade
ago
while
the
letter
is
read
i
enter
a
box
of
a
theater
with
jim
my
friend
of
fifty
i
being
two
women
are
in
the
box
one
of
an
age
for
jim
and
one
of
an
age
for
me
and
mine
is
dressed
in
a
dainty
gown
of
dimity
and
she
fans
herself
with
a
fan
of
silver
spangles
till
a
subtle
odor
of
delicate
powder
or
of
herself
enters
my
blood
and
i
stare
at
her
snowy
neck
and
the
glossy
brownness
of
her
hair
until
she
feels
my
stare
and
turns
and
i
see
how
like
a
greek
is
her
nose
with
just
a
little
aquiline
touch
and
i
catch
the
flash
of
an
eye
and
the
glint
of
a
smile
on
the
richness
of
her
lips
the
company
now
discourses
upon
the
letter
but
my
dream
goes
on
i
a
rapture
which
may
be
madness
and
no
man
understands
until
he
feels
it
no
more
the
youth
that
was
i
from
the
theater
under
the
city
lights
follows
the
girl
desperate
lest
in
the
city
curious
chances
he
never
sees
her
again
and
boldly
he
speaks
and
she
and
the
older
woman
her
sister
smile
and
speak
in
turn
and
jim
who
stands
while
i
break
the
ice
comes
up
and
so
arm
in
arm
we
go
to
the
restaurant
i
in
heaven
walking
with
arabel
and
jim
with
her
older
sister
we
drive
them
home
under
a
summer
moon
and
while
i
explain
to
arabel
my
boldness
and
crave
her
pardon
for
it
jim
the
devil
laughs
apart
with
her
sister
while
i
wonder
what
jim
the
devil
is
laughing
at
no
matter
i
walk
in
the
park
with
arabel
just
now
the
reader
of
the
letter
tells
of
the
writer
swift
descent
from
wealth
to
want
we
are
in
the
park
next
afternoon
by
the
water
i
look
at
her
white
throat
full
as
it
were
of
song
and
her
rounded
virginal
bosom
beautiful
and
i
study
her
eyes
i
search
to
the
depths
her
eyes
in
the
light
of
the
sun
they
are
full
of
little
rays
like
the
edge
of
a
fleur
de
lys
and
she
smiles
at
first
when
i
fling
my
soul
at
her
feet
but
when
i
repeat
i
love
her
love
her
only
a
cloud
of
wonder
passes
over
her
face
she
veils
her
eyes
the
color
comes
to
her
cheeks
and
when
she
picks
some
clover
blossoms
and
tears
them
her
hand
is
trembling
and
when
i
tell
her
again
i
love
her
love
her
only
she
blots
her
eyes
with
a
handkerchief
to
hide
a
tear
that
starts
and
she
says
to
me
you
do
not
know
me
at
all
how
can
you
love
me
you
never
saw
me
before
last
night
well
tell
me
about
yourself
and
after
a
time
she
tells
me
the
story
about
her
father
who
ran
away
from
her
mother
and
how
she
hated
her
father
and
how
she
grieved
when
her
mother
died
and
how
a
good
grandmother
helped
her
and
helps
her
now
and
how
her
sister
divorced
her
husband
and
then
she
paused
a
moment
i
am
not
strong
you
have
to
guard
me
gently
and
that
takes
money
dear
as
well
as
love
two
years
ago
i
was
very
ill
and
since
then
i
am
not
strong
well
i
can
work
i
said
and
what
would
you
think
of
a
little
cottage
not
too
far
out
with
a
yard
and
hosts
of
roses
and
a
vine
on
the
porch
and
a
little
garden
and
a
dining
room
where
the
sun
comes
in
when
a
morning
breeze
blows
over
your
brow
and
you
sit
across
the
table
and
serve
me
and
neither
of
us
can
speak
for
happiness
without
our
voices
breaking
or
lips
trembling
she
is
looking
down
with
little
frowns
on
her
brow
but
if
ever
i
had
to
work
i
could
not
do
it
i
am
not
really
well
but
i
can
work
i
said
i
rise
and
lift
her
up
holding
her
hand
she
slips
her
arm
through
mine
and
presses
it
what
a
good
man
you
are
she
said
just
like
a
brother
i
almost
love
you
i
believe
i
love
you
the
reader
of
the
letter
being
a
doctor
is
talking
learnedly
of
the
writer
case
which
has
the
classical
marks
of
paresis
next
day
i
look
up
jim
and
rhapsodize
about
a
cottage
with
roses
and
a
garden
and
a
dining
room
where
the
sun
comes
in
and
arabel
across
the
table
jim
is
smoking
and
flicking
the
ashes
but
never
says
a
word
till
i
have
finished
then
in
a
quiet
voice
arabel
sister
says
that
arabel
straight
but
she
is
my
boy
she
just
like
arabel
sister
she
knew
you
had
the
madness
for
arabel
that
why
we
laughed
and
stood
apart
as
we
talked
and
i
tell
you
now
i
did
go
home
that
night
i
shook
you
at
the
corner
and
went
back
and
staid
that
night
now
be
a
man
my
boy
go
have
your
fling
with
arabel
but
drop
the
cottage
and
the
roses
they
are
still
discussing
the
madman
letter
and
memory
permeates
me
like
a
subtle
drug
the
memory
of
my
love
for
arabel
the
torture
the
doubt
the
fear
the
restless
longing
the
sleepless
nights
the
pity
for
all
her
sorrows
the
speculation
about
her
and
her
sister
and
what
her
illness
was
and
whether
the
man
i
saw
one
time
was
leaving
her
door
or
the
next
door
to
it
and
if
her
door
whether
he
saw
my
arabel
or
her
sister
the
reader
of
the
letter
is
telling
how
the
writer
left
his
wife
chasing
the
lure
of
women
and
it
all
comes
back
to
me
as
clear
as
a
vision
the
night
i
sat
with
arabel
strong
but
conquered
whatever
i
did
i
loved
her
whatever
she
was
madness
or
love
the
terrible
struggle
must
end
she
took
my
hand
and
said
you
must
see
my
room
we
stood
in
the
doorway
together
and
on
her
dresser
was
a
silver
frame
with
the
photograph
of
a
man
i
had
seen
him
in
life
hair
slicked
down
and
parted
in
the
middle
and
cheeks
stuck
out
with
fatness
plump
from
camembert
and
clicquot
eyelids
thin
as
skins
of
onions
cut
like
dough
the
eyes
there
is
his
picture
she
said
ask
me
whatever
you
will
take
me
as
mistress
or
wife
it
is
yours
to
decide
but
take
me
as
mistress
and
grow
like
the
picture
before
you
take
me
as
wife
and
be
the
good
man
you
can
be
choose
me
as
mistress
how
can
i
do
less
for
dearest
or
make
me
your
wife
fate
makes
me
your
mistress
or
wife
i
can
leave
you
i
said
you
can
leave
me
she
echoed
but
how
about
hate
in
your
heart
you
are
right
i
replied
the
company
is
now
discussing
the
subject
of
love
they
seem
to
know
little
about
it
but
my
wife
who
is
sitting
beside
me
exclaims
well
what
is
this
jangle
of
madness
and
weakness
what
has
it
to
do
with
poetry
tell
me
well
it
life
arabel
there
the
story
of
hamlet
for
instance
i
added
then
fell
into
silence
jim
and
arabel
sister
last
night
a
friend
of
mine
and
i
sat
talking
when
all
at
once
i
found
was
one
so
we
came
out
and
he
went
home
to
wife
and
children
and
i
started
for
the
club
which
i
call
home
and
then
just
like
a
flash
you
came
into
my
mind
i
bought
a
slug
and
stood
in
the
booth
with
doubtful
heart
and
heard
the
buzzer
buzz
well
it
was
sweet
to
me
to
hear
your
voice
at
last
it
was
so
drowsy
like
a
child
voice
and
i
could
see
your
eyes
heavy
with
sleep
and
i
could
see
you
standing
in
nightgown
with
head
leaned
against
the
wall
julia
the
welcome
of
your
drowsy
voice
went
through
me
like
the
warmth
of
priceless
wine
it
showed
your
understanding
that
you
know
how
it
is
with
a
man
and
how
it
is
with
me
who
work
by
day
and
sometimes
drift
by
night
about
this
hellish
city
though
you
know
that
i
am
can
you
imagine
my
feeling
with
no
children
growing
up
my
feeling
as
of
one
who
sees
a
play
and
afterwards
sits
somewhere
at
a
table
and
talks
with
friends
about
the
different
parts
over
a
sandwich
and
a
glass
of
beer
my
feeling
with
this
money
which
i
made
and
can
not
use
sometimes
the
stress
of
working
the
money
dulls
the
fancy
which
could
use
it
in
splendid
dreams
or
in
the
art
of
life
well
here
was
i
ringing
your
bell
at
last
at
one
and
there
you
stood
before
me
with
a
sleepy
voice
and
a
sleepy
smile
with
hands
so
warm
and
cheeks
so
red
from
sleep
not
vexed
but
like
a
child
awakened
who
smiles
at
you
with
eyes
and
kisses
you
so
you
gave
me
a
kiss
the
world
seems
better
julia
for
that
kiss
which
you
gave
me
at
the
door
breakfast
why
toast
and
coffee
not
too
strong
my
heart
acts
queer
of
late
i
want
to
say
lest
i
forget
it
if
you
ever
hear
from
arabel
or
francis
what
i
said
to
francis
when
he
told
me
he
intended
to
marry
arabel
why
just
remember
our
talk
this
morning
and
forget
i
said
it
i
sorry
that
i
said
it
but
you
see
that
night
we
met
i
being
and
old
at
what
men
call
the
game
looked
on
with
steady
eye
and
quiet
nerve
i
saw
you
just
as
i
see
a
woman
anywhere
and
i
found
you
as
i
found
others
before
you
but
with
this
difference
so
it
seemed
to
me
what
had
been
false
with
them
was
real
with
you
what
had
been
shame
with
them
with
you
was
life
what
had
been
craft
with
them
with
you
was
nature
what
had
been
sin
with
them
to
you
was
good
what
had
been
vice
with
them
to
you
the
honest
and
uncorrupted
innocence
of
a
human
heart
so
human
looking
on
our
souls
what
had
been
coarse
to
them
to
you
was
clean
as
rain
is
or
fresh
flowers
all
things
that
grow
and
move
and
sing
along
creation
way
you
came
to
me
like
friendship
what
you
gave
was
friendship
gift
when
friends
think
least
of
self
and
least
of
motive
and
it
is
through
you
that
i
have
risen
out
of
the
pit
where
sneers
and
laughter
looks
and
words
obscene
blaspheme
our
nature
it
is
through
you
julia
as
one
amid
great
beach
trees
where
soft
mosses
pillow
our
heads
and
where
we
see
the
clouds
upon
their
infinite
sailings
and
the
lake
washes
beneath
us
and
we
lie
and
think
how
this
has
been
forever
and
will
be
when
we
are
dust
a
thousand
thousand
years
yet
how
life
is
eternal
just
as
one
who
there
falls
into
prayer
for
ecstasy
of
wonder
prophecy
could
not
blaspheme
the
eternal
power
as
he
might
well
blaspheme
the
gospel
hymns
and
ritual
that
i
can
not
blaspheme
you
julia
for
what
is
our
communion
yours
and
mine
if
it
be
not
a
way
of
laying
hold
on
that
mysterious
essence
which
makes
one
of
heaven
and
earth
makes
kindred
human
hands
tears
are
not
like
you
julia
laugh
that
right
pour
me
a
little
coffee
if
you
please
i
take
from
my
herbarium
certain
species
to
make
my
points
now
here
there
is
the
woman
of
life
promiscuous
or
nearly
so
she
fixes
her
design
upon
a
man
who
married
and
the
riotous
game
begins
they
go
along
a
year
or
two
perhaps
then
psychic
chemistry
performs
its
part
they
are
in
love
or
he
in
love
with
her
what
shall
be
done
with
love
now
watch
the
woman
that
which
she
gave
without
love
at
the
first
she
now
withdraws
in
spite
of
love
unless
he
breaks
his
life
up
cuts
all
former
ties
and
weds
her
do
you
wonder
sometimes
men
kill
women
with
a
knife
or
strangle
them
well
here
another
she
has
been
to
ogontz
you
meet
her
at
a
we
say
she
has
green
eyes
and
hair
as
light
as
jonquils
she
wears
black
velvet
and
a
salmon
sash
and
when
you
dance
with
her
she
has
a
way
of
giving
you
her
flesh
beneath
thin
silk
which
almost
lisps
as
she
caresses
you
with
legs
that
scarcely
touch
you
and
she
says
things
with
a
double
meaning
and
she
smiles
to
carry
out
her
meaning
well
you
think
the
girl
is
yours
and
after
weeks
of
chasing
she
lands
you
up
at
the
appointed
place
with
mamma
who
looks
at
you
with
big
eyes
that
have
a
nervous
way
of
opening
and
closing
slowly
like
a
big
wax
doll
from
which
great
clouds
of
wrath
and
wonder
come
which
meeting
is
a
way
of
saying
to
you
the
girl
is
yours
if
you
will
marry
her
and
let
her
have
your
money
julia
be
still
i
ca
go
on
while
you
are
laughing
so
i
know
that
men
are
easy
but
to
see
women
as
women
see
them
is
a
gift
that
comes
to
men
who
reach
my
age
in
life
well
here
another
here
the
type
of
woman
whose
power
of
motherhood
conceals
the
art
by
which
she
thrives
through
which
she
reaches
also
an
apotheosis
in
society
her
dream
is
children
conscious
or
unconscious
and
her
strength
is
the
race
and
she
draws
the
urgings
of
posterity
and
leans
upon
the
hopes
and
ideals
of
the
day
to
her
a
man
must
sacrifice
his
life
but
women
julia
of
whatever
type
are
still
but
waiting
ovules
seeking
man
and
man
life
to
develop
even
to
live
and
like
the
praying
mantis
who
devoured
in
the
embrace
man
is
devoured
by
women
in
some
way
by
some
sort
love
is
a
flame
in
man
life
where
he
warms
him
but
to
suck
the
invisible
heat
and
perish
life
is
cramped
bound
down
with
many
ropes
shut
in
by
gates
love
is
not
free
which
should
be
wholly
free
for
life
sake
on
michigan
avenue
at
lunch
time
or
at
five
you
see
in
rain
or
shine
a
certain
tailor
walk
in
modish
coat
and
trousers
with
a
cane
that
fellow
is
the
pitifulest
man
i
know
he
has
no
woman
can
not
find
a
woman
because
all
women
seeing
him
divine
what
surges
through
him
and
within
their
hearts
laugh
slyly
and
deny
him
for
the
fun
of
seeing
how
denial
keeps
him
walking
all
up
and
down
the
boulevard
he
found
no
hand
of
human
friendship
like
yours
julia
i
use
him
for
my
point
if
we
could
make
some
fine
erotometer
one
could
sit
and
watch
its
trembling
springs
and
nervous
hands
record
the
waves
of
longing
in
the
city
and
the
urge
of
life
that
writhes
beneath
the
blows
of
custom
and
of
fear
love
is
not
free
which
should
be
wholly
free
for
life
sake
julia
so
much
for
all
these
things
and
now
for
you
to
whom
they
lead
you
find
among
the
marshes
the
sundew
and
the
pitcher
plant
in
shallows
where
the
green
scum
floats
languidly
you
find
the
water
lily
with
white
petals
and
a
sickly
perfume
but
the
sundew
catches
the
midges
flitting
by
with
rainbow
wings
impales
them
on
its
tiny
spines
in
time
devours
them
and
the
pitcher
plant
holds
out
its
cup
of
green
for
larger
bugs
which
fall
into
the
water
treasured
there
like
tears
of
women
and
so
drowned
are
soon
absorbed
into
the
verdant
vesture
of
its
leaves
the
pitcher
plant
and
sundew
water
lily
well
typify
the
nature
of
most
women
who
must
have
blood
or
soul
of
man
to
live
except
you
julia
for
my
friend
at
hinsdale
who
raises
flowers
laid
out
a
primrose
bed
he
read
somewhere
that
primroses
will
change
under
your
eyes
sometimes
to
something
else
become
another
flower
and
not
a
primrose
another
species
even
so
he
watched
and
saw
it
saw
this
miracle
the
seed
has
somewhere
in
its
vital
self
the
power
of
this
mutation
what
is
the
origin
of
spiritual
species
for
you
a
primrose
julia
who
has
mutated
you
are
not
a
mother
nor
are
you
yet
the
woman
seeking
marriage
nor
yet
the
woman
thriving
by
her
sex
nor
yet
the
woman
spoken
of
by
solomon
who
waits
and
watches
and
whose
steps
lead
down
to
death
and
hell
nor
yet
delilah
who
rejoices
in
the
secret
of
man
strength
and
in
subduing
it
you
are
a
flower
designed
to
comfort
such
poor
men
as
i
and
show
the
world
how
love
can
be
a
thing
that
asks
no
more
than
what
it
freely
gives
and
gives
all
all
some
women
call
the
prize
for
life
or
honor
riches
power
or
place
you
are
a
blossom
in
the
primrose
bed
so
raised
to
subtler
color
sweeter
scent
you
have
mutated
julia
that
is
it
this
flower
of
you
is
what
i
call
the
sorrow
of
dead
faces
i
have
seen
many
faces
changed
by
the
sculptor
death
but
never
a
face
like
harold
who
passed
in
a
throe
of
pain
there
were
maidens
and
youths
in
the
bud
and
men
in
the
lust
of
life
and
women
whom
racked
till
the
crying
soul
slipped
through
patriarchs
withered
with
age
and
nuns
ascetical
white
and
one
who
wasted
her
virgin
wealth
in
a
riot
of
joy
brothers
and
sisters
at
last
in
a
quiet
and
purple
pall
fellow
voyagers
bound
to
a
port
on
an
sea
locked
in
an
utterless
grief
in
a
mystery
fearful
to
dream
all
of
these
i
have
seen
but
the
face
of
harold
the
bold
looked
with
a
penitent
pallor
and
stared
with
a
sad
surprise
for
now
at
last
he
was
still
who
never
knew
rest
in
life
and
the
ardent
heat
of
his
blood
was
cold
as
the
sweat
of
a
stone
life
came
in
an
evil
hour
and
stabbed
with
a
poisoned
word
the
heart
of
a
girl
who
faintly
smiled
through
her
tears
and
her
little
life
was
tossed
as
the
eddies
that
whirl
in
the
hollows
from
the
great
that
wreck
the
battle
ships
at
sea
and
the
face
of
dead
lillian
seemed
like
a
flower
or
what
is
writ
on
the
brow
of
the
babe
as
the
mother
wails
for
the
day
when
it
leaped
in
the
light
of
the
sun
and
babbled
its
pure
delight
but
the
face
of
william
the
great
was
fashioned
by
life
and
thought
and
death
made
it
massive
as
bronze
and
deepened
the
lines
thereof
some
for
the
will
and
some
for
patience
and
some
for
hope
hope
for
the
weal
of
the
world
wherein
he
mightily
strove
yet
what
did
it
all
bespeak
what
but
submission
and
awe
and
a
trace
of
pain
as
one
with
a
sword
in
his
side
i
have
seen
many
faces
changed
by
the
sculptor
death
but
the
sorrow
thereof
is
dumb
like
the
cloth
that
lies
on
the
brow
so
what
should
be
said
of
the
faun
surprised
in
the
woodland
dances
of
harold
the
light
of
heart
who
fought
with
fear
to
the
last
the
cry
there
a
voice
in
my
heart
that
cries
and
cries
for
tears
it
is
not
a
voice
but
a
pain
of
many
fears
it
is
not
a
pain
but
the
rune
of
spheres
it
may
be
a
dæmon
of
pent
and
high
emprise
that
looks
on
my
soul
till
my
soul
hides
and
cries
loath
to
rebuke
my
soul
and
bid
it
arise
it
may
be
myself
as
i
was
in
another
life
fashioned
to
lead
where
strife
gives
way
to
strife
pinioned
here
in
failure
by
knife
thrown
after
knife
the
child
turns
in
the
womb
and
perhaps
the
soul
nurtures
a
dream
too
strong
for
the
soul
control
when
the
dream
hath
eyes
and
senses
its
destined
goal
deep
in
darkness
the
bulb
under
mould
and
clod
feels
the
sun
in
the
sky
and
pushes
above
the
sod
perhaps
this
cry
in
my
heart
is
nothing
but
god
the
helping
hand
mother
my
head
is
bloody
my
breast
is
red
with
scars
well
foolish
son
i
told
you
so
why
went
you
to
the
wars
mother
my
soul
is
crucified
my
thirst
is
past
belief
how
are
you
crucified
my
son
betwixt
a
thief
and
thief
mother
i
feel
the
terror
and
the
loveliness
of
life
tell
me
of
the
children
son
and
tell
me
of
the
wife
mother
your
face
is
but
a
face
among
a
million
more
you
standing
on
the
deck
my
son
and
looking
at
the
shore
i
lean
against
the
wall
mother
and
struggle
hard
for
breath
you
must
have
heard
the
step
my
son
of
the
patrolman
death
mother
my
soul
is
weary
where
is
the
way
to
god
well
kiss
the
crucifix
my
son
and
pass
beneath
the
rod
the
door
this
is
the
room
that
thou
wast
ushered
in
wouldst
thou
perchance
a
larger
freedom
win
wouldst
thou
escape
for
deeper
or
no
breath
there
is
no
door
but
death
do
shadows
crouch
within
the
mocking
light
stand
thou
but
if
thy
terrored
heart
takes
flight
facing
maimed
hope
and
nevermore
there
is
no
less
one
door
dost
thou
bewail
love
end
and
friendship
doom
the
dying
fire
drained
cup
and
gathering
gloom
explore
the
walls
if
thy
soul
ventureth
there
is
no
door
but
death
there
is
no
window
heaven
hangs
aloof
above
the
rents
within
the
stairless
roof
hence
soul
be
brave
across
the
ruined
floor
who
knocks
unbolt
the
door
supplication
he
knoweth
our
frame
he
remembereth
that
we
are
psalm
ciii
oh
lord
when
all
our
bones
are
thrust
beyond
the
gaze
of
all
but
thine
and
these
blaspheming
tongues
are
dust
which
babbled
of
thy
name
divine
how
helpless
then
to
carp
or
rail
against
the
canons
of
thy
word
wilt
thou
when
thus
our
spirits
fail
have
mercy
lord
here
from
this
ebon
speck
that
floats
as
but
a
mote
within
thine
eye
vain
sneers
and
curses
from
our
throats
rise
to
the
vault
of
thy
fair
sky
yet
when
this
world
of
ours
is
still
of
this
tortured
horde
and
none
is
left
for
thee
to
kill
have
mercy
lord
thou
knowest
that
our
flesh
is
grass
ah
let
our
withered
souls
remain
like
stricken
reeds
of
some
morass
bleached
in
thy
will
by
ceaseless
rain
have
we
not
had
enough
of
fire
enough
of
torment
and
the
sword
if
these
accrue
from
thy
desire
have
mercy
lord
dost
thou
not
see
about
our
feet
the
tangles
of
our
erring
thought
thou
knowest
that
we
run
to
greet
high
hopes
that
vanish
into
naught
we
bleed
we
fall
we
rise
again
how
can
we
be
of
thee
abhorred
we
are
thy
breed
we
little
men
have
mercy
lord
wilt
thou
then
slay
for
that
we
slay
wilt
thou
deny
when
we
deny
a
thousand
years
are
but
a
day
a
little
day
within
thine
eye
we
thirst
for
love
we
yearn
for
life
we
lust
wilt
thou
the
lust
record
we
beaten
fall
upon
the
knife
have
mercy
lord
thou
givest
us
youth
that
turns
to
age
and
strength
that
leaves
us
while
we
seek
thou
pourest
the
fire
of
sacred
rage
in
costly
vessels
all
too
weak
great
works
we
planned
in
hopes
that
thou
fit
wisdom
therefor
wouldst
accord
thou
wrotest
failure
on
our
brow
have
mercy
lord
could
we
but
know
as
thou
dost
know
hold
the
whole
scheme
at
once
in
mind
yet
dost
thou
watch
our
anxious
woe
who
piece
with
palsied
hands
and
blind
the
fragments
of
our
little
plan
to
thrive
and
earn
thy
blest
reward
and
make
and
keep
the
world
of
man
have
mercy
lord
thou
settest
the
sun
within
his
place
to
light
the
world
the
world
is
thine
put
in
our
hands
and
through
thy
grace
to
be
subdued
and
made
divine
whether
we
serve
thee
ill
or
well
thou
knowest
our
frame
nor
canst
afford
to
leave
thy
own
for
long
in
hell
have
mercy
lord
the
conversation
human
you
knew
then
starting
let
us
say
with
ether
you
would
become
electrons
out
of
whirling
would
rise
to
atoms
then
as
an
atom
resting
till
through
yourself
in
other
atoms
moving
and
by
the
fine
affinity
of
power
atom
with
atom
massed
you
would
go
on
over
the
crest
of
visible
forms
transformed
would
be
a
molecule
a
little
system
wherein
the
atoms
move
like
suns
and
planets
with
satellites
electrons
so
as
worlds
build
from
as
electron
to
electron
the
same
attraction
drawing
molecules
would
wed
and
pass
over
the
crest
again
of
visible
forms
lying
content
as
crystals
or
colloids
ready
now
to
use
the
gleam
of
life
as
i
see
you
with
a
match
as
one
in
darkness
lights
a
candle
and
one
sees
not
his
friend
form
in
the
shadowed
room
until
the
candle
lighted
even
his
form
is
darkened
by
the
light
he
stands
so
near
it
well
i
add
to
all
i
asked
whether
you
knew
the
cell
born
to
the
glint
of
that
same
lighted
candle
would
not
rest
even
as
electrons
rest
not
but
would
surge
over
the
crest
of
visible
forms
become
beneath
our
feet
things
hidden
from
the
eye
however
aided
as
above
our
heads
beyond
the
milky
way
great
systems
whirl
beyond
the
telescope
become
bacilli
amoeba
starfish
swimming
things
on
land
the
serpent
and
then
birds
and
beasts
of
prey
the
tiger
you
in
the
tiger
on
and
on
surging
above
the
crest
of
visible
forms
until
the
ape
came
oh
what
ages
they
are
to
us
but
still
creation
flies
on
wings
of
light
then
to
the
man
who
roamed
the
frozen
fields
neither
man
nor
ape
we
found
his
jaw
you
know
at
heidelberg
in
a
on
and
on
till
babylon
was
builded
and
arose
jerusalem
and
memphis
athens
rome
venice
and
florence
paris
london
berlin
new
york
chicago
did
you
know
i
ask
all
this
would
come
of
you
in
ether
moving
i
knew
human
you
knew
that
man
was
born
to
be
destroyed
that
as
an
atom
perfect
whole
at
ease
drawn
to
some
other
atom
is
broken
changed
and
rises
the
crest
of
visible
things
to
something
else
that
man
must
pass
as
well
through
equal
transformation
and
you
knew
the
unutterable
things
of
man
life
from
the
first
you
saw
his
wracked
that
looks
backward
on
life
that
rises
where
he
rose
out
of
the
stones
you
saw
him
looking
forward
over
the
purple
mists
that
hide
the
gulf
ere
the
green
cell
rose
even
in
the
green
cell
you
saw
the
sequences
of
thought
you
saw
that
one
would
say
all
matter
and
another
all
mind
and
man
mind
which
reflects
the
image
could
not
envision
it
that
even
worship
of
what
you
are
would
be
confused
by
cries
from
india
or
palestine
that
love
which
sees
itself
beginning
in
the
seeds
which
fly
and
seek
each
other
maims
the
soul
at
the
last
in
loss
of
child
or
friend
father
or
mother
and
you
knew
that
sex
ranging
from
plants
through
beasts
and
up
to
us
had
ties
of
filth
and
out
of
them
would
rise
diverse
philosophies
to
tear
the
world
you
knew
when
the
green
cell
arose
that
even
the
you
which
formed
it
moving
on
would
bring
races
and
breeds
madmen
tyrants
slaves
the
idiot
child
the
murderer
the
insane
all
springing
from
the
action
of
one
law
you
knew
the
enmity
that
lies
between
the
lives
of
and
our
own
you
knew
how
man
would
rise
to
vision
of
himself
immortal
only
in
the
race
life
and
past
the
atom
and
the
first
glint
of
life
saw
him
with
soul
enraptured
yet
amid
i
knew
but
this
your
fault
you
see
me
as
apart
over
removed
at
enmity
with
you
you
are
in
me
and
of
me
even
at
one
with
me
but
there
your
soul
your
soul
may
be
the
germinal
cell
of
vaster
evolution
why
try
to
tell
you
if
i
gave
a
cell
voice
to
inquire
and
it
should
ask
you
this
after
me
what
a
stalk
a
flower
life
that
swims
or
crawls
and
if
i
gave
to
you
wisdom
to
say
you
shall
become
a
reed
by
the
water
edge
how
could
the
cell
foresee
what
the
reed
is
bending
beneath
the
wind
when
the
lake
ripples
and
the
skies
are
blue
as
larkspur
therefore
i
who
moved
in
darkness
becoming
light
in
suns
and
light
in
souls
and
mind
with
thought
for
what
is
thought
but
light
sprung
from
the
clash
of
ether
i
am
with
you
and
if
beyond
this
stable
state
that
stands
for
your
life
here
as
cells
are
whole
and
balanced
till
the
inner
urge
bring
union
then
a
breaking
and
building
up
to
higher
life
there
is
no
memory
of
this
world
nor
of
your
thought
nor
sense
of
life
on
this
world
lived
and
borne
or
whether
you
remember
know
yourself
as
one
who
lived
here
suffered
here
aspired
what
does
it
matter
you
can
not
be
lost
as
i
am
lost
not
therefore
be
at
peace
and
from
the
laws
whose
orbits
cross
and
run
to
seeming
tangles
find
the
law
through
which
your
soul
shall
be
perfected
till
it
draw
as
the
green
cell
the
sunlight
draws
and
turns
its
chemical
effulgence
into
life
my
inner
splendor
all
the
rest
is
mine
in
infinite
time
for
if
i
should
unroll
the
parchment
of
the
future
it
were
vain
you
could
not
read
it
terminus
terminus
shows
the
ways
and
says
all
things
must
have
an
end
oh
bitter
thought
we
hid
away
when
first
you
were
my
friend
we
hid
it
in
the
darkest
place
our
hearts
had
place
to
hide
and
took
the
sweet
as
from
a
spring
whose
waters
would
abide
for
neither
life
nor
the
wide
world
has
greater
store
than
this
the
thought
that
runs
through
hands
and
eyes
and
fills
the
silences
there
is
a
void
the
agéd
world
throws
over
the
spent
heart
when
life
has
given
all
she
has
and
terminus
says
depart
when
we
must
sit
with
folded
hands
and
see
with
inward
eye
a
void
rise
like
an
arctic
breath
to
hollow
the
morrow
sky
is
and
trembling
leaves
and
winds
from
thrace
look
for
you
where
your
face
has
bloomed
and
where
may
bloom
your
face
beyond
the
city
over
the
hill
under
the
anguished
moon
the
winds
and
my
dreams
seek
after
you
by
meadow
water
and
dune
all
things
must
have
an
end
we
know
but
oh
the
dreaded
end
whether
in
life
whether
in
death
to
lose
the
cherished
friend
to
lose
in
life
the
cherished
friend
while
the
myrtle
tree
is
green
to
live
and
have
the
cherished
friend
with
only
the
world
between
with
only
the
wide
wide
world
between
where
memory
has
mortmain
life
pours
more
wine
in
the
heart
of
man
than
the
heart
of
man
can
contain
oh
heart
of
man
and
heart
of
woman
thirsting
for
blood
of
the
vine
life
waits
till
the
heart
has
lived
too
much
and
then
pours
in
new
wine
madeline
i
almost
heard
your
little
heart
begin
to
beat
and
since
that
hour
your
life
has
grown
apace
and
blossomed
fed
by
the
same
miraculous
power
that
moved
the
rivulet
of
your
life
and
made
your
heart
begin
to
beat
now
all
day
your
steps
are
oh
what
swift
and
musical
feet
you
sleep
i
wait
to
see
you
wake
with
and
hands
that
reach
i
laugh
to
hear
your
thoughts
that
gather
too
fast
on
your
budding
lips
for
speech
your
sunny
hair
is
cut
as
if
trimmed
around
a
yellow
crock
how
gay
the
ribbon
and
oh
how
cunning
the
flaring
skirt
of
the
little
frock
you
build
and
play
and
search
and
pry
and
hunt
for
dolls
and
forgotten
toys
why
do
you
never
tire
of
playing
or
cease
from
mischief
or
cease
from
noise
you
will
not
sleep
you
are
tired
of
the
house
you
are
just
as
naughty
as
you
can
be
madeline
madeline
come
to
the
garden
and
play
with
marcia
under
the
tree
marcia
madeline
hair
is
straight
and
yours
is
just
as
curly
as
tendril
vines
and
she
is
fair
but
a
deeper
color
your
cheeks
of
olive
incarnadines
a
serious
wisdom
burns
and
glows
steadily
in
your
look
already
a
wit
and
a
little
stoic
perhaps
you
are
going
to
write
a
book
or
paint
a
picture
or
sing
or
act
the
part
of
katherine
or
juliet
i
believe
you
were
born
with
the
gift
of
knowing
when
to
remember
and
when
to
forget
and
when
to
stifle
and
kill

your

in

the

that

under

the
altar
my
heart
is
an
altar
whereon
many
sacrificial
fires
have
been
kindled
in
praise
of
spring
and
aphrodite
my
heart
is
an
altar
of
chalcedony
crowned
with
a
tablet
of
bronze
blacked
with
smoke
scarred
with
fire
and
scented
with
the
aromatic
bitterness
of
dead
incense
albeit
let
us
murmur
a
little
doric
prayer
over
the
ashes
which
lie
scattered
around
the
altar
for
the
april
rain
has
wept
over
them
and
from
them
the
crocus
smelts
its
roman
gold
what
though
there
are
remnants
here
of
faded
coronals
and
bits
of
silver
string
torn
from
forgotten
harps
perfect
amid
the
ashes
sleeps
a
cup
of
amethyst
let
us
take
it
and
pour
the
sea
from
it
and
while
the
savor
of
dead
lips
is
washed
away
let
us
lift
our
hands
to
this
sky
of
hyacinth
let
us
light
the
altar
newly
for
lo
it
is
spring
bring
from
the
woodland
flames
of
columbine
and
there
where
the
woodman
burns
the
fallen
tree
and
scented
smoke
arises
on
azure
wings
between
the
branches
budding
with
adolescent
life
with
these
let
us
light
the
altar
that
a
scarlet
flame
may
lean
against
the
silver
sea
for
thou
art
fire
also
and
air
and
water
and
the
resurgent
earth
for
thou
art
woman
thou
art
love
thou
art
april
of
the
arcadian
moon
thou
art
the
swift
sun
racing
through
snowy
clouds
thou
art
the
creative
silence
of
flowering
valleys
thy
face
is
the
apple
tree
in
bloom
thine
eyes
the
glimpses
of
green
water
when
the
tree
blossoms
shake
as
soft
winds
fan
them
thy
hair
is
flame
blown
against
the

thou
art

the
fire
on
the
altar
burns
brightly
and
the
sea
sparkles
in
the
sun
let
us
murmur
a
doric
prayer

soul
desire
her
soul
is
like
a
wolf
that
stands
where
sunlight
falls
between
the
trees
of
a
sparse
forest
leafless
edge
when
spring
first
magic
moveth
these
her
soul
is
like
a
little
brook
thin
edged
with
ice
against
the
leaves
where
the
wolf
drinks
and
is
alone
and
where
the
woodbine
interweaves
a
bank
late
covered
by
the
snow
but
lighted
by
the
frozen
north
her
soul
is
like
a
little
plot
that
one
white
blossom
bringeth
forth
her
soul
is
slim
like
silver
slips
and
straight
like
flags
beside
a
stream
her
soul
is
like
a
shape
that
moves
and
changes
in
a
wonder
dream
who
would
pursue
her
clasps
a
cloud
and
taketh
sorrow
for
his
zeal
memory
shall
sing
him
many
songs
while
bound
upon
the
torture
wheel
her
soul
is
like
a
wolf
that
glides
by
moonlight
a
phantom
ridge
her
face
is
like
a
light
that
runs
beneath
the
shadow
of
a
bridge
her
voice
is
like
a
woodland
cry
heard
in
a
summer
desolate
hour
her
eyes
are
dim
her
lips
are
faint
and
tinctured
like
the
cuckoo
flower
her
little
breasts
are
like
the
buds
of
tulips
in
a
place
forlorn
her
soul
is
like
a
mandrake
bloom
standing
against
the
crimson
moon
her
dream
is
like
the
fenny
snake
that
warms
him
in
the
noonday
fire
she
hath
no
thought
nor
any
hope
save
of
herself
and
her
desire
she
is
not
life
she
is
not
death
she
is
not
fear
or
joy
or
grief
her
soul
is
like
a
quiet
sea
beneath
a
reef
she
is
the
shape
the
sailor
sees
that
slips
the
rock
without
a
sound
she
is
the
soul
that
comes
and
goes
and
leaves
no
mark
yet
makes
a
wound
she
is
the
soul
that
hunts
and
flies
she
is
a
mist
of
care
she
is
the
restlessness
of
life
its
rapture
and
despair

meek
and
turned
to
orient
pearls

tears
that
glistered
down
her
cheek
and
a
sound
of
music
passing
sweet
went

sir
launcelot
answered
never
a
word
but
rode
to
the
west
countree
until
through
the
forest
he
saw
a
light
that
shone
from
a
nunnery
sir
launcelot
entered
the
cloister
and
the
queen
fell
down
in
a
swoon

up
rose
sad
sir

and
rode
by
wold
and
mere
until
he
came
to
a
hermitage
where
bode
sir
bedivere
and
there
he
put
a
habit
on
and
there
did
pray
and
fast
and
when
sir
bedivere
told
him
all
his
heart
for
sorrow
brast
how
that
sir
mordred
traitorous
knight
betrayed
his
king
and
sire
and
how
king
arthur
wounded
died
broken
in
heart
desire
and
so
sir
launcelot
penance
made
and
worked
at
servile
toil
and
prayed
the
bishop
of
canterbury
his
sins
for
to
assoil
his
shield
went
clattering
on
the
wall
to
a
dolorous
wail
of
wind
his
casque
was
rust
his
mantle
dust
with
spider
webs
entwined
his
listless
horses
left
alone
went
cropping
where
they
would
to
see
the
noblest
knight
of
the
world
upon
his
sorrow
brood
anon
a
vision
came
in
his
sleep
and

looked
through
the
latticed
glass
on
the
queen
face
cold
and
pale
sir
launcelot
kissed
the
ceréd
cloth
and
none
could
stay
his
woe
her
hair
lay
back
from
the
oval
brow
and
her
nose
was
clear
as

and
frankincense
on

put
her
in

by

to
the
chant
of
a
doleful
tune
they
heaped
the
earth
on

and
launcelot
fell
in
a
swoon
sir
launcelot
went
to
the
hermitage

of

amen
in
michigan
you
wrote
come
over
to
saugatuck
and
be
with
me
on
the
warm
sand
and
under
cool
beeches
and
aromatic
cedars
and
just
then
no
one
could
do
a
thing
in
the
city
for
the
lure
of
far
places
and
something
that
tugged
at
one
heart
because
of
a
june
sky
and
stretches
of
blue
water
and
a
warm
wind
blowing
from
the
south
what
could
i
do
but
take
a
boat
and
go
to
meet
you
and
when
is
not
enough
but
you
must
live
also
and
when
the
present
stands
in
the
way
of
something
to
come
and
there
is
but
one
you
would
see
all
the
interval
of
waiting
is
a
wall
and
so
it
was
i
walked
the
landward
deck
with
flapping
coat
and
hat
pulled
down
and
i
sat
on
the
leeward
deck
and
looked
at
the
streaming
smoke
of
the
funnels
and
the
far
waste
of
rhythmical
water
and
at
the
gulls
flying
by
our
side
there
was
music
on
board
and
dancing
but
i
could
not
take
part
for
above
all
there
was
the
bluest
sky
and
around
us
the
urge
of
magical
distances
and
just
because
you
were
in
the
violins
and
in
everything
and
were
wholly
the
world
of
sense
and
sight
it
was
too
much
one
could
not
live
it
and
make
it
all
his
own
it
was
too
much
and
i
wondered
where
the
rest
could
be
going
or
what
they
thought
of
water
and
sky
without
knowing
you
but
at
four
there
was
a
rim
a
circled
edge
of
rainbow
color
which
suspired
widened
and
narrowed
under
your
gaze
it
was
the
phantasy
of
straining
eyes
or
land
and
it
was
land
it
was
distant
trees
and
then
it
was
dunes
bluffs
of
yellow
sand
we
began
to
wonder
how
far
it
was
five
miles
or
ten
miles
surely
only
five
miles
but
at
last
whatever
it
was
we
swung
to
the
end
we
rounded
the
lighthouse
pier
almost
before
we
knew
we
slowed
our
speed
in
a
dizzy
river
of
black
we
drifted
softly
to
dock
i
took
the
ferry
i
crossed
the
river
i
ran
almost
through
the
little
batch
of
fishermen
shacks
i
climbed
the
winding
road
of
the
hill
and
dove
in
a
shadowy
quiet
of
paths
of
moss
and
dancing
leaves
and
straight
stretched
limbs
of
giant
pines
on
patches
of
sky
i
ran
to
the
top
of
the
bluff
where
the
stood
and
there
the
sunlit
lake
burst
on
me
and
air
and
below
me
was
the
beach
where
the
serried
lines
of
hurrying
water
came
up
like
rank
on
rank
of
men
and
fell
with
a
shout
on
the
rocks
i
plunged
i
stumbled
i
ran
down
the
hill
for
i
thought
i
saw
you
and
it
was
you
you
were
there
and
i
shall
never
forget
your
cry
nor
how
you
raised
your
arms
and
cried
and
laughed
when
you
saw
me
and
there
we
were
with
the
lake
and
the
sun
with
his
ruddy
blaze
stretching
back
to
lost
chicago
the
sun
the
lake
the
beach
and
ourselves
were
all
that
was
left
of
time
all
else
was
lost
you
were
making
a
camp
you
had
bent
from
the
bank
a
cedar
bough
and
tied
it
down
and
over
it
flung
a
quilt
of
many
colors
and
under
it
spread
on
the
voluptuous
silt
gray
blankets
and
canvas
pillows
i
saw
it
all
in
a
glance
and
there
in
dread
of
eyes
we
stood
scanning
the
bluff
and
the
beach
lest
in
the
briefest
touch
of
lips
we
might
be
seen
for
there
were
eyes
or
we
thought
there
were
eyes
on
the
porch
of
the
lodge
and
eyes
along
the
forest
rim
on
the
hill
and
eyes
on
the
shore
but
a
minute
past
there
was
no
sun
only
a
star
that
shone
like
a
match
which
lights
to
a
blue
intenseness
amid
the
glow
of
a
hearth
and
we
sat
on
the
sand
as
dusk
came
down
in
a
communion
of
silence
and
low
words
till
you
said
at
last
we
sup
at
the
lodge
then
say
good
night
to
me
and
leave
as
if
to
stay
overnight
in
the
village
but
instead
make
a
long
detour
through
the
wood
and
come
to
the
shore
through
that
ravine
be
here
at
the
tent
at
midnight
and
so
i
did
i
stole
through
echoless
ways
where
no
twigs
broke
and
where
i
heard
my
heart
beat
like
a
watch
under
a
pillow
and
the
whippoorwills
were
singing
and
the
sound
of
the
surf
below
me
was
the
sound
of
leaves
in
a
wind
that
makes
no
pause
i
hurried
down
the
steep
ravine
and
a
bat
flew
up
at
my
feet
from
the
brush
and
crossed
the
moon
to
my
left
was
the
lighthouse
and
black
and
deep
purples
far
away
and
all
was
still
till
i
stood
breathless
by
the
tent
and
heard
your
whispered
welcome
and
felt
your
kiss
lovers
lay
at
on
roofs
of
memphis
and
athens
and
looked
at
tropical
stars
as
large
as
golden
beetles
nothing
is
new
save
this
and
this
is
always
new
and
there
in
your
tent
with
the
balm
of
the
breeze
sweeping
over
us
we
looked
at
one
great
star
through
a
flap
of
your
tent
and
the
eternal
quality
of
rapture
and
mystery
and
vision
flowed
through
us
next
day
we
went
to
grand
haven
for
my
desire
was
your
desire
whatever
wish
one
had
the
other
had
and
up
the
grand
river
we
rowed
with
rushes
and
lily
pads
about
us
and
the
sand
hills
back
of
us
till
we
came
to
a
quiet
land
a
lotus
place
of
farms
and
meadows
and
we
tied
our
boat
to
schmitty
dock
where
we
had
a
dinner
of
fish
and
where
after
resting
to
follow
your
will
we
drifted
back
to
spring
lake
and
under
a
larger
moon
now
almost
full
walked
three
miles
to
the
beeches
by
a
winding
country
road
where
we
had
supper
and
afterwards
a
long
sleep
waking
to
the
song
of
robins
and
that
day
i
said
there
are
wild
places
blue
water
pine
forests
there
are
apple
orchards
and
wonderful
roads
around
elk
lake
shall
we
go
and
we
went
for
your
desire
was
mine
and
there
we
climbed
hills
and
ate
apples
along
the
shaded
ways
and
rolled
great
boulders
down
the
steeps
to
watch
them
splash
in
the
water
and
we
stood
and
wondered
what
was
beyond
the
farther
shore
two
miles
away
and
we
came
to
a
place
on
the
shore
where
four
great
pine
trees
stood
and
underneath
them
wild
flowers
to
the
edge
of
sand
so
soft
for
naked
feet
and
here
for
not
a
soul
was
near
we
stripped
and
swam
far
out
laughing
rejoicing
rolling
and
diving
in
those
great
depths
of
bracing
water
under
a
glittering
sun
there
were
farm
houses
enough
for
food
and
shelter
but
something
urged
us
on
one
knows
the
end
and
dreads
the
end
yet
seeks
the
end
and
you
asked
is
there
a
town
near
let
see
a
town
so
we
walked
to
traverse
city
through
land
and
blasted
trunks
and
stumps
of
pine
and
by
the
side
of
desolate
hills
but
when
we
got
to
traverse
city
you
were
not
content
nor
was
i
something
urged
us
on
then
you
thought
of
northport
and
of
its
norse
and
german
fishermen
and
its
quaint
piers
where
they
smoke
fish
so
we
drove
for
thirty
miles
in
a
speeding
automobile
over
hills
around
sudden
curves
into
warm
coverts
or
hollows
sometimes
at
the
edge
of
the
bay
again
on
the
hill
from
where
we
could
see
old
mission
amid
blues
and
blacks
across
a
score
of
miles
of
the
bay
waving
like
watered
silk
under
the
moon
and
by
meadows
of
clover
newly
cut
and
by
peach
orchards
and
vineyards
but
when
we
came
to
the
little
town
already
asleep
though
it
was
but
eight
and
only
a
few
drowsy
lamps
with
misty
eyelids
shone
from
a
store
or
two
i
said
do
you
see
those
twinkling
lights
that
northport
point
that
the
cedar
cabin
let
go
to
the
cedar
cabin
and
so
we
crossed
the
bay
amid
great
waves
in
a
plunging
launch
and
a
roaring
breeze
and
a
great
moon
for
now
the
moon
was
full
so
here
was
the
cedar
cabin
on
a
strip
of
land
as
wide
as
a
house
and
lawn
and
on
one
side
lake
michigan
and
on
one
side
the
bay
there
were
distances
of
color
all
around
and
stars
and
darknesses
of
land
and
trees
and
at
the
point
the
lighthouse
and
over
us
the
moon
and
over
the
balcony
of
our
room
all
of
these
where
we
lay
till
i
slept
listening
to
the
water
of
the
lake
and
the
water
of
the
bay
and
we
saw
the
moon
sink
like
a
red
bomb
and
we
saw
the
stars
change
as
the
sky
wheeled
now
this
was
the
end
of
the
earth
for
this
strip
of
land
ran
out
to
a
point
no
larger
than
one
of
the
stumps
we
saw
on
the
desolate
hills
and
moreover
it
seemed
to
dive
under
or
waste
away
in
a
sudden
depth
of
water
and
around
it
was
a
swirl
to
the
north
the
bounding
waves
of
the
lake
and
to
the
south
the
bay
which
seemed
the
lake
but
could
we
speak
of
it
even
though
i
saw
your
eyes
when
you
thought
of
it
a
sigh
of
wind
blew
through
the
rustic
temple
when
we
saw
this
symbol
together
and
neither
spoke
but
that
night
somewhere
in
the
beginning
of
drowsiness
you
said
there
is
no
further
place
to
go
we
must
retrace
and
i
awoke
in
a
torrent
of
light
in
the
room
hearing
voices
and
steps
on
the
walk
i
looked
for
you
but
you
had
arisen
then
i
dressed
and
searched
for
you
but
you
were
gone
then
i
stood
for
long
minutes
looking
at
a
sail
far
out
at
sea
and
departed
too
the
star
i
am
a
certain
god
who
slipped
down
from
a
remote
height
to
a
place
of
pools
and
stars
and
i
sat
invisible
amid
a
clump
of
trees
to
watch
the
madmen
there
were
cries
and
groans
about
me
and
shouts
of
laughter
and
curses
figures
passed
by
with
contempt
wrinkling
in
bitter
smiles
about
their
lips
others
hurried
on
with
set
eyes
pursuing
something
then
i
said
this
is
the
place
for
mad
frederick
mad
frederick
will
be
here
but
everywhere
i
could
see
figures
sitting
or
standing
by
little
pools
some
seemed
grown
into
the
soil
and
were
helpless
and
of
these
some
were
asleep
others
laughed
the
laughter
that
comes
from
dying
men
trying
to
face
death
and
others
said
i
should
be
content
and
others
said
i
will
fly
whereupon
sepulchral
voices
muttered
as
of
creatures
sitting
or
hanging
head
down
from
limbs
of
the
trees
we
will
not
let
you
and
others
looked
in
their
pools
and
clasped
hands
and
said
gone
all
gone
by
other
pools
there
were
dead
bodies
some
of
youth
some
of
age
they
had
given
up
the
fight
they
had
drunk
poisoned
water
they
had
searched
until
they
fell
all
had
gone
mad
then
i
a
certain
god
curious
to
know
what
it
is
in
pools
and
stars
that
drives
men
and
women
over
the
earth
in
this
quest
waited
for
mad
frederick
and
then
i
heard
his
step
i
knew
that
long
ago
he
sat
by
one
of
these
pools
enraptured
of
a
star
image
and
that
hands
for
his
own
good
as
they
said
dumped
clay
into
the
pool
and
blotted
his
star
and
i
knew
that
after
that
he
had
said
they
will
never
spy
again
upon
my
ecstasy
they
will
never
see
me
watching
one
star
i
will
fly
by
rivers
and
by
little
brooks
and
by
the
edge
of
lakes
and
by
little
bends
of
water
where
no
wind
blows
and
glance
at
stars
as
i
pass
they
will
never
spy
again
upon
my
ecstasy
and
i
knew
that
mad
frederick
in
this
flight
through
years
of
restless
and
madness
was
caught
by
the
image
of
a
star
in
a
mere
beyond
a
meadow
down
from
a
hill
under
a
forest
and
had
said
no
one
sees
here
i
can
find
life
through
vision
of
eternal
things
but
they
had
followed
him
they
stood
on
the
brow
of
the
hill
and
when
they
saw
him
gazing
in
the
water
they
rolled
a
great
stone
down
the
hill
and
shattered
the
star
image
then
mad
frederick
fled
with
laughter
it
echoed
through
the
wood
and
he
said
i
will
look
for
moons
i
will
punish
them
who
disturb
me
by
worshiping
moons
but
when
he
sought
moons
they
left
him
alone
and
he
did
not
want
the
moons
and
he
was
alone
and
sick
from
the
moons
and
covered
as
with
a
white
blankness
which
was
the
worst
madness
of
all
and
i
a
certain
god
waiting
for
mad
frederick
to
enter
this
place
of
pools
and
stars
saw
him
at
last
with
a
sigh
he
looked
about
upon
his
fellows
sitting
or
standing
by
their
pools
and
some
of
the
pools
were
covered
with
scum
and
some
were
glazed
as
of
filth
and
some
were
grown
with
weeds
and
some
were
congealed
as
of
the
north
wind
and
a
few
were
yet
pure
and
held
the
star
image
and
by
these
some
sat
and
were
glad
others
had
lost
the
vision
the
star
was
there
but
its
meaning
vanished
and
mad
frederick
going
here
and
there
with
no
purpose
only
curious
and
interested
as
i
was
a
certain
god
came
by
a
certain
pool
and
saw
a
star
he
shivered
he
clasped
his
hands
he
sank
to
his
knees
he
touched
his
lips
to
the
water
then
voices
from
the
limbs
of
the
trees
muttered
there
he
is
again
he
must
be
driven
away
the
pool
is
not
his
he
does
not
belong
here
so
as
when
bats
fly
in
a
cave
they
swooped
from
their
hidings
in
the
trees
and
dashed
themselves
in
the
pool
then
i
saw
what
these
flying
things
were
but
no
matter
they
were
illusions
evil
and
envious
and
dull
but
with
power
to
destroy
and
mad
frederick
turned
away
from
the
pool
and
covered
his
eyes
with
his
arms
then
a
certain
god
of
less
power
than
mine
came
and
sat
beside
me
and
said
why
do
you
allow
this
to
be
they
are
all
seeking
why
do
you
not
let
them
find
their
heart
delight
why
do
you
allow
this
to
be
but
i
did
not
answer
the
lesser
god
did
not
know
that
i
have
no
power
that
only
the
god
has
the
power
and
that
this
must
be
in
spite
of
all
lesser
gods
and
i
saw
mad
frederick
arise
and
ascend
to
the
top
of
a
high
hill
and
i
saw
him
find
the
star
whose
image
he
had
seen
in
the
pool
then
he
knelt
and
prayed
give
me
to
understand
o
star
your
inner
self
your
eternal
spirit
that
i
may
have
you
and
not
images
of
you
so
that
i
may
know
what
has
driven
me
through
the
world
and
may
cure
