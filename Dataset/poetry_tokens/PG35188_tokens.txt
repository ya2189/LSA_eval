cool
night
of
the

moon
of
harvest
when
the
tribal
storehouses
were
full
heaped
with
dried
fish
and
bear
buffalo
and
deer
meat
with
little
mountains
of
maize
for
winter
when
the
cakes
and
candles
of
yellow
tallow
were
moulded
past
numbering
when
the
seed
baskets
were
high
heaped
with
richness
and
many
deep
nut
baskets
were
overflowing
when
the
dried
berries
from
far
thickets
made
little

painted
hills
then
all
of
the
tribe
of
our
hunting
grounds
bathed
their
hard
worked
bodies
oiled
their
smooth
skins
painted
their
happy
faces
and
put
on
the
wealth
of
their
richest
robes
for
the
great
dance
of
thanksgiving
when
the
robins
made
love
chase
that
season
in
the
secret
ceremonial
of
the
wise
old
women
my
maiden
hour
had
been
celebrated
always
had
my
proud
savage
mother
taken
me
alone
to
the
forest
and
there
beating
hands
and
chanting
she
had
carefully
taught
me
the
wonder
dance
of
the
maidens
hour
of
the
mandanas
her
people
it
was
a
dance
of
moonlight
and
moon
madness
of
sign
love
talk
of
eyes
asking
great
gifts
of
swift
feet
stamping
like
the
roebuck
and
singing
bead
and
shell
trinket
music
so
that
all
the
night
was
softly
lighted
with
strange
visions
flower
sweet
on
the
day
of
the
thanksgiving
ceremonial
when
my
mother
oiled
me
to
leaf
fine
smoothness
and
hung
me
heavy
with
bracelets
of
bone
beads
and
a
necklace
of
precious
carved
blue
shell
as
her
skilled
hands
of
love
flew
in
my
ear
she
made
canawac
talk
before
the
great
sachem
on
his
high
throne
of
prideful
authority
with
the
son
who
follows
him
in
council
sitting
beside
his
knee
when
thou
leadest
the
thanksgiving
dance
at
the
head
of
the
young
women
thou
shalt
wave
all
of
them
back
to
their
places
and
alone
before
the
assembled
chieftains
thou
shalt
dance
the
mating
dance
of
the
rich
and
powerful
mandanas
ever
keeping
thine
eye
of
glad
submission
fast
on
the
eye
of
mountain
lion
if
the
soft
light
in
his
eye
strike
fire
for
thee
then
shalt
thou
forget
all
others
and
dance
out
thy
heart
for
him
alone
and
bow
low
as
the
young
cedar
before
him
and
as
the
serpent
charm
him
if
he
arise
and
stand
facing
thee
and
dance
love
manifest
before
thee
then
is
the
hour
come
for
thy
union
with
him
then
shall
i
fly
to
set
up
thy
wigwam
of
doeskin
bleached
with
love
that
many
suns
i
have
worked
on
in
hiding
for
thee
and
gladly
in
the
sand
before
it
thou
shalt
set
thy
lighted
candle
thy
tall
proud
candle
of
gold
bear
tallow
and
if
he
come
to
thee
with
soft
words
with
words
of
wooing
magic
then
shalt
thou
bury
thy
candle
flame
in
the
yielding
sands
before
him
then
art
thou
our
chieftainess
in
seasons
to
come
and
high
shall
thy
sure
heart
beat
with
pride
of
love
and
power
and
swift
shall
thy
red
blood
run
in
leaping
streams
with
the
tide
of
mighty
chieftains
braves
shall
thy
many
straight
sons
be
great
chiefs
who
shall
rule
other
far
nations
and
sweet
shall
thy
tall
strong
women
be
as
the
red
that
grows
in
the
forest
and
swift
shall
their
hearts
be
as
the
heart
of
the
frightened
fawn
that
leaps
with
feathered
feet
before
the
hunter
medicine
man
make
me
a
sure
medicine
a
strong
medicine
new
to
our
people
that
shall
ease
my
weary
eyes
of
a
red
bird
and
a
white
lily
when
the
harvest
ceremonial
dance
was
cried
through
all
the
village
when
night
crept
silent
as
the
bat
wing
from
the
blanketed
heart
of
the
forest
when
the
great
assembly
lodge
was
lighted
and
filled
with
happy
faces
when
the
old
chiefs
and
the
wise
men
had
spoken
thanksgivings
for
fat
harvest
and
the
time
was
come
for
all
the
tribe
to
rejoice
first
came
the
dance
of
the
little
stumbling
children
the
little
fat
bellied
round
faced
serious
children
with
shining
black
hair
and
wonder
eyes
and
flower
red
cheeks
and
mouths
and
stout
breath
like
short
gusts
of
north
wind
when
worn
out
with
swift
dances
they
rolled
in
their
soft
blankets
came
the
shy
youths
dance
and
the
uncertain
growing
all
bravely
tinkling
little
necklaces
of
squirrel
and
rabbit
teeth
and
bright
rare
shells
then
danced
the
carefully
trained
young
women
grown
and
ripe
for
the
harvest
of
love
in
their
lead
i
did
as
my
mother
had
told
me
straight
i
stood
before
the
great
sachem
and
the
son
of
the
pride
of
his
heart
high
i
lifted
my
head
like
a
proud
pine
tree
and
softly
i
shook
my
bracelets
of
beads
and
rattled
my
necklace
of
blue
shell
and
rustled
the
porcupine
fringes
of
my
fine
robe
of
yellow
in
music
like
the
little
secret
whispering
among
the
dry
grass
under
passing
feet
i
spoke
as
i
had
always
been
taught
by
my
mother
great
chief
grant
that
i
dance
before
thee
the
woman
love
dance
of
the
brave
mandanas
a
dance
that
i
have
learned
from
the
swift
feet
of
my
mother
searchingly
the
great
sachem
looked
at
his
son
and
his
son
looked
at
me
with
understanding
and
made
a
swift
sign
to
his
father
so
raising
his
hands
of
authority
the
great
sachem
cried
aloud
yiada
daughter
of
chief
white
wolf
will
dance
the
woman
dance
of
the
mandanas
let
all
others
be
seated
i
have
said
it
alone
with
the
blood
of
heart
red
on
lip
and
cheek
and
with
the
pride
of
my
asking
heart
beating
like
wings
on
my
light
feet
with
my
mother
keeping
time
for
me
as
she
did
in
the
secret
forest
slowly
i
stepped
into
the
great
dance
of
the
mandanas
of
the
peace
lands
the
strongest
love
medicine
ever
measured
by
the
feet
of
wild
women
as
i
danced
even
as
my
mother
had
long
told
me
i
kept
my
eyes
ever
spying
deep
into
the
eyes
of
mountain
lion
when
the
dance
grew
to
its
swiftest
wildest
note
when
my
proud
head
of
certainty
and
my
willing
arms
were
high
lifted
and
the
beads
and
obsidian
and
blue
shell
tinkled
soft
singing
like
falling
rain
mountain
lion
sprang
to
his
feet
and
came
down
in
the
firelight
before
me
with
no
knowledge
of
the
dance
of
the
mandanas
and
no
teaching
of
step
or
of
posture
he
fell
into
the
strange
measures
that
my
mother
had
taught
me
with
eyes
upon
eyes
and
heart
near
to
heart
facing
in
the
wide
fire
flaming
circle
where
envious
faces
kept
watch
upon
us
we
danced
the
wonder
dance
of
the
hour
of
full
womanhood
medicine
man
o
medicine
man
healer
of
the
hearts
of
the
mandanas
there
facing
the
chiefs
and
maidens
of
a
thousand
lodges
of
our
tribe
with
the
great
sachem
keenly
watching
on
his
high
throne
of
great
power
darest
say
that
was
not
my
hour
my
rightful
moon
of
exultation
when
i
looked
near
the
close
of
the
dance
toward
my
mother
for
guidance
she
gave
me
the
swift
happy
sign
of
birds
flying
so
i
caught
that
joyful
sign
and
i
gave
it
to
the
waiting
maidens
like
homing
swallows
they
swept
around
me
the
young
braves
came
stamping
like
roebucks
before
the
does
of
spring
then
all
of
us
changed
the
dance
to
the
love
measures
of
the
canawacs
when
the
chattering
maidens
went
back
to
their
waiting
mothers
i
stood
there
tall
and
straight
and
proud
fresh
as
the
wing
of
the
eagle
from
the
highest
peak
of
dawn
eye
to
eye
face
to
face
with
mountain
lion
his
eyes
burned
deep
into
my
eyes
with
a
look
of
quivering
power
medicine
man
darest
thou
say
that
was
not
the
great
understanding
so
when
all
of
the
others
went
on
with
the
dance
of
thanksgiving
soft
as
the
veiling
mists
from
the
dim
breast
of
evening
meadows
i
slipped
from
the
council
house
and
i
flew
to
our
lodge
with
hands
of
high
satisfaction
my
mother
set
my
wigwam
beside
her
lodge
i
lighted
my
tall
happy
candle
of
bear
fat
i
opened
my
doorway
wide
to
the
friendly
moon
deep
in
the
sands
i
set
my
love
light
to
burning
and
there
i
waited
long
and
long
i
waited
in
burning
eagerness
of
heart
tremblingly
listening
with
each
breath
for
the
sure
step
of
mountain
lion
then
medicine
man
with
black
angered
sign
talk
and
fierce
eyes
of
leaping
fire
came
my
storm
driven
mother
as
she
came
toward
me
like
a
killing
wind
uprooting
the
cedars
arose
high
clamour
from
the
council
lodge
she
caught
up
my
hopeful
waiting
candle
my
living
love
token
to
mountain
lion
my
man
she
buried
its
flame
deep
in
the
white
sands
in
rage
she
thrust
it
from
her
she
snatched
shut
the
welcoming
doors
before
the
eyes
of
anguish
of
my
mother
of
my
willing
doeskin
wigwam
and
in
the
harsh
low
voiced
canawac
tongue
she
cried
to
me
in
choking
anger
woe
is
upon
us
strangers
have
reached
us
comes
a
great
chief
from
tribes
of
the
far
north
from
the
camps
of
the
powerful
killimacs
from
the
home
fires
of
the
ice
god
and
with
him
on
a
snow
white
pony
rides
his
beautiful
raven
haired
daughter
a
tall
proud
princess
of
a
great
warlike
nation
this
night
mountain
lion
will
not
come
to
thee
his
father
has
sent
him
to
serve
the
rich
strangers
get
thee
back
to
thy
place
in
the
council
lodge
before
the
venom
tipped
finger
pointers
miss
thee
for
there
will
be
great
feasting
and
much
talk
the
rejoicing
will
last
for
many
suns
and
moons
it
was
the
wrong
time
for
thy
dance
of
allurement
thy
maiden
proffer
of
prideful
loving
but
i
thy
mother
taught
thee
thy
undoing
i
thy
mother
gave
to
thee
the
sign
then
medicine
man
as
fierce
a
storm
as
ever
tore
the
forest
as
ever
pitched
the
sea
high
in
wild
fury
broke
in
my
heart
leaping
to
flee
its
lodging
place
i
lifted
my
head
high
and
proudly
and
silently
i
stepped
into
the
moon
tide
but
i
trembled
and
shook
with
sickness
my
blood
ran
hot
angry
gushes
and
i
who
had
never
known
pain
in
any
part
of
my
strong
body
now
felt
its
rending
arrows
tearing
my
heart
in
sick
torture
as
i
crept
through
the
restless
whispering
forest
where
the
wise
old
yellow
leaves
talked
over
my
shame
with
each
other
and
every
mocking
finger
of
night
pointed
in
derision
at
my
wounded
side
i
crept
back
to
the
council
lodge
still
as
a
panther
fending
for
her
cubs
i
slipped
in
unseen
by
any
and
took
up
my
place
among
the
young
women
on
the
high
throne
of
power
beside
our
great
sachem
storm
wind
sat
a
tall
chief
trailing
rich
robes
of
white
fox
sealskin
and
white
bear
a
proud
chief
of
savage
face
weighted
with
a
heavy
necklace
of
eagles
claws
many
elk
teeth
and
lion
talons
hanging
across
his
broad
shoulders
standing
still
and
straight
before
them
first
i
saw
the
stranger
woman
i
heard
the
deep
voice
of
her
father
toned
to
soft
talk
as
among
peace
councils
when
he
told
the
great
sachem
and
chieftains
and
all
the
watching
canawacs
this
is
my
daughter
a
princess
of
seven
tribes
she
who
can
run
with
the
foot
of
the
hare
who
can
dance
as
the
gold
birch
leaves
when
spring
comes
stealing
from
the
southland
who
can
guide
the
swift
canoes
surely
and
ride
the
wild
ponies
on
the
chase
whose
fingers
are
skilful
in
basket
weaving
in
beading
and
braiding
and
polishing
ornaments
she
comes
with
me
to
make
the
friendship
of
a
people
of
her
mother
blood
and
her
name
is
a
name
held
sacred
among
all
the
tribes
at
peace
with
us
like
music
there
fell
from
his
smooth
tongue
a
name
well
known
to
council
wise
canawacs
a
breath
of
sweetness
he
spoke
it
like
the
easy
tongue
of
a
lazy
brook
softly
singing
among
the
small
stones
of
its
bed
then
every
canawac
remembered
the
dark
days
when
the
great
spirit
became
justly
angered
and
in
the
height
of
his
deep
wrath
against
the
treachery
of
all
tribes
drew
up
the
waters
of
destruction
until
they
covered
the
earth
face
leaving
upon
the
tallest
tree
only
one
chief
and
his
mate
and
one
pair
of
every
bird
and
climbing
beast
on
the
top
of
the
highest
mountain
of
all
the
earth
known
to
man
when
the
water
had
come
up
to
the
top
branches
until
only
their
heads
were
above
it
and
had
stood
still
for
three
weary
suns
then
slowly
it
drew
back
and
left
the
earth
barren
so
there
was
no
fire
to
cook
food
for
the
hungry
sachem
and
his
mate
nor
to
warm
the
water
soaked
camping
grounds
then
the
sachem
sent
a
beaver
messenger
far
down
to
the
underworld
to
borrow
only
one
coal
from
the
campfires
of
the
dark
spirits
but
the
beaver
was
not
able
to
bring
it
for
burning
his
mouth
cruelly
then
he
sent
the
fierce
mountain
lion
searching
all
over
the
earth
for
campfires
but
there
was
no
fire
to
be
found
for
the
water
had
been
everywhere
then
he
sent
a
little
gray
bird
to
the
spirit
world
to
bring
from
the
campfires
of
the
unseen
country
one
living
coal
with
which
to
make
a
fire
for
the
cooking
kettles
and
and
to
warm
the
lodges
of
all
the
tribes
that
would
follow
him
in
suns
to
come
so
the
dauntless
little
gray
bird
slowly
winged
across
the
far
spaces
three
suns
arose
and
set
and
at
the
red
evening
when
the
third
sun
plunged
its
face
in
the
sea
with
all
of
its
plumage
burned
a
red
with
a
beak
of
red
like
hot
coals
and
its
face
blackened
with
fire
came
the
brave
panting
bird
with
a
living
coal
held
fast
in
its
mouth
a
coal
snatched
from
the
high
altars
of
the
far
country
of
the
spirits
and
so
the
fire
gift
was
brought
back
to
earth
to
warm
the
hearts
and
the
wigwams
of
every
nation
for
all
seasons
to
come
the
bird
was
sent
from
a
stranger
tribe
far
to
the
south
of
our
hunting
grounds
where
the
hot
suns
shine
and
the
grass
withers
but
travellers
journeying
northward
to
see
us
had
told
our
grandfathers
about
it
had
shown
us
the
bird
of
bloody
red
beak
and
face
still
blackened
with
fire
singing
gaily
in
our
summer
forests
singing
even
in
the
ice
of
winter
often
when
we
chanted
songs
of
thanksgiving
to
the
great
spirit
for
rich
gifts
when
we
thanked
him
for
the
buffalo
and
beaver
for
the
deer
meat
and
fish
and
corn
for
winter
then
our
tribes
made
a
ceremonial
of
glad
rejoicing
for
the
bird
that
brought
back
the
great
wonder
gift
of
fire
its
sacred
name
fell
on
our
ears
like
the
peace
of
the
great
spirit
fell
soft
as
flying
snowflakes
when
first
squaw
winter
comes
soft
as
the
hunting
wing
of
the
thieving
owl
sweet
as
the
breath
of
flowers
in
the
nesting
moon
from
the
lips
of
the
great
chief
before
him
her
shining
head
bowed
our
people
watched
her
in
silent
wonder
she
was
tall
taller
than
any
of
our
women
tall
and
slender
like
the
singing
wind
reeds
that
grow
around
the
magic
pool
of
the
white
spirit
lily
of
the
still
water
far
back
in
the
valley
pastures
she
moved
like
the
night
hawk
slowly
sweeping
across
the
moon
sky
from
the
proud
lift
of
her
head
and
the
eagle
look
of
her
dark
eye
from
the
red
flower
flame
of
her
soft
lips
and
the
sureness
of
her
being
i
could
see
that
the
heart
of
her
was
like
a
wiry
little
war
pony
swiftly
racing
up
the
steep
trail
of
her
breast
with
the
hunt
blood
of
the
soft
chase
fevering
its
questing
nostrils
no
woman
among
our
people
had
seen
the
beauty
of
her
robe
for
she
stood
in
flower
white
flower
fine
doeskin
bleached
and
tanned
like
winter
snowdrift
like
the
shining
water
flower
face
of
far
lakes
like
the
wide
wing
of
a
homing
white
swan
like
the
silver
rays
of
the
big
cold
hunting
moon
all
around
her
feet
fell
soft
knotted
fringes
cut
deep
as
the
height
of
the
first
upstanding
of
papooses
ready
to
walk
and
her
belt
and
her
neck
were
deeply
embroidered
with
a
thousand
green
stained
quills
from
the
backs
of
many
porcupines
while
her
long
heavy
necklace
was
got
from
traders
crossing
far
seas
for
it
lay
soft
dull
jade
like
the
green
wave

in
the
deepest
bay

tinted

when
one
looked
upon
her
searchingly
as
i
looked
long
upon
her
that
night
of
fat
harvest
thanksgiving
slowly
one
saw
creeping
from
her
bare
arms
from
her
firm
high
breasts
over
the
dark
gleaming
bowed
head
and
sure
slender
shoulders
of
her
a
faint
waving
cloud
like
fine
blue
mist
that
could
have
been
none
other
than
the
secret
power
of
the
great
spirit
stealing
from
her
breast
to
wrap
around
her
so
that
any
evil
spirit
magic
might
not
be
strong
to
work
against
her

could
see
that
she
was
softer
than
our
hard
working
women

she
had
learned
from
the
bee
to
be
busy
and
useful

marvelled
at
the
quiet

heart
of
my
father
the
white
wolf
grew
tender
as
he
studied

held
the
bird
toward
him

should

as
do

wounded
from

polished
mussel
shell

had
brought

looked
not
at
the
broken
bird
as
we
did
but
far
into
the
eyes
of
the
princess
of
the
killimacs
medicine
man
was
it
not
a
brave
hour
was
it
not
a
warrior
hour
that
hour
in
which
i
stood
unflinching
and
saw
her
take
him
from
me
i
whose
heart
had
possessed
him
since
we
shot
the
play
arrows
of
childhood
and
together
chased
the
painted
wings
through
the
flower
fields
of
the
canawacs
then
came
prairie
flower
mate
of
the
great
sachem
to
lead
away
the
mighty
strangers
for
many
suns
and
as
many
moons
we
feasted
and
danced
gaily
was
i
not
brave
to
wear
fine
robes
nightly
to
chant
boastful
songs
my
breast
was
torn
and
bleeding
as
the
broken
wing
of
the
fire
bird
yet
many
searing
times
at
the
command
of
the
great
sachem
was
i
made
to
smile
in
the
council
lodge
and
to
dance
the
love
dance
of
the
mandanas
that
dance
that
i
had
learned
in
secret
from
the
flying
feet
of
my
mother
learned
only
for
mountain
lion
for
the
great
ceremonial
of
love
giving
medicine
man
hear
me
not
again
did
the
eyes
of
mountain
lion
travel
across
the
council
lodge
to
seek
my
eyes
in
understanding
had
taken
his
eyes
on
her
face
she
proudly
kept
them
for
he
saw
nought
but
the
blue
mist
around
her
the
gleam
of
her
hair
the
red
bow
of
her
lips
he
heard
nought
but
the
luring
music
of
her
echo
sweet
voice
and
the
happy
song
of
her
quilled
robe
as
she
hourly
passed
among
our
people
while
always
clinging
to
her
breast
or
shoulder
proud
and
fearless
as
in
freedom
rode
the
sacred
wounded
bird
of
blood
redness
her
father
homed
in
wigwams
near
the
lodge
of
the
great
sachem
rode
his
hunting
pony
on
the
far
chase
beside
him
sat
on
high
in
the
councils
of
our
chieftains
when
the
dancing
and
feasting
were
over
it
was
known
through
the
voices
of
the
criers
that
for
many
moons
our
visitors
would
home
beside
our
campfires
learning
of
our
wisdom
from
us
teaching
where
their
customs
differed
the
great
sachem
was
swift
to
order
the
rarest
fish
from
sea
or
river
the
juiciest
of
the
small
birds
from
the
snares
of
the
children
the
tenderest
fawn
flesh
from
the
arrows
of
the
hunters
to
be
brought
for
the
cooking
kettles
of
the
strangers
who
trusted
us
every
day
i
watched
the
slow
sun
and
at
night
i
danced
with
the
maidens
but
no
sleep
came
to
my
eyes
no
hunger
came
to
my
body
my
mother
tempted
me
with
bits
as
sweet
as
the
sachem
had
commanded
for
but
my
parched
throat
refused
them
in
scorn
my
dry
tongue
found
no
savour
in
juicy
fatness
my
hot
hands
could
not
place
the
beads
evenly
then
it
was
that
my
mother
came
to
my
wigwam
and
closing
the
doorway
she
stood
before
me
and
long
and
long
she
looked
far
into
my
heart
deep
in
her
eyes
there
gathered
the
black
fury
and
a
storm
like
the
wildest
storm
that
ever
twisted
the
cedars
in
wrath
raged
in
her
rocking
breasts
and
her
lightning
flashing
eyes
fiercely
in
the
silent
canawac
motion
tongue
her
look
burning
into
my
living
spirit
she
made
the
sign
of
the
quick
kill
and
turning
she
slipped
like
a
vision
from
my
wigwam
of
torture
as
she
crept
into
the
mouth
of
darkness
o
medicine
man
i
knew
that
she
had
but
made
the
outward
sign
for
the
savage
inward
purpose
long
hardening
in
my
deepest
heart
the
next
sun
when
our
mothers
sent
the
maidens
with
their
baskets
to
the
fall
nut
gathering
i
kept
ever
close
beside
my
enemy
and
in
my
breast
there
flamed
fierce
anger
that
she
had
robbed
my
heart
always
at
the
door
of
her
wigwam
rocking
in
the
sunshine
of
each
dawning
hung
a
yellow
osier
basket
woven
like
a
ball
with
its
ribs
placed
wide
enough
apart
to
give
the
gifts
of
light
and
air
close
enough
to
prison
a
flame
red
bird
and
there
healed
of
his
wounds
but
forever
broken
for
flight
on
a
twig
shaped
and
placed
by
mountain
lion
the
flame
feathered
voyager
of
air
sang
a
song
filled
with
tears
and
wailing
the
cry
of
a
broken
bird
heart
pleading
for
wings
and
a
mate
the
great
spirit
heard
his
notes
of
sorrow
but
i
hardened
my
heart
against
the
sacred
bird
for
his
golden
cage
had
been
cunningly
wrought
by
hands
of
such
great
strength
that
naked
they
had
slain
the
mountain
lion
and
taken
its
yellow
skin
for
a
ceremonial
robe
its
fierce
name
for
the
sign
of
a
great
deed
now
i
saw
in
dazed
wonder
that
mountain
lion
had
grown
papoose
hearted
he
was
not
leading
the
hunters
in
the
forest
he
was
not
at
the
head
of
the
fishermen
spearing
and
netting
as
of
old
he
had
proved
his
manhood
in
deadly
combat
he
had
won
his
name
by
the
fiercest
fight
ever
known
among
any
of
our
warriors
but
now
he
chose
to
lie
in
his
wigwam
and
dream
and
i
knew
what
he
dreamed
o
medicine
man
so
with
soft
words
and
pretty
sign
talk
i
led
his
evil
spirit
to
the
bright
late
flower
i
showed
her
the
little
flitting
creatures
and
when
i
helped
her
fill
her
basket
with
sweet
nuts
that
were
greatly
desired
my
ear
quick
for
every
sound
of
menace
marked
the
thing
the
softer
one
did
not
hear
by
a
slender
beckoning
blue
flower
i
measured
the
distance
and
skilfully
i
led
the
other
nut
pickers
far
away
from
the
spot
of
danger
then
i
dared
her
to
race
in
turn
with
me
to
leap
the
long
leap
across
the
nut
bushes
to
land
at
the
mark
of
the
sky
flower
a
fair
thing
to
shelter
death
i
set
down
my
heaped
basket
of
furry
nuts
i
gathered
my
robe
to
my
knees
and
raced
swiftly
i
made
the
leap
to
which
i
challenged
her
before
her
and
all
of
the
wondering
maidens
she
followed
my
footsteps
like
a
rift
of
white
light
she
rose
high
in
the
air
over
the
sweet
nut
bushes
but
she
had
not
my
strength
not
my
purpose
my
leap
carried
me
far
over
the
danger
but
as
i
turned
quickly
to
watch
her
i
saw
her
touch
earth
in
smiling
confidence
at
the
mark
of
the
waving
sky
flower
when
she
tore
away
her
eyes
wide
in
danger
dragging
her
robe
from
the
clinging
thicket
with
greedy
eyed
death
hungry
heart
i
watched
her
proud
face
the
great
spirit
had
not
pitied
me
if
the
curved
death
serpent
had
struck
at
her
his
awful
fangs
had
missed
her
soft
body
o
medicine
man
make
me
magic
for
the
fire
bird
ease
my
spirit
of
the
snaring
water
flower
many
suns
i
waited
in
hunger
and
spirit
searching
far
and
alone
i
wandered
over
the
meadows
beside
the
white
sand
shore
of
the
sea
water
one
day
i
lost
from
my
necklace
a
carved
piece
of
rare
blue
shell
a
beautiful
heaven
tinted
shell
a
treasure
got
from
traders
from
the
islands
of
the
seas
far
to
the
south
of
us
across
vast
waters
a
big
shell
so
precious
among
us
that
only
one
cost
us
the
weaving
of
fifty
blankets
the
greatest
wealth
known
to
our
people
slipping
unseen
from
all
the
others
i
went
alone
through
a
trail
of
deep
forest
to
the
back
of
a
far
secret
cavern
i
knew
where
lay
hidden
my
precious
blue
shell
and
i
cut
one
small
piece
from
it
for
the
mending
of
my
necklace
when
i
came
back
to
the
sun
o
medicine
man
and
through
the
forest
followed
my
trail
i
heard
the
rushing
thunder
footsteps
and
the
death
growl
of
black
bear
i
looked
and
i
saw
at
the
welcoming
cavern
mouth
hurrying
in
from
the
forest
the
bloody
killer
mother
black
bear
gaunt
and
hard
chased
with
far
hanging
tongue
and
foam
dripping
jaws
and
behind
her
panting
and
whimpering
her
pair
of
travel
worn
hungry
little
children
some
far
tribe
had
driven
her
from
her
home
and
with
her
crying
small
ones
following
she
was
seeking
shelter
in
my
treasure
lodge
i
watched
her
turn
and
forbid
her
children
to
enter
alone
bravely
to
the
inner
recesses
she
went
her
nose
must
have
told
her
of
my
recent
body
but
she
could
lead
her
sleepy
cubs
no
farther
for
the
death
weariness
was
upon
all
of
them
so
she
came
back
to
the
cave
homing
mouth
drove
her
panting
cubs
to
the
farthest
wall
and
making
fierce
boastful
war
talk
there
she
claimed
the
homing
rights
of
the
wild
i
went
back
to
where
our
women
were
working
and
i
began
the
brave
task
of
drilling
my
shell
came
and
lay
beside
me
watching
her
tribes
had
no
knowledge
of
such
rare
precious
ornaments
she
greatly
desired
to
possess
one
for
her
most
precious
bracelet
when
we
were
alone
as
i
worked
i
told
her
how
to
find
my
cavern
and
where
the
shell
was
hidden
on
a
high
ledge
her
heart
knew
no
fear
her
eyes
shone
with
gladness
when
i
told
her
my
great
secret
of
blue
treasure
and
that
if
she
would
go
alone
she
might
take
for
herself
one
piece
the
one
i
was
drilling
so
carefully
i
must
use
for
the
mending
of
my
rarest
necklace
when
i
thought
of
the
dripping
jaws
of
the
killer
ravenous
tormented
to
frenzy
and
looked
at
the
smoothness
of
her
body
i
relented
i
knew
mercy
it
was
in
my
softened
heart
to
say
that
the
hunters
must
go
with
her
but
before
my
lips
of
compassion
could
speak
the
words
my
heart
said
with
the
joy
light
shining
on
her
face
she
told
me
in
happy
confidence
i
will
take
but
one
small
piece
to
ornament
my
richest
bracelet
and
i
will
polish
it
smooth
even
as
you
do
and
mountain
lion
shall
carve
it
for
me
o
medicine
man
look
in
mercy
upon
me
darest
say
she
drove
not
her
own
stake
lighted
her
torture
fire
with
fearless
hands
darest
say
she
knew
not
that
mountain
lion
would
now
make
her
our
chieftainess
darest
say
the
buzzing
of
a
swarm
of
maidens
had
not
told
her
many
suns
past
that
mountain
lion
was
my
man
that
he
had
danced
the
mating
dance
of
the
mandanas
with
me
before
the
assembly
in
the
council
house
on
the
night
of
her
coming
among
us
all
that
night
my
eyes
surrounded
her
wigwam
with
first
dawn
ray
she
came
slipping
forth
and
darted
down
the
veiled
trail
that
led
through
the
deep
forest
well
had
i
marked
the
path
that
ran
to
the
cave
mouth
when
she
had
gone
i
closed
the
slender
opening
through
which
i
had
unceasingly
watched
the
moon
long
journey
for
her
and
for
the
first
time
in
many
pitiless
suns
i
fell
into
the
deep
visionless
sleep
of
the
body
tired
past
endurance
it
was
near
evening
when
my
mother
wakened
me
she
told
me
her
eyes
burning
deep
into
mine
how
hunters
in
the
forest
had
found
fleeing
like
a
doe
before
the
furious
black
killer
when
she
fell
her
utmost
strength
exhausted
over
her
raged
the
foaming
black
death
her
beautiful
breast
and
arms
were
forever
shorn
of
their
smoothness
but
she
lived
and
her
hateful
face
of
allurement
her
face
was
untouched
i
knew
what
my
mother
knew
when
she
turned
from
my
doorway
medicine
man
the
killer
had
not
struck
to
the
depth
where
life
tented
she
had
not
sent
my
enemy
to
the
great
spirit
she
had
only
moved
to
compassion
the
heart
in
the
breast
of
mountain
lion
so
that
alone
in
his
canoe
he
speared
the
rare
fish
alone
on
the
mountains
he
sought
the
tender
bird
even
the
bright
flower
the
red
leaf
to
lay
at
her
doorway
love
offering
well
i
knew
that
when
she
was
healed
he
would
stand
tall
and
straight
before
her
and
in
his
fierce
pleading
eyes
she
would
find
the
great
understanding
then
medicine
man
despair
settled
in
my
heart
i
shrivelled
like
the
ungathered
wild
plum
i
burned
with
a
fierce
hot
inward
fire
the
day
came
when
stood
forth
whitely
robed
in
shining
wonder
untouched
in
her
courage
and
her
beauty
save
that
she
hid
her
arms
with
deep
fringes
in
bitterness
of
spirit
i
turned
from
her
i
followed
the
long
lonely
trail
through
the
fringed
blue
flower
meadows
i
lay
beside
the
small
still
waters
of
the
flat
lands
and
i
talked
to
my
sister
the
tall
blue
heron
while
she
hunted
food
among
the
water
flowers
and
i
told
the
wise
old
heron
for
the
easement
of
my
torture
i
told
her
o
medicine
man
this
same
tale
i
tell
you
and
then
medicine
man
the
heron
gave
me
a
sure
sign
she
stalked
to
where
a
great
white
flower
was
resting
in
serene
beauty
like
a
sheaf
of
fallen
moons
upon
the
water
and
from
beneath
the
safety
of
its
shelter
she
picked
out
my
little
frog
brother
so
easily
she
tossed
him
clear
and
high
in
the
air
and
head
first
he
shot
down
her
long
red
gullet
then
she
looked
at
me
questioningly
and
awaited
my
understanding
so
i
slipped
from
my
robe
of
doeskin
and
fighting
my
way
through
the
black
muck
and
the
snares
of
the
entangling
round
leaves
i
gathered
the
white
flower
riding
like
a
spirit
canoe
that
had
sheltered
fatness
for
my
sister
heron
clean
and
white
as
storm
foam
i
washed
it
carefully
on
the
home
trail
i
carried
it
like
a
living
thing
to
my
wigwam
i
took
it
and
i
put
it
in
a
cooking
kettle
overflowing
cold
water
from
mountain
torrent
then
i
waited
for
the
spirit
to
make
me
a
sure
sign
that
night
when
shadow
touched
me
like
a
star
fallen
from
on
high
was
her
beauty
her
eyes
rested
for
the
first
time
on
the
white
flower
of
the
still
waters
on
her
knees
she
made
a
little
medicine
over
it
in
her
throat
she
chanted
a
hushed
song
of
exultation
and
worship
over
the
wonder
beauty
of
the
white
flower
that
she
had
never
known
in
the
far
cold
land
of
the
killimacs
on
her
face
there
was
a
veiling
breath
mist
like
the
softest
ray
from
the
lovers
moon
all
around
her
wrapped
the
blue
light
blanket
that
seemed
to
steal
from
her
body
creeping
through
her
white
robe
then
medicine
man
i
told
her
this
fair
tale
that
i
loved
a
young
brave
son
of
the
mighty
eagle
feather
the
chief
of
a
high
mountain
tribe
far
north
of
us
and
that
when
he
saw
me
in
the
deep
forest
holding
up
high
the
fair
water
flower
the
lure
of
its
white
magic
would
make
in
his
cold
heart
that
strong
medicine
i
needed
to
bring
him
face
to
face
with
me
in
that
great
understanding
which
is
followed
by
union
among
our
tribes
o
medicine
man
i
told
her
by
word
and
by
convincing
sign
talk
that
if
her
heart
ran
soft
as
gold
sweetness
at
the
coming
of
any
of
our
young
braves
and
her
roving
eyes
flew
to
them
searching
for
loving
understanding
until
she
feared
they
would
betray
her
and
the
tongue
of
her
heart
pled
for
them
and
her
willing
hands
thought
sweet
sign
talk
if
she
would
hold
aloft
the
white
flower
that
she
had
gathered
from
the
water
deep
in
the
thickness
of
the
forest
where
none
but
her
brave
could
see
it
it
would
surely
make
for
her
the
great
magic
that
would
draw
him
straight
to
the
flame
of
the
candle
she
set
before
her
wigwam
long
and
long
and
long
again
she
watched
the
white
flower
all
her
heart
melted
at
its
gold
heart
sweetness
and
then
she
looked
deep
into
my
eyes
to
spirit
depths
she
searched
me
carefully
but
pride
would
not
let
me
quail
before
her
she
knew
she
had
barely
missed
the
peril
of
the
death
snake
she
had
sent
hunters
to
bring
its
rattles
for
her
she
knew
she
had
faced
the
red
death
by
the
black
killer
of
the
treasure
cave
yet
was
my
spirit
so
strong
over
her
doubting
that
once
again
in
the
chill
of
early
morning
she
set
her
proud
feet
confidently
on
the
forest
trail
i
pictured
for
her
she
knew
not
how
the
white
flower
of
the
still
water
lifted
to
the
sun
she
knew
not
the
wind
reeds
and
flute
rushes
i
told
her
the
path
her
feet
must
follow
alone
that
when
she
saw
a
white
flower
like
a
rocking
canoe
cradled
by
soft
wind
riding
on
the
breast
of
the
blue
water
she
should
leave
her
robe
in
the
deep
forest
she
should
run
like
the
chased
antelope
and
leap
from
the
sand
shore
to
the
resting
place
of
the
flower
she
should
snatch
it
in
her
hand
hold
it
high
and
swim
back
to
the
red
beach
of
dawning
but
medicine
man
o
medicine
man
i
sent
her
not
on
the
meadow
path
where
the
war
ponies
fattened
i
sent
her
not
to
the
still
black
water
of
the
singing
reeds
and
rushes
where
the
charmed
spirit
flowers
with
sun
hearts
and
snow
faces
spread
in
flocks
like
feeding
gulls
over
the
breast
of
the
dark
waters
medicine
man
i
sent
her
straight
to
that
one
spot
on
the
sands
of
the
great
sea
water
in
the
deep
bay
in
the
sheltered
cove
of
the
soundless
depths
where
every
canawac
knew
there
crouched
waiting
the
hungry
monster
of
the
lazy
sucking
sands
again
i
watched
all
the
moon
time
and
in
the
gold
red
morning
she
slipped
from
her
wigwam
and
entered
the
ancient
forest
soft
as
flame
ascending
swift
as
night
bird
flying
i
circled
past
her
among
my
familiar
tree
brothers
long
before
her
coming
to
the
bay
of
torture
i
dropped
the
snaring
white
flower
fresh
and
lovely
a
convincing
decoy
far
into
the
heart
of
the
pitiless
death
pool
where
the
eager
mouths
of
the
swallowing
sands
embrace
and
draw
quietly
but
so
surely
that
no
strength
of
arm
can
lift
no
power
of
spirit
can
save
their
victim
behind
the
rocks
i
hid
and
waited
in
anguish
i
prayed
to
the
great
spirit
that
the
luring
white
flower
of
wonder
might
rest
on
the
gently
heaving
water
until
the
time
of
the
coming
of
my
enemy
as
i
waited
with
my
eyes
ever
watching
watching
the
wave
cradled
flower
white
as
swan
feathers
through
the
air
shot
the
slim
scarred
form
of
my
hated
enemy
her
slender
feet
touched
the
water
and
went
down
softly
as
a
diving
bird
her
reaching
hand
caught
the
white
flower
surely
she
lifted
her
face
to
the
face
of
the
morning
the
beauty
that
shone
upon
her
was
like
the
beauty
of
the
great
spirit
when
he
had
first
the
vision
of
the
flower
world
and
the
wonder
of
flower
magic
was
sent
to
him
held
the
water
flower
in
high
triumph
she
gazed
at
it
she
laughed
to
it
she
kissed
it
she
laid
it
against
her
glad
face
like
a
papoose
and
chanted
to
it
throaty
words
of
lullaby
then
with
the
other
hand
and
with
her
quick
feet
she
began
swimming
to
reach
the
certain
shore
when
her
light
feet
would
not
lift
to
the
surface
and
her
strong
stroke
would
not
move
her
body
slowly
the
dawn
light
faded
from
her
face
and
a
look
like
the
look
of
a
little
hurt
papoose
came
over
her
in
slow
wonder
a
look
of
surprise
of
doubt
that
her
strength
could
be
unavailing
then
she
struggled
like
an
arrow
stricken
sea
bird
for
the
sure
sands
grip
their
captive
cruelly
then
gray
terrors
came
sweeping
upon
her
and
her
face
was
white
white
as
the
white
flower
that
she
held
at
arm
length
above
her
her
black
oiled
braids
floated
out
on
the
water
while
a
cry
a
shrill
cry
a
high
screaming
cry
the
voice
of
a
wounded
mountain
lion
rang
from
her
lips
in
quivering
terror
i
knew
who
had
carefully
taught
her
to
use
that
cry
in
time
of
trouble
i
knew
that
for
my
brave
she
was
calling
and
i
knew
too
how
the
wood
and
the
water
carried
sound
far
distances
to
wild
ears
i
wondered
if
mountain
lion
were
on
the
water
or
if
he
were
hunting
the
wide
forest
or
if
he
were
drilling
ornaments
of
blue
shell
or
weaving
the
sacred
singing
fire
bird
a
new
wigwam
of
gold
osiers
only
once
she
screamed
that
awful
wild
cry
then
her
struggles
were
the
final
battle
already
her
face
of
anguish
was
even
with
the
treacherous
water
hiding
death
already
her
slender
body
was
forever
encased
one
arm
slowly
beat
the
fair
bay
helplessly
but
even
as
the
gray
terror
closed
in
upon
her
the
stealthy
catlike
death
of
the
waves
and
the
little
famished
mouths
of
sand
the
slow
mealy
strangling
sands
she
bravely
held
aloft
the
white
flower
and
then
medicine
man
i
cared
not
if
he
came
the
mountain
lion
my
faithless
man
the
utmost
reach
of
his
strength
could
not
save
her
he
might
go
down
to
bottomless
depths
with
her
he
might
strive
and
bear
me
down
to
her
come
was
my
just
and
rightful
hour
of
triumph
i
arose
and
went
forth
on
the
white
shore
i
smiled
like
a
mother
upon
her
then
i
pointed
my
finger
i
laughed
in
scorn
i
made
bad
sign
talk
at
her
i
danced
the
braves
triumph
dance
with
song
i
cried
to
her
in
the
exultation
of
victory
he
will
not
come
again
to
you
the
faithless
mountain
lion
my
man
he
who
danced
the
sacred
mating
dance
of
the
mandanas
with
me
in
the
council
lodge
he
who
read
into
my
eyes
the
great
understanding
even
upon
the
night
of
your
coming
among
us
go
thou
back
to
the
evil
spirits
who
sent
thee
until
the
last
wave
overran
her
eyes
the
slim
thing
of
bone
hardness
of
arrow
straightness
and
sureness
of
bird
swiftness
would
not
look
once
upon
me
would
not
plead
with
me
for
mercy
nor
sign
for
help
at
my
hands
when
she
saw
me
she
suddenly
ceased
to
struggle
and
with
her
eyes
fixed
upon
the
white
flower
the
fallen
moon
that
rides
the
still
black
water
she
went
to
bottomless
depths
silently
slowly
slowly
medicine
man
she
sank
until
the
flower
again
rested
on
the
breast
of
the
unconscious
water
then
i
went
into
the
forest
on
her
trail
i
hunted
her
precious
robe
of
snow
white
doeskin
i
rolled
a
heavy
stone
in
its
rich
bead
work
i
carried
it
back
swiftly
and
upon
the
face
of
the
white
flower
slowly
sinking
beneath
the
water
i
threw
it
then
i
knelt
in
cunning
like
the
fox
and
swiftly
working
my
way
backward
with
my
steady
careful
fingers
i
sifted
the
sands
over
our
footsteps
until
i
came
to
the
feather
grass
and
the
dry
leaves
of
the
deep
forest
like
the
hunted
i
ran
to
the
safety
of
my
wigwam
i
buried
myself
in
my
soft
robes
of
satisfaction
my
heart
laughed
in
victory
the
sleep
i
had
lost
for
many
mocking
moons
while
my
brain
thought
snares
now
settled
heavy
like
sickness
upon
me
even
as
i
slept
in
deep
stupor
there
came
dreams
and
yet
again
dreams
but
they
were
not
familiar
dreams
of
the
low
humming
rattler
nor
the
foaming
mouth
of
the
knife
footed
killer
i
dreamed
that
over
my
heart
flamed
and
scorched
and
burned
the
little
sacred
red
bird
while
my
hands
could
not
braid
and
put
the
gay
ornaments
in
my
hair
could
not
put
on
my
robe
could
not
tie
my
moccasins
could
not
lift
food
to
my
hungry
mouth
because
they
were
full
of
the
white
flowers
from
the
land
of
the
still
water
when
the
alarum
cries
sounded
and
the
ponies
feet
thundered
when
the
hunting
dogs
raged
and
shrill
clamour
arose
in
the
camp
my
mother
shook
me
and
long
she
looked
deep
into
my
eyes
and
i
looked
into
her
eyes
and
then
in
the
silent
talk
of
our
tribe
i
made
the
swift
going
down
sign
of
the
monster
sands
of
the
far
bay
there
was
no
triumph
on
her
face
when
she
slowly
turned
from
me
and
fear
was
born
in
my
heart
because
i
clearly
saw
its
awful
image
when
it
sprang
into
life
in
the
deeps
of
her
eyes
when
the
scouts
and
hunters
were
gathering
when
the
visiting
chief
was
threatening
and
all
of
our
chiefs
were
in
secret
council
while
the
women
were
wailing
the
death
cry
there
came
to
my
lodge
in
that
hour
the
footsteps
i
had
always
awaited
so
i
passed
through
my
doorway
and
in
the
revealing
sunlight
i
stood
before
mountain
lion
terrible
to
face
in
his
deep
rage
with
dazed
hand
i
drew
sleep
from
my
eyes
i
met
his
gaze
stupidly
with
smiling
face
when
he
saw
this
he
was
forced
to
doubt
the
thing
he
had
come
expecting
to
see
when
he
tried
to
look
far
into
my
eyes
for
a
sign
he
saw
only
stupid
old
man
sleep
sitting
there
mocking
the
tortured
heart
in
his
breast
then
he
caught
me
fiercely
by
the
shoulders
he
drew
me
close
to
him
he
forced
my
eyes
to
meet
his
and
low
and
hoarse
he
cried
to
me
in
torture
she
jumped
to
the
mark
of
the
sky
flower
and
the
snake
with
death
in
its
mouth
was
there
the
mark
was
the
mark
you
set
for
her
yiada
she
went
to
the
far
lonely
cave
of
the
chased
and
hungry
black
death
and
the
rare
shell
that
she
sought
was
a
part
of
your
treasure
yiada
again
she
is
missing
evil
spirits
know
how
long
what
torture
death
have
you
sent
her
seeking
now
my
brave
fire
bird
my
woman
o
medicine
man
if
he
had
not
said
soft
words
i
might
have
told
him
as
he
held
me
before
him
i
might
have
braved
the
storm
of
his
wrath
and
made
my
journey
to
the
great
spirit
in
that
menacing
breath
when
i
saw
that
she
lived
in
my
place
in
the
secret
tent
of
his
heart
i
laughed
at
him
and
i
cried
tauntingly
she
is
chasing
painted
wings
in
the
pasture
meadows
of
the
valley
she
is
at
the
still
pool
hunting
the
water
flower
she
would
use
its
white
magic
to
snare
your
wild
heart
even
as
she
used
the
red
magic
of
the
fire
bird
go
and
seek
her
o
mighty
hunter
go
and
seek
until
you
find
her
part
iii
yiada
flight
to
the
mandanas
when
the
hunters
had
raced
from
our
village
toward
the
land
of
ice
toward
the
land
of
hot
suns
toward
the
land
of
dawn
and
where
the
sun
dives
in
the
sea
in
the
conflicting
cross
winds
between
the
paths
of
their
going
on
their
stoutest
ponies
rode
the
young
women
and
the
squaws
who
could
be
spared
with
safety
from
the
watch
of
the
campfires
and
the
care
of
the
little
happy
children
illustration
the
wings
of
a
snow
white
sea
swallow
writing
mating
signs
on
the
blue
sky
of
heaven
flashed
his
quick
hands
of
entreaty
in
the
little
love
sign
talk
he
taught
foremost
among
these
i
rode
on
my
fastest
pony
but
to
my
mother
i
made
a
secret
sign
to
remain
in
waiting
by
her
campfire
and
yet
the
swifter
sign
of
the
quick
return
because
i
was
first
in
the
fish
drying
the
berry
picking
of
earth
and
mountain
the
gathering
of
seeds
of
all
kinds
and
the
work
of
the
women
the
other
maidens
went
where
i
sent
them
then
swiftly
i
made
a
wide
circle
and
slipped
back
to
the
lodge
of
my
mother
and
leaving
my
pony
in
the
tented
forest
i
crept
to
the
door
of
my
father
unseen
by
any
of
the
watchers
there
i
lay
in
hiding
while
my
mother
worked
silently
she
rolled
a
bundle
of
my
finest
robes
my
moccasins
my
best
bow
and
full
quiver
big
strips
of
smoked
venison
dried
fish
and
bear
and
deer
meat
nuts
and
tallow
cake
and
dried
berries
and
the
last
little
sweet
meal
cake
that
her
hands
would
ever
make
me
when
old
man
moon
made
soft
talk
in
his
canoe
among
the
clouds
from
the
back
of
the
lodge
of
my
father
i
crept
after
i
had
stood
long
and
again
long
before
my
mother
racked
in
fierce
anguish
and
made
her
many
signs
of
the
great
crossing
for
we
knew
that
never
again
should
i
see
her
we
made
long
straight
talk
between
us
that
when
the
others
returned
from
the
search
i
should
be
missing
as
was
so
that
a
new
search
would
be
made
for
my
body
then
should
she
cry
the
death
wail
through
the
length
of
all
our
village
for
me
and
make
high
prayer
to
the
great
spirit
for
my
safe
crossing
to
the
happy
lands
thus
her
lodge
and
wigwams
and
my
father
and
brothers
would
be
saved
from
all
suspicion
of
treachery
and
to
the
mourning
of
the
great
chief
who
visited
our
campfires
in
confidence
would
be
added
the
wailing
of
our
tribe
for
yiada
i
rode
my
father
swiftest
remaining
pony
i
turned
my
face
between
the
sun
rising
and
the
hot
suns
of
the
south
i
slipped
through
the
forest
and
on
and
on
each
moon
on
and
again
on
fast
and
far
as
the
pony
could
run
i
journeyed
in
the
direction
where
my
mother
had
told
me
lay
the
encampment
of
her
people
the
mandanas
when
the
tired
pony
could
travel
no
farther
i
let
him
feed
and
rest
and
drink
and
then
again
i
rode
moon
after
moon
until
he
grew
lean
as
deep
snow
gray
wolf
when
i
had
eaten
the
last
crumb
of
meal
cake
and
there
was
nothing
left
in
my
bundle
but
tough
strings
of
deer
meat
i
came
one
to
signs
of
the
mandanas
then
o
medicine
man
i
slipped
from
the
pony
and
bathed
carefully
i
oiled
my
body
braided
my
hair
with
ornaments
and
i
put
on
a
snow
white
robe
whose
bleaching
had
been
taught
my
mother
by
as
a
secret
art
i
stripped
the
beads
and
the
obsidian
from
my
heaviest
necklace
for
ceremonials
and
wore
only
the
sky
water
blue
of
the
precious
blue
shell
when
i
looked
into
the
shining
water
above
the
white
sands
of
the
lake
bed
i
saw
in
my
face
great
beauty
like
high
magic
wrought
by
the
fear
painter
the
hunger
moon
the
far
stealthy
journey
the
anxious
heart
beauty
even
greater
than
the
beauty
of
and
so
o
medicine
man
at
fire
lighting
i
rode
into
the
village
the
spies
and
the
couriers
raced
before
me
crying
the
wonder
of
my
coming
the
fierce
snarling
dogs
yapped
after
me
the
frightened
children
ran
from
me
angered
squaws
with
harsh
voices
cried
threatening
forbidding
words
at
me
when
i
came
to
the
door
of
the
council
house
at
the
head
of
the
long
village
of
fatness
i
slipped
from
my
pony
and
leading
him
after
me
i
walked
to
the
feet
of
the
great
chief
sitting
in
solemn
state
on
his
throne
i
gave
him
the
deeps
of
my
troubled
spirit
my
eyes
slowly
unfolded
to
his
eyes
the
tale
of
the
robbed
heart
of
the
tortured
sleep
of
the
lone
moon
trail
of
a
fugitive
from
the
arrows
of
an
enemy
with
mandan
speech
and
by
the
sign
language
i
told
him
that
i
was
of
his
blood
of
his
tribe
through
my
mother
seeking
refuge
with
her
people
and
i
told
him
o
medicine
man
these
things
of
woe
i
now
tell
you
beside
him
came
the
great
chiefs
and
wise
men
around
him
the
warriors
the
spies
and
hunters
while
back
of
the
chiefs
dim
in
the
firelight
again
and
again
i
felt
the
eye
of
a
mighty
hunter
a
young
brave
with
the
broad
shoulders
the
round
face
of
compassion
and
the
softer
eye
of
the
mandanas
of
the
lands
where
peace
homed
securely
little
of
my
story
had
i
told
the
chieftain
as
straight
and
fearless
i
faced
him
before
i
knew
in
my
heart
that
over
his
head
i
was
speaking
to
the
stirred
heart
of
his
son
i
was
asking
of
him
rest
and
meat
and
tribe
rights
even
as
had
asked
meal
and
water
of
mountain
lion
instead
of
our
women
for
the
broken
fire
bird
that
rested
on
her
breast
as
i
asked
i
knew
the
answer
in
his
heart
for
i
was
tall
and
i
was
seasoned
and
i
was
tortured
beyond
bearing
and
i
was
beautiful
with
a
living
spirit
beauty
far
above
that
of
the
mandan
women
around
me
when
they
learned
that
my
mother
was
of
their
tribe
in
her
youth
that
i
had
fled
as
the
hunted
for
cave
rights
they
held
counsel
and
they
set
me
a
tall
wigwam
they
gave
me
the
rich
food
of
a
welcome
guest
and
they
led
me
to
my
wrinkled
gray
grandfather
the
great
council
of
chiefs
and
medicine
men
the
wise
men
and
all
of
the
young
braves
made
mandan
sign
talk
to
hold
me
securely
as
if
born
of
their
tribe
and
village
even
if
mountain
lion
suspected
treachery
and
rode
in
war
paint
against
them
for
vengeance
then
was
my
body
lazy
with
rich
comfort
but
my
spirit
was
gray
ashes
burned
out
by
the
flames
of
the
fire
bird
nesting
in
the
heart
of
my
breast
i
was
all
over
sick
for
my
mother
for
my
brothers
and
my
father
who
loved
me
for
the
clear
sky
the
heavy
clouds
and
the
taunting
water
of
the
restless
sea
for
the
fat
grass
the
flower
valleys
and
the
tall
mountains
with
of
snow
for
the
night
fires
of
village
and
council
lodge
and
the
little
honey
cakes
of
my
mother
while
i
dared
not
even
remember
the
face
of
mountain
lion
agony
as
i
tortured
him
in
derision
and
he
turned
from
me
in
hot
anger
as
the
sign
was
in
the
deep
eyes
of
star
face
son
of
the
great
chief
the
night
of
my
coming
so
it
was
in
the
suns
that
followed
well
i
knew
that
in
the
day
when
he
saw
candle
lighting
in
my
eyes
his
willing
feet
would
dance
before
me
the
hated
love
dance
of
the
mandanas
he
was
a
broad
brave
a
fierce
brave
a
warrior
he
would
sit
at
the
council
in
the
seat
of
his
father
when
he
had
made
his
last
journey
to
the
far
spirit
lands
of
final
peace
his
would
be
warm
with
the
skins
of
beaver
mink
and
otter
while
the
white
dress
of
a
great
princess
from
the
bleached
and
softened
doeskin
beaded
with
the
sign
of
the
chief
mate
would
cover
my
sick
heart
with
the
robe
of
pride
so
hard
i
worked
o
medicine
man
from
the
lifting
to
the
setting
of
every
sun
so
long
i
danced
at
night
in
the
assembly
lodge
that
when
i
walked
to
my
wigwam
sleep
came
swift
and
deep
upon
me
sometimes
i
lay
visionless
my
body
worn
to
stone
heaviness
sometimes
the
flaming
bird
burned
my
breast
to
gray
ashes
like
dead
campfires
and
the
white
lilies
overflowed
my
unwilling
hands
until
i
fought
to
keep
from
choking
among
them
even
as
was
smothered
by
the
little
yielding
wave
hidden
sands
when
i
had
worked
that
season
until
the
troubling
mating
moon
sailed
like
a
polished
pearl
canoe
in
the
spring
sky
when
the
hurrying
blood
of
the
trees
ran
fast
in
the
red
and
yellow
osiers
when
the
birches
givers
of
large
gifts
put
out
their
little
talking
leaves
of
gold
when
strange
birds
made
love
chase
in
the
forest
and
the
fish
leaped
high
from
the
shallow
water
as
the
yellow
spawn
they
planted
and
quickened
there
came
a
night
of
quivering
moon
magic
when
after
all
the
others
had
assembled
star
face
entered
the
council
lodge
his
head
lifted
to
face
the
star
country
and
the
great
wealth
of
his
riches
rode
flauntingly
from
to
moccasins
he
had
scoured
his
skin
to
fatling
softness
he
had
oiled
his
body
to
birch
bark
smoothness
his
braided
hair
was
filled
with
eagle
feathers
with
quill
feathers
of
white
swan
and
wing
pinions
of
wild
turkey
he
was
robed
in
the
soft
gray
skins
of
the
otter
on
his
feet
were
beaded
moccasins
of
deerskin
in
his
hand
was
a
broad
fan
of
the
wing
feathers
of
the
proud
and
contented
white
swan
round
his
neck
lay
heavy
shining
ornaments
made
from
the
teeth
and
the
cutting
claws
of
many
black
and
brown
bear
of
fierce
mountain
lion
and
wildcat
and
the
big
teeth
of
the
elk
and
moose
carved
copper
and
cunningly
pierced
bone
beads
from
obsidian
and
little
singing
shells
the
dance
of
the
maidens
was
beginning
when
he
entered
in
high
pride
he
came
through
the
long
lodge
and
stood
with
compelling
eye
before
me
and
before
his
father
on
the
throne
and
his
mother
his
brothers
and
sisters
the
whole
council
of
chiefs
and
wise
men
and
all
the
assembled
people
of
his
tribe
slowly
he
began
the
mating
dance
of
the
mandana
who
would
prevail
while
his
eyes
like
coals
from
the
campfire
seared
my
body
to
action
the
eyes
of
black
bear
when
he
is
facing
the
hunter
the
fierce
eyes
of
the
starving
panther
when
the
hunger
moon
is
shining
the
scouting
eyes
of
the
eagle
of
high
spaces
seeking
a
mate
in
the
far
country
of
the
stars
when
he
had
danced
the
dance
of
allurement
to
the
last
stamped
out
measure
straightway
i
walked
to
the
feet
of
his
powerful
father
on
his
throne
and
in
the
speech
of
the
mandanas
i
said
to
him
great
chief
thou
hast
seen
the
dance
of
thy
mighty
son
star
face
if
i
dance
the
ancient
mating
dance
of
the
unconquered
mandanas
this
night
before
thee
for
star
face
even
as
he
has
danced
before
thee
for
me
great
and
powerful
chief
am
i
of
thy
people
the
great
chief
looked
into
my
eyes
and
said
thou
art
of
mine
even
as
star
face
is
my
son
with
our
last
arrow
with
our
last
battle
axe
with
the
stoutest
blood
of
our
hearts
will
our
braves
defend
thee
forever
the
next
sun
the
young
women
set
me
a
tall
prideful
wigwam
apart
they
bathed
and
oiled
my
heart
sick
body
they
beaded
and
feathered
fine
robes
for
the
mating
ceremonials
of
a
rich
brave
in
another
tent
all
of
the
young
men
were
busy
preparing
star
face
for
our
union
down
the
long
wide
trail
of
the
swarming
bee
like
village
the
painted
criers
on
swift
horses
were
announcing
the
marriage
of
yiada
daughter
of
the
far
and
friendly
canawacs
and
star
face
the
son
of
the
head
chief
of
the
boastful
mandanas
the
proud
ones
so
with
the
full
mandan
ceremonial
i
gave
my
tortured
body
to
star
face
there
was
no
heart
left
in
me
o
medicine
man
and
that
star
face
might
not
miss
it
when
he
looked
in
my
eyes
in
tenderness
i
gave
to
him
such
willing
and
sure
service
as
no
other
chief
of
the
mandanas
had
ever
known
soft
were
the
skins
that
bedded
his
wigwams
warm
his
against
the
sting
of
winter
sweet
was
the
crisp
squaw
bread
that
bubbled
in
his
fat
kettles
gold
was
the
mountain
of
tallow
stacked
in
his
storehouse
for
winter
high
heaped
were
the
nuts
of
tree
and
bush
gathered
and
husked
against
the
ice
chief
rich
were
the
berries
dried
with
sunshine
boiled
back
to
tenderness
honey
sweetened
and
medicine
man
no
other
brave
served
his
mate
as
star
face
high
and
boastful
was
his
pride
when
i
gave
him
a
straight
little
chieftain
and
great
to
pain
was
my
joy
when
i
oiled
the
little
fatling
for
the
fire
ever
burning
in
my
heart
had
not
scorched
his
small
body
the
fulness
of
my
hands
had
set
no
mark
upon
him
he
was
a
young
chieftain
of
spirit
magic
who
in
suns
before
his
coming
to
my
lodge
had
ridden
on
the
backs
of
milk
white
fawns
over
the
floating
thistle
seed
trail
that
we
saw
nightly
in
the
country
of
the
stars
who
had
played
with
baby
beavers
in
their
village
at
the
creek
mouth
who
had
hunted
canyon
ways
stout
heart
with
bear
and
panther
who
had
sailed
over
tall
mountains
with
the
eagle
who
had
hung
in
the
eye
of
the
sun
with
the
silver
winged
falcon
who
had
fished
angry
waters
with
the
crafty
mink
who
had
raced
among
the
white
birches
with
the
soft
eyed
does
of
spring
and
slept
deep
with
his
tall
blue
heron
brothers
in
their
rough
nests
among
the
wailing
cedars
every
sun
i
watched
him
every
moon
my
hand
was
on
him
ever
his
gay
cradle
was
light
in
my
eye
its
tinkling
shells
sweet
music
in
my
ears
when
he
could
walk
with
strength
i
led
him
to
the
meadows
to
the
forest
and
i
taught
him
thou
knowest
o
medicine
man
thou
knowest
well
how
carefully
i
taught
him
our
every
custom
and
tradition
and
how
star
face
trained
him
with
the
bow
to
fish
the
rough
waters
to
ride
the
wild
ponies
and
how
he
taught
him
all
the
laws
and
customs
for
young
braves
who
would
be
warriors
thou
knowest
how
all
of
the
tribe
shouted
when
first
he
sat
his
pony
alone
and
rode
it
through
the
village
at
its
racing
speed
and
then
o
medicine
man
thou
knowest
the
day
when
first
he
strayed
far
from
me
with
the
little
curious
feet
of
childhood
and
now
now
i
hear
the
wild
shrieks
of
terror
when
the
snake
that
has
death
in
its
mouth
struck
its
pitiless
fangs
into
his
tender
flesh
when
his
little
blanket
wrapped
body
looking
so
long
and
straight
and
lonely
was
carried
to
the
far
haunted
death
village
all
the
forest
echoed
wild
cries
of
mourning
from
a
thousand
wigwams
of
desolation
and
that
loved
him
my
stiff
lips
made
no
sound
my
robbed
hands
lay
death
captive
for
my
eyes
saw
again
the
nut
thicket
and
the
thing
the
sky
flower
sheltered
my
ears
again
heard
the
soft
buzzing
menace
well
i
knew
that
had
escaped
the
watchful
great
spirit
that
she
had
come
back
to
earth
to
strike
me
through
the
death
snake
that
hers
were
the
fangs
of
poison
buried
deep
in
my
little
fatling
thou
knowest
medicine
man
how
another
little
chief
came
to
me
and
how
again
with
all
the
wild
magic
all
the
wisdom
of
our
tribe
all
the
strength
in
our
power
and
the
cunning
of
our
hearts
of
love
the
great
star
face
and
i
his
strong
mate
strove
over
the
life
of
our
son
thou
knowest
how
he
shouted
when
to
us
there
came
a
little
sister
and
then
the
black
day
that
dread
day
thou
knowest
well
as
any
when
tall
and
straight
he
entered
the
forest
alone
to
strive
for
the
first
vision
from
the
great
spirit
without
food
and
without
sleep
i
knelt
silent
in
my
lonely
wigwam
with
one
hand
ever
easing
my
burning
breast
with
the
other
i
fought
back
the
slowly
rising
tide
of
the
white
flowers
the
luring
spirit
flowers
of
destruction
that
home
on
the
still
lake
waters
i
needed
not
the
chilling
death
cry
that
came
to
my
ears
three
suns
later
i
knew
surely
that
my
little
chieftain
would
not
come
back
to
me
from
the
forest
he
still
breathed
when
the
hunters
brought
before
me
his
stout
body
ripped
deep
by
the
cruel
knives
of
the
killer
the
black
death
man
height
and
buffalo
heavy
lay
dead
in
the
far
uptorn
pitying
forest
where
they
had
battled
for
their
lives
it
had
been
the
greatest
fight
that
youth
had
ever
waged
in
our
tribe
all
night
the
anxious
medicine
men
made
their
strongest
medicine
for
him
but
the
green
sickness
was
eating
his
slender
body
in
the
morning
o
medicine
man
again
danced
her
triumph
dance
again
scored
victory
over
me
when
our
unavailing
death
wail
beat
against
the
copper
face
of
heaven
for
my
little
chieftain
my
brave
little
warrior
because
of
her
pointing
finger
no
cry
would
i
utter
silently
in
my
tortured
wigwam
i
writhed
in
the
flame
of
the
fire
bird
and
choked
with
the
rising
sick
sweetness
of
the
hated
water
flower
of
the
pasture
lands
but
ever
i
held
in
a
tight
grasp
the
clutching
hand
of
little
fat
face
and
my
ears
ached
with
her
shrill
wail
for
the
long
journey
of
her
brother
for
she
had
ridden
his
racing
pony
before
him
on
the
saddle
on
far
trails
and
gathered
gay
flowers
in
the
valleys
on
the
coloured
faces
of
high
hills
and
brought
me
the
little
juicy
birds
from
the
snares
of
cunning
set
in
the
valleys
and
chased
the
war
painted
wings
where
the
hunting
ponies
pastured
medicine
man
o
medicine
man
darest
say
i
had
not
killing
torture
when
the
burning
of
the
fire
bird
was
past
bearing
when
the
stifling
cloud
of
the
white
flowers
sickened
my
body
to
leanness
i
arose
and
began
skin
dressing
and
fish
drying
and
seed
grinding
and
weaving
blankets
all
of
the
squaws
and
the
young
women
pointed
taunting
mischievous
fingers
when
silent
i
passed
among
them
they
said
she
is
possessed
of
a
devil
evil
spirits
drive
her
with
secret
arrows
it
is
with
strength
stolen
from
the
spirits
that
she
works
every
sun
at
the
fish
drying
the
meat
curing
the
seed
gathering
and
the
making
of
tents
not
needed
but
ever
when
far
grown
i
carried
little
dove
eye
little
cooing
bird
on
my
aching
shoulders
ever
i
pressed
her
against
my
burning
heart
i
would
not
trust
her
to
the
stoutest
cradle
tightly
i
held
her
that
from
my
fear
strong
hands
she
might
not
be
pushed
out
by
the
white
flowers
when
her
stumbling
little
feet
of
uncertainty
carried
her
to
the
willing
knees
of
star
face
like
the
first
dawn
of
spring
long
awaited
came
the
light
to
his
hungry
eyes
like
the
soft
talking
brook
water
came
the
sweet
words
in
his
throat
like
the
wings
of
a
snow
white
sea
swallow
writing
mating
signs
on
the
blue
sky
of
heaven
flashed
his
quick
hands
of
entreaty
in
the
little
love
sign
talk
he
taught
her
many
suns
he
sat
grinding
small
beads
of
bone
every
little
rare
white
shell
he
found
and
polishing
squirrel
and
otter
teeth
for
the
necklace
she
wore
so
proudly
never
did
i
leave
my
hands
free
of
her
unless
the
hands
of
star
face
were
upon
her
when
he
made
signs
of
soft
i
made
signs
of
the
passing
of
spirits
so
he
saw
that
my
hands
ever
upon
her
were
only
that
i
might
hold
her
back
from
the
land
of
the
great
unseen
for
only
these
three
medicine
man
only
these
three
little
people
the
great
spirit
sent
to
my
lodge
from
the
far
land
of
cradle
filling
always
when
we
came
near
still
or
running
water
i
held
her
with
the
hug
of
black
bear
before
she
might
chase
the
little
fishes
even
in
the
shallow
inshore
water
of
the
bays
or
hunt
the
clinging
mussel
for
food
or
bathe
with
the
small
people
i
went
before
her
every
step
and
always
my
feet
were
feeling
searching
for
any
sign
of
the
sands
of
treachery
in
my
heart
i
said
they
shall
not
have
her
the
ravenous
monster
mouths
they
shall
not
have
her
the
pitiless
death
sands
thou
knowest
medicine
man
the
season
of
the
great
when
i
was
needed
at
the
fires
roasting
deer
meat
when
i
was
needed
to
set
the
forest
of
wigwams
for
seven
tribes
seeking
our
welcome
when
i
was
needed
to
make
swift
preparation
to
use
all
the
store
of
my
knowledge
for
the
coming
of
a
cloud
of
peoples
from
far
countries
to
our
village
to
teach
us
of
their
experience
and
to
learn
of
our
wisdom
from
us
thou
knowest
that
day
medicine
man
the
greatest
day
of
the
life
of
our
nation
i
held
little
dove
eye
tight
then
set
her
on
the
pony
of
star
face
before
him
that
she
might
ride
to
meet
the
friendly
people
thou
knowest
how
she
danced
to
him
and
beat
her
little
hands
in
triumph
how
she
snatched
at
the
sunbeams
and
fluttered
her
fingers
to
me
like
the
flying
painted
wings
honey
gathering
over
the
valley
pastures
how
she
made
me
the
sign
of
birds
far
flying
when
she
rode
away
at
the
head
of
our
braves
on
the
proud
pony
of
star
face
thou
knowest
how
again
and
again
harshly
i
made
the
sign
of
full
cradling
arms
of
tight
holding
of
unsleeping
spying
to
star
face
as
he
left
me
all
day
the
fire
bird
burned
my
heart
all
day
i
heard
his
prison
song
i
stopped
work
at
the
smoking
baking
stones
to
push
back
the
hated
water
flowers
like
fulling
wool
from
the
wild
sheep
back
ever
i
pleadingly
prayed
the
great
spirit
to
have
her
in
his
safe
keeping
and
thou
knowest
how
the
mighty
chiefs
rode
with
bowed
sorrowing
heads
before
me
thou
knowest
how
star
face
my
man
stood
stricken
and
mourning
at
our
doorway
his
empty
hands
turned
down
in
sign
of
torture
thou
knowest
the
tale
the
old
wise
man
made
of
how
her
glad
voice
chanted
with
the
birds
and
her
little
hands
clamoured
and
begged
when
they
passed
the
white
flowered
still
pool
the
magic
ornament
of
the
valley
breast
where
first
she
saw
the
flowers
of
dawn
growing
thou
knowest
how
she
whimpered
how
she
reached
pleading
hungry
hands
how
she
fought
to
be
put
down
to
pick
them
on
his
pony
left
her
with
the
braves
while
he
made
the
welcome
sign
talk
to
the
visitors
while
he
spoke
the
brothers
friendly
greeting
while
he
smoked
the
contented
peace
pipe
that
warmed
the
hearts
of
our
visitors
thou
knowest
how
she
turned
his
war
pony
and
flew
back
over
the
trail
wind
driven
thou
knowest
how
the
frightened
hunters
rode
at
racing
speed
to
catch
her
and
how
they
saw
only
one
little
hand
not
yet
swallowed
by
the
sand
mouths
the
living
sign
of
coming
mourning
tightly
clutching
the
white
flower
of
destruction
with
its
lying
heart
of
the
gold
of
happiness
and
thou
knowest
how
three
of
our
young
braves
went
down
in
the
fierce
sand
mouths
fighting
with
full
man
strength
to
save
her
until
the
mighty
chief
her
grandfather
cried
it
is
enough

great
spirit
has
spoken

has
taken
her
