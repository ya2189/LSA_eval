and
to
time
said
be
true
in
answer
to
which
they
with
pleasure
replied
that
they
surely
be
there
at
the
time
specified
in
the
very
best
manner
without
the
least
doubt
the
hosts
the
grand
banquet
spread

pride
in
the
midst
of
a
wood
a
mushroom
grew
there
which
a
nice
table
made
and
a
for
the
cloth
was
soon
laid
when
the
moment
arrived
ready
waiting
were
they
to
welcome
their
friends
in
the

way

black
who
carried
the
emmet
his
friend
on
his

gnat
and
the
dragonfly
next
did
each
bring
his
friends
then
the
wasp
came

sharp
sting

cockchafer
hummed
as
he
journeyed
along
some
songs
he
intended
to
sing
to
the
throng
the
sly
little
dormouse
peeped
out
of
his
hole
and
led
to
the
feast

blind
cousin

mole

fact
they
all
came

viands

various
delighted
were
they
some
honey
the
bee
brought
to
honor
the
day
said
he
my
dear
friends
i
am
far
behind
time
but
work
before
play
is
a
maxim
of
mine
the
feast
now
commenced
they
ate
and
they
talked
of
the
news
of
the
day
and
the
distance
they
walked
when
the
banquet
was
finished
they
said
one
and
all
that
gaffer
grasshopper
must
open
the
ball
illustration
behold
him
then
bowing
politely
advance
to
ask
madam
butterfly

dance
the
dancing
began
each
a
partner
had
got
excepting
the
snail
who
said
dance
she
could
not
for
fatigued
with
the
distance
the
length
of
an
ell
she
said
she
must
sleep
in
her
own
little
shell
the
party
was
merry
and
well
it
might
be
for
the
cockchafer
sang
and
a
soft
voice
had
he
illustration
the
name
of
the
song
i
forgotten
completely
and
also
the
words
but
they
sounded
most
sweetly
the
company
charmed
entreated
another
and
he
favored
them
gladly
with
jack
and
his
brother
when
ended
the
song
it
was
loudly
applauded
the
dance
for
a
time
again
