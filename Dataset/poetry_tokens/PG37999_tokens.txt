poems
in
this
collection
introduction
arthur
macy
was
a
nantucket
boy
of
quaker
extraction
his
name
alone
is
evidence
of
this
for
it
is
safe
to
say
that
a
macy
wherever
found
in
the
united
states
is
descended
from
that
sturdy
old
quaker
who
was
one
of
those
who
bought
nantucket
from
the
indians
paid
them
fairly
for
it
treated
them
with
justice
and
lived
on
friendly
terms
with
them
in
many
ways
arthur
macy
showed
that
he
was
a
nantucketer
and
at
least
by
descent
a
quaker
he
often
used
phrases
peculiar
to
our
island
in
the
sea
and
was
given
in
conversation
at
least
to
similes
which
smacked
of
salt
water
almost
the
last
time
i
saw
him
he
said
i
coming
round
soon
for
a
good
long
gam
he
was
a
man
in
his
intercourse
with
a
friend
like
myself
he
would
show
the
side
which
he
thought
would
interest
me
and
that
only
he
was
above
all
things
cheery
and
to
his
praise
be
it
said
he
hated
a
bore
i
remember
that
a
mutual
friend
was
talking
baseball
to
me
by
the
yard
arthur
was
sitting
by
listening
it
was
a
subject
in
which
he
was
much
interested
nevertheless
turning
to
our
mutual
friend
he
said
do
talk
baseball
to
he
do
care
anything
about
it
he
do
know
anything
about
it
and
he
do
want
to
on
the
other
hand
although
little
given
to
telling
of
his
war
experiences
he
was
always
ready
to
talk
over
the
old
days
with
me
of
what
he
did
himself
he
modestly
said
but
little
but
of
the
services
of
others
more
especially
of
the
men
in
the
ranks
he
was
generous
in
his
praise
early
in
the
war
macy
enlisted
in
company
b
michigan
volunteer
infantry
he
was
twice
wounded
on
the
first
day
at
gettysburg
and
managed
to
crawl
into
the
town
and
get
as
far
as
the
steps
of
the
court
house
which
was
fast
filling
with
wounded
from
both
sides
his
sense
of
humor
was
in
evidence
even
at
such
a
time
a
confederate
officer
rode
up
and
asked
have
those
men
in
there
got
arms
quick
as
a
flash
macy
answered
some
of
them
have
and
some
of
them
have
he
remained
in
this
hospital
a
prisoner
within
the
confederate
lines
until
the
battle
was
over
and
lee
army
retreated
all
wounded
prisoners
who
could
walk
were
forced
to
go
with
them
but
macy
wound
was
in
the
foot
and
fortunately
for
him
he
was
spared
the
horrors
of
a
southern
prison
he
was
on
duty
later
at
the
naval
academy
hospital
in
annapolis
presided
over
by
vanderkieft
perhaps
as
efficient
a
general
hospital
administrator
as
the
army
had
i
knew
vanderkieft
very
well
and
was
on
duty
at
his
hospital
when
the
exchanged
prisoners
came
back
from
andersonville
although
macy
and
i
never
met
there
it
came
out
in
our
talk
that
we
were
there
at
the
same
time
he
served
his
full
three
years
and
was
honorably
discharged
about
the
close
of
the
war
it
is
given
to
but
few
to
have
the
keen
sense
of
humor
which
he
possessed
quick
and
keen
at
repartee
he
never
practised
it
save
when
worth
while
he
never
said
the
clearly
obvious
thing
failing
something
better
than
that
he
held
his
peace
had
it
not
been
for
his
disinclination
to
publish
his
verses
he
long
ago
would
have
had
a
national
reputation
his
reason
for
this
disinclination
as
i
gathered
from
many
talks
with
him
was
that
he
did
not
consider
his
work
of
sufficiently
high
standard
every
one
praised
his
choice
of
words
his
wonderful
facility
in
rhyme
the
perfection
of
his
metre
and
the
daintiness
and
delicacy
of
his
verse
all
right
he
would
say
but
that
is
not
poetry
with
a
big
p
and
that
is
the
only
kind
that
should
be
published
and
there
is
mighty
little
of
it
it
is
fortunate
that
this
severe
judgment
creditable
as
it
was
to
him
is
not
to
prevail
lovers
of
the
beautiful
are
not
to
be
robbed
of
sit
closer
friends
nor
of
a
poet
lesson
and
many
who
never
heard
of
that
remarkable
spanish
pachyderm
will
take
delight
in
the
story
of
the
rollicking
mastodon
whose
home
was
in
the
trunk
of
a
tranquil
tree
the
greater
part
of
his
verses
with
which
i
am
familiar
i
heard
at
papyrus
club
dinners
he
was
an
early
member
and
one
of
the
most
esteemed
he
was
fairly
sure
to
have
something
in
his
pocket
and
the
presiding
officer
never
called
upon
him
in
vain
it
was
so
at
the
saint
botolph
club
of
which
he
was
long
a
member
whenever
there
was
an
occasion
when
the
need
of
verse
seemed
indicated
arthur
macy
could
be
counted
on
his
saint
botolph
which
has
become
the
club
song
and
will
be
sung
as
long
as
the
club
endures
was
written
for
a
twelfth
night
revel
at
my
request
it
has
a
peculiarly
old
english
flavor
he
makes
of
the
saint
not
the
jolly
friar
nor
yet
the
severe
recluse
but
just
a
good
kind
old
man
who
was
loved
by
the
sinners
and
loved
by
the
good
one
who
was
certain
that
there
must
be
sin
so
long
as
a
few
get
the
loaves
and
many
get
the
crumbs
and
some
are
born
fingers
and
some
are
born
thumbs
and
here
we
get
a
glimpse
of
arthur
macy
view
of
life
which
was
certainly
broad
and
generous
with
a
philosophic
flavor
arthur
macy
had
a
business
side
of
which
his
club
intimates
had
but
slight
knowledge
he
represented
in
new
england
one
of
the
great
commercial
agencies
of
the
country
his
knowledge
of
business
men
of
their
standing
commercially
and
financially
was
extended
and
intimate
and
was
relied
upon
by
our
merchants
and
others
as
a
basis
for
giving
credit
his
office
work
required
the
closest
attention
to
details
and
the
exercise
of
the
most
careful
judgment
the
whole
success
of
such
a
company
as
that
which
he
represented
depends
upon
the
reliability
of
the
information
which
it
gives
without
this
it
has
no
reason
for
existence
it
was
to
arthur
macy
that
the
merchants
of
boston
largely
turned
for
information
concerning
their
customers
scattered
throughout
new
england
and
it
was
because
of
his
success
in
obtaining
such
information
and
his
thorough
knowledge
of
the
business
in
all
its
details
that
the
superior
officers
of
the
company
placed
such
implicit
confidence
in
his
judgment
and
so
high
a
value
upon
his
advice
and
in
the
conduct
of
this
business
he
showed
his
quaker
straightforwardness
his
work
was
not
at
all
of
the
detective
sort
if
information
was
wanted
concerning
a
man
business
by
those
who
had
dealings
with
him
macy
went
directly
to
the
man
himself
and
told
him
that
it
was
for
his
own
best
interest
to
show
just
where
he
stood
and
above
all
things
to
tell
the
exact
truth
honest
men
had
the
truth
told
about
them
and
profited
by
it
dishonest
men
and
secretive
men
were
passed
over
in
severe
silence
and
their
credit
suffered
accordingly
few
of
those
who
sought
arthur
macy
for
business
information
ever
suspected
that
they
were
talking
to
a
poet
and
man
of
letters
i
have
not
sought
to
tell
arthur
macy
life
story
neither
have
i
entered
upon
any
detailed
consideration
of
his
verse
it
is
for
the
reader
to
peruse
the
pages
that
follow
and
draw
his
own
conclusion
i
have
merely
tried
to
give
a
glimpse
of
the
characteristics
of
one
of
the
most
charming
personalities
i
ever
knew

doubt
me
if

comprehends
he

in

is
there
no

the
jocund

can

utterly
destroy

no

can
it
be
that

oh
scholars

we

call
who
solve
great
questions
at

ease
we
ask
the
simplest
of

and
yet
you

these
and
is
it
thus
your

ends

comfort
friends
dear
omar
should
you
chance
to
meet
our
brother
somewhere
in
the
gloom
pray
give
to
him
a
message
sweet
from
brothers
in
the
tavern
room
he
will
not
ask
who
is
that
sends
for
we
were
friends
again
a
parting
sail
we
see
another
boat
has
left
the
shore
a
kinder
soul
on
board
has
she
than
ever
left
the
land
before
and
as
her
outward
course
she
bends
sit
closer
friends
the
old
café
you
know
do
you
joe
those
merry
evenings
long
ago
you
know
the
room
the
narrow
stair
the
wreaths
of
smoke
that
circled
there
the
corner
table
where
we
sat
for
hours
in
chat
and
magnified
our
little
world
inside
you
know
do
you
joe
ah
those
nights
divine
the
simple
frugal
wine
the
airs
on
crude
italian
strings
the
joyous
harmless
revelings
just
fit
for
us
or
kings
at
times
a
quaint
and
wickered
flask
of
rare
chianti
or
from
the
homelier
cask
of
modest
pilsener
a
stein
or
so
amid
the
merry
talk
would
flow
or
red
bordeaux
from
vines
that
grew
where
dear
montaigne
held
his
domain
and
you
remember
that
dark
eye
none
too
shy
in
fact
she
seemed
a
bit
too
free
for
you
and
me
you
know
do
you
joe
then
pegasus
i
knew
and
then
i
read
to
you
my
callow
rhymes
so
many
many
times
and
something
in
the
place
lent
them
a
certain
grace
until
i
scarce
believed
them
mine
under
the
magic
of
the
wine
but
now
i
read
them
and
see
grave
faults
i
had
not
seen
before
and
wonder
how
you
could
have
listened
with
such
placid
brow
and
somehow
apprehend
you
sank
the
critic
in
the
friend
you
know
do
you
joe
and
when
we
talked
of
books
how
learned
were
our
looks
and
few
the
bards
we
could
not
quote
from
gay
catullus
lines
to
milton
purer
note
mayhap
we
now
are
wiser
men
but
we
knew
more
than
all
the
scholars
then
and
our
conceit
was
grand
ineffable
complete
we
know
do
we
joe
gone
are
those
golden
nights
of
innocent
bohemian
delights
and
we
are
getting
on
and
anon
years
sad
and
tremulous
may
be
in
store
for
us
but
should
we
ever
meet
upon
some
quiet
street
and
you
discover
in
an
old
man
eye
some
transient
sparkle
of
the
days
gone
by
then
you
will
guess
perchance
the
meaning
of
the
glance
you
know
wo
you
joe
at
at
marliave
when
eventide
finds
rare
companions
at
my
side
the
laughter
of
each
merry
guest
at
quaint
conceit
or
kindly
jest
makes
golden
moments
swiftly
glide
no
voice
unkind
our
faults
to
chide
our
smallest
virtue
magnified
and
friendly
hand
to
hand
is
pressed
at
marliave
i
lay
my
years
and
cares
aside
accepting
what
the
gods
provide
i
ask
not
for
a
lot
more
blest
nor
do
i
crave
a
sweeter
rest
than
that
which
comes
with
eventide
at
marliave
the
passing
of
the
rose
a
white
rose
said
how
fair
am
i
behold
a
flower
that
can
not
die
a
lover
brushed
the
dew
aside
and
fondly
plucked
it
for
his
bride
a
fitting
choice
the
white
rose
cried
the
maiden
wore
it
in
her
hair
the
rose
contented
to
be
there
still
proudly
boasted
none
so
fair
then
close
she
pressed
it
to
her
lips
but
weary
of
companionships
the
flower
within
her
bosom
slips
by
all
the
beauty
there
it
straight
confessed
dear
maid
i
swear
is
you
and
you
alone
are
fair
turning
its
humbled
head
aside
the
envious
rose
lamenting
died
a
valentine
from
a
very
little
boy
to
a
very
little
girl
this
is
a
valentine
for
you
mother
made
it
she
real
smart
i
told
her
that
i
loved
you
true
and
you
were
my
sweetheart
and
then
she
smiled
and
then
she
winked
and
then
she
said
to
father
beginning
young
and
then
he
thinked
and
then
he
said
well
rather
then
mother
eyes
began
to
shine
and
then
she
made
this
valentine
if
you
love
me
as
i
love
you
no
knife
shall
cut
our
love
in
two
and
father
laughed
and
said
how
new
and
then
he
said
it
time
for
bed
so
when
i
said
my
prayers
mother
came
running
up
the
stairs
and
told
me
i
might
send
the
rhymes
and
then
she
kissed
me
lots
of
times
then
i
turned
over
to
the
wall
and
cried
about
you
and
that
all
disenchantment
time
and
i
have
fallen
out
we
who
were
such
steadfast
friends
so
slowly
has
it
come
about
that
none
may
tell
when
it
began
yet
sure
am
i
a
cunning
plan
runs
through
it
all
and
now
beyond
recall
our
friendship
ends
and
ending
there
remains
to
me
the
memory
of
disloyalty
long
years
ago
time
tripping
came
with
promise
grand
and
sweet
assurances
of
fame
and
hand
in
hand
through
went
he
and
i
together
in
bright
and
golden
weather
then
then
i
had
not
learned
to
doubt
for
friends
were
gods
and
faith
was
sure
and
words
were
truth
and
deeds
were
pure
before
we
had
our
falling
out
and
life
all
hope
was
fair
to
see
when
time
made
promise
sweet
to
me
when
first
my
faithless
friend
grew
cold
i
sought
to
knit
a
closer
bond
but
he
less
fond
sad
days
and
years
upon
me
rolled
pressed
me
with
care
with
envy
tinged
the
boyhood
hair
and
ploughed
unwelcome
furrows
in
where
none
had
been
in
vain
i
begged
with
trembling
lip
for
our
old
sweet
companionship
and
saw
prayers
and
tears
devout
the
presage
of
our
falling
out
and
now
i
know
time
has
no
friends
nor
pity
lends
but
touches
all
with
heavy
finger
soon
or
late
and
as
we
wait
the
reaper
call
the
sickle
fatal
sweep
we
strive
in
vain
to
keep
one
truth
inviolate
one
cherished
fancy
free
from
doubt
it
was
not
so
long
years
ago
before
we
had
our
falling
out
if
time
would
come
again
to
me
and
once
more
take
me
by
the
hand
for
golden
walks
through
i
could
forgive
the
treachery
that
stole
my
youth
and
what
of
truth
was
mine
to
know
nor
would
i
more
his
love
misdoubt
and
i
would
throw
my
arms
around
him
so
that
he
forgive
the
falling
out
constancy
i
first
saw
phebe
when
the
had
just
made
brighter
all
the
yet
she
was
fair
as
any
there
and
so
i
loved
her
hours
and
hours
then
i
met
helen
and
her
ways
set
my
untutored
heart
ablaze
i
loved
at
sight
and
deemed
it
right
to
worship
her
for
days
and
days
yet
when
i
gazed
on
clara
cheeks
and
spoke
the
language
cupid
speaks
all
the
rest
she
seemed
the
best
and
so
i
loved
her
weeks
and
weeks
but
last
of
love
sweet
souvenirs
was
delia
with
her
sighs
and
tears
of
her
it
seemed
i
always
dreamed
and
so
i
loved
her
years
and
years
but
now
again
with
phebe
met
i
love
the
first
one
of
the
set
fickle
you
say
i
answer
nay
my
heart
is
true
to
one
quartette
a
poet
lesson
poet
my
master
come
tell
me
true
and
how
are
your
verses
made
ah
that
is
the
easiest
thing
to
do
you
take
a
cloud
of
a
silvern
hue
a
tender
smile
or
a
sprig
of
rue
with
plenty
of
light
and
shade
and
weave
them
round
in
syllables
rare
with
a
grace
and
skill
divine
with
the
earnest
words
of
a
pleading
prayer
with
a
cadence
caught
from
a
dulcet
air
a
tale
of
love
and
a
lock
of
hair
or
a
bit
of
a
trailing
vine
or
delving
deep
in
a
mine
unwrought
you
find
in
the
teeming
earth
the
golden
vein
of
a
noble
thought
the
soul
of
a
statesman
still
unbought
or
a
patriot
cry
with
anguish
fraught
for
the
land
that
gave
him
birth
a
brilliant
youth
who
has
lost
his
way
on
the
winding
road
of
life
a
sculptor
dream
of
the
plastic
clay
a
painter
soul
in
a
sunset
ray
the
sweetest
thing
a
woman
can
say
or
a
struggling
nation
strife
a
boy
ambition
a
maiden
star
unrisen
but
yet
to
be
a
glimmering
light
that
shines
afar
for
a
sinking
ship
on
a
moaning
bar
an
empty
sleeve
a
veteran
scar
or
a
land
where
men
are
free
and
if
the
poet
hand
be
strong
to
weave
the
web
of
a
deathless
song
and
if
a
master
guide
the
pen
to
words
that
reach
the
hearts
of
men
and
if
the
ear
and
the
touch
be
true
it
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
to
do
place
aux
dames
to
with
brilliant
friends
surrounding
me
so
cosy
at
the
club
i
sitting
while
you
at
home
i
seem
to
see
attending
strictly
to
your
knitting
when
women
have
their
rights
my
dear
we
hear
no
more
of
wrongs
so
shocking
you
with
your
friends
shall
gather
here
i
stay
at
home
and
darn
the
stocking
all
on
a
golden
summer
day
all
on
a
golden
summer
day
as
through
the
leaves
a
single
ray
of
yellow
sunshine
finds
its
way
so
bright
so
bright
the
wakened
birds
that
blithely
sing
seem
welcoming
another
spring
while
all
the
woods
are
murmuring
so
light
so
light
all
on
a
golden
summer
day
when
to
my
heart
a
single
ray
of
tender
kindness
finds
its
way
so
bright
so
bright
then
comes
sweet
hope
and
bravely
dares
to
break
the
chain
that
sorrow
wears
and
all
my
burdens
all
my
cares
are
light
so
light
prismatic
boston
fair

by
the

thrift
proud
in
your
hundred
banks
land
of
the

the
abstruse

the

and
the
shrinking
cook
where
maidens
careless
of
their

johnsonian
oft
express
their
views
where
realistic
pens
invite
the

to
mention

to

on
the

where
strange
sartorial
questions
as
to

offend
our
sisters
cousins
and
our

where
men
expect
by
simple
faith
and
prayer
to
lift
a

to

fair

i
dedicate
my
song
and
tell
how
simple
artless
minds
go
wrong
a
common
councilman
with
lordly
air
one
day
went
strolling
down
through
copley
square
within
his
breast
there
beat
a
spotless
heart
his
taste
was
pure
his
soul
was
steeped
in
art
for
he
had
worshiped
oft
at
cass
shrine
had
daily
knelt
at
cogswell
fount
divine
and
chaste
surroundings
of
the
city
hall
had
taught
him
much
and
so
he
knew
it
all
proud
in
a
sack
coat
and
a
high
silk
hat
content
in
knowing
just
where
he
was
at
he
wandered
on
till
gazing
toward
the
skies
a
nameless
horror
met
his
modest
eyes
for
where
the
artist
chisel
had
engrossed
an
emblem
fit
on
boston
proudest
boast
there
stood
aloft
with
graceful
equipoise
two
very
small
unexpurgated
boys
filled
with
solicitude
for
city
youth
whose
morals
suffer
when
they
told
the
truth
whose
ethic
standards
high
and
higher
rise
when
taught
that
god
and
nature
are
but
lies
in
haste
he
to
the
council
chamber
hied
his
startled
called
aside
his
fearful
secret
whispering
disclosed
till
all
their
separate
joints
were
ankylosed
appalling
was
the
silence
at
his
tale
democrats
turned
red
republicans
turned
pale
what
mugwumps
turned
is
difficult
to
think
but
probably
they
compromised
on
pink
when
these
stern
moralists
had
their
breaths
regained
and
told
how
deeply
they
were
shocked
and
pained
they
then
resolved
how
wrong
our
children
are
said
boys
should
be
contented
with
a
scar
rebuked
dame
nature
for
her
deadly
sins
and
damned
trustees
who
foster
heavenly
twins
o
councilmen
if
it
were
left
for
you
to
say
what
art
is
false
and
what
is
true
what
strange
anomalies
would
the
world
behold
dolls
would
be
angels
dross
would
count
for
gold
vice
would
be
virtue
virtues
would
be
taints
gods
would
be
devils
councilmen
be
saints
and
this
sage
law
by
your
wise
minds
be
built
no
boy
shall
live
if
born
without
a
kilt
then
you
resolve
to
soothe
all
moral
aches
we
always
right
but
god
has
made
mistakes
the
book
hunter
i
spent
all
my
money
in
chasing
for
books
that
are
costly
and
rare
i
made
myself
bankrupt
in
tracing
each
prize
to
its
ultimate
lair
and
now
i
a
ruined
collector
impoverished
ragged
and
thin
reduced
to
a
vanishing
spectre
because
of
my
prodigal
sin
how
often
i
called
upon
foley
the
man
who
a
friend
of
the
cranks
knows
books
that
are
witty
or
holy
and
whether
they
prizes
or
blanks
for
volumes
on
paper
or
vellum
he
has
a
most
accurate
eye
and
always
is
willing
to
sell
to
dreamers
like
me
who
will
buy
my
purse
requires
fences
and
hedges
alas
it
will
never
stay
shut
my
now
have
deckle
edges
my
hair
is
unkempt
and
uncut
my
coat
is
a
true
first
edition
and
rusty
from
shoulder
to
waist
my
trousers
are
out
of
condition
their
colophon
worn
and
defaced
my
shoes
have
been
long
out
of
fashion
crushed
leather
they
both
seem
to
be
my
hat
is
a
thing
for
compassion
the
kind
that
is
labelled
my
vest
from
its
binding
is
broken
it
what
the
french
call
a
what
i
think
of
it
can
not
be
spoken
its
catalogue
mark
is
unique
i
a
book
that
is
thumbed
and
untidy
the
only
one
left
of
the
set
i
sure
i
was
issued
on
friday
for
fate
is
unkind
to
me
yet
my
text
has
been
cruelly
garbled
by
a
destiny
harder
than
flint
but
i
wait
for
my
grave
to
be
marbled
and
then
i
shall
be
out
of
print
the
three
voices
there
once
was
a
man
who
asked
for
pie
in
a
piping
voice
up
high
up
high
and
when
he
asked
for
a
salmon
roe
he
spoke
in
a
voice
down
low
down
low
but
when
he
said
he
had
no
choice
he
always
spoke
in
a
medium
voice
i
can
not
tell
the
reason
why
he
sometimes
spoke
up
high
up
high
and
why
he
sometimes
spoke
down
low
i
do
not
know
i
do
not
know
and
why
he
spoke
in
the
medium
way
do
ask
me
for
i
can
not
say
easy
knowledge
how
nice
be
if
knowledge
grew
on
bushes
as
the
berries
do
then
we
could
plant
our
spelling
seed
and
gather
all
the
words
we
need
the
sums
from
off
our
slates
we
wipe
and
wait
for
figures
to
be
ripe
and
go
into
the
fields
and
pick
whole
bushels
of
arithmetic
or
if
we
wished
to
learn
chinese
we
just
go
out
and
shake
the
trees
and
grammar
then
in
all
the
towns
would
grow
with
proper
verbs
and
nouns
and
in
the
gardens
there
would
be
great
bunches
of
geography
and
all
the
would
stop
and
marvel
at
the
knowledge
crop
and
i
my
pen
would
cease
to
push
and
pluck
my
verses
from
a
bush
susan
scuppernong
silly
susan
scuppernong
cried
so
hard
and
cried
so
long
people
asked
her
what
was
wrong
she
replied
i
do
not
know
any
reason
for
my
woe
i
just
feel
like
feeling
so
the
hatband
my
hatband
goes
around
my
hat
and
while
there
nothing
strange
in
that
it
seems
just
like
a
lazy
man
who
leaves
off
where
he
first
began
but
then
this
fact
is
always
true
the
band
does
what
it
ought
to
do
and
is
more
useful
than
the
man
because
it
does
the
best
it
can
the
oyster
two
halves
of
an
oyster
shell
each
a
shallow
cup
here
once
lived
an
oyster
before
they
ate
him
up
oyster
shells
are
smooth
inside
outside
very
rough
very
little
room
to
spare
but
he
had
enough
bedroom
parlor
kitchen
or
cellar
there
was
none
just
one
room
in
all
the
house
oysters
need
but
one
and
he
was
never
troubled
by
wind
or
rain
or
snow
for
he
had
a
roof
above
another
one
below
i
wonder
if
they
fried
him
or
cooked
him
in
a
stew
and
sold
him
at
a
fair
and
passed
him
off
for
two
i
wonder
if
the
oysters
all
have
names
like
us
and
did
he
have
a
name
like
john
or
romulus
i
wonder
if
his
parents
wept
to
see
him
go
i
wonder
who
can
tell
perhaps
the
mermaids
know
i
wonder
if
our
sleep
the
most
of
us
would
dread
if
we
slept
like
oysters
a
million
in
a
bed
wind
and
rain
the
rain
came
down
on
boston
town
and
the
people
said
oh
dear
it
early
yet
for
our
annual
wet
was
dry
this
time
last
year
in
heavy
suits
and
rubber
boots
they
went
to
the
weather
man
and
said
dear
friend
do
you
intend
to
change
your
present
plan
in
tones
of
scorn
he
said
begone
i
ordered
a
week
of
rain
away
disperse
or
i
do
worse
and
order
a
hurricane
they
sneered
oh
oh
and
they
laughed
ho
ho
and
they
said
you
surely
jest
your
threats
are
vain
for
a
hurricane
is
the
thing
that
we
like
best
our
throats
are
tinned
and
a
sharp
east
wind
we
really
could
do
without
but
we
complain
of
too
much
rain
and
we
think
we
like
a
drought
so
the
weather
man
took
a
fan
and
he
waved
it
up
on
high
and
he
swept
away
the
clouds
so
gray
and
the
sun
shone
out
in
the
sky
and
the
sun
shines
down
on
boston
town
and
the
weather
still
is
clear
and
they
set
their
clocks
by
the
equinox
and
never
the
east
wind
fear
the
flag
here
comes
the
flag
hail
it
who
dares
to
drag
or
trail
it
give
it
hurrahs
three
for
the
stars
three
for
the
bars
uncover
your
head
to
it
the
soldiers
who
tread
to
it
shout
at
the
sight
of
it
the
justice
and
right
of
it
the
unsullied
white
of
it
the
blue
and
red
of
it
and
tyranny
dread
of
it
here
comes
the
flag
cheer
it
valley
and
crag
shall
hear
it
fathers
shall
bless
it
children
caress
it
all
shall
maintain
it
no
one
shall
stain
it
cheers
for
the
sailors
that
fought
on
the
wave
for
it
cheers
for
the
soldiers
that
always
were
brave
for
it
tears
for
the
men
that
went
down
to
the
grave
for
it
here
comes
the
flag
my
masterpiece
i
wrote
the
truest
song
the
world
had
ever
heard
and
clear
melodious
and
strong
and
sweet
was
every
word
the
flowing
numbers
came
to
me
unbidden
from
the
heart
so
pure
the
strain
that
poesy
seemed
something
more
than
art
no
doubtful
cadence
marred
a
line
so
tunefully
it
flowed
and
through
the
measure
all
divine
the
fire
of
genius
glowed
so
deftly
were
the
verses
wrought
so
fair
the
legend
told
that
every
word
revealed
a
thought
and
every
thought
was
gold
mine
was
the
charm
the
power
the
skill
the
wisdom
of
the
years
was
mine
to
move
the
world
at
will
to
laughter
or
to
tears
for
subtile
pleasantry
was
there
and
brilliant
flash
of
wit
now
pleading
eyes
were
raised
in
prayer
and
now
with
smiles
were
lit
i
sang
of
hours
when
youth
was
king
and
of
one
happy
spot
where
life
and
love
were
everything
and
time
was
half
forgot
of
gracious
days
in
woodland
ways
when
every
flower
and
tree
seemed
echoing
the
sweetest
phrase
from
lips
in
arcadie
of
sagas
old
and
norseman
bands
that
sailed
northern
seas
enchanting
tales
of
fairy
lands
and
strange
philosophies
i
sang
of
egypt
fairest
queen
with
passion
fatal
curse
of
that
pale
florentine
as
deathless
as
his
verse
of
time
of
the
arcadian
pan
when
dryads
thronged
the
trees
when
atalanta
swiftly
ran
with
fleet
hippomenes
brave
stories
too
did
i
relate
of
unfurled
of
glorious
days
when
greece
was
great
when
rome
was
all
the
world
of
noble
deeds
for
noble
creeds
of
woman
sacrifice
the
mother
stricken
heart
that
bleeds
for
souls
in
paradise
anon
i
told
a
tale
of
shame
and
while
in
tears
i
slept
behold
a
angel
came
and
read
the
words
and
wept
and
so
i
wrote
my
perfect
song
in
such
a
wondrous
key
i
heard
the
plaudits
of
the
throng
and
fame
awaited
me
alas
the
sullen
morning
broke
and
came
the
tempest
roar
discord
trembling
i
awoke
and
lo
my
dream
was
yet
often
in
the
quiet
night
my
song
returns
to
me
i
seize
the
pen
and
fain
would
write
my
long
lost
melody
but
dreaming
the
words
ere
long
comes
vague
remembering
and
fades
away
the
sweetest
song
that
man
can
ever
sing
a
ballade
of
montaigne
i
sit
before
the
firelight
glow
with
all
the
world
in
apogee
and
con
good
master
florio
with
pipe
and
as
i
see
queen
bess
herself
with
book
reading
it
and
again
here
my
cosy
i
smoke
my
pipe
and
read
montaigne
now
howls
the
wind
and
drives
the
snow
the
traveler
shivers
on
the
lea
while
with
my
precious
folio
behold
a
happy
devotee
to
book
and
warmth
and
reverie
the
blast
upon
the
disturbs
me
not
as
i
smoke
my
pipe
and
read
montaigne
i
am
content
and
thus
i
know
a
mind
as
calm
as
summer
sea
a
heart
that
stranger
is
to
woe
to
happiness
i
hold
the
key
in
this
rare
sweet
philosophy
and
while
the
fates
so
fair
ordain
well
pleased
with
destiny
decree
i
smoke
my
pipe
and
read
montaigne
envoy
dear
prince
aye
more
than
prince
to
me
thou
monarch
of
immortal
reign
always
thy
subject
i
would
be
and
smoke
my
pipe

the
criminal
crime
flourishes
throughout
the
land
and
bids
defiance
to
the
law
and
wicked
deeds
on
every
hand
our
souls
with
awe
i
know
one
hardened
criminal
whose
maidenhood
with
crime
begins
who
safe
behind
a
prison
wall
should
expiate
her
sins
she
is
a
thief
she
smiles
for
then
she
steals
my
heart
from
me
and
keeps
it
with
a
maiden
wiles
and
never
sets
it
free
she
plunders
sighs
from
humankind
she
pilfers
tears
i
would
not
weep
she
robs
me
of
my
peace
of
mind
and
she
purloins
my
sleep
of
lawless
ways
she
stands
confessed
and
is
a
burglar
bold
she
finds
a
weakness
in
my
breast
and
slyly
enters
there
a
gambler
she
whose
arts
entrance
whose
victims
yield
without
demur
content
to
play
love
game
of
chance
and
lose
their
hearts
to
her
a
graver
crime
is
hers
for
when
her
matchless
beauty
i
admire
of
arson
she
is
guilty
then
and
sets
my
heart
on
fire
a
bandit
preying
on
mankind
her
captives
by
the
score
increase
no
hand
can
their
chains
unbind
no
ransom
bring
release
she
is
a
cruel
murderess
her
eyes
send
forth
a
dart
and
as
she
holds
me
in
duress
it
stabs
me
to
the
heart
crime
flourishes
throughout
the
land
and
bids
defiance
to
the
law
and
wicked
deeds
on
every
hand
our
souls
with
awe
a
bit
of
color
paris
oh
damsel
fair
at
the
porte
maillot
with
the
soft
blue
eyes
that
haunt
me
so
pray
what
should
i
do
when
a
girl
like
you
bestows
her
smile
her
glance
and
her
sigh
on
the
first
fond
fool
that
is
passing
by
who
listens
and
longs
as
the
sweet
words
flow
from
her
pretty
red
lips
at
the
porte
maillot
there
were
lips
as
red
ere
you
were
born
now
wreathed
in
smiles
now
curled
in
scorn
and
other
bright
eyes
with
their
truth
and
lies
that
broke
the
heart
and
turned
the
brain
of
many
a
tender
lovelorn
swain
but
never
i
ween
brought
half
the
woe
that
comes
from
the
lips
at
the
porte
maillot
a
charming
picture
there
you
stand
a
perfect
work
from
a
master
hand
with
your
face
so
fair
and
your
wondrous
hair
your
glorious
color
your
light
and
shade
and
your
classic
head
that
the
gods
have
made
your
cheeks
with
crimson
all
aglow
as
you
wait
for
a
lover
at
the
porte
maillot
there
are
gorgeous
tints
in
the
jeweled
crown
there
are
brilliant
shades
when
the
sun
goes
down
but
your
lips
vie
with
the
western
sky
and
give
to
the
world
so
rare
a
hue
that
the
painter
must
learn
his
art
anew
and
the
sunset
borrow
a
brighter
glow
from
the
lips
of
the
girl
at
the
porte
maillot
come
tell
me
truly
youth
do
her
eyes
flash
love
her
lips
speak
truth
or
does
she
beguile
with
her
glance
and
smile
and
burn
you
spurn
you
all
day
long
with
a
circe
art
and
a
siren
song
ah
would
that
your
foolish
heart
might
know
the
lie
in
the
heart
at
the
porte
maillot
dinner
favors
to
i
fill
my
goblet
to
the
brim
and
clink
the
glasses
rim
to
rim
across
the
board
i
waft
a
kiss
with
thanks
for
such
an
hour
as
this
and
clasping
joy
bid
sorrow
flee
and
welcome
you
my
to
of
all
the
joys
on
earth
that
be
there
is
no
sweeter
one
to
me
than
sitting
with
a
merry
lass
from
consommé
to
and
yet
a
golden
hour
i
steal
reverse
the
order
of
the
meal
and
countermarching
backward
stray
from
to
consommé
to
give
me
but
a
bit
to
eat
and
an
hour
or
two
just
a
salad
and
a
sweet
and
a
chat
with
you
give
me
table
full
or
bare
crust
or
rich
ragout
but
whatever
be
the
fare
always
give
me
you
the
host
between
the
two
perplexed
i
go
a
shuttlecock
tossed
to
and
fro
i
gaze
on
one
and
know
that
she
is
all
that
womankind
can
be
i
seek
the
other
and
she
seems
the
perfect
idol
of
my
dreams
and
so
between
the
charming
pair
my
heart
is
ever
in
the
air
and
yet
although
it
be
my
fate
to
hover
indeterminate
i
rest
content
nor
ask
for
more
than
this
sweet
game
of
battledore
the
moper
the
moper
mopeth
all
the
day
he
mopeth
eke
at
night
and
never
is
the
moper
gay
but
grim
and
serious
alway
he
is
a
sorry
sight
he
liketh
not
the
merry
quip
he
hateth
other
men
escheweth
he
companionship
nor
doth
he
essay
to
trip
the
light
fantastic
ten
he
seeketh
not
where
brooks
with
rippling
music
flow
he
seeth
naught
in
woman
looks
and
never
readeth
he
in
books
except
they
tell
of
woe
he
forgetteth
that
the
sun
likewise
god
balmy
air
were
made
to
gladden
every
one
but
he
preferreth
both
to
shun
and
taketh
not
his
share
he
careth
not
for
merry
wights
who
drink
château
yquem
but
he
would
set
the
world
to
rights
by
peopling
it
with
eremites
and
very
few
of
them
when
children
sport
with
merry
glee
he
thinketh
they
are
wild
and
with
them
doth
so
disagree
it
seemeth
verily
that
he
hath
never
been
a
child
he
thinketh
that
it
is
not
right
rare
dishes
to
discuss
and
knoweth
not
the
keen
delight
of
one
that
hath
an
appetite
yclepèd
ravenous
of
goodly
raiment
he
hath
none
he
calleth
it
display
wherefore
the
urchin
poketh
fun
because
he
looketh
like
that
one
unholy
men
call
jay
and
so
we
see
this
foolish
man
all
pleasant
things
doth
scorn
good
folk
pray
god
to
change
his
plan
and
cheer
the
moper
if
he
can

afraid

fair
and
neither
youth
nor
maid
was
in

least
afraid
and
hand
in
hand
they
ramble
here
and
there
here
and
there
uncle
jogalong
my
dear
old
uncle
jogalong
was
very
slow
was
very
slow
and
said
he
thought
that
folks
were
wrong
to
hurry
so
to
hurry
so
when
he
walked
out
upon
the
street
to
take
the
air
to
take
the
air
it
seemed
almost
as
if
his
feet
were
fastened
there
were
fastened
there
he
thought
that
traveling
by
rail
was
hurrying
and
scurrying
but
said
the
slow
and
creeping
snail
was
just
the
thing
was
just
the
thing
he
thought
a
hasty
appetite
an
awful
crime
an
awful
crime
so
never
finished
breakfast
quite
till
dinner
time
till
dinner
time
he
said
the
world
turned
round
so
fast
he
could
not
stay
he
could
not
stay
and
so
he
said
at
last
and
went
away
and
went
away
the
indifferent
mariner
i
a
tough
old
salt
and
it
never
i
care
a
penny
which
way
the
wind
is
or
whether
i
sight
cape
finisterre
or
make
a
port
at
the
indies
some
folks
steer
for
a
port
to
trade
and
some
steer
north
for
the
whaling
yet
never
i
care
a
damn
just
where
i
sail
so
long
i
sailing
you
never
can
stop
the
wind
when
it
blows
and
you
ca
stop
the
rain
from
raining
then
why
oh
why
go
of
your
eye
when
there
no
sort
o
use
in
complaining
my
face
is
browned
and
my
lungs
are
sound
and
my
hands
they
are
big
and
calloused
i
a
little
brown
jug
i
sometimes
hug
and
a
little
bread
and
meat
for
ballast
but
i
keep
no
log
of
my
daily
grog
for
what
the
use
o
being
bothered
i
drink
a
little
more
when
the
wind
offshore
and
most
when
the
wind
from
the
of
course
with
a
chill
if
i
took
quite
ill
and
my
legs
get
weak
and
toddly
at
the
jug
i
pull
and
turn
in
full
and
sleep
the
sleep
of
the
godly
but
whether
i
do
or
whether
i
do
or
whether
the
jug
my
failing
it
never
i
care
a
damn
just
where
i
sail
so
long
i
sailing
on
a
library
wall
when
faltering
fingers
bid
me
cease
to
write
and
laying
down
the
pen
i
seek
the
night
may
those
to
whom
the
daylight
still
is
sweet
with
loving
lips
my
name
ofttimes
repeat
and
should
belshazzar
spirit
hither
stray
and
linger
the
lines
i
write
may
he
who
wept
for
babylonia
fall
look
kindly
at
writing
on
the
wall
mulligatawny
mulligatawny
said
i
sure
it
going
to
rain
mulligatawny
said
to
me
it
very
plain
william
mulligatawny
said
it
must
rain
anyhow
mary
mulligatawny
said
i
feel
it
raining
now
and
yet
there
were
no
clouds
in
sight
and
was
a
pleasant
day
but
mulligatawny
always
liked
to
have
her
way
with
mulligatawny
the
family
all
agreed
for
all
the
mulligatawnys
feared
her
very
much
indeed
and
did
whenever
they
were
bid
as
mulligatawny
did
and
tried
to
think
as
they
were
taught
as
mulligatawny
thought
mulligatawny
said
now
two
and
two
are
three
mulligatawny
said
i
sure
they
ought
to
be
william
mulligatawny
said
arithmetic
is
wrong
mary
mulligatawny
said
it
been
so
all
along
now
two
and
two
do
not
make
three
and
three
they
never
were
but
mulligatawny
said
was
near
enough
for
her
with
mulligatawny
the
family
all
agreed
for
all
the
mulligatawnys
feared
her
very
much
indeed
and
did
whenever
they
were
bid
as
mulligatawny
did
and
tried
to
think
as
they
were
taught
as
mulligatawny
thought
mulligatawny
fell
out
of
the
world
one
day
mulligatawny
said
i
do
know
what
to
say
william
mulligatawny
said
i
do
know
what
to
do
mary
mulligatawny
said
i
feel
the
same
as
you
mulligatawny
left
the
family
sitting
there
they
could
think
they
could
move
because
they
did
dare
for
mulligatawny
had
always
thought
for
them
and
all
the
mulligatawnys
thought
the
same
as
and
did
whenever
they
were
bid
as
mulligatawny
did
and
tried
to
think
as
they
were
taught
as
mulligatawny
thought
euthanasia
to
oh
drop
your
eyelids
down
my
lady
oh
drop
your
eyelids
down
well
to
keep
your
bright
eyes
shady
for
pity
of
the
town
but
should
there
any
glances
be
i
pray
you
give
them
all
to
me
for
though
my
life
be
lost
thereby
it
were
the
sweetest
death
to
die
dainty
little
love
dainty
little
love
came
tripping
down
the
hill
smiling
as
he
thought
of
sipping
sweets
at
will
she
said
no
love
must
go
dainty
little
love
came
tripping
down
the
hill
dainty
little
love
went
sighing
up
the
hill
all
his
little
hopes
were
dying
love
was
ill
vain
he
tried
tears
to
hide
dainty
little
love
went
sighing
up
the
hill
to
sweet
visions
came
to
me
in
sleep
ah
wondrous
fair
to
see
and
in
my
mind
i
strove
to
keep
the
dream
to
tell
to
thee
but
morning
broke
with
golden
gleam
and
shone
upon
thy
face
and
life
was
lovelier
than
a
dream
and
dreams
had
lost
their
grace
the
song
i
heard
an
old
familiar
air
strummed
idly
by
a
careless
hand
yet
in
the
melody
were
rare
sweet
echoings
from
childhood
land
the
mother
touch
the
wise
denials
and
consents
the
trivial
sorrows
that
were
much
small
pleasures
that
were
large
events
the
fancies
dreams
strange
wonderings
the
daily
problems
unexplained
momentous
as
the
cares
of
kings
that
on
unhappy
thrones
have
reigned
came
back
with
each
unstudied
tone
and
came
that
song
remembered
best
which
with
a
sweetness
all
its
own
once
lulled
the
child
to
rest
and
there
secure
as
tarik
height
he
slumbered
shielded
from
alarms
safe
from
the
mystery
of
night
close
folded
in
the
mother
arms
then
israel
mighty
songs
of
old
and
all
the
modern
masters
art
were
less
than
simple
lays
that
told
the
secret
of
the
mother
heart
the
sweetest
melody
that
flows
from
lips
that
win
the
world
applause
charms
not
like
that
which
childhood
knows
unfettered
by
the
curb
of
laws
for
though
we
rise
to
nobler
themes
to
grander
harmonies
attain
their
lives
not
in
the
academes
the
magic
of
the
simpler
strain
and
we
may
spurn
the
cruder
song
or
name
it
anything
we
will
denounce
the
artifice
as
wrong
yet
to
the
child
is
music
still
thus
to
an
idle
air

the

calling
vain
doth
it
wait
for
one
dear
mate
that
shall
know
the
morrow
then
sinks
to

with
drooping
crest
in
one
long
dream
of

where
the
feathery
goes
and
it
tells
the
bird
in

keep
the

i

they
never

what
is
that
my
daughter
dear
upon
thy
cheek
so
fair
is
but
a
kiss
my
mother
dear
kind
fortune
sent
it
there
it
was
a
courteous
that
gave
it
unto
me
and
it
is
passing
red
because
it
was
the
last
of
three
a
kiss
indeed
my
daughter
dear
i
marvel
in
surprise
such
conduct
with
a
i
fear
me
was
not
wise
methought
the
same
my
mother
dear
and
so
at
three
forbore
although
the
courteous
vowed
he
had
many
more
now
prithee
daughter
quickly
go
and
bring
the
stranger
here
and
bid
him
hie
and
bid
him
fly
to
me
my
daughter
dear
for
times
be
very
very
hard
and
blessings
eke
so
rare
i
fain
would
meet
a
that
hath
a
kiss
to
spare
the
honeysuckle
vine
was
a
tender
little
honeysuckle
vine
that
smiled
and
danced
in
the
warm
sunshine
and
spied
a
maid
as
fair
as
all
maids
be
who
said
little
honeysuckle
come
up
to
me
so
it
climbed
and
climbed
in
the
sun
and
the
shade
and
all
summer
long
at
her
window
stayed
for
that
is
the
way
that
honeysuckles
go
and
that
is
the
way
that
true
loves
grow
then
the
loving
little
honeysuckle
vine
kissed
the
little
maid
in
the
warm
sunshine
but
the
winter
came
with
an
angry
frown
and
the
false
little
maid
shut
the
window
down
and
the
sorrowing
vine
on
the
wintry
side
mourned
and
mourned
for
the
love
that
died
and
faded
away
in
the
wind
and
snow
and
that
is
the
way
that
some
loves

saint

olden
time
in
the
days
when
the
saints
were
in
their
prime
oh
his
feet
were
bare
and
bruised
and
cold
but
his
heart
was
warm
and
as
pure
as
gold
and
the
kind
old
saint
with
his
gown
and
his
hood
was
loved
by
the
sinners
and
loved
by
the
good
for
he
made
the
sinners
as
pure
as
the
snow
and
the
good
men
needed
him
to
keep
them
so

a

and
a
song
and
a
rhyme
to
the
barefooted
saint
of
the
olden
time
he
loved
a
friend
and
a
flagon
of
wine
when
the
friend
was
true
and
the
bottle
was
fine
he
would
raise
his
glass
with
a
knowing
wink
and
this
was
the
toast
he
would
always
drink
oh
here
to
the
good
and
the
bad
men
too
for
without
them
saints
would
have
nothing
to
do
oh
i
love
them
both
and
i
love
them
well
but
which
i
love
better
i
never
can
tell

as
he
journeyed
along
on
the
king
highway
he
gave
all
the
boys
and
the
girls
and
never
a
child
saw
the
hood
and
gown
but
ran
to
the
father
of

town
he
a
word
for
the
wicked
and
he
called
them
kin
and
he
said
i
am
certain
that
there
must
be
sin
while
a
few
get
the
loaves
and
many
get
the
crumbs
and
some

but
the
saint
grew
old
and
sorry
the
day
when
his
life
went
out
with
the
tide
in
the
bay
but
he
left
a
name
and
he
left
a
creed
of
the
cheerful
life
and
the
kindly
deed
then
remember
the
man
of
the
days
of
old
whose
heart
was
warm
and
as
pure
as
gold

the
gurgling
imps
the
gurgling
imps
of
mummery
mum
lived
in
the
land
of
the
crimson
plum
and
a
language
very
strange
had
they
was
merely
a
chattering
ricochet
the
gurgling
imps
of
mummery
mum
caught
hummingbirds
for
the
sake
of
the
hum
their
cheeks
were
flushed
with
a
sable
tinge
their
eyelids
hung
on
a
silver
hinge
the
gurgling
imps
of
mummery
mum
called
each
other
my
charming
chum
and
floated
in
tears
of
joy
to
see
their
relatives
hung
in
a
cranberry
tree
the
gurgling
imps
of
mummery
mum
stole
the
whole
of
a
half
of
a
crumb
and
a
wind
arose
and
blew
the
imps
way
off
to
the
land
of
the
lazy
limps
the
worm
will
turn
i
a
gentle
meek
and
patient
human
worm
unattractive
rather
active
with
a
sense
of
right
original
but
firm
i
was
taught
to
be
forgiving
for
my
enemies
to
pray
but
what
the
use
of
living
if
you
never
can
repay
all
the
little
animosities
that
in
your
bosom
burn
oh
it
pleasant
to
remember
that
the
worm
will
turn
i
so
gentle
and
so
patient
and
so
meek
unpretending
unoffending
but
if
perchance
you
smite
me
on
the
cheek
i
will
never
turn
the
other
as
i
was
taught
to
do
by
a
puritanic
mother
whose
theology
was
blue
your
experience
will
widen
when
explicitly
you
learn
how
a
modest
mild
submissive
little
worm
will
turn
i
so
subtle
and
so
crafty
and
so
sly
i
am
humble
but
i
tumble
to
the
slightest
oscillation
of
the
eye
when
others
think
they
winning
a
fabulous
amount
then
i
do
a
little
sinning
on
my
personal
account
and
in
my
quiet
simple
way
a
modest
stipend
earn
as
they
slowly
grasp
the
bitter
fact
that
worms
will
turn
oh
human
worms
are
curious
little
things
inoffensive
rather
pensive
till
it
comes
to
using
little
human
stings
oh
then
avoid
intrusion
if
you
would
be
discreet
and
cultivate
seclusion
in
an
underground
retreat
and
whenever
you
are
tempted
the
lowly
worm
to
spurn
just
bear
in
mind
that
little
line
the
worm
will
turn
the
boston
cats
a
little
cat
played
on
a
silver
flute
and
a
big
cat
sat
and
listened
the
little
cat
strains
gave
the
big
cat
pains
and
a
tear
on
his
eyelid
glistened
then
the
big
cat
said
oh
rest
awhile
but
the
little
cat
said
no
no
for
i
get
pay
for
the
tunes
i
play
and
the
big
cat
answered
oh
if
you
get
pay
for
the
tunes
you
play
i
afraid
you
play
till
you
drop
you
spoil
your
health
in
the
race
for
wealth
so
i
give
you
more
to
stop
said
the
little
cat
hush
you
make
me
blush
your
offer
is
unusually
kind
though
it
very
very
hard
to
leave
the
back
yard
i
accept
if
you
do
mind
so
the
big
cat
gave
him
a
thousand
pounds
and
a
silver
brush
and
a
comb
and
a
country
seat
on
beacon
street
right
under
the
state
house
dome
and
the
little
cat
sits
with
other
little
kits
and
watches
the
bright
sun
rise
and
the
voice
of
the
flute
is
long
since
mute
and
the
big
cat
dries
his
eyes
the
jonquil
maid
a
little
maid
sat
in
a
jonquil
tree
singing
alone
in
a
low
and
the
wind
swept
by
with
a
wistful
moan
for
he
longed
to
stay
with
the
maid
all
day
but
he
knew
as
he
blew
it
was
true
that
the
dew
would
never
never
dry
if
the
wind
should
die
so
he
hurried
away
where
the
rosebuds
grew
and
while
to
the
land
of
the
rose
went
he
singing
alone
in
a
low
a
little
maid
sat
in
a
jonquil
tree
the
little
maid
eyes
had
a
rainbow
hue
and
her
sunset
hair
was
woven
with
care
in
a
knot
that
was
fit
for
a
psyche
to
wear
and
she
pressed
her
lips
with
her
finger
tips
threw
a
sly
kiss
to
try
if
he
sigh
in
reply
and
said
with
a
laugh
oh
it
not
one
half
as
sweet
as
i
give
when
there
some
one
nigh
and
while
to
the
rosebud
land
went
he
singing
alone
in
a
low
a
little
maid
sat
in
a
jonquil
tree
the
wind
swept
back
to
the
jonquil
tree
at
the
close
of
day
in
the
twilight
gray
but
the
sweet
little
maid
had
stolen
away
and
whither
she
flown
will
never
be
known
till
the
rose
as
it
blows
shall
disclose
all
it
knows
of
the
maid
so
fair
with
the
sunset
hair
and
the
sad
wind
comes
and
sighs
and
goes
and
dreams
of
the
day
when
he
blew
so
free
when
singing
alone
in
a
low
a
little
maid
sat
in
a
jonquil
tree
the
rollicking
mastodon
a
rollicking
mastodon
lived
in
spain
in
the
trunk
of
a
tranquil
tree
his
face
was
plain
but
his
jocular
vein
was
a
burst
of
the
wildest
glee
his
voice
was
strong
and
his
laugh
so
long
that
people
came
many
a
mile
and
offered
to
pay
a
guinea
a
day
for
the
fractional
part
of
a
smile
the
rollicking
mastodon
laugh
was
wide
indeed
was
a
matter
of
family
pride
and
oh
so
proud
of
his
jocular
vein
was
the
rollicking
mastodon
over
in
spain
the
rollicking
mastodon
said
one
day
i
feel
that
i
need
some
air
for
a
little
ozone
a
tonic
for
bones
as
well
as
a
gloss
for
the
hair
so
he
skipped
along
and
warbled
a
song
in
his
own
triumphulant
way
his
smile
was
bright
and
his
skip
was
light
as
he
chirruped
his
roundelay
the
rollicking
mastodon
tripped
along
and
sang
what
mastodons
call
a
song
but
every
note
of
it
seemed
to
pain
the
rollicking
mastodon
over
in
spain
a
little
peetookle
came
over
the
hill
dressed
up
in
a
bollitant
coat
and
he
said
you
need
some
harroway
seed
and
a
little
advice
for
your
throat
the
mastodon
smiled
and
said
my
child
there
a
chance
for
your
taste
to
grow
if
you
polish
your
mind
you
certainly
find
how
little
how
little
you
know
the
little
peetookle
his
teeth
he
ground
at
the
mastodon
singular
sense
of
sound
for
he
felt
it
a
sort
of
musical
stain
on
the
rollicking
mastodon
over
in
spain
alas
and
alas
has
it
come
to
this
pass
said
the
little
peetookle
dear
me
it
certainly
seems
your
horrible
screams
intended
for
music
must
be
the
mastodon
stopped
his
ditty
he
dropped
and
murmured
my
dear
i
never
will
sing
to
a
sensitive
thing
that
shatters
a
song
with
a
sneer
the
rollicking
mastodon
bade
him
adieu
of
course
was
a
sensible
thing
to
do
for
little
peetookle
is
spared
the
strain
of
the
rollicking
mastodon
over
in
spain
the
five
senses
oh
why
do
men
their
glasses
clink
when
good
old
honest
wine
they
drink
wine
is
so
excellent
a
thing
to
lowest
subject
or
to
highest
king
that
every
sense
alike
should
share
the
pleasure
that
can
banish
care
thus
may
each
merry
eye
the
sparkle
of
the
red
or
gold
our
lips
may
the
goblet
edge
and
the
loving
cup
we
pledge
while
from
each
foaming
glass
escape
the
precious
of
the
grape
but
ah
we
it
not
and
so
we
give
the
that
all
men
know
and
thus
do
all
the
senses
share
the
pleasure
that
can
banish
care
and
that
is
why
the
glasses
clink
when
good
old
honest
wine
we
drink
economy
a
valentine
i
send
o
sweetest
friend
a
kiss
such
as
fair
ladies
gave
of
old
when
knights
were
brave
and
smiles
were
won
through
foes
undone
and
this
will
be
for
you
to
give
again
to
me
and
then
its
present
errand
i
give
it
unto
you
once
more
ere
briefest
time
elapse
with
interest
perhaps
its
mission
spent
again
to
me
it
may
be
lent
and
thus
day
after
day
as
we
a
simple
law
obey
forever
to
and
fro
the
selfsame
kiss
will
go
a
busy
shuttle
that
shall
weave
a
web
of
love
to
soften
and
relieve
our
daily
care
and
so
as
thus
we
share
with
lip
to
lip
our
frugal
partnership
one
kiss
will
always
do
for
two
and
oh
how
easy
it
will
be
to
practice
this
economy
idylettes
of
the
queen
she
i
fain
would
write
on
pleasant
themes
so
let
me
prate
awhile
of
kate
and
if
my
rhyming
effort
seems
uncouth
or
rough
at
any
rate
she
kate
and
that
enough
her
eyes
her
eyes
are
bright
i
can
not
say
like
stars
at
night
nor
can
i
say
like
the
orb
of
day
because
such
phrases
are
archaic
and
if
i
swear
that
they
compare
with
diamonds
rare
that
too
prosaic
i
hunted
my
thesaurus
through
the
century
and
webster
too
but
all
in
vain
is
therefore
plain
that
they
who
made
these
books
so
wise
had
never
seen
her
eyes
her
gown
when
kate
puts
on
her
sunday
gown
and
goes
to
church
all
in
her
best
the
watchful
gargoyles
looking
down
relax
their
most
forbidding
frown
and
smile
with
kindly
interest
discerning
gargoyles
could
i
be
one
of
your
number
looking
down
with
you
i
surely
would
agree
and
share
your
amiability
at
sight
of
kate
and
sunday
gown
her
knowledge
how
much
she
knows
no
one
can
tell
but
she
can
read
and
write
and
spell
divide
and
multiply
and
add
and
name
the
apples
thomas
had
when
john
enticed
him
five
to
sell
for
jelly
she
does
not
say
jell
nor
horrify
us
with
umbrell
for
all
of
which
we
very
glad
how
much
she
knows
she
knows
the
oyster
by
his
shell
detects
the
newsboy
by
his
yell
enumerates
the
bones
in
shad
and
thinks
my
poetry
is
bad
well
well
well
well
well
well
well
well
how
much
she
knows
her
sigh
when
she
utters
a
sigh
is
a
breath
from
the
roses
and
nigh
when
she
utters
a
sigh
the
bees
wonder
why
no
garden
discloses
when
she
utters
a
sigh
is
a
breath
from
the
roses
her
ring
her
ring
goes
round
her
finger
oh
foolish
thing
were
i
a
ring
i
not
go
round
i
linger
her
faults
of
faults
she
has
but
one
and
that
is
she
has
none
her
voice
sweet
and
soothing
rhythmic
tuneful
dulcet
mellow
zither
lute
guitar
and
there
you
are
her
love
do
you
love
me
to
we
keep
in
step
as
years
roll
by
you
march
behind
and
i
before
the
path
is
new
to
you
but
i
have
passed
the
ground
you
walking
yet
i
march
on
with
measured
tread
and
looking
back
i
smile
and
greet
you
i
fear
the
order
halt
instead
would
i
might
countermarch
and
meet
you
bon
voyage
to
out
from
the
land
of
the
future
into
the
land
of
the
past
a
comrade
sails
to
the
east
the
sport
of
the
wave
and
the
blast
oh
billow
and
breeze
be
kind
and
temper
your
strength
to
your
guest
kind
for
the
sake
of
the
friend
for
the
sake
of
the
hands
he
pressed
oh
tenderest
billow
and
breeze
welcome
him
even
as
we
would
welcome
if
you
were
the
friend
and
we
were
the
wind
and
the
sea
welcome
protect
him
and
waft
him
westward
and
homeward
at
last
into
the

of
the

from

may
read
if
he

wrongly
look
some
sorry
pages
in
his
book

if
he
