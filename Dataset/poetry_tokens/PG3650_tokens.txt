notes
selections
of
american
poetry
introduction
if
we
define
poetry
as
the
heart
of
man
expressed
in
beautiful
language
we
shall
not
say
that
we
have
no
national
poetry
true
america
has
produced
no
shakespeare
and
no
milton
but
we
have
an
inheritance
in
all
english
literature
and
many
poets
in
america
have
followed
in
the
footsteps
of
their
literary
british
forefathers
puritan
life
was
severe
it
was
warfare
and
manual
labor
of
a
most
exhausting
type
and
loneliness
and
devotion
to
a
strict
sense
of
duty
it
was
a
life
in
which
pleasure
was
given
the
least
place
and
duty
the
greatest
our
puritan
ancestors
thought
music
and
poetry
dangerous
if
not
actually
sinful
because
they
made
men
think
of
this
world
rather
than
of
heaven
when
anne
bradstreet
wrote
our
first
known
american
poems
she
was
expressing
english
thought
the
tenth
muse
was
not
animated
by
the
life
around
her
but
was
living
in
a
dream
of
the
land
she
had
left
behind
her
poems
are
faint
echoes
of
the
poetry
of
england
after
time
had
identified
her
with
life
in
the
new
world
she
wrote
contemplations
in
which
her
english
nightingales
are
changed
to
crickets
and
her
english
to
american
blackberry
vines
the
truly
representative
poetry
of
colonial
times
is
michael
wigglesworth
day
of
doom
this
is
the
real
heart
of
the
puritan
his
conscience
in
imperfect
rhyme
it
fulfills
the
first
part
of
our
definition
but
shows
by
its
lack
of
beautiful
style
that
both
elements
are
necessary
to
produce
real
poetry
philip
freneau
was
the
first
american
who
sought
to
express
his
life
in
poetry
the
test
of
beauty
of
language
again
excludes
from
real
poetry
some
of
his
expressions
and
leaves
us
a
few
beautiful
lyrics
such
as
the
wild
honeysuckle
in
which
the
poet
sings
his
love
of
american
nature
with
them
american
poetry
may
be
said
to
begin
the
fast
historical
event
of
national
importance
was
the
american
revolution
amid
the
bitter
years
of
want
of
suffering
and
of
war
few
men
tried
to
write
anything
beautiful
life
was
harsh
and
stirring
and
this
note
was
echoed
in
all
the
literature
as
a
result
we
have
narrative
and
political
poetry
such
as
the
battle
of
the
kegs
and
a
fable
dealing
almost
entirely
with
events
and
aiming
to
arouse
military
ardor
in
the
ballad
of
nathan
hale
the
musical
expression
of
bravery
pride
and
sympathy
raises
the
poem
so
far
above
the
rhymes
of
their
period
that
it
will
long
endure
as
the
most
memorable
poetic
expression
of
the
revolutionary
period
poetry
was
still
a
thing
of
the
moment
an
avocation
not
dignified
by
receiving
the
best
of
a
man
with
william
cullen
bryant
came
a
change
he
told
our
nation
that
in
the
new
world
as
well
as
in
the
old
some
men
should
live
for
the
beautiful
everything
in
nature
spoke
to
him
in
terms
of
human
life
other
poets
saw
the
relation
between
their
own
lives
and
the
life
of
the
flowers
and
the
birds
but
bryant
constantly
expressed
this
relationship
the
concluding
stanza
of
to
a
waterfowl
is
the
most
perfect
example
of
this
characteristic
but
it
underlies
also
the
whole
thought
of
his
youthful
poem
thanatopsis
a
view
of
death
if
we
could
all
read
the
lives
of
our
gentians
and
bobolinks
as
he
did
there
would
be
more
true
poetry
in
america
modern
thinkers
urge
us
to
step
outside
of
ourselves
into
the
lives
of
others
and
by
our
imagination
to
share
their
emotions
this
is
no
new
ambition
in
america
since
bryant
in
the
crowded
street
analyzes
the
life
in
the
faces
he
sees
until
the
early
part
of
the
nineteenth
century
american
poetry
dealt
mainly
with
the
facts
of
history
and
the
description
of
nature
a
new
element
of
fancy
is
prominent
in
joseph
rodman
drake
the
culprit
fay
it
dances
through
a
long
narrative
with
the
delicacy
of
the
fay
himself
edgar
allan
poe
brought
into
our
poetry
somber
sentiment
and
musical
expression
puritan
poetry
was
somber
but
it
was
almost
devoid
of
sentiment
poe
loved
sad
beauty
and
meditated
on
the
sad
things
in
life
many
of
his
poems
lament
the
loss
of
some
fair
one
to
helen
annabel
lee
lenore
and
to
one
in
paradise
have
the
theme
while
in
the
raven
the
poet
is
seeking
solace
for
the
loss
of
lenore
eulalie
a
song
rises
on
the
other
hand
to
intense
happiness
with
poe
the
sound
by
which
his
idea
was
expressed
was
as
important
as
the
thought
itself
he
knew
how
to
make
the
sound
suit
the
thought
as
in
the
raven
and
the
bells
one
who
understands
no
english
can
grasp
the
meaning
of
the
different
sections
from
the
mere
sound
so
clearly
distinguishable
are
the
clashing
of
the
brass
and
the
tolling
of
the
iron
bells
if
we
return
to
our
definition
of
poetry
as
an
expression
of
the
heart
of
a
man
we
shall
find
the
explanation
of
these
peculiarities
poe
was
a
man
of
moods
and
possessed
the
ability
to
express
these
moods
in
appropriate
sounds
the
contrast
between
the
emotion
of
poe
and
the
calm
spirit
of
the
man
who
followed
him
is
very
great
in
henry
wadsworth
longfellow
american
poetry
reached
mark
lafcadio
hearn
in
his
interpretations
of
literature
says
really
i
believe
that
it
is
a
very
good
test
of
any
englishman
ability
to
feel
poetry
simply
to
ask
him
you
like
longfellow
when
you
were
a
boy
if
he
eats
then
it
is
no
use
to
talk
to
him
on
the
subject
of
poetry
at
all
however
much
he
might
be
able
to
tell
you
about
quantities
and
metres
no
american
has
in
equal
degree
won
the
name
of
household
poet
if
this
term
is
correctly
understood
it
sums
up
his
merits
more
succinctly
than
can
any
other
title
longfellow
dealt
largely
with
men
and
women
and
the
emotions
common
to
us
all
hiawatha
conquering
the
deer
and
bison
and
hunting
in
despair
for
food
where
only
snow
and
ice
abound

her

and
her
lover

done
can
bring
happiness
all
these
and
more
express
the
emotions
which
we
know
are
true
in
our
own
lives
in
his
longer
narrative
poems
he
makes
the
legends
of
puritan
life
real
to
us
he
takes
english
and
makes
us
see
othere
talking
to
arthur
and
the
viking
stealing
his
bride
his
short
poems
are
even
better
known
than
his
longer
narratives
in
them
he
expressed
his
gentle
sincere
love
of
the
young
the
suffering
and
the
sorrowful
in
the
sonnets
he
showed
that
deep
appreciation
of
european
literature
which
made
noteworthy
his
teaching
at
harvard
and
his
translations
he
believed
that
he
was
assigned
a
definite
task
in
the
world
which
he
described
as
follows
in
his
last
poem
as
comes
the
smile
to
the
lips
the
foam
to
the
surge
so
come
to
the
poet
his
songs
all
hitherward
blown
from
the
misty
realm
that
belongs
to
the
vast
unknown
his
and
not
his
are
the
lays
he
sings
and
their
fame
is
his
and
not
his
and
the
praise
and
the
pride
of
a
name
for
voices
pursue
him
by
day
and
haunt
him
by
night
and
he
listens
and
needs
must
obey
when
the
angel
says
john
greenleaf
whittier
seems
to
suffer
by
coming
in
such
close
proximity
to
longfellow
genuine
he
was
but
his
spirit
was
less
buoyant
than
longfellow
and
he
touches
our
hearts
less
most
of
his
early
poems
were
devoted
to
a
current
political
issue
they
aimed
to
win
converts
to
the
cause
of
such
poems
always
suffer
in
time
in
comparison
with
the
song
of
a
man
who
sings
because
the
heart
is
so
full
that
a
drop
overfills
it
whittier
later
poems
belong
more
to
this
class
and
some
of
them
speak
to
our
emotions
as
well
as
to
our
intellects
the
hero
moves
us
with
a
desire
to
serve
mankind
and
the
stirring
tone
of
barbara
frietchie
arouses
our
patriotism
by
its
picture
of
the
same
type
of
bravery
in
similar
vein
is
barclay
of
ury
which
must
have
touched
deeply
the
heart
of
the
quaker
poet
the
pipes
of
lucknow
is
dramatic
in
its
intense
grasp
of
a
climactic
hour
and
loses
none
of
its
force
in
the
expression
we
can
actually
hear
the
skirl
of
the
bagpipes
whittier
knew
the
artiste
of
the
world
and
talked
to
us
about
raphael
and
burns
with
affectionate
interest
his
poems
show
varied
characteristics
the
love
of
the
sterner
aspects
of
nature
modified
by
the
appreciation
of
the
humble
flower
the
conscience
of
the
puritan
tinged
with
sympathy
for
the
sorrowful
the
steadfastness
of
the
quaker
stirred
by
the
fire
of
the
patriot
the
poetry
of
ralph
waldo
emerson
is
marked
by
serious
contemplation
rather
than
by
warmth
of
emotional
expression
in
longfellow
the
appeal
is
constantly
to
a
heart
which
is
not
disassociated
from
a
brain
in
emerson
the
appeal
is
often
to
the
intellect
alone
we
recognize
the
force
of
the
lesson
in
the
titmouse
even
if
it
leaves
us
less
devoted
citizens
than
does
the
hero
and
less
capable
women
than
does
evangeline
he
reaches
his
highest
excellence
when
he
makes
us
feel
as
well
as
understand
a
lesson
as
in
the
concord
hymn
and
forbearance
if
we
could
all
write
on
the
tablets
of
our
hearts
that
single
stanza
forbearance
would
be
a
real
factor
in
life
and
it
is
to
this
poet
whom
we
call
unemotional
that
we
owe
this
inspiring
quatrain
so
nigh
is
grandeur
to
our
dust
so
near
is
god
to
man
when
duty
whispers
low
thou
must

james
russell
lowell
was
animated
by
a
purpose
which
he
described
in
the
following
lines
it
may
be
glorious
to
write
thoughts
that
make
glad
the
two
or
three
high
souls
like
those
far
stars
that
come
in
sight
once
in
a
century
but
better
far
it
is
to
speak
one
simple
word
which
now
and
then
shall
waken
their
free
nature
in
the
weak
and
friendless
sons
of
men
to
write
some
earnest
verse
or
line
which
seeking
not
the
praise
of
art
shall
make
a
clearer
faith
and
manhood
shine
in
the
untutored
heart
his
very
accomplishments
made
it
difficult
for
him
to
reach
this
aim
since
his
poetry
does
not
move
the
untutored
heart
so
readily
as
does
that
of
longfellow
or
whittier
it
is
on
the
whole
too
deeply
burdened
with
learning
and
too
individual
in
expression
to
fulfil
his
highest
desire
of
his
early
poems
the
most
generally
known
is
probably
the
vision
of
sir
launfal
in
which
a
strong
moral
purpose
is
combined
with
lines
of
beautiful
nature
description
and
what
is
so
rare
as
a
day
in
june
then
if
ever
come
perfect
days
two
works
by
which
he
will
be
permanently
remembered
show
a
deeper
and
more
effective
lowell
the
biglow
papers
are
the
most
successful
of
all
the
american
poems
which
attempt
to
improve
conditions
by
means
of
humor
although
they
refer
in
the
main
to
the
situation
at
the
time
of
the
mexican
war
they
deal
with
such
universal
political
traits
that
they
may
be
applied
to
almost
any
age
they
are
written
in
a
yankee
dialect
which
it
is
asserted
was
never
spoken
but
which
enhances
the
humor
as
in
what
robinson
thinks
lowell
tribute
to
lincoln
occurs
in
the
ode
which
he
wrote
to
commemorate
the
harvard
students
who
enlisted
in
the
civil
war
after
dwelling
on
the
search
for
truth
which
should
be
the
aim
of
every
college
student
he
turns
to
the
delineation
of
lincoln
character
in
a
eulogy
of
great
beauty
clear
in
analysis
in
judgment
and
loving
in
sentiment
he
expresses
that
opinion
of
lincoln
which
has
become
a
part
of
the
web
of
american
thought
his
is
no
hurried
judgment
but
the
calm
statement
of
opinion
which
is
accepted
by
the
world
they
all
are
gone
and
standing
like
a
tower
our
children
shall
behold
his
fame
the
brave
foreseeing
man
sagacious
patient
dreading
praise
not
blame
now
birth
of
our
new
soil
the
first
american
with
oliver
wendell
holmes
comes
the
last
of
this
brief
american
list
of
honor
no
other
american
has
so
combined
delicacy
with
the
new
england
humor
we
should
be
poorer
by
many
a
smile
without
my
aunt
and
the
deacon
masterpiece
but
this
is
not
his
entire
gift
the
chambered
nautilus
strikes
the
chord
of
noble
sentiment
sounded
in
the
last
stanza
of
thanatopsis
and
it
will
continue
to
sing
in
our
hearts
as
the
swift
seasons
roll
there
is
in
his
poems
the
smile
and
the
sigh
of
the
stanza
and
if
i
should
live
to
be
the
last
leaf
upon
the
tree
in
the
spring
let
them
smile
as
i
do
now
as
the
old
forsaken
bough
where
i
cling
and
is
this
all
around
these
few
names
does
all
the
fragrance
of
american
poetry
hover
in
the
hurry
prosperity
and
luxury
of

not
the
last
half
of

the

of

brought
many
beautiful
flowers
of
poetry

of
more
perfect

contemplations
some
time
now
past
in
the
autumnal
tide
when
phoebus
wanted
but
one
hour
to
bed
the
trees
all
richly
clad
yet
void
of
pride
were
gilded
by
his
rich
golden
head
their
leaves
and
fruits
seem
painted
but
was
true
of
green
of
red
of
yellow
mixed
hue
rapt
were
my
senses
at
this
delectable
view
i
wist
not
what
to
wish
yet
sure
thought
i
if
so
much
excellence
abide
below
how
excellent
is
he
that
dwells
on
high
whose
power
and
beauty
by
his
works
we
know
sure
he
is
goodness
wisdom
glory
light
that
hath
this
underworld
so
richly
dight
more
heaven
than
earth
was
here
no
winter
and
no
night
then
on
a
stately
oak
i
cast
mine
eye
whose
ruffling
top
the
clouds
seem
to
aspire
how
long
since
thou
wast
in
thine
infancy
thy
strength
and
stature
more
thy
years
admire
hath
hundred
winters
past
since
thou
wast
born
or
thousand
since
thou
breakest
thy
shell
of
horn
if
so
all
these
as
naught
eternity
doth
scorn
i
heard
the
merry
grasshopper
then
sing
the
cricket
bear
a
second
part
they
kept
one
tune
and
played
on
the
same
string
seeming
to
glory
in
their
little
art
shall
creatures
abject
thus
their
voices
raise
and
in
their
kind
resound
their
master
praise
whilst
i
as
mute
can
warble
forth
no
higher
lays
when
i
behold
the
heavens
as
in
their
prime
and
then
the
earth
though
old
still
clad
in
green
the
stones
and
trees
insensible
of
time
nor
age
nor
wrinkle
on
their
front
are
seen
if
winter
come
and
greenness
then
do
fade
a
spring
returns
and
they
more
youthful

but
man
grows
old

once
laid
michael

the
day
of
doom
sounding
of
the
last
trump
still
was
the
night
serene
bright
when
all

carnal
reason

last
for

take
thine

this
was
their
song
their
cups
among
the
evening
before
wallowing
in
all
kind
of
sin
vile
wretches

secure
the

through

slumber
for
at
midnight
brake
forth
a
light
which
turn
the
night
to

and
speedily
a
hideous
cry
did
all
the
world
dismay
sinners
awake
their
hearts

surprizeth
amaz
with

by
what
they
hear
each
one
of

ariseth
they
rush
from

with
giddy
heads
and
to
their
windows
run
viewing
this
light
which
shines
more
bright
than
doth
the
sun
straightway
appears
they
see
with
tears
the
son
of
god
most
dread
who
with
his
train
comes
on
amain
to
judge
both
quick
and
dead
before
his
face
the
gave
place
and
skies
are
rent
asunder
with
mighty
voice
and
hideous
noise
more
terrible
than
thunder
his
brightness
damps
glorious
lamps
and
makes
them
hang
their
heads
as
if
afraid
and
quite
dismay
they
quit
their
wonted
steads
no
heart
so
bold
but
now
grows
cold
and
almost
dead
with
fear
no
eye
so
dry
but
now
can
cry
and
pour
out
many
a
tear
earth
potentates
and
states
captains
and
men
of
might
are
quite
abasht
their
courage
dasht
at
this
most
dreadful
sight
mean
men
lament
great
men
do
rent
their
robes
and
tear
their
hair
they
do
not
spare
their
flesh
to
tear
through
horrible
despair
all
kindreds
wail
all
hearts
do
fail
horror
the
world
doth
fill
with
weeping
eyes
and
loud
yet
knows
not
how
to
kill
some
hide
themselves
in
caves
and
delves
in
places
under
ground
some
rashly
leap
into
the
deep
to
scape
by
being
drown
some
to
the
rocks
o
senseless
blocks
and
woody
mountains
run
that
there
they
might
this
fearful
sight
and
dreaded
presence
shun
in

do
they
to
mountains
say
fall
on
us
and
us
hide
from
judges
ire
more
hot
than
fire
for
who
may
it
abide
no

can
from
his

sinners
at
all
conceal

every

doth
more
than

the
mountains
smoak
the
hills

shook
the

torn
as
if

the

doth
roar
forsakes
the
shore
and
shrinks
away
for
fear
the

into
the
sea
so
soon
as
he
draws
near
before
his
throne
a
trump
is
blown
proclaiming
the
day
of

cries
ye

unto

bodies
all
rise
at

hosts
flie
through

together
gathering
both
good

both
quick

all
to

the

thee
here
no

bade
thee
shun

quietly
thy
summer
goes
thy
days
declining
to
repose
smit
with
those
charms
that
must
decay

your

the
flowers
that

unpitying

an
hour
the
frail
duration
of
a
flower
to
a

did
storms
harass

perplex
did

did
wars
distress
or

vex
or
did
you

a

you

on

welcome
i
hail
you
to

all
welcome

here
let
the
cloud

pass
here
be
all
care
resigned
this
fluid
never
fails
to
please
and
drown
the
griefs
of
men
or
bees
what
forced
you
here
we
can
not
know
and
you
will
scarcely
tell
but
cheery
we
would
have
you
go
and
bid
a
glad
farewell
on
lighter
wings
we
bid
you
fly
your
dart
will
now
all
foes
defy
yet
take
not
oh
too
deep
a
drink
and
in
this
ocean
die
here
bigger
bees
than
you
might
sink
even
bees
full
six
feet
high
like
pharaoh
then
you
would
be
said
to
perish
in
a
sea
of
red
do
as
you
please
your
will
is
mine
enjoy
it
without
fear
and
your
grave
will
be
this
glass
of

your
epitaph
a

go
take
your

in

we
tell
the
hive
you
died
afloat
the
indian
in
spite
of
all
the
learned
have
said
i
still
my
old
opinion
keep
the
posture
that
we
give
the
dead
points
out
the
soul
eternal
sleep
not
so
the
ancients
of
these
lands
the
indian
when
from
life
released
again
is
seated
with
his
friends
and
shares
again
the
joyous
feast
his
imaged
birds
and
painted
bowl
and
venison
for
a
journey
dressed
bespeak
the
nature
of
the
soul
activity
that
wants
no
rest
his
bow
for
action
ready
bent
and
arrows
with
a
head
of
stone
can
only
mean
that
life
is
spent
and
not
the
old
ideas
gone
thou
stranger
that
shalt
come
this
way
no
fraud
upon
the
dead
commit
observe
the
swelling
turf
and
say
they
do
not
die
but
here
they
sit
here
still
a
lofty
rock
remains
on
which
the
curious
eye
may
trace
now
wasted
half
by
wearing
rains
the
fancies
of
a
ruder
race
here
still
an
aged
elm
aspires
beneath
whose
far
projecting
shade
and
which
the
shepherd
still
admires
children
of
the
forest
played
there
oft
a
restless
indian
queen
pale
shebah
with
her
braided
hair
and
many
a
barbarous
form
is
seen
to
chide
the
man
that
lingers
there
by
midnight
moons
moistening
dews
in
habit
for
the
chase
arrayed
the
hunter
still
the
deer
pursues
the
hunter
and
the

a
shade
and
long
shall
timorous
fancy
see
the
painted
chief
and
pointed
spear

how
many

are
no
more
if
in
this
wreck
of
ruin
they
can
yet
be
thought
to
claim
a
tear
o
smite
thy
gentle
breast
and
say
the
friends
of
freedom
slumber
here
thou
who
shalt
trace
this
bloody
plain
if
goodness
rules
thy
generous

sigh
for
the
wasted
rural
reign
sigh
for
the
shepherds
sunk

not
the

they
saw
their
injured
country
woe
the
flaming
town
the
wasted
field
then
rushed
to
meet
the
insulting
foe
they
took
the
spear
but
left
the
shield
led
by
thy
conquering
standards
greene
the
britons
they
compelled
to
fly

none
grieved
in
such
a

like
the
parthian
famed
of

who
flying
still
their
arrows
threw
these
routed
britons
full
as
bold
retreated
and
retreating
slew
now
rest
in
peace
our
patriot
band

far
from

thrown

trust
they
find
a
happier

of

kegs
gallants
attend
and
hear
a
friend
trill
forth
harmonious
ditty
strange
things
i
tell
which
late
befell
in
philadelphia
city
was
early
day
as
poets
say
just
when
the
sun
was
rising
a
soldier
stood
on
a
log
of
wood
and
saw
a
thing
surprising
as
in
amaze
he
stood
to
gaze
the
truth
ca
be
denied
sir
he
spied
a
score
of
kegs
or
more
come
floating
down
the
tide
sir
a
sailor
too
in
jerkin
blue
this
strange
appearance
viewing
first
damned
his
eyes
in
great
surprise
then
said
some
mischief
brewing
these
kegs
i
told
the
rebels
hold
packed
up
like
pickled
herring
and
they
come
down
to
attack
the
town
in
this
new
way
of
ferrying
the
soldier
flew
the
sailor
too
and
scared
almost
to
death
sir
wore
out
their
shoes
to
spread
the
news
and
ran
till
out
of
breath
sir
now
up
and
down
throughout
the
town
most
frantic
scenes
were
acted
and
some
ran
here
and
others
there
like
men
almost
distracted
some
fire
cried
which
some
denied
but
said
the
earth
had
quaked
and
girls
and
boys
with
hideous
noise
ran
through
the
streets
half
naked
sir
william
he
snug
as
a
flea
lay
all
this
time
a
snoring
nor
dreamed
of
harm
as
he
lay
warm
in
bed
with
loring
now
in
a
fright
he
starts
upright
awaked
by
such
a
clatter
he
rubs
both
eyes
and
boldly
cries
for
god
sake
what
the
matter
at
his
bedside
he
then
espied
sir
erskine
at
command
sir
upon
one
foot
he
had
one
boot
and
th
other
in
his
hand
sir
arise
arise
sir
erskine
cries
the
rebels
more
the
pity
without
a
boat
are
all
afloat
and
ranged
before
the
city
the
motley
crew
in
vessels
new
with
satan
for
their
guide
sir
packed
up
in
bags
or
wooden
kegs
come
driving
down
the
tide
sir
therefore
prepare
for
bloody
war
these
kegs
must
all
be
routed
or
surely
we
despised
shall
be
and
british
courage
doubted
the
royal
band
now
ready
stand
all
ranged
in
dread
array
sir
with
stomach
stout
to
see
it
out
and
make
a
bloody
day
sir
the
cannons
roar
from
shore
to
shore
the
small
arms
make
a
rattle
since
wars
began
i
sure
no
man
saw
so
strange
a
battle
the
rebel
dales
the
rebel
vales
with
rebel
trees
surrounded
the
distant
woods
the
hills
and
floods
with
rebel
echoes
sounded
the
fish
below
swam
to
and
fro
attacked
from
every
quarter
why
sure
thought
they
the
devil
to
pay
folks
above
the
water
the
kegs
is
said
though
strongly
made
of
rebel
staves
and
hoops
sir
could
not
oppose
their
powerful
foes
the
conquering
british
troops
sir
from
morn
to
night
these
men
of
might
displayed
amazing
courage
and
when
the
sun
was
fairly
down
retired
to
sup
their
porridge
a
hundred
men
with
each
a
pen
or
more
upon
my
word
sir
it
is
most
true
would
be
too
few
their
valor
to
record
sir
such
feats
did
they
perform
that
day
against
these
wicked
kegs
sir
that
years
to
come
if
they
get
home
they
make
their
boasts
and
brags

when

ourselves

us
we

we
pray
for

never

therefore
no

how
dear
to
this

are
the
scenes
of
my
childhood
when
fond
recollection
presents
them
to
view
the
orchard
the
meadow
the
and
every
loved
spot
which
my
infancy
knew
the
pond

the
mill
that
stood
by
it

the
rock
where
the
cataract
fell
the
cot
of
my
father
the
nigh
it
and
the
rude
bucket
that
hung
in
the
well
the
old
oaken
bucket
the
bucket
the
bucket
which
hung
in
the
well
that
vessel
i
hailed
as
a
treasure
for
often
at
noon
when
returned
from
the
field
i
found
it
the
source
of
an
exquisite
pleasure
the
purest
and
sweetest
that
nature
can
yield
how
ardent
i
seized
it
with
hands
that
were
glowing
and
quick
to
the
bottom
it
fell
then
soon
with
the
emblem
of
truth
overflowing
and
dripping
with
coolness
it
rose
from
the
well
the
old
oaken
bucket
the
bucket
the
bucket
arose
from
the
well
how
sweet
from
the
green
mossy
brim
to
receive
it
as
poised
on
the
curb
it
inclined
to
my
lips
not
a
full
blushing
goblet
could
tempt
me
to
leave
it
the
brightest
that
beauty
or
revelry
sips
and
now
far
removed
from
the
loved
habitation
the
tear
of
regret
will
intrusively
swell
as
fancy
reverts
to
my
father
plantation
and
sighs
for
the
bucket
that
hangs
in
the
well

oaken
bucket

that
steals
away
their
sharpness
ere
he
is
aware
when
thoughts
of
the

bitter
hour
come
like

over
thy
spirit
and
sad
images
of
the
stern
agony

thee

to

while
from

comes
a

a

thee
the
sun
shall
see
no
more
in

course
nor

in
the
cold
ground

thy
pale
form
was
laid
with
many
tears
nor

embrace
of

exist
thy
image

that
nourished
thee
shall
claim
thy
growth
to
be
resolved

earth
again
and
lost
each
human
trace
surrendering
up
thine
individual
being
shalt
thou
go
to
mix
forever
with
the

to
be
a

the
insensible
rock
and
to
the
sluggish
clod
which
the
rude
swain
turns
with

share
and
treads
upon
the
oak
shall
send
his
roots
abroad
and
pierce
thy
mould
yet
not
to
thine
eternal
resting
place
shalt
thou
retire
alone
nor
couldst
thou
wish
couch
more
magnificent
thou
shalt
lie
down
with
patriarchs
of
the
infant
world
with
kings
the
powerful
of
the
earth
the
wise
the
good
fair
forms
and
hoary
seers
of
ages
past
all
in

mighty
sepulchre
the
hills
and
ancient
as
the
sun
the
vales
stretching
in
pensive
quietness
between
the
venerable
woods
rivers
that
move
in
majesty
and
the
complaining
brooks
that
make
the
meadows
green
and
poured
round
all
old
ocean
gray
and
melancholy
waste
are
but
the
solemn
decorations
all
of
the
great
tomb
of
man
the
golden
sun
the
planets
all
the
infinite
host
of
heaven
are
shining
on
the
sad
abodes
of
death
through
the
still
lapse
of
ages
all
that
tread
the
globe
are
but
a
handful
to
the
tribes
that
slumber
in
its
take
the
wings
of
morning
pierce
the
barcan
wilderness
or
lose
thyself
in
the
continuous
woods
where
rolls
the
oregon
and
hears
no
sound
save
his
own
dashing
yet
the
dead
are
there
and
millions
in
those
solitudes
since
first
the
flight
of
years
began
have
laid
them
down
in
their
last
sleep
the
dead
reign
there
alone
so
shalt
thou
rest
and
what
if
thou
withdraw
in
silence
from
the
living
and
no
friend
take
note
of
thy
departure
all
that
breathe
will
share
thy
destiny
the
gay
will
laugh
when
thou
art
gone
the
solemn
brood
of
care
plod
on
and
each
one
as
before
will
chase
his
favorite
phantom
yet
all
these
shall
leave
their
mirth
and
their
employments
and
shall
come
and
make
their
bed
with
thee
as
the
long
train
of
ages
glides
away
the
sons
of
men
the
youth
in
life
green
spring
and
he
who
goes
in
the
full
strength
of
years
matron
and
maid
the
speechless
babe
and
the
grayheaded
man
shall
one
by
one
be
gathered
to
thy
side
by
those
who
in
their
turn
shall
follow
them
so
live
that
when
thy
summons
comes
to
join
the
innumerable
caravan
which
moves
to
that
mysterious
realm
where
each
shall
take
his
chamber
in
the
silent
halls
of
death
thou
go
not
like
the
at
night
scourged
to
his
dungeon
but
sustained
and
soothed
by
an
unfaltering
trust
approach
thy
grave
like
one
who
wraps
the
drapery
of
his
couch
about
him
and
lies
down
to
pleasant
dreams
the
yellow
violet
when
beechen
buds
begin
to
swell
and
woods
the
warble
know
the
yellow
violet
modest
bell
peeps
from
the
last
year
leaves
below
ere
russet
fields
their
green
resume
sweet
flower
i
love
in
forest
bare
to
meet
thee
when
thy
faint
perfume
alone
is
in
the
virgin
air
of
all
her
train
the
hands
of
spring
first
plant
thee
in
the
watery
mould
and
i
have
seen
thee
blossoming
beside
the
edges
cold
thy
parent
sun
who
bade
thee
view
pale
skies
and
chilling
moisture
sip
has
bathed
thee
in
his
own
bright
hue
and
streaked
with
jet
thy
glowing
lip
yet
slight
thy
form
and
low
thy
seat
and
earthward
bent
thy
gentle
eye
unapt
the
passing
view
to
meet
when
loftier
flowers
are
flaunting
nigh
oft
in
the
sunless
april
day
thy
early
smile
has
stayed
my
walk
but
midst
the
gorgeous
blooms
of
may
i
passed
thee
on
thy
humble
stalk
so
they
who
climb
to
wealth
forget
the
friends
in
darker
fortunes
tried
i
copied
them
but
i
regret
that
i
should
ape
the
ways
of
pride
and
when
again
the
genial
hour
awakes
the
painted
tribes
of
light
i
not
the
modest
flower
that
made
the
woods
of
april
bright
to
a
waterfowl
whither
midst
falling
dew
while
glow
the
heavens
with
the
last
steps
of
day
far
through
their
rosy
depths
dost
thou
pursue
thy
solitary
way
vainly
the
fowler
eye
might
mark
thy
distant
flight
to
do
thee
wrong
as
darkly
painted
on
the
crimson
sky
thy
figure
floats
along
thou
the
plashy
brink
of
weedy
lake
or
marge
of
river
wide
or
where
the
rocking
billows
rise
and
sink
on
the
chafed
there
is
a
power
whose
care
teaches
thy
way
along
that
pathless
coast
the
desert
and
illimitable
air
lone
wandering
but
not
lost
all
day
thy
wings
have
fanned
at
that
far
height
the
cold
thin
atmosphere
yet
stoop
not
weary
to
the
welcome
land
though
the
dark
night
is
near
and
soon
that
toil
shall
end
soon
shalt
thou
find
a
summer
home
and
rest
and
scream
among
thy
fellows
reeds
shall
bend
soon
thy
sheltered
nest
gone
the
abyss
of
heaven
hath
swallowed
up
thy
form
yet
in
my
heart
deeply
has
sunk
the
lesson
thou
hast
given
and
shall
not
soon
depart
he
who
from
zone
to
zone
guides
through
the
boundless
sky
thy
certain
flight
in
the
long
way
that
i
must
tread
alone
will
lead
my
steps
aright
green
river
when
breezes
are
soft
and
skies
are
fair
i
steal
an
hour
from
study
and
care
and
hie
me
away
to
the
woodland
scene
where
wanders
the
stream
with
waters
of
green
as
if
the
bright
fringe
of
herbs
on
its
brink
had
given
their
stain
to
the
waves
they
drink
and
they
whose
meadows
it
murmurs
through
have
named
the
stream
from
its
own
fair
hue
yet
pure
its
waters
its
shallows
are
bright
with
colored
pebbles
and
sparkles
of
light
and
clear
the
depths
where
its
eddies
play
and
dimples
deepen
and
whirl
away
and
the
speckled
arms
the
swifter
current
that
mines
its
root
through
whose
shifting
leaves
as
you
walk
the
hill
the
quivering
glimmer
of
sun
and
rill
with
a
sudden
flash
on
the
eye
is
thrown
like
the
ray
that
streams
from
the
oh
loveliest
there
the
spring
days
come
with
blossoms
and
birds
and
hum
the
flowers
of
summer
are
fairest
there
and
freshest
the
breath
of
the
summer
air
and
sweetest
the
golden
autumn
day
in
silence
and
sunshine
glides
away
yet
fair
as
thou
art
thou
shunnest
to
glide
beautiful
stream
by
the
village
side
but
windest
away
from
haunts
of
men
to
quiet
valley
and
shaded
glen
and
forest
and
meadow
and
slope
of
hill
around
thee
are
lonely
lovely
and
still
lonely
save
when
by
thy
rippling
tides
from
thicket
to
thicket
the
angler
glides
or
the
simpler
comes
with
basket
and
book
for
herbs
of
power
on
thy
banks
to
look
or
haply
some
idle
dreamer
like
me
to
wander
and
muse
and
gaze
on
thee
still
save
the
chirp
of
birds
that
feed
on
the
river
cherry
and
seedy
reed
and
thy
own
wild
music
gushing
out
with
mellow
murmur
of
fairy
shout
from
dawn
to
the
blush
of
another
day
like
traveller
singing
along
his
way
that
fairy
music
i
never
hear
nor
gaze
on
those
waters
so
green
and
clear
and
mark
them
winding
away
from
sight
darkened
with
shade
or
flashing
with
light
while
them
the
vine
to
its
thicket
clings
and
the
zephyr
stoops
to
freshen
his
wings
but
i
wish
that
fate
had
left
me
free
to
wander
these
quiet
haunts
with
thee
till
the
eating
cares
of
earth
should
depart
and
the
peace
of
the
scene
pass
into
my
heart
and
i
envy
thy
stream
as
it
glides
along
through
its
beautiful
banks
in
a
trance
of
song
though
forced
to
drudge
for
the
dregs
of
men
and
scrawl
strange
words
with
the
barbarous
pen
and
mingle
among
the
jostling
crowd
where
the
sons
of
strife
are
subtle
and
loud
i
often
come
to
this
quiet
place
to
breathe
the
airs
that
ruffle
thy
face
and
gaze
upon
thee
in
silent
dream
for
in
thy
lonely
and
lovely
stream
an
image
of
that
calm
life
appears
that
won
my
heart
in
my
greener
years
the
west
wind
beneath
the
forest
skirt
i
rest
whose
branching
pines
rise
dark
and
high
and
hear
the
breezes
of
the
west
among
the
foliage
sigh
sweet
zephyr
why
that
sound
of
woe
is
not
thy
home
among
the
flowers
do
not
the
bright
june
roses
blow
to
meet
thy
kiss
at
morning
hours
and
lo
thy
glorious
realm
outspread
yon
stretching
valleys
green
and
gay
and
yon
free
whose
head
the
loose
white
clouds
are
borne
away
and
there
the
full
broad
river
runs
and
many
a
fount
wells
fresh
and
sweet
to
cool
thee
when
the
suns
have
made
thee
faint
beneath
their
heat
thou
wind
of
joy
and
youth
and
love
spirit
of
the
year
the
sun
in
his
blue
realm
above
smooths
a
bright
path
when
thou
art
here
in
lawns
the
murmuring
bee
is
heard
the
wooing
in
the
shade
on
thy
soft
breath
the
bird
takes
wing
half
happy
half
afraid
ah
thou
art
like
our
wayward
race
when
not
a
shade
of
pain
or
ill
dims
the
bright
smile
of
nature
face
thou
to
sigh
and
murmur
still
i
broke
the
spell
that
held
me
long
i
broke
the
spell
that
held
me
long
the
dear
dear
witchery
of
song
i
said
the
poet
idle
lore
shall
waste
my
prime
of
years
no
more
for
poetry
though
heavenly
born
consorts
with
poverty
and
scorn
i
broke
the
spell
nor
deemed
its
power
could
fetter
me
another
hour
ah
thoughtless
how
could
i
forget
its
causes
were
around
me
yet
for
i
looked
the
while
was
nature
everlasting
smile
still
came
and
lingered
on
my
sight
of
flowers
and
streams
the
bloom
and
light
and
glory
of
the
stars
and
sun
and
these
and
poetry
are
one
they
ere
the
world
had
held
me
long
recalled
me
to
the
love
of
song
a
forest
hymn
the
groves
were
god
first
temples
ere
man
learned
to
hew
the
shaft
and
lay
the
architrave
and
spread
the
roof
above
them
ere
he
framed
the
lofty
vault
to
gather
and
roll
back
the
sound
of
anthems
in
the
darkling
wood
amid
the
cool
and
silence
he
knelt
down
and
offered
to
the
mightiest
solemn
thanks
and
supplication
for
his
simple
heart
might
not
resist
the
sacred
influences
which
from
the
stilly
twilight
of
the
place
and
from
the
gray
old
trunks
that
high
in
heaven
mingled
their
mossy
boughs
and
from
the
sound
of
the
invisible
breath
that
swayed
at
once
all
their
green
tops
stole
over
him
and
bowed
his
spirit
with
the
thought
of
boundless
power
and
inaccessible
majesty
ah
why
should
we
in
the
world
riper
years
neglect
god
ancient
sanctuaries
and
adore
only
among
the
crowd
and
under
roofs
that
our
frail
hands
have
raised
let
me
at
least
here
in
the
shadow
of
this
aged
wood
offer
one
hymn
thrice
happy
if
it
find
acceptance
in
his
ear
father
thy
hand
hath
reared
these
venerable
columns
thou
didst
weave
this
verdant
roof
thou
didst
look
down
upon
the
naked
earth
and
forthwith
rose
all
these
fair
ranks
of
trees
they
in
thy
sun
budded
and
shook
their
green
leaves
in
thy
breeze
and
shot
toward
heaven
the
crow
whose
birth
was
in
their
tops
grew
old
and
died
among
their
branches
till
at
last
they
stood
as
now
they
stand
massy
and
tall
and
dark
fit
shrine
for
humble
worshipper
to
hold
communion
with
his
maker
these
dim
vaults
these
winding
aisles
of
human
pomp
or
pride
report
not
no
fantastic
carvings
show
the
boast
of
our
vain
race
to
change
the
form
of
thy
fair
works
but
thou
art
here
thou
the
solitude
thou
art
in
the
soft
winds
that
run
along
the
summit
of
these
trees
in
music
thou
art
in
the
cooler
breath
that
from
the
inmost
darkness
of
the
place
comes
scarcely
felt
the
barley
trunks
the
ground
the
fresh
moist
ground
are
all
instinct
with
thee
here
is
continual
worship
nature
here
in
the
tranquillity
that
thou
dost
love
enjoys
thy
presence
noiselessly
around
from
perch
to
perch
the
solitary
bird
passes
and
yon
clear
spring
that
midst
its
herbs
wells
softly
forth
and
wandering
steeps
the
roots
of
half
the
mighty
forest
tells
no
tale
of
all
the
good
it
does
thou
halt
not
left
thyself
without
a
witness
in
the
shades
of
thy
perfections
grandeur
strength
and
grace
are
here
to
speak
of
thee
this
mighty
oak
by
whose
immovable
stem
i
stand
and
seem
almost
annihilated
not
a
prince
in
all
that
proud
old
world
beyond
the
deep
wore
his
crown
as
loftily
as
he
wears
the
green
coronal
of
leaves
with
which
thy
hand
has
graced
him
nestled
at
his
root
is
beauty
such
as
blooms
not
in
the
glare
of
the
broad
sun
that
delicate
forest
flower
with
scented
breath
and
look
so
like
a
smile
seems
as
it
issues
from
the
shapeless
mould
au
emanation
of
the
indwelling
life
a
visible
token
of
the
upholding
love
that
are
the
soul
of
this
great
universe
my
heart
is
awed
within
me
when
i
think
of
the
great
miracle
that
still
goes
on
in
silence
round
me
the
perpetual
work
of
thy
creation
finished
yet
renewed
forever
written
on
thy
works
i
read
the
lesson
of
thy
own
eternity
lo
all
grow
old
and
die
but
see
again
how
on
the
faltering
footsteps
of
decay
youth
presses
ever
gay
and
beautiful
youth
in
all
its
beautiful
forms
these
lofty
trees
wave
not
less
proudly
that
their
ancestors
moulder
beneath
them
oh
there
is
not
lost
one
of
earth
charms
upon
her
bosom
yet
after
the
flight
of
untold
centuries
the
freshness
of
her
far
beginning
lies
and
yet
shall
lie
life
mocks
the
idle
hate
of
his
death
yea
seats
himself
upon
the
tyrant
throne
the
sepulchre
and
of
the
triumphs
of
his
ghastly
foe
makes
his
own
nourishment
for
he
came
forth
from
thine
own
bosom
and
shall
have
no
end
there
have
been
holy
men
who
hid
themselves
deep
in
the
woody
wilderness
and
gave
their
lives
to
thought
and
prayer
till
they
outlived
the
generation
born
with
them
nor
seemed
less
aged
than
the
hoary
trees
and
rocks
around
them
and
there
have
been
holy
men
who
deemed
it
were
not
well
to
pass
life
thus
but
let
me
often
to
these
solitudes
retire
and
in
thy
presence
reassure
my
feeble
virtue
here
its
enemies
the
passions
at
thy
plainer
footsteps
shrink
and
tremble
and
are
still
o
god
when
thou
dost
scare
the
world
with
tempest
set
on
fire
the
heavens
with
falling
thunderbolts
or
fill
with
all
the
waters
of
the
firmament
the
swift
dark
whirlwind
that
uproots
the
woods
and
drowns
the
villages
when
at
thy
call
uprises
the
great
deep
and
throws
himself
upon
the
continent
and
overwhelms
its
cities
who
forgets
not
at
the
sight
of
these
tremendous
tokens
of
thy
power
his
pride
and
lays
his
strifes
and
follies
by
oh
from
these
sterner
aspects
of
thy
face
spare
me
and
mine
nor
let
us
need
the
wrath
of
the
mad
unchained
elements
to
teach
who
rules
them
be
it
ours
to
meditate
in
these
calm
shades
thy
milder
majesty
and
to
the
beautiful
order
of
thy
works
learn
to
conform
the
order
of
our
lives
the
death
of
the
flowers
the
melancholy
days
are
come
the
saddest
of
the
year
of
wailing
winds
and
naked
woods
and
meadows
brown
and
sere
heaped
in
the
hollows
of
the
grove
the
autumn
leaves
lie
dead
they
rustle
to
the
eddying
gust
and
to
the
rabbit
tread
the
robin
and
the
wren
are
flown
and
from
the
shrubs
the
jay
and
from
the
calls
the
crow
through
all
the
gloomy
day
where
are
the
flowers
the
fair
young
flowers
that
lately
sprang
and
stood
in
brighter
light
and
softer
airs
a
beauteous
sisterhood
alas
they
all
are
in
their
graves
the
gentle
race
of
flowers
are
lying
in
their
lowly
beds
with
the
fair
and
good
of
ours
the
rain
is
falling
where
they
lie
but
the
cold
november
rain
calls
not
from
out
the
gloomy
earth
the
lovely
ones
again
the
and
the
violet
they
perished
long
ago
and
the
and
the
orchis
died
amid
the
summer
glow
but
on
the
hills
the
and
the
aster
in
the
wood
and
the
yellow
by
the
brook
in
autumn
beauty
stood
till
fell
the
frost
from
the
clear
cold
heaven
as
falls
the
plague
on
men
and
the
brightness
of
their
smile
was
gone
from
upland
glade
and
glen
and
now
when
comes
the
calm
mild
day
as
still
such
days
will
come
to
call
the
squirrel
and
the
bee
from
out
their
winter
home
when
the
sound
of
dropping
nuts
is
heard
though
all
the
trees
are
still
and
twinkle
in
the
smoky
light
the
waters
of
the
rill
the
south
wind
searches
for
the
flowers
whose
fragrance
late
he
bore
and
sighs
to
find
them
in
the
wood
and
by
the
stream
no
more
and
then
i
think
of
one
who
in
her
youthful
beauty
died
the
fair
meek
blossom
that
grew
up
and
faded
by
my
side
in
the
cold
moist
earth
we
laid
her
when
the
forests
cast
the
leaf
and
we
wept
that
one
so
lovely
should
have
a
life
so
brief
yet
not
unmeet
it
was
that
one
like
that
young
friend
of
ours
so
gentle
and
so
beautiful
should
perish
with
the
flowers
the
gladness
of
nature
is
this
a
time
to
be
cloudy
and
sad
when
our
mother
nature
laughs
around
when
even
the
deep
blue
heavens
look
glad
and
gladness
breathes
from
the
blossoming
ground
there
are
notes
of
joy
from
the
and
wren
and
the
gossip
of
swallows
through
all
the
sky
the
gayly
chirps
by
his
den
and
the
wilding
bee
hums
merrily
by
the
clouds
are
at
play
in
the
azure
space
and
their
shadows
at
play
on
the
vale
and
here
they
stretch
to
the
frolic
chase
and
there
they
roll
on
the
easy
gale
there
a
dance
of
leaves
in
that
aspen
bower
there
a
titter
of
winds
in
that
beechen
tree
there
a
smile
on
the
fruit
and
a
smile
on
the
flower
and
a
laugh
from
the
brook
that
runs
to
the
sea
and
look
at
the
sun
how
he
smiles
on
the
dewy
earth
that
smiles
in
his
ray
on
the
leaping
waters
and
gay
young
isles
ay
look
and
he
smile
thy
gloom
away
to
the
fringed
gentian
thou
blossom
bright
with
autumn
dew
and
colored
with
the
heaven
own
blue
that
openest
when
the
quiet
light
succeeds
the
keen
and
frosty
night
thou
comest
not
when
violets
lean
wandering
brooks
and
springs
unseen
or
columbines
in
purple
dressed
nod
the
hidden
nest
thou
waitest
late
and
alone
when
woods
are
bare
and
birds
are
flown
and
frosts
and
shortening
days
portend
the
aged
year
is
near
his
end
then
doth
thy
sweet
and
quiet
eye
look
through
its
fringes
to
the
sky
blue
blue
as
if
that
sky
let
fall
a
flower
from
its
cerulean
wall
i
would
that
thus
when
i
shall
see
the
hour
of
death
draw
near
to
me
hope
blossoming
within
my
heart
may
look
to
heaven
as
i
depart
song
of
marion
men
our
band
is
few
but
true
and
tried
our
leader
frank
and
bold
the
british
soldier
trembles
when
marion
name
is
told
our
fortress
is
the
good
greenwood
our
tent
the
we
know
the
forest
round
us
as
seamen
know
the
sea
we
know
its
walls
of
thorny
vines
its
glades
of
reedy
grass
its
safe
and
silent
islands
within
the
dark
morass
woe
to
the
english
soldiery
that
little
dread
us
near
on
them
shall
light
at
midnight
a
strange
and
sudden
fear
when
waking
to
their
tents
on
fire
they
grasp
their
arms
in
vain
and
they
who
stand
to
face
us
are
beat
to
earth
again
and
they
who
fly
in
terror
deem
a
mighty
host
behind
and
hear
the
tramp
of
thousands
upon
the
hollow
wind
then
sweet
the
hour
that
brings
release
from
danger
and
from
toil
we
talk
the
battle
over
and
share
the
battle
spoil
the
woodland
rings
with
laugh
and
shout
as
if
a
hunt
were
up
and
woodland
flowers
are
gathered
to
crown
the
soldier
cup
with
merry
songs
we
mock
the
wind
that
in
the
grieves
and
slumber
long
and
sweetly
on
beds
of
oaken
leaves
well
knows
the
fair
and
friendly
moon
the
band
that
marion
leads
the
glitter
of
their
rifles
the
scampering
of
their
steeds
is
life
to
guide
the
fiery
barb
across
the
moonlight
plain
is
life
to
feel
the
that
lifts
the
tossing
mane
a
moment
in
the
british
camp
a
moment
and
away
back
to
the
pathless
forest
before
the
peep
of
day
grave
men
there
are
by
broad
santee
grave
men
with
hoary
hairs
their
hearts
are
all
with
marion
for
marion
are
their
prayers
and
lovely
ladies
greet
our
band
with
kindliest
welcoming
with
smiles
like
those
of
summer
and
tears
like
those
of
spring
for
them
we
wear
these
trusty
arms
and
lay
them
down
no
more
till
we
have
driven
the
briton
forever
from
our
shore
the
crowded
street
let
me
move
slowly
through
the
street
filled
with
an
train
amid
the
sound
of
steps
that
beat
the
murmuring
walks
like
autumn
rain
how
fast
the
flitting
figures
come
the
mild
the
fierce
the
stony
face
some
bright
with
thoughtless
smiles
and
some
where
secret
tears
have
left
their
trace
they
pass
to
toil
to
strife
to
rest
to
halls
in
which
the
feast
is
spread
to
chambers
where
the
funeral
guest
in
silence
sits
beside
the
dead
and
some
to
happy
homes
repair
where
children
pressing
cheek
to
cheek
these
struggling
tides
of
life
that
seem
with
mute
caresses
shall
declare
the
tenderness
they
can
not
speak
and
some
who
walk
in
calmness
here
shall
shudder
as
they
reach
the
door
where
one
who
made
their
dwelling
dear
its
flower
its
light
is
seen
no
more
youth
with
pale
cheek
and
slender
frame
and
dreams
of
greatness
in
thine
eye
thou
to
build
an
early
name
or
early
in
the
task
to
die
keen
son
of
trade
with
eager
brow
who
is
now
fluttering
in
thy
snare
thy
golden
fortunes
tower
they
now
or
melt
the
glittering
spires
in
air
who
of
this
crowd
shall
tread
the
dance
till
daylight
gleam
again
who
sorrow
the
untimely
dead
who
writhe
in
throes
of
mortal
pain
some
shall
think
how
long
the
cold
dark
hours
how
slow
the
light
and
some
who
flaunt
amid
the
throng
shall
hide
in
dens
of
shame
each
where
his
tasks
or
pleasures
call
they
pass
and
heed
each
other
not
there
is
who
heeds
who
holds
them
all
in
his
large
love
and
boundless
thought
these
struggling
tides
of
life
that
seem
in
wayward
aimless
course
to
tend
are
eddies
of
the
mighty
stream
that
rolls
to
its
appointed
end
the
stand
here
by
my
side
and
turn
i
pray
on
the
lake
below
thy
gentle
eyes
the
clouds
hang
over
it
heavy
and
gray
and
dark
and
silent
the
water
lies
and
out
of
that
frozen
mist
the
snow
in
wavering
flakes
begins
to
flow
flake
after
flake
they
sink
in
the
dark
and
silent
lake
see
how
in
a
living
swarm
they
come
from
the
chambers
beyond
that
misty
veil
some
hover
awhile
in
air
and
some
rush
prone
from
the
sky
like
summer
hail
all
dropping
swiftly
or
settling
slow
west
and
are
still
in
the
depths
below
flake
after
flake
dissolved
in
the
dark
and
silent
lake
here
delicate
out
of
the
cloud
come
floating
downward
in
airy
play
like
spangles
dropped
from
the
glistening
crowd
that
whiten
by
night
the
milky
way
there
broader
and
burlier
masses
fall
the
sullen
water
buries
them
all
flake
after
flake
all
drowned
in
the
dark
and
silent
lake
and
some
as
on
tender
wings
they
glide
from
their
chilly
dim
and
gray
are
joined
in
their
fall
and
side
by
side
come
clinging
along
their
unsteady
way
as
friend
with
friend
or
husband
with
wife
makes
hand
in
hand
the
passage
of
life
each
mated
flake
soon
sinks
in
the
dark
and
silent
lake
lo
while
we
are
gazing
in
swifter
haste
stream
down
the
snows
till
the
air
is
white
as
myriads
by
myriads
madly
chased
they
fling
themselves
from
their
shadowy
height
the
fair
frail
creatures
of
middle
sky
what
speed
they
make
with
their
grave
so
nigh
flake
after
flake
to
lie
in
the
dark
and
silent
lake
i
see
in
thy
gentle
eyes
a
tear
they
turn
to
me
in
sorrowful
thought
thou
thinkest
of
friends
the
good
and
dear
who
were
for
a
time
and
now
are
not
like
those
fair
children
and
cloud
and
frost
that
glisten
for
a
moment
and
then
are
lost
flake
after
flake
all
lost
in
the
dark
and
silent
lake
yet
look
again
for
the
clouds
divide
a
gleam
of
blue
on
the
water
lies
and
far
away
on
the
a
sunbeam
falls
from
the
opening
skies
but
the
hurrying
host
that
flew
between
the
cloud
and
the
water
no
more
is
seen
flake
after
flake
at
rest
in
the
dark
and
silent
lake

when

merry
old
strain
robert

come
back
again
chee
chee
chee
the
poet
thou
who
wouldst
wear
the
name
of
poet
mid
thy
brethren
of
mankind
and
clothe
in
words
of
flame
thoughts
that
shall
live
within
the
general
mind
deem
not
the
framing
of
a
deathless
lay
the
pastime
of
a
drowsy
summer
day
but
gather
all
thy
powers
and
wreak
them
on
the
verse
that
thou
dust
weave
and
in
thy
lonely
hours
at
silent
morning
or
at
wakeful
eve
while
the
warm
current
tingles
through
thy
veins
set
forth
the
burning
words
in
fluent
strains
no
smooth
array
of
phrase
artfully
sought
and
ordered
though
it
be
which
the
cold
rhymer
lays
upon
his
page
with
languid
industry
can
wake
the
listless
pulse
to
livelier
speed
or
fill
with
sudden
tears
the
eyes
that
read
the
secret
wouldst
thou
know
to
touch
the
heart
or
fire
the
blood
at
will
let
thine
own
eyes
let
thy
lips
quiver
with
the
passionate
thrill
seize
the
great
thought
ere
yet
its
power
be
past
and
bind
in
words
the
fleet
emotion
fast
then
should
thy
verse
appear
halting
and
harsh
and
all
unaptly
wrought
touch
the
crude
line
with
fear
save
in
the
moment
of
impassioned
thought
then
summon
back
the
original
glow
and
mend
the
strain
with
rapture
that
with
fire
was
penned
yet
let
no
empty
gust
of
passion
find
an
utterance
in
thy
lay
a
blast
that
whirls
the
dust
along
the
howling
street
and
dies
away
but
feelings
of
calm
power
and
mighty
sweep
like
currents
journeying
through
the
windless
deep
thou
in
living
lays
to
limn
the
beauty
of
the
earth
and
sky
before
thine
inner
gaze
let
all
that
beauty
in
clear
vision
lie
look
on
it
with
exceeding
love
and
write
the
words
inspired
by
wonder
and
delight
of
tempests
wouldst
thou
sing
or
tell
of
battles
make
thyself
a
part
of
the
great
tumult
cling
to
the
tossed
wreck
with
terror
in
thy
heart
scale
with
the
assaulting
host
the
rampart
height
and
strike
and
struggle
in
the
thickest
fight
so
shalt
thou
frame
a
lay
that
haply
may
endure
from
age
to
age
and
they
who
read
shall
say
what
witchery
hangs
upon
this
poet
page
what
art
is
his
the
written
spells
to
find
that
sway
from
mood
to
mood
the
willing
mind
abraham

oh
slow

in
the
fear
of

didst
bear
the
sword
of
power
a
nation
trust
in
sorrow
by
thy
bier
we
stand
amid
the
awe
that
hushes
all
and
speak
the
anguish
of
a
land
that
shook
with
horror
at
thy
fall
thy
task
is
done
the

bear
thee
to

whose

monument
shall
be

of

its
bloody
close

the

o

can
you
see
by
the
dawn
early
light
what
so
proudly
we
hailed
at
the
twilight
last
gleaming
whose
broad
stripes
and
bright
stars
through
the
perilous
fight
the
ramparts
we
watched
were
so
gallantly
streaming
and
the
rocket
red
glare
the
bombs
bursting
in
air
gave
proof
through
the
night
that
our
flag
was
still
there
o
say
does
that
banner
yet
wave
the
land
of
the
free
and
the
home
of
the
brave
on
the
shore
dimly
seen
through
the

silence
reposes

now
it
catches

vauntingly
swore
that
the
havoc

battle
confusion
a

unfurled

tore
the

set
the

there

gorgeous
dyes
the

baldric
of

its
pure

white
with

of

from

gleaming
on
ere
yet
the
warm
and
wet
has
dimmed
the
glistening
bayonet
each
soldier
eye
shall
brightly
turn
to
where
thy
glories
burn
and
as
his
springing
steps
advance
catch
war
and
vengeance
from
the
glance
and
when
the
loud
heave
in
wild
wreaths
the
battle
shroud
and
gory
sabres
rise
and
fall
like
shoots
of
flame
on
midnight
pall
then
shall
thy
meteor
glances
glow
and
cowering
foes
shall
shrink
beneath
each
gallant
arm
that
strikes
below
that
lovely
messenger
of

sore
and
weary
hour
through
dreary
beds
of
tangled
fern
through
groves
of
nightshade
dark
and
dern
over
the
grass
and
through
the
brake
where
toils
the
ant
and
sleeps
the
snake
now
over
the
violet
azure
flush
he
skips
along
in
lightsome
mood
and
now
he
thrids
the
till
its
points
are
dyed
in
fairy
blood
he
has
leaped
the
bog
he
has
pierced
the
brier
he
has
swum
the
brook
and
waded
the
mire
till
his
spirits
sank
and
his
limbs
grew
weak
and
the
red
waxed
fainter
in
his
cheek
he
had
fallen
to
the
ground
outright
for
rugged
and
dim
was
his
onward
track
but
there
came
a
spotted
toad
in
sight
and
he
laughed
as
he
jumped
upon
her
back
he
bridled
her
mouth
with
a
silkweed
twist
he
lashed
her
sides
with
an
osier
thong
and
now
through
evening
dewy
mist
with
leap
and
spring
they
bound
along
till
the
mountain
magic
verge
is
past
and
the
beach
of
sand
is
reached
at
last
soft
and
pale
is
the
moony
beam
moveless
still
the
glassy
stream
the
wave
is
clear
the
beach
is
bright
with
snowy
shells
and
sparkling
stones
the
comes
in
ripples
light
in
murmurings
faint
and
distant
moans
and
ever
afar
in
the
silence
deep
is
heard
the
splash
of
the
sturgeon
leap
and
the
bend
of
his
graceful
bow
is
seen
a
glittering
arch
of
silver
sheen
spanning
the
wave
of
burnished
blue
and
dripping
with
gems
of
the
the
elfin
cast
a
glance
around
as
he
lighted
down
from
his
courser
toad
then
round
his
breast
his
wings
he
wound
and
close
to
the
river
brink
he
strode
he
sprang
on
a
rock
he
breathed
a
prayer
above
his
head
his
arms
he
threw
then
tossed
a
tiny
curve
in
air
and
headlong
plunged
in
the
waters
blue
up
sprung
the
spirits
of
the
waves
from
the
beds
in
their
coral
caves
with
armor
snatched
in
haste
they
speed
their
way
through
the
liquid
waste
some
are
rapidly
borne
along
on
the
mailed
shrimp
or
the
prickly
prong
some
on
the
leeches
glide
some
on
the
stony
ride
some
on
the
back
of
the
lancing
squab
some
on
the
sideling
and
some
on
the
jellied
quarl
that
flings
at
once
a
thousand
streamy
stings
they
cut
the
wave
with
the
living
oar
and
hurry
on
to
the
moonlight
shore
to
guard
their
realms
and
chase
away
the
footsteps
of
the
invading
fay
fearlessly
he
skims
along
his
hope
is
high
and
his
limbs
are
strong
he
spreads
his
arms
like
the
swallow
wing
and
throws
his
feet
with
a
fling
his
locks
of
gold
on
the
waters
shine
at
his
breast
the
tiny
rise
his
back
gleams
bright
above
the
brine
and
the
foam
behind
him
lies
but
the
are
gathering
near
to
check
his
course
along
the
tide
their
warriors
come
in
swift
career
and
hem
him
round
on
every
side
on
his
thigh
the
leech
has
fixed
his
hold
the
quad
long
arms
are
round
him
rolled
the
prickly
prong
has
pierced
his
skin
and
the
squab
has
thrown
his
javelin
the
gritty
star
has
rubbed
him
raw
and
the
crab
has
struck
with
his
giant
claw
he
howls
with
rage
and
he
shrieks
with
pain
he
strikes
around
but
his
blows
are
vain
hopeless
is
the
unequal
fight
fairy
naught
is
left
but
flight
he
turned
him
round
and
fled
amain
with
hurry
and
dash
to
the
beach
again
he
twisted
over
from
side
to
side
and
laid
his
cheek
to
the
cleaving
tide
the
strokes
of
his
plunging
arms
are
fleet
and
with
all
his
might
he
flings
his
feet
but
the
are
round
him
still
to
cross
his
path
and
work
him
ill
they
bade
the
wave
before
him
rise
they
flung
the
in
his
eyes
and
they
stunned
his
ears
with
the
with
the
porpoise
heave
and
the
croak
oh
but
a
weary
wight
was
he
when
he
reached
the
foot
of
the
tree
gashed
and
wounded
and
stiff
and
sore
he
laid
him
down
on
the
sandy
shore
he
blessed
the
force
of
the
charmed
line
and
he
banned
the
spite
for
he
saw
around
in
the
sweet
moonshine
their
little
wee
faces
above
the
brine
giggling
and
laughing
with
all
their
might
at
the
piteous
hap
of
the
fairy
wight
soon
he
gathered
the
balsam
dew
from
the
and
the
henbane
bud
over
each
wound
the
balm
he
drew
and
with
cobweb
lint
he
stanched
the
blood
the
mild
west
wind
was
soft
and
low
it
cooled
the
heat
of
his
burning
brow
and
he
felt
new
life
in
his
sinews
shoot
as
he
drank
the
juice
of
the
calamus
root
and
now
he
treads
the
fatal
shore
as
fresh
and
vigorous
as
before
wrapped
in
musing
stands
the
sprite
is
the
middle
wane
of
night
his
task
is
hard
his
way
is
far
but
he
must
do
his
errand
right
ere
dawning
mounts
her
beamy
car
and
rolls
her
chariot
wheels
of
light
and
vain
are
the
spells
of
he
must
work
with
a
human
hand
he
cast
a
saddened
look
around
but
he
felt
new
joy
his
bosom
swell
when
glittering
on
the
shadowed
ground
he
saw
a
purple
thither
he
ran
and
he
bent
him
low
he
heaved
at
the
stern
and
he
heaved
at
the
bow
and
he
pushed
her
over
the
yielding
sand
till
he
came
to
the
verge
of
the
haunted
land
she
was
as
lovely
a
as
ever
fairy
had
paddled
in
for
she
glowed
with
purple
paint
without
and
shone
with
silvery
pearl
within
a
sculler
notch
in
the
stern
he
made
an
oar
he
shaped
of
the
then
sprung
to
his
seat
with
a
lightsome
leap
and
launched
afar
on
the
calm
blue
deep
the
imps
of
the
river
yell
and
rave
they
had
no
power
above
the
wave
but
they
heaved
the
billow
before
the
prow
and
they
dashed
the
surge
against
her
side
and
they
struck
her
keel
with
jerk
and
blow
till
the
gunwale
bent
to
the
rocking
tide
she
wimpled
about
to
the
pale
moonbeam
like
a
feather
that
floats
on
a
stream
and
momently
athwart
her
track
the
quad
upreared
his
island
back
and
the
fluttering
scallop
behind
would
float
and
patter
the
water
about
the
boat
but
he
bailed
her
out
with
his
and
he
kept
her
trimmed
with
a
wary
tread
while
on
every
side
like
lightning
fell
the
heavy
strokes
of
his
onward
still
he
held
his
way
till
he
came
where
the
column
of
moonshine
lay
and
saw
beneath
the
surface
dim
the
sturgeon
slowly
swim
around
him
were
the
goblin
train
but
he
sculled
with
all
his
might
and
main
and
followed
wherever
the
sturgeon
led
till
he
saw
him
upward
point
his
head
mien
he
dropped
his
and
held
his
up
to
catch
the
drop
in
its
crimson
cup
with
sweeping
tail
and
quivering
fin
through
the
wave
the
sturgeon
flew
and
like
the
javelin
he
sprung
above
the
waters
blue
instant
as
the
light
he
plunged
him
in
the
deep
again
but
left
an
arch
of
silver
bright
the
rainbow
of
the
moony
main
it
was
a
strange
and
lovely
sight
to
see
the
puny
goblin
there
he
seemed
an
angel
form
of
light
with
azure
wing
and
sunny
hair
throned
on
a
cloud
of
purple
fair
circled
with
blue
and
edged
with
white
and
sitting
at
the
fall
of
even
beneath
the
bow
of
summer
heaven
a
moment
and
its
lustre
fell
but
ere
it
met
the
billow
blue
he
caught
within
his
crimson
bell
a
droplet
of
its
sparkling
dew
joy
to
thee
fay
thy
task
is
done
thy
wings
are
pure
for
the
gem
is
won
cheerly
ply
thy
dripping
oar
and
haste
away
to
the
elfin
shore
he
turns
and
to
on
either
side
the
ripples
on
his
path
divide
and
the
track
which
his
boat
must
pass
is
smooth
as
a
sheet
of
polished
glass
around
their
limbs
the
lave
with
snowy
arms
half
swelling
out
while
on
the
glossed
and
gleamy
wave
their
ringlets
loosely
float
they
swim
around
with
smile
and
song
they
press
the
bark
with
pearly
hand
and
gently
urge
her
course
along
toward
the
beach
of
speckled
sand
and
as
he
lightly
leaped
to
land
they
bade
adieu
with
nod
and
bow
then
gaily
kissed
each
little
hand
and
dropped
in
the
crystal
deep
below
a
moment
stayed
the
fairy
there
he
kissed
the
beach
and
breathed
a
prayer
then
spread
his
wings
of
gilded
blue
and
on
to
the
elfin
court
he
flew
as
ever
ye
saw
a
bubble
rise
and
shine
with
a
thousand
changing
dyes
till
lessening
far
through
ether
driven
it
mingles
with
the
hues
of
heaven
as
at
the
glimpse
of
morning
pale
the
spreads
his
silken
sail
and
gleams
with
bleedings
soft
and
bright
till
lost
in
the
shades
of
fading
night
so
rose
from
earth
the
lovely
fay
so
vanished
far
in
heaven
away
halleck
marco
bozzaris
at
midnight
in
his
guarded
tent
the
turk
was
dreaming
of
the
hour
when
greece
her
knee
in
suppliance
bent
should
tremble
at
his
power
in
dreams
through
camp
and
court
he
bore
the
trophies
of
a
conqueror
in
dreams
his
song
of
triumph
heard
then
wore
his
monarch
signet
ring
then
pressed
that
monarch
throne
a
king
as
wild
his
thoughts
and
gay
of
wing
as
eden
garden
bird
at
midnight
in
the
forest
shades
bozzaris
ranged
his
suliote
band
true
as
the
steel
of
their
tried
blades
heroes
in
heart
and
hand
there
had
the
persian
thousands
stood
there
had
the
glad
earth
drunk
their
blood
on
old
plataea
day
and
now
there
breathed
that
haunted
air
the
sons
of
sires
who
conquered
there
with
arm
to
strike
and
soul
to
dare
as
quick
as
far
as
they
an
hour
passed
on
the
turk
awoke
that
bright
dream
was
his
last
he
woke
to
hear
his
sentries
shriek
to
arms
they
come
the
greek
the
greek
he
woke
to
die
midst
flame
and
smoke
and
shout
and
groan
and
and
falling
thick
and
fast
as
lightnings
from
the
and
heard
with
voice
as
trumpet
loud
bozzaris
cheer
his
band
strike
till
the
last
armed
foe
expires
strike
for
your
altars
and
your
fires
strike
for
the
green
graves
of
your
sires
god
and
your
native
land
they
fought
like
brave
men
long
and
well
they
piled
that
ground
with
moslem
slain
they
conquered
but
bozzaris
fell
bleeding
at
every
vein
his
few
surviving
comrades
saw
his
smile
when
rang
their
proud
hurrah
and
the
red
field
was
won
then
saw
in
death
his
eyelids
close
calmly
as
to
a
night
repose
like
flowers
at
set
of
sun
come
to
the
bridal
chamber

come
to
the
mother
when
she
feels
for
the
first
time
her
breath
come
when
the
blessed
seals
that
close
the
pestilence
are
broke
and
crowded
cities
wail
its
stroke
come
in
consumption
ghastly
form
the
earthquake
shock
the
ocean
storm
come
when
the
heart
beats
high
and
warm
with
and
dance
and
wine
and
thou
art
terrible
the
tear
the
groan
the
knell
the
pall
the
bier
and
all
we
know
or
dream
or
fear
of
agony
are
thine
but
to
the
hero
when
his
sword
has
won
the
battle
for
the
free
thy
voice
sounds
like
a
prophet
word
and
in
its
hollow
tones
are
heard
the
thanks
of
millions
yet
to

is
wrought
come

then
thy

thy

she

no
for

nor
bade
the
dark
hearse
wave
its
plume
like
torn
branch
from
death
leafless
tree
in
sorrow
pomp
and
pageantry
the
heartless
luxury
of
the
tomb
but
she
remembers
thee
as
one
long
loved
and
for
a
season
gone
for
thee
her

she
rings
the

bells
of
thee
her

first
lisping
tells

her
evening
prayer
is
said
at
and
her
soldier
closing
with
the
foe
gives
for
thy
sake
a
deadlier
blow
his
plighted
maiden
when
she
fears
for
him
the
joy
of
her
young
years
thinks
of
thy
fate
and
checks
her
tears
and
she
the
mother
of
thy
boys
though
in
her
eye
and
faded
cheek
is
read
the
grief
she
will
not
speak
the
memory
of
her
buried
joys
and
even
she
who
gave
thee
birth
will
by
their
hearth
talk
of
thy
doom
without
a
sigh
for
thou
art
freedom
now
and
fame
one
of
the
few
the

above
thee
friend
of
my
better
days
none
knew
thee
but
to
love
thee
nor
named
thee
but
to
praise
tears
fell
when
thou
went
dying
from
eyes
unused
to
weep
and
long
where
thou
art
lying
will
tears
the
cold
turf
steep
when
hearts
whose
truth
was
proven
like
throe
are
laid
in
earth
there
should
a
wreath
be
woven
to
tell
the
world
their
worth

woke
each
morrow
to
clasp
thy
hand
in
mine
who
shared
thy
joy

weal
and
woe

thine

mine
to

it
around
thy

i
in

essayed
it
and
i
feel
i
can
not
now
while
memory
bids
me
weep
thee
nor

the

israel
and
the
giddy
stars
so
legends
tell
ceasing
their
hymns
attend
the
spell
of
his
voice
all
mute
tottering
above
in
her
highest
noon
the
enamoured
moon
blushes
with
love
while
to
listen
the
red
levin
with
the
rapid
pleiads
even
which
were
seven
pauses
in
heaven
and
they
say
the
starry
choir
and
the
other
listening
things
that
israeli
fire
is
owing
to
that
lyre
by
which
he
sits
and
sings
the
trembling
living
wire
of
those
unusual
strings
but
the
skies
that
angel
trod
where
deep
thoughts
are
a
duty
where
love
a
god
where
the
houri
glances
are
imbued
with
all
the
beauty
which
we
worship
in
a
star
therefore
thou
art
not
wrong
israfeli
who
despisest
an
unimpassioned
song
to
thee
the
laurels
belong
best
bard
because
the
wisest
merrily
live
and
long
the
ecstasies
above
with
thy
burning
measures
suit
thy
grief
thy
joy
thy
hate
thy
love
with
the
fervour
of
thy
lute
well
may
the
stars
be
mute
yes
heaven
is
but
this
is
a
world
of
sweets
and
sours
our
flowers
are
merely
flowers
and
the
shadow
of
thy
perfect
bliss
is
the
sunshine
of
ours
if
i
could
dwell
where
israfel
hath
dwelt
and
he
where
i
he
might
not
sing
so
wildly
well
a
mortal
melody
while
a
bolder
note
than
this
might
swell
from
my
lyre
within
the
sky
lenore
ah
broken
is
the
golden
bowl
the
spirit
flown
forever
let
the
bell
toll
a
saintly
soul
floats
on
the
stygian
river
and
guy
de
vere
halt
thou
no
tear
weep
now
or
never
more
see
on
yon
drear
and
rigid
bier
low
lies
thy
love
lenore
come
let
the
burial
rite
be
read
the
funeral
song
be
sung
an
anthem
for
the
queenliest
dead
that
ever
died
so
young
a
dirge
for
her
the
doubly
dead
in
that
she
died
so
young
wretches
ye
loved
her
for
her
wealth
and
hated
her
for
her
pride
and
when
she
fell
in
feeble
health
ye
blessed
her
that
she
died
how
shall
the
ritual
then
be
read
the
requiem
how
be
sung
by
you
by
yours
the
evil
eye
by
yours
the
slanderous
tongue
that
did
to
death
the
innocence
that
died
and
died
so
young
peccavimus
but
rave
not
thus
and
let
a
sabbath
song
go
up
to
god
so
solemnly
the
dead
may
feel
no
wrong
the
sweet
lenore
hath
gone
before
with
hope
that
flew
beside
leaving
thee
wild
for
the
dear
child
that
should
have
been
thy
bride
for
her
the
fair
and
debonair
that
now
so
lowly
lies
the
life
upon
her
yellow
hair
but
not
within
her
eyes
the
life
still
there
upon
her
hair
the
death
upon
her
eyes
avaunt
avaunt
from
fiends
below
the
indignant
ghost
is
riven
from
hell
unto
a
high
estate
far
up
within
the
heaven
from
grief
and
groan
to
a
golden
throne
beside
the
king
of
heaven
let
no
bell
toll
then
lest
her
soul
amid
its
hallowed
mirth
should
catch
the
note
as
it
doth
float
up
from
the
damned
earth
and
i
my
heart
is
light
no
dirge
will
i
upraise
but
waft
the
angel
on
her
flight
with
a
paean
of
old
days
the
coliseum
type
of
the
antique
rome
rich
reliquary
of
lofty
contemplation
left
to
time
by
bunted
centuries
of
pomp
and
power
at
length
at
length
after
so
many
days
of
weary
pilgrimage
and
burning
thirst
thirst
for
the
springs
of
lore
that
in
thee
lie
i
kneel
an
altered
and
an
humble
man
amid
thy
shadows
and
so
drink
within
my
very
soul
thy
grandeur
gloom
and
glory
vastness
and
age
and
memories
of
eld
silence
and
desolation
and
dim
night
i
feel
ye
now
i
feel
ye
in
your
strength
o
spells
more
sure
than
judaean
king
taught
in
the
gardens
of
gethsemane
o
charms
more
potent
than
the
rapt
chaldee
ever
drew
down
from
out
the
quiet
stars
here
where
a
hero
fell
a
column
falls
here
where
the
mimic
eagle
glared
in
gold
a
midnight
vigil
holds
the
swarthy
bat
here
where
the
dames
of
rome
their
gilded
hair
waved
to
the
wind
now
wave
the
reed
and
thistle
here
where
on
golden
throne
the
monarch
lolled
glides
unto
his
marble
home
lit
by
the
wan
light
of
the
horned
moon
the
swift
and
silent
lizard
of
the
stones
but
stay
these
walls
these
arcades
these
mouldering
plinths
these
sad
and
blackened
shafts
these
vague
entablatures
this
crumbling
frieze
these
shattered
cornices
this
wreck
this
ruin
these
stones
alas
these
gray
stones
are
they
all
all
of
the
famed
and
the
colossal
left
by
the
corrosive
hours
to
fate
and
me
not
all
the
echoes
answer
me
not
all
prophetic
sounds
and
loud
arise
forever
from
us
and
from
all
ruin
unto
the
wise
as
melody
from
memnon
to
the
sun
we
rule
the
hearts
of
mightiest
men
we
rule
with
a
despotic
sway
all
giant
minds
we
are
not
impotent
we
pallid
stones
not
all
our
power
is
gone
not
all
our
fame
not
all
the
magic
of
our
high
renown
not
all
the
wonder
that
encircles
us
not
all
the
mysteries
that
in
us
lie
not
all
the
memories
that
hang
upon
and
cling
around
about
us
as
a
garment
clothing
us
in
a
robe
of
more
than
glory
the
haunted
palace
in
the
greenest
of
our
valleys
by
good
angels
tenanted
once
a
fair
and
stately
palace
radiant
palace
reared
its
head
in
the
monarch
thought
dominion
it
stood
there
never
seraph
spread
a
pinion
over
fabric
half
so
fair
banners
yellow
glorious
golden
on
its
roof
did
float
and
flow
this
all
this
was
in
the
olden
time
long
ago
and
every
gentle
air
that
dallied
in
that
sweet
day
along
the
ramparts
plumed
and
pallid
a
winged
odor
went
away
wanderers
in
that
happy
valley
through
two
luminous
windows
saw
spirits
moving
musically
to
a
lute
law
round
about
a
throne
where
sitting
porphyrogene
in
state
his
glory
well
befitting
the
ruler
of
the
realm
was
seen
and
all
with
pearl
and
ruby
glowing
was
the
fair
palace
door
through
which
came
flowing
flowing
flowing
and
sparkling
evermore
a
troop
of
echoes
whose
sweet
duty
was
but
to
sing
in
voices
of
surpassing
beauty
the
wit
and
wisdom
of
their
king
but
evil
things
in
robes
of
sorrow
assailed
the
monarch
high
estate
ah
let
us
mourn
for
never
morrow
shall
dawn
upon
him
desolate
and
round
about
his
home
the
glory
that
blushed
and
bloomed
is
but
a
story
of
the
old
time
entombed
and
travellers
now
within
that
valley
through
the
windows
see
vast
forms
that
move
fantastically
to
a
discordant
melody
while
like
a
ghastly
rapid
river
through
the
pale
door
a
hideous
throng
rush
out
forever
and
laugh
but
smile
no
more
to
one
in
paradise
thou
wast
all
that
to
me
love
for
which
my
soul
did
pine
a
green
isle
in
the
sea
love
a
fountain
and
a
shrine
all
wreathed
with
fairy
fruits
and
flowers
and
all
the
flowers
were
mine
ah
dream
too
bright
to
last
ah
starry
hope
that
didst
arise
but
to
be
overcast
a
voice
from
out
the
future
cries
on
on
but
the
past
dim
gulf
my
spirit
hovering
lies
mute
motionless
aghast
for
alas
alas
with
me
the
light
of
life
is
no
more
no
more
no
more
such
language
holds
the
solemn
sea
to
the
sands
upon
the
shore
shall
bloom
the
tree
or
the
stricken
eagle
soar
and
all
my
days
are
trances
and
all
my
nightly
dreams
are
where
thy
grey
eye
glances
and
where
thy
footstep
gleams
in
what
ethereal
dances
by
what
eternal
streams
a
song
i
dwelt
alone
in
a
world
of
moan
and
my
soul
was
a
stagnant
tide
till
the
fair
and
gentle
eulalie
became
my
blushing
bride
till
the
young
eulalie
became
my
smiling
bride
ah
less
less
bright
the
stars
of
the
night
than
the
eyes
of
the
radiant
girl
and
never
a
flake
that
the
vapor
can
make
with
the
of
purple
and
pearl
can
vie
with
the
modest
eulalie
most
unregarded
curl
can
compare
with
the
eulalie
most
humble
and
careless
curl
now
doubt
now
pain
come
never
again
for
her
soul
gives
me
sigh
for
sigh
and
all
day
long
shines
bright
and
strong
astarte
within
the
sky
while
ever
to
her
dear
eulalie
upturns
her
matron
eye
while
ever
to
her
young
eulalie
upturns
her
violet
eye
the
raven
once
upon
a
midnight
dreary
while
i
pondered
weak
and
weary
over
many
a
quaint
and
curious
volume
of
forgotten
lore
while
i
nodded
nearly
napping
suddenly
there
came
a
tapping
as
of
some
one
gently
rapping
rapping
at
my
chamber
door
is
some
visitor
i
muttered
tapping
at
my
chamber
door
only
this
and
nothing
more
ah
distinctly
i
remember
it
was
in
the
bleak
december
and
each
separate
dying
ember
wrought
its
ghost
upon
the
floor
eagerly
i
wished
the
morrow
vainly
i
had
sought
to
borrow
from
my
books
surcease
of
sorrow
sorrow
for
the
lost
lenore
for
the
rare
and
radiant
maiden
whom
the
angels
name
lenore
nameless
here
for
evermore
and
the
silken
sad
uncertain
rustling
of
each
purple
curtain
thrilled
me
filled
me
with
fantastic
terrors
never
felt
before
so
that
now
to
still
the
beating
of
my
heart
i
stood
repeating
is
some
visitor
entreating
entrance
at
my
chamber
door
some
late
visitor
entreating
entrance
at
my
chamber
door
this
it
is
and
nothing
more
presently
my
soul
grew
stronger
hesitating
then
no
longer
sir
said
i
or
madam
truly
your
forgiveness
i
implore
but
the
fact
is
i
was
napping
and
so
gently
you
came
rapping
and
so
faintly
you
came
tapping
tapping
at
my
chamber
door
that
i
scarce
was
sure
i
heard
you
here
i
opened
wide
the
door
darkness
there
and
nothing
more
deep
into
that
darkness
peering
long
i
stood
there
wondering
fearing
doubting
dreaming
dreams
no
mortal
ever
dared
to
dream
before
but
the
silence
was
unbroken
and
the
stillness
gave
no
token
and
the
only
word
there
spoken
was
the
whispered
word
lenore
this
i
whispered
and
an
echo
murmured
back
the
word
lenore
merely
this
and
nothing
more
back
into
the
chamber
turning
all
my
soul
within
me
burning
soon
again
i
heard
a
tapping
somewhat
louder
than
before
surely
said
i
surely
that
is
something
at
my
window
lattice
let
me
see
then
what
thereat
is
and
this
mystery
explore
let
my
heart
be
still
a
moment
and
this
mystery
explore
is
the
wind
and
nothing
more
open
here
i
flung
the
shutter
when
with
many
a
flirt
and
flutter
in
there
stepped
a
stately
raven
of
the
saintly
days
of
yore
not
the
least
obeisance
made
he
not
a
minute
stopped
or
stayed
he
but
with
mien
of
lord
or
lady
perched
above
my
chamber
door
perched
upon
a
bust
of
pallas
just
above
my
chamber
door
perched
and
sat
and
nothing
more
then
this
ebony
bird
beguiling
my
sad
fancy
into
smiling
by
the
grave
and
stern
decorum
of
the
countenance
it
wore
though
thy
crest
be
shorn
and
shaven
thou
i
said
art
sure
no
craven
ghastly
grim
and
ancient
raven
wandering
from
the
nightly
shore
tell
me
what
thy
lordly
name
is
on
the
night
plutonian
shore
quoth
the
raven
nevermore
much
i
marvelled
this
ungainly
fowl
to
hear
discourse
so
plainly
though
its
answer
little
meaning
little
relevancy
bore
for
we
can
not
help
agreeing
that
no
living
human
being
ever
yet
was
blessed
with
seeing
bird
above
his
chamber
door
bird
or
beast
upon
the
sculptured
bust
above
his
chamber
door
with
such
name
as
nevermore
but
the
raven
sitting
lonely
on
the
placid
bust
spoke
only
that
one
word
as
if
his
soul
in
that
one
word
he
did
outpour
nothing
farther
then
he
uttered
not
a
feather
then
he
fluttered
till
i
scarcely
more
than
muttered
other
friends
have
flown
before
on
the
morrow
he
will
leave
me
as
my
hopes
have
flown
before
then
the
bird
said
nevermore
startled
at
the
stillness
broken
by
reply
so
aptly
spoken
doubtless
said
i
what
it
utters
is
its
only
stock
and
store
caught
from
some
unhappy
master
whom
unmerciful
disaster
followed
fast
and
followed
faster
till
his
songs
one
burden
bore
till
the
dirges
of
his
hope
that
melancholy
burden
bore
of
nevermore
but
the
raven
still
beguiling
all
my
fancy
into
smiling
straight
i
wheeled
a
cushioned
seat
in
front
of
bird
and
bust
and
door
then
upon
the
velvet
sinking
i
betook
myself
to
linking
fancy
unto
fancy
thinking
what
this
ominous
bird
of
yore
what
this
grim
ungainly
ghastly
gaunt
and
ominous
bird
of
yore
meant
in
croaking
nevermore
thus
i
sat
engaged
in
guessing
but
no
syllable
expressing
to
the
fowl
whose
fiery
eyes
now
burned
into
my
bosom
core
this
and
more
i
sat
divining
with
my
head
at
ease
reclining
on
the
cushion
velvet
lining
that
the
gloated
but
whose
velvet
violet
lining
with
the
gloating
she
shall
press
ah
nevermore
then
methought
the
air
grew
denser
perfumed
from
an
unseen
censer
swung
by
seraphim
whose
tinkled
on
the
tufted
floor
wretch
i
cried
thy
god
hath
lent
thee
by
these
angels
he
hath
sent
thee
respite
respite
and
nepenthe
from
thy
memories
of
lenore
quaff
oh
quaff
this
kind
nepenthe
and
forget
this
lost
lenore
quoth
the
raven
nevermore
prophet
said
i
thing
of
evil
prophet
still
if
bird
or
devil
whether
tempter
sent
or
whether
tempest
tossed
thee
here
ashore
desolate
yet
all
undaunted
on
this
desert
land
enchanted
on
this
home
by
horror
haunted
tell
me
truly
i
implore
is
there
is
there
balm
in
gilead
tell
me
tell
me
i
implore
quoth
the
raven

said
i
thing
of
evil
prophet
still
if
bird
or
devil
by
that
heaven
that
bends
above
us
by
that
god
we
both
adore
tell
this
soul
with
sorrow
laden
if
within
the
distant
aidenn
it
shall
clasp
a
sainted
maiden
whom
the
angels
name
lenore
clasp
a
rare
and
radiant
maiden
whom
the
angels

lenore
quoth
the
raven
nevermore
be
that
word
our
sign
of
parting
bird
or
fiend
i
shrieked
upstarting
get
thee
back
into
the
tempest
and
the
night
plutonian
shore
leave
no
black
plume
as
a
token
of
that
lie
thy
soul
hath
spoken
leave
my
loneliness
unbroken
quit
the
bust
above
my
door
take
thy
beak
from
out
my
heart
and
take
thy
form
from
off
my
door
quoth
the
raven
nevermore
and
the
raven
never
flitting
still
is
sitting
still
is
sitting
on
the
pallid
bust
of
pallas
dust
above
my
chamber
door
and
his
eyes
have
all
the
seeming
of
a
demon
that
is
dreaming
and
the
him
streaming
throws
his
shadow
on
the
floor
and
my
soul
from
out
that
shadow
that
lies
floating
on
the
floor
shall
be
lifted
nevermore
to
helen
i
saw
thee
once
once
only
years
ago
i
must
not
say
how
many
but
not
many
it
was
a
july
midnight
and
from
out
a
moon
that
like
thine
own
soul
soaring
sought
a
precipitate
pathway
up
through
heaven
there
fell
a
veil
of
light
with
quietude
and
sultriness
and
slumber
upon
the
upturn
faces
of
a
thousand
roses
that
grew
in
an
enchanted
garden
where
no
wind
dared
to
stir
unless
on
tiptoe
fell
on
the
upturn
faces
of
these
roses
that
gave
out
in
return
for
the
their
odorous
souls
in
an
ecstatic
death
fell
on
the
upturn
faces
of
these
roses
that
smiled
and
died
in
this
parterre
enchanted
by
thee
and
by
the
poetry
of
thy
presence
clad
all
in
white
upon
a
violet
bank
i
saw
thee
half
reclining
while
the
moon
fell
on
the
upturn
faces
of
the
roses
and
on
throe
own
upturn
alas
in
sorrow
was
it
not
fate
that
on
this
july
midnight
was
it
not
fate
whose
name
is
also
sorrow
that
bade
me
pause
before
that
to
breathe
the
incense
of
those
slumbering
roses
no
footstep
stirred
the
hated
world
all
slept
save
only
thee
and
me
oh
heaven
oh
god
how
my
heart
beats
in
coupling
those
two
words
save
only
thee
and
me
i
paused
i
looked
and
in
an
instant
all
things
disappeared
ah
bear
in
mind
this
garden
was
enchanted
the
pearly
lustre
of
the
moon
went
out
the
mossy
banks
and
the
meandering
paths
the
happy
flowers
and
the
repining
trees
were
seen
no
more
the
very
roses
odors
died
in
the
arms
of
the
adoring
airs
all
all
expired
save
thee
save
less
than
thou
save
only
the
divine
light
in
throe
eyes
save
but
the
soul
in
throe
uplifted
eyes
i
saw
but
them
they
were
the
world
to
me
i
saw
but
them
saw
only
them
for
hours
saw
only
there
until
the
moon
went
down
what
wild
seemed
to
lie
enwritten
upon
those
crystalline
celestial
spheres
how
dark
a
wo
yet
how
sublime
a
hope
how
silently
serene
a
sea
of
pride
how
daring
an
ambition
yet
how
deep
how
fathomless
a
capacity
for
love
but
now
at
length
dear
dian
sank
from
sight
into
a
western
couch
of
and
thou
a
ghost
amid
the
entombing
trees
didst
glide
away
only
thine
eyes
remained
they
would
not
go
they
never
yet
have
gone
lighting
my
lonely
pathway
home
that
night
they
have
not
left
me
as
my
hopes
have
since
they
follow
me
they
lead
me
through
the
years
they
are
my
ministers
yet
i
their
slave
their
office
is
to
illumine
and
enkindle
my
duty
to
be
saved
by
their
bright
light
and
purified
in
their
electric
fire
and
sanctified
in
their
elysian
fire
they
fill
my
soul
with
beauty
which
is
hope
and
are
far
up
in
heaven
the
stars
i
kneel
to
in
the
sad
silent
watches
of
my
night
while
even
in
the
meridian
glare
of
day
i
see
them
still
two
sweetly
scintillant
venuses
unextinguished
by
the
sun
annabel
lee
it
was
many
and
many
a
year
ago
in
a
kingdom
by
the
sea
that
a
maiden
there
lived
whom
you
may
know
by
the
name
of
annabel
lee
and
this
maiden
she
lived
with
no
other
thought
than
to
love
and
be
loved
by
me
i
was
a
child
and
she
was
a
child
in
this
kingdom
by
the
sea
but
we
loved
with
a
love
that
was
more
than
love
i
and
my
annabel
lee
with
a
love
that
the
winged
seraphs
of
heaven
coveted
her
and
me
and
this
was
the
reason
that
long
ago
in
this
kingdom
by
the
sea
a
wind
blew
out
of
a
cloud
chilling
my
beautiful
annabel
lee
so
that
her
highborn
kinsmen
came
and
bore
her
away
from
me
to
shut
her
up
in
a
sepulchre
in
this
kingdom
by
the
sea
the
angels
not
half
so
happy
in
heaven
went
envying
her
and
me
yes
that
was
the
reason
as
all
men
know
in
this
kingdom
by
the
sea
that
the
wind
came
out
of
the
cloud
by
night
chilling
and
killing
my
annabel
lee
but
our
love
it
was
stronger
by
far
than
the
love
of
those
who
were
older
than
we
of
many
far
wiser
than
we
and
neither
the
angels
in
heaven
above
nor
the
demons
down
under
the
sea
can
ever
dissever
my
soul
from
the
soul
of
the
beautiful
annabel
lee
for
the
moon
never
beams
without
bringing
me
dreams
of
the
beautiful
annabel
lee
and
the
stars
never
rise
but
i
feel
the
bright
eyes
of
the
beautiful
annabel
lee
and
so
all
the
i
lie
down
by
the
side
of
my
darling
my
darling
my
life
and
my
bride
in
the
sepulchre
there
by
the
sea
in
her
tomb
by
the
sounding
sea
the
bells
hear
the
sledges
with
the
bells
silver
bells
what
a
world
of
merriment
their
melody
foretells
how
they
tinkle
tinkle
tinkle
in
the
icy
air
of
night
while
the
stars
that
oversprinkle
all
the
heavens
seem
to
twinkle
with
a
crystalline
delight
keeping
time
time
time
in
a
sort
of
runic
rhyme
to
the
tintinnabulation
that
so
musically
wells
from
the
bells

bells
bells

from
the
jingling
and
the
tinkling
of
the

the
mellow
wedding

golden
bells
what
a
world
of
happiness
their
harmony
foretell
through
the
balmy
air
of
night
how
they
ring
out
their
delight
from
the
notes
and
all
in
tune
what
a
liquid
ditty
floats
to
the
that
listens
while
she
gloats
on
the
moon
oh
from
out
the
sounding
cells
what
a
gush
of
euphony
voluminously
wells
how
it
swells
how
it
dwells
on
the
future
how
it
tells
of
the
rapture
that
impels
to
the
swinging
and
the
ringing
of
the
bells
bells
bells
of
the

to
the
rhyming
and
the
chiming
of
the

hear
the
loud
alarum
bells
brazen
bells
what
a
tale
of
terror
now
their
turbulency
tells
in
the
startled
ear
of
night
how
they
scream
out
their
affright
too
much
horrified
to
speak
they
can
only
shriek
shriek
out
of
tune
in
a
clamorous
appealing
to
the
mercy
of
the
fire
in
a
mad
expostulation
with
the
deaf
and
frantic
fire
leaping
higher
higher
higher
with
a
desperate
desire
and
a
resolute
endeavor
now
now
to
sit
or
never
by
the
side
of
the
moon
oh
the
bells
bells
bells
what
a
tale
their
terror
tells
of
despair
how
they
clang
and
clash
and
roar
what
a
horror
they
outpour
on
the
bosom
of
the
palpitating
air
yet
the
ear
it
fully
knows
by
the
twanging
and
the
clanging
how
the
danger
ebbs
and
flows
yet
the
ear
distinctly
tells
in
the
jangling
and
the
wrangling
how
the
danger
sinks
and
swells
by
the
sinking
or
the
swelling
in
the
anger
of
the
bells
of
the
bells
of

in

what
a
world
of
solemn
thought
their
monody
compels
in
the
silence
of
the
night
how
we
shiver
with
affright
at
the
melancholy
menace
of
their
tone
for
every
sound
that
floats
from
the
rust
within
their
throats
is
a
groan
and
the
people
ah
the
people
they
that
dwell
up
in
the
steeple
all
alone
and
who
tolling
tolling
tolling
in
that
muffled
monotone
feel
a
glory
in
so
rolling
on
the
human
heart
a
stone
they
are
neither

they
are
neither
brute
nor

they
are
ghouls
and
their
king
it
is
who
tolls
and

rolls
rolls

rolls
a
paean
from
the

and
his
merry
bosom
swells
with
the
paean
of

all
fringed
with

i

with

thou

then
from
those
cavernous
eyes
pale
flashes
seemed
to
rise
as
when
the
northern
skies
gleam
in

and
like
the
water

dread
a

curse
for
this
i
sought
thee
far
in
the
northern
land
by
the
wild
baltic
strand
i
with
my
childish
hand
tamed
the
and
with
my
skates
skimmed
the
sound
that
the
poor
whimpering
hound
trembled
to
walk
on
oft
to
his
frozen
lair
tracked
i
the
grisly
bear
while
from
my
path
the
hare
fled
like
a
shadow
oft
through
the
forest
dark
followed
the
bark
until
the
soaring
lark
sang
from
the
meadow
but
when
i
older
grew
joining
a
corsair
crew
the
dark
sea
i
flew
with
the
marauders
wild
was
the
life
we
led
many
the
souls
that
sped
many
the
hearts
that
bled
by
our
stern
orders
many
a
wore
the
long
winter
out
often
our
midnight
shout
set
the
cocks
crowing
as
we
the
berserk
tale
measured
in
cups
of
ale
draining
the
oaken
pail
filled
to
once
as
i
told
in
glee
tales
of
the
stormy
sea
soft
eyes
did
gaze
on
me
burning
yet
tender
and
as
the
white
stars
shine
on
the
dark
norway
pine
on
that
dark
heart
of
mine
fell
their
soft
splendor
i
wooed
the
maid
yielding
yet
half
afraid
and
in
the
forest
shade
our
vows
were
plighted
under
its
loosened
vest
fluttered
her
little
breast
like
birds
within
their
nest
by
the
hawk
frighted
bright
in
her
father
hall
shields
gleamed
upon
the
wall
loud
sang
the
minstrels
all
chaunting
his
glory
when
of
old
hildebrand
i
asked
his
daughter
hand
mute
did
the
minstrels
stand
to
hear
my
story
while
the
brown
ale
he
quaffed
loud
then
the
champion
laughed
and
as
the
waft
the
brightly
so
the
loud
laugh
of
scorn
out
of
those
lips
unshorn
from
the
deep
blew
the
foam
lightly
she
was
a
prince
child
i
but
a
viking
wild
and
though
she
blushed
and
smiled
i
was
discarded
should
not
the
dove
so
white
follow
the
flight
why
did
they
leave
that
night
her
nest
unguarded
scarce
had
i
put
to
sea
bearing
the
maid
with
me
fairest
of
all
was
she
among
the
norsemen
when
on
the
white
waving
his
armed
hand
saw
we
old
hildebrand
with
twenty
horsemen
then
launched
they
to
the
blast
bent
like
a
reed
each
mast
yet
we
were
gaining
fast
when
the
wind
failed
us
and
with
a
sudden
flaw
come
round
the
gusty
skaw
so
that
our
foe
we
saw
laugh
as
he
hailed
us
and
as
to
catch
the
gale
round
veered
the
flapping
sail
death
was
the
helmsman
hail
death
without
quarter
with
iron
keel
struck
we
her
ribs
of
steel
down
her
black
hulk
did
reel
through
the
black
water
as
with
his
wings
aslant
sails
the
fierce
cormorant
seeking
some
rocky
haunt
with
his
prey
laden
so
toward
the
open
main
beating
to
sea
again
through
the
wild
hurricane
bore
i
the
maiden
three
weeks
we
westward
bore
and
when
the
storm
was
we
saw
the
shore
stretching
to
there
for
my
lady
bower
built
i
the
lofty
tower
which
to
this
very
hour
stands
looking
there
lived
we
many
years
time
dried
the
maiden
tears
she
had
forgot
her
fears
she
was
a
mother
death
closed
her
mild
blue
eyes
under
that
tower
she
lies
shall
the
sun
arise
on
such
another
still
grew
my
bosom
then
still
as
a
stagnant
fen
hateful
to
me
were
men
the
hateful
in
the
vast
forest
here
clad
in
my
warlike
gear
fell
i
upon
my
spear
o
death
was
grateful
thus
seamed
with
many
scars
bursting
these
prison
bars
up
to
its
native
stars
my
soul
ascended
there
from
the
flowing
bowl
deep
drinks
the
warrior
soul
skoal
to
the
northland
skoal
thus
the
tale
ended
the
wreck
of
the
hesperus
it
was
the
schooner
hesperus
that
sailed
the
wintry
sea
and
the
skipper
had
taken
his
little
daughter
to
bear
him
company
blue
were
her
eyes
as
the
her
cheeks
like
the
dawn
of
day
and
her
bosom
white
as
the
hawthorn
buds
that
ope
in
the
month
of
may
the
skipper
he
stood
beside
the
helm
his
pipe
was
in
his
mouth
and
he
watched
how
the
veering
flaw
did
blow
the
smoke
now
west
now
south
then
up
and
spake
an
old
sailor
had
sailed
the
spanish
main
i
pray
thee
put
into
yonder
port
for
i
fear
a
hurricane
last
night
the
moon
had
a
golden
ring
and
no
moon
we
see
the
skipper
he
blew
a
whiff
from
his
pipe
and
a
scornful
laugh
laughed
he
colder
and
louder
blew
the
wind
a
gale
from
the
northeast
the
snow
fell
hissing
in
the
brine
and
the
billows
frothed
like
yeast
down
came
the
storm
and
smote
amain
the
vessel
in
its
strength
she
shuddered
and
paused
like
a
frighted
steed
then
leaped
her
cable
length
come
hither
come
hither
my
little
daughter
and
do
not
tremble
so
for
i
can
weather
the
roughest
gale
that

a

stiff

stark
with
his
face
turned
to
the
skies
the
lantern
gleamed
through
the
gleaming
snow
on
his
fixed
and
glassy
eyes
then
the
maiden
clasped
her
hands
and
prayed
that
saved
she
might
be
and
she
thought
of
christ
who
stilled
the
wave
on
the
lake
of
galilee
and
fast
through
the
midnight
dark

through

ghost
the
vessel
swept
towards
the

norman

and
ever
the
fitful
gusts
between
a
sound
came
from
the
land
it
was
the
sound
of
the
trampling
surf
on
the
rocks
and
the
hard
the
breakers
were
right
beneath
her
bows
she
drifted
a
dreary
wreck
and
a
whooping
billow
swept
the
crew
like
icicles
from
her
deck
she
struck
where
the
white
and
fleecy
waves
looked
soft
as
carded
wool
but
the
cruel
rocks
they
gored
her
side
like
the
horns
of
an
angry
bull
her
rattling
shrouds
all
sheathed
in
ice
with
the
masts
went
by
the
board
like
a
vessel
of
glass
she
stove
and
sank

ho
the
breakers
roared
at
daybreak
on

fisherman
stood
aghast
to
see
the
form
of
a
maiden
fair
lashed
close
to
a
drifting
mast
the
salt
sea
was
frozen
on
her
breast
the
salt
tears
in
her
eyes
and
he
saw
her
hair
like
the
brown
on
the
billows
fall
and
rise
such
was
the
wreck
of
the
hesperus
in

with

in

saw

and
rest
thy

head
upon

this

in

some

lay

restless
feeling
and
banish

not

footsteps
echo

corridors

time
for
like
strains
of
martial
music
their
mighty
thoughts
suggest
life
endless
toil
and
endeavor
and
i
long
for
rest
read
from
some
humbler
poet
whose
songs
gushed
from
his
heart
as
showers
from
the
clouds
of
summer
or
tears
from
the
eyelids
start
who
through
long
days
of
labor
and
nights
devoid
of
ease
still
heard
in
his
soul
the
music
of
wonderful
melodies
such
songs
have
power
to
quiet
the
restless
pulse
of
care
and
come
like
the
benediction
that
follows
after
prayer
then
read
from
the
treasured
volume
the
poem
of
thy
choice
and
lend
to
the
rhyme
of
the
poet
the
beauty
of
thy
voice
and
the
night
shall
be
filled
with
music
and
the
cares
that
infest
the
day
shall
fold
their
tents
like
the
arabs
and
as
silently
steal
away

the
minnesinger
when
he
left
this
world
of
ours
laid
his
body
in
the
cloister
under
wurtzburg
minster
towers
and
he
gave
the
monks
his
treasures
gave
them
all
with
this
behest
they
should
feed
the
birds
at
noontide
daily
on
his
place
of
rest
saying
from
these
wandering
minstrels
i
have
learned
the
art
of
song
let
me
now
repay
the
lessons
they
have
taught
so
well
and
long
thus
the
bard
of
love
departed
and
fulfilling
his
desire
on
his
tomb
the
birds
were
feasted
by
the
children
of
the
choir
day
by
day
tower
and
turret
in
foul
weather
and
in
fair
day
by
day
in
vaster
numbers
flocked
the
poets
of
the
air
on
the
tree
whose
heavy
branches
overshadowed
all
the
place
on
the
pavement
on
the
tombstone
on
the
poet
sculptured
face
on
the
of
each
window
on
the
lintel
of
each
door
they
renewed
the
war
of
wartburg
which
the
bard
had
fought
before
there
they
sang
their
merry
carols
sang
their
lauds
on
every
side
and
the
name
their
voices
uttered
was
the
name
of
vogelweid
till
at
length
the
portly
abbot
murmured
why
this
waste
of
food
be
it
changed
to
loaves
henceforward
for
our
fasting
brotherhood
then
in
vain
tower
and
turret
from
the
walls
and
woodland
nests
when
the
minster
bells
rang
noontide
gathered
the
unwelcome
guests
then
in
vain
with
cries
discordant
clamorous
round
the
gothic
spire

the
feathered
minnesingers
for
the
children
of
the
choir
time
has
long
effaced
the
inscriptions
on
the
cloister
funeral
stones
and
tradition
only
tells
us
where
repose
the
poet
bones
but
around
the

cathedral

sweet
echoes
multiplied

legend

builders
all
are
architects
of
fate
working
in
these
walls
of
time
some
with
massive
deeds
and
great
some
with
ornaments
of
rhyme
nothing
useless
is
or

each
thing
in
its
place
is
best
and
what
seems
but
idle
show

and
supports
the

for
the
structure
that
we
raise
time
is
with
materials
filled
our
and
yesterdays
are
the
blocks
with
which
we
build
truly
shape
and
fashion
these
leave
no
yawning
gaps
between
think
not
because
no
man
sees
such
things

remain
unseen
in

elder
days
of

builders
wrought
with

care
each

us
do
our
work
as
well
both
the

make

may
dwell
beautiful
entire

then
strong

sure
with
a

find
its

wave
of
deeper
souls
into

lifts
us
unawares
out
of
all
meaner
cares
honor

those

words

thus
help
us
in
our
daily
needs
and
by
their
overflow
raise
us
from
what
is
low
thus
thought
i
as
by
night
i
read
of
the
great
army
of
the
dead
the
trenches
cold
and
damp
the
starved
and
frozen
camp
the
wounded
from
the
in
dreary
hospitals
of
pain
the
cheerless
corridors
the
cold
and
stony
floors
lo
in
that
house
of
misery
a
lady
with
a
lamp
i
see
pass
through
the
glimmering
gloom
and
flit
from
room
to
room
and
slow
as
in
a
dream
of
bliss
the
speechless
sufferer
turns
to
kiss
her
shadow
as
it
falls
upon
the
darkening
walls
as
if
a
door
in
heaven
should
be
opened
and
then
closed
suddenly
the
vision
came
and
went
the
light
shone
and
was
spent
on
england
annals
through
the
long
hereafter
of
her
speech
and
song
that
light
its
rays
shall
cast
from
portals
of
the
past
a
lady
with
a
lamp
shall
stand
in
the
great
history
of
the
land
a
noble
type
of
good
heroic
womanhood
nor
even
shall
be
wanting
here
the
palm
the
lily
and
the
spear
the
symbols
that
of
yore
saint
filomena
bore
the
discoverer
of
the
north
cape
a
leaf
from
king
alfred
orosius
othere
the
old
who
dwelt
in
helgoland
to
king
alfred
the
lover
of
truth
brought
a
which
he
held
in
his
brown
right
hand
his
figure
was
tall
and
stately
like
a
boy
his
eye
appeared
his
hair
was
yellow
as
hay
but
threads
of
a
silvery
gray
gleamed
in
his
tawny
beard
hearty
and
hale
was
othere
his
cheek
had
the
color
of
oak
with
a
kind
of
laugh
in
his
speech
like
the
on
a
beach
as
unto
the
king
he
spoke
and
alfred
king
of
the
saxons
had
a
book
upon
his
knees
and
wrote
down
the
wondrous
tale
of
him
who
was
first
to
sail
into
the
arctic
seas
so
far
i
live
to
the
northward
no
man
lives
north
of
me
to
the
east
are
wild
and
beyond
them
meres
and
plains
to
the
westward
all
is
sea
so
far
i
live
to
the
northward
from
the
harbor
of
if
you
only
sailed
by
day
with
a
fair
wind
all
the
way
more
than
a
month
would
you
sail
i
own
six
hundred
reindeer
with
sheep
and
swine
beside
i
have
tribute
from
the
finns
whalebone
and
and
ropes
of
i
ploughed
the
land
with
horses
but
my
heart
was
ill
at
ease
for
the
old
seafaring
men
came
to
me
now
and
then
with
their
sagas
of
the
seas
of
iceland
and
of
greenland
and
the
stormy
hebrides
and
the
undiscovered
deep
i
could
not
eat
nor
sleep
for
thinking
of
those
seas
to
the
northward
stretched
the
desert
how
far
i
fain
would
know
so
at
last
i
sallied
forth
and
three
days
sailed
due
north
as
far
as
the
go
to
the
west
of
me
was
the
ocean
to
the
right
the
desolate
shore
but
i
did
not
slacken
sail
for
the
walrus
or
the
whale
till
after
three
days
more
the
days
grew
longer
and
longer
till
they
became
as
one
and
southward
through
the
haze
i
saw
the
sullen
blaze
of
the
red
midnight
sun
and
then
uprose
before
me
upon
the
water
edge
the
huge
and
haggard
shape
of
that
unknown
north
cape
whose
form
is
like
a
wedge
the
sea
was
rough
and
stormy
the
tempest
howled
and
wailed
and
the
like
a
ghost
haunted
that
dreary
coast
but
onward
still
i
sailed
four
days
i
steered
to
eastward
four
days
without
a
night
round
in
a
fiery
ring
went
the
great
sun
o
king
with
red
and
lurid
light
here
alfred
king
of
the
saxons
ceased
writing
for
a
while
and
raised
his
eyes
from
his
book
with
a
strange
and
puzzled
look
and
an
incredulous
smile
but
othere
the
old
he
neither
paused
nor
stirred
till
the
king
listened
and
then
once
more
took
up
his
pen
and
wrote
down
every
word
and
now
the
land
said
othere
bent
southward
suddenly
and
i
followed
the
curving
shore
and
ever
southward
bore
into
a
nameless
sea
and
there
we
hunted
the
walrus
the
narwhale
and
the
seal
ha
was
a
noble
game
and
like
the
lightning
flame
flew
our
harpoons
of
steel
there
were
six
of
us
all
together
norsemen
of
helgoland
in
two
days
and
no
more
we
killed
of
them
threescore
and
dragged
them
to
the
strand
here
alfred
the
suddenly
closed
his
book
and
lifted
his
blue
eyes
with
doubt
and
strange
surmise
depicted
in
their
look
and
othere
the
old
stared
at
him
wild
and
weird
then
smiled
till
his
shining
teeth
gleamed
white
from
underneath
his
tawny
quivering
beard
and
to
the
king
of
the
saxons
in
witness
of
the
truth
raising
his
noble
head
he
stretched
his
brown
hand
and
said
behold
this
sandalphon
have
you
read
in
the
talmud
of
old
in
the
legends
the
rabbins
have
told
of
the
limitless
realms
of
the
air
have
you
read
the
marvellous
story
of
sandalphon
te
angel
of
glory
sandalphon
the
angel
of
prayer
how
erect
at
the
outermost
gates
of
the
city
celestial
he
waits
with
his
feet
on
the
ladder
of
light
that
crowded
with
angels
unnumbered
by
jacob
was
seen
as
he
slumbered
alone
in
the
desert
at
night
the
angels
of
wind
and
of
fire
chant
only
one
hymn
and
expire
with
the
song
irresistible
stress
expire
in
their
rapture
and
wonder
as
are
broken
asunder
by
music
they
throb
to
express
but
serene
in
the
rapturous
throng
unmoved
by
the
rush
of
the
song
with
eyes
unimpassioned
and
slow
among
the
dead
angels
the
deathless
sandalphon
stands
listening
breathless
to
sounds
that
ascend
from
below
from
the
spirits
on
earth
that
adore
from
the
souls
that
entreat
and
implore
in
the
fervor
and
passion
of
prayer
from
the
hearts
that
are
broken
with
losses
and
weary
with
dragging
the
crosses
too
heavy
for
mortals
to
bear
and
he
gathers
the
prayers
as
he
stands
and
they
change
into
flowers
in
his
hands
into
garlands
of
purple
and
red
and
beneath
the
great
arch
of
the
portal
through
the
streets
of
the
city
immortal
is
wafted
the
fragrance
they
shed
it
is
but
a
legend
i
know
a
fable
a
phantom
a
show
of
the
ancient
rabbinical
lore
yet
the
old
mediaeval
tradition
the
beautiful
strange
superstition
but
haunts
me
and
holds
me
the
more
when
i
look
from
my
window
at
night
and
the
welkin
above
is
all
white
all
throbbing
and
panting
with
stars
among
them
majestic
is
standing
sandalphon
the
angel
expanding
his
pinions
in
nebulous
bars
and
the
legend
i
feel
is
a
part
of
the
hunger
and
thirst
of
the
heart
the
frenzy
and
fire
of
the
brain
that
grasps
at
the
fruitage
forbidden
the
golden
pomegranates
of
eden
to
quiet
its
fever
and
pain
the
landlord
tale
paul
reveres
ride
listen
my
children
and
you
shall
hear
of
the
midnight
ride
of
paul
revere
on
the
eighteenth
of
april
in
hardly
a
man
is
now
alive
who
remembers
that
famous
day
and
year
he
said
to
his
friend
if
the
british
march
by
land
or
sea
from
the
town
hang
a
lantern
aloft
in
the
belfry
arch
of
the
north
church
tower
as
a
signal
light
one
if
by
land
and
two
if
by
sea
and
i
on
the
opposite
shore
will
be
ready
to
ride
and
spread
the
alarm
through
every
middlesex
village
and
farm
for
the
to
be
up
and
to
arm
then
he
said
good
night
and
with
muffled
oar
silently
rowed
to
the
charlestown
shore
just
as
the
moon
rose
over
the
bay
where
swinging
wide
at
her
moorings
lay
the
somerset
british
a
phantom
ship
with
each
mast
and
spar
across
the
moon
like
a
prison
bar
and
a
huge
black
hulk
that
was
magnified
by
its
own
reflection
in
the
tide
meanwhile
his
friend
through
alley
and
street
wanders
and
watches
with
eager
ears
till
in
the
silence
around
him
he
hears
the
muster
of
men
at
the
barrack
door
the
sound
of
arms
and
the
tramp
of
feet
and
the
measured
tread
of
the
grenadiers
marching
down
to
their
boats
on
the
shore
then
he
climbed
to
the
tower
of
the
church
up
the
wooden
stairs
with
stealthy
tread
to
the
overhead
and
startled
the
pigeons
from
their
perch
on
the
sombre
rafters
that
round
him
made
masses
and
moving
shapes
of
shade
up
the
trembling
ladder
steep
and
tall
to
the
highest
window
in
the
wall
where
he
paused
to
listen
and
look
down
a
moment
on
the
roofs
of
the
town
and
the
moonlight
flowing
over
all
beneath
in
the
churchyard
lay
the
dead
in
their
on
the
hill
wrapped
in
silence
so
deep
and
still
that
he
could
hear
like
a
sentinel
tread
the
watchful
as
it
went
creeping
along
from
tent
to
tent
and
seeming
to
whisper
all
is
well
a
moment
only
he
feels
the
spell
of
the
place
and
the
hour
and
the
secret
dread
of
the
lonely
belfry
and
the
dead
for
suddenly
all
his
thoughts
are
bent
on
a
shadowy
something
far
away
where
the
river
widens
to
meet
the
bay
a
line
of
black
that
bends
and
floats
on
the
rising
tide
like
a
bridge
of
boats
meanwhile
impatient
to
mount
and
ride
booted
and
spurred
with
a
heavy
stride
on
the
opposite
shore
walked
paul
revere
now
he
patted
his
horse
side
now
gazed
at
the
landscape
far
and
near
then
impetuous
stamped
the
earth
and
turned
and
tightened
his
saddlegirth
but
mostly
he
watched
with
eager
search
the
of
the
old
north
church
as
it
rose
above
the
graves
on
the
hill
lonely
and
spectral
and
sombre
and
still
and
lo
as
he
looks
on
the
belfry
height
a
glimmer
and
then
a
gleam
of
light
he
springs
to
the
saddle
the
bridle
he
turns
but
lingers
and
gazes
till
full
on
his
sight
a
second
lamp
in
the
belfry
burns
a
hurry
of
hoofs
in
a
village
street
a
shape
in
the
moonlight
a
bulk
in
the
dark
and
beneath
from
the
pebbles
in
passing
a
spark
struck
out
by
a
steed
flying
fearless
and
fleet
that
was
all
and
yet
through
the
gloom
and
the
light
the
fate
of
a
nation
was
riding
that
night
and
the
spark
struck
out
by
that
steed
in
his
flight
kindled
the
land
into
flame
with
its
heat
he
has
left
the
village
and
mounted
the
steep
and
beneath
him
tranquil
and
broad
and
deep
is
the
mystic
meeting
the
ocean
tides
and
under
the
alders
that
skirt
its
edge
now
soft
on
the
sand
now
loud
on
the
ledge
is
heard
the
tramp
of
his
steed
as
he
rides
it
was
twelve
by
the
village
clock
when
he
crossed
the
bridge
into
medford
town
he
heard
the
crowing
of
the
cock
and
the
barking
of
the
farmer
dog
and
felt
the
damp
of
the
river
fog
that
rises
after
the
sun
goes
down
it
was
one
by
the
village
clock
when
he
galloped
into
lexington
he
saw
the
gilded
weathercock
swim
in
the
moonlight
as
he
passed
and
the
windows
blank
and
bare
gaze
at
him
with
a
spectral
glare
as
if
they
already
stood
aghast
at
the
bloody
work
they
would
look
upon
it
was
two
by
the
village
clock
when
he
came
to
the
bridge
in
concord
town
he
heard
the
bleating
of
the
flock
and
the
twitter
of
birds
among
the
trees
and
felt
the
breath
of
the
morning
breeze
blowing
over
the
meadows
brown
and
one
was
safe
and
asleep
in
his
bed
who
at
the
bridge
would
be
first
to
fall
who
that
day
would
be
lying
dead
pierced
by
a
british
you
know
the
rest
in
the
books
you
have
read
how
the
british
regulars
fired
and
fled
how
the
farmers
gave
them
ball
for
ball
from
behind
each
fence
and
farmyard
wall
chasing
the
down
the
lane
then
crossing
the
fields
to
emerge
again
under
the
trees
at
the
turn
of
the
road
and
only
pausing
to
fire
and
load
so
through
the
night
rode
paul
revere
and
so
through
the
night
went
his
cry
of
alarm
to
every
middlesex
village
and
farm
a
cry
of
defiance
and
not
of
fear
a
voice
in
the
darkness
a
knock
at
the
door
and
a
word
that
shall
echo
forevermore
for
borne
on
the
of
the
past
through
all
our
history
to
the
last
in
the
hour
of
darkness
and
peril
and
need
the
people
will
waken
and
listen
to
hear
the
hurrying
of
that
steed
and
the
midnight
message
of
paul
revere
the
sicilian
tale
king
robert
of
sicily
robert
of
sicily
brother
of
pope
urbane
and
valmond
emperor
of
allemaine
apparelled
in
magnificent
attire
with
retinue
of
many
a
knight
and
squire
on
john
eve
at
vespers
proudly
sat
and
heard
the
priests
chant
the
magnificat
and
as
he
listened
and
again
repeated
like
a
burden
or
refrain
he
caught
the
words
deposuit
potentes
de
sede
et
exaltavit
humiles
and
slowly
lifting
up
his
kingly
head
he
to
a
learned
clerk
beside
him
said
what
mean
these
words
the
clerk
made
answer
meet
he
has
put
down
the
mighty
from
their
seat
and
has
exalted
them
of
low
degree
thereat
king
robert
muttered
scornfully
is
well
that
such
seditious
words
are
sung
only
by
priests
and
in
the
latin
tongue
for
unto
priests
and
people
be
it
known
there
is
no
power
can
push
me
from
my
throne
and
leaning
back
he
yawned
and
fell
asleep
lulled
by
the
chant
monotonous
and
deep
when
he
awoke
it
was
already
night
the
church
was
empty
and
there
was
no
light
save
where
the
lamps
that
glimmered
few
and
faint
lighted
a
little
space
before
some
saint
he
started
from
his
seat
and
gazed
around
but
saw
no
living
thing
and
heard
no
sound
he
groped
towards
the
door
but
it
was
locked
he
cried
aloud
and
listened
and
then
knocked
and
uttered
awful
threatenings
and
complaints
and
imprecations
upon
men
and
saints
the
sounds
from
the
roof
and
walls
as
if
dead
priests
were
laughing
in
their
stalls
at
length
the
sexton
hearing
from
without
the
tumult
of
the
knocking
and
the
shout
and
thinking
thieves
were
in
the
house
of
prayer
came
with
his
lantern
asking
who
is
there
half
choked
with
rage
king
robert
fiercely
said
open
is
i
the
king
art
thou
afraid
the
frightened
sexton
muttering
with
a
curse
this
is
some
drunken
vagabond
or
worse
turned
the
great
key
and
flung
the
portal
wide
a
man
rushed
by
him
at
a
single
stride
haggard
half
naked
without
hat
or
cloak
who
neither
turned
nor
looked
at
him
nor
spoke
but
leaped
into
the
blackness
of
the
night
and
vanished
like
a
spectre
from
his
sight
robert
of
sicily
brother
of
pope
urbane
and
valmond
emperor
of
allemaine
despoiled
of
his
magnificent
attire
breathless
and
besprent
with
mire
with
sense
of
wrong
and
outrage
desperate
strode
on
and
thundered
at
the
palace
gate
rushed
through
the
thrusting
in
his
rage
to
right
and
left
each
seneschal
and
page
and
hurried
up
the
broad
and
sounding
stair
his
white
face
ghastly
in
the
torches
glare
from
hall
to
hall
he
passed
with
breathless
speed
voices
and
cries
he
heard
but
did
not
heed
until
at
last
he
reached
the
banquet
room
blazing
with
light
and
breathing
with
perfume
there
on
the
dais
sat
another
king
wearing
his
robes
his
crown
his
king
robert
self
in
features
form
and
height
but
all
transfigured
with
angelic
light
it
was
an
angel
and
his
presence
there
with
a
divine
effulgence
filled
the
air
an
exaltation
piercing
the
disguise
though
none
the
hidden
angel
recognize
a
moment
speechless
motionless
amazed
the
throneless
monarch
on
the
angel
gazed
who
met
his
looks
of
anger
and
surprise
with
the
divine
compassion
of
his
eves
then
said
who
art
thou
and
why
thou
here
to
which
king
robert
answered
with
a
sneer
i
am
the
king
and
come
to
claim
my
own
from
an
impostor
who
usurps
my
throne
and
suddenly
at
these
audacious
words
up
sprang
the
angry
guests
and
drew
their
swords
the
angel
answered
with
unruffled
brow
nay
not
the
king
but
the
king
jester
thou
henceforth
shalt
wear
the
bells
and
scalloped
cape
and
for
thy
counsellor
shaft
lead
an
ape
thou
shalt
obey
my
servants
when
they
call
and
wait
upon
my
henchmen
in
the
hall
deaf
to
king
robert
threats
and
cries
and
prayers
they
thrust
him
from
the
hall
and
down
the
stairs
a
group
of
tittering
pages
ran
before
and
as
they
opened
wide
the
his
heart
failed
for
he
heard
with
strange
alarms
the
boisterous
laughter
of
the
and
all
the
vaulted
chamber
roar
and
ring
with
the
mock
plaudits
of
long
live
the
king
next
morning
waking
with
the
day
first
beam
he
said
within
himself
it
was
a
dream
but
the
straw
rustled
as
he
turned
his
head
there
were
the
cap
and
bells
beside
his
bed
around
him
rose
the
bare
discolored
walls
close
by
the
steeds
were
champing
in
their
stalls
and
in
the
corner
a
revolting
shape
shivering
and
chattering
sat
the
wretched
ape
it
was
no
dream
the
world
he
loved
so
much
had
turned
to
dust
and
ashes
at
his
touch
days
came
and
went
and
now
returned
again
to
sicily
the
old
saturnian
reign
under
the
angel
governance
benign
the
happy
island
danced
with
corn
and
wine
and
deep
within
the
mountain
burning
breast
enceladus
the
giant
was
at
rest
meanwhile
king
robert
yielded
to
his
fate
sullen
and
silent
and
disconsolate
dressed
in
the
motley
garb
that
jesters
wear
with
looks
bewildered
and
a
vacant
stare
close
shaven
above
the
ears
as
monks
are
shorn
by
courtiers
mocked
by
pages
laughed
to
scorn
his
only
friend
the
ape
his
only
food
what
others
left
he
still
was
unsubdued
and
when
the
angel
met
him
on
his
way
and
half
in
earnest
half
in
jest
would
say
sternly
though
tenderly
that
he
might
feel
the
velvet
scabbard
held
a
sword
of
steel
art
thou
the
king
the
passion
of
his
woe
burst
from
him
in
resistless
overflow
and
lifting
high
his
forehead
he
would
fling
the
haughty
answer
back
i
am
i
am
the
king
almost
three
years
were
ended
when
there
came
ambassadors
of
great
repute
and
name
from
valmond
emperor
of
allemaine
unto
king
robert
saying
that
pope
urbane
by
letter
summoned
them
forthwith
to
come
on
holy
thursday
to
his
city
of
rome
the
angel
with
great
joy
received
his
guests
and
gave
them
presents
of
embroidered
vests
and
velvet
mantles
with
rich
ermine
lined
and
rings
and
jewels
of
the
rarest
kind
then
he
departed
with
them
the
sea
into
the
lovely
land
of
italy
whose
loveliness
was
more
resplendent
made
by
the
mere
passing
of
that
cavalcade
with
plumes
and
cloaks
and
housings
and
the
stir
of
jewelled
bridle
and
of
golden
spur
and
lo
among
the
menials
in
mock
state
upon
a
piebald
steed
with
shambling
gait
his
cloak
of
flapping
in
the
wind
the
solemn
ape
demurely
perched
behind
king
robert
rode
making
huge
merriment
in
all
the
country
towns
through
which
they
went
the
pope
received
them
with
great
pomp
and
blare
of
bannered
trumpets
on
saint
peter
square
giving
his
benediction
and
embrace
fervent
and
full
of
apostolic
grace
while
with
congratulations
and
with
prayers
he
entertained
the
angel
unawares
robert
the
jester
bursting
through
the
crowd
into
their
presence
rushed
and
cried
aloud
i
am
the
king
look
and
behold
in
me
robert
your
brother
king
of
sicily
this
man
who
wears
my
semblance
to
your
eyes
is
an
impostor
in
a
king
disguise
do
you
not
know
me
does
no
voice
within
answer
my
cry
and
say
we
are
akin
the
pope
in
silence
but
with
troubled
mien
gazed
at
the
angel
countenance
serene
the
emperor
laughing
said
it
is
strange
sport
to
keep
a
madman
for
thy
fool
at
court
and
the
poor
baffled
jester
in
disgrace
was
hustled
back
among
the
populace
in
solemn
state
the
holy
week
went
by
and
easter
sunday
gleamed
upon
the
sky
the
presence
of
the
angel
with
its
light
before
the
sun
rose
made
the
city
bright
and
with
new
fervor
filled
the
hearts
of
men
who
felt
that
christ
indeed
had
risen
again
even
the
jester
on
his
bed
of
straw
with
haggard
eyes
the
unwonted
splendor
saw
he
felt
within
a
power
unfelt
before
and
kneeling
humbly
on
his
chamber
floor
he
heard
the
rushing
garments
of
the
lord
sweep
through
the
silent
air
ascending
heavenward
and
now
the
visit
ending
and
once
more
valmond
returning
to
the
danube
shore
homeward
the
angel
journeyed
and
again
the
land
was
made
resplendent
with
his
train
flashing
along
the
towns
of
italy
unto
salerno
and
from
there
by
sea
and
when
once
more
within
palermo
wall
and
seated
on
the
throne
in
his
great
hall
he
heard
the
angelus
from
convent
towers
as
if
the
better
world
conversed
with
ours
he
beckoned
to
king
robert
to
draw
nigher
and
with
a
gesture
bade
the
rest
retire
and
when
they
were
alone
the
angel
said
art
thou
the
king
then
bowing
down
his
head
king
robert
crossed
both
hands
upon
his
breast
and
meekly
answered
him
thou
knowest
best
my
sins
as
scarlet
are
let
me
go
hence
and
in
some
cloister
school
of
penitence
across
those
stones
that
pave
the
way
to
heaven
walk
barefoot
till
my
guilty
soul
is
shriven
the
angel
smiled
and
from
his
radiant
face
a
holy
light
illumined
all
the
place
and
through
the
open
window
loud
and
clear
they
heard
the
monks
chant
in
the
chapel
near
above
the
stir
and
tumult
of
the
street
he
has
put
down
the
mighty
from
their
seat
and
has
exalted
them
of
low
degree
and
through
the
chant
a
second
melody
rose
like
the
throbbing
of
a
single
string
i
am
an
angel
and
thou
art
the
king
king
robert
who
was
standing
near
the
throne
lifted
his
eyes
and
lo
he
was
alone
but
all
apparelled
as
in
days
of
old
with
ermined
mantle
and
with
cloth
of
gold
and
when
his
courtiers
came
they
found
him
there
kneeling
upon
the
floor
absorbed
in
silent
prayer
the
theologian
tale
the
legend
beautiful
hadst
thou
stayed
i
must
have
fled
that
is
what
the
vision
said
in
his
chamber
all
alone
kneeling
on
the
floor
of
stone
prayed
the
monk
in
deep
contrition
for
his
sins
of
indecision
prayed
for
greater
in
temptation
and
in
trial
it
was
noonday
by
the
dial
and
the
monk
was
all
alone
suddenly
as
if
it
lightened
an
unwonted
splendor
brightened
all
within
him
and
without
him
in
that
narrow
cell
of
stone
and
he
saw
the
blessed
vision
of
our
lord
with
light
elysian
like
a
vesture
wrapped
about
him
like
a
garment
round
him
thrown
not
as
crucified
and
slain
not
in
agonies
of
pain
not
with
bleeding
hands
and
feet
did
the
monk
his
master
see
but
as
in
the
village
street
in
the
house
or
halt
and
lame
and
blind
he
healed
when
he
walked
in
galilee
in
an
attitude
imploring
hands
upon
his
bosom
crossed
wondering
worshipping
adoring
knelt
the
monk
in
rapture
lost
lord
he
thought
in
heaven
that
reignest
who
am
i
that
thus
thou
deignest
to
reveal
thyself
to
me
who
am
i
that
from
the
centre
of
thy
glory
thou
shouldst
enter
this
poor
cell
my
guest
to
be
then
amid
his
exaltation
loud
the
convent
bell
appalling
from
its
belfry
calling
calling
rang
through
court
and
corridor
with
persistent
iteration
he
had
never
heard
before
it
was
now
the
appointed
hour
when
alike
in
shine
or
shower
winter
cold
or
summer
heat
to
the
convent
portals
came
all
the
blind
and
halt
and
lame
all
the
beggars
of
the
street
for
their
daily
dole
of
food
dealt
them
by
the
brotherhood
and
their
almoner
was
he
who
upon
his
bended
knee
rapt
in
silent
ecstasy
of
divinest
saw
the
vision
and
the
splendor
deep
distress
and
hesitation
mingled
with
his
adoration
should
he
go
or
should
he
stay
should
he
leave
the
poor
to
wait
hungry
at
the
convent
gate
till
the
vision
passed
away
should
he
slight
his
radiant
guest
slight
this
visitant
celestial
for
a
crowd
of
ragged
bestial
beggars
at
the
convent
gate
would
the
vision
there
remain
would
the
vision
come
again
then
a
voice
within
his
breast
whispered
audible
and
clear
as
if
to
the
outward
ear
do
thy
duty
that
is
best
leave
unto
thy
lord
the
rest
straightway
to
his
feet
he
started
and
with
longing
look
intent
on
the
blessed
vision
bent
slowly
from
his
cell
departed
slowly
on
his
errand
went
at
the
gate
the
poor
were
waiting
looking
through
the
iron
grating
with
that
terror
in
the
eye
that
is
only
seen
in
those
who
amid
their
wants
and
woes
hear
the
sound
of
doors
that
close
and
of
feet
that
pass
them
by
grown
familiar
with
disfavor
grown
familiar
with
the
savor
of
the
bread
by
which
men
die
but
they
know
not
why
like
the
gate
of
paradise
seemed
the
convent
gate
to
rise
like
a
sacrament
divine
seemed
to
them
the
bread
and
wine
in
his
heart
the
monk
was
praying
thinking
of
the
homeless
poor
what
they
suffer
and
endure
what
we
see
not
what
we
see
and
the
inward
voice
was
saying
whatsoever
thing
thou
doest
to
the
least
of
mine
and
lowest
that
thou
doest
unto
me
unto
me
but
had
the
vision
come
to
him
in
beggar
clothing
come
a
mendicant
imploring
would
he
then
have
knelt
adoring
or
have
listened
with
derision
and
have
turned
away
with
loathing
thus
his
conscience
put
the
question
full
of
troublesome
suggestion
as
at
length
with
hurried
pace
towards
his
cell
he
turned
his
face
and
beheld
the
convent
bright
with
a
supernatural
light
like
a
luminous
cloud
expanding
over
floor
and
wall
and
ceiling
but
he
paused
with
feeling
at
the
threshold
of
his
door
for
the
vision
still
was
standing
as
he
left
it
there
before
when
the
convent
bell
appalling
from
its
belfry
calling
calling
summoned
him
to
feed
the
poor
through
the
long
hour
intervening
it
had
waited
his
return
and
he
felt
his
bosom
burn
comprehending
all
the
meaning
when
the
blessed
vision
said
hadst
thou
stayed
i
must
have
fled

comes
you
may
trace
his
footsteps
now
on
the
naked
woods
and
the
blasted
fields
and
the
brown
hill
withered
brow
he
has
smitten
the
leaves
of
the
gray
old
trees
where
their
pleasant
green
came
forth
and
the
winds
which
follow
wherever
he
goes
have
shaken
them
down
to
earth
he

he
comes
the
frost
spirit
comes
from
the
frozen
labrador
from
the
icy
bridge
of
the
northern
seas
which
the
white
bear
wanders
where
the
fisherman
sail
is
stiff
with
ice
and
the
luckless
forms
below
in
the
sunless
cold
of
the
lingering
night
into
marble
statues
grow
he
comes
he
comes
the
frost
spirit
comes
on
the
rushing
northern
blast
and
the
dark
norwegian
pines
have
bowed
as
his
fearful
breath
went
past
with
an
unscorched
wing
he
has
hurried
on
where
the
fires
of
hecla
glow
on
the
darkly
beautiful
sky
above
and
the
ancient
ice
below
he
comes
he
comes
the
frost
spirit
comes
and
the
quiet
lake
shall
feel
the
torpid
touch
of
his
glazing
breath
and
ring
to
the
skater
heel
and
the
streams
which
danced
on
the
broken
rocks
or
sang
to
the
leaning
grass
shall
bow
again
to
their
winter
chain
and
in
mournful
silence
pass
he
comes
he
comes
the
frost
spirit
comes
let
us
meet
him
as
we
may
and
turn
with
the
light
of
the
his
evil
power
away
and
gather
closer
the
circle
round
when
that
dances
high
and
laugh
at
the
shriek
of
the
baffled
fiend
as
his
sounding
wing
goes
by
songs
of
labor
dedication
i
would
the
gift
i
offer
here
might
graces
from
thy
favor
take
and
seen
through
friendship
atmosphere
on
softened
lines
and
coloring
wear
the
unaccustomed
light
of
beauty
for
thy
sake
few
leaves
of
fancy
spring
remain
but
what
i
have
i
give
to
thee
the
bloom
of
summer
plain
and
paler
flowers
the
latter
rain
calls
from
the
weltering
slope
of
life
autumnal
above
the
fallen
groves
of
green
where
youth
enchanted
forest
stood
dry
root
and
mossed
trunk
between
a

seen
as
springs
the
pine
where
falls
the
maple
wood
yet
birds
will
sing
and
breezes
play
their
in
the
sombre
tree
and
through
the
bleak
and
wintry
day
it
keeps
its
steady
green
alway
so
even
my
may
have
a
charm
for
thee
art
perfect
forms
no
moral
need
and
beauty
is
its
own
excuse
but
for
the
dull
and
flowerless
weed
some
healing
virtue
still
must
plead
and
the
rough
ore
must
find
its
honors
in
its
use
so
haply
these
my
simple
lays
of
homely
toil
may
serve
to
show
the

and
tasseled
maize
that
skirt
and
gladden
duty
ways
the
unsung
beauty
hid
life
common
things
below
haply
from
them
the
toiler
bent
above
his
forge
or
plough
may
gain
a
manlier
spirit
of
content
and
feel
that
life
is
wisest
spent
where
the
strong
working
hand
makes
strong
the
working
brain
the
doom
which
to
the
guilty
pair
without
the
walls
of
eden
came
transforming
sinless
ease
to
care
and
rugged
toil
no
more
shall
bear
the
burden
of
old
crime
or
mark
of
primal
shame
a
blessing
now
a
curse
no
more
since
he
whose
name
we
breathe
with
awe
the
coarse
mechanic
vesture
wore
a
poor
man
toiling
with
the
poor
in
labor
as
in
prayer
fulfilling
the
same
law
the
lumbermen
wildly
round
our
woodland
quarters
autumn
grieves
thickly
down

swelling
waters

fallen
leaves

timber

of

soon
his
icy
bridges
heaping

of
smothered
thunder
on
some
night
of
rain
lake
and
river
break
asunder
winter
weakened

down

bear

the

his
teeth
of

in
these
vales
below
when
the
earliest
beams
of

streak
the
mountain

crisps
the
keen

to
our
hurrying
feet

the

the

a
music
wild
and
solemn
from
the
height
rolls
its
vast
and

on
the
wind
of

that
henchman
bold
that
his
laud
so
stout
of
old
now
so
meekly
pleaded
woe
the
day
he
sadly
said
with
a
slowly
shaking
head
and
a
look
of
pity
ury
honest
lord
reviled
mock
of
knave
and
sport
of

in
his

good
city
speak
the
word
and
master
mine
as
we
charged
on
tilly
line
and
his
walloon
lancers
smiting
through
their
midst
we
teach
civil
look
and
decent
speech
to
these
boyish
prancers
marvel
not
mine
ancient
friend
like
beginning
like
the
end
quoth
the
laird
of
ury
is
the
sinful
servant
more
than
his
gracious
lord
who
bore
bonds
and
stripes
in
jewry
give
me
joy
that
in
his
name
i
can
bear
with
patient
frame
all
these
vain
ones
offer
while
for
them
he
suffereth
long
shall
i
answer
wrong
with
wrong
scoffing
with
the
scoffer
happier
i
with
loss
of
all
hunted
outlawed
held
in
thrall
with
few
friends
to
greet
me
than
when
reeve
and
squire
were
seen
riding
out
from
aberdeen
with
bared
heads
to
meet
me
when
each
goodwife
and
blessed
me
as
i
passed
her
door
and
the
snooded
daughter
through
her
casement
glancing
down
smiled
on
him
who
bore
renown
from
red
fields
of
slaughter
hard
to
feel
the
stranger
scoff
hard
the
old
friend
falling
off
hard
to
learn
forgiving
but
the
lord
his
own
rewards
and
his
love
with
theirs
accords
warm
and
fresh
and
living
through
this
dark
and
stormy
night
faith
beholds
a
feeble
light
up
the
blackness
streaking
knowing
god
own
time
is
best
in
a
patient
hope
i
rest
for
the
full
so
the
laird
of
ury
said
turning
slow
his
horse
head
toward
the
tolbooth
prison
where
through
iron
grates
he
heard
poor
disciples
of
the
word
preach
of
christ
arisen
plot
in
vain
confessor
old
unto
us
the
tale
is
told
of
thy
day
of
trial
every
age
on
him
who
strays
from
its
broad
and
beaten
ways
pours
its
sevenfold
vial
happy
he
whose
inward
ear
angel
comfortings
can
hear
the
rabble
laughter
and
while
hatred
fagots
burn
glimpses
through
the
smoke
discern
of
the
good
hereafter
knowing
this
that
never
yet
share
of
truth
was
vainly
set
in
the
world
wide
fallow
after
hands
shall
sow
the
seed
after
hands
from
hill
and
mead
reap
the
harvest
yellow
thus
with
somewhat
of
the
seer
must
the
moral
pioneer
from
the
future
borrow
clothe
the
waste
with
dreams
of
grain
and
on
midnight
sky
of
rain
paint
the
golden
morrow
all
well
the
clouds
which
rise
with
thunder
slake
our
thirsty
souls
with
rain
the
blow
most
dreaded
falls
to
break
from
off
our
limbs
a
chain
and
wrongs
of
man
to
man
but
make
the
love
of
god
more
plain
as
through
the
shadowy
lens
of
even
the
eye
looks
farthest
into
heaven
on
gleams
of
star
and
depths
of
blue
the
glaring
sunshine
never
knew
raphael
i
shall
not
soon
forget
that
sight
the
glow
of
autumn
westering
day
a
hazy
warmth
a
dreamy
light
on
raphael
picture
lay
it
was
a
simple
print
i
saw
the
fair
face
of
a
musing
boy
yet
while
i
gazed
a
sense
of
awe
seemed
blending
with
my
joy
a
simple
print
the
graceful
flow
of
boyhood
soft
and
wavy
hair
and
fresh
young
lip
and
cheek
and
brow
unmarked
and
clear
were
there
yet
through
its
sweet
and
calm
repose
i
saw
the
inward
spirit
shine
it
was
as
if
before
me
rose
the
white
veil
of
a
shrine
as
if
as
gothland
sage
has
told
the
hidden
life
the
man
within
dissevered
from
its
frame
and
mould
by
mortal
eye
were
seen
was
it
the
lifting
of
that
eye
the
waving
of
that
pictured
hand
loose
as
a
on
the
sky
i
saw
the
walls
expand
the
narrow
room
had
vanished
space
broad
luminous
remained
alone
through
which
all
hues
and
shapes
of
grace
and
beauty
looked
or
shone
around
the
mighty
master
came
the
marvels
which
his
pencil
wrought
those
miracles
of
power
whose
fame
is
wide
as
human
thought
there
drooped
thy
more
than
mortal
face
o
mother
beautiful
and
mild
enfolding
in
one
dear
embrace
thy
saviour
and
thy
child
the
rapt
brow
of
the
desert
john
the
awful
glory
of
that
day
when
all
the
father
brightness
shone
through
manhood
veil
of
clay
and
midst
gray
prophet
forms
and
wild
dark
visions
of
the
days
of
old
how
sweetly
woman
beauty
smiled
through
locks
of
brown
and
gold
there
fornarina
fair
young
face
once
more
upon
her
lover
shone
whose
model
of
an
angel
grace
he
borrowed
from
her
own
slow
passed
that
vision
from
my
view
but
not
the
lesson
which
it
taught
the
soft
calm
shadows
which
it
threw
still
rested
on
my
thought
the
truth
that
painter
bard
and
sage
even
in
earth
cold
and
changeful
clime
plant
for
their
deathless
heritage
the
fruits
and
flowers
of
time
we
shape
ourselves
the
joy
or
fear
of
which
the
coming
life
is
made
and
fill
our
future
atmosphere
with
sunshine
or
with
shade
the
tissue
of
the
life
to
be
we
weave
with
colors
all
our
own
and
in
the
field
of
destiny
we
reap
as
we
have
sown
still
shall
the
soul
around
it
call
the
shadows
which
it
gathered
here
and
painted
on
the
eternal
wall
the
past
shall
reappear
think
ye
the
notes
of
holy
song
on
milton
tuneful
ear
have
died
think
ye
that
raphael
angel
throng
has
vanished
from
his
side
o
no
we
live
our
life
again
or
warmly
touched
or
coldly
dim
the
pictures
of
the
past
remain
man
works
shall
follow
him
and
harvest
as
his
furrowed
fields
which
lie
beneath
a
sky
yet
chill
with
winter
melted
snow
the
husbandman
goes
forth
to
sow
thus
freedom
on
the
bitter
blast
the
ventures
of
thy
seed
we
cast
and
trust
to
warmer
sun
and
rain
to
swell
the
germ
and
fill
the
grain
who
calls
thy
glorious
service
hard
who
deems
it
not
its
own
reward
who
for
its
trials
counts
it
less
a
cause
of
praise
and
thankfulness
it
may
not
be
our
lot
to
wield
the
sickle
in
the
ripened
field
nor
ours
to
hear
on
summer
eves
the
reaper
song
among
the
sheaves
yet
where
our
duty
task
is
wrought
in
unison
with
god
great
thought
the
near
and

blend
in
one
and
is

and
ours
the
grateful
service
whence
comes
day
by
day
the
recompense
the
hope
the
trust
the
purpose
stayed
the
fountain
and
the
noonday
shade
and
were
this
life
the
utmost
span
the
only
end
and
aim
of
man
better
the
toil
of
fields
like
these
than
waking
dream
and
slothful
ease
but
life
though
falling
like
our
grain
like
that
revives
and
springs
again
and
early
called
how
blest
are
they
who
wait
in
heaven
their
the
prophecy
of
samuel
sewall
up
and
gown
the
village
streets
strange
are
the
forms
my
fancy
meets
for
the
thoughts
and
things
of
are
hid
and
through
the
veil
of
a
closed
lid
the
ancient
worthies
i
see
again
i
hear
the
tap
of
the
elder
cane
and
his
awful
periwig
i
see
and
the
silver
buckles
of
shoe
and
knee
stately
and
slow
with
thoughtful
air
his
black
cap
hiding
his
whitened
hair
walks
the
judge
of
the
great
assize
samuel
sewall
the
good
and
wise
his
face
with
lines
of
firmness
wrought
he
wears
the
look
of
a
man
unbought
who
swears
to
his
hurt
and
changes
not
yet
touched
and
softened
nevertheless
with
the
grace
of
christian
gentleness
the
face
that
a
child
would
climb
to
kiss
true
and
tender
and
brave
and
just
that
man
might
honor
and
woman
trust
touching
and
sad
a
tale
is
told
like
a
penitent
hymn
of
the
psalmist
old
of
the
fast
which
the
good
man
lifelong
kept
with
a
haunting
sorrow
that
never
slept
as
the
circling
year
brought
round
the
time
of
an
error
that
left
the
sting
of
crime
when
he
sat
on
the
bunch
of
the
witchcraft
courts
with
the
laws
of
moses
and
hales
reports
and
spake
in
the
name
of
both
the
word
that
gave
the
witch
neck
to
the
cord
and
piled
the
oaken
planks
that
pressed
the
feeble
life
from
the
warlock
breast
all
the
day
long
from
dawn
to
dawn
his
door
was
bolted
his
curtain
drawn
no
foot
on
his
silent
threshold
trod
no
eye
looked
on
him
save
that
of
god
as
he
baffled
the
ghosts
of
the
dead
with
charms
of
penitent
tears
and
prayers
and
psalms
and
with
precious
proofs
from
the
sacred
word
of
the
boundless
pity
and
love
of
the
lord
his
faith
confirmed
and
his
trust
renewed
that
the
sin
of
his
ignorance
sorely
rued
might
be
washed
away
in
the
mingled
flood
of
his
human
sorrow
and
christ
dear
blood
green
forever
the
memory
be
of
the
judge
of
the
old
theocracy
whom
even
his
errors
glorified
like
a
sunlit
by
the
cloudy
shadows
which
it
glide
honor
and
praise
to
the
puritan
who
the
halting
step
of
his
age
outran
and
seeing
the
infinite
worth
of
man
in
the
priceless
gift
the
father
gave
in
the
infinite
love
that
stooped
to
save
dared
not
brand
his
brother
a
slave
who
doth
such
wrong
he
was
wont
to
say
in
his
own
quaint
way
flings
up
to
heaven
a
which
god
shall
cast
down
upon
his
head
widely
as
heaven
and
hell
contrast
that
brave
old
jurist
of
the
past
and
the
cunning
trickster
and
knave
of
courts
who
the
holy
features
of
truth
distorts
ruling
as
right
the
will
of
the
strong
poverty
crime
and
weakness
wrong
to

to
the
wronged

weak
deaf

let
him

the
saintly
soul

let
us
turn
and
say
praise
and
thanks
for
an
honest

i
see
far
southward
this
quiet
day
the
hills
of

rolling
away
with
the
many
tints
of
the

gay
dreamily
blending
in
autumn
mist
crimson
and
gold
and
amethyst
long
and
low
with
dwarf

crowned

like
a

aground

over
the
narrow

inland
as
far
as
the

can
go
the
hills
curve
round
like
a
bonded
bow
a
silver
arrow
from
out
them
sprung
i
see
the
shine
of
the
quasycung
and
round
and
round
over
valley
and
hill
old
roads
winding
as
old
roads
will
here
to
a
ferry
and
there
to
a
mill
and
glimpses
of
chimneys
and
gabled
eaves
through
green
elm
arches
and
maple
leaves
old
homesteads
sacred
to
all
that
can
gladden
or
sadden
the
heart
of
man
over
whose
thresholds
of
oak
and
stone
life
and
death
have
come
and
gone
there
pictured

great
beams

from

low
the

glitters
with
polished
wares
the
long
clock
ticks
on

and
glimmering
sands
and
where
north

south
the
run
the
blink
of
the
sea
in
breeze
and
sun
i
see
it
all
like
a
chart
unrolled
but
my
thoughts
are
full
of
the
past
and
old
i
hear
the
tales
of
my
boyhood
told
and
the
shadows
and
shapes
of
early
days
flit
dimly
by
in
the
veiling
haze
with
measured
movement
and
rhythmic
chime
weaving
like
shuttles
my
web
of
rhyme
i
think
of
the
old
man
wise
and
good
who
once
on
yon
misty
hillsides
stood
a
poet
who
never
measured
rhyme
a
seer
unknown
to
his
time
and
propped
on
his
staff
of
age
looked
down
with
his
boyhood
love
on
his
native
town
where
written
as
if
on
its
hills
and
plains
his
burden
of
prophecy
yet
remains
for
the
voices
of
wood
and
wave
and
wind
to
read
in
the
ear
of
the
musing
mind
as
long
as
plum
island
to
guard
the
coast
as
god
appointed
shall
keep
its
post
as
long
as
a
salmon
shall
haunt
the
deep
of
merrimack
river
or
sturgeon
leap
as
long
as

swift
and
slim

their

as

when
the

ripe
and
shorn
and
the
dry
husks
fall
from
the
standing
corn
as
long
as
nature
shall
not
grow
old
nor
drop
her
work
from

doting
hold

her
care
for
the

corn
forget

the
snake
of

far
away
in
the
twilight
time
of
every
people
in

clime
dragons
and
griffins
and
monsters
dire
born
of
water
and
air
and
fire
or
nursed
like
the
python
in

and
ooze
of
the
old
deucalion
flood
crawl
and
wriggle
and
foam
with
rage
through
dusk
tradition
and
ballad
age
so
from
the
childhood
of
newbury
town
and
its
time
of
fable
the
tale
comes
down
of
a
terror
which
haunted
bush
and
brake
the
amphisbaena
the
double
snake
thou
who
makest
the
tale
thy
mirth
consider
that
strip
of
christian
earth
on
the
desolate
shore
of
a
sailless
sea
full
of
terror
and
mystery
from
the
evil
hold
of
the
wood
so
dreary
and
dark
and
old
which
drank
with
its
lips
of
leaves
the
dew
when
time
was
young
and
the
world
was
new
and
wove
its
shadows
with
sun
and
moon
ere
the
stones
of
cheops
were
squared
and
hewn
think
of
the
sea
dread
monotone
of
the
mournful
wail
from
the
blown
of
the
strange
vast
splendors
that
lit
the
north
of
the
troubled
throes
of
the
quaking
earth
and
the
dismal
tales
the
indian
told
till
the
settler
heart
at
his
hearth
grew
cold
and
he
shrank
from
the
tawny
wizard
boasts
and
the
hovering
shadows
seemed
full
of
ghosts
and
above
below
and
on
every
side
the
fear
of
his
creed
seemed
verified
and
think
if
his
lot
were
now
thine
own
to
grope
with
terrors
nor
named
nor
known
how
laxer
muscle
and
weaker
nerve
and
a
feebler
faith
thy
need
might
serve
and
own
to
thyself
the
wonder
more
that
the
snake
had
two
heads
and
not
a
score
whether
he
lurked
in
the
oldtown
fen
or
the
gray
of
the
devil
den
or
swam
in
the
wooded
artichoke
or
coiled
by
the
northman
written
rock
nothing
on
record
is
left
to
show
only
the
fact
that
he
lived
we
know
and
left
the
cast
of
a
double
head
in
the
scaly
mask
which
he
yearly
shed
for
he
earned
a
head
where
his
tail
should
be
and
the
two
of
course
could
never
agree
but
wriggled
about
with
main
and
might
now
to
the
left
and
now
to
the
right
pulling
and
twisting
this
way
and
that
neither
knew
what
the
other
was
at
a
snake
with
two
heads
lurking
so
near
judge
of
the
wonder
guess
at
the
fear
think
what
ancient
gossips
might
say
shaking
their
heads
in
their
dreary
way
between
the
meetings
on
how
urchins
searching
at
day
decline
the
common
pasture
for
sheep
or
kine
the
terrible
heard
in
the
leafy
rustle
or
whir
of
bird
think
what
a
zest
it
gave
to
the
sport
in
of
the
younger
sort
as
over
pastures
reuben
and
dorothy
lagged
behind
and
closer
and
closer
for
fear
of
harm
the
maiden
clung
to
her
lover
arm
and
how
the
spark
who
was
forced
to
stay
by
his
sweetheart
fears
till
the
break
of
day
thanked
the
snake
for
the
fond
delay
far
and
wide
the
tale
was
told
like
a
snowball
growing
while
it
rolled
the
nurse
hushed
with
it
the
baby
cry
and
it
served
in
the
worthy
minister
eye
to
paint
the
primitive
serpent
by
cotton
mather
came
galloping
down
all
the
way
to
newbury
town
with
his
eyes
agog
and
his
ears
set
wide
and
his
marvellous
inkhorn
at
his
side
stirring
the
while
in
the
shallow
pool
of
his
brains
for
the
lore
he
learned
at
school
to
garnish
the
story
with
here
a
streak
of
latin
and
there
another
of
greek
and
the
tales
he
heard
and
the
notes
he
took
behold
are
they
not
in
his
stories
like
dragons
are
hard
to
kill
if
the
snake
does
not
the
tale
runs
still
in
byfield
meadows
on
pipestave
hill
and
still
whenever
husband
and
wife
publish
the
shame
of
their
daily
strife
and
with
mid
tug
and
strain
at
either
end
of
the
the
gossips
say
with
a
knowing
shake
of
their
gray
heads
look
at
the
double
snake
one
in
body
and
two
in
will
the
amphisbaena
is
living
still
maud
muller
maud
muller
on
a
summer
day
raked
the
meadow
sweet
with
hay
beneath
her
torn
hat
glowed
the
wealth
of
simple
beauty
and
rustic
health
singing
she
wrought
and
her
merry
glee
the
echoed
from
his
tree
but
when
she
glanced
to
the
town
white
from
its
looking
down
the
sweet
song
died
and
a
vague
unrest
and
a
nameless
longing
filled
her
breast
a
wish
that
she
hardly
dared
to
own
for
something
better
than
she
had
known
the
judge
rode
slowly
down
the
lane
smoothing
his
horse
chestnut
mane
he
drew
his
bridle
in
the
shade
of
the
to
greet
the
maid
and
ask
a
draught
from
the
spring
that
flowed
through
the
meadow
across
the
road
she
stooped
where
the
cool
spring
bubbled
up
and
filled
for
him
her
small
tin
cup
and
blushed
as
she
gave
it
looking
down
on
her
feet
so
bare
and
her
tattered
gown
thanks
said
the
judge
a
sweeter
draught
from
a
fairer
hand
was
never
quaffed
he
spoke
of
the
grass
and
flowers
and
trees
of
the
singing
birds
and
the
humming
bees
then
talked
of
the
haying
and
wondered
whether
the
cloud
in
the
west
would
bring
foul
weather
and
maud
forgot
her
gown
and
her
graceful
ankles
bare
and
brown
and
listened
while
a
pleased
surprise
looked
from
her
hazel
eyes
at
last
like
one
who
for
delay
seeks
a
vain
excuse
he
rode
away
maud
muller
looked
and
sighed
ah
me
that
i
the
judge
bride
might
be
he
would
dress
me
up
in
silks
so
fine
and
praise
and
toast
me
at
his
wine
my
father
should
wear
a
broadcloth
coat
my
brother
should
sail
a
painted
boat
i
dress
my
mother
so
grand
and
gay
and
the
baby
should
have
a
new
toy
each
day
and
i
feed
the
hungry
and
clothe
the
poor
and
all
should
bless
me
who
left
our
door
the
judge
looked
back
as
he
climbed
the
hill
and
saw
maud
muller
standing
still
a
form
more
fair
a
face
more
sweet
hath
it
been
my
lot
to
meet
and
her
modest
answer
and
graceful
air
show
her
wise
and
good
as
she
is
fair
would
she
were
mine
and
i
like
her
a
harvester
of
hay
no
doubtful
balance
of
rights
and
wrongs
nor
weary
lawyers
with
endless
tongues
but
low
of
cattle
and
song
of
birds
and
health
and
quiet
and
loving
words
but
he
thought
of
his
sisters
proud
and
cold
and
his
mother
vain
of
her
rank
and
gold
so
closing
his
heart
the
judge
rode
on
and
maud
was
left
in
the
field
alone
but
the
lawyers
smiled
that
afternoon
when
he
hummed
in
court
an
old
and
the
young
girl
mused
beside
the
well
till
the
rain
on
the
unraked
clover
he
wedded
a
wife
of
richest
dower
who
lived
for
fashion
as
he
for
power
yet
oft
in
his
marble
hearth
bright
glow
he
watched
a
picture
come
and
go
and
sweet
maud
muller
hazel
eyes
looked
out
in
their
innocent
surprise
oft
when
the
wine
in
his
glass
was
red
he
longed
for
the
wayside
well
instead
and
closed
his
eyes
on
his
garnished
rooms
to
dream
of
meadows
and
and
the
proud
man
sighed
with
a
secret
pain
ah
that
i
were
free
again
free
as
when
i
rode
that
day
where
the
barefoot
maiden
raked
her
hay
she
wedded
a
man
unlearned
and
poor
and
many
children
played
round
her
door
but
care
and
sorrow
and
childbirth
pain
left
their
traces
on
heart
and
brain
and
oft
when
the
summer
sun
shone
hot
on
the
hay
in
the
meadow
lot
and
she
heard
the
little
spring
brook
fall
over
the
roadside
through
the
wall
in
the
shade
of
the
again
she
saw
a
rider
draw
his
rein
and
gazing
down
with
timid
grace
she
felt
his
pleased
eyes
read
her
face
sometimes
her
narrow
kitchen
walls
stretched
away
into
stately
halls
the
weary
wheel
to
a
spinnet
turned
the
tallow
candle
an
astral
burned
and
for
him
who
sat
by
the
chimney
lug
dozing
and
grumbling
pipe
and
mug
a
manly
form
at
her
side
she
saw
and
joy
was
duty
and
love
was
law
then
she
took
up
her
burden
of
life
again
saying
only
it
might
have
been
alas
for
maiden
alas
for
judge
for
rich
repiner
and
household
drudge
god
pity
them
both
and
pity
us
all
who
vainly
the
dreams
of
youth
recall
for
of
all
sad
words
of
tongue
or
pen
the
saddest
are
these
it
might
have
been
ah
well
for
us
all
some
sweet
hope
lies
deeply
buried
from
human
eyes
and
in
the
hereafter
angels
may
roll
the
stone
from
its
grave
away
burns
on
receiving
a
sprig
of
heather
in
blossom
no
more
these
simple
flowers
belong
to
scottish
maid
and
lover
sown
in
the
common
soil
of
song
they
bloom
the
wide
world
over
in
smiles
and
tears
in
sun
and
showers
the
minstrel
and
the
heather
the
deathless
singer
and
the
flowers
he
sang
of
five
together
wild
and
robert
burns
the
moorland
flower
and
peasant
how
at
their
mention
memory
turns
her
pages
old
and
pleasant
the
gray
sky
wears
again
its
gold
and
purple
of
adorning
and
manhood
noonday
shadows
hold
the
dews
of
boyhood
morning
the
dews
that
washed
the
dust
and
soil
from
off
the
wings
of
pleasure
the
sky
that
flecked
the
ground
of
toil
with
golden
threads
of
leisure
i
call
to
mind
the
summer
day
the
early
harvest
mowing
the
sky
with
sun
and
clouds
at
play
and
flowers
with
breezes
blowing
i
hear
the
blackbird
in
the
corn
the
locust
in
the
haying
and
like
the
fabled
hunter
horn
old
tunes
my
heart
is
playing
how
oft
that
day
with
fond
delay
i
sought
the
maple
shadow
and
sang
with
burns
the
hours
away
forgetful
of
the
meadow
bees
hummed
birds
twittered
overhead
i
heard
the
squirrels
leaping
the
good
dog
listened
while
i
read
and
wagged
his
tail
in
keeping
i
watched
him
while
in
sportive
mood
i
read
the
two
dogs
story
and
half
believed
he
understood
the
poet
allegory
sweet
day
sweet
songs
the
golden
hours
grew
brighter
for
that
singing
from
brook
and
bird
and
meadow
flowers
a
dearer
welcome
bringing
new
light
on
nature
beamed
new
glory
over
woman
and
daily
life
and
duty
seemed
no
longer
poor
and
common
i
woke
to
find
the
simple
truth
of
fact
and
feeling
better
than
all
the
dreams
that
held
my
youth
a
still
repining
debtor
that
nature
gives
her
handmaid
art
the
themes
of
sweet
discoursing
the
tender
idyls
of
the
heart
in
every
tongue
rehearsing
why
dream
of
lands
of
gold
and
pearl
of
loving
knight
and
lady
when
farmer
boy
and
barefoot
girl
were
wandering
there
already
i
saw
through
all
familiar
things
the
romance
underlying
the
joys
and
griefs
that
plume
the
wings
of
fancy
skyward
flying
i
saw
the
same
blithe
day
return
the
same
sweet
fall
of
even
that
rose
on
wooded
and
sank
on
crystal
devon
i
matched
with
scotland
heathery
hills
the
and
the
clover
with
ayr
and
doon
my
native
rills
their
chanting
over
rank
and
pomp
as
he
had
seen
i
saw
the
man
uprising
no
longer
common
or
unclean
the
child
of
god
baptizing
with
clearer
eyes
i
saw
the
worth
of
life
among
the
lowly
the
bible
at
his
cotter
hearth
had
made
my
own
more
holy
and
if
at
times
an
evil
strain
to
lawless
love
appealing
broke
in
upon
the
sweet
refrain
of
pure
and
healthful
feeling
it
died
upon
the
eye
and
ear
no
inward
answer
gaining
no
heart
had
i
to
see
or
hear
the
discord
and
the
staining
let
those
who
never
erred
forget
his
worth
in
vain
bewailings
sweet
soul
of
song
i
own
my
debt
uncancelled
by
his
failings
lament
who
will
the
ribald
line
which
tells
his
lapse
from
duty
how
kissed
the
maddening
lips
of
wine
or
wanton
ones
of
beauty
but
think
while
falls
that
shade
between
the
erring
one
and
heaven
that
he
who
loved
like
magdalen
like
her
may
be
forgiven
not
his
the
song
whose
thunderous
chime
eternal
echoes
render
the
mournful
tuscan
haunted
rhyme
and
milton
starry
splendor
but
who
his
human
heart
has
laid
to
nature
bosom
nearer
who
sweetened
toil
like
him
or
paid
to
love
a
tribute
dearer
through
all
his
tuneful
art
how
strong
the
human
feeling
gushes
the
very
moonlight
of
his
song
is
warm
with
smiles
and
blushes
give
lettered
pomp
to
teeth
of
time
so
bonnie
doon
but
tarry
blot
out
the
epic
stately
rhyme
but
spare
his
highland
mary
the
hero
o
fox
a
knight
like
bayard
without
reproach
or
fear
my
light
glove
on
his
casque
of
steel
my
on
his
spear
o
for
the
white

floating
sad
zutphen

above
the
lion
heart
in

the

love
o
that

not
her

that
once

of
snow
once
when
over
purple
mountains
died
away
the
grecian
sun
and
the
far
cyllenian
ranges
paled
and
darkened
one
by
one
fell
the
turk
a
bolt
of
thunder
cleaving
all
the
quiet
sky
and
against
his
sharp
steel
lightnings
stood
the
suliote
but
to
die
woe
for
the
weak
and
halting
the
crescent
blazed
behind
a
curving
line
of
sabres
like
fire
before
the
wind
last
to
fly
and
first
to
rally
rode
he
of
whom
i
speak
when
groaning
in
his
bridle
path
sank
down
like
a
wounded
greek
with
the
rich
albanian
costume
wet
with
many
a
ghastly
stain
gazing
on
earth
and
sky
as
one
who
might
not
gaze
again
he
looked
forward
to
the
mountains
back
on
foes
that
never
spare
then
flung
him
from
his
saddle
and
place
the
stranger
there
hu
through
flashing
sabres
through
a
stormy
hail
of
lead
the
good
thessalian
charger
up
the
slopes
of
olives
sped
hot
spurred
the
turbaned
riders
he
almost
felt
their
breath
where
a
mountain
stream
rolled
darkly
down
between
the
hills
and
death
one
brave
and
manful
struggle
he
gained
the
solid
land
and
the
cover
of
the
mountains
and
the
carbines
of
his
band
it
was
very
great
and
noble
said
the
listener
then
but
one
brave
deed
makes
no
hero
tell
me
what
he
since
hath
been
still
a
brave
and
generous
manhood
still
and
honor
without
stain
in
the
prison
of
the
kaiser
by
the
barricades
of
seine
but
dream
not
helm
and
harness
the
sign
of
valor
true
peace
bath
higher
tests
of
manhood
than
battle
ever
knew
wouldst
know
him
now
behold
him
the
cadmus
of
the
blind
giving
the
dumb
lip
language
the
idiot
clay
a
mind
walking
his
round
of
duty
serenely
day
by
day
with
the
strong
man
hand
of
labor
and
childhood
heart
of
play
true
as
the
knights
of
story
sir
lancelot
and
his
peers
brave
in
his
calm
endurance
as
they
in
tilt
of
spears
as
waves
in
stillest
waters
as
stars
in
noonday
skies
all
that
wakes
to
noble
action
in
his
noon
of
calmness
lies
wherever
outraged
nature
asks
word
or
action
brave
wherever
struggles
labor
wherever
groans
a
slave
wherever
rise
the
peoples
wherever
sinks
a
throne
the
throbbing
heart
of
freedom
finds
an
answer
in
his
own
knight
of
a
better
era
without
reproach
or
fear
said
i
not
well
that
bayards
and
sidneys
still
are
here
the
eternal
goodness
o
friends
with
whom
my
feet
have
trod
the
quiet
aisles
of
prayer
glad
witness
to
your
zeal
for
god
and
love
of
man
i
bear
i
trace
your
lines
of
argument
your
logic
linked
and
strong
i
weigh
as
one
who
dreads
dissent
and
fears
a
doubt
as
wrong
but
still
my
human
hands
are
weak
to
hold
your
iron
creeds
against
the
words
ye
bid
me
speak
my
heart
within
me
pleads
who
fathoms
the
eternal
thought
who
talks
of
scheme
and
plan
the
lord
is
god
he
needeth
not
the
poor
device
of
man
i
walk
with
bare
hushed
feet
the
ground
ye
tread
with
boldness
shod
i
dare
not
fix
with
mete
and
bound
the
love
and
power
of
god
ye
praise
his
justice
even
such
his
pitying
love
i
deem
ye
seek
a
king
i
fain
would
touch
the
robe
that
hath
no
seam
ye
see
the
curse
which
overbroods
a
world
of
pain
and
loss
i
hear
our
lord
beatitudes
and
prayer
upon
the
cross
the
wrong
that
pains
my
soul
below
i
dare
not
throne
above
i
know
not
of
his
hate
i
know
his
goodness
and
his
love
i
dimly
guess
from
blessings
known
of
greater
out
of
sight
and
with
the
chastened
psalmist
own
his
judgments
too
are
right
i
long
for
household
voices
gone
for
vanished
smiles
i
long
but
god
bath
led
my
dear
ones
on
and
he
can
do
no
wrong
i
know
not
what
the
future
hath
of
marvel
or
surprise
assured
alone
that
life
and
death
his
mercy
underlies
and
if
my
heart
and
flesh
are
weak
to
bear
an
untried
pain
the
bruised
reed
he
will
not
break
but
strengthen
and
sustain
no
offering
of
my
own
i
have
nor
works
my
faith
to
prove
i
can
but
give
the
gifts
he
gave
and
plead
his
love
for
love
and
so
beside
the
silent
sea
i
wait
the
muffled
oar
no
harm
from
him
can
come
to
me
on
ocean
or
on
shore
i
know
not
where
his
islands
lift
their
fronded
palms
in
air
i
only
know
i
can
not
drift
beyond
his
love
and
care
o
brothers
if
my
faith
is
vain
if
hopes
like
these
betray
pray
for
me
that
my
feet
may
gain
the
sure
and
safer
way
and
thou
o
lord
by
whom
are
seen
thy
creatures
as
they
be
forgive
me
if
too
close
i
lean
my
human
heart
on
thee
the
pipes
at
lucknow
pipes
of
the
misty
moorlands
voice
of
the
glens
and
hills
the
droning
of
the
torrents
the
treble
of
the
rills
not
the
braes
of
broom
and
heather
nor
the
mountains
dark
with
rain
nor
maiden
bower
nor
border
tower
have
heard
your
sweetest
strain
dear
to
the
lowland
reaper
and
plaided
mountaineer
to
the
cottage
and
the
castle
the
scottish
pipes
are
dear
sweet
sounds
the
ancient
pibroch
mountain
loch
and
glade
but
the
sweetest
of
all
music
the
pipes
at
lucknow
played
day
by
day
the
indian
tiger
louder
yelled
and
nearer
crept
round
and
round
the
near
and
nearer
circles
swept
pray
for
rescue
wives
and
mothers
pray
the
soldier
said
death
between
us
and
the
wrong
and
shame
we
dread
o
they
listened
looked
and
waited
till
their
hope
became
despair
and
the
sobs
of
low
bewailing
filled
the
pauses
of
their
prayer
then
up
spake
a
scottish
maiden
with
her
ear
unto
the
ground
dinna
ye
hear
it
dinna
ye
hear
it
the
pipes
o
havelock
sound
hushed
the
wounded
man
his
groaning
hushed
the
wife
her
little
ones
alone
they
heard
the
and
the
roar
of
sepoy
guns
but
to
sounds
of
home
and
childhood
the
highland
ear
was
true
as
her
mother
the
mountain
pipes
she
knew
like
the
march
of
soundless
music
through
the
vision
of
the
seer
more
of
feeling
than
of
hearing
of
the
heart
than
of
the
ear
she
knew
the
droning
pibroch
she
knew
the
campbell
call
hark
hear
ye
no
macgregor
the
grandest
o
them
all
o
they
listened
dumb
and
breathless
and
they
caught
the
sound
at
last
faint
and
far
beyond
the
goomtee
rose
and
fell
the
piper
blast
then
a
burst
of
wild
thanksgiving
mingled
woman
voice
and
god
be
praised
the
march
of
havelock
the
piping
of
the
clans
louder
nearer
fierce
as
vengeance
sharp
and
shrill
as
swords
at
strife
came
the
wild
macgregor
stinging
all
the
air
to
life
but
when
the
to
plaided
legions
grew
full
tenderly
and
blithesomely
the
pipes
of
rescue
blew
round
the
silver
domes
of
lucknow
moslem
mosque
and
pagan
shrine
breathed
the
air
to
britons
dearest
the
air
of
auld
lang
syne
the
cruel
roll
of
rose
that
sweet
and
homelike
strain
and
the
tartan
clove
the
turban
as
the
goomtee
cleaves
the
plain
dear
to
the
reaper
and
plaided
mountaineer
to
the
cottage
and
the
castle
the
piper
song
is
dear
sweet
sounds
the
gaelic
pibroch
mountain
glen
and
glade
but
the
sweetest
of
all
music
the
pipes
at
lucknow
played
cobbler
keezar
vision
the
beaver
cut
his
timber
with
patient
teeth
that
day
the
minks
were
and
the
crows
surveyors
of
high
way
when
keezar
sat
on
the
hillside
upon
his
cobbler
form
with
a
pan
of
coals
on
either
hand
to
keep
his
warm
and
there
in
the
golden
weather
he
stitched
and
hammered
and
sung
in
the
brook
he
moistened
his
leather
in
the
pewter
mug
his
tongue
well
knew
the
tough
old
teuton
who
brewed
the
stoutest
ale
and
he
paid
the
reckoning
in
the
coin
of
song
and
tale
the
songs
they
still
are
singing
who
dress
the
hills
of
vine
the
tales
that
haunt
the
brocken
and
whisper
down
the
rhine
woodsy
and
wild
and
lonesome
the
swift
stream
wound
away
through
birches
and
scarlet
maples
flashing
in
foam
and
spray
down
on
the
ledges
plunging
in
steep
cascade
tossing
its
waters
against
the
hemlock
shade
woodsy
and
wild
and
lonesome
east
and
west
and
north
and
south
only
the
village
of
fishers
down
at
the
river
mouth
only
here
and
there
a
clearing
with
its
rude
and
new
and
swart
as
indians
where
the
scanty
harvest
grew
no
shout
of
reapers
no
he
heard
and
on
the
green
no
dancing
feet
the
merry
violin
stirred
why
should
folk
be
glum
said
keezar
when
nature
herself
is
glad
and
the
painted
woods
are
laughing
at
the
faces
so
sour
and
sad
small
heed
had
the
careless
cobbler
what
sorrow
of
heart
was
theirs
who
travailed
in
pain
with
the
births
of
god
and
planted
a
state
with
prayers
hunting
of
witches
and
warlocks
smiting
the
heathen
horde
one
hand
on
the
mason
trowel
and
one
on
the
soldier
sword
but
give
him
his
ale
and
cider
give
him
his
pipe
and
song
little
he
cared
for
church
or
state
or
the
balance
of
right
and
wrong
is
work
work
work
he
muttered
and
for
rest
a
snuffle
of
psalms
he
smote
on
his
leathern
apron
with
his
brown
and
waxen
palms
o
for
the
purple
harvests
of
the
days
when
i
was
young
for
the
merry
maidens
and
the
pleasant
songs
they
sung
o
for
the
breath
of
vineyards
of
apples
and
nuts
and
wine
for
an
oar
to
row
and
a
breeze
to
blow
down
the
grand
old
river
rhine
a
tear
in
his
blue
eye
glistened
and
dropped
on
his
beard
so
gray
old
old
am
i
said
keezar
and
the
rhine
flows
far
away
but
a
cunning
man
was
the
cobbler
he
could
call
the
birds
from
the
trees
charm
the
black
snake
out
of
the
ledges
and
bring
back
the
swarming
bees
all
the
virtues
of
herbs
and
metals
all
the
lore
of
the
woods
he
knew
and
the
arts
of
the
old
world
mingled
with
the
marvels
of
the
new
well
he
knew
the
tricks
of
magic
and
the
lapstone
on
his
knee
had
the
gift
of
the
mormon
goggles
or
the
stone
of
doctor
dee
for
the
mighty
master
agrippa
wrought
it
with
spell
and
rhyme
from
a
fragment
of
mystic
moonstone
in
the
tower
of
nettesheim
to
a
cobbler
minnesinger
the
marvellous
stone
gave
he
and
he
gave
it
in
turn
to
keezar
who
brought
it
over
the
sea
he
held
up
that
mystic
lapstone
he
held
it
up
like
a
lens
and
he
counted
the
long
years
coming
by
twenties
and
by
tens
one
hundred
years
quoth
keezar
and
fifty
have
i
told
now
open
the
new
before
me
and
shut
me
out
the
old
like
a
cloud
of
mist
the
blackness
rolled
from
the
magic
stone
and
a
marvellous
picture
mingled
the
unknown
and
the
known
still
ran
the
stream
to
the
river
and
river
and
ocean
joined
and
there
were
the
bluffs
and
the
blue
and
cold
north
hills
behind
but
the
mighty
forest
was
broken
by
many
a
steepled
town
by
many
a
and
many
a
garner
brown
turning
a
score
of

no
more
ran
free
white
sails
on
the
winding
river
white
sails
on
the
sea
below
in
the
noisy
village
the
flags
were
floating
gay
and
shone
on
a
thousand
faces
the
light
of
a
holiday
swiftly
the
rival
ploughmen
turned
the
brown
earth
from
their
shares
here
were
the

there
were
the

fat
were
the

yellow

were
the
apples

and

had
stolen
blushes
from
the

who
shook
them
down
and
with
blooms
of

that
shame
the

what

it
i

said
keezar
am
i
here

i
there

it
a

at

i
look
on

where
are
the
clowns

with
horns
and

and
where
are
the
rhenish

and
where
is
the
foaming
ale
strange
things
i
know
will
happen
strange
things
the

permits

that
droughty

should
be

my
poor

and
the

here
pleasure
without
regretting
and
good
without
abuse
the
holiday
and
the
bridal
of
beauty
and
of

a

there
is
a
quaker

the

they
cut
down

they
own

graceless
town
with
never
a
ranter
to
worry
and
never
a
witch
to
drown
loud
laughed
the
cobbler
keezar
laughed
like
a
gay
tossing
his
arms
above
him
the
lapstone
rolled
away
it
rolled
down
the
rugged
hillside
it
spun
like
a
wheel
bewitched
it
plunged
through
the
leaning
willows
and
into
the
river
pitched
there
in
the
deep
dark
water
the
magic
stone
lies
still
under
the
leaning
willows
in
the
shadow
of
the
hill
but
oft
the
idle
fisher
sits
on
the
shadowy
bank
and
his
dreams
make
marvellous
pictures
where
the
wizard
lapstone
sank
and
still
in
the
summer
twilights
when
the
river
seems
to
run
out
from
the
inner
glory
warm
with
the
melted
sun
the
weary
lingers
beside
the
charmed
stream
and
the
sky
and
the
golden
water
shape
and
color
her
dream
fair
wave
the
sunset
gardens
the
rosy
signals
fly
her
homestead
beckons
from
the
cloud
and
love
goes
sailing
by
the
mayflowers
sad
mayflower
watched
by
winter
stars
and
nursed
by
winter
gales
with
petals
of
the
sleeted
spars
and
leaves
of
frozen
sails
what
had
she
in
those
dreary
hours
within
her
bay
in
common
with
the
flowers
the
first
sweet

no

arches
green
the

day
echo
the

roundelay

vulgar

have
never
trod
a
spot
that
is
sacred
to

and
cod
o
when
i

i
tread
on
the
pride

when

where
the
evening
star
so
holy
shines
i
laugh
at
the

and
the
pride
of

at
the

the

for
what
are

all
in

man
in

in

yon

of
thee
from

lows
not
thine

thy

lent
all

nothing

i
thought
the

note
from

singing
at

on
the
alder
bough
i
brought
him
home
in
his
nest
at

the
song

it
cheers
not

for
i
did
not
bring
home
the

he
sang
to

they
sang
to
my
eye
the
delicate
shells
lay
on
the
shore
the
bubbles
of
the
latest
wave
fresh
pearls
to
their
enamel
gave
and
the
bellowing
of
the
savage
sea
greeted
their
safe
escape
to
me
i
wiped
away
the
weeds
and
foam
i
fetched
my
treasures
home
but
the
poor
unsightly
noisome
things
had
left
their
beauty
on
the
shore
with
the
sun
and
the
sand
and
the
wild
uproar
the
lover
watched
his
graceful
maid
as
the
virgin
train
she
strayed
nor
knew
her
beauty
best
attire
was
woven
still
by
the
choir
at
last
she
came
to
his
hermitage
like
the
bird
from
the

to
the
cage
the
gay
enchantment
was
undone
a
gentle
wife

fairy
none
then
i

it

running
over
the
burrs
i
inhaled
the
violet
breath
around
me
stood
the

lay
on
the

over

soared
the
eternal

full
of
light
and
of

not

no

thorstein
looked
at

where
he
sate
mute
as
a
cloud
amid
the
stormy
hall
and
said
o
skald
sing
now
an
olden
song
such
as
our
fathers
heard
who
led
great
lives
and
as
the
bravest
on
a
shield
is
borne
along
the
waving
host
that
shouts
him
king
so
rode
their
thrones
upon
the
thronging
seas
then
the
old
man
arose
he
stood
with
eyes
that
looked
afar
from
their
still
region
of
perpetual
snow
over
the
little
smokes
and
stirs
of
men
his
head
was
bowed
with
gathered
flakes
of
years
as
winter
bends
the
pine
but
something
triumphed
in
his
brow
and
eye
which
whoso
saw
it
could
not
see
and
crouch
loud
rang
the
emptied
beakers
as
he
mused
brooding
his
eyried
thoughts
then
as
an
eagle
circles
above
the
woods
so
wheeled
his
soul
into
the
air
of
song
high
the
stormy
hall
and
thus
he
sang
the
fletcher
for
his
picks
out
wood
straight
as
light
and
from
a
quiver
full
of
such
as
these
the
wary
matched
against
his
peers
long
doubting
singles
yet
once
more
the
best
who
is
it
that
can
make
such
shafts
as

what
archer
of
his
arrows
is
so
choice
or
hits
the
white
so
surely
they
are
men
the
chosen
of
her
quiver
nor
for
her
will
every
reed
suffice
or
stick
at
random
from
life
vulgar
fagot
plucked
such

ends
but
she
will
have
souls
straight
and
clear
of
toughest
fibre
sound
down
to
the
heart
of
heart
from
these
she
strips
all
needless
stuff
all

hardens
them
from

untoward
feathers
plucks
crumpled
and
cheap
and

with

the
hour
that
passes
is
her
when
she
draws
bow
is
not
across
the
wind
nor
the

her
arrow
sings
for
sun
and

have
plighted
faith
to
her
ere

have

her
trembling
messenger
the
song

old
and
simple
that

good
were
the
days
of
yore
when
men
were
tried
by
ring
of
shields
as
now
by
ring
of
gold
but
while
the
gods
are
left
and
hearts
of
men
and
the

ocean
still
the
days
are
good
through
the
broad
earth

and
knocks
at

she
finds
the
brave
soul
that

he
ceased
and
instantly
the
frothy
tide
of
interrupted
wassail
roared
along
but
leif
the
son
of
eric
sat
apart
musing
and
with
his
eyes
upon
the
fire
saw
shapes
of
arrows
lost
as
soon
as
seen
lint
then
with
that
resolve
his
heart
was
bent
which
like
a
humming
shaft
through
many
a
stripe
of
day
and
night
across
the
unventured
seas
shot
the
brave
prow
to

o

above
all

take
heed
that
thus
thou

shall
ever
rest
sweet

upon
how
sweet
a
nest
watchfully
brooding
them
and
from

of

scatter
thou
many
a

wherefrom
an

may
arise
to
cheer
the

but
yielding
all

shall
shed
a
peacefulness
around
whose
strengthening
joy
may
not

so
shall
thy

be
blest
of

and
thy

never

shall
surely
fall

nobleness
of

the

and

be

a
poem

built
strongly

on
the

and

deep
foundations
lay

i
can
not
say
a
scene
is
fair
because
it
is
beloved
of
thee
but
i
shall
love
to
linger
there
for
sake
of
thy
dear
memory
i
would
not
be
so
coldly
just
as
to
love
only
what
i
must
i
can
not
say
a
thought
is
good
because
thou
foundest
joy
in
it
each
soul
must
choose
its
proper
food
which
nature
hath
decreed
most
fit
but
i
shall
ever
deem
it
so
because
it
made
thy
heart
i
love
thee
for
that
thou
art
fair
and
that
thy
spirit
joys
in
aught
createth
a
new
beauty
there
with
throe
own
dearest
image
fraught
and
love
for
others
sake
that
springs
gives
half
their
charm
to
lovely
things
my
love
i
not
as
all
other
women
are
is
she
that
to
my
soul
is
dear
her
glorious
fancies
come
from
far
beneath
the
silver
and
yet
her
heart
is
ever
near
great
feelings
has
she
of
her
own
which
lesser
souls
may
never
know
god
giveth
them
to
her
alone
and
sweet
they
are
as
any
tone
wherewith
the
wind
may
choose
to
blow
yet
in
herself
she
dwelleth
not
although
no
home
were
half
so
fair
no
simplest
duty
is
forgot
life
hath
no
dim
and
lowly
spot
that
doth
not
in
her
sunshine
share
she
doeth
little
kindnesses
which
most
leave
undone
or
despise
for
naught
that
sets
one
heart
at
ease
and
giveth
happiness
or
peace
is
m
her
eyes
she
hath
no
scorn
of
common
things
and
though
she
seem
of
other
birth
round
us
her
heart
entwines
and
clings
and
patiently
she
folds
her
wings
to
tread
the
humble
paths
of
earth
blessing
she
is
god
made
her
so
and
deeds
of
holiness
fall
from
her
noiseless
as
the
snow
nor
hath
she
ever
chanced
to
know
that
aught
were
easier
than
to
bless
she
is
most
fair
and
thereunto
her
life
loth
rightly
harmonize
feeling
or
thought
that
was
not
true
made
less
beautiful
the
blue
unclouded
heaven
of
her
eyes
she
is
a
woman
one
in
whom
the
of
her
childish
years
hath
never
lost
its
fresh
perfume
though
knowing
well
that
life
bath
room
for
many
blights
and
many
tears
i
love
her
with
a
love
as
still
as
a
broad
river
peaceful
might
which
by
high
tower
and
lowly
mill
goes
wandering
at
its
own
will
and
yet
doth
ever
flow
aright
and
on
its
full
deep
breast
serene
like
quiet
isles
my
duties
lie
it
flows
around
them
and
between
and
makes
them
fresh
and
fair
and
green
sweet
homes
wherein

live
and
die
the

into
the
sunshine
full
of
the
light
leaping
and
flashing
from
morn
till

into
the
moonlight
whiter
than

waving
so
when
the
winds
blow
into
the
starlight
rushing
in

happy
at
midnight
happy
by

ever
in

blithesome
and
cheery
still
climbing
heavenward
never

glad
of
all

still
seeming

my
heart
be

constant
upward
like
thee
the
shepherd
of
king
admetus
there
came
a
youth
upon
the
earth
some
thousand
years
ago
whose
slender
hands
were
nothing
worth
whether
to
plow
to
reap
or
sow
upon
an
empty
he
stretched
some
chords
and
drew
music
that
made
men
bosoms
swell
fearless
or
brimmed
their
eyes
with
dew
then
king
admetus
one
who
had
pure
taste
by
right
divine
decreed
his
singing
not
too
bad
to
hear
between
the
cups
of
wine
and
so
with
being
soothed
into
a
sweet
three
times
his
kingly
beard
he
smoothed
and
made
him
viceroy
his
sheep
his
words
were
simple
words
enough
and
yet
he
used
them
so
that
what
in
other
mouths
was
rough
in
his
seemed
musical
and
low
men
called
him
but
a
shiftless
youth
in
whom
no
good
they
saw
and
yet
unwittingly
in
truth
they
made
his
careless
words
their
law
they
knew
not
how
he
learned
at
all
for
idly
hour
by
hour
he
sat
and
watched
the
dead
leaves
fall
or
mused
upon
a
common
flower
it
seemed
the
loveliness
of
things
did
teach
him
all
their
use
for
in
mere
weeds
and
stones
and
springs
he
found
a
healing
power
profuse
men
granted
that
his
speech
was
wise
but
when
a
glance
they
caught
of
his
slim
grace
and
woman
eyes
they
laughed
and
called
him
yet
after
he
was
dead
and
gone
and
his
memory
dim
earth
seemed
more
sweet
to
live
upon
more
full
of
love
because
of
him
and
day
by
day
more
holy
grew
each
spot
where
he
had
trod

after

knew
their

height
whither
the
brave

climbs
for
light
we
seem
to
do
them
wrong
bringing
our
to
deck
their
hearse
who
in
warm
wrote
their
nobler
verse
our
trivial
song
to
honor
those
who
come
with
ears
attuned
to
strenuous
trump
and

and
shaped
in
their
desire
live
whose
lines
mere
steel
and
fire
yet
sometimes
feathered

are
strong
a
gracious
memory
to
buoy
up
and
save
from
lethe
dreamless

grave
of

unventurous
throng
many
loved

and
lavished

best

amid
the
dust
of

to
find
her
content
at

for
guerdon
of
their
toil
with
the
cast
mantle
she
hath
left
behind
her
many
in
sad
faith
sought
for
her
many
with
crossed
hands
sighed
for
her
but
these
our
brothers
fought
for
her
at
life
dear
peril
wrought
for
her
so
loved
her
that
they
died
for
her
tasting
the
raptured
fleetness
of
her
divine
completeness
their
higher
instinct
knew
those
love
her
best
who
to
themselves
are
true
and
what
they
dare
to
dream
of
dare
to
do
they
followed
her
and
found
her
where
all
may
hope
to
find
not
in
the
ashes
of
the
mind
but
beautiful
with
danger
sweetness
round
her
where
faith
made
whole
with
deed
breathes
its
awakening
breath
into
the
lifeless
creed
they
saw
her
plumed
and
mailed
with
sweet
stern
face
unveiled
and
eyes
look
proud
on
them
in
death
our
slender
life
runs
rippling
by
and
glides
into
the
silent
hollow
of
the
past
what
is
there
that
abides
to
make
the
next
age
better
for
the
last
is
earth
too
poor
to
give
us
something
to
live
for
here
that
shall
outlive
us
some
more
substantial

than
such
as

and

with

moon
the
little
that
we
sec
from

is
never
free
the
little
that
we
do
is
but
true
with
our
laborious
hiving
what
men
call
treasure
and
the
gods
call
dross
life
seems
a
jest
of
fate
contriving
only
secure
in
every
one
conniving
a
long
account
of
nothings
paid
with
loss
where
we
poor
puppets
jerked
by
unseen
wires
after
our
little
hour
of
strut
and
rave
with
all
our
pasteboard
passions
and
desires
loves
hates
ambitions
and
immortal
fires
are
tossed
together
in
the
grave
but
stay
no
age
was
degenerate
unless
men
held
it
at
too
cheap
a
rate
for
in
our
likeness
still
we
shape
our
fate
whither
leads
the
path
to
ampler
fates
that
leads
not
down
through
flowery
meads
to
reap
an
aftermath
of
youth
vainglorious
weeds
but
up
the
steep
amid
the
wrath
and
shock
of
creeds
where
the
world
best
hope
and
stay
by
battle
flashes
gropes
a
desperate
way
and
every
turf
the
fierce
foot
clings
to

peace
hath
her
not
ignoble
wreath
ere
yet
the
sharp
decisive
word
light
the
black
lips
of
cannon
and
the
sword
dreams
in
its
easeful
sheath
but
some
day
the
live
coal
behind
the
thought
whether
from
baal
stone
obscene
or
from
the
shrine
serene
of
god
pure
altar
brought
bursts
up
in
flame
the
war
of
tongue
and
pen
learns
with
what
deadly
purpose
it
was
fraught
and
helpless
in
the
fiery
passion
caught
shakes
all
the
pillared
state
with
shock
of
men
some
day
the
soft
ideal
that
we
wooed
confronts
us
fiercely
pursued
and
trips
reproachful
was
it
then
my
praise
and
not
myself
was
loved
prove
now
thy
truth
i
claim
of
thee
the
promise
of
thy
youth
give
me
thy
life
or
cower
in
empty
phrase
the
victim
of
thy
genius
not
its

life
may
be
given
in
many
ways
and
loyalty
to
truth
be
sealed
as
bravely
in
the
closet
as
the
field
so
bountiful
is
fate
but
then
to
stand
beside
her
when
craven
churls
deride
her
to
front
a
lie
in
arms
and
not
to
yield
this
shows
methinks
god
plan
and
measure
of
a
stalwart
man
limbed
like
the
old
heroic
breeds
who
stands
on
manhood
solid
earth
not
forced
to
frame
excuses
for
his
birth
fed
from

he
our
whom
late

had
led
with
ashes
on

head
wept
with
the
passion
of
an
angry
grief
forgive
me
if
from
present
things
i
turn
to
speak
what
in
my
heart
will
beat
and
burn
and
hang
my
wreath
on
his
urn
nature
they
say
doth
dote
and
can
not
make
a
man
save
on
some
plan
repeating
us
by
rote
for
him
her
moulds
aside
she
threw
and
choosing
sweet
clay
from
the
breast
of
the
unexhausted
west
with
stuff
untainted
shaped
a
hero
new
vise
steadfast
in
the
strength
of
god
and
true
how
beautiful
to
see
once
more
a
shepherd
of
mankind
indeed
who
loved
his
charge
but
never
loved
to
lead
one
whose
meek
flock
the
people
joyed
to
be
not
lured
by
any
cheat
of
birth
but
by
his
human
worth
and
brave
old
wisdom
of
sincerity
they
knew
that
outward
grace
is
dust
they
could
not
choose
but
trust
in
that
mind
unfaltering
skill
and
will
that
bent
like
perfect
steel
to
spring
again
and
thrust
his
was
no
lonely
of

thrusting
to
thin
air
o

our
cloudy
bars
a
now

broad
prairie
rather
genial
fruitful
and
friendly
for
all
human

stars
nothing
of

fronting
mornward
still
ere
any
names
of
serf
and
peer
could
nature
equal
scheme
deface
and
thwart
her
genial
will
here
was
a
type
of
the
true
elder
race
and
one
of
plutarch
men
talked
with
us
face
to
face
i
praise
him
not
it
were
too
late
and
some
innative
weakness
there
must
be
in
him
who
condescends
to
victory
such
as
the
present
gives
and
can
not
wait
safe
in
himself
as
in
a
fate
so
always
firmly
he
he
knew
to
bide
his
time
and
can
his
fame
abide
still
patient
in
his
simple
faith
sublime
till
the
wise
years
decide
great
captains
with
their
guns
and
drums
disturb
our
judgment
for
the
hour
but
at
last
silence
comes
these
all
are
gone
and
standing
like
a
tower
our
children
shall
behold
his
fame
the
brave
foreseeing
man
sagacious
patient
dreading
praise
not
blame
new
birth
of
our
new
soil
the
first
american
the
vision
of
sir
launfal
prelude
to
part
first
over
his
keys
the
musing
organist
beginning
doubtfully
and
far
away
first
lets
his
fingers
wander
as
they
list
and
builds
a
bridge
from
dreamland
for
his
lay
then
as
the
touch
of
his
loved
instrument
gives
hope
and
fervor
nearer
draws
his
theme
first
guessed
by
faint
auroral
flushes
sent
along
the
wavering
vista
of
his
dream
not
only
around
our
infancy
doth
heaven
with
all
its
splendors
lie
daily
with
souls
that
cringe
and
plot
we
sinais
climb
and
know
it
not
over
our
manhood
bend
the
skies
against
our
fallen
and
traitor
lives
the
great
winds
utter
prophecies
with
our
faint
hearts
the
mountain
strives
its
arms
outstretched
the
druid
wood
waits
with
its
benedicite
and
to
our
age
drowsy
blood
mill
shouts
the
inspiring
sea
earth
gets
its
price
for
what
earth
gives
us
the
beggar
is
taxed
for
a
corner
to
die
in
the
priest
hath
his
fee
who
comes
and
shrives
us
we
bargain
for
the
graves
we
lie
in
at
the
devil
booth
are
all
things
sold
each
ounce
of
dross
costs
its
ounce
of
gold
for
a
cap
and
bells
our
lives
we
pay
bubbles
we
buy
with
a
whole
soul
tasking
is
heaven
alone
that
is
given
away
is
only
god
may
be
had
for
the
asking
no
price
is
set
on
the
lavish
summer
june
may
be
had
by
the
poorest
comer
and
what
is
so
rare
as
a
day
in
june
then
if
ever
come
perfect
days
then
heaven
tries
the
earth
if
it
be
in
tune
and
over
it
softly
her
warm
ear
lays
whether
we
look
or
whether
we
listen
we
hear
life
murmur
or
see
it
glisten
every
clod
feels
a
stir
of
might
an
instinct
within
it
that
reaches
and
towers
and
groping
blindly
above
it
for
light
climbs
to
a
soul
in
grass
and
flowers
the
flush
of
life
may
well
be
seen
thrilling
back
over
hills
and
valleys
the
cowslip
startles
in
meadows
green
the
buttercup
catches
the
sun
in
its
chalice
and
there
never
a
leaf
nor
a
blade
too
mean
to
be
some
happy
creature
palace
the
little
bird
sits
at
his
door
in
the
sun
atilt
like
a
blossom
among
the
leaves
and
lets
his
illumined
being
with
the
deluge
of
summer
it
receives
his
mate
feels
the
eggs
beneath
her
wings
and
the
heart
in
her
dumb
breast
flutters
and
sink
he
pings
to
the
wide
world
and
she
to
her
nest
in
the
nice
ear
of
nature
which
song
is
the
best
now
is
the
of
the
year
and
whatever
of
life
bath
ebbed
away
comes
flooding
back
with
a
ripply
cheer
into
every
bare
inlet
and
creek
and
bay
now
the
heart
is
so
full
that
a
drop
overfills
it
we
are
happy
now
because
god
wills
it
no
matter
how
barren
the
past
may
have
been
is
enough
for
us
now
that
the
leaves
are
green
we
sit
in
the
warm
shade
and
feel
right
well
how
the
sap
creeps
up
and
the
blossoms
swell
we
may
shut
our
eyes
but
we
can
not
help
knowing
that
skies
are
clear
and
grass
is
growing
the
breeze
comes
whispering
in
our
ear
that
dandelions
are
blossoming
near
that
maize
has
sprouted
that
streams
are
flowing
that
the
river
is
bluer
than
the
sky
that
the
robin
is
plastering
his
house
hard
by
and
if
the
breeze
kept
the
good
news
back
for
other
couriers
we
should
not
lack
we
could
guess
it
all
by
yon
heifer
lowing
and
hark
how
clear
bold
chanticleer
warmed
with
the
new
wine
of
the
year
tells
all
in
his
lusty
crowing
joy
comes
grief
goes
we
know
not
how
everything
is
happy
now
everything
is
upward
striving
is
as
easy
now
for
the
heart
to
be
true
as
for
grass
to
be
green
or
skies
to
be
blue
tis
the
natural
way
of
living
who
knows
whither
the
clouds
have
fled
in
the
unscarred
heaven
they
leave
no
wake
and
the
eyes
forget
the
tears
they
have
shed
the
heart
forgets
its
sorrow
and
ache
the
soul
partakes
the
season
youth
and
the
sulphurous
rifts
of
passion
and
woe
lie
deep
a
silence
pure
and
smooth
like
craters
healed
with
snow
what
wonder
if
sir
launfal
now
remembered
the
keeping
of
his

me
sech
a
startle
thet
i
woke
an
reverie
what
visionary
tints
the
year
puts
on
when
failing
leaves
falter
through
motionless
air
or
numbly
cling
and
shiver
to
be
gone
how
shimmer
the
low
flats
and
pastures
bare
as
with
her
nectar
hebe
autumn
fills
the
bowl
between
me
and
those
distant
hills
and
smiles
and
shakes
abroad
her
misty
tremulous
hair
no
more
the
landscape
holds
its
wealth
apart
making
me
poorer
in
my
poverty
but
mingles
with
my
senses
and
my
heart
my
own
projected
spirit
seems
to
me
in
her
own
reverie
the
world
to
steep
is
she
that
waves
to
sympathetic
sleep
moving
as
she
is
moved
each
field
and
hill
and
tree
how
fuse
and
mix
with
what
unfelt
degrees
clasped
by
the
faint
horizon
languid
arms
each
into
each
the
hazy
distances
the
softened
season
all
the
landscape
charms
those
hills
my
native
village
that
embay
in
waves
of
dreamier
purple
roll
away
and
floating
in
mirage
seem
all
the
glimmering
farms
far
distant
sounds
the
hidden
chickadee
close
at
my
side
far
distant
sound
the
leaves
the
fields
seem
fields
of
dream
where
memory
wanders
like
gleaning
ruth
and
as
the
sheaves
of
wheat
and
barley
wavered
in
the
eye
of
boaz
as
the
maiden
glow
went
by
so
tremble
and
seem
remote
all
things
the
sense
receives
the
cock
shrill
trump
that
tells
of
scattered
corn
passed
breezily
on
by
all
his
flapping
mates
faint
and
more
faint
from
barn
to
barn
is
borne
southward
perhaps
to
far
magellan
straits
dimly
i
catch
the
throb
of
distant
flails
silently
overhead
the
henhawk
sails
with
watchful
measuring
eye
and
for
his
quarry
waits
the
sobered
robin
now
leeks
blue
his
autumn
cheer
the
squirrel
on
the
shingly
shagbark
bough
now
saws
now
lists
with
downward
eye
and
ear
then
drops
his
nut
and
with
a
chipping
bound
whisks
to
his
winding
fastness
underground
the
clouds
like
swans
drift
down
the
streaming
atmosphere
yon
bare
knoll
the
pointed
cedar
shadows
drowse
on
the
crisp
gray
moss
the
ploughman
call
creeps
faint
as
smoke
from
black
meadows
the
single
crow
a
single
caw
lets
fall
and
all
around
me
every
bush
and
tree
says
autumn
here
and
winter
soon
will
who
snows
his
soft
white
sleep
and
silence
over
all
the
birch
most
shy
and
of
trees
her
poverty
as
best
she
may
retrieves
and
hints
at
her
foregone
gentilities
with
some
saved
relics
of
her
wealth
of
leaves
the
with
his
royal
purple
on
glares
red
as
blood
across
the
sinking
sun
as
one
who
proudlier
to
a
falling
fortune
cleaves
he
looks
a
sachem
in
red
blanket
wrapt
who
mid
some
council
of
the
whites
erect
and
stern
in
his
own
memories
lapt
with
distant
eye
broods
over
other
sights
sees
the
hushed
wood
the
city
flare
replace
the
wounded
turf
heal
the
railway
trace
and
roams
the
savage
past
of
his
undwindled
rights
the
yields
all
for
lost
and
with
his
crumpled
foliage
stiff
and
dry
after
the
first
betrayal
of
the
frost
rebuffs
the
kiss
of
the
relenting
sky
the
chestnuts
lavish
of
their
gold
to
the
faint
summer
beggared
now
and
old
pour
back
the
sunshine
hoarded
her
favoring
eye
the
ash
her
purple
drops
forgivingly
and
sadly
breaking
not
the
general
hush
the
glow
like
a
sunset
sea
each
leaf
a
ripple
with
its
separate
flush
all
round
the
wood
edge
creeps
the
skirting
blaze
of
bushes
low
as
when
on
cloudy
days
ere
the
rain
falls
the
cautious
farmer
burns
his
brush
yon
low
wall
which
guards
one
unkempt
zone
where
vines
and
weeds
and
intertwine
safe
from
the
plough
whose
rough
discordant
stone
is
massed
to
one
soft
gray
by
lichens
fine
the
tangled
blackberry
crossed
and
recrossed
weaves
a
prickly
network
of
ensanguined
leaves
hard
by
with
coral
beads
the
prim
shine
pillaring
with
flame
this
crumbling
boundary
whose
loose
blocks
topple
the
ploughboy
foot
who
with
each
sense
shut
fast
except
the
eye
creeps
close
and
scares
the
jay
he
hoped
to
shoot
the
woodbine
up
the
elm
straight
stem
aspires
coiling
it
harmless
with
autumnal
fires
in
the
ivy
paler
blaze
the
martyr
oak
stands
mute
below
the
charles
a
stripe
of
nether
sky
now
hid
by
rounded
between
whose
gaps
the
misplaced
sail
sweeps
bellying
by
now
flickering
golden
through
a
woodland
screen
then
spreading
out
at
his
next
turn
beyond
a
silver
circle
like
an
inland
pond
slips
seaward
silently
through
marshes
purple
and
green
dear
marshes
vain
to
him
the
gift
of
sight
who
can
not
in
their
various
incomes
share
from
every
season
drawn
of
shade
and
light
who
sees
in
them
but
levels
brown
and
bare
each
change
of
storm
or
sunshine
scatters
free
on
them
its
largesse
of
variety
for
nature
with
cheap
means
still
works
her
wonders
rare
in
spring
they
lie
one
broad
expanse
of
green
which
the
light
winds
run
with
glimmering
feet
here
yellower
stripes
track
out
the
creek
unseen
here
darker
growths
hidden
ditches
meet
and
purpler
stains
show
where
the
blossoms
crowd
as
if
the
silent
shadow
of
a
cloud
hung
there
becalmed
with
the
next
breath
to
fleet
all
round
upon
the
river
slippery
edge
witching
to
deeper
calm
the
drowsy
tide
whispers
and
leans
the
sedge
through
emerald
glooms
the
lingering
waters
slide
or
sometimes
wavering
throw
back
the
sun
and
the
stiff
banks
in
eddies
melt
and
run
of
dimpling
light
and
with
the
current
seem
to
glide
in
summer
is
a
blithesome
sight
to
see
as
step
by
step
with
measured
swing
they
pass
the
mowers
evading
to
the
knee
their
sharp
scythes
panting
through
the
grass
then
stretched
beneath
a
rick
shade
in
a
ring
their
nooning
take
while
one
begins
to
sing
a
stave
that
droops
and
dies
the
close
sky
of
brass
meanwhile
the
the
bobolink
remembering
duty
in
stops
just
ere
he
sweeps
rapture
tremulous
brink
and
the
winrows
most
demurely
drops
a
decorous
bird
of
business
who
provides
for
his
brown
mate
and
fledglings
six
besides
and
looks
from
right
to
left
a
farmer
mid
his
crops
another
change
subdues
them
in
the
fall
but
saddens
not
they
still
show
merrier
tints
though
sober
russet
seems
to
cover
all
when
the
first
sunshine
through
their
glints
look
how
the
yellow
clearness
streamed
across
redeems
with
rarer
hues
the
season
loss
as
dawn
feet
there
had
touched
and
left
their
rosy
prints
or
come
when
sunset
gives
its
freshened
zest
lean
the
bridge
and
let
the
ruddy
thrill
while
the
shorn
sun
swells
down
the
hazy
west
glow
opposite
the
marshes
drink
their
fill
and
swoon
with
purple
veins
then
slowly
fade
through
pink
to
brown
as
eastward
moves
the
shade
lengthening
with
stealthy
creep
of
simond
darkening
hill
later
and
yet
ere
winter
wholly
shuts
ere
through
the
first
dry
snow
the
runner
grates
and
the
loath
screams
in
slippery
ruts
while
the
firmer
ice
the
eager
boy
awaits
trying
each
buckle
and
strap
beside
the
fire
and
until
bedtime
plays
with
his
desire
twenty
times
putting
on
and
off
his
skates
then
every
morn
the
river
banks
shine
bright
with
smooth
treacherous
and
frail
by
the
frost
clinking
hammers
forged
at
night
gainst
which
the
lances
of
the
sun
prevail
giving
a
pretty
emblem
of
the
day
when
guitar
arms
in
light
shall
melt
away
and
states
shall
move
free
limbed
loosed
from
war
cramping
mail
and
now
those
waterfalls
the
ebbing
river
twice
everyday
creates
on
either
side
tinkle
as
through
their
grots
they
shiver
in
channels
to
the
sun
denied
high
flaps
in
sparkling
blue
the
crow
the
silvered
flats
gleam
frostily
below
suddenly
drops
the
gull
and
breaks
the
glassy
tide
but
crowned
in
turn
by
vying
seasons
three
their
winter
halo
hath
a
fuller
ring
this
glory
seems
to
rest
immovably
the
others
were
too
fleet
and
vanishing
when
the
hid
tide
is
at
its
highest
flow
marsh
and
stream
one
breathless
trance
of
snow
with
brooding
fulness
awes
and
hushes
everything
the
sunshine
seems
blown
off
by
the
bleak
wind
as
pale
as
formal
candles
lit
by
day
gropes
to
the
sea
the
river
dumb
and
blind
the
brown
ricks
by
the
storm
in
play
show
pearly
breakers
combing
their
lee
white
crests
as
of
some
just
enchanted
sea
checked
in
their
maddest
leap
and
hanging
poised
midway
but
when
the
eastern
blow
with
rain
aslant
from
prairies
green
and
rolling
plains
drives
in
his
wallowing
herds
of
billows
gaunt
and
the
roused
charles
remembers
in
his
veins
old
ocean
blood
and
snaps
his
gyves
of
frost
that
tyrannous
silence
on
the
shores
is
tost
in
dreary
wreck
and
crumbling
desolation
reigns
edgewise
or
flat
in
device
with
leaden
pools
between
or
gullies
bare
the
blocks
lie
strewn
a
bleak
stonehenge
of
ice
no
life
no
sound
to
break
the
grim
despair
save
sullen
plunge
as
through
the
sedges
stiff
down
crackles
riverward
some
cliff
or
ashen
the
fields
of
ice
crunch
here
and
there
but
let
me
turn
from
scenes
to
that
whose
pastoral
calm
before
me
lies
here
nothing
harsh
or
rugged
intervenes
the
early
evening
with
her
misty
dyes
smooths
off
the
ravelled
edges
of
the
nigh
relieves
the
distant
with
her
cooler
sky
and
tones
the
landscape
down
and
soothes
the
wearied
eyes
there
gleams
my
native
village
dear
to
me
though
higher
change
waves
each
day
are
seen
whelming
fields
famed
in
boyhood
history
sanding
with
houses
the
diminished
green
there
in
red
brick
which
softening
time
defies
stand
square
and
stiff
the
muses
factories
how
with
my
life
knit
up
is
every
scene
flow
on
dear
river
not
alone
you
flow
to
outward
sight
and
through
your
marshes
wind
fed
from
the
mystic
springs
of
your
twin
flows
silent
through
my
world
of
mind
grow
dim
dear
marshes
in
the
evening
gray
before
my
inner
sight
ye
stretch
away
and
will
forever
though
these
fleshly
eyes
grow
blind
a
fable
for
critics
selections
emerson
there
comes
emerson
first
whose
rich
words
every
one
are
like
gold
nails
in
temples
to
hang
trophies
on
whose
prose
is
grand
verse
while
his
verse
the
lord
knows
is
some
of
it
pr
no
is
not
even
prose
i
speaking
of
metres
some
poems
have
welled
from
those
rare
depths
of
soul
that
have
been
excelled
they
not
epics
but
that
does
matter
a
pin
in
creating
the
only
hard
thing
to
begin
a
no
easier
to
make
than
an
oak
if
you
once
found
the
way
you
achieved
the
grand
stroke
in
the
worst
of
his
poems
are
mines
of
rich
matter
but
thrown
in
a
heap
with
a
crash
and
a
clatter
now
it
is
not
one
thing
nor
another
alone
makes
a
poem
but
rather
the
general
tone
the
something
pervading
uniting
the
whole
the
before
unconceived
unconceivable
soul
so
that
just
in
removing
this
trifle
or
that
you
take
away
as
it
were
a
chief
limb
of
the
statue
roots
wood
bark
and
leaves
singly
perfect
may
be
but
clapt
together
they
do
make
a
tree
but
to
come
back
to
emerson
whom
by
the
way
i
believe
we
left
waiting
his
is
we
may
say
a
greek
head
on
right
yankee
shoulders
whose
range
has
olympus
for
one
pole
for
t
other
the
exchange
life
nature
lore
god
and
affairs
of
that
sort
he
looks
at
as
merely
ideas
in
short
as
if
they
were
fossils
stuck
round
in
a
cabinet
of
such
vast
extent
that
our
earth
a
mere
dab
in
it
composed
just
as
he
is
inclined
to
conjecture
her
namely
one
part
pure
earth
parts
pure
lecturer
you
are
filled
with
delight
at
his
clear
demonstration
each
figure
word
gesture
just
fits
the
occasion
with
the
quiet
precision
of
science
he
sort
em
but
you
ca
help
suspecting
the
whole
a
post
mortem
ii
bryant
there
is
bryant
as
quiet
as
cool
and
as
dignified
as
a
smooth
silent
iceberg
that
never
is
ignified
save
when
by
reflection
is
kindled
o
nights
with
a
semblance
of
flame
by
the
chill
northern
nights
he
may
rank
griswold
says
so
first
bard
of
your
nation
there
no
doubt
that
he
stands
in
supreme
iceolation
your
topmost
parnassus
he
may
set
his
heel
on
but
no
warm
applauses
come
peal
following
peal
on
he
too
smooth
and
too
polished
to
hang
any
zeal
on
unqualified
merits
i
grant
if
you
choose
he
has
em
but
he
lacks
the
one
merit
of
kindling
enthusiasm
if
he
stir
you
at
all
it
is
just
on
my
soul
like
being
stirred
up
with
the
very
north
pole
he
is
very
nice
reading
in
summer
but
inter
nos
we
do
want
extra
freezing
in
winter
take
him
up
in
the
depth
of
july
my
advice
is
when
you
feel
an
egyptian
devotion
to
ices
but
deduct
all
you
can
there
enough
that
right
good
in
him
he
has
a
true
soul
for
field
river
and
wood
in
him
and
his
heart
in
the
midst
of
brick
walls
or
it
is
glows
softens
and
thrills
with
the
tenderest
charities
to
you
mortals
that
delve
in
this
planet
no
to
old
berkshire
hills
with
their
lime
stone

whinier
there
is
whinier
whose
swelling
and
vehement
heart
strains
the
drab
of
the
quaker
apart
and
reveals
the
live
man
still
supreme
and
erect
underneath
the
bemummying
wrappers
of
sect
there
was
a
man
born
who
had
more
of
the
swing
of
the
true
lyric
bard
and
all
that
kind
of
thing
and
his
failures
arise
though
perhaps
he
do
know
it
from
the
very
same
cause
that
has
made
him
a
poet
a
fervor
of
mind
which
knows
no
separation
simple
excitement
and
pure
inspiration
as
my
pythoness
erst
sometimes
erred
from
not
knowing
if
i
or
mere
wind
through
her
tripod
was
blowing
let
his
mind
once
get
head
in
its
favorite
direction
and
the
torrent
of
verse
bursts
the
dams
of
reflection
while
borne
with
the
rush
of
the
metre
along
the
poet
may
chance
to
go
right
or
go
wrong
content
with
the
whirl
and
delirium
of
song
then
his
grammar
not
always
correct
nor
his
rhymes
and
he
prone
to
repeat
his
own
lyrics
sometimes
not
his
best
though
for
those
are
struck
off
at
when
the
heart
in
his
breast
like
a
beats
and
can
be
repeated
again
any
more
than
they
could
have
been
carefully
plotted
before
all
honor
and
praise
to
the
bard
who
was
true
to
the
voice
when
such
service
was
hard
who
himself
was
so
free
he
dared
sing
for
the
slave
when
to
look
but
a
protest
in
silence
was
brave
iv
hawthorne
is
hawthorne
with
genius
so
shrinking
and
rare
that
you
hardly
at
first
see
the
strength
that
is
there
a
frame
so
robust
with
a
nature
so
sweet
so
earnest
so
graceful
so
solid
so
fleet
is
worth
a
descent
from
olympus
to
meet
is
as
if
a
rough
oak
that
for
ages
had
stood
with
his
gnarled
bony
branches
like
ribs
of
the
wood
should
bloom
after
cycles
of
struggle
and
scathe
with
a
single
anemone
trembly
and
rathe
his
strength
is
so
tender
his
wildness
so
meek
that
a
suitable
parallel
sets
one
to
seek
he
a
john
bunyan
fouque
a
puritan
tieck
when
nature
was
shaping
him
clay
was
not
granted
for
making
so
a
man
as
she
wanted
so
to
fill
out
her
model
a
little
she
spared
from
some
stuff
for
a
woman
prepared
and
she
could
not
have
hit
a
more
excellent
plan
for
making
him
fully
and
perfectly
man
the
success
of
her
scheme
gave
her
so
much
delight
that
she
tried
it
again
shortly
after
in
dwight
only
while
she
was
kneading
and
shaping
the
clay
she
sang
to
her
work
in
her
sweet
childish
way
and
found
when
she
put
the
last
touch
to
his
soul
that
the
music
had
somehow
got
mixed
with
the
whole
cooper
here
cooper
who
written
six
volumes
to
show
he
as
good
as
a
lord
well
let
grant
that
he
so
if
a
person
prefer
that
description
of
praise
why
a
coronet
certainly
cheaper
than
bays
but
he
need
take
no
pains
to
convince
us
he
not
as
his
enemies
say
the
american
scott
choose
any
twelve
men
and
let
read
aloud
that
one
of
his
novels
of
which
he
most
proud
and
i
lay
any
bet
that
without
ever
quitting
their
box
they
be
all
to
a
man
for
acquitting
he
has
drawn
you
he
character
though
that
is
new
one
wildflower
he
plucked
that
is
wet
with
the
dew
of
this
fresh
western
world
and
the
thing
not
to
mince
he
has
done
naught
but
copy
it
ill
ever
since
his
indians
with
proper
respect
be
it
said
are
just
natty
bumpo
daubed
over
with
red
and
his
very
long
toms
are
the
same
useful
nat
rigged
up
in
duck
pants
and
a
hat
though
once
in
a
coffin
a
good
chance
was
found
to
have
slipt
the
old
fellow
away
underground
all
his
other
are
clothes
upon
sticks
the
derniere
chemise
of
a
man
in
a
fix
as
a
captain
besieged
when
his
garrison
small
bets
up
caps
upon
poles
to
be
seen
the
wall
and
the
women
he
draws
from
one
model
do
vary
all
sappy
as
maples
and
flat
as
a
prairie
when
a
character
wanted
he
goes
to
the
task
as
a
cooper
would
do
in
composing
a
cask
he
picks
out
the
staves
of
their
qualities
heedful
just
hoops
them
together
as
tight
as
is
needful
and
if
the
best
fortune
should
crown
the
attempt
he
has
made
at
the
most
something
wooden
and
empty
do
suppose
i
would
underrate
cooper
abilities
if
i
thought
you
do
that
i
should
feel
very
ill
at
ease
the
men
who
have
given
to
one
character
life
and
objective
existence
are
not
very
rife
you
may
number
them
all
both
and
singers
without
overrunning
the
bounds
of
your
fingers
and
natty
wo
go
to
oblivion
quicker
than
adams
the
parson
or
primrose
the
vicar
there
is
one
thing
in
cooper
i
like
too
and
that
is
that
on
manners
he
lectures
his
countrymen
gratis
not
precisely
so
either
because
for
a
rarity
he
is
paid
for
his
tickets
in
unpopularity
now
he
may
overcharge
his
american
pictures
but
you
grant
there
a
good
deal
of
truth
in
his
strictures
and
i
honor
the
man
who
is
willing
to
sink
half
his
present
repute
for
the
freedom
to
think
and
when
he
has
thought
be
his
cause
strong
or
weak
will
risk
half
for
the
freedom
to
speak
caring
naught
for
what
vengeance

has
in

that
mob
be

there
comes

with
his
raven
like

of

and
sheer
fudge
who
talks
like
a
book
of
iambs
and
pentameters
in
a
way
to
make
people
of
damn
metres
who
has
written
some
things
quite
the
best
of
their
kind

the

somehow
seems
all
squeezed
out
by
the
mind
who
but
what
this
messieurs
mathews

you
must
fling
at

so
does
it
make
a
man
worse
that
his
character
such
as
to
make
his
friends
love
him
as
you
thin
too
much
why
there
is
not
a
bard
at
this
moment
alive
more
willing
than
he
that
his
fellows
should
thrive
while
you
are
abusing
him
thus
even
now

either
one
of
you
out
of

may
say
that

all
that
till
you
hoarse

remember
that

as
much
as
you

rare
tender
pastoral
evangeline
that
not
ancient

modern
its

from

the
way
the

writes
which
pricks
down

most

worse

brambles
and
boulders
but
he
ca
with
that
bundle
he
has
on
his
shoulders
the
top
of
the
hill
he
will
come
nigh
reaching
till
he
learns
the
distinction
singing
and
preaching
his
lyre
has
some
chords
that
would
ring
pretty
well
but
he
rather
by
half
make
a
drum
of
the
shell
and
rattle
away
till

of

march

x
spirit
of
ancient
poetry
my
friends
in
the
happier
days
of
the
muse
we
were
luckily
free
from
such
things
as
reviews
then
naught
came
between
with
its
fog
to
make
clearer
the
heart
of
the
poet
to
that
of
his
hearer
then
the
poet
brought
heaven
to
the
people
and
they
felt
that
they
too
were
poets
in
hearing
his
lay
then
the
poet
was
prophet
the
past
in
his
soul
the
future
both
parts
of
one
whole
then
for
him
there
was
nothing
too
great
or
too
small
for
one
natural
deity
sanctified
all
then
the
bard
owned
no
clipper
and
meter
of
moods
save
the
spirit
of
silence
that
hovers
and
broods
the
seas
and
the
mountains
the
rivers
and
woods
he
asked
not
earth
verdict
forgetting
the
clods
his
soul
soared
and
sang
to
an
audience
of
gods
was
for
them
that
he
measured
the
thought
and
the
line
and
shaped
for
their
vision
the
perfect
design
with
as
glorious
a
foresight
a
balance
as
true
as
swung
out
the
worlds
in
the
infinite
blue
then
a
glory
and
greatness
invested
man
heart
the
universal
which
now
stands
estranged
and
apart
in
the
free
individual
moulded
was
art
then
the
forms
of
the
artist
seemed
thrilled
with
desire
for
something
as
yet
unattained
fuller
higher
as
once
with
her
lips
lifted
hands
and
eyes
listening
and
her
whole
upward
soul
in
her
countenance
glistening
eurydice
stood
like
a
beacon
unfired
which
once
touched
with
flame
will
leap
inspired
and
waited
with
answering
kindle
to
mark
the
first
gleam
of
orpheus
that
pained
the
red
dark
then
painting
song
sculpture
did
more
than
relieve
the
need
that
men
feel
to
create
and
believe
and
as
in
all
beauty
who
listens
with
love
hears
these
words
oft
repeated
and
above
so
these
seemed
to
be
but
the
visible
sign
of
the
grasp
of
the
soul
after
things
more
divine
they
were
ladders
the
artist
erected
to
climb
the
narrow
horizon
of
space
and
of
time
and
we
see
there
the
footsteps
by
which
men
had
gained
to
the
one
rapturous
glimpse
of
the
as
shepherds
could
erst
sometimes
trace
in
the
sod
the
last
spurning
print
of
a
god
oliver
wendell
holmes
old
ironsides
ay
tear
her
tattered
ensign
down
long
has
it
waved
on
high
and
many
an
eye
has
danced
to
see
that
banner
in
the
sky
beneath
it
rung
the
battle
shout
and
burst
the
cannon
roar
the
meteor
of
the
ocean
air
shall
sweep
the
clouds
no
more
her
deck
once
red
with
heroes
blood
where
knelt
the
vanquished
foe
when
winds
were
hurrying
the
floods
and
waves
were
white
below
no
more
shall
feel
the
victor
tread
or
know
the
conquered
knee
the
harpies
of
the
shore
shall
pluck
the
eagle
of
the
sea
o
better
that
her
shattered
hulk
should
sink
beneath
the
wave
her
thunders
shook
the
mighty
deep
and
there
should
be
her
grave
nail
to
the
mast
her
holy
flag
set
every
threadbare
sail
and
give
her
to
the
god
of
storms
the
lightning
and
the
gale
the
last
leaf
i
saw
him
once
before
as
he
passed
by
the
door
and
again
the
pavement
stones
resound
as
he
totters
the
ground
with
his
cane
they
say
that
in
his
prime
ere
the
of
time
cut
him
down
not
a
better
man
was
found
by
the
crier
on
his
round
through
the
town
but
now
he
walks
the
streets
and
he
looks
at
all
he
meets
sad
and
wan
and
he
shakes
his
feeble
head
that
it
seems
as
if
he
said
they
are
gone
the
mossy
marbles
rest
on
the
lips
that
he
has
prest
in
their
bloom
and
the
names
he
loved
to
hear
have
been
carved
for
many
a
year
on
the
tomb
my
grandmamma
has
said
poor
old
lady
she
is
dead
long
ago
that
he
had
a
roman
nose
and
his
cheek
was
like
a
rose
in
the
snow
but
now
his
nose
is
thin
and
it
rests
upon
his
chin
like
a
staff
and
a
crock
is
in
his
back
and
a
melancholy
crack
in
his
laugh
i
know
it
is
a
sin
for
me
to
sit
and
grin
at
him
here
but
the
old
hat
and
the
breeches
and
all
that
are
so
queer
and
if
i
should
live
to
be
the
last
leaf
upon
the
tree
in
the
spring
let
them
smile
as
i
do
now
at
the
old
forsaken
bough
where
i
cling
my
aunt
my
aunt
my
dear
unmarried
aunt
long
years
have
her
flown
yet
still
she
strains
the
aching
clasp
that
binds
her
virgin
zone
i
know
it
hurts
her
though
she
looks
as
cheerful
as
she
can
her
waist
is
ampler
than
her
life
for
life
is
but
a
span
my
aunt
my
poor
deluded
aunt
her
hair
is
almost
gray
why
will
she
train
that
winter
curl
in
such
a
way
how
can
she
lay
her
glasses
down
and
say
she
reads
as
well
when
through
a
double
convex
lens
she
just
makes
out
to
spell
her
father
grandpapa
forgive
this
erring
lip
its
smiles
vowed
she
should
make
the
finest
girl
within
a
hundred
miles
he
sent
her
to
a
stylish
school
was
in
her
thirteenth
june
and
with
her
as
the
rules
required
two
towels
and
a
spoon
they
braced
my
aunt
against
a
board
to
make
her
straight
and
tall
they
laced
her
up
they
starved
her
down
to
make
her
light
and
small
they
pinched
her
feet
they
singed
her
hair
they
screwed
it
up
with
pins
o
never
mortal
suffered
more
in
penance
for
her
sins
so
when
my
precious
aunt
was
done
my
grandsire
brought
her
back
by
daylight
lest
some
rabid
youth
might
follow
on
the
track
ah
said
my
grandsire
as
he
shook
some
powder
in
his
pan
what
could
this
lovely
creature
do
against
a
desperate
man
alas
nor
chariot
nor
barouche
nor
bandit
cavalcade
tore
from
the
trembling
father
arms
his
maid
for
her
how
happy
had
it
been
and
heaven
had
spared
to
me
to
see
one
sad
ungathered
rose
on
my
ancestral
tree
the
chambered
nautilus
this
is
the
ship
of
pearl
which
poets
feign
sails
the
unshadowed
main
the
venturous
bark
that
flings
on
the
sweet
summer
wind
its
purpled
wings
in
gulfs
enchanted
where
the
siren
sings
and
coral
reefs
lie
bare
where
the
cold
rise
to
sun
their
streaming
hair
its
webs
of
living
gauze
no
more
unfurl
wrecked
is
the
ship
of
pearl
and
every
chambered
cell
where
its
dim
dreaming
life
was
wont
to
dwell
as
the
frail
tenant
shaped
his
growing
shell
before
thee
lies
revealed
its
irised
ceiling
rent
its
sunless
crypt
unsealed
year
after
year
beheld
the
silent
toil
that
spread
his
lustrous
coil
mill
as
the
spiral
grew
he
left
the
past
year
dwelling
for
the
new
stole
with
soft
step
its
shining
archway
through
built
up
its
idle
door
stretched
m
his
home
and
knew
the
old
no
more
thanks
for
the
heavenly
message
brought
by
thee
child
of
the
wandering
sea
cast
from
her
lap
forlorn
from
thy
dead
lips
a
clearer
note
is
born
than
ever
triton
blew
from
wreathed
horn
while
on
mine
ear
it
rings
through
the
deep
caves
of
thought
i
hear
a
voice
that
sings
build
thee
more
stately
mansions
o
my
soul
as
the
swift
seasons
roll
leave
thy
past
let
each
new
temple
nobler
than
the
last
shut
thee
from
heaven
with
a
dome
more
vast
till
thou
at
length
art
free
leaving
thine
outgrown
shell
by
life
unresting
sea
contentment
man
wants
but
little
here
below
little
i
ask
my
wants
are
few
i
only
wish
a
hut
of
stone
a
very
plain
brown
stone
will
do
that
i
may
call
my
own
and
close
at
hand
is
such
a
one
in
yonder
street
that
fronts
the
sun
plain
food
is
quite
enough
for
me
three
courses
are
as
good
as
ten
if
nature
can
subsist
on
three
thank
heaven
for
three
amen
i
always
thought
cold
victual
nice
my
choice
would
be
i
care
not
much
for
gold
or
land
give
me
a
mortgage
here
and
there
some
good
some
note
of
hand
or
trifling
railroad
share
i
only
ask
that
fortune
send
a
little
more
than
i
shall
spend
honors
are
silly
toys
i
know
and
titles
are
but
empty
names
i
would
perhaps
be
plenipo
but
only
near
james
i
very
sure
i
should
not
care
to
fill
our
gubernator
chair
jewels
are
bawbles
is
a
sin
to
care
for
such
unfruitful
things
one
diamond
in
a
pin
some
not
so
large
in
rings
a
ruby
and
a
pearl
or
so
will
do
for
me
i
laugh
at
show
my
dame
should
dress
in
cheap
attire
good
heavy
silks
are
never
dear
i
own
perhaps
i
might
desire
some
shawls
of
true
cashmere
some
marrowy
crapes
of
china
silk
like
wrinkled
skins
on
scalded
milk
i
would
not
have
the
horse
i
drive
so
fast
that
folks
must
stop
and
stare
an
easy
gait
two
suits
me
i
do
not
care
perhaps
for
just
a
single
spurt
some
seconds
less
would
do
no
hurt
of
pictures
i
should
like
to
own
titians
and
raphaels
three
or
four
i
love
so
much
their
style
and
tone
one
turner
and
no
more
a
landscape
foreground
golden
dirt
the
sunshine
painted
with
a
of
books
but
few
some
fifty
score
for
daily
use
and
bound
for
wear
the
rest
upon
an
upper
floor
some
little
luxury
there
of
red
morocco
gilded
gleam
and
vellum
rich
as
country
cream
busts
cameos
gems
such
things
as
these
which
others
often
show
for
pride
i
value
for
their
power
to
please
and
selfish
churls
deride
one
stradivarius
i
confess
two
meerschaums
i
would
fain
possess
wealth
wasteful
tricks
i
will
not
learn
nor
ape
the
glittering
upstart
fool
shall
not
carved
tables
serve
my
turn
but
all
must
be
of
buhl
give
grasping
pomp
its
double
share
i
ask
but
one
recumbent
chair
thus
humble
let
me
live
and
die
nor
long
for
midas
golden
touch
if
heaven
more
generous
gifts
deny
i
shall
not

them

too
grateful

the

the
deacon
masterpiece
or
the
wonderful
shay
a
logical
story
have
you
heard
of
the
wonderful
shay
that
was
built
in
such
a
logical
way
it
ran
a
hundred
years
to
a
day
and
then
of
a
sudden
it
ah
but
stay
i
tell
you
what
happened
without
delay
scaring
the
parson
into
fits
frightening
people
out
of
their
wits
have
you
ever
heard
of
that
i
say
seventeen
hundred
and
georgius
secundus
was
then
alive
snuffy
old
drone
from
the
german
hive
that
was
the
year
when
saw
the
earth
open
and
gulp
her
down
and
braddock
army
was
done
so
brown
left
without
a
scalp
to
its
crown
it
was
on
the
terrible
that
the
deacon
finished
the
shay
now
in
building
of
chaises
i
tell
you
what
there
is
always
somewhere
a
weakest
spot
in
hub
tire
felloe
in
spring
or
thill
in
panel
or
crossbar
or
floor
or
sill
in
screw
bolt
thoroughbrace
lurking
still
find
it
somewhere
you
must
and
will
above
or
below
or
within
or
without
and
that
the
reason
beyond
a
doubt
that
a
chaise
breaks
down
but
does
wear
out
but
the
deacon
swore
as
deacons
do
with
an
i
dew
vum
or
an
i
tell
yeou
he
would
build
one
shay
to
beat
the
taown
the
keounty
all
the
kentry
raoun
it
should
be
so
built
that
it
couldn
break
daown
fur
said
the
deacon
it
mighty
plain
thut
the
weakes
place
mus
stan
the
strain
the
way
t
fix
it
uz
i
maintain
is
only
jest
t
make
that
place
uz
strong
uz
the
rest
so
the
deacon
inquired
of
the
village
folk
where
he
could
find
the
strongest
oak
that
could
be
split
nor
bent
nor
broke
that
was
for
spokes
and
floor
and
sills
he
sent
for
lancewood
to
make
the
thins
the
crossbars
were
ash
from
the
straightest
trees
the
panels
of
that
cuts
like
cheese
but
lasts
like
iron
for
things
like
these
the
hubs
of
logs
from
the
settler
ellum
last
of
its
timber
they
could
sell
never
an
axe
had
seen
their
chips
and
the
wedges
flew
from
between
their
lips
their
blunt
ends
frizzled
like
step
and
bolt
and
screw
spring
tire
axle
and
linchpin
too
steel
of
the
finest
bright
and
blue
thoroughbrace
thick
and
wide
boot
top
dasher
from
tough
old
hide
found
in
the
pit
when
the
tanner
died
that
was
the
way
he
put
her
through
there
said
the
deacon
naow
she
dew
do
i
tell
you
i
rather
guess
she
was
a
wonder
and
nothing
less
colts
grew
horses
beards
turned
gray
deacon
and
deaconess
dropped
away
children
and
grandchildren
where
were
they
but
there
stood
the
stout
old
shay
as
fresh
as
on
eighteen
hundred
it
came
and
found
the
deacon
masterpiece
strong
and
sound
eighteen
hundred
increased
by
ten
hahnsum
kerridge
they
called
it
then
eighteen
hundred
and
twenty
came
running
as
usual
much
the
same
thirty
and
forty
at
last
arrive
and
then
come
fifty
and
little
of
all
we
value
here
wakes
on
the
morn
of
its
hundredth
year
without
both
feeling
and
looking
queer
in
fact
there
nothing
that
keeps
its
youth
so
far
as
i
know
but
a
tree
and
truth
this
is
a
moral
that
runs
at
large
take
you
no
extra
charge
first
of
november
the
there
are
traces
of
age
in
the
shay
a
general
flavor
of
mild
decay
but
nothing
local
as
one
may
say
there
could
be
for
the
deacon
art
had
made
it
so
like
in
every
part
that
there
was
a
chance
for
one
to
start
for
the
wheels
were
just
as
strong
as
the
thins
and
the
floor
was
just
as
strong
as
the
sills
and
the
panels
just
as
strong
as
the
floors
and
the
neither
less
nor
more
and
the
as
strong
as
the
fore
and
spring
and
axle
and
hub
encore
and
yet
as
a
whole
it
is
past
a
doubt
in
another
hour
it
will
be
worn
out
first
of
november
this
morning
the
parson
takes
a
drive
now
small
boys
get
out
of
the
way
here
comes
the
wonderful
shay
drawn
by
a
bay
huddup
said
the
off
went
they
the
parson
was
working
his
sunday
text
had
got
to
fifthly
and
stopped
perplexed
at
what
the
moses
was
coming
next
all
at
once
the
horse
stood
still
close
by
the
on
the
hill
first
a
shiver
and
then
a
thrill
then
something
decidedly
like
a
spill
and
the
parson
was
sitting
upon
a
rock
at
half
past
nine
by
the
clock
just
the
hour
of
the
earthquake
shock
what
do
you
think
the
parson
found
when
he
got
up
and
stared
around
the
poor
old
chaise
in
a
heap
or
mound
as
if
it
had
been
to
the
mill
and
ground
you
see
of
course
if
you
not
a
dunce
how
it
went
to
pieces
all
at
once
all
at
once
and
nothing
first
just
as
bubbles
do
when
they
burst
end
of
the
wonderful
shay
logic
is
logic
that
all
i
say
thomas
buchanan
read
storm
on
bernard
oh
heaven
it
is
a
fearful
thing
beneath
the
tempest
beating
wing
to
struggle
like
a
stricken
hare
when
swoops
the
monarch
bird
of
air
to
breast
the
loud
winds
fitful
spasms
to
brave
the
cloud
and
shun
the
chasms
tossed
like
a
fretted
between
the
ocean
and
the
gale
along
the
valley
loud
and
fleet
the
rising
tempest
leapt
and
roared
and
scaled
the
alp
till
from
his
seat
the
throned
eternity
of
snow
his
frequent
avalanches
poured
in
thunder
to
the
storm
below
and
now
to
crown
their
fears
a
roar
like
ocean
battling
with
the
shore
or
like
that
sound
which
night
and
day
breaks
through
niagara
veil
of
spray
from
some
great
height
within
the
cloud
to
some
unmeasured
valley
driven
swept
down
and
with
a
voice
so
loud
it
seemed
as
it
would
shatter
heaven
the
bravest
quailed
it
swept
so
near
it
made
the
ruddiest
cheek
to
blanch
while
look
replied
to
look
in
fear
the
avalanche
the
avalanche
it
forced
the
foremost
to
recoil
before
its
sideward
billows
thrown
who
cried
o
god
here
ends
our
toil
the
path
is
overswept
and
gone
the
night
came
down
the
ghostly
dark
made
ghostlier
by
its
sheet
of
snow
wailed
round
them
its
tempestuous
wo
like
death
announcing
courier
hark
there
heard
you
not
the
bark
and
there
again
and
there
ah
no
is
but
the
blast
that
mocks
us
so
then
through
the
thick
and
blackening
mist
death
glared
on
them
and
breathed
so
near
some
felt
his
breath
grow
almost
warm
the
while
he
whispered
in
their
ear
of
sleep
that
should
the
storm
then
lower
drooped
their
lids
when
list
now
heard
you
not
the
ring
and
there
again
and
twice
and
thrice
ah
no
is
but
the
thundering
of
tempests
on
a
crag
of
ice
death
smiled
on
them
and
it
seemed
good
on
such
a
mellow
bed
to
lie
the
storm
was
like
a
lullaby
and
drowsy
pleasure
soothed
their
blood
but
still
the
sturdy
practised
guide
his
unremitting
labour
plied
now
this
one
shook
until
he
woke
and
closer
wrapt
the
other
cloak
still
shouting
with
his
utmost
breath
to
startle
back
the
hand
of
death
brave
words
of
cheer
but
hark
again
between
the
blasts
the
sound
is
plain
the
storm
inhaling
lulls
and
hark
it
is
it
is
the
bark
and
on
the
tempest
passing
swell
the
voice
of
cheer
so
long
debarred
there
swings
the
convent
the
sacred
bell
of
saint
bernard
drifting
my
soul
is
far
away
sailing
the
vesuvian
bay
my
winged
boat
a
bird
afloat
swings
round
the
purple
peaks
remote
round
purple
peaks
it
sails
and
seeks
blue
inlets
and
their
crystal
creeks
where
high
rocks
throw
through
deeps
below
a
duplicated
golden
glow
far
vague
and
dim
the
mountains
swim
while
an
vesuvius
misty
brim
with
outstretched
hands
the
gray
smoke
stands
the
volcanic
lands
here
ischia
smiles
liquid
miles
and
yonder
bluest
of
the

calm
capri
waits
her
sapphire
gates
beguiling
to

bright

i
heed
not
if
my
rippling
skiff
float
swift
or
slow
from

to

with
dreamful
eyes
my
spirit
lies
under
the
walls
of

under

where
swells
and

the

deep

at
intervals
at
peace
i

blown
softly
by

i

within

shadow
of

a
joy
intense
the
cooling
sense
glides
down
my
drowsy
indolence
with
dreamful
eyes
my

lies
where
summer
sings

never

with

glows

among

on

the

in

to

this
his
intention
was
no
more
than
to
display
in

pictures
the
life
of

man
of
genius
resisting
all
temptations
laying
aside
all
fears
heedless

pressing

purpose
his

he
passes
through

of

where
the
peasants
can
not

him
and
where

watchword
is

he
disregards
the
happiness
of

peace
and
sees
the

his
fate
before
him
he
disregards

warnings
of
the
old

wisdom
he
answers
to
all
yet
the
monks
of
bernard
are
the
representatives
of
religious
forms

and
with
their
prayer
mingles
the
sound
of
his
voice
telling
them
there
is
something
higher
than
forms
and
ceremonies
filled
with
these
aspirations
he
perishes
without
having
reached
the
perfection
he
longed
for
and
the

heard
in

promise
