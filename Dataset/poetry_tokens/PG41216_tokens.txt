such
as
shakespeare
and
the
rest
of
them
big
literary
gents
and
dressed
in
velvet
clothes
write
up
the
things
i
see
in
some
grand
style
to
show
that
browning
he
hast
been
done
up
and
when
plain
folks
request
my
autograph
then
out
my
chest
make
them
wish
that
they
wast
great
like
me
tired
midst
where
cheap
things
art
always
to
be
done
rather
loaf
and
dream
and
have
long
hair
like
all
great
poets
dost
and
oh
what
fun
to
dash
off
lays
and
sell
them
then
and
there
whenever
be
any
thoughts

about
mary
and
her
pet

kind
and
mistress
went

if
the
little
creature
wast
content
if
it
couldst
only
be
where
she
wast
oh
i
realize
what
madest
it
hanker
so
to
be
in
school
that
day
it
surely
meant
it
loved
her
yet
that
mean
old
teacher
bent
on
things
he
didst
not
seem
to
know
sometimes
i
get
to
i
might
be
a
little
lamb
like
fond

sanderson

about
how

thou

for
thou
hast
some
traits
that
are
truly
cute
and
others
still
so
it
must
be
confessed
that
i
hast
learned
in
sorrow
to
detest
fun
to
see
thee
in
thy
manner
mute
when
boys
dost
tease
thee

some
one

he
deems
thee
a

some
other

we
at
thy

thou
to

wrote
whilst
of
our
parents
in
the
garden
of
eden
o
adam
and
o
eve
how
very
nice
it
must
have
been
to
live
where
you
wast
at
no
neighbors
anywhere
with
whom
to
spat
nor
any
one
to
give
you
free
advice
ma
says
gladly
pay
any
price
for
such
a
and
certain
that
because
there
wert
no
servants
in
your
flat
is
how
you
camest
to
call
it
and
pa
says
that
if
eve
hadst
dressed
the
way
our
women
do
we
shouldst
have
missed
the
fate
of
forth
into
the
world
to
stray

from

received

o
reader
hast
thou
not
in
poems
wrote
for
show
observed
how
many
of
them
start
with
well
anyhow
there
is
an
awful
lot
the
noble
deeds
thou
are
not
forgot
but
serve
to
make
thy
name
we
go
a
household
word
if
all
they
say
is
so
thou
didst
some
mighty
clever
stunts
what
and
yet
thy
fame
belongest
to
thy
dad
thou
shinest
by
reflected
light
forsooth
for
thou
the
only
boy
that
ever
had
a
pa
who
when
his
son
dared
tell
the
truth
about
some
kiddish
prank
didst
not
get
mad

lamm
him

thou
youth
thoughts
thought
about
notions
love
and
when
sister
maymie
saidst
like
to
learn
to
sweep
the
keys
of
a
ma
she
spoke
up
and
cut
her
right
off
short
and
saidst
rather
that
a
girl
of
her
shouldst
know
just
how
to
sweep
a
room
nor
spurn
a
poor
but
honest
man
for
the
sort
pa
wast
and
ma
insists
no
woman
ort
to
spend
more
money
than
a
man
canst
earn
a
dandy
with
a
hat

proud
cousin
say
but
he

sly
home

be
next

he
vowed

no

of
peary
on
a
hot
summer
day
o
peary
with
the
summer
here
and
everybody
double
price
for
little
weeny
teeny
bits
of
ice
it
dost
no
longer
seem
so
very
queer
that
thou
shouldst
have
the
bravery
to
steer
thy
ship
up
north
where
it
is
cool
and
nice
bet
you
smile
whilst
thou
hast
twice
the
fun
at
this
time
of
year
and
say
old
boy
since
thou
dost
understand
the
pole
is
an
imaginary
spot
why
not
thou
hast
found
it
and
of
time
and
trouble
save
an
awful
lot
couldst
others
track
thee
to
that
frozen
land
and
prove
thou
didst
not
find
it
i
guess
not
thoughts
thought
whilst
of
a
day
turkey
o
eagle
emblem
of
my
country
thou
who
art
the
boss
of
every
other
bird
my
muse
to
find
the
highfalutin
word
with
which
to
name
thee
dost
not
know
just
how
yet
not
thee
who
hast
i
must
allow
my
patriotic
breast
the
deepest
stirred
and
they
who
planned
our
banner
erred
in
thee
the
sign
to
which
we
bow
for
whilst
o
eagle
thou
dost
dare
to
climb
the
highest
mountain
peak
and
greet
the
sun
it
is
the
turkey
that
dost
nearest
rhyme
with
all
the
lofty
thrills
that
through
us
run
he
beats
thee
to
a
standstill
every
time
for
stuffed
and
roasted
say
he
takes
the
bun
sonnet
wrote
whilst
of
my
sister
homely
beau
o
love
saidst
that
thou
art
blind
alas
i
didst
not
think
that
it
wast
truly
so
until
i
saw
my
sister
beau
awful
stingy
and
as
green
as
grass
how
love
canst
make
such
guys
as
he
is
pass
for
something
beautiful
i
dost
not
know
hadst
i
my
way
you
bet
stand
no
show
of
in
our
parlor
gas
he
steals
things
too
last
night
whilst
in
a
nook
of
our
dark
hall
i
heardst
him
say
i
must
steal
one
this
morn
i
to
look
and
all
our
umbrellas
in
the
rack
and
so
i
guess
whatever
he
took
my
sister
maymie
madest
him
give
it
back
lines
wrote
whilst
from
an
accident
caused
by
a
hornet
o
hornet
when
i
what
thou
canst
do
to
make
strong
men
just
hump
themselves
and
run
men
who
wouldst
boldly
face
a
gun
but
lack
the
to
halt
whilst
you
pursue
and
thy
stinger
something
they
wouldst
rue
wondered
if
when
things
that
weigh
a
ton
flee
from
thy
wrath
thou
dost
not
deem
it
fun
to
chase
folks
that
are
so
much
bigger
you
didst
i
to
my
size
possess
the
means
for
even
thou
dost
own
be
great
sport
to
tackle
well
i
guess
a
boy
any
size
and
hear
him
moan
as
i
didst
when
thou
gavest
me
that
caress
from
something
hotter
than
the
torrid
zone
lines
wrote
on
a
summer
day
whilst
of
a
when
a
man
i
shalt
not
care
to
be
the
president
of
these
united
states
rather
be
the
clerk
who
waits
on
people
at
the
he
hast
lots
more
fun
it
seems
to
me
for
whilst
the
public
dost
not
get
rebates
on
soda
he
canst
get
it
at
cut
rates
and
lots
of
times
bet
he
gets
it
free
of
course
i
know
it
must
be
pretty
fine
to
hear
the
brass
bands
and
the
big
bass
drums
come
by
the
white
house
all
in
line
and
the
hero
comes
and
yet
no
presidential
job
in
mine

one
that
gets
the
plums
lines
wrote
after
scolded
for
not
as
children
used
to
i
to
live
to
be
ten
times
as
old
as
wast
mathusalem
the
patriarch
then
when
some
older
person
durst
remark
i
wast
young
the
children
so
bold
and
always
loved
to
do
as
they
wert
told
and
went
to
bed
soon
after
it
wast
dark
say
to
him
my
friend
now
hark
to
one
who
wilt
no
longer
hear
thee
scold
i
knew
thy
when
they
wert
sly
youngsters
their
poor
nurse
and
children
now
art
good
as
they
wert
then
they
always
have
been
stubborn
mean
perverse
and
always
wilt
be
since
alas
like
men
just
as
heaven
makes
them
only
worse
lines
wrote
on
how
cleopatra
made
men
act
very
foolish
i
readst
in
an
old
history
book
how
cleopatra
used
to
make
men
do
just
any
fool
thing
that
she
wanted
to
by
them
a
look
time
wast
long
long
ago
when
have
shook
my
head
and
saidst
the
story
wast
not
true
but
that
alas
that
wast
before
i
knew
miss
susan
who
hast
my
fancy
took
i
hadst
an
apple
have
not
let
any
boy
in
school
taste
but
when
she
asked
couldst
she
have
a
bite
and
took
a
lot
i
didst
not
mind
at
all
for
oh
to
me
where
she
hadst
bit
hadst
somehow
made
the
spot
taste
awful
sweet
thus
dost
love
rule
us

sonnet
wrote
whilst
what
i
wouldst
do
with
gold
o
great
carnegie
with
thy
wealth
oh
my
i
dost
not
know
exactly
what
do
but
to
me
have
more
fun
than
you
art
with
it
anyhow
if
i
hadst
money
as
they
say
burn
try
to
burn
it
here
for
oh
make
me
blue
to
think
have
to
smell
it
through
the
endless
eons
of
the
by
and
by
and
you
can
bet
if
i
hadst
gold
in
bins
as
thou
hast
got
in
quantities
so
vast
thou
canst
not
spend
it
buy
diamond
pins
and
soda
water
to
the
very
last
and
be
sorry
that
i
wast
not
twins
so
i
couldst
spend
my
fortune
twice
as
fast
some
thoughts
thought
whilst
to
bathe
in
a
i
like
in
a
say
no
more
like
a
good
old
where
you
can
dive
right
in
and
splash
and
roll
or
anything
you
please
than
like
play
some
afternoon
of
a
hot
summer
day
when
thou
from
school
and
poky
things
hast
stole
oh
it
good
for
heart
and
brain
and
soul
to
plunge
right
in
and
swim
your
own
sweet
way
i
pity
folks
who
bathe
where
they
must
wear
a
i
wouldst
have
none
in
mine
give
me
a
good
old
shady
corner
where
what
i
call
and
when
i
bathe
in
this
affair
the
the
thing
for
which
i
pine
lines
wrote
in
school
whilst
glances
at
susan
sanderson
what
is
love
the
poet
asks
i
guess
better
tell
him
when
a
cheeks
seem
as
to
you
as
and
though
and
freckled
more
or
less
still
the
phantom
of
pure
loveliness
that
ever
and
anon
athwart
your
dream
comes
whilst
you
scheme
and
scheme
and
scheme
to
be
where
she
is
thou
in
love
oh
yes
when
you
keep
how
squeeze
her
hand
if
sometime
thou
couldst
be
her
little
glove
and
if
thou
feelst
that
thou
wouldst
like
to
stand
with
only
just
the
frosty
stars
above
in
some
big
snowdrift
her
window
and
stay
there
forever
then
thou
art
in
love
thoughts
thought
whilst
the
lawn
on
a
saturday
afternoon
o
circus
day
so
very
brief
art
thou
from
early
morn
when
first
doth
rise
the
tent
till
midnight
comes
and
all
the
show
hath
went
thou
like
a
swiftly
dream
oh
how
i
wish
the
tasks
that
wet
the
brow
with
sweat
is
what
i
meant
would
haste
as
thou
dost
haste
how
different
this
world
wouldst
be
from
what
we
find
it
now
or
be
better
still
if
time
wouldst
pass
whilst
at
the
antics
of
the
clown
as
slow
as
the
sands
within
the
glass
whilst
i
sun
that
almost
melts
me
down
must
mow
the
lawn
o
fate
why
must
alas
thy
smile
be
so
much
shorter
than
thy
frown
sonnet
wrote
on
the
of
my
grammar
school
hours
o
education
maybe
thou
art
all
our
teachers
tell
us
but
just
let
me
say
that
if
my
folks
wouldst
let
me
have
my
way
from
early
spring
till
frost
comes
in
the
fall
be
outdoors
you
bet
ball
or
otherwise
each
fine
day
it
a
shame
for
boys
to
have
to
stay
like
culprits
shut
in
by
a
prison
wall
i
guess
if
you
get
rich
folks
wilt
not
care
if
you
know
your
grammar
to
a
t
for
baby
boys
find
everywhere
art
named
for
uncles
who
hast
money
see
though
they
got
no
they
canst
spare
nor
never
spell
their
with
a
thoughts
thought
on
folks
find
fault
with
the
weather
i
love
cold
winter
weather
with
the
snow
on
the
walks
i
hast
to
clear
and
frost
nose
and
cheek
and
ear
with
the
thermometer
i
also
love
the
summer
when
so
that
clothes
next
to
you
all
and
frantic
pretty
near
and
things
that
hot
folks
dost
you
know
i
love
both
seasons
but
i
wish
i
could
enjoy
them
whilst
with
us
for
you
see
winter
when
the
summer
so
good
and
summer
when
the
winter
pleases
me
but
somehow
i
have
never
understood
why
either
of
them
whilst
lines
wrote
after
hamlet
from
an
upper
gallery
o
shakespeare
thou
all
the
world
dost
think
hast
written
some
good
things
i
too
wouldst
pay
my
best
respects
to
thee
yet
wouldst
i
say
that
whilst
i
like
thee
yet
i
dost
not
shrink
from
thee
that
thou
art
on
the
and
very
sadly
out
of
date
still
if
follow
my
advice
thou
may
still
count
as
one
of
us
and
get
more
your
plays
any
good
the
way
they
stand
thou
to
tone
them
up
with
something
nice
some
and
a
bridge
and
chunks
of
ice
wouldst
make
your
old
plays
draw
to
beat
the
band
and
folks
wouldst
crowd
your
show
at
any
price
sonnet
wrote
whilst
retrospectively
my
first
cigar
oh
woe
is
me
and
other
things
like
that
yestreen
i
soughtst
to
smoke
my
first
cigar
it
my
system
a
tremendous
jar
i
didst
not
have
the
gumption
of
a
gnat
all
night
i
couldst
not
tell
where
i
wast
at
i
wish
i
knew
just
what
those
cheap
smokes
are
it
to
me
made
of
glue
and
tar
ah
me
weaker
than
a
cat
oh
let
them
smoke
henceforth
i
who
will
for
who
am
i
that
i
shouldst
dare
condemn
their
vile
tobacco
i
have
hadst
my
fill
let
others
have
it
i
envy
them
for
not
never
smoke
no
more
until
ten
times
older
than
mathusalem
sonnet
wrote
whilst
about
a
vacation
spent
on
a
farm
o
farmer
independentest
of
all
mankind
art
thou
i
know
because
last
year
i
spent
my
whole
vacation
pretty
near
on
uncle
farm
and
though
small
i
hoed
the
corn
and
beans
and
helped
him
haul
and
stack
his
hay
work
until
fear
just
drop
down
and
end
my
sad
career
before
give
the
welcome
dinner
call
my
uncle
dost
not
weigh
his
words
with
care
for
once
he
told
me
that
i
wast
a
shirk
but
i
wouldst
rather
breathe
the
country
air
than
be
a
or
clerk
for
i
found
out
whilst
out
there
that
i
like
but
i
hate
farm
work
lines
composed
after
a
book
full
of
love
letters
one
reason
why
afraid
to
get
so
famous
like
we
poets
always
do
is
that
print
my
spoony
letters
too
as
is
the
way
with
all
of
us
who
let
our
fancies
caper
hadst
i
thought
whilst
yet
unknown
be
a
poet
quite
a
few
words
with
which
i
soughtst
to
woo
more
girls
than
one
not
have
wrote
you
bet
if
susan
sanderson
shouldst
find
i
sent
the
valentine
i
saidst
i
wrote
for
her
to
jane
jones
too
the
thirty
cents
spent
for
soda
wasted
infer
why
must
we
poets
do
things
repent
and
oh
why
thus
didst
me
and
byron
err
sonnet
wrote
after
a
youth
about
o
boy
that
upon
the
deck
and
gotst
thyself
in
our
school
readers
and
the
school
speakers
of
our
land
because
thou
wouldst
not
leave
that
wreck
oh
thou
think
if
thou
hadst
saved
thy
neck
and
wisely
cut
and
run
to
beat
the
band
thou
couldst
have
later
done
things
still
more
grand
alas
too
soon
didst
death
thy
valor
check
oh
didst
thou
stay
because
thou
couldst
not
swim
or
wast
it
fame
for
which
thy
heart
didst
yearn
of
course
thou
gotst
a
name
time
canst
not
dim
but
seemst
to
me
that
all
i
canst
discern
in
thy
foolhardy
whim
is
that
thou
deemed
the
world
hadst
boys
to
burn
