wrong
for

it

the

it
is

prudent
when
nothing
tempts
you
to
stray
when
without
or
within
no
voice
of
sin
is
luring
your
soul
away
but
only
a
negative
virtue
until
it
is
tried
by
fire
and
the
life
that
is
worth
the
honour
on
earth
is
the
one
that
resists
desire
by
the
cynic
the
sad
the
fallen
who
had
no
strength
for
the
strife
the
highway
is
cumbered
they
make
up
the
sum
of
life
but
the
virtue
that
conquers
passion
and
the
sorrow
that
hides
in
a
it
is
these
that
are
worth
the
homage
on
earth
for
we
find
them
but
once
in
a
while
the
house
of
life
all
wondering
and
within
her
portico
i
made
my
plea
to
hostess
life
one
morning
long
ago
show
me
this
great
house
of
thine
nor
close
a
single
door
but
let
me
wander
where
i
will
and
climb
from
floor
to
floor
for
many
rooms
and
curious
things
and
treasures
great
and
small
within
your
spacious
mansion
lie
and
i
would
see
them
then
hostess
life
turned
silently
her
searching
gaze
on
me
and
with
no
word
she
reached
her
hand
and
offered
up
the
key
it
opened
first
the
door
of
hope
and
long
i
lingered
there
until
i
spied
the
room
of
dreams
just
higher
by
a
stair
and
then
a
door
whereon
the
one
word
was
writ
but
when
i
tried
the
little
key
i
could
not
make
it
fit
it
turned
the
lock
of
room
where
first
all
seemed
so
but
after
i
had
stayed
awhile
it
somehow
lost
its
light
and
wandering
down
a
lonely
hall
i
came
upon
a
room
marked
and
i
entered
lose
myself
in
gloom
along
the
shadowy
halls
i
groped
my
weary
way
about
and
found
that
from
dull
room
a
door
of
toil
led
out
it
led
out
to
another
door
whereon
a
crimson
stain
made
sullenly
against
the
dark
these
words
room
of
but
oh
the
light
the
light
the
light
that
spilled
down
from
above
and
upward
wound
the
stairs
of
faith
right
to
the
tower
of
love
and
when
i
came
forth
from
that
place
i
tried
the
little
and
lo
the
door
of
happiness
swung
open
wide
and
free
a
song
of
life
in
the
rapture
of
life
and
of
living
i
lift
up
my
heart
and
rejoice
and
i
thank
the
great
giver
for
giving
the
soul
of
my
gladness
a
voice
in
the
glow
of
the
glorious
weather
in
the
sensuous
air
my
burdens
seem
light
as
a
they
are
nothing
to
bear
in
the
strength
and
the
glory
of
power
in
the
pride
and
the
pleasure
of
wealth
for
who
dares
dispute
me
my
dower
of
talents
and
and
health
i
can
laugh
at
the
world
and
its
i
am
greater
than
seers
who
are
sad
for
he
is
most
wise
in
all
ages
who
knows
how
to
be
glad
i
lift
up
my
eyes
to
apollo
the
god
of
the
beautiful
days
and
my
spirit
soars
off
like
a
swallow
and
is
lost
in
the
light
of
its
rays
are
you
troubled
and
sad
i
beseech
you
come
out
of
the
shadows
of
come
out
in
the
sun
while
i
teach
you
the
secret
of
life
come
out
of
the
above
up
over
its
crosses
and
graves
though
the
green
earth
is
fair
and
i
love
it
we
must
love
it
as
masters
not
slaves
come
up
where
the
dust
never
but
only
the
perfume
of
and
your
life
shall
be
glad
with
surprises
of
beautiful
hours
come
up
where
the
rare
golden
wine
is
apollo
distills
in
my
sight
and
your
life
shall
be
happy
as
mine
is
and
as
full
of
delight
prayer
i
do
not
undertake
to
say
that
literal
answers
come
from
heaven
but
i
know
when
i
pray
a
comfort
a
support
is
given
that
helps
me
rise
earthly
things
as
larks
soar
up
on
airy
wings
in
vain
the
wise
philosopher
points
out
to
me
my
flaws
in
vain
the
scientists
aver
that
things
are
controlled
by
my
life
has
taught
me
day
by
day
that
it
availeth
much
to
pray
i
do
not
stop
to
reason
out
the
why
and
how
i
do
not
care
since
i
know
this
that
when
i
doubt
life
seems
a
blackness
of
despair
the
world
a
tomb
and
when
i
trust
sweet
blossoms
spring
up
in
the
dust
since
i
know
in
the
darkest
hour
if
i
lift
up
my
soul
in
prayer
some
sympathetic
loving
power
sends
hope
and
comfort
to
me
there
since
balm
is
sent
to
ease
my
pain
what
need
to
argue
or
explain
prayer
has
a
sweet
refining
grace
it
educates
the
soul
and
heart
it
lends
a
lustre
to
the
face
and
by
its
elevating
art
it
gives
the
mind
an
inner
sight
that
brings
it
near
the
infinite
from
our
gross
selves
it
helps
us
rise
to
something
which
we
yet
may
be
and
so
i
ask
not
to
be
wise
if
thus
my
faith
is
lost
to
me
faith
that
with
voice
and
touch
says
for
prayer
availeth
in
the
long
run
in
the
long
run
fame
finds
the
deserving
man
the
lucky
wight
may
prosper
for
a
day
but
in
good
time
true
merit
leads
the
van
and
vain
pretence
unnoticed
goes
its
way
there
is
no
chance
no
destiny
no
fate
but
fortune
smiles
on
those
who
work
and
wait
in
the
long
run
in
the
long
run
all
godly
sorrow
pays
there
is
no
better
thing
than
righteous
pain
the
sleepless
nights
the
awful
days
bring
sure
reward
to
tortured
soul
and
brain
unmeaning
joys
enervate
in
the
end
but
sorrow
yields
a
glorious
dividend
in
the
long
run
in
the
long
run
all
hidden
things
are
known
the
eye
of
truth
will
penetrate
the
night
and
good
or
ill
thy
secret
shall
be
known
however
well
guarded
from
the
light
all
the
unspoken
motives
of
the
breast
are
fathomed
by
the
years
and
stand
in
the
long
run
in
the
long
run
all
love
is
paid
by
love
though
undervalued
by
the
hosts
of
earth
the
great
eternal
government
above
keeps
strict
account
and
will
redeem
its
worth
give
thy
love
freely
do
not
count
the
cost
so
beautiful
a
thing
was
never
lost
in
the
long
run
as
you
go
through
life
look
for
the
flaws
as
you
go
through
life
and
even
when
you
find
them
it
is
wise
and
kind
to
be
somewhat
blind
and
look
for
the
virtue
behind
them
for
the
cloudiest
night
has
a
hint
of
light
somewhere
in
its
shadows
hiding
better
by
far
to
hunt
for
a
star
than
the
spots
on
the
sun
abiding
the
current
of
life
runs
ever
away
to
the
bosom
of
great
ocean
set
your
force
the
course
and
think
to
alter
its
motion
waste
a
curse
on
the
universe
remember
it
lived
before
you
butt
at
the
storm
with
your
puny
form
but
bend
and
let
it
go
you
the
world
will
never
adjust
itself
to
suit
your
whims
to
the
letter
some
things
must
go
wrong
your
whole
life
long
and
the
sooner
you
know
it
the
better
it
is
folly
to
fight
with
the
infinite
and
go
under
at
last
in
the
wrestle
the
wiser
man
shapes
into
plan
as
water
shapes
into
a
vessel
two
sunsets
in
the
fair
morning
of
his
life
when
his
pure
heart
lay
in
his
breast
panting
with
all
that
wild
unrest
to
plunge
into
the
great
strife
that
fills
young
hearts
with
mad
desire
he
saw
a
sunset
red
and
gold
the
burning
billows
surged
and
rolled
and
upward
tossed
their
caps
of
fire
he
looked
and
as
he
looked
the
sight
sent
from
his
soul
through
breast
and
brain
such
intense
joy
it
hurt
like
pain
his
heart
seemed
bursting
with
delight
so
near
the
unknown
seemed
so
close
he
might
have
grasped
it
with
his
hands
he
felt
his
inmost
soul
expand
as
sunlight
will
expand
a
rose
one
day
he
heard
a
singing
a
human
voice
in
trills
he
paused
and
little
went
trickling
downward
through
each
vein
and
in
his
heart
the
whole
day
long
as
in
a
temple
veiled
and
dim
he
kept
and
bore
about
with
him
the
beauty
of
that
song
and
then
but
why
relate
what
then
his
smouldering
heart
flamed
into
he
had
his
one
supreme
desire
and
plunged
into
the
world
of
men
for
years
queen
folly
held
her
sway
with
pleasures
of
the
grosser
kind
she
fed
his
flesh
and
drugged
his
mind
till
shamed
he
sated
turned
away
he
sought
his
home
that
hour
triumphant
should
have
been
in
sooth
since
he
went
forth
an
unknown
youth
and
came
back
crowned
with
wealth
and
power
the
clouds
made
day
a
gorgeous
bed
he
saw
the
splendour
of
the
sky
with
unmoved
heart
and
stolid
eye
he
only
knew
the
west
was
red
then
suddenly
a
fresh
young
voice
rose
from
some
hidden
place
he
did
not
even
turn
his
it
struck
him
simply
as
a
noise
he
trod
the
old
paths
up
and
down
their
leaves
by
fall
winds
how
dull
they
dull
the
dull
even
in
the
pulsing
town
o
worst
of
punishments
that
brings
a
blunting
of
all
finer
sense
a
loss
of
feelings
keen
intense
and
dulls
us
to
the
higher
things
o
penalty
most
dire
most
sure
swift
following
after
gross
delights
that
we
no
more
see
beauteous
sights
or
hear
as
hear
the
good
and
pure
o
shape
more
hideous
and
more
dread
than
vengeance
takes
in
minds
this
certain
doom
that
blunts
and
blinds
and
strikes
the
holiest
feelings
dead
unrest
in
the
youth
of
the
year
when
the
birds
were
building
when
the
green
was
showing
on
tree
and
hedge
and
the
tenderest
light
of
all
lights
was
gilding
the
world
from
zenith
to
outermost
edge
my
soul
grew
sad
and
longingly
lonely
i
sighed
for
the
season
of
sun
and
rose
and
i
said
the
summer
and
that
time
only
lies
sweet
contentment
and
blest
with
bee
and
bird
for
her
maids
of
honour
came
princess
summer
in
robes
of
green
and
the
king
of
day
smiled
down
upon
her
and
wooed
her
and
won
her
and
made
her
queen
fruit
of
their
union
and
true
pledges
beautiful
roses
bloomed
day
by
day
and
rambled
in
gardens
and
hid
in
hedges
like
royal
children
in
sportive
play
my
restless
soul
for
a
little
season
revelled
in
rapture
of
glow
and
bloom
and
then
like
a
subject
who
harbours
treason
grew
full
of
rebellion
and
grey
with
gloom
and
i
said
am
sick
of
the
blisses
of
warmth
and
beauty
and
nothing
more
the
full
fruition
my
sad
soul
misses
that
beauteous
holds
in
store
but
now
when
the
colours
are
almost
blinding
burning
and
blending
on
bush
and
tree
and
the
rarest
fruits
are
mine
for
the
finding
and
the
year
is
ripe
as
a
year
can
be
my
soul
complains
in
the
same
old
fashion
crying
aloud
in
my
troubled
breast
is
the
same
old
longing
the
same
old
passion
o
where
is
the
treasure
which
men
call
rest
of
all
the
waltzes
the
great
strauss
wrote
mad
with
melody
from
the
very
first
to
the
final
note
give
me
his
life
it
stirs
my
blood
to
my
thrills
me
and
fills
me
with
vague
unrest
and
all
that
is
sweetest
and
saddest
blends
together
within
my
breast
it
brings
back
that
night
in
the
dim
arcade
in
sweet
morning
and
best
prime
when
the
great
brass
orchestra
played
and
played
and
set
our
thoughts
to
rhyme
it
brings
back
that
winter
of
mad
delights
of
leaping
pulses
and
tripping
feet
and
those
languid
summer
nights
when
we
heard
the
band
in
the
street
it
brings
back
rapture
and
glee
and
glow
it
brings
back
passion
and
pain
and
strife
and
so
of
all
the
waltzes
i
know
give
me
the
for
it
is
so
full
of
the
dear
old
so
full
of
the
dear
old
friends
i
knew
and
under
its
rhythm
and
lilt
and
rhyme
i
am
always
nothing
but
stones
i
think
i
never
passed
so
sad
an
hour
dear
friend
as
that
one
at
the
church
the
edifice
from
basement
to
the
tower
was
one
resplendent
blaze
of
coloured
light
up
through
broad
aisles
the
stylish
crowd
was
thronging
each
richly
robed
like
some
bidden
guest
will
i
bring
my
sorrow
and
my
longing
i
said
here
find
i
heard
the
heavenly
voice
of
thunder
it
seemed
to
give
me
infinite
relief
i
wept
strange
eyes
looked
on
in
wonder
i
dried
my
tears
their
gaze
profaned
my
grief
wrapt
in
the
costly
furs
and
silks
and
laces
beat
alien
hearts
that
had
no
part
with
me
i
could
not
read
in
all
those
proud
cold
faces
one
thought
of
sympathy
i
watched
them
bowing
and
devoutly
kneeling
heard
their
responses
like
sweet
waters
roll
but
only
the
glorious
sacred
pealing
seemed
gushing
from
a
full
and
fervent
soul
i
listened
to
the
man
of
holy
calling
he
spoke
of
creeds
and
hailed
his
own
as
best
of
corruption
and
of
but
naught
that
gave
me
rest
nothing
that
helped
me
bear
the
daily
grinding
of
soul
with
body
heart
with
heated
brain
nothing
to
show
the
purpose
of
this
blinding
and
sometimes
overwhelming
sense
of
pain
and
then
dear
friend
i
thought
of
thee
so
lowly
so
unassuming
and
so
gently
kind
and
lo
a
peace
a
calm
serene
and
holy
settled
upon
my
mind
ah
friend
my
friend
one
true
heart
fond
and
tender
that
understands
our
troubles
and
our
needs
brings
us
more
near
to
god
than
all
the
splendour
and
pomp
of
seeming
worship
and
vain
creeds
one
glance
of
thy
dear
eyes
so
full
of
feeling
doth
bring
me
closer
to
the
infinite
than
all
that
throng
of
worldly
people
kneeling
in
blaze
of
gorgeous
light
inevitable
i
was
so
weary
and
i
lay
in
that
delicious
state
of
when
baby
sitting
with
his
nurse
at
play
cried
loud
for
all
his
toys
forsaking
i
was
so
weary
and
i
needed
rest
and
signed
to
nurse
to
bear
him
from
the
room
then
sudden
rose
and
caught
him
to
my
breast
and
kissed
the
grieving
mouth
and
cheeks
of
bloom
for
swift
as
lightning
came
the
thought
to
me
with
pulsing
and
a
mist
of
tears
of
days
inevitable
that
are
to
be
if
my
fair
darling
grows
to
years
days
when
he
will
not
call
for
when
the
world
with
many
a
pleasure
and
bright
joy
shall
tempt
him
forth
into
the
haunts
of
men
and
i
shall
lose
the
first
place
with
my
boy
when
other
homes
and
loves
shall
give
delight
when
younger
smiles
and
voices
will
seem
best
and
so
i
held
him
to
my
heart
forgetting
all
my
need
of
peace
and
rest
the
ocean
of
song
in
a
land
beyond
sight
or
conceiving
in
a
land
where
no
blight
is
no
wrong
no
darkness
no
graves
and
no
grieving
there
lies
the
great
ocean
of
song
and
its
waves
oh
its
waves
unbeholden
by
any
save
gods
and
their
kind
are
not
blue
are
not
green
but
are
golden
like
moonlight
and
sunlight
combined
it
was
whispered
to
me
that
their
waters
were
made
from
the
tears
that
were
wept
by
the
sons
and
the
daughters
of
eras
and
spheres
like
white
sands
of
heaven
the
spray
is
that
falls
all
the
happy
day
long
and
whoever
it
touches
straightway
is
made
glad
with
the
spirit
of
song
up
up
to
the
clouds
where
their
hoary
crowned
heads
melt
away
in
the
skies
the
beautiful
mountains
of
glory
each
side
of
the
rise
here
day
is
one
splendour
of
of
light
with
beauty
replete
here
night
is
not
night
but
is
twilight
pervading
enfolding
and
sweet
bright
birds
from
all
climes
and
all
regions
that
sing
the
whole
glad
summer
long
are
dumb
till
they
flock
here
in
legions
and
lave
in
the
ocean
of
song
it
is
here
that
the
four
winds
of
heaven
the
winds
that
do
sing
and
rejoice
it
is
here
they
first
came
and
were
given
the
secret
of
sound
and
a
voice
far
down
along
beautiful
beeches
by
night
and
by
glorious
day
the
throng
of
the
gifted
ones
reaches
their
foreheads
made
white
with
the
spray
and
a
few
of
the
sons
and
the
daughters
of
this
kingdom
from
sight
go
down
in
the
wonderful
waters
and
bathe
in
those
billows
of
light
and
their
souls
evermore
are
like
fountains
and
liquid
and
lucent
and
strong
high
over
the
tops
of
the
mountains
gush
up
the
sweet
billows
of
song
no
of
waters
can
dry
them
whoever
has
bathed
in
that
sea
all
dangers
all
deaths
they
defy
them
and
are
gladder
than
gods
are
with
glee
might
have
we
will
be
what
we
could
be
do
not
say
might
have
been
had
not
or
that
or
no
fate
can
keep
us
from
the
chosen
way
he
only
might
who
we
will
do
what
we
could
do
do
not
dream
chance
leaves
a
hero
all
uncrowned
to
grieve
i
hold
all
men
are
greatly
what
they
seem
he
does
who
could
achieve
we
will
climb
where
we
could
climb
tell
me
not
of
adverse
storms
that
kept
thee
from
the
height
what
eagle
ever
missed
the
peak
he
sought
he
always
climbs
who
might
i
do
not
like
the
phrase
might
have
been
it
lacks
all
force
and
best
truths
perverts
for
i
believe
we
have
and
reach
and
win
whatever
our
deserts
momus
god
of
laughter
though
with
gods
the
world
is
cumbered
gods
unnamed
and
gods
unnumbered
never
god
was
known
to
be
who
had
not
his
devotee
so
i
dedicate
to
mine
here
in
verse
my
not
ares
mars
who
can
give
success
in
wars
not
morpheus
who
doth
keep
guard
above
us
while
we
sleep
not
venus
she
whose
duty
to
give
us
love
and
beauty
hail
to
these
and
others
after
momus
gleesome
god
of
laughter
quirinus
would
guard
my
health
plutus
would
insure
me
wealth
mercury
looks
after
trade
hera
smiles
on
youth
and
maid
all
are
kind
i
own
their
worth
after
momus
god
of
mirth
though
apollo
out
of
spite
hides
away
his
face
of
light
though
minerva
looks
askance
deigning
me
no
smiling
glance
kings
and
queens
may
envy
me
while
i
claim
the
god
of
glee
wisdom
wearies
love
has
wealth
makes
burdens
pleasure
stings
glory
proves
a
thorny
so
all
gifts
the
gods
throw
down
bring
their
pains
and
troubles
after
all
save
momus
god
of
laughter
he
alone
gives
constant
joy
hail
to
momus
happy
boy
i
dream
oh
i
have
dreams
i
sometimes
dream
of
life
in
the
full
meaning
of
that
splendid
word
its
subtle
music
which
few
men
have
heard
though
all
may
hear
it
sounding
through
strife
its
mountain
heights
by
mystic
breezes
kissed
lifting
their
lovely
peaks
above
the
dust
its
treasures
which
no
touch
of
time
can
rust
its
emerald
seas
its
dawns
of
amethyst
its
certain
purpose
its
serene
repose
its
usefulness
that
finds
no
hour
for
woes
this
is
my
dream
of
life
yes
i
have
dreams
i
ofttimes
dream
of
love
as
radiant
and
brilliant
as
a
star
as
changeless
too
as
that
fixed
light
afar
which
glorifies
vast
worlds
of
space
above
strong
as
the
tempest
when
it
holds
its
breath
before
it
bursts
in
fury
and
as
deep
as
the
unfathomed
seas
where
lost
worlds
sleep
and
sad
as
birth
and
beautiful
as
death
as
fervent
as
the
fondest
soul
could
crave
yet
holy
as
the
moonlight
on
a
grave
this
is
my
dream
of
love
yes
yes
i
dream
one
dream
is
beautiful
and
comforting
and
blest
complete
with
certain
promises
of
rest
divine
content
and
ecstasy
supreme
when
that
strange
essence
author
of
all
faith
that
subtle
something
which
cries
for
the
light
like
a
lost
child
who
wanders
in
the
night
shall
solve
the
mighty
mystery
of
death
shall
find
eternal
progress
or
sublime
and
satisfying
slumber
for
all
time
this
is
my
dream
of
death
the
sonnet
alone
it
stands
in
fair
land
a
temple
by
the
muses
set
apart
a
perfect
structure
of
consummate
art
by
artists
builded
and
by
genius
planned
beyond
the
reach
of
the
apprentice
hand
beyond
the
ken
of
the
untutored
heart
like
a
fine
carving
in
a
common
mart
only
the
favoured
few
will
understand
a
toiled
over
with
great
care
yet
which
the
unseeing
careless
crowd
goes
by
a
plainly
set
but
solitaire
an
ancient
bit
of
pottery
too
rare
to
please
or
hold
aught
save
the
special
eye
these
only
with
the
sonnet
can
compare
the
past
fling
my
past
behind
me
like
a
robe
worn
threadbare
in
the
seams
and
out
of
date
i
have
outgrown
it
wherefore
should
i
weep
and
dwell
up
on
its
beauty
and
its
dyes
of
oriental
splendour
or
complain
that
i
must
needs
discard
it
i
can
weave
upon
the
shuttles
of
the
future
years
a
fabric
far
more
durable
subdued
it
may
be
in
the
blending
of
its
hues
where
sombre
shades
commingle
yet
the
gleam
of
golden
warp
shall
shoot
it
through
and
through
while
over
all
a
fadeless
lustre
lies
and
starred
with
gems
made
out
of
crystalled
tears
my
new
robe
shall
be
richer
than
the
old
a
dream
that
was
a
curious
dream
i
thought
the
three
great
planets
that
are
drawing
near
the
sun
with
such
unerring
certainty
begun
to
talk
together
in
a
mighty
glee
they
spoke
of
vast
convulsions
which
would
be
throughout
the
solar
rare
fun
of
watching
haughty
stars
drop
one
by
one
and
vanish
in
a
seething
vapour
sea
i
thought
i
heard
them
comment
on
the
that
small
dark
beyond
a
doubt
they
wondered
if
live
creatures
moved
about
its
tiny
surface
deeming
it
of
worth
and
then
they
such
a
singing
shout
that
i
awoke
and
joined
too
in
their
mirth
uselessness
let
mine
not
be
that
saddest
fate
of
all
to
live
beyond
my
greater
self
to
see
my
faculties
decaying
as
the
tree
stands
stark
and
helpless
while
its
green
leaves
fall
let
me
hear
rather
the
imperious
call
which
all
men
dread
in
my
glad
morning
time
and
follow
death
ere
i
have
reached
my
prime
or
drunk
the
strengthening
cordial
of
gall
the
stroke
or
the
fierce
tempest
blast
which
fells
the
green
tree
to
the
earth
is
kinder
than
the
calm
that
lets
it
last
unhappy
witness
of
its
own
decay
may
no
man
ever
look
on
me
and
say
lives
but
all
her
usefulness
is
will
there
is
no
chance
no
destiny
no
fate
can
circumvent
or
hinder
or
control
the
firm
resolve
of
a
determined
soul
gifts
count
for
nothing
will
alone
is
great
all
things
give
way
before
it
soon
or
late
what
obstacle
can
stay
the
mighty
force
of
the
river
in
its
course
or
cause
the
ascending
orb
of
day
to
wait
each
soul
must
win
what
it
deserves
let
the
fool
prate
of
luck
the
fortunate
is
he
whose
earnest
purpose
never
swerves
whose
slightest
action
or
inaction
serve
the
one
great
aim
why
even
death
stands
still
and
waits
an
hour
sometimes
for
such
a
will
winter
rain
falling
upon
the
frozen
world
last
i
heard
the
slow
beat
of
the
winter
poor
foolish
drops
all
in
vain
the
earth
but
mocked
their
puny
might
far
better
had
the
fixedness
of
white
and
uncomplaining
make
no
sign
but
coldly
smile
when
pitying
moonbeams
concealed
its
sorrow
from
all
human
sight
long
long
ago
in
blurred
and
burdened
years
i
learned
the
uselessness
of
uttered
woe
though
sinewy
fate
deals
her
most
skilful
blow
i
do
not
waste
the
gall
now
of
my
tears
but
feed
my
pride
upon
its
bitter
while
i
look
straight
in
the
bold
eyes
and
smile
life
life
like
a
romping
schoolboy
full
of
glee
doth
bear
us
on
his
shoulder
for
a
time
there
is
no
path
too
steep
for
him
to
climb
with
strong
lithe
limbs
as
agile
and
as
free
as
some
young
roe
he
speeds
by
vale
and
sea
by
flowery
mead
by
mountain
peak
sublime
and
all
the
world
seems
motion
set
to
rhyme
till
tired
out
he
cries
carry
me
in
vain
we
murmur
life
says
play
and
seizes
on
us
god
he
goads
us
so
he
does
not
let
us
sit
down
all
the
day
at
each
new
step
we
feel
the
burden
grow
till
our
bent
backs
seem
breaking
as
we
go
watching
for
death
to
meet
us
on
the
way
burdened
a
weapon
a
dear
god
there
is
no
sadder
fate
in
life
than
to
be
burdened
so
that
you
can
not
sit
down
contented
with
the
common
lot
of
happy
mother
and
devoted
wife
to
feel
your
brain
wild
and
your
bosom
rife
with
all
the
commotion
to
be
fraught
with
fires
and
frenzies
which
you
have
not
sought
and
weighed
down
with
the
wild
weary
strife
to
feel
a
fever
always
in
your
breast
to
lean
and
hear
half
in
affright
half
shame
a
public
boldly
mouth
your
name
to
reap
your
harvest
in
unrest
and
know
however
great
your
meed
of
fame
you
are
but
a
weak
woman
at
the
best
let
them
go
let
the
dream
go
are
there
not
other
dreams
in
vastness
of
clouds
hid
from
thy
sight
that
yet
shall
gild
with
beautiful
gold
gleams
and
shoot
the
shadows
through
and
through
with
light
what
matters
one
lost
vision
of
the
night
let
the
dream
go
let
the
hope
set
are
there
not
other
hopes
that
yet
shall
rise
like
new
stars
in
thy
sky
not
long
a
soul
in
sullen
darkness
gropes
before
some
light
is
lent
it
from
on
high
what
folly
to
think
happiness
gone
by
let
the
hope
set
let
the
joy
fade
are
there
not
other
joys
like
bulbs
that
yet
shall
start
and
bloom
severe
must
be
the
winter
that
destroys
the
hardy
roots
locked
in
their
silent
tomb
what
cares
the
earth
for
her
brief
time
of
gloom
let
the
joy
fade
let
the
love
die
are
there
not
other
loves
as
beautiful
and
full
of
sweet
unrest
flying
through
space
like
doves
they
yet
shall
come
and
nestle
in
thy
breast
and
thou
shalt
say
of
each
this
is
best
let
the
love
die
five
kisses
the
kiss
i
love
breathed
a
secret
to
her
listening
heart
and
said
though
she
guarded
it
and
dwelt
as
one
within
a
world
apart
yet
sun
and
star
seemed
by
that
secret
lit
and
where
she
passed
each
whispering
wind
ablow
and
every
little
blossom
in
the
sod
called
joyously
to
her
know
we
know
for
are
we
not
the
intimates
of
god
life
grew
so
radiant
and
so
opulent
that
when
her
fragile
body
and
her
brain
by
mortal
throes
of
agony
were
rent
she
felt
a
curious
rapture
in
her
pain
then
after
anguish
came
the
supreme
they
brought
the
little
baby
for
her
kiss
the
betrothal
ii
there
was
a
little
pause
between
the
dances
without
somewhere
a
tinkling
fountain
played
the
dusky
path
was
lit
by
ardent
glances
as
forth
they
fared
a
lover
and
a
maid
he
chose
a
nook
from
curious
eyes
well
all
redolent
with
sweet
midsummer
charm
and
by
the
great
primeval
instinct
bidden
he
drew
her
in
the
shelter
of
his
arm
the
words
that
long
deep
in
his
heart
had
trembled
found
sudden
utterance
she
at
first
dissembled
refused
her
lips
and
half
withdrew
her
hand
then
murmured
and
yielded
woman
fashion
her
virgin
mouth
to
young
kiss
of
passion
the
bridal
kiss
iii
as
fleecy
clouds
trail
back
across
the
skies
showing
the
sweet
young
moon
in
azure
space
the
lifted
veil
revealed
her
shining
a
sudden
wonder
to
his
eager
eyes
in
that
familiar
beauty
lurked
surprise
for
now
the
wife
stood
in
the
with
conscious
dignity
and
grace
and
large
pride
grown
trebly
fair
and
wise
the
world
receded
leaving
them
alone
the
universe
was
theirs
from
sphere
to
sphere
and
life
assumed
new
meaning
and
new
worth
love
held
no
privilege
they
did
not
own
and
when
they
kissed
each
other
without
fear
they
understood
why
god
had
made
the
earth
domestic
bliss
iv
sequestered
in
their
calm
domestic
bower
they
sat
together
he
in
prime
and
she
a
matron
in
her
fullest
flower
the
mantel
clock
gave
forth
a
warning
chime
she
put
her
work
aside
his
bright
cigar
grew
pale
and
crumbled
in
an
ashen
heap
the
lights
went
out
save
one
remaining
star
that
watched
beside
the
children
in
their
sleep
she
hummed
a
little
song
and
nestled
near
as
side
by
side
they
went
to
their
repose
his
arm
about
her
waist
he
whispered
and
pressed
his
lips
upon
her
full
the
sacred
sweetness
of
their
wedded
life
breathed
in
that
kiss
of
husband
and
of
wife

islands
of
a
vanished
past
appear
bringing
forgotten
names
and
faces
near
while
lost
in
mist
the
present
fades
away
the
fragrant
winds
of
tender
memories
blow
across
the
gardens
of
the
they
smile
into
each
eyes
and
see
the
bride
and
bridegroom
of
the
long
ago
and
tremulous
lips
pressed
close
to
faded
cheek
silent
tale
of
deathless
passion
speak
retrospection
i
look
down
the
lengthening
distance
far
back
to
valley
of
hope
how
strange
seemed
the
ways
of
existence
how
infinite
life
and
its
scope
what
dreams
what
ambitions
came
thronging
to
people
a
world
of
my
own
how
the
heart
in
my
bosom
was
longing
for
pleasures
and
places
unknown
but
the
of
pleasure
and
beauty
were
covered
with
mist
at
the
dawn
and
only
the
rugged
road
duty
shone
clear
as
my
feet
wandered
on
i
loved
not
the
path
and
its
leading
i
hated
the
rocks
and
the
dust
but
a
voice
from
the
silence
was
pleading
it
spoke
but
one
i
saw
as
the
morning
grew
older
the
fair
flowered
hills
of
delight
and
the
feet
of
my
comrades
grew
bolder
they
hurried
away
from
my
sight
and
when
on
the
pathway
i
faltered
and
when
i
rebelled
at
my
fate
the
voice
with
assurance
unaltered
again
spoke
one
along
the
hard
highway
i
travelled
and
saw
with
dim
vision
how
soon
the
gold
locks
were
unravelled
by
fingers
of
amorous
noon
a
turn
in
the
pathway
of
i
stood
in
the
perfect
prime
close
close
to
the
hillside
of
beauty
the
voice
from
the
silence
said
the
road
to
the
beautiful
regions
lies
ever
through
hard
way
oh
ye
who
go
searching
in
legions
know
this
and
be
patient
helena
last
night
i
saw
helena
she
whose
praise
of
late
all
men
have
sounded
she
for
whom
young
angus
rashly
sought
a
silent
tomb
rather
than
live
without
her
all
his
days
wise
men
go
mad
who
look
upon
her
long
she
is
so
ripe
with
dangers
yet
meanwhile
i
find
no
fascination
in
her
smile
although
i
make
her
theme
of
this
poor
song
golden
tresses
yes
they
may
be
fair
and
yet
to
me
each
shining
silken
tress
seems
robbed
of
beauty
and
all
too
many
hands
have
stroked
hair
i
know
a
little
maiden
so
demure
she
will
not
let
her
one
true
hands
in
playful
fondness
touch
her
soft
brown
bands
so
is
she
and
so
pure
great
dark
eyes
that
flash
like
gems
at
night
large
eyes
and
lustrous
that
may
be
and
yet
they
are
not
beautiful
to
me
too
many
hearts
have
sunned
in
their
delight
i
mind
me
of
two
tender
blue
eyes
hid
so
underneath
white
curtains
and
so
veiled
that
i
have
sometimes
plead
for
hours
and
failed
to
see
more
than
the
shyly
lifted
lid
perfect
mouth
so
liked
a
carved
kiss
where
hearts
do
drown
i
would
not
taste
its
sweetness
for
a
crown
too
many
lips
have
drank
its
nectared
bliss
i
know
a
mouth
whose
virgin
dew
undried
lies
like
a
young
bloom
untouched
and
sweet
and
though
i
plead
in
passion
at
her
feet
she
would
not
let
me
brush
it
if
i
died
in
vain
helena
though
wise
men
may
vie
for
thy
rare
smile
or
die
from
loss
of
it
armoured
by
my
sweet
trust
i
sit
and
know
thou
are
not
worth
her
faintest
sigh
nothing
remains
nothing
remains
of
unrecorded
ages
that
lie
in
the
silent
cemetery
time
their
wisdom
may
have
shamed
our
wisest
sages
their
glory
may
have
been
indeed
sublime
how
weak
do
seem
our
strivings
after
power
how
poor
the
grandest
efforts
of
our
brains
if
out
of
all
we
are
in
one
short
hour
nothing
remains
nothing
remains
but
the
eternal
spaces
time
and
decay
uproot
the
forest
trees
even
the
mighty
mountains
leave
their
places
and
sink
their
haughty
heads
beneath
strange
seas
the
great
earth
writhes
in
some
convulsive
spasms
and
turns
the
proudest
cities
into
plains
the
level
sea
becomes
a
yawning
nothing
remains
nothing
remains
but
the
eternal
forces
the
sad
seas
cease
complaining
and
grow
dry
rivers
are
drained
and
altered
in
their
courses
great
stars
pass
out
and
vanish
from
the
sky
ideas
die
and
old
religions
perish
our
rarest
pleasures
and
our
keenest
pains
are
swept
away
with
all
we
hate
or
nothing
remains
nothing
remains
but
the
eternal
nameless
and
spirit
of
the
law
uncomprehended
comprehensive
blameless
invincible
resistless
with
no
flaw
so
full
of
love
it
must
create
for
ever
destroying
that
it
may
create
again
persistent
and
perfecting
in
endeavour
it
yet
must
bring
forth
angels
after
this
this
remains
comrades
i
and
my
soul
are
alone
all
in
the
shining
weather
we
were
sick
of
the
world
and
put
it
away
so
we
could
rejoice
together
our
host
the
sun
in
the
blue
blue
sky
is
mixing
a
rare
sweet
wine
in
the
burnished
gold
of
this
cup
on
high
for
me
and
this
soul
of
mine
we
find
it
a
safe
and
royal
drink
and
a
cure
for
every
pain
it
helps
us
to
love
and
helps
us
to
think
and
strengthens
body
and
brain
and
sitting
here
with
my
soul
alone
where
the
yellow
fall
of
all
the
friends
i
have
ever
known
i
find
it
the
of
all
we
rarely
meet
when
the
world
is
near
for
the
world
hath
a
pleasing
art
and
brings
me
so
much
that
is
bright
and
dear
that
my
soul
it
keepeth
apart
but
when
i
grow
weary
of
mirth
and
glee
of
glitter
glow
and
splendour
like
a
tried
old
friend
it
comes
to
me
with
a
smile
that
is
sad
and
tender
and
we
walk
together
as
two
friends
may
and
laugh
and
drink
wine
oh
a
royal
comrade
any
day
i
find
this
soul
of
mine
what
gain
now
while
thy
rounded
cheek
is
fresh
and
fair
while
beauty
lingers
laughing
in
thine
eyes
ere
thy
young
heart
shall
meet
the
stranger
or
thy
blithe
soul
become
the
home
of
sighs
were
it
not
kindness
should
i
give
thee
rest
by
plunging
this
sharp
dagger
in
thy
breast
dying
so
young
with
all
thy
wealth
of
youth
what
part
of
life
wouldst
thou
not
claim
in
sooth
only
the
woe
sweetheart
that
sad
souls
know
now
in
this
sacred
hour
of
supreme
trust
of
pure
delight
and
palpitating
joy
ere
change
can
come
as
come
it
surely
must
with
jarring
doubts
and
discords
to
destroy
our
far
too
perfect
peace
i
pray
thee
sweet
were
it
not
best
for
both
of
us
and
meet
if
i
should
bring
swift
death
to
seal
our
bliss
dying
so
full
of
joy
what
could
we
miss
nothing
but
tears
sweetheart
and
weary
years
how
slight
the
action
just
one
blow
here
where
i
feel
thy
warm
pulsing
beat
and
then
another
through
my
own
and
so
our
perfect
union
would
be
made
complete
so
past
all
parting
i
should
claim
thee
mine
dead
with
our
youth
and
faith
and
love
divine
should
we
not
keep
the
best
of
life
that
way
what
shall
we
gain
by
living
day
on
day
what
shall
we
gain
sweetheart
but
bitter
pain
to
the
west
in
an
interview
with
lawrence
barrett
he
said
literature
of
the
new
world
must
look
to
the
west
for
its
not
to
the
crowded
east
where
in
a
groove
like
the
harnessed
wheel
of
a
great
machine
the
trammelled
mind
must
where
thought
must
follow
the
fashion
of
thought
or
be
counted
vulgar
and
set
at
naught
not
to
the
languid
south
where
the
mariners
of
the
brain
are
lured
by
the
sirens
of
the
sense
and
wrecked
upon
its
where
thought
is
rocked
on
the
sweet
breath
to
a
torpid
sleep
that
ends
in
death
but
to
the
mighty
west
that
chosen
realm
of
god
where
nature
reaches
her
hands
to
men
and
freedom
walks
where
mind
is
king
and
fashion
is
naught
there
shall
the
new
world
look
for
thought
to
the
west
the
beautiful
west
she
shall
look
and
not
in
for
out
of
its
broad
and
boundless
store
come
muscle
and
nerve
and
brain
let
the
bards
of
the
east
and
the
south
be
for
out
of
the
west
shall
the
poets
come
they
shall
come
with
souls
as
great
as
the
cradle
where
they
were
rocked
they
shall
come
with
brows
that
are
touched
with
fire
like
the
gods
with
whom
they
have
walked
they
shall
come
from
the
west
in
royal
state
the
singers
and
thinkers
for
whom
we
wait
the
land
of
content
i
set
out
for
the
land
of
content
by
the
gay
crowded
with
laughter
and
jesting
i
went
with
the
throng
for
a
day
then
i
knew
i
had
wandered
astray
for
i
met
returned
pilgrims
belated
who
said
are
weary
and
sated
but
we
found
not
the
land
of
i
turned
to
the
steep
path
of
fame
i
said
is
over
yon
this
land
with
the
beautiful
ambition
will
lend
me
its
but
i
paused
in
my
journey
ere
night
for
the
way
grew
so
lonely
and
troubled
i
anxiety
is
not
the
road
to
then
i
joined
the
great
rabble
and
throng
that
frequents
the
moneyed
mart
but
the
greed
and
the
grasping
and
wrong
left
me
only
one
depart
and
sickened
and
saddened
at
heart
i
hurried
away
from
the
gateway
for
my
soul
and
my
spirit
said
straightway
is
not
the
road
to
then
weary
in
body
and
brain
an
overgrown
path
i
detected
and
i
said
will
hide
with
my
pain
in
this
byway
unused
and
lo
it
led
to
the
realm
god
selected
to
crown
with
his
best
gifts
of
beauty
and
through
the
dark
pathway
of
duty
i
came
to
the
land
of
content
warning
high
in
the
heavens
i
saw
the
moon
this
morning
albeit
the
sun
shone
bright
unto
my
soul
it
spoke
in
voice
of
warning
night
after
the
battles
are
over
read
at
reunion
of
the
madison
july
after
the
battles
are
over
and
the
war
drums
cease
to
beat
and
no
more
is
heard
on
the
hillside
the
sound
of
hurrying
feet
full
many
a
noble
action
that
was
done
in
the
days
of
strife
by
the
soldier
is
half
forgotten
in
the
peaceful
walks
of
life
just
as
the
tangled
grasses
in
warmth
and
light
grow
over
the
graves
of
the
fallen
and
hide
them
away
from
sight
so
many
an
act
of
valour
and
many
a
deed
sublime
fade
from
the
mind
of
the
soldier
by
the
grass
of
time
not
so
should
they
be
rewarded
those
noble
deeds
of
old
they
should
live
for
ever
and
ever
when
the
hearts
are
cold
then
rally
ye
brave
old
comrades
old
veterans
reunite
uproot
tangled
live
over
the
march
and
the
fight
let
grant
come
up
from
the
white
house
and
clasp
each
hand
first
chieftain
of
the
army
last
chieftain
of
the
land
let
him
rest
from
a
burdens
and
go
in
thought
with
his
men
through
the
fire
and
smoke
of
shiloh
and
save
the
day
again
this
silent
hero
of
battles
knew
no
such
word
as
defeat
it
was
left
for
the
learning
along
with
the
he
was
not
given
to
talking
but
he
found
that
guns
would
preach
in
a
way
that
was
more
convincing
than
fine
and
flowery
speech
three
cheers
for
the
grave
commander
of
the
grand
old
tennessee
who
won
the
first
great
gained
the
first
great
victory
his
motto
was
always
was
his
countersign
and
it
took
all
summer
he
kept
fighting
upon
let
sherman
the
stern
old
general
come
rallying
with
his
men
let
them
march
once
more
through
georgia
and
down
to
the
sea
again
oh
that
grand
old
tramp
to
savannah
three
hundred
miles
to
the
coast
it
will
live
in
the
heart
of
the
nation
for
ever
its
pride
and
boast
as
sheridan
went
to
the
battle
when
a
score
of
miles
away
he
has
come
to
the
feast
and
banquet
by
the
iron
horse
its
pace
is
not
much
swifter
than
the
pace
of
that
famous
steed
which
bore
him
down
to
the
contest
and
saved
the
day
by
his
speed
then
go
over
the
ground
boys
tread
each
remembered
spot
it
will
be
a
gleesome
journey
on
the
feet
of
thought
you
can
fight
a
bloodless
battle
you
can
skirmish
along
the
route
but
not
worth
while
to
forage
there
are
rations
enough
without
start
if
you
hear
the
cannon
it
is
not
the
sound
of
doom
it
does
not
call
to
the
to
the
smoke
and
gloom
us
have
peace
was
spoken
and
lo
peace
ruled
again
and
now
the
nation
is
shouting
through
the
voice
o
boys
who
besieged
old
vicksburgh
can
time
wash
away
the
triumph
of
her
surrender
nine
years
ago
can
you
ever
forget
the
moment
when
you
saw
the
flag
of
white
that
told
how
the
grim
old
city
had
fallen
in
her
might
ah
a
bold
brave
army
when
the
boys
with
a
right
good
will
went
gaily
marching
and
singing
to
the
fight
at
champion
hill
they
met
with
a
warm
reception
but
the
soul
of
john
was
abroad
on
that
field
of
battle
and
our
flag
did
not
go
down
come
heroes
of
look
out
mountain
of
corinth
and
donelson
of
kenesaw
and
atlanta
and
tell
how
the
day
was
won
hush
bow
the
head
for
a
there
are
those
who
can
not
come
no
can
arouse
no
sound
of
fife
or
drum
oh
boys
who
died
for
the
country
oh
dear
and
sainted
dead
what
can
we
say
about
you
that
has
not
once
been
said
whether
you
fell
in
the
contest
struck
down
by
shot
and
shell
or
pined
the
hand
of
sickness
or
starved
in
the
prison
cell
we
know
that
you
died
for
freedom
to
save
our
land
from
shame
to
rescue
a
perilled
nation
and
we
give
you
deathless
fame
the
cause
of
truth
and
justice
that
you
fought
and
perished
for
and
we
say
it
oh
so
gently
boys
who
died
in
the
saviours
of
our
republic
heroes
who
wore
the
blue
we
owe
the
peace
that
surrounds
and
our
strength
to
you
we
owe
it
to
you
that
our
banner
the
fairest
flag
in
the
world
is
unstained
unsullied
on
the
summer
air
unfurled
we
look
on
its
stripes
and
spangles
and
our
hearts
are
filled
the
while
with
love
for
the
brave
commanders
and
the
boys
of
the
rank
and
file
the
grandest
deeds
of
valour
were
never
written
out
the
noblest
acts
of
virtue
the
world
knows
nothing
about
and
many
a
private
soldier
who
walks
his
humble
way
with
no
sounding
name
or
title
unknown
to
the
world
in
the
eyes
of
god
is
a
hero
as
worthy
of
the
bays
as
any
mighty
general
to
whom
the
world
gives
praise
brave
men
of
a
mighty
army
we
extend
you
hand
i
speak
for
the
women
those
pillars
of
our
land
we
wish
you
a
hearty
welcome
we
are
proud
that
you
gather
here
to
talk
of
old
times
together
on
this
brightest
day
in
the
year
and
if
peace
whose
pinions
brood
over
our
land
should
ever
again
go
from
us
god
grant
she
may
ever
stay
should
our
nation
call
in
her
peril
for
hundred
thousand
more
the
loyal
women
would
hear
her
and
send
you
out
as
before
we
would
bring
out
the
treasured
knapsack
we
would
take
the
sword
from
the
wall
and
hushing
our
own
pleadings
hear
only
the
call
for
next
to
our
god
is
our
nation
and
we
cherish
the
honoured
name
of
the
bravest
of
all
brave
armies
who
fought
for
that
fame
and
they
are
dumb
i
have
been
across
the
bridges
of
the
years
wet
with
tears
were
the
ties
on
which
i
trod
going
back
down
the
track
to
the
valley
where
i
left
skies
of
truth
my
lost
youth
as
i
went
i
dropped
my
burdens
one
and
let
them
fall
all
my
sorrows
all
my
wrinkles
all
my
care
my
white
hair
i
laid
down
like
some
lone
heavy
pack
by
the
track
as
i
neared
the
happy
valley
with
light
feet
my
heart
beat
to
the
rhythm
of
a
song
i
used
to
know
long
ago
and
my
spirits
gushed
and
bubbled
like
a
fountain
down
a
mountain
on
the
border
of
that
valley
i
found
you
tried
and
true
and
we
wandered
through
the
golden
hand
in
hand
and
my
pulses
beat
with
rapture
in
the
blisses
of
your
kisses
and
we
met
there
in
those
green
and
verdant
places
smiling
faces
and
sweet
laughter
echoed
upward
from
the
dells
like
gold
bells
and
the
world
was
spilling
over
with
the
glory
of
story
it
was
but
a
journey
of
the
brain
and
again
i
have
left
the
happy
valley
far
behind
and
i
find
time
stands
waiting
with
his
burdens
in
a
pack
for
my
back
as
he
speeds
me
like
a
rough
friend
to
the
end
will
i
find
again
the
lost
ones
loved
so
well
who
can
tell
but
the
dead
know
what
the
life
will
be
to
and
they
are
dumb
night
as
some
dusk
mother
shields
from
all
alarms
the
tired
child
she
gathers
to
her
breast
the
brunette
night
doth
fold
me
in
her
arms
and
hushes
me
to
perfect
peace
and
rest
her
eyes
of
stars
shine
on
me
and
i
hear
her
voice
of
winds
low
crooning
on
my
ear
o
night
o
night
how
beautiful
thou
art
come
fold
me
closer
to
thy
pulsing
heart
the
day
is
full
of
gladness
and
the
light
so
beautifies
the
common
outer
things
i
only
see
with
my
external
sight
and
only
hear
the
great
voice
which
rings
but
silently
from
daylight
and
from
din
the
sweet
night
draws
within
and
looking
as
one
wakened
from
a
dream
i
see
what
longer
what
doth
seem
the
night
says
and
upon
my
ear
revealed
as
are
the
visions
to
my
sight
the
voices
known
as
come
near
and
whisper
of
the
vastly
infinite
great
truth
her
sister
purity
their
brother
honour
all
converse
with
me
and
kiss
my
brow
and
say
brave
of
heart
o
holy
three
how
beautiful
thou
art
the
night
says
sleep
that
thou
arise
strong
for
and
i
feel
her
shadowy
fingers
pressing
on
my
eyes
like
thistledown
i
float
to
the
the
slumberland
made
beautiful
and
bright
as
death
by
dreams
of
loved
ones
gone
from
sight
o
food
for
souls
sweet
dreams
of
pure
delight
how
beautiful
the
holy
hours
of
night
all
for
me
the
world
grows
green
on
a
thousand
by
a
thousand
willows
the
bees
are
humming
and
a
million
birds
by
a
million
rills
sing
of
the
golden
season
coming
but
gazing
out
on
the
lea
and
hearing
a
thrush
and
a
singing
i
feel
that
the
summer
is
all
for
me
and
all
for
me
are
the
joys
it
is
bringing
all
for
me
the
drones
his
song
in
the
perfect
weather
and
just
on
purpose
to
sing
to
me
thrush
and
came
north
together
just
for
me
in
red
and
white
bloom
and
blossom
the
fields
of
clover
and
all
for
me
and
my
delight
the
wild
wind
follows
and
plays
the
lover
the
mighty
sun
with
a
scorching
kiss
i
have
read
and
heard
and
do
not
doubt
it
has
burned
up
a
thousand
worlds
like
this
and
never
stopped
to
think
about
it
and
yet
i
believe
he
hurries
up
just
on
purpose
to
kiss
my
to
drink
the
dew
from
the
and
help
it
to
grow
through
golden
hours
i
know
i
am
only
a
speck
of
dust
an
individual
mite
of
masses
clinging
upon
the
outer
crust
of
a
little
ball
of
cooling
gases
and
yet
and
yet
say
what
you
will
and
laugh
if
you
please
at
my
lack
of
reason
for
me
wholly
and
for
me
still
blooms
and
blossoms
the
summer
season
nobody
else
has
ever
heard
the
story
the
wind
to
me
discloses
and
none
but
i
and
the
can
read
the
hearts
of
the
crimson
roses
ah
my
own
the
world
grows
glad
in
your
smiling
weather
yet
all
for
me
and
me
alone
you
and
your
court
came
north
together
into
space
if
the
sad
old
world
should
jump
a
cog
sometime
in
its
dizzy
spinning
and
go
off
the
track
with
a
sudden
jog
what
an
end
would
come
to
the
sinning
what
a
rest
from
strife
and
the
burdens
of
life
for
the
millions
of
people
in
it
what
a
way
out
of
care
and
worry
and
wear
all
in
a
beautiful
minute
as
the
sun
with
a
curving
sweep
it
hurries
and
runs
and
races
should
it
lose
its
balance
and
go
with
a
leap
into
the
vast
what
a
blest
relief
it
would
bring
to
the
grief
and
the
trouble
and
toil
about
us
to
be
suddenly
hurled
from
the
solar
world
and
let
it
go
on
without
us
with
not
a
sigh
or
a
sad
for
loved
ones
left
behind
us
we
would
go
with
a
lunge
and
a
mighty
plunge
where
never
a
grave
should
find
us
what
a
wild
mad
thrill
our
veins
would
fill
as
the
great
earth
like
a
feather
should
float
through
the
air
to
god
knows
where
and
carry
us
all
together
no
dark
damp
tomb
and
no
gloom
no
tolling
bell
in
the
steeple
but
in
one
swift
breath
a
painless
death
for
a
million
billion
people
what
greater
bliss
could
we
ask
than
this
to
sweep
with
a
free
motion
through
leagues
of
space
to
a
resting
place
in
a
vast
and
vapoury
to
pass
away
from
this
life
for
aye
with
never
a
dear
tie
sundered
and
a
world
on
fire
for
a
funeral
pyre
while
the
stars
looked
on
and
wondered
through
dim
eyes
is
it
the
world
or
my
eyes
that
are
sadder
i
see
not
the
grace
that
i
used
to
see
in
the
whose
song
was
so
glad
or
in
the
boughs
of
the
willow
tree
the
brook
runs
song
seems
lower
and
not
the
song
that
it
sang
of
old
and
the
tree
i
admired
looks
weary
and
tired
of
the
changeless
story
of
heat
and
cold
when
the
sun
goes
up
and
the
stars
go
under
in
that
supreme
hour
of
the
breaking
day
is
it
my
eyes
or
the
dawn
i
wonder
that
finds
less
of
the
gold
and
more
of
the
gray
i
see
not
the
splendour
the
tints
so
tender
the
glory
i
used
to
see
and
i
often
borrow
a
vague
that
another
morning
has
dawned
for
me
when
the
royal
smile
of
that
welcome
comer
beams
on
the
meadow
and
burns
in
the
sky
is
it
my
eyes
or
does
the
summer
bring
less
of
bloom
than
in
days
gone
by
the
beauty
that
thrilled
me
the
rapture
that
filled
me
to
an
overflowing
of
happy
tears
i
pass
unseeing
my
sad
eyes
being
dimmed
by
the
shadow
of
vanished
years
when
the
heart
grows
weary
all
things
seem
dreary
when
the
burden
grows
heavy
the
way
seems
long
thank
god
for
sending
kind
death
as
an
ending
like
a
grand
amen
to
a
minor
song
the
punished
not
they
who
know
the
awful
anguish
not
they
who
while
sad
years
go
by
them
in
the
sunless
cells
of
lonely
prisons
languish
do
suffer
fullest
penalty
for
sin
they
who
walk
the
highways
unsuspected
yet
with
grim
fear
for
ever
at
their
side
who
hug
the
corpse
of
some
sin
undetected
a
corpse
no
grave
or
can
they
who
are
in
their
own
chambers
haunted
by
thoughts
that
like
unbidden
guests
intrude
and
sit
down
uninvited
and
unwanted
and
make
a
nightmare
of
the
solitude
half
fledged
i
feel
the
stirrings
in
me
of
great
things
new
thoughts
rise
up
and
beat
their
wings
and
tremble
on
the
margin
of
their
nest
then
flutter
back
and
hide
within
my
breast
beholding
space
they
doubt
their
untried
strength
beholding
men
they
fear
them
but
at
length
grown
all
too
great
and
active
for
the
heart
that
broods
them
with
such
tender
mother
art
forgetting
fear
and
men
and
all
that
hour
save
the
impelling
consciousness
of
power
that
stirs
within
shall
soar
away
up
to
the
very
portals
of
the
day
oh
what
exultant
rapture
thrills
me
through
when
i
contemplate
all
those
thoughts
may
do
like
eagles
penetrating
space
they
may
explore
full
many
an
unknown
place
and
build
their
nests
on
mountain
heights
unseen
whereon
doth
lie
that
rest
serene
stay
thou
a
little
longer
in
my
breast
till
my
fond
heart
shall
push
thee
from
the
nest
anxious
to
see
thee
soar
to
heights
oh
beautiful
but
thoughts
of
mine
the
year
what
can
be
said
in
new
year
rhymes
not
been
said
a
thousand
times
the
new
years
come
the
old
years
go
we
know
we
dream
we
dream
we
know
we
rise
up
laughing
with
the
light
we
lie
down
weeping
with
the
night
we
hug
the
world
until
it
stings
we
curse
it
then
and
sigh
for
wings
we
live
we
love
we
woo
we
wed
we
wreathe
our
brides
we
sheet
our
dead
we
laugh
we
weep
we
hope
we
fear
and
the
burden
of
the
year
the
unattained
a
vision
beauteous
as
the
morn
with
heavenly
eyes
and
tresses
streaming
slow
glided
a
field
late
shorn
where
walked
a
poet
idly
dreaming
he
saw
her
and
joy
lit
his
face
vanish
not
at
human
speaking
he
cried
form
of
magic
grace
thou
art
the
poem
i
am
seeking
sought
thee
long
i
claim
thee
my
thought
embodied
living
she
shook
the
tresses
from
her
brow
nay
she
said
am
ideal
i
am
the
phantom
of
the
spirit
of
all
great
endeavour
i
am
the
voice
that
says
higher
that
calls
men
up
and
up
for
ever
not
alone
thy
thought
supreme
that
here
upon
thy
path
has
risen
i
am
the
highest
dream
the
ray
of
light
he
can
not
prison
i
am
the
sweet
ecstatic
note
than
all
glad
music
gladder
clearer
that
trembles
in
the
throat
and
dies
without
a
human
hearer
am
the
greater
better
yield
that
leads
and
cheers
thy
farmer
neighbour
for
me
he
bravely
tills
the
field
and
whistles
gaily
at
his
labour
not
thou
alone
o
poet
soul
dost
seek
me
through
an
endless
morrow
but
to
the
toiling
hoping
whole
i
am
at
once
the
hope
and
sorrow
spirit
of
the
unattained
i
am
to
those
who
seek
to
name
me
a
good
desired
but
never
gained
all
shall
pursue
but
none
shall
claim
in
the
crowd
how
happy
they
are
in
all
seeming
how
gay
or
how
smilingly
proud
how
brightly
their
faces
are
beaming
these
people
who
make
up
the
crowd
how
they
bow
how
they
bend
how
they
flutter
how
they
look
at
each
other
and
smile
how
they
glow
and
what
they
utter
but
a
strange
thought
has
found
me
the
while
it
is
odd
but
i
stand
here
and
fancy
these
people
who
now
play
a
part
all
forced
by
some
strange
necromancy
to
speak
and
to
act
from
the
heart
what
a
hush
would
come
over
the
laughter
what
a
silence
would
fall
on
the
mirth
and
then
what
a
wail
would
sweep
after
as
the
sweeps
over
the
earth
if
the
secrets
held
under
and
hidden
in
the
intricate
hearts
of
the
crowd
were
suddenly
called
to
and
bidden
to
rise
up
and
cry
out
aloud
how
strange
one
would
look
to
another
old
friends
of
long
standing
and
own
brothers
would
not
know
each
other
robed
new
in
their
sorrows
and
fears
from
broadcloth
and
velvet
and
laces
would
echo
the
groans
of
despair
and
there
would
be
blanching
of
faces
and
wringing
of
hands
and
of
hair
that
man
with
his
record
of
honour
that
lady
down
there
with
the
rose
that
girl
with
freshness
upon
her
who
knoweth
the
secrets
of
those
smile
on
o
ye
maskers
smile
sweetly
step
lightly
bow
low
and
laugh
loud
though
the
world
is
deceived
and
completely
i
know
ye
o
crowd
i
watch
you
with
infinite
pity
but
play
on
play
ever
your
part
be
gleeful
be
joyful
be
witty
better
than
showing
the
heart
life
and
i
life
and
i
are
lovers
straying
arm
in
arm
along
often
like
two
children
maying
full
of
mirth
and
song
life
plucks
all
the
blooming
hours
growing
by
the
way
binds
them
on
my
brow
like
flowers
calls
me
queen
of
may
then
again
in
rainy
weather
we
sit
planning
work
do
together
in
the
years
to
be
sometimes
life
denies
me
blisses
and
i
frown
or
pout
but
we
make
it
up
with
kisses
ere
the
day
is
out
i
sometimes
grieve
him
try
his
trust
and
faith
saying
i
shall
one
day
leave
him
for
his
rival
death
then
he
always
grows
more
zealous
tender
and
more
true
loves
the
more
for
being
jealous
as
all
lovers
do
though
i
swear
by
stars
above
him
and
by
worlds
beyond
that
i
love
him
though
my
heart
is
fond
though
he
gives
me
doth
my
lover
kisses
with
each
i
shall
one
day
throw
him
over
and
plight
troth
with
death
guerdon
upon
the
white
cheek
of
the
cherub
year
i
saw
a
tear
alas
i
murmured
that
the
year
should
borrow
so
soon
a
sorrow
just
then
the
sunlight
fell
with
sudden
flame
the
tear
became
a
wondrous
diamond
sparkling
in
the
a
beauteous
sight
upon
my
soul
there
fell
such
woeful
loss
i
said
cross
is
grievous
for
a
life
as
young
as
just
then
like
wine
sunlight
shone
from
his
high
heavens
down
and
lo
a
crown
gleamed
in
the
place
of
what
i
thought
a
my
guerdon
snowed
under
of
a
thousand
things
that
the
year
snowed
the
busy
old
year
who
has
gone
how
many
will
rise
in
the
spring
i
wonder
brought
to
life
by
the
sun
of
may
will
the
branches
so
wholly
hidden
that
never
a
seems
to
be
at
the
sweet
call
come
forth
unbidden
and
bud
in
beauty
and
bloom
for
me
will
the
fair
green
earth
whose
throbbing
bosom
is
hid
like
a
in
her
gown
at
night
wake
out
of
her
sleep
and
with
blade
and
blossom
gem
her
garments
to
please
my
sight
over
the
knoll
in
the
valley
yonder
the
loveliest
buttercups
bloomed
and
grew
when
the
snow
has
gone
that
drifted
them
under
will
they
shoot
up
sunward
and
bloom
anew
when
wild
winds
blew
and
a
pelted
i
lost
a
jewel
of
priceless
worth
if
i
walk
that
way
when
snows
have
melted
will
the
gem
gleam
up
from
the
bare
brown
earth
i
laid
a
love
that
was
dead
or
dying
for
the
year
to
bury
and
hide
from
sight
but
out
of
a
trance
will
it
waken
crying
and
push
to
my
heart
like
a
leaf
to
the
light
under
the
snow
lie
things
so
hopes
ambitions
and
dreams
of
faces
that
vanished
and
trusts
that
perished
never
to
sparkle
and
glow
again
the
old
year
greedily
grasped
his
plunder
and
covered
it
over
and
hurried
away
of
the
thousand
things
that
he
did
i
wonder
how
many
will
rise
at
the
call
of
may
o
wise
young
year
with
your
hands
held
under
your
mantle
of
ermine
tell
me
pray
toward
even
when
the
day
leans
down
to
kiss
the
upturned
face
of
night
out
just
beyond
the
town
i
know
a
spot
of
calm
delight
like
crimson
arrows
from
a
quiver
the
red
rays
pierce
the
waters
flowing
while
we
go
dreaming
singing
rowing
to
the
hills
like
some
glad
send
back
our
laughter
and
our
singing
while
yet
more
faint
is
heard
the
steeple
bells
all
sweetly
ringing
some
message
did
the
winds
deliver
to
each
glad
heart
that
august
night
all
heard
but
all
heard
not
aright
by
night
falls
as
in
some
foreign
clime
between
the
hills
that
slope
and
rise
so
dusk
the
shades
at
we
could
not
see
each
eyes
we
only
saw
the
moonbeams
quiver
far
down
upon
the
stream
that
night
the
new
moon
gave
but
little
light
by
how
dusky
were
those
paths
that
led
up
from
the
river
to
the
hall
the
tall
trees
branching
overhead
invite
the
early
shades
that
fall
in
all
the
glad
blithe
world
oh
never
were
hearts
more
free
from
care
than
when
we
wandered
through
those
walks
we
ten
by
so
soon
so
soon
the
changes
came
this
august
day
we
two
alone
on
that
same
river
not
the
same
dream
of
a
night
for
ever
flown
strange
distances
have
come
to
sever
the
hearts
that
gaily
beat
in
pleasure
long
miles
we
can
not
cross
or
from
pluck
two
leaves
dear
friend
the
green
the
russet
seems
it
strange
so
soon
so
soon
the
leaves
can
change
ah
me
so
runs
all
life
away
this
chills
me
and
i
shiver
the
is
almost
past
one
more
the
last
to
little
blue
hood
every
morning
and
every
night
there
passes
our
window
near
the
street
a
little
girl
with
an
eye
so
bright
and
a
cheek
so
round
and
a
lip
so
sweet
the
daintiest
jauntiest
little
miss
that
ever
any
one
longed
to
kiss
she
is
neat
as
wax
and
fresh
to
view
and
her
look
is
wholesome
and
clean
and
good
whatever
her
gown
her
hood
is
blue
and
so
we
call
her
our
blue
hood
for
we
know
not
the
name
of
the
dear
little
lass
but
we
call
to
each
other
to
see
her
pass
blue
hood
is
coming
now
and
we
watch
from
the
window
while
she
goes
by
she
has
such
a
bonny
smooth
white
brow
and
a
fearless
look
in
her
eye
and
a
certain
dignity
wedded
to
grace
seems
to
envelop
her
form
and
face
every
morning
in
sun
or
rain
she
walks
by
the
window
with
sweet
grave
air
and
never
guesses
behind
the
pane
we
two
are
watching
and
thinking
her
fair
lovingly
watching
her
down
the
street
dear
little
blue
hood
bright
and
sweet
somebody
ties
that
hood
of
blue
under
the
face
so
fair
to
see
somebody
loves
her
beside
we
two
somebody
kisses
we
dear
little
blue
hood
fresh
and
fair
are
you
glad
we
love
you
or
you
care
no
spring
up
from
the
south
come
the
birds
that
were
banished
frightened
away
by
the
presence
of
frost
back
to
the
vale
comes
the
verdure
that
vanished
back
to
the
forest
the
leaves
that
were
lost
over
the
hillside
the
carpet
of
splendour
folded
through
winter
spring
spreads
down
again
along
the
horizon
the
tints
that
were
tender
lost
hues
of
burn
bright
as
then
only
the
high
summits
are
hoary
to
the
river
the
sun
gives
a
key
once
more
the
gleaming
shore
lists
to
the
story
told
by
an
amorous
sea
all
things
revive
that
in
winter
time
perished
the
rose
buds
again
in
the
light
the
sun
all
that
was
beautiful
all
that
was
cherished
sweet
things
and
dear
things
and
all
one
late
when
the
year
and
the
roses
were
lying
low
with
the
ruins
of
summer
and
bloom
down
in
the
dust
fell
a
love
that
was
dying
and
the
snow
piled
over
it
and
made
it
a
tomb
lo
now
the
roses
are
budded
for
lo
now
the
summer
is
risen
again
why
dost
thou
bud
not
o
love
of
my
bosom
why
dost
thou
rise
not
and
thrill
me
as
then
life
without
love
is
a
year
without
summer
heart
without
love
is
a
wood
without
song
rise
then
revive
then
thou
indolent
comer
why
dost
thou
lie
in
the
dark
earth
so
long
rise
ah
thou
not
the
that
sheddest
its
beautiful
leaves
in
the
springtime
may
bloom
but
of
cold
things
the
coldest
of
dead
things
the
deadest
love
buried
once
rises
not
from
the
tomb
green
things
may
grow
on
the
hillside
and
heather
birds
seek
the
forest
and
build
there
and
sing
all
things
revive
in
the
beautiful
weather
but
unto
a
dead
love
there
cometh
no
spring
midsummer
after
the
may
time
and
after
the
june
time
rare
with
blossoms
and
perfumes
sweet
cometh
the
round
royal
noon
time
the
red
midsummer
of
blazing
heat
when
the
sun
like
an
eye
that
never
closes
bends
on
the
earth
its
fervid
gaze
and
the
winds
are
still
and
the
crimson
roses
droop
and
wither
and
die
in
its
rays
unto
my
heart
has
come
that
season
o
my
lady
my
worshipped
one
when
over
the
stars
of
pride
and
reason
sails
cloudless
noonday
sun
like
a
great
red
ball
in
my
bosom
burning
with
fires
that
nothing
can
quench
or
tame
it
glows
till
my
heart
itself
seems
turning
into
a
liquid
lake
of
flame
the
hopes
half
shy
and
the
sighs
all
tender
the
dreams
and
fears
of
an
earlier
day
under
the
royal
splendour
droop
like
roses
and
wither
away
from
the
hills
of
doubt
no
winds
are
blowing
from
the
isle
of
pain
no
breeze
is
sent
only
the
sun
in
a
white
heat
glowing
over
an
ocean
of
great
content
sink
o
my
soul
in
this
golden
glory
die
o
my
heart
in
thy
for
the
autumn
must
come
with
its
mournful
story
and
midsummer
will
fade
too
soon
a
reminiscence
i
saw
the
wild
kissing
a
rose
a
wee
one
that
grows
down
low
on
the
bush
where
her
sisters
above
can
not
see
all
done
as
the
moments
roll
on
nor
hear
all
the
whispers
and
murmurs
of
love
they
flaunt
out
their
beautiful
leaves
in
the
sun
and
they
flirt
every
one
with
the
wild
bees
who
pass
and
the
gay
butterflies
and
that
wee
thing
in
why
they
never
once
think
that
won
a
lover
right
under
their
eyes
it
reminded
me
kate
of
a
know
when
you
were
so
petite
then
your
dresses
were
short
and
your
feet
were
so
small
your
sisters
and
they
set
their
caps
for
me
after
that
ball
how
the
blue
eyes
and
black
eyes
smiled
up
in
my
face
a
race
till
that
day
when
you
opened
the
door
in
the
hall
and
looked
up
and
looked
down
with
your
sweet
eyes
of
brown
and
seemed
so
tiny
and
felt
so
tall
your
sisters
had
sent
you
to
keep
me
my
dear
till
they
should
appear
then
you
were
dismissed
like
a
child
in
disgrace
how
meekly
you
went
but
your
brown
eyes
they
sent
a
thrill
to
my
heart
and
a
flush
to
my
face
we
always
were
meeting
some
way
after
that
you
hung
up
my
hat
and
got
it
again
when
i
finished
my
call
sixteen
and
sweet
oh
those
cute
little
feet
shall
i
ever
forget
how
they
tripped
down
the
hall
shall
i
ever
forget
the
first
kiss
by
the
door
or
the
vows
murmured
or
the
rage
and
surprise
of
how
swiftly
time
flows
and
who
would
suppose
that
a
could
have
carried
me
so
far
away
a
faith
across
the
miles
that
stretch
between
through
days
of
gloom
or
glad
sunlight
there
shines
a
face
i
have
not
seen
which
yet
doth
make
my
world
more
bright
he
may
be
near
he
may
be
far
or
near
or
far
i
can
not
see
but
faithful
as
the
morning
star
he
yet
shall
rise
and
come
to
me
what
though
fate
leads
us
separate
ways
the
world
is
round
and
time
is
fleet
a
journey
of
a
few
brief
days
and
face
to
face
we
two
shall
meet
shall
meet
beneath
arching
skies
while
suns
shall
blaze
or
stars
shall
gleam
and
looking
in
each
eyes
shall
hold
the
past
but
as
a
dream
but
round
and
perfect
and
complete
life
like
a
star
shall
climb
the
height
as
we
two
press
with
willing
feet
together
toward
the
infinite
and
still
behind
the
space
between
as
back
of
dawns
the
sunbeams
play
there
shines
the
face
i
have
not
seen
whose
smile
shall
wake
my
world
two
one
leaned
on
velvet
cushions
like
a
to
see
him
pass
the
hero
of
an
hour
whom
men
called
great
she
bowed
with
languid
mien
and
smiled
and
blushed
and
knew
her
power
one
trailed
her
tinselled
garments
through
the
street
and
thrust
aside
the
crowd
and
found
a
place
so
near
the
blooded
prancing
feet
cast
sparks
of
fire
upon
her
painted
face
one
took
the
blossoms
from
her
breast
and
tossed
them
down
as
he
went
riding
by
and
blushed
to
see
them
fondly
pressed
to
bearded
lips
while
eye
spoke
unto
eye
one
bold
and
hardened
with
her
sinful
life
yet
shrank
and
shivered
painfully
because
his
cruel
glance
cut
keener
than
a
knife
the
glance
of
him
who
made
her
what
she
was
one
was
observed
and
lifted
up
to
fame
because
the
hero
smiled
upon
her
while
one
who
was
shunned
and
hated
found
her
shame
in
basking
in
the
of
his
smile
slipping
away
slipping
away
out
of
our
brief
year
slips
the
may
and
winter
lingers
and
summer
flies
and
sorrow
abideth
and
pleasure
dies
and
the
days
are
short
and
the
nights
are
long
and
little
is
right
and
much
is
wrong
slipping
away
is
the
summer
time
it
has
lost
its
rhythm
and
lilting
for
the
grace
goes
out
of
the
day
so
soon
and
the
tired
head
aches
in
the
glare
of
noon
and
the
way
seems
long
to
the
hills
that
lie
under
the
calm
of
the
western
sky
slipping
away
are
the
friends
whose
worth
lent
a
glow
to
the
sad
old
earth
one
by
one
they
slip
from
our
sight
one
by
one
their
graves
gleam
white
or
we
count
them
lost
by
the
crueller
death
of
a
trust
betrayed
or
a
murdered
faith
slipping
away
are
the
hopes
that
made
bliss
out
of
sorrow
and
sun
out
of
shade
slipping
away
is
our
hold
on
life
and
out
of
the
struggle
and
wearing
strife
from
joys
that
diminish
and
woes
that
increase
we
are
slipping
away
to
the
shores
of
peace
is
it
done
it
is
done
in
the
fitful
flashes
the
last
line
has
withered
and
curled
in
a
tiny
white
heap
of
dead
ashes
lie
buried
the
hopes
of
your
world
there
were
mad
foolish
vows
in
each
letter
it
is
well
they
have
shrivelled
and
burned
and
the
ring
oh
the
ring
was
a
fetter
it
was
better
removed
and
returned
but
ah
is
it
done
in
the
embers
where
letters
and
tokens
were
cast
have
you
burned
up
the
heart
that
remembers
and
treasures
its
beautiful
past
do
you
think
in
this
swift
reckless
fashion
to
ruthlessly
burn
and
destroy
the
months
that
were
freighted
with
passion
the
dreams
that
were
drunken
with
joy
can
you
burn
up
the
rapture
of
kisses
that
flashed
from
the
lips
to
the
soul
or
the
heart
that
grows
sick
for
lost
blisses
in
spite
of
its
strength
of
control
have
you
burned
up
the
touch
of
warm
fingers
that
thrilled
through
each
pulse
and
each
vein
or
the
sound
of
a
voice
that
still
lingers
and
hurts
with
a
haunting
refrain
is
it
done
is
the
life
drama
ended
you
have
put
all
the
lights
out
and
yet
though
the
curtain
rung
down
has
descended
can
the
actors
go
home
and
forget
ah
no
they
will
turn
in
their
sleeping
with
a
strange
restless
pain
in
their
hearts
and
in
darkness
and
anguish
and
weeping
will
dream
they
are
playing
their
parts
a
leaf
somebody
said
in
the
crowd
last
eve
that
you
were
married
or
soon
to
be
i
have
not
thought
of
you
i
believe
since
last
we
parted
let
me
see
five
long
summers
have
passed
since
each
has
been
pleasant
in
its
own
and
you
are
but
one
of
a
dozen
men
who
have
played
the
suitor
a
summer
day
but
nevertheless
when
i
heard
your
name
coupled
with
some
not
my
own
there
burned
in
my
bosom
a
sudden
flame
that
carried
me
back
to
the
day
that
is
flown
i
was
sitting
again
by
the
laughing
brook
with
you
at
my
feet
and
the
sky
above
and
my
heart
was
fluttering
under
your
the
unmistakable
look
of
love
again
your
breath
like
a
south
wind
fanned
my
cheek
where
the
blushes
came
and
went
and
the
tender
clasp
of
your
strong
warm
hand
sudden
thrills
through
my
pulses
sent
again
you
were
mine
by
own
mine
for
ever
by
decree
so
for
a
moment
it
seemed
last
night
when
somebody
mentioned
your
name
to
me
just
for
the
moment
i
thought
you
loving
me
wooing
me
as
of
old
the
tale
remembered
seemed
half
though
i
held
it
lightly
enough
when
told
the
past
seemed
fairer
than
when
it
was
near
as
brighten
when
taking
flight
and
just
for
the
moment
i
held
you
when
somebody
mentioned
your
name
last
night
Ã¦sthetic
in
a
garb
that
was
guiltless
of
colours
she
stood
with
a
dull
listless
a
creature
of
dumps
and
of
dolours
but
most
undeniably
fair
the
folds
of
her
garment
fell
round
her
revealing
the
curve
of
each
limb
well
proportioned
and
graceful
i
found
her
although
quite
alarmingly
slim
from
the
hem
of
her
robe
peeped
one
was
she
down
to
her
feet
and
though
i
could
not
understand
all
she
said
i
could
see
she
was
sweet
impressed
by
her
limpness
and
languor
i
proffered
a
chair
near
at
hand
she
looked
back
a
mild
sort
of
posed
anew
and
continued
to
stand
some
praises
i
next
tried
to
mutter
of
the
fan
that
she
held
to
her
face
she
said
it
was
utter
and
waved
it
with
languishing
grace
i
then
in
a
strain
quite
poetic
begged
her
gaze
on
the
bow
in
the
sky
she
its
curve
was
but
the
was
too
dreadfully
her
lovely
face
lit
by
the
splendour
that
glorified
landscape
and
sea
woke
thoughts
that
were
daring
and
tender
did
thoughts
too
rest
upon
me
tell
me
i
cried
growing
bolder
i
in
your
musings
a
place
yes
she
said
over
her
shoulder
was
thinking
of
nothing
in
poems
of
the
week
sunday
lie
still
and
rest
in
that
serene
repose
that
on
this
holy
morning
comes
to
those
who
have
been
burdened
with
the
cares
which
make
the
sad
heart
weary
and
the
tired
head
ache
lie
still
and
day
of
all
is
best
monday
awake
arise
cast
off
thy
drowsy
dreams
red
in
the
east
behold
the
morning
gleams
monday
goes
so
goes
the
week
dames
say
refreshed
renewed
use
well
the
initial
day
and
see
thy
neighbour
already
seeks
his
labour
tuesday
another
banners
are
another
day
looks
smiling
on
the
world
it
holds
new
laurels
for
thy
soul
to
win
mar
not
its
grace
by
slothfulness
or
sin
nor
sad
away
send
it
to
yesterday
wednesday
unto
the
high
noon
the
morning
hours
do
speed
away
so
soon
and
when
the
noon
is
reached
however
bright
instinctively
we
look
toward
the
night
the
glow
is
lost
once
the
meridian
thursday
so
well
the
week
has
sped
hast
thou
a
friend
go
spend
an
hour
in
converse
it
will
lend
new
beauty
to
thy
labours
and
thy
life
to
pause
a
little
sometimes
in
the
strife
toil
soon
seems
rude
that
has
no
interlude
friday
from
feasts
abstain
be
temperate
and
pray
fast
if
thou
wilt
and
yet
throughout
the
day
neglect
no
labour
and
no
duty
shirk
not
many
hours
are
left
thee
for
thy
and
it
were
meet
that
all
should
be
complete
saturday
now
with
the
almost
finished
task
make
haste
so
near
the
night
thou
hast
no
time
to
waste
post
up
accounts
and
let
thy
eyes
look
for
flaws
and
errors
in
when
labours
cease
how
sweet
the
sense
of
peace
ghosts
there
are
ghosts
in
the
room
as
i
sit
here
alone
from
the
dark
corners
there
they
come
out
of
the
gloom
and
they
stand
at
my
side
and
they
lean
on
my
chair
the
ghost
of
a
hope
that
lighted
my
days
with
a
fanciful
glow
in
her
hand
is
the
rope
that
strangled
her
life
out
hope
was
slain
long
ago
but
her
ghost
comes
with
its
skeleton
face
and
expressionless
eyes
and
it
stands
in
the
light
and
mocks
me
and
jeers
me
with
sobs
and
with
sighs
the
ghost
of
a
joy
a
frail
fragile
thing
and
i
prized
it
too
much
and
the
hands
that
destroy
clasped
it
close
and
it
died
at
the
withering
touch
the
ghost
of
a
love
born
with
joy
reared
with
hope
died
in
pain
and
unrest
but
he
towers
above
all
the
ghost
yet
a
ghost
at
the
best
i
am
weary
and
fain
would
forget
all
these
dead
but
the
gibbering
host
make
my
struggle
in
vain
in
each
shadowy
corner
there
lurketh
a
ghost
fleeing
away
my
thoughts
soar
not
as
they
ought
to
soar
higher
and
higher
on
wings
but
ever
and
often
and
more
and
more
they
are
dragged
down
earthward
by
little
things
by
little
troubles
and
little
needs
as
a
lark
might
be
tangled
among
the
weeds
my
purpose
is
not
what
it
ought
to
be
steady
and
fixed
like
a
star
on
high
but
more
like
a
light
at
sea
hither
and
thither
it
seems
to
sometimes
feeble
and
sometimes
bright
then
suddenly
lost
in
the
gloom
of
night
my
life
is
far
from
my
dream
of
calmly
contented
serenely
glad
but
vexed
and
worried
by
daily
strife
it
is
always
troubled
and
ofttimes
and
the
heights
i
had
thought
i
should
reach
one
day
grow
dimmer
and
dimmer
and
farther
away
my
heart
finds
never
the
rest
its
worldly
striving
its
greed
for
gold
chilled
and
frightened
the
guest
who
sometimes
sought
me
in
days
of
old
and
ever
fleeing
away
from
me
is
the
higher
self
that
i
long
to
be
all
mad
is
mad
as
a
hare
poor
fellow
and
should
be
in
chains
you
say
i
a
doubt
of
your
statement
but
who
mad
i
pray
why
the
world
is
a
great
asylum
and
people
are
all
insane
gone
daft
with
pleasure
or
folly
or
crazed
with
passion
and
pain
the
infant
who
shrieks
at
a
shadow
the
child
with
his
santa
claus
faith
the
woman
who
worships
dame
fashion
each
man
with
his
notions
of
death
the
miser
who
hoards
up
his
earnings
the
spendthrift
who
wastes
them
too
soon
the
scholar
grown
blind
in
his
delving
the
lover
who
stares
at
the
moon
the
poet
who
thinks
life
a
pÃ¦an
the
cynic
who
thinks
it
a
fraud
the
youth
who
goes
seeking
for
pleasure
the
preacher
who
dares
talk
of
god
all
priests
with
their
creeds
and
their
croaking
all
doubters
who
dare
to
deny
the
gay
who
find
aught
to
wake
laughter
the
sad
who
find
aught
worth
a
sigh
whoever
is
downcast
or
solemn
whoever
is
gleeful
and
glad
are
only
the
dupes
of
we
are
all
of
of
us
mad
hidden
gems
we
know
not
what
lies
in
us
till
we
seek
men
dive
for
are
not
found
on
shore
the
hillsides
most
unpromising
and
bleak
do
sometimes
hide
the
go
dive
in
the
vast
ocean
of
thy
mind
o
man
far
down
below
the
noisy
waves
down
in
the
depths
and
silence
thou
mayst
find
rare
pearls
and
coral
caves
sink
thou
a
shaft
into
the
mine
of
thought
be
patient
like
the
seekers
after
gold
under
the
rocks
and
rubbish
lieth
what
may
bring
thee
wealth
untold
reflected
from
the
vastly
infinite
however
dulled
by
earth
each
human
mind
holds
somewhere
gems
of
beauty
and
of
light
which
seeking
thou
shalt
find
the
maiden
he
will
claim
me
for
his
bride
hope
is
strong
and
time
is
fleet
youth
is
fair
and
love
is
sweet
clouds
will
pass
that
fleck
my
sky
he
will
come
back
the
soldier
after
i
have
fought
and
bled
i
shall
go
home
from
the
wars
crowned
with
glory
seamed
with
scars
joy
will
flash
from
some
eye
when
she
greets
me
the
mother
strong
and
sturdy
at
my
side
like
a
staff
supporting
me
will
my
bonnie
baby
be
break
my
rest
then
wail
and
repay
me
fleeting
years
of
time
have
still
the
maiden
is
unwed
all
unknown
the
soldier
lies
buried
under
alien
skies
and
the
son
with
eye
saw
his
mother
starve
and
die
god
in
heaven
dost
thou
on
high
keep
the
promised
over
the
may
hill
all
through
the
night
time
and
all
through
the
day
time
dreading
the
morning
and
dreading
the
night
nearer
and
nearer
we
drift
to
the
may
time
season
of
beauty
and
season
of
blight
leaves
on
the
linden
and
sun
on
the
meadow
green
in
the
garden
and
bloom
everywhere
gloom
in
my
heart
and
a
terrible
shadow
walks
by
me
sits
by
me
stands
by
my
chair
oh
but
the
birds
by
the
brooklet
are
cheery
oh
but
the
woods
show
such
delicate
greens
strange
how
you
droop
and
how
soon
you
are
too
well
i
know
what
that
weariness
means
but
how
could
i
know
in
the
crisp
winter
weather
though
sometimes
i
noticed
a
catch
in
your
breath
riding
and
singing
and
dancing
together
how
could
i
know
you
were
racing
with
death
how
could
i
know
when
we
danced
until
morning
and
you
were
the
gayest
of
all
the
gay
with
only
that
shortness
of
breath
for
a
warning
how
could
i
know
that
you
danced
for
a
shroud
whirling
and
whirling
through
moonlight
and
starlight
rocking
as
lightly
as
boats
on
the
wave
down
in
your
eyes
shone
a
deep
far
light
how
could
i
know
the
light
to
your
grave
day
by
day
day
by
day
nearing
and
nearing
hid
under
greenness
and
beauty
and
bloom
cometh
the
shape
and
the
shadow
fearing
the
may
is
waiting
your
tomb
the
season
of
mirth
and
of
music
is
i
have
danced
my
last
dance
i
have
sung
my
last
song
under
the
violets
under
the
clover
my
heart
and
my
love
will
be
lying
ere
long
foes
thank
fate
for
foes
i
hold
mine
dear
as
valued
friends
he
can
not
know
the
zest
of
life
who
runneth
here
his
earthly
race
without
a
foe
i
saw
a
prize
cried
my
friend
thine
to
claim
without
a
but
ere
i
reached
the
end
i
felt
my
strength
was
giving
out
my
foe
looked
on
the
while
i
ran
a
scornful
triumph
lit
his
eyes
with
that
perverseness
born
in
man
i
nerved
myself
and
won
the
prize
all
blinded
by
the
crimson
glow
of
disguise
i
tempted
fate
knew
thy
weakness
sneered
my
foe
i
saved
myself
and
balked
his
hate
for
half
my
blessings
half
my
gain
i
needs
must
thank
my
trusty
foe
despite
his
envy
and
disdain
he
serves
me
well
i
go
so
may
i
keep
him
to
the
end
nor
may
his
enmity
abate
more
faithful
than
the
fondest
friend
he
guards
me
ever
with
his
hate
friendship
dear
friend
i
pray
thee
if
thou
wouldst
be
proving
thy
strong
regard
for
me
make
me
no
vows
is
not
loving
let
thy
faith
speak
for
thee
swear
not
to
me
that
nothing
can
divide
so
little
such
oaths
mean
but
when
distrust
and
envy
creep
beside
us
let
them
not
come
between
say
not
to
me
the
depths
of
thy
devotion
are
deeper
than
the
sea
but
watch
lest
doubt
or
some
unkind
emotion
embitter
them
for
me
vow
not
to
love
me
ever
and
for
ever
words
are
such
idle
things
but
when
we
differ
in
opinions
never
hurt
me
by
little
stings
sick
of
words
they
are
so
lightly
spoken
and
spoken
are
but
air
rather
feel
thy
trust
in
me
unbroken
than
list
thy
words
so
fair
if
all
the
little
proofs
of
trust
are
heeded
if
thou
art
always
kind
no
sacrifice
no
promise
will
be
needed
to
satisfy
my
mind
two
sat
down
two
sat
down
in
the
morning
time
one
to
sing
and
one
to
spin
all
men
listened
the
song
but
no
one
listened
the
dull
din
the
singer
sat
in
a
pleasant
nook
and
sang
of
a
life
that
was
fair
and
sweet
while
the
spinner
sat
with
a
steadfast
look
busily
plying
her
hands
and
feet
the
singer
sang
on
with
a
rose
in
her
hair
and
all
men
listened
her
dulcet
tone
and
the
spinner
spun
on
with
a
dull
despair
down
in
her
heart
as
she
sat
alone
but
lo
on
the
morrow
no
one
said
aught
of
the
singer
or
what
she
sang
men
were
saying
this
thread
and
loud
the
praise
of
the
spinner
rang
the
world
has
forgotten
the
her
rose
is
faded
her
songs
are
old
but
far
the
ocean
the
fame
yet
is
blazoned
in
lines
of
gold
bound
and
free
come
to
me
love
come
on
the
wings
of
the
wind
fly
as
the
would
fly
to
his
mate
leave
all
your
cares
and
your
sorrows
behind
leave
all
the
fears
of
your
future
to
fate
come
and
our
skies
shall
be
glad
with
the
gold
that
paled
into
gray
when
you
parted
from
me
come
but
remember
that
just
as
of
old
you
must
be
bound
love
and
i
must
be
free
life
has
lost
savour
since
you
and
i
parted
i
have
been
lonely
and
you
have
been
sad
youth
is
too
brief
to
be
come
and
again
let
us
laugh
and
be
glad
lips
should
not
sigh
that
are
fashioned
to
breasts
should
not
ache
that
secrets
have
found
come
but
remember
in
spite
of
all
this
i
must
be
free
love
while
you
must
be
bound
you
must
be
bound
to
be
true
while
you
live
and
i
keep
my
freedom
for
ever
as
now
you
must
ask
only
for
that
which
i
kisses
and
but
never
a
vow
come
i
am
lonely
and
long
for
your
smile
bring
back
the
lost
lovely
summer
to
me
come
but
remember
remember
the
while
that
you
must
be
bound
love
and
i
must
be
free
aquileia
on
the
election
of
the
roman
emperor
maximus
by
the
senate
a
powerful
army
headed
by
the
thracian
giant
maximus
laid
siege
to
aquileia
though
poorly
prepared
for

the
constancy
of
her
citizens
rendered
her
impregnable
the
women
of
aquileia
cut
off
their

for
the

the

our
then
panic
reigned
and
many
a
mournful
sound
hurt
the
cleft
air
for
where
could
ropes
be
found
up
rose
a
roman
mother
tall
was
she
as
her
own
son
a
youth
of
noble
height
a
little
child
was
clinging
to
her
she
loosed
his
twining
arms
and
put
him
down
and
her
dark
eyes
flashed
with
a
sudden
light
how
like
a
queen
she
stood
her
royal
crown
the
rich
dark
masses
of
her
splendid
hair
just
flecked
with
spots
of
sunshine
here
and
there
twined
round
her
brow
like
a
coronet
where
gems
of
gold
lie
bedded
deep
in
jet
she
loosed
the
comb
that
held
the
shining
strands
and
threaded
out
the
meshes
with
her
hands
the
purple
mass
fell
to
her
hem
a
queen
new
clothed
without
her
diadem
she
stood
before
her
subjects
she
cried
me
thy
sword
julianus
and
her
son
unsheathed
the
blade
that
had
not
left
his
side
save
when
it
sought
a
blood
to
shed
awed
by
her
regal
bearing
and
obeyed
with
the
white
beauty
of
her
firm
fair
hand
she
clasped
the
hilt
then
severed
one
by
one
her
purple
tresses
strand
on
strand
free
as
foes
had
fallen
by
that
blade
robbed
of
its
massive
wealth
of
curl
and
coil
yet
like
some
antique
model
rose
her
head
in
all
its
classic
beauty
she
said
and
pointed
to
the
shining
mound
of
hair
makes
swift
answer
to
thy
prayer
chrispinus
quick
now
soldiers
to
thy
toil
forth
from
a
thousand
throats
what
seemed
one
voice
rose
shrilly
filling
all
the
air
with
cheer
quoth
the
foe
enemies
rejoice
well
might
the
thracian
giant
quake
with
fear
for
while
skilled
hands
caught
up
the
gleaming
threads
and
bound
them
into
cords
a
hundred
heads
yielded
their
beauteous
tresses
to
the
sword
and
cast
them
down
to
swell
the
precious
hoard
nor
was
the
noble
sacrifice
in
vain
another
day
beheld
the
giant
slain
wishes
for
a
little
girl
what
would
i
ask
the
kindly
fates
to
give
to
crown
her
life
if
i
could
have
my
way
my
strongest
wishes
would
be
negative
if
they
would
but
obey
give
her
not
greatness
for
great
souls
must
stand
alone
and
lonely
in
this
little
world
cleft
rocks
that
show
the
great
hand
thither
by

hurled
give
her
not
genius
spare
her
the
cruel
pain
of
finding
her
whole
life
a
prey
for
daws
of
hearing
with
quickened
sense
and
burning
brain
the
applause
give
her
not
perfect
gifts
for
then
her
truthful
mirror
would
infuse
her
mind
with
love
for
self
and
for
the
praise
of
men
that
lowers
but
make
her
fair
and
comely
to
the
sight
give
her
more
heart
than
brain
more
love
than
pride
let
her
be
cheerful
bright
some
strong
star
and
guide
not
vainly
questioning
why
she
was
sent
into
this
restless
world
of
toil
and
strife
let
her
go
bravely
on
her
way
content
to
make
the
best
of
life
romney
nay
romney
will
not
hear
you
say
those
words
again
love
you
love
you
sweet
you
are
i
repeat
you
are
no
actor
for
so
grand
a
play
you
love
with
all
your
heart
well
that
may
be
some
cups
are
fashioned
shallow
should
i
try
to
quench
my
thirst
from
one
of
those
when
i
who
have
had
a
full
bowl
proffered
a
new
bowl
brimming
with
a
draught
divine
one
single
taste
thrilled
to
the
think
you
i
even
care
to
bathe
my
lips
with
this
poor
sweetened
water
you
call
wine
and
though
i
spilled
the
nectar
ere
quaffed
and
broke
the
bowl
in
wanton
folly
yet
i
would
die
of
my
thirst
ere
i
would
wet
my
burning
lips
with
any
meaner
draught
so
leave
me
romney
one
who
has
seen
a
play
enacted
by
a
star
can
not
endure
to
see
it
rendered
by
an
amateur
you
know
not
what
love
go
away
my
home
this
is
the
place
that
i
love
the
best
a
little
brown
house
like
a
nest
hid
among
grasses
and
vines
and
trees
summer
retreat
of
the
birds
and
bees
the
tenderest
light
that
ever
was
seen
sifts
through
the
window
sifts
and
quivers
and
flits
and
falls
on
carpets
and
walls
all
through
june
the
west
wind
free
the
breath
of
the
clover
brings
to
me
all
through
the
languid
july
day
i
catch
the
scent
of
the
hay
the
morning
glories
and
scarlet
vine
over
the
doorway
twist
and
twine
and
every
day
when
the
house
is
still
the
comes
to
the
in
the
cunningest
chamber
under
the
sun
i
sink
to
sleep
when
the
day
is
done
and
am
waked
at
morn
in
my
bed
by
a
on
the
roof
better
than
treasures
brought
from
rome
are
the
living
pictures
i
see
at
my
aged
father
with
frosted
hair
and
face
like
a
painting
rare
far
from
the
dust
and
heat
i
get
but
sounds
and
odours
sweet
who
can
wonder
i
love
to
stay
week
after
week
here
hidden
away
in
this
sly
nook
that
i
love
the
the
little
brown
house
like
a
nest

marry
or
not
to
marry

i
am
one
life
for
me
has
just
begun
they
are
older
calmer
wiser
age
should
aye
be
adviser
they
must
yet
dear
me
when
in
eyes
i
see
all
the
world
of
love
there
on
my
six
advisers
turning
i
make
answer
but
harry
is
not
like
most
men
who
marry
has
offered
me
a
prize
life
with
love
means
paradise
without
it
is
not
worth
all
the
foolish
joys
of
so
in
spite
of
all
they
say
i
shall
name
the
wedding
day
an
afternoon
i
am
stirred
by
the
dream
of
an
afternoon
of
a
perfect
it
was
not
june
the
lilt
of
winds
and
the
droning
tune
that
a
busy
city
was
humming
and
a
head
and
lips
like
wine
leaning
out
through
the
for
steps
that
were
maybe
eager
steps
that
were
coming
i
can
see
it
all
as
a
dreamer
the
tender
smile
on
your
lips
that
day
and
the
glow
on
your
cheek
as
we
rode
away
into
the
golden
weather
and
a
shone
in
your
eyes
of
i
swear
there
did
we
drove
down
the
crowded
avenue
out
of
the
town
through
shadowy
lanes
together
drove
out
into
the
that
glowed
with
wonderful
crimson
dyes
and
with
soul
and
spirit
and
heart
and
eyes
we
silently
drank
their
splendour
but
the
golden
glory
that
lit
the
place
was
not
alone
from
the
for
i
saw
in
your
fair
uplifted
face
a
light
that
was
wondrously
tender
i
say
i
saw
it
and
yet
i
ask
myself
in
a
cynical
way
was
it
only
a
part
you
had
learned
to
play
to
see
me
act
the
lover
and
i
curse
myself
for
a
fool
and
yet
i
would
willingly
die
without
one
regret
could
i
bring
back
the
day
whose
sun
has
and
live
it
over
river
and
sea
we
stood
by
the
river
that
swept
in
its
glory
and
grandeur
away
but
never
a
pulse
me
leapt
and
you
wondered
at
me
that
day
we
stood
by
the
lake
as
it
lay
with
its
dimpled
face
turned
to
the
light
was
it
strange
i
had
nothing
to
say
to
so
fair
and
enchanting
a
sight
i
look
on
your
tresses
of
you
are
fair
and
a
thing
to
be
do
you
think
i
am
heartless
and
cold
that
i
look
and
am
wholly
unmoved
one
answer
dear
friend
i
will
make
to
the
questions
your
eyes
ask
of
me
not
of
the
river
or
lake
to
those
who
have
looked
on
the
what
happens
when
thy
hand
touches
mine
through
all
the
mesh
of
intricate
and
interlacÃ¨d
veins
shoot
swift
delights
that
border
on
keen
pains
flesh
thrills
to
thrilling
flesh
when
in
thine
eager
eyes
i
look
to
find
a
comrade
to
my
thought
thy
ready
brain
delves
down
and
makes
its
inmost
meaning
plain
mind
answers
unto
mind
when
hands
and
eyes
are
hid
by
seas
that
roll
wide
wastes
between
us
still
so
near
thou
art
i
count
the
very
pulses
of
thy
heart
soul
speaketh
unto
soul
so
every
law
or
human
or
divine
in
heart
and
brain
and
spirit
makes
thee
mine
possession
that
which
we
had
we
still
possess
though
leaves
may
drop
and
stars
may
fall
no
circumstance
can
make
it
less
or
take
it
from
us
all
in
all
that
which
is
lost
we
did
not
own
we
only
held
it
for
a
a
leaf
by
careless
breezes
blown
no
fate
could
take
our
own
away
i
hold
it
as
a
changeless
law
from
which
no
soul
can
sway
or
swerve
we
have
that
in
us
which
will
draw
we
need
or
most
deserve
even
as
the
magnet
to
the
steel
our
souls
are
to
our
best
desires
the
fates
have
hearts
and
they
can
they
know
what
each
true
life
requires
we
think
we
lose
when
we
most
gain
we
call
joys
ended
ere
begun
when
stars
fade
out
do
skies
complain
or
glory
in
the
rising
sun
no
fate
could
rob
us
of
our
no
circumstance
can
make
it
less
what
time
removes
was
but
a
loan
for
what
was
ours
we
still
possess
by
and
