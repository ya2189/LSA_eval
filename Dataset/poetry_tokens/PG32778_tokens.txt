through

dusty
from

into

grey
town
asleep
under

comes
a

of
quarrelling
after

from

harlequinade
shrilly

down

through

night
they
the
scoffers
the
scornful
of

stride
their
turbulent
flight
the
stars
spin
steel
above
their
heads
in
the
shut
irrevocable
sky
gnarled
tear
to

their
cloaks
of
pageantry
a
wind
blows
bitter
in
the
grey
chills
the
sweat
on
throbbing
cheeks
and
tugs
the
gaudy
rags
away
from
their
lean
bleeding
knees
their
laughter
startles
the
scarlet
dawn
among
a
tangled
spiderwork
of
girdered
steel
and
shrills
forlorn
and
dies
in
the
rasp
of
wheels
whirling
like
gay
prints
that
whirl
in
tatters
of
squalid
gaudiness
borne
with
dung
and
dust
in
the
swirl
of
wind
down
the
endless
street
with
thin
lips
laughing
bitterly
through
the
day
smeared
in
sooty
smoke

pours
from

red
chimney

with
unlustered

men
with
huge
ugly
hands
of
oil
children
impudently
stare
and
point
derisive
hands
only
where
a
barrel
organ
thrills
two
small
girls
to
dance
and
among
the
iron
clatter
spills
a
swiftening
rhythmy
song
they
march
in
velvet
silkslashed
hose
strumming
guitars
and
mellow
lutes
strutting

friday
this
is
the
feast
of
death
we
make
of
our
pain
god
we
worship
the
nails
and
the
rod
and
pain
last
choking
breath
and
the
bleeding
rack
of
the
cross
the
women
have
wept
away
their
tears
with
red
eyes
turned
on
death
and
loss
of
friends
and
kindred
have
left
the
biers
flowerless
and
bound
their
heads
in
their
blank
veils
and
climbed
the
steep
slope
of
golgotha
fails
at
last
the
wail
of
their
bereavement
and
all
the
jagged
world
of
rocks
and
desert
places
stands
before
their
racked
sightless
faces
as
any
silent
this
is
the
feast
of
conquering
death
the
beaten
flesh
worships
the
swishing
rod
the
lacerated
body
bows
to
its
god
adores
the
last
agonies
of
breath
and
one
more
has
joined
the
unnumbered
deathstruck
multitudes
who
with
the
loved
of
old
have
slumbered
ages
long
where
broods
earth
the
beneficent
goddess
the
ultimate
queen
of
quietness
taker
of
all
worn
souls
and
bodies
back
into
the
womb
of
her
first
nothingness
but
ours
who
in
the
iron
night
remain
ours
the
need
the
pain
of
his
departing
he
had
lived
on
out
of
a
happier
age
into
our
strident
he
still
could
sing
of
quiet
gardens
under
rain
and
clouds
and
the
huge
sky
and
pale
deliciousness
that
is
nearly
pain
his
was
a
new
minstrelsy
strange
plaints
brought
home
out
of
the
rich
east
twanging
songs
from
tartar
caravans
hints
of
the
sounds
that
ceased
with
the
stilling
dawn
wailings
of
the
night
echoes
of
the
web
of
mystery
that
spans
the
world
between
the
failing
and
the
rising
of
the
wan
daylight
of
the
sea
and
of
a
woman
hair
hanging
gorgeous
down
a
dungeon
wall
evening
falling
on
tintagel
love
lost
in
the
mist
of
old
despair
against
the
bars
of
our
we
beat
out
our
poor
lives
in
vain
we
live
on
cramped
in
an
iron
age
like
prisoners
of
old
high
on
the
world
battlements
exposed
until
we
die
to
the
chilling
rain
crouched
and
chattering
from
cold
for
all
scorn
to
stare
at
and
we
watch
one
by
one
the
great
stroll
leisurely
out
of
the
western
gate
and
without
a
backward
look
at
the
strident
city
drink
down
the
of
fate
embrace
the
last
obscurity

worship
the
nails

welcoming
with
eloquence
outpouring
the

speaking

a
soaring
of
great
phrases
balloons
of
tissue
paper
hung
with
patriotic
bunting
that
rise
serene
into
the
blue
while
the
crowds
with
necks
uptilted
gaze
at
their
upward
soaring
till
they
vanish
in
the
blue
and
each
man
feels
the
blood
of
life
rumble
in
his
ears
important
with
participation
in
events
but
not
the
fluttering
of
great
flags
or
the
brass
bands
blaring
victorious
or
the
speeches
of
persons
in
frock
coats
who
pause
for
the
handclapping
of
crowds
not
the
stamp
of
men
and
women
dancing
or
the
bubbling
of
beer
in
the
taverns
frothy
mugs
free
for
the
victorious
not
all
the
of

drown
the
inextinguishible
laughter
of
the
gods
and
they
hear
it
the
old
hooded
houses
the
great
creaking
houses
that
gossip
and
chuckle
to
each
other
across
the
clattering
streets
they
hear
it
the
old
great
gates
the
grey
gates
with
towers
where
in
the
changing
shrill
winds
of
the
years
have
groaned
the
poles
of
many
banners
the
poplars
of
the
hear
it
from
their
trembling
twigs
comes
a
dry
laughing
as
they
lean
towards
the
glare
of
the
city
and
the
old
old
stones
weary
with
the
weariness
of
the
labor
of
men
footsteps
hear
it
as
they
quake
and
clamour
under
the
garlanded
wheels
of
the
yawning
confident
cannon
that
are
dragged
victorious
through
the
flutter
of

on

is

all
night
in
steaming
bars
in
halls
delirious
with
dancing
that
spill
their
music
into
thronging
streets
all
is
free
to
soldiers
to
the
weary
heroes
who
have
bled
and
soaked
the
whole
earth
in
their
sacrificial
blood
who
have
with
their
bare
flesh
clogged
the
crazy
wheels
of
juggernaut
freed
the
peoples
from
the
dragon
that
devoured
them
that
scorched
with
greed
their
pleasant
fields
and
villages
their
quiet
delightful
places
so
they
of
the

and

victorious
to
the
crowds
in
the
flaring
squares
and
a
murmurous
applause
rises
like
smoke
to
mingle
in
the
sky
with
the
crashing
of
the
bells
but
resounding
in
the
sky
louder
than
the
tramp
of
feet
louder
than
the
crash
of
bells
louder
than
the
blare
of
bands
victorious
shrieks
the
inextinguishable
laughter
of

great
peaked
heads

old
gates
shake
and
the
pavings
ring
with

with
the
iron
tramp
of
old
fighters
as
with
the
clank
of
heels
of
the
victorious
by
long
ages
vanquished
the
spouts
in
the
gurgling
fountains
wrinkle
their
shiny
griffin
faces
splash
the
rhythm
in
their
basins
of
the
inextinguishable
laughter
of
the
gods
and
far
up
into
the
inky
sky
where
great
trailing
clouds
stride
across
the
world
darkening
the
spired
cities
and
the
villages
folded
in
the
hollows
of
hills
and
the
shining
cincture
of
railways
and
the
pale
white
twining
roads
sounds
with
the
stir
of
quiet
monotonous
breath
of
men
and
women
stretched
out
sleeping
sounds
with
the
thin
wail
of
pain
of
hurt
things
huddled
in
darkness
sounds
with
the
victorious
racket
of
speeches
and
soldiers
drinking
sounds
with
the
silence
of
the
swarming
dead
the
inextinguishable
laughter
of
the

curve
their
white
plump
necks
to
the
water
in
the
rivulet

runs
down
the
broad
village

with

up
half
open

extended

takes
the

off
his

sweeping
a
broad
curve
like
a
censor
well
swung

beyond
the
last
grey
gabled
house
in
the
village
the
gaunt
christ

stretches
bony
arms
and
tortured
hands
to
embrace
the
broad
lands
leprous
with
cold
the
furrowed
fields

dining
through

spilling
of
the
wine

after
brimming
glass
to
rouse
the
ghosts
that
dwell
in
books
to
flight

divine
in
the
draining
of
a
glass

tear
the

the

in
gaudy
chaos

the
backs
bowed
under

rulers

a
hall
full
of
the
wine
and
chant
of
old
songs
smelling
of
lilacs
and
early
roses
and
night
clamorous
with
the
names
and
phrases
of
the
throngs
of
the
garlanded
dead
and
with
glasses
pledged
to
the
light
of
the
dawning
to
come
o
in
the
morning
we
would
go
out
into
the
drudging
world
and
sing
and
shout
down
dustblinded
streets
hollo
from
hill
to
hill
and
our
thought
fling
abroad
through
all
the
drowsy
earth
to
wake
the
sleeper
and
the
worker
and
the
jailed
in
walls
cemented
of
lies
to
mirth
and
dancing
joy
laughingly
unveiled
from
the
sick
mist
of
fear
to
run
naked
and
leap
and
shake
the
nations
from
their
snoring
sleep
o
in
the
morning
we
would
go
fantastically
arrayed
in
silk
and
scarlet
braid
in
rich
glitter
like
the
sun
on
snow
with
banners
of
orange
vermillion
black
and
swords
anklets
and
tinkling
gauds
of
topaz
set
twistingly
or
lac
laid
over
with
charms
of
demons
heads
in
indigo
and
gold
our
going
a
music
bold
would
be
behind
us
the
twanging
threads
of
mad
guitars
the
wail
of
lutes
in
wildest
harmony
lilting
thumping
free
pipes
and
kettledrums
and
flutes
and
brazen
braying
would
wake
each
town
and
shake
it
in
laughter
down
untuning
in
dust
the
shuttered
walls
o
in
the
morning
we
would
go
with
doleful
steps
so
dragging
and
slow
and
grievous
mockery
of
woe
and
bury
the
old
gods
where
they
lay
sodden
drunk
with
men
pain
in
the
day
in
the
dawn
first
new
burning
white
ray
that
would
shrivel
like
dead
leaves
the
sacred
lies
the
avengers
the
graspers
the
wringers
of
sighs
of
blood
from
men
hands
from
their
eyes
of
tears
without
hope
but
in
the
burning
day
of
the
dawn
we
would
see
them
brooding
to
slay
in
a
great
wind
whirled
like
dead
leaves
away
in
a
hall
on
olympus
we
held
carouse
in
our
talk
as
banners
waving
names

of
the
garlanded
dead

in

somewhere
is
a

room
my

worked
through
many
lives
to
build
through
the
barred
distorting
windowpanes
i
see
the
new
moon
in
the
sky
when
i
was
small
i
sat
and
drew
endless
pictures
in
all
colors
on
the

tomorrow
the
pictures
should
take
life
i
would
stalk
down
their
long
heroic
colonnades
when

was

a

went
by
the
window
a
red
sunset
threw
her
shadow
on
the
stiff
grey
wall
to
burn
the
colors
of
my
pictures
dead
through
all
these
years
the
walls
have
writhed
with
shadow
overlaid
upon
shadow
i
have
bruised
my
fingers
on
the
windowbars
so
many
lives
cemented
and
made
strong
while
the
bars
stand
strong
outside
the
great
processions
of

lives
go

their

distorted

romantic

the

the

in

dance

fine
acacia

and
flutters
the
cloths
of
the

soar
the
voice
throbs
sugared
into
croaking
base
broken
with
the
burden
of
the
too
ancient
songs
and
yet
beyond
the
flaring
sky
beyond
the
soaring
kites
where
are
no
voices
of
singers
no
strummings
of
guitars
the
untarnished
songs
hang
like
great
moths
just
broken
through
the
dun
threads
of
their
cocoons
moist
motionless
limp
as
flowers
on
the
inaccessible
twigs
of
the
yewtree

you
put

call
to
the

the

flaunt
bravely
their
glory
in
the
sunset
we
will
walk
together
down
the
darkening
streets
beyond
these
tables
and
the
sunset
we
will
hear
the
singing
of
drunken
men
and
the
songs
whores
sing
in
their
doorways
at
night
and
the
endless
soft
crooning
of
all
the
mothers
and
what
words
the
young
men
hum
when
they
walk
beside
the
river
their
arms
hot
with
caresses
their
cheeks
pressed
against
their
girls
cheeks
we
will
lean
very
close
to
the
quiet
lips
of
the
dead
and
feel
in
our
flesh
perhaps
a
flutter
of
wings
as
they
soar
from
us
the
untarnished
songs

the
minstrel
sings
as
the
pennies
clink
love
the
sound
of
the

in

who
will
go
on
a
quest

all
mountain
passes
and
climb
at
last
with
me
among
the
imperishable
branches
of
the

so
that
all
the
limp
unuttered
songs
shall
spread
their
great
and
soar
above
the
craning
necks
of
the
chimneys
above
the
kites
and
the
sunset
above
the
diners
and
their
beat
upward
with
strong
steadily

sails
lean
athwart

shore
their
sails
glow

glint
as
white
as
the
shells
on

beach
and
are
curved
at
the

like
gulls
wings
their
courses
are
set
for
impossible
oceans
where
on
the
gold
imaginary
sands

their
freight
of
very
childish
dreams
dark
on
the

from

faint
creaking

tiny

against
their

to
my
nose
a
smell
of

merchandise
the
wet
familiar
smell
of
harbors
and
the
old
arousing
fragrance
making
the
muscles
ache
and
the
blood
seethe
and
the
eyes
see
the
roadsteads
and
the
golden
beaches
where
with
singing
they
would
furl
the
sails
of
the
schooners
of
childish
dreams
on
icegreen

the
fragrance

old
dreams

smell
from
the
anchored
barges
can
so
fill
my
blood
with
bitterness
that
the
sight
of
the
scudding
moon
makes
my
eyes
tingle
with
salt
tears
in

burst
out

these
stiff

supple
incautious
like
the

spurt
up

their

flames

die
gloriously
in

lean

unimaginable
silent
writhing
of

heavy
fetters
of
