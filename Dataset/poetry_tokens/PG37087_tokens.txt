the

shop
here
in
a
quiet
and
dusty
room
they
lie
faded
as
crumbled
stone
or
shifting
sand
forlorn
as
ashes
shrivelled
scentless
dry
meadows
and
gardens
running
through
my
hand
dead
that
shall
quicken
at
the
call
of

stir
beneath

magic
kiss
though
birds
pass
over
unremembering
and
no
bee
seek
here
roses
that
were
his
in
this
brown
husk
a
dale
of
hawthorn
dreams
a
cedar
in
this
narrow
cell
is
thrust
that
will
drink
deeply
of
a
century
streams
these
lilies
shall
make
summer
on
my
dust
here
in
their
safe
and
simple
house
of
death
sealed
in
their
shells
a
million
roses
leap
here
i
can
blow
a
garden
with
my
breath
and
in
my
hand
a
forest
lies
asleep
man
and
his
makers
i
am
one
of
the
wind
stories
i
am
a
fancy
of
the
rain
a
memory
of
the
high
noon
glories
the
hint
the
sunset
had
of
pain
they
dreamed
me
as
they
dreamed
all
other
hawthorn
and
i
i
and
the
grass
with
sister
shade
and
phantom
brother
across
their
slumber
glide
and
pass
twilight
is
in
my
blood
my
being
mingles
with
trees
and
ferns
and
stones
thunder
and
stars
my
lips
are
freeing
and
there
is
in
my
bones
those
that
have
dreamed
me
shall
me
but
i
go
hence
with
flowers
and
weeds
i
am
no
more
to
those
who
make
me
than
other
drifting
fruit
and
seeds
and
though
i
love
them
mourn
to
leave
them
sea
earth
and
sunset
stars
and
streams
my
tears
my
passing
do
not
grieve
them
other
dreams
have
they
other
dreams
the
new
aspasia
if
i
have
given
myself
to
you
and
you
and
if
these
pale
hands
are
not
virginal
nor
these
bright
lips
beneath
your
own
lips
true
what
matters
it
i
do
not
stand
nor
fall
by
your
old
foolish
judgments
of
desire
if
this
were
helen
way
it
is
not
mine
i
bring
you
beauty
but
no
troys
to
fire
the
cup
i
hold
brims
not
with
borgia
wine
you
so
soon
snared
of
sudden
brows
and
breasts
lightly
you
think
upon
these
lips
this
hair
my
thoughts
are
kinder
you
are
pity
guests
compassion
bed
you
share
it
was
not
lust
delivered
me
to
you
i
gave
my
wondering
mouth
for
pity
sake
for
your
strange
sighing
lips
i
did
but
break
many
times
this
bread
and
poured
this
wine
anew
my
body
woven
sweetness
and
kindling
hair
were
given
for
heal
of
hurts
unknown
of
me
for
something
i
could
slake
but
could
not
share
sudden
and
rough
and
cruel
i
let
you
be
i
gave
my
body
for
what
the
world
calls
sin
even
as
for
your
souls
the
nazarene
gave
once
long
years
in
pity
i
and
he
have
served
you
jesus
and
the
magdalen
as
on
the
river
in
the
fading
light
a
sail
across
the
evening
creeps
torching
the
gloom
and
slowly
sinks
from
sight
the
blood
may
rise
to
some
old
face
at
night
remembering
old
sins
before
it
sleeps
so
might
you
hence
recall
me
were
i
true
to
your
sad
violence
were
i
not
free
so
me
you
might
remember
now
but
you
were
no
more
loved
by
me
than
clouds
at
sunset
or
the
wild
bird
going
about
his
pleasure
on
the
apple
tree
or
roses
swelling
to
the
bee
no
sweeter
than
flowers
suddenly
found
growing
in
dells
or
on
the
bare
high
hills
the
gold
unlaced
daffodils
shouting
the
dawn
or
the
brown
river
flowing
down
quietly
to
the
sea
or
day
in
twilight
hair
bound
safe
and
dim
stirless
in
lavender
or
the
wind
blowing
tumbling
the
poppy
turban
after
him
i
knew
you
as
i
knew
these
happy
things
passing
unwept
on
wide
and
tranquil
wings
to
their
own
place
in
nature
below
above
transient
passion
with
its
stains
and
stings
for
this
strange
pity
that
you
knew
not
of
was
neither
lust
nor
love
do
not
repent
nor
pity
nor
regret
i
do
not
seek
your
pardon
nor
give
you
mine
pass
by
be
silent
drop
no
tears
forget
return
not
make
no
sign
when
i
am
dead
nor
turn
your
lips
away
from
phryne
silver
limbs
and
faustine
kiss
i
need
no
pity
no
word
of
pity
say
i
have
given
a
new
sweet
name
and
crown
to
this
that
served
men
lust
and
was
aspasia
a
song
for
old
love
there
shall
be
a
song
for
both
of
us
that
day
though
fools
say
you
have
long
outlived
your
songs
and
when
perhaps
because
your
hair
is
grey
you
go
unsung
to
whom
all
praise
belongs
and
no
men
kiss
your
hands
your
fragile
hands
folded
like
empty
shells
on
sands
and
you
that
were
dawn
whereat
men
shouted
once
are
sunset
now
with
but
one
worshipper
then
to
your
twilight
heart
this
song
shall
be
sweeter
than
those
that
did
your
youth
announce
for
your
brave
beautiful
spirit
is
lovelier
than
once
your
lovely
body
was
to
me
your
folded
hands
and
your
shut
eyelids
stir
a
passion
that
time
has
crowned
with
sanctity
young
fools
shall
wonder
why
your
youth
being
over
you
are
so
sung
still
but
your
heart
will
know
that
he
who
loved
your
soul
was
your
true
lover
and
the
last
song
alone
was
worthy
you
sic
transit
what
did
she
leave
only
these
hungry
poor
heart
not
did
she
love
did
she
suffer
was
she
sad
from
this
green
bright
and
tossing
world
to
part
no
word
of
do
they
miss
her
do
they
grieve
only
this
for
the
gold
she
had
what
did
she
leave
effingham
swan
song
i
am
growing
old
i
have
kept
youth
too
long
but
i
dare
not
let
them
know
it
now
i
have
done
the
heart
of
youth
a
grievous
wrong
danced
it
to
dust
and
drugged
it
with
the
rose
forced
its
reluctant
lips
to
one
more
vow
i
have
denied
the
lawful
grey
so
kind
so
wise
to
settle
in
my
hair
i
belong
no
more
to
april
but
september
has
not
taught
me
her
repose
i
wish
i
had
let
myself
grow
old
in
the
quiet
way
that
is
so
gracious
i
wish
i
did
not
care
my
faded
mouth
will
never
flower
again
under
the
paint
the
wrinkles
fret
my
eyes
my
hair
is
dull
beneath
its
henna
stain
i
have
come
to
the
last
ramparts
of
disguise
and
now
the
day
draws
on
of
my
defeat
i
shall
not
meet
the
swift
male
glance
across
the
crowded
room
where
the
chance
contact
of
limbs
in
passing
has
its
answer
in
some
future
fierce
embrace
i
shall
sit
there
in
the
corners
looking
on
with
the
older
women
withered
and
overblown
who
have
grown
old
more
graciously
than
i
in
a
sort
of
safe
and
comfortable
tomb
knitting
myself
into
eternity
and
men
will
talk
to
me
because
they
are
kind
or
as
cunning
or
as
courtesy
demands
there
will
be
no
hidden
question
in
their
eyes
and
no
subtle
implication
in
their
hands
and
i
shall
be
so
grateful
who
have
been
so
gracious
and
so
tyrannous
moving
between
denial
and
surrender
i
shall
find
how
women
live
who
have
no
lovers
and
no
answer
for
grey
monotonies
upon
my
table
will
be
no
more
flowers
they
will
bring
me
no
more
flowers
till
i
am
dead
there
will
be
no
violent
sweet
exciting
hours
no
wild
things
done
or
said
yet
sometimes
i
so
tired
of
it
all
this
everlasting
battle
with
the
flesh
this
pitiful
slavery
to
the
body
thrall
and
then
i
do
not
want
to
lure
or
charm
i
want
to
wear
soft
easy
things
be
comfortable
and
warm
i
want
to
drowse
at
leisure
in
my
chair
i
do
not
want
to
wear
a
veil
with
heavy
mesh
or
sit
in
shaded
rooms
afraid
to
face
the
light
i
do
not
want
to
go
out
every
night
and
be
bright
and
vivid
and
intense
nor
be
on
the
alert
and
the
defence
with
other
women
fierce
and
afraid
as
i
drawing
a
knife
unseen
as
each
goes
by
i
am
so
tired
of
men
and
making
love
for
every
one
the
same
there
nothing
new
in
love
beneath
the
sun
all
love
can
say
or
do
has
long
been
said
and
done
i
have
eaten
the
fruit
of
knowledge
long
enough
been
and
why
should
i
try
to
play
still
the
old
foolish
game
because
i
have
played
the
rose
part
too
long
who
plays
the
rose
must
pay
the
rose
price
and
be
a
rose
or
nothing
till
it
dies
and
even
then
sometimes
the
blood
will
answer
fierce
and
strong
to
the
old
hunger
to
the
old
dance
old
tune
i
shall
feel
cruel
and
passionate
and
mad
though
i
have
lost
the
look
of
june
the
fever
of
the
past
will
burn
my
hands
as
men
who
live
long
in
intemperate
lands
feel
the
old
ague
wring
them
far
removed
from
the
old
dreadful
glitter
of
seas
and
sands
the
rose
dies
hard
in
women
who
have
had
lovers
all
their
lives
and
have
been
much
loved
i
am
afraid
to
grow
old
now
even
if
i
would
i
have
fought
too
well
too
long
and
what
was
once
a
foolish
trick
to
make
the
rose
more
strangely
gay
is
now
a
mortal
conflict
of
brain
and
blood
a
feud
too
old
to
settle
or
renounce
i
shall
grow
too
tired
to
struggle
and
the
fight
will
end
and
they
will
enter
in
at
last
nature
and
time
long
thwarted
of
their
prey
those
old
grey
two
more
cruel
for
the
lips
that
said
them
nay
for
the
bitterest
foe
is
he
who
in
the
past
has
been
repulsed
when
he
would
fain
be
friend
i
am
sorry
for
women
who
are
growing
old
i
do
not
blame
them
holding
youth
with
shameful
hold
or
doing
desperate
things
to
lips
and
eyes
they
have
so
pitifully
short
a
flowering
time
so
suddenly
sweet
a
story
so
soon
told
they
only
strive
to
keep
what
men
have
taught
them
most
to
prize
men
who
have
longer
fuller
lives
to
live
who
are
not
stopped
and
broken
in
their
prime
with
their
faces
still
to
summer
men
do
not
know
what
age
says
to
a
woman
they
would
not
wait
to
feel
slip
from
their
hands
without
a
throe
without
a
struggle
futile
and
desperate
all
that
has
given
them
wealth
and
love
and
power
doomed
without
hope
or
rumour
of
reprieve
they
would
not
smile
into
the
eyes
of
that
advancing
hour
who
had
bent
all
summer
to
their
bow
and
had
flung
the
widest
rose
and
kissed
the
keenest
mouth
and
slept
in
the
lordliest
bed
when
they
were
young
that
bitter
twilight
which
youth
flies
headlong
keeps
age
loitering
on
the
hill
uneager
to
fold
such
greyness
to
his
breast
knowing
that
none
will
thwart
him
of
his
will
none
be
before
him
on
that
quest
i
am
growing
old
i
was
not
always
kind
when
i
was
young
to
women
who
were
old
for
youth
is
blind
a
small
green
bitter
thing
beneath
its
fragrant
rind
and
fanged
against
the
old
with
boisterous
tongue
those
whose
poor
morning
heads
are
touched
with
rime
walking
before
their
misery
like
kings
i
did
not
think
that
i
should
feel
such
stings
nor
flinch
beneath
such
arrows
but
now
i
know
one
day
i
shall
be
stupid
and
rather
slow
and
easily
cowed
and
troubled
in
my
mind
and
tremulous
vaguely
frightened
feeble
and
cold
i
am
growing
old
my
god
how
old
how
old
i
dare
not
tell
them
but
one
day
they
will
know
i
hope
they
will
be
kind
annunciation
the
lord
appeared
in
a
flame
of
fire
out
of
the
midst
of
a
bush
and
behold
the
bush
burned
with
fire
and
the
bush
was
not
consumed
exodus
iii
when
to
your
virgin
heart
unstirred
ungiven
upon
the
quiet
mountain
side
untrod
the
sudden
naked
fire
came
down
from
heaven
burning
you
with
the
very
breath
of
god
was
the
sun
lost
were
all
the
sweet
stars
dim
while
god
raised
round
your
head
those
walls
of
light
were
you
locked
dumbly
terribly
with
him
within
that
burning
temple
day
and
night
what
was
it
to
have
god
there
like
a
bird
god
like
a
great
gold
flower
upon
your
breast
while
he
spake
things
that
only
one
man
heard
face
down
before
that
glory
manifest
when
that
strange
flame
went
up
the
mountain
side
were
your
forsaken
lips
so
burned
with
gold
that
the
creatures
of
the
wild
stood
off
and
cried
and
in
your
breast
no
blossom
dared
unfold
did
you
call
back
the
startled
birds
to
build
and
put
forth
all
your
simple
buds
again
forgetting
how
your
branches
once
were
filled
in
sweet
embrace
of
passing
sun
and
rain
or
were
all
other
birds
forbidden
sing
after
those
great
gold
plumes
had
made
their
nest
was
in
its
strange
and
awful
blossoming
that
great
gold
flower
the
last
upon
your
breast
boys
bathing
round
them
a
fierce
wide
crazy
noon
heaves
with
crushed
lips
and
glowing
sides
against
the
huge
and
drowsy
sun
beneath
them
turn
the
glittering
tides
where
dizzy
waters
reel
with
gold
and
strange
rich
trophies
sink
and
rise
from
decks
of
sunken
argosies
with
shining
arms
they
cleave
the
cold
far
reaches
of
the
sea
and
beat
the
hissing
foam
with
flash
of
feet
into
bright
fangs
while
breathlessly
curls
over
them
the
amorous
sea
naked
they
laugh
and
revel
there
one
shakes
the
from
his
hair
then
singing
takes
the
bubbles
one
lies
couched
among
the
shells
the
sands
telling
gold
hours
between
his
hands
one
floats
like
in
the
sun
the
gods
of
youth
the
lords
of
love
greeks
of
eternal
thessaly
mocking
the
powers
they
know
not
of
naked
and
unembraced
and
free
to
whom
the
siren
sings
in
vain
who
shall
be
the
destined
sport
of
gods
and
men
unseen
the
immortal
ones
are
here
remembering
their
mortal
loves
the
strange
sweet
flesh
the
lips
that
were
frail
and
most
perishably
fair
diana
leaves
her
whispering
groves
and
of
actæon
dreams
and
sighs
and
hears
the
hounds
bay
in
the
wood
oh
cythera
the
trembling
blood
upon
one
petal
paling
mouth
before
thee
and
this
noon
must
rise
while
thou
remember
adon
eyes
one
mournful
and
complaining
shade
beyond
avernus
bows
his
head
dreaming
of
one
beloved
youth
borne
from
him
lost
and
dazed
and
dead
dragged
by
the
nymphs
avenging
hair
into
the
oozing
dim
in
that
cold
twilight
unaware
of
each
great
sunrise
over
him
one
day
while
still
these
waters
run
and
noon
still
heaves
beneath
this
sun
you
shall
creep
unremembering
whom
life
has
humbled
and
subdued
ruined
your
bodies
tamed
your
blood
no
more
the
lords
of
anything
but
spent
and
racked
with
mortal
pains
the
slow
tide
pushing
through
your
veins
coldly
you
face
this
magic
shore
for
you
the
disenchanted
noon
scarce
haunted
is
with
ghosts
that
were
once
and
were
you
and
are
no
more
faltering
against
the
wind
and
sun
that
vainly
seek
your
hair
for
gold
stubborned
with
habit
grey
and
old
you
know
not
why
you
wander
here
nor
what
vague
dream
pursues
you
still
for
life
has
taken
fullest
toll
of
all
your
beauty
on
each
soul
love
hand
has
left
his
bitter
mark
has
had
of
you
his
utmost
will
and
thrusts
you
headlong
to
the
dark
and
colder
than
these
waters
are
the
stream
that
takes
your
limbs
at
last
earth
vales
and
hills
drift
slowly
past
one
shore
far
off
and
one
more
far
lady
hamilton
men
wondered
why
i
loved
you
and
none
guessed
how
sweet
your
slow
divine
stupidity
your
look
of
earth
your
sense
of
drowsy
rest
so
rich
so
strange
so
all
unlike
my
sea
after
the
temper
of
my
sails
my
lean
tall
masts
you
were
the
lure
of
harbour
hours
a
sleepy
landscape
warm
and
very
green
where
browsing
creatures
stare
above
still
flowers
these
salt
hands
holding
sweetness
the
leader
led
a
slave
too
happy
and
too
crazed
to
rule
sea
brine
and
honey
in
one
bed
and
england
man
your
servant
and
your
fool
my
banqueting
eyes
foreswore
my
waiting
ships
i
was
a
silly
landsman
at
your
lips
white
magic
is
it
not
a
wonderful
thing
to
be
able
to
force
an
astonished
plant
to
bear
rare
flowers
which
are
foreign
to
it
and
to
obtain
a
marvellous
result
from
sap
which
left
to
itself
would
have
produced
corollas
without
beauty
virgil
i
stood
forlorn
and
pale
pressed
by
the
cold
sand
pinched
by
the
thin
grass
last
of
my
race
and
frail
who
reigned
in
beauty
once
when
beauty
was
before
the
rich
earth
beckoned
to
the
sea
took
his
salt
lips
to
taste
and
spread
this
gradual
waste
this
ruin
of
flower
this
doom
of
grass
and
tree
each
spring
could
scarcely
lift
my
brows
from
the
sand
drift
to
fill
my
lips
with
april
as
she
went
or
force
my
weariness
to
its
sad
summer
dress
on
the
harsh
beach
i
heard
the
grey
sea
rise
the
ragged
grass
made
ceaseless
dim
lament
and
day
and
night
scarce
changed
the
mournful
skies
foot
on
the
sand
a
shadow
on
the
sea
a
face
leaned
over
me
across
each
wasted
limb
passed
healingly
a
warm
great
hand
i
was
drawn
up
to
him
from
my
frail
feet
fell
the
last
grains
of
sand
then
haste
and
darkness
stooped
and
made
me
theirs
deep
handed
me
to
deep
i
faded
then
as
names
fade
from
men
prayers
as
a
sigh
from
lips
at
last
made
friends
with
sleep
but
the
same
hand
that
bore
me
from
the
sea
waking
me
tenderly
bound
me
to
a
rough
stranger
of
my
race
me
weary
and
pale
to
him
and
him
to
me
i
turned
my
piteous
face
aside
ashamed
i
struggled
to
be
free
i
slept
i
dreamed
i
woke
to
that
embrace
sweet
tides
stole
through
my
veins
strange
fires
and
thrills
and
pains
to
my
cold
lips
the
bloom
crept
back
once
more
i
glowed
as
a
bride
glows
i
watched
the
days
with
delicate
hands
restore
my
kinship
with
the
rose
about
my
throat
my
hair
went
like
a
flame
my
brows
were
wreathed
in
purple
i
was
dressed
i
bore
a
new
bride
name
a
great
star
burned
my
breast
no
longer
bound
i
leaned
the
same
sweet
way
as
even
a
great
queen
may
towards
her
lover
now
astonished
i
who
was
a
beggar
stand
obediently
beside
cophetua
in
the
orchard
i
thought
you
loved
me
no
it
was
only
fun
when
we
stood
there
closer
than
all
well
the
harvest
moon
was
shining
and
queer
in
your
hair
and
it
turned
my
head
that
made
you
yes
just
the
moon
and
the
light
it
made
under
the
tree
well
your
mouth
too
yes
my
mouth
and
the
quiet
there
that
sang
like
the
drum
in
the
booth
you
should
have
danced
like
that
like
what
so
close
with
your
head
turned
up
and
the
flower
in
your
hair
a
rose
that
smelt
all
warm
i
loved
you
i
thought
you
knew
i
would
have
danced
like
that
with
any
but
you
i
did
know
i
thought
you
knew
it
was
fun
i
thought
it
was
love
you
meant
well
it
done
yes
it
done
i
seen
boys
stone
a
blackbird
and
watched
them
drown
a
kitten
it
clawed
at
the
reeds
and
they
pushed
it
down
into
the
pool
while
it
screamed
is
that
fun
too
well
boys
are
like
that
your
brothers
yes
i
know
but
you
so
lovely
and
strong
not
you
not
you
they
do
understand
it
cruel
it
only
a
game
and
are
girls
fun
too
no
still
in
a
way
it
the
same
it
queer
and
lovely
to
have
a
girl
go
on
it
makes
you
mad
for
a
bit
to
feel
she
your
own
and
you
laugh
and
kiss
her
and
maybe
you
give
her
a
ring
but
it
only
in
fun
but
i
gave
you
everything
well
you
should
have
done
it
you
know
what
a
fellow
thinks
when
a
girl
does
that
yes
he
talks
of
her
over
his
drinks
and
calls
her
a
stop
that
now
i
thought
you
knew
but
it
was
with
anyone
else
it
was
only
you
how
did
i
know
i
thought
you
wanted
it
too
i
thought
you
were
like
the
rest
well
what
to
be
done
to
be
done
is
it
all
right
yes
sure
yes
but
why
i
do
know
i
thought
you
were
going
to
cry
you
said
you
had
something
to
tell
me
yes
i
know
it
was
anything
really
i
think
i
go
yes
it
late
there
thunder
about
a
drop
of
rain
fell
on
my
hand
in
the
dark
i
see
you
again
at
the
dance
next
week
you
sure
that
everything
right
yes
well
i
be
going
kiss
me
good
night
good
night
the
wood
and
the
shore
the
low
bay
melts
into
a
ring
of
silver
and
slips
it
on
the
shore
reluctant
finger
though
in
an
hour
the
tide
will
turn
will
tremble
forsaking
her
because
the
moon
persuades
him
but
the
black
wood
that
leans
and
sighs
above
her
no
hour
can
change
no
moon
can
slave
nor
summon
then
comes
the
dark
on
sleepy
beaches
long
pale
leagues
of
sand
and
cold
clear
water
she
hears
the
tide
go
out
towards
the
moonlight
the
wood
still
leans
weeping
she
turns
to
seek
him
and
his
black
hair
all
night
is
on
her
bosom
the
tryst
i
raised
the
veil
i
loosed
the
bands
i
took
the
dead
thing
from
its
place
like
a
warm
stream
in
frozen
lands
my
lips
went
wandering
on
her
face
my
hands
burnt
in
her
hands
she
could
not
stay
me
being
dead
her
body
here
was
mine
to
hold
what
if
her
lips
had
lost
their
red
to
me
they
always
tasted
cold
with
the
cold
words
she
said
did
my
breath
run
along
her
hair
and
free
the
pulse
and
fire
the
brain
my
wild
blood
wake
her
wild
blood
there
her
eyelids
lifted
wide
again
in
a
blue
sudden
stare
beneath
my
fierce
profane
caress
the
whole
white
length
of
body
moved
the
drowsy
bosom
seemed
to
press
as
if
against
a
breast
beloved
then
fail
for
weariness
no
not
that
anguish
christ
forbid
that
i
should
raise
such
dead
i
rose
stifled
the
mouth
with
lilies
hid
those
eyes
and
drew
the
long
hair
close
and
shut
the
coffin
lid
my
cold
brow
on
the
cold
wood
laid
quiet
and
close
we
lie
no
cruel
words
her
lips
have
said
i
shall
not
take
nor
she
deny
the
dead
is
with
the
dead
leda
you
remember
leda
there
are
those
who
love
to
whom
love
brings
great
gladness
such
thing
have
not
i
love
looks
and
has
no
mercy
brings
long
doom
to
others
such
was
i
heart
breaking
hand
upon
the
lute
touching
one
note
only
such
were
you
who
shall
play
now
upon
that
lute
long
last
made
musical
by
you
sharp
in
the
swelling
fruit
blind
frost
upon
the
eyes
of
flowers
who
shall
now
praise
the
shrivelled
fruit
or
raise
the
eyelids
of
those
flowers
i
dare
not
watch
that
hidden
pool
nor
see
the
wild
bird
sudden
wing
lifting
the
wide
brown
shaken
pool
but
round
me
falls
that
secret
wing
and
in
that
sharp
perverse
sweet
pain
that
is
and
my
withered
hands
are
curled
on
pain
that
were
so
wide
once
after
bliss
and
gold
is
springing
in
my
hair
as
my
thoughts
spring
and
flower
with
it
though
i
sit
hid
in
my
grey
hair
without
love
or
the
pain
of
it
yet
oh
my
swan
if
love
have
wings
as
the
gods
tell
us
you
were
love
who
took
and
broke
me
with
those
wings
i
weak
and
being
far
gone
in
love
let
blushless
things
be
breathed
and
done
things
flowered
out
now
in
bitter
fruit
that
once
done
are
no
more
undone
than
last
year
frost
and
last
year
fruit
for
what
has
come
of
love
and
me
who
knew
the
first
joy
that
loving
is
where
has
love
led
and
beckoned
me
but
to
the
end
where
nothing
is
i
have
seen
my
blood
beat
out
again
red
in
the
hands
of
all
my
line
my
sin
has
swelled
and
flowered
again
corrupt
and
fierce
through
sparta
line
bred
through
me
bred
through
delicate
hands
and
wandering
eyes
and
wanton
lips
sighing
after
strange
flesh
as
sighed
these
lips
straying
after
new
sin
as
strayed
these
hands
mother
of
helen
she
whose
breasts
to
new
desires
unshaped
the
world
above
troy
summit
towered
these
breasts
helen
who
wantoned
with
the
world
helen
is
dead
she
had
love
enough
to
laugh
at
doom
and
mock
at
shrine
and
clytemnestra
quiet
enough
beneath
apollo
shrine
and
i
am
left
the
source
the
spring
of
all
their
madness
they
are
dead
while
i
still
sit
here
the
old
spring
that
fouled
them
flows
above
the
dead
but
i
have
paid
i
have
borne
enough
i
am
very
old
in
love
and
woe
for
all
souls
these
things
are
enough
who
have
known
love
are
the
friends
of
woe
there
those
who
love
and
who
escape
there
are
those
who
love
and
do
not
die
i
loved
and
there
was
no
escape
long
since
i
died
and
daily
die
and
death
alone
makes
hate
and
love
friends
with
each
other
and
with
sleep
all
quiet
here
that
once
was
love
this
that
is
left
belongs
to
sleep
the
harebell
you
give
no
portent
of
impermanence
though
before
sun
goes
you
are
long
gone
hence
your
bright
inherited
crown
withered
and
fallen
down
it
seems
that
your
blue
immobility
has
been
for
ever
and
must
for
ever
be
man
seems
the
unstable
thing
fevered
and
hurrying
so
free
of
joy
so
prodigal
of
tears
yet
he
can
hold
his
fevers
seventy
years
sun
rain
and
frost
by
which
you
are
soon
lost
words
is
it
not
brave
to
be
a
king
techelles
usumcasane
and
theridamas
is
it
not
passing
brave
to
be
a
king
and
ride
in
triumph
through
persepolis
marlowe
bring
the
great
words
that
scourge
the
thundering
line
with
lust
and
slaughter
words
that
reek
of
doom
and
the
lost
battle
and
the
ruined
shrine
words
dire
and
black
as
midnight
on
a
tomb
hushed
speech
of
waters
on
the
lip
of
gloom
huge
sounds
of
death
and
plunder
in
the
night
words
whose
vast
plumes
above
the
ages
meet
girdling
the
lost
dark
centuries
in
their
flight
the
slave
of
their
unfetterable
feet
bring
words
as
pure
as
rills
of
earliest
spring
in
some
far
cranny
of
the
hillside
born
to
stitch
again
the
earth
green
habiting
words
lonely
as
the
long
blue
fields
of
morn
words
on
the
wistful
lyre
of
winds
forlorn
to
the
sad
ear
of
grief
from
distance
blown
thin
bleat
of
fawn
and
airy
babble
of
birds
sounds
of
bright
water
slipping
on
the
stone
where
the
thrilled
fountain
pipes
to
woodland
words
bring
passionate
words
from
noontide
slumber
roused
to
slake
the
amorous
lips
of
love
with
fruit
dripping
with
honey
and
with
syrups
drowsed
to
draw
from
the
dreaming
lute
words
gold
and
mad
and
headlong
in
pursuit
of
laughter
words
that
are
too
sweet
to
say
and
fade
unsaid
upon
some
rose
mouth
words
soft
as
winds
that
ever
blow
one
way
the
summer
way
the
long
way
from
the
south
for
such
words
have
high
lineage
and
were
known
of
milton
once
whose
heart
on
theirs
still
beats
marlowe
hurled
forth
huge
stars
to
make
them
crown
they
are
stained
still
with
the
dying
lips
of
keats
as
queens
they
trod
the
cloak
in
shakespeare
streets
pale
hands
of
shelley
gently
guard
their
flame
chatterton
heart
was
burst
upon
their
spears
their
dynasty
unbroken
and
their
name
music
in
all
men
mouths
for
all
men
ears
but
now
they
are
lost
their
lordliest
stained
upon
their
ruined
walls
no
trumpet
rings
their
shrines
defiled
their
sacraments
profaned
men
crown
the
crow
they
have
given
the
jackal
wings
slaves
wear
the
peplum
beggars
ride
as
kings
they
couple
foolish
words
and
look
for
birth
of
mighty
emperor
christ
or
avatar
they
mate
with
slaves
from
whom
no
king
comes
forth
no
child
is
theirs
who
follow
not
the
star
apollo
thou
art
worshipped
still
we
quest
for
beauty
on
thy
hills
like
hounds
let
these
poor
rhymers
babble
as
they
will
filling
their
pipes
with
shrill
and
crazy
sounds
poets
still
praise
thee
music
still
abounds
and
beauty
knows
the
hour
of
thy
return
for
the
gods
live
albeit
temples
burn
suffer
the
fools
their
folly
let
them
be
wreathing
each
other
with
their
wreaths
of
straw
trailing
their
pageants
of
the
mud
but
we
await
thy
laurel
on
our
brows
with
awe
and
if
thou
wreathe
not
let
us
still
be
found
thy
slaves
thou
dost
not
bind
unworthy
things
them
hast
thou
chained
not
better
heads
uncrowned
than
mock
regalia
of
the
rabble
kings
shrift
i
am
not
true
but
you
would
pardon
this
if
you
could
see
the
tortured
spirit
take
its
place
beside
you
in
the
dark
and
break
your
daily
food
of
love
and
kindliness
you
guess
the
bitter
thing
that
treachery
is
furtive
and
on
its
guard
asleep
awake
fearing
to
sin
yet
fearing
to
forsake
and
daily
giving
christ
the
judas
kiss
but
piteous
amends
i
make
each
day
to
recompense
the
evil
with
the
good
with
double
pang
i
play
the
double
part
of
all
you
trust
and
all
that
i
betray
what
long
atonement
makes
my
penitent
blood
to
what
sad
tryst
goes
my
unfaithful
heart
the
thief
of
beauty
the
mind
is
beauty
thief
the
poet
takes
the
golden
spendthrift
trail
among
the
blooms
where
she
stands
tossing
silver
in
the
lakes
and
twisting
bright
swift
threads
on
airy
looms
her
ring
the
poppy
snatches
and
the
rose
with
laughter
plunders
all
her
gusty
plumes
he
steals
behind
her
gathering
as
she
goes
heedless
of
summer
end
certain
and
soon
of
winter
rattling
at
the
door
of
june
when
beauty
lies
pale
and
still
forsaken
of
her
lovers
and
her
lords
and
winter
keeps
cold
watch
upon
the
hill
then
he
lets
fall
his
bale
of
coloured
words
at
frosty
midnight
june
shall
rise
in
flame
move
at
his
magic
with
her
bells
and
birds
the
rose
will
redden
as
he
speaks
her
name
he
shall
release
earth
frozen
bosom
there
and
with
great
words
shall
cuff
the
whining
air
forgotten
dead
i
salute
you
dawn
has
flashed
up
the
startled
skies
night
has
gone
out
beneath
the
hill
many
sweet
times
before
our
eyes
dawn
makes
and
unmakes
about
us
still
the
magic
that
we
call
the
rose
the
gentle
history
of
the
rain
has
been
unfolded
traced
and
lost
by
the
sharp
of
frost
birds
in
the
hawthorn
build
again
the
hare
makes
soft
her
secret
house
the
wind
at
tourney
comes
and
goes
spurring
the
green
unharnessed
boughs
the
moon
has
waxed
fierce
and
waned
dim
he
knew
the
beauty
of
all
those
last
year
and
who
remembers
him
love
sometimes
walks
the
waters
still
laughter
throws
back
her
radiant
head
utterly
beauty
is
not
gone
and
wonder
is
not
wholly
dead
the
starry
mortal
world
rolls
on
between
sweet
sounds
and
silences
with
new
strange
wines
her
beakers
brim
he
lost
his
heritage
with
these
last
year
and
who
remembers
him
none
remember
him
he
lies
in
earth
of
some
place
nameless
beneath
the
nameless
skies
the
wind
his
only
chant
the
rain
the
only
tears
upon
his
face
far
and
forgotten
utterly
by
living
man
yet
such
as
he
have
made
it
possible
and
sure
for
other
lives
to
have
to
be
for
men
to
sleep
content
secure
lip
touches
lip
and
eyes
meet
eyes
because
his
heart
beats
not
again
his
rotting
fruitless
body
lies
that
sons
may
grow
from
other
men
he
gave
as
christ
the
life
he
had
the
only
life
desired
or
known
the
great
sad
sacrifice
was
made
for
strangers
this
forgotten
dead
went
out
into
the
night
alone
there
was
his
body
broken
for
you
there
was
his
blood
divinely
shed
that
in
the
earth
lie
lost
and
dim
eat
drink
and
often
as
you
do
for
whom
he
died
remember
him
madala
goes
by
the
orphanage
unaware
of
its
terror
and
but
half
aware
of
the
world
beauty
near
her
of
sunlight
on
the
stones
and
trembling
birds
in
the
square
lightly
went
madala
a
rose
blown
suddenly
from
spring
gay
mouth
part
of
the
spring
was
she
warmed
to
her
delicate
bones
cool
in
its
linen
her
skin
her
hair
and
curled
lightly
she
flowered
on
the
sin
and
pain
of
the
world
down
the
street
went
crazy
men
the
winter
misery
of
their
blood
budding
in
new
pain
while
beggars
whined
beside
her
while
the
streets
daughters
eyed
her
poor
flowers
that
kept
midsummer
with
desperate
bloom
and
thrust
stale
rose
at
each
newcomer
and
crime
and
hunger
and
lust
raged
in
the
noisy
dust
lightly
went
madala
unshaken
still
of
that
spell
coral
beads
and
jade
to
buy
while
her
thoughts
roamed
easily
thoughts
like
bees
in
lavender
thoughts
gay
and
fragile
as
a
robin
shell
till
suddenly
she
had
come
to
grim
wall
behind
whose
mask
of
bars
starts
up
in
shame
the
foundlings
hospital
at
the
gates
to
watch
her
pass
a
caged
thing
eyed
her
dumb
most
mercifully
unaware
of
its
own
hurt
but
madala
stopped
short
of
spring
that
day
the
air
grew
pinched
and
wan
a
hand
came
over
the
sun
birds
huddled
stones
went
grey
her
lace
and
linen
white
seemed
but
her
body
sin
her
flesh
unscarred
and
bright
burnt
like
a
leper
skin
her
mouth
was
stale
with
bread
flung
her
by
strangers
she
was
fed
housed
fathered
by
the
state
and
she
had
grown
a
thing
belonging
to
and
loved
by
none
though
the
shut
mouth
said
no
word
from
the
caged
thing
she
heard
who
has
wronged
me
that
this
spring
gives
me
nothing
and
you
everything
who
alike
were
made
who
beckon
the
same
dreams
you
buy
coral
and
jade
i
sew
long
hungry
seams
to
pay
for
charity
then
madala
heart
afraid
cried
the
first
selfish
cry
is
it
my
fault
can
i
help
what
the
world
has
done
can
the
flower
in
the
shade
blame
the
flower
in
the
sun
then
quick
the
caged
thing
said
as
if
to
ask
pardon
that
its
words
had
made
madala
spring
so
spoiled
for
her
that
day
but
there
a
way
a
way
if
flowers
would
share
their
spring
there
be
sunshine
enough
for
all
the
flowers
such
sunshine
you
could
bring
such
joy
that
swings
and
flies
with
posies
your
hours
through
so
just
beyond
my
hours
if
i
could
walk
with
you
not
in
pitiful
two
by
two
flayed
by
free
children
eyes
your
sister
for
an
hour
to
be
it
would
double
joy
and
woo
spring
back
to
you
and
more
than
spring
to
me
then
something
quaked
in
madala
quaked
with
magic
quaked
with
awe
she
became
a
part
of
this
caged
thing
she
was
aware
of
strange
lips
tugging
at
her
heart
so
clear
the
way
was
tenderer
grew
her
eyes
and
as
they
grew
back
to
the
flowers
rushed
the
dew
the
earth
filled
out
with
the
sun
the
cold
birds
in
the
square
unbundled
and
preened
upon
their
twigs
in
the
softening
air
the
cold
wind
dwindled
and
dropped
and
love
and
the
world
were
one
nearer
drew
madala
at
the
dumb
thing
she
smiled
and
spring
that
a
child
had
stopped
came
back
from
the
eyes
of
a
child
guilford
street
london
the
gates
of
which
face
the
street
obsession
i
will
not
have
roses
in
my
room
again
nor
listen
to
sonnets
of
michael
angelo
nor
any
night
nor
fret
my
brain
with
all
the
trouble
of
things
that
i
should
know
i
will
be
as
other
women
come
and
go
careless
and
free
my
own
self
sure
and
sane
as
i
was
once
then
suddenly
you
were
there
with
your
old
power
roses
were
everywhere
and
i
was
listening
to
michael
angelo
enough
he
forget
i
do
not
remember
all
i
had
of
him
once
i
still
have
he
was
lovely
to
me
as
the
word
amber
as
the
taste
of
honey
and
as
the
smell
of
hay
what
if
he
forget
if
i
remember
what
more
of
love
have
you
than
i
to
say
i
have
and
hold
him
still
in
the
word
amber
taste
of
honey
brings
him
he
comes
back
with
the
hay
in
memory
of
douglas
vernon
cow
this
poem
dedicated
to
his
mother
to
twilight
heads
comes
death
as
comes
a
friend
as
with
the
gentle
fading
of
the
year
fades
rose
folds
leaf
falls
fruit
and
to
their
end
unquestioning
draw
near
their
flowering
over
and
their
fruiting
done
fulfilled
and
finished
and
going
down
with
the
sun
but
for
june
heart
there
is
no
comforting
when
her
rose
still
quick
with
buds
still
thrilling
to
the
air
by
some
stray
wind
is
tossed
her
swelling
grain
that
goes
heavy
to
harvesting
in
a
black
gale
is
lost
and
her
round
grape
that
purpled
to
the
wine
is
pinched
by
some
chance
frost
ah
then
cry
out
for
that
lost
lovely
rose
for
the
stricken
wheat
and
for
the
finished
vine
such
were
you
who
sleep
now
who
have
foregone
so
many
of
life
rich
secrets
almost
learned
winning
so
much
so
much
as
yet
unwon
yet
to
be
dared
to
discover
to
reveal
quick
still
with
ardour
hand
still
at
the
wheel
on
wide
and
unsailed
seas
eyes
turning
still
towards
the
morning
while
the
keen
brain
burned
to
the
imperative
will
upon
your
summer
death
seems
to
set
his
heel
writes
on
the
page
no
more
and
brings
the
sign
of
sunset
shuts
the
door
and
the
house
is
dark
and
the
tired
mourners
sleep
yet
says
he
too
though
quiet
at
last
you
lie
and
have
done
with
laughter
and
strife
and
joy
and
care
you
have
honour
with
your
peace
and
still
you
keep
fullness
of
life
and
of
felicity
you
have
seen
the
grail
what
need
you
of
grey
hair
there
are
those
who
daily
die
who
have
long
out
lived
their
welcome
in
the
world
who
are
old
and
sad
and
tired
and
fain
to
cease
from
the
crowded
earth
and
the
hours
in
tumult
whirled
urgent
and
vain
you
are
not
such
as
these
who
have
striven
for
laurels
and
never
knew
the
shade
upon
their
brows
who
would
persuade
the
rose
and
never
have
come
near
it
till
the
head
bows
and
the
heart
breaks
and
the
spirit
knows
only
its
failure
dim
and
featureless
its
weariness
of
all
things
dreamed
and
done
when
love
and
grief
alike
seem
emptiness
and
fame
and
man
unrecognition
one
the
full
tide
took
you
you
went
out
with
the
sun
not
in
the
cringing
ebb
not
in
the
grey
and
tremulous
twilight
when
each
lonely
one
to
its
last
loneliness
must
creep
away
your
genius
has
won
its
rich
repose
full
laurelled
wearing
still
the
unfaded
rose
and
as
those
who
bid
at
snowdrop
time
bear
with
them
broken
promises
of
spring
so
you
in
triumph
in
the
glory
men
had
in
you
in
love
full
worshipping
high
summer
thoughts
untouched
of
winter
rime
went
forth
with
honour
having
fulfilled
your
spring
the
hands
that
built
you
felt
you
flower
from
her
prayer
true
to
her
vision
true
fearless
and
fine
shaped
from
her
fashioning
hands
empty
now
and
yet
not
all
unfilled
having
built
and
fired
the
generous
heart
and
brain
of
the
man
you
were
whose
fervent
spirit
willed
you
to
the
service
and
healing
and
help
of
men
these
things
are
hers
not
to
be
lost
nor
changed
with
changes
of
death
for
though
the
body
die
the
golden
deed
is
stamped
eternally
with
the
head
of
god
the
new
and
alien
years
leave
it
still
bright
unaltered
unestranged
almost
too
proud
and
too
profound
for
tears
is
the
high
memory
that
the
desolate
heart
shrines
and
is
dumb
yet
may
for
ever
keep
unforbidden
the
imperishable
part
and
what
love
held
awake
he
holds
asleep
the
cloudberry
give
me
no
coil
of
dæmon
flowers
pale
messalines
that
faint
and
brood
through
the
spent
secret
twilight
hours
on
their
strange
feasts
of
blood
give
me
wild
things
of
moss
and
peat
the
gipsy
flower
that
bravely
goes
the
heather
little
hard
brown
feet
and
the
black
eyes
of
sloes
but
most
of
all
the
cloudberry
that
offers
in
her
clean
white
cup
the
melting
snows
the
cloudberry
where
the
great
winds
go
up
to
the
hushed
peak
whose
shadow
fills
the
air
with
silence
calm
and
wide
she
lives
the
dian
of
the
hills
and
the
streams
course
beside
to
between
two
common
days
this
day
was
hung
when
love
went
to
the
ending
that
was
his
his
seamless
robe
was
rent
his
brow
was
wrung
he
took
at
last
the
sponge
bitter
kiss
a
simple
day
the
dawn
had
watched
unfold
before
the
night
had
borne
the
death
of
love
you
took
the
bread
i
blessed
and
love
was
sold
upon
your
lips
and
paid
the
price
thereof
i
changed
then
as
when
soul
from
body
slips
and
casts
its
passion
and
its
pain
aside
i
pledged
you
with
most
spiritual
lips
and
gave
you
hands
that
you
had
crucified
you
who
betrayed
kissed
crucified
forgot
you
walked
with
christ
poor
fool
and
knew
it
not
for
fasting
days
are
you
my
songs
importunate
of
praise
be
still
remember
for
your
comforting
that
sweeter
birds
have
had
less
leave
to
sing
before
men
piped
them
from
their
lonely
ways
greener
leaves
than
yours
are
lost
in
every
spring
rubies
far
redder
thrust
their
eager
rays
into
the
blindfold
dark
for
many
days
before
men
chose
them
for
a
sing
as
you
dare
not
as
men
choose
receive
not
the
passing
fashion
prize
for
dole
or
due
men
unrecognition
grieve
not
oh
stoop
not
to
them
better
far
that
you
should
go
unsung
than
sing
as
you
believe
not
should
go
uncrowned
than
to
yourselves
untrue
the
father
the
evening
found
us
whom
the
day
had
fled
once
more
in
bitter
anger
you
and
i
over
some
small
some
foolish
trivial
thing
our
anger
would
not
decently
let
die
but
dragged
between
us
shamed
and
shivering
until
each
other
taunts
we
scarcely
heard
until
we
lost
the
sense
of
all
we
said
and
knew
not
who
first
spoke
the
fatal
word
it
seemed
that
even
every
kiss
we
wrung
we
killed
at
birth
with
shuddering
and
hate
as
if
we
feared
a
thing
too
passionate
however
close
we
clung
one
hour
the
next
hour
found
us
separate
estranged
and
love
most
bitter
on
our
tongue
we
quarrelled
over
one
small
head
our
fruit
of
last
year
maying
the
white
bud
blown
from
our
stormy
kisses
and
the
dead
first
rapture
of
our
wild
estranging
blood
you
clutched
him
there
was
panther
in
your
eyes
we
breathed
like
beasts
in
thickets
on
the
wall
our
shadows
swelled
as
in
huge
tyrannies
the
room
grew
dark
with
anger
yet
through
all
the
shame
and
hurt
and
pity
of
it
you
were
still
strangely
and
imperishably
dear
as
one
who
loves
the
wild
day
none
the
less
that
turns
to
naught
the
lilac
miracle
breaking
the
unrecapturable
spell
of
the
first
magic
and
mystery
utterly
scattering
of
earth
and
sky
making
even
the
rose
loveliness
a
thing
for
pain
to
be
remembered
by
i
said
my
son
shall
wear
his
father
sword
you
said
shall
hands
once
blossoms
at
my
breast
be
stained
with
blood
i
answered
with
a
word
more
bitter
and
your
own
the
bitterest
stung
me
to
sullen
anger
and
i
said
my
son
shall
be
no
coward
of
his
line
because
his
mother
choose
you
turned
your
head
and
your
eyes
grew
implacable
on
mine
and
like
a
trodden
snake
you
turned
to
meet
the
foe
with
sudden
hissing
then
you
smiled
and
broke
our
life
in
pieces
at
my
feet
your
child
you
said

the
following
poem
is
not
a
study
of
the
economic
struggle
of
women
but
of
the
antagonism
of
spirit
which
constitutes
the
eternal
andromeda

to
the
years

the
measureless
wrong

visited
of
the

so
seldom
as
things
tamed
forget
the
