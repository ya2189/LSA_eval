catherine
borne
by
angels
a
slow
through
the
solemn
air
in
silence
sailing
borne
by
mysterious
angels
strong
and
fair
she
sleeps
at
last
blest
dreams
her
eyelids
veiling
above
this
weary
world
of
strife
and
care
lo
how
she
passeth
dreamy
slow
and
calm
scarce
wave
those
broad
white
wings
so
silvery
bright
those
cloudy
robes
in
folding
sweep
mistily
athwart
the
evening
light
far
far
below
the
dim
forsaken
earth
the
foes
that
threaten
or
the
friends
that
weep
past
like
a
dream
the
torture
and
the
pain
for
so
he
giveth
his
beloved
sleep
the
restless
bosom
of
the
surging
ocean
gives
back
the
image
as
the
cloud
floats
hushing
in
glassy
awe
his
troubled
motion
for
one
blest
moment
he
complains
no
more
like
the
transparent
golden
floor
of
heaven
his
charmed
waters
lie
as
in
a
dream
and
glistening
wings
and
starry
robes
unfolding
and
serious
angel
eyes
far
downward
gleam
o
restless
sea
thou
seemest
all
enchanted
by
that
sweet
vision
of
celestial
rest
where
are
the
winds
and
tides
thy
peace
that
haunted
so
still
thou
seemest
so
glorified
and
blest
ah
sea
that
sweet
scene
forgotten
dark
tides
and
tempests
shall
thy
bosom
rear
and
thy
complaining
waves
with
restless
motion
shall
toss
their
hands
in
their
old
wild
despair
so
our
hearts
sometimes
the
sweet
sad
story
of
suffering
saints
borne
homeward
crowned
and
blest
shines
down
in
stillness
with
a
tender
glory
and
makes
a
mirror
there
of
breathless
rest
for
not
alone
in
those
old
eastern
regions
are
christ
beloved
ones
tried
by
cross
and
chain
in
many
a
house
are
his
elect
ones
hidden
his
martyrs
suffering
in
their
patient
pain
the
rack
the
cross
life
weary
wrench
of
woe
the
world
sees
not
as
slow
from
day
to
day
in
calm
unspoken
patience
sadly
still
the
loving
spirit
bleeds
itself
away
but
there
are
hours
when
from
the
heavens
unfolding
come
down
the
angels
with
the
glad
release
and
we
look
upward
to
behold
in
glory
our
suffering
loved
ones
borne
away
to
peace
ah
brief
the
calm
the
restless
wave
of
feeling
rises
again
when
the
bright
cloud
sweeps
by
and
our
unrestful
souls
reflect
no
longer
that
tender
vision
of
the
upper
sky
espoused
lord
of
the
pure
saints
in
glory
to
whom
all
faithful
souls
affianced
are
breathe
down
thy
peace
into
our
restless
spirits
and
make
a
lasting
heavenly
vision
there
so
the
bright
gates
no
more
on
us
shall
close
no
more
the
cloud
of
angels
fade
away
and
we
shall
walk
amid
life
weary
strife
in
the
calm
light
of
thine
eternal
day
footnote
a
according
to
this
legend
catherine
was
a
noble
maiden
of
alexandria
distinguished
alike
by
birth
riches
beauty
and
the
rarest
gifts
of
genius
and
learning
in
the
flower
of
her
life
she
consecrated
herself
to
the
service
of
her
redeemer
and
cheerfully
suffered
for
his
sake
the
loss
of
wealth
friends
and
the
esteem
of
the
world
banishment
imprisonment
and
torture
were
in
vain
tried
to
shake
the
constancy
of
her
faith
and
at
last
she
was
bound
upon
the
for
a
cruel
death
but
the
angels
descended
so
says
the
story
rent
the
wheel
and
bore
her
away
through
the
air
far
over
the
sea
to
mount
sinai
where
her
body
was
left
to
repose
and
her
soul
ascended
with
them
to
heaven
the
charmer
however
you
and
simmias
appear
to
me
as
if
you
wished
to
sift
this
subject
more
thoroughly
and
to
be
afraid
like
children
lest
on
the
departure
from
the
body
winds
should
blow
it
away
upon
this
cebes
said
to
teach
us
better
socrates
perhaps
there
is
a
childish
spirit
in
our
breast
that
has
such
a
dread
let
us
endeavor
to
persuade
him
not
to
be
afraid
of
death
as
of
hobgoblins
you
must
charm
him
every
day
said
socrates
you
have
quieted
his
fears
whence
o
socrates
he
said
we
procure
a
skilful
charmer
for
such
a
case
now
you
are
about
to
leave
us
is
wide
cebes
he
said
in
it
surely
there
are
skilful
men
and
there
are
many
barbarous
nations
all
of
which
you
should
search
seeking
such
a
charmer
sparing
neither
money
nor
toil
last
words
of
socrates
as
narrated
by
plato
in
the
we
need
that
charmer
for
our
hearts
are
sore
with
longings
for
the
things
that
may
not
be
faint
for
the
friends
that
shall
return
no
more
dark
with
distrust
or
wrung
with
agony
what
is
this
life
and
what
to
us
is
death
whence
came
we
whither
go
and
where
are
those
who
in
a
moment
stricken
from
our
side
passed
to
that
land
of
shadow
and
repose
and
are
they
all
dust
and
dust
must
we
become
or
are
they
living
in
some
unknown
clime
shall
we
regain
them
in
that
home
and
live
anew
beyond
the
waves
of
time
o
man
divine
on
thee
our
souls
have
hung
thou
wert
our
teacher
in
these
questions
high
but
ah
this
day
divides
thee
from
our
side
and
veils
in
dust
thy
eye
where
is
that
charmer
whom
thou
bidst
us
seek
on
what
far
shores
may
his
sweet
voice
be
heard
when
shall
these
questions
of
our
yearning
souls
be
answered
by
the
bright
eternal
word
so
spake
the
youth
of
athens
weeping
round
when
socrates
lay
calmly
down
to
die
so
spake
the
sage
prophetic
of
the
hour
when
earth
fair
morning
star
should
rise
on
high
they
found
him
not
those
youths
of
soul
divine
long
seeking
wandering
watching
on
life
shore
reasoning
aspiring
yearning
for
the
light
death
came
and
found
them
doubting
as
before
but
years
passed
on
and
lo
the
charmer
came
pure
simple
sweet
as
comes
the
silver
dew
and
the
world
knew
him
not
he
walked
alone
encircled
only
by
his
trusting
few
like
the
athenian
sage
rejected
scorned
betrayed
condemned
his
day
of
doom
drew
nigh
he
drew
his
faithful
few
more
closely
round
and
told
them
that
his
hour
was
come
to
die
let
not
your
heart
be
troubled
then
he
said
my
father
house
hath
mansions
large
and
fair
i
go
before
you
to
prepare
your
place
i
will
return
to
take
you
with
me
there
and
since
that
hour
the
awful
foe
is
charmed
and
life
and
death
are
glorified
and
fair
whither
he
went
we
know
the
way
we
know
and
with
firm
step
press
on
to
meet
him
there
knocking
behold
i
stand
at
the
door
and
knock
knocking
knocking
ever
knocking
who
is
there
is
a
pilgrim
strange
and
kingly
never
such
was
seen
before
ah
sweet
soul
for
such
a
wonder
undo
the
door
no
that
door
is
hard
to
open
hinges
rusty
latch
is
broken
bid
him
go
wherefore
with
that
knocking
dreary
scare
the
sleep
from
one
so
weary
say
him
no
illustration
knocking
knocking
ever
knocking
what
still
there
o
sweet
soul
but
once
behold
him
with
the
hair
and
those
eyes
so
strange
and
tender
waiting
there
open
open
once
behold
him
him
so
fair
ah
that
door
why
wilt
thou
vex
me
coming
ever
to
perplex
me
for
the
key
is
stiffly
rusty
and
the
bolt
is
clogged
and
dusty
seals
it
fast
with
twist
and
twine
weeds
of
years
and
years
before
choke
the
passage
of
that
door
knocking
knocking
what
still
knocking
he
still
there
what
the
hour
the
night
is
waning
in
my
heart
a
drear
complaining
and
a
chilly
sad
unrest
ah
this
knocking
it
disturbs
me
scares
my
sleep
with
dreams
unblest
give
me
rest
rest
ah
rest
rest
dear
soul
he
longs
to
give
thee
thou
hast
only
dreamed
of
pleasure
dreamed
of
gifts
and
golden
treasure
dreamed
of
jewels
in
thy
keeping
waked
to
weariness
of
weeping
open
to
thy
soul
one
lover
and
thy
night
of
dreams
is
over
the
true
gifts
he
brings
have
seeming
more
than
all
thy
faded
dreaming
did
she
open
doth
she
will
she
so
as
wondering
we
behold
grows
the
picture
to
a
sign
pressed
upon
your
soul
and
mine
for
in
every
breast
that
liveth
is
that
strange
mysterious
door
though
forsaken
and
betangled
and
dusty
rusty
and
forgotten
there
the
piercéd
hand
still
knocketh
and
with
watching
with
the
sad
eyes
true
and
tender
with
the
hair
still
a
god
is
waiting
there
the
old
psalm
tune
you
asked
dear
friend
the
other
day
why
still
my
charméd
ear
rejoiceth
in
uncultured
tone
that
old
psalm
tune
to
hear
i
heard
full
oft
in
foreign
lands
the
grand
orchestral
strain
where
music
ancient
masters
live
revealed
on
earth
again
where
breathing
solemn
instruments
in
swaying
clouds
of
sound
bore
up
the
yearning
trancéd
soul
like
silver
wings
around
i
heard
in
old
peter
dome
where
clouds
of
incense
rise
most
ravishing
the
choral
swell
mount
upwards
to
the
skies
and
well
i
feel
the
magic
power
when
skilled
and
cultured
art
its
cunning
webs
of
sweetness
weaves
around
the
captured
heart
but
yet
dear
friend
though
rudely
sung
that
old
psalm
tune
hath
still
a
pulse
of
power
beyond
them
all
my
inmost
soul
to
thrill
those
halting
tones
that
sound
to
you
are
not
the
tones
i
hear
but
voices
of
the
loved
and
lost
there
meet
my
longing
ear
i
hear
my
angel
mother
voice
those
were
the
words
she
sung
i
hear
my
brother
ringing
tones
as
once
on
earth
they
rung
and
friends
that
walk
in
white
above
come
round
me
like
a
cloud
and
far
above
those
earthly
notes
their
singing
sounds
aloud
there
may
be
discord
as
you
say
those
voices
poorly
ring
but
there
no
discord
in
the
strain
those
upper
spirits
sing
for
they
who
sing
are
of
the
blest
the
calm
and
glorified
whose
hours
are
one
eternal
rest
on
heaven
sweet
floating
tide
their
life
is
music
and
accord
their
souls
and
hearts
keep
time
in
one
sweet
concert
with
the
lord
one
concert
vast
sublime
and
through
the
hymns
they
sang
on
earth
sometimes
a
sweetness
falls
on
those
they
loved
and
left
below
and
softly
homeward
calls
bells
from
our
own
dear
fatherland
borne
trembling
the
sea
the
narrow
sea
that
they
have
crossed
the
shores
where
we
shall
be
o
sing
sing
on
beloved
souls
sing
cares
and
griefs
to
rest
sing
till
entrancéd
we
arise
to
join
you
the
blest
the
other
world
it
lies
around
us
like
a
cloud
a
world
we
do
not
see
yet
the
sweet
closing
of
an
eye
may
bring
us
there
to
be
its
gentle
breezes
fan
our
cheek
amid
our
worldly
cares
its
gentle
voices
whisper
love
and
mingle
with
our
prayers
sweet
hearts
around
us
throb
and
beat
sweet
helping
hands
are
stirred
and
palpitates
the
veil
between
with
breathings
almost
heard
the
silence
awful
sweet
and
calm
they
have
no
power
to
break
for
mortal
words
are
not
for
them
to
utter
or
partake
so
thin
so
soft
so
sweet
they
glide
so
near
to
press
they
seem
they
lull
us
gently
to
our
rest
they
melt
into
our
dream
and
in
the
hush
of
rest
they
bring
is
easy
now
to
see
how
lovely
and
how
sweet
a
pass
the
hour
of
death
may
be
to
close
the
eye
and
close
the
ear
wrapped
in
a
trance
of
bliss
and
gently
drawn
in
loving
arms
to
swoon
to
that
from
this
scarce
knowing
if
we
wake
or
sleep
scarce
asking
where
we
are
to
feel
all
evil
sink
away
all
sorrow
and
all
care
sweet
souls
around
us
watch
us
still
press
nearer
to
our
side
into
our
thoughts
into
our
prayers
with
gentle
helpings
glide
let
death
between
us
be
as
naught
a
dried
and
vanished
stream
your
joy
be
the
reality
our
suffering
life
the
dream
mary
at
the
cross
now
there
stood
by
the
cross
of
jesus
his
mother
o
wondrous
mother
since
the
dawn
of
time
was
ever
love
was
ever
grief
like
thine
o
highly
favored
in
thy
joy
deep
flow
and
favored
even
in
this
thy
bitterest
woe
poor
was
that
home
in
simple
nazareth
where
fairly
growing
like
some
silent
flower
last
of
a
kingly
race
unknown
and
lowly
o
desert
lily
passed
thy
childhood
hour
the
world
knew
not
the
tender
serious
maiden
who
through
deep
loving
years
so
silent
grew
full
of
high
thought
and
holy
aspiration
which
the
god
alone
might
view
illustration
and
then
it
came
that
message
from
the
highest
such
as
to
woman
before
descended
the
almighty
wings
thy
prayerful
soul
and
with
thy
life
the
life
of
worlds
was
blended
what
visions
then
of
future
glory
filled
thee
the
chosen
mother
of
that
king
unknown
mother
fulfiller
of
all
prophecy
which
through
dim
ages
wondering
seers
had
shown
well
did
thy
dark
eye
kindle
thy
deep
soul
rise
into
billows
and
thy
heart
rejoice
then
woke
the
poet
fire
the
prophet
song
tuned
with
strange
burning
words
thy
timid
voice
then
in
dark
contrast
came
the
lowly
manger
the
outcast
shed
the
tramp
of
brutal
feet
again
behold
earth
learned
and
her
lowly
sages
and
shepherds
prostrate
at
thy
feet
then
to
the
temple
bearing
hark
again
what
strange
conflicting
tones
of
prophecy
breathe
the
child
foreshadowing
words
of
joy
high
triumph
blent
with
bitter
agony
o
highly
favored
thou
in
many
an
hour
spent
in
lone
musings
with
thy
wondrous
son
when
thou
didst
gaze
into
that
glorious
eye
and
hold
that
mighty
hand
within
thine
own
blest
through
those
thirty
years
when
in
thy
dwelling
he
lived
a
god
disguised
with
unknown
power
and
thou
his
sole
adorer
his
best
love
trusting
revering
waited
for
his
hour
blest
in
that
hour
when
called
by
opening
heaven
with
cloud
and
voice
and
the
baptizing
flame
up
from
the
jordan
walked
th
acknowledged
stranger
and
crowds
grew
silent
as
he
came
blessed
when
full
of
grace
with
glory
crowned
he
from
both
hands
almighty
favors
poured
and
though
he
had
not
where
to
lay
his
head
brought
to
his
feet
alike
the
slave
and
lord
crowds
followed
thousands
shouted
lo
our
king
fast
beat
thy
heart
now
now
the
hour
draws
nigh
behold
the
crown
the
throne
the
nations
bend
ah
no
fond
mother
no
behold
him
die
now
by
that
cross
thou
thy
final
station
and
the
last
dark
trial
of
thy
son
not
with
weak
tears
or
woman
lamentation
but
with
high
silent
anguish
like
his
own
hail
highly
favored
even
in
this
deep
passion
hail
in
this
bitter
anguish
thou
art
blest
blest
in
the
holy
power
with
him
to
suffer
those
deep
that
lead
to
higher
rest
all
now
is
darkness
and
in
that
deep
stillness
the
wrestles
with
that
mighty
woe
hark
to
that
cry
the
rock
of
ages
rending
is
finished
mother
all
is
glory
now
by
sufferings
mighty
as
his
mighty
soul
hath
the
redeemer
risen
forever
blest
and
through
all
ages
must
his
through
the
same
baptism
enter
the
same
rest
the
inner
voice
come
ye
yourselves
into
a
desert
place
and
rest
awhile
for
there
were
many
coming
and
going
so
that
they
had
no
time
so
much
as
to
eat
the
mad
whirl
of
life
its
dim
confusion
its
jarring
discords
and
poor
vanity
breathing
like
music
over
troubled
waters
what
gentle
voice
o
christian
speaks
to
thee
it
is
a
stranger
not
of
earth
or
earthly
by
the
serene
deep
fulness
of
that
eye
by
the
calm
pitying
smile
the
gesture
lowly
it
is
thy
saviour
as
he
passeth
by
come
come
he
saith
o
soul
oppressed
and
weary
come
to
the
shadows
of
my
desert
rest
come
walk
with
me
far
from
life
babbling
discords
and
peace
shall
breathe
like
music
in
thy
breast
art
thou
bewildered
by
contesting
voices
sick
to
thy
soul
of
party
noise
and
strife
come
leave
it
all
and
seek
that
solitude
where
thou
shalt
learn
of
me
a
purer
life
when
far
behind
the
world
great
tumult
dieth
thou
shalt
look
back
and
wonder
at
its
roar
but
its
far
voice
shall
seem
to
thee
a
dream
its
power
to
vex
thy
holier
life
be
there
shalt
thou
learn
the
secret
of
a
power
mine
to
bestow
which
heals
the
ills
of
living
to
overcome
by
love
to
live
by
prayer
to
conquer

mystic
word
of
thine

each
selfish
low
desire
and
keep
my
soul
as
thine
calm
and
divine
as
some
rare
perfume
in
a
vase
of
clay
pervades
it
with
a
fragrance
not
its
own
so
when
thou
dwellest
in
a
mortal
soul
all
heaven

sweetness
seems
around
it
thrown

in
me
there
have
been
moments
blest
when
i

heard
thy
voice
and
felt
thy
power

grasp
and
passion
hushed

divine
enchantment
of
the
hour

in
thee

shalt
keep
them
in

strife
of
tongues

ocean
and

with
angry
roar

in
the
fair
gardens
of
celestial
peace
walketh
a
gardener
in
meekness
clad
fair
are
the
flowers
that
wreathe
his
dewy
locks
and
his
mysterious
eyes
are
sweet
and
sad
fair
are
the
silent
foldings
of
his
robes
falling
with
saintly
calmness
to
his
feet
and
when
he
walks
each
floweret
to
his
will
with
living
pulse
of
sweet
accord
doth
beat
every
green
leaf
thrills
to
its
tender
heart
in
the
mild
summer
radiance
of
his
eye
no
fear
of
storm
or
cold
or
bitter
frost
shadows
the
flowerets
when
their
sun
is
nigh
and
all
our
pleasant
haunts
of
earthly
love
are
nurseries
to
those
gardens
of
the
air
and
his
eye
with
starry
beam
watcheth
the
growing
of
his
treasures
there
we
call
them
ours
with
selfish
tears
with
restless
longings
night
and
day
forgetful
of
the
high
mysterious
right
he
holds
to
bear
our
cherished
plants
away
but
when
some
sunny
spot
in
those
bright
fields
needs
the
fair
presence
of
an
added
flower
down
sweeps
a
starry
angel
in
the
night
at
morn
the
rose
has
vanished
from
our
bower
where
stood
our
tree
our
flower
there
is
a
grave
blank
silent
vacant
but
in
worlds
above
like
a
new
star
outblossomed
in
the
skies
the
angels
hail
an
added
flower
of
love
dear
friend
no
more
upon
that
lonely
mound
strewed
with
the
red
and
yellow
autumn
leaf
drop
thou
the
tear
but
raise
the
fainting
eye
beyond
the
autumn
mists
of
earthly
grief
thy
garden
bore
within
its
breast
those
mysteries
of
color
warm
and
bright
that
the
bleak
climate
of
this
lower
sphere
could
never
waken
into
form
and
light
yes
the
sweet
gardener
hath
borne
her
hence
nor
must
thou
ask
to
take
her
thence
away
thou
shalt
behold
her
in
some
coming
hour
in
his
fields
of
cloudless
day
the
crocus
beneath
the
sunny
autumn
sky
with
gold
leaves
dropping
round
we
sought
my
little
friend
and
i
the
consecrated
ground
where
calm
beneath
the
holy
cross
by
sweet
skies
sleeps
tranquilly
that
youthful
form
those
blue
unclouded
eyes
around
the
soft
green
swelling
mound
we
scooped
the
earth
away
and
buried
deep
the
against
a
coming
day
these
roots
are
dry
and
brown
and
sere
why
plant
them
here
he
said
to
leave
them
all
the
winter
long
so
desolate
and
dead
dear
child
within
each
sere
dead
form
there
sleeps
a
living
flower
and
it
shall
arise
in
spring
returning
hour
ah
deeper
down
cold
dark
and
chill
we
buried
our
heart
flower
but
shall
he
arise
in
spring
immortal
hour
in
blue
and
yellow
from
its
grave
springs
up
the
crocus
fair
and
god
shall
raise
those
bright
blue
eyes
those
sunny
waves
of
hair
not
for
a
fading
summer
morn
not
for
a
fleeting
hour
but
for
an
endless
age
of
bliss
shall
rise
our
heart
dear
flower
consolation
written
after
the
second
battle
of
bull
run
and
i
saw
a
new
heaven
and
a
new
earth
for
the
first
heaven
and
the
first
earth
were
passed
away
and
there
was
no
more
sea
ah
and
angry
how
the
waves
beat
turbulent
with
terrible
uproar
is
there
no
rest
from
tossing
no
repose
where
shall
we
find
a
haven
and
a
shore
what
is
secure
from
the
wave
there
go
our
riches
and
our
hopes
fly
there
there
go
the
faces
of
our
best
beloved
whelmed
in
the
vortex
of
its
wild
despair
whose
son
is
safe
whose
brother
and
whose
home
the
dashing
spray
beats
out
the
household
fire
by
blackened
ashes
weep
our
widowed
souls
over
the
embers
of
our
lost
desire
by
pauses
in
the
fitful
moaning
storm
we
hear
triumphant
notes
of
battle
roll
too
soon
the
triumph
sinks
in
funeral
wail
the
muffled
drum
the
death
march
shakes
the
soul
rocks
on
all
sides
and
breakers
at
the
helm
weak
human
hand
and
weary
human
eyes
the
shout
and
clamor
of
our
dreary
strife
goes
up
conflicting
to
the
angry
skies
but
for
all
this
o
timid
hearts
be
strong
be
of
good
cheer
for
though
the
storm
must
be
hath
its
master
from
the
depths
shall
rise
new
heavens
new
earth
where
shall
be
no
more
sea
no
sea
no
tossing
no
unrestful
storm
forever
past
the
anguish
and
the
strife
the
poor
old
weary
earth
shall
bloom
again
with
the
bright
foliage
of
that
better
life
and
war
and
strife
and
hatred
shall
be
past
and
misery
be
a
forgotten
dream
the
shepherd
god
shall
lead
his
peaceful
fold
by
the
calm
meadows
and
the
quiet
stream
be
still
be
still
and
know
that
he
is
god
be
calm
be
trustful
work
and
watch
and
pray
till
from
the
throes
of
this
last
anguish
rise
the
light
and
gladness
of
that
better
day
only
a
year
one
year
ago
a
ringing
voice
a
clear
blue
eye
and
clustering
curls
of
sunny
hair
too
fair
to
die
only
a
year
no
voice
no
smile
no
glance
of
eye
no
clustering
curls
of
golden
hair
fair
but
to
die
one
year
ago
what
loves
what
schemes
far
into
life
what
joyous
hopes
what
high
resolves
what
generous
strife
the
silent
picture
on
the
wall
the
burial
stone
of
all
that
beauty
life
and
joy
remain
alone
one
year
one
year
one
little
year
and
so
much
gone
and
yet
the
even
flow
of
life
moves
calmly
on
the
grave
grows
green
the
flowers
bloom
fair
above
that
head
no
sorrowing
tint
of
leaf
or
spray
says
he
is
dead
no
pause
or
hush
of
merry
birds
that
sing
above
tells
us
how
coldly
sleeps
below
the
form
we
love
where
hast
thou
been
this
year
beloved
what
hast
thou
seen
what
visions
fair
what
glorious
life
where
thou
hast
been
the
veil
the
veil
so
thin
so
strong
us
and
thee
the
mystic
veil
when
shall
it
fall
that
we
may
see
not
dead
not
sleeping
not
even
gone
but
present
still
and
waiting
for
the
coming
hour
of
god
sweet
will
lord
of
the
living
and
the
dead
our
saviour
dear
we
lay
in
silence
at
thy
feet
this
sad
sad
year
illustration
below
loudly
sweep
the
winds
of
autumn
that
lone
beloved
grave
where
we
laid
those
sunny
ringlets
when
those
blue
eyes
set
like
stars
leaving
us
to
outer
darkness
o
the
longing
and
the
aching
o
the
sere
deserted
grave
let
the
grass
turn
brown
upon
thee
brown
and
withered
like
our
dreams
let
the
wind
moan
through
the
with
a
dreary
whistle
sweep
the
dead
leaves
on
its
bosom
moaning
sobbing
through
the
branches
where
the
summer
laughed
so
gayly
he
is
gone
our
boy
of
summer
gone
the
light
of
his
blue
eyes
gone
the
tender
heart
and
manly
gone
the
dreams
and
the
aspirings
nothing
but
the
remaineth
and
the
aching
in
our
bosoms
ever
aching
ever
throbbing
who
shall
bring
it
unto
rest
above
a
vision
coming
down
a
golden
street
i
beheld
my
vanished
one
and
he
moveth
on
a
cloud
and
his
forehead
wears
a
star
and
his
blue
eyes
deep
and
holy
fixed
as
in
a
blessed
dream
see
some
mystery
of
joy
some
unuttered
depth
of
love
and
his
vesture
is
as
blue
as
the
skies
of
summer
are
falling
with
a
saintly
sweep
with
a
sacred
stillness
swaying
and
he
presseth
to
his
bosom
harp
of
strange
and
mystic
fashion
and
his
hands
like
living
pearls
wander
the
golden
strings
and
the
music
that
ariseth
who
can
utter
or
divine
it
in
that
strange
celestial
thrilling
every
memory
of
sorrow
every
every
anguish
every
fear
for
the
melt
away
in
charméd
rest
and
there
be
around
him
many
bright
with
robes
like
evening
clouds
tender
green
and
clearest
amber
crimson
fading
into
rose
robes
of
flames
and
robes
of
silver
and
their
hues
all
thrill
and
tremble
with
a
living
light
of
feeling
deepening
with
each
heart
pulsation
till
in
vivid
trance
of
color
that
celestial
rainbow
glows
how
they
float
and
wreathe
and
brighten
bending
low
their
starry
brows
singing
with
a
tender
cadence
and
their
hands
like
spotless
lilies
folded
on
their
prayerful
breasts
in
their
singing
seem
to
mingle
tender
airs
of
days
by
the
cradle
by
the
grave
songs
of
human
love
and
sorrow
songs
of
endless
love
and
rest
in
the
pauses
of
that
music
every
throb
of
sorrow
dies
o
my
own
my
heart
belovéd
vainly
have
i
wept
above
thee
would
i
call
thee
from
thy
glory
to
this
world
impurity
lo
it
passeth
it
dissolveth
all
the
vision
melts
away
but
as
if
a
heavenly
lily
dropped
into
my
aching
breast
with
a
healing
sweetness
laden
with
a
mystic
breath
of
rest
i
am
charmed
into
forgetting
autumn
winds
and
dreary
grave
lines
suggested
by
the
death
of
mrs
professor
stuart
of
andover
mass
how
quiet
through
the
hazy
autumn
air
the
wave
with
many
a
leaf
how
calmly
float
the
dreamy
mantled
clouds
through
these
still
days
of
autumn
fair
and
brief
our
andover
stands
thoughtful
fair
and
calm
waiting
to
lay
her
summer
glories
by
the
bright
flush
shall
kindle
all
her
pines
and
her
woods
blaze
with
autumn
heraldry
by
the
old
mossy
wall
the
waves
as
aforetime
and
the
purple
sprays
of
starry
asters
quiver
to
the
breeze
rustling
all
stilly
through
the
forest
ways
no
voice
of
triumph
from
those
silent
skies
breaks
on
the
calm
and
speaks
of
glories
near
nor
bright
wings
flutter
nor
fair
glistening
robes
proclaim
that
heavenly
messengers
are
here
yet
in
our
midst
an
angel
hath
come
down
troubling
the
waters
in
a
peaceful
home
and
from
that
home
of
life
long
sickness
healed
a
saint
hath
risen
where
pain
no
more
may
come
christ
fair
elect
one
from
a
hidden
life
of
loving
deeds
and
words
of
gentleness
hath
passed
where
all
are
loving
and
beloved
beyond
all
weariness
and
all
distress
calm
like
a
lamb
in
shepherd
bosom
borne
quiet
and
trustful
hath
she
sunk
to
rest
god
breathed
in
tenderness
the
sweet
well
done
that
scarce
awoke
a
trance
so
still
and
blest
ye
who
remember
the
long
loving
years
the
patient
mother
hourly
martyrdom
the
wisdom
the
calm
trust
rejoice
for
her
whose
day
of
rest
is
come
father
and
mother
now
united
stand
waiting
for
you
to
bind
the
household
chain
the
tent
is
struck
the
home
is
gone
before
and
tarries
for
you
on
the
heavenly
plain
by
every
wish
repressed
and
hope
resigned
each
cross
accepted
and
each
sorrow
borne
she
dead
yet
speaketh
she
doth
beckon
you
to
tread
the
path
her
patient
feet
have
worn
each
year
that
world
grows
richer
and
more
dear
with
the
bright
freight
washed
from
life
stormy
shore
o
goodly
clime
how
lovely
is
thy
strand
with
those
dear
faces
seen
on
earth
no
more
the
veil
between
this
world
and
that
to
come
grows
tremulous
and
quivers
with
their
breath
dimly
we
hear
their
voices
see
their
hands
inviting
us
to
the
release
of
death
o
thou
in
whom
thy
saints
above
below
are
one
and
undivided
grant
us
grace
in
patience
yet
to
bear
our
daily
cross
in
patience
run
our
hourly
shortening
race
and
while
on
earth
we
wear
the
servant
form
and
while

labors
ever
toilful
be
breathe
in
our
souls
the
joyful
confidence
we
are
already
kings
and
priests
with
thee
summer
studies
why
shouldst
thou
study
in
the
month
of

in
dusky
books
of
greek
and
hebrew
lore
when
the
great
teacher
of
all
glorious

the
sorrows
of

dedicated
to
the
mothers
who
have
lost
sons
in
the
late
war
i
slept
but
my
heart
was
waking
and
out
in
my
dreams
i
sped
through
the
streets
of
an
ancient
city
where
jesus
the
lord
lay
dead
he
was
lying
all
cold
and
lowly
and
the
sepulchre
was
sealed
and
the
women
that
bore
the
spices
had
come
from
the
holy
field
there
is
feasting
in
pilate
palace
there
is
revel
in
herod
hall
where
the
lute
and
the
sounding
instrument
to
mirth
and
merriment
call
i
have
washed
my
hands
said
pilate
and
what
is
the
jew
to
me
i
have
missed
my
chance
said
herod
one
of
his
wonders
to
see
but
why
should
our
courtly
circle
to
the
thought
give
further
place
all
dreams
save
of
pleasure
and
beauty
bid
the
dancers
feet
efface
i
saw
a
light
from
a
casement
and
entered
a
lowly
door
where
a
woman
stricken
and
mournful
sat
in
sackcloth
on
the
floor
there
mary
the
mother
of
jesus
and
john
the
belovéd
one
with
a
few
poor
friends
beside
them
were
mourning
for
him
that
was
gone
and
before
the
mother
was
lying
that
crown
of
cruel
thorn
wherewith
they
crowned
that
gentle
brow
in
mockery
that
morn
and
her
ears
yet
ring
with
the
anguish
of
that
last
dying
cry
that
mighty
appeal
of
agony
that
shook
both
earth
and
sky
o
god
what
a
shaft
of
anguish
was
that
dying
voice
from
the
tree
from
him
the
only
spotless
why
hast
thou
forsaken
me
and
was
he
of
god
forsaken
they
ask
appalled
with
dread
is
evil
crowned
and
triumphant
and
goodness
vanquished

dead
is

no

star

dare
to
be
firm
in
his
service
hereafter
to
trust
in
his
wisdom

care
so
darkly
the
tempter
was
saying
to
hearts
that
with
sorrow
were
dumb
and
the
poor
souls
were
clinging
in
darkness
to
god
with
hands
that
with
anguish
were
numb
in
my
dreams
came
the
third
day
morning
and
fairly
the
shone

fairer
the
solemn
angel
as
he
rolled
away
the
stone
in
the
lowly
dwelling
of
mary
in
the
dusky
twilight
chill
there
was
heard
the
sound
of
coming
feet
and
her
very
heart
grew
still
and
in
the
glimmer
of
dawning
she
saw
him
enter
the
door
her
son
all
living

real
risen

where
our
afternoons
went
by
where
the
suns
of
march
flushed
warmly
and
spring
was
in
earth
and
sky
out
of
the
mouldering
city
mouldering
old
and
gray
we
sped
with
a
lightsome
for
a
sunny
gladsome
day
for
a
revel
of
fresh
spring
verdure
for
a
race
springing
flowers
for
a
vision
of
plashing
fountains
of
birds
and
blossoming
bowers
there
were
violet
banks
in
the
shadows
violets
white
and
blue
and
a
world
of
bright
anemones
that
over
the
terrace
grew
blue
and
orange
and
purple
rosy
and
yellow
and
white
rising
in
rainbow
bubbles
streaking
the
lawns
with
light
and
down
from
the
old
stone
those
far
off
islands
of
air
the
birds
are
flinging
the
tidings
of
a
joyful
revel
up
there
and
now
for
the
grand
old
fountains
tossing
their
silvery
spray
those
fountains
so
quaint
and
so
many
that
are
leaping
and
singing
all
day
those
fountains
of
strange
weird
sculpture
with
lichens
and
moss
are
they
marble
greening
in
or
whitening
to
stone
down
many
a
wild
dim
pathway
we
ramble
from
morning
till
noon
we
linger
unheeding
the
hours
till
evening
comes
all
too
soon
and
from
out
the
ilex
alleys
where
lengthening
shadows
play
we
look
on
the
dreamy
campagna
all
glowing
with
setting
day
all
melting
in
bands
of
purple
in
swathings
and
foldings
of
gold
in
ribands
of
azure
and
lilac
like
a
princely
banner
unrolled
and
the
smoke
of
each
distant
cottage
and
the
flash
of
each
villa
white
shines
out
with
an
opal
glimmer
like
gems
in
a
casket
of
light
and
the
dome
of
old
with
a
strange
translucence
glows
like
a
mighty
bubble
of
amethyst
floating
in
waves
of
rose
in
a
trance
of
dreamy
vagueness
we
gazing
and
yearning
behold
that
city
beheld
by
the
prophet
whose
walls
were
transparent
gold
and
dropping
all
solemn
and
slowly
to
hallow
the
softening
spell
there
falls
on
the
dying
twilight
the
ave
maria
bell
with
a
mournful
motherly
softness
with
a
weird
and
weary
care
that
strange
and
ancient
city
seems
calling
the
nations
to
prayer
and
the
words
that
of
old
the
angel
to
the
mother
of
jesus
brought
rise
like
a
new
evangel
to
hallow
the
trance
of
our
thought
with
the
smoke
of
the
evening
incense
our
thoughts
are
ascending
then
to
mary
the
mother
of
jesus
to
jesus
the
master
of
men
o
city
of
prophets
and
martyrs
o
shrines
of
the
sainted
dead
when
when
shall
the
living
once
more
on
your
towers
be
spread
when
he
who
is
meek
and
lowly
shall
rule
in
those
lordly
halls
and
shall
stand
and
feed
as
a
shepherd
the
flock
which
his
mercy
calls
o
then
to
those
noble
churches
to
picture
and
statue
and
gem
to
the
pageant
of
solemn
worship
shall
the
come
back
again
and
this
strange
and
ancient
city
in
that
reign
of
his
truth
and
love
shall
what
it
in
the
twilight
the
type
of
that
city
above
the
gardens
of
the
vatican
sweet
fountains
plashing
with
a
dreamy
fall
and
mosses
green
and
tremulous
veils
of
fern
and
banks
of
blowing
cyclamen
and
stars
blue
as
the
skies
of
myrtle
blossoming
the
twilight
shade
of
ilex
overhead
with
sweet
song
of
nightingale
with
walks
of
strange
weird
stillness
leading
on
sculptured
fragments
half
to
green
moss
gone
or
breaking
forth
amid
the
violet
leaves
with
some
white
gleam
of
an
old
world
gone
by
ah
strange
sweet
quiet
wilderness
of
calm
gardens
of
dreamy
rest
i
long
to
lay
beneath
your
shade
the
last
long
sigh
and
say
here
is
my
home
my
lord
thy
home
and
mine
and
i
having
searched
the
world
with
many
a
tear
at
last
have
found
thee
and
will
stray
no
more
but
vainly
here
i
seek
the
gardener
that
mary
saw
these
lovely
halls
beyond
that
airy
dome
that
lofty
fane
is
as
a
palace
whence
the
king
is
gone
and
taken
all
the
sweetness
with
himself
turn
again
jesus
and
possess
thine
own
come
to
thy
temple
once
more
as
of
old
drive
forth
the
let
it
be
a
house
of
prayer
for
nations
even
so
amen
amen
peter
church
holy
week
april
o
fairest
mansion
of
a
father
love
harmonious
hospitable
with
thine
arms
outspread
to
all
thy
fountains
ever
full
and
fair
as
heaven
thy
misty
dome
hung
like
the
firmament
with
circling
sweep
above
the
constellated
golden
lamps
that
burn
forever
round
the
holy
tomb
most
meet
art
thou
to
be
the
father
house
the
house
of
prayer
for
nations
come
the
time
when
thou
shalt
be
so
when
a
liberty
wide
as
thine
arms
high
as
thy
lofty
dome
shall
be
proclaimed
by
thy
loud
singing
choirs
like
voice
of
many
waters
then
the
lord
shall
come
into
his
temple
and
make
pure
the
sons
of
levi
then
as
once
of
old
the
blind
shall
see
the
lame
leap
as
an
hart
and
to
the
poor
the
gospel
shall
be
preached
and
easter
trumpets
tell
the
lord
is
risen
indeed
to
die
no
more
hasten
it
in
its
time
amen
amen
the
miserere
not
of
the
earth
that
music
all
things
fade
vanish
the
pictured
walls
and
one
by
one
the
starry
candles
silently
expire
and
now
o
jesus
round
that
silent
cross
a
moment
pause
a
hush
as
of
the
grave
now
rises
slow
a
silver
mist
of
sound
and
all
the
heavens
break
out
in
drops
of
grief
a
rain
of
sobbing
sweetness
swelling
dying
voice
into
voice
inweaving
with
sweet
throbs
and
fluttering
pulses
of
impassioned
moan
veiled
voices
in
whose
wailing
there
is
awe
and
mysteries
of
love
and
agony
a
yearning
anguish
of
celestial
souls
a
shiver
as
of
wings
trembling
the
air
as
if
god
shining
doves
his
spotless
birds
wailed
with
a
nightingale
of
grief
in
this
their
starless
night
when
for
our
sins
their
sun
their
life
their
love
hangs
darkly
there
like
a
slain
lamb
bleeding
his
life
away
