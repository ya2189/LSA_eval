he
did
not
wear
his
scarlet
coat
for
blood
and
wine
are
red
and
blood
and
wine
were
on
his
hands
when
they
found
him
with
the
dead
the
poor
dead
woman
whom
he
loved
and
murdered
in
her
bed
he
walked
amongst
the
trial
men
in
a
suit
of
shabby
grey
a
cricket
cap
was
on
his
head
and
his
step
seemed
light
and
gay
but
i
never
saw
a
man
who
looked
so
wistfully
at
the
day
i
never
saw
a
man
who
looked
with
such
a
wistful
eye
upon
that
little
tent
of
blue
which
prisoners
call
the
sky
and
at
every
drifting
cloud
that
went
with
sails
of
silver
by
i
walked
with
other
souls
in
pain
within
another
ring
and
was
wondering
if
the
man
had
done
a
great
or
little
thing
when
a
voice
behind
me
whispered
low
that
fellow
got
to
swing
dear
christ
the
very
prison
walls
suddenly
seemed
to
reel
and
the
sky
above
my
head
became
like
a
casque
of
scorching
steel
and
though
i
was
a
soul
in
pain
my
pain
i
could
not
feel
i
only
knew
what
hunted
thought
quickened
his
step
and
why
he
looked
upon
the
garish
day
with
such
a
wistful
eye
the
man
had
killed
the
thing
he
loved
and
so
he
had
to
die
yet
each
man
kills
the
thing
he
loves
by
each
let
this
be
heard
some
do
it
with
a
bitter
look
some
with
a
flattering
word
the
coward
does
it
with
a
kiss
the
brave
man
with
a
sword
some
kill
their
love
when
they
are
young
and
some
when
they
are
old
some
strangle
with
the
hands
of
lust
some
with
the
hands
of
gold
the
kindest
use
a
knife
because
the
dead
so
soon
grow
cold
some
love
too
little
some
too
long
some
sell
and
others
buy
some
do
the
deed
with
many
tears
and
some
without
a
sigh
for
each
man
kills
the
thing
he
loves
yet
each
man
does
not
die
he
does
not
die
a
death
of
shame
on
a
day
of
dark
disgrace
nor
have
a
noose
about
his
neck
nor
a
cloth
upon
his
face
nor
drop
feet
foremost
through
the
floor
into
an
empty
place
he
does
not
sit
with
silent
men
who
watch
him
night
and
day
who
watch
him
when
he
tries
to
weep
and
when
he
tries
to
pray
who
watch
him
lest
himself
should
rob
the
prison
of
its
prey
he
does
not
wake
at
dawn
to
see
dread
figures
throng
his
room
the
shivering
chaplain
robed
in
white
the
sheriff
stern
with
gloom
and
the
governor
all
in
shiny
black
with
the
yellow
face
of
doom
he
does
not
rise
in
piteous
haste
to
put
on
while
some
doctor
gloats
and
notes
each
new
and
pose
fingering
a
watch
whose
little
ticks
are
like
horrible
he
does
not
know
that
sickening
thirst
that
sands
one
throat
before
the
hangman
with
his
gardener
gloves
slips
through
the
padded
door
and
binds
one
with
three
leathern
thongs
that
the
throat
may
thirst
no
more
he
does
not
bend
his
head
to
hear
the
burial
office
read
nor
while
the
terror
of
his
soul
tells
him
he
is
not
dead
cross
his
own
coffin
as
he
moves
into
the
hideous
shed
he
does
not
stare
upon
the
air
through
a
little
roof
of
glass
he
does
not
pray
with
lips
of
clay
for
his
agony
to
pass
nor
feel
upon
his
shuddering
cheek
the
kiss
of
caiaphas
ii
six
weeks
our
guardsman
walked
the
yard
in
a
suit
of
shabby
grey
his
cricket
cap
was
on
his
head
and
his
step
seemed
light
and
gay
but
i
never
saw
a
man
who
looked
so
wistfully
at
the
day
i
never
saw
a
man
who
looked
with
such
a
wistful
eye
upon
that
little
tent
of
blue
which
prisoners
call
the
sky
and
at
every
wandering
cloud
that
trailed
its
raveled
fleeces
by
he
did
not
wring
his
hands
as
do
those
witless
men
who
dare
to
try
to
rear
the
changeling
hope
in
the
cave
of
black
despair
he
only
looked
upon
the
sun
and
drank
the
morning
air
he
did
not
wring
his
hands
nor
weep
nor
did
he
peek
or
pine
but
he
drank
the
air
as
though
it
held
some
healthful
anodyne
with
open
mouth
he
drank
the
sun
as
though
it
had
been
wine
and
i
and
all
the
souls
in
pain
who
tramped
the
other
ring
forgot
if
we
ourselves
had
done
a
great
or
little
thing
and
watched
with
gaze
of
dull
amaze
the
man
who
had
to
swing
and
strange
it
was
to
see
him
pass
with
a
step
so
light
and
gay
and
strange
it
was
to
see
him
look
so
wistfully
at
the
day
and
strange
it
was
to
think
that
he
had
such
a
debt
to
pay
for
oak
and
elm
have
pleasant
leaves
that
in
the
shoot
but
grim
to
see
is
the
with
its
root
and
green
or
dry
a
man
must
die
before
it
bears
its
fruit
the
loftiest
place
is
that
seat
of
grace
for
which
all
worldlings
try
but
who
would
stand
in
hempen
band
upon
a
scaffold
high
and
through
a
murderer
collar
take
his
last
look
at
the
sky
it
is
sweet
to
dance
to
violins
when
love
and
life
are
fair
to
dance
to
flutes
to
dance
to
lutes
is
delicate
and
rare
but
it
is
not
sweet
with
nimble
feet
to
dance
upon
the
air
so
with
curious
eyes
and
sick
surmise
we
watched
him
day
by
day
and
wondered
if
each
one
of
us
would
end
the
way
for
none
can
tell
to
what
red
hell
his
sightless
soul
may
stray
at
last
the
dead
man
walked
no
more
amongst
the
trial
men
and
i
knew
that
he
was
standing
up
in
the
black
dock
dreadful
pen
and
that
never
would
i
see
his
face
in
god
sweet
world
again
like
two
doomed
ships
that
pass
in
storm
we
had
crossed
each
other
way
but
we
made
no
sign
we
said
no
word
we
had
no
word
to
say
for
we
did
not
meet
in
the
holy
night
but
in
the
shameful
day
a
prison
wall
was
round
us
both
two
outcast
men
were
we
the
world
had
thrust
us
from
its
heart
and
god
from
out
his
care
and
the
iron
gin
that
waits
for
sin
had
caught
us
in
its
snare
in
debtors
yard
the
stones
are
hard
and
the
dripping
wall
is
high
so
it
was
there
he
took
the
air
beneath
the
leaden
sky
and
by
each
side
a
warder
walked
for
fear
the
man
might
die
or
else
he
sat
with
those
who
watched
his
anguish
night
and
day
who
watched
him
when
he
rose
to
weep
and
when
he
crouched
to
pray
who
watched
him
lest
himself
should
rob
their
scaffold
of
its
prey
the
governor
was
strong
upon
the
regulations
act
the
doctor
said
that
death
was
but
a
scientific
fact
and
twice
a
day
the
chaplain
called
and
left
a
little
tract
and
twice
a
day
he
smoked
his
pipe
and
drank
his
quart
of
beer
his
soul
was
resolute
and
held
no
for
fear
he
often
said
that
he
was
glad
the
hangman
hands
were
near
but
why
he
said
so
strange
a
thing
no
warder
dared
to
ask
for
he
to
whom
a
watcher
doom
is
given
as
his
task
must
set
a
lock
upon
his
lips
and
make
his
face
a
mask
or
else
he
might
be
moved
and
try
to
comfort
or
console
and
what
should
human
pity
do
pent
up
in
murderers
hole
what
word
of
grace
in
such
a
place
could
help
a
brother
soul
with
slouch
and
swing
around
the
ring
we
trod
the
fool
parade
we
did
not
care
we
knew
we
were
the
devil
own
brigade
and
shaven
head
and
feet
of
lead
make
a
merry
masquerade
we
tore
the
tarry
rope
to
shreds
with
blunt
and
bleeding
nails
we
rubbed
the
doors
and
scrubbed
the
floors
and
cleaned
the
shining
rails
and
rank
by
rank
we
soaped
the
plank
and
clattered
with
the
pails
we
sewed
the
sacks
we
broke
the
stones
we
turned
the
dusty
drill
we
banged
the
tins
and
bawled
the
hymns
and
sweated
on
the
mill
but
in
the
heart
of
every
man
terror
was
lying
still
so
still
it
lay
that
every
day
crawled
like
a
wave
and
we
forgot
the
bitter
lot
that
waits
for
fool
and
knave
till
once
as
we
tramped
in
from
work
we
passed
an
open
grave
with
yawning
mouth
the
yellow
hole
gaped
for
a
living
thing
the
very
mud
cried
out
for
blood
to
the
thirsty
asphalte
ring
and
we
knew
that
ere
one
dawn
grew
fair
some
prisoner
had
to
swing
right
in
we
went
with
soul
intent
on
death
and
dread
and
doom
the
hangman
with
his
little
bag
went
shuffling
through
the
gloom
and
each
man
trembled
as
he
crept
into
his
numbered
tomb
that
night
the
empty
corridors
were
full
of
forms
of
fear
and
up
and
down
the
iron
town
stole
feet
we
could
not
hear
and
through
the
bars
that
hide
the
stars
white
faces
seemed
to
peer
he
lay
as
one
who
lies
and
dreams
in
a
pleasant
the
watcher
watched
him
as
he
slept
and
could
not
understand
how
one
could
sleep
so
sweet
a
sleep
with
a
hangman
close
at
hand
but
there
is
no
sleep
when
men
must
weep
who
never
yet
have
wept
so
we
the
fool
the
fraud
the
knave
that
endless
vigil
kept
and
through
each
brain
on
hands
of
pain
another
terror
crept
alas
it
is
a
fearful
thing
to
feel
another
guilt
for
right
within
the
sword
of
sin
pierced
to
its
poisoned
hilt
and
as
molten
lead
were
the
tears
we
shed
for
the
blood
we
had
not
spilt
the
warders
with
their
shoes
of
felt
crept
by
each
padlocked
door
and
peeped
and
saw
with
eyes
of
awe
grey
figures
on
the
floor
and
wondered
why
men
knelt
to
pray
who
never
prayed
before
all
through
the
night
we
knelt
and
prayed
mad
mourners
of
a
corpse
the
troubled
plumes
of
midnight
were
the
plumes
upon
a
hearse
and
bitter
wine
upon
a
sponge
was
the
savior
of
remorse
the
cock
crew
the
red
cock
crew
but
never
came
the
day
and
crooked
shape
of
terror
crouched
in
the
corners
where
we
lay
and
each
evil
sprite
that
walks
by
night
before
us
seemed
to
play
they
glided
past
they
glided
fast
like
travelers
through
a
mist
they
mocked
the
moon
in
a
rigadoon
of
delicate
turn
and
twist
and
with
formal
pace
and
loathsome
grace
the
phantoms
kept
their
tryst
with
mop
and
mow
we
saw
them
go
slim
shadows
hand
in
hand
about
about
in
ghostly
rout
they
trod
a
saraband
and
the
damned
grotesques
made
arabesques
like
the
wind
upon
the
sand
with
the
pirouettes
of
marionettes
they
tripped
on
pointed
tread
but
with
flutes
of
fear
they
filled
the
ear
as
their
grisly
masque
they
led
and
loud
they
sang
and
loud
they
sang
for
they
sang
to
wake
the
dead
oho
they
cried
the
world
is
wide
but
fettered
limbs
go
lame
and
once
or
twice
to
throw
the
dice
is
a
gentlemanly
game
but
he
does
not
win
who
plays
with
sin
in
the
secret
house
of
shame
no
things
of
air
these
antics
were
that
frolicked
with
such
glee
to
men
whose
lives
were
held
in
gyves
and
whose
feet
might
not
go
free
ah
wounds
of
christ
they
were
living
things
most
terrible
to
see
around
around
they
waltzed
and
wound
some
wheeled
in
smirking
pairs
with
the
mincing
step
of
demirep
some
sidled
up
the
stairs
and
with
subtle
sneer
and
fawning
leer
each
helped
us
at
our
prayers
the
morning
wind
began
to
moan
but
still
the
night
went
on
through
its
giant
loom
the
web
of
gloom
crept
till
each
thread
was
spun
and
as
we
prayed
we
grew
afraid
of
the
justice
of
the
sun
the
moaning
wind
went
wandering
round
the
weeping
till
like
a
wheel
of
we
felt
the
minutes
crawl
o
moaning
wind
what
had
we
done
to
have
such
a
seneschal
at
last
i
saw
the
shadowed
bars
like
a
lattice
wrought
in
lead
move
right
across
the
whitewashed
wall
that
faced
my
bed
and
i
knew
that
somewhere
in
the
world
god
dreadful
dawn
was
red
at
six
we
cleaned
our
cells
at
seven
all
was
still
but
the
sough
and
swing
of
a
mighty
wing
the
prison
seemed
to
fill
for
the
lord
of
death
with
icy
breath
had
entered
in
to
kill
he
did
not
pass
in
purple
pomp
nor
ride
a
steed
three
yards
of
cord
and
a
sliding
board
are
all
the
gallows
need
so
with
rope
of
shame
the
herald
came
to
do
the
secret
deed
we
were
as
men
who
through
a
fen
of
filthy
darkness
grope
we
did
not
dare
to
breathe
a
prayer
or
give
our
anguish
scope
something
was
dead
in
each
of
us
and
what
was
dead
was
hope
for
man
grim
justice
goes
its
way
and
will
not
swerve
aside
it
slays
the
weak
it
slays
the
strong
it
has
a
deadly
stride
with
iron
heel
it
slays
the
strong
the
monstrous
parricide
we
waited
for
the
stroke
of
eight
each
tongue
was
thick
with
thirst
for
the
stroke
of
eight
is
the
stroke
of
fate
that
makes
a
man
accursed
and
fate
will
use
a
running
noose
for
the
best
man
and
the
worst
we
had
no
other
thing
to
do
save
to
wait
for
the
sign
to
come
so
like
things
of
stone
in
a
valley
lone
quiet
we
sat
and
dumb
but
each
man
heart
beat
thick
and
quick
like
a
madman
on
a
drum
with
sudden
shock
the
smote
on
the
shivering
air
and
from
all
the
gaol
rose
up
a
wail
of
impotent
despair
like
the
sound
that
frightened
marshes
hear
from
a
leper
in
his
lair
and
as
one
sees
most
fearful
things
in
the
crystal
of
a
dream
we
saw
the
greasy
hempen
rope
hooked
to
the
blackened
beam
and
heard
the
prayer
the
hangman
snare
strangled
into
a
scream
and
all
the
woe
that
moved
him
so
that
he
gave
that
bitter
cry
and
the
wild
regrets
and
the
bloody
sweats
none
knew
so
well
as
i
for
he
who
live
more
lives
than
one
more
deaths
than
one
must
die
iv
there
is
no
chapel
on
the
day
on
which
they
hang
a
man
the
chaplain
heart
is
far
too
sick
or
his
face
is
far
to
wan
or
there
is
that
written
in
his
eyes
which
none
should
look
upon
so
they
kept
us
close
till
nigh
on
noon
and
then
they
rang
the
bell
and
the
warders
with
their
jingling
keys
opened
each
listening
cell
and
down
the
iron
stair
we
tramped
each
from
his
separate
hell
out
into
god
sweet
air
we
went
but
not
in
wonted
way
for
this
man
face
was
white
with
fear
and
that
man
face
was
grey
and
i
never
saw
sad
men
who
looked
so
wistfully
at
the
day
i
never
saw
sad
men
who
looked
with
such
a
wistful
eye
upon
that
little
tent
of
blue
we
prisoners
called
the
sky
and
at
every
careless
cloud
that
passed
in
happy
freedom
by
but
there
were
those
amongst
us
all
who
walked
with
downcast
head
and
knew
that
had
each
got
his
due
they
should
have
died
instead
he
had
but
killed
a
thing
that
lived
whilst
they
had
killed
the
dead
for
he
who
sins
a
second
time
wakes
a
dead
soul
to
pain
and
draws
it
from
its
spotted
shroud
and
makes
it
bleed
again
and
makes
it
bleed
great
gouts
of
blood
and
makes
it
bleed
in
vain
like
ape
or
clown
in
monstrous
garb
with
crooked
arrows
starred
silently
we
went
round
and
round
the
slippery
asphalte
yard
silently
we
went
round
and
round
and
no
man
spoke
a
word
silently
we
went
round
and
round
and
through
each
hollow
mind
the
memory
of
dreadful
things
rushed
like
a
dreadful
wind
an
horror
stalked
before
each
man
and
terror
crept
behind
the
warders
strutted
up
and
down
and
kept
their
herd
of
brutes
their
uniforms
were
spick
and
span
and
they
wore
their
sunday
suits
but
we
knew
the
work
they
had
been
at
by
the
quicklime
on
their
boots
for
where
a
grave
had
opened
wide
there
was
no
grave
at
all
only
a
stretch
of
mud
and
sand
by
the
hideous
and
a
little
heap
of
burning
lime
that
the
man
should
have
his
pall
for
he
has
a
pall
this
wretched
man
such
as
few
men
can
claim
deep
down
below
a
naked
for
greater
shame
he
lies
with
fetters
on
each
foot
wrapt
in
a
sheet
of
flame
and
all
the
while
the
burning
lime
eats
flesh
and
bone
away
it
eats
the
brittle
bone
by
night
and
the
soft
flesh
by
the
day
it
eats
the
flesh
and
bones
by
turns
but
it
eats
the
heart
alway
for
three
long
years
they
will
not
sow
or
root
or
seedling
there
for
three
long
years
the
unblessed
spot
will
sterile
be
and
bare
and
look
upon
the
wondering
sky
with
unreproachful
stare
they
think
a
murderer
heart
would
taint
each
simple
seed
they
sow
it
is
not
true
god
kindly
earth
is
kindlier
than
men
know
and
the
red
rose
would
but
blow
more
red
the
white
rose
whiter
blow
out
of
his
mouth
a
red
red
rose
out
of
his
heart
a
white
for
who
can
say
by
what
strange
way
christ
brings
his
will
to
light
since
the
barren
staff
the
pilgrim
bore
bloomed
in
the
great
pope
sight
but
neither
rose
nor
red
may
bloom
in
prison
air
the
shard
the
pebble
and
the
flint
are
what
they
give
us
there
for
flowers
have
been
known
to
heal
a
common
man
despair
so
never
will
rose
or
white
petal
by
petal
fall
on
that
stretch
of
mud
and
sand
that
lies
by
the
hideous
to
tell
the
men
who
tramp
the
yard
that
god
son
died
for
all
yet
though
the
hideous
still
hems
him
round
and
round
and
a
spirit
may
not
walk
by
night
that
is
with
fetters
bound
and
a
spirit
may
but
weep
that
lies
in
such
unholy
ground
he
is
at
peace
this
wretched
man
at
peace
or
will
be
soon
there
is
no
thing
to
make
him
mad
nor
does
terror
walk
at
noon
for
the
lampless
earth
in
which
he
lies
has
neither
sun
nor
moon
they
hanged
him
as
a
beast
is
hanged
they
did
not
even
toll
a
requiem
that
might
have
brought
rest
to
his
startled
soul
but
hurriedly
they
took
him
out
and
hid
him
in
a
hole
they
stripped
him
of
his
canvas
clothes
and
gave
him
to
the
flies
they
mocked
the
swollen
purple
throat
and
the
stark
and
staring
eyes
and
with
laughter
loud
they
heaped
the
shroud
in
which
their
convict
lies
the
chaplain
would
not
kneel
to
pray
by
his
dishonored
grave
nor
mark
it
with
that
blessed
cross
that
christ
for
sinners
gave
because
the
man
was
one
of
those
whom
christ
came
down
to
save
yet
all
is
well
he
has
but
passed
to
life
appointed
bourne
and
alien
tears
will
fill
for
him
pity
urn
for
his
mourner
will
be
outcast
men
and
outcasts
always
mourn
i
know
not
whether
laws
be
right
or
whether
laws
be
wrong
all
that
we
know
who
lie
in
gaol
is
that
the
wall
is
strong
and
that
each
day
is
like
a
year
a
year
whose
days
are
long
but
this
i
know
that
every
law
that
men
have
made
for
man
since
first
man
took
his
brother
life
and
the
sad
world
began
but
straws
the
wheat
and
saves
the
chaff
with
a
most
evil
fan
this
too
i
know
and
wise
it
were
if
each
could
know
the
same
that
every
prison
that
men
build
is
built
with
bricks
of
shame
and
bound
with
bars
lest
christ
should
see
how
men
their
brothers
maim
with
bars
they
blur
the
gracious
moon
and
blind
the
goodly
sun
and
they
do
well
to
hide
their
hell
for
in
it
things
are
done
that
son
of
god
nor
son
of
man
ever
should
look
upon
the
vilest
deeds
like
poison
weeds
bloom
well
in
it
is
only
what
is
good
in
man
that
wastes
and
withers
there
pale
anguish
keeps
the
heavy
gate
and
the
warder
is
despair
for
they
starve
the
little
frightened
child
till
it
weeps
both
night
and
day
and
they
scourge
the
weak
and
flog
the
fool
and
gibe
the
old
and
grey
and
some
grow
mad
and
all
grow
bad
and
none
a
word
may
say
each
narrow
cell
in
which
we
dwell
is
a
foul
and
dark
latrine
and
the
fetid
breath
of
living
death
chokes
up
each
grated
screen
and
all
but
lust
is
turned
to
dust
in
humanity
machine
the
brackish
water
that
we
drink
creeps
with
a
loathsome
slime
and
the
bitter
bread
they
weigh
in
scales
is
full
of
chalk
and
lime
and
sleep
will
not
lie
down
but
walks
and
cries
to
time
but
though
lean
hunger
and
green
thirst
like
asp
with
adder
fight
we
have
little
care
of
prison
fare
for
what
chills
and
kills
outright
is
that
every
stone
one
lifts
by
day
becomes
one
heart
by
night
with
midnight
always
in
one
heart
and
twilight
in
one
cell
we
turn
the
crank
or
tear
the
rope
each
in
his
separate
hell
and
the
silence
is
more
awful
far
than
the
sound
of
a
brazen
bell
and
never
a
human
voice
comes
near
to
speak
a
gentle
word
and
the
eye
that
watches
through
the
door
is
pitiless
and
hard
and
by
all
forgot
we
rot
and
rot
with
soul
and
body
marred
and
thus
we
rust
life
iron
chain
degraded
and
alone
and
some
men
curse
and
some
men
weep
and
some
men
make
no
moan
but
god
eternal
laws
are
kind
and
break
the
heart
of
stone
and
every
human
heart
that
breaks
in
or
yard
is
as
that
broken
box
that
gave
its
treasure
to
the
lord
and
filled
the
unclean
leper
house
with
the
scent
of
costliest
nard
ah
happy
day
they
whose
hearts
can
break
and
peace
of
pardon
win
how
else
may
man
make
straight
his
plan
and
cleanse
his
soul
from
sin
how
else
but
through
a
broken
heart
may
lord
christ
enter
in
and
he
of
the
swollen
purple
throat
and
the
stark
and
staring
eyes
waits
for
the
holy
hands
that
took
the
thief
to
paradise
and
a
broken
and
a
contrite
heart
the
lord
will
not
despise
the
man
in
red
who
reads
the
law
gave
him
three
weeks
of
life
three
little
weeks
in
which
to
heal
his
soul
of
his
soul
strife
and
cleanse
from
every
blot
of
blood
the
hand
that
held
the
knife
and
with
tears
of
blood
he
cleansed
the
hand
the
hand
that
held
the
steel
for
only
blood
can
wipe
out
blood
and
only
tears
can
heal
and
the
crimson
stain
that
was
of
cain
became
christ
seal
vi
in
reading
gaol
by
reading
town
there
is
a
pit
of
shame
and
in
it
lies
a
wretched
man
eaten
by
teeth
of
flame
in
burning
he
lies
and
his
grave
has
got
no
name
and
there
till
christ
call
forth
the
dead
in
silence
let
him
lie
no
need
to
waste
the
foolish
tear
or
heave
the
windy
sigh
the
man
had
killed
the
thing
he
loved
and
so
he
had
to
die
and
all
men
kill
the
thing
they
love
by
all
let
this
be
heard
some
do
it
with
a
bitter
look
some
with
a
flattering
word
the
coward
does
it
with
a
kiss
the
brave
man
with
a
sword
version
two
i
he
did
not
wear
his
scarlet
coat
for
blood
and
wine
are
red
and
blood
and
wine
were
on
his
hands
when
they
found
him
with
the
dead
the
poor
dead
woman
whom
he
loved
and
murdered
in
her
bed
he
walked
amongst
the
trial
men
in
a
suit
of
shabby
gray
a
cricket
cap
was
on
his
head
and
his
step
seemed
light
and
gay
but
i
never
saw
a
man
who
looked
so
wistfully
at
the
day
i
never
saw
a
man
who
looked
with
such
a
wistful
eye
upon
that
little
tent
of
blue
which
prisoners
call
the
sky
and
at
every
drifting
cloud
that
went
with
sails
of
silver
by
i
walked
with
other
souls
in
pain
within
another
ring
and
was
wondering
if
the
man
had
done
a
great
or
little
thing
when
a
voice
behind
me
whispered
low
that
fellow
got
to
swing
dear
christ
the
very
prison
walls
suddenly
seemed
to
reel
and
the
sky
above
my
head
became
like
a
casque
of
scorching
steel
and
though
i
was
a
soul
in
pain
my
pain
i
could
not
feel
i
only
knew
what
haunted
thought
quickened
his
step
and
why
he
looked
upon
the
garish
day
with
such
a
wistful
eye
the
man
had
killed
the
thing
he
loved
and
so
he
had
to
die
yet
each
man
kills
the
thing
he
loves
by
each
let
this
be
heard
some
do
it
with
a
bitter
look
some
with
a
flattering
word
the
coward
does
it
with
a
kiss
the
brave
man
with
a
sword
some
kill
their
love
when
they
are
young
and
some
when
they
are
old
some
strangle
with
the
hands
of
lust
some
with
the
hands
of
gold
the
kindest
use
a
knife
because
the
dead
so
soon
grow
cold
some
love
too
little
some
too
long
some
sell
and
others
buy
some
do
the
deed
with
many
tears
and
some
without
a
sigh
for
each
man
kills
the
thing
he
loves
yet
each
man
does
not
die
he
does
not
die
a
death
of
shame
on
a
day
of
dark
disgrace
nor
have
a
noose
about
his
neck
nor
a
cloth
upon
his
face
nor
drop
feet
foremost
through
the
floor
into
an
empty
space
he
does
not
sit
with
silent
men
who
watch
him
night
and
day
who
watch
him
when
he
tries
to
weep
and
when
he
tries
to
pray
who
watch
him
lest
himself
should
rob
the
prison
of
its
prey
he
does
not
wake
at
dawn
to
see
dread
figures
throng
his
room
the
shivering
chaplain
robed
in
white
the
sheriff
stern
with
gloom
and
the
governor
all
in
shiny
black
with
the
yellow
face
of
doom
he
does
not
rise
in
piteous
haste
to
put
on
while
some
doctor
gloats
and
notes
each
new
and
pose
fingering
a
watch
whose
little
ticks
are
like
horrible
he
does
not
feel
that
sickening
thirst
that
sands
one
throat
before
the
hangman
with
his
gardener
gloves
comes
through
the
padded
door
and
binds
one
with
three
leathern
thongs
that
the
throat
may
thirst
no
more
he
does
not
bend
his
head
to
hear
the
burial
office
read
nor
while
the
anguish
of
his
soul
tells
him
he
is
not
dead
cross
his
own
coffin
as
he
moves
into
the
hideous
shed
he
does
not
stare
upon
the
air
through
a
little
roof
of
glass
he
does
not
pray
with
lips
of
clay
for
his
agony
to
pass
nor
feel
upon
his
shuddering
cheek
the
kiss
of
caiaphas
ii
six
weeks
the
guardsman
walked
the
yard
in
the
suit
of
shabby
gray
his
cricket
cap
was
on
his
head
and
his
step
was
light
and
gay
but
i
never
saw
a
man
who
looked
so
wistfully
at
the
day
i
never
saw
a
man
who
looked
with
such
a
wistful
eye
upon
that
little
tent
of
blue
which
prisoners
call
the
sky
and
at
every
wandering
cloud
that
trailed
its
ravelled
fleeces
by
he
did
not
wring
his
hands
as
do
those
witless
men
who
dare
to
try
to
rear
the
changeling
hope
in
the
cave
of
black
despair
he
only
looked
upon
the
sun
and
drank
the
morning
air
he
did
not
wring
his
hands
nor
weep
nor
did
he
peek
or
pine
but
he
drank
the
air
as
though
it
held
some
healthful
anodyne
with
open
mouth
he
drank
the
sun
as
though
it
had
been
wine
and
i
and
all
the
souls
in
pain
who
tramped
the
other
ring
forgot
if
we
ourselves
had
done
a
great
or
little
thing
and
watched
with
gaze
of
dull
amaze
the
man
who
had
to
swing
for
strange
it
was
to
see
him
pass
with
a
step
so
light
and
gay
and
strange
it
was
to
see
him
look
so
wistfully
at
the
day
and
strange
it
was
to
think
that
he
had
such
a
debt
to
pay
the
oak
and
elm
have
pleasant
leaves
that
in
the
shoot
but
grim
to
see
is
the
with
its
root
and
green
or
dry
a
man
must
die
before
it
bears
its
fruit
the
loftiest
place
is
the
seat
of
grace
for
which
all
worldlings
try
but
who
would
stand
in
hempen
band
upon
a
scaffold
high
and
through
a
murderer
collar
take
his
last
look
at
the
sky
it
is
sweet
to
dance
to
violins
when
love
and
life
are
fair
to
dance
to
flutes
to
dance
to
lutes
is
delicate
and
rare
but
it
is
not
sweet
with
nimble
feet
to
dance
upon
the
air
so
with
curious
eyes
and
sick
surmise
we
watched
him
day
by
day
and
wondered
if
each
one
of
us
would
end
the
way
for
none
can
tell
to
what
red
hell
his
sightless
soul
may
stray
at
last
the
dead
man
walked
no
more
amongst
the
trial
men
and
i
knew
that
he
was
standing
up
in
the
black
dock
dreadful
pen
and
that
never
would
i
see
his
face
for
weal
or
woe
again
like
two
doomed
ships
that
pass
in
storm
we
had
crossed
each
other
way
but
we
made
no
sign
we
said
no
word
we
had
no
word
to
say
for
we
did
not
meet
in
the
holy
night
but
in
the
shameful
day
a
prison
wall
was
round
us
both
two
outcast
men
we
were
the
world
had
thrust
us
from
its
heart
and
god
from
out
his
care
and
the
iron
gin
that
waits
for
sin
had
caught
us
in
its
snare
iii
in
debtors
yard
the
stones
are
hard
and
the
dripping
wall
is
high
so
it
was
there
he
took
the
air
beneath
the
leaden
sky
and
by
each
side
a
warder
walked
for
fear
the
man
might
die
or
else
he
sat
with
those
who
watched
his
anguish
night
and
day
who
watched
him
when
he
rose
to
weep
and
when
he
crouched
to
pray
who
watched
him
lest
himself
should
rob
their
scaffold
of
its
prey
the
governor
was
strong
upon
the
regulations
act
the
doctor
said
that
death
was
but
a
scientific
fact
and
twice
a
day
the
chaplain
called
and
left
a
little
tract
and
twice
a
day
he
smoked
his
pipe
and
drank
his
quart
of
beer
his
soul
was
resolute
and
held
no
for
fear
he
often
said
that
he
was
glad
the
hangman
day
was
near
but
why
he
said
so
strange
a
thing
no
warder
dared
to
ask
for
he
to
whom
a
watcher
doom
is
given
as
his
task
must
set
a
lock
upon
his
lips
and
make
his
face
a
mask
or
else
he
might
be
moved
and
try
to
comfort
or
console
and
what
should
human
pity
do
pent
up
in
murderers
hole
what
word
of
grace
in
such
a
place
could
help
a
brother
soul
with
slouch
and
swing
around
the
ring
we
trod
the
fools
parade
we
did
not
care
we
knew
we
were
the
devils
own
brigade
and
shaven
head
and
feet
of
lead
make
a
merry
masquerade
we
tore
the
tarry
rope
to
shreds
with
blunt
and
bleeding
nails
we
rubbed
the
doors
and
scrubbed
the
floors
and
cleaned
the
shining
rails
and
rank
by
rank
we
soaped
the
plank
and
clattered
with
the
pails
we
sewed
the
sacks
we
broke
the
stones
we
turned
the
dusty
drill
we
banged
the
tins
and
bawled
the
hymns
and
sweated
on
the
mill
but
in
the
heart
of
every
man
terror
was
lying
still
so
still
it
lay
that
every
day
crawled
like
a
wave
and
we
forgot
the
bitter
lot
that
waits
for
fool
and
knave
till
once
as
we
tramped
in
from
work
we
passed
an
open
grave
with
yawning
mouth
the
horrid
hole
gaped
for
a
living
thing
the
very
mud
cried
out
for
blood
to
the
thirsty
asphalte
ring
and
we
knew
that
ere
one
dawn
grew
fair
the
fellow
had
to
swing
right
in
we
went
with
soul
intent
on
death
and
dread
and
doom
the
hangman
with
his
little
bag
went
shuffling
through
the
gloom
and
i
trembled
as
i
groped
my
way
into
my
numbered
tomb
that
night
the
empty
corridors
were
full
of
forms
of
fear
and
up
and
down
the
iron
town
stole
feet
we
could
not
hear
and
through
the
bars
that
hide
the
stars
white
faces
seemed
to
peer
he
lay
as
one
who
lies
and
dreams
in
a
pleasant
the
watchers
watched
him
as
he
slept
and
could
not
understand
how
one
could
sleep
so
sweet
a
sleep
with
a
hangman
close
at
hand
but
there
is
no
sleep
when
men
must
weep
who
never
yet
have
wept
so
the
fool
the
fraud
the
that
endless
vigil
kept
and
through
each
brain
on
hands
of
pain
another
terror
crept
alas
it
is
a
fearful
thing
to
feel
another
guilt
for
right
within
the
sword
of
sin
pierced
to
its
poisoned
hilt
and
as
molten
lead
were
the
tears
we
shed
for
the
blood
we
had
not
spilt
the
warders
with
their
shoes
of
felt
crept
by
each
padlocked
door
and
peeped
and
saw
with
eyes
of
awe
gray
figures
on
the
floor
and
wondered
why
men
knelt
to
pray
who
never
prayed
before
all
through
the
night
we
knelt
and
prayed
mad
mourners
of
a
corse
the
troubled
plumes
of
midnight
shook
like
the
plumes
upon
a
hearse
and
as
bitter
wine
upon
a
sponge
was
the
savour
of
remorse
the
gray
cock
crew
the
red
cock
crew
but
never
came
the
day
and
crooked
shapes
of
terror
crouched
in
the
corners
where
we
lay
and
each
evil
sprite
that
walks
by
night
before
us
seemed
to
play
they
glided
past
the
glided
fast
like
travellers
through
a
mist
they
mocked
the
moon
in
a
rigadoon
of
delicate
turn
and
twist
and
with
formal
pace
and
loathsome
grace
the
phantoms
kept
their
tryst
with
mop
and
mow
we
saw
them
go
slim
shadows
hand
in
hand
about
about
in
ghostly
rout
they
trod
a
saraband
and
the
damned
grotesques
made
arabesques
like
the
wind
upon
the
sand
with
the
pirouettes
of
marionettes
they
tripped
on
pointed
tread
but
with
flutes
of
fear
they
filled
the
ear
as
their
grisly
masque
they
led
and
loud
they
sang
and
long
they
sang
for
they
sang
to
wake
the
dead
oho
they
cried
the
world
is
wide
but
fettered
limbs
go
lame
and
once
or
twice
to
throw
the
dice
is
a
gentlemanly
game
but
he
does
not
win
who
plays
with
sin
in
the
secret
house
of
shame
no
things
of
air
these
antics
were
that
frolicked
with
such
glee
to
men
whose
lives
were
held
in
gyves
and
whose
feet
might
not
go
free
ah
wounds
of
christ
they
were
living
things
most
terrible
to
see
around
around
they
waltzed
and
wound
some
wheeled
in
smirking
pairs
with
the
mincing
step
of
a
demirep
some
sidled
up
the
stairs
and
with
subtle
sneer
and
fawning
leer
each
helped
us
at
our
prayers
the
morning
wind
began
to
moan
but
still
the
night
went
on
through
its
giant
loom
the
web
of
gloom
crept
till
each
thread
was
spun
and
as
we
prayed
we
grew
afraid
of
the
justice
of
the
sun
the
moaning
wind
went
wandering
round
the
weeping
prison
wall
till
like
a
wheel
of
turning
steel
we
felt
the
minutes
crawl
o
moaning
wind
what
had
we
done
to
have
such
a
seneschal
at
last
i
saw
the
shadowed
bars
like
a
lattice
wrought
in
lead
move
right
across
the
whitewashed
wall
that
faced
my
bed
and
i
knew
that
somewhere
in
the
world
god
dreadful
dawn
was
red
at
six
we
cleaned
our
cells
at
seven
all
was
still
but
the
sough
and
swing
of
a
mighty
wing
the
prison
seemed
to
fill
for
the
lord
of
death
with
icy
breath
had
entered
in
to
kill
he
did
not
pass
in
purple
pomp
nor
ride
a
steed
three
yards
of
cord
and
a
sliding
board
are
all
the
gallows
need
so
with
rope
of
shame
the
herald
came
to
do
the
secret
deed
we
were
as
men
who
through
a
fen
of
filthy
darkness
grope
we
did
not
dare
to
breathe
a
prayer
or
to
give
our
anguish
scope
something
was
dead
in
each
of
us
and
what
was
dead
was
hope
for
man
grim
justice
goes
its
way
and
will
not
swerve
aside
it
slays
the
weak
it
slays
the
strong
it
has
a
deadly
stride
with
iron
heel
it
slays
the
strong
the
monstrous
parricide
we
waited
for
the
stroke
of
eight
each
tongue
was
thick
with
thirst
for
the
stroke
of
eight
is
the
stroke
of
fate
that
makes
a
man
accursed
and
fate
will
use
a
running
noose
for
the
best
man
and
the
worst
we
had
no
other
thing
to
do
save
to
wait
for
the
sign
to
come
so
like
things
of
stone
in
a
valley
lone
quiet
we
sat
and
dumb
but
each
man
heart
beat
thick
and
quick
like
a
madman
on
a
drum
with
sudden
shock
the
smote
on
the
shivering
air
and
from
all
the
gaol
rose
up
a
wail
of
impotent
despair
like
the
sound
the
frightened
marshes
hear
from
some
leper
in
his
lair
and
as
one
sees
most
fearful
things
in
the
crystal
of
a
dream
we
saw
the
greasy
hempen
rope
hooked
to
the
blackened
beam
and
heard
the
prayer
the
hangman
snare
strangled
into
a
scream
and
all
the
woe
that
moved
him
so
that
he
gave
that
bitter
cry
and
the
wild
regrets
and
the
bloody
sweats
none
knew
so
well
as
i
for
he
who
lives
more
lives
than
one
more
deaths
that
one
must
die
iv
there
is
no
chapel
on
the
day
on
which
they
hang
a
man
the
chaplain
heart
is
far
too
sick
or
his
face
is
far
too
wan
or
there
is
that
written
in
his
eyes
which
none
should
look
upon
so
they
kept
us
close
till
nigh
on
noon
and
then
they
rang
the
bell
and
the
warders
with
their
jingling
keys
opened
each
listening
cell
and
down
the
iron
stair
we
tramped
each
from
his
separate
hell
out
into
god
sweet
air
we
went
but
not
in
wonted
way
for
this
man
face
was
white
with
fear
and
that
man
face
was
gray
and
i
never
saw
sad
men
who
looked
so
wistfully
at
the
day
i
never
saw
sad
men
who
looked
with
such
a
wistful
eye
upon
that
little
tent
of
blue
we
prisoners
called
the
sky
and
at
every
happy
cloud
that
passed
in
such
strange
freedom
by
but
there
were
those
amongst
us
all
who
walked
with
downcast
head
and
knew
that
had
each
got
his
due
they
should
have
died
instead
he
had
but
killed
a
thing
that
lived
whilst
they
had
killed
the
dead
for
he
who
sins
a
second
time
wakes
a
dead
soul
to
pain
and
draws
it
from
its
spotted
shroud
and
makes
it
bleed
again
and
makes
it
bleed
great
gouts
of
blood
and
makes
it
bleed
in
vain
like
ape
or
clown
in
monstrous
garb
with
crooked
arrows
starred
silently
we
went
round
and
round
the
slippery
asphalte
yard
silently
we
went
round
and
round
and
no
man
spoke
a
word
silently
we
went
round
and
round
and
through
each
hollow
mind
the
memory
of
dreadful
things
rushed
like
a
dreadful
wind
and
horror
stalked
before
each
man
and
terror
crept
behind
the
warders
strutted
up
and
down
and
watched
their
herd
of
brutes
their
uniforms
were
spick
and
span
and
they
wore
their
sunday
suits
but
we
knew
the
work
they
had
been
at
by
the
quicklime
on
their
boots
for
where
a
grave
had
opened
wide
there
was
no
grave
at
all
only
a
stretch
of
mud
and
sand
by
the
hideous
and
a
little
heap
of
burning
lime
that
the
man
should
have
his
pall
for
he
has
a
pall
this
wretched
man
such
as
few
men
can
claim
deep
down
below
a
naked
for
greater
shame
he
lies
with
fetters
on
each
foot
wrapt
in
a
sheet
of
flame
and
all
the
while
the
burning
lime
eats
flesh
and
bone
away
it
eats
the
brittle
bones
by
night
and
the
soft
flesh
by
day
it
eats
the
flesh
and
bone
by
turns
but
it
eats
the
heart
alway
for
three
long
years
they
will
not
sow
or
root
or
seedling
there
for
three
long
years
the
unblessed
spot
will
sterile
be
and
bare
and
look
upon
the
wondering
sky
with
unreproachful
stare
they
think
a
murderer
heart
would
taint
each
simple
seed
they
sow
it
is
not
true
god
kindly
earth
is
kindlier
than
men
know
and
the
red
rose
would
but
glow
more
red
the
white
rose
whiter
blow
out
of
his
mouth
a
red
red
rose
out
of
his
heart
a
white
for
who
can
say
by
what
strange
way
christ
brings
his
will
to
light
since
the
barren
staff
the
pilgrim
bore
bloomed
in
the
great
pope
sight
but
neither
rose
nor
red
may
bloom
in
prison
air
the
shard
the
pebble
and
the
flint
are
what
they
give
us
there
for
flowers
have
been
known
to
heal
a
common
man
despair
so
never
will
rose
or
white
petal
by
petal
fall
on
that
stretch
of
mud
and
sand
that
lies
by
the
hideous
to
tell
the
men
who
tramp
the
yard
that
god
son
died
for
all
yet
though
the
hideous
still
hems
him
round
and
round
and
a
spirit
may
not
walk
by
night
that
is
with
fetters
bound
and
a
spirit
may
but
weep
that
lies
in
such
unholy
ground
he
is
at
this
wretched
at
peace
or
will
be
soon
there
is
no
thing
to
make
him
mad
nor
does
terror
walk
at
noon
for
the
lampless
earth
in
which
he
lies
has
neither
sun
nor
moon
they
hanged
him
as
a
beast
is
hanged
they
did
not
even
toll
a
requiem
that
might
have
brought
rest
to
his
startled
soul
but
hurriedly
they
took
him
out
and
hid
him
in
a
hole
the
warders
stripped
him
of
his
clothes
and
gave
him
to
the
flies
they
mocked
the
swollen
purple
throat
and
the
stark
and
staring
eyes
and
with
laughter
loud
they
heaped
the
shroud
in
which
the
convict
lies
the
chaplain
would
not
kneel
to
pray
by
his
dishonoured
grave
nor
mark
it
with
that
blessed
cross
that
christ
for
sinners
gave
because
the
man
was
one
of
those
whom
christ
came
down
to
save
yet
all
is
well
he
has
but
passed
to
life
appointed
bourne
and
alien
tears
will
fill
for
him
pity
urn
for
his
mourners
be
outcast
men
and
outcasts
always
mourn
v
i
know
not
whether
laws
be
right
or
whether
laws
be
wrong
all
that
we
know
who
lie
in
gaol
is
that
the
wall
is
strong
and
that
each
day
is
like
a
year
a
year
whose
days
are
long
but
this
i
know
that
every
law
that
men
have
made
for
man
since
first
man
took
his
brother
life
and
the
sad
world
began
but
straws
the
wheat
and
saves
the
chaff
with
a
most
evil
fan
this
too
i
and
wise
it
were
if
each
could
know
the
that
every
prison
that
men
build
is
built
with
bricks
of
shame
and
bound
with
bars
lest
christ
should
see
how
men
their
brothers
maim
with
bars
they
blur
the
gracious
moon
and
blind
the
goodly
sun
and
they
do
well
to
hide
their
hell
for
in
it
things
are
done
that
son
of
god
nor
son
of
man
ever
should
look
upon
the
vilest
deeds
like
poison
weeds
bloom
well
in
it
is
only
what
is
good
in
man
that
wastes
and
withers
there
pale
anguish
keeps
the
heavy
gate
and
the
warder
is
despair
for
they
starve
the
little
frightened
child
till
it
weeps
both
night
and
day
and
they
scourge
the
weak
and
flog
the
fool
and
gibe
the
old
and
gray
and
some
grow
mad
and
all
grow
bad
and
none
a
word
may
say
each
narrow
cell
in
which
we
dwell
is
a
foul
and
dark
latrine
and
the
fetid
breath
of
living
death
chokes
up
each
grated
screen
and
all
but
lust
is
turned
to
dust
in
humanity
machine
the
brackish
water
that
we
drink
creeps
with
a
loathsome
slime
and
the
bitter
bread
they
weigh
in
scales
is
full
of
chalk
and
lime
and
sleep
will
not
lie
down
but
walks
and
cries
to
time
but
though
lean
hunger
and
green
thirst
like
asp
with
adder
fight
we
have
little
care
of
prison
fare
for
what
chills
and
kills
outright
is
that
every
stone
one
lifts
by
day
becomes
one
heart
by
night
with
midnight
always
in
one
heart
and
twilight
in
one
cell
we
turn
the
crank
or
tear
the
rope
each
in
his
separate
hell
and
the
silence
is
more
awful
far
than
the
sound
of
a
brazen
bell
and
never
a
human
voice
comes
near
to
speak
a
gentle
word
and
the
eye
that
watches
through
the
door
is
pitiless
and
hard
and
by
all
forgot
we
rot
and
rot
with
soul
and
body
marred
and
thus
we
rust
life
iron
chain
degraded
and
alone
and
some
men
curse
and
some
men
weep
and
some
men
make
no
moan
but
god
eternal
laws
are
kind
and
break
the
heart
of
stone
and
every
human
heart
that
breaks
in
or
yard
is
as
that
broken
box
that
gave
its
treasure
to
the
lord
and
filled
the
unclean
leper
house
with
the
scent
of
costliest
nard
ah
happy
they
whose
hearts
can
break
and
peace
of
pardon
win
how
else
may
man
make
straight
his
plan
and
cleanse
his
soul
from
sin
how
else
but
through
a
broken
heart
may
lord
christ
enter
in
and
he
of
the
swollen
purple
throat
and
the
stark
and
staring
eyes
waits
for
the
holy
hands
that
took
the
thief
to
paradise
and
a
broken
and
a
contrite
heart
the
lord
will
not
despise
the
man
in
red
who
reads
the
law
gave
him
three
weeks
of
life
three
little
weeks
in
which
to
heal
his
soul
of
his
soul
strife
and
cleanse
from
every
blot
of
blood
the
hand
that
held
the
knife
and
with
tears
of
blood
he
cleansed
the
hand
the
hand
that
held
the
steel
for
only
blood
can
wipe
out
blood
and
only
tears
can
heal
and
the
crimson
stain
that
was
of
cain
became
christ
seal
vi
in
reading
gaol
by
reading
town
there
is
a
pit
of
shame
and
in
it
lies
a
wretched
man
eaten
by
teeth
of
flame
in
a
burning
he
lies
and
his
grave
has
got
no
name
and
there
till
christ
call
forth
the
dead
in
silence
let
him
lie
no
need
to
waste
the
foolish
tear
or
heave
the
windy
sigh
the
man
had
killed
the
thing
he
loved
and
so
he
had
to
die
and
all
men
kill
the
thing
they
love
by
all
let
this
be
heard
some
do
it
with
a
bitter
look
some
with
a
flattering
word
the
coward
does
it
with
a
kiss
the
brave
man
with
a
sword
the
end
