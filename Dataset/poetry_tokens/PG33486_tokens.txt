a

unbroken
smitten
who
knows
how
one
sitteth
silent
only
in
his
usual
seat
we
gave
him
once
that
freedom
why
not
now
perhaps
he
is
too
weary
and
needs
rest
he
needed
it
too
often
nor
could
we
bestow
god
gave
it
knowing
how
to
do
so
best
which
of
us
would
disturb
him
let
him
be
there
is
no
vacant
chair
if
he
will
take
the
mood
to
listen
mutely
be
it
done
by
his
least
mood
we
crossed
for
which
the
heart
must
ache
plead
not
nor
question
let
him
have
this
one
death
is
a
mood
of
life
it
is
no
whim
by
which
life
giver
mocks
a
broken
heart
death
is
life
reticence
still
audible
to
him
the
hushed
voice
happy
speaketh
on
apart
there
is
no
vacant
chair
to
love
is
still
to
have
nearer
to
memory
than
to
eye
and
dearer
yet
to
anguish
than
to
comfort
will
we
hold
him
by
our
love
that
shall
not
die
for
while
it
doth
not
thus
he
can
not
try
who
can
put
out
the
motion
or
the
smile
the
old
ways
of
being
noble
all
with
him
laid
by
because
we
love
he
is
then
trust
awhile
released
oh
joy
of
the
dying
at
last
thou
art
mine
and
leaping
to
meet
thee
impatient
to
greet
thee
a
rapid
and
rapturous
sensitive
fine
gayety
steals
through
my
pulses
daring
and
doubting
like
pleasure
forbidden
or
winter
looking
at
may
oh
sorrow
of
living
make
way
for
the
thrill
of
the
soul
that
is
starting
onlooking
departing
across
the
threshold
of
clay
bend
bow
to
the
will
of
the
soul
that
is
up
and
away
the
room
width
i
think
if
i
should
cross
the
room
far
as
fear
should
stand
beside
you
like
a
thought
touch
you
dear
like
a
fancy
to
your
sad
heart
it
would
seem
that
my
vision
passed
and
prayed
you
or
my
dream
then
you
would
look
with
lonely
eyes
lift
your
head
and
you
would
stir
and
sigh
and
say
she
is
dead
baffled
by
death
and
love
i
lean
through
the
gloom
o
lord
of
life
am
i
forbid
to
cross
the
room
the
first
christmas
apart
the
shadows
watch
about
the
house
silent
as
they
i
come
oh
it
is
true
that
life
is
deaf
and
not
that
death
is
dumb
the
christmas
thrill
is
on
the
earth
the
stars
throb
in
the
sky
love
listens
in
a
thousand
homes
the
christmas
bells
ring
by
i
cross
the
old
familiar
door
and
take
the
dear
old
chair
you
look
with
desolated
eyes
upon
me
sitting
there
you
gaze
and
see
not
though
the
tears
in
gazing
burn
and
start
believe
the
living
are
the
blind
not
that
the
dead
depart
a
year
ago
some
words
we
said
kept
sacred
us
twain
is
you
poor
love
who
answer
not
the
while
i
speak
again
i
lean
above
you
as
before
faithful
my
arms
enfold
oh
could
you
know
that
life
is
numb
nor
think
that
death
is
cold
senses
of
earth
how
weak
ye
are
joys
joys
of
heaven
how
strong
loves
of
the
earth
how
short
and
sad
of
heaven
how
glad
and
long
heart
of
my
heart
if
earth
or
heaven
had
speech
or
language
fine
enough
or
death
or
life
could
give
me
symbol
sound
or
sign
to
reach
you
thought
or
touch
or
eye
body
or
soul
i
die
again
to
make
you
understand
this
is
the
angel
joy
oh
was
it
a
not
dreamed
through
that
eyed
her
like
a
foe
or
only
a
sorrow
left
over
from
life
years
ago
how
long
was
it
since
she
died
who
told
or
yet
what
was
death
who
knew
she
said
i
am
come
to
heaven
at
last
and
i
do
as
the
blessed
do
but
the
custom
of
earth
was
stronger
than
heaven
and
the
habit
of
life
than
death
how
should
an
anguish
as
old
as
thought
be
healed
by
the
end
of
breath
tissue
and
nerve
and
pulse
of
her
soul
had
absorbed
the
disease
of
woe
the
strangest
of
all
the
angels
there
was
joy
oh
the
wretched
know
i
am
too
tired
with
earth
she
said
to
rest
me
in
paradise
give
me
a
spot
to
creep
away
and
close
my
heavy
eyes
i
must
learn
to
be
happy
in
heaven
she
said
as
we
learned
to
suffer
below
our
ways
are
not
your
ways
he
said
and
ours
the
ways
you
go
as
love
too
wise
for
a
word
puts
by
all
a
woman
weak
alarms
joy
hushed
her
lips
and
gathered
her
into
his
mighty
arms
he
took
her
to
his
holy
heart
and
there
for
he
held
her
fast
the
saddest
spirit
in
the
world
came
to
herself
at
last
absent
you
do
not
lift
your
eyes
to
watch
us
pass
the
conscious
door
your
startled
ear
perceiveth
not
our
footfall
on
the
floor
no
eager
word
your
lips
betray
to
greet
us
when
we
stand
we
throng
to
meet
you
but
you
hold
to
us
no
beckoning
hand
faint
as
the
years
in
which
we
breathed
far
as
the
death
we
died
dim
as
the
faded
we
wander
at
your
side
cold
as
a
cause
outlived
or
lost
vague
as
the
legends
told
at
twilight
of
a
mystic
band
circling
an
age
of
gold
unseen
unheard
unfelt
and
yet
beneath
the
army
blue
our
sounded
real
enough
when
we
were
boys
like
you
we
turned
us
from
your
fabled
lore
with
ancient
passion
rife
no
myth
our
solemn
laying
down
of
love
and
hope
and
life
no
myth
the
clasped
and
severed
hands
no
dream
the
last
replies
upon
the
desolated
home
the
sunlight
lies
take
sons
of
peace
your
heritage
our
loss
your
legacy
our
action
be
your
fables
fair
our
facts
your
poetry
o
ye
who
fall
on
calmer
times
the
perils
of
the
calm
are
yours
the
swell
the
sloth
the
sleep
the
carelessness
of
harm
the
keel
that
rides
the
gale
to
strike
where
the
warm
waves
are
still
ours
were
the
surf
the
stir
the
shock
the
tempest
and
the
thrill
comrades
be
yours
that
vigor
old
be
yours
the
elected
power
that
fits
a
man
like
rock
to
tide
to
his
appointed
hour
yours
to
become
all
that
we
were
and
all
we
might
have
been
yours
the
fine
eye
that
separates
the
unseen
from
the
seen
written
for
the
centennial
celebration
at
andover
phillips
academy
the
unseen
comrades
last
night
i
saw
an
armèd
band
whose
feet
did
take
the
martial
step
although
they
trod
soundless
as
waves
of
light
upon
the
air
silent
from
silent
lips
the
bugle
fell
the
wind
was
wild
but
the
great
flag
they
bore
hung
motionless
and
glittered
like
a
god
above
their
awful
faces
while
they
marched
and
when
i
saw
i
understood
and
said
if
these
are
they
whom
we
did
love
and
give
what
seek
they
but
one
sternly
answered
me
we
seek
our
comrades
whom
we
left
to
thee
the
weak
who
were
thy
strength
the
poor
who
had
thy
pride
the
faint
and
few
who
gave
to
thee
one
supreme
hour
from
out
the
day
of
life
one
deed
majestic
to
their
century
these
were
thy
trust
how
fare
they
at
thy
hands
thy
saviors
then
are
they
thy
heroes
now
our
comrades
still
we
keep
the
step
with
them
as
thou
unto
the
least
of
them
shalt
do
so
dost
thou
unto
us
written
for
the
benefit
of
the
soldiers
home
at
chelsea
massachusetts
stronger
than
death
who
shall
tell
the
story
as
it
was
write
it
with
the
heart
blood
pale
ink
alas
speak
it
with
the
soul
lips
or
be
dumb
tell
me
singers
fled
and
song
to
come
no
answer
like
a
shell
the
silence
curls
and
far
within
it
leans
a
whisper
out
breathless
and
inarticulate
and
whirls
and
dies
as
dies
an
ailing
dread
or
doubt
and
i
since
there
is
found
none
else
than
i
no
stronger
sweeter
voice
than
mine
to
tell
this
tale
of
love
that
can
not
stoop
to
die
were
fain
to
be
the
whisper
in
the
shell
were
fain
to
lose
and
spend
myself
within
the
sacred
silence
of
one
mighty
heart
and
leaning
from
it
hidden
there
to
win
some
finer
ear
that
listening
bends
apart
fly
for
your
lives
the
entrails
of
the
earth
trembled
resounding
to
the
cry
that
like
a
chasing
ghost
around
the
mine
crept
ghastly
the
pit
on
fire
fly
the
shaft
a
poisoned
throat
whose
breath
was
death
like
hell
itself
grown
sick
of
sin
hurled
up
the
men
haggard
and
terrible
leaping
upon
us
through
the
din
that
all
our
voices
made
and
back
we
shrank
from
them
as
from
the
starting
dead
recoiling
shrieked
but
knew
not
why
we
shrieked
and
cried
but
knew
not
what
we
said
and
still
that
awful
mouth
did
toss
them
up
the
last
is
safe
the
last
is
sound
we
sobbed
to
see
them
where
they
sunk
and
crawled
like
beaten
hounds
upon
the
ground
some
sat
with
lolling
idiot
head
and
laughed
one
reached
to
clutch
the
air
away
his
gasping
lips
refused
some
cursed
and
one
knelt
down
but
he
was
old
to
pray
we
huddled
there
together
all
that
night
women
and
men
from
the
wild
town
i
heard
a
shrill
voice
cry
we
all
are
up
but
some
ye
have
forgot
are
down
who
is
forgot
we
stared
from
face
to
face
but
answering
through
the
dark
she
said
it
was
a
woman
eh
ye
need
not
fret
none
is
forgot
except
the
dead
the
buried
dead
asleep
there
in
the
works
eh
lord
it
must
be
hot
below
ye
keep
waking
all
the
livelong
night
to
set
the
mine
so
and
all
the
night
the
mine
did
burn
and
burst
as
if
the
earth
were
but
a
shell
through
which
a
child
had
thrust
a
and
peal
on
dreadful
peal
the
bell
the
miner
wrenched
the
quaking
air
and
through
the
flaring
light
we
saw
the
solid
forehead
of
the
eternal
hill
take
on
a
human
look
of
awe
as
if
it
were
a
living
thing
that
spoke
and
flung
some
protest
to
the
sky
as
if
it
were
a
dying
thing
that
saw
but
could
not
tell
a
mystery
the
bells
ran
ringing
by
us
all
that
night
the
bells
ceased
jangling
with
the
morn
about
the
blackened
works
sunk
tossed
and
rent
we
gathered
in
the
foreign
dawn
women
and
men
with
eyes
askance
and
strange
fearing
we
knew
not
what
to
see
against
the
hollowed
jaws
of
the
torn
hill
why
creep
the
miners
silently
from
man
to
man
a
whisper
chills
see
see
the
sunken
shaft
of
the
earth
a
traitor
to
her
trust
has
fled
and
turned
the
dead
unto
the
sun
and
here
o
god
of
life
and
death
thy
work
thine
only
this
with
foreheads
bare
we
knelt
and
drew
him
young
and
beautiful
thirty
years
dead
into
the
air
thus
had
he
perished
buried
from
the
day
by
the
swift
poison
caught
and
slain
by
the
kind
poison
unmarred
rendered
fair
back
to
the
upper
earth
again
the
warm
and
breathing
earth
that
knew
him
not
and
men
and
women
wept
to
see
for
kindred
had
he
none
among
us
all
how
lonely
even
the
dead
may
be
we
wept
i
say
we
wept
who
knew
him
not
but
sharp
a
tearless
woman
sprang
from
out
the
crowd
that
quavering
voice
i
knew
and
terrible
her
cry
outrang
i
pass
i
pass
ye
all
make
way
stand
back
mine
is
the
place
ye
yield
she
said
he
was
my
lover
once
my
own
my
own
oh
he
was
mine
and
he
is
dead
women
and
men
we
gave
her
royal
way
proud
as
young
joy
the
smile
she
had
we
knew
her
for
a
neighbor
in
the
town
unmated
solitary
sad
youth
hope
and
love
we
gave
her
silent
way
calm
as
a
sigh
she
swept
us
all
then
swiftly
as
a
word
leans
to
a
thought
we
saw
her
lean
to
him
and
fall
upon
the
happy
body
of
the
dead
an
aged
woman
poor
and
gray
bright
as
the
day
immortal
as
young
love
and
glorious
as
life
he
lay
her
shrunken
hands
caressed
his
rounded
cheek
her
white
locks
on
his
golden
hair
fell
sadly
o
love
she
cried
with
shriveled
lips
o
love
my
love
my
own
my
fair
see
i
am
old
and
all
my
heart
is
gray
they
say
the
dead
are
aye
forgot
there
there
my
sweet
i
whisper
leaning
low
that
all
these
women
hear
it
not
deep
in
the
darkness
there
didst
think
on
me
high
in
the
heavens
have
ye
been
true
since
i
was
young
and
since
you
called
me
fair
i
never
loved
a
man
but
you
and
here
my
boy
you
lie
so
safe
so
still
but
there
she
hushed
and
in
the
dim
cool
morning
timid
as
a
bride
but
calm
as
a
glad
mother
gathered
him
unto
her
heart
and
all
the
people
then
women
and
men
and
children
too
crept
back
and
back
and
back
and
on
still
as
the
morning
shadows
do
and
left
them
in
the
lifting
dawn
they
two
on
her
sad
breast
his
shining
head
stirred
softly
as
were
he
the
living
one
and
she
had
been
the
moveless
dead
and
yet
we
crept
on
back
and
back
and
on
the
distance
widened
like
the
sky
between
our
little
restlessness
and
love
so
godlike
that
it
could
not
die
ii
vittoria
wise
was
the
word
the
wise
man
spake
who
said
angelo
was
the
only
man
to
whom
god
gave
four
souls
the
soul
of
sculpture
and
of
song
of
architecture
and
of
art
these
all
for
so
god
loved
him
as
if
he
were
his
only
child
and
grouped
about
those
brows
ideals
of
himself
not
angels
mild
as
those
that
flit
and
beckon
other
lives
but
cherubim
and
seraphim
tall
strong
unsleeping
terrible
with
wings
across
their
mighty
feet
and
eyes
if
we
would
look
upon
their
blazing
eyes
these
too
are
hid
some
angels
are
all
wings
oh
shine
and
fly
were
ye
not
angels
ye
would
strike
us
blind
and
yet
they
did
not
could
not
dazzle
her
that
one
sweet
woman
unto
whom
he
bent
as
pliant
as
the
quarried
marble
turned
to
life
immortal
in
his

on

she
lifted
lonely
eyes
the
years
trod
slow
fourfold
the
reverence
which
he
gave
to
her
fourfold
the
awful
tenderness
fourfold
the
loyalty
the
trust
and
oh
fourfold
the
comfort

of
comforting
whereby
a

one
soul
a
little
one
and
it
was
stained
and
he
it
too
perhaps
god

dead
the
dead
are

the

angelo
was
too
late
and
one
who
dared
to
shed
a
tear
for
him
has
dropped
it
here
new
neighbors
within
the
window
scant
recess
behind
a
pink
geranium
flower
she
sits
and
sews
and
sews
and
sits
from
patient
hour
to
patient
hour
as
as
marble
is
or
as
a
lovely
death
might
be
a
marble
death
condemned
to
make
a
feint
at
life
perpetually
wondering
i
watch
to
pity
her
wandering
i
go
my
restless
ways
content
i
think
the
untamed
thoughts
of
free
and
solitary
days
until
the
mournful
dusk
begins
to
drop
upon
the
quiet
street
until
upon
the
pavement
far
there
falls
the
sound
of
coming
feet
a
happy
hastening
ardent
sound
tender
as
kisses
on
the
air
quick
as
if
touched
by
unseen
lips
blushes
the
little
statue
there
and
as
young
life
is
and
as
joy
may
be
tender
with
color
lithe
with
love
she
starts
transfigured
gloriously
superb
in
one
transcendent
glance
her
eyes
i
see
are
burning
black
my
little
neighbor
smiling
turns
and
throws
my
unasked
pity
back
i
wonder
is
it
worth
the
while
to
sit
and
sew
from
hour
to
hour
to
sit
and
sew
with
eyes
of
black
behind
a
pink
geranium
flower
by
the
hearth
you
come
too
late
is
far
on
in
november
the
wind
strikes
bleak
upon
the
cheek
that
careth
rather
to
keep
warm
and
where
the
harm
than
to
abate
one
jot
of
its
calm
color
for
your
sake
watch
see
i
stir
the
ember
upon
my
lonely
hearth
and
bid
the
fire
wake
and
think
you
that
it
will
is
burned
i
say
to
ashes
it
smoulders
cold
as
mould
i
wish
indeed
you
would
not
blow
upon
it
so
the
dead
to
kill
i
say
the
ghosts
of
fires
will
never
stir
nor
woman
lift
the
lashes
of
eyes
wept
dim
yours
shine
for
love
of
her
ah
sweet
surprise
did
not
think
such
shining
upon
the
gloom
of
this
cold
room
could
fall
your
even
strong
calm
breath
calls
life
from
death
the
warm
light
lies
at
your
triumphant
feet
faint
with
desire
to
reach
you
see
the
lining
of
violet
and
of
silver
in
that
sheath
of
fire
if
you
would
care
although
it
is
november
i
will
not
say
a
bitter
nay
to
such
a
gift
for
building
fires
and
though
it
tires
me
to
think
of
it
i
own
to
you
if
you
can
stir
the
ember
it
may
be
found
at
last
just
warm
enough
for
two
told
in
confidence
vow
you
never
never
tell
him
freezing
stars
now
glittering
farthest
fairest
on
the
winter
sky
if
he
woo
me
not
your
coldest
cruel
ray
or
can
or
may
be
found
more
chill
and
still
to
him
than
i
swear
you
never
never
tell
him
warm
red
roses
lifting
your
shy
faces
to
the
summer
dew
if
he
win
me
blush
your
sweetest
in
his
sight
for
his
delight
but
i
can
be
as
warm
and
sweet
as
you
what
the
violins
said
song
we
all
for
love
the
violins
sidney
lanier
do
i
love
you
do
i
love
you
ask
the
heavens
that
bend
above
you
to
find
language
and
to
prove
you
if
they
love
the
living
sun
ask
the
burning
blinded
meadows
if
they
love
the
falling
shadows
if
they
hold
the
happy
shadows
when
the
fervid
day
is
done
ask
the
and
the
daisies
lost
amid
the
hot
lifting
up
their
thirsty
faces
if
they
love
the
summer
rains
ask
the
linnets
and
the
plovers
in
the
made
for
lovers
ask
the
bees
and
ask
the
clovers
will
they
tell
you
for
your
pains
do
i
darling
do
i
love
you
what
i
pray
can
that
behoove
you
how
in
love
name
can
i
move
you
when
for
love
sake
i
am
dumb
if
i
told
you
if
i
told
you
would
that
keep
you
would
that
hold
you
here
at
last
where
i
enfold
you
if
it
would
hush
darling
come
won
oh
when
i
would
have
loved
you
dear
the
sun
of
winter
hung
more
near
yet
not
so
sweet
so
sweet
so
sweet
the
reddening
at
my
feet
your
lips
had
learned
a
golden
word
you
sang
a
song
that
all
men
heard
oh
love
is
fleet
the
strain
is
long
who
stays
the
singer
from
her
song
across
my
path
the
red
leaves
whirled
dared
i
to
kneel
with
all
the
world
how
came
i
then
to
clasp
you
sweet
and
find
a
woman
at
my
feet
spent
heart
of
iron
smile
of
ice
oh
the
rock
see
him
stand
as
dumb
as
death
if
you
could
would
you
care
to
stir
or
shock
him
think
you
by
a
blow
or
breath
from
his
mood
arms
of
velvet
lips
of
love
oh
the
wave
see
her
creeping
to
his
feet
trustfully
none
shall
know
the
sign
he
gave
death
since
then
were
all
too
sweet
let
her
die
lift
thine
eyes
upon
the
sea
soul
of
stone
rather
wouldst
thou
breathe
or
move
i
would
be
a
warm
wave
faithful
wasted
thrown
spent
and
rent
and
dead
with
love
than
be
thee
parted
oh
never
a
word
he
answered
and
never
a
word
spake
she
they
turned
their
faces
each
from
each
and
looked
upon
the
sea
the
hands
that
can
not
clasp
for
life
must
quickly
severed
be
the
love
that
is
not
large
enough
to
live
eternally
in
true
love
name
for
fair
love
fame
must
die
before
its
bloom
for
it
in
all
god
earth
or
heaven
there
is
no
though
all
the
wine
of
life
be
lost
try
well
the
red
grape
hue
holy
the
soul
that
can
not
taste
the
false
love
for
the
true
and
blessed
aye
the
fainting
heart
for
such
a
thirst
shall
be
yet
never
a
word
they
spoke
and
looked
upon
the
bitter
sea
an
april
gust
it
shall
be
as
it
hath
been
all
the
world
is
glad
and
green
hush
ah
hush
there
can
not
be
april
now
for
you
and
me
put
your
finger
on
the
lips
of
your
soul
the
wild
rain
drips
the
wind
goes
diving
down
the
sea
tell
the
wind
but
tell
not
me
yet
if
i
had
aught
to
tell
high
as
heaven
or
deep
as
hell
bent
the
fates
awry
or
fit
i
would
find
a
word
for
it
oh
words
that
neither
sea
nor
land
can
lift
their
ears
to
understand
wild
words
as
dumb
as
death
or
fear
i
dare
to
die
but
not
to
hear
the
answer
that
we
together
may
sail
just
as
we
used
to
do
carleton
ballads
and
what
if
i
should
be
kind
and
what
if
you
should
be
true
the
old
love
could
never
go
on
just
as
it
used
to
do
the
wan
white
hands
of
the
waves
that
smote
us
swift
apart
will
never
enclasp
again
and
draw
us
heart
to
heart
the
cold
far
feet
of
the
tides
that
trod
between
us
two
can
never
retrace
their
steps
and
fall
where
they
used
to
do
oh
well
the
ships
must
remember
that
go
down
to
the
awful
sea
no
keel
that
chisels
the
current
can
cut
where
it
used
to
be
not
a
throb
of
the
gloom
or
the
glory
that
stirs
in
the
sun
or
the
rain
will
ever
be
gloom
or
glory
that
dazzled
or
darkened
again
not
a
wave
that
stretches
its
arms
and
yearns
to
the
breast
of
the
shore
is
ever
the
wave
that
came
trusting
and
yearning
and
loving
before
the
hope
that
is
high
as
the
heavens
the
joy
that
is
keen
as
pain
the
faith
that
is
free
as
the
morning
can
die
but
can
live
not
again
and
though
i
should
step
beside
you
and
hand
should
reach
unto
hand
we
should
walk
mutely
stifled
ghosts
in
a
breathless
land
and
what
if
i
should
be
kind
and
though
you
should
be
true
the
old
love
could
never
never
love
on
as
it
used
to
do
thorns
as
we
pass
by
the
roses
into
your
bruise
you
the
thorn
quick
at
the
prick
you
start
crying
alas
the
smart
farewell
my
pleasant
friend
wisely
our
way
we
wend
out
of
the
reach
of
roses
oh
we
pass
by
the
roses
where
does
the
red
drop
drip
where
is
the
thorn
what
though
is
hid
and
pressed
piercing
into
my
breast
scathless
i
stretch
my
hand
strong
as
their
roots
i
stand
and
dare
to
trust
the
roses
the
indian
girl
a
picture
by
walter
shirlaw
she
standeth
silent
as
a
thought
too
sacred
to
be
uttered
all
her
face
unfurling
like
a
flower
that
at
a
breath
too
near
will
shut
her
life
a
little
golden
clock
whose
shining
hands
arrested
stay
forever
at
the
hour
of
love
she
doubts
she
dares
she
dreams
of
what
i
ask
she
shrinking
answers
not
she
swims
before
me
dim
a
cup
of
waste
untasted
tenderness
i
drink
i
dread
until
i
seem
myself
unto
myself
to
be
he
whom
she
chose
and
charmed
and
missed
on
some
faint
asiatic
day
of
languorous
summer
ages
since
sealed
shall
i
pour
you
the
wine
she
said
the
wine
that
is
rare
and
red
sweeter
the
cup
for
the
drop
but
why
do
you
shrink
and
stop
the
seal
of
the
wine
has
a
sacred
sign
i
am
afraid
she
said
i
love
and
revere
you
more
for
your
fear
than
i
do
for
your
wine
he
said
guinevere
of
guinevere
from
arthur
separate
and
separate
from
launcelot
and
the
world
and
shielded
in
the
convent
with
her
sin
as
one
draws
fast
a
veil
upon
a
face
that
marred
but
only
holds
the
scar
more
close
against
the
burning
brain
i
read
this
legend
and
if
other
yet
than
i
have
read
or
said
how
know
i
for
the
text
was
written
in
the
story
we
have
learned
between
the
ashen
lines
invisible
in
hieroglyphs
that
blazed
and
leaped
like
light
unto
the
eyes
a
thousand
times
we
read
a
thousand
turn
the
page
and
understand
and
think
we
know
the
record
of
a
life
when
lo
if
we
will
open
once
again
the
awful
volume
hid
mysterious
intent
there
lies
the
unseen
alphabet
the
tale
from
breath
to
death
and
spells
a
living
language
that
we
never
knew
this
that
i
read
was
one
short
song
of
hers
a
fragment
i
interpret
or
a
lost
faint
prelude
to
another
missing
too
she
sang
it
says
the
text
one
summer
night
after
the
vespers
when
the
abbess
passed
and
blessed
her
when
the
nuns
were
gone
and
when
she
kneeling
in
her
drowsy
cell
had
said
her
prayers
poor
soul
her
sorrowful
prayers
in
which
she
had
besought
the
lord
for
his
dear
sake
and
love
and
pity
of
his
only
son
to
wash
her
of
her
stain
and
make
her
fit
on
summer
nights
behind
the
convent
bars
and
on
with
bruisèd
lips
to
pray
away
all
vision
but
repentance
from
her
soul
when
kneeling
as
she
was
her
limbs
refused
to
bear
her
and
she
fell
afaint
from
weariness
and
striving
to
become
a
holy
woman
all
her
splendid
length
upon
the
ground
and
groveled
there
aghast
that
buried
nature
was
not
dead
in
her
but
lived
a
rebel
through
her
fair
fierce
youth
aghast
to
find
that
clasped
hands
would
clench
aghast
to
feel
that
praying
lips
refused
like
saints
to
murmur
on
but
shrank
and
quivered
dumb
alas
i
can
not
pray
cried
guinevere
i
can
not
pray
i
will
not
lie
god
is
an
honest
god
and
i
will
be
an
honest
sinner
to
his
face
will
it
be
wicked
if
i
sing
oh
let
me
sing
a
little
of
i
know
not
what
let
me
just
sing
i
know
not
why
for
lips
grow
stiff
with
praying
the
night
let
me
believe
that
i
am
happy
too
a
blessèd
blessèd
woman
who
is
fit
to
sing
because
she
did
not
sin
or
else
that
god
forgot
it
for
a
little
while
and
does
not
mind
me
very
much
dear
lord
said
guinevere
wilt
thou
not
listen
while
i
sing
as
well
as
while
i
pray
i
shall
feel
safer
so
for
i
have
naught
to
say
god
should
not
hear
the
song
comes
as
the
prayer
doth
come
thou
listenest
i
sing
the
night
and
high
were
the
skies
and
higher
the
eyes
that
leaned
like
the
stars
of
my
soul
to
me
whom
loveth
the
queen
him
who
hath
right
to
crown
her
who
but
the
king
is
he
the
day
and
gold
was
the
hair
and
golden
the
mist
that
blinded
my
soul
away
from
me
dethroned
for
a
dream
for
a
gleam
for
a
glance
for
a
color
how
could
the
crownèd
be
goeth
by
like
a
deed
nor
returneth
forever
death
cometh
on
as
pity
should
be
hush
when
she
waketh
at
last
and
looketh
about
her
whom
will
a
woman
see
thus
in
her
cell
deep
in
the
summer
night
sang
guinevere
a
little
broken
blind
sweet
melody
and
then
she
kneeled
upon
the
convent
floor
and
peaceful
finished
all
her
prayer
and
slept
for
she
had
naught
to
say
god
might
not
hear
sung
to
a
friend
the
tide
is
rising
rising
out
of
the
infinite
sea
from
ripple
to
wave
to
billow
past
beryl
and
gold
and
crimson
a
prism
of
perfect
splendor

shall
the
white

be

rising
rising
for
you
and
me
defiant
across
the

wave
unto

answer
the

to
the
shore

follow
when
shall
the
great
flood
be
the

turn
falling
falling

to
the
awful

thus
far
shalt
thou
go
no
farther
the
color
sinks
to
the
shadow
the
pæan
sobs
into
silence
where
shall
the
be
by
the
weeds
left
blazing
beating
like
of
the
sea
by
the
law
of
the
land
and
the
ocean
by
the
hand
that
holdeth
the
torrent
i
summon

to
flow
for
you
and
me

lost
from
the
loaded
tree
the
sweetest
blossom
of
the
may

be
or
wildest
song
that
summer
could
have
heard
is
dumb
within
the
throat
of
the
dead
bird
the
perfect
statue
that
all
men
have
sought
may
in
some
crippled
hand
be
hid
unwrought
which
of
our
dearest
dead
betook
his
flight
into
the
star
that
fell
last
night
the
words
forever
by
thy
lips
unsaid

been
the
crown
of
life
upon
thy

on
a
sky
of
steel
and
ice
the
baffled
sun
stabs
wildly
at
the
gale
the
water
rises
like
a
god
aglow
who
all
too
long
hath
slept
and
dreamed
too
sure
and
finds
his
goddess

his
empty
arms

the
mighty

at

that
rage
of
elemental
tenderness
the
old
omnipotent
caress
she
knows
yet
once
the
solid
earth
did
melt
for
her
and
pitying
made
retreat
before
her
flight

have

the

upon

the

of
waking
spring
fell
vivid
as
the
shadow
thrown
far
from
the
gleaming
wing
of
a
great
golden
bird
that
fled
before
us
loitering
in
hours
before
the
spring
how
light
the
pulse
of
heaviest
feet
and
quick
the
slowest
hopes

stir
to
measures
fine
and

removed
apart
from
out

reverent
feet

golden
day
stood
in
a
quiet
place
that
held
repressed
i
know
not
what
of
such
a
poignant
grace
as
falls
if
dumb
with
life
untold
upon
a
human
face
to
fashion
silence
into
words
the
softest
teach
me
how
i
know
the
place
is
silence
caught
then
and
now
i
only
know
was
blue
above
and
it
was
green
below
and
where
the
deepening
sunshine
found
and
held
a
holy
mood
lowly
and
old
of
outline
quaint
in
mingled
brick
and
wood
clasped
in
the
arms
of
ivy
vines
a
nestling
cottage
stood
a
thing
so
hidden
and
so
fair
so
pure
that
it
would
seem
hewn
out
of
nothing
earthlier
than
a
young
poet
dream
of
nothing
sadder
than
the
lights
that
through
the
ivies
gleam
tell
me
i
said
while
shrill
the
birds
sang
through
the
garden
space
to
her
who
guided
me
tell
me
the
story
of
the
place
she
lifted
in
her
quaker
cap
a
peaceful
puzzled
face
surveyed
me
with
an
aged
calm
and
unpoetic
eye
and
peacefully
but
puzzled
half
half
tolerant
made
reply
the
people
come
to
see
that
house
indeed
i
know
not
why
except
thee
know
the
poem
there
was
written
long
since
yet
his
name
who
wrote
it
now
in
fact
i
can
not
seem
to
get
his
name
who
wrote
that
poetry
i
always
do
forget
was
evangeline
and
here
in
sound
of
christ
church
bells
she
found
her
lover
in
this
house
or
so
i
heard
folks
tell
but
most
i
know
is
that
her
name
and
his
was
gabriel
i
heard
she
found
him
dying
in
the
room
behind
that
door
one
of
the
friends
old
almshouses
perhaps
thee
heard
before
perhaps
thee
heard
about
her
all
that
i
can
tell
and
more
thee
can
believe
she
found
him
here
if
thee
do
so
incline
folks
have
their
fashions
in
belief
that
may
be
one
of
thine
i
sure
his
name
was
gabriel
and
hers
evangeline
she
turned
her
to
her
common
work
and
unpoetic
ways
nor
knew
the
rare
sweet
note
she
struck
resounding
to
your
praise
o
poet
of
our
common
nights
and
of
our
days
translator
of
our
golden
mood
and
of
our
leaden
hour
immortal
thus
shall
poet
gauge
the
horizon
of
his
power
wear
in
your
crown
of
laurel
leaves
the
little
ivy
flower
and
happy
be
the
singer
called
to
such
a
lofty
lot
and
ever
blessed
be
the
heart
hid
in
the
simple
spot
where
evangeline
was
loved
and
wept
and
longfellow
forgot
o
striving

strive
quietly
thou
art
or
dost
sweetest
the
strain
when
in
the
song
the
singer
has
been
lost

the

when

not
doer
counts
for
most
the
shadow
of
the
golden

brooded
over

sad

that
day

evangeline
led
by
your
voice
o
solemn

bell
for
lovers
of
all
springs
all
climes
at

found

against

fair
how

called

to
me

idle
hours
for

so
blest
in
bruising
your
white
faces
on

shore
so
happy
to
be
wasted
with

stepped
stately

all

the

conducted
them
with

high
a
rock
glittering
with
joy
stood
to
receive
the
shock
of
the
i
saw
it
in
the
mind
of
sleep
and
silence
when
i
woke
i
wept
my
dreams
are
of
the
sea
but
oh
it
is
the
sea
of
glass
i
met
that
other
tide
as
i
desired
alone
the
rock
and
i
leaned
to
the
wave
a
foolish
suicide
that
scooped
its
grave
within
the
piteous
sand
now
i
am
tired
it
died
and
it
was
buried
let
me
pass
song
the
firelight
listens
on
the
floor
to
hear
the
wild
winds
blow
within
the
bursting
roses
burn
without
there
slides
the
snow
across
the
flower
i
see
the
flake
pass
mirrored
mystic
slow
oh
blooms
and
storms
must
blush
and
freeze
while
seasons
come
and
go
i
lift
the
sash
and
live
the
gale
comes
leaping
to
my
call
the
rose
is
but
a
painted
one
that
hangs
upon

from

from
discord
to

life
moveth
on
from
terror
and
heartbreak
from
anger
of
anguish
from
vigil

a

gone

through

of

the

of

flying
soulless

we
with

unquenched

upon

the

that
brave
race
of

swifter
than

his

that
did
not

calmer
than
love
the
hand
which
reached
that
goal
a
torch
it
bore
and
cherished
to
the
end
and
rescued
from
the
winds
the
sacred
fire
o

the
race
o

the

hush
and
listen
long
enough
to
learn
of
him
who
sleeps
beneath
the
dust
with
his

thy

weariness
and
wail
who
doubles

doubles

steadfast
pure

at
the
promethean

young

ran
with

lighted
from
the

in

only
he
was

whose

remained
unextinguished

were
his

they
could
have
held
the
need
of
half
the

up
and
in
his

were
iron
atoms
too
thus
was
he
built
his

observe
was
wrought
of

burnished
it
dazzled
one
to

at

his

were

so
he

thee

but
save
oh
save
the

of

for
one
who
did
beholding
trust
in
it
iv
at
the
party
half
a
dozen
children
at
our
house
half
a
dozen
children
quiet
as
a
mouse
quiet
as
a
moonbeam
you
could
hear
a
pin
waiting
for
the
party
to
begin
such
a
flood
of
flounces
oh
dear
me
such
a
surge
of
sashes
like
a
silken
sea
little
eyes
demurely
cast
upon
the
ground
little
airs
and
graces
all
around
high
time
for
that
party
to
begin
to
sit
so
any
longer
were
a
sort
of
sin
as
if
you
were
acquainted
with
society
what
a
thing
to
tell
of
that
would
be
up
spoke
a
little
lady
aged
five
i
tumbled
up
my
sure
as
i
alive
dress
came
from
paris
we
sent
to
worth
for
it
mother
says
she
calls
it
such
a
fit
quick
there
piped
another
little
voice
did
send
for
dresses
though
i
had
my
choice
have
got
a
doll
that
came
from
paris
too
it
can
walk
and
talk
as
well
as
you
still
till
now
there
sat
one
little
girl
simple
as
a
without
flounce
or
curl
modest
as
a
primrose
soft
plain
hair
brushed
back
but
the
color
of
her
dress
was
black
all
black
swift
she
glanced
around
with
sweet
surprise
bright
and
grave
the
look
that
widened
in
her
eyes
to
entertain
the
party
she
must
do
her
share
as
if
god
had
sent
her
stood
she
there
stood
a
minute
thinking
with
crossed
hands
how
she
best
might
meet
the
company
demands
grave
and
sweet
the
purpose
to
the
child
voice
given
have
a
little
brother
gone
to
heaven
on
the
little
party
dropped
a
spell
all
the
little
flounces
rustled
where
they
fell
but
the
modest
maiden
in
her
mourning
gown
unconscious
as
a
flower
looketh
down
quick
my
heart
besought
her
silently
happy
little
maiden
give
o
give
to
me
the
highness
of
your
courage
the
sweetness
of
your
grace
to
speak
a
large
word
in
a
little
place
a
jewish
legend
i
like
that
old
kind
legend
not
found
in
holy
writ
and
wish
that
john
or
matthew
had
made
bible
out
of
it
but
though
it
is
not
gospel
there
is
no
law
to
hold
the
heart
from
growing
better
that
hears
the
story
told
how
the
little
jewish
children
upon
a
summer
day
went
down
across
the
meadows
with
the
child
christ
to
play
and
in
the
valley
where
low
the
lay
they
made
them
mock
out
of
the
meadow
clay
so
when
these
all
were
fashioned
and
ranged
in
rows
about
now
said
the
little
jesus
we
let
the
birds
fly
out
then
all
the
happy
children
did
call
and
coax
and
cry
each
to
his
own
fly
as
i
bid
you
fly
but
earthen
were
the
sparrows
and
earth
they
did
remain
though
loud
the
jewish
children
cried
out
and
cried
again
except
the
one
bird
only
the
little
lord
christ
made
the
earth
that
owned
him
master
his
earth
heard
and
obeyed
softly
he
leaned
and
whispered
fly
up
to
heaven
fly
and
swift
his
little
sparrow
went
soaring
to
the
sky
and
silent
all
the
children
stood
awestruck
looking
on
till
deep
into
the
heavens
the
bird
of
earth
had
gone
i
like
to
think
for
playmate
we
have
the
lord
christ
still
and
that
still
above
our
weakness
he
works
his
mighty
will
that
all
our
little
playthings
of
earthen
hopes
and
joys
shall
be
by
his
commandment
changed
into
heavenly
toys
our
souls
are
like
the
sparrows
imprisoned
in
the
clay
bless
him
who
came
to
give
them
wings
upon
a
christmas
day
the
songs
of
seventy
years
master
let
stronger
lips
than
these
turn
melody
to
harmony
poet
mine
tremble
as
they
crave
a
word
alone
with
thee
thy
songs
melt
on
the
vibrant
air
the
wild
birds
know
them
and
the
wind
the
common
light
hath
claim
on
them
the
common
heart
and
mind
and
air
and
light
and
wind
shall
be
thy
while
they
say
how
seventy
years
of
music
stir
the
common
pulse
hush
sweetest
songs
mine
ears
are
deaf
to
all
of
ye
save
only
one
blind
are
the
eyes
that
turn
the
leaf
against
the
autumn
sun
oh
blinder
once
were
fading
eyes
close
folded
now
from
shine
and
rain
and
duller
were
the
dying
ears
that
heard
the
chosen
strain
stay
solemn
chant
is
mine
to
sing
your
notes
alone
below
the
breath
is
mine
to
bless
the
poet
who
can
bless
the
hour
of
death
for
once
a
spirit
sighed
for
home
a
light
whereby
to
see
and
wearied
found
the
way
to
them
o
christian
seer
through
thee
passed
with
thy
words
on
paling
lips

with
thy
courage
to
depart

with
thy
trust
within
the
soul
thy
music

the
heart
oh
calm
above
our
restlessness
and
rich
beyond
our
dreaming
yet
in
heaven
i
know
one
owes
to
thee
a
glad
and
grateful
debt
from
it
may
learn
some
tenderer
art
may
find
and
take
some
better
way

all
our
tenderest
and
best

crown
thy
life

seventy
years

her
blessed
men
she
put
the
silver
lyre
aside
for
you
she
could
not
stroll
across
the
idle
strings
of
fancy
while
you
wept
uncomforted
but
rang
upon
the
fetters
of
a
race
enchained
the
awful
chord
which
pealed
along
and
echoed
in
the
that
broke
the
manacle
and
bade
the
bound
go
free
she
brought
a
nation
on
its
knees
for
shame
she
brought
a
world
into
a
black
slave
heart
where
are
our
lighter
laurels
o
my
friends
brothers
and
sisters
of
the
busy
pen
five
million
freemen

birthday

before
whose
feet
our
little
leaf
we
lay

and
call
her
blessed
fainting
souls
for
whom
she
sang
the
strains
of
holy
hope
within
the
gentle
twilight
of
her
days
like
angels
bid
her
own
hymns
visit
her
her
life
no
door
but
wide
and
welcome
to
his
solemn
feet
who
need
not
knock
for
entrance
nor
one
ever
ask
who
cometh
there
so
still
and
sure
the
step
so
well
we
know
god
doth
abide
in
her
oh
wait
to
make
her
blessed
happy
world
to
which
she
looketh
onward
ardently
lie
in
fair
distance
far
ye
streets
of
gold
where
up
and
down
spirits
walk
and
wonder
that
they
stayed
so
long
away
be
patient
for
her
coming
for
our
sakes
who
will
love
heaven
better
keeping
her
this
only
ask
we
when
from
prayer
to
praise
she
moves
and
when
from
peace
to
joy
be
hers
to
know
she
hath
the
life
eternal

give
you
gratitude
in
this
that
midway
on
the
precipice
you
never
trod
and
never
saw
where
air
you
never
drank
strikes
raw
and
wan
upon
the
wasted
breath
and
gulfs
you
never
passed
gape
death
and
crags
you
gained
some
sunlit
way
frown
threatening
over
me
that
here
with
bruisèd
hand
i
cling
because
i

you
yonder

with

who

in

with

i
had
no
song
so
wise
and
sweet
as
birthday
songs
dear
friend
should
be
silent
among
a
hundred
guests
i
only
prayed
for
thee
such
wishes
held
the
speaking
lip
such
mood
of
blessing
took
me
there
that
music
like
a
bird
to
heaven
flew
and
was
lost
in
prayer
whose
shall
the
welcome
be
the
wave
goes
down
the
wind
goes
down
the
gray
tide
glitters
on
the
sea
the
moon
seems
praying
in
the
sky
gates
of
the
new
jerusalem
a
perfect
pearl
each
gate
of
them
wide
as
all
heaven
swing
on
high
whose
shall
the
welcome
be
the
wave
went
down
the

went
down
the
tide
of
life
turned
out
to
sea
patience
of
pain
and
grace
of
deed
the
glories
of
the
heart
and
brain
treasure
that
shall
not
come
again
the
human
singing
that
we
need
set
to
a
heavenly
key
the
wave
goes
down
the
wind
goes
down
all
tides
at
last
turn
to
the
sea
we
learn
to
take
the
thing
we
have
thou
who
hast
taught
us
strength
in
grief
as
moon
to
shadow
high
and
chief
shine
out

soul
beyond
the
grave
and

our
loss
of
thee
exeat
to
the
hope
that
he
has
taught
to
the
beauty
he
has
wrought
to
the
comfort
he
has
been
to
the
dream
that
poets
tell
to
the
land
where
gabriel

not

evangeline
hush
let
him
go
george
eliot
at
evening
once
the
lowly
men
who
loved
our
master
were
found
desolate
and
grieved
for
him
whose
eyes
had
been
the
glory
of
their
lives
he
silent
followed
them
and
joined
himself
unto
their
sorrow
with
the
voice
of
love
that
liveth
past
the
end
and
yearns
like
empty
arms
across
the
sepulchre
did
comfort
them
they
heard
and
knew
him
not
at
eventide
o
lord
one
trod
for
us
the
solitary
way
of
a
great
soul
whereof
the
peril
pain
and
debt
alone
he
knows
who
marked
the
road
we
watched
and
held
her
in
our
arms
of
prayer
we
wept
and
said
our
sister
hath
a
heavy
hurt
we
bow
and
cry
the
crown
is
buried
with
the
queen
at
twilight
as
she
groping
sought
for
rest
what
solemn
footfall
echoed
down
the
dark
what
tenderness
that
would
not
let
her
go
and
patience
that
love
only
knoweth
paced
silent
beside
her
to
the
last
faint
step
what
scarred
hand
gently
caught
her
as
she
sank

the
awful
truth
whereby
we
live
and
move
and
know
the
true
i
ask
thee
to
be
true
unto
thyself
there
is
a
soul
that
has
not
sinned
unto
the
death
i
pray
for
it
to
such
as
seek
for
such
a
one
o
power
invisible
o
mystery
and
mercy
thou
hast
said
thou
hearkenest
i
dare
remind
thee
god
i
dare
appeal
unto
thine
honor
hear
fulfill
thy
pledge
to
me
god
god
great
god
i
pour
my
soul
out
dash
it
down
awaste
like
water
as
i
would
my
life
to
save
this
other
one
i
light
my
words
with
fire
like
fagots
scorching
all
my
shrinking
heart
so
would
i
walk
in
fire
with
these
my
feet
of
flesh
if
that
could
melt
this
frozen
heart
i
pray
for
thou
who
listenest
dumb
god
had
i
thy
dreadful
power
to
turn
the
souls
of
men
as
they
were
rivers
in
thy
hand
then
would
i
have
this
noble
one
i
would
not
lose
its
loyalty
i
tell
thee
lord
if
i
had
made
it
then
it
sure
should
love
and
honor
me
hearken
to
me
oh
save
give
me
mine
answer
save
great
god
i
summon
thee
i
summon
thee
father
i
am
thy
child
if
i
have
asked
too
much
or
asked
or
longed
amiss
in
any
wise
or
read
awry
thy
word
mysterious
or
made
one
cry
unworthy
of
a
child
i
pray
thee
to
deny
me
all
i
ask
unto
my
asking
and
rebuke
me
so
and
if
thou
savest
lord
dear
lord
then
let
it
be
because
some
worthier
than
i
did
pray
an
acknowledgment
for
the
faith
that
is
not
broken
by
the
burden
of
the
day
for
the
word
that
is
not
spoken
dearest
words
are
slow
to
say
for
the
golden
draught
unproffered
to
the
thirst
that
thirsteth
on
for
the
hand
that
is
not
offered
when
the
struggling
strength
is
gone
for
the
sturdy
heart
that
will
not
make
a
pauper
of
my
need
friend
i
mean
sometime
to
thank
thee
from
my
soul
in
truth
and
deed
wait
some
day
when
i
am
braver
i
will
do
so
say
so
now
oh
be
tender
i
am
tired
i
have
forgotten
how
hymn
for
a
brother
installation
lord
are
there
any
stones
upon
the
way
that
tear
thy
bleeding
feet
if
our
weak
hands
can
move
them
from
thy
path
give
us
that
duty
sweet
is
there
o
patient
and
pathetic
face
one
thorn
upon
thy
brow
that
we
can
pluck
from
out
thy
cruel
crown
for
we
would
do
it
now
is
there
a
deed
so
difficult
for
us
that
none
but
thou
canst
ask
thine
asking
be
our
answering
lo
swift
be
ours
that
happy
task
lord
hast
thou
left
thy
hungry
in
the
world
for
us
to
find
to
feed
sharper
the
hungers
of
the
soul
give
us
nutrition
for
that
need
and
hast
thou
prisoners
unvisited
whose
woes
our
care
should
tell
there
is
a
deeper
prison
of
the
heart
help
us
to
find
that
cell
is
there
a
mourner
dear
to
thee
whom
we
have
left
uncomforted
yet
still
through
lonelier
loneliness
the
heart
bereft
of
thee
is
led
o
world
of
common
human
cries
and
calls
of
souls
in
direst
need
to
meet
ye
mighty
were
the
love
that
sought
to
take
the
master
speed
give
us
that
love
dear
god
who
gave
to
us
to
bear
his
loving
name
give
us
that
sacred
speed
to
keep
the
step
that
strikes
with
his
the
same
waves
of
one
tide
this
people
be
and
flow
straight
shoreward
to
thy
will
white
as
a
dove
upon
them
now
descend
thy
spirit
strong
and
still
thy
blessings
on
their
future
rest
and
brood
the
brightest
lip
can
tell
in
home
and
heart
in
faith
and
fact
o
best
of
daily
mercy
dwell
with
those
who
summon
trusting
it
to
lead
their
feet
to
walk
christ
way
the
voice
of
him
on
whose
bowed
head
i
call
the
grace
of
god
answered
why
did
i
never
sing
a
song
to
you
dearest
to
you
again
behold
the
question
start
to
mine
own
pulses
have
i
ever
sung
or
do
i
read
a
rhyme
unto
my
beating
heart
westward
my
thoughts
like
waves
creep
up
creep
on
how
patient
is
the
sea
how
shall
we
climb
the
tide
and
i
up
to
the
hills
and
thee
were
waters
free
as
winds
to
go
where
mood
or
need
might
be
they
could
but
find
the
sky
above
the
cañon
as
the
sea
three
friends
oh
not
to
you
my
mentor
sweet
and
stern
as
only
sweetness
can
whose
grave
eyes
look
out
steadfastly
across
my
nature
plan
and
take
unerring
measure
down
that
plan
is
failed
or
foiled
thinking
far
less
of
purpose
kept
than
of
a
vision
spoiled
and
tender
less
to
what
i
am
than
sad
for
what
i
might
have
been
and
walking
softly
before
god
for
my
soul
sake
i
ween
is
not
to
you
my
spirit
leans
o
grave
true
judge
when
spent
with
strife
and
groping
out
of
gloom
for
light
and
out
of
death
for
life
nor
yet
to
you
who
calmly
weigh
and
measure
every
grace
and
fault
whose
martial
nature
never
turns
from
right
to
left
to
halt
for
any
glamour
of
the
heart
or
any
glow
that
ever
is
grander
than
truth
high
noonday
glare
in
love
sweet
sunrises
who
know
me
by
the
duller
hues
of
common
nights
and
common
days
and
in
their
sober
atmospheres
find
level
blame
and
praise
true
hearts
and
dear
is
not
in
you
this
fainting
warring
soul
of
mine
finds
silver
carven
chalices
to
hold
life
choicest
wine
unto
its
thirsty
lips
and
bid
it
drink
and
breathe
and
battle
on
till
all
its
dreams
are
deeds
at
last
and
all
its
heights
are
won
i
turn
to
confiding
love
o
lifted
eyes
look
trustfully
till
heaven
shall
lend
you
other
light
like
kneeling
saints
on
me
and
let
me
be
to
you
dear
eyes
the
thing
i
am
not
till
i
too
shall
see
as
i
am
seen
and
stand
at
last
revealed
to
you
and
let
me
nobler
than
i
am
and
braver
still
eternally
and
finer
truer
purer
than
my
finest
purest
be
to
your
sweet
vision
there
i
stand
transfigured
fair
in
love
deceit
and
while
your
soul
looks
up
to
mine
my
heart
lies
at
your
feet
believe
me
better
than
my
best
and
stronger
than
my
strength
can
hold
until
your
magic
faith
transmute
my
pebbles
into
gold
i
the
thing
you
hold
me
dear
after
i
dead
if
not
before
nor
through
the
climbing
ages
will
i
give
the
conflict
but
if
upon
the
perfect
peace
and
past
the
thing
that
was
and
is
and
past
the
lure
of
voices
in
a
world
of
silences
a
pain
can
crawl
a
little
one
a
cloud
upon
a
sunlit
land
i
think
in
heaven
my
heart
must
ache
that
you
should
understand
a
