the
brownies
at
school
as
brownies
rambled
one
night
a
country
schoolhouse
came
in
sight
and
there
they
paused
awhile
to
speak
about
the
place
where
through
the
week
the
scholars
came
with
smile
or
whine
illustration
each
morning
at
the
stroke
of
nine
this
is
said
one
the
place
indeed
where
children
come
to
write
and
read
is
here
through
rules
and
rods
to
suit
the
young
idea
learns
to
shoot
and
here
the
idler
with
a
grin
in
nearest
neighbor
pokes
the
pin

or
sighs
to
break
his
scribbled
slate
and
spring
at
once
to
man

how
oft
from
shades
of
yonder
grove
i
viewed
at
eve
the
shouting

as
from
the
door
they
crowding
broke
like
oxen

beneath

the
more
they
talked
the
stronger
grew
the
wish
to
prove
how
much
they
knew
from
page
to
page
through
books
to
pass
and
spell
the
words
that
tried
the
class
so
through
their
skill
they
soon
obtained
access
to
all
the

contained

i

some
lessons
quite
by

kept
it
turning

often
heard
it
said

here
indeed
we
find
it

the
poles

some
with

expressions
bold
surveyed
the
globe
as
it
rolled

others
turned
to
ink

and
spreading
like
a
brooding
hen
they
scrawled
a

to

the
teacher
had
enough
to
do
to
act
his
part

nature

he
lectured
well
the
infant

he
rapped
the
desk

shook
the
rod

stood
the
dunce
upon
the
stool
a
to
all
the
school
but
frequent
changes
please
the
crowd
so
lengthy
reign
was
not
allowed
and
when
one
master
had
his
hour
another
took
the
rod
of
power
and
thus
they
changed
to
suit
the
case
till
many
filled
the
honored
place
illustration
so
taken
up
was
every
mind
with
fun
and
study
well
combined
illustration
they
noticed
not
the
hours
depart
until
the
sun
commenced
to
dart
a
sheaf
of
lances
long
and
bright
above
the
distant
mountain
height
then
from
the
schoolroom
in
a
heap
they
jumped
and
tumbled
twenty
deep
in
eager
haste
to
disappear
in
deepest
shades
of
forests
near
when
next
the
children
gathered
there
with
wondering
faces
fresh
and
fair
it
took
an
hour
of
morning
prime
according
to
the
teacher
time
to
get
the
books
in
place
once
more
and
order
to
the
room
restore
so
great
had
been
the
haste
to
hide
the
windows
were
left
open
wide
and
scholars
knew
without
a
doubt
that
brownies
had
been
thereabout
illustration
illustration
the
brownies
ride
one
night
a
cunning
brownie
band
was
roaming
through
a
farmer
land
and
while
the
rogues
went
prying
the
farmer
mare
at
rest
they
found
and
peeping
through
the
they
saw
the
harness
that
she
wore
the
sight
was
tempting
to
the
eye
for
there
the
cart
was
standing
nigh
illustration
that
mare
said
one
deserves
her
feed
believe
me
she
no
common
breed
her
grit
is
good
i
seen
her
dash
up
yonder
slope
without
the
lash
until
her
load
a
ton
of
hay
went
bouncing
in
beside
the
bay
in
this
same
cart
old
farmer
gill
takes
all
his
corn
and
wheat
to
mill
it
must
be
strong
though
rude
and
rough
it
runs
on
wheels
and
that
enough
illustration
now
brownies
seldom
idle
stand
when
there
a
chance
for
fun
at
hand
illustration
so
plans
were
laid
without
delay
the
mare
was
dragged
from
oats
and
hay
the
harness
from
the
peg
they
drew
and
every
one
to
action
flew
it
was
a
sight
one
should
behold
to
see
them
working
young
and
old
two
wrinkled
elves
like
leather
browned
whose
beards
descended
near
the
ground
along
with
youngsters
did
their
best
with
all
the
ardor
of
the
rest
illustration
while
some
prepared
a
rein
or
trace
another
slid
the
bit
in
place
more
buckled
bands
with
all
their
might
or
drew
the
harness
close
and
tight
illustration
when
every
strap
a
buckle
found
and
every
part
was
safe
and
sound
then
the
cart
the
brownies
flew
the
hardest
task
was
yet
to
do
it
often
puzzles
bearded
men
though
and
performed
again
some
held
the
shafts
to
steer
them
straight
more
did
their
best
to
balance
weight
while
others
showed
both
strength
and
art
in
backing
mag
into
the
cart
at
length
the
heavy
job
was
done
and
horse
and
cart
moved
off
as
one
illustration
now
down
the
road
the
gentle
steed
was
forced
to
trot
at
greatest
speed
illustration
a
merrier
crowd
than
journeyed
there
was
never
seen
at
dublin
fair
some
found
a
seat
while
others
stood
or
hung
behind
as
best
they
could
while
many
strung
along
astride
upon
the
mare
enjoyed
the
ride
illustration
the
night
was
dark
the
lucky
elves
had
all
the
turnpike
to
themselves
no
surly
keeper
barred
the
way
for
use
of
road
demanding
pay
nor
were
they
startled
by
the
cry
of
robbers
shouting
stand
or
die
across
the
bridge
and
up
the
hill
and
through
the
woods
to
warren
mill
a
lengthy
ride
ten
miles
at
least
without
a
rest
they
drove
the
beast
and
then
were
loath
enough
to
rein
old
mag
around
for
home
again
illustration
nor
was
the
speed
returning
slow
the
mare
was
more
inclined
to
go
because
the
feed
of
oats
and
hay
unfinished
in
her
manger
lay
so
through
the
yard
she
wheeled
her
load
as
briskly
as
she
took
the
road
no
time
remained
to
then
undo
the
many
straps
which
tight
they
drew
for
in
the
east
the
reddening
sky
gave
warning
that
the
sun
was
nigh
illustration
illustration
the
halter
rope
was
quickly
wound
about
the
nearest
post
they
found
then
off
they
scampered
left
and
right
and
disappeared
at
once
from
sight
illustration
when
farmer
gill
that
morning
fair
came
out
and
viewed
his
jaded
mare
i
may
not
here
in
verse
repeat
his
exclamations
all
complete
he
gnashed
his
teeth
and
glared
around
and
struck
his
fists
and
stamped
the
ground
and
chased
the
dog
across
the
farm
because
it
failed
to
give
alarm
i
give
a
stack
of
hay
he
cried
to
catch
the
rogue
who
stole
the
ride
but
still
awry
suspicion
flew
who
stole
the
ride
he
never
knew
illustration
the
brownies
on
skates
one
night
when
the
cold
moon
hung
low
and
winter
wrapped
the
world
in
snow
and
bridged
the
streams
in
wood
and
field
with
ice
as
smooth
as
shining
shield
some
skaters
swept
in
graceful
style
the
glistening
surface
file
on
file
for
hours
the
brownies
viewed
the
show
commenting
on
the
groups
below
illustration
illustration
said
one
that
pleasure
might
be
ours
we
have
the
feet
and
motive
powers
no
mortal
need
us
brownies
teach
if
skates
were
but
within
our
reach
another
answered
then
my
friend
to
hear
my
plan
let
all
attend
i
have
a
building
in
my
mind
that
we
within
an
hour
can
find
three
golden
balls
hang
by
the
door
like
oranges
from
cuba
shore
behind
the
dusty
counter
stands
a
native
of
queer
lands
the
place
is
filled
with
various
things
illustration
from
to
illustration
here
hangs
a
gun
without
a
lock
some
pilgrim
bore
to
plymouth
rock
illustration
and
there
a
pair
of
goggles
lie
that
saw
the
marching
by
illustration
while
piles
of
club
and
rocker
skates
of
every
shape
the
buyer
waits
though
i
sure
they
do
and
serve
our
wants
as
well
as
new
that
place
we
enter
as
we
may
night
and
bear
away
a
pair
the
best
that
come
to
hand
for
every
member
of
the
band
at
once
the
enterprise
so
bold
received
support
from
young
and
old
a
place
to
muster
near
the
town
and
meeting
hour
they
noted
down
and
then
retiring
for
the
night
they
soon
were
lost
to
sound
and
sight
when
evening
next
her
visit
paid
to
fold
the
earth
in
robes
of
shade
from
out
the
woods
across
the
mead
the
brownies
gathered
as
agreed
to
venture
boldly
and
procure
illustration
the
skates
that
would
their
fun
insure
as
mice
can
get
to
cake
and
cheese
without
a
key
they
please
so
cunning
brownies
can
proceed
and
help
themselves
to
what
they
need
illustration
for
bolts
and
bars
they
little
care
if
but
a
nail
is
wanting
there
or
failing
this
with
ease
descend
like
santa
claus
and
gain
their
end
as
children
to
the
windows
fly
at
news
of
jumbo
passing
by
so
rushed
the
eager
band
away
to
fields
of
ice
without
delay
though
far
too
large
at
heel
and
toe
the
skates
were
somehow
made
to
go
but
out
behind
and
out
before
like
spurs
they
stuck
a
span
or
more
alike
afflicting
foe
and
friend
in
bringing
journeys
to
an
end
they
had
their
slips
and
sudden
spreads
where
heels
flew
higher
than
their
heads
as
people
do
however
nice
when
venturing
first
upon
the
ice
but
soon
they
learned
to
curve
and
wheel
and
cut
fine
scrolls
with
scoring
steel
to
race
in
clusters
to
and
fro
to
jump
and
turn
and
backward
go
until
a
rest
on
bed
so
cool
was
more
the
wonder
than
the
rule
illustration
but
from
the
lake
they
all
withdrew
some
hours
before
the
night
was
through
and
hastened
back
with
lively
feet
through
narrow
lane
and
silent
street
until
they
reached
the
broker
door
with
every
skate
that
left
the
store
and
ere
the
first
faint
gleam
of
day
the
skates
were
safely
stowed
away
of
their
brief
absence
not
a
trace
was
left
within
the
dusty
place
illustration
the
brownies
on
bicycles
illustration
one
evening
brownies
peeping
down
from
bluffs
that
overlooked
the
town
saw
wheelmen
passing
to
and
fro
upon
the
boulevard
below
it
seems
said
one
an
easy
trick
the
wheel
goes
so
smooth
and
quick
you
simply
sit
and
work
your
feet
and
glide
with
grace
along
the
street
the
pleasure
would
be
fine
indeed
if
could
thus
in
line
proceed
illustration
last
night
another
answer
made
as
by
the
river
bank
i
strayed
where
here
and
there
a
building
stands
and
town
and
join
hands
before
me
stood
a
massive
wall
with
and
chimneys
tall
illustration
to
scale
the
place
a
way
i
found
and
creeping
in
looked
all
around
there
bicycles
of
every
grade
are
manufactured
for
the
trade
some
made
for
baby
hands
to
guide
and
some
for
older
folk
to
ride
though
built
to
keep
intruders
out
with
shutters
thick
and
casings
stout
i
noticed
twenty
ways
or
more
by
roof
by
window
wall
and
door
where
we
by
exercising
skill
may
travel
in
and
out
at
will
another
spoke
in
nowise
slow
to
catch
at
pleasures
as
they
go
and
said
why
let
another
day
come
creeping
in
to
drag
away
let
active
measures
now
employ
to
seize
at
once
the
promised
joy
on
bicycles
quick
let
us
ride
while
yet
our
wants
may
be
supplied
so
when
the
town
grew
hushed
and
still
the
brownies
ventured
down
the
hill
and
soon
the
band
was
drawing
nigh
the
building
with
the
chimneys
high
illustration
when
people
lock
their
doors
at
night
and
them
left
and
right
and
think
through
patents
new
and
old
to
leave
the
burglars
in
the
cold
the
cunning
brownies
smile
to
see
the
springing
bolt
and
turning
key
for
well
they
know
if
fancy
leads
their
band
to
venture
daring
deeds
the
miser
gold
the
merchant
ware
to
them
is
open
as
the
air
illustration
not
long
could
door
or
windows
stand
fast
locked
before
the
brownie
band
and
soon
the
bicycles
they
sought
from
every
room
and
bench
were
brought
the
rogues
ere
long
began
to
show
as
many
colors
as
the
bow
for
paint
and
varnish
lately
spread
besmeared
them
all
from
foot
to
head
some
turned
to
in
a
minute
and
some
as
quick
might
shame
the
linnet
while
more
with
breast
seemed
fitted
for
the
robin
nest
but
whether
red
or
green
or
blue
the
work
on
hand
was
hurried
through
they
took
the
wheels
from
blacksmith
fires
though
wanting
bolts
and
even
tires
and
rigged
the
parts
with
skill
and
speed
to
answer
well
their
pressing
need
and
soon
enough
were
made
complete
to
give
the
greater
part
a
seat
and
let
the
rest
through
cunning
find
some
way
of
hanging
on
behind
and
then
no
spurt
along
the
road
or
the
yard
their
courage
showed
but
twenty
times
a
measured
mile
they
whirled
away
in
single
file
or
bunched
together
in
a
crowd
if
width
of
road
or
skill
allowed
at
times
while
rolling
down
the
grade
collisions
some
confusion
made
for
every
member
of
the
band
at
steering
wished
to
try
his
hand
though
some
perhaps
were
not

misfortunes

unruffled
air

on

they
spun

wandered
through

a
building

ere

the
path

bearing
implements

the
sport
was
under

then
a
strange
and
stirring
scene
was
pictured
out
upon
the
green

some
watched
the

noted
well
where
this

excel

cried

the

threw

in

where

at

a
dozen
took
a

some
tangled
in

netting
lay
and
some
from
strayed
away
some
hit
the
ball
when
out

scrambled
through

still
no

was
forced
to
halt

there
they
sported
on

ere

some
invade

along
a
coated
pill

dose

still

kind
can
oft
disturb
a

mind
when
next
the
bat
of
evening
flew
and
drowsy
things
of
day
withdrew
when
beetles
droned
across
the
lea
and
turkeys
sought
the
safest
tree
to
form
aloft
a
social
row

cunning
brownies
might
be

advancing

bearing

pushing

swinging

seemed
eager

in
advance

all
the
throng
three
daring
brownies
moved
along
whose
duty
was
to
venture
close
and
give
the
barking
dog
his
dose

now
soon
the
work
was
under
way
each
chose
the
part

was
to
play

some
who
handled
hoes
the
best
brought
early
roses
from
their
nest
to
some
laid
their
hands

plied
the
hook

soon
the
sheaves
lay
piled
around

heroes

the

turn

pulling
carrots
from

prying
out

have
met
and
there
a
barrow
has
upset

workers
every
effort
strain
the
rolling
pumpkins
to
regain

long
before
the
stars
withdrew
the
crop
was
safe
the
work
was
through
in
shocks
the
corn
secure

good
now
like
a
sioux
encampment
stood
the
wheat
was
safely
stowed
away
in
bins
the
early
roses
lay

while
carrots
turnips
beets

all
received
attention
great
and
small
when
morning
dawned
no
sight

sound
of
friendly
brownies
could
be
found
and
when
at
last
old
towser
broke
the
spell
and
from
his
slumber
woke
he
rushed
around
believing
still
some
mischief
lay
behind
the
pill
but
though
the
field
looked
bare
and
strange
his
mind
could
hardly
grasp
the
change
and
when
the
farmer
learned
at
morn
that
safe
from
harm
were
wheat
and
corn
that
all
his
barley
oats
and
rye
were
in
the
barn
secure
and
dry
that
carrots
beets
and
turnips
round
were
safely
taken
from
the
ground
the
honest
farmer
thought
of
course
his
neighbors
had
turned
out
in
force
while
helpless
on
the
bed
he
lay
and
kindly
stowed
his
crop
away
illustration

but
when
he
thanked
them
for
their
aid
and
hoped
they
yet
might
be
repaid
for
acting
such
a
friendly
part
his
words
appeared
to
pierce
each
heart
for
well
they
knew
that
other
hands
than
theirs
had
laid
his
grain
in
bands
that
other
backs
had
bent
in
toil
to
save
the
products
of
the
soil
and
then
they
felt
as
such
folk
will
who
fail
to
nobly
act
until
more
earnest
helpers
stepping
in
do
all
the
praise
and
honor
win
the
brownies
at
the
gymnasium

the
brownies
once
while
roaming
by
chance

as
they
skirmished

espied

fare

they
clustered
close

delved
and
ate
without
a
knife
a
spoon

plate
some
picking
out
the
plums

care
and
leaving
all
the
pastry
there
while
some
let
plums
and
currants
go
but
paid
attention
to
the
dough
the
purpose
of
each
brownie
mind
was
not
to
leave
a
crumb
behind
that
when
the
morning
sun
should
shine
through
leafy
tree
and
clinging
vine
no
traces
of
their
sumptuous
feast

it
might
reveal
to
man

well
they
gauged
what
all
could
bear
when
they
their
pudding
did
prepare
for
when
the
rich
repast
was
done
the
rogues
could
neither
fly

run
the
miller
never
missed
his
flour

brownies
wield
a
mystic
power
they
take

can
restore
in
greater
plenty
than
before
the

tobogganing

one
evening
when
the
snow
lay
white
on
level
plain

mountain
height
the
brownies
mustered
one
and
all
in
answer
to
a
special
call
illustration

all
clustered
in
a
ring
they
stood
within
the
shelter
of
the
wood
while
earnest
faces
brighter
grew
at
thought
of
enterprises
new
said
one
it
seems
that
all
the
rage
with
human
kind
of
every
age
is
on
toboggans
swift
to
slide
down
steepest
hill
or
mountain
side
our
plans
at
once
we
must
prepare
and
try
ourselves
that
pleasure
rare
we
might
enough
toboggans
find
in
town
perhaps
of
every
kind
if
some
one
chanced
to
know
where
they
awaiting
sale
are
stowed
away
another
spoke
within
us
lies
the
power
to
make
our
own
supplies
we
not
depend
on
other
hands
to
satisfy
these
new
demands
the
merchants
wares
we
let
alone
and
make
toboggans
of
our
own

some
miles
from
here
holds
seasoned
lumber
all
the
year
there
pine
and
cedar
may
be
found
and
oak
and
ash
are
piled
around
some
boards
are
thick
and
some
are
thin
but
all
will
bend
like
sheets
of
tin
at
once
we
hasten
to
the
spot
and
though
a
fence
surrounds
the
lot
we
skirmish
and
persevere
and
gain
an
entrance
never
fear
illustration

this
brought
a
smile
to
every
face
for
brownies
love
to
climb
and
race
and
undertake
such
work
as
will
bring
into
play
their
wondrous
skill
the
pointers
on
the
dial
plate
could
hardly
mark
a
later
date
before
they
scampered
the
miles
that
brought
them
to
the
lumber
piles
and
then
they
clambered
crept
and
squeezed
and
gained
admittance
where
they
pleased
for
other
ways
than
builders
show
to
scale
a
wall
the
brownies
know
some
sought
for
birch
and
some
for
pine
and
some
for
cedar
soft
and
fine
with
free
selection
well
content
soon
under
heavy
loads
they
bent
it
chanced
to
be
a
windy
night
which
made
their
labor
far
from
light
but
though
a
heavy
tax
was
laid
on
strength
and
patience
undismayed
they
worked
their
way
by
hook
or
crook
and
reached
at
last
a
sheltered
nook
illustration

then
lively
work
the
crowd
began
to
make
toboggans
true
to
plan
the
force
was
large
the
rogues
had
skill
and
hands
were
willing
better
still
so
here
a
twist
and
there
a
bend
soon
brought
their
labors
to
an
end
illustration
without
the
aid
of
steam
or
glue
they
curved
them
like
a
war
canoe
no
little
forethought
some
displayed
but
wisely
made
that
should
they
turn
as
turn
they
might

keep
the
downward
course
aright
they
fashioned
some
for
three
or
four
and
some
to
carry
eight

more

while
some
were
made
to
take
a
crowd
and
room
for
half
the
band
allowed
before
the
middle
watch
of
night
the
brownies
sought
the
mountain
height
and
down
the
steepest
grade
it
showed
the
band
in
wild
procession
rode
some
lay
at
length
some
found
a
seat
some
bravely
stood
on
bracing
feet
but
trouble
as
you
understand
oft
moves
with
pleasure
hand
in
hand
and
even
brownies
were
not
free
from
evil
snag
or
stubborn
tree
that
split
toboggans
like
a
quill
and
scattered
riders
down
the
hill
illustration
with
pitch
and
toss
and
plunge
they
flew
some
skimmed
the
drifts
some
tunneled
through
then
out
across
the
frozen
plain
at
dizzy
speed
they
shot
amain
illustration
through
splintered
rails
and
flying
gates
of
half
a
dozen
large
estates
until
it
seemed
that
ocean
wide
alone
could
check
the
fearful
ride
some
growing
dizzy
with
the
speed
at
times
a
friendly
hand
would
need
to
help
them
keep
their
proper
grip
through
all
the
dangers
of
the
trip
and
thus
until
the
stars
had
waned
the
sport
of
coasting
was
maintained
then
while
they
sought
with
lively
race
in
deeper
woods
a
how
strange

we
never
tried
till

since
we
proved
the
pleasure

we
often
muster
on
the
height

make
the
most

such

every

the
jovial
brownies
gathered
there

with
the
days

came
drenching

made

found

flying
trip
had
given
aeronauts
the
slip

falling
here
in
foliage
green
through
all
the
summer
lay
unseen
the
brownies
gathered
fast
to
stare
upon
the
monster
lying
there

and
when
they
learned
the
use
and
plan
of
valves
and
ropes
the
rogues
began
to
lay
their
schemes
and
name
a
night
when
all
could
take
an
airy
flight
we
want
said
one
no
tame
affair
like
some
that

with
heated
air

hardly
clear

before

high
the
boat
or
basket
must
be
strong
designed
to
take
the
crowd
along
for
that
which
leaves
a

behind
would
hardly
suit
the
brownie
mind

the
works
that
serve
the
town

bray

are
scarce
two
miles
away
night
we
come
and
bear
as
best
we
can
this
burden
there
and
when
inflated
fit
to
rise
we
take
a
sail
around
the
skies
illustration
next
evening
as
the
scheme
was
planned
the
brownies
promptly
were
on
hand
for
when
some
pleasure
lies
in
view
the
absentees
are
always
few
but
was
no
easy
task
to
haul
the
old
balloon
car
ropes
and
all
across
the
rocks
and
fallen
trees
and
through
the
marshes
to
their
knees

brownies
persevering
still
will
keep
their
course
through
every
ill
and
in
the
main
as
history
shows
succeed
in
aught
they
do
propose
illustration
so
though
it
cost
them
rather
dear
in
scratches
there
and
tumbles
here
they
worked
until
the
wondrous
feat
of
transportation
was
complete
then
while
some
busy
fingers
played
around
the
rents
that
branches
made
an
extra
coil
of
rope
was
tied
in
long
festoons
around
the
side
that
all
the
party
young
and
old
might
find
a
trusty
seat
or
hold
and
while
they
worked
they
chatted
free
about
the
wonders
they
would
see
said
one
as
smoothly
as
a
kite
we
rise
above
the
clouds
and
may
the
question
settle
soon
about
the
surface
of
the
moon
now
all
was
ready
for
the
gas
and
soon
the
lank
and
tangled
mass
began
to
flop
about
and
rise
as
though
impatient
for
the
skies
then
was
there
work
for
every
hand
that
could
be
mustered
in
the
band
to
keep
the
growing
monster
low

they
stood
prepared
to
go
to
this

they
made
it
fast

rope
was
cast

strong
it
grew

stronger
still

every
wrinkle
seemed
to
fill
and
when
at
last
it
bounded
clear
and
started
on
its
wild
career
a
rooted
stump

garden
gate
it
carried
off
as
special
freight

all
the
brownies
went
a
part
were
not
in
proper
shape

start
arrangements
hardly
were
complete
some
wanted
room
and
more
a
seat
while
some
in
acrobatic
style
must
put
their
trust
in
toes
awhile
but
brownies
are
not
hard
to
please
and
soon
they
rested
at
their
ease
some
found
support
both
safe
and
strong
upon
the
gate
that
went
along
by
some
the
stump
was
utilized
and
furnished
seats
they
highly
prized
now

they
rose
they
ran
afoul
of
screaming
hawk
and
hooting
owl
and
flitting
bats
that
hooked
their
wings
at
once
around
the
ropes

strings

start

commenced
to
go

lost

check

they
tried

it
seemed
to
rush

some
began

wring
their

were
craning

the
spot

tie
him
in
a
sailor
knot
another
then
was
quick
to
shout
we
leave
that
snake
performance
out
i
grant
you
all
the
power
you
claim
to
charm
to
tie
to
twist
and
tame
but
let
me
still
suggest
you
try
your
art
when
no
one
else
is
nigh
of
all
the
beasts
that
creep
or
crawl
from
rupert
land
to
china
wall
in
torrid
mild
or
frigid
zone
the
snake
is
best
to
let
alone
against
this
counsel
seeming
good
at
least
a
score
of
others
stood
said
one
my
friend
suppress
alarm
there
nothing
here
to
threaten
harm
be
sure
the
power
that
mortals
hold
is
not
denied
the
brownies
bold
illustration
so
harmlessly
as
silken
bands
the
snakes
were
twisted
in
their
hands
some
hauled
them
freely
the
place
some
braided
others
in
a
trace
and
every
knot
to
sailors
known
was
quickly
tied
and
quickly
shown
thus
from
cage
to
cage
they
went
for
some
to
smile
and
some
comment
on
nature
way
of
dealing
out
to
this
a
tail
to
that
a
snout
illustration
of
extra
length
and
then
deny
to
something
else
a
fair
supply
but
when
the
bear
and
tiger
growled
and
wolf
and
lynx
in
chorus
howled
and
starting
from
its
broken
sleep
the
lion
rose
with
sudden
leap
and
bounding
the
rocking
cage
with
lifted
mane
roared
loud
with
rage
and
thrust
its
paws
between
the
bars
until
it
seemed
to
shake
the
stars
illustration
a
panic
seized
the
brownies
all
and
out
they
scampered
from
the
hall
as
if
they
feared
incautious
men
had
built
too
frail
a
prison
pen
the
brownies
circus
one
night
the
circus
was
in
town
with
tumbling
men
and
painted
clown
and
brownies
came
from
forest
deep
around
the
tent
to
climb
and
creep
and
through
the
canvas
as
they
might
of
inner
movements
gain
a
sight
illustration

said
one
a
chance
we
hardly
find
that
better
suits
the
brownie
mind
when
all
this
great
array
of
people
take
their
homeward
way
we
promptly
make
a
swift
descent
and
take
possession
of
the
tent
and
here
till
morning
light
is
shown
we
have
a
circus
of
our
own
i
best
cried
one
of
all
the
band
the
elephant
can
take
in
hand
i
noticed
how
they
led
him
round
and
marked
the
place
he
may
be
found
on
me
you
may
depend
to
keep
the
monster
harmless
as
a
sheep
the
laughing
crowd
that
filled
the
place
had
hardly
homeward
turned
its
face
before
the
eager
waiting
band
took
full
possession
as
they
planned
and
they
scampered
left
and
right

to
see
what
offered
most
delight
cried
one
if
i
can
only
find
the
whip
i
have
a
happy
mind

for
i
be
master
of
the
ring

keep
the
horses
on
the
spring
announce
the
names
of
those
who
ride
and
snap
the
whip
on
every
side
another
said
i
be
a
clown
i
saw
the
way
they
tumble
down
and
how
the
cunning
rogues
contrive
to
always
keep
the
fun
alive
illustration
with
such
remarks
away
they
went
at
this
or
that
around
the
tent
the
wire
that
not
an
hour
before
the
japanese
had
traveled
from
end
to
end
with
careful
stride
was
hunted
up
and
quickly
tried
not
one
alone
upon
it
stepped
but
up
by
twos
and
threes
they
crept
until
the
strand
appeared
to
bear
no
less
than
half
the
brownies
there
some
showed
an
easy
graceful
pose
but
some
put
little
faith
in
toes
and
thought
that
fingers
after
all
are
best
if
one
begins
to
fall
when
weary
of
a
sport
they
grew
away
to
other
tricks
they
flew
they
rode
upon
the
rolling
ball
without
regard
to
slip
or
fall
both
up
and
down
the
steep
incline
they
kept
their
place
with
balance
fine
until
it
bounded
from
the
road
and
whirled
away
without
its
load
they
galloped
the
dusty
ring
without
a
saddle
strap
or
string
and
jumped
through
hoops
both
large
and
small
and
over
banners
poles
and
all
in
time
the
elephant
was
found
and
held
as
though
in
fetters
bound
their
mystic
power
controlled
the
beast
he
seemed
afraid
to
move
the
least
but
filled
with
wonder
limp
and
lax
he
stood
and
trembled
in
his
tracks
while
all
the
band
from
first
to
last
across
his
back
in
order
passed
illustration
illustration
so
thus
they
saw
the
moments
fly
till
dawn
began
to
paint
the
sky
and
then
by
every
flap
and
tear
they
made
their
way
to
open
air
and
off
through
lanes
and
alleys
passed
to
reach
their
at
last
the
brownies
at
illustration
one
evening
from
a
shaded
spot
the
brownies
viewed
a
level
lot
where
clubs
from
different
cities
came
to
play
the
nation
favorite
game
then
spoke
a
member
of
the
band
illustration
illustration
this
game
extends
throughout
the
land
no
city

village
but
has
its
club
and
diamond
ground
with
bases
marked
and
paths
between
and
seats

scene

take
our
turn
at
ball

prove
ourselves
expert

another
answered
i
have
planned
a
method
to
equip
our
band
there
is
a
firm
in
yonder
town
whose
goods
have
won
them
wide
renown
their
special
branch
of
business
lies
in
sending
forth
these

quite
enough
for

when
hungry
bats
came
forth
to
wheel
eaves
and
find
their
evening
meal
the
cunning
brownies
sought
the
store
to
work
their
way
through
sash
and
door
and
soon
their
beaming
faces
told
success
had
crowned
their
efforts
bold
a
goodly
number
of
the
throng
took
extra
implements
along
illustration
in
case
of
mishap
on
the
way
or
loss
or
breakage
during
play
the
night
was
clear
the
road
was
good
and
soon
within
the
field
they
stood
then
games
were
played
without
a
pause
according
to
the

a
fly

soon
every
corner
of
the
ground
its
separate
set
of
players
found
a
dozen
games
upon
the
green
with
ins

outs
might
there
be
seen
the
umpires
noting
all
with
care
to
tell
if
hits
were
foul

the
strikes

balls

plainly
shout
and
say
if
men
were
safe
or
out
and
give
decision
just
and
wise
when
knotty
questions
would
arise
illustration
but
many
brownies
thought
it
best
to
leave
the
sport
and
watch
the
rest
and
from
the
seats
or
fences
high
they
viewed
the
scene
with
anxious
eye
and
never
failed
the
contest
through
to
render
praise
when
praise
was
due
illustration
while
others
freed
from
games
on
hand
in
merry
groups
aside
would
stand
and
pitch
and
catch
with
rarest
skill
to
keep
themselves
in
practice
still
illustration
now
double
plays
and
balls
well
curved

base
hits
often
were
observed
while
errors
were
but
seldom
seen
through
all
the
games
upon
that
green
before
the
flush
of
morn
arose
to
bring
their
contests
to
a
close
the
balls
and
bats
in
every
case
were
carried
back
and
put
in
place
and
when
the
brownies
left
the
store
all
was
in
order
as
before
the
brownies
and
the
bees
illustration
while
brownies
once
were
rambling
through
a
forest
where
tall
timber
grew
the
hum
of
bees
above
their
head
to
much
remark

wonder
led
they
gazed
at
branches
in
the
air

listened
at
the
roots

care

soon
a
pine

giant

was
found
to
hold
the
hidden
prize
said
one
some
wild
bees
here
have
made
their
home
within
the
forest

neither
fox

prying
bear
can
steal
the
treasure
gathered
there
another
spoke
you
quick

as

rule
judge
matters
right
but
here
my
friend
you
all
astray
and
like
the
blind
mole
grope
your
way
i
chance
well
to
remember
still
how
months
ago
when
up
the
hill
a
farmer
near
with
bell
and
horn
pursued
a
swarm
one
sunny
morn
the
fearful
din
the
town
awoke
the
clapper
from
his
bell
he
broke
but
still
their
queen
directing
cry
illustration
the
bees
heard
the
clamor
high
and
held
their
bearing
for
this
pine
as
straight
as
runs
the
county
line
with
taxes
here
and
failures
there
the
man
can
ill
such
losses
bear
in
view
of
this
our
duty
clear
night
we
muster
here
and
when
we
give
this
tree
a
fall
in
proper
shape
we
hive
them
all
and
take
the
queen
and
working
throng
and
lazy
drones
where
they
belong
next
evening
at
the
time
they
set
around
the
pine
the
brownies
met
with
tools
collected
as
they
sped
from
mill
and
shop
and
farmer
shed
while
some
to
all
their
wants
alive
with
ready
hands
procured
a
hive
ere
work
began
said
one
i
fear
but
little
sport
awaits
us
here
be
sure
a
trying
task
we
find
the
bee
is
fuss

fire
combined

take
him
in
his
drowsy
hour

when
palavering

the
flower

wild

those
will
rue
it
who
neglect
to
treat
the
buzzer
with
respect
illustration
ere
long
by
steady
grasp
and
blow
the
towering
tree
was
leveled
low
and
then
the
hive
was
made
to
rest
in
proper
style
above
the
nest
until
the
queen
and
all
her
train
did
full
and
fair
possession
gain
illustration

then
the
hive
a
sheet
was
tied

some
were
thoughtful
to
provide

off
on
poles

best
they
could
they
bore
the
burden
from
the
wood

trouble

may
divine
occurred
at
points
along

line
was
bad
enough

when
the
brownies
lacked
a
road

climbed
the
fences
with
their
load
then
numbers
of
the
prisoners
there
came
trooping
out
to
take
the
air

managed

to
fly

keep
excitement

when
at

the

they
found

girt
the

laid
the

stand

hardly
was
in

was

from

thoughts

roller

kept
ahead
said
one
when
deeper
shadows
fall
we
cross
the
river
find
the
hall

learn
the
nature
of
the
sport
of
which
we
hear
such
good
report
to
reach
the
bridge
that
led
to
town
with
eager
steps
they
hastened
down

recent
rains
had
caused
a
rise
the
stream
was
now
a
fearful
size
the
bridge
was
nearly
swept
away
submerged
in
parts

wet
with
spray

when
the
cunning

get
their
mind
on
some
maneuver

nor
wind

flood

frost

fire
can
ever
make
the
rogues
retire
some
walked
the
dripping
logs

ease

crept
on
hands
and
knees
with
movements
rather
safe
than
fast

inch

the
danger
passed

now
guided
by
the
rumbling
sound
that
told
where
skaters
circled
through
dimly
lighted
streets
they
flew

close

building
drew
without

the
active
band

spouts

other
means
at

skill

gained

through

crown
it

are
in

already
laid
within

the
folk
below
will
quit
their
sport

homeward
go

then
will
the
time
be
ripe
indeed
for
us
to
leave
this
roof
with
speed
and
prove
how
well
our
toes
and
heels
we
may
command
when
set
on
wheels
when
came
the
closing
hour
at
last
and
people
from
the
rink
had
passed
the
brownies
hurried
down
to
find
the
roller
skates
they
left
behind

such
a
scene
was
there

may
ever
have
a
chance
to
view
some
hardly
circled
the
place
before
they
moved
with
ease
and
grace
and
skated
freely
to
and
fro
upon
a
single
heel
or
toe
some
coats
were
torn
beyond
repair
by
catches
here
and
clutches
there
when
those
who
felt
their
faith
give
way
groped
right
and
left
without
delay
illustration
while
some
who
strove
their
friends
to
aid
upon
the
floor
themselves
were
laid
to
spread
confusion
there
awhile
as
large
and
larger
grew
the
pile
illustration
some
rose
with
fingers
out
of
joint
or
black
and
blue
at
every
point
illustration
and
few
but
felt
some
portion
sore
from
introductions
to
the
floor

such
mishaps
were
lost
to
sight
amid
the
common
wild
delight
for
little
plaint
do
brownies
make
bump
or
bruise
or
even
break

stars
at
length
began
to
wane
and
dawn
came
creeping
through
the
pane
and
much
against
the
will
of
all
the
rogues
were
forced
to
leave
the
hall
the
brownies
at
the
seaside
illustration
within
a
forest
dark
and
wide
some
distance
from
the
ocean
side
a
band
of
brownies
played
around
on
mossy
stone

grassy
mound

climbing
through

branching
tree
performed
their
antics
wild
and
free
illustration
when
one
arising
in
his
place
with
sparkling
eyes
and
beaming
face
soon
won
attention
from
the
rest
and
thus
the
listening
throng
addressed
for
years
and
years
through
heat
and
cold
our
home
has
been
this
forest
old
the
saplings
which
we
used
to
bend
now
like

ascend

here
we
live
content
to
ride
a
springing
bough

childish
pride
content
to
bathe
in
brook

lizard

modern
youths
no

lave
their

seek
the
ocean
far
beyond
if
pleasure
in
the
sea
is
found
not
offered

band
at

should
haste

these

evening

laid

gathered

clustered

darted
from

straight
across

began
their
journey

the
tide
and
when
they
neared
the
beach
at
last
the
stout
the
lean
the
slow
the
fast
was
hard
to
say
of
all
the
lot
who
foremost
reached
the
famous
spot
and
now
said
one
with
active
mind
what
proper
garments
can
we
find
in
bathing
costume
as
you
know
the
people
in
the
ocean
go
another
spoke
for
such
demands
the
building
large
that
yonder
stands
illustration
as
one
can
see
on
passing
by
is
full
of
garments
clean
and
dry
there
every
fashion
loose
or
tight
we
may
secure
with
labor
light
though
brownies
never
carry
keys
they
find
an
entrance
where
they
please
and
never
do
they
chuckle
more
than
when
some
miser
bars
his
door
for
well
they
know
that
spite
of
locks
of
rings
and
staples
bolts
and
blocks
were
they
inclined
to
play
such
prank
he
find
at
morn
an
empty
bank
so
now
the
crafty
brownie
crew
soon
brought
the
to
view
some
working
on
the
inner
side
the
waiting
throng
without
illustration
was
busy
work
as
may
be
guessed
before
the
band
was
fully
dressed
some
still
had
cloth
enough
to
lend
though
shortened
up
at
either
end
sortie
ran
about
to
find
a
pin
while
others
rolled
and
puckered
in
illustration
and
made
the
best
of
what
they
found
however
strange
it
hung
around
then
when
a
boat
was
manned
with
care
to
watch
for
daring
swimmers
there
illustration
lest
some
should
venture
and
fall
a
prey
to
cramp
and
cold
a
few
began
from
piers
to
leap
and
plunge
at
once
in
water
deep
but
more
to
shiver
shrink
and
shout
as
step
by
step
they
ventured
out
while
others
were
content
to
stay
in
shallow
surf
to
duck
and
play
along
the
lines
that
people
laid
to
give
the
weak
and
timid
aid
it
was
a
sight
one
should
behold
when
the
crowd
the
breakers
rolled
one
took
a
header
through
the
wave
one
floated
like
a
chip
or
stave
while
others
there
at
every
plunge
were
taking
water
like
a
sponge
illustration
illustration
but
while
the
surf
they
tumbled
through
they
reckoned
moments
as
they
flew
and
kept
in
mind
their
homeward
race
before
the
sun
should
show
his
face
illustration
for
sad
and
painful
is
the
fate
of
those
who
roam
abroad
too
late
and
well
may
brownies
bear
in
mind
the
hills
and
vales
they
leave
behind
when
far
from
native
haunts
they
run
as
oft
they
do
in
quest
of
fun
but
ere
they
turned
to
leave
the
strand
they
made
a
vow
with
lifted
hand
that
every
year
when
summer
glow
had
warmed
the
ocean
spread
below
they
journey
far
from
grove
and
glen
to
sport
in
rolling
surf
again
illustration
the
brownies
and
the
illustration
one
evening
with
the
falling
dew
some
brownies
a
cottage
drew
said
one
i
learned
the
reason
why
we
miss
the
biddy
cry
that
every
morning
brought
a
score
of
fowls
around
this
cottage
door
is
rheumatism
most
severe
that
keeps
the
widow
prisoned
here
her
sheep
go
bleating
through
the
field
in
quest
of
salt
no
herb
can
yield
to
early
roost
the
fowls
withdraw
while
each
bewails
an
empty
craw
and
sore
neglect
you
may
discern
on
every
side
you
turn
if
aid
come
to
the
widow
need
from
brownies
hands
it
must
proceed
another
said
the
wool
i
know
went
through
the
mill
a
month
ago
i
saw
them
when
they
bore
the
sack
tip
yonder
hill
a
wondrous
pack
that
caught
the
branches
overhead
and
round
their
heels
the
gravel
spread
her
is
lying
there
in
fragments
quite
beyond
repair
a
passing
goat
with
manners
bold
mistook
it
for
a
rival
old
illustration
illustration
and
knocked
it
for
half
an
hour
with
all
his
noted
butting
power
they
say
it
was
a
striking
scene
that
twilight
conflict
on
the
green
the
wheel
was
resting
on
the
shed
the
frame
around
the
garden
spread
before
the
goat
had
gained
his
sight
and
judged
the
article
aright
illustration
a
third
remarked
i
call
to
mind
another
wheel
that
we
may
find
though
somewhat
worn
by
use
and
time
it
seems
to
be
in
order
prime
now
night
is
but
a
babe
as
yet
the
dew
has
scarce
the
clover
wet
by
running
fast
and
working
hard
we
soon
can
bring
it
to
the
yard
then
stationed
here
in
open
air
the
widow
wool
shall
be
our
care
this
suited
all
and
soon
with
zeal
they
started
off
to
find
the
wheel
their
course
across
the
country
lay
where
great
obstructions
barred
the
way
but
brownies
seldom
go
around
however
rough
or
wild
the
ground
rocky
slope

marshy
bed
with
one
accord
they
pushed
ahead
across
the
of
a
mill
and
through
a
churchyard
on
the
hill
they
found
the
wheel
with
head
and
feet
and
band
and
fixtures
all
complete
illustration
and
soon
beneath
the
trying
load
were
struggling
on
the
homeward
road
they
had
some
trouble
toil
and
care
some
hoisting
here
and
hauling
there
illustration
at
times
the
wheel
upon
a
fence
defied
them
all
to
drag
it
thence
as
though
determined
to
remain
and
serve
the
farmer
guarding
grain
but
patient
head
and
willing
hand
can
wonders
work
in
every
land
and
cunning
brownies
never
yield
but
aye
as
victors
leave
the
field
some
ran
for
sticks
and
some
for
pries
and
more
for
blocks
on
which
to
rise
that
every
hand
or
shoulder
there
in
such
a
pinch
might
do
its
share
before
the
door
they
set
the
wheel
and
near
at
hand
the
winding
reel
that
some
might
wind
while
others
spun
and
thus
the
task
be
quickly
done
no
time
was
wasted
now
to
find
what
best
would
suit
each
hand
or
mind
some
through
the
cottage
crept
about
to
find
the
wool
and
pass
it
out
with
some
to
turn
and
some
to
pull
and
some
to
shout
the
spindle
full
the
wheel
gave
out
a
droning

the
work

pushed
along

their
mode

action

their
skill
with
wonder
might
a
spinster
fill
for
out
across
the
yard
entire
they
spun
the
yarn
like
endless
wire
beyond
the
well
with
steady
haul
across
the
patch
of
beans
and
all
until
the
walls
or
ditches
wide
a
greater
stretch
of
wool
denied
the
widow
yarn
was
quickly
wound
in
tidy
balls
quite

round

and
ere
the
night
began
to
fade
the
borrowed

at

was
laid

none
the
worse
for

voyage

one
night
a
restless
brownie
band
resolved
to
leave
their
native
strand
and
visit
islands
fair
and
green
that
in
the
distance
might
be
seen
in
answer
to
a
summons
wide
the
brownies
came
from
every
side
a
novel
spectacle
they
made
all
mustered
in
the
forest
shade
with
working
implements
they
came
of
every
fashion
use
and
name
said
one
how
many
times
have
we
surveyed
those
islands
in
the
sea
and
longed
for
means
to
thither
sail
and
ramble
over
hill
and
vale
illustration
that
pleasure
rare
we
may
command
without
the
aid
of
human
hand
and
ere
the
faintest
streak
of
gray
has
advertised
the
coming
day
a
sturdy
craft
both
tough
and
tall
with
masts
and
halyards
shrouds
and
all
with
sails
to
spread
and
helm
to
guide
completed
from
the
ways
shall
glide
so
exercise
your
mystic
power
and
make
the
most
of
every
hour
with
axes
hammers
saws
and
rules
dividers
squares
and
boring
tools
the
active
brownies
scattered
and
every
one
his
labor
found
some
fell
to
chopping
down
the
trees
and
some
to
hewing
ribs
and
knees
while
more
the
ponderous
keelson
made
and
fast
the
shapely
hull
was
laid
then
over
all
they
clambered
soon
like
bees
around
their
hive
in
june
was
hammer

here
and
there
and
rip
and

everywhere
illustration

while
some
were
spiking
planks
and
beams
the
calkers
stuffed
the
yawning
seams
and
poured
the
resin
left
and
right
to
make
her
stanch
and
some
busily
were
bringing
nails
and
bolts
of
canvas
for
the
sails
and
coils
of
rope
of
every
size
to
make
the
ratlines

guys
it
mattered
little
whence
it
came
or
who
a
loss
of
stock
might
claim
supply
kept
even
with
demand
convenient
to
the
rigger
hand
was
marvelous
to
see
how
fast
the
vessel
was
together
cast
until
with
all
its
rigs
and
stays
it
sat
prepared
to
leave
the
ways
it
but
remained
to
name
it
now
and
break
a
bottle
on
the
bow
to
knock
the
wedges
from
the
side
and
from
the
keel
and
let
it
slide
illustration
and
when
it
rode
upon
the
sea
the
brownies
thronged
the
deck
with
glee
and
veering
in
proper
style
they
bore
away
for
nearest
isle
illustration
but
those
who
will
the
ocean
brave
should
be
prepared
for
wind
and
wave
for
storms
will
rise
as
many
know
when
least
we
look
for
squall
or
blow
and
soon
the
sky
was
overcast
and
waves
were
running
high
and
fast
illustration
then
some
were
sick
and
some
were
filled
with
fears
that
all
their
ardor
chilled
but
as
when
dangers
do
assail
the
humankind
though
some
may
quail
there
will
be
found
a
few
to
face
the
danger
and
redeem
the
race
illustration
so
some
brave
brownies
nobly
stood
and
manned
the
ship
as
best
they
could
some
staid
on
deck
to
sound
for
bars
some
went
aloft
to
watch
for
stars
and
some
around
the
rudder
hung
and
here
and
there
the
vessel
swung
while
others
strung
on
yard
and
mast
kept
shifting
sails
to
suit
the
blast
at
times
the
bow
was
high
in
air
and
next
the
stern
was
lifted
there
illustration
so
thus
it
tumbled
tossed
and
rolled
and
shipped
enough
to
fill
the
hold
till
more
than
once
it
seemed
as
though
to
feed
the
fish
they
all
must
go
illustration
but
still
they
bravely
tacked
and
veered
and
hauled
and
reefed
and
onward
steered
while
screaming
birds
around
them
wheeled
as
if
to
say
your
doom
is
sealed
and
hungry
gar
and
hopeful
shark
in
shoals
pursued
the
creaking
bark
still
wondering
how
it
braved
a
gale
that
might
have
made
columbus
pale
the
rugged
island
near
them
now
was
looming
on
their
starboard
bow
but
knowing
not
the
proper
way
of
entering
its
sheltered
bay
they
simply
kept
their
canvas
spread
and
steered
the
vessel
straight
ahead
the
birds
were
distanced
in
the
race
the
gar
and
shark
gave
up
the
chase
and
turning
back
forsook
the
keel
and
lost
their
chances
of
a
meal
for
now
the
ship
to
ruin
flew
as
though
it
felt
its
work
was
through
and
soon
it
stranded
pitch
and
toss
upon
the
rocks
a
total
loss
the
masts
and
spars
went
by
the
board
the
hull
was
shivered
like
a
gourd
but
yet
on
broken
plank
and
rail
on
splintered
spars
and
bits
of
sail
that
strewed
for
miles
the
rugged
strand
the
brownies
safely
reached
the
land
illustration
now
brownies
lack
the
power
is
said
of
making
twice
what
once
they
made
so
all
their
efforts
were
in
vain
to
build
and
launch
the
ship
again
and
on
that
island
roaming
that
brownie
band
for
years
was
found
the
brownies
return
once
while
the
brownies
lay
at
ease
about
the
roots
of
rugged
trees
and
listened
to
the
dreary
moan
of
tides
around
their
island
lone
said
one
my
friends
unhappy
here
we
spend
our
days
from
year
to
year
we
cornered
in
and
hardly
boast
a
run
of
twenty
leagues
at
most
you
all
remember
well
i
ween
the
night
we
reached
this
island
green
when
flocks
of
fowl
around
us
wailed
and
followed
till
their
pinions
failed
and
still
our
ship
at
every
wave
to
sharks
a
creaking
promise
gave
then
spilled
us
out
in
breakers
white
to
gain
the
land
as
best
we
might
since
then
how
oft
we
tried
in
vain
to
reach
our
native
haunts
again
where
roaming
freely
unconfined
would
better
suit
our
roving
mind
while
wandering
by
the
sea
a
novel
scheme
occurred
to
me
as
i
beheld
in
groups
and
rows
the
weary
fowl
in
deep
repose
they
sat
as
motionless
as
though
the
life
had
left
them
years
ago
the
albatross
and
crane
are
there
the
loon
the
gull
and
gannet
rare
an
easy
task
for
us
to
creep
around
the
fowl
while
fast
asleep
and
at
a
given
signal
spring
aboard
before
they
spread
a
wing
and
trust
to
them
to
bear
us
in
safety
to
our
native
shore
another
spoke
i
never
yet
have
shunned
a
risk
that
others
met
but
here
uncommon
dangers
lie
suppose
the
fowl
should
seaward
fly
and
never
landing
course
about
and
drop
us
when
their
wings
gave
out
to
shallow
schemes
that
will
not
bring
a
modest
risk
let
cowards
cling
the
first
replied
a
brownie
shows
the
best
where
dangers
thickest
close
but
hear
me
out
by
sea
and
land
their
habits
well
i
understand
when
rising
first
they
circle
wide
as
though
the
strength
of
wings
they
tried
then
steering
straight
across
the
bay
to
yonder
coast
a
visit
pay
but
granting
they
for
once
should
be
inclined
to
strike
for
open
sea
the
breeze
that
now
is
rising
fast
will
freshen
to
a
whistling
blast
and
landward
sweeping
stronger
still
will
drive
the
fowl
against
their
will
illustration
now
at
his
heels
with
willing
feet
they
followed
to
the
fowls
retreat
was
hard
to
scale
the
rugged
breast
of
crags
where
birds
took
nightly
rest
but
some
on
hands
and
some
on
knees
and
more
by
vines
or
roots
of
trees
from
shelf
to
shelf
untiring
strained
and
soon
the
windy
summit
gained
with
bated
breath
they
gathered
round

crawled

along
the

this

that
one

each
chose
the
bird
he
wished
to
ride
illustration
when
all
had
done
the
best
they
could
and
waiting
for
the
signal
stood
it
hardly
took
a
moment
space
for
each
to
scramble
to
his
place
illustration
some
seized
a
neck
and
some
a
head
and
some
a
wing
and
some
a
shred
of
tail
or
aught
that
nearest
lay
to
help
them
mount
without
delay
then
rose
wild
flaps
and
piercing
screams
as
sudden
starting
from
their
dreams
the
wondering
fowl
in
sore
dismay
brought
wings
and
muscles
into
play
some
felt
the
need
of
longer
sleep
and
hardly
had
the
strength
to
cheep
while
others
seemed
to
find
a
store
of
screams
they
never
found
before
but
off
like
leaves
or
flakes
of
snow
before
the
gale
the
brownies
go
away
away
through
spray

oddly
balanced
load

they
flew
the
sport

every
blast
while
fish
below
had
aching
eyes
with
gazing
upward
at
the
prize
they
followed
still
from
mile
to
mile
believing
fortune
yet
would
smile
while
plainer
to
the
brownies
grew
the
hills
and
vales
that
well
they
knew
i

said
one
who
from
his
post
between
the
wings
could
view
the
coast
the
lofty
peaks
we
used
to
climb

gaze
upon
the
scene

a
second
cried
and
there
the
bay
from
which
our
vessel
bore
away
and
i
another
cried
can
see
the
shady
grove
the
very
tree
we
met
beneath
the
night
we
planned
to
build
a
ship
and
leave
the
land
all
in
confusion
now
at
last
the
birds
upon
the
shore
were
cast
some
tumbling
through
thick
branches
fell
and
spilled
the
load
that
clung
so
well
some
to
the
ground
dispersed
their
riders
all
around
and
others
still
could
barely
get
to
shores
where
land
and
water
met
congratulations
then
began
as
here
and
there
the
brownies
ran
illustration
to
learn
if
all
had
held
their
grip
and
kept
aboard
throughout
the
trip

now

a
comrade
drew
an
interesting
tale
to
hear
about
a
village
lying
near
last
night
said
he
i
heard
arise
from
many
throats
discordant
cries
at
once
i
followed
up
the
sound
and
soon
to
my
amazement
found
it
issued
from
a
building
small
that
answered
for
the
county
hall
i
listened
there
around
the
door
by
village
time
an
hour
or
more
until
i
learned
beyond
a
doubt
a
caused
all
the
rout
some
like
the
hound
would
keep
ahead
and
others
seemed
to
lag
instead
some
singers
struggling
with
the
tune
outscreamed
the
frightened
northern
loon
some
mocked
the
pinched
or
wheezing
cry
of
locusts
when
the
wheat
is
nigh
while
grumbling
bassos
shamed
the
strain
of
calling
down
the
rain
the
brownies
labor
heart
and
hand
all
mysteries
to
understand
and
if
you
think
those
brownies
bold
received
the
news
so
plainly
told
and
thought
no
more
about
the
place
you
not
familiar
with
the
race
illustration
when
scholars
next
their
voices
tried
the
brownies
came
from
every
side
with
ears
to
in
the
wall
to
thresholds
blinds
and
all
they
listened
to
the
jarring
din
proceeding
from
the
room
within
illustration
said
one
at
length
it
seems
to
me
the
master
here
will
earn
his
fee
if
he
from
such
a
crowd
can
bring
a
single
person
trained
to
sing
another

we
let
them
try
their
voices

their
throats
are
dry

when
for
home
they
all
depart
we
not
be
slow
to
test
our
art

night
the
brownies
cheered
to
find
the
music
had
been
left
behind

when
they
stood
within
the
hall

were

hinting

a

kind

bright
in
which
they
all
could

unite

times
some
member
tried
to
rule

took
control
of
all
the
school

soon
despairing
was
content

let
them
follow
out

sung
both
high
and
low

spread
along

coast
her
streaks

drove

from

undertake

homeward
race

many
members

band
still
kept
their
in

determined
not
with
those
to
part
till
they
were
perfect
in
the
art

oft
in
leafy
forest

in
after
times
a
ring
they
made
to
pitch
the
tune

raise
the
voice

sing
the
verses

their
choice
and
scare
from
branches
overhead

with
ease
be
found
a
place
where
had
spread

left
the
timber
scorched
and
dead

there
throughout

chilly
night
they
tugged
and
tore
with
all

some
bearing
branches
as
their

strode

removed

go
like

their

found
it

it
proved

case

thus
in

the
task
was
carried
forward
still
some
were
by
nature
well
designed

this

never
felt
so
truly
great
as
when
half
crushed
beneath

aghast

were
slight

could
bear
the

that
proved
their
share

at

they
far
beyond

ran
around

staid
to
pile
the
gathered
wood
in

ever
harder

they
found
as
high

rose

it
grew

next
the
cornice
hid
from

ere
the
dawn
had
forced
a
stop
the

some
hands
were
sore

backs

legs
were
scraped

left
their

morning

against

pressed

touched

asked
a
blessing

through

entertain
the
thought
no

study
up
the
brownie

rummaged
boxes
piled
around

themselves
to
what

blazes
out

in

gave
notice
of
the
midnight
hour
the
ruddy
flame
the
turning

the
showering

deafening
peal

ere

gone
to
light
the
summer

some
plasters
would
have
served
the

much
better
than
the
goods

there
were
cases
all
about
where
brownies
thought
the
fuse
was
out
till
with
a
sudden
fizz
and
flare
it
caught
the
jokers
unaware
at
times
in
spite
of
warning
cries
some
proved
too
slow
at
closing

some
ears
were
stunned
some
noses
got
too
close

something
quick

hot

fingers
bore
for
days

the
trace
of
hasty
powder
freaks
some
dodging
would
get
a
share
of
splendor
meant
for
upper

speckled
face
they
ran
about
from
place

find
new

blaze
and
burn

every
side
they
turn

few
were
there

felt
afraid

bursting
bomb

fusillade

to
the
prize
they
stick
and
hang
until
it
vanished

in

easy
vein
express
themselves

a
