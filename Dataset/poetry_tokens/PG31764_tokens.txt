the
dearness
of
her
is
the
thirty
perfect
days
of
june
made
one
in
beauty
and
in
bliss
were
not
more
white
to
have
to
kiss
to
love
not
more
in
tune
and
oft
i
think
she
is
too
true
too
innocent
for
our
day
for
in
her
eyes
her
soul
looks
new
two
are
not
more
soft
than
they
so
good
so
kind
is
she
to
me
in
darling
ways
and
happy
words
sometimes
my
heart
fears
she
may
be
too
much
with
god
and
secretly
sweet
sister
to
the
birds
the
owls
are
quavering
two
now
three
and
all
the
green
is
graying
the
owls
our
trysting
dials
be
there
is
no
time
for
staying
i
wait
you
where
this
buckeye
throws
its
tumbled
shadow
over
and
the
long
and
clover
sassafras
weighs
deep
rough
rail
and
broken
paling
where
all
day
long
the
lizards
sleep
like
lichen
on
the
railing
behind
you
you
will
feel
the
gold
stealing
like
young
laughter
and
mists
gray
ghosts
of
picaroons
its
phantom
treasure
after
and
here
together
youth
and
youth
love
will
be
doubly
able
each
be
to
each
as
true
as
truth
and
dear
as
fairy
fable
the
owls
are
calling
and
the
maize
with
fallen
dew
is
dripping
ah
girlhood
through
the
dewy
haze
come
like
a
moonbeam
slipping
there
is
a
fading
inward
of
the
day
and
all
the
pansy
sunset
hugs
one
star
to
eastward
dwindling
all
the
land
is
gray
while
barley
meadows
westward
smoulder
far
now
to
your
glass
will
you
pass
for
the
last
time
pass
humming
that
ballad
we
know
here
while
i
wait
it
is
late
and
is
past
time
late
and
love
hours
they
go
they
go
there
is
a
drawing
downward
of
the
night
the
wedded
heaven
wends
married
to
the
moon
above
the
heights
hang
golden
in
her
light
below
the
woods
bathe
dewy
in
the
june
there
through
the
dew
is
it
you
coming
lawny
you
or
a
moth
in
the
vines
you
at
your
throat
i
may
note
twinkling
tawny
note
a
your
brooch
that
shines
how
many
smiles
in
the
asking
herein
i
can
not
deceive
you
my
yes
in
a
no
was
nor
thought
dear
once
to
grieve
you
i
hid
the
happiness
here
danced
up
i
the
blood
but
what
are
words
when
the
speech
of
two
souls
all
truth
affords
affirmative
negative
what
in
love
ear
i
wished
to
say
yes
and
somehow
said
no
the
woman
within
me
knew
you
would
know
for
it
held
you
six
times
dear
so
many
hopes
in
a
wooing
therein
you
could
not
deceive
me
the
heart
was
here
and
the
hope
pursuing
knew
that
you
loved
believe
bunched
bells
o
the
blush
pomegranate
to
fix
at
your
throat
three
drops
of
fire
they
are
and
the
maiden
moon
and
the
maiden
star
sink
silvery
over
yon
meadow
ricks
will
you
look
till
i
hug
your
head
back
so
for
i
know
it
is
yes
though
you
whisper
no
and
my
kisses
sweet
are
six
could
i
recall
every
joy
that
befell
me
there
in
the
past
with
its
anguish
and
bliss
here
in
my
heart
it
has
whispered
to
tell
me
these
were
no
joys
to
this
were
it
not
well
if
our
love
could
forget
them
veiling
the
with
the
dawn
of
the
dead
with
the
past
we
should
never
regret
them
these
were
no
joys
to
this
when
they
were
gone
and
the
present
stood
speechful
ardent
with
word
and
with
look
and
with
kiss
what
though
we
know
that
their
eyes
are
beseechful
these
were
no
joys
to
this
is
it
not
well
to
have
more
of
the
spirit
living
high
futures
this
earthly
must
miss
less
of
the
flesh
with
the
past
pining
near
it
such
is
the
joy
of
this
we
will
leave
reason
dear
for
a
season
reason
were
treason
since
yonder
nether
are
clad
now
in
nothing
sad
now
we
will
be
glad
now
glad
as
this
weather
heart
and
heart
in
the
maytime
maytime
youth
and
love
take
playtime
playtime
i
in
the
dairy
you
are
the
airy
majesty
passing
love
is
the
fairy
bringing
us
two
together
starlight
in
masses
of
mist
that
passes
stars
in
the
grasses
and
flower
laughingly
know
us
secretly
show
us
earth
is
below
us
and
for
the
hour
soul
has
soul
in
the
maytime
maytime
youth
and
love
take
playtime
playtime
you
are
a
song
a
singer
i
hear
it
whispered
in
star
and
in
flower
the
spirit
love
is
the
power
and
say
we
can
not
wed
us
now
since
roses
and
the
june
are
here
meseems
beneath
the
beechen
bough
is
just
as
sweet
my
doubly
dear
to
swear
anew
each
old
love
vow
and
love
another
year
when
breathe
green
woodlands
through
and
through
wild
scents
of
heliotrope
and
rain
where
deep
the
moss
mounds
cool
with
dew
beyond
the
lane
more
wise
than
wedding
is
to
woo
so
we
will
woo
again
all
night
i
lie
awake
and
mark
the
hours
by
no
clanging
clock
but
in
the
dim
and
dewy
dark
far
crowing
of
some
punctual
cock
until
the
lyric
of
the
lark
mounts
and
morn
gates
unlock
and
would
you
be
a
nun
and
miss
all
this
delightful
ache
of
love
not
have
the
moon
for
what
she
is
love
god
holds
above
no
world
for
worlds
are
in
a
kiss
if
worlds
are
good
enough
so
say
we
can
not
wed
us
now
since
roses
and
the
june
are
here
we
stroll
beneath
the
doddered
bough
heaven
mated
songsters
singing
near
to
swear
anew
each
old
love
vow
and
love
another
year
opens
his
and
had
we
lived
in
the
days
of
the
khalif
haroun
er
reshid
we
had
loved
as
the
story
says
did
the
sultan
favorite
one
and
the
persian
emperor
son
ali
ben
bekkar
he
of
the
kisra
dynasty
do
you
know
the
story
well
of
the
khalif
haroun
sultana
when
night
on
the
palace
fell
a
slave
through
a
secret
door
on
the
tigris
shore
by
a
hidden
winding
stair
ben
bekkar
brought
to
his
fair
then
there
was
laughter
and
mirth
and
feasting
and
singing
together
in
a
chamber
of
marvellous
worth
in
a
chamber
vaulted
high
on
columns
of
ivory
its
dome
like
the
irised
skies
mooned
over
with
peacock
eyes
and
the
curtains
and
furniture
damask
and
juniper
ten
so
many
blooms
stand
sconcing
tamarisk
torches
from
the
irak
looms
ten
handmaidens
serve
the
feast
each
like
to
a
star
in
the
east
ten
singers
their
lutes
each
like
to
a
bosomed
moon
for
her
in
the
stuff
of
merv
unveiled
and
jewelled
no
metaphor
made
may
serve
scarved
deep
with
her
own
dark
hair
the
jewels
like
there
blossom
and
moon
and
star
the
lady

the
zone
embracing
her
waist
the
ransom
of
forty
princes
but
her
form
more
priceless
is
placed
carbuncles
of
istakhar
in
her
coronet
burning
are
though
gems
of
the
jamshid
race
far
rarer
the
gem
of
her
face
like
the
letter
i
with
a
face
like
an
orient
morning
eyes
of
the
sky
lips
of
the
pomegranate
split
with
the
light
of
her
language
lit
cheeks
which
the
young
blood
dares
make
anemone
lairs
kohled
with
voluptuous
look
from
opaline
handmaidens
over
them
shook
and
strewed
with
bloom
mosaics

the
bronzen

scents
of
ambergris

never
had
parted
no
as
parted
those
lovers
fearful
but
kissing
you
so
and
so
when
they
came
they
had
found
us
dead
on
the
flowers
our
blood
dyed
red
our
lips
together
and
the
dagger
in
my
hand
speaks
o
cities
built
by
music
lyres
of
love
strung
to
a
songful
sea
did
i
but
own
one
harp
chord
of
one
broken
barbiton
what
had
i
budded
for
our
life
thereof
in
docile
shadows
under
bluebell
skies
a
home
upon
the
poppied
edge
of
eve
beneath
lone
peaks
the
splendors
never
leave
in
lemon
orchards
whence
the
egret
flies
where
pitying
gray
the
pitiless
eyes
of
death
blight
no
slight
bud
unfostered
i
have
thought
deep
daturas
fraught
with
dewy
fragrance
like
an
angel
breath
sleep
in
the
days
the
twilights
tuned
and
tame
through
mockbirds
throating
to
attentive
stars
each
morn
outrivalling
each
in
opal
bars
eves
preaching
beauty
with
of
flame
o
country
by
the
undiscovered
sea
the
dream
infolds
thee
and
the
way
is
dim
with
head
not
high
what
if
i
follow
him
love
with
the
madness
and
the
melody
after
a
pause
an
elf
there
is
who
stables
the
hot
red
wasp
that
stings
o
the
apricot
an
elf
who
rowels
his
spiteful
bay
like
a
mote
on
a
ray
away
away
an
elf
who
saddles
the
hornet
lean
to
din
i
the
ear
o
the
swinging
bean
who
hunts
with
a
hat
cocked
half
awry
the
o
the
o
ho
o
hi
oh
well
know
i
an
elf
there
is
where
the
clover
tips
a
horn
whence
the
summer
leaks
and
drips
where
lanthorns
of
bloom
in
the
dusk
awaits
the
bee
dull
boom
gay
gold
brocade
from
head
to
knee
who
robs
the
caravan
big
bags
of
honey
pay
to
the
bandit
elf
of
the
fairy
way
o
ho
o
hey
i
have
heard
them
say
another
ouphen
the
butterflies
know
who
paints
their
wings
like
the
buds
that
blow
flowers
staining
the
through
seals
their
colors
in
tubes
of
dew
colors
to
dazzle
the
butterflies
wing
the
evening
moth
is
another
thing
the
butterfly
glory
he
got
at
dawn
the
got
when
the
moon
was
wan

it
is
that
the
hollyhocks
hear
who
dangles
a
brilliant
i
each
one
ear
teases
at
noon
the
pane
green
fly
and
lights
at
night
the
eye
o
ho
o
hi
oh
well
know
i
but
the
dearest
elf
so
the
poets
say
is
the
elf
who
hides
in
an
eye
of
gray
who
curls
in
a
dimple
and
slips
along
the
strings
of
a
lute
or
a
lover
song
shines
in
a
scent
or
wings
a
rhyme
and
laughs
in
the
bells
of
a
wedding
chime
hides
unhidden
where
none
may
know
in
her
bosom
blossom
or
throat
blue
bow
o
ho
o
ho
a
friend
or
foe
who
the
loser
who
the
winner
if
the
fancy
fail
as
preacher
none
who
loved
was
yet
beginner
though
another
love
revealment
of
the
inner
life
and
deity
the
teacher
who
may
falsify
the
feeling
to
the
lover
who
is
loser
has
she
felt
the
mere
revealing
of
the
passion
his
accuser
she
conceals
it
the
concealing
is
her
own
love
one
hath
said
no
flower
knoweth
of
the
fragrance
it
revealeth
song
its
soul
that
overfloweth
never
nightingale
heart
feeleth
such
the
love
the
spirit
groweth
love
unconscious
if
it
healeth
handsels
of
anemones
the
surrendered
hours
pour
about
the
sweet
spring
knees
crowding
babies
of
the
breeze
her
unstudied
flowers
when
is
dawn
bestowing
day
strews
with
coins
of
golden
every
furlong
of
his
way
like
a
sultan
gone
to
pray
at
a
kaaba
olden
warlock
night
when
dips
the
dark
opens
tire
on
tire
windows
of
an
heavenly
ark
whence
the
stars
swarm
spark
on
spark
butterflies
of
fire
with
the
night
the
day
the
spring
godly
chords
of
beauty
we
the
instrument
will
string
of
our
lives
and
love
shall
sing
songs
of
truth
and
duty
how
it
was
i
can
not
tell
for
i
know
not
where
nor
why
and
the
beautiful
befell
in
a
land
that
does
not
lie
east
or
west
where
mortals
dwell
but
beneath
a
vaguer
sky
was
it
in
the
golden
ages
or
the
iron
that
i
heard
in
prophetic
speech
of
sages
how
had
come
a
snowy
bird
whose
wing
lay
written
pages
of
an
unknown
lover
word
i
forget
you
may
remember
how
the
earthquake
shook
our
ships
how
our
city
one
huge
ember
blazed
within
the
thick
eclipse
when
you
found
me
deep
december
sealed
on
icy
eyes
and
lips
i
forget
no
one
may
say
are
true
here
a
flower
dies
resurrected
blooms
anew
death
is
dumb
and
life
is
gray
who
shall
doubt
what
god
can
do
as
to
this
nothing
to
tell
you
being
all
my
belief
doubt
may
not
enter
or
dwell
here
where
your
image
is
chief
royal
to
quicken
or
quell
swaying
no
sceptre
of
grief
wise
with
the
wisdom
of
spring
a
world
in
each
prism
gems
from
the
universe
ring
free
of
all
creed
and
all
schism
buds
that
are
speechless
but
bring
god
aphorism
see
how
the
synod
is
met
there
of
the
planets
to
preach
us
freed
from
the
frost
oubliette
here
how
the
flowers
beseech
us
were
it
not
well
to
forget
winter
and
night
as
they
teach
us
a
bud
and
a
star
these
each
a
separate
thought

your

sad

and
a

rain
dripping
from
streaming
eaves
over

over

dead
drop
of
the

and
the
woodward
winding
lane
and
the
hill
with
its

of
sheaves
one
scarce

must
i
go
in
such
sad
weather
by

over

the

we
oft
have
stolen
to
the
bridge
that
rambles
round
with
willows
crowned
through
a
bottom
wild
with
berry

packed
with
the
with
their
blue

washed
and
very
purple

glint
green

leads
a

beseeches
and
the
balsams
budding
balls
smell
drenched
by
the
way
which
reaches
the
wood
where
the

falls
where
the
warty
hang

one

of

my

instead
of

soaking

through

i
run
it
how
sweet
to
meet
in
the

our
rock
with
the

upon
it
each

a
fiery
jet
he

deep
are
the

here
that
lay
lush
lambent
leaves
along
our

or

float
white
nenuphars
about
our

this
side
the

we

reached
two

strokes
our
skiff

there

foxgrapes

we
through
this

fringe
the

down
the

where
old

cottonwoods
build

a

slant
the

three
glittering
jays
flash
over
slim
the

who

such

rinses
with
a
gush
of
mellow
music
gurgling
on

ragged
shore

from

here
the

are
irised

clump
the
water
gray
that
glasses
broken

and
deepened
distance
far
the
musical
persistence
of
a
lingers
low
in
the
west
where
tulips
blow
white

flames
one
pointed

with

in

the

bleach
through

ere

sunday
shall
we
ride
together
not
the
rambling
way
through
the
woods
we
went
that
day
in
the
sultry
summer
weather
past
the
methodist
where
religion
helped
the
hymn
gather
volume
and
a
slim
minister
with
textful
greeting
welcomed
us
and
still
expounded
from
the
service
on
the
hill
we
had
rode
three
hills
and
still
far
away
the
singing
sounded
nor
that
road
through
weed
and
berry
drowsy
days
led
me
and
you
to
the
barbecue
where
the
made
merry
dusty
vehicles
together
darkies
with
the
horses
by
the
soft
kentucky
sky
and
a
smell
of
bark
and
leather
when
you
smiled
our
modern
tourney
gallantry
and
politics
dinner
dance
and
intermix
as
we
went
the
homeward
journey
hot
chaparrals
and
thickets
heard
brisk
fiddles
scraping
still
drone
and
thump
the
quaint
quadrille
like
a
worried
band
of
neither
road
the
shady
quiet
of
that
way
by
beech
and
birch
winding
to
the
ruined
church
on
the
fork
that
sparkles
by
it
where
the
silent
sundays
listen
for
the
preacher
whom
we
bring
in
our
hearts
to
preach
and
sing
shade
to
sabbath
glisten
at
yes
when
the
morn
pentecost
of
flame
uncloses
portals
that
the
stars
adorn
whence
a
golden
presence
throws
his
fiery
swords
and
burning
roses
at
the
wide
wood
world
of
wall
spears
of
sparkle
at
each
fall
then
together
let
us
ride
down
cathedral
places
where
the
pilgrim
hide
praying
sabbath
in
their
faces
where
in
truest
untaught
phrases
worship
in
each
rhythmic
word
sings
no
migratory
bird
pearl
on
pearl
the
high
stars
dight
jewels
of
divine
devices
the
afric
throat
of
night
where
yon
misty
glimmer
rises
soon
the
white
moon
crystallizes
out
of
darkness
like
a
late

farewell
part
iii
now
rests
the
season
in
forgetfulness
careless
in
beauty
of
maturity
the
ripened
roses
brown
temples
she
fulfils
completion
in
a
dreamy
guess
now
time
grants
night
the
more
and
day
the
less
the
gray
decides
and
brown
dim
golds
and
reds
in
dulling
greens
express
themselves
and
broaden
as
the
year
goes
down
sadder
the
croft
where
thrusting
gray
and
high
their
balls
of
seeds
the
hoary
onions
die
where
pumpkins
lie
deeper
each
wilderness
sadder
the
blue
of
hills
that
lounge
along
the
lonesome
west
sadder
the
song
of
the
wild
in
the
leafage
yellow
deeper
and
dreamier
aye
than
woods
or
waters
leans
the
languid
sky
above
lone
orchards
where
the
drips
and
the
russets
mellow
nature
grows
liberal
under
woodland
leaves
the
burs
their
little
pockets
poke
plump
with
the
copper
of
the
nuts
that
choke
above
our
bristling
way
the
spider
weaves
a
glittering
web
for
which
the
dawn
designs
thrice
twenty
rows
of
sparkles
by
the
oak
that
rolls
old
roots
in
many
gnarly
lines
the
acorn
thimble
smoothly
broke
shines
by
its
saucer
on
sonorous
pines
the
far
wind
organs
but
the
forest
here
to
no
weak
breeze
hath
woke
far
off
the
wind
but
crumbling
near
and
near
each
tingling
twig
expectant
and
the
gray
surmise
of
heaven
pilots
it
the
way
rippling
the
leafy
spines
until
the
wildwood
one
exultant
sway
booms
and
the
sunlight
arrowing
through
it
shines
visible
applause
you
hear
how
glows
the
garden
though
the
white
mists
keep
the
vagabond
in
flowers
reminded
of
decay
that
comes
to
slay
in
open
love
when
the
full
moon
hangs
cold
and
night
is
deep
unheeding
such
their
cardinal
colors
leap
gay
in
the
crescent
of
the
blade
of
death
spaced
innocents
in
swaths
he
weeps
to
reap
waiting
his
scythe
a
breath
to
gravely
lay
them
dead
with
one
last
long
long
admire
their
splendors
manifold
the
scarlet
salvia
showered
with
spurts
of
fire
cascading
lattices
dark
vines
that
creep
nightshade
and
cypress
there
the
marigold
burning
a
shred
of
orange
sunset
caught
and
elfed
in
petals
that
eve
goblins
brought
from
elfland
there
predominant
red
the
dahlia
lifts
its
head
by
the
white
balsams
horns
of
honey
in
humming
spaces
sunny
the
crickets
singing
dirges
noon
and
night
for
flowers
at
dusk
already
dead
for
flowers
weep
while
tired
summer
white
where
yonder
aster
whispering
odor
rocks
the
withered
poppies
knotted
in
her
locks
sighs
her
sleepy
hollyhocks
asleep
the
hips
were
reddening
on
the
rose
the
haws
hung
slips
of
fire
we
went
the
woodland
way
that
goes
up
hills
of
branch
and
briar
the
hooked
thorn
held
her
gown
and
seemed
imploring
her
be
staying
the
sunlight
of
herself
that
beamed
beside
it
gently
swaying
low
bent
the
golden
saxifrage
its
yellow
bells
like
bangles
the
foxglove
fluttered
like
a
page
from
out
the
angles
with
crimson
plume
the
sumach
hosed
in
lincoln
green
attended
my
lady
of
the
elder
posed
in
jewels
splendid
and
as
we
mounted
up
the
hill
the
rocky
path
that
stumbled
spread
smooth
and
all
the
day
was
still
and
odorous
with
umbled
tops
of
drying
gray
and
there
before
us
an
orchard
dwindling
away
with
dappled
boughs
bent
us
an
orchard
where
the
pippin
fell
bruised
and
dusty
and
each
like
a
bell
the
bartlett
ripened
rusty
the
smell
of
tawny
peach
and
plum
that
offered
luscious
yellow
of
wasp
and
bee
the
hidden
hum
made
all
the
warm
air
mellow
and
on
we
went
where
hung
wild
the
their
blue
balloons
in
shadows
dewed
with
hoary
in
bush
and
burgrass
far
away
beneath
us
stretched
the
valley
cleft
by
one
creek
that
laughed
with
day
and
babbled
musically
the
brown
the
bronze
the
gray
the
red
of
weed
and
briar
ran
riot
flush
to
dark
woodland
walls
that
led
to
nooks
of
whispering
quiet
long
feathering
bursts
of
ran
golden
woolly
patches
of
the
withered
sod
the
dying
summer
catches
then
the
hills
rolled
expectation
the
sunset
flaming
marigold
a
system
conflagration
and
homeward
turning
she
and
i
went
as
one
self
in
being
god
met
us
in
the
earth
and
sky
and
love
had
purged
our
seeing
say
my
dear
o
my
dear
these
are
the
eves
for
speaking
there
is
no
wight
will
work
us
spite
beneath
the
sunset
streaking
yes
my
dear
o
my
dear
these
are
the
eves
for
telling
to
walk
together
in
starry
weather
ere
springs
o
the
moon
are
welling
o
my
dear
yes
my
dear
these
are
the
dusks
for
staying
when
twilight
dreams
of
night
who
seems
among
praying
no
my
dear
yes
my
dear
these
are
the
nights
to
kiss
it
times
they
grow
on
lips
that
will
not
miss
it
to
dream
where
silence
sleeps
a
sorrow
sleep
that
sighs
where
all
heaven
azure
peeps
blue
from
one
wildflower
eyes
where
in
reflecting
deeps
of
cloudier
woods
and
skies
another
gray
world
lies
divining
god
from
things
humble
as
weeds
and
bees
from
songs
the
free
bird
sings
learn
all
are
vain
but
these
in
springs
wise
trees
seek
love
philosophies
here
where
the
days
are
dimmest
each
old
tree
gives
bounteous
sympathy
here
where
dead
nights
sit
grimmest
in
druid
company
here
where
the
days
are
dimmest
leaves
of
my
lone
communion
leaves
and
the
listening
sigh
of
silence
wanders
by
while
on
my
soul
the
union
is
of
the
wood
and
sky
leaves
of
my
lone
communion
and
eyes
with
tears
are
aching
while
life
waits
wistfully
for
love
that
may
not
be
in
visions
vain
of
waking
lives
all
it
can
not
and
eyes
with
tears
are
aching
and
eyes
with
tears
are
aching
and
here
alone
i
sit
and
see
it
so
a
vale
of
willows
swelling
into
knobs
a
bulwark
eastward
sloping
low
westward
the
scooping
waters
flow
under
a
rocky
culvert
arch
that
throbs
with
clanging
wheels
of
transient
trains
that
go
screaming
to
north
and
south
here
all
the
weary
waters
stagnant
stayed
sleep
at
the
culvert
mouth
the
current
hungry
hiccup
still
afraid
haply
that
i
should
never
know
the
secret
the
striate
scum
o
the
stream
the
devil
and
the
dream
i
dropping
gravels
so
the
echo
sob
mocking
and
thin
as
music
of
a
shade
in
shades
that
wring
from
rocks
a
hollow
woe
complaining
phantoms
of
faint
whispers
rob
there
up
the
valley
where
the
lank
grass
leaps
blades
each
a
crooked
kris
the
currents
strike
or
miss
dream
melodies
no
mallow
sleeps
monandrous
flowers
oval
as
a
kiss
no
mandrake
curling
convolutions
up
loops
heavy
blossoms
each
a
conical
cup
that
swoons
and
a
serpent
hiss
no
where
the
crayfish
play
mirrors
a
savage
face
a
copper
hue
streaked
with
a
crimson
dew
no
in
endless
error
keeps
sewing
the
gown
of
day
with
tangled
stitches
of
a
burning
blue
whose
brilliant
body
but
a
needle
is
an
azurn
and
incarnate
ray
but
here
where
haunted
with
the
shade
the
dull
stream
stales
and
dies
are
beauties
none
or
few
such
sinister
and
new
and
one
at
widest
shrinks
afraid
beneath
the
timid
skies
so
if
you
ask
me
why
i
answer
this
you
know
not
only
where
the
kildees
wade
there
in
the
foamy
scum
there
where
the
wet
rocks
ail
low
rocks
to
which
the
come
basking
pied
bodies
in
the
brindled
shade
dim
as
a
bubble
prism
on
the
grail
below
an
angled
sparkle
rayed
while
lights
and
shadows
aid
from
clouds
that
lounge
at
sunny
loss
deep
down
a
sense
of
wavy
features
quail
the
heart
with
lips
that
writhe
and
fade
and
clench
tough
rooty
limbs
that
twist
and
cross
and
flabby
hair
of
smoky
moss
a
brimstone
sunset
and
at
night
the
twinkling
flies
in
dance
wheel
through
copse
and
open
all
a
gnomish
green
i
hear
the
water
and
the
wave
is
white
there
where
the
boulder
plants
a
keel
and
each
taunt
ripple
where
instant
insects
dot
the
dark
with
spurts
of
sulphur
bright
beneath
the
hazy
height
no
trees
make
wan
the
night
building
bloom
ridges
of
a
ghostly
lustre
but
tossing
cluster
over
cluster
within
that
twilight
spot
as
if
a
giant
half
asleep
had
dropped
his
while
he
drove
his
sheep
foldward
through
fallow
browns
and
foxy
grays
a
something
crowns
the
knoll
is
it
the
odorous
peak
of
one
timothy
stack
now
one
dead
ash
behind
a
weak
moon
shows
a
withered
cheek
of
quaker
quiet
wasted
the
appentice
ruins
roofing
pillared
pines
beyond
these
back
and
back
an
stretches
black
and
here
the
whining
of
the
wind
snuff
snarling
but
their
eyes
are
blind
although
their
fangs
are
fierce
and
though
they
never
pierce
beyond
the
bad
bedevilled
woodland
streak
i
hear
them
yes
i
hear
a
padding
o
footsteps
near
a
prowling
pant
in
ear
and
can
not
fly
yes
no
what
horror
holds
me
that
uncoiling
slow
sure
mastering
chimera
there
hooping
firm
unseen
feelers
my
neck
a
binding
bruising
coil
the
waters
burn
and
boil
the
the
dappled
darkness
fleck
with
impish
dabs
of
blazing
wizard
oil
deep
deep
into
the
black
eye
of
the
beck
i
stare
magnetic
fixed
and
little
reck
if
all
the
writhing
shadow
slips
dripping
around
me
to
the
eyes
and
hips
where
grinning
murder
leers
with
lupine
lips
what
can
it
mean
for
me
what
have
i
done
to
her
i
in
our
freedom
of
love
as
a
sun
to
her
she
to
our
liberty
goddess
and
slumberless
moon
of
the
stars
shining
silver
and
numberless
who
on
my
life
that
was
thorny
and
showery
came
and
made
dewyness
smiled
and
made
flowery
mine
the
affinitized
one
of
humanity
mine
the
elected
of
soul
over
vanity
what
have
i
done
to
her
what
have
i
done
what
can
it
mean
for
me
what
have
i
said
to
her
i
who
have
idolized
worshipped
and
pled
to
her
sung
for
her
laughed
for
her
sorrowed
and
sighed
for
her
lived
for
her
hated
and
gladly
had
died
for
her
see
she
has
written
me
thus
she
has
written
me
sooner
would
dagger
or
serpent
had
smitten
me
would
they
had
shrivelled
or
ever
they
read
of
it
eyes
that
are
wide
to
the
bitterest
dread
of
it
what
have
i
said
to
her
what
have
i
said
what
shall
i
make
of
it
i
who
am
trembling
fearful
of
loss
oh
enamored
dissembling
flame
of
the
candle
that
burning
but
guttering
flatters
the
moth
that
comes
circling
and
fluttering
out
of
the
summer
night
trusting
importunate
quitting
cool
flowers
for
this
o
unfortunate
such
has
she
been
to
me
making
me
such
to
her
slaying
me
saying
i
never
was
much
to
her
what
shall
i
make
of
it
what
can
i
make
love
in
thy
everglades
moaning
and
motionless
look
i
have
fallen
the
evil
is
potionless
i
with
no
thought
but
the
heavens
that
lock
us
in
set
naked
feet
the
cottonmouth
moccasin
under
the
cherokee
eying
me
in
the
sweet
blue
with
the
egrets
that
flying
me
loosened
like
blooms
from
magnolias
rose
slenderly
white
and
pale
pink
where
the
tenderly
sang
making
vistas
of
mosses
melodious
wandered
unheeding
my
steps
in
the
odious
slime
that
was
venom
i
followed
the
fiery
violet
curve
of
thy
star
falling
wiry
so
was
i
lost
in
night
thus
am
undone
have
i
not
told
to
her
living
alone
for
her
purposed
unfoldments
of
love
i
had
sown
for
her
here
in
the
soil
of
my
soul
their
variety
endless
and
ever
she
answered
with
see
it
has
come
to
this
all
the
tale
suavity
at
the
ninth
chapter
grows
stupid
with
gravity
duller
than
death
all
our
beautiful
history
close
it
the
is
more
than
a
yes
i
will
tell
her
this
yes
i
will
tell
i
seem
to
hear
her
speak
and
see
that
room
her
perfume
comes
from
lavender
folds
vined
dreamily
with
brocaded
blooms
a
stuff
of
orient
looms
again
i
hear
her
speak
and
back
where
steals
the
showery
sunlight
piles
a
whatnot
dainty
beside
a
tall
clock
each
glazed
profile
smiles
i
hear
her
say
ah
had
we
known
could
what
has
been
have
ever
been
and
now
how
hurt
the
hard
ache
shone
in
eyes
whose
sadness
seemed
to
lean
on
something
far
unseen
and
as
in
sleep
my
own
self
seems
outside
my
suffering
self
i
flush
in
mists
of
undetermined
dreams
behold
her
musing
in
that
hush
of
lilac
light
and
plush
smiling
but
tortured
yes
i
feel
despite
that
face
not
seeming
sad
in
those
calm
temples
thoughts
like
steel
remorseless
bore
i
had
gone
mad
had
i
once
deemed
her
glad
unconsciously
with
eyes
that
yearn
to
pierce
beyond
the
present
far
searching
some
future
hope
i
turn
there
in
her
garden
one
fierce
star
beyond
the
window
bar
vermilion
as
a
sun
a
phyllocactus
all
the
life
of
torrid
middays
in
but
one
rich
crimson
bloom
flames
red
as
strife
and
near
it
rankly
rife
deep
coreopsis
heavy
hues
of
soft
and
satiny
gold
sway
girandoles
whose
jets
of
dews
burn
points
of
starlight
manifold
she
dare
not
speak
i
can
not
yet
an
intercourse
brain
and
brain
goes
feverish
crushed
smelling
wet
through
silken
curtains
drift
again
of
rain
i
in
the
doorway
turn
and
stay
angry
her
cameo
beauty
mark
set
in
that
smile
oh
will
she
say
no
farewell
no
regret
one
spark
of
hope
to
cheer
the
dark
that
conceive
it
so
a
roguish
head
with
jaunty
eyes
laughing
beneath
a
unmasking
it
denies
the
flower
surprise
hung
her
davenport
we
read
the
true
beneath
the
false
perceive
the
smile
that
hides
the
indeed
soul
unmasks
not
mine
i
grieve
here
here
but
laugh
and
leave
beyond
the
knotty
that
fade
about
the
old
its
tattered
arms
and
tattered
knees
a
tosses
to
the
breeze
among
the
shocks
of
corn
all
things
grow
gray
in
earth
and
sky
the
cold
wind
sounding
drearily
makes
all
the
rusty
branches
fly
the
rustling
leaves
lie
the
year
is
waning
wearily
at
night
i
hear
the
far
wild
geese
honk
in
heavens
under
arcturus
though
i
seem
to
cease
outside
myself
and
sleep
in
peace
i
drowse
awake
and
wonder
i
know
torn
thistles
by
the
creek
hang
hairy
with
the
frost
the
tented
brown
acres
of
the
corn
stretch
bleak
and
ghostly
in
the
moonlight
weak
in
hollows
dream
back
the
ways
we
strolled
at
morn
through
woods
of
summer
ever
singing
beneath
the
crooked
thorn
the
tasselled
meads
of
cane
and
corn
their
restless
shadows
swinging
i
stand
and
oar
our
boat
among
the
dripping
lilies
of
the
river
i
reach
her
hat
the
long
struck
in
the
stream
we
sing
a
song
that
song
i
wake
and
shiver
and
then
my
feverish
mind
reverts
to
our
sad
words
and
sadder
parting
in
days
long
gone
and
oh
it
hurts
within
here
for
the
soul
asserts
mine
the
fool
fault
from
starting
and
i
must
lie
awake
and
think
of
her
with
such
regrets
as
gladly
no
unrebuking
conscience
shrink
and
hear
the
clangor
sink
through
plaintive
starlight
sadly
when
all
are
overflown
and
deep
the
stoic
night
is
left
forsaken
for
company
i
well
would
weep
since
all
my
spirit
fears
to
sleep
sleep
of
such
visions
shaken
grave
visions
of
dead
deeds
that
flaw
our
waking
hours
ever
haunting
else
were
we
lacking
love
and
law
rude
things
of
sticks
and
straw
undaunted
and
undaunting
the
sun
a
splintered
splendor
was
in
sober
trees
that
broke
and
blurred
that
afternoon
we
went
together
in
droning
hum
and
whirling
buzz
where
hard
the
dinning
locust
whirred
through
fields
of
so
sweet
it
was
to
look
and
lean
to
your
young
face
and
feel
the
light
of
eyes
that
fondled
mine
unsaddened
the
laugh
that
left
lips
more
serene
the
words
that
blossomed
like
the
white
there
and
gladdened
maturing
summer
you
were
fraught
with
wiser
beauties
then
than
now
parades
rich
autumn
red
november
this
stuns
there
dreams
no
subtle
thought
as
then
on
hinting
bush
and
bough
but
now
i
am
alone
remember
through
and
roses
and
bronzing
beech
and
oak
old
porches
it
discloses
above
the
briars
and
roses
fall
feeble
sunbeams
soak
neglected
walks
that
tangle
the
grass
its
chimney
shows
one
angle
heaped
with
dead
leaves
that
spangle
the
paths
that
round
it
pass
the
early
mists
that
bury
and
hide
them
in
its
rooms
from
spider
closets
very
dim
with
old
webs
will
hurry
out
in
the
raining
glooms
they
haunt
each
stair
and
basement
they
stand
on
hearth
and
porch
lean
from
each
paneless
casement
or
in
the
moonlight
lacement
fly
with
a
phantom
torch
there
is
a
sense
of
frost
here
and
gusts
that
sob
away
of
something
that
was
lost
here
long
long
ago
was
lost
here
but
what
they
can
not
say
there
croons
no
owl
to
startle
despondency
within
no
raven
its
portal
to
scare
the
daring
mortal
and
guard
its
cellared
sin
the
creaking
road
descries
it
this
side
the
dusty
toll
the
farmer
passing
eyes
it
none
stops
t
philosophize
it
this
symbol
of
a
soul
though
the
violet
come
with
the
shower
and
the
haunt
and
hum
every
flower
we
shall
never
wend
as
when
love
laughed
leading
us
from
men
over
violet
vale
and
glen
where
the
sang
an
hour
and
we
heard
the
partridge
drum
here
october
shadows
pray
till
one
stills
joyance
where
for
buried
may
sob
the
rills
so
love
vision
has
arisen
of
the
long
ago
i
listen
memory
tears
in
eyes
that
glisten
points
but
indiana
hills
fading
far
away
part
iv
when
in
her
cloudy
chiton
spring
freed
the
donjoned
rills
and
trumpeting
a
triton
was
on
the
hills
ways
hope
buds
bedizen
long
ways
the
glory
lies
on
love
spread
us
an
horizon
of
gold
beyond
life
ills
when
summer
came
with
sickle
stuck
in
a
sheaf
of
gleams
and
eves
were
from
of
the
beams
scrolls
of
the
days
scrolls
of
the
night
to
love
and
us
allotted
a
world
of
woven
dreams
when
autumn
waited
tired
a
heretic
frost
fired
in
winter
bishopric
our
loves
a
song
had
started
grew
with
the
song
sweet
loves
were
parted
though
life
for
love
was
sick
now
is
the
winter
waited
skies
of
frozen
gold
or
raining
heavens
hated
of
winds
that
curse
and
shall
this
be
so
that
never
shall
sunlight
snowlight
sever
forever
and
forever
the
heart
wait
soft
music
bring
that
seems
to
weep
all
this
dull
sorrow
of
the
soul
vague
music
soft
to
utter
sleep
sleep
and
undying
dole
forgetting
not
forgotten
most
how
love
is
well
though
lost
so
weary
oh
and
yet
so
fain
in
silent
service
of
the
heart
still
feeling
if
it
be
in
vain
love
spirit
hath
his
part
and
if
in
death
god
grant
the
rest
life
were
but
kind
at
best
last
night
i
slept
till
midnight
then
woke
and
far
away
a
cock
crowed
lonely
and
distant
came
mournful
a
bay
but
lonelier
slower
the
tedious
old
clock
ticked
on
towards
day
and
what
a
day
remember
the
morns
of
a
summer
and
spring
that
bound
two
lives
together
each
morn
a
wedding
ring
of
dew
and
dreams
and
sparkle
of
flowers
and
birds
broad
morns
when
i
strolled
the
garden
awaiting
one
the
rose
expected
fresh
in
its
blushes
the
giant
of
battle
that
grows
a
head
of
radiance
and
fragrance
the
champion
of
the
close
not
in
vain
did
i
wait
departed
summer
this
morning
mocks
the
powdery
crystal
and
crimson
of
your
hollow
hollyhocks
your
and
poppies
and
the
bee
that
in
them
rocks
the
pendulous
purple
of
the
vine
by
the
giant
pearls
pellucid
of
the
peonies
the
snapdragons
and
the
jewel
mine
shall
i
ever
see
my
mealy
drunk
gay
my
bashful
of
butterfly
and
ray
my
gillyflowers
as
spicy
each
as
a
day
of
may
oh
dear
when
i
think
of
the
handfuls
of
little
gold
coin
my
scatter
over
the
garden
grass
of
the
marigold
that
boasts
its
one
bit
of
burning
brass
more
bitter
i
feel
the
winter
tighten
to
spirit
and
heart
and
dream
of
the
days
remembered
as
lost
of
the
past
a
part
of
the
ways
we
went
all
blotted
on
love
chart
and
i
see
the
mill
and
the
diamonds
of
foam
tossed
from
its
wheel
red
lilies
tumbled
together
the
madcap
wind
at
heel
and
the
timid
veronicas
blossoms
those
prayers
the
woods
conceal
the
gray
of
the
meadows
that
the
daisies
dot
and
a
that
tangle
a
tawny
spot
as
if
some
panther
tired
lay
dozing
tame
and
hot
ah
back
again
with
the
present
with
winds
that
pinch
and
twist
each
leaf
in
their
peevish
passion
and
whirl
wherever
they
list
with
the
morning
hoary
and
nipping
whose
mausolean
mist
builds
white
a
tomb
for
the
daylight
a
frosty
shaggy
fog
that
fits
gray
wigs
on
the
cedars
and
furs
with
wool
each
log
carpets
with
satin
the
meadow
and
velvets
white
the
bog
alone
at
morn
indifferent
alone
at
eve
i
sigh
and
wait
like
the
wind
complaining
complain
and
know
not
why
but
ailing
and
longing
and
hating
because
i
can
not
die
how
dull
are
the
sunsets
dreary
cold
hard
and
harsh
and
dead
far
richer
were
those
of
august
one
stain
of
red
the
juice
of
a
mulberry
vintage
to
the
new
moon
overhead
but
now
i
sit
with
the
sighing
dead
wests
of
a
dying
year
like
the
fallen
leaves
and
the
acorns
am
worthless
and
feel
as
sear
for
the
soul
and
the
body
sicken
and
the
heart
one
scalding
tear
and
i
stare
from
my
window
the
darkness
like
a
bravo
his
cloak
throws
on
the
moon
like
a
hidden
lanthorn
glitters
or
dagger
drawn
all
my
heart
cries
out
beseeching
strike
here
strike
and
be
gone
when
friends
are
sighing
round
one
and
one
nearer
is
lying
nearer
the
sun
when
one
is
dying
and
all
is
done
i
may
remember
you
may
forget
words
each
an
ember
burning
here
yet
in
dead
december
one
will
regret
love
we
have
given
over
and
all
who
has
driven
us
from
his
door
is
he
forgiven
when
he
is
poor
what
if
you
wept
once
what
though
he
knew
what
if
he
slept
once
still
he
was
true
if
he
but
kept
once
something
of
you
never
forgetful
love
may
forget
froward
and
fretful
child
he
will
fret
ever
regretful
he
will
regret
love
would
be
sweeter
if
we
but
knew
lives
be
completer
to
themselves
true
hearts
more
in
metre
truth
looking
through
flesh
never
near
it
being
impure
mind
must
endear
it
making
it
sure
love
in
the
spirit
that
will
endure
so
when
ceases
and
we
quit
this
we
borrow
mortality
such
chastens
sorrow
so
it
may
see
there
will
be
weeping
weary
and
deep
god
be
the
keeping
of
those
that
weep
when
our
loved
sleeping
sleep
their
long
sleep
then
they
are
dearer
than
we
aware
character
clearer
being
more
fair
then
they
are
nearer
nearer
by
prayer
they
will
not
say
i
can
not
live
beyond
the
weary
night
but
then
i
know
that
i
shall
die
before
comes
morning
light
how
frail
is
flesh
but
you
forgive
me
now
i
tell
you
how
i
loved
you
love
you
and
the
pain
it
gives
to
leave
you
now
this
could
not
be
on
earth
the
flesh
that
clothes
the
soul
of
me
ordained
at
birth
a
sacrifice
to
this
heredity
denied
ah
you
have
seen
the
bright
spots
in
my
cheeks
grow
hectic
as
before
comes
night
blood
dyes
the
sunset
streaks
consumption
but
i
promised
you
my
love
is
left
forlorn
of
life
god
summons
unto
him
and
is
it
then
forsworn
oh
i
was
glad
in
love
of
you
but
think
if
i
had
died
ere
babe
of
mine
had
come
to
be
a
solace
at
your
side
had
it
been
little
then
your
grief
when
heaven
had
made
us
one
in
everything
that
good
on
earth
and
then
the
good
undone
no
no
and
had
i
lived
to
raise
a
boy
we
saw
each
day
bud
into
beauty
with
that
blight
born
in
him
that
must
slay
just
when
we
cherish
him
the
most
and
youthful
sunny
pride
sits
on
his
curly
front
he
pines
and
dies
ere
i
have
died
whose
fault
not
mine
but
hers
or
his
that
ancestor
who
gave
escutcheon
to
our
humble
house
a
and
a
grave
beneath
the
pomp
of
those
grim
arms
we
live
and
may
not
move
nor
faith
nor
fame
nor
wealth
avail
to
hurl
them
down
nor
love
how
could
i
tell
you
this
not
then
when
all
the
world
was
spun
of
morning
colors
for
our
love
to
walk
and
dance
upon
i
could
not
tell
you
how
disease
hid
here
a
viper
germ
precedence
slowly
claiming
and
so
slowly
fixing
firm
and
when
i
broke
our
plighted
troth
and
would
not
tell
you
why
i
loved
you
thinking
time
enough
when
i
have
come
to
die
draw
off
my
rings
and
let
my
hands
rest
so
the
wretched
cough
will
interrupt
my
feeble
speech
and
will
not
be
put
off
ah
anyhow
my
anodyne
is
this
to
feel
that
you
are
near
me
that
your
healthy
hand
soothes
mine
unhealthy
dew
and
that
your
heart
excuses
all
and
that
you
will
not
fret
because
you
understand
me
now
and
never
will
now
bring
me
roses
pale
and
pure
and
tell
me
death
a
lie
late
was
it
hard
for
me
to
live
now
it
is
hard
to
die
part
vased
in
her
bedroom
window
white
as
her
glad
girlhood
never
lost
i
smelt
the
roses
and
the
night
outside
was
fog
and
frost
what
though
i
claimed
her
dying
there
god
nor
one
angel
understood
nor
cared
who
from
loved
feet
to
hair
had
changed
to
mist
her
blood
love
love
had
claimed
us
long
and
long
our
hearts
sang
late
and
soon
but
god
god
jangles
thus
the
song
and
makes
discord
of
tune
what
lily
lilier
than
her
face
more
virgin
than
her
lips
i
kissed
when
morn
like
god
with
gold
and
grace
broke
massed
in
mist
broke
massed
in
mist
love
to
your
face
farewell
now
pillowed
a
flower
on
flowers
eyes
with
a
spell
now
lips
with
nothing
to
tell
now
that
bade
adieu
to
ours
dear
is
your
soul
so
daggered
there
by
a
world
that
hates
love
is
ever
laggard
hope
is
face
so
haggard
you
who
are
one
with
the
fates
never
to
wait
under
such
worldly
skies
never
to
sleep
with
sorrow
hour
by
hour
to
borrow
joy
that
has
only
sighs
sweet
farewell
forever
and
a
burning
tear
or
two
will
they
reach
your
knowledge
ever
and
touch
through
the
dreams
that
sever
my
life
from
the
life
of
you
o
life
in
my
flesh
so
fearful
medicine
me
this
pain
thy
eyes
with
a
science
cheerful
but
mine
with
a
mystery
tearful
tearful
and
love
to
your
lips
farewell
now
your
spirit
through
them
i
kiss
lips
so
sealed
with
a
spell
now
lips
with
nothing
to
tell
now
but
this
but
this
but
this
so
long
it
seems
since
last
i
saw
her
face
so
long
ago
it
seems
like
some
sad
soul
in
unconjectured
space
lost
in
the
happiness
of
some
dead
grace
remembered
i
and
oh
a
little
while
the
sorrow
stabs
and
death
conceals
no
smile
from
love
bowed
weeping
in
a
thorny
place
so
long
ago
our
love
is
what
are
dreams
since
she
is
gone
no
more
i
feel
the
light
since
she
is
gone
beyond
burst
like
a
revelation
out
of
night
golden
convictions
of
far
futures
bright
whiles
clouds
around
the
west
take
marble
tones
for
hope
sits
sighing
in
a
place
of
stones
dark
locks
dishevelled
and
face
very
white
since
she
is
gone
and
life
an
iron
bond
now
she
is
dead
the
doubt
love
dulled
with
awe
now
she
is
dead
to
me
questions
the
wisdom
of
diviner
law
of
self
i
search
to
find
a
flaw
o
egotism
of
earth
fools
and
slaves
for
faith
leans
thoughtful
in
a
place
of
graves
on
that
unseen
from
this
seen
known
to
draw
now
she
is
dead
and
it
is
hard
to
see
ridged
and
bleak
the
gray
forsaken
twilight
at
the
night
has
guessed
where
no
star
of
dusk
has
taken
flame
unshaken
in
the
west
all
the
day
the
woodlands
dying
moaned
and
drippings
as
of
grief
tossed
from
barren
boughs
with
sighing
death
of
flying
twig
and
leaf
ah
to
be
a
dream
unbroken
past
the
ironies
of
fate
born
a
tree
with
branches
oaken
dear
unspoken
intimate
who
may
say
that
man
has
never
lived
the
mighty
hearts
of
trees
graduating
godward
ever
the
forever
finds
through
these
colors
we
have
lived
are
cherished
odors
we
have
been
are
ours
entity
alone
has
perished
souls
were
flowers
music
when
the
fancy
guesses
lifts
us
loftier
thoughts
among
spirit
that
the
flesh
distresses
but
expresses
self
with
song
heaven
in
darkness
bends
upbraiding
without
moonlight
without
star
darkness
and
the
reason
aiding
all
but
fading
phantoms
are
still
philosophy
is
saying
now
that
hope
with
life
seems
gone
some
are
cursing
some
are
praying
god
smiles
raying
in
the
dawn
wild
weather
the
whip
of
the
sleet
on
the
shuttered
casement
tapping
a
shadow
from
face
to
feet
like
a
shroud
my
spirit
wrapping
wild
weather
and
how
is
she
now
the
sting
of
the
storm
beats
serried
over
the
stone
and
the
tree
of
the
grave
where
she
is
buried
wild
weather
i
can
not
weep
but
the
skies
weep
on
and
worry
so
i
sleep
and
dream
in
my
sleep
how
i
hear
dim
garments
hurry
star
weather
and
footsteps
of
stars
and
i
see
white
raiment
glisten
like
the
glow
on
the
face
of
mars
when
the
stars
to
the
angels
listen
and
with
me
i
see
how
she
stands
with
lips
high
thought
has
weighted
with
testifying
hands
and
eyes
with
purity
mated
have
i
spoken
and
have
i
kneeled
to
the
prayer
i
worship
i
wonder
what
waits
on
her
lips
that
are
sealed
and
who
shall
sunder
i
sob
oh
your
stay
was
long
you
are
come
but
your
feet
were
laggard
with
mansuetude
and
song
for
a
heart
your
death
has
daggered
and
i
lift
wet
eyes
to
her
unutterable
with
weeping
and
beg
for
the
loves
that
were
now
passed
into
heaven
keeping
i
wake
and
a
clock
tolls
three
and
the
night
and
the
storm
lie
serried
on
the
testament
that
she
closed
clasped
and
forever
buried
the
night
is
shrewd
with
storm
and
sleet
each
casement
raps
or
groans
i
hear
the
wailing
woodland
beat
the
tempest
with
long
blatant
moans
like
one
who
fears
defeat
and
sitting
here
beyond
the
storm
alone
within
the
lonely
house
it
seems
of
sleep
the
fairy
charm
weaves
incantations
even
the
mouse
that
scratched
has
come
to
harm
and
in
this
grave
light
stolen
familiar
objects
grown
severe
i
strange
as
opening
a
door
one
finds
one
dead
self
standing
near
one
knew
not
dead
before
the
old
stair
rings
with
growling
gusts
each
hearth
flue
gasps
a
gorgon
throat
that
snores
and
sleeps
the
spectral
dusts
which
yonder
shawnee
coat
whose
quiver
hangs
and
rusts
are
shaken
till
i
feel
that
he
who
wore
it
in
the
wild
and
died
in
it
fills
shadowy
its
wampumed
skins
its
plume
perchance
shakes
scowling
eyes
at
me
and
so
the
swedenborge
i
toss
aside
contented
with
the
dark
that
takes
me
the
cross
pass
where
the
andirons
spit
and
spark
and
ponder
her
loss
or
from
the
window
yearn
out
toward
the
waste
where
sway
and
dip
dank
dark
december
boughs
where
burn
some
late
last
leaves
that
icy
drip
no
matter
where
you
turn
where
sodden
soil
you
scarce
have
trod
fills
oozy
footprints
and
the
night
so
ugly
that
it
mocks
at
god
creating
monsters
which
the
sight
fancies
unseen
abroad
the
months
i
count
how
long
it
seems
since
that
bland
summer
when
with
her
there
on
her
porch
in
rainy
gleams
we
watched
the
mellow
lightning
stir
in
gray
as
dreams
when
all
the
west
a
torn
gold
sheet
swift
openings
of
some
titan
forge
laid
bald
with
storm
in
quivering
heat
pitched
precipice
and
nightmare
gorge
where
thunder
torrents
beat
and
strong
the
wind
was
as
again
storm
lit
the
instant
earth
and
how
the
wood
sprang
out
one
virent
stain
we
read
no
more
lost
is
it
now
in
of
a
a
tale
of
nowhere
then
that
we
were
reading
till
we
heard
the
plunge
of
distant
thunder
sullenly
and
left
to
mark
long
lightnings
lunge
convulsions
fiery
what
worlds
love
wrought
us
dreaming
there
of
sorcery
and
necromance
with
spirits
lustrous
of
the
air
a
land
like
one
great
pearl
a
trance
of
floods
and
forests
fair
where
flowers
sang
and
thought
where
fragrant
birds
flew
in
winging
odors
with
light
where
breathing
colors
shone
on
throbbing
music
brought
or
built
us
some
snug
country
home
among
the
hills
with
terraces
and
orchared
the
foam
of
the
ohio
far
one
sees
wind
crimson
in
the
gloam
and
this
and
this
alone
alone
to
hear
the
sweep
of
winter
rain
the
missiled
sleet
sharp
arrows
blown
dark
shadow
on
the
freezing
pane
and
on
my
heart
a
moan
days
and
dreams
he
dreamed
of
hills
so
deep
with
woods
on
the
summer
sky
are
not
more
dark
where
plunged
loud
floods
down
rocks
of
sullen
dye
flat
ways
were
his
where
sparsely
grew
gnarled
oaks
with
rifts
between
dead
boughs
of
ways
where
the
speedwell
lifts
its
shy
appeal
and
spreading
far
the
gold
the
fallen
gold
of
dawn
staining
each
blossom
balanced
star
hollows
of
cowslips
wan
where
the
feet
the
and
creep
white
butterflies
upon
them
rock
or
suck
and
sleep
at
eve
the
west
shoots
crooked
fire
athwart
a
leaning
low
while
one
white
arrowy
star
throbs
higher
in
curdled
was
it
some
elfin
euphrasy
that
purged
his
spirit
so
that
there
blue
harebells
by
those
ways
that
be
seemed
summoning
to
prayer
for
all
the
death
within
him
prays
not
he
his
higher
self
whose
love
the
flesh
its
light
still
stays
touched
by
the
soul
above
they
found
him
dead
his
songs
beside
six
stairs
above
the
din
and
dust
of
life
and
that
for
which
he
died
denied
him
even
a
crust
deity
no
personal
a
god
divinely
crowned
with
gold
and
raised
upon
a
golden
throne
deep
in
a
golden
glory
whence
he
nods
man
this
or
that
and
little
more
than
man
and
shalt
thou
see
him
individual
not
till
the
freed
intelligence
hath
sought
ten
hundred
hundred
years
to
rise
and
love
piercing
the
singing
cycles
under
god
their
iridescent
evolutions
orbed
in
wild
prismatic
splendors
shall
it
see
through
become
a
god
see
lightening
out
of
spheric
harmonies
resplendencies
of
empyrean
light
prisms
and
facets
of
ten
million
beams
starring
a
crystal
of
berainbowed

in
this

of

eyes
deep
as
the
music
of
the
beautiful
and
the

brows
as
they
were

of
seraphic
fire
lips
underneath
of
trembling
ruby
lips
whose

a

of

and
soul
it
came
to
me
in
my
sleep
and
i
rose
from
my
sleep
and
went
out
in
the
night
to
weep
over
the
bristling
bent
with
my
soul
it
seemed
i
stood
alone
in
a
moaning
wood
and
my
soul
said
gazing
at
me
shall
i
show
you
another
land
than
other
this
flesh
can
see
and
took
into
hers
my
we
passed
from
the
wood
to
a
heath
as
starved
as
the
ribs
of
death
three
skeleton
trees
we
pass
bare
bones
on
an
iron
moor
where
every
leaf
and
the
grass
was
a
thorn
and
a
thistle
hoar
and
my
soul
said
looking
on
me
past
of
your
life
you
and
a
passed
with
his
swine
deformed
and
i
heard
him
growl
two
eyes
of
a
sottish
shine
leered
under
two
brows
as
foul
and
my
soul
said
is
the
soils
my
limbs
with
the
and
a
goose
wife
hobbled
by
on
a
crutch
with
the
devil
geese
how
life
is
a
lie
and
cursing
my
soul
without
cease
and
my
soul
said
is
desire
meaning
of
life
is
and
we
came
to
a
garden
close
to
a
hollow
of
graves
and
tombs
a
garden
as
red
as
a
rose
hung
over
of
obscene
glooms
the
heart
of
each
rose
was
a
spark
that
smouldered
or
splintered
the
dark
and
i
was
aware
of
a
girl
with
a
face
who
came
with
a
mouth
like
a
shell
split
pearl
in
a
robe
of
flame
and
she
plucked
the
roses
and
gave
and
my
flesh
was
her
veriest
slave
she
vanished
my
lips
would
have
kissed
the
flowers
she
gave
me
with
sighs
but
they
writhed
in
my
hands
and
hissed
in
their
hearts
were
a
serpent
eyes
and
my
soul
said
is
she
joys
of
the
flesh
you
and
i
bowed
with
a
heart
too
weary
that
longed
for
rest
for
sleep
and
my
eyes
were
heavy
and
teary
and
yearned
for
a
way
to
weep
and
my
soul
smiled
may
be
you
know
me
and
follow
me
the
dream
of
dread
i
have
lain
for
an
hour
or
twain
awake
and
the
tempest
is
beating
on
the
roof
and
the
sleet
on
the
pane
and
the
winds
are
three
enemies
meeting
and
i
listen
and
hear
it
again
my
name
in
the
silence
repeating
then
dumbness
of
death
that
must
slay
till
the
midnight
is
burst
like
a
bubble
and
out
of
the
darkness
a
ray
is
she
the
all
beautiful
double
with
a
face
like
the
breaking
of
day
eyes
dark
with
the
magic
of
trouble
i
move
not
she
lies
with
her
lips
at
mine
and
i
feel
she
is
drawing
my
life
from
my
heart
to
their
tips
my
heart
where
the
horror
is
gnawing
my
life
in
a
thousand
slow
sips
my
flesh
with
her
sorcery
awing
she
binds
me
with
merciless
eyes
she
drinks
of
my
blood
and
i
hear
it
drain
up
with
a
shudder
and
rise
to
the
lips
like
the
serpent
that
steer
it
and
she
lies
and
she
laughs
as
she
lies
saying
lo
thy
affinitized
spirit
then
i
hear
as
if
torturing
swords
had
shivered
and
torments
had
grated
hoarse
iron
deep
under
and
words
as
of
sins
that
howled
out
and
awaited
a
fiend
who
lashed
into
their
hords
and
a
demon
who
lacerated
and
i
shriek
and
lie
clammy
and
stark
as
the
curse
of
a
devil
mounts
higher
up
out
of
damnation
and
dark
up
a
hobble
of
hoofs
that
is
dire
i
feel
that
his
mouth
is
a
spark
his
features
of
filth
and
of
fire
to
thy
body
corruption
thy
grave
thy
hell
from
which
thou
hast
stolen
and
a
blackness
rolls
down
like
a
wave
with
a
clamor
of
tongues
that
are
swollen
and
i
feel
that
my
flesh
is
the
slave
of
a
vampire
diakka
eidolon
death
in
life
within
my
veins
it
beats
and
burns
within
my
brain
for
when
the
year
is
sad
and
sear
i
dream
the
dream
again
ah
over
young
am
i
god
knows
yet
in
this
sleep
more
pain
and
woe
than
women
know
i
know
and
doubly
deep
seven
towers
of
shaggy
rock
rise
red
to
ragged
skies
built
in
a
marsh
that
black
and
harsh
to
dead
horizons
lies
eternal
sunset
pours
around
its
warlock
towers
a
glowing
urn
where
garnets
burn
with
flowers
turrets
high
stretched
in
a
scarlet
line
the
crimson
cranes
through
rosy
rains
drop
like
a
ruby
wine
once
in
the
these
scarlet
storks
are
heard
i
sit
at
board
with
men
o
th
sword
and
knights
of
noble
word
cased
all
in
silver
mail
but
he
i
love
and
fear
in
glittering
gold
beside
me
bold
sits
like
a
lover
near
wild
music
echoes
in
the
hollow
towers
there
behind
bright
bars
o
his
visor
stars
beam
in
his
eyes
and
glare
wild
music
oozes
from
arched
ceilings
caked
with
white
groined
pearl
and
floors
like
mythic
shores
that
sing
to
seas
of
light
wild
music
and
a
feast
and
one
belovèd
near
in
burning
mail
why
am
i
pale
so
pale
with
grief
and
fear
red
heavens
and
the
marsh
to
west
and
east
seven
slits
of
sky
seven
casements
high
flare
on
the
feast
our
torches
tall
are
these
our
revel
torches
seven
that
spill
from
gold
soft
splendors
old
the
hour
of
night
eleven
no
word
the
sparkle
aches
in
cups
of
that
prism
the
light
of
ruddy
white
in
royal
wines
of
war
no
word
rich
plate
that
rays
splashes
of
splitting
fires
off
beryl
brims
while
sobs
and
swims
enchantment
of
lost
lyres
i
lean
to
him
i
love
and
in
the
silence
say
would
thy
dear
grace
reveal
thy
face
if
love
should
crave
and
pray
grave
silence
like
a
king
at
that
strange
feast
is
set
grave
silence
still
as
the
soul
will
that
rules
the
reason
yet
but
when
i
speak
behold
the
charm
is
snapped
for
low
speaks
out
the
mask
o
his
golden
casque
at
midnight
be
it
so
and
silence
waits
severe
till
one
sonorous
tower
that
looms
in
glaring
glooms
sounds
slow
the
midnight
hour
three
strokes
the
knights
arise
the
palsy
from
them
flung
to
meward
mock
like
some
hoarse
rock
when
wrecking
waves
give
tongue
six
strokes
and
wailing
out
the
music
hoots
away
the
fiery
glimmer
of
eve
dies
dimmer
the
red
grows
ghostly
gray
nine
strokes
and
dropping
mould
the
crumbling
hall
is
lead
the
plate
is
rust
the
feast
is
dust
the
banqueters
are
dead
twelve
strokes
pound
out
and
roll
the
huge
walls
writhe
and
shake
hissing
things
with
taloned
wings
christ
jesus
let
me
wake
then
rattling
in
the
night
iron
visor
slips
in
rotting
mail
a
pale
kisses
my
loathing
lips
two
lusts
its
eyes
like
a
knife
that
flaming
seem
to
say
dream
dream
the
truth
of
life
the
eve
of
this
is
the
tale
they
tell
of
an
this
is
the
thing
that
befell
me
and
the
village
belle
beautiful
aimee
dean
did
i
love
her
god
and
she
they
know
and
i
and
love
was
the
life
of
me
whatever
else
may
be
would
god
that
i
could
die
that
eve
was
dim
the
frost
lay
white
under
strange
stars
and
a
slim
moon
in
the
graveyard
grim
an
autumn
ghost
of
light
they
told
her
go
alone
with
never
a
word
to
the
burial
plot
unknown
grave
with
the
grayest
stone
when
the
clock
on
twelve
is
heard
three
times
around
it
pass
with
never
a
sound
each
time
a
wisp
of
grass
and
myrtle
pluck
and
pass
out
of
the
ghostly
ground
and
the
bridegroom
that
to
be
at
smiling
wait
with
a
face
like
mist
to
see
with
graceful
gallantry
will
bow
you
to
the
gate
she
laughed
at
this
and
so
bespoke
us
how
to
the
burial
place
she
go
and
i
was
glad
to
know
for
i
be
there
to
bow
an
acre
from
the
farm
the
homestead
graves
lay
walled
from
sun
and
storm
old
cedars
of
priestly
form
around
like
sentinel
slaves
i
loved
but
never
could
say
such
words
to
her
and
waited
from
day
to
day
nursing
the
hope
that
lay
under
the
doubts
that
she
passed
the
iron
arch
of
the
legended
ground
and
the
moon
like
a
twisted
torch
burned
over
one
lonesome
larch
she
passed
with
never
a
sound
three
times
had
the
circle
traced
three
times
had
bent
to
the
grave
that
the
myrtle
graced
three
times
then
softly
faced
homeward
and
slowly
went
had
the
moonlight
changed
me
so
or
fear
undone
her
stepping
strange
and
slow
did
she
see
and
did
not
know
or
loved
she
another
one
who
knows
she
turned
to
flee
with
a
face
so
white
that
it
haunts
and
will
haunt
me
the
wind
blew
gustily
the
graveyard
gate
clanged
tight
did
she
think
it
me
or
what
clutching
her
dress
her
face
so
pinched
that
not
a
star
in
a
stormy
spot
shows
half
as
much
distress
did
i
speak
did
she
answer
aught
o
god
had
i
said
aimee
is
i
but
naught
and
the
mist
and
the
moon
distraught
stared
with
me
on
her
dead
this
is
the
tale
they
tell
of
the
this
is
the
thing
that
befell
me
and
the
village
belle
beautiful
aimee
dean
mater
dolorosa
the
nuns
sing
pro
the
lancets
glitter
above
and
the
beautiful
virgin
whose
robe
is
woven
of
infinite
love
infinite
love
and
sorrow
prays
for
them
there
on
high
who
has
most
need
of
her
prayers
shall
tell
them
they
or
i
up
in
the
hills
together
we
loved
where
the
world
seemed
true
our
world
of
the
whin
and
heather
our
skies
of
a
nearer
blue
a
blue
from
which
one
borrows
a
faith
that
helps
one
die
o
mother
sweet
mother
of
sorrows
none
needs
such
more
than
i
we
lived
we
loved
unwedded
love
sin
and
its
shame
that
slays
no
ill
of
the
year
we
dreaded
no
day
of
its
coming
days
its
coming
days
their
many
trials
by
morn
and
night
and
i
know
no
land
not
any
where
love
lilies
grow
so
white
was
he
false
to
me
my
mother
or
i
to
him
my
god
who
gave
thee
right
o
brother
to
take
god
right
and
rod
god
rod
of
avenging
morrows
and
the
life
here
in
my
side
o
mother
god
mother
of
sorrows
for
both
i
would
have
died
by
the
wall
of
the
chantry
kneeling
i
pray
and
the
organ
rings
gloria
pealing
sings
they
will
find
us
dead
by
the
wall
of
their
nunnery
o
mother
sweet
mother
of
sorrow
his
unborn
babe
and
me
the
old
inn
from
the
sleepy
town
one
takes
the
lone
forgotten
lane
straight
through
the
hills
a
brown
bubbles
in
sweet
with
rain
light
shivers
sink
the
gleaming
grain
the
cautious
drip
of
higher
leaves
the
lower
dips
that
drip
above
the
tangled
tops
it
heaves
its
gables
and
its
haunted
eaves
one
creeper
gnarled
to
bloomlessness
all
its
eastern
wall
the
sighing
cedars
rake
and
press
dark
boughs
along
the
panes
they
sprawl
while
where
the
sun
beats
breaks
a
drawl
of
hiving
wasps
one
bushy
bee
hurls
along
the
hall
to
hum
into
a
to
me
the
shadows
seem
too
scared
to
flee
of
ragged
chimneys
martins
make
huge
pipes
of
music
twittering
here
build
breed
and
my
footfalls
wake
strange
stealing
echoes
till
i
fear
i
meet
my
pale
self
coming
near
my
phantom
face
as
in
a
glass
or
one
men
murdered
buried
where
dim
in
gray
stealthy
glimmer
pass
with
lips
that
seem
to
moan
alas
last
days
aye
heartbreak
of
the
tattered
hills
and
mourning
of
the
raining
sky
heartbreak
and
mourning
since
god
wills
are
mine
and
god
knows
why
the
brutal
wind
that
herds
the
storm
in
clouds
that
freeze
along
as
this
gray
heart
are
doubly
warm
with
thrice
the
joy
of
song
i
held
one
dearer
than
each
day
of
life
god
sets
in
limpid
gold
what
thief
hath
stole
that
gem
away
to
leave
me
poor
and
old
the
heartbreak
of
the
hills
be
mine
of
trampled
twig
and
mired
leaf
of
rain
that
sobs
through
thorn
and
pine
an
unavailing
grief
the
sorrow
of
the
childless
long
said
yet
never
said
as
when
i
kissed
my
child
blue
eyes
and
lips
and
dead
the
romanza
in
a
kingdom
of
mist
and
moonlight
or
ever
the
world
was
known
past
leagues
of
unsailed
water
there
reigned
a
king
with
a
daughter
that
shone
like
a
starry
stone
the
day
grew
out
o
the
moonlight
but
never
a
day
was
there
the
king
was
wise
as
hoary
and
his
daughter
like
the
glory
of
seven
kingdoms
fair
and
the
night
dimmed
over
the
moonlight
and
ever
the
mist
was
gray
with
slips
of
dull
stars
bluer
where
the
princess
met
her
wooer
a
page
like
the
month
o
may
in
her
eyes
the
mist
and
the
moonlight
in
hair
of
a
crumpled
gold
by
day
they
wooed
laughed
the
good
white
king
and
old
on
the
sea
the
mist
and
the
moonlight
poured
pale
to
the
lilies
tips
at
eve
when
the
hawks
were
feeding
in
courts
to
the
kennels
leading
he
kissed
her
mouth
and
lips
on
towers
the
mist
and
the
moonlight
on
a
dead
face
staring
up
his
kingly
couch
was
ready
but
and
her
hand
was
steady
giving
the
poisoned
cup
my
romance
if
it
so
befalls
that
the
midnight
hovers
in
mist
no
moonlight
breaks
the
leagues
of
years
my
spirit
covers
and
myself
myself
forsakes
and
i
live
in
a
land
of
stars
and
flowers
white
cliffs
by
a
silver
sea
and
the
pearly
points
of
her
opal
towers
from
the
mountains
beckon
me
and
i
think
that
i
know
that
i
hear
her
calling
from
a
casement
bathed
with
light
the
music
of
waters
in
waters
falling
to
palms
from
a
rocky
height
and
i
feel
that
i
think
my
love
awaited
by
the
romance
of
her
charms
that
her
feet
are
early
and
mine
belated
in
a
world
that
chains
my
arms
but
i
break
my
chains
and
the
rest
is
easy
in
the
shadow
of
the
rose
that
blooms
in
her
garden
breezy
we
meet
and
no
one
knows
to
dream
sweet
dreams
and
kiss
sweet
kisses
the
world
it
may
live
or
die
the
world
that
forgets
the
soul
that
misses
the
life
that
has
long
gone
by
we
speak
old
vows
that
have
long
been
spoken
and
weep
a
woe
for
you
must
know
our
hearts
were
broken
hundreds
of
years
ago
the
epic
to
arms
the
battle
bugles
blew
the
daughter
of
their
earl
was
she
lord
of
a
thousand
swords
and
true
he
but
a
squire
of
low
degree
the
horns
of
war
blew
up
to
horse
he
kissed
her
mouth
her
face
was
white
god
grant
they
bear
thee
back
no
corse
god
give
i
win
my
spurs
each
blazing
beacon
scarred
a
in
the
wounded
dark
she
heard
knights
gallop
battleward
and
from
the
turret
leaned
to
mark
my
god
deliver
me
and
mine
my
child
my
god
all
night
she
prayed
she
saw
the
battle
beacons
shine
she
saw
the
battle
beacons
fade
they
brought
him
on
a
bier
of
for
him
the
spurs
and
name
for
her
the
sting
of
secret
tears
and
convent
walls
to
hide
her
shame
the
blind
harper
and
thus
it
came
my
feet
were
led
to
wizard
walls
that
hairy
hung
old
as
their
rock
the
moss
made
dead
and
like
a
ditch
of
fire
flung
around
it
uncouth
flowers
red
thrust
spur
and
fang
and
tongue
and
here
i
harped
did
dead
men
list
or
was
it
hollow
hinges
gnarred
huge
iron
scorn
in
and
when
i
thought
a
face
would
curse
me
lo
a
woman
kissed
at
me
hands
ringed
and
starred
and
so
i
sang
for
she
had
leaned
rare
beauty
to
me
dark
and
tall
i
sang
of
love
whose
court
is
queened
of
aliénor
the
virginal
nor
saw
how
rolled
on
me
a
fiend
from
the
wall
oh
how
i
sang
until
she
laughed
red
lips
that
made
lute
harmony
i
sang
of
knights
who
fought
and
quaffed
to
love
own
paragon
marie
nor
saw
the
suzerain
whose
shaft
was
bowed
and
bent
on
me
and
i
had
harped
until
she
wept
but
when
i
sang
of
ermengarde
of
anjou
where
her
court
is
kept
by
brave
by
beauty
and
by
bard
she
turned
a
raven
there
and
swept
me
like
a
fury
a
bleeding
beak
had
pierced
my
sight
a
crimson
claw
each
cheek
had
lined
one
glimpse
wild
walls
of
threatening
night
heaped
raven
battlements
behind
a
moat
of
blazing
serpents
bright
and
then
i
wandered
blind
elphin
the
eve
was
a
burning
copper
the
night
was
a
boundless
black
where
wells
of
the
lightning
crumbled
and
boiled
with
blazing
rack
when
i
came
to
the
castle
with
the
wild
rain
on
my
back
thrice
under
its
goblin
towers
where
the
causey
of
rock
was
laid
thrice
there
at
its
spider
portal
my
scornful
bugle
brayed
but
never
a
warder
questioned
an
owl
was
the
answer
made
when
the
heaven
above
was
blistered
one
scald
of
blinding
storm
and
the
blackness
clanged
like
a
cavern
of
iron
where
demons
swarm
i
rode
in
the
court
of
the
castle
with
the
shield
upon
my
arm
my
sword
unsheathed
and
certain
of
the
visor
of
my
casque
my
steel
steps
challenged
the
donjon
my
gauntlet
should
unmask
but
never
a
knight
or
varlet
to
stay
or
slay
or
ask
my
heels
on
the
stone
ground
iron
my
fists
on
the
bolts
clashed
steel
in
the
hall
the
roar
of
the
torrent
in
the
turret
the
thunder
peal
and
i
found
her
there
in
the
turret
alone
by
her
she
spun
the
flax
of
a
spindle
and
i
wondered
on
her
face
she
spun
the
flax
of
a
spindle
and
i
marvelled
on
her
grace
she
spun
the
flax
of
a
spindle
and
i
watched
a
little
space
but
nerves
of
my
manhood
weakened
the
heart
in
my
breast
was
wax
myself
but
the
hide
of
an
image
with
the
hards
of
flax
she
spun
and
she
smiled
a
spindle
of
flax
she
spun
and
she
laughed
the
blood
of
my
veins
in
a
skein
but
i
knew
how
the
charm
was
mastered
and
snapped
in
the
hissing
vein
so
she
wove
but
a
fiery
scorpion
that
writhed
from
her
hands
again
fleeing
in
rain
and
in
tempest
saw
by
the
cataract
bed
cancers
of
ulcerous
fire
wounds
of
a
bloody
red
its
windows
glare
in
the
darkness
eyes
of
a
dragon
head
she
bewitched
me
in
my
childhood
and
the
witch
charm
is
hidden
far
beyond
the
wicked
wildwood
i
shall
find
it
i
am
bidden
she
commands
me
she
who
bound
me
with
soft
sorcery
to
follow
in
a
golden
snare
who
wound
me
to
her
bosom
snowy
hollow
comes
a
stallion
sired
of
the
wind
a
mare
his
mother
whom
thessalian
madness
fired
and
the
hurricane
his
brother
then
my
soul
delays
no
longer
though
the
night
around
is
scowling
keenly
mount
him
blacker
stronger
than
the
tempest
that
is
howling
at
our
ears
wild
shadows
whistle
brazen
forks
the
lightning
us
flames
and
huge
the
thunder
missile
bursts
behind
us
drags
before
us
over
fields
of
stubble
iron
forests
dark
with
wonder
evil
marshes
black
with
trouble
nightmare
torrents
thundering
under
in
the
thorn
that
past
us
races
harelipped
hags
like
crows
are
rocking
stunted
oaks
have
faces
gnarled
that
leer
an
impish
mocking
rocks
in
which
the
storm
is
hooting
thrust
a
humpbacked
murder
over
bristling
heaths
dead
thistles
shooting
gibbets
cover
each
and
all
are
passed
like
water
into
a
cavern
till
we
see
the
devil
daughter
waiting
at
the
devil
tavern
and
we
stay
i
drain
the
beaker
in
her
hand
the
draught
is
fire
grow
weaker
and
my
spirit
one
desire
course
it
course
it
darkness
passes
like
an
uprolled
banner
tattered
walled
before
us
mountain
masses
rise
like
centuries
unscattered
and
the
storm
flies
ragged
slowly
comes
a
moon
of
and
the
evil
night
grows
holy
mists
the
wild
ride
growing
duller
in
the
round
moon
angry
scanning
cross
spider
arches
of
the
bridges
spanning
chasms
of
her
kingdom
marches
we
have
reached
her
kingdom
olden
as
the
sea
that
sighs
its
sadness
rocks
and
trees
and
sands
are
golden
and
the
air
a
golden
gladness
shapely
ingots
are
the
flowers
and
the
waters
amber
brightness
in
the
bowers
sing
with
eyes
of
diamond
whiteness
and
she
meets
me
with
a
chalice
like
the
giamschid
ruby
burning
and
i
drain
it
without
malice
to
her
towers
of
topaz
turning
many
hundred
years
forgetting
all
that
earth
within
her
power
i
possess
her
naught
regretting
since
each
year
is
as
an
hour
at
the
stile
young
harry
leapt
over
the
stile
and
kissed
her
over
the
stile
the
stars
he
thought
it
was
mary
was
mary
sister
and
love
hath
a
way
of
thinking
thy
pail
sweetheart
i
will
take
and
carry
over
the
stile
the
stars
hang
just
to
the
spring
my
sweetheart
harry
and
love
is
a
heartless
fellow
thou
saidst
me
when
the
frost
did
shower
over
the
stile
from
stars
i
say
thee
now
the
flower
and
love
is
taker
and
giver
o
false
thou
art
false
to
me
sweetheart
over
the
stile
the
stars
to
thee
the
stars
and
myself
sweetheart
i
never
was
aught
save
mary
sister
sweet
mary
sister
and
thou
my
harry
her
harry
and
mine
but
mine
the
weeping
in
a
month
or
twain
you
two
will
marry
and
i
in
my
grave
be
sleeping
alone
among
the
meadows
of
millet
over
the
stile
the
stars
pursuing
some
tears
in
her
pail
as
she
stoops
to
fill
it
and
love
hath
a
way
of
doing
the
alcalde
daughter
the
times
they
had
kissed
and
parted
that
night
were
over
a
score
each
time
that
the
cavalier
started
each
time
she
would
swear
him
thou
art
going
to
barcelona
to
make
naxera
thy
bride
seduce
the
lady
yöna
and
thy
lips
have
lied
have
lied
i
love
thee
i
love
thee
thou
knowest
and
thou
shalt
not
give
away
the
love
to
my
life
thou
owest
and
my
heart
commands
thee
stay
i
say
thou
hast
lied
and
liest
for
where
is
there
war
in
the
state
thou
goest
by
heaven
the
highest
to
choose
thee
a
fairer
mate
wilt
thou
go
to
barcelona
when
thy
queen
in
toledo
is
to
wait
on
the
haughty
yöna
when
thou
hast
these
lips
to
kiss
and
they
stood
in
the
balcony
over
the
old
toledo
square
and
weeping
she
took
for
her
lover
a
red
rose
out
of
her
hair
and
they
kissed
farewell
and
higher
the
moon
made
amber
the
air
and
she
drew
for
the
traitor
and
liar
a
stiletto
out
of
her
hair
when
the
lounged
through
the
quiet
with
the
stir
of
halberds
and
swords
not
a
bravo
was
there
to
defy
it
not
a
gallant
to
brave
with
words
one
man
at
the
corner
turning
quite
dead
and
they
stoop
or
stand
in
his
heart
a
dagger
burning
and
a
red
rose
crushed
in
his
hand
at
the
corregidor
to
don
odora
says
donna
de
vine
i
yield
to
thy
long
endeavor
at
my
balcony
be
on
the
stroke
of
nine
and
signor
am
thine
forever
this
beauty
but
once
had
the
don
descried
as
she
quit
the
confessional
followed
what
a
foot
for
silk
a
face
for
a
bride
hem
the
rest
odora
swallowed
and
with
vows
as
soft
as
his
oaths
were
sweet
her
heart
he
barricaded
and
pressed
this
point
with
a
present
meet
and
that
point
serenaded
what
else
could
the
enemy
do
but
yield
to
a
handsome
importuning
a
gallant
blade
with
a
lute
for
shield
all
night
at
her
lattice
mooning
es
estrella
o
lily
of
girls
here
that
for
thy
fierce
duenna
a
purse
of
pistoles
and
a
rosary
o
pearls
and
gold
as
yellow
as
henna
she
will
drop
from
thy
balcony
rail
my
sweet
my
seraph
this
silken
ladder
and
then
sweet
then
my
soul
at
thy
feet
no
lover
of
lovers
gladder
and
the
end
of
it
was
but
i
will
not
say
how
he
won
to
the
room
of
the
lady
ah
to
love
is
life
and
to
live
is
gay
for
the
rest
a
maravedi
now
comes
her
betrothed
from
the
wars
and
he
a
count
of
the
court
castilian
a
don
diabolus
sword
at
knee
and
moustaches
uncivilian
and
his
is
a
jealous
love
and
for
he
marks
that
this
marriage
makes
sadder
he
watches
and
sees
a
robber
to
her
or
gallant
ascend
a
ladder
so
he
pushes
inquiry
unto
her
room
with
his
naked
sword
demanding
an
alquazil
with
the
face
of
doom
sure
of
a
stout
withstanding
and
weapon
to
weapon
they
foined
and
fought

thrusts
were
vicious
three
thrusts
to
the
floor
odora
had
brought
a
fourth

through
the
offered
bosom
of
donna

this
is
the
count
condition
was
he

the
question
is
mine
to
judge
for
the
inquisition
the

some
quaint
nürnberg
uprummaged

and
where
was
never
clear
nor

how
he

of

that
held
him
as
with

considered
and
decided
on

way
once
when
eddetma
with

houri
band
of

under

guard
in

took
her

under

where

in

a

mid

bent
spreading

amulets
of
hollow
gold
sweet
with
imprisoned
ambergris
and
musk
symbolic
stones
in
sorcerous
carcanets
in
cabalistic
gold
whereon
the
princess
marvelled
and
bade
ask
what
did
the
elder
with
his
riches
there
who
questioned
mumbled
in
his
bushy
beard
to
buy
a
wife
withal
whereat
they
laughed
as
oafs
when
wisdom
stumbles
quoth
a
maid
with
orient
midnight
in
her
starry
eyes
and
tropic
music
on
her
languid
tongue
and
what
if
i
should
wed
with
thee
o
beard
grayer
than
my
what
then
one
kiss
no
more
and
child
thou
wert
divorced
he
and
the
humor
took
them
till
the
birds
that
listened
in
the
and
the
plane
sang
gayly
of
the
and
his
kiss
then
quoth
the
princess
thou
wilt
wed
with
him
ansada
mirth
in
her
two
eyes
gazelles
and
gravity
in
her
speech
and
took
ansada
hand
and
laid
it
in
the
old
man
staggering
hand
and
he
unbent
thin
wrinkled
brows
and
on
his
staff
arose
weighed
with
the
weight
of
many
heavy
years
and
kissed
her
leaning
on
his
shaking
staff
and
heaped
her
bosom
with
an
amir
wealth
and
left
them
laughing
at
his
foolish
beard
now
on
the
next
day
as
she
took
her
ease
with
her
glad
troop
of
girlhood
maidens
who
so
many
royal
tulips
seemed
behold
bowed
with
white
years
upon
a
flowery
sward
the
ancient
with
new
jewelry
and
gems
wherefrom
the
sun
coaxed
wizard
fires
and
lit
glimmers
in
glowing
green
and
pendent
pearl
ultramarine
and
beaded
vivid
rose
and
so
they
stood
to
wonder
and
one
asked
as
yesternoon
wherefore
the
father
there
displayed
his
sheikh
locks
and
the
genie
gems
another
marriage
and
another
kiss
what
doth
the
court
his
youth
again
o
aged
libertine
in
wish
not
deed
o
prodigal
of
wives
as
well
as
wealth
here
stands
thy
damsel
trilled
the
diarra
with
the
raven
in
her
hair
two
blowing
in
her
cheeks
and
took
the
dotard
jewels
with
the
kiss
in
merry
mockery
ere
the
morrow
dawn
bethought
eddetma
shall
my
handmaidens
teasing
a
whim
to
wrinkled
smiles
for
withered
kisses
still
divide
his
wealth
while
i
stand
idle
lose
the
caravan
whose
least
is
notable
my
right
and
mine
betide
me
what
and
with
the
morn
before
the
man
for
privily
she
came
stood
habited
as
of
her
in
humble
raiment
now
the
ancient
saw
and
knew
her
for
the
princess
that
she
was
and
kindling
gladness
of
the
knowledge
made
two
sparkling
forges
of
his
deep
dark
eyes
beneath
the
ashes
of
his
priestly
brows
not
timidly
she
came
but
coy
approach
became
the
maiden
of
eddetma
suite
and
humbly
answered
he
all
my
old
heart
responsive
to
her
quavering
request
the
daughter
of
the
king
did
give
thee
leave
and
thou
wouldst
well
then
wed
with
me
thy
hand
thy
lips
so
he
arose
and
gave
her
of
barbaric
jewelry
and
gems
and
seized
her
hand
and
from
her
lips
the
kiss
when
from
his
age
behold
the
dotage
fell
and
from
the
man
all
palsied
hoariness
and
amorous
with
youth
a
god
in
ardent
capabilities
resistless
held
her
and
she
swooning
saw
gloating
the
branded
brow
of
prince
behram
the
khalif
and
the
arab
among
the
tales
wherein
it
hath
been
told
in
golden
letters
in
a
book
of
gold
of
hatim
taï
hospitality
who
substanceless
in
death
and
shadowy
made
men
his
guests
upon
that
mountain
top
whereon
his
tomb
grayed
from
a
thistle
crop
a
tomb
of
rock
where
women
hewn
of
stone
rude
figures
spread
dishevelled
hair
whose
moan
from
dark
to
daybreak
made
the
silence
cry
the
camel
drivers
being
tented
nigh
ghouls

hyenas
shuddering
would

builded

power
out

had
read

to
his

said

the

and
the

may
despise
knowing
no

the

lost
in

among
such
tales

is
recorded
of
an
arab
youth
the
khalif
hisham
ben
abdulmelik
hunting
one
day
by
some
unwonted
freak
rode
parted
from

retinue
and
gave
chase
to
an
antelope
without

amir
or
vizier
to
a
pasture
place
of
sheep
he
came
where
dark
in
tattered
grace
watched
one
an
arab
youth
and
as
it
came
the
antelope
drew
off
with
mouth
of
flame
and
tongue
of
fire
to
the

he
turned
shouting

so
the

him
instant
of

waited
with

in

unquestioning
went
chin
bowed
on
breast
and
on
his
feet
a
bent
dark
gaze
of
scornful
freedom
unafraid
till
at
the
khalif

his
steps
were
staid

unsaluting
standing

held
down
an

with

the

then
o

if
my

be
stretched
again
unscissored
of
what

ordain
little

thy

give

then
the

o

one
of

wilt
thou
not

bandying
thy

with
the

upon

there

some
have

absurd

each

ho
his

see
canst
thou

well
so
where
the
arab
stood
bound
him
made
kneel
upon
the
cloth
of
blood
with
curving
sword
the
headsman
leaned
at
pause
and
even
as
is
custom
made
of
laws
to
the
descendant
of
the
prophet
quoth
o
khalif
shall
i
strike
by
iblis
oath
strike
answered
hisham
but
again
the
slave
questioned
and
yet
again
the
khalif
gave
his
nodded
yea
and
for
the
third
time
then
he
asked
and
knowing
neither
men
nor
jinn
might
save
him
if
the
khalif
spake
assent
signalled
the
sword
the
youth
with
body
bent
laughed
till
the
of
each
jaw
appeared
laughed
as
with
scorn
the
king
of
kings
he
beard
insulting
death
so
with
redoubled
spleen
roared
hisham
rising
it
is
truly
seen
that
thou
art
mad
who
mockest
azrael
the
arab
answered
listen
once
befell
commander
of
the
faithful
that
a
hawk
a
hungry
hawk
pounced
on
a
and
winging
nestward
with
his
meal
in
claw
to
him
the
sparrow
for
the
creature
saw
the
hawk
conceit
addressed
this
slyly
most
great
most
royal
there
is
not
i
know
that
in
me
which
will
stay
thy
stomach
stress
i
am
too
paltry
for
thy
mightiness
with
which
the
hawk
was
pleased
and
flattered
so
in
his
he
let
the
sparrow
go
then
smiled
the
khalif
hisham
and
a
sign
staying
the
scimitar
that
hung
malign
a
threatening
crescent
said
god
bless
preserve
the
prophet
whom
all
true
believers
serve
now
by
my
kinship
to
the
prophet
and
had
he
at
first
but
spake
us
thus
this
hand
had
been
reckless
and
instead
of
hate
he
had
had
all
except
the
khalifate
bade
stuff
his
mouth
with
jewels
and
entreat
him
courteously
then
from
the
palace
beat
the
end
