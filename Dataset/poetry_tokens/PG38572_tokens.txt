love
sonnets
of
an
office
boy
oh
if
you
only
knowed
how
much
i
like
to
stand
here
when
the
old
man
ai
around
and
watch
your
soft
white
fingers
while
you
pound
away
at
them
there
keys
each
time
you
strike
it
almost
seems
to
me
as
though
you
found
some
way
while
writin
letters
how
to
play
sweet
music
on
that
thing
because
the
sound
is
something
i
could
listen
to
all
day
you
or
six
and
i
fourteen
and
you
do
hardly
ever
notice
me
but
when
you
do
you
call
me
willie
gee
i
wisht
i
bundles
of
the
old
long
green
and
could
be
or
nine
or
so
and
something
happened
to
your
other
beau
ii
i
heard
the
old
man
scoldin
yesterday
because
your
spellin
did
suit
him
quite
he
said
you
better
go
to
school
at
night
and
you
was
rattled
when
he
turned
away
you
had
to
tear
the
letter
up
and
write
it
all
again
and
when
nobody
seen
i
went
and
dented
in
his
hat
for
spite
that
what
he
got
for
treatin
you
so
mean
i
wish
that
you
typewrote
for
me
and
we
was
far
off
on
an
island
all
alone
i
fix
a
place
up
under
some
nice
tree
and
every
time
your
fingers
struck
a
key
i
grab
your
hands
and
hold
them
in
my
own
and
any
way
you
spelt
would
do
for
me
illustration
iii
i
wish
a
fire
start
up
here
some
day
and
all
the
rest
would
run
away
from
you
the
boss
and
that
bookkeeper
too
that
you
keep
smilin
at
and
after
they
was
all
you
holler
out
and
say
wo
no
one
come
and
save
me
must
i
choke
and
die
alone
here
in
the
heat
and
smoke
oh
cowards
that
they
was
to
run
away
and
then
i
come
and
grab
you
up
and
go
out
through
the
hall
and
down
the
stairs
and
when
i
got
you
saved
the
crowd
would
cheer
and
then
they
take
me
to
the
hospital
and
so
you
come
and
stay
beside
me
there
and
cry
and
say
you
hate
to
live
if
i
would
die
illustration
iv
yesterday
i
stood
behind
your
chair
when
you
was
kind
of
bendin
down
to
write
and
i
could
see
your
neck
so
soft
and
white
and
notice
where
the
poker
singed
your
hair
and
then
you
looked
around
and
seen
me
there
and
kind
of
smiled
and
i
could
seem
to
feel
a
sudden
empty
sinkish
feelin
where
i
all
filled
up
when
i
just
a
meal
dear
frankie
where
your
soft
sweet
finger
tips
hit
on
the
keys
i
often
touch
my
lips
and
wunst
i
kissed
your
little
overshoe
and
i
have
got
a
hairpin
that
you
wore
one
day
i
found
it
on
the
office
floor
i
throw
my
job
up
if
they
fired
you
she
got
a
dimple
in
her
chin
and
oh
how
soft
and
smooth
it
looks
her
eyes
are
blue
the
red
seems
always
tryin
to
peep
through
the
middle
of
her
cheeks
i
like
to
go
and
lay
my
face
up
next
to
hers
and
throw
my
arms
around
her
neck
with
just
us
two
alone
together
but
not
carin
who
might
scold
if
they
should
see
us
actin
so
if
i
would
know
that
some
poor
girl
loved
me
as
much
as
i
do
her
sometimes
i
take
her
in
my
arms
a
little
while
and
make
her
happy
just
for
kindness
and
to
see
the
pleased
look
that
acrost
her
face
break
and
hear
the
sighs
that
showed
how
glad
she
be
vi
when
you
typewritin
and
that
clerk
tips
back
there
on
his
chair
and
smiles
at
you
and
you
look
up
and
get
to
smilin
too
i
like
to
go
and
give
his
chair
a
jerk
and
send
him
flyin
till
his
head
went
through
the
door
that
goes
out
to
the
hall
and
when
they
picked
him
up
he
be
all
black
and
blue
and
you
be
nearly
busted
laughin
then
but
if
i
done
it
maybe
you
would
run
and
hold
his
head
and
smooth
his
hair
and
say
it
made
you
sad
that
he
got
dumped
that
way
and
i
get
out
for
what
i
done
i
wish
that
he
get
fired
and
you
stay
and
suddenly
i
be
a
man
some
day
illustration
vii
if
i
was
grown
to
be
a
man
and
you
and
all
the
others
that
are
workin
here
was
always
under
me
and
i
could
clear
the
place
if
i
wanted
to
i
buy
an
easy
chair
all
nice
and
new
and
get
a
bird
to
sing
above
your
head
and
let
you
set
and
rest
all
day
instead
of
hammerin
them
keys
the
way
you
do
i
bounce
that
clerk
and
then
i
raise
your
wages
and
move
up
my
desk
beside
where
you
be
settin
restin
there
and
not
care
about
the
weather
all
the
days
would
make
me
glad
and
in
the
evenings
then
i
was
time
to
start
to
work
again
illustration
viii
this
morning
when
that
homely
clerk
come
in
he
had
a
rose
he
got
somewhere
he
went
and
kind
of
leaned
against
her
chair
instead
of
goin
on
about
his
work
and
stood
around
and
talked
to
her
awhile
because
the
boss
was
out
and
both
took
care
to
watch
the
door
and
when
he
left
her
there
he
dropped
the
flower
with
a
sickish
smile
i
snuck
it
from
the
glass
of
water
she
had
stuck
it
in
and
tore
it
up
and
put
it
on
the
floor
and
smashed
it
with
my
foot
when
neither
him
nor
her
was
watchin
me
i
like
to
rub
the
stem
acrost
his
nose
and
i
wish
they
never
be
another
rose
ix
yesterday
i
watched
you
when
you
set
there
with
your
little
in
your
lap
i
seen
you
nibble
at
a
ginger
snap
and
wished
that
where
your
lips
had
made
it
wet
i
have
a
chance
to
take
a
bite
and
let
my
mouth
be
right
where
yours
was
before
and
after
you
had
got
your
apple
and
was
lookin
i
picked
up
the
core
i
pressed
my
mouth
against
it
then
and
so
it
seemed
almost
the
same
as
kissin
you
your
teeth
had
touched
it
and
your
red
lips
too
and
it
was
good
and
tasted
sweet
and
oh
i
wished
you
bring
an
apple
every
day
and
i
could
have
the
cores
you
throw
away
i
wish
when
you
was
through
your
work
some
night
and
goin
home
alone
and
had
your
pay
stuck
in
your
stockin
what
you
drew
that
day
a
robber
come
along
with
all
his
might
and
you
be
nearly
scared
to
death
and
right
there
in
the
street
you
almost
faint
and
say
good
robber
please
do
hurt
me
go
away
and
as
he
grabbed
you
then
i
come
in
sight
i
wish
i
be
as
strong
as
two
or
three
big
giants
then
and
when
i
handed
one
out
to
him
he
be
through
all
in
and
done
and
then
you
look
and
see
that
it
was
me
and
thinkin
of
the
great
escape
you
had
you
snuggle
in
my
arms
and
just
be
glad
illustration
xi
her
brother
come
this
morning
with
a
note
what
said
that
she
was
home
and
sick
in
bed
she
got
an
awful
bad
cold
in
her
head
they
think
it
might
run
into
the
sore
throat
and
oh
what
if
she
not
come
back
again
and
they
would
get
some
other
girl
instead
of
her
to
typewrite
here
and
she
be
dead
i
would
care
no
more
for
nothin
then
i
wish
i
was
the
doctor
that
they
get
and
when
i
take
her
pulse
i
hold
her
hand
and
say
poor
little
girl
to
her
and
set
beside
the
bed
awhile
and
kind
of
let
my
arm
go
her
slow
and
careful
and
say
now
put
out
your
tongue
a
little
pet
xii
she
back
to
work
again
i
awful
glad
when
she
was
sick
it
seemed
to
me
as
though
the
clocks
all
got
to
goin
kind
of
slow
and
every
key
she
pounds
looked
kind
of
sad
it
tough
to
have
to
hear
her
coughin
so
i
wish
that
i
could
take
her
cold
and
she
would
know
i
took
it
and
not
have
to
blow
her
nose
no
more
and
be
as
well
as
me
she
takes
some
kind
of
cough
stuff
in
a
spoon
i
seen
her
lickin
it
this
morning
when
she
took
a
dose
and
put
it
down
again
and
when
the
rest
went
out
awhile
at
noon
i
got
her
spoon
and
licked
it
and
it
seemed
as
though
it
all
was
something
nice
i
dreamed
xiii
last
night
i
dreamed
about
her
in
my
sleep
i
thought
that
her
and
me
had
went
away
out
on
some
hill
where
birds
sung
all
day
and
i
had
got
a
job
of
herdin
sheep
i
thought
that
she
had
went
along
to
keep
me
and
we
set
around
for
hours
just
lovin
and
i
go
and
gather
flowers
and
pile
them
at
her
feet
all
in
a
heap
it
seemed
to
me
like
heaven
bein
there
with
only
her
besides
the
sheep
and
birds
and
us
not
sayin
anything
but
words
about
the
way
we
loved
i
would
care
to
ever
wake
again
if
i
could
still
dream
we
was
there
forever
on
the
hill
illustration
xiv
this
morning
when
we
come
to
work
i
got
jammed
in
the
elevator
back
of
you
and
there
they
made
you
stick
your
elbow
in
me
where
the
mince
pie
lands
the
lunch
that
i
had
brought
was
all
smashed
flat
but
still
i
did
care
you
leaned
against
me
for
you
could
stand
because
the
ones
in
front
were
crowdin
and
my
nose
was
pressed
deep
into
your
back
hair
i
wish
we
had
to
go
ten
times
as
high
or
else
that
we
be
shootin
upward
yet
and
never
stop
no
more
until
we
get
away
above
the
clouds
and
in
the
sky
and
you
lean
back
forevermore
and
let
your
hairpins
always
jab
me
in
the
eye
xv
when
her
and
me
were
here
alone
at
noon
and
she
had
bit
a
pickle
square
in
two
i
set
and
watched
and
listened
to
her
chew
and
thought
how
sweet
she
was
and
pretty
soon
she
happened
to
look
down
at
me
and
say
you
seem
so
sad
poor
boy
what
wrong
with
you
and
then
i
got
to
shiverin
all
through
and
wished
that
i
was
forty
miles
away
i
tried
to
think
of
some
excuse
to
make
but
something
seemed
all
whirly
in
my
head
and
so
the
first
blame
thing
i
knew
i
said
it
nothin
only
just
the
stummick
ache
sometimes
i
almost
wisht
that
i
was
dead
for
settin
there
and
makin
such
a
break
xvi
last
night
i
heard
jones
astin
you
to
go
to
see
the
opery
next
thursday
night
and
you
said
yes
and
he
be
settin
right
beside
you
there
all
through
the
whole
blamed
show
and
you
be
touchin
him
with
your
elbow
and
mebby
he
say
things
that
tickle
you
and
buy
a
box
of
for
you
too
and
i
not
be
around
nor
never
know
i
wish
i
be
the
hero
on
the
stage
and
you
was
the
fair
maiden
that
got
stoled
and
he
would
be
the
villain
that
would
hold
you
frettin
like
a
in
its
cage
and
then
i
come
along
and
smash
him
one
and
you
say
take
me
dear
for
what
you
done
illustration
xvii
when
i
was
dustin
off
her
desk
one
day
and
she
was
standin
there
i
took
the
pad
she
writes
on
when
she
gets
dictates
and
had
a
notion
to
tear
off
a
leaf
and
lay
it
up
against
my
heart
at
night
when
they
was
something
made
her
come
to
where
i
stood
and
say
poor
boy
as
softly
as
she
could
it
almost
seemed
to
take
my
breath
away
that
night
i
could
sleep
at
all
becuz
the
thoughts
about
them
words
that
she
had
said
kep
all
the
time
through
my
head
with
thoughts
about
how
beautiful
she
wuz
and
then
i
knowed
she
loved
me
too
or
she
would
not
of
cared
how
hard
i
worked
you
see
xviii
i
like
to
have
a
lock
of
her
brown
hair
for
that
would
be
a
part
of
her
you
know
and
if
she
tie
it
with
a
little
bow
of
ribbon
then
i
fasten
it
somewhere
clear
down
inside
next
to
my
heart
to
wear
and
fix
it
over
every
week
or
so
when
i
changed
undershirts
or
maw
she
go
and
raise
a
fuss
because
she
found
it
there
one
day
when
bizness
was
on
the
boom
she
trimmed
her
and
one
piece
flew
to
where
i
was
almost
acrost
the
room
i
watched
the
spot
where
it
went
tumblin
to
and
now
a
piece
of
her
is
mine
it
come
right
from
the
end
of
her
dear
little
thumb
xix
i
wish
some
day
when
she
typewritin
and
i
took
a
note
out
for
the
boss
somewhere
they
be
some
outlaws
sneak
in
here
and
scare
that
clerk
to
death
and
then
the
band
would
steal
her
and
nobody
else
would
dare
to
try
to
save
her
and
they
run
away
to
where
they
had
their
cave
and
keep
her
there
and
ast
more
for
her
than
her
folks
could
pay
then
i
would
get
a
gun
and
and
take
the
name
of
buckskin
bob
or
joe
and
track
them
to
their
den
and
then
i
go
whoopin
in
and
save
her
life
and
she
would
say
my
hero
came
at
last
and
we
stand
there
and
hold
each
other
fast
illustration
xx
last
night
when
she
got
on
her
coat
and
hat
and
felt
her
dress
behind
and
then
her
hair
to
see
if
everything
was
all
right
there
she
stopped
and
said
well
now
just
look
at
that
and
then
put
out
one
foot
a
little
bit
and
says
ai
that
provokin
i
declare
the
string
untied
she
put
it
on
a
chair
for
me
to
fasten
it
so
then
that
clerk
he
pushed
me
back
and
grabbed
the
that
were
hangin
down
i
wish
i
was
the
strongest
man
in
town
oh
would
i
of
let
him
have
a
whack
and
i
of
kicked
him
so
blamed
hard
i
bet
he
wonder
what
he
might
come
down
on
yet
xxi
my
darling
often
when
you
set
and
think
of
things
that
seem
to
kind
of
bother
you
you
put
your
pencil
in
your
mouth
and
chew
around
the
wood
and
let
your
sweet
teeth
sink
down
in
it
till
it
all
marked
up
and
split
and
yesterday
i
seen
you
when
you
threw
a
stub
away
that
you
bit
up
it
flew
behind
the
bookcase
where
i
gobbled
it
i
put
it
in
my
mouth
the
way
you
done
and
i
could
feel
the
little
holes
you
made
the
places
where
your
teeth
sunk
in
i
laid
my
tongue
tight
up
against
them
every
one
and
shut
my
eyes
and
then
you
seemed
to
be
there
with
your
lips
on
mine
and
kissin
me
xxii
when
i
was
tellin
ma
two
days
ago
about
our
beautiful
typewriter
girl
she
dropped
the
dough
and
give
a
sudden
whirl
and
said
she
as
old
as
you
you
know
she
must
be
or
six
or
so
do
think
about
her
any
more
my
dear
and
you
and
me
be
always
happy
here
besides
she
nothing
but
an
old
scarecrow
it
made
me
sad
to
hear
her
talk
that
way
my
darling
just
a
little
girl
almost
i
ca
see
why
ma
give
her
such
a
roast
and
i
could
hardly
eat
my
lunch
next
day
for
every
time
i
took
a
bite
of
bread
i
almost
hated
ma
for
what
she
said
illustration
xxiii
the
other
day
a
rusty
pen
got
stuck
away
deep
in
her
finger
and
she
held
her
poor
dear
little
hand
up
then
and
yelled
for
me
to
hurry
over
there
and
suck
the
poison
out
and
when
i
went
i
struck
my
toe
against
the
old
man
cuspidor
and
rolled
about
eight
feet
along
the
floor
before
i
knew
what
happened
blame
the
luck
when
i
set
up
and
looked
around
at
last
that
homely
clerk
was
there
and
so
he
had
her
finger
in
his
mouth
and
oh
i
bet
you
i
kicked
him
if
i
dast
i
never
seen
the
beat
the
way
things
go
when
there
a
chance
for
me
to
stand
a
show
xxiv
that
homely
clerk
took
her
out
for
a
ride
last
sunday
in
a
buggy
and
they
rode
around
all
through
the
parks
i
wisht
i
knowed
about
it
and
the
horse
would
kind
of
shied
and
then
got
scared
and
run
and
kicked
and
of
been
a
piece
ahead
and
saw
him
jump
and
leave
her
hangin
on
alone
the
chump
and
she
of
been
so
she
nearly
died
then
i
of
give
a
spring
and
caught
the
bit
and
landed
on
the
horse
back
where
all
the
people
there
could
see
me
doin
it
and
when
i
got
her
saved
the
crowd
would
call
three
cheers
for
me
and
then
she
come
and
fall
against
my
buzzum
and
he
have
a
fit
xxv
i
do
care
if
she
as
old
as
me
for
i
been
figgerin
and
figgers
shows
that
i
grow
older
faster
than
she
grows
and
when
i
or
so
why
she
wo
be
near
as
old
as
me
no
more
and
then
almost
the
first
thing
that
she
knows
i
might
ketch
up
to
her
some
day
i
and
both
of
us
be
gladder
than
before
when
i
get
whiskers
i
can
let
them
grow
all
up
and
down
my
cheeks
and
on
my
chin
and
in
a
little
while
they
might
begin
to
make
me
look
as
old
as
her
and
so
she
snuggle
up
to
me
and
call
me
paw
and
then
i
call
her
pet
instead
of
maw

one
morning
when
the
boss
was
out
somewhere
and
when
the
clerk
was
at
the
bank
and
me
and
her
was
here
alone
together
she
let
out
a
screech
and
jumped
up
in
the
air
and
grabbed
her
skirts
and
yelled
a
mouse
and
there
one
come
right
at
her
and
gee
they
was
a
blame
thing
that
i
could
see
to
whack
it
with
except
an
office
chair
i
grabbed
one
up
and
made
a
smash
and
hit
her
desk
and
broke
a
leg
clear
off
somehow
and
when
the
boss
came
back
and
looked
at
it
he
said
that
i
would
have
to
pay
and
now
when
ma
finds
out
i
know
just
what
i
git
next
there
will
be
an
awful
row
xxvii
it
over
now
the
blow
has
fell
at
last
it
seems
as
though
the
sun
ca
shine
no
more
and
nothing
looks
the
way
it
did
before
the
glad
thoughts
that
i
used
to
think
are
past
her
desk
shut
up
the
lid
locked
fast
the
keys
where
she
typewrote
are
still
her
chair
looks
sad
and
lonesome
standin
empty
there
i
like
to
let
the
tears
come
if
i
dast
this
morning
when
the
boss
come
in
he
found
a
letter
that
he
got
from
her
and
so
he
read
it
over
twice
and
turned
around
and
said
the
little
fool
got
married
oh
it
seemed
as
if
i
sink
down
through
the
ground
and
never
peep
no
more
i
did
though
xxviii
the
chap
a
beau
we
did
know
she
had
he
come
from
out
of
town
somewhere
they
say
i
hope
he
awful
homely
and
that
they
will
fight
like
cats
and
dogs
and
both
be
sad
but
still
there
one
thing
makes
me
kind
of
glad
the
clerk
must
stay
and
work
away
and
though
he
keeps
pretendin
to
be
gay
it
plain
enough
to
see
he
feelin
bad

wish
when

rich

me
tall
and
handsome
