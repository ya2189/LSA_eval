for

quote
from
clinton
work
a
study
in
violet
next
to
the
rose
whose
divine
right
to
monarchy
can
not
be
questioned
the
violet
is
the
flower
no
other
is
mentioned
so
frequently
or
with
such
affection
it
is
impossible
to
say
when
this
familiar
flower
first
blossomed
in
literature
the
would
not
be
complete
without
it
nor
would
the
of
the
roman
singer
virgil
ovid
was
fond
of
horticulture
and
the
violet
was
not
forgotten
when
the
bard
was
inditing
his
hexameters
pliny
and
cicero
too
were
in
the
bible
there
is
no
mention
of
the
flower
but
in
occurs
perhaps
the
first
appearance
of
our
little
friend
in
christian
literature
affection
for
is
well
known
of
the
many
shakspearean
quotations
in
this
field
probably
the
most
familiar
comprises
the
exquisite
lines
dim
but
sweeter
than
the
lids
of
eyes
or
passing
to
the
more
recent
literary
period
the
individual
taste
of
the
poet
becomes
noticeable
strange
to
relate
wordsworth
could
have
cared
little
for
the
shy
blossom
although
he
does
say
as
there
are
violets
they
will
have
their
place
in
story
he
leaves
it
to
others
to
tell
the
story
referring
to
the
violet
only
three
or
four
times
in
all
his
voluminous
writings
his
counterpart
in
this
respect
among
american
poets
is
longfellow
in
whose
musical
numbers
singularly
enough
the
violet
has
almost
no
place
at
all
nor
was
the
flower
a
favorite
with
tennyson
though
each
of
his
rare
references
to
it
is
a
gem
as
this
meadow
your
walks
have
left
so
sweet
that
wherever
a
march
wind
sighs
he
sets
the
of
his
feet
in
violets
blue
as
your
american
writers
have
on
the
whole
given
the
violet
a
more
prominent
place
than
have
their
english
brethren
of
the
lyre
pages
for
instance
are
fragrant
with
its
perfume
and
he
has
in
special
immortalized
the
yellow
variety
in
more
than
one
finely
turned
stanza
if
most
of
the
great
bards
have
been
reluctant
to
give
lady
violet
her
due
not
so
the
numerous
rank
and
file
of
the
verse
of
alice
cary
lucy
larcom
grace
greenwood
elizabeth
akers
adelaide
proctor
and
dozens
of
others
is
a
garden
of
with
the
violet
leading
the
dance
some
of
the
prettiest
conceits
occur
in
the
writings
of
authors
so
obscure
that
their
names
are
unfamiliar
to
most
readers
for
instance
one
must
look
far
for
a
volume
of
poetry
bearing
the
name
of
ethel
kelley
yet
these
fine
lines
are
attributed
to
her
her
hair
the
sunbeams
nest
and
in
her
eyes
the
violets
blow
while
in
the
summer
of
her
breast
the
songbird
thoughts
flit
to
and
the
compiler
of
this
book
has
spent
many
pleasant
hours
in
culling
his
violets
from
the
immense
field
of
english
and
american
poetry
another
volume
of
equal
size
could
readily
be
made
up
from
extracts
containing
references
to
the
flower
to
say
nothing
of
german
french
spanish
italian
and
scandinavian
poetry
which
has
not
been
considered
