making

house
first
of
all
i
draw
the
smoke
trailing
up
the
sky
then
the
chimney
underneath
and
birds
all
flying
by
then
the
house
and
every
window
watching
like
an
eye
everybody
else
begins
with
the
house
but
i
love
the
smoke
the
best
of
all
and
you
do
know
why
here
it
goes
like
little
feathers
sailing
up
the
sky
the
busy
child
i
have
so
many
things
to
do
i
do
know
when
i
shall
be
through
i
had
to
watch
the
rain
come
sliding
down
the
and
i
was
humming
all
the
time
around
my
head
a
kind
of
rhyme
and
blowing
softly
on
the
glass
to
see
the
dimness
come
and
pass
i
made
a
picture
with
my
breath
rubbed
out
to
show
the
underneath
i
built
a
city
on
the
floor
and
then
i
went
and
was
a
and
i
escaped
from
square
to
square
that
greener
on
the
carpet
there
until
at
last
i
came
to
us
but
it
was
very
because
if
i
had
stepped
outside
i
made
believe
i
should
have
died
and
now
i
have
the
boat
to
mend
and
all
our
supper
to
pretend
i
am
so
busy
all
the
day
i
have
any
time
to
play
sunset
those
islands
far
away
are
mine
beyond
the
cloudy
strip
and
something
beautiful
besides
i
think
it
is
a
ship
wind
i
let
them
call
it
just
and
tell
me
not
to
grieve
but
i
know
all
it
left
behind
and
more
than
they
believe
i
know
about
the
lands
where
people
never
sleep
they
hide
their
faces
in
their
hands
and
rock
and
weep
and
weep
and
i
too
little
all
alone
to
go
and
find
them
yet
but
oh
i
hear
when
i
am
grown
i
never
will
forget
late
my
father
brought
somebody
up
to
show
us
all
asleep
they
came
as
softly
up
the
stairs
as
you
could
creep
they
whispered
in
the
doorway
there
and
looked
at
us
awhile
i
had
my
eyes
shut
up
but
i
could
feel
him
smile
i
shut
my
eyes
up
close
and
lay
as
still
as
i
could
keep
because
i
knew
he
wanted
us
to
be
asleep
cakes
and
ale
i
always
glad
when
andrew
comes
if
only
i
am
there
he
stays
awhile
and
talks
to
me
as
if
he
did
not
care
he
took
me
to
some
music
once
when
it
was
all
for
me
and
oh
i
had
a
splendid
time
and
he
said
so
did
he
it
lasts
as
if
the
music
still
went
round
and
round
the
he
said
he
had
a
good
time
too
and
i
said
so
did
i
the
journey
i
never
saw
the
hills
so
far
and
blue
the
way
the
pictures
are
and
flowers
flowers
growing
thick
but
not
a
one
for
me
to
pick
the
land
was
running
from
the
train
all
blurry
through
the
and
then
it
all
looked
flat
and
still
when
up
there
jumped
a
little
hill
i
saw
the
windows
and
the
spires
and
sparrows
sitting
on
the
wires
and
fences
running
up
and
down
and
then
we
cut
straight
through
a
town
i
saw
a
valley
like
a
cup
and
ponds
that
twinkled
and
dried
up
illustration
the
journey
i
counted
meadows
that
were
burnt
and
there
were
trees
and
then
there
were
we
crossed
the
bridges
with
a
roar
then
hummed
the
way
we
went
before
and
tunnels
made
it
dark
and
light
like
of
day
and
night
until
i
saw
the
chimneys
rise
and
lights
and
lights
and
lights
like
eyes
and
when
they
took
me
through
the
door
i
heard
it
all
begin
to
i
thought
as
far
as
i
could
see
that
everybody
wanted
me
pigeons
out
walking
they
never
seem
to
hurry
no
even
for
the
crowd
they
dip
and
coo
and
move
as
slow
all
so
soft
and
proud
you
can
see
the
wavy
specks
of
on
their
necks
little
little
cloud
cloud
that
goes
the
very
way
all
the
bubbles
do
blue
and
green
and
green
and
gray
gold
and
rosy
too
and
they
talk
as
bubbles
could
if
they
only
ever
would
talk
and
call
and
coo
till
you
try
to
catch
one
so
just
to
make
it
stay
while
the
colors
turn
but
oh
then
they
fly
away
all
at
once
two
three
four
five
like
a
snowstorm
all
alive
gray
and
white
and
gray
concerning
love
i
wish
she
would
not
ask
me
if
i
love
the
kitten
more
than
her
of
course
i
love
her
but
i
love
the
kitten
too
and
it
has
fur
curls
it
happens
that
way
in
the
world
with
everything
you
see
some
people
have
their
hair
all
curl
some
straight
as
straight
can
be
it
is
a
mystery
yes
some
have
hair
that
waves
and
clings
and
does
all
kinds
of
curly
things
and
some
not
ever
till
they
die
and
nobody
knows
why
and
some
already
born
with
curls
some
of
them
are
not
even
girls
i
always
think
of
curly
hair
it
looks
as
if
the
curls
came
there
the
way
i
hum
around
a
song
more
things
than
really
do
belong
the
happier
i
feel
the
more
i
sing
i
never
heard
before
i
curl
more
music
round
the
air
the
way
it
looks
with
curly
hair
but
you
may
sing
all
day
you
know
you
can
not
really
make
it
grow
and
you
may
know
it
is
not
fair
but
that
wo
give
you
curly
hair
i
was
lost
the
day
that
i
was
lost
i
never
shall
forget
i
wake
up
in
the
night
sometimes
and
think
it
happening
she
let
me
go
a
minute
she
said
she
would
take
care
but
she
let
me
go
a
minute
and
then
she
was
there
everything
grew
awful
that
was
good
before
and
the
faces
did
look
like
people
any
more
it
made
you
feel
like
wrinkles
all
over
you
and
cold
it
made
you
feel
two
hundred
and
years
old
it
was
like
being
homesick
and
hurt
when
no
one
cares
it
was
exactly
like
a
wreck
and
people
smiled
like
bears
i
thought
that
my
own
mother
had
just
forgotten
me
i
thought
that
god
had
lost
me
like
a
penny
in
the
sea
the
noise
all
seemed
to
grow
and
grow
and
roar
until
it
drowned
and
i
could
only
say
and
then
at
last
they
found
me
they
found
me
polite
visitor
i
feel
polite
outside
the
door
but
when
it
should
begin
i
ca
remember
not
to
ask
if
just
their
cat
is
in
and
if
the
sun
should
sprinkle
through
along
the
floor
that
way
i
ca
remember
what
i
do
if
i
am
urged
to
stay
and
when
i
shaken
hands
all
round
no
matter
how
i
try
i
ca
remember
not
to
go
and
kiss
their
dog
thank
you
they
very
well
i
think
i
better
thank
you
please
i
always
late
my
mother
told
me
so
yes
thank
you
if
i
have
to
bring
a
message
yes
i
come
and
if
your
bird
will
only
sing
and
when
your
cat
is
the
mystic
people
say
to
me
penny
for
your
thought
and
i
ca
remember
thinking
and
i
should
think
i
ought
i
was
sleeping
either
i
know
that
because
i
saw
things
out
of
both
my
eyes
i
wonder
where
i
was
now
i
back
i
see
them
sitting
all
around
and
the
noise
together
makes
a
purring
sound
but
i
know
something
more
than
just
awhile
ago
i
know
something
more
i
wonder
what
i
know
illustration
the
mystic
market
i
went
to
market
yesterday
and
it
is
like
a
fair
of
everything
you
like
to
see
but
nothing
live
is
there
the
pigeons
hanging
up
to
eat
and
rabbits
by
their
little
feet
and
no
one
seemed
to
care
and
there
were
fishes
out
in
rows
bright
ones
of
every
kind
some
were
pink
and
silver
too
but
all
of
them
were
blind
yes
everything
you
like
to
it
would
not
make
you
happy
much
but
no
one
seemed
to
mind
and
loveliest
of
all
a
deer
only
its
eyes
were
blurred
and
hanging
by
it
very
near
a
beautiful
great
bird
so
i
could
smooth
his
feathers
through
and
kiss
them
very
softly
too
but
oh
he
never
stirred
little
why
are
some
streets
so
different
the
kittens
all
are
long
and
thin
i
think
they
have
more
flowers
there
but
broken
things
to
grow
them
in
why
do
they
like
the
house
so
high
with
such
a
little
of
the
ground
and
do
you
think
they
ever
see
the
moon
before
it
old
and
round
why
wo
i
like
to
play
there
too
with
all
the
funny
things
to
eat
and
all
the
carts
with
little
bells
and
in
the
street
and
if
i
ca
then
why
do
they
stay
out
the
whole
of
evening
why
do
they
always
seem
to
have
just
of
everything
why
do
you
come
why
ca
i
go
it
is
fair
what
makes
it
so
if
they
do
like
it
do
you
know
why
do
you
always
never
know
chestnut
stands
i
wonder
why
you
feel
somehow
it
wrong
to
leave
a
chestnut
stand
with
all
so
much
of
what
you
want
in
both
your
pockets
and
your
hand
i
always
have
to
turn
around
it
sounds
so
hurt
i
do
see
why
that
little
crying
sound
i
do
remember
by
and
by
there
is
not
anything
so
good
as
chestnuts
when
they
hot
can
be
it
must
be
fun
to
count
them
out
with
one
for
you
and
one
for
me
and
yet
it
stays
so
doleful
there
for
all
the
people
going
by
and
breathing
frosty
on
the
air
like
something
trying
not
to
cry
it
is
something
i
was
told
i
know
it
small
and
scared
and
it
like
when
both
your
hands
are
cold
and
pockets
you
ca
put
them
in
like
something
happened
long
ago
like
feeling
homesick
yes
and
shy
like
being
sorry
when
you
know
you
wo
remember
by
and
by
the
play
the
thing
i
never
dared
to
look
away
while
they
were
tuning
so
for
fear
the
curtain
might
go
up
and
i
not
see
it
go
then
all
at
once
it
all
went
dark
to
make
you
hold
your
breath
and
hark
oh
hold
your
breath
and
hark
excepting
where
the
curtain
was
it
stayed
as
black
as
night
and
that
kept
still
one
minute
more
all
edged
across
with
light
then
up
and
up
and
oh
so
soon
it
was
like
all
inside
the
moon
yes
sitting
in
the
moon
and
oh
how
beautiful
they
were
and
could
we
see
them
near
and
oh
how
brave
at
everything
but
it
was
somehow
queer
to
see
that
smiling
way
they
had
they
smiled
so
much
but
not
all
glad
no
not
so
always
glad
i
wish
we
could
go
away
i
wish
it
would
begin
all
over
now
and
never
end
i
wish
we
were
locked
in
oh
ca
we
see
it
all
again
sunday
monday
when
ah
when
when
windows
once
and
in
the
daytime
too
i
made
myself
afraid
playing
with
the
till
the
houses
seemed
to
watch
people
going
by
and
they
kept
me
looking
too
wondering
where
and
why
i
were
that
other
boy
if
i
were
those
men
going
by
with
things
to
sell
who
would
i
be
then
windows
with
their
eyebrows
high
windows
like
a
frown
thinking
it
all
over
so
with
the
curtains
down
tall
ones
that
are
somehow
sad
narrow
ones
that
blink
all
the
windows
you
can
see
make
you
think
and
think
i
were
that
old
man
and
i
looked
up
at
me
watching
from
the
window
here
oh
then
how
would
it
be
sometimes
they
are
golden
with
shining
in
their
every
time
the
sun
sets
it
happens
like
surprise
and
so
bright
i
almost
forget
the
dream
i
made
but
i
keep
it
for
the
days
i
want
to
make
myself
afraid
i
were
that
boy
who
limps
now
it
dark
and
snowing
and
if
i
were
going
home
oh
where
would
i
be
going
the
masterpiece
my
mother
cut
it
out
for
me
and
started
it
so
i
could
see
and
then
she
turned
some
edges
in
and
let
me
take
it
to
begin
i
made
it
but
i
did
not
know
how
very
long
it
takes
to
sew
i
took
a
long
time
for
that
stitch
and
now
it
there
i
do
know
which
is
better
but
not
one
is
small
and
they
are
not
alike
at
all
that
side
was
very
hard
to
fix
and
then
the
needle
always
pricks
but
you
must
hold
it
and
take
care
because
the
point
is
always
there
and
knots
keep
coming
by
and
by
and
then
no
matter
how
you
try
the
thread
comes
out
of
its
old
eye
but
some
way
now
i
have
it
done
i
think
it
is
a
pretty
one
illustration
the
masterpiece
ode
on
the
dog
i
my
angel
with
a
rosy
tongue
my
own
my
own
why
ca
the
things
we
live
among
let
us
alone
why
do
they
have
to
talk
the
livelong
day
about
such
silly
things
but
if
they
must
why
ca
they
anyway
have
either
tails
or
wings
ii
of
course
i
can
not
love
them
as
they
are
as
much
as
you
why
are
they
ever
really
beautiful
they
too
with
curly
coats
like
wool
and
floppy
ears
to
pull
yes
and
a
wide
pink
mouth
with
such
a
smile
yes
and
a
tail
that
beats
time
all
the
while
beautiful
beautiful
and
golden
stars
for
eyes
behind
the
darkest
trees
till
your
hair
parted
why
ca
they
have
such
darling
ways
as
these
why
ca
they
be
so
lovely
when
they
sneeze
why
ca
they
ever
be
so
or
even
look
so
wise
as
you
my
wonderful
even
if
you
wo
say
my
true
prince
in
disguise
why
ca
they
be
as
funny
when
they
try
to
sing
a
song
and
when
for
everything
that
i
can
do
they
wo
agree
why
ca
they
think
they
always
in
the
wrong
like
you
iii
why
you
o
precious
thing
you
are
swift
almost
as
any
over
the
tall
grass
how
you
arch
and
spring
yes
like
a
bow
and
arrow
oh
and
how
good
to
see
you
when
it
snows
plough
a
long
lovely
pathway
with
your
nose
no
one
could
do
it
i
suppose
iv
my
dearest
blessing
and
my
very
own
even
when
i
am
grown
never
do
you
forsake
me
if
you
do
go
to
heaven
when
you
die
neither
will
i
nothing
can
ever
make
me
i
wo
go
for
all
that
they
can
do
no
on
the
steps
outside
and
down
below
forever
and
ever
and
ever
i
stay
too
with
you
the
sorrows
if
this
is
all
it
will
be
like
i
wish
to
die
i
do
care
how
while
i
am
very
very
young
as
young
as
almost
now
they
never
felt
what
sorrow
was
or
never
learned
their
golden
rule
they
say
are
your
happiest
with

a
secret
to
myself
that
no

can
see
i
hum
it
over
to
myself
and
no
one
hears
but
me
something
you
do
know
i
knew
long
and
the
more
i
never
tell
you
it
the
more
it
gets
to
be
it
makes
me
feel
as
purry
as
the
kitten
on
your
knee
it
makes
me
feel
as
round
and
warm
as
the
sparrow
on
that
tree
it
makes
me
puff
my
feathers
out
the
way
he
puffs
out
and
if
you
think
i
have
one
i
tell
you
what
it
is
maybe
the
christmas
tree
i
know
you
in
the
house
i
know
you
are
in
there
i
feel
the
green
and
breathing
all
around
the
air
i
know
you
safe
and
warm
i
know
you
very
near
darling
tree
do
you
hear
i
promised
not
to
look
the
way
i
did
before
but
i
can
hear
you
purring
purring
through
the
door
a
green
soft
purring
just
as
if
you
knew
here
loves
do
feel
lonely
now
you
are
wait
for
all
the
shining
things
all

then
you
wo

what
to
think
all
over
darling
tree
and
i
love
you
i
love
you
and
everybody
too
and
so
does
the
that
brought
us
you
and
if
you
have
anything
for
me
this
year
love
you
do
you
hear
when
i
wished
on
my
first
star
while
the
rest
begin
and
the
grass
is
waking
up
oh
she
calls
us
in
then
she
calls
us
in
but
i
would
go
unless
i
were
sure
there
be
something
more
like
that
indoors
something
more
to
see
beautiful
to
see
so
she
lights
the
candle
then
where
the
shadows
are
and
it
stands
and
holds
its
breath
then
it
makes
a
star
then
it
makes
a
star
i
curl
up
for
my
dark
where
i
can
see
and
i
watch
the
till
it
looks
at
me
oh
it
looks
at
me
illustration
i
followed
till
the
sun
was
down
as
low
as
to
the
very
brink
and
still
the
pathway
kept
along
around
the
world
i
think
i
tried
to
find
it
everywhere
a
bell
would
clink
and
clink
and
call
but
someway
i
can
never
find
that
farthest
one
of
all
i
been
in
all
the
tallest
weeds
and
thistles
with
the
loudest
bees
and
once
across
the
and
through
the
and
now
you
hear
it
hushing
up
and
then
you
hear
it
clink
and
clink
and
if
you
found
it
it
would
lead
around
the
world
i
think
it
sounds
so
small
and
gold
and
far
beyond
the
and
so
as
if
there
must
be
there
oh
something
wonderful
excepting
when
they
very
loud
and
then
when
they
almost
too
bright
i
love
to
see
a
excepting
when
it
in
the
night
it
harder
to
remember
then
very
wicked
not
to
trust
a
because
it
sure
to
know
and
then
besides
you
it
will
light
your
heart
yes
the
deepest
darkness
ever
made
could
never
hide
the
guilty
one
who
feels
at
all
the
thunder
is
the
best
of
all
except
the
wading
for
the
birds
and
then
the
shining
in
the
wet
oh
and
the
rainbow
afterwards
it
feels
forever
without
end
the
time
i
have
to
stay
it
even
harder
to
keep
still
than
pray
and
pray
and
pray
the
reading
happens
all
the
time
the
praying
rolls
along
and
something
makes
them
always
sing
a
long
long
song
so
when
i
nearly
gone
to
sleep
i
make
my
penny
i
walk
it
up
and
down
to
hear
the
talk
and
talk
and
talk
and
if
i
lose
it
on
the
floor
before
they
pass
the
plate
why
then
there
nothing
more
to
do
but
wait
wait
till
when
you
have
to
go
to
sleep
or
else
you
have
to
die
they
let
you
out
and
straight
into
the
sky
nests
all
hiding
up
the
trees
and
roads
to
make
you
run
and
everything
like
squirrels
in
the
sun
the
sun
angels
they
are
more
shy
than
snow
you
may
look
up
and
try
to
see
one
there
just
when
you
feel
it
breathing
on
your
hair
but
then
it
has
to
somehow
i
know
they
want
you
to
believe
how
bright
they
are
and
never
try
to
see
whether
they
keep
their
word
for
that
would
be
as
if
they
could
deceive
that
makes
them
grieve
so
if
you
want
yours
near
and
hide
your
eyes
and
keep
quite
still
and
say
i
have
wanted
you
all
day
all
day
shine
at
me
angel
dear
it
will
be
here
the
he
only
looked
like
a
as
ragged
just
as
any
but
he
might
have
been
an
angel
too
so
i
gave
him
my
penny
i
waited
till
i
thought
i
saw
him
shining
through
and
when
he
held
out
his
hand
i
watched
for
what
would
happen
to
my
penny
he
might
have
been
an
angel
too
but
i
know
he
was
any
for
he
frowned
at
me
like
that
you
see
when
it
was
but
one
penny
and
now
that
gone
and
i
do
care
i
rather
not
have
any
than
keep
it
if
an
angel
came
and
asked
me
for
my
penny
the
green
i
do
know
how
to
read
the
words
nor
how
the
black
things
go
but
if
you
stand
it
up
and
sing
you
never
have
to
know
the
music
sounds
alike
each
time
when
people
play
but
every
time
i
sing
myself
it
sounds
a
different
way
and
when
i
sung
the
book
all
through
and
every
page
around
i
stand
it
upside
down
and
sing
to
see
how
that
will
sound
i
sing
how
all
the
things
outside
the
window
look
to
me
the
shiny
wrinkles
in
the
road
and
then
about
my
tree
illustration
the
green
i
sing
about
the
city
too
the
noises
and
the
wheels
and
windows
blinking
in
the
sun
i
sing
the
way
it
feels
and
if
a
sparrow
flies
across
i
put
him
in
the
i
sing
whatever
happens
in
to
make
it
last
for
long
i
sing
about
the
things
i
think
of
almost
everything
sometimes
i
do
know
what
to
think
till
i
begin
to
sing
it
happens
when
the
birds
go
by
and
leave
you
far
behind
and
you
flutter
till
you
ache
all
around
your
like
a
flag
like
a
flag
flapping
at
the
wind
it
happens
when
you
catch
the
hills
as
blue
as
yesterday
you
hold
your
heart
in
both
your
hands
or
it
would
fly
away
yes
it
would
yes
it
would
away
away
away
it
makes
your
heart
into
a
bird
that
darts
and
leaps
and
sings
oh
feel
my
pinafore
high
up
oh
do
you
think
it
wings
do
you
think
do
you
think
oh
could
it
be
wings
early
i
like
to
lie
and
wait
to
see
my
mother
braid
her
hair
it
is
as
long
as
it
can
be
and
yet
she
does
care
i
love
my
mother
hair
and
then
the
way
her
fingers
go
they
look
so
quick
and
white
in
and
out
and
to
and
fro
and
braiding
in
the
light
and
it
is
always
right
so
then
she
winds
it
shiny
brown
around
her
head
into
a
crown
just
like
the
day
before
and
then
she
looks
and
pats
it
down
and
looks
a
minute
while
i
stay
here
all
still
and
cool
oh
is
morning
beautiful
the
wind
east
the
wind
east
oh
oh
only
a
little
while
ago
was
just
like
yesterday
but
now
now
only
now
the
world
all
turned
some
silver
way
i
know
how
i
know
how
the
wind
east
the
wind
east
salt
salt
wind
that
i
love
so
all
the
things
in
the
garden
blow
wavy
gray
and
the
trees
all
know
trees
that
never
never
can
go
must
know
how
it
would
feel
to
be
there
where
the
ships
sail
to
and
fro
ships
on
the
blue
blue
sea
and
the
homesick
ones
by
the
bridge
up
here
are
tugging
to
get
their
anchors
clear
and
they
reach
up
high
to
see
they
catch
their
breath
when
they
feel
the
air
and
the
rigging
stirs
and
the
lanterns
stare
for
they
know
the
tide
is
high
out
there
the
gulls
go
skirling
by
out
there
the
gulls
and
the
wind
go
free
and
they
tug
and
they
pull
and
they
wonder
so
when
will
the
captain
let
them
go
oh
oh
to
sea
to
sea
and
shall
we
light
the
candle
now
and
leave
since
there
is
so
much
more
our
cupful
and
the
share
of
bread
here
by
the
open
door
for
some
one
might
be
wanting
it
if
there
should
chance
to
come
this
way
a
very
poor
man
or
a
bird
or
maybe
god
some
day
