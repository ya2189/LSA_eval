a

of
erin
far
to
westward
in
the
sunset
tall
and
bare
her
cliffs
arise
mother
erin
with
the
tender
love
and
laughter
in
her
eyes
looking
out
across
the
waters
dreaming
of
her
argosies
argosies
that
sail
forever
laden
down
with
hopes
and
fears
ships
of
dream
returning
never
though
she
waits
throughout
the
years
waits
with
eyes
wherein
the
laughter
grows
more
sorrowful
than
tears
one
by
one
her
children
leave
her
stalwart
sons
and
daughters
fair
straining
eyes
grown
dim
with
anguish
as
her
hilltops
melt
in
air
bending
from
her
cliffs
she
watches
drinking
deep
of
their
despair
yet
she
showers
her
gifts
upon
them
gifts
of
laughter
and
of
tears
gives
their
eyes
the
vision
splendid
fairy
music
to
their
ears
weaves
around
their
feet
her
magic
spells
that
strengthen
through
the
years
so
her
children
unforgetting
their
footsteps
roam
turn
their
hearts
forever
westward
longing
for
the
day
to
come
when
once
more
they
see
her
stooping
from
her
heights
to
call
them
home
the
road
across
slieve
rue
as
i
went
down
to
dublin
town
the
road
across
slieve
rue
i
met
a
maid
in
crimson
gown
her
little
feet
were
bare
and
brown
she
looked
at
me
she
laughed
at
me
with
eyes
of
watchet
blue
no
mortal
maid
was
half
so
fair
or
half
so
dainty
sweet
the
sun
was
tangled
in
her
hair
and
o
her
feet
were
brown
and
bare
i
laid
the
very
heart
of
me
before
those
dancing
feet
o
go
you
down
to
dublin
quay
to
sail
upon
the
bay
i
pray
you
gentle
sir
said
she
to
turn
and
walk
a
mile
with
me
so
witching
were
the
eyes
of
her
i
could
not
say
her
nay
she
gave
to
me
a
ring
of
gold
and
kisses
two
and
three
she
sang
me
elfin
songs
of
old
she
lured
my
heart
into
her
hold
then
turned
and
left
me
lonely
there
a
wicked
witch
was
she
as
i
went
down
to
dublin
quay
by
darkling
ways
alone
my
fairy
maid
was
gone
from
me
for
o
a
wicked
witch
was
she
and
all
my
heart
within
me
lay
as
heavy
as
a
stone
to
yeats
a
wind
of
dreams
comes
singing
over
sea
from
where
the
white
waves
kiss
the
shores
of
home
bringing
upon
its
rainbow
wings
to
me
glimpses
of
days
gone
by
of
wastes
of
water
where
the
cry
above
the
sounding
foam
or
through
the
mists
do
finn
and
usheen
ride
with
all
their
men
along
some
faery
shore
while
bran
and
sgeolan
follow
at
their
side
adown
the
shadowy
track
till
in
the
sunset
caoilte
hair
blows
back
and
niamh
calls
once
more
or
the
brown
bees
hum
through
the
livelong
day
in
glades
of
inisfree
where
sunlight
gleams
the
bean
flower
scents
again
the
dear
old
way
once
more
the
burns
the
memory
of
the
long
dead
past
returns
borne
on
that
wind
of
dreams
a
fairy
tale
with
sword
at
side
on
his
charger
good
the
king
son
of
erin
into
the
depths
of
the
dark
green
wood
forward
was
faring
and
faith
the
sweetest
song
in
the
world
his
heart
was
hearing
onward
he
rode
with
heart
elate
gaily
he
sought
her
she
the
princess
to
be
his
mate
the
great
king
daughter
jewelled
fingers
and
golden
crown
slim
young
body
and
eyes
as
brown
as
the
brown
on
he
rode
through
a
laughing
land
the
ways
grew
wider
there
stood
a
cottage
close
at
hand
and
there
he
spied
her
o
but
her
feet
were
brown
and
bare
and
brown
were
her
curls
as
she
stood
there
with
her
geese
beside
her
alas
for
the
princess
proud
and
slim
the
great
king
daughter
we
trust
she
wasted
no
thought
on
him
for
he
straight
forgot
her
forgot
her
jewels
and
golden
crown
for
the
laughing
eyes
were
brown
as
the
brown
then
straightway
down
from
his
steed
he
sprang
and
bent
above
her
o
sweet
were
the
songs
the
breezes
sang
across
the
clover
but
what
the
words
he
said
in
her
ear
since
none
but
her
geese
were
by
to
hear
i
ca
discover
and
what
of
the
princess
proud
and
high
good
luck
upon
her
sure
another
prince
came
riding
by
and
he
wooed
and
won
her
now
i
tell
the
tale
as
was
told
to
me
by
a
fairy
lad
across
the
sea
in
county
connor
the
king
of
erin
daughter
the
king
of
erin
daughter
had
hair
and
bright
the
king
of
erin
daughter
her
eyes
were
like
the
sea
o
rose
of
all
the
roses

you
forgotten
quite
the
story
of
the
days
of
old
that
once
you
told
to
me
the
king
of
erin
daughter
went
up
the
mountain
side
and
who
but
she
was
singing
as
she
went
upon
her
way
o
somewhere
waits
a
king
son
and
i
shall
be
his
bride
and
tall
he
is
and
fair
he
is
and
none
shall
say
him
nay
the
king
of
erin
daughter
o
fair
was
she
and
sweet
went
laughing
up
the
mountain
without
a
look
behind
till
on
the
lofty
summit
that
lay
beneath
her
feet
she
found
a
king
son
waiting
there
his
brows
with
poppies
twined
o
tall
was
he
and
fair
was
he
he
looked
upon
her
face
and
whispered
in
her
ear
a
word
unnamed
of
mortal
breath
and
very
still
she
rested
clasped
close
in
his
embrace
the

spring
in
the
city
outside
my
garret
window
set
amid
the
city
dust
and
blare
one
bit
of
green
is
growing
yet
a
gnarled
old
hawthorn
tree
stands
there
a
little
bird
sings
in
its
bough
where
break
as
white
as
foam
it
breaks
my
heart
to
hear
him
now
for
o
he
sings
the
songs
of
home
his
wings
are
of
the
hodden
grey
a
little
lilting
thing
is
he
he
pipes
a
carol
blythe
and
gay
but
sad
the
thoughts
he
brings
to
me
once
more
the
irish
hills
rise
green
the
lark
springs
to
the
sun
once
more
once
more
i
tread
the
old
boreen
and
see
you
at
the
cabin
door
the
young
may
moon
her
cresset
burns
in
misty
skies
of
irish
blue
and
for
an
hour
my
spirit
turns
from
dreary
streets
to
dream
of
you
o
little
lilting
birdeen
cease
you
stab
my
heart
with
every
strain
bringing
me
back
old
memories
of
days
that
will
not
come
again
the
wild
geese
o
pleasant
are
the
fields
of
france
her
hills
aglow
and
broad
and
smooth
her
rivers
are
as
singing
on
they
go
durance
and
seine
and
loire
and
rhone
but
not
for
us
they
flow
and
sweetly
on
a
frenchman
ear
the
songs
of
france
may
ring
but
not
for
us
their
melody
who
still
amid
their
swing
the
sobbing
beat
alone
can
hear
of
songs
we
used
to
sing
for
as
the
streams
of
babylon
though
broad
and
fair
they
swept
were
waters
of
captivity
whereby
the
hebrews
wept
dreaming
of
dear
jerusalem
where
their
forefathers
slept
so
dreaming
by
the
waves
of
france
we
think
on
sion
too
heartsick
with
longing
for
the
streams
we
and
our
fathers
knew
liffey
and
lee
and
avonmore
and
tawny
avondhu
and
turning
homeward
yearning
eyes
that
shall
see
her
strand
we
tune
our
harps
and
strike
once
more
the
chords
with
faltering
hand
and
sing
again
the
song
of
home
far
in
a
lonely
land
if
we
forget
jerusalem
ah
well
we
know
the
song
our
waters
of
captivity
bitter
their
waves
and
strong
and
faint
our
hearts
for
weariness
how
long
o
lord
how
long
a
song
of
memory
here
as
i
sit
in
the
dark
and
ponder
watching
the
firelight
dance
and
gleam
what
brings
them
back
to
my
mind
i
wonder
those
old
days
of
laughter
and
dream
dear
old
days
when
we
roamed
together
all
the
pathways
that
cross
slieve
rue
caring
for
naught
in
the
sunny
weather
laughing
together
i
and
you
voice
of
the
west
wind
calling
calling
sobbing
beat
of
the
irish
rain
whispering
leaves
and
waters
falling
ay
and
you
by
my
side
again
out
of
the
past
i
hear
them
ringing
all
the
songs
of
the
days
of
old
hear
the
lark
on
the
hillside
singing
see
the
gleam
of
the
gorse
gold
till
as
i
sit
in
the
firelight
dreaming
watching
the
shadows
grow
apace
out
of
the
long
dead
years
comes
gleaming
there
in
the
flames
your
laughing
face
all
the
days
that
are
past
and
over
gone
in
the
turf
smoke
curling
blue
and
from
their
wreckage
i
recover
song
and
sunshine
and
youth
and
you
in
memory
of
a
failure
o
kathaleen
ni
houlihan
in
blood
and
ashes
lie
the
dreams
we
dreamed
the
faith
we
held
the
hopes
we
builded
high
once
more
the
path
that
emmet
trod
our
bleeding
feet
must
press
once
more
our
hearts
must
bear
the
load
of
failure
and
distress
but
though
the
dream
in
ruin
fell
yet
this
much
still
is
true
o
kathaleen
ni
houlihan
at
least
we
died
for
you
o
kathaleen
ni
houlihan
the
hills
with
spring
are
fair
and
fragrant
blows
the
daffodil
and
violets
scent
the
air
once
more
from
out
the
morning
sky
the
lark
gay
challenge
rings
mounting
the
blue
to
heaven
gate
but
not
for
us
he
sings
and
summer
comes
and
autumn
tints
with
bronze
and
gold
the
fern
and
bees
hum
in
the
heather
bloom
but
we
shall
not
return
o
kathaleen
ni
houlihan
give
us
nor
praise
nor
blame
only
a
little
irish
dust
to
cover
up
our
shame
only
a
sod
of
irish
ground
our
broken
dream
to
hide
where
some
may
pause
and
say
a
prayer
and
was
for
her
they
died
for
though
we
brought
you
grief
and
pain
yet
this
much
still
is
true
o
kathaleen
ni
houlihan
at
least
we
died
for
you
the
unchristened
child
alanna
alanna
within
the
churchyard
round
there
many
graves
of
childer
there
they
lie
in
holy
ground
but
yours
is
on
the
mountain
side
beneath
the
hawthorn
tree
o
fleet
one
my
sweet
one
that
gone
so
far
from
me
alanna
alanna
when
that
small
mound
was
made
no
mass
was
sung
no
bell
was
rung
no
priest
above
it
prayed
unchristened
childer
souls
they
say
may
see
heaven
light
o
lone
one
my
own
one
where
strays
your
soul
alanna
alanna
this
life
a
weary
one
and
there
little
time
for
thinking
when
the
hours
of
work
are
done
and
the
others
have
forgotten
but
there
times
i
sit
apart
o
fair
one
my
dear
one
and
hold
you
in
my
heart
alanna
alanna
if
i
were
mary
mild
and
heard
outside
the
gates
of
heaven
a
little
crying
child
what
though
its
brow
the
chrisom
lacked
i
lift
the
golden
pin
o
bright
one
my
white
one
and
bid
you

you
to
me
for
through

i
hear
your
voices
calling
out
of
the
magic
spaces
of
infinite
delight
i
see
your
curls
i
see
your
dear
eyes
shine
i
feel
the
childish
fingers
slipped
softly
into
mine
you
bring
me
back
the
the
old
delightful
when
all
the
world
was
laughter
and
life
seemed
half
divine
thus
from
the
shades
that
gather
around
my
path
your
glad
have
drawn
me
back
to
your
lands
of
light
giving
me
for
my
sadness
the
medicine
of
your
gladness
o
littlest
hands
and
dearest
o
golden
heads
and
bright
a
love
song
love
came
to
me
once
more
his
wings
all
drenched
with
rain
silent
his
singing
lips
his
eyes
were
dark
with
pain
dead
roses
in
his
hands
gone
were
the
flowers
of
yore
only
a
poor
grey
ghost
love
lingered
at
my
door
wasted
his
rounded
limbs
and
grey
his
golden
hair
poor
shadowy
silent
god
who
once
had
been
so
fair
o
love
great
love
i
cried
why
come
you
thus
to
me
i
am
love
ghost
he
said
men
name
me
memory
a
song
of
love
love
came
loitering
down
the
way
heart
but
we
two
were
young
laughter
light
in
his
eyes
there
lay
music
was
on
his
tongue
stay
love
stay
walk
with
us
pray
sweet
were
the
songs
he
sung
love
with
us
goes
wandering
still
heart
but
his
songs
are
sweet
suns
may
shine
or
the
rains
beat
chill
what
matter
cold
or
heat
blue
or
grey
love
goes
our
way
summer
follows
his
feet
love
he
has
been
a
comrade
true
heart
how
the
seasons
fly
joy
and
sorrow
have
found
us
too
greeted
and
passed
us
by
so
love
stay
they
may
go
their
way
and
love
can
never
die
dead
love
fold
the
hands
grown
still
and
cold
lay
ye
by
the
broken
bow
that
shall
feel
his
hold
nevermore
while
the
seasons
fly
draw
the
shroud
above
his
eyes
love
that
laughs
an
hour
and
dies
seek
no
more
to
entrance
win
at
his
gate
silent
now
are
the
song
and
din
jest
and
dance
that
were
there
of
late
never
more
shall
he
arise
love
that
laughs
an
hour
and
dies
listen
not
for
ye
shall
catch
nevermore
the
sound
of
his
finger
on
the
latch
nor
see
him
stand
in
the
open
door
shall
see
in
any
guise
love
that
laughs
an
hour
and
dies
the
wife
from
the
sea
i
snatched
her
from
her
home
away
from
her
great
waters
cool
and
free
my
in
whose
eyes
there
lay
the
depths
and
dangers
of
the
sea
i
brought
her
where
faint
breezes
sweep
through
lanes
walled
in
with
hedges
high
and
sown
with
luscious
grass
and
deep
at
ease
the
fatted
pastures
lie
i
gave
her
my
poor
cottage
home
the
tame
face
of
the
countryside
who
knew
the
waves
withdrawing
foam
the
thunder
of
the
bursting
tide
and
day
by
day
did
i
rejoice
to
see
her
sit
beside
my
door
nor
knew
that
in
her
heart
the
voice
of
ocean
called
forever
more
until
the
grace
i
would
not
give
death
gave
his
mighty
hand
set
free
my
wild
that
could
not
live
without
her
waters
liberty
and
i
to
me
the
fields
are
dear
the
steadfast
earth
is
home
to
me
yet
night
by
night
in
dreams
i
hear
her
spirit
call
me
from
the
sea
a
storm
at
night
all
night
the
waves
broke
in
upon
the
shore
beneath
my
window
and
i
heard
the
rain
with
querulous
weak
fingers
evermore
beating
against
the
pane
and
through
the
darkness
saw
was
it
the
sweep
of
some
white
wing
above
the
foam
that
fain
would
cross
those
waters
wild
and
deep
and
find
its
mate
and
home
or
was
it
oh
dear
feet
why
should
you
leave
the
halls
of
heaven
with
all
their
warmth
and
light
to
come
where
winds
wail
and
where
waters
grieve
seeking
my
door
last
night
surely
you
came
not
was
some
bird
white
breast
flashed
through
the
night
and
not
your
waving
hand
some
weary
of
the
waves
unrest
that
sought
the
steadfast
land
and
yet
amid
the
sobbing
of
the
rain
outside
my
window
in
the
dark
and
chill
i
heard
your
voice
that
ever
and
again
called
and
would
not
be
still
until
the
morning
came
sullen
and
red
with
waves
that
beat
still
foaming
on
the
shore
the
wind
and
rain
had
ceased
and
lo
my
dead
had
gone
from
me
once
more
kitty
feet
sure
i
sitting
here
this
evening
while
the
firelight
flickers
low
and
i
looking
through
the
shadows
into
eyes
i
used
to
know
through
the
years
that
lie
between
us
into
tender
eyes
and
sweet
and
i
listening
in
the
darkness
for
the
sound
of
kitty
feet
kitty
feet
whose
tripping
faltered
into
silence
long
ago
ah
is
well
i
mind
those
evenings
gathering
shades
about
my
chair
and
the
sound
of
kitty
footsteps
dancing
gaily
down
the
stair
through
the
hall
and
past
the
doorway
till
i
turn
her
eyes
to
meet
well
my
heart
it
knew
the
measure
that
was
danced
by
kitty
feet
kitty
feet
that
dance
no
longer
lying
in
the
silence
there
yet
as
i
sit
dreaming
while
the
shadows
longer
grow
i
can
almost
think
i
hear
them
the
dear
steps
i
long
for
so
through
the
years
that
lie
between
us
comes
again
the
vision
sweet
and
my
heart
once
more
is
beating
to
the
tune
of
kitty
feet
kitty
feet
that
tripped
so
lightly
past
death
portals
long
ago
the
port
o
missing
ships
she
lies
across
the
western
main
beyond
the
sunset
rim
her
quays
are
packed
with
reeling
mists
a
city
strange
and
dim
and
silent
her
harbour
bar
the
ghostly
waters
brim
no
sound
of
life
is
in
her
streets
no
creak
of
rope
or
spar
comes
ever
from
the
water
edge
where
the
great
vessels
are
yet
ship
by
ship
steals
through
the
mists
across
her
harbour
bar
there
many
a
good
galleon
has
made
her
anchor
fast
and
many
a
tall
caravel
her
journeyings
ends
at
last
but
no
living
eye
may
look
upon
that
harbour
dim
and
vast
for
one
went
down
in
tropic
seas
and
one
put
fearless
forth
to
find
her
death
in
loneliness
icebergs
of
the
north
thus
ship
by
ship
and
crew
by
crew
the
ocean
tried
their
worth
she
lies
across
the
western
main
beyond
the
sunset
rim
her
quays
are
packed
with
reeling
mists
a
city
strange
and
dim
and
silent
her
harbour
bar
the
ghostly
waters
brim
the
ride
of
the
shadows
behind
the
pines
when
sunset
gleams
the
white
gates
of
the
land
of
dreams
stand
open
wide
and
all
adown
the
golden
road
that
leads
from
that
most
blest
abode
the
shadows
ride
who
in
the
light
of
common
day
may
now
no
more
abide
they
leave
their
meads
of
asphodel
the
starry
spaces
where
they
dwell
where
quiet
lies
they
leave
their
windless
glassy
sea
the
angel
songs
and
melody
of
paradise
to
walk
again
the
way
once
dear
to
mortal
eyes
with
beating
heart
i
watch
them
ride
across
the
gathering
shades
that
hide
that
country
bright
the
faces
that
i
loved
of
yore
eyes
that
shall
smile
on
me
no
more
with
mortal
light
shadows
of
all
good
things
and
fair
come
from
the
past
so
when
the
dying
sunset
gleams
behind
the
hills
the
gate
of
dreams
stands
open
wide
and
all
along
the
golden
road
from
those
fair
mansions
of
their
god
where
they
abide
dear
memories
of
the
days
that
were
i
see
the
shadows
ride
ghosts
the
sky
is
overcast
the
wind
wails
loud
grey
ghosts
go
driving
past
in
driving
cloud
and
in
the
beating
rain
against
the
dead
fingers
beat
again
dead
faces
crowd
o
grey
ghosts
waiting
still
my
fire
burns
bright
without
is
cold
and
chill
here
warm
and
light
and
would
you
have
me
creep
outside
to
you
and
sweep
with
you
along
the
steep
of
the
grey
night
nay
once
i
held
you
dear
before
you
fled
adown
the
shadowy
drear
paths
of
the
dead
but
now
the
churchyard
mould
has
left
you
all
too
cold
your
hands
i
can
not
hold
your
touch
i
dread
yet
linger
patiently
ghosts
of
the
past
soon
there
shall
come
to
me
that
morn
chill
blast
that
calls
me
too
to
tread
those
ways
of
doubt
and
dread
and
numbered
with
the
dead
to
lie
at
last
our
lady
of
darkness
when
the
toils
of
the
day
are
over
and
the
sun
has
sunk
in
the
west
and
my
lips
are
tired
of
laughter
and
my
heart
is
heavy
for
rest
i
will
sit
awhile
in
the
shadows
till
our
lady
of
darkness
shall
shed
the
healing
balms
of
her
silence
and
her
dreams
upon
my
head
ye
seek
in
vain
in
your
temples
she
dwells
not
in
aisles
of
stone
apart
and
at
peace
and
silent
she
waits
in
the
night
alone
her
eyes
are
as
moonlit
waters
her
brows
with
the
stars
are
bound
and
her
footsteps
move
to
music
but
no
man
has
heard
the
sound
no
incense
burns
at
her
altar
at
her
shrine
no
lamplight
gleams
but
she
guards
the
fountains
of
quiet
and
she
keeps
the
key
of
dreams
and
i
will
sit
in
the
shadows
and
pray
her
of
her
grace
to
open
her
guarded
visions
and
grant
me
to
dream
of
your
face
i
ask
not
to
break
the
silence
but
only
that
you
shall
stand
as
oft
you
stood
in
the
with
your
hand
upon
my
hand
so
i
will
sit
very
quiet
that
our
lady
of
darkness
may
shed
her
balms
of
healing
and
silence
and
of
dreams
upon
my
head
daluan
daluan
the
shepherd
when
winter
winds
blow
chill
goes
piping
the
upland
goes
piping
by
the
rill
and
whoso
hears
his
music
must
follow
where
he
will
daluan
the
shepherd
so
the
old
story
saith
he
pipes
the
tunes
of
laughter
the
songs
of
sighing
breath
he
pipes
the
souls
of
mortals
through
the
dark
gates
of
death
daluan
the
shepherd
who
listens
to
his
strain
shall
look
no
more
on
laughter
shall
taste
no
more
of
pain
shall
know
no
more
the
longing
that
eats
at
heart
and
brain
daluan
the
shepherd
beside
the
sobbing
rill
and
through
the
dripping
woodlands
and
up
the
gusty
hill
i
hear
the
pipes
of
daluan
crying
and
calling
still
dead
and
living
if
we
should
tap
on
your
pane
dear
standing
here
in
the
dark
outside
as
in
the
days
and
bright
dear
say
would
you
fling
the
window
wide
nay
you
would
turn
to
the
firelight
gold
dear
saying
is
but
a
dream
that
fled
deep
we
lie
in
the
churchyard
mould
dear
who
shall
remember
to
love
the
dead
ah
the
dead
who
shall
come
no
more
dear
gone
and
forgotten
so
you
say
standing
here
in
the
dark
at
your
door
dear
dead
and
forgotten
and
gone
for
aye
your
hours
pass
with
laughter
and
song
dear
do
we
blame
you
that
you
forget
all
our
years
are
empty
and
long
dear
we
in
our
graves
remember
yet
we
remember
and
ofttimes
rise
dear
from
our
beds
the
churchyard
sod
walking
ever
with
wistful
eyes
dear
ways
that
in
life
we
trod
we
remember
who
are
forgot
dear
do
we
blame
you
that
you
forget
how
should
we
live
in
your
lightest
thought
dear
only
the
dead
remember
yet
do
we
forget
we
can
not
hear
your
call
your
tap
upon
the
pane
sounds
to
our
ears
but
as
the
leaves
that
fall
or
beat
of
sobbing
rain
we
can
not
see
you
standing
at
the
door
or
passing
through
the
gloom
we
strain
our
ears
yet
hear
your
step
no
more
in
the
familiar
room
and
seeing
not
but
waiting
with
a
numb
bewildered
heart
and
brain
and
hearing
not
but
only
winds
that
come
and
wail
against
the
pane
and
dreaming
of
you
in
some
brighter
sphere
we
we
too
grieve
and
fret
that
you
whom
still
we
hold
so
dear
so
dear
should
all
so
soon
forget
the
master
of
shadows
into
the
western
waters
slow
sinks
the
sunset
light
and
the
voice
of
the
wind
of
shadows
calls
to
my
heart
calls
from
the
magic
countries
the
lost
and
the
lovely
lands
where
stands
the
master
of
shadows
holding
the
dreams
in
his
hands
all
the
dreams
of
the
ages
gather
around
him
there
visions
of
things
forgotten
and
of
things
that
never
were
birds
in
the
swaying
woodlands
creatures
furry
and
small
turn
to
the
master
of
shadows
and
he
gives
of
his
dreams
to
all
lo
i
am
worn
and
weary
sick
of
the
garish
light
blow
thou
wind
of
the
shadows
into
my
heart
out
of
the
magic
countries
the
lost
and
the
lovely
lands
where
he
the
master
of
shadows
waits
with
the
dreams
in
his
hands
au
through
the
sere
woods
she
walks
alone
with
bow
unstrung
and
empty
quiver
her
hounds
are
dead
her
maidens
gone
she
walks
alone
forever
watching
the
while
with
wistful
eyes
her
crescent
shining
in
the
skies
the
flutes
of
pan
are
silent
now
hushed
is
the
sound
of
faunus
singing
through
winds
that
shake
the
withering
bough
no
dryad
voice
is
ringing
syrinx
has
left
her
river
deep
old
silenus
sound
doth
sleep
the
startled
deer
before
her
flee
the
nightingales
with
music
meet
her
yet
never
mortal
eye
shall
see
or
mortal
voices
greet
her
her
shrines
with
weeds
are
overgrown
their
fires
are
out
their
worship
done
yet
sometimes
so
was
told
to
me
the
children
playing
in
the
meadows
may
hear
her
song
that
mournfully
comes
floating
through
the
shadows
and
sometimes
see
through
boughs
grown
bare
the
moonlit
brightness
of
her
hair
and
it
may
be
her
weary
feet
white
gleaming
through
those
dusky
spaces
may
after
many
wanderings
meet
the
dear
familiar
places
and
find
beyond
the
sunset
gold
ghosts
of
the
gods
she
knew
of
old
the
red
horse
he
came
and
whinnied
at
my
door
the
wild
red
horse
with
flowing
mane
and
i
i
crossed
the
threshold
leaving
behind
my
wonted
life
and
hope
of
joy
and
fear
of
pain
and
clasp
of
friend
and
kiss
of
wife
and
clinging
touch
of
childish
hands
and
love
and
laughter
grief
and
glee
and
rode
him
out
across
the
sands
beside
a
dark
mysterious
sea
across
my
face
his
mane
was
blown
i
saw
the
eddying
stars
grow
dim
and
suddenly
the
past
had
grown
a
dream
of
weariness
gone
by
and
i
was
fain
to
ride
with
him
forever
up
a
darkening
sky
and
hear
the
far
thin
fairy
tune
that
through
the
darkness
seemed
to
beat
until
at
length
the
crescent
moon
was
lying
underneath
our
feet
and
there
the
unknown
beaches
lay
with
stars
for
silvery
pebbles
strown
and
thin
and
faint
and
far
away
came
all
the
noises
of
the
world
and
up
those
glimmering
reaches
blown
the
whispering
waves
of
darkness
curled
and
there
my
wild
steed
paused
at
last
and
there
wrapped
round
in
dreams
i
lie
and
in
the
wind
that
whistles
past
i
hear
a
far
faint
fairy
cry
the
adventurers
we
rode
from
the
north
a
valiant
band
with
shining
armour
and
swords
aflame
till
we
came
at
length
to
a
silent
land
to
a
sunless
shadowy
land
we
came
a
desolate
land
without
a
name
no
songs
of
birds
in
that
land
were
known
no
voices
of
human
joy
or
pain
but
mists
on
the
silent
winds
were
blown
and
shadows
clung
to
our
bridle
rein
dim
forms
that
no
answer
gave
again
then
some
grew
tired
of
those
weary
ways
and
hied
them
back
to
a
happier
coast
and
many
followed
some
phantom
face
down
one
of
the
winding
ways
that
crossed
that
shadowy
land
and
so
were
lost
and
the
rust
grew
red
on
our
harness
bright
and
dull
grew
our
swords
and
a
dream
the
quest
and
ever
wearier
grew
the
fight
with
thronging
phantoms
that
round
us
pressed
and
ever
our
hearts
grew
sick
for
rest
till
few
and
feeble
who
were
so
strong
weary
who
dreamed
we
could
never
tire
we
won
at
last
through
those
ways
so
long
and
bathed
in
the
sunset
dome
and
spire
we
saw
the
city
of
heart
desire
the
watcher
of
the
threshold
silent
amid
the
shadows
outside
my
door
the
watcher
of
the
threshold
waits
evermore
one
day
the
door
will
open
and
i
shall
see
the
watcher
of
the
threshold
beckon
to
me
and
i
must
leave
the
firelight
and
seek
the
gloom
where
stands
that
shadowy
figure
outside
my
room
in
vain
it
is
to
question
of
how
or
why
the
watcher
of
the
threshold
makes
no
reply
only
amid
the
shadows
silent
he
stands
with
eyes
that
hold
a
secret
and
folded
hands
still
standing
in
the
darkness
outside
my
door
the
watcher
of
the
threshold
waits
evermore
the
grey
rider
why
ride
so
fast
through
the
wind
and
rain
grey
rider
of
the
shee
lest
a
soul
should
call
for
me
in
vain
o
vanathee

shall
seek
thine
aid

rider
of
the

is
sore
afraid
o

he
the

and

of
the

the
dread
that
sears
his
brain
o

he
fear
the

of
clanging
blows
grey
rider
of
the

nay
darker
still
is
the
fear
he
knows
o
vanathee
does
he
fear
the
loss
of

or

grey
rider
of
the

a

him
that

more
wild
o

o
what

him
so
sore

rider
of

with
her
great

girt
at

sheen
of

around

see
her
thus
in

never
the
old
domremy

knew
here
she
walks
as
a
maiden
shy
and
slender
brushing
with
bare
brown
feet
the
evening
dew
oft
do
the
children
playing
in

her
watching
them
white
and

fair
smiling

loved
so
in

bend
unto

whence
once
long
since

riding
riding
all
in

riding
down
scented

on

blowing
gaily
the

were
swinging
flags
were
waving
and
flowers
were
strown

lay
in

roses
rained
from
the
casements
them
all
in
the
streets
with
shout
and
singing
prayed
that
the
king
might
win
his
own
rupert
soldiers
came
riding
riding
all
in
the
darkness
riding
down
never
a
chimed
to
greet
them
never
a

came
forth
to
meet
them
broken
defeated
they
came
riding
through

never
more
while
the

come
riding
down
they
have

i
see
in

sun
or
shadow
rupert
soldiers
across
the
meadow
banners
blowing
and
lovelocks
streaming
riding
back
from
the
long
ago
and
in
my
dreams
they
still
are
riding
victor
or
vanquished
riding
down
now
with
the
roses
strewn
before
them
now
with
the
darkness
gathering
them
rupert

a
christmas
carol
just
a
little
baby
lying
in
a
manger
god
of
gods
and
light
of
lights
the
mighty
king
of
kings
hark
the
choiring
angels
chant
their
glad
evangels
all
the
air
is
pulsing
with
the
music
of
their
wings
just
a
little
baby
on
mary
breast
that
bore
him
helpless
feet
and
clinging
hands
and
lips
that
knew
no
word
and
the
darkness
ringing
with
the
angels
singing
sounding
through
the
solemn
night
all
glory
to
the
lord
just
a
little
baby
wrapped
in
swaddling
clothing
all
the
earth
forever
thrills
rejoicing
in
that
birth
through
the
centuries
flying
still
hears
those
angels
crying
glory
be
to
god
on
high
and
peace
goodwill
to
earth
lord
from
this
that
we
have
built
this
dark
abode
of
pain
and
misery
failure
and
guilt
we
stretch
our
hands
we
stretch
our
hands
to
thee
lord
set
us
free
o
lord
thou
knowest
all
thou
knowest
well
the
groping
hands
the
eyes
that
would
not
see
the
feet
that
fell
yet
are
we
fain
are
fain
to
come
to
thee
lord
set
us
free
bitter
the
chains
that
we
have
borne
so
long
the
chains
of
sin
we
wove
so
heedlessly
lo
thou
art
strong
out
of
the
deeps
we
cry
we
cry
to
thee
lord
set
us
free
the
cry
of
the
damned
have
you
no
pity
for
us
you
who
stand
within
that
heaven
that
we
may
never
win
who
know
the
golden
streets
of
that
fair
land
our
weary
feet
are
fain
to
be
within
have
you
no
ruth
for
us
who
must
abide
in
the
great
horror
of
the
night
outside
we
too
once
knew
of
laughter
and
delight
who
now
must
walk
these
weary
roads
of
pain
our
hearts
were
pure
as
yours
our
faces
bright
in
that
glad
life
we
may
not
know
again
we
might
have
gained
your
heaven
too
even
we
who
dwell
with
madness
and
with
memory
within
the
pleasant
pastures
where
your
feet
stray
comes
there
never
thought
of
our
distress
do
our
wails
never
mar
your
music
sweet
our
parched
throats
change
your
draught
to
bitterness
your
chance
was
ours
we
lost
it
yes
we
know
ours
was
the
fault
but
is
it
easier
so
yet
was
it
ours
the
dazzled
eyes
and
blind
the
wills
that
knew
but
could
not
hold
the
good
the
groping
feet
that
failed
the
path
to
find
the
wild
desires
that
filled
the
tainted
blood
have
you
no
ruth
who
those
bright
barriers
crossed
for
us
who
saw
them
open
and
are
lost
our
lady
of
remembrance
she
stoops
to
us
from
her
dim
recess
with
weary
and
wistful
eyes
she
has
grown
so
tired
of
the
censer
swing
of
the
choir
and
the
songs
they
sing
of
the
priest
pale
hand
upraised
to
bless
and
the
feast
and
the
sacrifice
they
bow
to
her
as
the
mother
blest
of
the
great
and
awful
god
but
her
heart
holds
dearest
his
early
years
the
childish
laughter
the
childish
tears
ere
his
feet
had
the
road
of
sorrows
pressed
or
the
way
to
the
cross
had
trod
her
thoughts
go
back
to
the
days
of
yore
away
from
the
garish
light
and
the
organ
droning
melody
to
the
starry
shores
of
galilee
to
the
vines
that
shaded
her
cottage
door
and
the
hush
of
the
eastern
night
so
she
bends
to
us
from
her
dim
recess
with
weary
and
wistful
eyes
and
turns
away
from
the
tapers
light
to
dream
of
the
cool
and
the
hush
of
night
from
the
priest
pale
hand
upraised
to
bless
to
the
starry
eastern
skies
maid
mary
maid
mary
sat
at
her
cottage
door
by
the
lake
of
galilee
tall
and
stately
her
lilies
were
but
never
was
lily
so
fair
or
half
so
pure
as
she
o
mary
maid
and
mother
of
god
i
pray
you
pray
for
me
the
shadows
darkened
along
the
shore
of
the
lake
of
galilee
what
steps
were
those
as
the
twilight
fell
lo
god
great
angel
gabriel
hail
blessed
of
god
spake
he
o
gabriel
prince
of
the
hosts
of
god
i
pray
you
pray
for
me
maid
mary
knelt
on
her
cottage
floor
by
the
lake
of
galilee
and
kneeling
dreamed
strange
dreams
and
sweet
of
baby
fingers
and
dimpled
feet
and
a
holy
thing
to
be
o
christ
the
son
of
god
i
pray
you
pray
for
me
but
she
did
not
dream
as
the
night
passed
by
the
lake
of
galilee
of
the
weary
ways
that
the
feet
should
tread
of
a
thorny
crown
for
a
baby
head
or
a
cross
on
calvary
o
son
of
mary
o
god
i
pray
you
pray
for
me
the
two
crowns
the
young
king
rode
through
the
city
street
so
gallant
gay
and
bold
there
were
roses
strewn
his
horse
feet
his
brows
were
bound
with
gold
and
his
heart
was
glad
for
his
people
cheers
along
his
pathway
rolled
glad
was
his
heart
and
bright
his
face
for
life
and
youth
were
fair
and
he
rode
through
many
a
pleasant
place
broad
street
and
sunny
square
till
he
came
to
the
and
saw
a
crucifix
stand
there
hushed
were
the
crowd
exultant
cries
to
silence
grown
for
they
saw
the
young
king
laughing
eyes
grow
grave
beneath
his
crown
as
the
crownéd
king
looked
up
for
lo
a
crownéd
king
looked
down
grave
were
the
eyes
above
and
sad
the
face
with
pain
was
lined
and
the
piercéd
hands
no
sceptre
had
both
brows
a
crown
did
bind
but
the
earthly
king
was
crowned
with
gold
the
christ
with
thorns
entwined
slowly
the
young
king
homeward
rode
in
awe
and
wondering
he
had
looked
that
day
on
the
face
of
god
and
learned
that
for
a
king
the
lordliest
crown
his
brows
can
bear
is
the
crown
of
suffering
a
sparrow
in
church
thou
who
hast
said
no
sparrow
shall
fall
without
thy
knowledge
lend
me
now
thine
aid
i
cry
to
thee
o
mighty
lord
of
all
thy
little
living
creature
sore
afraid
all
my
short
life
these
fluttering
wings
have
known
only
the
freedom
of
thy
sun
and
rain
and
now
they
beat
against
these
walls
of
stone
lord
of
the
sparrows
shall
they
beat
in
vain
the
terrors
of
thine
house
encompass
me
upon
thine
altar
i
myself
have
laid
hearken
o
lord
thy
sparrow
calls
to
thee
thy
little
living
creature
sore
afraid
where
the
dark
green
hollows
lift
into
crests
of
snow
wheeling
flashing
floating
by
white
against
the
stormy
sky
with
exultant
call
and
cry
swift
the
go
fearless
vagabond
and
free
children
of
the
spray
spirits
of
old
mariners
drifting
down
the
restless
years
drake
and
hawkins
buccaneers
so
do
say
watching
guarding
sailing
still
round
the
shores
they
knew
where
the
cliffs
of
devon
rise
red
against
the
sullen
skies
dearer
far
than
paradise
the
tossing
blue
not
for
them
the
heavenly
song
sweeter
still
they
find
than
those
angels
row
on
row
thunder
of
the
bursting
snow
seething
on
the
rocks
below
singing
of
the
wind
fairer
than
the
streets
of
gold
those
wild
fields
of
foam
where
the
horses
of
the
sea
stamp
and
whinny
ceaselessly
warding
from
all
enemy
shores
they
once
called
home
so
the
call
and
cry
the
cliffs
spirits
of
old
mariners
drifting
down
the
restless
years
drake
and
hawkins
buccaneers
so
do
say
my
dog
and
i
my
dog
and
i
the
hills
we
know
where
the
first
faint
wild
roses
blow
we
know
the
shadowy
paths
and
cool
that
wind
across
the
woodland
dim
and
where
the
water
beetles
swim
upon
the
surface
of
the
pool
my
dog
and
i
our
feet
brush
through
full
oft
the
fragrant
morning
dew
or
when
the
summer
sun
is
high
we
linger
where
the
river
flows
chattering
and
chuckling
as
it
goes
two
happy
tramps
my
dog
and
i
or
when
the
winter
snows
are
deep
into
some
nook
we
creep
and
while
the
north
wind
howls
outside
see
castles
in
the
dancing
blaze
or
dozing
dream
of
summer
days
and
woodland
stretches
wild
and
wide
my
dog
and
i
are
friends
till
death
and
when
the
chill
dark
angel
breath
shall
call
him
from
me
still

in
the

where
the

breaks
in
flame
spring
with
all
the
daffodils
on

october
wind
the
piper
wind
goes
straying
into
the
morning
skies
with
fern
seed
in
his
pocket
and
laughter
in
his
eyes
and
the
swift
clouds
break
and
follow
his
magic
melodies
the
piper
wind
goes
playing
his
music
sweet
and
shrill
and
brave
in
red
and
yellow
the
leaves
dance
on
the
hill
and
the
purple
plumes
of
aster
nod
gaily
by
the
rill
the
piper
wind
goes
roaming
upland
glade
and
plain
he
whispers
to
the
sunshine
he
whistles
through
the
rain
he
dreams
among
the
pine
trees
and
wakes
and
laughs
again
the
piper
wind
goes
homing
adown
the
sunset
skies
with
fern
seed
in
his
pocket
and
laughter
in
his
eyes
and
our
hearts
are
fain
to
follow
his
magic
melodies
october
now
when
the
summer
flowers
are
past
and
dead
and
from
the
earth
wild
bosom
brown
and
bare
no
trillium
lifts
its
head
when
in
the
hollows
where
the
violets
were
purple
and
white
and
fair
only
a
few
brown
leaves
are
falling
now
the
wind
shakes
from
the
bough
now
when
the
flame
no
more
burns
in
the
long
lush
grasses
on
the
hill
and
by
the
river
shore
the
smoky
trail
of
asters
lingering
still
thins
and
the
air
grows
chill
with
the
first
feathery
snowflakes
that
anon
fall
softly
and
are
gone
o
let
us
leave
this
dull
and
dusty
street
the
noise
and
heat
and
turmoil
of
the
town
for
country
waysides
sweet
lanes
where
the
nuts
are
clustering
plump
and
brown
hedges
blackberries
crown
come
ere
the
shivering
blasts
of
winter
blow
let
us
make
haste
and
go
in
arcadie
heart
of
my
heart
the
long
road
lies
a
streak
of
white
across
the
down
to
where
the
touch
the
skies
then
let
us
seek
the
mountain
crown
and
cross
its
summit
bare
and
brown
heart
of
my
heart
o
come
with
me
to
walk
the
ways
of
arcadie
heart
of
my
heart
right
merrily
the
little
winds
of
springtime
blow
the
air
is
full
of
melody
the
birds
are
singing
soft
and
low
heart
of
my
heart
then
let
us
go
across
the
hills
and
wander
free
the
pleasant
paths
of
arcadie
there
sunny
land
and
sunny
sea
lie
drowsing
in
the
noontide
heat
there
song
of
bird
and
hum
of
bee
mix
in
a
music
wild
and
sweet
and
in
the
thyme
beneath
our
feet
cicalas
chirp
their
melody
across
the
hills
in
arcadie
or
when
the
twilight
shadows
steep
the
with
a
misty
light
and
stars
their
quiet
watches
keep
through
the
short
hours
of
summer
night
and
burn
their
lanterns
bright
the
streams
still
murmur
sleepily
across
the
hills
in
arcadie
heart
of
my
heart
o
let
us
leave
the
toil
and
turmoil
of
the
town
and
men
that
work
and
men
that
grieve
and
take
the
road
across
the
down
and
climb
the
bare
and
brown
heart
of
my
heart
o
come
with
me
to
walk
the
ways

james
whitcomb
riley
wave
your
hand
to
him
let
him
go
back
from
the
dusty
paths
we
stray
to
the
land
where
his
boyhood
rivers
flow
he
is
not
dead
he
is
just
away
gone
to
laugh
at
ann
and
swap
old
yarns
with
the
raggedy
man
hush
do
you
hear
in
the
distance
dim
faint
and
sweet
as
an
elfin
tune
orphant
annie
is
calling
him
counting
him
in
with
the
rune
intry

corn
apple
blossom
and
apple
thorn
wave
your
hand
to
him
call
faintly
his
answer
echoes
back
voices
of
children
eagerly
lure
him
on
by
the
fairy
track
to
the
where
all
hearts
are
gay
he
is
not
dead
he
is
just
away
the
sandman
when
the
long
hot
day
is
over
and
the
sun
drops
down
the
west
and
the
childish
hands
are
weary
and
the
childish
feet
must
rest
the
sandman
steals
through
the
portals
where
the
dying
sunlight
gleams
and
touches
the
tired
eyelids
and
lulls
them
into
dreams
even
so
when
life
is
over
and
the
long
day
march
is
past
we
wait
in
gathering
shadows
till
the
sandman
comes
at
last
sad
are
our
hearts
and
weary
and
long
the
waiting
seems
lord
we
are
tired
children
touch
thou
our
eyes
with
dreams
take
from
the
slackened
fingers
the
toys
so
heavy
grown
give
to
thy
tired
children
visions
of
thee
alone
then
when
at
length
the
shadows
darken
adown
the
west
send
to
us
death
thy
sandman
to
call
thine
own
to
rest
the
remittance
men
she
stands
in
peace
by
her
waters
our
mother
fair
and
wise
and
ever
amid
our
dreaming
we
see
her
hills
arise
we
who
have
sold
our
birthright
sons
who
have
failed
at
need
outcast
lost
and
dishonoured
we
know
her
fair
indeed
yes
we
have
sold
our
birthright
well
have
we
learned
the
cost
hateful
bodies
and
souls
forever
lost
we
see
the
heights
above
us
the
depths
into
which
we
fall
and
we
turn
from
that
sight
in
horror
drinking
to
drown
it
all
lo
we
have
lost
her
forever
exiled
unclean
alone
yet
she
was
once
our
mother
once
we
were
sons
of
her
own
we
who
have
failed
her
and
shamed
her
cast
from
her
shores
so
long
still
in
our
dreams
we
see
her
noble
and
wise
and
strong
once
in
a
country
we
named
her
great
and
fair
they
mocked
us
with
scornful
laughter
lo
these
are
the
sons
she
bare
do
we
not
feel
our
bondage
we
who
have
owned
her
name
when
we
dare
not
whisper
her
praises
lest
we
whelm
her
in
our
shame
yet
do
the
outcasts
love
her
who
once
were
bone
of
her
bone
pray
for
her
life
and
honour
who
dare
not
pray
for
their
own
out
of
the
hell
we
have
chosen
watch
her
with
longing
eyes
she
who
was
once
our
mother
excellent
just
and
wise
the
last
voyage
when
i
loose
my
vessel
moorings
and
put
out
to
sea
once
more
on
the
last
and
longest
voyage
that
shall
never
reach
the
shore
o
thou
master
of
the
ocean
send
no
tranquil
tides
to
me
but
all
thy
floods
and
thunders
let
my
vessel
put
to
sea
let
her
lie
within
no
tropic
sea
dead
rotten
to
the
bone
till
the
lisping
sluggish
waters
claim
my
vessel
for
their
own
till
the
sun
shall
scar
her
timbers
and
the
slimy
weed
shall
crawl
her
planks
that
gape
and
widen
and
the
slow
sea
swallow
all
let
her
not
go
down
in
darkness
where
the
smoking
hide
the
white
signal
of
the
breakers
dimly
guessed
at
overside
while
her
decks
are
in
confusion
and
the
wreck
drops
momently
and
she
drifts
in
dark
and
panic
to
the
death
she
can
not
see
but
out
in
the
open
ocean
where
the
great
waves
call
and
cry
leap
and
thunder
at
her
taffrail
while
the
scud
blows
stinging
by
with
the
life
still
strong
within
her
struggling
onward
through
the
blast
till
one
last
long
wave
shall
whelm
her
and
our
voyaging
is
past
ballade
of
dreams
we
dreamed
our
dreams
in
full
many
lands
by
mount
and
forest
by
stream
and
lea
dreams
of
the
touch
of
hands
dreams
of
a
future
destiny
dreams
of
battle
and
victory
laughter
and
love
and
wealth
and
fame
dreamers
of

indeed
were
we
have
the
lichens

our
rivers
of

had
golden

our
forests
of
dream
waved
fair
to
see
our
dreamland
isles
were
enchanted
strands
with
shores
of
magic
and
mystery
how
should
we
dream
of
misery
with
the
blood
of
youth
at
our
hearts
aflame
dreamers
of
dreams
indeed
were
we
have
the
lichens
yet
our

if
a
mortal
now
our
fate
demands
we
who
so
long
forgotten
be
he
shall
seek
in
vain
for
our
wandering
bands
now
wait
here
all
so
dreamlessly
o
the
restless
hearts
rest
quietly
and
the
fire
is
quenched
that
no
frost
could
tame
dreamers
of
dreams
indeed
were
we
have
the
lichens
yet
our
name

this
world
is
all
vanity
and

and

the

of

wild
and
wide
i
am
tired
so
tired
of
hill
and
plain
and
the
dull
tame
face
of
the
country
side
i
will
go
out
across
the
bar
with
a
swoop
like
the
flight
of
a
wings
to
where
the
winds
and
the
waters
are
with
their
multitudinous
thunderings
my
prows
shall
furrow
the
whitening
sea
out
into
the
teeth
of
the
lashing
wind
where
a
thousand
billows
snarl
and
flee
and
break
in
a
smother
of
foam
behind
o
strong
and
terrible
mother
sea
let
me
lie
once
more
on
your
cool
white
breast
your
winds
have
blown
through
the
heart
of
me
and
called
me
back
from
the
land
dull
rest
for
night
by
night
they
blow
through
my
sleep
the
voice
of
waves
through
my
slumber
rings
i
feel
the
spell
of
the
steadfast
deep
i
hear
its
tramplings
and
triumphings
and
at
last
when
my
hours
of
life
are
sped
let
them
make
me
no
grave
by
hill
or
plain
thy
waves
o
mother
shall
guard
my
head
i
will
go
down
to
my
sea
again
the
i
am
weary
of
this
country
with
its
hedges
and
its
walls
and
all
night
i
do
be
dreaming
how
the
water
calls
and
calls
of
the
booming
of
the
breakers
as
they
dash
against
the
shore
and
the
salt
wind
the
the
wind
i
hear
no
more
i
am
weary
of
these
meadows
where
the
sun
comes
scorching
down
till
the
ways
are
dry
and
dusty
and
the
grass
is
burnt
and
brown
and
forever
through
my
dreaming
come
the
great
waves
lash
and
leap
and
the
salt
wind
the
the
wind
upon
the
deep
should
i
die
here
in
this
country
and
its
stifling
turf
be
pressed
hot
and
heavy
my
bosom
o
is
never
i
could
rest
let
me
lie
beneath
the
washing
of
the
green
and
silent
wave
with
the
salt
wind

to
sing
above
my
grave
my
philosophy
life
is
a
game
that
all
must
play

you
win
or

though
you
gain
or
pay
whatever
the
cards
you
hold
i
say
throw
back
your

keep
youth
fire
at
your
heart
aglow
a
clasp
for
a
friend
and
a
fist
for

and
then
let
come
or
joy
or
woe
throw
back
your

laugh
though

upon
you
frown

though
the

soul
shall
drown
many
a

goes
down

easter
thomas
he
died
for
thee
o
mournful
mother
erin
a
year
ago
he
turned
his
face
away
from
the
glad
spring
in
her
young
green
appearing
he
lingered
not
to
listen
to
the
lay
of
thrush
or
blackbird
turned
him
not
aside
to
watch
the
glory
of
the
daffodils
that
shone
and
fluttered
on
a
hundred
hills
but
where
the
mists
had
gathered
chill
and
grey
he
chose
his
path
and
died
and
now
another
spring
makes
green
the
meadows
the
daffodils
are
golden
once
again
the
little
winds
are
dancing
with
the
shadows
the
young
leaves
make
once
more
the
world
is
fain
of
life
and
laughter
but
he
shall
not
see
the
hollows
where
the
violets
grow
or
watch
the
hawthorn
buds
foam
into
snow
no
more
shall
feel
the
warm
soft
springtime
rain
for
he
has
died
for
thee
and
yet
this
year
all
the
spring
rejoicing
there
sounds
at
times
i
think
a
sadder
note
this
spring
no
longer
is
the
blackbird
voicing
such
jubilation
from
his
golden
throat
the
winds
grown
older
dance
with
feet
of
lead
the
daffodils
are
nodding
listlessly
the
violet
has
no
perfume
for
the
bee
the
grasshopper
has
donned
his
dullest
coat
remembering
he
is
dead
yet
once
again
o
thrush
break
into
singing
laugh
daffodils
to
feel
the
falling
rain
winter
is
past
and
the
young
earth
is
springing
joyous
to
greet
her
risen
lord
again
and
he
who
loved
you
deem
not
that
he
lies
unheeding
of
your
grief
beneath
his
mound
no
more
the
sleep
of
death
enwraps
him
round

o
erin
death
is
slain
but
valour
never

the

the
faith
that
man
has
pledged

their

with

for
ere
the
bells

swing
their

shall
clasp
with

though
gregory
lies
where

ah
golden
youths
who
leave
for

your
ports
of
quiet
breath
turning
your
prows
from
life
familiar
shore
forth
with
adventurous
death
with
that
great
comrade
sailing

your

straining
through
the

our
spirits
trace
a
glory
lingering
on
farewell
great
fellowship
sail
on
nor
mourn
your
ports
of
quiet
breath
your
prows
with
singing
and
with
laughter
turn
forth
with
adventurous
death
a
song
of
exile

bringing
to
us
faint
odours
from
lanes
we
used
to
know
lanes
where
the
hawthorn
hedges
foam
into

white
what

the

of
england
for
england
sons
what
is
the
news
of
england
her
white
cliffs
the
sea
croons
its
soft
song
of
summer
the
golden
days
to
be
her
hills
are
fair
with
promise
her
woods
with
voices
ring
from
every
copse
the
cuckoo
shouts
to
the
jocund
spring
what

the

of
england
once
more
the

gleams
gold
in

meadows
gold
by

murmuring

once

secrets
of
delight
from
the
great
heart
of

to
england
sons
the
we
brought
great

to
birth
we
builded
towns

lords
of
the
sea
and
earth
soon
shall
the
sky
be
ours
soon
shall
our
navies
drift
like
swallows
down
the
wind
shall
wheel
and
swoop
and
lift
leaving
the
clouds
behind
the
stars
our
keels
shall
know
the
eagle
as
it
flies
shall
scream
to
see
us
go
swift
moving
through
the

high
the
our
wingèd
fleets
shall
sail
the

down

we
are
the

built
us

soon
shall

be
ours
the
defeated
cheer
if
you
will
the
brave
deed
done
with
laurels
the
victor
crown
but
keep
one
leaf
of
your
wreath
of
bay
for
the
men
who
lost
and
are
down
for
the
fight
in
vain
for
the
cankered
grain
that
in
blood
and
tears
was
sown
honour
the
strong
of
heart
and
hand
the
sure
of
will
and
of
sight
but
what
of
the
stumbling
feet
the
eyes
that
strain
in
vain
for
light
is
there
no
gain
for
the
tears
and
pain
of
the
men
who
fell
in
the
fight
beaten
baffled
with
standards
lost
knowing
no
rallying
cry
struggling
still
but
with
failing
strength
while
stronger
men
pass
by
keep
ye
your
bays
i
give
my
praise
to
the
men
who
lose
and
die
the
gentlemen
of
oxford
the
sunny
streets
of
oxford
are
lying
still
and
bare
no
sound
of
voice
or
laughter
rings
through
the
golden
air
and
chiming
from
her
belfry
no
longer
christchurch
calls
the
eager
boyish
faces
to
gather
in
her
halls
the
colleges
are
empty
only
the
sun
and
wind
make
merry
in
the
places
the
lads
have
left
behind
but
when
the
trooping
shadows
have
put
the
day
to
flight
the
gentlemen
of
oxford
come
homing
through
the
night
from
france
they
come
and
flanders
from
mons

marne
and
aisne
from
greece
and
from
gallipoli
they
come
to

again
from
the

from

a

the
gentlemen
of

come
back
to

their
own
the
dark
is
full
of
laughter
boy
laughter
glad
and
young
they
tell
the
stories
the
songs
are
sung
they
linger
in
her
cloisters
they
throng
her
dewy
meads
till
isis
hears
their
calling
and
laughs
among
her
reeds
but
when
the
east
is
whitening
to
greet
the
rising
sun
and
slowly
over
carfax
the
stars
fade
one
by
one
then
when
the
whispers
along
the
isis

the
gentlemen
of
oxford
must
seek
their
graves
