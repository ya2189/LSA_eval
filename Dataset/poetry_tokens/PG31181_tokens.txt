exactly
onomatopoeia
one
thing
about
this
type
of
education
it
certainly
taught
an
individual
to
be
philosophical
about
death
he
could
ruminate
conversably
on
the

fate
of
a

shade

the

interpretation
of

even
contemplate

the

romantic
poetry
might
have
little
practical
application

it
was
great

stuff
a

two
by

sure
broke
the
ice
at

was

verbal
jousting

bad
the

was

really

what
onomatopoeia
was

that

was

worse

acted

the

the

it
did
too
have
importance
literature
that
is
why
it
gave
a
man
depth
a
presence
a
gracefulness
that
transcended
petty
material
strivings
too
bad

that
the

had
fallen

it
was
maddening
that
literary
civilization
was
within

at
being
snuffed
by
the
ordinary
convention

the

his
coffee
cup
eyes
some
primordial
forest
cut
for
a
firebreak
back
of
his
soul
and
i
think
of
the
desperate
those
lacking
to
get
to
such
a
carnival
valuable
postage
money
photocopying
scrimped
dollars
for
a
suit
to
entertain
the
pumpkins
dicing
for
a
worthless
garment
a
scavenger
run
piles
of
white
applications
heaped
as
bones
in
a
graveyard
made
careless
after
a
violent
storm
or
elephants
in
tow
trunks
wrapped
around
the
other
waiting
for
the
ringmaster
to
signal
the
question
important
whether
a
neophyte
new
at
sharpening
his
teeth
at
a
daily
wage
should
be
allowed
presence
onto
such
a
hallowed
ground
and
i
think
such
things
are
the
very
matter
of
evil
that
these
are
vile
intemperates
with
their
accursed
shortlists
deigning
to
be
gracious
shaking
hands
after
the
fact
mafioso
manners
the
sickly
grins
back
of
the
shovels
used
to
bury
another
men
of
shade
all
the
candles
are
passing
out
one
by
one
they
have
evaporated
their
brightness
overpowered
limpid
cracks
in
their
own
flames
seized
the
outpouring
air
with
hesitant
breath
to
brave
a
flicker
of
new
hearth
while
knocking
holes
against
the
warm
men
decorating
fireside
shade
a
book
like
a
life
whilst
you
walk
this
earth
yet
nothing
is
afoot
as
so
many
small
boys
throwing
stones
through
the
funeral
parlour
glass
door
a
being
alive
and
interacting
across
the
face
of
the
multitude
is
terrible
algebra
running
into
unfathomable
sums
doing
your
sums
my
grade
school
teacher
used
to
say
and
i
still
am
whippersnapper
learning
lessons
in
a
strange
stamina
sort
of
way
one
of
the
multitude
died
last
night
is
now
resting
in
a
large
victorian
parlour
even
the
walls
grimace
i
went
by
caught
a
peek
at
the
assemblage
chasing
thru
rain
to
see
his
last
hurrah
look
parlour
can
be
deadly
serious
even
if
and
pizza
attach
humour
to
the
term
imagine
picking
the
last
day
of
the
month
to
go
packing
finale
going
down
to
the
sea
in
ships
death
as
voyage
escaping
prison
confines
of
the
harbour
cliches
donate
dim
glimpses
into
the
apparent
one
sees
a
lot
by
the
moon
crisp
fall
air
and
leaves
yellowing
frightened
from
their
wits
to
end
their
brief
balloon
walk
such
faraway
faces
of
eve
and
a
boat
moored
to
a
dock
crossing
streets
a
gray
fusillade
church
breaks
the
night

chuckle
in

through
wispy

it

seems
to
be

ashamed
of
what
we
have
to
go
through
at
the
end
of
this
filth
and
stupidity
restrictions
death
lifts
them
in
one
heave
of
the
casket
more
illuminating
are
the
mourners
dashing
thru
the
sleet
in
brief
poignancy
shrill
old
voices
that
knew
the
deceased
reciting
what
can
only
be
the
obvious
leaden
eyes
that
cast
no
shadow
hardly
analogous
to
being
called
home
or
going
to
their
reward
more
light
is
cast
by
the
street
lamp
the
pale
glow
of
fireflies
and
neon
signs

like
the
cork
this
place
is
holy
to
me
a
shrine
night
air
with
mist
collecting
watching
flames
shuffle
over
leaves
mount
a
glade
the
bitterest
berry
flower
to
lily
of
the

a
heart
that
makes
gravelly
noise
tiny
angel
spread
of

no

standing

bargaining

acceptance
they

clangs
like

into

a

a

serenade
the

think
still

when

burst

this
is
done
in
preparation
for
brighter

ecstatically
greeting
november
chill
devouring
the

cursing
over

fire
a

crammed

carrying

rocketing

all

my

their

lavender

the

between

a

the

her

flaring

a

the

why
be
afraid
spume
from
waves
glows
upward
in
so
many
trails
of

this
island
looks
like
a
loaf
a
dot

mole
on
inviting
cheeks
to
me
so
wary
invariably
of

and
perhaps
the
sand
man
amongst
all
those
wandering

especially
the
curl
of

illuminated
in

sudden
tropic
shower

the
sudden
bandanna
of
rock
squeezed
so
tight
by
shore
edge
that
a
grim
hammer
of
stones
intones
a
warning
its
back
from
the
wars
to
dive
there
among
threads
of
water
where
needle
eyes
of
little
fish
young
fry
of
treachery
are
so
dunes
and
eddies
of
living
colour
shake
you
to
slake

thirst
for

for
precision

up
the

the

the
