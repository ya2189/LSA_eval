london
dawn
dawn
over
london
all
the
pearly
light
trembles
and
quivers
over
street
and
park
the
houses
are
a
strange
unearthly
white
pavement
and
roof
grow
slowly
palely
bright
there
is
no
shadow
neither
light
nor
dark
but
everything
is
steeped
in
glimmering
dawn
oh
purity
of
dawn
oh
translucent
splendour
spreading
far
and
wide
as
on
a
yellow
beach
the
small
waves
curl
almost
as
noiselessly
as
buds
unfurl
on
windless
mornings
with
the
rising
tide
so
flows
the
dawn
london
all
asleep
indeed
i
think
that
heaven
is
a
sea
and
london
is
a
city
of
old
rhymes
sunk
fathoms
deep
in
its
transparency
that
folk
of
living
lands
may
dream
they
see
and
muse
on
and
have
thoughts
about
our
times
how
we
were
great
and
splendid
and
now
gone
for
never
light
the
common
earth
has
born
this
crystalline
pale
wonder
that
so
falls
on
streets
and
squares
the
daily
toil
has
worn
on
houses
holding
lives
forlorn
for
the
grey
roads
and
wide
blank
walls
shine
with
a
glory
that
is
new
and
strange
and
not
more
wonderful
nor
otherwise
shall
dawn
come
up
upon
the
dewy
hills
nor
in
the
mountains
where
the
rivers
rise
that
water
eden
and
no
lovelier
lies
the
dawn
on
paradise
than
this
that
fills
the
space
house
and
house
with
tremulous
light
yet
on
the
pavement
huddled
fast
asleep
a
thing
of
dusty
ragged
misery
grotesque
in
wretchedness
from
london
deep
spumed
off
a
strange
distorted
thing
to
creep
from
god
knows
where
and
lie
and
let
all
be
unheeding
whether
of
the
day
or
night
such
tired
hopeless
angles
of
the
knees
and
neck
and
elbows
and
the
dawning
grey
trembling
to
sunrise
in
the
park
the
trees
begin
to
shiver
lightly
in
a
breeze
and
turning
watchful
kindly
eyes
away
the
policeman
passes
slowly
on
his
beat
spring
in
oxford
street
a
dash
of
rain
on
the
pavement
in
the
air
a
gleam
of
sun
and
the
clouds
are
white
and
rolling
high
from
marble
arch
all
down
the
sky
and
that
the
spring
begun
the
sky
is
all
with
sunniest
blue
and
white
the
flags
are
streaming
out
full
cry
as
the
crisp
north
wind
comes
bustling
by
and
all
the
roofs
are
bright
and
all
the
shops
and
houses
of
sunlit
oxford
street
pearl
behind
amber
gold
by
rose
to
grey
the
long
perspective
goes
till
all
the
houses
meet
and
there
in
every
gutter
the
glory
of
spring
flowers
the
whole
long
street
with
colour
fills
and
across
the
yellow
daffodils
sharp
sunshine
and
soft
showers
and
among
the
drabs
and
greys
and
browns
of
folk
going
to
and
fro
are
trays
of
violets
darkly
bright
and
yellow
like
the
spring
moon
light
pale
show
there
blue
in
every
puddle
and
every
pane
of
glass
has
a
thousand
little
dancing
suns
and
up
and
down
the
glad
news
runs
that
spring
has
come
to
pass
judd
street
pancras
my
dwelling
has
a
courtyard
wide
where
lord
with
lady
well
might
pace
such
silks
and
velvets
side
by
side
and
she
a
fan
to
shield
her
face
it
fine
as
any
king
for
there
i
see
on
either
hand
the
whole
great
stretch
of
london
lie
just
so
as
any
king
might
stand
upon
his
roof
to
watch
go
by
the
flashing
pigeon
wings
just
so
a
king
might
look
abroad
and
this
is
all
my
own
says
he
and
then
he
turn
to
some
great
lord
who
acquiesce
with
gravity
but
that
i
do
without
for
all
of
lord
there
is
up
here
is
this
impassive
and
cloudy
be
my
view
or
clear
my
courtier
will
not
answer
back
all
silent
i
look
out
and
see
the
flight
of
roofs
that
fade
towards
the
west
in
golden
haze
and
all
this
work
men
hands
have
made
like
jewels
in
the
sun
last
rays
i
have
a
dwelling
wide
three
rooms
are
mine
but
i
can
go
up
to
this
roof
in
shade
or
shine
and
watch
all
london
change
and
glow
rose
purple
gold
three
rooms
are
mine
and
all
of
heaven
beside
sparrows
brown
little
fat
little
cheerful
sparrows
i
like
to
think
when
i
hear
them
chatter
how
when
the
brazen
noise
was
gone
of
the
with
the
sparks
their
chirp
was
heard
in
old
babylon
in
babylon
and
more
ancient
memphis
they
chattered
and
quarrelled
pecked
and
fumed
and
loved
their
loves
and
flew
their
ways
where
the
royal
pharaohs
lay
entombed
deep
from
the
daylight
vulgar
gaze
then
just
such
little
homely
fellows
when
the
angry
monarch
terrible
watched
his
curled
assyrians
writhe
they
sat
on
a
carven
granite
bull
unheeding
of
anguish
feathered
and
blithe
so
did
they
sit
on
the
roofs
of
rome
and
preen
themselves
in
the
morning
sun
and
caesar
saw
them
brown
and
grey
whisk
in
the
dust
when
his
course
was
run
and
he
took
to
the
forum
his
fated
way
oh
changing
time
oh
sun
and
birds
how
little
changing
in
the
square
this
winter
morning
i
have
met
old
egypt
grandson
stopped
him
there
and
sir
you
will
outlive
me
yet
said
i
politely
mark
my
words
the
moon
in
january
sharp
and
straight
are
the
scaffold
poles
black
on
a
delicate
sky
upright
they
stand
across
they
lie
in
changeless
angles
fixed
and
bound
the
sunset
light
in
mist
is
drowned
and
the
moon
has
risen
high
high
above
houses
high
and
clear
above
the
scaffolding
so
exquisite
so
faint
a
thing
the
young
moon
silver
curve
that
shines
above
the
fretting
tangled
lines
with
the
old
moon
in
her
ring
the
young
moon
holds
the
old
black
moon
in
a
sky
all
grey
with
frost
by
cable
wires
barred
and
crossed
and
below
the
haze
of
smokes
upward
from
the
town
where
outlines
all
are
lost
the
pure
pale
arch
of
windless
sky
the
pure
bright
young
moon
thread
these
wide
and
still
are
overhead
and
in
the
dusky
glare
below
the
lamps
go
dotting
row
on
row
and
there
is
movement
to
and
fro
where
far
the
pavements
spread
an
august
night
the
light
has
gone
from
the
west
the
wind
has
gone
from
the
quiet
trees
in
the
park
from
the
houses
the
open
windows
yellowly
shine
the
streets
are
softly
dark
row
upon
row
the
twisted
chimneys
stand
each
angle
sharply
lined
and
the
mass
of
the
institute
rises
tower
and
dome
black
on
the
sky
behind
green
is
the
sky
like
some
strange
precious
stone
dark
it
yet
holds
the
light
in
its
depths
like
a
bright
thing
shrouded
over
or
veiled
by
the
creeping
shadow
of
night
and
whiter
than
any
whiteness
there
is
upon
earth
a
faint
star
throbs
and
beats
and
the
hurrying
voices
cry
the
news
of
the
war
below
in
the
quiet
street
counted
out
olympia
the
small
white
space
roped
off
the
hard
blue
light
burning
intensely
on
the
narrow
ring
and
every
muscle
movement
sculpturing
harshly
of
those
two
naked
men
who
fight
beyond
the
yellow
lights
that
seem
to
swing
across
abysmal
darkness
and
below
tier
upon
tier
all
silent
row
on
row
the
dense
throng
and
all
white
faces
turned
towards
the
narrow
stage
watching
intently
watching
nerves
and
brain
as
those
two
men
cut
off
in
that
blue
glare
from
all
reality
of
place
and
age
wherein
our
common
being
has
a
share
together
isolated
watch
and
creep
sunk
head
hunched
shoulders
light
of
foot
and
swift
deadly
of
purpose
in
that
ancient
game
which
was
not
otherwise
in
forests
deep
of
earth
primeval
that
light
tread
the
same
the
same
those
watchful
eyes
and
those
quick
springs
of
a
snake
uncoiling
underneath
the
skin
glistening
with
sweat
in
that
unearthly
blaze
the
muscles
run
and
check
like
living
things
and
then
the
hot
air
tremulous
with
the
din
and
all
the
great
crowd
surging
to
its
feet
yet
like
a
wave
arrested
while
the
hands
of
the
referee
allot
the
moments
beat
the
seconds
strung
like
greyhounds
on
a
leash
await
the
signal
and
there
one
who
stands
still
guarding
watchful
tense
while
all
around
and
darkness
seem
to
rock
and
spin
in
one
wild
clamour
and
upon
the
ground
beneath
the
stark
blue
light
the
beaten
man
the
german
band
when
i
was
a
little
child
and
lived
very
near
the
sky
a
german
band
was
wonderful
music
that
could
almost
make
me
cry
it
was
to
me
of
a
beauty
that
i
could
not
understand
though
i
dimly
guessed
at
sorrow
and
joy
in
a
distant
land
all
that
i
know
with
the
years
much
that
i
never
shall
know
was
in
my
heart
when
the
music
came
in
such
guise
years
ago
and
now
when
on
friday
mornings
i
hear
my
own
child
run
when
the
german
band
in
the
street
starts
playing
the
wonder
is
never
done
the
wonder
at
ways
that
our
spirit
may
take
for
itself
to
rise
how
a
puddle
may
be
a
silver
lake
and
a
chimney
touch
the
skies
all
the
forms
through
which
spirit
yearns
and
strives
to
be
known
are
only
a
little
greater
or
less
for
great
is
the
spirit
alone
street
music
i
there
comes
an
old
man
to
our
street
dragging
his
knobby
lame
old
feet
once
a
week
he
comes
and
stands
a
concertina
in
his
hands
there
in
the
gutter
stops
and
plays
no
matter
fine
or
rainy
days
very
humble
and
very
old
pavement
for
them
who
make
so
bold
prim
starched
nurses
and
ladies
fair
with
taffeta
dresses
and
shining
hair
and
gay
little
children
who
break
and
run
to
give
him
a
penny
he
seems
to
feel
and
that
they
a
right
to
the
morning
sun
and
so
with
gnarled
old
hands
he
play
for
an
hour
perhaps
then
take
his
way
dragging
his
knobby
lame
old
feet
in
the
gutter
of
this
quiet
street
there
is
no
grudging
in
his
eyes
nor
anger
nor
the
least
surprise
at
the
uneven
scales
of
fate
glad
of
the
sun
against
the
rain
hunching
his
shoulders
age
and
pain
he
takes
as
his
appointed
state
and
stands
like
lazarus
at
the
door
with
the
dread
humility
of
the
poor
street
music
ii
i
heard
a
mad
old
fiddler
play
harsh
discordant
broken
strains
down
the
wet
street
on
a
winter
day
when
the
rain
was
speckling
the
and
though
it
was
middle
afternoon
and
none
of
the
lamps
were
lighted
yet
the
night
had
settled
down
too
soon
and
the
sky
was
low
and
dark
and
wet
in
a
cracked
old
voice
i
heard
him
sing
strangely
capering
to
and
fro
sawing
his
fiddle
on
one
worn
string
a
grotesque
and
desolate
thing
of
woe
wagging
his
head
and
stamping
his
feet
unwitting
of
the
hurrying
through
the
gloomy
street
his
shoulders
hunched
and
his
head
awry
the
children
would
laugh
when
they
saw
him
pass
and
look
they
say
at
crazy
joe
and
press
their
faces
against
the
glass
to
watch
him
leering
and
lurching
go
where
he
comes
from
nobody
knows
but
he
being
mad
is
in
god
hand
and
sacred
upon
his
way
he
goes
and
his
music
god
will
understand
piccadilly
above
the
quiet
stars
and
the
night
wind
below
the
streets
and
up
and
down
the
tired
stealthy
steps
of
those
who
walk
when
the
just
sleep
at
night
in
london
town
poor
garish
ghosts
that
haunt
the
yellow
glare
wan
spectres
lurking
in
the
alleys
dark
among
the
tainted
while
the
wind
is
whispering
to
the
trees
across
the
park
for
it
is
summer
may
be
and
the
scent
of
hay
is
sweet
across
the
fields
but
neither
summer
nor
the
gleaming
spring
one
breath
of
healing
to
this
dark
life
yields
no
morning
sunshine
greets
these
sidelong
eyes
with
blessings
daughters
as
they
are
of
gloom
ghosts
only
such
as
seem
to
have
a
shape
at
night
in
some
old
evil
haunted
room
would
that
they
were
indeed
to
be
dissolved
at
every
sunrise
they
are
living
souls
dragging
mortality
about
foul
streets
while
overhead
the
heaven
rolls
living
souls
are
they
and
they
have
their
share
in
seed
and
harvest
and
the
round
world
boon
of
changing
seasons
and
the
miracle
of
each
month
waxing
and
waning
of
the
moon
living
souls
are
they
prisoned
in
a
net
of
stealthy
streets
age
after
age
they
gone
bearing
the
burden
of
a
city
sin
in
london
and
old
rome
and
babylon
in
the
tube
a
tired
working
woman
came
in
in
the
yellow
glare
of
electricity
an
urchin
trailed
clumsily
after
her
with
towsled
hair
and
sharp
pale
features
and
a
vacant
stare
and
in
her
arms
she
bore
another
child
a
sick
child
doubtless
where
all
three
looked
sick
the
poor
legs
hanging
limply
lean
and
blue
dangled
grotesquely
for
the
boots
too
thick
for
such
frail
bones
a
touch
could
snap
in
two
like
seemed
to
swing
as
staggered
through
the
burdened
mother
till
she
found
a
seat
through
dark
unnatural
to
unnatural
blaze
of
stations
rocked
the
train
it
tore
the
air
to
shreds
and
tatters
in
the
tunnelled
ways
with
such
a
noise
as
when
hell
trumpets
blare
we
swaying
faced
our
there
each
mercilessly
pilloried
in
light
the
sick
child
lay
against
the
woman
breast
asleep
and
she
looked
down
on
it
and
smiled
and
with
her
gaunt
arms
made
her
bird
a
nest
against
her
poor
worn
bosom
sad
and
mild
in
such
wise
looked
madonna
at
her
child
where
old
saints
worshipped
round
the
altar
set
such
glory
of
the
spirit
shone
and
streamed
in
that
brief
moment
that
her
form
and
face
were
rags
of
vesture
only
through
which
gleamed
the
splendour
something
of
wonder
and
of
grace
making
the
poor
flesh
lovely
all
the
place
grew
holy
with
the
mother
and
the
child
a
london
idyll
i
a
heavy
sky
and
a
drizzling
rain
and
the
lamps
in
rigid
rows
long
smears
of
light
all
down
the
street
where
a
lean
cat
stalking
goes
blank
save
a
glimmer
here
and
there
the
gaunt
dark
houses
stand
and
a
man
and
a
girl
against
the
gate
whispering
hand
in
hand
there
is
a
little
dripping
sound
of
rain
from
off
the
roof
and
gleaming
like
black
armour
goes
the
policeman
waterproof
he
crosses
the
road
to
give
them
room
as
he
takes
his
evening
beat
he
also
knows
that
heaven
may
look
like
a
rainy
london
street
a
london
idyll
ii
just
to
all
of
us
once
there
comes
this
splendour
and
wonder
of
love
when
the
earth
is
transmuted
to
silver
and
gold
and
heaven
opens
above
when
all
we
have
ever
seen
with
our
eyes
daily
under
the
sun
seems
like
a
miracle
happening
again
to
us
two
instead
of
to
one
when
there
is
nothing
so
ugly
or
mean
but
somehow
shimmers
and
glows
in
that
light
whose
spring
is
within
our
hearts
and
whose
stream
the
wide
earth
flows
when
the
spirit
of
us
that
is
prisoned
within
seems
at
last
to
have
wings
and
soaring
looks

other
verses
in
early

there
a
secret
have
you
guessed
it
you
with
human
eyes
and
hearing
which
the
birds
know
which
the
trees
know
and
by
which
the
earth
is
stirred
stirred
through
all
her
deep
foundations
where
the
are
fastened
where
the
seed
is
and
the
growth
is
and
the
still
blind
life
is
heard
there
a
miracle
a
miracle
oh
mortal
have
you
seen
it
when
the
springs
rise
and
the
saps
rise
and
the
gallant
of
the
bright
battalions
of
the
little
green
things
growing
or
pierce
the
brown
earth
sullen
crust
oh
wonder
beyond
speaking
in
the
daily
common
happening
but
the
little
birds
have
known
it
and
the
thrush
in
the
cold
and
pearly
twilights
that
are
february
token
speaks
of
revelation
through
the
falling
hush
a
ballad
of
the
fall
of
knossos
is
it
a
whisper
that
runs
through
the
galleries
is
it
a
rustle
that
stirs
in
the
halls
is
it
of
mortals
or
things
that
are
otherwise
this
sound
that
so
haltingly
dreadfully
falls
pauses
and
hurries
and
falls
no
moon
and
no
torches
not
even
a
glimmer
to
the
darkness
that
weighs
like
a
sin
and
nothing
is
breathing
and
nothing
is
stirring
and
hushed
are
the
small
owls
without
and
within
the
mice
to
their
holes
have
run
in
it
is
not
the
step
of
a
foot
on
the
pavement
it
is
not
the
brush
of
a
wing
through
the
air
it
is
not
a
passing
it
is
not
a
presence
but
the
ghost
of
the
fate
that
this
palace
must
bear
of
the
ruin
of
knossos
goes
there
for
on
such
a
night
when
the
moon
is
dark
and
all
of
the
stars
are
dumb
with
a
sudden
flare
by
the
gate
shall
the
doom
of
knossos
come
for
a
cry
will
shatter
the
brooding
hush
and
the
crickets
and
mice
shall
wake
to
clatter
and
clash
and
shout
and
cry
and
the
stumble
of
frenzied
feet
going
by
death
stride
will
overtake
for
into
the
glare
of
a
torch
that
shakes
in
a
shaking
grasp
and
dark
with
blood
shall
a
runner
break
and
gasp
of
a
burning
harbour
of
silent
ships
of
men
sprung
out
of
the
night
is
it
men
or
devils
he
moans
and
reels
shoulder
to
wall
and
a
red
stain
steals
down
the
frescoes
gay
and
bright
and
hard
on
the
word
they
hear
approach
the
surge
of
the
battle
near
and
to
whistle
of
arrows
and
clang
of
bronze
the
palace
awakes
in
fear
light
light
and
torches
like
waking
eyes
leap
from
each
darkened
door
and
the
guard
at
the
gate
go
down
in
the
vast
black
sea
of
men
and
drown
while
sweeps
the
torrent
what
door
shall
hold
or
what
walls
withstand
the
roll
of
a
full
with
an
wind
and
the
gates
of
bronze
ring
rock
and
are
flung
aside
and
a
myriad
unknown
raiders
burst
into
the
hall
of
the
king
where
minos
on
his
carved
stone
seat
beheld
the
nations
at
his
feet
watched
each
its
tribute
bring
minos
is
slain
his
guards
are
slain
which
of
his
sons
shall
live
in
this
pillared
hall
of
the
double
axe
the
word
of
the
kings
to
give
which
of
his
sons
shall
they
know
his
sons
in
this
sudden
terror
sprung
on
sleeping
men
they
stand
foot
pressed
to
foot
hand
tense
to
hand
and
muscles
the
flame
of
the
torches
in
the
wind
of
their
struggle
blackens
the
wall
and
the
floor
is
sticky
with
blood
and
heaped
with
the
bodies
of
those
that
fall
what
if
a
son
of
minos
live
in
that
horror
of
blood
and
gloom
what
of
the
noble
what
of
the
brave
better
to
die
than
endure
as
a
slave
the
days
after
knossos
doom
but
above
the
scuffle
of
sandalled
feet
and
the
breath
of
men
and
the
clash
of
bronze
and
the
gasp
and
thud
as
the
point
goes
through
the
breast
and
above
the
startled
hoot
of
owls
and
the
rattle
of
shield
and
spear
the
wailing
voices
of
women
rise
as
their
men
are
stricken
before
their
eyes
and
they
huddle
together
in
fear
slow
comes
the
dawning
in
the
east
pale
light
on
the
earth
is
shed
and
cool
and
dewy
blows
the
wind
over
the
writhen
dead
pale
light
which
fades
in
the
growing
glare
of
the
flames
that
swirl
and
leap
through
corridor
and
bower
and
hall
on
carven
pillar
and
painted
wall
the
flames
that
like
sickles
reap
a
barren
harvest
of
kingly
things
to
be
bound
in
ashy
sheaves
while
driven
forth
by
the
work
of
his
hands
stumbles
the
last
of
the
thieves
behind
him
is
fire
ruin
and
death
before
him
the
morn
but
vases
of
silver
and
cups
of
gold
and
hoarded
treasures
fashioned
of
old
on
his
back
are
borne
is
it
the
alone
that
blows
shuddering
down
the
dim
corridors
tangled
with
weeds
is
it
a
bat
wing
or
is
it
an
owl
wing
that
silently
passes
as
thistledown
seeds
in
the
hall
where
the
small
owlet
breeds
here
do
the
moonbeams
come
slithering
wandering
over
the
faded
pale
frescoes
that
stand
faint
and
remote
on
the
walls
that
are
mouldering
crowned
with
a
king
crown
or
flowers
in
hand
pale
ghosts
of
a
band
faintly
they
gaze
on
the
wide
desolation
faintly
they
smile
when
the
white
moonbeams
play
over
the
dust
of
the
of
minos
over
the
pavements
where
small
creatures
stray
the
humble
small
things
of
a
day
but
there
are
other
nights
moonless
and
starless
when
no
moth
flutters
no
bat
flits
owl
calls
something
is
stirring
something
is
rustling
something
that
is
not
of
mortals
befalls
in
galleries
cellars
and
halls
soundless
and
viewless
a
strange
ghostly
happening
life
long
since
ashes
and
flames
long
since
dead
for
the
angel
of
time
goes
relentlessly
steadily
over
dark
places
that
mankind
has
fled
and
the
dust
is
not
stirred
by
that
tread
a
in
a
garden
across
the
quiet
garden
sunlight
flows
in
wave
on
wave
like
water
heavy
bees
hang
drowsily
upon
the
drowsy
flowers
for
it
is
very
still
and
all
the
trees
are
pyramided
high
in
green
and
gold
there
is
a
there
to
mark
the
hours
where
time
is
not
where
time
has
grown
so
old
it
does
not
move
now
yet
the
shadow
goes
across
the
dial
that
so
warm
to
feel
like
a
cold
stealthy
creeping
living
thing
you
can
not
see
it
steal
minute
from
minute
of
the
golden
day
till
all
are
eaten
away
you
can
not
press
it
back
with
both
your
hands
and
on
the
shadowed
stone
laying
your
cheek
you
never
warmth
can
bring
to
what
beneath
the
sad
triangle
stands
solitary
in
sunlight
for
we
know
it
takes
the
whole
great
swinging
earth
to
throw
the
little
shadow
on
the
little
stone
two
only
only
two
hearts
shall
understand
the
sea
that
speaks
at
nightfall
in
the
wash
and
lap
of
windless
evenings
under
flaming
skies
only
two
hearts
shall
hear
the
rising
sap
in
wet
spring
woods
and
two
alone
grown
wise
in
union
shall
make
discovery
of
what
lies
hidden
though
before
our
eyes
oh
core
of
wonder
in
familiar
things
magic
of
evening
and
of
early
morn
but
just
created
with
the
dew
of
birth
all
fresh
upon
it
heaven
itself
the
green
splendour
of
the
quiet
earth
and
like
a
bird
that
sings
because
of
sunlight
is
the
spirit
mirth
all
forms
of
beauty
but
express
the
soul
as
in
a
the
wind
that
goes
to
the
trees
beneath
the
stars
or
the
small
sound
of
water
as
it
flows
under
old
bridges
where
the
ivy
mars
the
sharp
stone
outline
these
are
in
the
whole
of
the
small
tuneful
bars
and
human
beings
in
the
span
of
years
some
part
of
all
the
may
receive
more
less
but
never
all
and
with
dismay
we
see
slow
time
his
net
of
hours
weave
to
catch
from
us
dear
mortal
night
and
day
ere
we
have
taken
in
our
eyes
and
ears
beauty
that
lies
around
beyond
away
we
singly
feel
a
sudden
sharp
regret
behind
all
beauty
but
we
two
in
one
as
white
and
blue
are
separate
in
a
flame
yet
mingled
we
shall
watch
the
hours
run
seeing
with
surer
knowledge
how
the
same
eternal
splendour
for
the
soul
is
set
and
the
day
comes
again
from
whence
day
came
the
saint
birthday
one
of
god
blessed
pitying
saints
one
day
reaching
out
hands
to
touch
the
azure
throne
because
it
is
my
birthday
lord
he
said
that
i
was
born
in
heaven
when
i
was
known
by
an
earthly
name
and
stoned
and
left
for
dead
because
it
is
the
custom
lord
of
men
to
keep
their
birthdays
gladly
and
with
gifts
grant
me
a
blessing
from
your
blesséd
stores
and
from
the
cloudy
rose
and
amber
drifts
about
the
throne
god
answered
it
is
yours
then
sprang
the
glad
saint
earthwards
at
his
feet
were
little
golden
flames
and
all
his
hair
was
blown
about
his
head
like
tongues
of
fire
and
like
a
star
he
burned
through
the
dark
air
and
came
and
stood
by
farm
and
shed
and
byre
before
the
earliest
grey
was
in
the
east
or
the
first
smoke
above
the
from
housewife
yet
the
cheep
and
twitter
of
birds
did
gladly
welcome
back
him
who
such
love
for
earth
in
heaven
could
keep
and
who
on
earth
such
love
had
had
for
men
and
bird
and
beast
and
all
that
lived
and
grew
the
sparrows
in
the
eaves
remembered
him
and
chirrupped
in
the
gables
while
the
dew
was
dark
still
and
the
day
below
the
rim
he
stood
there
in
the
village
of
his
life
ere
he
won
heaven
and
the
breath
of
cows
came
as
a
benediction
and
the
smell
of
copses
and
where
cattle
browse
long
grass
and
running
water
in
the
dell
and
his
heart
opened
with
the
love
he
had
for
the
dear
of
men
to
hear
the
sheep
crop
see
the
glimmering
grey
lighten
the
waiting
windows
once
again
and
garden
roses
opening
to
the
day
not
otherwise
was
eden
once
he
thought
and
by
god
blessing
it
may
be
anew
and
so
put
forth
the
power
god
had
lent
and
took
away
all
labour
and
he
drew
heaven
to
earth
till
earth
and
heaven
were
blent
time
ceased
to
be
and
yet
the
sun
and
shade
shifted
to
make
new
beauty
with
the
hours
and
the
ripe
earth
unlaboured
gave
her
yields
no
pain
there
was
no
age
and
all
the
flowers
unwitheringly
lovely
filled
the
fields
and
all
day
long
the
birds
in
ecstasy
sang
without
shadow
of
hawk
or
thought
of
death
and
the
saint
happily
went
about
the
ways
filling
each
home
with
plenty
his
very
breath
was
like
a
little
thrilling
note
of
praise
when
all
was
done
he
stepped
back
to
see
and
love
his
handiwork
and
then
came
a
sharp
pain
and
pierced
him
through
and
through
he
had
wrought
lovingly
for
the
days
of
men
but
the
heart
of
men
his
love
could
not
renew
the
weary
heart
the
the
loving
lacking
lonely
incomplete
for
ever
longing
to
be
merged
in
one
with
something
other
than
itself
to
beat
to
another
pulse
to
be
for
ever
done
with
its
sad
weight
of
personality
then
god
leaned
down
to
his
poor
saint
and
said
dear
soul
would
you
make
heaven
upon
the
earth
nor
know
indeed
my
purpose
in
all
birth
nor
that
my
blessing
is
upon
the
dead
rupert
brooke
you
that
are
gone
into
the
dark
of
unknowing
and
unbeing
you
that
have
heard
the
song
of
the
lark
you
that
have
seen
the
joy
of
the
spring
you
have
i
seen
you
have
i
known
the
word
you
have
written
your
pictured
head
and
they
say
you
are
laid
at
lemnos
among
the
english
dead
soul
that
is
gone
is
gone
whether
into
the
dark
or
into
knowledge
complete
and
the
blinding
light
soul
that
was
swift
and
free
passionate
eager
bright
armed
with
a
weapon
for
shams
and
set
with
wings
for
flight
soul
that
was
questioning
restless
and
all
at
odds
with
life
greedy
for
it
yet
satiate
and
sick
with
the
shows
of
things
and
all
laid
down
at
lemnos
the
hunger
the
love
the
strife
and
the
youthful
grace
of
body
and
the
body
ministerings
darkness
darkness
or
light
you
have
leapt
from
the
circle
of
sense
and
only
your
dust
remains
and
the
word
you
said
if
i
should
die
and
we
name
you
among
the
dead
yet
have
i
a
hope
at
heart
that
somewhere
away
apart
knowledge
is
yours
and
joy
of
the
act
fulfilled
to
still
your
fever
of
soul
as
your
fever
of
blood
is
stilled
so
shall
you
soar
and
run
in
water
and
wind
and
air
with
your
old
clean
joy
of
the
sun
and
your
gladness
in
all
things
fair
untouched
by
mortality
sadness
simple
perfect
at
one
comfort
me
with
apples
for
i
am
sick
of
love
red
lilies
under
the
sun
red
apples
hanging
above
and
red
is
the
wine
that
is
spilled
on
your
bare
white
feet
o
love
the
poppies
sullenly
glow
in
the
smouldering
red
from
the
west
and
black
are
the
dregs
of
the
wine
o
love
on
your
bare
white
breast
aie
aie
when
the
wild
swan
flies
lonely
and
dark
is
the
place
that
the
white
wings
lightened
and
death
will
cover
your
glowing
face
o
thief
that
is
night
o
thieves
cold
years
that
devour
us
all
the
lilies
blossom
and
wilt
the
apples
ripen
and
fall
the
apples
the
apples
of
love
lo
where
we
have
spilled
the
wine
this
quenchless
earth
is
agape
o
love
for
your
body
and
mine
of
england
white
is
for
purity
blue
for
heaven
grace
purple
is
for
emperors
sitting
in
their
place
yellow
is
for
happiness
rose
for
love
embrace
but
green
oh
green
the
green
of
england
that
for
paradise
from
seashore
to
seashore
races
the
green
tide
with
the
pricking
green
of
hedges
by
the
wet
roadside
or
ever
march
triumphant
comes
with
great
glad
stride
there
is
green
there
green
in
england
and
a
tale
of
paradise
then
the
hawthorns
flush
and
tremble
in
their
early
wondrous
green
and
the
willows
are
resplendent
in
a
sheen
like
the
golden
tents
of
princes
babylonish
damascene
or
enchanted
silent
fountains
of
a
persian
paradise
there
are
beech
and
birch
and
or
and
the
splendid
generous
chestnuts
with
their
blooms
embossed
there
are
oak
and
ash
and
elder
till
the
very
sun
is
lost
in
the
green
delicious
gloaming
that
the
light
of
paradise
deeper
wider
steadier
this
beauty
ever
grows
and
from
up
to
the
endless
colour
flows
till
road
and
house
and
wayside
in
the
first
days
of
the
rose
are
fathoms
deep
in
waves
of
green
submerged
in
paradise
oh
dim
and
lovely
hollows
of
all
the
woods
that
be
oh
sunlight
on
the
uplands
like
a
calm
great
sea
i
think
indeed
the
souls
of
those
from
circumstance
set

look

look
down
on
england
saying
ah
dear
paradise
question
what
of
this
gift
of
life
passionate
swift
and
rife
with
pleasure
or
pain
in
the
hand
of
the
hurrying
hours
oh
little
moment
of
space
oh
death
averted
face
how
shall
we
grasp
shall
we
grasp
what
still
is
ours
chill
chill
on
either
hand
eternities
must
stand
and
pants
between
them
passionate
and
brief
the
moment
self
to
make
or
unmake
but
to
take
just
here
just
now
before
death
turns
the
leaf
ah
if
the
leaf
but
turn
and
if
the
soul
discern
another
message
on
another
page
but
if
death
shuts
the
book
we
may
not
know
nor
look
we
are
fenced
in
upon
a
narrow
stage
while
splendid
and
intense
in
every
sense
life
burns
in
us
and
earth
lies
all
around
far
blue
of
summer
seas
young
green
of
trees
bound
by
the
season
by
the
horizon
bound
oh
colour
sound
and
light
oh
wondrous
day
and
night
pale
dawns
and
evenings
splendid
stretch
of
gold
keen
beauty
like
a
spear
half
pleasure
and
half
fear
goes
through
us
for
the
things
we
may
not
hold
hot
blood
hot
noons
hot
youth
when
life
seems
all
the
truth
and
death
a
mumbled
far
old
when
just
the
splendid
days
suffice
our
eager
gaze
the
wondrous
present
that
will
never
fail
then
one
day
with
a
fierce
clamour
of
heart
we
pierce
the
light
and
see
the
shadows
all
behind
and
then
and
not
till
then
by
the
brief
graves
of
men
the
utter
loveliness
of
flowers
we
find
so
little
stretch
of
days
and
earth
with
all
her
ways
lovely
enough
i
think
for
paradise
and
body
mind
and
heart
each
separate
complex
part
wondrously
made
and
never
quite
made
twice
what
of
this
gift
of
life
shall
it
be
worn
in
strife
shall
it
be
idly
spent
or
idly
stored
each
for
himself
must
dare
if
the
answer
is
here
or
there
here
for
regret
or
there
for
hope
o
lord
leonardo
to
monna
lisa
i
wish
you
were
a
beaker
of
venetian
glass
that
i
might
fill
you
with
most
precious
wine
and
drink
it
breathless
lo
the
moments
pass
of
that
subliminal
communion
i
take
you
from
my
lips
and
crush
you
so
into
a
thousand
shining
particles
so
at
the
last
my
passionate
greed
shall
know
that
you
were
wholly
mine
i
wish
you
were
a
rare
stringed
instrument
beneath
my
hand
and
from
you
i
would
wring
such
unimagined
music
as
was
sent
never
before
along
the
quivering
nerves
such
strange
sharp
discords
out
of
which
i
mould
music
more
sweet
than
the
spring
nightingale
then
ere
the
magic
of
the
sound
was
old
would
i
not
rend
each
string
possess
you
ah
not
with
the
world
possession
you
still
strange
creature
neither
force
nor
will
could
make
you
serve
a
man
mere
earthly
passion
i
would
dissolve
you
in
one
blinding
flash
into
a
drop
of
elemental
dew
and
let
you
trickle
down
the
barren
rock
into
the
black
abyss
if
so
i
knew
that
you
henceforth
were
powerless
to
mock
my
spirit
with
your
smile
the
eternal
flux
let
us
hold
april
back
one
splendid
hour
to
bless
the
passionate
earth
with
golden
shower
of
sunlight
from
the
blue
oh
april
skies
that
earth
yearns
up
to
blue
has
burned
to
gold
gold
pales
and
dies
in
delicate
faint
rose
oh
flowing
time
oh
flux
eternal
hold
the
hour
back
the
april
hour
goes
then
let
it
be
of
may
when
sound
and
sight
and
all
that
beauty
manifest
through
all
the
day
of
deep
on
deep
with
green
of
light
on
light
across
the
waves
of
blossom
when
the
white
is
lovelier
than
the
rose
except
the
rose
is
loveliest
of
all
when
through
the
day
the
cuckoo
calls
unseen
and
at
nightfall
the
nightingale
whose
music
no
man
knows
the
magic
heart
of
sitting
in
the
dark
sings
still
the
way
when
all
of
these
flowers
and
birds
and
sunset
and
pale
skies
seem
gathered
up
in
scent
and
all
of
sound
and
sight
dissolved
ethereal
not
of
ears
and
eyes
but
only
the
of
the
brain
flows
in
such
waves
of
perfume
over
all
or
like
a
song
in
colour
of
such
strain
as
spirits
finer
than
our
own
must
hear
the
beautiful
made
clear
then
then
when
it
is
may
surely
our
hand
must
touch
eternity
day
pales
to
night
stars
pale
upon
the
day
and
may
last
blossoming
hour
flows
away
not
of
june
either
though
the
hanging
skies
make
but
a
little
span
light
and
growing
light
and
when
through
that
short
darkness
palely
flies
the
silent
great
white
moth
a
spirit
lost
in
the
night
a
soul
without
will
or
way
when
the
arch
of
trees
is
duskily
green
and
close
as
a
builded
house
where
love
with
love
might
stay
guarded
and
still
from
sight
when
the
hay
is
sweet
in
the
fields
and
love
is
as
sweet
as
hay
when
the
of
the
wonderful
untamed
earth
has
reached
its
fulness
and
height
is
broad
and
steady
and
wide
as
sweeps
into
splendid
bays
the
flowing
tide
when
god
might
look
on
the
land
when
god
might
look
on
the
sea
and
say
for
ever
be
perfect
completed
achieved
as
now
at
this
moment
you
stand
neither
in
june
shall
we
stay
the
eternal
flow
nor
grasp
the
present
with
pitiful
mortal
hand
for
sliding
past
like
water
the
june
hours
go
love
is
the
ultimate
measure
of
the
soul
love
is
the
ultimate
measure
of
the
soul
love
is
the
biting
acid
the
sure
test
to
strip
the
naked
gold
discard
the
rest
of
earthly
stuffs
love
is
the
one
thing
whole
in
a
world
of
broken
parts
for
love
is
all
love
is
creation
love
is
the
low
call
of
deep
to
deep
love
is
the
force
that
shapes
the
thing
that
it
believes
and
while
there
gapes
the
black
where
the
poor
flesh
must
fall
love
builds
on
hope
and
buds
eternal
life
love
is
a
victory
unsoiled
by
strife
who
is
there
that
shall
adequately
name
all
that
love
is
this
thing
as
swift
as
flame
and
vast
as
heaven
yet
in
every
life
tamed
to
the
narrow
needs
of
little
men
from
humble
love
that
makes
the
partridge
hen
brave
for
her
chickens
to
the
love
that
shakes
the
world
from
calvary
all
love
partakes
of
immortality
one
can
not
pen
divinity
in
words
love
is
divine
the
very
essence
of
god
does
love
enshrine
for
let
the
heart
however
sorely
tried
open
itself
to
loving
and
the
wide
earth
is
a
home
must
decline
where
black
fears
crowd
across
the
starless
dark
for
love
is
light
the
faith
that
will
embark
unpiloted
upon
uncharted
seas
is
love
alone
the
fiery
leap
to
seize
the
splendid
distant
aim
the
invisible
mark
what
else
but
love
love
is
the
thing
that
stands
unchanged
on
changing
tides
and
shifting
sands
november
the
little
summer
of
all
saints
the
year
stands
still
the
tearing
winter
winds
hold
off
their
claws
a
moment
that
the
trees
may
keep
the
glory
of
their
blended
gold
a
little
minute
there
not
so
much
breeze
as
summer
mornings
hold
golden
and
still
the
hours
russet
gold
the
the
silver
of
the
bark
pale
gold
the
poplars
like
a
lady
hair
and
thunderous
gold
along
the
hollows
dark
the
sunlit
brackens
flare
the
lovers
there
are
ghosts
we
walk
with
lady
of
mine
arm
in
arm
and
side
by
side
pallid
ghosts
though
the
sun
may
shine
ghosts
that
are
cold
in
the
warmth
of
day
and
neither
of
us
may
fend
them
away
but
step
by
step
they
go
with
us
stride
by
stride
there
are
doors
in
your
heart
that
are
shut
to
me
and
behind
them
dwellers
i
can
not
know
and
my
soul
has
windows
that
open
wide
on
a
ghostly
memoried
that
lady
of
mine
you
never
will
see
where
your
voice
will
never
be
heard
nor
your
footsteps
go
so
we
walk
together
hand
in
hand
while
dark
eyes
peer
at
us
pale
forms
come
and
speak
in
my
ear
or
call
your
name
with
a
voice
i
hear
not
for
praise
or
blame
and
you
walk
alone
with
that
ghostly
band
while
i
go
by
the
side
of
you
pitying
powerless
dumb
the
gentle
heart
what
shall
harm
the
gentle
heart
in
its
purpose
undefiled
even
grief
shall
lose
its
smart
in
some
way
becoming
part
of
that
nature
soothed
and
gentled
as
a
sorrow
to
a
child
through
the
blackness
and
the
sin
of
the
old
world
wrongs
and
woes
and
through
the
greater
dark
within
the
gentle
heart
shall
surely
win
as
some
bright
angel
armed
with
mercy
swiftly
on
his
errand
goes
all
the
body
may
have
wrought
all
the
energies
of
mind
that
for
its
own
purpose
sought
make
at
length
a
little
nought
among
the
stars
the
gentle
heart
death
itself
will
leave
behind
a
ballad
for
herman
this
is
the
ballad
for
herman
the
ballad
of
humble
things
the
thistles
that
flower
the
small
brown
lark
that
sings
and
the
stumbling
flight
of
a
beetle
and
the
dust
on
a
butterfly
wings
the
snails
are
out
in
the
sunshine
after
the
morning
rain
and
the
wasps
are
whirring
and
buzzing
round
the
mulberry
tree
again
and
the
ants
are
busy
of
course
working
with
might
and
main
while
the
crickets
leap
and
rustle
and
play
at
being
blades
of
grass
and
the
bees
go
lurching
as
they
pass
and
the
flies
are
stupidly
walking
up
the
the
sun
is
bright
on
the
hedges
on
thistle
and
bramble
and
briar
the
columbine
leaves
are
and
shine
as
bright
as
fire
and
oh
the
smell
of
the
bracken
that
straight
as
salisbury
spire
life
of
the
woods
life
of
the
rivers
life
of
the
trees
life
of
the
rich
that
seed
to
the
morning
breeze
and
the
thymy
june
makes
loud
with
bees
this
does
not
age
nor
alter
the
low
sharp
song
of
the
reeds
as
the
evening
wind
goes
over
and
the
fishing
heron
feeds
on
the
still
and
shallow
waters
salt
with
the
floating
weeds
this
does
not
change
nor
vanish
the
mating
calls
of
the
springs
when
april
green
on
the
copses
and
bright
on
the
shining
wings
of
birds
going
backwards
and
forwards
while
the
whole
green
forest
sings
all
is
our
sister
and
brother
as
once
francis
said
the
little
stones
in
the
river
the
bright
sun
overhead
and
newts
and
the
spawn
of
fishes
and
the
unnamed
mighty
dead
this
is
the
ballad
for
herman
o
friend
may
good
befall
there
is
never
a
star
so
distant
there
is
never
a
creature
small
but
living
and
knowing
and
loving
in
our
brain
we
hold
them
all
france
great
ever
with
the
hope
that
seeks
the
stars
the
brain
like
ice
the
soul
like
flame
the
spirit
beating
at
the
physical
bars
the
reason
guiding
all
oh
there
we
name
france
a
country
that
can
think
and
thinking
acts
a
country
that
can
act
and
acting
dreams
that
neither
bears
the
tyranny
of
facts
nor
of
its
own
dear
hopes
nor
of
what
seems
but
still
treats
with
things
that
are
yet
seer
prophet
priest
of
leaps
to
the
visionary
days
afar
and
all
the
splendour
she
will
never
see
school
of
the
spirit
chastening
yet
a
spur
for
all
that
men
aspire
to
as
of
old
athens
held
up
the
torch
and
did
incur
persia
with
her
fierce
armies
manifold
so
france
against
the
evil
strikes
and
strives
for
liberty
and
we
of
island
race
humbled
a
little
by
our
careless
lives
glory
to
stand
beside
her
in
our
place
glory
that
we
are
one
in
hope
and
aim
with
her
from
whom
in
blood
and
agony
the
second
gift
of
human
freedom
came
through
terror
and
the
red
gethsemane
on
her
fair
ravaged
borders
stand
her
guns
she
has
thrown
away
the
scabbards
bared
the
swords
and
snatching
laughter
out
of
death
her
sons
challenge
high
fate
to
show
what
life
affords
france
ilgar
song
from
o
love
that
dwells
in
the
innermost
heart
of
man
secret
and
dark
and
still
like
a
bird
in
the
core
of
a
green
tree
height
upon
height
and
depth
upon
depth
where
never
the
eye
can
see
the
brown
bird
hidden
and
still
o
love
that
is
wild
and
eager
and
free
like
a
seagull
that
turns
in
the
sunlight
above
the
sea
between
the
sea
and
the
sky
it
flashes
and
turns
and
the
sun
on
its
wings
is
white
while
sharply
and
shrill
by
the
headland
the
keen
wind
sings
where
the
grass
is
salt
and
grey
with
the
beating
winter
spray
and
the
seagull
sweeps
and
soars
on
magnificent
wings
love
that
is
like
a
flame
held
in
the
hollow
hand
so
dear
and
precious
a
thing
as
a
light
in
a
stranger
land
as
a
flickering
candle
to
him
who
wanders
by
night
love
that
is
wide
as
the
dawn
to
the
eyes
of
men
and
the
evil
ghosts
and
the
goblins
it
puts
to
flight
and
stealthy
creatures
of
dark
that
rustle
and
creep
and
elfins
and
witches
and
all
such
devil
game
that
can
not
live
in
the
light
they
squeak
and
gibber
and
cheep
and
vanish
like
shadows
before
the
splendour
of
day
love
that
has
wide
white
wings
like
a
flying
swan
oh
what
a
noble
span
from
tip
to
tip
they
are
more
than
the
height
of
a
man
and
curved
like
the
sails
of
a
boat
when
over
the
evening
river
the
wild
swan
flies
the
curve
of
those
wings
is
like
the
arch
of
the
skies
over
the
shielded
earth
love
is
most
like
a
bird
for
birds
have
least
of
the
dust
that
gave
them
birth
they
soar
and
poise
and
float
they
wheel
and
swerve
and
skim
and
their
wings
are
strong
to
the
wind
and
swift
to
the
light
and
their
voice
is
a
promise
of
dawn
while
yet
it
is
night
and
their
song
is
a
pæan
of
hope
before
it
is
spring
and
the
song
of
the
bird
to
his
mate
is
lyrical
love
love
is
secret
and
holy
a
spiritual
thing
dark
and
silent
and
still
in
the
heart
of
man
as
a
treasure
is
hid
in
a
shrine
love
is
splendid
and
fierce
as
the
summer
sun
drenches
the
sea
and
the
sky
with
its
blaze
and
shine
till
every
pebble
is
hot
to
the
touch
of
the
hand
and
the
air
is
with
heat
the
hazy
land
yet
love
is
not
any
of
these
things
love
is
of
one
with
the
strange
at
vast
creative
plan
we
can
not
see
with
our
eyes
nor
understand
yet
is
love
pitiful
too
for
love
is
of
man
the
inn
i
friendship
an
inn
the
roads
of
life
afford
i
speak
to
you
in
metaphor
my
friend
and
there
a
tired
man
his
way
may
wend
and
coming
in
sit
down
beside
the
board
out
of
the
dust
and
glare
and
boldly
send
for
drink
and
victuals
haply
cross
his
knees
and
in
the
cool
dark
parlour
take
his
ease
and
gossip
of
his
journey
and
its
end
that
friendship
there
is
neither
right
of
place
nor
landlord
duties
just
the
short
hour
stay
from
the
sun
and
weariness
between
those
kind
and
quiet
walls
and
when
the
road
to
face
stony
and
long
again
we
take
our
way
keeping
that
respite
gratefully
in
mind
the
inn
ii
we
take
our
pack
and
jog
our
way
again
towards
the
windy
sunset
and
the
night
the
inn
is
now
behind
us
out
of
sight
showing
no
welcome
shine
of
windowpane
but
dark
and
silent
standing
by
the
way
as
we
go
forward
seeing
mile
on
mile
sink
out
of
sight
just
for
a
little
while
we
rested
in
the
middle
of
the
day
is
there
an
end
at
last
and
shall
we
reach
by
the
faint
glimmer
of
stars
our
house
at
last
and
find
the
which
is
the
ultimate
desire
of
each
poor
traveller
ah
shall
they
drop
the
bars
and
the
doors
open
dear
my
friend
who
knows
i
miss
you
i
miss
you
only
for
some
little
matter
of
hours
and
nothing
more
that
at
least
the
folk
say
who
never
waited
for
the
opening
door
the
greeting
look
the
known
step
on
the
floor
who
never
missed
a
loved
one
like
a
lover
i
miss
you
what
brings
is
the
other
side
of
all
the
stars
god
knows
only
to
have
you
here
now
evening
swings
its
quiet
shadow
round
the
globe
again
and
in
our
talk
of
old
familiar
things
and
in
familiar
gestures
turn
of
brain
looks
tone
of
voice
i
may
discern
again
that
union
from
which
alone
love
grows
we
close
the
curtains
while
the
world
outside
noisily
autumn
makes
a
sense
of
peace
deeper
within
open
the
bookcase
wide
and
take
a
book
out
then
another
book
and
then
another
here
a
favourite
look
we
can
not
pass
him
then
from
reading
cease
gossip
and
laugh
with
finger
in
the
page
and
challenge
thought
with
thought
and
mind
with
mind
each
speaking
freely
that
we
might
increase
some
knowledge
to
which
singly
we
were
blind
so
goes
the
evening
side
by
side
we
stand
dear
friends
and
brothers
till
a
sudden
pause
or
kindly
almost
careless
touch
of
hands
swings
us
to
face
each
other
and
we
feel
those
deepest
stirrings
of
the
human
heart
man
has
no
name
for
yet
those
changeless
laws
of
more
than
mating
that
eternal
part
our
body
is
aware
of
and
our
brain
unchallenging
with
reason
must
receive
that
sense
of
intimate
wonder
now
again
the
blinds
are
drawn
lamp
books
chairs
all
retain
familiar
aspects
but
you
absent
leave
the
room
all
empty
empty
all
the
day
how
small
the
thread
that
holds
up
happiness
how
small
the
thread
that
holds
up
happiness
but
one
frail
life
between
the
dark
and
me
your
life
dear
love
and
here
i
seem
to
see
you
whimsically
smile
that
i
confess
the
whole
round
world
with
its
vast
energy
its
summers
and
its
sunshine
and
its
aims
its
splendid
hopes
the
faith
that
unquenched
flames
all
sunk
into
the
compass
of
you
and
me
yes
you
are
right
the
single
leaves
that
fall
mar
not
the
summer
do
i
think
one
leaf
denudes
a
forest
we
are
nought
at
all
yet
the
bereaved
small
bird
within
the
tree
may
break
its
heart
above
its
nest
for
grief
and
perhaps
this
must
happen
love
to
me
in
all
things
gracious
there
is
a
thought
of
you
in
all
things
gracious
there
is
a
thought
of
you
in
the
soft
fall
of
april
rain
the
blue
of
april
skies
in
the
morning
the
full
moon
of
windless
august
nights
perfect
and
still
when
the
white
moonlight
lies
across
the
hill
of
stubble
where
a
little
mist
flickering
rises
in
the
song
of
birds
my
heart
turns
to
you
emptied
all
of
words
by
loveliness
and
in
the
poise
and
swing
of
flowering
grasses
and
in
the
lingering
grave
spacious
fall
of
evening
on
the
earth
when
the
wide
liquid
spaces
of
the
sky
above
the
dewy
fields
and
darkening
lanes
and
windless
water
lying
quietly
yield
up
the
daylight
until
none
remains
i
could
endure
or
so
it
seems
to
me
without
your
presence
a
life
of
winter
days
stark
grey
novembers
stretching
endlessly
where
i
forgetting
laughter
and
bright
things
might
set
my
face
to
duty
but
the
stir
the
loveliness
the
poignancy
of
springs
the
growth
the
rise
the
universal
press
up
to
sensation
ah
i
could
not
bear
to
live
an
april
through
but
must
take
wings
out
of
a
world
too
fair
for
loneliness
there
duty
friend
to
jog
with
arm
in
arm
there
duty
friend
to
jog
with
arm
in
arm
through
these
dark
streets
there
kindliness
indeed
and
there
the
hope
a
little
more
to
weed
our
own
small
patch
of
life
which
the
tares
harm
there
patience
for
the
folly
of
the
earth
there
pity
for
the
poor
who
suffer
wrong
there
honour
for
the
striving
and
the
strong
but
ah
dear
friend
of
mine
where
is
the
mirth
where
the
old
jollity
of
everyday
that
makes
a
holiday
of
common
things
because
they
all
are
shared
by
us
aright
the
trivial
daily
work
and
happenings
having
a
sort
of
fervour
and
delight
and
the
sun
rising
even
a
different
way
evening
beloved
of
my
soul
the
day
is
done
the
busy
noises
cease
the
lights
are
low
gently
the
doors
shut
to
behind
each
one
seeking
his
sleep
the
fading
embers
glow
on
silent
hearths
the
silent
ashes
fall
ah
absent
spirit
do
you
hear
me
call
me
sitting
waiting
by
the
fireside
this
is
the
hour
of
all
the
night
and
day
this
is
the
hour
when
work
put
aside
and
all
the
talking
whether
grave
or
gay
for
pleasure
or
for
profit
hushed
and
dumb
we
used
to
in
the
days
before
you
died
seek
out
each
other
mind
for
rest
and
say
now
am
i
home
and
all
is
well
with
me
is
gone
is
to
come
here
let
us
be
surely
for
all
the
barriers
of
sense
and
the
stark
grossness
of
this
flesh
i
wear
for
all
the
vacant
distance
of
the
skies
between
me
here
alone
and
you
gone
hence
there
must
be
some
quick
knowledge
i
must
hear
that
dear
familiar
voice
again
must
see
some
semblance
of
you
with
my
bodily
eyes
now
now
when
in
the
solitude
i
yearn
towards
your
heart
my
home
now
when
i
turn
humbly
and
searchingly
towards
that
goal
that
lies
beyond
the
purchase
of
the
world
you
again
you
dear
comrade
of
my
soul
finis
life
in
its
unimaginable
heights
when
we
may
seize
and
apprehend
the
true
soul
essence
of
one
nature
with
the
stars
rare
moments
when
our
senses
are
a
mist
that
the
truth
shines
through
oh
most
strange
and
rare
such
ecstasies
as
unimprisoned
souls
experience
in
that
thin
empyrean
beyond
the
gross
world
this
we
two
have
known
we
two
together
there
are
memories
of
such
high
happiness
in
a
fence
of
pain
as
martyrs
in
their
fiery
heart
of
death
have
blessed
their
god
for
passion
and
holiness
when
all
the
body
sinew
bone
and
brain
are
like
a
harp
from
which
the
spirit
makes
marvels
of
harmony
some
sense
too
rare
to
be
called
happiness
not
to
be
named
indeed
in
human
speech
this
we
have
touched
and
known
together
at
some
thrilling
edge
of
time
i
fall
away
from
it
the
barriers
close
about
me
i
descend
from
the
clear
heights
into
the
plains
and
valleys
of
the
world
the
traffic
of
the
is
mine
the
heat
and
dust
the
jostling
and
the
noise
the
kindly
challenge
and
the
all
these
may
claim
me
so
that
i
forget
to
lift
my
eyes
and
see
the
peaks
and
the
eternal
splendour
of
the
stars
so
be
it
let
the
tide
of
men
affairs
carry
me
back
and
forward
let
the
rub
of
greasy
passed
from
hand
to
hand
in
humble
traffic
of
a
bunch
of
herbs
not
pass
me
by
let
me
jog
arm
in
arm
or
cheek
by
jowl
the
shady
side
o
the
street
with
friends
and
neighbours
glad
to
know
them
there
imperfect
human
kind
and
tolerant
so
may
the
years
go
yet
when
the
call
comes
and
the
world
colours
fade
before
the
eye
that
turns
for
spiritual
vision
on
itself
when
from
the
four
walls
of
the
silent
room
the
noises
of
the
world
fall
back
and
fail
in
that
great
silence
which
enrings
the
last
ecstatic
moment
of
experience
here
on
this
earth
ah
then
indeed
i
know
that
i
shall
find
you
all
that
lies
behind
the
years
of
trivial
experience
shall
open
and
fall
back
from
off
my
soul
as
falls
the
brown
sheaf
from
the
opening
bud
and
in
that
poignant
moment
that
mere
breath
of
temporal
time
that
aeon
of
the
soul
i
shall
reach
out
and
know
you
mix
with
you
as
flame
with
flame
as
ray
with
ray
of
light
be
perfectly
yourself
as
you
are
me
with
all
else
fallen
gone
dispersed
away
save
the
pure
drop
of
spiritual
essence
then
let
come
what
may
light
or
oblivion
