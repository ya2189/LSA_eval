introduction
the
life
of
browning
robert
browning
the
poet
was
the
third
of
that
name
the
first
robert
browning
a
man
of
energy
and
ability
held
an
important
post
in
the
bank
of
england
his
wife
margaret
tittle
was
a
creole
from
the
west
indies
and
at
the
time
of
her
marriage
her
property
was
still
in
the
estates
owned
by
her
father
near
kitts
when
their
son
the
second
robert
was
seven
years
of
age
his
mother
died
and
his
father
afterwards
married
again
the
second
wife
ascendency
over
her
husband
was
unfortunately
exerted
against
the
best
interests
of
the
son
his
desire
to
become
an
artist
his
wish
for
a
university
training
were
disregarded
and
he
was
sent
instead
to
kitts
where
he
was
given
employment
on
his
mother
sugar
plantations
the
breach
between
robert
and
his
father
became
absolute
when
the
boy
defied
local
prejudice
by
teaching
a
negro
to
read
and
when
because
of
what
his
father
considered
a
sentimental
objection
to
slavery
he
finally
refused
to
remain
in
the
west
indies
the
young
man
returned
to
england
and
at
started
on
an
independent
career
as
a
clerk
in
the
bank
of
england
in
he
married
sarah
anne
wiedemann
they
settled
in
camberwell
london
where
robert
the
poet
was
born
may
and
his
sister
sarianna
in
browning
father
was
a
competent
official
in
the
bank
and
a
successful
business
man
but
his
tastes
were
æsthetic
and
literary
and
his
leisure
time
was
accordingly
devoted
to
such
pursuits
as
the
collection
of
old
books
and
manuscripts
he
also
read
widely
in
both
classic
and
modern
literatures
the
first
book
of
the
he
knew
by
heart
and
all
the
of
horace
and
he
was
accustomed
to
soothe
his
child
to
sleep
by
humming
to
him
snatches
of
anacreon
to
the
tune
of
a
cottage
in
the
wood
browning
had
also
considerable
skill
in
two
realms
of
art
for
he
drew
vigorous
portraits
and
caricatures
and
he
had
even
according
to
his
son
mature
judgment
extraordinary
force
and
facility
in
in
character
he
was
serene
lovable
gentle
tenderhearted
to
a
fault
so
instinctively
chivalrous
was
he
that
there
was
no
service
which
the
ugliest
oldest
crossest
woman
in
the
world
might
not
have
exacted
of
him
he
was
a
man
of
great
physical
vigor
dying
at
the
age
of
without
ever
having
been
browning
mother
was
the
daughter
of
william
wiedemann
a
german
who
had
settled
in
dundee
and
married
a
scotch
wife
browning
impressed
all
who
knew
her
by
her
sweetness
and
goodness
carlyle
spoke
of
her
as
the
true
type
of
a
scottish
gentlewoman
her
son
friend
kenyon
said
that
such
as
she
had
no
need
to
go
to
heaven
because
they
made
it
wherever
they
were
and
her
son
called
her
a
divine
woman
she
had
deep
religious
instincts
and
concerned
herself
particularly
with
her
son
moral
and
spiritual
development
the
bond
between
them
was
always
very
strong
and
when
she
died
in
his
wife
wrote
he
has
loved
his
mother
as
such
passionate
natures
can
love
and
i
never
saw
a
man
so
bowed
down
in
an
extremity
of
sorrow
never
robert
browning
childhood
was
passed
in
an
unusually
serene
and
happy
home
in
he
tells
how
at
five
years
of
age
he
was
made
to
understand
the
main
facts
of
the
trojan
war
by
his
father
clever
use
of
the
cat
the
dogs
the
pony
in
the
stable
and
the
to
impersonate
the
heroes
of
that
ancient
conflict
latin
declensions
were
taught
the
child
by
rhymes
concocted
by
his
father
as
devices
stories
and
even
lessons
were
made
intelligible
and
vivid
by
colored
maps
and
comic
drawings
until
the
boy
was
fourteen
his
schooling
was
of
the
most
casual
sort
his
only
formal
training
being
such
as
he
received
in
the
comparatively
unimportant
three
or
four
years
he
spent
after
he
was
ten
at
ready
private
school
his
real
education
came
through
all
his
early
life
from
his
home
what
would
now
be
called
he
pursued
ardently
and
on
his
own
initiative
in
the
home
garden
and
neighboring
fields
his
love
for
animals
was
inherited
from
his
mother
and
fostered
by
her
he
used
to
keep
says
orr
in
her
account
of
his
life
owls
and
monkeys
magpies
and
an
eagle
and
even
a
couple
of
large
snakes
constantly
bringing
home
the
more
portable
animals
in
his
pockets
and
transferring
them
to
his
mother
for
immediate
care
browning
says
that
his
faculty
of
observation
at
this
time
would
not
have
disgraced
a
seminole
indian
in
the
matter
of
reading
he
was
not
entirely
without
advice
and
guidance
but
was
on
the
whole
allowed
unusual
freedom
of
choice
he
afterwards
told
orr
that
milton
quarles
voltaire
mandeville
and
horace
walpole
were
the
authors
in
whom
as
a
boy
he
particularly
delighted
his
love
for
art
was
established
and
developed
by
visits
to
the
dulwich
picture
gallery
of
which
he
afterwards
wrote
to
miss
barrett
with
love
and
gratitude
because
he
had
been
allowed
to
go
there
before
the
age
prescribed
by
the
rules
and
had
thus
learned
to
know
a
wonderful
rembrandt
a
watteau
three
triumphant
murillos
a
giorgione
music
lesson
and
various
poussins
his
marked
early
susceptibility
to
music
is
evidenced
by
an
incident
narrated
by
sharp
one
afternoon
his
mother
was
playing
in
the
twilight
to
herself
she
was
startled
to
hear
a
sound
behind
her
glancing
round
she
beheld
a
little
white
figure
distinct
against
an
oak
bookcase
and
could
just
discern
two
large
wistful
eyes
looking
earnestly
at
her
the
next
moment
the
child
had
sprung
into
her
arms
sobbing
passionately
at
he
knew
not
what
but
as
his
paroxysm
subsided
whispering
with
shy
urgency
play
in
various
ways
the
boy
robert
was
noticeably
precocious
he
could
not
remember
a
time
he
said
when
he
did
not
rhyme
and
his
sister
records
that
as
a
very
little
boy
he
used
to
walk
around
the
table
spanning
out
on
the
smooth
mahogany
the
scansion
of
verses
he
had
composed
some
of
these
early
lines
he
could
recall
and
he
could
recall
too
the
prodigious
satisfaction
with
which
he
uttered
them
especially
the
sentence
he
put
into
the
mouth
of
a
man
who
had
just
committed
murder
now
my
soul
is
satisfied
at
twelve
he
had
a
volume
named
ready
for
publication
to
discerning
eyes
the
little
volume
was
a
production
of
great
promise
dominated
though
it
was
by
the
influence
of
his
father
idol
pope
and
of
his
own
temporary
ruling
deity
byron
but
a
publisher
was
not
found
and
in
later
years
at
browning
request
the
two
extant
manuscript
copies
of
were
destroyed
along
with
many
others
of
his
youthful
poems
that
had
been
preserved
by
his
father
browning
early
tastes
in
the
realm
of
poetry
were
on
the
whole
romantic
now
here
is
the
truth
he
wrote
to
miss
barrett
the
first
book
i
ever
bought
in
my
life
was
ossian
and
years
before
that
the
first
i
ever
was
guilty
of
was
something
in
of
ossian
whom
i
had
not
read
but
through
two
or
three
scraps
in
other
books
but
the
decisive
literary
influence
was
yet
to
come
when
he
was
fourteen
he
happened
to
see
on
a
bookstall
a
volume
marked
shelley
atheistical
poem
very
scarce
and
he
at
once
wished
to
know
more
of
this
shelley
after
a
perplexing
search
his
mother
found
the
desired
poems
most
of
them
in
first
editions
at
the
olliers
vere
street
london
she
took
home
also
three
volumes
by
another
poet
john
keats
who
she
was
told
was
the
subject
of
an
elegy
by
shelley
browning
never
forgot
the
may
evening
when
he
first
read
these
new
books
to
the
accompaniment
he
said
of
two
nightingales
one
in
a
one
in
a
laburnum
each
striving
to
outdo
the
other
in
melody
a
new
imaginative
world
was
opened
to
the
boy
in
he
afterwards
recorded
the
strong
intellectual
and
emotional
excitement
the
thrill
and
ecstasy
of
this
poetical
experience
to
shelley
especially
did
he
give
immediate
and
fervid
personal
loyalty
even
to
the
extent
of
endeavoring
to
follow
him
in
atheism
and
vegetarianism
when
at
fourteen
the
boy
left
ready
school
it
was
decided
that
his
further
education
should
be
carried
on
at
home
under
private
tutors
he
studied
music
under
able
masters
one
in
and
one
in
execution
he
played
and
sang
and
he
composed
spirited
settings
for
songs
he
read
voraciously
he
took
lessons
in
dancing
riding
boxing
and
fencing
and
is
said
to
have
shown
himself
exceptionally
active
and
vigorous
he
kept
up
his
interest
in
art
and
he
practiced
drawing
from
casts
he
found
time
also
for
various
friendships
for
miss
eliza
and
miss
sarah
flower
two
sisters
nine
and
seven
years
his
senior
he
had
a
deep
affection
both
young
ladies
were
gifted
in
music
and
this
was
one
source
of
their
attractions
for
the
boy
miss
sarah
flower
wrote
sacred
hymns
the
best
known
of
which
is
nearer
my
god
to
thee
and
her
sister
composed
music
which
browning
even
in
his
mature
years
ranked
as
of
especial
significance
other
friends
of
this
period
were
joseph
arnold
afterwards
chief
justice
of
bombay
and
a
man
of
great
ability
alfred
domett
a
striking
and
interesting
personality
described
by
browning
in
a
poem
beginning
what
become
of
waring
and
referred
to
in
the
guardian
angel
and
the
three
silverthorne
boys
his
cousins
the
death
of
one
of
whom
was
the
occasion
of
the
poem
may
and
death
in
spite
of
friends
a
beautiful
home
and
congenial
work
this
period
of
home
tutelage
does
not
seem
to
have
been
altogether
happy
his
sister
in
commenting
on
this
period
said
the
fact
was
poor
boy
he
had
outgrown
his
social
surroundings
they
were
absolutely
good
but
they
were
narrow
it
could
not
be
otherwise
he
chafed
under
them
furthermore
the
youth
before
he
had
found
his
real
work
as
a
poet
was
restless
irritable
and
opinionated
and
an
cause
of
friction
was
the
fact
that
there
were
few
subjects
of
taste
on
which
he
and
his
father
did
not
disagree
their
poetic
tastes
were
especially
at
variance
the
father
counted
pope
supreme
in
poetry
and
it
was
many
years
before
he
could
take
pleasure
in
the
form
in
which
his
genius
expressed
itself
all
the
more
noteworthy
then
is
the
generosity
with
which
browning
looked
after
his
son
interests
through
the
unprofitable
early
years
of
his
poetic
career
a
generosity
never
lost
sight
of
by
the
son
sharp
in
his
of
records
some
words
uttered
by
browning
a
week
or
two
before
his
death
which
show
how
permanent
was
his
sense
of
indebtedness
to
his
father
it
would
have
been
quite
unpardonable
in
my
case
he
said
not
to
have
done
my
best
my
dear
father
put
me
in
a
condition
most
favorable
for
the
best
work
i
was
capable
of
when
i
think
of
the
many
authors
who
have
had
to
fight
their
way
through
all
sorts
of
difficulties
i
have
no
reason
to
be
proud
of
my
achievements
he
secured
for
me
all
the
care
and
comfort
that
a
literary
man
needs
to
do
good
work
it
would
have
been
shameful
if
i
had
not
done
my
best
to
realize
his
expectations
of
me
after
it
was
determined
that
robert
should
commence
poet
he
and
his
father
came
to
the
conclusion
that
a
university
training
had
many
elements
foreign
to
the
aim
the
youth
had
set
before
him
and
that
a
richer
and
more
directly
available
preparation
could
be
gained
from
sedulous
cultivation
of
the
powers
of
his
mind
at
home
and
from
seeing
life
in
the
best
sense
at
home
and
abroad
orr
tells
us
that
the
first
qualifying
step
of
the
zealous
young
poet
was
to
read
and
digest
the
whole
of
johnson
browning
first
published
poem
appeared
anonymously
in
january
when
he
was
twenty
years
old
this
poem
is
of
especial
autobiographical
interest
its
enthusiastic
praise
of
shelley
recalls
his
early
devotion
to
that
poet
and
in
many
scattered
passages
we
find
references
to
his
own
personality
or
experiences
the
following
lines
show
with
what
intensity
he
recreated
the
lives
and
scenes
in
the
books
he
read
and
i
myself
went
with
the
tale
a
god
wandering
after
beauty
or
a
giant
standing
vast
in
the
sunset
an
old
hunter
talking
with
gods
or
a
chief
sailing
with
troops
of
friends
to
tenedos
i
tell
you
naught
has
ever
been
so
clear
as
the
place
the
time
the
fashion
of
those
lives
i
had
not
seen
a
work
of
lofty
art
nor
woman
beauty
nor
sweet
nature
face
yet
i
say
never
morn
broke
clear
as
those
on
the
dim
clustered
isles
in
the
blue
sea
the
deep
groves
and
white
temples
and
wet
caves
and
nothing
ever
will
surprise
me
now
who
stood
beside
the
naked
who
bound
my
forehead
with
proserpine
hair
there
is
true
and
powerful
in
the
lines
beginning
i
am
made
up
of
an
intensest
life
and
the
invocation
in
lines
reveals
the
passionately
religious
nature
of
the
young
poet
in
early
writings
of
robert
gosse
gives
an
account
of
the
impression
made
by
this
poem
upon
men
so
diverse
as
the
rev
william
johnson
fox
john
stuart
mill
and
dante
gabriel
rossetti
to
all
of
whom
in
spite
of
its
crudities
and
very
evident
immaturity
it
seemed
a
production
of
exceptional
promise
after
an
interval
of
two
years
browning
published
this
time
under
his
own
name
a
second
long
poem
the
subject
paracelsus
had
been
suggested
by
the
friend
amédeé
de
to
whom
the
poem
is
dedicated
in
pursuance
of
his
purposed
rehabilitation
of
a
vanished
age
browning
made
extensive
researches
in
the
british
museum
into
the
history
of
paracelsus
the
great
leader
in
sixteenth
century
medical
science
but
in
the
poem
the
facts
are
subordinated
to
a
minute
analysis
of
the
spiritual
history
of
paracelsus
the
poem
was
too
abstruse
in
subject
and
style
to
bring
browning
popularity
but
his
genius
was
recognized
by
important
critics
and
though
he
was
but
he
was
admitted
into
the
foremost
literary
circles
of
london
one
of
his
most
distinguished
new
friends
was
macready
the
great
actor
it
was
at
his
house
that
browning
first
met
forster
who
had
already
written
favorable
critiques
of
one
for
and
one
for
new
monthly
other
literary
associates
of
this
period
were
leigh
hunt
barry
cornwall
sergeant
talfourd
dickens
and
walter
savage
landor
there
were
not
infrequent
dinners
and
suppers
to
which
the
young
poet
was
welcomed
he
is
described
as
being
at
this
period
singularly
handsome
he
looks
and
acts
said
macready
more
like
a
youthful
poet
than
any
man
i
ever
saw
he
had
sculpturesque
masses
of
dark
wavy
hair
a
skin
like
delicate
ivory
expressive
eyes
and
a
sensitive
mouth
he
was
slender
graceful
and
most
attractive
in
manner
and
he
was
something
of
a
dandy
in
his
attention
to
dress
he
is
said
to
have
made
an
especially
good
impression
on
one
occasion
when
the
circumstances
must
have
been
as
trying
as
they
were
exhilarating
in
may
a
group
of
poets
had
assembled
at
talfourd
to
celebrate
macready
successful
production
of
talfourd
browning
sat
opposite
macready
who
was
between
wordsworth
and
landor
when
talfourd
proposed
a
toast
the
poets
of
england
he
spoke
in
complimentary
terms
of
wordsworth
and
landor
but
called
for
a
response
from
the
youngest
of
the
poets
of
england
the
author
of
landor
raised
his
cup
to
the
young
man
and
wordsworth
shook
hands
with
him
across
the
table
saying
i
am
proud
to
know
you
mr
browning
browning
third
literary
venture
was
a
tragedy
dedicated
to
macready
at
whose
request
it
was
written
the
drama
presents
the
impeachment
condemnation
and
execution
of
the
earl
of
strafford
a
statesman
who
according
to
the
play
loved
the
unworthy
king
charles
the
first
and
sacrificed
everything
even
to
life
itself
in
his
blind
loyalty
to
a
master
who
treacherously
deserted
him
in
the
hour
of
need
it
was
a
topic
to
which
browning
had
already
given
much
thought
for
he
had
the
preceding
year
completed
from
materials
supplied
by
john
forster
a
of
begun
by
forster
for
lardner
british
the
question
of
the
historic
truthfulness
of
the
drama
is
discussed
by
the
historian
gardiner
in
the
introduction
to
miss
emily
hickey
edition
of
he
shows
that
the
play
is
in
its
details
and
even
in
the
very
roots
of
the
situation
untrue
to
fact
and
yet
he
maintains
that
in
the
chief
characters
there
is
essential
truth
of
conception
every
time
that
i
read
the
play
says
gardiner
i
feel
more
certain
that
browning
has
seized
the
real
strafford
charles
too
with
his
faults
perhaps
exaggerated
is
nevertheless
the
real
charles
the
play
was
produced
at
covent
garden
theater
in
may
with
macready
as
strafford
and
miss
helen
faucit
as
lady
carlisle
and
was
successful
in
spite
of
poor
scenery
and
costuming
and
poor
acting
in
some
of
the
parts
but
owing
to
the
financial
condition
of
the
theater
and
the
consequent
withdrawal
of
one
of
the
important
actors
after
the
fifth
night
the
play
had
but
a
brief
run
it
was
presented
again
in
under
the
auspices
of
the
browning
society
and
its
power
as
an
acting
play
surprised
and
impressed
the
audience
before
the
composition
of
browning
had
begun
a
long
poem
which
he
completed
after
his
first
visit
to
italy
in
and
published
in
no
one
of
his
poems
is
more
difficult
to
read
and
many
are
the
stories
told
of
the
dismay
occasioned
by
its
various
perplexities
the
effect
of
this
poem
on
browning
fame
was
disastrous
in
fact
after
there
began
a
period
twenty
years
long
of
almost
complete
indifference
in
england
to
browning
work
the
enthusiasm
over
the
promise
of
his
early
poems
died
quite
away
late
in
life
browning
commented
on
this
period
of
his
literary
career
as
a
time
of
prolonged
desolateness
yet
the
years
are
the
years
in
which
he
attained
his
poetic
maturity
and
years
in
which
he
did
some
of
his
best
work
during
this
period
he
brought
out
the
series
somewhat
fancifully
called
and
the
phrase
itself
comes
from
xxviii
as
a
title
browning
explained
it
to
mean
something
like
a
mixture
of
music
with
discoursing
sound
with
sense
poetry
with
thought
this
cheap
serial
edition
the
separate
numbers
of
which
sold
at
first
at
sixpence
and
later
at
half
a
crown
included
victor
and
king
return
of
the
blot
in
the
romances
and
and
soul
all
of
browning
plays
except
and
a
came
out
of
this
series
the
most
beautiful
of
them
all
appeared
in
it
is
hardly
a
drama
at
all
in
the
conventional
sense
though
it
has
one
scene
that
between
ottima
and
sebald
of
the
highest
dramatic
power
but
it
has
always
been
a
favorite
with
readers
when
it
was
published
miss
barrett
wrote
to
browning
that
she
found
it
in
her
heart
to
covet
the
authorship
of
this
poem
more
than
any
other
of
his
works
and
he
said
in
answer
that
he
too
liked
better
than
anything
else
he
had
yet
done
sharp
while
emphasizing
the
undramatic
quality
of
the
play
counts
it
the
most
imperishable
because
the
most
nearly
immaculate
of
browning
dramatic
poems
it
seems
to
me
he
adds
like
all
simple
and
beautiful
things
profound
enough
for
the
sinking
plummet
of
the
most
curious
explorer
of
the
depths
of
life
it
can
be
read
learned
by
heart
and
the
more
it
is
known
the
wider
and
more
alluring
are
the
avenues
of
imaginative
thought
which
it
discloses
it
has
more
than
any
other
long
composition
by
its
author
that
quality
of
symmetry
that
recorded
of
leonardo
da
vinci
in
the
latin
epitaph
of
platino
piatto
and
as
might
be
expected
its
mental
basis
what
rossetti
called
fundamental
brain
work
is
as
luminous
depth
within
depth
as
the
morning
air
everyone
who
knows
browning
at
all
knows
of
the
seven
dramas
published
in
and
there
is
comparatively
little
stage
history
to
record
in
spite
of
occasional
fairly
successful
productions
it
must
be
admitted
that
browning
plays
have
never
achieved
probably
never
will
achieve
popularity
in
the
shape
of
long
runs
in
many
cities
they
are
too
subjective
too
analytic
too
psychological
for
quick
or
easy
understanding
but
to
the
reader
they
offer
many
delights
the
stories
are
clear
coherent
interesting
the
characters
strongly
individualized
the
crises
of
experience
stimulating
the
interaction
of
personalities
subtly
analyzed
the
poetry
noble
and
beautiful
the
two
numbers
of
and
were
no
and
romances
and
no
the
first
included
such
poems
as
cavalier
tunes
in
a
gondola
porphyria
and
the
pied
piper
of
hamelin
the
second
included
how
they
brought
the
good
news
from
ghent
to
aix
the
lost
leader
the
tomb
at
praxed
the
flight
of
the
duchess
the
boy
and
the
angel
and
the
first
part
of
saul
these
poems
together
with
the
dramas
make
a
remarkably
rich
body
of
poetry
to
be
produced
in
the
short
space
of
five
years
and
the
character
of
the
work
its
variety
and
beauty
and
strength
and
originality
were
such
that
its
meager
and
grudging
acceptance
seems
now
inexplicable
the
most
important
event
in
the
life
of
browning
during
this
period
was
his
acquaintance
with
miss
elizabeth
barrett
in
she
brought
out
a
new
volume
of
poems
which
he
saw
and
greatly
admired
he
wrote
to
her
expressing
delight
in
her
work
and
asking
permission
to
call
but
miss
barrett
owing
to
invalidism
had
lived
in
almost
entire
seclusion
and
she
was
not
at
first
willing
to
receive
browning
this
was
in
january
and
many
letters
passed
between
them
before
the
first
interview
in
the
following
may
browning
love
for
miss
barrett
found
almost
immediate
expression
and
she
was
soon
conscious
of
an
equally
strong
love
for
him
but
for
a
considerable
time
she
persistently
refused
to
marry
him
to
her
mind
the
obstacles
were
almost
insurmountable
of
these
her
was
chief
she
could
not
consent
she
said
to
dim
the
prosperities
of
his
career
by
a
union
with
her
future
which
she
characterized
as
a
precarious
thing
a
thing
for
making
burdens
out
of
but
not
for
his
carrying
in
exchange
for
the
noble
extravagancies
of
his
love
she
could
bring
him
only
anxiety
and
more
sadness
than
he
was
born
to
this
obstacle
of
was
unexpectedly
modified
by
a
very
mild
winter
and
by
the
new
physical
vigor
brought
in
the
train
of
new
happiness
from
this
point
of
view
the
marriage
though
hazardous
was
practicable
by
the
end
of
the
summer
of
a
second
obstacle
lay
in
the
nature
and
opinions
of
miss
father
who
governed
even
his
children
by
an
incredible
system
of
patriarchal
absolutism
by
what
was
variously
termed
an
obliquity
of
the
will
an
eccentricity
a
monomania
he
had
decided
that
none
of
his
children
should
marry
and
on
this
point
he
demanded
passive
obedience
it
was
perfectly
clear
that
miss
barrett
could
not
gain
his
consent
to
her
marriage
and
so
after
long
hesitation
and
much
unhappiness
she
decided
to
marry
browning
without
that
consent
in
order
to
save
her
family
and
close
friends
from
the
blame
sure
to
fall
upon
them
for
the
remotest
sanction
of
her
marriage
her
plans
were
kept
an
absolute
secret
she
met
browning
at
marylebone
church
on
september
and
they
were
married
there
browning
returning
at
once
to
her
own
home
where
she
remained
till
a
week
later
when
she
started
for
italy
with
her
husband
the
wedding
was
then
announced
throughout
her
father
life
browning
endeavored
to
placate
him
for
she
devotedly
loved
him
and
she
had
been
his
favorite
child
but
in
vain
he
would
never
see
her
again
he
returned
her
letters
unopened
and
he
would
not
allow
her
to
be
spoken
of
in
his
presence
after
resting
a
week
in
paris
and
browning
went
on
to
pisa
where
they
remained
nearly
seven
months
the
miracle
of
the
pisa
life
was
browning
gain
in
health
you
are
not
you
are
was
jameson
exclamation
it
was
at
pisa
that
browning
came
to
know
of
the
sonnets
his
wife
had
written
during
the
progress
of
their
courtship
and
engagement
in
gosse
tells
the
story
as
browning
gave
it
to
him
one
day
early
in
their
breakfast
being
over
browning
went
upstairs
while
her
husband
stood
at
the
window
watching
the
street
till
the
table
could
be
cleared
he
was
presently
aware
of
someone
behind
him
although
the
servant
had
gone
it
was
browning
who
held
him
by
the
shoulder
to
prevent
his
turning
to
look
at
her
and
at
the
same
time
pushed
a
packet
of
papers
into
the
pocket
of
his
coat
she
told
him
to
read
that
and
to
tear
it
up
if
he
did
not
like
it
and
then
she
fled
again
to
her
room
browning
felt
at
once
that
he
had
no
right
to
keep
such
poetry
as
a
private
possession
i
dared
not
he
said
reserve
to
myself
the
finest
sonnets
written
in
any
language
since
shakespeare
they
were
accordingly
published
in
under
the
intentionally
mystifying
title
from
the
the
brownings
reached
florence
april
after
several
changes
they
were
in
may
established
in
the
home
in
which
they
remained
during
browning
life
it
was
a
suite
of
rooms
on
the
second
floor
of
the
palazzo
guidi
of
the
practical
side
of
this
early
florentine
life
browning
wrote
my
dear
brothers
have
the
illusion
that
nobody
should
marry
on
less
than
two
thousand
a
year
good
heavens
how
preposterous
it
does
seem
to
me
we
scarcely
spend
three
hundred
and
i
have
every
luxury
i
ever
had
and
which
it
would
be
so
easy
to
give
up
at
need
and
robert
would
sleep
i
think
if
an
unpaid
bill
dragged
itself
by
any
chance
into
another
week
he
says
that
when
people
get
into
pecuniary
difficulties
his
sympathies
always
go
with
the
butchers
and
the
bakers
in
accordance
with
this
horror
of
owing
five
shillings
five
days
the
furnishings
of
the
new
home
the
rococo
chairs
spring
sofas
carved
bookcases
satin
from
cardinals
beds
and
the
rest
were
accumulated
at
a
pace
dictated
by
the
bank
account
but
for
all
that
it
was
not
long
before
the
rooms
began
to
take
on
an
aspect
as
beautiful
as
it
was
homelike
by
preference
the
brownings
lived
very
quietly
at
the
end
of
fifteen
months
browning
wrote
robert
has
not
been
out
an
evening
of
the
fifteen
months
but
what
with
music
and
books
and
writing
and
talking
we
scarcely
know
how
the
days
go
it
such
a
gallop
on
the
grass
march
was
born
wiedemann
later
known
as
penini
or
pen
browning
coincident
with
this
joy
was
the
grief
caused
by
the
death
of
browning
mother
a
sorrow
from
which
he
rallied
but
slowly
the
florentine
life
was
occasionally
varied
by
summers
at
bagni
di
lucca
winters
in
paris
or
rome
and
several
visits
to
england
there
was
also
an
increasing
social
life
americans
were
especially
welcome
to
the
brownings
because
while
england
was
still
indifferent
to
work
america
had
given
it
an
appreciative
welcome
in
march
browning
wrote
i
do
complain
for
myself
of
an
unappreciative
public

no
but
just
for
reason
i
complain
more
about
robert
in
america
he
is
a
power
a
writer
a
poet
he
is
read
he
lives
in
the
hearts
of
the

hiram

the

were
among

chief
delights
in
florence
george

in
describing
the
trip
to
vallombrosa
says
that
it
was
part
of
their
pleasure
to
sit
in
the
dusky
convent
chapel
while
browning
at
the
organ
chased
a
fugue
of
master
hughes
of
saxe
gotha
or
dreamed
out
upon
twilight
keys
a
faint
throbbing
toccata
of
galuppi
modeling
in
clay
was
even
more
satisfying
as
a
personal
resource
in
the
autumn
of
browning
wrote
robert
has
taken
to
modeling
under
story
at
his
studio
and
is
making
extraordinary
progress
turning
to
account
his
studies
in
anatomy
he
has
copied
already
two

the
more
tired
he
has
been
and
the
more
his
back
ached
poor
fellow
the
more
he
has
exulted
and
been
happy
nothing
ever
made
him
so
happy
he
found
also
an
unfailing
pleasure
in
the
study
of
great
pictures

he
was
a
buyer
of
pictures
with
a
collector

in
hunting
out
the
work
of
the
unappreciated
early
tuscan
artists
orr
says
that
he
owned
at
least
one
picture
by
each
of
the
obscure
artists
mentioned
in
old
pictures
in
florence
browning
sometimes
expressed
regret
that
browning
should
give
himself
so
unreservedly
in
so
many
directions
because
she
felt
that
he
had
thus
too
little
time
and
energy
left
for
poetry
her
fear
was
not
without
justification
for
after
the
richly
productive
period
from
to
we
come
upon
a
space
of
nine
years
the
only
publications
of
which
are
in
eve
and
easter
a
long
poem
in
two
parts
giving
the
arguments
in
favor
of
christianity
and
in
an
introduction
to

collection
of

supposed
to
be
by
shelley
but
since
found
to
be
spurious
the
essay
is
nevertheless
of
importance
as
an
exposition
of
browning
theory
of
poetry
and
as
an
interesting
study
of
shelley
in
at
the
close
of
this
period
of
nine
years
there
appeared
a
collection
of
poems
entitled
and
in
fundamental
brain
power
insight
beauty
and
mastery
of
style
these
poems
show
browning
at
the
highest
level
of
his
poetic
achievement
it
is
in
these
remarkable
poems
that
he
brought
to
perfection
a
poetic
form
which
he
practically
invented
the
dramatic
monologue
a
form
in
which
there
is
but
one
speaker
but
which
is
essentially
dramatic
in
effect
the
dramatic
quality
arises
partly
from
the
implied
presence
of
listeners
whose
expressions
of
assent
or
dissent
determine
the
progress
or
the
abrupt
changes
of
direction
of
the
speaker
words
in
andrea
del
sarto
for
example
lucrezia
smiles
and
frowns
and
gestures
of
impatience
are
a
constant
influence
and
the
poem
presents
as
vivid
an
interplay
of
personalities
as
any
scene
in
a
drama
but
the
implied
listener
is
hardly
more
than
a
secondary
dramatic
element
the
chief
one
being
that
the
speaker
talks
as
do
the
characters
in
a
play
out
of
the
demands
of
the
immediate
experience
gradually
and
casually
disclosing
all
the
tangled
web
of
influence
all
the
clashes
of
will
with
destiny
of
desire
with
convention
that
have
led
to
the
crisis
depicted
fra
lippo
lippi
gives
no
consecutive
history
of
his
life
only
such
snatches
of
it
as
partially
account
for
his
present
mad
freak
but
the
strife
between
his
own
nature
and
instinct
on
the
one
hand
and
the
conventions
and
traditions
of
religious
art
on
the
other
could
hardly
be
more
vividly
presented
a
the
one
drama
in
and
has
but
a
fragment
of
a
plot
but
in
intensity
reality
and
passion
it
excels
most
of
browning
dramas
and
in
spite
of
its
long
speeches
has
proved
effective
on
the
stage
in
variety
of
theme
and
the
poems
of
and
defy
classification
whatever
page
one
turns
there
is
something
novel
stimulating
captivating
all
of
browning
florentine
interests
are
represented
here
his
love
of
old
pictures
and
music
his
delight
in
florence
venice
rome
in
all
italy
her
skies
and
her
landscapes
the
vagrants
of
her
streets
her
religious
ceremonies
her
church
dignitaries
her
scholars
then
there
are
in
all
tones
and
tempers
the
noblest
of
them
all
one
word
more
being
browning
most
direct
and
personal
tribute
to
his
wife
and
we
see
in
its
keenest
form
his
intellectual
delight
in
subtle
disquisition
the
doctrine
of
immortality
as
it
appeals
to
the
mind
of
the
cultured
dissatisfied
pagan
cleon
the
miracle
of
lazarus
as
it
is
brooded
over
by
the
arab
physician
karshish
the
balancing
of
faith
and
doubt
in
the
clever
casuistry
of
bishop
blougram
these
are
topics
to
taste
and
are
treated
with
skill
and
mastery
taken
all
in
all
these
poems
give
to
the
reader
a
full
impression
of
browning
characteristic
force
the
darting
penetrating
power
of
his
phrase
the
rush
and
energy
and
leap
of
his
thought
it
is
by
and
the
somewhat
similar
and
the
earlier
and
that
browning
is
most
widely
and
most
favorably
known
during
the
first
ten
years
that
the
brownings
were
in
florence
browning
health
was
so
good
that
she
was
able
to
enjoy
social
and
outdoor
pleasures
to
a
degree
that
would
have
been
thought
impossible
before
her
marriage
she
had
also
kept
up
her
literary
work
a
new
edition
of
her
poems
appeared
in
in
she
published
guidi
poems
illustrative
of
her
ardent
interest
in
all
that
pertained
to
the
fight
for
italian
freedom
and
in
her
verse
novel
was
completed
and
published
but
soon
after
this
her
strength
began
insensibly
to
fail
and
during
the
last
three
years
of
her
life
she
suffered
much
from
repeated
bronchial
attacks
however
her
death
in
june
was
entirely
unexpected
the
florentines
had
loved
her
deeply
and
had
appreciated
her
utterances
in
behalf
of
a
free
italy
she
was
accordingly
buried
in
florence
with
extraordinary
demonstrations
of
respect
and
the
house
where
she
had
lived
was
marked
by
the
municipality
with
a
commemorative
tablet
browning
wish
was
to
leave
florence
at
once
and
to
make
the
new
life
as
unlike
the
old
as
possible
he
went
to
london
and
after
some
delay
established
himself
in
a
house
at
warwick
crescent
where
he
lived
till
the
first
portion
of
his
life
in
england
was
one
of
unbearable
loneliness
he
took
care
of
his
son
busied
himself
with
a
new
edition
of
his
wife
poems
read
and
studied
and
wrote
with
feverish
intensity
and
avoided
people
but
with
the
spring
of
says
gosse
a
great
change
came
over
browning
habits
he
had
shunned
all
invitations
into
society
but
it
suddenly
occurred
to
him
that
this
mode
of
life
was
morbid
and
unworthy
and
thereupon
he
entered
into
the
social
literary
musical
and
artistic
life
of
london
the
nine
years
following
were
again
a
period
of
small
productivity
was
a
slender
volume
to
represent
so
many
years
even
though
it
contained
such
great
poems
as
rabbi
ben
ezra
a
death
in
the
desert
and
abt
vogler
but
during
this
period
a
long
poem
ring
and
the
had
been
maturing
in
while
still
at
casa
guidi
browning
had
found
at
a
the
now
famous
square
old
yellow
book
containing
the
legal
record
of
a
famous
roman
murder
case
he
read
the
account
on
the
way
home
and
before
night
had
so
mastered
the
details
that
as
he
paced
up
and
down
on
the
terrace
in
the
darkness
he
saw
the
tragedy
unfold
before
him
in
picture
after
picture
it
was
not
however
till
that
he
definitely
set
to
work
on
the
composition
of
the
poem
it
was
published
in
four
volumes
of
three
parts
each
in
the
winter
and
spring
of
the
poem
has
a
novel
structure
the
story
is
retold
ten
times
by
different
persons
and
with
such
variations
of
fact
and
opinions
and
style
as
are
dictated
by
the
knowledge
and
the
character
of
the
speaker
the
monologues
of
count
guido
who
murdered
his
wife
of
pompilia
the
young
wife
of
caponsacchi
the
soldier
saint
who
endeavored
to
save
her
and
of
the
old
pope
are
by
far
the
most
interesting
portions
of
the
poem
but
the
whole
of
it
is
remarkable
and
it
justly
takes
rank
as
one
of
england
greatest
poems
with
the
appearance
of
this
book
browning
genius
received
adequate
recognition
in
high
places
called
it
the
of
the
generation
not
merely
beyond
all
parallel
the
supremest
poetic
achievement
of
the
time
but
the
most
precious
and
profound
spiritual
treasure
that
england
has
possessed
since
the
days
of
shakespeare
the
last
ten
or
twelve
years
of
browning
life
were
so
crowded
with
interests
occupations
publications
friends
honors
that
not
even
a
summary
of
them
can
be
undertaken
here
sharp
says
of
this
period
everybody
wished
him
to
come
and
dine
and
he
did
his
best
to
gratify
everybody
he
saw
everything
read
all
the
notable
books
kept
himself
acquainted
with
the
leading
contents
of
the
journals
and
magazines
conducted
a
large
correspondence
read
new
french
german
and
italian
books
of
mark
read
and
translated
euripides
and
æschylus
knew
all
the
gossip
of
the
literary
clubs
the
salons
and
the
studios
was
a
frequenter
of
afternoon
tea
parties
and
then
over
and
above
it
he
was
browning
the
most
profoundly
subtle
mind
that
has
exercised
itself
in
poetry
since
shakespeare
henry
james
in
commenting
on
browning
rich
and
ample
london
period
with
its
felicities
and
prosperities
of
every
sort
says
that
in
contemplating
the
wonderful
browning
the
accomplished
saturated
sane
sound
man
of
the
london
world
and
the
world
of
culture
it
was
impossible
not
to
believe
that
he
had
arrived
somehow
for
his
own
deep
purposes
at
the
enjoyment
of
a
double
identity
so
dissociated
were
the
poet
and
the
member
of
society
phillips
brooks
who
met
browning
in
england
in
was
impressed
by
his
fullness
of
life
and
said
he
was
very
like
some
of
the
best
of
thackeray
london
men
in
public
and
on
ordinary
social
occasions
browning
is
said
to
have
been
frank
charming
friendly
more
agreeable
mary
anderson
said
than
distinguished
with
intimate
friends
however
the
poet
had
quite
another
sort
of
charm
to
a
single
listener
says
gosse
with
whom
he
was
on
familiar
terms
the
browning
of
his
own
study
was
to
the
browning
of
a
dinner
party
as
a
tiger
cat
is
to
a
domestic
cat
in
such
conversation
his
natural
strength
came
out
his
talk
assumed
the
volume
and
the
tumult
of
a
cascade
his
voice
rose
to
a
shout
sank
to
a
whisper
ran
up
and
down
the
gamut
of
conversational
melody
those
whom
he
was
expecting
will
never
forget
his
welcome
the
loud
from
the
other
end
of
the
passage
the
talk
already
in
full
flood
at
a
distance
of
twenty
feet
then
in
his
own
study
or
what
he
loved
was
to
capture
his
visitor
in
a
low
armchair
of
leather
and
from
a
most
unfair
vantage
of
height
to
tyrannize
to
walk
around
the
victim
in
front
behind
on
this
side
on
that
weaving
magic
circles
now
with
gesticulating
arms
thrown
high
now
groveling
on
the
floor
to
find
some
reference
in
a
folio
talking
all
the
while
a
redundant
turmoil
of
thoughts
fancies
and
reminiscences
flowing
from
those
generous
lips
elsewhere
gosse
summed
up
his
personal
impressions
of
browning
as
follows
i
am
bound
to
tell
you
that
i
saw
a
different
browning
from
the
hero
of
all
the
handbooks
and
which
are
now
in
vogue
people
are
beginning
to
treat
this
vehement
and
honest
poet
as
if
he
were
a
sort
of
marcus
aurelius
and
john
the
baptist
rolled
into
one
i
have
just
seen
a
book
in
which
it
is
proposed
that
browning
should
supersede
the
bible
in
which
it
is
asserted
that
a
set
of
his
volumes
will
teach
religion
better
than
all
the
theologies
in
the
world
well
i
did
not
know
that
holy
monster
what
i
saw
was
an
unostentatious
keen
active
man
of
the
world
one
who
never
failed
to
give
good
practical
advice
in
matters
of
business
and
conduct
one
who
loved
his
friends
and
certainly
hated
his
enemies
a
man
alive
in
every
eager
passionate
nerve
of
him
a
man
who
loved
to
discuss
people
and
affairs
and
a
bit
of
a
gossip
a
bit
of
a
partisan
too
and
not
without
his
humorous
prejudices
he
was
simple
to
a
high
degree
simple
in
his
scrupulous
dress
his
loud
happy
voice
his
insatiable
curiosity
browning
london
life
was
varied
by
many
summer
journeyings
to
french
towns
to
wales
and
to
scotland
but
it
was
seventeen
years
after
the
death
of
his
wife
before
he
could
bring
himself
to
revisit
italy
even
then
he
avoided
florence
he
took
his
sister
to
northern
italy
and
asolo
and
venice
became
the
towns
around
which
their
affections
centered
two
american
friends
and
arthur
bronson
contributed
to
the
happiness
of
these
italian
sojourns
in
browning
son
who
had
married
an
american
girl
bought
the
palazzo
rezzonico
in
venice
so
that
browning
had
an
additional
personal
reason
for
his
trip
to
venice
in
he
was
well
and
he
took
great
pleasure
in
his
son
admirably
planned
restoration
of
the
old
venetian
palace
he
worked
walked
talked
with
nearly
normal
vigor
but
a
bronchial
attack
proved
more
than
his
weakened
heart
could
withstand
and
he
died
peacefully
almost
painlessly
in
his
son
home
on
december
on
the
day
of
his
death
his
last
book
was
published
so
that
his
epilogue
was
really
his
valediction
to
this
and
his
heroic
greeting
to
another
world
he
could
greet
the
unseen
with
a
cheer
because
in
thought
and
act
he
was
one
who
never
turned
his
back
but
marched
breast
forward
never
doubted
clouds
would
break
never
dreamed
though
right
were
worsted
wrong
would
triumph
held
we
fall
to
rise
are
baffled
to
fight
better
sleep
to
wake
browning
was
buried
in
westminster
abbey
on
the
last
day
of
the
year
the
most
pathetic
element
of
the
imposing
ceremonies
was
the
singing
of
browning
poem
he
giveth
his
beloved
sleep
the
poetry
of
browning
before
entering
upon
a
discussion
of
browning
poetry
it
will
be
of
interest
to
note
briefly
some
of
the
more
striking
general
characteristics
of
the
english
literature
contemporary
with
his
work
from
to
is
over
half
a
century
but
as
a
central
and
especially
significant
portion
of
browning
career
we
may
take
the
three
decades
from
when
he
began
the
and
series
to
when
ring
and
the
appeared
for
these
years
include
all
of
his
dramas
and
most
of
the
poetry
on
which
his
fame
rests
a
survey
of
this
period
at
once
reveals
the
predominance
of
fiction
within
these
years
come
nearly
all
the
novels
of
charles
dickens
of
william
makepeace
thackeray
of
charlotte
brontë
of
wilkie
collins
of
charles
kingsley
of
gaskell
of
anthony
trollope
of
george
macdonald
of
charles
reade
much
of
the
work
of
bulwer
lytton
all
the
novels
of
george
eliot
except
and
and
the
earliest
of
george
meredith
books
this
is
a
notable
showing
no
previous
period
in
english
literature
had
presented
anything
like
so
wide
a
range
in
fiction
or
had
brought
forward
so
large
a
number
of
novels
of
the
first
rank
these
years
were
equally
rich
in
essays
including
much
of
carlyle
work
all
of
macaulay
except
the
early
essay
on
milton
the
religious
polemics
of
frederick
dennison
maurice
and
john
henry
newman
nearly
all
of
ruskin
discussions
of
art
and
social
history
most
of
leigh
hunt
literary
criticism
and
matthew
arnold
important
early
critical
essays
this
too
is
a
notable
showing
but
if
we
turn
to
the
two
realms
in
which
browning
excelled
poetry
and
drama
we
find
different
conditions
during
the
central
period
of
his
career
there
was
aside
from
his
own
work
not
a
single
important
drama
published
the
theaters
were
prosperous
but
they
brought
out
only
old
plays
or
new
ones
of
inferior
rank
in
poetry
too
if
we
set
aside
the
great
names
of
tennyson
and
browning
the
period
was
neither
rich
nor
varied
during
browning
first
great
productive
period
the
only
other
poems
of
note
were
tennyson
two
volumes
in
in
the
nine
years
from
to
and
in
the
chief
poems
were
tennyson
and
for
though
wordsworth
was
one
of
the
greatest
publications
of
the
it
was
written
years
before
and
can
hardly
be
counted
as
belonging
to
this
era
there
are
during
the
decade
many
poems
of
secondary
rank
the
most
important
of
them
being
browning
from
the
and
but
besides
tennyson
and
browning
the
only
poet
of
high
rank
is
matthew
arnold
whose
slender
volumes
voice
the
doubts
and
difficulties
of
the
age
as
browning
poems
voice
its
optimism
in
the
fourteen
years
between
and
and
ring
and
the
poets
of
a
new
kind
appear
william
morris
of
life
and
death
of
and
earthly
and
swinburne
early
poems
are
alien
to
the
work
of
browning
in
form
and
ideals
the
fact
is
the
more
definitely
we
try
to
place
browning
in
his
literary
environment
the
more
distinctly
do
we
perceive
that
he
was
among
his
contemporaries
he
combined
in
striking
fashion
the
intensity
of
the
poet
and
the
strong
social
sense
of
the
prose
writer
it
seems
also
wise
to
glance
at
the
outset
at
a
few
of
the
main
criticisms
that
have
been
made
on
browning
poetry
for
the
result
of
his
marked
originality
is
that
no
poet
of
the
time
has
been
so
greatly
praised
and
blamed
a
natural
first
topic
is
his
really
famous
obscurity
this
obscurity
is
variously
ascribed
to
a
diction
unduly
learned
or
almost
unintelligibly
colloquial
or
grotesquely
inventive
to
figures
of
speech
drawn
from
sources
too
unfamiliar
or
elaborated
to
the
point
of
confusion
to
sentences
complicated
by
startling
inversions
by
double
parentheses
by
broken
constructions
or
by
a
grammatical
structure
defying
analysis
it
would
be
quite
possible
to
illustrate
each
of
these
points
from
browning
works
and
it
can
not
be
denied
that
his
poetry
is
sometimes
needlessly
and
inexcusably
hard
reading
but
in
reality
the
difficulties
in
his
poems
come
less
from
stylistic
defects
than
from
the
subject
matter
what
chesterton
calls
browning
love
for
the
holes
and
corners
of
history
leads
him
to
the
use
of
much
unfamiliar
detail
a
large
part
of
the
difficulty
in
reading
arises
from
the
fact
that
all
browning
accumulated
knowledge
of
medieval
italy
is
there
poured
forth
in
an
allusive
manner
till
even
the
practiced
reader
turns
away
perplexed
and
overwhelmed
so
too
old
pictures
in
florence
pictor
ignotus
and
fra
lippo
lippi
assume
on
the
part
of
the
reader
a
minute
familiarity
with
early
florentine
art
occasionally
the
poems
demand
an
exceptional
technical
knowledge
of
some
sort
as
in
abt
vogler
where
only
a
trained
musician
can
fully
understand
the
terminology
many
even
of
the
minor
poems
belong
to
realms
of
thought
and
experience
so
remote
that
only
by
distinct
effort
do
we
transport
ourselves
thither
it
would
for
instance
be
absurd
to
call
two
in
the
campagna
difficult
in
form
or
phrasing
yet
it
narrates
an
experience
intelligible
only
to
those
who
have
loved
deeply
but
have
found
in
the
very
heart
of
that
love
a
baffling
sense
of
inevitable
personal
isolation
sometimes
the
difficulty
arises
from
the
extreme
subtlety
of
the
thought
evelyn
hope
the
simplest
of
poems
in
expression
presents
novel
and
elusive
ideas
chesterton
ingeniously
ascribes
browning
obscurity
to
intellectual
humility
to
an
assumption
that
his
readers
were
in
possession
of
a
native
endowment
and
an
acquired
intellectual
wealth
on
a
par
with
his
own
but
the
defense
seems
rather
forced
browning
gave
one
of
the
best
brief
analyses
of
browning
obscurity
he
had
been
attacked
as
being
misty
and
she
wrote
to
him
you
never
misty
not
even
in
never
vague
your
graver
cuts
deep
sharp
lines
always
and
there
is
an
extra
distinctness
in
your
images
and
thoughts
from
the
midst
of
which
crossing
each
other
infinitely
the
general
significance
seems
to
escape
but
the
classic
defense
of
browning
from
this
point
of
view
may
be
found
in
swinburne
introduction
to
chapman
the
difficulty
found
by
many
in
certain
of
browning
works
arises
from
a
quality
the
very
reverse
of
that
which
produces
obscurity
properly
obscurity
is
the
natural
product
of
turbid
forces
and
confused
ideas
of
a
feeble
and
clouded
or
of
a
vigorous
but
unfixed
and
chaotic
intellect
now
if
there
is
any
great
quality
more
perceptible
than
another
in
browning
intellect
it
is
his
decisive
and
incisive
faculty
of
thought
his
sureness
and
intensity
of
perception
his
rapid
and
trenchant
resolution
of
aim
the
very
essence
of
browning
aim
and
method
as
exhibited
in
the
ripest
fruits
of
his
intelligence
is
such
as
implies
above
all
other
things
the
possession
of
a
quality
the
very
opposite
of
obscurity
a
faculty
of
spiritual
illumination
rapid
and
intense
and
subtle
as
lightning
which
brings
to
bear
upon
its
object
by
way
of
direct
and
vivid
illustration
every
symbol
and
every
detail
on
which
its
light
is
flashed
in
passing
browning
has
himself
a
word
to
say
on
this
topic
he
wrote
to
a
friend
i
can
have
little
doubt
that
my
writing
has
been
in
the
main
too
hard
for
many
i
should
have
been
pleased
to
communicate
with
but
i
never
designedly
tried
to
puzzle
people
as
some
of
my
critics
have
supposed
on
the
other
hand
i
never
pretended
to
offer
such
literature
as
should
be
a
substitute
for
a
cigar
or
a
game
at
dominoes
to
an
idle
man
so
perhaps
on
the
whole
i
get
my
deserts
and
something
over
not
a
crowd
but
a
few
i
value
more
a
second
charge
not
infrequently
brought
against
browning
verse
is
that
it
is
harsh
and
at
times
even
ugly
this
charge
like
that
of
obscurity
can
not
be
wholly
denied
the
harshness
results
from
incorrect
rhymes
from
irregular
movement
of
the
verse
or
from
difficult
combinations
of
vowels
and
consonants
no
reader
of
browning
poems
can
fail
to
have
been
impressed
by
his
intellectual
agility
in
matching
odd
rhymes
in
dash
and
originality
his
rhymes
even
those
in
butler
and
lowell
for
we
find
in
for
instance
many
rhymes
of
the
gayest
most
freakish
most
grotesque
character
monkey
one
key
prelude
stubborn
hard
hazard
all
occur
in
a
single
stanza
an
example
of
exceptional
facility
in
rhyming
is
found
in
through
the
metidja
where
without
repetition
of
words
and
without
forcing
of
the
sense
words
rhyme
with
ride
it
can
not
be
denied
that
this
remarkable
facility
led
browning
occasionally
into
the
use
of
odd
rhymes
in
poems
where
no
light
or
comic
effect
was
intended
but
a
detailed
study
of
his
rhymes
shows
that
the
proportion
of
incorrect
rhymes
is
really
small
that
the
grotesque
rhymes
are
more
striking
than
numerous
and
that
they
are
usually
in
places
where
they
are
dramatically
appropriate
his
use
of
harsh
words
and
is
also
often
to
be
justified
on
the
ground
of
their
appropriateness
to
the
idea
compare
for
instance
the
flowing
easy
words
the
musical
linking
of
sounds
in
the
first
stanza
of
love
among
the
ruins
with
the
harsh
words
harshly
combined
in
the
twelfth
and
thirteenth
stanzas
of
childe
roland
both
effects
are
artistic
because
each
sort
of
combination
is
in
response
to
the
nature
of
the
thought
it
is
true
that
sometimes
perhaps
not
infrequently
the
verse
is
rugged
or
uncouth
where
the
sense
does
not
call
for
such
form
and
there
are
lines
that
not
only
remind
us
of
de
quincey
dictum
that
certain
words
should
be
boiled
before
they
are
eaten
but
which
have
no
metrical
flow
at
all
they
defy
any
sort
of
scansion
and
read
like
rough
prose
but
a
poet
has
a
right
of
appeal
to
the
sum
of
his
manifest
excellencies
rather
than
to
his
defects
and
if
we
take
browning
best
work
we
find
a
harmony
of
movement
superior
in
musical
effect
to
a
more
technically
regular
meter
in
many
poems
the
meter
is
indissolubly
fused
with
the
pictures
the
ideas
the
events
take
for
instance
the
pied
piper
of
hamelin
where
the
of
the
verse
is
in
complete
harmony
with
the
quaint
rapid
tale
the
of
galloping
horses
is
heard
all
through
how
they
brought
the
good
news
from
ghent
to
aix
the
slow
march
the
stately
chant
are
rhythmically
present
throughout
a
grammarian
funeral
in
the
flight
of
the
duchess
the
change
from
the
rough
servitor
narrative
to
the
incantation
of
the
is
as
exquisitely
marked
in
the
metrical
movement
and
in
the
rhymes
as
it
is
in
the
diction
and
tone
of
thought
many
other
examples
might
be
cited
brinton
who
has
made
a
detailed
and
competent
study
of
browning
verse
gives
his
final
opinion
in
these
words
in
the
volumes
of
browning
i
maintain
that
we
find
so
many
instances
of
profound
insight
into
verbal
harmonies
such
singular
strength
of
poetic
grouping
and
such
a
marvelous
grasp
of
the
rhythmic
properties
of
the
english
language
that
we
must
assign
to
him
a
rank
second
to
no
english
poet
of
this
century
a
third
charge
brought
against
browning
art
is
that
he
makes
all
his
characters
talk
browningese
that
is
that
he
endows
all
of
them
with
the
power
to
use
such
words
and
sentences
and
thought
processes
as
are
natural
to
him
and
to
him
only
stedman
in
emphasizing
this
characteristic
of
the
poet
says
of
the
usual
fault
is
present
the
characters
whether
students
peasants
or
soldiers
all
talk
like
sages
pippa
reasons
like
a
paracelsus
in
pantalettes
it
is
of
course
obvious
at
the
first
glance
that
there
is
a
lack
of
verisimilitude
in
pippa
rich
and
beautiful
soliloquies
certainly
no
mill
girl
could
so
describe
a
sunrise
or
play
so
brilliantly
with
a
sunbeam
in
a
or
outline
so
cleverly
the
stories
of
the
happiest
four
in
asolo
the
same
is
true
of
phene
long
speech
to
jules
no
untutored
girl
brought
up
in
degradation
could
present
such
thoughts
in
such
words
when
we
analyze
browning
way
of
presenting
a
character
however
we
find
that
the
lack
of
verisimilitude
is
usually
external
and
has
to
do
chiefly
with
expression
browning
works
on
the
fundamental
assumption
that
he
has
a
poetic
right
to
make
all
sorts
of
people
articulate
he
lends
his
mind
out
in
the
service
of
their
thoughts
and
feelings
he
makes
people
reveal
themselves
by
putting
into
words
their
elusive
dim
tangled
and
even
unrecognized
motives
and
hopes
and
joys
and
despairs
he
sums
up
in
the
speeches
all
the
potentialities
of
the
situation
all
the
significance
latent
in
the
type
of
character
and
environment
is
somehow
heightened
and
symbolized
all
this
is
put
in
his
own
highly
individual
diction
yet
it
can
hardly
be
said
that
he
violates
poetic
realism
in
the
deeper
sense
for
he
never
puts
a
halo
around
a
situation
never
goes
counter
to
its
potentialities
instead
he
strikes
fire
from
it
he
shows
what
is
actually
in
the
situation
but
at
white
heat
and
laid
bare
to
its
center
when
this
method
has
once
been
recognized
discomfort
on
the
score
of
lack
of
verisimilitude
practically
disappears
and
the
reader
yields
himself
to
the
joy
of
the
rich
subtle
and
stimulating
analysis
we
may
now
turn
to
a
consideration
of
the
and
the
main
ideas
of
browning
poetry
from
whatever
point
of
view
we
regard
his
work
we
find
that
ultimately
the
emphasis
rests
on
the
same
great
central
fact
the
supremacy
of
his
interest
in
human
nature
this
dominating
interest
is
shown
for
instance
by
a
study
of
his
treatment
of
physical
nature
to
be
sure
no
one
can
read
his
poems
without
recognizing
the
truth
that
his
use
of
natural
facts
is
distinctive
in
kind
and
very
stimulating
a
mere
reference
to
the
pictures
of
the
sky
in
the
vivid
descriptions
of
fruits
and
flowers
in
an
englishman
in
italy
the
remarkable
studies
of
small
animal
life
in
saul
and
caliban
upon
setebos
of
birds
in
from
abroad
of
insects
in
the
first
part
of
and
in
many
later
poems
suffices
to
show
that
in
mature
life
he
did
not
lose
the
keenness
of
observation
and
interest
characteristic
of
his
youth
yet
it
is
also
evident
that
his
use
of
nature
by
way
of
direct
description
or
even
as
illustrative
material
is
far
less
in
amount
than
that
of
other
notable
nineteenth
century
poets
he
cares
much
less
for
the
river
line
the
mountains
round
it
and
the
sky
above
than
for
the
figures
of
man
woman
and
child
these
are
frame
to
where
nature
is
drawn
upon
it
is
almost
invariably
in
complete
subordination
to
some
human
interest
and
its
literary
form
is
almost
always
that
of
casual
mention
background
or
similitude
and
the
first
of
these
is
the
most
frequent
furthermore
nearly
all
these
passages
are
a
mere
statement
of
observed
fact
without
comment
or
interpretation
there
is
one
great
passage
in
where
the
joy
of
god
in
the
act
of
creation
is
depicted
there
are
occasional
references
to
the
delight
of
man
in
the
external
world
and
now
and
then
as
in
by
the
fireside
man
and
nature
are
intimately
fused
but
such
conceptions
rarely
occur
in
browning
poetry
the
boundary
lines
between
man
and
nature
are
clearly
marked
in
he
definitely
protests
against
man
way
of
reading
his
own
moods
into
nature
and
of
attributing
to
her
his
own
qualities
and
emotions
he
also
always
accounts
man
if
he
has
truly
entered
into
his
spiritual
heritage
as
consciously
superior
to
nature
the
troubadour
eglamour
in
says
that
man
shrinks
to
naught
if
matched
with
a
quiet
sea
or
sky
but
browning
calls
that
eglamour
false
thought
to
browning
nature
was
to
be
studied
enjoyed
and
used
but
it
was
not
as
to
keats
a
realm
of
enchantment
or
as
to
wordsworth
the
realm
where
alone
the
divine
and
the
human
could
pass
the
boundaries
of
sense
and
meet
or
as
to
matthew
arnold
a
refuge
from
pain
and
disillusionment
browning
regards
the
world
about
him
more
in
the
sane
unsentimental
straightforward
intelligible
way
of
chaucer
or
of
shakespeare
the
mystical
elements
in
wordsworth
feeling
for
nature
were
foreign
to
browning
mind
an
instructive
comparison
might
be
made
between
wordsworth
ode
on
intimations
of
immortality
and
prologue
to
asolando
the
poems
have
the
same
starting
point
each
one
attributes
sadness
to
the
poet
old
age
and
each
gives
as
a
cause
of
the
sadness
the
inevitable
fading
of
the
glory
with
which
all
nature
was
invested
to
the
eye
of
his
youth
but
here
the
resemblance
ends
wordsworth
believes
that
the
youthful
vision
was
a
divine
revelation
to
be
regained
when
the
round
of
existence
should
be
completed
by
a
return
to
his
immortal
home
and
on
the
memory
of
that
vision
he
founded
his
faith
in
a
future
life
but
browning
welcomed
the
loss
of
the
vision
objects
had
been
to
him
palpably
but
with
the
loss
of
flame
there
was
a
gain
in
reality
the
vision
had
enthralled
and
subjugated
him
but
with
the
sight
of
a
naked
world
he
had
become
conscious
of
things
as
they
are
and
he
rejoiced
in
a
justness
of
perception
that
declared
what
were
to
him
the
two
great
facts
of
life
the
power
and
beauty
of
god
and
the
glory
of
the
human
soul
on
these
not
on
nature
he
put
his
stress
browning
paramount
interest
in
human
nature
is
further
illustrated
by
his
poems
on
the
various
arts
of
music
painting
and
sculpture
he
has
written
with
the
intimate
and
minute
knowledge
of
a
specialist
in
each
art
he
is
familiar
with
implements
and
materials
with
the
tricks
of
the
trade
the
talk
of
the
studios
but
after
all
the
art
as
an
art
is
of
much
less
interest
to
him
than
is
the
worker
the
process
and
even
the
completed
product
are
in
browning
view
important
only
in
so
far
as
they
reveal
or
affect
the
artist
the
musician
the
sculptor
or
some
phase
of
life
in
such
poems
as
abt
vogler
fra
lippo
lippi
andrea
del
sarto
we
are
conscious
not
so
much
of
music
and
pictures
as
of
the
secret
springs
of
failure
the
divine
despairs
and
discontents
the
aspirations
the
creative
ecstasies
of
the
men
who
wrought
in
these
realms
andrea
del
sarto
art
is
not
the
real
theme
of
the
poem
bearing
his
name
it
is
rather
his
character
of
which
his
art
is
an
expression
the
central
fact
of
the
poem
is
the
recognition
that
a
soul
morally
impoverished
can
not
even
with
perfect
technique
produce
great
work
while
even
with
faulty
technique
a
setting
of
the
soul
to
grand
issues
will
secure
transcendent
meanings
so
too
with
abt
vogler
his
music
is
not
of
the
greatest
but
our
concern
is
with
the
musician
who
through
the
completeness
of
his
spiritual
absorption
in
music
is
conducted
into
a
realm
of
experience
beyond
that
of
speech
or
even
of
articulate
thought
another
distinctly
human
aspect
of
art
interests
browning
and
that
is
its
power
to
represent
and
so
to
recall
a
vanished
civilization
greek
statues
the
devotional
pictures
of
the
early
florentines
the
work
of
the
later
italian
realists
stand
in
old
pictures
in
florence
as
representatives
of
the
life
and
thought
that
produced
them
in
a
toccata
of
galuppi
the
music
revivifies
the
superficial
gaiety
the
undertone
of
fear
in
the
life
of
eighteenth
century
venice
highly
significant
in
this
connection
are
the
poems
in
which
he
traces
the
evolution
of
art
running
through
old
pictures
in
florence
and
fra
lippo
lippi
we
find
an
ordered
statement
of
the
chief
changes
in
the
ideals
of
art
as
browning
saw
them
the
greeks
we
are
told
had
produced
in
sculpture
the
most
beautiful
representations
of
the
human
body
but
if
their
successors
had
been
content
merely
to
admire
this
perfect
achievement
they
would
have
purchased
satisfaction
at
the
price
of
their
own
arrested
development
progress
came
only
when
in
the
dawn
of
italian
art
men
turned
from
greek
perfection
from
the
supremely
beautiful
but
limited
representations
of
the
human
body
to
an
attempt
to
paint
the
invisible
the
spiritual
side
of
man
nature
the
work
of
these
artists
was
great
because
it
was
not
imitative
and
because
it
stretched
toward
an
unending
and
ideal
future
but
the
idealistic
and
aspiring
temper
of
early
tuscan
art
had
the
defects
of
its
qualities
its
spiritual
ecstasy
once
conventionalized
and
reduced
to
a
formula
led
to
unreality
and
if
not
to
untruth
at
least
to
an
unwholesome
ignoring
of
a
part
of
truth
there
was
therefore
an
inevitable
reaction
to
the
naturalism
described
with
such
verve
and
gusto
by
fra
lippo
lippi
but
this
is
after
all
social
history
in
terms
of
art
and
to
browning
what
has
happened
in
painting
is
of
value
chiefly
as
showing
concretely
what
has
happened
in
the
mind
of
man
from
the
instances
already
cited
it
is
apparent
that
browning
interest
centered
not
in
abstract
or
theoretical
discussions
of
human
problems
but
in
the
individuals
who
face
the
problems
in
this
point
browning
is
sharply
distinguished
from
his
poetic
contemporaries
as
a
class
they
felt
deeply
all
the
weary
weight
of
this
unintelligible
world
so
deeply
that
while
they
gave
much
thought
to
ideals
of
social
amelioration
few
of
them
presented
individuals
with
any
dramatic
distinctness
browning
stands
practically
by
himself
in
the
nineteenth
century
as
the
poet
who
gives
us
both
the
doubter
and
the
doubt
who
is
able
to
join
with
an
impressive
statement
of
the
hopes
and
fears
of
man
an
equally
impressive
sequence
of
individual
men
and
women
in
this
he
harks
back
to
the
broad
inclusiveness
of
the
elizabethan
dramatists
in
contemporary
literature
his
nearest
congeners
are
in
fiction
not
in
poetry
the
great
number
and
variety
of
browning
characters
can
be
illustrated
in
different
ways
we
might
for
instance
note
how
many
nationalities
are
represented
the
personages
in
stafford
and
the
cavalier
tunes
are
englishmen
from
the
time
of
the
civil
war
clive
is
a
true
story
of
the
indian
empire
we
have
from
italian
life
the
numerous
characters
in
fra
lippo
lippi
pictor
ignotus
the
bishop
orders
his
tomb
at
praxed
church
my
last
duchess
ring
and
the
a
grammarian
funeral
up
at
a
villa
down
in
the
city
in
a
gondola
and
many
more
count
gismond
and
hervé
riel
are
french
stories
and
abt
vogler
are
of
german
origin
pheidippides
and
echetlos
celebrate
greek
thought
and
adventure
very
important
poems
such
as
saul
and
rabbi
ben
ezra
have
to
do
with
jewish
life
and
unlike
shakespeare
who
is
not
concerned
with
making
julius
cæsar
a
roman
or
duke
theseus
a
greek
browning
brings
to
the
creation
of
each
of
these
widely
divergent
characters
a
detailed
knowledge
of
the
special
habits
of
life
and
thought
of
the
nation
or
race
concerned
he
represents
also
many
kinds
of
human
interest
we
find
in
his
poems
seekers
after
knowledge
such
as
paracelsus
who
takes
all
thought
and
fact
as
his
domain
or
such
as
the
grammarian
who
found
greek
particles
too
wide
a
realm
or
such
as
the
pedant
sibrandus
schafnaburgensis
whose
learned
rubbish
cumbers
the
land
there
are
likewise
those
who
grope
after
the
truths
of
religion
from
caliban
on
his
island
to
the
learned
physician
karshish
and
the
highly
cultured
cleon
those
who
have
the
full
vision
from
john
to
rabbi
ben
ezra
those
who
juggle
with
terms
and
creeds
as
does
bishop
blougram
and
out
and
out
frauds
like
sludge
the
medium
the
church
is
represented
by
many
men
dissimilar
in
endowments
tastes
spiritual
experiences
and
aims
there
are
italian
prelates
of
every
sort
from
the
bishop
of
praxed
occupied
in
death
with
vain
thoughts
of
and
pure
latin
to
the
caponsacchi
who
saved
pompilia
and
the
wise
old
pope
who
pronounced
guido
doom
from
the
unworthy
priest
in
the
spanish
cloister
to
the
very
human
kindly
pope
in
the
bean
feast
and
from
all
these
it
is
far
down
the
ages
to
the
evangelical
parish
priest
of
inn
that
purblind
honest
drudge
who
the
deeper
to
impress
his
flock
painted
heaven
dimly
but
made
hell
distinct
there
are
many
artists
many
musicians
there
are
poets
from
aprile
in
and
the
troubadours
eglamour
and
sordello
to
keats
and
shelley
the
extremes
of
social
life
are
given
there
are
the
in
and
there
are
kings
and
queens
with
royal
retinues
there
are
statesmen
and
warriors
and
seekers
after
romantic
adventure
there
are
haughty
aristocrats
of
cold
and
cruel
natures
and
there
are
obscure
but
doers
of
heroic
deeds
dictum
study
man
man
whatever
the
issue
led
him
into
a
world
wider
than
that
known
by
any
other
poet
of
his
time
and
akin
as
has
been
pointed
out
to
that
of
the
great
writers
of
fiction
as
an
observer
of
human
life
he
was
not
unlike
his
poor
poet
of
valladolid
who
with
his
scrutinizing
hat
went
about
the
streets
absorbed
in
watching
all
kinds
of
people
all
sorts
of
occupations
scenting
the
world
looking
it
full
in
the
face
he
chose
to
set
forth
the
wants
and
ways
of
actual
life
he
summed
up
his
work
in
the
epilogue
to
pacchiarotto
man
thoughts
and
loves
and
hates
earth
is
my
vineyard
these
grew
there
from
grape
of
the
ground
i
made
or
marred
my
vintage
it
is
further
apparent
that
browning
characters
are
never
merely
types
but
must
always
be
reckoned
with
as
individuals
it
was
his
belief
that
no
two
beings
were
ever
made
similar
in
head
and
heart
hence
even
where
there
are
external
similarities
the
essential
elements
are
strongly
differentiated
take
for
instance
three
poems
in
which
the
situations
are
not
unlike
in
my
last
duchess
the
flight
of
the
duchess
and
ring
and
the
we
have
a
portrayal
of
three
men
of
high
lineage
but
cold
egotistic
cruel
who
have
married
very
young
and
lovely
women
over
whom
the
custom
of
the
times
gives
them
absolute
power
but
there
the
likeness
ends
we
can
not
for
a
moment
class
together
the
polished
aesthetic
aristocrat
of
the
first
poem
the
absurd
little
popinjay
of
the
second
and
the
of
the
third
less
strongly
but
as
clearly
are
the
wives
differentiated
to
the
innocent
gaiety
of
heart
the
bright
sweet
friendliness
of
the
hapless
lady
in
my
last
duchess
must
be
added
for
the
lady
in
the
flight
of
the
duchess
a
native
force
of
character
which
when
roused
by
the
call
of
the
enables
her
to
break
the
yoke
imposed
on
her
by
the
duke
and
his
mother
and
go
forth
into
a
life
of
adventure
freedom
and
love
the
delicate
pompilia
in
ring
and
the
has
also
power
to
initiate
and
carry
through
a
plan
of
escape
but
her
incentive
is
no
call
to
romantic
freedom
her
passive
endurance
changes
to
active
revolt
only
when
motive
and
energy
are
supplied
by
her
love
for
her
child
or
take
pippa
and
phene
in
two
beautiful
young
girls
brought
up
in
dangerous
and
evil
surroundings
but
both
innately
pure
in
character
and
experience
they
are
however
as
unlike
as
two
girls
could
be
phene
undeveloped
in
mind
and
heart
the
easily
duped
agent
of
a
cruel
trick
appeals
to
us
by
her
slow
incredulous
but
eager
response
to
goodness
and
aspiration
the
tremulous
opening
of
her
soul
to
love
but
pippa
with
her
observant
love
of
nature
her
gay
sportive
winsome
fancies
her
imaginative
sympathy
with
the
lives
of
others
her
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
her
poise
her
bright
steadiness
of
soul
carries
us
into
a
different
and
much
more
highly
evolved
world
of
thought
and
feeling
so
we
might
go
through
the
great
assemblage
of
browning
characters
to
find
that
each
one
stands
out
by
himself
as
a
person
with
his
own
qualities
possibilities
and
problems
in
all
this
portrayal
of
individuals
the
emphasis
is
on
things
of
the
mind
and
heart
in
these
realms
browning
found
nothing
alien
or
uninteresting
from
point
to
point
his
poetry
illustrates
what
he
said
in
his
comment
on
my
stress
lay
on
the
incidents
in
the
development
of
a
human
soul
little
else
is
worth
study
in
all
his
poetry
environment
is
of
importance
only
in
so
far
as
it
is
the
stuff
on
which
the
soul
works
it
is
the
subtle
thing
called
spirit
it
is
the
soul
world
to
which
he
devotes
himself
it
is
only
from
a
study
of
browning
many
characters
that
we
may
arrive
at
a
statement
of
some
of
the
distinguishing
features
of
his
philosophy
of
life
and
any
such
statements
must
be
made
with
extreme
caution
because
of
his
dramatic
method
he
utters
this
caution
himself
when
he
says
of
his
poems
their
contents
are
always
dramatic
in
principle
and
so
many
utterances
of
so
many
imaginary
people
yet
it
is
possible
by
taking
the
general
trend
and
scope
of
his
work
to
make
justifiable
deductions
concerning
the
dominant
ideas
in
the
rich
field
of
his
poetry
and
drama
in
browning
philosophy
of
life
words
of
especial
significance
are
growth
and
progress
domizia
in
says
how
inexhaustibly
the
spirit
grows
one
object
she
seemed
erewhile
born
to
reach
with
her
whole
energies
and
die
content
so
like
a
wall
at
the
world
edge
is
stood
with
naught
beyond
to
live
for
is
that
reached
already
are
new
undreamed
energies
outgrowing
under
and
extending
farther
to
a
new
object
so
too
john
in
a
death
in
the
desert
sums
up
his
belief
in
the
line
i
say
that
man
was
made
to
grow
not
stop
growth
here
and
growth
hereafter
are
the
essential
elements
of
browning
creed
and
there
is
no
other
poet
in
whom
all
kinds
of
thinking
and
doing
are
so
uniformly
tested
by
their
outcome
in
the
growth
of
the
soul
does
joy
stimulate
to
fuller
life
does
suffering
bring
out
moral
qualities
do
obstacles
develop
energy
do
sharp
temptations
become
a
source
of
strength
and
assured
soldiership
does
knowledge
of
evil
lead
to
a
new
exaltation
of
good
does
sin
lead
to
and
so
to
regeneration
then
all
these
are
ministers
of
grace
for
through
them
the
soul
has
reached
greater
heights
and
fuller
life
whatever
bids
the
soul
nor
stand
nor
sit
but
go
is
to
be
welcomed
the
cost
of
this
growth
may
be
great
but
the
advances
of
spirit
are
represented
as
worth
any
sacrifice
the
lady
in
the
flight
of
the
duchess
goes
from
splendor
and
ease
to
hardship
and
obscurity
but
she
wins
freedom
of
thought
and
of
act
and
the
opportunity
to
test
the
qualities
of
her
soul
in
sebald
might
have
had
love
and
wealth
jules
might
have
attained
fame
along
the
conventional
path
marked
out
for
him
by
the
monsignor
luigi
had
the
prospect
of
an
easy
life
and
happy
love
the
monsignor
might
have
had
enhanced
honor
from
the
church
into
whose
coffers
he
could
have
turned
great
revenues
but
instead
each
responds
in
turn
to
pippa
songs
sebald
gains
a
true
view
of
sin
jules
gets
a
new
conception
of
service
and
attainment
wavering
purpose
of
for
his
country
good
is
strengthened
the
monsignor
is
held
back
from
connivance
at
a
crime
in
all
these
cases
the
external
loss
is
as
nothing
compared
to
the
gain
in
spiritual
knowledge
and
energy
contact
with
magnetic
and
superior
personalities
is
a
way
of
growth
particularly
noted
by
browning
there
are
men
he
says
who
bring
new
feeling
fresh
from
god
and
whose
life
reteaches
us
what
life
should
be
what
faith
is
loyalty
and
simpleness
pompilia
says
of
caponsacchi
through
such
souls
alone
god
stooping
shows
sufficient
of
his
light
for
us
i
the
dark
to
rise
by
the
highest
souls
are
seers
in
the
noblest
sense
and
they
impart
the
gift
of
seeing
to
the
rest
but
the
helpful
personality
need
not
be
great
in
knowledge
or
rank
in
pippa
browning
emphasizes
the
power
of
unconscious
goodness
in
clarifying
the
spiritual
vision
of
others
and
in
thus
stimulating
to
right
action
and
in
david
he
shows
the
power
of
poetic
charm
innocence
and
eager
love
to
drive
away
from
another
heart
a
mood
of
black
despair
but
outside
influences
are
after
all
says
browning
of
secondary
importance
they
can
at
best
do
no
more
than
stimulate
and
guide
when
andrea
del
sarto
attributes
his
general
lowering
of
ideals
and
power
to
the
influence
of
lucrezia
he
evades
the
real
issue
incentives
must
come
from
the
soul
self
growth
is
dependent
on
personal
struggle
man
is
by
his
very
nature
forced
to
try
and
make
else
fail
to
grow
formed
to
rise
reach
at
if
not
grasp
and
gain
the
good
beyond
him
which
attempt
is
growth
so
also
is
it
better
that
youth
should
strive
through
acts
uncouth
toward
making
than
repose
on
aught
found
made
it
is
in
the
independence
and
originality
of
such
striving
that
the
soul
discovers
and
frees
its
innate
potentialities
an
inevitable
corollary
of
this
idea
of
progress
is
the
emphasis
put
upon
aspiration
as
a
habit
of
the
mind
the
pursuit
of
an
ideal
a
divine
discontent
with
present
accomplishment
are
enjoined
upon
man
the
gleams
of
heaven
on
earth
are
not
meant
to
be
permanent
or
satisfying
but
only
to
sting
man
into
hunger
for
full
light
when
a
human
being
has
achieved
to
the
full
extent
of
his
perceptions
or
aspirations
he
has
thinks
browning
met
with
the
greatest
possible
disaster
that
of
arrested
development
man
powers
should
ever
climb
new
heights
for
his
soul
health
he
should
always
see
a
flying
point
of
bliss
remote
a
happiness
in
store
afar
a
sphere
of
distant
glory
a
man
reach
should
exceed
his
grasp
or
what
a
heaven
for
according
to
this
ideal
man
conception
of
good
is
ever
changing
and
ever
widening
and
hence
never
in
this
life
to
be
fully
attained
yet
the
condition
of
growth
is
that
he
have
an
unmeasured
thirst
for
good
and
that
he
pursue
it
with
unquenchable
ardor
the
importance
of
love
as
one
of
the
most
effective
agencies
in
spiritual
growth
is
stated
and
restated
in
browning
poetry
and
by
exceedingly
diverse
characters
the
queen
in
a
turns
away
from
her
lonely
splendor
to
exclaim
there
is
no
good
of
life
but
love
but
love
what
else
looks
good
is
some
shade
flung
from
love
love
gilds
it
gives
it
worth
the
duchess
learns
from
the
gypsy
how
love
is
the
only
good
in
the
world
the
famous
singer
in
dis
aliter
visum
knows
that
art
verse
music
count
as
naught
beside
love
found
gained
and
kept
browning
seems
to
regard
almost
any
genuine
love
as
a
means
of
opening
out
the
nature
to
fuller
to
wider
sympathies
and
to
increased
power
of
action
hence
he
condemns
all
cautious
calculation
of
obstacles
all
dwelling
upon
conventional
difficulties
in
the
path
of
those
who
have
clearly
seen
the
hence
even
love
unrequited
is
counted
of
inestimable
value
in
valence
says
is
the
knowledge
of
her
naught
the
memory
naught
lady
should
such
an
one
have
looked
on
you
wrong
yourself
so
far
as
quote
the
world
and
say
love
can
go
unrequited
here
you
will
have
blessed
him
to
his
whole
life
end
low
passions
hindered
baser
cares
kept
back
all
goodness
cherished
where
you
dwelt
and
dwell
but
the
love
of
man
and
woman
is
not
the
only
sort
a
part
of
the
value
of
this
individual
relationship
is
that
it
may
be
regarded
as
a
revelation
and
symbol
of
the
spirit
of
sympathy
whereby
mankind
should
be
ruled
when
paracelsus
analyzes
his
life
he
ascribes
his
failure
to
the
fact
that
he
has
sought
knowledge
to
the
exclusion
of
all
else
he
finally
came
to
see
that
knowledge
however
profound
is
of
itself
barren
of
satisfaction
he
had
meant
to
serve
men
by
revealing
truth
to
them
but
he
found
that
real
service
is
based
on
the
understanding
given
by
love
in
self
condemnation
he
says
in
my
own
heart
love
had
not
been
made
wise
to
trace
love
faint
beginnings
in
mankind
to
know
even
hate
is
but
a
mask
of
love
to
see
a
good
in
evil
and
a
hope
in
to
sympathize
be
proud
of
their
faint
aspirings
dim
struggles
for
truth
their
poorest
fallacies
their
prejudice
and
fears
and
cares
and
doubts
all
with
a
touch
of
nobleness
despite
their
error
upward
tending
all
though
weak
browning
conception
of
the
function
and
power
of
love
is
based
on
his
belief
in
its
divine
origin
twice
at
least
in
easter
day
and
saul
his
characters
work
out
from
an
overpowering
recognition
of
omniscience
and
omnipotence
to
a
final
recognition
that
his
love
is
equal
in
scope
with
his
power
and
knowledge
and
he
counts
human
service
as
most
complete
when
as
in
david
before
saul
it
reaches
out
to
love
and
recruits
its
failing
forces
from
the
divine
source
underlying
browning
doctrine
of
the
value
of
love
and
his
doctrine
of
progress
and
aspiration
is
his
belief
in
personal
immortality
when
he
was
charged
with
being
strongly
against
darwin
with
rejecting
the
truths
of
science
and
regretting
its
advance
he
answered
that
the
idea
of
a
progressive
development
from
senseless
matter
until
appearance
had
been
a
familiar
conception
to
him
from
the
beginning
but
he
reiterated
his
constant
faith
in
creative
intelligence
acting
on
matter
but
not
resulting
from
it
soul
he
said
is
not
matter
nor
from
matter
but
above
two
assumptions
which
though
not
susceptible
of
proof
he
regards
as
inescapable
are
the
existence
of
creative
intelligence
and
of
the
subtle
thing
called
spirit
when
he
argues
out
the
question
of
the
immortality
of
this
spirit
as
in
he
admits
the
subjective
character
of
the
evidence
but
when
he
speaks
spontaneously
out
of
his
own
feeling
or
experience
it
is
with
positive
belief
in
life
after
death
to
sharp
he
said
death
death
it
is
this
harping
on
death
that
i
do
despise
so
much
why
you
know
as
well
as
i
that
death
is
life
just
as
our
daily
our
momentarily
dying
body
is
none
the
less
alive
and
ever
recruiting
new
forces
of
existence
without
death
which
is
our
word
for
change
for
growth
there
could
be
no
prolongation
of
what
we
call
life
pshaw
it
is
foolish
to
argue
upon
such
a
thing
even
for
myself
i
deny
death
as
an
end
of
everything
never
say
of
me
that
i
am
dead
when
his
wife
died
he
wrote
in
her
testament
these
words
from
dante
thus
i
believe
thus
i
affirm
thus
i
am
certain
it
is
that
from
this
life
i
shall
pass
to
another
better
there
where
that
lady
lives
of
whom
my
soul
was
enamored
this
faith
in
life
after
death
explains
much
of
browning
philosophy
the
source
of
the
pagan
cleon
profound
discouragement
was
the
fact
that
man
should
be
dowered
with
should
be
given
the
ability
to
perceive
and
comprehend
splendor
and
breadth
of
experience
but
should
through
the
straitness
of
human
limitations
be
held
back
from
satisfaction
and
achievement
and
should
be
left
to
die
thus
dazzled
thus
baffled
the
secret
of
browning
optimism
on
the
other
hand
is
his
belief
that
in
heaven
the
soul
is
freed
from
limitations
and
blossoms
out
into
capabilities
of
joy
and
of
activity
beyond
anything
suggested
by
the
most
golden
dreams
of
earth
to
him
all
life
is
a
unit
beginning
here
and
destined
to
unimaginable
development
hereafter
earth
is
regarded
as
a
place
of
tutelage
where
man
may
learn
to
set
foot
on
some
one
path
to
heaven
and
no
work
begun
here
shall
ever
pause
for
death
even
apparent
failure
here
counts
for
little
so
the
quest
be
not
abandoned
each
of
us
may
as
abt
vogler
look
without
despair
on
the
broken
arcs
of
earth
if
his
faith
reveals
the
perfect
round
in
heaven
from
any
prolonged
study
of
browning
poetry
we
become
conscious
of
certain
dominant
qualities
of
style
that
may
be
thought
of
quite
apart
from
his
themes
or
message
that
his
style
has
the
defect
of
its
qualities
has
already
been
pointed
out
here
we
may
appropriately
indicate
those
qualities
as
positive
elements
of
his
power
his
diction
rich
alike
in
the
most
learned
words
and
the
most
colloquial
is
responsive
to
all
demands
his
power
of
phrasing
runs
the
whole
gamut
from
the
most
pellucid
simplicity
to
the
most
triumphant
originality
his
figures
of
speech
drawn
from
all
realms
are
penetrating
in
quality
of
startling
aptness
equally
characteristic
is
his
versification
varying
as
it
does
from
passages
of
melodic
smoothness
and
grace
to
lines
as
strident
broken
and
harsh
as
the
thought
they
dramatically
reflect
in
narration
whether
in
the
brilliant
rapidity
and
ease
of
a
short
poem
like
hervé
riel
or
in
the
sustained
flow
of
a
long
story
like
that
of
pompilia
we
find
unusual
skill
in
disquisition
in
the
presentation
of
complicated
and
elusive
intellectual
processes
there
is
a
quite
unmatched
agility
and
dexterity
probably
no
two
forms
of
poetry
contain
more
of
most
noteworthy
work
than
the
lyric
especially
the
reflective
love
lyric
and
that
form
which
is
distinctively
his
own
the
dramatic
monologue
in
his
best
poems
in
this
last
form
he
has
no
competitor
it
is
in
the
presentation
of
character
through
the
medium
of
dramatic
monologue
that
he
most
fully
reveals
the
unerring
precision
of
his
analysis
his
lightning
glance
into
the
heart
of
a
mystery
the
ease
with
which
he
tracks
a
motive
or
mood
or
thought
to
its
last
hiding
place
and
his
consequent
passion
and
fire
of
sympathy
or
scorn
finally
whether
we
consider
browning
style
or
subject
matter
or
philosophy
of
life
we
become
growingly
conscious
of
his
force
the
clear
virgilian
line
of
tennyson
is
the
outcome
of
a
nature
instinctively
aristocratic
and
aloof
browning
is
out
in
the
thick
of
the
fight
and
almost
vociferously
demands
a
hearing
whatever
makes
his
thought
clear
vivid
active
forcible
seems
to
him
however
prosaic
it
may
appear
at
first
glance
proper
poetic
material
the
immediate
effect
of
his
verse
is
the
rousing
of
the
mind
to
great
issues
his
tremendous
sincerity
results
in
a
dispelling
of
mists
a
stripping
off
of
husks
his
demand
for
the
truth
is
a
trumpet
note
of
challenge
to
our
doubt
or
fear
or
indifference
his
penetrating
study
of
human
problems
leads
to
an
inevitable
widening
of
the
horizon
of
comprehension
and
sympathy
on
the
part
of
his
readers
and
his
courage
and
optimism
constitute
an
inspiration
and
stimulus
of
an
uncommonly
virile
sort
it
has
been
said
that
browning
is
not
a
poet
but
a
literature
and
in
work
so
vast
and
varied
that
it
can
be
thus
characterized
there
must
be
wide
extremes
of
value
it
is
almost
certain
that
portions
of
his
work
can
not
live
they
are
too
difficult
too
unliterary
but
in
the
portions
where
great
thought
finds
adequate
form
the
product
is
a
priceless
gift
and
one
not
equaled
by
any
other
poet
of
his
age

and
with
light
and
perfume
music
too
so
the
stars
wheeled
round
and
the
darkness
passed
and
at
morn
we
started
beside
the
mast
and
still
each
ship
was
sailing
fast
now
one
morn
land
appeared
a
speck
dim
trembling
betwixt
sea
and
sky
avoid
it
cried
our
pilot
check
the
shout
restrain
the
eager
eye
but
the
heaving
sea
was
black
behind
for
many
a
night
and
many
a
day
and
land
though
but
a
rock
drew
nigh
so
we
broke
the
cedar
pales
away
let
the
purple
awning
flap
in
the
wind
and
a
statue
bright
was
on
every
deck
we
shouted
every
man
of
us
and
steered
right
into
the
harbor
thus
with
pomp
and
pæan
glorious
a
hundred
shapes
of
lucid
stone
all
day
we
built
its
shrine
for
each
a
shrine
of
rock
for
everyone
nor
paused
till
in
the
westering
sun
we
sat
together
on
the
beach
to
sing
because
our
task
was
done
when
lo
what
shouts
and
merry
songs
what
laughter
all
the
distance
stirs
a
loaded
raft
with
happy
throngs
of
gentle
islanders
our
isles
are
just
at
hand
they
cried
like
cloudlets
faint
in
even
sleeping
our
are
opened
wide
our
thick
shade
are
keeping
for
these
majestic
forms
they
cried
oh
then
we
awoke
with
sudden
start
from
our
deep
dream
and
knew
too
late
how
bare
the
rock
how
desolate
which
had
received
our
precious
freight
yet
we
called
out
depart
our
gifts
once
given
must
here
abide
our
work
is
done
we
have
no
heart
to
mar
our
work
we
cried
iii
thus
the
mayne
glideth
thus
the
mayne
glideth
where
my
love
abideth
sleep
no
softer
it
proceeds
on
through
lawns
on
through
meads
on
and
on
befall
meandering
and
musical
though
the
niggard
pasturage
bears
not
on
its
shaven
ledge
aught
but
weeds
and
waving
grasses
to
view
the
river
as
it
passes
save
here
and
there
a
scanty
patch
of
primroses
too
faint
to
catch
a
weary
bee
and
scarce
it
pushes
its
gentle
way
through
strangling
rushes
where
the
glossy
kingfisher
flutters
when
are
near
glad
the
shelving
banks
to
shun
red
and
steaming
in
the
sun
where
the
with
pale
throat
burrows
and
the
speckled
stoat
where
the
quick
sandpipers
flit
in
and
out
the
marl
and
grit
that
seems
to
breed
them
brown
as
they
naught
disturbs
its
quiet
way
save
some
lazy
stork
that
springs
trailing
it
with
legs

shut
the

the

sank
to

and
into
the
midnight
we
galloped
abreast
not

we
kept
the
great
pace
neck
by
neck
stride
by
stride
never
changing
our

turned
in

and
made
its

shortened

and

the
chained

the

nor

steadily
roland
a
whit
was
moonset
at
starting
but
while
we
drew
near
lokeren
the
cocks
crew
and
twilight
dawned
clear
at
boom
a
great
yellow
star
came
out
to
see
at
düffeld
was
morning
as
plain
as
could
be
and
from
mecheln
we
heard
the
so
joris
broke
silence
with
yet
there
is
time
at
aershot
up
leaped
of
a
sudden
the
sun
and
against
him
the
cattle
stood
black
every
one
to
stare
through
the
mist
at
us
galloping
past
and
i
saw
my
stout
galloper
roland
at
last
with
resolute
shoulders
each
butting
away
the
haze
as
some
bluff
river
headland
its
spray
and
his
low
head
and
crest
just
one
sharp
ear
bent
back
for
my
voice
and
the
other
pricked
out
on
his
track
and
one
eye
black
intelligence
ever
that
glance
its
white
edge
at
me
his
own
master
askance
and
the
thick
heavy
which
aye
and
anon
his
fierce
lips
shook
upwards
in
galloping
on
by
hasselt
dirck
groaned
and
cried
joris
stay
spur
your
roos
galloped
bravely
the
fault
not
in
her
we
remember
at
aix
for
one
heard
the
quick
wheeze
of
her
chest
saw
the
stretched
neck
and
staggering
knees
and
sunk
tail
and
horrible
heave
of
the
flank
as
down
on
her
haunches
she
shuddered
and
sank
so
we
were
left
galloping
joris
and
i
past
looz
and
past
tongres
no
cloud
in
the
sky
the
broad
sun
above
laughed
a
pitiless
laugh
our
feet
broke
the
brittle
bright
stubble
like
chaff
till
over
by
dalhem
a
sprang
white
and
gallop
gasped
joris
for
aix
is
in
sight
how
they
greet
us
and
all
in
a
moment
his
roan
rolled
neck
and
croup
over
lay
dead
as
a
stone
and
there
was
my
roland
to
bear
the
whole
weight
of
the
news
which
alone
could
save
aix
from
her
fate
with
his
nostrils
like
pits
full
of
blood
to
the
brim
and
with
circles
of
red
for
his
rim
then
i
cast
loose
my
buffcoat
each
holster
let
fall
shook
off
both
my
let
go
belt
and
all
stood
up
in
the
stirrup
leaned
patted
his
ear
called
my
roland
his
my
horse
without
peer
clapped
my
hands
laughed
and
sang
any
noise
bad
or
good
till
at
length
into
aix
roland
galloped
and
stood
and
all
i
remember
is
friends
flocking
round
as
i
sat
with
his
head
my
knees
on
the
ground
and
no
voice
but
was
praising
this
roland
of
mine
as
i
poured
down
his
throat
our
last
measure
of
wine
which
the
burgesses
voted
by
common
consent
was
no
more
than
his
due
who
brought
good
news
from
ghent
garden
fancies
the
flower
name
here
the
garden
she
walked
across
arm
in
my
arm
such
a
short
while
since
hark
now
i
push
its
wicket
the
moss
hinders
the
hinges
and
makes
them
wince
she
must
have
reached
this
shrub
ere
she
turned
as
back
with
that
murmur
the
wicket
swung
for
she
laid
the
poor
snail
my
chance
foot
spurned
to
feed
and
forget
it
the
leaves
among
down
this
side
of
the
she
went
while
her
robe
edge
brushed
the
box
and
here
she
paused
in
her
gracious
talk
to
point
me
a
moth
on
the
phlox
roses
ranged
in
valiant
row
i
will
never
think
that
she
passed
you
by
she
loves
you
noble
roses
i
know
but
yonder
see
where
the
lie
this
flower
she
stopped
at
finger
on
lip
stooped
over
in
doubt
as
settling
its
claim
till
she
gave
me
with
pride
to
make
no
slip
its
soft
meandering
spanish
name
what
a
name
was
it
love
or
praise
speech
or
song
i
must
learn
spanish
one
of
these
days
only
for
that
slow
sweet
name
sake
roses
if
i
live
and
do
well
i
may
bring
her
one
of
these
days
to
fix
you
fast
with
as
fine
a
spell
fit
you
each
with
his
spanish
phrase
but
do
not
detain
me
now
for
she
lingers
there
like
sunshine
over
the
ground
and
ever
i
see
her
soft
white
fingers
searching
after
the
bud
she
found
flower
you
spaniard
look
that
you
grow
not
stay
as
you
are
and
be
loved
forever
bud
if
i
kiss
you
is
that
you
blow
not
mind
the
shut
pink
month
opens
never
for
while
it
pouts
her
fingers
wrestle
twinkling
the
audacious
leaves
between
till
round
they
turn
and
down
they
nestle
is
not
the
dear
mark
still
to
be
seen
where
i
find
her
not
beauties
vanish
whither
i
follow
her
beauties
flee
is
there
no
method
to
tell
her
in
spanish
june
twice
june
since
she
breathed
it
with
me
come
bud
show
me
the
least
of
her
traces
treasure
my
lady
lightest
footfall
ah
you
may
flout
and
turn
up
your
faces
roses
you
are
not
so
fair
after
all
meeting
at
night
the
gray
sea
and
the
long
black
land
and
the
yellow
large
and
low
and
the
startled
little
waves
that
leap
in
fiery
ringlets
from
their
sleep
as
i
gain
the
cove
with
pushing
prow
and
quench
its
speed
i
the
slushy
sand
then
a
mile
of
warm
beach
three
fields
to
cross
till
a
farm
appears
a
tap
at
the
pane
the
quick
sharp
scratch
and
blue
spurt
of
a
lighted
match
and
a
voice
less
loud
through
its
joys
and
fears
than
the
two
hearts
beating
each
to
each
parting
at
morning
round
the
cape
of
a
sudden
came
the
sea
and
the
sun
looked
over
the
mountain
rim
and
straight
was
a
path
of
gold
for
him
and
the
need
of
a
world
of
men
for
me
evelyn
hope
beautiful
evelyn
hope
is
dead
sit
and
watch
by
her
side
an
hour
that
is
her
this
her
bed
she
plucked
that
piece
of
beginning
to
die
too
in
the
glass
little
has
yet
been
changed
i
think
the
shutters
are
shut
no
light
may
pass
save
two
long
rays
through
the
hinge
chink
sixteen
years
old
when
she
died
perhaps
she
had
scarcely
heard
my
name
it
was
not
her
time
to
love
beside
her
life
had
many
a
hope
and
aim
duties
enough
and
little
cares
and
now
was
quiet
now
astir
till
god
hand
beckoned
unawares
and
the
sweet
white
brow
is
all
of
her
is
it
too
late
then
evelyn
hope
what
your
soul
was
pure
and
true
the
good
stars
met
in
your
horoscope
made
you
of
spirit
fire
and
dew
and
just
because
i
was
thrice
as
old
and
our
paths
in
the
world
diverged
so
wide
each
was
naught
to
each
must
i
be
told
we
were
fellow
mortals
naught
beside
no
indeed
for
god
above
is
great
to
grant
as
mighty
to
make
and
creates
the
love
to
reward
the
love
i
claim
you
still
for
my
own
love
sake
delayed
it
may
be
for
more
lives
yet
through
worlds
i
shall
traverse
not
a
few
much
is
to
learn
much
to
forget
ere
the
time
be
come
for
taking
you
but
the
time
will
come
at
last
it
will
when
evelyn
hope
what
meant
i
shall
say
in
the
lower
earth
in
the
years
long
still
that
body
and
soul
so
pure
and
gay
why
your
hair
was
amber
i
shall
divine
and
your
mouth
of
your
own
geranium
red
and
what
you
would
do
with
me
in
fine
in
the
new
life
come
in
the
old
one
stead
i
have
lived
i
shall
say
so
much
since
then
given
up
myself
so
many
times
gained
me
the
gains
of
various
men
ransacked
the
ages
spoiled
the
climes
yet
one
thing
one
in
my
soul
full
scope
either
i
missed
or
itself
missed
me
and
i
want
and
find
you
evelyn
hope
what
is
the
issue
let
us
see
i
loved
you
evelyn
all
the
while
my
heart
seemed
full
as
it
could
hold
there
was
place
and
to
spare
for
the
frank
young
smile
and
the
red
young
mouth
and
the
hair
young
gold
so
hush
i
will
give
you
this
leaf
to
keep
see
i
shut
it
inside
the
sweet
cold
hand
there
that
is
our
secret
go
to
sleep
you
will
wake
and
remember
and
understand
love
among
the
ruins
where
the
end
of
evening
smiles
miles
and
miles
on
the
solitary
pastures
where
our
sheep
tinkle
homeward
through
the
twilight
stray
or
stop
as
they
crop
was
the
site
once
of
a
city
great
and
gay
so
they
say
of
our
country
very
capital
its
prince
ages
since
held
his
court
in
gathered
councils
wielding
far
peace
or
war
now
the
country
does
not
even
boast
a
tree
as
you
see
to
distinguish
slopes
of
verdure
certain
rills
from
the
hills
intersect
and
give
a
name
to
else
they
run
into
one
where
the
domed
and
daring
palace
shot
its
spires
up
like
fires
the
circuit
of
a
wall
bounding
all
made
of
marble
men
might
march
on
nor
be
pressed
twelve
abreast
and
such
plenty
and
perfection
see
of
grass
never
was
such
a
carpet
as
this
and
embeds
every
vestige
of
the
city
guessed
alone
stock
or
stone
where
a
multitude
of
men
breathed
joy
and
woe
long
ago
lust
of
glory
pricked
their
hearts
up
dread
of
shame
struck
them
tame
and
that
glory
and
that
shame
alike
the
gold
bought
and
sold
now
the
single
little
turret
that
remains
on
the
plains
by
the
caper
overrooted
by
the
gourd
overscored
while
the
patching
houseleek
head
of
blossom
winks
through
the
chinks
marks
the
basement
whence
a
tower
in
ancient
time
sprang
sublime
and
a
burning
ring
all
around
the
chariots
traced
as
they
raced
and
the
monarch
and
his
minions
and
his
dames
viewed
the
games
and
i
know
while
thus
the
eve
smiles
to
leave
to
their
folding
all
our
fleece
in
such
peace
and
the
slopes
and
rills
in
undistinguished
gray
melt
away
that
a
girl
with
eager
eyes
and
yellow
hair
waits
me
there
in
the
turret
whence
the
charioteers
caught
soul
for
the
goal
when
the
king
looked
where
she
looks
now
breathless
dumb
till
i
come
but
he
looked
upon
the
city
every
side
far
and
wide
all
the
mountains
topped
with
temples
all
the
colonnades
all
the
causeys
bridges
aqueducts
and
then
all
the
men
when
i
do
come
she
will
speak
not
she
will
stand
either
hand
on
my
shoulder
give
her
eyes
the
first
embrace
of
my
face
ere
we
rush
ere
we
extinguish
sight
and
speech
each
on
each
in
one
year
they
sent
a
million
fighters
forth
south
and
north
and
they
built
their
gods
a
brazen
pillar
high
as
the
sky
yet
reserved
a
thousand
chariots
in
full
force
gold
of
course
o
heart
o
blood
that
freezes
blood
that
burns
earth
returns
for
whole
centuries
of
folly
noise
and
sin
shut
them
in
with
their
triumphs
and
their
glories
and
the
rest
love
is
best
up
at
a
villa
down
in
the
city
as
distinguished
by
an
italian
person
of
quality
had
i
but
plenty
of
money
money
enough
and
to
spare
the
house
for
me
no
doubt
were
a
house
in
the
ah
such
a
life
such
a
life
as
one
leads
at
the
window
there
something
to
see
by
bacchus
something
to
hear
at
least
there
the
whole
day
long
one
life
is
a
perfect
feast
while
up
at
a
villa
one
lives
i
maintain
it
no
more
than
a
beast
well
now
look
at
our
villa
stuck
like
the
horn
of
a
bull
just
on
a
as
bare
as
the
creature
skull
save
a
mere
shag
of
a
bush
with
hardly
a
leaf
to
pull
i
scratch
my
own
sometimes
to
see
if
the
hair
turned
wool
but
the
city
oh
the
city
the
square
with
the
houses
why
they
are
white
as
a
curd
there
something
to
take
the
eye
houses
in
four
straight
lines
not
a
single
front
awry
you
watch
who
crosses
and
gossips
who
saunters
who
hurries
by
green
blinds
as
a
matter
of
course
to
draw
when
the
sun
gets
high
and
the
shops
with
fanciful
signs
which
are
painted
properly
what
of
a
villa
though
winter
be
over
in
march
by
rights
is
may
perhaps
ere
the
snow
shall
have
withered
well
off
the
heights
you
the
brown
plowed
land
before
where
the
oxen
steam
and
wheeze
and
the
hills
behind
by
the
faint
gray
is
it
better
in
may
i
ask
you
you
summer
all
at
once
in
a
day
he
leaps
complete
with
a
few
strong
april
suns
the
sharp
short
emerald
wheat
scarce
risen
three
fingers
well
the
wild
tulip
at
end
of
its
tube
blows
out
its
great
red
bell
like
a
thin
clear
bubble
of
blood
for
the
children
to
pick
and
sell
is
it
ever
hot
in
the
square
there
a
fountain
to
spout
and
splash
in
the
shade
it
sings
and
springs
in
the
shine
such
flash
on
the
horses
with
curling
that
prance
and
paddle
and
pash
round
the
lady
atop
in
her
conch
fifty
gazers
do
not
abash
though
all
that
she
wears
is
some
weeds
round
her
waist
in
a
sort
of
sash
all
the
year
long
at
the
villa
nothing
to
see
though
you
linger
except
yon
cypress
that
points
like
death
lean
lifted
forefinger
some
think
fireflies
pretty
when
they
mix
i
the
corn
and
mingle
or
thrid
the
stinking
hemp
till
the
stalks
of
it
seem
late
august
or
early
september
the
stunning
cicala
is
shrill
and
the
bees
keep
their
tiresome
whine
round
the
resinous
firs
on
the
hill
enough
of
the
seasons
i
spare
you
the
months
of
the
fever
and
chill
ere
you
open
your
eyes
in
the
city
the
blessed
begin
no
sooner
the
bells
leave
off
than
the
diligence
rattles
in
you
get
the
pick
of
the
news
and
it
costs
you
never
a
pin
by
and
by
there
the
traveling
doctor
gives
pills
lets
blood
draws
teeth
or
the
breaks
up
the
market
beneath
at
the
post
office
such
a
the
new
play
piping
hot
and
a
notice
how
only
this
morning
three
liberal
thieves
were
shot
above
it
behold
the
archbishop
most
fatherly
of
rebukes
and
beneath
with
his
crown
and
his
lion
some
little
new
law
of
the
duke
or
a
sonnet
with
flowery
marge
to
the
reverend
don
who
is
dante
boccaccio
petrarca
saint
jerome
and
cicero
and
moreover
the
sonnet
goes
rhyming
the
skirts
of
saint
paul
has
reached
having
preached
us
those
six
more
unctuous
than
ever
he
preached
noon
strikes
here
sweeps
the
procession
our
lady
borne
smiling
and
smart
with
a
pink
gauze
gown
all
spangles
and
seven
swords
stuck
in
her
heart
goes
the
drum
the
fife
no
keeping
one
haunches
still
it
the
greatest
pleasure
in
life
but
bless
you
it
dear
it
dear
fowls
wine
at
double
the
rate
they
have
clapped
a
new
tax
upon
salt
and
what
oil
pays
passing
the
gate
it
a
horror
to
think
of
and
so
the
villa
for
me
not
the
city
beggars
can
scarcely
be
choosers
but
still
ah
the
pity
the
pity
look
two
and
two
go
the
priests
then
the
monks
with
cowls
and
sandals
and
the
penitents
dressed
in
white
shirts
the
yellow
candles
one
he
carries
a
flag
up
straight
and
another
a
cross
with
handles
and
the
duke
guard
brings
up
the
rear
for
the
better
prevention
of
scandals
goes
the
drum
the
fife
oh
a
day
in
the
there
is
no
such
pleasure
in
life
a
toccata
of
o
galuppi
baldassare
this
is
very
sad
to
find
i
can
hardly
misconceive
you
it
would
prove
me
deaf
and
blind
but
although
i
take
your
meaning
is
with
such
a
heavy
mind
here
you
come
with
your
old
music
and
here
all
the
good
it
brings
what
they
lived
once
thus
at
venice
where
the
merchants
were
the
kings
where
saint
mark
is
where
the
doges
used
to
wed
the
sea
with
rings
aye
because
the
sea
the
street
there
and
is
arched
by
what
you
call
shylock
bridge
with
houses
on
it
where
they
kept
the
carnival
i
was
never
out
of
england
it
as
if
i
saw
it
all
did
young
people
take
their
pleasure
when
the
sea
was
warm
in
may
balls
and
masks
begun
at
midnight
burning
ever
to
when
they
made
up
fresh
adventures
for
the
morrow
do
you
say
was
a
lady
such
a
lady
cheeks
so
round
and
lips
so
red
on
her
neck
the
small
face
buoyant
like
a
on
its
bed
the
breast
superb
abundance
where
a
man
might
base
his
head
well
and
it
was
graceful
of
them
they
break
talk
off
and
afford
she
to
bite
her
mask
black
velvet
he
to
finger
on
his
sword
while
you
sat
and
played
toccatas
stately
at
the
clavichord
what
those
lesser
thirds
so
plaintive
sixths
diminished
sigh
on
sigh
told
them
something
those
suspensions
those
solutions
must
we
die
those
commiserating
sevenths
life
might
last
we
can
but
try
were
you
happy
yes
and
are
you
still
as
happy
yes
and
you
then
more
kisses
did
stop
them
when
a
million
seemed
so
few
hark
the
dominant
persistence
till
it
must
be
answered
to
so
an
octave
struck
the
answer
oh
they
praised
you
i
dare
say
brave
galuppi
that
was
music
good
alike
at
grave
and
gay
i
can
always
leave
off
talking
when
i
hear
a
master
play
then
they
left
you
for
their
pleasure
till
in
due
time
one
by
one
some
with
lives
that
came
to
nothing
some
with
deeds
as
well
undone
death
stepped
tacitly
and
took
them
where
they
never
see
the
sun
but
when
i
sit
down
to
reason
think
to
take
my
stand
nor
swerve
while
i
triumph
a
secret
wrung
from
nature
close
reserve
in
you
come
with
your
cold
music
till
i
creep
through
every
nerve
yes
you
like
a
ghostly
cricket
creaking
where
a
house
was
burned
dust
and
ashes
dead
and
done
with
venice
spent
what
venice
earned
the
soul
doubtless
is
immortal
where
a
soul
can
be
discerned
yours
for
instance
you
know
physics
something
of
geology
mathematics
are
your
pastime
souls
shall
rise
in
their
degree
butterflies
may
dread
extinction
you
not
die
it
can
not
be
as
for
venice
and
her
people
merely
born
to
bloom
and
drop
here
on
earth
they
bore
their
fruitage
mirth
and
folly
were
the
crop
what
of
soul
was
left
i
wonder
when
the
kissing
had
to
stop
dust
and
ashes
so
you
creak
it
and
i
want
the
heart
to
scold
dear
dead
women
with
such
hair
too
what
become
of
all
the
gold
used
to
hang
and
brush
their
bosoms
i
feel
chilly
and
grown
old
old
pictures
in
florence
the
morn
when
first
it
thunders
in
march
the
eel
in
the
pond
gives
a
leap
they
say
as
i
leaned
and
looked
over
the
aloed
arch
of
the
this
warm
march
day
no
flash
snapped
no
dumb
thunder
rolled
in
the
valley
beneath
where
white
and
wide
and
washed
by
the
morning
florence
lay
out
on
the
river
and
bridge
and
street
and
square
lay
mine
as
much
at
my
beck
and
call
through
the
live
translucent
bath
of
air
as
the
sights
in
a
magic
crystal
ball
and
of
all
i
saw
and
of
all
i
praised
the
most
to
praise
and
the
best
to
see
was
the
startling
giotto
raised
but
why
did
it
more
than
startle
me
giotto
how
with
that
soul
of
yours
could
you
play
me
false
who
loved
you
so
some
slights
if
a
certain
heart
endures
yet
it
feels
i
would
have
your
fellows
know
i
faith
i
perceive
not
why
i
should
care
to
break
a
silence
that
suits
them
best
but
the
thing
grows
somewhat
hard
to
bear
when
i
find
a
giotto
join
the
rest
on
the
arch
where
olives
overhead
print
the
blue
sky
with
twig
and
leaf
that
leaf
which
they
never
shed
the
aloes
i
used
to
lean
in
chief
and
mark
through
the
winter
afternoons
by
a
gift
god
grants
me
now
and
then
in
the
mild
decline
of
those
suns
like
moons
who
walked
in
florence
besides
her
men
they
might
chirp
and
chaffer
come
and
go
for
pleasure
or
profit
her
men
alive
my
business
was
hardly
with
them
i
trow
but
with
empty
cells
of
the
human
hive
with
the
the
the
church
apsis
aisle
or
nave
its
crypt
one
fingers
along
with
a
torch
its
face
set
full
for
the
sun
to
shave
wherever
a
fresco
peels
and
drops
wherever
an
outline
weakens
and
wanes
till
the
latest
life
in
the
painting
stops
stands
one
whom
each
fainter
pains
one
wishful
each
scrap
should
clutch
the
brick
each
tinge
not
wholly
escape
the
plaster
a
lion
who
dies
of
an
ass
kick
the
wronged
great
soul
of
an
ancient
master
for
oh
this
world
and
the
wrong
it
does
they
are
safe
in
heaven
with
their
backs
to
it
the
michaels
and
rafaels
you
hum
and
buzz
round
the
works
of
you
of
the
little
wit
do
their
eyes
contract
to
the
earth
old
scope
now
that
they
see
god
face
to
face
and
have
all
attained
to
be
poets
i
hope
is
their
holiday
now
in
any
case
much
they
reck
of
your
praise
and
you
but
the
wronged
great
souls
can
they
be
quit
of
a
world
where
their
work
is
all
to
do
where
you
style
them
you
of
the
little
wit
old
master
this
and
early
the
other
not
dreaming
that
old
and
new
are
fellows
a
younger
succeeds
to
an
elder
brother
da
vincis
derive
in
good
time
from
dellos
and
here
where
your
praise
might
yield
returns
and
a
handsome
word
or
two
give
help
here
after
your
kind
the
mastiff
girns
and
the
puppy
pack
of
poodles
yelp
what
not
a
word
for
stefano
there
of
brow
once
prominent
and
starry
called
nature
ape
and
the
world
despair
for
his
peerless
painting
see
vasari
there
stands
the
master
study
my
friends
what
a
man
work
comes
to
so
he
plans
it
performs
it
perfects
it
makes
amends
for
the
toiling
and
moiling
and
then
happier
the
thrifty
labor
with
upturned
eye
while
the
hand
is
busy
not
sidling
a
glance
at
the
coin
of
their
neighbor
is
looking
downward
that
makes
one
dizzy
if
you
knew
their
work
you
would
deal
your
dole
may
i
take
upon
me
to
instruct
you
when
greek
art
ran
and
reached
the
goal
thus
much
had
the
world
to
boast
the
truth
of
man
as
by
god
first
spoken
which
the
actual
generations
garble
was
and
soul
which
limbs
betoken
and
limbs
soul
informs
made
new
in
marble
so
you
saw
yourself
as
you
wished
you
were
as
you
might
have
been
as
you
can
not
be
earth
here
rebuked
by
olympus
there
and
grew
content
in
your
poor
degree
with
your
little
power
by
those
statues
godhead
and
your
little
scope
by
their
eyes
full
sway
and
your
little
grace
by
their
grace
embodied
and
your
little
date
by
their
forms
that
stay
you
would
fain
be
kinglier
say
than
i
am
even
so
you
will
not
sit
like
theseus
you
would
prove
a
model
the
son
of
priam
has
yet
the
advantage
in
arms
and
knees
use
you
wroth
can
you
slay
your
snake
like
apollo
you
grieved
still
niobe
the
grander
you
live
there
the
racers
frieze
to
follow
you
die
there
the
dying
alexander
so
testing
your
weakness
by
their
strength
your
meager
charms
by
their
rounded
beauty
measured
by
art
in
your
breadth
and
length
you
learned
to
submit
is
a
mortal
duty
when
i
say
you
is
the
common
soul
the
collective
i
mean
the
race
of
man
that
receives
life
in
parts
to
live
in
a
whole
and
grow
here
according
to
god
clear
plan
growth
came
when
looking
your
last
on
them
all
you
turned
your
eyes
inwardly
one
fine
day
and
cried
with
a
start
what
if
we
so
small
be
greater
and
grander
the
while
than
they
are
they
perfect
of
lineament
perfect
of
stature
in
both
of
such
lower
types
are
we
precisely
because
of
our
wider
nature
for
time
theirs
ours
for
eternity
today
brief
passion
limits
their
range
it
seethes
with
the
morrow
for
us
and
more
they
are
perfect
how
else
they
shall
never
change
we
are
faulty
why
not
we
have
time
in
store
the
artificer
hand
is
not
arrested
with
us
we
are
nowise
polished
they
stand
for
our
copy
and
once
invested
with
all
they
can
teach
we
shall
see
them
abolished
is
a
toil

let

exhort
you

the

the

if

you
intend

acknowledge
why
honor

now
ends
my

nor
confer
your

when
the

leave

there
a
fancy
some
lean
to
and
others
hate
that
when
this
life
is
ended
begins
new
work
for
the
soul
in
another
state
where
it
strives
and
gets
weary
loses
and
wins
where
the
strong
and
the
weak
this
world
congeries
repeat
in
large
what
they
practiced
in
small
through
life
after
life
in
unlimited
series
only
the
scale
to
be
changed
that
all
yet
i
hardly
know
when
a
soul
has
seen
by
the
means
of
evil
that
good
is
best
and
through
earth
and
its
noise
what
is
heaven
serene
when
our
faith
in
the
same
has
stood
the
test
why
the
child
grown
man
you
burn
the
rod
the
uses
of
labor
are
surely
done
there
remaineth
a
rest
for
the
people
of
god
and
i
have
had
troubles
enough
for
one
but
at
any
rate
i
have
loved
the
season
of
art
so
dim
and
dewy
my
sculptor
is
nicolo
the
pisan
my
painter
who
but
cimabue
nor
ever
was
a
man
of
them
all
indeed
from
these
to
ghiberti
and
ghirlandajo
could
say
that
he
missed
my
so
now
to
my
special
grievance
their
ghosts
still
stand
as
i
said
before
watching
each
fresco
flaked
and
rasped
blocked
up
knocked
out
or
whitewashed
no
getting
again
what
the
church
has
grasped
the
works
on
the
wall
must
take
their
chance
works
never
conceded
to
england
thick
clime
i
hope
they
prefer
their
inheritance
of
a
bucketful
of
italian
quicklime
when
they
go
at
length
with
such
a
shaking
of
heads
the
old
delusion
sadly
each
master
his
way
through
the
black
streets
taking
where
many
a
lost
work
breathes
though
badly
why
do
they
bethink
them
of
who
has
merited
why
not
reveal
while
their
pictures
dree
such
doom
how
a
captive
might
be
why
is
it
they
never
remember
me
not
that
i
expect
the
great
bigordi
nor
sandro
to
hear
me
chivalric
bellicose
nor
the
wronged
lippino
and
not
a
word
i
say
of
a
scrap
of
frà
angelico
but
are
you
too
fine
taddeo
gaddi
to
grant
me
a
taste
of
your
intonaco
some
jerome
that
seeks
the
heaven
with
a
sad
eye
not
a
churlish
saint
lorenzo
monaco
could
not
the
ghost
with
the
close
red
cap
my
pollajolo
the
twice
a
craftsman
save
me
a
sample
give
me
the
hap
of
a
muscular
christ
that
shows
the
draftsman
no
virgin
by
him
the
somewhat
petty
of
finical
touch
and
tempera
crumbly
could
not
alesso
baldovinetti
contribute
so
much
i
ask
him
humbly
margheritone
of
arezzo
with
the
garb
and
swaddling
barret
why
purse
up
mouth
and
beak
in
a
pet
so
you
bald
old
saturnine
parrot
not
a
poor
glimmering
crucifixion
where
in
the
foreground
kneels
the
donor
if
such
remain
as
is
my
conviction
the
hoarding
it
does
you
but
little
honor
they
pass
for
them
the
panels
may
thrill
the
tempera
grow
alive
and
tinglish
their
pictures
are
left
to
the
mercies
still
of
dealers
and
stealers
jews
and
the
english
who
seeing
mere
money
worth
in
their
prize
will
sell
it
to
somebody
calm
as
zeno
at
naked
high
art
and
in
ecstasies
before
some
vile
carlino
no
matter
for
these
but
giotto
you
have
you
allowed
as
the
babble
it
oh
never
it
shall
not
be
counted
true
that
a
certain
precious
little
tablet
which
buonarroti
eyed
like
a
lover
was
buried
so
long
in
oblivion
womb
and
left
for
another
than
i
to
discover
turns
up
at
last
and
to
whom
to
whom
i
that
have
haunted
the
dim
san

or
was
it
rather
the

in

what
if

take
up
my
hope
and
prophesy
when
the
hour
grows
ripe
and
a
certain
dotard
is
pitched
no
parcel
that
needs
invoicing
to
the
worse
side
of
the

gothard
we

begin
by

none
of

all

this

no

at

but
a
kind
of
sober

shall
ponder
once
freedom
restored
to

how

may
return
that

hated

go
each
trace
of

and
bring
us
the
days
of

hither
how
we
shall
prologuize
how
we
shall
perorate
utter
fit
things
upon
art
and
history
feel
truth
at
and

at
zero
rate
make
of
the

of

licks
out
of

into

while

then
one
shall
propose
in
a

curt

expurgate
and

with
scarcely
an

now
our
tale
of

turn

from

goes
the

flaps
at

at

will
walk
you
lover

if

those
two
in

if

say
the

draw
yourself
up
from

light
of

and
let
them
pass
as
they
will
too
soon
with
the
boon
and
the
blackbird
tune
and
may
and
june
what
i
love
best
in
all
the
world
is
a
castle
in
a
gash
of
the
apennine
or
look
for
me
old
fellow
of
mine
if
i
get
my
head
from
out
the
mouth
o
the
grave
and
loose
my
spirit
bands
and
come
again
to
the
land
of
lands
in
a
house
to
the
farther
south
where
the
baked
cicala
dies
of
drouth
and
one
sharp
tree
is
a
cypress
stands
by
the
many
hundred
years
rough
ripe
my
sentinel
to
guard
the
sands
to
the
water
edge
for
what
expands
before
the
house
but
the
great
opaque
blue
breadth
of
sea
without
a
break
while
in
the
house
forever
crumbles
some
fragment
of
the
frescoed
walls
from
blisters
where
a
scorpion
sprawls
a
girl
brings
and
tumbles
down
on
the
pavement
melons
and
says

my

queen

serves
for
me
when
fortune

lost
her
calais
open
my
heart
and
you
will
see
graved
inside
of

italy
such
lovers
old
are
i
and
she
so
it
always
was
so
shall
ever
be
from
abroad
oh
to
be
in
england
now
that
april
there
and
whoever
wakes
in
england
sees
some
morning
unaware
that
the
lowest
boughs
and
the
brushwood
sheaf
round
the
hole
are
in
tiny
leaf
while
the
chaffinch
sings
on
the
orchard
bough
in
england
now
and
after
april
when
may
follows
and
the
whitethroat
builds
and
all
the
swallows
hark
where
my
blossomed
in
the
hedge
leans
to
the
field
and
scatters
on
the
clover
blossoms
and
dewdrops
at
the
bent
spray
edge
that
the
wise
thrush
he
sings
each
song
twice
over
lest
you
should
think
he
never
could
recapture
the
first
fine
careless
rapture
and
though
the
fields
look
rough
with
hoary
dew
all
will
be
gay
when
noontide
wakes
anew
the
buttercups
the
little
children
dower
far
brighter
than
this
gaudy
from
the
sea
nobly
nobly
cape
saint
vincent
to
the

died

sunset
ran
one
glorious
reeking
into

bay
bluish
the

full
in

trafalgar
lay
in
the

northeast
distance

grand
and

here
and
here
did
england
help
me
how
can
i
help
england
say
whoso
turns
as
i
this
evening
turn
to
god
to
praise
and
pray
while
jove
planet
rises
yonder
silent
over
africa
saul
i
said
abner
at
last
thou
art
come
ere
i
tell
ere
thou
speak
kiss
my
cheek
wish
me
well
then
i
wished
it
and
did
kiss
his
cheek
and
he
since
the
king
o
my
friend
for
thy
countenance
sent
neither
drunken
nor
eaten
have
we
nor
until
from
his
tent
thou
return
with
the
joyful
assurance
the
king
liveth
yet
shall
our
lip
with
the
honey
be
bright
with
the
water
be
wet
for
out
of
the
black
silence
a
space
of
three
days
not
a
sound
hath
escaped
to
thy
servants
of
prayer
nor
of
praise
to
betoken
that
saul
and
the
spirit
have
ended
their
strife
and
that
faint
in
his
triumph
the
monarch
sinks
back
upon
life
ii
yet
now
my
heart
leaps
o
beloved
god
child
with
his
dew
on
thy
gracious
gold
hair
and
those
lilies
still
living
and
blue
just
broken
to
twine
round
thy
as
if
no
wild
heat
were
now
raging
to
torture
the
desert
iii
then
i
as
was
meet
knelt
down
to
the
god
of
my
fathers
and
rose
on
my
feet
and
ran
the
sand
burnt
to
powder
the
tent
was
unlooped
i
pulled
up
the
spear
that
obstructed
and
under
i
stooped
hands
and
knees
on
the
slippery
all
withered
and
gone
that
extends
to
the
second
enclosure
i
groped
my
way
on
till
i
felt
where
the
foldskirts
fly
open
then
once
more
i
prayed
and
opened
the
foldskirts
and
entered
and
was
not
afraid
but
spoke
here
is
david
thy
servant
and
no
voice
replied
at
the
first
i
saw
naught
but
the
blackness
but
soon
i
descried
a
something
more
black
than
the
blackness
the
vast
the
upright
main
prop
which
sustains
the
pavilion
and
slow
into
sight
grew
a
figure
against
it
gigantic
and
blackest
of
all
then
a
sunbeam
that
burst
through
the
showed
saul
iv
he
stood
as
erect
as
that
both
arms
stretched
out
wide
on
the
great
in
the
center
that
goes
to
each
side
he
relaxed
not
a
muscle
but
hung
there
as
caught
in
his
pangs
and
waiting
his
change
the
all
heavily
hangs
far
away
from
his
kind
in
the
pine
till
deliverance
come
with
the
springtime
so
agonized
saul
drear
and
stark
blind
and
dumb
v
then
i
tuned
my
harp
took
off
the
lilies
we
twine
round
its
chords
lest
they
snap
the
stress
of
the
noontide
those
sunbeams
like
swords
and
i
first
played
the
tune
all
our
sheep
know
as
one
after
one
so
docile
they
come
to
the
till
folding
be
done
they
are
white
and
untorn
by
the
bushes
for
lo
they
have
fed
where
the
long
grasses
stifle
the
water
within
the
stream
bed
and
now
one
after
one
seeks
its
lodging
as
star
follows
star
into
eve
and
the
blue
far
above
us
so
blue
and
so
far
vi
then
the
tune
for
which
quails
on
the
cornland
will
each
leave
his
mate
to
fly
after
the
player
then
what
makes
the
crickets
elate
till
for
boldness
they
fight
one
another
and
then
what
has
weight
to
set
the
quick
jerboa
outside
his
sand
house
there
are
none
such
as
he
for
a
wonder
half
bird
and
half
mouse
god
made
all
the
creatures
and
gave
them
our
love
and
our
fear
to
give
sign
we
and
they
are
his
children
one
family
here
vii
then
i
played
the
of
our
reapers
their
when
hand
grasps
at
hand
eye
lights
eye
in
good
friendship
and
great
hearts
expand
and
grow
one
in
the
sense
of
this
world
and
then
the
last
song
when
the
dead
man
is
praised
on
his
journey
bear
bear
him
along
with
his
few
faults
shut
up
like
dead
flowerets
are
balm
seeds
not
here
to
console
us
the
land
has
none
left
such
as
he
on
the
bier
oh
would
we
might
keep
thee
my
brother
and
then
the
glad
chaunt
of
the
marriage
first
go
the
young
maidens
next
she
whom
we
vaunt
as
the
beauty
the
pride
of
our
and
then
the
great
march
wherein
man
runs
to
man
to
assist
him
and
buttress
an
arch
naught
can
break
who
shall
harm
them
our
friends
then
the
chorus
intoned
as
the
levites
go
up
to
the
altar
in
glory
enthroned
but
i
stopped
here
for
here
in
the
darkness
saul
groaned
viii
and
i
paused
held
my
breath
in
such
silence
and
listened
apart
and
the
tent
shook
for
mighty
saul
shuddered
and
sparkles
dart
from
the
jewels
that
woke
in
his
turban
at
once
with
a
start
all
its
lordly
and
rubies
courageous
at
heart
so
the
head
but
the
body
still
moved
not
still
hung
there
erect
and
i
bent
once
again
to
my
playing
pursued
it
unchecked
as
i
sang
ix
oh
our
manhood
prime
vigor
no
spirit
feels
waste
not
a
muscle
is
stopped
in
its
playing
nor
sinew
unbraced
oh
the
wild
joys
of
living
the
leaping
from
rock
up
to
rock
the
strong
rending
of
boughs
from
the
the
cool
silver
shock
of
the
plunge
in
a
pool
living
water
the
hunt
of
the
bear
and
the
sultriness
showing
the
lion
is
couched
in
his
lair
and
the
meal
the
rich
dates
yellowed
over
with
gold
dust
divine
and
the
steeped
in
the
pitcher
the
full
draft
of
wine
and
the
sleep
in
the
dried
where
bulrushes
tell
that
the
water
was
wont
to
go
warbling
so
softly
and
well
how
good
is
man
life
the
mere
living
how
fit
to
employ
all
the
heart
and
the
soul
and
the
senses
forever
in
joy
hast
thou
loved
the
white
locks
of
thy
father
whose
sword
thou
didst
guard
when
he
trusted
thee
forth
with
the
armies
for
glorious
reward
didst
thou
see
the
thin
hands
of
thy
mother
held
up
as
men
sung
the
low
song
of
the
and
hear
her
faint
tongue
joining
in
while
it
could
to
the
witness
one
more
attest
i
have
lived
seen
god
hand
through
a
lifetime
and
all
was
for
best
then
they
sung
through
their
tears
in
strong
triumph
not
much
but
the
rest
and
thy
brothers
the
help
and
the
contest
the
working
whence
grew
such
result
as
from
seething
the
spirit
strained
true
and
the
friends
of
thy
boyhood
that
boyhood
of
wonder
and
hope
present
promise
and
wealth
of
the
future
beyond
the
eye
scope
till
lo
thou
art
grown
to
a
monarch
a
people
is
thine
and
all
gifts
which
the
world
offers
singly
on
one
head
combine
on
one
head
all
the
beauty
and
strength
love
and
rage
like
the
throe
that
in
the
rock
helps
its
labor
and
lets
the
gold
go
high
ambition
and
deeds
which
surpass
it
fame
crowning
them
all
brought
to
blaze
on
the
head
of
one
creature
king
saul
x
and
lo
with
that
leap
of
my
spirit
heart
hand
harp
and
voice
each
lifting
saul
name
out
of
sorrow
each
bidding
rejoice
saul
fame
in
the
light
it
was
made
for
as
when
dare
i
say
the
lord
army
in
rapture
of
service
strains
through
its
array
and
upsoareth
the
saul
cried
i
and
stopped
and
waited
the
thing
that
should
follow
then
saul
who
hung
propped
by
the
tent
in
the
center
was
struck
by
his
name
have
ye
seen
when
spring
arrowy
summons
goes
right
to
the
aim
and
some
mountain
the
last
to
withstand
her
that
held
he
alone
while
the
vale
laughed
in
freedom
and
flowers
on
a
broad
bust
of
stone
a
year
snow
bound
about
for
a
breastplate
leaves
grasp
of
the
sheet
fold
on
fold
all
at
once
it
crowds
thunderously
down
to
his
feet
and
there
fronts
you
stark
black
but
alive
yet
your
mountain
of
old
with
his
rents
the
successive
bequeathings
of
ages
untold
yea
each
harm
got
in
fighting
your
battles
each
furrow
and
scar
of
his
head
thrust
you
and
the
tempest
all
hail
there
they
are
now
again
to
be
softened
with
verdure
again
hold
the
nest
of
the
dove
tempt
the
goat
and
its
young
to
the
green
on
his
crest
for
their
food
in
the
ardors
of
summer
one
long
shudder
thrilled
all
the
tent
till
the
very
air
tingled
then
sank
and
was
stilled
at
the
king
self
left
standing
before
me
released
and
aware
what
was
gone
what
remained
all
to
traverse
hope
and
despair
death
was
past
life
not
come
so
he
waited
awhile
his
right
hand
held
the
brow
held
the
eyes
left
too
vacant
forthwith
to
remand
to
their
place
what
new
objects
should
enter
was
saul
as
before
i
looked
up
and
dared
gaze
at
those
eyes
nor
was
hurt
any
more
than
by
slow
pallid
sunsets
in
autumn
ye
watch
from
the
shore
at
their
sad
level
gaze
the
ocean
a
sun
slow
decline
over
hills
which
resolved
in
stern
silence
and
entwine
base
with
base
to
knit
strength
more
intensely
so
arm
folded
arm
the
chest
whose
slow
heavings
subsided
xi
what
spell
or
what
charm
for
awhile
there
was
trouble
within
me
what
next
should
i
urge
to
sustain
him
where
song
had
restored
him
song
filled
to
the
verge
his
cup
with
the
wine
of
this
life
pressing
all
that
it
yields
of
mere
fruitage
the
strength
and
the
beauty
beyond
on
what
fields
glean
a
vintage
more
potent
and
perfect
to
brighten
the
eye
and
bring
blood
to
the
lip
and
commend
them
the
cup
they
put
by
he
saith
it
is
good
still
he
drinks
not
he
lets
me
praise
life
gives
assent
yet
would
die
for
his
own
part
xii
then
fancies
grew
rife
which
had
come
long
ago
on
the
pasture
when
round
me
the
sheep
fed
in
silence
above
the
one
eagle
wheeled
slow
as
in
sleep
and
i
lay
in
my
hollow
and
mused
on
the
world
that
might
lie
his
ken
though
i
saw
but
the
strip
the
hill
and
the
sky
and
i
laughed
since
my
days
are
ordained
to
be
passed
with
my
flocks
let
me
people
at
least
with
my
fancies
the
plains
and
the
rocks
dream
the
life
i
am
never
to
mix
with
and
image
the
show
of
mankind
as
they
live
in
those
fashions
i
hardly
shall
know
schemes
of
life
its
best
rules
and
right
uses
the
courage
that
gains
and
the
prudence
that
keeps
what
men
strive
for
and
now
these
old
trains
of
vague
thought
came
again
i
grew
surer
so
once
more
the
string
of
my
harp
made
response
to
my
spirit
as
thus
xiii
yea
my
king
i
began
thou
dost
well
in
rejecting
mere
comforts
that
spring
from
the
mere
mortal
life
held
in
common
by
man
and
by
brute
in
our
flesh
grows
the
branch
of
this
life
in
our
soul
it
bears
fruit
thou
hast
marked
the
slow
rise
of
the
tree
how
its
stem
trembled
first
till
it
passed
the
kid
lip
the
stag
antler
then
safely
outburst
the
all
round
and
thou
mindest
when
these
too
in
turn
broke
and
the
seemed
perfect
yet
more
was
to
learn
the
good
that
comes
in
with
the
our
dates
shall
we
slight
when
their
juice
brings
a
cure
for
all
sorrow
or
care
for
the
plight
of
the
palm
self
whose
slow
growth
produced
them
not
so
stem
and
branch
shall
decay
nor
be
known
in
their
place
while
the
shall
stanch
every
wound
of
man
spirit
in
winter
i
pour
thee
such
wine
leave
the
flesh
to
the
fate
it
was
fit
for
the
spirit
be
thine
by
the
spirit
when
age
shall
thee
thou
still
shalt
enjoy
more
indeed
than
at
first
when
inconscious
the
life
of
a
boy
crush
that
life
and
behold
its
wine
running
each
deed
thou
hast
done
dies
revives
goes
to
work
in
the
world
until
as
the
sun
looking
down
on
the
earth
though
clouds
spoil
him
though
tempests
efface
can
find
nothing
his
own
deed
produced
not
must
everywhere
trace
the
results
of
his
past
so
each
ray
of
thy
will
every
flash
of
thy
passion
and
prowess
long
over
shall
thrill
thy
whole
people
the
countless
with
ardor
till
they
too
give
forth
a
like
cheer
to
their
sons
who
in
turn
fill
the
south
and
the
north
with
the
radiance
thy
deed
was
the
germ
of
carouse
in
the
past
but
the
license
of
age
has
its
limit
thou
diest
at
last
as
the
lion
when
age
dims
his
eyeball
the
rose
at
her
height
so
with
man
so
his
power
and
his
beauty
forever
take
flight
no
again
a
long
draft
of
my
look
forth
the
years
thou
hast
done
now

eyes

the
actual

with
the
seer

saul

in
the
depth
of
the
vale

his
tomb

arise

gray
mountain
of
marble
heaped

built
to
the

it

their

in
thy

then
first
of
the
mighty
thank
god
that
thou
art
xiv
and
behold
while
i
sang
but
o
thou
who
didst
grant
me
that
day
and
before
it
not
seldom
hast
granted
thy
help
to
essay
carry
on
and
complete
an
adventure
my
shield
and
my
sword
in
that
act
where
my
soul
was
thy
servant
thy
word
was
my
word
still
be
with
me
who
then
at
the
summit
of
human
endeavor
and
scaling
the
highest
man
thought
could
gazed
hopeless
as
ever
on
the
new
stretch
of
heaven
above
me
till
mighty
to
save
just
one
lift
of
thy
hand
cleared
that
distance
god
throne
from
man
grave
let
me
tell
out
my
tale
to
its
evening
my
voice
to
my
heart
which
can
scarce
dare
believe
in
what
marvels
last
night
i
took
part
as
this
morning
i
gather
the
fragments
alone
with
my
sheep
and
still
fear
lest
the
terrible
glory
evanish
like
sleep
for
i
wake
in
the
gray
dewy
covert
while
hebron
upheaves
the
dawn
struggling
with
night
on
his
shoulder
and
kidron
retrieves
slow
the
damage
of
yesterday
sunshine
xv
i
say
then
my
song
while
i
sang
thus
assuring
the
monarch
and
ever
more
strong
made
a
proffer
of
good
to
console
him
he
slowly
resumed
his
old
motions
and
habitudes
kingly
the
right
hand
replumed
his
black
locks
to
their
wonted
composure
adjusted
the
swathes
of
his
turban
and
see
the
huge
sweat
that
his
countenance
bathes
he
wipes
off
with
the
robe
and
he
girds
now
his
loins
as
of
yore
and
feels
slow
for
the
armlets
of
price
with
the
clasp
set
before
he
is
saul
ye
remember
in
glory
ere
error
had
bent
the
broad
brow
from
the
daily
communion
and
still
though
much
spent
be
the
life
and
the
bearing
that
front
you
the
same
god
did
choose
to
receive
what
a
man
may
waste
desecrate
never
quite
lose
so
sank
he
along
by
the
till
stayed
by
the
pile
of
his
armor
and
and
garments
he
leaned
there
awhile
and
sat
out
my
singing
one
arm
round
the
to
raise
his
bent
head
and
the
other
hung
slack
till
i
touched
on
the
praise
i
foresaw
from
all
men
in
all
time
to
the
man
patient
there
and
thus
ended
the
harp
falling
forward
then
first
i
was
that
he
sat
as
i
say
with
my
head
just
above
his
vast
knees
which
were
thrust
out
on
each
side
around
me
like
which
please
to
encircle
a
lamb
when
it
slumbers
i
looked
up
to
know
if
the
best
i
could
do
had
brought
solace
he
spoke
not
but
slow
lifted
up
the
hand
slack
at
his
side
till
he
laid
it
with
care
soft
and
grave
but
in
mild
settled
will
on
my
brow
through
my
hair
the
large
fingers
were
pushed
and
he
bent
back
my
head
with
kind
power
all
my
face
back
intent
to
peruse
it
as
men
do
a
flower
thus
held
he
me
there
with
his
great
eyes
that
scrutinized
mine
and
oh
all
my
heart
how
it
loved
him
but
where
was
the
sign
i
yearned
could
i
help
thee
my
father
inventing
a
bliss
i
would
add
to
that
life
of
the
past
both
the
future
and
this
i
would
give
thee
new
life
altogether
as
good
ages
hence
as
this
moment
had
love
but
the
warrant
love
heart
to
dispense
xvi
then
the
truth
came
upon
me
no
harp
more
no
song
more
outbroke
xvii
i
have
gone
the
whole
round
of
creation
i
saw
and
i
spoke
i
a
work
of
god
hand
for
that
purpose
received
in
my
brain
and
pronounced
on
the
rest
of
his
handwork
returned
him
again
his
creation
approval
or
censure
i
spoke
as
i
saw
i
report
as
a
man
may
of
god
work
all
love
yet
all
law
now
i
lay
down
the
judgeship
he
lent
me
each
faculty
tasked
to
perceive
him
has
gained
an
abyss
where
a
dewdrop
was
asked
have
i
knowledge
confounded
it
shrivels
at
wisdom
laid
bare
have
i
forethought
how
purblind
how
blank
to
the
infinite
care
do
i
task
any
faculty
highest
to
image
success
i
but
open
my
eyes
and
perfection
no
more
and
no
less
in
the
kind
i
imagined
me
and
god
is
seen
god
in
the
star
in
the
stone
in
the
flesh
in
the
soul
and
the
clod
and
thus
looking
within
and
around
me
i
ever
renew
with
that
stoop
of
the
soul
which
in
bending
upraises
it
too
the
submission
of
man
to
god
as
by
each
new
obeisance
in
spirit
i
climb
to
his
feet
yet
with
all
this
abounding
experience
this
deity
known
i
shall
dare
to
discover
some
province
some
gift
of
my
own
there
a
faculty
pleasant
to
exercise
hard
to
hoodwink
i
am
fain
to
keep
still
in
abeyance
i
laugh
as
i
think
lest
insisting
to
claim
and
parade
in
it
wot
ye
i
worst
the
giver
in
one
behold
i
could
love
if
i
durst
but
i
sink
the
pretension
as
fearing
a
man
may
god
own
speed
in
the
one
way
of
love
i
abstain
for
love
sake
what
my
soul
see
thus
far
and
no
farther
when
doors
great
and
small
flew
ope
at
our
touch
should
the
hundredth
appall
in
the
least
things
have
faith
yet
distrust
in
the
greatest
of
all
do
i
find
love
so
full
in
my
nature
god
ultimate
gift
that
i
doubt
his
own
love
can
compete
with
it
here
the
parts
shift
here
the
creature
surpass
the
creator
the
end
what
began
would
i
fain
in
my
impotent
yearning
do
all
for
this
man
and
dare
doubt
he
alone
shall
not
help
him
who
yet
alone
can
would
it
ever
have
entered
my
mind
the
bare
will
much
less
power
to
bestow
on
this
saul
what
i
sang
of
the
marvelous
dower
of
the
life
he
was
gifted
and
filled
with
to
make
such
a
soul
such
a
body
and
then
such
an
earth
for
insphering
the
whole
and
doth
it
not
enter
my
mind
as
my
warm
tears
attest
these
good
things
being
given
to
go
on
and
give
one
more
the
best

save
and
redeem

of

at
the
difficult
minute
snatch
saul
the
mistake
saul
the
failure
the
ruin
he
seems
now
and
bid
him
awake
from
the
dream
the
probation
the
prelude
to
find
himself
set
clear
and
safe
in
new
light
and
new
life
a
new
harmony
yet
to
be

of
the

sure
by
the
triumphantly
winning

the

i
believe
it
is
thou
god
that
givest
is
i
who
receive
in
the
first
is
the
last
in
thy
will
is
my
power
to
believe
all
one
gift
thou
canst
grant
it
moreover
as
prompt
to
my
prayer
as
i
breathe
out
this
breath
as
i
open
these
arms
to
the
air
from
thy
will
stream
the
worlds
life
and
nature
thy
dread
sabaoth
will
the
mere
atoms
despise
me
why
am
i
not
loath
to
look
that
even
that
in
the
face
too
why
is
it
i
dare
think
but
lightly
of
such
impuissance
what
stops
my
despair
this
is
not
what
man
does
which
exalts
him
but
what
man
would
do
see
the
king
i
would
help
him
but
can
not
the
wishes
fall
through
could
i
wrestle
to
raise
him
from
sorrow
grow
poor

fill
up

starve
my

knowing

my

oh
speak

would
i
suffer

him

so

thou
so
wilt
thou
so
shall
crown
thee
the
topmost
ineffablest
uttermost
crown
and
thy
love
fill
infinitude
wholly
nor

who
did
most
shall
bear
most
the
strongest
shall
stand
the
most
weak
is
the
weakness
in
strength
that
i
cry
for
my
flesh
that
i
seek
in
the
godhead
i
seek
and
i
find
it
o
saul
it
shall
be
a
face
like
my
face
that
receives
thee
a
man
like
to
me
thou
shalt
love
and
be
loved
by
forever
a
hand
like
this
hand
shall
throw
open
the
gates
of
new
life
to
thee
see
the
christ
stand
xix
i
know
not
too
well
how
i
found
my
way
home
in
the
night
there
were
witnesses
cohorts
about
me
to
left
and
to
right
angels
powers
the
unuttered
unseen
the
alive
the
aware
i
repressed
i
got
through
them
as
hardly
as
strugglingly
there
as
a
runner
beset
by
the
populace
famished
for
news
life
or
death
the
whole
earth
was
awakened
hell
loosed
with
her
crews
and
the
stars
of
night
beat
with
emotion
and
tingled
and
shot
out
in
fire
the
strong
pain
of
pent
knowledge
but
i
fainted
not
for
the
hand
still
impelled
me
at
once
and
supported
suppressed
all
the
tumult
and
quenched
it
with
quiet
and
holy
behest
till
the
rapture
was
shut
in
itself
and
the
earth
sank
to
rest
anon
at
the
dawn
all
that
trouble
had
withered
from
earth
not
so
much
but
i
saw
it
die
out
in
the
day
tender
birth
in
the
gathered
intensity
brought
to
the
gray
of
the
hills
in
the
shuddering
forests
held
breath
in
the
sudden
in
the
startled
wild
beasts
that
bore
off
each
with
eye
sidling
still
though
averted
with
wonder
and
dread
in
the
birds
stiff
and
chill
that
rose
heavily
as
i
approached
them
made
stupid
with
awe
the
serpent
that
slid
away
silent
he
felt
the
new
law
the
same
stared
in
the
white
humid
faces
upturned
by
the
flowers
the
same
worked
in
the
heart
of
the
cedar
and
moved
the
and
the
little
brooks
witnessing
murmured
persistent
and
low
with
their
obstinate
all
but
hushed
voices
so
it
is
so
my
star
all
that
i
know
of
a
certain
star
is
it
can
throw
like
the
angled
spar
now
a
dart
of
red
now
a
dart
of
blue
till
my
friends
have
said
they
would
fain
see
too
my
star
that
dartles
the
red
and
the
blue
then
it
stops
like
a
bird
like
a
flower
hangs
furled
they
must
solace
themselves
with
the
saturn
above
it
what
matter
to
me
if
their
star
is
a
world
mine
has
opened
its
soul
to
me
therefore
i
love
it
two
in
the
campagna
i
wonder
do
you
feel
today
as
i
have
felt
since
hand
in
hand
we
sat
down
on
the
grass
to
stray
in
spirit
better
through
the
land
this
morn
of
rome
and
may
for
me
i
touched
a
thought
i
know
has
tantalized
me
many
times
like
turns
of
thread
the
spiders
throw
mocking
across
our
path
for
rhymes
to
catch
at
and
let
go
help
me
to
hold
it
first
it
left
the
yellowing
fennel
run
to
seed
there
branching
from
the
brickwork
cleft
some
old
tomb
ruin
yonder
weed
took
up
the
floating
weft
where
one
small
orange
cup
amassed
five
beetles
blind
and
green
they
grope
among
the
and
last
everywhere
on
the
grassy
slope
i
traced
it
hold
it
fast
the
champaign
with
its
endless
fleece
of
feathery
grasses
everywhere
silence
and
passion
joy
and
peace
an
everlasting
wash
of
air
rome
ghost
since
her
decease
such
life
here
through
such
lengths
of
hours
such
miracles
performed
in
play
such
primal
naked
forms
of
flowers
such
letting
nature
have
her
way
while
heaven
looks
from
its
towers
how
say
you
let
us
o
my
dove
let
us
be
unashamed
of
soul
as
earth
lies
bare
to
heaven
above
how
is
it
under
our
control
to
love
or
not
to
love
i
would
that
you
were
all
to
me
you
that
are
just
so
much
no
more
nor
yours
nor
mine
nor
slave
nor
free
where
does
the
fault
lie
what
the
core
o
the
wound
since
wound
must
be
i
would
i
could
adopt
your
will
see
with
your
eyes
and
set
my
heart
beating
by
yours
and
drink
my
fill
at
your
soul
springs
your
part
my
part
in
life
for
good
and
no
i
yearn
upward
touch
you
close
then
stand
away
i
kiss
your
cheek
catch
your
soul
warmth
i
pluck
the
rose
and
love
it
more
than
tongue
can
speak
then
the
good
minute
goes
already
how
am
i
so
far
out
of
that
minute
must
i
go
still
like
the
no
bar
onward
whenever
light
winds
blow
fixed
by
no
friendly
star
just
when
i
seemed
about
to
learn
where
is
the
thread
now
off
again
the
old
trick
only
i
discern
infinite
passion
and
the
pain
of
finite
hearts
that
yearn
in
three
days
so
i
shall
see
her
in
three
days
and
just
one
night
but
nights
are
short
then
two
long
hours
and
that
is
morn
see
how
i
come
unchanged
unworn
feel
where
my
life
broke
off
from
thine
how
fresh
the
splinters
keep
and
fine
only
a
touch
and
we
combine
too
long
this
time
of
year
the
days
but
nights
at
least
the
nights
are
short
as
night
shows
where
her
one
moon
is
a
of
pure
light
and
bliss
so
life
night
gives
my
lady
birth
and
my
eyes
hold
her
what
is
worth
the
rest
of
heaven
the
rest
of
earth
o
loaded
curls
release
your
store
of
warmth
and
scent
as
once
before
the
tingling
hair
did
lights
and
darks
outbreaking
into
fairy
sparks
when
under
curl
and
curl
i
pried
after
the
warmth
and
scent
inside
through
lights
and
darks
how
manifold
the
dark
inspired
the
light
controlled
as
early
art
embrowns
the
gold
what
great
fear
should
one
say
three
days
that
change
the
world
might
change
as
well
your
fortune
and
if
joy
delays
be
happy
that
no
worse
befell
what
small
fear
if
another
says
three
days
and
one
short
night
beside
may
throw
no
shadow
on
your
ways
but
years
must
teem
with
change
untried
with
chance
not
easily
defied
with
an
end
somewhere
undescried
no
fear
or
if
a
fear
be
born
this
minute
it
dies
out
in
scorn
fear
i
shall
see
her
in
three
days
and
one
night
now
the
nights
are
short
then
just
two
hours
and
that
is
morn
the
a
picture
at
fano
dear
and
great
angel
wouldst
thou
only
leave
that
child
when
thou
hast
done
with
him
for
me
let
me
sit
all
the
day
here
that
when
eve
shall
find
performed
thy
special
ministry
and
time
come
for
departure
thou
suspending
thy
flight
mayst
see
another
child
for
tending
another
still
to
quiet
and
retrieve
then
i
shall
feel
thee
step
one
step
no
more
from
where
thou
standest
now
to
where
i
gaze
and
suddenly
my
head
is
covered
with
those
wings
white
above
the
child
who
prays
now
on
that
tomb
and
i
shall
feel
thee
guarding
me
out
of
all
the
world
for
me
discarding
yon
heaven
thy
home
that
waits
and
opes
its
door
i
would
not
look
up
thither
past
thy
head
because
the
door
opes
like
that
child
i
know
for
i
should
have
thy
gracious
face
instead
thou
bird
of
god
and
wilt
thou
bend
me
low
like
him
and
lay
like
his
my
hands
together
and
lift
them
up
to
pray
and
gently
tether
me
as
thy
lamb
there
with
thy
garment
spread
if
this
was
ever
granted
i
would
rest
my
head
beneath
thine
while
thy
healing
hands
both
my
eyes
beside
thy
breast
pressing
the
brain
which
too
much
thought
expands
back
to
its
proper
size
again
and
smoothing
distortion
down
till
every
nerve
had
soothing
and
all
lay
quiet
happy
and
suppressed
how
soon
all
worldly
wrong
would
be
repaired
i
think
how
i
should
view
the
earth
and
skies
and
sea
when
once
again
my
brow
was
bared
after
thy
healing
with
such
different
eyes
o
world
as
god
has
made
it
all
is
beauty
and
knowing
this
is
love
and
love
is
duty
what
further
may
be
sought
for
or
declared
guercino
drew
this
angel
i
saw
teach
alfred
dear
friend
that
little
child
to
pray
holding
the
little
hands
up
each
to
each
pressed
gently
with
his
own
head
turned
away
over
the
earth
where
so
much
lay
before
him
of
work
to
do
though
heaven
was
opening
him
and
he
was
left
at
fano
by
the
beach
we
were
at
fano
and
three
times
we
went
to
sit
and
see
him
in
his
chapel
there
and
drink
his
beauty
to
our
soul
content
my
angel
with
me
too
and
since
i
care
for
dear
guercino
fame
to
which
in
power
and
glory
comes
this
picture
for
a
dower
fraught
with
a
pathos
so
magnificent
and
since
he
did
not
work
thus
earnestly
at
all
times
and
has
else
endured
some
wrong
i
took
one
thought
his
picture
struck
from
me
and
spread
it
out
translating
it
to
song
my
love
is
here
where
are
you
dear
old
friend
how
rolls
the
wairoa
at
your
world
far
end
this
is
ancona
yonder
is
the
sea
memorabilia
ah
did
you
once
see
shelley
plain
and
did
he
stop
and
speak
to
you
and
did
you
speak
to
him
again
how
strange
it
seems
and
new
but
you
were
living
before
that
and
also
you
are
living
after
and
the
memory
i
started
at
my
starting
moves
your
laughter
i
crossed
a
moor
with
a
name
of
its
own
and
a
certain
use
in
the
world
no
doubt
yet
a
of
it
shines
alone
the
blank
miles
round
about
for
there
i
picked
up
on
the
heather
and
there
i
put
inside
my
breast
a
molted
feather
an
well
i
forget
the
rest
incident
of
the
french
camp
you
know
we
french
stormed
ratisbon
a
mile
or
so
away
on
a
little
mound
napoleon
stood
on
our
with
neck
you
fancy
how
legs
wide
arms
locked
behind
as
if
to
balance
the
prone
brow
oppressive
with
its
mind
just
as
perhaps
he
mused
my
plans
that
soar
to
earth
may
fall
let
once
my
lannes
waver
at
yonder
wall
out
the
there
flew
a
rider
bound
on
bound
nor
bridle
drew
until
he
reached
the
mound
then
off
there
flung
in
smiling
joy
and
held
himself
erect
by
just
his
horse
mane
a
boy
you
hardly
could
suspect
so
tight
he
kept
his
lips
compressed
scarce
any
blood
came
through
you
looked
twice
ere
you
saw
his
breast
was
all
but
shot
in
two
well
cried
he
emperor
by
god
grace
we
got
you
ratisbon
the
marshal
in
the
and
you
be
there
anon
to
see
your
flap
his
vans
where
i
to
heart
desire
perched
him
the
chief
eye
flashed
his
plans
soared
up
again
like
fire
the
chief
eye
flashed
but
presently
softened
itself
as
sheathes
a
film
the
eye
when
her
bruised
eaglet
breathes
you
wounded
nay
the
soldier
pride
touched
to
the
quick
he
said
i
killed
sire
and
his
chief
beside
smiling
the
boy
fell
dead
my
last
duchess
ferrara
that
my
last
duchess
painted
on
the
wall
looking
as
if
she
were
alive
i
call
that
piece
a
wonder
now
frà
pandolf
hands
worked
busily
a
day
and
there
she
stands
please
you
sit
and
look
at
her
i
said
frà
pandolf
by
design
for
never
read
strangers
like
you
that
pictured
countenance
the
depth
and
passion
of
its
earnest
glance
but
to
myself
they
turned
since
none
puts
by
the
curtain
i
have
drawn
for
you
but
i
and
seemed
as
they
would
ask
me
if
they
durst
how
such
a
glance
came
there
so
not
the
first
are
you
to
turn
and
ask
thus
sir
was
not
her
husband
presence
only
called
that
spot
of
joy
into
the
duchess
cheek
perhaps
frà
pandolf
chanced
to
say
her
mantle
laps
over
my
lady
wrist
too
much
or
paint
must
never
hope
to
reproduce
the
faint
that
dies
along
her
throat
such
stuff
was
courtesy
she
thought
and
cause
enough
for
calling
up
that
spot
of
joy
she
had
a
heart
how
shall
i
say
too
soon
made
glad
too
easily
impressed
she
liked
she
looked
on
and
her
looks
went
everywhere
sir
was
all
one
my
favor
at
her
breast
the
dropping
of
the
daylight
in
the
west
the
bough
of
cherries
some
officious
fool
broke
in
the
orchard
for
her
the
white
mule
she
rode
with
round
the
terrace
all
and
each
would
draw
from
her
alike
the
approving
speech
or
blush
at
least
she
thanked
men
good
but
thanked
somehow
i
know
not
how
as
if
she
ranked
my
gift
of
a
name
with
anybody
gift
who
stoop
to
blame
this
sort
of
trifling
even
had
you
skill
in
speech
which
i
have
not
to
make
your
will
quite
clear
to
such
an
one
and
say
just
this
or
that
in
you
disgusts
me
here
you
miss
or
there
exceed
the
mark
and
if
she
let
herself
be
lessoned
so
nor
plainly
set
her
wits
to
yours
forsooth
and
made
excuse
then
would
be
some
stooping
and
i
choose
never
to
stoop
oh
sir
she
smiled
no
doubt
i
passed
her
but
who
passed
without
much
the
same
smile
this
grew
i
gave
commands
then
all
smiles
stopped
together
there
she
stands
as
if
alive
please
you
rise
we
meet
the
company
below
then
i
repeat
the
count
your
master
known
munificence
is
ample
warrant
that
no
just
pretense
of
mine
for
dowry
will
be
disallowed
though
his
fair
daughter
self
as
i
avowed
at
starting
is
my
object
nay
we
go
together
down
sir
notice
neptune
though
taming
a
thought
a
rarity
which
claus
of
innsbruck
cast
in
bronze
for
me
the
boy
and
the
angel
morning
evening
noon
and
night
praise
god
sang
theocrite
then
to
his
poor
trade
he
turned
whereby
the
daily
meal
was
earned
hard
he
labored
long
and
well
his
work
the
boy
curls
fell
but
ever
at
each
period
he
stopped
and
sang
praise
god
then
back
again
his
curls
he
threw
and
cheerful
turned
to
work
anew
said
blaise
the
listening
monk
well
done
i
doubt
not
thou
art
heard
my
son
as
well
as
if
thy
voice
today
were
praising
god
the
pope
great
way
this
easter
day
the
pope
at
rome
praises
god
from
peter
dome
said
theocrite
would
god
that
i
might
praise
him
that
great
way
and
die
night
passed
day
shone
and
theocrite
was
gone
with
god
a
day
endures
alway
a
thousand
years
are
but
a
day
god
said
in
heaven
nor
day
nor
night
now
brings
the
voice
of
my
delight
then
gabriel
like
a
rainbow
birth
spread
his
wings
and
sank
to
earth
entered
in
flesh
the
empty
cell
lived
there
and
played
the
craftsman
well
and
morning
evening
noon
and
night
praised
god
in
place
of
theocrite
and
from
a
boy
to
youth
he
grew
the
man
put
off
the
stripling
hue
the
man
matured
and
fell
away
into
the
season
of
decay
and
ever
the
trade
he
bent
and
ever
lived
on
earth
content
he
did
god
will
to
him
all
one
if
on
the
earth
or
in
the
sun
god
said
a
praise
is
in
mine
ear
there
is
no
doubt
in
it
no
fear
so
sing
old
worlds
and
so
new
worlds
that
from
my
footstool
go
clearer
loves
sound
other
ways
i
miss
my
little
human
praise
then
forth
sprang
gabriel
wings
off
fell
the
flesh
disguise
remained
the
cell
was
easter
day
he
flew
to
rome
and
paused
above
saint
peter
dome
in
the
close
by
the
great
outer
gallery
with
his
holy
vestments
dight
stood
the
new
pope
theocrite
and
all
his
past
career
came
back
upon
him
clear
since
when
a
boy
he
plied
his
trade
till
on
his
life
the
sickness
weighed
and
in
his
cell
when

story
i
hamelin
town
in
brunswick
by
famous
hanover
city
the
river
weser
deep
and
wide
washes
its
wall
on
the
southern
side
a
pleasanter
spot
you
never
spied
but
when
begins
my
ditty
almost
five
hundred
years
ago
to
see
the
townsfolk
suffer
so
from
vermin
was
a
pity
ii
rats
they
fought
the
dogs
and
killed
the
cats
and
bit
the
babies
in
the
cradles
and
ate
the
cheeses
out
of
the
vats
and
licked
the
soup
from
the
cooks
own
ladles
split
open
the
kegs
of
salted
sprats
made
nests
inside

sunday

and
even
spoiled
the

by
drowning
their
speaking
with
shrieking
and
squeaking
in
fifty
different
sharps
and
flats
iii
at
last
the
people
in
a
body
to
the
town
hall
came
flocking
is
clear
cried
they
our
mayor
a
noddy
and
as
for
our
corporation
shocking
to
think
we
buy
gowns
lined
with
ermine
for
dolts
that
ca
or
wo
determine
what
best
to
rid
us
of
our
vermin
you
hope
because
you
old
and
obese
to
find
in
the
furry
civic
robe
ease
rouse
up
sirs
give
your
brains
a
racking
to
find
the
remedy
we
lacking
or
sure
as
fate
we
send
you
packing
at
this
the
mayor
and
corporation
quaked
with
a
mighty
consternation
iv
an
hour
they
sat
in
council
at
length
the
mayor
broke
silence
for
a
guilder
i
my
ermine
gown
sell
i
wish
i
were
a
mile
hence
it
easy
to
bid
one
rack
one
brain
i
sure
my
poor
head
aches
again
i
scratched
it
so
and
all
in
vain
oh
for
a
trap
a
trap
a
trap
just
as
he
said
this
what
should
hap
at
the
chamber
door
but
a
gentle
tap
bless
us
cried
the
mayor
what
that
with
the
corporation
as
he
sat
looking
little
though
wondrous
fat
nor
brighter
was
his
eye
nor
moister
than
a
oyster
save
when
at
noon
his
paunch
grew
mutinous
for
a
plate
of
turtle
green
and
glutinous
only
a
scraping
of
shoes
on
the
mat
anything
like
the
sound
of
a
rat
makes
my
heart
go
v
come
in
the
mayor
cried
looking
bigger
and
in
did
come
the
strangest
figure
his
queer
long
coat
from
heel
to
head
was
half
of
yellow
and
half
of
red
and
he
himself
was
tall
and
thin
with
sharp
blue
eyes
each
like
a
pin
and
light
loose
hair
yet
swarthy
skin
no
tuft
on
cheek
nor
beard
on
chin
but
lips
where
smiles
went
out
and
in
there
was
no
guessing
his
kith
and
kin
and
nobody
could
enough
admire
the
tall
man
and
his
quaint
attire
quoth
one
it
as
my
starting
up
at
the
trump
of
doom
tone
had
walked
this
way
from
his
painted
tombstone
vi
he
advanced
to
the
and
please
your
honors
said
he
i
able
by
means
of
a
secret
charm
to
draw
all
creatures
living
beneath
the
sun
that
creep
or
swim
or
fly
or
run
after
me
so
as
you
never
saw
and
i
chiefly
use
my
charm
on
creatures
that
do
people
harm
the
mole
and
toad
and
newt
and
viper
and
people
call
me
the
pied
piper
and
here
they
noticed
round
his
neck
a
scarf
of
red
and
yellow
stripe
to
match
with
his
coat
of
the
check
and
at
the
scarf
end
hung
a
pipe
and
his
fingers
they
noticed
were
ever
straying
as
if
impatient
to
be
playing
upon
this
pipe
as
low
it
dangled
over
his
vesture
so
yet
said
he
poor
piper
as
i
am
in
tartary
i
freed
the
cham
last
june
from
his
huge
swarms
of
gnats
i
eased
in
asia
the
nizam
of
a
monstrous
brood
of
and
as
for
what
your
brain
bewilders
if
i
can
rid
your
town
of
rats
will
you
give
me
a
thousand
guilders
one
fifty
thousand
was
the
exclamation
of
the
astonished
mayor
and
corporation
vii
into
the
street
the
piper
stepped
smiling
first
a
little
smile
as
if
he
knew
what
magic
slept
in
his
quiet
pipe
the
while
then
like
a
musical
adept
to
blow
the
pipe
his
lips
he
wrinkled
and
green
and
blue
his
sharp
eyes
twinkled
like
a
where
salt
is
sprinkled
and
ere
three
shrill
notes
the
pipe
uttered
you
heard
as
if
an
army
muttered
and
the
muttering
grew
to
a
grumbling
and
the
grumbling
grew
to
a
mighty
rumbling
and
out
of
the
houses
the
rats
came
tumbling
great
rats
small
rats
lean
rats
brawny
rats
brown
rats
black
rats
gray
rats
tawny
rats
grave
old
plodders
gay
young
friskers
fathers
mothers
uncles
cousins
cocking
tails
and
pricking
whiskers
families
by
tens
and
dozens
brothers
sisters
husbands
wives
followed
the
piper
for
their
lives
from
street
to
street
he
piped
advancing
and
step
for
step
they
followed
dancing
until
they
came
to
the
river
weser
wherein
all
plunged
and
perished
save
one
who
stout
as
julius
cæsar
swam
across
and
lived
to
carry
as
he
the
manuscript
he
cherished
to
home
his
commentary
which
was
at
the
first
shrill
notes
of
the
pipe
i
heard
a
sound
as
of
scraping
tripe
and
putting
apples
wondrous
ripe
into
a
gripe
and
a
moving
away
of
and
a
leaving
ajar
of
and
a
drawing
the
corks
of
and
a
breaking
the
hoops
of
and
it
seemed
as
if
a
voice
sweeter
far
than
by
harp
or
by
psaltery
is
breathed
called
out
rats
rejoice
the
world
is
grown
to
one
vast
drysaltery
so
munch
on
crunch
on
take
your
nuncheon
breakfast
supper
dinner
luncheon
and
just
as
a
bulky
all
ready
staved
like
a
great
sun
shone
glorious
scarce
an
inch
before
me
just
as
methought
it
said
bore
me
i
found
the
weser
rolling
me
viii
you
should
have
heard
the
hamelin
people
ringing
the
bells
till
they
rocked
the
steeple
go
cried
the
mayor
and
get
long
poles
poke
out
the
nests
and
block
up
the
holes
consult
with
carpenters
and
builders
and
leave
in
our
town
not
even
a
trace
of
the
rats
when
suddenly
up
the
face
of
the
piper
perked
in
the
with
a
first
if
you
please
my
thousand
guilders
ix
a
thousand
guilders
the
mayor
looked
blue
so
did
the
corporation
too
for
council
dinners
made
rare
havoc
with
claret
moselle
hock
and
half
the
money
would
replenish
their
cellar
biggest
butt
with
rhenish
to
pay
this
sum
to
a
wandering
fellow
with
a
gypsy
coat
of
red
and
yellow
beside
quoth
the
mayor
with
a
knowing
wink
our
business
was
done
at
the
river
brink
we
saw
with
our
eyes
the
vermin
sink
and
what
dead
ca
come
to
life
i
think
so
friend
we
not
the
folks
to
shrink
from
the
duty
of
giving
you
something
for
drink
and
a
matter
of
money
to
put
in
your
poke
but
as
for
the
guilders
what
we
spoke
of
them
as
you
very
well
know
was
in
joke
beside
our
losses
have
made
us
thrifty
a
thousand
guilders
come
take
fifty
x
the
piper
face
fell
and
he
cried
no
trifling
i
ca
wait
beside
i
promised
to
visit
by
dinner
time
bagdat
and
accept
the
prime
of
the
pottage
all
he
rich
in
for
having
left
in
the
caliph
kitchen
of
a
nest
of
scorpions
no
survivor
with
him
i
proved
no
with
you
do
think
i
bate
a
stiver
and
folks
who
put
me
in
a
passion
may
find
me
pipe
after
another
fashion
xi
how
cried
the
mayor
d
think
i
brook
being
worse
treated
than
a
cook
insulted
by
a
lazy
ribald
with
idle
pipe
and
vesture
piebald
you
threaten
us
fellow
do
your
worst
blow
your
pipe
there
till
you
burst
xii
once
more
he
stepped
into
the
street
and
to
his
lips
again
laid
his
long
pipe
of
smooth
straight
cane
and
ere
he
blew
three
notes
such
sweet
soft
notes
as
yet
musician
cunning
never
gave
the
enraptured
air
there
was
a
rustling
that
seemed
like
a
bustling
of
merry
crowds
justling
at
pitching
and
hustling
small
feet
were
pattering
wooden
shoes
clattering
little
hands
clapping
and
little
tongues
chattering
and
like
fowls
in
a
when
barley
is
scattering
out
came
the
children
running
all
the
little
boys
and
girls
with
rosy
cheeks
and
flaxen
curls
and
sparkling
eyes
and
teeth
like
pearls
tripping
and
skipping
ran
merrily
after
the
wonderful
music
with
shouting
and
laughter
xiii
the
mayor
was
dumb
and
the
council
stood
as
if
they
were
changed
into
blocks
of
wood
unable
to
move
a
step
or
cry
to
the
children
merrily
skipping
by
could
only
follow
with
the
eye
that
joyous
crowd
at
the
piper
back
but
how
the
mayor
was
on
the
rack
and
the
wretched
council
bosoms
beat
as
the
piper
turned
from
the
high
street
to
where
the
weser
rolled
its
waters
right
in
the
way
of
their
sons
and
daughters
however
he
turned
from
south
to
west
and
to
koppelberg
hill
his
steps
addressed
and
after
him
the
children
pressed
great
was
the
joy
in
every
breast
he
never
can
cross
that
mighty
top
he
forced
to
let
the
piping
drop
and
we
shall
see
our
children
stop
when
lo
as
they
reached
the
a
wondrous
portal
opened
wide
as
if
a
cavern
was
suddenly
hollowed
and
the
piper
advanced
and
the
children
followed
and
when
all
were
in
to
the
very
last
the
door
in
the
shut
fast
did
i
say
all
no
one
was
lame
and
could
not
dance
the
whole
of
the
way
and
in
after
years
if
you
would
blame
his
sadness
he
was
used
to
say
it
dull
in
our
town
since
my
playmates
left
i
ca
forget
that
i
bereft
of
all
the
pleasant
sights
they
see
which
the
piper
also
promised
me
for
he
led
us
he
said
to
a
joyous
land
joining
the
town
and
just
at
hand
where
waters
gushed
and
grew
and
flowers
put
forth
a
fairer
hue
and
everything
was
strange
and
new
the
sparrows
were
brighter
than
peacocks
here
and
their
dogs
outran
our
fallow
deer
and
had
lost
their
stings
and
horses
were
born
with
eagles
wings
and
just
as
i
became
assured
my
lame
foot
would
be
speedily
cured
the
music
stopped
and
i
stood
still
and
found
myself
outside
the
hill
left
alone
against
my
will
to
go
now
limping
as
before
and
never
hear
of
that
country
more
xiv
alas
alas
for
hamelin
there
came
into
many
a
burgher
pate
a
text
which
says
that
heaven
gate
opes
to
the
rich
at
as
easy
rate
as
the
needle
eye
takes
a
camel
in
the
mayor
sent
east
west
north
and
south
to
offer
the
piper
by
word
of
mouth
wherever
it
was
men
lot
to
find
him
silver
and
gold
to
his
heart
content
if
he
only
return
the
way
he
went
and
bring
the
children
behind
him
but
when
they
saw
was
a
lost
endeavor
and
piper
and
dancers
were
gone
forever
they
made
a
decree
that
lawyers
never
should
think
their
records
dated
duly
if
after
the
day
of
the
month
and
year
these
words
did
not
as
well
appear
and
so
long
after
what
happened
here
on
the
of
july
thirteen
hundred
and
and
the
better
in
memory
to
fix
the
place
of
the
children
last
retreat
they
called
it
the
pied
piper
street
where
anyone
playing
on
pipe
or
tabor
was
sure
for
the
future
to
lose
his
labor
nor
suffered
they
hostelry
or
tavern
to
shock
with
mirth
a
street
so
solemn
but
opposite
the
place
of
the
cavern
they
wrote
the
story
on
a
column
and
on
the
great
painted
the
same
to
make
the
world
acquainted
how
their
children
were
stolen
away
and
there
it
stands
to
this
very
day
and
i
must
not
omit
to
say
that
in
transylvania
there
a
tribe
of
alien
people
who
ascribe
the
outlandish
ways
and
dress
on
which
their
neighbors
lay
such
stress
to
their
fathers
and
mothers
having
risen
out
of
some
subterraneous
prison
into
which
they
were
trepanned
long
time
ago
in
a
mighty
band
out
of
hamelin
town
in
brunswick
land
but
how
or
why
they
do
understand
xv
so
willy
let
me
and
you
be
wipers
of
scores
out
with
all
men
especially
pipers
and
whether
they
pipe
us
free
from
rats
or
from
mice
if
we
promised
them
aught
let
us
keep
our
promise
the
flight
of
the
duchess
i
you
my
friend
i
was
the
man
the
duke
spoke
to
i
helped
the
duchess
to
cast
off
his
yoke
too
so
here
the
tale
from
beginning
to
end
my
friend
ii
ours
is
a
great
wild
country
if
you
climb
to
our
castle
top
i
do
see
where
your
eye
can
stop
for
when
you
passed
the
cornfield
country
where
vineyards
leave
off
flocks
are
packed
and
leads
to
and
to
and
to
the
very
base
of
the
mountain
where
at
a
funeral
pace
round
about
solemn
and
slow
one
by
one
row
after
row
up
and
up
the
go
so
like
black
priests
up
and
so
down
the
other
side
again
to
another
greater
wilder
country
that
one
vast
red
drear
plain
branched
through
and
through
with
many
a
vein
whence
iron
dug
and
copper
dealt
look
right
look
left
look
straight
before
beneath
they
mine
above
they
smelt
and
and
forge
and
furnace
mold
and
melt
and
so
on
more
and
ever
more
till
at
the
last
for
a
bounding
belt
comes
the
salt
sand
hoar
of
the
great
seashore
and
the
whole
is
our
duke
country
iii
i
was
born
the
day
this
present
duke
was
and
o
says
the
song
ere
i
was
old
in
the
castle
where
the
other
duke
was
when
i
was
happy
and
young
not
old
i
in
the
kennel
he
in
the
bower
we
are
of
like
age
to
an
hour
my
father
was
huntsman
in
that
day
who
has
not
heard
my
father
say
that
when
a
boar
was
brought
to
bay
three
times
four
times
out
of
five
with
his
huntspear
he
contrive
to
get
the
transfixed
and
pin
him
true
both
eyes
betwixt
and
that
why
the
old
duke
would
rather
he
lost
a
than
my
father
and
loved
to
have
him
ever
in
call
that
why
my
father
stood
in
the
hall
when
the
old
duke
brought
his
infant
out
to
show
the
people
and
while
they
passed
the
wondrous
bantling
round
about
was
first
to
start
at
the
outside
blast
as
the
kaiser
courier
blew
his
horn
just
a
month
after
the
babe
was
born
and
quoth
the
kaiser
courier
since
the
duke
has
got
an
heir
our
prince
needs
the
duke
self
at
his
side
the
duke
looked
down
and
seemed
to
wince
but
he
thought
of
wars
the
world
wide
castles
men
on
their
march
the
toppling
tower
the
crashing
arch
and
up
he
looked
and
awhile
he
eyed
the
row
of
crests
and
shields
and
banners
of
all
achievements
after
all
manners
and
aye
said
the
duke
with
a
surly
pride
the
more
was
his
comfort
when
he
died
at
next
year
end
in
a
velvet
suit
with
a
gilt
glove
on
his
hand
his
foot
in
a
silken
shoe
for
a
leather
boot
petticoated
like
a
herald
in
a
chamber
next
to
an
where
he
breathed
the
breath
of
page
and
groom
what
he
called
stink
and
they
perfume
they
should
have
set
him
on
red
berold
mad
with
pride
like
fire
to
manage
they
should
have
got
his
cheek
fresh
tannage
such
a
day
as
today
in
the
merry
sunshine
had
they
stuck
on
his
fist
a
merlin
hark
the
wind
on
the
heath
at
its
game
oh
for
a
noble
to
flap
each
broad
wing
like
a
banner
and
turn
in
the
wind
and
dance
like
flame
had
they
broached
a
cask
from
berlin
or
if
you
incline
to
prescribe
mere
wine
put
to
his
lips
when
they
saw
him
pine
a
cup
of
our
own
moldavia
fine
cotnar
for
instance
green
as
may
sorrel
and
ropy
with
sweet
we
shall
not
quarrel
iv
so
at
home
the
sick
tall
yellow
duchess
was
left
with
the
infant
in
her
clutches
she
being
the
daughter
of
god
knows
who
and
now
was
the
time
to
revisit
her
tribe
abroad
and
afar
they
went
the
two
and
let
our
people
rail
and
gibe
at
the
empty
hall
and
extinguished
fire
as
loud
as
we
liked
but
ever
in
vain
till
after
long
years
we
had
our
desire
and
back
came
the
duke
and
his
mother
again
v
and
he
came
back
the
pertest
little
ape
that
ever
affronted
human
shape
full
of
his
travel
struck
at
himself
you
say
he
despised
our
bluff
old
ways
not
he
for
in
paris
they
told
the
elf
our
rough
north
land
was
the
land
of
lays
the
one
good
thing
left
in
evil
days
since
the
was
the
heroic
time
and
only
in
wild
nooks
like
ours
could
you
taste
of
it
yet
as
in
its
prime
and
see
true
castles
with
proper
towers
women
men
and
manners
now
as
manners
were
then
so
all
that
the
old
dukes
had
been
without
knowing
it
this
duke
would
fain
know
he
was
without
being
it
was
not
for
the
joy
self
but
the
joy
of
his
showing
it
nor
for
the
pride
self
but
the
pride
of
our
seeing
it
he
revived
all
usages
thoroughly
the
souls
of
them
the
hearts
of
them
and
chief
in
the
chase
his
neck
he
periled
on
a
lathy
horse
all
legs
and
length
with
blood
for
bone
all
speed
no
strength
they
should
have
set
him
on
red
berold
with
the
red
eye
slow
consuming
in
fire
and
the
thin
stiff
ear
like
an
vi
well
such
as
he
was
he
must
marry
we
heard
and
out
of
a
convent
at
the
word
came
the
lady
in
time
of
spring
oh
old
thoughts
they
cling
they
cling
that
day
i
know
with
a
dozen
oaths
i
clad
myself
in
thick
fit
for
the
chase
of
urochs
or
buffle
in
when
you
need
to
muffle
but
the
duke
had
a
mind
we
should
cut
a
figure
and
so
we
saw
the
lady
arrive
my
friend
i
have
seen
a
white
crane
bigger
she
was
the
smallest
lady
alive
made
in
a
piece
of
nature
madness
too
small
almost
for
the
life
and
gladness
that
overfilled
her
as
some
hive
out
of
the
bears
reach
on
the
high
trees
is
crowded
with
its
safe
merry
bees
in
truth
she
was
not
hard
to
please
up
she
looked
down
she
looked
round
at
the
mead
straight
at
the
castle
that
best
indeed
to
look
at
from
outside
the
walls
as
for
us
styled
the
serfs
and
thralls
she
as
much
thanked
me
as
if
she
had
said
it
with
her
eyes
do
you
understand
because
i
patted
her
horse
while
i
led
it
and
max
who
rode
on
her
other
hand
said
no
bird
flew
past
but
she
inquired
what
its
true
name
was
nor
ever
seemed
tired
if
that
was
an
eagle
she
saw
hover
and
the
green
and
gray
bird
on
the
field
was
the
plover
when
suddenly
appeared
the
duke
and
as
down
she
sprung
the
small
foot
pointed
on
to
my
hand
as
with
a
rebuke
and
as
if
his
backbone
were
not
jointed
the
duke
stepped
rather
aside
than
forward
and
welcomed
her
with
his
grandest
smile
and
mind
you
his
mother
all
the
while
chilled
in
the
rear
like
a
wind
to
and
up
like
a
weary
yawn
with
its
pulleys
went
in
a
shriek
the
rusty
portcullis
and
like
a
glad
sky
the
sullies
the
lady
face
stopped
its
play
as
if
her
first
hair
had
grown
gray
for
such
things
must
begin
some
one
day
vii
in
a
day
or
two
she
was
well
again
as
who
should
say
you
labor
in
vain
this
is
all
a
jest
against
god
who
meant
i
should
ever
be
as
i
am
content
and
glad
in
his
sight
therefore
glad
i
will
be
so
smiling
as
at
first
went
she
viii
she
was
active
stirring
all
fire
could
not
rest
could
not
tire
to
a
stone
she
might
have
given
life
i
myself
loved
once
in
my
day
for
a
shepherd
miner
huntsman
wife
i
had
a
wife
i
know
what
i
say
never
in
all
the
world
such
an
one
and
here
was
plenty
to
be
done
and
she
that
could
do
it
great
or
small
she
was
to
do
nothing
at
all
there
was
already
this
man
in
his
post
this
in
his
station
and
that
in
his
office
and
the
duke
plan
admitted
a
wife
at
most
to
meet
his
eye
with
the
other
trophies
now
outside
the
hall
now
in
it
to
sit
thus
stand
thus
see
and
be
seen
at
the
proper
place
in
the
proper
minute
and
die
away
the
life
between
and
it
was
amusing
enough
each
infraction
of
rule
but
for
that
came
to
hear
the
consummate
with
which
the
young
duke
and
the
old
dame
would
let
her
advise
and
criticize
and
being
a
fool
instruct
the
wise
and
parcel
out
praise
or
blame
they
bore
it
all
in
complacent
guise
as
though
an
artificer
after
contriving
a
image
as
if
it
were
living
should
find
with
delight
it
could
motion
to
strike
him
so
found
the
duke
and
his
mother
like
him
the
lady
hardly
got
a
rebuff
that
had
not
been
contemptuous
enough
with
his
cursed
smirk
as
he
nodded
applause
and
kept
off
the
old
claws
ix
so
the
little
lady
grew
silent
and
thin
paling
and
ever
paling
as
the
way
is
with
a
hid
chagrin
and
the
duke
perceived
that
she
was
ailing
and
said
in
his
heart
is
done
to
spite
me
but
i
shall
find
in
my
power
to
right
me
do
swear
friend
the
old
one
many
a
year
is
in
hell
and
the
duke
self
you
shall
hear
x
well
early
in
autumn
at
first
when
the
stag
had
to
break
with
his
foot
of
a
morning
a
out
of
the
fresh
tender
ice
that
covered
the
pond
till
the
sun
in
a
trice
loosening
it
let
out
a
ripple
of
gold
and
another
and
another
and
faster
and
faster
till
dimpling
to
blindness
the
wide
water
rolled
then
it
so
chanced
that
the
duke
our
master
asked
himself
what
were
the
pleasures
in
season
and
found
since
the
calendar
bade
him
be
hearty
he
should
do
the
middle
age
no
treason
in
resolving
on
a
always
provided
old
books
showed
the
way
of
it
what
meant
old
poets
by
their
strictures
and
when
old
poets
had
said
their
say
of
it
how
taught
old
painters
in
their
pictures
we
must
revert
to
the
proper
channels
workings
in
tapestry
paintings
on
panels
and
gather
up
woodcraft
authentic
traditions
here
was
food
for
our
various
ambitions
as
on
each
case
exactly
stated
to
encourage
your
dog
now
the
properest
chirrup
or
best
prayer
to
saint
hubert
on
mounting
your
stirrup
we
of
the
household
took
thought
and
debated
blessed
was
he
whose
back
ached
with
the
jerkin
his
sire
was
wont
to
do
in
blesseder
he
who
nobly
sunk
ohs
and
ahs
while
he
tugged
on
his
grandsire
what
signified
hats
if
they
had
no
rims
on
each
slouching
before
and
behind
like
the
scallop
and
able
to
serve
at
sea
for
a
shallop
loaded
with
lacquer
and
looped
with
crimson
so
that
the
deer
now
to
make
a
short
rhyme
o
what
with
our
venerers
prickers
and
verderers
might
hope
for
real
hunters
at
length
and
not
murderers
and
oh
the
duke
tailor
he
had
a
hot
time
o
xi
now
you
must
know
that
when
the
first
dizziness
of
and
and
subsided
the
duke
put
this
question
the
duke
part
provided
had
not
the
duchess
some
share
in
the
business
for
out
of
the
mouth
of
two
or
three
witnesses
did
he
establish
all
and
after
much
laying
of
heads
together
somebody
cap
got
a
notable
feather
by
the
announcement
with
proper
unction
that
he
had
discovered
the
lady
function
since
ancient
authors
gave
this
tenet
when
horns
wind
a
mort
and
the
deer
is
at
siege
let
the
dame
of
the
castle
prick
forth
on
her
jennet
and
with
water
to
wash
the
hands
of
her
liege
in
a
clean
ewer
with
a
fair
toweling
let
her
preside
at
the
disemboweling
now
my
friend
if
you
had
so
little
religion
as
to
catch
a
hawk
some
and
thrust
her
broad
wings
like
a
banner
into
a
coop
for
a
vulgar
pigeon
and
if
day
by
day
and
week
by
week
you
cut
her
claws
and
sealed
her
eyes
and
clipped
her
wings
and
tied
her
beak
would
it
cause
you
any
great
surprise
if
when
you
decided
to
give
her
an
airing
you
found
she
needed
a
little
preparing
i
say
should
you
be
such
a
curmudgeon
if
she
clung
to
the
perch
as
to
take
it
in
dudgeon
yet
when
the
duke
to
his
lady
signified
just
a
day
before
as
he
judged
most
dignified
in
what
a
pleasure
she
was
to
participate
and
instead
of
leaping
wide
in
flashes
her
eyes
just
lifted
their
long
lashes
as
if
pressed
by
fatigue
even
he
could
not
dissipate
and
duly
acknowledged
the
duke
forethought
but
spoke
of
her
health
if
her
health
were
worth
aught
of
the
weight
by
day
and
the
watch
by
night
and
much
wrong
now
that
used
to
be
right
so
thanking
him
declined
the
hunting
was
conduct
ever
more
affronting
with
all
the
ceremony
settled
with
the
towel
ready
and
the
sewer
polishing
up
his
oldest
ewer
and
the
jennet
pitched
upon
a
piebald
and
pink
no
wonder
if
the
duke
was
nettled
and
when
she
persisted
nevertheless
well
i
suppose
here
the
time
to
confess
that
there
ran
half
round
our
lady
chamber
a
balcony
none
of
the
hardest
to
clamber
and
that
jacynth
the
ready
in
waiting
stayed
in
call
outside
what
need
of
relating
and
since
jacynth
was
like
a
june
rose
why
a
fervent
adorer
of
jacynth
of
course
was
your
servant
and
if
she
had
the
habit
to
peep
through
the
casement
how
could
i
keep
at
any
vast
distance
and
so
as
i
say
on
the
lady
persistence
the
duke
with
amazement
stood
for
a
while
in
a
sultry
smother
and
then
with
a
smile
that
partook
of
the
awful
turned
her
over
to
his
yellow
mother
to
learn
what
was
held
decorous
and
lawful
and
the
mother
smelt
blood
with
a
instinct
as
her
cheek
quick
whitened
through
all
its
oh
but
the
lady
heard
the
whole
truth
at
once
what
meant
she
who
was
she
her
duty
and
station
the
wisdom
of
age
and
the
folly
of
youth
at
once
its
decent
regard
and
its
fitting
relation
in
brief
my
friend
set
all
the
devils
in
hell
free
and
turn
them
out
to
carouse
in
a
belfry
and
treat
the
priests
to
a
canon
and
then
you
may
guess
how
that
tongue
of
hers
ran
on
well
somehow
or
other
it
ended
at
last
and
licking
her
whiskers
out
she
passed
and
after
her
making
he
hoped
a
face
like
emperor
nero
or
sultan
saladin
stalked
the
duke
self
with
the
austere
grace
of
ancient
hero
or
modern
paladin
from
door
to
staircase
oh
such
a
solemn
unbending
of
the
vertebral
column
xii
however
at
sunrise
our
company
mustered
and
here
was
the
huntsman
bidding
unkennel
and
there
his
bonnet
the
pricker
blustered
with
feather
dank
as
a
bough
of
wet
fennel
for
the
courtyard
walls
were
filled
with
fog
you
might
have
cut
as
an
ax
chops
a
log
like
so
much
wool
for
color
and
bulkiness
and
out
rode
the
duke
in
a
perfect
sulkiness
since
before
breakfast
a
man
feels
but
queasily
and
a
sinking
at
the
lower
abdomen
begins
the
day
with
indifferent
omen
and
lo
as
he
looked
around
uneasily
the
sun
plowed
the
fog
up
and
drove
it
asunder
this
way
and
that
from
the
valley
under
and
looking
through
the
arch
down
in
the
valley
what
should
meet
him
but
a
troop
of
gypsies
on
their
march
no
doubt
with
the
annual
gifts
to
greet
him
xiii
now
in
your
land
gypsies
reach
you
only
after
reaching
all
lands
beside
north
they
go
south
they
go
trooping
or
lonely
and
still
as
they
travel
far
and
wide
catch
they
and
keep
now
a
trace
here
a
trace
there
that
puts
you
in
mind
of
a
place
here
a
place
there
but
with
us
i
believe
they
rise
out
of
the
ground
and
nowhere
else
i
take
it
are
found
with
the
yet
so
freshly
embrowned
born
no
doubt
like
insects
which
breed
on
the
very
fruit
they
are
meant
to
feed
on
for
the
earth
not
a
use
to
which
they
do
turn
it
the
ore
that
grows
in
the
mountain
womb
or
the
sand
in
the
pits
like
a
honeycomb
they
sift
and
soften
it
bake
it
and
burn
it
whether
they
weld
you
for
instance
a
snaffle
with
never
a
brute
can
baffle
or
a
lock
that
a
puzzle
of
wards
within
wards
or
if
your
colt
forefoot
inclines
to
curve
inwards
horseshoes
they
hammer
which
turn
on
a
swivel
and
wo
allow
the
hoof
to
shrivel
then
they
cast
bells
like
the
shell
of
the
winkle
that
keep
a
stout
heart
in
the
ram
with
their
tinkle
but
the
sand
they
pinch
and
pound
it
like
otters
commend
me
the
gypsy
and
potters
glasses
they
blow
you
where
just
a
faint
cloud
of
rose
shall
appear
as
if
in
pure
water
you
dropped
and
let
die
a
bruised
mulberry
and
that
other
sort
their
crowning
pride
with
long
white
threads
distinct
inside
like
the
fibrous
roots
which
dangle
loose
such
a
length
and
never
tangle
where
the
bold
cuts
the
clear
waters
and
the
couches
with
all
the
white
daughters
such
are
the
works
they
put
their
hand
to
the
uses
they
turn
and
twist
iron
and
sand
to
and
these
made
the
troop
which
our
duke
saw
sally
toward
his
castle
from
out
of
the
valley
men
and
women
like
spiders
come
out
with
the
morning
to
greet
our
riders
and
up
they
wound
till
they
reached
the
ditch
whereat
all
stopped
save
one
a
witch
that
i
knew
as
she
hobbled
from
the
group
by
her
gait
directly
and
her
stoop
i
whom
jacynth
was
used
to
importune
to
let
that
same
witch
tell
us
our
fortune
the
oldest
gypsy
then
above
ground
and
sure
as
the
autumn
season
came
round
she
paid
us
a
visit
for
profit
or
pastime
and
every
time
as
she
swore
for
the
last
time
and
presently
she
was
seen
to
sidle
up
to
the
duke
till
she
touched
his
bridle
so
that
the
horse
of
a
sudden
reared
up
as
under
its
nose
the
old
witch
peered
up
with
her
eyes
or
rather
of
no
use
now
but
to
gather
brine
and
began
a
kind
of
level
whine
such
as
they
used
to
sing
to
their
viols
when
their
ditties
they
go
grinding
up
and
down
with
nobody
minding
and
then
as
of
old
at
the
end
of
the
humming
her
usual
presents
were
forthcoming
a
blowing
the
fiercest
of
trebles
just
a
seashore
stone
holding
a
dozen
fine
pebbles
or
a
porcelain
mouthpiece
to
screw
on
a
and
so
she
awaited
her
annual
stipend
but
this
time
the
duke
would
scarcely
vouchsafe
a
word
in
reply
and
in
vain
she
felt
with
twitching
fingers
at
her
belt
for
the
purse
of
sleek
pelt
ready
to
put
what
he
gave
in
her
pouch
safe
till
either
to
quicken
his
apprehension
or
possibly
with
an
she
was
come
she
said
to
pay
her
duty
to
the
new
duchess
the
youthful
beauty
no
sooner
had
she
named
his
lady
than
a
shine
lit
up
the
face
so
shady
and
its
smirk
returned
with
a
novel
meaning
for
it
struck
him
the
babe
just
wanted
weaning
if
one
gave
her
a
taste
of
what
life
was
and
sorrow
she
foolish
today
would
be
wiser
tomorrow
and
who
so
fit
a
teacher
of
trouble
as
this
sordid
crone
bent
double
so
glancing
at
her
vesture
if
such
it
was
for
they
grow
so
hirsute
that
their
own
fleece
serves
for
natural
he
was
contrasting
was
plain
from
his
gesture
the
life
of
the
lady
so
and
delicate
with
the
loathsome
squalor
of
this
helicat
i
in
brief
was
the
man
the
duke
beckoned
from
out
of
the
throng
and
while
i
drew
near
he
told
the
crone
as
i
since
have
reckoned
by
the
way
he
bent
and
spoke
into
her
ear
with
circumspection
and
mystery
the
main
of
the
lady
history
her
frowardness
and
ingratitude
and
for
all
the
crone
submissive
attitude
i
could
see
round
her
mouth
the
loose
plaits
tightening
and
her
brow
with
assenting
intelligence
brightening
as
though
she
engaged
with
hearty
goodwill
whatever
he
now
might
enjoin
to
fulfill
and
promised
the
lady
a
thorough
frightening
and
so
just
giving
her
a
glimpse
of
a
purse
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
imps
the
wing
of
the
hawk
that
shall
fetch
the
hernshaw
he
bade
me
take
the
gypsy
mother
and
set
her
telling
some
story
or
other
of
hill
or
dale
or
fernshaw
to
wile
away
a
weary
hour
for
the
lady
left
alone
in
her
bower
whose
mind
and
body
craved
exertion
and
yet
shrank
from
all
better
diversion
xiv
then
clapping
heel
to
his
horse
the
mere
curveter
out
rode
the
duke
and
after
his
hollo
horses
and
hounds
swept
huntsman
and
servitor
and
back
i
turned
and
bade
the
crone
follow
and
what
makes
me
confident
what
to
be
told
you
had
all
along
been
of
this
crone
devising
is
that
on
looking
round
sharply
behold
you
there
was
a
novelty
quick
as
surprising
for
first
she
had
shot
up
a
full
head
in
stature
and
her
step
kept
pace
with
mine
nor
faltered
as
if
age
had
foregone
its
usurpature
and
the
ignoble
mien
was
wholly
altered
and
the
face
looked
quite
of
another
nature
and
the
change
reached
too
whatever
the
change
meant
her
shaggy
cloak
arrangement
for
where
its
tatters
hung
loose
like
sedges
gold
coins
were
glittering
on
the
edges
like
the
strung
with
tomans
which
proves
the
veil
a
persian
woman
and
under
her
brow
like
a
snail
horns
newly
come
out
as
after
the
rain
he
paces
two
unmistakable
duly
live
and
aware
looked
out
of
their
places
so
we
went
and
found
jacynth
at
the
entry
of
the
lady
chamber
standing
sentry
i
told
the
command
and
produced
my
companion
and
jacynth
rejoiced
to
admit
anyone
for
since
last
night
by
the
same
token
not
a
single
word
had
the
lady
spoken
they
went
in
both
to
the
presence
together
while
i
in
the
balcony
watched
the
weather
xv
and
now
what
took
place
at
the
very
first
of
all
i
can
not
tell
as
i
never
could
learn
it
jacynth
constantly
wished
a
curse
to
fall
on
that
little
head
of
hers
and
burn
it
if
she
knew
how
she
came
to
drop
so
soundly
asleep
of
a
sudden
and
there
continue
the
whole
time
sleeping
as
profoundly
as
one
of
the
boars
my
father
would
pin
you
the
eyes
where
life
holds
garrison
jacynth
forgive
me
the
comparison
but
where
i
begin
my
own
narration
is
a
little
after
i
took
my
station
to
breathe
the
fresh
air
from
the
balcony
and
having
in
those
days
a
falcon
eye
to
follow
the
hunt
through
the
open
country
from
where
the
bushes
thinlier
crested
the
hillocks
to
a
plain
where
not
one
tree
when
in
a
moment
my
ear
was
arrested
by
was
it
singing
or
was
it
saying
or
a
strange
musical
instrument
playing
in
the
chamber
and
to
be
certain
i
pushed
the
lattice
pulled
the
curtain
and
there
lay
jacynth
asleep
yet
as
if
a
watch
she
tried
to
keep
in
a
rosy
sleep
along
the
floor
with
her
head
against
the
door
while
in
the
midst
on
the
seat
of
state
was
a
queen
the
gypsy
woman
late
with
head
and
face
downbent
on
the
lady
head
and
face
intent
for
coiled
at
her
feet
like
a
child
at
ease
the
lady
sat
between
her
knees
and
them
the
lady
clasped
hands
met
and
on
those
hands
her
chin
was
set
and
her
upturned
face
met
the
face
of
the
crone
wherein
the
eyes
had
grown
and
grown
as
if
she
could
double
and
quadruple
at
pleasure
the
play
of
either
pupil
very
like
by
her
hands
slow
fanning
as
up
and
down
like
a
flappers
they
moved
to
measure
or
i
said
is
it
blessing
is
it
banning
do
they
applaud
you
or
burlesque
you
those
hands
and
fingers
with
no
flesh
on
but
just
as
i
thought
to
spring
in
to
the
rescue
at
once
i
was
stopped
by
the
lady
expression
for
it
was
life
her
eyes
were
drinking
from
the
crone
wide
pair
above
unwinking
life
pure
fire
received
without
shrinking
into
the
heart
and
breast
whose
heaving
told
you
no
single
drop
they
were
leaving
life
that
filling
her
passed
redundant
into
her
very
hair
back
swerving
over
each
shoulder
loose
and
abundant
as
her
head
thrown
back
showed
the
white
throat
curving
and
the
very
tresses
shared
in
the
pleasure
moving
to
the
mystic
measure
bounding
as
the
bosom
bounded
i
stopped
short
more
and
more
confounded
as
still
her
cheeks
burned
and
eyes
glistened
as
she
listened
and
she
listened
when
all
at
once
a
hand
detained
me
the
selfsame
contagion
gained
me
and
i
kept
time
to
the
wondrous
chime
making
out
words
and
prose
and
rhyme
till
it
seemed
that
the
music
furled
its
wings
like
a
task
fulfilled
and
dropped
from
under
the
words
it
first
had
propped
and
left
them
midway
in
the
world
word
took
word
as
hand
takes
hand
i
could
hear
at
last
and
understand
and
when
i
held
the
unbroken
thread
the
gypsy
said
and
so
at
last
we
find
my
tribe
and
so
i
set
thee
in
the
midst
and
to
one
and
all
of
them
describe
what
thou
saidst
and
what
thou
didst
our
long
and
terrible
journey
through
and
all
thou
art
ready
to
say
and
do
in
the
trials
that
remain
i
trace
them
the
vein
and
the
other
vein
that
meet
on
thy
brow
and
part
again
making
our
rapid
mystic
mark
and
i
bid
my
people
prove
and
probe
each
eye
profound
and
glorious
globe
till
they
detect
the
kindred
spark
in
those
depths
so
dear
and
dark
like
the
spots
that
snap
and
burst
and
flee
circling
over
the
midnight
sea
and
on
that
round
young
cheek
of
thine
i
make
them
recognize
the
tinge
as
when
of
the
costly
scarlet
wine
they
drip
so
much
as
will
impinge
and
spread
in
a
thinnest
scale
afloat
one
thick
gold
drop
from
the
olive
coat
over
a
silver
plate
whose
sheen
still
through
the
mixture
shall
be
seen
for
so
i
prove
thee
to
one
and
all
fit
when
my
people
ope
their
breast
to
see
the
sign
and
hear
the
call
and
take
the
vow
and
stand
the
test
which
adds
one
more
child
to
the
rest
when
the
breast
is
bare
and
the
arms
are
wide
and
the
world
is
left
outside
for
there
is
probation
to
decree
and
many
and
long
must
the
trials
be
thou
shalt
victoriously
endure
if
that
brow
is
true
and
those
eyes
are
sure
like
a
fierce
assay
of
the
prize
he
dug
from
its
let
once
the
vindicating
ray
leap
out
amid
the
anxious
gloom
and
steel
and
fire
have
done
their
part
and
the
prize
falls
on
its
finder
heart
so
trial
after
trial
past
wilt
thou
fall
at
the
very
last
breathless
half
in
trance
with
the
thrill
of
the
great
deliverance
into
our
arms
forevermore
and
thou
shalt
know
those
arms
once
curled
about
thee
what
we
knew
before
how
love
is
the
only
good
in
the
world
henceforth
be
loved
as
heart
can
love
or
brain
devise
or
hand
approve
stand
up
look
below
it
is
our
life
at
thy
feet
we
throw
to
step
with
into
light
and
joy
not
a
power
of
life
but
we
employ
to
satisfy
thy
nature
want
art
thou
the
tree
that
props
the
plant
or
the
climbing
plant
that
seeks
the
tree
canst
thou
help
us
must
we
help
thee
if
any
two
creatures
grew
into
one
they
would
do
more
than
the
world
has
done
though
each
apart
were
never
so
weak
ye
vainly
through
the
world
should
seek
for
the
knowledge
and
the
might
which
in
such
union
grew
their
right
so
to
approach
at
least
that
end
and
blend
as
much
as
may
be
blend
thee
with
us
or
us
with
thee
as
climbing
plant
or
propping
tree
shall
someone
deck
thee
over
and
down
up
and
about
with
blossoms
and
leaves
fix
his
heart
fruit
for
thy
cling
with
his
soul
as
the
cleaves
die
on
thy
boughs
and
disappear
while
not
a
leaf
of
thine
is
sere
or
is
the
other
fate
in
store
and
art
thou
fitted
to
adore
to
give
thy
wondrous
self
away
and
take
a
stronger
nature
sway
i
foresee
and
could
foretell
thy
future
portion
sure
and
well
but
those
passionate
eyes
speak
true
speak
true
let
them
say
what
thou
shalt
do
only
be
sure
thy
daily
life
in
its
peace
or
in
its
strife
never
shall
be
unobserved
we
pursue
thy
whole
career
and
hope
for
it
or
doubt
or
fear
lo
hast
thou
kept
thy
path
or
swerved
we
are
beside
thee
in
all
thy
ways
with
our
blame
with
our
praise
our
shame
to
feel
our
pride
to
show
glad
angry
but
indifferent
no
whether
it
be
thy
lot
to
go
for
the
good
of
us
all
where
the
haters
meet
in
the
crowded
city
horrible
street
or
thou
step
alone
through
the
morass
where
never
sound
yet
was
save
the
dry
quick
clap
of
the
stork
bill
for
the
air
is
still
and
the
water
still
when
the
blue
breast
of
the
dipping
coot
dives
under
and
all
is
mute
so
at
the
last
shall
come
old
age
decrepit
as
befits
that
stage
how
else
wouldst
thou
retire
apart
with
the
hoarded
memories
of
thy
heart
and
gather
all
to
the
very
least
of
the
fragments
of
life
earlier
feast
let
fall
through
eagerness
to
find
the
crowning
dainties
yet
behind
ponder
on
the
entire
past
laid
together
thus
at
last
when
the
twilight
helps
to
fuse
the
first
fresh
with
the
faded
hues
and
the
outline
of
the
whole
as
round
eve
shades
their
framework
roll
grandly
fronts
for
once
thy
soul
and
then
as
the
dark
a
gleam
of
yet
another
morning
breaks
and
like
the
hand
which
ends
a
dream
death
with
the
might
of
his
sunbeam
touches
the
flesh
and
the
soul
awakes
then
aye
then
indeed
something
would
happen
but
what
for
here
her
voice
changed
like
a
bird
there
grew
more
of
the
music
and
less
of
the
words
had
jacynth
only
been
by
me
to
clap
pen
to
paper
and
put
you
down
every
syllable
with
those
clever
clerkly
fingers
all
i
forgotten
as
well
as
what
lingers
in
this
old
brain
of
mine
that
but
ill
able
to
give
you
even
this
poor
version
of
the
speech
i
spoil
as
it
were
with
stammering
more
fault
of
those
who
had
the
hammering
of
prosody
into
me
and
syntax
and
did
it
not
with
hobnails
but
but
to
return
from
this
excursion
just
do
you
mark
when
the
song
was
sweetest
the
peace
most
deep
and
the
charm
completest
there
came
shall
i
say
a
snap
and
the
charm
vanished
and
my
sense
returned
so
strangely
banished
and
starting
as
from
a
nap
i
knew
the
crone
was
bewitching
my
lady
with
jacynth
asleep
and
but
one
spring
made
i
down
from
the
casement
round
to
the
portal
another
minute
and
i
had
entered
when
the
door
opened
and
more
than
mortal
stood
with
a
face
where
to
my
mind
centered
all
beauties
i
ever
saw
or
shall
see
the
duchess
i
stopped
as
if
struck
by
palsy
she
was
so
different
happy
and
beautiful
i
felt
at
once
that
all
was
best
and
that
i
had
nothing
to
do
for
the
rest
but
wait
her
commands
obey
and
be
dutiful
not
that
in
fact
there
was
any
commanding
i
saw
the
glory
of
her
eye
and
the
brow
height
and
the
breast
expanding
and
i
was
hers
to
live
or
to
die
as
for
finding
what
she
wanted
you
know
god
almighty
granted
such
little
signs
should
serve
wild
creatures
to
tell
one
another
all
their
desires
so
that
each
knows
what
his
friend
requires
and
does
its
bidding
without
teachers
i
preceded
her
the
crone
followed
silent
and
alone
i
spoke
to
her
but
she
merely
jabbered
in
the
old
style
both
her
eyes
had
slunk
back
to
their
pits
her
stature
shrunk
in
short
the
soul
in
its
body
sunk
like
a
blade
sent
home
to
its
scabbard
we
descended
i
preceding
crossed
the
court
with
nobody
heeding
all
the
world
was
at
the
chase
the
courtyard
like
a
the
stable
emptied
of
its
small
fry
i
saddled
myself
the
very
palfrey
i
remember
patting
while
it
carried
her
the
day
she
arrived
and
the
duke
married
her
and
do
you
know
though
it
easy
deceiving
oneself
in
such
matters
i
ca
help
believing
the
lady
had
not
forgotten
it
either
and
knew
the
poor
devil
so
much
beneath
her
would
have
been
only
too
glad
for
her
service
to
dance
on
hot
plowshares
like
a
turk
dervise
but
unable
to
pay
proper
duty
where
owing
it
was
reduced
to
that
pitiful
method
of
showing
it
for
though
the
moment
i
began
setting
his
saddle
on
my
own
nag
of
berold
begetting
not
that
i
meant
to
be
obtrusive
she
stopped
me
while
his
rug
was
shifting
by
a
single
rapid
finger
lifting
and
with
a
gesture
kind
but
conclusive
and
a
little
shake
of
the
head
refused
me
i
say
although
she
never
used
me
yet
when
she
was
mounted
the
gypsy
behind
her
and
i
ventured
to
remind
her
i
suppose
with
a
voice
of
less
steadiness
than
usual
for
my
feeling
exceeded
me
something
to
the
effect
that
i
was
in
readiness
whenever
god
should
please
she
needed
me
then
do
you
know
her
face
looked
down
on
me
with
a
look
that
placed
a
crown
on
me
and
she
felt
in
her
bosom
mark
her
bosom
and
as
a
drops
its
blossom
dropped
me
ah
had
it
been
a
purse
of
silver
my
friend
or
gold
that
worse
why
you
see
as
soon
as
i
found
myself
so
understood
that
a
true
heart
so
may
gain
such
a
reward
i
should
have
gone
home
again
kissed
jacynth
and
soberly
drowned
myself
it
was
a
little
plait
of
hair
such
as
friends
in
a
convent
make
to
wear
each
for
the
other
sake
this
see
which
at
my
breast
i
wear
ever
did
rather
to
jacynth
grudgment
and
ever
shall
till
the
day
of
judgment
and
then
and
then
to
cut
short
this
is
idle
these
are
feelings
it
is
not
good
to
foster
i
pushed
the
gate
wide
she
shook
the
bridle
and
the
palfrey
bounded
and
so
we
lost
her
xvi
when
the
liquor
out
why
clink
the
cannikin
i
did
think
to
describe
you
the
panic
in
the
redoubtable
breast
of
our
master
the
mannikin
and
what
was
the
pitch
of
his
mother
yellowness
how
she
turned
as
a
shark
to
snap
the
clean
off
sailors
says
from
a
carib
when
she
heard
what
she
called
the
flight
of
the
feloness
but
it
seems
such
child
play
what
they
said
and
did
with
the
lady
away
and
to
dance
on
when
we
lost
the
music
always
made
me
and
no
doubt
makes
you
sick
nay
to
my
mind
the
world
face
looked
so
stern
as
that
sweet
form
disappeared
through
the
postern
she
that
kept
it
in
constant
good
humor
it
ought
to
have
stopped
there
seemed
nothing
to
do
more
but
the
world
thought
otherwise
and
went
on
and
my
head
one
that
its
spite
was
spent
on
thirty
years
are
fled
since
that
morning
and
with
them
all
my
head
adorning
nor
did
the
old
duchess
die
outright
as
you
expect
of
suppressed
spite
the
natural
end
of
every
adder
not
suffered
to
empty
its
but
she
and
her
son
agreed
i
take
it
that
no
one
should
touch
on
the
story
to
wake
it
for
the
wound
in
the
duke
pride
rankled
fiery
so
they
made
no
search
and
small
inquiry
and
when
fresh
gypsies
have
paid
us
a
visit
i
noticed
the
couple
were
never
inquisitive
but
told
them
they
folks
the
duke
do
want
here
and
bade
them
make
haste
and
cross
the
frontier
brief
the
duchess
was
gone
and
the
duke
was
glad
of
it
and
the
old
one
was
in
the
young
one
stead
and
took
in
her
place
the
household
head
and
a
blessed
time
the
household
had
of
it
and
were
i
not
as
a
man
may
say
cautious
how
i
trench
more
than
needs
on
the
nauseous
i
could
favor
you
with
sundry
touches
of
the
with
which
the
duchess
heightened
the
mellowness
of
her
cheek
yellowness
to
get
on
faster
until
at
last
her
cheek
grew
to
be
one
of
mucus
and
fucus
from
mere
use
of
ceruse
in
short
she
grew
from
scalp
to
udder
just
the
object
to
make
you
shudder
xvii
you
my
friend
what
a
thing
friendship
is
world
without
end
how
it
gives
the
heart
and
soul
a
as
if
somebody
broached
you
a
glorious
runlet
and
poured
out
all
lovelily
sparklingly
sunlit
our
green
moldavia
the
streaky
syrup
cotnar
as
old
as
the
time
of
the
druids
friendship
may
match
with
that
monarch
of
fluids
each
supples
a
dry
brain
fills
you
its
gives
your
life
hourglass
a
shake
when
the
thin
sand
doubts
whether
to
run
on
or
stop
short
and
guarantees
age
is
not
all
made
of
stark
sloth
and
arrant
ease
i
have
seen
my
little
lady
once
more
jacynth
the
gypsy
berold
and
the
rest
of
it
for
to
me
spoke
the
duke
as
i
told
you
before
i
always
wanted
to
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
and
now
it
is
made
why
my
heart
blood
that
went
trickle
trickle
but
anon
in
such
muddy
driblets
is
pumped
up
brisk
now
through
the
main
ventricle
and
genially
floats
me
about
the
giblets
i
tell
you
what
i
intend
to
do
i
must
see
this
fellow
his
sad
life
through
he
is
our
duke
after
all
and
i
as
he
says
but
a
serf
and
thrall
my
father
was
born
here
and
i
inherit
his
fame
a
chain
he
bound
his
son
with

i
pay
in
a
lump
i
should
prefer
it
but
there
no
mine
to
blow
up
and
get
done
with
so
i
must
stay
till
the
end
of
the
chapter
for

to

to
be
glad
on

sorry

day
or
other

a
morion

in
a

kick
up
slain
by
an
onslaught
fierce

hiccup
and
then
when
red
doth
the
sword
of
our
duke
rust
and
its
leathern
sheath
lie
with
a
blue
crust
then
i
shall
scrape
together
my
earnings

childe
roland
to
the
dark
tower
came
see
edgar
song
in
my
first
thought
was
he
lied
in
every
word
that
hoary
cripple
with
malicious
eye
askance
to
watch
the
working
of
his
lie
on
mine
and
mouth
scarce
able
to
afford
suppression
of
the
glee
that
pursed
and
scored
its
edge
at
one
more
victim
gained
thereby
what
else
should
he
be
set
for
with
his
staff
what
save
to
waylay
with
his
lies
ensnare
all
travelers
who
might
find
him
posted
there
and
ask
the
road
i
guessed
what
laugh
would
break
what
crutch
write
my
epitaph
for
pastime
in
the
dusty
thoroughfare
if
at
his
counsel
i
should
turn
aside
into
the
ominous
tract
which
all
agree
hides
the
dark
tower
yet
acquiescingly
i
did
turn
as
he
pointed
neither
pride
nor
hope
rekindling
at
the
end
descried
so
much
as
gladness
that
some
end
might
be
for
what
with
my
whole
wandering
what
with
my
search
drawn
out
through
years
my
hope
dwindled
into
a
ghost
not
fit
to
cope
with
that
obstreperous
joy
success
would
bring
i
hardly
tried
now
to
rebuke
the
spring
my
heart
made
finding
failure
in
its
scope
as
when
a
sick
man
very
near
to
death
seems
dead
indeed
and
feels
begin
and
end
the
tears
and
takes
the
farewell
of
each
friend
and
hears
one
bid
the
other
go
draw
breath
freelier
outside
since
all
is
he
saith
and
the
blow
fallen
no
grieving
can
amend
while
some
discuss
if
near
the
other
graves
be
room
enough
for
this
and
when
a
day
suits
best
for
carrying
the
corpse
away
with
care
about
the
banners
scarves
and
staves
and
still
the
man
hears
all
and
only
craves
he
may
not
shame
such
tender
love
and
stay
thus
i
had
so
long
suffered
in
this
quest
heard
failure
prophesied
so
oft
been
writ
so
many
times
among
the
band
to
wit
the
knights
who
to
the
dark
tower
search
addressed
their
steps
that
just
to
fail
as
they
seemed
best
and
all
the
doubt
was
now
should
i
be
fit
so
quiet
as
despair
i
turned
from
him
that
hateful
cripple
out
of
his
highway
into
the
path
he
pointed
all
the
day
had
been
a
dreary
one
at
best
and
dim
was
settling
to
its
close
yet
shot
one
grim
red
leer
to
see
the
plain
catch
its
estray
for
mark
no
sooner
was
i
fairly
found
pledged
to
the
plain
after
a
pace
or
two
than
pausing
to
throw
backward
a
last
view
the
safe
road
was
gone
gray
plain
all
round
nothing
but
plain
to
the
horizon
bound
i
might
go
on
naught
else
remained
to
do
so
on
i
went
i
think
i
never
saw
such
starved
ignoble
nature
nothing
throve
for
flowers
as
well
expect
a
cedar
grove
but
cockle
spurge
according
to
their
law
might
propagate
their
kind
with
none
to
awe
you
think
a
bur
had
been
a
no
penury
inertness
and
grimace
in
some
strange
sort
were
the
land
portion
see
or
shut
your
eyes
said
nature
peevishly
it
nothing
skills
i
can
not
help
my
case
is
the
last
judgment
fire
must
cure
this
place
calcine
its
clods
and
set
my
prisoners
free
if
there
pushed
any
ragged
above
its
mates
the
head
was
chopped
the
bents
were
jealous
else
what
made
those
holes
and
rents
in
the
dock
harsh
swarth
leaves
bruised
as
to
balk
all
hope
of
greenness
is
a
brute
must
walk
pashing
their
life
out
with
a
brute
intents
as
for
the
grass
it
grew
as
scant
as
hair
in
leprosy
thin
dry
blades
pricked
the
mud
which
underneath
looked
kneaded
up
with
blood
one
stiff
blind
horse
his
every
bone
stood
stupefied
however
he
came
there
thrust
out
past
service
from
the
devil
stud
alive
he
might
be
dead
for
aught
i
know
with
that
red
gaunt
and
colloped
neck
and
shut
eyes
underneath
the
rusty
mane
seldom
went
such
grotesqueness
with
such
woe
i
never
saw
a
brute
i
hated
so
he
must
be
wicked
to
deserve
such
pain
i
shut
my
eyes
and
turned
them
on
my
heart
as
a
man
calls
for
wine
before
he
fights
i
asked
one
draft
of
earlier
happier
sights
ere
fitly
i
could
hope
to
play
my
part
think
first
fight
afterwards
the
soldier
art
one
taste
of
the
old
time
sets
all
to
rights
not
it
i
fancied
cuthbert
reddening
face
beneath
its
garniture
of
curly
gold
dear
fellow
till
i
almost
felt
him
fold
an
arm
in
mine
to
fix
me
to
the
place
that
way
he
used
alas
one
night
disgrace
out
went
my
heart
new
fire
and
left
it
cold
giles
then
the
soul
of
honor
there
he
stands
frank
as
ten
years
ago
when
knighted
first
what
honest
man
should
dare
he
said
he
durst
good
but
the
scene
shifts
faugh
what
hangman
hands
pin
to
his
breast
a
parchment
his
own
bands
read
it
poor
traitor
spit
upon
and
cursed
better
this
present
than
a
past
like
that
back
therefore
to
my
darkening
path
again
no
sound
no
sight
as
far
as
eye
could
strain
will
the
night
send
a
howlet
or
a
bat
i
asked
when
something
on
the
dismal
flat
came
to
arrest
my
thoughts
and
change
their
train
a
sudden
little
river
crossed
my
path
as
unexpected
as
a
serpent
comes
no
sluggish
tide
congenial
to
the
glooms
this
as
it
frothed
by
might
have
been
a
bath
for
the
fiend
glowing
hoof
to
see
the
wrath
of
its
black
eddy
bespate
with
flakes
and
spumes
so
petty
yet
so
spiteful
all
along
low
scrubby
alders
kneeled
down
over
it
drenched
willows
flung
them
headlong
in
a
fit
of
mute
despair
a
suicidal
throng
the
river
which
had
done
them
all
the
wrong
that
was
rolled
by
deterred
no
whit
which
while
i
forded
good
saints
how
i
feared
to
set
my
foot
upon
a
dead
man
cheek
each
step
or
feel
the
spear
i
thrust
to
seek
for
hollows
tangled
in
his
hair
or
beard
it
may
have
been
a
i
speared
but
ugh
it
sounded
like
a
baby
shriek
glad
was
i
when
i
reached
the
other
bank
now
for
a
better
country
vain
presage
who
were
the
strugglers
what
war
did
they
wage
whose
savage
trample
thus
could
pad
the
dank
soil
to
a
plash
toads
in
a
poisoned
tank
or
wild
cats
in
a
iron
cage
the
fight
must
so
have
seemed
in
that
fell
cirque
what
penned
them
there
with
all
the
plain
to
choose
no
footprint
leading
to
that
horrid
mews
none
out
of
it
mad
brewage
set
to
work
their
brains
no
doubt
like
the
turk
pits
for
his
pastime
christians
against
jews
and
more
than
that
a
furlong
on
why
there
what
bad
use
was
that
engine
for
that
wheel
or
brake
not
wheel
that
harrow
fit
to
reel
men
bodies
out
like
silk
with
all
the
air
of
tophet
tool
on
earth
left
unaware
or
brought
to
sharpen
its
rusty
teeth
of
steel
then
came
a
bit
of
stubbed
ground
once
a
wood
next
a
marsh
it
would
seem
and
now
mere
earth
desperate
and
done
with
so
a
fool
finds
mirth
makes
a
thing
and
then
mars
it
till
his
mood
changes
and
off
he
goes
within
a
rood
bog
clay
and
rubble
sand
and
stark
black
dearth
now
blotches
rankling
colored
gay
and
grim
now
patches
where
some
leanness
of
the
broke
into
moss
or
substances
like
boils
then
came
some
palsied
oak
a
cleft
in
him
like
a
distorted
mouth
that
splits
its
rim
gaping
at
death
and
dies
while
it
recoils
and
just
as
far
as
ever
from
the
end
naught
in
the
distance
but
the
evening
naught
to
point
my
footstep
further
at
the
thought
a
great
black
bird
apollyon
sailed
past
nor
beat
his
wide
wing
that
brushed
my
cap
perchance
the
guide
i
sought
for
looking
up
aware
i
somehow
grew
of
the
dusk
the
plain
had
given
place
all
round
to
mountains
with
such
name
to
grace
mere
ugly
heights
and
heaps
now
stolen
in
view
how
thus
they
had
surprised
me
solve
it
you
how
to
get
from
them
was
no
clearer
case
yet
half
i
seemed
to
recognize
some
trick
of
mischief
happened
to
me
god
knows
when
in
a
bad
dream
perhaps
here
ended
then
progress
this
way
when
in
the
very
nick
of
giving
up
one
time
more
came
a
click
as
when
a
trap
shuts
you
inside
the
den
burningly
it
came
on
me
all
at
once
this
was
the
place
those
two
hills
on
the
right
crouched
like
two
bulls
locked
horn
in
horn
in
fight
while
to
the
left
a
tall
scalped
mountain
dunce
dotard
at
the
very
nonce
after
a
life
spent
training
for
the
sight
what
in
the
midst
lay
but
the
tower
itself
the
round
squat
turret
blind
as
the
fool
heart
built
of
brown
stone
without
a
counterpart
in
the
whole
world
the
tempest
mocking
elf
points
to
the
shipman
thus
the
unseen
shelf
he
strikes
on
only
when
the
timbers
start
not
see
because
of
night
perhaps
why
day
came
back
again
for
that
before
it
left
the
dying
sunset
kindled
through
a
cleft
the
hills
like
giants
at
a
hunting
lay
chin
upon
hand
to
see
the
game
at
bay
now
stab
and
end
the
creature
to
the
heft
not
hear
when
noise
was
everywhere
it
tolled
increasing
like
a
bell
names
in
my
ears
of
all
the
lost
adventurers
my
peers
how
such
a
one
was
strong
and
such
was
bold
and
such
was
fortunate
yet
each
of
old
lost
lost
one
moment
knelled
the
woe
of
years
there
they
stood
ranged
along
the
hillsides
met
to
view
the
last
of
me
a
living
frame
for
one
more
picture
in
a
sheet
of
flame
i
saw
them
and
i
knew
them
all
and
yet
dauntless
the
to
my
lips
i
set
and
blew
roland
to
the
dark
tower
how
it
strikes
a
contemporary
i
only
knew
one
poet
in
my
life
and
this
or
something
like
it
was
his
way
you
saw
go
up
and
down
valladolid
a
man
of
mark
to
know
next
time
you
saw
his
very
serviceable
suit
of
black
was
courtly
once
and
conscientious
still
and
many
might
have
worn
it
though
none
did
the
cloak
that
somewhat
shone
and
showed
the
threads
had
purpose
and
the
ruff
significance
he
walked
and
tapped
the
pavement
with
his
cane
scenting
the
world
looking
it
full
in
face
an
old
dog
bald
and
blindish
at
his
heels
they
turned
up
now
the
alley
by
the
church
that
leads
nowhither
now
they
breathed
themselves
on
the
main
promenade
just
at
the
wrong
time
you
come
upon
his
scrutinizing
hat
making
a
peaked
shade
blacker
than
itself
against
the
single
window
spared
some
house
intact
yet
with
its
moldered
moorish
work
or
else
surprise
the
ferrel
of
his
stick
trying
the
mortar
temper
the
chinks
of
some
new
shop
french
and
fine
he
stood
and
watched
the
cobbler
at
his
trade
the
man
who
slices
lemons
into
drink
the
brazier
and
the
boys
that
volunteer
to
help
him
turn
its
winch
he
glanced
books
on
stalls
with
half
an
eye
and
ballads
on
the
vender
string
and
posters
by
the
wall
he
took
such
cognizance
of
men
and
things
if
any
beat
a
horse
you
felt
he
saw
if
any
cursed
a
woman
he
took
note
yet
stared
at
nobody
you
stared
at
him
and
found
less
to
your
pleasure
than
surprise
he
seemed
to
know
you
and
expect
as
much
so
next
time
that
a
neighbor
tongue
was
loosed
it
marked
the
shameful
and
notorious
fact
we
had
among
us
not
so
much
a
spy
as
a
recording
the
town
true
master
if
the
town
but
knew
we
merely
kept
a
governor
for
form
while
this
man
walked
about
and
took
account
of
all
thought
said
and
acted
then
went
home
and
wrote
it
fully
to
our
lord
the
king
who
has
an
itch
to
know
things
he
knows
why
and
reads
them
in
his
bedroom
of
a
night
oh
you
might
smile
there
wanted
not
a
touch
a
tang
of
well
it
was
not
wholly
ease
as
back
into
your
mind
the
man
look
came
stricken
in
years
a
little
such
a
brow
his
eyes
had
to
live
under
clear
as
flint
on
either
side
the
formidable
nose
curved
cut
and
colored
like
an
eagle
claw
had
he
to
do
with
a
surprising
fate
when
altogether
old
b
disappeared
and
young
c
got
his
mistress
our
friend
his
letter
to
the
king
that
did
it
all
what
paid
the
bloodless
man
for
so
much
pains
our
lord
the
king
has
favorites
manifold
and
shifts
his
ministry
some
once
a
month
our
city
gets
new
governors
at
whiles
but
never
word
or
sign
that
i
could
hear
notified
to
this
man
about
the
streets
the
king
approval
of
those
letters
conned
the
last
thing
duly
at
the
dead
of
night
did
the
man
love
his
office
frowned
our
lord
exhorting
when
none
heard
beseech
me
not
too
far
above
my
people
beneath
me
i
set
the
watch
how
should
the
people
know
forget
them
keep
me
all
the
more
in
mind
was
some
such
understanding
the
two
i
found
no
truth
in
one
report
at
least
that
if
you
tracked
him
to
his
home
down
lanes
beyond
the
jewry
and
as
clean
to
pace
you
found
he
ate
his
supper
in
a
room
blazing
with
lights
four
titians
on
the
walls
and
twenty
naked
girls
to
change
his
plate
poor
man
he
lived
another
kind
of
life
in
that
new
stuccoed
third
house
by
the
bridge
rather
smart
than
otherwise
the
whole
street
might
him
as
he
sat
leg
crossing
leg
one
foot
on
the
dog
back
playing
a
decent
cribbage
with
his
maid
jacynth
you
sure
her
name
was
the
cheese
and
fruit
three
red
halves
of
starved
or
treat
of
radishes
in
april
nine
ten
struck
the
church
clock
straight
to
bed
went
he
my
father
like
the
man
of
sense
he
was
would
point
him
out
to
me
a
dozen
times
he
whisper
the
corregidor
i
had
been
used
to
think
that
personage
was
one
with
lacquered
breeches
lustrous
belt
and
feathers
like
a
forest
in
his
hat
who
blew
a
trumpet
and
proclaimed
the
news
announced
the
gave
each
church
its
turn
and
memorized
the
miracle
in
vogue
he
had
a
great
observance
from
us
boys
we
were
in
error
that
was
not
the
man
i
like
now
yet
had
haply
been
afraid
to
have
just
looked
when
this
man
came
to
die
and
seen
who
lined
the
clean
gay
and
stood
about
the
neat
low
with
the
heavenly
manner
of
relieving
guard
here
had
been
mark
the
through
a
whole
campaign
of
the
world
life
and
death
doing
the
king
work
all
the
dim
day
long
in
his
old
coat
and
up
to
knees
in
mud
smoked
like
a
herring
dining
on
a
crust
and
now
the
day
was
won
relieved
at
once
no
further
show
or
need
for
that
old
coat
you
are
sure
for
one
thing
bless
us
all
the
while
how
sprucely
we
are
dressed
out
you
and
i
a
second
and
the
angels
alter
that
well
i
could
never
write
a
verse
could
you
let
to
the
prado
and
make
the
most
of
time
fra

a
monk

is
past
midnight
and
you
go
the
rounds

catch
me
at
an
alley
end
where
sportive
ladies
leave
their
doors
ajar
the
carmine
my
cloister
hunt
it
up
do
harry
out
if
you
must
show
your
zeal
whatever
rat
there
haps
on
his
wrong
hole
and
nip
each
softling
of
a
wee
white
mouse
that
crept
to
keep
him
company

square
again
i
like
his
face
his
elbowing
on
his
comrade
in
the
door
with
the
pike
and
lantern
for
the
slave
that
holds
john
baptist
head
by
the
hair

hand

proper
twinkle

eye

looks

first

and
set
things
straight
now
hip
to
haunch
here

and
the
nights
one
makes
up
bands
to
roam
the
town
and
sing
out
carnival
and
i
been
three
weeks
shut
within
my
mew
for
the
great
man
saints
and
saints
and
saints
again
i
could
not
paint
all
night
ouf
i
leaned
out
of
window
for
fresh
air
there
came
a
hurry
of
feet
and
little
feet
a
sweep
of
laughs
and
whifts
of
song
o
the
broom
away
love
and
our
earth
is
a
tomb
o
the
quince
let
lisa
go
and
what
good
in
life
since
o
the
and
so
on
round
they
went
scarce
had
they
turned
the
corner
when
a
titter
like
the
skipping
of
rabbits
by
moonlight
three
slim
shapes
and
a
face
that
looked
up
zooks
sir
flesh
and
blood
that
all
i
made
of
into
shreds
it
went
curtain
and
counterpane
and
coverlet
all
the
a
dozen
knots
there
was
a
ladder
down
i
let
myself
hands
and
feet
scrambling
somehow
and
so
dropped
and
after
them
i
came
up
with
the
fun
hard
by
saint
laurence
hail
fellow
well
met
o
the
rose
i
been
merry
what
matter
who
knows
and
so
i
was
stealing
back
again
to
get
to
bed
and
have
a
bit
of
sleep
ere
i
rise
up
tomorrow
and
go
work
on
jerome
knocking
at
his
poor
old
breast
with
his
great
round
stone
to
subdue
the
flesh
you
snap
me
of
the
sudden
ah
i
see
though
your
eye
twinkles
still
you
shake
your
head
mine
shaved
a
monk
you
say
the
sting
in
that
if
master
cosimo
announced
himself
mum
the
word
naturally
but
a
monk
come
what
am
i
a
beast
for
tell
us
now
i
was
a
baby
when
my
mother
died
and
father
died
and
left
me
in
the
street
i
starved
there
god
knows
how
a
year
or
two
on
rinds
and
shucks
refuse
and
rubbish
one
fine
frosty
day
my
stomach
being
empty
as
your
hat
the
wind
doubled
me
up
and
down
i
went
old
aunt
lapaccia
trussed
me
with
one
hand
its
fellow
was
a
stinger
as
i
knew
and
so
along
the
wall
over
the
bridge
by
the
straight
cut
to
the
convent
six
words
there
while
i
stood
munching
my
first
bread
that
month
so
boy
you
minded
quoth
the
good
fat
father
wiping
his
own
mouth
was
to
quit
this
very
miserable
world
will
you
renounce
the
mouthful
of
bread
thought
i
by
no
means
brief
they
made
a
monk
of
me
i
did
renounce
the
world
its
pride
and
greed
palace
farm
villa
shop
and
trash
such
as
these
poor
devils
of
medici
have
given
their
hearts
to
all
at
eight
years
old
well
sir
i
found
in
time
you
may
be
sure
was
not
for
nothing
the
good
bellyful
the
warm
serge
and
the
rope
that
goes
all
round
and
blessed
idleness
beside
let
see
what
the
urchin
fit
for
that
came
next
not
overmuch
their
way
i
must
confess
such
a
they
tried
me
with
their
books
lord
they
have
taught
me
latin
in
pure
waste
o
the
clove
the
latin
i
construe
is
amo
i
love
but
mind
you
when
a
boy
starves
in
the
streets
eight
years
together
as
my
fortune
was
watching
folk
faces
to
know
who
will
fling
the
bit
of
he
desires
and
who
will
curse
or
kick
him
for
his
pains
which
gentleman
processional
and
fine
holding
a
candle
to
the
sacrament
will
wink
and
let
him
lift
a
plate
and
catch
the
droppings
of
the
wax
to
sell
again
or
holla
for
the
eight
and
have
him
whipped
how
say
i
nay
which
dog
bites
which
lets
drop
his
bone
from
the
heap
of
offal
in
the
street
why
soul
and
sense
of
him
grow
sharp
alike
he
learns
the
look
of
things
and
none
the
less
for
admonition
from
the
i
had
a
store
of
such
remarks
be
sure
which
after
i
found
leisure
turned
to
use
i
drew
men
faces
on
my
copy
books
scrawled
them
within
the
antiphonary
marge
joined
legs
and
arms
to
the
long
found
eyes
and
nose
and
chin
for
a
and
b
and
made
a
string
of
pictures
of
the
world
betwixt
the
ins
and
outs
of
verb
and
noun
on
the
wall
the
bench
the
door
the
monks
looked
black
nay
quoth
the
prior
turn
him
out
d
say
in
no
wise
lose
a
crow
and
catch
a
lark
what
if
at
last
we
get
our
man
of
parts
we
carmelites
like
those
camaldolese
and
preaching
friars
to
do
our
church
up
fine
and
put
the
front
on
it
that
ought
to
be
and
hereupon
he
bade
me
daub
away
thank
you
my
head
being
crammed
the
walls
a
blank
never
was
such
prompt
disemburdening
first
every
sort
of
monk
the
black
and
white
i
drew
them
fat
and
lean
then
folk
at
church
from
good
old
gossips
waiting
to
confess
their
cribs
of
to
the
breathless
fellow
at
the
fresh
from
his
murder
safe
and
sitting
there
with
the
little
children
round
him
in
a
row
of
admiration
half
for
his
beard
and
half
for
that
white
anger
of
his
victim
son
shaking
a
fist
at
him
with
one
fierce
arm
signing
himself
with
the
other
because
of
christ
whose
sad
face
on
the
cross
sees
only
this
after
the
passion
of
a
thousand
years
till
some
poor
girl
her
apron
her
head
which
the
intense
eyes
looked
through
came
at
eve
on
tiptoe
said
a
word
dropped
in
a
loaf
her
pair
of
earrings
and
a
bunch
of
flowers
the
brute
took
growling
prayed
and
so
was
gone
i
painted
all
then
cried
is
ask
and
have
choose
for
more
ready
laid
the
ladder
flat
and
showed
my
covered
bit
of
the
monks
closed
in
a
circle
and
praised
loud
till
checked
taught
what
to
see
and
not
to
see
being
simple
bodies
that
the
very
man
look
at
the
boy
who
stoops
to
pat
the
dog
that
woman
like
the
prior
niece
who
comes
to
care
about
his
asthma
it
the
life
but
there
my
triumph
flared
and
funked
their
betters
took
their
turn
to
see
and
say
the
prior
and
the
learned
pulled
a
face
and
stopped
all
that
in
no
time
how
what
here
quite
from
the
mark
of
painting
bless
us
all
faces
arms
legs
and
bodies
like
the
true
as
much
as
pea
and
pea
it
your
business
is
not
to
catch
men
with
show
with
homage
to
the
perishable
clay
but
lift
them
over
it
ignore
it
all
make
them
forget
there
such
a
thing
as
flesh
your
business
is
to
paint
the
souls
of
men
man
soul
and
it
a
fire
smoke
no
it
not
it
vapor
done
up
like
a
babe
in
that
shape
when
you
die
it
leaves
your
mouth
it
well
what
matters
talking
it
the
soul
give
us
no
more
of
body
than
shows
soul
here
giotto
with
his
saint
god
that
sets
us
praising
why
not
stop
with
him
why
put
all
thoughts
of
praise
out
of
our
head
with
wonder
at
lines
colors
and
what
not
paint
the
soul
never
mind
the
legs
and
arms
rub
all
out
try
at
it
a
second
time
oh
that
white
smallish
female
with
the
breasts
she
just
my
niece
herodias
i
would
say
who
went
and
danced
and
got
men
heads
cut
off
have
it
all
out
now
is
this
sense
i
ask
a
fine
way
to
paint
soul
by
painting
body
so
ill
the
eye
ca
stop
there
must
go
further
and
ca
fare
worse
thus
yellow
does
for
white
when
what
you
put
for
yellow
simply
black
and
any
sort
of
meaning
looks
intense
when
all
beside
itself
means
and
looks
naught
why
ca
a
painter
lift
each
foot
in
turn
left
foot
and
right
foot
go
a
double
step
make
his
flesh
liker
and
his
soul
more
like
both
in
their
order
take
the
prettiest
face
the
prior
niece
is
it
so
pretty
you
ca
discover
if
it
means
hope
fear
sorrow
or
joy
wo
beauty
go
with
these
suppose
i
made
her
eyes
all
right
and
blue
ca
i
take
breath
and
try
to
add
life
flash
and
then
add
soul
and
heighten
them
or
say
there
beauty
with
no
soul
at
all
i
never
saw
it
put
the
case
the
same
if
you
get
simple
beauty
and
naught
else
you
get
about
the
best
thing
god
invents
that
somewhat
and
you
find
the
soul
you
have
missed
within
yourself
when
you
return
him
thanks
rub
all
out
well
well
there
my
life
in
short
and
so
the
thing
has
gone
on
ever
since
i
grown
a
man
no
doubt
i
broken
bounds
you
should
not
take
a
fellow
eight
years
old
and
make
him
swear
to
never
kiss
the
girls
i
my
own
master
paint
now
as
i
please
having
a
friend
you
see
in
the
lord
it
fast
holding
by
the
rings
in
front
those
great
rings
serve
more
purposes
than
just
to
plant
a
flag
in
or
tie
up
a
horse
and
yet
the
old
schooling
sticks
the
old
grave
eyes
are
peeping
my
shoulder
as
i
work
the
heads
shake
still
it
art
decline
my
son
you
not
of
the
true
painters
great
and
old
brother
angelico
the
man
you
find
brother
lorenzo
stands
his
single
peer
fag
on
at
flesh
you
never
make
the
third
o
the
pine
keep
your
mist
manners
and
i
stick
to
mine
i
not
the
third
then
bless
us
they
must
know
do
you
think
they
the
likeliest
to
know
they
with
their
latin
so
i
swallow
my
rage
clench
my
teeth
suck
my
lips
in
tight
and
paint
to
please
them
sometimes
do
and
sometimes
do
for
doing
most
there
pretty
sure
to
come
a
turn
some
warm
eve
finds
me
at
my
saints
a
laugh
a
cry
the
business
of
the
world
flower
o
the
peach
for
us
all
and
his
own
life
for
each
and
my
whole
soul
revolves
the
cup
runs
over
the
world
and
life
too
big
to
pass
for
a
dream
and
i
do
these
wild
things
in
sheer
despite
and
play
the
fooleries
you
catch
me
at
in
pure
rage
the
old
out
at
grass
after
hard
years
throws
up
his
stiff
heels
so
although
the
miller
does
not
preach
to
him
the
only
good
of
grass
is
to
make
chaff
what
would
men
have
do
they
like
grass
or
no
may
they
or
may
they
all
i
want
the
thing
settled
forever
one
way
as
it
is
you
tell
too
many
lies
and
hurt
yourself
you
do
like
what
you
only
like
too
much
you
do
like
what
if
given
you
at
your
word
you
find
abundantly
detestable
for
me
i
think
i
speak
as
i
was
taught
i
always
see
the
garden
and
god
there
man
wife
and
my
lesson
learned
the
value
and
significance
of
flesh
i
ca
unlearn
ten
minutes
afterwards
you
understand
me
i
a
beast
i
know
but
see
now
why
i
see
as
certainly
as
that
the
about
to
shine
what
will
hap
some
day
we
a
youngster
here
comes
to
our
convent
studies
what
i
do
slouches
and
stares
and
lets
no
atom
drop
his
name
is
guidi
he
not
mind
the
monks
they
call
him
hulking
tom
he
lets
them
talk
he
picks
my
practice
up
he
paint
apace
i
hope
so
though
i
never
live
so
long
i
know
what
sure
to
follow
you
be
judge
you
speak
no
latin
more
than
i
belike
however
you
my
man
you
seen
the
world
the
beauty
and
the
wonder
and
the
power
the
shapes
of
things
their
colors
lights
and
shades
changes
surprises
and
god
made
it
all
for
what
do
you
feel
thankful
aye
or
no
for
this
fair
town
face
yonder
river
line
the
mountain
round
it
and
the
sky
above
much
more
the
figures
of
man
woman
child
these
are
the
frame
to
what
it
all
about
to
be
passed
over
despised
or
dwelt
upon
wondered
at
oh
this
last
of
course
you
say
but
why
not
do
as
well
as
say
paint
these
just
as
they
are
careless
what
comes
of
it
god
works
paint
any
one
and
count
it
crime
to
let
a
truth
slip
do
object
his
works
are
here
already
nature
is
complete
suppose
you
reproduce
her
which
you
ca
there
no
advantage
you
must
beat
her
then
for
do
you
mark
we
made
so
that
we
love
first
when
we
see
them
painted
things
we
have
passed
perhaps
a
hundred
times
nor
cared
to
see
and
so
they
are
better
painted
better
to
us
which
is
the
same
thing
art
was
given
for
that
god
uses
us
to
help
each
other
so
lending
our
minds
out
have
you
noticed
now
your
cullion
hanging
face
a
bit
of
chalk
and
trust
me
but
you
should
though
how
much
more
if
i
drew
higher
things
with
the
same
truth
that
were
to
take
the
prior
interpret
god
to
all
of
you
oh
oh
it
makes
me
mad
to
see
what
men
shall
do
and
we
in
our
graves
this
world
no
blot
for
us
nor
blank
it
means
intensely
and
means
good
to
find
its
meaning
is
my
meat
and
drink
aye
but
you
do
so
instigate
to
prayer
strikes
in
the
prior
when
your
meaning
plain
it
does
not
say
to
folk
remember
matins
or
mind
you
fast
next
friday
why
for
this
what
need
of
art
at
all
a
skull
and
bones
two
bits
of
stick
nailed
crosswise
or
what
best
a
bell
to
chime
the
hour
with
does
as
well
i
painted
a
saint
laurence
six
months
since
at
prato
splashed
the
fresco
in
fine
style
how
looks
my
painting
now
the
scaffold
down
i
ask
a
brother
hugely
he
returns
already
not
one
phiz
of
your
three
slaves
who
turn
the
deacon
off
his
toasted
side
but
scratched
and
prodded
to
our
heart
content
the
pious
people
have
so
eased
their
own
with
coming
to
say
prayers
there
in
a
rage
we
get
on
fast
to
see
the
bricks
beneath
expect
another
job
this
time
next
year
for
pity
and
religion
grow
i
the
crowd
your
painting
serves
its
purpose
hang
the
fools
that
is
you
not
mistake
an
idle
word
spoke
in
a
huff
by
a
poor
monk
god
wot
tasting
the
air
this
spicy
night
which
turns
the
unaccustomed
head
like
chianti
wine
oh
the
church
knows
do
misreport
me
now
it
natural
a
poor
monk
out
of
bounds
should
have
his
apt
word
to
excuse
himself
and
hearken
how
i
plot
to
make
amends
i
have
bethought
me
i
shall
paint
a
piece
there
for
you
give
me
six
months
then
go
see
something
in
sant
ambrogio
bless
the
nuns
they
want
a
cast
o
my
office
i
shall
paint
god
in
the
midst
madonna
and
her
babe
ringed
by
a
bowery
flowery
lilies
and
vestments
and
white
faces
sweet
as
puff
on
puff
of
grated
when
ladies
crowd
to
church
at
midsummer
and
then
i
the
front
of
course
a
saint
or
two
saint
john
because
he
saves
the
florentines
saint
ambrose
who
puts
down
in
black
and
white
the
convent
friends
and
gives
them
a
long
day
and
job
i
must
have
him
there
past
mistake
the
man
of
uz
and
us
without
the
z
painters
who
need
his
patience
well
all
these
secured
at
their
devotion
up
shall
come
out
of
a
corner
when
you
least
expect
as
one
by
a
dark
stair
into
a
great
light
music
and
talking
who
but
lippo
i
mazed
motionless
and
moonstruck
i
the
man
back
i
shrink
what
is
this
i
see
and
hear
i
caught
up
with
my
by
mistake
my
old
serge
gown
and
rope
that
goes
all
round
i
in
this
presence
this
pure
company
where
a
hole
where
a
corner
for
escape
then
steps
a
sweet
angelic
slip
of
a
thing
forward
puts
out
a
soft
palm
not
so
fast
addresses
the
celestial
presence
nay
he
made
you
and
devised
you
after
all
though
he
none
of
you
could
saint
john
there
draw
his
make
up
a
we
come
to
brother
lippo
for
all
that
perfecit
opus
so
all
smile
i
shuffle
sideways
with
my
blushing
face
under
the
cover
of
a
hundred
wings
thrown
like
a
spread
of
kirtles
when
you
gay
and
play
hot
cockles
all
the
doors
being
shut
till
wholly
unexpected
in
there
pops
the
hothead
husband
thus
i
scuttle
off
to
some
safe
bench
behind
not
letting
go
the
palm
of
her
the
little
lily
thing
that
spoke
the
good
word
for
me
in
the
nick
like
the
prior
niece
saint
lucy
i
would
say
and
so
all
saved
for
me
and
for
the
church
a
pretty
picture
gained
go
six
months
hence
your
hand
sir
and
no
lights
no
lights
the
street
hushed
and
i
know
my
own
way
back
do
fear
me
there
the
gray
beginning
zooks
andrea
del
sarto

the
faultless
painter
but
do
not
let
us
quarrel
any
more

my
lucrezia
bear
with
me
for
once
sit
down
and
all
shall
happen
as
you
wish
you
turn
your
face
but
does
it
bring
your
heart
i
work
then
for
your
friend

his
own
subject
after
his
own
way

his
own
time

too
his
own
price
and
shut
the
money
into
this
small
hand
when
next
it
takes
mine
will
it
tenderly
oh
i
content
him
but
tomorrow
love
i
often
am
much
wearier
than
you
think
this
evening
more
than
usual
and
it
seems
as
if
forgive
now

you
let
me
sit
here
by
the
window
with
your
hand
in
mine
and
look
a
forth
on
fiesole

of
one
mind
as
married
people

evening

get
up

my
work

and
fresh
as

us
try
tomorrow

you
shall
be
glad
for
this

soft
hand

woman

itself

man

the
time

serve
for
each
of
the
five
pictures

require

saves
a
model
so
keep
looking
so
my
serpentining
beauty
rounds
on
rounds
how
could
you
ever
prick
those
perfect
ears
even
to
put
the
pearl
there
oh
so
sweet
my
face
my
moon
my
everybody
moon
which
everybody
looks
on
and
calls
his
and
i
suppose
is
looked
on
by
in
turn
while
she
looks
no
one
very
dear
no
less
you
smile
why
there
my
picture
ready
made
there
what
we
painters
call
our
harmony
a
common
grayness
silvers
everything
all
in
a
twilight
you
and
i
alike
you
at
the
point
of
your
first
pride
in
me
that
gone
you
know
but
i
at
every
point
my
youth
my
hope
my
art
being
all
toned
down
to
yonder
sober
pleasant
fiesole
there
the
bell
clinking
from
the
that
length
of
across
the
way
holds
the
trees
safer
huddled
more
inside
the
last
monk
leaves
the
garden
days
decrease
and
autumn
grows
autumn
in
everything
eh
the
whole
seems
to
fall
into
a
shape
as
if
i
saw
alike
my
work
and
self
and
all
that
i
was
born
to
be
and
do
a
love
we
are
in
god
hand
how
strange
now
looks
the
life
he
makes
us
lead
so
free
we
seem
so
fettered
fast
we
are
i
feel
he
laid
the
fetter
let
it
lie
this
chamber
for
example
turn
your
head
all
that
behind
us
you
do
understand
nor
care
to
understand
about
my
art
but
you
can
hear
at
least
when
people
speak
and
that
cartoon
the
second
from
the
door
it
is
the
thing
love
so
such
thing
should
be
behold
madonna
i
am
bold
to
say
i
can
do
with
my
pencil
what
i
know
what
i
see
what
at
bottom
of
my
heart
i
wish
for
if
i
ever
wish
so
deep
do
easily
too
when
i
say
perfectly
i
do
not
boast
perhaps
yourself
are
judge
who
listened
to
the
legate
talk
last
week
and
just
as
much
they
used
to
say
in
france
at
any
rate
is
easy
all
of
it
no
sketches
first
no
studies
that
long
past
i
do
what
many
dream
of
all
their
lives
dream
strive
to
do
and
agonize
to
do
and
fail
in
doing
i
could
count
twenty
such
on
twice
your
fingers
and
not
leave
this
town
who
strive
you
do
know
how
the
others
strive
to
paint
a
little
thing
like
that
you
smeared
carelessly
passing
with
your
robes
afloat
yet
do
much
less
so
much
less
someone
says
i
know
his
name
no
matter
so
much
less
well
less
is
more
lucrezia
i
am
judged
there
burns
a
truer
light
of
god
in
them
in
their
vexed
beating
stuffed
and
brain
heart
or
else
than
goes
on
to
prompt
this
forthright
craftsman
hand
of
mine
their
works
drop
groundward
but
themselves
i
know
reach
many
a
time
a
heaven
that
shut
to
me
enter
and
take
their
place
there
sure
enough
though
they
come
back
and
can
not
tell
the
world
my
works
are
nearer
heaven
but
i
sit
here
the
sudden
blood
of
these
men
at
a
word
praise
them
it
boils
or
blame
them
it
boils
too
i
painting
from
myself
and
to
myself
know
what
i
do
am
unmoved
by
men
blame
or
their
praise
either
somebody
remarks
morello
outline
there
is
wrongly
traced
his
hue
mistaken
what
of
that
or
else
rightly
traced
and
well
ordered
what
of
that
speak
as
they
please
what
does
the
mountain
care
ah
but
a
man
reach
should
exceed
his
grasp
or
what
a
heaven
for
all
is
placid
and
perfect
with
my
art
the
worse
i
know
both
what
i
want
and
what
might
gain
and
yet
how
profitless
to
know
to
sigh
had
i
been
two
another
and
myself
our
head
would
have
the
world
no
doubt
yonder
a
work
now
of
that
famous
youth
the
urbinate
who
died
five
years
ago
is
copied
george
vasari
sent
it
me
well
i
can
fancy
how
he
did
it
all
pouring
his
soul
with
kings
and
popes
to
see
reaching
that
heaven
might
so
replenish
him
above
and
through
his
art
for
it
gives
way
that
arm
is
wrongly
put
and
there
again
a
fault
to
pardon
in
the
drawing
lines
its
body
so
to
speak
its
soul
is
right
he
means
right
that
a
child
may
understand
still
what
an
arm
and
i
could
alter
it
but
all
the
play
the
insight
and
the
stretch
out
of
me
out
of
me
and
wherefore
out
had
you
enjoined
them
on
me
given
me
soul
we
might
have
risen
to
rafael
i
and
you
nay
love
you
did
give
all
i
asked
i
think
more
than
i
merit
yes
by
many
times
but
had
you
oh
with
the
same
perfect
brow
and
perfect
eyes
and
more
than
perfect
mouth
and
the
low
voice
my
soul
hears
as
a
bird
the
fowler
pipe
and
follows
to
the
snare
had
you
with
these
the
same
but
brought
a
mind
some
women
do
so
had
the
mouth
there
urged
god
and
the
glory
never
care
for
gain
the
present
by
the
future
what
is
that
live
for
fame
side
by
side
with
agnolo
rafael
is
waiting
up
to
god
all
three
i
might
have
done
it
for
you
so
it
seems
perhaps
not
all
is
as
god
overrules
beside
incentives
come
from
the
soul
self
the
rest
avail
not
why
do
i
need
you
what
wife
had
rafael
or
has
agnolo
in
this
world
who
can
do
a
thing
will
not
and
who
would
do
it
can
not
i
perceive
yet
the
will
somewhat
somewhat
too
the
power
and
thus
we
struggle
at
the
end
god
i
conclude
compensates
punishes
is
safer
for
me
if
the
award
be
strict
that
i
am
something
underrated
here
poor
this
long
while
despised
to
speak
the
truth
i
dared
not
do
you
know
leave
home
all
day
for
fear
of
chancing
on
the
paris
lords
the
best
is
when
they
pass
and
look
aside
but
they
speak
sometimes
i
must
bear
it
all
well
may
they
speak
that
francis
that
first
time
and
that
long
festal
year
at
fontainebleau
i
surely
then
could
sometimes
leave
the
ground
put
on
the
glory
rafael
daily
wear
in
that
humane
great
monarch
golden
look
one
finger
in
his
beard
or
twisted
curl
over
his
mouth
good
mark
that
made
the
smile
one
arm
about
my
shoulder
round
my
neck
the
jingle
of
his
gold
chain
in
my
ear
i
painting
proudly
with
his
breath
on
me
all
his
court
round
him
seeing
with
his
eyes
such
frank
french
eyes
and
such
a
fire
of
souls
profuse
my
hand
kept
plying
by
those
hearts
and
best
of
all
this
this
this
face
beyond
this
in
the
background
waiting
on
my
work
to
crown
the
issue
with
a
last
reward
a
good
time
was
it
not
my
kingly
days
and
load
you
not
grown
restless
but
i
know
is
done
and
past
was
right
my
instinct
said
too
live
the
life
grew
golden
and
not
gray
and
i
the
bat
no
sun
should
tempt
out
of
the
grange
whose
four
walls
make
his
world
how
could
it
end
in
any
other
way
you
called
me
and
i
came
home
to
your
heart
the
triumph
was
to
reach
and
stay
there
since
i
reached
it
ere
the
triumph
what
is
lost
let
my
hands
frame
your
face
in
your
hair
gold
you
beautiful
lucrezia
that
are
mine
rafael
did
this
andrea
painted
that
the
roman
is
the
better
when
you
pray
but
still
the
other
virgin
was
his
wife
men
will
excuse
me
i
am
glad
to
judge
both
pictures
in
your
presence
clearer
grows
my
better
fortune
i
resolve
to
think
for
do
you
know
lucrezia
as
god
lives
said
one
day
agnolo
his
very
self
to
rafael
i
have
known
it
all
these
years
when
the
young
man
was
flaming
out
his
thoughts
upon
a
for
rome
to
see
too
lifted
up
in
heart
because
of
it
friend
there
a
certain
sorry
little
scrub
goes
up
and
down
our
florence
none
cares
how
who
were
he
set
to
plan
and
execute
as
you
are
pricked
on
by
your
popes
and
kings
would
bring
the
sweat
into
that
brow
of
yours
to
rafael
and
indeed
the
arm
is
wrong
i
hardly
dare
yet
only
you
to
see
give
the
chalk
here
quick
thus
the
line
should
go
aye
but
the
soul
he
rafael
rub
it
out
still
all
i
care
for
if
he
spoke
the
truth
what
he
why
who
but
michel
agnolo
do
you
forget
already
words
like
those
if
really
there
was
such
a
chance
so
lost
is
whether
you
not
grateful
but
more
pleased
well
let
me
think
so
and
you
smile
indeed
this
hour
has
been
an
hour
another
smile
if
you
would
sit
thus
by
me
every
night
i
should
work
better
do
you
comprehend
i
mean
that
i
should
earn
more
give
you
more
see
it
is
settled
dusk
now
there
a
star
morello
gone
the
show
the
wall
the
speak
the
name
we
call
them
by
come
from
the
window
love
come
in
at
last
inside
the
melancholy
little
house
we
built
to
be
so
gay
with
god
is
just
king
francis
may
forgive
me
oft
at
nights
when
i
look
up
from
painting
eyes
tired
out
the
walls
become
illumined
brick
from
brick
distinct
instead
of
mortar
fierce
bright
gold
that
gold
of
his
i
did
cement
them
with
let
us
but
love
each
other
must
you
go
that
cousin
here
again
he
waits
outside
must
see
you
you
and
not
with
me
those
loans
more
gaming
debts
to
pay
you
smiled
for
that
well
let
smiles
buy
me
have
you
more
to
spend
while
hand
and
eye
and
something
of
a
heart
are
left
me
work
my
ware
and
what
it
worth
i
pay
my
fancy
only
let
me
sit
the
gray
remainder
of
the
evening
out
idle
you
call
it
and
muse
perfectly
how
i
could
paint
were
i
but
back
in
france
one
picture
just
one
more
the
virgin
face
not
yours
this
time
i
want
you
at
my
side
to
hear
them
that
is
michel
agnolo
judge
all
i
do
and
tell
you
of
its
worth
will
you
tomorrow
satisfy
your
friend
i
take
the
subjects
for
his
corridor
finish
the
portrait
out
of
hand
there
there
and
throw
him
in
another
thing
or
two
if
he
demurs
the
whole
should
prove
enough
to
pay
for
this
same
cousin
freak
beside
what
better
and
what
all
i
care
about
get
you
the
thirteen
scudi
for
the
ruff
love
does
that
please
you
ah
but
what
does
he
the
cousin
what
does
he
to
please
you
more
i
am
grown
peaceful
as
old
age
tonight
i
regret
little
i
would
change
still
less
since
there
my
past
life
lies
why
alter
it
the
very
wrong
to
francis
it
is
true
i
took
his
coin
was
tempted
and
complied
and
built
this
house
and
sinned
and
all
is
said
my
father
and
my
mother
died
of
want
well
had
i
riches
of
my
own
you
see
how
one
gets
rich
let
each
one
bear
his
lot
they
were
born
poor
lived
poor
and
poor
they
died
and
i
have
labored
somewhat
in
my
time
and
not
been
paid
profusely
some
good
son
paint
my
two
hundred
pictures
let
him
try
no
doubt
there
something
strikes
a
balance
yes
you
loved
me
quite
enough
it
seems
tonight
this
must
suffice
me
here
what
would
one
have
in
heaven
perhaps
new
chances
one
more
chance
four
great
walls
in
the
new
jerusalem
meted
on
each
side
by
the
angel
reed
for
leonard
rafael
agnolo
and
me
to
cover
the
three
first
without
a
wife
while
i
have
mine
so
still
they
overcome
because
there
still
lucrezia
as
i
choose
again
the
cousin
whistle
go
my
love
the
bishop
orders
his
tomb
at
saint
praxed
church
rome
vanity
saith
the
preacher
vanity
draw
round
my
bed
is
anselm
keeping
back
nephews
sons
mine
ah
god
i
know
not
well
she
men
would
have
to
be
your
mother
once
old
gandolf
envied
me
so
fair
she
was
what
done
is
done
and
she
is
dead
beside
dead
long
ago
and
i
am
bishop
since
and
as
she
died
so
must
we
die
ourselves
and
thence
ye
may
perceive
the
world
a
dream
life
how
and
what
is
it
as
here
i
lie
in
this
dying
by
degrees
hours
and
long
hours
in
the
dead
night
i
ask
do
i
live
am
i
dead
peace
peace
seems
all
saint
praxed
ever
was
the
church
for
peace
and
so
about
this
tomb
of
mine
i
fought
with
tooth
and
nail
to
save
my
niche
ye
know
old
gandolf
cozened
me
despite
my
care
shrewd
was
that
snatch
from
out
the
corner
south
he
graced
his
carrion
with
god
curse
the
same
yet
still
my
niche
is
not
so
cramped
but
thence
one
sees
the
pulpit
o
the
and
somewhat
of
the
choir
those
silent
seats
and
up
into
the
aery
dome
where
live
the
angels
and
a
sunbeam
sure
to
lurk
and
i
shall
fill
my
slab
of
basalt
there
and
my
tabernacle
take
my
rest
with
those
nine
columns
round
me
two
and
two
the
odd
one
at
my
feet
where
anselm
stands
marble
all
the
rare
the
ripe
as
red
wine
of
a
mighty
pulse
old
gandolf
with
his
paltry
put
me
where
i
may
look
at
him
true
peach
rosy
and
flawless
how
i
earned
the
prize
draw
close
that
conflagration
of
my
church
what
then
so
much
was
saved
if
aught
were
missed
my
sons
ye
would
not
be
my
death
go
dig
the
vineyard
where
the
stood
drop
water
gently
till
the
surface
sink
and
if
ye
find
ah
god
i
know
not
i
bedded
in
store
of
rotten
soft
and
corded
up
in
a
tight
some
lump
ah
god
of
big
as
a
jew
head
cut
off
at
the
nape
blue
as
a
vein
the
madonna
breast
sons
all
have
i
bequeathed
you
villas
all
that
brave
frascati
villa
with
its
bath
so
let
the
blue
lump
poise
between
my
knees
like
god
the
father
globe
on
both
his
hands
ye
worship
in
the
jesu
church
so
gay
for
gandolf
shall
not
choose
but
see
and
burst
swift
as
a
weaver
shuttle
fleet
our
years
man
goeth
to
the
grave
and
where
is
he
did
i
say
basalt
for
my
slab
sons
black
was
ever
i
meant
how
else
shall
ye
contrast
my
frieze
to
come
beneath
the
in
bronze
ye
promised
me
those
pan
and
nymphs
ye
wot
of
and
perchance
some
tripod
thyrsus
with
a
vase
or
so
the
savior
at
his
sermon
on
the
mount
saint
praxed
in
a
glory
and
one
pan
ready
to
twitch
the
nymph
last
garment
off
and
moses
with
the
tables
but
i
know
ye
mark
me
not
what
do
they
whisper
thee
child
of
my
bowels
anselm
ah
ye
hope
to
revel
down
my
villas
while
i
gasp
bricked
with
beggar
moldy
travertine
which
gandolf
from
his
chuckles
at
nay
boys
ye
love
me
all
of
jasper
then
is
jasper
ye
stand
pledged
to
lest
i
grieve
my
bath
must
needs
be
left
behind
alas
one
block
pure
green
as
a
there
plenty
jasper
somewhere
in
the
world
and
have
i
not
saint
praxed
ear
to
pray
horses
for
ye
and
brown
greek
manuscripts
and
mistresses
with
great
smooth
marbly
limbs
that
if
ye
carve
my
epitaph
aright
choice
latin
picked
phrase
tully
every
word
no
gaudy
ware
like
gandolf
second
line
tully
my
masters
ulpian
serves
his
need
and
then
how
i
shall
lie
through
centuries
and
hear
the
blessed
mutter
of
the
mass
and
see
god
made
and
eaten
all
day
long
and
feel
the
steady
and
taste
good
strong
thick
stupefying
for
as
i
lie
here
hours
of
the
dead
night
dying
in
state
and
by
such
slow
degrees
i
fold
my
arms
as
if
they
clasped
a
crook
and
stretch

in

acclaim
climbed
with

didst
engage

sake

ever
in

the
luring
hope
of
some
eventual
rest
of
it
whence
all
the
tumult
of
the
building
hushed
thou
first
of

mightst
look
out
to
the
east
the
vulgar
saw
thy
tower
thou
sawest
the
sun
for
this
i
promise
on
thy
festival
to
pour
libation
looking
the
sea
making
this
slave
narrate
thy
fortunes
speak
thy
great
words
and
describe
thy
royal
face
wishing
thee
wholly
where
zeus
lives
the
most
within
the
eventual
element
of
calm
thy
letter
first
requirement
meets
me
here
it
is
as
thou
hast
heard
in
one
short
life
i
cleon
have
effected
all
those
things
thou
wonderingly
dost
enumerate
that
epos
on
thy
hundred
plates
of
gold
is
mine
and
also
mine
the
little
chant
so
sure
to
rise
from
every
when
lights
at
prow
the
seamen
haul
their
net
the
image
of
the
on
the
phare
men
turn
from
the
sun
self
to
see
is
mine
the
poecile
its
whole
length
as
thou
didst
hear
with
painting
is
mine
too
i
know
the
true
proportions
of
a
man
and
woman
also
not
observed
before
and
i
have
written
three
books
on
the
soul
proving
absurd
all
written
hitherto
and
putting
us
to
ignorance
again
for
music
why
i
have
combined
the
moods
inventing
one
in
brief
all
arts
are
mine
thus
much
the
people
know
and
recognize
throughout
our
seventeen
islands
marvel
not
we
of
these
latter
days
with
greater
mind
than
our
forerunners
since
more
composite
look
not
so
great
beside
their
simple
way
to
a
judge
who
only
sees
one
way
at
once
one
and
no
other
at
a
time
compares
the
small
part
of
a
man
of
us
with
some
whole
man
of
the
heroic
age
great
in
his
way
not
ours
nor
meant
for
ours
and
ours
is
greater
had
we
skill
to
know
for
what
we
call
this
life
of
men
on
earth
this
sequence
of
the
soul
achievements
here
being
as
i
find
much
reason
to
conceive
intended
to
be
viewed
eventually
as
a
great
whole
not
analyzed
to
parts
but
each
part
having
reference
to
all
how
shall
a
certain
part
pronounced
complete
endure
effacement
by
another
part
was
the
thing
done
then
what
to
do
again
see
in
the
checkered
pavement
opposite
suppose
the
artist
made
a
perfect
rhomb
and
next
a
lozenge
then
a
trapezoid
he
did
not
overlay
them
superimpose
the
new
upon
the
old
and
blot
it
out
but
laid
them
on
a
level
in
his
work
making
at
last
a
picture
there
it
lies
so
first
the
perfect
separate
forms
were
made
the
portions
of
mankind
and
after
so
occurred
the
combination
of
the
same
for
where
had
been
a
progress
otherwise
mankind
made
up
of
all
the
single
men
in
such
a
synthesis
the
labor
ends
now
mark
me
those
divine
men
of
old
time
have
reached
thou
sayest
well
each
at
one
point
the
outside
verge
that
rounds
our
faculty
and
where
they
reached
who
can
do
more
than
reach
it
takes
but
little
water
just
to
touch
at
some
one
point
the
inside
of
a
sphere
and
as
we
turn
the
sphere
touch
all
the
rest
in
due
succession
but
the
finer
air
which
not
so
palpably
nor
obviously
though
no
less
universally
can
touch
the
whole
circumference
of
that
emptied
sphere
fills
it
more
fully
than
the
water
did
holds
thrice
the
weight
of
water
in
itself
resolved
into
a
subtler
element
and
yet
the
vulgar
call
the
sphere
first
full
up
to
the
visible
height
and
after
void
not
knowing
air
more
hidden
properties
and
thus
our
soul
misknown
cries
out
to
zeus
to
vindicate
his
purpose
in
our
life
why
stay
we
on
the
earth
unless
to
grow
long
since
i
imaged
wrote
the
fiction
out
that
he
or
other
god
descended
here
and
once
for
all
showed
simultaneously
what
in
its
nature
never
can
be
shown
piecemeal
or
in
succession
showed
i
say
the
worth
both
absolute
and
relative
of
all
his
children
from
the
birth
of
time
his
instruments
for
all
appointed
work
i
now
go
on
to
image
might
we
hear
the
judgment
which
should
give
the
due
to
each
show
where
the
labor
lay
and
where
the
ease
and
prove
zeus
self
the
latent
everywhere
this
is
a
dream
but
no
dream
let
us
hope
that
years
and
days
the
summers
and
the
springs
follow
each
other
with
unwaning
powers
the
grapes
which
dye
thy
wine
are
richer
far
through
culture
than
the
wild
wealth
of
the
rock
the
suave
plum
than
the
drupe
the
pastured
drops
choicer
sweet
the
flowers
turn
double
and
the
leaves
turn
flowers
that
young
and
tender
thy
slave
sleeping
above
her
robe
as
buoyed
by
clouds
refines
upon
the
women
of
my
youth
what
and
the
soul
alone
deteriorates
i
have
not
chanted
verse
like
homer
no
nor
swept
string
like
terpander
no
nor
carved
and
painted
men
like
phidias
and
his
friend
i
am
not
great
as
they
are
point
by
point
but
i
have
entered
into
sympathy
with
these
four
running
these
into
one
soul
who
separate
ignored
each
other
art
say
is
it
nothing
that
i
know
them
all
the
wild
flower
was
the
larger
i
have
dashed
upon
its
petals
pricked
its
honey
with
wine
and
driven
its
seed
to
fruit
and
show
a
better
flower
if
not
so
large
i
stand
myself
refer
this
to
the
gods
whose
gift
alone
it
is
which
shall
i
dare
all
pride
apart
upon
the
absurd
pretext
that
such
a
gift
by
chance
lay
in
my
hand
discourse
of
lightly
or
depreciate
it
might
have
fallen
to
another
hand
what
then
i
pass
too
surely
let
at
least
truth
stay
and
next
of
what
thou
followest
on
to
ask
this
being
with
me
as
i
declare
o
king
my
works
in
all
these
varicolored
kinds
so
done
by
me
accepted
so
by
men
thou
askest
if
my
soul
thus
in
men
hearts
i
must
not
be
accounted
to
attain
the
very
crown
and
proper
end
of
life
inquiring
thence
how
now
life
closeth
up
i
face
death
with
success
in
my
right
hand
whether
i
fear
death
less
than
dost
thyself
the
fortunate
of
men
for
writest
thou
thou
leavest
much
behind
while
i
leave
naught
thy
life
stays
in
the
poems
men
shall
sing
the
pictures
men
shall
study
while
my
life
complete
and
whole
now
in
its
power
and
joy
dies
altogether
with
my
brain
and
arm
is
lost
indeed
since
what
survives
myself
the
brazen
statue
to
my
grave
set
on
the
promontory
which
i
named
and
that
some
supple
courtier
of
my
heir
shall
use
its
robed
and
sceptered
arm
perhaps
to
fix
the
rope
to
which
best
drags
it
down
i
go
then
triumph
thou
who
dost
not
go
nay
thou
art
worthy
of
hearing
my
whole
mind
is
this
apparent
when
thou
to
muse
upon
the
scheme
of
earth
and
man
in
chief
that
admiration
grows
as
knowledge
grows
that
imperfection
means
perfection
hid
reserved
in
part
to
grace
the
if
in
the
morning
of
philosophy
ere
aught
had
been
recorded
nay
perceived
thou
with
the
light
now
in
thee
couldst
have
looked
on
all
earth
tenantry
from
worm
to
bird
ere
man
her
last
appeared
upon
the
stage
thou
wouldst
have
seen
them
perfect
and
deduced
the
perfectness
of
others
yet
unseen
conceding
which
had
zeus
then
questioned
thee
shall
i
go
on
a
step
improve
on
this
do
more
for
visible
creatures
than
is
done
thou
wouldst
have
answered
aye
by
making
each
grow
conscious
in
himself
by
that
alone
all
perfect
else
the
shell
sucks
fast
the
rock
the
fish
strikes
through
the
sea
the
snake
both
swims
and
slides
forth
range
the
beasts
the
birds
take
flight
till
life
mechanics
can
no
further
go
and
all
this
joy
in
natural
life
is
put
like
fire
from
off
thy
finger
into
each
so
exquisitely
perfect
is
the
same
but
is
pure
fire
and
they
mere
matter
are
it
has
them
not
they
it
and
so
i
choose
for
man
thy
last
premeditated
work
if
i
might
add
a
glory
to
the
scheme
that
a
third
thing
should
stand
apart
from
both
a
quality
arise
within
his
soul
which
introactive
made
to
supervise
and
feel
the
force
it
has
may
view
itself
and
so
be
happy
man
might
live
at
first
the
animal
life
but
is
there
nothing
more
in
due
time
let
him
critically
learn
how
he
lives
and
the
more
he
gets
to
know
of
his
own
life
adaptabilities
the
more
will
his
life
become
thus
man
who
hath
this
quality
is
best
but
thou
king
hadst
more
reasonably
said
let
progress
end
at
once
man
make
no
step
beyond
the
natural
man
the
better
beast
using
his
senses
not
the
sense
of
sense
in
man
there
failure
only
since
he
left
the
lower
and
inconscious
forms
of
life
we
called
it
an
advance
the
rendering
plain
man
spirit
might
grow
conscious
of
man
life
and
by
new
lore
so
added
to
the
old
take
each
step
higher
over
the
brute
head
this
grew
the
only
life
the
and
of
the
soul
which
whole
surrounding
flats
of
natural
life
seemed
only
fit
to
yield
subsistence
to
a
tower
that
crowns
a
country
but
alas
the
soul
now
climbs
it
just
to
perish
there
for
thence
we
have
discovered
is
no
dream
we
know
this
which
we
had
not
else
perceived
that
there
a
world
of
capability
for
joy
spread
round
about
us
meant
for
us
inviting
us
and
still
the
soul
craves
all
and
still
the
flesh
replies
take
no
jot
more
than
ere
thou
clombst
the
tower
to
look
abroad
nay
so
much
less
as
that
fatigue
has
brought
deduction
to
it
we
struggle
fain
to
enlarge
our
bounded
physical
recipiency
increase
our
power
supply
fresh
oil
to
life
repair
the
waste
of
age
and
sickness
no
it
skills
not
life
inadequate
to
joy
as
the
soul
sees
joy
tempting
life
to
take
they
praise
a
fountain
in
my
garden
here
wherein
a
naiad
sends
the
thin
from
her
tube
she
smiles
to
see
it
rise
what
if
i
told
her
it
is
just
a
thread
from
that
great
river
which
the
hills
shut
up
and
mock
her
with
my
leave
to
take
the
same
the
artificer
has
given
her
one
small
tube
past
power
to
widen
or
exchange
what
boots
to
know
she
might
spout
oceans
if
she
could
she
can
not
lift
beyond
her
first
thin
thread
and
so
a
man
can
use
but
a
man
joy
while
he
sees
god
is
it
for
zeus
to
boast
see
man
how
happy
i
live
and
despair
that
i
may
be
still
happier
for
thy
use
if
this
were
so
we
could
not
thank
our
lord
as
hearts
beat
on
to
doing
is
not
so
malice
it
is
not
is
it
carelessness
still
no
if
care
where
is
the
sign
i
ask
and
get
no
answer
and
agree
in
sum
o
king
with
thy
profound
discouragement
who
seest
the
wider
but
to
sigh
the
more
most
progress
is
most
failure
thou
sayest
well
the
last
point
now
thou
dost
except
a
case
holding
joy
not
impossible
to
one
with
to
such
a
man
as
i
who
leave
behind
me
living
works
indeed
for
such
a
poem
such
a
painting
lives
what
dost
thou
verily
trip
upon
a
word
confound
the
accurate
view
of
what
joy
is
caught
somewhat
clearer
by
my
eyes
than
thine
with
feeling
joy
confound
the
knowing
how
and
showing
how
to
live
my
faculty
with
actually
living
otherwise
where
is
the
artist
vantage
the
king
because
in
my
great
epos
i
display
how
divers
men
young
strong
fair
wise
can
act
is
this
as
though
i
acted
if
i
paint
carve
the
young
phoebus
am
i
therefore
young
methinks
i
older
that
i
bowed
myself
the
many
years
of
pain
that
taught
me
art
indeed
to
know
is
something
and
to
prove
how
all
this
beauty
might
be
enjoyed
is
more
but
knowing
naught
to
enjoy
is
something
too
yon
rower
with
the
molded
muscles
there
lowering
the
sail
is
nearer
it
than
i
i
can
write
thy
fair
slave
an
ode
i
get
to
sing
of
love
when
grown
too
gray
for
being
beloved
she
turns
to
that
young
man
the
muscles
all
on
his
back
i
know
the
joy
of
kingship
well
thou
art
king
but
sayest
thou
and
i
marvel
i
repeat
to
find
thee
trip
on
such
a
mere
word
what
thou
writest
paintest
stays
that
does
not
die
sappho
survives
because
we
sing
her
songs
and
æschylus
because
we
read
his
plays
why
if
they
live
still
let
them
come
and
take
thy
slave
in
my
despite
drink
from
thy
cup
speak
in
my
place
thou
diest
while
i
survive
say
rather
that
my
fate
is
deadlier
still
in
this
that
every
day
my
sense
of
joy
grows
more
acute
my
soul
intensified
by
power
and
insight
more
enlarged
more
keen
while
every
day
my
hairs
fall
more
and
more
my
hand
shakes
and
the
heavy
years
increase
the
horror
quickening
still
from
year
to
year
the
consummation
coming
past
escape
when
i
shall
know
most
and
yet
least
enjoy
when
all
my
works
wherein
i
prove
my
worth
being
present
still
to
mock
me
in
men
mouths
alive
still
in
the
praise
of
such
as
thou
i
i
the
feeling
thinking
acting
man
the
man
who
loved
his
life
so
overmuch
sleep
in
my
urn
it
is
so
horrible
i
dare
at
times
imagine
to
my
need
some
future
state
revealed
to
us
by
zeus
unlimited
in
capability
for
joy
as
this
is
in
desire
for
joy
to
seek
which
the
forces
us
that
stung
by
straitness
of
our
life
made
strait
on
purpose
to
make
prized
the
life
at
large
freed
by
the
throbbing
impulse
we
call
death
we
burst
there
as
the
worm
into
the
fly
who
while
a
worm
still
wants
his
wings
but
no
zeus
has
not
yet
revealed
it
and
alas
he
must
have
done
so
were
it
possible
live
long
and
happy
and
in
that
thought
die
glad
for
what
was
farewell
and
for
the
rest
i
can
not
tell
thy
messenger
aright
where
to
deliver
what
he
bears
of
thine
to
one
called
paulus
we
have
heard
his
fame
indeed
if
christus
be
not
one
with
him
i
know
not
nor
am
troubled
much
to
know
thou
canst
not
think
a
mere
barbarian
jew
as
paulus
proves
to
be
one
circumcised
hath
access
to
a
secret
shut
from
us
thou
wrongest
our
philosophy
o
king
in
stooping
to
inquire
of
such
an
one
as
if
his
answer
could
impose
at
all
he
writeth
doth
he
well
and
he
may
write
oh
the
jew
findeth
scholars
certain
slaves
who
touched
on
this
same
isle
preached
him
and
christ
and
as
i
gathered
from
a
bystander
their
doctrine
could
be
held
by
no
sane
man
one
word
more
i
there
they
are
my
fifty
men

me

rafael
made
a
century
of
sonnets
made
and
wrote
them
in
a
certain
volume
dinted
with
the
pencil
else
he
only
used
to
draw
madonnas
these
the
world
might
view
but
one
the
volume
who
that
one
you
ask
your
heart
instructs
you
did
she
live
and
love
it
all
her
lifetime
did
she
drop
his
lady
of
the
sonnets
die
and
let
it
drop
beside
her
pillow
where
it
lay
in
place
of
rafael
glory
rafael
cheek
so
duteous
and
so
loving
cheek
the
world
was
wont
to
hail
a
painter
rafael
cheek
her
love
had
turned
a
poet
iii
you
and
i
would
rather
read
that
volume
taken
to
his
beating
bosom
by
it
lean
and
list
the
of
rafael
would
we
not
than
wonder
at
madonnas
her
san
sisto
names
and
her
foligno
her
that
visits
florence
in
a
vision
her
that
left
with
lilies
in
the
louvre
seen
by
us
and
all
the
world
in
circle
iv
you

will
never
read

v
dante
once
prepared
to
paint
an
angel
whom
to
please
you
whisper
beatrice
while
he
mused
and
traced
it
and
retraced
it
peradventure
with
a
pen
corroded
still
by
drops
of
that
hot
ink
he
dipped
for
when
his
left
hand
i
the
hair
o
the
wicked
back
he
held
the
brow
and
pricked
its
stigma
bit
into
the
live
man
flesh
for
parchment
loosed
him
laughed
to
see
the
writing
rankle
let
the
wretch
go
festering
through
florence
dante
who
loved
well
because
he
hated
hated
wickedness
that
hinders
loving
dante
standing
studying
his
angel
in
there
broke
the
folk
of
his
inferno
says
he
certain
people
of
importance
such
he
gave
his
daily
dreadful
line
to
entered
and
would
seize
forsooth
the
poet
says
the
poet
then
i
stopped
my
painting
vi
you
and
i
would
rather
see
that
angel
painted
by
the
tenderness
of
dante
would
we
not
than
read
a
fresh
inferno
vii
you
and
i
will
never
see
that
picture
while
he
mused
on
love
and
beatrice
while
he
softened
his
outlined
angel
in
they
broke
those
people
of
importance
we
and
bice
bear
the
loss
forever

to
others

not
but
that
you
know
me
lo
the
moon
self
here
in
london
yonder
late
in
florence
still
we
find
her
face
the
curving
on
a
sky
imbrued
with
color
drifted
over
fiesole
by
twilight
came
she
our
new
crescent
of
a
full
she
flared
it
lamping
samminiato
rounder
the
cypresses
and
rounder
perfect
till
the
nightingales
applauded
now
a
piece
of
her
old
self
impoverished
hard
to
greet
she
traverses
the
hurries
with
unhandsome
thrift
of
silver
goes
dispiritedly
glad
to
finish
xvi
what
there
nothing
in
the
moon
noteworthy
nay
for
if
that
moon
could
love
a
mortal
use
to
charm
him
so
to
fit
a
fancy
all
her
magic
is
the
old
sweet
mythos
she
would
turn
a
new
side
to
her
mortal
side
unseen
of
herdsman
huntsman
steersman
blank
to
zoroaster
on
his
terrace
blind
to
galileo
on
his
turret
dumb
to
homer
dumb
to
keats
him
even
think
the
wonder
of
the
moonstruck
mortal
when
she
turns
round
comes
again
in
heaven
opens
out
anew
for
worse
or
better
proves
she
like
some
portent
of
an
iceberg
swimming
full
upon
the
ship
it
founders
hungry
with
huge
teeth
of
splintered
crystals
proves
she
as
the
paved
work
of
a
sapphire
seen
by
moses
when
he
climbed
the
mountain
moses
aaron
nadab
and
abihu
climbed
and
saw
the
very
god
the
highest
stand
upon
the
paved
work
of
a
sapphire
like
the
bodied
heaven
in
his
clearness
shone
the
stone
the
sapphire
of
that
paved
work
when
they
ate
and
drank
and
saw
god
also
xvii
what
were
seen
none
knows
none
ever
shall
know
only
this
is
sure
the
sight
were
other
not
the
moon
same
side
born
late
in
florence
dying
now
impoverished
here
in
london
god
be
thanked
the
meanest
of
his
creatures
boasts
two
one
to
face
the
world
with
one
to
show
a
woman
when
he
loves
her
xviii
this
i
say
of
me
but
think
of
you
love
this
to
you
yourself
my
moon
of
poets
ah
but
that
the
world
side
there
the
wonder
thus
they
see
you
praise
you
think
they
know
you
there
in
turn
i
stand
with
them
and
praise
you
out
of
my
own
self
i
dare
to
phrase
it
but
the
best
is
when
i
glide
from
out
them
cross
a
step
or
two
of
dubious
twilight
come
out
on
the
other
side
the
novel
silent
silver
lights
and
darks
undreamed
of
where
i
hush
and
bless
myself
with
silence
xix
oh
their
rafael
of
the
dear
madonnas
oh
their
dante
of
the
dread
inferno
wrote
one
song
and
in
my
brain
i
sing
it
drew
one
angel
borne
see
on
my
bosom
abt
vogler
after
he
has
been
extemporizing
upon
the
musical
instrument
of
his
invention
would
that
the
structure
brave
the
manifold
music
i
build
bidding
my
organ
obey
calling
its
keys
to
their
work
claiming
each
slave
of
the
sound
at
a
touch
as
when
solomon
willed
armies
of
angels
that
soar
legions
of
demons
that
lurk
man
brute
reptile
fly
alien
of
end
and
of
aim
adverse
each
from
the
other
removed
should
rush
into
sight
at
once
as
he
named
the
ineffable
name
and
pile
him
a
palace
straight
to
pleasure
the
princess
he
loved
would
it
might
tarry
like
his
the
beautiful
building
of
mine
this
which
my
keys
in
a
crowd
pressed
and
importuned
to
raise
ah
one
and
all
how
they
helped
would
dispart
now
and
now
combine
zealous
to
hasten
the
work
heighten
their
master
his
praise
and
one
would
bury
his
brow
with
a
blind
plunge
down
to
hell
burrow
awhile
and
build
broad
on
the
roots
of
things
then
up
again
swim
into
sight
having
based
me
my
palace
well
founded
it
fearless
of
flame
flat
on
the
nether
springs
and
another
would
mount
and
march
like
the
excellent
minion
he
was
aye
another
and
yet
another
one
crowd
but
with
many
a
crest
raising
my
rampired
walls
of
gold
as
transparent
as
glass
eager
to
do
and
die
yield
each
his
place
to
the
rest
for
higher
still
and
higher
as
a
runner
tips
with
fire
when
a
great
illumination
surprises
a
festal
night
outlining
round
and
round
rome
dome
from
space
to
spire
up
the
pinnacled
glory
reached
and
the
pride
of
my
soul
was
in
sight
in
sight
not
half
for
it
seemed
it
was
certain
to
match
man
birth
nature
in
turn
conceived
obeying
an
impulse
as
i
and
the
emulous
heaven
yearned
down
made
effort
to
reach
the
earth
as
the
earth
had
done
her
best
in
my
passion
to
scale
the
sky
novel
splendors
burst
forth
grew
familiar
and
dwelt
with
mine
not
a
point
nor
peak
but
found
and
fixed
its
wandering
star
balls
of
blaze
and
they
did
not
pale
nor
pine
for
earth
had
attained
to
heaven
there
was
no
more
near
nor
far
nay
more
for
there
wanted
not
who
walked
in
the
glare
and
glow
presences
plain
in
the
place
or
fresh
from
the
protoplast
furnished
for
ages
to
come
when
a
kindlier
wind
should
blow
lured
now
to
begin
and
live
in
a
house
to
their
liking
at
last
or
else
the
wonderful
dead
who
have
passed
through
the
body
and
gone
but
were
back
once
more
to
breathe
in
an
old
world
worth
their
new
what
never
had
been
was
now
what
was
as
it
shall
be
anon
and
what
is
shall
i
say
matched
both
for
i
was
made
perfect
too
all
through
my
keys
that
gave
their
sounds
to
a
wish
of
my
soul
all
through
my
soul
that
praised
as
its
wish
flowed
visibly
forth
all
through
music
and
me
for
think
had
i
painted
the
whole
why
there
it
had
stood
to
see
nor
the
process
so
had
i
written
the
same
made
verse
still
effect
proceeds
from
cause
ye
know
why
the
forms
are
fair
ye
hear
how
the
tale
is
told
it
is
all
triumphant
art
but
art
in
obedience
to
laws
painter
and
poet
are
proud
in
the
enrolled
but
here
is
the
finger
of
god
a
flash
of
the
will
that
can
existent
behind
all
laws
that
made
them
and
lo
they
are
and
i
know
not
if
save
in
this
such
gift
be
allowed
to
man
that
out
of
three
sounds
he
frame
not
a
fourth
sound
but
a
star
consider
it
well
each
tone
of
our
scale
in
itself
is
naught
it
is
everywhere
in
the
world
loud
soft
and
all
is
said
give
it
to
me
to
use
i
mix
it
with
two
in
my
thought
and
there
ye
have
heard
and
seen
consider
and
bow
the
head
well
it
is
gone
at
last
the
palace
of
music
i
reared
gone
and
the
good
tears
start
the
praises
that
come
too
slow
for
one
is
assured
at
first
one
scarce
can
say
that
he
feared
that
he
even
gave
it
a
thought
the
gone
thing
was
to
go
never
to
be
again
but
many
more
of
the
kind
as
good
nay
better
perchance
is
this
your
comfort
to
me
to
me
who
must
be
saved
because
i
cling
with
my
mind
to
the
same
same
self
same
love
same
god
aye
what
was
shall
be
therefore
to
whom
turn
i
but
to
thee
the
ineffable
name
builder
and
maker
thou
of
houses
not
made
with
hands
what
have
fear
of
change
from
thee
who
art
ever
the
same
doubt
that
thy
power
can
fill
the
heart
that
thy
power
expands
there
shall
never
be
one
lost
good
what
was
shall
live
as
before
the
evil
is
null
is
naught
is
silence
implying
sound
what
was
good
shall
be
good
with
for
evil
so
much
good
more
on
the
earth
the
broken
arcs
in
the
heaven
a
perfect
round
all
we
have
willed
or
hoped
or
dreamed
of
good
shall
exist
not
its
semblance
but
itself
no
beauty
nor
good
nor
power
whose
voice
has
gone
forth
but
each
survives
for
the
melodist
when
eternity
affirms
the
conception
of
an
hour
the
high
that
proved
too
high
the
heroic
for
earth
too
hard
the
passion
that
left
the
ground
to
lose
itself
in
the
sky
are
music
sent
up
to
god
by
the
lover
and
the
bard
enough
that
he
heard
it
once
we
shall
hear
it
and
what
is
our
failure
here
but
a
triumph
evidence
for
the
fullness
of
the
days
have
we
withered
or
agonized
why
else
was
the
pause
prolonged
but
that
singing
might
issue
thence
why
rushed
the
discords
in
but
that
harmony
should
be
prized
sorrow
is
hard
to
bear
and
doubt
is
slow
to
clear
each
sufferer
says
his
say
his
scheme
of
the
weal
and
woe
but
god
has
a
few
of
us
whom
he
whispers
in
the
ear
the
rest
may
reason
and
welcome
is
we
musicians
know
well
it
is
earth
with
me
silence
resumes
her
reign
i
will
be
patient
and
proud
and
soberly
acquiesce
give
me
the
keys
i
feel
for
the
common
chord
again
sliding
by
semitones
till
i
sink
to
the

and
i
blunt
it
into

i
stand
on

surveying
awhile

the

hark
i

i
shall
know

when

from

thou

as
thyself
sprawl
now
that
the
heat
of

is
best
flat
on
his
belly
in
the
pit
much
mire
with
elbows
wide
fists
clenched
to
prop
his
chin
and
while
he
kicks
both
feet
in
the
cool
slush
and
feels
about
his
spine
small
course
run
in
and
out
each
arm
and
make
him
laugh
and
while
above
his
head
a
coating
the
as
a
brow
its
eye
creeps
down
to
touch
and
tickle
hair
and
beard
and
now
a
flower
drops
with
a
bee
inside
and
now
a
fruit
to
snap
at
catch
and
crunch
he
looks
out
yon
sea
which
sunbeams
cross
and
recross
till
they
weave
a
spider
web
meshes
of
fire
some
great
fish
breaks
at
times
and
talks
to
his
own
self
he
please
touching
that
other
whom
his
dam
called
god
because
to
talk
about
him
vexes
ha
could
he
but
know
and
time
to
vex
is
now
when
talk
is
safer
than
in
wintertime
moreover
prosper
and
miranda
sleep
in
confidence
he
drudges
at
their
task
and
it
is
good
to
cheat
the

and
gibe
letting
the
rank
tongue
blossom
into
speech
setebos
setebos
and
setebos
he
dwelleth
i
the
cold
o
the
moon
thinketh
he
made
it
with
the
sun
to
match
but
not
the
stars
the
stars
came
otherwise
only
made
clouds
winds
meteors
such
as
that
also
this
isle
what
lives
and
grows
thereon
and
snaky
sea
which
rounds
and
ends
the
same
it
came
of
being
ill
at
ease
he
hated
that
he
can
not
change
his
cold
nor
cure
its
ache
spied
an
icy
fish
that
longed
to
the
where
she
lived
and
thaw
herself
within
the
lukewarm
brine
o
the
lazy
sea
her
stream
thrusts
far
amid
a
crystal
spike
two
warm
walls
of
wave
only
she
ever
sickened
found
repulse
at
the
other
kind
of
water
not
her
life
and
bred
o
the
sun
flounced
back
from
bliss
she
was
not
born
to
breathe
and
in
her
old
bounds
buried
her
despair
hating
and
loving
warmth
alike
so
he
he
made
thereat
the
sun
this
isle
trees
and
the
fowls
here
beast
and
creeping
thing
yon
otter
black
lithe
as
a
leech
yon
auk
one
in
a
ball
of
foam
that
floats
and
feeds
a
certain
badger
brown
he
hath
watched
hunt
with
that
slant
eye
by
moonlight
and
the
pie
with
the
long
tongue
that
pricks
deep
into
oakwarts
for
a
worm
and
says
a
plain
word
when
she
finds
her
prize
but
will
not
eat
the
ants
the
ants
themselves
that
build
a
wall
of
seeds
and
settled
stalks
about
their
hole
he
made
all
these
and
more
made
all
we
see
and
us
in
spite
how
else
he
could
not
himself
make
a
second
self
to
be
his
mate
as
well
have
made
himself
he
would
not
make
what
he
mislikes
or
slights
an
eyesore
to
him
or
not
worth
his
pains
but
did
in
envy
listlessness
or
sport
make
what
himself
would
fain
in
a
manner
be
weaker
in
most
points
stronger
in
a
few
worthy
and
yet
mere
playthings
all
the
while
things
he
admires
and
mocks
too
that
is
it
because
so
brave
so
better
though
they
be
it
nothing
skills
if
he
begin
to
plague
look
now
i
melt
a
into
mash
add
honeycomb
and
pods
i
have
perceived
which
bite
like
finches
when
they
bill
and
kiss
then
when
froth
rises
bladdery
drink
up
all
quick
quick
till
maggots
scamper
through
my
brain
last
throw
me
on
my
back
i
the
seeded
thyme
and
wanton
wishing
i
were
born
a
bird
put
case
unable
to
be
what
i
wish
i
yet
could
make
a
live
bird
out
of
clay
would
not
i
take
clay
pinch
my
caliban
able
to
fly
for
there
see
he
hath
wings
and
great
comb
like
the
hoopoe
to
admire
and
there
a
sting
to
do
his
foes
offense
there
and
i
will
that
he
begin
to
live
fly
to
yon
nip
me
off
the
horns
of
grigs
high
up
that
make
the
merry
din
saucy
through
their
veined
wings
and
mind
me
not
in
which
feat
if
his
leg
snapped
brittle
clay
and
he
lay
why
i
should
laugh
and
if
he
spying
me
should
fall
to
weep
beseech
me
to
be
good
repair
his
wrong
bid
his
poor
leg
smart
less
or
grow
again
well
as
the
chance
were
this
might
take
or
else
not
take
my
fancy
i
might
hear
his
cry
and
give
the
manikin
three
sound
legs
for
one
or
pluck
the
other
off
leave
him
like
an
egg
and
lessoned
he
was
mine
and
merely
clay
were
this
no
pleasure
lying
in
the
thyme
drinking
the
mash
with
brain
become
alive
making
and
marring
clay
at
will
so
he
such
shows
nor
right
nor
wrong
in
him
nor
kind
nor
cruel
he
is
strong
and
lord
strong
myself
compared
to
yonder
crabs
that
march
now
from
the
mountain
to
the
sea
twenty
pass
and
stone
the
loving
not
hating
not
just
choosing
so
the
first
straggler
that
boasts
purple
spots
shall
join
the
file
one
pincer
twisted
off
this
bruised
fellow
shall
receive
a
worm
and
two
worms
he
whose
nippers
end
in
red
as
it
likes
me
each
time
i
do
so
he
well
then
he
is
good
i
the
main
placable
if
his
mind
and
ways
were
guessed
but
rougher
than
his
handiwork
be
sure
oh
he
hath
made
things
worthier
than
himself
and
envieth
that
so
helped
such
things
do
more
than
he
who
made
them
what
consoles
but
this
that
they
unless
through
him
do
naught
at
all
and
must
submit
what
other
use
in
things
cut
a
pipe
of
pithless
that
blown
through
gives
exact
the
scream
o
the
jay
when
from
her
wing
you
twitch
the
feathers
blue
sound
this
and
little
birds
that
hate
the
jay
flock
within
stone
throw
glad
their
foe
is
hurt
put
case
such
pipe
could
prattle
and
boast
forsooth
i
catch
the
birds
i
am
the
crafty
thing
i
make
the
cry
my
maker
can
not
make
with
his
great
round
mouth
he
must
blow
through
mine
would
not
i
smash
it
with
my
foot
so
he
but
wherefore
rough
why
cold
and
ill
at
ease
aha
that
is
a
question
ask
for
that
what
knows
the
something
over
setebos
that
made
him
or
he
may
be
found
and
fought
worsted
drove
off
and
did
to
nothing
perchance
there
may
be
something
quiet
his
head
out
of
his
reach
that
feels
nor
joy
nor
grief
since
both
derive
from
weakness
in
some
way
i
joy
because
the
quails
come
would
not
joy
could
i
bring
quails
here
when
i
have
a
mind
this
quiet
all
it
hath
a
mind
to
doth
stars
the
outposts
of
its
couch
but
never
spends
much
thought
nor
care
that
way
it
may
look
up
work
up
the
worse
for
those
it
works
on
but
for
setebos
the
as
a
cuttlefish
who
making
himself
feared
through
what
he
does
looks
up
first
and
perceives
he
can
not
soar
to
what
is
quiet
and
hath
happy
life
next
looks
down
here
and
out
of
very
spite
makes
this
a
to
ape
yon
real
these
good
things
to
match
those
as
hips
do
grapes
is
solace
making
baubles
aye
and
sport
himself
peeped
late
eyed
prosper
at
his
books
careless
and
lofty
lord
now
of
the
isle
vexed
a
book
of
broad
leaves
wrote
thereon
he
knows
what
prodigious
words
has
peeled
a
wand
and
called
it
by
a
name
weareth
at
whiles
for
an
enchanter
robe
the
eyed
skin
of
a
supple
oncelot
and
hath
an
ounce
sleeker
than
youngling
mole
a
serpent
he
makes
cower
and
couch
now
snarl
now
hold
its
breath
and
mind
his
eye
and
saith
she
is
miranda
and
my
wife
for
his
ariel
a
tall
crane
he
bids
go
wade
for
fish
and
straight
disgorge
also
a
lumpish
which
he
snared
blinded
the
eyes
of
and
brought
somewhat
tame
and
split
its
and
now
pens
the
drudge
in
a
hole
o
the
rock
and
calls
him
caliban
a
bitter
heart
that
bides
its
time
and
bites
thus
at
being
prosper
in
a
way
taketh
his
mirth
with
so
he
his
dam
held
that
the
quiet
made
all
things
which
setebos
vexed
only
not
so
who
made
them
weak
meant
weakness
he
might
vex
had
he
meant
other
while
his
hand
was
in
why
not
make
horny
eyes
no
thorn
could
prick
or
plate
my
scalp
with
bone
against
the
snow
or
overscale
my
flesh
joint
and
joint
like
an
orc
armor
aye
so
spoil
his
sport
he
is
the
one
now
only
he
doth
all
he
may
like
perchance
what
profits
him
aye
himself
loves
what
does
him
good
but
why
good
no
otherwise
this
blinded
beast
loves
whoso
places
fleshmeat
on
his
nose
but
had
he
eyes
would
want
no
help
but
hate
or
love
just
as
it
liked
him
he
hath
eyes
also
it
pleaseth
setebos
to
work
use
all
his
hands
and
exercise
much
craft
by
no
means
for
the
love
of
what
is
worked
himself
no
finer
good
i
the
world
when
all
goes
right
in
this
safe
summertime
and
he
wants
little
hungers
aches
not
much
than
trying
what
to
do
with
wit
and
strength
to
make
something
yon
pile
of
turfs
and
squared
and
stuck
there
squares
of
soft
white
chalk
and
with
a
scratched
a
moon
on
each
and
set
up
endwise
certain
spikes
of
tree
and
crowned
the
whole
with
a
sloth
skull
found
dead
i
the
woods
too
hard
for
one
to
kill
no
use
at
all
i
the
work
for
work
sole
sake
some
day
knock
it
down
again
so
he
he
is
terrible
watch
his
feats
in
proof
one
hurricane
will
spoil
six
good
months
hope
he
hath
a
spite
against
me
that
i
know
just
as
he
favors
prosper
who
knows
why
so
it
is
all
the
same
as
well
i
find
wattles
half
the
winter
fenced
them
firm
with
stone
and
stake
to
stop
crawling
to
lay
their
eggs
here
well
one
wave
feeling
the
foot
of
him
upon
its
neck
gaped
as
a
snake
does
lolled
out
its
large
tongue
and
licked
the
whole
labor
flat
so
much
for
spite
a
ball
flame
down
late
yonder
it
lies
where
half
an
hour
before
i
slept
i
the
shade
often
they
scatter
sparkles
there
is
force
up
a
newt
he
may
have
envied
once
and
turned
to
stone
shut
up
inside
a
stone
please
him
and
hinder
this
what
prosper
does
aha
if
he
would
tell
me
how
not
he
there
is
the
sport
discover
how
or
die
all
need
not
die
for
of
the
things
o
the
isle
some
flee
afar
some
dive
some
run
up
trees
those
at
his
mercy
why
they
please
him
most
when
when
well
never
try
the
same
way
twice
repeat
what
act
has
pleased
he
may
grow
wroth
you
must
not
know
his
ways
and
play
him
off
sure
of
the
issue
the
like
himself
a
squirrel
that
it
nothing
fears
but
steals
the
nut
from
underneath
my
thumb
and
when
i
threat
bites
stoutly
in
defense
an
urchin
that
contrariwise
curls
up
into
a
ball
pretending
death
for
fright
at
my
approach
the
two
ways
please
but
what
would
move
my
choler
more
than
this
that
either
creature
counted
on
its
life
tomorrow
and
next
day
and
all
days
to
come
saying
forsooth
in
the
inmost
of
its
heart
because
he
did
so
yesterday
with
me
and
otherwise
with
such
another
brute
so
must
he
do
henceforth
and
aye
would
teach
the
reasoning
couple
what
must
means
as
he
likes
or
wherefore
lord
so
he
all
things
will
continue
thus
and
we
shall
have
to
live
in
fear
of
him
so
long
as
he
lives
keeps
his
strength
no
change
if
he
have
done
his
best
make
no
new
world
to
please
him
more
so
leave
off
watching
this
if
he
surprise
not
even
the
quiet
self
some
strange
day
or
suppose
grow
into
it
as
grubs
grow
butterflies
else
here
are
we
and
there
is
he
and
nowhere
help
at
all
with
the
life
the
pain
shall
stop
his
dam
held
different
that
after
death
he
both
plagued
enemies
and
feasted
friends
idly
he
doth
his
worst
in
this
our
life
giving
just
respite
lest
we
die
through
pain
saving
last
pain
for
worst
with
which
an
end
meanwhile
the
best
way
to
escape
his
ire
is
not
to
seem
too
happy
himself
yonder
two
flies
with
purple
films
and
pink
bask
on
the
above
kills
both
two
black
painful
beetles
roll
their
ball
on
head
and
tail
as
if
to
save
their
lives
moves
them
the
stick
away
they
strive
to
clear
even
so
have
him
misconceive
suppose
this
caliban
strives
hard
and
ails
no
less
and
always
above
all
else
envies
him
wherefore
he
mainly
dances
on
dark
nights
moans
in
the
sun
gets
under
holes
to
laugh
and
never
speaks
his
mind
save
housed
as
now
outside
curses
if
he
caught
me
here
this
speech
and
asked
what
chucklest
at
to
appease
him
cut
a
finger
off
or
of
my
three
kid
yearlings
burn
the
best
or
let
the
toothsome
apples
rot
on
tree
or
push
my
tame
beast
for
the
orc
to
taste
while
myself
lit
a
fire
and
made
a
song
and
sung
it
i
hate
be
consecrate
to
celebrate
thee
and
thy
state
no
mate
for
thee
what
see
for
envy
in
poor
me
hoping
the
while
since
evils
sometimes
mend
warts
rub
away
and
sores
are
cured
with
slime
that
some
strange
day
will
either
the
quiet
catch
and
conquer
setebos
or
likelier
he
decrepit
may
doze
doze
as
good
as
die
what
what
a
curtain
the
world
at
once
crickets
stop
hissing
not
a
bird
or
yes
there
scuds
his
raven
that
has
told
him
all
it
was
fool
play
this
prattling
ha
the
wind
shoulders
the
pillared
dust
death
house
o
the
move
and
fast
invading
fires
begin
white
blaze
a
tree
head
snaps
and
there
there
there
there
there
his
thunder
follows
fool
to
gibe
at
him
lo
flat
and
loveth
setebos
his
teeth
meet
through
his
upper
lip
will
let
those
quails
fly
will
not
eat
this
month
one
little
mess
of
whelks
so
he
may
may
and
death
i
wish
that
when
you
died
last
may
charles
there
had
died
along
with
you
three
parts
of
spring
delightful
things
aye
and
for
me
the
fourth
part
too
a
foolish
thought
and
worse
perhaps
there
must
be
many
a
pair
of
friends
who
arm
in
arm
deserve
the
warm
and
the
long
so
for
their
sake
be
may
still
may
let
their
new
time
as
mine
of
old
do
all
it
did
for
me
i
bid
sweet
sights
and
sounds
throng
manifold
only
one
little
sight
one
plant
woods
have
in
may
that
starts
up
green
save
a
sole
streak
which
so
to
speak
is
spring
blood
spilt
its
leaves
between
that
they
might
spare
a
certain
wood
might
miss
the
plant
their
loss
were
small
but
i
the
leaf
grows
there
its
drop
comes
from
my
heart
that
all
prospice
fear
death
to
feel
the
fog
in
my
throat
the
mist
in
my
face
when
the
snows
begin
and
the
blasts
denote
i
am
nearing
the
place
the
power
of
the
night
the
press
of
the
storm
the
post
of
the
foe
where
he
stands
the
arch
fear
in
a
visible
form
yet
the
strong
man
must
go
for
the
journey
is
done
and
the
summit
attained
and
the
barriers
fall
though
a
battle
to
fight
ere
the
guerdon
be
gained
the
reward
of
it
all
i
was
ever
a
fighter
so
one
fight
more
the
best
and
the
last
i
would
hate
that
death
bandaged
my
eyes
and
forbore
and
bade
me
creep
past
no
let
me
taste
the
whole
of
it
fare
like
my
peers
the
heroes
of
old
bear
the
brunt
in
a
minute
pay
glad
life
arrears
of
pain
darkness
and
cold
for
sudden
the
worst
turns
the
best
to
the
brave
the
black
minute
at
end
and
the
elements
rage
the
that
rave
shall
dwindle
shall
blend
shall
change
shall
become
first
a
peace
out
of
pain
then
a
light
then
thy
breast
o
thou
soul
of
my
soul
i
shall
clasp
thee
again
and
with
god
be
the
rest
a
face
if
one
could
have
that
little
head
of
hers
painted
upon
a
background
of
pale
gold
such
as
the
tuscan
early
art
prefers
no
shade
encroaching
on
the
matchless
mold
of
those
two
lips
which
should
be
opening
soft
in
the
pure
profile
not
as
when
she
laughs
for
that
spoils
all
but
rather
as
if
aloft
yon
hyacinth
she
loves
so
leaned
its
burthen
of
buds
to
kiss
and
capture
the
lips
apart
for
this
then
her
lithe
neck
three
fingers
might
surround
how
it
should
waver
on
the
pale
gold
ground
up
to
the
perfect
chin
it
lifts
i
know
correggio
loves
to
mass
in
rifts
of
heaven
his
angel
faces
orb
on
orb
breaking
its
outline
burning
shades
absorb
but
these
are
only
massed
there
i
should
think
waiting
to
see
some
wonder
momently
grow
out
stand
full
fade
slow
against
the
sky
that
the
pale
ground
you
see
this
sweet
face
by
all
heaven
meanwhile
condensed
into
one
eye
which
fears
to
lose
the
wonder
should
it
wink
o
lyric
love
o
lyric
love
half
angel
and
half
bird
and
all
a
wonder
and
a
wild
desire
boldest
of
hearts
that
ever
braved
the
sun
took
sanctuary
within
the
holier
blue
and
sang
a
kindred
soul
out
to
his
face
yet
human
at
the
of
the
heart
when
the
first
summons
from
the
darkling
earth
reached
thee
amid
thy
chambers
blanched
their
blue
and
bared
them
of
the
glory
to
drop
down
to
toil
for
man
to
suffer
or
to
die
this
is
the
same
voice
can
thy
soul
know
change
hail
then
and
hearken
from
the
realms
of
help
never
may
i
commence
my
song
my
due
to
god
who
best
taught
song
by
gift
of
thee
except
with
bent
head
and
beseeching
hand
that
still
despite
the
distance
and
the
dark
what
was
again
may
be
some
interchange
of
grace
some
splendor
once
thy
very
thought
some
benediction
anciently
thy
smile
never
conclude
but
raising
hand
and
head
thither
where
eyes
that
can
not
reach
yet
yearn
for
all
hope
all
sustainment
all
reward
their
utmost
up
and
on
so
blessing
back
in
those
thy
realms
of
help
that
heaven
thy
home
some
whiteness
which
i
judge
thy
face
makes
proud
some
wanness
where
i
think
thy
foot
may
fall
prologue
to
pacchiarotto
oh
the
old
wall
here
how
i
could
pass
life
in
a
long
midsummer
day
my
feet
confined
to
a
plot
of
grass
my
eyes
from
a
wall
not
once
away
and
lush
and
lithe
do
the
creepers
clothe
yon
wall
i
watch
with
a
wealth
of
green
its
bald
red
bricks
draped
nothing
loth
in
lappets
of
tangle
they
laugh
between
now
what
is
it
makes
pulsate
the
robe
why
tremble
the
sprays
what
life
the
body
the
house
no
eye
can
probe
divined
as
beneath
a
robe
the
limbs
and
there
again
but
my
heart
may
guess
who
tripped
behind
and
she
sang
perhaps
so
the
old
wall
throbbed
and
its
life
excess
died
out
and
away
in
the
leafy
wraps
wall
upon
wall
are
between
us
life
and
song
should
away
from
heart
to
heart
i
with
a
ruddy
strife
at
breast
and
a
lip
whence
start
hold
on
hope
hard
in
the
subtle
thing
that
spirit
though
cloistered
fast
soar
free
account
as
wood
brick
stone
this
ring
of
the
rueful
neighbors
and
forth
to
thee
house
shall
i
you
about
myself
do
i
live
in
a
house
you
would
like
to
see
is
it
scant
of
gear
has
it
store
of
pelf
unlock
my
heart
with
a
invite
the
world
as
my
betters
have
done
take
notice
this
building
remains
on
view
its
suites
of
reception
every
one
its
private
apartment
and
bedroom
too
for
a
ticket
apply
to
the
publisher
no
thanking
the
public
i
must
decline
a
peep
through
my
window
if
folk
prefer
but
please
you
no
foot
over
threshold
of
mine
i
have
mixed
with
a
crowd
and
heard
free
talk
in
a
foreign
land
where
an
earthquake
chanced
and
a
house
stood
gaping
naught
to
balk
man
eye
wherever
he
gazed
or
glanced
the
whole
of
the
frontage
shaven
sheer
the
inside
gaped
exposed
to
day
right
and
wrong
and
common
and
queer
bare
as
the
palm
of
your
hand
it
lay
the
owner
oh
he
had
been
crushed
no
doubt
odd
tables
and
chairs
for
a
man
of
wealth
what
a
parcel
of
musty
old
books
about
he
smoked
no
wonder
he
lost
his
health
i
doubt
if
he
bathed
before
he
dressed
a
brasier
the
pagan
he
burned
perfumes
you
see
it
is
proved
what
the
neighbors
guessed
his
wife
and
himself
had
separate
rooms
friends
the
goodman
of
the
house
at
least
kept
house
to
himself
till
an
earthquake
came
is
the
fall
of
its
frontage
permits
you
feast
on
the
inside
arrangement
you
praise
or
blame
outside
should
suffice
for
evidence
and
whoso
desires
to
penetrate
deeper
must
dive
by
the
no
optics
like
yours
at
any
rate
a
street
to
explore
your
house
the
exception
this
same
key
shakespeare
unlocked
his
once

if
so
the
less
shakespeare
he
shop
so
friend
your
shop
was
all
your
house
its
front
astonishing
the
street
invited
view
from
man
and
mouse
to
what
diversity
of
treat
behind
its

the
single

what
gimcracks
genuine
japanese
and
the
frog
dragons
owls
monkeys
beetles
geese
some

queer

such
a

i
thought

he
who

ah
could
i
peep
at
him
by
stealth
behind
his

pass
shop
intrude
on
house
itself
what
scenes
were
viewed

showy
thus
the

what
must
the

prove
the
true

with
no

the

distant
one
remove

get
him
off
his

he

perhaps
and
as
for

to
these

on

did
the

foremost
of

damfreville
close

fled

guidance
give

harbor
take
us
quick
or
quicker
still
here
the

iii
then
the
pilots
of
the

put
out
brisk
and
leapt
on

why
what

then
was
called

would

no

no

what

hervé

as
he
stepped
in

once
more
not
a
symptom
of
surprise
in
the
frank
blue
breton
eyes
just
the
same
man
as
before
ix
then
said
damfreville
my
friend
i
must
speak
out
at
the
end
though
i
find
the
speaking
hard
praise
is
deeper
than
the
lips
you
have
saved
the
king
his
ships
you
must
name
your
own
reward
our
sun
was
near

demand
you
will
france
remains
your

still
ask
to
heart
content

then
a

of

outbroke

with

till

came

that

epilogue
to
the
two
poets
of
croisic
what
a
pretty
tale
you
told
me
once
upon
a
time
said
you
found
it
somewhere
scold
me
was
it
prose
or
was
it
rhyme
greek
or
latin
greek
you
said
while
your
shoulder
propped
my
head
anyhow
there
no
forgetting
this
much
if
no
more
that
a
poet
pray
no
petting
yes
a
bard
sir
famed
of
yore
went
where
suchlike
used
to
go
singing
for
a
prize
you
know
well
he
had
to
sing
nor
merely
sing
but
play
the
lyre
playing
was
important
clearly
quite
as
singing
i
desire
sir
you
keep
the
fact
in
mind
for
a
purpose
that
behind
there
stood
he
while
deep
attention
held
the
judges
round
judges
able
i
should
mention
to
detect
the
slightest
sound
sung
or
played
amiss
such
ears
had
old
judges
it
appears
none
the
less
he
sang
out
boldly
played
in
time
and
tune
till
the
judges
weighing
coldly
each
note
worth
seemed
late
or
soon
sure
to
smile
in
vain
one
tries
picking
faults
out
take
the
prize
when
a
mischief
were
they
seven
strings
the
lyre
possessed
oh
and
afterwards
eleven
thank
you
well
sir
who
had
guessed
such
ill
luck
in
store
it
happed
one
of
those
same
seven
strings
snapped
all
was
lost
then
no
a
cricket
what
cicada
pooh
some
mad
thing
that
left
its
thicket
for
mere
love
of
music
flew
with
its
little
heart
on
fire
lighted
on
the
crippled
lyre
so
that
when
ah
joy
our
singer
for
his
truant
string
feels
with
disconcerted
finger
what
does
cricket
else
but
fling
fiery
heart
forth
sound
the
note
wanted
by
the
throbbing
throat
aye
and
ever
to
the
ending
cricket
chirps
at
need
executes
the
hand
intending
promptly
perfectly
indeed
saves
the
singer
from
defeat
with
her
chirrup
low
and
sweet
till
at
ending
all
the
judges
cry
with
one
assent
take
the
prize
a
prize
who
grudges
such
a
voice
and
instrument
why
we
took
your
lyre
for
harp
so
it
shrilled
us
forth
f
sharp
did
the
conqueror
spurn
the
creature
once
its
service
done
that
no
such
uncommon
feature
in
the
case
when
music
son
finds
his
lotte
power
too
spent
for
aiding
no
this
other
on
returning
homeward
prize
in
hand
satisfied
his
bosom
yearning
sir
i
hope
you
understand
said
some
record
there
must
be
of
this
cricket
help
to
me
so
he
made
himself
a
statue
marble
stood
on
the
lyre
he
pointed
at
you
perched
his
partner
in
the
prize
never
more
apart
you
found
her
he
throned
from
him
she
crowned
that
the
tale
its
application
somebody
i
know
hopes
one
day
for
reputation
through
his
poetry
that
oh
all
so
learned
and
so
wise
and
deserving
of
a
prize
if
he
gains
one
will
some
ticket
when
his
statue
built
tell
the
gazer
was
a
cricket
helped
my
crippled
lyre
whose
lilt
sweet
and
low
when
strength
usurped
softness
place
i
the
scale
she
chirped
for
as
victory
was
nighest
while
i
sang
and
played
with
my
lyre
at
lowest
highest
right
alike
one
string
that
made
sound
soft
was
snapped
in
twain
never
to
be
heard
again
had
not
a
kind
cricket
fluttered
perched
upon
the
place
vacant
left
and
duly
uttered
love
love
the
bass
asked
the
treble
to
atone
for
its
somewhat
somber
drone
but
you
do
know
music
wherefore
keep
on
casting
pearls
to
a
poet
all
i
care
for
is
to
tell
him
that
a
love
comes
aptly
in
when
gruff
grows

singing

thy

i

moldered
to

that

off
off

away
was
i

not
one

have
ye

fade
at

you
that

rather
i

thee
parnes

thy

tract
treeless
herbless
lifeless
mountain
what
matter
if
slacked
my

may
hardly
be

homage
to
crag
and
to

no

deigns
to

at

i
can
breathe
fear
in
thee
no
fraud
from
the
blind
no
lie
from
the
mute
such
my
cry
as
rapid
i
ran
over
parnes
ridge
gully
and
gap
i
clambered
and
cleared
till
sudden
a
bar
jutted
a
stoppage
of
stone
against
me
blocking
the
way
right
for
i
minded
the
hollow
to
traverse
the
fissure
across
where
i
could
enter
there
i
depart
by

in

athens
to

and
the

again
a
field
which
a
fire
runs
through
till
in
he
broke
rejoice
we
conquer
like
wine
through

joy
in
his

bursting
his

he
died
the
bliss
so
to
this
day
when

the
word
of
salute
is
still
rejoice
his
word
which
brought
rejoicing
indeed
so

noble
strong
man
who
could
race
like

bear
the

of
a

a

loved
so
well
he
saw
the
land
saved
he
had
helped
to
save
and
was
suffered
to
tell
such
tidings
yet
never
decline
but
gloriously
as
he
began
so
to
end
gloriously
once
to
shout
thereafter
be
mute
athens
is
saved
pheidippides
dies
in
the
shout
for
his
meed
muléykeh
if
a

passed
the

he
cried
a
churl

help
the
man
who
has
neither
salt
nor

nay
would
a

exclaim
he

nor

more
than
who
spends
small
thought
on
the
picking
pearls
holds
but
in
light
esteem
the
bears
instead
on
his
breast
a
prize
some
orb
which
of
night
makes
morn
what
if
no

enrich
the

an
oath

the

is
a
prize
apart
lo
duhl
the

what
good
avails
to
the
another

and
hist
what
craft
is
it
duhl
designs
he
alights
not
at
the
door
of
the
tent
as
he
did
last
time
but
creeping
behind
he
gropes
his
stealthy
way
by
the
trench
till
he
finds
the
flap
in
the
folding
for
night
combines
with
the
robber
and
such
is
he
duhl
covetous
up
to
crime
must
wring
from
hóseyn
grasp
the
pearl
by
whatever
the
wrench
he
was
i
heard
i
tempted
with
half
my
store
and
a
gibe
was
all
my
thanks
is
he
generous
like
spring

me
who
chaffered
with
such
an
one
he
has
killed
to

chance
comers
the
creature
he
rode
nay
more
for
a
couple
of
his

has
he
torn
in

i
will
beg
yet
i
nowise
gained
by
the
tale
of
my
wife
and
son
i
swear
by
the
holy
house
my
head
will
i
never
wash
till
i
filch
his
pearl
away
fair
dealing
i
tried
then
guile
and
now
i
resort
to
force
he
said
we
must
live
or
die
let
him
die
then
let
me
live
be
bold
but
not
too
rash
i
have
found
me
a
breast
bury
your
breathing
while
i
explore
for
myself
now
breathe
he
deceived
me
not
the
spy
as
he
said
there
lies
in
peace
hóseyn
how
happy
beside
stands
tethered
the
pearl
thrice
winds
her
headstall
about
his
wrist
is
therefore
he
sleeps
so
sound
the
moon
through
the
roof
reveals
and
loose
on
his
left
stands
too
that
other
known
far
and
wide
buhéyseh
her
sister
born
fleet
is
she
yet
ever
missed
the
winning
tail
past
the
thunderous
heels
no
less
she
stands
saddled
and
bridled
this
second
in
case
some
thief
should
enter
and
seize
and
fly
with
the
first
as
i
mean
to
do
what
then
the
pearl
is
the
pearl
once
mount
her
we
both
escape
through
the
in
glides
duhl
so
a
serpent
disturbs
no
leaf
in
a
bush
as
he
parts
the
twigs
entwining
a
nest
clean
through
he
is
noiselessly
at
his
work
as
he
planned
he
performs
the
rape
he
has
set
the
wide
has
buckled
the
girth
has
clipped
the
headstall
away
from
the
wrist
he
leaves
thrice
bound
as
before
he
springs
on
the
pearl
is
launched
on
the
desert
like
bolt
from
bow
up
starts
our
plundered
man
from
his
breast
though
the
heart
be
ripped
yet
his
mind
has
the
mastery
behold
in
a
minute
more
he
is
out
and
off
and
away
on
buhéyseh
whose
worth
we
know
and
hóseyn
his
blood
turns
flame
he
has
learned
long
since
to
ride
and
buhéyseh
does
her
part
they
gain
they
are
gaining
fast
on
the
fugitive
pair
and
duhl
has
to
cross
and
quit
and
to
reach
the
ridge
no
safety
till
that
be
spied
and
buhéyseh
is
bound
by
bound
but
a
off
at
last
for
the
pearl
has
missed
the
tap
of
the
heel
the
touch
of
the
bit
she
shortens
her
stride
she
chafes
at
her
rider
the
strange
and
queer
buhéyseh
is
mad
with
hope
beat
sister
she
shall
and
must
though
duhl
of
the
hand
and
heel
so
clumsy
she
has
to
thank
she
is
near
now
nose
by
tail
they
are
neck
by
croup
joy
fear
what
folly
makes
hóseyn
shout
dog
duhl
damned
son
of
the
dust
touch
the
right
ear
and
press
with
your
foot
my
pearl
left
flank
and
duhl
was
wise
at
the
word
and
muléykeh
as
prompt
perceived
who
was
urging
redoubled
pace
and
to
hear
him
was
to
obey
and
a
leap
indeed
gave
she
and
evanished
for
evermore
and
hóseyn
looked
one
long
last
look
as
who
all
bereaved
looks
fain
to
follow
the
dead
so
far
as
the
living
may
then
he
turned
buhéyseh
neck
slow
homeward
weeping
sore
and
lo
in
the
sunrise
still
sat
hóseyn
upon
the
ground
weeping
and
neighbors
came
the
tribesmen
of
in
the
vale
of
green
and
they
questioned
him
of
his
grief
and
he
told
from
first
to
last
how
duhl
had
wound
his
way
to
the
nest
and
how
duhl
rode
like
an
ape
so
bad
and
how
buhéyseh
did
wonders
yet
pearl
remained
with
the
thief
and
they
jeered
him
one
and
all
poor
hóseyn
is
crazed
past
hope
how
else
had
he
wrought
himself
his
ruin
in
fortune
spite
to
have
simply
held
the
tongue
were
a
task
for
boy
or
girl
and
here
were
muléykeh
again
the
eyed
like
an
antelope
the
child
of
his
heart
by
day
the
wife
of
his
breast
by
night
and
the
beaten
in
speed
wept
hóseyn
you
never
have
loved
my
pearl
wanting
is
what
wanting
is
what
summer
redundant
blueness
abundant
where
is
the
blot
beamy
the
world
yet
a
blank
all
the
same
framework
which
waits
for
a
picture
to
frame
what
of
the
leafage
what
of
the
flower
roses
embowering
with
naught
they
embower
come
then
complete
incompletion
o
comer
pant
through
the
blueness
perfect
the
summer
breathe
but
one
breath
above
and
all
that
was
death
grows
life
grows
love
grows
love
never
the
time
and
the
place
never
the
time
and
the
place
and
the
loved
one
all
together
this
path
how
soft
to
pace
this
may
what
magic
weather
where
is
the
loved
one
face
in
a
dream
that
loved
one
face
meets
mine
but
the
house
is
narrow
the
place
is
bleak
where
outside
rain
and
wind
combine
with
a
furtive
ear
if
i
strive
to
speak
with
a
hostile
eye
at
my
flushing
cheek
with
a
malice
that
marks
each
word
each
sign
o
enemy
sly
and
serpentine
uncoil
thee
from
the
waking
man
do
i
hold
the
past
thus
firm
and
fast
yet
doubt
if
the
future
hold
i
can
this
path
so
soft
to
pace
shall
lead
through
the
magic
of
may
to
herself
indeed
or
narrow
if
needs
the
house
must
be
outside
are
the
storms
and
strangers
we
oh
close
safe
warm
sleep
i
and
she
i
and
she
the
patriot
it
was
roses
roses
all
the
way
with
myrtle
mixed
in
my
path
like
mad
the
seemed
to
heave
and
sway
the
flamed
such
flags
they
had
a
year
ago
on
this
very
day
the
air
broke
into
a
mist
with
bells
the
old
walls
rocked
with
the
crowd
and
cries
had
i
said
good
folk
mere
noise
repels
but
give
me
your
sun
from
yonder
skies
they
had
answered
and
afterward
what
else
alack
it
was
i
who
leaped
at
the
sun
to
give
it
my
loving
friends
to
keep
naught

could
do
have
i
left
undone
and
you
see
my
harvest
what
i
reap
this
very
day
now
a
year
is
run
there
nobody
on
the
housetops
now
just
a
palsied
few
at
the
windows
set
for
the
best
of
the
sight
is
all
allow
at
the
shambles
gate
or
better
yet
by
the
very
scaffold
foot
i
trow
i
go
in
the
rain
and
more
than
needs
a
rope
cuts
both
my
wrists
behind
and
i
think
by
the
feel
my
forehead
bleeds
for
they
fling
whoever
has
a
mind
stones
at
me
for
my
year
misdeeds
thus
i
entered
and
thus
i
go
in
triumphs
people
have
dropped
down
dead
paid
by
the
world
what
dost
thou
owe
me
god
might
question
now
instead
is
god
shall
repay
i
am
safer
so
instans
tyrannus
i
of
the
million
or
two
more
or
less
i
rule
and
possess
one
man
for
some
cause
undefined
was
least
to
my
mind
ii
i
struck
him
he
groveled
of
course
for
what
was
his
force
i
pinned
him
to
earth
with
my
weight
and
persistence
of
hate
and
he
lay
would
not
moan
would
not
curse
as
his
lot
might
be
worse
iii
were
the
object
less
mean
would
he
stand
at
the
swing
of
my
hand
for
obscurity
helps
him
and
blots
the
hole
where
he
squats
so
i
set
my
five
wits
on
the
stretch
to
inveigle
the
wretch
all
in
vain
gold
and
jewels
i
threw
still
he
couched
there
perdue
i
tempted
his
blood
and
his
flesh
hid
in
roses
my
mesh
choicest
cates
and
the
flagon
best
spilth
still
he
kept
to
his
filth
iv
had
he
kith
now
or
kin
were
access
to
his
heart
did
i
press
just
a
son
or
a
mother
to
seize
no
such
booty
as
these
were
it
simply
a
friend
to
pursue
my
million
or
two
who
could
pay
me
in
person
or
pelf
what
he
owes
me
himself
no
i
could
not
but
smile
through
my
chafe
for
the
fellow
lay
safe
as
his
mates
do
the
midge
and
the
nit
through
minuteness
to
wit
v
then
a
humor
more
great
took
its
place
at
the
thought
of
his
face
the
droop
the
low
cares
of
the
mouth
the
trouble
uncouth
the
brows
all
that
air
one
is
fain
to
put
out
of
its
pain
and
no
i
admonished
myself
is
one
mocked
by
an
elf
is
one
baffled
by
toad
or
by
rat
the
gravamen
in
that
how
the
lion
who
crouches
to
suit
his
back
to
my
foot
would
admire
that
i
stand
in
debate
but
the
small
turns
the
great
if
it
vexes
you
that
is
the
thing
toad
or
rat
vex
the
king
though
i
waste
half
my
realm
to
unearth
toad
or
rat
is
well
worth
vi
so
i
soberly
laid
my
last
plan
to
extinguish
the
man
round
his
with
never
a
break
ran
my
fires
for
his
sake
overhead
did
my
thunder
combine
with
my
underground
mine
till
i
looked
from
my
labor
content
to
enjoy
the
event
vii
when
sudden
how
think
ye
the
end
did
i
say
without
friend
say
rather
from
marge
to
blue
marge
the
whole
sky
grew
his
targe
with
the
sun
self
for
visible
boss
while
an
arm
ran
across
which
the
earth
heaved
beneath
like
a
breast
where
the
wretch
was
safe
pressed
do
you
see
just
my
vengeance
complete
the
man
sprang
to
his
feet
stood
erect
caught
at
god
skirts
and
prayed
so
was
afraid
the
italian
in
england
that
second
time
they
hunted
me
from
hill
to
plain
from
shore
to
sea
and
austria
hounding
far
and
wide
her
bloodhounds
through
the
countryside
breathed
hot
and
instant
on
my
trace
i
made
six
days
a
of
that
dry
green
old
aqueduct
where
i
and
charles
when
boys
have
plucked
the
fireflies
from
the
roof
above
bright
creeping
through
the
moss
they
love
how
long
it
seems
since
charles
was
lost
six
days
the
soldiers
crossed
and
crossed
the
country
in
my
very
sight
and
when
that
peril
ceased
at
night
the
sky
broke
out
in
red
dismay
with
signal
fires
well
there
i
lay
close
covered
in
my
recess
up
to
the
neck
in
ferns
and
cress
thinking
of
metternich
our
friend
and
charles
miserable
end
and
much
beside
two
days
the
third
hunger
me
when
i
heard
the
peasants
from
the
village
go
to
work
among
the
maize
you
know
with
us
in
lombardy
they
bring
provisions
packed
on
mules
a
string
with
little
bells
that
cheer
their
task
and
casks
and
boughs
on
every
cask
to
keep
the
sun
heat
from
the
wine
these
i
let
pass
in
jingling
line
and
close
on
them
dear
noisy
crew
the
peasants
from
the
village
too
for
at
the
very
rear
would
troop
their
wives
and
sisters
in
a
group
to
help
i
knew
when
these
had
passed
i
threw
my
glove
to
strike
the
last
taking
the
chance
she
did
not
start
much
less
cry
out
but
stooped
apart
one
instant
rapidly
glanced
round
and
saw
me
beckon
from
the
ground
a
wild
bush
grows
and
hides
my
crypt
she
picked
my
glove
up
while
she
stripped
a
branch
off
then
rejoined
the
rest
with
that
my
glove
lay
in
her
breast
then
i
drew
breath
they
disappeared
it
was
for
italy
i
feared
an
hour
and
she
returned
alone
exactly
where
my
glove
was
thrown
meanwhile
came
many
thoughts
on
me
rested
the
hopes
of
italy
i
had
devised
a
certain
tale
which
when
was
told
her
could
not
fail
persuade
a
peasant
of
its
truth
i
meant
to
call
a
freak
of
youth
this
hiding
and
give
hopes
of
pay
and
no
temptation
to
betray
but
when
i
saw
that
woman
face
its
calm
simplicity
of
grace
our
italy
own
attitude
in
which
she
walked
thus
far
and
stood
planting
each
naked
foot
so
firm
to
crush
the
snake
and
spare
the
worm
at
first
sight
of
her
eyes
i
said
i
am
that
man
upon
whose
head
they
fix
the
price
because
i
hate
the
austrians
over
us
the
state
will
give
you
gold
oh
gold
so
much
if
you
betray
me
to
their
clutch
and
be
your
death
for
aught
i
know
if
once
they
find
you
saved
their
foe
now
you
must
bring
me
food
and
drink
and
also
paper
pen
and
ink
and
carry
safe
what
i
shall
write
to
padua
which
you
reach
at
night
before
the
duomo
shuts
go
in
and
wait
till
tenebræ
begin
walk
to
the
third
confessional
between
the
pillar
and
the
wall
and
kneeling
whisper
comes
peace
say
it
a
second
time
then
cease
and
if
the
voice
inside
returns
christ
and
freedom
what
cause
of
peace
for
answer
slip
my
letter
where
you
placed
your
lip
then
come
back
happy
we
have
done
our
mother
service
i
the
son
as
you
the
daughter
of
our
land
three
mornings
more
she
took
her
stand
in
the
same
place
with
the
same
eyes
i
was
no
surer
of
sunrise
than
of
her
coming
we
conferred
of
her
own
prospects
and
i
heard
she
had
a
lover
stout
and
tall
she
said
then
let
her
eyelids
fall
he
could
do
much
as
if
some
doubt
entered
her
heart
then
passing
out
she
could
not
speak
for
others
who
had
other
thoughts
herself
she
knew
and
so
she
brought
me
drink
and
food
after
four
days
the
scouts
pursued
another
path
at
last
arrived
the
help
my
paduan
friends
contrived
to
furnish
me
she
brought
the
news
for
the
first
time
i
could
not
choose
but
kiss
her
hand
and
lay
my
own
upon
her
head
this
faith
was
shown
to
italy
our
mother
she
uses
my
hand
and
blesses
thee
she
followed
down
to
the
seashore
i
left
and
never
saw
her
more
how
very
long
since
i
have
thought
concerning
much
less
wished
for
aught
beside
the
good
of
italy
for
which
i
live
and
mean
to
die
i
never
was
in
love
and
since
charles
proved
false
what
shall
now
convince
my
inmost
heart
i
have
a
friend
however
if
i
pleased
to
spend
real
wishes
on
myself
say
three
i
know
at
least
what
one
should
be
i
would
grasp
metternich
until
i
felt
his
red
wet
throat
distill
in
blood
through
these
two
hands
and
next
nor
much
for
that
am
i
perplexed
charles
perjured
traitor
for
his
part
should
die
slow
of
a
broken
heart
under
his
new
employers
last
ah
there
what
should
i
wish
for
fast
do
i
grow
old
and
out
of
strength
if
i
resolved
to
seek
at
length
my
father
house
again
how
scared
they
all
would
look
and
unprepared
my
brothers
live
in
austria
pay
disowned
me
long
ago
men
say
and
all
my
early
mates
who
used
to
praise
me
so
perhaps
induced
more
than
one
early
step
of
mine
are
turning
wise
while
some
opine
freedom
grows
license
some
suspect
haste
breeds
delay
and
recollect
they
always
said
such
premature
beginnings
never
could
endure
so
with
a
sullen
all
for
best
the
land
seems
settling
to
its
rest
i
think
then
i
should
wish
to
stand
this
evening
in
that
dear
lost
land
over
the
sea
the
thousand
miles
and
know
if
yet
that
woman
smiles
with
the
calm
smile
some
little
farm
she
lives
in
there
no
doubt
what
harm
if
i
sat
on
the
bench
and
while
her
spindle
made
a
trench
fantastically
in
the
dust
inquired
of
all
her
fortunes
just
her
children
ages
and
their
names
and
what
may
be
the
husband
aims
for
each
of
them
i
talk
this
out
and
sit
there
for
an
hour
about
then
kiss
her
hand
once
more
and
lay
mine
on
her
head
and
go
my
way
so
much
for
idle
wishing
how
it
steals
the
time
to
business
now
round
us
the
wild
creatures
round
us
the
wild
creatures
overhead
the
trees
underfoot
the

and

these

if
midday
shed
a
gloom
jules
and
phene
what
care
bride
and
groom
save
for
their
dear
selves
is
their
and
while
they
leave
church
and
go
home
their
way
hand
clasping
hand
within
each
breast
would
be
sunbeams
and
pleasant
weather
spite
of
thee
then
for
another
trial
obscure
thy
eve
with
mist
will
luigi
and
his
mother
grieve
the
lady
and
her
child
unmatched
forsooth
she
in
her
age
as
luigi
in
his
youth
for
true
content
the
cheerful
town
warm
close
and
safe
the
sooner
that
thou
art
morose
receives
them
and
yet
once
again
outbreak
in
storm
at
night
on
monsignor
they
make
such
stir
about
whom
they
expect
from
rome
to
visit
asolo
his
brothers
home
and
say
here
masses
proper
to
release
a
soul
from
pain
what
storm
dares
hurt
his
peace
calm
would
he
pray
with
his
own
thoughts
to
ward
thy
thunder
off
nor
want
the
angels
guard
but
pippa
just
one
such
mischance
would
spoil
her
day
that
lightens
the
next
toil
at
wearisome
coil
on
coil
and
here
i
let
time
slip
for
naught
aha
you
foolhardy
sunbeam
caught
with
a
single
splash
from
my
ewer
you
that
would
mock
the
best
pursuer
was
my
basin
one
splash
of
water
ruins
you
asleep
and
up
up
fleet
your
brilliant
bits
wheeling
and
counterwheeling
reeling
broken
beyond
healing
now
grow
together
on
the
ceiling
that
will
task
your
wits
whoever
it
was
quenched
fire
first
hoped
to
see
morsel
after
morsel
flee
as
merrily
as
giddily
meantime
what
lights
my
sunbeam
on
where
settles
by
degrees
the
radiant
cripple
oh
is
it
surely
blown
my
martagon
and
ruddy
as
agnes
nipple
plump
as
the
on
some
turk
bird
poll
be
sure
if
corals
branching
the
ripple
of
ocean
bud
there
fairies
watch
unroll
such
i
say
such
lamps
disperse
thick
red
flame
through
that
dusk
green
universe
i
am
queen
of
thee
floweret
and
each
fleshy
blossom
preserve
i
not
safer
than
leaves
that
embower
it
or
shells
that
embosom
from
weevil
and
chafer
laugh
through
my
pane
then
solicit
the
bee
gibe
him
be
sure
and
in
midst
of
thy
glee
love
thy
queen
worship
me
worship
whom
else
for
am
i
not
this
day
i
please
what
shall
i
please
today
my
morn
noon
eve
and
night
how
spend
my
day
tomorrow
i
must
be
pippa
who
winds
silk
the
whole
year
round
to
earn
just
bread
and
milk
but
this
one
day
i
have
leave
to
go
and
play
out
my
fancy
fullest
games
i
may
fancy
all
day
and
it
shall
be
so
that
i
taste
of
the
pleasures
am
called
by
the
names
of
the
happiest
four
in
our
asolo
see
up
the
hillside
yonder
through
the
morning
someone
shall
love
me
as
the
world
calls
love
i
am
no
less
than
ottima
take
warning
the
gardens
and
the
great
stone
house
above
and
other
house
for
shrubs
all
glass
in
front
are
mine
where
sebald
steals
as
he
is
wont
to
court
me
while
old
luca
yet
reposes
and
therefore
till
the
door
uncloses
i
what
now
give
abundant
cause
for
prate
about
me
ottima
i
mean
of
late
too
bold
too
confident
she
still
face
down
the
spitefullest
of
talkers
in
our
town
how
we
talk
in
the
little
town
below
but
love
love
love
there
better
love
i
know
this
foolish
love
was
only
day
first
offer
i
choose
my
next
love
to
defy
the
scoffer
for
do
not
our
bride
and
bridegroom
sally
out
of
possagno
church
at
noon
their
house
looks
over
orcana
valley
why
should
not
i
be
the
bride
as
soon
as
ottima
for
i
saw
beside
arrive
last
night
that
little
bride
saw
if
you
call
it
seeing
her
one
flash
of
the
pale
cheek
and
black
bright
tresses
blacker
than
all
except
the
black
eyelash
i
wonder
she
contrives
those
lids
no
dresses
so
strict
was
she
the
veil
should
cover
close
her
pale
pure
cheeks
a
bride
to
look
at
and
scarce
touch
scarce
touch
remember
jules
for
are
not
such
used
to
be
tended
every
feature
as
if
one
breath
would
fray
the
lily
of
a
creature
a
soft
and
easy
life
these
ladies
lead
whiteness
in
us
were
wonderful
indeed
oh
save
that
brow
its
virgin
dimness
keep
that
foot
its
lady
primness
let
those
ankles
never
swerve
from
their
exquisite
reserve
yet
have
to
trip
along
the
streets
like
me
all
but
naked
to
the
knee
how
will
she
ever
grant
her
jules
a
bliss
so
startling
as
her
real
first
infant
kiss
oh
no
not
envy
this
not
envy
sure
for
if
you
gave
me
leave
to
take
or
to
refuse
in
earnest
do
you
think
i
choose
that
sort
of
new
love
to
enslave
me
mine
should
have
lapped
me
round
from
the
beginning
as
little
fear
of
losing
it
as
winning
lovers
grow
cold
men
learn
to
hate
their
wives
and
only
parents
love
can
last
our
lives
at
eve
the
son
and
mother
gentle
pair
commune
inside
our
turret
what
prevents
my
being
luigi
while
that
mossy
lair
of
lizards
through
the
wintertime
is
stirred
with
each
to
each
imparting
sweet
intents
for
this
as
brooding
bird
to
bird
for
i
observe
of
late
the
evening
walk
of
luigi
and
his
mother
always
ends
inside
our
ruined
turret
where
they
talk
calmer
than
lovers
yet
more
kind
than
friends
let
me
be
cared
about
kept
out
of
harm
and
schemed
for
safe
in
love
as
with
a
charm
let
me
be
luigi
if
i
only
knew
what
was
my
mother
face
my
father
too
nay
if
you
come
to
that
best
love
of
all
is
god
then
why
not
have
god
love
befall
myself
as
in
the
palace
by
the
dome
monsignor
who
tonight
will
bless
the
home
of
his
dead
brother
and
god
bless
in
turn
that
heart
which
beats
those
eyes
which
mildly
burn
with
love
for
all
men
i
tonight
at
least
would
be
that
holy
and
beloved
priest
now
wait
even
i
already
seem
to
share
in
god
love
what
does
hymn
declare
what
other
meaning
do
these
verses
bear
service
ranks
the
same
with
god
now
as
formerly
he
his
presence
earth
each
only
as
god
work
god
puppets
best
and
worst
we
there
is
no
last
nor
not
a
small
event
why
small
it
more
pain
that
this
ye
great
event
should
come
to
pass
that
untwine
me
from
the
deeds
which
make
up
life
one
shall
fall
short
in
or
exceed
and
more
of
it
and
more
of
it
oh
yes
i
will
pass
each
and
see
their
happiness
and
envy
none
being
just
as
great
no
doubt
useful
to
men
and
dear
to
god
as
they
a
pretty
thing
to
care
about
so
mightily
this
single
holiday
but
let
the
sun
shine
wherefore
repine
with
thee
to
lead
me
o
day
of
mine
down
the
grass
path
gray
with
dew
under
the
blind
with
boughs
where
the
swallow
never
flew
nor
yet
cicala
dared
carouse
no
dared
carouse
enters
the
i
morning
the
hillside
inside
the
luca
ottima
her
paramour
the
sebald
the
watching
lids
wink
day
ablaze
with
eyes
think
deep
into
the
night
drink
night
such
may
be
your
rhineland
nights
perhaps
but
this
beam
through
the
shutter
chink
we
call
such
light
the
morning
let
us
see
mind
how
you
grope
your
way
though
how
these
tall
naked
geraniums
straggle
push
the
lattice
behind
that
frame
nay
do
i
bid
you
sebald
it
shakes
the
dust
down
on
me
why
of
course
the
catches
well
are
you
content
or
must
i
find
you
something
else
to
spoil
kiss
and
be
friends
my
sebald
is
full
morning
oh
do
speak
then
aye
thus
it
used
to
be
ever
your
house
was
i
remember
shut
till
midday
i
observed
that
as
i
strolled
on
mornings
through
the
vale
here
country
girls
were
noisy
washing
garments
in
the
brook
hinds
drove
the
slow
white
oxen
up
the
hills
but
no
your
house
was
mute
would
ope
no
eye
and
wisely
you
were
plotting
one
thing
there
nature
another
outside
i
looked
up
rough
white
wood
shutters
rusty
iron
bars
silent
as
death
blind
in
a
flood
of
light
oh
i
remember
and
the
peasants
laughed
and
said
the
old
man
sleeps
with
the
young
wife
this
house
was
his
this
chair
this
window
his
ah
the
clear
morning
i
can
see
mark
that
black
streak
is
the
belfry
stop
vicenza
should
lie
there
padua
plain
enough
that
blue
look
my
shoulder
follow
my
finger
morning
it
seems
to
me
a
night
with
a
sun
added
where
dew
where
freshness
that
bruised
plant
i
bruised
in
getting
through
the
lattice
yestereve
droops
as
it
did
see
here
my
elbow
mark
i
the
dust
o
the
sill
oh
shut
the
lattice
pray
let
me
lean
out
i
can
not
scent
blood
here
foul
as
the
morn
may
be
there
shut
the
world
out
how
do
you
feel
now
ottima
there
curse
the
world
and
all
outside
let
us
throw
off
this
mask
how
do
you
bear
yourself
let
out
with
all
of
it
best
never
speak
of
it
best
speak
again
and
yet
again
of
it
till
words
cease
to
be
more
than
words
his
blood
for
instance
let
those
two
words
mean
his
blood
and
nothing
more
notice
i
say
them
now
his
blood
assuredly
if
i
repented
the
deed
repent
who
should
repent
or
why
what
puts
that
in
your
head
did
i
once
say
that
i
repented
no
i
said
the
deed
the
deed
and
the
event
just
now
it
was
our
passion
fruit
the
devil

such
cant
say
once
and
always

business
from
the
duomo

the
capuchin
with
his
brown
hood
and
bare
feet
always
in
one
place
at
church
close
under
the
stone
wall
by
the
south
entry
i
used
to
take
him
for
a
brown
cold
piece
of
the
wall
self
as
out
of
it
he
rose
to
let
me
pass
at
first
i
say
i
used
now
so
has
that
dumb
figure
fastened
on
me
i
rather
should
account
the
plastered
wall

piece
of
him

chilly
does
it
strike
this
sebald
no
the
white
wine
the
white
wine

ottima
i
promised
no
new
year
should
rise
on
us
the
ancient
shameful
way
nor
does
it
rise
pour
on
to
your
black
eyes
do
you
remember
last
damned
new
year
day
you
brought
those
foreign
prints
we
looked
at
them
over
the
wine
and
fruit
i
had
to
scheme
to
get
him
from
the
fire
nothing
but
saying
his
own
set
wants

roused
him
up
to
hunt
them
out
he
is
not
alive
to
fondle
you
before
my
face
do
you
fondle
me
then
who
means
to
take
your
life
for
that
my
sebald
hark
you
ottima
one
thing
to
guard
against
we
not
make
much
one
of
the
other
that
is
not
make
more
parade
of
warmth
childish
officious
coil
than
yesterday
as
if
sweet
i
supposed
proof
upon
proof
were
needed
now
now
first
to
show
i
love
you
yes
still
love
you
love
you
in
spite
of
luca
and
what
come
to
him
sure
sign
we
had
him
ever
in
our
thoughts
white
sneering
old
reproachful
face
and
all
we
even
quarrel
love
at
times
as
if
we
still
could
lose
each
other
were
not
tied
by
this
conceive
you
love
not
tied
so
sure
because
though
i
was
wrought
upon
have
struck
his
insolence
back
into
him
am
i
so
surely
yours
therefore
forever
yours
love
to
be
wise
one
counsel
pays
another
should
we
have
months
ago
when
first
we
loved
for
instance
that
may
morning
we
two
stole
under
the
green
ascent
of
sycamores
if
we
had
come
upon
a
thing
like
that
suddenly
a
thing
there
again
a
thing
then
venus
body
had
we
come
upon
my
husband
luca
gaddi
murdered
corpse
within
there
at
his
covered
close
would
you
have
pored
upon
it
why
persist
in
poring
now
upon
it
for
is
here
as
much
as
there
in
the
deserted
house
you
can
not
rid
your
eyes
of
it
for
me
now
he
is
dead
i
hate
him
worse
i
hate
dare
you
stay
here
i
would
go
back
and
hold
his
two
dead
hands
and
say
i
hate
you
worse
luca
than
off
off
take
your
hands
off
mine
is
the
hot
evening
off
oh
morning
is
it
there
one
thing
must
be
done
you
know
what
thing
come
in
and
help
to
carry
we
may
sleep
anywhere
in
the
whole
wide
house
tonight
what
would
come
think
you
if
we
let
him
lie
just
as
he
is
let
him
lie
there
until
the
angels
take
him
he
is
turned
by
this
off
from
his
face
beside
as
you
will
see
this
dusty
pane
might
serve
for
three
four
four
gray
hairs
is
it
so
you
said
a
plait
of
hair
should
wave
across
my
neck
no
this
way
ottima
i
would
give
your
neck
each
splendid
shoulder
both
those
breasts
of
yours
that
this
were
undone
killing
kill
the
world
so
luca
lives
again
aye
lives
to
sputter
his
fulsome
dotage
on
you
yes
and
feign
surprise
that
i
return
at
eve
to
sup
when
all
the
morning
i
was
loitering
here
bid
me
dispatch
my
business
and
begone
i
would
see
no
i
finish
do
you
think
i
fear
to
speak
the
bare
truth
once
for
all
all
we
have
talked
of
is
at
bottom
fine
to
suffer
there
a
recompense
in
guilt
one
must
be
venturous
and
fortunate
what
is
one
young
for
else
in
age
we
sigh
the
wild
reckless
wicked
days
flown
over
still
we
have
lived
the
vice
was
in
its
place
but
to
have
eaten
luca
bread
have
worn
his
clothes
have
felt
his
money
swell
my
purse
do
lovers
in
romances
sin
that
way
why
i
was
starving
when
i
used
to
call
and
teach
you
music
starving
while
you
plucked
me
these
flowers
to
smell
my
poor
lost
friend
he
gave
me
life
nothing
else
what
if
he
did
reproach
my
perfidy
and
threaten
and
do
more
had
he
no
right
what
was
to
wonder
at
he
sat
by
us
at
table
quietly
why
must
you
lean
across
till
our
cheeks
touched
could
he
do
less
than
make
pretense
to
strike
is
not
the
crime
sake
i
commit
ten
crimes
greater
to
have
this
crime
wiped
out
undone
and
you
oh
how
feel
you
feel
you
for
me
well
then
i
love
you
better
now
than
ever
and
best
look
at
me
while
i
speak
to
you
best
for
the
crime
nor
do
i
grieve
in
truth
this
mask
this
simulated
ignorance
this
affectation
of
simplicity
falls
off
our
crime
this
naked
crime
of
ours
may
not
now
be
looked
over
look
it
down
great
let
it
be
great
but
the
joys
it
brought
pay
they
or
no
its
price
come
they
or
it
speak
not
the
past
would
you
give
up
the
past
such
as
it
is
pleasure
and
crime
together
give
up
that
noon
i
owned
my
love
for
you
the
garden
silence
even
the
single
bee
persisting
in
his
toil
suddenly
stopped
and
where
he
hid
you
only
could
surmise
by
some
campanula
chalice
set
who
stammered
yes
i
love
you
and
i
drew
back
put
far
back
your
face
with
both
my
hands
lest
you
should
grow
too
full
of
me
your
face
so
seemed
athirst
for
my
whole
soul
and
body
and
when
i
ventured
to
receive
you
here
made
you
steal
hither
in
the
mornings
when
i
used
to
look
up
the
here
till
the
red
fire
on
its
glazed
windows
spread
to
a
yellow
haze
ah
my
sign
was
the
sun
inflamed
the
sear
side
of
yon
nipped
by
the
first
frost
you
would
always
laugh
at
my
wet
boots
i
had
to
stride
through
grass
over
my
ankles
then
our
crowning
night
the
july
night
the
day
of
it
too
sebald
when
heaven
pillars
seemed
with
heat
its
canopy
suffered
descend
close
on
us
both
to
weigh
down
each
to
each
and
smother
up
all
life
except
our
life
so
lay
we
till
the
storm
came
how
it
came
buried
in
woods
we
lay
you
recollect
swift
ran
the
searching
tempest
overhead
and
ever
and
anon
some
bright
white
shaft
burned
through
the
roof
here
burned
and
there
as
if
god
messenger
through
the
close
wood
screen
plunged
and
replunged
his
weapon
at
a
venture
feeling
for
guilty
thee
and
me
then
broke
the
thunder
like
a
whole
sea
overhead
slower
ottima
do
not
lean
on
me
sebald
as
we
lay
who
said
let
death
come
now
is
right
to
die
right
to
be
punished
naught
completes
such
bliss
but
woe
who
said
that
how
did
we
ever
rise
that
we
slept
why
did
it
end
i
felt
you
taper
into
a
point
the
ruffled
ends
of
my
loose
locks
both
your
humid
lips
my
hair
is
fallen
now
knot
it
again
i
kiss
you
now
dear
ottima
now
and
now
this
way
will
you
forgive
me
be
once
more
my
great
queen
bind
it
thrice
about
my
brow
crown
me
your
queen
your
spirit
arbitress
magnificent
in
sin
say
that
i
crown
you
my
great
white
queen
my
spirit
arbitress
magnificent
without
is
heard
the
voice
pippa
year
at
the
day
at
the
morn
at
seven
hillside
lark
on
the
wing
snail
on
the
thorn
in
his
heaven
right
with
the
world
pippa
god
in
his
heaven
do
you
hear
that
who
spoke
you
you
spoke
oh
that
little
ragged
girl
she
must
have
rested
on
the
step
we
give
them
but
this
one
holiday
the
whole
year
round
did
you
ever
see
our
their
inside
there
are
ten
now
belong
to
you
she
stoops
to
pick
my
double
heartsease
sh
she
does
not
hear
call
you
out
louder
leave
me
go
get
your
clothes
on
dress
those
shoulders
sebald
wipe
off
that
paint
i
hate
you
miserable
my
god
and
she
is
emptied
of
it
now
outright
now
how
miraculously
gone
all
of
the
grace
had
she
not
strange
grace
once
why
the
blank
cheek
hangs
listless
as
it
likes
no
purpose
holds
the
features
up
together
only
the
cloven
brow
and
puckered
chin
stay
in
their
places
and
the
very
hair
that
seemed
to
have
a
sort
of
life
in
it
drops
a
dead
web
speak
to
me
not
of
me
that
round
great
face
where
not
an
angle
broke
the
delicious
indolence
all
broken
to
me
not
of
me
ungrateful
perjured
cheat
a
coward
too
but
ingrate
worse
than
all
beggar
my
slave
a
fawning
cringing
lie
leave
me
betray
me
i
can
see
your
drift
a
lie
that
walks
and
eats
and
drinks
my
god
those
morbid
olive
faultless
i
should
have
known
there
was
no
blood
beneath
you
hate
me
then
you
hate
me
then
to
think
she
would
succeed
in
her
absurd
attempt
and
fascinate
by
sinning
show
herself
superior
guilt
from
its
excess
superior
to
innocence
that
little
peasant
voice
has
righted
all
again
though
i
be
lost
i
know
which
is
the
better
never
fear
of
vice
or
virtue
purity
or
lust
nature
or
trick
i
see
what
i
have
done
entirely
now
oh
i
am
proud
to
feel
such
torments
let
the
world
take
credit
thence
i
having
done
my
deed
pay
too
its
price
i
hate
hate
curse
you
god
in
his
heaven
me
me
no
no
sebald
not
yourself
kill
me
mine
is
the
whole
crime
do
but
kill
me
then
yourself
then
presently
first
hear
me
speak
i
always
meant
to
kill
myself
wait
you
lean
on
my
breast
not
as
a
breast
do
love
me
the
more
because
you
lean
on
me
my
own
heart
sebald
there
there
both
deaths
presently
my
brain
is
drowned
now
quite
drowned
all
i
feel
is
is
at
intervals
a
within
me
as
of
waters
loosened
to
smother
up
some
ghastly
pit
there
they
go
whirls
from
a
black
fiery
sea
not
me
to
him
o
god
be
merciful
by
the
way
pippa
passing
from
the
hillside
to
orcana
foreign
students
of
painting
and
sculpture
from
venice
assembled
opposite
the
house
jules
young
french
statuary
at
attention
my
own
post
is
beneath
this
window
but
the
pomegranate
clump
yonder
will
hide
three
or
four
of
you
with
a
little
squeezing
and
schramm
and
his
pipe
must
lie
flat
in
the
balcony
four
five
who
a
defaulter
we
want
everybody
for
jules
must
not
be
suffered
to
hurt
his
bride
when
the
jest
found
out
all
here
only
our
poet
away
never
having
much
meant
to
be
present
moonstrike
him
the
airs
of
that
fellow
that
giovacchino
he
was
in
violent
love
with
himself
and
had
a
fair
prospect
of
thriving
in
his
suit
so
unmolested
was
it
when
suddenly
a
woman
falls
in
love
with
him
too
and
out
of
pure
jealousy
he
takes
himself
off
to
trieste
immortal
poem
and
all
whereto
is
this
prophetical
epitaph
appended
already
as
bluphocks
assures
me
a
lies
fouled
to
death
by
his
own
fault
the
simpleton
instead
of
cramp
couplets
each
like
a
knife
in
your
entrails
he
should
write
says
bluphocks
both
classically
and
an
epic
catalogue
of
the

subside
my
fine
fellow
if
the
marriage
was
over
by
ten
jules
will
certainly
be
here
in
a
minute
with
his
bride
good
only
so
should
the
poet
muse
have
been
universally
acceptable
says
bluphocks
canibus
and
delia
not
better
known
to
our
literary
dogs
than
the
boy
giovacchino
to
the
point
now
where
gottlieb
the
oh
listen
gottlieb
to
what
has
called
down
this
piece
of
friendly
vengeance
on
jules
of
which
we
now
assemble
to
witness
the
we
are
all
agreed
all
in
a
tale
observe
when
jules
shall
burst
out
on
us
in
a
fury
by
and
by
i
am
spokesman
the
verses
that
are
to
undeceive
jules
bear
my
name
of
lutwyche
but
each
professes
himself
alike
insulted
by
this
strutting
who
came
alone
from
paris
to
munich
and
thence
with
a
crowd
of
us
to
venice
and
possagno
here
but
proceeds
in
a
day
or
two
alone
again
oh
alone
indubitably
to
rome
and
florence
he
forsooth
take
up
his
portion
with
these
dissolute
brutalized
heartless
bunglers
so
he
was
heard
to
call
us
all
now
is
schramm
brutalized
i
should
like
to
know
am
i
heartless
why
somewhat
heartless
for
suppose
jules
a
coxcomb
as
much
as
you
choose
still
for
this
mere
coxcombry
you
will
have
brushed
off
what
do
folks
style
it
the
bloom
of
his
life
is
it
too
late
to
alter
these
now
you
call
his
i
ca
laugh
at
them
because
you
never
read
the
sham
letters
of
our
inditing
which
drew
forth
these
his
discovery
of
the
truth
will
be
frightful
that
the
joke
but
you
should
have
joined
us
at
the
beginning
there
no
doubt
he
loves
the
girl
loves
a
model
he
might
hire
by
the
hour
see
here
he
has
been
accustomed
he
writes
to
have
canova
women
about
him
in
stone
and
the
world
women
beside
him
in
flesh
these
being
as
much
below
as
those
above
his
soul
aspiration
but
now
he
is
to
have
the
reality
there
you
laugh
again
i
say
you
wipe
off
the
very
dew
of
his
youth
schramm
take
the
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
somebody
will
jules
lose
the
bloom
of
his
youth
nothing
worth
keeping
is
ever
lost
in
this
world
look
at
a
blossom
it
drops
presently
having
done
its
service
and
lasted
its
time
but
fruits
succeed
and
where
would
be
the
blossom
place
could
it
continue
as
well
affirm
that
your
eye
is
no
longer
in
your
body
because
its
earliest
favorite
whatever
it
may
have
first
loved
to
look
on
is
dead
and
done
with
as
that
any
affection
is
lost
to
the
soul
when
its
first
object
whatever
happened
first
to
satisfy
it
is
superseded
in
due
course
keep
but
ever
looking
whether
with
the
body
eye
or
the
mind
and
you
will
soon
find
something
to
look
on
has
a
man
done
wondering
at
women
there
follow
men
dead
and
alive
to
wonder
at
has
he
done
wondering
at
men
there
god
to
wonder
at
and
the
faculty
of
wonder
may
be
at
the
same
time
old
and
tired
enough
with
respect
to
its
first
object
and
yet
young
and
fresh
sufficiently
so
far
as
concerns
its
novel
one
thus
put
schramm
pipe
into
his
mouth
again
there
you
see
well
this
jules
a
wretched
fribble
oh
i
watched
his
disportings
at
possagno
the
other
day
canova
gallery
you
know
there
he
marches
first
resolvedly
past
great
works
by
the
dozen
without
vouchsafing
an
eye
all
at
once
he
stops
full
at
the
can
not
pass
that
old
acquaintance
without
a
nod
of
encouragement
in
your
new
place
beauty
then
behave
yourself
as
well
here
as
at
munich
i
see
you
next
he
posts
himself
deliberately
before
the
unfinished
for
half
an
hour
without
moving
till
up
he
starts
of
a
sudden
and
thrusts
his
very
nose
into
i
say
into
the
group
by
which
gesture
you
are
informed
that
precisely
the
sole
point
he
had
not
fully
mastered
in
canova
practice
was
a
certain
method
of
using
the
drill
in
the
articulation
of
the
and
that
likewise
has
he
mastered
at
length
therefore
to
poor
canova
whose
gallery
no
longer
needs
detain
his
successor
jules
the
predestinated
novel
thinker
in
marble
tell
him
about
the
women
go
on
to
the
women
why
on
that
matter
he
could
never
be
supercilious
enough
how
should
we
be
other
he
said
than
the
poor
devils
you
see
with
those
debasing
habits
we
cherish
he
was
not
to
wallow
in
that
mire
at
least
he
would
wait
and
love
only
at
the
proper
time
and
meanwhile
put
up
with
the
now
i
happened
to
hear
of
a
young
greek
real
greek
girl
at
malamocco
a
true
islander
do
you
see
with
hair
like
schramm
knows
white
and
quiet
as
an
apparition
and
fourteen
years
old
at
farthest
a
daughter
of
natalia
so
she
swears
that
hag
natalia
who
helps
us
to
models
at
three
an
hour
we
selected
this
girl
for
the
heroine
of
our
jest
so
first
jules
received
a
scented
letter
somebody
had
seen
his
tydeus
at
the
academy
and
my
picture
was
nothing
to
it
a
profound
admirer
bade
him
persevere
would
make
herself
known
to
him
ere
long
paolina
my
little
friend
of
the
transcribes
divinely
and
in
due
time
the
mysterious
correspondent
gave
certain
hints
of
her
peculiar
charms
the
pale
cheeks
the
black
hair
whatever
in
short
had
struck
us
in
our
malamocco
model
we
retained
her
name
too
phene
which
is
by
interpretation
now
think
of
jules
finding
himself
distinguished
from
the
herd
of
us
by
such
a
creature
in
his
very
first
answer
he
proposed
marrying
his
monitress
and
fancy
us
over
these
letters
two
three
times
a
day
to
receive
and
dispatch
i
concocted
the
main
of
it
relations
were
in
the
way
secrecy
must
be
observed
in
fine
would
he
wed
her
on
trust
and
only
speak
to
her
when
they
were
indissolubly
united
st
st
here
they
come
both
of
them
heaven
love
speak
softly
speak
within
yourselves
look
at
the
bridegroom
half
his
hair
in
storm
and
half
in
calm
patted
down
over
the
left
temple
like
a
frothy
cup
one
blows
on
to
cool
it
and
the
same
old
blouse
that
he
murders
the
marble
in
not
a
rich
vest
like
yours
hannibal
scratchy
rich
that
your
face
may
the
better
set
it
off
and
the
bride
yes
sure
enough
our
phene
should
you
have
known
her
in
her
clothes
how
magnificently
pale
she
does
not
also
take
it
for
earnest
i
hope
oh
natalia
concern
that
is
we
settle
with
natalia
she
does
not
speak
has
evidently
let
out
no
word
the
only
thing
is
will
she
equally
remember
the
rest
of
her
lesson
and
repeat
correctly
all
those
verses
which
are
to
break
the
secret
to
jules
how
he
gazes
on
her
pity
pity
they
go
in
now
silence
you
three
not
nearer
the
window
mind
than
that
pomegranate
just
where
the
little
girl
who
a
few
minutes
ago
passed
us
singing
is
seated
noon
scene
orcana
the
house
jules
crosses
its
threshold
phene
is
silent
on
jules
do
not
die
phene
i
am
yours
now
you
are
mine
now
let
fate
reach
me
how
she
likes
if
you
not
die
so
never
die
sit
here
my
workroom
single
seat
i
this
length
of
hair
and
lustrous
front
they
turn
like
an
entire
flower
upward
eyes
lips
last
your
chin
no
last
your
throat
turns
is
their
scent
pulls
down
my
face
upon
you
nay
look
ever
this
one
way
till
i
change
grow
you
i
could
change
into
you
beloved
you
by
me
and
i
by
you
this
is
your
hand
in
mine
and
side
by
side
we
sit
all
true
thank
god
i
have
spoken
speak
you
o
my
life
to
come
my
tydeus
must
be
carved
that
there
in
clay
yet
how
be
carved
with
you
about
the
room
where
must
i
place
you
when
i
think
that
once
this
roomfull
of
rough
seemed
my
heaven
without
you
shall
i
ever
work
again
get
fairly
into
my
old
ways
again
bid
each
conception
stand
while
trait
by
trait
my
hand
transfers
its
lineaments
to
stone
will
my
mere
fancies
live
near
you
their
truth
the
live
truth
passing
and
repassing
me
sitting
beside
me
now
speak
only
first
see
all
your
letters
not
well
contrived
their
is
psyche
robe
she
keeps
your
letters
next
her
skin
which
drops
out
foremost
ah
this
that
swam
down
like
a
first
moonbeam
into
my
world
again
those
eyes
complete
their
melancholy
survey
sweet
and
slow
of
beauty
to
the
human
archetype
on
me
with
pity
yet
some
wonder
too
as
if
god
bade
some
spirit
plague
a
world
and
this
were
the
one
moment
of
surprise
and
sorrow
while
she
took
her
station
pausing
what
she
sees
finds
good
and
must
destroy
what
gaze
you
at
those
books
i
told
you
of
let
your
first
word
to
me
rejoice
them
too
this
minion
a
coluthus
writ
in
red
bister
and
azure
by
bessarion
scribe
read
this
line
no
shame
homer
be
the
greek
first
breathed
me
from
the
lips
of
my
greek
girl
this
odyssey
in
coarse
black
vivid
type
with
faded
yellow
blossoms
page
and
page
to
mark
great
places
with
due
gratitude
he
said
and
on
antinous
bitter
shaft
a
flower
blots
out
the
rest
again
upon
your
search
my
statues
then
ah
do
not
mind
that
better
that
will
look
when
cast
in
bronze
an
almaign
kaiser
that
and
gold
with
truncheon
based
on
hip
this
rather
turn
to
what
unrecognized
i
thought
you
would
have
seen
that
here
you
sit
as
i
imagined
you
hippolyta
naked
upon
her
bright
numidian
horse
recall
you
this
then
carve
in
bold
relief
so
you
commanded

as

stand
up
all

i
have
labored
to
express
your
thought
quite
round
a
cluster
of
mere
hands
and
arms
thrust
in
all
senses
all

for
frame
to
a
sole
face
the
praiser
in
the
center
who
with
eyes
sightless
so
bend
they
back
to
light
inside
his
brain
where
visionary
forms
throng
up
sings
minding
not
that
palpitating
arch
of
hands
and
arms
nor
the
quick
drip
of
wine
from
the
drenched
leaves
nor
crowns
cast
off
violet
and
parsley
crowns
to
trample
on
sings
pausing
as
the
approve
devoutly
their
unconquerable
hymn
but
you
must
say
a
well
to
that
say
well
because
you
gaze
am
i
fantastic
sweet
gaze
like
my
very
marble
marbly
even
to
the
silence
why
before
i
found
the
real
flesh
phene
i
inured
myself
to
see
throughout
all
nature
varied
stuff
for
better
nature
birth
by
means
of
art
with
me
each
substance
tended
to
one
form
of
beauty
to
the
human
archetype
on
every
side
occurred
suggestive
germs
of
that
the
tree
the
flower
or
take
the
fruit
some
rosy
shape
continuing
the
peach
curved
beewise
its
bough
as
rosy
limbs
depending
nestled
in
the
leaves
and
just
from
a
cleft
the
whole
dryad
sprang
but
of
the
stuffs
one
can
be
master
of
how
i
divined
their
capabilities
from
the
smoothening
facile
chalk
that
yields
your
outline
to
the
air
embrace
by
a
halo
pearly
gloom
down
to
the
crisp
imperious
steel
so
sure
to
cut
its
one
confided
thought
clean
out
of
all
the
world
but
marble
my
tools
more
pliable
than
jelly
as
it
were
some
clear
primordial
creature
dug
from
depths
in
the
earth
heart
where
itself
breeds
itself
and
whence
all
baser
substance
may
be
worked
refine
it
off
to
air
you
may
condense
it
down
to
the
diamond
is
not
metal
there
when
the
sudden
speck
my
chisel
trips
not
flesh
as
flake
off
flake
i
scale
approach
lay
bare
those
bluish
veins
of
blood
asleep
lurks
flame
in
no
strange
windings
where
surprised
by
the
swift
implement
sent
home
at
once
flushes
and
glowings
radiate
and
hover
about
its
track
phene
what
why
is
this
that
whitening
cheek
those
still
dilating
eyes
ah
you
will
die
i
knew
that
you
would
die
phene
on
his
having
long
remained
now
the
end
coming
to
be
sure
it
must
have
ended
sometime
tush
why
need
i
speak
their
foolish
speech
i
can
not
bring
to
mind
one
half
of
it
beside
and
do
not
care
for
old
natalia
now
nor
any
of
them
oh
you
what
are
you
if
i
do
not
try
to
say
the
words
natalia
made
me
learn
to
please
your
friends
it
is
to
keep
myself
where
your
voice
lifted
me
by
letting
that
proceed
but
can
it
even
you
perhaps
can
not
take
up
now
you
have
once
let
fall
the
music
life
and
me
along
with
that
no
or
you
would
we
stay
then
as
we
are
above
the
world
you
creature
with
the
eyes
if
i
could
look
forever
up
to
them
as
now
you
let
me
i
believe
all
sin
all
memory
of
wrong
done
suffering
borne
would
drop
down
low
and
lower
to
the
earth
whence
all
that
low
comes
and
there
touch
and
stay
never
to
overtake
the
rest
of
me
all
that
unspotted
reaches
up
to
you
drawn
by
those
eyes
what
rises
is
myself
not
me
the
shame
and
suffering
but
they
sink
are
left
i
rise
above
them
keep
me
so
above
the
world
but
you
sink
for
your
eyes
are
altering
altered
stay
i
love
you
love
i
could
prevent
it
if
i
understood
more
of
your
words
to
me
was
in
the
tone
or
the
words
your
power
or
stay
i
will
repeat
their
speech
if
that
contents
you
only
change
no
more
and
i
shall
find
it
presently
far
back
here
in
the
brain
yourself
filled
up
natalia
threatened
me
that
harm
should
follow
unless
i
spoke
their
lesson
to
the
end
but
harm
to
me
i
thought
she
meant
not
you
your
friends
natalia
said
they
were
your
friends
and
meant
you
well
because
i
doubted
it
observing
what
was
very
strange
to
see
on
every
face
so
different
in
all
else
the
same
smile
girls
like
me
are
used
to
bear
but
never
men
men
can
not
stoop
so
low
yet
your
friends
speaking
of
you
used
that
smile
that
hateful
smirk
of
boundless
which
seems
to
take
possession
of
the
world
and
make
of
god
a
tame
confederate
purveyor
to
their
appetites
you
know
but
still
natalia
said
they
were
your
friends
and
they
assented
though
they
smiled
the
more
and
all
came
round
me
that
thin
englishman
with
light
lank
hair
seemed
leader
of
the
rest
he
held
a
paper
what
we
want
said
he
ending
some
explanation
to
his
friends
is
something
slow
involved
and
mystical
to
hold
jules
long
in
doubt
yet
take
his
taste
and
lure
him
on
until
at
innermost
where
he
seeks
sweetness
soul
he
may
find
this
as
in
the
apple
core
the
noisome
fly
for
insects
on
the
rind
are
seen
at
once
and
brushed
aside
as
soon
but
this
is
found
only
when
on
the
lips
or
loathing
tongue
and
so
he
read
what
i
have
got
by
heart
i
speak
it
do
not
die
love
i
am
yours
no
is
not
that
or
like
that
part
of
words
yourself
began
by
speaking
strange
to
lose
what
cost
such
pains
to
learn
is
this
more
right
am
a
painter
who
can
not
paint
my
life
a
devil
rather
than
saint
my
brain
as
poor
a
creature
too
end
to
all
i
can
not
do
do
one
thing
at
least
i
can
a
man
or
hate
a
thus
my
lore
the
valley
of
love
i
went
the
lovingest
spot
to
abide
just
on
the
verge
where
i
pitched
my
tent
found
hate
dwelling
let
the
bridegroom
ask
what
the
painter
meant
his
bride
of
the
peerless
bride
further
i
traversed
hate
grove
the
hatefullest
nook
to
dwell
lo
where
i
flung
myself
prone
couched
the
shadow
threefold
the
meaning
those
black
above
a
painter
lip
should
tell
and
here
said
he
jules
probably
will
ask
have
black
eyes
love
you
are
sure
enough
my
peerless
bride
then
do
you
tell
indeed
what
needs
some
explanation
what
means
this
and
i
am
to
go
on
without
a
word
i
grew
wise
in
love
and
hate
simple
that
i
was
of
when
i
loved
i
would
eyelids
hands
feet
form
and
her
i
loved
in
one
embrace
if
by
mere
love
i
could
love
immensely
when
i
hated
i
would
sword
and
wipe
with
the
first
foe
whole
life
out
like
a
sponge
if
by
mere
hate
i
could
hate
intensely
now
i
am
wiser
know
better
the
passion
seeks
aid
from
its
opposite
passion
if
i
see
cause
to
love
more
hate
ever
man
loved
ever
hated
before
seek
in
the
valley
of
love
nest
or
the
nook
in
hate
grove
my
soul
may
surely
essence
naught
less
of
each
hate
of
all
hates
the
all
loves
in
the
valley
or
grove
find
them
the
very
of
the
other
i
love
most
love
is
hate
and
when
hate
is
love
then
i
hate
most
love
smiles
through
hate
iron
casque
grins
through
love
mask
how
having
hated
thee
sought
long
and
reach
thy
heart
nor
skin
but
pierce
to
the
quick
this
my
jules
and
be
answered
thy
bride
how
the
painter
lutwyche
can
hate
jules
lutwyche
who
else
but
all
of
them
no
doubt
hated
me
they
at
venice
presently
their
turn
however
you
i
shall
not
meet
if
i
dreamed
saying
this
would
wake
me
keep
what
here
the
gold
we
can
not
meet
again
consider
and
the
money
was
but
meant
for
two
years
travel
which
is
over
now
all
chance
or
hope
or
care
or
need
of
it
this
and
what
comes
from
selling
these
my
casts
and
books
and
medals
except
let
them
go
together
so
the
produce
keeps
you
safe
out
of
natalia
clutches
if
by
chance
for
all
chance
here
i
should
survive
the
gang
at
venice
root
out
all
fifteen
of
them
we
might
meet
somewhere
since
the
world
is
wide
without
is
heard
the
voice
pippa
her
but
a
least
excuse
to
love
me
where
can
this
arm
establish
her
above
me
fortune
fixed
her
as
my
lady
there
already
to
eternally
reprove
me
hist
said
kate
the
queen
oh
cried
the
maiden
binding
her
tresses
is
only
a
page
that
carols
unseen
your
hounds
their
messes
she
wronged
to
the
rescue
of
her
honor
heart
she
poor
what
costs
it
to
be
styled
a
donor
an
earth
to
cleave
a
sea
to
that
fortune
should
have
thrust
all
this
upon
her
nay
list
bade
kate
the
queen
still
cried
the
maiden
binding
her
tresses
is
only
a
page
that
carols
your
hawks
their
jesses
pippa
jules
what
name
was
that
the
little
girl
sang
forth
kate
the
cornaro
doubtless
who
renounced
the
crown
of
cyprus
to
be
lady
here
at
asolo
where
still
her
memory
stays
and
peasants
sing
how
once
a
certain
page
pined
for
the
grace
of
her
so
far
above
his
power
of
doing
good
to
kate
the
queen
she
never
could
be
wronged
be
poor
he
sighed
need
him
to
help
her
yes
a
bitter
thing
to
see
our
lady
above
all
need
of
us
yet
so
we
look
ere
we
will
love
not
i
but
the
world
looks
so
if
whoever
loves
must
be
in
some
sort
god
or
worshiper
the
blessing
or
the
queen
or
page
why
should
we
always
choose
the
page
part
here
is
a
woman
with
utter
need
of
me
i
find
myself
queen
here
it
seems
how
strange
look
at
the
woman
here
with
the
new
soul
like
my
own
psyche
fresh
upon
her
lips
alit
the
visionary
butterfly
waiting
my
word
to
enter
and
make
bright
or
flutter
off
and
leave
all
blank
as
first
this
body
had
no
soul
before
but
slept
or
stirred
was
beauteous
or
ungainly
free
from
taint
or
foul
with
stain
as
outward
things
fastened
their
image
on
its
passiveness
now
it
will
wake
feel
live
or
die
again
shall
to
produce
form
out
of
unshaped
stuff
be
art
and
further
to
evoke
a
soul
from
form
be
nothing
this
new
soul
is
mine
now
to
kill
lutwyche
what
would
that
do
save
a
wretched
dauber
men
will
hoot
to
death
without
me
from
their
hooting
oh
to
hear
god
voice
plain
as
i
heard
it
first
before
they
broke
in
with
their
laughter
i
heard
them
henceforth
not
god
to
ancona
greece
some
isle
i
wanted
silence
only
there
is
clay
everywhere
one
may
do
one
likes
in
art
the
only
thing
is
to
make
sure
that
one
does
like
it
which
takes
pains
to
know
scatter
all
this
my
phene
this
mad
dream
who
what
is
lutwyche
what
natalia
friends
what
the
whole
world
except
our
love
my
own
own
phene
but
i
told
you
did
i
not
ere
night
we
travel
for
your
land
some
isle
with
the
sea
silence
on
it
stand
aside
i
do
but
break
these
paltry
models
up
to
begin
art
afresh
meet
lutwyche
i
and
save
him
from
my
statue
meeting
him
some
unsuspected
isle
in
the
far
seas
like
a
god
going
through
his
world
there
stands
one
mountain
for
a
moment
in
the
dusk
whole
brotherhoods
of
cedars
on
its
brow
and
you
are
ever
by
me
while
i
gaze
are
in
my
arms
as
now
as
now
as
now
some
unsuspected
isle
in
the
far
seas
some
unsuspected
isle
in
seas
by
the
way
pippa
passing
from
orcana
to
the
turret
two
or
three
of
the
austrian
police
loitering
bluphocks
english
vagabond
just
in
view
of
the
so
that
is
your
pippa
the
little
girl
who
passed
us
singing
well
your
bishop
money
shall
be
honestly
earned
now
do
make
me
that
sour
face
because
i
bring
the
bishop
name
into
the
business
we
know
he
can
have
nothing
to
do
with
such
horrors
we
know
that
he
is
a
saint
and
all
that
a
bishop
should
be
who
is
a
great
man
beside
were
but
every
worm
a
maggot
every
fly
a
grig
every
bough
a
christmas
faggot
every
tune
a
jig
in
fact
i
have
abjured
all
religions
but
the
last
i
inclined
to
was
the
armenian
for
i
have
traveled
do
you
see
and
at
koenigsberg
prussia
improper
so
styled
because
there
a
sort
of
bleak
hungry
sun
there
you
might
remark
over
a
venerable
a
certain
chaldee
inscription
and
brief
as
it
is
a
mere
glance
at
it
used
absolutely
to
change
the
mood
of
every
bearded
passenger
in
they
turned
one
and
all
the
young
and
lightsome
with
no
irreverent
pause
the
aged
and
decrepit
with
a
sensible
alacrity
was
the
grand
rabbi
abode
in
short
struck
with
curiosity
i
lost
no
time
in
learning
syriac
these
are
vowels
you
dogs
follow
my
stick
end
in
the
mud
darii
ferio
and
one
morning
presented
myself
in
hand
a
b
c
i
picked
it
out
letter
by
letter
and
what
was
the
purport
of
this
miraculous
posy
some
cherished
legend
of
the
past
you
say
moses
land
with
fly
and
or
to
jonah
sounded
harshish
get
thee
up
and
go
to
or
the
angel
meeting
balaam
straight
his
ass
returned
a
in
no
wise
boach
somebody
or
other
isaach
of
stolen
goods
so
talk
to
me
of
the
religion
of
a
bishop
i
have
renounced
all
bishops
save
bishop
beveridge
mean
to
live
so
and
die
some
greek
dead
and
merry
hellward
bound
in
charon
wherry
with
food
for
both
worlds
under
and
hecate
supper
and
never
an
though
thanks
to
you
or
this
intendant
through
you
or
this
bishop
through
his
intendant
i
possess
a
burning
pocketful
of
pay
stygian
ferry
there
is
the
girl
then
go
and
deserve
them
the
moment
you
have
pointed
out
to
us
signor
luigi
and
his
mother
the
i
have
been
noticing
a
house
yonder
this
long
while
not
a
shutter
unclosed
since
morning
old
luca
gaddi
that
owns
the
here
he
dozes
by
the
hour
wakes
up
sighs
deeply
says
he
should
like
to
be
prince
metternich
and
then
dozes
again
after
having
bidden
young
sebald
the
foreigner
set
his
wife
to
playing
draughts
never
molest
such
a
household
they
mean
well
only
can
not
you
tell
me
something
of
this
little
pippa
i
must
have
to
do
with
one
could
make
something
of
that
name
pippa
that
is
short
for
felippa
rhyming
to
consults
hertrippa
believest
thou
king
agrippa
something
might
be
done
with
that
name
put
into
rhyme
that
your
head
and
a
ripe
muskmelon
would
not
be
dear
at
half
a
leave
this
fooling
and
look
out
the
afternoon
over
or
nearly
so
where
in
this
passport
of
signor
luigi
does
our
principal
instruct
you
to
watch
him
so
narrowly
there
what
there
beside
a
simple
signature
that
english
fool
busy
watching
flourish
all
round
put
all
possible
obstacles
in
his
way
oblong
dot
at
the
end
detain
him
till
further
advices
reach
you
scratch
at
bottom
send
him
back
on
pretense
of
some
informality
in
the
above
on
side
which
is
the
case
here
arrest
him
at
once
why
and
wherefore
i
do
concern
myself
but
my
instructions
amount
to
this
if
signor
luigi
leaves
home
tonight
for
vienna
well
and
good
the
passport
deposed
with
us
for
our
visa
is
really
for
his
own
use
they
have
misinformed
the
office
and
he
means
well
but
let
him
stay
over
tonight
there
has
been
the
pretense
we
suspect
the
accounts
of
his
corresponding
and
holding
intelligence
with
the
carbonari
are
correct
we
arrest
him
at
once
tomorrow
comes
venice
and
presently
spielberg
bluphocks
makes
the
signal
sure
enough
that
is
he
entering
the
turret
with
his
mother
no
doubt
evening
the
turret
on
the
hill
above
luigi
mother
if
there
blew
wind
you
hear
a
long
sigh
easing
the
utmost
heaviness
of
music
heart
here
in
the
archway
oh
no
no
in
farther
where
the
echo
is
made
on
the
ridge
here
surely
then
how
plain
the
tap
of
my
heel
as
i
leaped
up
hark
lucius
junius
the
very
ghost
of
a
voice
whose
body
is
caught
and
kept
by
what
are
those
mere
withered
wall
flowers
waving
overhead
they
seem
an
elvish
group
with
thin
bleached
hair
that
lean
out
of
their
topmost
fortress
look
and
listen
mountain
men
to
what
we
say
hand
under
chin
of
each
grave
earthy
face
up
and
show
faces
all
of
you
all
of
you
that
the
king
dwarf
with
the
scarlet
comb
old
franz
come
down
and
meet
your
fate
hark
meet
your
fate
let
him
not
meet
it
my
luigi
do
not
go
to
his
city
putting
crime
aside
half
of
these
ills
of
italy
are
feigned
your
pellicos
and
writers
for
effect
write
for
effect
hush
say
a
writes
and
b
these
a
and
b
write
for
effect
i
say
then
evil
is
in
its
nature
loud
while
good
is
silent
you
hear
each
petty
injury
none
of
his
virtues
he
is
old
beside
quiet
and
kind
and
densely
stupid
why
do
a
and
b
not
kill
him
themselves
they
teach
others
to
kill
him
me
and
if
i
fail
others
to
succeed
now
if
a
tried
and
failed
i
could
not
teach
that
mine
the
lesser
task
mother
they
visit
night
by
night
you
luigi
ah
will
you
let
me
tell
you
what
you
are
why
not
oh
the
one
thing
you
fear
to
hint
you
may
assure
yourself
i
say
and
say
ever
to
myself
at
times
nay
even
as
now
we
sit
i
think
my
mind
is
touched
suspect
all
is
not
sound
but
is
not
knowing
that
what
constitutes
one
sane
or
otherwise
i
know
i
am
thus
so
all
is
right
again
i
laugh
at
myself
as
through
the
town
i
walk
and
see
men
merry
as
if
no
italy
were
suffering
then
i
ponder
i
am
rich
young
healthy
why
should
this
fact
trouble
me
more
than
it
troubles
these
but
it
does
trouble
no
trouble
a
bad
word
for
as
i
walk
there
springing
and
melody
and
giddiness
and
old
quaint
turns
and
passages
of
my
youth
dreams
long
forgotten
little
in
themselves
return
to
me
whatever
may
amuse
me
and
earth
seems
in
a
truce
with
me
and
heaven
accords
with
me
all
things
suspend
their
strife
the
very
cicala
laughs
there
goes
he
and
there
feast
him
the
time
is
short
he
is
on
his
way
for
the
world
sake
feast
him
this
once
our
friend
and
in
return
for
all
this
i
can
trip
cheerfully
up
the
i
go
this
evening
mother
but
mistrust
yourself
mistrust
the
judgment
you
pronounce
on
him
oh
there
i
feel
am
sure
that
i
am
right
mistrust
your
judgment
then
of
the
mere
means
to
this
wild
enterprise
say
you
are
right
how
should
one
in
your
state
bring
to
pass
what
would
require
a
cool
head
a
cold
heart
and
a
calm
hand
you
never
will
escape
escape
to
even
wish
that
would
spoil
all
the
dying
is
best
part
of
it
too
much
have
i
enjoyed
these
fifteen
years
of
mine
to
leave
myself
excuse
for
longer
life
was
not
life
pressed
down
running
with
joy
that
i
might
finish
with
it
ere
my
fellows
who
sparelier
feasted
make
a
longer
stay
i
was
put
at
the
helped
to
all
at
first
i
rise
up
happy
and
content
god
must
be
glad
one
loves
his
world
so
much
i
can
give
news
of
earth
to
all
the
dead
who
ask
me
last
year
sunsets
and
great
stars
which
had
a
right
to
come
first
and
see
ebb
the
crimson
wave
that
drifts
the
sun
away
those
crescent
moons
with
notched
and
burning
rims
that
strengthened
into
sharp
fire
and
there
stood
impatient
of
the
azure
and
that
day
in
march
a
double
rainbow
stopped
the
storm
may
warm
slow
yellow
moonlit
summer
nights
gone
are
they
but
i
have
them
in
my
soul
he
will
not
go
you
smile
at
me
is
true
voluptuousness
grotesqueness
ghastliness
environ
my
devotedness
as
quaintly
as
round
about
some
antique
altar
wreathe
the
rose
festoons
goats
horns
and
oxen
skulls
see
now
you
reach
the
city
you
must
cross
his
threshold
how
oh
that
if
we
conspired
then
would
come
pains
in
plenty
as
you
guess
but
guess
not
how
the
qualities
most
fit
for
such
an
office
qualities
i
have
would
little
stead
me
otherwise
employed
yet
prove
of
rarest
merit
only
here
everyone
knows
for
what
his
excellence
will
serve
but
no
one
ever
will
consider
for
what
his
worst
defect
might
serve
and
yet
have
you
not
seen
me
range
our
coppice
yonder
in
search
of
a
distorted
ash
i
find
the
wry
spoilt
branch
a
natural
perfect
bow
fancy
the
man
arriving
at
the
palace
on
my
errand
no
no
i
have
a
handsome
dress
packed
up
white
satin
here
to
set
off
my
black
hair
in
i
shall
march
for
you
may
watch
your
life
out
behind
thick
walls
make
friends
there
to
betray
you
more
than
one
man
spoils
everything
march
straight
only
no
clumsy
knife
to
fumble
for
take
the
great
gate
and
walk
not
saunter
on
through
guards
and
guards
i
have
rehearsed
it
all
inside
the
turret
here
a
hundred
times
do
ask
the
way
of
whom
you
meet
observe
but
where
they
cluster
thickliest
is
the
door
of
doors
they
let
you
pass
they
never
blab
each
to
the
other
he
knows
not
the
favorite
whence
he
is
bound
and
what
his
business
now
walk
in
straight
up
to
him
you
have
no
knife
be
prompt
how
should
he
scream
then
out
with
you
italy
italy
my
italy
you
free
you
free
oh
mother
i
could
dream
they
got
about
me
andrea
from
his
exile
pier
from
his
dungeon
gualtier
from
his
grave
well
you
shall
go
yet
seems
this
patriotism
the
easiest
virtue
for
a
selfish
man
to
acquire
he
loves
himself
and
next
the
world
if
he
must
love
beyond
but
naught
between
as
a
man
sees
naught
midway
his
body
and
the
sun
above
but
you
are
my
adored
luigi
ever
obedient
to
my
least
wish
and
running
with
love
i
could
not
call
you
cruel
or
unkind
once
more
your
ground
for
killing
him
then
go
now
do
you
try
me
or
make
sport
of
me
how
first
the
austrians
got
these
provinces
if
that
is
all
i
satisfy
you
soon
never
by
conquest
but
by
cunning
for
that
treaty
whereby
well
sure
he
arrived
the
telltale
cuckoo
spring
his
confidant
and
he
lets
out
her
april
purposes
or
better
go
at
once
to
modern
time
he
has
they
have
in
fact
i
understand
but
ca
restate
the
matter
that
my
boast
others
could
reason
it
out
to
you
and
prove
things
they
have
made
me
feel
why
go
tonight
morn
for
adventure
jupiter
is
now

can
not
hear
you

his
revel
through
our
leafy
world
yes
chiara

be
here
in
june
remember
yourself
appointed
that
month
for
her
coming
was
that
low
noise
the
echo
the
she
must
be
grown
with
her
blue
eyes
upturned
as
if
life
were
one
long
and
sweet
surprise
in
june
she
comes
we
were
to
see
together
the
titian
at
treviso
there
again
without
is
heard
the
voice
pippa
king
lived
long
ago
the
morning
of
the
world
earth
was
nigher
heaven
than
the
king
locks
curled
a
forehead
the
space
horn
and
some
sacrificial
bull
calm
as
a
babe
he
was
got
to
a
sleepy
mood
safe
from
all
decrepitude
with
its
bane
so
sure
gone
by
the
gods
so
loved
him
while
he
dreamed
having
lived
thus
long
there
need
the
king
should
ever
no
need
that
sort
of
king
should
ever
die
the
rocks
his
city
was
his
palace
in
the
sun
sat
to
see
his
people
pass
judge
them
every
its
threshold
of
smooth
haled
him
many
a
in
the
and
shameless
or
rough
pirate
the
left
aground
sometimes
clung
about
his
feet
bleeding
lid
and
burning
cheek
woman
bitterest
wrong
to
one
with
sullen
thickset
brows
sometimes
from
the
angry
priests
a
pale
wretch
brought
through
some
chink
had
pushed
and
knees
and
elbows
belly
and
breast
into
the
temple
was
by
the
very
god
in
the
darkness
and
forward
keeping
his
brazen
bowls
such
rogues
to
catch
all
and
everyone
king
judged
sitting
in
the
that
king
should
still
judge
sitting
in
the
sun
councilors
on
left
and
right
anxious
up
but
no
the
king
old
smiling
eyes
the
very
blue
had
turned
to
said
a
python
scared
one
breathless
city
till
he
came
forky
tongue
and
eyes
on
flame
the
old
king
sat
to
judge
alway
when
he
saw
the
sweepy
with
a
crown
of
berries
the
god
will
hardly
give
to
the
maiden
who
singeth
dancing
the
by
the
lights
his
wondrous
forest
rites
this
he
did
not
that
threshold
in
the
sun
the
old
king
smiling
grace
had
kings
when
the
world
begun
pippa
and
such
grace
have
they
now
that
the
world
ends
the
python
at
the
city
on
the
throne
and
brave
men
god
would
crown
for
slaying
him
lurk
in
lest
they
fall
his
prey
are
crowns
yet
to
be
won
in
this
late
time
which
weakness
makes
me
hesitate
to
reach
tis
god
voice
calls
how
could
i
stay
farewell
by
the
way
pippa
passing
from
the
turret
to
the
bishop
brother
house
close
to
the
duomo
maria
girls
on
the
there
goes
a
swallow
to
venice
the
stout
seafarer
seeing
those
birds
fly
makes
one
wish
for
wings
let
us
all
wish
you
wish
first
i
this
sunset
to
finish
that
old
somebody
i
know
grayer
and
older
than
my
grandfather
to
give
me
the
same
treat
he
gave
last
week
feeding
me
on
his
knee
with
lampreys
and
red
and
mumbling
the
while
some
folly
about
how
well
i
fare
let
sit
and
eat
my
supper
quietly
since
had
he
not
himself
been
late
this
morning
detained
at
never
mind
where
had
he
not
eh
baggage
had
i
not
how
she
can
lie
look
there
by
the
nails
what
makes
your
fingers
red
dipping
them
into
wine
to
write
bad
words
with
on
the
bright
table
how
he
laughed
my
turn
spring
come
and
summer
coming
i
would
wear
a
long
loose
gown
down
to
the
feet
and
hands
with
plaits
here
close
about
the
throat
all
day
and
all
night
lie
the
cool
long
nights
in
bed
and
have
new
milk
to
drink
apples
to
eat
deuzans
and
junetings
ah
i
should
say
this
is
away
in
the
fields
miles
say
at
once
you
be
at
home
she
always
be
at
home
now
comes
the
story
of
the
farm
among
the
cherry
orchards
and
how
april
snowed
white
blossoms
on
her
as
she
ran
why
fool
they
rubbed
the
out
how
tall
you
were
twisted
your
starling
neck
broken
his
cage
made
a
dunghill
of
your
garden
they
destroy
my
garden
since
i
left
them
well
perhaps
i
would
have
done
so
so
i
hope
they
have
a
curled
out
of
our
cottage
wall
they
called
it
mine
i
have
forgotten
why
it
must
have
been
there
long
ere
i
was
born
i
think
i
hear
the
wasps
pricking
the
papers
strung
to
flutter
there
and
keep
off
birds
in
coarse
long
papers
and
the
wasps
eat
them
prick
them
through
and
through
how
her
mouth
twitches
where
was
i
before
she
broke
in
with
her
wishes
and
long
gowns
and
wasps
would
i
be
such
a
fool
oh
here
this
is
my
way
i
answer
everyone
who
asks
me
why
i
make
so
much
of
him
if
you
say
you
love
him
straight
he
not
be
gulled
he
that
seduced
me
when
i
was
a
girl
thus
high
had
eyes
like
yours
or
hair
like
yours
brown
red
white
as
the
case
may
be
that
pleases
see
how
that
beetle
burnishes
in
the
path
there
sparkles
he
along
the
dust
and
there
your
journey
to
that
spoiled
at
least
when
i
was
young
they
said
if
you
killed
one
of
those
sunshiny
beetles
that
his
friend
up
there
would
shine
no
more
that
day
nor
next
when
you
were
young
nor
are
you
young
that
true
how
your
plump
arms
that
were
have
dropped
away
why
i
can
span
them
cecco
beats
you
still
no
matter
so
you
keep
your
curious
hair
i
wish
they
find
a
way
to
dye
our
hair
your
color
any
lighter
tint
indeed
than
black
the
men
say
they
are
sick
of
black
black
eyes
black
hair
sick
of
yours
like
enough
do
you
pretend
you
ever
tasted
lampreys
and
ortolans
giovita
of
the
palace
engaged
but
there
no
trusting
him
to
slice
me
polenta
with
a
knife
that
had
cut
up
an
ortolan
why
there
is
not
that
pippa
we
are
to
talk
to
under
the
window
quick
where
the
lights
are
that
she
no
or
she
would
sing
for
the
intendant
said
oh
you
sing
first
then
if
she
listens
and
comes
close
i
tell
you
sing
that
song
the
young
english
noble
made
who
took
you
for
the
purest
of
the
pure
and
meant
to
leave
the
world
for
you
what
fun
love
me
yet
and
i
can
love
protracted
growing
reared
that
bunch
of
flowers
you
carry
seeds
of
april
plant
a
heartful
now
some
least
is
sure
to
yield
what
you
not
pluck
indeed
love
but
may
be
look
at
least
on
love
remains
grave
one
violet
look
that
pays
a
thousand
death
you
love
me
yet
pippa
oh
you
may
come
closer
we
shall
not
eat
you

very
person

great
rich

englishman

so
violently

unlike

am
a
sicilian

in
your
julys

full
summer
at
messina
as
we
priests
used
to
cross
in
procession
the
great
square
on
assumption
day
you
might
see
our
thickest
yellow
tapers
twist
suddenly
in
two
each
like
a
falling
star
or
sink
down
on
themselves
in
a
gore
of
wax

acquaintance

brother
affairs

tender
of
turning

far
back

far
back
aye
aye
ugh
ugh
nothing
but
disappointments
here
below
i
remark
a
considerable
payment
made
to
yourself
on
this
third
of
december
talk
of
disappointments
there
was
a
young
fellow
here
jules
a
foreign
sculptor
i
did
my
utmost
to
advance
that
the
church
might
be
a
gainer
by
us
both
he
was
going
on
hopefully
enough
and
of
a
sudden
he
notifies
to
me
some
marvelous
change
that
has
happened
in
his
notions
of
art
here
his
letter
he
never
had
a
clearly
conceived
ideal
within
his
brain
till
today
yet
since
his
hand
could
manage
a
chisel
he
has
practiced
expressing
other
men
ideals
and
in
the
very
perfection
he
has
attained
to
he
foresees
an
ultimate
failure
his
unconscious
hand
will
pursue
its
prescribed
course
of
old
years
and
will
reproduce
with
a
fatal
expertness
the
ancient
types
let
the
novel
one
appear
never
so
palpably
to
his
spirit
there
is
but
one
method
of
escape
confiding
the
virgin
type
to
as
chaste
a
hand
he
will
turn
painter
instead
of
sculptor
and
paint
not
carve
its
characteristics
strike
out
i
dare
say
a
school
like
correggio
how
think
you
ugo
is
correggio
a
painter
foolish
jules
and
yet
after
all
why
foolish
he
may
probably
will
fail
egregiously
but
if
there
should
arise
a
new
painter
will
it
not
be
in
some
such
way
by
a
poet
now
or
a
musician
spirits
who
have
conceived
and
perfected
an
ideal
through
some
other
channel
transferring
it
to
this
and
escaping
our
conventional
roads
by
pure
ignorance
of
them
eh
ugo
if
you
have
no
appetite
talk
at
least
ugo
sir
i
can
submit
no
longer
to
this
course
of
yours
first
you
select
the
group
of
which
i
formed
one
next
you
thin
it
gradually
always
retaining
me
with
your
smile
and
so
do
you
proceed
till
you
have
fairly
got
me
alone
with
you
between
four
stone
walls
and
now
then
let
this
farce
this
chatter
end
now
what
is
it
you
want
with
me
ugo
from
the
instant
you
arrived
i
felt
your
smile
on
me
as
you
questioned
me
about
this
and
the
other
article
in
those
papers
why
your
brother
should
have
given
me
this
villa
that
and
your
nod
at
the
end
meant
what
possibly
that
i
wished
for
no
loud
talk
here
if
once
you
set
me
coughing
ugo
i
have
your
brother
hand
and
seal
to
all
i
possess
now
ask
me
what
for
what
service
i
did
him
ask
me
i
would
better
not
i
should
rip
up
old
disgraces
let
out
my
poor
brother
weaknesses
by
the
way
maffeo
of
forli
which
i
forgot
to
observe
is
your
true
name
was
the
interdict
ever
taken
off
you
for
robbing
that
church
at
cesena
no
nor
needs
be
for
when
i
murdered
your
brother
friend
pasquale
for
him
ah
he
employed
you
in
that
business
did
he
well
i
must
let
you
keep
as
you
say
this
villa
and
that
for
fear
the
world
should
find
out
my
relations
were
of
so
indifferent
a
stamp
maffeo
my
family
is
the
oldest
in
messina
and
century
after
century
have
my
progenitors
gone
on
polluting
themselves
with
every
wickedness
under
heaven
my
own
father
rest
his
soul
i
have
i
know
a
chapel
to
support
that
it
may
rest
my
dear
two
dead
brothers
were
what
you
know
tolerably
well
i
the
youngest
might
have
rivaled
them
in
vice
if
not
in
wealth
but
from
my
boyhood
i
came
out
from
among
them
and
so
am
not
partaker
of
their
plagues
my
glory
springs
from
another
source
or
if
from
this
by
contrast
only
for
i
the
bishop
am
the
brother
of
your
employers
ugo
i
hope
to
repair
some
of
their
wrong
however
so
far
as
my
brother
treasure
reverts
to
me
i
can
stop
the
consequences
of
his
crime
and
not
one
shall
escape
me
maffeo
the
sword
we
quiet
men
spurn
away
you
shrewd
knaves
pick
up
and
commit
murders
with
what
opportunities
the
virtuous
forego
the
villainous
seize
because
to
pleasure
myself
apart
from
other
considerations
my
food
would
be
my
dress
sackcloth
and
my
couch
straw
am
i
therefore
to
let
you
the
offscouring
of
the
earth
seduce
the
poor
and
ignorant
by
appropriating
a
pomp
these
will
be
sure
to
think
lessens
the
abominations
so
unaccountably
and
exclusively
associated
with
it
must
i
let
villas
and
go
to
you
a
murderer
and
thief
that
you
may
beget
by
means
of
them
other
murderers
and
thieves
no
if
my
cough
would
but
allow
me
to
speak
what
am
i
to
expect
you
are
going
to
punish
me
must
punish
you
maffeo
i
can
not
afford
to
cast
away
a
chance
i
have
whole
centuries
of
sin
to
redeem
and
only
a
month
or
two
of
life
to
do
it
in
how
should
i
dare
to
say
forgive
us
our
trespasses
my
friend
it
is
because
i
avow
myself
a
very
worm
sinful
beyond
measure
that
i
reject
a
line
of
conduct
you
would
applaud
perhaps
shall
i
proceed
as
it
were
i
who
have
no
symptom
of
reason
to
assume
that
aught
less
than
my
strenuousest
efforts
will
keep
myself
out
of
mortal
sin
much
less
keep
others
out
no
i
do
trespass
but
will
not
double
that
by
allowing
you
to
trespass
and
suppose
the
villas
are
not
your
brother
to
give
nor
yours
to
take
oh
you
are
hasty
enough
just
now
no
aye
can
you
read
the
substance
of
a
letter
no
i
have
received
from
rome
it
is
precisely
on
the
ground
there
mentioned
of
the
suspicion
i
have
that
a
certain
child
of
my
late
elder
brother
who
would
have
succeeded
to
his
estates
was
murdered
in
infancy
by
you
maffeo
at
the
instigation
of
my
late
younger
brother
that
the
pontiff
enjoins
on
me
not
merely
the
bringing
that
maffeo
to
condign
punishment
but
the
taking
all
pains
as
guardian
of
the
infant
heritage
for
the
church
to
recover
it
parcel
by
parcel
howsoever
whensoever
and
wheresoever
while
you
are
now
gnawing
those
fingers
the
police
are
engaged
in
sealing
up
your
papers
maffeo
and
the
mere
raising
my
voice
brings
my
people
from
the
next
room
to
dispose
of
yourself
but
i
want
you
to
confess
quietly
and
save
me
raising
my
voice
why
man
do
i
not
know
the
old
story
the
heir
between
the
succeeding
heir
and
this
heir
ruffianly
instrument
and
their
complot
effect
and
the
life
of
fear
and
bribes
and
ominous
smiling
silence
did
you
throttle
or
stab
my
brother
infant
come
now
so
old
a
story
and
tell
it
no
better
when
did
such
an
instrument
ever
produce
such
an
effect
either
the
child
smiles
in
his
face
or
most
likely
he
is
not
fool
enough
to
put
himself
in
the
power
so
thoroughly
the
child
is
always
ready
to
produce
as
you
say
howsoever
wheresoever
and
whensoever
liar
strike
me
ah
so
might
a
father
chastise
i
shall
sleep
soundly
tonight
at
least
though
the
gallows
await
me
tomorrow
for
what
a
life
did
i
lead
carlo
of
cesena
reminds
me
of
his
connivance
every
time
i
pay
his
annuity
which
happens
commonly
thrice
a
year
if
i
remonstrate
he
will
confess
all
to
the
good
bishop
you
i
see
through
the
trick
caitiff
i
would
you
spoke
truth
for
once
all
shall
be
sifted
however
seven
times
sifted
and
how
my
absurd
riches
encumbered
me
i
dared
not
lay
claim
to
above
half
my
possessions
let
me
but
once
unbosom
myself
glorify
heaven
and

done
me
however
surely
no

sudden

above
us
bound
to
spoil
such
idle
chatter
as
ours
it
were
indeed
a
serious
matter
if
silly
talk
like
ours
should
put
to
shame
the
pious
man
the
man
devoid
of
blame
the
ah
but
ah
but
all
the
same
no
mere
mortal
has
a
right
to
carry
that
exalted
air
best
people
are
not
angels
quite
while
not
the
worst
of
people
doings
scare
the
devil
so
there
that
proud
look
to
spare
which
is
mere
counsel
to
myself
mind
for
i
have
just
been
the
holy
monsignor

i
was
you

just
now
in
a
traveler
trim
and
the
sullen

that
prowled
about

lost
a
prey
in
him
and
i
was
jules

while
the

songs
from

the
poem
is
divided
into
five
parts
each
of
which
describes
an
important
period
in
the
experience
of
paracelsus
the
celebrated
physician
alchemist
and
philosopher
of
the
sixteenth
century
book
i
tells
of
the
eagerness
and
pride
with
which
he
set
out
in
his
youth
to
compass
all
knowledge
he
believed
himself
commissioned
of

to
learn
truth
and
to
give
it

mankind

and
iii
show
him
followed
and
idolized
by
multitudes
to
whom
he
imparts
the
fragments
of
knowledge
he
has
gained
but
though
these
fragments
seem
to
his
disciples
the
sum
and
substance
of
wisdom
his
own
mind
is
preoccupied
with
a
desolating
certainty
that
he
has
hardly
touched
on
the
outer
confines
of
truth
in
book
iv
after
experiencing
the
ingratitude
of
his
fickle
adherents
he
is
represented
as
abjuring
the
dreams
of
his
youth
at
this
point
comes
the
first
of
the
three
songs
given
in
the
text
he
builds
an
imaginary
altar
on
which
he
offers
up
the
aspirations
the
hopes
the
plans
with
which

and
this

is
steeped
in
the
sentiment
of
the

but
as
before
browning
quickly
slides
away
from
the
beauty
of
inanimate
nature
into
a
record
of
the
animals
that
haunt
the
streams
he
could
not
get

alone
he
must
people
them

this

records

defection

who
this

be
was
for

time
a
matter

conjecture
wordsworth
southey
and
charles
kingsley
all
of
whom
had
gone
from
radicalism
in
their
youth
to
conservatism
in
their
old
age
were
severally
proposed
as
the
original
of
browning
portrait
the
poem
was
published
in
two
years
after
wordsworth
was
made
poet
laureate
early
in
wordsworth
was
presented
at
court
a
proceeding
which
aroused
comment
sometimes
amused
sometimes
indignant
from
those
who
recalled
the
poet
early
scorn
of
rank
and
titles
browning
and
miss
barrett
exchanged
several
gay
letters
on
this
subject
in
may
in
commenting
on
a
letter
from
miss
martineau
describing
wordsworth
in
his
home
in
browning
wrote
did
not
shelley
say
long
ago
had
no
more
imagination
than
a
though
in
those
days
he
used
to
walk
about
france
and
flanders
like
a
man
he
is
comfortable
in
his
worldly
affairs
and
just
this
comes
of
it
he
lives
the
best
twenty
years
of
his
life
after
the
way
of
his
own
heart
and
when
one
presses
in
to
see
the
result
of
his
rare
experiment
what
the
alchemist
whom
fortune
has
allowed
to
get
all
his
coveted
materials
and
set
to
work
at
last
with
fire
and
melting
pot
what
he
produces
after
all
the
talk
of
him
and
the
like
of
him
why
you
get
et
a
man
at
the
mercy
of
the
tongs
and
shovel
in
later
life
however
browning
spoke
of
wordsworth
in
a
different
tone
in
a
letter
to
grosart
written
he
said
i
have
been
asked
the
question
you
now
address
me
with
and
as
duly
answered
i
ca
remember
how
many
times
there
is
no
sort
of
objection
to
one
more
assurance
or
rather
confession
on
my
part
that
i
in
my
hasty
youth
presume
to
use
the
great
and
venerated
personality
of
wordsworth
as
a
sort
of
painter
model
one
from
which
this
or
the
other
particular
feature
may
be
selected
and
turned
to
account
had
i
intended
more
above
all
such
a
boldness
as
portraying
the
entire
man
i
should
not
have
talked
about
of
silver
and
bits
of
ribbon
these
never
influenced
the
change
of
politics
in
the
great
poet
whose
defection
nevertheless
accompanied
as
it
was
by
a
regular
of
his
special
party
was
to
my
private
apprehension
and
even
mature
consideration
an
event
to
deplore
but
just
as
in
the
tapestry
on
my
wall
i
can
recognize
figures
which
have
a
fancy
on
occasion
that
though
truly
enough
thus
derived
yet
would
be
preposterous
as
a
copy
so
though
i
dare
not
deny
the
original
of
my
little
poem
i
altogether
refuse
to
have
it
considered
as
the
effigies
of
such
a
moral
and
intellectual
superiority
for
an
interesting
parallelism
in
theme
see
whittier
ichabod
the
reference
is
to
the
lower
classes
whom
the
liberals
were
endeavoring
to
rouse
to
aspiration
and
action
the
conservatives
opposed
such
beginnings
of
independence
fight
on
it
is
the
deserting
leader
who
is
exhorted
to
fight
well
though
it
is
pain
to
have
him
desert
their
party
they
have
gloried
in
his
power
and
it
would
be
an
even
greater
pain
to
see
him
weak
they
wish
him
to
fight
well
even
though
their
cause
is
thereby
menaced
how
they
brought
the
good
news
from
ghent
to
aix
this
poem
was
written
during
browning
first
journey
to
italy
in
he
sailed
from
london
in
a
merchant
vessel
bound
for
trieste
on
which
he
found
himself
the
only
passenger
the
weather
was
stormy
and
for
the
first
fortnight
browning
was
extremely
as
they
passed
through
the
straights
of
gibraltar
the
captain
supported
him
upon
deck
that
he
might
not
lose
the
sight
of
the
composition
of
the
poem
he
says
i
wrote
it
under
the
bulwark
of
a
vessel
off
the
african
coast
after
i
had
been
at
sea
long
enough
to
appreciate
even
the
fancy
of
a
gallop
on
the
back
of
a
certain
good
horse
there
in
my
stable
at
home
the
poem
was
written
in
pencil
on
the
flyleaf
of
a
favorite
book
of
his
browning
says
that
there
was
no
sort
of
historical
foundation
for
the
story
but
the
pacification
of
ghent
in
has
been
suggested
as
an
appropriate
background
the
incident
narrated
could
naturally
belong
to
the
efforts
of
the
united
cities
of
holland
zealand
and
the
southern
netherlands
to
combat
the
tyranny
of
philip
ii
of
this
line
miss
barrett
wrote
it
drew
us
out
into
the
night
as

the
distance
from
ghent
to

is
something
over
a
hundred

the
first

gave
out
at

about
eighty
miles
from

the
second

at

and

a

poem
appeared
in

under
the
title

the

name
is
a
description
of
a
garden
by
a
lover
whose
conception
of
its
beauty
is
heightened
and
made
vital
by
the
memories
it
enshrines
of
this
poem
miss
barrett
wrote
to
browning
then
the
fancies
some
of
the
stanzas
about
the
name
of
the
flower
with
such
exquisite
music
in
them
and
grace
of
every
kind
and
with
that
beautiful
and
musical
use
of
the
word
which
i
never
remember
having
seen
used
in
relation
to
sound
before
it
does
to
mate
with
your
quiet

these
poems
were
published
originally
simply
as
night
and
morning
the
second
of
these
love
lyrics
is
somewhat
difficult
to
interpret
if
the
man
is
speaking
the
him
in
must
refer
to
the
sun
in
any
case
after
the
isolation
with
the
woman
he
loved
as
described
in
the
first
poem
there
comes
with
the
morning
a
sense
of
the
world
of
action
to
which
the
man
must
return
the
two
poems
are
fully
discussed
in
volume
vii
april
may
the
poems
are
noteworthy
for
the
fusion
of
human
emotion
and
natural
scenery
and
for
the
startlingly
specific
phrasing
of
the
first
quatrain
evelyn

in
this
lyric
are
embodied
browning
faith
in
personal
immortality
his
belief
in
the
permanence
of
true
love
and
in
the
value
of
love
though
unrequited
in
this
world
from
this
point
on
through

the
lover
repeats
what
he
shall
say
to
evelyn
hope
when
in
the
life
to
come
he
claims
her
love
among
the
ruins
a
man
is
on
his
way
across
the
fields
to
a
turret
where
he
is
to
meet
the
girl
he
loves
as
he
walks
through
the
solitary
pastures
he
mentally
recreates
the
powerful
life
and
varied
interests
of
the
city
which
tradition
has
it
once
occupied
this
site
and
he
seems
to
be
absorbed
in
a
melancholy
recognition
of
the
evanescence
of
human
glory
the
girl
is
not
mentioned
till
stanza
does
the
emphasis
on
the
scenery
and
its
historic
associations
unduly
minimize
the
love
element
of
the
poem
or
is
the
whole
picture
of
vanished
joy
and
woe
pride
and
defeat
but
a
background
against
which
stands
out
more
clearly
the
rapture
of
the
meeting
in
the
ruined
turret
this
phrase
refers
to
the
ruins
which
are
all
that
now
remains
of
the
centuries
of
folly
noise
and
sin

in
refers
apparently
to
the
fighters
and
the
others
of
the
first
part
of
the
stanza
up
at
a
villa
down
in
the
city
it
is
an
admirable
piece
of
work
crowded
with
keen
descriptions
of
nature
in
the
casentino
and
of
life
in
the
streets
of
florence
and
every
piece
of
description
is
so
filled

the
character

the
person

who
describes
them
a
petulant
humorous

angered

poor

that
browning
entirely
disappears
the
poem
retains
for
us
in
its
verse
and
indeed
in
its
light
rhythm
the
childlikeness
the
naïveté
the
simple
pleasures
the
ignorance
and
the
honest
boredom
with
the
solitudes
of
nature
of
a
whole
class
of
italians
not
only
of
the
time
when
it
was

these

sum
up
the
reasons
for
the
importance
of
the
art
that
strives
to
bring
the
invisible
full
into
play
it
may
be
and
faulty
but
it
is
greater
and
grander
than

art

of
its
greater

because
it
reaches

which
you
may
have
seen
before
the
poet
hates
the

prefers
the
days
of
the

in
the
fourteenth

when
italy
was
free

language
of

and
not

browning
is
writing
to
a

who
prefers
an

landscape
while
the

himself
declares
in
favor
of

our
loves
if
we
have
a
life
after
death
the
picture
is
a
field
of

with
red
poppies
scattered
through
the
wheat
it
is
interesting
to
note
how
many
of
the
trees
shrubs
flowers
and
fruits
in
browning
poems
are
those
of
southern
europe
his
poetry
of
nature
is
almost
as
distinctively
italian
as

to

this
poem
and
the
preceding

express
two
phases
of
the
poet
love
of
country
his
affection
for
the
physical
beauty
of
england
and
his
pride
in
her
political
freedom
in
the
first

he
turns
in
thought
from
the
glowing
color
of

to
the
more
delicate
loveliness
of

the

the

which
i
think
i
meant
is
altogether
of
and
i
probably
the
in
poetry
the
characteristic
most
often
attributed
to
a
snake
is
malignancy
but
in
this
picture
of
the
serpent
lying
dormant
and
waiting
for
the
sloughing
of
its
old
skin
in
the
springtime
when
it
will
come
forth
with
new
beauty
and
power
the
idea
presented
is
that
of
tremendous
force
temporarily
in
abeyance
the
the
boy
alone
in
the
field
tries
all
sorts
of
experiments
in
musical
attraction
on
the
animals
about
him
professor
albert
cook
suggests
that
browning
is
here
indebted
to
the
greek
pastoral
romance
of
and
see
smith
translation
in
the
bohn
edition
the
passages
read
in
part
as
follows
he
ran
through
all
variations
of
pastoral
melody
he
played
the
tune
which
the
oxen
obey
and
which
attracts
the
goats
that
in
which
the
sheep
delight
he
took
his
pipe
from
his
scrip
and
breathed
into
it
very
gently
the
goats
stood
still
merely
lifting
up
their
heads
next
he
played
the
pasture
tune
upon
which
they
all
put
down
their
heads
and
began
to
graze
now
he
produced
some
notes
soft
and
sweet
in
tone
at
once
his
herd
lay
down
after
this
he
piped
in
a
sharp
key
and
they
ran
off
to
the
woods
as
if
a
wolf
were
in
sight
these
quotations
serve
at
least
to
show
how
old
is
the
fancy
that
animals
are
affected
by
music
the
service
enjoined
on
the
men
of
the
house
of
levi
is
described
in

the
male
sapphire
exhibits
through
some
peculiarity

did
david
at
any
time
live
in
a
mountainous
country
pallid
note
the
character
of
the
similitudes
so
far
used
in
describing
saul
in
his
agony
he
is
like
the
his
rage
is
like
the
earthquake
that
may
tear
open
the
rock
but
at
the
same
time
sets
the
gold
free
his
final
release
from
the
evil
spirit
is
described
by
the
sudden
fall
of
the
avalanche
from
the
mountain
summit
the
look
in
his
eyes
as
he
comes
back
to
life
yet
seeing
nothing
in
life
to
desire
is
compared
to
pale
autumn
sunsets
seen
over
the
ocean
or
to
slow
sunsets
seen
over
a
desolate
hill
country
all
the
figures
contribute
to
our
impression
of
saul
power
and
majesty
my
etc
compare
this
passage
with
prologue
in
the
this
line
marks
a
change
in
the
direction
of
david
thought
up
to
stanza
x
it
was
the
glorious
past
that
he
had
been
urging
upon
saul
attention
but
now
he
realizes
that
true
inspiration
comes
not
so
much
from
a
of
one
achievements
as
from
the
thought
of
the
permanence
of
one
fame
and
one
deeds
behold
while
i
at
this
point
david
is
overcome
by
the
memory
of
the
sudden
spiritual
illumination
that
came
to
him
in
his
interview
with
saul
he
had
reached
the
summit
of
his
endeavor
and
yet
knew
himself
powerless
to
give
the
king
new
life
then
there
flashed
upon
him
the
truth
expressed
in
stanzas
he
breaks
off
in
lines
going
in
his
strong
feeling
ahead
of
his
story
and
commenting
on
what
is
described
in
stanza
xix
in
stanza
xv
he
resumes
his
narrative
david
watches
the
slow
coming
of
the
dawn
over
the
hill
on
which
is
situated
the
town
of
hebron
a
brook
near

it
is
fed
by

and
the

in
it

error
had
in

xv
is

account
of

and

the
choosing
of

david
was
that
god
had
proved
supreme
in
all
the
ways
in
which
a
human
being
could
test
knowledge
and
power
but
that
in
the
one
way
of
love
the
creature
might
surpass
the
creator
at
line
he
has
come
to
believe
in
the
infinitude
of
god
love
as
well
as
in
the
infinitude
of
his
power
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
george
eliot
in
gives
to
ignorant
dolly
winthrop
an
experience
and
a
philosophy
of
life
almost
identical
with
those
of
browning
david
a
prophecy
of
the
revelation
of
the
divine
in
the
human
the
coming
of
god
in
the
person
of
christ
it
is
the
human
in
the
divine
that
men
seek
and
love
in
the
old
testament
days
such
an
idea
though
foretold
and
longed
for
could
be
but
vaguely
conceived
except
in
moments
of
especial
insight
in
the
minds
of
like
david
herford
says
of
this
passage
david
is
occupied
with
no
speculative
question
but
with
the
practical
problem
of
saving
a
ruined
soul
and
neither
logical
ingenuity
nor
divine
suggestion
but
the
inherent
spiritual
significance
of
the
situation
urges
his
thought
along
the
lonely
path
of
prophecy
the
love
for
the
old
king
which
prompted
him
to
try
all
the
hidden
paths
of
his
soul
in
quest
of
healing
becomes
a
lighted
torch
by
which
he
tracks
out
the
meaning
of
the
world
and
the
still
unrevealed
purposes
of
god
until
the
energy
of
thought
culminates
in
vision
and
the
christ
stands
full
before
his
eyes
in
this
stanza
david
represents
all
existences
good
and
evil
spirits
all
animals
all
forms
of
nature
as
stirred
by
the
great
news
of
the
future

of
the

the
campagna
a
plain
around
the
city
of

was
in
ancient
times
the

it
is
now
dotted
with
ruins
there
is
a
solemnity
and
beauty
about
the
campagna
entirely
its
own
to
the
reflective
mind
this
ghost
of
old
rome
is
full
of
suggestion
its
vast
almost
limitless
extent
as
it
seems
to
the
traveler
its
abundant
herbage
and
floral
wealth
in
early
spring
its
desolation
its
crumbling
monuments
and
its
evidences
of
a
vanished
civilization
fill
the
mind
with
a
sweet
sadness
which
readily
awakens
the
longing
for

infinite
spoken

there
is
a
gulf
which
not
the
profoundest

can
fathom
which
not
the
love
can
overreach
the
gulf
of
individuality
it
is
those
who
have
loved
most
deeply
who
recognize
most
acutely
this
always
pathetic
and
often
terrifying
isolation
of
the
soul
none
save
the
weak
can
believe
in
the
absolute
union
of
two
spirits
no
man
no
poet
assuredly
could
love
as
browning
loved
and
fail
to
be
aware
often
with
vague
anger
and
bitterness
no
doubt
of
this
insuperable
isolation
even
when
spirit
seemed
to
leap
to
spirit

the
touch

a

on

mind
some
months
after

childe

to
the
dark

came
orr
of
browning
says
of
this
poem
we
can
connect
no
idea
of
definite
pursuit
or
attainment
with
a
series
of
facts
so
and
so
disjointed
still
less
extract
from
it
a
definite
moral
and
we
are
reduced
to
taking
the
poem
as
a
simple
work
of
fancy
built
up
of
picturesque
impressions
which
have
separately
or
collectively
produced
themselves
in
the
author
mind
and
she
adds
in
a
note
i
may
venture
to
state
that
these
picturesque
materials
included
a
tower
which
browning
once
saw
in
the
carrara
mountains
a
painting
which
caught
his
eye
years
later
in
paris
and
the
figure
of
a
horse
in
the
tapestry
in
his
own
welded
together
in
the
remembrance
of
the
line
from
which
forms
the
heading
of
the
poem
the
possible
allegorical
signification
of
the
poem
has
been
the
subject
of
much
and
often
of
singularly
futile
discussion
furnivall
said
he
had
asked
browning
if
it
was
an
allegory
and
in
answer
had
on
three
separate
occasions
received
an
emphatic
statement
that
it
was
simply
a
dramatic
creation
called
forth
by
a
line
of
shakspere
p
yet
allegorical
interpretations
continue
to
be
made
according
to
one
line
of
interpretation
the
pilgrim
is
a
misdirected
by
the
lying
spirit
the
hoary
cripple
and
when
he
blows
the
it
is
as
a
warning
to
others
that
he
has
failed
in
his
quest
and
that
the
way
to
the
dark
tower
is
the
way
of
destruction
and
death
berdoe
according
to
other
readings
of
the
tale
the
blast
which
the
pilgrim
blows
at
the
end
of
his
quest
is
one
of
spiritual
victory
and
incitement
to
others
when
the
rev
john
chadwick
visited
the
poet
and
asked
him
if
constancy
to
an
ideal
he
that
endureth
to
the
end
shall
be
saved
was
not
a
sufficient
understanding
of
the
central
purpose
of
the
poem
browning
said
yes
just
about
that
with
constancy
to
an
ideal
as
the
central
purpose
the
details
of
this
poem
without
being
minutely
interpreted
may
yet
serve
as
a
representation
of
the
depression
the
hopelessness
the
dullness
and
deadness
of
soul
the
doubt
and
terror
even
of
the
man
who

this

is
the
story
of

out
his
actual
life

misinterpretations

it

in

the
interest
which
as
a

he
takes
in

manifestations
of
life
is
popularly
supposed
to
be

triumph
was
as
as
a
fire
of
straw
the
monks
were
delighted
with
the
realism
of
the
painting
but
when
the
prior
and
the
critics
came
they
declared
that
such
homage
to
the
perishable
clay
was
a
mere
devil
game
the
business
of
the
painter
they
said
was
to
ignore
the
body
and
paint
the
soul
note
the
difficulty
the
prior
experiences
when
he
tries
to
describe
the
soul

master
of

school
of

art
an

idea
of
painting
he
says
that
it
is
nonsense
to
ignore
the
body
in
order
to
make
the
soul
preëminent
that
the
painter
should
go
a
double
step
and
paint
both
body
and
soul
he
may
make
the
face
of
a
girl
as
lovely
and
as
possible
and
at
the

time
show
her
soul
in
her
face

long
out

but
he
can
not
forget
how
certain
the
monks
were
that
he
had
chosen
the
wrong
path

that
he
could
never
equal

tom
browning
followed
good
authority
in
making
masaccio
a
pupil
of
fra
lippo
lippi
but
in
point
of
fact
he
was
probably
the
master
whose
works
fra
lippo
studied
lübke
of
ii
says
of
guidi
in
his
exceedingly
short
life
he
rapidly
traversed
the
various
stages
of
development
of
earlier
art
and
pressed
on
with
a
bold
confidence
to
a
greatness
and
power
of
vision
which
have
rendered
his
works
the
characteristic
ones
of
an
epoch
and
his
example
a
decisive
influence
in
all
the
art
of
the
fifteenth
century
almost
every
master
in
the
fifteenth
century
studied
these
great
works
and
learned
from
them
one
of
the
first
of
these
masters
was
fra

lippi
the
important
point
is
that
fra
lippo
and
masaccio
were
both
pioneers
in
the
new
art
which
took
infinite
pains
in
the
representation
of

to

in

with

these
are
the
first
fruits
of
his
flowering
manhood
when
the
bright
and
buoyant
genius
in
him
had
free
play
and
large
delight
in
its
handiwork
when
the
fresh
interest
of
invention
was
still

and

pleasure
in
the
play
of
life
the
power
of
motion
and
variety
before
the
old
strength
of

of
flight
had
passed
from

eye
the
old
pride
and
energy
of
enjoyment
had
gone
out

change
fell
upon
him

his

no

him

not
then
as

that
we
must
deny
andrea
del

the
right
to
rank
with
the
very
greatest
it
is
as
an
artist
using
the
word
in
its

sense
that
he
falls
below

p
ruskin
says
of
this
poem
robert
browning
is
unerring
in
every
sentence
he
writes
of
the
middle
ages
always
vital
right
and
profound
so
that
in
the
matter
of
art
with
which
we
are
specially
concerned
there
is
hardly
a
principle
connected
with
the
medieval
temper
that
he
has
not
struck
upon
in
these
seemingly
careless
and
too
rugged
lines
of
his
i
know
no
other
piece
of
modern
english
prose
or
poetry
in
which
there
is
so
much
told
as
in

spirit

worldliness
inconsistency
pride
hypocrisy
ignorance

itself

many
lines
browning
also
being
the
antecedent
work

it
was
inevitable
that
the
great
period
of
the
renaissance
should
produce
men
of
the
type
of
the
bishop
of
praxed
it
would
be
grossly
unfair
to
set
him
down
as
the
type
of
the
churchmen
of
his
time
berdoe
saith
the
preacher
cf
ll
as
illustrative
of
the
religious
professionalism
of
the
bishop
talk
he
drops
into
the
ecclesiastical
conception
of
life
and
death
and
into
the
phraseology
of
his
order

is

elaborate
carving
planned
for

show
not
only
that
the
bishop
covets
what
is
costly
but
that
his
highly
cultivated
taste
knows
real
beauty
the
eagerness
of
the
bishop
for
the
lump
of
the
has
made
him
steal
even
from
his
own
church
a
basket
made
of
rushes
used
for
packing
olives
pans

the
underlying
paganism
of
the

the

of

therefore
about
the
last
quarter
of
the

cleon
had
heard
so
vaguely
about
the
christian
religion
that
he
did
not
know
the
difference
between
christ
and
paul
the
doctrine
spoken
of
in
the
last
line
was
the
christian
teaching
concerning
immortality
the
greek
cleon
had
felt
a
longing
to
believe
in
another
existence
in
which
man
would
have
unlimited
capability
for
joy
but
zeus
had
revealed
no
such
doctrine
and
the
cultivated
greek
was
not
ready
to
receive
it

a
man

the

probably
an
example

was
his
great
poem
the
in
which
were
caustic
sketches
of
evil
men
of

sorts
the
sketch
in

lines
is
made
up
from
two
descriptions
cantos
of

the
one
to
his
country
the
other
to

the
second
of

his

savors
of
disrelish
because
of
the
grumbling

because
of
the
ungracious
irritation
into
which
he
has
been
betrayed
even
when
taxing
his
power
to
the
utmost
in

he
must
hold
steadily
to
his
majesty

he

abt
vogler
abbé
or
abt
vogler
was
a
catholic
priest
well
known
a
century
ago
as
an
organist
and
a
composer
he
founded
three
schools
of
music
one
at
mannheim
one
at
stockholm
and
one
at
darmstadt
he
was
especially
noted
for
his
organ
recitals
as
many
as
tickets
having
been
sold
for
a
single
recital
in
amsterdam
in
it
was
said
that
he
had
then
given
over
a
thousand
organ
concerts
his
knowledge
of
acoustics
and
his
consequent
skill
in
combining
the
stops
enabled
him
to
bring
much
power
and
variety
from
organs
with
fewer
pipes
than
were
generally
considered
necessary
the
remodeling
and
simplification
of
organs
was
one
of
his
most
eagerly
pursued
activities
he
not
only
rearranged
the
pipes
but
he
introduced
free
reeds
through
some
skillful
swedish
he
was
at
last
enabled
to
have
an
organ
small
enough
to
be
portable
and
constructed
according
to
his
ideas
this
he
called
an
orchestrion
of
vogler
power
as
an
organist
rinck
says
his
organ
playing
was
grand
effective
in
the
utmost
degree
it
was
however
when
he
was
improvising
that
his
power
was
most
astonishing
once
at
a
musical
soirée
vogler
and
beethoven
extemporized
alternately
each
giving
the
other
a
theme
and
gansbacher
records
the
pitch
of
enthusiasm
to
which
he
was
roused
by
vogler
masterly
playing
three
of
voglers
most
famous
pupils
at
darmstadt
were
meyerbeer
gansbacher
and
carl
maria
von
weber
the
last
of
these
gives
an
attractive
picture
of
the
musician
extemporizing
in
the
old
church
at
darmstadt
never
says
weber
did
vogler
in
his
extemporization
drink
more
deeply
at
the
source
of
all
beauty
than
when
before
his
three
dear
boys
as
he
liked
to
call
us
he
drew
from
the
organ
angelic
voices
and
word
of
thunder
browning
poem
records
the
experiences
of
the
musician
in
one
of
these
moods
of
rapturous
creation
the
argument
of
the
poem
is
thus
given
by
stopford
brooke
in
poetry
of
robert
page
when
solomon
pronounced
the
name
of
god
all
the
spirits
good
and
bad
assembled
to
do
his
will
and
build
his
palace
and
when
i
abt
vogler
touched
the
keys
i
called
the
spirits
of
sound
to
me
and
they
have
built
my
palace
of
music
and
to
inhabit
it
all
the
great
dead
came
back
till
in
the
vision
i
made
a
perfect
music
nay
for
a
moment
i
touched
in
it
the
infinite
perfection
but
now
it
is
gone
i
can
not
bring
it
back
had
i
painted
it
had
i
written
it
i
might
have
explained
it
but
in
music
out
of
the
sounds
something
emerges
which
is
above
the
sounds
and
that
ineffable
thing
i
touched
and
lost
i
took
the
sounds
of
earth
and
out
of
them
came
a
fourth
sound
nay
not
a
sound
but
a
star
this
was
a
flash
of
god
will
which
opened
the
eternal
to
me
for
a
moment
and
i
shall
find
it
again
in
the

from

of

not

build
a

for

which
memory

retain
as
a
ground
of
aspiration
are
not
lost
to
us
though
they
seem
to
die
in
their
immediate
passage
their
music
has
its
home
in
the
will
of
god
and
we
shall
find
them
completed
there
in
jewish
legend
it
is
said
that
solomon
had
power
over
angels
and
demons
through
a
seal
on
which
the
most
great
name
of
god
was
engraved
one
would
bury
his
this
description
of
the
foundations
of
the
palace
is
not
unlike

account
of
the
work
of
the
fallen
angels
in
building
the
palace
in
hell
i
that
fabric
huge
was
as
magical
in
its
construction
as
the
palace
of
abt
vogler
for
though
it
was
not
built

like

each
of
which
looks
like
a

fire
had
been
going
on
for
an
hour
and
by
the
time
we
arrived
there
was
nearly
completed

of
this

were

rabbi
ben

ben
ezra
was
an
eminent
jewish
rabbi
of
the
middle
ages
his
on
the
books
of
the
old
testament
are
of
great
value
campbell
who
has
studied
browning
poem
in
connection
with
the
writings
of
the
real
rabbi
ben
ezra
thinks
that
the
distinctive
features
of
the
rabbi
of
the
poem
and
the
philosophy
ascribed
to
him
were
drawn
from
the
works
of
the
historical
rabbi
the
keynote
of
whose
teaching
was
that
the
essential
life
of
man
is
the
life
of
the
soul
and
that
age
is
more
important
than
youth

cf
also

message
to

old
along

cf
lines
see
matthew
arnold
is
time
to
grow
old
for
a
beautiful
statement
of
the
pessimistic
attitude
toward
old
age
it
would
be
folly
says
the
rabbi
to
object
to
the
unreasoning
ambitions
the
fluctuations
of
desire
the
hopes
and
fears
of
youth
in
fact
ll
he
counts
these
very
aspirations
toward
the
impossible
this
very
state
of
mental
and
spiritual
unrest
and
doubt
a
proof
of
the
spark
of
divinity
which
separates
men
from
beasts
and
allies
them
to
god
it
is
a
characteristic
browning
doctrine
that
conflict
struggle
the
pangs
and
throes
of
learning
are
the
stimuli
through
which
character
develops
cf
in
lines
the
rabbi
had
urged
the
subservience
of
the
body
to
the
soul
but
in
these
lines
he
shows
that
the
life
of
the
flesh
is
not
to
be
underestimated
that
ideal
progress
comes
from
a
just
alliance
of
the
soul
and
the
body
see
tennyson
simeon
stylites
for
an
account
of
the
ascetic
ideal
in
its
lowest
form
brave
and
in
prospice
death
is
reckoned
an
adversary
to
be
courageously
met
and
overcome
here
the
rabbi
is
represented
as
fearless
and
unperplexed
as
he
contemplates
the
new
life
he
will
lead
after
death
in
both
poems
we
find
unquestioning
belief
in
an
active
and
progressive
and
happy
life
after
death
ended
i
shall
etc
compare
tennyson
by
an
evolutionist
the
fire
in
this
figure
the
fire
stands
for
the
conflicts
of
life
the
gold
for
whatever
has
proved
of
permanent
worth
and
the
ashes
for
whatever
has
failed
to
stand
the
test
of
time
and
experience
certain
the
moment
between
the
fading
of
the
sunset
glory
and
the
shutting
down
of
evening
darkness
is
here
selected
as
the
moment
in
which
to
appraise
the
work
of
the
day
in
the
application
of
the
simile
to
the
life
of
man
lines
the
moment
apparently
refers
to
old
age
when
man
has
leisure
and
wisdom
to
appraise
the
past
the
life
of
his
adventure
brave
and
new
after
death
in
old
pictures
in
florence
browning
applies
this
idea
to
the
development
of
art
as
soon
as
men
were
content
to
repose
in
the
perfection
of
greek
art
the
thing
found
made
stagnation
ensued
the
new
life
of
art
came
when
men
strove
for
something
new
and
original
even
though
their
first
attempts
were
crude
acts
uncouth
let
thee
feel
the
solitude
of
age
gives
a
chance
for
unhampered
thought
one
of
the
things
he
has
learned
is
that
any
judgment
to
be
fair
must
take
into
account
instincts
efforts
desires
as
well
as
accomplishment
this
metaphor
of
the
wheel
is
found
in
lxiv
xviii
ix
throughout
this
metaphor
as
browning
uses
it
man
seems
to
be
passive
clay
in
the
hands
of
the
potter
and
under
the
power
of
the
machinery
the
potter
uses
to
give
the
soul
its
bent
the
tone
of
the
whole
poem
is
however
one
of
strenuous
endeavor
ardor
effort
progress
are
the
keynotes
of
life
from
youth
to
age
but
life
is
finally
counted
a
divine
training
for
the
service
of
god
and
in
this
training
the
pious
rabbi
sees
joined
the
will
of
man
and
the
care
and
guidance
of
god
that
etc
cf
abt
vogler
ll
caliban
upon
setebos
the
idea
of
this
poem
was
evolved
from
shakspere
caliban
a
strange
misshapen
being
one
of
the
servants
of
prospero
in
he
was
the
son
of
a
foul
witch
who
had
potent
ministers
and
could
control
moon
and
tides
but
could
not
undo
her
own
hateful
sorceries
and
who
worshiped
a
god
called
setebos
morally
caliban
was
insensible
to
kindness
had
bestial
passions
was
cowardly
vengeful
superstitious
he
had
keen
animal
instincts
and
knew
the
island
well
he
understood
prospero
in
some
measure
learned
to
talk
to
know
the
stars
to
compose
poetry
and
took
pleasure
in
music
etc
a
quotation
from
this
sentence
is
the
keynote
of
caliban
theological
speculations
for
he
will
instead
of
i
will
through
most
of
the
poem
caliban
speaks
of
himself
in
the
third
person
as
a
child
does
but
note
lines
where
caliban
rises
to
unusual
mental
heights
under
the
stimulus
of
the
and
uses
the
first
person
how
is
it
in
ll
this
portion
of
caliban
soliloquy
and
the
portion
in
lines
give
the
setting
for
his
speculations
the
hot
still
summer
day
creates
a
mood
in
which
caliban
ideas
flow
out
easily
into
speech
the
thunderstorm
at
the
end
abruptly
calls
him
back
from
his
speculations
to
his
normal
state
of
subservience
and
superstitious
fear
the
god
of
the
patagonians
when
the
natives
were
taken
prisoners
by
magellan
they
cryed
upon
their
devil
setebos
to
help
them
eden
of
the
pronoun
of
the
third
person
when
referring
to
setebos
is
capitalized
came
of
being
ill
at
each
step
in
caliban
reasoning
proceeds
from
some
personal
experience
or
observation
in
this
case
he
reasons
from
the
fish
to
setebos
caliban
attributes
to
setebos
unlimited
power
to
create
and
control
in
whatever
is
comparatively
near
at
hand
and
changeable
but
caliban
had
been
affected
by
the
mystery
of
the
starry
heavens
the
remoteness
and
fixedness
of
the
stars
had
suggested
a
quiet
unalterable
passionless
force
beyond
setebos
who
must
therefore
have
limitations
he
did
not
make
the
stars
he
can
not
create
a
mate
like
himself
ll
he
can
not
change
his
nature
so
as
to
be
like
the
quiet
above
him
ll
hence
like
the
fish
setebos
had
a
dissatisfied
consciousness
of
a
bliss
he
was
not
born
for
discontent
with
himself
spite
envy
restlessness
love
of
power
as
a
means
of
distraction
are
the
motives
that
according
to
caliban
reasoning
actuated
setebos
in
his
creation
of
the
world
fowls
here
beast
and
creeping
browning
remarkably
minute
and
accurate
knowledge
of
small
animals
is
well
illustrated
by
this
poem
for
further
illustration
see
the
last
soliloquy
in
and
the
lyric
thus
the
mayne
glideth
etc
in
determining
the
natural
attitude
of
setebos
toward
his
creations
the
formula
caliban
uses
is
caliban
plus
power
equals
setebos
the
illustration
from
the
bird
ll
shows
cruelty
and
unreasoning
capricious
exercise
of
power
the
caprice
of
setebos
is
further
emphasized
in
ll
cut
a
in
his
attitude
toward
his
creatures
setebos
is
envious
of
all
human
worth
or
happiness
if
it
is
for
a
moment
unconscious
of
absolute
dependence
on
him
peeped
etc
as
caliban
gets
some
poor
solace
out
of
imitating
prospero
so
one
reason
for
setebos
creation
of
the
world
was
a
attempt
to
delude
himself
into
apparent
content
his
imitations
his
make
believes
are
the
unwilling
homage
his
weakness
pays
to
the
power
of
the
quiet
the
weaknesses
of
all
living
beings
were
special
devices
whereby
setebos
could
through
need
and
fear
torture
and
rule
setebos
worked
also
out
of
pure
ennui
he
liked
the
exercise
of
power
he
liked
to
use
his
wit
and
he
needed
distraction
setebos
hates
and
favors
human
beings
without
discoverable
reason
it
is
impossible
to
discover
a
way
to
please
setebos
his
favor
goes
by
caprice
as
does
caliban
with
the
daring
squirrel
and
the
terrified
urchin
who
please
one
day
and
doing
the
same
things
the
next
would
bring
down
vengeance
the
only
philosophy
at
which
caliban
can
arrive
is
that
it
is
best
not
to
be
too
happy
simulated
misery
is
more
likely
to
escape
than
any
show
of
happiness
may

large

to

grew

the

express
one
of
the
fundamental
ideas
of
browning
poetry
under
the
figure
of
the
wall
with
its
pulsating
robe
of
vines
and
the
eagerness
of
the
lover
to
penetrate
to
the
life

he
sets
forth
his
thought
of
the
barrier
between
himself

a

the

to
be
interpreted
as
referring
to
his

three

browning
poems

the

house

refer
with
more
or
less
explicitness
to

stanza
in

contains
a
quotation
from

the
effect
that
in
his

shakspere
revealed

both
combat
this

own

a

direct
statement
of

even
from

it
is
not

to
find
his

in

narrated
just

what
this

is
in

nature

the

under

each
poem
in

shows
the
lack

some
element
that
would

the

refers
to
the
spirit
of
love
with
its
inspiring
transforming
power
never
the
time
and
the
place
this
poem
was
published
in
in
it
is
doubtless
to
be
grouped
with
the
poems
that
refer
directly
to
browning
the
patriot
browning
says
that
this
poem
has
no
direct
historical
reference
he
calls
it
an
old
story
because
in
all
ages
men
have
experienced
this
unjust
reversal
of
public
approval
the
poem
is
merely
an
imaginative
dramatic
representation
of
the
fickleness
of
popular
favor
instans
tyrannus
the
title
of
this
poem
means
threatening
tyrant
it
comes
from

man

the
just
man
is
not
frightened
by
the
frown
of
the
threatening
tyrant
vullus
instantis
archdeacon
farrar
refers
the
incidents
to
persecution
of
the
early
christians
the
poem
certainly
deals
with
some
period
when
the
ruler
of
a
great
realm
had
unlimited
power
to
follow
out
his
most
insignificant
animosities
and
when
just
men
and
just
causes
had
no
human
recourse
the
general
idea
of
the
poem
is
clear
and
forcible
but
there
are
many
minor
difficulties
of
interpretation
was
his
force
an
ironic
question
the
man
groveled
because
he
was
powerless
to
resist
and
line
because
resistance
might
bring
even
worse
punishment
the
etc
if
the
man
could
be
made
rich
if
his
life
could
be
crowded
with
pleasures
if
there
could
be
found
relatives
or
friends
whom
he
loved
then
there
would
be
obvious
ways
of
hurting
him
he
would
stand
forth
in
sufficient
importance
to
make
the
swing
of
the
tyrant
hand
effective
but
as
it
is
the
man
poverty
and
friendlessness
and
meagerness
of
life
render
it
difficult
to
find
out
vulnerable
points
of
attack
he
remains
hidden
and
like
the
midge
of
the
egg
of
an
insect
is
safe
through
his
very
insignificance
that
which
is
poured
out
profusely
the
is
a
vessel
with
one
handle
and
a
long
narrow
neck
or
spout
a
etc
the
tyrant
goes
through
various
changes
of
mood
in
his
attitude
toward
his
enemy
in
lines
he
feels
a
moment
of
contemptuous
compunction
at
the
man
suffering
and
recognizes
the
absurdity
of
a
contest
between
a
great
king
and
a
person
as
insignificant
as
a
tricksy
elf
a
toad
or
a
rat
but
in
line
his
mood
turns
he
perceives
that
the
burden
of
the
whole
matter
lies
in
the
incredibly
petty
nature
of
this
unconquerable
baffling
opposition
to
his
will
he
sees
how
the
situation
would
awaken
the
wonder
of
the
great
lords
who
abjectly
obey
his
lightest
word
but
he
concludes
that
after
all
the
small
becomes
great
if
it
vexes
you
etc
even
the
tyrant
sees
a
kind
of
grotesque
humor
as
he
narrates
first
the
elaborate
plans
to
entrap
and
crush
so
seemingly
powerless
a
foe
and
then
the
striking
reversal
of
position
when
the
man
proves
to
have
god
on
his
side
and
the
tyrant
becomes
the
one
to
cower
in
fear
the
italian

there

appreciation

already
given
a

visited

then
wrote

not
represent
a
definite
historic
incident

such
a
one
as
might
have
occurred
in

sutherland
orr
writes
that
while

was
one
day
strolling
through

wood
the
image
flashed
upon
him
of
someone
walking
alone
through

one
apparently
too
obscure
to
leave
a
trace
of
his
or
her
passage
yet
exercising
a

date

luigi
had
obtained
such
a
passport
for
vienna
for
that
night
it
was
however
suspected
that
this
was
a
mere
trick
to
give
a
wrong
notion
of
his
whereabouts
if
the
passport
should
prove
to
be

suspicions

would
be
confirmed
it
would
be
taken
for

that
he
belonged
to
the
carbonari

secret
society
of

patriots
he
would
be
arrested
and
sent
to
the
prison
at

if
he
should
go
to

he
is
to
be
let

the
officers
are
of

on
the

track

goes

it
is

temperament
has

action

the
song
has
a
great
effect
on

beside
his
mental
picture
of
the
hated
austrian
ruler
he
now
places
his
old

judged

to
put
out
of
the
way
in

that

he
hired

maffeo
did
so

him
by

deed

are
now

a
in
reality
maffeo
has
been
more
astute
than
they
thought
he
did
not
kill
the
child
but
kept
it
ready
to
produce
as
the
heir
to
the
estates
if
the
second
brother
at
any
time
proved
delinquent
in
the
required
payments
us
understand
one
he
believes
that
when
the
bishop
sees
himself
about
to
lose
the
estate
he
too
will
show
himself
ready
for
a
bargain
the
bishop
is
simply
to
keep
still
and
maffeo
will
see
that
the
heir
who
is
pippa
shall
be
finally
brought
to
shame
and
death
the
bishop
is
to
have
the
estates
and
maffeo
is
to
keep
his
gains
and
be
given
a
chance
to
escape
the
bishop
is
apparently
listening
to
the
tempter
when
he
hears
pippa
song
its
fresh
lilting
sweetness
and
especially
perhaps
the
wording
of
the
last
line
touch
