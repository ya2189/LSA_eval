king
cole
was
king
before
the
troubles
came
the
land
was
happy
while
he
held
the
helm
the
from
condicote
to
thame
watered
by
thames
and
green
with
many
an
elm
for
many
a
year
he
governed
well
his
realm
so
that
when
at
last
he
died
it
was
bereavement
to
the
countryside
so
good
so
had
he
been
in
life
that
when
he
reached
the
there
where
the
scales
are
even
the
sword
keen
the
acquitting
judges
granted
him
a
grace
aught
he
might
choose
red
black
from
king
to
ace
beneath
the
bright
arch
of
the
heaven
span
he
chose
to
wander
earth
the
friend
of
man
so
since
that
time
he
wanders
shore
and
shire
an
old
poor
wandering
man
with
glittering
eyes
helping
distressful
folk
to
their
desire
by
power
of
spirit
that
within
him
lies
gentle
he
is
and
quiet
and
most
wise
he
wears
a
ragged
grey
he
sings
sweet
words
and
where
he
walks
there
flutter
little
birds
and
when
the
planets
glow
as
dusk
begins
he
pipes
a
wooden
flute
to
music
old
men
hear
him
on
the
downs
in
lonely
inns
in
valley
woods
or
up
the
chiltern
wold
his
piping
feeds
the
starved
and
warms
the
cold
it
gives
the
beaten
courage
to
the
lost
it
brings
back
faith
that
lodestar
of
the
ghost
and
most
he
haunts
the
chalk
the
downs
and
chilterns
with
the
thames
between
there
still
the
berkshire
shepherds
see
him
walk
searching
the
unhelped
woe
with
instinct
keen
his
old
hat
stuck
with
green
his
flute
in
poke
and
little
singings
sweet
coming
from
birds
that
flutter
at
his
feet
not
long
ago
a
circus
wandered
there
where
good
king
cole
most
haunts
the
public
way
coming
from
reading
for
giles
fair
through
rain
unceasing
since
augustine
day
the
horses
spent
the
waggons
splashed
with
clay
the
men
with
heads
bowed
to
the
wester
roaring
heaving
the
up
the
hill
at
goring
wearily
plodding
up
the
hill
they
went
broken
by
bitter
weather
and
the
luck
six
vans
and
one
long
waggon
with
the
tent
and
piebald
horses
following
in
the
muck
dragging
their
tired
hooves
out
with
a
suck
and
heaving
on
like
some
defeated
tribe
bound
for
despair
with
death
upon
their
kibe
all
through
the
morn
the
circus
floundered
thus
the
nooning
found
them
at
the
crossing
roads
stopped
by
an
axle
splitting
in
its
truss
the
horses
drooped
and
stared
before
their
loads
dark
with
the
wet
they
were
and
cold
as
toads
the
men
were
busy
with
the
foundered
van
the
showman
stood
apart
a
beaten
man
he
did
not
heed
the
dripping
of
the
rain
nor
the
wood
roaring
nor
the
blotted
hill
he
stood
apart
and
bit
upon
his
pain
biting
the
bitter
meal
with
bitter
will
focussed
upon
himself
he
stood
stock
still
staring
unseeing
while
his
mind
repeated
this
is
the
end
i
ruined
i
defeated
from
time
to
time
a
haggard
woman
face
peered
at
him
from
a
van
and
then
withdrew

the
cowboy
van
the
wife
her
reddish
hair
in
papers
twisted
close
turned
wet
potatoes
round
against
the
knife
and
in
a
bucket
dropped
the
peelèd
seeds
from
the
hayrack
blew
about
the
place
the
smoke
out
of
the
waggon
chimneys
blew
from
wicker
creel
the
skinny
cockerel
crew
the
men
who
set
the
floundered
axle
straight
glanced
at
their
chief
and
each
man
nudged
his
mate
and
one
the
second
clown
a
youth
with
broken
teeth
discoloured
black
muttered
he
looks
a
treat
and
that
the
truth
i
had
enough
i
given
him
the
sack
he
took
his
wrench
arose
and
stretched
his
back
swore
at
a
piebald
pony
trying
to
bite
and
rolled
a
cigarette
and
begged
a
light
within
the
second
wife
who
leaped
the
hoops
nursed
sour
twins
her
son
and
jealousy
thinking
of
love
in
luckier
happier
troupes
known
on
the
roads
in
summers
now
gone
by
before
her
husband
had
a
roving
eye
before
the
baggage
with
red
hair
came
to
do
tight
rope
and
make
trouble
there
beside
the
vans
the
clown
old
circus
john
growled
to
the
juggler
as
he
sucked
his
briar
how
all
the
marrow
of
a
show
was
gone
since
women
came
to
sing
and
walk
the
wire
killing
the
clown
his
act
for
half
his
hire
killing
the
circus
trade
because
said
he
horses
and
us
are
what
men
want
to
see
the
juggler
was
a
young
man
even
in
the
mud
his
dainty
way
he
had
with
eyes
like
boxer
quick
and
keen
a
youth
with
legs
besprad
humming
in
baritone
a
ditty
sad
and
tapping
on
his
teeth
his
the
while
the
clown
suckt
pipe
and
spat
his
tales
molly
the
singer
watched
him
wearily
with
big
black
eyes
that
love
had
brimmed
with
tears
her
mop
of
short
cut
hair
was
blown
awry
her
firm
mouth
shewed
her
wiser
than
her
years
she
stroked
a
piebald
horse
and
pulled
his
ears
and
kissed
his
muzzle
while
her
eyes
betrayed
this
that
she
loved
the
juggler
not
the
jade
and
growling
in
a
group
the
music
stood
sucking
short
pipes
their
backs
against
the
rain
plotting
rebellion
in
a
bitter
mood
a
shilling
more
or
never
play
again
their
old
great
coats
were
foul
with
many
a
stain
weather
and
living
rough
had
stamped
their
faces
they
were
cast
clerks
old
sailors
old
hard
cases
within
the
cowboy
van
the
wife
her
reddish
hair
in
papers
twisted
close
turned
wet
potatoes
round
against
the
knife
and
in
a
bucket
dropped
the
peelèd
oes
her
little
girl
was
howling
from
her
blows
the
cowboy
smoked
and
with
a
spanner
whackt
the
metal
target
of
his
shooting
act
and
in
another
van
more
children
cried
from
being
beaten
or
for
being
chid
by
fathers
cross
or
mothers
made
savage
by
the
fortunes
that
betide
the
rain
dripped
from
the
waggons
the
drops
glid
along
the
pony
flanks
the
thick
boots
stamped
the
running
muck
for
warmth
and
hope
was
damped
yet
all
of
that
small
troupe
in
misery
stuck
were
there
by
virtue
of
their
nature
choosing
to
be
themselves
and
take
the
season
luck
counting
the
being
artists
worth
the
bruising
to
be
themselves
as
artists
even
if
losing
wealth
comfort
health
in
doing
as
they
chose
alone
of
all
life
ways
brought
peace
to
those
so
there
below
the
forlorn
woods
they
grumbled
stamping
for
warmth
and
shaking
off
the
rain
under
the
foundered
van
the
tinkers
fumbled
fishing
the
splitted
truss
with
wedge
and
chain
soon
all
was
done
the
van
could
go
again
men
cracked
their
whips
the
horses
shoulders
forged
up
to
the
collar
while
the
mud
disgorged
so
with
a
jangling
of
their
chains
they
went
lean
horses
swaying
vans
and
creaking
wheels
bright
raindrops
tilting
off
the
van
roof
pent
and
reedy
cockerels
crying
in
the
creels
smoke
driving
down
men
shouts
and
children
squeals
whips
cracking
and
the
hayrack
sheddings
blowing
the
showman
stood
aside
to
watch
them
going
what
with
the
rain
and
misery
making
mad
the
showman
never
saw
a
stranger
come
till
there
he
stood
a
stranger
roughly
clad
in
ragged
grey
of
woollen
spun
at
home
green
sprigs
were
in
his
hat
and
other
some
stuck
in
his
coat
he
bore
a
wooden
flute
and
redbreasts
hopped
and
carolled
at
his
foot
it
was
king

smiled

far
as
wallingford

sat
the
woman

food
for
king
cole
and
watched
him
as
he
fed
tears
trickled
down
her
cheeks
and
much
she
sighed
my
son
she
said
like
you
is
wandering
wide
i
know
not
where
a
beggar
in
the
street
for
all
i
know
without
a
crust
to
eat
he
never
could
abide
the
circus
life
illustration
climbed
aboard
and
sat
the
woman
spread
food
for
king
cole
and
watched
him
as
he
showman
it
was
my
fault
i
always
tell
my
wife
i
put
too
great
constraint
upon
his
will
things
would
be
changed
if
he
were
with
us
still
i
ought
not
to
have
forced
him
to
the
trade
cole
a
forced
thing
finds
a
vent
my
father
said
and
yet
a
quickening
tells
me
that
your
son
is
not
far
from
you
now
for
i
am
one
who
feels
these
things
like
comfort
in
the
heart
the
couple
watched
king
cole
and
shrank
apart
for
brightness
covered
him
with
glittering
tell
me
your
present
troubles
said
the
king
for
you
are
worn
what
sorrow
makes
you
sad
showman
why
nothing
sir
except
that
times
are
bad
rain
all
the
season
through
and
empty
tents
and
nothing
earned
for
stock
or
winter
rents
my
wife
there
ill
poor
soul
from
very
grief
and
now
no
hope
nor
prospect
of
relief
the
season
done
and
we
as
we
began
now
one
can
bear
one
troubles
being
a
man
but
what
i
can
not
bear
is
loss
of
friends
this
troupe
will
scatter
when
the
season
ends
my
clown
is
going
and
the
tricksey
three
who
juggle
and
do
turns
have
split
with
me
and
now
my
wife
too
ill
to
dance
and
all
my
music
ask
for
an
advance
there
must
be
poison
in
a
man
distress
that
makes
him
mad
and
people
like
him
less
well
men
are
men
but
what
i
can
not
bear
is
my
poor
bet
my
piebald
talking
mare
gone
curby
in
her
hocks
from
standing
up
that
the
last
drop
that
overfills
the
cup
my
bet

like
a
christian
friend
for
years

what
i

my
poor

my
piebald
talking
mare
gone
curby
in
her
hocks
from
standing
up
that
the
last
drop
that
overfills
the
cup
my
bet
been
like
a
christian
friend
for
his
ruined
roof
fell
on
him
in
a
rain
of
hidden
gold
that
built
it
up
again
so
courage
and
believe

city

like
new
pence
to
welcome
you

well
blessings
on
your
heart
for
speaking
so
it
may
be
that
the
tide
will
turn
at
last
but
royal
tours
have
crossed
me
in
the
past
and
killed
my
show
and
maybe
will
again
one
hopes
for
little
after
months
of
rain
and
the
little
that
one
hopes
one
does
not
get
wife
look
will
the
city
gates
with
sentries
set
showman
it
looks
to
me
as
if
the
road
were
barred
cole
they
are
some
soldiers
of
the
bodyguard
i
hope
the
heralds
of
your
fortune
change

d
hear
and
do
not
stop
to
bait
this
side
a
mile
for
that
the
order
march
the
showman
toppled
like
a
broken
arch
the
roared
upon
them
with
loud
lips
a
strangeness
followed
like
eclipse
they
passed
within
but
when
within
king
cole
slipped
from
the
van
to
head
the
leading
team
he
breathed
into
his
flute
his
very
soul
a
noise
like
waters
in
a
pebbly
stream
and
straight
the
spirits
that
inhabit
dream
came
round
him
and
the
roared
its
last
and
bright
the
shifted
as
it
passed
and
in
the
rush
of
sun
and
glittering
cloud
that
followed
on
the
storm
he
led
the
way
fluting
the
sodden
circus
through
the
crowd
that
trod
the
city
streets
in
holiday
and
lo
a
marvellous
thing
the
gouted
clay
splashed
on
the
waggons
and
the
horses
glowed
they
shone
like
embers
as
they
trod
the
road
and
round
the
tired
horses
came
the
powers
that
stir
men
spirits
waking
or
asleep
to
thoughts
like
planets
and
to
acts
like
flowers
out
of
the
inner
wisdom
beauty
deep
these
led
the
horses
and
as
marshalled
sheep
fronting
a
dog
in
line
the
people
stared
at
those
bright
waggons
led
by
the
and
as
they
marched
the
spirits
sang
and
all
the
horses
crested
to
the
tune
and
stept
like
centaurs
to
a
passionate
festival
with
shining
throats
that
mantling
criniers
swept
and
all
the
hearts
of
all
the
watchers
leapt
to
see
those
horses
passing
and
to
hear
that
song
that
came
like
blessing
to
the
ear
and
to
the
crowd
the
circus
artists
seemed
splendid
because
the
while
that
singing
quired
each
artist
was
the
part
that
he
had
dreamed
and
glittered
with
the
power
he
desired
women
and
men
no
longer
wet
or
tired
from
long
despair
now
shone
like
queens
and
kings
there
they
were
crowned
with
their
imaginings
and
with
them
walking
by
the
vans
there
came
the
wild
things
from
the
woodland
and
the
mead
the
red
stag
with
his
dame
branched
and
and
ever
taking
heed
rabbits
nibbling
at
the
weed
the
hares
that
box
by
moonlight
on
the
hill
the
bright
trout
death
the
otter
from
the
mill
there
with
his
mask
made
virtuous
came
the
fox
talking
of
landscape
while
he
thought
of
meat
weasels
brocks
stoats
and
the
mice
that
build
among
the
wheat
dormice
and
moles
with
little
hands
for
feet
the
that
gnaws
the
yellow
flag
toads
from
the
stone
and
merrows
from
the
quag
and
over
them
flew
birds
of
every
kind
whose
way
or
song
or
speed
or
beauty
brings
delight
and
understanding
to
the
mind
the
feathery
things
there
they
too
sang
amid
a
rush
of
wings
with
sweet
clear
cries
and
gleams
from
wing
and
crest
blue
scarlet
white
gold
plume
and
speckled
breast
and
all
the
vans
seemed
grown
with
living
leaves
and
living
flowers
the
best
september
knows
moist
poppies
scarlet
from
the
hilcote
sheaves
bine
that
runs
the
pale
candylips
and
those
intense
blue
blows
that
trail
the
porches
in
the
autumn
dusk
tempting
the
noiseless
moth
to
tongue
their
musk
so
tired
thus
so
tended
and
so
sung
they
crossed
the
city
through
the
marvelling
crowd
maids
with
wide
eyes
from
upper
windows
hung
the
children
waved
their
toys
and
sang
aloud
but
in
his
van
the
beaten
showman
bowed
his
head
upon
his
hands
and
wept
not
knowing
aught
of
what
passed
except
that
wind
was
blowing
all
through
the
town
the
fluting
led
them
on
but
near
the
western
gate
king
cole
retired
and
as
he
ceased
the
vans
no
longer
shone
the
bright
procession
dimmed
like
lamps
expired
again
with
muddy
vans
and
horses
tired
and
artists
cross
and
women
out
of
luck
the
sodden
circus
plodded
through
the
muck
the
crowd
of
following
children
loitered
home
maids
shut
the
windows
lest
more
rain
should
come
the
circus
left
the
streets
of
flowers
and
flags
king
cole
walked
with
it
huddling
in
his
rags
they
reached
the
western
gate
and
sought
to
pass

frowsy

farmer

green
field
beside
the
oxford
road
there
the
spent

load
the
tent

pitched
beneath
a
dropping
sky

tent
with
all
its
gear

while
a
poor

old
showman
by
god
our
lives
are
all
we
have
to
trust
cole
life
changes
every
day
and
ever
must
showman
it
has
not
changed
with
us
this
season
yet
cole
life
is
as
just
as
death
life
pays
its
debt
showman
what
justice
is
there
in
our
suffering
so
cole
this
that
not
knowing
we
should
try
to
know
showman
try
a
sweet
doctrine
for
a
broken
heart
cole
the
best
men
say
in
every
manly
part
showman
is
it
by
heaven
i
have
tried
it
i
tell
you
friend
your
justice
is
a
lie
your
comfort
is
a
lie
your
peace
a
fraud
your
trust
a
folly
and
your
cheer
a
gaud
i
know
what
men
are
having
gone
these
roads
poor
bankrupt
devils
sweating
under
loads
while
others
suck
their
blood
and
smile
and
smile
you
be
an
artist
on
the
roads
a
while
you
know
what
justice
comes
with
suffering
then
cole
friend
i
am
one
grown
old
with
sorrowing
men
showman
the
old
are
tamed
they
have
not
blood
to
feel
cole
they
blood
to
hurt
if
not
enough
to
heal
i
have
seen
sorrow
close
and
suffering
close
i
know
their
ways
with
men
if
any
knows
i
know
the
harshness
of
the
way
they
have
to
loose
the
base
and
prison
up
the
brave
i
know
that
some
have
found
the
depth
they
trod
in
deepest
sorrow
is
the
heart
of
god
up
on
the
bitter
iron
there
is
peace
in
the
dark
night
of
prison
comes
release
in
the
black
midnight
still
the
cock
will
crow
there
is
a
help
that
the
abandoned
know
deep
in
the
heart
that
conquerors
can
not
feel
abide
in
hope
the
turning
of
the
wheel
the
luck
will
alter
and
the
star
will
rise
his
presence
seemed
to
change
before
their
eyes
the
old
bent
ragged
glittering
wandering
fellow
with
thready
in
the
rided
yellow
of
cheek
and
eye
seemed
changed
to
one
who
held
earth
and
the
spirit
like
a
king
of
eld
he
spoke
again
you
have
been
kind
said
he
in
your
own
trouble
you
have
thought
of
me
god
will
repay
to
him
who
gives
is
given
corn
water
wine
the
world
the
starry
heaven
then
like
a
poor
old
man
he
took
his
way
back
to
the
city
while
the
showman
gazed
after
his
figure
like
a
man
amazed
wife
i
think
that
traveller
was
an
angel
sent
showman
a
most
strange
man
i
wonder
what
he
meant
wife
comfort
was
what
he
meant
in
our
distress
showman
no
words
of
his
can
make
our
trouble
less
wife
o
will
he
made
me
feel
the
luck
would
change
look
at
him
husband
there
is
something
strange
about
him
there
a
robin
redbreast
comes
hopping
about
his
feet
as
though
for
crumbs
and
little
tits
and
wrens
that
sing
perching
upon
him
showman
what
a
wondrous
thing
i
read
of
such
but
never
seen
it
wife
look
these
were
the
dishes
and
the
food
he
took
showman
yes
those
were
they
what
of
it
wife
did
he
eat
showman
yes
bread
and
cheese
he
would
not
touch
the
meat
wife
but
see
the
cheese
is
whole
the
loaf
unbroken
and
both
are
fresh
and
see
another
token
those
hard
green
apples
that
the
farmer
gave
have
grown
to
these
gold
globes
like
blenheims
brave
and
look
how
came
these
plums
of
pershore
here
showman
we
have
been
sitting
with
a
saint
my
dear
look
at
the
butterflies
like
floating
flowers
came
butterflies
the
souls
of
summer
hours
fluttering
about
the
van
red
admirals
rich
scarlet
and
pale
on
breathing
speeds
of
pitch
brimstones
like
yellow
poppy
petals
blown
brown
peacocks
in
their
purpled
roan
blue
silvered
things
that
haunt
the
grassy
chalk
green
hairstreaks
bright
as
green
shoots
on
a
stalk
and
that
dark
prince
the
oakwood
haunting
thing
dyed
with
blue
burnish
like
the
mallard
wing
he
was
a
saint
of
god
the
showman
cried
meanwhile
within
the
town
from
man
to
man
the
talk
about
the
wondrous
circus
ran
all
were
agreed
that
nothing
ever
known
had
thrilled
so
tense
the
marrow
in
their
bone
all
were
agreed
that
sights
so
beautiful
made
the
queen
court
with
all
its
soldiers
dull
made
all
the
masts
and
papered
strings
seem
fruit
of
death
not
lovely
living
things
and
some
said
loudly
that
though
time
were
short
men
still
might
hire
the
circus
for
the
court
and
some
agreeing
sought
the
mayor
hall
to
press
petition
for
the
show
recall
but
as
they
neared
the
hall
behold
there
came
a
stranger
to
them
dressed
as
though
in
flame
an
old
thin
grinning
glitterer
decked
with
green
with
thready
in
his
visage
lean
and
at
his
wrinkled
eyes
a
look
of
mirth
not
common
among
men
who
walk
the
earth
yet
from
his
pocket
poked
a
flute
of
wood
and
little
birds
were
following
him
for
food
sirs
said
king
cole
for
it
was
he
i
know
you
seek
the
mayor
but
you
need
not
so
i
have
this
moment
spoken
with
his
grace
he
grants
the
circus
warrant
to
take
place
within
the
city
should
the
prince
see
fit
to
watch
such
pastime
here
is
his
permit
i
go
this
instant
to
the
prince
to
learn
his
wish
herein
wait
here
till
i
return
they
waited
while
the
old
man
passed
the
sentry
beside
the
door
and
vanished
through
the
entry
they
thought
this
old
man
shining
like
new
spain
must
be
the
prince
lordly
chamberlain
his
cloth
of
gold
so
shone
it
seemed
to
burn
wait
till
he
comes
they
stayed
for
his
return
meanwhile
above
the
prince
stood
still
to
bide
the
nightly
mercy
of
the
eventide
brought
nearer
by
each
hour
that
chimed
and
ceased
his
head
was
weary
with
the
city
feast
but
newly
risen
from
he
stood
alone
as
heavy
as
the
day
foundation
stone
the
room
he
stood
in
was
an
ancient
hall
portraits
of
long
dead
men
were
on
the
wall
from
the
dull
crimson
of
their
robes
there
stared
passionless
eyes
long
dead
that
judged
and
glared
above
them
were
the
oaken
corbels
set
of
angels
reaching
hands
that
never
met
where
in
the
spring
the
swallows
came
to
build
it
was
the
meeting
chamber
of
the
guild
from
where
he
stood
the
prince
could
see
a
yard
paved
with
old
slabs
and
cobbles
cracked
and
scarred
where
weeds
had
pushed
and
tiles
and
broken
glass
had
fallen
and
been
trodden
in
the
grass
a
gutter
dripped
upon
it
from
the
rain
it
puts
a
crown
of
lead
upon
my
brain
to
live
this
life
of
princes
thought
the
prince
to
be
a
king
is
to
be
like
a
quince
bitter
himself
yet
flavour
to
the
rest
to
be
a
cat
among
the
hay
were
best
there
in
the
upper
darkness
of
the
loft
with
green
eyes
bright
purring
soft
hearing
the
rain
without
not
forced
as
i
to
lay
foundation
stones
until
i
die
or
sign
till
my
hand
is
sick
the
man
who
plaits
straw
crowns
upon
a
rick
is
happier
in
his
crown
than
i
the
king
and
yet
this
day
a
very
marvellous
thing
came
by
me
as
i
walked
the
chamber
here
once
in
my
childhood
in
my
seventh
year
i
saw
them
come
and
now
they
have
returned
those
strangers
riding
upon
cars
that
burned
or
seemed
to
burn
with
gold
while
music
thrilled
then
beauty
following
till
my
heart
was
filled
and
life
seemed
peopled
from
eternity
they
brought
down
beauty
and
wisdom
from
the
sky
into
the
streets
those
strangers
i
could
see
beauty
and
wisdom
looking
up
at
me
as
then
in
childhood
as
they
passed
below
men
would
not
let
me
know
them
long
ago
those
strangers
bringing
joy
they
will
not
now
i
am
a
prince
with
gold
about
my
brow
duty
not
joy
is
all
a
prince
share
and
yet
those
strangers
from
i
know
not
where
from
glittering
lands
from
unknown
cities
far
beyond
the
of
the
evening
star
would
give
me
life
which
princedom
can
not
give
they
would
be
revelation
i
should
live
i
may
not
deal
with
wisdom
being
a
king
there
came
a
noise
of
someone
entering
he
turned
his
weary
head
to
see
who
came
it
was
king
cole
arrayed
as
though
in
flame
like
a
white
opal
glowing
from
within
he
entered
there
in
snowy
cramoisin
the
prince
mistook
him
for
a
city
lord
he
turned
to
him
and
waited
for
his
word
sir
said
king
cole
i
come
to
bring
you
news
sir
in
the
weary
life
that
princes
use
there
is
scant
time
for
any
prince
or
king
to
taste
delights
that
artists
have
and
bring
but
here
no
other
duty
calls
and
circus
artists

without
the
walls

see
them

a
rite
that
holds
the
watcher
and
they
know
gay
plays
of
ghosts
and
jokes
of
long
ago
and
beauty
of
bright
speed
their
horses
bring
ridden
barebacked
at
gallop
round
the
ring
by
girls
who
stand
upon
the
racing
team
jugglers
they
have
of
whom
the
children
dream
who
pluck
live
rabbits
from
between
their
lips
and
balance
marbles
on
their
fingertips
will
you
not
see
them
sir
and
then
they
dance
ay
said
the
prince
and
thankful
for
the
chance
so
thankful
that
these
bags
of
gold
shall
buy
leave
for
all
comers
to
be
glad
as
i
and
yet
i
know
not
if
the
court
permits
king
pleasures
must
be
sifted
through
the
wits
or
want
of
wit
of
many
a
courtly
brain
i
get
the
lees
and
chokings
of
the
drain
not
the
bright
rippling
that
i
perish
for
cole
sir
i
will
open
the
forbidden
door
which
opened
they
will
enter
all
in
haste
the
life
of
man
is
stronger
than
good
taste
prince
custom
is
stronger
than
the
life
of
man
cole
custom
is
but
a
way
that
life
began
prince
a
withering
way
that
makes
the
leafage
fall
custom
like
winter
is
the
king
of
all
cole
winter
makes
water
solid
yet
the
spring
that
is
but
flowers
is
a
stronger
thing
custom
the
ass
man
rides
will
plod
for
years
but
laughter
kills
him
and
he
dies
at
tears
one
word
of
love
one
spark
from
beauty
fire
and
custom
is
a
memory
listen
sire
then
at
a
window
looking
on
the
street
he
played
his
flute
like
leaves
or
snowflakes
falling
till
men
and
women
passing
thought
how
sweet
these
notes
are
in
our
hearts
like
flowers
falling
and
then
they
thought
an
unknown
voice
is
calling
like
april
calling
to
the
seed
in
earth
madness
is
quickening
deadness
into
birth
and
then
as
in
the
spring
when
first
men
hear
beyond
the
hedge
the
lambling
cry
coming
across
the
snow
a
note
of
cheer
before
the
tells
that
spring
is
nigh
before
the
first
green
bramble
pushes
shy
and
all
the
blood
leaps
at
the
lambling
notes
the
piping
brought
men
hearts
into
their
throats
till
all
were
stirred
however
old
and
grand
generals
bestarred
old
statesmen
courtiers
prim
whose
lips
kissed
nothing
but
the
monarch
hand
stirred
in
their
courtly
minds
recesses
dim
the
sap
of
life
stirred
in
the
dreary
limb
the
old
eyes
brightened
the
remembering
loves
and
brawls
and
mains
of
cocks
and
through
the
town
the
liquid
piping
gladness
thrilled
on
its
way
rejoicing
all
who
heard
to
thrust
aside
their
dullness
or
their
sadness
and
follow
blithely
as
the
fluting
stirred
they
hurried
to
the
guild
like
horses
spurred
there
in
the
road
they
mustered
to
await
they
knew
not
what
a
dream
a
joy
a
fate
and
man
to
man
in
exaltation
cried
something
has
come
to
make
us
young
again
wisdom
has
come
and
beauty
wisdom
bride
and
youth
like
flowering
april
after
rain
but
still
the
fluting
piped
and
men
were
fain
to
sing
and
ring
the
bells
they
knew
not
why
save
that
their
hearts
were
in
an
ecstasy
then
to
the
balcony
above
them
came
king
cole
the
shining
in
his
robe
of
flame
behind
him
came
the
prince
who
smiled
and
bowed
king
cole
made
silence
then
addressed
the
crowd
friends
fellow
mortals
bearers
of
the
ghost
that
burns
and
breaks
its
lamp
but
is
not
lost
this
day
for
one
brief
hour
a
key
is
given
to
all
however
poor
to
enter
heaven
the
bringers
down
of
beauty
from
the
stars
have
reached
this
city
in
their
golden
cars
they
ask
to
bring
you
beauty
if
you
will
you
do
not
answer
rightly
you
are
still
but
you
will
come
to
watch
the
image
move
of
all
you
dreamed
or
had
the
strength
to
love
come
to
the
ring
the
image
of
the
path
that
this
our
planet
through
the
heaven
hath
behold
man
skill
man
wisdom
man
delight
and
woman
beauty
imaged
to
the
height
come
for
our
rulers
come
and
death
whose
feet
tread
at
the
door
permits
a
minute
sweet
to
each
man
soul
vouchsafes
a
glimpse
a
gleam
a
touch
a
breath
of
his
intensest
dream
now
to
that
glimpse
that
moment
come
with
me
our
rulers
come
o
brother
let
there
be
such
welcome
to
our
prince
as
never
was
let
there
be
flowers
under
foot
not
grass
flowers
and
scented
rushes
and
the
sprays
of
purple
bramble
reddening
into
blaze
let
there
be
bells
rung
backward
till
the
tune
be
as
the
joy
of
all
the
bees
in
june
let
float
your
flags
and
let
your
lanterns
rise
like
fruit
upon
the
trees
in
paradise
in
lights
as
rich
as
rome
road
and
tent
and
let
the
children
come
it
is
their
world
these
beauty
dwellers
bring
then
like
the
song
of
all
the
birds
of
spring
he
played
his
flute
and
all
who
heard
it
cried
strew
flowers
before
our
rulers
to
the
ring
the
courtiers
hurried
for
their
coats
of
pride
the
upturned
faces
in
that
market
wide
glowed
in
the
sunset
to
a
beauty
grave
such
as
the
faces
of
immortals
have
and
work
was
laid
aside
on
desk
and
bench
the
ledger
summed
no
penny
more
from
fingers
the
mechanic
wrench
dropped
to
the
kinking
wheel
chains
on
the
floor
the
farmer
shut
the
hen
roost
at
the
store
the
boys
put
up
the
shutters
and
ran
hooting
wild
with
delight
in
freedom
to
the
fluting
and
now
the
fluting
led
that
gathered
tide
of
men
and
women
forward
through
the
town
and
flowers
seemed
to
fall
from
every
side
white
starry
blossoms
such
as
brooks
bow
down
white
petals
clinging
in
the
hair
and
gown
and
those
who
marched
there
thought
that
starry
flowers
grew
at
their
sides
as
though
the
streets
were
bowers
and
all
in
marching
thought
we
go
to
see
life
not
the
daily
coil
but
as
it
is
lived
in
its
beauty
in
eternity
above
base
aim
beyond
our
miseries
life
that
is
speed
and
colour
and
bright
bliss
and
beauty
seen
and
strained
for
and
possest
even
as
a
star
forever
in
the
breast
the
fluting
led
them
through
the
western
gate
from
many
a
tossing
torch
their
faces
glowed
and
and
elate
they
sang
and
scattered
flowers
upon
the
road
still
in
their
hair
the
starry
blossoms
snowed
they
saw
ahead
the
tent
their
mark
lit
now
and
busy
in
the
gathering
dark
there
at
the
vans
and
in
the
tent
the
circus
artists
growled
their
discontent
close
to
the
gate
a
lighted
van
there
was
the
showman
wife
thrust
back
its
window
glass
and
leaned
her
head
without
to
see
who
came
to
buy
a
ticket
for
the
evening
game
a
roll
of
tickets
and
a
plate
of
pence
for
change
lay
by
her
as
she
leaned
from
thence
she
heard
the
crowd
afar
but
in
her
thought
she
said
that
in
the
city
it
is
nought
they
glorify
the
queen
though
sick
at
heart
she
wore
her
spangles
for
her
evening
part
to
dance
upon
the
barebacked
horse
and
sing
green
velvet
was
her
dress
with
tinselling
her
sad
worn
face
had
all
the
nobleness
that
lovely
spirits
gather
from
distress
no
one
she
thought
no
one
within
the
tent
a
flare
gave
blowing
light
there
in
their
scarlet
cart
the
bandsmen
tuned
bugles
that
whinnied
flageolets
that
crooned
and
strings
that
whined
and
grunted
near
the
band
piebald
and
magpie
horses
stood
at
hand
nosing
at
grass
beneath
the
dome
while
men
caressed
them
with
the
the
clowns
with
whited
raddled
faces
heaped
old
horse
cloths
round
them
to
the
chins
they
peeped
above
the
rugs
their
cigarette
ends
light
showing
black
eyes
and
scarlet
smears
and
white
they
watched
the
empty
benches
and
the
wry
green
curtain
door
which
no
one
entered
by
two
little
children
entered
and
sat
still
with
bright
eyes
that
stared
their
fill
and
red
lips
round
in
wonder
smeared
with
tints
from
hands
and
handkerchiefs
and
peppermints
a
farm
lad
entered
that
was
all
the
house
strike
up
the
band
to
give
the
folk
a
rouse
the
showman
said
they
must
be
all
outside
he
said
it
boldly
though
he
knew
he
lied
sad
as
a
funeral
march
for
pleasure
gone
the
band
lamented
out
he
got
them
on
then
paused
as
usual
for
the
crowd
to
come
nobody
came
though
from
without
a
hum
of
instruments
and
singing
slowly
rose
free
feast
with
fireworks
and
public
shows
the
bandsmen
growled
an
empty
house
again
two
children
and
a
ploughboy
and
the
rain
and
then
a
night
march
through
the
mud
they
said
now
to
the
gate
king
cole
his
piping
played
the
showman
wife
from
out
her
window
peering
saw
in
the
road
a
crowd
with
lanterns
nearing
and
just
below
her
perch
a
man
who
shone
as
though
white
flame
were
his
caparison
one
upon
whom
the
tense
settled
with
feathery
feet
and
quivering
sense
till
the
white
gleaming
robe
seemed
stuck
with
eyes
it
was
the
grinning
glitterer
white

said

in
their
princely
hope
that

send
you
these
plump
bags
of
minted
gold
he
gave
a
sack
that
she
could
scarcely
hold
she
dropped
it
trembling
muttering
thanks
and
then
she
cried
o

out

and
then
came
bearers
in
white
with
cressets
full
of
flame
whose
red
tongues
made
the
shadows
dance
like
devils
then
the
blithe
flutes
that
pipe
men
to
the
revels
thrilled
to
the
marrow
softly
as
men
marched
then
tossing
from

arched
the
horses
of

stept
then
with
a
glitter
of
bright
steel
there
swept
the
guard
of
knights

bold
girt
in
a
crimson
cloak
with
spangs
of

came
the
sword

the
four
long
silver
trumpets
thrilling
to

came
the
crowd
like
the
wave
that
closes
up
the

in

majesties
would
tread
the

done
the
seven
piebald
horses
kneeled
like

the
bandsmen
blew
their
best
while
red
as

the
showman
bowed
his

to

the

shepherds
half
dumb
from

on
the

with
their

from

and
in
the

two
rows
of

said
his

the
stranger
in
the
ring
there
in
the
ring
indeed
the
stranger
stood
king
cole
the
shining
with
his
flute
of
wood
waiting
until
the
chattering
court
was
stilled
then
from
his
wooden
flute
his
piping
thrilled
then
all
was
tense
and
then
the
leaping
fluting
clamoured
as
flowering
clamours
for
the
fruiting
and
round
the
ring
came
dodo
the
brown
mare
pied
like
a
her
bright

tare
the
scattered
petals
while
the
clown
came
after
like
life
a
beauty
chased
by
tragic
laughter

then
at
the
end
the
showman
and
his
wife
stood
at
the
entrance
listening
to
the
cheers
they
were
both
happy
to
the
brink
of
tears
king
cole
came
close
and
whispered
in
their
ears

the
showman

ours
now
a
bright
herald
trod
across
the
flowers
to
bid
the
artists
to
the
queen
and
king
who
thanked
them
for
the
joyful
evening
and
shook
each

of
praise

the
green
to
tell
the
showman
that
a
feast
was
laid
a
supper
for
the

quarrels
were
forgotten
and
forgiven
old
friendships
were
restored
and
sinners
shriven
we
find
we
can
not
part
from
will
they
said
and
while
they
talked
the
juggler
took
the
maid
molly
the
singer
to
the
hawthorn
glade
behind
the
tent
and
told
his
love
a
wild
delight
beyond
her
hope
enough
beyond
her
dream
to
brim
her
eyes
with
tears
now
came
a
ringing
cry
to
march
and
cheers
rose
from
the
crowd
the
bright
procession
fared
back
to
the
city
while
the
trumpets
blared
so
the
night
ended
and
the
court
retired
back
to
the
town
the
swaying
torches
reeked
within
the
tent
the
lights
expired
the
dew
dript
from
the
canvas
where
it
leaked
dark
in
the
showman
van
a
cricket
creaked
but
near
the
waggons
fire
was
glowing
red
on
happy
faces
where
the
feast
was
spread
gladly
they
supped
those
artists
of
the
show
then
by
the
perfect
moon
together
timed
they
struck
the
tent
and
laid
it
low
even
as
the
quarter
before
midnight
chimed
then
the
piebald
nags
they
climbed
into
their
vans
and
slowly
stole
away
along
blown
hilcote
on
the
icknield
way
and
as
the
rumbling
of
the
waggons
died
by
aston
tirrold
and
the
moretons
twain
with
in
the
countryside
lit
by
the
moon
and
fragrant
from
the
rain
king
cole
moved
softly
in
the
ring
again
where
now
the
owls
and
he
were
left
alone
the
night
was
loud
with
water
upon
stone
he
watched
the
night
then
taking
up
his
flute
he
breathed
a
piping
of
this
life
of
ours
the
prize
the
difficult
pursuit
the
passionate
lusts
that
shut
us
in
their
towers
the
love
that
helps
us
on
the
fear
that
lowers
the
pride
that
makes
us
and
the
pride
that
mars
the
beauty
and
the
truth
that
are
our
stars
and
man
the
marvellous
thing
that
in
the
dark
works
with
his
little
strength
to
make
a
light
his
wit
that
strikes
his
hope
that
tends
a
spark
his
sorrow
of
soul
in
toil
that
brings
delight
his
friends
who
make
salt
sweet
and
blackness
bright
his
birth
and
growth
and
change
and
death
the
wise
his
peace
that
puts
a
hand
upon
his
eyes
all
these
his
pipings
breathed
of
until
twelve
struck
on
the
belfry
tower
with
tremblings
numb
such
as
will
shudder
in
the
axe
helve
when
the
head
strikes
to
tell
his
hour
was
come
out
of
the
living
world
of
christendom
he
dimmed
like
mist
till
one
could
scarcely
note
the
robins
nestling
to
his
old
grey
coat
dimmer
he
grew
yet
still
a
glimmering
stayed
like
light
on
cobwebs
but
it
dimmed
and
died
then
there
was
naught
but
moonlight
in
the
glade
moonlight
and
water
and
an
owl
that
cried
far
overhead
a
rush
of
birds
wings
sighed
from
migrants
going
south
until
the
spring
the
night
seemed
fanned
by
an
immortal
wing
but
where
the
juggler
trudged
beside
his
love
each
felt
a
touching
from
beyond
our
ken
from
that
bright
kingdom
where
the
souls
who
strove
live
now
forever
helping
living
men
and
as
they
kissed
each
other
even
then
their
brows
seemed
blessed
as
though
a
hand
unseen
had
crowned
their
loves
with
green
illustration
