after
scene
i
wife
and
the
mother
the
wife
love
it
is
dark
among
your
roses
the
face
of
the
moon
is
turned
away
the
nightingale
is
silent
and
lonely
lean
from
your
window
a
little
way
lean
but
a
little
way
towards
me
out
of
the
window
where
jasmines
twine
open
the
lattice
softly
slowly
till
the
light
of
your
eyes
shall
gladden
mine
love
it
is
dark
among
your
roses
and
how
since
the
nightingales
are
fled
can
i
tell
your
heart
how
my
heart
is
lowly
to
touch
the
ground
where
your
sandals
tread
this
is
your
garden
these
your
flowers
these
stars
have
seen
you
these
dews
have
known
and
now
your
eyes
and
your
smile
you
give
me
give
me
your
love
and
be
all
mine
own
the
mother
sing
that
again
the
music
soothes
my
ear
the
wife
my
husband
made
it
for
me
ere
we
wed
and
sang
it
in
my
garden
i
arose
and
leaned
down
to
him
and
my
fingers
gave
to
all
his
kisses
ah
those
days
were
sweet
the
mother
not
sweet
now
the
wife
i
am
happy
in
his
love
and
thank
god
for
it
nay
propitiate
with
vows
and
offering
i
fear
a
wrath
called
down
on
too
great
happiness
i
fear
i
know
not
what
oh
i
possess
a
gift
so
rare
and
precious
that
like
men
who
go
laden
with
rubies
i
am
grown
suspect
of
all
the
earth
and
heaven
feel
the
stars
peer
covetously
on
me
every
hour
that
he
is
from
my
side
a
cloud
of
woe
settles
upon
me
like
a
swarm
of
bees
ah
is
it
possible
that
we
can
sin
in
happiness
against
a
jealous
god
the
mother
nay
nay
these
foolish
thoughts
your
wits
are
strayed
with
too
much
brooding
let
me
bind
afresh
the
knot
of
scarlet
lilies
in
your
hair
they
fade
already
for
the
sun
is
high
towards
the
noon
ah
child
what
waits
for
you
but
love
and
yet
more
love
and
happiness
and
children
of
delight
and
in
old
age
respect
of
all
the
peoples
and
at
last
death
in
his
arms
and
burial
in
peace
still
do
you
tremble
what
is
it
you
fear
the
wife
can
you
not
feel
a
something
in
the
air
a
warning
or
a
presence
or
the
weight
of
some
horror
that
like
dust
impalpable
and
deadly
clings
and
kills
there
is
some
terror
is
my
heart
that
speaks
and
warns
me
ah
would
god
indeed
your
son
my
love
and
husband
had
another
father
than
that
celestial
being
this
it
is
that
puts
eternal
sadness
on
his
brow
and
shade
within
his
eyes
i
can
not
lift
even
with
kisses
is
the
angel
nature
that
makes
him
sit
in
a
trance
chin
in
his
hand
and
eyes
on
vacancy
and
lips
all
bare
of
love
the
while
his
soul
struggles
against
the
bonds
of
finity
the
mother
ah
how
you
love
him
the
wife
more
because
of
it
this
kingdom
infinite
i
can
not
know
though
loving
him
the
mother
alas
so
did
i
love
the
wife
tell
me
of
love
the
mother
belovéd
what
should
i
tell
that
his
lips
have
not
taught
you
the
wife
tell
of
yours
so
that
i
may
compare
your
flowers
with
mine
your
doubts
and
times
of
joy
and
how
arose
the
sudden
and
sweet
passion
in
your
heart
did
the
world
burst
forth
like
a
flower
from
bud
all
suddenly
in
beauty
when
you
met
the
mother
ah
how
your
words
have
wakened
memory
and
like
love
itself
it
is
the
wife
the
first
time
that
you
met
the
mother
ah
that
first
time
it
was
a
night
of
gods
a
night
of
love
the
earth
was
still
beneath
a
summer
sky
so
thickly
sown
with
stars
that
it
appeared
a
vase
of
ebon
in
a
silver
shroud
no
breath
there
stirred
the
hot
air
seemed
to
hang
in
heavy
folds
like
silken
tapestry
clinging
caressing
all
the
birds
were
still
no
nightingale
with
her
ecstatic
pain
transfixed
the
silence
earth
was
dead
asleep
sunk
in
a
scented
languor
every
flower
steamed
all
its
odour
forth
as
it
would
pour
its
soul
before
the
mystery
of
love
and
i
into
the
night
had
stolen
forth
oppressed
with
pain
or
joy
i
knew
not
which
knew
only
that
the
blood
throughout
my
veins
did
run
like
liquid
fire
head
to
foot
i
tingled
with
sensation
all
my
hair
stirred
as
with
separate
life
within
itself
and
as
i
plucked
the
flowers
and
wove
them
in
purple
and
waxen
languorously
sweet
they
seemed
anticipation
of
a
touch
should
make
each
thread
of
hair
become
a
bird
fluttering
with
outstretched
wings
from
off
my
breast
i
flung
my
garment
back
the
soft
air
wooed
like
sleepy
lips
ere
love
is
yet
awake
then
as
i
lingered
in
the
dusky
depths
all
blacker
than
the
night
blacker
than
shadows
cast
by
palace
walls
upon
a
moonlit
night
there
in
that
web
of
darkness
suddenly
there
came
the
wonder
unto
me
the
god
my
love
within
mine
ears
there
was
a
silver
silence
and
in
my
heart
a
golden
burst
of
song
the
darkness
burned
around
me
with
a
light
born
from
the
other
worlds
and
there
he
stood
radiant
godlike
purple
were
his
wings
and
splashed
with
fire
his
hair
and
crowned
with
stars
for
flowers
in
his
eyes
my
soul
sank
into
passion
and
was
drowned
chorus
oh
what
a
pair
of
birds
hidden
among
the
leaves
he
a
god
and
she
a
maid
deathless
lips
on
mortal
laid
nothing
death
retrieves
there
a
son
of
god
and
child
of
mortal
seed
met
and
kissed
as
love
with
love
oh
the
leaves
were
thick
above
no
stars
saw
the
deed
no
stars
but
the
eye
of
god
ah
perchance
he
saw
how
a
god
to
mortal
prayed
and
the
fatal
compact
made
eternal
law
veiled
and
still
the
night
so
a
fount
of
tears
springs
at
first
unseen
unguessed
till
at
last
the
flood
confessed
gushes
down
the
years
son
of
a
son
of
god
and
the
daughter
of
men
too
frail
union
of
the
nature
twain
only
sorrow
and
want
and
pain
striving
without
avail
desire
for
wings
of
a
god
tied
to
the
will
of
a
man
memory
of
a
boundless
space
where
stars
and
spheres
their
dance
enlace
with
the
threescore
human
span
hung
like
a
bridge
in
the
gulf
of
god
eternity
oh
a
mind
to
know
and
a
heart
to
crave
beyond
the
horizon
of
the
grave
to
the
bounds
of
infinity
yet
ever
fate
compels
this
infinite
desire
to
match
with
cramped
and
finite
brain
and
all
of
heaven
earth
may
gain
is
smoke
where
should
be
fire
scene
ii
the
seeker
the
air
is
heavy
all
the
winds
are
still
so
that
my
own
breath
hangs
about
my
head
like
incense
an
altar
now
the
earth
lies
in
a
swoon
and
all
the
flowers
droop
weighting
their
stems
ranged
in
their
brazen
pots
without
the
house
the
very
petals
lie
like
languid
limbs
relaxed
this
crimson
rose
looks
as
if
almost
to
my
sense
smells
of
the
same
the
lilies
are
like
death
there
is
a
taint
of
sickness
in
the
air
through
all
the
noonday
light
like
fever
chill
in
fever
burning
and
the
sky
is
brass
the
very
tinkle
of
the
fountain
spray
is
dead
and
tuneless
even
the
fresh
springs
have
lost
their
freshness
run
from
off
my
hands
in
drops
of
lead
and
all
my
spirit
seems
weighed
and
confined
with
fetters
of
decay
because
i
have
loved
beauty
more
than
most
and
striven
to
pluck
out
the
heart
of
it
because
i
have
such
sense
of
lovely
things
that
i
can
pour
my
soul
in
thankfulness
before
a
leaf
god
makes
to
grow
aright
a
unit
of
perfection
is
ordained
because
i
love
most
still
i
most
must
lack
love
satisfaction
quietude
of
soul
still
must
i
find
such
void
disparity
between
the
false
and
true
and
yet
they
grow
together
intermingled
true
is
false
itself
by
sometime
seeming
who
shall
find
the
point
where
false
and
true
are
reconciled
the
very
flower
that
we
stoop
to
smell
grows
from
a
dunghill
look
but
in
its
roots
and
what
obscene
and
hideous
blind
life
goes
teeming
sickened
then
we
shrink
aback
from
rose
velvet
petals
so
the
soul
holds
best
and
meanest
in
a
common
cup
yet
must
there
be
a
law
in
things
that
are
seemingly
lawless
purify
the
sight
and
truth
must
surely
then
be
visible
disparity
made
clear
the
eye
of
god
sees
good
in
everything
thereto
i
strive
to
see
with
god
own
vision
be
more
clear
in
speech
than
god
to
asking
human
hearts
then
is
the
tangle
straightened
and
the
world
lies
in
perspective
as
before
me
lie
traced
through
the
shimmering
heat
the
palaces
towers
and
temples
gardens
and
granaries
of
this
fair
city
melting
far
away
into
the
hills
at
last
yet
must
i
sit
here
for
a
little
while
where
many
columns
make
a
heavy
gloom
and
with
the
trickle
from
the
of
unfresh
water
cheat
myself
awhile
with
thought
of
evening
freshness
oh
my
soul
is
wearier
than
my
body
with
the
toil
it
aches
with
length
of
watching
i
have
strained
my
spiritual
eyes
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
dawn
and
nothing
seen
but
blackness
let
me
rest
as
rest
the
quiet
dead
from
doubt
and
toil
like
silver
feathers
from
the
wings
of
god
sleep
fans
my
senses
the
chorus
sleep
and
forget
forget
the
aching
toil
the
disappointments
and
the
long
delays
the
watches
of
the
and
the
morn
the
lonely
hours
unrewarded
days
sleep
and
forget
in
death
we
all
are
equal
great
and
small
brought
to
the
common
level
of
the
dust
there
is
no
glory
that
survives
the
years
nay
nay
alike
we
shall
be
as
we
must
sleep
and
forget
in
sleep
we
are
omnipotent
as
gods
beyond
our
furthest
wish
we
can
attain
unfettered
by
the
chain
of
circumstance
sleep
then
or
waking
turn
and
pray
again
a
little
more
to
sleep
and
to
forget
scene
iii
mother
wife
the
mother
ah
me
your
fears
have
settled
on
my
heart
i
fear
the
very
day
there
is
a
strange
portentous
look
all
the
earth
my
hand
stretched
in
the
sunlight
seems
to
throw
no
shade
as
if
the
natural
laws
had
all
stood
still
i
breathe
as
in
a
nightmare
breath
oppressed
i
start
at
every
sound
but
fear
no
sound
so
much
as
stillness
which
descends
on
us
like
a
great
mantle
choking
out
our
hearts
the
wife
give
me
your
hand
what
is
it
makes
you
fear
and
shiver
like
plane
trees
before
the
rain
the
mother
as
i
lay
in
the
shadow
of
the
court
during
the
noonday
fierceness
watched
the
rays
chequered
between
the
lattice
window
work
and
listened
to
the
fountain
in
the
grove
of
orange
trees
go
singing
to
itself
behold
all
suddenly
before
me
stood
my
the
angel
ever
dear
and
radiant
as
that
first
night
years
ago
there
stood
he
where
the
marble
touched
his
feet
it
glowed
translucent
like
a
sunlit
gem
the
perfume
of
his
hair
had
made
me
swoon
had
not
his
eyes
compelled
me
grave
he
looked
where
gravity
in
such
a
beauteous
thing
could
find
occasion
and
his
voice
was
low
and
troubled
warning
me
let
not
your
son
tempt
god
too
far
he
will
not
brook
affront
though
son
of
mine
should
dare
it
be
assured
the
secret
of
this
riddle
universe
shall
be
known
on
earth
man
was
not
made
for
too
much
knowledge
mankind
ceases
then
when
man
too
much
aspires
speak
to
him
lest
he
should
bring
destruction
on
your
head
and
on
the
world
thus
spoke
he
nothing
more
and
ere
my
eyes
could
hold
him
he
was
gone
the
wife
ah
let
us
go
in
to
my
husband
then
and
warn
him
quickly
the
mother
i
have
warned
alas
and
he
has
heard
with
the
unheeding
smile
one
gives
to
children
prattle
now
at
last
the
hours
bear
fruit
and
shall
i
hold
my
hand
he
answered
for
your
vision
i
have
waited
now
is
the
time
when
hope
is
justified
truth
dawns
not
even
god
himself
can
stand
between
the
light
and
me
and
shadow
it
the
wife
ah
god
ah
god
to
whom
shall
be
appeal
the
mother
look
where
he
comes
the
wife
with
what
an
air
fulfilled
seeker
after
truth
the
seeker
now
do
i
stand
upon
the
very
brink
of
my
desire
as
a
soul
released
and
purified
by
passing
through
the
rays
of
white
eternity
i
view
the
world
now
am
i
all
at
peace
the
heart
that
yearns
in
bitter
loneliness
through
midnight
hours
yet
can
not
voice
its
longing
brain
that
weaves
its
subtle
web
around
the
central
thought
yet
never
can
absorb
it
and
this
form
the
visible
pride
of
body
all
complete
are
one
in
union
the
body
knows
its
uses
and
its
worths
and
has
no
fear
the
heart
no
more
is
empty
i
have
found
eternal
love
to
fill
it
and
no
more
gropes
the
blind
brain
for
the
great
definite
away
from
me
my
people
lest
the
sight
of
loving
faces
blunt
the
senses
keen
hovering
on
the
pain
of
a
new
birth
the
mother
my
son
my
son
it
is
not
well
to
tempt
the
thunders
of
jehovah
he
who
placed
man
on
this
earth
and
gave
him
such
a
form
and
such
a
nature
never
did
intend
the
form
or
nature
to
be
changed
the
seeker
enough
is
it
not
parcel
of
the
nobleness
of
his
conception
thus
to
place
us
here
low
in
the
scale
that
we
by
effort
worth
may
reach
to
him
and
equal
him
at
last
the
mother
oh
man
was
born
for
failure
not
success
to
strive
and
strive
and
evermore
to
fail
and
failing
still
strive
ever
therein
lies
the
nobleness
that
equals
him
to
god
though
linked
to
insufficient
means
for
god
why
will
you
hope
to
change
appointed
fate
while
still
in
man
the
sad
dwells
godhead
and
manhood
still
as
dark
and
light
the
eternal
war
goes
on
it
is
our
lot
accept
it
spare
us
last
catastrophe
the
wife
alas
alas
you
see
he
marks
you
not
his
eyes
are
fixed
on
distance
and
his
lips
move
to
the
cadence
of
a
song
or
prayer
i
know
not
which
and
ever
and
anon
his
forehead
vivid
with
the
teeming
brain
rests
in
his
hollow
hand
he
marks
you
not
no
more
than
raindrops
plashing
on
a
roof
whereto
perhaps
one
listens
for
a
space
and
says
it
raineth
then
again
to
sleep
the
mother
speak
you
to
him
if
he
may
hear
his
wife
the
wife
ah
me
my
lord
what
is
it
i
can
say
that
will
excuse
the
saying
words
are
few
when
hearts
are
fullest
on
my
wedding
night
do
you
remember
you
did
take
my
hand
as
i
take
yours
now
lay
your
lips
on
it
see
here
i
lay
my
lips
and
all
the
love
your
heart
would
fain
express
and
tongue
could
not
i
read
in
eyes
and
kisses
being
well
skilled
in
love
translation
the
seeker
who
is
this
that
speaks
your
words
come
through
my
musing
like
the
call
of
quails
across
the
desert
troubling
me
with
a
strange
stirring
of
the
peaceful
heart
the
wife
it
was
my
soul
and
not
my
words
that
called
the
seeker
my
hand
is
wet
with
tears
the
wife
they
are
my
prayers
the
seeker
why
do
you
weep
when
all
the
world
should
be
poised
on
the
outspread
wings
of
happiness
ah
just
a
little
moment
loose
your
hold
while
strips
my
soul
for
last
and
fiercest
struggle
that
gives
us
victory
the
wife
nay
cease
ah
cease
why
must
you
venture
to
the
wrath
of
god
for
a
mere
idle
fancy
is
not
love
my
love
and
youth
and
joy
enough
for
you
roses
are
beautiful
to
bind
one
brow
why
must
one
grasp
at
stars
ah
if
my
tears
barren
as
dew
that
falls
upon
the
sand
can
not
incline
you
to
forgetfulness
of
all
save
love
you
are
inexorable
you
love
me
not
the
seeker
i
make
an
end
of
tears
the
wife
nay
rather
tears
enough
to
drown
the
world
the
mother
again
he
lapses
in
his
trance
the
wife
ah
me
i
can
no
more
we
wait
on
god
event
the
seeker
there
have
been
summer
nights
so
exquisite
the
soul
in
me
did
pant
with
pain
and
with
its
efforts
vain
to
grasp
the
beauty
of
the
infinite
when
my
senses
and
the
silent
stars
the
world
of
forms
was
purged
away
and
all
creation
lay
intense
eternal
without
bounds
or
bars
and
all
my
yearning
soul
reached
up
to
strove
for
failed
to
grasp
that
whole
ye
who
have
felt
the
ache
of
visible
beauty
burning
through
your
brain
and
vainly
tried
to
break
through
forms
of
beauty
beauty
to
attain
ye
who
have
felt
the
weight
of
much
desire
in
a
little
space
god
in
your
narrow
brain
and
in
the
face
of
mortals
the
large
lineaments
of
fate
ye
who
have
felt
the
pang
even
in
love
most
full
communion
of
the
soul
loneliness
which
may
not
hang
for
all
its
love
another
soul
upon

draw
near
to
me
now
ye
who
long
above
the
common
things
for
truth
approaches
us
on
flaming
wings
and
all
life
tangle
shall
be
straightened
now
and
right
shall
rise
triumphant
over
wrong
and
nought
be
great
or
little
weak
or
strong
but
all
creation

flashing
upon
us
from
the
angry
skies
ah
woe
this
is
destruction

let
it
be

where
it
has

in
sleep
my

about
his

at

chorus
alas
alas
alas
the

are
torn

in
terror
rending

wildly
earth
is
blind
and

and
earth
by
you

your
cry
to

oh
a
union
of
destruction
sons
of

seed
of
evil
nurtured
for
the
hungry
waters

there

now
oh
beseeching
raise
for

impotent
hands
while
the
frenzied
winds
are
roaring
loosened
from
their
bands
and
the
waters
tumult
reaching
to
the
stars
where
quiet
stands
god
contemplative
destruction
is
the
uttermost
destruction
he
demands
now
the

are
uprising
and
the

bend
headlong
all

descend
all
in

alas
alas
alas

consuming
roll
sonnets
to
we
touched
the
borderland
of
death
and
life
and
come
back
to
the
primroses
again
and
see
with
different
eyes
the
slanting
rain
buffet
the
larches
in
a
strife
with
different
eyes
for
we
have
looked
on
death
and
know
what
life
is
for
we
felt
the
hand
of
that
sad
lady
of
the
other
land
and
now
with
her
released
we
draw
our
breath
life
is
for
gladness
not
for
mulish
days
between
the
galling
shafts
of
commonplace
see
now
the
willow
tassels
all
ablaze
against
the
background
of
the
windy
blue
and
in
the
dusk
the
crocus
glimmers
through
the
footsteps
of
persephone
we
trace
to
andrew
chatto
it
is
your
thin
ungracious
wine
that
runs
within
a
year
of
bottling
to
your
tongue
the
noblest
wine
is
somewhat
harsh
when
young
lay
it
aside
for
many
moons
and
suns
send
it
if
so
you
will
its
with
the
ocean
storm
and
strife
then
open
it
when
ripe
are
wine
and
life
and
see
what
mellow
sunshine
you
have
there
here
is
another
year
to
crown
that
head
so
full
of
years
and
honour
dear
old
friend
whose
wisdom
makes
a
constant
quiet
balm
for
tricks
and
trials
of
life
whose
age
doth
blend
with
philosophic
calm
and
sunshine
on
this
generation
shed
november
there
is
a
gleam
of
sunshine
on
the
earth
after
so
many
weary
days
of
rain
a
break
of
yellowing
clouds
which
offers
plain
the
sun
veiled
disc
a
very
but
still
the
sun
with
sun
november
worth
the
sky
is
of
a
turner
lived
again
such
colours
through
the
misty
greyness
gain
they
almost
seem
to
touch
with
spring
the
earth
how
should
we
not
be
glad
when
this
one
day
out
of
the
saddest
of
all
months
appears
suddenly
beautiful
a
single
ray
of
sunlight
strikes
through
cloud
and
clears
the
whole
drear
countryside
of
grey
so
may
one
word
dispel
a
cloud
of
tears
to
a
robin
in
december
in
paradise
there
is
no
sweeter
song
than
that
thin
music
that
the
robin
makes
on
short
december
afternoons
and
takes
the
winter
woods
with
utterance
frail
yet
strong
till
all
the
barren
fields
and
ruined
brakes
the
flowerless
gardens
and
the
hedges
bare
dream
of
the
spring
and
all
the
rainy
air
seems
soft
and
mellow
as
the
summer
lakes
more
precious
than
the
treasures
of
the
east
guarded
by
antelope
or
all
the
nightingales
that
haunt
the
grove
of
persian
gardens
silver
pipe
of
hope
that
nature
gives
us
when
her
gifts
are
least
sing
to
our
hearts
oh
little
voice
of
love
a
january
morning
how
strangely
shone
the
crescent
of
the
moon
in
the
grey
twilight
dawning
the
sea
a
star
that
seemed
of
stars
a
memory
as
faint
as
lilies
on
a
sultry
noon
ebbed
in
the
chilly
waxing
of
the
morn
the
sea
was
rest
in
motion
hardly
stirred
its
waves
upon
the
beach
there
was
no
bird
to
break
its
undersong
of
silence
born
the
misty
shadows
lay
upon
the
trees
whose
colour
was
but
echo
of
the
tone
that
earth
and
sky
were
wrapped
in
harmonies
of
wedded
hue
were
visible
alone
and
over
all
a
breath
of
memory
blown
of
other
dawnings
upon
other
seas
february
can
there
be
aught
to
touch
the
sleeping
dead
to
consciousness
can
love
still
call
to
love
across
that
dark
abyss
can
feeling
move
dead
heart
and
brain
that
once
with
blood
were
fed
to
stir
and
quicken
in
their
narrow
bed
for
that
which
yet
is
living
we
believe
such
force
has
love
that
it
may
still
retrieve
its
heart
eurydice
among
the
dead
i
shall
awake
then
shall
awake
my
soul
not
when
full
summer
beautifies
the
earth
but
with
the
first
sweet
stirring
of
the
sap
ere
yet
the
fields
are
green
or
leaves
unroll
i
shall
but
sleep
awhile
in
nature
lap
to
be
reborn
with
february
rebirth
to
april
i
is
not
alone
the
loveliness
of
spring
that
makes
spring
lovely
there
a
sense
behind
of
wonders
deeper
than
the
eye
can
find
in
daffodils
or
swallows
on
the
wing
a
subtler
pleasure
than
the
sense
can
bind
when
on
the
dusty
roads
the
sing
as
march
turns
april
and
the
hours
bring
songs
to
deaf
ears
and
beauty
to
the
blind
april
is
secret
nature
treasure
room
which
she
unlocks
to
us
who
love
her
well
in
magic
moments
then
indeed
we
see
the
wonder
of
all
from
the
gloom
of
long
ere
adam
fell
and
all
the
beauty
of
all
springs
to
be
to
april
ii
there
will
be
other
days
as
fair
as
these
which
i
shall
never
see
for
other
eyes
the
lyric
loveliness
of
cherry
trees
shall
bloom
against
the
windy
skies
and
i
not
praise
them
where
upon
the
stream
the
faëry
tracery
of
willows
lies
i
shall
not
see
the
sunlight
flying
gleam
nor
watch
the
swallows
sudden
dip
and
rise
most
mutable
the
forms
of
beauty
are
yet
beauty
most
eternal
and
unchanged
perfect
for
us
and
for
posterity
still
perfect
yearly
is
the
pageant
ranged
and
dare
we
wish
that
our
poor
dust
should
mar
the
wonder
of
such
immortality
to
daniel
manin
if
that
most
noble
soul
which
here
on
earth
was
known
as
manin
yet
have
consciousness
of
what
is
and
what
is
not
being
not
less
than
here
he
was
in
courage
and
in
worth
seeing
the
world
whereon
we
sweat
and
strive
shall
he
not
know
his
italy
and
bless
and
in
his
own
heart
praise
the
steadfastness
that
held
him
to
his
purpose
when
alive
shall
he
not
have
reward
for
all
his
pain
who
dying
with
his
incompleted
aim
saw
failure
only
and
the
bitter
toll
of
loved
ones
lost
and
lost
it
seemed
in
vain
must
not
that
heart
still
keep
his
country
name
though
him
all
death

heave
and
roll
to
the

on
that
voice
which
sounded
first
the
ringing
clarion

of
freedom
and
the
ears
of
mankind
smote
with
that
brave
speech
whose
hearing
does

thou
now
dost
hide
thy
titan
self
in
a
drab
clothing
lies
whilst
false
and
shrill
thy
people
squabble
for
the
dirty
pelf
of

hustings
while
they
fill
our
streets

throughout

goes
thy

bethink
you

how
will
history
place
your
name
beside
her
others
if
you
fight
with
weapons
oh
be
bold
to
face
the
conflict
tell
the
truth
as
in
your
sight
it
does
appear
with
nothing
false
or

the
nation
heart
will
know
to
choose
aright
be
brave
be
true
these
days
will
you
forget
you
are
our
leaders
we
a
people
yet
consolation
is
there
a
pain
to
match
my
pain
in
all
this
world
of
woe
when
to
and
fro
on
a
barren
earth
my
weary
footsteps
go
when
no
day
sun
shall
give
me
mirth
and
no
stars
blessed
be
because
my
heart
goes
hungry
and
lone
for
one
who
turns
from
me
hear
what
the
voice
of
all
sorrows
saith
from
out
the
ages
dim
as
melt
the
snows
your
passion
goes
and
as
dew
it
vanisheth
take
up
take
up
your
burden
of
woe
unblenching
on
your
journey
go
for
man
was
born
to
reap
and
sow
that
earth
might
fruitful
be
is
there
a
pain
to
match
my
pain
who
watch
the
small
dead
face
with
the
folded
lips
and
the
folded
lids
and
the
cheek
the
dimples
grace
where
they
will
come
no
more
no
more
oh
small
soft
hands
that
hold
so
quietly
in
rosy
palms
my
heart
that
dead
and
cold
hear
what
the
voice
of
all
sorrows
saith
though
still
the
little
feet
though
the
hands
are
chill
and
the
sweet
form
chill
and
gone
the
childish
breath
take
up
take
up
your
burden
of
woe
for
you
were
born
to
sorrow
so
to
bear
in
anguish
and
lose
in
pain
that
earth
might
be
fulfilled
is
there
a
pain
to
match
my
pain
who
loved
all
men
on
earth
who
saw
the
godhead
through
the
shell
that
burdened
them
at
birth
who
strove
for
right
who
strove
for
good
since
love
must
win
at
last
this
hour
they
lead
me
out
to
die
with
cords
they
make
me
fast
hear
what
the
voice
of
all
sorrows
saith
they
lead
you
out
to
die
for
the
love
you
gave
they
will
dig
your
grave
and
their
thanks
to
you
is
death
take
up
take
up
your
burden
of
woe
and
proudly
to
your
scaffold
go
for
men
were
born
to
suffer
so
that
mankind
might
be
great
tapestry
god
the
omnipotent
wearied
of
space
and
the
void
of
endless
blue
and
the
light
of
eternity
in
his
face
and
eternity
emptiness
round
the
place
that
the
presence
of
godhead
knew
so
he
wove
him
a
piece
of
tapestry
all
infinity
drawn
and
out
of
his
brain
and
its
subtlety
were
the
suns
that
stand
and
the
comets
that
flee
and
the
paths
of
the
planets
born
no
plan
too
great
no
design
too
small
for
the
fingers
of
god
the
lord
the
joy
of
invention
lived
through
all
from
the
orbit
curve
of
the
earthly
ball
to
the
shell
where
sound
is
stored
and
all
continued
as
they
were
made
clean
cast
from
perfection
brain
not
a
beam
of
light
from
its
circle
strayed
but
the
whole
the
heavenly
laws
obeyed
god
looked
and
wearied
again
so
he
wove
him
a
piece
of
tapestry
with
fingers
thrice
refined
and
he
mingled
the
threads
with
subtlety
the
threads
of
our
human
destiny
and
the
light
with
the
dark
he
twined
for
shadow
and
shine
were
mingled
there
and
white
was
matched
with
red
and
the
thread
of
the
silver
gleamed
more
fair
for
the
gloom
that
surrounding
made
it
rare
and
god
in
his
wisdom
said
of
my
handiwork
but
the
human
soul
can
suffer
the
laws
of
change
that
only
errs
from
my
set
control
and
takes
in
pleasure
and
pays
in
toll
the
whole
of
its
passion
range
but
who
shall
judge
or
who
condemn
this
work
that
my
hands
have
made
for
the
thread
that
here
appears
a
gem
so
have
i
mingled
and
twisted
them
is
there
the
gleam
of
a
blade
nor
evil
nor
good
exists
for
me
as
i
mingle
strand
with
strand
the
past
is
the
visible
tapestry
the
present
i
weave
and
the
destiny
of
the
future
is
in
my
hand
and
the
past
and
the
future
both
are
met
in
the
present
history
for
the
thread
i
hold
is
unbroken
yet
and
the
thing
i
weave
is
unguessed
at
yet
in
this
human
tapestry
wisdom
and
youth
in
the
depths
of
the
forest
merlin
dreamed
the
shuttle
of
noon
wove
light
and
shade
over
the
moss
and
around
the
trees
and
a
network
among
the
branches
made
he
sat
with
his
back
against
a
tree
grey
as
himself
and
gnarled
and
old
the
lichen
was
grey
as
the
ragged
beard
over
his
friezen
mantle
fold
still
he
sat
like
an
ancient
stone
that
time
has
forgotten
to
wear
away
while
streamed
the
forest
green
and
gold
like
banners
on
a
windy
day
and
merlin
watched
as
watches
a
tree
a
sombre
oak
of
antiquity
the
myriad
life
that
seethes
and
hums
around
its
immobility
around
himself
himself
had
made
a
monstrous
and
a
mystic
spell
weblike
wherein
he
sat
and
dreamed
so
in
its
mesh
may
spider
dwell
his
silence
heard
the
things
that
grow
in
underwood
of
tangled
green
his
vision
penetrated
deep
beneath
the
common
surface
screen
the
roots
of
things
were
plain
to
him
he
saw
the
crowded
where
every
life
fought
ceaselessly
to
bring
a
future
life
to
birth
for
him
the
stirring
of
the
leaves
beneath
a
listless
passing
breeze
spoke
with
a
manifolded
tongue
from
all
the
thickly
growing
trees
for
him
the
beetles
and
the
mice
made
magic
of
desires
and
fears
the
bumble
bee
slow
rhythmic
hum
seemed
like
the
passing
of
the
years
and
where
a
curving
lay
half
in
shade
and
half
in
light
the
universe
giant
curves
were
all
discovered
to
his
sight
all
things
were
all
things
complement
for
what
the
oak
left
unexpressed
in
line
and
hue
the
silver
birch
continued
in
completion
quest
there
was
no
moss
nor
stone
nor
leaf
nor
lingering
small
drop
of
dew
but
he
resolved
to
harmony
and
in
the
mystic
drew
so
sat
he
abstract
as
a
god
the
greatest
wisdom
of
the
world
while
on
his
head
the
sunshine
played
and
round
his
robe
the
shadows
curled
till
through
the
forest
green
and
gold
and
through
the
magic
afternoon
strange
as
moonlit
waters
are
sweet
as
in
june
oh
vivien
came
and
through
the
web
of
dreaming
broke
and
on
her
silver
clarion
note
of
laughter
the
great
sage
awoke
she
sat
her
down
beneath
the
tree
oh
fair
her
youth
his
age
beside
she
plucked
the
boughs
to
make
her
shade
she
pulled
the
flowers
far
and
wide
to
deck
her
hair
and
while
the
glades
to
her
laughter
gay
she
leaned
to
merlin
kissing
him
and
stroked
his
beard
unkempt
and
grey
and
he
forgot
the
voice
of
trees
and
of
the
silent
undergrowth
to
hear
her
merry
lilting
song
and
watch
reposed
in
summer
sloth
vivien
dance
upon
the
sward
as
children
dance
alone
at
ease
till
breathlessly
she
cast
her
down
and
laid
her
head
upon
his
knees
and
with
his
hand
among
her
hair
the
magic
of
his
mind
was
rent
and
captive
to
her
shadowed
eyes
behold
the
went
a
villa
on
the
bay
of
naples
the
crescent
single
line
of
white
above
the
pointed
cypress
tree
was
all
there
was
of
any
light
upon
the
earth
and
on
the
sea
black
was
the
bay
of
naples
and
ah
she
said
why
have
you
come
unbidden
on
my
balcony
this
midnight
hour
close
and
dumb
what
is
it
you
would
have
of
me
here
by
the
bay
of
naples
now
having
knit
untie
the
knot
said
he
you
drew
me
from
afar
or
having
willed
or
willed
it
not
your
face
shone
on
me
like
a
star
above
the
bay
of
naples
oh
know
you
not
fair
star
of
love
the
thought
of
you
is
like
new
wine
or
strong
sweet
air
on
heights
above
for
mortal
senses
too
divine
black
was
the
bay
of
naples
her
lamp
beside
the
window
set
the
woman
and
the
light
shone
out
a
yellow
glimmer
in
the
jet
of
darkness
that
lay
all
about
the
outstretched
bay
of
naples
but
nay
she
said
and
laughed
with
scorn
and
also
with
a
little
pride
my
lover
comes
before
the
morn
and
if
he
find
you
woe
betide
beside
the
bay
of
naples
now
get
you
gone
in
very
deed
while
time
is
yet
for
you
to
go
behold
i
beg
you
at
my
need
how
black
the
chilly
waters
flow
around
the
bay
of
naples
ah
do
you
think
i
am
afraid
said
he
of
man
that
sees
the
light
if
god
himself
command
had
laid
to
leave
you
i
should
stay
black
was
the
bay
of
naples
the
trouble
grew
within
her
eyes
she
seemed
to
feel
as
in
a
dream
the
ruling
force
in
love
that
lies
she
veiled
the
lamplight
yellow
gleam
from
the
black
bay
of
naples
ah
me
she
said
you
tarry
yet
and
late
and
chilly
grows
the
night
shall
my
lamp
be
set
to
guide
you
hither
with
its
light
across
the
bay
of
naples
then
years
i
will
be
yours
but
go
and
dimly
through
the
mist
of
tears
she
saw
the
crescent
line
of
white
high
the
bay
of
naples
for
be
is
all
i
ask
and
need
i
can
not
loose
love
core
said
he
once
to
my
hand
it
has
been
freed
black
was
the
bay
of
naples
nay
death
may
follow
love
is
fit
that
life
being
empty
should
be
cast
carelessly
into
darkness
pit
be
one
with
all
the
life
that
past
black
was
the
bay
of
naples
only
compress
the
joy
of
years
summers
and
seasons
nights
and
noons
to
these
short
hours
where
there
appears
as
of
a
mighty
god
that
swoons
the
sea
black
arm
round
naples
oh
black
beneath
us
are
the
trees
and
black
the
weary
line
of
hills
with
all
life
joy
and
light
and
ease
this
room
your
radiant
presence
fills
black
was
the
bay
of
naples
and
ah
said
he
i
give
my
soul
to
lie
beneath
your
foot
in
hell
that
you
may
walk
unscorched
and
whole
can
other
lovers
love
so
well
black
was
the
bay
of
naples
she
took
his
hand
and
drew
him
in
she
quenched
the
lamplight
yellow
gleam
the
moon
was
like
a
sabre
thin
the
one
white
thing
in
all
that
dream
of
black
that
lay
on
naples
a
song
what
if
the
rose
should
bloom
and
the
sunset
deepen
and
fade
if
we
are
penned
in
the
gloom
by
shutters
made
what
of
the
birds
and
the
sun
and
the
behind
the
trees
to
the
eyes
and
ears
of
one
who
neither
hears
nor
sees
what
of
the
world
of
love
its
fragrance
and
light
and
bloom
to
the
soul
that
can
not
move
out
of
a
loveless
room
were
it
better
the
rose
were
dead
in
a
black
december
frost
that
no
more
skies
were
red
that
lovers
ways
were
lost
ah
no
the
wood
must
shrink
bar
closely
as
you
may
and
between
the
shutters
chink
slips
in
the
sunlight
ray
so
that
the
prisoner
knows
it
is
june
in
the
world
outside
and
his
heart
is
glad
for
the
rose
though
to
him
it
is
denied
for
the
love
of
lovely
things
must
quench
all
bitterness
and
whilst
the
robin
sings
no
heart
is
comfortless
the
ballad
of
a
where
the
water
meets
the
sands
all
alone
sat
she
wrung
her
hair
with
chilly
hands
that
glimmered
mistily
phosphorescent
were
the
drips
from
her
hair
she
wrung
and
like
moonlight
on
her
lips
were
the
words
she
sung
white
she
was
as
white
as
foam
a
moonlit
sky
and
the
treasures
of
her
home
on
her
brow
did
lie
there
he
found
her
he
a
man
wandering
by
the
sea
and
desire
through
him
ran
was
she
there
he
wooed
her
wooed
her
long
till
within
her
eyes
where
were
erst
moonshine
and
song
dawned
in
slow
surprise
mortal
pain
and
mortal
doubt
shades
of
misery
and
she
turned
her
round
about
facing
from
the
sea
in
his
hand
her
hand
she
laid
as
to
land
they
turned
and
her
hand
of
made
his
fingers
burned
on
they
went
then
he
and
she
walking
toward
the
east
and
her
sisters
of
the
sea
their
bewailing
ceased
as
it
paled
towards
the
dawn
from
the
light
they
fled
but
she
laughed
with
joy
is
this
life
she
said
there
was
labour
of
the
day
dust
upon
her
feet
scorching
of
the
shadeless
way
clamour
of
the
street
all
a
human
want
and
pain
laughter
fraught
with
tears
toil
when
toil
we
know
is
vain
hope
when
hopes
are
fears
till
this
creature
of
the
sea
at
the
last
became
human
in
her
misery
joy
and
pride
and
shame
with
a
word
he
left
her
then
woman
that
you
are
mystery
attracts
us
men
draws
us
from
afar
as
you
were
a
thing
intangible
unknown
like
the
light
the
sunbeams
fling
where
the
spray
is
blown
have
you
ceased
to
be
forfeited
the
whole
of
that
moonlight
poetry
cherished
by
man
soul
still
we
seek
the
dim
ideal
as
the
moth
the
star
how
for
women
can
we
feel
that
our
seekings
bar
where
the
water
meets
the
sands
all
alone
sat
she
with
her
head
between
her
hands
facing
from
the
sea
from
her
forehead
pushed
her
hair
drooping
wearily
shivered
by
the
water
there
oh
soul
a
curse
said
she
chrysanthemums
oh
what
a
dainty
negligence
you
show
outspreading
all
your
petals
coquetry
as
careless
of
restraint
as
poetry
although
like
poetry
you
surely
know
that
by
the
laws
of
beauty
you
must
grow
there
is
a
pure
and
virgin
fantasy
in
your
curled
petals
white
as
driven
snow
and
wayward
as
the
unbound
locks
that
blow
around
a
maiden
head
when
mad
with
glee
with
outstretched
arms
she
dances
by
the
sea
yet
in
your
glad
abandon
still
you
show
the
wildest
beauty
must
be
to
give
it
worth
your
leaves
curve
tenderly
in
subtle
arches
so
the
heart
may
know
within
the
dancing
maid

roots

a
ballad
of

richard
king
richard
wiped
the
wine
from
his
lips
and
laughed
full
scornfully
oh
i
care
not
a
bit
for
king
philip
wit
nor
the
honour
of
france
quoth
he
and
i
care
not

reck
if
i
lead
not
this
host
by
the
holy
ghost
may
my
head
be
struck
from
my
neck
king
richard
drank
and
swore
in
his
cups
and
a
mighty
man
was
he
let
the
mongrels
yap
i
care
not
a
rap
i
am
richard
the
lion
quoth
he
the
news
went
forth
to
the
king
of
france
and
the
dukes
of
high
degree
how
richard
had
sworn
that
no
man
born
should
lead
the
armies
but
he
the
kings
were
wroth
at
king
richard
words
that
were
carried
to
them
that
day
does
he
make
a
mock
of
our
ancient
stock
this
king
of
an
hour
quoth
they
this
bastard
son
of
a
bastard
sire
the
standard
first
would
plant
on
the
city
walls
when
jerusalem
falls
must
we
this
honour
grant
not
so
if
christ
would
have
richard
lead
let
christ
give
grace
to
his
arms
we
will
stand
aside
from
the
battle
pride
and
the
fury
of
war
alarms
our
men
are
sick
and
outnumbered
sore
and
words
from
home
reveal
that
our
country
cries
for
our
governance
wise
we
will
look
to
our
country
weal
for
we
came
to
fight
for
a
holy
cause
not
dance
to
an
upstart
king
the
cause
must
wait
for
richard
the
great
for
our
weapons
down
we
fling
breathless
and
hushed
the
messengers
spoke
as
they
told
king
richard
the
news
how
the
kings
were
set
and
the
council
met
and
the
kings
to
fight
refuse
louder
than
ever
laughed
the
king
in
the
depths
of
his
golden
beard
god
rest
my
soul
i
will
reach
the
goal
and
show
if
richard
afeared
i
will
plant
my
flag
amidst
this
camp
as
a
token
seen
of
all
nor
austria
lance
nor
the
frown
of
france
shall
make
its
splendour
fall
so
the
sultry
breezes
of
ascalon
saluted
the
lions
three
and
austria
frowned
from
his
camping
ground
and
cursed
right
bitterly
shall
this
bastard
son
of
a
bastard
sire
boast
he
me
by
the
holy
cross
be
it
living
loss
this
shame
shall
never
be
so
he
planted
his
banner
firm
and
fast
and
it
floated
high
and
free
on
the
selfsame
mound
in
the
christian
ground
flew
eagle
and
lions
three
word
they
brought
to
richard
the
king
where
in
his
tent
he
lay
lo
austria
hand
on
the
lion
land
has
loosed
the
eagle
said
they
richard
arose
and
strode
in
haste
oh
the
banners
floated
free
ill
eagles
fare
in
the
lion
lair
take
down
your
banner
quoth
he
but
word
for
word
the
archduke
gave
he
answered
eagles
fly
let
the
lion
keep
to
the
fields
and
sheep
to
the
eagle
leave
the
sky
do
you
give
me
words
cried
richard
the
king
ho
now
at
your
words
i
laugh
and
he
tore
the
flag
like
a
worthless
rag
and
he
wrenched
and
splintered
the
staff
and
he
set
his
foot
on
the
silken
flag
his
foot
on
austria
fame
with
a
swordless
hip
yet
a
smiling
lip
he
mocked
the
eagle
shame
oh
richard
the
lion
woe
is
me
for
the
sorrow
your
deed
shall
bring
for
the
dungeon
walls
and
the
gloom
that
falls
on
the
heart
of
richard
the
king
for
the
long
despair
of
the
prison
dark
and
the
traffic
in
lordly
things
when
the
austrian
sold
for
an
emperor
gold
the
son
of
the
english
kings
but
richard
laughed
in
the
noonday
sun
that
beats
on
palestine

revenge
for

ancient

given
into

aloud

and

and
the

with

and
the
flowing
golden
beard
no

can
hide
the
huge

by

your

shall
be

fair
thanks
to
you
our
cousin
the

said
richard
no
whit
beguiled
i
thought
not
to
prove
the
worth
of
your
love
when
i
entered
your
land
he
smiled
being
in
haste
to
return
to
my
land
i
passed
in
this
disguise
for
i
would
not
stay
the
rich
display
your
ducal
bounty
supplies
leopold
snarled
like
an
angry
wolf
how
came
you
hither
said
he
no
choice
of
mine
but
by
rule
divine
said
richard
i
came
by
sea
travelling
in
haste
from
palestine
to
assure
me
england
throne
but
a
storm
arose
and
my
fears
suppose
that
i
was
saved
alone
now
bind
his
hands
cried
leopold
for
he
comes
as
a
spy
i
see
the
king
eyes
blazed
in
wrath
amazed
a
ducal
greeting
quoth
he
these
bonds
are
unfitting
duke
leopold
both
mine
and
your
degree
nor
consorts
my
fame
with
a
spying
name
in
your
throat
let
your
own
words
be
amazed
were
they
all
at
richard
taunts
but
he
smiled
with
easy
pride
now
what
prevents
that
my
fury
vents
itself
the
austrian
cried
now
what
prevents
that
i
kill
you
straight
and
your
corpse
to
the
ravens
fling
easy
to
say
you
were
ocean
prey
but
you
dare
not
said
richard
the
king
leopold
turned
to
his
feudal
lords
who
stood
in
wondering
now
prison
me
straight
this
runagate
said
he
let
us
lodge
this
king
they
have
taken
richard
the
and
fettered
him
fast
and
sure
in
a
narrow
cell
they
have
chained
him
well
with
chains
that
shall
endure
and
even
richard
stout
heart
fails
when
he
hears
the
great
doors
clang
and
he
knows
at
last
that
they
have
him
fast
whose
fame
through
europe
rang
oh
what
prevents
the
crafty
duke
from
poison
or
secret
knife
for
no
one
knows
that
richard
goes
in
disguise
in
fear
of
his
life
my
brother
john
will
well
believe
that
i
was
drowned
at
sea
nay
he
scarce
will
ask
but
will
take
the
task
of
kingship
gleefully
and
my
people
will
easily
forget
their
monarch
so
little
seen
and
almost
my
name
will
be
lost
to
fame
i
shall
be
as
i
had
been
many
a
weary
week
and
month
must
darken
prison
walls
and
the
king
eye
dims
and
his
mighty
limbs
waste
as
the
leaf
that
falls
and
his
face
is
blanched
and
sorrow
sits
carven
upon
his
brow
and
his
right
arm
slacks
for
the
the
warlike
field
to
plough
and
yet
and
anon
comes
leopold
his
captive
lord
to
see
and
revenge
to
taste
as
he
sees
him
waste
how
fares
the
lion
cries
he
cousinly
questioned
says
the
king
and
kingly
flashes
his
eye
let
the
hog
beware
of
the
lion
lair
though
the
lion
couchant
lie
and
then
gives
back
duke
leopold
and
his
laugh
has
a
hollow
ring
once
more
he
goes
and
the
shadows
close
round
the
head
and
the
heart
of
the
king
then
word
comes
suddenly
flying
fast
masters
the
king
is
found
and
from
distant
lands
the
poet
stands
at
last
upon
english
ground
i
have
found
him
blondel
de
nesle
as
i
wandered
harp
in
hand
through
breadth
and
length
of
austria
strength
i
saw
a
tower
stand
and
nearer
drew
i
knew
not
why
till
i
heard
a
man
voice
sing
with
something
of
skill
and
my
heart
stood
still
was
the
voice
of
richard
the
king
singing
a
fitte
that
we
both
had
made
once
in
a
banquet
hall
when
his
heart
was
light
of
a
captive
knight
who
out
upon
fate
did
call
then
i
took
up
king
richard
words
and
sang
the
fitte
again
and
did
descry
oh
hope
was
high
that
he
of
it
was
fain
so
i
struck
my
harp
and
sang
once
more
of
a
minstrel
wandering
far
till
he
reached
the
strand
of
a
distant
land
where
trusty
yeomen
are
where
hearts
will
swell
with
joy
to
hear
of
their
dear
and
distant
king
and
burn
for
shame
of
his
knightly
fame
and
the
false
imprisoning
and
richard
sang
from
his
mighty
throat
blondel
blessed
be
thou
thy
star
of
birth
makes
glad
the
earth
thy
wit
shall
save
me
now
tell
my
people
that
i
am
woe
for
my
absence
long
and
drear
when
the
land
did
bleed
under
wolfish
greed
and
the
shepherd
was
not
near
sullen
and
black
was
the
brow
of
john
like
an
angry
but
the
poet
recked
not
in
his
respect
his
message
spake
aloud
tell
my
people
richard
sends
his
heart
in
the
minstrel
hand
and
my
eyes
shall
yearn
until
they
turn
on
the
cliffs
of
my
loyal
land
this
do
i
add
at
night
and
morn
when
i
pray
for
the
fall
of
zion
to
my
people
send
a
better
friend
oh
god
than
richard
the
lion
in
the
valley
of
the
shadow
what
can
death
render
us
commensurate
with
what
it
takes
away
the
voice
of
birds
on
sweet
spring
mornings
and
the
face
of
spring
and
lush
long
grass
around
the
browsing
herds
and
shadows
on
the
distant
hills
the
flying
fling
what
is
there
brighter
in
the
world
to
come
than
flashing
in
the
sun
above
the
blue
atlantic
what
more
free
yet
what
more
stable
than
those
white
wings
strung
all
motionless
against
a
wind
that
whips
the
racing
sea
yea
and
if
these
things
yet
may
be
the
soul
the
summer
moon
above
the
garden
flowers
and
the
slow
song
of
nightingales
yea
and
if
all
these
after
death
be
ours
more
beauty
yet
and
peace
from
strife
yet
still
the
debt
prevails
for
what
can
ever
give
us
back
again
the
dear
familiar
things
of
every
day
the
loved
and
common
language
that
we

presland

is
a
fine
piece

excellent
in
its
presentation
of
character
impressive
in
sentiment
and
dignified
in
metre
it
lacks
none
of
the
greater
qualities
of
the
historical
drama
the
author
remains
as
simple
and
dignified
in
style
as
in
his
treatment
of
the
tragedy
of

there
is
no
painful

presland
gives
promise
of
becoming
one
of
the
most
successful
living
writers
of
poetic
drama
his
of

we
have
reason
to
remember
his
mary
is
no
less
striking
there
is
no
swinburnian
welter
of
poetry
here
but
a
very
dramatically
presented
study
of
a
very
baffling
woman
it
would
be
difficult
for
anyone
to
cavil
at
the
poet
presentation
of
the
time
nothing
could
be
finer
from
a
dramatic
point
of
view
than
her
acting
after
the
murder
of
rizzio
the
last
act
is
a
splendid
bit
of
work
the
savagery
of
the
street
song
and
the
last
speech
of
mary
before
signing
her
abdication
are
equally
dramatic
and
equally
poetic
on
very
diverse
lines
the
play
is
altogether
noteworthy
it
would
in
our
estimation
be
a
decided
acquisition
to
any
who
could
arrange
with

to
deal
with
it
here
as

as
it
deserves

we
with
pleasure
commend
it
to
our
readers

the
most
emphatic
way

work

even
exceeds
his
marked

theme

history

heroic

its
progress
is
well
planned
and
it
proceeds
with
spirit
several
of

splendidly
dramatic

the
right
moment

the
atmosphere

poetry
in
which
shakespeare
moves
with
such
freedom
joan
is
the
soul
and
centre
of
the
play
and
the
author
has
done
nobly
by
her
we
catch
as
we
read
some
of
the
infection
that
fell
upon
men
souls
from
her
presence
which
simply
means
that
presland
has
realised
his
historical
characters
so
well
as
to
make
them
seem
living
what
we
have
written
is
sufficient
to
show

what

approached

with

success

picture

upon
him

joan
and
that
not
because

anything

the

its
impressiveness
is
heightened
by
the
dignity
of
the
blank

there
is
poetry
on
every

but
the
effects
are
gained
not

by

can
only

to
read

will
see
that

a
living
thing

presland
follows
up
his
dramas

queen
of
scots
with
a
picture
at
once
moving
and
terrible
of
the
siege
of
venice
by
the
austrians
in
he
has
once
more
proved
himself
a
dramatist
of
that
high
poetic
order
which
we
have
so
often
been
told
died
out
with
the
eighteenth
century
his
new
work
condenses
into
four
acts
of
vigorous
and
flexible
blank
verse
always
animated
in
movement
and
skilfully
wrought
together
into
a
fine
unity
of
action
presland
manin
is
an
impressive
pathetic
figure
and
the
play
one
which
cultured
readers
should
follow
with
unqualified
the
poetry
never
clogs
the
action
and
the
whole
play
is
tense
with
the
struggle
in
the
soul
of
the
hero
the
play
thus
becomes
the
tragedy
of
a
city
but
the
triumph
of
a
man
and
the
interplay
of
the
two
ideas
is
finely
wrought
out
it
is
not
all
sombre
but
even
the
gayest
of
its
characters
throbs
to
the
of
italy
and
helps
to
give
unity
to
the
drama
written
in
blank
verse
that
is
both
flexible
and
dramatic
the
author
gives
an
effect
of
spaciousness
combined
with
tense
feeling
in
the
unfolding
of
the
story
presland
shows
much
greater
genius
than
he
did
in
either
of
his
two
previous
dramatic
works
the
verse
is
most
flexible
and
practically
all
through
he
moves
with
great
freedom
and
reaches
real
dignity
the
action
seldom
flags
and
the
whole
work
is
truly
dramatic
especially
might
we
pick
out
the
last
act
as
extremely
powerful
throughout
this
admirable
piece
of
dramatic
work
there
is
clear
evidence
of
the
author
extraordinary
power
as
a
delineator
in
poetic
drama
of
human
character
in
its
many
phases
his
of
arc
was
a
work
which
one
could
not
fail
to
remember
by
reason
of
its
striking
characteristics
but
we
are
convinced
that
remembrance
of
the
of
venice
will
be
equally
if
not
more
indelible
