a

my
father
in
his
long
life
has
seldom
been
conscious
of
a
man
rough
exterior
or
unconscious
of
his
obscurest
preface
to
the
third
edition
cowboys
are
the
sternest
critics
of
those
who
would
represent
the
west
no
hypocrisy
no
bluff
no
pose
can
evade
them
yet
cowboys
have
made
badger
clark
songs
their
own
so
readily
have
they
circulated
that
often
the
man
who
sings
the
song
could
not
tell
you
where
it
started
many
of
the
poems
have
become
folk
songs
of
the
west
we
may
say
of
america
for
they
speak
of
freedom
and
the
open
generous
has
been
the
praise
given
and
saddle
but
perhaps
no
criticism
has
summed
up
the
work
so
satisfactorily
as
the
comment
of
the
old
cow
man
who
said
you
can
break
me
if
there
a
dead
poem
in
the
book
i
read
the
hull
of
it
who
in
h
is
this
kid
clark
anyway
i
do
know
how
he
knowed
but
he
that
is
what
proves
badger
clark
the
real
poet
he
knows
beyond
his
wonderful
presentation
of
the
west
is
the
quality
of
universal
appeal
that
makes
his
work
real
art
he
has
tied
the
west
to
the
universe
the
old
cow
man
is
not
the
only
one
who
has
wondered
who
badger
clark
was
charles
wharton
stork
speaking
of
and
saddle
said
it
has
splendid
flavor
and
fine
artistic
handling
as
well
i
should
like
to
know
more
of
the
author
whether
he
was
a
cow
puncher
or
merely
got
inside
his
psychology
by
imagination
badger
clark
was
brought
up
in
the
west
as
a
boy
he
lived
in
deadwood
south
dakota
the
town
at
that
time
was
trying
to
live
down
the
reputation
for
exuberant
indecorum
which
she
had
acquired
during
the
gold
rush
but
her
five
churches
operating
two
hours
a
week
could
make
little
headway
against
the
competition
of
two
dance
halls
and
saloons
running
hours
a
day
perhaps
it
was
these
early
impressions
that
make
piano
at
in
clark
later
volume
grown
so
vivid
scuffling
feet
and
thud
of
fists
curses
hot
as
fire
still
the
music
sang
of
love
longin
lost
desire
dreams
that
never
could
have
been
joys
that
could
stay
while
the
man
upon
the
floor
wiped
the
blood
away
after
clark
had
grown
up
in
the
cow
country
near
the
mexican
border
he
stumbled
unexpectedly
into
paradise
he
was
given
charge
of
a
small
ranch
and
the
responsibility
for
a
bunch
of
cattle
just
large
enough
to
amuse
him
but
too
small
to
demand
a
full
day
work
once
a
month
the
sky
was
persistently
blue
the
sunlight
was
richly
golden
the
folds
of
the
barren
mountains
and
the
wide
reaches
of
the
range
were
full
of
many
lovely
colors
and
his
nearest
neighbor
was
eight
miles
away
the
cow
men
who
dropped
in
for
a
meal
now
and
then
in
the
course
of
their
interminable
riding
appeared
to
have
ridden
directly
out
of
books
of
adventure
with
faces
full
of
sun
wrinkles
careless
mouths
full
of
bad
grammar
strange
oaths
and
stranger
yarns
and
hearts
for
the
most
part
as
open
and
shadowless
as
the
country
they
daily
ranged
in
the
evenings
as
clark
placed
his
boot
heels
on
the
porch
railing
smote
the
strings
of
his
guitar
and
broke
the
tense
silence
of
the
warm
dry
twilight
with
song
he
often
wondered
as
his
eyes
rested
dreamily
on
the
spikey
yuccas
that
stood
out
sharp
and
black
against
the
clear
lemon
color
of
the
sunset
west
why
hermit
life
in
the
desert
was
traditionally
a
sad
penitential
affair
in
a
letter
to
his
mother
a
month
or
two
after
settling
in
arizona
he
found
prose
too
weak
to
express
his
utter
content
and
perpetrated
his
first
verses
she
with
natural
pride
sent
the
verses
to
a
magazine
the
old
and
a
week
or
two
later
the
desert
dweller
was
astonished
beyond
measure
to
receive
his
first
editorial
check
the
discovery
that
certain
people
in
the
world
were
willing
to
pay
money
for
such
rhymes
as
he
could
write
bent
the
whole
course
of
his
subsequent
life
for
good
or
evil
and
the
occasional
lyric
impulse
hardened
into
a
habit
which
has
consumed
much
of
his
time
and
most
of
his
serious
thought
since
that
date
the
verses
written
to
his
mother
were
the
first
poem
in
his
first
book
and
saddle
and
the
greater
part
of
the
poems
in
both
and
saddle
and
grown
were
written
in
arizona
and
saddle
and
grown
are
books
of
western
songs
simple
and
ringing
and
yet
with
an
ample
vision
that
makes
them
unique
among
poems
written
in
a
local
vernacular
the
spirit
of
them
is
eternal
the
spirit
of
youth
in
the
open
and
their
background
is
god
reserves
the
vast
reach
of
western
mesa
and
plain
that
will
always
remain
free
the
way
that
it
was
when
the
world
was
new
every
poem
carries
a
breath
of
plains
with
a
tang
of
camp
smoke
and
varied
as
they
are
in
tune
and
tone
they
do
not
contain
a
single
note
that
is
labored
or
unnatural
they
are
of
native
western
stock
as
indigenous
to
the
soil
as
the
agile
cow
ponies
whose
hoofs
evidently
beat
the
time
for
their
swinging
measures
and
it
is
this
quality
as
well
as
their
appealing
music
that
has
already
given
them
such
wide
popularity
east
and
west
that
they
were
born
in
the
saddle
and
written
for
love
rather
than
for
publication
is
a
conviction
that
the
reader
of
them
can
hardly
escape
from
the
impish
merriment
of
to
the
deep
but
fearless
piety
of
cowboy
these
songs
ring
true
and
are
as
healthy
as
the
big
bright
country
whence
they
came
in
about
the
time
our
first
edition
of
and
saddle
began
to
run
low
we
fortunately
discovered
huffman
of
miles
city
montana
the
illustrator
who
in
began
taking
photographs
from
the
saddle
with
crude
cameras
he
made
over
to
meet
his
needs
these
same
views
were
the
first
of
the
now
famous
huffman
pictures
beginning
with
the
indians
and
buffaloes
round
about
keogh
on
the
yellowstone
where
he
was
post
photographer
for
general
miles
army
during
those
stirring
territorial
days
the
huffman
studio
is
still
one
of
the
show

of

and
the

also

streams
and
her
face
i

frequent
in

live
my
life
as
i
begun
and
give
me
work
that
open
to
the
sky
make
me
a
pardner
of
the
wind
and
sun
and
i
wo
ask
a
life
that
soft
or
high
let
me
be
easy
on
the
man
that
down
let
me
be
square
and
generous
with
all
i
careless
sometimes
lord
when
i
in
town
but
never
let
say
i
mean
or
small
make
me
as
big
and
open
as
the
plains
as
honest
as
the
hawse
between
my
knees
clean
as
the
wind
that
blows
behind
the
rains
free
as
the
hawk
that
circles
down
the
breeze
forgive
me
lord
if
sometimes
i
forget
you
know
about
the
reasons
that
are
hid
you
understand
the
things
that
gall
and
fret
you
know
me
better
than
my
mother
did
just
keep
an
eye
on
all
that
done
and
said
and
right
me
sometimes
when
i
turn
aside
and
guide
me
on
the
long
dim
trail
ahead
that
stretches
upward
toward
the
great
divide
the
christmas
trail
the
wind
is
blowin
cold
down
the
mountain
tips
of
snow
and
the
ranges
layin
brown
and
dead
it
cryin
through
the
valley
trees
that
wear
the
mistletoe
and
mournin
with
the
gray
clouds
overhead
yet
it
sweet
with
the
beat
of
my
little
hawse
feet
and
i
whistle
like
the
air
was
warm
and
blue
for
i
ridin
up
the
christmas
trail
to
you
old
folks
i
up
the
christmas
trail
to
you
oh
mebbe
it
was
good
when
the
whinny
of
the
spring
had
wheedled
me
to
hoppin
of
the
bars
and
livin
in
the
shadow
of
a
sailin
buzzard
wing
and
sleepin
underneath
a
roof
of
stars
but
the
bright
campfire
light
only
dances
for
a
night
while
the
burns
forever
clear
and
true
so
the
year
i
circle
back
to
you
old
folks
the
rovin
year
i
circle
back
to
you
oh
mebbe
it
was
good
when
the
reckless
summer
sun
had
shot
a
charge
of
fire
through
my
veins
and
i
milled
around
the
whiskey
and
the
fightin
and
the
fun
the
other
drifted
from
the
plains
ay
the
pot
bubbled
hot
while
you
reckoned
i
forgot
and
the
devil
smacked
the
young
blood
in
his
stew
yet
i
lovin
every
mile
that
nearer
you
good
folks
lovin
every
blessed
mile
that
nearer
you
oh
mebbe
it
was
good
at
the
roundup
in
the
fall
when
the
clouds
of
bawlin
dust
before
us
ran
and
the
pride
of
rope
and
saddle
was
of
us
all
to
a
stretch
of
nerve
and
muscle
man
and
man
but
the
pride
sort
of
died
when
the
man
got
weary
eyed
was
a
sleepy
boy
that
rode
the
through
and
he
dreamed
himself
along
a
trail
to
you
old
folks
dreamed
himself
along
a
happy
trail
to
you
the
coyote
winter
howl
cuts
the
dusk
behind
the
hill
but
the
ranch
shinin
window
i
kin
see
and
though
i
do
deserve
it
and
i
reckon
never
will
there
be
room
beside
the
fire
kep
for
me
skimp
my
plate
i
late
let
me
hit
the
old
kid
gait
for
tonight
i
stumblin
tired
of
the
new
and
i
ridin
up
the
christmas
trail
to
you
old
folks
i
up
the
christmas
trail
to
you
a
border
affair
spanish

the
lovin
tongue
soft
as
music
light
as

was
a
girl
i
learnt
it
from
livin
down
sonora
way
i
do
look
much
like
a
lover
yet
i
say
her
love
words
over
often
when
i
all
alone
mi
amor
mi
corazon
nights
when
she
knew
where
i
ride
she
would
listen
for
my
spurs
fling
the
big
door
open
wide
raise
them
laughin
eyes
of
hers
and
my
heart
would
nigh
stop
when
i
heard
her
tender
greetin
whispered
soft
for
me
alone
mi
amor
mi
corazon
moonlight
in
the
patio
old

noddin
near
me
and
juana
talkin
low
so
the

could
hear
how
those
hours
would
go
and
too
soon
i
hear
her
in
her
little
sorry
tone
adios
mi
corazon
but
one
time
i
had
to
fly
for
a
foolish
gamblin
fight
and
we
said
a
swift
goodbye
in
that
black
unlucky
night
when
i
loosed
her
arms
from
with
her
words
the
hoofs
kep
as
i
galloped
north
alone
adios
mi
corazon
never
seen
her
since
that
night
i
kaint
cross
the
line
you
know
she
was
mex
and
i
was
white
like
as
not
it
better
so
yet
i
always
sort
of
missed
her
since
that
last
wild
night
i
kissed

we

tried
by
a

our

fireside
into

you
let
droop
you
about
as
tuneful
as
a
coyote
with
the
croup
the
cold
wind
bit
when
we
drifted
down
the
draw
we
drifted
on
to
comfort
and
to
turkey
in
the
straw
snarlin
when
the
rain
whipped
cussin
at
the
ford
mile
of
twenty
was
a
long
discord

the
night
is
brimmin

its
glory
is
complete
when
the

is
by

bacon

livin
is
a

that

years
from
now
on

reddy
soul
is
willin
but
he
gettin
short
o

the
storm
wind
sings
and
old
trouble
sucks
his
we
have
an
hour
of
firelight
set
to
turkey
in
the
straw
the
outlaw
when
my
rope
takes
hold
on
a
by
the
foot
or
the
neck
or
the
horn
he
kin
plunge
and
fight
till
his
eyes
go
white
but
i
throw
him
as
sure
as
you
born
though
the
taut
ropes
sing
like
a
banjo
string
and
the
latigoes
creak
and
strain
yet
i
got
no
fear
of
an
outlaw
steer
and
i
tumble
him
on
the
plain
a
man
is
a
man
but
a
steer
is
a
beast
the
man
is
the
boss
of
the
herd
each
of
the
bunch
from
the
biggest
to
least
come
down
when
he
says
the
when
my
leg
swings
on
an
outlaw
hawse
and
my
spurs
clinch
into
his
hide
he
kin
and
pitch
over
hill
and
ditch
but
wherever
he
goes
i
ride
let
spin
and
flop
like
a
crazy
top
or
flit
like
a
smoke
but
he
know
the
feel
of
my
rowelled
heel
till
he
happy
to
own
he
broke
a
man
is
a
man
and
a
hawse
is
a
brute
the
hawse
may
be
prince
of
his
he
bow
to
the
bit
and
the
own
that
his
boss
is
the
when
the
devil
at
rest
underneath
my
vest
gets
up
and
begins
to
paw
and
my
hot
tongue
strains
at
its
bridle
reins
then
i
tackle
the
real
outlaw
when
i
get
plumb
riled
and
my
sense
goes
wild
and
my
temper
is
fractious
growed
if
he
hump
his
neck
just
a
triflin
speck
then
it
dollars
to
dimes
i
throwed
a
man
is
a
man
but
he
partly
a
kin
brag
till
he
makes
you
deaf
the
one
lone
brute
from
the
west
to
the
east
he
kaint
quite
break
is
illustration
taut
ropes
sing
like
a
banjo
the
latigoes
creak
and
the
legend
of
boastful
bill
at
a
roundup
on
the
gily
one
sweet
mornin
long
ago
ten
of
us
was
throwed
right
freely
by
a
hawse
from
idaho
and
we
thought
he
for
a
man
to
break
his
pride
till
up
one
leggin
boastful
bill
cut
loose
and
cried
a
proposition
for
to
hurt
fulfil
my
earthly
mission
with
a
quirt
kin
ride
the
highest
the
gulf
and
powder
river
i
break
this
thing
as
easy
as
i
so
bill
climbed
the
northern
fury
and
they
mangled
up
the
air
till
a
native
of
missouri
would
have
owned
his
brag
was
fair
though
the
plunges
kep
him
and
the
wind
it
flapped
his
shirt
loud
above
the
hawse
we
could
hear
our
friend
assert
the
one
to
take
such
rakin
as
a
one
hand
me
up
the
makin
of
a
smoke
you
think
my
fame
needs
i
rope
a
streak
of
i
cinch
up
and
spur
till
he
then
one
caper
of
repulsion
broke
that
hawse
back
in
two
cinches
snapped
in
the
convulsion
skyward
man
and
saddle
flew
up
he
mounted
never
laggin
while
we
watched
him
through
our
tears
and
his
last
thin
bit
of
came
to
our
ears
you
ever
watched
my
habits
very
would
know
i
broke
such
rabbits
by
the
have
kep
my
talent
hidin
too
good
for
earthly
i
off
to
bust
the
lightnin
adios
years
have
gone
since
that
ascension
boastful
bill
ai
never
lit
so
we
reckon
that
he
some
celestial
outlaw
bit
when
the
night
rain
beats
our
slickers
and
the
wind
is
swift
and
stout
and
the
lightnin
flares
and
flickers
we
kin
sometimes
hear
him
shout
a
wonder
on
the
fly
the
ridin
of
the
you
earthlin
shut
your
we
rippin
clouds
to
this
darlin
kicks
at
you
you
die
stardust
on
his
chaps
and
saddle
scornful
still
of
jar
and
jolt
he
come
back
some
day
astraddle
of
a
thunderbolt
and
the
generation
of
that
dim
and
distant
day
sure
will
stare
with
admiration
when
they
hear
old
boastful
say
was
first
as
old
rawhiders
all
i
last
of
all
rough
riders
and
the
you
soft
and
dainty
floaters
your
and
motors
are
you
the
great
grandchildren
of
the
west
the
tied
maverick
lay
on
the
iron
the
tie
holds
fast
and
my
wild
record
closes
this
maverick
is
down
at
last
just
roped
and
tied
with
roses
and
one
small
girl
to
blame
for
it
yet
i
do
fight
with
shame
for
it
lay
on
the
iron
i
game
for
it
just
roped
and
tied
with
roses
i
loped
among
the
wildest
band
of
winners
gay
colts
that
never
felt
a
brand
and
scarred
old
outlaw
sinners
the
wind
was
rein
and
guide
to
us
the
world
was
pasture
wide
to
us
and
our
wild
name
was
pride
to
us
high
headed
bronco
sinners
so
loose
and
light
we
raced
and
fought
and
every
range
we
tasted
but
now
since
i
corralled
and
caught
i
know
them
days
were
wasted
from
now
the
gait
for
me
the
trail
that
hard
but
straight
for
me
for
down
that
trail
who
wait
for
me
ay
them
old
days
were
wasted
but
though
i
broke
i
never
be
a
old
groaner
for
never
worthless
bronc
like
me
got
such
a
gentle
owner
there
could
be
colt
days
glad
as
mine
or
outlaw
runs
as
mad
as
mine
or
falls
as
bad
as
mine
but
never
such
an
owner
lay
on
the
iron
and
lay
it
red
i
take
it
kind
and
clever
who
would
hold
a
prouder
head
to
wear
that
mark
forever
i
never
break
and
stray
from
her
i
starve
and
die
away
from
her
lay
on
the
iron
it
play
from
her
and
brand

hers
forever
a
roundup
lullaby
desert
blue
and
silver
in
the
still
moonshine
coyote
yappin
lazy
on
the
hill
sleepy
winks
of
lightnin
down
the
far
sky
line
time
for
millin

to
be

o

coyote
nothiny
skeery
singin
to
his

down
you

till
the
nothin
out
the
hazy

that
you
folks
need
nothin
we
kin
see
to
take
your
eye
yet
we
got
to
watch
you
or
you
all
stampede
plungin
down
some
bank
to
die
o
now
for
still
the
shadows
stay
moon
is
slow
and
steady
sun
comes
when
he
ya
tammalalleday
use
runnin
out
to
meet
the
cows
and
men
are
foolish
when
the
light
grows
dim
dreamin
of
a
land
too
far
to
see
there
you
dream
is
wavin
grass
and
streams
that
brim
and
it
often
seems
the
same
to
me
o
now
for
dreams
they
never
dust
it
keeps
us
blinkin
seven
miles
from
ya
tammalalleday
we
got
to
stand
it
till
the
mostly
it
a
moonlight
world
our
trail
winds
through
kaint
see
much
beyond
our
saddle
horns
always
far
away
is
misty
always
underfoot
it
rocks
and
thorns
o
now
it
must
be
this
away
lonesome
owl
mournful
coyote
ya
tammalalleday
do
sing
until
the
always
seein
dreams
of
always
feelin
thorns
that
slab
and
sting
yet
stampedin
never
made
a
dream
come
true
so
i
ride
around
myself
and
sing
o
now
a
man
has
got
to
stay
or
workin
on
and
ya
tammalalleday
of
us
are
waitin
for
the
the
trail
o
love
my
love
was
swift
and
slender
as
an
antelope
at
play
and
her
eyes
were
gray
and
tender
as
the
east
at
break
o
day
and
i
sure
was
shaky
hearted
and
her
flower
face
was
pale
on
that
silver
night
we
parted
when
i
sang
along
the
trail
forever
moon
above
the
pine
the
matin
birds
in
springtime
will
twitter
while
you
as
ore
with
gold
as
sparklin
springs
as
redwoods
ever
growin
will
be
this
love
o
i
rode
across
the
river
and
beyond
the
far
divide
till
the
echo
of
forever
staggered
faint
behind
and
died
for
the
long
trail
smiled
and
beckoned
and
the
free
wind
blowed
so
sweet
that
life
gayest
tune
i
reckoned
was
my
hawse
ringin
feet
forever
stars
look
down
and
sigh
a
poison
spring
will
the
trustin
drinker
a
rovin
bird
will
a
worthless
rock
will
the
maiden
love
is
the
man
is
proved
a
last
the
rover
circle
brought
me
where
i
used
to
be
and
i
met
her
gaily
with
a
smarter
man
than
me
then
i
raised
my
dusty
cover
but
she
did
see
nor
hear
so
i
hummed
the
old
tune
over
laughin
in
my
hawse
ear
the
snowflake
specks
the
the
yucca
blooms
what
gloom
the
mountain
the
driftin
cloud
shade
hovers
the
trail
o
parted
lovers
forever
lasts
a
mile
our
lives
are
hid
our
trails
are
strange
we
scattered
through
the
west
in
canyon
cool
on
blistered
range
or
windy
mountain
crest
wherever
nature
drops
her
ears
and
bares
her
claws
to
scratch
from
yuma
to
the
north
frontiers
you
likely
find
the
bach
you
will
the
shy
and
sober
bach
our
days
are
sun
and
storm
and
mist
the
same
as
any
life
except
that
in
our
trouble
list
we
never
count
a
wife
each
has
a
reason
why
he
lone
but
keeps
it
his
hat
or
if
he
got
to
tell
some
one
confides
it
to
his
cat
he
does
just
tells
it
to
his
cat
we
young
or
old
or
slow
or
fast
but
all
plumb
versatyle
the
mighty
bach
that
fires
the
blast
kin
serve
up
beans
in
style
the
bach
that
ropes
the
plungin
cows
kin
mix
the
biscuits
true
we
earn
our
grub
by
drippin
brows
and
cook
it
by
too
we
do
we
cook
it
by
too
we
like
to
breathe
unbranded
air
be
free
of
foot

you
salty
and

and
smoky
as
sin
but
of
all
grub
we
love
you
the
best
you
stuck
to
us
closer
than
nighest
of
kin
and
helped
us
win
out
in
the
west
you
froze
with
us
up
on
the
laramie
trail
you
sweat
with
us
down
at
tucson
when
injun
was
painted
and
white
man
was
pale
you
nerved
us
to
grip
our
last
chance
by
the
tail
and
load
up
our
colts
and
hang
on
you
sizzled
by
mountain
and
mesa
and
plain
over
campfires
of
sagebrush
and
oak
the
breezes
that
blow
from
the
platte
to
the
main
have
carried
your
savory
smoke
you
friendly
to
miner
or
puncher
or
priest
you
as
good
in
december
as
may
you
always
came
in
when
the
fresh
meat
had
ceased
and
the
rough
course
of
empire
to
westward
was
greased
by
the
bacon
we
fried
on
the
way
we
said
that
you
were
fit
for
white
men
to
eat
and
your
virtues
we
often
forget
we
called
you
by
names
that
i
dars
repeat
but
we
love
you
and
swear
by
you
yet
here
to
you
old
bacon
fat
lean
streak
and
rin
all
the
westerners
join
in
the
toast
from
mesquite
and
yucca
to
sagebrush
and
pine
from
canada
down
to
the
mexican
line
from
omaha
out
to
the
coast
the
lost
pardner
i
ride
alone
and
hate
the
boys
i
meet
today
some
way
their
laughin
hurts
me
so
i
hate
the
in
the
mesquite
and
yet
i
liked
just
a
week
ago
i
hate
the
steady
sun
that
glares
and
glares
the
bird
songs
make
me
sore
i
seem
the
only
thing
on
earth
that
cares
al
ai
here
no
more
was
just
a
stumblin
hawse
a
tangled
spur
and
when
i
raised
him
up
so
limp
and
weak
one
look
before
his
eyes
begun
to
blur
and
then
the
blood
that
would
let
speak
and
him
so
strong
and
yet
so
quick
he
died
and
after
year
on
year
when
we
had
always
trailed
it
side
by
side
he
went
and
left
me
here
we
loved
each
other
in
the
way
men
do
and
never
spoke
about
it
al
and
me
but
we
both
and
knowin
it
so
true
was
more
than
any
woman
kiss
could
be
we
knowed
and
if
the
way
was
smooth
or
rough
the
weather
shine
or
pour
while
i
had
him
the
rest
seemed
good
enough
but
he
ai
here
no
more
what
is
there
out
beyond
the
last
divide
seems
like
that
country
must
be
cold
and
dim
he
miss
this
sunny
range
he
used
to
ride
and
he
miss
me
the
same
as
i
do
him
it
no
use
thinkin
all
i
think
or
say
could
never
make
it
clear
out
that
dim
trail
that
only
leads
one
way
he
gone
and
left
me
here
the
range
is
empty
and
the
trails
are
blind
and
i
do
seem
but
half
myself
today
i
wait
to
hear
him
ridin
up
behind
and
feel
his
knee
rub
mine
the
good
old
way
he
dead
and
what
that
means
no
man
kin
tell
some
call
it
gone
before
where
i
do
know
but
god
i
know
so
well
that
he
ai
here
no
more
illustration
wait
to
hear
him
ridin
up
god
reserves
one
time
back
where
the
year
marks
fade
god
said
i
see
i
must
lose
my
west
the
prettiest
part
of
the
world
i
made
the
place
where
i
always
come
to
rest
for
the
white
man
grows
till
he
fights
for
bread
and
he
begs
and
prays
for
a
chance
to
spread
yet
i
wo
give
all
of
my
last
retreat
i
help
him
to
fight
his
long
trail
through
but
i
keep
some
land
from
his
field
and
street
the
way
that
it
was
when
the
world
was
new
he
cry
for
it
all
for
that
his
way
and
yet
he
may
understand
some
day
and
so
from
the
painted
bad
lands
to
the
home
of
the
kin
god
stripped
some
places
to
sand
and
clay
and
dried
up
the
beds
where
the
streams
had
been
he
marked
his
reserves
with
these
plain
signs
and
stationed
his
rangers
to
guard
the
lines
then
the
white
man
came
as
the
east
growed
old
and
blazed
his
trail
with
the
wreck
of
war
he
riled
the
rivers
to
hunt
for
gold
and
found
the
stuff
he
was
lookin
for
then
he
trampled
the
injun
trails
to
ruts
and
gashed
through
the
hills
with
railroad
cuts
he
flung
out
his
fences
wide
and
plowed
up
the
ground
where
the
grass
was
high
he
stripped
off
the
trees
from
the
mountain
side
and
ground
out
his
ore
where
the
streams
run
by
till
last
came
the
cities
with
smoke
and
roar
and
the
white
man
was
feelin
at
home
once
more
but
barrenness
loneliness
suchlike
things
that
gall
and
grate
on
the
white
man
nerves
was
the
rangers
that
camped
by
the
bitter
springs
and
guarded
the
lines
of
god
reserves
so
the
folks
all
shy
from
the
desert
land
mebbe
a
few
that
kin
understand
there
the
world
the
same
as
the
day
was
new
with
the
land
as
clean
as
the
smokeless
sky
and
never
a
noise
as
the
years
have
flew
but
the
sound
of
the
warm
wind
driftin
by
and
there
alone
with
the
man
world
far
there
a
chance
to
think
who
you
really
are
and
over
the
reach
of
the
desert
bare
when
the
sun
drops
low
and
the
day
wind
stills
sometimes
you
kin
almost
see
him
there
as
he
sits
alone
on
the
hills
of
things
that
beyond
our
ken
and
restin
himself
from
the
noise
of
men
the
married
man
there
an
old
pard
of
mine
that
sits
by
his
door
and
watches
the
evenin
skies
he
sat
there
a
thousand
of
evenin
before
and
i
reckon
he
will
till
he
dies
el
pobre
i
reckon
he
will
till
he
dies
and
hear
through
the
dim
quiet
air
far
cattle
that
call
and
the
crickets
that
cheep
and
his
woman
a
kid
to
sleep
and
the
creak
of
her
rockabye
chair
once
we
made
camp
where
the
last
light
would
fail
and
the
east
was
white
till
we
start
but
now
he
is
deaf
to
the
call
of
the
trail
and
the
song
of
the
restless
heart
el
pobre
the
song
of
the
restless
heart
that
you
hear
in
the
wind
from
the
dawn
he
left
it
with
all
the
good
things
for
a
slow
little
song
that
a
tired
woman
sings
and
a
smoke
when
his
dry
day
is
gone
i
rode
in
and
told
him
of
lands
that
were
strange
where
i
drifted
from
glory
to
dread
he
tell
me
the
news
of
his
little
old
range
and
the
cute
things
his
kids
had
said
el
pobre
the
cute
things
his
kids
had
said
and
the
way
billy
could
ride
and
the
dark
would
creep
in
from
the
gray
chaparral
and
the
woman
would
hum
while
i
pitied
my
pal
and
thought
of
him
like
he
had
died
he
rides
in
old
circles
and
looks
at
old
sights
and
his
life
is
as
flat
as
a
pond
he
loves
the
old
skyline
he
watches
of
nights
and
he
do
seem
to
care
for
beyond
el
pobre
he
do
seem
to
dream
of
beyond
nor
the
room
he
could
find
there
for
joy
ai
you
ever
oneasy
says
i
one
day
but
he
only
just
smiled
in
a
pityin
way
while
he
braided
a
quirt
for
his
boy
he
preaches
that
i
orter
fold
up
my
wings
and
that
even
wild
geese
find
a
nest
that
woman
and
wimmen
are
different
things
and
a
saddle
nap
is
a
rest
el

he
more
for
the
shade
and
the
rest
and
he
less
for
the
wind
and
the
fight
yet
out
in
strange
hills
when
the
blue
shadows
rise
and
i
tired
from
the
wind
and
the
sun
in
my
eyes
i
wonder
sometimes
if
he
right
i
courted
the
wind
and
i
followed
her
free
from
the
snows
that
the
low
stars
have
kissed
to
the
heave
and
the
dip
of
the
wavy
old
sea
yet
i
reckon
there
somethin
i
missed
el

yes
mebbe
there
somethin
i
missed
and
it
mebbe
is
more
than
i
won
just
a
door
that
my
own
while
the
cool
shadows
creep
and
a

my

to
sleep
when
i
tired
from
the
wind
and
the

el

strange
it
nearly
fetched
the
tears
i
had
to
let
ten
fences
down
the
fussy
lanes

each
new

the
plainsmen
men
of
the
older
gentler
soil
loving
the
things
that
their
fathers
wrought
worn
old
fields
of
their
fathers
toil
scarred
old
hills
where
their
fathers
fought
loving
their
land
for
each
ancient
trace
like
a
mother
dear
for
her
wrinkled
face
such
as
they
never
can
understand
the
way
we
have
loved
you
young
young
land
born
of
a
free
race
little
we
yearned
an
sod
what
did
we
care
for
the
fathers
place
having
ours
fresh
from
the
hand
of
god
who
feared
the
strangeness
or
wiles
of
you
when
from
the
unreckoned
miles
of
you
thrilling
the
wind
with
a
sweet
command
youth
unto
youth
called
young
young
land
north
where
the
hurrying
seasons
changed
over
great
gray
plains
where
the
trails
lay
long
free
as
the
sweeping
chinook
we
ranged
setting
our
days
to
a
saddle
song
through
the
icy
challenge
you
flung
to
us
through
your
shy
spring
kisses
that
clung
to
us
following
far
as
the
rainbow
spanned
fiercely
we
wooed
you
young
young
land
south
where
the
sullen
black
mountains
guard
limitless
shimmering
lands
of
the
sun
over
blinding
trails
where
the
hoofs
rang
hard
laughing
or
cursing
we
rode
and
won
drunk
with
the
virgin
white
fire
of
you
hotter
than
thirst
was
desire
of
you
straight
in
our
faces
you
burned
your
brand
marking
your
chosen
ones
young
young
land
when
did
we
long
for
the
sheltered
gloom
of
the
older
game
with
its
cautious
odds
gloried
we
always
in
sun
and
room
spending
our
strength
like
the
younger
gods
by
the
wild
sweet
ardor
that
ran
in
us
by
the
pain
that
tested
the
man
in
us
by
the
shadowy
springs
and
the
glaring
sand
you
were
our
young
young
land
when
the
last
free
trail
is
a
prim
fenced
lane
and
our
graves
grow
weeds
through
forgetful
mays
richer
and
statelier
then
you
reign
mother
of
men
whom
the
world
will
praise
and
your
sons
will
love
you
and
sigh
for
you
labor
and
battle
and
die
for
you
but
never
the
fondest
will
understand
the
way
we
have
loved
you
young
young
land
illustration
of
a
free
race
we
yearned
an
the
westerner
my
fathers
sleep
on
the
sunrise
plains
and
each
one
sleeps
alone
their
trails
may
dim
to
the
grass
and
rains
for
i
choose
to
make
my
own
i
lay
proud
claim
to
their
blood
and
name
but
i
lean
on
no
dead
kin
my
name
is
mine
for
the
praise
or
scorn
and
the
world
began
when
i
was
born
and
the
world
is
mine
to
win
they
built
high
towns
on
their
old
log
sills
where
the
great
slow
rivers
gleamed
but
with
new
live
rock
from
the
savage
hills
i
build
as
they
only
dreamed
the
smoke
scarce
dies
where
the
trail
camp
lies
till
the
rails
glint
down
the
pass
the
desert
springs
into
fruit
and
wheat
and
i
lay
the
stones
of
a
solid
street
over
yesterday
untrod
grass
i
waste
no
thought
on
my
neighbor
birth
or
the
way
he
makes
his
prayer
i
grant
him
a
white
man
room
on
earth
if
his
game
is
only
square
while
he
plays
it
straight
i
call
him
mate
if
he
cheats
i
drop
him
flat
old
class
and
rank
are
a
wornout
lie
for
all
clean
men
are
as
good
as
i
and
a
king
is
only
that
i
dream
no
dreams
of
a
state
that
will
spoon
me
out
my
food
a
stout
heart
sings
in
the
fray
with
fate
and
the
shock
and
sweat
are
good
from
noon
to
noon
all
the
earthly
boon
that
i
ask
my
god
to
spare
is
a
little
daily
bread
in
store
with
the
room
to
fight
the
strong
for
more
and
the
weak
shall
get
their
share
the
sunrise
plains
are
a
tender
haze
and
the
sunset
seas
are
gray
but
i
stand
here
where
the
bright
skies
blaze
over
me
and
the
big
today
what
good
to
me
is
a
vague
may
be
or
a
mournful
might
have
been
for
the
sun
wheels
swift
from
morn
to
morn
and
the
world
began
when
i
was
born
and
the
world
is
mine
to
win
the
wind
is
my
tired
hawse
nickers
for
his
own
home
bars
a
hoof
clicks
out
a
spark
the
dim
creek
flickers
to
the
lonesome
stars
the
trail
twists
down
the
dark
the
ridge
pines
whimper
to
the
pines
below
the
wind
is
blowin
and
i
want
you
so
the
birch
has
yellowed
since
i
saw
you
last
the
fall
haze
blued
the
creeks
the
big
pine
bellowed
as
the
snow
swished
past
but
still
above
the
peaks
the
same
stars
twinkle
that
we
used
to
know
the
wind
is
blowin
and
i
want
you
so
the
stars
up
yonder
wait
the
end
of
time
but
earth
fires
soon
go
black
i
trip
and
wander
on
the
trail
i
climb
a
fool
who
will
look
back
to
glimpse
a
fire
dead
a
year
ago
the
wind
is
blowin
and
i
want
you
so
who
says
the
lover
kills
the
man
in
me
beneath
the
day
hot
blue
this
thing
hunts
cover
and
my
heart
fights
free
to
laugh
an
hour
or
two
but
now
it
wavers
like
a
wounded
doe
the
wind
is
blowin
and
i
want
you
so
on
boot
hill
up
from
the
prairie
and
through
the
pines
over
your
straggling
headboard
lines
winds
of
the
west
go
by
you
must
love
them
you
booted
dead
more
than
the
dreamers
who
died
in
bed
you
who
took
your
lead
under
the
open
sky
leathery
knights
of
the
dim
old
trail
lawful
fighters
or
scamps
from
jail
dimly
your
virtues
shine
yet
who
am
i
that
i
judge
your
wars
deeds
that
my
daintier
soul
abhors
sins
of
the
wide
outdoors
manlier
sins
than
mine
dear
old
mavericks
customs
mend
i
would
not
glory
to
make
an
end
marked
like
a
homemade
sieve
but
with
a
touch
of
your
own
old
pride
grant
me
to
travel
the
trail
i
ride
gamely
and
gaily
the
way
you
died
give
me
the
nerve
to
live
ay
and
for
you
i
will
dare
assume
some
valhalla
of
sun
and
room
over
the
last
divide
there
in
eternally
fenceless
west
rest
to
your
souls
if
they
care
to
rest
or
else
fresh
horses
beyond
the
crest
and
a
range
to
ride
