acknowledgment
the
editor
is
most
grateful
to
the
various
authors
who
have
willingly
given
their
consent
to
the
use
of
their
respective
poems
in
the
compilation
of
this
volume
it
has
been
a
somewhat
difficult
problem
not
only
to
select
the
more
appropriate
productions
but
also
to
find
the
names
of
their
authors
for
in
his
lincoln
collection
there
are
many
hundreds
of
poems
which
have
appeared
from
time
to
time
in
magazines
newspapers
and
other
productions
some
of
which
are
accompanied
by
more
than
one
name
as
author
of
the
same
poem
in
a
number
of
instances
it
has
been
difficult
to
ascertain
the
name
of
the
actual
owner
of
the
copyright
the
poems
having
been
printed
in
so
many
forms
without
the
copyright
mark
attached
the
editor
in
particular
extends
his
grateful
acknowledgment

the

is
also
grateful
to
marion
mills
miller
for
his
contribution
of
the
introduction
and
a
poem
specially
written
for
the
collection
and
also
for
assistance
in
the
editorial
work
foreword
no
great
man
has
ever
been
spoken
of
with
such
tender
expressions
of
high
regard
as
has
been
abraham
lincoln
especially
is
this
true
of
the
tributes
of
esteem
made
by
the
poets
to
his
memory
it
is
therefore
desirable
that
these
should
be
preserved
for
future
generations
and
at
this
time
the
fiftieth
anniversary
of
his
untimely
death
it
is
peculiarly
proper
that
they
should
be
presented
to
the
public
although
they
are
chiefly
the
productions
of
american
authors
quite
a
number
are
from
the
pens
of
appreciative
citizens
of
other
countries
from
the
thousand
of
meritorious
poems
which
have
been
written
about
lincoln
the
compiler
after
serious
consideration
has
selected
those
within
as
appearing
to
be
gems
although
there
were
others
which
he
would
have
been
glad
to
include
if
space
permitted
the
poems
and
illustrations
are
arranged
largely
in
the
chronological
order
of
their
application
to
the
events
in
the
life
of
lincoln
the
intense
sympathy
and
warm
appreciation
portrayed
therein
for
our
martyred
president
as
well
as
their
artistic
merit
assure
the
poems
a
sacred
place
in
the
heart
of
every
patriotic
american
the
large
number
of
selected
portraits
and
illustrations
of
events
connected
with
his
life
service
death
and
burial
with
brief
sketches
of
authors
of
the
following
poems
also
forms
a
compilation
of
rich
material
for
all
readers
of
lincoln
literature
the
object
in
publishing
this
compilation
is
to
assist
in

the
collection
of

now
contained

the

by
marion

miller
see
biographical
sketch
on
page
some
years
ago
while
editing
henry
whitney
life
of
lincoln
i
showed
a
photograph
of
the
bust
of
lincoln
by
johannes
gelert
the
most
intellectual
to
my
mind
of
all
the
studies
of
his
face
to
a
little
italian
shoeblack
and
asked
him
if
he
knew
who
it
was
the
boy
evidently
prompted
by
a
recent
lesson
at
school
said
questioningly
whittier
longfellow
i
replied
no
it
is
lincoln
the
great
president
he
answered
well
he
looks
like
a
poet
anyway
this
verified
a
conclusion
to
which
i
had
already
come
lincoln
had
he
lived
in
a
region
of
greater
culture
such
as
new
england
might
not
have
adopted
the
engrossing
pursuits
of
law
and
politics
but
as
did
whittier
have
remained
longer
on
the
farm
and
gradually
taken
up
the
calling
of
letters
composing
verse
of
much
the
same
order
as
our
yankee
bards
and
poetry
of
even
higher
merit
than
some
produced
it
is
not
generally
known
that
lincoln
shortly
before
he
went
to
congress
wrote
verse
of
a
kind
to
compare
favorably
with
the
early
attempts
of
american
poets
such
as
those
named
thus
the
two
poems
of
his
which
have
been
preserved
for
his
early
lampoons
on
his
neighbors
have
happily
been
lost
are
equal
in
poetic
spirit
and
metrical
art
to
whittier
the
prisoner
for
debt
to
which
they
are
strikingly
similar
in
melancholic
mood
in
at
the
age
of
lincoln
conducted
a
literary
correspondence
with
a
friend
william
johnson
by
name
of
like
poetic
tastes
in
april
of
this
year
he
wrote
the
following
letter
to
johnson
tremont
april
friend
johnston
your
letter
written
some
six
weeks
since
was
received
in
due
course
and
also
the
paper
with
the
parody
it
is
true
as
suggested
it
might
be
that
i
have
never
seen
poe
raven
and
i
very
well
know
that
a
parody
is
almost
entirely
dependent
for
its
interest
upon
the
reader
acquaintance
with
the
original
still
there
is
enough
in
the
polecat
to
afford
one
several
hearty
laughs
i
think
four
or
five
of
the
last
stanzas
are
decidedly
funny
particularly
where
jeremiah
scrubbed
and
washed
and
prayed
and
fasted
i
have
not
your
letter
now
before
me
but
from
memory
i
think
you
ask
me
who
is
the
author
of
the
piece
i
sent
you
and
that
you
do
so
ask
as
to
indicate
a
slight
suspicion
that
i
myself
am
the
author
beyond
all
question
i
am
not
the
author
i
would
give
all
i
am
worth
and
go
in
debt
to
be
able
to
write
so
fine
a
piece
as
i
think
that
is
neither
do
i
know
who
is
the
author
i
met
it
in
a
straggling
form
in
a
newspaper
last
summer
and
i
remember
to
have
seen
it
once
before
about
fifteen
years
ago
and
this
is
all
i
know
about
it
the
piece
of
poetry
of
my
own
which
i
alluded
to
i
was
led
to
write
under
the
following
circumstances
in
the
fall
of
thinking
i
might
aid
some
to
carry
the
state
of
indiana
for
clay
i
went
into
the
neighborhood
in
that
state
in
which
i
was
raised
where
my
mother
and
only
sister
were
buried
and
from
which
i
had
been
absent
about
fifteen
years
that
part
of
the
country
is
within
itself
as
unpoetical
as
any
spot
of
the
earth
but
still
seeing
it
and
its
objects
and
inhabitants
aroused
feelings
in
me
which
were
certainly
poetry
though
whether
my
expression
of
those
feelings
is
poetry
is
quite
another
question
when
i
got
to
writing
the
change
of
subject
divided
the
thing
into
four
little
divisions
or
cantos
the
first
only
of
which
i
send
you
now
and
may
send
the
others
hereafter
yours
truly
lincoln
my
childhood
home
i
see
again
and
sadden
with
the
view
and
still
as
memory
crowds
my
brain
there
pleasure
in
it
too
o
memory
thou
midway
world
earth
and
paradise
where
things
decayed
and
loved
ones
lost
in
dreamy
shadows
rise
and
freed
from
all
that
earthly
vile
seem
hallowed
pure
and
bright
like
scenes
in
some
enchanted
isle
all
bathed
in
liquid
light
as
dusky
mountains
please
the
eye
when
twilight
chases
day
as
that
passing
by
in
distance
die
away
as
leaving
some
grand
waterfall
we
lingering
list
its
roar
so
memory
will
hallow
all
we
known
but
know
no
more
near
twenty
years
have
passed
away
since
here
i
bid
farewell
to
woods
and
fields
and
scenes
of
play
and
playmates
loved
so
well
where
many
were
but
few
remain
of
old
familiar
things
but
seeing
them
to
mind
again
the
lost
and
absent
brings
the
friends
i
left
that
parting
day
how
changed
as
time
has
sped
young
childhood
grown
strong
manhood
gray
and
half
of
all
are
dead
i
hear
the
loved
survivors
tell
how
nought
from
death
could
save
till
every
sound
appears
a
knell
and
every
spot
a
grave
i
range
the
fields
with
pensive
tread
and
pace
the
hollow
rooms
and
feel
companion
of
the
dead
i
living
in
the
tombs
in
september
he
wrote
the
following
letter
springfield
september
friend
johnston
you
remember
when
i
wrote
you
from
tremont
last
spring
sending
you
a
little
canto
of
what
i
called
poetry
i
promised
to
bore
you
with
another
some
time
i
now
fulfil
the
promise
the
subject
of
the
present
one
is
an
insane
man
his
name
is
matthew
gentry
he
is
three
years
older
than
i
and
when
we
were
boys
we
went
to
school
together
he
was
rather
a
bright
lad
and
the
son
of
the
rich
man
of
a
very
poor
neighborhood
at
the
age
of
nineteen
he
unaccountably
became
furiously
mad
from
which
condition
he
gradually
settled
down
into
harmless
insanity
when
as
i
told
you
in
my
other
letter
i
visited
my
old
home
in
the
fall
of
i
found
him
still
lingering
in
this
wretched
condition
in
my
poetizing
mood
i
could
not
forget
the
impression
his
case
made
upon
me
here
is
the
result
but
here
an
object
more
of
dread
than
aught
the
grave
contains
a
human
form
with
reason
fled
while
wretched
life
remains
when
terror
spread
and
neighbors
ran
your
dangerous
strength
to
bind
and
soon
a
howling
crazy
man
your
limbs
were
fast
confined
how
then
you
strove
and
shrieked
aloud
your
bones
and
sinews
bared
and
fiendish
on
the
gazing
crowd
with
burning
eyeballs
glared
and
begged
and
swore
and
wept
and
prayed
with
maniac
laughter
joined
how
fearful
were
these
signs
displayed
by
pangs
that
killed
the
mind
and
when
at
length
the
drear
and
long
time
soothed
thy
fiercer
woes
how
plaintively
thy
mournful
song
upon
the
still
night
rose
i
heard
it
oft
as
if
i
dreamed
far
distant
sweet
and
lone
the
funeral
dirge
it
ever
seemed
of
reason
dead
and
gone
to
drink
its
strains
i
stole
away
all
stealthily
and
still
ere
yet
the
rising
god
of
day
had
streaked
the
eastern
hill
air
held
her
breath
trees
with
the
spell
seemed
sorrowing
angels
round
whose
swelling
tears
in
dewdrops
fell
upon
the
listening
ground
but
this
is
past
and
naught
remains
that
raised
thee
the
brute
thy
piercing
shrieks
and
soothing
strains
are
like
forever
mute
now
fare
thee
well
more
thou
the
cause
than
subject
now
of
woe
all
mental
pangs
by
time
kind
laws
hast
lost
the
power
to
know
o
death
thou
prince
that
keepst
the
world
in
fear
why
dost
thou
tear
more
blest
ones
hence
and
leave
him
lingering
here
if
i
should
ever
send
another
the
subject
will
be

lincoln
the
poem
alluded
to
in
the
first
letter
is
undoubtedly
oh
why
should
the
spirit
of
mortal
be
proud
by
william
knox
a
scottish
poet
known
to
fame
only
by
its
authorship
it
remained
the
favorite
of
lincoln
until
his
death
being
frequently
alluded
to
by
him
in
conversation
with
his
friends
because
it
so
aptly
presents
own
spirit
it
is
here
presented
in
full
during
his
presidency
he
said
there
is
a
poem
which
has
been
a
great
favorite
with
me
for
years
which
was
first
shown
me
when
a
young
man
by
a
friend
and
which
i
afterwards
saw
and
cut
from
a
newspaper
and
learned
by
heart
i
would
give
a
good
deal
to
know
who
wrote
it
but
i
have
never
been
able
to
ascertain
then
half
closing
his
eyes
he
repeated
the
verses
oh
why
should
the
spirit
of
mortal
be
proud
by
william
knox
william
knox
was
born
at
firth
in
the
parish
of
lilliesleaf
in
the
county
of
roxburghshire
on
the
of
august
from
his
early
youth
he
composed
verses
he
merited
the
attention
of
sir
walter
scott
who
afforded
him
pecuniary
assistance
he
died
november
at
the
age
of
oh
why
should
the
spirit
of
mortal
be
proud
like
a
meteor
a
cloud
the
flash
of
the
lightning
a
break
of
the
wave
he
passes
from
life
to
his
rest
in
the
grave
the
leaves
of
the
oak
and
the
willow
shall
fade
be
scattered
around
and
together
be
laid
and
the
young
and
the
old
and
the
low
and
the
high
shall
molder
to
dust
and
together
shall
lie
the
infant
a
mother
attended
and
loved
the
mother
that
infant
affection
who
proved
the
husband
that
mother
and
infant
who
blest
each
all
are
away
to
their
dwellings
of
rest
the
maid
on
whose
cheek
on
whose
brow
in
whose
eye
shone
beauty
and
pleasure
her
triumphs
are
by
and
the
of
those
who
loved
her
and
praised
are
alike
from
the
minds
of
the
living
erased
the
hand
of
the
king
that
the
scepter
hath
borne
the
brow
of
the
priest
that
the
miter
hath
worn
the
eye
of
the
sage
and
the
heart
of
the
brave
are
hidden
and
lost
in
the
depths
of
the
grave
the
peasant
whose
lot
was
to
sow
and
to
reap
the
herdsman
who
climbed
with
his
goats
up
the
steep
the
beggar
who
wandered
in
search
of
his
bread
have
faded
away
like
the
grass
that
we
tread
the
saint
who
enjoyed
the
communion
of
heaven
the
sinner
who
dared
to
remain
unforgiven
the
wise
and
the
foolish
the
guilty
and
just
have
quietly
mingled
their
bones
in
the
dust
so
the
multitude
goes
like
the
flower
or
the
weed
that
withers
away
to
let
others
succeed
so
the
multitude
comes
even
those
we
behold
to
repeat
every
tale
that
has
often
been
told
for
we
are
the
same
that
our
fathers
have
been
we
see
the
same
sights
our
fathers
have
seen
we
drink
the
same
streams
and
view
the
same
sun
and
run
the
same
course
our
fathers
have
run
the
thoughts
we
are
thinking
our
fathers
would
think
from
the
death
we
are
shrinking
our
fathers
would
shrink
to
the
life
we
are
clinging
they
also
would
cling
but
it
speeds
from
us
all
like
a
bird
on
the
wing
they
loved
but
the
story
we
can
not
unfold
they
scorned
but
the
heart
of
the
haughty
is
cold
they
grieved
but
no
wail
from
their
slumber
will
come
they
joyed
but
the
tongue
of
their
gladness
is
dumb
they
died
ay
they
died
we
things
that
are
now
that
walk
on
the
turf
that
lies
over
their
brow
and
make
in
their
dwellings
a
transient
abode
meet
the
things
that
they
met
on
their
pilgrimage
road
yea
hope
and
despondency
pleasure
and
pain
are
mingled
together
in
sunshine
and
rain
and
the
smile
and
the
tear
the
song
and
the
dirge
still
follow
each
other
like
surge
upon
surge
is
the
wink
of
an
eye
is
the
draught
of
a
breath
from
the
blossom
of
health
to
the
paleness
of
death
from
the
gilded
salon
to
the
bier
and
the
shroud
oh
why
should
the
spirit
of
mortal
be
proud
the
last
leaf
by
oliver
wendell
holmes
was
also
a
favorite
poem
of
lincoln
says
henry
whitney
his
friend
and
biographer
in
his
life
of
lincoln
vol
i
page
over
and
over
again
i
have
heard
him
repeat
the
mossy
marbles
rest
on
the
lips
that
he
has
prest
in
their
bloom
and
the
names
he
loved
to
hear
have
been
carved
for
many
a
year
on
the
tomb
and
tears
would
come
unbidden
to
his
eyes
probably
at
thought
of
the
grave
his
mother
at
gentryville
or
that
in
the
bend
of
the
sangamo
of
ann
rutledge
his
first
love
who
died
shortly
before
the
time
set
for
their
wedding
and
whose
memory
lincoln
ever
kept
sacred
while
lincoln
so
far
as
can
be
ascertained
wrote
nothing
in
verse
after
he
developed
in
his
speeches
a
literary
style
which
is
poetical
in
the
highest
sense
of
that
term
more
than
all
american
statesmen
his
utterances
and
writings
possess
that
classic
quality
whose
supreme
expression
is
found
in
greek
literature
this
is
because
lincoln
had
an
essentially
hellenic
mind
first
of
all
the
architecture
of
his
thought
was
that
of
the
greek
masters
who
whether
as
phidias
they
built
the
parthenon
to
crown
with
harmonious
beauty
the
acropolis
or
as
homer
they
recorded
in
swelling
narrative
from
its
dramatic
beginning
the
strife
of
the
achaeans
before
troy
or
even
as
euclid
they
developed
from
postulates
the
relations
of
space
had
a
deep
insight
into
the
order
in
which
mother
nature
was
striving
to
express
herself
and
a
reverent
impulse
to
aid
her
in
bodying
forth
according
to
her
methods
the
ideal
forms
of
the
cosmos
the
world
of
beauty
no
less
within
the
soul
of
man
than
without
it
which
was
intended
by
such
help
to
be
realized
as
a
whole
in
the
infinity
of
time
and
in
part
in
the
vision
of
every
true
workman
in
short
lincoln
had
a
profound
sense
of
the
fitness
of
things
that
which
aristotle
the
scientific
analyst
of
human
thought
and
the
philosopher
of
its
proper
expression
called
poetic
justice
he
strove
to
make
his
reasoning
processes
strictly
logical
and
to
this
end
carried
with
him
as
he
rode
the
legal
circuit
not
but
a
copy
of
geometry
and
passed
his
time
on
the
way
demonstrating
to
his
drivers
the
theorems
therein
proposed
demonstrate
he
said
he
considered
to
be
the
greatest
word
in
the
english
language
he
constructed
every
one
of
his
later
speeches
on
the
plan
of
a
euclidean
solution
his
cooper
union
speech
on
slavery
as
the
fathers
viewed
it
which
contributed
so
largely
to
his
presidential
nomination
was
such
a
demonstration
settling
what
was
thereafter
never
attempted
to
be
controverted
his
contention
that
the
makers
of
the
constitution
merely
tolerated
property
in
human
flesh
and
blood
as
a
primitive
and
passing
phase
of
civilization
and
never
intended
that
it
should
be
perpetuated
by
the
charter
of
the
republic
so
too
the
gettysburg
speech
brief
as
it
is
is
the
statement
of
a
thesis
the
principles
upon
which
the
fathers
founded
the
nation
and
of
the
heroic
demonstration
of
the
same
by
the
soldiers
fallen
on
the
field
and
the
addition
of
a
moral
corollary
of
this
the
high
resolve
of
the
living
to
prosecute
the
work
until
the
vision
of
the
fathers
was
realized
in
substance
of
thought
and
in
form
of
its
presentation
the
speech
is
as
perfect
a
poem
as
ever
was
written
and
even
in
the
minor
qualities
of
artistic
language
rhythm
and
cadence
phonetic
euphony
rhetorical
symbolism
and
that
subtle
reminiscence
of
a
great
literary
and
spiritual
inheritance
the
bible
which
stands
to
us
as
homer
did
to
the
ancients
it
excels
the
finest
gem
to
be
found
in
poetic
cabinets
from
the
greek
anthology
downward
only
because
it
was
not
written
in
the
typography
of
verse
with
capitalized
and
paragraphed
initial
words
at
the
beginning
of
each
of
words
has
it
failed
of
recognition
as
a
poem
by
academic
minds
had
walt
whitman
composed
the
address
and
printed
it
in
the
above
manner
it
would
now
appear
in
every
anthology
of
poetry
published
since
its
date
to
convince
of
this
those
conventional
people
who
must
have
an
ocular
demonstration
of
form
in
order
to
compare
the
address
with
accepted
examples
of
poetry
i
will
dare
to
incur
the
condemnation
of
those
who
rightly
look
upon
such
a
departure
from
lincoln
own
manner
of
writing
the
speech
as
profanation
and
present
it
in
the
shape
of
for
the
latter
class
of
readers
this
the
greatest
poem
by
lincoln
the
greatest
indeed
yet
produced
in
america
may
be
preferably
read
in
the
original
form
on
page
of
this
collection
i
trust
that
these
especially
if
they
are
teachers
of
literature
will
pardon
for
the
sake
of
others
less
cultivated
in
poetic
taste
what
may
appear
a
duplication
here
unnecessary
to
themselves
of
the
address
speech
at
gettysburg
by
abraham
lincoln
four
score
and
seven
years
ago
our
fathers
brought
forth
on
this
continent
a
new
nation
conceived
in
liberty
and
dedicated
to
the
proposition
that
all
men
are
created
equal
now
we
are
engaged
in
a
great
civil
war
testing
whether
that
nation
or
any
nation
so
conceived
and
so
dedicated
can
long
endure
we
are
met
on
a
great
of
that
war
we
have
come
to
dedicate
a
portion
of
that
field
as
a
final
for
those
who
here
gave
their
lives
that
that
nation
might
live
it
is
altogether
fitting
and
proper
that
we
should
do
this
but
in
a
larger
sense
we
can
not
dedicate
we
can
not
consecrate
we
can
not
hallow
this
ground
the
brave
men
living
and
dead
who
struggled
here
have
consecrated
it
far
above
our
poor
power
to
add
or
detract
the
world
will
little
note
nor
long
remember
what
we
say
here
but
it
can
never
forget
what
they
did
here
it
is
for
us
the
living
rather
to
be
dedicated
here
to
the
unfinished
work
which
they
who
fought
here
have
so
nobly
advanced
it
is
rather
for
us
to
be
here
dedicated
to
the
great
task
remaining
before
us
that
from
these
honored
dead
we
take
increased
devotion
to
that
cause
for
which
they
gave
the
last
full
measure
of
devotion
that
we
here
highly
resolve
that
these
dead
shall
not
have
died
in
vain
that
this
nation
under
god
shall
have
a
new
birth
of
freedom
and
that
government
of
the
people
by
the
people
and
for
the
people
shall
not
perish
from
the
earth
lincoln
attained
this
classic
perfection
of
ordered
thought
and
with
it
as
an
inevitable
accompaniment
this
classic
beauty
of
expression
only
by
great
struggle
he
became
a
poet
of
the
first
rank
only
by
virtue
of
his
moral
spirit
he
was
continually
correcting
deficiencies
in
his
character
which
were
far
greater
than
is
generally
received
owing
to
the
tendency
of
american
historians
of
the
tribe
of
parson
weems
to
find
by
force
illustrations
of
moral
heroism
in
the
youth
of
our
great
men
thus
lincoln
is
represented
as
a
noble
lad
who
having
allowed
a
borrowed
book
to
be
ruined
by
rain
went
to
the
owner
and
offered
to
pull
fodder
to
repay
him
which
the
man
ungenerously
permitted
him
to
do
the
truth
is
that
the
neighbor
to
whom
the
book
was
a
cherished
possession
required
him
to
do
the
work
in
repayment
and
that
lincoln
not
only
did
it
grudgingly
but
afterwards
lampooned
the
man
so
severely
in
satiric
verse
that
he
was
ashamed
to
show
himself
at
neighborhood
gatherings
all
the
people
about
gentryville
feared
lincoln
caustic
wit
and
disliked
him
for
it
although
they
were
greatly
impressed
with
his
ability
exhibited
thereby
lincoln
recognized
his
moral
obliquity
and
curbed
his
propensity
for
satire
which
was
a
case
of
that
exercise
of
natural
faculty
which
affects
all
gifted
persons
and
when
he
left
that
region
he
visited
all
the
neighbors
and
asked
pardon
of
those
whom
he
had
ridiculed
the
true
lincoln
is
a
far
better
example
to
boys
than
the
fictitious
one
in
that
he
had
more
unlovely
traits
at
first
than
the
average
lad
yet
he
reformed
with
the
result
that
when
he
went
to
new
scenes
he
speedily
became
the
most
popular
young
man
in
the
neighborhood
he
was
one
of
those
who
rise
on
stepping
stones
of
their
dead
selves
to
higher
things
the
reformation
of
his
character
by
self
examination
and
determination
not
to
make
the
same
mistake
again
seems
to
have
induced
similar
effects
and
methods
for
their
attainment
in
the
case
of
his
intellectual
development
whatever
the
connection
both
regenerations
proceeded
apace
lincoln
at
first
was
a
shallow
thinker
accepting
without
examination
the
views
of
others
especially
popular
statesmen
such
as
henry
clay
whose
magnetic
personality
was
drawing
to
himself
the
young
men
of
the
west
some
of
the
political
doctrines
which
lincoln
then
adopted
he
retained
to
the
end
these
being
on
subjects
such
as
taxation
and
finance
whose
moral
bearing
was
not
apparent
and
therefore
into
which
he
never
inquired
closely
for
lincoln
mind
could
not
be
profoundly
interested
in
any
save
a
moral
question
when
he
found
that
a
revered
statesman
was
weak
upon
a
crucial
moral
issue
he
repressed
his
innate
tendency
to
loyalty
and
rejected
him
thus
after
a
visit
to
henry
clay
in
kentucky
when
the
slavery
question
was
arising
to
vex
the
country
despite
the
efforts
the
aged
statesman
had
made
to
settle
it
by
the
compromise
of
lincoln
returned
disillusioned
having
found
that
the
light
he
himself
possessed
on
the
subject
was
clearer
than
that
of
his
old
leader
the
eulogy
which
he
delivered
on
the
death
of
clay
which
occurred
shortly
afterward
in
is
the
most
perfunctory
of
all
his
addresses
indeed
not
till
the
time
of
the
repeal
of
the
missouri
compromise
of
which
brought
lincoln
back
into
politics
by
its
overthrow
of
what
he
regarded
as
the
constitutional
exclusion
of
slavery
from
the
territories
did
he
rise
to
his
highest
powers
as
a
thinker
and
speaker
lincoln
had
been
defeated
for
reelection
to
congress
because
of
his
opposition
though
not
highly
moral
in
character
to
the
popular
mexican
war
and
regarding
himself
as
a
political
failure
he
had
devoted
himself
to
law
his
most
notable
speech
in
the
house
of
representatives
a
well
composed
satirical
arraignment
of
president
polk
for
throwing
the
country
into
war
had
failed
utterly
of
its
intended
effect
probably
because
of
its
trimming
partisan
tone
in
he
was
relieved
of
the
trammels
of
party
the
whigs
having
gone
to
smash
had
become
a
great
moral
movement
and
he
was
drawn
into
its
current
almost
at
once
he
became
its
western
leader
his
speech
against
the
repeal
of
the
missouri
compromise
which
had
been
effected
by
his
inveterate
antagonist
senator
stephen
douglas
was
his
first
classic
achievement
in
argumentative
oratory
while
in
the
greater
aspect
of
artistic
composition
the
form
of
the
address
as
a
whole
his
master
was
euclid
in
minor
points
the
influence
of
shakespeare
of
whom
lincoln
had
become
a
great
reader
was
apparent
as
indicated
by
a
quotation
from
the
dramatist
and
an
application
to
senator
douglas
of
the
scene
of
lady
macbeth
trying
to
wash
out
the
indelible
stain
upon
her
hand
also
the
bible
was
the
source
of
strong
and
telling
phrases
and
figures
of
speech
thus
he
denominated
slavery
as
the
great
behemoth
of
danger
and
asked
shall
the
strong
grip
of
the
nation
be
loosened
upon
him
to
intrust
him
to
the
hands
of
his
feeble
keepers
and
in
the
following
passage
characteristic
of
the
new
lincoln
i
think
that
either
shakespeare
and
the
bible
had
combined
to
inspire
him
with
graphic
description
of
character
and
moral
indignation
or
they
enforced
these
native
powers
again
you
have
among
you
a
sneaking
individual
of
the
class
of
native
tyrants
known
as
the
he
watches
your
necessities
and
crawls
up
to
buy
your
slave
at
a
speculative
price
if
you
can
not
help
it
you
sell
to
him
but
if
you
can
help
it
you
drive
him
from
your
door
you
despise
him
utterly
you
do
not
recognize
him
as
a
friend
or
even
as
an
honest
man
your
children
must
not
play
with
his
they
may
rollick
freely
with
the
little
negroes
but
not
with
the
children
if
you
are
obliged
to
deal
with
him
you
try
to
get
through
the
job
without
so
much
as
touching
him
it
is
common
with
you
to
join
hands
with
the
men
you
meet
but
with
the
you
avoid
the
ceremony
instinctively
shrinking
from
the
snaky
contact
of
lincoln
critical
appreciation
of
shakespeare

artist
of
the
first

of
the
emancipation
proclamation
see

on
page
writes
in
his
six
months
at
the
white
house
with
abraham
lincoln
as
follows
presently
the
conversation
turned
upon
shakspeare
of
whom
it
is
well
known
lincoln
was
very
fond
he
once
remarked
matters
not
to
me
whether
shakspeare
be
well
or
ill
acted
with
him
the
thought
suffices
edwin
booth
was
playing
an
engagement
at
this
time
at
grover
theatre
he
had
been
announced
for
the
coming
evening
in
his
famous
part
of
the
president
had
never
witnessed
his
representation
of
this
character
and
he
proposed
being
present
the
mention
of
this
play
which
i
afterward
learned
had
at
all
times
a
peculiar
charm
for
lincoln
mind
waked
up
a
train
of
thought
i
was
not
prepared
for
said
he
and
his
words
have
often
returned
to
me
with
a
sad
interest
since
his
own
assassination
is
one
passage
of
the
play
of
hamlet
which
is
very
apt
to
be
slurred
over
by
the
actor
or
omitted
altogether
which
seems
to
me
the
choicest
part
of
the
play
it
is
the
soliloquy
of
the
king
after
the
murder
it
always
struck
me
as
one
of
the
finest
touches
of
nature
in
the
world
then
throwing
himself
into
the
very
spirit
of
the
scene
he
took
up
the
words
my
offence
is
rank
it
smells
to
heaven
it
hath
the
primal
eldest
curse
upo
a
brother
murder
pray
can
i
not
though
inclination
be
as
sharp
as
will
my
stronger
guilt
defeats
my
strong
intent
and
like
a
man
to
double
business
bound
i
stand
in
pause
where
i
shall
first
begin
and
both
neglect
what
if
this
cursed
hand
were
thicker
than
itself
with
brother
blood
is
there
not
rain
enough
in
the
sweet
heavens
to
wash
it
white
as
snow
whereto
serves
mercy
but
to
confront
the
visage
of
offence
and
what
in
prayer
but
this
twofold
force
to
be
forestalled
ere
we
come
to
fall
or
pardoned
being
down
then
i
look
up
my
fault
is
past
but
o
what
form
of
prayer
can
serve
my
turn
forgive
me
my
foul
murder
that
can
not
be
since
i
am
still
possessed
of
those
effects
for
which
i
did
the
murder
my
crown
my
own
ambition
and
my
queen
may
one
be
pardoned
and
retain
the
offence
in
the
corrupted
currents
of
this
world
offence
gilded
hand
may
shove
by
justice
and
oft
is
seen
the
wicked
prize
itself
buys
out
the
law
but
is
not
so
there
is
no
shuffling
there
the
action
lies
in
its
true
nature
and
we
ourselves
compelled
even
to
the
teeth
and
forehead
of
our
faults
to
give
in
evidence
what
then
what
rests
try
what
repentance
can
what
can
it
not
yet
what
can
it
when
one
can
not
repent
o
wretched
state
o
bosom
black
as
death
o
bruised
soul
that
struggling
to
be
free
art
more
engaged
help
angels
make
assay
bow
stubborn
knees
and
heart
with
strings
of
steel
be
soft
as
sinews
of
the
babe
all
may
be
well
he
repeated
this
entire
passage
from
memory
with
a
feeling
and
appreciation
unsurpassed
by
anything
i
ever
witnessed
upon
the
stage
remaining
in
thought
for
a
few
moments
he
continued
opening
of
the
play
of
king
richard
the
third
seems
to
me
often
entirely
misapprehended
it
is
quite
common
for
an
actor
to
come
upon
the
stage
and
in
a
sophomoric
style
to
begin
with
a
flourish
is
the
winter
of
our
discontent
made
glorious
summer
by
this
sun
of
york
and
all
the
clouds
that
lowered
upon
our
house
in
the
deep
bosom
of
the
ocean
buried
said
he
is
all
wrong
richard
you
remember
had
been
and
was
then
plotting
the
destruction
of
his
brothers
to
make
room
for
himself
outwardly
the
most
loyal
to
the
newly
crowned
king
secretly
he
could
scarcely
contain
his
impatience
at
the
obstacles
still
in
the
way
of
his
own
elevation
he
appears
upon
the
stage
just
after
the
crowning
of
edward
burning
with
repressed
hate
and
jealousy
the
prologue
is
the
utterance
of
the
most
intense
bitterness
and
satire
then
unconsciously
assuming
the
character
lincoln
repeated
also
from
memory
richard
soliloquy
rendering
it
with
a
degree
of
force
and
power
that
made
it
seem
like
a
new
creation
to
me
though
familiar
with
the
passage
from
boyhood
i
can
truly
say
that
never
till
that
moment
had
i
fully
appreciated
its
spirit
i
could
not
refrain
from
laying
down
my
palette
and
brushes
and
applauding
heartily
upon
his
conclusion
saying
at
the
same
time
half
in
earnest
that
i
was
not
sure
but
that
he
had
made
a
mistake
in
the
choice
of
a
profession
considerably
as
may
be
imagined
to
his
amusement
sinclair
has
since
repeatedly
said
to
me
that
he
never
heard
these
choice
passages
of
shakspeare
rendered
with
more
effect
by
the
most
famous
of
modern
actors
lincoln
sense
of
the
classic
phrase
seems
to
have
been
native
with
him
for
we
find
it
in
his
earliest
utterances
such
a
phrase
appears
in
homely
proverbial
form
in
his
first
speech
my
politics
are
short
and
sweet
like
the
old
woman
dance
impaired
in
rhythm
of
thought
and
sound
by
an
awkward
though
logical
parenthetical
expression
another
phrase
stands
out
in
a
passage
from
his
first
formal
address
that
on
the
perpetuation
of
our
political
institutions
all
the
armies
of
europe
asia
and
africa
combined
with
all
the
treasure
of
earth
our
own
excepted
in
its
military
chest
with
a
bonaparte
for
a
commander
could
not
by
force
a
drink
from
the
ohio
or
make
a
track
on
the
blue
in
a
trial
of
a
thousand
years
and
in
a
eulogy
on
washington
lincoln
early
achieved
a
line
which
in
phonetic
quality
rhetorical
figure
and
rhythmic
cadence
is
pure
poetry
though
not
of
an
exceptional
order
in
solemn
awe
we
pronounce
the
name
and
in
its
naked
deathless
splendor
leave
it
shining
on
in
an
article
entitled
lincoln
literary
experiments
by
john
nicolay
one
of
lincoln
two
private
secretaries
which
was
published
in
the
century
magazine
for
april
are
reproduced
notes
of
one
lyceum
lecture
on
niagara
falls
and
the
text
of
another
on
discoveries
inventions
and
improvements
these
however
detract
if
anything
from
lincoln
reputation
as
a
writer
for
in
choice
of
subjects
and
in
style
of
treatment
there
is
seen
an
almost
discreditable
stooping
of
a
man
of
genius
even
in
his
function
of
teacher
to
the
low
popular
taste
of
the
west
at
the
time
in
the
first
lecture
lincoln
presented
the
statistics
of
the
water
power
of
niagara
falls
for
each
minute
and
led
his
hearers
from
this
base
to
the
contemplation
of
the
vast
power
the
sun
is
constantly
exerting
in
the
quiet
noiseless
operation
of
lifting
water
up
to
be
rained
down
again
yet
at
this
point
he
stopped
short
of
his
duty
as
an
educator
for
he
made
no
suggestion
as
to
the
utilization
of
this
power
he
was
satisfied
with
giving
the
people
what
they
had
come
for
the
pleasant
excitation
of
a
mental
faculty
that
of
the
imagination
in
its
primary
form
of
wonder
at
the
grandeur
of
the
material
universe
in
short
he
was
acting
as
a
mere
entertainer
as
so
many
of
our
public
men
do
now
at
chautauquas
in
the
second
lecture
he
performed
this
function
in
a
still
more
discreditable
manner
by
catering
to
the
unworthy
demand
of
his
hearers
for
obvious
and
familiar
humorous
conceptions
to
grasp
which
would
cause
them
no
mental
exertion
thus
in
speaking
of
the
inventions
of
the
locomotive
and
telegraph
already
old
enough
for
the
first
inevitable
similitudes
and
jocose
remarks
about
them
to
be
current
he
said
the
iron
horse
is
panting
and
impatient
to
carry
him
man
everywhere
in
no
time
and
the
lightning
stands
ready
harnessed
to
take
and
bring
his
tidings
in
a
trifle
less
than
no
time
this
reveals
lincoln
taste
for
the
characteristic
american
humor
of
exaggeration
which
was
later
to
afford
him
relief
from
the
stress
and
strain
of
his
duties
as
president
in
the
works
of
petroleum
nasby
and
artemus
ward
writers
however
with
a
quaint
originality
which
lifted
them
and
their
admirers
above
the
plane
of
humorous
composition
and
appreciation
of
the
preceding
decade
indeed
lincoln
developed
his
own
power
of
witty
expression
to
a
degree
excelling
that
of
the
writers
he
admired
and
in
quality
of
product
if
not
in
quantity
for
the
greater
part
of
the
funny
stories
attributed
to
him
thank
heaven
are
apocryphal
he
stands
in
the
front
rank
of
the
american
humorists
of
his
generation
and
as
the
poet
and
the
wit
are
near
akin
through
this
common
appeal
to
the
imagination
lincoln
had
he
overcome
the
obsession
of
melancholy
in
his
nature
which
was
the
mood
in
which
he
resorted
to
poetry
and
which
early
limited
his
taste
for
it
to
verse
of
a
sad
and
reflective
kind
might
have
become
a
literary
craftsman
of
the
order
of
holmes
whose
poetry
in
the
main
was
bright
and
joyous
and
even
when
he
occasionally
touched
upon
such
subjects
as
death
was
as
we
have
seen
informed
with
inspiring
hellenic
beauty
rather
than
depressing
hebraic
moralization
it
was
in
his
sad
moments
says
henry
whitney
that
the
mind
of
lincoln
gravitated
toward
the
weird
sombre
and
mystical
in
his
normal
and
tranquil
state
of
mind
last
leaf
by
oliver
wendell
holmes
was
his
favorite
poem
it
was
lincoln
happy
lot
to
rise
in
the
realm
of
oratory
by
the
power
of
his
poetic
spirit
higher
than
any
american
save
probably
emerson
has
done
in
other
fields
of
literature
on
the
theme
of
slavery
where
his
unerring
moral
sense
had
free
sway
he
became
our
supreme
orator
transcending
even
webster
in
grandeur
of
thought
and
beauty
of
its
expression
his
periods
are
not
as
sonorous
as
the
olympian
new
england
orator
but
their
accents
will
reach
as
far
and
resound
even
longer
by
the
carrying
and
sustaining
power
of
the
ideas
which
they
express
indeed
it
is
on
the
wings
supplied
by
lincoln
that
most
significant
conception
that
of
the
nature
of
the
constitution
is
even
now
borne
along
because
of
the
uplifting
ideality
which
lincoln
gave
it
by
more
broadly
applying
it
to
the
nation
itself
as
an
examplar
and
preserver
to
the
world
of
ideal
government
webster
said
it
is
sir
the
people
constitution
the
government
made
for
the
people
made
by
the
people
and
answerable
to
the
people
this
he
made
the
thesis
for
an
argument
which
was
to
be
followed
by
a
magnificent
peroration
ending
with
a
sentiment
calculated
for
use
as
a
toast
at
political
banquets
and
as
a
patriotic
slogan
liberty
and
union
now
and
forever
one
and
inseparable
lincoln
with
purer
taste
the
expression
of
which
be
it
said
to
webster
credit
had
been
made
possible
by
the
acceptance
of
the
earlier
statesman
contention
assumed
the
thesis
as
placed
beyond
all
controversy
and
making
it
the
exhortation
of
his
speech
gave
to
it
the
character
of
a
sacred
adjuration
that
we
here
highly
resolve
that
government
of
the
people
by
the
people
and
for
the
people
shall
not
perish
from
the
earth
another
example
of
lincoln
ability
to
improve
the
composition
of
another
writer
is
the
closing
paragraph
of
his
first
inaugural
address
the
had
submitted
the
manuscript
of
this
most
important
speech
which
would
be
universally
scrutinized
to
find
what
policy
he
would
adopt
toward
the
seceded
states
to
seward
his
chosen
secretary
of
state
for
criticism
and
suggestion
seward
approved
the
argument
but
advised
the
addition
of
a
closing
paragraph
to
meet
and
remove
prejudice
and
passion
in
the
south
and
despondency
in
the
east
he
submitted
two
paragraphs
of
his
own
as
alternative
models
the
second
was
in
that
poetic
vein
which
occasionally
cropped
out
in
seward
speeches
and
over
which
lincoln
on
better
acquaintance
was
wont
to
rally
him
it
is
evidence
of
predilection
for
poetic
language
at
least
at
the
close
of
a
speech
that
he
adopted
the
latter
paragraph
it
ran
i
close
we
are
not
we
must
not
be
aliens
or
enemies
but
and
brethren
although
passion
has
strained
our
bonds
of
affection
too
hardly
they
must
not
i
am
sure
they
will
not
be
broken
the
mystic
chords
which
proceeding
from
so
many
battlefields
and
so
many
patriot
graves
pass
through
all
the
hearts
and
all
hearths
in
this
broad
continent
of
ours
will
yet
again
harmonize
in
their
ancient
music
when
breathed
upon
by
the
guardian
angel
of
the
nation
lincoln
by
deft
touches
which
reveal
a
literary
taste
beyond
that
of
any
statesman
of
his
time
indeed
beyond
that
which
he
himself
had
yet
exhibited
transformed
this
passage
into
his
peroration
his
emendations
were
largely
in
the
way
of
excision
of
unnecessary
phrases
resolution
of
sentences
broken
in
construction
into
several
shorter
more
direct
ones
and
change
of
general
and
vague
terms
in
rhetorical
figure
to
concrete
and
picturesque
words
he
wrote
i
am
loth
to
close
we
are
not
enemies
but
friends
we
must
not
be
enemies
though
passion
may
have
strained
it
must
not
break
our
bonds
of
affection
the
mystic
chords
of
memory
stretching
from
every
and
patriot
grave
to
every
living
heart
and
all
over
this
broad
land
will
yet
swell
the
chorus
of
the
union
when
again
touched
as
surely
they
will
be
by
the
better
angels
of
our
nature
more
than
the
persuasive
argument
and
gentle
yet
determined
spirit
of
the
address
it
was
the
chaste
beauty
and
tender
feeling
of
these
closing
words
which
convinced
the
people
that
lincoln
measured
up
to
the
high
mental
and
moral
stature
demanded
of
one
who
was
to
be
their
leader
through
the
most
critical
period
that
had
arisen
in
the
life
of
the
nation
the
second
inaugural
address
coming
so
shortly
before
the
death
formed
unintentionally
his
farewell
address
it
has
the
spirit
and
tone
of
prophecy
the
bible
in
thought
and
expression
was
its
inspiration
the
first
two
of
its
three
paragraphs
ring
like
a
chapter
from
isaiah
chief
of
the
poet
seers
of
old
the
concluding
paragraph
is
an
apostolic
benediction
such
as
paul
or
john
might
have
delivered
with
malice
toward
none
with
charity
for
all
with
firmness
in
the
right
as
god
gives
us
to
see
the
right
let
us
strive
on
to
finish
the
work
we
are
in
to
bind
up
the
nation
wounds
to
care
for
him
who
shall
have
borne
the
battle
and
for
his
widow
and
his
orphan
to
do
all
which
may
achieve

you
again

duty
devolves
upon
me
which
is
greater
perhaps
than
that
which
has
devolved

man

never

have
succeeded
except
for
the
aid

upon
which
he
at

relied
i
feel
that
i
can
not
succeed
without
the
same
divine
aid
which
sustained
him
and
on
the

almighty
being
i
place
my
reliance
for
support
and
i
hope
you
my

will
pray
that
i
may
receive
the

assistance
without

with

if
he
did

pray
also

fervently

hall
then
went
inside
and
spoke
as
follows
i
am
filled
with
deep
emotion
at
finding
myself
standing
in
this
place
where
were
collected
together
the
wisdom
the
patriotism
the
devotion
to
principle
from
which
sprang
the
institutions
under
which
we
live
you
have
kindly
suggested
to
me
that
in
my
hands
is
the
task
of
restoring
peace
to
our
distracted
country
i
can
say
in
return
sirs
that
all
the
political
sentiments
i
entertain
have
been
drawn
so
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
draw
them
from
the
sentiments
which
originated
in
and
were
given
to
the
world
from
this
hall
i
have
never
had
a
feeling
politically
that
did
not
spring
from
the
sentiments
embodied
in
the
declaration
of
independence
i
have
often
pondered
over
the
dangers
which
were
incurred
by
the
men
who
assembled
here
and
framed
and
adopted
that
declaration
i
have
pondered
over
the
toils
that
were
endured
by
the
officers
and
soldiers
of
the
army
who
achieved
that
independence
i
have
often
inquired
of
myself
what
great
principle
or
idea
it
was
that
kept
this
confederacy
so
long
together
it
was
not
the
mere
matter
of
separation
of
the
colonies
from
the
motherland
but
that
sentiment
in
the
declaration
of
independence
which
gave
liberty
not
alone
to
the
people
of
this
country
but
hope
to
all
the
world
for
all
future
time
it
was
that
which
gave
promise
that
in
due
time
the
weight
would
be
lifted
from
the
shoulders
of
all
men
and
that
all
should
have
an
equal
chance
this
is
the
sentiment
embodied
in
the
declaration
of
independence
now
my
friends
can
this
country
be
saved
on
that
basis
if
it
can
i
will
consider
myself
one
of
the
happiest
men
in
the
world
if
i
can
help
to
save
it
but
if
this
country
can
not
be
saved
without
giving
up
that
principle
i
was
about
to
say
i
would
rather
be
assassinated
on
this
spot
than
surrender
it
four
years
and
two
months
later

his
body

all
a

mixed

with

matched

the

was
in

earth

odor
of
the

things
the
rectitude
and
patience
of
the

the
gladness
of

low

as

that
shoulders
out

so
he
came
from

cabin
up

one
fair
ideal
led
our
chieftain
on
forevermore
he
burned
to
do
his
deed
with
the
fine
stroke
and
gesture
of
a
king
he
built
the

he

his
splendid
strength
through

blow
the
conscience

him
testing
every
stroke

make
his

shook

held
the

purpose
like

held
on
through

and
faltered
not
at

and
when
he
fell
in

he

wrote

i
had
seen
the

a

without
poetic
result
yet
you
come
on
a
visit
and
carry
away
the
inspiration
needed
lincoln
church
in
washington
within
the
historic
church
both
eye
and
soul
perceived
it
was
the
pew
where
lincoln
sat
the
only
lincoln
god
hath
given
to
men
olden
among
the
modern
seats
of
prayer
dark
like
the
place
and
past
akin
all
else
has
changed
but
this
remains
the
same
a
sanctuary
in
a
sanctuary
where
lincoln
prayed
what
passion
had
his
soul
mixt
faith
and
anguish
melting
into
prayer
upon
the
burning
altar
of
god
fane
a
nation
altar
even
as
his
own
where
lincoln
prayed
such
worshipers
as
he
make
thin
ranks
down
the
ages
wouldst
thou
know
his
spirit
suppliant
then
must
thou
feel
war
fiery
baptism
taste
hate
bitter
cup
spend
similar
sweat
of
blood
vicarious
and
sound
the
cry
if
it
be
possible
from
stricken
heart
in
new
gethsemane
who
saw
him
there
are
gone
as
he
is
gone
the
pew
remains
with
what
god
gave
him
there
and
all
the
world
through
him
so
let
it
be
one
of

as

at

address
delivered
at
the
dedication
of
the
cemetery
at
gettysburg
four
score
and
seven
years
ago
our
fathers
brought
forth
on
this
continent
a
new
nation
conceived
in
liberty
and
dedicated
to
the
proposition
that
all
men
are
created
equal
now
we
are
engaged
in
a
great
civil
war
testing
whether
that
nation
or
any
nation
so
conceived
and
so
dedicated
can
long
endure
we
are
met
on
a
great
battlefield
of
that
war
we
have
come
to
dedicate
a
portion
of
that
field
as
a
final
resting
place
for
those
who
here
gave
their
lives
that
that
nation
might
live
it
is
altogether
fitting
and
proper
that
we
should
do
this
but
in
a
larger
sense
we
can
not
dedicate
we
can
not
consecrate
we
can
not
hallow
this
ground
the
brave
men
living
and
dead
who
struggled
here
have
consecrated
it
far
above
our
poor
power
to
add
or
detract
the
world
will
little
note
nor
long
remember
what
we
say
here
but
it
can
never
forget
what
they
did
here
it
is
for
us
the
living
rather
to
be
dedicated
here
to
the
unfinished
work
which
they
who
fought
here
have
thus
far
so
nobly
advanced
it
is
rather
for
us
to
be
here
dedicated
to
the
great
task
remaining
before
us
that
from
these
honored
dead
we
take
increased
devotion
to
that
cause
for
which
they
gave
their
last
full
measure
of
devotion
that
we
here
highly
resolve
that
these
dead
shall
not
have
died
in
vain
that
this
nation
under
god
shall
have
a
new
birth
of
freedom
and
that

undoubtedly
there
were
many
in
the
audience
who
fully
appreciated
the
beauty
of
the
president
address
and
many
of
those
who
read
it
on
the
following
day
perceived
its
wondrous
character
but
it
is
apparent
that
its
full
force
and
grandeur
were
not
generally
recognized
then
either
by
its
auditors
or
its
readers
not
until
the
war
had
ended
and
the
great
leader
had
fallen
did
the
nation
realize
that
this

given
to
gettysburg

are
apart
he
walks
with
us
in
man
estate
we
know
his
was
a
brother
heart
the
marching
years
may
render
dim
the
humanness
of
other
men
today
we
are
akin
to
him
as
they
who
knew
him
best
were
then
wars
have
been
won
by
hands
realms
have
been
ruled
by
kings
but
he
above
these
others
stands
as
one
who
loved
the
common
things
the
common
faith
of
man
was
his
the
common
faith
of
man
he
had
for
this
today
his
grave
face
is
a
face
half
joyous
and
half
sad
a
man
of
earth
of
earthy
stuff
as
honest
as
the
fruitful
soil
gnarled
as
the
friendly
trees
and
rough
as
hillsides
that
had
known
his
toil
of
earthy
stuff
let
it
be
told
for
men
rise
and
reveal
a
courage
fair
as
beaten
gold
and
the
enduring
strength
of
steel
so
now
he
dominates
our
thought
this
humble
great
man
holds
us
thus
because
of
all
he
dreamed
and
wrought
because
he
is
akin
to
us
he
held
his
patient
trust
in
truth
while
god
was
working
out
his
plan
and
they
that
were
his
foes
forsooth
came
to
pay
tribute
to
the
man
not
as
the
great
who
grow
more
great
until
they
have
a
mystic
fame
no
stroke
of
fortune
nor
of
fate
gave
lincoln
his
undying
name
a
common
man
one
of
the
breed
who
work
and
wait
his
was
a
soul
above
all
scorn
his
was
a
heart
above

hate

lincoln
a

from
here

there
had
sown
the
name
at
which
we
sneered
but
soon
the
name
was
everywhere
to
be
reviled
and
then
revered
a
presence
to
be
loved
and
feared
we
can
not
hide
it
or
deny
that
we
the
gentlemen
who
jeered
may
be
forgotten
by
and
by
he
came
when
days
were
perilous
and
hearts
of
men
were
sore
beguiled
and
having
made
his
note
of
us
he
pondered
and
was
reconciled
was
ever
master
yet
so
mild
as
he
and
so
untamable
we
doubted
even
when
he
smiled
not
knowing
what
he
knew
so
well
he
knew
that
undeceiving
fate
would
shame
us
whom
he
served
unsought
he
knew
that
he
must
wince
and
wait
the
jest
of
those
for
whom
he
fought
he
knew
devoutly
what
he
thought
of
us
and
of
our
ridicule
he
knew
that
we
must
all
be
taught
like
little
children
in
a
school
we
gave
a
glamour
to
the
task
that
he
encountered
and
saw
through
but
little
of
us
did
he
ask
and
little
did
we
ever
do
and
what
appears
if
we
review
the
season
when
we
railed
and
chaffed
it
is
the
face
of
one
who
knew
that
we
were
learning
while
we
laughed
the
face
that
in
our
vision
feels
again
the
venom
that
we
flung
transfigured
to
the
world
reveals
the
vigilance
to
which
we
clung
shrewd
hallowed
harassed
and
among
the
mysteries
that
are
untold
the
face
we
see
was
never
young
nor
could
it
ever
have
been
old
for
he
to
whom
we
had
applied
our
shopman
test
of
age
and
worth
was
elemental
when
he
died
as
he
was
ancient
at
his
birth
the
saddest
among
kings
of
earth
bowed
with
a
galling
crown
this
man
met
rancor
with
a
cryptic
mirth
laconic
and
olympian
the
love
the
grandeur
and
the
fame
are
bounded
by
the
world
alone
the
calm
the
smouldering
and
the
flame
of
awful
patience
were
his
own
with
him
they
are
forever
flown
past
all
our
fond
wherewith
we
cumber
the
unknown
as
with
inept
icarian

for
we
were
not

the

he
thirsty
for

feverish
for

he
went
about
his
work
such
work
as
few
ever
had
laid
on
head
and
heart
and
hand
as
one
who
knows
where
there
a
task
to

honest

must
heaven
good
grace
command
who
trusts
the
strength
will
with

his
will
if
but
that
will
we
can
arrive
to
know
nor
tamper
with
the
weights
of
good
and
ill
so
he
went
forth
to
battle
on
the
side
that
he
felt
clear
was
liberty
and
right
as
in
his
peasant
boyhood
he
had
plied
his
warfare
with
rude
nature
thwarting
mights
the
uncleared
forest
the
unbroken
soil
the
that
turned
the
lumberer
axe
the
rapid
that
the
boatmen
toil
the
prairie
hiding
the
mazed
wanderer
tracks
the
ambushed
indian
and
the
prowling
bear
such
were
the
needs
that
helped
his
youth
to
train
rough
culture
but
such
trees
large
fruit
may
bear
if
but
their
stocks
be
of
right
girth
and
grain
so
he
grew
up
a
destined
work
to
do
and
lived
to
do
it
four
years
lived
through
and
then
he
heard
the
hisses
change
to
cheers
the
taunts
to
tribute
the
abuse
to
praise
and
took
both
with
the
same
unwavering
mood
till
as
he
came
on
light
from
darking
days
and
seemed
to
touch
the
goal

where
he
stood

between

from

limbs
were

of

book
of
extracts
from

speeches
and
writings
he
wrote
the
following
poem
lincoln
and
stanton
especially
for
the
poets
lincoln
the
first
reference
in
it
is
to
the
case
over
the
patent
rights
of
the
reaping
machine
in
which
lincoln
had
been
at
first
selected
as
principal
pleader
but
was
superseded
by
edwin
stanton
having
thoroughly
prepared
himself
he
offered
his
assistance
to
stanton
but
was
brusquely
repulsed
he
was
so
hurt
that
he
felt
like
leaving
the
court
room
but
decided
in
loyalty
to
his
client
to
remain
and
leaving
his
place
among
counsel
took
a
seat
in
the
audience
despite
his
injured
feelings
he
was
filled
with
admiration
for
stanton
able
and
successful
conduct
of
the
case
lincoln
probably
referring
to
a
slur
of
stanton
reported
to
him
said
that
he
would
have
to
go
back
to
illinois
and
study
more
law
since
the
lawyers
were
pushing
hard
the
cornfield
ones
the
second
reference
is
to
stanton
criticism
of
conservative
course
during
the
first
months
of
his
presidency
that
imbecile
at
the
white
house
he
called
him
stanton
as
at
the
close
of
buchanan
administration
had
done
effective
work
in
foiling
the
plans
of
the
confederacy
and
he
believed
in
forceful
measures
to
put
down
the
rebellion
in
its
incipiency
the
third
reference
is
to
the
virtually
enforced
resignation
of
simon
cameron
lincoln
first
secretary
of
war
and
lincoln
choice
to
succeed
him
of
stanton
whom
he
realized
to
be
the
best
equipped
man
in
the
country
for
the
place
the
fourth
reference
is
to
stanton
remark
by
the
bedside
of
lincoln
as
the
stricken
president
ceased
breathing
there
lies
the
greatest

there
a

from
the
bird
on

wing
there
a
pall
on
the
sunshine
and
over
the
flowers
and
a
shadow
of
graves
on
these
spirits
of
ours
for
a
star
hath
gone
out
from
the
night
of
our
sky
on
whose
brightness
we
gazed
as
the
roll
by
so
tranquil
and
steady
and
clear
were
its
beams
that
they
fell
like
a
vision
of
peace
on
our
dreams
a
heart
that
we
knew
had
been
true
to
our
weal
and
a
hand
that
was
steadily
guiding
the
wheel
a
name
never
tarnished
by
falsehood
or
wrong
that
had
dwelt
in
our
hearts
like
a
song
ah
that
pure
noble
spirit
has
gone
to
its
rest
and
the
true
hand
lies
nerveless
and
cold
on
his
breast

the
name

the
memory
never

die

grow
brighter

dearer
as
ages
go
by

the
tears
of
a
nation
fall
over
the
dead
such
tears
as
a
nation
before
never
shed
for
our
cherished
one
fell
by
a
dastardly
hand
a
martyr
to
truth
and
the
cause
of
the
land
and
a
sorrow
has
surged
like
the
waves
to
the
shore
when
the
breath
of
the
tempest
is
sweeping
them
and
the
heads
of
the
lofty
and
lowly
have
bowed
as
the
shaft
of
the
lightning
sped
out
from
the
cloud
not
gathered
like
washington
home
to
his
rest

the
sun
of

far
down

stricken
from

in
the
midst
of
his
years
with
the
canaan
in

of
his
prayers
and
his
tears

the
people
whose
hearts
in

wilderness
failed
sometimes
when
the
star
of
their
promise
had
paled
now

advantages
for

were
somewhat
better
than
those
of
her
sister
alice
whose
almost
inseparable
companion
she
became
at
an
early
age
they
were
quite
different
however
in
temperament
in
person
and
in
mental
constitution
phoebe
began
to
write
verse
at
the
age
of
seventeen
years
and
one
of
her
earliest
poems
beginning
with
one
sweetly
solemn
thought
won
her
a
reputation
in
the
joint
housekeeping
in
new
york
she
took
from
choice
alice
being
for
many
years
an
invalid
the
larger
share
of
duties
upon
herself
and
hence
found
little
opportunity
for
literary
work
in
society
however
she
was
brilliant
but
at
all
times
kindly
she
wrote
a
touching
tribute
to
her
sister
memory
published
in
the
a
few
days
before
her
own
death

occurred
at

for

unheeding

waited
to
honor

when
the
cry
of
a
child
smote
upon
him
and
turned
back
his
feet
three
days
hath
a
woman
been
waiting
said
they
patient
and
meek
and
he
answered
whatever
her
errand
let
me
hear
let
her
speak
so
she
came
and
stood
trembling
before
him
and
pleaded
her
cause
told
him
all
how
her
child
erring
father
had
broken
the
laws
humbly
spake
she
i
mourn
for
his
folly
his
weakness
his
fall
proudly
spake
she
he
is
not

the

had
been
shaken
by
a
little

answered
soft
taking
counsel

this
man
shall
not
die
why
he
heard
from

cry
which
oppression
smothered
down
on

lips
in
her
furnace
the
centuries
had
welded
their
fetter
and
chain
and
like
withes
in
the
hands
of
his
purpose
he
snapped
them
in
twain
who
can
be
what
he
was
to
the

what
he
was
to

shall
the

for
him
