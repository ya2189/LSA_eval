a
drowsy
fool
wrapped
in
fleecy
clouds
and
white
and
all
the
while
endymion
sleeps
on
latmos
top
alone
not
a
single
star
is
seen
they
are
gathered
round
their
queen
keeping
vigil
by
her
bed
patient
and
unwearièd
now
the
poet
drops
his
pen
and
moves
about
like
other
men
tom
o
bedlam
now
is
still
and
sleeps
beneath
the
hawthorn
hill
only
the
latmian
shepherd
deems
something
missing
from
his
dreams
and
tosses
as
he
sleeps
alone
alas
alas
endymion
as
a
hot
traveller
going
through
stones
and
sands
who
sees
clear
water
stir
amid
the
weary
lands
takes
in
his
hollowed
hands
the
clean
and
lively
water
that
trickles
down
his
throat
like
laughter
like
laughter
so
when
you
come
to
me
across
these
parchèd
places
and
all
the
waste
i
see
flowered
with
your
graces
i
take
between
my
hands
your
face
like
a
rare
cup
where
kisses
mix
with
laughter
and
drink
and
drink
them
up
like
water
like
water
rhymeless
rhyme
with
its
jingle
still
betrays
the
song
that
meant
for
one
alone
dearest
i
dedicate
to
you
a
little
song
without
a
rhyme
the
most
unpractised
schoolboy
knows
that
quiet
kisses
are
the
sweetest
safe
locked
within
my
arms
you
lie
let
not
a
single
sound
betray
us
suppose
your
jealous
mother
came
by
chance
this
way
and
found
us
here
be
still
be
still
and
not
a
sound
shall
give
her
warning
that
we
love
and
my
heart
is
like
a
meadow
where
clouds
go
over
dappling
the
mingled
grass
and
clover
with
mingled
sun
and
shadow
with
light
that
will
not
stay
and
shade
that
sails
away
your
heart
is
like
an
orchard
that
has
the
sun
for
ever
in
its
leaves
where
on
the
grass
beneath
the
trees
there
falls
the
shadow
of
the
fruit
that
ripen
there
for
me
thinks
that
he
who
thinks
that
he
possesses
his
mistress
with
his
kisses
knows
neither
love
nor
her
nor
beauty
is
not
his
who
seeks
it
in
a
kiss
if
you
would
seek
for
this
o
seek
it
otherwhere
love
is
a
flame
a
spirit
beyond
all
earthly
merit
and
all
we
dream
of
here
strive
as
you
may
but
still
love
is
intangible
no
servant
to
your
will
but
sovereign
otherwhere
in
the
open
i
love
you
in
the
open
air
but
stuffy
rooms
and
blazing
fires
and
mirrors
with
familiar
stare
cloak
and
befoul
my
high
desires
the
dearest
day
that
i
have
known
was
in
the
fields
when
driving
rain
was
like
a
veil
around
us
thrown
a
grey
close
veil
without
a
stain
the
young
was
stripped
and
bare
but
naked
twigs
a
shelter
made
where
curious
cows
came
round
to
stare
and
stood
astonished
and
dismayed
let
it
be
rain
or
summer
sun
smell
of
wet
earth
or
scent
of
flowers
love
once
more
give
me
give
me
one
of
these
enchanted
lover
hours
in
the
i
am
afraid
we
are
too
glad
too
gay
our
life
too
sweet
too
bright
to
last
another
day
what
hap
what
chance
can
fall
what
sorrow
come
what
schism
what
loss
what
cataclysm
to
part
us
two
at
all
the
stars
with
ageless
fire
in
skies
serene
the
same
observe
our
young
desire
and
watch
our
loves
aflame
a
whisper
soft
a
sound
unfollowed
unattended
shakes
all
the
branches
round
they
sleep
and
it
is
ended
you
sleep
and
i
alone
torment
myself
with
fear
for
new
joys
coming
near
and
gracious
actions
done
i
am
afraid
we
are
too
glad
too
gay
our
life
too
sweet
too
bright
to
last
another
day
old
the
wild
duck
fly
over
from
river
to
river
and
so
the
young
lover
goes
roving
for
ever
they
fly
together
he
walks
alone
no
maiden
can
tether
him
with
her
moan
at
the
bursting
of
blossom
on
her
breast
his
head
he
has
left
her
bosom
ere
the
apples
are
red
across
the
valley
singing
he
goes
in
highway
and
alley
he
seeks
a
new
rose
tell
me
o
maidens
you
who
all
day
in
lyrical
cadence
dance
and
play
why
do
you
proffer
your
sweets
to
one
who
takes
all
you
offer
and
leaves
you
to
moan
now
spring
comes
round
again
with
blossom
on
the
tree
dark
blossom
of
the
peach
light
blossom
of
the
pear
and
amorous
birds
complain
and
nesting
birds
prepare
and
love
keen
fingers
reach
after
the
heart
of
me
but
now
the
blackthorn
blows
about
the
dusty
lane
and
new
buds
peep
and
peer
i
have
no
joy
at
all
for
love
draws
near
its
close
and
love
white
blossoms
fall
and
in
the
springing
year
love
fingers
bring
me
pain
my
mother
told
me
this
for
true
that
there
behind
the
mountains
that
wear
the
mists
about
their
feet
and
clouds
about
their
summits
there
grows
the
weed
forgetfulness
it
grows
there
in
the
gullies
if
i
but
knew
the
way
thereto
three
days
long
would
i
wander
and
pick
a
handful
of
the
weed
and
drink
it
steeped
in
honey
that
so
i
might
forget
your
mouth
a
thousand
times
that
kissed
me
hawthorn
above
as
pale
as
frost
against
the
paling
sky
is
lost
on
the
pool
dark
sheet
below
the
candid
glow
as
i
came
up
and
saw
from
far
the
water
littered
star
on
star
i
thought
the
may
had
left
its
hedge
to
float
upon
the
pool
dark
edge
the
world
great
ways
unclose
through
little
wooded
hills
an
air
that
stirs
and
stills
dies
sighing
where
it
rose
or
flies
to
sigh
again
in
elms
whose
stately
rows
receive
the
summer
rain
and
clouds
clouds
clouds
go
by
a
drifting
cavalry
in
squadrons
that
disperse
and
troops
that
reassemble
and
now
they
pass
and
now
their
glittering
wealth
disburse
on
tufted
grass
and
lately
leafing
bough
thus
through
the
shining
day
we
love
or
pass
away
light
hours
in
golden
sleep
with
clos
eyes
and
lids
the
light
comes
through
as
sheep
and
flowers
do
who
no
new
toils
devise
while
shining
insects
creep
about
us
where
we
lie
beneath
a
pleasant
sky
in
fields
no
trouble
fills
whence
as
the
traveller
goes
the
world
great
ways
unclose
through
little
wooded
hills
at
the
moon
poured
down
on
tree
and
field
the
leaf
was
silvered
on
the
hedge
the
sleeping
kine
were
half
revealed
half
shadowed
at
the
pasture
edge
by
steep
inclines
and
long
descents
amid
the
inattentive
trees
you
spoke
of
the
four
elements
the
four
eternal
mysteries
august
is
gone
and
now
this
is
september
softer
the
sun
in
a
cloudier
sky
yellow
the
leaves
grow
and
apples
grow
golden
blackberries
ripen
and
hedges
undress
watch
and
you
see
the
departure
of
summer
here
is
the
end
this
the
last
month
of
all
pause
and
look
back
and
remember
its
promise
all
that
looked
open
and
easy
in
may
nothing
will
stay
them
the
seasons
go
onward
lightly
the
bright
months
fly
out
of
my
hand
softly
the
leading
note
calls
a
new
octave
autumn
is
coming
and
what
have
i
done
even
as
summer
my
young
days
go
over
no
day
to
pause
on
and
nowhere
to
rest
slowly
they
go
but
implacably
onwards
ah
and
my
dreams
alas
still
they
are
dreams
how
shall
i
force
all
my
flowers
to
fruition
use
up
the
season
of
ripening
sun
softly
the
years
go
but
going
have
vanished
soon
i
shall
find
myself
empty
and
old
yet
i
feel
in
myself
bright
buds
and
blossoms
promise
of
mellowest
bearing
to
be
still
i
have
time
beside
what
i
have
wasted
life
shall
be
good
to
me
work
shall
be
sweet
new
song
about
the
from
amberley
to
storrington
from
storrington
to
amberley
from
amberley
to
washington
you
can
not
see
or
smell
the
sea
but
why
the
devil
should
you
wish
to
see
the
home
of
silly
fish
since
i
prefer
the
earth
and
air
the
fish
may
wallow
in
the
sea
and
live
the
life
that
they
prefer
if
they
will
leave
the
land
to
me
so
wish
for
each
what
he
may
wish
the
earth
for
me
the
sea
for
fish
the
winter
soldier
winter
i
to
be
sung
to
the
tune
of
high
germany
no
more
the
english
girls
may
go
to
follow
with
the
drum
but
still
they
flock
together
to
see
the
soldiers
come
for
horse
and
foot
are
marching
by
and
the
bold
artillery
they
going
to
the
cruel
wars
in
low
germany
they
marching
down
by
lane
and
town
and
they
are
hot
and
dry
but
as
they
marched
together
i
heard
the
soldiers
cry
o
all
of
us
both
horse
and
foot
and
the
proud
artillery
we
going
to
the
merry
wars
in
low
germany
ii
the
comrades
the
men
that
marched
and
sang
with
me
are
most
of
them
in
flanders
now
i
lie
abed
and
hear
the
wind
blow
softly
through
the
budding
bough
and
they
are
scattered
far
and
wide
in
this
or
that
brave
regiment
from
trench
to
trench
across
the
mud
they
go
the
way
that
others
went
they
run
with
shining
bayonet
or
lie
and
take
a
careful
aim
and
theirs
it
is
to
learn
of
death
and
theirs
the
joy
and
theirs
the
fame
iii
in
training
the
wind
is
cold
and
heavy
and
storms
are
in
the
sky
our
path
across
the
heather
goes
higher
and
more
high
to
right
the
town
we
came
from
to
left
blue
hills
and
sea
the
wind
is
growing
colder
and
shivering
are
we
we
drag
with
stiffening
fingers
our
rifles
up
the
hill
the
path
is
steep
and
tangled
but
leads
to
flanders
still
iv
the
old
soldiers
we
come
from
dock
and
shipyard
we
come
from
car
and
train
we
come
from
foreign
countries
to
slope
our
arms
again
and
forming
fours
by
numbers
or
turning
to
the
right
we
learning
all
our
drill
again
and
is
a
pretty
sight
our
names
are
all
unspoken
our
regiments
forgotten
for
some
of
us
were
pretty
bad
and
some
of
us
were
rotten
and
some
will
misremember
what
once
they
learnt
with
pain
and
hit
a
bloody
serjeant
and
go
to
clink
again
going
in
to
dinner
beat
the
knife
on
the
plate
and
the
fork
on
the
can
for
we
going
in
to
dinner
so
make
all
the
noise
you
can
up
and
down
the
officer
wanders
looking
blue
sing
a
song
to
cheer
him
up
he
wants
his
dinner
too
march
into
the
make
the
tables
rattle
like
a
dozen
dam
machine
guns
in
the
bloody
battle
use
your
forks
for
use
your
plates
for
drums
make
a
most
infernal
clatter
here
the
dinner
comes
vi
on
trek
under
a
grey
dawn
timidly
breaking
through
the
little
village
the
men
are
waking
easing
their
stiff
limbs
and
rubbing
their
eyes
from
my
misted
window
i
watch
the
sun
rise
in
the
middle
of
the
village
a
fountain
stands
round
it
the
men
sit
washing
their
red
hands
slowly
the
light
grows
we
call
the
roll
over
bring
the
laggards
stumbling
from
their
warm
cover
slowly
the
company
gathers
all
together
and
the
men
and
the
officer
look
shyly
at
the
weather
by
the
left
quick
march
off
the
column
goes
all
through
the
village
all
the
windows
unclose
at
every
window
stands
a
child
early
waking
to
see
what
road
the
company
is
taking
vii
leaving
the
billet
good
luck
good
health
good
temper
these
a
very
hive
of
to
make
and
store
up
happiness
should
wait
upon
you
without
cease
if
i
the
power
to
call
them
down
into
this
stuffy
little
town
where
the
dull
air
in
sticky
wreaths
afflicts
a
man
each
time
he
breathes
but
since
i
have
no
power
to
call
benevolent
spirits
down
at
all
i
wish
you
all
the
good
i
know
and
close
the
chapter
up
and
go
viii
the
farewell
farewell
to
rising
early
now
comes
the
lying
late
and
long
on
the
my
company
shall
wait
before
i
come
to
join
it
on
mornings
cold
and
dark
and
no
more
shall
i
lead
it
across
the
rimy
park
the
men
shall
still
manoeuvre
in
sunshine
and
in
rain
and
still
they
make
the
blunders
i
shall
not
check
again
they
march
upon
the
highway
in
weather
foul
and
fair
and
talk
and
sing
with
laughter
and
i
shall
not
be
there
ix
on
account
of
ill
health
you
go
brave
friends
and
i
am
cast
to
stay
behind
to
read
with
frowning
eyes
and
discontented
mind
the
shining
history
that
you
are
gone
to
make
to
sleep
with
working
brain
to
dream
and
to
awake
into
another
day
of
most
ignoble
peace
to
drowse
to
read
to
smoke
to
pray
that
war
may
cease
the
spring
is
coming
on
and
with
the
spring
you
go
in
countries
where
strange
scents
on
the
april
breezes
blow
you
see
the
primroses
marched
down
into
the
mud
you
see
the
wear
crimson
flowers
of
blood
and
i
shall
walk
about
as
i
did
walk
of
old
where
the
laburnum
trails
its
chains
of
useless
gold
i
break
a
branch
of
may
i
pick
a
violet
and
see
the
flowers
that
soldiers
must
forget
i
love
i
laugh
i
dream
and
write
undying
songs
but
with
your
regiment
my
marching
soul
belongs
men
that
have
marched
with
me
and
men
that
i
have
led
shall
know
and
feel
the
things
that
i
have
only
read
shall
know
what
thing
it
is
to
sleep
beneath
the
skies
and
to
expect
their
death
what
time
the
sun
shall
rise
men
that
have
marched
with
me
shall
march
to
peace
again
bringing
for
plunder
home
glad
memories
of
pain
of
toils
endured
and
done
of
terrors
quite
brought
under
and
all
the
world
shall
be
their
plaything
and
their
wonder
then
in
that
world
unfriendly
and
estranged
i
shall
be
quite
alone
i
shall
be
left
unchanged
out
of
that
noise
and
hurry
of
large
life
the
river
flings
me
in
an
idle
pool
the
waters
still
go
on
with
stir
and
strife
and
sunlit
eddies
and
the
beautiful
tall
trees
lean
down
upon
the
mighty
flow
reflected
in
that
movement
beauty
there
waxes
more
beautiful
the
moments
grow
thicker
and
keener
in
that
lovely
air
above
the
river
here
small
sticks
and
straws
come
now
to
harbour
gather
lie
and
rot
out
of
and
the
water
flaws
in
this
unmoving
death
where
joy
is
not
where
war
a
shade
again
ambition
rotten
and
bitter
hopes
and
fears
alike
forgotten
dead
when
i
grow
old
they
come
to
me
and
say
did
you
then
know
him
in
that
distant
day
did
you
speak
with
him
touch
his
hand
observe
the
proud
eyes
fire
soft
voice
and
light
lips
curve
and
i
shall
answer
this
man
was
my
friend
call
to
my
memory
add
improve
amend
and
count
up
all
the
meetings
that
we
had
and
note
his
good
and
touch
upon
his
bad
when
i
grow
older
and
more
garrulous
i
shall
discourse
on
the
dead
poet
thus
i
said
to
him
he
answered
unto
me
he
dined
with
me
one
night
in
trinity
i
supped
with
him
in
king
ah
pitiful
the
twisted
memories
of
an
ancient
fool
and
sweet
the
silence
of
a
young
man
dead
now
far
in
lemnos
sleeps
that
golden
head
unchanged
serene
for
ever
young
and
strong
lifted
above
the
chances
that
belong
to
us
who
live
for
he
shall
not
grow
old
and
only
of
his
youth
there
shall
be
told
magical
stories
true
and
wondrous
tales
as
of
a
god
whose
virtue
never
fails
whose
limbs
shall
never
waste
eyes
never
fall
and
whose
clear
brain
shall
not
be
dimmed
at
all
pastoral
pieces
vision
in
the
the
husht
september
afternoon
was
sweet
with
rich
and
peaceful
light
i
could
not
hear
on
either
side
the
sound
of
moving
feet
although
the
hidden
road
was
very
near
the
laden
wood
had
powdered
sun
in
it
slipped
through
the
leaves
a
quiet
messenger
to
tell
me
of
the
golden
world
outside
where
fields
of
stubble
stretched
through
counties
wide
and
yet
i
did
not
move
my
head
reposed
upon
a
tuft
of
dry
and
scented
grass
and
with
eyes
through
eyelids
closed
i
watched
the
languid
chain
of
shadows
pass
light
as
the
slowly
moving
shade
imposed
by
summer
clouds
upon
a
sea
of
glass
and
strove
to
banish
or
to
make
more
clear
the
elusive
and
persistent
dream
of
her
and
then
i
saw
her
very
dim
at
first
peering
for
nuts
amid
the
twisted
boughs
thought
her
some
dryad
lately
burst
out
of
the
chambers
of
her
leafy
house
seeking
for
nuts
for
food
and
for
her
thirst
such
water
as
the
woodland
stream
allows
after
the
greedy
summer
has
drunk
up
all
but
a
drain
within
the
mossy
cup
then
i
beholding
her
was
still
a
space
and
marked
each
posture
as
she
moved
or
stood
watching
the
sunlight
on
her
hair
and
face
thus
with
calm
folded
hands
and
quiet
blood
i
gazed
until
her
counterfeited
grace
faded
and
left
me
lonely
in
the
wood
glad
that
the
gods
had
given
so
much
as
this
to
see
her
if
i
might
not
have
her
kiss
this
is
the
valley
where
we
sojourn
now
cut
up
by
narrow
brooks
and
rich
and
green
and
shaded
sweetly
by
the
waving
bough
about
the
trench
where
floats
the
soft
serene
arun
with
waters
running
low
and
low
through
banks
where
lately
still
the
tide
has
been
here
is
our
you
walk
with
me
and
watch
the
light
die
out
in
amberley
the
light
that
dies
is
soft
and
flooding
still
shed
from
the
broad
expanse
of
all
the
skies
and
brimming
up
the
space
from
hill
to
hill
where
yet
the
sheep
in
their
sweet
exercise
roaming
the
meadows
crop
and
find
their
fill
and
to
each
other
speak
with
moaning
cries
we
on
the
standing
rest
and
see
the
light
die
out
in
brook
and
grass
and
tree
lately
we
walked
upon
the
lonely
downs
and
through
the
still
heat
of
the
heavy
day
we
heard
the
medley
of
low
drifting
sounds
and
through
the
matted
brambles
found
a
way
or
lightly
trod
upon
enchanted
grounds
musing
or
with
rich
blackberries
made
delay
where
feed
such
fruit
on
the
rich
air
until
we
struck
like
falling
stars
from
bignor
hill
down
the
vast
slope
by
chalky
roads
and
steep
with
trees
and
bushes
hidden
here
and
there
by
circling
turns
into
the
valley
deep
we
came
and
left
behind
the
air
for
this
cool
village
where
we
sleep
a
country
meal
a
country
bed
to
share
with
sleepy
kisses
and
contented
dreams
over
a
land
of
still
and
narrow
streams
the
light
is
ebbing
in
the
dusky
sky
the
valley
floor
is
in
the
shadow
hark
with
rushing
and
mysterious
noises
fly
the
bats
already
looking
for
the
dark
with
blinking
still
and
unaccustomed
eye
now
over
rackham
mount
a
steady
spark
burns
rising
slowly
in
the
rising
night
and
pledges
peace
and
promises
delight
now
from
the
east
the
wheeling
shade
appears
and
softly
night
into
the
valley
falls
soft
on
the
meadows
drop
her
dewy
tears
softly
a
darkness
on
the
crumbled
walls
now
in
the
dusk
the
village
disappears
men
songs
are
hushed
there
and
the
children
calls
while
night
in
passage
swallows
up
the
land
and
in
the
shadow
your
hand
seeks
my
hand
only
the
glimmering
stars
in
heaven
lie
and
unseen
trees
with
rustling
still
betray
how
all
the
valley
lives
invisibly
where
dim
sweet
odours
remnants
of
the
day
float
from
the
sleeping
fields
to
please
and
die
borne
up
by
roaming
airs
that
drift
away
beyond
our
hearing
vagabond
and
light
to
visit
the
cool
meadows
of
the
night
pursuit
of
daphne
is
running
running
through
the
grass
the
long
stalks
whip
her
ankles
as
she
goes
i
saw
the
nymph
the
god
i
saw
them
pass
and
how
a
mounting
flush
of
tender
rose
invaded
the
white
bosom
of
the
lass
and
reached
her
shoulders
conquering
their
snows
he
wasted
all
his
breath
imploring
still
they
passed
behind
the
shadow
of
the
hill
the
mad
course
goes
across
the
silent
plain
their
flying
footsteps
make
a
path
of
sound
through
all
the
sleeping
country
now
with
pain
she
runs
across
a
stretch
of
stony
ground
that
wounds
her
feet
and
now
again
she
hastens
through
a
wood
where
flowers
abound
which
staunch
her
cuts
with
balsam
where
she
treads
and
for
her
healing
give
their
trodden
heads
her
sisters
from
their
coverts
unbetrayed
look
out
in
fright
and
see
the
two
go
by
each
unrelenting
and
reflect
dismayed
how
fear
and
anguish
glisten
in
her
eye
by
them
unhelped
goes
on
the
fleeting
maid
whose
breath
is
coming
short
in
agony
hard
at
her
heels
pursues
the
golden
boy
she
flies
in
fear
of
him
she
flies
from
joy
his
arrows
scattered
on
the
countryside
his
shining
bow
deserted
he
pursues
through
hindering
woodlands
over
meadows
wide
and
now
no
longer
as
he
runs
he
sues
but
breathing
deep
and
set
and
his
flashing
feet
disperse
the
morning
dews
his
hands
most
roughly
put
the
boughs
away
that
cross
and
cling
and
join
and
make
delay
across
small
shining
brooks
and
rills
they
leap
and
now
she
fords
the
waters
of
a
stream
her
hot
knees
plunge
into
the
hollows
deep
and
cool
where
ancient
trout
in
quiet
dream
the
silver
minnows
wakened
from
their
sleep
in
sunny
shallows
round
her
ankles
gleam
she
scrambles
up
the
grassy
bank
and
on
though
courage
and
quick
breath
are
nearly
done
now
in
the
dusky
spinneys
round
the
field
the
fauns
set
up
a
joyous
mimicry
pursuing
of
light
nymphs
who
lightly
yield
or
startle
the
young
dryad
from
her
tree
and
shout
with
joy
to
see
her
limbs
revealed
and
give
her
grace
and
bid
her
swiftly
flee
the
hunt
is
up
pursuer
and
pursued
run
double
twist
evade
turn
grasp
elude
the
woodlands
are
alive
with
chase
and
cry
escape
and
triumph
still
the
nymph
in
vain
with
heaving
breast
in
lovely
agony
and
wide
and
shining
eyes
that
show
her
pain
leads
on
the
god
and
now
she
knows
him
nigh
and
sees
before
her
the
unsheltered
plain
his
hot
hand
touches
her
white
side
and
she
thrusts
up
her
hands
and
turns
into
a
tree
there
is
an
end
of
dance
and
mocking
tune
of
laughter
and
bright
love
among
the
leaves
the
sky
is
overcast
the
afternoon
is
dull
and
heavy
for
a
god
who
grieves
the
woods
are
quiet
and
the
soon
the
ruffled
dryad
in
her
trunk
receives
cold
grow
the
sunburnt
bodies
and
the
white
the
nymphs
and
fauns
will
lie
alone
miscellaneous
poems
on
infinite
peace
is
hanging
in
the
air
infinite
peace
is
resting
on
mine
eyes
that
just
an
hour
ago
learnt
how
to
bear
seeing
your
body
flaming
harmonies
the
grey
clouds
flecked
with
orange
are
and
gold
birds
unto
rest
are
falling
falling
falling
and
all
the
earth
goes
slowly
into
night
steadily
turning
from
the
harshly
bright
sunset
and
now
the
wind
is
growing
cold
and
in
my
heart
a
hidden
voice
is
calling
say
is
our
sense
of
beauty
mixed
with
earth
when
lip
on
lip
and
breast
on
breast
we
cling
when
ecstasy
brings
short
bright
sobs
to
birth
and
all
our
pulses
both
our
bodies
sing
when
through
the
haze
that
gathers
on
my
sight
i
see
your
eyelids
know
the
eyes
behind
see
me
and
half
not
see
me
when
our
blood
goes
roaring
like
a
deep
tremendous
flood
calm
and
terrific
in
unhasty
might
is
then
our
inner
sight
sealed
up
and
blind
or
could
it
be
that
when
our
blood
was
colder
and
side
by
side
we
sat
with
lips
disparted
i
saw
the
perfect
line
of
your
resting
shoulder
your
mouth
your
peaceful
throat
with
more
splendid
joy
ah
poignant
joys
all
these
and
rest
can
stab
the
heart
as
well
as
passion
yea
i
have
known
sobs
choke
my
heart
to
see
your
hair
move
languorously
ruffled
not
by
my
hands
but
by
the
breeze
and
i
have
prayed
the
rough
air
for
compassion
yea
i
have
knelt
to
the
unpiteous
air
and
knelt
to
gods
i
knew
not
to
remove
the
viewless
hands
whose
sight
i
could
not
bear
out
of
the
head
of
her
i
love
ecstasy
enters
me
and
can
not
speak
seizes
my
hands
and
smites
my
fainting
eyes
and
sends
through
all
my
veins
a
dim
despair
of
never
apprehending
all
so
fair
and
i
have
stood
unnerved
and
numb
and
weak
watching
your
breathing
bosom
fall
and
rise
ah
no
this
joy
is
empty
incomplete
and
sullied
with
a
sense
of
too
much
longing
where
thoughts
and
fancies
sweet
and
and
old
regrets
and
hopes
come
thronging
man
can
see
beauty
for
a
moment
space
and
live
having
seen
her
with
an
unfilmed
eye
if
all
his
body
and
all
his
soul
in
one
instant
are
tuned
by
passion
to
unison
and
i
can
image
in
your
kissing
face
the
eternal
meaning
of
the
earth
and
sky
in
time
of
because
the
days
are
long
for
you
and
me
i
make
this
song
to
lighten
their
slow
time
so
that
the
weary
waiting
fruitful
be
or
blossomed
only
by
my
limping
rhyme
the
days
are
very
long
and
may
not
shortened
be
by
any
chime
of
measured
words
or
any
fleeting
song
yet
let
us
gather
blossoms
while
we
wait
and
sing
brave
tunes
against
the
face
of
fate
day
after
day
goes
by
the
exquisite
procession
of
the
variable
year
summer
a
sheaf
with
flowers
bound
up
in
it
and
autumn
tender
till
the
frosts
appear
and
dry
the
humid
skies
and
winter
following
on
aloof
austere
clad
in
the
garments
of
a
frore
sunrise
and
spring
again
may
not
too
many
a
spring
make
both
our
voices
tremble
as
we
sing
the
days
are
empty
empty
and
the
nights
are
cold
and
void
there
is
no
single
gleam
across
the
space
unpeopled
of
delights
save
only
now
and
then
some
dream
some
stray
of
summer
weather
the
tedious
hours
like
laggarts
seem
when
you
and
i
my
love
are
not
together
and
when
i
hold
you
in
my
arms
at
last
the
minutes
go
like
april
cloudlets
past
and
yet
no
hidden
charm
no
desperate
spell
can
make
these
minutes
longer
those
less
long
no
force
there
is
that
yearning
can
impel
against
the
callous
years
which
do
us
wrong
no
words
no
whispered
rune
no
witchery
and
no
thessalian
song
can
make
that
misty
day
more
soon
the
bravest
tune
the
most
courageous
rhyme
fall
broken
from
the
bastions
of
time
a
long
and
dusty
road
it
is
to
tread
few
are
the
wayside
flowers
and
far
apart
and
are
no
sooner
plucked
than
withered
when
yearning
heart
is
torn
from
yearning
heart
a
weary
road
it
is
and
yet
far
off
i
see
clear
waters
start
and
clean
sweet
grass
and
tangled
traceries
of
whispering
leaves
that
laugh
to
see
us
come
and
there
one
day
one
day
shall
be
our
home
the
day
will
come
o
dearest
do
not
doubt
it
is
not
born
as
yet
but
i
shall
see
some
day
the
fearless
sunrise
flashing
out
and
know
the
night
will
give
you
up
to
me
o
heart
my
heart
be
glad
because
the
time
will
come
at
last
when
we
shall
leave
all
grief
and
unlearn
all
things
sad
and
know
the
joy
than
which
none
sweeter
is
and
i
shall
sing
a
happier
song
than
this
on
i
the
time
shall
be
old
wisdom
says
when
you
shall
grow
awrinkled
and
i
indifferent
shall
no
more
follow
the
light
steps
i
knew
or
trace
you
finding
out
the
way
you
went
by
swinging
branches
and
the
displaced
flowers
among
the
thickets
i
no
more
shall
stand
with
careful
pencil
through
the
adoring
hours
scratching
your
grace
on
paper
my
still
hand
no
more
shall
tremble
at
the
touch
of
yours
and
i
write
no
more
songs
and
you
not
sing
but
this
is
all
a
lie
for
love
endures
and
we
shall
closer
kiss
remembering
how
budding
trees
turned
barren
in
the
sun
through
this
long
week
whereof
one
day
now
done
ii
the
time
is
all
so
short
one
week
is
much
to
be
without
your
deep
and
peaceful
eyes
your
soft
and
cheek
the
touch
of
hands
o
were
we
wise
we
would
not
love
too
strongly
would
not
bind
life
into
life
so
inextricably
that
the
dumb
body
suffers
with
the
mind
in
a
sad
partnership
this
agony
for
death
will
come
and
swallow
up
us
two
you
there
i
here
and
we
shall
lie
apart
out
of
the
houses
and
the
woods
we
knew
then
in
the
lonely
grave
my
heart
out
of
the
dust
will
raise
if
it
can
speak
a
threnody
for
this
lost
lovely
week
iii
is
there
no
prophylactic
against
love
can
i
with
drugs
not
dull
the
ache
one
night
the
rain
is
heavy
and
the
low
clouds
move
over
the
empty
home
of
our
delight
and
find
me
in
it
weeping
you
are
far
and
you
are
now
asleep
the
night
so
thick
not
even
one
stooping
and
compassionate
star
shines
on
us
both
disparted
o
be
quick
torturing
days
and
heavy
turn
your
hours
to
minutes
melt
yourselves
into
one
day
the
cold
rain
falls
in
swift
assailing
showers
darkness
is
round
me
and
light
far
away
i
in
our
room
and
you
shut
in
by
strange
unfriendly
walls
i
never
seen
iv
lovers
that
drug
themselves
for
ecstasy
seek
love
too
closely
in
an
overdose
when
the
sweet
spasm
turns
to
agony
and
the
quick
limbs
are
still
and
the
eyes
close
i
too
a
fool
desired
to
make
love
strong
absence
and
parting
but
the
measure
brimmed
the
dose
is
the
time
too
long
already
though
two
nights
have
hardly
dimmed
my
lonely
eyes
with
the
elusive
sleep
o
i
remember
i
not
wish
again
to
go
with
ardent
limbs
into
this
deep
sea
of
dejection
this
dull
mere
of
pain
we
love
our
safer
loves
upon
the
shore
and
quest
for
inexperienced
joys
no
more
through
the
closed
curtains
comes
the
early
sun
first
a
pale
finger
preluding
the
hand
outside
more
certainly
the
day
begun
where
bright
and
brighter
still
the
chestnuts
stand
broad
candles
lighting
up
at
the
first
fire
i
stir
and
turn
in
my
uneasy
sleep
but
in
my
sorrow
sleep
my
whole
desire
about
the
still
room
small
lights
move
and
creep
silently
stealthily
on
wall
and
chair
till
to
strong
rays
and
shining
lights
they
grow
which
with
their
magic
change
the
waiting
air
and
all
its
sleeping
motes
to
gold
and
throw
a
golden
radiance
on
your
empty
bed
which
wakes
me
with
vain
likeness
to
your
head
vi
i
shall

fifty
miles

dream
of
you
by

the
thick
soft
blankets
drawn
about

for
you
a
nest
of
warm
delight
your
short
crisp
hair

abroad

spilled
upon
the
pillow
whiteness
and
your
eyes
are
quiet
and
the
round
soft
lids
are
filled
with
sleep
but
i
shall
watch
until
sunrise
creeps
into
chilly
clouds
and
heavy
air
across
the
lands
where
you
sleep
and
i
wake
and
i
shall
know

sun
has
seen
you
there
unmoving
though
the
winter
morning
break
next
you
will
lift
your
hands
and
rub
your
eyes
and
turn
to
sleep
again

wake
and
start
and
feel
half
dreaming
with
a
dear
surprise
my
hand
in

sunbeam
touching
at

still
must
your

withhold
your

your

jealous

fair
white
limbs

forms
as

could
fill

life

sweetness
such

yours
as
music
and

expressed

woods
alternately
and

with

sounds
that
never

would
i
now
would
i
be
in
that
removèd
place
where
the
dim
sunlight
hardly
comes
at
all
and
branches
of
the
young
trees
interlace
and
long
swathes
of
the
brambles
twine
and
fall
a
space
between
the
hedgerow
and
a
road
not
trod
by
foot
of
any
known
to
me
where
now
and
then
a
cart
with
scented
load
goes
sleepy
down
the
lane
with
creaking
and
there
i
lie
upon
the
tumbled
leaves
watching
a
square
of
the
all
else
hidden
sky
and
made
such
songs
a
drowsy
mind
believes
to
be
most
perfect
music
so
would
i
keep
my
face
heavenwards
and
bless
eternity
wherein
my
heart
could
be
as
glad
as
this
and
lazily
i
bid
all
men
come
hither
and
in
my
dreams
i
tell
them
what
they
miss
living
in
hate
and
work
and
all
foul
weather
and
still
my
happy
dreams
would
go
like
children
in
a
cowslip
field
chasing
insects
to
and
fro
to
see
what
rare
delights
they
yield
o
i
am
tired
of
working
to
be
cheated
and
sick
of
barriers
that
will
not
fall
of
ancient
prudent
words
too
much
repeated
and
dreams
that
come
not
true
at
all
i
know
too
well
what
things
they
are
that
ail
me
to
fight
is
nothing
but
to
see
thus
at
the
last
my
own
hand
fail
me
is
agony
o
for
that
corner
by
the
hummocked
marshes
visited
hardly
by
the
cynic
sun
where
nothing
clear
and
nothing
bright
or
harsh
is
where
labour
and
the
ache
of
it
are
done
where
naught
is
ended
and
where
naught
begun
a
month
or
twain
to
live
on
honeycomb
is
pleasant
but
to
eat
it
for
a
year
is
simply
beastly
thus
the
poet
spake

how
sticky
all
his
stomach
was
with
hivings
of
ten
thousand

bees
