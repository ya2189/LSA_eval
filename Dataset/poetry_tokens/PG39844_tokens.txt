twilight
auroral
pulsations
thrilled
faintly
and
striking
the
blank
heaving
surface
the
measureless
speed
of
their
motion
now
leaped
into
light
on
the
waters
and
lo
from
the
womb
of
the
waters
upheaved
in
volcanic
convulsion
ribbed
and
ravaged
and
rent
there
rose
bald
peaks
and
the
rocky
heights
of
confederate
mountains
compelling
the
fugitive
vapours
to
take
a

as

grey

limitless
deserts

and
wildernesses
primeval
ii
lo
moving
chaotic
waters
love
dawned
upon
the
seething
waste
transformed
in
ever
new
avatars
it
moved
without
or
pause
or
haste
like
sap
that
moulds
the
leaves
of
may
it
wrought
within
the
ductile
clay
and
vaguely
in
the
pregnant
deep
clasped
by
the
glowing
arms
of
light
from
an
eternity
of
sleep
within
unfathomed
gulfs
of
night
a
pulse
stirred
in
the
plastic
slime
responsive
to
the
rhythm
of
time
enkindled
in
the
mystic
dark
life
built
herself
a
myriad
forms
and
flashing
its
electric
spark
through
films
and
cells
and
pulps
and
worms
flew
shuttlewise
above
beneath
weaving
the
web
of
life
and
death
and
multiplying
in
the
ocean
amorphous
rude
colossal
things
lolled
on
the
ooze
in
lazy
motion
armed
with
grim
jaws
or
uncouth
wings
helpless
to
lift
their
cumbering
bulk
they
lurch
like
some
dismasted
hulk
and
virgin
forest
verdant
plain
the
briny
sea
the
balmy
air
each
blade
of
grass
and
globe
of
rain
and
glimmering
cave
and
gloomy
lair
began
to
swarm
with
beasts
and
birds
with
floating
fish
and
herds
the
lust
of
life
delirious
fires
burned
like
a
fever
in
their
blood
now
pricked
them
on
with
fierce
desires
now
drove
them
famishing
for
food
to
seize
coy
females
in
the
fray
or
hotly
hunted
hunt
for
prey
and
amorously
urged
them
on
in
wood
or
wild
to
court
their
mate
proudly
displaying
in
the
sun
with
antics
strange
and
looks
elate
the
vigour
of
their
mighty
thews
or
charm
of
hues
there
crouching
the
scarlet
bloom
voluptuously
the
leopard
lies
and
through
the
tropic
forest
gloom
the
flaming
of
his
feline
eyes
stirs
with
intoxicating
stress
the
pulses
of
the
leopardess
or
two
swart
bulls
of
age
meet
furiously
with
thunderous
roar
and
lash
together
blind
with
rage
and
clanging
horns
that
fain
would
gore
their
rival
and
so
win
the
prize
of
those
impassive
female
eyes
or
in
the
nuptial
days
of
spring
when
april
kindles
bush
and
brier
like
rainbows
that
have
taken
wing
or
palpitating
gems
of
fire
bright
butterflies
in
one
brief
day
live
but
to
love
and
pass
away
and
herds
of
horses
scour
the
plains
the
thickets
scream
with
bird
and
beast
the
love
of
life
burns
in
their
veins
and
from
the
mightiest
to
the
least
each
preys
upon
the
other
life
in
inextinguishable
strife
war
rages
on
the
teeming
earth
the
hot
and
sanguinary
fight
begins
with
each
new
creature
birth
a
dreadful
war
where
might
is
right
where
still
the
strongest
slay
and
win
where
weakness
is
the
only
sin
there
is
no
truce
to
this
drawn
battle
which
ends
but
to
begin
again
the
drip
of
blood
the
hoarse
the
roar
of
rage
the
shriek
of
pain
are
rife
in
fairest
grove
and
dell
turning
earth
flowery
haunts
to
hell
a
hell
of
hunger
hatred
lust
which
goads
all
creatures
here
below
or
blindworm
wriggling
in
the
dust
or
penguin
in
the
polar
snow
a
hell
where
there
is
none
to
save
where
life
is
life
insatiate
grave
and
in
the
long
portentous
strife
where
types
are
tried
even
as
by
fire
where
life
is
whetted
upon
life
and
step
by
panting
step
mounts
higher
apes
lifting
hairy
arms
now
stand
and
free
the
hand
they
raise
a
light
aërial
house
on
shafts
of
widely
branching
trees
where
harboured
warily
each
spouse
may
feed
her
little
ape
in
peace
green
cradled
in
his
bed
leaves
rustling
lullabies
and
lo
reeking
swarms
of
earth
grim
struggling
in
the
primal
wood
a
new
strange
creature
hath
its
birth
wild
stammering
nameless
shameless
nude
spurred
on
by
want
held
in
by
fear
he
hides
his
head
in
caverns
drear
most
unprotected
of
earth
kin
his
fight
for
life
that
seems
so
vain
sharpens
his
senses
till
within
the
twilight
mazes
of
his
brain
like
embryos
within
the
womb
thought
pushes
feelers
through
the
gloom
and
slowly
in
the
fateful
race
it
grows
unconscious
till
at
length
the
helpless
savage
dares
to
face
the
in
his
grisly
strength
for
stronger
than
its
bulky
thews
he
feels
a
force
that
grows
with
use
from
age
to
dumb
unnumbered
age
by
dim
gradations
long
and
slow
he
reaches
on
from
stage
to
stage
through
fear
and
famine
weal
and
woe
and
compassed
round
with
danger
still
prolongs
his
life
by
craft
and
skill
with
cunning
hand
he
shapes
the
flint
he
carves
the
horn
with
strange
device
he
splits
the
rebel
block
by
dint
of
effort
till
one
day
there
flies
a
spark
of
fire
from
out
the
stone
fire
which
shall
make
the
world
his
own
iii
and
from
the
clash
of
warring
nature

man
day
by
day
wins
his
imperilled
life
for
goaded
on
by
want
he
hunts
the
roe
chases
the
deer
and
lays
the
wild
boar
low
in
his
rude
boat
made
of
the
hollow
trees
he
drifts
adventurous
on
the
unoared
seas
and
as
he
tilts
upon
the
rocking
tide
catches
the
glistening
fish
that
flash
and
glide
innumerably
through
the
waters
wide
he
fire
the
bush
whose
flames
shall
help
him
fel
the
trunks
to
prop
his
roof
where
he
may
dwell
beside
the
bubbling
of
a
crystal
well
sheltered
from
drenching
rains
or
noxious
glare
when
the
sun
holds
the
zenith
delving
there
his
cumbered
wife
whose
multifarious
toil
seems
never
done
breaks
the
rich
virgin
soil
and
in
the
ashes
casts
the
casual
seeds
of
feathered
grass
and
efflorescent
weeds
when
as
with
thanks
the
bounteous
earth
one
morn
returns
lush
blades
of
corn
and
while
the
woman
digs
and
plants
and
twines
to
precious
use
long
reeds
and
pliant
bines
he
having
hit
the
brown
bird
on
the
wing
and
slain
the
roe
returns
at
evening
and
gives
his
spoil
unto
her
to
prepare
the
succulent
wildwood
scented
simmering
fare
while
with
impatient
sniffs
and
his
children
gather
to
his
side
and
when
the
feast
is
done
all
take
their
ease
lulled
by
the
of
the
evening
breeze
and
murmuring
undertones
of
trees
while
here
and
there
through
rifts
of
green
the
sky
casts
its
blue
glance
like
an
eye
but
though
by
stress
of
want
and
poignant
need
man
tames
the
hound
and
rearing
steed
pens
up
the
ram
and
yokes
the
ox
and
through
wide
pastures
shepherds
woolly
flocks
though
age
by
age
through
discipline
of
toil
man
wring
a
richer
harvest
from
the
soil
and
in
the
grim
and
still
renewing
fight
slays
loathly
worms
and
beasts
of
gruesome
might
by
the
bondage
of
the
clan
which
adding
up
the
puny
strength
of
man
makes
thousands
move
with
one
electric
thrill
of
simultaneous
energetic
will
yet
still
behind
the
narrow
borderland
where
in
security
he
seems
to
stand
his
apprehensive
life
is
compassed
round
by
baffling
mysteries
he
can
not
sound
where
big
with
terrors
and
calamities
the
future
like
a
foe
in
ambush
lies
a
muffled
foe
that
seems
to
watch
and
wait
with
the
medusa
eyes
of
stony
great
floods
and
ruin
his
ripening
grain
his
boat
is
shattered
by
the
hurricane
from
the
rent
cloud
the
tameless
lightning
springs
heaven
dragon
with
a
roar
of
wings
and
fires
his
hut
and
simple
household
things
until
before
his
eyes
the
produce
of
long
labour
lies
a
heap
of
ashes
smoking
the
or
now
the
pastures
where
his
flocks
did
graze
parched
withered
shrivelled
by
the
imminent
blaze
of
the
great
ball
of
fire
that
glares
above
glow
dry
like
iron
heated
in
a
stove
turning
upon
themselves
the
tortured
sheep
with
blackening
tongues
drop
heap
on
gasping
heap
their
rotting
flesh
sickens
the
wind
that
moans
and
whistles
poisoned
through
their
chattering
bones
while
the
thin
shepherd
staring
sick
and
gaunt
will
search
the
thorns
for
berries
or
yet
haunt
the
stony
channels
of
some
where
filtering
fresh
perchance
a
liquid
thread
of
water
may
run
now
dark
thickening
with
storm
the
wintry
clouds
will
loom
and
wrap
the
land
in
weeds
of
mournful
gloom
shrouding
the
sun
and
every
lesser
light
till
earth
with
all
her
aging
woods
grows
white
and
hurrying
streams
stop
fettered
in
their
flight
then
famished
beasts
freeze
by
the
frozen
lakes
and
thick
as
leaves
dead
birds
bestrew
the
brakes
and
cowering
blankly
by
the
flickering
flame
man
feels
a
presence
without
form
or
name
when
by
the
bodies
of
his
speechless
dead
in
barbarous
woe
he
bows
his
stricken
head
then
in
the
hunger
of
his
piteous
love
he
sends
his
thought
winged
like
a
carrier
dove
through
the
unanswering
silence
void
and
vast
whence
from
dim
hollows
blows
an
icy
blast
to
bring
some
sign
some
little
sign
at
last
from
his
lost
chiefs
the
beautiful
the
brave
vanished
like
bubbles
on
a
breaking
wave
lost
in
the
unfathomed
darkness
of
the
grave
when
lo
behold
beside
him
in
the
night
softly
beside
him
like
the
noiseless
light
of
moonbeams
moving
the
glimmering
floor
that
come
unbidden
through
the
bolted
door
the
lonely
sleeper
sees
the
lost
one
stand
like
one
returned
from
some
dim
distant
land
bending
towards
him
with
his
outstretched
hand
but
when
he
fain
would
grasp
it
in
his
own
he
melts
into
thin
moonshine
and
is
gone
a
spirit
now
who
on
the
other
shore
of
death
hunts
happily
for
a
son
of
life
but
dogged
while
he
draws
breath
by
her
inseparable
shadow
death
man
feeble
man
whom
unknown
fates
appal
with
prayer
and
praise
seeks
to
propitiate
all
the
spirits
who
for
good
or
evil
plight
bless
him
in
victory
or
in
sickness
smite
those
are
his
dead
who
wrapped
in
grisly
shrouds
now
ride
phantasmal
on
the
rushing
clouds
souls
of
departed
chiefs
whose
livid
forms
he
sees
careering
on
the
reinless
storms
wild
spectral
huntsmen
who
tumultuously
with
loud
halloo
and
shrilly
echoing
cry
follow
the
furious
chase
with
the
whole
pack
of
shadowy
hounds
fierce
yelping
in
the
track
of
wolves
and
bears
as
shadowy
as
the
hosts
who
lead
once
more
as
unsubstantial
ghosts
their
lives
of
old
as
restlessly
they
fly
across
the
wildernesses
of
the
sky
when
the
wild
hunt
is
done
shall
they
not
rest
their
heads
upon
some
maiden
breast
and
quaff
their
honeyed
mead
with
godlike
zest
in
halls
whence
they
may
see
the
earth
and
marvellous
secrets
of
the
sea
whereon
the
clouds
will
lie
with
grey
wings
furled
and
in
whose
depths
voluminously
curled
the
serpent
looms
whose
girth
engirds
the
world
far
far
above
now
in
supernal
power
those
spirits
rule
the
sunshine
and
the
shower
how
shall
he
win
their
favour
yea
how
move
to
pity
the
unpitying
gods
above
the
dæmon
rulers
of
life
fitful
dream
who
sway
men
destinies
and
still
would
seem
to
treat
them
lightly
as
a
game
of
chance
the
sport
of
whim
and
blindfold
circumstance
the
irresponsible
capricious
gods
so
quick
to
please
or
anger
whose
sharp
rods
are
storms
and
lightnings
launched
from
cloven
skies
who
feast
upon
the
shuddering
victim
cries
the
smell
of
blood
and
human
sacrifice
but
ever
as
man
grows
they
grow
with
him
terrific
cruel
gentle
bright
or
dim
with
eyes
of
mercy
hands
of
wrath
they
hover
his
path
and
changing
with
the
gazer
borrow
light
from
their
rapt
devotee
adoring
sight
and
ormuzd
ashtaroth
osiris
baal
love
spending
gods
and
gods
of
blood
and
wail
look
down
upon
their
suppliant
from
the
skies
with
his
own
magnified
responsive
eyes
for
man
from
want
and
pressing
hunger
freed
begins
to
feel
another
kind
of
need
and
in
his
shaping
brain
and
through
his
eyes
nature
awakening
sees
her
skies
the
sun
his
isled
in
space
the
moon
the
measurer
of
his
span
of
days
the
immemorial
stars
who
pierce
his
night
with
inklings
of
things
vast
and
infinite
all
shows
of
heaven
and
earth
that
move
and
pass
take
form
within
his
brain
as
in
a
glass
the
tidal
thunder
of
the
sea
now
roars
and
breaks
symphonious
on

lull

where
the

sighing
bends
above

woman
lying

in
spasms
of
anguish
crying
shuddering
through

frame
as
from

struck
the

bedded

thou
paradise
whence
man
can
be
driven
where
severed
from

still
in
the

he
yet
may
reach
that
shore
where
want

there
drops

soul
the
balm
of

divine
control

rapt
absorption
in
the

the

our

narrow

with
an
infinitude
on

receding
luminously
from

lo
there
thy

forsaken
paradise
subsideth
like
some
visionary

while
glimmering
faint
the
future
promised
land
illusive
from
the

seems
fain
to

this
hour
alone
hope
broken

and
joy
now
gleams
before
now
in

like
mirage
mocking
in
some
waste
afar
dissolving
into
air
as
we
draw
near
beyond
our
steps
the
path
is
the
shadow
lying
only
where
we
are
the
ascent
of
man
part
ii
love
is
for
ever
poor
and
so
far
from
being
delicate
and
beautiful
as
mankind
imagined
he
is
squalid
and
withered
homeless
and
unsandalled
he
sleeps
without
covering
before
the
doors
and
in
the
unsheltered
plato
pilgrim
through
the
winding
mazes
of
windy
streets
blindly
i
hurried
i
knew
not
whither
through
the
ways
of
the
brain
thus
fleets
a
fluttering
dream
driven
hither
and
the
fitful
flare
of
the
moon
fled
fast
like
a
sickly
smile
now
seeming
to
wither
now
dark
like
a
scowl
in
the
hurrying
blast
as
ominous
shadows
swept
over
the
roofs
where
white
as
a
ghost
the
scared
moonlight
had
passed
curses
came
mingled
with
wails
and
reproofs
with
doors
banging
to
and
the
crashing
of
glass
with
the
baying
of
dogs
and
the
clatter
of
hoofs
with
the
rush
of
the
river
as
huddling
its
mass
of
weltering
water
towards
the
deep
ocean
bridges
its
eddies
did
pass
a
hubbub
of
voices
in
savage
commotion
was
mixed
with
the
storm
in
a
chaos
of
sound
and
thrilled
as
with
ague
in
shuddering
emotion
i
fled
as
the
hunted
hare
flees
from
the
hound
past
churches
whose
bells
were
tumultuously
ringing
the
year
in
and
clashing
in
concord
around
past
the
deaf
walls
of
dungeons
whose
curses
seemed
clinging
to
the
tempest
that
shivered
and
shrieked
in
amazement
past
brightly
lit
mansions
whence
music
and
singing
came
borne
like
a
scent
through
the
casement
to
vaults
in
whose
shadow
wild
outcasts
were
hiding
their
misery
deep
in
the
gloom
of
the
basement
by
vociferous
taverns
where
women
were
biding
with
features
all
withered
distorted
aghast
some
sullenly
silent
some
brutally
chiding
some
reeling
away
into
gloom
as
i
passed
on
on
through
and
places
where
throned
in
rich
temples
resplendent
and
vast
the
lord
of
the
city
is
deafened
with
praises
as
worshipping
multitudes
kneel
as
of
old
nor
care
for
the
crowds
of
cadaverous
faces
the
men
that
are
marred
and
the
maids
that
are
sold
inarticulate
masses
promiscuously
jumbled
and
crushed
their
juggernaut
idol
of
gold
lost
lives
of
great
cities
bespattered
and
tumbled
black
rags
the
rain
soaks
the
wind
whips
like
a
knout
were
crouched
in
the
streets
there
and
them
nigh
stumbled
a
swarm
of
light
maids
as
they
tripped
to
some
rout
the
silk
of
their
raiment
voluptuously
hisses
and
flaps
the
flags
as
loud
laughing
they
flout
the
men
they
satiate
with
kisses
for
the
pearls
and
the
diamonds
that
make
them
more
fair
for
the
flash
of
large
jewels
that
fire
them
with
blisses
for
the
glitter
of
gold
in
the
gold
of
their
hair
they
smiled
and
they
cozened
their
bold
eyes
shone
brightly
and
lightened
with
laughter
as
lit
by
the
flare
of
the
they
footed
it
lightly
or
closely
enlacing
and
bowered
in
gloom
with
mouth
pressed
to
hot
mouth
their
parched
lips
drain
nightly
the
of
pleasure
their
doom
brief
lives
like
bright
rockets
which
aridly
glowing
fall
burnt
out
to
ashes
and
reel
to
the
tomb
on
on
loud
and
louder
the
rough
night
was
blowing
shrill
singing
was
mixed
with
strange
cries
of
despair
and
high
overhead
the
black
sky
redly
glowing
loomed
over
the
city
one
ominous
glare
as
dark
yawning
funnels
from
foul
throats
for
ever
belched
smoke
grimly
flaming
which
outraged
the
air
on
on
by
long
quays
where
the
lamps
in
the
river
were
writhing
like
serpents
that
hiss
ere
they
drown
and
poplars
with
palsy
seemed
coldly
to
shiver
on
on
to
the
bare
desert
end
of
the
town
when
lo
the
wind
stopped
like
a
heart
that
ceased
beating
and
nought
but
the
waters
white
foaming
and
brown
were
heard
as
to
seaward
their
currents
went
fleeting
but
hark
the
lull
breaks
a
desolate
moan
like
a
little
lost
lamb
that
is
timidly
bleating
when
strayed
from
the
shepherd
it
staggers
alone
by
tracks
which
the
mountain
streams
shake
with
their
thunder
where
death
seems
to
gape
from
each
boulder
and
stone
i
turned
to
the
murmur
the
clouds
swept
asunder
and
wheeled
like
white
around
the
white
moon
and
the
moon
like
a
white
maid
looked
down
in
mute
wonder
on
a
boy
whose
wan
eyelids
were
closed
as
in
swoon
half
nude
on
the
ground
he
lay
wasted
and
chilly
and
torn
as
with
thorns
and
sharp
brambles
of
june
his
hair
like
a
flame
which
at
twilight
burns
stilly
in
a
halo
of
light
round
his
temples
was
blown
and
his
tears
fell
like
rain
on
a
lily
where
he
lay
on
the
cold
ground
abandoned
alone
with
heart
moved
towards
him
in
wondering
pity
i
tenderly
seized
his
thin
hand
with
my
own
crying
child
say
how
thou
so
far
from
the
city
how
thou
alone
in
such
pitiful
plight
all
thy
feet
with
rags
squalid
and
gritty
a
waif
by
the
wayside
unhoused
in
the
night
then
rose
he
and
lifted
the
bright
locks
storm
driven
which
flamed
round
his
forehead
and
clouded
his
sight
and
mournful
as
meres
on
a
moorland
at
even
his
blue
eyes
flashed
wildly
through
tears
as
they
fell
strange
eyes
full
of
horror
yet
fuller
of
heaven
like
eyes
that
from
heaven
have
looked
upon
hell
the
eyes
of
an
angel
whose
depths
show
where
burning
and
lost
in
the
pit
toss
the
angels
that
fell
ah
wailed
he
in
tones
full
of
agonized
yearning
like
the
plaintive
lament
of
a
sickening
dove
on
a
shore
whence
it
sees
past
returning
the
wings
of
the
wild
flock
fast
fading
above
as
they
melt
on
the
like
in
motion
so
sadly
he
wailed
i
am
love
i
am
love
behold
me
cast
out
as
weed
spurned
of
the
ocean
half
nude
on
the
bare
ground
and
covered
with
scars
i
perish
of
cold
here
and
choked
with
emotion
gave
a
sob
at
the
low
sob
a
shower
of
stars
broke
shuddering
from
heaven
pale
flaming
and
fell
where
the
roared
as
with
rumours
of
wars
be
these
god
tears
i
cried
as
my
tears
to
well
ah
love
i
have
sought
thee
in
temples
and
towers
in
shrines
where
men
pray
and
in
marts
where
they
sell
in
tapestried
chambers
made
tropic
with
flowers
where
women
soft
breathing
of
spice
lay
languidly
lapped
in
the
showers
which
gladdened
and
maddened
their
amorous
eyes
i
have
looked
for
thee
vainly
in
churches
where
beaming
the
saints
glowed
embalmed
in
a
prism
of
dyes
where
wave
over
wave
the
rapt
music
went
streaming
with
breakers
of
sound
in
full
anthems
elate
i
have
asked
but
none
knew
thee
or
knew
but
thy
seeming
a
mask
in
thy
likeness
on
high
seats
of
state
and
they
bound
it
with
gold
and
they
crowned
it
with
glory
this
thing
they
called
love
which
was
bond
slave
to
hate
and
they
bowed
down
before
it
with
brown
heads
and
hoary
they
worshipped
it
nightly
loud
hymning
its
praise
while
out
in
the
cold
blast
none
heeding
its
story
love
staggers
an
outcast
with
lust
in
its
place
love
shivered
and
sighed
like
a
reed
that
is
shaken
and
lifting
his
face
to
my
face
nay
if
of
the
world
i
must
needs
die
forsaken
say
thou
wilt
not
leave
me
to
dearth
and
despair
to
thy
heart
to
thy
home
let
the
exile
be
taken
and
feed
me
and
shelter
where
outcast
ah
where
like
thee
i
am
homeless
and
spurned
of
all
mortals
the
house
of
my
fathers
yawns
wide
to
the
air
stalks
desolation
across
the
void
portals
hope
lies
aghast
on
the
ruinous
floor
the
halls
that
were
thronged
once
with
immortals
with
gods
the
and
roar
with
fauns
of
the
forest
and
nymphs
of
the
river
are
cleft
as
if
lightning
had
struck
to
their
core
the
luminous
ceilings
where
soaring
for
ever
dim
hosts
of
plumed
angels
smoked
up
to
the
sky
with
faces
that
yearned
to
the
giver
as
vapours
of
morning
the
sun
draws
on
high
now
ravaged
with
rain
hear
the
hollow
winds
whistle
through
rifts
in
the
rafters
which
echo
their
cry
blest
walls
that
were
vowed
to
the
virgin
now
bristle
with
weeds
of
sick
scarlet
and
moss
and
stained
on
the
ground
choked
with
thorn
and
rank
thistle
rots
a
christ
on
a
mouldering
cross
from
the
house
of
my
fathers
distraught
with
a
pang
of
immense
irredeemable
loss
on
my
wearying
pilgrimage
blindly
i
started
to
seek
thee
oh
love
in
high
places
and
low
and
instead
of
the
glories
for
ever
departed
to
warm
my
starved
life
in
thy
mightier
glow
for
i
deemed
thee
a
presence
ringed
round
with
all
splendour
with
a
sceptre
in
hand
and
a
crown
on
thy
brow
and
behold
thou
art
helpless
most
helpless
to
tender
thy
service
to
others
who
needest
their
care
yea
now
that
i
find
thee
a
weak
child
and
slender
exposed
to
the
blast
of
the
merciless
air
like
a
lamb
that
is
shorn
like
a
leaf
that
is
shaken
what
love
now
is
left
but
to
die
in
despair
for
death
is
the
mother
of
all
the
forsaken
the
grave
a
strait
bed
where
she
rocks
them
to
rest
and
sleep
from
whose
silence
they
never
shall
waken
the
balm
of
oblivion
she
sheds
on
their
breast
then
i
seized
him
and
led
to
the
brink
of
the
river
where
two
seagulls
were
fluttering
west
and
the
lamplight
in
drowning
seemed
coldly
to
shiver
and
clasping
love
close
for
the
leap
from
on
high
said
let
us
go
hence
love
go
home
love
for
ever
for
life
casts
us
forth
and
man
dooms
us
to
die
as
if
stung
by
a
snake
the
child
shuddered
and
started
and
clung
to
me
close
with
a
passionate
cry
stay
with
me
stay
with
me
poor
pain
if
not
pleasure
we
two
will
divide
though
with
the
sins
of
the
world
i
have
smarted
though
with
the
shame
of
the
world
thou
art
dyed
weak
as
i
am
on
thy
breast
i
recover
worn
as
thou
art
thou
shalt
bloom
as
my
bride
bloom
as
the
flower
of
the
world
for
the
lover
whom
thou
hast
found
in
a
lost
little
child
and
as
he
kissed
my
lips
over
and
over
child
now
or
man
was
it
who
thus
beguiled
even
as
i
looked
on
him
love
waxing
slowly
grew
as
a
little
cloud
floating
enisled
which
spreads
out
aloft
in
the
blue
sky
till
solely
it
fills
the
deep
ether
tremendous
in
height
with
and
pinnacles
wholly
invisible
vanishing
light
within
light
so
changing
waxed
love
till
he
towered
before
me
outgrowing
my
lost
gods
in
stature
and
might
as
he
grew
as
he
drew
me
a
great
awe
came
me
and
stammering
i
shook
as
i
questioned
his
name
but
gently
bowed
me
he
soothèd
and
bore
me
yea
bore
once
again
to
the
haunts
whence
i
came
by
dark
ways
and
dreary
by
rough
roads
and
gritty
to
the
penfolds
of
sin
to
the
purlieus
of
shame
and
lo
as
we
went
through
the
city
where
women
bring
forth
and
men
labour
in
vain
weak
love
grew
so
great
in
his
passion
of
pity
that
all
who
beheld
him
were
born
once
again
would
we
but
love
what
will
not
pass
away
the
sun
that
on
each
morning
shines
as
clear
as
when
it
rose
first
on
the
world
first
year
the
fresh
green
leaves
that
rustle
on
the
spray
the
sun
will
shine
the
leaves
will
be
as
gay
when
graves
are
full
of
all
our
hearts
held
dear
when
not
a
soul
of
those
who
loved
us
here
not
one
is
left
us
creatures
of
decay
yea
love
the
abiding
in
the
universe
which
was
before
and
will
be
after
us
nor
yet
for
ever
hanker
and
vainly
cry
for
human
love
the
beings
that
change
or
die
die
change
forget
to
care
so
is
a
curse
yet
cursed
we
be
rather
than
not
care
thus
divest
thyself
o
soul
of
vain
desire
bid
hope
farewell
dismiss
all
coward
fears
take
leave
of
empty
laughter
emptier
tears
and
quench
for
ever
quench
the
wasting
fire
wherein
this
heart
as
in
a
funeral
pyre
aye
burns
yet
is
consumed
not
years
on
years
moaning
with
memories
in
thy
maddened
ears
let
at
thy
word
like
refluent
waves
retire
enter
thy
soul
vast
realm
as
sovereign
lord
and
like
that
angel
with
the
flaming
sword
wave
off
life
clinging
hands
then
chains
will
fall
from
the
poor
slave
of
self
hard
tyranny
and
thou
a
ripple
rounded
by
the
sea
in
rapture
lost
be
lapped
within
the
all
from
out
the
font
of
being
undefiled
a
life
hath
been
upheaved
with
struggle
and
pain
safe
in
her
arms
a
mother
holds
again
that
dearest
miracle
a
child
to
moans
of
anguish
terrible
and
wild
as
shrieks
the
through
an
pane
pure
heaven
succeeds
and
after
fiery
strain
victorious
woman
smiles
serenely
mild
yea
shall
she
not
rejoice
shall
not
her
frame
thrill
with
a
mystic
rapture
at
this
birth
the
soul
now
kindled
by
her
vital
flame
may
it
not
prove
a
gift
of
priceless
worth
some
saviour
of
his
kind
whose
starry
fame
shall
bring
a
brightness
to
the
darkened
earth
the
ascent
of
man
part
iii
our
spirits
have
climbed
high
by
reason
of
the
passion
of
our
grief
and
from
the
top
of
sense
looked
over
sense
to
the
significance
and
heart
of
things
rather
than
things
themselves
browning
leading
of
through
a
twilight
land
a
moaning
region
thick
with
sighs
that
shook
the
trembling
air
land
of
shadows
whose
dim
crew
was
legion
lost
i
hurried
hunted
by
despair
quailed
my
heart
like
an
expiring
splendour
fitful
flicker
of
a
faltering
fire
smitten
chords
which
render
rhythms
of
anguish
from
a
breaking
lyre
love
had
left
me
in
a
land
of
shadows
lonely
on
the
ruins
of
delight
and
i
grieved
with
tearless
grief
of
widows
moaned
as
orphans
homeless
in
the
night
love
had
left
me
knocking
at
death
portal
shone
his
star
and
vanished
from
my
sky
and
i
cried
since
love
even
love
is
mortal
take
unmake
and
break
me
let
me
die
then
the
twilight
grisly
veils
dividing
there
stole
one
the
plain
wavering
mists
for
ever
round
it
gliding
hid
the
face
i
strove
to
scan
in
vain
spake
the
veiled
one
solitary
weeper
the
myriad
mourners
but
one
come
and
thou
shalt
see
the
awful
reaper
evil
reaping
all
beneath
the
sun
on
my
hand
the
hand
did
fasten
as
it
murmured
up
and
follow
me
the
thickly
peopled
earth
we
hasten
yet
more
thickly
packed
with
misery
and
i
followed
ever
in
the
shadow
of
that
looming
form
i
fared
along
now
mountains
now
through
wood
and
meadow
or
through
cities
with
their
surging
throng
with
none
other
for
a
friend
or
fellow
those
relentless
footsteps
were
my
guide
to
the
echoing
with
the
hollow
immemorial
moaning
of
the
tide
laughed
the
sunlight
on
the
living
ocean
danced
and
rocked
itself
upon
the
spray
and
its
shivered
beams
in
twinkling
motion
gleamed
like
in
the
milky
way
lo
beneath
those
waters
surging
flowing
i
beheld
the
deep
fantastic
bowers
shapes
which
seemed
alive
and
yet
were
growing
on
their
stalks
like
animated
flowers
sentient
flowers
which
seemed
to
glow
and
glimmer
soft
as
ocean
blush
of
indian
shells
white
as
in
the
moony
shimmer
of
those
dells
yet
even
here
as
in
the
panther
in
disguise
the
eternal
hunger
lay
for
each
feathery
anther
lay
in
ambush
waiting
for
its
prey
tiniest
jewelled
fish
that
flashed
like
lightning
blindly
drawn
came
darting
through
the
wave
when
a
stifling
sack
above
them
tightening
closed
the
living
grave
now
we
fared
through
forest
glooms
primeval
through
whose
leaves
the
light
but
rarely
shone
where
the
buttressed
looked
coeval
with
the
stone
where
from
stem
to
stem
their
tendrils
looping
coiled
the
lithe
lianas
fold
on
fold
or
in
cataracts
of
verdure
drooping
from
on
high
their
billowy
leafage
rolled
where
beneath
the
dusky
woodland
cover
while
the
holds
all
living
things
butterflies
of
tropic
splendour
hover
in
a
maze
of
wings
some
like
stars
light
up
their
own
green
heaven
some
are
spangled
like
a
golden
toy
or
like
flowers
from
their
foliage
driven
in
the
fiery
ecstasy
of
joy
but
the
forest
slumber
rudely
breaking
through
the
silence
rings
a
piercing
yell
at
the
cry
unnumbered
beasts
awaking
with
their
howls
the
loud
confusion
swell
is
the
cry
of
some
frail
creature
panting
in
the
tiger
lacerating
grip
in
its
flesh
carnivorous
teeth
implanting
while
the
blood
smokes
round
his
wrinkled
lip
is
the
scream
some
bird
in
terror
utters
with
its
wings
weighed
down
by
leaden
fears
as
from
bough
to
downward
bough
it
flutters
where
the
snake
its
glistening
crest
uprears
eyes
of
sluggish
greed
through
rank
weeds
stealing
breath
whose
venomous
fumes
mount
through
the
air
till
benumbed
the
helpless
victim
reeling
drops
convulsed
into
the
reptile
snare
now
we
fared
sweltering
wastes
whose
steaming
clouds
of
tawny
sand
the
wanderer
blind
herds
of
horses
with
their
long
manes
streaming
snorted
thirstily
against
the
wind
the
waste
they
scoured
in
shadowy
numbers
gasped
for
springs
their
raging
thirst
to
cool
and
like
sick
men
mocked
in
fevered
slumbers
stoop
to
drink
and
find
a
phantom
pool
what
of
antelopes
crunched
by
the
leopard
what
if
hounds
run
down
the
timid
hare
what
though
sheep
strayed
from
the
faithful
shepherd
perish
helpless
in
the
lion
lair
the
sun
shines
on
unheeding
in
the
night
shines
the
unruffled
moon
though
on
earth
brute
myriads
preying
bleeding
put
creation
harshly
out
of
tune
cried
i
turning
to
the
shrouded
figure
oh
in
mercy
veil
this
cruel
strife
sanguinary
orgies
which
disfigure
the
green
ways
of
labyrinthine
life
from
the
needs
and
greeds
of
primal
passion
from
the
serpent
track
and
lion
den
to
the
world
our
human
hands
did
fashion
lead
me
to
the
kindly
haunts
of
men
and
through
fields
of
corn
we
passed
together
orange
golden
in
the
brooding
heat
where
brown
reapers
in
the
harvest
weather
cut
ripe
swathes
of
downward
rustling
wheat
in
the
orchards
dangling
red
and
yellow
clustered
fruit
weighed
down
the
bending
sprays
on
a
hundred
hills
the
vines
grew
mellow
in
the
warmth
of
fostering
autumn
days
through
the
air
the
shrilly
twittering
swallows
flashed
their
nimble
shadows
on
the
leas
cows
were
glassed
in
golden
shallows
purple
clover
hummed
with
restless
bees
herdsmen
drove
the
cattle
from
the
mountain
to
the
fold
the
shepherd
drove
his
flocks
village
girls
drew
water
from
the
fountain
village
yokels
piled
the
shocks
from
the
white
town
dozing
in
the
valley
round
its
vast
cathedral
solemn
shade
citizens
strolled
down
the
walnut
alley
where
youth
courted
and
glad
childhood
played
peace
on
earth
i
murmured
let
us
linger
here
the
wage
of
life
seems
good
at
least
as
i
spake
the
veiled
one
raised
a
finger
where
the
moon
broke
flowering
in
the
east
faintly
muttering
from
deep
mountain
ranges
muffled
sounds
rose
hoarsely
on
the
night
as
the
crash
of
foundering
avalanches
wakes
hoarse
echoes
in
each
alpine
height
near
and
nearer
sounds
the
roaring
thunder
mortal
thunder
crashes
through
the
vale
lightning
flash
of
muskets
breaks
from
under
groves
once
haunted
by
the
nightingale

clutch
madly
at
each
weapon

crouch
in
cellars
under
roofs
for
the

circled
by
their

the

with
clang
of
trampling
hoofs
shot
on

the
volleys

shrilly
whistling

the
murderous
balls
fiercely
roars
the
tumult
of
the
battle
round
the

horror
horror
the
fair
town
is
burning
flames
burst
forth
wild
sparks
and
ashes
fly
with
her
children

the
green
earth
turning
too
the
sky
crackling

the
streets
from
the
lone
steeple
the
great
clock
booms
forth
its
ancient
chime
and
its
dolorous
quarters
warn
the
people
of
the
conquering
troops
that
march
with
time
fallen
lies
the
fair
old
town
its
houses
charred
and
ruined
gape
in
smoking
heaps
here
with
shouts
a
ruffian
band
carouses
there
an
outraged
woman
vainly
weeps
in
the
fields
where
the
ripe
corn
lies
mangled
where
the
wounded
groan
beneath
the
dead

red
poppies
with
a
guiltier
red
there
the

his

comes
circling
from
afar

vile
things

batten
on

what
they
ploughed
and
planted
the
unhappy
peasants
shall
not
reap
sickening
of
strange
meats
and
fever
haunted

their
graves
they
prematurely
creep
hence
i
cried
in
unavailing
pity
let
us
flee
these
scenes
of
monstrous
strife
seek
the
pale
of
some
imperial
city
where
the
law
rules
starlike
man
life
straightway
floating
blue
sea
and
river
we
were
plunged
into
a
roaring
cloud
wherethrough
lamps
in
ague
fits
did
shiver
the
surging
multitudinous
crowd
piles
of
stone
their
walls
uprearing
flashed
in
luminous
lines
along
the
night
jets
of
flame
spasmodically
flaring
splashed
black
pavements
with
a
sickly
light
fabulous
gems
shone
here
and
glowing
coral
shimmering
stuffs
from
many
an
eastern
loom
and
vast
piles
of
tropic
fruits
and
floral
marvels
seemed
to
mock
november
gloom
but
what
prowls
near
princely
mart
and
dwelling
whence
through
many
a
thundering
thoroughfare
rich
folk
roll
on
cushions
softly
swelling
to
the
feast
and
sunday
prayer
yea
who
prowl
there
and
pallid
breathing
nightmares
limned
upon
the
gloom
is
but
human
rubbish
gaunt
and
squalid
whom
their
country
spurns
for
lack
of
room
in
their
devious
track
we
mutely
follow
mutely
climb
dim
flights
of
oozy
stairs
where
through
mizzling
roof
the
yellow
pestilent
fog
blends
with
the
fetid
air
through
the
unhinged
door
discordant
slamming
ring
the
gruesome
sounds
of
savage
strife
howls
of
babes
the
drunken
father
damning
of
the
wife
children
feebly
crying
on
their
mother
in
a
wailful
chorus
give
us
food
man
and

glaring
at
each
other
like
two
gaunt
wolves
with
a
famished
brood
till
he
snatched
a
stick
and
madly
staring
struck
her
blow
on
blow
upon
the
head
and
she
reeling
back
gasped
hardly
caring
ah
you
done
it
now
jim
and
was
dead
dead
dead
dead
the
miserable
creature
never
to
feel
hunger
cruel
fang
wring
the

of
rebellious
nature
that
her
infants
might
be
spared
the
pang
dead

luck
to
her
the
man
teeth
chattered
stared
he
with
blank
eyes
and
hard
then
his
frame
with
one
big
sob
nigh
shattered
fled
and
cut
his
throat
down
in
the
yard
dark
the
night
the
children
wail
forsaken
crane
their
wrinkled
necks
and
cry
for
food
drop
off
into
fitful
sleep
or
waken
trembling
like
a
sparrow
ravished
brood
dark
the
night
the
rain
falls
on
the
ashes
feebly
hissing
on
the
feeble
heat
filters
through
the
ceiling
drops
in
splashes
on
the
little
children
naked
feet
dark
the
night
the
children
wail
forsaken
is
there
none
ah
none
to
heed
their
moan
yea
at
dawn
one
little
one
is
taken
four
poor
souls
are
left
but
one
is
gone
gone
escaped
flown
from
the
shame
and
sorrow
waiting
for
them
at
life
sombre
gate
but
the
hand
of
merciless
drags
the
others
shuddering
to
their
fate
but
one
came
a
girlish
thing
a
creature
flung
by
wanton
hands
lust
and
crime
a
poor
outcast
yet
by
right
of
nature
sweet
as
odour
of
the
upland
thyme
scapegoat
of
a
people
sins
and
hunted
howled
at
hooted
to
the
wilderness
to
that
wilderness
of
deaf
hearts
blunted
to
the
depths
of
woman
dumb
distress
jetsam
flotsam
of
the
monster
city
spurned
defiled
reviled
that
outcast
came
to
those
babes
that
whined
for
love
and
pity
gave
them
bread
bought
with
the
wage
of
shame
gave
them
bread
and
gave
them
warm
maternal
kisses
not
on
sale
for
any
price
yea
a
spark
a
flash
of
some
eternal
sympathy
shone
through
those
haunted
eyes
ah
perchance
through
her
dark
life
confusion
through
the
haste
and
taste
of
fevered
hours
gusts
of
memory
on
her
youth
pollution
blew
forgotten
scents
of
faded
flowers
and
she
saw
the
cottage
near
the
wild
wood
with
its
lichened
roof
and
latticed
panes
strayed
once
more
through
golden
fields
of
childhood
hyacinth
dells
and
lanes
heard
once
more
the
song
of
nesting
thrushes
and
the
blackbird
long
mellifluous
note
felt
once
more
the
glow
of
maiden
blushes
burn
through
rosy
cheek
and
milkwhite
throat
in
that
orchard
where
the
apple
blossom
lightly
shaken
fluttered
on
her
hair
as
the
heart
was
fluttering
in
her
bosom
when
her
sweetheart
came
and
kissed
her
there
often
came
he
in
the
moonlit
twilight
often
pledged
his
word

she
was
a

the
offspring
of

lord

be
broken

break

brief
kaleidoscopic

in

your

glimmering

you
stand
turning

cease
wild

fluttering
flying
palely
on

green

lying
vanishing
like

swift
as
joy
to

and
go
a
thrush
alit
on
a

and
lightly
clinging

rocked
in
its
singing
as
the
rapturous
notes

loud
and
gay
and
with
liquid
shakes
and
trills
and
breaks
rippled

green
grove

crispeth
the

where
lispeth
the
shy
little
bird
with
its

above
two
voices
that
mingle
and
make
but
a
single
hymn
of
rejoicing
in

gait
sam
leads
the
team
he
stoops
i
the
shoulders
worn
with
work
not
years
one
only
passion
has
he
it
would
seem
the
passion
for
the
horses
which
he
rears
he
names
them
as
one
would
some
household
pet
may
violet
he
thinks
them
quite
as
sensible
as
men
as
nice
as
women
but
not
near
so
skittish
he
fondles
cossets
scolds
them
now

gravely
talks
as

never

nor
yet
elate
like
nature
self
he
goes
his
punctual
round
on
sundays
smoking
by
his
garden
gate
for
hours
he
stand
with
eyes
upon
the
ground
like
some
tired
in
a
field
alone
and
still
as
stone
yet
howsoever
stolid
he
may
seem
sam
has
his
tragic
background
weird
and
wild
like
some
adventure
in
a
drunkard
dream
impossible
you
swear
for
one
so
mild
yet
village
gossips
dawdling
their
ale
still
tell
the
tale
in
his
young
days
sam
loved
a
a
girl
with
happy
eyes
like
hazel
brooks
that
dance
i
the
sun
cheeks
as
if
newly
made
of
pouting
roses
coyly
hid
in
nooks
and
warm
brown
hair
that
wantoned
into
curl
a
girl
sam
came
while
the
year
was
blithe
when
wet
browed
mowers
stepping
out
in
tune
with
level
stroke
and
rhythmic
swing
of
scythe
smote
down
the
proud
grass
in
the
pomp
of
june
and
wagons
over
seemed
to
sway
with
loads
of
hay
the
elder
bush
beside
the
orchard
croft
brimmed
over
with
its
bloom
like
curds
and
cream
from
out
grey
nests
high
in
the
granary
loft
black
clusters
of
small
heads
with
callow
scream
peered
as
swallows
flashed
along
to
feed
their
young
ripening
towards
the
harvest
swelled
the
wheat
lush
cherries
dangled
the
latticed
panes
the
roads
were
baking
in
the
windless
heat
and
dust
had
floured
the
glossy
country
lanes
one
sunday
afternoon
the
last
of
june
when
with
his
thumping
heart
all
out
of
joint
and
pulses
beating
like
a
stroller
drum
sam
screwed
his
courage
to
the
sticking
point
and
asked
his
blushing
sweetheart
if
she
come
to
titsey
fair
he
meant
to
coax
coy
may
to
name
the
day
but
her
rich
master
snapped
his
thumb
and
swore
the
girl
was
not
for
him
should
not
go
out
and
whistling
to
his
dogs
the
door
close
in
sam
face
and
left
him
dazed
without
in
the
fierce
sunshine
blazing
in
his
path
like
fire
of
wrath
unheeding
he
went
forth
with
hot
wild
eyes
past
fields
of
feathery
oats
and
clover
unheeded
larks
soared
singing
to
the
skies
or
rang
the
plaintive
cry
of
rising
plover
unheeded
pheasants
with
a
startled
sound
whirred
from
the
ground
on
on
he
went
by
acres
full
of
grain
by
trees
and
meadows
reeling
past
his
sight
as
to
a
man
whirled
onwards
in
a
train
the
land
with
spinning
hedgerows
seems
in
flight
at
last
he
stopped
and
leant
a
long
long
while
against
a
stile
hours
passed
the
clock
struck
ten
a
hush
of
night
in
which
even
wind
and
water
seemed
at
peace
but
here
and
there
a
glimmering
cottage
light
shone
like
a
glowworm
through
the
slumberous
trees
or
from
some
homestead
through
the
dark
a
bark
but
all
at
once
sam
gave
a
stifled
cry
there
fire
he
muttered
fire
upon
the
hills
no
fire
but
as
the
late
moon
rose
on
high
her
light
looked
as
through
belching
mills
no
fire
but
moonlight
turning
in
his
path
to
fire
of
wrath
he
looked
abroad
with
eyes
that
gave
the
mist
a
lurid
tinge
above
the
breadths
of
grain
owned
by
may
master
then
he
shook
his
fist
still
muttering
fire
and
measured
again
the
road
he
come
where
lapped
in
moonlight
lay
huge
ricks
of
hay
there
he
paused
glaring
then
he
turned
and
waned
like
mist
into
the
misty
night
where
the
pale
silvery
fields
were
blotched
and
stained
with
strange
fantastic
shadows
but
what
light
is
that
which
leaps
up
flickering
lithe
and
long
with
licking
tongue
hungry
it
darts
and
hisses
twists
and
turns
and
with
each
minute
shoots
up
high
and
higher
till
wrapped
in
flames
the
mighty
hayrick
burns
and
sends
its
sparks
on
to
a
neighbouring
byre
where
frightened
at
the
hot
tremendous
glow
the
cattle
low
and
rick
on
rick
takes
fire
and
next
a
stye
whence
through
the
smoke
the
little
pigs
rush
out
the
barks
then
with
a
startled
cry
the
window
is
flung
open
shout
on
shout
wakes
the
farm
where
man
and
maid
start
up
dismayed
and
with
wild
faces
wavering
in
the
glare
in
nightcaps
bedgowns
clothes
half
huddled
on
some
to
the
pump
some
to
the
tear
in
frantic
haste
while
others
splashing
run
with
pails
or
turn
the
hose
with
face
upon
the
blaze
at
last
when
some
wan
streaks
began
to
show
in
the
chill
darkness
of
the
sky
the
fire
went
out
subdued
but
for
the
sputtering
glow
of
sparks
among
wet
ashes
barn
and
byre
were
safe
but
swallowed
all
the
summer
math
by
fire
of
wrath
still
haggard
from
the
night
wild
work
and
pale
and
women
stood
in
whispering
knots
regaled
with
foaming
mugs
of
ale
firing
his
oaths
about
like
vicious
shots
the
farmer
hissed
out
now
and
then
gad
damn
it
that
black
sam
they
had
him
up
and
taxed
him
with
the
crime
denying
naught
he
sulked
and
held
his
peace
and
so
a
branded
convict
in
due
time
handcuffed
and
cropped
they
shipped
him
seven
years
of
shame
sliced
from
his
labourer
life
as
with
a
knife
but
through
it
all
the
image
of
a
girl
with
hazel
eyes
like
pebbled
waters
clear
and
warm
brown
hair
that
wantoned
into
curl
kept
his
heart
sweet
through
many
a
galling
year
like
to
a
bit
of
lavender
long
pressed
in
some
black
chest
at
last
his
time
was
up
and
sam
returned
to
his
dear
village
with
its
single
street
where
in
the
sooty
forge
the
fire
still
burned
as
hammering
on
the
anvil
red
with
heat
the
smith
wrought
at
a
shoe
with
tongues
aglow
blow
upon
blow
there
stood
the
church
with
peals
for
death
and
birth
its
ancient
spire
ancient
trees
and
there
the
graves
and
mounds
of
unknown
earth
gathered
like
little
children
round
its
knees
there
was
the
bull
with
sign
above
the
door
and
sanded
floor
unrecognized
sam
took
his
glass
of
beer
and
picked
up
gossip
which
the
men
let
fall
how
farmer
clow
had
failed
and
one
named
steer
had
taken
on
the
land
repairs
and
all
and
how
the
kimber
girl
was
to
be
wed
to
betsy
ned
sam
heard
no
more
flung
down
his
pence
and
took
the
way
down
to
the
stile
there
in
the
gloaming
by
the
trysting
brook
he
came
upon
his
may
with
just
that
smile
for
ned
that
light
in
happy
eyes
oh
sugared
lies
he
came
upon
them
with
brows
and
clenched
brown
hands
and
muttered
huskily
oh
little
may
are
those
your
true
love
vows
you
swore
to
keep
while
i
was
then
crying
turned
upon
the
other
one
com
on
com
on
then
they
fell
to
with
faces
set
for
fight
and
hit
each
other
hard
with
rustic
pride
but
sam
whose
arm
with
iron
force
could
smite
knocked
his
cowed
rival
down
and
won
his
bride
may
wept
and
smiled
swayed
like
a
wild
red
rose
as
the
wind
blows
she
married
sam
who
loved
her
with
a
wild
strong
love
he
could
not
put
to
words
too
deep
for
her
to
gauge
but
with
her
child
may
dropped
off
into
the
long
sleep
and
left
him
nothing
but
the
memory
of
his
little
love
since
then
the
silent
teamster
lives
alone
the
trusted
headman
of
his
master
steer
one
only
passion
seems
he
still
to
own
the
passion
for
the
foals
he
has
to
rear
and
still
the
prettiest
full
of
life
and
play
is
little
may
highland
clear
shining
after
the
rain
the
sun
bursts
the
clouds
asunder
and
the
thunder
groans
like
a
loaded
wain
as
deep
in
the
grampians
yonder
he
grumbles
now
and
again
whenever
the
breezes
shiver
the
leaves
where
the
quiver
each
bough
and
bush
and
brier
breaks
into
living
fire
till
every
tree
is
bright
with
blossom
bursts
of
light
from
golden
roof
and
spout
brown
waters
gurgle
and
splutter
and
rush
down
the
flooded
gutter
where
the
village
children
shout
as
barefoot
they
splash
in
and
out
the
water
with
tireless
patter
the
bald
little
highland
street
is
all
alive
and
the
air
blows
keen
and
sweet
from
the
field
where
the
swallows
twitter
old
wives
on
the
doorsteps
meet
at
the
corner
the
young
maids
titter
and
the
reapers
hasten
again
ere
quite
the
daylight
wane
to
shake
out
the
barley
sheaves
while
through
the
twinkling
leaves
the
harvest
moon
upheaves
clear
shining
after
the
rain
a
forsaken
lark
lo
where
left
the
sheaves
cut
down
by
the
reaper
eating
its
way
as
it
clangs
fast
through
the
wavering
wheat
lies
the
nest
of
a
lark
whose
little
brown
eggs
could
not
keep
her
as
she
affrighted
and
scared
fled
from
the
harvester
feet
ah
what
a
heartful
of
song
that
now
will
never
awaken
closely
packed
in
the
shell
awaited
love
fostering
that
should
have
quickened
to
life
what
now
and
forsaken
never
enamoured
of
light
will
meet
the
dawn
on
the
wing
ah
what
pæans
of
joy
what
raptures
no
mortal
can
measure
sweet
as
honey
that
sealed
in
the
cells
of
the
would
have
ascended
on
high
in
jets
of
mellifluous
pleasure
would
have
dropped
from
the
clouds
to
nest
in
its
home
poor
pathetic
brown
eggs
oh
pulses
that
never
will
quicken
music
mute
in
the
shell
that
hath
been
turned
to
a
tomb
many
a
sweet
human
singer
chilled
and
withers
benumbed
in
a
world
his
joy
might
have
helped
to
illume
men
and
women
toiling
there
together
seven
i
count
in
all
in
yon
field
of
wheat
where
the
rich
ripe
ears
in
the
harvest
weather
glow
an
orange
gold
through
the
sweltering
heat
busy
life
is
still
sunk
in
brooding
leisure
birds
have
hushed
their
singing
in
the
hushed
not
a
single
cloud
mars
the
flawless
azure
not
a
shadow
moves
the
moveless
crops
in
the
glassy

that
no

is
creasing

in
the
rushes
dank
stand
like
cows
of
bronze
save
when
they
flick
the
teasing

with
switch
of

from
each
quivering
flank
nature
takes
a
rest
even
her
bees
are
sleeping
and
the
silent
wood
seems
a
church
that
shut
but
these
human
creatures
cease
not
from
their
reaping

stands

for

to

watches
his

dapples
as

wavers
in

loudly
up

roars
till
gay
troops
of
children
lightly
tripping
in
with
shouts
of
glee
see
ripe
apples
dangling
brightly
on
the
songs
of
the
songs
of
summer
are
over
and
past

forsaken
the

the

are
rudely
swung
in

like

soul
in

knocks
and
knocks
at
the
the
songs
of
summer
are
over
and
past
woe
me
for
a
music
sweeter
than
theirs
the
quick
light
bound
of
a
step
on
the
stairs
the
greeting
of
lovers
too
sweet
to
last
and
ever
the

soul
in

knocks
at

the

hollyhocks

make
a

their

bramble

dapple
far
and
wide
the

far
away
on
hilly
slopes
where
fleet
rivulets
run
miles
on
miles
of
tangled
fern
burnished
by
the
sun
glow
a
copper
dun
for
the
year
that
on
the
wane
gathering
all
its
fire
flares
up
through
the
kindling
world
as
ere
they
expire
flames
leap
high
and
higher
leaves
and
three
tall
poplars
beside
the
pool
shiver
and
moan
in
the
gusty
blast
the
carded
clouds
are
blown
like
wool
and
the
yellowing
leaves
fly
thick
and
fast
the
leaves
now
driven
before
the
blast
now
flung
by
fits
on
the
curdling
pool
are
tossed
and
dropped
at
last
as
if
at
the
whim
of
a
jabbering
fool
o
leaves
once
rustling
green
and
cool
two
met
here
where
one
moans
aghast
with
wild
heart
heaving
towards
the

three
tall
poplars
beside
the

hunter
the
hunter
moon
rides
high
high
the
plain
across
the

sky
the
herded
clouds
amain
scamper
tumultuously
chased
by
the
hounding
wind
that
yelps
behind
the
clamorous
hunt
is
done
the
kennelled
pack
one
huntsman
rides
alone
with
dangling
bridle
slack
he
wakes
a
hollow
tone
far
echoing
to
his
horn
in
clefts
forlorn
the
hunter
moon
rides
low
her
course
is
nearly
sped
where
is
the
panting
roe
where
hath
the
wild
deer
fled
hunter
and
hunted
now
lie
in
oblivion
deep
dead
or
asleep
passing
no
breath
of
wind
stirs
in
the
painted
leaves
the
meadows
are
as
stirless
as
the
sky
like
a
saint
halo
golden
vapours
lie
above
the
restful
valley
garnered
sheaves
the
journeying
sun
like
one
who
fondly
grieves
above
the
hills
seems
loitering
with
a
sigh
as
loth
to
bid
the
fruitful
earth
on
these
hushed
hours
of
luminous
autumn
eves
there
is
a
pathos
in
his
softening
glow
which
like
a
benediction
seems
to
hover
the
tranced
earth
ere
he
must
sink
below
and
leave
her
widowed
of
her
radiant
lover
a
sleeper
in
a
shroud
of
snow
while
winter
winds
howl
a
wild
dirge
above
her
robin
the
year
grown
songless
no
glad
pipings
thrill
the
elms
whose
branches
shower
their
leaves
on
the
sere
grass
where
some
late
flower
in
golden
chalice
hoards
the
sunlight
still
our
summer
guests
whose
raptures
used
to
fill
each
garth
and
honeyed
bower
have
in
adversity
inclement
hour
abandoned
us
to
bleak
november
chill
but
hearken
yonder
russet
bird
among
the
crimson
clusters
of
the
homely
thorn
still
bubbles
with
little
rills
of
song
a
blending
of
sweet
hope
and
resignation
even
so
when
life
of
love
and
youth
is
shorn
one
friend
becomes
its
last
best
consolation
red
sunsets
the
boding
sky
was
charactered
with
cloud
the
scripture
of
the
storm
but
high
in
air
where
the
unfathomed
zenith
still
was
bare
a
pure
expanse
of
violet
glowed
and
kindling
into
crimson
light
the
hurrying
wrack
with
such
a
glare
that
heaven
igniting
wildly
seemed
to
flare
on
the
dazed
eyes
of
many
an
crowd
and
in
far
lands
folk
presaged
with
blanched
lips
disastrous
wars
earthquakes
and
foundering
ships
such
whelming
floods
as
never
dykes
could
stem
or
some
proud
empire
ruin
and
eclipse
lo
such
a
sky
they
cried
as
burned
them
once
lit
the
sacking
of
jerusalem
red
sunsets
the
twilight
heavens
are
flushed
with
gathering
light
and
wet
roofs
and
huddling
streets
below
hang
with
a
strange
apocalyptic
glow
on
the
black
fringes
of
the
wintry
night
such
bursts
of
glory
may
have
rapt
the
sight
of
him
to
whom
on
patmos
long
ago
the
visionary
angel
came
to
show
that
heavenly
city
built
of
chrysolite
and
lo
three
factory
hands
begrimed
with
soot
aflame
with
the
red
splendour
marvelling
stand
and
gaze
with
lifted
faces
awed
and
mute
starved
of
earth
beauty
by
man
grudging
hand
o
toilers
robbed
of
labour
golden

ye
too
may
feast
in
nature
fairyland
the
lighthouse
at
a
stormy
light
of
sunset
glows
and
glares
between
two
banks
of
cloud
and
the
brine
thy
fair
lamp
on
the
sky
carnation
line
alone
on
the
lone
promontory
flares
friend
of
the
fisher
who
at
nightfall
fares
where
lurk
false
reefs
masked
by
the
hyaline
of
dimpling
waves
within
whose
smile
divine
death
lies
in
wait
behind
circean
snares
the
evening
knows
thee
ere
the
evening
star
or
sees
thy
flame
sole
regent
of
the
bight
when
storm
hoarse
rumoured
by
the
hills
afar
makes
mariners
steer
landward
by
thy
light
which
shows
through
shock
of
hostile
nature
war
how
man
keeps
watch
man
through
deadliest
night
on
the
riviera
in
tortuous
windings
up
the
steep
incline
the
sombre
street
toils
to
the
village
square
whose
antique
walls
in
stone
and
moulding
bear
dumb
witness
to
the
moor
afar
off
shine
with
tier
on
tier
cutting
heaven
blue
divine
the
snowy
alps
and
lower
the
hills
are
fair
with
olives
rippling
down
to
where
gold
clusters
hang
and
leaves
of
sunburnt
vine
you
may
perchance
i
never
shall
forget
when
between
twofold
glory
of
land
and
sea
we
leant
together
the
old
parapet
and
saw
the
sun
go
down
for
oh
to
me
the
beauty
of
that
beautiful
strange
place
was
its
reflection
beaming
from
your
face
winter
all
night
all
day
in
dizzy
downward
flight
fell
the
vague
chaotic
snow
till
every
landmark
of
the
earth
below
trees
moorlands
roads
and
each
familiar
sight
were
blotted
out
by
the
bewildering
white
and
winds
now
shrieking
loud
now
whimpering
low
seemed
lamentations
for
the
woe
that
death
must
swallow
life
and
darkness
light
but
all
at
once
the
rack
was
blown
away
the
snowstorm
hushing
ended
in
a
sigh
then
like
a
flame
the
crescent
moon
on
high
leaped
forth
among
the
planets
pure
as
they
earth
vied
in
whiteness
with
the
milky
way
herself
a
star
beneath
the
starry
sky
love
in
exile
whatever
way
my
days
decline
i
felt
and
feel
tho
left
alone
his
being
working
in
mine
own
the
footsteps
of
his
life
in
mine
lord
tennyson
thou
walkest
with
me
as
the
of
the
hushed
moon
high
a
snowy
hill
walks
with
the
houseless
traveller
all
the
night
when
trees
are
tongueless
and
when
mute
the
rill
moon
of
my
soul
o
phantasm
of
delight
thou
walkest
with
me
still
the
vestal
flame
of
quenchless
memory
burns
in
my
soul
sanctuary
yea
still
for
thee
my
bitter
heart
hath
yearned
as
moonward
yearns
each
separate
of
the
clamorous
sea
my
moon
of
love
to
whom
for
ever
turns
the
life
that
aches
through
me
ii
i
was
again
beside
my
love
in
dream
earth
was
so
beautiful
the
moon
was
shining
the
muffled
voice
of
many
a
cataract
stream
came
like
a
as
with
arms
entwining
our
hearts
were
mixed
in
unison
supreme
the
wind
lay
in
each
pillared
pine
the
tasselled
larches
had
no
sound
or
motion
as
my
whole
life
was
sinking
into
thine
sinking
into
a
deep
unfathomed
ocean
of
infinite
love
uncircumscribed
divine
night
held
her
breath
it
seemed
with
all
her
stars
eternal
eyes
that
watched
in
mute
compassion
our
little
lives
their
mortal
bars
fused
in
the
fulness
of
immortal
passion
a
passion
as
immortal
as
the
stars
there
was
no
longer
any
thee
or
me
no
sense
of
self
no
wish
or
incompleteness
the
moment
rounded
to
eternity
annihilated
time
destructive
fleetness
for
all
but
love
itself
had
ceased
to
be
iii
i
am
athirst
but
not
for
wine
the
drink
i
long
for
is
divine
poured
only
from
your
eyes
in
mine
i
hunger
but
the
bread
i
want
of
which
my
blood
and
brain
are
scant
is
your
sweet
speech
for
which
i
pant
i
am
and
lagging
lame
life
creeps
along
my
languid
frame
your
love
would
fan
it
into
flame
heaven
in
that
little
word
your
love
it
makes
my
heart
coo
like
a
dove
my
tears
fall
as
i
think
thereof
iv
i
would
i
were
the
thou
the
flower
that
i
might
fill
thy
cup
with
glimmering
light
i
would
i
were
the
bird
and
thou
the
bower
to
sing
thee
songs
throughout
the
summer
night
i
would
i
were
a
pine
tree
deeply
rooted
and
thou
the
lofty
rock
still
while
the
blasts
of
heaven
around
us
hooted
to
cleave
to
thee
and
weather
every
shock
i
would
i
were
the
rill
and
thou
the
river
so
might
i
leaping
from
some
headlong
steep
with
all
my
waters
lost
in
thine
for
ever
be
hurried
onwards
to
the
unfathomed
deep
i
would
what
would
i
not
o
foolish
dreaming
my
words
are
but
as
leaves
by
autumn
shed
that
in
the
faded
moonlight
idly
gleaming
drop
on
the
grave
where
all
our
love
lies
dead
dost
thou
remember
ever
for
my
sake
when
we
two
rowed
upon
the
lake
how
the
waters
blew
their
spray
about
our
brows
like
of
may
one
memorable
day
dost
thou
remember
the
glad
mouth
that
cried
were
it
not
sweet
to
die
now
side
by
side
to
lie
together
tangled
in
the
deep
close
as
the
to
the
heart
so
keep
the
everlasting
sleep
dost
thou
remember
ah
such
death
as
this
had
set
the
seal
upon
my
heart
young
bliss
but
wrenched
asunder
severed
and
apart
life
knew
a
deadlier
death
the
blighting
smart
which
only
kills
the
heart
vi
o
moon
large
golden
summer
moon
hanging
between
the
linden
trees
which
in
the
intermittent
breeze
beat
with
the
rhythmic
pulse
of
june
o
scented
through
and
through
with
flower
of
lime
sweet
now
as
in
that
other
time
when
all
my
heart
was
sweet
as
you
the
sorcery
of
this
breathing
bloom
works
like
enchantment
in
my
brain
till
shuddering
back
to
life
again
my
dead
self
rises
from
its
tomb
and
lovely
with
the
love
of
yore
its
white
ghost
haunts
the
ways
but
when
it
meets
me
face
to
face
flies
trembling
to
the
grave
once
more
vii
why
will
you
haunt
me
unawares
and
walk
into
my
sleep
pacing
its
shadowy
thoroughfares
where
perfume
scents
the
airs
while
ghosts
of
sorrow
creep
where
on
hope
ruined
with
ineffectual
beams
the
moon
of
memory
coldly
glares
upon
the
land
of
dreams
my
yearning
eyes
were
fain
to
look
upon
your
hidden
face
their
love
alas
you
could
not
brook
but
in
your
own
you
mutely
took
my
hand
and
for
a
space
you
wrung
it
till
i
throbbed
and
shook
and
woke
with
wildest
moan
and
wet
face
channelled
like
a
brook
with
your
tears
or
my
own
viii
when
you
wake
from
troubled
slumbers
with
a
brain
and
old
leaves
which
no
man
numbers
chattering
tap
against
the
pane
and
the
midnight
wind
is
wailing
till
your
very
life
seems
quailing
as
the
long
gusts
shudder
and
sigh
know
you
not
that
homeless
cry
is
my
love
which
can
not
die
wailing
through
eternity
when
beside
the
glowing
embers
sitting
in
the
twilight
lone
drop
on
drop
you
hear
melancholy
monotone
as
the
heavy
rain
comes
sweeping
with
a
sound
of
weeping
weeping
till
your
blood
is
chilled
with
fears
know
you
not
those
falling
tears
flowing
fast
through
years
on
years
for
my
sobs
within
your
ears
when
with
dolorous
moan
the
billows
surge
around
where
far
and
wide
leagues
on
leagues
of
hollows
throb
with
thunders
of
the
tide
and
the
weary
waves
in
breaking
fill
you
thrill
you
as
with
aching
memories
of
our
love
of
yore
where
you
pace
the
sounding
shore
hear
you
not
through
roll
and
roar
soul
call
soul
for
evermore
ix
in
a
lonesome
crouched
a
mourner
white
of
face
wild
her
eyes
unheeding
circling
pomp
of
night
and
day
ever
crying
well
away
love
lies
and
her
sighs
were
like
a
knell
and
her
tears
for
ever
fell
with
their
warm
rain
feeding
that
purpureal
flower
alas
trailing
prostrate
in
the
grass
love
lies
through
the
yews
gloom
crimson
light
dripped
on
the
tomb
funeral
shadows
breeding
in
the
sky
the
sun
light
shed
dyed
the
earth
one
awful
red
love
lies
came
grey
mists
and
blanching
cloud
bore
one
universal
shroud
came
the
bowed
moon
leading
from
the
infinite
afar
star
that
rumoured
unto
star
love
lies
x
on
life
long
round
by
chance
i
found
a
dell
impearled
with
dew
where
hyacinths
gushing
from
the
ground
lent
to
the
earth
heaven
native
hue
of
holy
blue
i
sought
that
plot
of
azure
light
once
more
in
gloomy
hours
but
snow
had
fallen
overnight
and
wrapped
in
mortuary
white
my
fairy
ring
of
flowers
xi
ah
yesterday
was
dark
and
drear
my
heart
was
deadly
sore
without
thy
love
it
seemed
my
dear
that
i
could
live
no
more
and
yet
i
laugh
and
sing
care
or
care
not
for
me
thou
canst
not
take
the
love
away
with
which
i
worship
thee
and
if
dear
i
live
my
heart
i
shall
not
break
for
still
i
hold
it
that
to
give
is
sweeter
than
to
take
xii
yea
the
roses
are
still
on
fire
with
the
bygone
heat
of
july
though
the
least
little
wind
drifting
by
shake
a
or
two
from
the
brier
be
it
never
so
soft
a
sigh
ember
of
love
still
glows
and
lingers
deep
at
the
red
heart
smouldering
core
with
the
sudden
passionate
throb
of
yore
we
shook
as
our
eyes
and
clinging
fingers
met
once
only
to
meet
no
more
xiii
we
met
as
strangers
on
life
lonely
way
and
yet
it
seemed
we
knew
each
other
well
there
was
no
end
to
what
thou
hadst
to
say
or
to
the
thousand
things
i
found
to
tell
my
heart
long
silent
at
thy
voice
that
day
chimed
in
my
breast
like
to
a
silver
bell
how
much
we
spoke
and
yet
still
left
untold
some
secret
half
revealed
within
our
eyes
didst
thou
not
love
me
once
in
ages
old
had
i
not
called
thee
with
importunate
cries
and
like
a
child
left
sobbing
in
the
cold
listened
to
catch
from
far
thy
fond
replies
we
met
as
strangers
and
as
such
we
part
yet
all
my
life
seems
leaving
me
with
thine
ah
to
be
clasped
once
only
heart
to
heart
if
only
once
to
feel
that
thou
wert
mine
these
lips
are
locked
and
yet
i
know
thou
art
that
all
in
all
for
which
my
soul
did
pine
xiv
you
make
the
sunshine
of
my
heart
and
its
tempestuous
shower
sometimes
the
thought
of
you
is
like
a
lilac
bush
in
flower
yea
as
hives
in
may
and
then
the
pang
of
it
will
strike
my
bosom
with
a
fiery
smart
as
though
love
deeply
planted
dart
drained
all
its
life
away
my
thoughts
hum
round
you
dear
like
bees
about
a
bank
of
thyme
or
round
the
yellow
blossoms
of
the
lime
ah
sweeter
you
than
honeydew
yet
dark
the
ways
of
love
for
it
has
robbed
my
soul
of
peace
and
marred
my
life
and
turned
into
funereal
rue
xv
dear
when
i
look
into
your
eyes
my
hurts
are
healed
my
heart
grows
whole
the
barren
places
in
my
soul
like
waste
lands
under
april
skies
break
into
flower
beneath
your
eyes
ah
life
grows
lovely
where
you
are
only
to
think
of
you
gives
light
to
my
dark
heart
within
whose
night
your
image
though
you
bide
afar
glows
like
a
star
dare
i
crave
more
than
only
this
a
thrill
of
love
a
transient
smile
to
gladden
all
my
world
awhile
no
more
alas
is
mortal
bliss
not
transient
as
a
lover
kiss
xvi
ah
if
you
knew
how
soon
and
late
my
eyes
long
for
a
sight
of
you
sometimes
in
passing
by
my
gate
you
linger
until
fall
of
dew
if
you
but
knew
ah
if
you
knew
how
sick
and
sore
my
life
flags
for
the
want
of
you
straightway
you
enter
at
the
door
and
clasp
my
hand
between
your
two
if
you
but
knew
ah
if
you
knew
how
lost
and
lone
i
watch
and
weep
and
wait
for
you
you
press
my
heart
close
to
your
own
till
love
had
healed
me
through
and
through
if
you
but
knew
xvii
your
looks
have
touched
my
soul
with
bright
ineffable
emotion
as
moonbeams
on
a
stormy
night
illume
with
transitory
light
a
seagull
on
her
lonely
flight
across
the
lonely
ocean
fluttering
from
out
the
gloom
and
roar
on
fitful
wing
she
flies
above
the
shore
then
drowned
in
darkness
as
before
she
lost
as
i
when
lit
no
more
by
your
beloved
eyes
xviii
oh
brown
eyes
with
long
black
lashes
young
brown
eyes
depths
of
night
from
which
there
flashes
lightning
as
of
summer
skies
beautiful
brown
eyes
in
your
veiled
mysterious
splendour
passion
lies
sleeping
but
with
sudden
tender
dreams
that
fill
with
vague
surmise
beautiful
brown
eyes
all
my
soul
with
yearning
shaken
asks
in
sighs
who
will
see
your
heart
awaken
love
divine
sunrise
in
those
young
brown
eyes
xix
once
on
a
golden
day
in
the
golden
month
of
may
i
gave
my
heart
away
little
birds
were
singing
i
culled
my
heart
in
truth
wet
with
the
dews
of
youth
for
love
to
take
forsooth
little
flowers
were
springing
love
sweetly
laughed
at
this
and
between
kiss
and
kiss
fled
with
my
heart
in
his
winds
warmly
blowing
and
with
his
sun
and
shower
love
kept
my
heart
in
flower
as
in
the
greenest
bower
rose
richly
glowing
till
worn
at
evensong
love
dropped
my
heart
among
stones
by
the
way
ere
long
misprizèd
token
there
in
the
wind
and
rain
trampled
and
rent
in
twain
to
be
whole
again
my
heart
lies
broken
xx
what
magic
is
there
in
thy
mien
what
sorcery
in
thy
smile
which
charms
away
all
cark
and
care
which
turns
the
foul
days
into
fair
and
for
a
little
while
changes
this
disenchanted
scene
from
the
sere
leaf
into
the
green
transmuting
with
love
golden
wand
this
beggared
life
to
fairyland
my
heart
goes
forth
to
thee
oh
friend
as
some
poor
pilgrim
to
a
shrine
a
pilgrim
who
has
come
from
far
to
seek
his
spirit
folding
star
and
sees
the
taper
shine
the
goal
to
which
his
wanderings
tend
where
want
and
weariness
shall
end
and
kneels
ecstatically
blest
because
his
heart
hath
entered
rest
as
opiates
to
the
sick
on
wakeful
nights
as
light
to
flowers
as
flowers
in
poor
men
rooms
as
to
the
fisher
when
the
tempest
glooms
the
cheerful
twinkling
of
his
village
lights
as
emerald
isles
to
flagging
swallow
flights
as
roses
garlanding
with
tendrilled
blooms
the
unweeded
hillocks
of
forgotten
tombs
as
singing
birds
on
heights
thou
art
to
me
a
comfort
past
compare
for
thy
presence
sweet
as
may
sets
all
my
nerves
to
music
makes
away
with
sorrow
and
the
numbing
frost
of
care
until
the
influence
of
thine
eyes
bright
sway
has
made
life
glass
go
up
from
foul
to
fair
peace
throbbing
heart
nor
let
us
shed
one
tear
this
late
love
unseasonable
glow
sweet
as
a
violet
blooming
in
the
snow
the
posthumous
offspring
of
the
widowed
year
that
smells
of
march
when
all
the
world
is
sere
and
while
around
the
hurtling
blow
which
twist
the
oak
and
lay
the
pine
tree
low
stands
childlike
in
the
storm
and
has
no
fear
poor
helpless
blossom
orphaned

how
could
it

brave

oh
love
more

so
late

the
of

the

ask

that

sunk

yet
left
to

his
glory

i
ask
if

may
not
touch
grief
with
his
memorial
ray

to
loss
itself

than
the

of
the
irish

it

having

columba
and

for

an
attempt
at
filling
up
this
gap
has
recently
been
made
by
miss
blind
in
a
narrative
poem
devoted
to
the
fate
of
oran
the
friend
and
disciple
of
columba
apart
from
the
sonorous
beauty
of
her
lines
there
is
in
her
diction
a
straightforwardness
and
simplicity
and
an
entire
absence
of
affectation
and
false
sentiment
which
combined
with
considerable
power
of
characterization
make
her
volume
a
remarkable
contribution
to
english
literature
september
to
disturb
the
of
a
legend
is
always
a
bold
and
mostly
a
rash
proceeding
and
yet
so
skilfully
is
the
story
handled
that
the
main
incidents
of
the
legend
do
not
lose
but
gain
by
this
disturbance
of
the
and
the
character
of
oran
which
with
the
old
could
only
have
presented
the
single
side
of
the
religious
enthusiast
becomes
a
character
exhibiting
that
complexity
which
modern
taste
demands
directness
of
style
and
lucidity
of
narrative
are
the
characteristic
excellences
of
the
poem
there
are
few
contemporary
poets
who
could
have
done
so
much
dramatic
business
in
so
few
lines
in
each
of
the
sonnets
there
is
a
thought
that
is
well
expressed
and
worth
expressing
july
it
is
in
the
domain
of
character
that
the
poem
is
distinguished
by
its
highest
excellence
there
is
an
ideal
statuesqueness
embodied
in
the
person
of
columba
such
as
is
felt
to
possess
a
powerful
appeal
to
the
imagination
the
poem
embraces
many
passions
of
which
the
most
tender
and
beautiful
finds
expression
in
the
exquisite
creation
of
the
radiant
girl
for
whose
love
oran
breaks
his
vow
of
chastity
but
the
really
powerful
contribution
to
our
knowledge
of
character
which
this
book
contains
is
fittingly
centred
in
oran
himself
a
dramatic
instinct
of
high
order
finds
utterance
in
his
struggles
between
opposing
passions
nor
are
the
metrical
excellences
of
the
poem
less
conspicuous
if
one
were
in
need
of
some
single
phrase
by
which
to
denote
the
ultimate
effect
produced
by
this
book
one
might
say
that
it
seems
the
most
of
all
recent
first
efforts
even
of
established
rank
july
in
the
choice
of
a
subject
for
her
chief
poem
she
has
been
singularly
fortunate
that
a
story
such
as
this
is
full
of
poetical
suggestiveness
is
obvious
and
miss
blind
has
proved
herself
equal
to
the
occasion
she
has
avoided
writing
anything
approaching
to
a
poem
she
metes
out
justice
with
an
equal
hand
to
all
her
characters
the
genuine
enthusiasm
and
religious
zeal
of
the
monks
are
set
forth
in
language
as
inspired
as
is
the
final
protest
of
oran
against
their
narrow
fanaticism
and
one
of
the
best
passages
in
the
book
is
indeed
the
sermon
in
which
columba
announces
the
gospel
of
love
and
redemption
to
the
islanders
mall
august
prophecy
of
saint
oran
is
skilfully
told
and
vigorously
written
in
the
description
of
nature
and
scenery
in
the
delineation
of
character
and
in
the
management
of
singularly
difficult
positions
there
is
visible
a
firm
and
practised
hand
a
bold
and
unmistakable
power
street
children
dance
not
unworthily
ranks
with
some
of
the
touching
pieces
of
hood
barrett
browning
and
others
september
the
only
excuse
for
street
music
that
can
reasonably
be
considered
valid
is
the
touching
plea
for
public
toleration
which
is
embodied
in
miss
mathilde
blind
poem
wherein
the
spectacle
of
poor
children
dancing
round
an
organ
is
as
pathetically
moralized
and
as
tender
and
full
of
loving
pity
as
browning
of
the
children
september
the
poem
is
rich
in
true
description
of
sea
and
sky
and
mountain
and
glows
in
sympathy
with
the
deeper
feelings
which
stir
humanity
there
has
been
published
no
poem
of
such
creative
suggestiveness
as
this
for
many
a
day
and
we
hope
and
believe
that
it
is
the
precursor
of
other
work
by
the
same
unfaltering
hand
this
poem
is
a
true
work
of
art
complete

beautiful

is
in

the
heather
on
fire
a
tale
of
the
highland
clearances
miss
blind
has
produced
one
of
the
most
noticeable
and
moving
poems
which
recent
years
have
added
to
our
shelves
as
a
singer
with
a
message
her
attempt
is
praiseworthy
and
her
performance
is
fairly
it
is
eminently
homogeneous
the
passion
once
felt
the
inspiration
once
obeyed
the
pours
forth
its
stream
in
a
strong
and
uniform
current
which
knows
no
pause
until
its
impulse
ceases
the
story
is
pathetic
at
once
in
its
simplicity
and
in
its
terror
we
congratulate
the
author
upon
her
boldness
in
choosing
a
subject
of
our
own
time
fertile
in
what
is
pathetic
and
free
from
any
taint
of
the
vulgar
and
conventional
poetry
of
late
years
has
tended
too
much
towards
motives
of
a
merely
fanciful
and
abstruse
sometimes
a
plainly
artificial
character
and
we
have
had
much
of
lyrical
energy
or
attraction
with
little
of
the
real
marrow
of
human
life
the
flesh
and
blood
of
man
and
woman
positive
the
emotion
which
inheres
in
actual
life
the
very
smile
and
the
very
tear
and
are
after
all
precious
to
poetry
and
we
have
them
here
heather
on
fire
may
possibly
prove
to
be
something
of
a
new
departure
and
one
that
was
certainly
not
superfluous
july
miss
blind
has
chosen
for
her
new
poem
one
of
those
terrible
highland
clearances
which
stain
the
history
of
scotch
landlordism
though
her
tale
is
a
fiction
it
is
too
well
founded
on
fact
it
may
be
said
generally
of
the
poem
that
the
most
difficult
scenes
are
those
in
which
miss
blind
succeeds
best
and
on
the
whole
we
are
inclined
to
think
that
its
greatest
and
most
surprising
success
is
the
picture
of
the
poor
old
soldier
rory
driven
mad
by
the
burning
of
his
wife
in
his
frenzy
he
mixes
up
his
old
battles
with
the
french
and
the
descent
of
the
landlord
ejectors
upon
the
village
august
in
this
versified
tale
of
highland
clearances
mathilde
blind
has
with
genuine
poetic
instinct
selected
a
family
the
fortunes
of
which
form
the
burden
of
her
story
literature
and
poetry
are
never
seen
at
their
best
save
in
contact
with
actual
life
this
little
book
abounds
in
vivid
delineation
of
character
and
is
redolent
with
the
noblest
human
sympathy
daily
june
a
subject
which
has
painfully
preoccupied
public
opinion
is
in
the
poem
entitled
heather
on
fire
treated
with
characteristic
power
by
miss
mathilde
blind
irish
evictions
have
offered
so
convenient
a
theme
to
party
strife
that
the
sufferings
of
the
unhappy
highland
crofters
have
not
always
met
with
the
compassion
they
were
so
well
calculated
to
inspire
in
eloquent
and
forcible
verse
miss
blind
tells
the
tale
of
their
wrongs
their
resistance
to
the
hard
fate
imposed
upon
them
and
describes
the
bitter
grief
with
which
on
the
decks
with
hungry
eyes
straining
towards
the
coast
that
flies
and
flies
those
among
them
driven
into
exile
look
on
the
shores
to
which
many
bid
an
eternal
farewell
both
as
a
narrative
and
descriptive
poem
heather
on
fire
is
equally
remarkable
july
we
are
happy
in
being
able
to
extend
to
the
present
poem
a
welcome
equally
sincere
and
equally
hearty
for
it
is
a
poem
that
is
rich
not
only
in
power
and
beauty
but
in
that
of
humanity
which
stirs
and
moves
us
and
of
which
so
much
contemporary
verse
is
almost
painfully
deficient
miss
blind
does
not
possess
her
theme
she
is
possessed
by
it
as
was
browning
when
she
wrote
we
can
best
describe
the
kind
of
her
success
by
noting
the
fact
that
while
engaged
in
the
perusal
of
her
book
we
do
not
say
a
fine
poem
but
a
terrible
story
or
more
probably
still
say
nothing
at
all
but
read
on
and
on
under
the
spell
of
a
great
horror
and
an
pity
poetry
of
which
this
can
be
said
needs
no
other
recommendation
and
therefore
we
need
not
unduly
lengthen
our
review
of
heather
on
fire
examiner
and
september
there
are
charming
pictures
of
west
highland
scenery
in
arran
apparently
and
of
the
surroundings
and
conditions
of
highland
cottar
life
july
in
heather
on
fire
she
exhibits
a
clearness
and
beauty
of
diction
a
rhythmical
correctness
a
grace
and
simplicity
of
style
which
mark
her
out
as
no
slavish
follower
of
any
poetic
but
an
unaffected
and
truthful
expression
of
her
own
feelings
whatever
the
reader
opinion
may
be
on
the
grievance
which
miss
blind
throws
into
such
fierce
light
he
can
not
fail
to
be
pleased
with
her
graceful
tale
so
gracefully
and
simply
told
july
miss
mathilde
blind
poem
is
the
tragic
epic
of
the
old
evictions
in
the
highlands
of
scotland
it
is
a
strange
fact
that
the
general
reader
knows
more
about
the
siege
of
troy
the
norman
conquest
and
the
wars
of
the
roses
than
about
such
matters
in
the
very
history
of
our
own
days
as
the
depopulation
of
the
highlands
of
scotland
by
the
landlords
the
old
story
comes
to
the
front
just
now
by
reason
of
the
crofter
agitation
in
the
preface
to
her
fine
and
touching
epic
and
in
the
notes
at
the
end
miss
blind
passes
in
review
some
of
the
facts
of
the
eviction
of
the
glen
sannox
people
by
the
duke
of
hamilton
in
where
as
she
says
progress
of
civilization
which
has
redeemed
many
a
wilderness
and
gladdened
the
solitary
places
of
the
world
has
come
with
a
curse
to
these
highland
glens
and
turned
green
pastures
and
golden
harvest
fields
once
more
into
a
desert
the
on
fire
is
a
poem
in
four
cantos
or
comprising
about
two
hundred
stanzas
board
july
it
is
written
in
a
strain
which
must
of
necessity
appeal
to
the
sympathies
of
all
grades
of
society
and
at
the
same
time
it
is
eminently
poetical
both
in
thought
and
rhythm
august
a
book
like
this
forms
an
admirable
corrective
to
the
harsh
and
theories
of
such
landlords
as
the
duke
of
argyle
on
the
rights
of
his
class
independent
august
there
is
a
sonorous
beauty
a
classic
dignity
and
depth
of
pathos
throughout
her
four
cantos
and
a
vivid
and
thrilling
description
is
given
of
the
industrious
hamlets
the
contented
happy
people
and
the
ruthless
manner
in
which
the
evictions
were
effected
by
the
stewards
and
august
tarantella
a
romance
the
author
of
this
romance
is
favourably
known
by
other
works
and
by
her
appreciative
of
george
eliot
the
strange
effects
of
the
bite
of
a
tarantula
spider
so
firmly
believed
in
by
the
italian
peasantry
and
the
marvellous
power
of
musical
enthusiasm
supply
the
motive
of
the
story
and
the
characters
are
portrayed
with
great
force
pathos
and
a
touch
of
homely
humour
christmas
miss
blind
may
be
congratulated
on
her
first
novel
in
the
as
we
have
called
it
of
the
musician
emanuel
sturm
nearly
all
the
interest
of
the
book
is
concentrated
the
violinist
poor
and
unknown
finds
himself
at
capri
accident
brings
him
one
evening
to
a
frightened
group
of
women
one
of
whom
has
just
been
bitten
by
the
tarantula
and
according
to
the
popular
superstition
he
is
implored
to
play
in
order
to
drive
the
poison
out
of
her
he
refuses
at
first
but
afterwards
consents
and
finding
himself
almost
supernaturally
inspired
plays
an
improvised
throughout
a
whole
stormy
night
finally
curing
the
girl
the
tune
thus
strangely
hit
on
spreads
and
ultimately
makes
him
famous
but
the
love
he
has
conceived
for
his
antonella
brings
him
almost
as
much
misery
as
his
music
brings
him
fame
mall
february
admiration
of
the
delicate
sketching
now
in
vogue
should
not
blind
us
to
the
very
opposite
kind
of
charm
of
which
is
full
entirely
poetical
in
conception
save
that
it
is
not
written
in
metre
is
more
essentially
a
poem
than
many
a
narrative
written
in
smooth
and
elegant
verse
is
indeed
full
of
strange
originality
and
scenic
effects
of
uncommon
powers
the
dance
among
the
ruins
is
not
likely
to
be
soon
forgotten
by
the
most
unimaginative
of
readers
and
it
is
rarely
we
think
that
in
an
english
novel
the
psychology
of
the
poetic
temperament
has
been
touched
by
a
hand
so
delicate
and
at
the
same
time
so
strong
january
there
is
abundant
imagination
and
the
language
is
generally
fresh
and
vigorous
the
author
finds
many
opportunities
of
introducing
scenes
from
german
life
which
are
evidently
written
with
intimate
knowledge
this
is
distinctly
a
novel
to
read
june
this
powerful
and
pathetic
tale
has
carried
us
more
completely
out
of
ourselves
and
along
with
it
than
any
work
of
fiction
we
have
read
for
many
a
day
her
miss
blind
glow
with
rich
local
colours
she
is
a
complete
mistress
of
the
art
of
dramatic
cause
and
effect
when
once
fairly
under
weigh
she
never
allows
the
interest
to
flag
for
a
single
moment
thus
it
is
only
when
we
have
laid
down
the
final
volume
that
we
have
time
or
inclination
to
pause
and
recognize
the
care
and
art
which
have
contributed
to
this
triumphant
result
to
turn
back
and
dwell
on
the
extraordinary
knowledge
of
the
human
heart
extraordinary
alike
for
its
depth
and
its
range
as
for
the
wit
and
humour
with
which
the
book
is
freely
sprinkled
the
poetic
and
artistic
spirit
which
pervades
it
throughout
they
can
only
be
appreciated
on
a
second
or
a
third
perusal
december
is
extremely
clever
and
the
treatment
of
the
weird
subject
she
has
chosen
picturesque
in
the
extreme
the
local
colouring
is
especially
fine
and
her
character
studies
extremely
strong
thrice
welcome
in
its
form
is
a
book
bound
to
make
its
mark
december
we
have
very
ingenious
resources
in
music
and
the
bite
of
the
tarantula
which
alone
music
is
said
to
heal
notwithstanding
the
sense
of
improbability
we
follow
the
strange
fortunes
of
antonella
countess
ogotshka
and
her
almost
magical
transformation
with
interest
mina
the
innocent
girl
her
friend
is
well
delineated
and
emanuel
sturm
the
wonderful
violinist
and
composer
for
whose
portrait
paganini
has
doubtless
been
available
is
original
no
less
than
his
friend
the
painter
january
is
a
very
clever
story
with
plenty
of
action
and
not
without
tragic
incidents
the
author
has
also
plenty
of
humour
and
there
is
at
least
as
much
light
as
shade
in
the
book
mina
is
not
less
delightful
than
the
countess
is
objectionable
in
spite
of
her
beauty
and
her
daring
november
we
shall
not
spoil
the
story
by
hinting
at
its
it
is
a
deeply
interesting
one
and
the
characters
three
of
them
at
least
are
sufficiently
original
to
give
the
author
a
high
rank
as
a
novelist
the
book
abounds
in
striking
and
interesting
pictures
of
italian
and
german
life
and
scenery
november
is
indeed
a
novel
unlike
the
common
full
of
power
and
imagination
and
originality
it
would
be
unjust
to
deny
to
this
very
remarkable
book
a
large
share
of
what
the
world
calls
genius
march
by
her
recent
works
prophecy
of
saint
oran
and
the
of
george
eliot
miss
blind
brought
herself
before
the
public
as
a
writer
of
considerable
ability
and
her
latest
novel
will
do
much
to
increase
her
reputation
deserves
to
be
classed
among
the
best
novels
of
the
present
day
june
there
is
an
inherent
charm
about
which
will
be
apparent
to
the
reader
from
a
perusal
of
the
first
chapter
this
agreeable
quality
does
not
end
there
however
the
whole
of
the
tale
which
is
divided
into
chapters
is
permeated
with
features
of
an
exceptionally
attractive
description
not
the
least
noteworthy
character
of
the
story
is
its
novelty
most
of
the
incidents
which
are
carefully
elaborated
and
follow
in
logical
sequence
are
conspicuous
for
an
airy
freshness
in
nature
and
treatment
every
chapter
has
its
specific
purpose
there
being
a
uniform
overflow
of
idea
and
sentiment
and
each
development
of
the
pleasing
romance
opens
to
the
mental
vision
of
the
thoughtful
reader
incidents
of

engrossing
description
continental
scenes
and
customs
are
described
with
freeness
and
perspicuity
and
the
varied
and
eventful
adventures
of
