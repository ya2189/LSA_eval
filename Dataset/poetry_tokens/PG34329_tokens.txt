this

it

i
run
with
the

better
to
be
proud

than
to

with

better
than
the
smell
of
warm

after
a

bitter
and
bright
the
scent
of
hidden
fern
though
the
heart
fail
in
the
panting
side
and
the
eye
be
clouded
with
straining
after
the
deep
copse
still
is
there
thrill
in
flight
soft
are
oak
leaves
under
the
swift
feet
sweet
are
the
distant
notes
of
the
hunter
horn
and
the
hounds
baying
sweet
to
the
trembling
ears
of
the
hidden
and
hunted
i
run
with
the
fox
memory
sharp
it
has
come
to
this
my
darling
with
the
years
gone
over
with
the
truth
acknowledged
you
are
not
coming
back
it
is
entering
a
room
where
the
curtains
are
drawn
where
dust
lies
heavy
on
the
table
top
sudden
your
name
scrawled
in
the
gloom
and
the
mouth
gone
dry
and
the
heart
stopped
gift
shop
window
apple
annie
ancient
and
her
amazing
garments
huddled
about
her
bent
almost
double
to
peer
in
the
window
she
stood
on
the
one
foot
and
then
on
the
other
and
nodded
her
head
like
a
great
dark
crow
her
old
lips
moved
in
some
but
what
she
said
was
her
own
dark
secret
the
winked
in
their
pewter
holders
a
bewildering
array
of
costume
jewellery
of
filigreed
ivory
and
cornflower
crystal
was
spread
like
the
spoils
of
a
pirate
frigate
for
apple
annie
remote
appraisal
some
place
far
back
in
the
mind
recess
the
hunger
for
beauty
stirred
in
sleep
a
little
smile
like
a
secret
fragment
of
and
lost
delight
moved
like
the
stir
of
a
small
frail
fan
on
a
face
that
was
wrinkled
and
dim
with
age
with
a
hesitant
gesture
desire
engendered
her
old
hands
fluttered
against
the
pane
twisted
and
gnarled
and
pitifully
empty
fluttered
and
moved
and
were
still
again
sire
my
mother
was
a
lady
with
hair
like
silk
and
eyes
like
gentians
and
a
skin
like
milk
but
my
father
loved
laughter
and
the
flowing
bowl
and
his
eyes
were
dark
mischief
rest
his
soul
my
mother
often
stopped
me
from
having
fun
with
the
echo
of
her
proper
it
is
done
but
i
feel
my
father
hand
as
he
rough
my
hair
saying
black
and
rebellious
we
a
bold
bad
pair
and
now
i
woman
grown
with
a
son
ah
me
who
am
i
to
tell
him
what
the
score
should
be
communion
the
rain
falls
down
silverly
on
the
dark
night
oh
but
the
air
is
soft
to
touch
and
your
face
white
this
is
for
remembering
for
putting
away
in
the
mind
pocket
like
a
shell
or
a
treasured
stone
found
at
the
beach
this
touch
this
kiss
this
heart
turning
toward
heart
this
is
for
remembering
when
you
are
beyond
reach
words
at
best
are
like
thistledown
let
us
be
quiet
then
give
me
your
hand
you
are
my
friend
and
my
love
till
the
world
ends
you
understand
loud
silence
this
is
loud
silence
this
bewildering
space
untenanted
by
you
it
has
the
ugly
face
of
loneliness
hush
foolish
heart
you
have
been
here
before
this
is
your
blood
that
rusts
upon
the
door
he
will
not
go
unremembered
for
sir
charles
roberts
into
fire
and
air
and
finally
soft
and
subtle
ash
this
clay
in
which
bright
beauty
burned
became
articulate
and
lived
a
little
while
he
will
not
go
unremembered
small
boys
on
floor
will
pad
with
him
down
wooded
ways
where
creatures
of
the
forest
are
realer
than
the
room
and
its
four
quite
solid
walls
young
girls
will
pore
with
shining
eyes
over
verse
that
sings
of
life
and
beauty
he
will
not
go
unremembered
who
served
his
muse
with
faithful
plying
pen
this
his
bright
spark
of
lovely
immortality
struck
from
the
cycle
of
his
life
and
work
he
will
not
go
unremembered
bagpipes
skirl
in
heaven
ah
not
irreverent
this
for
i
am
very
sure
the
bagpipes
skirl
in
heaven
you
see
not
be
heaven
for
him
without
his
native
music
dear
to
his
heart
called
up
at
will
shrill
and
sweet
defiant
as
all
get
out
remembered
past
death
and
angels
yes
even
angels
must
smile
to
see
him
marching
by
brave
in
his
kilt
his
head
thrown
back
his
plaidie
streaming
in
the
wind
who
could
be
sad
for
one
so
young
and
fair
immortal
as
a
god
who
gave
his
life
with
never
a
backward
glance
not
irreverent
this
when
bagpipes
skirl
in
heaven
do
when
we
were
very
small
children
in
kindergarten
we
used
to
play
a
game
it
was
called
do
my
partner
and
you
bowed
each
to
the
other
and
clasped
hands
and
solemnly
went
round
in
a
circle
which
ended
with
a
triumphant
rollicking
skip
it
the
strangest
thing
looking
back
from
so
many
years
i
can
still
remember
distinctly
that
the
only
little
boy
i
skip
with
had
eyes
exactly
like
yours
i
can
remember
stamping
my
foot
and
being
unspeakably
difficult
when
the
teacher
tried
to
persuade
me
that
another
little
boy
would
do
that
one
of
the
most
important
features
of
that
particular
game
another
little
boy
wo
do
big
bay
this
is
fall
so
i
moust
remember
big
bay
and
the
nets
drying
on
the
dock
and
the
birches
stripped
for
winter
and
wine
in
the
sun
there
were
scarlet
berries
maybe
they
were
bittersweet
and
all
the
ferns
were
some
places
you
long
for
with
a
physical
longing
it
is
like
that
with
big
bay
now
in
october
prayer
in
a
hospital
dear
god
let
him
play
games
for
a
little
while
yet
let
his
hands
curve
to
a
hockey
stick
and
the
thrust
of
a
canoe
paddle
let
him
dive
like
a
young
arrow
into
clean
water
but
dear
god
let
him
play
games
i
have
been
to
a
military
hospital
i
have
talked
to
mike
mike
is
much
older
his
two
boots
hang
at
the
foot
of
his
bed
two
carefully
dubbined
boots
but
mike
does
need
two
boots
he
just
had
a
leg
taken
off
he
was
cut
down
at
dieppe
he
was
fourteen
months
in
prison
camp
in
germany
o
yes
they
looked
after
us
good
enough
but
they
had
to
tend
their
own
wounded
first
and
there
were
so
damn
many
of
us
i
talked
to
john
after
i
got
over
the
first
shock
john
has
both
arms
off
well
above
the
elbow
they
call
him
arms
in
the
hospital
ward
it
sort
of
a
grim
institutional
joke
john
has
an
eye
out
too
the
new
glass
one
does
match
his
own
eye
are
you
married
or
single
john
i
managed
single
he
said
oh
yes
single
he
said
it
thankfully
like
a
sigh
like
the
sigh
a
child
gives
who
has
cried
himself
to
sleep
a
hand
grenade
exploded
in
john
two
hands
it
was
the
last
thing
he
ever
hold
in
his
two
hands
and
then
there
was
fred
fred
got
his
at
sicily
he
been
training
for
three
and
one
half
years
and
he
was
in
on
the
big
push
three
weeks
sure
it
was
shrapnel
took
an
eye
out
and
gave
him
a
bum
leg
he
had
a
picture
of
his
english
bride
coming
out
to
canada
by
god
next
month
if
they
let
her
pretty
guy
was
i
in
the
wedding
picture
you
doggone
right
but
it
made
a
fellow
so
damn
mad
three
and
one
half
years
training
to
get
into
it
for
three
weeks
and
then
hospitals
one
after
the
other
for
it
made
a
guy
so
damn
mad
mac
has
any
arms
now
either
how
did
he
blow
his
nose
well
he
could
laugh
at
that
feeble
crack
and
even
give
it
serious
consideration
by
gosh
i
do
think
i
had
a
cold
since
i
got
off
in
italy
mac
is
married
he
even
had
some
leave
out
of
this
here
hospital
getting
ready
for
artificial
arms
now
has
to
stay
put
for
a
while
yet
oh
it
takes
quite
a
while
this
business
of
making
a
man
again
wonderful
how
a
guy
can
pick
up
a
book
in
his
teeth
smoke
a
cigarette
even
with
a
little
help
further
down
the
line
there
a
chap
with
no
nose
and
a
very
young
boy
so
badly
burned
that
you
could
identify
a
feature
but
his
bright
blue
eyes
bright
and
hard
and
sharp
on
the
for
pity
do
let
your
lips
quiver
in
front
of
the
young
boy
do
look
at
him
with
tears
in
your
eyes
ca
you
see
how
he
feels
going
out
there
are
wheelchairs
doors
opening
on
to
rooms
where
wisps
of
men
like
grey
shadows
lie
curled
up
against
their
pillows
the
hospital
smell
clings
to
your
skin
to
your
palate
you
breathe
it
taste
it
stifle
in
it
dear
god
let
him
play
games
for
a
little
while
yet
let
him
laugh
out
loud
and
run
like
a
young
god
in
the
path
of
the
sun
i
have
been
to
a
military
hospital
and
i
know
there
is
nothing
we
can
give
to
mike
and
john
and
freddie
and
mac
that
will
make
up
for
their
gethsemane
there
is
nothing
glass
eyes
are
not
enough
artificial
limbs
are
not
a
fair
exchange
dear
god
let
him
play
games
for
a
little
while
yet
so
fair
a
season
how
could
he
tell
them
there
was
a
sleek
small
vixen
with
a
silken
pelt
who
held
his
heart
in
thrall
how
could
he
tell
them
when
that
call
came
down
the
wind
his
bones
were
with
longing
and
he
turned
his
back
on
the
pack
even
he
could
tell
the
strange
enchanted
reason
why
fall
should
suddenly
be
so
fair
a
season
spring
comes
to
a
small
town
the
pool
players
that
all
winter
long
have
lingered
lazily
over
the
tables
in
the
cloud
of
cigarette
smoke
are
seen
lounging
at
precarious
angles
against
the
nearest
tobacconist
windows
boys
and
girls
link
arms
and
on
the
paved
streets
shoulders
touching
and
laughter
like
a
living
thing
between
them
later
in
the
summer
they
will
dance
on
saturday
evenings
under
gaudy
chinese
lanterns
and
the
prophecy
of
spring
will
be
fulfilled
a
short
stout
lady
bustles
off
her
doorstep
broom
in
hand
to
do
a
little
sweeping
her
knitted
suit
fits
closely
like
the
sleek
green
plumage
of
a
plump
soft
bird
babies
babies
everywhere
bouncing
busily
in
their
prams
eyes
like
bits
of
sky
and
everyone
exclaiming
as
they
ride
past
is
he
a
darling
old
old
gentlemen
taking
little
walks
their
canes
tapping
the
sidewalk
more
and
more
confidently
you
can
see
how
they
feel
about
the
sun
it
a
downright
comfort
everything
looks
suddenly
clean
and
shining
the
lettuce
in
the
window
has
a
look
like
an
accidental
bouquet
it
suddenly
becomes
imperative
to
speak
to
someone
and
it
does
matter
in
the
least
if
a
perfect
stranger
goes
white
with
surprise
when
you
tell
them
it
a
lovely
day
in
no
uncertain
terms
spring
comes
to
a
small
town
in
rather
a
special
sort
of
way
after
all
she
ca
add
an
awful
lot
to
fifth
avenue
but
there
room
for
just
her
kind
of
glamour
on
main
street
for
a
brown
dog
and
the
rusted
spade
turned
in
the
dark
earth
and
we
committed
his
body
to
the
dust
his
little
brown
dog
body
that
three
minutes
before
had
jumped
for
joy
and
emitted
joyous
barks
but
you
could
go
out
and
shoot
the
motorist
who
had
run
over
him
especially
when
it
was
a
woman
who
had
shed
appropriate
tears
only
you
could
burn
inside
with
a
fierce
flame
because
he
would
come
running
to
you
any
more
with
a
grin
on
his
face
and
his
funny
little
plume
of
a
tail
frantic
with
love
the
rusted
spade
turned
in
the
dark
earth
and
something
of
you
went
into
the
ground
with
the
little
brown
dog
body
right
out
of
pickwick
right
out
of
pickwick
you
would
have
said
his
quaint
neat
figure
rotund
but
tapered
his
trousers
looked
to
be
always
narrowing
down
to
his
shining
foot
gear
his
woollen
vests
were
from
bond
street
checked
and
horsey
and
dear
to
his
heart
you
might
have
thought
him
a
figure
for
laughter
you
might
have
laughed
and
said
humpty
dumpty
if
you
had
known
him
and
had
loved
him
he
was
uncle
reg
to
the
young
and
the
old
he
was
uncle
reg
and
his
heart
was
gold
he
been
a
banker
for
many
years
and
then
he
retired
to
the
laughter
and
tears
of
nursing
his
mother
delicate
old
but
precious
to
him
she
thought
him
a
bold
brave
knight
who
chose
to
stay
at
her
side
you
hardly
saw
him
when
she
first
died
when
kathie
his
niece
married
the
mayor
a
tall
young
scotsman
with
sandy
hair
in
his
high
silk
hat
that
sat
just
so
old
uncle
reg
was
a
regular
beau
his
cravat
was
faultess
his
dignity
sweet
from
his
topper
top
to
his
gleaming
feet
on
birthdays
in
fine
spencerian
hand
a
letter
would
come
the
words
were
grand
and
the
style
heroic
in
dark
green
ink
uncle
reg
would
say
i
think
you
the
fairest
lady
this
side
of
the
sea
who
wears
her
birthdays
with
gaiety
you
have
my
wishes
for
scores
and
scores
and
the
letters
were
signed
admiringly
yours
there
come
a
bottle
of
fine
liqueur
at
christmas
a
gift
was
always
the
best
with
a
label
he
thought
it
a
very
test
of
friendship
you
thought
a
person
was
dear
and
fine
so
you
gave
him
your
choicest
rarest
wine
he
was
at
his
best
when
the
lights
were
high
and
laughter
gleamed
in
the
dancer
eye
he
never
would
ask
for
your
hand
outright
but
would
seek
your
partner
and
there
in
sight
would
ask
permission
to
squire
you
round
in
a
waltz
he
was
light
as
a
blowing
feather
his
conversation
was
always
whether
the
party
was
fun
for
you
compliments
came
to
his
lips
more
swift
than
the
dancing
music
whirling
lift
he
was
no
relation
to
us
by
blood
he
was
uncle
because
of
the
great
warm
flood
of
affection
we
adopted
him
right
from
the
time
we
met
and
he
uncle
reg
in
our
memory
yet
and
there
never
a
birthday
or
christmas
night
when
the
candles
burn
high
and
the
eyes
are
bright
but
a
gentle
whimsical
courtly
ghost
sits
at
our
table
we
miss
him
most
anniversary
times
right
out
of
pickwick
you
would
have
said
if
you
seen
hire
strolling
along
the
street
his
neat
small
figure
against
the
sky
but
uncle
reg
was
a
symbol
too
of
the
way
the
quality
used
to
do
what
was
expected
he
knew
the
rules
and
he
carried
them
out
to
the
last
fine
letter
somewhere
i
think
his
dear
small
ghost
treads
a
gay
measure
murmuring
most
sweet
gracious
lady
to
some
slim
shade
who
finds
him
a
gallant
entrancing
blade
man
is
a
lonely
one
man
is
a
lonely
one
how
close
he
huddles
to
his
hearth
and
house
walks
quiet
as
a
mouse
down
echoing
streets
gathers
about
him
neighbours
friends
puts
up
with
being
bored
while
endless
pointless
stories
roll
from
indifferent
lips
he
does
not
like
to
wake
in
an
empty
house
his
spouse
is
his
retreat
from
his
friendly
bosom
that
will
take
him
in
and
quiet
his
awareness
lull
him
to
comfort
and
insentient
peace
build
tender
walls
about
his
shivering
self
gather
within
the
crescent
of
her
arms
the
core
of
his
alarms
man
is
a
lonely
one
he
builds
himself
a
shelter
from
the
night
turns
himself
inward
where
the
lamplight
falls
takes
comfort
in
the
stoutness
of
four
walls
only
when
he
strides
out
to
face
a
gun
suddenly
strickenly
bravely
he
is
one
war
breaks
his
shell
and
spews
him
forth
alone
into
a
world
most
savagely
his
own
this
bitter
brew
this
is
a
bitter
brew
mixed
with
my
own
hand
i
recall
how
the
herbs
grew
flowering
over
the
land
how
the
wind
blew
sweet
and
your
eyes
held
the
sun
and
this
need
grew
in
my
heart
that
will
never
be
quite
done
a
cloud
furled
like
midnight
covered
the
rising
sea
and
slipt
like
a
raven
shadow
bitterly
over
me
you
knew
the
sudden
knowledge
that
filled
my
heart
with
fear
and
stood
against
the
darkness
as
long
as
you
were
here
it
was
tall
in
the
forest
browning
island
muskoka
it
was
tall
in
the
forest
this
morning
the
trees
were
on
tiptoe
with
their
shoulders
hunched
and
every
daisy
lifted
its
frill
skyward
down
the
lane
between
the
trees
i
was
a
sudden
giant
ho
i
said
to
a
tree
toad
who
crossed
my
path
out
of
the
way
small
fry
the
world
is
tall
and
walking
on
long
legs
ho
i
said
to
the
small
flat
one
out
of
the
way
child
waiting
in
a
her
room
reminded
me
of
a
rich
dark
there
was
a
about
it
a
claret
sort
of
aura
nervous
as
a
witch
on
a
sea
of
red
carpet
i
sat
on
the
edge
of
a
chair
longing
to
hide
behind
the
grave
grey
portieres
or
run
like
a
rabbit
from
her
step
on
the
stair
stars
and
the
dead
stars
and
the
dead
are
faithful
these
you
may
set
your
clock
by
promise
to
meet
at
a
time
and
such
a
place
the
living
can
keep
face
with
no
such
constancy
look
on
this
thing
with
disenchanted
eyes
do
not
expect
the
living
in
such
wise
the
old
lady
and
the
cat
at
the
very
top
storey
the
old
lady
sat
telling
her
love
to
a
smoky
grey
cat
in
a
high
dark
old
house
like
a
tenement
place
there
were
twinkles
of
merriment
touching
her
face
with
a
few
bits
of
bread
for
the
pigeons
to
eat
she
sat
in
her
eyrie
above
the
dark
street
and
the
language
she
spoke
to
the
cat
and
the
birds
was
half
made
of
poetry
half
made
of
words
she
was
something
remembered
from
tales
you
been
told
of
witchcraft
and
crones
when
you
were
very
old
from
beneath
those
high
eaves
in
the
middle
of
town
a
page
from
your
childhood
looked
piquantly
down
this
green
this
is
the
newest
green
as
if
an
unseen
leprechaun
rushing
across
the
lawn
had
tipped
his
hand
every
tree
is
filigree
there
is
a
brush
of
colour
in
the
hedges
the
scillas
and
the
tulip
spears
conspire
against
you
tenderness
runs
like
bright
fire
along
the
evening
turn
quickly
if
this
thing
can
get
you
down
this
green
this
little
love
that
wraps
the
town
when
i
was
small
and
it
would
rain
against
the
widest
i
press
my
face
and
taste
despair
and
streaked
with
woe
i
cry
unfair
useless
to
say
the
clouds
would
pass
the
lovely
rain
would
green
the
grass
would
drench
the
lilacs
wash
the
world
my
heart
was
small
and
tense
and
tight
as
a
snail
only
the
smell
of
sun
on
clover
could
make
me
glad
the
rain
was
over
could
set
me
free
to
walk
enchanted
the
fresh
bright
lanes
geared
like
a
am
i
by
what
goes
on
in
yonder
sky
noel
christmas
to
a
little
girl
when
she
is
small
means
a
toy
or
a
beautiful
doll
or
a
little
grey
muff
with
a
matching
fur
beautiful
beyond
words
these
to
her
christmas
to
a
woman
grown
is
different
again
it
all
tangled
crazily
with
mistletoe
and
men
with
stardust
and
flowers
and
tunes
for
dancing
feet
and
packets
out
of
jewellers
marked
my
sweet
but
best
of
all
later
on
best
of
all
three
it
children
eyes
by
candlelight
around
the
tree
immortal
we
may
be
now
a
sphere
apart
and
yet
i
find
you
in
my
heart
as
warm
and
live
as
once
you
were
a
little
stir
like
candle
flame
still
touches
me
your
very
name
can
call
you
up
to
quicken
me
to
trembling
silence
you
may
be
to
all
intents
and
purposes
as
far
away
as
yon
bright
star
that
pricks
the
midnight
very
far
a
love
can
be
and
yet
and
yet
there
is
no
way
i
may
forget
your
essence
the
you
that
walked
my
nights
and
days
i
carry
with
me
deep
inside
as
much
a
part
of
me
as
eyes
or
hands
or
lips
or
sudden
laughter
how
sweet
to
know
there
is
no
death
not
in
the
heart
that
is
a
breath
of
shaken
longing
and
you
come
to
company
me
and
i
am
dumb
with
this
bright
knowledge
certain
sure
this
then
is
deathless
does
endure
release
the
bird
in
my
breast
that
long
had
lain
ruffled
of
feather
drenched
with
rain
rises
to
fly
you
set
him
free
to
sing
himself
right
out
of
me
