main
street
for
i
like
to
look
at
the
blossomy
track
of
the
moon
upon
the
sea
but
it
is
half
so
fine
a
sight
as
main
street
used
to
be
when
it
all
was
covered
over
with
a
couple
of
feet
of
snow
and
over
the
crisp
and
radiant
road
the
ringing
sleighs
would
go
now
main
street
bordered
with
autumn
leaves
it
was
a
pleasant
thing
and
its
gutters
were
gay
with
dandelions
early
in
the
spring
i
like
to
think
of
it
white
with
frost
or
dusty
in
the
heat
because
i
think
it
is
humaner
than
any
other
street
a
city
street
that
is
busy
and
wide
is
ground
by
a
thousand
wheels
and
a
burden
of
traffic
on
its
breast
is
all
it
ever
feels
it
is
dully
conscious
of
weight
and
speed
and
of
work
that
never
ends
but
it
can
not
be
human
like
main
street
and
recognise
its
friends
there
were
only
about
a
hundred
teams
on
main
street
in
a
day
and
twenty
or
thirty
people
i
guess
and
some
children
out
to
play
and
there
was
a
wagon
or
buggy
or
a
man
or
a
girl
or
a
boy
that
main
street
did
remember
and
somehow
seem
to
enjoy
the
truck
and
the
motor
and
trolley
car
and
the
elevated
train
they
make
the
weary
city
street
reverberate
with
pain
but
there
is
yet
an
echo
left
deep
down
within
my
heart
of
the
music
the
main
street
cobblestones
made
beneath
a
butcher
cart
god
be
thanked
for
the
milky
way
that
runs
across
the
sky
that
the
path
that
my
feet
would
tread
whenever
i
have
to
die
some
folks
call
it
a
silver
sword
and
some
a
pearly
crown
but
the
only
thing
i
think
it
is
is
main
street
heaventown
roofs
for
amelia
josephine
burr
the
road
is
wide
and
the
stars
are
out
and
the
breath
of
the
night
is
sweet
and
this
is
the
time
when
wanderlust
should
seize
upon
my
feet
but
i
glad
to
turn
from
the
open
road
and
the
starlight
on
my
face
and
to
leave
the
splendour
of
for
a
human
dwelling
place
i
never
have
seen
a
vagabond
who
really
liked
to
roam
all
up
and
down
the
streets
of
the
world
and
not
to
have
a
home
the
tramp
who
slept
in
your
barn
last
night
and
left
at
break
of
day
will
wander
only
until
he
finds
another
place
to
stay
a
will
sleep
in
his
cart
with
canvas
overhead
or
else
he
go
into
his
tent
when
it
is
time
for
bed
he
sit
on
the
grass
and
take
his
ease
so
long
as
the
sun
is
high
but
when
it
is
dark
he
wants
a
roof
to
keep
away
the
sky
if
you
call
a
gypsy
a
vagabond
i
think
you
do
him
wrong
for
he
never
goes
but
he
takes
his
home
along
and
the
only
reason
a
road
is
good
as
every
wanderer
knows
is
just
because
of
the
homes
the
homes
the
homes
to
which
it
goes
they
say
that
life
is
a
highway
and
its
milestones
are
the
years
and
now
and
then
there
a
where
you
buy
your
way
with
tears
it
a
rough
road
and
a
steep
road
and
it
stretches
broad
and
far
but
at
last
it
leads
to
a
golden
town
where
golden
houses
are
the
snowman
in
the
yard
for
thomas
augustine
daly
the
judge
house
has
a
splendid
porch
with
pillars
and
steps
of
stone
and
the
judge
has
a
lovely
flowering
hedge
that
came
from
across
the
seas
in
the
hales
garage
you
could
put
my
house
and
everything
i
own
and
the
hales
have
a
lawn
like
an
emerald
and
a
row
of
poplar
trees
now
i
have
only
a
little
house
and
only
a
little
lot
and
only
a
few
square
yards
of
lawn
with
dandelions
starred
but
when
winter
comes
i
have
something
there
that
the
judge
and
the
hales
have
not
and
it
better
worth
having
than
all
their
wealth
it
a
snowman
in
the
yard
the
judge
money
brings
architects
to
make
his
mansion
fair
the
hales
have
seven
gardeners
to
make
their
roses
grow
the
judge
can
get
his
trees
from
spain
and
france
and
everywhere
and
raise
his
orchids
under
glass
in
the
midst
of
all
the
snow
but
i
have
something
no
architect
or
gardener
ever
made
a
thing
that
is
shaped
by
the
busy
touch
of
little
mittened
hands
and
the
judge
would
give
up
his
lonely
estate
where
the
level
snow
is
laid
for
the
tiny
house
with
the
trampled
yard
the
yard
where
the
snowman
stands
they
say
that
after
adam
and
eve
were
driven
away
in
tears
to
toil
and
suffer
their
through
because
of
the
sin
they
sinned
the
lord
made
winter
to
punish
them
for
half
their
exiled
years
to
chill
their
blood
with
the
snow
and
pierce
their
flesh
with
the
icy
wind
but
we
who
inherit
the
primal
curse
and
labour
for
our
bread
have
yet
thank
god
the
gift
of
home
though
eden
gate
is
barred
and
through
the
winter
crystal
veil
love
roses
blossom
red
for
him
who
lives
in
a
house
that
has
a
snowman
in
the
yard
a
blue
valentine
for
aline
monsignore
right
reverend
bishop
valentinus
sometime
of
interamna
which
is
called
ferni
now
of
the
delightful
court
of
heaven
i
respectfully
salute
you
i
genuflect
and
i
kiss
your
episcopal
ring
it
is
not
monsignore
the
fragrant
memory
of
your
holy
life
nor
that
of
your
shining
and
joyous
martyrdom
which
causes
me
now
to
address
you
but
since
this
is
your
august
festival
monsignore
it
seems
appropriate
to
me
to
state
according
to
a
venerable
and
agreeable
custom
that
i
love
a
beautiful
lady
her
eyes
monsignore
are
so
blue
that
they
put
lovely
little
blue
reflections
on
everything
that
she
looks
at
such
as
a
wall
or
the
moon
or
my
heart
it
is
like
the
light
coming
through
blue
stained
glass
yet
not
quite
like
it
for
the
blueness
is
not
transparent
only
translucent
her
soul
light
shines
through
but
her
soul
can
not
be
seen
it
is
something
elusive
whimsical
tender
wanton
infantile
wise
and
noble
she
wears
monsignore
a
blue
garment
made
in
the
manner
of
the
japanese
it
is
very
blue
i
think
that
her
eyes
have
made
it
more
blue
sweetly
staining
it
as
the
pressure
of
her
body
has
graciously
given
it
form
loving
her
monsignore
i
love
all
her
attributes
but
i
believe
that
even
if
i
did
not
love
her
i
would
love
the
blueness
of
her
eyes
and
her
blue
garment
made
in
the
manner
of
the
japanese
monsignore
i
have
never
before
troubled
you
with
a
request
the
saints
whose
ears
i
chiefly
worry
with
my
pleas
are
the
most
exquisite
and
maternal
brigid
gallant
saint
stephen
who
puts
fire
in
my
blood
and
your
brother
bishop
my
patron
the
generous
and
jovial
saint
nicholas
of
bari
but
of
your
courtesy
monsignore
do
me
this
favour
when
you
this
morning
make
your
way
to
the
ivory
throne
that
bursts
into
bloom
with
roses
because
of
her
who
sits
upon
it
when
you
come
to
pay
your
devoir
to
our
lady
i
beg
you
say
to
her
madame
a
poor
poet
one
of
your
singing
servants
yet
on
earth
has
asked
me
to
say
that
at
this
moment
he
is
especially
grateful
to
you
for
wearing
a
blue
gown
houses
for
aline
when
you
shall
die
and
to
the
sky
serenely
delicately
go
saint
peter
when
he
sees
you
there
will
clash
his
keys
and
say
now
talk
to
her
sir
christopher
and
hurry
michelangelo
she
wants
to
play
at
building
and
you
got
to
help
her
play
every
architect
will
help
erect
a
palace
on
a
lawn
of
cloud
with
rainbow
beams
and
a
sunset
roof
and
a
level
floor
and
at
your
will
you
may
use
the
skill
of
this
gay
angelic
crowd
when
a
house
is
made
you
will
throw
it
down
and
they
build
you
twenty
more
for
christopher
wren
and
these
other
men
who
used
to
build
on
earth
will
love
to
go
to
work
again
if
they
may
work
for
you
this
porch
you
say
should
go
this
way
and
they
work
for
all
they
worth
and
they
come
to
your
palace
every
morning
and
ask
you
what
to
do
and
when
night
comes
down
on
if
there
should
be
night
up
there
you
will
choose
the
house
you
like
the
best
of
all
that
you
can
see
and
its
walls
will
glow
as
you
drowsily
go
to
the
bed
up
the
golden
stair
and
i
hope
you
be
gentle
enough
to
keep
a
room
in
your
house
for
me
in
memory
i
serene
and
beautiful
and
very
wise
most
erudite
in
curious
grecian
lore
you
lay
and
read
your
learned
books
and
bore
a
weight
of
unshed
tears
and
silent
sighs
the
song
within
your
heart
could
never
rise
until
love
bade
it
spread
its
wings
and
soar
nor
could
you
look
on
beauty
face
before
a
poet
burning
mouth
had
touched
your
eyes
love
is
made
out
of
ecstasy
and
wonder
love
is
a
poignant
and
accustomed
pain
it
is
a
burst
of
thunder
it
is
a
linnet
fluting
after
rain
love
voice
is
through
your
song
above
and
under
and
in
each
note
to
echo
and
remain
ii
because
mankind
is
glad
and
brave
and
young
full
of
gay
flames
that
white
and
scarlet
glow
all
joys
and
passions
that
mankind
may
know
by
you
were
nobly
felt
and
nobly
sung
because
mankind
heart
every
day
is
wrung
by
fate
wild
hands
that
twist
and
tear
it
so
therefore
you
echoed
man
undying
woe
a
harp
aeolian
on
life
branches
hung
so
did
the
ghosts
of
toiling
children
hover
about
the
piteous
portals
of
your
mind
your
eyes
that
looked
on
glory
could
discover
the
angry
scar
to
which
the
world
was
blind
and
it
was
grief
that
made
mankind
your
lover
and
it
was
grief
that
made
you
love
mankind
iii
before
christ
left
the
citadel
of
light
to
tread
the
dreadful
way
of
human
birth
his
shadow
sometimes
fell
upon
the
earth
and
those
who
saw
it
wept
with
joy
and
fright
thou
art
apollo
than
the
sun
more
bright
they
cried
our
music
is
of
little
worth
but
thrill
our
blood
with
thy
creative
mirth
thou
god
of
song
thou
lord
of
lyric
might
o
singing
pilgrim
who
could
love
and
follow
your
lover
christ
through
even
love
despair
you
knew
within
the
hollow
the
feet
that
on
the
mountain
are
so
fair
for
it
was
christ
that
was
your
own
apollo
and
thorns
were
in
the
laurel
on
your
hair
apology
for
eleanor
rogers
cox
for
blows
on
the
fort
of
evil
that
never
shows
a
breach
for
terrible
races
to
a
goal
no
foot
can
reach
for
reckless
leaps
into
darkness
with
hands
outstretched
to
a
star
there
is
jubilation
in
heaven
where
the
great
dead
poets
are
there
is
joy
over
disappointment
and
delight
in
hopes
that
were
vain
each
poet
is
glad
there
was
no
cure
to
stop
his
lonely
pain
for
nothing
keeps
a
poet
in
his
high
singing
mood
like
unappeasable
hunger
for
unattainable
food
so
fools
are
glad
of
the
folly
that
made
them
weep
and
sing
and
keats
is
thankful
for
fanny
brawne
and
drummond
for
his
king
they
know
that
on
flinty
sorrow
and
failure
and
desire
the
steel
of
their
souls
was
hammered
to
bring
forth
the
lyric
fire
lord
byron
and
shelley
and
plunkett
mcdonough
and
hunt
and
pearse
see
now
why
their
hatred
of
tyrants
was
so
insistently
fierce
is
freedom
only
a
to
cheat
a
poet
eye
be
it
phantom
or
fact
it
a
noble
cause
in
which
to
sing
and
to
die
so
not
for
the
rainbow
taken
and
the
magical
white
bird
snared
the
poets
sing
grateful
carols
in
the
place
to
which
they
have
fared
but
for
their
lifetime
passion
the
quest
that
was
fruitless
and
long
they
chorus
their
loud
thanksgiving
to
the
master
of
song
the
proud
poet
for
shaemas
o
sheel
one
winter
night
a
devil
came
and
sat
upon
my
bed
his
eyes
were
full
of
laughter
for
his
heart
was
full
of
crime
why
do
you
take
up
fancy
work
or
embroidery
he
said
for
a
needle
is
as
manly
a
tool
as
a
pen
that
makes
a
rhyme
you
little
ugly
devil
said
i
go
back
to
hell
for
the
idea
you
express
i
will
not
listen
to
i
have
trouble
enough
with
poetry
and
poverty
as
well
without
having
to
pay
attention
to
orators
like
you
when
you
say
of
the
making
of
ballads
and
songs
that
it
is
woman
work
you
forget
all
the
fighting
poets
that
have
been
in
every
land
there
was
byron
who
left
all
his
to
fight
against
the
turk
and
david
the
singing
king
of
the
jews
who
was
born
with
a
sword
in
his
hand
it
was
yesterday
that
rupert
brooke
went
out
to
the
wars
and
died
and
sir
philip
sidney
lyric
voice
was
as
sweet
as
his
arm
was
strong
and
sir
walter
raleigh
met
the
axe
as
a
lover
meets
his
bride
because
he
carried
in
his
soul
the
courage
of
his
song
and
there
is
no
consolation
so
quickening
to
the
heart
as
the
warmth
and
whiteness
that
come
from
the
lines
of
noble
poetry
it
is
strong
joy
to
read
it
when
the
wounds
of
the
spirit
smart
it
puts
the
flame
in
a
lonely
breast
where
only
ashes
be
it
is
strong
joy
to
read
it
and
to
make
it
is
a
thing
that
exalts
a
man
with
a
sacreder
pride
than
any
pride
on
earth
for
it
makes
him
kneel
to
a
broken
slave
and
set
his
foot
on
a
king
and
it
shakes
the
walls
of
his
little
soul
with
the
echo
of
god
mirth
there
was
the
poet
homer
had
the
sorrow
to
be
blind
yet
a
hundred
people
with
good
eyes
would
listen
to
him
all
night
for
they
took
great
enjoyment
in
the
heaven
of
his
mind
and
were
glad
when
the
old
blind
poet
let
them
share
his
powers
of
sight
and
there
was
heine
lying
on
his
mattress
all
day
long
he
had
no
wealth
he
had
no
friends
he
had
no
joy
at
all
except
to
pour
his
sorrow
into
little
cups
of
song
and
the
world
finds
in
them
the
magic
wine
that
his
broken
heart
let
fall
and
these
are
only
a
couple
of
names
from
a
list
of
a
thousand
score
who
have
put
their
glory
on
the
world
in
poverty
and
pain
and
the
title
of
poet
a
noble
thing
worth
living
and
dying
for
though
all
the
devils
on
earth
and
in
hell
spit
at
me
their
disdain
it
is
stern
work
it
is
perilous
work
to
thrust
your
hand
in
the
sun
and
pull
out
a
spark
of
immortal
flame
to
warm
the
hearts
of
men
but
prometheus
torn
by
the
claws
and

in

came
candescent
pure
a
cup
of

bloomed
for
a

and
left
the

more
fair
and
was
it
charles
thy
fair
and

who
bade

was
a

and

he
opened
up
the
stable
the
night
our
lady
came
our
lady
and
saint
joseph
he
gave

food
and

and
jesus

has
given
him
a

round

at

and
let
your

across

there
was
a
courteous
hostler
he
is
in

he
held
our
lady
bridle
and
helped
her
to
alight
he
spread
clean
straw
before
her
whereon
she
might
lie
down
and
jesus
christ
has
given
him
an
everlasting
crown
unlock
the
door
this
evening
and
let
your

wide
let
all
who
ask

come

if
your

be
narrow
what
if
your

be
small
there
is
a

is
coming
will
glorify
it
all
there
was
a
joyous
hostler
who
knelt
on
christmas
morn
beside
the
radiant
manger
wherein
his
lord
was
born
his
heart
was
full
of
laughter
his
soul
was
full
of
bliss
when
jesus
on
his
mother
lap
gave
him
his
hand
to
kiss
unbar
your
heart
this
evening
and
keep
no
stranger
out
take
from
your
soul
great
portal
the
barrier
of
doubt
to
humble
folk
and
weary
give
hearty
welcoming
your
breast
shall
be
the
cradle
of
a
king
the
robe
of
christ
for
cecil
chesterton
at
the
foot
of
the
cross
on
calvary
three
soldiers
sat
and
diced
and
one
of
them
was
the
devil
and
he
won
the
robe
of
christ
when
the
devil
comes
in
his
proper
form
to
the
chamber
where
i
dwell
i
know
him
and
make
the
sign
of
the
cross
which
drives
him
back
to
hell
and
when
he
comes
like
a
friendly
man
and
puts
his
hand
in
mine
the
fervour
in
his
voice
is
not
from
love
or
joy
or
wine
and
when
he
comes
like
a
woman
with
lovely
smiling
eyes
black
dreams
float
over
his
golden
head
like
a
swarm
of
carrion
flies
now
many
a
million
tortured
souls
in
his
red
halls
there
be
why
does
he
spend
his
subtle
craft
in
hunting
after
me
kings
queens
and
crested
warriors
whose
memory
rings
through
time
these
are
his
prey
and
what
to
him
is
this
poor
man
of
rhyme
that
he
with
such
laborious
skill
should
change
from
role
to
role
should
daily
act
so
many
a
part
to
get
my
little
soul
oh
he
can
be
the
forest
and
he
can
be
the
sun
or
a
buttercup
or
an
hour
of
rest
when
the
weary
day
is
done
i
saw
him
through
a
thousand
veils
and
has
not
this
sufficed
now
must
i
look
on
the
devil
robed
in
the
radiant
robe
of
christ
he
comes
and
his
face
is
sad
and
mild
with
thorns
his
head
is
crowned
there
are
great
bleeding
wounds
in
his
feet
and
in
each
hand
a
wound
how
can
i
tell
who
am
a
fool
if
this
be
christ
or
no
those
bleeding
hands
outstretched
to
me
those
eyes
that
love
me
so
i
see
the
robe
i
look
i
hope
i
fear
but
there
is
one
who
will
direct
my
troubled
mind
christ
mother
knows
her
son
o
mother
of
good
counsel

intelligence
to
me
encompass
me

wisdom

is
the
man
of

says
disguised
with
fearful
art
he
has
the
wounded
hands
and
feet
but
not
the
wounded
heart
beside
the
cross
on

she
watched
them
as
they

roses
for

and
twine
them
in
a
ring

from

bush
and
from
the
red

but
when
i
took
my
posy
and
laid
it
at
his
feet
i
found
he
had
his
roses
a
million
times
more
sweet
there
was
a
scarlet
blossom
upon
each
foot
and
hand
and
a
great
pink
rose
bloomed
from
his
side
for
the
healing
of
the
land
now
of
this
fair
and
awful
king
there
is
this
marvel
told
that
he
wears
a
crown
of
linked
thorns
instead
of
one
of
gold
where
there
are
thorns
are
roses
and
i
saw
a
line
of
red
a
little
wreath
of
roses
around
his
radiant
head
a
red
rose
is
his
sacred
heart
a
white
rose
is
his
face
and
his
breath
has
turned
the
barren

to
a
rich
and

for
i
take
my
leave
with
sorrow
of
him
i
love
so
well
i
look
my
last
upon
his
small
and
radiant
o
happy
lamp
to
serve
him
with
never
ceasing
light
o
happy
flame
to
tremble
forever
in
his
sight
i
leave
the
holy
quiet
for
the
loudly
human
train
and
my
heart
that
he
has
breathed
upon
is
filled
with
lonely
pain
o
king
o
friend
o
lover
what
sorer
grief
can
be
in
all
the
reddest
depths
of
hell
than
banishment
from
thee
but
from
my
window
as
i
speed
across
the
sleeping
land
i
see
the
towns
and
villages
wherein
his
houses
stand
above
the
roofs
i
see
a
cross
outlined
against
the
night
and
i
know
that
there
my
lover
dwells
in
his
sacramental
might
dominions
kneel
before
him
and
powers
kiss
his
feet
yet
for
me
he
keeps
his
weary
watch
in
the
turmoil
of
the
street
the
king
of
kings
awaits
me
wherever
i
may
go
o
who
am
i
that
he
should
deign
to
love
and
serve
me
so
thanksgiving
for
john
bunker
the
roar
of
the
world
is
in
my
ears
thank
god
for
the
roar
of
the
world
thank
god
for
the
mighty
tide
of
fears
against
me
always
hurled
thank
god
for
the
bitter
and
ceaseless
strife
and
the
sting
of
his
chastening
rod
thank
god
for
the
stress
and
the
pain
of
life
and
oh
thank
god
for
god
the
thorn
for
the
rev
charles
the
garden
of
god
is
a
radiant
place
and
every
flower
has
a
holy
face
our
lady
like
a
lily
bends
above
the
cloudy
sod
but
saint
michael
is
the
thorn
on
the
rosebush
of
god
david
is
the
song
upon
god
lips
and
our
lady
is
the
goblet
that
he
sips
and
gabriel
the
breath
of
his
command
but
saint
michael
is
the
sword
in
god
right
hand
the
ivory
tower
is
fair
to
see
and
may
her
walls
encompass
me
but
when
the
devil
comes
with
the
thunder
of
his
might
saint
michael
show
me
how
to
fight
the
big
top
the
boom
and
blare
of
the
big
brass
band
is
cheering
to
my
heart
and
i
like
the
smell
of
the
trampled
grass
and
elephants
and
hay
i
take
off
my
hat
to
the
acrobat
with
his
delicate
strong
art
and
the
motley
mirth
of
the
clown
drives
all
my
care
away
i
wish
i
could
feel
as
they
must
feel
these
players
brave
and
fair
who
nonchalantly
juggle
death
before
a
staring
throng
it
must
be
fine
to
walk
a
line
of
silver
in
the
air
and
to
cleave
a
hundred
feet
of
space
with
a
gesture
like
a
song
sir
henry
irving
never
knew
a
keener
sweeter
thrill
than
that
which
stirs
the
breast
of
him
who
turns
his
painted
face
to
the
circling
crowd
who
laugh
aloud
and
clap
hands
with
a
will
as
a
tribute
to
the
clown
who
won
the
great
race
now
one
shall
work
in
the
living
rock
with
a
mallet
and
a
knife
and
another
shall
dance
on
a
big
white
horse
that
canters
round
a
ring
by
another
hand
shall
colours
stand
in
similitude
of
life
and
the
hearts
of
the
three
shall
be
moved
by
one
mysterious
high
thing
for
the
sculptor
and
the
acrobat
and
the
painter
are
the
same
they
know
one
hope
one
fear
one
pride
one
sorrow
and
one
mirth
and
they
take
delight
in
the
endless
fight
for
the
fickle
world
acclaim
for
they
worship
art
above
the
clouds
and
serve
her
on
the
earth
but
you
who
can
build
of
the
stubborn
rock
no
form
of
loveliness
who
can
never
mingle
the
radiant
hues
to
make
a
wonder
live
who
can
only
show
your
little
woe
to
the
world
in
a
rhythmic
dress
what
kind
of
a
counterpart
of
you
does
the
circus
give
well
here
in
the
little
tent
some
people
stand
one
is
a
giant
one
a
dwarf
and
one
has
a
figured
skin
and
each
is
scarred
and
seared
and
marred
by
fate
relentless
hand
and
each
one
shows
his
grief
for
pay
with
a
sort
of
pride
therein
you
put
your
sorrow
into
rhyme
and
want
the
world
to
look
you
sing
the
news
of
your
ruined
hope
and
want
the
world
to
hear
their
woe
is
pent
in
a
canvas
tent
and
yours
in
a
printed
book
o
poet
of
the
broken
heart
salute
your
brothers
here
queen
elizabeth
speaks
my
hands
were
stained
with
blood
my
heart
was
proud
and
cold
my
soul
is
black
with
shame
but
i
gave
shakespeare
gold
so
after
aeons
of
flame
i
may
by
grace
of
god
rise
up
to
kiss
the
dust
that
shakespeare
feet
have
trod
in
for
my
mother
the
fragile
splendour
of
the
level
sea
the
moon
serene
and
face
make
of
this
vessel
an
enchanted
place
full
of
white
mirth
and
golden
sorcery
now
for
a
time
shall
careless
laughter
be
blended
with
song
to
lend
song
sweeter
grace
and
the
old
stars
in
their
unending
race
shall
heed
and
envy
young
humanity
and
yet
a
hundred
leagues
away
these
waters
blush
a
strange
and
awful
red
before
the
moon
a
cloud
obscenely
grey
rises
from
decks
that
crash
with
flying
lead
and
these
stars
smile
their
immemorial
way
on
waves
that
shroud
a
thousand
newly
dead
in
memory
of
rupert
brooke
in
alien
earth
across
a
troubled
sea
his
body
lies
that
was
so
fair
and
young
his
mouth
is
stopped
with
half
his
songs
unsung
his
arm
is
still
that
struck
to
make
men
free
but
let
no
cloud
of
lamentation
be
where
on
a
warrior
grave
a
lyre
is
hung
we
keep
the
echoes
of
his
golden
tongue
we
keep
the
vision
of
his
chivalry
so
israel
joy
the
loveliest
of
kings
smote
now
his
harp
and
now
the
hostile
horde
the
starry
roof
of
heaven
rings
with
psalms
a
soldier
made
to
praise
his
lord
and
david
rests
beneath
eternal
wings
song
on
his
lips
and
in
his
hand
a
sword
the
new
school
for
my
mother
the
halls
that
were
loud
with
the
merry
tread
of
young
and
careless
feet
are
still
with
a
stillness
that
is
too
drear
to
seem
like
holiday
and
never
a
gust
of
laughter
breaks
the
calm
of
the
dreaming
street
or
rises
to
shake
the
ivied
walls
and
frighten
the
doves
away
the
dust
is
on
book
and
on
empty
desk
and
the
and
balls
lie
still
in
their
lonely
locker
and
wait
for
a
game
that
is
never
played
and
over
the
study
and
and
the
river
and
meadow
falls
a
stern
peace
a
strange
peace
a
peace
that
war
has
made
for
many
a
youthful
shoulder
now
is
gay
with
an
epaulet
and
the
hand
that
was
deft
with
a
is
defter
with
a
sword
and
some
of
the
lads
will
laugh
where
the
trench
is
red
and
wet
and
some
will
win
on
the
bloody
field
the
accolade
of
the
lord
they
have
taken
their
youth
and
mirth
away
from
the
study
and
to
a
new
school
in
an
alien
land
beneath
an
alien
sky
out
in
the
smoke
and
roar
of
the
fight
their
lessons
and
games
are
found
and
they
who
were
learning
how
to
live
are
learning
how
to
die
and
after
the
golden
day
has
come
and
the
war
is
at
an
end
a
slab
of
bronze
on
the
chapel
wall
will
tell
of
the
noble
dead
and
every
name
on
that
radiant
list
will
be
the
name
of
a
friend
a
name
that
shall
through
the
centuries
in
grateful
prayers
be
said
and
there
will
be

he
who
walks
through
the
meadows
of
champagne
at
noon
in
fall
when
leaves
like
gold
appear
sees
it
draw
near
like
some
great
mountain
set
upon
the
plain
from
radiant
dawn
until
the
close
of
day
nearer
it
grows
to
him
who
goes
across
the
country
when
tall
towers
lay
their
shadowy
pall
upon
his
way
he
enters
where
the
solid
stone
is
hollowed
deep
by
all
its
centuries
of
beauty
and
of
prayer
ancient
french
temple
thou
whose
hundred
kings
watch
over
thee
emblazoned
on
thy
walls
tell
me
within
thy
halls
what
chant
of
triumph
or
what
rings
thou
hast
known
clovis
and
his
frankish
train
whose
mighty
hand
saint
remy
hand
did
keep
and
in
thy
spacious
vault
perhaps
may
sleep
an
echo
of
the
voice
of
charlemagne
for
god
thou
has
known
fear
when
from
his
side
men
wandered
seeking
alien
shrines
and
new
but
still
the
sky
was
bountiful
and
blue
and
thou
wast
crowned
with
france
love
and
pride
sacred
thou
art
from
pinnacle
to
base
and
in
thy
panes
of
gold
and
scarlet
glass
the
setting
sun
sees
thousandfold
his
face
sorrow
and
joy
in
stately
silence
pass
across
thy
walls
the
shadow
and
the
light
around
thy
lofty
pillars
tapers
white
illuminate
with
delicate
sharp
flames
the
brows
of
saints
with
venerable
names
and
in
the
night
erect
a
fiery
wall
a
great
but
silent
fervour
burns
in
all
those
simple
folk
who
kneel
pathetic
dumb
and
know
that
down
below
beside
the
rhine
cannon
horses
soldiers
flags
in
line
with
blare
of
trumpets
mighty
armies
come
suddenly
each
knows
fear
swift
rumours
pass
that
every
one
must
hear
the
hostile
banners
blaze
against
the
sky
and
by
the
embassies
mobs
rage
and
cry
now
war
has
come
and
peace
is
at
an
end
on
paris
town
the
german
troops
descend
they
are
turned
back
and
driven
to
champagne
and
now
as
to
so
many
weary
men
the
glorious
temple
gives
them
welcome
when
it
meets
them
at
the
bottom
of
the
plain
at
once
they
set
their
cannon
in
its
way
there
is
no
gable
now
nor
wall
that
does
not
suffer
night
and
day
as
shot
and
shell
in
crushing
torrents
fall
the
stricken
tocsin
quivers
through
the
tower
the
triple
nave
the
apse
the
lonely
choir
are
circled
hour
by
hour
with
thundering
bands
of
fire
and
death
is
scattered
broadcast
among
men
and
then
that
which
was
splendid
with
baptismal
grace
the
stately
arches
soaring
into
space
the
transepts
columns
windows
gray
and
gold
the
organ
in
whose
tones
the
ocean
rolled
the
crypts
of
mighty
shades
the
dwelling
places
the
virgin
gentle
hands
the
saints
pure
faces
all
even
the
pardoning
hands
of
christ
the
lord
were
struck
and
broken
by
the
wanton
sword
of
sacrilegious
lust
o
beauty
slain
o
glory
in
the
dust
strong
walls
of
faith
most
basely
overthrown
the
crawling
flames
like
adders
glistening
ate
the
white
fabric
of
this
lovely
thing
now
from
its
soul
arose
a
piteous
moan
the
soul
that
always
loved
the
just
and
fair
granite
and
marble
loud
their
woe
confessed
the
silver
monstrances
that
popes
had
blessed
the
chalices
and
lamps
and
crosiers
rare
were
seared
and
twisted
by
a
flaming
breath
the
horror
everywhere
did
range
and
swell
the
guardian
saints
into
this
furnace
fell
their
bitter
tears
and
screams
were
stilled
in
death
around
the
flames
armed
hosts
are
skirmishing
the
burning
sun
reflects
the
lurid
scene
the
german
army
fighting
for
its
life
rallies
its
torn
and
terrified
left
wing
and
as
they
near
this
place
the
imperial
eagles
see
before
them
in
their
flight
here
in
the
solemn
night
the
old
cathedral
to
the
years
to
be
showing
with
wounded
arms
their
own
disgrace
kings
for
the
rev
james
dollard
the
kings
of
the
earth
are
men
of
might
and
cities
are
burned
for
their
delight
and
the
skies
rain
death
in
the
silent
night
and
the
hills
belch
death
all
day
but
the
king
of
heaven
who
made
them
all
is
fair
and
gentle
and
very
small
he
lies
in
the
straw
by
the
oxen
stall
let
them
think
of
him
the
white
ships
and
the
red
for
alden
march
with
drooping
sail
and
pennant
that
never
a
wind
may
reach
they
float
in
sunless
waters
beside
a
sunless
beach
their
mighty
masts
and
funnels
are
white
as
driven
snow
and
with
a
pallid
radiance
their
ghostly
bulwarks
glow
here
is
a
spanish
galleon
that
once
with
gold
was
gay
here
is
a
roman
trireme
whose
hues
outshone
the
day
but
tyrian
dyes
have
faded
and
prows
that
once
were
bright
with
rainbow
stains
wear
only
death
livid
dreadful
white
white
as
the
ice
that
clove
her
that
unforgotten
day
among
her
pallid
sisters
the
grim
titanic
lay
and
through
the
leagues
above
her
she
looked
aghast
and
said
what
is
this
living
ship
that
comes
where
every
ship
is
dead
the
ghostly
vessels
trembled
from
ruined
stern
to
prow
what
was
this
thing
of
terror
that
broke
their
vigil
now
down
through
the
startled
ocean
a
mighty
vessel
came
not
white
as
all
dead
ships
must
be
but
red
like
living
flame
the
pale
green
waves
about
her
were
swiftly
strangely
dyed
by
the
great
scarlet
stream
that
flowed
from
out
her
wounded
side
and
all
her
decks
were
scarlet
and
all
her
shattered
crew
she
sank
among
the
white
ghost
ships
and
stained
them
through
and
through
the
grim
titanic
greeted
her
and
who
art
thou
she
said
why
dost
thou
join
our
ghostly
fleet
arrayed
in
living
red
we
are
the
ships
of
sorrow
who
spend
the
weary
night
until
the
dawn
of
judgment
day
obscure
and
still
and
white
nay
said
the
scarlet
visitor
though
i
sink
through
the
sea
a
ruined
thing
that
was
a
ship
i
sink
not
as
did
ye
for
ye
met
with
your
destiny
by
storm
or
rock
or
fight
so
through
the
lagging
centuries
ye
wear
your
robes
of
white
but
never
crashing
iceberg
nor
honest
shot
of
foe
nor
hidden
reef
has
sent
me
the
way
that
i
must
go
my
wound
that
stains
the
waters
my
blood
that
is
like
flame
bear
witness
to
a
loathly
deed
a
deed
without
a
name
i
went
not
forth
to
battle
i
carried
friendly
men
the
children
played
about
my
decks
the
women
sang
and
then
and
then
the
sun
blushed
scarlet
and
heaven
hid
its
face
the
world
that
god
created
became
a
shameful
place
my
wrong
cries
out
for
vengeance
the
blow
that
sent
me
here
was
aimed
in
hell
my
dying
scream
has
reached
jehovah
ear
not
all
the
seven
oceans
shall
wash
away
that
stain
upon
a
brow
that
wears
a
crown
i
am
the
brand
of
cain
when
god
great
voice
assembles
the
fleet
on
judgment
day
the
ghosts
of
ruined
ships
will
rise
in
sea
and
strait
and
bay
though
they
have
lain
for
ages
beneath
the
changeless
flood
they
shall
be
white
as
silver
but
one
shall
be
like
blood
