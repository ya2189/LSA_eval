tournament
under
nightmare
skies
when
kit
temple
was
drafted
for
the
nowhere
journey
he
figured
that
he
left
his
home
his
girl
and
the
earth
for
good
for
though
those
called
were
always
promised
rotation
not
a
man
had
ever
returned
from
that
mysterious
flight
into
the
unknown
kit
arkalion
the
young
man
with
the
strange
eyes
seemed
to
know
more
than
he
should
so
when
kit
twisted
the
tail
of
fate
and
followed
arkalion
to
the
ends
of
space
and
time
he
found
the
secret
behind
nowhere
and
a
personal
challenge
upon
which
the
entire
future
of
earth
depended
chapter
i
when
the
first
strong
sunlight
of
may
covered
the
avenues
of
center
city
with
green
the
riots
started
the
people
gathered
in
angry
knots
outside
the
city
hall
met
in
the
park
and
littered
its
walks
with
newspapers
and
magazines
as
they
gobbled
up
editorial
comment
at
a
furious
rate
slipped
with
dark
of
night
through
back
alleys
and
planned
things
with
furious
futility
center
city
finest
knew
when
to
make
themselves
scarce
their
uniforms
stood
for
everything
objectionable
at
this
time
and
they
might
be
subjected
to
clubs
stones
taunts
threats
leers
and
knives
but
center
city
like
most
communities
in
united
north
america
had
survived
the
riots
before
and
would
survive
them
again
on
past
performances
the
damage
could
be
estimated
too
plate
glass
windows
would
be
broken
twelve
limbs
fractured
several
thousand
people
would
be
treated
for
minor
bruises
and
abrasions
center
city
would
receive
half
that
many
damage
suits
the
list
had
been
drawn
clearly
and
accurately
it
hardly
ever
deviated
and
center
city
would
meet
its
quota
with
a
demonstration
of
reluctance
of
course
the
healthy
approved
way
to
get
over
social
trauma
once
every
eighty
days
shut
it
off
kit
kit
please
the
telio
blared
in
a
cheaply
feminine
voice
oh
it
a
long
way
to
nowhere
forever
and
your
honey
not
coming
back
never
never
never
a
wailing
trumpet
represented

they
exploit
anything
kit
it
just
a
song
turn
it
off

christopher
temple
turned
off
the
telio
smiling
they
announce
the
names
in
ten
minutes
he
said
and
felt
the
corners
of
his
mouth
draw
taut
tell
me
again
kit
stephanie
pleaded
how
old
are
you
you
know
i
yes
so
if
they
do
call
you
this
time
you
be
safe
safe
i
can
hardly
believe
it
nine
minutes
said
temple
in
the
darkness
stephanie
had
drawn
the
blinds
earlier
had
dialed
for
the
screaming
in
the
streets
came
to
them
as
not
the
faintest
whisper
but
the
song
which
became
briefly
masochistically
popular
every
two
years
and
two
months
had
spoiled
their
feeling
of
seclusion
tell
me
again
kit
what
you
know
what
he
let
her
come
to
him
let
her
hug
him
fiercely
and
whimper
against
his
chest
he
remained
passive
although
it
hurt
occasionally
stroking
her
hair
he
could
not
assert
himself
for
another
he
looked
at
his
strap
chrono
for
another
eight
minutes
he
might
regret
it
if
he
did
for
a
lifetime
tell
me
kit
i
marry
you
steffy
in
eight
minutes
less
than
eight
minutes
i
go
down
and
get
the
license
we
marry
as
soon
as
it
legal
this
is
the
last
time
they
have
a
chance
for
you
i
mean
they
change
the
law
temple
shook
his
head
they
do
have
to
they
meet
their
quota
this
way
i
scared
you
and
everyone
else
in
north
america
steffy
she
was
trembling
against
him
it
cold
for
june
it
warm
in
here
he
kissed
her
moist
eyes
her
nose
her
lips
oh
god
kit
five
minutes
five
minutes
to
freedom
he
said
jauntily
he
did
not
feel
that
way
at
all
apprehension
clutched
at
his
chest
with
tight
painful
fingers
almost
making
it
difficult
for
him
to
breathe
turn
it
on
kit
he
dialed
the
telio
in
time
to
see
the
announcer
insincere
smile
smile
seventeen
kit
thought
wryly
patriotic
sacrifice
every
eighty
days
said
the
announcer
of
center
city
young
men
are
selected
to
serve
their
country
for
an
indeterminate
period
regulated
rigidly
by
a
rotation
system
liar
stephanie
cried
no
one
ever
comes
back
it
been
thirty
years
since
the
first
group
and
not
one
of
them
shh
temple
raised
a
finger
to
his
lips
this
is
the
thirteenth
call
since
the
inception
of
what
is
popularly
referred
to
as
the
nowhere
journey
said
the
announcer
obviously
the
two
hundred
young
men
from
center
city
and
the
thousands
from
all
over
this
hemisphere
do
not
in
reality
embark
on
a
journey
to
nowhere
that
is
quite
meaningless
hooray
for
him
temple
laughed
i
wish
he
get
on
with
it
no
ladies
and
gentlemen
we
use
the
word
nowhere
merely
because
we
are
not
aware
of
the
ultimate
destination
security
reasons
make
it
impossible
to
yes
yes
said
stephanie
impatiently
go
on
therefore
the
nowhere
journey
with
a
maximum
security
lid
on
the
whole
project
we
do
even
know
why
our
men
are
sent
or
by
what
means
we
know
only
that
they
go
somewhere
and
not
nowhere
bravely
and
not
fearfully
for
a
purpose
vital
to
the
security
of
this
nation
and
not
to
slake
the
thirst
of
a
chessman
of
regiments
and
divisions
if
center
city
contribution
helps
keep
our
country
strong
center
city
is
naturally
obligated
no
one
ever
said
it
is
our
duty
stephanie
argued
as
if
the
announcer
could
indeed
hear
her
we
only
wish
we
knew
something
about
it
and
we
wish
it
were
forever
it
is
forever
temple
reminded
her
not
officially
officially
my
foot
if
they
never
return
they
never
return
if
there
a
rotation
system
on
paper
but
it
never
used
that
not
a
rotation
system
at
all
kit
it
forever
to
thank
the
following
sponsors
for
relinquishing
their
time
no
one
would
want
to
sponsor
temple
whispered
cheerfully
kit
said
stephanie
i
i
suddenly
have
a
hunch
we
have
nothing
to
worry
about
they
missed
you
all
along
and
they
miss
you
this
time
too
the
last
time
and
then
you
be
too
old
that
funny
too
old
at
but
we
be
free
kit
free
he
starting
temple
told
her
a
large
drum
filled
the
entire
telio

rotated
slowly
from

temple
christopher
sorry
i
late
mr
jones
hardly
smith
hardly
three
minutes
late
i
come
in
response
to
your
ad
i
know
you
look
old
i
am
over
do
you
mind
not
if
you
do
smith
let
me
look
at
you
umm
you
seem
the
right
height
the
right
build
i
meet
the
specifications
exactly
good
smith
and
your
price
no
haggling
said
smith
i
have
a
price
which
must
be
met
your
price
mr
smith
ten
million
dollars
the
man
called
jones
coughed
nervously
that
high
very
take
it
or
leave
it
in
cash
definitely
small
unmarked
bills
you
need
a
moving
van
then
i
get
one
ten
million
dollars
said
jones
is
quite
a
price
admittedly
i
have
dealt
in
this
sort
of
traffic
before
but
but
nothing
were
your
name
jones
really
and
truly
jones
i
might
ask
less
sir
you
are
jones
exactly
as
much
as
i
am
smith
sir
jones
gasped
again
smith
coughed
discreetly
but
i
have
one
advantage
i
know
you
you
do
know
me
mr
arkalion
eh
eh
arkalion
the
north
american
carpet
king
right
how
did
you
know
the
man
whose
name
was
not
jones
but
arkalion
asked
the
man
whose
name
was
not
smith
but
might
as
well
have
been
when
i
saw
your
ad
said
i
said
to
myself
here
must
be
a
very
rich
influential
man
it
only
remained
for
me
to
study
a
series
of
photographs
readily
obtainable
i
have
a
fine
memory
for
that
arkalion
and
here
you
are
here
is
arkalion
the
carpet
king
what
will
you
do
with
the
ten
million
dollars
demanded
arkalion
not
minding
the
loss
nearly
so
much
as
the
ultimate
disposition
of
his
fortune
why
what
does
anyone
do
with
ten
million
dollars
treasure
it
invest
it
spend
it
i
mean
what
will
you
do
with
it
if
you
are
going
in
place
of
my
arkalion
bit
his
tongue
your
son
were
you
saying
arkalion
alaric
arkalion
the
third
did
you
know
that
i
was
able
to
boil
my
list
of
men
down
to
thirty
when
i
studied
their
family
ties
brilliant
smith
alaric
is
so
young
are
they
all
to
who
was
it
who
once
said
something
about
the
flower
of
our
young
manhood
shakespeare
said
arkalion
realizing
that
most
quotes
of
lasting
importance
came
from
the
bard
sophocles
said
smith
but
no
matter
i
will
take
young
place
for
ten
million
dollars
motives
always
troubled
arkalion
and
thus
he
pursued
what
might
have
been
a
dangerous
conversation
you
never
get
a
chance
to
spend
it
on
the
nowhere
journey
let
me
worry
about
that
no
one
ever
returns
my
worry
not
yours
it
is
forever
as
if
you
dropped
out
of
existence
alaric
is
so
young
i
have
always
gambled
arkalion
if
i
do
not
return
in
five
years
you
are
to
put
the
money
in
a
trust
fund
for
certain
designated
individuals
said
fund
to
be
terminated
the
moment
i
return
if
i
come
back
within
the
five
years
you
are
merely
to
give
the
money
over
to
me
is
that
clear
yes
i
want
it
in
writing
of
course
of
course
a
plastic
surgeon
is
due
here
in
about
ten
minutes
smith
and
we
can
get
on
with
but
if
i
do
know
your
name
how
can
i
put
it
in
writing
smith
smiled
i
changed
my
name
to
smith
for
the
occasion
perfectly
legal
my
name
is
john
x
smith
now
that
where
you
wrong
said
arkalion
as
the
plastic
surgeon
entered
your
name
is
alaric
arkalion
iii
the
plastic
surgeon
skittered
around
smith
examining
him
minutely
with
the
casual
expertness
that
comes
with
experience
have
to
shorten
the
cheek
bones
for
ten
million
dollars
said
smith
you
can
take
the
damned
things
out
altogether
and
hang
them
on
your
wall
sophia
androvna
petrovitch
made
her
way
downtown
through
the
bustle
of
tired
workers
and
the
occasional
sprinkling
of
comrades
she
crushed
her
cigarette
underfoot
at
number
stalin
avenue
paused
for
the
space
of
five
heartbeats
at
the
door
went
inside
what
do
you
want
the
man
at
the
desk
was
myopic
but
sophia
showed
her
party
card
oh
comrade
still
you
are
a
woman
you
terribly
observant
comrade
said
sophia
coldly
i
am
here
to
volunteer
but
a
woman
there
is
nothing
in
the
law
which
says
a
woman
can
not
volunteer
we
do
make
women
volunteer
i
mean
really
volunteer
of
her
own
free
will
her
own
free
will
the
man
removed
his
spectacles
scratched
his
balding
head
with
the
you
mean
volunteer
without
without
coercion
i
want
to
volunteer
i
am
here
to
volunteer
i
want
to
sign
on
for
the
next
stalintrek
stalintrek
a
woman
that
is
what
i
said
we
do
force
women
to
volunteer
the
man
scratched
some
more
oh
really
said
sophia
this
is
not
comrade
did
not
stalin
say
was
created
to
share
the
glorious
destiny
of
mother
russia
with
her
mate
sophia
created
the
quote
randomly
yes
if
stalin
said
he
did
still
i
do
not
recall
what
sophia
cried
stalin
dead
these
years
and
you
do
recall
his
speeches
what
is
your
name
comrade
please
comrade
now
that
you
remind
me
i
remember
what
is
your
name
here
i
will
give
you
the
volunteer
papers
to
sign
if
you
pass
the
exams
you
will
embark
on
the
next
stalintrek
though
why
a
beautiful
young
woman
like
you
shut
your
mouth
and
hand
me
those
papers
there
sitting
behind
that
desk
was
precisely
why
why
should
she
sophia
androvna
petrovitch
wish
to
volunteer
for
the
stalintrek
better
to
ask
why
a
bird
flies
south
in
the
winter
one
day
ahead
of
the
first
icy
gale
or
why
a
lemming
plunges
recklessly
into
the
sea
with
his
multitudes
of
fellows
if
indeed
the
venture
were
to
turn
out
grimly
but
there
behind
that
desk
was
part
of
the
reason
the
comrade
the
bright
sharp
comrade
with
his
depth
of
reasoning
his
fountain
of
gushing
emotions
his
worldliness
it
was
as
if
she
had
been
in
a
cocoon
all
her
life
stifled
starved
the
cottony
inner
lining
choking
her
whenever
she
opened
her
mouth
the
leathery
outer
covering
restricting
her
when
she
tried
to
move
no
one
had
ever
returned
from
the
stalintrek
she
then
had
to
assume
no
one
would
including
sophia
androvna
petrovitch
but
then
there
was
nothing
she
would
miss
nothing
to
which
she
particularly
wanted
to
return
not
the
stark
foul
streets
of
stalingrad
not
the
workers
with
their
vapid
faces
or
the
comrades
with
their
cautious
sweating
trembling
fearful
not
the
higher
echelon
of
comrades
more
frightened
but
showing
it
less
who
would
love
the
beauty
of
her
breasts
and
loins
but
not
herself
for
you
never
love
anything
but
the
stalinimage
and
mother
russia
herself
not
those
terrified
who
would
love
the
parts
of
her
if
she
permitted
but
not
her
or
any
other
person
for
that
matter
wrong
with
the
stalintrek
was
its
name
alone
a
name
one
associated
with
everything
else
in
russia
for
an
obvious
reason
but
everything
else
about
the
stalintrek
shrieked
mystery
and
adventure
where
did
you
go
how
did
you
get
there
what
did
you
do
why
a
million
questions
which
had
kept
her
awake
at
night
and
if
she
thought
about
them
hard
enough
satisfied
her
deep
longing
for
something
different
and
then
one
day
when
stolid
had
said
it
is
a
joke
a
terrible
terrible
joke
they
are
taking
my
husband
fyodor
on
the
stalintrek
when
he
lacks
sufficient
imagination
to
go
from
here
to
leningrad
or
even
tula
can
you
picture
fyodor
on
the
stalintrek
better
they
should
have
taken
me
better
they
should
have
taken
his
wife
that
day
sophia
could
hardly
contain
herself
as
a
party
member
she
had
access
to
the
law
and
she
read
it
three
times
from
start
to
finish
in
her
dingy
flat
by
the
light
of
a
smoking
candle
but
could
find
nothing
barring
women
from
the
stalintrek
had
fyodor
rasnikov
volunteered
naturally
everyone
volunteered
although
when
your
name
was
called
you
had
no
choice
there
had
been
no
draft
in
russia
since
the
days
of
the
second
war
of
the
liberation
volunteer
what
precisely
did
the
word
mean
she
sophia
androvna
petrovitch
would
volunteer
without
being
told
thus
it
was
she
found
herself
at
stalin
avenue
and
thus
the
balding
myopic
comrade
thrust
the
papers
across
his
desk
at
her
she
signed
her
name
with
such
vehemence
and
ferocity
that
she
almost
tore
through
the
paper
chapter
ii
men
sit
in
the
crowded
room
some

beer
some

in

some

in

fashion
about

urgent
at
the

try
to
fight
it
fourth
man
newly
named
alaric
arkalion
iii
i
look
forward
to
this
as
a
stimulating
adventure
does
the
fact
that
they
select
men
for
the
nowhere
journey
once
every
seven
hundred
and
eighty
days
strike
anyone
as
significant
second
man

got
my
own
problems
alaric

is
not
a
thalamic
problem
young
man
not
thalamic

third

to
the
plastic
surgeon
he
is
the
youngest
looking
of
all
with
red
cheeks
and
peachfuzz
whiskers
it
is
a
problem
of
the
intellect
why
seven
hundred
and
eighty
days
first

read
the
magazine
too
chief

think
we
all
going

earth
find
themselves
in
the
same
orbital
position
with
respect
to
the
sun
in
other
words
mars
and
earth
are
closest
then
were
there
such
a
thing
as
space
travel
new
costly
not
thoroughly
tested
they
would
want
to
make
each
journey
as
brief
as
possible
hence
the
seven
hundred
and
eighty
days
first
man
not
bad
chief

most
of
it

for
hours
through
the
fresh
country
air
feeling
the
wind
against
their
faces
listening

the
roar
their
made
all
alone
on
the
rimrock
highway

if
they

i
had
to
see
you
this
once
i
temple
smiled
he
had
absented
himself
without
leave
it
had
been
difficult
enough
and
he
might
yet
be
in
a
lot
of
hot
water
but
it
would
be
senseless
to
worry
stephanie
it
just
for
a
few
hours
he
said
hours
when
we
want
a
whole
lifetime
kit
oh
kit
why
do
we
run
away
just
the
two
of
us
someplace
where
they
never
find
you
i
could
be
packed
and
ready
and
do
talk
like
that
we
ca
you
want
to
go
where
they
sending
you
you
want
to
go
for
god
sake

like
that
i
do
want
to
go
anyplace
except
with
you
but
we
ca
run
away
steffy
i
got
to
face
it
whatever
it
is
no
you
do
it
noble
to
be
patriotic
sure
it
always
was
but
this
is
different
kit
they
do
ask
for
part
of
your
life
not
for
two
years
or
three
or
a
gamble
because
maybe
you
wo
ever
come
back
they
ask
for
all
of
you
for
the
rest
of
your
life
forever
and
they
do
even
tell
you
why
kit
do
go
we
hide
someplace
and
get
married
and
and
nothing
temple
stopped
the
climbed
out
opened
the
door
for
stephanie
do
you
see
there
no
place
to
hide
wherever
you
go
they
look
you
would
want
to
spend
the
rest
of
your
life
running
steffy
not
with
me
or
anyone
else
i
would
i
would
know
what
would
happen
after
a
few
years
we
hate
each
other
look
at
me
and
say
would
be
hiding
like
this
except
for
you
young
and
kit
that
cruel
i
would
not
yes
you
would
steffy
i
a
lump
rose
in
his
throat
he
tell
her
goodbye
permanently
he
had
to
do
it
that
way
did
not
want
her
to
wait
endlessly
and
hopelessly
for
a
return
that
would
not
materialize
i
did
get
permission
to
leave
steffy
he
had
meant
to
tell
her
that
but
suddenly
it
seemed
an
easy
way
to
break
into
goodbye
what
do
you
mean
no
you
did
i
had
to
see
you
what
can
they
do
send
me
for
longer
than
forever
then
you
do
want
to
run
away
with
me
steffy
no
when
i
leave
you
tonight
steffy
it
for
good
it
the
last
of
kit
temple
stop
thinking
about
me

never
was
it
sounded
ridiculous
even
to
him
kit
i
love
you
i
love
you
how
can
i
forget
you
it
happened
before
it
will
happen
again
that
hurt
too
he
was
talking
about
a
couple
of
statistics
not
about
himself
and
stephanie
we
different
kit
i
love
you
forever
and
kit
i
know
you
come
back
to
me
i
wait
kit
we
different

come
back
how
many
people
do
you
think
said
before
you
do
want
to
come
back
even
if
you
could
you
not
thinking
of
us
at
all
you
thinking
of
your
brother
you
know
that
is
true
sometimes
i
wonder
about
jase
sure
but
if
i
thought
there
was
a
chance
to
return
i
a
selfish
cuss
steffy
if
i
thought
there
was
a
chance
you
know
i
want
you
all
for
myself
brand
you
and
that
the
truth
you
do
love
me
i
loved
you
steffy
kit
temple
loved
you
loved
loved
past
tense
when
i
leave
tonight
it
as
if
i
do
exist
anymore
as
if
i
never
existed
it
got
to
be
that
way
steffy
in
thirty
years
no
one
ever
returned
including
your
brother
jase
so
now
you
want
to
find
him
what
do
i
count
for
what
this
going
was
my
idea
i
wanted
to
stay
with
you
i
wanted
to
marry
you
i
ca
now
none
of
it
forget
me
steffy
forget
you
ever
knew
me
jase
said
that
to
our
folks
before
he
was
taken
almost
five
years
before
jason
temple
had
been
selected
for
the
nowhere
journey
he
been
young
though
older
than
his
brother
kit
young
unattached
almost
cheerful
he
was
naturally
they
never
saw
him
again
hold
me
kit
i
sorry
carrying
on
like
this
they
had
walked
some
distance
from
the
through
scrub
oak
and
bramble
bushes
they
found
a
clearing
still
from
last
autumn
melodic
with
the
chirping
of
nameless
birds
they
sat
not
talking
stephanie
wore
a
gay
summer
dress
cut
deep
beneath
the
throat
she
swayed
toward
him
from
the
waist
nestled
her
head
on
his
shoulder
he
could
smell
the
soft
sweet
fragrance
of
her
hair
of
the
skin
at
the
nape
of
her
neck
if
you
want
to
say
goodbye
she
said
stop
it
he
told
her
if
you
want
to
say
goodbye
her
head
rolled
against
his
chest
she
turned
cradled
herself
in
his
arms
smiled
up
at
him
squirmed
some
more
and
had
her
head
pillowed
on
his
lap
she
smiled
tremulously
her
lips
parted
he
bent
and
kissed
her
knowing
it
was
all
wrong
this
was
not
goodbye
not
the
way
he
wanted
it
quickly
definitely
for
once
and
all
with
a
tear
perhaps
a
lot
of
tears
but
permanent
goodbye
this
was
all
wrong
the
whole
idea
was
to
be
objective
it
had
to
be
done
that
way
or
no
way
at
all
briefly
he
regretted
leaving
the
encampment
this
was
goodbye
the
way
he
wanted
it
the
way
it
had
to
be
this
was
and
then
he
forgot
everything
but
stephanie
i
am
alaric
arkalion
iii
said
the
extremely
man
with
the
old
wise
eyes
how
incongruous
temple
thought
the
eyes
look
almost
the
rest
of
him
a
boy
something
tells
me
we
be
seeing
a
lot
of
each
other
arkalion
went
on
the
voice
was
that
of
an
older
man
too
belying
the
youthful
complexion
the
almost
childish
features
the
soft
fuzz
of
a
beard
i
kit
temple
said
temple
extending
his
hand
arkalion
a
strange
name
i
know
it
from
somewhere
say
are
you
do
you
have
something
to
do
with
carpets
or
something
here
and
now
no
i
am
a
number
but
my
father
is
perhaps
i
had
better
say
was
my
father
is
alaric
arkalion
ii
yes
that
is
right
the
carpet
king
i
be
darned
said
temple
why
well
temple
laughed
i
never
met
a
billionaire
before
here
i
am
not
a
billionaire
nor
will
i
ever
be
one
again
a
number
on
his
way
to
mars
with
a
bunch
of
other
numbers
mars
you
sound
sure
of
yourself
reasonably
ah
it
is
a
pleasure
to
talk
with
a
gentleman
i
am
reasonably
certain
it
will
be
mars
temple
nodded
in
agreement
that
what
the
sunday
supplements
say
all
right
and
doubtless
you
have
observed
no
one
denies
it
but
what
on
earth
do
we
want
on
mars
that
in
itself
is
a
contradiction
laughed
arkalion
we
find
out
though
temple
they
had
reached
the
head
of
the
line
found
themselves
entering
a
huge
they
found
two
seats
together
followed
the
instructions
printed
at
the
head
of
the
aisle
by
strapping
themselves
in
and
not
smoking
talking
all
around
them
was
subdued
contrariness
has
given
way
to
fear
arkalion
observed
you
should
have
seen
them
the
last
few
days
waiting
around
the
induction
center
a
chip
on
each
shoulder
say
where
you
i
what
do
you
mean
i
did
see
you
until
last
evening
suddenly
you
were
here
did
anyone
else
miss
me
but
i
remember
you
the
first
day
did
anyone
else
miss
me
any
of
the
officials
no
not
that
i
know
of
then
i
was
here
temple
said
very
seriously
arkalion
smiled
by
george
of
course
then
you
were
here
temple
we
get
along
fine
temple
said
that
was
swell
anyway
we
better
forever
is
a
long
time
three
minutes
later
the
jet
took
off
and
soared
on
eager
wings
toward
the
setting
sun
men
since
we
are
leaving
here
in
a
few
hours
and
since
there
is
no
way
to
get
out
of
the
encampment
and
no
place
to
go
over
the
desert
even
if
you
could
the
microphone
in
the
great
empty
hall
boomed
as
the
two
files
of
men
marched
in
there
is
no
harm
in
telling
you
where
you
are
from
this
point
in
a
limited
sense
you
shall
be
kept
abreast
of
your
progress
we
are
in
white
sands
new
mexico
the
garden
spot
of
the
universe
someone
shouted
derisively
remembering
the
bleak
hot
desert
and
jagged
mountain
peaks
as
they
came
down
white
sands
muttered
arkalion
it
looks
like
space
travel
now
does
it
kit
temple
shrugged
why
white
sands
was
the
center
of
experiments
in
rocketry
decades
ago
when
people
still
talked
about
those
things
then
for
a
long
time
no
one
heard
anything
about
white
sands
the
rockets
grew
here
kit
i
can
readily
see
why
you
could
look
all
your
life
without
finding
a
barren
spot
like
this
precisely
someone
once
called
this
place
or
was
it
some
other
place
like
it
someone
once
called
it
a
good
place
to
throw
old
razor
blades
if
people
still
used
razor
blades
the
microphone
blared
again
after
the
several
hundred
men
had
entered
the
great
hall
and
milled
about
among
the
echoes
temple
could
picture
other
halls
like
this
other
briefings
men
whenever
you
are
given
instructions
in
here
or
elsewhere
obey
them
instantly
our
job
is
a
big
one
complicated
and
exacting
attention
to
detail
will
save
us
trouble
someone
said
my
old
man
served
a
hitch
in
the
army
back
in
the
sixties
that
what
he
always
said
attention
to
details
the
army
is
crazy
about
things
like
that
are
we
in
the
army
or
something
this
is
not
the
army
but
the
function
is
similar
barked
the
microphone
do
as
you
are
told
and
you
will
get
along
stirrings
in
the
crowd
mutterings
temple
gaped
microphone
yes
but
receivers
also
placed
strategically
all
around
the
hall
to
pick
up
sound
telio
receivers
too
perhaps
it
made
him
feel
something
like
a
goldfish
apparently
someone
liked
the
idea
of
the
microphones
i
got
a
question
when
are
we
coming
back
laughter
hooting
catcalls
blared
the

there
is
a
rotation
system
in
operation
men
when
it
is
feasible
men
will
be
rotated
yeah
in
thirty
years
it
ai
been
whatsiz
feasible
once
that
unfortunately
is
correct
when
the
situation
permits
we
will
rotate
you
home
from
where
where
are
we
going
at
least
tell
us
that
where
how
about
that
there
was
a
pause
then
the
microphone
barked
i
do
know
the
answer
to
that
question
you
wo
believe
me
but
it
is
the
truth
no
one
knows
where
you
are
going
no
one
except
the
people
who
are
already
there
more
catcalls
that
does
make
sense
arkalion
whispered
if
it
space
travel
the
pilots
would
know
would
they
automatic
temple
suggested
i
doubt
it
space
travel
must
still
be
new
even
if
it
has
thirty
years
under
its
belt
if
that
man
speaks
the
truth
if
no
one
knows
just
where

and
he
spins
like
a
top
with
arms
and
legs
top
of
the
morning
to
you
charlie
i
said
top
of
the
someone
stop
me
i
getting
dizzy
they
floated
tumbled
spun
around
the
spaceship
lounge
room
in
simple
childish
glee
they
cavorted
in
festive
weightlessness
they
happy
now
arkalion
observed
the
novelty
of
free
fall
of
weighing
exactly
nothing
strikes
them
as
amusing
i
think
i
getting
the
hang
of
it
said
temple
clumsily
he
made
a
few
tentative
swimming
motions
in
the
air
propelling
himself
forward
a
few
yards
before
he
lost
his
balance
and
tumbled
head
over
heels
against
the
wall
arkalion
came
to
him
quickly
in
a
combination
of
swimming
and
pushing
with
hands
and
feet
against
the
wall
arkalion
righted
him
expertly
sat
down
gingerly
beside
him
if
you
keep
sudden
motions
to
a
minimum
you
get
along
fine
more
than
anything
else
that
the
secret
of
it
temple
nodded
it
sort
of
like
the
first
time
you
on
ice
skates
say
how
come
you
so
good
at
it
i
used
to
read
the
old
theoretical
books
on
the
words
poured
out
effortlessly
smoothly
i
merely
applying
the
theories
put
forward
as
early
as
the
oh
but
it
left
temple
with
some
food
for
thought
alaric
arkalion
was
a
queer
duck
anyway
and
of
all
the
men
gathered
in
the
spaceship
lounge
he
alone
had
mastered
weightlessness
with
hardly
any
trouble
take
your
ice
skates
arkalion
went
on
some
people
put
them
on
and
use
them
like
natural
extensions
of
their
feet
the
first
time
others
fall
all
over
themselves
i
suppose
i
am
lucky
sure
said
temple
actually
the
only
thing
odd
about
arkalion
was
his
face
and
perhaps
his
propensity
for
coming
up
with
the
right
answers
at
the
right
times
arkalion
had
seemed
so
certain
of
he
hardly
batted
an
eyelash
when
they
boarded
a
long
tapering
ship
at
white
sands
and
thundered
off
into
the
sky
he
took
for
granted
the
to
a
huge
round
ship
at
the
station
in
space
moments
after
leaving
the
space
station
with
a
minimum
of
stress
and
strain
thanks
to
the
gravity
it
was
arkalion
who
first
swam
through
air
to
the
viewport
and
pointed
out
the
huge
crescent
earth
green
and
gray
and
brown
sparkling
with
patches
of
dazzling
you
will
observe
it
is
a
crescent
arkalion
had
said
it
is
closer
to
the
sun
than
we
are
and
off
at
an
angle
as
i
suspected
our
destination
is
mars
then
everyone
was
saying
goodbye
to
earth
fantastic
it
seemed
there
were
tears
there
was
laughter
cursing
promises
of
return
awkward
verbal
comparisons
with
the
crescent
moon
vows
of
faithfulness
to
lovers
and
sweethearts
and
there
was
arkalion
with
an
avid
expression
in
the
old
eyes
arkalion
with
his
boyish
face
not
saying
goodbye
so
much
as
he
was
calling
hello
to
something
temple
could
not
fathom
now
as
he
struggled
awkwardly
with
weightlessness
temple
called
it
his
imagination
his
shifted
vaguely
without
motivation
from
the
gleaming
polished
interior
of
the
ship
with
its
smell
of
antiseptic
and
metal
polish
to
the
clear
spring
air
of
earth
blue
of
sky
and
bright
of
sun
the
unique
blue
sky
of
earth
which
he
somehow
knew
could
not
be
duplicated
elsewhere
elsewhere
the
word
itself
bordered
on
the
meaningless
and
stephanie
the
brief
warm
ecstasy
of
her
once
forever
he
wondered
with
surprising
objectivity
if
a
hundred
other
names
a
hundred
other
women
were
not
in
a
hundred
other
minds
while
everyone
stared
at
the
crescent
earth
hanging
serenely
in
space
with
each
name
and
each
woman
as
dear
as
stephanie
with
the
same
combination
of
fire
and
gentle
femininity
stirring
the
blood
but
saddening
the
heart
would
stephanie
really
forget
him
did
he
want
her
to
that
part
of
him
burned
by
the
fire
of
her
said
no
no
she
must
not
forget
him
she
was
his
his
alone
roped
and
branded
though
a
universe
separated
them
but
someplace
in
his
heart
was
the
thought
the
understanding
the
realization
that
although
stephanie
might
keep
a
small
place
for
him
tucked
someplace
deep
in
her
emotions
she
must
forget
he
was
gone
permanently
for
stephanie
he
was
dead
it
was
as
he
had
told
her
that
last
stolen
day
it
was
stephanie
how
much
i
love
struggling
with
weightlessness
he
made
his
way
back
to
the
small
room
he
shared
with
arkalion
hardly
more
than
a
cubicle
it
was
with
sufficient
room
for
two
beds
a
sink
a
small
chest
he
lay
down
and
slept
murmuring
stephanie
name
in
his
sleep
he
awoke
to
the
faint
hum
of
the
got
up
feeling
rested
forgot
his
weightlessness
and
floated
to
the
ceiling
where
only
an
outthrust
arm
prevented
a
nasty
bump
on
his
head
he
used
hand
grips
on
the
wall
to
let
himself
down
he
washed
aware
of
no
way
to
prevent
the
water
he
splashed
on
his
face
from
forming
fine
droplets
and
spraying
the
entire
room
when
he
crossed
back
to
the
foot
of
his
bed
to
get
his
towel
he
thrust
one
foot
out
too
rapidly
lost
his
balance
stumbled
and
fell
against
the
other
bed
which
like
all
other
items
of
furniture
was
fastened
to
the
floor
but
his
elbow
struck
sleeping
arkalion
jaw
sharply
hard
enough
to
jar
the
man
teeth
i
sorry
said
temple
did
mean
to
do
that
he
apologized
again
feeling
embarrassed
arkalion
merely
lay
there
i
said
i
sorry
arkalion
still
slept
it
seemed
inconceivable
for
temple
elbow
pained
him
considerably
he
bent
down
examined
his
inert
companion
arkalion
stirred
not
a
muscle
vaguely
alarmed
temple
thrust
a
hand
to
arkalion
chest
felt
nothing
he
crouched
rested
the
side
of
his
head
over
heart
he
listened
heard
nothing
what
was
going
on
here
hey
arkalion
temple
shook
him
gently
at
first
then
with
savage
force
weightless
arkalion
body
floated
up
off
the
bed
taking
the
covers
with
it
his
own
heart
pounding
furiously
temple
got
it
down
again
fingered
the
left
wrist
and
swallowed
nervously
temple
had
never
seen
a
dead
man
before
arkalion
heart
did
not
beat
arkalion
had
no
pulse
arkalion
was
dead
yelling
hoarsely
temple
plunged
from
the
room
soaring
off
the
floor
in
his
haste
and
striking
his
head
against
the
ceiling
hard
enough
to
make
him
see
stars
this
guy
is
dead
he
cried
arkalion
is
dead
men
stirred
in
the
companionway
someone
called
for
one
of
the
armed
guards
who
were
constantly
on
patrol
if
he
dead
you
yelling
loud
enough
to
get
him
out
of
his
grave
the
voice
was
quiet
amused
arkalion
what
temple
blurted
whirling
around
and
striking
his
head
again
a
little
he
the
room
now
who
is
dead
kit
demanded
arkalion
sitting
up
and
stretching
comfortably
who
is
dead
who
temple
stared
a
guard
completely
at
home
with
weightlessness
entered
the
cubicle
briskly
what
the
trouble
in
here
something
about
a
dead
man
they
said
a
dead
man
demanded
arkalion
indeed
dead
muttered
temple
lamely
and
foolishly
dead
arkalion
smiled
deprecatingly
my
friend
must
have
been
talking
in
his
sleep
the
only
thing
dead
in
here
is
my
appetite
weightlessness
does
let
you
become
very
hungry
you
grow
used
to
it
the
guard
promised
he
patted
his
paunch
happily
i
am
well
do
raise
the
alarm
unless
there
some
trouble
remember
about
the
boy
who
cried
wolf
of
course
said
temple
sure
sorry
he
watched
the
guard
depart
bad
dream
arkalion
wanted
to
know
bad
dream
my
foot
i
accidentally
hit
you
hard
enough
to
hurt
you
did
move
i
a
sound
sleeper
i
felt
for
your
heart
it
was
beating
it
was
oh
come
come
your
heart
was
not
beating
i
said
and
i
suppose
i
was
cold
as
a
slab
of
ice
umm
no
i
do
remember
maybe
you
were
you
had
no
pulse
either
arkalion
laughed
easily
and
am
i
still
dead
well
clearly
a
case
of
overwrought
nerves
and
a
highly
keyed
imagination
what
you
need
is
some
more
sleep
i
not
sleepy
thanks
well
i
think
i
get
up
and
go
down
for
breakfast
arkalion
climbed
out
of
bed
gingerly
made
his
way
to
the
sink
and
was
soon
gargling
with
a
bottle
of
prepared
mouthwash
occasionally
spraying
weightless
droplets
of
the
pink
liquid
up
at
the
ceiling
temple
lit
a
cigarette
with
shaking
fingers
made
his
way
to
bed
while
the
man
hummed
tunelessly
at
the
sink
temple
let
his
hands
fall
on
the
sheet
it
was
not
cold
but
comfortably
cool
hardly
as
warm
as
it
should
have
been
with
a
man
sleeping
on
it
all
night
was
he
still
imagining
things
i
glad
you
did
call
for
a
burial
detail
and
have
me
expelled
into
space
with
yesterday
garbage
arkalion
called
over
his
shoulder
jauntily
as
he
went
outside
for
some
breakfast
temple
cursed
softly
and
lit
another
cigarette
dropping
the
first
one
into
a
disposal
chute
on
the
wall
every
night
thereafter
temple
made
it
a
point
to
remain
awake
after
arkalion
apparently
had
fallen
asleep
but
if
he
were
seeking
repetition
of
the
peculiar
occurrence
he
was
disappointed
not
only
did
arkalion
sleep
soundly
and
through
the
night
but
he
snored
loudly
and
clearly
a
wheezing
snore
arkalion
strange
feat
or
his
own
overwrought
imagination
temple
thought
wryly
was
good
for
one
thing
it
took
his
mind
off
stephanie
the
days
wore
on
in
endless
monotonous
routine
he
took
some
books
from
the
ship
library
and
browsed
through
them
even
managing
to
find
one
concerned
with
traumatic
catalepsy
which
stated
that
a
severe
emotional
shock
might
render
one
into
a
deep
enough
trance
to
have
a
layman
mistakenly
pronounce
him
dead
but
what
had
been
the
severe
emotional
disturbance
for
arkalion
could
the
effects
of
weightlessness
manifest
themselves
in
that
way
in
rare
instances
temple
naturally
did
not
know
but
he
resolved
to
find
out
if
he
could
after
reaching
their
destination
one
day
it
was
three
weeks
after
they
left
the
space
station
temple
realized
they
were
all
called
to
assembly
in
the
ship
large
main
lounge
as
the
men
drifted
in
temple
was
amazed
to
see
the
progress
they
had
made
with
weightlessness
he
himself
had
advanced
to
handy
facility
in
locomotion
but
it
struck
him
all
the
more
pointedly
when
he
saw
two
hundred
men
swim
and
float
through
air
pushing
themselves
along
by
means
of
the
strategically
placed
along
the
walls
the
microphone
greeted
them
all
good
afternoon
men
good
afternoon
mac
hey
is
this
the
way
to
ebbetts
field
get
on
with
it
sounds
like
the
same
man
who
addressed
us
in
white
sands
temple
told
arkalion
he
sure
does
get
around
a
recording
probably
listen
our
destination
as
you
probably
read
in
newspapers
and
magazines
is
the
planet
mars
mutterings
in
the
assembly
not
many
of
surprise
their
suppositions
based
both
on
the
seven
hundred
eighty
day
lapse
between
nowhere
journeys
and
the
romantic
position
in
which
the
planet
mars
has
always
been
held
are
correct
we
are
going
to
mars
for
most
of
you
mars
will
be
a
permanent
home
for
many
years
to
come
most
of
us
temple
wondered
out
loud
arkalion
raised
a
finger
to
his
lips
for
until
such
time
as
you
are
rotated
according
to
the
policy
of
rotation
set
up
by
the
government
temple
had
grown
accustomed
to
the
familiar
hoots
and
catcalls
he
almost
had
an
urge
to
join
in
himself
interesting
arkalion
pointed
out
back
at
white
sands
they
claimed
not
to
know
our
destination
they
knew
it
all
right
up
to
a
point
the
planet
mars
but
now
they
say
that
all
of
us
will
not
remain
on
mars
most
interesting
further
indoctrination
in
our
mission
soon
after
our
arrival
on
the
red
planet
landing
will
be
performed
under
somewhat
less
strain
than
the
initial
takeoff
in
the
ferry
since
mars
exerts
less
of
a
gravity
pull
than
earth
on
the
other
hand
you
have
been
weightless
for
three
weeks
and
the
is
liable
to
make
some
of
you
sick
it
will
pass
harmlessly
enough
we
realize
it
is
difficult
being
taken
from
your
homes
without
knowing
the
nature
of
your
urgent
mission
all
i
can
tell
you
now
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
all
i
know
here
we
go
again
said
temple
more
riddles
is
that
everything
of
the
utmost
urgency
our
entire
way
of
life
is
at
stake
our
job
will
be
to
safeguard
it
in
the
months
which
follow
few
of
you
will
have
any
big
significant
role
to
play
but
all
of
you
working
together
will
provide
the
strength
we
need
when
the
so
they
call
their
guards
teachers
arkalion
commented
come
around
they
will
see
that
each
man
is
strapped
properly
into
his
bunk
for
deceleration
deceleration
begins
in
minutes
thought
temple
back
in
his
room
with
arkalion
he
did
not
think
of
stephanie
except
as
a
man
who
knows
he
must
spend
the
rest
of
his
life
in
prison
might
think
of
a
lush
green
field
or
the
cool
swish
of
skis
over
fresh
powdery
snow
or
the
sound
of
yardarms
creaking
against
the
wind
on
a
small
sailing
schooner
or
the
tang
of
wieners
roasting
over
an
open
fire
with
the
crisp
air
of
fall
against
your
back
or
the
scent
of
good
french
brandy
or
a
woman
deceleration
began
promptly
before
his
face
was
distorted
and
his
eyes
forced
shut
by
a
pressure
of
four
gravities
temple
had
time
to
see
the
look
of
complete
unconcern
on
arkalion
face
arkalion
in
fact
was
sleeping
he
seemed
as
completely
relaxed
as
he
did
that
morning

thought
he
was
dead

must
keep
some
of
my
own
clothing
she
told
him
impossible
i
have
my
orders
i
am
a
woman
you
are
a
volunteer
for
the
stalintrek
you
will
take
no
personal
property
no
clothing
with
you
strip
and
advance
please
sophia
flushed
slightly
while
the
men
behind
her
began
to
call
and
taunt
i
like
this
stalintrek
oh
yes
we
are
waiting
comrade
quickly
and
with
an
objective
detachment
which
surprised
her
sophia
unbuttoned
her
shirt
removed
it
her
one
wish
and
an
odd
one
she
thought
smiling
was
for
wax
for
her
ears
she
loosened
the
three
snaps
of
her
skirt
watched
it
fall
to
the
floor
she
stood
there
briefly
a
tall
slim
girl
then
had
the
white
shorts
over
her
nakedness
in
one
quick
motion
she
still
wore
a
coarse
halter
all
personal
effects
comrade
said
the
nervous
little
man
no
sophia
told
him
but
yes
definitely
yes
you
hold
up
the
line
and
we
have
a
schedule
to
maintain
the
stalintrek
demands
quick
prompt
obedience
then
you
will
give
me
one
additional
item
of
clothing
the
man
looked
at
sophia
halter
at
the
fine
way
she
filled
it
he
shrugged
we
do
have
it
he
said
clearly
enjoying
himself
in
volunteering
for
the
stalintrek
sophia
had
invaded
man
domain
she
had
watched
not
with
embarrassment
but
with
scorn
while
the
men
in
front
of
her
got
out
of
their
clothing
she
had
invaded
man
domain
and
as
she
watched
them
the
short
flabby
ones
the
bony
ones
with
protruding
ribs
and
those
of
milky
white
skin
and
soft
hands
she
knew
most
of
them
would
bite
off
more
than
they
could
chew
if
ever
they
tried
what
was
the
most
natural
thing
for
men
to
try
with
a
lone
woman
in
an
isolated
environment
but
she
in
a
man
world
now
and
if
that
was
the
way
they
wanted
it
she
would
ask
no
quarter
she
reached
up
quickly
with
one
hand
and
unfastened
the
halter
catching
it
with
her
free
hand
and
holding
it
in
front
of
her
breasts
while
the
nervous
little
man
licked
his
lips
and
gaped
sophia
grabbed
another
pair
of
the
white
shorts
tore
it
quickly
with
her
strong
fingers
fashioning
a
crude
covering
for
herself
this
she
pulled
around
her
fastening
it
securely
with
a
knot
in
back
you
have
to
give
that
back
to
me
declared
the
nervous
little
comrade
i
bet
you
a
samovar
on
that
sophia
said
quietly
so
only
the
man
heard
her
he
reached
out
as
if
to
rip
the
crude
halter
from
her
body
but
sophia
met
him
halfway
with
her
strong
slim
fingers
wrapping
them
around
his
biceps
and
squeezing
the
man
face
turned
quickly
to
white
as
he
tried
unsuccessfully
to
free
his
arm
please
that
hurts
i
keep
what
i
am
wearing
she
tightened
her
grip
but
gazed
serenely
into
space
as
the
man
stifled
a
whimper
well
the
man
whispered
indecisively
as
he
gritted
his
teeth
fool
said
sophia
your
arm
will
be
black
and
blue
for
a
week
while
you
men
grow
soft
and
lazy
many
of
the
women
take
their
gymnastics
seriously
especially
if
they
want
to
keep
their
figures
with
the
work
they
must
do
and
the
food
they
must
eat
i
am
stronger
than
you
and
i
will
hurt
you
unless
and
her
hand
tightened
around
his
scrawny
arm
until
her
knuckles
showed
white
wear
what
you
have
and
go
the
man
pleaded
and
moaned
softly
when
sophia
released
his
numb
arm
and
strode
through
the
portal
still
drawing
whistles
and
leers
from
the
other
men
who
missed
the
completely
so
we
on
mars
it
ai
nowhere
after
all

the
rusty
ochre
emptiness
spreading
out
toward
the
horizon
in
all
directions
spotted
occasionally
with
pale
green
and
frosty
white
the
sky
gray
with
but
a
shade
of
blue
in
it
distant
gusts
of
martian
wind
swirling
ochre
clouds
across
the
desert
the
spaceship
poised
on
its
ungainly
bottom
a
great
silver
bowling
ball
with
rocket
tubes
for
finger
holes
and
the
martians
from
earth
who
had
been
here
on
this
alien
world
for
days
or
twice

they
did
not
seem
to
mind
the
cold
these
temple
guessed
they
never
spent
much
time
out
of
doors
above
ground
for
there
were
no
buildings
because
all
seemed
pale
and
white
while
the
sun
was
weaker
so
was
the
protection
offered
by
a
thinner
atmosphere
the
sun
actinic
rays
could
burn
and
so
could
the
wind
but
pale
skins
could
not
be
the
result
of
staying
indoors
for
temple
noted
the
lack
of
structures
at
once
underground
then
the
lived
underground
like
moles
doing
what
and
for
what
reason
with
what
ultimate
goal
if
any
and
where
did
those
men
who
did
not
remain
on
mars
go
temple
head
whirled
with
countless
questions
and
no
answers
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
arkalion
he
made
his
way
down
the
gangplank
turning
up
the
collar
of
his
jumper
against
the
stinging
wind
you
got
any
newspapers
pal
magazines
phonograph
records
gossip
newsfilm
who
the
heavyweight
champ
we
lick
those
commies
in

yet
step
back
watch
that
man
maybe
he
your
replacement
replacement
that
good
all
types
of
men
all
ages
in
torn
tattered
clothing
mostly
in
rags
even
if
a
man
seemed
more
than
the
rest
on
closer
examination
temple
could
see
the
careful
stitching
the
patches
the
fades
and
stains
no
one
seemed
to
mind
hey
bud
what
do
you
hear
about
rotation
they
passed
any
laws
yet
i
been
here
ten
years
when
do
get
rotated
ai
that
something
dad
jenks
came
here
with
the
first
ship
you
talk
about
rotation
ask
dad
better
not
mention
that
word
to
dad
jenks
he
sees
red
this
whole
damn
planet
is
red
want
a
guided
tour
of
nowhere
men
step
right
up
arkalion
grinned
they
seem
so
he
said
then
shuddered
against
the
cold
and
followed
temple
with
the
others
through
the
crowd
they
were
inoculated
against
nameless
diseases
watch
for
the
needle
with
the
hook
they
were
told
again
they
had
arrived
on
the
planet
mars
no
kidding
led
to
a
drab
underground
city
dimly
lit
dank
noisome
with
mold
and
mildew
quick
the
chlorophyll
assigned
bunks
in
a
dormitory
with
four
men
to
a
room
be
it
ever
so
humble
bah
told
to
keep
things
clean
and
assigned
temporarily
to
a
garbage
pickup
detail
for
this
i
left
sheboygan
read
to
from
the
declaration
of
independence
the
constitution
and
public
law
concerned
with
the
nowhere
journey
it
told
them
nothing
they
did
not
already
know
given
as
complete
a
battery
of
tests
mental
emotional
and
physical
as
temple
ever
knew
existed
cripes
man
how
the
hell
should
i
know
what
the
cube
root
of
is
i
never
finished
high
school
subjected
to
an
exhaustive
overlong
and
at
times
meaningless
personal
interview
no
doc
honest
i
never
knew
i
had
a
uh
anxiety
neurosis
is
it
dangerous
how
do
you
do
temple
sit
down
thank
you
thought
you
like
to
know
that
while
your
overall
test
score
is
not
uncanny
it
decidedly
high
so
what
so
nothing
not
necessarily
except
that
with
it
you
have
a
very
well
balanced
personality
we
can
use
you
temple
that
why
i
here
i
mean
elsewhere
mars
is
only
a
way
station
a
training
center
for
a
select
few
it
takes
an
awful
lot
of
administrative
work
to
keep
this
place
going
which
explains
the
need
for
all
the
station
personnel
listen
the
last
few
weeks
i
had
everything
thrown
at
me
everything
the
works
mind
answering
one
question
shoot
what
this
all
about
temple
i
do
know
you
what
i
know
you
find
it
hard
to
believe
but
i
do
there
is
a
man
here
on
mars
who
knows
the
whole
story
either
and
certainly
not
on
earth
we
know
enough
to
keep
everything
in
operation
and
we
know
important
all
of
it
everything
we
do
you
mentioned
a
need
for
some
men
elsewhere
where
the
psychiatrist
shrugged
i
do
know
somewhere
anywhere
he
spread
his
hands
out
eloquently
that
where
the
nowhere
journey
comes
in
surely
you
can
tell
me
something
more
than
absolutely
not
it
is
that
i
do
want
to
i
ca
i
do
know
well
one
more
question
i
like
you
to
answer
the
psychiatrist
lit
a
cigarette
grinned
say
who
is
interviewing
whom
this
one
i
think
you
can
tackle
i
have
a
brother
jason
temple
embarked
on
the
nowhere
journey
five
years
ago
i
wonder
so
that
the
one
factor
in
your
psychograph
we
could
figure
out
anxiety
over
your
brother
i
doubt
it
shrugged
temple
more
likely
my
fiancee
umm
common
enough
you
were
to
be
married
yes
what
are
you
doing
now
right
now
that
what
hurts
the
most
well
yes
i
can
find
out
about
your
brother
the
psychiatrist
flicked
a
toggle
on
his
desk
jamison
find
what
you
can
on
temple
jason
year
of
temple
supplied
we
wait
after
a
moment
or
two
the
voice
came
through
faintly
metallic
temple
jason

physcom
good

others
shipped
out
so
jase
had
shipped
out
for
nowhere
someday
you
follow
in
your
brother
footsteps
temple
now
though
i
have
a
few
hundred
questions
i
like
you
to
answer
the
psychiatrist
had
exaggerated
several
hours
of
questioning
followed
once
reminded
of
her
temple
found
it
hard
to
keep
his
thought
off
stephanie
he
left
the
psychiatrist
office
more
confused
than
ever
good
morning
child
you
are
stephanie
andrews
stephanie
felt
up
to
working
that
first
morning
after
kit
final
goodbye
she
answered
the
door
in
her
bathrobe
saw
a
small
woman
with
graying
hair
and
a
kind
face
that
right
wo
you
come
in
thank
you
i
represent
the
complete
emancipation
league
miss
andrews
complete
emancipation
league
oh
something
to
do
with
politics
really
i
not
much
interested
in
that
entirely
the
trouble
declared
the
older
woman
too
many
of
us
are
not
interested
in
politics
i
like
to
discuss
the
with
you
my
dear
if
you
will
bear
with
me
a
few
minutes
all
right
said
stephanie
would
you
like
a
glass
of
sherry
in
the
morning
the
older
woman
smiled
i
sorry
do
mind
me
my
fiance
left
yesterday
took
his
final
goodbye
he
he
embarked
on
the
nowhere
journey
i
realize
that
it
is
precisely
why
i
am
here
my
dear
the
does
not
want
to
fight
the
government
if
the
government
decides
that
the
nowhere
journey
is
vital
for
the
welfare
of
the
country
even
if
the
government
wo
or
ca
explain
what
the
nowhere
journey
is
that
all
right
with
us
but
if
the
government
says
there
is
a
rotation
system
but
does
absolutely
nothing
about
it
we
interested
in
that
do
you
follow
me
yes
cried
stephanie
oh
yes
go
on
the
has
people
in
congress
for
the
current
term
we
hope
to
raise
that
number
to
for
next
election
a
long
fight
a
slow
uphill
fight
and
frankly
my
dear
we
need
all
the
help
we
can
get
people
young
women
like
yourself
my
dear
are
entirely
too
lethargic
if
you
forgive
me
you
ought
to
forgive
said
stephanie
if
you
will
you
know
it
funny
i
had
vague
ideas
about
helping
kit
about
finding
some
way
to
get
him
back
only
to
tackle
something
like
that
alone
i
only
just
a
girl
and
i
do
know
anyone
important
no
one
ever
comes
back
that
what
you
hear
but
there
a
rotation
system
you
also
hear
that
if
i
can
be
of
any
help
you
certainly
can
my
dear
we
be
delighted
to
have
you
then
eventually
maybe
just
maybe
we
start
getting
them
rotated
home
we
ca
promise
a
thing
we
can
only
try
and
i
never
did
say
try
to
get
the
boys
rotated
my
dear
there
is
a
rotation
system
in
the
law
right
there
in
public
law
but
if
no
men
have
ever
been
rotated
there
must
be
a
reason
for
it
yes
but
but
we
see
if
for
some
reason
rotation
simply
is
not
practicable
we
find
another
way
which
is
why
we
call
ourselves
the
complete
emancipation
league
for
women
if
men
must
embark
on
the
nowhere
journey
the
least
they
can
do
is
let
their
women
volunteer
to
go
along
with
them
if
they
want
to
since
it
may
be
forever
let
a
bunch
of
women
get
to
this
nowhere
place
and
you
never
know
what
might
happen
that
what
i
say
something
about
the
gray
haired
woman
earthly
confidence
imbued
stephanie
with
an
optimism
she
never
expected
well
she
said
smiling
if
we
ca
bring
ourselves
to
mohammed
no
that
all
wrong
to
the
mountain
yes
there
an
old
saying
but
it
is
important
you
get
the
idea
my
dear
how
would
you
like
to
go
to
nowhere
i
to
kit
anywhere
anywhere
never
forget
yesterday
kit
darling
never
i
make
no
promises
stephanie
but
it
may
be
sooner
than
you
think
morning
be
hanged
perhaps
i
will
have
some
sherry
after
all
umm
you
would
by
any
chance
have
some
canadian
instead
humming
stephanie
dashed
into
the
kitchen
for
some
glasses
there
were
times
when
the
real
alaric
arkalion
iii
wished
his
father
would
mind
his
own
business
like
that
thing
about
the
nowhere
journey
for
instance
maybe
alaric
did
realize
it
but
being
the
spoiled
son
of
a
billionaire
was
all
fun
i
a
dilettante
alaric
would
tell
himself
often
gazing
in
the
mirror
a
bored
dilettante
at
the
age
of
which
in
itself
he
had
to
admit
was
too
bad
but
having
reneged
on
the
nowhere
journey
in
favor
of
a
stranger
twice
his
age
who
now
carried
his
alaric
face
had
engendered
some
annoying
complications
you
either
have
to
hide
or
change
your
own
appearance
and
identity
alaric
hide
for
how
long
father
i
ca
be
sure
years
probably
that
crazy
i
not
going
to
hide
for
years
then
change
your
appearance
your
way
of
life
your
occupation
i
have
no
occupation
get
one
change
your
face
too
your
fingerprints
it
can
be
done
become
a
new
man
live
a
new
life
in
hiding
there
was
boredom
impossible
boredom
in
the
other
alternative
there
was
adventure
intrigue
but
uncertainty
one
part
of
young
alaric
craved
that
uncertainty
the
rest
of
him
shunned
it
in
a
way
it
was
like
the
nowhere
journey
all
over
again
maybe
nowhere
would
have
been
so
bad
said
alaric
to
his
father
choosing
as
a
temporary
alternative
and
retreat
what
he
knew
possibly
happen
could
it
if
i
choose
another
identity
i
be
eligible
again
for
the
nowhere
journey
by
george
i
had
considered
that
no
wait
you
could
be
older
than
i
like
it
the
way
i
am
alaric
said
pouting
then
you
have
to
hide
i
spent
ten
million
dollars
to
secure
your
future
alaric
i
do
want
you
to
throw
it
away
alaric
pouted
some
more
let
me
think
about
it
fair
enough
but
i
want
your
answer
tomorrow
meanwhile
you
are
not
to
leave
the
house
alaric
agreed
verbally
but
took
the
first
opportunity
which
presented
itself
that
very
night
to
sneak
out
the
servants
door
go
downtown
and
get
stewed
to
the
gills
at
two
in
the
morning
he
was
picked
up
by
the
police
for
disorderly
conduct
it
had
happened
before
after
losing
a
fistfight
to
a
much
poorer
much
meaner
drunk
in
a
downtown
bar
they
questioned
alaric
at
the
police
station
examined
his
belongings
went
through
his
wallet
notified
his
home
fuming
alaric
rushed
to
the
police
station
to
get
his
son
he
was
met
by
the
desk
sergeant
a
fat
balding
man
who
wore
his
uniform
in
a
slovenly
fashion
mr
arkalion
demanded
the
sergeant
picking
at
his
teeth
with
a
toothpick
yes
i
have
come
for
alaric
my
son
sure
sure
but
your
son
in
trouble
arkalion
serious
trouble
what
are
you
talking
about
if
there
are
any
damages
i
pay
he
did
hurt
anyone
did
he
the
sergeant
broke
the
toothpick
between
his
teeth
laughed
him
naw
he
got
the
hell
beat
out
of
him
by
a
drunk
half
his
size
it
ai
that
kind
of
trouble
arkalion
you
know
what
an
card
is
mister
arkalion
face
drained
white
why
yes
alaric
got
one
naturally
according
to
the
card
he
should
have
shipped
out
on
the
nowhere
journey
mister
he
did
he
in
serious
trouble
i
see
the
district
attorney
more
likely
you
see
the
attorney
general
serious
trouble
chapter
v
the
trouble
with
the
stalintrek
sophia
thought
was
that
it
took
months
to
get
absolutely
nowhere
there
had
been
the
painful
pressure
the
loss
of
consciousness
the
confinement
in
this
tight
little
world
of
dormitories
and
gleaming
metal
walls
the
uncanny
feeling
of
no
weight
the
ability
boring
after
a
while
but
interesting
at
first
to
float
about
in
air
almost
at
will
then
how
many
months
of
sameness
sophia
had
lost
all
track
of
time
through
but
for
the
first
brief
period
of
adjustment
on
the
part
of
her
fellows
to
the
fact
that
although
she
was
a
woman
and
shared
their
man
life
she
was
still
to
be
inviolate
the
routine
had
been
anything
but
exciting
the
period
of
adjustment
had
had
its
adventures
its
uncertainties
its
challenge
and
to
sophia
it
had
been
stimulating
why
was
it
she
wondered
that
the
men
who
carried
their
sex
with
strength
and
dignity
the
men
who
could
have
their
way
with
her
if
they
resorted
to
force
were
the
men
who
did
not
violate
her
privacy
while
the
weaklings
the
softer
smaller
men
or
the
average
men
whom
sophia
considered
her
physical
equals
were
the
ones
who
gave
her
trouble
she
had
always
accepted
her
beauty
the
obvious
attraction
men
found
in
her
with
an
objective
unconcern
she
had
been
endowed
with
sex
appeal
there
was
not
much
room
in
her
life
to
exploit
it
even
had
she
wanted
to
now
now
when
she
wanted
anything
but
that
it
gave
her
trouble
her
room
was
shared
of
necessity
with
three
men
tall
gangling
boris
gave
her
no
trouble
turned
his
back
when
she
undressed
for
the
evening
even
though
she
was
careful
to
slip
under
the
covers
first
ivan
the
second
man
was
short
thin
stooped
often
she
found
him
looking
at
her
with
what
might
have
been
more
than
a
healthy
interest
but
aside
from
that
he
kept
his
peace
besides
ivan
had
spent
two
years
in
secondary
school
as
much
as
sophia
and
she
enjoyed
conversing
with
him
the
third
man
georgi
was
the
troublemaker
georgi
was
one
of
those
plump
young
men
with
red
cheeks
big
eager
eyes
a
voice
somewhat
too
high
he
was
an
avid
talker
a
boaster
and
a
bore
in
the
beginning
he
showered
attentions
on
sophia
he
insisted
on
drawing
her
at
night
escorted
her
to
breakfast
every
morning
told
her
in
confidence
of
the
conquests
he
had
made
over
beautiful
women
but
not
as
beautiful
as
you
sophia
he
soon
began
to
take
liberties
he
would
sit
timorously
at
first
but
with
growing
boldness
on
the
corner
of
her
bed
talking
with
her
at
night
after
the
others
had
retired
ivan
with
his
snores
boris
with
his
strong
deep
breathing
and
night
after
night
plump
georgi
grew
bolder
he
would
reach
out
and
touch
sophia
he
would
insist
on
tucking
her
in
at
night
let
me
be
your
big
brother
he
would
awaken
her
in
the
morning
with
his
hand
heavy
on
her
shoulder
finally
one
night
at
bedtime
she
heard
him
conversing
in
low
whispers
with
ivan
and
boris
she
could
not
hear
the
words
but
boris
looked
at
her
with
what
she
thought
was
surprise
ivan
nodded
in
an
understanding
way
and
both
of
them
left
the
room
sophia
frowned
what
did
you
tell
them
georgi
that
we
wanted
to
be
alone
one
evening
of
course
i
never
gave
you
any
indication
i
could
see
it
in
your
eyes
in
the
way
you
looked
at
me
well
you
had
better
call
them
back
inside
and
go
to
bed
georgi
shook
his
head
approached
her
georgi
call
them
back
or
i
will
no
you
wo
georgi
followed
her
as
she
retreated
into
a
corner
of
the
room
when
she
reached
the
wall
and
could
retreat
no
further
he
placed
his
thick
hands
on
her
shoulders
drew
her
to
him
slowly
you
will
call
no
one
he
rasped
she
ducked
under
his
arms
eluded
him
was
on
the
point
of
running
to
the
door
throwing
it
open
and
shouting
when
she
considered
if
she
did
she
would
be
asking
for
quarter
gaining
a
temporary
reprieve
inviting
the
same
sort
of
thing
all
over
again
she
crossed
to
the
bed
and
sat
down
come
here
georgi
ah
he
came
to
her
she
watched
him
warily
a
soft
flabby
man
not
quite
so
tall
as
she
was
but
who
nevertheless
outweighed
her
by
thirty
or
forty
pounds
in
his
eagerness
he
walked
too
fast
lost
his
footing
and
floated
gently
to
the
ceiling
smiling
as
demurely
as
she
could
sophia
reached
up
circled
his
ankle
with
her
hand
i
never
could
get
used
to
this
weightlessness
georgi
admitted
be
nice
and
pull
me
down
i
will
be
nice
i
will
teach
you
a
lesson
he
weighed
exactly
nothing
it
was
as
simple
as
stretching
sophia
merely
extended
her
arm
upwards
and
georgi
head
hit
the
ceiling
with
a
loud
georgi
groaned
sophia
repeated
the
procedure
lowering
her
arm
a
foot
and
georgi
with
it
then
raising
it
and
bouncing
his
head
off
the
ceiling
i
do
understand
georgi
whined
trying
to
break
free
but
only
succeeding
in
thrashing
his
chubby
arms
foolishly
you
have
mastered
weightlessness
sophia
smiled
up
at
him
i
have
i
said
i
would
teach
you
a
lesson
first
make
sure
you
have
the
strength
of
a
man
if
you
would
play
a
man
game
still
smiling
sophia
commenced
spinning
the
hand
which
held
ankle
arms
and
free
leg
flailing
air
helplessly
georgi
began
to
spin
put
me
down
he
whined
a
boy
now
not
even
pretending
to
be
a
man
when
sophia
shoved
out
gently
and
let
his
ankle
go
he
did
a
neat
flip
in
air
and
hung
suspended
upside
down
his
feet
near
the
ceiling
his
head
on
a
level
with
sophia
shoulders
he
cried
she
slapped
his
upside
down
face
carefully
and
without
excitement
reddening
the
cheeks
i
was
only
joking
he
slobbered
call
back
our
friends
sophia
found
one
of
the
hard
metal
flasks
they
used
for
drinking
in
weightlessness
with
one
hand
she
opened
the
lid
with
the
other
she
grasped
georgi
shoulder
and
spun
him
in
air
still
upside
down
she
squirted
the
water
in
his
face
and
because
he
was
upside
down
and
yelling
it
made
him
choke
and
cough
when
the
container
was
empty
she
lowered
georgi
gently
to
the
floor
minutes
later
she
opened
the
door
summoned
boris
and
ivan
who
came
into
the
room
what
they
found
was
a
thoroughly
beaten
georgi
sobbing
on
the
floor
after
that
sophia
had
no
trouble
week
after
week
of
boredom
followed
and
she
almost
wished
georgi
or
someone
else
would
for
trouble
even
if
it
were
something
she
could
not
handle
for
although
she
was
stronger
than
average
and
more
beautiful
she
was
still
a
woman
first
and
she
knew
if
the
right
man
did
you
know
that
radio
communication
is
maintained
between
earth
and
mars
the
alaric
arkalion
on
mars
asked
temple
why
no
i
never
thought
about
it
it
is
and
i
am
in
some
difficulty
what
the
matter
temple
had
grown
to
like
arkalion
despite
the
man
peculiarities
he
had
given
up
trying
to
figure
him
out
feeling
that
the
only
way
he
get
anywhere
was
with
arkalion
cooperation
it
a
long
story
which
i
afraid
you
would
not
altogether
understand
the
authorities
on
earth
do
think
i
belong
here
on
the
nowhere
journey
is
that
so
a
mistake
huh
i
sure
am
glad
for
you
alaric
that
not
the
difficulty
it
seems
that
there
is
the
matter
of
impersonation
of
violating
some
of
the
clauses
in
public
law
you
glad
for
me
i
likely
to
go
to
prison
if
it
that
serious
how
come
they
told
you
they
did
but
i
managed
to
find
out
i
wo
go
into
details
kit
but
obviously
if
i
managed
to
embark
for
nowhere
when
i
have
to
then
i
wanted
to
go
right
i
uh
guess
so
but
why
that
is
the
point
i
want
to
go
not
to
mars
but
to
nowhere
i
still
can
despite
what
has
happened
but
i
need
help
temple
said
anything
i
can
do
i
be
glad
to
and
meant
it
for
one
thing
he
liked
arkalion
for
another
arkalion
seemed
to
know
more
much
more
than
he
would
ever
say
unless
temple
could
win
his
confidence
for
a
third
temple
was
growing
sick
and
tired
of
mars
with
its
drab
ochre
sameness
when
he
got
to
the
surface
which
was
rarely
with
its
dank
underground
city
with
its
meaningless
attention
to
meaningless
detail
either
way
he
figured
there
was
no
returning
to
earth
if
nowhere
meant
adventure
as
he
suspected
it
might
it
would
be
preferable
mars
might
have
been
the
other
end
of
the
galaxy
for
all
its
nearness
to
earth
anyway
there
is
a
great
deal
you
can
do
but
you
have
to
come
with
me
where
temple
demanded
where
you
will
go
eventually
to
nowhere
fine
and
temple
smiled
why
not
now
as
well
as
later
i
be
frank
with
you
if
you
go
now
you
go
untrained
you
may
need
your
training
undoubtedly
you
will
you
know
a
lot
more
than
you
want
to
talk
about
do
you
frankly
yes
i
am
sorry
kit
that
all
right
you
have
your
reasons
i
guess
if
i
go
with
you
find
out
soon
enough
anyway
arkalion
grinned
you
have
guessed
correctly
i
am
going
to
nowhere
before
they
return
me
to
earth
for
prosecution
under
public
law
i
can
not
go
alone
for
it
takes
at
least
two
to
operate
well
see
count
me
in
said
temple
remember
you
may
one
day
wish
you
had
remained
on
mars
for
your
training
i
take
my
chances
mars
is
driving
me
crazy
all
i
do
is
think
of
earth
and
stephanie
then
come
where
are
we
going
a
long
long
way
off
it
is
unthinkably
remote
this
place
called
nowhere
temple
felt
suddenly
like
a
kid
playing
hookey
from
school
lead
on
he
said
almost
jauntily
he
knew
he
was
leaving
stephanie
still
further
behind
but
had
he
been
in
prison
on
the
next
street
to
hers
he
might
as
well
have
been
a
million
miles
away
as
for
arkalion
the
thought
suddenly
struck
temple
arkalion
necessarily
leaving
his
world
further
behind
perhaps
arkalion
was
going
home
stephanie
picked
up
the
phone
eagerly
in
the
weeks
since
her
first
meeting
with
draper
of
the
the
older
woman
had
been
a
fountain
of
information
and
of
hope
for
her
stephanie
for
her
part
had
taken
over
draper
job
in
her
own
section
of
center
city
she
was
busy
contacting
the
two
hundred
mothers
and
fifty
sweethearts
of
the
nowhere
journey
which
had
taken
kit
from
her
and
now
draper
had
called
with
information
we
successfully
combined
forces
with
some
of
the
less
militant
elements
in
both
houses
of
congress
draper
told
her
over
the
phone
do
you
realize
my
dear
this
marks
the
first
time
the
has
managed
to
put
something
constructive
through
congress
until
now
we
been
content
merely
to
block
legislation
such
as
an
increase
in
the
nowhere
contingent
from
yes
draper
i
know
all
that
but
what
about
this
constructive
thing
you
done
well
my
dear
do
count
your
chickens
but
we
passed
the
bill
and
we
expect
the
president
wo
veto
it
you
see
the
president
has
two
nephews
who
i
know
i
know
what
bill
did
you
pass
unfortunately
it
somewhat
vague
ultimately
the
nowhere
commission
must
do
the
deciding
but
it
does
pave
the
way
for
what
mrs
draper
hold
onto
your
hat
my
dear
the
bill
authorizes
the
nowhere
commission
to
make
as
much
of
a
study
as
it
can
of
conditions
wherever
our
boys
are
sent
oh
stephanie
was
disappointed
that
wo
get
them
back
to
us
no
you
right
it
wo
get
them
back
to
us
that
is
the
idea
at
all
for
there
is
more
than
one
way
to
skin
a
cat
my
dear
the
nowhere
commission
will
be
studying
conditions
how
can
they
i
thought
everything
was
so
not
even
congress
knew
anything
about
it
that
was
the
first
big
hurdle
we
have
apparently
overcome
anyway
they
will
be
studying
conditions
with
a
view
of
determining
if
one
girl
just
one
mind
you
can
embark
on
the
nowhere
journey
as
a
pilot
study
and
but
i
thought
they
could
make
the
journey
only
once
every
days
get
congress
aroused
and
you
can
move
mountains
it
seems
the
expense
entailed
in
a
trip
at
any
but
those
times
is
generally
prohibitive
but
when
something
special
comes
up
it
can
be
done
draper
how
i
love
to
talk
with
you
see
there
you
go
my
dear
counting
your
chickens
one
girl
will
be
sent
if
the
study
indicates
she
can
take
it
one
girl
stephanie
and
only
after
a
study
she
merely
be
a
pilot
case
but
afterwards
ah
afterwards
perhaps
someday
soon
qualified
women
will
be
able
to
join
their
men
in
nowhere
draper
i
love
you
naturally
you
will
tell
all
this
to
prospective
members
now
we
have
something
concrete
to
work
with
i
know
and
i
will
i
will
draper
by
the
way
how
are
they
going
to
pick
the
girl
the
one
girl
do
count
your
chickens
for
heaven
sake
they
have
even
studied
the
situation
yet
well
i
call
you
my
dear
stephanie
hung
up
dressed
went
about
her
canvassing
she
thought
happy
thoughts
all
week
shh
quiet
cautioned
arkalion
leading
the
way
down
a
flight
of
plastic
stairs
how
do
you
know
your
way
around
here
so
well
i
said
quiet
it
was
not
so
much
temple
realized
that
arkalion
was
really
afraid
of
making
noise
rather
he
did
not
want
to

temple
smiled
in
the
heard
the
steady
of
water
off
somewhere
to
his
left
eons
before
the
coming
of
man
on
this
stopover
point
to
nowhere
the
martian
waters
had
retreated
from
the
planet
ancient
surface
and
seeped
underground
to
carve
slow
drop
by
drop
the
caverns
which
the
planet
you
know
your
way
around
so
well
i
swear
you
were
a
martian
arkalion
soft
laugh
carried
far
i
said
there
was
to
be
no
noise
please
as
for
the
martians
the
only
martians
are
here
all
around
you
the
men
of
earth
ahh
here
we
are
at
the
bottom
of
the
flight
of
stairs
temple
could
see
a
door
metallic
giving
the
impression
of
strength
without
great
weight
arkalion
paused
a
moment
did
something
with
a
series
of
levers
shook
his
head
impatiently
started
all
over
again
what
that
for
temple
wanted
to
know
what
do
you
think
it
is
a
combination
lock
with
five
million
possible
combinations
do
you
want
to
be
here
for
all
of
eternity
no
then
quiet
vaguely
temple
wondered
why
the
door
was
guarded
with
a
lock
like
this
arkalion
explained
as
if
he
had
read
thought
they
need
no
other
precaution
it
is
assumed
that
only
authorized
personnel
know
the
combination
then
had
arkalion
come
this
way
before
it
seemed
the
only
possible
assumption
but
when
and
how
here
we
are
said
arkalion
the
door
swung
in
toward
them
temple
strode
forward
found
himself
in
a
great
bare
hall
surprisingly
after
the
dimness
of
the
caverns
he
hardly
could
see
do
stand
there
scowling
and
fussing
with
your
eyes
there
is
one
additional
precaution
an
alarm
at
central
headquarters
we
have
about
five
minutes
no
more
at
one
end
of
the
bare
hall
stood
what
to
temple
looked
for
all
the
world
like
an
telephone
booth
except
that
its
walls
were
completely
opaque
on
the
wall
adjacent
to
it
was
a
single
lever
with
two
positions
marked
hold
and
transport
the
lever
stood
firmly
in
the
hold
position
you
sure
you
want
to
come
arkalion
demanded
yes
i
told
you
that
good
i
have
no
time
to
explain
i
will
enter
the
conveyor
conveyor
this
booth
you
will
wait
until
the
door
is
shut
then
pull
the
lever
down
that
is
all
there
is
to
it
but
as
you
can
see
it
is
a
operation
but
how
do
i
haste
haste
there
are
similar
controls
at
the
other
end
you
pull
the
lever
wait
two
minutes
enter
the
conveyor
yourself
i
will
fetch
you
if
you
are
sure
i
sure
dammit
remember
you
go
without
training
without
the
opportunity
everyone
else
has
you
already
told
me
that
mars
is
halfway
to
eternity
mars
is
limbo
if
i
ca
go
back
to
earth
i
want
to
go
well
to
nowhere
there
are
too
many
ghosts
here
too
many
memories
with
nothing
to
do
arkalion
shrugged
entered
the
booth
pull
the
lever
he
said
and
shut
the
door
temple
reached
up
grasped
the
lever
firmly
in
his
hand
yanked
it
it
slid
smoothly
to
the
position
marked
transport
temple
heard
nothing
saw
nothing
began
to
think
the
device
whatever
it
was
did
not
work
did
arkalion
somehow
get
inside
the
booth
temple
thought
he
heard
footfalls
on
the
stairs
outside
soon
faintly
he
could
hear
voices
someone
banged
on
the
door
to
the
hall
licking
dry
lips
temple
opened
the
booth
peered
inside
empty
the
voices
clamored
fists
pounded
on
the
door
something
clicked
tumblers
fell
the
door
to
the
great
bright
hall
sprung
outward
someone
rushed
in
at
temple
who
met
him
savagely
with
a
short
chopping
blow
to
his
jaw
the
man
temporarily
blinded
by
the
dazzling
light
stumbled
back
in
the
path
of
his
fellows
temple
darted
into
the
booth
the
conveyor
and
slammed
it
shut
fingers
clawed
on
the
outside
a
sound
almost
too
intense
to
be
heard
rang
in
temple
ears
he
lost
consciousness
instantly
chapter
vi
what
a
cockeyed
world
said
alaric
arkalion
to
his
son
you
certainly
ca
plan
on
anything
even
if
you
do
have
more
money
than
you
ever
possibly
need
in
a
lifetime
do
feel
like
that
said
young
alaric
i
not
in
prison
any
longer
am
i
no
but
you
not
free
of
the
nowhere
journey
either
there
is
an
unheralded
special
trip
to
nowhere
two
weeks
from
today
i
have
been
informed
oh
yes
oh
i
have
also
been
informed
that
you
will
be
on
it
you
escape
after
all
alaric
oh
oh
what
bothers
me
most
is
that
scoundrel
smith
somehow
managed
to
escape
they
have
found
him
yet
i
have
also
been
informed
and
since
my
contract
with
him
calls
for
ten
million
dollars
services
rendered
i
have
to
pay
but
he
did
prevent
me
from
i
ca
air
this
thing
alaric
but
listen
son
when
you
go
where
you
are
going
you
liable
to
find
another
alaric
arkalion
your
double
of
course
that
would
be
smith
if
you
can
get
him
to
cut
his
price
in
half
because
of
what
has
happened
i
would
be
delighted
if
you
could
somehow
manage
to
wring
his
neck
i
would
be
even
more
delighted
ten
million
dollars
for
nothing
i
so
excited
murmured
draper
stephanie
watched
her
on
one
of
the
new
televiewers
recently
installed
in
place
of
the
telephone
what
is
it
our
bill
has
been
passed
by
a
landslide
majority
in
both
houses
of
congress
ooo
cried
stephanie
not
very
coherent
my
dear
but
those
are
my
sentiments
exactly
in
two
weeks
there
will
be
a
journey
to
nowhere
a
special
one
which
will
include
among
its
passengers
a
woman
but
the
study
which
had
to
be
made
it
already
been
made
from
what
i
gather
they
ca
take
it
very
far
most
of
their
conclusions
had
to
be
based
on
supposition
the
important
thing
though
is
this
a
woman
be
sent
the
way
the
figures
it
my
dear
is
that
a
woman
falling
in
the
to
age
group
should
be
chosen
a
woman
who
meets
all
the
requirements
placed
upon
the
young
men
yes
said
stephanie
of
course
and
i
was
just
thinking
that
i
would
be
remember
those
chickens
cautioned
draper
we
already
have
one
hundred
volunteers
who
claw
each
other
to
pieces
for
a
chance
to
go
wrong
stephanie
said
smiling
you
now
have
one
hundred
room
for
only
one
my
dear
only
one
you
know
then
cross
the
others
off
your
list
i
already
packing
my
bag
when
temple
regained
consciousness
it
was
with
the
feeling
that
no
more
than
a
split
second
of
time
had
elapsed
so
much
had
happened
so
rapidly
that
until
now
he
had
had
time
to
consider
it
arkalion
had
vanished
vanished
he
could
use
no
other
word
he
was
there
standing
in
the
booth
and
then
he
was
simple
as
that
now
you
see
it
now
you
do
and
goodbye
arkalion
but
goodbye
temple
too
for
had
temple
entered
the
same
booth
waiting
but
a
second
until
arkalion
activated
the
mechanism
at
the
other
end
and
certainly
temple
was
in
the
booth
now
he
smiled
at
the
ridiculously
simple
logic
of
his
thoughts
he
stood
in
an
open
field
the
blades
of
grass
rising
to
his
knees
as
much
brilliant
purple
as
they
were
green
waves
of
the
grass
stirred
like
tide
by
the
gentle
wind
and
hills
rolling
off
toward
the
horizon
in
whichever
direction
he
turned
far
away
the
undulating
hills
lifted
to
a
half
soft
mauve
sky
a
somber
red
sun
with
twice
sol
apparent
disc
but
half
its
brightness
hung
between
zenith
and
horizon
completing
the
picture
of
peaceful
wherever
this
was
it
was
earth
or
mars
nowhere
temple
shrugged
started
walking
he
chose
his
direction
at
random
crushing
an
easily
discernible
path
behind
him
in
the
surprisingly
brittle
grass
the
warm
sun
baked
his
back
comfortably
the
wind
caressed
his
cheeks
of
arkalion
he
found
not
a
trace
two
hours
later
temple
reached
the
hills
and
started
climbing
their
gentle
slopes
it
was
then
that
he
saw
the
figure
approaching
on
the
run
it
took
him
fully
half
a
minute
to
realize
that
the
runner
was
not
human
after
months
of
weightless
inactivity
things
started
to
happen
for
sophia
the
feeling
of
weight
returned
but
weight
as
she
never
had
felt
it
before
it
was
as
if
someone
was
sitting
on
every
inch
of
her
body
crushing
her
down
it
made
her
gasp
forced
her
eyes
shut
and
although
she
could
not
see
it
contorted
her
face
horribly
she
lost
consciousness
coming
to
some
time
later
with
a
dreadful
feeling
of
loginess
someone
swam
into
her
vision
dimly
stung
her
arm
briefly
with
a
needle
she
slept
she
was
on
a
table
stretched
out
with
lights
glaring
down
at
her
she
heard
voices
the
new
system
is
far
better
than
testing
comrade
far
more
efficient
far
more
objective
yes
the
brain
emits
electromagnetic
vibration
strange
is
it
not
that
no
one
before
ever
imagined
it
could
tell
a
story
a
completely
accurate
story
two
years
of
testing
could
not
give
us
in
russia
we
have
gone
far
with
the
biological
psychological
sciences
the
west
flies
high
with
physics
give
them
mars
bah
they
can
have
mars
true
comrade
the
journey
to
jupiter
is
greater
the
time
consumed
is
longer
the
cost
more
expensive
but
here
on
jupiter
we
can
do
something
they
can
not
do
on
mars
i
know
we
can
make
supermen
supermen
comrade
a
wedding
of
nietzsche
and
marx
careful
those
are
dangerous
thoughts
merely
an
allusion
comrade
merely
a
harmless
allusion
but
you
take
an
ordinary
human
being
and
train
him
on
jupiter
speeding
his
and
metabolic
rate
tremendously
with
certain
endocrine
secretions
so
that
one
day
is
as
a
month
to
him
you
take
him
and
subject
him
to
big
jupiter
pull
of
gravity
more
than
twice
earth
and
in
three
weeks
you
have
yes
you
have
a
superman
the
woman
wakes
shh
do
not
frighten
her
sophia
stretched
every
muscle
in
her
body
aching
slowly
as
in
a
dream
she
sat
up
it
required
strength
the
mere
act
of
pulling
her
torso
upright
what
have
you
done
to
me
she
cried
focusing
her
vision
on
the
two
men
nothing
comrade
relax
sophia
turned
slowly
on
the
table
got
one
long
shapely
leg
draped
over
its
edge
careful
comrade
what
were
they
warning
her
about
she
merely
wanted
to
get
up
and
stretch
perhaps
then
she
would
feel
better
her
toe
touched
the
floor
she
swung
her
other
leg
over
aware
of
but
ignoring
her
nakedness
a
good
specimen
oh
yes
comrade
so
this
time
they
send
a
woman
among
the
others
well
we
shall
do
our
work
look
see
the
way
she
is
formed
so
lithe
agile
see
the
toning
of
the
muscles
her
beauty
will
remain
comrade
but
jupiter
shall
make
an
amazon
of
her
sophia
had
both
feet
on
the
floor
now
she
was
breathing
hard
felt
suddenly
sick
to
her
stomach
placing
both
her
hands
on
the
table
edge
she
pushed
off
and
staggered
for
two
or
three
paces
she
crumpled
buckling
first
at
the
knees
then
the
waist
and
fell
in
a
writhing
heap
pick
her
up
hands
under
her
arms
tugging
she
came
off
the
floor
easily
dimly
aware
that
someone
carried
her
hundred
and
thirty
pounds
effortlessly
put
me
down
she
cried
i
want
to
try
again
i
am
crippled
crippled
you
have
crippled
me
nothing
of
the
sort
comrade
you
are
tired
weak
and
gravity
field
is
still
too
strong
for
you
little
by
little
though
your
muscles
will
strengthen
to
jupiter
demands
gravity
will
keep
them
from
bulging
expanding
but
every
muscle
fibre
in
you
will
have
twice
three
times
its
original
strength
are
you
excited
i
am
tired
and
sick
i
want
to
sleep
what
is
jupiter
jupiter
is
a
planet
circling
the
sun
at
never
mind
comrade
you
have
much
to
learn
but
you
can
assimilate
it
with
much
less
trouble
in
your
sleep
go
ahead
sleep
sophia
retched
was
sick
it
had
been
years
since
she
cried
but
naked
afraid
bewildered
she
cried
herself
to
sleep
things
happened
while
she
slept
many
things
certain
endocrine
extracts
accelerated
her
metabolism
astonishingly
within
half
an
hour
her
heart
was
pumping
blood
through
her
body
two
hundred
beats
per
minute
an
hour
later
it
reached
its
full
rate
almost
one
thousand
contractions
every
sixty
seconds
all
her
other
metabolic
functions
increased
accordingly
and
sophia
slept
deeply
for
a
week
of
subjective
time
in
hours
the
same
machine
which
had
gleaned
everything
from
her
mind
far
more
accurately
than
a
battery
of
tests
a
refinement
of
the
was
now
played
in
reverse
giving
back
to
sophia
everything
it
had
taken
plus
electrospool
after
electrospool
of
science
mathematics
logic
economics
history
marxian
these
last
two
languages
including
english
semantics
and
certain
specialized
knowledge
she
would
need
later
on
the
stalintrek
still
sleeping
sophia
was
bathed
in
a
warm
whirlpool
of
soothing
liquid
rubbed
massaged
her
begun
while
she
rested
and
regained
her
strength
three
hours
later
objective
time
she
awoke
with
a
headache
and
with
more
thoughts
spinning
around
madly
inside
her
brain
than
she
ever
knew
existed
gingerly
she
tried
standing
again
lifting
herself
nude
and
dripping
wet
from
a
tub
of
steaming
amber
stuff
she
stood
stretched
permitted
her
fright
to
vanish
with
a
quick
wave
of
vertigo
which
engulfed
her
she
had
been
fed
intravenously
but
a
tremendous
hunger
possessed
her
before
eating
however
she
was
to
find
herself
in
a
gymnasium
the
air
close
and
stifling
she
was
massaged
again
told
to
do
certain
exercises
which
seemed
simple
but
which
she
found
extremely
difficult
forced
to
run
until
she
thought
she
would
collapse
with
her
legs
dragging
like
lead
she
understood
now
somehow
she
knew
she
was
on
jupiter
the
fifth
and
largest
planet
where
the
force
of
gravity
is
so
much
greater
than
on
earth
that
it
is
an
effort
even
to
walk
she
also
knew
that
her
metabolic
rate
had
been
accelerated
beyond
all
comprehension
and
that
in
a
comparatively
short
time
objective
time
she
would
have
thrice
her
original
strength
all
this
she
knew
without
knowing
how
she
knew
and
that
was
the
most
staggering
fact
of
all
she
did
what
her
curt
instructors
bid
then
dragged
her
aching
muscles
and
her
headache
into
a
dining
room
where
tired
men
sat
around
eating
well
the
food
at
least
was
good
sophia
attacked
it
ravenously
it
did
not
take
temple
long
to
realize
that
the
creature
running
downhill
at
him
leaving
a
crushed
and
broken
wake
in
the
purple
and
green
grass
was
not
human
at
first
temple
toyed
with
the
idea
of
a
man
on
horseback
for
the
creature
ran
on
four
limbs
and
had
two
left
over
as
arms
temple
gaped
the
whole
thing
was
one
piece
centaur
hardly
too
small
for
one
thing
no
bigger
than
a
man
despite
the
three
pairs
of
limbs
and
then
temple
had
time
to
gape
no
longer
for
the
creature
whatever
it
was
flashed
past
him
at
what
he
now
had
to
consider
a
gallop
more
followed
different
temple
stared
and
stared
one
could
have
been
a
great
sentient
hoop
rolling
downhill
and
gathering
momentum
if
he
carried
the
wheel
analogy
further
a
huge
eye
stared
at
him
from
where
the
hub
would
have
been
something
else
followed
with
kangaroo
leaps
one
leg
propelled
it
in
tremendous
strides
while
its
small
arms
beat
the
air
prodigiously
legions
of
creatures
all
fantastically
different
going
temple
thought
then
said
it
aloud
i
going
crazy
theorizing
thus
he
heard
a
whir
overhead
whirled
looked
up
something
was
poised
a
dozen
feet
off
the
ground
a
large
object
seven
or
eight
feet
across
rotors
spinning
above
it
that
at
least
he
could
understand
a
helicopter
i
lowering
a
ladder
kit
swing
aboard
arkalion
voice
stunned
enough
to
accept
anything
he
saw
temple
waited
for
the
rope
ladder
to
drop
grasped
its
end
climbed
he
swung
his
legs
over
a
sill
found
himself
in
a
neat
little
cabin
with
arkalion
who
hauled
the
ladder
in
and
did
something
to
the
controls
they
sped
away
temple
had
one
quick
moment
of
lucid
thought
before
everything
which
had
happened
in
the
last
few
moments
shoved
logic
aside
what
he
had
observed
looked
for
all
the
world
like
a
where
the
hell
we
temple
demanded
breathlessly
arkalion
smiled
where
do
you
think
journey
end
welcome
to
nowhere
kit
welcome
to
the
place
where
all
your
questions
can
be
answered
because
there
no
going
back
sorry
i
set
you
down
in
that
field
by
mistake
incidentally
those
things
sometimes
happen
can
i
just
throw
the
questions
at
you
if
you
wish
it
is
really
necessary
for
you
will
be
indoctrinated
when
we
get
you
over
to
earth
city
where
you
belong
what
do
you
mean
there
no
going
back
i
thought
they
had
a
rotation
system
which
for
one
reason
or
another
was
practical
at
the
moment
that
does
sound
like
no
going
back
ever
arkalion
grunted
shrugged
have
it
your
way
i
sorry
shoot
just
how
far
do
you
think
you
have
come
search
me
some
other
star
system
maybe
maybe
clean
across
the
galaxy
kit
temple
whistled
softly
it
is
something
you
can
grasp
just
by
hearing
it
across
the
galaxy
that
is
too
important
just
now
how
long
did
you
think
the
journey
took
temple
nodded
eagerly
that
what
gets
me
it
was
amazing
alaric
really
amazing
the
whole
trip
could
have
taken
more
than
a
moment
or
two
i
do
get
it
did
we
slip
out
of
normal
space
into
some
other
uh
continuum
and
speed
across
the
length
of
the
galaxy
like
that
the
answer
to
your
questions
is
yes
but
your
statement
is
way
off
the
journey
did
not
take
seconds
kit
no
instantaneous
far
more
than
seconds
to
reach
here
from
earth
you
traveled
five
thousand
years
what
more
correctly
it
was
five
thousand
years
ago
that
you
left
mars
you
would
need
a
time
machine
to
return
and
there
is
no
such
thing
the
earth
you
know
is
the
length
of
the
galaxy
and
five
thousand
years
behind
you
chapter
vii
it
could
have
been
a
city
in
new
england
or
maybe
wisconsin
main
street
stretched
for
half
a
mile
from
town
hall
to
the
small
department
store
neon
tubing
brightened
every
store
front
busy
proprietors
could
be
seen
at
work
through
the
large
plate
glass
windows
there
was
the
bustle
you
might
expect
on
any
main
street
in
new
england
or
wisconsin
but
you
could
not
draw
the
parallel
indefinitely
there
were
only
men
no
women
the
hills
in
which
the
town
nestled
were
too
purple
not
purple
with
distance
but
the
natural
color
of
the
grass
a
somber
red
sun
hung
in
the
pale
mauve
sky
this
was
earth
city
nowhere
arkalion
had
deposited
temple
in
the
nearby
hills
promised
they
would
see
one
another
again
it
may
not
be
so
soon
arkalion
had
said
but
what
the
difference
you
spend
the
rest
of
your
life
here
you
realize
you
are
lucky
kit
if
you
had
come
you
would
have
been
dead
these
five
thousand
years
well
good
luck
dead
five
thousand
years
the
earth
as
he
knew
it
dust
stephanie
a
fifty
generation
corpse
nowhere
was
right
end
of
the
universe
temple
shuffled
his
feet
trudged
on
into
town
a
man
passed
him
on
the
street
stooped
the
man
nodded
did
a
mild
an
unfamiliar
temple
thought
howdy
he
said
i
new
here
that
what
i
thought
stranger
know
just
about
everyone
in
these
here
parts
i
do
and
i
said
to
myself
now
there
a
newcomer
funny
you
did
come
in
the
regular
way
i
here
said
temple
yeah
funny
thing
you
get
to
know
everyone
eh
what
you
say
your
name
was
christopher
temple
make
it
my
business
to
know
everyone
the
neighborly
way
i
always
say
temple
eh
we
have
one
here
one
what
another
fellow
name
of
temple
jase
temple
son
i
be
damned
temple
cried
smiling
suddenly
i
will
be
damned
tell
me
old
timer
where
can
i
find
him
might
be
anyplace
town
it
looks
i
tell
you
though
jase
temple
our
you
find
him
there
the
office
town
hall
down
the
end
of
the
street
i
already
passed
it
temple
told
the
man
and
thanks
temple
legs
carried
him
at
a
brisk
pace
past
the
row
of
store
fronts
and
down
to
the
town
hall
he
read
a
directory
climbed
a
flight
of
stairs
found
a
door
marked
jason
temple
earth
city
heart
pounding
temple
knocked
heard
someone
call
come
in
he
pushed
the
door
in
and
stared
at
his
brother
just
rising
to
face
him
kit
kit
what
are
you
doing
so
you
took
the
journey
too
jason
ran
to
him
clasped
his
shoulders
pounded
them
you
sure
are
looking
fit
kit
you
could
have
knocked
me
over
with
half
a
feather
coming
in
like
that
you
looking
great
too
jase
temple
lied
he
had
seen
his
brother
in
five
years
had
never
expected
to
see
him
again
but
he
remembered
a
smiling
man
somewhat
taller
than
himself
somewhat
broader
across
the
shoulders
the
jason
he
saw
looked
or
fifty
but
was
hardly
out
of
his
twenties
he
had
fierce
smouldering
eyes
gaunt
cheeks
graying
hair
he
seemed
a
bundle
of
restless
nervous
energy
sit
down
kit
start
talking
kid
brother
start
talking
and
stop
till
next
week
tell
me
everything
everything
tell
me
about
the
blue
sky
and
the
moon
at
night
and
the
way
the
ocean
looks
on
a
windy
day
and
five
years
said
temple
five
years
five
thousand
you
mean
jason
reminded
him
it
hardly
seems
possible
how
are
the
folks
kit
mom
fine
pop
too
he
sporting
a
new
chambers
converto
you
should
see
him
jase
sharp
and
ann
jason
looked
at
him
hopefully
ann
had
been
stephanie
but
for
the
nowhere
journey
they
would
have
married
ann
married
temple
said
oh
oh
that
swell
kit
really
swell
i
mean
what
the
hell
a
girl
should
wait
forever
i
told
her
not
to
anyway
she
waited
four
years
then
met
a
guy
and
a
nice
guy
the
best
said
temple
you
like
him
temple
saw
the
vague
hurt
come
to
jason
smouldering
eyes
then
it
was
the
same
one
part
of
jason
wanted
her
to
remain
his
over
an
unthinkable
gap
another
part
wanted
her
to
live
a
good
full
life
i
glad
said
jason
ca
expect
a
girl
to
wait
without
hope
then
there
no
hope
we
ever
get
back
jason
laughed
harshly
you
tell
me
earth
is
merely
sixty
thousand
light
years
away
kit
do
you
know
what
a
light
year
is
temple
said
he
thought
he
did
sixty
thousand
of
them
a
dozen
eternities
but
the
earth
we
know
is
also
dead
dead
five
thousand
years
the
folks
center
city
ann
her
husband
all
dust
five
thousand
years
old
do
mind
me
kit
sure
sure
i
understand
but
temple
did
not
really
you
could
take
five
thousand
years
and
chuck
them
out
the
window
in
what
seemed
the
space
of
a
heart
beat
and
then
realize
they
were
gone
permanently
forever
not
a
period
of
time
as
long
as
all
of
recorded
civilization
you
could
take
it
tack
it
on
after
and
accept
it
somehow
temple
realized
the
five
thousand
years
were
harder
to
swallow
than
the
sixty
thousand
light
years
well
with
a
visible
effort
jason
snapped
out
of
his
reverie
temple
accepted
a
cigarette
gratefully
his
first
in
a
long
time
fifty
he
thought
bitterly
burrowing
deeper
into
a
funk
well
said
jason
i
acting
like
a
prize
boob
how
selfish
can
i
get
there
must
be
an
awful
lot
you
like
to
know
kit
that
all
right
i
was
told
i
be
indoctrinated
ordinarily
you
would
but
there
no
shipment
now
none
for
another
three
months
say
how
the
devil
you
get
here
that
a
long
story
nowhere
journey
same
as
you
with
a
little
assist
to
speed
things
up
on
mars
jase
tell
me
this
what
are
we
doing
here
what
is
everyone
doing
here
what
the
nowhere
journey
all
about
what
kind
of
a
glorified
did
i
see
a
while
ago
with
a
bunch
of
creatures
out
of
the
telio
shows
jason
put
his
own
cigarette
out
changed
his
mind
lit
another
one
sort
of
like
the
old
joke
where
does
an
alien
go
to
register
sort
of
it
a
big
universe
said
jason
evidently
starting
at
the
beginning
of
something
i
just
beginning
to
learn
big
it
would
be
pretty
unimaginative
of
mankind
to
consider
itself
the
only
sentient
form
of
life
earth
the
only
home
of
intelligence
both
from
a
scientific
and
a
religious
point
of
view
we
kind
of
expected
to
find
neighbors
out
in
space
kit
the
sky
is
full
of
stars
most
stars
have
planets
the
universe
crawls
with
life
all
sorts
of
life
all
sorts
of
intelligent
life
in
short
we
are
not
alone
it
would
be
sort
of
like
taking
the
from
washington
to
new
york
during
the
evening
rush
and
expecting
to
be
the
only
one
aboard
in
reality
you
lucky
to
get
breathing
space
there
are
biped
intelligences
like
humans
there
are
radial
intelligences
species
tall
gangling
creatures
squat
ones
pancake
ones
giants
dwarfs
there
are
green
skins
and
pink
skins
and
coal
black
and
yes
no
skins
there
are
but
you
get
the
idea
strangely
enough
most
of
these
intelligences
are
on
about
the
same
developmental
level
it
as
if
the
creator
turned
everything
on
at
once
like
a
race
and
said
guys
get
started
maybe
because
as
scientists
figure
the
whole
universe
got
wound
up
and
started
working
as
a
unit
i
do
know
anyway
that
the
way
it
is
all
the
intelligences
worth
talking
about
are
on
about
the
same
cultural
level
atomics
crude
spaceflight
wars
they
ca
handle
and
this
is
interesting
kit
most
of
are
bipedal
not
really
human
not
fully
human
you
can
see
the
difference
but
percent
of
the
races
i
encountered
have
had
basic
similarities
a
case
of
the
creator
trying
to
figure
out
the
best
of
all
possible
and
coming
up
with
this
one
offers
a
wide
range
for
action
for
adaptation
stuff
like
that
anyway
i
losing
track
of
things
take
it
easy
from
what
you
tell
me
i
have
all
the
time
in
the
world
well
i
said
all
the
races
are
developmentally
parallel
that
almost
true
one
of
them
is
not
one
of
them
is
so
far
ahead
that
the
rest
of
us
have
hardly
reached
the
crawling
stage
by
comparison
one
of
them
is
the
super
race
kit
their
culture
is
old
incredibly
old
so
old
in
fact
that
some
of
us
figure
it
been
hanging
around
since
before
the
universe
took
shape
maybe
that
why
all
the
others
are
on
one
level
a
few
thousand
million
years
behind
the
super
race
so
take
this
super
race
for
some
reason
we
ca
understand
it
seems
to
be
on
the
skids
that
just
figurative
maybe
it
dying
out
maybe
it
wants
to
pack
up
and
leave
the
galaxy
altogether
maybe
got
other
undreamed
of
business
other
undreamed
of
places
anyway
it
wants
out
but
it
got
an
storehouse
of
culture
and
maybe
it
figures
someone
ought
to
have
access
to
that
and
keep
the
galaxy
in
running
order
but
who
that
the
problem
who
gets
all
this
information
a
million
million
generations
of
scientific
problems
all
carefully
worked
out
who
among
all
the
parallel
races
on
all
the
worlds
of
the
universe
that
quite
a
problem
even
for
our
super
race
boys
you
think
they
have
ways
to
solve
it
though
with
calculating
machines
or
whatever
will
follow
calculating
machines
after
earthmen
and
all
the
others
find
the
next
faltering
step
after
a
few
thousand
years
or
with
plain
horse
sense
and
logic
developed
to
a
point
after
millions
of
years
at
it
where
it
never
fails
or
solve
the
problem
with
something
we
never
heard
of
but
solve
it
anyway
what
all
this
got
to
do
with
i
mean
it
an
interesting
story
and
when
i
get
a
chance
to
digest
it
i
probably
start
gasping
but
what
about
nowhere
and
i
coming
to
that
kit
what
would
you
say
if
i
told
you
that
the
most
intelligent
race
the
universe
has
ever
produced
solves
the
biggest
problem
ever
handed
anyone
by
playing
games
i
say
you
better
continue
that
the
purpose
of
nowhere
kit
every
planet
every
race
has
its
nowhere
we
all
come
here
and
we
play
games
planet
with
the
highest
score
at
the
end
of
god
knows
how
long
wins
the
universe
with
all
the
science
and
the
wisdom
needed
to
fashion
that
universe
into
a
dozen
different
kinds
of
heaven
and
to
decide
all
this
we
play
games
do
get
the
wrong
idea
i
not
complaining
if
the
superboys
say
we
play
then
we
play
i
take
their
word
for
it
if
they
told
me
i
had
fifteen
heads
but
it
the
sort
of
thing
which
does
let
you
get
much
sleep
oh
earth
has
a
right
to
be
proud
of
its
record
united
north
america
is
in
second
place
on
a
competition
that
as
wide
as
the
universe
but
we
not
first
second
and
i
have
a
hunch
from
been
going
on
around
here
that
the
games
are
drawing
to
a
close
fantastic
is
it
out
of
thousands
of
entrants
we
good
enough
to
place
second
but
some
planet
out
near
the
star
deneb
has
us
hopelessly
outclassed
we
might
as
well
get
the
booby
prize
win
and
own
the
universe
us
included
jason
had
leaned
forward
as
he
spoke
and
was
sitting
on
the
edge
of
his
chair
now
the
room
was
comfortably
cool
but
sweat
beaded
his
forehead
dripped
from
his
chin
temple
lit
another
cigarette
inhaling
deeply
you
said
the
united
states
north
america
was
second
i
thought
this
was
a
competition
planet
against
planet
earth
is
the
one
exception
i
been
able
to
find
the
deneb
planet
heads
the
list
then
comes
north
america
after
that
the
planet
of
a
star
i
never
heard
of
in
fourth
place
is
the
soviet
union
i
be
damned
said
temple
well
okay
mind
if
i
store
that
away
for
future
reference
i
got
another
question
what
kind
of
uh
games
do
we
play
you
name
it
mental
contests
scientific
problems
to
be
worked
out
with
laboratories
built
to
our
specifications
emotional
problems
with
scores
of
men
driven
neurotic
or
worse
every
year
problems
of
adaptability
responses
to
environmental
challenge
stamina
contests
tests
of
strength
of
endurance
tests
to
determine
depths
of
emotion
tests
to
determine
objectivity
in
what
should
be
an
objective
situation
but
the
way
everything
is
organized
it
almost
like
a
never
ending
olympic
games
complete
with
some
cockeyed
sports
events
too
by
the
way
with
all
the
pageantry
too
no
but
that
another
story
anyway
what
i
saw
a
and
sorry
jase
but
i
have
another
question
jason
shrugged
spread
his
hands
wide
how
come
all
this
talk
about
rotation
it
is
possible
not
with
a
fifty
century
gap
i
know
they
just
let
us
in
on
that
little
deal
a
couple
of
years
ago
till
then
we
did
know
we
thought
it
was
distance
only
in
time
after
all
this
was
over
we
could
go
home
that
what
we
thought
jason
said
bitterly
actually
it
twice
five
thousand
years
five
to
come
here
five
to
return
ten
thousand
years
separate
us
from
the
earth
we
know
and
even
if
we
could
go
home
that
would
be
going
home
at
all
to
earth
ten
thousand
years
in
the
future
oh
they
had
us
hoodwinked
afraid
we
might
say
no
or
something
they
never
mentioned
the
length
or
duration
of
the
trip
i
do
understand
it
none
of
us
do
and
we
have
some
top
scientists
here
something
to
do
with
suspended
animation
with
matter
with
teleportation
something
about
latent
powers
in
everyone
about
the
ability
to
break
down
an
object
or
a
creature
or
a
man
to
its
component
atoms
to
reverse
that
the
word
reverse
those
atoms
and
send
them
spinning
off
into
space
as
matter
it
all
boils
down
to
putting
a
man
in
a
machine
on
mars
pulling
a
lever
materializing
him
here
five
thousand
years
later
jason
smiled
with
only
a
trace
of
humor
any
questions
about
a
thousand
said
temple
i
something
buzzed
on
jason
desk
and
temple
watched
him
pick
up
a
microphone
say
speaking
what
up
the
voice
which
answered
clear
enough
to
be
in
the
room
with
them
and
without
the
faintest
trace
of
mechanical
or
electrical
transfer
spoke
in
a
strange
language
temple
had
never
heard
jason
responded
in
the
same
language
with
an
apparent
ease
which
surprised
temple
until
he
remembered
that
his
brother
had
always
had
a
knack
of
picking
up
foreign
languages
maybe
that
was
why
he
held
the
job
whatever
it
was
he
there
was
fluency
in
the
way
jason
spoke
and
alarm
the
etched
deeply
on
his
face
stood
out
sharply
his
eyes
if
possible
grew
more
intense
well
he
said
putting
the
mike
down
and
staring
at
temple
without
seeing
him
i
afraid
that
does
it
what
the
trouble
everything
anything
i
can
do
item
the
superboys
have
discovered
that
earth
has
two
contingents
here
us
and
the
soviets
they
mad
item
something
will
be
done
about
it
item
soviet
russia
has
made
a
suggestion
or
that
is
its
people
here
they
will
put
forth
a
champion
to
match
one
of
our
own
choosing
in
the
toughest
grind
of
all
something
to
do
with
responding
to
environmental
challenge
which
does
mean
a
hell
of
a
lot
unless
you
happen
to
know
something
about
it
shall
i
go
on
and
when
temple
nodded
avidly
we
automatically
lose
by
default
one
of
the
rules
of
that
particular
game
is
that
the
contestant
must
be
a
newcomer
it
the
sort
of
game
you
have
to
know
nothing
about
and
incidentally
it
also
the
sort
of
game
a
man
can
get
killed
at
well
the
soviets
have
a
whole
contingent
of
newcomers
to
pick
from
we
have
any
as
the
superboys
see
it
that
our
own
tough
luck
we
lose
by
default
it
seems
to
me
how
can
anything
to
you
you
new
here
i
sorry
kit
what
were
you
saying
no
go
ahead
that
only
the
half
of
it
right
after
russia
takes
our
place
and
we
scratched
off
the
list
the
games
go
into
their
final
phase
that
was
the
rumor
all
along
and
it
just
been
confirmed
interesting
to
see
what
they
do
with
all
the
contestants
the
games
are
over
after
there
no
more
nowhere
journey
we
could
go
back
where
we
came
from
ten
thousand
years
in
the
future
i
not
afraid
well
anyway
the
soviets
put
up
a
man
we
ca
match
him
so
it
looks
like
the
represents
earth
officially
not
that
it
matters
we
hardly
have
the
chance
of
a
very
slushy
snowball
in
a
very
hot
hell
but
still
our
contestant
this
guy
who
meets
the
russians
challenge
has
to
be
a
newcomer
that
what
i
said
well
we
can
close
up
shop
i
guess
you
made
a
mistake
you
said
no
newcomers
have
arrived
i
here
jase
i
your
man
bring
on
your
russian
bear
temple
smiled
grimly
chapter
viii
you
got
to
hand
it
to
temple
kid
brother
yeah
cool
as
ice
cubes
are
you
guys
kidding
he
does
know
what
in
store
for
him
all
do
now
that
you
mention
it
no
is
a
man
here
who
can
say
for
sure
what
kind
of
environmental
challenges
he
have
to
respond
to
sees
to
it
the
guys
who
went
through
the
thing
wo
talk
about
it
as
if
that
is
security
enough
the
subject
got
to
be
a
brand
new
arrival
shh
here
he
comes
the
brothers
temple
entered
earth
city
one
tavern
quietly
but
on
their
arrival
all
the
speculative
talk
subsided
the
long
bar
built
to
accommodate
half
a
hundred
pairs
of
elbows
comfortably
gleamed
with
a
luster
unfamiliar
to
temple
it
might
have
been
marble
but
marble
translucent
rather
than
opaque
giving
a
beautiful
effect
to
the
surface
patterns
what
will
it
be
jason
demanded
whatever
you
drinking
is
fine
jason
ordered
two
scotches
neat
and
the
brothers
drank
when
jason
got
a
refill
he
started
talking
does
mean
anything
to
you
kit
tat
umm
no
wait
a
minute
is
that
some
kind
of
protective
psychological
test
that
it
you
shown
a
couple
of
dozen
pictures
more
or
less
ambiguous
never
cut
and
dry
each
one
comes
from
a
different
stratum
of
the
social
environment
and
you
told
to
create
a
dramatic
situation
a
story
for
each
picture
from
your
stories
for
which
you
draw
on
your
whole
background
as
a
human
being
the
psychometrician
should
be
able
to
build
a
picture
of
your
personality
and
maybe
find
out
what
if
anything
is
bothering
you
what
that
to
do
with
this
response
to
environmental
challenge
thing
well
said
jason
drinking
a
third
scotch
the
super
boys
have
evolved
to
its
ultimate
that
stands
for
thematic
apperception
test
but
in
environmental
challenge
and
response
you
do
see
a
picture
and
create
a
dramatic
story
around
it
instead
you
get
thrust
into
the
picture
the
situation
and
you
have
to
work
out
the
solution
or
suffer
whatever
consequences
the
particular
environmental
challenge
has
in
store
for
you
i
think
i
get
you
but
it
all
make
believe
huh
that
the
hell
of
it
jason
told
him
no
it
not
it
is
and
it
is
i
do
know
you
make
it
perfectly
clear
temple
smiled
the
boy
combed
his
brown
hair
wishing
it
were
blond
jason
shrugged
i
sorry
for
reasons
you
already
know
the
is
very
clear
to
me
or
to
anyone
you
not
actually
in
the
situation
in
a
physical
sense
but
it
can
affect
you
physically
you
you
there
you
actually
live
everything
that
happens
to
you
getting
injured
if
an
injury
occurs
and
dying
if
you
get
killed
it
permanent
although
you
might
actually
be
sleeping
at
the
time
so
whether
it
real
or
not
is
a
question
for
philosophy
from
your
point
of
view
from
the
point
of
view
of
someone
going
through
it
it
real
so
i
become
part
of
this
uh
game
in
about
an
hour
right
you
and
whoever
the
russians
offer
as
your
competition
no
one
will
blame
you
if
you
want
to
back
out
kit
from
what
you
tell
me
you
have
even
been
adequately
trained
on
mars
if
you
draw
on
the
entire
background
of
your
life
for
this
then
you
do
need
training
shut
up
and
stop
worrying
i
not
backing
out
of
anything
i
did
think
you
would
not
if
you
still
as
much
like
your
old
man
as
you
used
to
be
kit
good
luck
the
fact
that
the
technicians
working
around
him
were
earthmen
permitted
temple
to
relax
a
little
probably
it
was
planned
that
way
for
entering
the
huge
white
cube
of
a
building
and
ascending
to
the
twelfth
level
on
a
moving
ramp
temple
had
spotted
many
figures
not
all
of
them
human
if
he
had
been
strapped
to
the
table
by
unfamiliar
aliens
if
the
scent
of
alien
flesh
or
had
been
strong
in
the
room
if
the
fingers
or
appendages
which
greased
his
temples
and
clamped
an
electrode
to
each
one
had
not
felt
like
human
fingers
if
the
men
talking
to
him
had
spoken
in
voices
too
harsh
or
too
sibilant
for
human
vocal
chords
if
all
that
had
been
the
case
whatever
composure
still
remained
his
would
have
vanished
i
olson
said
one
figure
if
any
injuries
occur
while
you
lie
here
i
permitted
to
render
first
aid
the
same
for
limited
psychotherapy
said
a
shorter
heavier
man
though
a
fat
lot
of
good
it
does
when
we
never
know
what
bothering
you
and
do
have
the
time
to
work
on
it
even
if
we
did
know
in
short
said
a
third
man
who
failed
to
identify
himself
you
may
consider
yourself
as
the
driver
of
one
of
those
midget
rocket
racers
do
they
still
have
them
on
earth
good
you
are
the
driver
and
we
here
in
this
room
are
the
mechanics
waiting
in
your
pit
if
anything
goes
wrong
you
can
pull
out
of
the
race
temporarily
and
have
it
repaired
but
in
this
particular
race
there
is
no
pulling
out
all
repairs
are
strictly
of
a
nature
and
must
be
done
while
you
continue
whatever
you
are
doing
if
you
break
your
finger
and
find
a
splint
appearing
on
it
miraculously
do
say
you
were
warned
best
of
luck
to
you
young
man
said
the
psychotherapist
here
we
go
said
the
doctor
finding
the
large
vein
on
the
inside
of
temple
forearm
and
plunging
a
needle
into
it
temple
senses
whirled
instantly
but
as
his
vision
clouded
he
thought
he
saw
a
large
complex
device
swing
down
from
the
ceiling
and
bathe
his
head
in
warming
radiation
he
blinked
squinted
could
see
nothing
but
a
swirling
cloudy
opacity
approximately
two
seconds
later
sophia
androvna
petrovitch
watched
as
the
comrade
tied
a
rubber
strap
around
her
arm
waited
for
the
vein
to
swell
with
blood
then
forced
a
needle
in
through
its
thick
outer
layer
was
that
a
nozzle
overhead
no
rather
a
lens
for
from
it
came
amber
warmth
which
soon
faded
with
everything
else
into
thick
churning
fog
temple
was
abruptly
aware
of
running
plunging
headlong
and
blindly
through
the
fiercest
storm
he
had
ever
seen
gusts
of
wind
whipped
at
him
furiously
rain
cascaded
down
in
drenching
torrents
foliage
brambles
branches
struck
against
his
face
mud
sucked
at
his
feet
big
animal
shapes
lumbered
by
in
the
green
gloom
as
frightened
by
the
storm
as
was
temple
his
head
darted
this
way
and
that
his
eyes
could
see
the
gnarled
tree
trunks
the
dense
greenery
the
lianas
creepers
and
vines
of
a
tropical
rain
forest
but
dimly
green
murk
swirled
in
like
thick
smoke
with
every
gust
of
wind
with
the
rain
obscuring
vision
almost
completely
temple
ran
until
his
lungs
burned
and
he
thought
he
must
exhale
fire
his
leaden
feet
fought
the
mud
with
growing
difficulty
for
every
stride
he
took
he
ran
wildly
and
in
no
set
direction
convinced
only
that
he
must
find
shelter
or
perish
twice
he
crashed
bodily
into
trees
twice
stumbled
to
his
knees
only
to
pull
himself
upright
again
sucking
air
painfully
into
his
lungs
and
cutting
out
in
a
fresh
direction
he
ran
until
his
legs
balked
he
fell
collapsing
first
at
the
knees
then
the
waist
then
flopping
face
down
in
the
mud
something
prodded
his
back
as
he
fell
and
reaching
behind
him
weakly
temple
was
aware
for
the
first
time
that
a
bow
and
a
quiver
of
arrows
hung
suspended
from
his
shoulders
by
a
strong
leather
thong
he
wore
nothing
but
a
loin
cloth
of
some
nameless
animal
skin
and
he
wondered
idly
if
he
had
slain
the
animal
with
the
weapon
he
carried
yet
when
he
tried
to
recollect
he
found
he
could
not
he
remembered
nothing
but
his
frantic
flight
through
the
rain
forest
as
if
all
his
life
he
had
run
in
a
futile
attempt
to
leave
the
rain
behind
him
now
as
he
lay
there
the
mud
sucking
at
his
legs
his
chest
his
armpits
he
could
not
even
remember
his
name
did
he
have
one
did
he
have
a
life
before
the
rain
forest
then
why
did
he
forget
a
sense
not
fully
developed
in
man
and
called
intuition
by
those
who
fail
to
understand
it
made
him
prop
his
head
up
on
his
hands
and
squint
through
the
downpour
there
was
something
off
there
in
the
foliage
someone
a
woman
temple
breath
caught
in
his
throat
sharply
the
woman
stood
half
a
dozen
paces
off
observing
him
coolly
with
hands
on
flanks
she
stood
tall
and
straight
despite
the
storm
and
from
trim
ankles
to
long
lithe
legs
to
flaring
hips
to
supple
waist
and
tawny
skin
of
fine
bare
breasts
and
shoulders
to
proud
haughty
face
and
long
dark
hair
loose
in
the
storm
and
glistening
with
rain
she
was
magnificent
her
long
bronzed
body
gleamed
with
wetness
and
temple
realized
she
was
tall
as
he
a
wild
beautiful
goddess
of
the
jungle
she
was
part
of
the
storm
and
he
accepted
her
but
strangely
with
the
same
fear
the
storm
evoked
she
would
make
a
lover
the
whole
world
might
relish
what
world
temple
thought
in
confusion
but
she
would
make
a
terrible
foe
and
foe
she
was
i
want
your
bow
and
arrows
she
told
him
temple
wanted
to
suggest
they
share
the
weapon
but
somehow
he
knew
in
this
world
which
was
like
a
dream
and
could
tell
him
things
the
way
a
dream
would
and
yet
was
vividly
real
that
the
woman
would
share
nothing
with
anybody
they
are
mine
temple
said
climbing
to
his
knees
he
remembered
the
lumbering
by
in
the
storm
and
he
knew
that
he
and
the
animals
would
both
stalk
prey
when
the
storm
subsided
and
he
would
need
the
bow
and
arrows
the
woman
moved
toward
him
with
a
liquid
motion
beautiful
to
behold
and
for
the
space
of
a
heartbeat
temple
watched
her
come
i
will
take
them
she
said
temple
was
sure
if
she
could
or
not
and
although
she
was
a
woman
he
feared
her
strangely
again
it
was
as
if
something
in
this
could
tell
him
more
than
he
should
know
making
up
his
mind
temple
sprang
to
his
feet
whirled
about
and
ran
he
was
plunging
through
the
wild
storm
once
more
blinded
by
the
occasional
flashes
of
jagged
green
lightning
deafened
by
the
peals
of
thunder
which
followed
and
he
was
being
pursued
minutes
hours
more
than
hours
for
an
eternity
temple
ran
a
reservoir
of
strength
he
never
knew
he
possessed
provided
the
energy
for
each
painful
step
and
running
through
the
storm
seemed
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
to
him
but
there
came
a
time
when
his
strength
failed
not
slowly
but
with
shocking
suddenness
temple
fell
crawled
a
ways
was
still
it
took
him
minutes
to
realize
the
storm
no
longer
buffeted
him
more
minutes
to
learn
he
had
managed
to
crawl
into
a
cave
he
had
no
time
to
congratulate
himself
on
his
good
fortune
for
something
stirred
outside
i
am
coming
in
the
woman
called
to
him
from
the
green
murk
temple
strung
an
arrow
to
his
bow
pulled
the
string
back
and
faced
the
cave
entrance
squatting
on
his
heels
then
your
first
step
shall
be
your
last
i
shoot
to
kill
and
he
meant
it
silence
from
outside
deafening
temple
felt
sweat
streaming
under
his
armpits
his
hands
were
clammy
his
hands
trembled
you
have
seen
the
last
of
me
the
woman
promised
after
that
temple
knew
she
was
gone
he
slept
as
one
dead
when
temple
awoke
bright
sunlight
filtered
in
through
the
foliage
outside
his
cave
although
the
ground
was
a
muddy
ruin
the
storm
had
stopped
edging
to
the
mouth
of
the
cave
temple
spread
the
foliage
with
his
hands
peered
cautiously
outside
satisfied
he
took
his
bow
and
arrows
and
left
the
cave
pangs
of
hunger
knotting
his
stomach
painfully
the
cave
had
been
weathered
in
the
side
of
a
short
steep
abutment
a
dozen
paces
from
a
gushing
swollen
stream
temple
followed
the
course
of
the
stream
as
it
twisted
through
the
jungle
ranging
half
a
mile
from
his
cave
until
the
water
course
widened
to
form
a
all
morning
temple
waited
there
crouching
in
the
grass
until
one
by
one
the
forest
animals
came
to
drink
he
selected
a
small
thing
notched
an
arrow
to
his
bow
let
it
fly
the
animal
jumped
collapsed
began
to
slink
away
into
the
undergrowth
dragging
the
arrow
from
its
hindquarters
temple
darted
after
it
caught
it
in
his
hands
and
bashed
its
life
out
against
the
bole
of
a
tree
returning
to
his
cave
he
found
two
flinty
stones
shredded
a
fallen
branch
and
nursed
the
shards
dry
in
the
strong
sunlight
soon
he
made
a
fire
and
ate
in
the
days
which
followed
temple
returned
to
the
and
bagged
a
new
catch
every
time
he
ventured
forth
things
went
so
well
that
he
began
to
range
further
and
further
from
his
cave
exploring
once
however
he
returned
early
to
the
and
found
footprints
in
the
soft
mud
of
its
banks
the
woman
that
she
had
been
observing
him
while
he
had
hunted
had
never
occurred
to
temple
but
now
that
the
proof
lay
clearly
before
his
eyes
the
old
feeling
of
uncertainty
came
back
and
the
next
day
when
he
crept
stealthily
to
the
and
saw
the
woman
squatting
there
in
the
brush
waiting
for
him
he
fled
back
to
his
cave
the
thought
hit
him
suddenly
if
she
were
stalking
him
why
must
he
flee
as
from
his
own
shadow
there
would
be
no
security
for
either
of
them
until
either
one
or
the
other
were
gone
and
gone
meant
dead
then
temple
would
do
his
own
stalking
for
several
nights
temple
hardly
slept
he
could
have
found
the
blindfolded
merely
by
following
the
stream
each
night
he
would
reach
the
hole
and
work
digging
with
a
sharp
stone
until
he
had
fashioned
a
pit
fully
ten
feet
deep
and
six
feet
across
this
he
covered
with
branches
twigs
leaves
and
finally
dirt
when
he
returned
in
the
morning
he
was
satisfied
with
his
work
unless
the
woman
made
a
careful
study
of
the
area
she
would
never
see
the
pit
all
that
day
temple
waited
with
his
back
to
the
facing
the
camouflaged
pit
the
trap
he
had
set
but
the
woman
failed
to
appear
when
she
also
did
not
come
on
the
second
day
he
began
to
think
his
plan
would
not
work
the
third
day
temple
arrived
with
the
sun
sat
as
before
in
the
tall
grass
between
the
pit
and
the
and
waited
several
paces
beyond
his
hidden
trap
he
could
see
the
tall
trees
of
the
jungle
with
vines
and
creepers
hanging
from
their
branches
at
his
back
a
length
behind
him
was
the
its
deepest
waters
no
more
than
temple
waited
until
the
sun
stood
high
in
the
sky
then
was
fascinated
as
a
small
antelope
minced
down
to
the
for
a
drink
make
a
fine
breakfast
tomorrow
he
thought
something
that
strange
sixth
sense
again
made
temple
turn
around
and
stand
up
he
had
time
for
a
brief
look
a
hoarse
cry
the
woman
had
been
the
cleverer
she
had
set
the
final
trap
she
stood
high
up
on
a
branch
of
one
of
the
trees
beyond
the
hidden
pit
and
for
an
instant
temple
saw
her
fine
figure
clearly
naked
but
for
the
loincloth
then
the
soft
curves
became
the
woman
arched
her
body
there
on
the
high
branch
grasping
a
stout
vine
and
rocking
back
with
it
temple
raised
his
bow
set
an
arrow
to
let
it
fly
but
by
then
the
woman
was
in
motion
long
and
lithe
and
graceful
she
swung
down
on
her
vine
gathering
momentum
as
she
came
her
feet
almost
brushed
the
lip
of
temple
pit
at
the
lowest
arc
of
her
flight
but
she
clung
to
the
vine
and
it
began
to
swing
up
again
like
a
pendulum
toward
temple
at
the
last
moment
he
hunched
his
shoulder
and
tried
to
raise
his
arms
for
protection
the
woman
was
quicker
she
gathered
her
legs
up
under
her
still
clutching
the
vine
with
her
slim
strong
hands
the
arc
carried
her
up
at
him
her
knees
were
at
a
level
with
his
head
and
she
brought
them
up
savagely
close
together
striking
temple
brutally
at
the
base
of
his
jaw
temple
screamed
as
his
head
was
jerked
back
with
terrible
force
the
bow
flew
from
his
fingers
and
he
fell
into
the
flat
on
his
back
sophia
let
the
vine
carry
her
out
over
the
water
then
dropped
from
it
waist
deep
she
waded
to
where
the
man
lay
unconscious
on
his
back
half
in
half
out
of
the
shallowest
part
of
the
water
she
reached
him
prodded
his
chest
with
her
foot
when
he
did
not
stir
she
rocked
her
weight
down
gracefully
on
her
long
leg
forcing
his
head
under
water
with
a
haughty
smile
she
watched
the
bubbles
rise
in
the
small
room
where
temple
body
lay
in
repose
on
a
table
the
doctor
looked
at
the
psychotherapist
questioningly
what
happening
ca
tell
doctor
but
suddenly
temple
still
body
rocked
convulsively
his
neck
stretched
his
head
shot
up
and
back
blood
trickled
from
his
mouth
the
doctor
thrust
out
expert
hands
examined
temple
jaw
dexterously
broken
the
psychotherapist
demanded
in
a
worried
voice
no
dislocated
he
looks
like
he
been
hit
by
a
sledge
hammer
wherever
he
is
now
whatever
happening
this
is
the
damndest
thing
temple
still
form
shuddered
convulsively
he
began
to
gasp
and
cough
obviously
fighting
for
breath
an
ugly
blue
swelling
had
by
now
lumped
the
base
of
his
jaw
what
happening
demanded
the
psychotherapist
i
ca
be
sure
said
the
doctor
shaking
his
head
he
seems
to
have
difficulty
in
breathing
it
as
if
he
were
drowning
bad
anything
we
can
do
no
we
wait
until
this
particular
sequence
ends
the
doctor
examined
temple
again
if
it
does
end
soon
this
man
will
die
of
asphyxiation
call
it
off
the
psychotherapist
pleaded
if
he
dies
now
earth
will
be
represented
by
russia
call
it
off
someone
entered
the
room
have
the
authority
he
said
selecting
a
hypodermic
from
the
doctor
rack
and
piercing
the
skin
of
forearm
with
it
this
first
test
has
gone
far
enough
the
russian
entry
is
clearly
the
winner
but
temple
must
live
if
he
is
to
compete
in
another
the
racking
convulsions
which
shook
temple
body
subsided
he
ceased
his
choking
began
to
breathe
regularly
with
grim
swiftness
the
doctor
went
to
work
on
temple
dislocated
jaw
while
the
man
who
had
stopped
the
contest
rendered
artificial
respiration
the
man
was
alaric
arkalion
the
comrade
doctor
was
exultant
jupiter
training
comrade
has
given
us
a
victory
how
can
you
be
sure
our
entrant
is
unharmed
the
contest
has
been
called
wait
she
is
coming
to
sophia
stretched
rubbed
her
bruised
knees
sat
up
what
happened
comrade
the
doctor
demanded
my
knees
ache
said
sophia
rubbing
them
some
more
i
i
killed
him
i
think
strange
i
never
dreamed
it
would
be
that
real
in
a
sense
it
real
if
you
killed
the
american
he
will
stay
dead
nothing
mattered
but
that
world
we
were
in
a
fantastic
place
now
i
remember
everything
all
the
things
i
could
remember
then
but
your
ah
dream
what
happened
sophia
rubbed
her
bruised
knees
a
third
time
ruefully
i
knocked
him
unconscious
with
these
i
forced
his
head
under
water
and
drowned
him
but
before
i
could
be
sure
i
finished
the
job
i
came
back
funny
that
i
should
want
to
kill
him
without
compunction
without
reason
sophia
frowned
sat
up
i
do
think
i
want
anymore
of
this
the
doctor
surveyed
her
coldly
this
is
your
task
on
the
stalintrek
this
you
will
do
i
killed
him
without
a
thought
enough
you
will
rest
and
get
ready
for
the
second
contest
but
if
he
dead
apparently
he
not
or
we
would
have
been
informed
comrade
petrovitch
that
is
true
agreed
the
second
man
who
had
remained
silent
until
now
prepare
for
another
test
comrade
sophia
was
on
the
point
of
arguing
again
after
all
it
was
fair
if
in
the
which
were
not
dream
worlds
she
was
motivated
by
but
one
factor
and
that
to
destroy
the
american
and
if
she
faced
him
with
the
strength
of
her
jupiter
training
it
would
hardly
be
a
contest
and
now
that
she
could
think
of
the
american
without
the
hatred
the
dream
world
had
fostered
in
her
she
realized
he
had
been
a
young
man
quite
personable
in
fact
could
like
sophia
thought
and
hoped
fervently
she
had
not
drowned
him
still
if
she
had
volunteered
for
the
stalintrek
and
this
was
the
job
they
assigned
her
i
need
no
rest
she
told
the
doctor
hardly
trusting
herself
for
she
realized
she
might
change
her
mind
i
am
ready
any
time
you
are
chapter
ix
his
name
was
temple
and
it
was
the
year
christopher
temple
had
problems
he
had
his
own
life
too
which
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
life
of
the
real
christopher
temple
departed
years
later
on
the
nowhere
journey
or
rather
this
christopher
temple
living
his
second
temple
who
had
lost
once
and
who
if
he
lost
again
would
take
the
dreams
and
hopes
of
the
western
world
down
into
the
dust
of
defeat
with
him
but
as
the
fictional
although
in
a
certain
sense
real
christopher
temple
of
he
knew
nothing
of
this
the
world
could
go
to
pot
the
world
was
going
to
pot
anyway
temple
shuddered
as
he
poured
a
fourth
canadian
downing
it
in
a
tasteless
burning
gulp
temple
was
a
engineer
with
government
subsidized
degrees
from
three
universities
including
the
fine
new
one
at
desert
rock
temple
was
a
engineer
with
government
clearance
temple
was
a
engineer
with
more
military
secrets
buzzing
around
inside
his
head
than
in
a
warehouse
of
burned
pentagon
files
temple
was
also
a
engineer
whose
wife
spied
for
the
russians
he
found
out
quite
by
accident
not
meaning
to
eavesdrop
at
all
returning
home
early
one
afternoon
because
the
production
engineer
called
a
halt
while
further
research
was
done
on
certain
unstable
isotopes
temple
was
surprised
to
find
his
wife
had
a
gentleman
caller
he
heard
their
voices
clearly
from
where
he
stood
out
in
the
and
for
a
ridiculous
instant
he
was
torn
between
slinking
upstairs
and
ignoring
them
altogether
or
barging
into
the
living
room
like
a
high
school
boy
flushed
with
jealousy
the
mature
thing
to
do
of
course
was
neither
and
temple
was
on
the
point
of
walking
politely
into
the
living
room
saying
hello
and
waiting
for
an
introduction
when
snatches
of
the
conversation
stopped
him
cold
silly
charles
kit
does
suspect
a
thing
i
would
how
can
you
be
sure
intuition
on
a
framework
of
intuition
you
would
place
the
fate
of
red
empire
empire
charles
temple
could
picture
lucy
raised
eyebrow
he
listened
now
hardly
breathing
for
one
wild
moment
he
thought
he
would
retreat
upstairs
and
forget
the
whole
thing
life
would
be
much
simpler
that
way
a
meaningless
surrender
to
unreality
however
and
it
could
be
done
yes
empire
oh
not
the
sort
of
things
the
imperialists
used
to
attempt
but
a
more
subtle
and
hence
more
enduring
empire
let
the
world
call
us
liberator
we
shall
have
empire
lucy
laughed
a
sound
which
temple
loved
you
may
keep
your
ideology
charles
play
with
it
bathe
in
it
get
drunk
on
it
or
drown
yourself
in
it
i
want
my
money
you
are
frank
temple
could
picture
lucy
shrug
i
am
a
paid
professional
spy
by
now
you
have
most
of
the
information
you
need
i
shall
have
the
rest
tonight
i
see
you
in
hell
first
temple
cried
in
rage
stalking
into
the
room
and
almost
smiling
in
spite
of
the
situation
when
he
realized
how
melodramatic
his
words
must
sound
kit
kit
lucy
raised
hand
to
mouth
then
backed
away
flinching
as
if
she
had
been
struck
yeah
kit
a
political
cuckold
or
does
charles
get
other
services
from
you
as
well
kit
you
do
the
man
named
charles
motioned
for
silence
dapper
except
for
a
surly
pouting
mouth
he
was
a
head
shorter
than
either
temple
or
lucy
do
waste
your
words
sophia
temple
overheard
us
thought
temple
sophia
he
said
charles
nodded
coolly
the
real
temple
was
observed
studied
her
every
habit
and
whim
catalogued
by
experts
a
plastic
surgeon
a
psychologist
a
sociologist
a
linguist
a
whole
battery
of
experts
molded
sophia
here
into
a
new
temple
i
must
congratulate
them
for
you
never
suspected
lucy
temple
demanded
dully
reason
stood
suspended
in
a
limbo
of
objective
acceptance
and
subjective
disbelief
temple
was
eliminated
regrettable
because
we
do
deal
in
senseless
mayhem
but
necessary
temple
was
not
aware
of
leaving
limbo
until
he
felt
the
bruising
contact
of
his
knuckles
with
charles
jaw
the
short
man
toppled
fell
at
his
feet
get
up
temple
cried
then
changed
his
mind
and
tensed
himself
to
leap
upon
the
prone
figure
hold
it
charles
told
him
quietly
wiping
blood
from
his
lips
with
one
hand
drawing
an
automatic
from
his
pocket
with
the
other
better
freeze
temple
you
die
if
you
do
temple
froze
watched
charles
slither
away
across
the
green
carpet
until
safely
away
across
the
room
he
came
upright
groggily
he
turned
to
the
dead
lucy
double
what
do
you
think
sophia
i
do
know
we
could
get
out
of
here
probably
get
along
without
the
final
information
that
is
what
i
mean
naturally
we
never
receive
the
final
facts
i
mean
what
do
you
think
about
temple
sophia
said
she
did
know
left
alone
he
would
go
to
the
police
kidnapped
he
would
be
worse
than
useless
harmful
actually
for
the
authorities
would
suspect
something
even
worse
if
we
killed
him
the
point
is
we
do
want
the
authorities
to
think
temple
gave
information
to
anybody
gave
is
hardly
the
word
said
sophia
i
was
a
good
wife
but
also
a
good
gleaner
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
charles
you
bitch
temple
said
later
charles
told
the
woman
the
solution
is
this
sophia
we
must
kill
temple
but
it
must
look
like
suicide
sophia
frowned
in
pretty
concern
do
we
have
to
kill
him
what
the
matter
my
dear
have
you
been
playing
the
wifely
role
too
long
if
temple
stands
in
the
way
of
red
empire
temple
must
die
temple
edged
forward
said
charles
must
he
waved
the
automatic
and
temple
subsided
is
that
right
sophia
demanded
well
you
listen
to
me
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
your
red
empire
i
fled
the
iron
curtain
came
here
to
live
voluntarily
do
you
really
think
it
was
on
a
voluntary
basis
that
you
went
we
allowed
you
to
go
sophia
we
encouraged
it
that
way
the
job
of
our
technicians
was
all
the
simpler
whether
you
like
it
or
not
you
have
been
a
cog
in
the
machine
of
red
empire
i
still
do
see
why
he
has
to
die
leave
thinking
to
those
who
can
you
have
a
smile
a
body
a
certain
way
with
men
i
will
think
i
think
that
temple
should
die
i
do
sophia
said
we
delaying
needlessly
the
man
dies
and
charles
raised
his
automatic
sufficiently
irked
to
forget
his
suicide
plan
a
gap
of
eight
or
nine
feet
separated
the
two
men
it
might
as
well
have
been
infinity
and
it
would
be
soon
for
temple
he
saw
small
hand
tighten
about
the
automatic
saw
the
trigger
finger
grow
white
the
weapon
pointed
at
a
spot
just
above
his
navel
and
briefly
he
found
himself
wondering
what
it
would
feel
like
for
a
slug
to
rip
into
his
stomach
burning
a
path
back
to
his
spine
he
decided
to
make
the
gesture
at
least
if
he
could
do
no
more
he
would
jump
for
charles
sophia
beat
him
to
it
and
because
lucy
was
dead
and
sophia
looked
exactly
like
her
and
temple
could
not
quite
accept
the
fact
it
seemed
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
sophia
leaped
upon
charles
back
and
they
went
down
together
in
a
twisting
thrashing
tangle
of
arms
and
legs
temple
did
not
wait
for
an
invitation
he
launched
himself
down
after
them
and
then
things
began
to
happen
fast
sophia
rolled
clear
rose
to
her
hands
and
knees
panting
charles
sat
up
cursing
nursing
a
badly
scratched
face
temple
hurtled
at
him
stretched
him
on
his
back
again
began
to
pound
hard
fists
into
his
face
charles
did
not
have
the
automatic
neither
did
temple
something
exploded
against
the
back
of
temple
head
violently
throwing
him
off
charles
and
tumbling
him
over
dimly
he
saw
sophia
following
through
the
automatic
in
her
hand
butt
foremost
senses
reeled
he
tried
to
rise
succeeded
only
in
a
kind
of
shuddering
slither
before
he
subsided
he
wavered
between
consciousness
and
unconsciousness
heard
as
in
a
dream
snatches
of
conversation
shoot
him
shoot
him
shut
up
i
have
gun
go
to
hell
kill
only
way
my
way
is
different
out
of
here
discuss
later
feel
i
said
out
of
here
the
voices
became
a
meaningless
liquid
torrent
cascading
into
a
black
pit
now
temple
sat
with
a
a
third
full
of
canadian
in
his
hand
every
once
in
a
while
reaching
up
gingerly
to
explore
the
bruised
swelling
on
his
head
the
hair
which
covered
it
to
be
a
cuckold
was
one
thing
but
to
be
the
naive
political
pawn
sort
of
cuckold
who
is
not
a
cuckold
at
all
he
told
himself
is
far
worse
to
live
with
his
woman
eat
the
meals
she
cooked
for
him
talk
to
her
think
she
understood
him
sympathize
with
him
to
make
love
to
her
with
passion
while
she
responds
with
for
a
hundred
thousand
dollar
salary
was
suddenly
the
most
emasculating
thing
in
the
world
for
temple
he
had
not
thought
to
ask
how
long
it
had
been
going
on
better
perhaps
if
he
never
knew
and
somewhere
lost
in
the
maze
of
his
thoughts
was
the
grimmest
bleakest
reality
of
them
all
lucy
was
dead
lucy
dead
but
where
did
lucy
leave
off
where
did
sophia
begin
was
lucy
dead
that
night
they
returned
more
than
a
little
drunk
from
the
chamber
party
that
night
they
danced
in
the
living
room
until
dawn
obscured
the
stars
and
he
carried
lucy
upstairs
lucy
or
sophia
and
the
day
they
motored
to
the
lake
their
secret
lake
hardly
more
than
a
dammed
widened
stream
and
dreamed
of
the
things
they
could
do
when
the
cold
war
ended
lucy
or
sophia
had
he
ever
noticed
a
difference
in
the
way
cooked
in
the
way
she
spoke
the
way
she
let
him
make
love
to
her
he
thought
himself
into
a
headache
and
found
no
answers
this
way
at
least
the
loss
of
his
wife
was
not
as
traumatic
as
it
might
have
been
he
knew
not
when
she
died
or
how
and
in
fact
seemed
so
much
like
the
real
thing
that
he
did
not
know
where
he
could
stop
loving
and
start
hating
and
the
girl
the
russian
girl
had
saved
his
life
why
he
answer
that
one
either
unless
if
it
were
as
charles
suggested
sophia
had
studied
lucy
so
carefully
had
learned
her
likes
and
dislikes
her
wants
and
desires
had
memorized
and
practised
every
quirk
of
her
character
to
such
an
extent
that
sophia
was
lucy
in
essence
which
temple
thought
would
make
it
all
the
harder
to
seek
out
sophia
and
kill
her
that
was
the
answer
the
only
answer
temple
felt
a
dull
ache
where
his
heart
should
have
been
a
pressure
a
pounding
an
unpleasant
unfamiliar
lack
of
feeling
if
he
took
his
story
to
the
he
had
no
doubt
that
charles
sophia
and
whoever
else
worked
this
thing
with
them
would
be
caught
but
he
temple
would
find
himself
with
a
lifelong
unslakable
emotional
thirst
he
had
to
quench
it
now
and
then
feel
sorry
so
that
he
might
heal
he
had
to
quench
it
with
blood
alone
he
found
her
a
week
later
at
their
lake
he
had
looked
everywhere
and
had
about
given
up
almost
in
fact
ready
to
turn
his
story
over
to
the
police
but
he
had
to
think
and
their
lake
was
the
place
for
that
apparently
sophia
had
the
same
idea
temple
parked
on
the
highway
half
a
mile
from
their
lake
made
his
way
slowly
through
the
woods
golden
dappled
with
sunlight
he
heard
the
waters
gushing
merrily
heard
the
sounds
of
some
small
animal
rushing
off
through
the
woods
he
saw
sophia
she
lay
on
their
sunning
rock
in
shorts
and
halter
completely
relaxed
an
opened
magazine
face
down
on
the
rock
beside
her
a
pair
of
sunglasses
next
to
it
she
had
one
knee
up
one
leg
stretched
out
one
forearm
shielding
her
eyes
from
the
sun
one
arm
down
at
her
side
seeing
her
thus
temple
felt
the
pressure
of
his
automatic
in
its
holster
under
his
arm
he
could
draw
it
out
kill
her
before
she
was
aware
of
his
presence
would
that
make
him
feel
better
five
minutes
ago
he
would
have
said
yes
now
he
hesitated
kill
her
who
seemed
as
completely
lucy
as
he
was
temple
send
a
bullet
ripping
through
the
body
which
he
had
known
and
loved
or
the
body
that
had
seemed
so
much
like
it
he
had
failed
to
tell
the
difference
murder
lucy
no
he
said
aloud
her
name
is
sophia
the
girl
sat
up
startled
kit
she
said
lucy
you
ca
make
up
your
mind
either
she
smiled
just
like
lucy
dumbly
he
sat
down
next
to
her
on
the
rock
strong
sunlight
had
brought
a
fine
dew
of
perspiration
to
the
bronzed
skin
of
her
face
she
got
a
pack
of
cigarettes
out
from
under
the
magazine
lit
one
offered
it
to
temple
lit
another
and
smoked
it
where
do
we
go
from
here
she
wanted
to
know
i
you
came
to
kill
me
did
you
is
that
the
only
way
you
can
ever
feel
better
kit
i
he
was
going
to
deny
it
then
think
do
deny
it
please
she
reached
in
under
his
jacket
withdrawing
her
hand
with
the
automatic
in
it
here
she
said
giving
it
to
him
he
took
the
gun
hefted
it
let
it
fall
clattering
on
the
rock
listen
she
said
i
could
have
told
you
i
was
lucy
if
i
said
now
that
i
am
lucy
and
if
i
kept
on
saying
it
you
believe
me
believe
me
because
you
want
to
well
said
temple
i
am
not
lucy
lucy
is
dead
but
but
i
was
lucy
in
everything
but
being
lucy
i
thought
her
thoughts
dreamed
her
dreams
loved
her
loves
you
killed
her
no
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
that
she
was
killed
yes
not
by
me
kit
if
i
asked
you
when
lucy
stopped
and
when
i
began
could
you
tell
me
he
had
often
thought
about
that
no
he
said
truthfully
you
as
much
my
wife
as
she
was
she
clutched
at
his
hand
impulsively
then
when
he
failed
to
respond
she
withdrew
her
own
hand
then
then
i
lucy
if
i
am
lucy
in
every
way
lucy
never
died
you
betrayed
me
you
stood
by
while
murder
was
committed

are
guilty
of
espionage
lucy
loved
you
i
am
lucy
betrayed
me
for
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
for
the
chance

the
wintertime
watery
potato
soup
rags
for
clothing
swaggering
commissars
poverty
disease

said
bitterly

the
plant
and
continue
working
knowing
all
the
time
that
our
most
closely
guarded
secret

laughed

want
to
go
right
on
being
lucy
your
wife
temple
said
nothing
for
a
long
time
he
realized
now
he
could
not
kill
her
but
everything
else
she
suggested
tell
me
he
said
tell
me
how
long
have
you
been
lucy
you
got
to
tell
me
that
how
long
have
we
been
married
you
know
how
long
three
years
sophia
crushed
her
cigarette
out
on
the
rock
wiped
perspiration
tears
from
her
cheek
with
the
back
of
her
hand
you
have
never
known
anyone
but
me
in
your
marriage
bed
kit
you
you
lying
no
they
did
what
they
did
on
the
eve
of
your
marriage
i
have
been
your
wife
for
as
long
as
you
have
had
one
temple
head
whirled
it
had
been
a
quick
courtship
he
had
known
lucy
only
two
weeks
in
those
hectic
days
of
but
for
fourteen
brief
days
it
was
sophia
he
had
known
all
along
sophia
i
there
is
no
sophia
not
any
more
he
had
hardly
known
lucy
the
real
lucy
this
girl
here
was
his
wife
always
had
been
had
the
first
fourteen
days
with
lucy
been
anything
but
a
dream
he
was
sorry
lucy
had
died
but
the
lucy
he
had
thought
dead
was
sophia
very
much
alive
he
took
her
in
his
arms
almost
crushing
her
he
held
her
that
way
kissed
her
savagely
letting
passion
of
a
different
sort
take
the
place
of
murder
is
my
he
thought
and
awoke
on
his
white
pallet
in
nowhere
i
am
awake
said
temple
we
see
that
you
should
be
no
no
there
is
one
more
dream
temple
dozed
restfully
but
was
soon
aware
of
a
commotion
strangely
he
did
not
care
he
was
too
tired
to
open
his
eyes
anyway
let
whatever
was
going
to
happen
happen
he
wanted
his
sleep
but
the
voice
persisted
this
is
highly
irregular
you
came
in
here
once
and
i
did
you
a
favor
did
i
that
voice
is
familiar
temple
thought
well
yes
but
what
now
temple
record
is
now
one
and
one
in
the
second
sequence
he
was
the
victor
the
soviet
entry
had
to
extract
certain
information
from
him
and
turn
it
over
to
her
people
she
extracted
the
information
well
enough
but
somehow
temple
made
her
change
her
mind
the
information
never
went
anyplace
how
temple
managed
to
play
counterspy
i
know
but
he
played
it
and
won
that
fine
but
what
do
you
want
the
final
is
critical
the
voice
was
arkalion
how
critical
i
ca
tell
you
sufficient
though
if
you
know
that
you
lose
no
matter
how
temple
fares
if
the
russian
woman
defeats
temple
you
lose
naturally
let
me
finish
if
temple
defeats
the
russian
woman
you
also
lose
either
way
earth
is
the
loser
i
have
time
to
explain
what
you
would
understand
anyway
will
you
cooperate
you
did
save
temple
life
yes
all
right
the
third
dream
sequence
is
the
wrong
dream
the
wrong
contest
with
the
wrong
antagonist
at
the
wrong
time
when
a
far
more
important
contest
is
brewing
with
the
fate
of
earth
as
a
reward
for
the
victor
what
do
you
propose
i
will
arrange
temple
final
dream
but
if
he
disappears
from
this
room
do
be
alarmed
it
a
dream
of
a
different
sort
temple
know
it
until
the
dream
progresses
you
wo
know
it
until
everything
is
concluded
but
temple
will
fight
for
a
slave
or
a
free
earth
ca
you
tell
us
more
there
is
no
time
except
to
say
that
along
with
the
rest
of
the
galaxy
you
been
duped
the
nowhere
journey
is
a
grim
tragic
farce
awaken
kit
temple
awoke
into
what
he
thought
was
the
third
and
final
dream
strange
because
this
time
he
knew
where
he
was
and
why
knew
also
that
he
was
dreaming
even
remembered
vividly
the
other
two
dreams
stealth
said
arkalion
and
led
temple
through
long
corridors
they
finally
came
to
a
partially
open
door
and
paused
there
peering
within
temple
saw
a
room
much
like
the
one
he
had
left
with
two
figures
standing
anxiously
over
a
table
and
prone
on
the
table
was
sophia
whom
temple
had
loved
short
moments
before
in
his
second
dream
moments
years
never
except
in
a
dream
she
lovely
arkalion
whispered
i
know
like
himself
sophia
was
garbed
in
a
loose
jumper
and
slacks
stealth
said
arkalion
again
haste
arkalion
disappeared
well
temple
told
himself
what
now
at
least
in
the
other
dreams
i
was
thrust
so
completely
into
things
i
knew
what
to
do
he
rubbed
his
jaw
grimly
not
that
it
did
much
good
the
first
time
temple
poked
the
door
with
his
foot
pushing
it
open
the
two
figures
had
their
backs
to
him
leaned
intently
over
the
table
and
sophia
without
knowing
what
motivated
him
temple
leaped
into
the
room
grasped
the
nearer
figure
arm
whirled
him
around
startled
confusion
began
to
alter
the
man
coarse
features
but
his
face
went
slack
when
temple
fist
struck
his
jaw
with
terrible
strength
the
man
collapsed
the
second
man
turned
mouthing
a
stream
of
what
must
have
been
russian
invective
he
parried
temple
quick
blow
with
his
left
hand
crossing
his
own
right
fist
to
temple
face
and
almost
ending
the
fight
as
quickly
as
it
had
started
temple
went
down
in
a
heap
and
was
vaguely
aware
of
the
russian
booted
foot
hovering
over
his
face
he
reached
out
grabbed
the
boot
with
both
hands
twisted
the
man
screamed
and
fell
and
then
they
were
rolling
over
and
over
striking
each
other
with
fists
knees
elbows
gouging
butting
cursing
temple
found
the
russian
throat
closed
his
hands
around
it
applied
pressure
fists
pounded
his
face
nails
raked
him
but
slowly
he
succeeded
in
throttling
the
russian
when
temple
got
to
his
feet
trembling
the
russian
stared
blankly
at
the
ceiling
he
would
go
on
staring
that
way
until
someone
shut
his
eyes
not
questioning
the
incomprehensible
temple
knew
he
had
done
what
he
must
hardly
seeking
for
the
motive
he
could
not
find
he
lifted
the
unconscious
sophia
off
the
table
slung
her
long
form
across
his
shoulder
plodded
with
her
from
the
room
arkalion
had
said
haste
he
would
hurry
he
next
was
aware
of
a
spaceship
remembering
no
time
lag
he
simply
stood
in
the
ship
with
arkalion
and
sophia
he
knew
it
was
a
spaceship
because
he
had
been
in
one
before
and
although
the
sensation
of
weightlessness
was
not
present
they
were
in
deep
space
stars
you
never
see
through
an
obscuring
atmosphere
hung
suspended
in
the
viewports
not
flickering
against
the
plush
blackness
of
deep
space
phalanxes
and
legions
of
stars
without
numbers
in
such
wild
profusion
that
space
actually
seemed
three
dimensional
this
is
a
different
sort
of
dream
said
sophia
in
english
i
remember
i
remember
everything
kit
hello
he
felt
strangely
shy
became
mildly
angry
when
arkalion
hardly
tried
to
suppress
a
slight
snicker
well
that
second
dream
was
our
idea
temple
protested
once
there
we
acted
and
and
said
sophia
and
nothing
arkalion
told
them
you
have
time
this
is
a
spaceship
not
like
the
slow
bumbling
craft
your
people
use
to
reach
mars
or
jupiter
our
people
temple
demanded
not
yours
will
you
let
me
finish
light
is
a
laggard
crawler
by
comparison
with
the
drive
propelling
this
ship
temple
sophia
we
are
leaving
your
galaxy
altogether
is
that
a
fact
said
sophia
her
knowledge
telling
her
they
were
traveling
an
unthinkable
distance
for
some
final
contest
between
us
no
doubt
to
decide
whether
the
or
the
represents
earth
kit
i
l
love
you
but
but
russia
is
more
important
huh
no
i
did
say
that
all
my
training
has
been
along
those
lines
though
and
even
if
i
aware
it
is
indoctrination
the
fact
still
remains
if
your
country
is
truly
better
but
if
i
have
seen
your
country
only
through
the
eyes
of
pravda
how
can
i
i
do
know
kit
let
me
think
you
need
said
arkalion
smiling
if
the
two
of
you
would
let
me
get
on
with
it
you
see
this
particular
train
of
thought
is
meaningless
quite
meaningless
arkalion
cleared
his
throat
strange
but
i
have
much
the
same
problem
as
sophia
has
my
indoctrination
was
far
more
subtle
though
far
more
convincing
based
upon
eons
of
propaganda
methods
temple
sophia
those
who
initiated
the
nowhere
journey
for
hundreds
of
worlds
of
your
galaxy
did
so
with
a
purpose
i
know
to
decide
who
gets
their
vast
knowledge
wrong
to
find
suitable
hosts
in
a
relationship
which
is
hardly
symbiosis
really
out
and
out
parasitism
what
and
sophia
what
are
you
talking
about
the
sick
decadent
tired
old
creatures
you
consider
your
superiors
parasites
they
need
hosts
in
order
to
survive
their
old
hosts
have
been
milked
dry
have
become
too
highly
specialized
are
now
incapable
physically
or
emotionally
of
meeting
a
wide
variety
of
environmental
challenges
the
nowhere
journey
is
to
find
a
suitable
new
host
they
have
found
one
you
of
earth
i
do
understand
temple
said
remembering
the
glowing
accounts
of
the
he
had
been
given
by
his
brother
jason
i
just
get
it
how
can
we
be
duped
like
that
would
someone
have
figured
it
out
and
if
they
have
all
the
power
everyone
says
there
is
much
we
can
do
about
it
anyway
arkalion
scowled
darkly
then
write
earth
obituary
you
need
one
go
ahead
sophia
told
arkalion
there
more
you
want
to
say
all
right
temple
thought
is
correct
they
have
tremendous
power
that
is
why
you
could
be
duped
so
readily
but
their
power
is
not
concentrated
here
these
ships
are
an
extreme
rarity
for
the
no
longer
exists
five
ships
in
all
i
believe
hardly
enough
to
invade
a
planet
even
for
them
it
takes
them
thousands
of
years
to
get
here
otherwise
thousands
just
as
it
took
me
when
i
came
to
mars
and
earth
in
the
first
place
what
cried
temple
you
i
am
one
of
them
correct
i
suppose
you
would
call
me
a
subversive
but
i
have
made
up
my
mind
parasitism
is
unsatisfactory
when
the
maker
got
us
started
on
symbiosis
somewhere
along
the
line
evolution
took
a
wrong
turn
we
are
monsters
what
do
you
look
like
sophia
demanded
while
temple
stood
there
shaking
his
head
and
muttering
to
himself
you
could
see
me
i
am
afraid
i
was
the
representative
here
to
see
how
things
were
going
and
when
my
people
found
you
of
the
earth
divided
yourselves
into
two
camps
they
realized
they
had
been
considering
your
abilities
in
halves
put
together
you
are
probably
the
top
culture
of
your
galaxy
so
we
win
said
temple
right
and
wrong
you
lose
earthmen
will
become
hosts
know
what
a
driver
is
temple
you
would
be
a
back
seat
driver
in
your
own
body
thinking
feeling
wanting
to
make
decisions
but
unable
to
eating
when
the
parasite
wants
to
sleeping
at
his
command
fighting
loving
living
as
he
wills
it
and
perishing
when
he
wants
a
new
garment
oh
they
offer
something
in
return
their
culture
their
way
of
life
their
scientific
economic
social
system
it
good
too
but
not
worth
it
did
you
know
that
their
economic
struggle
between
democratic
capitalism
and
totalitarian
communism
ended
almost
half
a
million
years
ago
what
they
have
now
is
a
system
you
could
even
understand
well
temple
mused
even
if
everything
you
said
were
true
do
tell
me
you
do
believe
me
if
it
were
true
and
we
wanted
to
do
something
about
it
what
could
we
do
now
nothing
nothing
but
delay
things
by
striking
swiftly
and
letting
fifty
centuries
of
time
perform
your
rearguard
action
destroy
the
one
means
your
enemy
has
of
reaching
earth
within
foreseeable
time
and
you
have
destroyed
his
power
to
invade
for
a
hundred
centuries
he
can
still
reach
earth
but
the
same
way
you
journeyed
to
nowhere
ten
thousand
years
of
space
travel
in
suspended
animation
you
saw
me
that
way
once
temple
and
wondered
you
thought
i
was
dead
but
that
is
another
story
anyway
let
my
people
invade
your
planet
ten
thousand
years
hence
if
earth
takes
the
right
direction
if
democracy
and
free
thought
and
individual
enterprise
win
over
totalitarian
standardization
as
i
think
they
will
your
people
will
be
more
than
a
match
for
the
decadent
parasites
who
may
or
may
not
have
sufficient
initiative
to
cross
space
the
slow
way
and
attempt
invasion
in
ten
thousand
years
ten
thousand
said
temple
five
from
earth
to
nowhere
the
distance
to
my
home
is
far
greater
but
the
rate
of
travel
can
be
increased
ten
thousand
years
tell
me
temple
demanded
abruptly
is
this
a
dream
arkalion
smiled
yes
and
no
it
is
not
a
dream
like
the
others
because
i
assure
you
your
bodies
are
not
now
resting
on
a
pair
of
identical
white
tables
still
in
the
other
dreams
physical
things
could
happen
to
you
while
now
you
find
you
can
do
things
as
in
a
dream
for
example
neither
one
of
you
knows
the
intricacies
of
a
spaceship
yet
if
you
are
to
save
your
planet
you
must
know
the
operation
of
the
most
intricate
of
all
space
ships
a
giant
space
station
then
we
not
dreaming
asked
temple
i
never
said
that
consider
this
sequence
of
events
about
half
way
between
the
dream
stage
you
have
already
seen
and
reality
itself
remember
this
you
have
to
work
together
you
have
to
function
like
machines
you
will
be
handling
totally
alien
equipment
with
only
the
sort
of
knowledge
which
can
be
played
into
your
brains
to
guide
you
sophia
sighed
being
an
american
kit
is
too
much
of
an
individual
to
help
in
such
a
situation
temple
snorted
being
a
cog
in
a
simple
machine
is
one
thing
orienting
yourself
in
a
totally
new
situation
is
another
yes
well
see
arkalion
cautioned
see
already
you
are
arguing
but
you
must
work
together
completely
with
not
the
slightest
conflict
between
you
as
it
is
you
hardly
have
a
chance
what
about
you
said
sophia
practically
ca
you
help
arkalion
shook
his
head
no
while
i
like
to
see
you
come
out
of
this
thing
on
top
i
would
not
like
to
sacrifice
my
life
for
it
which
is
exactly
what
i
do
if
i
remained
with
you
and
you
lost
so
let
get
down
to
detail
imagine
space
being
folded
imagine
your
time
sense
slowing
imagine
a
new
dimension
which
negates
the
need
for
extensive
linear
travel
imagine
anything
you
want
but
we
are
in
the
process
of
moving
nine
hundred
thousand
light
years
through
deep
space
there
is
a
great
galaxy
at
that
distance
almost
a
twin
of
your
milky
way
you
call
it
the
andromeda
nebula
closer
to
your
own
system
are
the
two
magellanic
clouds
so
called
something
else
which
you
table
ngc
and
finally
the
triangulum
galaxy
all
have
billions
of
stars
but
none
of
the
stars
have
life
to
find
life
outside
your
galaxy
you
must
seek
it
across
almost
a
million
light
years
my
people
live
in
andromeda
guarding
the
flank
of
their
galaxy
and
speeding
through
space
at
many
light
years
per
minute
is
what
you
might
call
a
space
station
but
on
a
scale
you
never
dreamed
of
five
of
your
miles
in
diameter
it
is
a
fortress
of
terrible
strength
a
storehouse
of
half
a
million
years
of
weapon
development
it
has
been
arranged
that
the
one
man
running
this
station
just
one
temple
asked
yes
you
will
see
why
when
you
get
there
it
has
been
arranged
that
he
will
leave
ostensibly
on
a
scouting
expedition
you
see
i
am
not
alone
in
this
venture
at
any
rate
he
will
report
that
the
space
station
has
been
taken
as
indeed
it
will
be
by
the
two
of
you
the
only
ships
capable
of
overtaking
your
station
in
its
flight
will
be
the
only
ships
capable
of
reaching
your
galaxy
before
cultural
development
gives
you
a
chance
to
survive
they
will
attack
you
you
will
destroy
them
or
be
destroyed
yourselves
any
questions
the
whole
thing
sounded
fantastic
to
temple
could
the
fate
of
all
earth
rest
on
their
shoulders
in
a
totally
alien
environment
could
they
be
expected
to
win
temple
had
no
reason
to
doubt
the
former
as
wild
as
it
sounded
as
for
the
latter
all
he
could
do
was
hope
tell
me
he
said
how
will
we
learn
the
use
of
all
the
weapons
you
claim
are
at
our
disposal
can
you
answer
that
for
him
sophia
arkalion
wanted
to
know
umm
i
think
so
the
same
way
i
had
all
sorts
of
culture
crammed
into
me
on
jupiter
precisely
only
take
it
from
me
our
refinement
is
far
better
and
the
amount
you
have
to
learn
actually
is
less
what
i
like
to
know
sophia
began
forget
it
i
want
some
sleep
and
you
learn
everything
necessary
at
the
space
station
and
after
that
ply
arkalion
as
they
would
with
questions
he
slumped
down
in
his
chair
and
rested
temple
could
suddenly
understand
and
appreciate
he
felt
like
curling
up
into
a
tight
little
ball
himself
and
sleeping
until
everything
was
over
one
way
or
the
other
chapter
x
it
all
so
big
so
incredible
we
never
understand
it
never
relax
sophia
arkalion
said
i
know
what
arkalion
said
but
we
have
learned
anything
yet
hours
before
arkalion
had
landed
them
on
the
space
station
a
gleaming
in
diameter
globe
and
had
quickly
departed
soon
after
that
they
had
found
themselves
in
a
veritable
labyrinth
of
tunnels
passageways
vaults
occasionally
they
passed
a
great
glowing
screen
and
always
the
view
of
space
was
the
same
like
a
magnificent
elongated
shield
sparkling
with
a
million
million
points
of
light
pale
gold
burnished
copper
blue
of
glacial
ice
and
silver
white
the
andromeda
galaxy
spanned
space
from
upper
right
to
lower
left
off
at
the
lower
right
hand
corner
they
could
see
their
space
station
apparently
the
viewer
itself
stood
far
removed
in
space
projecting
its
images
here
at
the
globe
awed
the
first
time
they
had
seen
one
of
the
screens
temple
said
all
the
poets
who
ever
wrote
a
line
would
have
given
half
their
lives
to
see
this
as
we
see
it
now
and
all
the
writers
musicians
artists
anyone
who
ever
thought
creatively
sophia
how
can
you
say
breathtaking
or
anything
like
that
when
words
were
ever
spoken
which
can
let
not
go
poetic
just
yet
sophia
admonished
him
with
a
smile
we
better
get
squared
away
here
as
the
expression
goes
before
too
late
yes
hello
what
this
a
door
irised
open
for
them
in
a
solid
wall
of
metal
irised
was
the
only
word
temple
could
think
of
for
a
tiny
round
hole
appeared
in
the
wall
spreading
evenly
in
all
directions
with
a
slow
uniform
almost
liquid
motion
when
it
was
large
enough
to
walk
through
they
entered
a
completely
bare
room
and
temple
whirled
in
time
to
see
the
entrance
irising
shut
something
smells
said
sophia
sniffing
at
the
air
sweet
and
cloying
the
odor
grew
stronger
temple
may
have
heard
a
faint
hissing
sound
i
getting
sleepy
he
said
nodding
sophia
ran
banged
on
the
wall
where
the
door
had
opened
so
suddenly
then
closed
no
response
is
it
a
trap
by
whom
for
what
temple
found
it
difficult
to
keep
his
eyes
from
closing
fight
it
if
you
want
sophia
i
going
to
sleep
and
he
squatted
in
the
center
of
the
floor
staring
vacantly
at
the
bare
wall
just
as
temple
was
drifting
off
into
a
dream
about
complex
machinery
he
did
not
yet
understand
but
realized
he
soon
would
sophia
joined
him
the
hard
way
collapsing
alongside
of
him
unconscious
and
sprawling
gracelessly
on
the
floor
temple
slept
get
up
sophia
stirred
as
he
spoke
and
shook
her
she
yawned
stretched
smiled
up
at
him
lazily
how
do
you
feel
now
hungry
kit
that
a
point
it
all
right
now
though
i
know
exactly
where
the
food
concentrates
are
kept
three
levels
below
us
second
segment
of
the
wall
you
can
make
those
queer
doors
iris
by
pressing
the
wall
twice
with
about
a
one
second
interval
they
found
the
food
compartment
discovered
row
on
row
of
cans
boxes
jars
temple
opened
one
of
the
cans
gazed
in
disappointment
on
a
sorry
looking
thing
the
size
of
his
thumb
brown
shriveled
dry
and
almost
flaky
it
might
have
been
a
bird
sophia
turned
up
her
nose
if
that
the
best
this
place
has
to
offer
i
not
so
hungry
anymore
suddenly
she
gaped
so
did
temple
a
savory
odor
attracted
their
attention
steam
rising
from
the
small
can
added
to
their
interest
amazing
things
happened
to
the
withered
scrap
of
food
on
exposure
to
the
air
temple
barely
had
time
to
extract
it
from
the
can
burning
his
fingers
in
the
process
when
it
became
twice
the
can
size
it
grew
and
by
the
time
it
finished
it
was
as
savory
looking
a
five
pound
fowl
as
temple
had
ever
seen
roasted
steaming
hot
ready
to
eat
they
tore
into
it
with
savage
gusto
stephanie
should
see
me
now
temple
found
himself
saying
and
regretted
it
stephanie
who
that
a
girl
your
girl
what
the
difference
she
a
million
light
years
and
fifty
centuries
away
answer
me
yes
said
temple
wishing
he
could
change
the
subject
my
girl
he
had
thought
of
stephanie
in
a
long
time
perhaps
because
it
was
meaningless
to
think
of
someone
dead
fifty
centuries
now
that
the
thoughts
had
been
stirred
within
him
though
he
found
them
poignantly
pleasant
your
girl
and
you
would
marry
her
if
you
could
he
had
grown
attached
to
sophia
not
in
reality
but
in
the
second
of
their
dream
worlds
he
wished
the
memory
of
the
dream
had
not
lingered
for
it
disturbed
him
in
it
he
had
loved
sophia
as
much
as
he
now
loved
stephanie
although
the
one
was
obtainable
and
the
other
was
a
year
pinch
of
dust
and
how
much
of
the
dream
lingered
with
him
in
his
head
and
his
heart
let
forget
about
it
temple
suggested
no
if
she
were
here
today
and
if
everything
were
normal
would
you
marry
her
why
talk
about
what
ca
be
i
want
to
know
that
why
all
right
yes
i
would
i
would
marry
stephanie
oh
said
sophia
then
what
happened
in
the
dream
meant
nothing
we
were
two
different
people
temple
said
coolly
then
wished
he
had
for
it
was
only
he
remembered
everything
about
the
vividly
he
had
been
far
more
intimate
with
sophia
and
over
a
longer
period
of
time
than
he
had
ever
been
with
stephanie
and
even
if
stephanie
appeared
impossibly
on
the
spot
and
he
spent
the
rest
of
his
life
as
her
husband
still
he
would
never
forget
his
with
sophia
in
time
he
could
let
himself
tell
her
that
but
not
now
now
the
best
thing
he
could
do
would
be
to
change
the
subject
i
see
sophia
answered
him
coldly
no
you
do
maybe
some
day
you
will
there
nothing
but
what
you
told
me
i
see
no
forget
it
he
told
her
wearily
of
course
it
was
only
a
dream
anyway
the
dream
before
that
i
almost
killed
you
out
of
hatred
anyway
love
and
hate
i
guess
they
neutralize
we
just
a
couple
of
people
who
have
to
do
a
job
together
that
all
for
gosh
sakes
sophia
that
is
true
i
loved
stephanie
i
still
would
were
stephanie
alive
but
she
she
about
as
accessible
as
the
queen
of
sheba
so
there
an
american
expression
you
carrying
a
torch
probably
temple
realized
it
was
true
but
what
did
all
of
that
have
to
do
with
sophia
if
he
and
sophia
if
they
would
it
be
fair
to
sophia
it
would
be
exactly
as
if
a
widower
remarried
with
the
memory
of
his
first
wife
set
aside
in
his
heart
no
different
for
he
had
never
wed
stephanie
and
always
in
him
would
be
the
desire
for
what
had
never
been
let
talk
about
it
some
other
time
temple
almost
pleaded
wanting
the
respite
for
himself
as
much
as
for
sophia
no
we
do
have
to
talk
about
it
ever
i
wo
be
second
best
kit
let
forget
all
about
it
and
do
our
job
i
i
sorry
i
brought
the
whole
thing
up
temple
felt
like
an
unspeakable
heel
and
anyway
the
whole
thing
was
resolved
in
his
mind
but
they
could
just
let
it
go
at
that
not
in
case
something
happened
when
the
ships
came
and
one
or
both
of
them
perished
awkwardly
for
now
he
felt
about
everything
he
got
his
arms
about
sophia
drew
her
to
him
placed
his
lips
to
hers
that
was
as
far
as
he
got
she
wrenched
free
shoved
clear
of
him
if
you
try
that
again
you
will
have
another
dislocated
jaw
temple
shrugged
wearily
if
anything
were
to
be
resolved
between
them
it
would
be
later
when
the
ships
came
moments
afterwards
seven
not
the
five
arkalion
predicted
they
were
completely
unprepared
temple
spotted
them
first
on
one
of
the
viewing
screens
half
way
between
the
receiver
and
the
space
station
itself
silhouetted
against
the
elongated
shield
of
andromeda
they
soared
out
of
the
picture
appeared
again
minutes
later
zooming
in
from
the
other
direction
in
two
flights
of
four
ships
and
three
come
on
sophia
cried
over
her
shoulder
irising
the
door
and
plunging
from
the
room
temple
followed
at
her
heels
but
her
jupiter
trained
muscles
pushed
her
lithe
legs
in
long
powerful
strides
and
soon
she
outdistanced
him
by
the
time
he
reached
the
armaments
vault
breathless
she
was
seated
at
the
single
her
fingers
on
the
controls
watch
the
viewing
screen
and
tell
me
how
we
doing
sophia
told
him
not
taking
her
eyes
from
the
dials
and
levers
temple
watched
fascinated
saw
a
thin
pencil
of
radiant
energy
leap
out
into
space
missing
one
of
the
ships
by
what
looked
like
a
scant
few
miles
he
called
the
corrective
azimuth
to
her
hardly
surprised
by
the
way
his
mind
had
absorbed
and
now
could
use
its
knowledge
temple
understood
and
yet
did
not
understand
for
example
he
knew
the
station
had
but
one
gun
and
sophia
sat
at
it
now
yet
in
certain
ways
it
did
make
sense
could
it
cover
all
sectors
of
space
his
mind
supplied
the
answer
although
he
had
not
been
aware
of
the
knowledge
an
instant
before
yes
the
space
station
did
not
merely
rotate
its
surface
was
a
spherical
projection
of
a
moving
moebius
strip
and
although
he
tried
to
envision
the
concept
he
failed
the
weapon
could
be
fired
at
any
given
point
in
space
at
twenty
second
intervals
covering
every
other
conceivable
point
in
the
ensuing
time
sophia
was
firing
again
and
temple
watched
the
thin
beam
leap
across
space
hit
he
roared
hit
something
flashed
at
the
front
end
of
the
lead
ship
the
light
blinded
him
but
when
he
could
see
again
only
six
ships
remained
in
space
casting
perfect
shadows
on
the
andromeda
galaxy
the
source
of
light
temple
realized
triumphantly
was
out
of
range
but
he
could
picture
it
a
glowing
derelict
of
a
ship
spewing
heat
light
and
radioactivity
into
the
void
one
down
sophia
called
six
to
go
i
like
your
american
expressions
like
sitting
ducks
she
did
not
finish
abruptly
light
flared
all
around
them
something
shrieked
in
temple
ears
the
vault
shuddered
shook
girders
clattered
to
the
floor
stove
it
in
revealing
black
rock
sophia
was
thrown
back
from
the
single
gun
crashing
against
the
wall
flipping
in
air
and
landing
on
her
stomach
temple
ran
to
her
turned
her
over
blood
smeared
her
face
trickled
from
her
lips
although
she
did
not
move
she
was
dead
temple
half
dragged
half
carried
her
from
the
vault
into
an
adjoining
room
he
stretched
her
out
comfortably
as
he
could
on
the
floor
ran
back
into
the
vault
molten
metal
had
collected
in
one
corner
of
the
room
crept
sluggishly
toward
him
across
the
floor
heating
it
he
skirted
it
climbed
over
a
twisted
girder
pushed
his
way
past
other
debris
found
himself
at
the
gun
emplacement
how
dumb
can
i
get
temple
said
aloud
sophia
ran
to
the
gun
must
have
assumed
i
set
up
the
shields
again
it
was
an
item
of
information
stored
in
his
mind
by
the
wisdom
of
the
space
station
protective
shields
made
it
impossible
for
anything
but
a
direct
hit
on
the
emplacement
to
do
them
any
harm
only
temple
had
never
set
the
shields
in
place
he
did
so
now
merely
by
tripping
a
series
of
levers
but
glancing
at
a
dial
to
his
left
he
realized
with
alarm
that
the
damage
possibly
had
already
been
done
the
needle
which
measured
lethal
radiation
hovered
half
way
between
negative
and
the
critical
area
marked
in
red
and
even
as
temple
watched
it
crept
closer
to
the
red
how
much
time
did
he
have
temple
could
not
be
sure
bent
grimly
over
the
weapon
it
was
completely
unfamiliar
to
his
mind
completely
unfamiliar
to
his
fingers
he
toyed
with
it
released
a
blast
of
radiant
energy
whirled
to
face
the
viewing
screen
the
beam
streaked
out
into
the
void
clearly
hundreds
of
miles
from
its
objective
cursing
temple
tried
again
scoring
a
near
miss
the
ships
were
trading
a
steady
stream
of
fire
with
him
now
but
with
the
shielding
up
it
was
harmless
striking
and
then
bouncing
back
into
space
temple
scored
his
first
hit
five
minutes
after
sitting
down
at
the
gun
whooped
triumphantly
and
fired
again
five
ships
left
but
the
dial
indicated
an
increase
in
radioactivity
as
newly
created
neutrons
spread
their
poison
like
a
cancer
behind
temple
the
vault
was
a
shambles
the
pool
of
molten
metal
had
increased
in
size
almost
cutting
off
any
possibility
of
escape
he
could
jump
it
now
temple
realized
but
it
might
grow
larger
consolidating
its
gains
now
it
had
sheared
a
pit
in
the
floor
had
commenced
vaporizing
the
rock
below
it
hissing
and
lapping
with
insistence
something
boomed
grated
boomed
again
and
temple
watched
another
girder
bounce
off
the
floor
dip
one
end
into
the
molten
pool
and
clatter
out
a
stub
apparently
the
damage
was
extensive
a
structural
weakness
threatened
to
make
the
entire
ceiling
go
temple
fired
again
got
another
ship
he
could
almost
feel
death
breathing
on
his
shoulder
in
no
great
hurry
but
sure
of
its
prize
he
fired
the
weapon
if
one
ship
remained
when
they
could
no
longer
use
the
gun
they
would
have
failed
one
ship
might
make
the
difference
for
earth
one
three
left
two
they
raked
the
space
station
with
blast
after
blast
futilely
they
spun
and
twisted
and
streaked
by
offering
poor
targets
temple
waited
his
chance
and
glanced
at
the
dial
which
measured
radioactivity
he
yelped
stood
up
the
needle
had
encroached
upon
the
red
area
death
to
remain
where
he
was
more
than
a
moment
or
two
not
quick
death
but
rather
slow
and
lingering
he
could
do
what
he
had
to
then
perish
hours
later
his
life
for
earth
if
arkalion
had
known
all
the
answers
and
if
he
could
get
both
ships
and
if
there
another
alternative
for
the
aliens
the
parasites
temple
stabbed
out
with
his
pencil
beam
caught
the
sixth
ship
then
saw
the
needle
dip
completely
into
the
red
he
got
up
trembling
stepped
back
half
tripped
on
the
stump
of
a
girder
as
his
eyes
strayed
in
fascination
to
the
viewing
screen
the
seventh
ship
was
out
of
range
hovering
off
in
the
void
somewhere
awaiting
its
chance
if
temple
left
the
gun
the
ship
would
come
in
close
enough
to
hit
the
emplacement
despite
its
protective
shielding
well
it
was
suicide
to
remain
there
especially
when
the
ship
was
even
in
view
temple
leaped
over
the
molten
pool
and
left
the
vault
he
found
sophia
stirring
sitting
up
what
hit
me
she
said
and
laughed
something
seems
to
have
gone
wrong
kit
what
it
all
right
now
he
told
her
lying
you
look
pale
you
got
one
i
got
five
one
ship
to
go
what
are
you
waiting
for
and
sophia
sprang
to
her
feet
heading
for
the
vault
hold
it
temple
snapped
do
go
in
there
why
not
i
get
the
last
ship
and
go
in
there
temple
tugged
at
her
arm
pulled
her
away
from
the
vault
and
its
broken
door
which
would
not
iris
closed
any
more
what
the
matter
kit
i
i
want
to
finish
the
last
one
myself
that
all
sophia
got
herself
loose
reached
the
circular
doorway
peered
inside
like
dante
inferno
she
said
you
told
me
nothing
was
the
matter
well
we
can
get
through
to
the
emplacement
kit
no
and
again
he
stopped
her
at
least
he
had
lived
in
freedom
all
his
life
and
although
he
was
still
young
and
did
not
want
to
die
sophia
had
never
known
freedom
until
now
and
it
would
be
right
if
she
perished
without
savoring
its
fruits
he
had
a
love
dust
fifty
centuries
he
had
his
past
and
his
memories
sophia
had
only
the
future
clearly
if
someone
had
to
yield
life
temple
would
do
it
it
worse
than
it
looks
he
told
her
quietly
drawing
her
back
from
the
door
again
he
explained
what
had
happened
told
her
the
radioactivity
had
not
quite
reached
critical
point
which
was
a
lie
so
he
concluded
we
wasting
time
if
i
rush
in
there
fire
and
rush
right
out
everything
will
be
fine
then
let
me
i
quicker
than
you
no
i
i
more
familiar
with
the
gun
dying
would
not
be
too
bad
if
he
went
with
reasonable
certainty
he
had
saved
the
earth
no
man
ever
died
so
importantly
temple
thought
briefly
then
felt
cold
fear
when
he
realized
it
would
be
dying
just
the
same
he
fought
it
down
said
i
be
right
back
sophia
looked
at
him
smiling
vaguely
then
you
insist
on
doing
it
when
he
nodded
she
told
him
then
kiss
me
kiss
me
now
kit
in
case
something
fiercely
he
swept
her
to
him
bruising
her
lips
with
his
sophia
sophia
at
last
she
drew
back
kit
she
said
smiling
demurely
she
took
his
right
hand
in
her
left
held
it
squeezed
it
her
own
right
hand
she
suddenly
brought
up
from
her
waist
fist
clenched
driving
it
against
his
jaw
temple
fell
half
stunned
by
the
blow
at
her
feet
for
the
space
of
a
single
heartbeat
he
watched
her
move
slowly
toward
the
round
doorway
then
he
had
clambered
to
his
feet
running
after
her
he
got
his
arms
on
her
shoulders
yanked
at
her
when
she
turned
he
saw
she
was
crying
i
i
sorry
kit
you
fool
me
about
stephanie
you
ca
fool
me
about
this
she
had
more
leverage
this
time
she
stepped
back
bringing
her
small
hard
fist
up
from
her
knees
it
struck
temple
squarely
at
the
point
of
the
jaw
with
the
strength
of
muscle
behind
it
feet
left
the
floor
and
he
landed
with
a
thud
on
his
back
his
last
thought
of
sophia
or
of
anything
for
a
while
made
him
smile
faintly
as
he
lost
consciousness
for
a
kiss
she
had
promised
him
another
dislocated
jaw
and
she
had
kept
her
promise
later
how
much
later
he
did
not
know
something
soft
cushioned
his
head
he
opened
his
eyes
stared
through
swirling
spinning
murk
he
focused
saw
arkalion
no
two
arkalions
standing
off
at
a
distance
watching
him
he
squirmed
knew
his
head
was
cushioned
in
a
lap
he
sighed
tried
to
sit
up
and
failed
soft
hands
caressed
his
forehead
his
cheeks
a
face
swam
into
vision
but
mistily
sophia
he
murmured
his
vision
cleared
it
was
stephanie
it
over
said
arkalion
we
on
our
way
back
to
earth
kit
but
the
ships
all
destroyed
if
my
people
want
to
come
here
in
ten
thousand
years
let
them
try
i
have
a
hunch
you
of
earth
will
be
ready
for
them
it
took
us
five
thousand
to
reach
nowhere
temple
mused
it
will
take
us
five
thousand
to
return
we
come
barely
in
time
to
warn
earth
wrong
said
arkalion
i
still
have
my
ship
we
in
it
now
so
you
reach
earth
with
almost
fifty
centuries
to
spare
why
do
you
forget
about
it
though
if
human
progress
for
the
next
five
thousand
years
matches
what
has
been
happening
for
the
last
five
the
parasites
wo
stand
a
chance
earth
five
thousand
years
in
the
future
stephanie
said
dreamily
i
wonder
what
it
will
be
like
do
be
so
startled
kit
i
was
a
pilot
study
on
the
nowhere
journey
if
i
made
it
successfully
other
women
would
have
been
sent
but
now
there
wo
be
any
need
i
would
be
too
sure
of
that
said
the
real
alaric
arkalion
iii
i
suspect
a
lot
of
people
are
going
to
feel
just
like
me
why
not
go
out
and
colonize
space
we
can
do
it
wonderful
to
have
a
frontier
again
why
a
dozen
billionaires
will
appear
for
every
one
like
my
father
good
for
the
economy
so
if
we
do
like
earth
said
stephanie
we
can
always
go
out
i
have
a
strong
suspicion
you
will
like
it
said
arkalion
double
alaric
iii
grinned
what
about
you
bud
i
do
want
a
twin
brother
hanging
around
all
the
time
arkalion
grinned
back
at
him
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
young
man
i
forsaken
my
people
this
is
now
my
body
tell
you
what
i
promise
to
be
always
on
a
different
continent
earth
is
so
small
that
get
in
your
hair
temple
sat
up
felt
the
bandages
on
his
jaw
he
smiled
at
stephanie
told
her
he
loved
her
and
meant
it
it
was
exactly
as
if
she
had
returned
from
the
grave
and
in
his
first
exultation
he
had
even
thought
of
sophia
who
had
perished
all
alone
in
the
depths
of
space
that
a
world
might
live
he
turned
to
arkalion
sophia
we
found
her
dead
kit
but
smiling
as
if
everything
was
worth
it
it
should
have
been
me
whoever
sophia
was
said
stephanie
she
must
have
been
a
wonderful
woman
because
when
you
got
up
when
you
came
to
her
name
was
forget
it
said
temple
sophia
and
i
have
a
very
strange
relationship
and
all
right
you
said
forget
it
forget
it
stephanie
smiled
down
at
him
i
love
you
so
much
there
is
even
room
for
jealousy
ummm
kit
break
up
that
clinch
ordered
arkalion
we
making
one
more
stop
at
nowhere
to
pick
up
anyone
who
wants
to
return
to
earth
some
of
probably
wo
but
those
who
do
are
welcome
jason
will
stay
temple
predicted
he
be
a
leader
out
among
the
stars
then
he
have
to
climb
over
my
back
alaric
iii
predicted
happily
his
eyes
on
the
viewport
hungrily
temple
jaw
throbbed
he
was
tired
and
sleepy
but
satisfied
sophia
had
died
and
for
that
he
was
sad
but
there
would
always
be
a
place
deep
in
his
heart
for
the
memory
of
her
delicious
somehow
exotic
not
a
love
the
way
stephanie
was
not
as
tender
not
as
sure
but
a
feeling
for
sophia
that
was
completely
unique
and
whenever
the
strangeness
of
the
earth
frightened
temple
whenever
he
felt
a
situation
might
get
the
better
of
him
whenever
doubt
clouded
judgment
he
would
remember
the
tall
lithe
girl
who
had
walked
to
her
death
that
a
world
might
have
the
freedom
she
barely
had
tasted
and
together
with
stephanie
he
would
be
able
to
do
anything
unless
he
thought
dreamily
as
he
drifted
off
to
sleep
his
head
pillowed
again
on
stephanie
lap
he
wind
up
with
a
bum
jaw
the
rest
of
his
life
milton
lesser
started
reading
in
and
began
writing
it
in
since
then
he
has
had
a
myriad
stories
and
novels
published
under
many
of
this
novel
he
writes
along
with
a
lot
of
other
people
i
like
to
write
about
the
first
interstellar
voyage
the
reason
is
simple
once
mankind
gets
out
to
the
stars
and
begins
to
spread
out
across
the
galaxy
he
be
immortal
despite
his
best
make
that
efforts
to
destroy
himself
you
can
destroy
a
world
maybe
a
dozen
worlds
but
spread
humanity
out
thin
among
the
stars
colonies
here
there
and
all
over
and
he
immortal
he
live
as
long
as
there
a
universe
to
hold
him
i
know
interstellar
travel
is
a
long
way
off
but
science
has
a
way
of
leaping
ahead
in
geometric
not
arithmetic
progression
a
hundred
years
perhaps
