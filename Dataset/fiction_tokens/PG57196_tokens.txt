chapter
i
the
route
poor
old
larkins
and
his
wife
were
completely
broken
by
terrible
mishap
they
could
not
find
it
in
their
hearts
to
speak
harshly
of
their
unhappy
child
but
they
were
loudly
indignant
against
the
man
who
had
tempted
her
to
leave
her
home
herbert
too
came
in
for
his
share
of
their
reproaches
when
he
confessed
that
he
had
been
for
some
time
aware
of
the
intimacy
between
mimie
and
ernest
farrington
and
had
long
dreaded
some
such
catastrophe
herbert
larkins
had
said
to
him
more
than
once
think
you
should
have
seen
her
in
such
danger
and
never
to
let
on
a
word
i
thought
better
of
you
after
all
know
i
am
greatly
to
blame
mother
you
can
not
say
anything
harder
of
me
than
i
do
of
myself
but
she
promised
me
never
never
to
meet
him
again
and
i
trusted
her
it
natural
her
have
trusted
her
with
untold
gold
i
thought
she
was
as
good
as
gold
herself
and
better
what
stings
me
to
think
that
she
should
have
held
herself
so
cheap
as
to
be
led
astray
by
such
a
fellow
as
that
and
a
farrington
or
no
farrington
he
shall
answer
for
this
to
me
mother
and
that
i
herbert
lad
remember
who
he
is
and
who
you
warned
him
that
if
she
came
to
any
harm
be
even
with
him
and
i
will
so
help
me
heaven
herbert
talk
like
that
you
might
be
and
for
ever
disgraced
even
for
those
words
do
you
think
he
will
not
be
punished
some
day
as
he
deserves
and
that
whether
you
raise
a
little
finger
against
him
or
no
we
must
leave
him
in
other
resignation
hardly
chimed
in
with
impetuous
mood
be
after
him
now
aye
although
a
soldier
and
tied
by
the
leg
show
a
clean
pair
of
heels
only
it
was
clear
that
desertion
was
in
his
mind
me
herbert
swear
to
me
herbert
that
you
will
do
nothing
rash
desert
your
colours
forget
your
sacred
duty
even
for
had
made
up
my
mind
to
follow
them
last
night
i
could
have
got
a
passage
home
and
plain
clothes
and
everything
but
the
steamer
did
not
start
and
too
late
thank
god
for
that
but
why
you
heard
the
news
mother
then
he
bethought
himself
that
in
her
grievous
trial
there
was
but
little
likelihood
of
the
gossip
of
the
garrison
reaching
her
ears
in
herbert
went
on
using
the
catch
phrase
of
the
soldier
under
orders
for
active
service
and
we
start
directly
the
steamer
for
where
it
was
in
orders
last
night
and
the
generals
coming
to
inspect
us
this
afternoon
with
the
to
see
fit
for
service
and
not
the
whole
upside
down
officers
and
men
mad
with
delight
so
should
i
be
for
this
chance
which
may
not
come
when
you
meet
him
next
it
will
be
on
more
equal
but
when
will
that
be
i
may
have
to
wait
months
before
i
get
my
knuckles
at
his
these
orders
will
bring
him
out
to
at
once
ought
to
but
mean
enough
to
try
and
shirk
the
whole
business
heard
officers
of
the
regiment
say
as
much
and
in
any
case
he
arrive
before
we
start
for
the
the
staunch
old
couple
came
down
themselves
to
the
new
mole
to
bid
their
boy
godspeed
be
more
out
there
than
you
herkles
boy
said
the
old
sergeant
with
a
fierce
light
in
his
eye
he
had
made
no
great
demonstrations
but
conduct
had
perhaps
wounded
him
more
deeply
than
his
wife
now
for
a
moment
he
brightened
up
like
an
old
but
it
was
with
more
than
the
scent
of
the
coming
fray
ship
ordered
to
the
coast
and
maybe
send
him
ashore
with
the
naval
brigade
mate
and
a
right
handy
lad
so
foregather
and
between
you
you
might
have
a
chance
of
bringing
yon
scoundrel
to
try
said
herbert
with
his
teeth
set
only
make
an
honest
woman
of
my
sweet
bird
if
only
marry
and
behave
decently
to
cried
larkins
interposing
in
a
strong
indignant
voice
there
ever
a
farrington
who
behaved
decently
to
one
of
us
like
to
force
him
and
all
his
relations
too
but
up
god
bless
you
mother
and
you
sergeant
and
bring
all
things
right
in
the
with
that
amidst
thundering
cheers
and
the
invigorating
strains
of
lang
and
girl
i
left
behind
me
the
good
ship
slowly
got
under
weigh
it
is
no
part
of
my
intention
to
dilate
upon
the
events
of
the
ashanti
war
it
will
be
in
all
minds
how
early
mischances
brought
the
enemy
close
to
our
gates
and
rendered
imperative
the
despatch
of
some
capable
leader
to
grapple
with
the
emergency
how
sir
garnet
wolseley
the
hero
of
the
hour
accompanied
by
a
brilliant
staff
was
desired
to
drive
back
the
foe
with
such
forces
as
he
found
to
his
hand
how
fantee
allies
proved
the
most
despicable
cowards
and
the
small
force
of
british
seamen
and
marines
were
clearly
unequal
to
the
task
of
marching
upon
coomassie
the
objective
point
how
the
demand
for
british
regiments
was
at
length
complied
with
by
the
home
government
and
how
when
these
had
arrived
and
all
was
ready
for
the
forward
movement
a
sudden
collapse
in
transport
arrangements
threatened
to
paralyse
the
whole
of
the
operations
hence
it
was
that
the
british
regiments
were
not
immediately
disembarked
but
cruised
the
seas
till
a
new
and
more
vigorous
organisation
of
transport
could
be
devised
and
carried
out
we
will
take
up
the
thread
of
our
narrative
at
a
time
when
the
little
invading
army
was
across
the
prah
and
almost
within
striking
distance
of
coomassie
no
serious
collision
with
the
enemy
had
as
yet
occurred
but
some
sharp
fighting
was
obviously
imminent
it
was
thought
that
the
ashantis
would
hold
the
adansi
hills
and
even
if
forced
therefrom
would
make
more
than
one
subsequent
stand
and
it
was
probable
that
by
nothing
less
than
obstinate
fighting
would
the
ends
of
the
campaign
be
achieved
they
had
been
long
days
of
weary
waiting
for
all
concerned
the
country
was
hateful
and
noxious
in
the
extreme
yet
all
fought
bravely
not
against
the
foe
with
whom
they
had
scarcely
been
pitted
but
against
the
malaria
the
ever
present
fever
the
intolerable
heat
none
behaved
more
pluckily
than
the
own
wellington
once
said
me
the
dandies
for
hard
work
and
the
apothegm
might
be
extended
into
including
crack
corps
now
that
they
were
at
the
real
business
of
war
they
bore
hardships
privations
and
continuous
discomfort
without
a
murmur
the
once
splendid
mess
was
now
represented
by
a
scratch
meal
under
the
fetich
tree
of
a
deserted
village
its
entertainments
were
to
offer
to
comrades
a
cup
of
chocolate
a
slice
of
tinned
meat
or
sardine
upon
biscuit
instead
of
toast
luxury
was
a
thing
forgotten
by
all
days
of
toilsome
marching
through
the
interminable
forest
nights
in
drenching
rain
with
short
commons
in
almost
everything
except
quinine
were
but
poor
substitutes
for
what
they
had
left
behind
at
gibraltar
and
at
home
yet
the
own
took
everything
as
it
came
indulging
only
in
the
occasional
grumble
which
is
deemed
the
british
birthright
and
which
if
nothing
else
is
an
outlet
and
for
discontent
but
the
regiment
had
suffered
considerably
from
sickness
colonel
diggle
was
down
with
fever
he
had
been
one
of
the
first
attacked
and
though
he
had
borne
up
with
all
the
fortitude
he
could
muster
his
nature
was
not
of
that
resolute
kind
which
successfully
resists
disease
very
soon
after
disembarkation
he
had
succumbed
and
while
he
was
lying
in
his
cot
on
board
the
hospital
ship
major
greathed
had
the
honour
of
commanding
the
own
in
the
field
several
other
officers
were
also
on
the
sick
list
and
a
large
percentage
of
the
rank
and
file
among
the
latter
was
herbert
larkins
he
had
fought
with
extraordinary
pluck
against
the
insidious
advances
of
the
fever
he
had
doctored
himself
had
taken
quarts
of
quinine
had
refused
persistently
to
seek
for
medical
advice
lest
he
should
be
struck
off
duty
and
sent
to
hospital
with
it
all
he
had
stuck
manfully
to
his
work
no
easy
task
for
during
a
portion
of
the
time
the
had
been
de
and
greathed
had
selected
herbert
to
act
in
his
place
all
this
told
on
him
one
day
after
many
unremitting
toil
whipping
up
the
craven
carriers
who
tardily
brought
forward
the
regimental
supplies
followed
by
long
labours
in
issuing
rations
herbert
suddenly
dropped
as
if
he
had
been
shot
through
the
head
they
laid
him
in
a
hammock
and
carried
him
with
them
for
a
time
as
they
were
then
approaching
the
adansi
hills
and
an
action
seemed
imminent
nothing
of
the
kind
as
is
well
known
occurred
after
a
short
breathing
space
the
advance
was
resumed
herbert
who
had
at
length
recovered
consciousness
saw
to
his
mortification
the
regiment
march
out
of
the
village
in
which
they
had
been
encamped
while
he
was
left
with
a
score
or
so
of
sick
and
helpless
behind
it
was
the
more
aggravating
because
the
crisis
of
the
campaign
was
seemingly
near
at
hand
coomassie
itself
was
not
more
than
five
and
twenty
or
thirty
miles
distant
the
enemy
was
known
to
be
in
force
in
front
and
in
flank
fighting
more
or
less
severe
there
must
be
and
that
very
soon
to
think
that
he
should
miss
it
after
all
but
as
will
be
seen
luck
was
not
entirely
against
him
young
strong
and
sound
as
a
bell
he
had
rallied
wonderfully
from
his
attack
and
was
already
on
the
high
road
to
convalescence
within
a
day
or
two
of
the
departure
ye
gae
on
like
this
be
as
fit
as
a
fiddle
in
a
week
the
scotch
doctor
said
when
may
i
go
to
the
front
sir
once
if
the
commanding
officer
let
herbert
almost
jumped
off
his
bed
and
hurriedly
smartened
himself
as
well
as
he
could
to
appear
before
the
commandant
but
on
leaving
the
hospital
a
substantial
building
which
had
evidently
been
the
palace
of
an
ashanti
chief
he
found
the
little
garrison
which
held
the
village
i
will
call
it
yankowfum
in
a
state
of
agitation
almost
uproar
important
news
had
come
back
from
the
front
there
had
been
a
great
battle
amoaful
we
had
won
it
but
not
without
serious
losses
the
enemy
was
still
full
of
fight
a
special
despatch
had
been
received
by
the
commandant
at
yankowfum
to
be
on
the
his
and
the
other
posts
along
the
line
of
advance
would
probably
be
attacked
in
force
and
the
ashantis
must
be
driven
back
at
all
costs
this
with
many
additions
had
gone
forth
among
the
handful
of
sailors
and
west
indians
composing
the
garrison
and
was
being
loudly
discussed
when
herbert
appeared
the
commandant
herbert
asked
is
he
know
his
name
one
of
your
lot
said
an
a
poor
lot
too
i
take
it
said
another
judge
by
his
looks
and
his
herbert
was
about
to
retort
when
a
black
soldier
in
his
picturesque
zouave
dress
came
up
and
said
colonel
one
time
come
very
much
angry
with
buckra
it
was
the
officer
in
general
charge
of
the
communications
who
had
hastened
back
from
amoaful
to
look
to
the
security
of
his
posts
he
was
travelling
almost
alone
in
a
hammock
carried
by
bearers
and
seemed
to
think
nothing
of
the
dangers
he
braved
as
he
passed
through
the
bush
swarming
with
enemies
he
was
apparently
seeking
to
infuse
some
of
his
own
spirit
into
the
commandant
of
yankowfum
do
it
easily
enough
herbert
heard
him
say
as
he
approached
them
meaning
to
offer
his
services
place
is
stockaded
got
a
so
small
said
the
other
fifty
men
and
half
of
them
that
voice
surely
it
was
familiar
herbert
thought
give
you
another
man
there
time
besides
every
other
post
is
threatened
however
got
your
orders
you
must
hold
out
to
the
last
you
understand
said
the
colonel
pretty
sharply
sir
not
fair
upon
us
i
must
really
protest
we
shall
be
cut
to
pieces
what
can
such
a
handful
do
for
sake
leave
us
like
this
the
other
turned
on
his
heel
but
stopped
short
to
say
my
word
farrington
i
can
not
compliment
you
on
your
demeanour
if
there
was
another
officer
within
reach
relieve
you
of
your
command
i
wish
even
there
was
a
steady
old
sergeant
or
two
then
his
eye
fell
upon
herbert
who
had
moved
a
little
farther
away
during
the
foregoing
colloquy
partly
because
he
felt
that
he
ought
not
to
overhear
the
strictures
and
partly
because
he
was
greatly
excited
at
this
unexpected
rencontre
with
ernest
farrington
a
sergeant
a
too
you
have
heard
no
doubt
the
post
is
about
to
be
attacked
i
have
been
telling
the
commandant
here
he
must
draw
in
the
line
of
defence
be
careful
not
to
waste
ammunition
and
hold
on
like
grim
death
you
understand
right
sir
answered
herbert
cheerily
and
the
colonel
went
off
probably
a
little
happier
in
his
mind
further
orders
sir
herbert
quietly
asked
of
ernest
farrington
who
was
ashen
pale
and
too
much
agitated
seemingly
to
recognise
the
man
who
spoke
to
him
no
do
the
best
you
can
whereat
herbert
saluted
and
walked
off
it
would
be
time
enough
to
settle
their
differences
by
and
bye
perhaps
by
nightfall
neither
of
them
would
be
alive
chapter
ii
the
victoria
cross
a
stout
and
substantial
stockade
of
bamboos
having
loopholes
and
a
shallow
ditch
surrounded
the
village
of
yankowfum
and
seemed
sufficient
if
it
were
only
manned
throughout
to
keep
out
any
attacking
force
but
the
little
garrison
was
not
strong
enough
to
occupy
more
than
a
third
of
its
length
it
was
a
question
therefore
whether
it
would
not
be
wisest
to
limit
the
defence
and
instead
of
holding
the
outer
and
too
extended
line
concentrate
the
whole
force
within
the
hospital
building
which
was
certainly
large
but
still
compact
and
reasonably
strong
this
is
what
our
hero
had
to
decide
for
it
was
upon
herbert
that
the
responsibility
seemed
to
fall
ernest
farrington
was
almost
helpless
whether
from
abject
incapacity
or
from
the
more
despicable
reason
of
total
want
of
nerve
besides
after
what
the
staff
colonel
had
said
herbert
felt
that
he
was
bound
to
act
and
do
the
best
he
could
he
consulted
with
one
or
two
of
the
others
particularly
an
old
who
deferred
to
him
as
senior
in
rank
and
a
very
smart
young
sailor
a
petty
officer
who
like
every
true
blue
jacket
was
ready
to
put
his
hand
to
anything
hold
on
to
the
front
line
at
least
for
a
bit
the
thought
can
fall
back
upon
the
hospital
if
hard
i
agree
to
that
replied
herbert
the
hospital
will
be
our
real
centre
and
chief
defence
it
must

asked
of

or
my
not

jaw
dropped
with
amazement
of
the
barrack
sergeant
once
at
triggertown
and
now
at

the
other
nodded
you
know

i
am
why
hercules

your
it
was
turn
to
show
astonishment
there
none
of
your
games
little
herkles
boy
you
may
take
your
oath
to
i
then
they
shook
hands
warmly
and
looked
at
each
other
and
shook
hands
again
and
again
lads
interposed
the
up
get
looking
for
the
strawberry
marks
or
may
be
the
niggers
will
drop
on
to
you
and
save
you
all
the
right
said
herbert
promptly
this
will
keep
now
rechab
lad
to
your
post
more
to
tell
you
but
that
too
will
why
tell
him
that
ernest
farrington
was
also
there
sharing
their
danger
herbert
following
the
advice
resolved
to
hold
the
stockade
but
at
its
angles
and
points
only
whence
a
fairly
good
flanking
fire
across
the
front
could
be
maintained
at
each
of
these
he
posted
a
small
detachment
under
the
command
of
a
officer
to
whom
he
gave
explicit
orders
they
were
to
save
ammunition
to
slow
and
fire
low
as
the
general
said
and
hold
on
till
they
got
the
signal
to
retire
this
would
be
passed
from
the
centre
the
moment
the
stockade
was
forced
at
any
point
the
retreat
was
to
be
made
with
all
speed
upon
the
hospital
under
cover
of
its
fire
at
the
hospital
itself
a
small
garrison
was
also
posted
from
the
first
composed
of
the
convalescents
of
all
in
fact
who
had
spirit
enough
to
rise
from
their
beds
even
mccosh
got
out
his
revolver
and
promised
to
assist
none
of
the
sick
were
strong
enough
to
form
part
of
the
outer
line
nor
could
they
have
retreated
rapidly
when
that
line
was
broken
through
but
they
would
be
able
to
load
and
fire
alternately
standing
and
sitting
and
so
contribute
much
to
the
general
inner
defence
when
these
dispositions
were
in
a
fair
way
towards
completion
herbert
went
in
search
of
his
commanding
officer
to
report
progress
you
inspect
the
post
sir
everything
is
as
ready
as
we
can
make
it
we
only
want
the
enemy
now
and
they
can
come
on
as
soon
as
they
farrington
winced
slightly
at
the
mention
of
the
enemy
but
he
was
now
far
more
master
of
himself
than
when
herbert
had
seen
him
last
he
had
pulled
himself
together
and
seemed
about
to
take
his
proper
position
as
commanding
officer
and
chief
like
many
other
weak
spirits
he
made
up
for
former
shortcomings
by
assuming
a
blustering
air
daresay
you
have
done
your
best
we
shall
see
where
are
the
men
posted
at
the
stockade
oh
this
do
at
all
we
can
not
hold
the
stockade
we
are
too
few
the
hospital
is
our
only
chance
everyone
must
be
concentrated
sir
we
can
not
resign
the
stockade
without
a
you
dispute
my
orders
put
you
under
arrest
and
have
you
tried
for
mutinous
conduct
who
are
you
your
name
am
larkins
of
the
larkins
what
larkins
not
mi
mi
brother
farrington
who
told
you
not
so
long
ago
that
if
you
injured
her
he
would
break
every
bone
in
your
skin
her
own
brother
is
here
too
to
hinder
us
from
putting
a
bullet
through
you
now
you
cur
dare
you
address
me
like
that
have
you
placed
in
irons
you
shall
be
charged
with
mutiny
by
george
get
you
the
ashantis
will
save
you
and
me
the
trouble
said
herbert
significantly
if
we
get
through
this
day
all
right
you
and
i
have
other
differences
to
settle
remember
this
is
insufferable
shove
you
in
arrest
put
a
sentry
over
farrington
suddenly
turned
quite
white
his
teeth
chattered
and
he
could
hardly
stand
in
name
is
that
he
stammered
out
a
roar
of
voices
harsh
discordant
and
loud
enough
to
rouse
the
dead
it
was
the
ashanti
song
of
battle
sung
by
thousands
as
it
seemed
uniting
into
one
grand
but
savage
chorus
of
defiance
behind
all
was
the
hideous
noise
of
screeching
horns
and
the
rattle
of
native
drums
for
some
minutes
the
uproar
continued
then
ceased
as
suddenly
as
it
had
arisen
it
was
followed
by
a
sound
more
familiar
and
far
more
impressive
at
least
in
a
ears
this
was
the
sharp
and
sustained
crackling
of
musketry
fire
the
ball
had
begun
quarrel
will
keep
sir
something
else
to
be
done
now
any
orders
sir
at
least
yes
perhaps
the
men
had
better
stay
where
they
are
just
at
first
you
can
withdraw
them
when
you
think
you
ought
i
shall
go
myself
to
the
hospital
it
is
more
central
and
i
can
see
all
around
from
and
farrington
who
was
becoming
more
than
uncomfortable
as
the
slugs
were
falling
rapidly
around
went
off
with
rather
indecent
haste
the
enemy
were
still
in
the
bush
surrounding
the
village
and
the
garrison
had
not
yet
returned
the
fire
emboldened
by
this
the
ashantis
came
out
from
their
cover
and
showed
themselves
in
increasing
numbers
all
round
the
stockade
this
was
the
opportunity
for
the
defenders
at
a
signal
from
herbert
a
fire
from
the
several
flanks
made
considerable
havoc
and
the
ashantis
fell
back
they
came
on
however
again
and
again
again
and
again
they
were
repulsed
but
they
were
maddened
not
disheartened
by
their
losses
and
once
more
attacking
with
determination
at
one
point
carried
the
stockade
it
was
time
now
to
retire
upon
the
hospital
this
was
effected
rapidly
but
without
disorder
the
wounded
happily
very
few
so
far
were
carried
within
the
walls
where
all
who
were
still
sound
also
took
up
their
posts
this
inner
citadel
was
perhaps
not
impregnable
but
with
resolution
it
might
be
held
against
very
considerable
odds
told
you
the
stockade
should
not
have
been
held
some
one
said
to
herbert
and
turning
he
saw
farrington
who
had
not
before
shown
himself
during
the
fight
beg
your
pardon
sir
if
you
had
been
with
us
in
the
front
you
would
have
thought
otherwise
herbert
answered
rather
intemperately
but
it
chafed
him
to
find
his
officer
keeping
out
of
way
any
rate
we
fall
back
any
more
if
the
enemy
force
their
way
in
here
we
are
lost
but
this
the
ashantis
could
not
effect
they
surged
up
against
the
walls
like
waves
upon
a
rocky
headland
only
to
fall
back
like
breakers
in
a
thousand
drops
they
sought
to
force
the
barricades
to
escalade
and
enter
by
the
roof
once
or
twice
their
efforts
seemed
near
success
but
the
obstinate
opposition
which
they
met
sent
them
reeling
back
discomfited
at
this
juncture
herbert
with
the
intuitive
judgment
of
the
true
general
felt
that
a
counterstroke
would
probably
give
the
defenders
the
day
he
proposed
a
sally
of
the
whole
force
and
a
bayonet
charge
no
account
it
would
be
madness
said
ernest
farrington
whom
he
discovered
with
difficulty
ensconced
behind
some
cases
of
commissariat
stores
do
you
say
boys
shall
we
give
a
touch
of
the
cold
steel
cried
herbert
a
hearty
cheer
was
the
ready
response
you
lead
us
herbert
said
to
farrington
in
a
strong
accent
of
scorn
your
last
chance
to
retrieve
your
distinctly
forbid
you
to
sally
not
a
man
shall
leave
the
hospital
halt
halt
i
the
men
were
like
bloodhounds
tearing
frantically
at
the
leash
your
last
chance
herbert
repeated
as
he
went
close
up
to
farrington
and
whispered
last
chance
you
cowardly
cur
come
on
or
be
shamed
for
ever
a
disgrace
to
your
cloth
your
regiment
and
a
good
old
stung
to
the
quick
by
these
taunts
ernest
hurriedly
drew
his
sword
and
placing
himself
at
the
head
of
his
men
gave
the
order
to
port
arms
and
prepare
to
charge
with
a
loud
the
gallant
garrison
rushed
out
and
fell
upon
their
foe
the
enemy
could
not
face
the
british
bayonet
they
broke
even
before
their
assailants
reached
them
and
fled
in
disorder
towards
the
stockade
the
garrison
pursued
them
farrington
still
leading
he
was
like
a
jibbing
horse
which
having
long
refused
to
move
at
last
bolts
headlong
herbert
was
also
well
to
the
front
but
he
saw
the
danger
of
pushing
the
success
too
far
and
before
reaching
the
stockade
he
paused
and
endeavoured
to
restrain
the
men
many
halted
at
his
voice
and
rallied
round
him
but
a
few
more
unmanageable
continued
to
race
ahead
beyond
the
stockade
as
far
as
the
bush
farrington
with
excitement
was
one
of
these
and
with
them
he
fell
into
a
trap
a
number
of
ashantis
reinforced
probably
from
behind
had
rallied
just
within
the
bush
and
opened
a
very
destructive
fire
ernest
farrington
was
the
first
to
fall
many
others
were
struck
down
and
the
too
eager
band
of
pursuers
were
suddenly
effectually
checked
but
all
who
could
retired
in
hot
haste
upon
the
main
body
which
under
command
had
made
a
stand
to
cover
their
retreat
farrington
was
not
killed
outright
he
was
evidently
badly
wounded
but
he
was
able
to
rise
to
his
feet
and
strove
feebly
to
make
his
way
back
to
the
shelter
of
the
stockade
the
enemy
slowly
at
him
as
he
crawled
along
must
bring
him
in
cried
herbert
hotly
on
rechab
farrington
or
no
farrington
yon
ernest
farrington
yes
let
him
be
let
him
die
the
death
i
stir
a
step
to
help
the
accursed
herbert
did
not
wait
to
hear
all
words
but
rushed
forward
alone
into
the
open
the
fire
increased
in
fury
but
he
passed
through
it
and
reached
side
unscathed
on
sir
he
said
on
me
get
back
but
almost
as
he
spoke
ernest
fell
helplessly
struck
by
a
second
slug
there
was
nothing
for
herbert
but
to
lift
the
inanimate
body
upon
his
shoulders
and
stagger
back
as
best
he
could
he
was
himself
wounded
more
than
once
but
only
slightly
before
he
regained
the
stockade
but
still
he
regained
it
and
laid
his
burden
safely
within
done
mon
weel
done
said
the
surgeon
see
if
ye
were
in
time
or
no
and
he
proceeded
to
examine
hurts
the
pain
of
probing
the
wounds
brought
the
unfortunate
officer
to
his
senses
and
opening
his
eyes
he
looked
wildly
around
larkins
is
larkins
here
he
gasped
both
who
bore
that
name
knelt
by
his
side
and
hung
breathlessly
upon
his
words
loved
her
i
did
upon
my
soul
tell
her
i
said
so
with
my
last
words
that
i
ask
her
forgiveness
as
i
do
yours
i
wronged
her
but
i
i
repaired
it
the
blood
gushed
in
a
torrent
from
his
mouth
and
in
another
second
he
was
dead
the
enemy
made
no
further
demonstrations
against
yankowfum
and
by
nightfall
the
post
had
almost
regained
its
normal
condition
it
had
been
an
eventful
day
for
herbert
larkins
and
one
likely
to
lay
the
foundation
of
his
fortunes
for
his
gallant
conduct
did
not
pass
unnoticed
early
the
next
morning
the
staff
colonel
returned
and
heard
a
full
account
of
the
fight
herbert
was
too
modest
to
descant
upon
his
own
deeds
but
mccosh
and
the
others
described
in
glowing
terms
the
story
of
the
defence
and
of
brave
attempt
to
save
life
ought
to
have
the
cross
for
this
said
the
colonel
a
quiet
man
rising
for
the
moment
into
enthusiasm
deserve
the
victoria
cross
and
a
commission
too
do
my
best
to
help
you
to
he
was
as
good
as
his
word
before
the
own
left
the
coast
the
contained
both
announcements
and
herbert
larkins
was
now
officer
and
a
at
last
chapter
iii
making
the
amende
there
was
terrible
grief
at
farrington
hall
when
the
news
came
home
of
the
death
of
the
son
and
heir
poor
silly
lady
farrington
was
quite
had
she
had
her
way
ernest
would
never
have
gone
to
the
wars
moreover
the
circumstances
under
which
he
left
made
matters
infinitely
worse
he
was
at
home
as
we
know
when
the
regiment
got
the
route
and
the
orders
he
received
from
the
horse
guards
were
peremptory
that
he
should
rejoin
without
a
delay
the
young
soldier
was
not
over
keen
about
obeying
life
in
spite
of
family
jars
had
just
then
a
peculiar
sweetness
for
him
he
had
established
mimie
in
a
pretty
little
villa
at
wimbledon
where
he
spent
most
of
his
time
his
visits
to
the
hall
and
his
stay
when
he
came
were
much
curtailed
greatly
to
his
sorrow
her
ladyship
knew
of
his
but
quite
as
a
secret
and
she
was
discreetly
silent
on
the
subject
she
only
upbraided
her
boy
for
his
constant
absences
too
bad
ernetht
we
thee
tho
little
of
you
now
you
mutht
come
and
thettle
down
at
home
marry
a
nithe
wife
which
was
meant
as
a
gentle
womanly
hint
that
she
knew
what
occupied
his
thoughts
and
his
time
sir
line
towards
ernest
was
more
plainly
marked
and
possibly
less
judicious
he
very
soon
gave
his
son
to
understand
that
he
knew
all
about
the
gibraltar
escapade
thought
it
was
only
a
passing
act
of
folly
young
men
can
not
always
be
trusted
to
behave
with
judgment
and
decorum
it
is
very
deplorable
of
course
but
no
more
after
all
than
others
have
done
what
i
complain
of
ernest
is
that
there
appears
to
be
no
end
to
your
infatuation
i
hear
no
matter
how
oozenam
i
presume
said
ernest
bitterly
knew
he
was
dogging
my
footsteps
but
did
not
think
he
had
been
set
on
by
my
father
a
disgraceful
shame
hear
went
on
sir
rupert
speaking
still
calmly
but
the
black
look
on
his
face
showed
that
he
was
fast
growing
furious
you
are
continually
at
a
house
at
wimbledon
where
i
suppose
this
this
person
here
father
you
are
going
too
far
put
in
ernest
hotly
am
quite
old
enough
to
make
a
fool
of
yourself
no
doubt
you
always
were
that
been
a
fool
all
your
life
but
you
shall
not
make
a
fool
of
stay
another
minute
in
the
you
leave
it
you
shall
not
return
to
it
until
you
have
begged
my
sir
rupert
was
very
angry
still
he
strove
to
be
calm
careful
ernest
how
you
aggravate
me
i
am
willing
to
make
allowances
for
your
youth
but
you
shall
not
disgrace
your
name
promise
me
to
give
up
this
affair
at
once
and
for
ever
or
or
will
do
nothing
of
the
kind
i
will
not
be
treated
as
a
child
cried
ernest
in
a
loud
voice
take
the
consequences
sir
shouted
sir
rupert
still
louder
my
presence
sir
leave
the
room
sir
leave
the
house
sir
and
do
not
dare
to
show
yourself
again
sir
till
i
ask
you
which
will
be
never
never
sir
so
help
me
ernest
with
a
white
and
rather
scared
face
got
up
and
quietly
walked
away
his
father
and
he
never
met
again
in
the
flesh
there
were
many
efforts
at
reconciliation
but
all
had
fallen
through
ernest
before
leaving
the
hall
had
gone
to
his
mother
to
say
and
there
had
been
a
very
painful
scene
the
poor
woman
was
torn
by
conflicting
emotions
she
was
passionately
fond
of
her
boy
and
desperately
afraid
of
her
fierce
spouse
but
her
maternal
instincts
carried
the
day
and
she
braved
her
anger
seeking
to
win
forgiveness
for
her
son
she
failed
utterly
the
parties
to
the
quarrel
were
equally
determined
but
in
different
ways
ernest
was
weakly
and
foolishly
obstinate
sir
rupert
harsh
implacable
unrelenting
father
insisted
upon
submission
unconditional
and
complete
son
refused
even
to
admit
that
he
was
wrong
farrington
hall
was
a
sad
house
while
the
dispute
was
in
progress
and
lady
farrington
was
a
very
unhappy
woman
then
while
matters
were
still
unaccommodated
came
the
orders
for
active
service
and
she
was
in
a
paroxysm
of
despair
she
made
piteous
appeals
to
sir
rupert
she
wrote
imploring
letters
to
her
son
she
besought
the
horse
guards
to
delay
embarkation
and
pleaded
all
sorts
of
excuses
to
keep
him
at
home
but
fate
and
the
authorities
were
inexorable
and
ernest
very
much
against
his
own
will
too
was
compelled
to
start
for
the
coast
he
had
never
revisited
the
hall
his
father
would
not
ask
him
and
he
would
not
offer
himself
his
mother
begged
to
be
allowed
to
go
to
southampton
to
bid
him
a
last
farewell
but
sir
rupert
positively
forbade
it
and
ernest
left
the
country
with
no
one
except
mimie
to
bid
him
adieu
this
was
why
the
news
of
his
death
fell
so
heavily
upon
them
all
at
home
lady
farrington
broke
down
utterly
she
was
like
rachel
and
refused
to
be
comforted
sir
rupert
although
he
was
still
outwardly
calm
and
impassive
felt
it
more
than
he
could
say
but
he
showed
his
grief
very
differently
it
was
a
sort
of
relief
to
him
to
burst
forth
into
the
loudest
invectives
not
against
himself
although
his
parental
cruelty
might
well
have
caused
him
the
keenest
remorse
but
against
all
who
might
by
the
smallest
implication
be
deemed
to
be
responsible
for
untimely
end
where
was
diggle
why
had
he
allowed
the
young
fellow
out
of
his
sight
and
sir
garnet
what
excuse
would
the
general
make
for
leaving
a
young
officer
to
be
thus
and
massacred
by
the
rascally
foe
he
even
included
mimie
larkins
in
his
reproaches
although
she
manifestly
was
but
little
to
blame
he
could
not
at
first
bring
himself
to
think
well
of
herbert
whose
brave
act
in
trying
to
save
his
life
was
hailed
with
enthusiasm
in
this
country
as
soon
as
it
became
known
what
had
this
sergeant
done
only
his
duty
it
was
the
duty
of
every
sergeant
or
corporal
in
the
service
to
lay
down
his
life
for
a
farrington
of
course
and
the
young
fellow
had
been
amply
rewarded
over
rewarded
if
anything
for
his
pains
but
deeper
down
in
sir
heart
there
was
anguish
and
sharp
regret
as
a
father
he
was
deeply
grieved
at
the
loss
of
an
only
son
but
as
the
proud
owner
of
an
old
title
and
wide
estates
it
cut
him
to
the
heart
to
think
that
he
must
be
the
last
of
his
line
was
it
for
this
that
he
had
schemed
and
manœuvred
for
this
that
he
had
caused
lady
farrington
to
be
placed
under
restraint
had
abandoned
her
to
starve
then
followed
a
wave
of
better
feeling
towards
the
gallant
young
fellow
who
had
heaped
coals
of
fire
on
his
head
what
a
fine
action
it
was
how
splendidly
the
young
man
had
behaved
he
half
wished
that
herbert
was
really
the
heir
to
the
family
honours
now
that
there
was
no
one
else
to
inherit
them
upon
this
point
he
would
have
met
with
some
sharp
opposition
within
his
family
had
he
expressed
his
opinion
much
as
poor
ernest
was
regretted
by
all
there
were
some
who
after
the
first
decorous
mourning
found
themselves
quite
able
to
reconcile
themselves
to
his
loss
to
death
meant
a
certain
tangible
gain
she
could
never
succeed
to
the
baronetcy
certainly
but
there
were
the
broad
acres
of
farrington
which
de
would
now
undoubtedly
come
to
her
possibly
if
diggle
did
but
take
his
proper
place
in
life
and
could
be
persuaded
to
enter
parliament
a
grateful
government
might
be
brought
to
continue
the
baronetcy
through
the
female
branch
cavendish
would
have
been
only
too
pleased
that
her
infant
son
should
some
day
resume
the
name
and
arms
of
the
farrington
family
and
that
the
should
become
celebrated
as
the
proprietors
of
farrington
hall
the
son
was
forthcoming
indeed
more
than
one
but
poor
was
not
himself
quite
equal
to
the
task
which
the
ambitious
letitia
would
have
imposed
upon
him
the
gold
coast
campaign
in
fact
had
nearly
cost
him
his
life
and
had
left
him
almost
a
wreck
weeks
of
low
fever
upon
a
miserable
sickbed
in
the
malarious
bush
had
nearly
finished
him
and
long
before
the
end
of
the
war
he
had
returned
to
england
more
dead
than
alive
his
life
in
the
long
run
was
spared
but
the
once
smart
dandy
reappeared
a
broken
man
one
much
more
fitted
to
spend
the
remainder
of
his
days
in
european
health
resorts
drinking
the
waters
and
taking
the
baths
than
in
any
active
struggle
for
parliamentary
or
contested
family
honours
before
the
return
of
the
own
to
england
he
had
retired
upon
and
took
no
further
part
in
regimental
affairs
glorification
however
when
he
reached
england
duly
came
off
and
this
without
any
protest
on
the
part
of
she
did
not
know
really
that
he
was
or
had
ever
been
a
competitor
for
the
family
estates
besides
which
when
he
arrived
she
and
her
husband
were
at
aix
and
however
calmly
she
may
have
accepted
the
sad
news
of
death
she
could
not
openly
be
otherwise
than
pleased
at
the
honour
done
to
the
man
who
had
endeavoured
to
save
her
life
herbert
whether
or
no
was
invited
at
once
to
the
hall
whither
he
went
not
from
any
love
for
sir
rupert
but
simply
to
see
how
the
land
lay
and
whether
he
could
help
the
poor
old
dowager
who
still
languished
in
her
asylum
prison
yet
it
was
with
a
certain
strange
excitement
that
he
entered
the
house
which
might
be
and
which
somehow
he
felt
ought
to
be
his
the
baronet
received
him
most
courteously
poor
lady
farrington
fell
upon
his
neck
and
wept
torrents
of
tears
he
was
shown
into
a
gorgeous
guest
chamber
a
room
all
blue
satin
and
silver
such
as
he
had
never
before
seen
in
all
his
life
and
he
was
treated
with
the
most
profound
respect
on
every
side
lady
farrington
was
not
equal
to
appearing
at
table
and
he
dined
with
sir
rupert
his
host
questioned
him
closely
upon
the
events
of
the
campaign
acutely
painful
as
was
one
of
its
episodes
to
the
baronet
he
yet
seemed
to
ignore
this
and
was
only
anxious
to
give
his
guest
an
opportunity
of
describing
what
he
had
seen
possibly
he
was
anxious
also
to
keep
off
dangerous
ground
and
to
avoid
inconvenient
questions
upon
points
on
which
herbert
was
if
anything
far
more
closely
concerned
here
however
he
counted
without
his
host
the
young
soldier
was
by
nature
and
still
more
by
his
recent
rough
and
ready
training
little
disposed
to
beat
about
the
bush
he
had
resolved
upon
coming
to
farrington
hall
to
ascertain
what
could
be
done
to
release
the
old
lady
farrington
from
durance
he
had
had
already
one
or
two
communications
from
hanlon
none
of
which
however
gave
him
much
hope
of
effecting
this
without
the
assistance
of
the
baronet
himself
the
had
not
seen
much
of
the
old
lady
she
was
of
course
upon
the
female
side
of
the
asylum
but
hanlon
was
not
to
be
baulked
by
any
restrictions
of
sex
and
as
the
rules
of
the
establishment
forbade
him
from
attending
upon
a
female
patient
he
made
it
his
business
to
secure
the
of
a
female
attendant
the
person
who
had
especial
charge
of
lady
farrington
was
a
damsel
to
whom
the
blandishments
of
were
by
no
means
distasteful
through
this
impressionable
daughter
of
eve
hanlon
had
communicated
frequently
with
the
old
lady
he
had
told
her
of
progress
of
the
young
advancement
in
the
lower
walks
of
the
military
career
finally
of
the
ashanti
war
and
undoubted
success
had
the
doctor
been
within
easy
reach
he
might
have
ordered
lady
farrington
the
usual
cooling
regimen
so
excited
did
she
become
but
she
escaped
observation
and
under
the
advice
of
her
attendant
and
indeed
through
her
own
native
intelligence
she
managed
to
preserve
a
calm
exterior
feeling
sure
that
her
herbert
would
soon
appear
to
open
wide
her
prison
doors
that
he
was
most
eager
to
do
so
was
evident
from
his
conversation
with
sir
rupert
that
first
night
shall
be
only
too
glad
to
meet
your
wishes
in
any
way
the
baronet
had
said
the
horse
guards
perhaps
or
with
cardwell
will
not
ask
so
much
herbert
replied
have
been
already
treated
most
liberally
by
the
authorities
all
i
want
is
to
pay
a
visit
to
greystoke
sir
rupert
turned
rather
pale
and
with
you
you
see
i
know
everything
why
hesitate
sir
rupert
there
need
be
no
concealment
between
us
the
last
time
we
met
i
was
a
victim
one
of
your
victims
but
now
i
am
above
all
that
but
poor
lady
farrington
still
would
not
be
safe
i
assure
you
to
set
her
at
large
i
have
that
on
the
best
authority
she
is
still
quite
have
it
on
better
that
she
is
now
perfectly
i
ask
who
is
your
informant
sir
rupert
blandly
enquired
of
the
attendants
at
the
skilled
practitioner
a
medical
man
no
not
exactly
he
was
in
fact
formerly
in
the
a
surgeon
in
the
you
would
set
up
his
opinion
the
opinion
of
an
illiterate
untrained
man
against
that
of
the
highest
medical
authority
in
the
country
really
larkins
an
honest
straightforward
man
sir
rupert
with
plenty
of
common
sense
his
judgment
may
be
at
fault
but
at
any
rate
his
opinion
is
certain
to
be
unbiassed
and
unprejudiced
he
assures
me
that
lady
farrington
is
perfectly
fit
to
take
care
of
herself
and
ought
to
be
immediately
set
at
can
not
agree
with
your
friend
i
have
seen
her
only
within
these
last
few
days
and
i
think
she
is
as
bad
as
shall
refer
the
matter
then
to
one
of
the
lord
visitors
said
herbert
displaying
an
intimate
acquaintance
with
procedure
which
rather
surprised
sir
rupert
is
not
necessary
i
assure
you
if
the
poor
lady
is
capable
of
taking
care
of
herself
i
do
not
wish
to
detain
her
far
from
it
if
it
is
really
your
wish
to
visit
greystoke
larkins
we
will
go
there
and
thus
sir
rupert
farrington
consented
to
a
step
which
could
not
but
have
very
serious
consequences
to
himself
and
all
who
were
dependent
upon
him
chapter
iv
visitors
at
greystoke
greystoke
had
once
been
a
and
place
of
mark
in
the
county
of
hopshire
a
but
compact
mansion
with
thick
walls
and
a
wide
moat
it
still
looked
capable
of
withstanding
a
siege
not
that
there
was
any
chance
of
one
admission
was
not
difficult
to
obtain
provided
the
usual
formalities
were
observed
the
thing
was
to
get
out
again
when
you
had
once
got
in
the
natural
strength
of
the
place
made
it
nearly
as
secure
as
a
prison
but
no
bolts
or
bars
were
needed
if
the
stout
doors
and
numerous
gates
deep
moat
and
broad
haha
had
not
sufficed
there
was
behind
all
the
watchfulness
of
the
attendants
joe
hanlon
was
in
high
favour
at
greystoke
in
him
thanks
to
his
long
military
training
prompt
unhesitating
obedience
had
come
to
be
second
nature
all
orders
he
received
he
carried
out
implicitly
and
to
the
letter
he
was
as
plucky
too
as
he
was
punctual
and
he
could
always
be
relied
on
when
there
was
an
ugly
job
on
hand
hard
tough
and
resolute
he
was
ready
to
tackle
the
most
truculent
patient
and
brave
his
fiercest
rage
little
weakness
for
refreshment
might
have
done
him
harm
at
greystoke
but
his
superiors
at
the
asylum
were
not
as
keen
in
the
detection
of
unsteadiness
as
the
officers
of
the
own
and
when
joe
was
at
all
he
managed
to
keep
the
secret
to
himself
perhaps
as
a
valuable
servant
his
masters
were
often
conveniently
blind
as
a
person
of
some
authority
hanlon
was
at
liberty
to
go
where
he
pleased
in
the
establishment
one
morning
he
paid
a
visit
to
the
female
wing
and
asked
to
see
miss
ponting
morning
miss
how
is
she
he
went
on
at
once
and
with
no
little
excitement
in
his
voice
ladyship
like
a
lamb
amiss
hanlon
you
look
miss
duties
had
lain
for
some
years
with
the
most
aristocratic
patients
and
she
cultivated
a
refinement
of
language
and
a
fastidiousness
of
expression
which
imposed
upon
no
one
so
much
as
herself
but
for
the
firm
lines
of
her
mouth
and
steady
eye
traits
which
proved
her
fitness
for
her
present
employment
she
might
have
been
set
down
as
a
fat
foolish
woman
of
forty
with
the
airs
and
graces
of
girlhood
and
the
pretentiousness
of
one
who
sought
to
be
considered
superior
to
her
station
she
had
a
fine
eye
for
the
main
chance
however
and
this
had
led
her
to
listen
willingly
enough
to
blandishments
there
was
profit
perhaps
substantial
and
considerable
to
be
got
out
of
the
affair
coming
over
this
very
day
cried
hanlon
rupert
and
the
joe
had
already
given
herbert
promotion
partly
out
of
affection
and
partly
to
impress
miss
ponting
the
whole
kit
of
what
puts
you
in
such
a
taking
we
to
be
trampled
upon
like
the
sands
of
the
seashore
ready
for
anyone
that
chooses
to
is
the
captain
means
to
have
her
out
and
so
i
tell
you
and
all
depend
on
how
they
find
her
is
she
fit
to
be
seen
was
better
her
but
her
quite
and
her
temper
it
do
to
prepare
her
it
flurry
her
as
when
you
told
her
of
the
fight
on
the
coast
break
it
to
her
judgematically
and
with
with
a
composing
draught
tell
her
too
to
hold
her
tongue
she
is
mindful
of
what
i
say
always
and
answer
only
when
spoken
to
and
if
i
put
her
into
a
quiet
dress
and
keep
my
eye
on
her
come
through
all
right
or
call
me
jenny
say
call
you
a
brick
and
a
beauty
and
hanlon
or
anything
you
please
said
boy
in
high
glee
quite
a
genius
georgeyana
and
fight
the
man
who
says
you
the
visitors
arrived
punctually
at
eleven
fewster
the
proprietor
of
the
establishment
who
had
been
briefly
apprised
by
sir
rupert
received
them
in
state
in
his
he
was
a
man
of
a
not
uncommon
type
but
certain
peculiar
characteristics
were
very
strongly
developed
in
him
a
superficial
observer
after
five
talk
would
have
thought
him
one
of
the
pleasantest
men
in
the
world
the
moment
he
met
you
fewster
took
possession
of
you
and
began
to
dose
you
with
oil
not
that
known
in
the
profession
as
croton
or
castor
but
the
metaphorical
oil
of
compliment
and
flattery
very
thinly
disguised
if
he
had
not
taken
to
lunacy
he
might
have
made
a
fortune
in
general
practice
so
honeyed
were
his
accents
and
reassuring
his
tone
when
herbert
was
presented
to
him
fewster
put
out
his
hand
and
said
with
much
feeling
shake
hands
with
a
hero
is
indeed
an
honour
for
us
who
never
leave
our
armchairs
at
home
let
me
tell
you
larkins
such
deeds
as
yours
send
a
thrill
through
the
whole
country
and
we
are
proud
proud
to
call
you
one
of
all
this
time
he
held
hand
and
was
shaking
it
as
though
it
was
a
bottle
of
his
own
medicine
very
much
to
discomfort
who
inwardly
apostrophised
him
as
an
ass
a
humbug
and
a
cad
you
sir
rupert
how
pained
yet
how
pleased
you
must
have
been
to
welcome
him
home
to
have
thanked
him
for
his
devotion
ah
would
would
to
heaven
it
had
been
more
successful
fewster
turned
away
overcome
with
emotion
but
sir
rupert
who
knew
his
man
said
abruptly
have
come
on
business
i
understood
from
your
letter
although
you
did
not
exactly
specify
what
it
is
not
then
merely
to
visit
my
establishment
which
by
the
bye
i
should
be
only
happy
to
show
but
see
lady
this
gentleman
is
perhaps
acquainted
with
possibly
interested
in
the
case
larkins
said
sir
rupert
not
without
bitterness
an
old
friend
and
protégé
of
her
he
has
not
seen
her
for
some
years
in
fact
not
since
she
has
been
be
sure
to
be
sure
i
remember
now
and
the
doctor
looked
at
herbert
with
a
keen
cunning
glance
wondering
whether
there
was
anything
to
fear
from
that
quarter
have
not
yet
been
my
rounds
he
said
can
not
tell
how
her
ladyship
is
this
morning
but
if
she
is
presentable
there
are
times
you
understand
when
she
is
not
quite
quite
you
know
and
perhaps
larkins
thinks
that
there
may
be
some
mistake
that
the
poor
lady
is
not
what
you
fewster
and
what
we
all
imagine
he
has
heard
that
she
is
perfectly
quiet
and
i
ask
from
whom
herbert
did
not
reply
he
was
too
much
interested
in
the
door
at
which
he
was
looking
steadily
he
was
perhaps
expecting
some
one
one
in
the
establishment
sir
rupert
answered
for
him
my
establishment
can
it
be
possible
that
you
would
accept
any
evidence
but
my
own
i
forbear
to
ask
who
your
informant
may
in
his
own
secret
heart
he
was
registering
a
vow
to
discover
and
mentally
promising
the
culprit
a
very
short
shrift
i
need
hardly
say
that
information
surreptitiously
obtained
can
not
always
be
quite
relied
upon
nor
may
i
add
is
any
opinion
of
real
value
but
that
of
those
duly
accredited
and
i
must
maintain
mine
against
all
comers
save
and
except
the
great
lights
and
authorities
of
my
own
at
this
moment
a
servant
entered
with
a
card
which
fewster
took
up
carelessly
but
as
he
looked
at
it
his
demeanour
suddenly
changed
is
he
he
hurriedly
inquired
of
the
servant
my
study
or
has
he
gone
into
the
building
gentlemen
pray
forgive
me
but
this
is
a
visitor
whom
i
can
not
neglect
it
is
darlington
mayne
the
eminent
alienist
and
as
you
perhaps
are
aware
the
visitor
you
will
follow
me
i
trust
sir
rupert
looked
savagely
interrogative
at
herbert
as
though
to
inquire
whether
it
was
by
his
agency
that
this
great
official
had
appeared
so
opportunely
upon
the
scene
thought
it
would
be
more
satisfactory
to
all
parties
herbert
said
quite
calmly
friend
of
mine
is
an
intimate
friend
of
his
and
mayne
is
already
in
full
possession
of
all
the
facts
of
the
young
fellow
plays
his
game
closely
thought
the
doctor
as
he
left
the
room
young
villain
has
stolen
a
march
upon
me
thought
sir
rupert
and
so
herbert
evidently
had
fewster
was
a
little
nervous
when
he
met
the
great
man
who
without
waiting
for
the
proprietor
had
gone
at
once
into
lady
apartments
and
was
already
in
close
conversation
with
her
fewster
ah
i
wished
to
see
her
ladyship
began
mayne
rather
curtly
of
course
and
how
you
this
morning
my
dear
lady
inquired
the
asylum
doctor
well
perfectly
well
as
i
have
been
these
five
years
past
replied
lady
farrington
with
great
coolness
and
the
old
lady
had
aged
considerably
since
we
last
saw
her
her
hair
was
snow
white
there
was
a
sort
of
rather
mournful
expression
in
her
dark
eyes
which
one
sees
often
in
human
beings
and
all
who
have
been
long
in
captivity
and
have
but
little
hope
of
release
but
these
eyes
had
lost
none
of
their
brilliancy
and
she
sat
up
straight
in
her
chair
with
evident
signs
of
strength
and
vitality
still
unimpaired
the
great
news
which
the
attendant
had
communicated
to
her
but
an
hour
or
two
before
that
herbert
was
close
by
and
meant
to
get
her
out
somehow
had
put
new
life
into
her
ladyship
slept
well
went
on
fewster
visions
no
visitors
from
africa
lady
hands
trembled
and
a
sudden
gleam
flashed
from
her
eyes
but
she
saw
miss
ponting
looking
at
her
and
instantly
she
subsided
into
perfect
calm
the
reference
to
herbert
was
artfully
made
but
it
failed
never
see
visions
you
are
talking
nonsense
apparitions
no
ghostly
messages
from
missing
and
friends
lady
farrington
appeared
a
little
agitated
but
again
a
glance
from
miss
ponting
reassured
her
course
not
i
do
not
understand
you
in
the
from
herbert
larkins
he
has
given
you
no
warning
of
his
approaching
return
this
was
a
great
trial
to
her
ladyship
but
she
bore
it
wonderfully
well
a
greater
test
was
in
store
for
her
if
i
tell
you
he
is
close
at
hand
that
within
a
week
within
a
day
or
two
perhaps
you
may
see
him
again
the
poor
fortitude
for
a
moment
gave
way
mean
that
he
is
here
at
this
moment
actually
here
in
the
house
oh
let
me
see
him
my
sweet
sweet
boy
now
now
at
once
i
implore
you
then
she
stopped
suddenly
but
with
a
manifest
effort
and
turning
to
mayne
said
piteously
is
not
fair
it
is
cruel
to
work
upon
my
feelings
thus
this
is
the
subject
nearest
to
my
heart
and
he
knows
it
hoping
to
excite
me
and
make
me
appear
other
than
i
am
it
is
for
this
dear
boy
that
i
am
imprisoned
here
i
will
speak
this
was
in
answer
to
a
warning
gesture
from
miss
ponting
gentleman
is
a
government
visitor
he
has
said
so
come
here
on
purpose
to
do
me
justice
he
shall
hear
the
whole
story
from
beginning
to
end
and
he
will
know
then
that
i
have
been
the
victim
of
the
hardest
usage
and
foul
fewster
turned
to
mayne
with
a
meaning
look
which
plainly
implied
that
he
would
now
see
the
form
taken
by
lady
craze
this
was
her
weak
point
her
monomania
and
her
madness
would
soon
unmistakeably
be
betrayed
shall
tell
me
the
whole
story
lady
farrington
but
privately
and
in
your
own
way
i
wish
to
see
her
ladyship
alone
quite
mayne
spoke
very
quietly
he
was
an
undemonstrative
man
of
few
words
but
his
manner
and
tone
were
one
of
much
determination
and
authority
meanwhile
sir
rupert
and
herbert
left
to
themselves
had
exchanged
but
little
conversation
the
baronet
was
preoccupied
and
there
was
a
black
scowl
on
his
face
which
boded
ill
for
any
whom
his
anger
could
touch
herbert
was
silent
too
he
felt
that
he
had
thrown
away
the
scabbard
and
was
fighting
sir
rupert
to
the
death
the
moments
dragged
themselves
slowly
on
till
presently
fewster
returned
with
many
apologies
am
truly
grieved
to
have
kept
you
so
long
from
the
object
of
your
visit
the
fact
is
darlington
mayne
also
wished
to
see
lady
farrington
and
he
is
at
present
closeted
with
her
till
he
chooses
to
end
the
interview
we
can
not
disturb
him
of
it
was
quite
an
hour
later
when
mayne
joined
them
are
the
poor
friends
said
the
asylum
doctor
with
much
formality
rupert
farrington
herbert
larkins
of
the
mayne
bowed
very
coldly
to
sir
rupert
but
put
out
his
hand
to
herbert
mutual
friend
mccosh
has
often
spoken
to
me
of
you
that
was
a
noble
deed
of
yours
and
i
am
glad
to
know
you
lady
farrington
eagerly
interposed
herbert
as
soon
as
he
civilly
could
is
a
case
of
some
little
difficulty
i
am
really
rather
perplexed
her
ladyship
is
perfectly
sane
i
think
and
rational
except
on
one
point
if
i
could
but
obtain
some
independent
testimony
on
that
i
might
see
my
way
she
perseveres
in
asseverating
although
she
can
adduce
no
proofs
that
her
son
herbert
whom
she
has
not
seen
for
upwards
of
five
and
twenty
years
left
a
son
and
that
you
larkins
are
herbert
replied
slowly
and
with
an
air
of
the
deepest
conviction
is
perfectly
right
i
powers
cried
sir
rupert
starting
to
his
feet
and
foaming
with
rage
there
ever
such
matchless
effrontery
can
be
fully
substantiated
went
on
herbert
still
perfectly
calm
is
a
gross
and
unfounded
lie
from
beginning
to
end
a
conspiracy
an
attempt
to
that
the
law
can
only
judge
said
mayne
i
must
confess
assertion
so
far
satisfies
my
mind
that
i
feel
convinced
lady
farrington
is
not
suffering
from
any
hallucination
and
i
shall
recommend
her
immediate
can
not
must
not
my
life
would
be
in
peril
expostulated
sir
rupert
still
furious
but
rather
taken
aback
mind
is
quite
made
up
said
the
visitor
authoritatively
i
give
you
notice
went
on
herbert
behalf
of
lady
farrington
that
bellhouse
her
solicitor
will
forthwith
commence
an
action
against
you
for
illegal
detention
and
will
require
a
full
account
of
all
moneys
due
to
her
during
the
time
she
has
been
under
care
nothing
for
your
actions
cried
sir
rupert
snapping
his
fingers
if
i
spend
my
last
shilling
she
shall
not
go
at
but
he
was
compelled
to
give
way
the
law
was
too
strong
for
him
his
opponents
too
full
of
fight
and
that
they
meant
business
was
clear
from
an
advertisement
which
appeared
everywhere
directly
after
lady
farrington
was
set
free
it
was
as
follows
reward
to
anyone
who
will
give
authentic
proofs
of
marriage
about
between
herbert
farrington
corporal
smith
of
the
lancers
and
ann
daughter
of
josiah
orde
of
chapter
a
momentous
question
the
dowager
lady
farrington
after
long
years
of
grief
and
sorrow
had
chanced
at
last
upon
happier
days
her
cup
of
bliss
seemed
filled
now
to
overflowing
to
be
free
once
more
released
from
the
hateful
asylum
with
its
painful
associations
and
unbroken
restraint
was
in
itself
a
great
joy
that
herbert
was
restored
to
her
was
a
yet
greater
delight
but
greatest
of
all
was
the
knowledge
that
her
heart
had
not
misled
her
and
that
she
had
rightly
recognised
him
as
the
offspring
of
her
own
and
boy
herbert
had
told
her
the
story
as
he
had
had
it
from
larkins
and
the
statement
although
it
lacked
formal
legal
proof
was
more
than
sufficient
to
satisfy
her
mind
she
was
indeed
only
too
eager
to
believe
it
but
had
any
doubt
remained
it
would
have
been
more
than
removed
so
she
declared
by
the
living
extraordinary
resemblance
to
the
one
that
was
dead
and
gone
i
look
at
you
now
a
man
i
seem
to
see
my
own
poor
son
once
more
cried
the
old
lady
with
tears
of
joy
in
her
eyes
have
his
face
his
features
all
his
ways
even
the
colour
of
your
hair
and
of
your
eyes
is
the
same
you
are
a
farrington
every
inch
i
know
it
i
feel
it
and
everybody
else
shall
own
it
also
and
at
nothing
would
please
her
but
that
he
should
assume
without
loss
of
time
the
farrington
name
and
arms
not
yet
he
pleaded
am
not
entitled
to
you
not
my
grandson
who
shall
gainsay
that
know
it
and
i
glory
in
it
but
still
the
case
is
not
satisfactorily
proved
besides
if
i
am
to
take
the
name
of
farrington
at
all
it
can
only
be
as
the
head
of
the
sir
herbert
farrington
at
this
very
ought
to
be
perhaps
but
you
will
admit
that
to
say
so
positively
at
present
would
be
quite
premature
it
would
not
be
in
very
good
taste
either
and
i
had
much
rather
let
things
stay
as
they
to
this
lady
farrington
eventually
assented
but
not
with
the
best
grace
in
the
world
any
rate
everyone
shall
know
that
i
recognise
and
adopt
you
she
said
with
all
a
pertinacity
may
be
called
larkins
but
you
are
the
son
of
this
house
all
i
have
is
yours
now
if
you
wish
it
and
absolutely
so
after
i
am
and
to
prove
her
words
she
sought
in
spite
of
his
protestations
to
load
him
with
rich
gifts
her
ladyship
happily
had
ample
funds
at
her
disposal
whatever
sinister
motives
may
have
actuated
sir
rupert
in
locking
her
up
he
had
behaved
with
scrupulous
honesty
towards
her
effects
as
the
appointed
administrator
he
had
full
power
over
every
penny
of
hers
but
he
never
misappropriated
one
no
sooner
was
lady
farrington
at
large
than
he
rendered
an
exact
account
of
his
stewardship
to
bellhouse
and
the
balance
he
handed
over
was
very
satisfactory
indeed
out
of
this
lady
farrington
wished
to
make
large
settlements
at
once
upon
herbert
contenting
herself
with
her
jointure
which
would
amply
suffice
for
all
her
needs
as
before
but
she
attached
a
condition
that
he
should
retire
forthwith
from
the
profession
in
which
he
had
first
begun
to
climb
and
reside
with
her
devoting
himself
also
to
the
great
emprise
of
fully
establishing
his
claims
it
was
a
severe
struggle
for
the
young
man
on
the
one
side
gratitude
to
the
kind
benefactress
who
had
done
so
much
for
him
impelled
him
to
accept
the
offer
she
so
generously
made
on
the
other
his
affection
for
the
service
in
which
he
had
already
begun
to
rise
urged
him
as
strongly
to
reject
the
conditions
she
wished
to
impose
at
any
rate
he
begged
for
time
there
was
no
need
to
decide
in
a
hurry
he
had
still
six
leave
to
run
something
might
turn
up
to
support
his
case
some
answers
to
the
advertisement
some
news
of
the
missing
marriage
lines
lady
farrington
consented
gladly
enough
all
she
asked
was
that
he
should
remain
always
at
her
side
this
time
was
spent
in
london
whither
the
pair
had
come
immediately
after
lady
discharge
farrington
court
was
hateful
to
her
she
declared
and
for
obvious
reasons
it
was
too
near
the
hall
too
near
the
monster
who
had
cast
a
cloud
over
the
last
years
of
her
life
too
full
of
memories
she
desired
now
to
shut
out
for
ever
london
with
its
varied
interests
and
amusements
its
busy
life
and
stirring
ways
was
more
calculated
to
suit
lady
temper
than
a
seclusion
in
a
lonely
and
nearly
empty
country
place
bellhouse
had
therefore
secured
a
snug
house
in
a
mayfair
street
a
thoroughfare
noisy
with
carriages
gay
and
lively
always
with
people
passing
continually
to
and
fro
here
miss
ponting
had
also
been
installed
as
a
very
wise
precaution
which
served
to
keep
lady
farrington
always
quiet
was
also
one
of
the
household
he
had
given
himself
his
discharge
the
day
after
the
great
scene
at
the
asylum
having
done
the
business
entrusted
to
him
and
wishing
to
avoid
any
altercation
with
the
angry
and
suspicious
chief
position
in
was
not
at
first
quite
clearly
defined
but
beginning
as
he
lapsed
first
into
general
factotum
and
then
into
and
own
particular
man
his
appointment
was
rather
a
sinecure
beyond
cleaning
his
boots
to
which
he
gave
a
lustre
which
was
the
envy
of
every
shoeblack
whom
herbert
passed
in
the
streets
and
pipeclaying
his
kid
gloves
for
want
of
anything
better
on
which
to
try
his
hand
he
had
not
the
slightest
idea
of
the
duties
of
a
valet
and
herbert
had
as
little
knowledge
of
what
he
should
ask
hanlon
to
do
but
the
two
talked
constantly
together
of
old
times
they
compared
notes
of
past
experiences
discussed
old
comrades
each
other
and
wound
up
by
expressing
their
unbounded
and
unshaken
opinion
that
there
never
was
and
never
would
be
such
a
corps
in
any
army
in
the
civilised
world
as
the
own
when
they
came
to
this
point
heart
grew
heavy
and
he
sought
to
change
the
conversation
boy
after
a
little
saw
this
he
was
most
religiously
respectful
nowadays
jib
and
shirk
whenever
we
come
to
talk
of
the
old
corps
as
bad
as
the
colonel
when
a
goojerat
day
came
twice
in
the
same
week
up
sir
not
going
to
turn
your
back
upon
the
old
corps
just
where
it
is
joe
lady
farrington
wants
me
to
retire
and
live
always
with
you
only
just
got
your
commission
sir
and
be
adjutant
when
you
please
and
a
staff
officer
and
a
field
officer
and
a
general
officer
and
all
sorts
of
officers
rolled
into
one
before
you
be
got
a
grey
hair
with
you
sir
the
wildest
maddest
well
no
not
a
pleasant
word
to
use
in
this
house
but
you
do
it
sir
you
do
it
only
this
blessed
day
did
i
see
the
captain
greathed
him
colonel
now
you
know
and
he
axes
after
you
and
sez
he
is
he
pretty
stout
sez
he
and
sez
i
he
is
that
sez
i
and
be
coming
to
see
him
sez
he
and
i
hope
he
will
this
very
day
sez
i
for
a
folly
to
talk
to
him
sez
i
which
it
is
sez
he
i
mean
sez
i
but
fairly
bothered
like
johnny
raw
at
there
was
no
doubt
that
herbert
although
he
fought
against
it
was
chafing
much
at
his
present
life
if
it
was
to
be
all
like
this
he
would
willingly
in
preference
return
to
lady
kindness
was
great
and
unceasing
of
course
she
never
tired
of
expressing
her
affection
and
this
in
something
more
substantial
than
mere
words
he
had
at
the
best
a
park
hack
and
as
much
money
as
he
could
spend
for
a
time
all
this
was
pleasant
enough
it
was
his
first
experience
of
london
and
no
young
man
in
funds
is
likely
to
find
london
dull
but
it
is
possible
to
exhaust
its
amusements
after
a
time
especially
when
one
has
no
special
pursuits
and
no
hankering
after
shady
places
and
not
too
reputable
ways
there
was
no
vice
in
herbert
although
he
was
by
no
means
a
milksop
or
a
prig
but
he
knew
too
well
what
was
due
to
himself
to
lapse
into
the
inanities
which
prove
so
often
irresistible
to
other
young
men
it
did
not
satisfy
him
to
bet
and
haunt
the
theatres
and
loaf
about
the
burlington
arcade
other
and
more
rational
ways
of
employing
his
time
he
certainly
found
in
visiting
exhibitions
seeing
the
sights
and
more
especially
in
frequenting
the
united
service
institution
where
he
devoted
himself
for
several
hours
of
every
day
to
the
continued
study
of
the
profession
he
was
doomed
probably
and
unhappily
for
him
soon
to
leave
often
enough
too
he
satisfied
his
military
cravings
by
attending
the
guard
mounting
at
palace
he
was
weak
enough
sometimes
to
accompany
a
volunteer
regiment
on
its
way
to
the
park
for
drill
keeping
step
almost
intuitively
and
enjoying
the
whole
thing
far
more
than
anyone
in
the
crowd
but
all
these
did
not
half
suffice
to
exhaust
his
native
energy
developed
and
increased
as
it
had
been
by
his
recent
active
life
he
panted
continually
for
more
to
do
he
grew
more
and
more
hipped
and
out
of
joint
he
was
so
lonely
too
under
the
peculiar
circumstances
of
his
early
career
it
was
little
likely
that
he
would
have
many
acquaintances
of
his
own
age
he
might
perhaps
hunt
up
a
few
of
his
old
deadham
school
friends
but
school
friends
in
after
life
do
not
run
up
against
each
other
much
unless
they
have
been
at
eton
harrow
or
the
like
and
belong
of
right
to
the
great
world
he
had
no
club
as
yet
no
military
comrades
even
he
had
so
recently
passed
across
the
great
gulf
which
divides
the
commissioned
officer
from
the
rank
and
file
that
he
had
not
been
accepted
by
the
one
although
he
had
left
the
other
altogether
behind
nevertheless
he
kept
his
own
counsel
and
would
not
for
the
world
betray
to
lady
farrington
that
he
was
not
perfectly
contented
with
his
lot
it
would
have
been
but
a
poor
requital
for
all
her
kindness
he
said
and
he
must
put
the
best
face
upon
the
matter
even
that
greater
and
far
keener
trial
which
was
daily
growing
closer
and
closer
when
he
would
have
to
cut
himself
finally
adrift
from
his
profession
he
would
have
faced
as
he
had
met
other
really
greater
trials
like
a
man
but
he
was
spared
this
mainly
through
colonel
greathed
and
indirectly
also
through
the
first
came
without
delay
to
see
herbert
but
it
was
the
latter
who
had
induced
him
to
come
naturally
he
was
introduced
to
lady
farrington
who
welcomed
him
very
cordially
as
one
of
early
patrons
and
friends
has
been
a
rough
experience
for
my
grandson
said
the
old
lady
who
always
spoke
of
herbert
openly
as
a
relation
it
will
no
doubt
have
been
for
his
good
at
any
rate
it
is
over
now
and
herbert
will
live
like
a
gentleman
for
the
rest
of
his
and
a
gentleman
i
trust
said
colonel
greathed
laying
some
stress
on
the
first
word
not
exactly
he
has
promised
me
that
he
will
leave
the
service
at
will
be
taken
up
and
shot
as
a
deserter
the
very
next
day
said
the
colonel
with
mock
seriousness
but
the
old
lady
took
the
statement
pied
de
la
really
mean
that
she
asked
nervously
course
not
put
in
herbert
mean
that
he
is
and
must
always
be
a
soldier
at
heart
in
him
part
of
his
nature
and
he
put
it
off
like
a
slipper
or
a
lady
farrington
looked
hard
at
the
colonel
as
if
to
grasp
his
meaning
more
thoroughly
then
turned
her
eyes
interrogatively
upon
herbert
have
never
said
a
word
of
this
herbert
my
sweet
boy
you
have
expressed
no
regrets
have
offered
no
objections
herbert
hung
his
head
rather
and
hesitated
to
speak
it
be
possible
that
i
have
prayed
you
to
take
a
step
which
is
distasteful
to
you
selfish
old
wretch
that
i
am
no
grandmother
it
is
not
so
i
would
do
this
and
far
more
to
gratify
your
slightest
wish
i
will
leave
the
service
gladly
i
care
to
remain
in
it
i
i
can
not
quite
trust
to
what
you
say
i
shall
ask
colonel
greathed
to
tell
me
the
exact
truth
will
you
leave
us
alone
together
and
come
back
in
half
an
hour
her
ladyship
pressed
the
colonel
very
closely
she
begged
him
to
speak
openly
and
without
reserve
in
order
to
invite
confidence
she
detailed
the
whole
of
the
circumstances
connected
with
birth
and
parentage
she
enlarged
upon
his
possible
prospects
and
the
importance
of
his
always
being
at
home
to
advance
them
what
she
scarcely
referred
to
brave
old
soul
was
the
pleasure
she
would
derive
from
his
constant
companionship
you
ask
my
advice
lady
farrington
said
colonel
greathed
should
say
leave
him
to
follow
his
profession
it
will
be
no
hindrance
to
him
in
prosecuting
his
claims
and
should
these
fail
as
i
apprehend
is
just
possible
he
may
nevertheless
achieve
an
excellent
position
for
himself
his
bent
is
so
strongly
marked
he
is
so
promising
a
young
soldier
he
has
already
done
so
well
he
is
i
firmly
believe
so
keen
and
eager
to
continue
in
his
career
that
i
think
it
would
be
unfair
to
himself
to
his
friends
to
the
country
he
serves
to
baulk
him
and
turn
him
lady
farrington
was
much
moved
her
eyes
were
full
of
tears
and
she
could
hardly
speak
will
pain
you
i
fear
to
part
with
him
you
will
miss
him
greatly
i
have
no
doubt
still
such
partings
are
only
and
when
they
are
for
a
young
good
are
right
colonel
greathed
and
i
am
half
ashamed
of
myself
for
my
selfish
weakness
but
i
can
hold
out
no
she
wiped
her
eyes
and
sent
for
herbert
is
settled
and
in
the
way
to
please
you
best
i
feel
sure
you
shall
continue
in
the
calling
you
have
chosen
my
brave
boy
it
must
and
shall
be
so
i
have
not
many
years
to
live
but
i
pray
god
will
spare
me
until
i
see
you
righted
i
hope
but
at
any
rate
on
the
high
road
to
she
kissed
him
tenderly
on
the
forehead
as
if
to
sign
the
agreement
thus
you
will
not
leave
me
just
yet
she
said
almost
piteously
need
not
go
back
to
the
regiment
directly
colonel
greathed
not
not
till
october
when
we
embark
for
gibraltar
again
i
shall
want
him
to
take
the
adjutancy
chapter
vi
back
on
the
rock
as
october
approached
and
with
it
the
time
for
rejoining
his
regiment
herbert
became
more
and
more
eager
and
excited
he
was
quite
angry
with
himself
for
being
so
pleased
it
seemed
such
base
ingratitude
to
lady
farrington
to
be
so
delighted
to
leave
her
but
he
was
not
that
in
the
least
he
felt
an
increasing
regard
for
her
which
promised
to
develop
some
day
into
deep
affection
he
was
only
overjoyed
at
the
prospect
of
once
more
resuming
his
work
those
who
have
been
long
in
regular
harness
can
best
realize
how
flat
stale
and
unprofitable
is
life
without
a
fixed
object
and
employment
more
or
less
constant
from
morning
till
night
neither
by
inclination
nor
by
his
recent
training
was
herbert
of
the
sort
to
eat
the
bread
of
idleness
or
be
satisfied
with
having
nothing
to
do
therefore
it
was
that
when
his
adieux
were
made
and
the
poor
old
lady
left
to
her
solitary
grief
herbert
returned
to
soldiering
with
all
the
vigour
and
elasticity
of
a
steel
spring
which
has
been
set
free
he
could
never
forget
all
he
owed
his
first
patron
and
firm
friend
he
meant
to
spend
a
certain
portion
of
his
time
with
her
still
he
would
go
to
her
always
gladly
and
with
the
utmost
alacrity
when
she
expressed
a
wish
to
see
him
or
desired
to
have
him
at
her
side
but
in
spite
of
all
he
was
like
a
schoolboy
just
released
from
school
the
expiration
of
his
leave
and
his
return
to
duty
which
is
to
some
officers
such
an
inexpressible
bore
was
to
him
a
source
of
the
most
unfeigned
delight
yet
it
was
not
without
a
certain
trepidation
that
he
prepared
to
take
up
his
new
position
how
would
his
brother
officers
receive
him
would
they
accept
him
as
one
of
themselves
he
remembered
certainly
that
when
the
news
of
his
promotion
first
reached
the
coast
all
had
congratulated
him
warmly
and
made
many
cordial
and
civil
speeches
declaring
him
to
be
an
honour
to
the
own
but
these
were
days
of
abnormal
excitement
a
sharp
campaign
was
barely
ended
and
active
service
does
much
to
sweep
away
formality
and
level
class
distinctions
it
would
be
different
now
perhaps
at
an
expensive
and
brilliant
mess
in
a
gay
garrison
town
where
social
life
was
always
bubbling
up
and
boiling
over
in
festive
gatherings
days
with
the
calpe
hounds
theatricals
and
balls
herbert
had
no
particular
craving
for
these
joys
but
would
he
be
freely
admitted
and
readily
welcomed
everywhere
might
not
some
unmindful
of
the
fact
that
he
had
a
education
and
that
possibly
his
birth
if
he
got
his
rights
was
better
than
theirs
be
disposed
to
look
down
upon
him
and
despise
him
as
a
man
who
had
from
the
ranks
herbert
was
little
acquainted
with
the
tempers
and
idiosyncrasies
of
british
officers
although
long
associated
with
them
it
had
been
only
as
an
inferior
separated
from
them
by
a
wide
gulf
and
he
saw
only
what
was
on
the
surface
often
an
arrogant
manner
and
a
air
he
did
not
know
that
at
bottom
they
were
honest
and
fellows
full
of
prejudices
not
all
newtons
perhaps
or
john
stuart
mills
but
straightforward
honourable
men
who
were
in
the
habit
of
taking
their
comrades
just
as
they
found
them
and
just
for
what
they
were
worth
there
may
be
snobs
who
will
kotow
to
a
son
or
revolve
as
satellites
round
a
wealthy
young
but
the
general
verdict
of
a
british
mess
upon
the
individuals
who
compose
it
is
based
always
upon
their
intrinsic
qualities
and
personal
claims
the
own
were
not
long
in
finding
out
that
herbert
larkins
was
man
of
the
right
sort
thorough
good
chap
all
they
saw
not
without
surprise
perhaps
that
he
took
his
place
among
them
quite
naturally
almost
as
though
to
the
manner
born
he
behaved
quite
properly
at
the
he
did
not
eat
peas
with
a
knife
or
drink
with
his
mouth
full
he
could
take
his
share
in
the
conversation
never
very
abstruse
or
wide
in
its
range
and
that
without
dropping
his
or
miscalling
his
words
he
could
do
most
things
too
play
cricket
and
racquets
shoot
ride
or
play
a
rubber
of
whist
above
all
he
had
a
pleasant
face
and
a
genial
manner
with
a
smile
and
a
civil
word
for
all
who
spoke
to
him
whether
on
duty
or
off
this
last
was
almost
sufficient
recommendation
in
itself
especially
when
found
in
the
adjutant
as
it
was
in
case
colonel
greathed
was
not
a
commanding
officer
to
be
led
by
the
nose
he
drove
his
own
coach
and
had
his
team
always
well
in
hand
but
even
under
his
the
adjutant
was
as
he
must
always
be
a
considerable
personage
he
really
wields
much
power
he
is
the
usual
channel
of
communication
with
the
colonel
through
him
officers
apply
for
leave
or
other
indulgences
he
keeps
the
duty
roster
and
can
if
he
pleases
do
even
the
oldest
a
good
turn
by
carrying
out
exchanges
and
substituting
one
name
for
another
even
at
the
eleventh
hour
over
the
prisoners
he
exercises
the
sway
of
a
and
pedagogue
combined
he
can
prolong
to
a
maddening
length
and
upon
his
good
or
evil
report
much
of
their
happiness
depends
with
the
officers
and
rank
and
file
the
adjutant
is
generally
an
irresponsible
autocrat
and
king
he
holds
the
sergeants
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
the
colonel
nearly
always
relies
upon
him
to
recommend
men
for
promotion
and
it
is
he
who
brings
forward
deserving
private
soldiers
and
raises
them
out
of
the
ruck
all
this
tends
to
make
his
position
dangerously
full
of
snares
he
may
easily
become
puffed
up
and
conceited
worse
still
and
this
is
especially
noticeable
in
adjutants
who
have
risen
from
the
ranks
he
may
drift
into
favouritism
and
by
reason
of
his
intimate
acquaintance
with
the
ins
and
outs
of
military
life
fall
into
the
error
of
knowing
too
much
and
seeing
too
much
that
herbert
steered
clear
of
all
the
hidden
rocks
which
threaten
the
course
was
the
best
testimony
to
his
worth
although
he
never
swerved
from
his
duty
no
adjutant
could
have
been
more
generally
popular
the
days
passed
evenly
and
pleasantly
enough
they
were
happy
days
for
herbert
which
he
remembered
always
in
his
after
life
busy
days
beginning
with
the
fresh
morning
hours
when
he
took
the
battalion
out
for
early
drill
and
ending
with
the
inspection
of
the
officers
at
tattoo
parade
in
a
fortress
bristling
with
sentries
in
a
place
where
liquor
unfortunately
is
cheap
much
correspondence
and
many
intricate
returns
in
a
garrison
fully
provided
with
the
regulation
number
of
staff
officers
all
these
kept
him
close
till
it
was
long
past
then
there
was
afternoon
parade
more
writing
the
drill
of
young
officers
and
a
few
recruits
or
awkward
squads
and
the
day
was
well
advanced
before
he
could
call
himself
really
free
but
there
were
few
days
when
he
did
not
find
time
for
a
smart
canter
along
the
beach
of
gibraltar
bay
the
rotten
row
of
the
rock
or
for
a
longer
ramble
upon
the
slopes
below
the
queen
of
chair
or
on
the
san
roque
road
and
towards
the
cork
wood
now
and
again
but
rarely
and
chiefly
when
the
meet
was
near
at
hand
he
gave
himself
a
and
spent
many
enjoyable
hours
with
the
calpe
hounds
it
was
his
first
taste
of
hunting
and
although
not
quite
of
the
best
perhaps
it
was
a
pleasant
introduction
to
the
mysteries
of
sport
there
was
always
the
fair
landscape
lying
bright
under
the
southern
sky
the
change
and
movement
through
the
fresh
air
the
cheerful
companionship
of
a
field
of
people
whom
the
outing
with
its
short
runs
and
rapid
gallops
thoroughly
amused
ladies
not
many
certainly
but
all
very
ardent
followers
of
the
chase
invariably
attend
the
meets
of
the
calpe
hounds
herbert
saw
them
each
with
her
little
band
of
devoted
attendants
for
ladies
are
scarce
at
gibraltar
and
all
who
have
the
smallest
pretensions
to
please
can
always
count
upon
a
court
of
their
own
herbert
owed
allegiance
to
none
of
the
reigning
queens
he
had
no
leisure
for
flirting
and
philandering
nor
did
he
much
enjoy
the
afternoon
tea
or
small
and
early
dance
when
he
was
out
with
the
hounds
therefore
he
ranged
about
alone
or
with
some
male
companion
of
his
own
sort
he
had
hardly
a
bowing
acquaintance
with
any
one
of
the
fair
sex
upon
the
rock
and
it
was
with
no
little
surprise
that
he
found
himself
one
day
greeted
with
a
nod
and
a
most
friendly
smile
by
one
whom
for
the
moment
he
did
not
seem
to
know
it
was
miss
prioleau
the
general
with
his
wife
and
daughter
had
been
away
on
leave
in
england
when
the
own
returned
to
gibraltar
they
had
only
been
back
a
few
days
when
herbert
thus
again
encountered
his
little
friend
edith
for
the
first
time
he
raised
his
hat
and
would
have
ridden
on
but
the
general
himself
came
up
with
outstretched
hand
me
larkins
to
congratulate
you
as
one
of
the
old
regiment
i
take
a
pride
in
any
one
who
has
contributed
to
its
credit
you
have
done
so
and
right
well
i
am
glad
to
think
you
have
met
with
your
indeed
put
in
the
sweet
voice
of
the
daughter
and
somehow
the
simple
words
were
far
more
grateful
to
ears
than
the
sonorous
praises
which
fell
from
her
lips
indeed
larkins
it
was
a
noble
action
and
we
are
all
proud
of
the
bright
maiden
had
now
grown
into
the
fair
and
more
staid
and
but
winsome
girl
yet
she
was
the
same
attractive
little
person
no
less
engaging
and
far
more
dangerous
now
in
her
budding
womanly
beauty
than
when
he
had
seen
her
last
still
almost
a
child
in
her
white
habit
patronising
him
at
the
inspection
and
metaphorically
patting
him
on
the
back
herbert
muttered
a
few
words
in
acknowledgment
of
the
courteous
approval
edith
he
thanked
by
a
grateful
look
which
had
perhaps
more
meaning
in
it
than
he
intended
or
that
she
exactly
liked
do
believe
they
have
found
father
she
cried
and
as
she
spoke
there
was
a
sudden
stir
and
bustle
at
the
far
end
of
the
field
next
moment
came
the
whimper
of
a
hound
then
the
cheering
voice
of
the
huntsman
then
the
twang
of
a
horn
then
a
whole
chorus
of
voices
for
out
here
everyone
acted
as
amateur
whip
and
unprofessional
aid
swelling
up
into
a
grand
volume
of
sound
ga
wn
a
way
it
promised
to
be
a
capital
burst
they
had
been
drawing
the
white
house
covert
and
the
fox
headed
for
the
majarambu
woods
the
country
was
rough
now
and
again
you
came
to
a
precipice
like
the
side
of
a
house
next
to
a
long
slope
studded
as
it
might
be
with
the
great
boulders
of
an
old
world
glacier
or
moraine
then
broad
uplands
clothed
with
broad
tufts
of
the
gum
cistus
just
high
enough
to
oblige
your
horse
to
take
them
in
a
series
of
quick
jumps
not
always
very
easy
to
sit
the
pace
was
good
the
going
difficult
and
an
unusual
thing
the
run
was
protracted
for
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
ere
long
the
field
began
to
tail
off
and
presently
there
were
very
few
people
in
the
first
flight
bill
ackroyd
the
huntsman
was
one
so
was
the
herbert
also
and
edith
prioleau
but
without
her
papa
the
general
had
got
into
difficulties
at
a
wide
drain
where
as
some
irreverent
subalterns
remarked
it
was
to
be
hoped
he
might
stay
at
least
beyond
the
following
saturday
so
that
they
might
escape
the
usual
weekly
upon
the
north
front
in
the
exuberant
enjoyment
of
galloping
at
top
speed
over
a
country
edith
had
all
but
forgotten
the
existence
of
her
father
no
doubt
he
would
turn
up
at
the
first
check
runs
were
not
so
plentiful
and
this
one
was
far
too
good
to
lose
she
meant
to
see
it
out
to
the
very
last
not
quite
there
must
be
accidents
sometimes
as
the
spanish
journals
say
when
describing
and
all
at
once
horse
a
not
too
surefooted
barb
put
his
foot
in
a
hole
and
he
and
his
rider
came
down
together
over
and
over
they
rolled
on
the
top
and
close
to
the
margin
of
the
steep
cliff
a
mass
as
it
seemed
to
terrified
eyes
of
habit
light
curls
black
hoofs
gray
mane
and
tail
quick
as
lightning
he
had
dismounted
and
gone
to
the
rescue
how
he
managed
he
never
remembered
but
by
a
great
effort
and
as
he
thought
after
the
lapse
of
nearly
an
age
of
time
he
succeeded
in
disengaging
miss
prioleau
from
her
horse
she
had
fainted
her
face
was
blanched
quite
white
a
small
stream
of
crimson
was
trickling
from
one
temple
as
though
she
had
received
a
mortal
hurt
to
bring
water
in
his
from
a
spring
hard
by
to
sprinkle
her
brow
and
chafe
her
hands
was
all
that
herbert
could
do
until
the
arrival
of
a
number
of
others
among
whom
were
one
or
two
eager
but
officious
ladies
and
the
affrighted
general
to
them
he
resigned
his
charge
but
he
waited
anxiously
a
little
way
off
to
hear
how
it
fared
with
the
poor
girl
happily
she
soon
came
to
the
shock
of
her
fall
had
deprived
her
of
consciousness
a
small
stone
had
hit
her
forehead
but
these
were
the
worst
injuries
she
had
endured
very
soon
she
was
able
to
remount
her
horse
and
ride
slowly
home
herbert
felt
first
a
little
neglected
although
as
he
told
himself
he
had
really
no
reason
to
expect
any
extravagant
thanks
probably
no
one
knew
that
it
was
he
who
had
extricated
miss
prioleau
from
her
perilous
predicament
the
general
and
his
daughter
least
of
all
and
what
did
it
matter
if
they
did
the
service
was
a
very
trifling
one
after
all
and
he
had
only
done
what
any
other
man
would
have
done
in
his
place
he
was
quite
wrong
however
in
supposing
that
those
whom
he
had
served
were
ungrateful
next
morning
came
a
formal
but
most
letter
of
thanks
from
the
general
and
with
it
a
letter
from
prioleau
repeating
her
phrases
and
winding
up
with
a
very
friendly
invitation
to
dine
at
an
early
day
herbert
gladly
accepted
full
of
joy
at
the
prospect
of
meeting
miss
prioleau
again
he
hardly
considered
how
far
the
acquaintance
if
allowed
to
ripen
was
likely
to
affect
his
peace
of
mind
chapter
vii
the
course
of
true
love
to
the
young
military
officer
in
whom
the
reverential
spirit
is
not
entirely
quenched
the
british
general
is
often
a
very
awful
person
indeed
a
halo
of
professional
glory
surrounds
the
great
man
strange
powers
particularly
as
to
leave
are
vested
in
him
his
frequent
frown
is
terrific
his
occasional
smile
fails
to
reassure
to
the
officer
whose
early
days
were
spent
in
the
ranks
and
who
has
never
seen
the
general
behind
the
scenes
so
to
speak
as
an
english
gentleman
no
better
than
others
of
his
class
the
formidable
effect
is
intensified
and
a
great
gulf
seems
to
separate
the
two
it
was
with
a
shy
feeling
and
rather
a
sinking
heart
that
herbert
presented
himself
at
line
wall
house
the
residence
of
the
commanding
but
he
found
himself
among
friends
even
on
the
threshold
an
orderly
sergeant
one
of
the
own
of
course
and
a
former
comrade
took
his
coat
and
forage
cap
and
the
servant
who
ushered
him
into
the
was
also
an
old
soldier
of
the
regiment
disguised
in
livery
who
seemed
to
be
the
herald
of
a
triumphal
procession
as
he
threw
wide
the
doors
and
with
stentorian
lungs
announced
larkins
the
friendliness
was
not
however
confined
to
the
attendants
the
manner
was
most
frank
and
kindly
as
he
came
forward
and
shook
hands
prioleau
a
but
very
languid
personage
also
greeted
him
quite
warmly
for
her
while
edith
received
him
with
such
bright
eyes
and
heightened
colour
conveying
thanks
and
welcome
all
in
one
that
for
the
moment
he
felt
quite
overcome
it
was
a
small
party
of
eight
carefully
chosen
probably
with
the
idea
of
making
herbert
thoroughly
at
home
another
subaltern
like
himself
but
newly
married
with
a
pretty
girlish
cipher
of
a
wife
and
a
who
proved
to
be
ashanti
friend
the
captain
mountcharles
a
relation
of
the
family
made
up
the
number
edith
fell
to
herbert
on
going
in
to
dinner
on
her
other
side
at
the
table
was
the
who
according
to
custom
took
the
bottom
the
general
being
at
the
other
end
and
prioleau
in
the
centre
on
the
right
the
talk
at
dinner
was
not
particularly
lively
at
first
prioleau
never
contributed
much
the
general
was
really
a
little
shy
himself
especially
with
people
whom
he
did
not
know
intimately
edith
was
rather
silent
and
the
rest
of
the
company
seemingly
abashed
all
but
one
the
exception
was
captain
mountcharles
whose
duty
it
was
no
less
than
his
inclination
to
make
himself
agreeable
and
he
acquitted
himself
very
well
of
his
task
he
was
a
very
young
gentleman
rather
disposed
to
be
overdressed
and
with
a
somewhat
supercilious
air
the
first
showed
itself
in
the
splendour
of
his
with
its
single
stud
as
large
as
a
in
his
enormous
shirt
cuffs
which
he
with
a
little
concerted
cough
just
before
he
made
a
new
remark
in
the
breadth
of
his
black
satin
tie
and
in
the
size
of
his
watch
chain
which
had
it
been
long
enough
would
have
made
a
cable
for
a
the
latter
was
to
be
seen
in
his
drawling
accents
and
his
tendency
to
depreciate
everybody
and
everything
herbert
hated
him
almost
instinctively
from
the
first
but
his
dislike
was
deepened
by
his
seeming
familiarity
with
edith
whom
he
called
by
her
christian
name
she
was
his
cousin
so
it
was
all
right
enough
but
it
jarred
on
herbert
all
the
same
poor
sport
said
the
to
the
general
did
not
miss
much
sir
you
out
were
you
larkins
punctiliously
polite
to
herbert
as
to
an
inferior
another
reason
for
hatred
anyone
can
hunt
here
after
the
shires
never
hunted
in
the
shires
gaston
so
come
said
downright
edith
beg
your
pardon
edith
i
did
several
seasons
while
you
were
still
at
prioleau
never
went
to
school
i
think
put
in
herbert
and
she
turned
on
him
with
a
bright
smile
you
remember
that
day
i
never
was
so
bothered
i
think
french
is
certainly
the
most
difficult
and
detestable
of
i
always
thought
herbert
said
speak
french
larkins
asked
the
rather
impertinently
a
fashion
that
of
deadham
school
pray
do
you
at
deadham
went
on
captain
mountcharles
rather
shirking
the
question
and
seeming
to
imply
that
a
man
who
had
been
in
the
ranks
had
no
right
to
any
education
at
all
were
at
more
schools
than
that
i
take
it
larkins
said
saw
you
in
one
and
a
hot
where
you
were
the
head
and
dux
of
the
were
at
school
together
then
prioleau
asked
civilly
but
she
was
evidently
too
apathetic
to
care
about
the
reply
played
together
prioleau
not
with
hoop
or
ball
or
peg
tops
but
at
the
great
game
of
i
presume
the
general
said
idea
of
calling
that
a
war
sir
interposed
our
bumptious
picnic
would
be
a
better
was
not
a
picnic
under
the
usual
circumstances
at
any
rate
herbert
said
quietly
as
one
entitled
to
speak
foiegras
and
hothouse
grapes
perhaps
went
on
mountcharles
you
must
admit
that
the
whole
thing
was
monstrously
how
you
say
so
cried
edith
quite
eagerly
the
honours
too
look
how
they
were
overdone
why
there
were
more
rewards
than
for
of
them
were
richly
deserved
one
in
particular
which
i
could
mention
replied
edith
with
the
air
of
a
champion
defending
the
right
everyone
who
gets
the
chance
to
deserve
them
said
mountcharles
rather
sulkily
he
had
never
seen
a
shot
fired
himself
and
bore
malice
in
his
heart
to
all
who
had
had
better
luck
who
would
make
the
most
of
it
if
they
had
edith
retorted
sharply
adding
in
a
low
voice
i
quite
hate
you
how
disagreeable
you
for
the
remainder
of
the
evening
she
made
him
conscious
of
her
high
displeasure
mountcharles
and
she
had
hitherto
been
the
most
excellent
friends
an
may
be
and
mountcharles
certainly
was
the
very
tamest
of
cats
he
had
other
claims
besides
those
of
cousinship
to
be
well
received
with
an
only
daughter
young
lively
and
exceedingly
attractive
both
the
general
and
prioleau
had
realised
the
inconvenience
and
possible
danger
of
having
a
man
continually
about
the
house
unless
he
were
in
every
way
an
eligible
edith
had
plenty
of
time
before
her
no
doubt
but
at
her
age
girls
are
impressionable
and
very
apt
to
succumb
to
the
first
comer
if
he
has
many
opportunities
of
being
at
her
side
mountcharles
had
been
specially
selected
as
by
prioleau
who
in
spite
of
her
languid
airs
was
a
shrewd
woman
and
she
felt
that
if
anything
were
to
happen
at
least
they
were
safe
with
gaston
mountcharles
his
father
was
dead
and
he
had
an
excellent
competence
of
his
own
he
was
a
man
of
good
birth
thoroughly
presentable
in
every
way
edith
if
she
could
only
like
him
might
do
very
much
worse
but
this
night
it
was
clear
edith
did
not
like
him
at
all
not
that
mountcharles
much
cared
he
had
probably
far
too
good
an
opinion
of
himself
to
be
cast
down
by
the
snubbings
of
a
girl
still
in
her
teens
whether
or
no
he
took
her
treatment
of
him
very
much
to
heart
does
not
however
concern
my
readers
so
much
as
her
behaviour
to
the
hero
of
my
story
to
herbert
larkins
that
evening
she
was
gracious
and
engaging
in
the
extreme
she
made
him
talk
to
her
on
subjects
he
would
probably
know
best
she
listened
to
him
with
that
close
attention
which
is
in
itself
a
subtle
compliment
particularly
when
coming
from
an
attractive
girl
and
she
smiled
her
approval
in
that
frank
straightforward
way
which
might
be
interpreted
one
way
but
which
in
her
perhaps
meant
nothing
at
all
the
effect
upon
herbert
was
marked
and
almost
instantaneous
he
was
in
truth
little
accustomed
to
the
fascinations
of
the
fair
sex
he
had
never
been
brought
up
to
flirt
and
philander
to
roam
from
flower
to
flower
inhaling
fragrance
and
passing
gaily
on
and
he
fell
at
once
deeply
and
desperately
in
love
his
heart
went
out
at
once
to
the
daughter
without
for
a
moment
considering
whether
his
passion
was
likely
to
be
returned
it
was
not
perhaps
exactly
wise
a
man
more
versed
in
the
ways
of
the
world
would
have
been
a
little
more
cautious
and
circumspect
edith
prioleau
counted
her
swains
by
the
score
young
ladies
with
the
great
gift
of
beauty
of
good
birth
and
not
without
brains
pleasant
talkers
good
dancers
forward
riders
are
not
too
common
in
english
society
on
the
rock
among
the
few
belles
of
the
place
edith
prioleau
easily
carried
off
the
palm
and
she
had
always
a
crowd
of
admirers
about
her
she
did
not
resent
or
reject
their
attentions
on
the
contrary
she
honoured
them
all
with
her
favour
in
turn
and
enjoyed
it
amazingly
feeling
no
doubt
that
they
meant
nothing
any
more
than
she
did
and
that
therefore
she
did
no
particular
harm
young
soldiers
are
reputed
susceptible
but
it
is
also
true
that
if
knocked
over
and
quite
hopeless
one
day
they
are
generally
quite
the
next
herbert
larkins
was
not
a
man
of
this
sort
he
was
in
sober
serious
earnest
from
the
first
he
was
like
a
slave
grovelling
at
her
feet
she
might
trample
on
him
and
spurn
him
if
she
pleased
but
he
was
hers
always
whether
she
would
have
him
or
no
the
worst
of
it
was
that
he
could
not
hide
his
feelings
he
was
too
honest
he
had
not
enough
of
what
the
world
calls
what
did
he
care
who
knew
he
was
not
ashamed
of
his
weakness
it
was
not
a
passing
fancy
but
a
strong
attachment
a
affection
which
would
last
as
long
as
he
lived
everybody
saw
it
his
like
good
comrades
realising
how
much
his
heart
was
in
it
forebore
to
chaff
him
and
take
him
to
task
the
garrison
generally
and
all
smiled
or
winked
knowingly
when
he
was
observed
dancing
attendance
on
edith
looking
the
picture
of
misery
unless
she
threw
him
a
word
captain
mountcharles
saw
it
so
at
last
did
the
general
and
his
wife
edith
herself
least
of
all
could
not
be
blind
to
devotion
which
had
in
it
much
of
the
unswerving
unquestioning
attachment
of
the
dog
that
follows
at
heels
in
all
probability
she
would
have
been
overcome
by
it
already
that
pity
which
is
proverbially
akin
to
a
much
warmer
sentiment
had
taken
possession
of
her
and
she
was
in
a
fair
way
to
be
won
had
herbert
pricked
up
courage
to
speak
parents
were
growing
a
trifle
uneasy
at
attentions
the
general
did
not
take
much
notice
but
a
woman
is
so
much
more
worldly
in
these
matters
prioleau
did
you
see
robert
she
said
at
length
is
going
on
right
under
our
noses
edith
i
mean
and
this
larkins
i
have
had
my
suspicions
but
what
matter
can
not
things
take
their
course
to
such
a
match
for
edith
robert
you
must
be
the
general
had
seldom
seen
his
wife
so
excited
before
is
a
very
rising
young
has
already
risen
from
the
ranks
it
will
never
do
i
have
no
false
pride
about
me
i
think
but
it
is
right
to
draw
the
line
somewhere
but
even
if
there
were
no
other
objections
that
of
means
ought
to
suffice
what
are
they
to
live
upon
his
pay
ridiculous
and
can
not
be
dependent
on
his
pay
he
lives
well
keeps
horses
and
makes
altogether
too
good
a
show
i
have
heard
rumours
of
some
rich
old
lady
in
the
background
who
has
made
him
her
story
might
not
quite
bear
investigation
said
prioleau
drily
know
nothing
about
larkins
where
he
comes
from
or
to
whom
he
had
no
idea
you
were
so
keen
sophia
i
confess
i
like
the
lad
however
speak
to
edith
if
you
feel
that
it
is
necessary
i
leave
it
all
to
it
was
while
prioleau
waited
her
opportunity
that
chance
gave
herbert
an
adverse
rub
edith
with
captain
mountcharles
as
escort
was
returning
from
the
moorish
castle
when
she
came
suddenly
upon
herbert
larkins
he
was
leaving
a
small
cottage
which
was
evidently
a
quarter
it
was
in
fact
the
home
of
old
sergeant
larkins
and
his
wife
bye
mother
herbert
was
saying
as
the
pair
passed
by
bye
my
boy
come
again
soon
you
are
an
honest
lad
not
to
forget
us
although
come
to
be
so
great
a
and
with
that
the
old
woman
kissed
him
tenderly
on
the
brow
although
they
stood
at
the
cottage
door
almost
in
the
open
street
quarter
is
that
the
asked
of
a
passing
orderly
pointing
back
after
they
had
ridden
a
little
way
on
sir
principal
barrack
sergeant
at
which
mountcharles
looked
hard
at
edith
and
with
a
comical
face
what
do
i
care
what
is
it
to
me
it
is
quite
proper
of
him
it
is
his
duty
not
to
neglect
his
of
course
a
dear
old
thing
too
i
can
see
that
how
would
you
like
her
for
a
edith
prioleau
eh
dare
you
suggest
such
a
thing
captain
mountcharles
cried
edith
blushing
red
but
there
was
a
cold
chill
on
her
heart
and
chances
seemed
very
small
just
then
chapter
viii
herbert
on
his
mettle
herbert
was
all
unconscious
that
he
had
been
observed
leaving
the
cottage
near
the
moorish
castle
still
more
that
he
had
been
overheard
addressing
larkins
as
of
old
by
the
affectionate
title
of
mother
had
he
heard
what
passed
between
edith
and
captain
mountcharles
upon
that
occasion
it
might
have
modified
his
plans
very
considerably
for
now
at
length
after
much
hesitation
and
delay
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
speak
to
edith
on
the
first
opportunity
and
tell
her
of
his
love
matters
had
long
continued
in
this
most
unsatisfactory
state
with
him
he
had
suffered
tortures
he
had
been
continually
in
suspense
for
ever
torn
by
hopes
and
fears
one
day
he
was
in
the
seventh
heaven
the
next
in
the
very
depths
of
despair
he
could
do
no
work
edith
seemed
to
come
between
him
and
his
duty
he
thought
of
her
always
everywhere
he
was
for
ever
sketching
her
face
upon
the
official
blotting
pad
in
the
he
was
all
but
giving
edith
as
the
countersign
when
challenged
by
the
sentries
he
very
nearly
mixed
up
her
name
with
the
words
of
command
upon
parade
latterly
however
he
had
been
in
much
better
heart
she
did
not
encourage
him
perhaps
as
much
as
he
would
have
liked
but
she
favoured
him
more
he
thought
than
any
of
his
fellows
therefore
it
was
that
he
had
brought
himself
up
to
the
terrible
ordeal
of
staking
his
fate
upon
the
throw
and
it
was
with
this
intention
that
he
approached
miss
prioleau
the
very
next
time
they
met
it
was
at
a
ball
at
the
convent
at
the
well
known
palace
or
residence
of
the
governor
of
the
rock
edith
was
seated
upon
a
fauteuil
in
the
or
central
courtyard
between
the
dances
her
companion
was
captain
mountcharles
i
have
the
pleasure
of
a
dance
miss
prioleau
herbert
asked
afraid
i
have
none
promised
me
the
second
valse
quite
a
week
prioleau
is
engaged
for
that
to
me
put
in
captain
mountcharles
rather
rudely
next
then
went
on
herbert
to
edith
without
taking
any
notice
of
the
for
that
too
said
mountcharles
in
much
the
same
tone
as
before
me
i
was
speaking
to
miss
prioleau
and
i
trust
she
will
give
me
the
answer
quite
true
she
was
going
to
say
as
the
easiest
way
out
of
the
thing
but
she
was
far
too
honest
to
tell
a
lie
even
about
a
dance
and
besides
there
was
a
mute
appealing
look
in
face
which
went
to
her
heart
mean
that
you
are
rather
late
in
the
day
she
had
promised
not
to
dance
with
him
that
was
the
fact
there
had
been
a
scene
at
the
about
this
larkins
as
prioleau
called
him
edith
had
been
taken
rather
sharply
to
task
for
encouraging
him
and
both
father
and
mother
had
begged
her
to
be
careful
the
man
half
good
enough
for
her
they
said
they
had
no
absurd
scruples
about
birth
and
position
and
all
that
still
she
ought
to
do
much
better
than
take
a
soldier
of
fortune
about
whom
and
his
belongings
nothing
whatever
was
known
edith
remembering
the
moorish
castle
adventure
thought
she
could
have
enlightened
her
parents
as
to
belongings
but
she
had
no
wish
to
injure
him
or
to
blacken
him
in
their
eyes
she
only
hotly
repudiated
the
charge
of
favouring
him
and
agreed
readily
to
do
anything
they
wished
she
would
cut
him
if
they
liked
not
necessary
well
snub
him
then
not
necessary
either
what
then
general
and
prioleau
declared
they
would
be
satisfied
if
she
would
promise
not
to
dance
with
the
objectionable
pretender
at
the
ball
and
edith
gave
her
word
to
that
effect
this
was
why
she
had
received
herbert
so
coldly
the
other
adventure
had
weighed
perhaps
with
her
but
not
much
as
for
herbert
he
was
utterly
taken
aback
what
could
be
the
matter
with
edith
why
this
extraordinary
change
was
the
girl
capricious
a
mere
flirt
a
garrison
belle
to
whom
admiration
was
everything
and
admirers
or
their
feelings
simply
nothing
at
all
herbert
did
not
like
to
think
so
hardly
of
her
all
at
once
and
resolved
to
make
another
attempt
it
quite
hopeless
miss
prioleau
may
i
not
have
one
dance
only
one
again
he
pleaded
with
such
earnest
eyes
that
edith
prioleau
was
touched
and
on
the
point
of
giving
way
did
you
cut
me
the
other
day
larkins
suddenly
asked
captain
mountcharles
with
the
idea
of
creating
some
diversion
never
cut
although
i
probably
shall
and
the
sooner
the
better
herbert
was
disposed
to
add
and
where
was
it
the
moorish
cottage
you
were
coming
out
of
some
yes
sergeant
perhaps
the
other
observed
impertinently
near
and
very
dear
herbert
replied
promptly
this
was
not
an
occasion
on
which
he
would
deny
his
old
friends
any
rate
you
are
honest
larkins
edith
said
with
a
frank
smile
but
herbert
knew
from
the
speech
that
edith
had
been
also
present
and
he
seemed
to
understand
now
why
she
was
so
different
to
him
is
not
the
exclusive
property
of
high
birth
miss
prioleau
and
i
can
claim
at
least
to
have
as
much
as
my
edith
the
music
is
playing
cried
captain
mountcharles
springing
up
are
losing
half
the
not
going
to
dance
this
she
replied
coolly
adding
as
he
stared
at
her
with
indignant
surprise
care
whether
cross
or
not
go
and
find
some
other
partners
there
are
plenty
upstairs
i
mean
to
stay
here
larkins
will
take
care
of
me
i
a
quick
flush
of
pleasure
sprung
to
cheek
she
was
relenting
she
did
not
mean
to
quarrel
with
him
altogether
perhaps
after
all
she
had
been
only
trying
him
and
was
ready
to
yield
if
he
only
took
heart
of
grace
to
speak
up
and
out
to
her
like
a
man
mountcharles
with
a
sulky
snort
and
a
very
savage
look
had
risen
from
his
seat
and
walked
off
leaving
herbert
considerably
elated
master
of
the
field
our
hero
would
have
been
less
joyous
perhaps
had
he
known
reason
for
thus
appearing
to
favour
him
with
the
native
quick
wittedness
of
a
daughter
of
eve
she
had
guessed
already
what
was
the
matter
with
herbert
a
man
who
seeks
to
disguise
his
feelings
in
the
presence
of
the
woman
he
loves
may
flatter
himself
that
he
plays
his
part
to
perfection
but
it
is
generally
the
flimsiest
attempt
even
to
ordinary
feminine
eyes
most
of
all
to
those
of
the
beloved
object
edith
had
seen
through
him
from
the
first
she
knew
that
he
was
on
the
brink
of
a
declaration
that
he
needed
but
the
slightest
encouragement
to
fall
metaphorically
even
practically
at
her
feet
it
was
better
that
he
and
she
should
come
to
an
understanding
that
he
should
realise
even
at
some
pain
to
himself
as
well
as
to
her
that
they
could
only
be
friends
to
each
other
nothing
more
there
was
a
certain
amount
of
coquetry
in
her
fresh
young
voice
and
of
archness
in
her
bright
eyes
as
she
looked
up
to
him
and
said
larkins
he
had
been
standing
in
front
of
her
for
some
minutes
seeming
rather
and
stupid
and
without
uttering
a
word
courage
seemed
to
come
to
him
at
once
from
her
voice
and
look
was
wondering
whether
you
would
listen
to
me
miss
prioleau
while
i
told
you
a
story
a
long
story
depends
is
it
interesting
is
it
founded
on
fact
what
is
it
about
will
be
as
interesting
as
i
can
make
it
it
is
undoubtedly
true
and
it
is
all
about
own
history
so
far
as
i
know
she
made
no
answer
but
just
moved
her
skirts
a
little
with
the
gesture
that
implied
she
wished
him
to
sit
by
her
side
there
were
other
couples
in
the
patrolling
or
resting
between
the
dances
there
might
be
many
interruptions
there
certainly
could
be
no
privacy
in
this
place
and
herbert
did
not
wish
his
confidences
published
to
all
the
world
we
take
a
turn
in
the
garden
herbert
asked
rather
diffidently
shall
be
able
to
speak
more
unreservedly
she
nodded
her
head
and
getting
up
took
his
arm
without
a
word
they
passed
out
from
the
to
the
convent
garden
a
perfect
paradise
that
night
for
lovers
the
moon
was
at
its
full
a
southern
moon
and
flooded
every
place
with
warm
white
light
above
was
the
deep
purple
sky
and
high
into
it
rose
the
steep
crags
of
the
great
rock
the
soft
and
mellow
air
was
loaded
with
fragrance
a
wealth
of
southern
flowers
all
now
in
their
full
bloom
filled
the
beds
about
and
among
them
were
great
bushes
like
trees
of
syringa
and
of
the
de
which
only
give
forth
their
full
perfume
at
night
the
sweet
strains
of
an
excellent
band
playing
for
the
dancers
in
the
great
rose
and
fell
like
a
distant
echo
and
added
greatly
to
the
enchantment
of
the
scene
walking
here
with
the
girl
of
his
heart
herbert
spoke
eloquently
and
well
he
told
everything
that
had
happened
to
him
from
his
earliest
days
the
poor
home
in
triggertown
barracks
the
sudden
appearance
of
the
great
lady
who
had
charged
herself
with
his
education
the
fine
prospects
which
seemed
to
open
before
him
on
approaching
manhood
and
how
they
had
been
suddenly
ruined
he
spoke
feelingly
of
the
treatment
he
had
received
at
the
hands
of
sir
rupert
farrington
you
so
nobly
repaid
interjected
edith
he
narrated
the
circumstances
of
his
birth
and
parentage
and
expatiated
upon
the
affectionate
devotion
of
old
larkins
who
had
been
a
second
mother
to
him
he
touched
lightly
upon
the
chances
which
were
still
his
of
obtaining
a
title
to
a
large
estate
and
a
good
old
name
he
finished
and
waited
to
hear
what
she
would
say
but
she
was
silent
and
for
so
long
that
he
feared
she
was
annoyed
are
not
vexed
i
have
not
bored
you
i
hope
he
said
no
no
i
was
only
thinking
thinking
how
hardly
you
had
been
used
how
some
of
us
too
had
misjudged
she
spoke
in
a
low
soft
voice
which
thrilled
through
him
were
not
one
of
those
surely
you
whose
good
opinion
i
value
above
all
earthly
things
oh
miss
prioleau
there
is
so
much
i
have
still
to
say
to
you
that
i
hardly
know
how
to
begin
can
you
not
guess
why
i
have
told
you
my
life
i
wished
only
to
interest
you
in
myself
to
explain
why
as
yet
i
appear
to
be
other
than
i
really
am
i
felt
it
necessary
because
i
feared
you
despised
me
for
my
lowly
birth
no
indeed
i
never
did
knew
it
i
knew
it
but
i
wished
to
be
perfectly
sure
you
are
too
good
edith
too
honest
to
be
swayed
by
mere
class
distinctions
he
was
suddenly
and
rather
rudely
interrupted
by
the
abrupt
tones
of
general
voice
i
am
not
larkins
and
the
sooner
you
know
that
the
better
you
probably
despise
them
as
you
do
those
conventional
rules
of
propriety
by
which
any
one
of
the
gentleman
class
would
be
the
general
spoke
with
great
warmth
there
was
no
abatement
in
the
angriness
of
his
tone
as
he
turned
to
his
daughter
and
said
your
mother
and
i
have
been
looking
for
you
for
some
time
past
i
hardly
thought
to
find
you
here
and
to
see
that
you
have
not
kept
your
gave
no
promise
i
never
said
i
would
not
speak
to
larkins
again
edith
said
stoutly
although
her
eyes
were
brimming
over
with
tears
give
edith
your
arm
and
take
her
back
to
her
mother
i
have
a
word
or
two
to
say
to
this
herbert
however
had
by
this
time
found
his
voice
he
was
brave
enough
too
and
spoke
up
to
the
general
in
spite
of
their
disparity
in
rank
as
one
man
would
to
another
am
truly
sorry
sir
to
have
acted
in
a
manner
which
is
distasteful
to
you
but
i
can
not
admit
that
i
deserve
your
harsh
words
i
have
done
nothing
wrong
sir
wrong
repeated
the
general
bitterly
in
seeking
to
entrap
the
affections
of
an
inexperienced
young
girl
nothing
wrong
in
inveigling
her
to
compromise
herself
with
you
by
this
long
and
solitary
nothing
wrong
am
deeply
and
sincerely
attached
to
your
daughter
sir
and
i
wished
to
ask
her
to
become
my
there
ever
such
matchless
effrontery
to
aspire
to
my
hand
what
position
could
you
give
her
what
would
you
live
upon
am
not
utterly
penniless
i
have
good
expectations
i
have
hopes
indeed
of
succeeding
to
a
title
of
i
presume
but
this
is
sheer
waste
of
time
i
know
all
about
you
all
i
wish
to
hear
and
i
want
nothing
further
our
acquaintance
must
cease
i
forbid
you
to
enter
my
house
or
ever
again
to
address
my
daughter
i
decline
distinctly
to
hold
any
further
communications
with
you
if
your
own
good
taste
does
not
prompt
you
to
accede
to
my
wishes
i
must
try
to
protect
myself
and
my
family
by
other
will
win
her
in
spite
of
you
general
said
herbert
firmly
and
very
coolly
although
his
blood
was
up
is
due
to
myself
to
say
that
neither
by
word
or
deed
have
i
knowingly
sought
to
entangle
miss
prioleau
in
any
engagement
she
is
under
no
promise
to
me
i
am
not
certain
whether
she
cares
for
me
even
as
a
friend
but
if
god
but
grants
me
strength
and
health
to
fight
my
way
she
shall
one
day
be
my
wife
and
that
in
spite
of
you
and
he
walked
away
leaving
general
prioleau
aghast
at
his
impudence
chapter
ix
on
the
trail
general
prioleau
was
not
the
pleasantest
company
the
morning
after
the
convent
ball
although
commonly
counted
an
man
whom
nothing
seriously
ruffled
for
long
he
was
this
day
evidently
in
the
vilest
of
tempers
no
one
liked
to
face
him
his
wife
was
well
aware
of
the
cause
of
his
anger
and
in
her
own
lymphatic
way
approved
it
but
the
general
had
given
her
a
very
bad
quarter
of
an
hour
over
the
whole
affair
and
had
openly
told
her
that
if
she
had
shown
a
little
more
energy
and
had
kept
a
more
vigilant
eye
upon
her
daughter
any
such
as
this
could
not
have
occurred
edith
was
of
course
in
utter
disgrace
her
father
scowled
at
her
at
breakfast
as
though
he
thought
her
guilty
of
the
most
heinous
offence
and
should
be
immediately
brought
to
trial
when
the
came
in
he
was
taken
to
task
for
various
acts
of
omission
and
commission
while
the
other
members
of
the
staff
who
brought
him
documents
to
discuss
and
papers
to
sign
found
him
utterly
impracticable
and
impossible
what
chafed
him
most
probably
was
that
the
chief
offender
was
practically
beyond
the
reach
of
his
rage
a
general
is
a
great
man
within
the
limits
of
his
own
command
but
his
powers
are
professional
merely
and
scarcely
extend
to
life
and
limb
general
prioleau
was
really
able
to
inflict
upon
herbert
no
stronger
mark
of
his
displeasure
than
to
cut
him
and
snub
him
and
refuse
to
grant
him
leave
he
might
report
unfavourably
upon
him
in
the
next
confidential
returns
but
only
by
subordinating
his
sense
of
duty
to
personal
pique
a
line
of
conduct
abhorrent
to
an
officer
and
an
english
gentleman
such
as
general
prioleau
undoubtedly
was
what
would
have
pleased
him
best
would
have
been
to
order
herbert
at
once
to
leave
the
rock
could
not
colonel
greathed
be
persuaded
to
send
this
pestilent
young
fellow
to
the
depot
and
keep
him
out
of
the
way
then
the
general
remembered
that
larkins
was
adjutant
and
a
right
good
adjutant
and
that
he
could
not
be
transferred
to
the
depot
unless
he
voluntarily
resigned
the
appointment
which
he
was
little
likely
to
do
is
only
one
way
out
of
it
he
said
at
last
to
his
wife
must
send
edith
away
she
shall
go
to
england
to
her
aunts
by
the
very
next
will
be
the
chief
sufferer
by
that
you
know
you
can
not
bear
to
part
with
the
girl
even
for
an
hour
but
for
that
she
would
have
gone
to
school
i
always
wished
it
if
she
had
perhaps
always
wish
things
when
too
late
to
get
them
replied
the
general
testily
she
shall
go
now
i
am
angry
with
her
and
can
spare
all
arrangements
were
laid
accordingly
and
edith
was
duly
prepared
for
her
journey
home
she
did
not
quite
object
to
go
away
but
she
consented
with
a
very
bad
grace
if
this
did
not
tend
to
mollify
the
general
he
was
presently
made
far
more
angry
by
what
appeared
to
be
the
most
audacious
pertinacity
on
the
part
of
her
lover
just
within
a
day
or
two
of
departure
herbert
larkins
also
applied
for
leave
of
absence
to
proceed
to
england
on
very
urgent
private
affairs
the
application
had
come
before
the
general
in
the
usual
way
presented
to
him
as
a
matter
of
course
with
a
number
of
other
documents
the
most
exasperating
piece
of
presumption
i
ever
heard
of
in
all
my
life
he
shall
not
have
it
not
an
hour
commanding
officer
recommends
it
sir
a
substitute
is
named
i
really
think
said
the
expostulating
it
is
so
unusual
a
thing
for
a
general
officer
to
refuse
leave
which
is
properly
backed
up
and
all
according
to
form
do
i
care
about
the
colonel
does
he
command
the
brigade
or
do
i
of
course
it
rests
with
you
sir
still
to
refuse
it
peremptorily
and
without
apparent
reasons
reasons
man
you
know
that
the
general
stopped
short
his
probably
did
not
know
the
family
trouble
nor
was
there
reason
why
he
should
up
for
colonel
greathed
to
come
and
see
me
as
soon
as
possible
the
general
said
abruptly
will
speak
to
him
personally
on
the
the
general
had
cooled
down
a
little
by
the
time
colonel
greathed
arrived
he
was
quite
cautious
and
diplomatic
too
speaking
first
of
certain
routine
matters
before
he
approached
the
matter
he
had
really
at
heart
see
your
adjutant
is
asking
for
leave
are
you
sure
you
can
spare
him
i
think
so
quite
like
it
colonel
i
have
really
some
hesitation
about
granting
this
leave
i
should
be
loth
to
find
fault
but
your
men
are
at
their
spring
drills
they
want
plenty
of
they
stand
to
their
arms
quite
as
i
should
like
altogether
not
finding
fault
remember
nothing
is
further
from
my
mind
still
the
eye
is
wanted
just
now
and
i
feel
that
it
ought
to
be
is
most
anxious
to
go
sir
private
affairs
of
some
urgency
require
his
personal
rose
from
the
ranks
i
believe
what
private
affairs
could
he
possibly
have
you
are
not
aware
general
of
history
that
he
is
the
adopted
son
of
an
old
lady
of
rank
there
is
no
truth
in
that
story
me
sir
it
is
perfectly
true
i
have
the
pleasure
of
knowing
the
old
lady
lady
farrington
diggle
you
may
remember
married
a
farrington
but
of
another
this
larkins
has
no
claim
i
suppose
to
the
name
nothing
more
than
a
claim
i
mean
am
not
so
sure
it
may
be
difficult
to
prove
his
case
but
he
has
a
case
and
a
good
one
at
any
rate
the
old
lady
is
devotedly
attached
to
him
and
likes
to
see
him
now
and
again
she
has
now
written
pressing
him
most
earnestly
to
pay
her
a
visit
thinking
i
believe
that
something
of
importance
is
likely
to
turn
this
why
he
asks
leave
has
he
no
other
reasons
that
i
am
aware
of
except
that
he
thinks
of
competing
at
the
next
staff
college
final
examination
and
wishes
to
see
what
it
is
like
so
as
to
prepare
in
good
the
general
could
not
well
withhold
his
consent
any
longer
but
he
was
resolved
now
to
keep
edith
by
his
side
there
was
of
course
no
reason
why
she
should
leave
the
rock
on
the
contrary
the
chances
of
meeting
larkins
on
board
the
steamer
or
in
england
must
be
as
far
as
possible
avoided
the
man
was
a
forward
fellow
as
reckless
as
he
was
presuming
who
it
was
quite
likely
would
make
opportunities
for
prosecuting
his
suit
general
prioleau
was
little
less
bitter
against
herbert
in
spite
of
what
greathed
had
told
him
he
could
not
possibly
bring
himself
to
think
of
our
hero
as
otherwise
than
an
ineligible
and
unsatisfactory
herbert
himself
was
also
greatly
excited
by
what
had
occurred
he
had
only
seen
edith
twice
since
the
ball
she
was
riding
on
the
beach
closely
guarded
the
general
on
one
side
his
on
the
other
herbert
had
raised
his
hat
as
in
duty
bound
to
his
official
superior
who
returned
the
salute
formally
captain
mountcharles
looked
straight
to
his
front
and
edith
bowed
gravely
and
sadly
he
thought
in
the
short
glimpse
he
caught
of
her
face
it
was
war
of
course
to
the
knife
the
animosity
was
all
the
more
plainly
shown
by
his
attitude
about
the
leave
for
colonel
greathed
had
given
herbert
an
outline
of
his
interview
with
the
chief
have
a
very
shrewd
notion
what
is
wrong
with
him
greathed
said
want
you
to
tell
me
more
than
you
choose
larkins
but
i
have
eyes
and
ears
and
i
know
pretty
well
what
has
been
going
is
no
secret
in
the
matter
sir
and
herbert
told
his
colonel
exactly
what
had
happened
at
the
ball
are
evidently
in
earnest
larkins
and
i
wish
you
luck
said
greathed
laughing
not
surprised
the
general
was
a
little
put
out
and
now
what
do
you
mean
to
do
to
it
to
the
last
sir
if
i
could
be
only
sure
that
she
would
wait
but
in
a
place
like
this
and
with
a
man
like
mountcharles
always
close
by
i
be
in
the
least
afraid
but
for
a
long
lane
that
has
no
turning
you
must
make
your
way
in
the
service
get
upon
the
staff
lose
no
opportunity
of
employment
everything
comes
to
the
man
who
is
determined
to
win
perhaps
that
other
affair
may
turn
up
trumps
lady
farrington
you
say
thinks
that
some
important
evidence
will
soon
be
forthcoming
dear
old
lady
is
always
thinking
that
sir
said
herbert
with
a
smile
a
little
like
the
boy
that
cried
wolf
there
have
been
so
many
false
alarms
that
i
believe
the
real
thing
if
it
ever
comes
to
you
any
idea
what
she
is
expecting
now
in
the
least
she
gives
me
only
the
vaguest
hints
i
half
fancy
it
is
only
an
affectionate
ruse
to
get
me
back
to
england
for
a
but
it
was
something
more
than
that
as
the
reader
will
now
see
some
eleven
months
had
elapsed
since
the
last
advertisement
had
been
published
offering
a
large
reward
for
information
concerning
the
marriage
of
herbert
farrington
and
annie
orde
but
no
satisfactory
answer
had
been
received
hope
was
already
failing
all
but
the
sanguine
old
lady
farrington
who
kept
on
declaring
persistently
that
the
right
would
certainly
prosper
in
the
end
as
she
was
the
only
person
who
stoutly
maintained
that
proofs
of
the
marriage
must
certainly
be
forthcoming
so
she
was
the
only
one
who
was
not
surprised
when
one
morning
a
mysterious
letter
arrived
from
no
one
knew
where
and
sent
by
no
one
knew
whom
it
was
addressed
to
bellhouse
who
had
long
been
the
solicitor
as
well
as
lady
and
consisted
of
only
a
few
lines
scribbled
on
the
back
of
an
old
invoice
for
goods
who
seek
find
search
the
registers
of
the
parish
of
in
the
county
of
he
who
was
once
herbert
farrington
sends
a
communication
which
drove
lady
farrington
nearly
frantic
it
revived
and
indeed
supported
all
her
old
fancies
that
her
injured
son
was
still
alive
she
declared
that
she
recognised
his
handwriting
she
began
once
more
although
a
long
interval
had
elapsed
to
hear
his
voice
and
to
see
his
beloved
form
in
her
dreams
she
talked
incessantly
about
him
and
his
probable
return
had
she
not
been
carefully
tended
and
watched
by
her
own
servants
she
might
have
had
a
very
serious
relapse
chapter
x
a
letter
farrington
hall
was
an
excellent
specimen
of
our
sixteenth
century
domestic
architecture
it
was
a
long
low
building
with
white
stone
mullions
and
it
stood
on
a
gentle
eminence
which
dominated
the
fat
lands
of
the
farrington
estate
it
had
all
the
conventional
surroundings
which
confer
dignity
on
an
old
place
magnificent
trees
in
which
lived
a
prosperous
colony
of
rooks
a
great
park
of
velvety
grass
a
broad
slow
stream
at
the
foot
of
the
slope
on
which
stood
the
hall
there
had
been
farringtons
of
farrington
from
time
immemorial
the
transmission
of
the
title
and
estates
had
long
been
direct
from
father
to
son
only
at
rare
intervals
as
in
the
case
of
the
present
baronet
sir
rupert
did
distant
relatives
succeed
but
now
at
last
the
race
was
nearly
run
there
were
no
males
left
not
even
a
cousin
twenty
times
removed
and
after
sir
death
the
title
would
be
extinct
there
was
an
heir
for
the
property
certainly
but
only
through
the
female
branch
letitia
diggle
would
come
into
everything
of
course
and
after
her
her
children
but
although
her
eldest
boy
under
sir
will
would
probably
assume
the
farrington
name
and
arms
the
baronetcy
could
not
be
his
and
in
consequence
diggle
was
very
much
aggrieved
the
had
by
this
time
taken
up
their
residence
at
the
hall
they
came
in
the
first
instance
by
invitation
but
remained
afterwards
as
a
matter
of
course
the
old
people
liked
to
hear
the
patter
of
their
feet
and
their
merry
shrill
trebles
as
they
played
about
the
place
this
had
to
some
extent
dispelled
the
fixed
gloom
which
had
settled
on
lady
farrington
after
her
death
even
black
sir
rupert
was
softened
and
seemed
to
take
a
pleasure
in
their
prattle
and
merry
ways
but
then
letitia
had
always
been
an
especial
favourite
of
his
her
cast
of
character
was
in
harmony
with
his
she
reproduced
many
of
his
own
peculiar
traits
she
was
as
unforgiving
as
determined
and
as
hard
she
showed
pretty
plainly
what
she
would
be
if
she
lived
to
inherit
the
estates
and
already
exercised
a
kind
of
authority
such
as
often
usurp
when
allowed
she
knew
the
estate
by
heart
every
inch
every
tenant
she
had
her
own
views
as
to
the
rentals
and
the
outgoings
she
kept
a
sharp
on
the
bailiff
and
gave
him
to
understand
that
she
was
up
to
every
move
sir
rupert
to
a
great
extent
let
her
have
her
own
way
it
pleased
him
to
think
that
the
property
would
fall
into
good
hands
and
ideas
were
so
much
in
accord
with
his
own
that
they
seldom
fell
out
or
disagreed
it
was
amusing
to
see
how
the
great
diggle
comported
himself
at
farrington
hall
he
was
a
curious
example
of
how
low
the
once
mighty
may
fall
from
having
been
a
tremendous
personage
he
had
sunk
to
the
position
of
a
mere
he
was
not
even
prince
consort
to
a
reigning
queen
his
wife
looked
upon
him
as
an
appendage
a
person
useful
in
his
way
but
not
entitled
to
have
any
voice
in
the
management
of
affairs
or
indeed
any
opinions
of
his
own
he
might
have
resented
this
and
refused
the
rather
ignominious
but
for
two
reasons
the
first
was
that
his
health
was
very
indifferent
and
he
had
no
spirit
to
battle
for
his
rights
the
second
that
diggle
had
made
certain
discoveries
as
to
his
family
and
antecedents
which
left
him
very
much
in
her
power
the
fact
was
that
cavendish
really
belonged
to
the
great
tea
firm
trading
and
largely
advertising
under
the
name
of
diggle
and
what
was
more
the
firm
was
in
a
very
bad
way
to
have
married
a
diggle
at
all
was
in
itself
a
condescension
but
to
have
become
the
wife
of
a
pauper
diggle
was
something
like
a
there
had
been
settlements
of
course
but
not
to
a
large
amount
as
diggle
declared
he
had
but
little
ready
cash
although
his
prospects
were
excellent
moreover
his
hopes
undoubtedly
at
the
time
of
professional
advancement
which
had
been
not
the
least
potent
inducement
to
the
match
were
now
fading
into
nothingness
and
there
seemed
every
reason
to
fear
that
owing
to
his
wretched
health
colonel
diggle
would
continue
a
officer
for
the
rest
of
his
life
a
who
is
poor
and
without
any
chances
of
obtaining
social
distinction
has
no
at
all
and
diggle
was
fast
degenerating
into
a
mere
cipher
a
poor
creature
who
had
no
other
claims
to
respect
but
that
of
being
father
to
the
who
would
some
day
be
the
master
of
farrington
hall
they
were
at
breakfast
at
farrington
hall
one
morning
when
the
arrived
and
as
usual
was
opened
at
the
table
the
letters
were
served
out
like
alms
grudgingly
given
by
sir
rupert
to
each
but
he
still
kept
the
share
to
himself
all
were
soon
deep
in
their
correspondence
lady
were
gossipy
letters
filling
several
sheets
the
same
with
a
large
sprinkling
of
circulars
and
bills
the
colonel
heard
only
from
old
soldier
friends
short
but
often
pithy
notes
having
mostly
the
same
refrain
the
grievances
or
his
forcibly
expressed
conviction
that
the
service
was
going
to
the
dogs
these
last
were
the
soonest
read
and
diggle
was
therefore
the
only
one
free
to
notice
what
passed
among
the
others
at
table
it
was
quite
clear
that
sir
rupert
was
very
much
put
out
by
his
news
although
little
given
to
betray
what
was
passing
in
his
mind
his
demeanour
after
he
had
opened
and
read
the
first
few
lines
of
one
of
his
letters
was
that
of
a
man
in
whom
indignation
excitement
and
rage
combined
to
considerably
disturb
his
black
eyebrows
contracted
his
hard
mouth
was
drawn
down
at
the
corners
he
looked
up
and
around
with
fierce
bloodshot
eyes
and
as
quickly
looked
down
again
when
he
saw
that
he
was
observed
by
diggle
after
that
he
a
pull
on
himself
so
to
speak
and
folding
up
the
evidently
offensive
missive
put
it
with
the
others
then
lapsed
into
moody
preoccupied
silence
until
the
breakfast
was
over
should
like
to
speak
to
you
letitia
in
the
justice
room
as
soon
as
you
conveniently
can
he
often
consulted
her
and
there
was
nothing
strange
therefore
in
this
request
except
in
the
abrupt
and
peremptory
tone
in
which
it
was
made
the
justice
room
in
which
sir
rupert
gave
audience
to
constables
and
administered
the
law
when
urgently
required
was
also
his
library
study
and
place
of
business
it
was
a
cheerless
formal
room
which
took
as
rooms
usually
do
the
colour
and
temper
of
its
occupant
and
was
like
him
cold
and
uncompromising
sir
rupert
seated
himself
at
his
official
table
in
his
high
magisterial
chair
and
sorting
his
letters
carefully
selected
that
which
had
so
evidently
disturbed
him
read
and
it
several
times
then
letitia
joined
him
father
down
please
what
i
have
to
say
will
take
some
he
paused
letter
has
reached
me
this
morning
from
lady
the
lawyer
it
may
be
all
a
hoax
let
us
hope
that
it
is
but
i
confess
i
am
greatly
disturbed
by
what
it
letitia
looked
at
him
keenly
interrogative
but
said
nothing
remember
no
doubt
the
circumstances
of
the
old
craze
it
was
no
secret
in
the
family
she
pretended
that
a
grandchild
of
hers
was
in
existence
who
was
the
rightful
heir
to
the
title
and
estates
all
that
you
knew
of
course
had
heard
the
absurd
story
idiotic
old
woman
i
can
not
understand
why
you
ever
let
her
out
said
letitia
as
though
her
father
had
full
powers
to
commit
to
durance
indefinite
every
individual
likely
to
injure
the
farrington
family
or
whose
brain
was
touched
the
two
being
synonymous
terms
did
not
wish
to
let
her
out
i
assure
you
it
was
done
in
spite
of
me
and
by
the
person
who
is
i
believe
at
the
bottom
of
the
newest
attempt
to
defraud
us
of
our
they
threatened
by
whom
letitia
was
like
a
lioness
who
with
her
whelps
was
about
to
be
robbed
of
her
prey
old
lady
you
must
know
did
not
fabricate
her
story
without
something
to
go
upon
there
was
some
semblance
of
probability
she
produced
the
rightful
heir
not
quite
at
the
right
time
perhaps
but
there
he
you
meet
him
did
so
did
you
you
knew
him
father
preposterous
where
pray
did
we
meet
served
as
a
private
in
the
own
his
name
the
name
he
went
by
at
least
was
the
sergeant
poor
champion
never
larkins
whom
i
received
here
at
your
express
desire
whom
i
treated
with
the
utmost
consideration
proved
a
snake
in
the
grass
he
first
thwarted
me
with
regard
to
old
lady
release
from
confinement
then
with
her
concocted
a
scheme
of
which
i
have
only
learnt
the
real
intent
this
letter
from
the
lawyers
is
nothing
more
or
less
than
a
notice
to
quit
a
regular
notice
of
ejectment
in
favour
of
herbert
farrington
son
of
herbert
of
the
same
name
and
grandson
of
the
last
a
swindle
of
course
from
beginning
to
end
a
story
you
submit
father
i
trust
to
such
a
barefaced
imposition
letitia
was
in
arms
at
once
for
the
threatened
action
struck
at
her
more
perhaps
than
any
one
else
shall
defend
myself
and
you
you
may
depend
upon
it
i
shall
not
submit
tamely
to
any
attempt
at
extortion
it
is
really
life
and
death
to
it
not
the
same
to
me
and
to
my
children
to
my
rupert
who
some
day
will
be
your
heir
are
we
to
be
robbed
with
impunity
certainly
have
not
told
me
much
of
their
case
of
course
a
mere
outline
nothing
more
but
it
is
evidently
a
strong
one
they
have
discovered
so
they
say
old
herbert
marriage
if
a
discovery
we
are
bound
to
accept
it
after
due
verification
at
do
they
pretend
the
real
herbert
farrington
when
serving
in
the
lancers
as
corporal
smith
married
ann
orde
and
had
larkins
sergeant
larkins
of
the
own
never
believe
it
not
if
i
live
to
a
hundred
but
father
what
do
you
mean
to
do
you
will
resist
surely
for
my
sake
for
that
of
my
children
you
will
not
give
in
we
could
effect
a
compromise
cried
letitia
with
my
consent
i
protest
against
any
compromise
at
might
be
was
it
possible
that
sir
rupert
had
reasons
for
dreading
a
no
one
knew
more
about
the
case
than
himself
was
he
in
possession
of
any
information
damaging
facts
which
he
had
so
far
kept
secret
but
which
would
be
certain
to
come
out
on
a
trial
a
long
it
would
eat
up
the
whole
estate
no
doubt
this
pretender
this
larkins
would
gladly
come
to
terms
a
few
thousands
paid
on
the
nail
would
silence
him
for
father
dream
of
making
such
concessions
letitia
almost
shrieked
the
idea
of
parting
thus
coolly
with
thousands
out
of
the
future
heritage
of
her
children
no
better
to
fight
it
out
to
resist
to
the
bitter
think
i
must
consult
your
mother
and
have
they
to
say
to
it
i
am
the
person
principally
concerned
i
and
mine
we
shall
be
the
greatest
said
her
father
very
gravely
to
her
was
not
only
to
speak
to
you
concerning
this
letter
that
i
asked
you
to
come
here
it
was
to
break
some
worse
us
all
but
more
particularly
on
quick
very
lately
i
had
thought
that
after
me
there
would
be
an
end
of
the
farringtons
you
would
be
sole
heiress
to
the
estates
to
which
your
children
would
succeed
but
the
title
would
become
extinct
and
the
name
unless
specially
assumed
within
the
last
month
or
two
i
have
discovered
that
i
have
a
lawful
male
heir
who
must
inevitably
come
between
you
in
the
entail
ernest
poor
ernest
left
a
that
person
that
woman
father
how
dare
you
mention
her
name
in
my
presence
what
claims
can
such
a
creature
as
her
offspring
have
upon
you
ernest
married
her
letitia
there
is
not
a
shadow
of
a
doubt
of
it
the
whole
of
the
proofs
are
in
my
possession
the
child
i
have
not
seen
and
will
not
see
but
your
mother
has
indeed
the
whole
thing
has
come
out
through
was
always
her
favourite
said
letitia
bitterly
it
was
being
borne
into
her
gradually
how
much
she
was
about
to
lose
i
shall
not
surrender
my
rights
except
upon
compulsion
father
we
have
lawyers
too
you
must
remember
and
where
a
large
property
is
at
stake
people
must
look
out
for
wish
for
your
sake
the
case
was
not
so
am
not
at
all
satisfied
as
yet
father
there
will
be
two
perhaps
and
i
shall
not
accept
any
compromise
you
may
there
was
now
a
prospect
of
much
discord
in
the
family
at
farrington
hall
chapter
xi
taking
action
there
were
great
rejoicings
in
upon
return
the
house
was
it
was
lighted
up
as
for
a
grand
entertainment
when
the
door
was
opened
men
in
smart
livery
were
seen
ranged
within
the
hall
hanlon
came
out
first
and
received
herbert
as
he
descended
from
his
cab
he
would
have
carried
his
old
comrade
and
master
in
bodily
on
his
shoulders
but
as
herbert
objected
contented
himself
with
the
portmanteaus
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
miss
ponting
with
new
ribbons
in
her
cap
met
the
traveller
with
a
speech
of
welcome
and
led
him
to
the
where
the
dowager
awaited
him
she
was
dressed
magnificently
in
dark
velvet
and
costly
lace
amidst
which
gleamed
many
diamonds
of
the
finest
water
this
was
all
in
honour
and
of
the
great
occasion
sir
herbert
farrington
all
hail
cried
the
old
lady
using
the
language
but
having
little
of
the
appearance
of
a
witch
in
dearest
grandmother
herbert
said
am
so
glad
to
see
you
again
and
looking
so
well
why
you
are
like
a
queen
am
a
queen
dowager
receiving
the
young
king
she
replied
as
she
made
him
sit
by
her
side
me
look
at
you
well
my
sweet
boy
you
are
my
own
son
i
knew
it
i
felt
it
all
along
and
now
there
is
no
longer
any
doubt
and
you
will
soon
come
into
your
dear
grandmother
be
more
explicit
is
there
anything
new
you
threw
out
vague
hints
in
your
last
letter
but
i
am
still
quite
in
the
will
soon
be
let
in
on
you
my
sweet
boy
at
last
after
all
this
dreary
waiting
and
long
suspense
information
has
reached
bellhouse
from
the
other
side
of
the
grave
i
believe
herbert
looked
keenly
at
the
dowager
was
her
mind
again
becoming
unhinged
can
not
account
for
it
otherwise
the
letter
was
from
my
herbert
my
herbert
of
that
i
have
no
doubt
and
is
he
not
dead
dead
these
many
many
years
bellhouse
laughed
at
it
sneered
at
it
and
the
information
it
gave
yet
he
was
wrong
his
prejudices
misled
him
he
could
not
deny
that
there
was
something
in
it
all
when
we
found
that
it
put
us
on
the
right
track
now
we
have
the
only
evidence
that
was
wanting
to
complete
the
evidence
of
the
marriage
surely
can
it
be
possible
that
you
have
discovered
that
evidence
of
the
and
she
told
him
the
whole
story
as
it
has
been
given
in
a
previous
chapter
you
understand
herbert
why
i
give
you
your
title
it
is
yours
clearly
by
right
you
must
assume
it
at
quite
yet
i
think
herbert
replied
gently
fearing
his
refusal
might
vex
her
would
still
rather
wait
it
would
look
so
foolish
to
have
to
go
back
again
suppose
we
do
not
gain
our
we
must
and
shall
win
it
of
that
i
have
not
the
shadow
of
a
trust
in
heaven
we
shall
herbert
said
in
a
voice
so
earnest
and
yet
so
sad
that
his
good
old
friend
with
a
unerring
intuition
guessed
that
he
was
suffering
and
sore
at
heart
has
happened
to
grieve
you
herbert
dear
you
have
been
you
are
unhappy
tell
me
at
once
every
herbert
was
willing
enough
young
men
crossed
in
love
generally
ask
for
nothing
better
than
an
appreciative
and
consolatory
listener
love
her
truly
deeply
with
all
your
heart
and
soul
said
the
dowager
when
she
had
heard
all
about
edith
prioleau
from
beginning
to
end
i
do
and
have
done
so
ever
since
i
saw
her
you
think
she
returns
it
can
not
be
quite
positive
of
course
but
i
should
be
hopeful
were
i
certain
i
did
not
lose
ground
but
when
one
is
miles
away
and
there
are
so
many
others
close
by
her
encouraged
and
approved
of
by
her
parents
and
with
ever
so
many
opportunities
i
begin
to
be
she
may
give
way
she
may
change
her
mind
there
is
an
old
spanish
proverb
dead
and
those
gone
away
have
no
she
will
soon
forget
me
perhaps
she
may
have
done
so
and
nonsense
cried
the
old
lady
with
great
spirit
you
know
the
rest
is
a
better
proverb
than
that
win
her
of
course
you
shall
win
her
as
you
will
the
the
title
estates
and
everything
does
bellhouse
say
is
he
sanguine
know
what
lawyers
are
and
from
this
herbert
gathered
that
doubts
and
difficulties
still
stood
in
the
way
notwithstanding
lady
confident
hopefulness
bellhouse
is
very
tiresome
at
times
he
is
a
very
man
almost
too
slow
and
cautious
for
me
it
was
only
at
my
most
earnest
entreaty
that
he
would
take
any
action
at
have
commenced
the
suit
then
and
given
sir
rupert
notice
to
quit
said
the
dowager
rubbing
her
hands
in
high
glee
he
replied
came
here
in
person
but
i
would
not
see
him
then
he
went
to
bellhouse
who
declined
to
discuss
the
matter
with
him
the
last
thing
was
a
letter
from
him
imputing
the
basest
motives
to
all
of
us
threatening
a
for
conspiracy
or
something
and
where
it
stands
now
but
with
help
we
shall
beat
him
dear
we
shall
beat
him
and
he
will
wish
that
he
had
given
next
day
herbert
paid
an
early
visit
to
bellhouse
in
inn
fields
and
found
the
old
lawyer
although
in
manner
cordial
and
kind
somewhat
disheartening
in
tone
not
expect
too
much
shall
i
still
say
larkins
yes
i
agree
with
you
it
is
so
much
better
not
to
be
premature
do
not
be
larkins
i
beg
of
you
the
disappointment
would
be
so
bitter
if
we
failed
after
is
quite
on
the
cards
i
presume
herbert
asked
coolly
enough
yes
there
are
flaws
not
many
but
one
or
two
serious
ones
in
the
chain
of
evidence
i
have
no
moral
doubt
myself
that
the
marriage
we
have
discovered
is
truly
that
of
your
father
and
mother
but
moral
proofs
are
not
enough
in
a
court
of
justice
our
difficulty
will
be
to
establish
identity
between
this
corporal
william
smith
and
the
missing
herbert
larkins
will
swear
to
never
knew
him
as
farrington
all
she
can
do
is
to
describe
the
person
she
knew
as
smith
who
ran
off
with
her
sister
and
we
must
compare
her
description
with
that
of
lady
there
was
the
letter
addressed
and
sent
to
lady
farrington
after
my
death
surely
that
will
go
some
way
is
a
strong
presumption
i
deny
but
not
necessarily
sufficient
at
least
to
a
british
jury
when
titles
and
large
possessions
are
at
stake
that
was
why
i
counselled
it
rejected
threats
moreover
were
used
as
perhaps
you
have
was
at
the
bottom
of
that
i
suppose
she
as
heir
apparent
would
be
a
principal
loser
supposing
things
remained
as
they
you
not
aware
of
the
change
in
her
prospects
there
is
a
lawful
male
heir
independent
of
you
i
hear
ernest
farrington
left
a
son
by
mimie
he
married
her
then
thank
heaven
for
that
if
indeed
it
be
can
be
no
question
about
it
ernest
farrington
is
accepted
by
the
family
and
the
child
ernest
is
mentioned
by
sir
rupert
as
a
party
to
the
forthcoming
wonder
whether
the
old
people
the
are
aware
of
this
it
will
gladden
their
hearts
i
almost
wish
that
we
were
going
no
further
with
the
case
they
have
been
such
staunch
friends
to
me
always
that
i
should
be
loth
to
oust
their
is
pure
sentimentalism
said
the
lawyer
must
be
a
limit
to
that
sort
of
thing
or
the
world
would
come
to
an
perhaps
so
when
will
the
cause
come
on
for
trial
will
depend
we
have
gone
through
the
preliminaries
but
have
asked
for
time
i
am
most
anxious
to
find
out
more
about
the
letter
which
gave
us
the
great
news
lady
farrington
insists
that
the
writer
was
your
father
still
alive
seems
incredible
but
i
am
making
all
possible
inquiries
the
letter
such
as
it
was
was
scrawled
upon
the
back
of
an
old
invoice
for
goods
the
invoice
was
for
powder
and
two
shot
guns
and
the
goods
were
supplied
by
jan
steen
of
pietermaritzburg
in
you
followed
up
that
clue
the
best
of
my
ability
i
sent
a
special
messenger
to
the
cape
of
good
hope
his
instructions
were
to
trace
the
invoice
from
jan
steen
if
possible
to
the
person
who
eventually
received
the
goods
it
may
take
some
little
time
to
ferret
out
but
i
can
trust
jimlett
implicitly
in
all
such
affairs
of
course
if
we
could
only
produce
herbert
farrington
alias
corporal
smith
propriâ
the
case
would
be
you
any
news
yet
from
jimlett
short
business
communications
reporting
progress
in
his
last
i
was
informed
that
he
had
arrived
at
pietermaritzburg
and
had
easily
come
upon
jan
steen
that
was
where
the
real
difficulty
began
of
they
help
him
in
any
way
were
not
very
cordial
he
says
deal
largely
with
the
or
persons
employed
in
the
contraband
trade
across
the
frontier
of
natal
their
business
is
a
large
one
a
lucrative
one
and
possibly
dangerous
hence
jimlett
had
to
overcome
considerable
reticence
on
their
part
they
acknowledged
their
invoice
that
indeed
it
was
impossible
to
repudiate
but
they
decline
to
say
to
whom
the
arms
were
supplied
indeed
they
declare
they
can
not
as
all
such
goods
pass
through
many
there
the
matter
stands
the
present
yes
we
must
wait
patiently
i
confess
i
have
confidence
still
in
jimlett
and
feel
sure
he
will
unravel
the
mystery
if
any
man
can
perhaps
we
shall
hear
more
next
nothing
came
however
neither
next
mail
nor
the
one
after
meanwhile
the
suit
dragged
itself
slowly
along
and
went
through
the
usual
phases
and
formalities
at
first
it
attracted
but
little
notice
from
and
excited
but
little
interest
in
the
public
the
announcement
in
the
daily
papers
that
a
suit
was
pending
which
promised
to
be
as
involved
and
interminable
as
the
tichborne
trial
was
classed
with
the
paragraphs
of
the
and
treated
with
contempt
no
one
read
the
short
accounts
which
appeared
in
the
law
notices
and
it
was
not
until
the
spring
term
when
the
case
was
duly
opened
that
general
attention
was
aroused
there
was
an
element
of
romance
in
it
the
young
claimant
not
in
this
case
an
overgrown
but
a
gallant
soldier
bearing
the
commission
and
that
envied
decoration
the
victoria
cross
was
entitled
to
a
certain
respect
and
soon
won
the
suffrages
of
the
crowd
nor
was
society
against
him
sir
rupert
was
not
beloved
in
his
own
walk
of
life
the
great
world
is
generally
indifferent
and
often
unjust
but
it
is
seldom
very
wrong
in
its
estimate
of
those
who
belong
to
it
wicked
people
may
prosper
well
enough
and
long
be
fairly
spoken
of
but
never
if
they
are
unpleasant
and
disagreeable
to
boot
sir
rupert
had
all
these
bad
traits
and
was
in
consequence
universally
unpopular
his
character
stood
out
all
the
blacker
as
the
case
proceeded
and
his
treatment
of
the
dowager
lady
farrington
was
set
forth
in
its
true
light
nor
was
he
absolved
from
harshness
in
his
attitude
towards
herbert
larkins
as
a
lad
the
law
nevertheless
was
as
it
seemed
altogether
on
the
side
of
the
strong
the
case
was
good
so
far
as
it
went
but
as
was
feared
there
were
several
serious
flaws
in
it
lady
peculiarities
were
brought
out
into
somewhat
unfavourable
prominence
in
the
and
elicited
considerable
merriment
the
counsel
made
the
most
of
her
craze
and
turned
her
inside
out
so
to
speak
on
the
subject
of
claimants
in
general
and
herbert
in
particular
larkins
was
so
very
stout
and
positive
that
her
statements
could
not
be
shaken
but
after
all
although
hers
was
the
evidence
most
relevant
it
was
entirely
uncorroborated
and
unsupported
not
even
herbert
with
his
undoubtedly
honest
bearing
could
turn
the
scale
and
the
case
day
after
day
was
going
more
and
more
in
favour
of
sir
rupert
when
all
at
once
came
a
report
from
jimlett
which
inspired
the
plaintiffs
with
fresh
almost
exaggerated
hopes
chapter
xii
turning
the
scale
late
in
the
afternoon
at
westminster
the
court
occupied
as
it
had
been
these
months
past
with
the
great
farrington
trial
it
had
already
lasted
so
long
that
the
opening
address
was
almost
forgotten
yet
nothing
definite
had
come
out
the
case
for
the
claimant
was
approaching
conclusion
netherpoint
held
on
bravely
to
the
last
like
a
true
man
he
was
prepared
to
die
game
but
it
was
quite
clear
that
quantlet
the
leader
on
the
opposite
side
was
only
biding
his
time
to
smash
netherpoint
and
his
case
into
little
bits
interest
had
flagged
since
the
commencement
of
the
trial
it
was
felt
that
the
whole
thing
was
rather
a
hollow
affair
which
must
presently
collapse
utterly
only
the
parties
to
the
suit
retained
their
anxiety
lady
farrington
like
the
old
lady
in
jarndice
jarndice
sat
near
herbert
and
still
strove
but
in
vain
to
be
calm
sir
rupert
farrington
was
also
in
court
his
dark
face
wearing
an
implacable
frown
which
deepened
as
his
eyes
rested
upon
the
unscrupulous
aggressors
who
sought
to
rob
him
of
his
rights
and
all
he
possessed
herbert
larkins
met
his
glance
without
quailing
but
without
any
particular
buoyancy
of
expression
he
was
in
truth
growing
a
little
hopeless
and
almost
wished
the
case
at
an
end
everybody
else
seemed
heartily
sick
of
the
thing
even
the
presiding
judge
had
yawned
distinctly
three
times
in
as
many
minutes
after
which
he
asked
his
brother
netherpoint
when
he
hoped
to
conclude
shortly
there
are
but
two
or
three
additional
witnesses
witnesses
i
trust
persons
prepared
to
give
evidence
relative
to
the
issue
decidedly
most
decidedly
there
is
reuben
bosher
and
hey
what
mean
i
can
not
hear
what
you
this
was
to
bellhouse
who
had
come
behind
him
and
was
whispering
rather
excitedly
for
him
in
the
ear
impossible
they
give
us
an
hour
out
of
the
then
a
few
more
hurried
words
passed
between
the
lawyers
but
further
conversation
was
rendered
impossible
by
the
impatience
and
irritability
of
the
judge
is
the
meaning
of
this
interruption
it
is
not
to
be
tolerated
how
much
longer
may
i
ask
brother
netherpoint
do
you
propose
to
occupy
the
time
of
the
court
if
you
have
nothing
further
to
bring
forward
i
must
beg
of
you
to
sit
important
intelligence
has
arrived
evidence
which
will
probably
change
the
whole
complexion
of
the
case
we
have
just
heard
of
a
witness
whom
i
shall
require
to
call
he
in
attendance
he
ought
to
be
we
can
not
have
the
time
of
the
court
wasted
any
more
you
have
had
plenty
of
opportunities
if
you
lose
them
it
is
your
own
witness
has
only
just
been
heard
of
i
shall
insist
upon
your
proceeding
with
the
must
move
then
for
a
fresh
and
what
is
this
witness
and
why
is
he
not
here
is
not
here
because
there
has
not
been
time
to
bring
him
he
has
been
at
the
cape
of
good
hope
for
nearly
thirty
years
far
back
in
the
wilds
or
as
it
is
called
i
believe
is
his
name
netherpoint
paused
and
looked
round
so
as
to
give
everyone
full
opportunity
of
hearing
what
he
said
name
is
sir
herbert
there
was
a
sensation
in
the
court
lady
farrington
with
a
shriek
seized
herbert
convulsively
by
the
hands
and
ejaculating
knew
it
i
knew
it
swooned
away
sir
rupert
farrington
as
he
still
claimed
to
be
called
half
rose
in
his
seat
as
if
determined
to
protest
against
this
new
and
most
audacious
attempt
at
fraud
there
was
a
flutter
of
excitement
a
murmur
of
voices
in
the
body
of
the
court
the
solicitors
whispered
and
winked
significantly
to
one
another
and
the
bar
generally
woke
up
to
give
attention
to
what
had
long
been
a
threadbare
and
uninteresting
affair
meanwhile
the
judge
had
been
scanning
his
notes
assiduously
sir
counsel
and
solicitors
had
been
equally
busy
with
brief
and
papers
while
netherpoint
and
bellhouse
had
continued
in
close
confabulation
and
interchanging
memoranda
and
ideas
herbert
farrington
the
judge
asked
at
length
snappishly
and
garrulously
is
no
such
person
in
existence
that
i
am
aware
of
at
present
the
young
gentleman
who
is
one
of
the
plaintiffs
has
no
right
to
the
title
until
he
has
proved
his
claim
do
not
speak
of
him
but
of
his
father
is
dead
he
disappeared
a
generation
ago
said
quantlet
rising
me
that
assumption
is
entirely
unwarrantable
replied
netherpoint
undertake
to
prove
the
contrary
and
will
produce
the
man
quantlet
sat
down
grumbling
loudly
the
words
witnesses
were
heard
audibly
among
his
complaints
is
this
person
asked
his
lordship
good
enough
to
inform
the
court
of
all
particulars
brother
netherpoint
if
you
spring
a
mine
like
this
without
giving
warning
you
owe
it
to
the
court
to
make
the
fullest
am
quite
ready
you
shall
have
the
whole
what
is
now
to
be
told
so
closely
concerns
our
hero
that
it
must
be
given
at
some
length
after
much
delay
and
many
rebuffs
inquiries
had
been
crowned
at
length
with
success
tracing
the
line
which
the
commonly
took
he
had
been
gradually
drawn
towards
the
frontier
of
natal
while
hesitating
to
pass
beyond
the
boundary
rumours
reached
him
of
englishmen
settled
among
the
native
tribes
of
one
in
particular
who
had
risen
to
some
eminence
among
them
and
was
reputed
rich
in
wives
and
cattle
this
personage
he
thought
might
give
him
some
information
and
not
without
delay
and
difficulty
he
made
his
way
to
his
kraal
the
object
of
inquiries
was
stated
with
some
caution
to
the
english
settler
who
had
been
so
long
resident
in
his
savage
home
that
he
was
almost
denationalised
but
if
the
chief
had
lost
many
of
the
customs
of
civilised
life
just
as
he
had
discarded
the
dress
he
had
assumed
in
place
of
it
much
of
that
wily
caution
peculiar
to
the
savage
jimlett
could
get
nothing
out
of
him
for
a
long
time
the
chief
displayed
as
much
if
not
more
circumspection
than
the
clerk
it
seemed
impossible
to
draw
a
word
out
of
him
he
still
spoke
english
fluently
and
was
perfectly
calm
and
see
what
you
are
driving
at
he
said
after
long
fencing
not
throw
your
cards
down
and
be
open
with
me
the
best
way
to
deal
with
a
wild
man
who
are
you
looking
for
really
and
why
want
some
one
to
tell
me
whether
herbert
farrington
youngest
son
of
the
last
baronet
farrington
is
alive
or
why
take
up
the
title
and
the
family
property
and
see
that
his
son
comes
into
it
after
son
he
had
no
do
you
know
mother
died
in
childbirth
she
seem
very
fully
informed
what
more
do
you
know
i
wish
i
have
never
sought
to
know
perhaps
had
no
business
to
know
not
is
lady
farrington
still
alive
but
the
title
is
held
by
sir
rupert
cousin
i
know
how
many
times
removed
what
right
had
he
to
it
was
the
did
lady
farrington
drive
her
son
from
home
by
poor
herbert
no
wonder
he
has
regretted
it
bitterly
she
is
now
doing
her
utmost
to
retrieve
the
wrong
she
has
inflicted
she
has
welcomed
educated
and
been
a
staunch
friend
to
son
now
that
the
marriage
between
herbert
and
ann
orde
is
proved
another
link
or
two
is
all
we
need
to
establish
the
younger
herbert
as
the
rightful
owner
of
the
title
and
can
not
be
quite
that
not
just
yet
his
father
the
herbert
farrington
is
still
is
he
to
be
found
will
you
take
me
to
him
you
shall
be
liberally
want
no
reward
and
you
need
not
go
far
i
am
the
this
was
the
overwhelming
evidence
which
netherpoint
proposed
to
bring
and
for
which
he
claimed
time
from
the
court
it
was
conceded
and
the
case
was
held
over
to
the
following
term
meanwhile
gossip
busied
itself
once
more
with
the
case
the
news
of
the
missing
son
was
freely
discussed
opinions
differed
very
widely
some
held
stoutly
that
he
was
the
man
himself
others
that
barefaced
imposture
was
meant
and
would
in
the
long
run
be
brought
home
to
the
parties
concerned
it
was
a
repetition
of
the
great
tichborne
case
although
on
a
much
smaller
scale
then
the
herbert
farrington
appeared
at
first
gaunt
wild
unkempt
from
his
long
life
in
the
bush
but
unmistakably
a
gentleman
still
and
soon
resuming
the
manners
and
tone
proper
to
his
birth
and
class
he
was
recognised
at
once
by
all
survivors
bellhouse
knew
him
and
could
swear
to
him
so
could
larkins
the
rector
of
had
no
doubt
as
to
his
identity
last
of
all
his
mother
whose
injustice
had
driven
him
forth
fell
into
his
arms
imploring
his
forgiveness
and
declared
he
was
hardly
at
all
changed
he
was
in
truth
her
own
son
like
her
impressionable
flighty
sometimes
strange
in
his
demeanour
and
ways
his
whole
life
was
indeed
an
evidence
of
these
inherited
traits
another
less
sensitive
nature
would
have
given
in
sooner
but
he
so
bitterly
resented
his
harshness
that
he
would
never
bring
himself
to
hold
out
his
hand
to
her
first
then
in
his
loneliness
and
isolation
after
his
death
of
which
he
had
been
informed
he
broke
altogether
with
the
world
and
flew
to
the
wilds
from
which
as
we
have
seen
he
was
brought
back
with
extreme
difficulty
at
the
eleventh
hour
but
he
arrived
in
time
to
turn
the
scale
and
secure
victory
for
his
cause
within
a
month
or
two
of
the
termination
of
the
trial
herbert
farrington
bearing
now
his
proper
name
returned
to
the
rock
he
was
something
of
a
celebrity
as
the
hero
of
a
great
trial
which
had
been
decided
in
his
favour
and
altogether
a
different
person
from
the
unknown
larkins
who
had
aspired
so
high
he
was
well
received
with
one
exception
on
every
side
he
was
and
made
much
of
in
his
own
regiment
and
received
cordial
congratulation
through
the
garrison
and
wherever
he
went
but
general
prioleau
was
for
a
long
time
unforgiving
when
an
man
is
embittered
against
any
one
he
is
perhaps
more
persistent
in
his
dislike
than
if
his
temper
were
more
harsh
for
a
long
time
he
held
out
against
herbert
and
closed
his
doors
to
him
but
continual
dropping
will
wear
a
stone
and
prioleau
who
had
now
completely
changed
in
her
views
with
regard
to
herbert
kept
up
a
continuous
flow
of
eulogistic
words
before
which
the
general
gradually
succumbed
how
could
he
hope
to
hold
his
garrison
when
there
were
traitors
within
he
might
refuse
to
see
herbert
but
prioleau
and
edith
met
him
elsewhere
and
the
went
on
in
spite
of
him
under
his
very
nose
edith
too
when
taxed
with
her
misconduct
so
plainly
gave
her
father
to
understand
that
she
would
marry
herbert
farrington
and
no

the

was
compelled
at
length

place
the

year
captain
mountcharles
felt
it
as
a
personal
affront
and
resigned
his
appointment
so
herbert
was
presently
made
in
his
place
by
degrees
the
general
has
been
entirely
won
over
by
his
devotion
to
his
duties
and
brought
although
tardily
to
acknowledge
his
worth
nothing
will
induce
herbert
to
resign
his
profession
his
regimental
promotion
is
assured
and
as
he
is
keen
to
take
active
employment
wherever
it
offers
a
desire
in

true
wife
always
encourages
him
he
is
certain

rise

high
honours

as
a
thoroughly
deserving

dispose
of
the
remaining
characters
in
this
story
it
seemed
as
though
old
lady
farrington
felt
when

was
won
that
her
mission
was
ended
she
died
happily
at
peace
with
every
one
in
the
following
year
her
son
the
new
baronet
sir
herbert
farrington
settled
at
the
hall
for
a
time
but
restlessness
soon
took
possession
of
him
and
he
pined
for
the
wilds
which
had
so
long
been
his
home
when
last
heard
of
by
his
son
herbert
he
was
at
the
head
of
an
exploring
party
somewhere
near

tanganyika
and
meant
to
be
absent
for
some
years
as
for

he
retired
into
obscurity
to
eat
out
his
heart
with
envy
hatred
and
all
uncharitableness
he
was
not
overburdened
with
cash
but
through
young
good
offices
a
moderate
allowance
was
made
him
from
