chapter
i
the
miracle
kazan
lay
mute
and
motionless
his
gray
nose
between
his
forepaws
his
eyes
half
closed
a
rock
could
have
appeared
scarcely
less
lifeless
than
he
not
a
muscle
twitched
not
a
hair
moved
not
an
eyelid
quivered
yet
every
drop
of
the
wild
blood
in
his
splendid
body
was
racing
in
a
ferment
of
excitement
that
kazan
had
never
before
experienced
every
nerve
and
fiber
of
his
wonderful
muscles
was
tense
as
steel
wire
wolf
husky
he
had
lived
the
four
years
of
his
life
in
the
wilderness
he
had
felt
the
pangs
of
starvation
he
knew
what
it
meant
to
freeze
he
had
listened
to
the
wailing
winds
of
the
long
arctic
night
over
the
barrens
he
had
heard
the
thunder
of
the
torrent
and
the
cataract
and
had
cowered
under
the
mighty
crash
of
the
storm
his
throat
and
sides
were
scarred
by
battle
and
his
eyes
were
red
with
the
blister
of
the
snows
he
was
called
kazan
the
wild
dog
because
he
was
a
giant
among
his
kind
and
as
fearless
even
as
the
men
who
drove
him
through
the
perils
of
a
frozen
world
he
had
never
known
fear
until
now
he
had
never
felt
in
him
before
the
desire
to
not
even
on
that
terrible
day
in
the
forest
when
he
had
fought
and
killed
the
big
gray
lynx
he
did
not
know
what
it
was
that
frightened
him
but
he
knew
that
he
was
in
another
world
and
that
many
things
in
it
startled
and
alarmed
him
it
was
his
first
glimpse
of
civilization
he
wished
that
his
master
would
come
back
into
the
strange
room
where
he
had
left
him
it
was
a
room
filled
with
hideous
things
there
were
great
human
faces
on
the
wall
but
they
did
not
move
or
speak
but
stared
at
him
in
a
way
he
had
never
seen
people
look
before
he
remembered
having
looked
on
a
master
who
lay
very
quiet
and
very
cold
in
the
snow
and
he
had
sat
back
on
his
haunches
and
wailed
forth
the
death
song
but
these
people
on
the
walls
looked
alive
and
yet
seemed
dead
suddenly
kazan
lifted
his
ears
a
little
he
heard
steps
then
low
voices
one
of
them
was
his
master
voice
but
the
other
it
sent
a
little
tremor
through
him
once
so
long
ago
that
it
must
have
been
in
his
puppyhood
days
he
seemed
to
have
had
a
dream
of
a
laugh
that
was
like
the
girl
laugh
a
laugh
that
was
all
at
once
filled
with
a
wonderful
happiness
the
thrill
of
a
wonderful
love
and
a
sweetness
that
made
kazan
lift
his
head
as
they
came
in
he
looked
straight
at
them
his
red
eyes
gleaming
at
once
he
knew
that
she
must
be
dear
to
his
master
for
his
master
arm
was
about
her
in
the
glow
of
the
light
he
saw
that
her
hair
was
very
bright
and
that
there
was
the
color
of
the
crimson
vine
in
her
face
and
the
blue
of
the
flower
in
her
shining
eyes
suddenly
she
saw
him
and
with
a
little
cry
darted
toward
him
stop
shouted
the
man
he
dangerous
kazan
she
was
on
her
knees
beside
him
all
fluffy
and
sweet
and
beautiful
her
eyes
shining
wonderfully
her
hands
about
to
touch
him
should
he
cringe
back
should
he
snap
was
she
one
of
the
things
on
the
wall
and
his
enemy
should
he
leap
at
her
white
throat
he
saw
the
man
running
forward
pale
as
death
then
her
hand
fell
upon
his
head
and
the
touch
sent
a
thrill
through
him
that
quivered
in
every
nerve
of
his
body
with
both
hands
she
turned
up
his
head
her
face
was
very
close
and
he
heard
her
say
almost
sobbingly
and
you
are
kazan
dear
old
kazan
my
kazan
my
hero
dog
who
brought
him
home
to
me
when
all
the
others
had
died
my
kazan
my
hero
and
then
miracle
of
miracles
her
face
was
crushed
down
against
him
and
he
felt
her
sweet
warm
touch
in
those
moments
kazan
did
not
move
he
scarcely
breathed
it
seemed
a
long
time
before
the
girl
lifted
her
face
from
him
and
when
she
did
there
were
tears
in
her
blue
eyes
and
the
man
was
standing
above
them
his
hands
gripped
tight
his
jaws
set
i
never
knew
him
to
let
any
one
touch
him
with
their
naked
hand
he
said
in
a
tense
wondering
voice
move
back
quietly
isobel
good
heaven
look
at
that
kazan
whined
softly
his
bloodshot
eyes
on
the
girl
face
he
wanted
to
feel
her
hand
again
he
wanted
to
touch
her
face
would
they
beat
him
with
a
club
he
wondered
if
he
he
meant
no
harm
now
he
would
kill
for
her
he
cringed
toward
her
inch
by
inch
his
eyes
never
faltering
he
heard
what
the
man
said
good
heaven
look
at
that
and
he
shuddered
but
no
blow
fell
to
drive
him
back
his
cold
muzzle
touched
her
filmy
dress
and
she
looked
at
him
without
moving
her
wet
eyes
blazing
like
stars
see
she
whispered
see
half
an
inch
more
an
inch
two
inches
and
he
gave
his
big
gray
body
a
hunch
toward
her
now
his
muzzle
traveled
slowly
upward
over
her
foot
to
her
lap
and
at
last
touched
the
warm
little
hand
that
lay
there
his
eyes
were
still
on
her
face
he
saw
a
queer
throbbing
in
her
bare
white
throat
and
then
a
trembling
of
her
lips
as
she
looked
up
at
the
man
with
a
wonderful
look
he
too
knelt
down
beside
them
and
put
his
arm
about
the
girl
again
and
patted
the
dog
on
his
head
kazan
did
not
like
the
man
touch
he
mistrusted
it
as
nature
had
taught
him
to
mistrust
the
touch
of
all
men
hands
but
he
permitted
it
because
he
saw
that
it
in
some
way
pleased
the
girl
kazan
old
boy
you
would
hurt
her
would
you
said
his
master
softly
we
both
love
her
do
we
boy
ca
help
it
can
we
and
she
ours
kazan
all
she
belongs
to
you
and
to
me
and
going
to
take
care
of
her
all
our
lives
and
if
we
ever
have
to
fight
for
her
like
hell
wo
we
eh
kazan
old
boy
for
a
long
time
after
they
left
him
where
he
was
lying
on
the
rug
kazan
eyes
did
not
leave
the
girl
he
watched
and
listened
and
all
the
time
there
grew
more
and
more
in
him
the
craving
to
creep
up
to
them
and
touch
the
girl
hand
or
her
dress
or
her
foot
after
a
time
his
master
said
something
and
with
a
little
laugh
the
girl
jumped
up
and
ran
to
a
big
square
shining
thing
that
stood
crosswise
in
a
corner
and
which
had
a
row
of
white
teeth
longer
than
his
own
body
he
had
wondered
what
those
teeth
were
for
the
girl
fingers
touched
them
now
and
all
the
whispering
of
winds
that
he
had
ever
heard
all
the
music
of
the
waterfalls
and
the
rapids
and
the
trilling
of
birds
in
could
not
equal
the
sounds
they
made
it
was
his
first
music
for
a
moment
it
startled
and
frightened
him
and
then
he
felt
the
fright
pass
away
and
a
strange
tingling
in
his
body
he
wanted
to
sit
back
on
his
haunches
and
howl
as
he
had
howled
at
the
billion
stars
in
the
skies
on
cold
winter
nights
but
something
kept
him
from
doing
that
it
was
the
girl
slowly
he
began
slinking
toward
her
he
felt
the
eyes
of
the
man
upon
him
and
stopped
then
a
little
more
inches
at
a
time
with
his
throat
and
jaw
straight
out
along
the
floor
he
was
to
her
across
the
room
when
the
wonderful
sounds
grew
very
soft
and
very
low
go
on
he
heard
the
man
urge
in
a
low
quick
voice
go
on
stop
the
girl
turned
her
head
saw
kazan
cringing
there
on
the
floor
and
continued
to
play
the
man
was
still
looking
but
his
eyes
could
not
keep
kazan
back
now
he
went
nearer
still
nearer
until
at
last
his
outreaching
muzzle
touched
her
dress
where
it
lay
piled
on
the
floor
and
then
he
lay
trembling
for
she
had
begun
to
sing
he
had
heard
a
cree
woman
crooning
in
front
of
her
tepee
he
had
heard
the
wild
chant
of
the
caribou
song
but
he
had
never
heard
anything
like
this
wonderful
sweetness
that
fell
from
the
lips
of
the
girl
he
forgot
his
master
presence
now
quietly
cringingly
so
that
she
would
not
know
he
lifted
his
head
he
saw
her
looking
at
him
there
was
something
in
her
wonderful
eyes
that
gave
him
confidence
and
he
laid
his
head
in
her
lap
for
the
second
time
he
felt
the
touch
of
a
woman
hand
and
he
closed
his
eyes
with
a
long
sighing
breath
the
music
stopped
there
came
a
little
fluttering
sound
above
him
like
a
laugh
and
a
sob
in
one
he
heard
his
master
cough
i
always
loved
the
old
rascal
but
i
never
thought
he
do
that
he
said
and
his
voice
sounded
queer
to
kazan
chapter
ii
into
the
north
wonderful
days
followed
for
kazan
he
missed
the
forests
and
deep
snows
he
missed
the
daily
strife
of
keeping
his
in
trace
the
yapping
at
his
heels
the
straight
long
pull
over
the
open
spaces
and
the
barrens
he
missed
the
koosh
koosh
of
the
driver
the
spiteful
snap
of
his
whip
and
that
yelping
and
straining
behind
him
that
told
him
he
had
his
followers
in
line
but
something
had
come
to
take
the
place
of
that
which
he
missed
it
was
in
the
room
in
the
air
all
about
him
even
when
the
girl
or
his
master
was
not
near
wherever
she
had
been
he
found
the
presence
of
that
strange
thing
that
took
away
his
loneliness
it
was
the
woman
scent
and
sometimes
it
made
him
whine
softly
when
the
girl
herself
was
actually
with
him
he
was
not
lonely
nights
when
he
should
have
been
out
howling
at
the
stars
he
was
not
lonely
because
one
night
he
prowled
about
until
he
found
a
certain
door
and
when
the
girl
opened
that
door
in
the
morning
she
found
him
curled
up
tight
against
it
she
had
reached
down
and
hugged
him
the
thick
smother
of
her
long
hair
falling
all
over
him
in
a
delightful
perfume
thereafter
she
placed
a
rug
before
the
door
for
him
to
sleep
on
all
through
the
long
nights
he
knew
that
she
was
just
beyond
the
door
and
he
was
content
each
day
he
thought
less
and
less
of
the
wild
places
and
more
of
her
then
there
came
the
beginning
of
the
change
there
was
a
strange
hurry
and
excitement
around
him
and
the
girl
paid
less
attention
to
him
he
grew
uneasy
he
sniffed
the
change
in
the
air
and
he
began
to
study
his
master
face
then
there
came
the
morning
very
early
when
the
babiche
collar
and
the
iron
chain
were
fastened
to
him
again
not
until
he
had
followed
his
master
out
through
the
door
and
into
the
street
did
he
begin
to
understand
they
were
sending
him
away
he
sat
suddenly
back
on
his
haunches
and
refused
to
budge
come
kazan
coaxed
the
man
come
on
boy
he
hung
back
and
showed
his
white
fangs
he
expected
the
lash
of
a
whip
or
the
blow
of
a
club
but
neither
came
his
master
laughed
and
took
him
back
to
the
house
when
they
left
it
again
the
girl
was
with
them
and
walked
with
her
hand
touching
his
head
it
was
she
who
persuaded
him
to
leap
up
through
a
big
dark
hole
into
the
still
darker
interior
of
a
car
and
it
was
she
who
lured
him
to
the
darkest
corner
of
all
where
his
master
fastened
his
chain
then
they
went
out
laughing
like
two
children
for
hours
after
that
kazan
lay
still
and
tense
listening
to
the
queer
rumble
of
wheels
under
him
several
times
those
wheels
stopped
and
he
heard
voices
outside
at
last
he
was
sure
that
he
heard
a
familiar
voice
and
he
strained
at
his
chain
and
whined
the
closed
door
slid
back
a
man
with
a
lantern
climbed
in
followed
by
his
master
he
paid
no
attention
to
them
but
glared
out
through
the
opening
into
the
gloom
of
night
he
almost
broke
loose
when
he
leaped
down
upon
the
white
snow
but
when
he
saw
no
one
there
he
stood
rigid
sniffing
the
air
over
him
were
the
stars
he
had
howled
at
all
his
life
and
about
him
were
the
forests
black
and
silent
shutting
them
in
like
a
wall
vainly
he
sought
for
that
one
scent
that
was
missing
and
thorpe
heard
the
low
note
of
grief
in
his
shaggy
throat
he
took
the
lantern
and
held
it
above
his
head
at
the
same
time
loosening
his
hold
on
the
leash
at
that
signal
there
came
a
voice
from
out
of
the
night
it
came
from
behind
them
and
kazan
whirled
so
suddenly
that
the
loosely
held
chain
slipped
from
the
man
hand
he
saw
the
glow
of
other
lanterns
and
then
once
more
the
voice
he
was
off
like
a
bolt
thorpe
laughed
to
himself
as
he
followed
the
old
pirate
he
chuckled
when
he
came
to
the
space
back
of
the
caboose
thorpe
found
kazan
crouching
down
at
a
woman
feet
it
was
thorpe
wife
she
smiled
triumphantly
at
him
as
he
came
up
out
of
the
gloom
you
won
he
laughed
not
unhappily
i
have
wagered
my
last
dollar
he
would
do
that
for
any
voice
on
earth
you
won
kazan
you
brute
i
lost
you
his
face
suddenly
sobered
as
isobel
stooped
to
pick
up
the
end
of
the
chain
he
yours
issy
he
added
quickly
but
you
must
let
me
care
for
him
until
we
give
me
the
chain
i
wo
trust
him
even
now
he
a
wolf
i
seen
him
take
an
indian
hand
off
at
a
single
snap
seen
him
tear
out
another
dog
jugular
in
one
leap
he
an
outlaw
a
bad
dog
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
he
hung
to
me
like
a
hero
and
brought
me
out
alive
i
ca
trust
him
give
me
the
chain
he
did
not
finish
with
the
snarl
of
a
wild
beast
kazan
had
leaped
to
his
feet
his
lips
drew
up
and
bared
his
long
fangs
his
spine
stiffened
and
with
a
sudden
cry
of
warning
thorpe
dropped
a
hand
to
the
revolver
at
his
belt
kazan
paid
no
attention
to
him
another
form
had
approached
out
of
the
night
and
stood
now
in
the
circle
of
illumination
made
by
the
lanterns
it
was
mccready
who
was
to
accompany
thorpe
and
his
young
wife
back
to
the
red
river
camp
where
thorpe
was
in
charge
of
the
building
of
the
new
the
man
was
straight
powerfully
built
and
clean
shaven
his
jaw
was
so
square
that
it
was
brutal
and
there
was
a
glow
in
his
eyes
that
was
almost
like
the
passion
in
kazan
as
he
looked
at
isobel
her
red
and
white
had
slipped
free
of
her
head
and
was
hanging
over
her
shoulder
the
dull
blaze
of
the
lanterns
shone
in
the
warm
glow
of
her
hair
her
cheeks
were
flushed
and
her
eyes
suddenly
turned
to
him
were
as
blue
as
the
bluest
flower
and
glowed
like
diamonds
mccready
shifted
his
gaze
and
instantly
her
hand
fell
on
kazan
head
for
the
first
time
the
dog
did
not
seem
to
feel
her
touch
he
still
snarled
at
mccready
the
rumbling
menace
in
his
throat
growing
deeper
thorpe
wife
tugged
at
the
chain
down
kazan
down
she
commanded
at
the
sound
of
her
voice
he
relaxed
down
she
repeated
and
her
free
hand
fell
on
his
head
again
he
slunk
to
her
feet
but
his
lips
were
still
drawn
back
thorpe
was
watching
him
he
wondered
at
the
deadly
venom
that
shot
from
the
wolfish
eyes
and
looked
at
mccready
the
big
guide
had
uncoiled
his
long
a
strange
look
had
come
into
his
face
he
was
staring
hard
at
kazan
suddenly
he
leaned
forward
with
both
hands
on
his
knees
and
for
a
tense
moment
or
two
he
seemed
to
forget
that
isobel
thorpe
wonderful
blue
eyes
were
looking
at
him
pedro
that
one
word
was
taught
only
to
the
dogs
in
the
service
of
the
northwest
mounted
police
kazan
did
not
move
mccready
straightened
and
quick
as
a
shot
sent
the
long
lash
of
his
whip
curling
out
into
the
night
with
a
crack
like
a
pistol
report
charge
pedro
the
rumble
in
kazan
throat
deepened
to
a
snarling
growl
but
not
a
muscle
of
his
body
moved
mccready
turned
to
thorpe
i
could
have
sworn
that
i
knew
that
dog
he
said
if
it
pedro
thorpe
was
taking
the
chain
only
the
girl
saw
the
look
that
came
for
an
instant
into
mccready
face
it
made
her
shiver
a
few
minutes
before
when
the
train
had
first
stopped
at
les
pas
she
had
offered
her
hand
to
this
man
and
she
had
seen
the
same
thing
then
but
even
as
she
shuddered
she
recalled
the
many
things
her
husband
had
told
her
of
the
forest
people
she
had
grown
to
love
them
to
admire
their
big
rough
manhood
and
loyal
hearts
before
he
had
brought
her
among
them
and
suddenly
she
smiled
at
mccready
struggling
to
overcome
that
thrill
of
fear
and
dislike
he
does
like
you
she
laughed
at
him
softly
wo
you
make
friends
with
him
she
drew
kazan
toward
him
with
thorpe
holding
the
end
of
the
chain
mccready
came
to
her
side
as
she
bent
over
the
dog
his
back
was
to
thorpe
as
he
hunched
down
isobel
bowed
head
was
within
a
foot
of
his
face
he
could
see
the
glow
in
her
cheek
and
the
pouting
curve
of
her
mouth
as
she
quieted
the
low
rumbling
in
kazan
throat
thorpe
stood
ready
to
pull
back
on
the
chain
but
for
a
moment
mccready
was
between
him
and
his
wife
and
he
could
not
see
mccready
face
the
man
eyes
were
not
on
kazan
he
was
staring
at
the
girl
you
brave
he
said
i
do
dare
do
that
he
would
take
off
my
hand
he
took
the
lantern
from
thorpe
and
led
the
way
to
a
narrow
branching
off
from
the
track
hidden
back
in
the
thick
spruce
was
the
camp
that
thorpe
had
left
a
fortnight
before
there
were
two
tents
there
now
in
place
of
the
one
that
he
and
his
guide
had
used
a
big
fire
was
burning
in
front
of
them
close
to
the
fire
was
a
long
sledge
and
fastened
to
trees
just
within
the
outer
circle
of
firelight
kazan
saw
the
shadowy
forms
and
gleaming
eyes
of
his
he
stood
stiff
and
motionless
while
thorpe
fastened
him
to
a
sledge
once
more
he
was
back
in
his
forests
and
in
command
his
mistress
was
laughing
and
clapping
her
hands
delightedly
in
the
excitement
of
the
strange
and
wonderful
life
of
which
she
had
now
become
a
part
thorpe
had
thrown
back
the
flap
of
their
tent
and
she
was
entering
ahead
of
him
she
did
not
look
back
she
spoke
no
word
to
him
he
whined
and
turned
his
red
eyes
on
mccready
in
the
tent
thorpe
was
saying
i
sorry
old
jackpine
would
go
back
with
us

drove
me
down
but
for
love
or
money

woods

book
but
dogs

like
a
stranger
kazan
is
going
to
take
to
him
worth
a
cent
kazan
heard
the
girl
voice
and
stood
rigid
and
motionless
listening
to
it
he
did
not
hear
or
see
mccready
when
he
came
up
stealthily
behind
him
the
man
voice
came
as
suddenly
as
a
shot
at
his
heels
in
an
instant
kazan
cringed
as
if
touched
by
a
lash
got
you
that
time
did
i

devil
whispered
mccready
his
face
strangely

firelight

did
i
chapter
iii
mccready
pays
the
debt
for
a
long
time
after
he
had
uttered
those
words
mccready
sat
in
silence
beside
the
fire
only
for
a
moment
or
two
at
a
time
did
his
eyes
leave
kazan
after
a
little
when
he
was
sure
that
thorpe
and
isobel
had
retired
for
the
night
he
went
into
his
own
tent
and
returned
with
a
flask
of
whisky
during
the
next
he
drank
frequently
then
he
went
over
and
sat
on
the
end
of
the
sledge
just
beyond
the
reach
of
kazan
chain
got
you
did
i
he
repeated
the
effect
of
the
liquor
beginning
to
show
in
the
glitter
of
his
eyes
wonder
who
changed
your
name
pedro
and
how
the
devil
did
come
by
you
ho
ho
if
you
could
only
talk
they
heard
thorpe
voice
inside
the
tent
it
was
followed
by
a
low
girlish
peal
of
laughter
and
mccready
jerked
himself
erect
his
face
blazed
suddenly
red
and
he
rose
to
his
feet
dropping
the
flask
in
his
coat
pocket
walking
around
the
fire
he
tiptoed
cautiously
to
the
shadow
of
a
tree
close
to
the
tent
and
stood
there
for
many
minutes
listening
his
eyes
burned
with
a
fiery
madness
when
he
returned
to
the
sledge
and
kazan
it
was
midnight
before
he
went
into
his
own
tent
in
the
warmth
of
the
fire
kazan
eyes
slowly
closed
he
slumbered
uneasily
and
his
brain
was
filled
with
troubled
pictures
at
times
he
was
fighting
and
his
jaws
snapped
at
others
he
was
straining
at
the
end
of
his
chain
with
mccready
or
his
mistress
just
out
of
reach
he
felt
the
gentle
touch
of
the
girl
hand
again
and
heard
the
wonderful
sweetness
of
her
voice
as
she
sang
to
him
and
his
master
and
his
body
trembled
and
twitched
with
the
thrills
that
had
filled
him
that
night
and
then
the
picture
changed
he
was
running
at
the
head
of
a
splendid
team
six
dogs
of
the
royal
northwest
mounted
police
and
his
master
was
calling
him
pedro
the
scene
shifted
they
were
in
camp
his
master
was
young
and
and
he
helped
from
the
sledge
another
man
whose
hands
were
fastened
in
front
of
him
by
curious
black
rings
again
it
was
later
and
he
was
lying
before
a
great
fire
his
master
was
sitting
opposite
him
with
his
back
to
a
tent
and
as
he
looked
there
came
out
of
the
tent
the
man
with
the
black
rings
only
now
the
rings
were
gone
and
his
hands
were
free
and
in
one
of
them
he
carried
a
heavy
club
he
heard
the
terrible
blow
of
the
club
as
it
fell
on
his
master
head
and
the
sound
of
it
aroused
him
from
his
restless
sleep
he
sprang
to
his
feet
his
spine
stiffening
and
a
snarl
in
his
throat
the
fire
had
died
down
and
the
camp
was
in
the
darker
gloom
that
precedes
dawn
through
that
gloom
kazan
saw
mccready
again
he
was
standing
close
to
the
tent
of
his
mistress
and
he
knew
now
that
this
was
the
man
who
had
worn
the
black
iron
rings
and
that
it
was
he
who
had
beaten
him
with
whip
and
club
for
many
long
days
after
he
had
killed
his
master
mccready
heard
the
menace
in
his
throat
and
came
back
quickly
to
the
fire
he
began
to
whistle
and
draw
the
logs
together
and
as
the
fire
blazed
up
afresh
he
shouted
to
awaken
thorp
and
isobel
in
a
few
minutes
thorpe
appeared
at
the
and
his
wife
followed
him
out
her
loose
hair
rippled
in
billows
of
gold
about
her
shoulders
and
she
sat
down
on
the
sledge
close
to
kazan
and
began
brushing
it
mccready
came
up
behind
her
and
fumbled
among
the
packages
on
the
sledge
as
if
by
accident
one
of
his
hands
buried
itself
for
an
instant
in
the
rich
tresses
that
flowed
down
her
back
she
did
not
at
first
feel
the
caressing
touch
of
his
fingers
and
thorpe
back
was
toward
them
only
kazan
saw
the
stealthy
movement
of
the
hand
the
fondling
clutch
of
the
fingers
in
her
hair
and
the
mad
passion
burning
in
the
eyes
of
the
man
quicker
than
a
lynx
the
dog
had
leaped
the
length
of
his
chain
across
the
sledge
mccready
sprang
back
just
in
time
and
as
kazan
reached
the
end
of
his
chain
he
was
jerked
back
so
that
his
body
struck
sidewise
against
the
girl
thorpe
had
turned
in
time
to
see
the
end
of
the
leap
he
believed
that
kazan
had
sprung
at
isobel
and
in
his
horror
no
word
or
cry
escaped
his
lips
as
he
dragged
her
from
where
she
had
half
fallen
over
the
sledge
he
saw
that
she
was
not
hurt
and
he
reached
for
his
revolver
it
was
in
his
holster
in
the
tent
at
his
feet
was
mccready
whip
and
in
the
passion
of
the
moment
he
seized
it
and
sprang
upon
kazan
the
dog
crouched
in
the
snow
he
made
no
move
to
escape
or
to
attack
only
once
in
his
life
could
he
remember
having
received
a
beating
like
that
which
thorpe
inflicted
upon
him
now
but
not
a
whimper
or
a
growl
escaped
him
illustration
not
another
blow
and
then
suddenly
his
mistress
ran
forward
and
caught
the
whip
poised
above
thorpe
head
not
another
blow
she
cried
and
something
in
her
voice
held
him
from
striking
mccready
did
not
hear
what
she
said
then
but
a
strange
look
came
into
thorpe
eyes
and
without
a
word
he
followed
his
wife
into
their
tent
kazan
did
not
leap
at
me
she
whispered
and
she
was
trembling
with
a
sudden
excitement
her
face
was
deathly
white
that
man
was
behind
me
she
went
on
clutching
her
husband
by
the
arm
i
felt
him
touch
me
and
then
kazan
sprang
he
would
bite
it
the
something
wrong
she
was
almost
sobbing
and
thorpe
drew
her
close
in
his
arms
i
had
thought
before
but
it
strange
he
said
did
mccready
say
something
about
knowing
the
dog
it
possible
perhaps
he
had
kazan
before
and
abused
him
in
a
way
that
the
dog
has
not
forgotten
i
find
out
but
until
i
know
will
you
promise
to
keep
away
from
kazan
isobel
gave
the
promise
when
they
came
out
from
the
tent
kazan
lifted
his
great
head
the
stinging
lash
had
closed
one
of
his
eyes
and
his
mouth
was
dripping
blood
isobel
gave
a
low
sob
but
did
not
go
near
him
half
blinded
he
knew
that
his
mistress
had
stopped
his
punishment
and
he
whined
softly
and
wagged
his
thick
tail
in
the
snow
never
had
he
felt
so
miserable
as
through
the
long
hard
hours
of
the
day
that
followed
when
he
broke
the
trail
for
his
into
the
north
one
of
his
eyes
was
closed
and
filled
with
stinging
fire
and
his
body
was
sore
from
the
blows
of
the
caribou
lash
but
it
was
not
physical
pain
that
gave
the
sullen
droop
to
his
head
and
robbed
his
body
of
that
keen
quick
alertness
of
the
the
commander
of
his
mates
it
was
his
spirit
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
it
was
broken
mccready
had
beaten
him
long
ago
his
master
had
beaten
him
and
during
all
this
day
their
voices
were
fierce
and
vengeful
in
his
ears
but
it
was
his
mistress
who
hurt
him
most
she
held
aloof
from
him
always
beyond
they
reach
of
his
leash
and
when
they
stopped
to
rest
and
again
in
camp
she
looked
at
him
with
strange
and
wondering
eyes
and
did
not
speak
she
too
was
ready
to
beat
him
he
believed
that
and
so
slunk
away
from
her
and
crouched
on
his
belly
in
the
snow
with
him
a
broken
spirit
meant
a
broken
heart
and
that
night
he
lurked
in
one
of
the
deepest
shadows
about
the
and
grieved
alone
none
knew
that
it
was
grief
unless
it
was
the
girl
she
did
not
move
toward
him
she
did
not
speak
to
him
but
she
watched
him
closely
and
studied
him
hardest
when
he
was
looking
at
mccready
later
after
thorpe
and
his
wife
had
gone
into
their
tent
it
began
to
snow
and
the
effect
of
the
snow
upon
mccready
puzzled
kazan
the
man
was
restless
and
he
drank
frequently
from
the
flask
that
he
had
used
the
night
before
in
the
firelight
his
face
grew
redder
and
redder
and
kazan
could
see
the
strange
gleam
of
his
teeth
as
he
gazed
at
the
tent
in
which
his
mistress
was
sleeping
again
and
again
he
went
close
to
that
tent
and
listened
twice
he
heard
movement
the
last
time
it
was
the
sound
of
thorpe
deep
breathing
mccready
hurried
back
to
the
fire
and
turned
his
face
straight
up
to
the
sky
the
snow
was
falling
so
thickly
that
when
he
lowered
his
face
he
blinked
and
wiped
his
eyes
then
he
went
out
into
the
gloom
and
bent
low
over
the
trail
they
had
made
a
few
hours
before
it
was
almost
obliterated
by
the
falling
snow
another
hour
and
there
would
be
no
trail
nothing
the
next
day
to
tell
whoever
might
pass
that
they
had
come
this
way
by
morning
it
would
cover
everything
even
the
fire
if
he
allowed
it
to
die
down
mccready
drank
again
out
in
the
darkness
low
words
of
an
insane
joy
burst
from
his
lips
his
head
was
hot
with
a
drunken
fire
his
heart
beat
madly
but
scarcely
more
furiously
than
did
kazan
when
the
dog
saw
that
mccready
was
returning
a
the
club
he
placed
on
end
against
a
tree
then
he
took
a
lantern
from
the
sledge
and
lighted
it
he
approached
thorpe
the
lantern
in
his
hand
ho
thorpe
thorpe
he
called
there
was
no
answer
he
could
hear
thorpe
breathing
he
drew
the
flap
aside
a
little
and
raised
his
voice
thorpe
still
there
was
no
movement
inside
and
he
untied
the
flap
strings
and
thrust
in
his
lantern
the
light
flashed
on
isobel
golden
head
and
mccready
stared
at
it
his
eyes
burning
like
red
coals
until
he
saw
that
thorpe
was
awakening
quickly
he
dropped
the
flap
and
rustled
it
from
the
outside
ho
thorpe
thorpe
he
called
again
this
time
thorpe
replied
hello
mccready
is
that
you
mccready
drew
the
flap
back
a
little
and
spoke
in
a
low
voice
yes
can
you
come
out
a
minute
something
happening
out
in
the
woods
do
wake
up
your
wife
he
drew
back
and
waited
a
minute
later
thorpe
came
quietly
out
of
the
tent
mccready
pointed
into
the
thick
spruce
i
swear
there
some
one
nosing
around
the
camp
he
said
certain
that
i
saw
a
man
out
there
a
few
minutes
ago
when
i
went
for
a
log
it
a
good
night
for
stealing
dogs
here
you
take
the
lantern
if
i
was
clean
fooled
we
find
a
trail
in
the
snow
he
gave
thorpe
the
lantern
and
picked
up
the
heavy
club
a
growl
rose
in
kazan
throat
but
he
choked
it
back
he
wanted
to
snarl
forth
his
warning
to
leap
at
the
end
of
his
leash
but
he
knew
that
if
he
did
that
they
would
return
and
beat
him
so
he
lay
still
trembling
and
shivering
and
whining
softly
he
watched
them
until
they
disappeared
and
then
waited
listened
at
last
he
heard
the
crunch
of
snow
he
was
not
surprised
to
see
mccready
come
back
alone
he
had
expected
him
to
return
alone
for
he
knew
what
a
club
meant
mccready
face
was
terrible
now
it
was
like
a
beast
he
was
hatless
kazan
slunk
deeper
in
his
shadow
at
the
low
horrible
laugh
that
fell
from
his
lips
for
the
man
still
held
the
club
in
a
moment
he
dropped
that
and
approached
the
tent
he
drew
back
the
flap
and
peered
in
thorpe
wife
was
sleeping
and
as
quietly
as
a
cat
he
entered
and
hung
the
lantern
on
a
nail
in
the
his
movement
did
not
awaken
her
and
for
a
few
moments
he
stood
there
staring
staring
outside
crouching
in
the
deep
shadow
kazan
tried
to
fathom
the
meaning
of
these
strange
things
that
were
happening
why
had
his
master
and
mccready
gone
out
into
the
forest
why
had
not
his
master
returned
it
was
his
master
and
not
mccready
who
belonged
in
that
tent
then
why
was
mccready
there
he
watched
mccready
as
he
entered
and
suddenly
the
dog
was
on
his
feet
his
back
tense
and
bristling
his
limbs
rigid
he
saw
mccready
huge
shadow
on
the
canvas
and
a
moment
later
there
came
a
strange
piercing
cry
in
the
wild
terror
of
that
cry
he
recognized
voice
and
he
leaped
toward
the
tent
the
leash
stopped
him
choking
the
snarl
in
his
throat
he
saw
the
shadows
struggling
now
and
there
came
cry
after
cry
she
was
calling
to
his
master
and
with
his
master
name
she
was
calling
he
leaped
again
and
was
thrown
upon
his
back
a
second
and
a
third
time
he
sprang
the
length
of
the
leash
into
the
night
and
the
babiche
cord
about
his
neck
cut
into
his
flesh
like
a
knife
he
stopped
for
an
instant
gasping
for
breath
the
shadows
were
still
fighting
now
they
were
upright
now
they
were
crumpling
down
with
a
fierce
snarl
he
flung
his
whole
weight
once
more
at
the
end
of
the
chain
there
was
a
snap
as
the
thong
about
his
neck
gave
way
in
half
a
dozen
bounds
kazan
made
the
tent
and
rushed
under
the
flap
with
a
snarl
he
was
at
mccready
throat
the
first
snap
of
his
powerful
jaws
was
death
but
he
did
not
know
that
he
knew
only
that
his
mistress
was
there
and
that
he
was
fighting
for
her
there
came
one
choking
gasping
cry
that
ended
with
a
terrible
sob
it
was
mccready
the
man
sank
from
his
knees
upon
his
back
and
kazan
thrust
his
fangs
deeper
into
his
enemy
throat
he
felt
the
warm
blood
the
dog
mistress
was
calling
to
him
now
she
was
pulling
at
his
shaggy
neck
but
he
would
not
loose
his
hold
not
for
a
long
time
when
he
did
his
mistress
looked
down
once
upon
the
man
and
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
then
she
sank
down
upon
the
blankets
she
was
very
still
her
face
and
hands
were
cold
and
kazan
muzzled
them
tenderly
her
eyes
were
closed
he
snuggled
up
close
against
her
with
his
ready
jaws
turned
toward
the
dead
man
why
was
she
so
still
he
wondered
a
long
time
passed
and
then
she
moved
her
eyes
opened
her
hand
touched
him
then
he
heard
a
step
outside
it
was
his
master
and
with
that
old
thrill
of
fear
fear
of
the
club
he
went
swiftly
to
the
door
yes
there
was
his
master
in
the
firelight
and
in
his
hand
he
held
the
club
he
was
coming
slowly
almost
falling
at
each
step
and
his
face
was
red
with
blood
but
he
had
he
would
beat
him
again
beat
him
terribly
for
hurting
mccready
so
kazan
slipped
quietly
under
the
and
stole
off
into
the
shadows
from
out
the
gloom
of
the
thick
spruce
he
looked
back
and
a
low
whine
of
love
and
grief
rose
and
died
softly
in
his
throat
they
would
beat
him
always
now
after
even
would
beat
him
they
would
hunt
him
down
and
beat
him
when
they
found
him
from
out
of
the
glow
of
the
fire
he
turned
his
wolfish
head
to
the
depths
of
the
forest
there
were
no
clubs
or
stinging
lashes
out
in
that
gloom
they
would
never
find
him
there
for
another
moment
he
wavered
and
then
as
silently
as
one
of
the
wild
creatures
whose
blood
was
partly
his
he
stole
away
into
the
blackness
of
the
night
chapter
iv
free
from
bonds
there
was
a
low
moaning
of
the
wind
in
the
as
kazan
slunk
off
into
the
blackness
and
mystery
of
the
forest
for
hours
he
lay
near
the
camp
his
red
and
blistered
eyes
gazing
steadily
at
the
tent
wherein
the
terrible
thing
had
happened
a
little
while
before
he
knew
now
what
death
was
he
could
tell
it
farther
than
man
he
could
smell
it
in
the
air
and
he
knew
that
there
was
death
all
about
him
and
that
he
was
the
cause
of
it
he
lay
on
his
belly
in
the
deep
snow
and
shivered
and
the
of
him
that
was
dog
whined
in
a
way
while
the
quarter
that
was
wolf
still
revealed
itself
menacingly
in
his
fangs
and
in
the
vengeful
glare
of
his
eyes
three
times
the
man
his
master
came
out
of
the
tent
and
shouted
loudly
kazan
kazan
kazan
three
times
the
woman
came
with
him
in
the
firelight
kazan
could
see
her
shining
hair
streaming
about
her
as
he
had
seen
it
in
the
tent
when
he
had
leaped
up
and
killed
the
other
man
in
her
blue
eyes
there
was
the
same
wild
terror
and
her
face
was
white
as
the
snow
and
the
second
and
third
time
she
too
called
kazan
kazan
kazan
and
all
that
part
of
him
that
was
dog
and
not
wolf
trembled
joyously
at
the
sound
of
her
voice
and
he
almost
crept
in
to
take
his
beating
but
fear
of
the
club
was
the
greater
and
he
held
back
hour
after
hour
until
now
it
was
silent
again
in
the
tent
and
he
could
no
longer
see
their
shadows
and
the
fire
was
dying
down
cautiously
he
crept
out
from
the
thick
gloom
working
his
way
on
his
belly
toward
the
packed
sledge
and
what
remained
of
the
burned
logs
beyond
that
sledge
hidden
in
the
darkness
of
the
trees
was
the
body
of
the
man
he
had
killed
covered
with
a
blanket
thorpe
his
master
had
dragged
it
there
he
lay
down
with
his
nose
to
the
warm
coals
and
his
eyes
leveled
between
his
forepaws
straight
at
the
closed
he
meant
to
keep
awake
to
watch
to
be
ready
to
slink
off
into
the
forest
at
the
first
movement
there
but
a
warmth
was
rising
from
out
of
the
gray
ash
of
the
and
his
eyes
closed
twice
three
times
he
fought
himself
back
into
watchfulness
but
the
last
time
his
eyes
came
only
half
open
and
closed
heavily
again
and
now
in
his
sleep
he
whined
softly
and
the
splendid
muscles
of
his
legs
and
shoulders
twitched
and
sudden
shuddering
ripples
ran
along
his
tawny
spine
thorpe
who
was
in
the
tent
if
he
had
seen
him
would
have
known
that
he
was
dreaming
and
thorpe
wife
whose
golden
head
lay
close
against
his
breast
and
who
shuddered
and
trembled
now
and
then
even
as
kazan
was
doing
would
have
known
what
he
was
dreaming
about
in
his
sleep
he
was
leaping
again
at
the
end
of
his
chain
his
jaws
snapped
like
castanets
of
steel
and
the
sound
awakened
him
and
he
sprang
to
his
feet
his
spine
as
stiff
as
a
brush
and
his
snarling
fangs
bared
like
ivory
knives
he
had
awakened
just
in
time
there
was
movement
in
the
tent
his
master
was
awake
and
if
he
did
not
escape
he
sped
swiftly
into
the
thick
spruce
and
paused
flat
and
hidden
with
only
his
head
showing
from
behind
a
tree
he
knew
that
his
master
would
not
spare
him
three
times
thorpe
had
beaten
him
for
snapping
at
mccready
the
last
time
he
would
have
shot
him
if
the
girl
had
not
saved
him
and
now
he
had
torn
mccready
throat
he
had
taken
the
life
from
him
and
his
master
would
not
spare
him
even
the
woman
could
not
save
him
kazan
was
sorry
that
his
master
had
returned
dazed
and
bleeding
after
he
had
torn
mccready
jugular
then
he
would
have
had
her
always
she
would
have
loved
him
she
did
love
him
and
he
would
have
followed
her
and
fought
for
her
always
and
died
for
her
when
the
time
came
but
thorpe
had
come
in
from
the
forest
again
and
kazan
had
slunk
away
quickly
for
thorpe
meant
to
him
what
all
men
meant
to
him
now
the
club
the
whip
and
the
strange
things
that
spat
fire
and
death
and
now
thorpe
had
come
out
from
the
tent
it
was
approaching
dawn
and
in
his
hand
he
held
a
rifle
a
moment
later
the
girl
came
out
and
her
hand
caught
the
man
arm
they
looked
toward
the
thing
covered
by
the
blanket
then
she
spoke
to
thorpe
and
he
suddenly
straightened
and
threw
back
his
head
kazan
kazan
kazan
he
called
a
shiver
ran
through
kazan
the
man
was
trying
to
inveigle
him
back
he
had
in
his
hand
the
thing
that
killed
kazan
kazan
he
shouted
again
kazan
sneaked
cautiously
back
from
the
tree
he
knew
that
distance
meant
nothing
to
the
cold
thing
of
death
that
thorpe
held
in
his
hand
he
turned
his
head
once
and
whined
softly
and
for
an
instant
a
great
longing
filled
his
reddened
eyes
as
he
saw
the
last
of
the
girl
he
knew
now
that
he
was
leaving
her
forever
and
there
was
an
ache
in
his
heart
that
had
never
been
there
before
a
pain
that
was
not
of
the
club
or
whip
of
cold
or
hunger
but
which
was
greater
than
them
all
and
which
filled
him
with
a
desire
to
throw
back
his
head
and
cry
out
his
loneliness
to
the
gray
emptiness
of
the
sky
back
in
the
camp
the
girl
voice
quivered
he
is
gone
the
man
strong
voice
choked
a
little
yes
he
is
gone
and
i
did
i
give
a
year
of
my
life
if
i
had
whipped
him
yesterday
and
last
night
he
wo
come
back
isobel
thorpe
hand
tightened
on
his
arm
he
will
she
cried
he
wo
leave
me
he
loved
me
if
he
was
savage
and
terrible
and
he
knows
that
i
love
him
he
come
back
listen
from
deep
in
the
forest
there
came
a
long
wailing
howl
filled
with
a
plaintive
sadness
it
was
kazan
farewell
to
the
woman
after
that
cry
kazan
sat
for
a
long
time
on
his
haunches
sniffing
the
new
freedom
of
the
air
and
watching
the
deep
black
pits
in
the
forest
about
him
as
they
faded
away
before
dawn
and
then
since
the
day
the
traders
had
first
bought
him
and
put
him
into
away
over
on
the
mackenzie
he
had
often
thought
of
this
freedom
longingly
the
wolf
blood
in
him
urging
him
to
take
it
but
he
had
never
quite
dared
it
thrilled
him
now
there
were
no
clubs
here
no
whips
none
of
the
whom
he
had
first
learned
to
distrust
and
then
to
hate
it
was
his
misfortune
that
of
wolf
and
the
clubs
instead
of
subduing
him
had
added
to
the
savagery
that
was
born
in
him
men
had
been
his
worst
enemies
they
had
beaten
him
time
and
again
until
he
was
almost
dead
they
called
him
bad
and
stepped
wide
of
him
and
never
missed
the
chance
to
snap
a
whip
over
his
back
his
body
was
covered
with
scars
they
had
given
him
he
had
never
felt
kindness
or
love
until
the
first
night
the
woman
had
put
her
warm
little
hand
on
his
head
and
had
snuggled
her
face
close
down
to
his
while
thorpe
her
husband
had
cried
out
in
horror
he
had
almost
buried
his
fangs
in
her
white
flesh
but
in
an
instant
her
gentle
touch
and
her
sweet
voice
had
sent
through
him
that
wonderful
thrill
that
was
his
first
knowledge
of
love
and
now
it
was
a
man
who
was
driving
him
from
her
away
from
the
hand
that
had
never
held
a
club
or
a
whip
and
he
growled
as
he
trotted
deeper
into
the
forest
he
came
to
the
edge
of
a
swamp
as
day
broke
for
a
time
he
had
been
filled
with
a
strange
uneasiness
and
light
did
not
quite
dispel
it
at
last
he
was
free
of
men
he
could
detect
nothing
that
reminded
him
of
their
hated
presence
in
the
air
but
neither
could
he
smell
the
presence
of
other
dogs
of
the
sledge
the
fire
of
companionship
and
food
and
so
far
back
as
he
could
remember
they
had
always
been
a
part
of
his
life
here
it
was
very
quiet
the
swamp
lay
in
a
hollow
between
two
and
the
spruce
and
cedar
grew
low
and
thick
so
thick
that
there
was
almost
no
snow
under
them
and
day
was
like
twilight
two
things
he
began
to
miss
more
than
all
others
food
and
company
both
the
wolf
and
the
dog
that
was
in
him
demanded
the
first
and
that
part
of
him
that
was
dog
longed
for
the
latter
to
both
desires
the
wolf
blood
that
was
strong
in
him
rose
responsively
it
told
him
that
somewhere
in
this
silent
world
between
the
two
ridges
there
was
companionship
and
that
all
he
had
to
do
to
find
it
was
to
sit
back
on
his
haunches
and
cry
out
his
loneliness
more
than
once
something
trembled
in
his
deep
chest
rose
in
his
throat
and
ended
there
in
a
whine
it
was
the
wolf
howl
not
yet
quite
born
food
came
more
easily
than
voice
toward
midday
he
cornered
a
big
white
rabbit
under
a
log
and
killed
it
the
warm
flesh
and
blood
was
better
than
frozen
fish
or
tallow
and
bran
and
the
feast
he
had
gave
him
confidence
that
afternoon
he
chased
many
rabbits
and
killed
two
more
until
now
he
had
never
known
the
delight
of
pursuing
and
killing
at
will
even
though
he
did
not
eat
all
he
killed
but
there
was
no
fight
in
the
rabbits
they
died
too
easily
they
were
very
sweet
and
tender
to
eat
when
he
was
hungry
but
the
first
thrill
of
killing
them
passed
away
after
a
time
he
wanted
something
bigger
he
no
longer
slunk
along
as
if
he
were
afraid
or
as
if
he
wanted
to
remain
hidden
he
held
his
head
up
his
back
bristled
his
tail
swung
free
and
bushy
like
a
wolf
every
hair
in
his
body
quivered
with
the
electric
energy
of
life
and
action
he
traveled
north
and
west
it
was
the
call
of
early
days
the
days
away
up
on
the
mackenzie
the
mackenzie
was
a
thousand
miles
away
he
came
upon
many
trails
in
the
snow
that
day
and
sniffed
the
scents
left
by
the
hoofs
of
moose
and
caribou
and
the
feet
of
a
lynx
he
followed
a
fox
and
the
trail
led
him
to
a
place
shut
in
by
tall
spruce
where
the
snow
was
beaten
down
and
reddened
with
blood
there
was
an
owl
head
feathers
wings
and
entrails
lying
here
and
he
knew
that
there
were
other
hunters
abroad
besides
himself
toward
evening
he
came
upon
tracks
in
the
snow
that
were
very
much
like
his
own
they
were
quite
fresh
and
there
was
a
warm
scent
about
them
that
made
him
whine
and
filled
him
again
with
that
desire
to
fall
back
upon
his
haunches
and
send
forth
the
this
desire
grew
stronger
in
him
as
the
shadows
of
night
deepened
in
the
forest
he
had
traveled
all
day
but
he
was
not
tired
there
was
something
about
night
now
that
there
were
no
men
near
that
exhilarated
him
strangely
the
wolf
blood
in
him
ran
swifter
and
swifter
it
was
clear
the
sky
was
filled
with
stars
the
moon
rose
and
at
last
he
settled
back
in
the
snow
and
turned
his
head
straight
up
to
the
and
the
wolf
came
out
of
him
in
a
long
mournful
cry
which
quivered
through
the
still
night
for
miles
for
a
long
time
he
sat
and
listened
after
that
howl
he
had
found
voice
a
voice
with
a
strange
new
note
in
it
and
it
gave
him
still
greater
confidence
he
had
expected
an
answer
but
none
came
he
had
traveled
in
the
face
of
the
wind
and
as
he
howled
a
bull
moose
crashed
through
the
scrub
timber
ahead
of
him
his
horns
rattling
against
the
trees
like
the
tattoo
of
a
clear
birch
club
as
he
put
distance
between
himself
and
that
cry
twice
kazan
howled
before
he
went
on
and
he
found
joy
in
the
practise
of
that
new
note
he
came
then
to
the
foot
of
a
rough
ridge
and
turned
up
out
of
the
swamp
to
the
top
of
it
the
stars
and
the
moon
were
nearer
to
him
there
and
on
the
other
side
of
the
ridge
he
looked
down
upon
a
great
sweeping
plain
with
a
frozen
lake
glistening
in
the
moonlight
and
a
white
river
leading
from
it
off
into
timber
that
was
neither
so
thick
nor
so
black
as
that
in
the
swamp
and
then
every
muscle
in
his
body
grew
tense
and
his
blood
leaped
from
far
off
in
the
plain
there
came
a
cry
it
was
cry
the
his
jaws
snapped
his
white
fangs
gleamed
and
he
growled
deep
in
his
throat
he
wanted
to
reply
but
some
strange
instinct
urged
him
not
to
that
instinct
of
the
wild
was
already
becoming
master
of
him
in
the
air
in
the
whispering
of
the
in
the
moon
and
the
stars
themselves
there
breathed
a
spirit
which
told
him
that
what
he
had
heard
was
the
but
that
it
was
not
the
wolf
the
other
came
an
hour
later
clear
and
distinct
that
same
wailing
howl
at
the
beginning
but
ending
in
a
staccato
of
quick
sharp
yelps
that
stirred
his
blood
at
once
into
a
fiery
excitement
that
it
had
never
known
before
the
same
instinct
told
him
that
this
was
the
call
the
it
urged
him
to
come
quickly
a
few
moments
later
it
came
again
and
this
time
there
was
a
reply
from
close
down
along
the
foot
of
the
ridge
and
another
from
so
far
away
that
kazan
could
scarcely
hear
it
the
was
gathering
for
the
night
chase
but
kazan
sat
quiet
and
trembling
he
was
not
afraid
but
he
was
not
ready
to
go
the
ridge
seemed
to
split
the
world
for
him
down
there
it
was
new
and
strange
and
without
men
from
the
other
side
something
seemed
pulling
him
back
and
suddenly
he
turned
his
head
and
gazed
back
through
the
moonlit
space
behind
him
and
whined
it
was
the
now
the
woman
was
back
there
he
could
hear
her
voice
he
could
feel
the
touch
of
her
soft
hand
he
could
see
the
laughter
in
her
face
and
eyes
the
laughter
that
had
made
him
warm
and
happy
she
was
calling
to
him
through
the
forests
and
he
was
torn
between
desire
to
answer
that
call
and
desire
to
go
down
into
the
plain
for
he
could
also
see
many
men
waiting
for
him
with
clubs
and
he
could
hear
the
cracking
of
whips
and
feel
the
sting
of
their
lashes
for
a
long
time
he
remained
on
the
top
of
the
ridge
that
divided
his
world
and
then
at
last
he
turned
and
went
down
into
the
plain
all
that
night
he
kept
close
to
the
but
never
quite
approached
it
this
was
fortunate
for
him
he
still
bore
the
scent
of
traces
and
of
man
the
pack
would
have
torn
him
into
pieces
the
first
instinct
of
the
wild
is
that
of
it
may
have
been
this
a
whisper
back
through
the
years
of
savage
forebears
that
made
kazan
roll
in
the
snow
now
and
then
where
the
feet
of
the
pack
had
trod
the
thickest
that
night
the
pack
killed
a
caribou
on
the
edge
of
the
lake
and
feasted
until
nearly
dawn
kazan
hung
in
the
face
of
the
wind
the
smell
of
blood
and
of
warm
flesh
tickled
his
nostrils
and
his
sharp
ears
could
catch
the
cracking
of
bones
but
the
instinct
was
stronger
than
the
temptation
not
until
broad
day
when
the
pack
had
scattered
far
and
wide
over
the
plain
did
he
go
boldly
to
the
scene
of
the
kill
he
found
nothing
but
an
area
of
snow
covered
with
bones
entrails
and
torn
bits
of
tough
hide
but
it
was
enough
and
he
rolled
in
it
and
buried
his
nose
in
what
was
left
and
remained
all
that
day
close
to
it
saturating
himself
with
the
scent
of
it
that
night
when
the
moon
and
the
stars
came
out
again
he
sat
back
with
fear
and
hesitation
no
longer
in
him
and
announced
himself
to
his
new
comrades
of
the
great
plain
the
pack
hunted
again
that
night
or
else
it
was
a
new
pack
that
started
miles
to
the
south
and
came
up
with
a
doe
caribou
to
the
big
frozen
lake
the
night
was
almost
as
clear
as
day
and
from
the
edge
of
the
forest
kazan
first
saw
the
caribou
run
out
on
the
lake
a
third
of
a
mile
away
the
pack
was
about
a
dozen
strong
and
had
already
split
into
the
fatal
horseshoe
formation
the
two
leaders
running
almost
abreast
of
the
kill
and
slowly
closing
in
with
a
sharp
yelp
kazan
darted
out
into
the
moonlight
he
was
directly
in
the
path
of
the
fleeing
doe
and
bore
down
upon
her
with
lightning
speed
two
hundred
yards
away
the
doe
saw
him
and
swerved
to
the
right
and
the
leader
on
that
side
met
her
with
open
jaws
kazan
was
in
with
the
second
leader
and
leaped
at
the
doe
soft
throat
in
a
snarling
mass
the
pack
closed
in
from
behind
and
the
doe
went
down
with
kazan
half
under
her
body
his
fangs
sunk
deep
in
her
jugular
she
lay
heavily
on
him
but
he
did
not
lose
his
hold
it
was
his
first
big
kill
his
blood
ran
like
fire
he
snarled
between
his
clamped
teeth
not
until
the
last
quiver
had
left
the
body
over
him
did
he
pull
himself
out
from
under
her
chest
and
forelegs
he
had
killed
a
rabbit
that
day
and
was
not
hungry
so
he
sat
back
in
the
snow
and
waited
while
the
ravenous
pack
tore
at
the
dead
doe
after
a
little
he
came
nearer
nosed
in
between
two
of
them
and
was
nipped
for
his
intrusion
as
kazan
drew
back
still
hesitating
to
mix
with
his
wild
brothers
a
big
gray
form
leaped
out
of
the
pack
and
drove
straight
for
his
throat
he
had
just
time
to
throw
his
shoulder
to
the
attack
and
for
a
moment
the
two
rolled
over
and
over
in
the
snow
they
were
up
before
the
excitement
of
sudden
battle
had
drawn
the
pack
from
the
feast
slowly
they
circled
about
each
other
their
white
fangs
bare
their
yellowish
backs
bristling
like
brushes
the
fatal
ring
of
wolves
drew
about
the
fighters
it
was
not
new
to
kazan
a
dozen
times
he
had
sat
in
rings
like
this
waiting
for
the
final
moment
more
than
once
he
had
fought
for
his
life
within
the
circle
it
was
the
way
of
fighting
unless
man
interrupted
with
a
club
or
a
whip
it
always
ended
in
death
only
one
fighter
could
come
out
alive
sometimes
both
died
and
there
was
no
man
here
only
that
fatal
cordon
of
waiting
demons
ready
to
leap
upon
and
tear
to
pieces
the
first
of
the
fighters
who
was
thrown
upon
his
side
or
back
kazan
was
a
stranger
but
he
did
not
fear
those
that
hemmed
him
in
the
one
great
law
of
the
pack
would
compel
them
to
be
fair
he
kept
his
eyes
only
on
the
big
gray
leader
who
had
challenged
him
shoulder
to
shoulder
they
continued
to
circle
where
a
few
moments
before
there
had
been
the
snapping
of
jaws
and
the
rending
of
flesh
there
was
now
silence
and
mongrel
dogs
from
the
south
would
have
snarled
and
growled
but
kazan
and
the
wolf
were
still
their
ears
laid
forward
instead
of
back
their
tails
free
and
bushy
suddenly
the
wolf
struck
in
with
the
swiftness
of
lightning
and
his
jaws
came
together
with
the
sharpness
of
steel
striking
steel
they
missed
by
an
inch
in
that
same
instant
kazan
darted
in
to
the
side
and
like
knives
his
teeth
gashed
the
wolf
flank
they
circled
again
their
eyes
growing
redder
their
lips
drawn
back
until
they
seemed
to
have
disappeared
and
then
kazan
leaped
for
that
at
the
throat
and
missed
it
was
only
by
an
inch
again
and
the
wolf
came
back
as
he
had
done
and
laid
open
kazan
flank
so
that
the
blood
ran
down
his
leg
and
reddened
the
snow
the
burn
of
that
told
kazan
that
his
enemy
was
old
in
the
game
of
fighting
he
crouched
low
his
head
straight
out
and
his
throat
close
to
the
snow
it
was
a
trick
kazan
had
learned
in
puppyhood
to
shield
his
throat
and
wait
twice
the
wolf
circled
about
him
and
kazan
pivoted
slowly
his
eyes
half
closed
a
second
time
the
wolf
leaped
and
kazan
threw
up
his
terrible
jaws
sure
of
that
fatal
grip
just
in
front
of
the
forelegs
his
teeth
snapped
on
empty
air
with
the
nimbleness
of
a
cat
the
wolf
had
gone
completely
over
his
back
the
trick
had
failed
and
with
a
rumble
of
the
in
his
throat
kazan
reached
the
wolf
in
a
single
bound
they
met
breast
to
breast
their
fangs
clashed
and
with
the
whole
weight
of
his
body
kazan
flung
himself
against
the
wolf
shoulders
cleared
his
jaws
and
struck
again
for
the
throat
hold
it
was
another
miss
by
a
hair
breadth
and
before
he
could
recover
the
wolf
teeth
were
buried
in
the
back
of
his
neck
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
kazan
felt
the
terror
and
the
pain
of
the
and
with
a
mighty
effort
he
flung
his
head
a
little
forward
and
snapped
blindly
his
powerful
jaws
closed
on
the
wolf
foreleg
close
to
the
body
there
was
a
cracking
of
bone
and
a
crunching
of
flesh
and
the
circle
of
waiting
wolves
grew
tense
and
alert
one
or
the
other
of
the
fighters
was
sure
to
go
down
before
the
holds
were
broken
and
they
but
awaited
that
fatal
fall
as
a
signal
to
leap
in
to
the
death
only
the
thickness
of
hair
and
hide
on
the
back
of
kazan
neck
and
the
toughness
of
his
muscles
saved
him
from
that
terrible
fate
of
the
vanquished
the
wolf
teeth
sank
deep
but
not
deep
enough
to
reach
the
vital
spot
and
suddenly
kazan
put
every
ounce
of
strength
in
his
limbs
to
the
effort
and
flung
himself
up
bodily
from
under
his
antagonist
the
grip
on
his
neck
relaxed
and
with
another
rearing
leap
he
tore
himself
free
as
swift
as
a
he
whirled
on
the
leader
of
the
pack
and
with
the
full
rush
and
weight
of
his
shoulders
struck
him
fairly
in
the
side
more
deadly
than
the
had
kazan
sometimes
found
the
lunge
when
delivered
at
the
right
moment
it
was
deadly
now
the
big
gray
wolf
lost
his
feet
rolled
upon
his
back
for
an
instant
and
the
pack
rushed
in
eager
to
rend
the
last
of
life
from
the
leader
whose
power
had
ceased
to
exist
from
out
of
that
gray
snarling
mass
kazan
drew
back
panting
and
bleeding
he
was
weak
there
was
a
curious
sickness
in
his
head
he
wanted
to
lie
down
in
the
snow
but
the
old
and
infallible
instinct
warned
him
not
to
betray
that
weakness
from
out
of
the
pack
a
slim
lithe
gray
came
up
to
him
and
lay
down
in
the
snow
before
him
and
then
rose
swiftly
and
sniffed
at
his
wounds
she
was
young
and
strong
and
beautiful
but
kazan
did
not
look
at
her
where
the
fight
had
been
he
was
looking
at
what
little
remained
of
the
old
leader
the
pack
had
returned
to
the
feast
he
heard
again
the
cracking
of
bones
and
the
rending
of
flesh
and
something
told
him
that
hereafter
all
the
wilderness
would
hear
and
recognize
his
voice
and
that
when
he
sat
back
on
his
haunches
and
called
to
the
moon
and
the
stars
those
hunters
of
the
big
plain
would
respond
to
it
he
circled
twice
about
the
caribou
and
the
pack
and
then
trotted
off
to
the
edge
of
the
black
spruce
forest
when
he
reached
the
shadows
he
looked
back
gray
wolf
was
following
him
she
was
only
a
few
yards
behind
and
now
she
came
up
to
him
a
little
timidly
and
she
too
looked
back
to
the
dark
blotch
of
life
out
on
the
lake
and
as
she
stood
there
close
beside
him
kazan
sniffed
at
something
in
the
air
that
was
not
the
scent
of
blood
nor
the
perfume
of
the
balsam
and
spruce
it
was
a
thing
that
seemed
to
come
to
him
from
the
clear
stars
the
cloudless
moon
the
strange
and
beautiful
quiet
of
the
night
itself
and
its
presence
seemed
to
be
a
part
of
gray
wolf
he
looked
at
her
and
he
found
gray
wolf
eyes
alert
and
questioning
she
was
young
so
young
that
she
seemed
scarcely
to
have
passed
out
of
puppyhood
her
body
was
strong
and
slim
and
beautifully
shaped
in
the
moonlight
the
hair
under
her
throat
and
along
her
back
shone
sleek
and
soft
she
whined
at
the
red
staring
light
in
kazan
eyes
and
it
was
not
a
puppy
whimper
kazan
moved
toward
her
and
stood
with
his
head
over
her
back
facing
the
pack
he
felt
her
trembling
against
his
chest
he
looked
at
the
moon
and
the
stars
again
the
mystery
of
gray
wolf
and
of
the
night
throbbing
in
his
blood
not
much
of
his
life
had
been
spent
at
the
posts
most
of
it
had
been
on
the
trail
in
the
traces
and
the
spirit
of
the
mating
season
had
only
stirred
him
from
afar
but
it
was
very
near
now
gray
wolf
lifted
her
head
her
soft
muzzle
touched
the
wound
on
his
neck
and
in
the
gentleness
of
that
touch
in
the
low
sound
in
her
throat
kazan
felt
and
heard
again
that
wonderful
something
that
had
come
with
the
caress
of
the
woman
hand
and
the
sound
of
her
voice
he
turned
whining
his
back
bristling
his
head
high
and
defiant
of
the
wilderness
which
he
faced
gray
wolf
trotted
close
at
his
side
as
they
entered
into
the
gloom
of
the
forest
chapter
v
the
fight
in
the
snow
they
found
shelter
that
night
under
thick
balsam
and
when
they
lay
down
on
the
soft
carpet
of
needles
which
the
snow
had
not
covered
gray
wolf
snuggled
her
warm
body
close
to
kazan
and
licked
his
wounds
the
day
broke
with
a
velvety
fall
of
snow
so
white
and
thick
that
they
could
not
see
a
dozen
leaps
ahead
of
them
in
the
open
it
was
quite
warm
and
so
still
that
the
whole
world
seemed
filled
with
only
the
flutter
and
whisper
of
the
snowflakes
through
this
day
kazan
and
gray
wolf
traveled
side
by
side
time
and
again
he
turned
his
head
back
to
the
ridge
over
which
he
had
come
and
gray
wolf
could
not
understand
the
strange
note
that
trembled
in
his
throat
in
the
afternoon
they
returned
to
what
was
left
of
the
caribou
doe
on
the
lake
in
the
edge
of
the
forest
gray
wolf
hung
back
she
did
not
yet
know
the
meaning
of
deadfalls
and
traps
but
the
instinct
of
numberless
generations
was
in
her
veins
and
it
told
her
there
was
danger
in
visiting
a
second
time
a
thing
that
had
grown
cold
in
death
kazan
had
seen
masters
work
about
carcasses
that
the
wolves
had
left
he
had
seen
them
conceal
traps
cleverly
and
roll
little
capsules
of
strychnine
in
the
fat
of
the
entrails
and
once
he
had
put
a
foreleg
in
a
trap
and
had
experienced
its
sting
and
pain
and
deadly
grip
but
he
did
not
have
gray
wolf
fear
he
urged
her
to
accompany
him
to
the
white
hummocks
on
the
ice
and
at
last
she
went
with
him
and
sank
back
restlessly
on
her
haunches
while
he
dug
out
the
bones
and
pieces
of
flesh
that
the
snow
had
kept
from
freezing
but
she
would
not
eat
and
at
last
kazan
went
and
sat
on
his
haunches
at
her
side
and
with
her
looked
at
what
he
had
dug
out
from
under
the
snow
he
sniffed
the
air
he
could
not
smell
danger
but
gray
wolf
told
him
that
it
might
be
there
she
told
him
many
other
things
in
the
days
and
nights
that
followed
the
third
night
kazan
himself
gathered
the
and
led
in
the
chase
three
times
that
month
before
the
moon
left
the
skies
he
led
the
chase
and
each
time
there
was
a
kill
but
as
the
snows
began
to
grow
softer
under
his
feet
he
found
a
greater
and
greater
companionship
in
gray
wolf
and
they
hunted
alone
living
on
the
big
white
rabbits
in
all
the
world
he
had
loved
but
two
things
the
girl
with
the
shining
hair
and
the
hands
that
had
caressed
him
and
gray
wolf
he
did
not
leave
the
big
plain
and
often
he
took
his
mate
to
the
top
of
the
ridge
and
he
would
try
to
tell
her
what
he
had
left
back
there
with
the
dark
nights
the
call
of
the
woman
became
so
strong
upon
him
that
he
was
filled
with
a
longing
to
go
back
and
take
gray
wolf
with
him
something
happened
very
soon
after
that
they
were
crossing
the
open
plain
one
day
when
up
on
the
face
of
the
ridge
kazan
saw
something
that
made
his
heart
stand
still
a
man
with
a
and
team
was
coming
down
into
their
world
the
wind
had
not
warned
them
and
suddenly
kazan
saw
something
glisten
in
the
man
hands
he
knew
what
it
was
it
was
the
thing
that
spat
fire
and
thunder
and
killed
he
gave
his
warning
to
gray
wolf
and
they
were
off
like
the
wind
side
by
side
and
then
came
the
and
kazan
hatred
of
men
burst
forth
in
a
snarl
as
he
leaped
there
was
a
queer
humming
over
their
heads
the
sound
from
behind
came
again
and
this
time
gray
wolf
gave
a
yelp
of
pain
and
rolled
over
and
over
in
the
snow
she
was
on
her
feet
again
in
an
instant
and
kazan
dropped
behind
her
and
ran
there
until
they
reached
the
shelter
of
the
timber
gray
wolf
lay
down
and
began
licking
the
wound
in
her
shoulder
kazan
faced
the
ridge
the
man
was
taking
up
their
trail
he
stopped
where
gray
wolf
had
fallen
and
examined
the
snow
then
he
came
on
kazan
urged
gray
wolf
to
her
feet
and
they
made
for
the
thick
swamp
close
to
the
lake
all
that
day
they
kept
in
the
face
of
the
wind
and
when
gray
wolf
lay
down
kazan
stole
back
over
their
trail
watching
and
sniffing
the
air
for
days
after
that
gray
wolf
ran
lame
and
when
once
they
came
upon
the
remains
of
an
old
camp
kazan
teeth
were
bared
in
snarling
hatred
of
the
that
had
been
left
behind
growing
in
him
there
was
a
desire
for
vengeance
vengeance
for
his
own
hurts
and
for
gray
wolf
he
tried
to
nose
out
the
under
the
cover
of
fresh
snow
and
gray
wolf
circled
around
him
anxiously
and
tried
to
lure
him
deeper
into
the
forest
at
last
he
followed
her
sullenly
there
was
a
savage
redness
in
his
eyes
three
days
later
the
new
moon
came
and
on
the
fifth
night
kazan
struck
a
trail
it
was
fresh
so
fresh
that
he
stopped
as
suddenly
as
though
struck
by
a
bullet
when
he
ran
upon
it
and
stood
with
every
muscle
in
his
body
quivering
and
his
hair
on
end
it
was
a
there
were
the
marks
of
the
sledge
the
dogs
feet
and
the
of
his
enemy
then
he
threw
up
his
head
to
the
stars
and
from
his
throat
there
rolled
out
over
the
wide
plains
the
the
wild
and
savage
call
for
the
pack
never
had
he
put
the
savagery
in
it
that
was
there
again
and
again
he
sent
forth
that
call
and
then
there
came
an
answer
and
another
and
still
another
until
gray
wolf
herself
sat
back
on
her
haunches
and
added
her
voice
to
kazan
and
far
out
on
the
plain
a
white
and
man
halted
his
exhausted
dogs
to
listen
while
a
voice
said
faintly
from
the
sledge
the
wolves
father
are
they
coming
after
us
the
man
was
silent
he
was
not
young
the
moon
shone
in
his
long
white
beard
and
added
grotesquely
to
the
height
of
his
tall
gaunt
figure
a
girl
had
raised
her
head
from
a
bearskin
pillow
on
the
sleigh
her
dark
eyes
were
filled
beautifully
with
the
starlight
she
was
pale
her
hair
fell
in
a
thick
shining
braid
over
her
shoulder
and
she
was
hugging
something
tightly
to
her
breast
they
on
the
trail
of
something
probably
a
deer
said
the
man
looking
at
the
breech
of
his
rifle
do
worry
jo
we
stop
at
the
next
bit
of
scrub
and
see
if
we
ca
find
enough
dry
stuff
for
a
boys
koosh
koosh
and
he
snapped
his
whip
over
the
backs
of
his
team
from
the
bundle
at
the
girl
breast
there
came
a
small
wailing
cry
and
far
back
in
the
plain
there
answered
it
the
scattered
voice
of
the
pack
at
last
kazan
was
on
the
trail
of
vengeance
he
ran
slowly
at
first
with
gray
wolf
close
beside
him
pausing
every
three
or
four
hundred
yards
to
send
forth
the
cry
a
gray
leaping
form
joined
them
from
behind
another
followed
two
came
in
from
the
side
and
solitary
howl
gave
place
to
the
wild
tongue
of
the
pack
numbers
grew
and
with
increasing
number
the
pace
became
swifter
four
six
seven
ten
fourteen
by
the
time
the
more
open
and
part
of
the
plain
was
reached
it
was
a
strong
pack
filled
with
old
and
fearless
hunters
gray
wolf
was
the
youngest
and
she
kept
close
to
kazan
shoulders
she
could
see
nothing
of
his
eyes
and
dripping
jaws
and
would
not
have
understood
if
she
had
seen
but
she
could
and
she
was
thrilled
by
the
spirit
of
that
strange
and
mysterious
savagery
that
had
made
kazan
forget
all
things
but
hurt
and
death
the
pack
made
no
sound
there
was
only
the
panting
of
breath
and
the
soft
fall
of
many
feet
they
ran
swiftly
and
close
and
always
kazan
was
a
leap
ahead
with
gray
wolf
nosing
his
shoulder
never
had
he
wanted
to
kill
as
he
felt
the
desire
in
him
to
kill
now
for
the
first
time
he
had
no
fear
of
man
no
fear
of
the
club
of
the
whip
or
of
the
thing
that
blazed
forth
fire
and
death
he
ran
more
swiftly
in
order
to
overtake
them
and
give
them
battle
sooner
all
of
the
madness
of
four
years
of
slavery
and
abuse
at
the
hands
of
men
broke
loose
in
thin
red
streams
of
fire
in
his
veins
and
when
at
last
he
saw
a
moving
blotch
far
out
on
the
plain
ahead
of
him
the
cry
that
came
out
of
his
throat
was
one
that
gray
wolf
did
not
understand
three
hundred
yards
beyond
that
moving
blotch
was
the
thin
line
of
timber
and
kazan
and
his
followers
bore
down
swiftly
to
the
timber
they
were
almost
upon
it
and
suddenly
it
stopped
and
became
a
black
and
motionless
shadow
on
the
snow
from
out
of
it
there
leaped
that
lightning
tongue
of
flame
that
kazan
had
always
dreaded
and
he
heard
the
hissing
song
of
the
over
his
head
he
did
not
mind
it
now
he
yelped
sharply
and
the
wolves
raced
in
until
four
of
them
were
with
him
a
second
flash
and
the
drove
from
breast
to
tail
of
a
huge
gray
fighter
close
to
gray
wolf
a
third
a
fourth
a
fifth
spurt
of
that
fire
from
the
black
shadow
and
kazan
himself
felt
a
sudden
swift
passing
of
a
thing
along
his
shoulder
where
the
man
last
bullet
shaved
off
the
hair
and
stung
his
flesh
three
of
the
pack
had
gone
down
under
the
fire
of
the
rifle
and
half
of
the
others
were
swinging
to
the
right
and
the
left
but
kazan
drove
straight
ahead
faithfully
gray
wolf
followed
him
the
had
been
freed
from
their
traces
and
before
he
could
reach
the
man
whom
he
saw
with
his
rifle
held
like
a
club
in
his
hands
kazan
was
met
by
the
fighting
mass
of
them
he
fought
like
a
fiend
and
there
was
the
strength
and
the
fierceness
of
two
mates
in
the
mad
gnashing
of
gray
wolf
fangs
two
of
the
wolves
rushed
in
and
kazan
heard
the
terrific
thud
of
the
rifle
to
him
it
was
the
he
wanted
to
reach
it
he
wanted
to
reach
the
man
who
held
it
and
he
freed
himself
from
the
fighting
mass
of
the
dogs
and
sprang
to
the
sledge
for
the
first
time
he
saw
that
there
was
something
human
on
the
sledge
and
in
an
instant
he
was
upon
it
he
buried
his
jaws
deep
they
sank
in
something
soft
and
hairy
and
he
opened
them
for
another
lunge
and
then
he
heard
the
voice
it
was
every
muscle
in
his
body
stood
still
he
became
suddenly
like
flesh
turned
to
lifeless
stone
the
bear
rug
was
thrown
back
and
what
had
been
hidden
under
it
he
saw
clearly
now
in
the
light
of
the
moon
and
the
stars
in
him
instinct
worked
more
swiftly
than
human
brain
could
have
given
birth
to
reason
it
was
not
but
the
voice
was
the
same
and
the
white
girlish
face
so
close
to
his
own
eyes
held
in
it
that
same
mystery
that
he
had
learned
to
love
and
he
saw
now
that
which
she
was
clutching
to
her
breast
and
there
came
from
it
a
strange
thrilling
cry
and
he
knew
that
here
on
the
sledge
he
had
found
not
enmity
and
death
but
that
from
which
he
had
been
driven
away
in
the
other
world
beyond
the
ridge
in
a
flash
he
turned
he
snapped
at
gray
wolf
flank
and
she
dropped
away
with
a
startled
yelp
it
had
all
happened
in
a
moment
but
the
man
was
almost
down
kazan
leaped
under
his
clubbed
rifle
and
drove
into
the
face
of
what
was
left
of
the
pack
his
fangs
cut
like
knives
if
he
had
fought
like
a
demon
against
the
dogs
he
fought
like
ten
demons
now
and
the
man
bleeding
and
ready
to
fall
staggered
back
to
the
sledge
marveling
at
what
was
happening
for
in
gray
wolf
there
was
now
the
instinct
of
matehood
and
seeing
kazan
tearing
and
righting
the
pack
she
joined
him
in
the
struggle
which
she
could
not
understand
when
it
was
over
kazan
and
gray
wolf
were
alone
out
on
the
plain
the
pack
had
slunk
away
into
the
night
and
the
same
moon
and
stars
that
had
given
to
kazan
the
first
knowledge
of
his
birthright
told
him
now
that
no
longer
would
those
wild
brothers
of
the
plains
respond
to
his
call
when
he
howled
into
the
sky
he
was
hurt
and
gray
wolf
was
hurt
but
not
so
badly
as
kazan
he
was
torn
and
bleeding
one
of
his
legs
was
terribly
bitten
after
a
time
he
saw
a
fire
in
the
edge
of
the
forest
the
old
call
was
strong
upon
him
he
wanted
to
crawl
in
to
it
and
feel
the
girl
hand
on
his
head
as
he
had
felt
that
other
hand
in
the
world
beyond
the
ridge
he
would
have
gone
and
would
have
urged
gray
wolf
to
go
with
him
but
the
man
was
there
he
whined
and
gray
wolf
thrust
her
warm
muzzle
against
his
neck
something
told
them
both
that
they
were
outcasts
that
the
plains
and
the
moon
and
the
stars
were
against
them
now
and
they
slunk
into
the
shelter
and
the
gloom
of
the
forest
kazan
could
not
go
far
he
could
still
smell
the
camp
when
he
lay
down
gray
wolf
snuggled
close
to
him
gently
she
soothed
with
her
soft
tongue
kazan
bleeding
wounds
and
kazan
lifting
his
head
whined
softly
to
the
stars

joan
on
the
edge
of
the
cedar
and
spruce
forest
old
pierre
radisson
built
the
fire
he
was
bleeding
from
a
dozen
wounds
where
the
fangs
of
the
wolves
had
reached
to
his
flesh
and
he
felt
in
his
breast
that
old
and
terrible
pain
of
which
no
one
knew
the
meaning
but
himself
he
dragged
in
log
after
log
piled
them
on
the
fire
until
the
flames
leaped

to
the
crisping
needles
of
the
limbs

heaped
a
supply
close
at

joan
watched
him
still
and
fearful
still
trembling
she
was
holding
her
baby
close
to
her
breast
her
long
heavy
hair
smothered
her
shoulders
and
arms
in
a
dark
lustrous
veil
that
glistened
and
rippled
in
the
firelight
when
she
moved
her
young
face

scarcely
a
woman
though
she
was
a
mother
she
looked
like

child
old
pierre
laughed
as
he
threw
down
the
last
armful
of
fuel
and
stood
breathing
hard
it
was
close
he
panted
through
his
white
beard
we
were
nearer
to
death
out
there
on
the
plain
than
we
will
ever
be
again
i
hope
but
we
are
comfortable
now
and
warm
eh
you
are
no
longer
afraid
he
sat
down
beside
his
daughter
and
gently
pulled
back
the
soft
fur
that
enveloped
the
bundle
she
held
in
her
arms
he
could
see
one
pink
cheek
of

the
eyes
of
joan
the

were
like
stars
it
was
the
baby
who
saved
us
she
whispered
the
dogs
were
being
torn
to
pieces
by
the
wolves
and
i
saw
them
leaping
upon
you
when
one
of
them
sprang
to
the
sledge
at
first
i
thought
it
was
one
of
the
dogs
but
it
was
a
wolf
he
tore
once
at
us
and
the
bearskin
saved
us
he
was
almost
at
my
throat
when
baby
cried
and
then
he
stood
there
his
red
eyes
a
foot
from
us
and
i
could
have
sworn
again
that
he
was
a
dog
in
an
instant
he
turned
and
was
fighting
the
wolves
i
saw
him
leap
upon
one
that
was
almost
at
your
throat

bundle
and
stood
up
straight
and
tall
and
slim
in
the
firelight
he
fought
for
us
and
he
was
terribly
hurt
she
said
i
saw
him
drag
himself
away
father
if
he
is
out
there
dying
pierre
radisson
stood
up
he
coughed
in
a
shuddering
way
trying
to
stifle
the
sound
under
his
beard
the
fleck
of
crimson
that
came
to
his
lips
with
the
cough
joan
did
not
see
she
had
seen
nothing
of
it
during
the
six
days
they
had
been
traveling
up
from
the
edge
of
civilization
because
of
that
cough
and
the
stain
that
came
with
it
pierre
had
made
more
than
ordinary
haste
i
have
been
thinking
of
that
he
said
he
was
badly
hurt
and
i
do
not
think
he
went
far
here
take
little
joan
and
sit
close
to
the
fire
until
i
come
back
the
moon
and
the
stars
were
brilliant
in
the
sky
when
he
went
out
in
the
plain
a
short
distance
from
the
edge
of
the
he
stood
for
a
moment
upon
the
spot
where
the
wolves
had
overtaken
them
an
hour
before
not
one
of
his
four
dogs
had
lived
the
snow
was
red
with
their
blood
and
their
bodies
lay
stiff
where
they
had
fallen
under
the
pack
pierre
shuddered
as
he
looked
at
them
if
the
wolves
had
not
turned
their
first
mad
attack
upon
the
dogs
what
would
have
become
of
himself
joan
and
the
baby
he
turned
away
with
another
of
those
hollow
coughs
that
brought
the
blood
to
his
lips
a
few
yards
to
one
side
he
found
in
the
snow
the
trail
of
the
strange
dog
that
had
come
with
the
wolves
and
had
turned
against
them
in
that
moment
when
all
seemed
lost
it
was
not
a
clean
running
trail
it
was
more
of
a
furrow
in
the
snow
and
pierre
radisson
followed
it
expecting
to
find
the
dog
dead
at
the
end
of
it
in
the
sheltered
spot
to
which
he
had
dragged
himself
in
the
edge
of
the
forest
kazan
lay
for
a
long
time
after
the
fight
alert
and
watchful
he
felt
no
very
great
pain
but
he
had
lost
the
power
to
stand
upon
his
legs
his
flanks
seemed
paralyzed
gray
wolf
crouched
close
at
his
side
sniffing
the
air
they
could
smell
the
camp
and
kazan
could
detect
the
two
things
that
were
there
and
he
knew
that
the
girl
was
there
where
he
could
see
the
glow
of
the
firelight
through
the
spruce
and
the
cedars
he
wanted
to
go
to
her
he
wanted
to
drag
himself
close
in
to
the
fire
and
take
gray
wolf
with
him
and
listen
to
her
voice
and
feel
the
touch
of
her
hand
but
the
man
was
there
and
to
him
man
had
always
meant
the
club
the
whip
pain
death
gray
wolf
crouched
close
to
his
side
and
whined
softly
as
she
urged
kazan
to
flee
deeper
with
her
into
the
forest
at
last
she
understood
that
he
could
not
move
and
she
ran
nervously
out
into
the
plain
and
back
again
until
her
footprints
were
thick
in
the
trail
she
made
the
instincts
of
matehood
were
strong
in
her
it
was
she
who
first
saw
pierre
radisson
coming
over
their
trail
and
she
ran
swiftly
back
to
kazan
and
gave
the
warning
then
kazan
caught
the
scent
and
he
saw
the
shadowy
figure
coming
through
the
starlight
he
tried
to
drag
himself
back
but
he
could
move
only
by
inches
the
man
came
rapidly
nearer
kazan
caught
the
glisten
of
the
rifle
in
his
hand
he
heard
his
hollow
cough
and
the
tread
of
his
feet
in
the
snow
gray
wolf
crouched
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
him
trembling
and
showing
her
teeth
when
pierre
had
approached
within
fifty
feet
of
them
she
slunk
back
into
the
deeper
shadows
of
the
spruce
kazan
fangs
were
bared
menacingly
when
pierre
stopped
and
looked
down
at
him
with
an
effort
he
dragged
himself
to
his
feet
but
fell
back
into
the
snow
again
the
man
leaned
his
rifle
against
a
sapling
and
bent
over
him
fearlessly
with
a
fierce
growl
kazan
snapped
at
his
extended
hands
to
his
surprise
the
man
did
not
pick
up
a
stick
or
a
club
he
held
out
his
hand
again
cautiously
and
spoke
in
a
voice
new
to
kazan
the
dog
snapped
again
and
growled
the
man
persisted
talking
to
him
all
the
time
and
once
his
mittened
hand
touched
kazan
head
and
escaped
before
the
jaws
could
reach
it
again
and
again
the
man
reached
out
his
hand
and
three
times
kazan
felt
the
touch
of
it
and
there
was
neither
threat
nor
hurt
in
it
at
last
pierre
turned
away
and
went
back
over
the
trail
when
he
was
out
of
sight
and
hearing
kazan
whined
and
the
crest
along
his
spine
flattened
he
looked
wistfully
toward
the
glow
of
the
fire
the
man
had
not
hurt
him
and
the
of
him
that
was
dog
wanted
to
follow
gray
wolf
came
back
and
stood
with
stiffly
planted
forefeet
at
his
side
she
had
never
been
this
near
to
man
before
except
when
the
pack
had
overtaken
the
sledge
out
on
the
plain
she
could
not
understand
every
instinct
that
was
in
her
warned
her
that
he
was
the
most
dangerous
of
all
things
more
to
be
feared
than
the
strongest
beasts
the
storms
the
floods
cold
and
starvation
and
yet
this
man
had
not
harmed
her
mate
she
sniffed
at
kazan
back
and
head
where
the
mittened
hand
had
touched
then
she
trotted
back
into
the
darkness
again
for
beyond
the
edge
of
the
forest
she
once
more
saw
moving
life
the
man
was
returning
and
with
him
was
the
girl
her
voice
was
soft
and
sweet
and
there
was
about
her
the
breath
and
sweetness
of
woman
the
man
stood
prepared
but
not
threatening
be
careful
joan
he
warned
she
dropped
on
her
knees
in
the
snow
just
out
of
reach
come
boy
come
she
said
gently
she
held
out
her
hand
muscles
twitched
he
moved
an
inch
two
inches
toward
her
there
was
the
old
light
in
her
eyes
and
face
now
the
love
and
gentleness
he
had
known
once
before
when
another
woman
with
shining
hair
and
eyes
had
come
into
his
life
come
she
whispered
as
she
saw
him
move
and
she
bent
a
little
reached
a
little
farther
with
her
hand
and
at
last
touched
his
head
pierre
knelt
beside
her
he
was
proffering
something
and
kazan
smelled
meat
but
it
was
the
girl
hand
that
made
him
tremble
and
shiver
and
when
she
drew
back
urging
him
to
follow
her
he
dragged
himself
painfully
a
foot
or
two
through
the
snow
not
until
then
did
the
girl
see
his
mangled
leg
in
an
instant
she
had
forgotten
all
caution
and
was
down
close
at
his
side
he
ca
walk
she
cried
a
sudden
tremble
in
her
voice
look
père
here
is
a
terrible
cut
we
must
carry
him
i
guessed
that
much
replied
radisson
for
that
reason
i
brought
the
blanket
listen
to
that
from
the
darkness
of
the
forest
there
came
a
low
wailing
cry
kazan
lifted
his
head
and
a
trembling
whine
answered
in
his
throat
it
was
gray
wolf
calling
to
him
it
was
a
miracle
that
pierre
radisson
should
put
the
blanket
about
kazan
and
carry
him
in
to
the
camp
without
scratch
or
bite
it
was
this
miracle
that
he
achieved
with
joan
arm
resting
on
kazan
shaggy
neck
as
she
held
one
end
of
the
blanket
they
laid
him
down
close
to
the
fire
and
after
a
little
it
was
the
man
again
who
brought
warm
water
and
washed
away
the
blood
from
the
torn
leg
and
then
put
something
on
it
that
was
soft
and
warm
and
soothing
and
finally
bound
a
cloth
about
it
all
this
was
strange
and
new
to
kazan
pierre
hand
as
well
as
the
girl
stroked
his
head
it
was
the
man
who
brought
him
a
gruel
of
meal
and
tallow
and
urged
him
to
eat
while
joan
sat
with
her
chin
in
her
two
hands
looking
at
the
dog
and
talking
to
him
after
this
when
he
was
quite
comfortable
and
no
longer
afraid
he
heard
a
strange
small
cry
from
the
furry
bundle
on
the
sledge
that
brought
his
head
up
with
a
jerk
joan
saw
the
movement
and
heard
the
low
answering
whimper
in
his
throat
she
turned
quickly
to
the
bundle
talking
and
cooing
to
it
as
she
took
it
in
her
arms
and
then
she
pulled
back
the
bearskin
so
that
kazan
could
see
he
had
never
seen
a
baby
before
and
joan
held
it
out
before
him
so
that
he
could
look
straight
at
it
and
see
what
a
wonderful
creature
it
was
its
little
pink
face
stared
steadily
at
kazan
its
tiny
fists
reached
out
and
it
made
queer
little
sounds
at
him
and
then
suddenly
it
kicked
and
screamed
with
delight
and
laughed
at
those
sounds
kazan
whole
body
relaxed
and
he
dragged
himself
to
the
girl
feet
see
he
likes
the
baby
she
cried
we
must
give
him
a
name
what
shall
it
be
wait
till
morning
for
that
replied
the
father
it
is
late
joan
go
into
the
tent
and
sleep
we
have
no
dogs
now
and
will
travel
slowly
so
we
must
start
early
with
her
hand
on
the
joan
turned
he
came
with
the
wolves
she
said
let
us
call
him
wolf
with
one
arm
she
was
holding
the
little
joan
the
other
she
stretched
out
to
kazan
wolf
wolf
she
called
softly
kazan
eyes
were
on
her
he
knew
that
she
was
speaking
to
him
and
he
drew
himself
a
foot
toward
her
he
knows
it
already
she
cried
good
night
for
a
long
time
after
she
had
gone
into
the
tent
old
pierre
radisson
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
sledge
facing
the
fire
with
kazan
at
his
feet
suddenly
the
silence
was
broken
again
by
gray
wolf
lonely
howl
deep
in
the
forest
kazan
lifted
his
head
and
whined
she
calling
for
you
boy
said
pierre
understandingly
he
coughed
and
clutched
a
hand
to
his
breast
where
the
pain
seemed
rending
him
lung
he
said
speaking
straight
at
kazan
got
it
early
in
the
winter
up
at
fond
du
lac
hope
we
get
home
in
time
with
the
kids
in
the
loneliness
and
emptiness
of
the
big
northern
wilderness
one
falls
into
the
habit
of
talking
to
one
self
but
kazan
head
was
alert
and
his
eyes
watchful
so
pierre
spoke
to
him
we
got
to
get
them
home
and
there
only
you
and
me
to
do
it
he
said
twisting
his
beard
suddenly
he
clenched
his
fists
his
hollow
racking
cough
convulsed
him
again
home
he
panted
clutching
his
chest
it
eighty
miles
straight
north
to
the
churchill
and
i
pray
to
god
we
get
there
with
the
kids
before
my
lungs
give
out
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
staggered
a
little
as
he
walked
there
was
a
collar
about
kazan
neck
and
he
chained
him
to
the
sledge
after
that
he
dragged
three
or
four
small
logs
upon
the
fire
and
went
quietly
into
the
tent
where
joan
and
the
baby
were
already
asleep
several
times
that
night
kazan
heard
the
distant
voice
of
gray
wolf
calling
for
him
but
something
told
him
that
he
must
not
answer
it
now
toward
dawn
gray
wolf
came
close
in
to
the
camp
and
for
the
first
time
kazan
replied
to
her
his
howl
awakened
the
man
he
came
out
of
the
tent
peered
for
a
few
moments
up
at
the
sky
built
up
the
fire
and
began
to
prepare
breakfast
he
patted
kazan
on
the
head
and
gave
him
a
chunk
of
meat
joan
came
out
a
few
moments
later
leaving
the
baby
asleep
in
the
tent
she
ran
up
and
kissed
pierre
and
then
dropped
down
on
her
knees
beside
kazan
and
talked
to
him
almost
as
he
had
heard
her
talk
to
the
baby
when
she
jumped
up
to
help
her
father
kazan
followed
her
and
when
joan
saw
him
standing
firmly
upon
his
legs
she
gave
a
cry
of
pleasure
it
was
a
strange
journey
that
began
into
the
north
that
day
pierre
radisson
emptied
the
sledge
of
everything
but
the
tent
blankets
food
and
the
furry
nest
for
baby
joan
then
he
harnessed
himself
in
the
traces
and
dragged
the
sledge
over
the
snow
he
coughed
incessantly
it
a
cough
i
had
half
the
winter
lied
pierre
careful
that
joan
saw
no
sign
of
blood
on
his
lips
or
beard
i
keep
in
the
cabin
for
a
week
when
we
get
home
even
kazan
with
that
strange
beast
knowledge
which
man
unable
to
explain
calls
instinct
knew
that
what
he
said
was
not
the
truth
perhaps
it
was
largely
because
he
had
heard
other
men
cough
like
this
and
that
for
generations
his
ancestors
had
heard
men
cough
as
radisson
coughed
and
had
learned
what
followed
it
more
than
once
he
had
scented
death
in
tepees
and
cabins
which
he
had
not
entered
and
more
than
once
he
had
sniffed
at
the
mystery
of
death
that
was
not
quite
present
but
near
just
as
he
had
caught
at
a
distance
the
subtle
warning
of
storm
and
of
fire
and
that
strange
thing
seemed
to
be
very
near
to
him
now
as
he
followed
at
the
end
of
his
chain
behind
the
sledge
it
made
him
restless
and
half
a
dozen
times
when
the
sledge
stopped
he
sniffed
at
the
bit
of
humanity
buried
in
the
bearskin
each
time
that
he
did
this
joan
was
quickly
at
his
side
and
twice
she
patted
his
scarred
and
grizzled
head
until
every
drop
of
blood
in
his
body
leaped
riotously
with
a
joy
which
his
body
did
not
reveal
this
day
the
chief
thing
that
he
came
to
understand
was
that
the
little
creature
on
the
sledge
was
very
precious
to
the
girl
who
stroked
his
head
and
talked
to
him
and
that
it
was
very
helpless
he
learned
too
that
joan
was
most
delighted
and
that
her
voice
was
softer
and
thrilled
him
more
deeply
when
he
paid
attention
to
that
little
warm
living
thing
in
the
bearskin
for
a
long
time
after
they
made
camp
pierre
radisson
sat
beside
the
fire
he
did
not
smoke
he
stared
straight
into
the
flames
when
at
last
he
rose
to
go
into
the
tent
with
the
girl
and
the
baby
he
bent
over
kazan
and
examined
his
hurt
you
got
to
work
in
the
traces
boy
he
said
we
must
make
the
river
by
night
if
we
do
he
did
not
finish
he
was
choking
back
one
of
those
tearing
coughs
when
the
dropped
behind
him
kazan
lay
stiff
and
alert
his
eyes
filled
with
a
strange
anxiety
he
did
not
like
to
see
radisson
enter
the
tent
for
stronger
than
ever
there
hung
that
oppressive
mystery
in
the
air
about
him
and
it
seemed
to
be
a
part
of
pierre
three
times
that
night
he
heard
faithful
gray
wolf
calling
for
him
deep
in
the
forest
and
each
time
he
answered
her
toward
dawn
she
came
in
close
to
camp
once
he
caught
the
scent
of
her
when
she
circled
around
in
the
wind
and
he
tugged
and
whined
at
the
end
of
his
chain
hoping
that
she
would
come
in
and
lie
down
at
his
side
but
no
sooner
had
radisson
moved
in
the
tent
than
gray
wolf
was
gone
the
man
face
was
thinner
and
his
eyes
were
redder
this
morning
his
cough
was
not
so
loud
or
so
rending
it
was
like
a
wheeze
as
if
something
had
given
way
inside
and
before
the
girl
came
out
he
clutched
his
hands
often
at
his
throat
joan
face
whitened
when
she
saw
him
anxiety
gave
way
to
fear
in
her
eyes
pierre
radisson
laughed
when
she
flung
her
arms
about
him
and
coughed
to
prove
that
what
he
said
was
true
you
see
the
cough
is
not
so
bad
my
joan
he
said
it
is
breaking
up
you
can
not
have
forgotten
it
always
leaves
one
and
weak
it
was
a
cold
bleak
dark
day
that
followed
and
through
it
kazan
and
the
man
tugged
at
the
fore
of
the
sledge
with
joan
following
in
the
trail
behind
kazan
wound
no
longer
hurt
him
he
pulled
steadily
with
all
his
splendid
strength
and
the
man
never
lashed
him
once
but
patted
him
with
his
mittened
hand
on
head
and
back
the
day
grew
steadily
darker
and
in
the
tops
of
the
trees
there
was
the
low
moaning
of
a
storm
darkness
and
the
coming
of
the
storm
did
not
drive
pierre
radisson
into
camp
we
must
reach
the
river
he
said
to
himself
over
and
over
again
we
must
reach
the
river
we
must
reach
the
river
and
he
steadily
urged
kazan
on
to
greater
effort
while
his
own
strength
at
the
end
of
the
traces
grew
less
it
had
begun
to
storm
when
pierre
stopped
to
build
a
fire
at
noon
the
snow
fell
straight
down
in
a
white
deluge
so
thick
that
it
hid
the
tree
trunks
fifty
yards
away
pierre
laughed
when
joan
shivered
and
snuggled
close
up
to
him
with
the
baby
in
her
arms
he
waited
only
an
hour
and
then
fastened
kazan
in
the
traces
again
and
buckled
the
straps
once
more
about
his
own
waist
in
the
silent
gloom
that
was
almost
night
pierre
carried
his
compass
in
his
hand
and
at
last
late
in
the
afternoon
they
came
to
a
break
in
the
and
ahead
of
them
lay
a
plain
across
which
radisson
pointed
an
exultant
hand
there
the
river
joan
he
said
his
voice
faint
and
husky
we
can
camp
here
now
and
wait
for
the
storm
to
pass
under
a
thick
clump
of
spruce
he
put
up
the
tent
and
then
began
gathering
joan
helped
him
as
soon
as
they
had
boiled
coffee
and
eaten
a
supper
of
meat
and
toasted
biscuits
joan
went
into
the
tent
and
dropped
exhausted
on
her
thick
bed
of
balsam
boughs
wrapping
herself
and
the
baby
up
close
in
the
skins
and
blankets
she
had
no
word
for
kazan
and
pierre
was
glad
that
she
was
too
tired
to
sit
beside
the
fire
and
talk
and
yet
kazan
alert
eyes
saw
pierre
start
suddenly
he
rose
from
his
seat
on
the
sledge
and
went
to
the
tent
he
drew
back
the
flap
and
thrust
in
his
head
and
shoulders
asleep
joan
he
asked
almost
father
wo
you
please
come
soon
after
i
smoke
he
said
are
you
comfortable
yes
i
so
tired
and
sleepy
pierre
laughed
softly
in
the
darkness
he
was
gripping
at
his
throat
we
almost
home
joan
that
is
our
river
out
there
the
little
beaver
if
i
should
run
away
and
leave
you
you
could
follow
it
right
to
our
cabin
it
only
forty
miles
do
you
hear
yes
i
know
forty
miles
straight
down
the
river
you
could
lose
yourself
joan
only
you
have
to
be
careful
of
in
the
ice
wo
you
come
to
bed
father
you
tired
and
almost
sick
yes
after
i
smoke
he
repeated
joan
will
you
keep
reminding
me
of
the
i
might
forget
you
can
always
tell
them
for
the
snow
and
the
crust
over
them
are
whiter
than
that
on
the
rest
of
the
ice
and
like
a
sponge
will
you
remember
the
airholes
pierre
dropped
the
and
returned
to
the
fire
he
staggered
as
he
walked
good
night
boy
he
said
guess
i
better
go
in
with
the
kids
two
days
more
forty
miles
two
days
kazan
watched
him
as
he
entered
the
tent
he
laid
his
weight
against
the
end
of
his
chain
until
the
collar
shut
off
his
wind
his
legs
and
back
twitched
in
that
tent
where
radisson
had
gone
were
joan
and
the
baby
he
knew
that
pierre
would
not
hurt
them
but
he
knew
also
that
with
pierre
radisson
something
terrible
and
impending
was
hovering
very
near
to
them
he
wanted
the
man
outside
by
the
fire
where
he
could
lie
still
and
watch
him
in
the
tent
there
was
silence
nearer
to
him
than
before
came
gray
wolf
cry
each
night
she
was
calling
earlier
and
coming
closer
to
the
camp
he
wanted
her
very
near
to
him
but
he
did
not
even
whine
in
response
he
dared
not
break
that
strange
silence
in
the
tent
he
lay
still
for
a
long
time
tired
and
lame
from
the
day
journey
but
sleepless
the
fire
burned
lower
the
wind
in
the
died
away
and
the
thick
gray
clouds
rolled
like
a
massive
curtain
from
under
the
skies
the
stars
began
to
glow
white
and
metallic
and
from
far
in
the
north
there
came
faintly
a
crisping
moaning
sound
like
steel
running
over
frosty
snow
the
mysterious
monotone
of
the
northern
lights
after
that
it
grew
steadily
and
swiftly
colder
gray
wolf
did
not
compass
herself
by
the
direction
of
the
wind
she
followed
like
a
sneaking
shadow
over
the
trail
pierre
radisson
had
made
and
when
kazan
heard
her
again
long
after
midnight
he
lay
with
his
head
erect
and
his
body
rigid
save
for
a
curious
twitching
of
his
muscles
there
was
a
new
note
in
gray
wolf
voice
a
wailing
note
in
which
there
was
more
than
the
it
was
the
message
and
at
the
sound
of
it
kazan
rose
from
out
of
his
silence
and
his
fear
and
with
his
head
turned
straight
up
to
the
sky
he
howled
as
the
wild
dogs
of
the
north
howl
before
the
tepees
of
masters
who
are
newly
dead
pierre
radisson
was
dead
chapter
vii
out
of
the
blizzard
it
was
dawn
when
the
baby
snuggled
close
to
joan
warm
breast
and
awakened
her
with
its
cry
of
hunger
she
opened
her
eyes
brushed
back
the
thick
hair
from
her
face
and
could
see
where
the
shadowy
form
of
her
father
was
lying
at
the
other
side
of
the
tent
he
was
very
quiet
and
she
was
pleased
that
he
was
still
sleeping
she
knew
that
the
day
before
he
had
been
very
near
to
exhaustion
and
so
for
half
an
hour
longer
she
lay
quiet
cooing
softly
to
the
baby
joan
then
she
arose
cautiously
tucked
the
baby
in
the
warm
blankets
and
furs
put
on
her
heavier
garments
and
went
outside
by
this
time
it
was
broad
day
and
she
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
when
she
saw
that
the
storm
had
passed
it
was
bitterly
cold
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
had
never
known
it
to
be
so
cold
in
all
her
life
the
fire
was
completely
out
kazan
was
huddled
in
a
round
ball
his
nose
tucked
under
his
body
he
raised
his
head
shivering
as
joan
came
out
with
her
heavily
moccasined
foot
joan
scattered
the
ashes
and
charred
sticks
where
the
fire
had
been
there
was
not
a
spark
left
in
returning
to
the
tent
she
stopped
for
a
moment
beside
kazan
and
patted
his
shaggy
head
poor
wolf
she
said
i
wish
i
had
given
you
one
of
the
bearskins
she
threw
back
the
and
entered
for
the
first
time
she
saw
her
father
face
in
the
light
and
outside
kazan
heard
the
terrible
moaning
cry
that
broke
from
her
lips
no
one
could
have
looked
at
pierre
radisson
face
once
and
not
have
understood
after
that
one
agonizing
cry
joan
flung
herself
upon
her
breast
sobbing
so
softly
that
even
kazan
sharp
ears
heard
no
sound
she
remained
there
in
her
grief
until
every
vital
energy
of
womanhood
and
motherhood
in
her
girlish
body
was
roused
to
action
by
the
wailing
cry
of
baby
joan
then
she
sprang
to
her
feet
and
ran
out
through
the
tent
opening
kazan
tugged
at
the
end
of
his
chain
to
meet
her
but
she
saw
nothing
of
him
now
the
terror
of
the
wilderness
is
greater
than
that
of
death
and
in
an
instant
it
had
fallen
upon
joan
it
was
not
because
of
fear
for
herself
it
was
the
baby
the
wailing
cries
from
the
tent
pierced
her
like
and
then
all
at
once
there
came
to
her
what
old
pierre
had
said
the
night
before
his
words
about
the
river
the
the
home
forty
miles
away
could
lose
yourself
he
had
guessed
what
might
happen
she
bundled
the
baby
deep
in
the
furs
and
returned
to
the
her
one
thought
now
was
that
they
must
have
fire
she
made
a
little
pile
of
covered
it
with
bits
of
wood
and
went
into
the
tent
for
the
matches
pierre
radisson
carried
them
in
a
box
in
a
pocket
of
his
bearskin
coat
she
sobbed
as
she
kneeled
beside
him
again
and
obtained
the
box
as
the
fire
flared
up
she
added
other
bits
of
wood
and
then
some
of
the
larger
pieces
that
pierre
had
dragged
into
camp
the
fire
gave
her
courage
forty
miles
and
the
river
led
to
their
home
she
must
make
that
with
the
baby
and
wolf
for
the
first
time
she
turned
to
him
and
spoke
his
name
as
she
put
her
hand
on
his
head
after
that
she
gave
him
a
chunk
of
meat
which
she
thawed
out
over
the
fire
and
melted
the
snow
for
tea
she
was
not
hungry
but
she
recalled
how
her
father
had
made
her
eat
four
or
five
times
a
day
so
she
forced
herself
to
make
a
breakfast
of
a
biscuit
a
shred
of
meat
and
as
much
hot
tea
as
she
could
drink
the
terrible
hour
she
dreaded
followed
that
she
wrapped
blankets
closely
about
her
father
body
and
tied
them
with
babiche
cord
after
that
she
piled
all
the
furs
and
blankets
that
remained
on
the
sledge
close
to
the
fire
and
snuggled
baby
joan
deep
down
in
them
pulling
down
the
tent
was
a
task
the
ropes
were
stiff
and
frozen
and
when
she
had
finished
one
of
her
hands
was
bleeding
she
piled
the
tent
on
the
sledge
and
then
half
covering
her
face
turned
and
looked
back
pierre
radisson
lay
on
his
balsam
bed
with
nothing
over
him
now
but
the
gray
sky
and
the
kazan
stood
and
sniffed
the
air
his
spine
bristled
when
joan
went
back
slowly
and
kneeled
beside
the
object
when
she
returned
to
him
her
face
was
white
and
tense
and
now
there
was
a
strange
and
terrible
look
in
her
eyes
as
she
stared
out
across
the
barren
she
put
him
in
the
traces
and
fastened
about
her
slender
waist
the
strap
that
pierre
had
used
thus
they
struck
out
for
the
river
floundering
in
the
freshly
fallen
and
drifted
snow
joan
stumbled
in
a
drift
and
fell
her
loose
hair
flying
in
a
shimmering
veil
over
the
snow
with
a
mighty
pull
kazan
was
at
her
side
and
his
cold
muzzle
touched
her
face
as
she
drew
herself
to
her
feet
for
a
moment
joan
took
his
shaggy
head
between
her
two
hands
wolf
she
moaned
oh
wolf
she
went
on
her
breath
coming
pantingly
now
even
from
her
brief
exertion
the
snow
was
not
so
deep
on
the
ice
of
the
river
but
a
wind
was
rising
it
came
from
the
north
and
east
straight
in
her
face
and
joan
bowed
her
head
as
she
pulled
with
kazan
half
a
mile
down
the
river
she
stopped
and
no
longer
could
she
repress
the
hopelessness
that
rose
to
her
lips
in
a
sobbing
choking
cry
forty
miles
she
clutched
her
hands
at
her
breast
and
stood
breathing
like
one
who
had
been
beaten
her
back
to
the
wind
the
baby
was
quiet
joan
went
back
and
peered
down
under
the
furs
and
what
she
saw
there
spurred
her
on
again
almost
fiercely
twice
she
stumbled
to
her
knees
in
the
drifts
during
the
next
quarter
of
a
mile
after
that
there
was
a
stretch
of
ice
and
kazan
pulled
the
sledge
alone
joan
walked
at
his
side
there
was
a
pain
in
her
chest
a
thousand
needles
seemed
pricking
her
face
and
suddenly
she
remembered
the
thermometer
she
exposed
it
for
a
time
on
the
top
of
the
tent
when
she
looked
at
it
a
few
minutes
later
it
was
thirty
degrees
below
zero
forty
miles
and
her
father
had
told
her
that
she
could
make
it
and
could
not
lose
herself
but
she
did
not
know
that
even
her
father
would
have
been
afraid
to
face
the
north
that
day
with
the
temperature
at
thirty
below
and
a
moaning
wind
bringing
the
first
warning
of
a
blizzard
the
timber
was
far
behind
her
now
ahead
there
was
nothing
but
the
pitiless
barren
and
the
timber
beyond
that
was
hidden
by
the
gray
gloom
of
the
day
if
there
had
been
trees
joan
heart
would
not
have
choked
so
with
terror
but
there
was
nothing
nothing
but
that
gray
ghostly
gloom
with
the
rim
of
the
sky
touching
the
earth
a
mile
away
the
snow
grew
heavy
under
her
feet
again
always
she
was
watching
for
those
treacherous
traps
in
the
ice
her
father
had
spoken
of
but
she
found
now
that
all
the
ice
and
snow
looked
alike
to
her
and
that
there
was
a
growing
pain
back
of
her
eyes
it
was
the
intense
cold
the
river
widened
into
a
small
lake
and
here
the
wind
struck
her
in
the
face
with
such
force
that
her
weight
was
taken
from
the
strap
and
kazan
dragged
the
sledge
alone
a
few
inches
of
snow
impeded
her
as
much
as
a
foot
had
done
before
little
by
little
she
dropped
back
kazan
forged
to
her
side
every
ounce
of
his
magnificent
strength
in
the
traces
by
the
time
they
were
on
the
river
channel
again
joan
was
at
the
back
of
the
sledge
following
in
the
trail
made
by
kazan
she
was
powerless
to
help
him
she
felt
more
and
more
the
leaden
weight
of
her
legs
there
was
but
one
hope
and
that
was
the
forest
if
they
did
not
reach
it
soon
within
half
an
hour
she
would
be
able
to
go
no
farther
over
and
over
again
she
moaned
a
prayer
for
her
baby
as
she
struggled
on
she
fell
in
the
kazan
and
the
sledge
became
only
a
dark
blotch
to
her
and
then
all
at
once
she
saw
that
they
were
leaving
her
they
were
not
more
than
twenty
feet
ahead
of
her
but
the
blotch
seemed
to
be
a
vast
distance
away
every
bit
of
life
and
strength
in
her
body
was
now
bent
upon
reaching
the
sledge
and
baby
joan
it
seemed
an
interminable
time
before
she
gained
with
the
sledge
only
six
feet
ahead
of
her
she
struggled
for
what
seemed
to
her
to
be
an
hour
before
she
could
reach
out
and
touch
it
with
a
moan
she
flung
herself
forward
and
fell
upon
it
she
no
longer
heard
the
wailing
of
the
storm
she
no
longer
felt
discomfort
with
her
face
in
the
furs
under
which
baby
joan
was
buried
there
came
to
her
with
swiftness
and
joy
a
vision
of
warmth
and
home
and
then
the
vision
faded
away
and
was
followed
by
deep
night
kazan
stopped
in
the
trail
he
came
back
then
and
sat
down
upon
his
haunches
beside
her
waiting
for
her
to
move
and
speak
but
she
was
very
still
he
thrust
his
nose
into
her
loose
hair
a
whine
rose
in
his
throat
and
suddenly
he
raised
his
head
and
sniffed
in
the
face
of
the
wind
something
came
to
him
with
that
wind
he
muzzled
joan
again
hut
she
did
not
stir
then
he
went
forward
and
stood
in
his
traces
ready
for
the
pull
and
looked
hack
at
her
still
she
did
not
move
or
speak
and
kazan
whine
gave
place
to
a
sharp
excited
bark
the
strange
thing
in
the
wind
came
to
him
stronger
for
a
moment
he
began
to
pull
the
had
frozen
to
the
snow
and
it
took
every
ounce
of
his
strength
to
free
them
twice
during
the
next
five
minutes
he
stopped
and
sniffed
the
air
the
third
time
that
he
halted
in
a
drift
of
snow
he
returned
to
joan
side
again
and
whined
to
awaken
her
then
he
tugged
again
at
the
end
of
his
traces
and
foot
by
foot
he
dragged
the
sledge
through
the
drift
beyond
the
drift
there
was
a
stretch
of
clear
ice
and
here
kazan
rested
during
a
lull
in
the
wind
the
scent
came
to
him
stronger
than
before
at
the
end
of
the
clear
ice
was
a
narrow
break
in
the
shore
where
a
creek
ran
into
the
main
stream
if
joan
had
been
conscious
she
would
have
urged
him
straight
ahead
but
kazan
turned
into
the
break
and
for
ten
minutes
he
struggled
through
the
snow
without
a
rest
whining
more
and
more
frequently
until
at
last
the
whine
broke
into
a
joyous
bark
ahead
of
him
close
to
the
creek
was
a
small
cabin
smoke
was
rising
out
of
the
chimney
it
was
the
scent
of
smoke
that
had
come
to
him
in
the
wind
a
hard
level
slope
reached
to
the
cabin
door
and
with
the
last
strength
that
was
in
him
kazan
dragged
his
burden
up
that
then
he
settled
himself
back
beside
joan
lifted
his
shaggy
head
to
the
dark
sky
and
howled
a
moment
later
the
door
opened
a
man
came
out
kazan
reddened
eyes
followed
him
watchfully
as
he
ran
to
the
sledge
he
heard
his
startled
exclamation
as
he
bent
over
joan
in
another
lull
of
the
wind
there
came
from
out
of
the
mass
of
furs
on
the
sledge
the
wailing
voice
of
baby
joan
a
deep
sigh
of
relief
heaved
up
from
kazan
chest
he
was
exhausted
his
strength
was
gone
his
feet
were
torn
and
bleeding
but
the
voice
of
baby
joan
filled
him
with
a
strange
happiness
and
he
lay
down
in
his
traces
while
the
man
carried
joan
and
the
baby
into
the
life
and
warmth
of
the
cabin
a
few
minutes
later
the
man
reappeared
he
was
not
old
like
pierre
radisson
he
came
close
to
kazan
and
looked
down
at
him
my
god
he
said
and
you
did
that
he
bent
down
fearlessly
unfastened
him
from
the
traces
and
led
him
toward
the
cabin
door
kazan
hesitated
but
once
almost
on
the
threshold
he
turned
his
head
swift
and
alert
from
out
of
the
moaning
and
wailing
of
the
storm
it
seemed
to
him
that
for
a
moment
he
had
heard
the
voice
of
gray
wolf
then
the
cabin
door
closed
behind
him
back
in
a
shadowy
corner
of
the
cabin
he
lay
while
the
man
prepared
something
over
a
hot
stove
for
joan
it
was
a
long
time
before
joan
rose
from
the
cot
on
which
the
man
had
placed
her
after
that
kazan
heard
her
sobbing
and
then
the
man
made
her
eat
and
for
a
time
they
talked
then
the
stranger
hung
up
a
big
blanket
in
front
of
the
bunk
and
sat
down
close
to
the
stove
quietly
kazan
slipped
along
the
wall
and
crept
under
the
bunk
for
a
long
time
he
could
hear
the
sobbing
breath
of
the
girl
then
all
was
still
the
next
morning
he
slipped
out
through
the
door
when
the
man
opened
it
and
sped
swiftly
into
the
forest
half
a
mile
away
he
found
the
trail
of
gray
wolf
and
called
to
her
from
the
frozen
river
came
her
reply
and
he
went
to
her
vainly
gray
wolf
tried
to
lure
him
back
into
their
old
haunts
away
from
the
cabin
and
the
scent
of
man
late
that
morning
the
man
harnessed
his
dogs
and
from
the
fringe
of
the
forest
kazan
saw
him
tuck
joan
and
the
baby
among
the
furs
on
the
sledge
as
old
pierre
had
done
all
that
day
he
followed
in
the
trail
of
the
team
with
gray
wolf
slinking
behind
him
they
traveled
until
dark
and
then
under
the
stars
and
the
moon
that
had
followed
the
storm
the
man
still
urged
on
his
team
it
was
deep
in
the
night
when
they
came
to
another
cabin
and
the
man
beat
upon
the
door
a
light
the
opening
of
the
door
the
joyous
welcome
of
a
man
voice
joan
sobbing
cry
kazan
heard
these
from
the
shadows
in
which
he
was
hidden
and
then
slipped
back
to
gray
wolf
in
the
days
and
weeks
that
followed
joan
the
lure
of
the
cabin
and
of
the
woman
hand
held
kazan
as
he
had
tolerated
pierre
so
now
he
tolerated
the
younger
man
who
lived
with
joan
and
the
baby
he
knew
that
the
man
was
very
dear
to
joan
and
that
the
baby
was
very
dear
to
him
as
it
was
to
the
girl
it
was
not
until
the
third
day
that
joan
succeeded
in
coaxing
him
into
the
cabin
and
that
was
the
day
on
which
the
man
returned
with
the
dead
and
frozen
body
of
pierre
it
was
husband
who
first
found
the
name
on
the
collar
he
wore
and
they
began
calling
him
kazan
half
a
mile
away
at
the
summit
of
a
huge
mass
of
rock
which
the
indians
called
the
sun
rock
he
and
gray
wolf
had
found
a
home
and
from
here
they
went
down
to
their
hunts
on
the
plain
and
often
the
girl
voice
reached
up
to
them
calling
kazan
through
all
the
long
winter
kazan
hovered
thus
between
the
lure
of
joan
and
the
cabin
and
gray
wolf
then
came
spring
and
the
great
change
chapter
viii
the
great
change
the
rocks
the
ridges
and
the
valleys
were
taking
on
a
warmer
glow
the
poplar
buds
were
ready
to
burst
the
scent
of
balsam
and
of
spruce
grew
heavier
in
the
air
each
day
and
all
through
the
wilderness
in
plain
and
forest
there
was
the
rippling
murmur
of
the
spring
floods
finding
their
way
to
hudson
bay
in
that
great
bay
there
was
the
rumble
and
crash
of
the
ice
fields
thundering
down
in
the
early
through
the
roes
welcome
the
doorway
to
the
arctic
and
for
that
reason
there
still
came
with
the
april
wind
an
occasional
sharp
breath
of
winter
kazan
had
sheltered
himself
against
that
wind
not
a
breath
of
air
stirred
in
the
sunny
spot
the
had
chosen
for
himself
he
was
more
comfortable
than
he
had
been
at
any
time
during
the
six
months
of
terrible
winter
and
as
he
slept
he
dreamed
gray
wolf
his
wild
mate
lay
near
him
flat
on
her
belly
her
forepaws
reaching
out
her
eyes
and
nostrils
as
keen
and
alert
as
the
smell
of
man
could
make
them
for
there
was
that
smell
of
man
as
well
as
of
balsam
and
spruce
in
the
warm
spring
air
she
gazed
anxiously
and
sometimes
steadily
at
kazan
as
he
slept
her
own
gray
spine
stiffened
when
she
saw
the
tawny
hair
along
kazan
back
bristle
at
some
dream
vision
she
whined
softly
as
his
upper
lip
snarled
back
showing
his
long
white
fangs
but
for
the
most
part
kazan
lay
quiet
save
for
the
muscular
twitchings
of
legs
shoulders
and
muzzle
which
always
tell
when
a
dog
is
dreaming
and
as
he
dreamed
there
came
to
the
door
of
the
cabin
out
on
the
plain
a
with
a
big
brown
braid
over
her
shoulder
who
called
through
the
cup
of
her
hands
kazan
kazan
kazan
the
voice
reached
faintly
to
the
top
of
the
sun
rock
and
gray
wolf
flattened
her
ears
kazan
stirred
and
in
another
instant
he
was
awake
and
on
his
feet
he
leaped
to
an
outcropping
ledge
sniffing
the
air
and
looking
far
out
over
the
plain
that
lay
below
them
over
the
plain
the
woman
voice
came
to
them
again
and
kazan
ran
to
the
edge
of
the
rock
and
whined
gray
wolf
stepped
softly
to
his
side
and
laid
her
muzzle
on
his
shoulder
she
had
grown
to
know
what
the
voice
meant
day
and
night
she
feared
it
more
than
she
feared
the
scent
or
sound
of
man
since
she
had
given
up
the
pack
and
her
old
life
for
kazan
the
voice
had
become
gray
wolf
greatest
enemy
and
she
hated
it
it
took
kazan
from
her
and
wherever
it
went
kazan
followed
night
after
night
it
robbed
her
of
her
mate
and
left
her
to
wander
alone
under
the
stars
and
the
moon
keeping
faithfully
to
her
loneliness
and
never
once
responding
with
her
own
tongue
to
the
of
her
wild
brothers
and
sisters
in
the
forests
and
out
on
the
plains
usually
she
would
snarl
at
the
voice
and
sometimes
nip
kazan
lightly
to
show
her
displeasure
but
as
the
voice
came
a
third
time
she
slunk
back
into
the
darkness
of
a
fissure
between
two
rocks
and
kazan
saw
only
the
fiery
glow
of
her
eyes
kazan
ran
nervously
to
the
trail
their
feet
had
worn
up
to
the
top
of
the
sun
rock
and
stood
undecided
all
day
and
yesterday
he
had
been
uneasy
and
disturbed
whatever
it
was
that
stirred
him
seemed
to
be
in
the
air
for
he
could
not
see
it
or
hear
it
or
scent
it
but
he
could
it
he
went
to
the
fissure
and
sniffed
at
gray
wolf
usually
she
whined
coaxingly
but
her
response
was
to
draw
back
her
lips
until
he
could
see
her
white
fangs
a
fourth
tune
the
voice
came
to
them
faintly
and
she
snapped
fiercely
at
some
unseen
thing
in
the
darkness
between
the
two
rocks
kazan
went
again
to
the
trail
still
hesitating
then
he
began
to
go
down
it
was
a
narrow
winding
trail
worn
only
by
the
pads
and
claws
of
animals
for
the
sun
rock
was
a
huge
crag
that
rose
almost
sheer
up
for
a
hundred
feet
above
the
tops
of
the
spruce
and
balsam
its
bald
crest
catching
the
first
gleams
of
the
sun
in
the
morning
and
the
last
glow
of
it
in
the
evening
gray
wolf
had
first
led
kazan
to
the
security
of
the
retreat
at
the
top
of
the
rock
when
he
reached
the
bottom
he
no
longer
hesitated
but
darted
swiftly
in
the
direction
of
the
cabin
because
of
that
instinct
of
the
wild
that
was
still
in
him
he
always
approached
the
cabin
with
caution
he
never
gave
warning
and
for
a
moment
joan
was
startled
when
she
looked
up
from
her
baby
and
saw
kazan
shaggy
head
and
shoulders
in
the
open
door
the
baby
struggled
and
kicked
in
her
delight
and
held
out
her
two
hands
with
cooing
cries
to
kazan
joan
too
held
out
a
hand
kazan
she
cried
softly
come
in
kazan
slowly
the
wild
red
light
in
kazan
eyes
softened
he
put
a
forefoot
on
the
sill
and
stood
there
while
the
girl
urged
him
again
suddenly
his
legs
seemed
to
sink
a
little
under
him
his
tail
drooped
and
he
slunk
in
with
that
doggish
air
of
having
committed
a
crime
the
creatures
he
loved
were
in
the
cabin
but
the
cabin
itself
he
hated
he
hated
all
cabins
for
they
all
breathed
of
the
club
and
the
whip
and
bondage
like
all
he
preferred
the
open
snow
for
a
bed
and
the
for
shelter
joan
dropped
her
hand
to
his
head
and
at
its
touch
there
thrilled
through
him
that
strange
joy
that
was
his
reward
for
leaving
gray
wolf
and
the
wild
slowly
he
raised
his
head
until
his
black
muzzle
rested
on
her
lap
and
he
closed
his
eyes
while
that
wonderful
little
creature
that
mystified
him
so
the
baby
prodded
him
with
her
tiny
feet
and
pulled
his
tawny
hair
he
loved
these
even
more
than
the
touch
of
joan
hand
motionless
undemonstrative
in
every
muscle
of
his
body
kazan
stood
scarcely
breathing
more
than
once
this
lack
of
demonstration
had
urged
joan
husband
to
warn
her
but
the
wolf
that
was
in
kazan
his
wild
aloofness
even
his
mating
with
gray
wolf
had
made
her
love
him
more
she
understood
and
had
faith
in
him
in
the
days
of
the
last
snow
kazan
had
proved
himself
a
neighboring
trapper
had
run
over
with
his
team
and
the
baby
joan
had
toddled
up
to
one
of
the
big
huskies
there
was
a
fierce
snap
of
jaws
a
scream
of
horror
from
joan
a
shout
from
the
men
as
they
leaped
toward
the
pack
but
kazan
was
ahead
of
them
all
in
a
gray
streak
that
traveled
with
the
speed
of
a
bullet
he
was
at
the
big
husky
throat
when
they
pulled
him
off
the
husky
was
dead
joan
thought
of
that
now
as
the
baby
kicked
and
tousled
kazan
head
good
old
kazan
she
cried
softly
putting
her
face
down
close
to
him
we
glad
you
came
kazan
for
we
going
to
be
alone
baby
and
daddy
gone
to
the
post
and
you
must
care
for
us
while
away
she
tickled
his
nose
with
the
end
of
her
long
shining
braid
this
always
delighted
the
baby
for
in
spite
of
his
stoicism
kazan
had
to
sniff
and
sometimes
to
sneeze
and
twig
his
ears
and
it
pleased
him
too
he
loved
the
sweet
scent
of
joan
hair
and
you
fight
for
us
if
you
had
to
would
you
she
went
on
then
she
rose
quietly
i
must
close
the
door
she
said
i
do
want
you
to
go
away
again
kazan
you
must
stay
with
us
kazan
went
off
to
his
corner
and
lay
down
just
as
there
had
been
some
strange
thing
at
the
top
of
the
sun
rock
to
disturb
him
that
day
so
now
there
was
a
mystery
that
disturbed
him
in
the
cabin
he
sniffed
the
air
trying
to
fathom
its
secret
whatever
it
was
it
seemed
to
make
his
mistress
different
too
and
she
was
digging
out
all
sorts
of
odds
and
ends
of
things
about
the
cabin
and
doing
them
up
in
packages
late
that
night
before
she
went
to
bed
joan
came
and
snuggled
her
hand
close
down
beside
him
for
a
few
moments
we
going
away
she
whispered
and
there
was
a
curious
tremble
that
was
almost
a
sob
in
her
voice
we
going
home
kazan
we
going
away
down
where
his
people
live
where
they
have
churches
and
cities
and
music
and
all
the
beautiful
things
in
the
world
and
we
going
to
take
kazan
kazan
did
understand
but
he
was
happy
at
having
the
woman
so
near
to
him
and
talking
to
him
at
these
times
he
forgot
gray
wolf
the
dog
that
was
in
him
surged
over
his
of
wildness
and
the
woman
and
the
baby
alone
filled
his
world
but
after
joan
had
gone
to
her
bed
and
all
was
quiet
in
the
cabin
his
old
uneasiness
returned
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
moved
stealthily
about
the
cabin
sniffing
at
the
walls
the
door
and
the
things
his
mistress
had
done
into
packages
a
low
whine
rose
in
his
throat
joan
half
asleep
heard
it
and
murmured
be
quiet
kazan
go
to
sleep
go
to
sleep
long
after
that
kazan
stood
rigid
in
the
center
of
the
room
listening
trembling
and
faintly
he
heard
far
away
the
wailing
cry
of
gray
wolf
but
it
was
not
the
cry
of
loneliness
it
sent
a
thrill
through
him
he
ran
to
the
door
and
whined
but
joan
was
deep
in
slumber
and
did
not
hear
him
once
more
he
heard
the
cry
and
only
once
then
the
night
grew
still
he
crouched
down
near
the
door
joan
found
him
there
still
watchful
still
listening
when
she
awoke
in
the
early
morning
she
came
to
open
the
door
for
him
and
in
a
moment
he
was
gone
his
feet
seemed
scarcely
to
touch
the
earth
as
he
sped
in
the
direction
of
the
sun
rock
across
the
plain
he
could
see
the
cap
of
it
already
painted
with
a
golden
glow
he
came
to
the
narrow
winding
trail
and
wormed
his
way
up
it
swiftly
gray
wolf
was
not
at
the
top
to
greet
him
but
he
could
smell
her
and
the
scent
of
that
other
thing
was
strong
in
the
air
his
muscles
tightened
his
legs
grew
tense
deep
down
in
his
chest
there
began
the
low
rumble
of
a
growl
he
knew
now
what
that
strange
thing
was
that
had
haunted
him
and
made
him
uneasy
it
was
something
that
lived
and
breathed
had
invaded
the
home
which
he
and
gray
wolf
had
chosen
he
bared
his
long
fangs
and
a
snarl
of
defiance
drew
back
his
lips
prepared
to
spring
his
neck
and
head
reaching
out
he
approached
the
two
rocks
between
which
gray
wolf
had
crept
the
night
before
she
was
still
there
and
with
her
was
after
a
moment
the
tenseness
left
kazan
body
his
bristling
crest
drooped
until
it
lay
flat
his
ears
shot
forward
and
he
put
his
head
and
shoulders
between
the
two
rocks
and
whined
softly
and
gray
wolf
whined
slowly
kazan
backed
out
and
faced
the
rising
sun
then
he
lay
down
so
that
his
body
shielded
i
the
entrance
to
the
chamber
between
the
rocks
gray
wolf
was
a
mother
chapter
ix
the
tragedy
on
sun
rock
all
that
day
kazan
guarded
the
top
of
the
sun
rock
fate
and
the
fear
and
brutality
of
masters
had
heretofore
kept
him
from
fatherhood
and
he
was
puzzled
something
told
him
now
that
he
belonged
to
the
sun
rock
and
not
to
the
cabin
the
call
that
came
to
him
from
over
the
plain
was
not
so
strong
at
dusk
gray
wolf
came
out
from
her
retreat
and
slunk
to
his
side
whimpering
and
nipped
gently
at
his
shaggy
neck
it
was
the
old
instinct
of
his
fathers
that
made
him
respond
by
caressing
gray
wolf
face
with
his
tongue
then
gray
wolf
jaws
opened
and
she
laughed
in
short
panting
breaths
as
if
she
had
been
hard
run
she
was
happy
and
as
they
heard
a
little
snuffling
sound
from
between
the
rocks
kazan
wagged
his
tail
and
gray
wolf
darted
back
to
her
young
the
babyish
cry
and
its
effect
upon
gray
wolf
taught
kazan
his
first
lesson
in
fatherhood
instinct
again
told
him
that
gray
wolf
could
not
go
down
to
the
hunt
with
him
now
that
she
must
stay
at
the
top
of
the
sun
rock
so
when
the
moon
rose
he
went
down
alone
and
toward
dawn
returned
with
a
big
white
rabbit
between
his
jaws
it
was
the
wild
in
him
that
made
him
do
this
and
gray
wolf
ate
ravenously
then
he
knew
that
each
night
hereafter
he
must
hunt
for
gray
wolf
and
the
little
whimpering
creatures
hidden
between
the
two
rocks
the
next
day
and
still
the
next
he
did
not
go
to
the
cabin
though
he
heard
the
voices
of
both
the
man
and
the
woman
calling
him
on
the
fifth
he
went
down
and
joan
and
the
baby
were
so
glad
that
the
woman
hugged
him
and
the
baby
kicked
and
laughed
and
screamed
at
him
while
the
man
stood
by
cautiously
watching
their
demonstrations
with
a
gleam
of
disapprobation
in
his
eyes
i
afraid
of
him
he
told
joan
for
the
hundredth
time
that
the
in
his
eyes
he
of
a
treacherous
breed
sometimes
i
wish
we
never
brought
him
home
if
we
had
where
would
the
baby
have
gone
joan
reminded
him
a
little
catch
in
her
voice
i
had
almost
forgotten
that
said
her
husband
kazan
you
old
devil
i
guess
i
love
you
too
he
laid
his
hand
caressingly
on
kazan
head
wonder
how
he
take
to
life
down
there
he
asked
he
has
always
been
used
to
the
forests
it
seem
mighty
strange
and
so
have
i
always
been
used
to
the
forests
whispered
joan
i
guess
that
why
i
love
kazan
next
to
you
and
the
baby
kazan
dear
old
kazan
this
time
kazan
felt
and
scented
more
of
that
mysterious
change
in
the
cabin
joan
and
her
husband
talked
incessantly
of
their
plans
when
they
were
together
and
when
the
man
was
away
joan
talked
to
the
baby
and
to
him
and
each
time
that
he
came
down
to
the
cabin
during
the
week
that
followed
he
grew
more
and
more
restless
until
at
last
the
man
noticed
the
change
in
him
i
believe
he
knows
he
said
to
joan
one
evening
i
believe
he
knows
we
preparing
to
leave
then
he
added
the
river
was
rising
again
it
will
be
another
week
before
we
can
start
perhaps
longer
that
same
night
the
moon
flooded
the
top
of
the
sun
rock
with
a
golden
light
and
out
into
the
glow
of
it
came
gray
wolf
with
her
three
little
whelps
toddling
behind
her
there
was
much
about
these
soft
little
balls
that
tumbled
about
him
and
snuggled
in
his
tawny
coat
that
reminded
kazan
of
the
baby
at
times
they
made
the
same
queer
soft
little
sounds
and
they
staggered
about
on
their
four
little
legs
just
as
helplessly
as
baby
joan
made
her
way
about
on
two
he
did
not
fondle
them
as
gray
wolf
did
but
the
touch
of
them
and
their
babyish
whimperings
filled
him
with
a
kind
of
pleasure
that
he
had
never
experienced
before
the
moon
was
straight
above
them
and
the
night
was
almost
as
bright
as
day
when
he
went
down
again
to
hunt
for
gray
wolf
at
the
foot
of
the
rock
a
big
white
rabbit
popped
up
ahead
of
him
and
he
gave
chase
for
half
a
mile
he
pursued
until
the
wolf
instinct
in
him
rose
over
the
dog
and
he
gave
up
the
futile
race
a
deer
he
might
have
overtaken
but
small
game
the
wolf
must
hunt
as
the
fox
hunts
it
and
he
began
to
slip
through
the
thickets
slowly
and
as
quietly
as
a
shadow
he
was
a
mile
from
the
sun
rock
when
two
quick
leaps
put
gray
wolf
supper
between
his
jaws
he
trotted
back
slowly
dropping
the
big
hare
now
and
then
to
rest
when
he
came
to
the
narrow
trail
that
led
to
the
top
of
the
sun
rock
he
stopped
in
that
trail
was
the
warm
scent
of
strange
feet
the
rabbit
fell
from
his
jaws
every
hair
in
his
body
was
suddenly
electrified
into
life
what
he
scented
was
not
the
scent
of
a
rabbit
a
marten
or
a
porcupine
fang
and
claw
had
climbed
the
path
ahead
of
him
and
then
coming
faintly
to
him
from
the
top
of
the
rock
he
heard
sounds
which
sent
him
up
with
a
terrible
whining
cry
when
he
reached
the
summit
he
saw
in
the
white
moonlight
a
scene
that
stopped
him
for
a
single
moment
close
to
the
edge
of
the
sheer
fall
to
the
rocks
fifty
feet
below
gray
wolf
was
engaged
in
a
with
a
huge
gray
lynx
she
was
down
and
under
and
from
her
there
came
a
sudden
sharp
terrible
cry
of
pain
kazan
flew
across
the
rock
his
attack
was
the
swift
silent
assault
of
the
wolf
combined
with
the
greater
courage
the
fury
and
the
strategy
of
the
husky
another
husky
would
have
died
in
that
first
attack
but
the
lynx
was
not
a
dog
or
a
wolf
it
was
the
swift
as
the
sarcees
had
named
it
the
quickest
creature
in
the
wilderness
fangs
should
have
sunk
deep
in
its
jugular
but
in
a
fractional
part
of
a
second
the
lynx
had
thrown
itself
back
like
a
huge
soft
ball
and
kazan
teeth
buried
themselves
in
the
flesh
of
its
neck
instead
of
the
jugular
and
kazan
was
not
now
fighting
the
fangs
of
a
wolf
in
the
pack
or
of
another
husky
he
was
fighting
claws
claws
that
ripped
like
twenty
knives
and
which
even
a
jugular
hold
could
not
stop
once
he
had
fought
a
lynx
in
a
trap
and
he
had
not
forgotten
the
lesson
the
battle
had
taught
him
he
fought
to
pull
the
lynx
instead
of
forcing
it
on
its
back
as
he
would
have
done
with
another
dog
or
a
wolf
he
knew
that
when
on
its
back
the
fierce
cat
was
most
dangerous
one
rip
of
its
powerful
hindfeet
could
disembowel
him
behind
him
he
heard
gray
wolf
sobbing
and
crying
and
he
knew
that
she
was
terribly
hurt
he
was
filled
with
the
rage
and
strength
of
two
dogs
and
his
teeth
met
through
the
flesh
and
hide
of
the
cat
throat
but
the
big
lynx
escaped
death
by
half
an
inch
it
would
take
a
fresh
grip
to
reach
the
jugular
and
suddenly
kazan
made
the
deadly
lunge
there
was
an
instant
freedom
for
the
lynx
and
in
that
moment
it
flung
itself
back
and
kazan
gripped
at
its
throat
the
cat
claws
ripped
through
his
flesh
cutting
open
his
side
a
little
too
high
to
kill
another
stroke
and
they
would
have
cut
to
his
vitals
but
they
had
struggled
close
to
the
edge
of
the
rock
wall
and
suddenly
without
a
snarl
or
a
cry
they
rolled
over
it
was
fifty
or
sixty
feet
to
the
rocks
of
the
ledge
below
and
even
as
they
pitched
over
and
over
in
the
fall
kazan
teeth
sank
deeper
they
struck
with
terrific
force
kazan
uppermost
the
shock
sent
him
half
a
dozen
feet
from
his
enemy
he
was
up
like
a
flash
dizzy
snarling
on
the
defensive
the
lynx
lay
limp
and
motionless
where
it
had
fallen
kazan
came
nearer
still
prepared
and
sniffed
cautiously
something
told
him
that
the
fight
was
over
he
turned
and
dragged
himself
slowly
along
the
ledge
to
the
trail
and
returned
to
gray
wolf
gray
wolf
was
no
longer
in
the
moonlight
close
to
the
two
rocks
lay
the
limp
and
lifeless
little
bodies
of
the
three
pups
the
lynx
had
torn
them
to
pieces
with
a
whine
of
grief
kazan
approached
the
two
boulders
and
thrust
his
head
between
them
gray
wolf
was
there
crying
to
herself
in
that
terrible
sobbing
way
he
went
in
and
began
to
lick
her
bleeding
shoulders
and
head
all
the
rest
of
that
night
she
whimpered
with
pain
with
dawn
she
dragged
herself
out
to
the
lifeless
little
bodies
on
the
rock
and
then
kazan
saw
the
terrible
work
of
the
lynx
for
gray
wolf
was
blind
not
for
a
day
or
a
night
but
blind
for
all
time
a
gloom
that
no
sun
could
break
had
become
her
shroud
and
perhaps
again
it
was
that
instinct
of
animal
creation
which
often
is
more
wonderful
than
reason
that
told
kazan
what
had
happened
for
he
knew
now
that
she
was
helpless
more
helpless
than
the
little
creatures
that
had
gamboled
in
the
moonlight
a
few
hours
before
he
remained
close
beside
her
all
that
day
illustration
kazan
gripped
at
its
throat
vainly
that
day
did
joan
call
for
kazan
her
voice
rose
to
the
sun
rock
and
gray
wolf
head
snuggled
closer
to
kazan
and
kazan
ears
dropped
back
and
he
licked
her
wounds
late
in
the
afternoon
kazan
left
gray
wolf
long
enough
to
run
to
the
bottom
of
the
trail
and
bring
up
the
rabbit
gray
wolf
muzzled
the
fur
and
flesh
but
would
not
eat
still
a
little
later
kazan
urged
her
to
follow
him
to
the
trail
he
no
longer
wanted
to
stay
at
the
top
of
the
sun
rock
and
he
no
longer
wanted
gray
wolf
to
stay
there
step
by
step
he
drew
her
down
the
winding
path
away
from
her
dead
puppies
she
would
move
only
when
he
was
very
near
her
so
near
that
she
could
touch
his
scarred
flank
with
her
nose
they
came
at
last
to
the
point
in
the
trail
where
they
had
to
leap
down
a
distance
of
three
or
four
feet
from
the
edge
of
a
rock
and
here
kazan
saw
how
utterly
helpless
gray
wolf
had
become
she
whined
and
crouched
twenty
times
before
she
dared
make
the
spring
and
then
she
jumped
and
fell
in
a
heap
at
kazan
feet
after
this
kazan
did
not
have
to
urge
her
so
hard
for
the
fall
impinged
on
her
the
fact
that
she
was
safe
only
when
her
muzzle
touched
her
mate
flank
she
followed
him
obediently
when
they
reached
the
plain
trotting
with
her
foreshoulder
to
his
hip
kazan
was
heading
for
a
thicket
in
the
creek
bottom
half
a
mile
away
and
a
dozen
times
in
that
short
distance
gray
wolf
stumbled
and
fell
and
each
time
that
she
fell
kazan
learned
a
little
more
of
the
limitations
of
blindness
once
he
sprang
off
in
pursuit
of
a
rabbit
but
he
had
not
taken
twenty
leaps
when
he
stopped
and
looked
back
gray
wolf
had
not
moved
an
inch
she
stood
motionless
sniffing
the
air
waiting
for
him
for
a
full
minute
kazan
stood
also
waiting
then
he
returned
to
her
ever
after
this
he
returned
to
the
point
where
he
had
left
gray
wolf
knowing
that
he
would
find
her
there
all
that
day
they
remained
in
the
thicket
in
the
afternoon
he
visited
the
cabin
joan
and
her
husband
were
there
and
both
saw
at
once
kazan
torn
side
and
his
lacerated
head
and
shoulders
pretty
near
a
finish
fight
for
him
said
the
man
after
he
had
examined
him
it
was
either
a
lynx
or
a
bear
another
wolf
could
not
do
that
for
half
an
hour
joan
worked
over
him
talking
to
him
all
the
time
and
fondling
him
with
her
soft
hands
she
bathed
his
wounds
in
warm
water
and
then
covered
them
with
a
healing
salve
and
kazan
was
filled
again
with
that
old
restful
desire
to
remain
with
her
always
and
never
to
go
back
into
the
forests
for
an
hour
she
let
him
lie
on
the
edge
of
her
dress
with
his
nose
touching
her
foot
while
she
worked
on
baby
things
then
she
rose
to
prepare
supper
and
kazan
got
up
a
little
wearily
and
went
to
the
door
gray
wolf
and
the
gloom
of
the
night
were
calling
him
and
he
answered
that
call
with
a
slouch
of
his
shoulders
and
a
drooping
head
its
old
thrill
was
gone
he
watched
his
chance
and
went
out
through
the
door
the
moon
had
risen
when
he
rejoined
gray
wolf
she
greeted
his
return
with
a
low
whine
of
joy
and
muzzled
him
with
her
blind
face
in
her
helplessness
she
looked
happier
than
kazan
in
all
his
strength
from
now
on
during
the
days
that
followed
it
was
a
last
great
fight
between
blind
and
faithful
gray
wolf
and
the
woman
if
joan
had
known
of
what
lay
in
the
thicket
if
she
could
once
have
seen
the
poor
creature
to
whom
kazan
was
now
all
life
the
sun
the
stars
the
moon
and
food
she
would
have
helped
gray
wolf
but
as
it
was
she
tried
to
lure
kazan
more
and
more
to
the
cabin
and
slowly
she
won
at
last
the
great
day
came
eight
days
after
the
fight
on
the
sun
rock
kazan
had
taken
gray
wolf
to
a
wooded
point
on
the
river
two
days
before
and
there
he
had
left
her
the
preceding
night
when
he
went
to
the
cabin
this
time
a
stout
babiche
thong
was
tied
to
the
collar
round
his
neck
and
he
was
fastened
to
a
staple
in
the
log
wall
joan
and
her
husband
were
up
before
it
was
light
next
day
the
sun
was
just
rising
when
they
all
went
out
the
man
carrying
the
baby
and
joan
leading
him
joan
turned
and
locked
the
cabin
door
and
kazan
heard
a
sob
in
her
throat
as
they
followed
the
man
down
to
the
river
the
big
canoe
was
packed
and
waiting
joan
got
in
first
with
the
baby
then
still
holding
the
babiche
thong
she
drew
kazan
up
close
to
her
so
that
he
lay
with
his
weight
against
her
the
sun
fell
warmly
on
kazan
back
as
they
shoved
off
and
he
closed
his
eyes
and
rested
his
head
on
joan
lap
her
hand
fell
softly
on
his
shoulder
he
heard
again
that
sound
which
the
man
could
not
hear
the
broken
sob
in
her
throat
as
the
canoe
moved
slowly
down
to
the
wooded
point
joan
waved
her
hand
back
at
the
cabin
just
disappearing
behind
the
trees
she
cried
sadly
and
then
she
buried
her
face
close
down
to
kazan
and
the
baby
and
sobbed
the
man
stopped
paddling
you
not
sorry
joan
he
asked
they
were
drifting
past
the
point
now
and
the
scent
of
gray
wolf
came
to
kazan
nostrils
rousing
him
and
bringing
a
low
whine
from
his
throat
you
not
sorry
we
going
joan
shook
her
head
no
she
replied
only
i
always
lived
here
in
the
forests
and
they
home
the
point
with
its
white
finger
of
sand
was
behind
them
now
and
kazan
was
standing
rigid
facing
it
the
man
called
to
him
and
joan
lifted
her
head
she
too
saw
the
point
and
suddenly
the
babiche
leash
slipped
from
her
fingers
and
a
strange
light
leaped
into
her
blue
eyes
as
she
saw
what
stood
at
the
end
of
that
white
tip
of
sand
it
was
gray
wolf
her
blind
eyes
were
turned
toward
kazan
at
last
gray
wolf
the
faithful
understood
scent
told
her
what
her
eyes
could
not
see
kazan
and
the
were
together
and
they
were
going
going
going
look
whispered
joan
the
man
turned
gray
wolf
forefeet
were
in
the
water
and
now
as
the
canoe
drifted
farther
and
farther
away
she
settled
back
on
her
haunches
raised
her
head
to
the
sun
which
she
could
not
see
and
gave
her
last
long
wailing
cry
for
kazan
the
canoe
lurched
a
tawny
body
shot
through
the
air
and
kazan
was
gone
the
man
reached
forward
for
his
rifle
joan
hand
stopped
him
her
face
was
white
let
him
go
back
to
her
let
him
go
let
him
go
she
cried
it
is
his
place
with
her
and
kazan
reaching
the
shore
shook
the
water
from
his
shaggy
hair
and
looked
for
the
last
time
toward
the
woman
the
canoe
was
drifting
slowly
around
the
first
bend
a
moment
more
and
it
had
disappeared
gray
wolf
had
won
chapter
x
the
days
of
fire
from
the
night
of
the
terrible
fight
with
the
big
gray
lynx
on
the
top
of
the
sun
rock
kazan
remembered
less
and
less
vividly
the
old
days
when
he
had
been
a
and
the
leader
of
a
pack
he
would
never
quite
forget
them
and
always
there
would
stand
out
certain
memories
from
among
the
rest
like
fires
cutting
the
blackness
of
night
but
as
man
dates
events
from
his
birth
his
marriage
his
freedom
from
a
bondage
or
some
in
his
career
so
all
things
seemed
to
kazan
to
begin
with
two
tragedies
which
had
followed
one
fast
upon
the
other
after
the
birth
of
gray
wolf
pups
the
first
was
the
fight
on
the
sun
rock
when
the
big
gray
lynx
had
blinded
his
beautiful
wolf
mate
for
all
time
and
had
torn
her
pups
into
pieces
he
in
turn
had
killed
the
lynx
but
gray
wolf
was
still
blind
vengeance
had
not
been
able
to
give
her
sight
she
could
no
longer
hunt
with
him
as
they
had
hunted
with
the
wild
out
on
the
plain
and
in
the
dark
forests
so
at
thought
of
that
night
he
always
snarled
and
his
lips
curled
back
to
reveal
his
fangs
the
other
tragedy
was
the
going
of
joan
her
baby
and
her
husband
something
more
infallible
than
reason
told
kazan
that
they
would
not
come
back
brightest
of
all
the
pictures
that
remained
with
him
was
that
of
the
sunny
morning
when
the
woman
and
the
baby
he
loved
and
the
man
he
endured
because
of
them
had
gone
away
in
the
canoe
and
often
he
would
go
to
the
point
and
gaze
longingly
where
he
had
leaped
from
the
canoe
to
return
to
his
blind
mate
so
kazan
life
seemed
now
to
be
made
up
chiefly
of
three
things
his
hatred
of
everything
that
bore
the
scent
or
mark
of
the
lynx
his
grieving
for
joan
and
the
baby
and
gray
wolf
it
was
natural
that
the
strongest
passion
in
him
should
be
his
hatred
of
the
lynx
for
not
only
gray
wolf
blindness
and
the
death
of
the
pups
but
even
the
loss
of
the
woman
and
the
baby
he
laid
to
that
fatal
struggle
on
the
sun
rock
from
that
hour
he
became
the
deadliest
enemy
of
the
lynx
tribe
wherever
he
struck
the
scent
of
the
big
gray
cat
he
was
turned
into
a
snarling
demon
and
his
hatred
grew
day
by
day
as
he
became
more
completely
a
part
of
the
wild
he
found
that
gray
wolf
was
more
necessary
to
him
now
than
she
had
ever
been
since
the
day
she
had
left
the
for
him
he
was
dog
and
the
of
him
demanded
companionship
there
was
only
gray
wolf
to
give
him
that
now
they
were
alone
civilization
was
four
hundred
miles
south
of
them
the
nearest
bay
post
was
sixty
miles
to
the
west
often
in
the
days
of
the
woman
and
the
baby
gray
wolf
had
spent
her
nights
alone
out
in
the
forest
waiting
and
calling
for
kazan
now
it
was
kazan
who
was
lonely
and
uneasy
when
he
was
away
from
her
side
in
her
blindness
gray
wolf
could
no
longer
hunt
with
her
mate
but
gradually
a
new
code
of
understanding
grew
up
between
them
and
through
her
blindness
they
learned
many
things
that
they
had
not
known
before
by
early
summer
gray
wolf
could
travel
with
kazan
if
he
did
not
move
too
swiftly
she
ran
at
his
flank
with
her
shoulder
or
muzzle
touching
him
and
kazan
learned
not
to
leap
but
to
trot
very
quickly
he
found
that
he
must
choose
the
easiest
trails
for
gray
wolf
feet
when
they
came
to
a
space
to
be
bridged
by
a
leap
he
would
muzzle
gray
wolf
and
whine
and
she
would
stand
with
ears
alert
listening
then
kazan
would
take
the
leap
and
she
understood
the
distance
she
had
to
cover
she
always
which
was
a
good
fault
in
another
way
and
one
that
was
destined
to
serve
them
many
times
in
the
future
she
became
of
greater
help
than
ever
to
kazan
scent
and
hearing
entirely
took
the
place
of
sight
each
day
developed
these
senses
more
and
more
and
at
the
same
time
there
developed
between
them
the
dumb
language
whereby
she
could
impress
upon
kazan
what
she
had
discovered
by
scent
or
sound
it
became
a
curious
habit
of
always
to
look
at
gray
wolf
when
they
stopped
to
listen
or
to
scent
the
air
after
the
fight
on
the
sun
rock
kazan
had
taken
his
blind
mate
to
a
thick
clump
of
spruce
and
balsam
in
the
where
they
remained
until
early
summer
every
day
for
weeks
kazan
went
to
the
cabin
where
joan
and
the
baby
and
the
man
had
been
for
a
long
time
he
went
hopefully
looking
each
day
or
night
to
see
some
sign
of
life
there
but
the
door
was
never
open
the
boards
and
saplings
at
the
windows
always
remained
never
a
spiral
of
smoke
rose
from
the
clay
chimney
grass
and
vines
began
to
grow
in
the
path
and
fainter
and
fainter
grew
that
scent
which
kazan
could
still
find
about
it
the
scent
of
man
of
the
woman
the
baby
one
day
he
found
a
little
baby
moccasin
under
one
of
the
closed
windows
it
was
old
and
worn
out
and
blackened
by
snow
and
rain
but
he
lay
down
beside
it
and
remained
there
for
a
long
time
while
the
baby
joan
a
thousand
miles
away
was
playing
with
the
strange
toys
of
civilization
then
he
returned
to
gray
wolf
among
the
spruce
and
balsam
the
cabin
was
the
one
place
to
which
gray
wolf
would
not
follow
him
at
all
other
times
she
was
at
his
side
now
that
she
had
become
accustomed
to
blindness
she
even
accompanied
him
on
his
hunts
until
he
struck
game
and
began
the
chase
then
she
would
wait
for
him
kazan
usually
hunted
the
big
rabbits
but
one
night
he
ran
down
and
killed
a
young
doe
the
kill
was
too
heavy
to
drag
to
gray
wolf
so
he
returned
to
where
she
was
waiting
for
him
and
guided
her
to
the
feast
in
many
ways
they
became
more
and
more
inseparable
as
the
summer
lengthened
until
at
last
through
all
the
wilderness
their
footprints
were
always
two
by
two
and
never
one
by
one
then
came
the
great
fire
gray
wolf
caught
the
scent
of
it
when
it
was
still
two
days
to
the
west
the
sun
that
night
went
down
in
a
lurid
cloud
the
moon
drifting
into
the
west
became
blood
red
when
it
dropped
behind
the
wilderness
in
this
manner
the
indians
called
it
the
bleeding
moon
and
the
air
was
filled
with
omens
all
the
next
day
gray
wolf
was
nervous
and
toward
noon
kazan
caught
in
the
air
the
warning
that
she
had
sensed
many
hours
ahead
of
him
steadily
the
scent
grew
stronger
and
by
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
the
sun
was
veiled
by
a
film
of
smoke
the
flight
of
the
wild
things
from
the
triangle
of
forest
between
the
junctions
of
the
pipestone
and
cree
rivers
would
have
begun
then
but
the
wind
shifted
it
was
a
fatal
shift
the
fire
was
raging
from
the
west
and
south
then
the
wind
swept
straight
eastward
carrying
the
smoke
with
it
and
during
this
breathing
spell
all
the
wild
creatures
in
the
triangle
between
the
two
rivers
waited
this
gave
the
fire
time
to
sweep
completely
across
the
base
of
the
forest
triangle
cutting
off
the
last
trails
of
escape
then
the
wind
shifted
again
and
the
fire
swept
north
the
head
of
the
triangle
became
a
all
through
the
night
the
southern
sky
was
filled
with
a
lurid
glow
and
by
morning
the
heat
and
smoke
and
ash
were
suffocating
kazan
searched
vainly
for
a
means
of
escape
not
for
an
instant
did
he
leave
gray
wolf
it
would
have
been
easy
for
him
to
swim
across
either
of
the
two
streams
for
he
was
dog
but
at
the
first
touch
of
water
on
her
paws
gray
wolf
drew
back
shrinking
like
all
her
breed
she
would
face
fire
and
death
before
water
kazan
urged
a
dozen
times
he
leaped
in
and
swam
out
into
the
stream
but
gray
wolf
would
come
no
farther
than
she
could
wade
they
could
hear
the
distant
murmuring
roar
of
the
fire
now
ahead
of
it
came
the
wild
things
moose
caribou
and
deer
plunged
into
the
water
of
the
streams
and
swam
to
the
safety
of
the
opposite
side
out
upon
a
white
finger
of
sand
lumbered
a
big
black
bear
with
two
cubs
and
even
the
cubs
took
to
the
water
and
swam
across
easily
kazan
watched
them
and
whined
to
gray
wolf
and
then
out
upon
that
white
finger
of
sand
came
other
things
that
dreaded
the
water
as
gray
wolf
dreaded
it
a
big
fat
porcupine
a
sleek
little
marten
a
that
sniffed
the
air
and
wailed
like
a
child
those
things
that
could
not
or
would
not
swim
outnumbered
the
others
three
to
one
hundreds
of
little
ermine
scurried
along
the
shore
like
rats
their
squeaking
little
voices
sounding
incessantly
foxes
ran
swiftly
along
the
banks
seeking
a
tree
or
a
windfall
that
might
bridge
the
water
for
them
the
lynx
snarled
and
faced
the
fire
and
gray
wolf
own
tribe
the
wolves
dared
take
no
deeper
step
than
she
dripping
and
panting
and
half
choked
by
heat
and
smoke
kazan
came
to
gray
wolf
side
there
was
but
one
refuge
left
near
them
and
that
was
the
it
reached
out
for
fifty
feet
into
the
stream
quickly
he
led
his
blind
mate
toward
it
as
they
came
through
the
low
bush
to
the
something
stopped
them
both
to
their
nostrils
had
come
the
scent
of
a
deadlier
enemy
than
fire
a
lynx
had
taken
possession
of
the
and
was
crouching
at
the
end
of
it
three
porcupines
had
dragged
themselves
into
the
edge
of
the
water
and
lay
there
like
balls
their
quills
alert
and
quivering
a
was
snarling
at
the
lynx
and
the
lynx
with
ears
laid
back
watched
kazan
and
gray
wolf
as
they
began
the
invasion
of
the
faithful
gray
wolf
was
full
of
fight
and
she
sprang
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
kazan
her
fangs
bared
with
an
angry
snap
kazan
drove
her
back
and
she
stood
quivering
and
whining
while
he
advanced
his
pointed
ears
forward
no
menace
or
threat
in
his
attitude
he
advanced
it
was
the
deadly
advance
of
the
husky
trained
in
battle
skilled
in
the
art
of
killing
a
man
from
civilization
would
have
said
that
the
dog
was
approaching
the
lynx
with
friendly
intentions
but
the
lynx
understood
it
was
the
old
feud
of
many
generations
made
deadlier
now
by
kazan
memory
of
that
night
at
the
top
of
the
sun
rock
instinct
told
the
what
was
coming
and
it
crouched
low
and
flat
the
porcupines
scolding
like
little
children
at
the
presence
of
enemies
and
the
thickening
clouds
of
smoke
thrust
their
quills
still
more
erect
the
lynx
lay
on
its
belly
like
a
cat
its
hindquarters
twitching
and
gathered
for
the
spring
kazan
feet
seemed
scarcely
to
touch
the
sand
as
he
circled
lightly
around
it
the
lynx
pivoted
as
he
circled
and
then
it
shot
in
a
round
snarling
ball
over
the
eight
feet
of
space
that
separated
them
kazan
did
not
leap
aside
he
made
no
effort
to
escape
the
attack
but
met
it
fairly
with
the
full
force
of
his
shoulders
as
meets
he
was
ten
pounds
heavier
than
the
lynx
and
for
a
moment
the
big
cat
with
its
twenty
claws
was
thrown
on
its
side
like
a
flash
kazan
took
advantage
of
the
moment
and
drove
for
the
back
of
the
cat
neck
in
that
same
moment
blind
gray
wolf
leaped
in
with
a
snarling
cry
and
fighting
under
kazan
belly
she
fastened
her
jaws
in
one
of
the
hindlegs
the
bone
snapped
the
lynx
twice
outweighed
leaped
backward
dragging
both
kazan
and
gray
wolf
it
fell
back
down
on
one
of
the
porcupines
and
a
hundred
quills
drove
into
its
body
another
leap
and
it
was
free
fleeing
into
the
face
of
the
smoke
kazan
did
not
pursue
gray
wolf
came
to
his
side
and
licked
his
neck
where
fresh
blood
was
crimsoning
his
tawny
hide
the
lay
as
if
dead
watching
them
with
fierce
little
black
eyes
the
porcupines
continued
to
chatter
as
if
begging
for
mercy
and
then
a
thick
black
suffocating
pall
of
smoke
drove
low
over
the
and
with
it
came
air
that
was
at
the
uttermost
end
of
the
kazan
and
gray
wolf
rolled
themselves
into
balls
and
thrust
their
heads
under
their
bodies
the
fire
was
very
near
now
the
roar
of
it
was
like
that
of
a
great
cataract
with
now
and
then
a
louder
crash
of
falling
trees
the
air
was
filled
with
ash
and
burning
sparks
and
twice
kazan
drew
forth
his
head
to
snap
at
blazing
embers
that
fell
upon
and
seared
him
like
hot
irons
close
along
the
edge
of
the
stream
grew
thick
green
bush
and
when
the
fire
reached
this
it
burned
more
slowly
and
the
heat
grew
less
still
it
was
a
long
time
before
kazan
and
gray
wolf
could
draw
forth
their
heads
and
breathe
more
freely
then
they
found
that
the
finger
of
sand
reaching
out
into
the
river
had
saved
them
everywhere
in
that
triangle
between
the
two
rivers
the
world
had
turned
black
and
was
hot
underfoot
the
smoke
cleared
away
the
wind
changed
again
and
swung
down
cool
and
fresh
from
the
west
and
north
the
was
the
first
to
move
cautiously
back
to
the
forests
that
had
been
but
the
porcupines
were
still
rolled
into
balls
when
gray
wolf
and
kazan
left
the
they
began
to
travel
and
before
night
came
their
feet
were
sore
from
hot
ash
and
burning
embers
the
moon
was
strange
and
foreboding
that
night
like
a
spatter
of
blood
in
the
sky
and
through
the
long
silent
hours
there
was
not
even
the
hoot
of
an
owl
to
give
a
sign
that
life
still
existed
where
yesterday
had
been
a
paradise
of
wild
things
kazan
knew
that
there
was
nothing
to
hunt
and
they
continued
to
travel
all
that
night
with
dawn
they
struck
a
narrow
swamp
along
the
edge
of
the
stream
here
beavers
had
built
a
dam
and
they
were
able
to
cross
over
into
the
green
country
on
the
opposite
side
for
another
day
and
another
night
they
traveled
westward
and
this
brought
them
into
the
thick
country
of
swamp
and
timber
along
the
waterfound
and
as
kazan
and
gray
wolf
came
from
the
west
there
came
from
the
hudson
bay
post
to
the
east
a
slim
french
by
the
name
of
henri
loti
the
most
famous
lynx
hunter
in
all
the
hudson
bay
country
he
was
prospecting
for
signs
and
he
found
them
in
abundance
along
the
waterfound
it
was
a
game
paradise
and
the
rabbit
abounded
in
thousands
as
a
consequence
the
lynxes
were
thick
and
henri
built
his
trapping
shack
and
then
returned
to
the
post
to
wait
until
the
first
snows
fell
when
he
would
come
back
with
his
team
supplies
and
traps
and
up
from
the
south
at
this
same
time
there
was
slowly
working
his
way
by
canoe
and
trail
a
young
university
zoologist
who
was
gathering
material
for
a
book
on
reasoning
of
the
his
name
was
paul
weyman
and
he
had
made
arrangements
to
spend
a
part
of
the
winter
with
henri
loti
the
he
brought
with
him
plenty
of
paper
a
camera
and
the
photograph
of
a
girl
his
only
weapon
was
a
and
meanwhile
kazan
and
gray
wolf
found
the
home
they
were
seeking
in
a
thick
swamp
five
or
six
miles
from
the
cabin
that
henri
loti
had
built
chapter
xi
always
two
by
two
it
was
january
when
a
guide
from
the
post
brought
paul
weyman
to
henri
loti
cabin
on
the
waterfound
he
was
a
man
of
or
three
full
of
the
life
that
made
henri
like
him
at
once
if
this
had
not
been
the
case
the
first
few
days
in
the
cabin
might
have
been
unpleasant
for
henri
was
in
bad
humor
he
told
weyman
about
it
their
first
night
as
they
were
smoking
pipes
alongside
the
redly
glowing
box
stove
it
is
damn
strange
said
henri
i
have
lost
seven
lynx
in
the
traps
torn
to
pieces
like
they
were
no
more
than
rabbits
that
the
foxes
had
killed
no
thing
not
even
bear
have
ever
tackled
lynx
in
a
trap
before
it
is
the
first
time
i
ever
see
it
and
they
are
torn
up
so
bad
they
are
not
worth
one
half
dollar
at
the
post
seven
that
is
over
two
hundred
dollar
i
have
lost
there
are
two
wolves
who
do
it
two
i
know
it
by
the
tracks
always
two
an
never
one
they
follow
my
an
eat
the
rabbits
i
catch
they
leave
the
an
the
mink
an
the
ermine
an
the
marten
but
the
lynx
an
damn
they
jump
on
him
an
pull
the
fur
from
him
like
you
pull
the
wild
cotton
balls
from
the
i
have
tried
strychnine
in
deer
fat
an
i
have
set
traps
and
deadfalls
but
i
can
not
catch
them
they
will
drive
me
out
unless
i
get
them
for
i
have
taken
only
five
good
lynx
an
they
have
destroyed
seven
this
roused
weyman
he
was
one
of
that
growing
number
of
thoughtful
men
who
believe
that
man
egoism
as
a
race
blinds
him
to
many
of
the
more
wonderful
facts
of
creation
he
had
thrown
down
the
gantlet
and
with
a
logic
that
had
gained
him
a
hearing
to
those
who
believed
that
man
was
the
only
living
creature
who
could
reason
and
that
common
sense
and
cleverness
when
displayed
by
any
other
breathing
thing
were
merely
instinct
the
facts
behind
henri
tale
of
woe
struck
him
as
important
and
until
midnight
they
talked
about
the
two
strange
wolves
there
is
one
big
wolf
an
one
smaller
said
henri
an
it
is
always
the
big
wolf
who
goes
in
an
fights
the
lynx
i
see
that
by
the
snow
while
he
fighting
the
smaller
wolf
makes
many
tracks
in
the
snow
just
out
of
reach
an
then
when
the
lynx
is
down
or
dead
it
jumps
in
helps
tear
it
into
pieces
all
that
i
know
by
the
snow
only
once
have
i
seen
where
the
smaller
one
went
in
an
fought
with
the
other
an
then
there
was
blood
all
about
that
was
not
lynx
blood
i
trailed
the
devils
a
mile
by
the
dripping
during
the
two
weeks
that
followed
weyman
found
much
to
add
to
the
material
of
his
book
not
a
day
passed
that
somewhere
along
they
did
not
see
the
trails
of
the
two
wolves
and
weyman
observed
that
as
henri
had
told
him
the
footprints
were
always
two
by
two
and
never
one
by
one
on
the
third
day
they
came
to
a
trap
that
had
held
a
lynx
and
at
sight
of
what
remained
henri
cursed
in
both
french
and
english
until
he
was
purple
in
the
face
the
lynx
had
been
torn
until
its
pelt
was
practically
worthless
weyman
saw
where
the
smaller
wolf
had
waited
on
its
haunches
while
its
companion
had
killed
the
lynx
he
did
not
tell
henri
all
he
thought
but
the
days
that
followed
convinced
him
more
and
more
that
he
had
found
the
most
dramatic
exemplification
of
his
theory
back
of
this
mysterious
tragedy
of
the
there
was
a
why
did
the
two
wolves
not
destroy
the
the
ermine
and
the
marten
why
was
their
feud
with
the
lynx
alone
weyman
was
strangely
thrilled
he
was
a
lover
of
wild
things
and
for
that
reason
he
never
carried
a
gun
and
when
he
saw
henri
placing
for
the
two
marauders
he
shuddered
and
when
day
after
day
he
saw
that
these
were
untouched
he
rejoiced
something
in
his
own
nature
went
out
in
sympathy
to
the
heroic
outlaw
of
the
who
never
failed
to
give
battle
to
the
lynx
nights
in
the
cabin
he
wrote
down
his
thoughts
and
discoveries
of
the
day
one
night
he
turned
suddenly
on
henri
henri
does
it
ever
make
you
sorry
to
kill
so
many
wild
things
he
asked
henri
stared
and
shook
his
head
i
kill
an
he
said
i
kill
more
and
there
are
twenty
thousand
others
just
like
you
in
this
northern
quarter
of
the
continent
all
killing
killing
for
hundreds
of
years
back
and
yet
you
ca
kill
out
wild
life
the
war
of
man
and
the
beast
you
might
call
it
and
if
you
could
return
five
hundred
years
from
now
henri
you
still
find
wild
life
here
nearly
all
the
rest
of
the
world
is
changing
but
you
ca
change
these
almost
impenetrable
thousands
of
square
miles
of
ridges
and
swamps
and
forests
the
railroads
wo
come
here
and
i
for
one
thank
god
for
that
take
all
the
great
prairies
to
the
west
for
instance
why
the
old
buffalo
trails
are
still
there
plain
as
day
and
yet
towns
and
cities
are
growing
up
everywhere
did
you
ever
hear
of
north
battleford
is
she
near
montreal
or
quebec
henri
asked
weyman
smiled
and
drew
a
photograph
from
his
pocket
it
was
the
picture
of
a
girl
no
it
far
to
the
west
in
saskatchewan
seven
years
ago
i
used
to
go
up
there
every
year
to
shoot
prairie
chickens
coyotes
and
elk
there
was
any
north
battleford
then
just
the
glorious
prairie
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
square
miles
of
it
there
was
a
single
shack
on
the
saskatchewan
river
where
north
battleford
now
stands
and
i
used
to
stay
there
in
that
shack
there
was
a
little
girl
twelve
years
old
we
used
to
go
out
hunting
together
for
i
used
to
kill
things
in
those
days
and
the
little
girl
would
cry
sometimes
when
i
killed
and
laugh
at
her
then
a
railroad
came
and
then
another
and
they
joined
near
the
shack
and
all
at
once
a
town
sprang
up
seven
years
ago
there
was
only
the
shack
there
henri
two
years
ago
there
were
eighteen
hundred
people
this
year
when
i
came
through
there
were
five
thousand
and
two
years
from
now
there
be
ten
thousand
on
the
ground
where
that
shack
stood
are
three
banks
with
a
capital
of
forty
million
dollars
you
can
see
the
glow
of
the
electric
lights
of
the
city
twenty
miles
away
it
has
a
dollar
college
a
high
school
the
provincial
asylum
a
fire
department
two
clubs
a
board
of
trade
and
it
going
to
have
a
line
within
two
years
think
of
that
all
where
the
coyotes
howled
a
few
years
ago
people
are
coming
in
so
fast
that
they
ca
keep
a
census
five
years
from
now
there
be
a
city
of
twenty
thousand
where
the
old
shack
stood
and
the
little
girl
in
that
shack
henri
she
a
young
lady
now
and
her
people
are
well
rich
i
do
care
about
that
the
chief
thing
is
that
she
is
going
to
marry
me
in
the
spring
because
of
her
i
stopped
killing
things
when
she
was
only
sixteen
the
last
thing
i
killed
was
a
prairie
wolf
and
it
had
young
eileen
kept
the
little
puppy
she
got
it
now
tamed
that
why
above
all
other
wild
things
i
love
the
wolves
and
i
hope
these
two
leave
your
safe
henri
was
staring
at
him
weyman
gave
him
the
picture
it
was
of
a
girl
with
deep
pure
eyes
and
there
came
a
twitch
at
the
corners
of
henri
mouth
as
he
looked
at
it
my
iowaka
died
year
ago
he
said
she
too
loved
the
wild
thing
but
them
wolf
damn
they
drive
me
out
if
i
can
not
kill
them
he
put
fresh
fuel
into
the
stove
and
prepared
for
bed
one
day
the
big
idea
came
to
henri
weyman
was
with
him
when
they
struck
fresh
signs
of
lynx
there
was
a
great
windfall
ten
or
fifteen
feet
high
and
in
one
place
the
logs
had
formed
a
sort
of
cavern
with
almost
solid
walls
on
three
sides
the
snow
was
beaten
down
by
tracks
and
the
fur
of
rabbit
was
scattered
about
henri
was
jubilant
we
got
heem
sure
he
said
he
built
the
set
a
trap
and
looked
about
him
shrewdly
then
he
explained
his
scheme
to
weyman
if
the
lynx
was
caught
and
the
two
wolves
came
to
destroy
it
the
fight
would
take
place
in
that
shelter
under
the
windfall
and
the
marauders
would
have
to
pass
through
the
opening
so
henri
set
five
smaller
traps
concealing
them
skilfully
under
leaves
and
moss
and
snow
and
all
were
far
enough
away
from
the
so
that
the
trapped
lynx
could
not
spring
them
in
his
struggles
when
they
fight
wolf
jump
this
way
an
that
an
sure
get
in
said
henri
he
miss
one
two
but
he
sure
get
in
trap
somewhere
that
same
morning
a
light
snow
fell
making
the
work
more
complete
for
it
covered
up
all
footprints
and
buried
the
telltale
scent
of
man
that
night
kazan
and
gray
wolf
passed
within
a
hundred
feet
of
the
windfall
and
gray
wolf
keen
scent
detected
something
strange
and
disquieting
in
the
air
she
informed
kazan
by
pressing
her
shoulder
against
his
and
they
swung
off
at
right
angles
keeping
to
windward
of
the
for
two
days
and
three
cold
starlit
nights
nothing
happened
at
the
windfall
henri
understood
and
explained
to
weyman
the
lynx
was
a
hunter
like
himself
and
also
had
its
which
it
covered
about
once
a
week
on
the
fifth
night
the
lynx
returned
went
to
the
windfall
was
lured
straight
to
the
bait
and
the
steel
trap
closed
relentlessly
over
its
right
hindfoot
kazan
and
gray
wolf
were
traveling
a
quarter
of
a
mile
deeper
in
the
forest
when
they
heard
the
clanking
of
the
steel
chain
as
the
lynx
fought
to
free
itself
ten
minutes
later
they
stood
in
the
door
of
the
windfall
cavern
it
was
a
white
clear
night
so
filled
with
brilliant
stars
that
henri
himself
could
have
hunted
by
the
light
of
them
the
lynx
had
exhausted
itself
and
lay
crouching
on
its
belly
as
kazan
and
gray
wolf
appeared
as
usual
gray
wolf
held
back
while
kazan
began
the
battle
in
the
first
or
second
of
these
fights
on
the
kazan
would
probably
have
been
disemboweled
or
had
his
jugular
vein
cut
open
had
the
fierce
cats
been
free
they
were
more
than
his
match
in
open
fight
though
the
biggest
of
them
fell
ten
pounds
under
his
weight
chance
had
saved
him
on
the
sun
rock
gray
wolf
and
the
porcupine
had
both
added
to
the
defeat
of
the
lynx
on
the
and
along
henri
hunting
line
it
was
the
trap
that
was
his
ally
even
with
his
enemy
thus
shackled
he
took
big
chances
and
he
took
bigger
chances
than
ever
with
the
lynx
under
the
windfall
the
cat
was
an
old
warrior
six
or
seven
years
old
his
claws
were
an
inch
and
a
quarter
long
and
curved
like
simitars
his
forefeet
and
his
left
hindfoot
were
free
and
as
kazan
advanced
he
drew
back
so
that
the
was
slack
under
his
body
here
kazan
could
not
follow
his
old
tactics
of
circling
about
his
trapped
foe
until
it
had
become
tangled
in
the
chain
or
had
so
shortened
and
twisted
it
that
there
was
no
chance
for
a
leap
he
had
to
attack
face
to
face
and
suddenly
he
lunged
in
they
met
shoulder
to
shoulder
kazan
fangs
snapped
at
the
other
throat
and
missed
before
he
could
strike
again
the
lynx
flung
out
its
free
hindfoot
and
even
gray
wolf
heard
the
ripping
sound
that
it
made
with
a
snarl
kazan
was
flung
back
his
shoulder
torn
to
the
bone
then
it
was
that
one
of
henri
hidden
traps
saved
him
from
a
second
attack
and
death
steel
jaws
snapped
over
one
of
his
forefeet
and
when
he
leaped
the
chain
stopped
him
once
or
twice
before
blind
gray
wolf
had
leaped
in
when
she
knew
that
kazan
was
in
great
danger
for
an
instant
she
forgot
her
caution
now
and
as
she
heard
kazan
snarl
of
pain
she
sprang
in
under
the
windfall
five
traps
henri
had
hidden
in
the
space
in
front
of
the
and
gray
wolf
feet
found
two
of
these
she
fell
on
her
side
snapping
and
snarling
in
his
struggles
kazan
sprung
the
remaining
two
traps
one
of
them
missed
the
fifth
and
last
caught
him
by
a
hindfoot
this
was
a
little
past
midnight
from
then
until
morning
the
earth
and
snow
under
the
windfall
were
torn
up
by
the
struggles
of
the
wolf
the
dog
and
the
lynx
to
regain
their
freedom
and
when
morning
came
all
three
were
exhausted
and
lay
on
their
sides
panting
and
with
bleeding
jaws
waiting
for
the
coming
of
man
and
death
henri
and
weyman
were
out
early
when
they
struck
off
the
main
line
toward
the
windfall
henri
pointed
to
the
tracks
of
kazan
and
gray
wolf
and
his
dark
face
lighted
up
with
pleasure
and
excitement
when
they
reached
the
shelter
under
the
mass
of
fallen
timber
both
stood
speechless
for
a
moment
astounded
by
what
they
saw
even
henri
had
seen
nothing
like
this
before
two
wolves
and
a
lynx
all
in
traps
and
almost
within
reach
of
one
another
fangs
but
surprise
could
not
long
delay
the
business
of
henri
hunter
instinct
the
wolves
lay
first
in
his
path
and
he
was
raising
his
rifle
to
put
a
bullet
through
the
base
of
kazan
brain
when
weyman
caught
him
eagerly
by
the
arm
weyman
was
staring
his
fingers
dug
into
henri
flesh
his
eyes
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
collar
about
kazan
neck
wait
he
cried
it
not
a
wolf
it
a
dog
henri
lowered
his
rifle
staring
at
the
collar
weyman
eyes
shot
to
gray
wolf
she
was
facing
them
snarling
her
white
fangs
bared
to
the
foes
she
could
not
see
her
blind
eyes
were
closed
where
there
should
have
been
eyes
there
was
only
hair
and
an
exclamation
broke
from
weyman
lips
look
he
commanded
of
henri
what
in
the
name
of
heaven
one
is
dog
wild
dog
that
has
run
to
the
wolves
said
henri
and
the
other
is
wolf
and
gasped
weyman
blind
added
henri
falling
partly
into
french
in
his
amazement
he
was
raising
his
rifle
again
weyman
seized
it
firmly
illustration
wait
it
not
a
wolf
do
kill
them
henri
he
said
give
them
to
me
alive
figure
up
the
value
of
the
lynx
they
have
destroyed
and
add
to
that
the
wolf
bounty
and
i
will
pay
alive
they
are
worth
to
me
a
great
deal
my
god
a
dog
and
a
blind
wolf
he
still
held
henri
rifle
and
henri
was
staring
at
him
as
if
he
did
not
yet
quite
understand
weyman
continued
speaking
his
eyes
and
face
blazing
a
dog
and
a
blind
wolf
he
repeated
it
is
wonderful
henri
down
there
they
will
say
i
have
gone
beyond
when
my
book
comes
out
but
i
shall
have
proof
i
shall
take
twenty
photographs
here
before
you
kill
the
lynx
i
shall
keep
the
dog
and
the
wolf
alive
and
i
shall
pay
you
henri
a
hundred
dollars
apiece
for
the
two
may
i
have
them
henri
nodded
he
held
his
rifle
in
readiness
while
weyman
unpacked
his
camera
and
got
to
work
snarling
fangs
greeted
the
click
of
the
the
fangs
of
wolf
and
lynx
but
kazan
lay
cringing
not
through
fear
but
because
he
still
recognized
the
mastery
of
man
and
when
he
had
finished
with
his
pictures
weyman
approached
almost
within
reach
of
him
and
spoke
even
more
kindly
to
him
than
the
man
who
had
lived
back
in
the
deserted
cabin
henri
shot
the
lynx
and
when
kazan
understood
this
he
tore
at
the
end
of
his
and
snarled
at
the
writhing
body
of
his
forest
enemy
by
means
of
a
pole
and
a
babiche
noose
kazan
was
brought
out
from
under
the
windfall
and
taken
to
henri
cabin
the
two
men
then
returned
with
a
thick
sack
and
more
babiche
and
blind
gray
wolf
still
fettered
by
the
traps
was
made
prisoner
all
the
rest
of
that
day
weyman
and
henri
worked
to
build
a
stout
cage
of
saplings
and
when
it
was
finished
the
two
prisoners
were
placed
in
it
before
the
dog
was
put
in
with
gray
wolf
weyman
closely
examined
the
worn
and
collar
about
his
neck
on
the
brass
plate
he
found
engraved
the
one
word
kazan
and
with
a
strange
thrill
made
note
of
it
in
his
diary
after
this
weyman
often
remained
at
the
cabin
when
henri
went
out
on
the
after
the
second
day
he
dared
to
put
his
hand
between
the
sapling
bars
and
touch
kazan
and
the
next
day
kazan
accepted
a
piece
of
raw
moose
meat
from
his
hand
but
at
his
approach
gray
wolf
would
always
hide
under
the
pile
of
balsam
in
the
corner
of
their
prison
the
instinct
of
generations
and
perhaps
of
centuries
had
taught
her
that
man
was
her
deadliest
enemy
and
yet
this
man
did
not
hurt
her
and
kazan
was
not
afraid
of
him
she
was
frightened
at
first
then
puzzled
and
a
growing
curiosity
followed
that
occasionally
after
the
third
day
she
would
thrust
her
blind
face
out
of
the
balsam
and
sniff
the
air
when
weyman
was
at
the
cage
making
friends
with
kazan
but
she
would
not
eat
weyman
noted
that
and
each
day
he
tempted
her
with
the
choicest
morsels
of
deer
and
moose
fat
five
days
six
seven
passed
and
she
had
not
taken
a
mouthful
weyman
could
count
her
ribs
she
die
henri
told
him
on
the
seventh
night
she
starve
before
she
eat
in
that
cage
she
want
the
forest
the
wild
kill
the
fresh
blood
she
two
year
old
too
old
to
make
civilize
henri
went
to
bed
at
the
usual
hour
but
weyman
was
troubled
and
sat
up
late
he
wrote
a
long
letter
to
the
girl
at
north
battleford
and
then
he
turned
out
the
light
and
painted
visions
of
her
in
the
red
glow
of
the
fire
he
saw
her
again
for
that
first
time
when
he
camped
in
the
little
shack
where
the
fifth
city
of
saskatchewan
now
stood
with
her
blue
eyes
the
big
shining
braid
and
the
fresh
glow
of
the
prairies
in
her
cheeks
she
had
hated
him
yes
actually
hated
him
because
he
loved
to
kill
he
laughed
softly
as
he
thought
of
that
she
had
changed
him
wonderfully
he
rose
opened
the
door
softly
and
went
out
instinctively
his
eyes
turned
westward
the
sky
was
a
blaze
of
stars
in
their
light
he
could
see
the
cage
and
he
stood
watching
and
listening
a
sound
came
to
him
it
was
gray
wolf
gnawing
at
the
sapling
bars
of
her
prison
a
moment
later
there
came
a
low
sobbing
whine
and
he
knew
that
it
was
kazan
crying
for
his
freedom
leaning
against
the
side
of
the
cabin
was
an
ax
weyman
seized
it
and
his
lips
smiled
silently
he
was
thrilled
by
a
strange
happiness
and
a
thousand
miles
away
in
that
city
on
the
saskatchewan
he
could
feel
another
spirit
rejoicing
with
him
he
moved
toward
the
cage
a
dozen
blows
and
two
of
the
sapling
bars
were
knocked
out
then
weyman
drew
back
gray
wolf
found
the
opening
first
and
she
slipped
out
into
the
starlight
like
a
shadow
but
she
did
not
flee
out
in
the
open
space
she
waited
for
kazan
and
for
a
moment
the
two
stood
there
looking
at
the
cabin
then
they
set
off
into
freedom
gray
wolf
shoulder
at
flank
weyman
breathed
deeply
two
by
two
always
two
by
two
until
death
finds
one
of
them
he
whispered
chapter
xii
the
red
death
kazan
and
gray
wolf
wandered
northward
into
the
fond
du
lac
country
and
were
there
when
jacques
a
hudson
bay
company
runner
came
up
to
the
post
from
the
south
with
the
first
authentic
news
of
the
dread
plague
the
smallpox
for
weeks
there
had
been
rumors
on
all
sides
and
rumor
grew
into
rumor
from
the
east
the
south
and
the
west
they
multiplied
until
on
all
sides
the
paul
reveres
of
the
wilderness
were
carrying
word
that
mort
the
red
death
was
at
their
heels
and
the
chill
of
a
great
fear
swept
like
a
shivering
wind
from
the
edge
of
civilization
to
the
bay
nineteen
years
before
these
same
rumors
had
come
up
from
the
south
and
the
red
terror
had
followed
the
horror
of
it
still
remained
with
the
forest
people
for
a
thousand
unmarked
graves
shunned
like
a
pestilence
and
scattered
from
the
lower
waters
of
james
bay
to
the
lake
country
of
the
athabasca
gave
evidence
of
the
toll
it
demanded
now
and
then
in
their
wanderings
kazan
and
gray
wolf
had
come
upon
the
little
mounds
that
covered
the
dead
instinct
something
that
was
infinitely
beyond
the
comprehension
of
man
made
them
the
presence
of
death
about
them
perhaps
smell
it
in
the
air
gray
wild
blood
and
her
blindness
gave
her
an
immense
advantage
over
kazan
when
it
came
to
detecting
those
mysteries
of
the
air
and
the
earth
which
the
eyes
were
not
made
to
see
each
day
that
had
followed
that
terrible
moonlit
night
on
the
sun
rock
when
the
lynx
had
blinded
her
had
added
to
the
infallibility
of
her
two
chief
senses
hearing
and
scent
and
it
was
she
who
discovered
the
presence
of
the
plague
first
just
as
she
had
scented
the
great
forest
fire
hours
before
kazan
had
found
it
in
the
air
kazan
had
lured
her
back
to
a
the
trail
they
found
was
old
it
had
not
been
traveled
for
many
days
in
a
trap
they
found
a
rabbit
but
it
had
been
dead
a
long
time
in
another
there
was
the
carcass
of
a
fox
torn
into
bits
by
the
owls
most
of
the
traps
were
sprung
others
were
covered
with
snow
kazan
with
his
strain
of
dog
ran
over
the
trail
from
trap
to
trap
intent
only
on
something
alive
meat
to
devour
gray
wolf
in
her
blindness
scented
it
shivered
in
the
above
her
she
found
it
in
every
they
came
to
death
it
grew
stronger
and
stronger
and
she
whined
and
nipped
kazan
flank
and
kazan
went
on
gray
wolf
followed
him
to
the
edge
of
the
clearing
in
which
loti
cabin
stood
and
then
she
sat
back
on
her
haunches
raised
her
blind
face
to
the
gray
sky
and
gave
a
long
and
wailing
cry
in
that
moment
the
bristles
began
to
stand
up
along
kazan
spine
once
long
ago
he
had
howled
before
the
tepee
of
a
master
who
was
newly
dead
and
he
settled
back
on
his
haunches
and
gave
the
with
gray
wolf
he
too
scented
it
now
death
was
in
the
cabin
and
over
the
cabin
there
stood
a
sapling
pole
and
at
the
end
of
the
pole
there
fluttered
a
strip
of
red
cotton
rag
the
warning
flag
of
the
plague
from
athabasca
to
the
bay
this
man
like
a
hundred
other
heroes
of
the
north
had
run
up
the
warning
before
he
laid
himself
down
to
die
and
that
same
night
in
the
cold
light
of
the
moon
kazan
and
gray
wolf
swung
northward
into
the
country
of
the
fond
du
lac
there
preceded
them
a
messenger
from
the
post
on
reindeer
lake
who
was
passing
up
the
warning
that
had
come
from
nelson
house
and
the
country
to
the
southeast
there
smallpox
on
the
nelson
the
messenger
informed
williams
at
fond
du

and
it
has
struck
the
crees
on
wollaston
lake
god
only
knows
what
it
is
doing
to
the
bay
indians
but
we
hear
it
is
wiping
out
the
chippewas
between
the
albany
and
the
churchill
he
left
the
same
day
with
his
winded
dogs
i
off
to
carry
word
to
the
reveillon
people
to
the
west
he
explained
three
days
later
word
came
from
churchill
that
all
of
the
servants
and
his
majesty
subjects
west
of
the
bay
should
prepare
themselves
for
the
coming
of
the
red
terror
williams
thin
face
turned
as
white
as
the
paper
he
held
as
he
read
the
words
of
the
churchill
factor
it
means
dig
graves
he
said
that
the
only
preparation
we
can
make
he
read
the
paper
aloud
to
the
men
at
fond
du
lac
and
every
available
man
was
detailed
to
spread
the
warning
throughout
the
post
territory
there
was
a
quick
harnessing
of
dogs
and
on
each
sledge
that
went
out
was
a
roll
of
red
cotton
cloth
rolls
that
were
ominous
of
death
lurid
signals
of
pestilence
and
horror
whose
touch
sent
shuddering
chills
through
the
men
who
were
about
to
scatter
them
among
the
forest
people
kazan
and
gray
wolf
struck
the
trail
of
one
of
these
sledges
on
the
gray
beaver
and
followed
it
for
half
a
mile
the
next
day
farther
to
the
west
they
struck
another
and
on
the
fourth
day
still
a
third
the
last
trail
was
fresh
and
gray
wolf
drew
back
from
it
as
if
stung
her
fangs
snarling
on
the
wind
there
came
to
them
the
pungent
odor
of
smoke
they
cut
at
right
angles
to
the
trail
gray
wolf
leaping
clear
of
the
marks
in
the
snow
and
climbed
to
the
cap
of
a
ridge
to
windward
of
them
and
down
in
the
plain
a
cabin
was
burning
a
team
of
huskies
and
a
man
were
disappearing
in
the
spruce
forest
deep
down
in
his
throat
kazan
gave
a
rumbling
whine
gray
wolf
stood
as
rigid
as
a
rock
in
the
cabin
a
man
was
burning
it
was
the
law
of
the
north
and
the
mystery
of
the
funeral
pyre
came
again
to
kazan
and
gray
wolf
this
time
they
did
not
howl
but
slunk
down
into
the
farther
plain
and
did
not
stop
that
day
until
they
had
buried
themselves
deep
in
a
dry
and
sheltered
swamp
ten
miles
to
the
north
after
this
they
followed
the
days
and
weeks
which
marked
the
winter
of
nineteen
hundred
and
ten
as
one
of
the
most
terrible
in
all
the
history
of
the
northland
a
single
month
in
which
wild
life
as
well
as
human
hung
in
the
balance
and
when
cold
starvation
and
plague
wrote
a
chapter
in
the
lives
of
the
forest
people
which
will
not
be
forgotten
for
generations
to
come
in
the
swamp
kazan
and
gray
wolf
found
a
home
under
a
windfall
it
was
a
small
comfortable
nest
shut
in
entirely
from
the
snow
and
wind
gray
wolf
took
possession
of
it
immediately
she
flattened
herself
out
on
her
belly
and
panted
to
show
kazan
her
contentment
and
satisfaction
nature
again
kept
kazan
close
at
her
side
a
vision
came
to
him
unreal
and
of
that
wonderful
night
under
the
stars
ages
and
ages
ago
it
seemed
when
he
had
fought
the
leader
of
the
and
young
gray
wolf
had
crept
to
his
side
after
his
victory
and
had
given
herself
to
him
for
mate
but
this
mating
season
there
was
no
running
after
the
doe
or
the
caribou
or
mingling
with
the
wild
pack
they
lived
chiefly
on
rabbit
and
spruce
partridge
because
of
gray
wolf
blindness
kazan
could
hunt
those
alone
the
hair
had
now
grown
over
gray
sightless
eyes
she
had
ceased
to
grieve
to
rub
her
eyes
with
her
paws
to
whine
for
the
sunlight
the
golden
moon
and
the
stars
slowly
she
began
to
forget
that
she
had
ever
seen
those
things
she
could
now
run
more
swiftly
at
kazan
flank
scent
and
hearing
had
become
wonderfully
keen
she
could
wind
a
caribou
two
miles
distant
and
the
presence
of
man
she
could
pick
up
at
an
even
greater
distance
on
a
still
night
she
had
heard
the
splash
of
a
trout
half
a
mile
away
and
as
these
two
things
scent
and
hearing
became
more
and
more
developed
in
her
those
same
senses
became
less
active
in
kazan
he
began
to
depend
upon
gray
wolf
she
would
point
out
the
of
a
partridge
fifty
yards
from
their
trail
in
their
hunts
she
became
the
leader
until
game
was
found
and
as
kazan
learned
to
trust
to
her
in
the
hunt
so
he
began
just
as
instinctively
to
heed
her
warnings
if
gray
wolf
reasoned
it
was
to
the
effect
that
without
kazan
she
would
die
she
had
tried
hard
now
and
then
to
catch
a
partridge
or
a
rabbit
but
she
had
always
failed
kazan
meant
life
to
her
and
if
she
reasoned
it
was
to
make
herself
indispensable
to
her
mate
blindness
had
made
her
different
than
she
would
otherwise
have
been
again
nature
promised
motherhood
to
her
but
she
did
not
as
she
would
have
done
in
the
open
and
with
sight
hold
more
and
more
aloof
from
kazan
as
the
days
passed
it
was
her
habit
spring
summer
and
winter
to
snuggle
close
to
kazan
and
lie
with
her
beautiful
head
resting
on
his
neck
or
back
if
kazan
snarled
at
her
she
did
not
snap
back
but
slunk
down
as
though
struck
a
blow
with
her
warm
tongue
she
would
lick
away
the
ice
that
froze
to
the
long
hair
between
kazan
toes
for
days
after
he
had
run
a
sliver
in
his
paw
she
nursed
his
foot
blindness
had
made
kazan
absolutely
necessary
to
her
existence
and
now
in
a
different
way
she
became
more
and
more
necessary
to
kazan
they
were
happy
in
their
swamp
home
there
was
plenty
of
small
game
about
them
and
it
was
warm
under
the
windfall
rarely
did
they
go
beyond
the
limits
of
the
swamp
to
hunt
out
on
the
more
distant
plains
and
the
barren
ridges
they
occasionally
heard
the
cry
of
the
on
the
trail
of
meat
but
it
no
longer
thrilled
them
with
a
desire
to
join
in
the
chase
one
day
they
struck
farther
than
usual
to
the
west
they
left
the
swamp
crossed
a
plain
over
which
a
fire
had
swept
the
preceding
year
climbed
a
ridge
and
descended
into
a
second
plain
at
the
bottom
gray
wolf
stopped
and
sniffed
the
air
at
these
times
kazan
always
watched
her
waiting
eagerly
and
nervously
if
the
scent
was
too
faint
for
him
to
catch
but
he
caught
the
edge
of
it
and
he
knew
why
gray
ears
flattened
and
her
hindquarters
drooped
the
scent
of
game
would
have
made
her
rigid
and
alert
but
it
was
not
the
game
smell
it
was
human
and
gray
wolf
slunk
behind
kazan
and
whined
for
several
minutes
they
stood
without
moving
or
making
a
sound
and
then
kazan
led
the
way
on
less
than
three
hundred
yards
away
they
came
to
a
thick
clump
of
scrub
spruce
and
almost
ran
into
a
tepee
it
was
abandoned
life
and
fire
had
not
been
there
for
a
long
time
but
from
the
tepee
had
come
the
with
legs
rigid
and
his
spine
quivering
kazan
approached
the
opening
to
the
tepee
he
looked
in
in
the
middle
of
the
tepee
lying
on
the
charred
embers
of
a
fire
lay
a
ragged
blanket
and
in
the
blanket
was
wrapped
the
body
of
a
little
indian
child
kazan
could
see
the
tiny
moccasined
feet
but
so
long
had
death
been
there
that
he
could
scarcely
smell
the
presence
of
it
he
drew
back
and
saw
gray
wolf
cautiously
nosing
about
a
long
and
peculiarly
shaped
hummock
in
the
snow
she
had
traveled
about
it
three
times
but
never
approaching
nearer
than
a
man
could
have
reached
with
a
rifle
barrel
at
the
end
of
her
third
circle
she
sat
down
on
her
haunches
and
kazan
went
close
to
the
hummock
and
sniffed
under
that
bulge
in
the
snow
as
well
as
in
the
tepee
there
was
death
they
slunk
away
their
ears
flattened
and
their
tails
drooping
until
they
trailed
the
snow
and
did
not
stop
until
they
reached
their
swamp
home
even
there
gray
wolf
still
sniffed
the
horror
of
the
plague
and
her
muscles
twitched
and
shivered
as
she
lay
close
at
kazan
side
that
night
the
big
white
moon
had
around
its
edge
a
crimson
rim
it
meant
cold
intense
cold
always
the
plague
came
in
the
days
of
greatest
cold
the
lower
the
temperature
the
more
terrible
its
havoc
it
grew
steadily
colder
that
night
and
the
increased
chill
penetrated
to
the
heart
of
the
windfall
and
drew
kazan
and
gray
wolf
closer
together
with
dawn
which
came
at
about
eight
kazan
and
his
blind
mate
sallied
forth
into
the
day
it
was
fifty
degrees
below
zero
about
them
the
trees
cracked
with
reports
like
in
the
thickest
spruce
the
partridges
were
humped
into
round
balls
of
feathers
the
rabbits
had
burrowed
deep
under
the
snow
or
to
the
heart
of
the
heaviest
windfalls
kazan
and
gray
wolf
found
few
fresh
trails
and
after
an
hour
of
fruitless
hunting
they
returned
to
their
lair
kazan
had
buried
the
half
of
a
rabbit
two
or
three
days
before
and
they
dug
this
out
of
the
snow
and
ate
the
frozen
flesh
all
that
day
it
grew
colder
steadily
colder
the
night
that
followed
was
cloudless
with
a
white
moon
and
brilliant
stars
the
temperature
had
fallen
another
ten
degrees
and
nothing
was
moving
traps
were
never
sprung
on
such
nights
for
even
the
furred
things
the
mink
and
the
ermine
and
the
lynx
lay
snug
in
the
holes
and
the
nests
they
had
found
for
themselves
an
increasing
hunger
was
not
strong
enough
to
drive
kazan
and
gray
wolf
from
their
windfall
the
next
day
there
was
no
break
in
the
terrible
cold
and
toward
noon
kazan
set
out
on
a
hunt
for
meat
leaving
gray
wolf
in
the
windfall
being
dog
food
was
more
necessary
to
kazan
than
to
his
mate
nature
has
fitted
the
for
famine
and
in
ordinary
temperature
gray
wolf
could
have
lived
for
a
fortnight
without
food
at
sixty
degrees
below
zero
she
could
exist
a
week
perhaps
ten
days
only
thirty
hours
had
passed
sinee
they
had
devoured
the
last
of
the
frozen
rabbit
and
she
was
quite
satisfied
to
remain
in
their
snug
retreat
but
kazan
was
hungry
he
began
to
hunt
in
the
face
of
the
wind
traveling
toward
the
burned
plain
he
nosed
about
every
windfall
that
he
came
to
and
investigated
the
thickets
a
thin
snow
had
fallen
and
in
this
from
the
windfall
to
the
burn
he
found
but
a
single
trail
and
that
was
the
trail
of
an
ermine
under
a
windfall
he
caught
the
warm
scent
of
a
rabbit
but
the
rabbit
was
as
safe
from
him
there
as
were
the
partridges
in
the
trees
and
after
an
hour
of
futile
digging
and
gnawing
he
gave
up
his
effort
to
reach
it
for
three
hours
he
had
hunted
when
he
returned
to
gray
wolf
he
was
exhausted
while
gray
wolf
with
the
instinct
of
the
wild
had
saved
her
own
strength
and
energy
kazan
had
been
burning
up
his
reserve
forces
and
was
hungrier
than
ever
the
moon
rose
clear
and
brilliant
in
the
sky
again
that
night
and
kazan
set
out
once
more
on
the
hunt
he
urged
gray
wolf
to
accompany
him
whining
for
her
outside
the
windfall
returning
for
her
twice
but
gray
wolf
laid
her
ears
aslant
and
refused
to
move
the
temperature
had
now
fallen
to
or
seventy
degrees
below
zero
and
with
it
there
came
from
the
north
an
increasing
wind
making
the
night
one
in
which
human
life
could
not
have
existed
for
an
hour
by
midnight
kazan
was
back
under
the
windfall
the
wind
grew
stronger
it
began
to
wail
in
mournful
dirges
over
the
swamp
and
then
it
burst
in
fierce
shrieking
volleys
with
intervals
of
quiet
between
these
were
the
first
warnings
from
the
great
barrens
that
lay
between
the
last
lines
of
timber
and
the
arctic
with
morning
the
storm
burst
in
all
its
fury
from
out
of
the
north
and
gray
wolf
and
kazan
lay
close
together
and
shivered
as
they
listened
to
the
roar
of
it
over
the
windfall
once
kazan
thrust
his
head
and
shoulders
out
from
the
shelter
of
the
fallen
trees
but
the
storm
drove
him
back
everything
that
possessed
life
had
sought
shelter
according
to
its
way
and
instinct
the
furred
creatures
like
the
mink
and
the
ermine
were
safest
for
during
the
warmer
hunting
days
they
were
of
the
kind
that
cached
meat
the
wolves
and
the
foxes
had
sought
out
the
windfalls
and
the
rocks
winged
things
with
the
exception
of
the
owls
who
were
a
tenth
part
body
and
feathers
burrowed
under
or
found
shelter
in
thick
spruce
to
the
hoofed
and
horned
animals
the
storm
meant
greatest
havoc
the
deer
the
caribou
and
the
moose
could
not
crawl
under
windfalls
or
creep
between
rocks
the
best
they
could
do
was
to
lie
down
in
the
lee
of
a
drift
and
allow
themselves
to
be
covered
deep
with
the
protecting
snow
even
then
they
could
not
keep
their
shelter
long
for
they
had
to
for
eighteen
hours
out
of
the
the
moose
had
to
feed
to
keep
himself
alive
during
the
winter
his
big
stomach
demanded
quantity
and
it
took
him
most
of
his
time
to
nibble
from
the
tops
of
bushes
the
two
or
three
bushels
he
needed
a
day
the
caribou
required
almost
as
much
the
deer
least
of
the
three
and
the
storm
kept
up
that
day
and
the
next
and
still
a
third
three
days
and
three
nights
and
the
third
day
and
night
there
came
with
it
a
stinging
snow
that
fell
two
feet
deep
on
the
level
and
in
drifts
of
eight
and
ten
it
was
the
heavy
snow
of
the
indians
the
snow
that
lay
like
lead
on
the
earth
and
under
which
partridges
and
rabbits
were
smothered
in
thousands
on
the
fourth
day
after
the
beginning
of
the
storm
kazan
and
gray
wolf
issued
forth
from
the
windfall
there
was
no
longer
a
wind
no
more
falling
snow
the
whole
world
lay
under
a
blanket
of
unbroken
white
and
it
was
intensely
cold
the
plague
had
worked
its
havoc
with
men
now
had
come
the
days
of
famine
and
death
for
the
wild
things
chapter
xiii
the
trail
of
hunger
kazan
and
gray
wolf
had
been
a
hundred
and
forty
hours
without
food
to
gray
wolf
this
meant
acute
discomfort
a
growing
weakness
to
kazan
it
was
starvation
six
days
and
six
nights
of
fasting
had
drawn
in
their
ribs
and
put
deep
hollows
in
front
of
their
hindquarters
kazan
eyes
were
red
and
they
narrowed
to
slits
as
he
looked
forth
into
the
day
gray
wolf
followed
him
this
time
when
he
went
out
on
the
hard
snow
eagerly
and
hopefully
they
began
the
hunt
in
the
bitter
cold
they
swung
around
the
edge
of
the
windfall
where
there
had
always
been
rabbits
there
were
no
tracks
now
and
no
scent
they
continued
in
a
horseshoe
circle
through
the
swamp
and
the
only
scent
they
caught
was
that
of
a
perched
up
in
a
spruce
they
came
to
the
burn
and
turned
back
hunting
the
opposite
side
of
the
swamp
on
this
side
there
was
a
ridge
they
climbed
the
ridge
and
from
the
cap
of
it
looked
out
over
a
world
that
was
barren
of
life
ceaselessly
gray
wolf
sniffed
the
air
but
she
gave
no
signal
to
kazan
on
the
top
of
the
ridge
kazan
stood
panting
his
endurance
was
gone
on
their
return
through
the
swamp
he
stumbled
over
an
obstacle
which
he
tried
to
clear
with
a
jump
hungrier
and
weaker
they
returned
to
the
windfall
the
night
that
followed
was
clear
and
brilliant
with
stars
they
hunted
the
swamp
again
nothing
was
moving
save
one
other
creature
and
that
was
a
fox
instinct
told
them
that
it
was
futile
to
follow
him
it
was
then
that
the
old
thought
of
the
cabin
returned
to
kazan
two
things
the
cabin
had
always
meant
to
him
warmth
and
food
and
far
beyond
the
ridge
was
the
cabin
where
he
and
gray
wolf
had
howled
at
the
scent
of
death
he
did
not
think
of
man
or
of
that
mystery
which
he
had
howled
at
he
thought
only
of
the
cabin
and
the
cabin
had
always
meant
food
he
set
off
in
a
straight
line
for
the
ridge
and
gray
wolf
followed
they
crossed
the
ridge
and
the
burn
beyond
and
entered
the
edge
of
a
second
swamp
kazan
was
hunting
listlessly
now
his
head
hung
low
his
bushy
tail
dragged
in
the
snow
he
was
intent
on
the
cabin
only
the
cabin
it
was
his
last
hope
but
gray
wolf
was
still
alert
taking
in
the
wind
and
lifting
her
head
whenever
kazan
stopped
to
snuffle
his
chilled
nose
in
the
snow
at
last
it
came
the
scent
kazan
had
moved
on
but
he
stopped
when
he
found
that
gray
wolf
was
not
following
all
the
strength
that
was
in
his
starved
body
revealed
itself
in
a
sudden
rigid
tenseness
as
he
looked
at
his
mate
her
forefeet
were
planted
firmly
to
the
east
her
slim
gray
head
was
reaching
out
for
the
scent
her
body
trembled
then
suddenly
they
heard
a
sound
and
with
a
whining
cry
kazan
set
out
in
its
direction
with
gray
wolf
at
his
flank
the
scent
grew
stronger
and
stronger
in
gray
wolf
nostrils
and
soon
it
came
to
kazan
it
was
not
the
scent
of
a
rabbit
or
a
partridge
it
was
big
game
they
approached
cautiously
keeping
full
in
the
wind
the
swamp
grew
thicker
the
spruce
more
dense
and
now
from
a
hundred
yards
ahead
of
them
there
came
a
crashing
of
locked
and
battling
horns
ten
seconds
more
they
climbed
over
a
snowdrift
and
kazan
stopped
and
dropped
flat
on
his
belly
gray
wolf
crouched
close
at
his
side
her
blind
eyes
turned
to
what
she
could
smell
but
could
not
see
fifty
yards
from
them
a
number
of
moose
had
gathered
for
shelter
in
the
thick
spruce
they
had
eaten
clear
a
space
an
acre
in
extent
the
trees
were
cropped
bare
as
high
as
they
could
reach
and
the
snow
was
beaten
hard
under
their
feet
there
were
six
animals
in
the
acre
two
of
them
bulls
and
these
bulls
were
fighting
while
three
cows
and
a
yearling
were
huddled
in
a
group
watching
the
mighty
duel
just
before
the
storm
a
young
bull
sleek
grown
and
with
the
small
compact
antlers
of
a
had
led
the
three
cows
and
the
yearling
to
this
sheltered
spot
among
the
spruce
until
last
night
he
had
been
master
of
the
herd
during
the
night
the
older
bull
had
invaded
his
dominion
the
invader
was
four
times
as
old
as
the
young
bull
he
was
half
again
as
heavy
his
huge
palmate
horns
knotted
and
irregular
but
massive
spoke
of
age
a
warrior
of
a
hundred
fights
he
had
not
hesitated
to
give
battle
in
his
effort
to
rob
the
younger
bull
of
his
home
and
family
three
times
they
had
fought
since
dawn
and
the
snow
was
red
with
blood
the
smell
of
it
came
to
and
gray
wolf
nostrils
kazan
sniffed
hungrily
queer
sounds
rolled
up
and
down
in
gray
wolf
throat
and
she
licked
her
jaws
for
a
moment
the
two
fighters
drew
a
few
yards
apart
and
stood
with
lowered
heads
the
old
bull
had
not
yet
won
victory
the
younger
bull
represented
youth
and
endurance
in
the
older
bull
those
things
were
pitted
against
craft
greater
weight
maturer
strength
and
a
head
and
horns
that
were
like
a
battering
ram
but
in
that
great
hulk
of
the
older
bull
there
was
one
other
thing
age
his
huge
sides
were
panting
his
nostrils
were
as
wide
as
bells
then
as
if
some
invisible
spirit
of
the
arena
had
given
the
signal
the
animals
came
together
again
the
crash
of
their
horns
could
have
been
heard
half
a
mile
away
and
under
twelve
hundred
pounds
of
flesh
and
bone
the
younger
hull
went
plunging
back
upon
his
haunches
then
was
when
youth
displayed
itself
in
an
instant
he
was
up
and
locking
horns
with
his
adversary
twenty
times
he
had
done
this
and
each
attack
had
seemed
filled
with
increasing
strength
and
now
as
if
realizing
that
the
last
moments
of
the
last
fight
had
come
he
twisted
the
old
bull
neck
and
fought
as
he
had
never
fought
before
kazan
and
gray
wolf
both
heard
the
sharp
crack
that
followed
as
if
a
dry
stick
had
been
stepped
upon
and
broken
it
was
february
and
the
hoofed
animals
were
already
beginning
to
shed
their
horns
especially
the
older
bulls
whose
palmate
growths
drop
first
this
fact
gave
victory
to
the
younger
bull
in
the
arena
a
few
yards
from
gray
wolf
and
kazan
from
its
socket
in
the
old
skull
one
of
his
huge
antlers
broke
with
that
sharp
snapping
sound
and
in
another
moment
four
inches
of
horn
buried
itself
back
of
his
foreleg
in
an
instant
all
hope
and
courage
left
him
and
he
swung
backward
yard
by
yard
with
the
younger
bull
prodding
his
neck
and
shoulders
until
blood
dripped
from
him
in
little
streams
at
the
edge
of
the
clearing
he
flung
himself
free
and
crashed
off
into
the
forest
the
younger
bull
did
not
pursue
he
tossed
his
head
and
stood
for
a
few
moments
with
heaving
sides
and
dilated
nostrils
facing
in
the
direction
his
vanquished
foe
had
taken
then
he
turned
and
trotted
back
to
the
still
motionless
cows
and
yearling
kazan
and
gray
wolf
were
quivering
gray
wolf
slunk
back
from
the
edge
of
the
clearing
and
kazan
followed
no
longer
were
they
interested
in
the
cows
and
the
young
bull
from
that
clearing
they
had
seen
meat
driven
forth
meat
that
was
beaten
in
fight
and
bleeding
every
instinct
of
the
wild
pack
returned
to
gray
wolf
now
and
in
kazan
the
mad
desire
to
taste
the
blood
he
smelled
swiftly
they
turned
toward
the
trail
of
the
old
bull
and
when
they
came
to
it
they
found
it
spattered
red
kazan
jaws
dripped
as
the
hot
scent
drove
the
blood
like
veins
of
fire
through
his
weakened
body
his
eyes
were
reddened
by
starvation
and
in
them
there
was
a
light
now
that
they
had
never
known
even
in
the
days
of
the
he
set
off
swiftly
almost
forgetful
of
gray
wolf
but
his
mate
no
longer
required
his
flank
for
guidance
with
her
nose
close
to
the
trail
she
ran
ran
as
she
had
run
in
the
long
and
thrilling
hunts
before
blindness
came
half
a
mile
from
the
spruce
thicket
they
came
upon
the
old
bull
he
had
sought
shelter
behind
a
clump
of
balsam
and
he
stood
over
a
growing
pool
of
blood
in
the
snow
he
was
still
breathing
hard
his
massive
head
grotesque
now
with
its
one
antler
was
drooping
flecks
of
blood
dropped
from
his
distended
nostrils
even
then
with
the
old
bull
weakened
by
starvation
exhaustion
and
loss
of
blood
a
would
have
hung
back
before
attacking
where
they
would
have
hesitated
kazan
leaped
in
with
a
snarling
cry
for
an
instant
his
fangs
sunk
into
the
thick
hide
of
the
bull
throat
then
he
was
flung
back
twenty
feet
hunger
gnawing
at
his
vitals
robbed
him
of
all
caution
and
he
sprang
to
the
attack
again
full
at
the
front
while
gray
wolf
crept
up
unseen
behind
seeking
in
her
blindness
the
vulnerable
part
which
nature
had
not
taught
kazan
to
find
this
time
kazan
was
caught
fairly
on
the
broad
palmate
leaf
of
the
bull
antler
and
he
was
flung
back
again
half
stunned
in
that
same
moment
gray
wolf
long
white
teeth
cut
like
knives
through
one
of
the
bull
hamstrings
for
thirty
seconds
she
kept
the
hold
while
the
bull
plunged
wildly
in
his
efforts
to
trample
her
underfoot
kazan
was
quick
to
learn
still
quicker
to
be
guided
by
gray
wolf
and
he
leaped
in
again
snapping
for
a
hold
on
the
bulging
cord
just
above
the
knee
he
missed
and
as
he
lunged
forward
on
his
shoulders
gray
wolf
was
flung
off
but
she
had
accomplished
her
purpose
beaten
in
open
battle
with
one
of
his
kind
and
now
attacked
by
a
still
deadlier
foe
the
old
bull
began
to
retreat
as
he
went
one
hip
sank
under
him
at
every
step
the
tendon
of
his
left
leg
was
bitten
half
through
without
being
able
to
see
gray
wolf
seemed
to
realize
what
had
happened
again
she
was
the
with
all
the
old
wolf
strategy
twice
flung
back
by
the
old
bull
horn
kazan
knew
better
than
to
attack
openly
again
gray
wolf
trotted
after
the
bull
but
he
remained
behind
for
a
moment
to
lick
up
hungrily
mouthfuls
of
the
snow
then
he
followed
and
ran
close
against
gray
wolf
side
fifty
yards
behind
the
bull
there
was
more
blood
in
the
trail
now
a
thin
red
ribbon
of
it
fifteen
minutes
later
the
bull
stopped
again
and
faced
about
his
great
head
lowered
his
eyes
were
red
there
was
a
droop
to
his
neck
and
shoulders
that
spoke
no
longer
of
the
unconquerable
fighting
spirit
that
had
been
a
part
of
him
for
nearly
a
score
of
years
no
longer
was
he
lord
of
the
wilderness
about
him
no
longer
was
there
defiance
in
the
poise
of
his
splendid
head
or
the
flash
of
eager
fire
in
his
bloodshot
eyes
his
breath
came
with
a
gasping
sound
that
was
growing
more
and
more
distinct
a
hunter
would
have
known
what
it
meant
the
of
the
younger
bull
antler
had
gone
home
and
the
old
bull
lungs
were
failing
him
more
than
once
gray
wolf
had
heard
that
sound
in
the
early
days
of
her
hunting
with
the
pack
and
she
understood
slowly
she
began
to
circle
about
the
wounded
monarch
at
a
distance
of
about
twenty
yards
kazan
kept
at
her
side
once
twice
twenty
times
they
made
that
slow
circle
and
with
each
turn
they
made
the
old
bull
turned
and
his
breath
grew
heavier
and
his
head
drooped
lower
noon
came
and
was
followed
by
the
more
intense
cold
of
the
last
half
of
the
day
twenty
circles
became
a
hundred
two
hundred
and
more
under
gray
wolf
and
kazan
feet
the
snow
grew
hard
in
the
path
they
made
under
the
old
bull
widespread
hoofs
the
snow
was
no
longer
white
but
red
a
thousand
times
before
this
unseen
tragedy
of
the
wilderness
had
been
enacted
it
was
an
epoch
of
that
life
where
life
itself
means
the
survival
of
the
fittest
where
to
live
means
to
kill
and
to
die
means
to
perpetuate
life
at
last
in
that
steady
and
deadly
circling
of
gray
wolf
and
kazan
there
came
a
time
when
the
old
bull
did
not
turn
then
a
second
a
third
and
a
fourth
time
and
gray
wolf
seemed
to
know
with
kazan
she
drew
back
from
the
trail
and
they
flattened
themselves
on
their
bellies
under
a
dwarf
spruce
and
waited
for
many
minutes
the
bull
stood
motionless
his
hamstrung
quarter
sinking
lower
and
lower
and
then
with
a
deep
gasp
he
sank
down
for
a
long
time
kazan
and
gray
wolf
did
not
move
and
when
at
last
they
returned
to
the
beaten
trail
the
bull
heavy
head
was
resting
on
the
snow
again
they
began
to
circle
and
now
the
circle
narrowed
foot
by
foot
until
only
ten
yards
then
nine
then
eight
separated
them
from
their
prey
the
bull
attempted
to
rise
and
failed
gray
wolf
heard
the
effort
she
heard
him
sink
back
and
suddenly
she
leaped
in
swiftly
and
silently
from
behind
her
sharp
fangs
buried
themselves
in
the
nostrils
and
with
the
first
instinct
of
the
husky
kazan
sprang
for
a
throat
hold
this
time
he
was
not
flung
off
it
was
gray
wolf
terrible
hold
that
gave
him
time
to
tear
through
the
hide
and
to
bury
his
teeth
deeper
and
deeper
until
at
last
they
reached
the
jugular
a
gush
of
warm
blood
spurted
into
his
face
but
he
did
not
let
go
just
as
he
had
held
to
the
jugular
of
his
first
buck
on
that
moonlight
night
a
long
time
ago
so
he
held
to
the
old
bull
now
it
was
gray
wolf
who
unclamped
his
jaws
she
drew
back
sniffing
the
air
listening
then
slowly
she
raised
her
head
and
through
the
frozen
and
starving
wilderness
there
went
her
wailing
triumphant
cry
the
call
to
meat
for
them
the
days
of
famine
had
passed
chapter
xiv
the
right
of
fang
after
the
fight
kazan
lay
down
exhausted
in
the
snow
while
faithful
gray
wolf
still
filled
with
the
endurance
of
her
wild
wolf
breed
tore
fiercely
at
the
thick
skin
on
the
bull
neck
to
lay
open
the
red
flesh
when
she
had
done
this
she
did
not
eat
but
ran
to
kazan
side
and
whined
softly
as
she
muzzled
him
with
her
nose
after
that
they
feasted
crouching
side
by
side
at
the
bull
neck
and
tearing
at
the
warm
sweet
flesh
the
last
pale
light
of
the
northern
day
was
fading
swiftly
into
night
when
they
drew
back
gorged
until
there
were
no
longer
hollows
in
their
sides
the
faint
wind
died
away
the
clouds
that
had
hung
in
the
sky
during
the
day
drifted
eastward
and
the
moon
shone
brilliant
and
clear
for
an
hour
the
night
continued
to
grow
lighter
to
the
brilliance
of
the
moon
and
the
stars
there
was
added
now
the
pale
fires
of
the
aurora
borealis
shivering
and
flashing
over
the
pole
its
hissing
crackling
monotone
like
the
creaking
of
steel
on
snow
came
faintly
to
the
ears
of
kazan
and
gray
wolf
as
yet
they
had
not
gone
a
hundred
yards
from
the
dead
bull
and
at
the
first
sound
of
that
strange
mystery
in
the
northern
skies
they
stopped
and
listened
to
it
alert
and
suspicious
then
they
laid
their
ears
aslant
and
trotted
slowly
back
to
the
meat
they
had
killed
instinct
told
them
that
it
was
theirs
only
by
right
of
fang
they
had
fought
to
kill
it
and
it
was
in
the
law
of
the
wild
that
they
would
have
to
fight
to
keep
it
in
good
hunting
days
they
would
have
gone
on
and
wandered
under
the
moon
and
the
stars
but
long
days
and
nights
of
starvation
had
taught
them
something
different
now
on
that
clear
and
stormless
night
following
the
days
of
plague
and
famine
a
hundred
thousand
hungry
creatures
came
out
from
their
retreats
to
hunt
for
food
for
eighteen
hundred
miles
east
and
west
and
a
thousand
miles
north
and
south
slim
creatures
hunted
under
the
moon
and
the
stars
something
told
kazan
and
gray
wolf
that
this
hunt
was
on
and
never
for
an
instant
did
they
cease
their
vigilance
at
last
they
lay
down
at
the
edge
of
the
spruce
thicket
and
waited
gray
wolf
muzzled
kazan
gently
with
her
blind
face
the
uneasy
whine
in
her
throat
was
a
warning
to
him
then
she
sniffed
the
air
and
listened
sniffed
and
listened
suddenly
every
muscle
in
their
bodies
grew
rigid
something
living
had
passed
near
them
something
that
they
could
not
see
or
hear
and
scarcely
scent
it
came
again
as
mysterious
as
a
shadow
and
then
out
of
the
air
there
floated
down
as
silently
as
a
huge
snowflake
a
great
white
owl
kazan
saw
the
hungry
winged
creature
settle
on
the
shoulder
like
a
flash
he
was
out
from
his
cover
gray
wolf
a
yard
behind
him
with
an
angry
snarl
he
lunged
at
the
white
robber
and
his
jaws
snapped
on
empty
air
his
leap
carried
him
clean
over
the
bull
he
turned
but
the
owl
was
gone
nearly
all
of
his
old
strength
had
returned
to
him
now
he
trotted
about
the
bull
the
hair
along
his
spine
bristling
like
a
brush
his
eyes
wide
and
menacing
he
snarled
at
the
still
air
his
jaws
clicked
and
he
sat
back
on
his
haunches
and
faced
the
trail
that
the
moose
had
left
before
he
died
again
that
instinct
as
infallible
as
reason
told
him
that
danger
would
come
from
there
like
a
red
ribbon
the
trail
ran
back
through
the
wilderness
the
little
ermine
were
everywhere
this
night
looking
like
white
rats
as
they
dodged
about
in
the
moonlight
they
were
first
to
find
the
trail
and
with
all
the
ferocity
of
their
nature
followed
it
with
quick
exciting
leaps
a
fox
caught
the
scent
of
it
a
quarter
of
a
mile
to
windward
and
came
nearer
from
out
of
a
deep
windfall
a
came
forth
and
stopped
with
his
feet
in
the
crimson
ribbon
it
was
the
that
brought
kazan
out
from
under
his
cover
of
spruce
again
in
the
moonlight
there
was
a
sharp
quick
fight
a
snarling
and
scratching
a
yowl
of
pain
and
the
fisher
forgot
his
hunger
in
flight
kazan
returned
to
gray
wolf
with
a
lacerated
and
bleeding
nose
gray
wolf
licked
it
sympathetically
while
kazan
stood
rigid
and
listening
the
fox
swung
swiftly
away
with
the
wind
warned
by
the
sounds
of
conflict
he
was
not
a
fighter
but
a
murderer
who
killed
from
behind
and
a
little
later
he
leaped
upon
an
owl
and
tore
it
into
bits
for
the
of
flesh
within
the
mass
of
feathers
but
nothing
could
drive
back
those
little
white
outlaws
of
the
wilderness
the
ermine
they
would
have
stolen
between
the
feet
of
man
to
get
at
the
warm
flesh
and
blood
of
the
freshly
killed
bull
kazan
hunted
them
savagely
they
were
too
quick
for
him
more
like
elusive
flashes
in
the
moonlight
than
things
of
life
they
burrowed
under
the
old
bull
body
and
fed
while
he
raved
and
filled
his
mouth
with
snow
gray
wolf
sat
placidly
on
her
haunches
the
little
ermine
did
not
trouble
her
and
after
a
time
kazan
realized
this
and
flung
himself
down
beside
her
panting
and
exhausted
for
a
long
time
after
that
the
night
was
almost
unbroken
by
sound
once
in
the
far
distance
there
came
the
cry
of
a
wolf
and
now
and
then
to
punctuate
the
deathly
silence
the
snow
owl
hooted
in
protest
from
his
home
in
the
the
moon
was
straight
above
the
old
bull
when
gray
wolf
scented
the
first
real
danger
instantly
she
gave
the
warning
to
kazan
and
faced
the
bloody
trail
her
lithe
body
quivering
her
fangs
gleaming
in
the
starlight
a
snarling
whine
in
her
throat
only
in
the
face
of
their
deadliest
enemy
the
lynx
the
terrible
fighter
who
had
blinded
her
long
ago
in
that
battle
on
the
sun
rock
did
she
give
such
warning
as
this
to
kazan
he
sprang
ahead
of
her
ready
for
battle
even
before
he
caught
the
scent
of
the
gray
beautiful
creature
of
death
stealing
over
the
trail
then
came
the
interruption
from
a
mile
away
there
burst
forth
a
single
fierce
howl
after
all
that
was
the
cry
of
the
true
master
of
the
wilderness
the
wolf
it
was
the
cry
of
hunger
it
was
the
cry
that
sent
men
blood
running
more
swiftly
through
their
veins
that
brought
the
moose
and
the
deer
to
their
feet
shivering
in
every
limb
the
cry
that
wailed
like
a
note
of
death
through
swamp
and
forest
and
over
the
ridges
until
its
faintest
echoes
reached
for
miles
into
the
starlit
night
there
was
silence
and
in
that
awesome
stillness
kazan
and
gray
wolf
stood
shoulder
to
shoulder
facing
the
cry
and
in
response
to
that
cry
there
worked
within
them
a
strange
and
mystic
change
for
what
they
had
heard
was
not
a
warning
or
a
menace
but
the
call
of
brotherhood
away
off
there
beyond
the
lynx
and
the
fox
and
the
were
the
creatures
of
their
kind
the
pack
to
which
the
right
to
all
flesh
and
blood
was
common
in
which
existed
that
savage
socialism
of
the
wilderness
the
brotherhood
of
the
wolf
and
gray
wolf
setting
back
on
her
haunches
sent
forth
the
response
to
that
cry
a
wailing
triumphant
note
that
told
her
hungry
brethren
there
was
feasting
at
the
end
of
the
trail
and
the
lynx
between
those
two
cries
sneaked
off
into
the
wide
and
moonlit
spaces
of
the
forest
chapter
xv
a
fight
under
the
stars
on
their
haunches
kazan
and
gray
wolf
waited
five
minutes
passed
ten
fifteen
and
gray
wolf
became
uneasy
no
response
had
followed
her
call
again
she
howled
with
kazan
quivering
and
listening
beside
her
and
again
there
followed
that
dead
stillness
of
the
night
this
was
not
the
way
of
the
pack
she
knew
that
it
had
not
gone
beyond
the
reach
of
her
voice
and
its
silence
puzzled
her
and
then
in
a
flash
it
came
to
them
both
that
the
pack
or
the
single
wolf
whose
cry
they
had
heard
was
very
near
them
the
scent
was
warm
a
few
moments
later
kazan
saw
a
moving
object
in
the
moonlight
it
was
followed
by
another
and
still
another
until
there
were
five
slouching
in
a
about
them
seventy
yards
away
then
they
laid
themselves
flat
in
the
snow
and
were
motionless
a
snarl
turned
kazan
eyes
to
gray
wolf
his
blind
mate
had
drawn
back
her
white
fangs
gleamed
menacingly
in
the
starlight
her
ears
were
flat
kazan
was
puzzled
why
was
she
signaling
danger
to
him
when
it
was
the
wolf
and
not
the
lynx
out
there
in
the
snow
and
why
did
the
wolves
not
come
in
and
feast
slowly
he
moved
toward
them
and
gray
wolf
called
to
him
with
her
whine
he
paid
no
attention
to
her
but
went
on
stepping
lightly
his
head
high
in
the
air
his
spine
bristling
in
the
scent
of
the
strangers
kazan
was
catching
something
now
that
was
strangely
familiar
it
drew
him
toward
them
more
swiftly
and
when
at
last
he
stopped
twenty
yards
from
where
the
little
group
lay
flattened
in
the
snow
his
thick
brush
waved
slightly
one
of
the
animals
sprang
up
and
approached
the
others
followed
and
in
another
moment
kazan
was
in
the
midst
of
them
smelling
and
smelled
and
wagging
his
tail
they
were
dogs
and
not
wolves
in
some
lonely
cabin
in
the
wilderness
their
master
had
died
and
they
had
taken
to
the
forests
they
still
bore
signs
of
the
about
their
necks
were
collars
the
hair
was
worn
short
at
their
flanks
and
one
still
dragged
after
him
three
feet
of
corded
babiche
trace
their
eyes
gleamed
red
and
hungry
in
the
glow
of
the
moon
and
the
stars
they
were
thin
and
gaunt
and
starved
and
kazan
suddenly
turned
and
trotted
ahead
of
them
to
the
side
of
the
dead
bull
then
he
fell
back
and
sat
proudly
on
his
haunches
beside
gray
wolf
listening
to
the
snapping
of
jaws
and
the
rending
of
flesh
as
the
starved
pack
feasted
gray
wolf
slunk
closer
to
kazan
she
muzzled
his
neck
and
kazan
gave
her
a
swift
caress
of
his
tongue
assuring
her
that
all
was
well
she
flattened
herself
in
the
snow
when
the
dogs
had
finished
and
came
up
in
their
dog
way
to
sniff
at
her
and
make
closer
acquaintance
with
kazan
kazan
towered
over
her
guarding
her
one
huge
dog
who
still
dragged
the
bit
of
babiche
trace
muzzled
gray
wolf
soft
neck
for
a
fraction
of
a
second
too
long
and
kazan
uttered
a
savage
snarl
of
warning
the
dog
drew
back
and
for
a
moment
their
fangs
gleamed
over
gray
wolf
blind
face
it
was
the
challenge
of
the
breed
the
big
husky
was
the
leader
of
the
pack
and
if
one
of
the
other
dogs
had
snarled
at
him
as
kazan
snarled
he
would
have
leaped
at
his
throat
but
in
kazan
standing
fierce
and
half
wild
over
gray
wolf
he
recognized
none
of
the
serfdom
of
the
it
was
master
facing
master
in
kazan
it
was
more
than
that
for
he
was
gray
wolf
mate
in
an
instant
more
he
would
have
leaped
over
her
body
to
have
fought
for
her
more
than
for
the
right
of
leadership
but
the
big
husky
turned
away
sullenly
growling
still
snarling
and
vented
his
rage
by
nipping
fiercely
at
the
flank
of
one
of
his
gray
wolf
understood
what
had
happened
though
she
could
not
see
she
shrank
closer
to
kazan
she
knew
that
the
moon
and
the
stars
had
looked
down
on
that
thing
that
always
meant
death
the
challenge
to
the
right
of
mate
with
her
luring
coyness
whining
and
softly
muzzling
his
shoulder
and
neck
she
tried
to
draw
kazan
away
from
the
circle
in
which
the
bull
lay
kazan
answer
was
an
ominous
rolling
of
smothered
thunder
deep
down
in
his
throat
he
lay
down
beside
her
licked
her
blind
face
swiftly
and
faced
the
stranger
dogs
the
moon
sank
lower
and
lower
and
at
last
dropped
behind
the
western
forests
the
stars
grew
paler
one
by
one
they
faded
from
the
sky
and
after
a
time
there
followed
the
cold
gray
dawn
of
the
north
in
that
dawn
the
big
husky
leader
rose
from
the
hole
he
had
made
in
the
snow
and
returned
to
the
bull
kazan
alert
was
on
his
feet
in
an
instant
and
stood
also
close
to
the
bull
the
two
circled
ominously
their
heads
lowered
their
crests
bristling
the
husky
drew
away
and
kazan
crouched
at
the
bull
neck
and
began
tearing
at
the
frozen
flesh
he
was
not
hungry
but
in
this
way
he
showed
his
right
to
the
flesh
his
defiance
of
the
right
of
the
big
husky
for
a
few
seconds
he
forgot
gray
wolf
the
husky
had
slipped
back
like
a
shadow
and
now
he
stood
again
over
gray
wolf
sniffing
her
neck
and
body
then
he
whined
in
that
whine
were
the
passion
the
invitation
the
demand
of
the
wild
so
quickly
that
the
eye
could
scarcely
follow
her
movement
faithful
gray
wolf
sank
her
gleaming
fangs
in
the
shoulder
a
gray
streak
nothing
more
tangible
than
a
streak
of
gray
silent
and
terrible
shot
through
the
it
was
kazan
he
came
without
a
snarl
without
a
cry
and
in
a
moment
he
and
the
husky
were
in
the
throes
of
terrific
battle
the
four
other
huskies
ran
in
quickly
and
stood
waiting
a
dozen
paces
from
the
combatants
gray
wolf
lay
crouched
on
her
belly
the
giant
husky
and
the
were
not
fighting
like
or
wolf
for
a
few
moments
rage
and
hatred
made
them
fight
like
mongrels
both
had
holds
now
one
was
down
and
now
the
other
and
so
swiftly
did
they
change
their
positions
that
the
four
waiting
were
puzzled
and
stood
motionless
under
other
conditions
they
would
have
leaped
upon
the
first
of
the
fighters
to
be
thrown
upon
his
back
and
torn
him
to
pieces
that
was
the
way
of
the
wolf
and
the
but
now
they
stood
back
hesitating
and
fearful
the
big
husky
had
never
been
beaten
in
battle
great
dane
ancestors
had
given
him
a
huge
bulk
and
a
jaw
that
could
crush
an
ordinary
dog
head
but
in
kazan
he
was
meeting
not
only
the
dog
and
the
wolf
but
all
that
was
best
in
the
two
and
kazan
had
the
advantage
of
a
few
hours
of
rest
and
a
full
stomach
more
than
that
he
was
fighting
for
gray
wolf
his
fangs
had
sunk
deep
in
the
husky
shoulder
and
the
husky
long
teeth
met
through
the
hide
and
flesh
of
his
neck
an
inch
deeper
and
they
would
have
pierced
his
jugular
kazan
knew
this
as
he
crunched
his
enemy
and
every
instant
even
in
their
fiercest
struggling
he
was
guarding
against
a
second
and
more
successful
lunge
of
those
powerful
jaws
at
last
the
lunge
came
and
quicker
than
the
wolf
itself
kazan
freed
himself
and
leaped
back
his
chest
dripped
blood
but
he
did
not
feel
the
hurt
they
began
slowly
to
circle
and
now
the
watching
drew
a
step
or
two
nearer
and
their
jaws
drooled
nervously
and
their
red
eyes
glared
as
they
waited
for
the
fatal
moment
their
eyes
were
on
the
big
husky
he
became
the
pivot
of
kazan
wider
circle
now
and
he
limped
as
he
turned
his
shoulder
was
broken
his
ears
were
flattened
as
he
watched
kazan
kazan
ears
were
erect
and
his
feet
touched
the
snow
lightly
all
his
fighting
cleverness
and
all
his
caution
had
returned
to
him
the
blind
rage
of
a
few
moments
was
gone
and
he
fought
now
as
he
had
fought
his
deadliest
enemy
the
lynx
five
times
he
circled
around
the
husky
and
then
like
a
shot
he
was
in
sending
his
whole
weight
against
the
husky
shoulder
with
the
momentum
of
a
leap
behind
it
this
time
he
did
not
try
for
a
hold
but
slashed
at
the
husky
jaws
it
was
the
deadliest
of
all
attacks
when
that
merciless
tribunal
of
death
stood
waiting
for
the
first
fall
of
the
vanquished
the
huge
dog
was
thrown
from
his
feet
for
a
fatal
moment
he
rolled
upon
his
side
and
in
the
moment
his
four
were
upon
him
all
of
their
hatred
of
the
weeks
and
months
in
which
the
leader
had
bullied
them
in
the
traces
was
concentrated
upon
him
now
and
he
was
literally
torn
into
pieces
kazan
pranced
to
gray
wolf
side
and
with
a
joyful
whine
she
laid
her
head
over
his
neck
twice
he
had
fought
the
fight
of
death
for
her
twice
he
had
won
and
in
her
blindness
gray
wolf
soul
if
soul
she
had
rose
in
exultation
to
the
cold
gray
sky
and
her
breast
panted
against
kazan
shoulder
as
she
listened
to
the
crunching
of
fangs
in
the
flesh
and
bone
of
the
foe
her
lord
and
master
had
overthrown
chapter
xvi
the
call
followed
days
of
feasting
on
the
frozen
flesh
of
the
old
bull
in
vain
gray
wolf
tried
to
lure
kazan
off
into
the
forests
and
the
swamps
day
by
day
the
temperature
rose
there
was
hunting
now
and
gray
wolf
wanted
to
be
alone
with
kazan
but
with
kazan
as
with
most
men
leadership
and
power
roused
new
sensations
and
he
was
the
leader
of
the
as
he
had
once
been
a
leader
among
the
wolves
not
only
gray
wolf
followed
at
his
flank
now
but
the
four
huskies
trailed
behind
him
once
more
he
was
experiencing
that
triumph
and
strange
thrill
that
he
had
almost
forgotten
and
only
gray
wolf
in
that
eternal
night
of
her
blindness
felt
with
dread
foreboding
the
danger
into
which
his
newly
achieved
czarship
might
lead
him
for
three
days
and
three
nights
they
remained
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
dead
moose
ready
to
defend
it
against
others
and
yet
each
day
and
each
night
growing
less
vigilant
in
their
guard
then
came
the
fourth
night
on
which
they
killed
a
young
doe
kazan
led
in
that
chase
and
for
the
first
time
in
the
excitement
of
having
the
pack
at
his
back
he
left
his
blind
mate
behind
when
they
came
to
the
kill
he
was
the
first
to
leap
at
its
soft
throat
and
not
until
he
had
begun
to
tear
at
the
doe
flesh
did
the
others
dare
to
eat
he
was
master
he
could
send
them
back
with
a
snarl
at
the
gleam
of
his
fangs
they
crouched
quivering
on
their
bellies
in
the
snow
kazan
blood
was
fomented
with
brute
exultation
and
the
excitement
and
fascination
that
came
in
the
possession
of
new
power
took
the
place
of
gray
wolf
each
day
a
little
more
she
came
in
half
an
hour
after
the
kill
and
there
was
no
longer
the
lithesome
alertness
to
her
slender
legs
or
gladness
in
the
tilt
of
her
ears
or
the
poise
of
her
head
she
did
not
eat
much
of
the
doe
her
blind
face
was
turned
always
in
direction
wherever
he
moved
she
followed
with
her
unseeing
eyes
as
if
expecting
each
moment
his
old
signal
to
her
that
low
that
had
called
to
her
so
often
when
they
were
alone
in
the
wilderness
in
kazan
as
leader
of
the
pack
there
was
working
a
curious
change
if
his
mates
had
been
wolves
it
would
not
have
been
difficult
for
gray
wolf
to
have
lured
him
away
but
kazan
was
among
his
own
kind
he
was
a
dog
and
they
were
dogs
fires
that
had
burned
down
and
ceased
to
warm
him
flamed
up
in
him
anew
in
his
life
with
gray
wolf
one
thing
had
oppressed
him
as
it
could
not
oppress
her
and
that
thing
was
loneliness
nature
had
created
him
of
that
kind
which
requires
companionship
not
of
one
but
of
many
it
had
given
him
birth
that
he
might
listen
to
and
obey
the
commands
of
the
voice
of
man
he
had
grown
to
hate
men
but
of
the
dogs
his
kind
he
was
a
part
he
had
been
happy
with
gray
wolf
happier
than
he
had
ever
been
in
the
companionship
of
men
and
his
but
he
had
been
a
long
time
separated
from
the
life
that
had
once
been
his
and
the
call
of
blood
made
him
for
a
time
forget
and
only
gray
wolf
with
that
wonderful
which
nature
was
giving
her
in
place
of
her
lost
sight
foresaw
the
end
to
which
it
was
leading
him
each
day
the
temperature
continued
to
rise
until
when
the
sun
was
warmest
the
snow
began
to
thaw
a
little
this
was
two
weeks
after
the
fight
near
the
bull
gradually
the
pack
had
swung
eastward
until
it
was
now
fifty
miles
east
and
twenty
miles
south
of
the
old
home
under
the
windfall
more
than
ever
gray
wolf
began
to
long
for
their
old
nest
under
the
fallen
trees
again
with
those
first
promises
of
spring
in
sunshine
and
air
there
was
coming
also
for
the
second
time
in
her
life
the
promise
of
approaching
motherhood
but
her
efforts
to
draw
kazan
back
were
unavailing
and
in
spite
of
her
protest
he
wandered
each
day
a
little
farther
east
and
south
at
the
head
of
his
pack
instinct
impelled
the
four
huskies
to
move
in
that
direction
they
had
not
yet
been
long
enough
a
part
of
the
wild
to
forget
the
necessity
of
man
and
in
that
direction
there
was
man
in
that
direction
and
not
far
from
them
now
was
the
hudson
bay
company
post
to
which
they
and
their
dead
master
owed
their
allegiance
kazan
did
not
know
this
but
one
day
something
happened
to
bring
back
visions
and
desires
that
widened
still
more
the
gulf
between
him
and
gray
wolf
they
had
come
to
the
cap
of
a
ridge
when
something
stopped
them
it
was
a
man
voice
crying
shrilly
that
word
of
long
ago
that
had
so
often
stirred
the
blood
in
kazan
own
veins
and
from
the
ridge
they
looked
down
upon
the
open
space
of
the
plain
where
a
team
of
six
dogs
was
trotting
ahead
of
a
sledge
with
a
man
running
behind
them
urging
them
on
at
every
other
step
with
that
cry
of
trembling
and
undecided
the
four
huskies
and
the
stood
on
the
ridge
with
gray
wolf
cringing
behind
them
not
until
man
and
dogs
and
sledge
had
disappeared
did
they
move
and
then
they
trotted
down
to
the
trail
and
sniffed
at
it
whiningly
and
excitedly
for
a
mile
or
two
they
followed
it
kazan
and
his
mates
going
fearlessly
in
the
trail
gray
wolf
hung
back
traveling
twenty
yards
to
the
right
of
them
with
the
hot
driving
the
blood
feverishly
through
her
brain
only
her
love
for
kazan
and
the
faith
she
still
had
in
him
kept
her
that
near
at
the
edge
of
a
swamp
kazan
halted
and
turned
away
from
the
trail
with
the
desire
that
was
growing
in
him
there
was
still
that
old
suspicion
which
nothing
could
quite
wipe
out
the
suspicion
that
was
an
inheritance
of
his
of
wolf
gray
wolf
whined
joyfully
when
he
turned
into
the
forest
and
drew
so
close
to
him
that
her
shoulder
rubbed
against
kazan
as
they
traveled
side
by
side
the
slush
snows
followed
fast
after
this
and
the
slush
snows
meant
spring
and
the
emptying
of
the
wilderness
of
human
life
kazan
and
his
mates
soon
began
to
scent
the
presence
and
the
movement
of
this
life
they
were
now
within
thirty
miles
of
the
post
for
a
hundred
miles
on
all
sides
of
them
the
trappers
were
moving
in
with
their
late
catch
of
furs
from
east
and
west
south
and
north
all
trails
led
to
the
post
the
pack
was
caught
in
the
mesh
of
them
for
a
week
not
a
day
passed
that
they
did
not
cross
a
fresh
trail
and
sometimes
two
or
three
gray
wolf
was
haunted
by
constant
fear
in
her
blindness
she
knew
that
they
were
surrounded
by
the
menace
of
men
to
kazan
what
was
coming
to
pass
had
more
and
more
ceased
to
fill
him
with
fear
and
caution
three
times
that
week
he
heard
the
shouts
of
men
and
once
he
heard
a
white
man
laughter
and
the
barking
of
dogs
as
their
master
tossed
them
their
daily
feed
of
fish
in
the
air
he
caught
the
pungent
scent
of
and
one
night
in
the
far
distance
he
heard
a
wild
snatch
of
song
followed
by
the
yelping
and
barking
of
a
slowly
and
surely
the
lure
of
man
drew
him
nearer
to
the
post
a
mile
two
miles
but
always
nearer
and
gray
wolf
fighting
her
losing
fight
to
the
end
sensed
in
the
air
the
nearness
of
that
hour
when
he
would
respond
to
the
final
call
and
she
would
be
left
alone
these
were
days
of
activity
and
excitement
at
the
fur
company
post
the
days
of
accounting
of
profit
and
of
pleasure
the
days
when
the
wilderness
poured
in
its
treasure
of
fur
to
be
sent
a
little
later
to
london
and
paris
and
the
capitals
of
europe
and
this
year
there
was
more
than
the
usual
interest
in
the
foregathering
of
the
forest
people
the
plague
had
wrought
its
terrible
havoc
and
not
until
the
had
come
to
answer
to
the
spring
would
it
be
known
accurately
who
had
lived
and
who
had
died
the
chippewans
and
from
the
south
began
to
arrive
first
with
their
teams
of
mongrel
curs
picked
up
along
the
borders
of
civilization
close
after
them
came
the
hunters
from
the
western
barren
lands
bringing
with
them
loads
of
white
fox
and
caribou
skins
and
an
army
of
mackenzie
hounds
that
pulled
like
horses
and
wailed
like
whipped
puppies
when
the
huskies
and
eskimo
dogs
set
upon
them
packs
of
fierce
labrador
dogs
never
vanquished
except
by
death
came
from
close
to
hudson
bay
team
after
team
of
little
yellow
and
gray
eskimo
dogs
as
quick
with
their
fangs
as
were
their
black
and
masters
with
their
hands
and
feet
met
the
much
larger
and
malemutes
from
the
athabasca
enemies
of
all
these
packs
of
fierce
huskies
trailed
in
from
all
sides
fighting
snapping
and
snarling
with
the
lust
of
killing
deep
born
in
them
from
their
wolf
progenitors
there
was
no
cessation
in
the
battle
of
the
fangs
it
began
with
the
first
brute
arrivals
it
continued
from
dawn
through
the
day
and
around
the
at
night
there
was
never
an
end
to
the
strife
between
the
dogs
and
between
the
men
and
the
dogs
the
snow
was
trailed
and
stained
with
blood
and
the
scent
of
it
added
greater
fierceness
to
the
half
a
dozen
battles
were
fought
to
the
death
each
day
and
night
those
that
died
were
chiefly
the
curs
mixtures
of
mastiff
great
dane
and
and
the
fatally
slow
mackenzie
hounds
about
the
post
rose
the
smoke
of
a
hundred
and
about
these
fires
gathered
the
women
and
the
children
of
the
hunters
when
the
snow
was
no
longer
fit
for
sledging
williams
the
factor
noted
that
there
were
many
who
had
not
come
and
the
accounts
of
these
he
later
scratched
out
of
his
ledgers
knowing
that
they
were
victims
of
the
plague
at
last
came
the
night
of
the
big
carnival
for
weeks
and
months
women
and
children
and
men
had
been
looking
forward
to
this
in
scores
of
forest
cabins
in
tepees
and
even
in
the
frozen
homes
of
the
little
eskimos
anticipation
of
this
wild
night
of
pleasure
had
given
an
added
zest
to
life
it
was
the
big
circus
the
good
time
given
twice
each
year
by
the
company
to
its
people
this
year
to
offset
the
memory
of
plague
and
death
the
factor
had
put
forth
unusual
exertions
his
hunters
had
killed
four
fat
caribou
in
the
clearing
there
were
great
piles
of
dry
logs
and
in
the
center
of
all
there
rose
eight
crotched
at
the
top
and
from
crotch
to
crotch
there
rested
a
stout
sapling
stripped
of
bark
and
on
each
sapling
was
spitted
the
carcass
of
a
caribou
to
be
roasted
whole
by
the
heat
of
the
fire
beneath
the
fires
were
lighted
at
dusk
and
williams
himself
started
the
first
of
those
wild
songs
of
the
northland
the
song
of
the
caribou
as
the
flames
leaped
up
into
the
dark
night
oh
ze
ze
he
roas
on
high
jes
under
ze
sky
beeg
white
now
he
yelled
now
all
together
and
carried
away
by
his
enthusiasm
the
forest
people
awakened
from
their
silence
of
months
and
the
song
burst
forth
in
a
savage
frenzy
that
reached
to
the
skies
two
miles
to
the
south
and
west
that
first
thunder
of
human
voice
reached
the
ears
of
kazan
and
gray
wolf
and
the
masterless
huskies
and
with
the
voices
of
men
they
heard
now
the
excited
howlings
of
dogs
the
huskies
faced
the
direction
of
the
sounds
moving
restlessly
and
whining
for
a
few
moments
kazan
stood
as
though
carven
of
rock
then
he
turned
his
head
and
his
first
look
was
to
gray
wolf
she
had
slunk
back
a
dozen
feet
and
lay
crouched
under
the
thick
cover
of
a
balsam
shrub
her
body
legs
and
neck
were
flattened
in
the
snow
she
made
no
sound
but
her
lips
were
drawn
back
and
her
teeth
shone
white
kazan
trotted
back
to
her
sniffed
at
her
blind
face
and
whined
gray
wolf
still
did
not
move
he
returned
to
the
dogs
and
his
jaws
opened
and
closed
with
a
snap
still
more
clearly
came
the
wild
voice
of
the
carnival
and
no
longer
to
be
held
back
by
kazan
leadership
the
four
huskies
dropped
their
heads
and
slunk
like
shadows
in
its
direction
kazan
hesitated
urging
gray
wolf
but
not
a
muscle
of
gray
wolf
body
moved
she
would
have
followed
him
in
face
of
fire
but
not
in
face
of
man
not
a
sound
escaped
her
ears
she
heard
the
quick
fall
of
feet
as
he
left
her
in
another
moment
she
knew
that
he
was
gone
then
and
not
until
then
did
she
lift
her
head
and
from
her
soft
throat
there
broke
a
whimpering
cry
it
was
her
last
call
to
kazan
but
stronger
than
that
there
was
running
through
kazan
excited
blood
the
call
of
man
and
of
dog
the
huskies
were
far
in
advance
of
him
now
and
for
a
few
moments
he
raced
madly
to
overtake
them
then
he
slowed
down
until
he
was
trotting
and
a
hundred
yards
farther
on
he
stopped
less
than
a
mile
away
he
could
see
where
the
flames
of
the
great
fires
were
reddening
the
sky
he
gazed
back
to
see
if
gray
wolf
was
following
and
then
went
on
until
he
struck
an
open
and
hard
traveled
trail
it
was
beaten
with
the
footprints
of
men
and
dogs
and
over
it
two
of
the
caribou
had
been
dragged
a
day
or
two
before
at
last
he
came
to
the
thinned
out
strip
of
timber
that
surrounded
the
clearing
and
the
flare
of
the
flames
was
in
his
eyes
the
bedlam
of
sound
that
came
to
him
now
was
like
fire
in
his
brain
he
heard
the
song
and
the
laughter
of
men
the
shrill
cries
of
women
and
children
the
barking
and
snarling
and
fighting
of
a
hundred
dogs
he
wanted
to
rush
out
and
join
them
to
become
again
a
part
of
what
he
had
once
been
yard
by
yard
he
sneaked
through
the
thin
timber
until
he
reached
the
edge
of
the
clearing
there
he
stood
in
the
shadow
of
a
spruce
and
looked
out
upon
life
as
he
had
once
lived
it
trembling
wistful
and
yet
hesitating
in
that
final
moment
a
hundred
yards
away
was
the
savage
circle
of
men
and
dogs
and
fire
his
nostrils
were
filled
with
the
rich
aroma
of
the
roasting
caribou
and
as
he
crouched
down
still
with
that
wolfish
caution
that
gray
wolf
had
taught
him
men
with
long
poles
brought
the
huge
carcasses
crashing
down
upon
the
melting
snow
about
the
fires
in
one
great
rush
the
horde
of
wild
revelers
crowded
in
with
bared
knives
and
a
snarling
mass
of
dogs
closed
in
behind
them
in
another
moment
he
had
forgotten
gray
wolf
had
forgotten
all
that
man
and
the
wild
had
taught
him
and
like
a
gray
streak
was
across
the
open
the
dogs
were
surging
back
when
he
reached
them
with
half
a
dozen
of
the
factor
men
lashing
them
in
the
faces
with
long
whips
the
sting
of
a
lash
fell
in
a
fierce
cut
over
an
eskimo
dog
shoulder
and
in
snapping
at
the
lash
his
fangs
struck
kazan
rump
with
lightning
swiftness
kazan
returned
the
cut
and
in
an
instant
the
jaws
of
the
dogs
had
met
in
another
instant
they
were
down
and
kazan
had
the
eskimo
dog
by
the
throat
with
shouts
the
men
rushed
in
again
and
again
their
whips
cut
like
knives
through
the
air
their
blows
fell
on
kazan
who
was
uppermost
and
as
he
felt
the
burning
pain
of
the
scourging
whips
there
flooded
through
him
all
at
once
the
fierce
memory
of
the
days
of
old
the
days
of
the
club
and
the
lash
he
snarled
slowly
he
loosened
his
hold
of
the
eskimo
dog
throat
and
then
out
of
the
mêlée
of
dogs
and
men
there
sprang
another
man
a
it
fell
on
kazan
back
and
the
force
of
it
sent
him
flat
into
the
snow
it
was
raised
again
behind
the
club
there
was
a
face
a
brutal
face
it
was
such
a
face
that
had
driven
kazan
into
the
wild
and
as
the
club
fell
again
he
evaded
the
full
weight
of
its
blow
and
his
fangs
gleamed
like
ivory
knives
a
third
time
the
club
was
raised
and
this
time
kazan
met
it
in
and
his
teeth
ripped
the
length
of
the
man
forearm
good
god
shrieked
the
man
in
pain
and
kazan
caught
the
gleam
of
a
rifle
barrel
as
he
sped
toward
the
forest
a
shot
followed
something
like
a
coal
ran
the
length
of
kazan
hip
and
deep
in
the
forest
he
stopped
to
lick
at
the
burning
furrow
where
the
bullet
had
gone
just
deep
enough
to
take
the
skin
and
hair
from
his
flesh
gray
wolf
was
still
waiting
under
the
balsam
shrub
when
kazan
returned
to
her
joyously
she
sprang
forth
to
meet
him
once
more
the
man
had
sent
back
the
old
kazan
to
her
he
muzzled
her
neck
and
face
and
stood
for
a
few
moments
with
his
head
resting
across
her
back
listening
to
the
distant
sound
then
with
ears
laid
flat
he
set
out
straight
into
the
north
and
west
and
now
gray
wolf
ran
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
him
like
the
gray
wolf
of
the
days
before
the
came
for
that
wonderful
thing
that
lay
beyond
the
realm
of
reason
told
her
that
once
more
she
was
comrade
and
mate
and
that
their
trail
that
night
was
leading
to
their
old
home
under
the
windfall
chapter
xvii
his
son
it
happened
that
kazan
was
to
remember
three
things
above
all
others
he
could
never
quite
forget
his
old
days
in
the
traces
though
they
were
growing
more
shadowy
and
indistinct
in
his
memory
as
the
summers
and
the
winters
passed
like
a
dream
there
came
to
him
a
memory
of
the
time
he
had
gone
down
to
civilization
like
dreams
were
the
visions
that
rose
before
him
now
and
then
of
the
face
of
the
first
woman
and
of
the
faces
of
masters
who
to
him
had
lived
ages
ago
and
never
would
he
quite
forget
the
fire
and
his
fights
with
man
and
beast
and
his
long
chases
in
the
moonlight
but
two
things
were
always
with
him
as
if
they
had
been
but
yesterday
rising
clear
and
unforgetable
above
all
others
like
the
two
stars
in
the
north
that
never
lost
their
brilliance
one
was
woman
the
other
was
the
terrible
fight
of
that
night
on
the
top
of
the
sun
rock
when
the
lynx
had
blinded
forever
his
wild
mate
gray
wolf
certain
events
remain
indelibly
fixed
in
the
minds
of
men
and
so
in
a
not
very
different
way
they
remain
in
the
minds
of
beasts
it
takes
neither
brain
nor
reason
to
measure
the
depths
of
sorrow
or
of
happiness
and
kazan
in
his
unreasoning
way
knew
that
contentment
and
peace
a
full
stomach
and
caresses
and
kind
words
instead
of
blows
had
come
to
him
through
woman
and
that
comradeship
in
the
wilderness
faith
loyalty
and
devotion
were
a
part
of
gray
wolf
the
third
unforgetable
thing
was
about
to
occur
in
the
home
they
had
found
for
themselves
under
the
swamp
windfall
during
the
days
of
cold
and
famine
they
had
left
the
swamp
over
a
month
before
when
it
was
smothered
deep
in
snow
on
the
day
they
returned
to
it
the
sun
was
shining
warmly
in
the
first
glorious
days
of
spring
warmth
everywhere
big
and
small
there
were
the
rushing
torrents
of
melting
snows
and
the
crackle
of
crumbling
ice
the
dying
cries
of
thawing
rock
and
earth
and
tree
and
each
night
for
many
nights
past
the
cold
pale
glow
of
the
aurora
borealis
had
crept
farther
and
farther
toward
the
pole
in
fading
glory
so
early
as
this
the
poplar
buds
had
begun
to
swell
and
the
air
was
filled
with
the
sweet
odor
of
balsam
spruce
and
cedar
where
there
had
been
famine
and
death
and
stillness
six
weeks
before
kazan
and
gray
wolf
now
stood
at
the
edge
of
the
swamp
and
breathed
the
earthy
smells
of
spring
and
listened
to
the
sounds
of
life
over
their
heads
a
pair
of
fluttered
and
scolded
at
them
a
big
jay
sat
pluming
himself
in
the
sunshine
farther
in
they
heard
the
crack
of
a
stick
broken
under
a
heavy
hoof
from
the
ridge
behind
them
they
caught
the
raw
scent
of
a
mother
bear
busy
pulling
down
the
tender
poplar
buds
for
her
cubs
born
while
she
was
still
deep
in
her
winter
sleep
in
the
warmth
of
the
sun
and
the
sweetness
of
the
air
there
breathed
to
gray
wolf
the
mystery
of
matehood
and
of
motherhood
she
whined
softly
and
rubbed
her
blind
face
against
kazan
for
days
in
her
way
she
tried
to
tell
him
more
than
ever
she
wanted
to
curl
herself
up
in
that
warm
dry
nest
under
the
windfall
she
had
no
desire
to
hunt
the
crack
of
the
dry
stick
under
a
cloven
hoof
and
the
warm
scent
of
the
and
her
cubs
roused
none
of
the
old
instincts
in
her
she
wanted
to
curl
herself
up
in
the
old
windfall
and
wait
and
she
tried
hard
to
make
kazan
understand
her
desire
now
that
the
snow
was
gone
they
found
that
a
narrow
creek
lay
between
them
and
the
knoll
on
which
the
windfall
was
situated
gray
wolf
picked
up
her
ears
at
the
tumult
of
the
little
torrent
since
the
day
of
the
fire
when
kazan
and
she
had
saved
themselves
on
the
she
had
ceased
to
have
the
inherent
wolf
horror
of
water
she
followed
fearlessly
even
eagerly
behind
kazan
as
he
sought
a
place
where
they
could
ford
the
rushing
little
stream
on
the
other
side
kazan
could
see
the
big
windfall
gray
wolf
could
it
and
she
whined
joyously
with
her
blind
face
turned
toward
it
a
hundred
yards
up
the
stream
a
big
cedar
had
fallen
over
it
and
kazan
began
to
cross
for
a
moment
gray
wolf
hesitated
and
then
followed
side
by
side
they
trotted
to
the
windfall
with
their
heads
and
shoulders
in
the
dark
opening
to
their
nest
they
scented
the
air
long
and
cautiously
then
they
entered
kazan
heard
gray
wolf
as
she
flung
herself
down
on
the
dry
floor
of
the
snug
cavern
she
was
panting
not
from
exhaustion
but
because
she
was
filled
with
a
sensation
of
contentment
and
happiness
in
the
darkness
own
jaws
fell
apart
he
too
was
glad
to
get
back
to
their
old
home
he
went
to
gray
wolf
and
panting
still
harder
she
licked
his
face
it
had
but
one
meaning
and
kazan
understood
for
a
moment
he
lay
down
beside
her
listening
and
eyeing
the
opening
to
their
nest
then
he
began
to
sniff
about
the
log
walls
he
was
close
to
the
opening
when
a
sudden
fresh
scent
came
to
him
and
he
grew
rigid
and
his
bristles
stood
up
the
scent
was
followed
by
a
whimpering
babyish
chatter
a
porcupine
entered
the
opening
and
proceeded
to
advance
in
its
foolish
fashion
still
chattering
in
that
babyish
way
that
has
made
its
life
inviolable
at
the
hands
of
man
kazan
had
heard
that
sound
before
and
like
all
other
beasts
had
learned
to
ignore
the
presence
of
the
innocuous
creature
that
made
it
but
just
now
he
did
not
stop
to
consider
that
what
he
saw
was
a
porcupine
and
that
at
his
first
snarl
the
little
creature
would
waddle
away
as
fast
as
it
could
still
chattering
baby
talk
to
itself
his
first
reasoning
was
that
it
was
a
live
thing
invading
the
home
to
which
gray
wolf
and
he
had
just
returned
a
day
later
or
perhaps
an
hour
later
he
would
have
driven
it
back
with
a
growl
now
he
leaped
upon
it
a
wild
chattering
intermingled
with
squeaks
and
then
a
rising
staccato
of
howls
followed
the
attack
gray
wolf
sprang
to
the
opening
the
porcupine
was
rolled
up
in
a
ball
a
dozen
feet
away
and
she
could
hear
kazan
tearing
about
in
the
throes
of
the
direst
agony
that
can
befall
a
beast
of
the
forests
his
face
and
nose
were
a
mat
of
quills
for
a
few
moments
he
rolled
and
dug
in
the
wet
mold
and
earth
pawing
madly
at
the
things
that
pierced
his
flesh
then
he
set
off
like
all
dogs
will
who
have
come
into
contact
with
the
friendly
porcupine
and
raced
again
and
again
around
the
windfall
howling
at
every
jump
gray
wolf
took
the
matter
coolly
it
is
possible
that
at
times
there
are
moments
of
humor
in
the
lives
of
animals
if
so
she
saw
this
one
she
scented
the
porcupine
and
she
knew
that
kazan
was
full
of
quills
as
there
was
nothing
to
do
and
nothing
to
fight
she
sat
back
on
her
haunches
and
waited
pricking
up
her
ears
every
time
kazan
passed
her
in
his
mad
circuit
around
the
windfall
at
his
fourth
or
fifth
heat
the
porcupine
smoothed
itself
down
a
little
and
continuing
the
interrupted
thread
of
its
chatter
waddled
to
a
poplar
climbed
it
and
began
to
gnaw
the
tender
bark
from
a
limb
at
last
kazan
halted
before
gray
wolf
the
first
agony
of
a
hundred
little
needles
piercing
his
flesh
had
deadened
into
a
steady
burning
pain
gray
wolf
went
over
to
him
and
investigated
him
cautiously
with
her
teeth
she
seized
the
ends
of
two
or
three
of
the
quills
and
pulled
them
out
kazan
was
very
much
dog
now
he
gave
a
yelp
and
whimpered
as
gray
wolf
jerked
out
a
second
bunch
of
quills
then
he
flattened
himself
on
his
belly
stretched
out
his
forelegs
closed
his
eyes
and
without
any
other
sound
except
an
occasional
yelp
of
pain
allowed
gray
wolf
to
go
on
with
the
operation
fortunately
he
had
escaped
getting
any
of
the
quills
in
his
mouth
and
tongue
but
his
nose
and
jaws
were
soon
red
with
blood
for
an
hour
gray
wolf
kept
faithfully
at
her
task
and
by
the
end
of
that
time
had
succeeded
in
pulling
out
most
of
the
quills
a
few
still
remained
too
short
and
too
deeply
inbedded
for
her
to
extract
with
her
teeth
after
this
kazan
went
down
to
the
creek
and
buried
his
burning
muzzle
in
the
cold
water
this
gave
him
some
relief
but
only
for
a
short
time
the
quills
that
remained
worked
their
way
deeper
and
deeper
into
his
flesh
like
living
things
nose
and
lips
began
to
swell
blood
and
saliva
dripped
from
his
mouth
and
his
eyes
grew
red
two
hours
after
gray
wolf
had
retired
to
her
nest
under
the
windfall
a
quill
had
completely
pierced
his
lip
and
began
to
prick
his
tongue
in
desperation
kazan
chewed
viciously
upon
a
piece
of
wood
this
broke
and
crumpled
the
quill
and
destroyed
its
power
to
do
further
harm
nature
had
told
him
the
one
thing
to
do
to
save
himself
most
of
that
day
he
spent
in
gnawing
at
wood
and
crunching
mouthfuls
of
earth
and
mold
between
his
jaws
in
this
way
the
points
of
the
quills
were
dulled
and
broken
as
they
came
through
at
dusk
he
crawled
under
the
windfall
and
gray
wolf
gently
licked
his
muzzle
with
her
soft
cool
tongue
frequently
during
the
night
kazan
went
to
the
creek
and
found
relief
in
its
water
the
next
day
he
had
what
the
forest
people
call
porcupine
mumps
his
face
was
swollen
until
gray
wolf
would
have
laughed
if
she
had
been
human
and
not
blind
his
chops
bulged
like
cushions
his
eyes
were
mere
slits
when
he
went
out
into
the
day
he
blinked
for
he
could
see
scarcely
better
than
his
sightless
mate
but
the
pain
was
mostly
gone
the
night
that
followed
he
began
to
think
of
hunting
and
the
next
morning
before
it
was
yet
dawn
he
brought
a
rabbit
into
their
den
a
few
hours
later
he
would
have
brought
a
spruce
partridge
to
gray
wolf
but
just
as
he
was
about
to
spring
upon
his
feathered
prey
the
soft
chatter
of
a
porcupine
a
few
yards
away
brought
him
to
a
sudden
stop
few
things
could
make
kazan
drop
his
tail
but
that
inane
and
incoherent
prattle
of
the
little
spiked
beast
sent
him
off
at
with
his
tail
between
his
legs
as
man
abhors
and
evades
the
creeping
serpent
so
kazan
would
hereafter
evade
this
little
creature
of
the
forests
that
never
in
animal
history
has
been
known
to
lose
its
or
pick
a
quarrel
two
weeks
of
lengthening
days
of
increasing
warmth
of
sunshine
and
hunting
followed
kazan
adventure
with
the
porcupine
the
last
of
the
snow
went
rapidly
out
of
the
earth
began
to
spring
tips
of
green
the
vine
glistened
redder
each
day
the
poplar
buds
began
to
split
and
in
the
sunniest
spots
between
the
rocks
of
the
ridges
the
little
white
began
to
give
a
final
proof
that
spring
had
come
for
the
first
of
those
two
weeks
gray
wolf
hunted
frequently
with
kazan
they
did
not
go
far
the
swamp
was
alive
with
small
game
and
each
day
or
night
they
killed
fresh
meat
after
the
first
week
gray
wolf
hunted
less
then
came
the
soft
and
balmy
night
glorious
in
the
radiance
of
a
full
spring
moon
when
she
refused
to
leave
the
windfall
kazan
did
not
urge
her
instinct
made
him
understand
and
he
did
not
go
far
from
the
windfall
that
night
in
his
hunt
when
he
returned
he
brought
a
rabbit
came
then
the
night
when
from
the
darkest
corner
of
the
windfall
gray
wolf
warned
him
back
with
a
low
snarl
he
stood
in
the
opening
a
rabbit
between
his
jaws
he
took
no
offense
at
the
snarl
but
stood
for
a
moment
gazing
into
the
gloom
where
gray
wolf
had
hidden
herself
then
he
dropped
the
rabbit
and
lay
down
squarely
in
the
opening
after
a
little
he
rose
restlessly
and
went
outside
but
he
did
not
leave
the
windfall
it
was
day
when
he
reentered
he
sniffed
as
he
had
sniffed
once
before
a
long
time
ago
between
the
boulders
at
the
top
of
the
sun
rock
that
which
was
in
the
air
was
no
longer
a
mystery
to
him
he
came
nearer
and
gray
wolf
did
not
snarl
she
whined
coaxingly
as
he
touched
her
then
his
muzzle
found
something
else
it
was
soft
and
warm
and
made
a
queer
little
sniffling
sound
there
was
a
responsive
whine
in
his
throat
and
in
the
darkness
came
the
quick
soft
caress
of
gray
tongue
kazan
returned
to
the
sunshine
and
stretched
himself
out
before
the
door
of
the
windfall
his
jaws
dropped
open
for
he
was
filled
with
a
strange
contentment
chapter
xviii
the
education
of
robbed
once
of
the
joys
of
parenthood
by
the
murder
on
the
sun
rock
both
gray
wolf
and
kazan
were
different
from
what
they
would
have
been
had
the
big
gray
lynx
not
come
into
their
lives
at
that
time
as
if
it
were
but
yesterday
they
remembered
the
moonlit
night
when
the
lynx
brought
blindness
to
gray
wolf
and
destroyed
her
young
and
when
kazan
had
avenged
himself
and
his
mate
in
his
terrible
fight
to
the
death
with
their
enemy
and
now
with
that
soft
little
handful
of
life
snuggling
close
up
against
her
gray
wolf
saw
through
her
blind
eyes
the
tragic
picture
of
that
night
more
vividly
than
ever
and
she
quivered
at
every
sound
ready
to
leap
in
the
face
of
an
unseen
foe
to
rend
all
flesh
that
was
not
the
flesh
of
kazan
and
ceaselessly
the
slightest
sound
bringing
him
to
his
feet
kazan
watched
and
guarded
he
mistrusted
the
moving
shadows
the
snapping
of
a
twig
drew
back
his
upper
lip
his
fangs
gleamed
menacingly
when
the
soft
air
brought
a
strange
scent
in
him
too
the
memory
of
the
sun
rock
the
death
of
their
first
young
and
the
blinding
of
gray
wolf
had
given
birth
to
a
new
instinct
not
for
an
instant
was
he
off
his
guard
as
surely
as
one
expects
the
sun
to
rise
so
did
he
expect
that
sooner
or
later
their
deadly
enemy
would
creep
on
them
from
out
of
the
forest
in
another
hour
such
as
this
the
lynx
had
brought
death
the
lynx
had
brought
blindness
and
so
day
and
night
he
waited
and
watched
for
the
lynx
to
come
again
and
woe
unto
any
other
creature
of
flesh
and
blood
that
dared
approach
the
windfall
in
these
first
days
of
gray
wolf
motherhood
but
peace
had
spread
its
wings
of
sunshine
and
plenty
over
the
swamp
there
were
no
intruders
unless
the
noisy
the
the
chattering
bush
sparrows
and
the
and
ermine
could
be
called
such
after
the
first
day
or
two
kazan
went
more
frequently
into
the
windfall
and
though
more
than
once
he
nosed
searchingly
about
gray
wolf
he
could
find
only
the
one
little
pup
a
little
farther
west
the
would
have
called
the
pup
for
two
reasons
because
he
had
no
brothers
or
sisters
and
because
he
was
a
mixture
of
dog
and
wolf
he
was
a
sleek
and
lively
little
fellow
from
the
beginning
for
there
was
no
division
of
mother
strength
and
attention
he
developed
with
the
true
swiftness
of
the
and
not
with
the
slowness
of
the
for
three
days
he
was
satisfied
to
cuddle
close
against
his
mother
feeding
when
he
was
hungry
sleeping
a
great
deal
and
preened
and
laundered
almost
constantly
by
gray
wolf
affectionate
tongue
from
the
fourth
day
he
grew
busier
and
more
inquisitive
with
every
hour
he
found
his
mother
blind
face
with
tremendous
effort
he
tumbled
over
her
paws
and
once
he
lost
himself
completely
and
sniffled
for
help
when
he
rolled
fifteen
or
eighteen
inches
away
from
her
it
was
not
long
after
this
that
he
began
to
recognize
kazan
as
a
part
of
his
mother
and
he
was
scarcely
more
than
a
week
old
when
he
rolled
himself
up
contentedly
between
kazan
forelegs
and
went
to
sleep
kazan
was
puzzled
then
with
a
deep
sigh
gray
wolf
laid
her
head
across
one
of
her
forelegs
with
her
nose
touching
her
runaway
baby
and
seemed
vastly
contented
for
half
an
hour
kazan
did
not
move
when
he
was
ten
days
old
discovered
there
was
great
sport
in
tussling
with
a
bit
of
rabbit
fur
it
was
a
little
later
when
he
made
his
second
exciting
discovery
light
and
sunshine
the
sun
had
now
reached
a
point
where
in
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
a
bright
gleam
of
it
found
its
way
through
an
overhead
opening
in
the
windfall
at
first
would
only
stare
at
the
golden
streak
then
came
the
time
when
he
tried
to
play
with
it
as
he
played
with
the
rabbit
fur
each
day
thereafter
he
went
a
little
nearer
the
opening
through
which
kazan
passed
from
the
windfall
into
the
big
world
outside
finally
came
the
time
when
he
reached
the
opening
and
crouched
there
blinking
and
frightened
at
what
he
saw
and
now
gray
wolf
no
longer
tried
to
hold
him
back
but
went
out
into
the
sunshine
and
tried
to
call
him
to
her
it
was
three
days
before
his
weak
eyes
had
grown
strong
enough
to
permit
his
following
her
and
very
quickly
after
that
learned
to
love
the
sun
the
warm
air
and
the
sweetness
of
life
and
to
dread
the
darkness
of
the
den
where
he
had
been
born
that
this
world
was
not
altogether
so
nice
as
it
at
first
appeared
he
was
very
soon
to
learn
at
the
darkening
signs
of
an
approaching
storm
one
day
gray
wolf
tried
to
lure
him
back
under
the
windfall
it
was
her
first
warning
to
and
he
did
not
understand
where
gray
wolf
failed
nature
came
to
teach
a
first
lesson
was
caught
in
a
sudden
deluge
of
rain
it
flattened
him
out
in
pure
terror
and
he
was
drenched
and
half
drowned
before
gray
wolf
caught
him
between
her
jaws
and
carried
him
into
shelter
one
by
one
after
this
the
first
strange
experiences
of
life
came
to
him
and
one
by
one
his
instincts
received
their
birth
greatest
for
him
of
the
days
to
follow
was
that
on
which
his
inquisitive
nose
touched
the
raw
flesh
of
a
freshly
killed
and
bleeding
rabbit
it
was
his
first
taste
of
blood
it
was
sweet
it
filled
him
with
a
strange
excitement
and
thereafter
he
knew
what
it
meant
when
kazan
brought
in
something
between
his
jaws
he
soon
began
to
battle
with
sticks
in
place
of
the
soft
fur
and
his
teeth
grew
as
hard
and
as
sharp
as
little
needles
the
great
mystery
was
bared
to
him
at
last
when
kazan
brought
in
between
his
jaws
a
big
rabbit
that
was
still
alive
but
so
badly
crushed
that
it
could
not
run
when
dropped
to
the
ground
had
learned
to
know
what
rabbits
and
partridges
meant
the
sweet
warm
blood
that
he
loved
better
even
than
he
had
ever
loved
his
mother
milk
but
they
had
come
to
him
dead
he
had
never
seen
one
of
the
monsters
alive
and
now
the
rabbit
that
kazan
dropped
to
the
ground
kicking
and
struggling
with
a
broken
back
sent
back
appalled
for
a
few
moments
he
wonderingly
watched
the
dying
throes
of
kazan
prey
both
kazan
and
gray
wolf
seemed
to
understand
that
this
was
to
be
first
lesson
in
his
education
as
a
slaying
and
creature
and
they
stood
close
over
the
rabbit
making
no
effort
to
end
its
struggles
half
a
dozen
times
gray
wolf
sniffed
at
the
rabbit
and
then
turned
her
blind
face
toward
after
the
third
or
fourth
time
kazan
stretched
himself
out
on
his
belly
a
few
feet
away
and
watched
the
proceedings
attentively
each
time
that
gray
wolf
lowered
her
head
to
muzzle
the
rabbit
little
ears
shot
up
expectantly
when
he
saw
that
nothing
happened
and
that
his
mother
was
not
hurt
he
came
a
little
nearer
soon
he
could
reach
out
and
cautious
and
touch
the
furry
thing
that
was
not
yet
dead
in
a
last
spasmodic
convulsion
the
big
rabbit
doubled
up
its
rear
legs
and
gave
a
kick
that
sent
sprawling
back
yelping
in
terror
he
regained
his
feet
and
then
for
the
first
time
anger
and
the
desire
to
retaliate
took
possession
of
him
the
kick
had
completed
his
first
education
he
came
back
with
less
caution
but
and
a
moment
later
had
dug
his
tiny
teeth
in
the
rabbit
neck
he
could
feel
the
throb
of
life
in
the
soft
body
the
muscles
of
the
dying
rabbit
twitched
convulsively
under
him
and
he
hung
with
his
teeth
until
there
was
no
longer
a
tremor
of
life
in
his
first
kill
gray
wolf
was
delighted
she
caressed
with
her
tongue
and
even
kazan
condescended
to
sniff
approvingly
of
his
son
when
he
returned
to
the
rabbit
and
never
before
had
warm
sweet
blood
tasted
so
good
to
as
it
did
swiftly
developed
from
a
into
a
animal
one
by
one
the
mysteries
of
life
were
unfolded
to
him
the
chortle
of
the
gray
owl
the
crash
of
a
falling
tree
the
roll
of
thunder
the
rush
of
running
water
the
scream
of
a
the
mooing
of
the
cow
moose
and
the
distant
call
of
his
tribe
but
chief
of
all
these
mysteries
that
were
already
becoming
a
part
of
his
instinct
was
the
mystery
of
scent
one
day
he
wandered
fifty
yards
away
from
the
windfall
and
his
little
nose
touched
the
warm
scent
of
a
rabbit
instantly
without
reasoning
or
further
process
of
education
he
knew
that
to
get
at
the
sweet
flesh
and
blood
which
he
loved
he
must
follow
the
scent
he
wriggled
slowly
along
the
trail
until
he
came
to
a
big
log
over
which
the
rabbit
had
vaulted
in
a
long
leap
and
from
this
log
he
turned
back
each
day
after
this
he
went
on
adventures
of
his
own
at
first
he
was
like
an
explorer
without
a
compass
in
a
vast
and
unknown
world
each
day
he
encountered
something
new
always
wonderful
frequently
terrifying
but
his
terrors
grew
less
and
less
and
his
confidence
correspondingly
greater
as
he
found
that
none
of
the
things
he
feared
did
him
any
harm
he
became
more
and
more
bold
in
his
investigations
and
his
appearance
was
changing
as
well
as
his
view
of
things
his
round
body
was
taking
a
different
form
he
became
lithe
and
quick
the
yellow
of
his
coat
darkened
and
there
was
a
streak
along
his
back
like
that
along
kazan
he
had
his
mother
and
her
beautiful
grace
of
head
otherwise
he
was
a
true
son
of
kazan
his
limbs
gave
signs
of
future
strength
and
massiveness
he
was
broad
across
the
chest
his
eyes
were
wide
apart
with
a
little
red
in
the
lower
corners
the
forest
people
know
what
to
expect
of
husky
pups
who
early
develop
that
drop
of
red
it
is
a
warning
that
they
are
born
of
the
wild
and
that
their
mothers
or
fathers
are
of
the
savage
in
that
tinge
of
red
was
so
pronounced
that
it
could
mean
but
one
thing
while
he
was
almost
half
dog
the
wild
had
claimed
him
forever
not
until
the
day
of
his
first
real
battle
with
a
living
creature
did
come
fully
into
his
inheritance
he
had
gone
farther
than
usual
from
the
windfall
fully
a
hundred
yards
here
he
found
a
new
wonder
it
was
the
creek
he
had
heard
it
before
and
he
had
looked
down
on
it
from
afar
from
a
distance
of
fifty
yards
at
least
but
he
ventured
going
to
the
edge
of
it
and
there
he
stood
for
a
long
time
with
the
water
rippling
and
singing
at
his
feet
gazing
across
it
into
the
new
world
that
he
saw
then
he
moved
cautiously
along
the
stream
he
had
not
gone
a
dozen
steps
when
there
was
a
furious
fluttering
close
to
him
and
one
of
the
fierce
jays
of
the
northland
was
directly
in
his
path
it
could
not
fly
one
of
its
wings
dragged
probably
broken
in
a
struggle
with
some
one
of
the
smaller
preying
beasts
but
for
an
instant
it
was
a
most
startling
and
defiant
bit
of
life
to
then
the
grayish
crest
along
his
back
stiffened
and
he
advanced
the
wounded
jay
remained
motionless
until
was
within
three
feet
of
it
in
short
quick
hops
it
began
to
retreat
instantly
indecision
had
flown
to
the
four
winds
with
one
sharp
excited
yelp
he
flew
at
the
defiant
bird
for
a
few
moments
there
was
a
thrilling
race
and
sharp
little
teeth
buried
themselves
in
the
jay
feathers
swift
as
a
flash
the
bird
beak
began
to
strike
the
jay
was
the
king
of
the
smaller
birds
in
nesting
season
it
killed
the
brush
sparrows
the
and
the
again
and
again
it
struck
with
its
powerful
beak
but
the
son
of
kazan
had
now
reached
the
age
of
battle
and
the
pain
of
the
blows
only
made
his
own
teeth
sink
deeper
at
last
he
found
the
flesh
and
a
puppyish
snarl
rose
in
his
throat
fortunately
he
had
gained
a
hold
under
the
wing
and
after
the
first
dozen
blows
the
jay
resistance
grew
weaker
five
minutes
later
loosened
his
teeth
and
drew
back
a
step
to
look
at
the
crumpled
and
motionless
creature
before
him
the
jay
was
dead
he
had
won
his
first
battle
and
with
victory
came
the
wonderful
dawning
of
that
greatest
instinct
of
all
which
told
him
that
no
longer
was
he
a
drone
in
the
marvelous
mechanism
of
wilderness
life
but
a
part
of
it
from
this
time
forth
he
had
half
an
hour
later
gray
wolf
came
down
over
his
trail
the
jay
was
torn
into
bits
its
feathers
were
scattered
about
and
little
nose
was
bloody
was
lying
in
triumph
beside
his
victim
swiftly
gray
wolf
understood
and
caressed
him
joyously
when
they
returned
to
the
windfall
carried
in
his
jaws
what
was
left
of
the
jay
from
that
hour
of
his
first
kill
hunting
became
the
chief
passion
of
life
when
he
was
not
sleeping
in
the
sun
or
under
the
windfall
at
night
he
was
seeking
life
that
he
could
destroy
he
slaughtered
an
entire
family
of
were
at
first
the
easiest
for
him
to
stalk
and
he
killed
three
then
he
encountered
an
ermine
and
the
fierce
little
white
outlaw
of
the
forests
gave
him
his
first
defeat
defeat
cooled
his
ardor
for
a
few
days
but
taught
him
the
great
lesson
that
there
were
other
fanged
and
animals
besides
himself
and
that
nature
had
so
schemed
things
that
fang
must
not
prey
upon
fang
many
things
had
been
born
in
him
instinctively
he
shunned
the
porcupine
without
experiencing
the
torture
of
its
quills
he
came
face
to
face
with
a
one
day
a
fortnight
after
his
fight
with
the
ermine
both
were
seeking
food
and
as
there
was
no
food
between
them
to
fight
over
each
went
his
own
way
farther
and
farther
ventured
from
the
windfall
always
following
the
creek
sometimes
he
was
gone
for
hours
at
first
gray
wolf
was
restless
when
he
was
away
but
she
seldom
went
with
him
and
after
a
time
her
restlessness
left
her
nature
was
working
swiftly
it
was
kazan
who
was
restless
now
moonlight
nights
had
come
and
the
wanderlust
was
growing
more
and
more
insistent
in
his
veins
and
gray
wolf
too
was
filled
with
the
strange
longing
to
roam
at
large
out
into
the
big
world
came
then
the
afternoon
when
went
on
his
longest
hunt
half
a
mile
away
he
killed
his
first
rabbit
he
remained
beside
it
until
dusk
the
moon
rose
big
and
golden
flooding
the
forests
and
plains
and
ridges
with
a
light
almost
like
that
of
day
it
was
a
glorious
night
and
found
the
moon
and
left
his
kill
and
the
direction
in
which
he
traveled
away
from
the
all
that
night
gray
wolf
watched
and
waited
and
when
at
last
the
moon
was
sinking
into
the
south
and
west
she
settled
back
on
her
haunches
turned
her
blind
face
to
the
sky
and
sent
forth
her
first
howl
since
the
day
was
born
nature
had
come
into
her
own
far
away
heard
but
he
did
not
answer
a
new
world
was
his
he
had
said
to
the
windfall
and
home
chapter
xix
the
usurpers
it
was
that
glorious
season
between
spring
and
summer
when
the
northern
nights
were
brilliant
with
moon
and
stars
that
kazan
and
gray
wolf
set
up
the
valley
between
the
two
ridges
on
a
long
hunt
it
was
the
beginning
of
that
which
always
comes
to
the
furred
and
padded
creatures
of
the
wilderness
immediately
after
the
of
early
spring
have
left
their
mothers
to
find
their
own
way
in
the
big
world
they
struck
west
from
their
winter
home
under
the
windfall
in
the
swamp
they
hunted
mostly
at
night
and
behind
them
they
left
a
trail
marked
by
the
partly
eaten
carcasses
of
rabbits
and
partridges
it
was
the
season
of
slaughter
and
not
of
hunger
ten
miles
west
of
the
swamp
they
killed
a
fawn
this
too
they
left
after
a
single
meal
their
appetites
became
satiated
with
warm
flesh
and
blood
they
grew
sleek
and
fat
and
each
day
they
basked
longer
in
the
warm
sunshine
they
had
few
rivals
the
lynxes
were
in
the
heavier
timber
to
the
south
there
were
no
wolves
marten
and
mink
were
numerous
along
the
creek
but
these
were
neither
nor
one
day
they
came
upon
an
old
otter
he
was
a
giant
of
his
kind
turning
a
whitish
gray
with
the
approach
of
summer
kazan
grown
fat
and
lazy
watched
him
idly
blind
gray
wolf
sniffed
at
the
fishy
smell
of
him
in
the
air
to
them
he
was
no
more
than
a
floating
stick
a
creature
out
of
their
element
along
with
the
fish
and
they
continued
on
their
way
not
knowing
that
this
uncanny
creature
with
the
flappers
was
soon
to
become
their
ally
in
one
of
the
strange
and
deadly
feuds
of
the
wilderness
which
are
as
sanguinary
to
animal
life
as
the
deadliest
feuds
of
men
are
to
human
life
the
day
following
their
meeting
with
the
otter
gray
wolf
and
kazan
continued
three
miles
farther
westward
still
following
the
stream
here
they
encountered
the
interruption
to
their
progress
which
turned
them
over
the
northward
ridge
the
obstacle
was
a
huge
beaver
dam
the
dam
was
two
hundred
yards
in
width
and
flooded
a
mile
of
swamp
and
timber
above
it
neither
gray
wolf
nor
kazan
was
deeply
interested
in
beavers
they
also
moved
out
of
their
element
along
with
the
fish
and
the
otter
and
birds
so
they
turned
into
the
north
not
knowing
that
nature
had
already
schemed
that
they
four
the
dog
wolf
otter
and
beaver
should
soon
be
engaged
in
one
of
those
merciless
struggles
of
the
wild
which
keep
animal
life
down
to
the
survival
of
the
fittest
and
whose
tragic
histories
are
kept
secret
under
the
stars
and
the
moon
and
the
winds
that
tell
no
tales
for
many
years
no
man
had
come
into
this
valley
between
the
two
ridges
to
molest
the
beaver
if
a
sarcee
trapper
had
followed
down
the
nameless
creek
and
had
caught
the
patriarch
and
chief
of
the
colony
he
would
at
once
have
judged
him
to
be
very
old
and
his
indian
tongue
would
have
given
him
a
name
he
would
have
called
him
broken
tooth
because
one
of
the
four
long
teeth
with
which
he
felled
trees
and
built
dams
was
broken
off
six
years
before
broken
tooth
had
led
a
few
beavers
of
his
own
age
down
the
stream
and
they
had
built
their
first
small
dam
and
their
first
lodge
the
following
april
broken
tooth
mate
had
four
little
baby
beavers
and
each
of
the
other
mothers
in
the
colony
increased
the
population
by
two
or
three
or
four
at
the
end
of
the
fourth
year
this
first
generation
of
children
had
they
followed
the
usual
law
of
nature
would
have
mated
and
left
the
colony
to
build
a
dam
and
lodges
of
their
own
they
mated
but
did
not
emigrate
the
next
year
the
second
generation
of
children
now
four
years
old
mated
but
did
not
leave
so
that
in
this
early
summer
of
the
sixth
year
the
colony
was
very
much
like
a
great
city
that
had
been
long
besieged
by
an
enemy
it
numbered
fifteen
lodges
and
over
a
hundred
beavers
not
counting
the
fourth
babies
which
had
been
born
during
march
and
april
the
dam
had
been
lengthened
until
it
was
fully
two
hundred
yards
in
length
water
had
been
made
to
flood
large
areas
of
birch
and
poplar
and
tangled
swamps
of
tender
willow
and
elder
even
with
this
food
was
growing
scarce
and
the
lodges
were
overcrowded
this
was
because
beavers
are
almost
human
in
their
love
for
home
broken
tooth
lodge
was
fully
nine
feet
long
by
seven
wide
inside
and
there
were
now
living
in
it
children
and
grandchildren
to
the
number
of
for
this
reason
broken
tooth
was
preparing
to
break
the
precedent
of
his
tribe
when
kazan
and
gray
wolf
sniffed
carelessly
at
the
strong
scents
of
the
beaver
city
broken
tooth
was
marshaling
his
family
and
two
of
his
sons
and
their
families
for
the
exodus
as
yet
broken
tooth
was
the
recognized
leader
in
the
colony
no
other
beaver
had
grown
to
his
size
and
strength
his
thick
body
was
fully
three
feet
long
he
weighed
at
least
sixty
pounds
his
tail
was
fourteen
inches
in
length
and
five
in
width
and
on
a
still
night
he
could
strike
the
water
a
blow
that
could
be
heard
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
his
webbed
hindfeet
were
twice
as
large
as
his
mate
and
he
was
easily
the
swiftest
swimmer
in
the
colony
following
the
afternoon
when
gray
wolf
and
kazan
struck
into
the
north
came
the
clear
still
night
when
broken
tooth
climbed
to
the
top
of
the
dam
shook
himself
and
looked
down
to
see
that
his
army
was
behind
him
the
starlit
water
of
the
big
pond
rippled
and
flashed
with
the
movement
of
many
bodies
a
few
of
the
older
beavers
clambered
up
after
broken
tooth
and
the
old
patriarch
plunged
down
into
the
narrow
stream
on
the
other
side
of
the
dam
now
the
shining
silken
bodies
of
the
emigrants
followed
him
in
the
starlight
in
ones
and
twos
and
threes
they
climbed
over
the
dam
and
with
them
went
a
dozen
children
born
three
months
before
easily
and
swiftly
they
began
the
journey
the
youngsters
swimming
furiously
to
keep
up
with
their
parents
in
all
they
numbered
forty
broken
tooth
swam
well
in
the
lead
with
his
older
workers
and
battlers
behind
him
in
the
rear
followed
mothers
and
children
all
of
that
night
the
journey
continued
the
otter
their
deadliest
enemy
deadlier
even
than
man
hid
himself
in
a
thick
clump
of
willows
as
they
passed
nature
which
sometimes
sees
beyond
the
vision
of
man
had
made
him
the
enemy
of
these
creatures
that
were
passing
his
in
the
night
a
he
was
born
to
be
a
conserver
as
well
as
a
destroyer
of
the
creatures
on
which
he
fed
perhaps
nature
told
him
that
too
many
beaver
dams
stopped
the
run
of
spawning
fish
and
that
where
there
were
many
beavers
there
were
always
few
fish
maybe
he
reasoned
as
to
why
was
poor
and
he
went
hungry
so
unable
to
cope
singly
with
whole
tribes
of
his
enemies
he
worked
to
destroy
their
dams
how
this
in
turn
destroyed
the
beavers
will
be
seen
in
the
feud
in
which
nature
had
already
schemed
that
he
should
play
a
part
with
kazan
and
gray
wolf
a
dozen
times
during
this
night
broken
tooth
halted
to
investigate
the
food
supplies
along
the
banks
but
in
the
two
or
three
places
where
he
found
plenty
of
the
bark
on
which
they
lived
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
have
constructed
a
dam
his
wonderful
engineering
instincts
rose
even
above
food
instincts
and
when
each
time
he
moved
onward
no
beaver
questioned
his
judgment
by
remaining
behind
in
the
early
dawn
they
crossed
the
burn
and
came
to
the
edge
of
the
swamp
domain
of
kazan
and
gray
wolf
by
right
of
discovery
and
possession
that
swamp
belonged
to
the
dog
and
the
wolf
in
every
part
of
it
they
had
left
their
mark
of
ownership
but
broken
tooth
was
a
creature
of
the
water
and
the
scent
of
his
tribe
was
not
keen
he
led
on
traveling
more
slowly
when
they
entered
the
timber
just
below
the
windfall
home
of
kazan
and
gray
wolf
he
halted
and
clambering
ashore
balanced
himself
upright
on
his
webbed
hindfeet
and
broad
tail
here
he
had
found
ideal
conditions
a
dam
could
be
constructed
easily
across
the
narrow
stream
and
the
water
could
be
made
to
flood
a
big
supply
of
poplar
birch
willow
and
alder
also
the
place
was
sheltered
by
heavy
timber
so
that
the
winters
would
be
warm
broken
tooth
quickly
gave
his
followers
to
understand
that
this
was
to
be
their
new
home
on
both
sides
of
the
stream
they
swarmed
into
the
timber
the
babies
began
at
once
to
nibble
hungrily
at
the
tender
bark
of
willow
and
alder
the
older
ones
every
one
of
them
now
a
working
engineer
investigated
excitedly
breakfasting
by
nibbling
off
a
mouthful
of
bark
now
and
then
that
day
the
work
of
began
broken
tooth
himself
selected
a
big
birch
that
leaned
over
the
stream
and
began
the
work
of
cutting
through
the
butt
with
his
three
long
teeth
though
the
old
patriarch
had
lost
one
tooth
the
three
that
remained
had
not
deteriorated
with
age
the
outer
edge
of
them
was
formed
of
the
hardest
enamel
the
inner
side
was

entirely
around

he
worked
tirelessly
for
several
hours
and
when
at
last
he
stopped
to

another
workman
took
up
the
task
meanwhile
a
dozen
beavers
were
hard
at
work
cutting
timber
long
before

tooth
tree
was
ready
to
fall
across

a

poplar
crashed
into

was

while
the

prefers
to
do
most
of
his

at

he

broken

gave
his
tribe
but
little
rest
during
the
days
that
followed
with
almost
human
intelligence
the
little
engineers
kept
at
their
task
smaller
trees
were
felled
and
these
were
cut
into
four
or
five
foot
lengths
one
by
one
these
lengths
were
rolled
to
the
stream
the
beavers
pushing
them
with
their
heads
and
forepaws
and
by
means
of
brush
and
small
limbs
they
were
fastened
securely
against
the
birch
when
the
framework
was
completed
the
wonderful
cement
construction
was
begun
in
this
the
beavers
were
the
masters
of
men
dynamite
was
the
only
force
that
could
hereafter
break
up
what
they
were
building
now
under
their
chins
the
beavers
brought
from
the
banks
a
mixture
of
mud
and
fine
twigs
carrying
from
half
a
pound
to
a
pound
at
a
load
and
began
filling
up
the
framework
with
it
their
task
seemed
tremendous
and
yet
broken

engineers
could
carry
a
ton
of
this
mud
and
twig
mixture
during
a
day
and
night
in
three
days
the
water
was
beginning
to
back
until
it
rose
about
the
butts
of
a
dozen
or
more
trees
and
was
flooding
a
small
area
of
brush
this
made
work
easier
from
now
on
materials
could
be
cut
in
the
water
and
easily
floated
while
a
part
of
the
beaver
colony
was
taking
advantage
of
the
water
others
were
felling
trees
end
to
end
with
the

laying
the
working
frame
of
a
dam
a
hundred
feet
in
width
they
had
nearly
accomplished
this
work
when
one
morning
kazan
and
gray
wolf
returned
to
the
swamp
chapter
xx
a
feud
in
the
wilderness
a
soft
wind
blowing
from
the
south
and
east
brought
the
scent
of
the
invaders
to
gray
wolf
nose
when
they
were
still
half
a
mile
away
she
gave
the
warning
to
kazan
and
he
too
found
the
strange
scent
in
the
air
it
grew
stronger
as
they
advanced
when
two
hundred
yards
from
the
windfall
they
heard
the
sudden
crash
of
a
falling
tree
and
stopped
for
a
full
minute
they
stood
tense
and
listening
then
the
silence
was
broken
by
a
squeaking
cry
followed
by
a
splash
gray
wolf
alert
ears
fell
back
and
she
turned
her
blind
face
understandingly
toward
kazan
they
trotted
ahead
slowly
approaching
the
windfall
from
behind
not
until
they
had
reached
the
top
of
the
knoll
on
which
it
was
situated
did
kazan
begin
to
see
the
wonderful
change
that
had
taken
place
during
their
absence
astounded
they
stood
while
he
stared
there
was
no
longer
a
little
creek
below
them
where
it
had
been
was
a
pond
that
reached
almost
to
the
foot
of
the
knoll
it
was
fully
a
hundred
feet
in
width
and
the
backwater
had
flooded
the
trees
and
bush
for
five
or
six
times
that
distance
toward
the
burn
they
had
come
up
quietly
and
broken
tooth
workers
were
unaware
of
their
presence
not
fifty
feet
away
broken
tooth
himself
was
gnawing
at
the
butt
of
a
tree
an
equal
distance
to
the
right
of
him
four
or
five
of
the
baby
beavers
were
at
play
building
a
miniature
dam
of
mud
and
tiny
twigs
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
pond
was
a
steep
bank
six
or
seven
feet
high
and
here
a
few
of
the
older
children
two
years
old
but
still
not
workmen
were
having
great
fun
climbing
the
bank
and
using
it
as
a
it
was
their
splashing
that
kazan
and
gray
wolf
had
heard
in
a
dozen
different
places
the
older
beavers
were
at
work
a
few
weeks
before
kazan
had
looked
upon
a
similar
scene
when
he
had
returned
into
the
north
from
broken
tooth
old
home
it
had
not
interested
him
then
but
a
quick
and
thrilling
change
swept
through
him
now
the
beavers
had
ceased
to
be
mere
water
animals
uneatable
and
with
an
odor
that
displeased
him
they
were
invaders
and
enemies
his
fangs
bared
silently
his
crest
stiffened
like
the
hair
of
a
brush
and
the
muscles
of
his
forelegs
and
shoulders
stood
out
like
whipcords
not
a
sound
came
from
him
as
he
rushed
down
upon
broken
tooth
the
old
beaver
was
oblivious
of
danger
until
kazan
was
within
twenty
feet
of
him
naturally
slow
of
movement
on
land
he
stood
for
an
instant
stupefied
then
he
swung
down
from
the
tree
as
kazan
leaped
upon
him
over
and
over
they
rolled
to
the
edge
of
the
bank
carried
on
by
the
dog
momentum
in
another
moment
the
thick
heavy
body
of
the
beaver
had
slipped
like
oil
from
under
kazan
and
broken
tooth
was
safe
in
his
element
two
holes
bitten
clean
through
his
fleshy
tail
baffled
in
his
effort
to
get
a
on
broken
tooth
kazan
swung
like
a
flash
to
the
right
the
young
beavers
had
not
moved
astonished
and
frightened
at
what
they
had
seen
they
stood
as
if
stupefied
not
until
they
saw
kazan
tearing
toward
them
did
they
awaken
to
action
three
of
them
reached
the
water
the
fourth
and
fifth
baby
beavers
not
more
than
three
months
old
were
too
late
with
a
single
snap
of
his
jaw
kazan
broke
the
hack
of
one
the
other
he
pinned
down
by
the
throat
and
shook
as
a
terrier
shakes
a
rat
when
gray
wolf
trotted
down
to
him
both
of
the
little
beavers
were
dead
she
sniffed
at
their
soft
little
bodies
and
whined
perhaps
the
baby
creatures
reminded
her
of
runaway
her
own
baby
for
there
was
a
note
of
longing
in
her
whine
as
she
nosed
them
it
was
the
mother
whine
but
if
gray
wolf
had
visions
of
her
own
kazan
understood
nothing
of
them
he
had
killed
two
of
the
creatures
that
had
dared
to
invade
their
home
to
the
little
beavers
he
had
been
as
merciless
as
the
gray
lynx
that
had
murdered
gray
wolf
first
children
on
the
top
of
the
sun
rock
now
that
he
had
sunk
his
teeth
into
the
flesh
of
his
enemies
his
blood
was
filled
with
a
frenzied
desire
to
kill
he
raved
along
the
edge
of
the
pond
snarling
at
the
uneasy
water
under
which
broken
tooth
had
disappeared
all
of
the
beavers
had
taken
refuge
in
the
pond
and
its
surface
was
heaving
with
the
passing
of
many
bodies
beneath
kazan
came
to
the
end
of
the
dam
this
was
new
instinctively
he
knew
that
it
was
the
work
of
broken
tooth
and
his
tribe
and
for
a
few
moments
he
tore
fiercely
at
the
matted
sticks
and
limbs
suddenly
there
was
an
upheaval
of
water
close
to
the
dam
fifty
feet
out
from
the
bank
and
broken
tooth
big
gray
head
appeared
for
a
tense
half
minute
broken
tooth
and
kazan
measured
each
other
at
that
distance
then
broken
tooth
drew
his
wet
shining
body
out
of
the
water
to
the
top
of
the
dam
and
squatted
flat
facing
kazan
the
old
patriarch
was
alone
not
another
beaver
had
shown
himself
the
surface
of
the
pond
had
now
become
quiet
vainly
kazan
tried
to
discover
a
footing
that
would
allow
him
to
reach
the
watchful
invader
but
between
the
solid
wall
of
the
dam
and
the
bank
there
was
a
tangled
framework
through
which
the
water
rushed
with
some
violence
three
times
kazan
fought
to
work
his
way
through
that
tangle
and
three
times
his
efforts
ended
in
sudden
plunges
into
the
water
all
this
time
broken
tooth
did
not
move
when
at
last
kazan
gave
up
the
attack
the
old
engineer
slipped
over
the
edge
of
the
dam
and
disappeared
under
the
water
he
had
learned
that
kazan
like
the
lynx
could
not
fight
water
and
he
spread
the
news
among
the
members
of
his
colony
gray
wolf
and
kazan
returned
to
the
windfall
and
lay
down
in
the
warm
sun
half
an
hour
later
broken
tooth
drew
himself
out
on
the
opposite
shore
of
the
pond
he
was
followed
by
other
beavers
across
the
water
they
resumed
their
work
as
if
nothing
had
happened
the
returned
to
their
trees
half
a
dozen
worked
in
the
water
carrying
loads
of
cement
and
twigs
the
middle
of
the
pond
was
their
across
this
not
one
of
them
passed
a
dozen
times
during
the
hour
that
followed
one
of
the
beavers
swam
up
to
the
and
rested
there
looking
at
the
shining
little
bodies
of
the
babies
that
kazan
had
killed
perhaps
it
was
the
mother
and
perhaps
some
finer
instinct
unknown
to
kazan
told
this
to
gray
wolf
for
gray
wolf
went
down
twice
to
sniff
at
the
dead
bodies
and
each
time
without
seeing
she
went
when
the
mother
beaver
had
come
to
the
the
first
fierce
animus
had
worn
itself
from
kazan
blood
and
he
now
watched
the
beavers
closely
he
had
learned
that
they
were
not
fighters
they
were
many
to
one
and
yet
they
ran
from
him
like
a
lot
of
rabbits
broken
tooth
had
not
even
struck
at
him
and
slowly
it
grew
upon
him
that
these
invading
creatures
that
used
both
the
water
and
land
would
have
to
be
hunted
as
he
stalked
the
rabbit
and
the
partridge
early
in
the
afternoon
he
slipped
off
into
the
bush
followed
by
gray
wolf
he
had
often
begun
the
stalking
of
a
rabbit
by
moving
from
it
and
he
employed
this
wolf
trick
now
with
the
beavers
beyond
the
windfall
he
turned
and
began
trotting
up
the
creek
with
the
wind
for
a
quarter
of
a
mile
the
creek
was
deeper
than
it
had
ever
been
one
of
their
old
fording
places
was
completely
submerged
and
at
last
kazan
plunged
in
and
swam
across
leaving
gray
wolf
to
wait
for
him
on
the
windfall
side
of
the
stream
alone
he
made
his
way
quickly
in
the
direction
of
the
dam
traveling
two
hundred
yards
back
from
the
creek
twenty
yards
below
the
dam
a
dense
thicket
of
alder
and
willow
grew
close
to
the
creek
and
kazan
took
advantage
of
this
he
approached
within
a
leap
or
two
of
the
dam
without
being
seen
and
crouched
close
to
the
ground
ready
to
spring
forth
when
the
opportunity
came
most
of
the
beavers
were
now
working
in
the
water
the
four
or
five
still
on
shore
were
close
to
the
water
and
some
distance
after
a
wait
of
several
minutes
kazan
was
almost
on
the
point
of
staking
everything
on
a
wild
rush
upon
his
enemies
when
a
movement
on
the
dam
attracted
his
attention
out
two
or
three
beavers
were
at
work
strengthening
the
central
structure
with
cement
swift
as
a
flash
kazan
darted
from
his
cover
to
the
shelter
behind
the
dam
here
the
water
was
very
shallow
the
main
portion
of
the
stream
finding
a
passage
close
to
the
opposite
shore
nowhere
did
it
reach
to
his
belly
as
he
waded
out
he
was
completely
hidden
from
the
beavers
and
the
wind
was
in
his
favor
the
noise
of
running
water
drowned
what
little
sound
he
made
soon
he
heard
the
beaver
workmen
over
him
the
branches
of
the
fallen
birch
gave
him
a
footing
and
he
clambered
up
a
moment
later
his
head
and
shoulders
appeared
above
the
top
of
the
dam
scarce
an
arm
length
away
broken
tooth
was
forcing
into
place
a
length
of
poplar
as
big
around
as
a
man
arm
he
was
so
busy
that
he
did
not
hear
or
see
kazan
another
beaver
gave
the
warning
as
he
plunged
into
the
pond
broken
tooth
looked
up
and
his
eyes
met
bared
fangs
there
was
no
time
to
turn
he
threw
himself
back
but
it
was
a
moment
too
late
kazan
was
upon
him
his
long
fangs
sank
deep
into
broken
tooth
neck
but
the
old
beaver
had
thrown
himself
enough
back
to
make
kazan
lose
his
footing
at
the
same
moment
his
teeth
got
a
firm
hold
of
the
loose
skin
at
kazan
throat
thus
clinched
with
kazan
long
teeth
buried
almost
to
the
beaver
jugular
they
plunged
down
into
the
deep
water
of
the
pond
broken
tooth
weighed
sixty
pounds
the
instant
he
struck
the
water
he
was
in
his
element
and
holding
tenaciously
to
the
grip
he
had
obtained
on
kazan
neck
he
sank
like
a
chunk
of
iron
kazan
was
pulled
completely
under
the
water
rushed
into
his
mouth
his
ears
eyes
and
nose
he
was
blinded
and
his
senses
were
a
roaring
tumult
but
instead
of
struggling
to
free
himself
he
held
his
breath
and
buried
his
teeth
deeper
they
touched
the
soft
bottom
and
for
a
moment
floundered
in
the
mud
then
kazan
loosened
his
hold
he
was
fighting
for
his
own
life
now
and
not
for
broken
tooth
with
all
of
the
strength
of
his
powerful
limbs
he
struggled
to
break
loose
to
rise
to
the
surface
to
fresh
air
to
life
he
clamped
his
jaws
shut
knowing
that
to
breathe
was
to
die
on
land
he
could
have
freed
himself
from
broken
tooth
hold
without
an
effort
but
under
water
the
old
beaver
grip
was
more
deadly
than
would
have
been
the
fangs
of
a
lynx
ashore
there
was
a
sudden
swirl
of
water
as
a
second
beaver
circled
close
about
the
struggling
pair
had
he
closed
in
with
broken
tooth
kazan
struggles
would
quickly
have
ceased
but
nature
had
not
foreseen
the
day
when
broken
tooth
would
be
fighting
with
fang
the
old
patriarch
had
no
particular
reason
now
for
holding
kazan
down
he
was
not
vengeful
he
did
not
thirst
for
blood
or
death
finding
that
he
was
free
and
that
this
strange
enemy
that
had
twice
leaped
upon
him
could
do
him
no
harm
he
loosed
his
hold
it
was
not
a
moment
too
soon
for
kazan
he
was
struggling
weakly
when
he
rose
to
the
surface
of
the
water
drowned
he
succeeded
in
raising
his
forepaws
over
a
slender
branch
that
projected
from
the
dam
this
gave
him
time
to
fill
his
lungs
with
air
and
to
cough
forth
the
water
that
had
almost
ended
his
existence
for
ten
minutes
he
clung
to
the
branch
before
he
dared
attempt
the
short
swim
ashore
when
he
reached
the
bank
he
dragged
himself
up
weakly
all
the
strength
was
gone
from
his
body
his
limbs
shook
his
jaws
hung
loose
he
was
beaten
completely
beaten
and
a
creature
without
a
fang
had
worsted
him
he
felt
the
abasement
of
it
drenched
and
slinking
he
went
to
the
windfall
lay
down
in
the
sun
and
waited
for
gray
wolf
days
followed
in
which
kazan
desire
to
destroy
his
beaver
enemies
became
the
consuming
passion
of
his
life
each
day
the
dam
became
more
formidable
cement
work
in
the
water
was
carried
on
by
the
beavers
swiftly
and
safely
the
water
in
the
pond
rose
higher
each
hours
and
the
pond
grew
steadily
wider
the
water
had
now
been
turned
into
the
depression
that
encircled
the
windfall
and
in
another
week
or
two
if
the
beavers
continued
their
work
kazan
and
gray
wolf
home
would
be
nothing
more
than
a
small
island
in
the
center
of
a
wide
area
of
submerged
swamp
kazan
hunted
only
for
food
now
and
not
for
pleasure
ceaselessly
he
watched
his
opportunity
to
leap
upon
incautious
members
of
broken
tooth
tribe
the
third
day
after
the
struggle
under
the
water
he
killed
a
big
beaver
that
approached
too
close
to
the
willow
thicket
the
fifth
day
two
of
the
young
beavers
wandered
into
the
flooded
depression
back
of
the
windfall
and
kazan
caught
them
in
shallow
water
and
tore
them
into
pieces
after
these
successful
assaults
the
beavers
began
to
work
mostly
at
night
this
was
to
kazan
advantage
for
he
was
a
on
each
of
two
consecutive
nights
he
killed
a
beaver
counting
the
young
he
had
killed
seven
when
the
otter
came
never
had
broken
tooth
been
placed
between
two
deadlier
or
more
ferocious
enemies
than
the
two
that
now
assailed
him
on
shore
kazan
was
his
master
because
of
his
swiftness
keener
scent
and
fighting
trickery
in
the
water
the
otter
was
a
still
greater
menace
he
was
swifter
than
the
fish
that
he
caught
for
food
his
teeth
were
like
steel
needles
he
was
so
sleek
and
slippery
that
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
them
to
hold
him
with
their
teeth
could
they
have
caught
him
the
otter
like
the
beaver
possessed
no
hunger
for
blood
yet
in
all
the
northland
he
was
the
greatest
destroyer
of
their
kind
an
even
greater
destroyer
than
man
he
came
and
passed
like
a
plague
and
it
was
in
the
coldest
days
of
winter
that
greatest
destruction
came
with
him
in
those
days
he
did
not
assault
the
beavers
in
their
snug
houses
he
did
what
man
could
do
only
with
dynamite
made
an
embrasure
through
their
dam
swiftly
the
water
would
fall
the
surface
ice
would
crash
down
and
the
beaver
houses
would
be
left
out
of
water
then
followed
death
for
the
beavers
starvation
and
cold
with
the
protecting
water
gone
from
about
their
houses
the
drained
pond
a
chaotic
mass
of
broken
ice
and
the
temperature
forty
or
fifty
degrees
below
zero
they
would
die
within
a
few
hours
for
the
beaver
with
his
thick
coat
of
fur
can
stand
less
cold
than
man
through
all
the
long
winter
the
water
about
his
home
is
as
necessary
to
him
as
fire
to
a
child
but
it
was
summer
now
and
broken
tooth
and
his
colony
had
no
very
great
fear
of
the
otter
it
would
cost
them
some
labor
to
repair
the
damage
he
did
but
there
was
plenty
of
food
and
it
was
warm
for
two
days
the
otter
frisked
about
the
dam
and
the
deep
water
of
the
pond
kazan
took
him
for
a
beaver
and
tried
vainly
to
stalk
him
the
otter
regarded
kazan
suspiciously
and
kept
well
out
of
his
way
neither
knew
that
the
other
was
an
ally
meanwhile
the
beavers
continued
their
work
with
greater
caution
the
water
in
the
pond
had
now
risen
to
a
point
where
the
engineers
had
begun
the
construction
of
three
lodges
on
the
third
day
the
destructive
instinct
of
the
otter
began
its
work
he
began
to
examine
the
dam
close
down
to
the
foundation
it
was
not
long
before
he
found
a
weak
spot
to
begin
work
on
and
with
his
sharp
teeth
and
small
head
he
commenced
his
drilling
operations
inch
by
inch
he
worked
his
way
through
the
dam
burrowing
and
gnawing
over
and
under
the
timbers
and
always
through
the
cement
the
round
hole
he
made
was
fully
seven
inches
in
diameter
in
six
hours
he
had
cut
it
through
the
base
of
the
dam
a
torrent
of
water
began
to
rush
from
the
pond
as
if
forced
out
by
a
hydraulic
pump
kazan
and
gray
wolf
were
hiding
in
the
willows
on
the
south
side
of
the
pond
when
this
happened
they
heard
the
roar
of
the
stream
tearing
through
the
embrasure
and
kazan
saw
the
otter
crawl
up
to
the
top
of
the
dam
and
shake
himself
like
a
huge
within
thirty
minutes
the
water
in
the
pond
had
fallen
perceptibly
and
the
force
of
the
water
pouring
through
the
hole
was
constantly
increasing
the
outlet
in
another
half
hour
the
foundations
of
the
three
lodges
which
had
been
laid
in
about
ten
inches
of
water
stood
on
mud
not
until
broken
tooth
discovered
that
the
water
was
receding
from
the
houses
did
he
take
alarm
he
was
thrown
into
a
panic
and
very
soon
every
beaver
in
the
colony
tearing
excitedly
about
the
pond
they
swam
swiftly
from
shore
to
shore
paying
no
attention
to
the
now
broken
tooth
and
the
older
workmen
made
for
the
dam
and
with
a
snarling
cry
the
otter
plunged
down
among
them
and
out
like
a
flash
for
the
creek
above
the
pond
swiftly
the
water
continued
to
fall
and
as
it
fell
the
excitement
of
the
beavers
increased
they
forgot
kazan
and
gray
wolf
several
of
the
younger
members
of
the
colony
drew
themselves
ashore
on
the
windfall
side
of
the
pond
and
whining
softly
kazan
was
about
to
slip
back
through
the
willows
when
one
of
the
older
beavers
waddled
up
through
the
deepening
mud
close
on
his
ambush
in
two
leaps
kazan
was
upon
him
with
gray
wolf
a
leap
behind
him
the
short
fierce
struggle
in
the
mud
was
seen
by
the
other
beavers
and
they
crossed
swiftly
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
pond
the
water
had
receded
to
a
half
of
its
greatest
width
before
broken
tooth
and
his
workmen
discovered
the
breach
in
the
wall
of
the
dam
the
work
of
repair
was
begun
at
once
for
this
work
sticks
and
brush
of
considerable
size
were
necessary
and
to
reach
this
material
the
beavers
were
compelled
to
drag
their
heavy
bodies
through
the
ten
or
fifteen
yards
of
soft
mud
left
by
the
falling
water
peril
of
fang
no
longer
kept
them
back
instinct
told
them
that
they
were
fighting
for
their
existence
that
if
the
embrasure
were
not
filled
up
and
the
water
kept
in
the
pond
they
would
very
soon
be
completely
exposed
to
their
enemies
it
was
a
day
of
slaughter
for
gray
wolf
and
kazan
they
killed
two
more
beavers
in
the
mud
close
to
the
willows
then
they
crossed
the
creek
below
the
dam
and
cut
off
three
beavers
in
the
depression
behind
the
windfall
there
was
no
escape
for
these
three
they
were
torn
into
pieces
farther
up
the
creek
kazan
caught
a
young
beaver
and
killed
it
late
in
the
afternoon
the
slaughter
ended
broken
tooth
and
his
courageous
engineers
had
at
last
repaired
the
breach
and
the
water
in
the
pond
began
to
rise
half
a
mile
up
the
creek
the
big
otter
was
squatted
on
a
log
basking
in
the
last
glow
of
the
setting
sun
he
would
go
and
do
over
again
his
work
of
destruction
that
was
his
method
for
him
it
was
play
but
that
strange
and
unseen
arbiter
of
the
forests
called
the
spirit
by
those
who
speak
the
wild
tongue
looked
down
at
last
with
mercy
upon
broken
tooth
and
his
tribe
for
in
that
last
glow
of
sunset
kazan
and
gray
wolf
slipped
stealthily
up
the
creek
to
find
the
otter
basking
half
asleep
on
the
log
the
day
work
a
full
stomach
and
the
pool
of
warm
sunlight
in
which
he
lay
had
all
combined
to
make
the
otter
sleepy
he
was
as
motionless
as
the
log
on
which
he
had
stretched
himself
he
was
big
and
gray
and
old
for
ten
years
he
had
lived
to
prove
his
cunning
superior
to
that
of
man
vainly
traps
had
been
set
for
him
wily
trappers
had
built
narrow
of
rock
and
tree
in
small
streams
for
him
but
the
old
otter
had
foiled
their
cunning
and
escaped
the
steel
jaws
waiting
at
the
lower
end
of
each
sluice
the
trail
he
left
in
soft
mud
told
of
his
size
a
few
trappers
had
seen
him
his
soft
pelt
would
long
ago
have
found
its
way
to
london
paris
or
berlin
had
it
not
been
for
his
cunning
he
was
fit
for
a
princess
a
duke
or
an
emperor
for
ten
years
he
had
lived
and
escaped
the
demands
of
the
rich
but
this
was
summer
no
trapper
would
have
killed
him
now
for
his
pelt
was
worthless
nature
and
instinct
both
told
him
this
at
this
season
he
did
not
dread
man
for
there
was
no
man
to
dread
so
he
lay
asleep
on
the
log
oblivious
to
everything
but
the
comfort
of
sleep
and
the
warmth
of
the
sun
searching
still
for
signs
of
the
furry
enemies
who
had
invaded
their
domain
kazan
slipped
along
the
creek
gray
wolf
ran
close
at
his
shoulder
they
made
no
sound
and
the
wind
was
in
their
favor
bringing
scents
toward
them
it
brought
the
otter
smell
to
kazan
and
gray
wolf
it
was
the
scent
of
a
water
animal
rank
and
fishy
and
they
took
it
for
the
beaver
they
advanced
still
more
cautiously
then
kazan
saw
the
big
otter
asleep
on
the
log
and
he
gave
the
warning
to
gray
wolf
she
stopped
standing
with
her
head
thrown
up
while
kazan
made
his
stealthy
advance
the
otter
stirred
uneasily
it
was
growing
dusk
the
golden
pool
of
sunlight
had
faded
away
back
in
the
darkening
timber
an
owl
greeted
night
with
its
call
the
otter
breathed
deeply
his
whiskered
muzzle
twitched
he
was
awakening
stirring
when
kazan
leaped
upon
him
face
to
face
in
fair
fight
the
old
otter
could
have
given
a
good
account
of
himself
but
there
was
no
chance
now
the
wild
itself
had
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
become
his
deadliest
enemy
it
was
not
man
now
but
the
spirit
that
had
laid
its
hand
upon
him
and
from
the
spirit
there
was
no
escape
kazan
fangs
sank
into
his
soft
jugular
perhaps
he
died
without
knowing
what
it
was
that
had
leaped
upon
him
for
he
died
quickly
and
kazan
and
gray
wolf
went
on
their
way
hunting
still
for
enemies
to
slaughter
and
not
knowing
that
in
the
otter
they
had
killed
the
one
ally
who
would
have
driven
the
beavers
from
their
swamp
home
the
days
that
followed
grew
more
and
more
hopeless
for
kazan
and
gray
wolf
with
the
otter
gone
broken
tooth
and
his
tribe
held
the
winning
hand
each
day
the
water
backed
a
little
farther
into
the
depression
surrounding
the
windfall
by
the
middle
of
july
only
a
narrow
strip
of
land
connected
the
windfall
hummock
with
the
dry
land
of
the
swamp
in
deep
water
the
beavers
now
worked
unmolested
inch
by
inch
the
water
rose
until
there
came
the
day
when
it
began
to
overflow
the
connecting
strip
for
the
last
time
kazan
and
gray
wolf
passed
from
their
windfall
home
and
traveled
up
the
stream
between
the
two
ridges
the
creek
held
a
new
meaning
for
them
now
and
as
they
traveled
they
sniffed
its
odors
and
listened
to
its
sounds
with
an
interest
they
had
never
known
before
it
was
an
interest
mingled
a
little
with
fear
for
something
in
the
manner
in
which
the
beavers
had
beaten
them
reminded
kazan
and
gray
wolf
of
and
that
night
when
in
the
radiance
of
the
big
white
moon
they
came
within
scent
of
the
beaver
colony
that
broken
tooth
had
left
they
turned
quickly
northward
into
the
plains
thus
had
brave
old
broken
tooth
taught
them
to
respect
the
flesh
and
blood
and
handiwork
of
his
tribe
chapter
xxi
a
shot
on
the
july
and
august
of
were
months
of
great
fires
in
the
northland
the
swamp
home
of
kazan
and
gray
wolf
and
the
green
valley
between
the
two
ridges
had
escaped
the
seas
of
devastating
flame
but
now
as
they
set
forth
on
their
wandering
adventures
again
it
was
not
long
before
their
padded
feet
came
in
contact
with
the
seared
and
blackened
desolation
that
had
followed
so
closely
after
the
plague
and
starvation
of
the
preceding
winter
in
his
humiliation
and
defeat
after
being
driven
from
his
swamp
home
by
the
beavers
kazan
led
his
blind
mate
first
into
the
south
twenty
miles
beyond
the
ridge
they
struck
the
forests
winds
from
hudson
bay
had
driven
the
flames
in
an
unbroken
sea
into
the
west
and
they
had
left
not
a
vestige
of
life
or
a
patch
of
green
blind
gray
wolf
could
not
see
the
blackened
world
but
she
it
it
recalled
to
her
memory
of
that
other
fire
after
the
battle
on
the
sun
rock
and
all
of
her
wonderful
instincts
sharpened
and
developed
by
her
blindness
told
her
that
to
the
north
and
not
south
lay
the
they
were
seeking
the
strain
of
dog
that
was
in
kazan
still
pulled
him
south
it
was
not
because
he
sought
man
for
to
man
he
had
now
become
as
deadly
an
enemy
as
gray
wolf
herself
it
was
simply
dog
instinct
to
travel
southward
in
the
face
of
fire
it
was
wolf
instinct
to
travel
northward
at
the
end
of
the
third
day
gray
wolf
won
they
recrossed
the
little
valley
between
the
two
ridges
and
swung
north
and
west
into
the
athabasca
country
striking
a
course
that
would
ultimately
bring
them
to
the
headwaters
of
the
mcfarlane
river
late
in
the
preceding
autumn
a
prospector
had
come
up
to
fort
smith
on
the
slave
river
with
a
pickle
bottle
filled
with
gold
dust
and
nuggets
he
had
made
the
find
on
the
mcfarlane
the
first
mails
had
taken
the
news
to
the
outside
world
and
by
midwinter
the
earliest
members
of
a
horde
were
rushing
into
the
country
by
and
other
finds
came
thick
and
fast
the
mcfarlane
was
rich
in
free
gold
and
miners
by
the
score
staked
out
their
claims
along
it
and
began
work
latecomers
swung
to
new
fields
farther
north
and
east
and
to
fort
smith
came
rumors
of
finds
richer
than
those
of
the
yukon
a
score
of
men
at
first
then
a
hundred
five
hundred
a
thousand
rushed
into
the
new
country
most
of
these
were
from
the
prairie
countries
to
the
south
and
from
the
placer
beds
of
the
saskatchewan
and
the
frazer
from
the
far
north
traveling
by
way
of
the
mackenzie
and
the
liard
came
a
smaller
number
of
seasoned
prospectors
and
adventurers
from
the
yukon
men
who
knew
what
it
meant
to
starve
and
freeze
and
die
by
inches
one
of
these
late
comers
was
sandy
mctrigger
there
were
several
reasons
why
sandy
had
left
the
yukon
he
was
in
bad
with
the
police
who
patrolled
the
country
west
of
dawson
and
he
was
broke
in
spite
of
these
facts
he
was
one
of
the
best
prospectors
that
had
ever
followed
the
shores
of
the
klondike
he
had
made
discoveries
running
up
to
a
million
or
two
and
had
promptly
lost
them
through
gambling
and
drink
he
had
no
conscience
and
little
fear
brutality
was
the
chief
thing
written
in
his
face
his
undershot
jaw
his
wide
eyes
low
forehead
and
grizzly
mop
of
red
hair
proclaimed
him
at
once
as
a
man
not
to
be
trusted
beyond
one
own
vision
or
the
reach
of
a
bullet
it
was
suspected
that
he
had
killed
a
couple
of
men
and
robbed
others
but
as
yet
the
police
had
failed
to
get
anything
on
him
but
along
with
this
bad
side
of
him
sandy
mctrigger
possessed
a
coolness
and
a
courage
which
even
his
worst
enemies
could
not
but
admire
and
also
certain
mental
depths
which
his
unpleasant
features
did
not
proclaim
inside
of
six
months
red
gold
city
had
sprung
up
on
the
mcfarlane
a
hundred
and
fifty
miles
from
fort
smith
and
fort
smith
was
five
hundred
miles
from
civilization
when
sandy
came
he
looked
over
the
crude
collection
of
shacks
gambling
houses
and
saloons
in
the
new
town
and
made
up
his
mind
that
the
time
was
not
ripe
for
any
of
his
inside
schemes
just
yet
he
gambled
a
little
and
won
sufficient
to
buy
himself
grub
and
half
an
outfit
a
feature
of
this
outfit
was
an
old
rifle
sandy
who
always
carried
the
latest
savage
on
the
market
laughed
at
it
but
it
was
the
best
his
finances
would
allow
of
he
started
south
up
the
mcfarlane
beyond
a
certain
point
on
the
river
prospectors
had
found
no
gold
sandy
pushed
confidently
this
point
not
until
he
was
in
new
country
did
he
begin
his
search
slowly
he
worked
his
way
up
a
small
tributary
whose
headwaters
were
fifty
or
sixty
miles
to
the
south
and
east
here
and
there
he
found
fairly
good
placer
gold
he
might
have
panned
six
or
eight
worth
a
day
with
this
much
he
was
disgusted
week
after
week
he
continued
to
work
his
way
and
the
farther
he
went
the
poorer
his
pans
became
at
last
only
occasionally
did
he
find
colors
after
such
disgusting
weeks
as
these
sandy
was
dangerous
when
in
the
company
of
others
alone
he
was
harmless
one
afternoon
he
ran
his
canoe
ashore
on
a
white
strip
of
sand
this
was
at
a
bend
where
the
stream
had
widened
and
gave
promise
of
at
least
a
few
colors
he
had
bent
down
close
to
the
edge
of
the
water
when
something
caught
his
attention
on
the
wet
sand
what
he
saw
were
the
footprints
of
animals
two
had
come
down
to
drink
they
had
stood
side
by
side
and
the
footprints
were
fresh
made
not
more
than
an
hour
or
two
before
a
gleam
of
interest
shot
into
sandy
eyes
he
looked
behind
him
and
up
and
down
the
stream
wolves
he
grunted
wish
i
could
shot
at
with
that
old
back
there
gawd
listen
to
that
and
in
broad
daylight
too
he
jumped
to
his
feet
staring
off
into
the
bush
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
gray
wolf
had
caught
the
dreaded
scent
of
man
in
the
wind
and
was
giving
voice
to
her
warning
it
was
a
long
wailing
howl
and
not
until
its
last
echoes
had
died
away
did
sandy
mctrigger
move
then
he
returned
to
the
canoe
took
out
his
old
gun
put
a
fresh
cap
on
the
nipple
and
disappeared
quickly
over
the
edge
of
the
bank
for
a
week
kazan
and
gray
wolf
had
been
wandering
about
the
headwaters
of
the
mcfarlane
and
this
was
the
first
time
since
the
preceding
winter
that
gray
wolf
had
caught
the
scent
of
man
in
the
air
when
the
wind
brought
the
to
her
she
was
alone
two
or
three
minutes
before
the
scent
came
to
her
kazan
had
left
her
side
in
swift
pursuit
of
a
rabbit
and
she
lay
flat
on
her
belly
under
a
bush
waiting
for
him
in
these
moments
when
she
was
alone
gray
wolf
was
constantly
sniffing
the
air
blindness
had
developed
her
scent
and
hearing
until
they
were
next
to
infallible
first
she
had
heard
the
rattle
of
sandy
mctrigger
paddle
against
the
side
of
his
canoe
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
scent
had
followed
swiftly
five
minutes
after
her
warning
howl
kazan
stood
at
her
side
his
head
flung
up
his
jaws
open
and
panting
sandy
had
hunted
arctic
foxes
and
he
was
using
the
eskimo
tactics
now
swinging
in
a
until
he
should
come
up
in
the
face
of
the
wind
kazan
caught
a
single
whiff
of
the
air
and
his
spine
grew
stiff
but
blind
gray
wolf
was
keener
than
the
little
fox
of
the
north
her
pointed
nose
slowly
followed
sandy
progress
she
heard
a
dry
stick
crack
under
his
feet
three
hundred
yards
away
she
caught
the
metallic
click
of
his
as
it
struck
a
birch
sapling
the
moment
she
lost
sandy
in
the
wind
she
whined
and
rubbed
herself
against
kazan
and
trotted
a
few
steps
to
the
southwest
at
times
such
as
this
kazan
seldom
refused
to
take
guidance
from
her
they
trotted
away
side
by
side
and
by
the
time
sandy
was
creeping
up
with
the
wind
in
his
face
kazan
was
peering
from
the
fringe
of
river
brush
down
upon
the
canoe
on
the
white
strip
of
sand
when
sandy
returned
after
an
hour
of
futile
stalking
two
fresh
tracks
led
straight
down
to
the
canoe
he
looked
at
them
in
amazement
and
then
a
sinister
grin
wrinkled
his
ugly
face
he
chuckled
as
he
went
to
his
kit
and
dug
out
a
small
rubber
bag
from
this
he
drew
a
tightly
corked
bottle
filled
with
gelatine
capsules
in
each
little
capsule
were
five
grains
of
strychnine
there
were
dark
hints
that
once
upon
a
time
sandy
mctrigger
had
tried
one
of
these
capsules
by
dropping
it
in
a
cup
of
coffee
and
giving
it
to
a
man
but
the
police
had
never
proved
it
he
was
expert
in
the
use
of
poison
probably
he
had
killed
a
thousand
foxes
in
his
time
and
he
chuckled
again
as
he
counted
out
a
dozen
of
the
capsules
and
thought
how
easy
it
would
be
to
get
this
inquisitive
pair
of
wolves
two
or
three
days
before
he
had
killed
a
caribou
and
each
of
the
capsules
he
now
rolled
up
in
a
little
ball
of
deer
fat
doing
the
work
with
short
sticks
in
place
of
his
fingers
so
that
there
would
be
no
clinging
to
the
before
sundown
sandy
set
out
at
over
the
plain
planting
the
baits
most
of
them
he
hung
to
low
bushes
others
he
dropped
in
worn
rabbit
and
caribou
trails
then
he
returned
to
the
creek
and
cooked
his
supper
then
next
morning
he
was
up
early
and
off
to
the
poison
baits
the
first
bait
was
untouched
the
second
was
as
he
had
planted
it
the
third
was
gone
a
thrill
shot
through
sandy
as
he
looked
about
him
somewhere
within
a
radius
of
two
or
three
hundred
yards
he
would
find
his
game
then
his
glance
fell
to
the
ground
under
the
bush
where
he
had
hung
the
poison
capsule
and
an
oath
broke
from
his
lips
the
bait
had
not
been
eaten
the
caribou
fat
lay
scattered
under
the
bush
and
still
imbedded
in
the
largest
portion
of
it
was
the
little
white
capsule
unbroken
it
was
sandy
first
experience
with
a
wild
creature
whose
instincts
were
sharpened
by
blindness
and
he
was
puzzled
he
had
never
known
this
to
happen
before
if
a
fox
or
a
wolf
could
be
lured
to
the
point
of
touching
a
bait
it
followed
that
the
bait
was
eaten
sandy
went
on
to
the
fourth
and
the
fifth
baits
they
were
untouched
the
sixth
was
torn
to
pieces
like
the
third
in
this
instance
the
capsule
was
broken
and
the
white
powder
scattered
two
more
poison
baits
sandy
found
pulled
down
in
this
manner
he
knew
that
kazan
and
gray
wolf
had
done
the
work
for
he
found
the
marks
of
their
feet
in
a
dozen
different
places
the
accumulated
bad
humor
of
weeks
of
futile
labor
found
vent
in
his
disappointment
and
anger
at
last
he
had
found
something
tangible
to
curse
the
failure
of
his
poison
baits
he
accepted
as
a
sort
of
climax
to
his
general
bad
luck
everything
was
against
him
he
believed
and
he
made
up
his
mind
to
return
to
red
gold
city
early
in
the
afternoon
he
launched
his
canoe
and
drifted
with
the
current
he
was
content
to
let
the
current
do
all
of
the
work
and
he
used
his
paddle
just
enough
to
keep
his
slender
craft
head
on
he
leaned
back
comfortably
and
smoked
his
pipe
with
the
old
rifle
between
his
knees
the
wind
was
in
his
face
and
he
kept
a
sharp
watch
for
game
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
when
kazan
and
gray
wolf
came
out
on
a
five
or
six
miles
kazan
was
lapping
up
the
cool
water
when
sandy
drifted
quietly
around
a
bend
a
hundred
yards
above
them
if
the
wind
had
been
right
or
if
sandy
had
been
using
his
paddle
gray
wolf
would
have
detected
danger
it
was
the
metallic
of
the
lock
of
sandy
rifle
that
awakened
her
to
a
sense
of
peril
instantly
she
was
thrilled
by
the
nearness
of
it
kazan
heard
the
sound
and
stopped
drinking
to
face
it
in
that
moment
sandy
pressed
the
trigger
a
belch
of
smoke
a
roar
of
gunpowder
and
kazan
felt
a
stream
of
fire
pass
with
the
swiftness
of
a
through
his
brain
he
stumbled
back
his
legs
gave
way
under
him
and
he
crumpled
down
in
a
limp
heap
gray
wolf
darted
like
a
streak
off
into
the
bush
blind
she
had
not
seen
kazan
wilt
down
upon
the
white
sand
not
until
she
was
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
from
the
terrifying
thunder
of
the
white
man
rifle
did
she
stop
and
wait
for
him
sandy
mctrigger
grounded
his
canoe
on
the
with
an
exultant
yell
got
you
you
old
devil
did
i
he
cried
i
got
the
other
too
if
i
had
something
besides
this
damned
old
relic
he
turned
kazan
head
over
with
the
butt
of
his
gun
and
the
leer
of
satisfaction
in
his
face
gave
place
to
a
sudden
look
of
amazement
for
the
first
time
he
saw
the
collar
about
kazan
neck
my
gawd
it
ai
a
wolf
he
gasped
it
a
dog
sandy
mctrigger

chapter
xxii
sandy
method
mctrigger
dropped
on
his
knees
in
the
sand
the
look
of
exultation
was
gone
from
his
face
he
twisted
the
collar
about
the
dog
limp
neck
until
he
came
to
the
worn
plate
on
which
he
could
make
out
the
faintly
engraved
letters
he
spelled
the
letters
out
one
by
one
and
the
look
in
his
face
was
of
one
who
still
disbelieved
what
he
had
seen
and
heard
a
dog
he
exclaimed
again
a
dog
sandy
mctrigger
an
a
a
beauty
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
looked
down
on
his
victim
a
pool
of
blood
lay
in
the
white
sand
at
the
end
of
kazan
nose
after
a
moment
sandy
bent
over
to
see
where
his
bullet
had
struck
his
inspection
filled
him
with
a
new
and
greater
interest
the
heavy
ball
from
the
had
struck
kazan
fairly
on
top
of
the
head
it
was
a
glancing
blow
that
had
not
even
broken
the
skull
and
like
a
flash
sandy
understood
the
quivering
and
twitching
of
kazan
shoulders
and
legs
he
had
thought
that
they
were
the
last
muscular
throes
of
death
but
kazan
was
not
dying
he
was
only
stunned
and
would
be
on
his
feet
again
in
a
few
minutes
sandy
was
a
connoisseur
of
dogs
of
dogs
that
had
worn
sledge
traces
he
had
lived
among
them
of
his
life
he
could
tell
their
age
their
value
and
a
part
of
their
history
at
a
glance
in
the
snow
he
could
tell
the
trail
of
a
mackenzie
hound
from
that
of
a
malemute
and
the
track
of
an
eskimo
dog
from
that
of
a
yukon
husky
he
looked
at
kazan
feet
they
were
wolf
feet
and
he
chuckled
kazan
was
part
wild
he
was
big
and
powerful
and
sandy
thought
of
the
coming
winter
and
of
the
high
prices
that
dogs
would
bring
at
red
gold
city
he
went
to
the
canoe
and
returned
with
a
roll
of
stout
babiche
then
he
sat
down
in
front
of
kazan
and
began
making
a
muzzle
he
did
this
by
plaiting
babiche
thongs
in
the
same
manner
that
one
does
in
making
the
web
of
a
in
ten
minutes
he
had
the
muzzle
over
kazan
nose
and
fastened
securely
about
his
neck
to
the
dog
collar
he
then
fastened
a
rope
of
babiche
after
that
he
sat
back
and
waited
for
kazan
to
come
to
life
when
kazan
first
lifted
his
head
he
could
not
see
there
was
a
red
film
before
his
eyes
but
this
passed
away
swiftly
and
he
saw
the
man
his
first
instinct
was
to
rise
to
his
feet
three
times
he
fell
back
before
he
could
stand
up
sandy
was
squatted
six
feet
from
him
holding
the
end
of
the
babiche
and
grinning
kazan
fangs
gleamed
back
he
growled
and
the
crest
along
his
spine
rose
menacingly
sandy
jumped
to
his
feet
guess
i
know
what
you
figgering
on
he
said
i
had
kind
before
the
dam
wolves
have
turned
you
bad
an
you
need
a
whole
lot
of
club
before
you
right
again
now
look
here
sandy
had
taken
the
precaution
of
bringing
a
thick
club
along
with
the
babiche
he
picked
it
up
from
where
he
had
dropped
it
in
the
sand
kazan
strength
had
fairly
returned
to
him
now
he
was
no
longer
dizzy
the
mist
had
cleared
away
from
his
eyes
before
him
he
saw
once
more
his
old
enemy
man
man
and
the
club
all
of
the
wild
ferocity
of
his
nature
was
roused
in
an
instant
without
reasoning
he
knew
that
gray
wolf
was
gone
and
that
this
man
was
accountable
for
her
going
he
knew
that
this
man
had
also
brought
him
his
own
hurt
and
what
he
ascribed
to
the
man
he
also
attributed
to
the
club
in
his
newer
undertaking
of
things
born
of
freedom
and
gray
wolf
man
and
club
were
one
and
inseparable
with
a
snarl
he
leaped
at
sandy
the
man
was
not
expecting
a
direct
assault
and
before
he
could
raise
his
club
or
spring
aside
kazan
had
landed
full
on
his
chest
the
muzzle
about
kazan
jaws
saved
him
fangs
that
would
have
torn
his
throat
open
snapped
harmlessly
under
the
weight
of
the
dog
body
he
fell
back
as
if
struck
down
by
a
catapult
as
quick
as
a
cat
he
was
on
his
feet
again
with
the
end
of
the
babiche
twisted
several
times
about
his
hand
kazan
leaped
again
and
this
time
he
was
met
by
a
furious
swing
of
the
club
it
smashed
against
his
shoulder
and
sent
him
down
in
the
sand
before
he
could
recover
sandy
was
upon
him
with
all
the
fury
of
a
man
gone
mad
he
shortened
the
babiche
by
twisting
it
again
and
again
about
his
hand
and
the
club
rose
and
fell
with
the
skill
and
strength
of
one
long
accustomed
to
its
use
the
first
blows
served
only
to
add
to
kazan
hatred
of
man
and
the
ferocity
and
fearlessness
of
his
attacks
again
and
again
he
leaped
in
and
each
time
the
club
fell
upon
him
with
a
force
that
threatened
to
break
his
bones
there
was
a
tense
hard
look
about
sandy
cruel
mouth
he
had
never
known
a
dog
like
this
before
and
he
was
a
bit
nervous
even
with
kazan
muzzled
three
times
kazan
fangs
would
have
sunk
deep
in
his
flesh
had
it
not
been
for
the
babiche
and
if
the
thongs
about
his
jaws
should
slip
or
break
sandy
followed
up
the
thought
with
a
smashing
blow
that
landed
on
kazan
head
and
once
more
the
old
battler
fell
limp
upon
the
sand
mctrigger
breath
was
coming
in
quick
gasps
he
was
almost
winded
not
until
the
club
slipped
from
his
hand
did
he
realize
how
desperate
the
fight
had
been
before
kazan
recovered
from
the
blow
that
had
stunned
him
sandy
examined
the
muzzle
and
strengthened
it
by
adding
another
babiche
thong
then
he
dragged
kazan
to
a
log
that
high
water
had
thrown
up
on
the
shore
a
few
yards
away
and
made
the
end
of
the
babiche
rope
fast
to
a
dead
snag
after
that
he
pulled
his
canoe
higher
up
on
the
sand
and
began
to
prepare
camp
for
the
night
for
some
minutes
after
kazan
stunned
senses
had
become
normal
he
lay
motionless
watching
sandy
mctrigger
every
bone
in
his
body
gave
him
pain
his
jaws
were
sore
and
bleeding
his
upper
lip
was
smashed
where
the
club
had
fallen
one
eye
was
almost
closed
several
times
sandy
came
near
much
pleased
at
what
he
regarded
as
the
good
results
of
the
beating
each
time
he
brought
the
club
the
third
time
he
prodded
kazan
with
it
and
the
dog
snarled
and
snapped
savagely
at
the
end
of
it
that
was
what
sandy
wanted
it
was
an
old
trick
of
the
instantly
he
was
using
the
club
again
until
with
a
whining
cry
kazan
slunk
under
the
protection
of
the
snag
to
which
he
was
fastened
he
could
scarcely
drag
himself
his
right
forepaw
was
smashed
his
hindquarters
sank
under
him
for
a
time
after
this
second
beating
he
could
not
have
escaped
had
he
been
free
sandy
was
in
unusually
good
humor
i
take
the
devil
out
of
you
all
right
he
told
kazan
for
the
twentieth
time
there
nothin
like
beatin
to
make
dogs
an
wimmin

to
the
mark

month
from

worth

hundred
dollars
or
i
skin
you
alive
three
or
four
times
before
dusk
sandy
worked
to
rouse
kazan
animosity
but
there
was
no
longer
any
desire
left
in
kazan
to
fight
his
two
terrific
beatings
and
the
crushing
blow
of
the
bullet
against
his
skull
had
made
him
sick
he
lay
with
his
head
between
his
forepaws
his
eyes
closed
and
did
not
see
mctrigger
he
paid
no
attention
to
the
meat
that
was
thrown
under
his
nose
he
did
not
know
when
the
last
of
the
sun
sank
behind
the
western
forests
or
when
the
darkness
came
but
at
last
something
roused
him
from
his
stupor
to
his
dazed
and
sickened
brain
it
came
like
a
call
from
out
of
the
far
past
and
he
raised
his
head
and
listened
out
on
the
sand
mctrigger
had
built
a
fire
and
the
man
stood
in
the
red
glow
of
it
now
facing
the
dark
shadows
beyond
the
shoreline
he
too
was
listening
what
had
roused
kazan
came
again
now
the
lost
mourning
cry
of
gray
wolf
far
out
on
the
plain
with
a
whine
kazan
was
on
his
feet
tugging
at
the
babiche
sandy
snatched
up
his
club
and
leaped
toward
him
down
you
brute
he
commanded
in
the
firelight
the
club
rose
and
fell
with
ferocious
quickness
when
mctrigger
returned
to
the
fire
he
was
breathing
hard
again
he
tossed
his
club
beside
the
blankets
he
had
spread
out
for
a
bed
it
was
a
different
looking
club
now
it
was
covered
with
blood
and
hair
guess
that
take
the
spirit
out
of
him
he
chuckled
it
do
that
or
kill
several
times
that
night
kazan
heard
gray
wolf
call
he
whined
softly
in
response
fearing
the
club
he
watched
the
fire
until
the
last
embers
of
it
died
out
and
then
cautiously
dragged
himself
from
under
the
snag
two
or
three
times
he
tried
to
stand
on
his
feet
but
fell
back
each
time
his
legs
were
not
broken
but
the
pain
of
standing
on
them
was
excruciating
he
was
hot
and
feverish
all
that
night
he
had
craved
a
drink
of
water
when
sandy
crawled
out
from
between
his
blankets
in
the
early
dawn
he
gave
him
both
meat
and
water
kazan
drank
the
water
but
would
not
touch
the
meat
sandy
regarded
the
change
in
him
with
satisfaction
by
the
time
the
sun
was
up
he
had
finished
his
breakfast
and
was
ready
to
leave
he
approached
kazan
fearlessly
now
without
the
club
untying
the
babiche
he
dragged
the
dog
to
the
canoe
kazan
slunk
in
the
sand
while
his
captor
fastened
the
end
of
the
hide
rope
to
the
stern
of
the
canoe
sandy
grinned
what
was
about
to
happen
would
be
fun
for
him
in
the
yukon
he
had
learned
how
to
take
the
spirit
out
of
dogs
he
pushed
off
bow
foremost
bracing
himself
with
his
paddle
he
then
began
to
pull
kazan
toward
the
water
in
a
few
moments
kazan
stood
with
his
forefeet
planted
in
the
damp
sand
at
the
edge
of
the
stream
for
a
brief
interval
sandy
allowed
the
babiche
to
fall
slack
then
with
a
sudden
powerful
pull
he
jerked
kazan
out
into
the
water
instantly
he
sent
the
canoe
into
midstream
swung
it
quickly
down
with
the
current
and
began
to
paddle
enough
to
keep
the
babiche
taut
about
his
neck
in
spite
of
his
sickness
and
injuries
kazan
was
now
compelled
to
swim
to
keep
his
head
above
water
in
the
wash
of
the
canoe
and
with
sandy
strokes
growing
steadily
stronger
his
position
became
each
moment
one
of
increasing
torture
at
times
his
shaggy
head
was
pulled
completely
under
water
at
others
sandy
would
wait
until
he
had
drifted
alongside
and
then
thrust
him
under
with
the
end
of
his
paddle
he
grew
weaker
at
the
end
of
a
he
was
drowning
not
until
then
did
sandy
pull
him
alongside
and
drag
him
into
the
canoe
the
dog
fell
limp
and
gasping
in
the
bottom
brutal
though
sandy
methods
had
been
they
had
worked
his
purpose
in
kazan
there
was
no
longer
a
desire
to
fight
he
no
longer
struggled
for
freedom
he
knew
that
this
man
was
his
master
and
for
the
time
his
spirit
was
gone
all
he
desired
now
was
to
be
allowed
to
lie
in
the
bottom
of
the
canoe
out
of
reach
of
the
club
and
safe
from
the
water
the
club
lay
between
him
and
the
man
the
end
of
it
was
within
a
foot
or
two
of
his
nose
and
what
he
smelled
was
his
own
blood
for
five
days
and
five
nights
the
journey
continued
and
mctrigger
process
of
civilizing
kazan
was
continued
in
three
more
beatings
with
the
club
and
another
resort
to
the
water
torture
on
the
morning
of
the
sixth
day
they
reached
red
gold
city
and
mctrigger
put
up
his
tent
close
to
the
river
somewhere
he
obtained
a
chain
for
kazan
and
after
fastening
the
dog
securely
back
of
the
tent
he
cut
off
the
babiche
muzzle
you
ca
put
on
meat
in
a
muzzle
he
told
his
prisoner
an

want
you

card
twice
a
day
after
this
he
brought
fresh
raw
meat
to
kazan
quickly
kazan
spirit
and
courage
returned
to
him
the
soreness
left
his
limbs
his
battered
jaws
healed
and
after
the
fourth
day
each
time
that
sandy
came
with
meat
he
greeted
him
with
the
challenge
of
his
snarling
fangs
mctrigger
did
not
beat
him
now
he
gave
him
no
fish
no
tallow
and
meal
nothing
but
raw
meat
he
traveled
five
miles
up
the
river
to
bring
in
the
fresh
entrail
of
a
caribou
that
had
been
killed
one
day
sandy
brought
another
man
with
him
and
when
the
stranger
came
a
step
too
near
kazan
made
a
sudden
swift
lunge
at
him
the
man
jumped
back
with
a
startled
oath
he
do
he
growled
he
lighter
by
ten
or
fifteen
pounds
than
the
dane
but
he
got
the
teeth
an
the
quickness
an
he
give
a
good
show
before
he
goes
under
i
make
you
a
bet
of
per
cent

my
share
that
he

how
long
before

he
added

share
that

sandy

a
long
look
at

he
said
then
as
he
shook

a

between

and
the

red

was
ripe
for
a
night
of
relaxation
there
had
been
some
gambling
a
few
fights
and
enough
liquor
to
create
excitement
now
and
then
but
the
presence
of
the
mounted
police
had
served
to
keep
things
unusually
tame
compared
with

a

hundred
miles
farther
north
in

the
entertainment
proposed
by

met
with

the

spread
for
twenty
miles
about

and
there
had
never
been
greater
excitement
in
the
town
than
on
the
afternoon
and
night
of
the
big
fight
this
was
largely
because
kazan
and
the
huge
dane
had
been
placed
on
exhibition
each
dog
in
a
specially
made
cage
of
his
own
and
a
fever
of
betting
began
three
hundred
men
each
of
whom
was
paying
five

to
see
the

by
the
odds

occasionally
it
ran
three

at
these
odds
there
was
plenty
of

those
who
were
risking
their

on

were
the

men
who

among

thrust
themselves
between
them
at

kazan
had
snarled
at
all
these
faces
about
him
but
now
he
lay
back
against
the
boarded
side
of
the
cage
and
eyed
them
sullenly
from
between
his
forepaws
the
fight
was
to
be
pulled
off
in
barker
place
a
combination
of
saloon
and
cafe
the
benches
and
tables
had
been
cleared
out
and
in
the
center
of
the
one
big
room
a
cage
ten
feet
square
rested
on
a
platform
three
and
a
half
feet
from
the
floor
seats
for
the
three
hundred
spectators
were
drawn
closely
around
this
suspended
just
above
the
open
top
of
the
cage
were
two
big
oil
lamps
with
glass
reflectors
it
was
eight
when
harker
mctrigger
and
two
other
men
bore
kazan
to
the
arena
by
means
of
the
wooden
bars
that
projected
from
the
bottom
of
his
cage
the
big
dane
was
already
in
the
fighting
cage
he
stood
blinking
his
eyes
in
the
brilliant
light
of
the
reflecting
lamps
he
pricked
up
his
ears
when
he
saw
kazan
kazan
did
not
show
his
fangs
neither
revealed
the
expected
animosity
it
was
the
first
they
had
seen
of
each
other
and
a
murmur
of
disappointment
swept
the
ranks
of
the
three
hundred
men
the
dane
remained
as
motionless
as
a
rock
when
kazan
was
prodded
from
his
own
cage
into
the
fighting
cage
he
did
not
leap
or
snarl
he
regarded
kazan
with
a
dubious
questioning
poise
to
his
splendid
head
and
then
looked
again
to
the
expectant
and
excited
faces
of
the
waiting
men
for
a
few
moments
kazan
stood
facing
the
dane
then
his
shoulders
dropped
and
he
too
coolly
faced
the
crowd
that
had
expected
a
fight
to
the
death
a
laugh
of
derision
swept
through
the
closely
seated
rows
catcalls
jeering
taunts
flung
at
mctrigger
and
harker
and
angry
voices
demanding
their
money
back
mingled
with
a
tumult
of
growing
discontent
sandy
face
was
red
with
mortification
and
rage
the
blue
veins
in
barker
forehead
had
swollen
twice
their
normal
size
he
shook
his
fist
in
the
face
of
the
crowd
and
shouted
wait
give
a
chance
you
dam
fools
at
his
words
every
voice
was
stilled
kazan
had
turned
he
was
facing
the
huge
dane
and
the
dane
had
turned
his
eyes
to
kazan
cautiously
prepared
for
a
lunge
or
a
sidestep
kazan
advanced
a
little
the
shoulders
bristled
he
too
advanced
upon
kazan
four
feet
apart
they
stood
rigid
one
could
have
heard
a
whisper
in
the
room

sandy

harker
standing
close
to
the
cage
scarcely
breathed

every
limb
and

warriors
of
a
hundred

and
fearless
to
the
point
of
death
the
two
victims
of
man
stood
facing
each
other
none
could
see
the
questioning
look
in
their
brute
eyes
none
knew
that
in
this
thrilling
moment
the
unseen
hand
of
the
wonderful
spirit
god
of
the
wilderness
hovered
between
them
and
that
one
of
its
miracles
was
descending
upon
them
it
was
meeting
in
the
open
rivals
in
the
traces
they
would
have
been
rolling
in
the
throes
of
terrific
battle
but
came
that
mute
appeal
of
brotherhood
in
the
final
moment
when
only
a
step
separated
them
and
when
men
expected
to
see
the
first
mad
lunge
the
splendid
dane
slowly
raised
his
head
and
looked
over
kazan
back
through
the
glare
of
the
lights
harker
trembled
and
under
his
breath
he
cursed
the
dane
throat
was
open
to
kazan
but
between
the
beasts
had
passed
the
voiceless
pledge
of
peace
kazan
did
not
leap
he
turned
and
shoulder
to
shoulder
splendid
in
their
contempt
of
man
they
stood
and
looked
through
the
bars
of
their
prison
into
the
one
of
human
faces
a
roar
burst
from
the
crowd
a
roar
of
anger
of
demand
of
threat
in
his
rage
harker
drew
a
revolver
and
leveled
it
at
the
dane
above
the
tumult
of
the
crowd
a
single
voice
stopped
him
hold
it
demanded
hold
in
the
name
of
the
law
for
a
moment
there
was
silence
every
face
turned
in
the
direction
of
the
voice
two
men
stood
on
chairs
behind
the

row

was

it
was
he
who
had
spoken
he
was
holding
up
a
hand
commanding
silence
and
attention
on
the
chair
beside
him
stood
another
man
he
was
thin
with
drooping
shoulders
and
a
pale
smooth
face
a
little
man
whose
physique
and
hollow
cheeks
told
nothing
of
the
years
he
had
spent
close
up
along
the
raw
edge
of
the
arctic
it
was
he
who
spoke
now
while
the
sergeant
held
up
his
hand
his
voice
was
low
and
quiet
i
give
the
owners
five
hundred
dollars
for
those
dogs
he
said
every
man
in
the
room
heard
the
offer
harker
looked
at
sandy
for
an
instant
their
heads
were
close
together
they
wo
fight
and
they
make
good
the
little
man
went
on
i

the
owners

raised
a
hand
make
it
six
he
said
make
it
six
and
they
yours
the
little
man
hesitated
then
he
nodded
i
give
you
six
hundred
he
agreed
murmurs
of
discontent
rose
throughout
the
crowd
harker
climbed
to
the
edge
of
the
platform
we
ai
to
blame
because
they
would
fight
he
shouted
but
if
there
any
of
you
small
enough
to
want
your
money
back
you
can
git
it
as
you
go
out
the
dogs
laid
down
on
us
that
all
we
ai
to
blame
the
little
man
was
edging
his
way
between
the
chairs
accompanied
by
the
sergeant
of
police
with
his
pale
face
close
to
the
sapling
bars
of
the
cage
he
looked
at
kazan
and
the
big
dane
i
guess
we
be
good
friends
he
said
and
he
spoke
so
low
that
only
the
dogs
heard
his
voice
it
a
big
price
but
we
charge
it
to

kazan
and
the

drew
nearer
to
the
little
scientist
side
of
the

he
pulled
out
a

of
bills

counted
out

day
and
night
were
alike
an
endless
chaos
of
darkness
to
her
now
but
she
knew
when
the
sun
went
down
she
sensed
the
first
deepening
shadows
of
evening
and
she
knew
that
the
stars
were
out
and
that
the
river
lay
in
moonlight
it
was
a
night
to
roam
and
after
a
time
she
moved
restlessly
about
in
a
small
circle
on
the
plain
and
sent
out
her
first
inquiring
call
for
kazan
up
from
the
river
came
the
pungent
odor
of
smoke
and
instinctively
she
knew
that
it
was
this
smoke
and
the
nearness
of
man
that
was
keeping
kazan
from
her
but
she
went
no
nearer
than
that
first
circle
made
by
her
padded
feet
blindness
had
taught
her
to
wait
since
the
day
of
the
battle
on
the
sun
rock
when
the
lynx
had
destroyed
her
eyes
kazan
had
never
failed
her
three
times
she
called
for
him
in
the
early
night
then
she
made
herself
a
nest
under
a
shrub
and
waited
until
dawn
just
how
she
knew
when
night
blotted
out
the
last
glow
of
the
sun
so
without
seeing
she
knew
when
day
came
not
until
she
felt
the
warmth
of
the
sun
on
her
back
did
her
anxiety
overcome
her
caution
slowly
she
moved
toward
the
river
sniffing
the
air
and
whining
there
was
no
longer
the
smell
of
smoke
in
the
air
and
she
could
not
catch
the
scent
of
man
she
followed
her
own
trail
back
to
the
and
in
the
fringe
of
thick
bush
overhanging
the
white
shore
of
the
stream
she
stopped
and
listened
after
a
little
she
scrambled
down
and
went
straight
to
the
spot
where
she
and
kazan
were
drinking
when
the
shot
came
and
there
her
nose
struck
the
sand
still
wet
and
thick
with
kazan
blood
she
knew
it
was
the
blood
of
her
mate
for
the
scent
of
him
was
all
about
her
in
the
sand
mingled
with
the
of
sandy
mctrigger
she
sniffed
the
trail
of
his
body
to
the
edge
of
the
stream
where
sandy
had
dragged
him
to
the
canoe
she
found
the
fallen
tree
to
which
he
had
been
tied
and
then
she
came
upon
one
of
the
two
clubs
that
sandy
had
used
to
beat
wounded
kazan
into
submissiveness
it
was
covered
with
blood
and
hair
and
all
at
once
gray
wolf
lay
back
on
her
haunches
and
turned
her
blind
face
to
the
sky
and
there
rose
from
her
throat
a
cry
for
kazan
that
drifted
for
miles
on
the
wings
of
the
south
wind
never
had
gray
wolf
given
quite
that
cry
before
it
was
not
the
call
that
comes
with
the
moonlit
nights
and
neither
was
it
the
nor
the
yearning
for
matehood
it
carried
with
it
the
lament
of
death
and
after
that
one
cry
gray
wolf
slunk
back
to
the
fringe
of
bush
over
the
river
and
lay
with
her
face
turned
to
the
stream
a
strange
terror
fell
upon
her
she
had
grown
accustomed
to
darkness
but
never
before
had
she
been
in
that
darkness
always
there
had
been
the
guardianship
of
kazan
presence
she
heard
the
clucking
sound
of
a
spruce
hen
in
the
bush
a
few
yards
away
and
now
that
sound
came
to
her
as
if
from
out
of
another
world
a
rustled
through
the
grass
close
to
her
forepaws
and
she
snapped
at
it
and
closed
her
teeth
on
a
rock
the
muscles
of
her
shoulders
twitched
tremulously
and
she
shivered
as
if
stricken
by
intense
cold
she
was
terrified
by
the
darkness
that
shut
out
the
world
from
her
and
she
pawed
at
her
closed
eyes
as
if
she
might
open
them
to
light
early
in
the
afternoon
she
wandered
back
on
the
plain
it
was
different
it
frightened
her
and
soon
she
returned
to
the
beach
and
snuggled
down
under
the
tree
where
kazan
had
lain
she
was
not
so
frightened
here
the
smell
of
kazan
was
strong
about
her
for
an
hour
she
lay
motionless
with
her
head
resting
on
the
club
clotted
with
his
hair
and
blood
night
found
her
still
there
and
when
the
moon
and
the
stars
came
out
she
crawled
back
into
the
pit
in
the
white
sand
that
kazan
body
had
made
under
the
tree
with
dawn
she
went
down
to
the
edge
of
the
stream
to
drink
she
could
not
see
that
the
day
was
almost
as
dark
as
night
and
that
the
sky
was
a
chaos
of
slumbering
storm
but
she
could
smell
the
presence
of
it
in
the
thick
air
and
could
the
forked
flashes
of
lightning
that
rolled
up
with
the
dense
pall
from
the
south
and
west
the
distant
rumbling
of
thunder
grew
louder
and
she
huddled
herself
again
under
the
tree
for
hours
the
storm
crashed
over
her
and
the
rain
fell
in
a
deluge
when
it
had
finished
she
slunk
out
from
her
shelter
like
a
thing
beaten
vainly
she
sought
for
one
last
scent
of
kazan
the
club
was
washed
clean
again
the
sand
was
white
where
kazan
blood
had
reddened
it
even
under
the
tree
there
was
no
sign
of
him
left
until
now
only
the
terror
of
being
alone
in
the
pit
of
darkness
that
enveloped
her
had
oppressed
gray
wolf
with
afternoon
came
hunger
it
was
this
hunger
that
drew
her
from
the
and
she
wandered
back
into
the
plain
a
dozen
times
she
scented
game
and
each
time
it
evaded
her
even
a
that
she
cornered
under
a
root
and
dug
out
with
her
paws
escaped
her
fangs
hours
before
this
kazan
and
gray
wolf
had
left
a
half
of
their
last
kill
a
mile
of
two
farther
back
on
the
plain
the
kill
was
one
of
the
big
barren
rabbits
and
gray
wolf
turned
in
its
direction
she
did
not
require
sight
to
find
it
in
her
was
developed
to
its
finest
point
that
sixth
sense
of
the
animal
kingdom
the
sense
of
orientation
and
as
straight
as
a
pigeon
might
have
winged
its
flight
she
cut
through
the
bush
to
the
spot
where
they
had
cached
the
rabbit
a
white
fox
had
been
there
ahead
of
her
and
she
found
only
scattered
bits
of
hair
and
fur
what
the
fox
had
left
the
and
had
carried
away
hungrily
gray
wolf
turned
back
to
the
river
that
night
she
slept
again
where
kazan
had
lain
and
three
times
she
called
for
him
without
answer
a
heavy
dew
fell
and
it
drenched
the
last
vestige
of
her
mate
scent
out
of
the
sand
but
still
through
the
day
that
followed
and
the
day
that
followed
that
blind
gray
wolf
clung
to
the
narrow
rim
of
white
sand
on
the
fourth
day
her
hunger
reached
a
point
where
she
gnawed
the
bark
from
willow
bushes
it
was
on
this
day
that
she
made
a
discovery
she
was
drinking
when
her
sensitive
nose
touched
something
in
the
water
edge
that
was
smooth
and
bore
a
faint
odor
of
flesh
it
was
one
of
the
big
northern
river
clams
she
pawed
it
ashore
sniffing
at
the
hard
shell
then
she
crunched
it
between
her
teeth
she
had
never
tasted
sweeter
meat
than
that
which
she
found
inside
and
she
began
hunting
for
other
clams
she
found
many
of
them
and
ate
until
she
was
no
longer
hungry
for
three
days
more
she
remained
on
the
bar
and
then
one
night
the
call
came
to
her
it
set
her
quivering
with
a
strange
new
excitement
something
that
may
have
been
a
new
hope
and
in
the
moonlight
she
trotted
nervously
up
and
down
the
shining
strip
of
sand
facing
now
the
north
and
now
the
south
and
then
the
east
and
the
west
her
head
flung
up
listening
as
if
in
the
soft
wind
of
the
night
she
was
trying
to
locate
the
whispering
lure
of
a
wonderful
voice
and
whatever
it
was
that
came
to
her
came
from
out
of
the
south
and
east
off
there
across
the
barren
far
beyond
the
outer
edge
of
the
northern
was
and
off
there
in
her
brute
way
she
reasoned
that
she
must
find
kazan
the
call
did
not
come
from
their
old
windfall
home
in
the
swamp
it
came
from
beyond
that
and
in
a
flashing
vision
there
rose
through
her
blindness
a
picture
of
the
towering
sun
rock
of
the
winding
trail
that
led
to
it
and
the
cabin
on
the
plain
it
was
there
that
blindness
had
come
to
her
it
was
there
that
day
had
ended
and
eternal
night
had
begun
and
it
was
there
that
she
had
mothered
her
nature
had
registered
these
things
so
that
they
could
never
be
wiped
out
of
her
memory
and
when
the
call
came
it
was
from
the
sunlit
world
where
she
had
last
known
light
and
life
and
had
last
seen
the
moon
and
the
stars
in
the
blue
night
of
the
skies
and
to
that
call
she
responded
leaving
the
river
and
its
food
behind
her
straight
out
into
the
face
of
darkness
and
starvation
no
longer
fearing
death
or
the
emptiness
of
the
world
she
could
not
see
for
ahead
of
her
two
hundred
miles
away
she
could
see
the
sun
rock
the
winding
trail
the
nest
of
her
between
the
two
big
rocks
chapter
xxv
the
last
of
mctrigger
sixty
miles
farther
north
kazan
lay
at
the
end
of
his
fine
steel
chain
watching
little
professor
mcgill
mixing
a
pail
of
tallow
and
bran
a
dozen
yards
from
him
lay
the
big
dane
his
huge
jaws
drooling
in
anticipation
of
the
unusual
feast
which
mcgill
was
preparing
he
showed
signs
of
pleasure
when
mcgill
approached
him
with
a
quart
of
the
mixture
and
he
gulped
it
between
his
huge
jaws
the
little
man
with
the
cold
blue
eyes
and
the
hair
stroked
his
back
without
fear
his
attitude
was
different
when
he
turned
to
kazan
his
movements
were
filled
with
caution
and
yet
his
eyes
and
his
lips
were
smiling
and
he
gave
the
no
evidence
of
his
fear
if
it
could
be
called
fear
the
little
professor
who
was
up
in
the
north
country
for
the
smithsonian
institution
had
spent
a
third
of
his
life
among
dogs
he
loved
them
and
understood
them
he
had
written
a
number
of
magazine
articles
on
dog
intellect
that
had
attracted
wide
attention
among
naturalists
it
was
largely
because
he
loved
dogs
and
understood
them
more
than
most
men
that
he
had
bought
kazan
and
the
big
dane
on
the
night
when
sandy
mctrigger
and
his
partner
had
tried
to
get
them
to
fight
to
the
death
in
the
red
gold
city
saloon
the
refusal
of
the
two
splendid
beasts
to
kill
each
other
for
the
pleasure
of
the
three
hundred
men
who
had
assembled
to
witness
the
fight
delighted
him
he
had
already
planned
a
paper
on
the
incident
sandy
had
told
him
the
story
of
capture
and
of
his
wild
mate
gray
wolf
and
the
professor
had
asked
him
a
thousand
questions
but
each
day
kazan
puzzled
him
more
no
amount
of
kindness
on
his
part
could
bring
a
responsive
gleam
in
kazan
eyes
not
once
did
kazan
signify
a
willingness
to
become
friends
and
yet
he
did
not
snarl
at
mcgill
or
snap
at
his
hands
when
they
came
within
reach
quite
frequently
sandy
mctrigger
came
over
to
the
little
cabin
where
mcgill
was
staying
and
three
times
kazan
leaped
at
the
end
of
his
chain
to
get
at
him
and
his
white
fangs
gleamed
as
long
as
sandy
was
in
sight
alone
with
mcgill
he
became
quiet
something
told
him
that
mcgill
had
come
as
a
friend
that
night
when
he
and
the
big
dane
stood
shoulder
to
shoulder
in
the
cage
that
had
been
built
for
a
slaughter
pen
away
down
in
his
brute
heart
he
held
mcgill
apart
from
other
men
he
had
no
desire
to
harm
him
he
tolerated
him
but
showed
none
of
the
growing
affection
of
the
huge
dane
it
was
this
fact
that
puzzled
mcgill
he
had
never
before
known
a
dog
that
he
could
not
make
love
him
he
placed
the
tallow
and
bran
before
kazan
and
the
smile
in
his
face
gave
way
to
a
look
of
perplexity
kazan
lips
had
drawn
suddenly
back
a
fierce
snarl
rolled
deep
in
his
throat
the
hair
along
his
spine
stood
up
his
muscles
twitched
instinctively
the
professor
turned
sandy
mctrigger
had
come
up
quietly
behind
him
his
brutal
face
wore
a
grin
as
he
looked
at
kazan
it
a
fool
job
tryin
to
make
friends
with
he
said
then
he
added
with
a
sudden
interested
gleam
in
his
eyes
when
you
startin
with
first
frost
replied
mcgill
it
ought
to
come
soon
i
going
to
join
sergeant
conroy
and
his
party
at
fond
du
lac
by
the
first
of
october
and
you
going
up
to
fond
du
lac
alone
queried
sandy
why
you
take
a
man
the
little
professor
laughed
softly
why
he
asked
i
been
through
the
athabasca
waterways
a
dozen
times
and
know
the
trail
as
well
as
i
know
broadway
besides
i
like
to
be
alone
and
the
work
is
too
hard
with
the
currents
all
flowing
to
the
north
and
east
sandy
was
looking
at
the
dane
with
his
back
to
mcgill
an
exultant
gleam
shot
for
an
instant
into
his
eyes
you
taking
the
dogs
yes
sandy
lighted
his
pipe
and
spoke
like
one
strangely
curious
must
cost
a
heap
to
take
these
trips
o
yourn
do
it
my
last
cost
about
seven
thousand
dollars
this
will
cost
five
said
mcgill
gawd
breathed
sandy
an
you
carry
all
that
along
with
you
you
afraid
something
might
happen
the
little
professor
was
looking
the
other
way
now
the
carelessness
in
his
face
and
manner
changed
his
blue
eyes
grew
a
shade
darker
a
hard
smile
which
sandy
did
not
see
hovered
about
his
lips
for
an
instant
then
he
turned
laughing
i
a
very
light
sleeper
he
said
a
footstep
at
night
rouses
me
even
a
man
breathing
awakes
me
when
i
make
up
my
mind
that
i
must
be
on
my
guard
and
besides
he
drew
from
his
pocket
a
savage
automatic
i
know
how
to
use
he
pointed
to
a
knot
in
the
wall
of
the
cabin
observe
he
said
five
times
he
fired
at
twenty
paces
and
when
sandy
went
up
to
look
at
the
knot
he
gave
a
gasp
there
was
one
jagged
hole
where
the
knot
had
been
pretty
good
he
grinned
most
men
could
do
that
with
a
rifle
when
sandy
left
mcgill
followed
him
with
a
suspicious
gleam
in
his
eyes
and
a
curious
smile
on
his
lips
then
he
turned
to
kazan
guess
you
got
him
figgered
out
about
right
old
man
he
laughed
softly
i
do
blame
you
very
much
for
wanting
to
get
him
by
the
throat
perhaps
he
shoved
his
hands
deep
in
his
pockets
and
went
into
the
cabin
kazan
dropped
his
head
between
his
forepaws
and
lay
still
with
eyes
it
was
late
afternoon
early
in
september
and
each
night
brought
now
the
first
chill
breaths
of
autumn
kazan
watched
the
last
glow
of
the
sun
as
it
faded
out
of
the
southern
skies
darkness
always
followed
swiftly
after
that
and
with
darkness
came
more
fiercely
his
wild
longing
for
freedom
night
after
night
he
had
gnawed
at
his
steel
chain
night
after
night
he
had
watched
the
stars
and
the
moon
and
had
listened
for
gray
wolf
call
while
the
big
dane
lay
sleeping
it
was
colder
than
usual
and
the
keen
tang
of
the
wind
that
came
fresh
from
the
west
stirred
him
strangely
it
set
his
blood
afire
with
what
the
indians
call
the
frost
hunger
lethargic
summer
was
gone
and
the
days
and
nights
of
hunting
were
at
hand
he
wanted
to
leap
out
into
freedom
and
run
until
he
was
exhausted
with
gray
wolf
at
his
side
he
knew
that
gray
wolf
was
off
there
where
the
stars
hung
low
in
the
clear
sky
and
that
she
was
waiting
he
strained
at
the
end
of
his
chain
and
whined
all
that
night
he
was
restless
more
restless
than
he
had
been
at
any
time
before
once
in
the
far
distance
he
heard
a
cry
that
he
thought
was
the
cry
of
gray
wolf
and
his
answer
roused
mcgill
from
deep
sleep
it
was
dawn
and
the
little
professor
dressed
himself
and
came
out
of
the
cabin
with
satisfaction
he
noted
the
exhilarating
snap
in
the
air
he
wet
his
fingers
and
held
them
above
his
head
chuckling
when
he
found
the
wind
had
swung
into
the
north
he
went
to
kazan
and
talked
to
him
among
other
things
he
said
this
put
the
black
flies
to
sleep
kazan
a
day
or
two
more
of
it
and
we
start
five
days
later
mcgill
led
first
the
dane
and
then
kazan
to
a
packed
canoe
sandy
mctrigger
saw
them
off
and
kazan
watched
for
a
chance
to
leap
at
him
sandy
kept
his
distance
and
mcgill
watched
the
two
with
a
thought
that
set
the
blood
running
swiftly
behind
the
mask
of
his
careless
smile
they
had
slipped
a
mile
when
he
leaned
over
and
laid
a
fearless
hand
on
kazan
head
something
in
the
touch
of
that
hand
and
in
the
professor
voice
kept
kazan
from
a
desire
to
snap
at
him
he
tolerated
the
friendship
with
expressionless
eyes
and
a
motionless
body
i
was
beginning
to
fear
i
would
have
much
sleep
old
boy
chuckled
mcgill
ambiguously
but
i
guess
i
can
take
a
nap
now
and
then
with
along
he
made
camp
that
night
fifteen
miles
up
the
lake
shore
the
big
dane
he
fastened
to
a
sapling
twenty
yards
from
his
small
silk
tent
but
chain
he
made
fast
to
the
butt
of
a
stunted
birch
that
held
down
the
before
he
went
into
the
tent
for
the
night
mcgill
pulled
out
his
automatic
and
examined
it
with
care
for
three
days
the
journey
continued
without
a
mishap
along
the
shore
of
lake
athabasca
on
the
fourth
night
mcgill
pitched
his
tent
in
a
clump
of
pine
a
hundred
yards
back
from
the
water
all
that
day
the
wind
had
come
steadily
from
behind
them
and
for
at
least
a
half
of
the
day
the
professor
had
been
watching
kazan
closely
from
the
west
there
had
now
and
then
come
a
scent
that
stirred
him
uneasily
since
noon
he
had
sniffed
that
wind
twice
mcgill
had
heard
him
growling
deep
in
his
throat
and
once
when
the
scent
had
come
stronger
than
usual
he
had
bared
his
fangs
and
the
bristles
stood
up
along
his
spine
for
an
hour
after
striking
camp
the
little
professor
did
not
build
a
fire
but
sat
looking
up
the
shore
of
the
lake
through
his
hunting
glass
it
was
dusk
when
he
returned
to
where
he
had
put
up
his
tent
and
chained
the
dogs
for
a
few
moments
he
stood
unobserved
looking
at
the
kazan
was
still
uneasy
he
lay
the
west
mcgill
made
note
of
this
for
the
big
dane
lay
behind
kazan
to
the
east
under
ordinary
conditions
kazan
would
have
faced
him
he
was
sure
now
that
there
was
something
in
the
west
wind
a
little
shiver
ran
up
his
back
as
he
thought
of
what
it
might
be
behind
a
rock
he
built
a
very
small
fire
and
prepared
supper
after
this
he
went
into
the
tent
and
when
he
came
out
he
carried
a
blanket
under
his
arm
he
chuckled
as
he
stood
for
a
moment
over
kazan
we
not
going
to
sleep
in
there
old
hoy
he
said
i
like
what
you
found
in
the
west
wind
it
may
he
a
he
laughed
at
his
joke
and
buried
himself
in
a
clump
of
stunted
thirty
paces
from
the
tent
here
he
rolled
himself
in
his
blanket
and
went
to
sleep
it
was
a
quiet
starlit
night
and
hours
afterward
kazan
dropped
his
nose
between
his
forepaws
and
drowsed
it
was
the
snap
of
a
twig
that
roused
him
the
sound
did
not
awaken
the
sluggish
dane
but
instantly
head
was
alert
his
keen
nostrils
sniffing
the
air
what
he
had
smelled
all
day
was
heavy
about
him
now
he
lay
still
and
quivering
slowly
from
out
of
the
behind
the
tent
there
came
a
figure
it
was
not
the
little
professor
it
approached
cautiously
with
lowered
head
and
hunched
shoulders
and
the
starlight
revealed
the
murderous
face
of
sandy
mctrigger
kazan
crouched
low
he
laid
his
head
flat
between
his
forepaws
his
long
fangs
gleamed
but
he
made
no
sound
that
betrayed
his
concealment
under
a
thick
shrub
step
by
step
sandy
approached
and
at
last
he
reached
the
flap
of
the
tent
he
did
not
carry
a
club
or
a
whip
in
his
hand
now
in
the
place
of
either
of
those
was
the
glitter
of
steel
at
the
door
to
the
tent
he
paused
and
peered
in
his
back
to
kazan
silently
swiftly
the
wolf
now
in
every
movement
kazan
came
to
his
feet
he
forgot
the
chain
that
held
him
ten
feet
away
stood
the
enemy
he
hated
above
all
others
he
had
ever
known
every
ounce
of
strength
in
his
splendid
body
gathered
itself
for
the
spring
and
then
he
leaped
this
time
the
chain
did
not
pull
him
back
almost
age
and
the
elements
had
weakened
the
leather
collar
he
had
worn
since
the
days
of
his
slavery
in
the
traces
and
it
gave
way
with
a
snap
sandy
turned
and
in
a
second
leap
kazan
fangs
sank
into
the
flesh
of
his
arm
with
a
startled
cry
the
man
fell
and
as
they
rolled
over
on
the
ground
the
big
dane
deep
voice
rolled
out
in
thunderous
alarm
as
he
tugged
at
his
leash
in
the
fall
kazan
hold
was
broken
in
an
instant
he
was
on
his
feet
ready
for
another
attack
and
then
the
change
came
he
was
the
collar
was
gone
from
his
neck
the
forest
the
stars
the
whispering
wind
were
all
about
him
were
men
and
off
there
was
gray
wolf
his
ears
dropped
and
he
turned
swiftly
and
slipped
like
a
shadow
back
into
the
glorious
freedom
of
his
world
a
hundred
yards
away
something
stopped
him
for
an
instant
it
was
not
the
big
dane
voice
but
the
sharp
crack
of
the
little
professor
automatic
and
above
that
sound
there
rose
the
voice
of
sandy
mctrigger
in
a
weird
and
terrible
cry
chapter
xxvi
an
empty
world
mile
after
mile
kazan
went
on
for
a
time
he
was
oppressed
by
the
shivering
note
of
death
that
had
come
to
him
in
sandy
mctrigger
cry
and
he
slipped
through
the
like
a
shadow
his
ears
flattened
his
tail
trailing
his
hindquarters
betraying
that
curious
slinking
quality
of
the
wolf
and
dog
stealing
away
from
danger
then
he
came
out
upon
a
plain
and
the
stillness
the
billion
stars
in
the
clear
vault
of
the
sky
and
the
keen
air
that
carried
with
it
a
breath
of
the
arctic
barrens
made
him
alert
and
questioning
he
faced
the
direction
of
the
wind
somewhere
off
there
far
to
the
south
and
west
was
gray
wolf
for
the
first
time
in
many
weeks
he
sat
back
on
his
haunches
and
gave
the
deep
and
vibrant
call
that
echoed
weirdly
for
miles
about
him
back
in
the
the
big
dane
heard
it
and
whined
from
over
the
still
body
of
sandy
mctrigger
the
little
professor
looked
up
with
a
white
tense
face
and
listened
for
a
second
cry
but
instinct
told
kazan
that
to
that
first
call
there
would
be
no
answer
and
now
he
struck
out
swiftly
galloping
mile
after
mile
as
a
dog
follows
the
trail
of
its
master
home
he
did
not
turn
hack
to
the
lake
nor
was
his
direction
toward
red
gold
city
as
straight
as
he
might
have
followed
a
road
blazed
by
the
hand
of
man
he
cut
across
the
forty
miles
of
plain
and
swamp
and
forest
and
rocky
ridge
that
lay
between
him
and
the
mcfarlane
all
that
night
he
did
not
call
again
for
gray
wolf
with
him
reasoning
was
a
process
brought
about
by
habit
by
precedent
and
as
gray
wolf
had
waited
for
him
many
times
before
he
knew
that
she
would
be
waiting
for
him
now
near
the
by
dawn
he
had
reached
the
river
within
three
miles
of
the
scarcely
was
the
sun
up
when
he
stood
on
the
white
strip
of
sand
where
he
and
gray
wolf
had
come
down
to
drink
expectantly
and
confidently
he
looked
about
him
for
gray
wolf
whining
softly
and
wagging
his
tail
he
began
to
search
for
her
scent
but
rains
had
washed
even
her
footprints
from
the
clean
sand
all
that
day
he
searched
for
her
along
the
river
and
out
on
the
plain
he
went
to
where
they
had
killed
their
last
rabbit
he
sniffed
at
the
bushes
where
the
poison
baits
had
hung
again
and
again
he
sat
back
on
his
haunches
and
sent
out
his
mating
cry
to
her
and
slowly
as
he
did
these
things
nature
was
working
in
him
that
miracle
of
the
wild
which
the
crees
have
named
the
spirit
call
as
it
had
worked
in
gray
wolf
so
now
it
stirred
the
blood
of
kazan
with
the
going
of
the
sun
and
the
sweeping
about
him
of
shadowy
night
he
turned
more
and
more
to
the
south
and
east
his
whole
world
was
made
up
of
the
trails
over
which
he
had
hunted
beyond
those
places
he
did
not
know
that
there
was
such
a
thing
as
existence
and
in
that
world
small
in
his
understanding
of
things
was
gray
wolf
he
could
not
miss
her
that
world
in
his
comprehension
of
it
ran
from
the
mcfarlane
in
a
narrow
trail
through
the
forests
and
over
the
plains
to
the
little
valley
from
which
the
beavers
had
driven
them
if
gray
wolf
was
not
here
she
was
there
and
tirelessly
he
resumed
his
quest
of
her
not
until
the
stars
were
fading
out
of
the
sky
again
and
gray
day
was
giving
place
to
night
did
exhaustion
and
hunger
stop
him
he
killed
a
rabbit
and
for
hours
after
he
had
feasted
he
lay
close
to
his
kill
and
slept
then
he
went
on
the
fourth
night
he
came
to
the
little
valley
between
the
two
ridges
and
under
the
stars
more
brilliant
now
in
the
chill
clearness
of
the
early
autumn
nights
he
followed
the
creek
down
into
their
old
swamp
home
it
was
broad
day
when
he
reached
the
edge
of
the
great
beaver
pond
that
now
completely
surrounded
the
windfall
under
which
had
come
into
the
world
broken
tooth
and
the
other
beavers
had
wrought
a
big
change
in
what
had
once
been
his
home
and
gray
wolf
and
for
many
minutes
kazan
stood
silent
and
motionless
at
the
edge
of
the
pond
sniffing
the
air
heavy
with
the
unpleasant
odor
of
the
usurpers
until
now
his
spirit
had
remained
unbroken
footsore
with
thinned
sides
and
gaunt
head
he
circled
slowly
through
the
swamp
all
that
day
he
searched
and
his
crest
lay
flat
now
and
there
was
a
hunted
look
in
the
droop
of
his
shoulders
and
in
the
shifting
look
of
his
eyes
gray
wolf
was
gone
slowly
nature
was
impinging
that
fact
upon
him
she
had
passed
out
of
his
world
and
out
of
his
life
and
he
was
filled
with
a
loneliness
and
a
grief
so
great
that
the
forest
seemed
strange
and
the
stillness
of
the
wild
a
thing
that
now
oppressed
and
frightened
him
once
more
the
dog
in
him
was
mastering
the
wolf
with
gray
wolf
he
had
possessed
the
world
of
freedom
without
her
that
world
was
so
big
and
strange
and
empty
that
it
appalled
him
late
in
the
afternoon
he
came
upon
a
little
pile
of
crushed
clamshells
on
the
shore
of
the
stream
he
sniffed
at
them
turned
away
went
back
and
sniffed
again
it
was
where
gray
wolf
had
made
a
last
feast
in
the
swamp
before
continuing
south
but
the
scent
she
had
left
behind
was
not
strong
enough
to
tell
kazan
and
for
a
second
time
he
turned
away
that
night
he
slunk
under
a
log
and
cried
himself
to
sleep
deep
in
the
night
he
grieved
in
his
uneasy
slumber
like
a
child
and
day
after
day
and
night
after
night
kazan
remained
a
slinking
creature
of
the
big
swamp
mourning
for
the
one
creature
that
had
brought
him
out
of
chaos
into
light
who
had
filled
his
world
for
him
and
who
in
going
from
him
had
taken
from
this
world
even
the
things
that
gray
wolf
had
lost
in
her
blindness
chapter
xxvii
the
call
of
sun
rock
in
the
golden
glow
of
the
autumn
sun
there
came
up
the
stream
overlooked
by
the
sun
rock
one
day
a
man
a
woman
and
a
child
in
a
canoe
civilization
had
done
for
lovely
joan
what
it
had
done
for
many
another
wild
flower
transplanted
from
the
depths
of
the
wilderness
her
cheeks
were
thin
her
blue
eyes
had
lost
their
luster
she
coughed
and
when
she
coughed
the
man
looked
at
her
with
love
and
fear
in
his
eyes
but
now
slowly
the
man
had
begun
to
see
the
transformation
and
on
the
day
their
canoe
pointed
up
the
stream
and
into
the
wonderful
valley
that
had
been
their
home
before
the
call
of
the
distant
city
came
to
them
he
noted
the
flush
gathering
once
more
in
her
cheeks
the
fuller
redness
of
her
lips
and
the
gathering
glow
of
happiness
and
content
in
her
eyes
he
laughed
softly
as
he
saw
these
things
and
he
blessed
the
forests
in
the
canoe
she
had
leaned
back
with
her
head
almost
against
his
shoulder
and
he
stopped
paddling
to
draw
her
to
him
and
run
his
fingers
through
the
soft
golden
masses
of
her
hair
you
are
happy
again
joan
he
laughed
joyously
the
doctors
were
right
you
are
a
part
of
the
forests
yes
i
am
happy
she
whispered
and
suddenly
there
came
a
little
thrill
into
her
voice
and
she
pointed
to
a
white
finger
of
sand
running
out
into
the
stream
do
you
remember
years
and
years
ago
it
seems
that
kazan
left
us
here
was
on
the
sand
over
there
calling
to
him
do
you
remember
there
was
a
little
tremble
about
her
mouth
and
she
added
i
wonder
where
they
have
gone
the
cabin
was
as
they
had
left
it
only
the
crimson
had
grown
up
about
it
and
shrubs
and
tall
grass
had
sprung
up
near
its
walls
once
more
it
took
on
life
and
day
by
day
the
color
came
deeper
into
joan
cheeks
and
her
voice
was
filled
with
its
old
wild
sweetness
of
song
joan
husband
cleared
the
trails
over
his
old
and
joan
and
the
little
joan
who
romped
and
talked
now
transformed
the
cabin
into
one
night
the
man
returned
to
the
cabin
late
and
when
he
came
in
there
was
a
glow
of
excitement
in
joan
blue
eyes
and
a
tremble
in
her
voice
when
she
greeted
him
did
you
hear
it
she
asked
did
you
hear
he
nodded
stroking
her
soft
hair
i
was
a
mile
back
in
the
creek
swamp
he
said
i
heard
it
joan
hands
clutched
his
arms
it
was
kazan
she
said
i
would
recognize
voice
but
it
seemed
to
me
it
was
like
the
other
the
call
that
came
that
morning
from
the
his
the
man
was
thinking
joan
fingers
tightened
she
was
breathing
a
little
quickly
will
you
promise
me
this
she
asked
will
you
promise
me
that
you
will
never
hunt
or
trap
for
wolves
i
had
thought
of
that
he
replied
i
thought
of
it
after
i
heard
the
call
yes
i
will
promise
joan
arms
stole
up
about
his
neck
we
loved
kazan
she
whispered
and
you
might
kill
him
or
suddenly
she
stopped
both
listened
the
door
was
a
little
ajar
and
to
them
there
came
again
the
wailing
of
the
wolf
joan
ran
to
the
door
her
husband
followed
together
they
stood
silent
and
with
tense
breath
joan
pointed
over
the
starlit
plain
listen
listen
she
commanded
it
her
cry
it
came
from
the
sun
she
ran
out
into
the
night
forgetting
that
the
man
was
close
behind
her
now
forgetting
that
little
joan
was
alone
in
her
bed
and
to
them
from
miles
and
miles
across
the
plain
there
came
a
wailing
cry
in
answer
a
cry
that
seemed
a
part
of
the
wind
and
that
thrilled
joan
until
her
breath
broke
in
a
strange
sob
farther
out
on
the
plain
she
went
and
then
stopped
with
the
golden
glow
of
the
autumn
moon
and
the
stars
shimmering
in
her
hair
and
eyes
it
was
many
minutes
before
the
cry
came
again
and
then
it
was
so
near
that
joan
put
her
hands
to
her
mouth
and
her
cry
rang
out
over
the
plain
as
in
the
days
of
old
kazan
at
the
top
of
the
sun
rock
gray
wolf
gaunt
and
thinned
by
starvation
heard
the
woman
cry
and
the
call
that
was
in
her
throat
died
away
in
a
whine
and
to
the
north
a
swiftly
moving
shadow
stopped
for
a
moment
and
stood
like
a
thing
of
rock
under
the
starlight
it
was
kazan
a
strange
fire
leaped
through
his
body
every
fiber
of
his
brute
understanding
was
afire
with
the
knowledge
that
here
was
it
was
here
long
ago
that
he
had
lived
and
loved
and
fought
and
all
at
once
the
dreams
that
had
grown
faded
and
indistinct
in
his
memory
came
back
to
him
as
real
living
things
for
coming
to
him
faintly
over
the
plain
heard
joan
voice
in
the
starlight
joan
stood
tense
and
white
when
from
out
of
the
pale
mists
of
the
he
came
to
her
cringing
on
his
belly
panting
and
and
with
a
strange
whining
note
in
his
throat
and
as
joan
went
to
him
her
arms
reaching
out
her
lips
sobbing
his
name
over
and
over
again
the
man
stood
and
looked
down
upon
them
with
the
wonder
of
a
new
and
greater
understanding
in
his
face
he
had
no
fear
of
the
now
and
as
joan
arms
hugged
kazan
great
shaggy
head
up
to
her
he
heard
the
whining
gasping
joy
of
the
beast
and
the
sobbing
whispering
voice
of
the
girl
and
with
tensely
gripped
hands
he
faced
the
sun
rock
my
gawd
he
breathed
i
believe
it
so
as
if
in
response
to
the
thought
in
his
mind
there
came
once
more
across
the
plain
gray
wolf
cry
of
grief
and
of
loneliness
swiftly
as
though
struck
by
a
lash
kazan
was
on
his
feet
oblivious
of
joan
touch
of
her
voice
of
the
presence
of
the
man
in
another
instant
he
was
gone
and
joan
flung
herself
against
her
husband
breast
and
almost
fiercely
took
his
face
between
her
two
hands
do
you
believe
she
cried
pantingly
do
you
believe
in
the
god
of
my
world
the
god
i
have
lived
with
the
god
that
gives
souls
to
the
wild
things
the
god
that
that
has
brought
us
all
together
once
more
his
arms
closed
gently
about
her
i
believe
my
joan
he
whispered
and
you
understand
now
what
it
means
shalt
not
kill
except
that
it
brings
us
life
yes
i
understand
he
replied
her
warm
soft
hands
stroked
his
face
her
blue
eyes
filled
with
the
glory
of
the
stars
looked
up
into
his
kazan
and
you
and
i
and
the
baby
are
you
sorry
that
we
came
back
she
asked
so
close
he
drew
her
against
his
breast
that
she
did
not
hear
the
words
he
whispered
in
the
soft
warmth
of
her
hair
and
after
that
for
many
hours
they
sat
in
the
starlight
in
front
of
the
cabin
door
but
they
did
not
hear
again
that
lonely
cry
from
the
sun
rock
joan
and
her
husband
understood
he
visit
us
again
the
man
said
at
last
come
joan
let
us
go
to
bed
together
they
entered
the
cabin
and
that
night
side
by
side
kazan
and
gray
wolf
hunted
again
in
the
moonlit
plain
