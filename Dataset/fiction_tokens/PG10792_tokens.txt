keeping
up
appearances
everybody
is
superstitious
said
the
as
he
gave
utterance
to
a
series
of
chirruping
endearments
to
a
black
cat
with
one
eye
that
had
just
been
using
a
leg
of
his
trousers
as
a
serviette
if
that
cat
stole
some
men
suppers
they
have
acted
foolish
and
suffered
for
it
all
the
rest
of
their
lives
he
scratched
the
cat
behind
the
ear
and
despite
himself
his
face
darkened
slung
it
over
the
side
they
would
he
said
longingly
and
chucked
bits
o
coke
at
it
till
it
sank
as
i
said
afore
everybody
is
superstitious
and
those
that
ai
ought
to
be
for
a
time
that
cure
i
knew
one
man
that
killed
a
black
cat
and
arter
that
for
the
rest
of
his
life
he
could
never
get
three
sheets
in
the
wind
without
seeing
its
ghost
spoilt
his
life
for
it
did
he
scratched
the
cat
other
ear
i
only
left
it
a
moment
while
i
went
round
to
the
bull
head
he
said
slowly
filling
his
pipe
and
i
thought
i
put
it
out
o
reach
some
men
his
fingers
twined
round
the
animal
neck
then
with
a
sigh
he
rose
and
took
a
turn
or
two
on
the
jetty
superstitiousness
is
right
and
proper
to
a
certain
extent
he
said
resuming
his
seat
but
o
course
like
everything
else
some
people
carry
it
too
far
they
believe
anything
they
are
and
if
you
in
no
hurry
i
can
tell
you
a
tale
of
a
pal
o
mine
bill
burtenshaw
by
name
that
prove
my
words
illustration
superstitiousness
is
right
and
proper
to
a
certain
extent
his
mother
was
superstitious
afore
and
always
knew
when
friends
died
by
hearing
three
loud
taps
on
the
wall
the
mistake
she
ever
made
was
one
night
when
arter
losing
no
less
than
seven
friends
she
found
out
it
was
the
man
next
door
hanging
pictures
at
three
in
the
morning
she
found
it
out
by
hitting
for
the
first
few
years
arter
he
grew
up
bill
went
to
sea
and
that
made
more
superstitious
than
ever
him
and
a
pal
named
silas
winch
went
several
together
and
their
talk
used
to
be
that
creepy
that
some
o
the
chaps
was
afraid
to
be
left
on
deck
alone
of
a
night
silas
was
a
miserable
sort
o
chap
always
looking
on
the
black
side
o
things
and
shaking
his
over
it
he
thought
nothing
o
seeing
ghosts
and
pore
old
ben
huggins
slept
on
the
floor
for
a
week
by
reason
of
a
ghost
with
its
throat
cut
that
silas
saw
in
his
bunk
he
gave
silas
arf
a
dollar
and
a
to
change
bunks
with
when
bill
burtenshaw
left
the
sea
and
got
married
he
lost
sight
of
silas
altogether
and
the
thing
he
to
remind
him
of
was
a
piece
paper
which
they
both
signed
with
their
blood
promising
that
the
fust
one
that
died
would
appear
to
the
other
bill
agreed
to
it
one
evenin
when
he
did
know
wot
he
was
doing
and
for
years
arterwards
used
to
get
the
cold
creeps
down
back
when
he
thought
of
silas
dying
fust
and
the
idea
of
dying
fust
gave
cold
creeps
all
over
bill
was
a
very
good
husband
when
he
was
sober
but
money
was
two
pounds
a
week
and
when
a
man
has
all
that
and
a
wife
to
keep
out
of
it
it
natural
for
to
drink
burtenshaw
tried
all
sorts
ways
and
means
of
curing
but
it
was
no
use
bill
used
to
think
ways
too
knowing
the
the
drink
was
doing
and
his
plan
was
for
missis
to
empty
a
bucket
o
cold
water
over
every
time
he
came
the
worse
for
licker
she
did
it
once
but
as
she
to
spend
the
rest
o
the
night
in
the
back
yard
it
was
tried
again
bill
got
worse
as
he
got
older
and
even
made
away
with
the
furniture
to
get
drink
with
and
then
he
used
to
tell
missis
that
he
was
drove
to
the
pub
because
his
was
so
uncomfortable
just
at
that
time
things
was
at
their
worst
silas
winch
who
to
be
ashore
and
got
bill
address
from
a
pal
called
to
see
it
was
a
saturday
arternoon
when
he
called
and
o
course
bill
was
out
but
missis
showed
him
in
and
arter
fetching
another
chair
from
the
kitchen
asked
to
sit
down
silas
was
very
perlite
at
fust
but
arter
looking
round
the
room
and
seeing
bare
it
was
he
gave
a
little
cough
and
he
ses
i
thought
bill
was
doing
well
he
ses
illustration
silas
was
very
perlite
at
fust
so
he
is
ses
burtenshaw
silas
winch
coughed
again
i
suppose
he
likes
room
to
stretch
about
in
he
ses
looking
round
burtenshaw
wiped
eyes
and
then
knowing
silas
had
been
an
old
friend
o
bill
she
drew
chair
a
bit
closer
and
told
him
it
was
a
better
when
he
sober
you
could
wish
to
see
she
ses
wiping
her
eyes
agin
he
give
me
anything
if
he
it
silas
face
got
longer
than
ever
as
a
matter
o
fact
he
ses
i
a
bit
down
on
my
luck
and
i
called
round
with
the
that
bill
could
lend
me
a
bit
just
till
i
can
pull
round
burtenshaw
shook
her
well
i
i
can
stay
and
see
ses
silas
me
and
used
to
be
great
pals
at
one
time
and
many
the
good
turn
i
done
him
wot
time
he
be
any
time
after
twelve
ses
burtenshaw
but
you
better
not
be
here
then
you
see
being
in
that
condition
he
might
think
you
was
your
own
ghost
come
according
to
promise
and
be
frightened
out
of
life
he
often
talked
about
it
silas
winch
scratched
his
head
and
looked
at
why
should
he
mistake
me
for
a
ghost
he
ses
at
last
the
shock
might
do
good
and
if
you
come
to
that
why
should
i
pretend
to
be
my
own
ghost
and
warn
off
the
drink
burtenshaw
got
so
excited
at
the
idea
she
could
speak
but
at
last
arter
saying
over
and
over
agin
she
would
do
such
a
thing
for
worlds
she
and
silas
arranged
that
he
should
come
in
at
about
three
in
the
morning
and
give
bill
a
solemn
warning
she
gave
her
key
and
silas
said
he
come
in
with
his
and
cap
all
wet
and
pretend
he
been
drowned
it
very
kind
of
you
to
take
all
this
trouble
for
nothing
ses
burtenshaw
as
silas
got
up
to
go
do
mention
it
ses
silas
it
ai
the
fust
time
and
i
suppose
it
be
the
last
that
i
put
myself
out
to
help
my
creeturs
we
all
ought
to
do
wot
we
can
for
each
other
mind
if
he
finds
it
out
ses
burtenshaw
all
of
a
tremble
i
do
know
nothing
about
it
to
make
it
more
better
pretend
not
to
see
you
it
would
be
better
ses
silas
stopping
at
the
street
door
all
i
ask
is
that
you
the
poker
and
anything
else
that
might
be
laying
about
handy
and
you
better
oil
the
lock
so
as
the
key
make
a
noise
burtenshaw
shut
the
door
arter
and
then
she
went
in
and
a
quiet
all
by
to
think
it
over
the
only
thing
that
comforted
was
that
bill
would
be
in
licker
and
also
that
would
believe
anything
in
the
ghost
line
it
was
past
twelve
when
a
couple
o
pals
brought
him
and
arter
offering
to
fight
all
six
of
one
after
the
other
bill
hit
the
wall
for
getting
in
way
and
tumbled
upstairs
to
bed
in
less
than
ten
minutes
was
fast
asleep
and
pore
burtenshaw
arter
trying
her
best
to
keep
awake
fell
asleep
too
she
was
woke
up
suddenly
by
a
noise
that
froze
the
marrer
in
bones
the
most
groan
she
ever
heard
in
life
and
raising
her
she
saw
silas
winch
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
he
done
his
face
and
hands
over
with
wot
is
called
loominous
paint
his
cap
was
pushed
at
the
back
of
his
and
wet
wisps
of
was
hanging
over
his
eyes
for
a
moment
burtenshaw
stood
still
and
then
silas
let
off
another
groan
that
put
her
on
edge
all
over
it
was
a
groan
that
seemed
to
come
from
nothing
until
it
spread
into
a
roar
that
made
the
room
tremble
and
rattled
the
jug
in
the
basin
it
shook
everything
in
the
room
but
bill
and
he
went
on
sleeping
like
an
infant
silas
did
two
more
groans
and
then
leaned
over
the
foot
the
bed
and
stared
at
bill
as
though
could
believe
his
eyesight
illustration
she
saw
silas
winch
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
try
a
squeaky
one
ses
burtenshaw
silas
tried
five
squeaky
ones
and
then
he
a
fit
o
coughing
that
would
ha
woke
the
dead
as
they
say
but
it
did
wake
bill
now
some
more
deep
ones
ses
burtenshaw
in
a
silas
licked
his
lips
forgetting
the
paint
and
tried
the
deep
ones
agin
now
mix
a
bit
ses
burtenshaw
silas
stared
at
her
look
he
ses
very
short
do
you
think
a
or
wot
he
stood
there
sulky
for
a
moment
and
then
invented
a
noise
that
nothing
living
could
miss
hearing
even
bill
could
he
moved
in
sleep
and
arter
silas
done
it
twice
more
he
turned
and
spoke
to
missis
about
it
d
hear
he
ses
stop
it
stop
it
at
once
burtenshaw
pretended
to
be
asleep
and
bill
was
just
going
to
turn
over
agin
when
silas
let
off
another
groan
it
was
a
little
one
this
time
but
bill
sat
up
as
though
he
been
shot
and
he
no
sooner
caught
sight
of
silas
standing
there
than
gave
a
dreadful
and
rolling
over
wropped
up
in
all
the
could
lay
his
on
then
burtenshaw
gave
a
and
tried
to
get
some
of
back
but
bill
thinking
it
was
the
ghost
only
held
on
tighter
than
ever

ses
silas

in
an
awful
voice

said
and
arter
a
long
silence
he
ventured
to
put
an
eye
over
the
edge
of
the
clothes
and
discovered
that

ghost
gone
he
lay
awake
for
a
couple
o
hours
wondering
and
saying
over
the
address
to
himself
so
that
he
should
forget
it
and
just
afore
it
was
time
to
get
up
he
fell
into
a
