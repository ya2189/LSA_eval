come

cried
the
preacher
even
from
the
island
of
koiau
which
floats
as
a
green
leaf
upon
the
untroubled
sea
there
reigneth
eternal
summer
but
there
reigneth
not
the
eternal
god
in
the
hearts
of
the
heathen
koiau
is
one
of
the
dark
places
of
the
earth
there
prospect
pleases
and
only
man
is
vile
yet
the
lord
hath
not
forgotten
his
people
the
light
of
the
gospel
glimmers
amid
the
gloom
and
ours
brethren
must
be
the
task
of
pouring
oil
into
the
lamp
that
the
flame
may
illuminate
those
who
walk
in
darkness
buli
the
high
chief
of
the
island
inclines
his
ear
to
the
words
of
salvation
he
hath
given
a
hostage
to
the
lord
yea
verily
for
doth
not
his
only
child
abide
in
the
tabernacles
of
zion
dwelleth
she
not
in
the
land
of
goshen
tera
she
was
bithiah
she
is
which
being
interpreted
meaneth
of
the
lord
she
a
brand
plucked
from
the
burning
shall
yet
herald
the
dawn
of
pure
religion
in
her
heathen
cradle
shall
blossom
abundantly
and
rejoice
even
with
joy
and
singing
the
speaker
whose
zeal
thus
confused
his
metaphors
was
a
herculean
man
of
some
fifty
years
he
was
clothed
in
rough
blue
serge
wind
and
spray
had
reddened
his
rugged
face
his
hair
and
short
beard
and
grizzled
were
in
disorder
and
the
light
of
enthusiasm
brightened
his
grey
eyes
peering
from
under
their
shaggy
brows
he
had
the
appearance
of
a
and
his
raucous
voice
rumbled
through
the
building
as
though
it
were
carrying
orders
through
the
storming
of
a
gale
through
long
study
of
the
bible
he
had
become
possessed
of
a
certain
elevated
phraseology
and
couching
his
everyday
experiences
in
this
he
managed
to
deliver
a
lurid
and
picturesque
discourse
which
enthralled
his
hearers
before
him
now
in
the
bare
pews
of
their
place
of
worship
some
twenty
or
more
of
these
were
seated
they
were
demure
folk
and
their
chapel
was
tiny
diminutive
even
its
walls
were
innocent
of
decoration
simply
whitewashed
its
windows
plain
glass
before
a
deal
rostrum
up
to
which
on
either
side
led
steps
to
a
the
preacher
now
gesticulated
and
thundered
the
majority
of
the
congregation
were
women
some
old
some
young
but
all
were
clothed
in
the
plainest
of
garments
their
close
quakerish
caps
hiding
their
hair
in
contrast
to
these
their
faces
pallid
and
expression
impassive
there
sat
almost
immediately
below
the
missionary
a
dark
and
splendid
girl
of
or
thereabouts
with
a
vivacious
smiling
face
she
was
the
tera
bithiah
so
eloquently
referred
to
by
the
speaker
in
deference
to
her
savage
love
of
colour
and
her
rank
as
a
king
daughter
she
was
permitted
to
indulge
somewhat
in
feminine
fripperies
of
this
latitude
she
did
not
fail
to
take
full
advantage
no
parrot
of
her
native
isles
ever
spread
a
finer
plumage
than
did
tera
a
dark
blue
dress
a
bright
scarlet
shawl
a
wonderful
straw
hat
trimmed
with
poppies
and
cornflowers
she
glowed
like
a
jewel
in
that
sombre
conventicle
she
was
in
no
wise
embarrassed
by
the
pointed
reference
of
the
missionary
her
rank
and
good
looks
accustomed
her
to
observation
and
indeed
to
admiration
moreover
as
a
native
convert
she
was
thought
much
of
by
the
congregation
at
grimleigh
and
sat
among
them
as
a
sign
that
the
good
work
would
prosper
in
the
island
of
koiau
it
was
this
impression
that
korah
brand
former
sailor
and
present
missionary
wished
to
produce
hence
his
use
of
her
as
an
am
black
but
comely
quoted
brand
in
a
strain
of
doubtful
compliment
to
tera
king
daughter
as
i
am
so
are
those
of
my
race
who
yet
bow
down
to
idols
of
stone
the
of
men
hands
then
the
preacher
passed
into
a
description
of
the
fierce
heathen
worship
which
christianity
was
to
destroy
tera
eyes
flashed
and
her
nostrils
dilated
as
brand
painted
the
idol
ceremonies
with
natural
eloquence
she
too
knew
of
the
trilithon
in
the
dark
forest
where
scowled
the
terrible
god
lomangatini
she
also
had
seen
the
limestone
altar
which
had
streamed
so
often
with
human
blood
these
things
fables
to
her
neighbours
were
realities
to
her
and
the
hot
barbaric
blood
sang
in
her
veins
with
quick
response
to
the
home
picture
after
a
time
the
missionary
began
to
describe
the
island
and
tera
fancy
ran
before
his
words
to
where
koiau
lay
amid
leagues
of
shining
seas
beneath
the
wider
skies
of
the
underworld
the
lines
of
feathery
palms
the
long
rollers
crumbling
on
the
ragged
reef
the
still
lagoon
where
the
darted
amongst
branching
coral
of
rainbow
hues
picture
after
picture
presented
itself
to
her
mind
and
faded
to
leave
her
sick
for
home
in
this
grey
island
of
sunless
skies
and
chilling
mists
she
was
as
one
in
the
pale
realms
of
the
dead
to
distract
her
thoughts
which
were
too
much
for
her
she
glanced
round
at
the
attentive
congregation
there
with
the
elders
sat
farmer
carwell
his
jolly
red
face
filled
with
interest
and
awe
near
her
his
daughter
rachel
pale
and
pretty
leaned
forward
to
catch
every
word
of
the
discourse
and
beside
the
door
herbert
mayne
the
yeoman
squire
also
leaned
forward
but
less
to
hear
the
preacher
than
to
catch
a
loving
glance
from
rachel
bright
eyes
present
also
was
miss
arnott
a
lean
demure
woman
who
had
been
an
actress
in
her
youth
but
who
stirred
by
a
chance
word
had
left
the
booths
of
satan
for
the
tabernacle
of
zion
she
was
gazing
ardently
at
a
pale
man
seated
on
a
cane
chair
near
the
rostrum
and
guided
by
the
intensity
of
the
look
tera
let
her
eyes
stray
in
the
same
direction
yet
there
was
little
in
the
appearance
of
johnson
to
attract
the
eye
johnson
the
rev
george
was
the
minister
of
the
grimleigh
bethesda
which
was
also
known
locally
as
bethgamul
the
house
of
recompense
this
tall
slender
expounder
of
the
word
had
been
a
missionary
in
the
south
seas
some
years
before
but
had
returned
to
take
charge
of
the
grimleigh
remnant
he
was
well
acquainted
with
the
island
of
koiau
with
buli
the
high
chief
also
and
it
was
he
who
had
brought
home
tera
to
be
educated
in
england
a
religious
man
a
sympathetic
man
yet
a
guardian
whom
tera
feared
and
more
than
half
detested
as
she
looked
at
his
hairless
face
the
colour
of
old
ivory
the
minister
as
if
conscious
of
her
gaze
raised
his
eyes
a
look
passed
between
them
on
his
part
imploring
yet
withal
imperious
on
hers
defiant
with
a
touch
of
dread
and
in
that
look
intercepted
and
frowned
upon
by
the
vigilant
miss
arnott
lay
a
story
of
love
and
rejection
and
the
quondam
actress
shivered
as
her
heart
interpreted
its
meaning
after
an
hour
of
description
denunciation
and
imploring
appeals
on
behalf
of
the
poor
heathen
brand
prayed
long
and
fervently
for
the
conversion
of
tera
countrymen
then
he
gave
out
the
words
of
a
favourite
hymn
bearing
on
the
subject
of
his
discourse
which
was
sung
with
fervour
by
the
moved
congregation
the
music
following
so
closely
on
brand
discourse
of
her
homeland
was
too
much
for
tera
emotions
with
an
hysterical
sob
she
rose
hastily
and
passed
down
the
narrow
aisle
out
into
the
night
burning
gaze
followed
her
graceful
form
and
a
quiver
passed
over
his
face
like
a
breath
of
wind
on
still
waters
outside
the
night
was
warm
and
balmy
over
the
hills
at
the
back
of
bethgamul
rode
the
golden
wheel
of
the
harvest
moon
below
where
the
land
spread
at
the
foot
of
the
rise
tera
could
see
the
winking
lights
of
the
little
town
the
red
eye
of
the
lamp
at
the
end
of
the
jetty
and
extending
in
radiance
towards
a
darkening
horizon
the
silent
ocean
broken
here
and
there
by
the
fitful
moonlight
into
a
myriad
sparkles
somewhere
beyond
those
dark
clouds
lay
koiau
encircled
by
shining
waters
the
breeze
blowing
shoreward
seemed
almost
to
bear
with
it
the
spicy
perfumes
of
the
isle
strange
intoxicating
odours
which
maddened
her
for
home
on
the
beach
below
beat
the
surf
as
at
this
moment
it
beat
on
the
coral
reefs
beyond
the
lagoon
as
a
bird
her
soul
flew
on
the
wings
of
fancy
to
the
radiant
isle
of
her
birth
to
the
groves
and
banana
plantations
wild
music
wilder
dances
spaces
of
silver
sand
forests
glowing
with
tropical
blossom
the
dusky
women
twining
hibiscus
flowers
for
coronals
and
the
great
chiefs
holding
counsel
in
the
pure
house
of
the
gods
tera
dreamed
dreams
she
saw
visions
and
still
behind
her
drawled
and
droned
the
nasal
harmonies
of
those
colourless
worshippers
who
adored
an
unknown
god
suddenly
a
warm
clasp
was
laid
upon
her
wrist
and
tera
awoke
from
her
ecstasy
to
find
a
fair
saxon
face
close
to
her
own
with
a
quiet
little
sigh
of
pleasure
she
nestled
into
the
breast
of
the
man
jack
she
murmured
softly
fe
gwa
te
ofal
put
it
in
english
tera
said
jack
slipping
his
arm
round
the
girl
i
never
could
get
my
tongue
round
that
kanaka
lingo
she
hid
her
face
on
his
shoulder
with
a
blush
it
means
love
you
she
said
why
then
tera
kanaka
talk
is
very
good
talk
let
me
hear
more
of
it
but
not
here
the
piety
folk
will
soon
be
out
and
their
does
step
well
with
our
au√©
sighed
tera
christened
bithiah
they
make
me
dull
and
sad
these
songs
let
us
go
she
moved
along
the
brow
of
the
hill
leaning
on
the
sailor
arm
jack
finland

farmer
carwell
nephew
a
smart
alert
second
mate
on
board
a
coasting
tramp
he
should
have
shipped
on
a
better
boat
but
tera
lived
at
grimleigh
and
grimleigh
was
a
port
of
call
he
had
sailed
among
the
islands
of
eden
below
capricorn
he
knew
the
looks
of
a
coral
atoll
and
the
beauty
of
the
women
who
wandered
on
the
south
sea
beaches
after
a
prolonged
stay
in
the
islands
a
fit
of
had
brought
him
back
to
the
grimy
port
whence
he
had
set
sail
many
years
before
here
he
had
seen
tera
exiled
from
her
southern
paradise
and
here
with
the
impetuosity
of
a
sailor
he
had
declared
his
love
that
she
returned
it
was
natural
enough
for
jack
finland
was
as
splendid
a
young
man
as
ever
set
foot
ashore
to
beguile
the
hearts
of
maidens

inherent
love
for

beauty

jack
wisely
and

in
the
cold
before
tera
could
protest
that
she
would
be
nobody
wife
save
his
johnson
appeared
hurrying
towards
them
with
an
angry
look
on
his
face
in
the
silver
moonlight
he
could
see
the
lovers
plainly
and
their
attitude
sent
a
thrill
of
rage
through
his
heart
bithiah
he
said
harshly
this
is
not
an
hour
for
you
to
be
out
come
my
mother
is
waiting
for
us
tera
is
free
to
come
and
go
as
she
pleases
struck
in
finland
hotly
johnson
turned
on
him
with
restrained
passion
you
call
her
by
a
heathen
name
you
think
of
her
as
a
heathen
girl
oh
i
know
you
finland
you
finland
full
of
rage
at
the
contemptuous
word
would
have
struck
the
minister
but
tera
flung
herself
between
them
no
no
i
must
go
she
said
and
flung
a
last
word
and
look
at
jack
to√´
fua
farewell
said
she
and
walked
away
with
johnson
chapter
ii
pearls
of
price
tera
and
her
guardian
walked
home
in
silence
johnson
whose
love
for
the
girl
bordered
on
a
frenzy
could
not
as
yet
trust
himself
to
remark
on
her
conduct
in
meeting
finland
on
her
side
tera
having
for
johnson
something
of
the
awe
a
pupil
feels
for
his
schoolmaster
did
not
dare
to
bring
down
an
avalanche
of
anger
by
so
much
as
one
rash
word
but
this
attitude
was
as
may
be
guessed
the
calm
before
the
storm
when
tera
reached
the
house
she
would
have
gone
supperless
to
bed
if
only
to
avert
high
words
but
the
man
wrought
beyond
endurance
beckoned
her
into
his
study
and
there
the
storm
broke
as
violent
as
any
hurricane
of
the
girl
native
clime
this
can
not
go
on
said
johnson
striving
to
speak
calmly
you
must
see
for
yourself
this
can
not
go
on
the
girl
seated
in
a
chair
beyond
the
circle
of
light
thrown
by
the
said
nothing
with
clasped
hands
and
head
raised
like
a
serpent
crest
she
watched
her
guardian
striding
to
and
fro
vainly
trying
to
moderate
his
anger
so
had
she
seen
countrymen
of
her
own
fighting
the
primeval
elements
of
man
religion
civilization
the
restraint
learned
by
experience
all
were
gone
and
johnson
had
got
down
to
the
of
his
character
there
to
find
that
the
centre
of
his
being
like
that
of
the
earth
was
raging
fire
tormented
by
the
seven
devils
of
rejected
love
he
hardly
noticed
that
the
girl
made
no
comment
upon
his
despairing
outcry
that
you
a
baptized
christian
should
leave
the
temple
of
god
to
dally
with
a
profane
belial
he
raged
are
you
not
ashamed
to
have
converse
with
such
an
one

deceiver
a
lover

of

lies
which
i
do
not
believe
he

tall
and
beautiful
and
good
i
love
him
johnson
looked
as
though
he
could
have
struck
her
and
only
remembrance
of
his
calling
prevented
his
seizing
her
with
a
rough
grasp
however
he
restrained
himself
beat
down
his
anger
and
spoke
on
bithiah
said
he
in
a
quiet
voice
you
deceive
yourself
in
this
you
are
attracted
only
by
the
appearance
of
this
man
and
you
do
not
see
how
bad
how
cruel
he
is
i
should
be
false
to
my
trust
did
i
permit
you
to
become
his
wife
as
your
guardian
i
have
power
from
your
father
and
that
power
shall
be
exercised
for

good

forbid

and
set
her
mouth
firmly

i
shall
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
you

go

koiau
with

he
hesitated
it
will
be
a
happy
day
for
me
when
i
see
the
last
of
you
he
added
abruptly
tera
said
nothing
but
looking
on
his
white
face
smiled
with
a
little
ripple
of
laughter
the
man
chest
rose
and
fell
with
his
panting
for
the
hint
that
she
knew
all
and
scorned
all
touched
him
nearly
drawn
as
by
cords
he
stumbled
across
the
room
every
fibre
of
his
being
slack
and
weak
tera
he
muttered
faintly
dear
i
love
you
i
am
sorry
i
can
not
wait
wait
johnson
lightly
touched
her
arm
with
his
hot
hand
do
not
speak
hear
me
i
love
you
i
have
always
loved
you
i
always
shall
i
brought
you
here
in
the
hope
that
you
would
learn
to
love
me
my
passion
is
stronger
than
my
life
many
waters
can
not
quench
it
dear
i
am
but
a
man
as
other
men

months

fought
against
this
love
but
in
vain

heart

your
island

will
bring

countrymen

fold

the
good
shepherd

me
comfort
you
guide
you
lead
you
as
my
earthly
bride
to
the
foot
of
the
cross
see
see
i
am
no
stern
guardian
no
minister
of
the
gospel
but
a
man
a
man
whose
life
lies
in
your
hand
no
said
tera
firmly
although
his
passion
made
her
pity
him
my
heart
is
not
my
own
to
give
you
are
a
good
man
but
jack
you
you
love
him
then
with
all
my
soul
johnson
gave
an
hysterical
sob
this
also
is
a
sore
evil
he
quoted
under
his
breath
in
all
points
as
he
came
so
shall
he
go
may
i
leave
the
room
woman
he
seized
her
wrist
you
shall
love
me
no
you
are
a
snare
a
sorceress
you
have
beguiled
my
soul
to
its
undoing
i
was
happy
once
i
walked
in
pleasant
ways
but
you
have
turned
aside
my
feet
to
iniquity
god
help
me
how
can
i
preach
his
word
with
this
raging
fire
in
my
breast
you
shall
love
me
i
forbid
you
to
think
of
finland
you
are
mine
mine
mine
with
a
dexterous
twist
tera
released
her
hand
and
flew
out
of
the
room
closing
the
door
behind
her
johnson
started
in
headlong
pursuit
but
stumbling
blindly
against
the
door
struck
his
forehead
on
the
panels
and
fell
half
stunned
on
the
floor
there
he
lay
and
moaned
with
his
head
spinning
like
a
teetotum
until
the
sound
of
approaching
steps
made
him
rise
and
get
into
the
desk
chair
then
his
mother
a
commonplace
type
of
her
sex
much
occupied
with
domestic
affairs
entered
to
say
that
supper
was
ready
i
do
want
supper
thank
you
mother
said
the
minister
keeping
his
face
turned
away
that
she
might
not
see
the
swelling
on
his
forehead
have
it
yourself
and
go
to
bed
i
ca
find
bithiah
my
son
she
has
retired
mother
ah
the
old
woman
wagged
her
head
like
a
mandarin
she
is
no
doubt
meditating
on
the
beautiful
discourse
of
brother
korah
no
doubt
mother
please
go
away
i
am
busy
there
is
cold
meat
and
pickles
george
i
am
not
hungry
i
want
you
to
say
grace
johnson
laughed
bitterly
i
am
not
in
the
mood
to
say
grace
mother
the
old
lady
who
was
somewhat
querulous
lifted
up
her
voice
in
reproof
of
his
irreligious
speech
but
johnson
cut
her
short
and
persuaded
her
to
leave
the
room
then
he
looked
the
door
and
threw
himself
into
his
chair
with
a
groan
i
am
only
a
man
a
man
it
is
past
all
bearing
oh
what
a
life
what
a
life
no
money
no
love
and
a
faith
that
fails
me
at
need
yet
i
was
wrong
to
lose
my
temper
fool
wrath
is
presently
known
but
a
prudent
man
covereth
shame
the
minister
was
shaking
as
a
blown
reed
and
his
nerves
racked
him
with
pain
there
was
a
french
window
opening
on
to
a
plot
of
grass
and
this
he
flung
wide
to
the
night
air
but
the
calm
failed
to
soothe
him
although
he
walked
rapidly
up
and
down
the
sward
trying
to
forget
the
girl
he
had
done
all
he
could
he
could
do
no
more
bithiah
tera
he
cried
then
he
was
silent
he
the
room
and
sat
down
resolutely
at
his
desk
i
must
try
and
forget
her
said
he
work
work
anything
to
distract
my
mind
from
a
drawer
he
took
a
number
of
bills
and
with
these
many
unpleasant
letters
insisting
upon
payment
they
were
evidence
of
his
youthful
folly
at
college
before
he
had
been
called
to
grace
five
hundred
pounds
of
disgrace
and
which
had
hung
round
his
neck
these
many
years
some
he
had
paid
but
many
remained
unsettled
during
his
two
years
absence
in
the
south
seas
these
records
of
sin
as
he
regarded
them
had
never
troubled
him
but
since
his
return
to
grimleigh
his
creditors
had
found
him
out
and
were
persecuting
him
daily
he
was
threatened
with
imprisonment
with
bankruptcy
and
public
shame
he
a
minister
of
the
gospel
if
the
truth
became
known
he
would
lose
his
position
he
would
be
cast
without
employment
on
the
world
yet
how
to
conceal
his
difficulties
he
did
not
know
five
hundred
pounds
he
owed
and
his
stipend
was
two
hundred
a
year
if
the
pearls
were
only
mine
he
murmured
with
a
sigh
he
took
from
another
drawer
a
bag
of
chamois
leather
tied
at
the
neck
with
red
tape
opening
this
he
shook
out
on
the
a
number
of
smooth
shining
pearls
some
large
some
small
all
of
rare
colouring
and
great
value
these
belonged
to
tera
they
had
been
given
to
her
by
buli
before
she
left
koiau
for
the
purpose
of
buying
goods
and
clothes
to
take
back
when
she
returned
tera
as
yet
had
not
sold
them
and
for
safe
keeping
had
given
them
to
her
guardian
but
the
time
was
at
hand
when
she
would
go
back
to
koiau
with
brand
and
this
treasure
would
be
turned
into
money
and
exchanged
for
value
in
accordance
with
her
father
wish
three
thousand
pounds
worth
said
johnson
handling
the
glistening
gems
and
if
bithiah
married
me
the
money
would
be
mine
but
god
knows
i
do
not
care
for
these
things
tempting
as
they
are
it
is
she
alone
whom
i
desire
for
my
wife
though
to
gain
her
i
risk
the
pearl
of
great
price
for
a
man
soul
is
as
a
pearl
and
she
with
her
beauty
would
thieve
he
stopped
suddenly
for
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
heard
a
soft
and
stealthy
footstep
outside
cowardice
formed
no
part
of
the
young
character
and
hastily
replacing
the
pearls
in
the
bag
and
the
bag
in
the
drawer
he
crossed
the
room
and
stepped
out
of
the
window
to
right
and
left
of
him
he
looked
but
saw
nothing
overhead
shone
the
quiet
stars
underfoot
he
trod
the
dewy
sward
but
there
was
no
sign
of
any
human
being
yet
johnson
felt
convinced
that
some
eye
had
been
on
him
whilst
he
counted
the
pearls
and
he
felt
glad
that
he
had
locked
the
drawer
which
contained
them
to
verify
his
suspicions
he
stepped
through
the
iron
gate
and
walked
some
way
up
the
street
all
was
silent
under
the
glimmer
of
the
and
he
could
hear
only
the
echo
of
his
own
steps
hollow
on
the
asphalt
pavement
with
a
sigh
of
relief
half
convinced
that
his
ears
had
played
him
false
he
returned
to
the
house
and
his
study
there
was
no
doubt
that
some
one
had
been
at
the
desk
during
his
ten
minutes
absence
the
bills
were
gone
the
bills
were
gone
his
secret
was
in
the
keeping
of
some
other
person
who
had
done
this
why
had
he
been
watched
why
had
the
bills
of
all
things
been
taken
by
this
unknown
thief
the
minister
ran
wildly
out
again
into
the
darkness
he
hunted
up
and
down
the
street
he
looked
over
his
neighbours
fences
but
in
spite
of
the
closest
search
he
could
find
neither
the
bills
nor
the
person
who
had
taken
them
the
door
leading
from
the
study
to
the
interior
of
the
house
was
locked
no
one
could
have
entered
in
that
way
no
member
of
his
own
household
could
have
stolen
them
no
the
thief
must
have
come
in
by
the
window
during
his
absence
but
why
had
the
miscreant
taken
the
bills
and
not
the
pearls
an
examination
assured
him
that
these
were
safe
but
the
list
of
his
debts
his
name
his
honour
were
in
the
hands
of
some
person
unknown
it
is
some
horrible
dream
a
nightmare
gasped
the
unfortunate
man
oh
god
what
am
i
to
do
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
the
strictest
search
had
failed
to
find
the
thief
and
he
did
not
dare
to
summon
assistance
lest
his
dishonour
might
become
the
sooner
known
with
a
prayer
for
help
on
his
lips
he
locked
the
window
perplexed
and
anxious
he
retired
to
rest
but
not
to
his
room
fearful
lest
the
thief
should
return
he
lay
down
on
the
sofa
in
vain
were
all
efforts
to
sleep
and
he
passed
the
night
in
agony
until
dawn
burned
redly
along
the
ocean
line
then
he
rose
to
play
his
part
of
the
godly
young
minister
of
the
grimleigh
bethesda
with
the
passing
of
the
night
went
a
portion
of
johnson
terrors
and
he
was
fairly
composed
when
he
met
tera
at
the
beyond
a
conventional
greeting
he
said
nothing
but
during
the
absence
of
his
mother
from
the
room
he
raised
his
eyes
to
bespeak
the
attention
i
beg
your
pardon
for
speaking
as
i
did
last
night
he
said
coldly
i
lost
control
of
myself
say
nothing
more
johnson
cried
tera
i
understand
you
do
not
understand
anything
bithiah
i
write
to
brother
korah
asking
him
to
see
me
morning
at
ten
you
will
please
be
present
as
i
wish
to
give
into
his
charge
you
and
your
pearls
au√©
you
cast
me
off
i
can
no
longer
be
responsible
for
you
or
for
myself
i
love
you
but
your
heart
belongs
to
this
worldly
finland
i
shall
tell
all
to
brother
korah
and
he
shall
take
you
back
at
once
to
koiau
and
jack
faltered
tera
in
low
tones
you
shall
never
see
him
again
said
johnson
fiercely
in
your
own
despite
you
shall
be
saved
from
that
infidel
tera
looked
at
him
so
contemptuously
that
he
winced
dog
in
the
manger
said
she
insultingly
i
am
not
to
see
jack
because
i
refuse
to
love
you
well
we
shall
see
if
a
chief
daughter
is
to
be
your
slave
tofa
alii
farewell
chief
and
with
a
haughty
air
she
walked
out
of
the
room
it
might
have
been
that
johnson
would
have
followed
to
explain
his
meaning
more
clearly
and
even
to
defend
his
conduct
so
far
as
was
possible
had
not
his
mother
returned
just
at
that
moment
she
at
once
engaged
him
in
a
conversation
touching
the
delinquencies
of
their
a
mulish
creature
who
was
one
of
that
great
army
of
cooks
sent
by
the
devil
for
the
spoliation
of
god
food
the
man
intent
on
his
own
thoughts
listened
mechanically
and
seized
the
first
opportunity
to
get
away
that
same
morning
he
wrote
a
note
asking
brand
the
missionary
to
call
and
see
him
about
tera
and
so
with
iron
determination
committed
himself
to
a
separation
all
that
day
tera
pointedly
avoided
his
company
and
when
as
at
she
was
forced
to
be
in
it
was
content
to
express
herself
in
monosyllables
johnson
winced
and
paled
at
the
scorn
which
her
attitude
implied
but
bore
with
it
as
best
he
could
yet
his
thoughts
were
not
exclusively
taken
up
with
her
he
was
constantly
conjecturing
as
to
who
could
have
stolen
his
bills
and
he
tortured
himself
with
fears
lest
his
shame
would
speedily
be
made
known
in
grimleigh
the
strictest
examination
had
revealed
no
trace
of
the
thief
he
could
not
imagine
how
the
creature
had
accomplished
his
end
so
dexterously
he
was
silent
and
unhappy
the
year
was
drawing
to
and
the
golden
sunlight
lay
heavy
on
the
yellow
corn
lands
in
the
almost
tropical
heat
johnson
panted
and
quivered
for
his
jaded
nerves
and
body
could
not
resist
the
power
of
the
sun
towards
five
when
the
heat
had
somewhat
abated
and
the
cool
breathed
across
the
glowing
earth
he
went
into
the
town
to
see
some
members
of
his
congregation
his
work
he
sternly
resolved
should
not
be
neglected
for
his
private
troubles
so
he
visited
the
sick
succoured
the
needy
and
returned
somewhat
calm
to
his
home
as
he
entered
johnson
querulous
as
ever
met
him
where
is
bithiah
my
son
she
asked
complainingly
i
want
bithiah
to
help
me
prepare
the
supper
jane
is
worse
than
useless
i
have
not
seen
bithiah
mother
she
went
out
an
hour
ago
george
and
it
is
growing
dark
this
is
not
the
time
for
a
modest
maiden
to
be
out
and
jane
worries
me
she
has
used
up
all
the
milk
and
has
forgotten
to
order
the
meat
do
look
for
bithiah
very
well
mother
i
expect
she
is
taking
her
favourite
walk
by
farmer
carwell
meadows
i
must
just
see
if
there
are
any
letters
for
me
in
the
study
there
was
ample
light
in
the
room
when
he
entered
for
the
curtains
were
drawn
back
from
the
open
window
he
approached
the
desk
in
an
absent
frame
of
mind
but
suddenly
his
attention
was
fixed
by
an
amazing
circumstance
on
the
lay
the
pile
of
bills
which
had
been
stolen
from
him
on
the
previous
night
again
during
his
absence
the
thief
had
evidently
entered
the
plunder
was
restored
the
minister
shook
and
the
perspiration
beaded
his
brow
then
he
noticed
that
his
keys
which
he
had
left
behind
dangled
from
the
drawer
which
had
contained
the
pearls
gone
he
cried
wildly
the
pearls
are
gone
for
a
moment
he
stood
still
looking
at
the
returned
bills
the
empty
drawer
then
in
a
frenzy
of
fear
he
rushed
from
the
house
chapter
iii
a
disappointment
originally
korah
brand
had
been
a
sailor
careless
of
religion
and
content
to
live
for
the
day
without
taking
thought
of
the
morrow
born
in
england
trained
as
a
weaver
he
had
really
wandered
to
america
and
the
south
seas
at
the
dictation
of
a
restless
and
inquiring
spirit
in
those
unregenerate
days
he
had
been
a
law
unto
himself
and
thereby
sufficiently
but
the
chance
words
of
a
missionary
met
with
in
samoa
had
turned
his
thoughts
towards
religion
and
deserting
his
seafaring
life
he
henceforth
worked
as
a
labourer
in
the
lord
vineyard
yet
this
change
hardened
rather
than
softened
his
character
he
held
by
the
mosaic
law
and
interpreted
the
precepts
of
christ
in
a
spirit
of
narrow
bigotry
an
eye
for
an
eye
a
tooth
for
a
tooth
if
thy
right
hand
offend
thee
cut
it
off
these
were
the
fundamental
articles
of
his
creed
he
spoke
much
of
the
punishment
little
of
the
promise
and
daunted
the
minds
of
his
hearers
with
threats
of
eternal
doom
in
his
own
way
he
was
a
good
man
but
incapable
of
preaching
on
the
text
god
is
love
he
hardly
understood
that
these
three
words
form
the
true
basis
of
christianity
in
answer
to
johnson
urgent
letter
brand
presented
himself
next
morning
in
the
study
he
had
visited
it
several
times
before
yet
on
this
occasion
he
again
glanced
critically
round
him
as
if
in
search
of
some
indulgence
deserving
of
rebuke
but
the
room
and
its
contents
were
plain
even
poor
the
furniture
was
of
stained
deal
the
floor
was
covered
with
coarse
matting
brought
by
its
owner
from
koiau
there
were
savage
weapons
on
the
walls
between
the
bookcases
shells
of
strange
hue
and
form
ranged
on
the
mantelpiece
and
chintz
curtains
drawn
back
with
red
white
and
blue
cords
draped
the
one
window
on
these
last
brand
eyes
rested
with
disapprobation
the
lust
of
the
eye
is
there
brother
he
declared
to
the
pensive
johnson
why
do
you
deck
your
dwelling
with
purple
and
fine
linen
miss
arnott
gave
them
to
me
explained
johnson
lifting
his
heavy
eyes
she
thought
the
room
looked
bare
and
draped
the
window
herself
the
curtains
are
only
of
chintz
brother
brand
although
the
cords
are
of
silk
they
can
scarcely
do
harm
admit
god
light
into
your
tabernacle
let
not
your
heart
be
led
astray
by
the
gifts
of
a
light
woman
though
he
felt
sick
in
mind
and
body
johnson
could
not
let
this
remark
pass
without
a
protest
miss
arnott
is
one
of
our
most
devoted
sisters
said
he
stiffly
she
was
once
in
the
bonds
of
sin
as
a
singing
woman
but
she
gave
up
the
allurements
of
the
world
to
serve
humbly
in
our
zion
the
old
leaven
is
still
in
her
brother
such
gay
adornments
savour
of
the
world
let
me
say
a
word
in
season
this
is
not
the
season
for
words
interrupted
johnson
impatiently
i
have
to
speak
with
you
on
other
and
more
important
matters
nothing
is
more
important
than
a
man
soul
rebuked
korah
shaking
his
shaggy
head
but
i
suppose
you
desire
to
talk
of
the
maiden
bithiah
yes
i
want
you
to
take
her
away
to
koiau
as
soon
as
possible
but
i
fear
that
you
will
not
be
able
to
do
so
johnson
rose
and
paced
the
room
she
has
disappeared
he
said
in
a
low
voice
disappeared
repeated
brand
harshly
what
do
you
mean
brother
have
you
lost
the
precious
pearl
entrusted
to
your
charge
tera
is
lost
i
admit
she
not
tera
friend
we
know
her
as
bithiah
bithiah
is
lost
repeated
the
minister
patiently
she
left
my
house
last
evening
shortly
after
four
and
has
not
returned
i
fear
he
added
that
she
has
taken
her
pearls
with
her
what
pearls
brother
what
pearls
pearls
worth
three
thousand
pounds
which
buli
gave
her
to
sell
here
before
she
returned
to
koiau
she
wished
to
keep
them
until
the
time
of
her
return
and
gave
them
into
my
keeping
in
this
drawer
said
johnson
touching
the
desk
i
locked
them
up
when
i
returned
yesterday
evening
the
pearls
were
gone
bithiah
also
it
will
be
perceived
that
johnson
omitted
to
explain
the
loss
and
return
of
the
bills
this
he
did
for
two
reasons
firstly
his
private
affairs
were
his
own
concern
secondly
to
take
brand
into
his
confidence
would
result
only
in
a
lecture
korah
however
found
in
the
disappearance
of
tera
and
her
pearls
quite
sufficient
matter
for
anger
it
was
serious
that
an
influential
convert
and
a
comparatively
large
fortune
should
be
lost
to
the
sect
of
which
he
was
a
member
at
first
he
was
inclined
to
speak
severely
but
a
momentary
reflection
convinced
him
that
it
would
be
wiser
first
to
examine
johnson
with
a
view
to
reaching
the
root
of
the
matter
brand
was
not
without
diplomatic
gifts
if
you
please
said
he
dryly
we
will
approach
this
matter
with
more
particularity
how
do
you
know
that
bithiah
has
gone
away
how
do
i
know
echoed
the
minister
with
surprise
on
his
haggard
face
why
she
has
not
been
home
all
night
moreover
we
had
a
few
words
about
what
johnson
hesitated
it
was
unpleasant
to
tell
this
unsympathetic
zealot
the
story
of
his
love
but
for
the
sake
of
gaining
help
it
seemed
inevitable
still
he
temporized
so
that
courage
to
speak
boldly
might
come
to
him
in
the
interval
about
a
man
called
finland
said
he
jack
finland
the
sailor
brother
carwell
nephew
oh
you
know
him
i
know
of
him
and
no
good
either
he
was
in
the
south
seas
some
few
months
back
and
bore
no
very
good
character
so
far
as
the
low
moral
standard
of
goes
he
is
right
enough
but
he
is
not
a
christian
he
is
steeped
in
vanity
one
of
those
who
grin
like
a
dog
and
run
about
the
city
what
is
bithiah
to
him
she
is
in
love
with
him
wait
do
speak
since
this
sister
returned
to
grimleigh
he
has
followed
her
constantly
with
the
low
sensual
passion
which
he
miscalls
love
the
other
night
after
your
lecture
she
left
our
bethgamul
to
meet
him
i
found
them
together
and
she
she
declared
her
love
cried
johnson
with
sudden
passion
she
said
it
was
her
intention
to
marry
him
to
marry
that
son
of
belial
lost
and
iniquitous
as
he
is
i
took
her
away
from
his
sinful
company
and
brought
her
home
into
this
very
room
and
then
demanded
korah
with
his
eyes
on
the
quivering
white
face
then
i
reproved
her
for
consorting
with
sinners
i
told
her
of
my
love
oh
said
korah
very
dryly
then
it
was
jealousy
and
not
pure
christianity
which
urged
you
to
save
her
call
it
what
you
like
brand
i
loved
her
and
i
told
her
of
my
love
i
asked
her
to
be
my
wife
i
promised
to
take
her
back
to
the
islands
that
we
might
work
together
in
the
vineyard
she
refused
she
was
right
to
refuse
how
dare
you
mingle
sacred
and
profane
love
i
am
but
a
man
replied
johnson
sullenly
and
as
a
man
i
feel
what
harm
was
there
in
telling
her
that
i
wished
to
make
her
my
wife
i
am
a
minister
a
follower
of
christ
is
it
not
better
that
she
should
marry
me
rather
than
finland
the
infidel
you
knew
that
i
was
about
to
take
her
back
brother
you
might
also
have
guessed
that
buli
had
other
views
for
her
future
he
has
this
girl
shall
marry
neither
you
nor
finland
but
all
you
say
in
no
way
explains
her
disappearance
i
think
it
does
brand
i
told
her
that
she
must
never
see
this
sailor
again
and
i
believe
that
she
has
gone
that
she
may
free
herself
from
the
prohibition
do
you
think
that
she
has
gone
away
with
finland
if
she
went
with
him
they
are
not
together
now
early
this
morning
i
saw
him
in
the
high
street
but
i
was
not
able
to
speak
to
him
it
struck
me
that
bithiah
might
have
sought
out
shackel
shackel
who
is
he
jacob
shackel
explained
the
minister
the
captain
of
the
boat
we
came
home
in
he
is
a
godless
creature
but
tera
i
mean
bithiah
was
drawn
to
him
and
she
promised
to
visit
him
in
london
where
does
he
live
brother
somewhere
near
the
docks
i
believe
he
gave
bithiah
his
address
oh
i
am
sure
she
has
gone
to
him
so
that
he
may
take
her
back
to
koiau
on
his
next
voyage
is
he
in
london
now
yes
bithiah
received
a
letter
from
him
only
last
week
he
will
help
her
to
go
away
as
he
has
no
love
for
us
brother
korah
a
mocker
said
brand
sadly
bithiah
can
not
go
away
she
has
no
money
she
has
the
pearls
and
they
are
worth
three
thousand
pounds
at
least
how
do
you
know
that
she
took
them
i
am
certain
she
took
them
said
johnson
emphatically
although
i
have
only
circumstantial
evidence
to
go
on
bithiah
was
the
only
person
who
knew
that
they
were
locked
in
this
drawer
unfortunately
i
left
my
keys
behind
me
when
i
went
out
visiting
yesterday
so
it
was
easy
for
her
to
take
them
away
korah
frowned
and
combed
his
beard
with
his
fingers
so
far
as
i
can
judge
from
your
story
said
he
rebukingly
this
maiden
has
departed
to
avoid
your
love
say
rather
because
i
wished
to
keep
her
from
finland
well
i
will
see
finland
brother
if
he
knows
where
bithiah
is
she
shall
be
brought
back
but
not
to
you
i
myself
will
take
her
to
koiau
and
deliver
her
to
her
father
you
take
no
account
of
my
feelings
said
johnson
bitterly
the
lord
work
can
not
be
hindered
for
your
earthly
passion
if
buli
knew
that
you
wished
to
take
his
child
from
him
he
would
not
protect
our
missionaries
and
the
good
seed
would
be
sown
in
barren
ground
but
we
can
speak
of
these
things
later
brother
johnson
the
first
thing
to
do
is
to
rescue
the
maiden
from
the
consequences
of
her
foolish
flight
i
will
question
finland
and
you
i
am
going
up
to
london
by
the
train
to
see
captain
shackel
why
not
write
or
telegraph
suggested
korah
i
think
it
best
to
be
on
the
spot
myself
brother
the
missionary
nodded
and
rose
to
leave
the
room
at
the
door
he
paused
and
looked
at
johnson
keenly
from
under
his
shaggy
brows
brother
said
he
in
a
deep
and
solemn
voice
your
feet
are
straying
from
the
narrow
path
you
love
this
maiden
entrusted
to
your
care
and
weary
after
the
pearls
no
no
i
do
not
what
do
i
want
with
the
pearls
brother
brand
shook
a
menacing
finger
it
is
known
that
you
owe
money
with
those
pearls
you
would
pay
the
price
of
your
follies
how
do
you
know
that
i
owe
money
asked
johnson
pale
to
the
lips
your
handmaiden
found
a
letter
swept
aside
it
was
from
a
tailor
requesting
from
you
payment
of
eighty
pounds
due
to
him
what
have
you
to
do
with
the
vanity
of
dyed
garments
from
bozrah
my
private
affairs
are
my
own
mr
brand
cried
johnson
with
spirit
i
allow
no
man
to
discuss
them
in
my
presence
brother
brother
your
feet
go
downwards
to
the
pit
a
wastrel
a
lover
of
vanities
how
can
you
be
the
pastor
of
our
bethesda
take
heed
lest
you
stumble
for
soon
the
eyes
of
all
shall
be
open
to
your
iniquity
as
the
missionary
departed
he
cast
a
look
over
his
shoulder
and
saw
the
unhappy
minister
sink
back
in
his
chair
with
a
look
of
pain
but
brand
in
his
pharisaical
uprightness
had
no
pity
for
the
man
or
for
his
position
as
he
has
sown
so
shall
he
reap
muttered
he
and
dismissed
the
matter
from
his
mind
he
quite
forgot
that
other
text
bear
ye
one
another
burdens
yet
had
he
remembered
he
would
have
misapplied
it
as
he
did
all
other
sayings
of
the
christ
whom
he
professed
to
follow
in
the
meantime
he
searched
for
finland
and
found
him
on
the
stone
jetty
smoking
and
jesting
with
some
fishermen
when
brand
appeared
the
young
sailor
turned
his
back
on
him
for
he
had
no
love
for
a
missionary
but
korah
who
had
the
pertinacity
of
a
fanatic
was
not
to
be
put
off
so
easily
john
finland
come
with
me
i
have
need
of
you
need
have
to
be
your
master
then
sneered
jack
i
more
to
do
than
gavort
round
with
critters
brand
seized
the
young
man
shoulders
with
a
grasp
like
a
pair
of
pincers
it
is
about
bithiah
he
said
sourly
i
do
know
any
girl
of
that
name
she
was
tera
when
in
the
bonds
of
sin
tera
jack
led
the
missionary
aside
and
looked
at
him
with
a
frown
on
his
handsome
face
and
what
may
you
have
to
say
about
tera
mister
missionary
where
is
she
john
finland
how
should
i
know
i
am
not
her
keeper
so
answered
cain
when
he
destroyed
his
brother
body
but
you
john
finland
shall
not
evade
my
inquiry
about
the
destruction
of
a
human
soul
tera
as
you
call
her
is
gone
and
you
have
taken
her
from
the
fold
tera
gone
finland
paled
through
his
bronzed
complexion
where
has
she
gone
i
ask
that
said
brand
sternly
last
night
she
left
the
fold
at
six
and
has
not
returned
she
went
to
you
bearing
precious
jewels
i
never
saw
her
i
swear
last
time
i
met
her
was
the
evening
before
yesterday
when
johnson
took
her
away
this
comes
of
her
being
amongst
your
lot
you
have
made
away
with
tera
for
the
sake
of
her
pearls
finland
was
desperately
in
earnest
for
he
clenched
his
fists
spoke
hoarsely
and
looked
wicked
brand
was
sufficiently
a
judge
of
human
nature
to
see
that
this
speech
was
made
in
all
honesty
whosoever
knew
where
tera
had
gone
jack
was
not
the
man
he
was
as
astonished
at
her
disappearance
as
brand
himself
i
see
you
are
ignorant
of
her
whereabouts
he
said
in
a
disappointed
tone
we
must
seek
elsewhere
for
bithiah
oh
i
seek
for
her
i
find
her
said
jack
between
his
teeth
and
if
any
harm
has
come
to
her
i
wring
that
parson
neck
i
know
him
he
loves
tera
and
i
should
be
surprised
if
he
has
carried
her
off
but
i
find
her
if
she
is
above
ground
above
ground
echoed
brand
you
you
do
think
the
girl
is
dead
chapter
iv
in
the
cornfield
the
little
town
of
grimleigh
opened
full
on
to
the
channel
its
extension
had
of
necessity
been
lateral
by
reason
of
the
hills
which
in
the
rear
rose
so
precipitously
as
to
be
hopelessly
inaccessible
to
the
builder
but
at
either
extremity
the
gradient
became
easier
and
here
row
upon
row
of
houses
sloped
down
towards
a
lower
plane
built
up
of
silt
this
too
was
well
covered
though
here
again
nature
had
intervened
and
the
builder
had
perforce
to
stay

hand

by
the

a
narrow
stone
jetty
ran
out
abruptly
into
the
harbour
which
sheltered
as
it
was
by
the
high
land
around
afforded
secure
haven
for
those
fishers
of
the
deep
upon
whom
in
a
large
degree
grimleigh
depended
for
its
prosperity
as
you
drew
from
the
sea
the
precipitous
nature
of
the
land
ceased
and
far
into
the
hazy
distance
the
undulating
down
now
waved
with
the
ripening
corn
the
homesteads
scattered
here
and
there
seemed
almost
buried
in
the
golden
billows
the
distinction
too
between
the
land
and
sea
folk
was
sharply
marked
the
one
rarely
mingled
with
the
other
when
grimleigh
folk
left
grimleigh
it
was
mostly
for
the
sea
while
poldew
the
some
ten
miles
further
inland
was
the
invariable
goal
of
farmer
and
farm
labourer
carwell
owned
the
farm
nearest
to
grimleigh
it
stretched
directly
from
the
ridge
where
the
hills
sloped
beachwards
a
broad
highway
running
through
the
lifted
itself
over
the
rise
and
dropped
gradually
down
until
it
ran
into
the
high
street
bisecting
the
silt
besides
this
main
approach
the
place
was
rich
in
paths
which
ran
round
the
meadows
these

grimleigh
folk
put
to
the
fullest
possible
use
both
economic
and
romantic
a
month
after
the
disappearance
of
tera
two
figures
might
have
been
seen
climbing
one
of
these
paths
the
one
was
herbert
mayne
a
smart
yeoman
squire
of
handsome
countenance
and
somewhat
fickle
disposition
the
other
rachel
carwell
to
whom
for
some
time
past
the
young
man
had
attached
himself
rachel
was
small
and
rather
pale
but
you
would
not
have
denied
her
prettiness
her
brown
curling
hair
and
a
neat
figure
and
large
blue
eyes
were
attractions
quite
strong
enough
for
the
inflammable
herbert
to
lose
his
head
over
in
spite
of
her
modest
garb
and
close
bonnet
rachel
knew
very
well
that
she
was
pretty
she
in
nowise
resented
herbert
attentions
for
he
was
and
of
a
good
yeoman
family
her
father
she
knew
would
approve
of
such
a
match
and
as
her
own
inclinations
leaned
towards
it
she
grudged
herbert
neither
her
company
nor
her
conversation
it
is
true
that
he
had
been
wild
that
there
were
many
tales
current
in
the
district
about
his
attentions
to
other
girls
and
that
it
was
reported
that
he
had
once
been
in
love
with
a
gipsy
girl
but
rachel
looked
upon
all
these
things
as
follies
of
the
past
herbert
was
now
a
reformed
character
he
went
to
chapel
he
attended
to
his
farm
and
he
cast
no
glance
at
another
woman
while
rachel
was
by
and
although
he
had
said
no
word
of
love
to
her
she
quite
looked
on
him
as
her
future
husband
she
was
prepared
to
become
mayne
whenever
he
should
propose
to
raise
her
to
that
dignity
there
was
no
romance
about
rachel
or
her
courting
all
was
dull
and
respectable
with
just
an
element
of
religion
thrown
in
to
render
her
position
irreproachable
when
the
pair
reached
the
brow
of
the
hill
they
cast
one
glance
at
a
distant
field
where
farmer
carwell
was
cutting
and
binding
his
corn
then
turned
to
look
back
on
grimleigh
and
the
distant
ocean
sparkling
in
the
strong
sunshine
rachel
had
taken
herbert
arm
to
climb
the
hill
and
she
still
leaned
on
it
with
girlish
confidence
in
its
strong
support
after
a
time
they
sat
down
on
a
convenient
seat
and
rachel
feeling
hot
took
off
her
close
linen
bonnet
her
hair
was
very
beautiful
what
lovely
curls
you
have
said
herbert
admiringly
it
seems
a
shame
to
hide
them
rachel
laughed
and
blushed
not
ill
pleased
when
was
a
woman
impervious
to
flattery
it
is
not
right
that
one
of
our
congregation
should
give
way
to
the
vanities
of
this
world
she
said
demurely
i
should
put
on
my
bonnet
again
since
my
hair
attracts
your
attention
no
do
rachel
i
like
to
see
a
woman
make
herself
look
as
pretty
as
she
can
vanity
and
vexation
of
spirit
herbert
nonsense
i
think
our
people
are
far
too
severe
would
you
like
to
wear
dresses
of
a
pretty
colour
and
a
gold
brooch
and
a
hat
with
flowers
in
it
what
is
the
use
of
thinking
of
such
things
said
rachel
rather
pettishly
for
she
had
the
true
feminine
instinct
for
fashion
and
colour
father
would
never
let
me
dress
gaily
besides
think
of
the
scandal
there
would
be
if
i
appeared
in
bethgamul
as
you
describe
that
native
girl
tera
was
gaily
enough
dressed
rachel
and
no
one
said
anything
in
rebuke
to
her
you
mean
bithiah
corrected
rachel
primly
do
call
her
by
the
name
her
heathen
father
gave
her
you
forget
bithiah
was
a
daughter
not
an
english
girl
johnson
said
that
her
father
wished
her
to
be
dressed
like
a
parrot
after
all
bithiah
was
only
a
poor
heathen
tera
was
but
bithiah
believed
and
was
baptized
like
a
good
christian
it
did
not
do
her
much
good
then
said
rachel
with
jealousy
seeing
that
she
ran
away
from
our
good
minister
they
will
never
find
her
again
never
said
herbert
confidently
she
has
vanished
as
completely
as
though
the
earth
had
swallowed
her
up
johnson
thought
that
she
might
have
gone
to
london
indeed
he
went
there
to
search
for
her
why
to
london
oh
it
seems
that
the
captain
of
the
ship
she
came
to
england
in
lives
in
london
a
man
called
jacob
shackel
to
whom
johnson
thought
she
might
have
gone
but
shackel
knew
nothing
about
her
and
johnson
came
home
in
despair
i
often
wonder
why
she
ran
away
i
do
said
miss
carwell
shrewdly
everybody
is
making
mystery
out
of
her
disappearance
but
i
ca
see
it
myself
she
was
in
love
with
my
wicked
cousin
jack
and
ran
away
with
him
you
are
wrong
rachel
mr
brand
the
missionary
asked
jack
about
that
and
he
denied
it
besides
jack
was
almost
mad
with
grief
when
he
heard
the
girl
was
lost
and
hunted
for
her
everywhere
there
a
hole
or
corner
in
the
country
where
he
has
not
been
to
search
for
her
oh
jack
is
very
wicked
and
very
clever
said
rachel
with
a
toss
of
her
head
he
never
comes
to
chapel
and
was
always
a
scoffer
at
godly
things
he
bowed
down
to
that
girl
as
though
she
were
one
of
her
own
idols
jack
has
been
gone
from
grimleigh
these
two
weeks
i
believe
bithiah
ran
away
first
and
he
joined
her
bithiah
indeed
this
with
a
more
vigorous
toss
of
the
head
she
has
forfeited
all
right
to
that
name
by
her
conduct
i
shall
call
her
tera
well
jack
believe
me
jack
and
tera
wherever
they
are
are
together
but
rachel
jack
left
here
to
join
his
ship
in
london
so
he
says
but
i
do
believe
him
jack
never
did
have
any
regard
for
the
truth
no
he
has
joined
bithiah
else
why
did
she
take
her
pearls
with
her
this
reasoning
was
so
purely
feminine
that
herbert
could
neither
follow
nor
answer
it
he
was
a
friend
of
finland
and
had
received
from
him
so
solemn
an
assurance
about
his
ignorance
of
whereabouts
that
he
did
not
for
one
moment
believe
that
the
lovers
were
together
moreover
before
jack
had
left
for
london
he
had
asked
mayne
to
watch
johnson
so
as
to
discover
if
possible
if
the
minister
were
in
anyway
concerned
in
his
ward
disappearance
in
pursuance
of
his
promise
herbert
had
made
many
inquiries
about
johnson
and
had
learned
much
concerning
him
which
he
now
imparted
to
rachel
do
you
know
that
our
pastor
is
in
debt
he
asked
with
a
certain
amount
of
hesitation
what
johnson
in
debt
gasped
rachel
brokenly
i
believe
it
no
i
ca
why
he
lives
like
a
pauper
at
least
well
within
his
income
he
is
hard
up
for
all
that
rachel
while
at
college
he
contracted
certain
debts
and
these
are
not
yet
paid
now
he
is
suffering
for
the
sins
of
his
youth
rachel
who
was
a
fervent
admirer
of
the
minister
jumped
up
and
began
to
walk
towards
the
distant
cornfield
she
seemed
very
angry
i
would
not
talk
of
youthful
sins
if
i
were
you
she
said
tartly
to
the
astonished
herbert
as
he
regained
his
place
by
her
side
you
are
not
so
good
yourself
or
were
not
till
lately
i
never
pretended
to
be
a
saint
rachel
no
man
is
that
i
know
of
not
even
our
precious
pastor
in
spite
of
what
they
say
he
was
in
love
with
bithiah
himself
i
know
that
retorted
miss
carwell
unexpectedly
i
have
seen
him
looking
at
her
in
chapel
do
you
think
i
have
no
eyes
in
my
head
of
course
johnson
loved
her
and
a
very
lucky
girl
she
was
to
gain
the
affection
of
such
a
man
but
that
her
heart
was
set
on
worldly
things
she
would
have
remained
here
and
married
our
pastor
instead
of
running
away
with
that
wicked
cousin
of
mine
but
these
debts
herbert
who
told
you
about
them
i
heard
of
them
from
several
people
but
the
main
source
is
through
johnson
servant
who
found
one
or
two
of
the
letters
asking
for
payment
and
read
them
oh
herbert
poor
johnson
will
be
called
to
account
by
the
elders
for
this
they
think
it
is
a
dire
sin
to
owe
money
no
doubt
and
he
will
probably
be
asked
to
resign
the
pastorate
of
our
bethgamul
but
now
do
you
say
a
word
against
him
interrupted
rachel
with
crimson
cheeks
or
i
shall
go
away
rachel
you
are
not
in
love
with
him
i
hope
no
mayne
i
am
not
how
dare
you
say
such
a
thing
to
me
i
am
in
love
with
no
one
at
present
not
with
anyone
whispered
mayne
looking
directly
at
her
i
refuse
to
answer
questions
which
you
have
not
the
right
to
ask
by
her
reply
rachel
hinted
very
plainly
that
herbert
could
easily
become
possessed
of
that
right
by
the
simple
procedure
of
a
proposal
she
quite
expected
him
to
do
so
seeing
that
she
had
thus
met
him
but
to
her
surprise
and
secret
anger
he
appeared
in
no
way
anxious
to
avail
himself
of
the
opportunity
making
no
reply
he
walked
on
gloomily
beside
her
silent
and
ill
pleased
this
behaviour
both
piqued
and
frightened
her
so
determined
not
to
say
the
first
word
in
reconciliation
of
their
tiff
she
too
held
her
tongue
and
so
they
walked
on
by
this
time
they
had
arrived
nearly
at
the
cornfield
where
the
harvesting
was
going
on
under
the
personal
supervision
of
farmer
carwell
the
sturdy
old
man
was
no
convert
to
the
use
of
steam
and
his
corn
was
reaped
with
sickle
and
scythe
in
the
style
of
his
forefathers
a
long
line
of
men
whose
bodies
rose
and
fell
in
rhythmic
movement
swept
the
glittering
blades
through
the
thick
standing
grain
at
their
heels
scrambled
a
crowd
of
women
and
boys
binding
the
swathes
into
sheaves
after
them
came
the
gleaners
picking
up
what
was
left
the
sun
flamed
hotly
in
a
cloudless
sky
of
soft
blue
and
the
yellow
plain
glowed
like
a
furnace
carwell
with
his
coat
off
was
directing
operations
and
only
desisted
from
shouting
and
working
when
he
saw
his
daughter
approach
with
the
silent
herbert
at
her
heels
hey
lass
you
are
just
in
time
to
give
us
a
hand
said
he
wiping
the
perspiration
from
off
his
brow
and
you
too
mayne
but
maybe
you
are
too
much
taken
up
with
your
own
crops
to
lend
a
hand
with
mine
oh
i
help
said
herbert
slipping
off
his
coat
i
just
came
up
with
rachel
here
although
by
rights
i
should
be
back
at
the
farm
i
sorry
you
troubled
to
come
with
me
mayne
replied
rachel
not
well
pleased
at
this
ungallant
speech
but
we
wo
detain
you
here
please
go
back
to
your
own
land
nay
nay
cried
her
father
let
the
lad
have
a
glass
of
beer
and
give
us
a
hand
if
he
will
we
need
all
the
help
we
can
get
for
i
should
be
surprised
if
we
have
a
deal
of
rain
before
the
end
of
the
week
the
weather
looks
set
enough
now
said
herbert
picking
up
a
scythe
phew
it
as
hot
as
the
tropics
well
i
mow
rachel
will
you
be
my
ruth
and
glean
after
me
rachel
tossed
her
head
indeed
i
will
not
mr
mayne
it
was
a
few
minutes
ago
hinted
the
young
man
dropping
his
voice
ah
you
were
good
then
just
now
i
am
not
pleased
with
you
it
was
on
herbert
lips
to
ask
her
the
reason
when
a
commotion
was
seen
to
take
place
amongst
the
harvesters
excited
voices
were
raised
two
or
three
men
stepped
into
the
standing
corn
and
all
threw
down
their
hooks
hullo
hullo
cried
the
farmer
striding
towards
them
what
all
this
the
answer
he
received
startled
him
a
woman
shrieked
and
then
several
of
them
came
tearing
past
and
rachel
looked
at
mayne
what
what
is
it
she
gasped
but
without
reply
herbert
rushed
on
towards
the
disordered
group
what
is
the
matter
roared
carwell
parting
the
crowd
right
and
left
what
are
ye
then
his
eye
caught
sight
of
a
dark
object
lying
in
the
middle
of
the
corn
and
he
recoiled
a
body
he
exclaimed
in
horrified
tone
god
help
us
the
body
of
a
lass
it
was
indeed
the
body
of
a
woman
the
harvesters
examined
it
but
they
could
not
recognize
the
face
it
had
evidently
lain
there
several
weeks
among
the
standing
corn
recognition
of
its
identity
was
impossible
indeed
rain
and
sun
and
wind
had
combined
to
blot
out
all
semblance
to
humanity
but
the
dress
showed
these
were
the
remains
of
a
woman
there
was
something
very
pitiful
in
this
poor
clay
lying
there
in
the
sunshine
strangled
muttered
carwell
bending
over
it
there
is
a
cord
round
the
throat
send
the
women
away
he
shouted
this
is
no
sight
for
them
poor
lass
dead
and
in
my
field
i
wonder
who
she
was
keep
back
rachel
he
added
as
his
daughter
attracted
by
the
news
came
swiftly
up
but
rachel
did
not
pause
she
had
caught
sight
of
the
dead
dress
and
brushed
past
her
father
bithiah
she
cried
it
is
bithiah
tera
johnson
ward
chapter
v
a
nine
days
wonder
in
a
surprisingly
short
space
of
time
the
news
was
in
every
mouth
it
drew
the
idlers
of
grimleigh
to
the
meadow
where
the
corpse
still
lay
amongst
the
standing
corn
but
the
police
having
received
early
notice
were
quickly
on
the
spot
and
drew
a
cordon
round
the
poor
remains
that
they
might
in
no
way
be
molested
beyond
this
the
crowd
of
fishers
and
labourers
broke
into
excited
groups
arguing
and
theorizing
i
smelt
said
a
reaper
eh
i
smelt
is
a
very
bad
smell
sure
is
wonder
mun
was
not
found
afore
william
lee
you
be
a
fule
george
evans
the
poor
lass
was
bedded
out
in
the
middle
of
the
field
wi
the
corn
thick
about
her
nor
smell
nor
sight
could
come
to
sich
as
passed
on
the
road
but
the
maiden
must
ha
bin
dragged
the
and
so
they
bin
beat
down
now
if
one
saw
sich
they
would
think
was
the
rain
or
god
almighty
wind
george
evans
eh
and
who
would
look
for
mun
in
a
cornfield
he
who
killed
yon
maiden
was
cliver
for
sure
and
who
did
that
william
lee
no
one
was
sufficiently
speculative
or
daring
to
answer
this
question
eyes
looked
into
eyes
heads
were
shaken
at
heads
but
the
labourers
could
guess
neither
by
whom
nor
for
what
reason
the
girl
had
been
killed
mayne
alone
made
an
attempt
to
solve
the
mystery
as
he
escorted
rachel
to
her
home
i
wonder
what
johnson
knows
of
this
said
he
suddenly
rachel
looked
at
him
in
surprise
i
do
see
what
he
can
know
of
it
herbert
the
poor
girl
left
his
house
while
he
was
out
quite
so
but
he
followed
her
how
do
you
know
i
was
coming
up
from
grimleigh
on
the
night
bithiah
disappeared
as
i
climbed
that
path
which
goes
to
the
field
i
met
our
pastor
coming
from
it
he
looked
and
tore
past
me
like
a
i
did
not
know
then
what
he
was
after
now
i
make
sure
he
was
in
search
of
bithiah
not
to
kill
her
herbert
cried
rachel
shuddering
not
to
kill
her
no
i
do
say
that
rachel
he
had
no
reason
to
kill
her
you
know
he
loved
her
a
man
does
not
kill
the
woman
he
loves
a
minister
set
high
as
an
example
to
the
congregation
does
not
break
the
sixth
commandment
rachel
turned
on
mayne
with
a
look
of
wrath
in
her
usually
mild
eyes
herbert
mayne
for
shame
she
cried
furiously
shame
upon
you
that
you
say
such
things
i
would
as
soon
believe
my
own
father
killed
tera
as
mr
johnson
i
do
want
to
accuse
the
pastor
said
herbert
gloomily
but
if
he
does
not
know
how
she
came
by
her
death
who
does
i
believe
that
bithiah
or
tera
as
i
should
call
her
carried
away
her
pearls
on
that
night
and
was
killed
by
some
tramp
who
wished
to
rob
her
how
would
a
tramp
know
that
bithiah
carried
three
thousand
pounds
worth
of
pearls
retorted
herbert
sharply
your
statement
only
strengthens
the
case
against
johnson
he
alone
knew
that
bithiah
had
the
pearls
with
her
he
a
case
against
mr
johnson
interrupted
rachel
there
is
no
case
against
him
how
dare
you
talk
like
this
it
is
merely
a
theory
it
is
envy
and
hatred
herbert
mayne
here
i
am
at
home
i
shall
not
ask
you
to
come
in
you
have
spoken
too
cruelly
of
our
pastor
go
away
and
ask
god
for
a
new
heart
a
contrite
spirit
i
am
ashamed
of
you
rachel
entered
the
house
and
closed
the
door
in
herbert
face
he
stood
where
he
was
for
a
moment
then
he
turned
and
walked
back
to
the
field
in
spite
of
miss
carwell
denunciation
he
bore
no
ill
will
towards
the
minister
he
only
theorized
on
the
sole
evidence
which
he
possessed
johnson
loved
tera
and
she
loved
finland
johnson
was
in
desperate
need
of
money
and
tera
had
run
away
and
on
the
very
night
of
her
departure
he
had
met
johnson
on
the
path
near
the
very
cornfield
in
which
the
body
had
been
found
the
evidence
circumstantial
if
it
was
clearly
pointed
to
johnson
being
more
or
less
implicated
i
do
say
that
he
either
stole
the
pearls
or
killed
the
girl
mused
herbert
as
he
strode
along
i
merely
think
he
must
in
some
way
be
connected
with
the
matter
or
at
least
know
something
about
it
at
all
events
it
will
be
for
him
to
explain
how
he
came
to
be
in
that
particular
place
on
that
particular
night
sooner
or
later
the
police
are
bound
to
question
him
when
he
reached
the
field
herbert
found
that
inspector
chard
had
arrived
from
poldew
by
his
directions
the
body
of
tera
was
carried
into
grimleigh
and
there
laid
out
in
an
empty
building
close
to
the
notified
that
the
dead
woman
was
johnson
ward
mr
inspector
after
making
a
few
inquiries
paid
a
visit
to
the
minister
as
luck
would
have
it
he
met
him
coming
out
of
his
garden
he
looked
somewhat
scared
and
when
he
saw
chard
uniform
he
hastened
towards
him
what
is
this
what
is
this
he
asked
hurriedly
i
hear
that
a
terrible
crime
has
been
committed
yes
sir
said
chard
with
military
brevity
are
you
mr
johnson
that
is
my
name
but
this
murder
i
have
come
to
speak
to
you
about
it
mr
johnson
to
speak
to
me
repeated
the
minister
whose
face
looked
emaciated
and
painfully
white
why
what
have
i
to
do
with
it
do
you
know
who
has
been
murdered
asked
chard
with
a
keen
glance
no
how
should
i
my
mother
was
in
the
town
just
now
and
returned
with
a
story
of
some
crime
having
been
committed
she
is
rather
deaf
and
heard
no
details
i
was
coming
to
the
to
make
inquiries
i
will
answer
all
your
inquiries
now
sir
please
take
me
within
doors
but
who
are
you
asked
johnson
who
did
not
recognize
the
officer
inspector
chard
of
the
poldew
i
come
to
ask
you
a
few
questions
about
what
said
johnson
conducting
the
inspector
into
the
study
about
the
dead
woman
ah
johnson
dropped
into
his
chair
with
a
gasp
a
woman
the
victim
then
is
a
woman
he
looked
swiftly
at
the
stern
police
officer
and
passed
his
tongue
over
his
dry
lips
what
questions
can
i
answer
i
know
nothing
of
this
poor
soul
pardon
me
sir
but
i
think
that
is
not
quite
correct
replied
the
inspector
dryly
then
with
an
observant
eye
the
dead
woman
is
i
believe
a
native
girl
who
tera
johnson
leaped
up
and
shrieked
the
name
tera
he
repeated
and
dropped
back
into
his
chair
i
i
knew
it
you
knew
it
echoed
the
inspector
pouncing
upon
the
admission
and
how
did
you
know
it
be
careful
sir
for
your
own
sake
be
careful
but
the
minister
was
heeding
him
not
at
all
indeed
in
his
then
state
of
mind
it
is
questionable
whether
he
even
heard
the
man
certainly
he
in
no
wise
took
in
the
meaning
of
the
warnings
tera
he
moaned
resting
his
forehead
on
the
table
oh
bithiah
who
is
bithiah
asked
chard
still
on
the
alert
for
any
clue
bithiah
is
tera
said
johnson
lifting
his
haggard
face
when
we
received
her
into
the
fold
we
named
her
bithiah
and
now
she
is
dead
dead
who
killed
her
he
demanded
with
a
sudden
fierceness
that
is
what
i
wish
to
learn
johnson
and
if
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
answer
my
questions
we
may
perhaps
arrive
at
some
clue
to
lead
us
to
the
discovery
of
the
assassin
the
minister
wiped
the
perspiration
from
his
forehead
and
drew
a
long
breath
chard
could
see
that
the
man
nerves
were
shattered
and
that
he
was
suffering
from
severe
mental
excitement
and
physical
prostration
how
long
have
you
been
ill
asked
the
inspector
suddenly
i
am
not
ill
i
am
worried
oh
there
was
a
world
of
meaning
in
chard
ejaculation
then
how
long
have
you
been
so
worried
i
do
know
shall
we
say
a
month
by
this
time
the
minister
was
beginning
to
see
that
there
was
something
strange
in
the
officer
attitude
why
a
month
he
asked
as
a
new
fear
filled
him
the
body
we
found
has
been
lying
in
the
field
for
quite
a
month
man
cried
johnson
with
a
wild
stare
you
do
mean
to
infer
that
i
killed
her
i
i
infer
nothing
sir
i
am
here
to
procure
information
to
ask
questions
not
to
answer
them
this
dead
woman
was
your
ward
she
left
you
as
i
understand
a
month
ago
and
has
not
been
heard
of
since
we
find
her
dead
body
in
a
cornfield
belonging
to
carwell
it
is
my
duty
to
learn
how
she
came
there
how
she
came
to
be
strangled
strangled
was
she
strangled
yes
said
chard
dryly
she
was
strangled
and
her
body
was
hidden
in
the
thick
of
the
standing
corn
a
very
clever
method
of
concealment
i
do
think
i
ever
heard
of
a
cornfield
being
used
for
such
a
purpose
before
moreover
and
mr
inspector
leaned
forward
the
body
has
been
robbed
robbed
yes
the
pearls
you
know
the
pearls
repeated
johnson
vacantly
oh
yes
the
pearls
but
what
are
they
what
is
anything
compared
with
her
death
oh
i
loved
her
how
i
loved
her
and
she
is
dead
he
leaned
his
head
on
his
hands
and
wept
chard
was
becoming
a
trifle
impatient
the
man
was
in
such
a
state
of
mental
excitement
and
physical
debility
that
it
seemed
unlikely
he
would
prove
of
much
use
at
present
at
all
events
still
he
was
the
person
of
all
others
from
whom
details
regarding
the
past
life
of
the
dead
girl
could
best
be
learned
and
in
her
past
life
might
be
found
a
motive
sufficiently
strong
to
lead
to
some
clue
ever
prepared
for
emergencies
chard
produced
a
flask
of
brandy
from
his
pocket
and
pouring
a
little
of
it
into
a
cup
handed
it
to
johnson
as
the
odour
of
the
spirit
struck
his
nostrils
the
minister
recoiled
with
a
look
of
disgust
i
am
an
abstainer
said
he
waving
it
away
that
may
be
rejoined
chard
imperturbably
but
you
are
all
broken
up
and
weak
now
little
wine
for
the
stomach
sake
as
paul
says
you
can
hardly
go
against
paul
sir
drink
it
he
added
sharply
i
insist
upon
your
drinking
it
you
have
no
right
to
speak
to
me
in
that
way
mr
chard
i
have
the
right
of
a
retorted
the
inspector
i
wish
to
learn
all
about
this
woman
you
can
supply
the
information
i
require
though
at
present
you
are
hardly
fit
to
do
so
drink
the
brandy
i
say
and
pull
yourself
together
i
am
quite
able
to
answer
your
questions
without
the
aid
of
alcohol
thank
you
replied
johnson
in
so
dignified
a
tone
that
the
officer
did
not
press
him
further
what
is
it
you
seek
to
know
chard
shrugged
his
shoulders
drank
off
the
brandy
himself
and
slipping
the
flask
into
his
pocket
commenced
a
brisk
examination
who
is
or
rather
who
was
this
girl
he
asked
taking
out
his
to
note
down
the
answers
to
his
inquiries
a
polynesian
girl
from
the
island
of
koiau
in
the
south
seas
and
how
did
she
happen
to
be
in
england
she
was
brought
here
by
myself
mr
inspector
for
a
year
or
more
i
was
a
missionary
in
koiau
and
while
there
i
gained
the
of
buli
the
high
chief
he
inclined
his
ear
to
our
faith
and
i
believe
would
have
become
a
professed
christian
had
not
the
heathen
party
been
so
strong
that
they
might
have
deposed
and
killed
him
as
it
was
he
asked
me
to
take
his
daughter
tera
to
england
and
have
her
educated
in
one
of
our
schools
so
that
she
might
return
civilized
and
converted
to
do
good
in
her
own
land
i
accepted
the
charge
and
after
baptizing
the
girl
as
bithiah
i
brought
her
to
england
and
put
her
to
a
school
near
london
she
was
there
for
a
year
and
a
few
months
ago
she
came
here
to
live
with
my
mother
and
myself
pending
her
return
to
koiau
oh
she
was
about
to
return
you
say
yes
her
father
being
old
and
frail
wished
her
to
come
back
that
he
might
claim
her
as
his
successor
he
sent
home
another
missionary
named
korah
brand
to
escort
her
back
it
was
only
shortly
before
her
death
that
i
told
brand
he
could
take
her
away
you
say
you
loved
her
johnson
flushed
and
looked
troubled
the
confession
escaped
me
in
my
sorrow
he
said
in
a
low
voice
i
must
ask
you
to
respect
the
privacy
of
a
statement
made
under
such
circumstances
nevertheless
i
fear
you
must
speak
of
it
said
chard
if
i
am
to
trace
the
murderer
of
this
poor
creature
i
must
know
all
about
her
well
i
do
care
who
knows
cried
the
minister
recklessly
i
have
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
yes
mr
inspector
i
loved
her
and
i
asked
her
to
marry
me
she
refused
declaring
she
was
in
love
with
a
man
named
jack
finland
oh
here
is
a
fresh
element
and
who
is
finland
may
i
ask
a
sailor
a
nephew
of
farmer
carwell
h
said
chard
and
it
was
in
farmer
carwell
field
the
body
was
found
strange
i
do
think
finland
killed
her
expostulated
johnson
with
some
eagerness
he
is
not
a
godly
man
and
it
is
true
i
believe
that
he
is
a
trifle
dissipated
in
his
habits
but
he
is
a
cheery
sailor
and
he
loved
the
girl
dearly
indeed
i
am
certain
that
he
is
innocent
all
men
are
presumed
to
be
innocent
until
they
are
found
guilty
said
the
officer
dryly
and
where
is
finland
now
at
sea
for
all
i
know
he
left
grimleigh
three
weeks
ago
to
join
his
ship
in
london
do
you
happen
to
know
the
ship
name
no
replied
johnson
coldly
i
was
not
sufficiently
interested
in
finland
to
ask
farmer
carwell
may
know
i
will
ask
him
said
mr
inspector
making
a
note
in
his
book
and
now
johnson
tell
me
when
this
girl
ran
away
on
the
evening
of
august
why
did
she
go
because
i
informed
her
that
for
the
future
brand
would
take
charge
of
her
and
would
not
let
her
see
finland
again
i
was
absent
when
she
went
away
but
my
mother
tells
me
that
she
left
the
house
between
five
and
six
what
did
you
do
i
went
out
to
look
for
her
when
i
returned
i
did
not
think
she
had
run
away
but
that
she
had
merely
gone
for
a
stroll
i
therefore
went
out
to
find
her
and
escort
her
home
did
you
see
her
no
i
walked
about
for
nearly
two
hours
but
i
saw
nothing
of
her
was
there
any
circumstance
which
seemed
to
point
to
her
having
run
away
well
the
pearls
were
missing
buli
gave
his
daughter
a
bag
of
pearls
worth
at
least
three
thousand
pounds
she
was
to
sell
them
and
with
the
money
buy
goods
to
take
back
to
koiau
but
she
was
not
to
do
so
until
immediately
before
her
departure
for
safety
i
took
charge
of
them
and
they
were
usually
locked
up
in
a
drawer
of
this
desk
did
the
girl
know
where
they
were
oh
yes
i
showed
them
to
her
frequently
on
the
day
she
left
i
forgot
to
take
my
keys
with
me
and
when
i
returned
both
bithiah
and
the
pearls
were
gone
then
it
was
that
it
crossed
my
mind
she
might
have
run
away
with
finland
johnson
shook
his
head
finland
was
questioned
by
mr
brand
about
that
said
he
and
denied
having
seen
the
girl
he
left
grimleigh
a
week
after
her
disappearance
do
you
think
finland
is
guilty
i
have
already
said
that
i
do
not
chard
he
loved
the
girl
and
she
was
quite
willing
to
marry
him
and
give
up
her
fortune
so
i
do
not
see
what
motive
he
could
have
had
to
kill
her
no
sir
finland
is
innocent
had
the
girl
any
enemies
not
that
i
know
of
can
you
surmise
who
killed
her
johnson
raised
his
head
solemnly
as
the
lord
god
liveth
i
can
not
he
said
and
his
answer
had
all
the
solemnity
of
an
oath
this
ended
the
examination
for
the
time
being
and
mr
inspector
disappeared
it
was
yet
too
early
for
him
to
make
up
his
mind
but
he
was
strongly
of
opinion
that
johnson
knew
more
than
he
chose
to
confess
chapter
vi
constable
slade
discovery
there
are
policemen
who
in
their
own
eyes
are
wholly
estimable
in
grimleigh
dwelt
such
a
one
he
was
a
lean
solemn
taciturn
being
with
red
hair
and
moustache
a
freckled
face
and
the
coldest
of
blue
eyes
shrewdly
observant
in
proportion
to
their
coldness
the
man
really
possessed
capabilities
though
for
want
of
opportunity
they
had
grown
rusty
but
that
was
not
his
fault
to
arrest
drunken
sailors
and
seek
out
rural
malefactors
of
a
type
and
to
see
to
it
that
were
not
open
after
prescribed
hours
of
such
order
were
the
duties
of
jeremiah
slade
and
the
paltriness
of
them
filled
his
ambitious
soul
with
disgust
for
this
village
constable
was
an
omnivorous
reader
of
the
detective
novel
and
ardently
admired
the
preternatural
acuteness
and
dexterity
brought
into
play
by
the
fictitious
who
therein
are
depicted
as
ever
able
to
solve
the
most
impenetrable
of
mysteries
he
longed
for
a
chance
to
distinguish
himself
after
the
same
fashion
and
he
chafed
that
opportunity
was
so
long
withheld
but
now
his
hour
had
come
as
we
are
told
it
comes
to
all
men
who
know
how
to
wait
and
the
discovery
of
tera
body
in
the
cornfield
seemed
to
promise
a
criminal
thesis
intricate
enough
even
for
his
most
ambitious
desires
now
jeremiah
was
a
married
man
married
within
the
last
twelve
months
to
a
diminutive
albeit
not
tyrant
whose
greatest
of
all
desires
was
to
live
at
poldew
if
only
slade
could
be
transferred
to
that
centre
of
gaiety
so
different
from
grimleigh
the
little
woman
would
be
perfectly
happy
at
least
she
thought
so
now
if
only
jeremiah
could
distinguish
himself
in
the
performance
of
his
duties
sufficiently
to
attract
the
intelligent
and
eye
of
inspector
chard
it
was
not
beyond
the
bounds
of
probability
that
the
transference
might
come
to
pass
therefore
was
mistress
slade
ever
goading
her
good
man
to
accomplish
the
impossible
she
was
as
anxious
as
nay
more
so
than
he
that
some
tragedy
of
ample
dimensions
should
take
place
she
too
saw
nothing
but
promotion
and
glory
in
the
mysterious
murder
of
tera
and
the
morning
after
the
body
had
been
transferred
to
the
she
chose
to
attack
jeremiah
on
the
subject
while
she
prepared
his
breakfast
slade
sat
over
the
kitchen
fire
reading
the
moonstone
he
hoped
therefrom
to
extract
inspiration
for
the
task
which
he
was
about
to
undertake
it
is
truly
an
ill
wind
that
blows
nobody
any
good
and
the
slades
looked
on
the
tragic
fate
of
tera
as
the
foundation
of
their
humble
fortunes
jerry
said
slade
pouring
out
the
tea

your
chance

that
nigger
girl

her
island

jeremiah
his

what

suddenly
enlightened

jeremiah

three
times
and
drank
his
cup
to
the
dregs
and
do
you
go
talkin
about
it
neither
or
you
never
get
to
poldew
d
i
be
as
silent
as
the
tomb
said
slade
who
was
a
virago
chiefly
so
far
as
domestic
matters
were
concerned
what
makes
you
think
as
johnson
did
it
jerry
i
seen
myself
and
that
pale
he
could
kill
a
little
fly
know
mr
mayne
at
the
mention
of
this

the
virago
side
of
slade
obtruded
itself
yes

and
ashamed
i

to

it
oh

like
that
jeremiah
i

gipsy
girls
that

in
the
exercise
of
my
dooty
zara
lovell
was
your
duty
jeremiah
the
way
as
you

mayne
to
that
girl
was
disgraceful
it
was
if
them
gipsies

away
her
pharaoh
lee

knifed

he
was
her
only
goin
to
be

jeremiah
ferociously
all
that
dead
and
done
with
two
years
ago
i
ai
got
nothin
to
do
with
zara
now
ai
i
married

to
poldew
if

now
if

weep
i

i
ai
crying
jerry
said
slade
hastily
wiping
her
eyes
with
her
apron
tell
me
lovey
what
this
about
mr
mayne
well
i
knowed
was
at
the
findin
of
the
body
which
i
was
said
the
mollified
jeremiah
so
i
arsk
him
a
few
questions
as
we
was
always
of
a
friendly
turn
with
one
another
them
gipsies
was
look
want
me
to
go
i
go
sure
enough
if
you
do
stop
rakin
up
them
gipsies
dearly
would
slade
have
liked
to
develop
her
embryo
quarrel
for
she
loved
a
few
high
words
just
to
clear
the
air
as
she
put
it
but
an
indulgence
to
this
extent
meant
that
her
curiosity
might
not
be
gratified
it
might
possibly
even
jeopardize
the
contemplated
transfer
to
poldew
so
with
great
and
praiseworthy
she
curbed
her
tongue
and
nodded
to
her
husband
to
continue
mayne
said
slade
with
a
scowl
at
her
told
me
as
johnson
was
in
love
with
this
girl
and
she
ran
away
from
not
forgettin
to
take
three
thousand
pounds
worth
of
pearls
with
lor
you
do
say
screeched
slade
her
eyes
starting
out
of
her
head
johnson
says
she
run
away
added
jeremiah
but
i
ai
read
my
books
for
nothin
them
as
does
the
deed
always
tells
lies
his
voice
was
veritably
tragic
now
if
she
did
run
away
jemima
she
only
got
as
far
as
that
there
cornfield
there
in
the
dark
night
the
villain
strangled
in
all
her
youthful
beauty
this
was
clearly
the
influence
of
the
detective
novelist
an
stole
the
jewels
to
pay
debts
lor
cried
slade
again
you
do
say
as
johnson
has
debts
all
grimleigh
could
pay
what
he
owes
oh
is
the
murderer
right
enough
jemima
so
i
to
see
mr
brand
and
find
out
what
knows
about
this
parson
chap
then
i
call
on
and
a
squint
round
parlour
you
ai
likely
to
find
nothing
there
do
you
be
so
mighty
sure
about
that
missus
i
might
find
them
pearls
lor
jeremiah
what
a
great
man
you
are
and
will
you
tell
all
this
to
mr
chard
not
till
i
have
a
complete
case
against
johnson
when
i
then
i
go
to
him
and
i
say
art
the
man
and
run
in
then
we
go
to
poldew
oh
ca
i
help
jeremiah
well
said
the
policeman
in
a
patronizing
tone
you
might
see
johnson
and
pick
up
what
yer
can
she
an
old
lady
as
talks
freely
so
find
out
if
the
nigger
girl
and
johnson
a
row
that
be
strong
circumstanshal
evidence
i
do
it
jeremiah
i
do
it
i
can
easy
take
up
some
fish
as
a
gift
to
johnson
i
met
her
two
or
three
times
and
she
got
a
friendly
side
to
me
mind
you
careful
jemima
and
above
all
your
tongue
enunciating
these
words
in
his
most
majestic
manner
the
new
vidocq
put
on
his
helmet
and
left
jemima
doing
her
best
to
cork
up
the
information
she
had
received
no
easy
task
for
a
lady
with
a
tongue
excessively
developed
longitudinally
in
the
mean
time
grimleigh
was
in
a
great
state
of
excitement
it
was
rarely
that
a
murder
occurred
in
their
quiet
neighbourhood
and
this
fact
coupled
with
their
intimate
knowledge
of
the
victim
roused
their
interest
in
an
extraordinary
degree
the
inquest
was
to
take
place
in
the
afternoon
at
the
fisherman
rest
a
hostel
near
the
shed
in
which
the
body
had
been
laid
out
the
town
was
on
tiptoe
of
excitement
amongst
the
witnesses
whom
chard
intended
to
call
was
johnson
and
he
sent
up
the
astute
slade
to
serve
the
minister
with
a
subp
oe
na
jeremiah
was
delighted
at
this
chance
which
as
likely
as
not
would
bring
him
into
the
study
of
the
man
he
suspected
he
resolved
to
use
his
eyes
sharply
fortune
often
acts
generously
when
she
acts
at
all
and
as
slade
was
climbing
the
hill
he
met
korah
brand
this
was
the
very
man
he
wanted
to
see
and
he
at
once
saluted
him
what
is
it
asked
brand
impatiently
he
looked
older
than
usual
and
a
trifle
pale
it
was
evident
that
the
loss
of
tera
had
affected
him
in
an
unusual
degree
as
in
truth
it
had
for
without
tera
brand
did
not
care
to
return
to
koiau
if
he
did
it
would
be
at
the
risk
of
his
life
for
on
learning
of
his
daughter
death
buli
would
as
likely
as
not
sacrifice
the
luckless
missionary
on
the
altar
of
his
god
it
was
therefore
with
no
very
great
good
will
that
he
submitted
to
be
stopped
by
this
goliath
who
are
you
asked
korah
with
a
growl
jeremiah
slade
replied
the
officer
i
am
a
in
this
town
i
am
on
my
way
to
serve
johnson
with
a
subp
oe
na
oh
the
shame
the
shame
that
has
fallen
on
bethgamul
said
brand
in
tones
of
deep
grief
our
dear
sister
is
taken
and
our
pastor
has
to
bow
down
in
the
temple
of
rimmon
he
got
to
appear
at
the
inquest
if
that
what
you
mean
sir
but
this
subp
oe
na
slade
looked
round
anxiously
then
approached
his
mouth
to
the
missionary
ear
why
should
it
be
a
warrant
brand
turned
a
shade
paler
and
fixed
a
keen
eye
on
slade
whose
meaning
he
at
once
seized
do
you
know
any
reason
why
it
should
be
a
warrant
he
asked
sharply
i
have
my
own
idea
sir
what
is
your
idea
slade
took
time
to
consider
and
pulled
his
red
moustache
see
here
mr
brand
he
said
softly
do
you
want
disgrace
to
fall
on
that
chapel
of
yours
why
no
i
would
do
anything
to
avert
that
well
then
sir
do
ask
me
questions
about
your
parson
the
missionary
bent
his
shaggy
brows
on
the
man
and
stroked
his
beard
do
you
suspect
mr
johnson
yes
i
do
but
nobody
else
does
except
yourself
i
brand
started
back
in
dismay
thee
behind
me
satan
why
should
i
suspect
him
jeremiah
tapped
him
on
the
chest
if
you
hold
your
tongue
i
can
hold
mine
said
he
and
turned
away
in
a
moment
brand
was
after
him
clutching
his
arm
man
what
do
you
mean
gammon
you
know
johnson
killed
that
girl
oh
brand
withdrew
his
arm
with
a
moan
i
feared
so
i
greatly
feared
so
how
do
you
know
i
tell
you
if
you
answer
my
questions
and
work
with
me
any
questions
i
can
answer
i
will
but
work
with
you
why
should
i
do
that
to
get
that
parson
chap
arrested
no
no
think
of
the
disgrace
to
bethgamul
i
want
him
saved
from
the
consequences
of
his
sin
we
think
about
that
when
we
prove
his
guilt
said
slade
dryly
but
see
here
it
a
chance
of
his
escape
i
offering
you
if
i
tell
chard
all
i
know
you
wo
get
your
parson
off
i
can
tell
you
i
want
to
find
out
the
truth
of
this
mystery
to
get
promotion
help
me
to
find
out
who
killed
the
girl
and
i
perhaps
make
things
safe
for
the
man
as
done
it
this
was
purely
a
treacherous
offer
as
slade
knew
that
he
could
not
get
promotion
unless
the
murderer
of
tera
was
discovered
and
hanged
however
korah
brand
did
not
know
this
and
hoping
to
save
johnson
which
for
the
sake
of
the
chapel
he
really
wished
to
do
he
at
once
decided
to
accept
slade
offer
i
help
you
all
i
can
he
said
on
condition
that
you
do
tell
the
inspector
should
we
find
out
the
truth
it
a
bargain
then
slade
was
delighted
with
the
result
of
this
diplomacy
already
he
felt
worthy
to
rank
with
the
heroes
of
any
of
his
favourite
novels
now
then
johnson
in
debt
is
he
yes
deeply
in
debt
the
follies
of
his
youth
he
now
knows
how
true
is
the
text
sure
thy
sin
will
find
thee
out
he
find
it
truer
when
i
done
with
him
said
jeremiah
grimly
well
sir
these
pearls
the
girl
had
with
her
yes
she
took
away
some
pearls
johnson
said
so
very
good
then
johnson
murdered
her
for
those
pearls
so
that
he
might
sell
them
and
pay
his
debts
how
do
you
know
it
a
theory
a
very
bad
one
said
brand
a
worldly
nature
appearing
through
his
religious
veneer
the
girl
left
the
house
with
the
pearls
during
johnson
absence
yes
but
johnson
followed
her
what
of
that
he
did
not
see
her
he
says
he
did
not
oh
cried
slade
contemptuously
he
say
anything
to
save
his
neck
why
herbert
mayne
met
him
coming
from
the
cornfield
in
which
the
body
was
found
that
very
night
you
believe
me
mr
brand
johnson
met
the
girl
there
strangled
her
sold
the
pearls
and
hid
her
body
in
the
corn
you
ca
prove
that
we
can
prove
it
between
us
mr
brand
you
can
prove
as
johnson
was
sweet
on
the
girl
and
she
have
nothing
to
do
with
him
you
can
swear
as
the
pearls
his
servant
by
them
bills
and
letters
she
picked
up
can
show
that
he
was
in
debt
and
mayne
can
declare
as
johnson
left
the
cornfield
on
the
night
the
girl
ran
away
but
all
this
is
merely
circumstantial
evidence
argued
the
missionary
men
have
been
hanged
on
as
much
before
now
but
i
dare
say
we
can
make
the
case
stronger
i
going
to
serve
this
on
johnson
so
in
his
study
maybe
i
see
something
of
them
pearls
if
he
had
the
pearls
you
may
be
sure
he
has
disposed
of
them
by
this
time
said
brand
with
a
sudden
thought
after
bithiah
disappeared
he
went
up
to
london
and
was
away
for
a
week
he
said
it
was
to
search
for
her
but
i
dare
say
it
was
to
sell
the
pearls
might
be
sir
but
if
he
got
the
money
for
them
he
have
paid
his
debts
we
must
find
out
if
he
has
very
good
i
leave
that
part
of
it
to
you
and
now
sir
i
get
to
business
you
wait
for
me
here
and
i
come
back
after
i
have
had
a
squint
round
that
room
and
tell
yer
my
impressions
you
ca
do
much
in
so
short
a
time
i
can
watch
his
face
as
i
serve
this
subp
oe
na
if
guilty
guess
i
twig
it
trust
me
i
ai
read
detective
stories
for
nothin
with
a
complacent
nod
slade
made
off
and
brand
watched
him
enter
the
minister
house
he
was
absent
for
some
ten
minutes
during
which
time
korah
stood
staring
at
the
sea
and
wondered
how
he
could
return
to
his
mission
work
at
koiau
without
tera
absorbed
in
these
thoughts
he
failed
to
hear
slade
returning
footsteps
and
it
was
only
when
he
felt
a
touch
on
his
shoulder
that
he
turned
to
see
the
triumphant
face
of
the
man
what
have
you
found
he
asked
guessing
that
slade
had
made
some
discovery
well
i
saw
johnson
and
he
took
the
subp
oe
na
turning
as
pale
as
all
villains
then
i
looked
about
me
a
bit
i
noticed
the
curtains
on
the
winder
i
know
i
know
groaned
brand
vanity
and
vexation
and
gauds
of
the
world
gay
curtains
they
are
tied
back
with
red
white
and
blue
cords
yes
but
one
of
them
cords
is
gone
mr
brand
cried
slade
exultingly
we
got
that
girl
was
strangled
with
a
red
white
and
blue
cord
it
ai
drawing
back
the
curtain
now
no
sir
round
her
throat
chapter
vii
the
minister
debts
slade
was
present
at
the
inquest
he
was
deeply
interested
in
the
proceedings
and
every
now
and
then
he
might
have
been
seen
to
smile
in
a
saturnine
way
for
his
own
purposes
he
had
impressed
on
brand
the
necessity
of
absolute
silence
concerning
the
discovery
in
study
that
one
of
them
was
used
to
choke
the
girl
proves
a
good
deal
he
said
emphasizing
with
a
stumpy
finger
on
the
palm
of
his
hand
but
it
do
quite
show
as
johnson
killed
the
girl
but
even
before
you
found
out
about
the
cord
you
were
sure
that
he
was
guilty
and
i
sure
now
mr
brand
that
i
am
but
i
wants
certain
facts
to
build
up
a
complete
case
against
him
facts
as
he
ca
deny
now
this
is
one
fact
but
for
all
that
some
one
might
have
been
in
the
room
and
took
it
just
to
get
johnson
into
trouble
now
my
wife
jemima
she
as
sharp
as
sharp
she
been
speaking
to
old
johnson
who
talks
a
lot
and
johnson
says
as
this
girl
and
her
son
had
a
quarrel
over
her
refusing
him
afore
the
murder
that
strengthens
the
case
against
mr
johnson
hold
on
sir
johnson
says
as
the
was
missing
three
days
afore
that
row
took
place
now
sir
if
johnson
killed
the
girl
he
would
have
got
ready
the
cord
and
taken
it
away
so
long
afore
he
needed
it
if
he
is
the
murderer
he
killed
the
girl
in
a
fit
of
passion
she
was
running
away
with
the
pearls
as
he
wanted
to
pay
his
debts
with
going
on
this
evidence
sir
some
one
must
have
stolen
that
cord
with
the
idea
of
murder
and
that
some
one
by
reasoning
aforesaid
as
the
lawyers
say
was
george
johnson
then
you
think
that
our
pastor
is
innocent
said
brand
hopefully
i
do
say
nothing
sir
because
i
do
see
clear
wait
till
i
sees
him
at
the
inquest
and
then
we
talk
so
at
the
inquest
slade
was
observant
of
the
minister
demeanour
however
he
gained
little
from
his
scrutiny
johnson
had
exhausted
his
earlier
grief
and
was
cool
and
collected
and
perfectly
willing
to
repeat
the
story
he
had
told
chard
he
answered
the
questions
which
were
put
to
him
but
made
no
voluntary
statement
by
adopting
this
course
he
was
able
to
keep
his
secret
of
the
lost
and
restored
bills
yet
several
times
it
was
in
his
mind
to
tell
chard
of
the
stealthy
footsteps
and
the
theft
it
was
just
possible
he
thought
that
some
one
might
have
seen
him
looking
at
the
pearls
and
afterwards
ascertaining
in
the
same
way
that
tera
had
taken
them
have
followed
the
girl
to
murder
her
for
their
sake
but
after
debating
the
subject
in
his
mind
he
decided
to
hold
his
peace
and
the
evidence
he
gave
while
exonerating
himself
could
throw
no
light
on
the
darkness
which
environed
the
case
nor
had
chard
procured
any
other
evidence
likely
to
elucidate
the
matter
at
all
he
had
not
heard
the
story
of
herbert
mayne
meeting
with
johnson
on
the
night
of
tera
disappearance
near
the
field
in
which
her
body
had
afterwards
been
found
herbert
had
told
this
only
to
rachel
and
the
policeman
slade
the
first
had
remained
silent
lest
the
pastor
whom
she
admired
should
be
accused
of
a
crime
which
she
was
certain
he
had
not
committed
the
second
after
relating
the
incident
to
brand
had
agreed
with
him
that
until
they
found
fresh
evidence
it
was
best
to
hold
their
tongues
therefore
no
one
but
these
three
knew
that
johnson
had
actually
been
near
the
scene
of
the
crime
and
in
the
minister
admission
to
chard
he
had
merely
stated
that
he
had
searched
two
hours
for
the
girl
johnson
repeated
his
former
story
and
the
jury
did
the
best
they
could
with
it
for
no
other
evidence
was
procurable
there
was
indeed
some
talk
of
finland
and
his
departure
but
as
every
one
knew
that
he
loved
tera
and
could
have
secured
both
the
girl
and
the
pearls
by
marrying
her
a
course
to
which
she
was
generally
known
as
willing
to
consent
no
one
thought
of
taxing
him
with
the
crime
the
peculiarity
of
the
silken
cord
used
passed
unnoticed
strange
to
say
a
london
detective
would
have
been
struck
by
it
immediately
but
chard
and
his
subordinates
were
unaccustomed
to
such
finnicky
data
and
it
escaped
them
altogether
on
such
spare
evidence
it
can
easily
be
guessed
what
verdict
was
given
by
the
thickheaded
jury
chosen
from
the
grimleigh
wiseacres
they
decided
that
tera
alias
bithiah
a
native
of
polynesia
had
been
murdered
by
some
person
or
persons
unknown
and
when
the
proceedings
terminated
all
those
present
thought
they
had
heard
the
last
of
the
matter
slade
chuckled
and
rubbed
his
hands
for
now
that
chard
seemed
likely
to
abandon
inquiries
as
useless
he
could
go
to
work
at
his
leisure
and
build
up
a
case
as
he
chose
so
far
he
had
suspected
johnson
alone
but
on
reconsidering
the
incident
of
the
having
been
stolen
three
days
before
tera
disappearance
he
concluded
that
some
other
person
also
was
concerned
in
the
matter
who
that
person
might
be
slade
in
his
present
state
of
indecision
was
not
prepared
to
say
having
fulfilled
the
official
part
of
his
duties
inspector
chard
returned
to
the
grimleigh
police
office
for
a
rest
preparatory
to
riding
back
to
poldew
while
there
he
was
informed
that
korah
brand
wished
to
speak
to
him
and
on
the
assumption
that
the
man
having
been
connected
with
tera
might
have
something
of
importance
to
say
he
admitted
him
at
once
to
an
interview
well
mr
brand
said
chard
genially
and
what
can
i
do
for
you
i
want
to
know
about
this
poor
girl
murder
sir
replied
brand
in
his
heavy
solemn
way
what
are
you
going
to
do
now
why
mr
brand
i
have
no
very
definite
plans
but
i
may
tell
you
that
i
intend
to
search
for
those
pearls
what
will
that
do
reveal
the
identity
of
the
murderer
there
is
no
doubt
in
my
mind
nor
can
there
be
in
yours
that
tera
was
murdered
for
the
sake
of
the
pearls
now
whoever
has
them
will
surely
turn
them
into
money
to
do
so
he
must
sell
them
to
some
jeweller
or
pawnbroker
i
intend
to
communicate
with
the
london
police
on
this
point
they
may
discover
who
sold
or
pawned
them
and
thus
be
able
to
lay
hands
on
the
man
we
are
in
search
of
what
makes
you
think
of
looking
in
london
mr
chard
because
that
sailor
finland
went
up
there
a
week
after
the
girl
disappeared
he
went
to
join
his
ship
said
brand
who
believed
in
innocence
so
he
said
replied
mr
inspector
dryly
a
very
good
excuse
to
get
away
from
the
town
without
suspicion
but
i
do
see
why
you
should
think
finland
guilty
he
assured
me
most
solemnly
that
he
never
set
eyes
on
bithiah
on
that
night
oh
i
dare
say
but
finland
is
carwell
nephew
the
body
was
found
in
one
of
carwell
fields
so
it
is
not
beyond
the
bounds
of
probability
that
finland
placed
it
there
i
do
believe
it
cried
brand
vigorously
bithiah
i
believe
ran
away
to
marry
finland
and
by
such
marriage
he
could
have
secured
both
her
and
the
pearls
why
should
he
kill
her
when
korah
placed
the
matter
in
this
light
inspector
chard
was
puzzled
and
unable
to
answer
the
question
lost
his
temper
i
do
pretend
to
be
infallible
said
he
harshly
and
i
may
be
mistaken
all
the
same
i
believe
finland
to
be
guilty
then
why
do
you
arrest
him
because
i
have
not
sufficient
evidence
to
enable
me
to
get
a
warrant
replied
the
inspector
tartly
nor
do
i
know
where
the
man
is
however
it
is
my
intention
to
find
out
if
possible
the
whereabouts
of
those
pearls
for
which
the
girl
was
murdered
when
i
learn
who
disposed
of
them
i
shall
be
able
to
capture
the
murderer
he
wo
be
finland
sir
that
we
shall
see
retorted
chard
and
closed
an
interview
in
which
he
felt
he
was
getting
the
worst
of
the
argument
brand
left
the
with
the
conviction
that
tera
murderer
would
never
be
discovered
by
this
mulish
officer
slade
had
twice
the
man
brains
and
decision
and
korah
resolved
to
rely
on
him
for
the
conduct
of
the
case
he
looked
round
for
the
policeman
but
not
finding
him
and
feeling
he
must
talk
with
some
one
about
the
matter
he
hurried
up
the
hill
to
johnson
house
as
slade
suspected
johnson
and
as
the
queer
incident
of
the
lost
proved
that
there
was
some
ground
for
such
suspicions
brand
thought
he
would
do
a
little
business
on
his
own
account
and
question
the
minister
in
the
course
of
conversation
he
thought
some
evidence
might
be
discovered
likely
to
incriminate
johnson
korah
was
inclined
to
beseech
the
young
man
to
fly
lest
he
should
be
arrested
and
lest
disgrace
should
fall
upon
the
chapel
people
of
grimleigh
even
as
matters
stood
now
johnson
was
in
a
dangerous
position
on
entering
the
study
brand
cast
a
glance
at
the
window
and
saw
that
as
slade
had
stated
one
of
the
cords
was
missing
this
fact
made
him
wonder
if
johnson
had
really
strangled
the
girl
with
it
and
if
so
whether
he
had
committed
the
crime
in
order
to
secure
the
pearls
for
the
payment
of
his
debts
or
in
a
fit
of
despair
caused
by
the
rejection
of
his
love
if
haggard
looks
which
might
be
the
outcome
of
remorse
went
for
anything
johnson
was
guilty
for
the
man
was
white
and
dark
circles
were
under
his
eyes
his
manner
of
greeting
his
visitor
was
uneasy
and
he
looked
as
though
he
had
not
slept
for
hours
on
the
other
hand
this
physical
deterioration
might
be
caused
by
grief
for
tera
death
do
you
wish
to
see
me
particularly
brother
korah
asked
johnson
lifting
his
heavy
eyes
with
a
weary
look
i
am
scarcely
fit
to
talk
brand
sat
down
and
assumed
a
stern
demeanour
is
this
sorrow
on
account
of
your
earthly
passion
brother
or
because
an
immortal
soul
has
been
lost
bithiah
soul
has
not
been
lost
cried
johnson
stirred
out
of
his
apathy
to
honest
indignation
she
was
a
good
girl
a
true
christian
her
death
was
a
martyrdom
yet
she
died
in
sin
persisted
the
missionary
she
fled
from
your
house
with
evil
in
her
heart
and
with
the
pearls
the
pearls
were
her
own
property
no
brother
they
were
entrusted
to
her
care
by
buli
that
she
might
buy
goods
for
the
civilization
of
kioau
she
was
his
steward
and
had
no
right
to
remove
the
pearls
from
your
keeping
but
these
matters
added
brand
taking
a
more
worldly
tone
we
can
discuss
at
leisure
the
question
now
and
the
one
about
which
i
came
to
see
you
is
the
funeral
i
have
arranged
with
inspector
chard
about
the
funeral
said
johnson
wearily
the
poor
remains
are
to
be
buried
in
our
own
cemetery
and
i
shall
read
the
service
over
the
dead
poor
tera
it
is
all
i
can
do
for
her
you
will
bury
bithiah
the
christian
but
not
tera
the
pagan
brother
do
you
think
you
are
wise
to
appear
at
the
funeral
why
not
brother
korah
there
may
be
a
riot
a
riot
johnson
looked
surprised
and
why
should
there
be
a
riot
if
i
appear
the
missionary
looked
perplexed
and
tugged
at
his
grey
beard
brother
brother
he
said
in
a
tone
of
remonstrance
do
you
not
know
that
public
opinion
credits
you
with
the
crime
johnson
rose
slowly
with
a
look
of
horror
on
his
colourless
face
but
this
speedily
gave
way
to
an
expression
of
indignation
who
dares
to
say
such
a
thing
he
demanded
it
is
the
general
opinion
rejoined
korah
coldly
you
were
near
the
field
where
the
body
was
found
on
the
very
night
bithiah
disappeared
on
the
very
night
when
if
we
go
by
medical
evidence
the
girl
was
murdered
i
was
looking
for
her
bithiah
often
walked
near
that
field
and
i
thought
it
likely
that
i
should
find
her
there
kill
her
i
swear
to
you
brand
that
i
would
as
soon
have
killed
myself
as
her
i
loved
her
dearly
why
then
should
i
commit
a
crime
contrary
to
my
earthly
love
to
my
religious
principles
i
do
not
accuse
you
the
public
voice
does
that
replied
brand
still
cold
and
unsympathetic
you
are
known
to
be
in
debt
i
am
not
in
debt
now
interrupted
johnson
hurriedly
all
my
debts
are
paid
paid
your
debts
paid
brand
was
thunderstruck
for
this
was
the
last
thing
he
expected
to
hear
how
did
you
pay
them
he
demanded
with
sudden
suspicion
i
did
not
pay
them
brand
then
who
did
i
do
know
was
johnson
extraordinary
reply
brand
looked
at
him
sternly
and
droned
out
a
proverb
shall
they
eat
of
the
fruit
of
their
own
way
and
be
filled
with
their
own
devices
he
quoted
what
do
you
mean
brother
brother
repeated
korah
rising
with
indignation
i
am
not
a
brother
to
you
man
of
sin
as
you
are
your
debts
are
paid
yes
i
believe
that
you
do
not
know
who
paid
them
liar
you
paid
them
yourself
with
the
wages
of
your
sin
my
sin
gasped
johnson
aghast
do
not
add
deceit
to
your
iniquity
man
you
killed
that
girl
you
stole
her
pearls
when
you
went
to
london
it
was
to
sell
them
now
you
have
paid
your
debts
at
the
cost
of
bithiah
life
sure
thy
sin
will
find
thee
out
it
has
found
you
out
murderer
i
am
no
murderer
cried
the
minister
vehemently
as
i
am
a
living
man
i
had
no
hand
in
her
death
i
never
saw
her
after
she
left
my
house
i
searched
but
in
vain
who
paid
my
debts
i
do
not
know
yesterday
i
found
a
pile
of
receipted
bills
on
this
table
who
put
them
there
i
know
no
more
than
you
do
you
can
not
impose
upon
me
by
such
a
story
said
brand
coldly
debts
like
yours
are
not
paid
by
unknown
people
if
such
were
the
case
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
see
your
creditors
and
ask
who
paid
them
i
intend
to
but
as
yet
i
have
not
had
the
time
after
the
funeral
of
tera
i
am
going
to
london
to
see
my
creditors
and
learn
the
truth
brand
smiled
you
are
going
to
london
he
repeated
that
is
you
intend
to
seek
safety
in
flight
well
it
is
the
best
thing
you
can
do
i
shall
not
betray
your
secret
i
do
not
intend
to
fly
i
have
done
nothing
wrong
man
man
why
will
you
try
to
deceive
me
i
am
your
friend
and
for
your
sake
for
the
sake
of
our
bethesda
i
implore
you
to
fly
what
will
your
congregation
say
if
their
pastor
is
hanged
for
murder
johnson
drew
back
with
a
shudder
hanged
no
they
dare
not
i
am
innocent
you
have
yet
to
prove
that
brand
cried
the
wretched
man
imploringly
you
do
not
believe
that
i
killed
tera
from
my
soul
i
believe
you
did
replied
korah
sternly
and
if
i
did
my
duty
i
should
deliver
you
to
justice
but
for
the
sake
of
bethgamul
i
refrain
my
man
fly
and
repent
of
your
terrible
sin
god
help
you
for
i
can
not
and
with
a
gesture
of
casting
off
a
sinner
brand
walked
out
of
the
room
chapter
viii
captain
jacob
tera
funeral
was
a
function
of
importance
the
entire
population
of
grimleigh
crowded
into
the
little
cemetery
above
the
town
some
of
them
were
drawn
there
in
true
compassion
for
the
terrible
fate
of
the
poor
girl
others
from
sheer
morbidness
but
perhaps
the
greater
part
of
the
people
were
attracted
by
the
expectation
of
a
riot
it
was
vaguely
understood
that
in
some
inexplicable
way
johnson
was
responsible
for
tera
death
it
was
rumoured
that
if
he
had
not
killed
her
himself
and
no
one
was
bold
enough
to
make
that
assertion
he
was
at
least
the
means
of
driving
her
to
destruction
consequently
public
feeling
ran
high
against
the
minister
and
it
was
generally
thought
that
if
he
read
the
service
over
his
victim
there
would
be
trouble
chard
himself
believed
this
and
accordingly
attended
the
funeral
in
person
with
a
posse
of
constabulary
however
these
precautions
proved
unnecessary
for
johnson
was
wise
enough
not
to
put
in
an
appearance
much
less
take
an
active
part
in
the
ceremony
whether
deterred
by
the
advice
of
brand
or
by
the
threats
of
the
townspeople
he
remained
absent
and
tera
was
buried
by
a
minister
from
poldew
who
nearly
created
a
riot
on
his
own
account
by
his
sensational
references
to
the
death
farmer
carwell
and
his
daughter
herbert
mayne
and
miss
arnott
were
all
of
them
present
and
it
was
with
feelings
of
shame
and
indignation
that
they
saw
the
ceremony
presided
over
by
a
strange
divine
when
the
crowd
had
dispersed
carwell
looked
at
the
grave
for
some
moments
in
ominous
silence
then
he
turned
to
korah
brand
who
stood
by
his
side
his
pride
as
an
elder
of
bethgamul
was
hurt
if
our
pastor
can
not
clear
his
character
said
he
sternly
he
must
be
removed
from
the
conduct
of
the
congregation
our
bethgamul
can
not
be
shadowed
thus
by
shame
but
surely
you
do
believe
that
the
pastor
is
guilty
father
urged
rachel
before
brand
could
speak
i
do
not
say
that
he
is
guilty
neither
do
i
uphold
his
innocence
rejoined
carwell
but
he
is
suspected
and
he
knows
it
it
is
for
him
to
deny
such
an
accusation
his
absence
only
gives
colour
to
the
charge
therefore
i
say
until
he
refutes
his
accusers
he
must
be
out
off
from
the
congregation
of
the
just
so
say
i
brother
carwell
cried
brand
eye
for
an
eye
a
tooth
for
a
tooth
still
we
must
give
him
every
chance
let
us
then
call
a
meeting
of
our
brethren
and
demand
that
he
disprove
the
charge
or
confess
if
he
be
guiltless
the
lord
will
protect
his
own
i
do
believe
johnson
killed
bethiah
said
rachel
nor
does
herbert
oh
i
am
quite
neutral
interposed
mayne
hastily
i
am
neither
for
nor
against
our
pastor
though
i
grant
you
it
was
strange
that
i
should
have
met
him
where
i
did
on
the
very
night
of
the
disappearance
no
more
strange
than
that
you
should
have
been
there
yourself
surely
well
really
i
suppose
you
do
mean
to
infer
that
i
had
anything
to
do
with
the
girl
disappearance
i
hardly
knew
her
any
converse
i
had
with
her
was
in
your
presence
rachel
is
not
accusing
you
mayne
said
brand
coldly
but
she
is
zealous
in
support
of
her
pastor
which
does
her
nothing
but
credit
i
trust
her
zeal
may
not
prove
to
be
misplaced
we
must
hope
for
the
best
do
you
believe
in
johnson
guilt
asked
rachel
sharply
i
neither
believe
nor
disbelieve
replied
korah
after
a
pause
i
know
certain
facts
which
are
suspicious
and
with
these
i
will
tax
him
when
he
is
before
us
on
his
trial
i
will
see
the
elders
at
once
said
farmer
carwell
no
time
shall
be
lost
in
giving
johnson
an
opportunity
of
clearing
himself
let
us
hope
that
god
in
his
mercy
will
avert
disgrace
from
our
fold
amen
to
that
cried
brand
surely
the
lord
will
judge
in
all
righteousness
he
knoweth
the
sheep
from
the
goats
johnson
is
not
a
goat
said
rachel
in
all
seriousness
meanwhile
jeremiah
slade
relieved
for
the
time
being
from
official
duty
had
gone
home
to
his
meal
now
that
brand
had
told
him
how
johnson
confessed
to
the
fact
of
his
debts
being
paid
he
was
quite
confident
as
to
his
guilt
the
girl
had
been
murdered
near
carwell
field
and
her
body
hidden
in
it
near
that
field
johnson
had
on
the
night
of
the
girl
death
been
met
much
agitated
the
pearls
had
been
stolen
from
the
dead
and
the
minister
debts
had
been
paid
since
that
time
finally
there
was
the
cord
used
to
strangle
the
wretched
girl
which
had
clearly
been
taken
from
the
pastor
study
all
this
pointed
conclusively
to
johnson
guilt
and
slade
had
almost
made
up
his
mind
to
arrest
him
in
the
hope
however
of
discovering
some
final
and
absolutely
irrefutable
piece
of
evidence
he
decided
to
wait
until
he
should
have
made
a
careful
examination
of
the
spot
where
the
body
was
found
he
could
then
but
only
then
move
with
certainty
as
to
the
result
he
felt
confident
of
success
and
it
was
with
a
rosy
vision
of
himself
as
a
inspector
at
poldew
that
slade
entered
his
home
seated
by
the
kitchen
fire
he
found
his
wife
in
tears
at
sight
of
her
husband
these
gave
way
to
rage
furious
with
passion
she
jumped
up
to
meet
him
apparently
something
serious
had
occurred
they
are
back
again
you
wretch
shrieked
the
little
woman
i
have
seen
them
myself
how
dare
you
look
me
in
the
face

crazy
jemima
growled
slade
angry
and
astonished
come

come
to
me
that

it
oh

and
your
zara

so
it
them
confounded
gipsies
again
is
it
yes
it
is
they
are
back
she
is
back
the
constable
sat
down
heavily
he
looked
anything
but
comfortable
what
he
said
nervously
you
do
tell
me
that
pharaoh
tribe
come
back
as
if
you
did
know
you
villain
i
went
on
to
the
common
myself
after
the
funeral
i
heard
as
they
were
there
and
sure
enough
i
saw
them
yes
she

after
you
nonsense
do
i
tell
you
i
care
nothing
for
the
zara
girl
ai

your
lawful
husband
ai
i
tryin
to
get
you
to
poldew
what
zara
lovell
to
me
that
just
what
i
like
to
know
perhaps
mayne
can
tell
me
something
about
that
any
way
i
ask
him
better
ask
the
girl
herself
sneered
slade
wonder
you
did
i
did
see
her
you
did
see
her
repeated
slade
with
a
sense
of
relief
ah
perhaps
she
ai
there
whether
she
there
or
whether
she
ai
you
come
straight
from
your
business
every
night
or
i
know
the
reason
why
jeremiah
oh
i
come
straight
home
like
all
women
you
making
a
row
about
nothing
how
am
i
going
to
find
out
all
about
this
murder
if
you
worry
me
this
way
anything
fresh
asked
slade
her
curiosity
getting
the
better
of
her
temper
nothing
since
the
cord
jemima
but
i
going
to
examine
the
place
where
the
body
was
hidden
maybe
there
something
there
that
been
overlooked
near
pharaoh
lee
camp
ai
it
jeremiah
oh
confound
it
jemima
you
got
that
girl
on
the
brain
i
only
hope
you
have
said
slade
screwing
up
her
mouth
you
deceive
me
jeremiah
and
i
tell
chard
all
that
you
found
out
spoil
my
case
will
you
you
i
do
care
you
never
get
to
poldew
then
i
stay
here
snapped
jemima
with
all
the
recklessness
of
a
woman
prepared
to
sacrifice
anything
and
everything
to
gain
her
end
if
i
see
you
speaking
to
that
slut
zara
i
go
straight
to
chard
so
now
you
know
slade
did
know
as
he
also
knew
that
even
though
it
were
to
ruin
them
both
she
would
carry
out
her
threat
he
spent
the
best
part
of
his
trying
to
explain
his
position
and
to
pacify
the
perturbed
jemima
he
succeeded
only
in
rendering
her
more
unreasonable
and
jealous
than
ever
slade
was
nothing
if
not
feminine
and
her
argumentative
tactics
were
strikingly
so
so
soon
as
one
position
she
took
up
was
assailed
and
destroyed
she
retreated
to
another
until
beaten
on
that
she
returned
to
her
initial
standpoint
fearful
lest
she
should
drive
him
through
sheer
exasperation
to
use
physical
violence
slade
left
the
house
when
he
banged
the
door
jemima
sat
down
victorious
and
proceeded
to
twist
up
her
hair
which
had
broken
loose
in
her
excitement
zara
indeed
she
went
on
viciously
to
herself
i
tear
the
eyes
out
of
her
if
i
catch
her
as
much
as
looking
at
my
and
in
this
strain
the
good
lady
continued
until
she
was
tired
meanwhile
jeremiah
chafing
with
anger
at
his
wife
and
at
women
in
general
went
on
his
beat
which
for
the
day
happened
to
be
on
the
beach
road
he
noticed
a
new
vessel
anchored
in
the
harbour
a
graceful
schooner
of
some
tons
she
was
a
craft
smart
and
workmanlike
in
appearance
and
slade
giving
way
to
his
curiosity
for
the
moment
strolled
down
to
the
jetty
on
the
chance
of
hearing
something
about
her
but
before
he
got
that
far
a
boat
with
two
or
three
men
in
her
put
off
from
the
schooner
she
reached
the
pier
about
the
same
time
as
the
policeman
to
his
surprise
he
saw
that
one
of
the
men
in
the
boat
was
finland
the
young
mate
sprang
lightly
up
the
steps
followed
more
soberly
by
a
small
man
hullo
messmate
said
jack
greeting
slade
whom
he
knew
here
i
am
again
and
yonder
is
my
new
ship
the
ai
she
a
clipper
pretty
enough
said
slade
who
was
grudging
of
his
praise
but
a
bit
too
slight
in
the
build
for
my
taste
stuff
what
does
a
lubber
like
you
know
of
a
craft
why
she
going
round
the
horn
anyhow
on
her
way
to
the
south
seas
i
just
dropped
in
here
to
say
to
my
uncle
i
first
mate
this
trip
and
my
skipper
captain
shackel
slade
eyed
the
small
man
thoughtfully
he
had
some
skill
in
reading
a
face
and
he
concluded
that
the
skipper
was
about
the
last
man
he
would
care
to
trust
in
truth
jacob
shackel
was
not
prepossessing
he
had
a
mean
little
face
as
brown
and
wrinkled
as
a
and
hardly
larger
his
body
was
shrivelled
up
in
a
suit
of
blue
serge
apparently
several
sizes
too
large
for
him
his
voice
was
screechy
and
effeminate
he
extended
a
claw
in
greeting
to
slade
yes
i
captain
jacob
i
am
said
he
winking
his
one
eye
for
he
was
possessed
of
only
a
single
optic
and
that
red
as
any
ferret
well
known
on
the
high
seas
i
am
finland
friends
is
mine
includin
i
suppose
said
jeremiah
what
the
devil
d
mean
asked
jack
with
a
frown
only
that
if
that
so
your
skipper
will
be
as
sorry
to
hear
the
news
as
you
will
news
what
about
tera
has
she
not
been
found
oh
yes
she
been
found
right
enough
found
dead
jack
started
dead
tera
dead
dead
as
a
door
nail
in
your
uncle
field
we
found
her
strangled
her
funeral
was
this
morning
hold
up
mate
said
shackel
not
unkindly
as
jack
staggered
you
fall
in
tera
dead
gasped
finland
in
horror
who
killed
her
that
just
what
we
after
findin
out
was
it
johnson
slade
looked
suspiciously
at
the
sailor
from
under
his
red
eyebrows
i
ca
answer
no
questions
said
he
by
gum
it
was
johnson
shouted
jack
i
see
it
in
your
face
the
hound
i
see
him
i
without
waiting
to
finish
his
sentence
he
ran
up
the
pier
like
a
greyhound
guess
i
better
go
too
or
there
be
more
murder
said
jacob
jack
finland
ai
the
chap
to
stick
at
no
trifles
when
he
on
the
bust
to
kill
and
with
an
activity
wonderful
for
a
man
of
his
years
he
followed
sharp
on
the
track
of
his
first
mate
slade
looked
after
the
pair
thoughtfully
he
ca
killed
the
girl
said
he
to
himself
but
he
seems
to
think
johnson
did
perhaps
i
better
follow
in
case
there
trouble
hold
on
though
i
ca
go
off
my
beat
well
i
just
have
to
trust
to
that
captain
he
lose
his
mate
through
lettin
him
commit
murder
events
fully
justified
slade
reasoning
captain
jacob
caught
up
with
finland
just
as
the
latter
was
forced
to
slacken
his
pace
to
climb
the
hill
with
much
difficulty
he
persuaded
him
to
abandon
his
intention
but
i
will
have
it
out
with
him
said
finland
fiercely
you
only
get
yourself
into
a
mess
said
jacob
soothingly
better
let
the
old
man
see
the
job
through
i
know
johnson
well
none
better
he
came
home
in
my
ship
with
the
girl
from
koiau
so
if
any
one
can
straighten
him
out
jacob
shackel
the
man
we
want
money
you
fool
you
not
get
it
from
johnson
he
as
poor
as
a
rat
you
lie
low
and
dry
up
sonny
i
guess
i
can
engineer
this
job
without
you
sticking
your
oar
in
go
and
see
your
uncle
and
get
all
you
can
out
of
him
your
father
in
charge
this
trip
get
along
then
grumbled
jack
ungraciously
but
that
johnson
a
hound
i
hammer
him
black
and
blue
if
i
catch
him
the
hypocrite
go
slow
sonny
i
do
want
to
lose
my
mate
you
shipped
for
koiau
you
know
get
yourself
into
trouble
here
and
i
up
anchor
without
you
i
guess
your
papa
as
smart
as
most
men
finland
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
turned
away
with
a
sullen
resignation
while
his
skipper
continued
his
way
up
the
hill
to
johnson
house
shackel
knew
it
almost
as
well
as
did
its
occupant
he
had
run
down
repeatedly
to
see
tera
at
grimleigh
as
he
climbed
the
hill
he
smiled
to
himself
in
a
sour
sort
of
way
he
was
evidently
well
pleased
with
his
thoughts
who
a
guessed
it
he
chuckled
and
a
parson
of
all
things
i
guess
he
have
to
light
out
for
kingdom
come
if
he
do
trade
my
way
lord
here
an
chance
of
victualing
the
barky
all
day
long
johnson
had
remained
in
his
study
in
the
deepest
despondency
he
was
astonished
and
in
no
wise
pleased
when
captain
jacob
entered
he
knew
shackel
to
have
the
worst
of
reputations
and
he
disliked
the
man
however
he
managed
to
swallow
his
repugnance
and
greeted
the
little
sailor
with
as
much
as
he
could
muster
shackel
evidently
did
not
intend
to
waste
words
he
came
straight
to
the
point
so
that
kanaka
girl
gone
he
said
smiling
largely
tera
yes
poor
soul
she
is
dead
and
buried
sighed
johnson
sadly
murdered
was
she
foully
murdered
shackel
what
did
you
do
it
for
then
inquired
the
captain
dryly
johnson
jumped
up
so
suddenly
as
to
overturn
the
chair
on
which
he
had
been
seated
oh
heavens
do
you
accuse
me
too
he
cried
in
distress
i
do
why
jacob
fastened
his
evil
eye
on
his
victim
i
know
you
killed
the
kanaka
for
them
pearls
you
liar
i
did
not
i
swear
do
swear
said
the
captain
coolly
no
good
with
me
if
ye
did
kill
the
girl
how
did
ye
get
the
pearls
i
have
got
the
pearls
said
johnson
in
a
frenzy
yah
that
wo
do
for
me
jeered
shackel
i
want
a
share
of
the
money
man
i
tell
you
i
have
not
got
the
pearls
well
said
shackel
you
are
a
square
liar
there
no
mistake
about
that
i
saw
you
myself
taking
to
a
london
jew
dealer
now
then
ananias
chapter
ix
miss
arnott
the
unfortunate
johnson
was
so
dazed
by
the
many
accusations
that
were
made
against
him
that
this
last
astonished
him
scarcely
so
much
as
it
should
have
done
he
stared
at
captain
jacob
in
blank
bewilderment
and
it
was
some
time
before
he
made
any
reply
his
silence
was
misunderstood
by
the
blackmailer
for
shackel
was
nothing
else
who
proceeded
with
his
attack
in
more
explicit
terms
i
guess
you
ai
got
brass
enough
to
tell
me
i
a
liar
said
jacob
with
a
twinkle
in
his
one
eye
when
you
came
to
me
with
that
yarn
of
tera
lighting
out
for
a
place
as
you
did
know
of
i
thought
it
was
a
bit
queer
i
could
make
out
your
game
but
i
made
up
my
mind
to
keep
an
eye
on
you
that
trip
you
came
back
here
but
two
weeks
later
you
skedaddled
to
london
that
is
perfectly
true
admitted
johnson
quietly
i
went
up
again
to
london
in
connection
with
some
debts
i
owed
oh
rats
you
went
up
about
them
pearls
let
us
waive
that
question
for
the
moment
captain
jacob
i
admit
that
i
was
in
london
two
weeks
after
my
visit
to
you
about
the
disappearance
of
bithiah
may
i
ask
how
you
knew
oh
there
ai
no
harm
in
telling
that
answered
the
captain
graciously
i
did
cotton
to
the
idea
of
the
kanaka
gal
disappearing
while
she
was
in
your
house
so
i
wanted
to
see
your
game
and
spile
it
in
the
interests
of
justice
i
dropped
a
line
to
papa
brand
as
was
hanging
out
here
and
asked
him
to
keep
an
eye
lifted
your
way
he
wired
as
you
were
going
to
london
by
a
certain
train
korah
brand
he
must
have
watched
me
you
bet
he
just
did
and
i
did
ditto
end
i
saw
you
come
out
of
victoria
station
and
follered
you
it
was
hatton
garden
as
you
made
for
and
you
sneaked
into
a
when
you
thought
no
one
was
looking
i
just
thought
to
myself
arter
the
gal
disappeared
as
be
by
way
of
sellin
them
pearls
so
i
waited
till
you
kim
out
and
dodged
in
on
my
own
hook
the
sheeny
abraham
moss
is
his
name
and
you
know
it
was
just
putting
the
pearls
back
in
the
bag
and
i
recognized
them
straight
off
what
the
pearls
impossible
well
drawled
shackel
rather
disconcerted
if
i
did
twig
the
pearls
i
knew
the
bag
was
tera
she
showed
it
to
me
when
i
brought
you
to
england
and
i
knew
the
kind
of
tattoo
mark
as
buli
put
on
it
oh
the
bag
and
pearls
were
tera
right
enough
but
i
surmise
as
you
put
the
gal
in
her
little
wooden
overcoat
no
sir
now
as
you
did
seeing
as
a
perlice
cove
says
she
was
murdered
if
i
knowed
that
cried
jacob
with
a
show
of
virtuous
wrath
yanked
you
into
quod
i
would
by
thunder
johnson
listened
to
the
man
without
moving
a
muscle
he
looked
him
calmly
in
the
face
captain
shackel
said
he
coldly
allow
me
to
inform
you
that
there
is
not
a
word
of
truth
in
the
statement
by
means
of
which
you
propose
to
blackmail
me
i
visited
london
the
first
time
to
inquire
if
you
had
seen
my
ward
who
i
thought
might
have
gone
to
you
for
shelter
you
denied
that
she
had
been
with
you
so
believing
your
statement
i
returned
to
grimleigh
two
weeks
after
her
disappearance
i
was
in
great
trouble
about
some
money
i
owed
from
some
unknown
person
i
received
my
several
bills
receipted
they
were
placed
on
this
very
desk
one
day
when
i
was
out
visiting
much
astonished
i
went
to
london
and
saw
my
creditors
to
learn
if
possible
who
had
paid
the
money
they
one
and
all
refused
to
inform
me
as
they
had
promised
my
benefactor
not
to
reveal
his
name
failing
in
this
attempt
i
returned
for
the
second
time
to
grimleigh
and
since
then
i
have
hardly
left
my
home
tera
has
been
murdered
but
i
do
not
know
who
murdered
her
i
myself
am
wholly
innocent
i
never
saw
the
pearls
after
the
night
she
disappeared
i
was
never
near
hatton
garden
i
know
nothing
of
the
pawnshop
you
mention
or
of
its
jew
owner
the
name
of
moss
is
unknown
to
me
in
short
captain
shackel
i
deny
your
accusation
jacob
in
no
wise
put
about
by
this
denial
winked
his
one
eye
and
became
vulgarly
familiar
that
right
sonny
you
stick
to
it
said
he
it
your
only
chance
of
saving
your
neck
see
here
though
you
johnson
he
added
in
a
more
threatening
tone
i
hold
you
in
the
hollow
of
my
hand
got
a
schooner
of
sorts
as
i
sailing
round
the
horn
in
to
do
trading
business
in
the
islands
it
taken
all
my
savings
to
buy
her
now
i
want
money
to
buy
stores
and
fit
her
out
properly
with
rations
for
the
voyage
that
money
i
came
here
to
get
from
you
those
pearls
were
worth
a
mint
of
coin
and
i
going
to
have
my
share
say
five
quid
pay
me
that
and
i
tie
up
my
tongue
about
your
killin
the
gal
and
sellin
her
pearls
but
you
refuse
me
my
son
and
i
guess
you
be
singing
psalms
in
quod
this
time
there
is
the
door
captain
you
can
go
and
the
minister
pale
but
firm
rose
to
dismiss
his
visitor
you
wo
part
urged
the
little
man
shuffling
to
his
feet
i
wo
pay
your
blackmail
sir
your
attempt
to
levy
it
is
i
may
remind
you
of
itself
a
criminal
offence
what
murder
then
asked
the
captain
well
i
guess
i
ai
a
hard
man
and
it
true
this
thing
come
on
you
me
and
finland
give
you
twelve
hours
to
think
about
it
finland
is
he
with
you
i
guess
so
first
mate
he
was
coming
here
to
smash
you
for
murdering
his
sweetheart
but
i
sent
him
off
to
his
uncle
carwell
and
come
myself
in
his
place
being
well
what
to
be
done
nothing
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
you
can
go
twelve
hours
my
son
threatened
the
captain
making
for
the
door
it
either
five
hundred
pounds
to
me
or
gaol
and
the
gallows
for
you
figure
it
out
your
own
way
and
the
wrinkled
embodiment
of
evil
left
the
room
with
the
utmost
nonchalance
evidently
captain
jacob
was
satisfied
that
the
game
was
in
his
own
hands
left
to
himself
johnson
gave
himself
up
to
a
survey
of
his
position
he
was
almost
in
despair
this
was
not
the
first
disagreeable
interview
through
which
he
had
gone
that
day
for
before
the
funeral
brand
had
been
with
him
urging
him
to
flight
in
his
desire
to
save
johnson
and
avert
disgrace
from
bethgamul
korah
had
broken
his
promise
to
slade
and
had
related
the
discovery
of
the
stolen
curtain
cord
a
silken
rope
had
been
taken
from
the
study
a
silken
rope
had
been
used
to
strangle
tera
were
these
one
and
the
same
it
certainly
seemed
so
who
could
have
stolen
it
who
could
have
committed
the
murder
johnson
was
strong
in
the
consciousness
of
his
own
innocence
and
he
was
sustained
by
his
belief
in
the
justice
of
god
yet
the
evidence
against
him
was
so
explicit
that
he
could
not
but
see
how
difficult
it
would
be
to
extricate
himself
from
the
position
in
which
he
was
placed
he
had
been
near
the
field
the
very
night
on
which
tera
had
been
killed
there
his
debts
had
been
paid
by
some
person
whom
he
could
not
even
name
the
cord
used
to
strangle
the
girl
had
been
taken
from
his
study
and
public
opinion
was
dead
against
him
as
the
actual
criminal
the
wretched
man
knew
not
how
best
to
combat
this
evil
how
to
disprove
this
evidence
he
felt
that
he
was
in
a
net
the
meshes
of
which
were
gradually
closing
round
him
it
was
better
perhaps
to
adopt
brand
suggestion
and
fly
lest
worse
should
befall
it
is
friendly
advice
said
johnson
to
himself
with
a
groan
yet
dare
i
accept
it
after
all
how
do
i
know
that
brand
is
my
friend
if
he
were
a
true
friend
he
would
hardly
spy
on
me
on
shackel
behalf
this
suggested
flight
may
be
but
a
snare
to
make
me
inculpate
myself
and
the
selling
of
the
pearls
how
can
i
show
that
i
did
not
sell
them
i
was
in
london
shackel
swears
that
he
saw
me
enter
abraham
moss
shop
the
murderer
must
have
been
disguised
as
myself
in
order
to
throw
the
guilt
on
my
shoulders
what
can
i
do
tell
all
these
things
to
chard
no
then
i
stand
in
immediate
danger
of
arrest
and
i
can
offer
no
defence
fly
by
doing
that
i
make
a
tacit
acknowledgment
of
guilt
o
god
in
thy
mercy
inspire
me
with
some
plan
of
action
tera
honour
good
name
all
gone
and
now
my
life
is
in
danger
what
shall
i
do
to
help
myself
he
paced
up
and
down
the
narrow
room
in
a
frenzy
of
anguish
and
futile
thought
then
growing
calmer
he
determined
to
question
his
mother
as
to
tera
movements
and
behaviour
on
the
night
she
disappeared
it
might
be
that
the
girl
had
had
some
enemy
of
whom
he
knew
nothing
she
might
perchance
have
let
fall
some
word
which
if
followed
up
might
be
likely
to
elucidate
the
mystery
of
her
terrible
death
in
any
case
there
was
a
chance
that
his
mother
might
know
something
which
would
prove
of
use
to
help
him
a
drowning
man
will
clutch
at
a
straw
johnson
in
his
state
of
distraction
looked
on
his
mother
as
that
straw
he
went
to
look
for
her
his
hope
of
her
aid
was
faint
still
it
was
a
hope
and
that
was
something
mother
he
said
as
he
watched
her
peeling
potatoes
i
want
you
to
tell
me
what
bithiah
did
on
the
night
she
disappeared
johnson
looked
up
querulously
the
name
of
the
murdered
girl
disturbed
her
and
she
gave
a
pious
moan
such
as
she
sometimes
gave
vent
to
in
chapel
when
moved
by
the
words
of
the
sermon
bithiah
george
oh
do
talk
of
her
she
has
gone
into
outer
darkness
and
i
am
not
quite
satisfied
about
her
soul
the
misery
had
over
that
poor
heathen
you
would
believe
bithiah
was
not
a
heathen
mother
but
a
christian
duly
received
into
the
fold
but
tell
me
what
did
bithiah
do
on
that
evening
nothing
more
than
usual
replied
johnson
with
another
moan
she
was
mostly
in
her
bedroom
attending
to
her
clothes
i
was
quite
angry
at
her
george
indeed
i
was
for
the
supper
was
behind
and
she
would
not
help
indeed
no
after
leaving
her
room
she
sat
in
the
parlour
like
a
fine
lady
talking
to
miss
arnott
what
cried
johnson
seizing
on
this
admission
was
miss
arnott
here
on
that
evening
did
i
tell
you
george
no
of
course
i
did
miss
arnott
asked
me
not
to
as
she
did
not
wish
you
to
know
about
her
quarrel
with
bithiah
you
amaze
me
mother
why
should
miss
arnott
quarrel
in
my
house
ah
moaned
johnson
wagging
her
head
over
a
potato
why
indeed
but
the
heart
of
man
and
likewise
woman
is
bad
and
wicked
miss
arnott
and
bithiah
quarrelled
over
you
my
son
johnson
looked
at
his
mother
in
amazement
quarrelled
over
me
he
said
blankly
they
both
loved
you
a
bitter
smile
curved
the
minister
lips
at
least
bithiah
did
not
he
said
nonsense
replied
johnson
why
she
even
struck
miss
arnott
out
of
love
for
you
i
am
glad
she
gone
but
i
sorry
she
dead
i
could
not
have
my
son
marry
a
heathen
besides
she
was
most
careless
about
housekeeping
too
you
much
better
marry
miss
arnott
george
she
not
young
but
she
both
rich
and
godly
she
hated
bithiah
johnson
waited
to
hear
no
more
but
returned
to
his
study
miss
arnott
loved
him
she
hated
bithiah
these
words
rang
in
his
ears
a
fresh
thought
was
born
of
them
which
he
at
first
refused
to
entertain
but
it
forced
itself
upon
him
it
formed
itself
into
a
question
into
a
series
of
questions
had
miss
arnott
followed
and
strangled
bithiah
was
it
miss
arnott
who
had
concealed
the
girl
body
in
the
field
she
had
frequently
been
in
his
study
she
had
quarrelled
with
bithiah
on
the
very
night
of
the
latter
disappearance
so
she
might
have
stolen
the
cord
and
killed
tera
she
was
an
actress
once
muttered
johnson
and
in
spite
of
grace
she
may
have
yielded
to
temptation
but
no
he
shuddered
even
if
the
woman
does
love
me
she
would
not
have
lost
her
soul
by
murder
to
put
an
end
to
this
new
doubt
with
which
he
was
battling
johnson
made
up
his
mind
to
call
on
miss
arnott
since
the
rumours
against
him
had
been
rife
in
the
town
he
had
been
shy
of
going
out
but
in
this
instance
there
was
no
need
for
him
to
go
far
miss
arnott
was
his
next
door
neighbour
and
a
very
few
steps
would
bring
him
to
her
door
only
a
broken
fence
of
slabs
divided
her
garden
from
his
and
there
was
really
no
need
for
him
to
step
outside
the
boundary
of
his
own
grounds
however
he
determined
to
pay
his
call
with
due
ceremony
and
putting
on
his
tall
hat
he
stepped
out
of
his
own
gate
and
through
that
of
miss
arnott
the
whilom
actress
was
a
tall
and
stately
woman
she
had
been
beautiful
and
was
even
now
not
without
some
remains
of
her
early
beauty
her
figure
was
still
shapely
and
graceful
not
even
the
somewhat
formless
garments
she
now
wore
could
hide
completely
the
curves
of
her
figure
in
truth
she
was
but
forty
years
of
age
although
her
life
of
rigorous
asceticism
and
made
her
look
much
older
her
eyes
were
large
and
dark
wonderfully
eloquent
in
expression
there
was
no
mistaking
the
look
of
devotion
with
which
they
fixed
themselves
on
johnson
as
he
was
shown
into
her
this
is
indeed
an
honour
said
she
giving
him
her
hand
with
much
grace
pray
sit
down
johnson
you
must
have
some
tea
no
thank
you
replied
the
minister
who
felt
rather
uncomfortable
in
her
presence
i
have
come
to
talk
seriously
miss
arnott
is
this
a
duty
call
as
a
pastor
asked
the
woman
biting
her
lip
have
you
come
to
talk
religion
to
me
i
have
come
to
talk
about
bithiah
miss
arnott
thin
hands
clenched
themselves
on
her
lap
and
she
flashed
an
anxious
glance
on
her
visitor
about
that
poor
murdered
heathen
yes
about
tera
although
she
was
no
heathen
do
you
know
miss
arnott
that
i
am
accused
of
having
murdered
her
i
have
heard
the
lie
said
miss
arnott
with
quiet
scorn
but
i
need
hardly
tell
you
that
i
do
not
believe
it
thank
you
my
mother
tells
me
that
you
saw
bithiah
shortly
before
she
left
the
house
i
fancied
she
might
have
said
something
in
your
presence
likely
to
throw
light
perhaps
on
the
darkness
of
this
mystery
miss
arnott
flushed
through
her
sallow
skin
but
kept
her
black
eyes
on
the
minister
i
asked
your
mother
to
say
nothing
about
that
meeting
she
remarked
angrily
bithiah
acted
like
the
savage
she
was
i
know
she
did
miss
arnott
and
i
am
deeply
sorry
to
know
it
it
was
of
course
because
the
poor
girl
passions
were
those
of
a
partially
uncivilized
being
that
she
so
far
forgot
herself
as
to
strike
you
she
did
strike
me
said
miss
arnott
drawing
a
long
breath
struck
me
and
tore
the
from
my
left
ear
it
was
a
ring
of
gold
and
her
hand
or
sleeve
caught
in
it
so
roughly
that
the
clasp
gave
way
my
ear
bled
from
her
savage
attack
i
am
deeply
grieved
said
johnson
horrified
at
this
instance
of
tera
savage
nature
but
as
i
have
said
she
was
but
half
civilized
she
was
sufficiently
civilized
to
steal
my
however
retorted
miss
arnott
i
never
got
it
back
i
must
see
to
that
what
did
you
quarr
johnson
stopped
suddenly
for
he
remembered
what
his
mother
had
said
was
the
cause
of
the
quarrel
we
quarrelled
about
you
said
miss
arnott
in
a
low
voice
yes
i
can
now
acknowledge
my
love
for
you
without
shame
while
you
were
prosperous
and
popular
with
a
stainless
name
i
kept
silent
there
was
no
other
course
open
to
me
now
that
you
are
despised
and
accused
of
murder
i
can
tell
you
how
dear
you
are
to
me
if
you
had
not
come
to
me
i
should
still
have
told
you
the
minister
rose
to
his
feet
horrified
at
this
bold
and
as
it
seemed
to
him
shameless
confession
miss
arnott
he
stammered
i
i
i
can
not
listen
to
this
i
must
go
no
stay
she
cried
with
a
theatrical
gesture
i
have
some
claim
on
you
claim
on
me
replied
johnson
he
could
not
understand
her
miss
arnott
looked
at
him
steadily
it
was
i
who
paid
your
debts
she
said
chapter
x
a
fresh
piece
of
evidence
johnson
made
no
further
attempt
to
leave
he
sat
down
again
he
was
too
much
taken
aback
to
speak
yet
mechanically
he
repeated
the
words
of
miss
arnott
as
if
the
more
clearly
to
convey
their
meaning
to
his
mind
you
paid
my
debts
for
what
reason
may
i
ask
because
i
love
you
how
did
you
know
that
i
owed
money
inquired
the
minister
ignoring
the
confession
which
in
truth
confused
him
beyond
measure
miss
arnott
smiled
your
indebtedness
is
everybody
secret
she
replied
quietly
your
servant
found
some
accounts
which
you
carelessly
left
lying
about
and
as
servants
will
she
talked
about
them
freely
i
could
not
but
hear
something
of
this
gossip
in
fact
i
heard
you
were
in
difficulties
i
wondered
how
best
i
could
help
you
i
decided
that
the
first
thing
to
do
was
to
obtain
a
list
of
your
liabilities
without
your
knowledge
of
course
why
so
had
you
spoken
openly
to
me
you
would
not
have
accepted
my
help
oh
believe
me
i
know
your
proud
nature
not
even
your
devotional
life
has
had
any
effect
upon
that
at
least
you
would
have
wanted
to
know
my
reason
for
wishing
to
help
you
and
that
i
could
not
have
given
you
at
that
time
for
you
stood
well
with
the
world
then
i
can
tell
it
to
you
now
in
one
word
love
my
love
for
you
the
love
of
one
christian
for
another
i
hope
no
it
is
not
miss
arnott
struck
her
breast
theatrically
her
whole
attitude
now
was
reminiscent
of
her
early
profession
it
is
the
love
of
a
woman
for
a
man
the
passion
which
once
in
her
lifetime
is
born
in
the
breast
of
every
mortal
woman
ay
and
of
every
man
it
is
no
artificial
creation
of
christianity
you
speak
wickedly
said
the
minister
agitated
and
shocked
i
speak
humanly
as
a
woman
whose
life
happiness
is
at
stake
do
not
misunderstand
me
johnson
i
joined
your
denomination
knowing
full
well
that
it
was
for
the
salvation
of
my
immortal
soul
i
was
called
to
grace
and
i
left
my
life
of
amusement
and
worldly
vanities
but
the
old
leaven
is
here
here
and
she
struck
her
breast
again
for
ten
years
have
i
laboured
to
erase
the
evil
of
my
past
life
but
i
have
laboured
in
vain
when
i
saw
you
i
i
loved
you
even
my
faith
seemed
as
nothing
then
beside
the
hope
of
becoming
your
wife
your
wife
your
wife
let
me
say
it
you
came
between
me
and
my
creator
try
as
i
would
to
banish
you
from
my
thoughts
in
vain
in
vain
all
in
vain
were
my
prayers
nature
was
nature
is
too
strong
for
me
i
love
you
i
love
you
let
all
else
go
miss
arnott
i
really
can
not
listen
to
this
said
johnson
her
absolute
abandonment
scandalized
and
pained
him
he
rose
to
go
sit
down
she
said
imperiously
we
must
understand
each
other
first
then
let
us
discuss
your
position
and
see
how
best
you
can
escape
the
danger
which
threatens
you
i
may
be
able
to
help
you
i
do
think
so
johnson
shook
his
head
despondently
nevertheless
he
resumed
his
seat
we
shall
see
a
woman
wit
can
oftentimes
achieve
more
than
a
logic
that
order
for
women
to
be
silent
was
a
mistake
on
the
part
of
paul
nine
men
out
of
ten
owe
what
is
best
in
their
lives
to
the
advice
of
their
wives
or
their
mothers
tell
me
how
matters
stand
with
you
believe
me
i
am
glad
to
make
you
my
confidante
miss
arnott
god
knows
i
need
a
friend
i
am
your
friend
more
than
your
friend
have
i
not
proved
at
least
my
desire
for
your
welfare
trivial
perhaps
of
itself
my
action
in
paying
your
bills
shows
that
it
was
i
who
placed
the
receipts
on
your
study
table
johnson
looked
up
quickly
then
it
was
you
who
took
away
the
bills
it
was
i
rejoined
miss
arnott
composedly
what
else
could
i
do
it
was
necessary
that
i
should
have
a
list
of
your
creditors
so
i
watched
at
your
window
to
see
where
you
left
your
accounts
i
came
through
the
fence
which
divides
your
house
from
mine
you
know
it
is
broken
in
several
parts
then
it
was
your
footsteps
i
heard
it
was
johnson
i
saw
you
looking
at
the
pearls
and
your
accounts
i
feared
lest
in
your
great
stress
you
might
be
tempted
to
sell
that
girl
treasure
i
determined
to
have
those
bills
on
hearing
my
step
you
came
out
and
left
them
on
the
table
yes
i
did
but
i
could
not
see
you
of
course
not
the
moment
i
saw
you
move
i
stepped
back
into
my
own
grounds
you
replaced
the
pearls
in
the
bag
when
you
looked
round
i
was
behind
the
fence
watching
you
then
when
i
saw
you
go
out
and
into
the
street
i
seized
my
opportunity
i
ran
in
quickly
and
took
the
bills
i
copied
the
names
and
addresses
of
your
creditors
with
the
amounts
owing
to
each
and
a
day
or
so
later
i
restored
the
accounts
during
your
absence
then
i
went
to
london
and
paid
every
one
of
them
your
creditors
one
and
all
promised
me
absolute
silence
and
one
day
i
watched
my
opportunity
and
placed
the
receipts
on
your
desk
he
looked
gloomily
at
the
woman
she
seemed
to
attach
but
little
importance
to
what
she
had
done
there
was
nothing
theatrical
about
her
now
she
told
it
quite
simply
he
kept
looking
at
her
you
have
done
me
a
kindness
he
said
and
i
thank
you
for
it
but
by
doing
it
you
have
unconsciously
added
to
the
difficulties
of
my
position
it
is
known
that
my
debts
have
been
paid
i
am
suspected
of
having
stolen
bithiah
pearls
in
order
to
pay
them
how
am
i
to
repudiate
this
easily
enough
i
can
tell
the
congregation
of
bethgamul
what
i
have
told
you
that
may
exonerate
me
in
part
miss
arnott
but
i
shall
be
severely
censured
by
the
congregation
for
having
accepted
monetary
aid
from
a
woman
a
stranger
so
to
speak
there
are
two
answers
to
that
replied
miss
arnott
quietly
in
the
first
place
i
aided
you
without
your
knowledge
in
the
second
you
have
only
to
tell
the
congregation
that
i
am
your
promised
wife
and
no
one
of
them
can
say
a
word
johnson
became
agitated
i
can
not
say
that
you
are
my
promised
wife
he
said
i
can
not
lie
to
them
why
need
it
be
a
lie
can
you
not
marry
me
but
but
i
do
not
love
you
you
must
learn
to
love
me
such
a
passion
as
mine
surely
deserves
some
return
you
would
not
be
the
most
ungrateful
of
men
have
i
not
done
my
best
to
serve
you
i
did
not
ask
you
to
you
and
i
alone
know
that
johnson
no
one
else
does
if
i
choose
to
confess
the
truth
to
the
congregation
you
will
be
exonerated
if
i
say
you
accepted
my
help
wittingly
and
willingly
there
is
nothing
for
you
to
do
but
to
amend
your
position
by
saying
that
i
am
to
marry
you
miss
arnott
you
place
me
in
a
most
difficult
position
be
just
i
also
show
you
the
way
out
of
it
a
way
i
can
not
i
dare
not
take
said
the
minister
desperately
then
the
woman
passion
got
the
better
of
her
she
rose
furious
yet
you
dare
to
slight
me
you
reject
my
love
which
has
saved
you
from
disgrace
oh
i
know
well
that
you
loved
bithiah
that
wretched
heathen
creature
but
she
is
dead
and
i
am
glad
that
she
is
dead
for
now
there
can
be
no
hope
for
your
mad
passion
you
must
forget
her
you
must
marry
me
you
shall
marry
me
i
will
not
said
johnson
rising
in
his
turn
and
speaking
every
word
distinctly
you
overstep
the
bounds
of
modesty
miss
arnott
i
do
not
love
you
i
never
could
love
you
my
heart
is
buried
in
the
grave
of
tera
the
woman
turned
pale
and
sank
back
into
her
chair
then
is
all
my
wickedness
in
vain
she
moaned
what
do
you
mean
asked
the
minister
he
was
struck
by
the
peculiarity
of
the
phrase
you
know
well
what
i
mean
i
have
fought
that
woman
for
you
and
she
has
beaten
me
once
she
was
out
of
the
way
i
thought
i
could
win
you
for
myself
it
seems
i
was
wrong
yet
what
can
you
do
without
me
your
good
name
is
gone
you
are
suspected
of
murdering
the
girl
of
robbing
her
and
of
paying
your
debts
with
the
wages
of
your
sin
do
you
think
the
congregation
will
keep
you
as
preacher
no
you
will
be
cast
out
of
the
fold
you
will
be
disgraced
and
penniless
where
will
you
go
what
will
you
do
without
a
name
without
money
i
am
rich
i
can
save
you
but
you
refuse
my
help
god
will
help
me
said
johnson
moving
towards
the
door
he
knows
i
am
innocent
will
god
help
me
cried
miss
arnott
wildly
he
knows
that
i
am
not
innocent
go
go
leave
me
to
reap
the
harvest
of
my
folly
i
have
loved
you
too
well
and
this
this
is
my
reward
leave
me
i
say
go
she
looked
so
furious
yet
so
imperious
in
her
wrath
the
wrath
of
a
woman
scorned
that
the
minister
left
the
room
without
a
word
in
her
present
state
of
mind
it
were
idle
to
argue
with
her
deep
in
thought
johnson
returned
to
his
home
he
had
expected
this
interview
to
end
differently
most
assuredly
he
had
not
anticipated
that
the
element
of
love
would
so
have
dominated
it
miss
arnott
mad
passion
her
quarrel
with
the
dead
girl
her
payment
of
his
debts
all
these
things
perplexed
him
sorely
he
knew
not
what
to
think
of
them
the
knowledge
that
he
was
so
attractive
to
this
woman
gave
him
no
pleasure
on
the
contrary
rather
did
it
cause
him
to
shudder
to
wince
as
at
the
contact
of
evil
i
must
release
myself
from
this
snare
he
murmured
to
himself
and
that
can
only
be
done
by
paying
back
this
money
yet
where
am
i
to
get
five
hundred
pounds
i
am
hampered
on
all
sides
if
i
do
not
bribe
this
shackel
he
will
accuse
me
of
selling
poor
tera
pearls
already
i
am
suspected
of
her
murder
every
one
is
working
against
me
it
is
best
perhaps
to
follow
brand
suggestion
and
fly
here
i
may
be
arrested
at
any
moment
the
position
was
terrible
he
did
not
see
his
way
out
of
it
at
all
the
more
he
thought
the
more
perplexed
and
confused
he
became
at
length
he
seized
his
hat
and
went
out
in
the
hope
that
fresh
air
and
rapid
motion
would
clear
his
brain
knowing
how
unpopular
he
was
he
kept
away
from
the
town
and
climbed
the
hill
by
the
lonely
path
here
in
his
meditation
he
jostled
against
a
man
coming
the
opposite
way
the
stranger
was
tall
slender
and
as
brown
as
tera
had
been
but
those
keen
black
eyes
and
that
nose
could
belong
only
to
a
romany
having
seen
him
before
johnson
had
no
difficulty
in
recognizing
the
man
pharaoh
lee
said
the
minister
stopping
in
his
surprise
i
did
not
know
you
were
here
i
with
my
people
on
the
common
yonder
replied
pharaoh
gloomily
we
came
back
the
other
day
rye
and
on
no
very
pleasant
errand
either
i
am
sorry
to
hear
that
pharaoh
what
is
the
matter
a
woman
is
the
matter
as
usual
d
remember
zara
lovell
rye
yes
she
was
to
marry
you
are
you
now
husband
and
wife
pharaoh
brow
grew
black
and
he
muttered
a
gipsy
oath
we
never
be
husband
and
wife
in
this
life
rye
whatever
we
may
be
in
the
next
he
said
bitterly
zara
fell
in
love
with
one
of
your
gentile
mashers
here
and
has
gone
back
to
him
who
is
he
i
wish
i
knew
cried
lee
fiercely
i
knife
him
hush
hush
rebuked
johnson
shivering
at
the
thought
of
another
murder
you
must
not
speak
like
that
it
is
dangerous
not
always
rye
why
some
gorgio
cove
killed
a
girl
here
the
other
day
they
tell
me
and
he
has
not
been
caught
i
dare
say
she
deceived
him
are
you
talking
of
bithiah
i
do
know
what
the
name
is
but
her
body
was
found
in
a
cornfield
that
was
the
body
of
my
ward
bithiah
explained
johnson
sadly
you
must
remember
her
pharaoh
a
dark
handsome
girl
job
cried
the
gipsy
smiting
his
thigh
it
comes
to
me
now
she
was
like
the
gentle
romany
in
looks
so
it
her
rye
is
it
and
why
did
he
kill
her
who
the
man
as
did
it
she
deceived
him
i
do
doubt
and
he
strangled
her
you
are
wrong
pharaoh
it
was
no
love
tragedy
how
bithiah
came
by
her
death
no
one
knows
but
i
beg
of
you
not
to
let
this
terrible
crime
form
a
precedent
in
your
dealing
with
zara
where
is
she
now
i
do
know
said
lee
becoming
sullen
again
i
was
up
north
and
asked
her
to
marry
me
over
the
poker
and
tongs
as
we
been
vowed
for
months
to
one
another
then
she
told
me
of
her
marriage
in
the
gentile
way
with
a
gorgio
i
tried
to
get
his
name
out
of
her
but
she
knew
how
ready
my
knife
would
be
and
refused
to
tell
me
in
the
night
she
ran
away
and
as
i
guessed
she
come
back
here
to
her
husband
i
moved
my
people
down
as
quick
as
i
could
here
i
am
but
where
zara
is
i
do
know
curses
on
her
and
him
hush
do
not
swear
lee
who
is
this
man
i
do
know
have
you
any
idea
as
to
who
he
is
yes
it
either
a
man
called
slade
or
another
mayne
by
name
they
were
always
hanging
round
our
camp
when
we
were
here
last
and
zara
was
with
them
oftener
than
i
liked
i
believe
it
one
or
the
other
no
pharaoh
you
must
be
wrong
slade
the
policeman
has
been
married
for
quite
a
year
and
although
mayne
is
still
a
bachelor
it
is
probable
that
he
will
make
miss
carwell
his
wife
so
you
see
it
can
be
neither
of
these
who
can
swear
to
that
retorted
lee
you
gorgios
make
nothing
of
deceiving
our
we
are
not
of
your
race
and
your
laws
are
not
for
us
if
zara
is
not
married
to
one
of
the
two
gentiles
i
speak
of
they
know
who
she
is
married
to
they
can
tell
me
if
they
choose
and
i
shall
force
them
to
speak
out
added
the
gipsy
fiercely
when
i
know
the
truth
i
lee
i
implore
you
to
do
nothing
rash
i
shall
mend
my
honour
in
my
own
way
rye
it
is
an
oath
with
this
dramatic
declaration
on
his
lips
lee
swung
off
down
the
hill
to
escape
further
reproof
and
entreaty
johnson
knowing
the
fierce
nature
of
the
wanderer
looked
after
him
with
an
air
of
doubt
when
pharaoh
evil
passions
were
roused
he
struck
at
once
swift
and
true
as
a
wounded
snake
it
seemed
as
if
tera
murder
were
to
be
followed
by
another
and
johnson
sighed
as
he
thought
of
all
that
had
happened
so
suddenly
to
trouble
the
hitherto
current
of
his
life
since
he
had
fallen
in
love
with
tera
there
had
been
nothing
but
trouble
and
he
could
not
see
how
or
where
it
was
all
to
end
and
hopeless
of
aid
the
minister
resumed
his
upward
way
and
shortly
reached
the
brow
of
the
hill
where
the
stretched
towards
poldew
unconsciously
his
feet
had
led
him
into
the
very
path
along
which
bithiah
must
have
passed
to
her
mysterious
death
the
omen
chilled
him
for
the
moment
but
shaking
off
the
superstition
as
incompatible
with
his
calling
as
a
teacher
he
stepped
resolutely
along
the
grassy
way
which
meandered
through
the
stubble
field
some
power
drew
him
almost
against
his
will
towards
the
fatal
spot
as
he
walked
along
he
caught
sight
of
a
burly
figure
bending
down
in
the
field
as
he
approached
he
recognized
jeremiah
slade
knowing
neither
the
man
ambitions
nor
the
interest
he
took
in
the
case
johnson
wondered
what
he
was
doing
so
near
the
place
where
the
body
had
been
found
his
curiosity
being
excited
he
crossed
the
ridgy
furrows
and
walked
up
to
the
policeman
what
are
you
looking
for
slade
jeremiah
straightened
himself
and
a
light
came
into
his
dull
blue
eye
i
ai
lookin
now
said
he
cunningly
as
i
found
something
already
something
as
is
worth
the
findin
too
what
is
it
you
seem
mighty
anxious
to
know
sir
was
the
constable
reply
with
a
suspicious
glance
naturally
i
wish
to
know
anything
bearing
upon
the
fate
of
poor
bithiah
ah
grunted
slade
there
more
than
you
sir
as
wants
information
of
that
kind
but
why
are
you
so
perticler
may
i
ask
if
it
ai
no
offence
for
two
reasons
rejoined
johnson
quietly
one
is
that
i
wish
the
assassin
of
my
poor
ward
to
be
secured
and
punished
the
other
is
that
i
desire
to
clear
my
own
character
from
the
suspicion
which
has
fallen
upon
it
you
mean
sir
as
folks
suspect
you
of
the
murder
i
do
but
i
need
hardly
say
that
i
am
innocent
well
said
the
policeman
reflectively
of
course
sir
bound
to
say
that
to
save
your
own
neck
i
thought
as
you
did
it
yourself
one
time
for
there
ai
no
denyin
as
the
evidence
is
dead
against
you
but
what
i
found
now
altered
me
a
bit
really
then
you
are
good
enough
to
exonerate
me
in
your
own
mind
you
do
believe
me
guilty
said
johnson
ironically
not
as
the
principal
anyway
it
come
to
me
as
this
poor
girl
was
strangled
by
a
woman
a
woman
how
do
you
know
that
i
found
this
on
the
very
spot
where
the
girl
body
lay
and
slade
opened
his
hand
in
the
palm
lay
a
golden
which
johnson
recognized
as
miss
arnott
chapter
xi
thou
art
the
man
the
two
men
looked
at
the
slade
with
triumph
johnson
with
dismay
there
was
no
doubt
it
belonged
to
miss
arnott
he
had
frequently
seen
her
wearing
it
and
he
asked
himself
how
it
came
to
be
found
on
the
spot
where
the
body
had
lain
miss
arnott
declaration
that
tera
had
wrenched
the
from
her
ear
and
had
carried
it
away
might
be
a
mere
fiction
carried
away
as
she
was
by
her
feelings
it
was
impossible
to
rely
upon
what
she
said
if
her
statement
were
untrue
the
discovery
of
the
ornament
on
the
scene
of
the
crime
went
to
show
that
miss
arnott
had
been
on
the
spot
and
there
perhaps
during
a
struggle
with
her
victim
had
lost
the
in
a
word
this
piece
of
evidence
inculpated
her
somewhat
seriously
remembering
her
agitation
and
strange
remarks
johnson
began
to
think
that
she
had
committed
the
murder
out
of
jealousy
it
was
very
feasible
the
more
he
thought
of
it
the
more
likely
it
seemed
but
the
minister
determined
to
keep
his
suspicions
to
himself
it
was
not
for
him
on
whose
account
she
had
sinned
if
she
had
sinned
to
denounce
her
it
was
for
his
sake
she
had
broken
that
terrible
sixth
commandment
therefore
he
judged
it
right
if
not
righteous
to
deny
all
knowledge
of
the
ornament
have
you
seen
this
before
sir
asked
slade
keeping
a
watchful
eye
on
the
face
of
the
minister
no
answered
johnson
with
an
effort
to
appear
calm
i
never
saw
it
before
it
does
not
belong
to
bithiah
she
wore
no
ornaments
in
her
ears
then
it
must
be
the
property
of
some
other
woman
probably
the
woman
who
killed
her
mr
johnson
how
do
you
know
a
woman
killed
her
this
points
that
way
anyhow
i
expect
the
two
women
met
and
quarrelled
about
something
or
some
one
perhaps
they
came
to
blows
or
perhaps
while
the
murderess
was
trying
to
strangle
your
girl
she
had
this
torn
from
her
ear
but
it
evident
that
a
woman
mixed
up
in
the
matter
slade
paused
and
looked
again
at
the
ornament
it
a
gipsy
said
he
how
do
you
know
slade
the
policeman
scratched
his
head
in
some
embarrassment
a
flat
circle
of
gold
it
is
ai
it
well
sir
i
seen
a
gipsy
woman
wearing
things
of
this
sort
zara
lovell
for
instance
observed
johnson
with
sudden
inspiration
zara
lovell
stammered
slade
retreating
a
step
and
looking
anything
but
comfortable
what
do
you
know
of
her
mr
johnson
only
so
much
as
i
learned
from
lee
lee
pharaoh
lee
the
gipsy
have
you
seen
him
i
was
speaking
with
him
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
i
met
you
slade
he
is
looking
for
zara
is
she
lost
then
it
would
seem
so
pharaoh
was
to
have
married
her
but
she
told
him
that
she
was
already
married
to
some
one
in
this
neighbourhood
then
she
ran
away
from
the
gipsy
camp
thinking
she
came
on
here
to
her
husband
whoever
he
is
lee
followed
and
he
is
now
looking
for
her
slade
said
johnson
gravely
the
gipsy
declared
that
either
you
or
mayne
must
be
the
husband
of
this
girl
slade
changed
from
red
to
white
and
evaded
the
minister
eye
i
knew
zara
well
enough
a
year
ago
he
said
doggedly
and
we
had
a
liking
for
one
another
but
as
to
marriage
that
never
came
into
my
mind
i
have
a
wife
now
the
only
one
i
ever
had
and
if
she
hears
this
tale
lord
knows
what
she
do
she
never
done
talking
of
zara
as
it
is
well
and
mr
mayne
oh
he
liked
zara
too
but
i
do
think
he
intended
to
marry
her
why
he
set
on
marryin
miss
carwell
who
else
is
there
that
you
know
the
girl
was
intimate
with
the
policeman
reflectively
slipped
the
into
his
pocket
and
began
to
think
suddenly
he
started
and
slapped
his
thigh
why
i
think
of
him
before
he
cried
finland
it
finland
of
course
nonsense
said
the
minister
somewhat
sharply
for
the
mention
of
the
sailor
made
him
wince
finland
was
in
love
with
bithiah
and
what
is
the
matter
he
asked
this
question
with
some
astonishment
for
slade
with
uncouth
glee
was
performing
a
kind
of
lord
he
said
joyfully
how
plain
it
all
is
how
plain
what
is
the
murder
of
course
it
was
a
woman
killed
bithiah
or
tera
or
whatever
you
call
her
that
pretty
conclusive
well
the
woman
was
zara
what
the
gipsy
girl
pharaoh
is
looking
for
oh
he
looking
for
her
said
slade
gleefully
but
he
wo
find
her
she
made
herself
scarce
because
of
this
murder
this
is
zara
i
know
now
johnson
i
saw
a
pair
of
in
her
ears
finland
made
love
to
zara
last
year
and
she
was
dead
gone
on
him
i
expect
she
heard
of
his
goings
on
with
your
girl
and
came
back
to
make
things
hot
i
do
know
if
finland
married
her
but
if
he
did
zara
hurried
back
here
to
claim
him
as
her
husband
i
dare
say
she
met
tera
here
in
this
field
and
they
fought
over
the
man
tera
tore
the
from
zara
while
she
was
being
strangled
then
zara
hid
the
body
in
this
field
and
ran
away
it
as
clear
as
day
and
slade
danced
again
i
get
to
poldew
sure
enough
knowing
well
to
whom
the
belonged
the
minister
could
not
believe
in
zara
guilt
but
without
compromising
miss
arnott
theory
was
not
to
be
demolished
the
best
he
could
do
was
to
protest
against
it
as
being
too
fanciful
why
you
have
more
reason
to
suspect
me
he
declared
true
enough
replied
slade
but
circumstanshal
evidence
ai
good
stuff
though
i
admit
i
going
on
it
a
lot
in
suspecting
zara
the
poor
girl
was
strangled
with
my
window
i
know
all
about
that
interrupted
the
policeman
i
soon
found
that
out
but
it
do
prove
as
you
took
the
cord
yourself
i
always
had
my
doubts
seeing
it
was
taken
two
or
three
days
afore
the
murder
you
would
have
made
ready
all
that
time
i
says
to
myself
he
killed
the
girl
he
did
it
in
a
rage
so
he
would
have
prepared
the
cord
beforehand
i
did
not
kill
tera
protested
johnson
vehemently
i
never
saw
her
after
she
left
my
house
although
i
searched
for
her
round
this
field
knowing
it
was
her
favourite
walk
i
loved
her
too
well
to
injure
a
hair
of
her
head
as
to
my
debts
and
you
suspected
no
doubt
that
it
was
to
pay
them
i
killed
her
they
have
been
discharged
who
paid
there
is
no
harm
in
telling
you
that
slade
but
promise
me
to
keep
what
i
tell
you
a
secret
until
i
bid
you
speak
filled
with
curiosity
slade
gave
the
required
promise
when
informed
that
miss
arnott
was
johnson
benefactor
he
chuckled
so
significantly
as
to
bring
a
blush
to
the
pale
cheeks
of
the
minister
nevertheless
and
this
was
the
main
point
he
entertained
no
suspicion
against
the
woman
and
still
harped
on
the
probability
of
guilt
for
she
might
have
stolen
the
cord
from
your
study
said
he
eagerly
them
gipsies
are
always
stealing
things
zara
was
never
in
my
house
that
i
know
of
replied
johnson
dryly
this
declaration
rather
disconcerted
slade
but
he
rallied
under
the
blow
when
a
new
idea
struck
him
i
dare
say
that
tera
herself
took
the
cord
being
a
bright
pretty
thing
why
should
she
why
should
she
retorted
slade
it
as
broad
as
it
long
talk
as
you
like
sir
it
in
my
mind
as
zara
killed
tera
and
stole
them
pearls
johnson
reflected
this
last
remark
set
him
thinking
as
to
the
advisability
of
telling
slade
about
shackel
proposed
blackmail
the
man
seemed
intelligent
and
trustworthy
and
an
ally
would
be
invaluable
if
only
to
protect
him
from
the
machinations
of
captain
jacob
forthwith
johnson
related
to
slade
the
dilemma
in
which
he
was
placed
and
asked
for
the
policeman
advice
and
help
for
i
swear
said
he
with
all
earnestness
that
while
in
london
i
did
not
go
near
hatton
gardens
but
how
am
i
to
prove
that
difficult
answered
slade
you
give
me
a
couple
of
pounds
and
let
me
go
up
to
london
i
find
out
from
the
jew
who
sold
them
pearls
can
you
get
leave
asked
johnson
catching
at
the
idea
oh
yes
for
a
couple
of
days
or
thereabouts
then
you
go
and
as
i
am
you
shall
have
five
pounds
for
your
expenses
and
trouble
but
who
did
you
think
sold
the
pearls
it
could
not
have
been
zara
seeing
that
the
seller
was
a
man
i
tell
you
what
i
think
when
i
come
back
said
slade
doubtfully
let
us
go
to
your
house
sir
and
get
the
money
if
that
captain
comes
again
to
you
just
tell
him
as
the
matter
is
in
the
hands
of
the
police
you
wo
have
no
trouble
with
him
after
that
i
bet
subsequent
events
proved
slade
to
be
correct
johnson
gave
him
the
five
pounds
and
having
obtained
leave
for
hours
the
man
took
train
to
london
with
the
address
of
the
jew
in
his
pocket
the
day
after
his
departure
shackel
made
his
appearance
in
the
full
belief
that
johnson
would
pay
him
the
sum
he
had
demanded
when
the
minister
referred
him
to
the
police
captain
jacob
was
considerably
taken
aback
by
his
victim
daring
he
protested
loudly
told
the
police
have
yer
he
snarled
well
i
guess
i
do
want
any
of
that
kind
messing
up
my
business
you
better
straighten
out
things
my
son
and
pay
me
i
shall
not
pay
you
one
penny
answered
johnson
gaining
courage
at
the
man
manifest
desire
to
retreat
the
matter
lies
with
the
police
now
if
you
trouble
me
any
more
i
shall
give
you
in
charge
captain
jacob
one
eye
twinkled
in
a
very
evil
fashion
and
he
grew
as
red
as
his
jaundiced
complexion
would
permit
you
jail
me
will
yer
he
piped
shrilly
i
reckon
two
can
play
at
that
game
you
another
word
of
that
sort
and
out
you
go
said
the
minister
with
spirit
but
shackel
was
not
to
be
silenced
like
all
sea
captains
he
was
accustomed
to
implicit
obedience
and
thought
to
get
his
own
way
by
the
adoption
of
a
bullying
tone
but
johnson
was
not
one
of
his
sailors
and
moreover
the
vituperative
insolence
of
the
little
scoundrel
had
roused
him
so
when
captain
jacob
still
proceeded
to
hector
the
minister
picked
him
up
he
was
of
no
great
weight
and
carrying
him
out
of
the
window
dropped
him
over
the
gate
there
you
extortioner
said
johnson
loudly
that
is
your
place
come
back
here
again
and
i
hand
you
over
to
the
police
by
thunder
i
see
the
police
myself
replied
shackel
dusting
his
clothes
you
be
in
jail
afore
my
son
ay
and
i
come
and
see
ye
dance
on
nothing
with
a
hempen
cravat
round
your
darned
neck
i
johnson
waited
to
hear
no
more
but
retired
into
his
house
and
left
the
mariner
cursing
the
empty
air
until
he
grew
weary
and
took
himself
off
the
minister
quite
expected
that
the
spiteful
little
creature
would
denounce
him
to
the
police
as
the
seller
of
the
pearls
and
he
was
prepared
to
be
arrested
at
any
hour
but
either
shackel
was
not
very
sure
of
his
ground
or
was
afraid
to
come
himself
in
contact
with
the
law
of
which
he
had
a
holy
horror
he
skulked
back
to
the
schooner
without
fulfilling
his
threats
and
so
far
as
he
was
concerned
johnson
remained
in
peace
the
blow
was
not
to
come
from
shackel
that
same
evening
johnson
in
his
character
of
pastor
attended
at
bethgamul
it
was
the
weekly
gathering
when
the
members
of
the
congregation
met
to
converse
together
and
to
receive
admonition
and
advice
as
circumstances
demanded
on
this
occasion
every
member
in
grimleigh
was
in
attendance
in
obedience
to
a
fiat
from
the
elders
it
was
known
that
johnson
was
suspected
of
being
concerned
either
directly
or
indirectly
in
the
tragedy
which
had
so
recently
happened
amongst
them
and
the
congregation
expected
that
at
this
meeting
he
would
attempt
to
exonerate
himself
johnson
knew
the
position
in
which
he
stood
and
what
was
required
of
him
but
he
entered
the
chapel
resolved
to
let
things
take
their
course
if
compelled
to
defend
himself
he
would
speak
but
he
was
determined
not
to
state
his
case
voluntarily
there
were
details
in
connection
with
miss
arnott
which
he
certainly
had
no
wish
to
make
public
miss
arnott
herself
was
present
looking
haggard
and
nervous
she
felt
keenly
the
position
in
which
she
stood
towards
johnson
but
at
the
present
moment
she
did
not
see
how
to
improve
it
she
had
come
to
the
meeting
for
guidance
and
comfort
farmer
carwell
his
daughter
and
mayne
arrived
together
ready
for
an
exciting
evening
indeed
on
their
entry
into
the
chapel
they
were
definitely
promised
one
by
brand
who
met
them
at
the
door
our
pastor
has
not
yet
arrived
whispered
korah
in
his
deep
voice
but
i
have
sent
for
him
and
he
will
be
here
very
soon
then
i
shall
invite
him
to
confess
he
is
not
compelled
to
do
that
observed
rachel
who
still
held
that
in
the
absence
of
proof
the
minister
was
innocent
he
is
compelled
so
far
responded
brand
that
if
he
can
not
clear
his
character
we
shall
depose
him
from
his
office
he
shall
have
sorrow
and
wrath
with
his
sickness
if
he
owns
that
he
killed
tera
shall
you
have
him
arrested
asked
mayne
no
no
that
will
never
do
interposed
carwell
with
a
frown
we
must
not
bring
disgrace
on
bethgamul
by
our
own
act
if
the
man
is
guilty
let
him
fly
hence
and
repent
of
his
sins
he
will
not
fly
although
i
have
urged
him
groaned
korah
in
that
case
it
would
seem
he
is
innocent
said
rachel
but
here
he
comes
poor
man
how
ill
he
looks
cometh
in
with
vanity
quoted
brand
his
name
shall
be
covered
with
darkness
that
has
yet
to
be
proved
said
herbert
his
defence
of
the
minister
drew
an
approving
smile
from
rachel
johnson
did
indeed
look
as
he
stood
on
the
rostrum
under
the
yellow
glare
of
the
oil
lamp
he
gazed
down
on
the
stern
faces
of
his
people
every
countenance
was
set
like
a
flint
even
those
of
the
women
were
harder
and
more
unsympathetic
than
usual
and
he
felt
that
in
their
hearts
they
already
condemned
him
but
the
sight
of
his
old
mother
weeping
quietly
in
the
corner
brought
him
comfort
if
no
one
else
believed
in
his
innocence
she
did
brother
johnson
said
brand
rising
as
the
minister
opened
the
bible
before
you
speak
from
the
sacred
volume
we
would
know
if
you
are
worthy
to
do
so
are
your
lips
undefiled
is
your
heart
clean
within
you
yes
replied
the
minister
calmly
i
am
conscious
of
no
sin
it
is
in
gath
and
told
along
the
streets
of
ascalon
that
you
have
the
stain
of
blood
on
your
hands
the
blood
of
the
innocent
cries
out
for
judgment
against
you
who
dares
to
say
such
a
thing
brother
korah
i
do
unworthy
as
i
am
brand
stretched
out
his
arm
brother
johnson
you
are
a
pastor
of
the
lord
sheep
and
he
committed
a
lamb
to
your
charge
that
lamb
is
slain
and
it
is
cried
aloud
that
you
are
the
slayer
in
the
tents
of
israel
it
is
spoken
your
carnal
love
drove
bithiah
of
koiau
from
your
dwelling
and
in
her
footsteps
you
followed
to
smite
and
slay
her
for
the
love
of
gold
as
nathan
the
prophet
stood
before
david
so
i
stand
before
you
as
nathan
the
prophet
said
unto
the
king
so
say
i
unto
you
art
the
man
chapter
xii
a
welcome
witness
assuredly
the
congregation
had
no
reason
to
complain
that
the
anticipated
sensation
was
not
forthcoming
there
was
an
agitated
rustle
through
the
chapel
every
one
looked
eagerly
at
johnson
wondering
what
reply
he
would
make
to
the
accusation
of
brand
for
a
moment
or
so
the
minister
stood
silent
with
upraised
face
his
lips
moved
in
silent
prayer
for
he
was
seeking
from
god
that
aid
which
was
denied
to
him
by
man
miss
arnott
white
and
trembling
violently
leaned
forward
in
expectation
of
the
denial
she
felt
certain
would
come
for
quite
a
minute
there
was
dead
silence
it
was
broken
by
the
accused
man
lord
thou
knowest
said
he
in
the
words
of
jeremiah
me
and
visit
me
and
revenge
me
on
my
persecutors
he
paused
and
looked
quietly
at
the
rugged
face
of
brand
brother
korah
continued
the
minister
you
have
borne
false
witness
against
me
i
am
innocent
of
this
crime
you
would
place
on
my
shoulders
what
evidence
can
you
bring
forward
to
prove
that
you
speak
truly
let
me
hear
your
grounds
of
accusation
that
i
may
reply
to
them
as
best
i
can
brand
was
considerably
surprised
at
the
calmness
of
this
speech
it
was
very
different
from
what
he
had
expected
he
glanced
with
some
embarrassment
at
farmer
carwell
shall
i
question
him
he
demanded
surely
brother
answered
carwell
gravely
the
meanest
criminal
has
a
right
to
a
hearing
question
our
pastor
that
we
may
learn
if
he
is
still
to
teach
us
or
if
he
should
be
cast
out
of
emmanuel
fold
i
ask
for
nothing
better
than
such
an
examination
cried
johnson
i
stand
here
as
i
would
at
the
judgment
seat
to
defend
my
name
and
life
begin
brother
korah
on
what
grounds
do
you
accuse
me
you
loved
bithiah
said
brand
harshly
is
that
a
crime
is
love
forbidden
by
the
gospel
yes
i
loved
her
miss
arnott
winced
at
the
tenderness
of
his
tone
i
would
have
made
her
my
honoured
wife
but
that
she
refused
me
why
did
she
leave
your
house
because
she
loved
finland
the
nephew
of
our
brother
carwell
i
judged
him
too
godless
for
bithiah
and
i
forbade
her
to
see
him
also
i
informed
her
that
i
would
place
her
in
the
care
of
you
brother
korah
to
be
taken
back
to
koiau
for
love
of
finland
she
left
my
house
whither
she
went
i
know
not
yet
you
were
near
the
scene
of
the
crime
on
the
night
on
which
bithiah
may
be
supposed
to
have
been
murdered
certainly
i
went
there
because
it
was
her
favourite
walk
but
i
never
saw
a
sign
of
her
on
this
holy
book
johnson
touched
the
great
bible
before
him
i
never
saw
the
girl
what
of
her
treasure
brother
the
pearls
she
took
those
with
her
as
she
had
every
right
to
did
you
not
take
them
from
her
dead
body
that
you
might
pay
your
debts
no
cried
johnson
furiously
how
dare
you
assume
that
i
am
guilty
of
such
an
act
i
never
saw
the
girl
dead
i
took
no
pearls
from
her
body
where
they
are
i
know
no
more
than
you
do
yet
your
debts
are
paid
they
are
paid
in
full
by
yourself
no
by
some
one
whose
name
i
decline
to
give
brand
looked
down
with
a
sardonic
smile
if
honest
enough
himself
the
man
methods
of
conducting
an
examination
were
certainly
open
to
criticism
such
a
statement
is
incredible
he
declared
as
a
rule
men
debts
are
not
paid
by
unknown
benefactors
nevertheless
mine
are
paid
said
johnson
firmly
besides
my
benefactor
is
not
unknown
you
are
ignorant
of
her
name
doubtless
but
i
am
not
her
name
repeated
korah
in
surprise
then
it
is
a
woman
do
you
dare
to
stand
there
and
state
that
you
permitted
your
debts
to
be
paid
by
a
woman
i
state
nothing
i
admit
nothing
my
debts
are
paid
and
by
the
proceeds
of
the
pearls
cried
brand
i
do
not
believe
your
fiction
about
a
woman
if
you
killed
bithiah
we
will
have
no
murderer
for
our
pastor
if
a
woman
as
you
say
paid
your
debts
you
are
not
fit
to
occupy
our
pulpit
it
would
appear
that
you
add
profligacy
to
stop
cried
miss
arnott
rising
and
coming
forward
with
the
sweep
and
style
of
a
lady
macbeth
i
forbid
you
brother
korah
to
blame
your
pastor
unjustly
his
debts
have
been
paid
by
a
woman
she
looked
round
to
emphasize
her
next
words
and
bespeak
the
attention
of
the
congregation
i
am
that
woman
she
said
drawing
herself
up
there
was
a
pause
during
which
miss
arnott
dramatic
instincts
were
strong
enough
to
appreciate
the
situation
there
she
stood
defiant
and
calm
with
the
eyes
of
the
amazed
congregation
fastened
on
her
johnson
remained
in
his
seat
waiting
developments
and
brand
taken
by
surprise
stared
at
her
dumbfounded
in
the
old
days
there
would
have
been
a
quick
curtain
on
this
situation
and
probably
much
applause
afterwards
and
miss
arnott
in
spite
of
her
conversion
and
religion
could
not
but
thrill
at
this
intrusion
of
melodrama
into
real
life
certainly
she
made
the
most
of
her
part
yes
she
repeated
touching
her
breast
i
am
the
woman
and
who
will
dare
to
accuse
me
of
acting
otherwise
than
in
a
christian
spirit
it
was
told
to
me
that
our
pastor
was
in
difficulties
about
money
and
as
i
am
rich
i
determined
to
discharge
his
debts
ye
one
another
burdens
saith
the
gospel
and
in
obedience
to
that
command
i
took
our
pastor
burden
on
my
shoulders
having
obtained
a
list
of
his
creditors
it
matters
not
how
i
went
to
london
and
there
paid
their
demands
in
full
that
i
might
do
good
in
secret
i
made
those
i
paid
promise
to
say
no
word
of
my
deed
our
pastor
sought
to
learn
my
name
but
could
not
until
i
myself
revealed
it
to
him
i
did
so
said
miss
arnott
in
her
grandest
voice
because
he
was
accused
of
stealing
those
pearls
to
discharge
his
liabilities
of
the
crime
you
would
fix
upon
him
brother
brand
he
is
innocent
i
paid
the
money
still
no
one
spoke
least
of
all
brand
for
he
realized
that
his
accusation
had
fallen
to
pieces
hopelessly
miss
arnott
looked
around
her
and
saw
her
opportunity
for
making
an
effective
exit
seizing
it
she
swept
with
measured
steps
towards
the
door
there
she
paused
and
stretched
out
her
arm
towards
brand
that
diggeth
a
pit
shall
fall
into
it
she
declaimed
and
still
facing
the
congregation
she
withdrew
slowly
in
a
transpontine
theatre
the
intensity
of
the
scene
would
have
brought
down
the
house
as
it
was
these
good
people
simply
sat
silent
and
stared
johnson
was
the
first
to
recover
himself
he
rose
solemnly
my
honour
has
been
vindicated
he
said
brother
korah
i
demand
that
you
withdraw
your
accusation
yes
yes
withdraw
the
accusation
cried
the
congregation
awaking
from
their
apathy
our
pastor
is
innocent
brand
made
as
if
to
speak
he
wished
to
question
johnson
concerning
the
missing
curtain
cord
but
at
this
moment
one
of
the
more
enthusiastic
members
struck
up
a
hymn
the
others
joined
in
lustily
and
drowned
the
words
of
the
missionary
seeing
that
the
sympathy
of
the
greatest
number
was
with
him
johnson
was
wise
enough
to
withdraw
as
the
singing
grew
louder
and
the
people
became
more
excited
he
descended
the
rostrum
and
left
the
chapel
outside
the
night
was
moonless
and
starless
and
hardly
had
the
minister
taken
half
a
dozen
steps
when
his
arm
was
seized
by
brand
the
man
was
shaking
with
nervous
excitement
brother
johnson
he
said
in
an
agitated
voice
believe
me
i
bear
you
no
i
accused
you
in
all
good
faith
but
the
lord
hath
spoken
i
now
know
you
did
not
steal
the
pearls
to
pay
your
debts
i
have
no
doubt
you
can
also
explain
how
the
cord
with
which
bithiah
was
strangled
came
to
be
missing
from
your
study
that
i
fear
at
this
present
moment
i
can
not
replied
the
minister
simply
but
you
must
believe
in
my
innocence
now
i
do
i
do
but
do
not
look
on
me
as
your
enemy
i
acted
for
the
glory
of
the
lord
i
would
have
cut
you
off
as
a
withered
branch
i
see
my
mistake
now
think
of
me
i
pray
only
as
your
friend
i
believe
you
accused
me
in
good
faith
brother
korah
let
us
say
no
more
about
the
matter
brand
did
not
speak
but
wrung
the
minister
hand
hard
and
darted
back
to
the
chapel
johnson
took
his
way
homeward
wondering
at
the
rigid
nature
of
the
man
who
would
have
ruined
him
in
all
honesty
if
thy
right
hand
offend
thee
cut
it
off
that
was
the
precept
upon
which
brand
had
acted
and
but
for
miss
arnott
evidence
he
would
have
turned
johnson
adrift
on
the
world
with
a
dishonoured
name
and
an
endangered
life
the
pastor
shuddered
at
the
missionary
rigour
but
he
silently
admitted
his
honesty
of
purpose
then
standing
under
the
stars
he
took
off
his
hat
and
thanked
god
for
having
aided
him
in
his
trouble
there
would
be
no
question
now
of
his
leaving
bethgamul
as
he
drew
near
his
house
he
saw
a
dark
form
at
the
gate
a
few
steps
brought
him
beside
it
and
he
then
recognized
miss
arnott
she
started
as
he
came
up
and
looked
at
him
in
the
glare
of
the
gaslight
her
eyes
were
full
of
tears
miss
arnott
said
johnson
clasping
her
passive
hand
i
thank
you
from
my
soul
for
the
noble
way
in
which
you
defended
me
it
was
only
right
whispered
the
woman
trembling
at
his
touch
i
know
you
are
innocent
recollecting
slade
discovery
and
recalling
his
own
suspicions
johnson
laid
his
hand
on
her
arm
do
you
know
who
murdered
her
i
no
how
should
i
know
then
she
caught
sight
of
the
expression
on
his
face
she
shrank
back
surely
you
do
suspect
me
she
said
in
tones
of
horror
miss
arnott
replied
the
minister
anxiously
i
will
be
plain
with
you
on
the
spot
where
bithiah
body
was
found
slade
the
policeman
discovered
your
did
he
know
it
was
mine
no
i
did
not
tell
him
but
his
theory
is
that
the
woman
to
whom
the
belongs
killed
the
girl
were
you
there
on
that
night
no
i
went
back
to
my
house
after
my
quarrel
with
bithiah
and
i
was
indoors
all
the
evening
how
came
that
to
be
there
then
bithiah
tore
the
from
my
ear
explained
miss
arnott
hurriedly
i
can
show
you
the
scar
no
doubt
she
took
it
with
her
to
the
field
and
dropped
it
when
she
was
assaulted
by
the
person
who
killed
her
i
had
no
hand
in
her
death
you
believe
me
do
you
yes
i
do
replied
johnson
promptly
i
can
not
think
a
woman
who
could
act
as
you
have
done
would
murder
a
defenceless
girl
after
our
quarrel
i
never
saw
her
i
hated
her
why
because
she
was
the
one
you
loved
i
was
jealous
and
unjust
but
i
would
not
have
killed
her
i
am
sure
of
that
said
johnson
kindly
but
tell
me
where
did
you
get
that
from
a
gipsy
girl
named
zara
lovell
she
had
a
pair
i
admired
very
much
they
were
of
gipsy
workmanship
and
i
paid
her
well
to
get
me
a
similar
pair
then
she
still
kept
her
own
yes
at
least
i
suppose
so
she
had
them
on
when
i
saw
her
last
about
a
year
ago
but
why
do
you
ask
slade
suspects
that
zara
killed
bithiah
out
of
jealousy
on
account
your
story
of
the
would
seem
to
confirm
his
belief
after
all
the
found
by
slade
may
not
be
yours
i
ca
say
replied
miss
arnott
drawing
her
shawl
round
her
she
might
have
killed
bithiah
as
you
say
and
lost
her
own
in
the
struggle
if
it
is
mine
bithiah
herself
must
have
taken
it
with
her
she
touched
the
minister
timidly
you
believe
in
my
innocence
yes
i
am
sure
of
it
thank
god
for
that
i
could
stand
any
one
doubting
me
but
you
and
before
johnson
could
stop
her
the
excited
woman
had
bent
down
and
kissed
his
hand
the
next
moment
she
was
gone
with
a
thoughtful
face
johnson
walked
inside
pondering
on
the
great
love
she
bore
him
his
feelings
were
touched
he
thought
more
about
her
than
he
had
done
since
the
death
of
bithiah
was
it
possible
that
the
void
in
his
heart
great
as
it
was
could
ever
be
filled
up
the
very
thought
of
such
a
thing
seemed
treason
against
the
dead
the
next
day
he
received
a
letter
from
slade
which
caused
him
considerable
surprise
it
contained
certain
instructions
which
for
his
own
safety
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
carry
out
amongst
other
things
slade
stated
that
by
threatening
to
denounce
the
jew
as
a
receiver
of
stolen
goods
he
had
induced
him
to
return
with
him
to
grimleigh
he
hoped
to
bring
him
to
the
minister
house
at
about
four
that
day
johnson
was
delighted
with
the
intelligence
it
promised
more
completely
to
vindicate
him
meanwhile
having
implicit
faith
in
slade
he
duly
carried
out
his
instructions
all
that
day
he
was
much
agitated
he
kept
within
doors
and
refused
to
see
any
one
for
he
was
determined
not
to
go
amongst
his
people
until
his
character
was
clear
he
admitted
chard
only
for
him
he
had
sent
in
accordance
with
slade
instructions
the
inspector
was
every
bit
as
curious
as
johnson
himself
and
it
was
with
great
impatience
they
awaited
the
arrival
of
the
jew
and
the
policeman
in
the
interim
he
told
chard
of
shackel
accusation
now
you
will
see
if
these
accusations
are
true
said
johnson
emphatically
if
i
sold
the
pearls
this
man
will
recognize
me
at
once
and
if
he
does
not
recognize
you
what
then
well
he
may
be
able
to
describe
the
man
who
did
sell
the
pearls
the
murderer
without
doubt
said
johnson
gravely
seeing
that
they
were
taken
from
the
body
well
i
hope
we
get
at
the
truth
anyway
said
chard
i
had
no
idea
slade
was
so
smart
at
four
to
the
minute
the
policeman
arrived
and
with
him
a
fat
dark
little
man
of
a
pronounced
hebraic
character
whom
he
introduced
as
abraham
moss
of
hatton
garden
explained
the
jew
with
a
lisp
i
bought
some
pearlth
from
a
gentleman
for
two
thouthand
poundth
is
this
the
gentleman

or

pearls
asked
chard
brown
luke
brown
i
knew
it
wath
a
faith
name
and
the
jew
stopped
for
the
door
had
opened
and
in
it
stood
a
man
the
very
man
for
whom
johnson
had
sent
in
accordance
with
slade
instructions
why
cried
moss
the
gent
ath
thold
me
the
pearlth
they
all
three
turned
simultaneously
towards
the
door
and
saw
finland
chapter
xiii
arrested
when
jack
finland
came
in
answer
to
johnson
invitation
he
little
knew
the
kind
of
reception
that
awaited
him
he
entered
the
study
with
an
alert
step
but
the
merry
expression
quickly
faded
from
his
face
when
he
recognized
moss
nor
was
the
presence
of
slade
even
though
in
plain
clothes
and
his
superior
officer
in
any
way
reassuring
the
gent
ath
thold
the
pearlth
lisped
moss
pointing
a
finger
at
the
oh
this
is
the
gentleman
is
it
said
inspector
chard
blandly
come
in
finland
you
are
just
in
time
for
what
asked
jack
making
a
fight
for
it
he
saw
that
he
was
in
a
trap
and
anxious
to
get
out
of
it
glanced
at
window
and
door
but
chard
blocked
the
one
slade
the
other
there
was
nothing
for
it
as
finland
quickly
saw
but
to
make
a
bold
stand
and
face
the
thing
out
if
possible
for
what
said
he
looking
calmly
at
the
unfriendly
faces
before
him
he
felt
it
was
well
to
know
exactly
how
things
stood
before
committing
himself
in
any
way
about
those
lost
pearls
for
one
thing
growled
slade
and
that
girl
murder
for
what
have
i
to
do
with
either
i
know
nothing
about
any
murder
said
moss
but
you
are
the
gent
ath
thold

gave
you
two
thouthand
poundth
for
them
come

tho

finland
clap
a
tackle
on
your
jaw
you
measly
hebrew
abuse
wo
do
finland
struck
in
chard
you
had
better
keep
a
curb
on
your
tongue
it
always
best
to
come
quietly
you
dare
arrest
me
that
is
my
intention
as
soon
as
i
can
get
a
warrant
in
the
mean
time
i
not
likely
to
lose
sight
of
you
my
fine
fellow
what
your
charge

whose
murder
the
murder
of
a
polynesian
girl
called
tera
or
bithiah
it
a
lie
cried
finland
violently
i
never
killed
the
poor
girl
i
loved
her
too
well
to
lay
a
finger
on
her
johnson
who
had
remained
silent
till
now
turned
to
the
sailor
unhappy
man
he
said
solemnly
do
not
add
falsehood
to
your
sins
of
murder
and
theft
tera
left
this
house
with
the
pearls
and
when
her
dead
body
was
found
the
pearls
were
gone
your
captain
shackel
came
to
blackmail
me
for
what
shackel
cried
jack
savagely
the
blamed
old
shellback
yes
captain
jacob
declared
that
i
had
sold
the
pearls
in
london
he
demanded
five
hundred
pounds
as
the
price
of
his
silence
i
declined
to
compound
a
felony
and
at
once
informed
slade
here
of
the
threat
slade
went
to
london
for
the
purpose
of
seeing
this
gentleman
to
whom
the
pearls
had
been
sold
and
yes
i
did
that
said
the
constable
excitedly
cutting
the
minister
short
and
i
called
on
moss
his
description
of
the
seller
applied
so
exactly
to
you
that
i
wrote
to
johnson
asking
him
to
get
you
to
come
here
that
we
might
confront
you
with
moss
me
ath

in
your
reception
i
had
my
suspicions
about

retorted
finland
but
you
a
long
way
out
let
me
tell
you
i
never

girl
then
how

moss
said
chard
since
i
received
the
intelligence
of
guilt
i
have
been
making
inquiries
and
i
find
he
is
part
owner
of
the
schooner
lying
out
in
the
bay
yonder
i
expect
he
spent
the
money
in
buying
her
oh

thwindler
cried
the
excited
hebrew
ith
thith
tho
half
the
is
mine
admitted
jack
sulkily
but
i
not
going
to
tell
you

i
will
have
my
money
screeched
the
irate
shylock
now
come
along
please
we
must
get
this
warrant
said
slade
taking
the
arm
of
moss
and
pulling
him
out
of
the
room
left
alone
with
johnson
and
chard
the
sailor
made
no
attempt
to
leave
he
sat
down
with
a
sulky
expression
on
his
face
and
betrayed
not
the
least
concern
it
would
seem
that
he
was
not
fully
alive
to
the
danger
of
his
position
chard
looked
at
him
with
bland
satisfaction
you
had
better
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
my
man
said
he
jack
scowled
at
him
and
rudely
turned
his
chair
so
as
to
face
the
minister
johnson
he
said
quietly
you
are
an
honest
man
amongst
these
land
sharks
and
i
can
trust
you
i
seem
to
be
in
a
tight
place
but
i
swear
that
i
am
as
innocent
as
an
unborn
babe
shackel
can
prove
my
innocence
so
i
ask
you
to
take
a
note
to
him
from
me
johnson
who
had
no
love
for
shackel
after
the
way
in
which
the
little
scoundrel
had
tried
to
blackmail
him
would
have
refused
but
chard
at
finland
back
made
a
sign
to
him
to
accept
the
trust
the
inspector
thought
that
jack
was
about
to
write
to
shackel
asking
him
to
destroy
some
evidence
which
might
implicate
him
still
further
in
the
crime
at
all
events
he
thought
the
letter
would
probably
prove
of
some
value
directly
or
indirectly
he
was
glad
therefore
when
johnson
understanding
his
signal
acceded
to
finland
request
certainly
i
will
deliver
your
note
said
the
minister
gravely
i
only
hope
you
will
be
able
to
free
yourself
from
this
critical
position
do
you
believe
i
killed
tera
if
you
sold
the
pearls
it
certainly
looks
very
like
it
replied
johnson
seeing
that
they
were
taken
from
her
dead
body
yet
as
i
know
you
loved
the
girl
and
she
was
willing
to
give
you
both
herself
and
her
pearls
i
confess
that
i
have
my
doubts
as
to
your
guilt
besides
i
honestly
admit
that
i
do
not
think
you
are
a
bad
man
frivolous
and
godless
and
profligate
no
doubt
you
are
but
far
from
being
a
murderer
no
finland
black
as
are
appearances
against
you
i
can
not
bring
myself
to
believe
in
your
guilt
jack
looked
at
the
minister
with
a
friendly
smile
and
stretched
out
a
large
brown
hand
you
a
white
man
said
he
coolly
i
take
more
stock
in
your
piety
when
i
out
of
this
fix
shake
the
minister
hesitated
for
although
he
really
did
believe
in
the
young
sailor
innocence
yet
the
man
had
been
his
rival
and
he
found
it
difficult
to
be
on
easy
terms
with
him
however
his
better
nature
prevailed
and
he
shook
hands
that
heartens
me
up
a
lot
said
jack
cheerfully
there
is
balm
in
gilead
after
all
as
rachel
says
now
i
score
a
line
to
that
blamed
old
idiot
who
has
caused
all
this
breeze
who
is
that
asked
chard
finland
looked
at
him
again
ignored
him
completely
and
in
silence
sat
down
in
the
chair
before
the
desk
vacated
by
the
minister
chard
kept
his
eyes
on
him
and
smiled
at
the
foolish
manner
in
which
the
man
was
giving
himself
away
honestly
speaking
he
had
no
towards
jack
but
the
insolent
behaviour
of
the
sailor
was
not
without
its
effect
and
he
determined
when
the
warrant
came
to
spare
him
in
no
way
that
finland
might
be
innocent
the
inspector
did
not
consider
at
all
he
had
sold
the
pearls
as
was
proved
plainly
by
the
evidence
of
moss
and
he
could
only
have
taken
them
from
the
dead
body
the
coolness
amazed
him
for
jack
scribbled
away
at
his
note
quite
nonchalantly
utterly
indifferent
to
the
sword
of
damocles
which
swung
over
his
head
chard
marvelled
what
defence
he
could
have
in
his
mind
to
make
johnson
looked
out
of
the
window
he
also
was
puzzled
by
the
behaviour
of
finland
on
the
face
of
the
evidence
against
him
it
was
impossible
to
doubt
his
complicity
yet
the
minister
could
in
no
way
divine
the
man
motive
for
murder
he
could
have
had
the
pearls
for
the
asking
there
was
no
need
for
him
to
kill
the
poor
girl
moreover
finland
had
loved
her
dearly
and
it
was
incredible
that
for
any
cause
he
could
have
killed
her
yet
he
had
sold
the
pearls
there
could
be
no
doubt
about
that
and
he
was
the
nephew
of
the
man
in
whose
field
the
body
had
been
so
skilfully
hidden
how
to
reconcile
these
conflicting
elements
johnson
could
not
see
he
was
still
puzzling
the
matter
out
in
his
own
mind
when
jack
finished
his
letter
with
a
cheery
laugh
you
laugh
on
the
other
side
of
your
mouth
soon
said
chard
testily
i
guess
that
my
biz
retorted
finland
addressing
the
inspector
for
the
first
time
my
habit
to
squeal
afore
i
hurt
johnson
here
is
the
letter
i
take
it
kind
of
you
if
deliver
it
to
old
ramshackel
as
soon
as
you
can
i
see
to
it
finland
replied
johnson
slipping
the
note
into
his
pocket
whither
it
was
followed
by
chard
with
greedy
eyes
and
i
trust
for
your
own
sake
and
your
uncle
that
you
will
prove
yourself
innocent
of
this
fearful
charge
well
i
do
say
as
i
have
got
an
ace
somewhere
sir
but
it
ai
time
to
plank
it
down
yet
may
i
smoke
i
would
if
i
were
you
interposed
chard
you
not
get
tobacco
in
prison
you
know
nor
manners
either
i
guess
if
you
to
turn
the
key
chard
vouchsafed
no
reply
and
the
three
waited
in
silence
for
the
return
of
slade
in
a
surprisingly
short
space
of
time
considering
his
errand
the
constable
returned
in
uniform
with
a
warrant
for
finland
arrest
now
that
the
worst
had
come
jack
turned
a
trifle
pale
and
slipped
his
pipe
into
his
pocket
with
an
uneasy
laugh
chard
seemed
well
pleased
take
him
to
the
slade
he
ordered
we
have
him
up
before
the
magistrate
at
poldew
i
remain
here
johnson
and
i
must
have
a
few
words
come
on
said
slade
now
a
typical
he
laid
his
hand
on
finland
collar
do
show
off
mate
said
finland
twisting
himself
free
i
go
quiet
enough
let
walk
and
then
they
take
us
for
brothers
no
use
kicking
up
dust
you
know
chard
i
put
a
spoke
in
your
wheel
before
this
crook
is
straightened
out
johnson
you
a
square
man
i
thank
you
for
your
kindness
do
forget
to
give
that
letter
to
the
skipper
i
promise
you
it
shall
be
delivered
this
evening
jack
and
slade
departed
quite
affectionately
as
the
sailor
had
suggested
chard
waited
till
they
were
fairly
on
their
way
then
he
turned
to
the
minister
peremptorily
now
then
sir
that
letter
if
you
please
johnson
looked
astonished
and
ill
pleased
the
letter
is
for
captain
shackel
sir
afterwards
perhaps
first
it
is
for
me
you
do
think
i
am
going
to
lose
a
chance
of
making
things
safe
for
this
scoundrel
hanging
finland
is
not
a
scoundrel
rejoined
johnson
quietly
indeed
i
begin
to
think
he
is
perfectly
innocent
as
to
the
letter
that
remains
in
my
pocket
johnson
i
do
want
to
be
unpleasant
cried
chard
looking
ugly
but
i
must
remind
you
that
i
am
a
police
officer
i
a
perfect
right
to
see
the
letter
of
a
man
under
arrest
on
a
criminal
charge
and
i
must
insist
upon
your
handing
it
over
to
me
does
the
law
authorize
you
to
read
this
letter
yes
sir
it
does
if
the
man
were
free
it
would
not
but
the
law
permits
me
to
gather
all
evidence
i
can
in
support
of
the
case
that
letter
may
be
invaluable
give
it
to
me
please
johnson
hesitated
he
saw
the
weakness
of
his
position
he
wished
to
assist
finland
for
he
believed
him
to
be
innocent
moreover
he
did
not
wish
without
the
strongest
reason
to
fail
in
the
trust
he
had
undertaken
still
chard
as
the
representative
of
the
law
had
right
and
might
on
his
side
if
he
did
not
give
up
the
letter
willingly
he
would
no
doubt
be
forced
to
on
consideration
he
decided
he
could
do
nothing
but
yield
here
is
the
letter
said
he
taking
it
from
his
pocket
i
trust
you
will
deliver
it
to
its
address
when
you
have
done
with
it
that
depends
entirely
upon
the
contents
said
chard
grimly
he
untwisted
the
piece
of
paper
finland
had
not
put
it
into
an
envelope
the
reason
for
this
was
soon
apparent
chard
looked
at
it
carefully
then
he
swore
chard
reproved
johnson
why
such
language
the
inspector
clapped
the
letter
on
the
table
before
johnson
that
enough
to
make
a
man
swear
the
rascal
has
written
his
letter
in
cypher
it
ran
as
follows
illustration
coded
message
ca
you
understand
it
asked
johnson
puzzled
no
can
you
snapped
the
inspector
picking
up
the
cypher
not
a
bit
what
will
you
do
now
take
it
to
the
man
who
does
who
is
that
why
said
chard
coolly
the
man
to
whom
it
is
written
captain
shackel
i
make
him
read
it
to
me
then
chard
went
off
left
alone
johnson
sighed
if
finland
is
innocent
he
thought
i
fear
we
shall
never
know
who
killed
poor
tera
chapter
xiv
an
amazing
incident
grimleigh
hummed
like
a
hive
in
the
swarming
season
through
slade
via
his
tattling
wife
the
news
of
finland
arrest
was
spread
with
the
rapidity
of
influenza
as
usual
rumour
increased
as
a
snowball
does
and
that
evening
half
the
town
knew
how
finland
had
met
tera
by
accident
near
carwell
field
how
he
had
quarrelled
with
her
strangled
her
and
fled
with
the
pearls
to
sell
them
in
london
and
buy
a
schooner
the
circumstantial
account
was
given
with
a
wealth
of
detail
which
did
credit
to
the
imagination
of
those
who
repeated
it
but
there
were
some
who
declined
to
believe
that
so
popular
and
genial
a
man
as
jack
could
be
guilty
of
a
crime
the
man
whole
life
gave
the
lie
to
it
amongst
those
who
refused
credence
to
the
accusation
was
carwell
the
old
farmer
was
greatly
agitated
by
the
news
of
the
arrest
and
forthwith
sought
out
chard
at
grimleigh
shortly
before
the
inspector
departed
for
poldew
for
the
last
hour
chard
with
the
in
his
pocket
had
been
seeking
captain
jacob
without
success
the
skipper
was
not
on
the
schooner
or
in
the
town
and
chard
feared
he
would
be
forced
to
postpone
the
delivery
of
the
letter
until
next
morning
this
would
be
inconvenient
as
he
was
bound
to
be
at
poldew
when
finland
was
brought
up
as
he
would
be
next
day
before
the
magistrate
but
the
inspector
was
determined
that
no
one
should
deliver
the
letter
but
himself
for
he
intended
to
force
shackel
to
translate
it
finally
chard
resolved
to
take
jack
with
him
to
poldew
on
that
night
and
leave
slade
behind
with
instructions
to
find
and
bring
on
captain
shackel
the
next
morning
he
had
just
arranged
this
with
slade
when
carwell
made
his
appearance
perturbed
and
angry
what
all
this
demanded
the
old
man
anxiously
i
hear
that
my
nephew
has
been
arrested
quite
right
carwell
on
a
charge
of
murdering
the
native
girl
who
was
a
ward
of
johnson
tera
bithiah
you
know
her
name
better
than
i
do
but
it
is
impossible
that
jack
killed
her
inspector
he
loved
the
girl
he
was
prepared
to
marry
her
the
charge
is
ridiculous
no
doubt
replied
chard
coolly
i
ca
myself
see
his
reason
for
the
crime
but
we
have
proof
positive
that
he
sold
tera
pearls
in
london
and
bought
a
share
in
the
with
the
proceeds
jack
never
told
me
that
i
understood
from
him
that
she
was
the
property
of
captain
shackel
shackel
says
differently
carwell
he
told
me
himself
that
your
nephew
bought
a
share
and
what
is
more
paid
for
it
on
the
nail
impossible
he
had
not
the
money
oh
yes
he
had
moss
declared
that
finland
got
two
thousand
pounds
for
the
pearls
to
obtain
them
he
killed
tera
i
do
i
wo
believe
it
cried
carwell
growing
very
red
jack
is
an
honest
lad
and
my
own
sister
son
if
he
were
guilty
he
would
not
return
here
into
the
jaws
of
danger
if
he
were
in
funds
he
would
not
want
money
from
me
or
risk
his
liberty
and
neck
to
come
here
for
it
oh
so
he
wants
money
from
you
he
does
i
see
no
reason
to
deny
the
truth
my
nephew
came
here
to
ask
me
for
five
hundred
pounds
he
wants
that
amount
to
pay
wages
and
provision
the
boat
for
her
cruise
to
the
south
seas
if
he
killed
the
girl
and
sold
the
pearls
for
the
amount
you
say
he
would
not
require
more
but
he
paid
away
the
proceeds
of
the
pearls
for
his
share
in
the
he
could
have
purchased
a
share
for
less
than
two
thousand
the
whole
boat
could
be
bought
for
three
she
is
of
no
great
tonnage
chard
looked
puzzled
certainly
there
was
reason
in
what
carwell
said
and
finland
behaviour
was
most
inconsistent
i
ca
understand
your
nephew
carwell
said
the
inspector
if
he
is
innocent
why
does
he
not
prove
his
innocence
he
will
if
you
give
him
a
chance
i
have
given
him
every
chance
said
chard
nettled
by
this
imputation
cast
on
his
fair
dealing
he
refuses
to
give
any
explanation
moreover
if
he
can
exonerate
himself
he
will
have
an
opportunity
of
doing
so
morning
at
poldew
when
he
is
brought
before
the
magistrate
can
i
see
him
now
certainly
slade
will
take
you
to
him
try
and
persuade
him
to
tell
the
truth
if
he
goes
on
as
he
is
doing
now
he
will
be
committed
for
trial
and
bail
will
be
refused
the
crime
with
which
he
is
charged
is
serious
remember
jack
has
committed
no
crime
said
carwell
hotly
let
me
see
him
hardly
had
the
old
man
left
the
office
with
slade
when
the
door
was
pushed
open
and
captain
jacob
danced
in
the
little
man
was
in
a
furious
rage
and
his
language
was
worthy
of
the
occasion
he
swore
at
chard
for
quite
two
minutes
without
repeating
himself
and
it
was
only
when
he
paused
for
want
of
breath
that
the
inspector
managed
to
get
in
a
word
come
come
he
said
bristling
with
official
dignity
we
ca
have
this
sort
of
thing
here
you
must
not
behave
in
this
way
oh
i
must
must
i
screeched
shackel
shaking
his
fist
why
you
son
of
a
gun
ai
you
run
in
my
mate
how
d
think
i
going
to
light
out
for
the
islands
without
finland
you
light
out
as
you
call
it
all
alone
if
finland
ca
prove
his
innocence
of
this
murder
murder
great
c√¶sar
he
did
kill
the
gal
oh
yes
he
did
and
you
know
it
see
here
chard
caught
the
excited
man
by
the
arm
you
tried
to
blackmail
johnson
by
stating
that
he
sold
these
pearls
now
you
knew
quite
well
that
finland
sold
what
do
you
mean
by
this
game
you
mind
your
own
business
and
i
run
my
own
circus
snarled
jacob
your
blackmailing
is
my
business
said
chard
and
you
do
go
out
of
here
until
you
explain
yourself
sha
explain
anything
yes
you
will
this
letter
of
finland
for
instance
chard
spread
out
the
cypher
on
the
table
and
jacob
pounced
on
it
like
a
hawk
he
ran
a
dirty
finger
along
the
mystic
line
then
turned
to
the
inspector
with
an
injured
air
what
all
this
bally
rot
he
asked
i
do
know
looks
like
chinese
i
guess
but
finland
wrote
it
for
you
to
read
said
chard
stupefied
by
this
unexpected
ignorance
then
why
the
tarnation
could
he
write
in
english
snapped
the
captain
i
ca
read
hen
scratches
the
inspector
looked
glum
he
could
not
say
whether
jacob
spoke
truly
or
falsely
it
was
possible
that
finland
might
be
playing
a
trick
and
jesting
with
the
dignity
of
the
law
on
the
other
hand
it
seemed
incredible
that
one
in
so
serious
a
position
should
act
in
such
a
way
chard
looked
hard
at
the
sallow
face
of
the
skipper
apparently
he
was
speaking
the
truth
his
face
was
set
like
a
mask
then
a
new
idea
struck
mr
inspector
if
you
ca
read
it
some
one
on
board
your
ship
can
he
declared
well
i
should
smile
d
think
we
carry
a
university
on
board
but
if
finland
had
not
meant
this
letter
to
be
read
he
would
not
have
written
it
you
know
this
cypher
do
lie
i
knock
your
head
off
if
you
give
me
the
lie
retorted
shackel
let
me
see
finland
and
i
ask
him
myself
what
the
dickens
he
means
by
playing
low
down
on
the
old
man
no
you
wo
see
him
said
the
inspector
sharply
for
all
i
know
the
sight
of
this
cypher
may
be
a
signal
to
bring
you
together
you
may
wish
to
gain
instructions
from
finland
regarding
the
removal
of
evidence
me
take
instructions
bawled
the
skipper
why
cuss
you
ai
i
a
astride
it
be
a
dandy
fine
thing
for
captain
jacob
to
obey
orders
of
any
squawking
son
of
a
here
gim
me
that
letter
and
i
git
chard
snatched
the
cypher
off
the
table
and
put
it
into
his
pocket
no
said
he
if
you
ca
read
it
it
is
meant
for
you
stealing
my
property
now
lord
i
like
to
give
you
a
dozen
at
the
gangway
and
i
like
to
put
you
in
gaol
you
blackmailing
scoundrel
cried
chard
hotly
then
he
became
aware
it
was
beneath
him
to
bandy
words
with
this
abusive
sailor
and
resumed
his
former
dignified
tone
come
come
this
will
not
do
he
cried
you
must
come
to
poldew
morning
and
give
evidence
about
your
mate
and
those
pearls
i
ca
and
what
more
i
sha
oh
yes
i
think
you
can
since
you
tried
to
blackmail
johnson
you
know
quite
well
that
finland
sold
the
pearls
i
dare
say
you
know
how
he
got
them
for
all
i
know
you
may
even
be
an
accessory
after
the
fact
in
this
murder
i
have
you
watched
mind
so
you
better
turn
up
at
poldew
oh
i
turn
up
never
you
fear
growled
jacob
in
a
surly
manner
my
all
right
i
guess
i
do
want
no
to
square
me
and
let
me
tell
you
cried
jacob
furiously
if
you
send
any
more
blamed
sheeny
cusses
to
board
my
ship
i
chuck
over
as
i
did
the
last
oh
said
chard
laughing
so
moss
has
been
on
board
your
boat
has
he
for
two
minutes
he
was
then
i
slung
him
overside
to
wash
wanted
to
put
an
execution
on
my
barky
the
jerusalem
hound
he
have
the
law
of
you
for
that
said
the
inspector
turning
to
his
papers
clear
out
now
my
man
and
report
yourself
at
poldew
or
it
will
be
the
worse
for
you
captain
shackel
backed
towards
the
door
with
an
evil
grin
i
be
there
you
bet
he
snapped
and
you
have
a
holy
time
with
me
i
can
tell
you
i
seen
a
better
man
than
you
made
out
of
mud
i
have
by
this
time
chard
patience
was
quite
exhausted
he
caught
jacob
in
his
arms
and
dropped
him
outside
the
door
then
instructing
a
constable
to
keep
an
eye
on
him
he
his
office
this
was
the
second
time
the
little
sea
captain
dignity
had
suffered
reversal
he
anathematized
chard
with
horrible
fluency
but
the
inspector
was
well
used
to
such
flowers
of
speech
and
they
affected
him
but
little
carwell
returned
to
tell
of
failure
his
nephew
had
been
all
that
was
civil
and
grateful
to
him
but
he
refused
altogether
to
make
him
his
confidant
the
farmer
had
begged
and
commanded
and
threatened
but
without
success
jack
gave
him
clearly
to
understand
that
he
had
his
own
way
of
conducting
his
own
affairs
and
that
way
he
intended
to
pursue
he
was
not
to
be
drawn
at
all
so
it
was
that
and
disappointed
carwell
was
obliged
to
leave
the
lad
after
reporting
his
failure
to
chard
he
went
home
in
a
state
of
depression
half
an
hour
later
the
inspector
left
grimleigh
with
his
prisoner
and
drove
over
to
poldew
in
truth
it
had
been
an
exciting
day
for
poldew
too
johnson
set
out
early
next
morning
on
foot
he
was
particularly
anxious
to
be
present
when
finland
was
brought
before
the
magistrate
he
still
believed
in
jack
innocence
but
for
the
life
of
him
he
could
not
understand
his
reticence
he
stepped
out
briskly
into
the
cool
fresh
air
his
mind
full
of
the
case
he
had
not
gone
far
before
he
met
pharaoh
lee
he
thought
of
slade
theory
and
determined
to
say
a
word
or
two
to
the
gipsy
good
morning
lee
i
glad
to
meet
you
he
said
gravely
i
particularly
wish
to
speak
to
you
about
zara
have
you
news
of
her
rye
no
but
i
have
been
talking
to
slade
the
policeman
about
her
ah
he
knows
something
for
sure
is
she
with
him
is
he
her
husband
was
it
he
took
her
away
from
me
speak
rye
speak
johnson
shook
his
head
slade
is
married
to
another
woman
he
said
slowly
but
he
thinks
that
zara
was
in
love
with
a
man
named
jack
finland
what
rye
with
the
gentile
who
killed
your
lady
i
have
heard
talk
of
him
we
are
not
yet
able
to
say
if
finland
killed
my
ward
lee
we
have
no
right
because
he
stands
accused
of
such
a
crime
to
judge
him
guilty
of
it
until
he
has
had
a
fair
chance
of
proving
his
innocence
he
is
to
be
examined
at
poldew
in
fact
i
am
now
on
my
way
there
to
be
present
at
his
examination
whether
slade
has
changed
his
mind
in
the
mean
while
i
can
not
say
but
a
day
or
two
back
he
suspected
zara
of
this
murder
i
wring
his
neck
for
him
if
he
dares
to
say
that
cried
pharaoh
in
his
wrath
job
how
does
he
make
it
out
oh
he
has
evidence
to
go
upon
you
may
depend
then
the
minister
related
to
him
slade
discovery
of
the
and
the
deductions
he
had
drawn
from
it
he
mentioned
too
that
finland
had
sold
the
pearls
now
it
would
seem
continued
johnson
that
zara
on
the
evidence
of
the
killed
bithiah
out
of
jealousy
robbed
her
dead
body
of
the
pearls
and
gave
them
to
finland
to
dispose
of
in
london
for
all
we
know
he
may
have
returned
here
to
take
zara
off
to
the
south
seas
in
the
schooner
which
he
bought
with
the
money
do
you
believe
this
rye
no
frankly
i
do
i
believe
that
the
belonged
to
miss
arnott
and
that
she
lost
it
during
her
quarrel
with
bithiah
it
was
probably
dropped
in
the
field
by
the
poor
girl
herself
when
she
struggled
with
her
assailant
as
to
finland
notwithstanding
his
disposal
of
the
pearls
i
can
not
make
up
my
mind
to
believe
him
guilty
of
murder
who
knows
rye
a
man
will
do
much
for
a
woman
sake
if
this
sailor
loved
zara
he
did
not
he
loved
bithiah
pharaoh
deliberated
for
a
moment
i
will
go
with
you
to
poldew
rye
he
said
it
is
necessary
that
i
should
hear
the
truth
so
be
it
lee
let
us
hope
that
is
what
we
shall
hear
they
continued
their
way
in
silence
neither
was
inclined
to
speak
it
was
late
when
they
arrived
and
the
court
house
was
already
crowded
johnson
garb
and
the
knowledge
of
his
connection
with
the
dead
girl
obtained
him
entrance
and
lee
pushing
close
after
him
they
managed
to
secure
a
very
good
position
both
for
seeing
and
hearing
jack
was
already
under
examination
before
the
magistrate
an
elderly
gentleman
with
a
professionally
bland
manner
the
prisoner
appeared
cool
and
composed
he
was
apparently
not
the
least
perturbed
at
the
position
in
which
he
found
himself
many
of
the
grimleigh
folk
were
present
amongst
them
carwell
and
korah
brand
everybody
was
ready
for
an
exciting
morning
as
it
came
about
they
had
cause
for
no
small
measure
of
excitement
though
hardly
in
the
direction
they
had
anticipated
i
am
not
guilty
of
this
murder
said
finland
in
a
clear
voice
and
i
will
prove
my
innocence
as
he
spoke
there
was
a
commotion
at
the
lower
end
of
the
court
a
man
and
a
woman
pushed
through
the
crowd
and
placed
themselves
in
full
view
of
the
assembly
the
man
was
captain
jacob
the
woman
a
girl
in
a
faded
yellow
dress
with
a
tartan
shawl
lee
uttered
a
cry
zara
he
said
as
he
caught
sight
of
the
dress
it
is
zara
but
he
was
wrong
it
was
not
zara
it
was
tera
chapter
xv
a
strange
story
who
is
this
asked
the
magistrate
amazed
at
the
commotion
the
grimleigh
people
recognizing
tera
were
talking
loudly
and
excitedly
amongst
themselves
a
babel
of
voices
rose
in
answer
to
the
question
but
the
usher
of
the
court
having
proclaimed
silence
captain
jacob
took
upon
himself
to
step
forward
this
sir
said
he
with
his
nasal
drawl
is
the
young
gal
tera
or
bithiah
who
was
supposed
to
have
been
scragged
what
does
the
man
mean
demanded
the
bench
how
dare
you
interrupt
the
court
man
mean
interposed
the
accused
well
i
guess
he
means
that
i
here
to
answer
to
the
charge
of
murdering
a
girl
who
not
dead
this
is
tera
the
young
lady
herself
your
worship
dear
me
dear
me
said
the
magistrate
fretfully
he
was
a
little
man
most
careful
of
the
dignity
of
his
position
all
this
is
very
irregular
not
to
say
unseemly
mr
inspector
perhaps
you
can
enlighten
us
chard
rose
and
cast
no
very
friendly
glance
towards
jacob
whom
he
strongly
suspected
of
having
contrived
this
dramatic
the
girl
is
tera
i
believe
usually
called
bithiah
your
worship
what
was
thought
to
be
her
body
was
found
in
a
cornfield
at
grimleigh
as
set
forth
in
the
charge
it
now
seems
that
there
has
been
some
mistake
as
to
identity
this
is
the
girl
herself
your
worship
and
i
am
innocent
finished
jack
silence
in
the
court
roared
the
usher
as
the
crowd
manifested
signs
of
giving
vent
to
their
feelings
i
am
to
understand
then
that
this
young
woman
is
the
supposed
victim
of
this
murder
said
benker
in
his
most
pompous
tones
it
is
really
most
extraordinary
i
do
know
that
i
have
ever
heard
of
anything
more
so
there
is
some
one
here
i
presume
prepared
and
competent
to
swear
to
her
identity
her
guardian
is
in
court
your
worship
who
is
her
guardian
the
reverend
johnson
your
worship
let
johnson
be
called
and
sworn
in
response
to
the
clerk
call
the
minister
stepped
up
to
the
box
he
looked
white
and
haggard
and
seemed
to
be
suffering
acutely
hitherto
he
had
schooled
himself
to
endure
the
loss
of
tera
now
she
was
here
in
the
flesh
and
likely
to
become
the
wife
of
the
man
who
stood
there
accused
of
having
murdered
her
the
revulsion
of
feeling
was
terrible
and
despite
himself
he
felt
a
very
demon
of
jealousy
awake
within
his
breast
with
an
effort
he
controlled
his
emotion
and
deposed
that
tera
was
his
ward
and
that
it
was
she
who
stood
before
them
now
the
magistrate
decided
that
his
evidence
was
sufficient
to
warrant
the
accused
discharge
on
the
score
of
murder
but
he
added
glancing
at
the
and
then
frowning
down
on
the
applause
which
once
again
showed
signs
of
ebullience
there
is
the
charge
of
robbery
from
the
body
i
think
we
must
have
some
evidence
upon
that
i
should
like
to
know
too
he
added
looking
at
tera
as
you
were
not
the
woman
who
was
killed
who
she
is
and
how
such
a
very
serious
mistake
has
come
about
perhaps
you
can
help
us
my
girl
these
remarks
were
addressed
in
part
to
tera
and
in
part
to
benker
confidential
clerk
from
whom
he
was
invariably
accustomed
to
take
his
cue
a
short
discussion
between
them
ended
in
the
magistrate
giving
instructions
for
tera
to
be
sworn
up
to
this
time
tera
had
not
spoken
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
jack
she
had
remained
standing
by
captain
shackel
she
now
lifted
her
eyes
to
the
magistrate
and
proceeded
to
reply
to
the
question
he
had
addressed
to
her
great
chief
she
said
sadly
there
was
a
slight
elevation
of
the
magistrate
eyebrows
as
she
said
the
words
the
one
who
is
dead
is
zara
zara
repeated
benker
puzzled
again
he
turned
to
his
clerk
pharaoh
who
had
been
standing
quietly
by
the
minister
gave
a
gasp
and
sprang
forward
you
killed
her
that
you
are
he
hissed
savagely
silence
sir
i
did
not
kill
her
continued
tera
with
dignity
perfectly
heedless
of
the
irregularity
of
such
intrusion
alas
why
should
i
slay
one
so
kind
to
me
you
wear
her
clothes
i
saw
that
as
you
came
in
went
on
lee
yes
i
wear
her
clothes
but
these
she
gave
to
me
for
one
of
my
pearls
silence
in
the
court
from
the
usher
if
the
decorum
of
this
court
is
not
more
properly
observed
i
shall
clear
it
said
the
magistrate
with
all
the
impressiveness
he
could
muster
understand
please
my
girl
that
i
can
not
have
interruptions
of
this
kind
you
will
proceed
with
what
you
have
to
say
unaided
if
you
please
tera
was
looking
calmly
round
at
the
crowd
before
her
her
eyes
fell
on
the
white
face
of
her
guardian
and
then
on
pharaoh
he
too
seemed
to
be
labouring
under
great
stress
of
emotion
a
reporter
at
the
solicitors
table
was
intent
upon
his
notes
delighted
no
doubt
at
the
turn
events
had
taken
no
mere
chronicle
of
legal
jargon
this
but
a
dramatic
tale
set
forth
by
the
principal
witness
herself
a
pretty
girl
the
very
stuff
he
knew
his
editor
would
revel
in
with
a
glance
first
at
jack
and
then
at
her
guardian
again
tera
began
i
am
the
daughter
of
buli
the
high
chief
of
koiau
johnson
brought
me
to
this
country
by
my
father
wish
that
i
might
with
its
good
people
become
civilized
and
take
back
with
me
to
my
land
the
fruits
of
civilization
i
had
pearls
which
buli
gave
to
me
that
i
might
buy
goods
for
my
people
when
i
returned
i
lived
with
johnson
after
i
had
finished
my
education
i
wished
to
marry
jack
but
my
guardian
would
not
let
me
he
said
that
jack
was
not
a
good
man
he
told
me
that
buli
had
sent
misi
brand
to
take
me
home
and
that
i
must
go
with
him
i
was
afraid
i
should
be
parted
from
jack
and
never
see
him
again
that
was
the
reason
i
ran
away
on
the
night
i
left
i
took
my
pearls
from
the
drawer
in
johnson
desk
he
had
left
his
keys
behind
him
and
i
had
no
difficulty
in
getting
them
the
pearls
were
mine
so
i
did
not
think
there
was
any
harm
in
taking
them
i
left
the
house
with
the
intention
of
walking
to
poldew
and
taking
the
train
to
london
i
was
going
to
see
captain
shackel
in
whose
ship
i
had
come
to
england
did
you
know
his
address
asked
the
magistrate
who
was
now
following
the
recital
with
much
interest
oh
yes
sir
i
knew
his
address
he
had
written
me
a
letter
shortly
before
i
left
stating
that
he
had
come
back
from
the
south
seas
and
was
in
london
i
determined
to
go
to
him
and
afterwards
send
for
jack
then
we
could
go
away
together
to
koiau
i
was
sorry
to
leave
johnson
who
had
been
good
to
me
but
i
was
afraid
he
would
make
me
go
with
misi
brand
and
part
me
from
jack
why
did
you
not
tell
any
one
where
you
were
going
asked
benker
or
at
least
leave
a
note
behind
you
explaining
your
absence
i
was
afraid
said
tera
simply
i
did
not
wish
to
be
followed
and
given
to
misi
brand
i
left
the
house
when
johnson
was
away
and
walked
up
to
farmer
carwell
field
on
my
way
to
poldew
there
i
met
with
a
girl
very
like
myself
she
was
a
gipsy
zara
said
lee
with
a
sigh
but
not
loud
enough
to
call
for
rebuke
she
told
me
her
name
was
zara
and
wanted
to
tell
my
fortune
resumed
tera
then
i
thought
if
i
could
change
clothes
with
her
i
might
escape
the
more
easily
from
my
guardian
and
misi
brand
at
first
zara
refused
to
change
clothes
but
i
promised
to
give
her
one
of
my
pearls
if
she
would
then
she
consented
we
went
behind
a
hedge
and
changed
clothes
i
gave
her
the
pearl
and
we
parted
i
never
saw
her
again
in
which
direction
did
she
go
asked
the
magistrate
to
whom
chard
had
sent
up
a
note
towards
grimleigh
by
the
road
i
had
come
did
she
say
why
she
was
going
to
grimleigh
yes
she
said
she
was
seeking
her
husband
and
his
name
his
name
shouted
pharaoh
unable
longer
to
keep
silence
if
you
interrupt
i
shall
commit
you
for
contempt
of
court
said
the
magistrate
angrily
how
dare
you
raise
your
voice
here
i
do
not
know
his
name
continued
the
witness
when
pharaoh
had
been
suppressed
zara
never
told
me
we
were
only
together
for
twenty
minutes
did
you
see
any
one
about
no
no
one
do
you
know
who
murdered
this
gipsy
girl
no
sir
said
tera
very
earnestly
how
was
i
to
know
that
she
went
to
meet
her
death
where
did
you
go
then
to
poldew
no
as
i
had
changed
my
clothes
i
thought
it
best
to
avoid
poldew
i
walked
to
the
station
beyond
and
caught
the
train
there
on
arriving
in
london
i
went
to
captain
jacob
and
told
him
what
i
had
done
he
promised
to
assist
me
if
i
would
befriend
him
with
my
father
buli
when
we
returned
to
koiau
i
consented
and
he
hid
me
in
the
house
where
his
sister
lived
i
waited
in
london
for
some
time
until
i
thought
johnson
would
have
given
up
looking
for
me
then
i
asked
captain
jacob
to
write
for
jack
when
he
came
up
the
captain
brought
him
to
me
and
jack
agreed
that
we
should
all
go
back
to
koiau
he
and
captain
shackel
were
both
anxious
to
buy
a
schooner
to
return
in
and
to
use
for
trading
round
the
islands
i
agreed
that
he
should
take
my
pearls
and
sell
them
for
that
purpose
he
got
two
thousand
pounds
for
them
although
they
were
worth
three
but
he
could
not
get
more
with
this
money
and
captain
jacob
savings
they
together
bought
the
that
took
all
the
money
except
such
small
sum
as
was
necessary
to
man
the
ship
and
bring
her
round
here
jack
object
in
coming
to
grimleigh
was
to
get
a
sum
of
money
from
his
uncle
so
that
we
could
procure
some
more
sailors
and
proper
provisions
for
the
voyage
i
did
not
want
to
come
because
i
was
afraid
that
johnson
would
get
hold
of
me
and
take
me
away
from
jack
but
captain
shackel
and
jack
arranged
that
i
should
stay
on
board
the
schooner
until
they
came
ashore
and
got
the
money
and
then
i
could
sail
away
to
koiau
without
any
one
being
the
wiser
i
heard
about
the
murder
but
i
was
frightened
to
come
forward
i
knew
of
course
that
it
was
zara
who
had
been
killed
then
jack
was
arrested
and
captain
shackel
told
me
that
he
wished
me
to
come
and
show
myself
which
i
have
done
finished
tera
with
a
glance
round
the
court
ah
whispered
chard
to
jacob
in
an
angry
tone
so
you
could
read
that
cypher
you
bet
replied
shackel
softly
with
a
wink
read
it
the
moment
you
clapped
it
on
the
table
jack
taught
it
to
me
and
mighty
useful
it
been
no
there
ai
no
fault
to
find
with
the
cypher
here
the
whispering
attracted
the
attention
of
the
magistrate
he
eyed
both
the
inspector
and
jacob
severely
but
proceeded
with
the
case
without
further
rebuke
as
this
girl
was
the
owner
of
the
pearls
he
said
she
had
of
course
a
perfect
right
to
give
them
to
the
accused
as
she
is
here
there
is
obviously
no
case
of
murder
therefore
on
both
charges
the
accused
is
discharged
but
i
feel
i
must
say
a
few
words
about
this
case
whereupon
benker
delivered
a
lecture
upon
tera
wickedness
in
causing
so
much
trouble
by
not
communicating
with
her
guardian
at
this
tera
afraid
of
the
great
chief
as
benker
was
in
her
eyes
began
to
weep
she
upset
the
magistrate
and
upset
his
dignity
he
hastily
discharged
the
prisoner
and
ordered
the
court
to
be
cleared
when
johnson
came
out
he
looked
very
grave
he
walked
up
to
the
girl
bithiah
he
said
reproachfully
you
have
not
treated
me
well
i
am
not
bithiah
replied
tera
her
eyes
sparkling
i
will
call
myself
by
the
name
buli
gave
me
i
am
sorry
if
you
think
i
have
treated
you
badly
but
it
was
your
own
fault
you
need
not
reproach
me
johnson
she
said
in
lower
tones
i
spared
you
in
my
story
the
minister
winced
i
thank
you
for
that
i
suppose
i
have
no
right
to
complain
he
said
bitterly
you
still
intend
to
marry
finland
of
course
she
does
cried
jack
taking
tera
arm
do
you
think
going
to
let
you
take
her
from
me
now
i
have
not
the
power
to
do
so
rejoined
the
preacher
but
brother
brand
will
certainly
demand
that
tera
be
given
back
to
him
he
has
authority
from
buli
to
take
charge
of
her
i
do
not
recognize
it
cried
tera
fiercely
i
refuse
to
go
with
him
if
brother
brand
comes
my
way
i
knock
his
head
off
said
jack
clenching
his
fist
come
along
tera
let
us
go
back
to
the
schooner
wait
said
carwell
coming
up
to
them
i
am
prepared
to
take
tera
under
my
roof
until
you
are
married
i
think
it
would
be
better
put
in
johnson
in
a
low
voice
yes
and
have
brand
after
her
said
jack
no
i
promise
you
that
shall
not
be
she
will
be
safe
with
us
until
she
leaves
as
your
wife
come
jack
you
had
better
agree
will
you
give
me
that
five
hundred
asked
finland
we
will
talk
of
that
later
nephew
in
the
mean
time
is
tera
to
come
with
us
if
you
are
wise
you
will
you
go
tera
yes
replied
the
girl
leaving
jack
arm
for
that
of
his
uncle
i
shall
be
quite
safe
with
carwell
i
shall
marry
no
one
but
you
jack
johnson
could
stand
it
no
longer
turning
on
his
heel
without
a
word
he
walked
away
he
still
loved
the
girl
and
he
realized
that
she
was
lost
to
him
for
ever
in
the
distance
he
espied
a
in
the
person
of
pharaoh
lee
he
too
had
lost
the
girl
he
loved
and
in
a
more
cruel
way
johnson
hastened
up
to
him
and
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
what
are
you
thinking
of
lee
he
asked
with
a
wretched
smile
i
am
thinking
how
to
find
out
zara
husband
and
hang
him
hang
him
yes
said
lee
savagely
she
was
killed
by
her
husband

he
often
wondered
how
he
would
be
able
to
manage
without
his
clever
rachel
her
departure
would
be
a
loss
not
easy
to
replace
household
blessings
like
this
maiden
do
not
grow
on
every
bush
but
rachel
was
not
on
this
particular
day
she
was
sorely
afraid
lest
her
cousin
jack
should
be
committed
for
trial
on
a
charge
of
murder
she
was
very
fond
of
jack
and
although
she
disapproved
of
his
sailorly
ways
she
could
not
believe
him
guilty
of
so
terrible
a
crime
as
she
attended
to
her
household
duties
her
heart
was
heavy
within
her
and
several
times
she
went
to
the
door
in
the
hope
of
seeing
her
father
returning
with
news
but
for
express
wish
she
would
have
gone
to
the
court
herself
at
last
shortly
before
the
meal
she
caught
sight
of
the
trap
turning
in
by
the
distant
gate
she
saw
that
it
contained
three
people
and
ran
to
meet
it
in
the
hope
that
jack
having
been
acquitted
her
father
was
bringing
him
home
as
the
vehicle
came
nearer
rachel
made
out
one
of
the
trio
to
be
a
woman
she
wondered
who
this
third
person
could
be
she
was
not
left
long
in
doubt
here
rachel
lass
called
out
the
farmer
jovially
your
cousin
is
a
free
man
again
and
here
is
a
lady
to
see
you
bithiah
gasped
rachel
turning
white
she
was
too
much
startled
to
express
her
amazement
io√©
said
the
girl
jumping
down
and
throwing
her
arms
round
rachel
neck
but
not
bithiah
any
more
i
am
tera
of
koiau
call
me
so
you
are
not
dead
dead
cried
jack
with
a
joyful
laugh
not
she
tera
still
flesh
and
blood
and
as
pretty
as
ever
do
look
so
scared
cousin
rachel
she
no
ghost
you
must
faint
lass
said
carwell
with
rough
good
nature
tera
is
here
to
stay
until
she
marries
jack
take
her
into
the
house
and
set
her
at
the
table
she
eat
well
i
warrant
and
the
farmer
led
away
the
horse
with
a
jolly
laugh
what
does
it
all
mean
asked
rachel
still
astonished
she
was
not
a
weak
girl
else
she
would
have
fainted
at
the
sudden
of
tera
it
a
long
story
cried
finland
tera
will
tell
it
to
you
rachel
turned
and
kissed
her
cousin
oh
jack
i
so
glad
you
are
free
i
thought
they
would
oh
never
mind
what
does
it
all
matter
now
but
as
tera
is
alive
who
is
the
dead
girl
we
buried
a
gipsy
called
zara
and
who
killed
her
no
one
knows
that
a
new
job
for
chard
come
rachel
take
us
inside
i
as
hungry
as
a
and
tera
looks
as
though
she
could
eat
a
bit
too
come
in
dear
said
rachel
drawing
tera
towards
the
house
i
am
simply
dying
to
hear
what
all
this
means
shortly
afterwards
in
accordance
with
the
manner
of
the
sex
the
two
girls
retired
to
rachel
room
to
exchange
confidences
jack
was
left
alone
and
stood
on
the
front
whistling
he
was
in
the
highest
spirits
and
no
wonder
was
he
not
acquitted
of
a
dangerous
charge
engaged
to
marry
tera
with
the
full
consent
of
his
uncle
part
owner
of
a
ship
after
his
own
heart
and
shortly
sailing
for
the
south
seas
which
he
loved
far
more
than
his
native
land
the
future
was
bright
and
assured
and
finland
although
not
as
a
rule
devotionally
inclined
breathed
a
prayer
of
thankfulness
for
his
good
fortune
there
was
but
one
thing
doubtful
in
his
mind
would
his
uncle
give
him
the
money
he
required
as
he
debated
the
question
farmer
carwell
came
round
the
corner
of
the
house
ready
for
dinner
jack
who
was
prompt
in
all
his
actions
broached
the
subject
there
and
then
uncle
he
said
as
the
old
man
took
a
seat
in
his
armchair
about
this
five
hundred
can
you
let
me
have
it
carwell
was
not
a
mean
man
but
he
was
accustomed
always
to
approach
with
due
caution
anything
in
the
nature
of
a
financial
transaction
therefore
he
did
not
open
his
heart
and
hand
so
readily
as
jack
had
expected
that
requires
some
consideration
my
lad
he
said
after
a
pause
money
is
harder
to
get
than
to
give
you
have
surely
had
plenty
of
time
to
consider
the
matter
uncle
because
i
do
not
ask
you
to
give
me
the
money
but
to
lend
it
to
me
i
pay
it
back
with
interest
the
loan
will
be
as
good
a
thing
for
you
as
for
me
h
you
see
you
offer
no
security
is
my
word
enough
security
cried
jack
flushing
i
am
your
own
sister
son
it
is
not
likely
i
would
swindle
you
softly
my
lad
i
not
accusing
you
of
dishonesty
but
i
never
stretch
out
my
hand
farther
than
i
can
draw
it
back
you
want
five
hundred
pounds
for
use
in
connection
with
your
ship
is
it
yes
the
purchase
of
her
has
taken
all
the
money
i
got
for
the
pearls
and
all
the
skipper
savings
to
boot
we
want
more
men
we
can
easily
get
them
at
grimleigh
she
must
be
provisioned
too
and
that
takes
a
lot
of
cash
then
a
hundred
or
so
in
hand
for
trading
purposes
when
we
reach
the
south
seas
i
ca
make
bricks
without
straw
what
sort
of
trading
will
you
do
oh
copra
and
blackbirding
replied
finland
carelessly
i
a
plain
country
farmer
said
carwell
smiling
and
i
understand
these
terms
you
bring
from
your
new
world
what
is
copra
the
dried
kernel
of
the
it
is
used
for
and
fetches
a
good
price
especially
if
the
kanakas
do
water
it
and
blackbirding
what
is
that
jack
laughed
and
looked
queerly
at
the
old
man
it
was
not
easy
for
him
to
answer
this
question
without
offending
his
uncle
prejudices
however
he
skirted
round
it
and
got
out
of
danger
as
best
he
could
blackbirding
he
said
cautiously
well
you
see
we
sail
for
the
solomons
or
the
new
hebrides
and
pick
up
natives
to
work
on
the
plantations
on
the
more
civilized
islands
they
are
well
looked
after
and
get
good
pay
so
after
a
few
years
they
go
back
to
their
own
land
set
up
for
life
do
the
missionaries
approve
of
this
system
oh
yes
it
brings
savages
from
islands
into
the
circle
of
christianity
and
then
they
can
spread
the
gospel
on
their
own
account
they
are
not
slaves
these
natives
they
are
paid
paid
in
what
we
call
trade
replied
jack
they
hire
themselves
out
for
three
years
as
a
rule
and
when
their
service
is
ended
we
take
them
back
again
with
the
value
of
what
they
have
earned
in
goods
oh
it
square
enough
the
australian
government
appoints
agents
to
see
that
all
is
above
board
does
it
pay
you
bet
uncle
pays
well
let
me
have
that
five
hundred
and
soon
give
it
to
you
again
i
must
take
a
week
to
think
over
it
said
carwell
still
unconvinced
finland
bit
his
lip
and
very
nearly
committed
the
indiscretion
of
rapping
out
a
nautical
oath
but
as
in
that
religious
household
such
language
would
at
once
have
put
an
end
to
all
chances
of
his
getting
the
money
he
was
wise
enough
to
restrain
himself
shortly
after
this
rachel
arrived
with
tera
in
full
possession
of
the
whole
story
the
recital
of
it
had
excited
her
not
a
little
and
during
dinner
she
talked
of
nothing
else
i
suppose
you
will
go
back
with
jack
to
your
own
island
she
said
yes
replied
tera
as
soon
as
we
are
married
by
mr
johnson
johnson
oh
he
wo
marry
us
said
jack
laughing
i
do
see
how
you
can
expect
him
to
tera
he
is
a
minister
he
is
also
a
man
my
dear
observed
rachel
and
he
is
in
love
with
you
let
us
trust
that
our
pastor
will
be
sensible
said
carwell
seriously
now
that
his
ward
has
reappeared
he
is
relieved
from
a
grave
danger
oh
miss
arnott
relieved
him
of
that
before
said
rachel
with
a
trifle
of
feminine
spite
indeed
he
ought
to
marry
her
for
all
she
has
done
for
him
it
would
be
a
good
thing
for
bethgamul
replied
her
father
reflectively
for
miss
arnott
is
wealthy
if
she
became
the
wife
of
our
pastor
she
could
do
much
good
with
her
money
she
is
too
old
to
marry
my
guardian
said
tera
doubtfully
what
does
her
age
matter
child
she
has
a
beautiful
soul
a
minister
should
not
dwell
unduly
on
the
outward
graces
of
womanhood
jack
looked
at
tera
pretty
face
and
laughed
undeniably
it
was
her
comeliness
that
had
attracted
the
minister
not
her
soul
he
was
about
to
make
a
remark
to
this
effect
when
the
sound
of
wheels
was
heard
and
the
excited
accents
of
a
man
with
a
lisp
carwell
went
to
the
door
and
found
inspector
chard
and
moss
descending
from
a
trap
my
dear
thir
cried
the
little
hebrew
running
up
with
outstretched
hands

explained
chard
as
the
boy
came
up
to
take
his
horse
so
i
brought
him
here
to
set
his
mind
at
rest
come
in
come
in
said
carwell
hospitably
tera
and
jack
can
answer
for
themselves

i
shall
be
glad
of
some

ca

a
mouthful

moss
fussing
into
the
house
oh

jack
calmly

them
this

the
jew
fluttering

pearlth

mithter
finland
yes
i
asked
him
to
sell
them
they
were
your
own
pearlth
my
own
pearls
i
received
them
from
my
father
buli
the
moss
leered
and
rubbed
one
fat
hand
against
the
other
i
should
like
to
do
bithness
with
your
father
mith
so
that
thale
ith
all

all

agreed
tera
gravely
you
gave
two
thousand
pounds
for
the
pearls
and
they

to

ah
said
the
hebrew
with
relief
that

pieth
of
advith

again
and
now
he
added
trotting
towards
the
i
can
eat
a
morthel
while
this
matter
was
being
settled
chard
was
talking
to
rachel
about
the
cypher
letter
and
the
cunning
way
in
which
jacob
shackel
had
bamboozled
him
the
old
rascal
wanted
to
make
a
fine
effect
in
court
of
course
said
he
laughing
for
he
might
as
well
have
told
me
at
the
time
that
the
young
lady
was
alive
i
wish
i
had
known
the
cypher
myself
i
must
get
finland
to
show
it
to
me
i
can
do
that
answered
rachel
fishing
in
her
pocket
for
a
pencil
for
it
was
i
who
taught
jack
the
cypher
he
finds
it
useful
in
many
ways
in
business
but
as
he
is
going
to
the
south
seas
i
can
tell
it
to
you
do
you
know
the
game
of
noughts
and
crosses
and
mr
chard
what
do
you
mean
asked
the
inspector
i
show
you
here
is
a
piece
of
paper
observe
now
and
rachel
drew
two
diagrams
which
she
proceeded
to
fill
up
with
letters
illustration
key
to
the
code
page
there
is
the
key
to
the
thing
she
said
you
simply
put
an
angle
for
each
letter
with
a
dot
for
the
one
have
you
the
letter
here
it
is
i
would
not
give
it
to
shackel
rachel
read
it
it
means
tera
to
show
up
arrested
for
her
murder
jack
now
the
first
word
is
and
you
write
it
this
way
and
she
proceeded
to
explain
you
see
the
is
in
the
top
angle
of
the
and
as
it
is
the
letter
you
must
place
a
dot
so
she
placed
a
dot
in
the
top
angle
of
the
diagonal
figure
the
is
formed
in
the
top
angle
of
the
noughts
lastly
the
two
are
in
the
place
under
it
on
the
side
now
look
at
the
whole
word
and
write
the
rest
of
the
message
yourself
chard
took
the
word
jack
and
gradually
grasping
the
idea
wrote
it
down
in
the
characters
by
jove
it
very
neat
he
said
admiringly
and
quite
simple
said
rachel
rising
now
you
really
better
have
some
dinner
mr
chard
thank
you
i
will
but
this
cypher
reminds
me
of
the
assyrian
letters
rather
more
like
hebrew
characters
said
carwell
joining
them
i
wonder
you
did
not
know
of
it
inspector
it
is
in
common
use
it
has
come
my
way
then
laughed
chard
drawing
his
chair
to
the
table
where
already
moss
was
making
up
for
lost
time
during
the
meal
zara
murder
was
the
sole
topic
it
would
seem
that
the
whole
case
would
have
to
be
the
old
trial
had
ended
in
the
discovery
that
tera
had
not
been
murdered
at
all
the
new
one
would
have
to
start
on
fresh
premises
altogether
a
fresh
motive
would
of
course
have
to
be
sought
she
said
nothing
to
you
likely
to
lead
to
the
identification
of
the
assassin
said
the
inspector
addressing
tera
i
do
know
chard
she
said
her
errand
was
to
meet
her
husband
in
the
neighbourhood
but
from
the
way
in
which
she
spoke
i
think
she
expected
him
to
be
very
well
pleased
to
see
her
did
she
mention
his
name
no
she
did
not
i
knew
the
girl
zara
said
jack
unexpectedly
she
was
always
about
with
slade
slade
repeated
chard
drawing
his
brows
together
indeed
is
before
he
could
finish
his
speech
tera
who
had
been
looking
idly
at
the
door
started
to
her
feet
with
an
exclamation
with
one
accord
they
all
followed
her
gaze
for
the
expression
on
her
face
was
one
of
amazement
in
the
doorway
stood
a
tall
man
dressed
in
a
badly
fitting
suit
of
clothes
he
was
staring
hard
at
tera
she
ran
forward
and
seized
his
hand
tolai
she
cried
and
then
uttered
something
in
her
native
tongue
the
man
smiled
nodded
and
bowed
himself
to
the
ground
in
slavish
submission
he
kissed
her
feet
he
was
a
polynesian
chapter
xvii
the
pearl
the
company
gathered
under
farmer
carwell
hospitable
roof
were
naturally
amazed
at
the
unexpected
appearance
of
tera
countryman
jack
who
of
course
had
been
in
koiau
recognized
him
at
once
as
one
of
the
smaller
chiefs
and
came
forward
to
salute
him
so
pleased
was
tolai
at
being
addressed
in
his
native
tongue
that
he
insisted
upon
rubbing
noses
with
finland
much
to
the
amusement
of
rachel
and
her
father
you
good
man
you
savvy
me
said
tolai
in
his
broken
english
i
glad
see
you
jacky
tera
here
she
glad
see
me
i
am
astonished
to
see
you
said
tera
frowning
somewhat
what
has
brought
you
here
viara
she
sent
me
my
mother
said
the
girl
looking
at
tolai
anxiously
why
too
much
devil
in
koiau
replied
the
polynesian
no
help
big
chief
viara
she
say
you
go
misi
johnson
tolai
he
no
shamed
he
go
and
dat
is
here
the
native
stock
of
english
gave
out
and
he
slid
into
a
long
explanation
in
his
own
vernacular
both
jack
and
tera
listened
attentively
what
is
he
talking
about
asked
the
inspector
curiously
tera
explained
it
seemed
that
her
uncle
niga
had
revolted
against
his
brother
buli
and
there
was
trouble
in
the
island
buli
wished
his
followers
to
become
converts
to
christianity
whereas
niga
as
the
head
of
the
heathen
party
desired
to
drive
the
missionaries
from
the
island
viara
the
wife
of
buli
and
mother
of
tera
had
sent
tolai
to
england
to
see
johnson
and
warn
him
of
the
difficulties
tera
might
expect
to
meet
with
on
her
return
tolai
had
embarked
on
a
fruit
schooner
trading
to
sydney
and
from
that
port
he
had
worked
his
way
to
london
before
the
mast
buli
had
given
him
shackel
address
arrived
there
the
captain
sister
having
provided
him
with
money
sent
him
off
to
grimleigh
in
quest
of
johnson
he
had
been
told
that
tera
after
the
trial
had
gone
on
to
carwell
and
thus
he
had
presented
himself
at
the
door
but
there
is
something
else
said
jack
when
tera
had
told
all
this
to
the
company
i
can
see
it
in
the
kanaka
eye
tera
of
course
agreed
with
jack
and
began
to
question
tolai
anew
it
was
soon
evident
that
finland
was
right
the
man
was
keeping
something
back
but
in
spite
of
all
tera
commands
he
refused
to
tell
it
to
any
one
but
johnson
on
learning
this
tera
said
she
would
take
him
to
the
minister
herself
and
set
out
there
and
then
chard
took
the
opportunity
of
putting
a
few
questions
to
pharaoh
lee
touching
his
relations
with
zara
and
moss
at
rest
in
his
mind
about
the
pearls
took
his
departure
from
poldew
bring
back
the
man
to
stay
here
said
carwell
to
tera
as
a
native
he
may
find
difficulty
in
getting
a
bed
in
poldew
thank
you
carwell
i
will
when
they
arrived
at
johnson
house
the
minister
was
surprised
to
see
tera
but
he
was
still
more
surprised
at
the
sight
of
tolai
he
spoke
the
native
tongue
fluently
and
tolai
asked
to
see
him
alone
so
the
preacher
sent
tera
into
the
kitchen
with
his
mother
for
company
in
half
an
hour
time
he
joined
them
and
gave
the
polynesian
a
good
meal
the
minister
was
pale
and
anxious
it
was
evident
that
message
had
been
an
alarming
one
what
is
the
matter
tera
asked
at
once
nothing
nothing
i
have
nothing
to
tell
you
rejoined
johnson
and
he
escaped
back
to
the
study
leaving
tolai
eating
but
tera
was
not
to
be
put
off
in
this
way
she
knew
that
there
was
something
serious
the
matter
and
determined
to
learn
what
it
was
she
followed
her
guardian
into
the
study
as
she
closed
the
door
and
came
forward
with
a
frown
on
her
handsome
face
johnson
looked
at
her
apprehensively
and
made
a
gesture
of
refusal
this
tera
disregarded
altogether
you
do
not
wish
to
tell
me
about
tolai
she
said
in
sharper
tones
than
were
usual
with
her
but
i
must
know
misi
it
is
only
fair
that
i
should
i
can
not
tell
you
now
bithiah
later
on
i
may
do
so
is
it
a
message
from
my
mother
yes
to
me
i
am
not
to
inform
you
until
i
think
fit
the
time
has
not
yet
come
is
the
great
chief
dead
buli
god
forbid
no
he
is
well
and
viara
also
up
to
the
present
niga
has
not
succeeded
in
destroying
our
infant
church
tera
he
added
earnestly
do
not
frown
on
me
my
child
you
know
i
have
your
welfare
at
heart
when
possible
i
will
let
you
know
viara
message
at
present
let
me
tell
you
there
is
nothing
that
need
disquiet
you
tera
looked
at
her
guardian
keenly
and
apparently
her
distrust
passed
away
you
are
a
good
man
misi
i
place
my
heart
in
your
hand
and
now
i
wish
you
to
do
something
for
me
what
is
it
asked
johnson
resting
his
aching
head
on
his
hand
i
wish
you
to
marry
me
to
jack
no
no
i
can
not
do
that
you
ask
me
too
much
misi
tera
knelt
down
beside
johnson
and
seized
his
hand
which
trembled
in
her
grasp
you
must
be
brave
as
you
are
good
i
was
wrong
to
run
away
as
i
did
and
give
you
pain
but
i
feared
you
would
part
me
from
jack
i
love
him
and
i
can
not
love
you
we
wish
to
sail
next
week
for
the
south
seas
for
my
own
island
and
we
must
be
married
before
we
go
you
are
my
friend
my
guardian
you
will
surely
do
me
this
last
kindness
johnson
groaned
curious
to
say
since
tera
had
returned
he
found
that
his
love
was
not
so
strong
as
it
had
been
nevertheless
he
felt
a
pang
at
giving
her
to
another
man
that
his
should
be
the
hand
to
make
them
one
was
too
much
to
ask
he
feared
it
was
beyond
his
strength
but
the
perils
which
he
had
escaped
had
rendered
him
grateful
to
god
for
the
protection
vouchsafed
him
he
felt
that
he
should
exercise
some
make
some
sacrifice
therefore
he
made
up
his
mind
to
curb
this
love
which
overwhelmed
his
soul
and
since
he
could
not
gain
tera
for
himself
to
place
her
under
the
protection
of
a
husband
who
would
make
her
happy
and
protect
her
from
harm
in
koiau
it
would
be
well
that
tera
should
marry
a
christian
for
with
her
own
influence
and
that
of
her
european
husband
they
might
hope
to
do
much
for
the
people
i
will
do
what
you
wish
he
said
in
a
low
voice
i
will
marry
you
to
finland
in
bethgamul
tera
uttered
an
exclamation
of
joy
and
kissed
the
hand
she
held
he
winced
at
that
soft
touch
the
girl
turned
to
go
but
he
stopped
her
before
she
could
reach
the
door
take
tolai
with
you
he
said
gently
io√©
carwell
told
me
to
bring
him
back
never
go
anywhere
without
tolai
not
even
when
i
go
with
jack
not
even
then
said
johnson
decisively
wherever
you
go
tolai
must
be
by
your
side
it
is
viara
wish
i
will
obey
but
why
this
protection
misi
that
you
shall
know
later
at
present
be
content
to
learn
that
viara
wishes
you
to
be
attended
constantly
by
tolai
he
was
sent
to
me
for
that
purpose
now
go
my
dear
we
shall
meet
again
soon
when
tera
left
the
room
johnson
felt
a
strange
calm
stealing
over
him
his
mad
passion
seemed
to
be
wearing
itself
out
by
its
own
violence
no
longer
did
he
feel
despair
when
tera
left
his
side
and
he
hoped
that
when
called
upon
to
fulfil
his
projected
sacrifice
he
would
be
able
to
do
it
with
calmness
and
dignity
it
was
with
a
feeling
of
relief
to
him
that
his
malady
of
the
heart
was
passing
away
soon
he
would
be
a
free
man
would
be
able
to
attend
to
his
religious
duties
as
of
yore
unhindered
by
the
storm
and
stress
of
a
hopeless
love
he
would
return
to
his
studies
to
his
old
meditative
life
but
miss
arnott
as
the
thought
of
her
entered
his
mind
johnson
recalled
his
debts
and
the
burden
of
gratitude
which
she
had
placed
on
his
shoulders
unless
he
could
discharge
that
claim
by
repaying
the
money
she
had
lent
him
and
johnson
knew
not
where
to
obtain
so
large
a
sum
he
feared
the
discharge
would
have
to
take
the
form
of
marriage
the
idea
dismayed
him
still
it
was
not
so
unpalatable
to
him
as
it
had
been
at
this
point
his
meditations
were
interrupted
by
the
appearance
of
slade
who
was
ushered
in
by
his
mother
the
poor
little
black
eyes
were
red
with
weeping
and
she
seemed
to
be
greatly
agitated
terror
struck
at
johnson
heart
for
so
many
ills
had
befallen
him
that
he
quite
expected
more
to
follow
the
sight
of
slade
in
this
tearful
condition
made
him
fear
she
was
a
messenger
of
evil
what
is
the
matter
he
asked
rising
nervously
when
they
were
alone
oh
sir
cried
slade
dropping
limply
into
a
chair
i
know
you
ai
no
parson
of
mine
as
i
was
brought
up
in
the
church
of
england
but
you

only
parson
that
i
can
come
to
for
advice
you
are
her
friend
you
know
whose
friend
that
bithiah
tera
oh
i
do
know
what
her
heathen
name

but

a
minx
if
ever
there
was
one
slade
i
can
not
hear
bithiah
spoken
of
like
this
why
do
you
cry
what
have
you
to
urge
against
her
jeremiah
said
slade
and
began
to
weep
anew
your
husband
said
johnson
beginning
to
feel
impatient
for
after
all
she
did
not
belong
to
bethgamul
what
of
him
he
a
beast
did
you
come
here
to
tell
me
that
i
must
confess
i
take
no
interest
in
your
domestic
affairs
mrs
slade
the
little
woman
eyes
began
to
glitter
with
ominous
fire
now
you
be
nasty
sir
it
all
your
fault
what
is
all
my
fault
jeremiah
goings
on
why
did
you
bring
that
horrid
nigger
girl
as
is
respectable
to
this
place
with
her
dirty
heathen
ways
i
thought
it
was
zara
lovell
lamented
slade
as
he
was
after
but
she
dead
they
tell
me
killed
in
mistake
for
your
heathen
but
it
not
zara
it
never
was
her
though
i
called
her
all
the
names
i
could
lay
my
tongue
to
slade
voice
jumped
an
octave
and
she
shook
with
rage
it
your
bithiah
what

cried
the
minister
now
really
angry
bithiah

engaged
to
marry
finland

to

my
own
knowing

interrupted
slade
tossing
her
head
a
nice
wife

on
with
my
jeremiah
oh

my
request
on
my
business
i

say

the
plot
too
you
want
jeremiah
to
run
away
with
that
girl
but
he
sha
he
sha
i
pull
her
hair
out
johnson
could
not
forbear
a
smile
the
idea
of
coupling
tera
with
the
lanky
policeman
seemed
too
absurd
really
slade
he
exclaimed
with
as
much
composure
as
he
could
command
you
quite
wrong
bithiah
does
not
know
your
ah
the
preacher
jumped
what
is
that
slade
had
stronger
nerves
and
did
not
jump
but
she
also
turned
towards
the
window
it
one
of
them
dratted

said
she
in
an
acidulated
voice
pharaoh

gasped
jemima
the
impertinence

lee
said
the
minister
annoyed
at
the
intrusion
and
may
i
remind
you
that
in
civilized
communities
visitors
usually
enter
by
the
door
i
sorry

but
i
came
in
the
easiest
way
i
could
lee
stepped
into
the
room
i
followed
this
woman
up
here
woman
yourself
fellow
how
dare
you
why
did
you
follow
her
asked
the
preacher
to
prevent
a
quarrel
to
ask
her
about
zara
what
do
i
know
of
your
dirt
said
slade
disdainfully
your
husband
knows
about
her
if
you
do
retorted
pharaoh
but
why
do
i
say
your
husband
as
i
live
i
believe
slade
is
the
husband
of
zara
and
you
i
scratch
your
face
if
you
call
me

slade
jeremiah

your

a
year

that
a
lie

the
woman
i
thought
he
was
but
he
was
i
just
found
out
that
it
was
johnson
nigger
girl
he
was
after
and
i
come
up
to
tell

she

him
too
impossible
ridiculous
i
tell

lee
ferociously
slade

first
and
you
afterwards
i
have
no
doubt
he
murdered
her
to
conceal
that
first
marriage
johnson
uttered
an
exclamation
and
slade
grew
a
trifle
pale
it
ai
true
she
said
vehemently
you
know
it
ai
it
was
this
bithiah
girl
not
zara
why
did
she
give
him
one
of
her
pearls
if

a
scrap
of
newspaper
and
held
it
up
i
found

in
slade

guilt
tera

pearl
to
zara

exchange
for
her
dress
i
believe
slade
killed

pearl
from

dead
body

while
these
things
were
taking
place
in
johnson
study
tera
with
tolai
in
attendance
returned
to
farmer
carwell
as
she
had
promised
her
guardian
to
accept
his
statement
as
sufficient
for
the
moment
she
made
no
attempt
to
question
tolai
the
conversation
was
quite
impersonal
and
dealt
generally
with
island
matters
there
were
friends
and
relatives
to
be
inquired
after
all
sorts
of
things
to
ask
about
the
new
banana
plantations
for
instance
if
the
old
priest
of
lomangatini
was
still
alive
and
what
sort
of
goods
buli
was
getting
from
the
traders
in
return
for
his
copra
to
all
these
tolai
replied
in
the
native
tongue
in
this
grey
island
of
the
west
these
dusky
children
of
the
underworld
delighted
to
talk
of
their
tropical
home
the
girl
was
sick
with
nostalgia
when
again
would
she
see
the
shining
spaces
of
the
blue
seas
the
curve
of
the
white
beaches
the
lines
of
brown
thatched
houses
and
the
palms
bending
their
graceful
heads
as
the
hummed
in
the
vault
of
heaven
jack
and
she
were
going
home
yes
to
their
true
home
as
soon
as
he
could
get
the
wherewithal
from
his
uncle
but
already
he
had
made
known
to
her
the
difficulty
there
was
in
obtaining
it
and
tera
resolved
that
if
he
failed
she
would
try
what
her
blandishments
would
do
she
was
sick
with
the
yearning
to
fly
south
to
the
lands
of
eternal
summer
and
it
was
not
by
mere
want
of
money
she
was
going
to
be
prevented
if
she
could
help
it
are
you
a
christian
tolai
asked
the
girl
as
they
reached
the
brow
of
the
hill
above
grimleigh
she
spoke
in
their
own
tongue
yes
i
am
a
christian
misi
brand
he
taught
me
to
pray
good
misi
brand

in
this
town
have
you
seen
him
no
i
wish
to
see
him
too
viara
likes
that
misi
she
asked
me
to
speak
to
him
about
coming
back
to
koiau
at
this
moment
tera
raised
her
eyes
to
see
a
tall
black
figure
trudging
towards
them
in
the
dust
it
was
mere
coincidence
that
the
figure
proved
to
be
that
of
the
very
man
they
were
speaking
of
she
uttered
an
exclamation
of
surprise
and
this
attracted
the
attention
of
korah
who
was
walking
with
bent
head
as
soon
as
he
recognized
tera
he
came
swooping
down
like
a
crow
and
held
his
arms
wide
as
though
to
embrace
her
my
child
my
sister
he
cried
in
english
i
heard
of
your
wondrous
resurrection
from
the
dead
i
have
just
been
in
quest
of
you
at
farmer

here
his
eyes
fell
on
the
polynesian
tolai
he
cried
with
a
sudden
note
of
fear
in
his
voice
it
can
not
be
tolai
yes
he
comes
from
viara

tera
but
speak
to

no
she
told

nothing
but
that

back
to

looked
at
once
relieved
and
disappointed
what
of
niga
he
said
with
a
glance
at
tera
niga
fights
against
the
big
chief
misi
niga
is
a
bad
man
we
must
convert
him
murmured
brand
rather
to
himself
than
to
tolai
how
can
we
expect
a
worshipper
of

looked
at
the
native
again
and
rather
uneasily
i
will
speak
with

tolai
he
said
with
a
gesture
of
dismissal
then
turning
to
tera
how
glad
i
am
to
see
you

still
alive

child

replied

with
a
toss
of
her
dainty
head
and
i

happy

to
koiau
and
jack
with
me
brand
shook
his
head

tera
her
nostrils
dilating
he
is
a
good
man
and
beautiful
you

no
right
to
speak
to
me
so

me
remind
you
child
that

your
guardian
johnson

my
guardian
he

but
your
father
buli
sent
me
to
england
to

charge
of

therefore
i

your
guardian
now
and
i
intend
to
take

with
me
back
to
koiau
on
the
first
ship
i

tera
loudly

that
if

said
brand
sternly
tera
laughed
and
snapped
her
fingers
i
care
not
she
said
it
was
from
you
and
johnson
i
ran
away
now
you
can
do
nothing

and
carwell
is
quite
pleased
if
you
come
between

jack
will
kill
you
you
talk
big
poof
brand
frowned
he
knew
very
well
that
he
had
no
real
power
and
as
tera
phrased
it
talked
big
finland
was
a
determined
young
fellow
and
as
he
had
johnson
and
carwell
on
his
side
it
would
be
difficult
to
prevent
his
marrying
tera
in
spite
of
all
protest
then
if
brand
returned
to
koiau
where
was
his
interest
there
was
nothing
to
be
gained
by
stern
measures
tera
position
was
too
strong
to
be
shaken
therefore
korah
with
a
smile
that
sat
ill
on
his
rugged
face
altered
his
tone
considerably
you
are
a
wilful
girl
bithiah
and
i
suppose
you
must
have
your
way
but
what
will
buli
say
to
your
taking
a
white
husband
the
great
chief
will
be
pleased
replied
tera
seriously
he
loves
the
haolis
white
men
and
with
jack
i
can
do
great
things
in
koiau
let
us
hope
so
child
so
captain
shackel
is
taking
his
schooner
to
the
island
i
will
ask
him
for
a
passage
oh
yes
misi
let
us
all
go
tolai
jack
you
and
i
i
forgot
tolai
for
the
moment
said
brand
laying
his
hand
on
the
man
shoulder
bithiah
you
can
return
to
brother
carwell
rachel
is
expecting
you
tolai
come
with
me
no
misi
me

return
later
she
does
not
require
you
now
we
are
in
england
you
must
remember
she
is
perfectly
safe
alone
i
no
savvy
that
all
misi
korah
looked
sharply
at
tolai
seeing
that
there
was
some
reason
for
this
obstinacy
but
the
polynesian
face
was
blank
of
expression
and
the
missionary
dropped
the
subject
where
are
you
staying
he
asked
tolai
stays
with
me
at
carwell
said
tera
brother
carwell
is
truly
hospitable
said
korah
well
may
his
house
be
called
well
i
shall
see
you
both
soon
again
i
have
many
things
to
say
to
tolai
about
viara
and
buli
but
i
have
no
time
to
talk
now
toefua
farewell
toefua
misi
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
brand
walked
in
the
direction
of
grimleigh
while
tera
and
her
escort
pursued
their
way
to
bethdagon
here
the
girl
found
jack
impatiently
waiting
for
her
at
the
gate
they
strolled
up
the
path
side
by
side
we
need
not
go
into
the
house
yet
said
finland
rather
disgusted
mayne
is
there
making
love
to
rachel
tera
stopped
and
looked
surprised
does
he
love
rachel
i
suppose
so
he
has
been
hanging
after
her
for
the
last
few
months
i
suppose
it
will
end
in
a
marriage
i
am
sorry
for
that
jack
said
tera
resuming
her
walk
i
do
not
like
mayne
au√©
it
will
be
sad
if
rachel
goes
to
his
house
why
mayne
is
a
bad
sort
of
fellow
i
do
like
him
persisted
the
girl
that
is
a
frozen
fact
you
like
a
sailor
said
finland
dismissing
the
subject
with
a
gay
laugh
where
have
you
been
tera
to
johnson
with
tolai
has
he
delivered
his
message
io√©
but
i
do
not
know
what
it
is
trouble
in
koiau
i
guess
observed
jack
carelessly
that
uncle
niga
of
yours
seems
to
be
raising
cain
generally
niga
he
big
chief
grunted
tolai
catching
the
name
too
big
for
his
boots
if
he
wore
sonny
but
tera
and
i
will
help
buli
to
put
him
straight
when
we
get
to
the
seas
of
the
albatross
i
guess
i
settle
down
as
a
kanaka
when
i
reach
koiau
england
too
dull
and
grey
for
me
i
become
an
blood
brother
of
some
one
and
take
up
the
chieftainship
when
buli
passes
in
his
checks
then
we
enjoy
ourselves
tera
my
girl
ride
on
the
surf
boats
when
the
rollers
rise
high
on
the
reef
walk
in
the
bush
drink
kava
and
take
the
sleep
which
you
ca
get
here
oh
we
have
a
high
old
time
you
bet
my
lass
tolai
could
not
follow
all
that
jack
said
but
every
now
and
then
as
he
caught
a
native
word
familiar
to
him
he
grunted
approval
tera
laughed
loud
for
very
joy
at
the
picture
her
lover
was
painting
and
put
her
arms
round
his
neck
with
you
i
shall
always
be
happy
she
whispered
and
let
me
tell
you
something
love
johnson
has
promised
to
marry
us
at
bethgamul
the
deuce
he
has
got
over
his
sickness
for
you
has
he
i
think
so
at
least
he
will
marry
us
and
then
we
shall
sail
with
captain
jacob
for
our
dear
land
we
must
get
the
dollars
first
tera
and
the
old
man
wo
part
i
ca
get
the
money
from
him
jack
you
let
me
talk
to
your
uncle
as
you
please
but
he
wo
part
oh
yes
i
will
make
him
you
a
clever
lass
if
you
do
but
i
do
see
how
you
intend
to
go
about
it
i
will
make
him
repeated
tera
that
is
enough
and
now
let
us
go
into
the
house
tolai
is
cold
for
the
sun
goes
down
mayne
is
inside
said
jack
hanging
back
for
he
was
enjoying
the
hour
too
much
to
shorten
it
i
know
answered
tera
and
walked
towards
the
farm
i
want
to
see
mayne
and
rachel
too
she
spoke
rather
mysteriously
and
finland
could
not
catch
the
drift
of
her
meaning
however
she
said
nothing
and
the
three
of
them
entered
the
house
together
tolai
bestowed
himself
in
a
corner
where
he
sat
on
the
floor
after
the
fashion
of
his
tribe
keeping
his
faithful
eyes
ever
fastened
on
tera
mayne
and
rachel
were
seated
near
the
window
chatting
and
the
conversation
had
not
been
uninteresting
to
judge
from
rachel
high
colour
and
bright
eyes
finland
guessed
that
herbert
mayne
had
proposed
and
been
accepted
he
nudged
tera
with
a
chuckle
but
the
girl
did
not
respond
to
his
merriment
indeed
she
looked
so
severely
at
herbert
when
she
greeted
him
that
the
young
man
was
quite
disconcerted
he
did
not
look
well
for
his
face
was
colourless
and
his
manner
uneasy
yet
if
rachel
had
accepted
him
and
there
was
no
reason
to
believe
that
she
had
done
otherwise
he
should
surely
have
been
glowing
with
happiness
i
am
glad
to
see
you
again
miss
bithiah
said
he
we
all
mourned
you
as
dead
it
was
a
strange
mistake
mr
mayne
oh
i
should
say
that
the
poor
girl
who
was
murdered
wore
your
clothes
and
as
her
body
was
not
found
for
a
month
the
face
was
not
recognizable
no
one
dreamed
that
the
corpse
was
that
of
a
gipsy
girl
did
not
you
mr
mayne
i
no
replied
herbert
with
frank
surprise
why
should
i
you
knew
this
girl
at
one
time
said
tera
looking
keenly
at
him
the
young
man
flushed
and
laughed
nervously
i
knew
her
as
one
knows
those
sort
of
people
he
said
last
year
her
tribe
camped
on
the
common
near
my
farm
and
zara
that
was
her
name
was
it
not
yes
rejoined
tera
with
some
irony
zara
lovell
was
her
name
well
zara
came
round
to
my
house
a
good
deal
selling
things
and
telling
fortunes
i
saw
her
very
often
so
did
finland
here
oh
i
saw
her
struck
in
jack
a
pretty
girl
she
was
with
a
devil
of
a
temper
jack
cried
rachel
in
a
shocked
tone
how
can
you
i
beg
your
pardon
cousin
but
she
had
a
temper
i
should
have
liked
to
be
hitched
up
her
in
double
harness
you
mean
i
suppose
you
would
not
have
liked
to
marry
her
jack
jack
what
slang
you
use
i
do
cousin
rachel
i
must
mend
my
ways
zara
was
married
said
tera
shortly
she
told
me
so
i
wish
now
i
had
asked
her
about
her
husband
why
asked
mayne
suddenly
because
i
believe
he
knows
something
about
this
murder
oh
tera
cried
rachel
flushing
you
do
think
her
husband
killed
her
poor
thing
no
i
should
be
sorry
to
think
that
but
i
dare
say
he
knows
who
did
i
wonder
who
she
married
said
herbert
reflectively
slade
the
policeman
was
very
sweet
on
her
oh
he
ca
be
her
husband
cried
rachel
vigorously
why
he
has
been
married
almost
a
year
herbert
surely
you
do
think
slade
has
committed
bigamy
i
hope
not
rachel
as
a
policeman
he
should
know
the
danger
of
it
well
interesting
as
this
conversation
is
i
must
be
off
and
herbert
rose
to
his
feet
with
a
yawn
wo
you
stay
to
supper
herbert
asked
rachel
with
a
blush
no
you
have
the
house
full
already
but
i
may
look
in
after
and
smoke
a
pipe
with
the
farmer
mayne
glanced
so
significantly
at
rachel
as
he
made
this
remark
that
tera
felt
sure
he
spoke
in
the
character
of
an
accepted
lover
her
belief
was
strengthened
when
she
saw
rachel
go
to
the
door
with
the
young
man
and
return
with
a
heightened
colour
tera
drew
her
dark
brows
together
and
seemed
displeased
while
rachel
set
out
the
she
talked
to
jack
and
tolai
in
the
most
unconcerned
manner
but
when
rachel
was
about
to
go
to
her
bedroom
to
smarten
herself
up
for
the
meal
she
stopped
her
i
come
with
you
dear
if
i
may
she
said
rising
i
leave
you
jack
to
talk
with
tolai
and
wait
for
farmer
carwell
right
you
are
said
jack
lighting
his
pipe
come
out
for
a
stroll
tolai
we
have
lots
to
talk
about
tera
drew
rachel
into
the
bedroom
and
shut
the
door
then
she
looked
at
her
steadily
and
kissed
her
has
mayne
proposed
she
asked
oh
how
did
you
guess
fluttered
rachel
growing
very
red
yes
dear
he
has
asked
me
to
be
his
wife
and
have
you
promised
to
marry
him
well
i
love
him
very
much
bithiah
and
he
belongs
to
our
congregation
and
he
has
a
nice
farm
and
is
and
ah
i
see
you
said
yes
oh
rachel
flung
her
arms
round
tera
neck
i
am
so
happy
poor
dear
sighed
the
native
girl
and
i
am
about
to
make
you
wretched
rachel
drew
back
in
amazement
make
me
wretched
she
gasped
yes
your
herbert
mayne
is
not
what
you
think
him
not
what
i
think
him
why
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
said
tera
slowly
that
he
has
been
deceiving
you
he
has
been
married
already
zara
the
gipsy
was
his
wife
i
can
prove
it
chapter
xix
the
truth
will
out
when
farmer
carwell
came
home
to
supper
he
found
the
house
in
wild
commotion
on
hearing
tera
intelligence
and
proving
the
truth
of
it
rachel
fainted
away
and
had
recovered
her
senses
only
to
go
from
one
fit
of
hysteria
into
another
she
was
as
deeply
in
love
with
herbert
as
a
girl
of
her
temperament
well
could
be
and
the
discovery
of
his
treachery
rendered
her
for
the
moment
quite
beside
herself
with
mingled
rage
and
grief
now
that
she
knew
the
unhappy
zara
had
been
his
wife
she
was
ready
to
declare
he
had
murdered
the
girl
he
had
grown
tired
of
her
no
doubt
as
men
will
of
the
most
affectionate
of
women
and
had
cast
her
off
when
she
returned
to
assert
her
rights
and
require
their
marriage
to
be
publicly
announced
the
man
had
killed
her
brutally
and
in
cold
blood
all
this
rachel
shrieked
out
with
amazing
vigour
and
it
was
as
much
as
ever
tera
could
do
to
keep
her
in
her
room
for
quite
an
hour
she
raved
like
a
at
the
end
of
that
time
she
seemed
worn
out
her
nervous
energy
had
spent
itself
and
completely
exhausted
she
fell
into
a
deep
sleep
then
only
was
tera
able
to
leave
her
it
was
necessary
she
should
do
so
for
carwell
below
was
clamouring
impatiently
to
know
what
was
amiss
jack
of
course
was
as
much
in
the
dark
as
the
farmer
himself
and
tolai
cut
off
from
all
knowledge
of
these
strange
white
people
crouched
in
a
corner
trembling
to
him
though
a
very
warrior
among
his
own
kind
such
domestic
upheaval
was
all
strange
he
knew
not
what
evil
it
might
portend
and
he
was
scared
no
doubt
by
the
horrors
of
his
own
imagination
whatever
is
the
matter
lass
demanded
carwell
anxiously
and
a
trifle
angrily
is
rachel
ill
she
is
very
ill
but
now
she
sleeps
she
will
be
better
soon
but
carwell
i
have
bad
news
for
you
out
with
it
then
it
wo
improve
for
the
keeping
is
it
about
rachel
it
does
concern
rachel
replied
tera
in
measured
tones
but
it
concerns
also
mr
mayne
mayne
cried
jack
who
was
listening
in
bewilderment
what
about
mayne
he
is
a
bad
man
a
bad
man
echoed
carwell
his
ruddy
face
paling
how
he
asked
rachel
to
become
his
wife
well
there
nothing
wrong
in
that
cried
the
farmer
impatiently
i
saw
long
ago
that
he
was
in
love
with
the
girl
he
has
no
right
to
love
her
carwell
he
is
married
already
married
the
scoundrel
who
is
he
married
to
to
zara
lovell
zara
lovell
repeated
finland
incredulously
while
carwell
sank
back
in
his
armchair
you
must
be
mistaken
tera
how
do
you
know
tera
drew
a
paper
from
her
pocket
and
placed
it
in
the
farmer
hands
i
am
not
mistaken
as
that
certificate
will
prove
zara
as
you
know
changed
clothes
with
me
and
in
her
hurry
i
suppose
forgot
that
her
certificate
of
marriage
was
sewn
in
the
skirt
of
her
dress
i
found
it
when
i
took
off
the
clothes
in
london
i
intended
to
restore
it
to
her
when
i
came
to
grimleigh
but
when
i
found
that
she
had
been
murdered
i
said
nothing
about
it
i
thought
it
better
to
wait
until
i
saw
a
fit
opportunity
that
came
when
rachel
told
me
mayne
had
asked
her
to
marry
him
then
i
told
her
of
his
wickedness
and
proved
it
to
her
by
that
paper
well
if
he
ai
a
mean
white
said
finland
slowly
i
like
to
boot
him
round
his
own
farm
farmer
carwell
did
not
speak
with
white
face
and
angry
eyes
he
was
reading
the
certificate
it
was
dated
a
year
or
more
back
and
it
set
forth
that
herbert
mayne
bachelor
and
zara
lovell
spinster
had
been
at
chesterhope
church
made
man
and
wife
chesterhope
was
a
village
some
twenty
miles
from
poldew
mayne
no
doubt
in
order
that
attention
should
not
be
attracted
had
obtained
a
licence
for
marriage
in
that
parish
with
her
tribe
zara
had
camped
in
most
of
the
neighbouring
districts
she
had
no
doubt
been
resident
in
the
parish
of
chesterhope
for
a
time
more
than
sufficient
to
comply
with
the
regulations
for
a
marriage
licence
he
had
been
a
long
while
in
coming
to
the
point
with
rachel
here
it
appeared
was
good
cause
for
it
but
now
that
tera
had
returned
now
that
he
knew
that
zara
and
not
she
was
the
victim
of
the
murder
he
had
lost
no
time
in
putting
the
crowning
point
to
his
duplicity
curse
him
said
carwell
crushing
up
the
paper
in
his
hand
he
was
a
good
man
an
elder
of
bethgamul
and
he
rarely
swore
but
he
knew
well
the
misery
mayne
base
conduct
would
cause
his
daughter
and
now
he
did
swear
freely
had
herbert
been
in
the
room
that
moment
assuredly
the
outraged
farmer
would
have
treated
him
to
no
great
c√¶sar
said
jack
drawing
a
long
breath
what
a
knave
should
wonder
if
he
killed
the
girl
no
no
cried
tera
sharply
he
is
bad
enough
without
our
making
him
out
worse
he
did
not
do
that
i
not
so
sure
said
carwell
slowly
he
was
recovering
his
presence
of
mind
the
girl
told
bithiah
that
she
had
returned
to
meet
her
husband
mayne
was
then
courting
rachel
remember
and
the
sight
of
his
wife
would
no
doubt
anger
him
it
is
quite
possible
he
may
have
made
up
his
mind
to
put
her
out
of
his
way
but
zara
was
strangled
by
a
cord
taken
from
johnson
study
cried
tera
how
and
when
could
he
have
come
by
that
oh
easy
enough
said
finland
mayne
was
often
in
that
study
it
would
not
be
any
tough
job
for
him
to
collar
that
curtain
cord
but
where
would
be
his
reason
remember
he
did
not
know
that
zara
was
coming
back
to
grimleigh
argued
tera
she
told
me
she
was
going
to
surprise
her
husband
no
if
he
did
kill
zara
which
i
very
much
doubt
it
was
in
a
fit
of
rage
he
did
it
we
will
question
the
man
himself
said
carwell
rising
heavily
from
his
seat
my
poor
rachel
this
is
terrible
for
her
i
see
this
man
and
wring
the
truth
from
him
i
a
mind
to
go
to
him
now
there
no
need
for
that
uncle
interposed
the
sailor
he
told
rachel
he
was
coming
here
after
supper
he
probably
be
here
in
an
hour
or
so
let
wait
for
him
there
may
as
well
be
as
many
witnesses
as
possible
to
the
skunk
confessions
you
come
along
uncle
and
have
some
supper
it
ready
and
you
be
the
better
for
it
i
could
not
eat
a
mouthful
muttered
carwell
resuming
his
seat
go
you
and
eat
jack
you
and
bithiah
with
that
heathen
of
yours
go
and
see
rachel
no
please
do
said
tera
anxiously
she
is
sleeping
beautifully
now
you
will
only
make
her
ill
again
if
you
wake
her
poor
lass
poor
lass
murmured
the
farmer
then
he
relapsed
into
a
state
of
silence
indifferent
utterly
to
what
was
going
on
around
him
beckoned
to
by
tera
the
kanaka
still
greatly
troubled
by
this
mystery
and
trouble
crept
out
of
his
corner
he
seated
himself
timidly
at
the
table
with
the
other
two
and
managed
to
make
a
good
meal
even
though
the
viands
placed
before
him
were
probably
weird
and
strange
to
him
nobody
spoke
save
in
an
occasional
whisper
and
the
time
dragged
wearily
on
jack
sought
solace
in
his
pipe
and
tolai
crawled
back
to
his
corner
tera
went
upstairs
to
rachel
room
to
see
if
she
were
still
asleep
she
slept
soundly
tera
did
not
disturb
her
but
she
returned
to
the
as
she
came
down
the
stairs
she
heard
a
cheery
whistle
from
outside
then
the
tread
of
rapidly
approaching
footsteps
and
finally
a
sharp
at
the
door
tera
went
to
open
it
and
with
a
smile
on
his
face
herbert
stepped
into
the
room
the
lamplight
seemed
to
dazzle
him
here
i
am
he
said
tossing
down
his
cap
i
earlier
than
usual
but
i
could
keep
away
any
longer
he
did
not
appear
to
notice
anything
was
wrong
he
approached
farmer
carwell
has
rachel
not
told
you
farmer
our
news
where
is
she
carwell
said
nothing
but
stretching
out
a
huge
paw
gripped
the
man
by
the
shoulder
and
drew
him
towards
the
table
into
the
bright
glare
of
the
lamp
he
placed
the
certificate
on
the
cloth
before
eyes
and
silently
pointed
to
it
mayne
started
and
gasped
something
seemed
to
catch
in
his
throat
and
he
became
inarticulate
you
scoundrel
said
carwell
between
his
teeth
do
you
know
that
paper
yet
you
dare
to
make
love
to
my
child
you
you
you
murderer
i
i
i
am
no
murderer
faltered
herbert
down
whose
pallid
face
the
perspiration
rolled
in
great
drops
i
did
not
kill
her
carwell
shook
him
fiercely
say
your
wife
you
dog
you
i
did
not
kill
my
wife
i
wonder
why
i
do
slay
you
as
you
stand
cried
the
farmer
his
huge
frame
towering
over
the
shrinking
form
of
the
culprit
you
have
ruined
my
daughter
life
with
your
lies
i
would
he
stopped
and
burst
into
a
harsh
contemptuous
laugh
cur
that
you
are
you
are
not
worth
an
honest
man
soiling
his
hands
out
of
my
sight
with
you
he
dashed
the
man
from
him
violently
on
the
floor
herbert
lay
a
pitiable
object
while
the
farmer
stood
over
him
fighting
down
a
fierce
desire
to
kick
him
jack
and
tera
looked
on
in
silence
slowly
herbert
gathered
himself
together
and
staggering
to
his
feet
groped
blindly
to
the
far
end
of
the
room
he
knew
that
he
was
detected
and
he
could
neither
deny
nor
excuse
his
conduct
much
less
show
a
fighting
front
to
the
man
who
had
a
right
to
call
him
to
account
for
it
all
he
wished
to
do
was
to
get
away
out
of
the
house
away
from
the
scene
of
his
disgrace
lest
worse
should
befall
blindly
he
felt
for
his
cap
and
made
to
leave
stop
thundered
carwell
this
girl
zara
was
your
wife
yes
dropped
from
herbert
lips
almost
in
a
whisper
did
you
kill
her

i
swear
i
did
not
on
my

carwell
he
turned
again
to
mayne
i
know
not
whether
you
are
a
cain
or
not
vagabond
that
you
are
but
mark

down
i
herbert
cast
a
terrified
glance
around
at
that
moment
the
noise
of
wheels
and
loud
voices
was
heard
he
seemed
to
think
the
officers
of
justice
were
already
on
his
track
with
a
rush
he
was
at
the
door
jack
sprang
forward
to
catch
him
but
mayne
flung
open
the
door
and
dashed
out
into
the
night
only
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
slade
back
whence
he
had

and
despairing
with
shrill
clamour
slade
bounced
forward
to
explain
their
intrusion
to

he
asked

i

to

his
wife
said
pharaoh
darting
forward
is
he
zara
husband
here
is
the
certificate
replied
jack
handing
it
to
him
that
seems
to
say
so
his
wife
wailed
a
voice
as
pharaoh
read
the
paper
and
at
the
door
stood
rachel
with
outstretched
arms
rachel
cried
the
wretched
young
man
and
in
a
wild
effort
to
escape
her
reproaches
he
again
made
for
the
door
hardly
had
he
laid
his
hand
on
the
latch
when
pharaoh
threw
down
the
certificate
and
sprang
on
him
rachel
shrieked
and
rushed
forward
as
the
two
men
swayed
and
swung
with
clenched
teeth
but
her
father
caught
her
in
his
arms
and
forced
her
back
into
his
chair
slade
fell
on
her
knees
with
a
whimper
and
jack
and
the
policeman
endeavoured
to
part
mayne
and
the
gipsy
at
that
moment
they
saw
the
glitter
of
a
knife
one
flash
and
the
weapon
was
driven
home
pharaoh
withdrew
the
knife
and
tossed
it
at
rachel
feet
his
victim
was
prone
on
the
floor
a
spout
of
blood
gushing
from
his
breast
take
your
lover
he
cried
and
before
the
spectators
could
move
he
had
opened
the
door
and
disappeared
chapter
xx
what
tera
knew
ill
news
travels
fast
slade
and
his
wife
brought
the
tragic
tidings
to
grimleigh
that
night
and
by
morning
the
whole
town
was
in
possession
of
a
distorted
version
of
the
facts
the
milkman
reported
his
own
particular
rendering
of
the
affair
to
miss
arnott
servant
who
in
her
turn
informed
her
mistress
miss
arnott
feeling
that
the
minister
should
be
notified
put
on
her
hat
and
called
on
him
she
was
shown
into
the
and
found
johnson
making
a
hurried
breakfast
preparatory
to
departing
for
bethdagon
carwell
had
sent
a
special
messenger
to
bring
him
up
i
know
all
about
it
miss
arnott
he
said
when
the
lady
entered
it
is
very
terrible
but
i
am
glad
to
say
that
there
is
every
chance
of
mayne
recovery
i
thought
he
was
dying
no
brother
carwell
messenger
informs
me
that
lee
knife
pierced
no
vital
part
the
man
will
recover
let
us
hope
that
he
will
repent
of
his
sins
and
lead
a
new
life
amen
to
that
said
miss
arnott
softly
and
the
gipsy
he
is
still
at
large
it
will
not
be
easy
for
the
police
to
catch
pharaoh
the
man
knows
the
country
as
i
know
this
room
i
hope
they
wo
catch
him
cried
miss
arnott
with
a
defiant
look
wicked
as
lee
has
been
mayne
is
worse
pharaoh
had
great
provocation
to
kill
him
eye
for
an
eye
a
tooth
for
a
tooth
johnson
if
mayne
murdered
this
unhappy
girl
whom
he
made
his
wife
it
is
right
that
he
should
suffer
is
mine
said
johnson
solemnly
you
know
the
text
pharaoh
had
no
right
to
take
the
law
into
his
own
hands
perhaps
not
but
mayne
robbed
him
of
the
woman
he
loved
and
no
doubt
he
lost
his
head
for
the
moment
love
is
capable
of
all
things
you
are
right
said
the
minister
bitterly
as
he
thought
of
his
own
sad
romance
god
knows
we
are
but
weak
reeds
blown
by
the
wind
but
we
do
not
know
yet
if
mayne
is
guilty
of
zara
death
i
have
still
to
hear
the
true
version
from
farmer
carwell
let
me
know
when
you
return
remarked
miss
arnott
rising
then
after
a
pause
she
added
and
all
these
troubles
have
arisen
from
bithiah
coming
to
stay
with
you
i
am
afraid
so
let
us
hope
they
will
end
with
her
going
next
week
i
celebrate
the
ceremony
of
her
marriage
with
finland
as
they
both
leave
grimleigh
in
the
will
her
departure
break
your
heart
asked
miss
arnott
sarcastically
johnson
reddened
i
once
thought
it
would
he
said
in
a
low
voice
and
do
you
feel
as
you
did
no
i
do
not
that
folly
is
at
an
end
before
her
supposed
death
she
was
all
in
all
to
me
now
i
contemplate
her
marriage
with
finland
at
least
without
distress
a
smile
of
relief
and
joy
irradiated
the
face
of
miss
arnott
the
burden
of
years
seemed
to
fall
from
her
shoulders
and
her
eyes
brightened
like
those
of
a
young
girl
with
a
swift
motion
she
gathered
her
shawl
round
her
graceful
figure
and
stepped
lightly
towards
the
door
go
on
your
errand
of
mercy
she
said
in
low
tones
and
when
you
return
come
to
me
miss
arnott
miss
arnott
called
the
minister
nervously
but
she
was
gone
and
he
could
not
summon
up
courage
to
follow
her
when
johnson
was
on
his
road
to
bethdagon
he
thought
less
of
his
errand
than
was
consistent
with
the
interest
it
had
for
him
the
last
words
of
miss
arnott
rang
in
his
ears
the
look
on
her
face
was
constantly
before
his
eyes
he
knew
well
that
his
confession
had
inspired
her
with
a
new
hope
and
he
did
not
know
exactly
what
to
think
of
it
his
love
for
tera
had
not
been
transferred
to
miss
arnott
yet
the
woman
had
done
him
a
great
kindness
in
the
most
delicate
manner
he
was
her
debtor
to
a
large
amount
in
money
and
in
gratitude
yet
he
could
see
no
way
save
one
of
repaying
her
that
way
he
hesitated
to
take
he
respected
her
but
he
had
no
love
to
bestow
and
he
pursued
his
journey
agitated
in
his
mind
as
to
what
he
had
best
do
under
such
untoward
circumstances
if
johnson
had
been
a
strong
man
with
a
character
he
would
have
decided
at
once
and
held
by
his
decision
but
he
was
gentle
and
loth
to
give
pain
it
was
a
knowledge
of
this
instability
that
made
miss
arnott
so
persistent
in
her
determination
the
woman
knew
that
in
the
end
she
would
gain
her
heart
desire
the
man
had
an
inkling
of
it
too
yet
fought
and
argued
and
held
back
in
the
vain
effort
to
avoid
the
inevitable
poor
johnson
he
was
good
and
lovable
and
but
he
lacked
the
strength
to
be
a
hero
yet
in
his
weakness
was
he
not
more
heroic
than
many
in
their
strength
farmer
carwell
was
waiting
for
the
minister
he
looked
much
older
for
the
terrible
experiences
of
the
previous
night
had
proved
a
severe
shock
to
his
nerves
jack
he
informed
johnson
had
gone
to
the
schooner
in
answer
to
a
message
from
shackel
tera
was
looking
after
the
house
so
far
as
she
was
able
in
her
untrained
way
and
rachel
was
nursing
herbert
nursing
herbert
repeated
johnson
for
this
was
the
last
news
he
expected
to
hear
has
she
forgiven
him
carwell
did
not
reply
at
once
he
brought
out
two
chairs
and
planted
them
in
a
shady
corner
where
the
sun
was
strong
i
do
know
if
she
has
forgiven
him
he
said
when
they
were
seated
women
are
strange
in
their
affections
and
rachel
is
no
exception
mayne
has
done
her
a
cruel
wrong
and
if
he
were
in
his
usual
health
and
strength
i
do
not
think
she
would
let
him
come
near
her
but
now
he
is
laid
low
she
will
hardly
leave
his
bedside
she
would
not
even
let
him
be
removed
to
his
own
house
i
was
unwilling
that
the
scoundrel
should
stay
here
but
rachel
insisted
and
so
i
gave
way
is
he
dying
no
i
do
think
he
will
die
men
like
mayne
never
do
meet
the
reward
of
their
evil
deeds
you
remember
the
text
of
the
flourishing
like
a
green
brother
johnson
as
like
as
not
he
will
recover
so
the
doctor
says
then
added
carwell
with
a
bitter
smile
i
suppose
rachel
will
marry
him
will
you
allow
her
to
do
so
what
can
i
do
to
prevent
it
she
is
of
age
and
can
act
as
best
pleases
her
i
might
threaten
to
disinherit
her
but
she
is
so
infatuated
with
the
scoundrel
that
she
would
not
care
if
she
went
to
him
penniless
and
he
is
well
off
in
this
world
goods
you
know
yes
i
believe
she
will
marry
him
unless
chard
proves
him
guilty
of
murdering
his
wife
do
you
think
he
really
killed
her
asked
johnson
doubtfully
bithiah
says
he
did
not
but
i
can
not
see
how
she
knows
slade
declares
that
herbert
met
zara
on
that
night
and
obtained
from
her
the
pearl
which
bithiah
gave
her
for
the
clothes
herbert
so
that
rachel
might
not
know
of
his
meeting
bribed
slade
with
the
pearl
slade
should
be
punished
for
his
act
i
think
he
will
be
replied
carwell
mr
inspector
was
here
and
he
intends
to
report
him
at
headquarters
so
that
is
all
slade
has
gained
by
her
jealousy
it
was
her
discovery
of
the
pearl
which
led
to
this
she
is
satisfied
now
that
he
is
innocent
and
had
nothing
to
do
either
with
bithiah
or
zara
but
she
has
lost
him
his
employment
slade
must
have
known
that
the
dead
girl
was
zara
yes
i
believe
he
did
for
he
saw
her
meet
mayne
in
clothes
and
recognized
her
face
in
the
moonlight
the
scoundrel
accepted
the
bribe
to
hold
his
tongue
and
did
so
in
the
face
of
all
the
trouble
you
got
into
brother
johnson
not
only
that
rejoined
the
minister
resentfully
but
he
actually
worked
against
me
in
order
to
implicate
me
in
the
supposed
murder
of
bithiah
he
tried
to
make
out
that
i
had
taken
from
my
study
the
cord
with
which
the
girl
was
strangled
by
the
way
who
did
take
the
cord
i
do
know
it
might
have
been
mayne
he
was
frequently
in
my
study
no
rejoined
carwell
after
a
moment
thought
i
do
not
believe
mayne
did
so
bithiah
very
truly
says
that
if
he
did
kill
the
girl
he
must
have
done
so
in
a
passion
in
that
case
he
would
hardly
have
got
the
cord
beforehand
for
the
commission
of
a
crime
which
at
the
time
never
entered
his
mind
bad
as
the
man
is
i
think
he
is
innocent
of
murder
it
could
not
have
been
slade
certainly
not
slade
had
no
motive
to
kill
the
girl
zara
was
not
married
to
him
but
to
mayne
what
about
pharaoh
lee
oh
he
was
in
the
north
when
zara
was
there
replied
carwell
and
if
he
were
guilty
he
would
hardly
have
sought
the
assistance
of
the
poldew
police
no
i
ca
think
who
is
the
guilty
person
time
will
show
said
johnson
rising
has
pharaoh
been
caught
yet
i
hear
the
police
are
after
him
they
might
as
well
try
to
catch
a
flash
of
lightning
said
carwell
gloomily
lee
has
had
twelve
hours
start
of
them
and
now
he
has
accomplished
his
vengeance
i
do
not
think
he
will
be
seen
in
these
parts
again
i
hope
he
will
go
free
added
the
farmer
unconsciously
echoing
the
wish
of
miss
arnott
after
all
he
only
gave
mayne
what
he
deserved
brother
carwell
that
is
not
the
speech
of
a
christian
perhaps
not
but
it
is
hard
to
be
a
christian
under
the
circumstances
clearly
parmer
carwell
character
and
temper
had
not
improved
under
the
trouble
that
had
come
upon
him
yet
johnson
in
spite
of
his
sacred
profession
did
not
feel
called
upon
to
reprove
the
old
man
over
much
to
know
that
his
only
child
loved
a
proven
scoundrel
and
wished
to
marry
him
was
provocation
indeed
and
rachel
in
the
face
of
all
she
knew
declared
her
intention
of
becoming
mayne
wife
when
he
recovered
she
had
a
thousand
excuses
for
his
conduct
men
are
weak
said
rachel
when
her
father
tried
to
reason
her
out
of
this
infatuation
and
herbert
is
no
worse
than
the
rest
of
them
that
girl
zara
tempted
him
and
he
fell
it
was
honourable
of
him
to
make
her
his
wife
i
dare
say
he
need
not
have
done
so
rachel
rachel
is
it
my
child
who
speaks
thus
i
love
herbert
more
than
my
own
soul
answered
rachel
and
from
this
strange
perverse
attitude
she
could
not
be
moved
for
the
next
two
or
three
days
herbert
life
hung
as
by
a
thread
the
doctor
almost
gave
him
up
but
in
the
end
he
rallied
his
own
strong
constitution
and
rachel
tender
nursing
prevailed
and
he
slowly
grew
stronger
then
he
repented
and
wept
in
his
weakness
implored
rachel
not
to
leave
him
and
declared
that
it
was
for
her
sake
that
he
had
bribed
slade
rachel
required
little
persuasion
to
believe
in
these
protestations
which
were
perhaps
quite
sincere
base
as
herbert
had
proved
himself
to
be
he
truly
loved
her
and
knowing
this
she
promised
to
marry
him
as
soon
as
he
could
leave
his
bed
although
carwell
anticipated
that
her
obstinacy
would
lead
to
this
result
he
was
in
despair
at
the
prospect
of
its
realization
as
the
days
went
by
inspector
chard
made
all
search
for
lee
but
failed
to
find
a
trace
of
him
from
the
moment
he
ran
out
into
the
night
the
man
had
not
been
seen
his
tribe
knew
nothing
of
him
or
said
they
knew
nothing
and
although
the
police
scoured
the
country
for
miles
around
no
trace
of
the
fugitive
could
be
discovered
then
chard
relaxed
his
search
and
began
to
pay
frequent
visits
to
the
farmhouse
to
make
inquiries
after
herbert
health
rachel
scented
the
danger
why
do
you
ask
so
often
about
herbert
she
demanded
one
day
i
wish
to
know
when
it
will
be
safe
to
remove
him
to
poldew
gaol
said
the
inspector
frankly
rachel
was
not
so
astonished
at
this
reply
as
might
have
been
expected
you
accuse
him
of
the
murder
said
she
scornfully
yes
and
i
intend
to
arrest
him
on
suspicion
mayne
had
a
reason
for
ridding
himself
of
the
girl
and
he
was
the
last
person
to
see
her
alive
and
i
believe
he
is
guilty
of
her
death
however
that
can
be
proved
when
he
is
tried
you
intend
to
arrest
him
then
yes
as
soon
as
the
doctor
says
he
can
be
moved
rachel
said
no
more
at
the
time
for
she
might
as
well
have
attempted
to
persuade
a
block
of
granite
to
mercy
as
chard
the
inspector
had
been
taunted
with
his
failure
in
this
case
and
his
pride
was
hurt
he
believed
herbert
was
guilty
in
spite
of
the
young
man
denial
and
rejoiced
that
he
had
survived
pharaoh
knife
to
be
punished
for
his
crime
but
if
he
was
determined
to
arrest
mayne
rachel
was
equally
resolved
to
save
her
lover
she
was
certain
of
herbert
innocence
but
saw
no
way
of
proving
it
then
it
struck
her
that
tera
might
know
the
truth
and
to
tera
she
went
for
information
the
polynesian
girl
was
wretched
enough
herself
at
the
moment
for
in
spite
of
all
her
cajoling
carwell
sternly
refused
to
give
his
nephew
the
needful
five
hundred
pounds
tera
was
in
despair
as
she
saw
her
stay
at
grimleigh
prolonged
for
an
indefinite
period
bithiah
said
rachel
in
desperation
the
inspector
says
that
herbert
is
guilty
and
i
am
sure
he
is
not
can
you
help
me
to
prove
his
innocence
i
would
do
anything
give
anything
to
save
him
tera
looked
up
alertly
jack
wants
five
hundred
pounds
she
said
will
you
persuade
your
father
to
give
it
to
him
if
i
tell
you
who
killed
zara
i
know
who
did
it
you
know
tell
me
oh
dear
bithiah
tell
me
no
i
want
that
money
for
jack
then
i
tell
cruel
cruel
girl
mercenary
i
am
not
mercenary
retorted
tera
haughtily
if
i
can
help
jack
why
should
i
not
do
so
besides
if
i
help
you
you
should
help
me
get
me
the
five
hundred
from
your
father
and
my
father
will
not
give
the
money
then
i
hold
my
tongue
herbert
life
depends
upon
your
speaking
out
jack
future
depends
upon
my
holding
my
tongue
said
tera
with
a
sigh
and
in
more
ways
than
one
well
if
you
will
only
do
it
for
money
i
will
give
it
to
you
myself
cried
rachel
my
mother
left
me
six
hundred
pounds
some
of
it
is
invested
but
the
greater
part
of
it
is
in
the
bank
at
poldew
i
can
give
you
a
cheque
now
if
you
will
speak
out
i
speak
out
i
save
herbert
said
tera
excitedly
only
give
me
the
money
disgusted
with
such
avarice
on
the
part
of
tera
but
reflecting
that
she
had
to
do
with
a
being
rachel
left
the
room
and
shortly
returned
with
a
cheque
take
it
to
the
bank
and
you
will
get
the
money
i
must
see
the
money
in
cash
said
tera
cunningly
i
wo
speak
till
then
let
us
drive
into
poldew
this
afternoon
then
replied
rachel
impatiently
and
you
can
get
the
money
yourself
and
let
me
tell
you
bithiah
i
would
not
give
you
this
money
so
readily
unless
i
had
already
determined
to
give
it
to
jack
my
father
refuses
to
lend
it
but
i
am
willing
to
do
so
as
i
know
jack
will
give
it
to
me
again
when
he
makes
money
in
the
south
seas
so
long
as
jack
gets
the
money
to
go
to
koiau
i
do
care
if
you
give
it
or
lend
it
replied
tera
sullenly
i
am
only
anxious
to
get
away
rachel
said
nothing
but
left
the
room
to
give
directions
about
herbert
so
that
he
might
be
well
attended
during
her
absence
shortly
the
two
girls
were
driving
to
poldew
with
tolai
behind
them
for
the
polynesian
utterly
refused
to
leave
his
mistress
the
money
was
obtained
in
gold
as
tera
wished
and
this
packed
in
a
little
wooden
box
corded
and
sealed
was
placed
in
the
trap
now
said
tera
gleefully
let
us
drive
to
grimleigh
and
take
the
money
to
jack
he
is
on
board
the
schooner
as
they
drove
off
rachel
could
no
longer
restrain
her
impatience
now
then
she
said
when
they
were
out
of
the
town
who
killed
zara
tera
who
was
driving
shook
the
reins
with
a
careless
laugh
oh
she
said
coolly
i
killed
her
myself
chapter
xxi
the
end
does
not
always
justify
the
means
when
tera
made
the
astounding
statement
that
she
it
was
who
had
killed
zara
poor
rachel
laughed
incredulously
she
thought
the
girl
was
joking
and
she
felt
she
could
in
nowise
appreciate
such
humour
she
was
really
angry
it
is
too
bad
of
you
bithiah
she
said
flushing
did
you
get
that
money
out
of
me
did
you
take
me
from
herbert
only
to
talk
in
this
silly
manner
you
should
know
enough
of
english
life
by
this
time
to
behave
yourself
i
do
like
such
jokes
tera
shrugged
her
shoulders
in
a
way
she
had
picked
up
at
school
and
flicked
the
horse
i
am
not
joking
she
said
calmly
i
did
kill
zara
i
can
not
believe
it
cried
rachel
in
horror
just
as
you
please
but
i
am
telling
you
the
truth
tera
bithiah
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
strangled
zara
io√©
said
tera
pettishly
how
often
am
i
to
speak
rachel
looked
at
her
in
horror
she
knew
that
in
spite
of
her
veneer
of
civilization
this
native
girl
was
a
savage
at
heart
doubtless
she
thought
no
more
of
taking
a
human
life
than
an
ordinary
person
would
of
killing
a
fly
but
it
was
terrible
to
hear
her
admit
the
fact
so
calmly
in
spite
of
the
conviction
which
was
stealing
over
her
that
tera
spoke
the
truth
rachel
tried
her
best
to
fight
against
it
i
can
not
believe
it
i
can
not
she
kept
repeating
you
would
not
be
so
cruel
i
was
not
cruel
she
died
very
quietly
i
pulled
the
cord
tightly
and
she
was
gone
and
tera
with
a
at
her
companion
chirrupped
to
the
horse
she
spoke
quite
frankly
for
besides
rachel
who
had
paid
her
five
hundred
pounds
for
this
information
there
was
only
tolai
in
the
back
seat
to
hear
her
and
even
if
the
polynesian
had
been
able
to
understand
her
she
was
in
no
danger
from
him
rachel
shrank
back
from
the
girl
with
terror
bithiah
in
god
name
why
did
you
kill
her
she
had
done
you
no
harm
no
but
i
was
afraid
she
would
talk
about
our
changing
dresses
and
johnson
would
follow
me
i
thought
it
best
to
kill
her
said
tera
calmly
i
do
believe
you
cried
rachel
again
you
are
making
this
up
a√ºe
what
trouble
you
make
over
this
dead
one
if
in
my
island
we
talked
so
over
every
one
who
was
killed
why
tera
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
continued
more
earnestly
listen
i
will
tell
you
all
i
met
zara
in
the
field
and
i
gave
her
a
pearl
that
i
might
wear
her
dress
we
changed
and
i
was
going
away
then
i
thought
she
might
betray
me
and
then
misi
brand
would
come
after
me
i
was
sorry
i
had
not
killed
her
i
had
no
knife
or
club
and
i
was
not
strong
enough
to
strangle
her
with
my
hands
then
i
remembered
i
had
a
cord
of
silk
i
took
this
off
the
curtain
in
johnson
study
some
days
before
it
was
blue
red
and
white
very
pretty
and
i
used
it
to
tie
round
my
waist
i
gave
it
to
zara
when
we
changed
clothes
i
could
have
killed
her
with
that
and
was
sorry
i
had
not
done
so
that
she
might
tell
no
stories
of
me
and
part
me
from
jack
but
she
was
gone
so
i
walked
on
then
i
went
back
to
the
field
to
kill
her
gasped
rachel
io√©
to
kill
her
answered
tera
serenely
but
i
could
not
do
so
at
first
for
she
was
talking
to
mayne
then
she
left
him
he
went
down
to
grimleigh
and
zara
came
towards
me
crying
when
she
saw
me
she
ran
up
and
asked
me
for
her
certificate
of
marriage
which
was
sewn
in
her
dress
she
had
forgotten
it
i
saw
a
chance
then
i
asked
her
to
give
me
back
the
silk
cord
which
she
had
round
her
waist
she
gave
it
to
me
at
once
and
ripped
the
certificate
out
of
the
skirt
of
her
dress
which
i
wore
as
she
bent
down
to
do
so
i
threw
the
cord
round
her
neck
she
died
very
quietly
said
tera
musingly
i
do
not

she
felt
pain
when
she
was
dead
i
dragged
her
along
by
the
fence
into
the
corn
a
good
way
in
so
that
her
body
might
not
be
seen
after

rachel

seized

with

other
and
held

to
her
seat

said
fiercely

will
tell
tolai

quiet

i
tell
you

to
save

truth

statements

tera
what

she
pulled
up
the
horse
with
a
jerk
but
do
not
speak
yet
if
you
do
i
will
say
you
you
will
be
sorry
that
all
wait
till
i
give

the
paper
and
sail
away
with
my
dear
jack
you
hear
yes
yes
said
rachel
her
teeth
chattering
with
fright
at
this
exhibition
of
tera
savagery
i
will
say
nothing
not
a
word
good
you
can
go
then
i
drive
on
to
grimleigh
and
go
on
board
the
schooner
where
i
shall
be
safe
i
shall
not
return
and
the
trap
i
will
leave
to
some
one
to
take
back
rachel
trembling
violently
scrambled
down
as
best
she
could
in
her
terror
she
believed
that
tera
might
order
tolai
to
kill
her
it
was
a
strange
experience
to
be
at
the
mercy
of
two
bloodthirsty
savages
on
a
quiet
english
road
without
a
word
she
picked
up
her
skirts
and
ran
back
only
anxious
to
get
safely
home
tera
burst
into
a
jeering
laugh
at
her
manifest
cowardice
then
drove
on
at
full
speed
to
grimleigh
not
until
she
was
safe
on
board
the
schooner
with
jack
beside
her
would
she
feel
secure
the
laws
in
england
were
scarcely
so
lax
as
those
in
koiau
and
she
could
not
presume
on
her
rank
as
a
daughter
in
this
land
of
the
haolis
whites
after
all
tera
had
no
reason
to
jeer
at
rachel
in
a
different
way
she
was
just
as
great
a
coward
she
did
not
fear
death
in
itself
but
she
dreaded
lest
anything
should
part
her
from
jack
on
arriving
at
the
jetty
tera
carried
out
the
programme
which
she
had
explained
to
rachel
the
was
anchored
some
distance
out
stream
so
she
hired
a
boat
and
made
tolai
who
was
a
brawny
polynesian
samson
carry
the
precious
box
of
gold
to
it
then
she
handed
over
the
horse
and
trap
to
a
fisherman
she
knew
and
gave
him
to
take
it
round
to
the
anchor
hotel
whence
a
could
drive
it
back
to
bethdagon
in
making
these
arrangements
tera
displayed
considerable
she
was
quick
in
looking
after
her
own
interests
in
ten
minutes
more
or
less
the
boat
was
alongside
the
and
jack
with
considerable
amazement
looked
over
the
taffrail
hullo
tera
he
cried
anything
wrong
no
all
is
right
jack
get
this
box
on
board
and
take
it
to
your
cabin
at
once
is
captain
jacob
here
she
added
as
jack
helped
her
up
the
side
gone
ashore
do
you
want
to
see
him
i
want
to
see
you
tolai
come
she
said
in
native
then
slipped
again
into
english
take
care
of
the
box
jack
seems
a
heavy
box
what
is
in
it
i
will
tell
you
soon
said
tera
wisely
for
two
or
three
of
the
crew
were
within
earshot
come
to
your
cabin
my
jack
the
box
was
carried
into
the
cabin
by
tolai
tera
closed
the
door
and
looked
round
we
are
safe
here
are
we
not
she
asked
no
one
will
hear
of
course
not
replied
finland
somewhat
surprised
what
on
earth
are
you
driving
at
open
the
box
said
tera
handing
her
lover
the
key
with
an
air
of
triumph
jack
still
puzzled
proceeded
to
do
as
he
was
told
when
the
lid
was
thrown
open
and
the
wrappings
had
been
removed
he
was
amazed
to
see
the
pile
of
golden
sovereigns
gold
money
he
cried
falling
back
a
pace
great
scott
tera
how
did
you
get
this
tera
crowed
like
a
delighted
child
it
is
a
long
long
story
guess
who
gave
it
to
me
my
uncle
no
no
not
your
uncle
cried
the
girl
clapping
her
hands
rachel
rachel
repeated
jack
this
is
her
own
money
then
why
did
she
give
it
to
you
i
said
give
me
five
hundred
pounds
for
my
jack
and
i
will
tell
you
who
killed
zara
rachel
said
yes
to
save
herbert
she
gave
me
the
money
and
i
brought
it
here
now
my
jack
we
can
go
to
my
own
island
where
you
will
be
a
great
chief
hold
on
tera
said
finland
seriously
how
do
you
know
who
killed
this
girl
oh
i
know
i
know
it
was
i
who
killed
her
you
jack
dropped
back
on
a
locker
as
though
he
had
been
shot
and
every
drop
of
blood
ebbed
from
his
face
you
killed
zara
tera
began
to
be
frightened
there
was
a
look
on
jack
face
she
had
never
seen
before
why
do
you
look
so
she
faltered
am
i
a
bad
girl
oh
no
poor
tera
is
good
to
you
she
brings
you
this
money
she
gives
you
her
pearls
there
is
some
devilry
about
this
cried
jack
hoarsely
seizing
her
wrist
i
do
believe
you
killed
the
girl
tell
me
the
story
you
told
rachel
and
how
you
got
this
money
quick
every
word
tera
collapsed
on
to
the
floor
and
began
to
weep
au√©
she
wailed
rocking
herself
to
and
fro
you
are
cruel
to
poor
tera
au√©
tell
me
the
story
i
swear
you
did
not
murder
the
girl
tolai
sit
in
that
corner
he
added
for
the
polynesian
was
much
distressed
by
tera
tears
obey
me
at
once
or
i
sling
you
overboard
now
then
tera
tell
me
the
truth
but
it
was
not
so
easy
to
loosen
tera
tongue
she
was
with
jack
and
of
his
stern
manner
however
by
coaxing
and
threatening
and
commanding
he
managed
to
extract
from
her
the
story
she
had
told
rachel
in
order
to
obtain
the
money
when
he
was
in
full
possession
of
the
facts
he
took
a
turn
round
the
cabin
he
was
in
despair
knowing
that
tera
was
half
a
savage
he
saw
no
reason
to
doubt
the
truth
of
her
statement
she
did
not
regard
murder
with
the
horror
of
a
european
she
did
not
think
it
was
a
particularly
great
sin
in
spite
of
her
christian
training
jack
loved
the
girl
and
wished
to
marry
her
particularly
as
the
marriage
would
place
him
comfortably
and
influentially
in
the
life
he
found
most
congenial
but
it
seemed
that
tera
had
killed
the
unhappy
zara
in
a
most
way
and
with
the
slightest
of
motives
he
did
not
care
to
take
the
murderess
to
his
bosom
in
the
mean
time
tera
sat
on
the
cabin
floor
in
a
sulky
frame
of
mind
privately
she
considered
that
she
had
tricked
rachel
out
of
her
money
in
a
very
clever
way
and
deserved
praise
rather
than
blame
she
could
not
understand
why
her
lover
made
such
a
fuss
over
such
a
small
matter
as
the
murder
of
this
wretched
girl
he
could
have
killed
a
dozen
in
koiau
without
causing
her
the
least
annoyance
so
she
sat
still
weeping
and
sulking
and
very
much
inclined
with
the
pettish
temper
of
a
childish
nature
to
end
the
whole
trouble
by
throwing
herself
overboard
in
spite
of
her
conversion
and
education
poor
wilful
tera
had
yet
to
learn
the
a
b
c
of
civilization
tera
said
jack
at
length
in
a
grave
voice
this
is
a
serious
matter
i
do
see
that
it
is
whimpered
the
girl
you
did
love
zara
no
but
i
did
wish
you
to
kill
her
my
dear
kill
her
tera
looked
up
in
amazement
but
i
did
kill
her
finland
was
so
dumfounded
that
he
could
only
stare
i
did
not
kill
her
repeated
tera
rising
what
makes
you
think
i
did
why
why
you
said
so
of
course
i
did
to
rachel
she
would
not
give
me
the
money
you
wanted
unless
i
told
her
who
killed
zara
i
do
know
who
did
and
i
could
think
of
any
one
else
so
i
said
i
killed
her
tera
jack
arms
were
round
her
and
his
voice
was
shaking
with
the
emotion
caused
by
a
sense
of
relief
then
you
made
up
this
story
to
get
the
money
why
of
course
you
did
think
it
was
true
jack
upon
my
soul
i
did
gasped
jack
not
knowing
whether
to
be
amused
or
angered
oh
lord
tera
what
a
fright
you
have
given
me
you
told
me
the
story
with
so
much
detail
that
i
thought
it
was
all
square
i
never
heard
better
lying
in
my
life
you
are
not
angry
now
jack
well
i
am
a
bit
you
are
a
bad
girl
tera
to
deceive
rachel
so
tera
began
to
whimper
again
i
wanted
to
get
the
money
i
could
get
it
in
no
other
way
i
never
saw
zara
after
we
changed
clothes
and
i
know
no
more
than
you
do
who
killed
her
what
trouble
you
make
over
this
woman
i
would
have
killed
her
myself
had
i
wished
to
but
i
did
not
i
very
glad
you
did
said
jack
emphatically
well
i
must
see
rachel
about
this
and
tell
her
you
were
joking
but
you
wo
give
back
the
money
jack
looked
at
the
box
of
gold
and
felt
very
much
inclined
to
keep
it
after
tera
difficulty
and
perjury
in
getting
it
but
finland
was
an
honest
man
so
he
put
the
temptation
from
him
i
must
tera
said
he
with
a
sigh
you
got
the
money
under
false
pretences
i
ca
take
rachel
little
fortune
au√©
wailed
tera
dismally
she
wants
to
lend
it
to
you
she
told
me
so
indeed
she
did
ah
that
a
different
matter
if
rachel
lends
me
the
money
i
must
see
her
about
it
i
pay
her
back
principal
and
interest
in
a
year
or
two
i
wish
i
had
known
of
her
intention
before
you
put
your
oar
in
lass
i
did
what
i
did
for
you
all
right
do
pipe
your
eye
again
and
jack
patted
her
hand
now
let
us
go
back
to
my
uncle
i
see
rachel
and
square
your
trouble
i
do
want
to
go
back
jack
i
come
to
stay
here
you
ca
do
that
tera
i
will
stay
here
said
tera
doggedly
let
us
marry
and
go
away
jack
scratched
his
head
he
did
not
exactly
know
how
to
deal
with
this
unreasonable
native
he
closed
the
box
and
turned
towards
the
door
at
that
moment
it
opened
to
tera
profound
surprise
she
beheld
pharaoh
lee
chapter
xxii
the
truth
it
was
pharaoh
lee
the
very
man
in
search
of
whom
the
police
were
scouring
the
country
so
astonished
was
tera
at
his
unexpected
appearance
that
she
could
only
stare
at
him
in
silence
his
face
sullen
and
lowering
lighted
up
with
a
fierce
joy
when
he
recognized
her
you
come
from
the
farm
he
said
stepping
up
close
to
her
is
that
gentile
beast
yet
dead
no
stammered
the
girl
finding
her
tongue
he
is
not
going
to
die
duvel
swore
lee
savagely
why
did
i
not
strike
harder
job
for
another
chance
you
will
not
betray
me
no
i
shall
not
say
a
word
said
tera
earnestly
i
was
glad
when
i
saw
you
stab
that
man
he
is
a
low
dog
but
how
did
you
come
here
the
police
look
for
you
everywhere
except
in
the
right
place
said
finland
with
a
grin
no
one
thinks
lee
is
aboard
with
us
he
came
straight
from
bethdagon
to
grimleigh
after
midnight
when
all
was
quiet
he
swam
out
here
and
climbed
on
board
to
see
the
skipper
when
shackel
heard
his
story
he
promised
to
conceal
him
for
my
sake
he
knew
i
had
any
great
love
for
mayne
and
that
i
be
glad
to
give
lee
a
hand
besides
added
jack
with
a
shrug
mayne
is
getting
on
right
enough
there
no
great
harm
been
done
i
kill
him
yet
said
the
gipsy
under
his
breath
ah
you
do
that
at
your
own
risk
matey
tolai
help
me
to
carry
this
box
into
my
cabin
while
the
man
attended
to
this
business
tera
conversed
with
lee
are
you
coming
with
us
to
koiau
she
asked
curiously
no
shackel
is
going
to
land
me
down
the
coast
somewhere
then
i
shall
come
back
and
settle
my
account
with
herbert
mayne
i
see
that
it
settled
next
time
said
pharaoh
between
his
teeth
and
he
looked
as
though
he
meant
it
you
are
a
great
warrior
said
tera
and
patted
his
hand
i
know
mayne
married
zara
and
took
her
from
you
but
i
do
not
think
he
killed
her
it
either
him
or
slade
growled
i
make
sure
which
of
them
strangled
my
poor
pretty
zara
and
if
i
swing
for
it
i
give
him
my
knife
for
all
it
worth
meanwhile
i
safe
enough
here
those
beggarly
police
can
hunt
every
in
the
land
as
lee
said
this
jack
having
locked
up
the
money
returned
to
the
cabin
with
tolai
at
his
heels
come
tera
let
us
go
ashore
with
the
kanaka
if
you
wo
return
to
my
uncle
you
wo
mind
staying
at
your
old
quarters
again
johnson
will
put
you
up
i
afraid
said
tera
drawing
back
if
i
go
there
misi
brand
will
get
me
then
he
will
not
let
me
go
with
you
oh
bosh
said
jack
sharply
if
brand
interferes
i
kick
him
into
kingdom
come
you
all
right
with
the
he
has
promised
to
marry
us
so
he
look
after
you
in
the
mean
time
it
was
not
always
easy
to
make
tera
see
sense
she
was
as
unreasonable
as
a
child
at
present
she
was
filled
with
the
idea
that
brand
might
part
her
from
jack
and
she
thought
herself
safe
only
when
on
board
the
indeed
now
that
the
day
of
her
return
to
koiau
was
drawing
near
she
seemed
to
be
losing
the
little
control
of
herself
she
had
acquired
this
was
particularly
evidenced
by
her
refusal
to
respond
to
her
baptismal
name
of
bithiah
jack
was
by
no
means
but
he
had
a
shrewd
suspicion
that
by
the
time
tera
reached
koiau
her
veneer
of
civilization
would
have
worn
off
and
she
would
relapse
into
the
wholly
savage
state
natural
to
her
however
this
idea
troubled
him
very
little
a
himself
in
many
ways
he
preferred
the
genuine
savage
to
the
article
but
while
he
remained
in
england
and
particularly
in
grimleigh
where
his
rigid
uncle
lived
it
was
necessary
to
observe
certain
of
the
proprieties
of
life
he
decided
that
tera
could
not
possibly
return
to
the
schooner
until
they
were
married
so
after
much
arguing
and
a
show
of
anger
he
induced
her
to
come
ashore
and
again
take
up
her
quarters
with
johnson
tolai
as
tera
shadow
accompanied
them
pharaoh
lee
who
had
once
more
relapsed
into
his
sullen
humour
of
course
remained
on
board
he
had
no
very
high
opinion
of
the
police
but
he
deemed
it
wise
for
the
present
at
all
events
not
to
leave
his
place
of
refuge
as
tera
and
jack
with
tolai
in
close
attendance
walked
up
the
hill
to
the
minister
house
they
came
face
to
face
with
and
slade
the
no
longer
wore
a
uniform
he
was
in
plain
clothes
now
permanently
so
far
as
the
police
force
was
concerned
jack
had
heard
of
his
dismissal
and
stopped
now
to
speak
to
him
well
sonny
said
he
cheerfully
so
you
left
the
force
i
bin
kicked
out
for
doing
my
duty
growled
slade
glowering
at
his
wife
and
it
jemima
doing
with
her
jealousy
she
never
would
behave
you
need
begin
again
jeremiah
whimpered
jemima
wiping
her
eyes
with
the
corner
of
her
shawl
you

at
me
all
day
ai
i
got
cause
to
ai
you
got
me
turned
out
of
the
force
i
got
to
leave
grimleigh
where
are
you
going
asked
tera
to
london
replied
the
there
ai
no
chance
for
a
man
like
me
getting
on
here
i
bent
on
being
a
detective
like
those
fellows
in
novels
ah
there
some
chance
in
london
what
have
you
done
with
the
pearl
mayne
gave
you
demanded
jack
i
kept
it
and
i
going
to
stick
to
it
chard
wanted
me
to
give
it
up
but
i
would
it
mine
fair
and
square
worth
thirty
and
more
pounds
i
sell
it
in
london
for
we
ai
got
money
thanks
to
jemima
slade
said
finland
seriously
before
you
clear
out
tell
me
if
mayne
killed
the
girl
how
should
i
know
sir
i
ai
got
nothing
to
do
with
the
case
now
let
them
as
think
themselves
clever
find
out
i
do
believe
he
did
all
the
same
he
left
zara
when
i
met
him
where
did
you
meet
him
just
above
the
town
he
was
coming
down
to
grimleigh
and
zara
was
running
in
the
poldew
direction
they
did
meet
again
to
my
knowledge
and
as
i
was
on
duty
i
was
between
them
all
the
time
up
yonder
no
finland
whoever
killed
that
girl
it
was
mr
mayne
as
you
saw
zara
in
my
clothes
you
must
have
known
that
i
was
not
dead
said
tera
i
did
miss
and
when
the
time
came
i
have
said
so
i
was
working
to
find
out
who
killed
zara
not
you
till
them
fools
spoiled
my
case
it
was
zara
who
was
dead
i
knew
well
enough
but
as
she
wore
your
clothes
my
theory
was
as
some
one
as
hated
you
killed
her
in
mistake
from
that
cord
i
thought
as
it
was
johnson
but
it
was
then
it
struck
me
as
you
might
have
had
a
hand
in
it
finland
but
you
had
i
should
think
not
said
jack
sharply
why
should
i
harm
zara
did
you
ever
suspect
mayne
no
i
did
if
he
killed
zara
he
a
done
so
when
he
met
her
and
she
was
alive
after
he
gave
the
pearl
to
me
it
was
in
mistake
for
you
miss
as
the
girl
was
killed
as
i
going
away
i
do
mind
saying
as
much
miss
sir
jemima
you
come
along
we
ai
got
no
time
to
lose
here
the
pair
strolled
off
the
woman
still
in
tears
and
jack
continued
his
way
deep
in
thought
if
slade
theory
that
zara
had
been
killed
in
mistake
for
tera
were
correct
mayne
could
not
be
the
guilty
party
he
could
have
absolutely
no
reason
to
murder
the
native
girl
and
if
he
were
innocent
who
was
guilty
finland
was
as
much
in
the
dark
as
ever
he
felt
he
owed
rachel
some
reparation
for
tera
trickery
and
if
before
he
left
for
koiau
he
could
clear
mayne
character
he
would
be
doing
her
service
more
substantial
than
he
was
ever
likely
to
accomplish
in
any
other
direction
he
did
not
like
mayne
he
thought
him
an
scoundrel
but
rachel
had
set
her
heart
on
marrying
and
reforming
him
so
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
let
her
have
her
wish
and
if
possible
to
aid
her
towards
the
consummation
of
it
tera
said
jack
as
they
drew
near
johnson
house
you
must
tell
the
parson
chap
how
you
tricked
rachel
au√©
wept
tera
he
will
be
cross
with
me
i
do
want
to
you
must
insisted
her
lover
we
must
put
our
heads
together
and
find
out
the
truth
somehow
we
must
clear
mayne
after
getting
that
money
out
of
rachel
it
is
the
least
you
can
do
to
make
it
up
to
her
the
girl
clapped
her
hands
you
will
keep
the
money
then
jack
h
that
depends
upon
rachel
i
place
you
in
the
charge
first
then
i
go
and
see
rachel
the
minister
was
absent
for
the
moment
but
he
was
expected
to
return
shortly
johnson
however
received
tera
though
with
no
very
good
grace
she
knew
that
the
girl
had
refused
to
marry
her
son
and
had
involved
him
in
great
trouble
by
her
secret
flight
as
a
mother
and
more
particularly
as
a
woman
she
would
have
refused
admittance
to
the
fugitive
but
she
was
also
a
christian
and
it
was
her
duty
to
forgive
so
it
was
arranged
that
tera
should
occupy
her
old
room
leaving
her
then
in
charge
of
johnson
and
the
ubiquitous
and
tolai
jack
after
promising
to
return
in
a
couple
of
hours
set
out
for
bethdagon
to
see
rachel
his
errand
was
not
a
pleasant
one
but
it
was
necessary
and
right
that
rachel
should
be
undeceived
that
tera
trickery
should
be
made
known
to
her
and
the
money
which
through
it
had
been
forthcoming
restored
rachel
had
returned
home
in
a
state
of
mind
easier
to
imagine
than
to
describe
after
the
graphic
story
narrated
by
tera
she
fully
believed
that
the
girl
giving
rein
to
the
savage
instincts
of
her
nature
had
murdered
zara
to
protect
herself
from
pursuit
she
could
not
decide
what
to
do
for
anxious
as
she
was
to
save
herbert
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
denounce
the
native
girl
after
all
she
was
a
savage
and
did
not
regard
murder
with
any
great
abhorrence
from
her
point
of
view
she
was
less
guilty
than
a
european
would
have
been
rachel
said
nothing
to
herbert
of
the
information
she
had
received
as
value
for
her
five
hundred
pounds
she
did
not
even
mention
the
fact
to
her
father
she
sat
down
alone
to
consider
what
course
she
should
take
before
she
could
decide
her
cousin
arrived
and
informed
her
of
the
trick
which
tera
had
played
upon
her
she
was
naturally
sceptical
but
tera
told
me
the
details
she
insisted
how
she
got
the
cord
from
johnson
study
how
she
met
zara
for
the
second
time
and
how
she
hid
the
body
in
the
field
i
know
rachel
tera
let
herself
go
in
fine
style
i
no
doubt
but
only
to
get
your
money
she
saw
zara
only
once
and
that
was
when
they
changed
dresses
the
rest
of
the
yarn
is
all
her
own
are
you
sure
jack
can
you
trust
her
sure
jack
swore
a
great
oath
i
wish
i
were
as
sure
of
getting
into
heaven
tera
is
a
child
cunning
in
some
things
simple
in
others
she
might
deceive
you
she
could
not
hoodwink
me
no
no
my
lass
tera
is
square
enough
i
would
marry
her
else
you
suppose
i
take
a
mate
with
a
murder
on
her
hands
then
if
this
is
true
how
am
i
to
save
herbert
cried
rachel
in
despair
he
did
not
kill
the
girl
perhaps
not
slade
says
he
did
not
but
mayne
has
done
a
good
many
dirty
things
i
would
marry
him
rachel
if
i
were
you
he
is
a
skunk
if
ever
there
was
one
do
you
dare
to
call
him
names
flashed
out
rachel
the
poor
soul
lies
sick
unto
death
not
lest
you
be
judged
jack
i
love
herbert
and
i
intend
to
marry
him
if
he
is
bad
i
will
reform
him
i
shall
pluck
him
as
a
brand
from
the
burning
this
is
not
the
time
to
give
up
the
man
i
love
when
he
is
in
sore
distress
and
in
need
of
a
helping
hand
what
will
your
father
say
rachel
my
father
unfortunately
is
not
consistent
in
his
christianity
replied
the
girl
in
rather
a
pharisaical
manner
he
thinks
over
much
of
worldly
vanities
of
what
people
say
of
him
and
his
a
woman
shall
leave
father
and
mother
to
follow
after
the
husband
of
her
choice
herbert
is
my
choice
and
in
spite
of
my
father
anger
i
will
marry
him
we
shall
not
stay
here
to
be
mocked
and
despised
herbert
will
sell
his
farm
i
have
some
money
of
my
mother
and
together
we
will
go
to
america
there
we
will
lead
a
new
and
more
devout
life
and
he
shall
atone
for
his
sin
seeing
it
was
futile
her
cousin
ceased
to
argue
with
her
i
only
hope
you
will
not
live
to
repent
it
rachel
said
he
if
mayne
has
a
spark
of
manhood
in
him
he
act
square
by
you
but
about
this
money
you
gave
to
tera
i
could
not
of
course
bring
it
with
me
but
i
have
it
safe
on
board
and
you
shall
have
it
back
no
jack
you
need
not
do
that
i
am
willing
to
lend
you
the
money
if
it
is
to
help
you
on
in
life
repay
it
to
me
when
you
can
that
good
hearing
rachel
said
finland
grasping
her
hand
i
promise
you
shall
have
the
money
and
interest
with
it
in
a
year
or
two
i
not
the
man
to
go
back
on
my
word
i
know
you
are
not
and
i
trust
you
jack
there
is
no
need
for
you
to
give
me
any
paper
or
bond
take
the
money
and
trade
with
it
as
you
say
i
hope
it
will
bring
you
luck
and
that
you
will
prosper
it
is
very
good
of
you
to
do
this
for
me
rachel
i
wish
i
could
do
something
for
you
in
return

out
who
killed
this
poor
girl
jack
and
i
shall
be
amply
repaid
in
some
way
or
another
i

save
herbert
chard
intends
to
arrest
him
as
soon
as
he
is
well
enough
to
be
moved

him
from
that
if
you
can
i
do
my
best
rachel
for
bad
as
herbert
is
well
i
wo
say
a
word
against

guilty
and
i
do
my
best
to
help
you
and

now
i

jack
no

tera
to
go

if
i

anything
to
help
you
and
herbert
i
come
back
and
tell
you
rachel
and
thank
you
for
the
money
jack
god
grant
you
may
be
successful
jack
echoed
the
prayer
as
he
walked
back
to
grimleigh
but
he
had
little
hope
that
it
would
be
answered
he
had
no
experience
in
criminal
cases
and
could
not
see
how
he
was
to
find
out
the
truth
in
this
especial
one
the
matter
of
zara
death
was
surrounded
by
mysteries
and
think
as
he
could
this
simple
sailor
could
not
conjecture
how
they
were
to
be
solved
where
slade
and
chard
both
trained
men
had
failed
he
could
hardly
hope
to
succeed
much
as
he
wished
to
repay
rachel
for
her
kindness
he
saw
no
chance
of
doing
so
in
the
particular
way
she
desired
in
the
way
too
which
would
best
serve
her
and
so
he
was
a
trifle
dejected
when
he
arrived
at
johnson
house
the
minister
had
returned
and
when
he
saw
finland
at
the
gate
stepped
out
of
the
window
to
beckon
him
into
the
study
bithiah
and
tolai
are
at
the
meal
he
said
in
answer
to
jack
inquiries
we
will
join
them
soon
meanwhile
i
wish
to
consult
you
has
tera
told
you
how
she
accused
herself
of
this
murder
yes
johnson
sighed
the
poor
child
is
yet
a
savage
at
heart
i
fear
but
in
her
own
way
she
is
heroic
and
honest
i
do
defend
the
falsehoods
she
told
but
her
action
shows
one
thing
clearly
it
shows
how
well
she
loves
you
oh
tera
a
good
sort
johnson
of
course
you
did
believe
her
guilty
no
i
did
not
i
have
a
very
good
reason
to
disbelieve
it
john
finland
johnson
laid
his
hand
on
the
young
man
arm
it
is
on
this
very
matter
i
wish
to
consult
you
i
know
who
killed
zara
lovell
you
do
this
will
be
good
news
for
rachel
who
korah
brand
chapter
xxiii
trapped
korah
brand
repeated
jack
in
amazement
this
was
the
very
last
name
he
had
expected
to
hear
your
pet
missionary
what
on
earth
do
you
mean
he
killed
zara
i
am
certain
of
it
answered
johnson
positively
though
for
the
present
i
grant
you
i
have
no
proof
now
let
us
see
what
is
best
to
be
done
done
why
tell
the
inspector
of
course
and
get
the
beggar
arrested
no
that
just
what
we
ca
do
just
yet
we
must
have
something
tangible
to
go
upon
and
that
where
i
want
you
to
help
me
sit
down
finland
and
we
will
go
thoroughly
into
this
matter
jack
took
a
seat
and
as
he
looked
inquiringly
at
the
minister
he
could
not
help
being
struck
with
the
marked
improvement
in
johnson
both
in
mind
and
body
the
man
seemed
in
much
more
normal
condition
than
when
he
had
seen
him
last
true
his
face
was
still
thin
but
there
was
more
colour
in
it
and
when
he
spoke
it
was
with
a
degree
of
assurance
that
had
formerly
been
altogether
absent
since
the
suspicions
against
him
had
been
proved
groundless
he
had
been
able
in
a
large
degree
to
resume
his
normal
habits
the
incessant
mental
strain
under
which
he
laboured
then
had
been
removed
and
his
body
had
responded
accordingly
he
spoke
now
with
force
and
decision
his
indignation
against
brand
was
in
every
way
excusable
for
to
him
it
was
that
in
a
large
degree
he
owed
the
terrible
trouble
which
had
come
upon
him
recently
that
indignation
now
spurred
him
on
he
could
perhaps
have
forgiven
the
man
had
he
been
his
open
enemy
but
he
had
struck
at
him
in
the
dark
he
had
plotted
against
him
against
his
very
life
under
the
cloak
of
religion
and
brotherly
love
he
was
a
very
judas
and
as
such
johnson
felt
it
behoved
him
to
unmask
the
man
therefore
was
he
prepared
to
spare
no
pains
to
make
his
suspicions
certainties
he
judged
this
shrewd
young
sailor
would
prove
a
valuable
ally
and
the
result
proved
his
judgment
to
be
correct
i
am
more
than
angered
at
brand
he
said
to
jack
in
a
tone
of
voice
almost
foreign
to
his
usually
gentle
manner
of
speech
perhaps
you
notice
that
i
no
longer
call
him
he
shall
be
cast
from
out
the
congregation
of
bethgamul
for
he
has
done
more
than
break
the
sixth
commandment
but
it
is
of
that
that
he
must
first
be
proved
guilty
well
do
you
expect
that
will
be
very
difficult
it
will
and
it
will
not
finland
to
make
you
understand
what
i
mean
it
will
be
necessary
for
me
to
go
back
to
my
life
in
koiau
you
know
that
i
was
a
missionary
in
that
island
buli
the
high
chief
protected
me
and
i
spread
the
gospel
to
the
best
of
my
poor
ability
now
brand
was
there
also
he
had
been
a
sailor
on
board
a
and
having
been
called
to
grace
he
took
to
mission
work
i
met
him
in
koiau
where
he
was
trying
to
convert
niga
i
remember
niga
buli
brother
was
he
not
yes
buli
brother
and
a
man
of
no
small
importance
buli
i
did
not
succeed
in
converting
but
i
was
successful
both
with
his
wife
viara
and
his
daughter
tera
in
time
i
hoped
to
bring
the
light
to
darkened
soul
for
he
had
leanings
to
our
faith
with
niga
it
was
different
he
was
a
fierce
heathen
and
devoted
to
the
old
idol
worship
i
never
thought
brand
would
succeed
with
him
but
he
protected
brand
for
the
reason
that
the
had
shown
him
how
to
design
and
build
canoes
larger
than
were
commonly
in
use
among
the
natives
when
i
left
koiau
the
population
was
divided
into
two
parts
the
one
half
followed
buli
and
inclined
to
the
teaching
of
the
haolis
whites
the
other
the
heathen
party
held
by
niga
and
would
have
killed
all
the
missionaries
you
understand
yes
was
there
any
fighting
no
buli
was
the
stronger
and
niga
did
not
dare
to
attack
him
now
you
must
know
that
tera
is
buli
only
child
and
he
is
very
fond
of
her
he
intends
that
she
shall
marry
some
big
warrior
and
rule
the
island
after
his
death
he
does
not
trust
niga
who
would
restore
the
old
sacrifices
that
is
bad
for
me
said
jack
thoughtfully
buli
wo
be
pleased
at
my
marrying
tera
on
the
contrary
said
johnson
so
calmly
that
it
was
easily
seen
how
his
unreasonable
passion
for
the
girl
had
passed
away
i
think
buli
will
be
pleased
he
likes
the
white
men
because
they
can
civilize
his
people
if
you
go
to
koiau
with
tera
as
her
husband
buli
will
make
you
his
heir
then
you
can
civilize
the
islanders
and
teach
them
the
blessings
of
christianity
i
not
much
of
a
hand
at
religion
johnson
but
i
do
my
best
i
am
sure
you
will
but
to
resume
niga
knowing
that
buli
intended
tera
for
his
heiress
tried
to
kill
her
but
viara
who
is
clever
and
watchful
managed
to
thwart
him
knowing
the
girl
danger
i
offered
to
bring
her
to
england
with
me
and
have
her
educated
so
that
she
might
be
the
better
able
to
influence
her
people
for
good
both
buli
and
viara
accepted
the
offer
so
i
brought
tera
to
england
away
from
all
danger
but
what
has
all
this
to
do
with
brand
i
am
coming
to
that
said
the
minister
quietly
the
other
day
tolai
came
here
with
a
message
from
viara
from
which
it
appears
that
niga
wishing
to
get
tera
out
of
the
way
before
she
could
return
induced
brand
to
come
to
england
and
kill
her
what
he
was
to
have
for
so
wicked
a
deed
i
do
not
know
the
plot
was
betrayed
to
viara
by
one
of
niga
wives
and
she
at
once
sent
tolai
home
to
tell
me
and
to
protect
tera
also
she
made
tolai
promise
to
be
as
tera
shadow
in
case
brand
tried
to
murder
her
now
you
know
why
tolai
has
been
by
tera
side
all
these
days
the
scoundrel
cried
jack
then
you
think
that
brand
killed
zara
in
mistake
for
tera
i
am
certain
of
it
brand
was
often
in
this
study
and
i
have
no
doubt
he
stole
the
with
the
intention
of
implicating
me
in
the
crime
if
possible
on
seeing
zara
in
tera
dress
he
took
her
for
his
victim
on
strangling
her
and
finding
out
his
mistake
he
no
doubt
dragged
the
body
into
the
corn
what
makes
me
so
indignant
is
that
brand
knowing
i
was
innocent
conspired
with
slade
to
accuse
me
of
the
murder
he
even
tried
to
persuade
me
to
run
away
which
would
have
been
a
tacit
admission
of
guilt
i
am
thankful
added
the
minister
that
tera
was
not
given
over
to
the
charge
of
brand
he
would
have
murdered
her
on
the
way
to
koiau
i
feel
cer
what
is
the
matter
finland
do
swear
i
beg
for
jack
was
on
his
feet
making
use
of
language
not
fit
for
that
respectable
study
the
brute
he
cried
he
was
at
the
skipper
the
other
day
to
get
a
free
passage
to
koiau
shackel
consented
and
i
have
no
doubt
he
intended
to
sling
tera
overboard
when
we
were
well
out
at
sea
where
is
the
skunk
johnson
i
will
wring
his
neck
calm
yourself
finland
you
ca
go
to
him
with
my
story
for
he
will
deny
it
altogether
and
then
we
can
prove
nothing
we
must
trap
him
into
a
confession
i
do
not
like
resorting
to
cunning
but
while
brand
is
free
and
hidden
by
the
mask
of
religion
tera
is
not
safe
now
how
can
we
get
his
story
out
of
him
that
is
not
difficult
said
finland
who
was
as
fertile
in
resources
as
most
sailors
are
let
tolai
go
to
him
and
say
that
he
comes
from
niga
to
know
when
tera
is
to
be
killed
brand
will
believe
this
and
will
talk
freely
now
if
you
and
i
johnson
can
overhear
that
conversation
we
shall
learn
the
truth
that
is
a
good
idea
but
how
are
we
to
overhear
it
where
does
brand
live
was
jack
next
question
not
far
from
here
he
lodges
with
sister
hoppus
of
your
congregation
certainly
said
johnson
stiffly
did
you
not
hear
me
call
her
sister
then
as
you
are
her
pastor
she
will
do
a
lot
for
you
let
tolai
ask
brand
to
see
him
privately
in
his
lodgings
so
that
he
may
give
him
niga
message
in
the
mean
time
you
see
hoppus
and
get
her
to
hide
us
in
the
next
room
to
that
in
which
they
are
then
we
shall
hear
the
whole
business
and
know
how
to
act
johnson
looked
doubtful
i
am
afraid
that
sister
hoppus
will
not
lend
herself
to
such
a
deception
he
said
you
must
try
and
talk
her
over
replied
jack
i
dare
say
it
will
be
difficult
but
i
guess
the
business
is
worth
it
i
want
to
know
the
truth
for
rachel
sake
well
said
johnson
after
some
reflection
your
plan
is
a
good
one
and
we
will
try
it
if
brand
condemns
himself
out
of
his
own
mouth
we
need
ask
for
no
further
proof
and
so
the
matter
was
decided
that
afternoon
the
two
conspirators
took
tera
and
tolai
into
their
confidence
tera
did
not
like
brand
and
quite
believed
in
his
guilt
she
was
more
enraged
than
afraid
on
hearing
of
the
plot
against
her
life
and
insisted
upon
seeing
him
then
and
there
to
taunt
him
with
its
failure
it
was
with
the
utmost
difficulty
that
johnson
kept
her
in
the
house
but
ultimately
she
consented
to
remain
with
jack
while
the
minister
saw
hoppus
during
his
absence
both
tera
and
her
lover
instructed
tolai
in
the
part
he
was
to
play
tolai
was
and
cunning
he
hated
niga
and
niga
tool
korah
brand
therefore
he
was
quite
ready
to
snare
the
man
to
his
own
undoing
both
johnson
and
finland
were
loth
to
resort
to
such
underhand
means
but
considering
the
exigencies
of
the
case
they
considered
no
choice
was
left
them
in
an
hour
johnson
returned
with
the
intelligence
that
he
had
been
successful
in
securing
the
of
sister
hoppus
from
the
account
he
gave
this
had
been
no
very
easy
task
she
has
a
great
opinion
of
the
man
said
he
and
looks
upon
him
as
a
devout
christian
when
i
enlightened
her
she
at
first
refused
to
believe
me
but
i
argued
with
her
and
explained
myself
at
length
i
pointed
out
that
an
innocent
man
was
in
danger
of
his
life
for
sin
ultimately
she
came
round
so
far
as
to
say
that
she
would
hide
us
in
the
room
next
to
brand
parlour
does
she
now
believe
him
guilty
asked
jack
no
she
will
not
believe
until
she
is
convinced
by
his
own
words
so
i
have
arranged
that
she
shall
wait
with
us
and
hear
what
passes
that
is
of
no
use
put
in
tera
misi
brand
will
talk
to
tolai
in
our
own
tongue
so
i
told
sister
hoppus
still
when
we
learn
the
truth
we
can
come
out
and
force
brand
to
confess
it
in
her
presence
she
will
then
be
convinced
brand
is
expected
home
to
his
supper
at
seven
so
we
will
go
to
the
house
at
six
and
hide
in
the
next
room
what
about
tolai
tolai
will
present
himself
at
the
door
somewhere
about
seven
and
ask
to
see
brand
then
he
must
do
his
best
to
make
the
man
confess
i
can
do
that
said
the
polynesian
when
this
order
was
translated
to
him
oh
yes
tolai
is
cunning
he
can
work
in
many
ways
the
truth
shall
be
told
by
misi
himself
shall
we
have
the
police
in
asked
johnson
after
a
pause
no
replied
jack
promptly
you
and
i
understand
polynesian
lingo
but
they
do
first
we
make
sure
that
brand
is
guilty
then
send
hoppus
for
the
police
i
have
the
truth
from
that
scoundrel
if
i
squeeze
his
life
out
to
get
it
he
is
a
strong
man
mr
finland
armed
is
he
who
has
his
quarrel
just
quoted
jack
grimly
look
at
my
arm
sir
i
guess
that
will
level
the
beast
when
the
time
arrived
and
the
conspiracy
became
fact
tera
as
usual
proved
unreasonable
she
wanted
to
overhear
the
conversation
also
and
pouted
and
sulked
because
the
two
men
wished
her
to
remain
behind
let
her
come
said
jack
at
length
three
witnesses
are
better
than
two
and
tera
knows
the
native
lingo
better
than
we
do
she
can
put
us
right
if
we
miss
a
word
so
it
was
decided
that
tera
should
be
an
active
member
in
the
conspiracy
and
after
giving
tolai
his
last
instructions
johnson
had
pointed
out
brand
lodgings
in
the
afternoon
the
three
went
to
hoppus
she
was
a
little
tremulous
old
woman
with
a
grey
cap
and
a
grey
dress
she
seemed
very
nervous
at
the
whole
proceeding
she
showed
them
into
a
clean
empty
bedroom
where
they
had
to
sit
on
the
floor
there
was
a
door
between
this
and
the
but
the
wall
was
only
of
lath
and
plaster
and
thin
and
old
at
that
it
was
certain
that
every
word
would
be
heard
quite
plainly
then
through
the
back
door
we
can
run
round
to
the
front
and
catch
him
said
jack
cheerfully
you
wait
too
wo
you
mrs
hoppus
oh
no
my
dear
gentleman
i
ca
whimpered
the
little
grey
woman
i
must
go
to
the
kitchen
to
see
after
mr
brand
supper
ah
me
perhaps
he
will
not
eat
it
perhaps
not
rejoined
jack
dryly
he
have
precious
little
appetite
i
guess
when
we
done
with
him
you
better
not
take
his
supper
in
hoppus
or
he
smell
a
rat
i
will
send
in
jane
my
servant
she
replied
in
the
dark
jack
touched
johnson
arm
can
you
trust
her
he
whispered
she
wo
split
no
she
right
enough
she
hopes
that
brand
will
vindicate
his
character
you
know
hush
he
may
be
back
at
any
moment
so
the
three
sat
in
the
dark
with
their
ears
against
the
wall
the
minutes
went
slowly
by
and
they
were
growing
tired
of
their
cramped
position
when
the
door
was
heard
to
open
and
brand
entered
the
room
they
recognized
him
by
his
voice
as
he
told
the
servant
to
bring
in
his
supper
jane
who
was
not
in
the
plot
conveyed
her
excuses
for
not
personally
attending
on
her
lodger
she
then
disappeared
returning
shortly
with
the
meal
brand
sat
down
to
it
he
had
hardly
eaten
a
mouthful
when
jane
introduced
tolai
here
a
nigger
sir
as
wants
to
see
you
said
jane
edging
off
from
the
black
man
tolai
said
brand
rising
in
astonishment
tolai
come
to
see
me
io√©
replied
the
man
nodding
you
no
savvy
wot
me
want
tell
you
all
e
same
you
know
niga
misi
niga
jane
you
can
go
said
brand
turning
to
the
girl
as
she
left
the
room
he
rose
and
locked
the
door
now
what
is
it
he
said
to
tolai
in
the
native
tongue
speak
your
own
tongue
tolai
else
the
woman
may
hear
these
walls
are
not
thick
good
replied
tolai
standing
like
a
pupil
before
brand
but
nevertheless
cunningly
getting
as
close
as
possible
to
the
wall
behind
which
the
three
were
hidden
i
no
love
the
white
man
tongue
misi
i
have
looked
for
you
these
many
days
i
come
from
niga
did
niga
send
you
to
me
yes
misi
he
sent
me
to
ask
about
tera
but
you
were
with
her
the
other
day
said
korah
a
trifle
suspiciously
you
declared
then
that
you
came
from
viara
oh
yes
i
know
i
say
so
but
you
do
not
understand
misi
i
am
clever
niga
wants
tera
to
die
so
he
told
me
to
say
i
came
from
viara
then
tera
loves
me
and
wants
me
always
to
be
with
her
some
day
i
kill
her
you
see
does
niga
want
you
to
kill
her
yes
misi
he
does
me
or
you
not
the
least
suspicion
had
brand
that
tolai
was
lying
to
him
still
less
acting
a
part
to
which
six
eager
ears
were
listening
straining
to
catch
every
word
in
the
adjoining
room
he
answered
freely
without
so
much
as
lowering
his
voice
for
he
felt
secure
in
speaking
the
polynesian
tongue
i
suppose
niga
did
send
you
he
said
slowly
or
you
would
hardly
know
as
much
as
you
do
the
girl
is
not
dead
yet
as
you
see
and
if
there
is
to
be
any
killing
i
had
rather
you
did
it
i
had
enough
of
the
business
he
shuddered
slightly
you
are
no
warrior
misi
why
did
you
not
obey
niga
i
did
or
at
least
i
thought
i
did
but
it
turned
out
i
had
made
a
mistake
tera
had
changed
clothes
with
another
girl
i
strangled
that
girl
in
mistake
for
her
ha
ha
you
should
have
been
sure
she
was
the
right
one
misi
you
should
have
watched
for
her
i
did
tolai
i
watched
longer
than
you
would
have
cared
to
watch
answered
brand
with
some
irritation
i
saw
that
tera
was
accustomed
to
take
a
walk
every
evening
in
the
twilight
so
i
determined
to
follow
her
and
strangle
her
i
thought
that
was
the
quietest
way
of
settling
her
i
took
a
cord
a
silk
cord
from
misi
johnson
room
and
one
evening
i
followed
her
but
i
lost
sight
of
her
for
a
while
some
people
were
about
and
i
had
to
take
great
care
not
to
be
seen
when
i
came
up
with
her
as
i
thought
again
she
was
walking
along
crying
i
crept
up
behind
her
and
threw
the
cord
round
her
neck
she
died
very
quietly
but
it
was
only
after
she
was
dead
that
i
discovered
she
was
a
gipsy
girl
and
not
tera
so
i
have
a
murder
on
my
soul
and
that
for
nothing
ahoee
said
tolai
if
you
are
so
afraid
why
did
you
promise
to
kill
tera
why
well
you
poor
savage
would
not
understand
but
niga
promised
me
that
if
tera
died
and
he
became
chief
he
would
compel
all
the
people
of
koiau
to
become
christians
i
sacrificed
the
girl
that
the
gospel
might
be
spread
but
she
is
not
yet
dead
then
you
must
kill
her
on
the
way
back
to
koiau
i
will
not
act
again
no
not
even
to
bring
koiau
into
the
fold
that
dead
face
is
ever
before
me
i
have
sinned
i
have
done
very
wrong
you
have
done
wrong
repeated
tolai
drawing
nearer
then
with
a
lurch
at
brand
throat
he
shouted
yes
and
you
shall
die
for
it
tolai
gasped
brand
and
the
two
men
crashed
on
to
the
table
they
rolled
to
the
floor
brand
fighting
desperately
for
life
hoppus
rushed
in
screaming
and
wringing
her
hands
jack
followed
and
after
him
tera
and
johnson
let
go
tolai
cried
finland
trying
to
wrench
him
away
tera
make
him
leave
go
tera
laid
hold
of
the
native
and
together
she
and
jack
pulled
him
away
in
a
moment
brand
was
on
his
feet
glaring
at
them
brand
said
johnson
solemnly
we
know
all
we
have
heard
all
you
killed
before
he
could
finish
his
sentence
korah
brand
had
seen
the
danger
of
his
position
the
trap
into
which
he
had
fallen
with
a
yell
the
wretched
man
caught
johnson
round
the
body
and
dashed
him
against
tera
and
jack
who
were
holding
tolai
hoppus
fell
on
her
knees
in
terror
quick
as
thought
brand
turned
out
the
lamp
stop
him
stop
shrieked
jack
but
it
was
too
late
struggling
in
the
darkness
they
heard
the
door
dashed
open
and
before
they
could
recover
themselves
brand
had
vanished
into
the
night
but
he
had
left
the
truth
behind
him
chapter
xxiv
nemesis
a
week
later
tera
and
jack
were
married
owing
to
all
that
had
recently
occurred
there
were
few
people
at
the
wedding
rachel
was
still
nursing
herbert
who
was
slowly
but
surely
recovering
his
strength
but
there
was
a
brighter
look
than
had
been
there
of
late
on
the
face
of
farmer
carwell
as
he
gave
away
the
bride
johnson
himself
married
them
his
love
for
tera
and
his
consequent
jealousy
of
jack
had
died
completely
he
closed
the
book
and
told
them
they
were
man
and
wife
without
a
pang
miss
arnott
quite
reconciled
to
tera
followed
as
solitary
bridesmaid
indeed
it
was
she
who
gave
the
bride
the
handsome
wedding
dress
she
wore
a
few
of
the
bethgamul
congregation
were
present
and
looked
on
with
great
delight
at
the
first
convert
of
their
polynesian
mission
becoming
the
wife
of
their
elder
nephew
tolai
was
there
too
and
marvelled
greatly
at
all
he
saw
perhaps
further
to
mark
his
johnson
had
given
the
wedding
feast
and
to
it
came
both
captain
jacob
and
inspector
chard
the
last
declared
a
special
reason
for
his
presence
you
see
i
kept
my
promise
to
dance
at
your
wedding
said
the
big
inspector
as
he
saluted
the
bride
i
have
seen
so
much
of
you
and
your
case
has
been
so
interesting
to
me
that
i
felt
i
must
put
everything
on
one
side
to
be
present
and
i
am
very
pleased
to
see
you
replied
tera
joyously
though
i
fear
you
will
have
no
dance
we
leave
in
the
schooner
this
afternoon
you
are
very
glad
i
suppose
yes
i
am
very
glad
and
so
is
tolai
you
see
we
are
going
to
our
own
land
where
it
is
warm
and
sunny
and
beautiful
far
far
away
from
these
grey
mists
well
i
guess
mists
ai
bad
at
times
struck
in
captain
jacob
who
was
going
over
the
like
a
locust
you
grow
darned
tired
of
a
blazin
sun
and
a
sky
like
a
fiery
furnace
oh
you
there
are
you
captain
said
chard
who
noted
him
for
the
first
time
got
any
more
cyphers
for
me
to
read
guess
i
bested
you
that
trip
sonny
you
did
but
you
wo
best
me
again
in
a
hurry
i
know
that
cypher
now
oh
you
wo
see
me
writin
it
again
matey
i
bound
for
the
islands
and
i
surmise
i
hum
when
the
barky
lifts
the
southern
cross
take
the
ague
out
of
my
bones
anyhow
well
if
you
ask
me
i
think
you
are
best
on
the
other
side
of
the
world
said
the
inspector
dryly
the
law
here
ai
just
the
thing
for
people
of
your
sort
captain
hullo
matey
what
the
jaw
i
mindful
of
your
attempt
to
blackmail
mr
johnson
oh
do
bother
about
that
that
all
square
the
parson
made
it
up
with
me
arter
all
it
was
only
business
i
wanted
that
money
for
our
ship
stores
and
i
had
to
trade
you
may
consider
yourself
lucky
johnson
did
not
prosecute
you
oh
he
would
be
such
a
mean
white
as
that
grinned
the
skipper
winking
his
one
eye
he
a
straight
cuss
he
is
there
ai
much
wrong
with
as
i
can
see
half
annoyed
and
amazed
at
the
old
salt
rascality
the
inspector
turned
away
he
was
promptly
buttonholed
by
carwell
see
here
mr
inspector
have
you
caught
that
blackguard
brand
no
i
have
not
nor
pharaoh
lee
either
for
that
matter
where
the
pair
of
them
have
got
to
beats
me
captain
jacob
chuckled
he
knew
very
well
where
one
of
them
was
but
he
had
no
intention
of
gratifying
mr
inspector
chard
curiosity
to
have
done
that
would
have
been
to
risk
a
lively
storm
with
his
first
mate
and
the
artful
shackel
was
counting
far
too
much
on
influence
at
koiau
to
run
any
risks
of
that
kind
but
carwell
paid
no
attention
to
jacob
chuckle
his
mind
was
busy
with
many
thoughts
and
he
continued
his
conversation
with
the
inspector
it
is
a
great
disgrace
to
bethgamul
he
said
dejectedly
a
very
great
disgrace
we
believed
in
the
man
we
called
him
brother
we
thought
he
was
good
but
he
has
poured
dust
on
our
heads
but
remember
sir
what
your
pastor
overheard
him
say
that
he
wished
to
kill
tera
in
order
that
niga
might
force
his
people
to
become
christians
so
far
he
was
misled
mr
inspector
two
wrongs
do
not
make
a
right
and
it
is
not
the
custom
of
our
congregation
to
spread
the
word
by
means
of
murder
he
killed
zara
in
mistake
for
tera
i
know
but
his
intention
was
to
do
evil
that
good
might
come
of
it
a
very
wrong
intention
well
if
i
catch
him
he
pay
for
his
experiment
you
know
now
that
mayne
not
guilty
of
course
i
do
johnson
and
and
finland
have
made
an
affidavit
setting
out
brand
confession
of
his
crime
and
so
far
as
we
are
concerned
that
document
exonerates
mayne
but
i
wish
we
could
get
the
man
himself
what
of
your
daughter
mr
carwell
she
is
to
marry
mayne
as
soon
as
he
is
well
enough
replied
the
farmer
gloomily
in
the
end
i
had
to
give
my
consent
rachel
would
have
done
without
it
else
however
she
may
yet
bring
the
man
to
grace
there
is
joy
over
the
sinner
that
repenteth
i
hear
mayne
intends
to
sell
his
farm
yes
he
and
rachel
intend
going
to
america
they
will
start
afresh
there
and
you
carwell
do
you
go
with
them
i
am
i
fear
too
old
a
tree
to
be
transplanted
chard
no
when
rachel
goes
a
niece
of
mine
jack
sister
is
coming
to
look
after
my
house
i
shall
miss
my
daughter
more
than
i
can
say
but
i
must
be
content
to
lose
her
we
know
that
a
woman
must
forsake
father
and
mother
to
cling
to
her
husband
i
only
hope
that
herbert
mayne
will
deserve
his
good
fortune
that
i
sure
he
will
said
chard
in
a
tone
of
conviction
he
has
had
a
fright
likely
to
last
him
his
life
i
promise
you
by
this
time
the
breakfast
was
at
an
end
and
tera
attended
by
miss
arnott
went
to
her
room
i
really
sorry
you
are
going
to
leave
us
my
dear
said
miss
arnott
in
what
was
almost
a
penitent
tone
although
once
i
own
i
would
have
been
glad
you
know
why
tera
laughed
and
threw
a
quizzical
glance
at
her
we
quarrelled
over
that
did
we
she
said
i
behaved
very
badly
and
i
hurt
your
ear
did
i
i
am
a
very
wicked
girl
you
are
a
good
girl
now
tera
but
tell
me
how
came
that
of
mine
to
be
found
by
zara
body
i
think
it
caught
in
the
fringe
of
my
shawl
miss
arnott
when
i
changed
dresses
with
zara
of
course
it
passed
to
her
it
must
have
fallen
from
her
dress
when
the
body
was
removed
well
perhaps
that
is
the
explanation
tera
but
the
finding
of
it
very
nearly
got
me
into
trouble
however
we
know
the
truth
now
and
how
wicked
brand
has
been
wicked
indeed
said
tera
i
should
like
you
to
have
heard
him
say
how
tolai
could
kill
me
ah
when
i
return
to
koiau
niga
shall
be
punished
and
misi
brand
too
but
he
is
not
at
koiau
no
not
yet
but
he
has
run
away
from
england
and
i
am
certain
he
intends
going
there
to
stir
up
trouble
against
buli
very
likely
jack
and
i
may
find
him
there
by
the
time
we
arrive
if
we
do
eyes
flashed
and
left
no
doubt
as
to
her
meaning
if
brand
proved
to
be
at
koiau
assuredly
it
did
not
promise
well
for
him
but
a
recollection
that
it
was
her
wedding
day
banished
these
savage
thoughts
from
her
mind
i
am
ready
now
she
said
gaily
ready
for
my
journey
we
must
soon
say
mrs
johnson
tera
miss
arnott
flushed
how
can
you
say
such
a
thing
because
it
will
come
true
very
soon
dear
misi
johnson
no
longer
thinks
of
poor
tera
but
of
you
he
will
make
you
his
wife
miss
arnott
thoughts
went
back
to
the
time
when
she
paid
the
minister
debts
to
certain
glances
he
had
cast
upon
her
of
late
even
to
certain
words
he
had
spoken
perhaps
she
said
with
a
perhaps
who
knows
oh
tera
i
love
him
i
do
love
him
so
when
tera
reappeared
tolai
straightway
shouldered
her
box
and
the
whole
party
walked
down
to
the
jetty
the
heavier
baggage
had
gone
off
earlier
shackel
had
purchased
stores
and
goods
he
had
hired
seamen
and
there
was
nothing
to
do
now
but
to
up
anchor
and
sail
westward
ho
the
bridal
pair
took
leave
of
their
friends
and
stepped
into
the
gig
that
was
waiting
for
them
at
the
jetty
steps
once
on
board
the
shackel
set
to
work
to
weigh
anchor
and
get
away
whilst
the
wind
held
fair
in
consideration
of
his
new
position
jack
decided
to
abandon
his
post
of
first
mate
so
shackel
with
the
second
managed
all
operations
and
the
happy
pair
stood
on
deck
listening
to
the
chanties
of
the
sailors
and
watching
the
group
on
the
pier
head
tera
waved
her
handkerchief
and
smiled
as
the
sailors
tripped
the
anchor
and
roared
their
song
of
outward
bound
in
rude
rhyme
the
skipper
slapped
and
swore
oh
pulling
out
for
rio
he
stay
no
longer
slack
ashore
oh
pulling
out
for
rio
he
said
to
gal
and
boss
and
started
out
for
gain
or
loss
to
lift
the
blooming
southern
cross
pull
out
for
rio
grande
we
off
at
last
said
tera
with
a
happy
laugh
at
last
echoed
jack
and
glad
i
am
to
see
the
tail
of
the
old
country
we
have
just
got
to
drop
pharaoh
lee
ashore
somewhere
down
the
channel
then
let
her
smell
the
open
sea
jack
if
you
put
pharaoh
ashore
he
may
go
back
to
grimleigh
and
kill
mayne
then
what
will
rachel
say
he
could
show
his
face
in
grimleigh
without
being
arrested
replied
jack
encouragingly
and
mayne
is
on
his
guard
oh
you
bet
tera
that
gipsy
had
enough
of
sticking
people
do
let
us
talk
about
him
we
must
talk
of
koiau
said
finland
oh
jack
how
glad
i
am
to
go
back
we
shall
be
so
happy
in
my
land
there
is
bound
to
be
trouble
at
first
tera
we
must
tell
your
father
about
niga
plot
and
straighten
him
out
but
perhaps
viara
has
already
done
that
and
things
may
of
course
be
all
square
when
we
arrive
buli
is
very
powerful
jack
he
will
conquer
niga
and
you
will
help
he
will
proclaim
me
as
the
next
ruler
and
when
we
rule
jack
we
will
make
a
great
nation
of
koiau
oh
we
make
it
a
tidy
place
i
dare
say
come
down
to
the
cabin
tera
and
see
if
the
baggage
is
all
square
the
sails
were
set
by
this
time
and
the
was
heading
to
sea
overhead
the
sky
was
cloudless
and
the
hot
sun
made
the
plain
of
the
sea
glitter
as
with
myriads
of
jewels
as
the
wind
bellied
the
sails
and
the
boat
increased
her
speed
the
foam
swirled
in
creamy
flakes
from
her
sharp
bow
in
her
own
cabin
tera
was
arranging
her
effects
for
the
voyage
suddenly
she
heard
loud
voices
the
scuffle
of
feet
and
then
a
cry
of
surprise
from
jack
she
ran
hurriedly
into
the
saloon
there
between
two
stalwart
sailors
stood
brand
he
was
dusty
dirty
haggard
and
pale
but
his
eyes
were
bright
and
his
face
set
firm
you
scoundrel
cried
jack
fiercely
how
did
you
come
on
board
he
a
blooming
stowaway
sir
spoke
up
one
of
the
sailors
we
found
him
hidden
in
the
hold
before
brand
could
answer
the
skipper
came
down
the
companion
in
a
fury
a
stowaway
aboard
my
boat
he
snapped
out
how
did
well
here
a
party
it
your
brand
yes
replied
brand
looking
from
one
to
another
when
i
ran
away
i
knew
you
put
the
police
on
to
me
so
i
came
back
to
sister
hoppus
she
hid
me
in
her
cottage
and
the
police
never
looked
for
me
there
last
night
as
she
found
out
you
were
leaving
for
koiau
i
got
down
to
the
water
and
swam
out
to
the
boat
where
i
concealed
myself
i
put
you
ashore
cuss
you
growled
shackel
i
ai
going
to
have
no
jonah
this
trip
no
sir
i
am
innocent
i
never
here
shut
your
jaw
said
jack
sharply
we
heard
you
confess
with
your
own
lips
that
you
killed
zara
in
mistake
for
my
wife
your
wife
are
you
married
yes
we
are
married
cried
tera
and
we
go
to
koiau
to
punish
niga
i
go
to
koiau
also
said
brand
resolutely
folding
his
arms
you
ca
put
me
ashore
now
ca
we
growled
shackel
savagely
there
two
words
to
that
my
lad
we
drop
pharaoh
here
down
channel
and
you
go
with
him
a
nice
square
time
you
have
for
he
knows
you
killed
his
gal
and
knife
you
sure
as
a
gun
i
hold
my
own
if
you
wo
take
me
to
koiau
at
least
i
have
a
chance
of
escape
now
i
out
of
grimleigh
how
do
you
know
we
wo
hand
you
over
to
the
police
what
good
will
that
do
retorted
brand
doggedly
you
ca
prove
that
i
killed
the
girl
three
of
us
can
johnson
myself
and
tera
but
i
do
care
if
you
swing
or
not
all
i
wish
for
is
the
truth
here
are
pen
ink
and
paper
so
you
sit
down
and
write
a
confession
i
wo
said
brand
desperately
wo
you
by
gum
roared
the
skipper
then
i
clap
you
in
irons
and
send
you
ashore
at
the
nearest
port
in
charge
of
the
police
the
missionary
looked
round
he
saw
no
gleam
of
mercy
on
the
faces
before
him
he
reflected
that
if
he
was
only
put
ashore
away
from
grimleigh
he
might
contrive
to
escape
it
would
not
be
difficult
to
catch
a
ship
bound
for
america
then
he
could
make
for
and
pick
up
a
schooner
for
koiau
once
on
the
island
and
niga
for
his
own
sake
would
protect
him
i
have
health
and
money
he
reflected
rapidly
it
really
does
not
matter
if
i
confess
as
i
shall
be
far
beyond
reach
when
the
statement
is
placed
in
the
hands
of
the
police
i
shall
come
now
sonny
interrupted
shackel
sharply
what
your
game
oh
i
write
the
confession
you
wish
said
brand
gloomily
but
i
must
state
that
i
killed
zara
in
mistake
for
tera
if
by
her
death
i
could
secure
the
advantage
of
koiau
being
christianized
at
once
i
contend
that
i
was
right
to
remove
her
the
blood
of
martyrs
is
the
seed
of
stop
that
cried
jack
roughly
i
not
going
to
listen
to
any
excuses
for
your
infernal
wickedness
sit
down
and
write
i
tell
you
then
you
shall
go
ashore
with
pharaoh
and
i
hope
he
knife
you
as
you
deserve
you
misunderstand
my
motives
fin
i
understand
one
thing
that
you
are
a
foul
murderer
all
your
religion
wo
get
you
over
that
brand
said
no
more
the
man
was
a
fanatic
and
really
thought
he
was
acting
rightly
when
he
decided
to
kill
tera
her
death
meant
the
conversion
of
koiau
to
the
christian
faith
the
spread
of
the
gospel
the
saving
of
many
souls
but
such
arguments
could
not
avail
with
the
irreligious
lot
around
him
with
a
sigh
brand
sat
down
and
in
half
an
hour
had
written
out
a
full
account
of
how
he
had
murdered
zara
moreover
he
gave
his
reasons
this
document
he
signed
in
the
presence
of
tera
jack
and
shackel
when
mayne
safety
was
thus
secured
finland
turned
on
the
missionary
go
on
deck
you
hound
he
said
leading
him
to
the
door
and
if
you
really
believe
in
the
stuff
you
preach
sling
yourself
overboard
if
i
am
a
sinner
cried
brand
his
eyes
flashing
i
repent
of
many
things
i
repent
of
zara
death
but
if
i
had
killed
tera
i
should
rejoice
i
jack
arm
shot
out
from
his
shoulder
but
before
the
blow
could
get
home
brand
had
scrambled
up
the
stairs
tera
held
back
her
husband
let
me
go
tera
panted
jack
i
want
to
kick
the
beast
leave
him
alone
dear
pharaoh
will
settle
him
there
was
a
loud
cry
on
deck
by
gad
i
believe
pharaoh
is
settling
him
cried
finland
rushing
up
followed
by
tera
it
was
as
he
said
pharaoh
had
come
out
for
a
stroll
on
deck
after
being
confined
below
so
long
when
he
saw
brand
emerge
from
the
cabin
he
first
stared
at
him
in
amazement
then
furiously
launched
himself
at
him
with
a
knife
i
kill
you
i
kill
you
cried
pharaoh
closing
with
the
missionary
you
killed
my
poor
zara
you
shall
die
i
will
not
die
roared
brand
putting
out
his
great
strength
against
the
gipsy
but
he
was
weak
with
fasting
and
pharaoh
unable
to
use
his
knife
tried
to
strangle
him
the
same
death
as
you
gave
zara
he
muttered
while
the
two
men
swayed
and
swung
the
ship
company
mustered
to
look
on
shackel
would
not
let
any
one
interfere
let
kill
one
another
he
said
i
have
no
jonahs
on
this
here
barkey
the
struggle
was
not
of
long
duration
with
a
mighty
effort
pharaoh
lifted
brand
over
the
taffrail
but
the
man
clung
round
his
neck
and
his
superior
weight
dragged
the
gipsy
over
tera
and
jack
and
every
one
on
board
ran
to
the
side
neither
man
would
loose
his
hold
and
together
they
splashed
into
the
water
the
ship
now
well
under
way
sailed
on
once
only
two
heads
were
seen
to
rise
out
of
the
glittering
water
then
murderer
and
avenger
went
down
into
the
deep
sea
never
to
rise
again
zara
was
avenged
and
for
her
pharaoh
had
given
his
life
next
day
jack
and
shackel
went
ashore
at
the
last
port
before
leaving
england
and
made
a
declaration
of
the
deaths
jack
also
delivered
korah
confession
to
the
police
who
promised
to
forward
it
to
inspector
chard
at
grimleigh
then
they
went
aboard
again
and
the
spread
her
white
wings
and
lifted
to
the
swell
of
the
open
sea
her
nose
was
pointed
south
for
the
horn
and
then
koiau
whispered
jack
to
his
wife
koiau
sighed
tera
and
burst
into
wild
singing
in
her
native
tongue
so
they
went
sailing
to
a
future
of
joy
to
the
spicy
islands
set
like
jewels
in
the
shining
seas
of
the
under
