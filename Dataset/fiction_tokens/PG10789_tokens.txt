the
head
of
the
family
letts
had
left
his
ship
by
mutual
arrangement
and
the
whole
of
the
crew
had
mustered
to
see
him
off
and
to
express
their
sense
of
relief
at
his
departure
after
some
years
spent
in
long
voyages
he
had
fancied
a
trip
on
a
coaster
as
a
change
and
the
schooner
curlew
having
no
use
for
a
ship
carpenter
had
shipped
as
cook
he
had
done
his
best
and
the
unpleasant
epithets
that
followed
him
along
the
quay
at
dunchurch
as
he
followed
in
the
wake
of
his
were
the
result
master
and
mate
nodded
in
grim
appreciation
of
the
crew
efforts
illustration
after
some
years
spent
in
long
voyages
he
put
his
chest
up
at
a
seamen
and
by
no
means
perturbed
at
this
sudden
change
in
his
fortunes
sat
on
a
seat
overlooking
the
sea
with
a
cigarette
between
his
lips
forming
plans
for
his
future
his
eyes
closed
and
he
opened
them
with
a
start
to
find
that
a
woman
of
pleasant
but
careworn
appearance
had
taken
the
other
end
of
the
bench
fine
day
said
letts
lighting
another
cigarette
the
woman
assented
and
sat
looking
over
the
sea
ever
done
any
cooking
asked
letts
presently
plenty
was
the
surprised
reply
why
i
just
wanted
to
ask
you
how
long
you
would
boil
a
bit
o
beef
said
letts
only
from
curiosity
i
should
never
ship
as
cook
again
he
narrated
his
experience
of
the
last
few
days
and
finding
the
listener
sympathetic
talked
at
some
length
about
himself
and
his
voyages
also
of
his
plans
for
the
future
i
lost
my
son
at
sea
said
the
woman
with
a
sigh
you
favor
him
rather
letts
face
softened
sorry
he
said
sorry
you
lost
him
i
mean
at
least
i
suppose
he
would
have
been
like
you
said
the
other
but
it
nine
years
ago
now
he
was
just
sixteen
letts
after
a
calculation
nodded
just
my
age
he
said
i
was
last
march
sailed
for
melbourne
said
the
woman
my
only
boy
letts
cleared
his
throat
sympathetically
his
father
died
a
week
after
he
sailed
continued
the
other
and
three
months
afterwards
my
boy
ship
went
down
two
years
ago
like
a
fool
i
married
again
i
do
know
why
i
talking
to
you
like
this
i
suppose
it
is
because
you
remind
me
of
him
you
talk
away
as
much
as
you
like
said
letts
kindly
i
got
nothing
to
do
he
lit
another
cigarette
and
sitting
in
an
attitude
of
attention
listened
to
a
recital
of
domestic
trouble
that
made
him
congratulate
himself
upon
remaining
single
since
i
married
green
i
ca
call
my
soul
my
own
said
the
victim
of
matrimony
as
she
rose
to
depart
if
my
poor
boy
had
lived
things
would
have
been
different
his
father
left
the
house
and
furniture
to
him
and
that
all
my
second
married
me
for
i
sure
that
and
the
bit
o
money
that
was
left
to
me
he
selling
some
of
my
boy
furniture
at
this
very
moment
that
why
i
came
out
i
could
bear
it
he
turn
up
after
all
said
letts
never
say
die
green
shook
her
head
i
said
letts
regarding
her
i
you
do
let
lodgings
for
a
night
or
two
green
shook
her
head
again
it
do
matter
said
the
young
man
only
i
would
sooner
stay
with
you
than
at
a
i
taken
a
fancy
to
you
i
say
it
would
be
a
lark
if
you
did
and
i
went
there
and
your
husband
thought
i
was
your
son
would
it
green
caught
her
breath
and
sitting
down
again
took
his
arm
in
her
trembling
fingers
suppose
she
said
unsteadily
suppose
you
came
round
and
pretended
to
be
my
son
pretended
to
be
my
son
and
stood
up
for
me
letts
stared
at
her
in
amazement
and
then
began
to
laugh
nobody
would
know
continued
the
other
quickly
we
only
came
to
this
place
just
before
he
sailed
and
his
sister
was
only
ten
at
the
time
she
would
remember
letts
said
he
could
think
of
it
and
sat
staring
with
an
air
of
great
determination
at
the
sea
arguments
and
entreaties
left
him
unmoved
and
he
was
just
about
to
express
his
sorrow
for
her
troubles
and
leave
when
she
gave
a
sudden
start
and
put
her
arm
through
his
here
comes
your
sister
she
exclaimed
letts
started
in
his
turn
she
has
seen
me
holding
your
arm
continued
green
in
a
tense
whisper
it
the
only
way
i
can
explain
it
mind
your
name
is
jack
foster
and
hers
is
betty
letts
gazed
at
her
in
consternation
and
then
raising
his
eyes
regarded
with
much
approval
the
girl
who
was
approaching
it
seemed
impossible
that
she
could
be
green
daughter
and
in
the
excitement
of
the
moment
he
nearly
said
so
betty
said
green
in
a
voice
to
which
nervousness
had
imparted
almost
the
correct
note
betty
this
is
your
brother
jack
letts
rose
sheepishly
and
then
to
his
great
amazement
a
pair
of
strong
young
arms
were
flung
round
his
neck
and
a
pair
of
warm
lips
after
but
slight
trouble
found
his
then
and
there
letts
mind
was
made
up
illustration
then
and
there
letts
mind
was
made
up
oh
jack
said
miss
foster
and
began
to
cry
softly
oh
jack
said
green
and
moved
by
thoughts
perhaps
of
what
might
have
been
began
to
cry
too
there
there
said
letts
he
drew
miss
foster
to
the
seat
and
sitting
between
them
sat
with
an
arm
round
each
there
was
nothing
in
sight
but
a
sail
or
two
in
the
far
distance
and
he
allowed
miss
foster
head
to
lie
upon
his
shoulder
undisturbed
an
only
child
and
an
orphan
he
felt
for
the
first
time
the
blessing
of
a
sister
love
why
did
you
come
home
before
murmured
the
girl
letts
started
and
squinted
reproachfully
at
the
top
of
her
hat
then
he
turned
and
looked
at
green
in
search
of
the
required
information
he
was
shipwrecked
said
green
i
was
shipwrecked
repeated
letts
nodding
and
had
after
it
through
being
in
the
water
so
long
and
lost
his
memory
continued
green
it
wonderful
what
water
will
do
salt
water
said
letts
in
confirmation
miss
foster
sighed
and
raising
the
hand
which
was
round
her
waist
bent
her
head
and
kissed
it
letts
colored
and
squeezed
her
convulsively
assisted
by
green
he
became
reminiscent
and
in
a
low
voice
narrated
such
incidents
of
his
career
as
had
escaped
the
assaults
of
the
that
his
head
was
not
permanently
injured
was
proved
by
the
perfect
manner
in
which
he
remembered
incidents
of
his
childhood
narrated
by
his
newly
found
mother
and
sister
he
even
volunteered
one
or
two
himself
which
had
happened
when
the
latter
was
a
year
or
two
old
and
now
said
green
in
a
somewhat
trembling
voice
we
must
go
and
tell
your
letts
responded
but
without
briskness
and
with
such
moral
support
as
an
arm
of
each
could
afford
walked
slowly
back
arrived
at
a
road
of
substantial
cottages
at
the
back
of
the
town
green
gasped
and
coming
to
a
standstill
nodded
at
a
van
that
stood
up
the
road
there
it
is
she
exclaimed
what
demanded
letts
the
furniture
i
told
you
about
said
green
the
furniture
that
your
poor
father
thought
such
a
lot
of
because
it
used
to
belong
to
his
grandfather
he
selling
it
to
simpson
though
i
begged
and
prayed
him
not
to
letts
encouraged
himself
with
a
deep
cough
my
furniture
he
demanded
green
took
courage
yes
she
said
your
father
left
it
to
you
letts
carrying
his
head
very
erect
took
a
firmer
grip
of
their
arms
and
gazed
steadily
at
a
man
who
was
eying
them
in
some
astonishment
from
the
doorway
with
arms
still
linked
they
found
the
narrow
gateway
somewhat
difficult
but
they
negotiated
it
by
a
turning
movement
and
standing
in
the
front
garden
waited
while
green
tried
to
find
her
voice
illustration
a
man
was
eying
them
in
some
astonishment
from
the
doorway
jack
she
said
at
last
this
is
your
stepfather
letts
in
some
difficulty
as
to
the
etiquette
on
such
occasions
released
his
right
arm
and
extended
his
hand
stepfather
he
said
cheerfully
green
drew
back
a
little
and
regarded
him
unfavorably
we
we
thought
you
was
drowned
he
said
at
last
i
was
nearly
said
letts
we
all
thought
so
pursued
green
grudgingly
everybody
thought
so
he
stood
aside
as
a
short
man
with
a
small
bureau
clasped
in
his
arms
and
supported
on
his
knees
emerged
from
the
house
and
staggered
towards
the
gate
letts
reflected
halloa
he
said
suddenly
why
are
you
moving
mother
green
sniffed
sadly
and
shook
her
head
well
said
letts
with
an
admirable
stare
what
that
chap
doing
with
my
furniture
eh
spluttered
green
what
i
say
what
he
doing
with
my
furniture
repeated
letts
sternly
green
waved
his
arm
that
all
right
he
said
conclusively
he
bought
it
your
mother
knows
but
it
ai
all
right
said
letts
here
bring
that
back
and
those
chairs
too
the
dealer
who
had
just
placed
the
bureau
on
the
of
the
van
came
back
wiping
his
brow
with
his
sleeve
wots
the
little
game
he
demanded
letts
left
the
answer
to
green
and
going
to
the
van
took
up
the
bureau
and
walked
back
to
the
house
with
it
green
and
the
dealer
parted
a
little
at
his
approach
and
after
widening
the
parting
with
the
bureau
he
placed
it
in
the
front
room
while
he
went
back
for
the
chairs
he
came
back
with
three
of
them
and
was
not
without
reason
called
a
porcupine
by
the
indignant
dealer
he
was
relieved
to
find
after
simpson
had
taken
his
departure
that
green
was
in
no
mood
for
catechising
him
and
had
evidently
accepted
the
story
of
his
escape
and
return
as
a
particularly
disagreeable
fact
so
disagreeable
that
the
less
he
heard
of
it
the
better
i
hope
you
not
come
home
after
all
these
years
to
make
things
unpleasant
he
remarked
presently
as
they
sat
at
tea
i
could
be
unpleasant
if
i
tried
said
letts
we
been
very
happy
and
comfortable
here
me
and
your
mother
and
sister
continued
green

we
emily
yes
said
his
wife
with
nervous
quickness
and
i
hope
you
be
the
same
said
green
it
my
wish
that
you
should
make
yourself
quite
comfortable
here
till
you
go
to
sea
again
thankee
said
letts
but
i
do
think
i
shall
go
to
sea
any
more
ship
carpenter
is
my
trade
and
i
been
told
more
than
once
that
i
should
do
better
ashore
besides
i
do
want
to
lose
mother
and
betty
again
he
placed
his
arm
round
the
girl
waist
and
drawing
her
head
on
to
his
shoulder
met
with
a
blank
stare
the
troubled
gaze
of
green
i
told
there
wonderful
openings
for
carpenters
in
australia
said
green
trying
to
speak
in
level
tones
wonderful
a
good
carpenter
can
make
a
fortune
there
in
ten
years
so
i
told
letts
with
a
slight
wink
at
green
and
a
reassuring
squeeze
with
his
left
arm
turned
an
attentive
ear
o
course
there
a
difficulty
he
said
slowly
as
green
finished
a
vivid
picture
of
the
joys
of
carpentering
in
australia
difficulty
said
the
other
money
to
start
with
explained
letts
it
no
good
starting
without
money
i
wonder
how
much
this
house
and
furniture
would
fetch
is
it
all
mine
mother
of
it
stammered
green
gazing
in
a
fascinated
fashion
at
the
contorted
visage
of
her
husband
all
except
a
chair
in
the
kitchen
and
three
said
betty
speak
when
you
spoke
to
miss
snarled
her
stepfather
when
we
married
we
mixed
our
furniture
up
together
mixed
it
up
so
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
tell
which
is
which
nobody
could
for
the
matter
o
that
you
could
have
all
the
kitchen
chairs
and
all
the
said
letts
generously
however
i
do
want
to
do
anything
in
a
hurry
and
i
should
dream
of
going
to
australia
without
betty
it
rests
with
her
she
going
to
be
married
said
green
hastily
and
if
she
she
would
turn
her
poor
ailing
mother
out
of
house
and
home
that
certain
of
she
not
that
sort
we
had
a
word
or
two
at
times
me
and
her
but
i
know
a
good
daughter
when
i
see
one
married
echoed
letts
as
his
left
arm
relaxed
its
pressure
who
to
young
fellow
o
the
name
of
henry
widden
replied
green
a
very
steady
young
fellow
a
great
friend
of
mine
oh
said
letts
blankly
i
got
an
idea
which
i
been
keeping
as
a
little
surprise
continued
green
speaking
very
rapidly
of
them
living
here
with
us
and
saving
and
furniture
letts
surveyed
him
with
a
dejected
eye
it
would
be
a
fine
start
for
them
continued
the
benevolent
green
letts
by
a
strong
effort
regained
his
composure
i
must
have
a
look
at
him
first
he
said
briskly
he
might
meet
with
my
approval
eh
said
green
starting
why
if
betty
i
must
think
it
over
interrupted
letts
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
betty
is
only
nineteen
and
as
head
of
the
family
i
do
think
she
can
marry
without
my
consent
i
not
sure
but
i
do
think
so
anyway
if
she
does
i
wo
have
her
husband
here
sitting
in
my
chairs
eating
off
my
tables
sleeping
in
my
beds
wearing
out
my
helping
himself
stow
it
said
miss
foster
calmly
letts
started
and
lost
the
thread
of
his
discourse
i
must
have
a
look
at
him
he
concluded
lamely
he
may
be
all
right
but
then
again
he
might
he
finished
his
tea
almost
in
silence
and
the
meal
over
emphasized
his
position
as
head
of
the
family
by
taking
the
a
piece
of
furniture
sacred
to
green
and
subjecting
that
injured
man
to
a
catechism
which
strained
his
powers
of
endurance
almost
to
point
well
i
make
any
change
at
present
said
letts
when
the
task
was
finished
there
plenty
of
room
here
for
us
all
and
so
long
as
you
and
me
agree
things
can
go
on
as
they
are
morning
i
shall
go
out
and
look
for
a
job
he
found
a
temporary
one
almost
at
once
and
determined
to
make
a
favorable
impression
worked
hard
all
day
he
came
home
tired
and
dirty
and
was
about
to
go
straight
to
the
to
make
his
toilet
when
green
called
him
in
my
friend
widden
he
said
with
a
satisfied
air
as
he
pointed
to
a
slight
fair
young
man
with
a
moustache
letts
shook
hands
fine
day
said
widden
beautiful
said
the
other
i
come
in
and
have
a
talk
about
it
when
i
had
a
me
and
miss
foster
are
going
out
for
a
bit
of
a
stroll
said
widden
quite
right
agreed
letts
much
more
healthy
than
staying
indoors
all
the
evening
if
you
just
wait
while
i
have
a
wash
and
a
bit
something
to
eat
i
come
with
you
with
us
said
widden
after
an
astonished
pause
letts
nodded
you
see
i
do
know
you
yet
he
explained
and
as
head
of
the
family
i
want
to
see
how
you
behave
yourself
properly
speaking
my
consent
ought
to
have
been
asked
before
you
walked
out
with
her
still
as
everybody
thought
i
was
drowned
i
say
no
more
about
it
green
knows
all
about
me
said
widden
rebelliously
it
nothing
to
do
with
him
declared
letts
and
besides
not
what
i
should
call
a
judge
of
character
i
dare
say
you
are
all
right
but
i
going
to
see
for
myself
you
go
on
in
the
ordinary
way
with
your
without
taking
any
notice
of
me
try
and
forget
i
watching
you
be
as
natural
as
you
can
be
and
if
you
do
anything
i
do
like
i
soon
tell
you
of
it
the
bewildered
widden
turned
but
reading
no
hope
of
assistance
in
the
infuriated
eyes
of
green
appealed
in
despair
to
betty
i
do
mind
she
said
why
should
i
widden
could
have
supplied
her
with
many
reasons
but
he
refrained
and
sat
in
sulky
silence
while
letts
got
ready
from
his
point
of
view
the
experiment
was
by
no
means
a
success
his
efforts
to
be
natural
being
met
with
amazed
glances
from
letts
and
disdainful
requests
from
miss
foster
to
go
home
if
he
could
behave
himself
when
he
relapsed
into
moody
silence
letts
cleared
his
throat
and
spoke
there
no
need
to
be
like
a
and
at
the
same
time
there
no
need
to
be
sulky
he
pointed
out
there
a
happy
medium
like
you
i
said
the
frantic
suitor
like
me
said
the
other
gravely
now
you
watch
fall
in
behind
and
watch
he
drew
miss
foster
arm
through
his
and
leaning
towards
her
with
tender
deference
began
a
long
conversation
at
the
end
of
ten
minutes
widden
intimated
that
he
thought
he
had
learned
enough
to
go
on
with
ah
that
only
your
conceit
said
letts
over
his
shoulder
i
was
afraid
you
was
conceited
he
turned
to
miss
foster
again
and
widden
with
a
despairing
gesture
abandoned
himself
to
gloom
he
made
no
further
interruptions
but
at
the
conclusion
of
the
walk
hesitated
so
long
on
the
that
letts
had
to
take
the
initiative
he
said
shaking
hands
come
round
night
and
i
give
you
another
lesson
you
a
slow
learner
that
what
you
are
a
slow
learner
he
gave
widden
a
lesson
on
the
following
evening
but
cautioned
him
sternly
against
imitating
the
display
of
brotherly
fondness
of
which
in
a
secluded
lane
he
had
been
a
observer
when
you
known
her
as
long
as
i
have
nineteen
years
said
letts
as
the
other
protested
things
be
a
bit
different
i
might
not
be
here
for
one
thing
by
exercise
of
great
widden
checked
the
obvious
retort
and
walked
doggedly
in
the
rear
of
miss
foster
then
hardly
able
to
believe
his
ears
he
heard
her
say
something
to
letts
eh
said
that
gentleman
in
amazed
accents
you
fall
behind
said
miss
foster
that
that
not
the
way
to
talk
to
the
head
of
the
family
said
letts
feebly
it
the
way
i
talk
to
him
rejoined
the
girl
it
was
a
position
for
which
letts
was
totally
unprepared
and
the
satisfied
smile
of
widden
as
he
took
the
vacant
place
by
no
means
improved
matters
in
a
state
of
considerable
dismay
letts
dropped
farther
and
farther
behind
until
looking
up
he
saw
miss
foster
attended
by
her
restive
escort
quietly
waiting
for
him
an
odd
look
in
her
eyes
as
they
met
his
gave
him
food
for
thought
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
at
the
end
of
what
letts
was
pleased
to
term
a
month
trial
widden
was
still
unable
to
satisfy
him
as
to
his
fitness
for
the
position
of
in
a
spirit
of
gloom
he
made
suggestions
of
a
mutinous
nature
to
green
but
that
gentleman
who
had
returned
one
day
pale
and
furious
but
tamed
from
an
interview
that
related
to
his
treatment
of
his
wife
held
out
no
hopes
of
assistance
i
wash
my
hands
of
him
he
said
bitterly
you
stick
to
it
all
you
can
do
they
lost
me
last
night
said
the
unfortunate
i
stayed
behind
just
to
take
a
stone
out
of
my
shoe
and
the
earth
seemed
to
swallow
them
up
he
so
strong
that
the
worst
of
it
strong
said
green
widden
nodded
tuesday
evening
he
showed
her
how
he
upset
a
man
once
and
stood
him
on
his
head
he
said
irritably
i
was
what
he
showed
her
with
stick
to
it
counselled
green
again
a
brother
and
sister
are
bound
to
get
tired
of
each
other
before
long
it
nature
widden
sighed
and
obeyed
but
brother
and
sister
showed
no
signs
of
tiring
of
each
other
company
while
they
displayed
unmistakable
signs
of
weariness
with
his
and
three
weeks
later
letts
in
a
few
words
kindly
but
firmly
dismissed
him
i
should
never
give
my
consent
he
said
gravely
so
it
only
wasting
your
time
you
run
off
and
play
widden
ran
off
to
green
but
before
he
could
get
a
word
out
discovered
that
something
unusual
had
happened
green
a
picture
of
distress
sat
at
one
end
of
the
room
with
a
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
green
in
a
condition
compounded
of
joy
and
rage
was
striding
violently
up
and
down
the
room
he
a
fraud
he
shouted
a
fraud
i
had
my
suspicions
for
some
time
and
this
evening
i
got
it
out
of
her
widden
stared
in
amazement
i
got
it
out
of
her
repeated
green
pointing
at
the
trembling
woman
he
no
more
her
son
than
what
you
are
what
said
the
amazed
listener

deceiving
me
said
green
with
a
scowl
but
i
think
she
do
it
again
in
a
hurry
you
stay
here
he
shouted
as
his
wife
rose
to
leave
the
room
i
want
you
to
be
here
when
he
comes
in
green
stayed
and
the
other
two
heedless
of
her
presence
discussed
the
situation
until
the
front
door
was
heard
to
open
and
letts
and
betty
came
into
the
room
with
a
little
cry
the
girl
ran
to
her
mother
what
the
matter
she
cried
she
lost
another
son
said
green
with
a
ferocious
sneer
a
flash
bullying
ugly
chap
of
the
name
o
letts
halloa
said
letts
starting
a
chap
she
picked
up
out
of
the
street
and
tried
to
pass
off
on
me
as
her
son
continued
green
raising
his
voice
she
ai
heard
the
end
of
it
yet
i
can
tell
you
letts
fidgeted
you
leave
her
alone
he
said
mildly
it
true
i
not
her
son
but
it
do
matter
because
i

to
see
a
lawyer
about
her
and
he
told
me
that

house
and
half
the
furniture
belongs
by
law
to
betty
it

nothing
to
do
with

green

take
yourself
off
before
i
put
the
police
on
to
you
take
your
face
off
these
premises
letts
scratching
his
head
looked
vaguely
round
the
room
go
on
vociferated
green
or
will
you
have
the
police
to
put
you
out
letts
cleared
his
throat
and
moved
towards
the
door
you
stick
up
for
your
rights
my
girl
he
said
turning
to
betty
if
he
do
treat
your
mother
well
give
him
back
his
kitchen
chair
and
his
three
and
pack

dangerous
calm

and
fetch
a
policeman
i

letts
hastily

i
only
going
as
far
as

me
i

talking
so
much
that
i
quite
forget
to
tell
you
that
betty
and
me
were
married
yesterday
morning
he
nodded
pleasantly
at
the
stupefied
green
and
turning
to
widden
gave
him
a
friendly
dig
in
the
ribs
with
his
finger
what
mine
is
betty
he
said
in
a
clear
voice
and
what
is
mine
d
understand
he
stepped
over
to
green
and
putting
a
strong
arm
around
her
raised
her
to
her
feet
and
what
mine
is
mother
he
concluded
and
helping
her
across
the
room
placed
her
in
the
best
illustration
what
mine
is
mother
