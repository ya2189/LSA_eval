the
strength
of
the
strong
south
of
the
slot
the
unparalleled
invasion
the
enemy
of
all
the
world
the
dream
of

will
old
paused
in
his
narrative
licked
his
greasy
fingers
and
wiped
them
on
his
naked
sides
where
his
one
piece
of
ragged
bearskin
failed
to
cover
him
crouched
around
him
on
their
hams
were
three
young
men
his
grandsons
and
in
appearance
they
were
much
the
same
skins
of
wild
animals
partly
covered
them
they
were
lean
and
meagre
of
build
and
and
at
the
same
time
with
heavy
arms
and
enormous
hands
there
was
much
hair
on
their
chests
and
shoulders
and
on
the
outsides
of
their
arms
and
legs
their
heads
were
matted
with
uncut
hair
long
locks
of
which
often
strayed
before
their
eyes
beady
and
black
and
glittering
like
the
eyes
of
birds
they
were
narrow
between
the
eyes
and
broad
between
the
cheeks
while
their
lower
jaws
were
projecting
and
massive
it
was
a
night
of
clear
starlight
and
below
them
stretching
away
remotely
lay
range
on
range
of
hills
in
the
distance
the
heavens
were
red
from
the
glow
of
a
volcano
at
their
backs
yawned
the
black
mouth
of
a
cave
out
of
which
from
time
to
time
blew
draughty
gusts
of
wind
immediately
in
front
of
them
blazed
a
fire
at
one
side
partly
devoured
lay
the
carcass
of
a
bear
with
about
it
at
a
respectable
distance
several
large
dogs
shaggy
and
beside
each
man
lay
his
bow
and
arrows
and
a
huge
club
in
the
a
number
of
rude
spears
leaned
against
the
rock
that
was
how
we
moved
from
the
cave
to
the
tree
old
spoke
up
they
laughed
boisterously
like
big
children
at
recollection
of
a
previous
story
his
words
called
up
laughed
too
the
bodkin
of
bone
thrust
midway
through
the
cartilage
of
his
nose
leaping
and
dancing
and
adding
to
his
ferocious
appearance
he
did
not
exactly
say
the
words
recorded
but
he
made
sounds
with
his
mouth
that
meant
the
same
thing
that
is
the
first
i
remember
of
the
sea
valley
went
on
were
a
very
foolish
crowd
we
did
not
know
the
secret
of
strength
for
behold
each
family
lived
by
itself
and
took
care
of
itself
there
were
thirty
families
but
we
got
no
strength
from
one
another
we
were
in
fear
of
each
other
all
the
time
no
one
ever
paid
visits
in
the
top
of
our
tree
we
built
a
grass
house
and
on
the
platform
outside
was
a
pile
of
rocks
which
were
for
the
heads
of
any
that
might
chance
to
try
to
visit
us
also
we
had
our
spears
and
arrows
we
never
walked
under
the
trees
of
the
other
families
either
my
brother
did
once
under
old
tree
and
he
got
his
head
broken
and
that
was
the
end
of
him
was
very
strong
it
was
said
he
could
pull
a
grown
head
right
off
i
never
heard
of
him
doing
it
because
no
man
would
give
him
a
chance
father
one
day
when
father
was
down
on
the
beach
took
after
mother
she
run
fast
for
the
day
before
she
had
got
her
leg
clawed
by
a
bear
when
she
was
up
on
the
mountain
gathering
berries
so
caught
her
and
carried
her
up
into
his
tree
father
never
got
her
back
he
was
afraid
old
made
faces
at
him
father
did
not
mind
was
another
strong
man
he
was
one
of
the
best
fishermen
but
one
day
climbing
after
eggs
he
had
a
fall
from
the
cliff
he
was
never
strong
after
that
he
coughed
a
great
deal
and
his
shoulders
drew
near
to
each
other
so
father
took
wife
when
he
came
around
and
coughed
under
our
tree
father
laughed
at
him
and
threw
rocks
at
him
it
was
our
way
in
those
days
we
did
not
know
how
to
add
strength
together
and
become
a
brother
take
a
wife
demanded
if
he
had
gone
to
live
in
another
tree
by
we
do
not
do
such
things
now
objected
is
because
i
have
taught
your
fathers
thrust
his
hairy
paw
into
the
bear
meat
and
drew
out
a
handful
of
suet
which
he
sucked
with
a
meditative
air
again
he
wiped
his
hands
on
his
naked
sides
and
went
on
i
am
telling
you
happened
in
the
long
ago
before
we
knew
any
must
have
been
fools
not
to
know
better
was
comment
grunting
approval
we
were
but
we
became
bigger
fools
as
you
shall
see
still
we
did
learn
better
and
this
was
the
way
of
it
we
had
not
learned
to
add
our
strength
until
our
strength
was
the
strength
of
all
of
us
but
the
who
lived
across
the
divide
in
the
big
valley
stood
together
hunted
together
fished
together
and
fought
together
one
day
they
came
into
our
valley
each
family
of
us
got
into
its
own
cave
and
tree
there
were
only
ten
but
they
fought
together
and
we
fought
each
family
by
counted
long
and
perplexedly
on
his
fingers
were
sixty
men
of
us
was
what
he
managed
to
say
with
fingers
and
lips
combined
we
were
very
strong
only
we
did
not
know
it
so
we
watched
the
ten
men
attack
tree
he
made
a
good
fight
but
he
had
no
chance
we
looked
on
when
some
of
the
tried
to
climb
the
tree
had
to
show
himself
in
order
to
drop
stones
on
their
heads
whereupon
the
other
who
were
waiting
for
that
very
thing
shot
him
full
of
arrows
and
that
was
the
end
of
the
got
and
his
family
in
his
cave
they
built
a
fire
in
the
mouth
and
smoked
him
out
like
we
smoked
out
the
bear
there
then
they
went
after
up
his
tree
and
while
they
were
killing
him
and
his
grown
son
the
rest
of
us
ran
away
they
caught
some
of
our
women
and
killed
two
old
men
who
could
not
run
fast
and
several
children
the
women
they
carried
away
with
them
to
the
big
valley
that
the
rest
of
us
crept
back
and
somehow
perhaps
because
we
were
in
fear
and
felt
the
need
for
one
another
we
talked
the
thing
over
it
was
our
first
first
real
council
and
in
that
council
we
formed
our
first
tribe
for
we
had
learned
the
lesson
of
the
ten
each
man
had
had
the
strength
of
ten
for
the
ten
had
fought
as
one
man
they
had
added
their
strength
together
but
of
the
thirty
families
and
the
sixty
men
of
us
we
had
had
the
strength
of
but
one
man
for
each
had
fought
alone
was
a
great
talk
we
had
and
it
was
hard
talk
for
we
did
not
have
the
words
then
as
now
with
which
to
talk
the
bug
made
some
of
the
words
long
afterward
and
so
did
others
of
us
make
words
from
time
to
time
but
in
the
end
we
agreed
to
add
our
strength
together
and
to
be
as
one
man
when
the
came
over
the
divide
to
steal
our
women
and
that
was
the
tribe
set
two
men
on
the
divide
one
for
the
day
and
one
for
the
night
to
watch
if
the
came
these
were
the
eyes
of
the
tribe
then
also
day
and
night
there
were
to
be
ten
men
awake
with
their
clubs
and
spears
and
arrows
in
their
hands
ready
to
fight
before
when
a
man
went
after
fish
or
clams
or
he
carried
his
weapons
with
him
and
half
the
time
he
was
getting
food
and
half
the
time
watching
for
fear
some
other
man
would
get
him
now
that
was
all
changed
the
men
went
out
without
their
weapons
and
spent
all
their
time
getting
food
likewise
when
the
women
went
into
the
mountains
after
roots
and
berries
five
of
the
ten
men
went
with
them
to
guard
them
while
all
the
time
day
and
night
the
eyes
of
the
tribe
watched
from
the
top
of
the
divide
troubles
came
as
usual
it
was
about
the
women
men
without
wives
wanted
other
wives
and
there
was
much
fighting
between
men
and
now
and
again
one
got
his
head
smashed
or
a
spear
through
his
body
while
one
of
the
watchers
was
on
top
of
the
divide
another
man
stole
his
wife
and
he
came
down
to
fight
then
the
other
watcher
was
in
fear
that
some
one
would
take
his
wife
and
he
came
down
likewise
also
there
was
trouble
among
the
ten
men
who
carried
always
their
weapons
and
they
fought
five
against
five
till
some
ran
away
down
the
coast
and
the
others
ran
after
them
it
was
that
the
tribe
was
left
without
eyes
or
guards
we
had
not
the
strength
of
sixty
we
had
no
strength
at
all
so
we
held
a
council
and
made
our
first
laws
i
was
but
a
cub
at
the
time
but
i
remember
we
said
that
in
order
to
be
strong
we
must
not
fight
one
another
and
we
made
a
law
that
when
a
man
killed
another
him
would
the
tribe
kill
we
made
another
law
that
whoso
stole
another
wife
him
would
the
tribe
kill
we
said
that
whatever
man
had
too
great
strength
and
by
that
strength
hurt
his
brothers
in
the
tribe
him
would
we
kill
that
his
strength
might
hurt
no
more
for
if
we
let
his
strength
hurt
the
brothers
would
become
afraid
and
the
tribe
would
fall
apart
and
we
would
be
as
weak
as
when
the
first
came
upon
us
and
killed
was
a
strong
man
a
very
strong
man
and
he
knew
not
law
he
knew
only
his
own
strength
and
in
the
fullness
thereof
he
went
forth
and
took
the
wife
of
tried
to
fight
but
clubbed
out
his
brains
yet
had
forgotten
that
all
the
men
of
us
had
added
our
strength
to
keep
the
law
among
us
and
him
we
killed
at
the
foot
of
his
tree
and
hung
his
body
on
a
branch
as
a
warning
that
the
law
was
stronger
than
any
man
for
we
were
the
law
all
of
us
and
no
man
was
greater
than
the
law
there
were
other
troubles
for
know
o
and
and
that
it
is
not
easy
to
make
a
tribe
there
were
many
things
little
things
that
it
was
a
great
trouble
to
call
all
the
men
together
to
have
a
council
about
we
were
having
councils
morning
noon
and
night
and
in
the
middle
of
the
night
we
could
find
little
time
to
go
out
and
get
food
because
of
the
councils
for
there
was
always
some
little
thing
to
be
settled
such
as
naming
two
new
watchers
to
take
the
place
of
the
old
ones
on
the
hill
or
naming
how
much
food
should
fall
to
the
share
of
the
men
who
kept
their
weapons
always
in
their
hands
and
got
no
food
for
themselves
stood
in
need
of
a
chief
man
to
do
these
things
who
would
be
the
voice
of
the
council
and
who
would
account
to
the
council
for
the
things
he
did
so
we
named
the
chief
man
he
was
a
strong
man
too
and
very
cunning
and
when
he
was
angry
he
made
noises
just
like
that
like
a
ten
men
who
guarded
the
tribe
were
set
to
work
making
a
wall
of
stones
across
the
narrow
part
of
the
valley
the
women
and
large
children
helped
as
did
other
men
until
the
wall
was
strong
after
that
all
the
families
came
down
out
of
their
caves
and
trees
and
built
grass
houses
behind
the
shelter
of
the
wall
these
houses
were
large
and
much
better
than
the
caves
and
trees
and
everybody
had
a
better
time
of
it
because
the
men
had
added
their
strength
together
and
become
a
tribe
because
of
the
wall
and
the
guards
and
the
watchers
there
was
more
time
to
hunt
and
fish
and
pick
roots
and
berries
there
was
more
food
and
better
food
and
no
one
went
hungry
and
so
named
because
his
legs
had
been
smashed
when
a
boy
and
who
walked
with
a
got
the
seed
of
the
wild
corn
and
planted
it
in
the
ground
in
the
valley
near
his
house
also
he
tried
planting
fat
roots
and
other
things
he
found
in
the
mountain
valleys
of
the
safety
in
the
sea
valley
which
was
because
of
the
wall
and
the
watchers
and
the
guards
and
because
there
was
food
in
plenty
for
all
without
having
to
fight
for
it
many
families
came
in
from
the
coast
valleys
on
both
sides
and
from
the
high
back
mountains
where
they
had
lived
more
like
wild
animals
than
men
and
it
was
not
long
before
the
sea
valley
filled
up
and
in
it
were
countless
families
but
before
this
happened
the
land
which
had
been
free
to
all
and
belonged
to
all
was
divided
up
began
it
when
he
planted
corn
but
most
of
us
did
not
care
about
the
land
we
thought
the
marking
of
the
boundaries
with
fences
of
stone
was
a
foolishness
we
had
plenty
to
eat
and
what
more
did
we
want
i
remember
that
my
father
and
i
built
stone
fences
for
and
were
given
corn
in
return
only
a
few
got
all
the
land
and
got
most
of
it
also
others
that
had
taken
land
gave
it
to
the
few
that
held
on
being
paid
in
return
with
corn
and
fat
roots
and
and
fishes
which
the
farmers
got
from
the
fishermen
in
exchange
for
corn
and
the
first
thing
we
knew
all
the
land
was
gone
was
about
this
time
that
died
and
his
son
was
made
chief
he
demanded
to
be
made
chief
anyway
because
his
father
had
been
chief
before
him
also
he
looked
upon
himself
as
a
greater
chief
than
his
father
he
was
a
good
chief
at
first
and
worked
hard
so
that
the
council
had
less
and
less
to
do
then
arose
a
new
voice
in
the
sea
valley
it
was
we
had
never
thought
much
of
him
until
he
began
to
talk
with
the
spirits
of
the
dead
later
we
called
him
because
he
ate
and
did
no
work
and
grew
round
and
large
one
day
told
us
that
the
secrets
of
the
dead
were
his
and
that
he
was
the
voice
of
god
he
became
great
friends
with
who
commanded
that
we
should
build
a
grass
house
and
put
taboos
all
around
this
house
and
kept
god
inside
and
more
became
greater
than
the
council
and
when
the
council
grumbled
and
said
it
would
name
a
new
chief
spoke
with
the
voice
of
god
and
said
no
also
and
the
others
who
held
the
land
stood
behind
moreover
the
strongest
man
in
the
council
was
and
him
the
gave
land
to
secretly
along
with
many
bearskins
and
baskets
of
corn
so
said
that
voice
was
truly
the
voice
of
god
and
must
be
obeyed
and
soon
afterward
was
named
the
voice
of
and
did
most
of
his
talking
for
him
there
was
a
little
man
so
thin
in
the
middle
that
he
looked
as
if
he
had
never
had
enough
to
eat
inside
the
mouth
of
the
river
after
the
had
combed
the
strength
of
the
breakers
he
built
a
big
no
man
had
ever
seen
or
dreamed
a
before
he
worked
weeks
on
it
with
his
son
and
his
wife
while
the
rest
of
us
laughed
at
their
labours
but
when
it
was
done
the
first
day
he
caught
more
fish
in
it
than
could
the
whole
tribe
in
a
week
whereat
there
was
great
rejoicing
there
was
only
one
other
place
in
the
river
for
a
but
when
my
father
and
i
and
a
dozen
other
men
started
to
make
a
very
large
trap
the
guards
came
from
the
big
we
had
built
for
and
the
guards
poked
us
with
their
spears
and
told
us
begone
because
was
going
to
build
a
trap
there
himself
on
the
word
of
who
was
the
voice
of
was
much
grumbling
and
my
father
called
a
council
but
when
he
rose
to
speak
him
the
thrust
through
the
throat
with
a
spear
and
he
died
and
and
and
and
all
that
held
land
said
it
was
good
and
said
it
was
the
will
of
god
and
after
that
all
men
were
afraid
to
stand
up
in
the
council
and
there
was
no
more
council
man
began
to
keep
goats
he
had
heard
about
it
as
among
the
and
it
was
not
long
before
he
had
many
flocks
other
men
who
had
no
land
and
no
and
who
else
would
have
gone
hungry
were
glad
to
work
for
caring
for
his
goats
guarding
them
from
wild
dogs
and
tigers
and
driving
them
to
the
feeding
pastures
in
the
mountains
in
return
gave
them
to
eat
and
to
wear
and
sometimes
they
traded
the
for
fish
and
corn
and
fat
roots
was
this
time
that
money
came
to
be
was
the
man
who
first
thought
of
it
and
he
talked
it
over
with
and
you
see
these
three
were
the
ones
that
got
a
share
of
everything
in
the
sea
valley
one
basket
out
of
every
three
of
corn
was
theirs
one
fish
out
of
every
three
one
goat
out
of
every
three
in
return
they
fed
the
guards
and
the
watchers
and
kept
the
rest
for
themselves
sometimes
when
a
big
haul
of
fish
was
made
they
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
all
their
share
so
set
the
women
to
making
money
out
of
round
pieces
with
a
hole
in
each
one
and
all
made
smooth
and
fine
these
were
strung
on
strings
and
the
strings
were
called
money
string
was
of
the
value
of
thirty
fish
or
forty
fish
but
the
women
who
made
a
string
a
day
were
given
two
fish
each
the
fish
came
out
of
the
shares
of
and
which
they
three
did
not
eat
so
all
the
money
belonged
to
them
then
they
told
and
the
other
that
they
would
take
their
share
of
corn
and
roots
in
money
that
they
would
take
their
share
of
fish
in
money
that
they
would
take
their
share
of
goats
and
cheese
in
money
thus
a
man
who
had
nothing
worked
for
one
who
had
and
was
paid
in
money
with
this
money
he
bought
corn
and
fish
and
meat
and
cheese
and
and
all
owners
of
things
paid
and
and
their
share
in
money
and
they
paid
the
guards
and
watchers
in
money
and
the
guards
and
watchers
bought
their
food
with
the
money
and
because
money
was
cheap
made
many
more
men
into
guards
and
because
money
was
cheap
to
make
a
number
of
men
began
to
make
money
out
of
shell
themselves
but
the
guards
stuck
spears
in
them
and
shot
them
full
of
arrows
because
they
were
trying
to
break
up
the
tribe
it
was
bad
to
break
up
the
tribe
for
then
the
would
come
over
the
divide
and
kill
them
all
was
the
voice
of
god
but
he
took
and
made
him
into
a
priest
so
that
he
became
the
voice
of
and
did
most
of
his
talking
for
him
and
both
had
other
men
to
be
servants
to
them
so
also
did
and
and
have
other
men
to
lie
in
the
sun
about
their
grass
houses
and
carry
messages
for
them
and
give
commands
and
more
and
more
were
men
taken
away
from
work
so
that
those
that
were
left
worked
harder
than
ever
before
it
seemed
that
men
desired
to
do
no
work
and
strove
to
seek
out
other
ways
whereby
men
should
work
for
them
found
such
a
way
he
made
the
first
out
of
corn
and
thereafter
he
worked
no
more
for
he
talked
secretly
with
and
and
the
other
masters
and
it
was
agreed
that
he
should
be
the
only
one
to
make
but
did
no
work
himself
men
made
the
brew
for
him
and
he
paid
them
in
money
then
he
sold
the
for
money
and
all
men
bought
and
many
strings
of
money
did
he
give
and
and
all
of
them
and
stood
by
when
he
took
his
second
wife
and
his
third
wife
they
said
was
different
from
other
men
and
second
only
to
god
that
kept
in
his
taboo
house
and
said
so
too
and
wanted
to
know
who
were
they
to
grumble
about
how
many
wives
he
took
had
a
big
canoe
made
and
many
more
men
he
took
from
work
who
did
nothing
and
lay
in
the
sun
save
only
when
went
in
the
canoe
when
they
paddled
for
him
and
he
made
head
man
over
all
the
guards
so
that
became
his
right
arm
and
when
he
did
not
like
a
man
killed
that
man
for
him
and
also
made
another
man
to
be
his
right
arm
and
to
give
commands
and
to
kill
for
him
this
was
the
strange
thing
as
the
days
went
by
we
who
were
left
worked
harder
and
harder
and
yet
did
we
get
less
and
less
to
what
of
the
goats
and
the
corn
and
the
fat
roots
and
the
spoke
up
of
all
this
was
there
not
more
food
to
be
gained
by
work
is
so
agreed
men
on
the
got
more
fish
than
the
whole
tribe
before
there
was
a
but
have
i
not
said
we
were
fools
the
more
food
we
were
able
to
get
the
less
food
did
we
have
to
was
it
not
plain
that
the
many
men
who
did
not
work
ate
it
all
up
demanded
nodded
his
head
sadly
dogs
were
stuffed
with
meat
and
the
men
who
lay
in
the
sun
and
did
no
work
were
rolling
in
fat
and
at
the
same
time
there
were
little
children
crying
themselves
to
sleep
with
hunger
biting
them
with
every
was
spurred
by
the
recital
of
famine
to
tear
out
a
chunk
of
and
broil
it
on
a
stick
over
the
coals
this
he
devoured
with
smacking
lips
while
went
on
we
grumbled
arose
and
with
the
voice
of
god
said
that
god
had
chosen
the
wise
men
to
own
the
land
and
the
goats
and
the
and
the
and
that
without
these
wise
men
we
would
all
be
animals
as
in
the
days
when
we
lived
in
trees
there
arose
one
who
became
a
singer
of
songs
for
the
king
him
they
called
the
bug
because
he
was
small
and
ungainly
of
face
and
limb
and
excelled
not
in
work
or
deed
he
loved
the
fattest
marrow
bones
the
choicest
fish
the
milk
warm
from
the
goats
the
first
corn
that
was
ripe
and
the
snug
place
by
the
fire
and
thus
becoming
singer
of
songs
to
the
king
he
found
a
way
to
do
nothing
and
be
fat
and
when
the
people
grumbled
more
and
more
and
some
threw
stones
at
the
grass
house
the
bug
sang
a
song
of
how
good
it
was
to
be
a
in
his
song
he
told
that
the
were
the
chosen
of
god
and
the
finest
men
god
had
made
he
sang
of
the
as
pigs
and
crows
and
sang
how
fine
and
good
it
was
for
the
to
fight
and
die
doing
work
which
was
the
killing
of
the
words
of
his
song
were
like
fire
in
us
and
we
clamoured
to
be
led
against
the
and
we
forgot
that
we
were
hungry
and
why
we
had
grumbled
and
were
glad
to
be
led
by
over
the
divide
where
we
killed
many
and
were
content
things
were
no
better
in
the
sea
valley
the
only
way
to
get
food
was
to
work
for
or
or
for
there
was
no
land
that
a
man
might
plant
with
corn
for
himself
and
often
there
were
more
men
than
and
the
others
had
work
for
so
these
men
went
hungry
and
so
did
their
wives
and
children
and
their
old
mothers
said
they
could
become
guards
if
they
wanted
to
and
many
of
them
did
and
thereafter
they
did
no
work
except
to
poke
spears
in
the
men
who
did
work
and
who
grumbled
at
feeding
so
many
idlers
when
we
grumbled
ever
the
bug
sang
new
songs
he
said
that
and
and
the
rest
were
strong
men
and
that
that
was
why
they
had
so
much
he
said
that
we
should
be
glad
to
have
strong
men
with
us
else
would
we
perish
of
our
own
worthlessness
and
the
therefore
we
should
be
glad
to
let
such
strong
men
have
all
they
could
lay
hands
on
and
and
and
and
all
the
rest
said
it
was
true
right
said
will
i
too
be
a
strong
and
he
got
himself
corn
and
began
to
make
and
sell
it
for
strings
of
money
and
when
complained
said
that
he
was
himself
a
strong
man
and
that
if
made
any
more
noise
he
would
bash
his
brains
out
for
him
whereat
was
afraid
and
went
and
talked
with
and
and
all
three
went
and
talked
to
and
spoke
to
and
sent
a
runner
with
a
message
to
and
sent
his
guards
who
burned
house
along
with
the
he
had
made
also
they
killed
him
and
all
his
family
and
said
it
was
good
and
the
bug
sang
another
song
about
how
good
it
was
to
observe
the
law
and
what
a
fine
land
the
sea
valley
was
and
how
every
man
who
loved
the
sea
valley
should
go
forth
and
kill
the
bad
and
again
his
song
was
as
fire
to
us
and
we
forgot
to
grumble
was
very
strange
when
caught
too
many
fish
so
that
it
took
a
great
many
to
sell
for
a
little
money
he
threw
many
of
the
fish
back
into
the
sea
so
that
more
money
would
be
paid
for
what
was
left
and
often
let
many
large
fields
lie
idle
so
as
to
get
more
money
for
his
corn
and
the
women
making
so
much
money
out
of
shell
that
much
money
was
needed
to
buy
with
stopped
the
making
of
money
and
the
women
had
no
work
so
they
took
the
places
of
the
men
i
worked
on
the
getting
a
string
of
money
every
five
days
but
my
sister
now
did
my
work
getting
a
string
of
money
for
every
ten
days
the
women
worked
cheaper
and
there
was
less
food
and
said
we
should
become
guards
only
i
could
not
become
a
guard
because
i
was
lame
of
one
leg
and
would
not
have
me
and
there
were
many
like
me
we
were
broken
men
and
only
fit
to
beg
for
work
or
to
take
care
of
the
babies
while
the
women
too
was
made
hungry
by
the
recital
and
broiled
a
piece
of
on
the
coals
why
you
rise
up
all
of
you
and
kill
and
and
and
the
rest
and
get
enough
to
eat
demanded
we
could
not
understand
answered
was
too
much
to
think
about
and
also
there
were
the
guards
sticking
spears
into
us
and
talking
about
god
and
the
bug
singing
new
songs
and
when
any
man
did
think
right
and
said
so
and
the
guards
got
him
and
he
was
tied
out
to
the
rocks
at
low
tide
so
that
the
rising
waters
drowned
him
was
a
strange
money
it
was
like
the
songs
it
seemed
all
right
but
it
and
we
were
slow
to
understand
began
to
gather
the
money
in
he
put
it
in
a
big
pile
in
a
grass
house
with
guards
to
watch
it
day
and
night
and
the
more
money
he
piled
in
the
house
the
dearer
money
became
so
that
a
man
worked
a
longer
time
for
a
string
of
money
than
before
then
too
there
was
always
talk
of
war
with
the
and
and
filled
many
houses
with
corn
and
dried
fish
and
smoked
and
cheese
and
with
the
food
piled
there
in
mountains
the
people
had
not
enough
to
eat
but
what
did
it
matter
whenever
the
people
grumbled
too
loudly
the
bug
sang
a
new
song
and
said
it
was
word
that
we
should
kill
and
led
us
over
the
divide
to
kill
and
be
killed
i
was
not
good
enough
to
be
a
guard
and
lie
fat
in
the
sun
but
when
we
made
war
was
glad
to
take
me
along
and
when
we
had
eaten
all
the
food
stored
in
the
houses
we
stopped
fighting
and
went
back
to
work
to
pile
up
more
were
you
all
crazy
commented
were
we
indeed
all
crazy
agreed
was
strange
all
of
it
there
was
he
said
everything
was
wrong
he
said
it
was
true
that
we
grew
strong
by
adding
our
strength
together
and
he
said
that
when
we
first
formed
the
tribe
it
was
right
that
the
men
whose
strength
hurt
the
tribe
should
be
shorn
of
their
who
bashed
their
heads
and
stole
their
wives
and
now
he
said
the
tribe
was
not
getting
stronger
but
was
getting
weaker
because
there
were
men
with
another
kind
of
strength
that
were
hurting
the
who
had
the
strength
of
the
land
like
who
had
the
strength
of
the
like
who
had
the
strength
of
all
the
like
the
thing
to
do
said
was
to
shear
these
men
of
their
evil
strength
to
make
them
go
to
work
all
of
them
and
to
let
no
man
eat
who
did
not
work
the
bug
sang
another
song
about
men
like
who
wanted
to
go
back
and
live
in
trees
said
no
that
he
did
not
want
to
go
back
but
ahead
that
they
grew
strong
only
as
they
added
their
strength
together
and
that
if
the
would
add
their
strength
to
the
there
would
be
no
more
fighting
and
no
more
watchers
and
no
more
guards
and
that
with
all
men
working
there
would
be
so
much
food
that
each
man
would
have
to
work
not
more
than
two
hours
a
day
the
bug
sang
again
and
he
sang
that
was
lazy
and
he
sang
also
the
of
the
it
was
a
strange
song
and
those
who
listened
were
made
mad
as
from
the
drinking
of
strong
the
song
was
of
a
swarm
of
bees
and
of
a
robber
wasp
who
had
come
in
to
live
with
the
bees
and
who
was
stealing
all
their
honey
the
wasp
was
lazy
and
told
them
there
was
no
need
to
work
also
he
told
them
to
make
friends
with
the
bears
who
were
not
but
only
very
good
friends
and
the
bug
sang
in
crooked
words
so
that
those
who
listened
knew
that
the
swarm
was
the
sea
valley
tribe
that
the
bears
were
the
and
that
the
lazy
wasp
was
and
when
the
bug
sang
that
the
bees
listened
to
the
wasp
till
the
swarm
was
near
to
perishing
the
people
growled
and
snarled
and
when
the
bug
sang
that
at
last
the
good
bees
arose
and
stung
the
wasp
to
death
the
people
picked
up
stones
from
the
ground
and
stoned
to
death
till
there
was
naught
to
be
seen
of
him
but
the
heap
of
stones
they
had
flung
on
top
of
him
and
there
were
many
poor
people
who
worked
long
and
hard
and
had
not
enough
to
eat
that
helped
throw
the
stones
on
after
the
death
of
there
was
but
one
other
man
that
dared
rise
up
and
speak
his
mind
and
that
man
was
is
the
strength
of
the
strong
he
asked
are
the
strong
all
of
us
and
we
are
stronger
than
and
and
and
and
all
the
rest
who
do
nothing
and
eat
much
and
weaken
us
by
the
hurt
of
their
strength
which
is
bad
strength
men
who
are
slaves
are
not
strong
if
the
man
who
first
found
the
virtue
and
use
of
fire
had
used
his
strength
we
would
have
been
his
slaves
as
we
are
the
slaves
of
who
found
the
virtue
and
use
of
the
and
of
the
men
who
found
the
virtue
and
use
of
the
land
and
the
goats
and
the
before
we
lived
in
trees
my
brothers
and
no
man
was
safe
but
we
fight
no
more
with
one
another
we
have
added
our
strength
together
then
let
us
fight
no
more
with
the
let
us
add
our
strength
and
their
strength
together
then
will
we
be
indeed
strong
and
then
we
will
go
out
together
the
and
the
and
we
will
kill
the
tigers
and
the
lions
and
the
wolves
and
the
wild
dogs
and
we
will
pasture
our
goats
on
all
the
and
plant
our
corn
and
fat
roots
in
all
the
high
mountain
valleys
in
that
day
we
will
be
so
strong
that
all
the
wild
animals
will
flee
before
us
and
perish
and
nothing
will
withstand
us
for
the
strength
of
each
man
will
be
the
strength
of
all
men
in
the
said
and
they
killed
him
because
they
said
he
was
a
wild
man
and
wanted
to
go
back
and
live
in
a
tree
it
was
very
strange
whenever
a
man
arose
and
wanted
to
go
forward
all
those
that
stood
still
said
he
went
backward
and
should
be
killed
and
the
poor
people
helped
stone
him
and
were
fools
we
were
all
fools
except
those
who
were
fat
and
did
no
work
the
fools
were
called
wise
and
the
wise
were
stoned
men
who
worked
did
not
get
enough
to
eat
and
the
men
who
did
not
work
ate
too
much
the
tribe
went
on
losing
strength
the
children
were
weak
and
sickly
and
because
we
ate
not
enough
strange
sicknesses
came
among
us
and
we
died
like
flies
and
then
the
came
upon
us
we
had
followed
too
often
over
the
divide
and
killed
them
and
now
they
came
to
repay
in
blood
we
were
too
weak
and
sick
to
man
the
big
wall
and
they
killed
us
all
of
us
except
some
of
the
women
which
they
took
away
with
them
the
bug
and
i
escaped
and
i
hid
in
the
wildest
places
and
became
a
hunter
of
meat
and
went
hungry
no
more
i
stole
a
wife
from
the
and
went
to
live
in
the
caves
of
the
high
mountains
where
they
could
not
find
me
and
we
had
three
sons
and
each
son
stole
a
wife
from
the
and
the
rest
you
know
for
are
you
not
the
sons
of
my
sons
the
bug
queried
became
of
him
went
to
live
with
the
and
to
be
a
singer
of
songs
to
the
king
he
is
an
old
man
now
but
he
sings
the
same
old
songs
and
when
a
man
rises
up
to
go
forward
he
sings
that
that
man
is
walking
backward
to
live
in
a
dipped
into
the
and
sucked
with
toothless
gums
at
a
fist
of
suet
day
he
said
wiping
his
hands
on
his
sides
the
fools
will
be
dead
and
then
all
live
men
will
go
forward
the
strength
of
the
strong
will
be
theirs
and
they
will
add
their
strength
together
so
that
of
all
the
men
in
the
world
not
one
will
fight
with
another
there
will
be
no
guards
nor
watchers
on
the
walls
and
all
the
hunting
animals
will
be
killed
and
as
said
all
the
will
be
pastured
with
goats
and
all
the
high
mountain
valleys
will
be
planted
with
corn
and
fat
roots
and
all
men
will
be
brothers
and
no
man
will
lie
idle
in
the
sun
and
be
fed
by
his
fellows
and
all
that
will
come
to
pass
in
the
time
when
the
fools
are
dead
and
when
there
will
be
no
more
singers
to
stand
still
and
sing
the
of
the
bees
are
not
south
of
the
slot
old
san
francisco
which
is
the
san
francisco
of
only
the
other
day
the
day
before
the
earthquake
was
divided
midway
by
the
slot
the
slot
was
an
iron
crack
that
ran
along
the
centre
of
market
street
and
from
the
slot
arose
the
burr
of
the
ceaseless
endless
cable
that
was
hitched
at
will
to
the
cars
it
dragged
up
and
down
in
truth
there
were
two
slots
but
in
the
quick
grammar
of
the
west
time
was
saved
by
calling
them
and
much
more
that
they
stood
for
north
of
the
slot
were
the
theatres
hotels
and
shopping
district
the
banks
and
the
staid
respectable
business
houses
south
of
the
slot
were
the
factories
slums
laundries
boiler
works
and
the
abodes
of
the
working
class
the
slot
was
the
metaphor
that
expressed
the
class
cleavage
of
society
and
no
man
crossed
this
metaphor
back
and
forth
more
successfully
than
freddie
drummond
he
made
a
practice
of
living
in
both
worlds
and
in
both
worlds
he
lived
signally
well
freddie
drummond
was
a
professor
in
the
sociology
department
of
the
university
of
california
and
it
was
as
a
professor
of
sociology
that
he
first
crossed
over
the
slot
lived
for
six
mouths
in
the
great
and
wrote
unskilled
book
that
was
hailed
everywhere
as
an
able
contribution
to
the
literature
of
progress
and
as
a
splendid
reply
to
the
literature
of
discontent
politically
and
economically
it
was
nothing
if
not
orthodox
presidents
of
great
railway
systems
bought
whole
editions
of
it
to
give
to
their
employees
the
association
alone
distributed
fifty
thousand
copies
of
it
in
a
way
it
was
almost
as
immoral
as
the
and
notorious
to
while
in
its
pernicious
preachment
of
thrift
and
content
it
ran
wiggs
of
the
cabbage
a
close
second
at
first
freddie
drummond
found
it
monstrously
difficult
to
get
along
among
the
working
people
he
was
not
used
to
their
ways
and
they
certainly
were
not
used
to
his
they
were
suspicious
he
had
no
antecedents
he
could
talk
of
no
previous
jobs
his
hands
were
soft
his
extraordinary
politeness
was
ominous
his
first
idea
of
the
rôle
he
would
play
was
that
of
a
free
and
independent
american
who
chose
to
work
with
his
hands
and
no
explanations
given
but
it
do
as
he
quickly
discovered
at
the
beginning
they
accepted
him
very
provisionally
as
a
freak
a
little
later
as
he
began
to
know
his
way
about
better
he
insensibly
drifted
into
the
rôle
that
would
he
was
a
man
who
had
seen
better
days
very
much
better
days
but
who
was
down
on
his
luck
though
to
be
sure
only
temporarily
he
learned
many
things
and
generalized
much
and
often
erroneously
all
of
which
can
be
found
in
the
pages
of
unskilled
he
saved
himself
however
after
the
sane
and
conservative
manner
of
his
kind
by
labelling
his
generalizations
as
one
of
his
first
experiences
was
in
the
great
wilmax
cannery
where
he
was
put
on
making
small
packing
cases
a
box
factory
supplied
the
parts
and
all
freddie
drummond
had
to
do
was
to
fit
the
parts
into
a
form
and
drive
in
the
wire
nails
with
a
light
hammer
it
was
not
skilled
labour
but
it
was
the
ordinary
labourers
in
the
cannery
got
a
dollar
and
a
half
per
day
freddie
drummond
found
the
other
men
on
the
same
job
with
him
jogging
along
and
earning
a
dollar
and
cents
a
day
by
the
third
day
he
was
able
to
earn
the
same
but
he
was
ambitious
he
did
not
care
to
jog
along
and
being
unusually
able
and
fit
on
the
fourth
day
earned
two
dollars
the
next
day
having
keyed
himself
up
to
an
exhausting
he
earned
two
dollars
and
a
half
his
fellow
workers
favoured
him
with
scowls
and
black
looks
and
made
remarks
slangily
witty
and
which
he
did
not
understand
about
sucking
up
to
the
boss
and
and
holding
her
down
when
the
rains
set
in
he
was
astonished
at
their
malingering
on
generalized
about
the
inherent
laziness
of
the
unskilled
labourer
and
proceeded
next
day
to
hammer
out
three
worth
of
boxes
and
that
night
coming
out
of
the
cannery
he
was
interviewed
by
his
fellow
workmen
who
were
very
angry
and
incoherently
slangy
he
failed
to
comprehend
the
motive
behind
their
action
the
action
itself
was
strenuous
when
he
refused
to
ease
down
his
pace
and
bleated
about
freedom
of
contract
independent
americanism
and
the
dignity
of
toil
they
proceeded
to
spoil
his
ability
it
was
a
fierce
battle
for
drummond
was
a
large
man
and
an
athlete
but
the
crowd
finally
jumped
on
his
ribs
walked
on
his
face
and
stamped
on
his
fingers
so
that
it
was
only
after
lying
in
bed
for
a
week
that
he
was
able
to
get
up
and
look
for
another
job
all
of
which
is
duly
narrated
in
that
first
book
of
his
in
the
chapter
entitled
tyranny
of
a
little
later
in
another
department
of
the
wilmax
cannery
lumping
as
a
among
the
women
he
essayed
to
carry
two
boxes
of
fruit
at
a
time
and
was
promptly
reproached
by
the
other
it
was
palpable
malingering
but
he
was
there
he
decided
not
to
change
conditions
but
to
observe
so
he
lumped
one
box
thereafter
and
so
well
did
he
study
the
art
of
shirking
that
he
wrote
a
special
chapter
on
it
with
the
last
several
paragraphs
devoted
to
tentative
generalizations
in
those
six
months
he
worked
at
many
jobs
and
developed
into
a
very
good
imitation
of
a
genuine
worker
he
was
a
natural
linguist
and
he
kept
notebooks
making
a
scientific
study
of
the
slang
or
argot
until
he
could
talk
quite
intelligibly
this
language
also
enabled
him
more
intimately
to
follow
their
mental
processes
and
thereby
to
gather
much
data
for
a
projected
chapter
in
some
future
book
which
he
planned
to
entitle
of
before
he
arose
to
the
surface
from
that
first
plunge
into
the
underworld
he
discovered
that
he
was
a
good
actor
and
demonstrated
the
plasticity
of
his
nature
he
was
himself
astonished
at
his
own
fluidity
once
having
mastered
the
language
and
conquered
numerous
fastidious
qualms
he
found
that
he
could
flow
into
any
nook
of
life
and
fit
it
so
snugly
as
to
feel
comfortably
at
home
as
he
said
in
the
preface
to
his
second
book
he
endeavoured
really
to
know
the
working
people
and
the
only
possible
way
to
achieve
this
was
to
work
beside
them
eat
their
food
sleep
in
their
beds
be
amused
with
their
amusements
think
their
thoughts
and
feel
their
feeling
he
was
not
a
deep
thinker
he
had
no
faith
in
new
theories
all
his
norms
and
criteria
were
conventional
his
thesis
on
the
french
revolution
was
noteworthy
in
college
annals
not
merely
for
its
painstaking
and
voluminous
accuracy
but
for
the
fact
that
it
was
the
dryest
deadest
most
formal
and
most
orthodox
screed
ever
written
on
the
subject
he
was
a
very
reserved
man
and
his
natural
inhibition
was
large
in
quantity
and
in
quality
he
had
but
few
friends
he
was
too
undemonstrative
too
frigid
he
had
no
vices
nor
had
any
one
ever
discovered
any
temptations
tobacco
he
detested
beer
he
abhorred
and
he
was
never
known
to
drink
anything
stronger
than
an
occasional
light
wine
at
dinner
when
a
freshman
he
had
been
baptized
by
his
fellows
as
a
member
of
the
faculty
he
was
known
as
he
had
but
one
grief
and
that
was
he
had
earned
it
when
he
played
in
the
eleven
and
his
formal
soul
had
never
succeeded
in
living
it
down
he
would
ever
be
except
officially
and
through
nightmare
vistas
he
looked
into
a
future
when
his
world
would
speak
of
him
as
for
he
was
very
young
to
be
a
doctor
of
sociology
only
and
he
looked
younger
in
appearance
and
atmosphere
he
was
a
strapping
big
college
man
and
clean
and
simple
and
wholesome
with
a
known
record
of
being
a
splendid
athlete
and
an
implied
vast
possession
of
cold
culture
of
the
inhibited
sort
he
never
talked
shop
out
of
class
and
committee
rooms
except
later
on
when
his
books
showered
him
with
distasteful
public
notice
and
he
yielded
to
the
extent
of
reading
occasional
papers
before
certain
literary
and
economic
societies
he
did
everything
right
and
in
dress
and
comportment
was
inevitably
correct
not
that
he
was
a
dandy
far
from
it
he
was
a
college
man
in
dress
and
carriage
as
like
as
a
pea
to
the
type
that
of
late
years
is
being
so
generously
turned
out
of
our
institutions
of
higher
learning
his
handshake
was
satisfyingly
strong
and
stiff
his
blue
eyes
were
coldly
blue
and
convincingly
sincere
his
voice
firm
and
masculine
clean
and
crisp
of
enunciation
was
pleasant
to
the
ear
the
one
drawback
to
freddie
drummond
was
his
inhibition
he
never
unbent
in
his
football
days
the
higher
the
tension
of
the
game
the
cooler
he
grew
he
was
noted
as
a
boxer
but
he
was
regarded
as
an
automaton
with
the
inhuman
precision
of
a
machine
judging
distance
and
timing
blows
guarding
blocking
and
stalling
he
was
rarely
punished
himself
while
he
rarely
punished
an
opponent
he
was
too
clever
and
too
controlled
to
permit
himself
to
put
a
pound
more
weight
into
a
punch
than
he
intended
with
him
it
was
a
matter
of
exercise
it
kept
him
fit
as
time
went
by
freddie
drummond
found
himself
more
frequently
crossing
the
slot
and
losing
himself
in
south
of
market
his
summer
and
winter
holidays
were
spent
there
and
whether
it
was
a
week
or
a
he
found
the
time
spent
there
to
be
valuable
and
enjoyable
and
there
was
so
much
material
to
be
gathered
his
third
book
and
became
a
in
the
american
universities
and
almost
before
he
knew
it
he
was
at
work
on
a
fourth
one
fallacy
of
the
somewhere
in
his
there
was
a
strange
twist
or
quirk
perhaps
it
was
a
recoil
from
his
environment
and
training
or
from
the
tempered
seed
of
his
ancestors
who
had
been
generation
preceding
generation
but
at
any
rate
he
found
enjoyment
in
being
down
in
the
world
in
his
own
world
he
was
but
down
below
he
was
bill
totts
who
could
drink
and
smoke
and
slang
and
fight
and
be
an
favourite
everybody
liked
bill
and
more
than
one
working
girl
made
love
to
him
at
first
he
had
been
merely
a
good
actor
but
as
time
went
on
simulation
became
second
nature
he
no
longer
played
a
part
and
he
loved
sausages
sausages
and
bacon
than
which
in
his
own
proper
sphere
there
was
nothing
more
loathsome
in
the
way
of
food
from
doing
the
thing
for
the
sake
he
came
to
doing
the
thing
for
the
sake
he
found
himself
regretting
as
the
time
drew
near
for
him
to
go
back
to
his
and
his
inhibition
and
he
often
found
himself
waiting
with
anticipation
for
the
dreamy
time
to
pass
when
he
could
cross
the
slot
and
cut
loose
and
play
the
devil
he
was
not
wicked
but
as
bill
totts
he
did
a
myriad
things
that
freddie
drummond
would
never
have
been
permitted
to
do
moreover
freddie
drummond
never
would
have
wanted
to
do
them
that
was
the
strangest
part
of
his
discovery
freddie
drummond
and
bill
totts
were
two
totally
different
creatures
the
desires
and
tastes
and
impulses
of
each
ran
counter
to
the
bill
totts
could
shirk
at
a
job
with
clear
conscience
while
freddie
drummond
condemned
shirking
as
vicious
criminal
and
and
devoted
whole
chapters
to
condemnation
of
the
vice
freddie
drummond
did
not
care
for
dancing
but
bill
totts
never
missed
the
nights
at
the
various
dancing
clubs
such
as
the
magnolia
the
western
star
and
the
elite
while
he
won
a
massive
silver
cup
standing
thirty
inches
high
for
being
the
character
at
the
butchers
and
meat
annual
grand
masked
ball
and
bill
totts
liked
the
girls
and
the
girls
liked
him
while
freddie
drummond
enjoyed
playing
the
ascetic
in
this
particular
was
open
in
his
opposition
to
equal
suffrage
and
cynically
bitter
in
his
secret
condemnation
of
coeducation
freddie
drummond
changed
his
manners
with
his
dress
and
without
effort
when
he
entered
the
obscure
little
room
used
for
his
transformation
scenes
he
carried
himself
just
a
bit
too
stiffly
he
was
too
erect
his
shoulders
were
an
inch
too
far
back
while
his
face
was
grave
almost
harsh
and
practically
expressionless
but
when
he
emerged
in
bill
clothes
he
was
another
creature
bill
totts
did
not
slouch
but
somehow
his
whole
form
limbered
up
and
became
graceful
the
very
sound
of
the
voice
was
changed
and
the
laugh
was
loud
and
hearty
while
loose
speech
and
an
occasional
oath
were
as
a
matter
of
course
on
his
lips
also
bill
totts
was
a
trifle
inclined
to
late
hours
and
at
times
in
saloons
to
be
bellicose
with
other
workmen
then
too
at
sunday
picnics
or
when
coming
home
from
the
show
either
arm
betrayed
a
practised
familiarity
in
stealing
around
waists
while
he
displayed
a
wit
keen
and
delightful
in
the
flirtatious
badinage
that
was
expected
of
a
good
fellow
in
his
class
so
thoroughly
was
bill
totts
himself
so
thoroughly
a
workman
a
genuine
denizen
of
south
of
the
slot
that
he
was
as
as
the
average
of
his
kind
and
his
hatred
for
a
scab
even
exceeded
that
of
the
average
loyal
union
man
during
the
water
front
strike
freddie
drummond
was
somehow
able
to
stand
apart
from
the
unique
combination
and
coldly
critical
watch
bill
totts
hilariously
slug
scab
longshoremen
for
bill
totts
was
a
member
of
the
longshoremen
union
and
had
a
right
to
be
indignant
with
the
usurpers
of
his
job
bill
totts
was
so
very
big
and
so
very
able
that
it
was
bill
to
the
front
when
trouble
was
brewing
from
acting
outraged
feelings
freddie
drummond
in
the
rôle
of
his
other
self
came
to
experience
genuine
outrage
and
it
was
only
when
he
returned
to
the
classic
atmosphere
of
the
university
that
he
was
able
sanely
and
conservatively
to
generalize
upon
his
underworld
experiences
and
put
them
down
on
paper
as
a
trained
sociologist
should
that
bill
totts
lacked
the
perspective
to
raise
him
above
freddie
drummond
clearly
saw
but
bill
totts
could
not
see
it
when
he
saw
a
scab
taking
his
job
away
he
saw
red
at
the
same
time
and
little
else
did
he
see
it
was
freddie
drummond
irreproachably
clothed
and
comported
seated
at
his
study
desk
or
facing
his
class
in
who
saw
bill
totts
and
all
around
bill
totts
and
all
around
the
whole
scab
and
problem
and
its
relation
to
the
economic
welfare
of
the
united
states
in
the
struggle
for
the
world
market
bill
totts
really
able
to
see
beyond
the
next
meal
and
the
the
following
night
at
the
gaiety
athletic
club
it
was
while
gathering
material
for
and
that
freddie
received
his
first
warning
of
the
danger
he
was
in
he
was
too
successful
at
living
in
both
worlds
this
strange
dualism
he
had
developed
was
after
all
very
unstable
and
as
he
sat
in
his
study
and
meditated
he
saw
that
it
could
not
endure
it
was
really
a
transition
stage
and
if
he
persisted
he
saw
that
he
would
inevitably
have
to
drop
one
world
or
the
other
he
could
not
continue
in
both
and
as
he
looked
at
the
row
of
volumes
that
graced
the
upper
shelf
of
his
revolving
his
volumes
beginning
with
his
thesis
and
ending
with
and
he
decided
that
that
was
the
world
he
would
hold
to
and
stick
by
bill
totts
had
served
his
purpose
but
he
had
become
a
too
dangerous
accomplice
bill
totts
would
have
to
cease
freddie
fright
was
due
to
mary
condon
president
of
the
international
glove
union
no
he
had
seen
her
first
from
the
gallery
at
the
annual
convention
of
the
northwest
federation
of
labour
and
he
had
seen
her
through
bill
eyes
and
that
individual
had
been
most
favourably
impressed
by
her
she
was
not
freddie
sort
at
all
what
if
she
were
a
woman
graceful
and
sinewy
as
a
panther
with
amazing
black
eyes
that
could
fill
with
fire
or
as
the
mood
might
dictate
he
detested
women
with
a
too
exuberant
vitality
and
a
lack
of
well
of
inhibition
freddie
drummond
accepted
the
doctrine
of
evolution
because
it
was
quite
universally
accepted
by
college
men
and
he
flatly
believed
that
man
had
climbed
up
the
ladder
of
life
out
of
the
weltering
muck
and
mess
of
lower
and
monstrous
organic
things
but
he
was
a
trifle
ashamed
of
this
genealogy
and
preferred
not
to
think
of
it
wherefore
probably
he
practised
his
iron
inhibition
and
preached
it
to
others
and
preferred
women
of
his
own
type
who
could
shake
free
of
this
bestial
and
regrettable
ancestral
line
and
by
discipline
and
control
emphasize
the
wideness
of
the
gulf
that
separated
them
from
what
their
dim
forbears
had
been
bill
totts
had
none
of
these
considerations
he
had
liked
mary
condon
from
the
moment
his
eyes
first
rested
on
her
in
the
convention
hall
and
he
had
made
it
a
point
then
and
there
to
find
out
who
she
was
the
next
time
he
met
her
and
quite
by
accident
was
when
he
was
driving
an
express
waggon
for
pat
morrissey
it
was
in
a
in
mission
street
where
he
had
been
called
to
take
a
trunk
into
storage
the
daughter
had
called
him
and
led
him
to
the
little
bedroom
the
occupant
of
which
a
had
just
been
removed
to
hospital
but
bill
did
not
know
this
he
stooped
the
trunk
which
was
a
large
one
got
it
on
his
shoulder
and
struggled
to
his
feet
with
his
back
toward
the
open
door
at
that
moment
he
heard
a
voice
to
the
union
was
the
question
asked
it
to
you
he
retorted
along
now
git
outa
my
way
i
wanta
turn
the
next
he
know
big
as
he
was
he
was
whirled
half
around
and
sent
reeling
backward
the
trunk
overbalancing
him
till
he
fetched
up
with
a
crash
against
the
wall
he
started
to
swear
but
at
the
same
instant
found
himself
looking
into
mary
flashing
angry
eyes
course
i
to
the
union
he
said
was
only
your
card
she
demanded
in
businesslike
tones
my
pocket
but
i
git
it
out
now
this
too
damn
heavy
come
on
down
to
the
waggon
show
it
to
that
trunk
down
was
the
command
for
i
got
a
card
it
down
all
no
going
to
handle
that
trunk
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
you
big
coward
scabbing
on
honest
men
why
you
join
the
union
and
be
a
man
mary
colour
had
left
her
face
and
it
was
apparent
that
she
was
in
a
rage
think
of
a
big
man
like
you
turning
traitor
to
his
class
i
suppose
aching
to
join
the
militia
for
a
chance
to
shoot
down
union
drivers
the
next
strike
you
may
belong
to
the
militia
already
for
that
matter
the
on
now
too
much
bill
dropped
the
trunk
to
the
floor
with
a
bang
straightened
up
and
thrust
his
hand
into
his
inside
coat
pocket
told
you
i
was
only
there
look
at
it
was
a
union
card
properly
enough
right
take
it
along
mary
condon
said
the
next
time
her
face
relaxed
as
she
noticed
the
ease
with
which
he
got
the
big
trunk
to
his
shoulder
and
her
eyes
glowed
as
they
glanced
over
the
graceful
massiveness
of
the
man
but
bill
did
not
see
that
he
was
too
busy
with
the
trunk
the
next
time
he
saw
mary
condon
was
during
the
laundry
strike
the
laundry
workers
but
recently
organized
were
green
at
the
business
and
had
petitioned
mary
condon
to
engineer
the
strike
freddie
drummond
had
had
an
inkling
of
what
was
coming
and
had
sent
bill
totts
to
join
the
union
and
investigate
job
was
in
the
and
the
men
had
been
called
out
first
that
morning
in
order
to
stiffen
the
courage
of
the
girls
and
bill
chanced
to
be
near
the
door
to
the
when
mary
condon
started
to
enter
the
superintendent
who
was
both
large
and
stout
barred
her
way
he
going
to
have
his
girls
called
out
and
teach
her
a
lesson
to
mind
her
own
business
and
as
mary
tried
to
squeeze
past
him
he
thrust
her
back
with
a
fat
hand
on
her
shoulder
she
glanced
around
and
saw
bill
you
totts
she
called
a
hand
i
want
to
get
bill
experienced
a
startle
of
warm
surprise
she
had
remembered
his
name
from
his
union
card
the
next
moment
the
superintendent
had
been
plucked
from
the
doorway
raving
about
rights
under
the
law
and
the
girls
were
deserting
their
machines
during
the
rest
of
that
short
and
successful
strike
bill
constituted
himself
mary
henchman
and
messenger
and
when
it
was
over
returned
to
the
university
to
be
freddie
drummond
and
to
wonder
what
bill
totts
could
see
in
such
a
woman
freddie
drummond
was
entirely
safe
but
bill
had
fallen
in
love
there
was
no
getting
away
from
the
fact
of
it
and
it
was
this
fact
that
had
given
freddie
drummond
his
warning
well
he
had
done
his
work
and
his
adventures
could
cease
there
was
no
need
for
him
to
cross
the
slot
again
all
but
the
last
three
chapters
of
his
latest
tactics
and
was
finished
and
he
had
sufficient
material
on
hand
adequately
to
supply
those
chapters
another
conclusion
he
arrived
at
was
that
in
order
to
himself
as
freddie
drummond
closer
ties
and
relations
in
his
own
social
nook
were
necessary
it
was
time
that
he
was
married
anyway
and
he
was
fully
aware
that
if
freddie
drummond
get
married
bill
totts
assuredly
would
and
the
complications
were
too
awful
to
contemplate
and
so
enters
catherine
van
vorst
she
was
a
college
woman
herself
and
her
father
the
one
wealthy
member
of
the
faculty
was
the
head
of
the
philosophy
department
as
well
it
would
be
a
wise
marriage
from
every
standpoint
freddie
drummond
concluded
when
the
engagement
was
consummated
and
announced
in
appearance
cold
and
reserved
aristocratic
and
wholesomely
conservative
catherine
van
vorst
though
warm
in
her
way
possessed
an
inhibition
equal
to
all
seemed
well
with
him
but
freddie
drummond
could
not
quite
shake
off
the
call
of
the
underworld
the
lure
of
the
free
and
open
of
the
unhampered
irresponsible
life
south
of
the
slot
as
the
time
of
his
marriage
approached
he
felt
that
he
had
indeed
sowed
wild
oats
and
he
felt
moreover
what
a
good
thing
it
would
be
if
he
could
have
but
one
wild
fling
more
play
the
good
fellow
and
the
wastrel
one
last
time
ere
he
settled
down
to
grey
and
sober
matrimony
and
further
to
tempt
him
the
very
last
chapter
of
tactics
and
remained
unwritten
for
lack
of
a
trifle
more
of
essential
data
which
he
had
neglected
to
gather
so
freddie
drummond
went
down
for
the
last
time
as
bill
totts
got
his
data
and
unfortunately
encountered
mary
condon
once
more
installed
in
his
study
it
was
not
a
pleasant
thing
to
look
back
upon
it
made
his
warning
doubly
imperative
bill
totts
had
behaved
abominably
not
only
had
he
met
mary
condon
at
the
central
labour
council
but
he
had
stopped
at
a
with
her
on
the
way
home
and
treated
her
to
oysters
and
before
they
parted
at
her
door
his
arms
had
been
about
her
and
he
had
kissed
her
on
the
lips
and
kissed
her
repeatedly
and
her
last
words
in
his
ear
words
uttered
softly
with
a
catchy
sob
in
the
throat
that
was
nothing
more
nor
less
than
a
love
cry
were
dear
dear
freddie
drummond
shuddered
at
the
recollection
he
saw
the
pit
yawning
for
him
he
was
not
by
nature
a
polygamist
and
he
was
appalled
at
the
possibilities
of
the
situation
it
would
have
to
be
put
an
end
to
and
it
would
end
in
one
only
of
two
ways
either
he
must
become
wholly
bill
totts
and
be
married
to
mary
condon
or
he
must
remain
wholly
freddie
drummond
and
be
married
to
catherine
van
vorst
otherwise
his
conduct
would
be
beneath
contempt
and
horrible
in
the
several
months
that
followed
san
francisco
was
torn
with
labour
strife
the
unions
and
the
associations
had
locked
horns
with
a
determination
that
looked
as
if
they
intended
to
settle
the
matter
one
way
or
the
other
for
all
time
but
freddie
drummond
corrected
proofs
lectured
classes
and
did
not
budge
he
devoted
himself
to
catherine
van
vorst
and
day
by
day
found
more
to
respect
and
admire
in
even
to
love
in
her
the
street
car
strike
tempted
him
but
not
so
severely
as
he
would
have
expected
and
the
great
meat
strike
came
on
and
left
him
cold
the
ghost
of
bill
totts
had
been
successfully
laid
and
freddie
drummond
with
rejuvenescent
zeal
tackled
a
brochure
on
the
topic
of
the
wedding
was
two
weeks
off
when
one
afternoon
in
san
francisco
catherine
van
vorst
picked
him
up
and
whisked
him
away
to
see
a
club
recently
instituted
by
the
settlement
workers
in
whom
she
was
interested
it
was
her
machine
but
they
were
alone
with
the
exception
of
the
chauffeur
at
the
junction
with
kearny
street
market
and
geary
streets
intersect
like
the
sides
of
a
letter
they
in
the
auto
were
coming
down
market
with
the
intention
of
negotiating
the
sharp
apex
and
going
up
geary
but
they
did
not
know
what
was
coming
down
geary
timed
by
fate
to
meet
them
at
the
apex
while
aware
from
the
papers
that
the
meat
strike
was
on
and
that
it
was
an
exceedingly
bitter
one
all
thought
of
it
at
that
moment
was
farthest
from
freddie
mind
was
he
not
seated
beside
catherine
and
besides
he
was
carefully
expositing
to
her
his
views
on
settlement
that
bill
adventures
had
played
a
part
in
formulating
coming
down
geary
street
were
six
meat
waggons
beside
each
scab
driver
sat
a
policeman
front
and
rear
and
along
each
side
of
this
procession
marched
a
protecting
escort
of
one
hundred
police
behind
the
police
rearguard
at
a
respectful
distance
was
an
orderly
but
vociferous
mob
several
blocks
in
length
that
congested
the
street
from
sidewalk
to
sidewalk
the
beef
trust
was
making
an
effort
to
supply
the
hotels
and
incidentally
to
begin
the
breaking
of
the
strike
the
francis
had
already
been
supplied
at
a
cost
of
many
broken
windows
and
broken
heads
and
the
expedition
was
marching
to
the
relief
of
the
palace
hotel
all
unwitting
drummond
sat
beside
catherine
talking
settlement
work
as
the
auto
honking
methodically
and
dodging
traffic
swung
in
a
wide
curve
to
get
around
the
apex
a
big
coal
waggon
loaded
with
lump
coal
and
drawn
by
four
huge
horses
just
debouching
from
kearny
street
as
though
to
turn
down
market
blocked
their
way
the
driver
of
the
waggon
seemed
undecided
and
the
chauffeur
running
slow
but
disregarding
some
shouted
warning
from
the
crossing
policemen
swerved
the
auto
to
the
left
violating
the
traffic
rules
in
order
to
pass
in
front
of
the
waggon
at
that
moment
freddie
drummond
discontinued
his
conversation
nor
did
he
resume
it
again
for
the
situation
was
developing
with
the
rapidity
of
a
transformation
scene
he
heard
the
roar
of
the
mob
at
the
rear
and
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
helmeted
police
and
the
lurching
meat
waggons
at
the
same
moment
laying
on
his
whip
and
standing
up
to
his
task
the
coal
driver
rushed
horses
and
waggon
squarely
in
front
of
the
advancing
procession
pulled
the
horses
up
sharply
and
put
on
the
big
brake
then
he
made
his
lines
fast
to
the
and
sat
down
with
the
air
of
one
who
had
stopped
to
stay
the
auto
had
been
brought
to
a
stop
too
by
his
big
panting
leaders
which
had
jammed
against
it
before
the
chauffeur
could
back
clear
an
old
irishman
driving
a
rickety
express
waggon
and
lashing
his
one
horse
to
a
gallop
had
locked
wheels
with
the
auto
drummond
recognized
both
horse
and
waggon
for
he
had
driven
them
often
himself
the
irishman
was
pat
morrissey
on
the
other
side
a
brewery
waggon
was
locking
with
the
coal
waggon
and
an
kearny
street
car
wildly
clanging
its
gong
the
motorman
shouting
defiance
at
the
crossing
policeman
was
dashing
forward
to
complete
the
blockade
and
waggon
after
waggon
was
locking
and
blocking
and
adding
to
the
confusion
the
meat
waggons
halted
the
police
were
trapped
the
roar
at
the
rear
increased
as
the
mob
came
on
to
the
attack
while
the
vanguard
of
the
police
charged
the
obstructing
waggons
in
for
it
drummond
remarked
coolly
to
catherine
she
nodded
with
equal
coolness
savages
they
his
admiration
for
her
doubled
on
itself
she
was
indeed
his
sort
he
would
have
been
satisfied
with
her
even
if
she
had
screamed
and
clung
to
him
but
was
magnificent
she
sat
in
that
storm
centre
as
calmly
as
if
it
had
been
no
more
than
a
block
of
carriages
at
the
opera
the
police
were
struggling
to
clear
a
passage
the
driver
of
the
coal
waggon
a
big
man
in
shirt
sleeves
lighted
a
pipe
and
sat
smoking
he
glanced
down
complacently
at
a
captain
of
police
who
was
raving
and
cursing
at
him
and
his
only
acknowledgment
was
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
from
the
rear
arose
the
of
clubs
on
heads
and
a
pandemonium
of
cursing
yelling
and
shouting
a
violent
accession
of
noise
proclaimed
that
the
mob
had
broken
through
and
was
dragging
a
scab
from
a
waggon
the
police
captain
reinforced
from
his
vanguard
and
the
mob
at
the
rear
was
repelled
meanwhile
window
after
window
in
the
high
office
building
on
the
right
had
been
opened
and
the
clerks
were
raining
a
shower
of
office
furniture
down
on
the
heads
of
police
and
scabs
and
everything
that
came
to
hand
was
filling
the
air
a
policeman
under
orders
from
his
captain
clambered
to
the
lofty
seat
of
the
coal
waggon
to
arrest
the
driver
and
the
driver
rising
leisurely
and
peacefully
to
meet
him
suddenly
crumpled
him
in
his
arms
and
threw
him
down
on
top
of
the
captain
the
driver
was
a
young
giant
and
when
he
climbed
on
his
load
and
poised
a
lump
of
coal
in
both
hands
a
policeman
who
was
just
scaling
the
waggon
from
the
side
let
go
and
dropped
back
to
earth
the
captain
ordered
of
his
men
to
take
the
waggon
the
teamster
scrambling
over
the
load
from
side
to
side
beat
them
down
with
huge
lumps
of
coal
the
crowd
on
the
sidewalks
and
the
teamsters
on
the
locked
waggons
roared
encouragement
and
their
own
delight
the
motorman
smashing
helmets
with
his
controller
bar
was
beaten
into
insensibility
and
dragged
from
his
platform
the
captain
of
police
beside
himself
at
the
repulse
of
his
men
led
the
next
assault
on
the
coal
waggon
a
score
of
police
were
swarming
up
the
fortress
but
the
teamster
multiplied
himself
at
times
there
were
six
or
eight
policemen
rolling
on
the
pavement
and
under
the
waggon
engaged
in
repulsing
an
attack
on
the
rear
end
of
his
fortress
the
teamster
turned
about
to
see
the
captain
just
in
the
act
of
stepping
on
to
the
seat
from
the
front
end
he
was
still
in
the
air
and
in
most
unstable
equilibrium
when
the
teamster
hurled
a
lump
of
coal
it
caught
the
captain
fairly
on
the
chest
and
he
went
over
backward
striking
on
a
back
tumbling
on
to
the
ground
and
jamming
against
the
rear
wheel
of
the
auto
catherine
thought
he
was
dead
but
he
picked
himself
up
and
charged
back
she
reached
out
her
gloved
hand
and
patted
the
flank
of
the
snorting
quivering
horse
but
drummond
did
not
notice
the
action
he
had
eyes
for
nothing
save
the
battle
of
the
coal
waggon
while
somewhere
in
his
complicated
psychology
one
bill
totts
was
heaving
and
straining
in
an
effort
to
come
to
life
drummond
believed
in
law
and
order
and
the
maintenance
of
the
established
but
this
riotous
savage
within
him
would
have
none
of
it
then
if
ever
did
freddie
drummond
call
upon
his
iron
inhibition
to
save
him
but
it
is
written
that
the
house
divided
against
itself
must
fall
and
freddie
drummond
found
that
he
had
divided
all
the
will
and
force
of
him
with
bill
totts
and
between
them
the
entity
that
constituted
the
pair
of
them
was
being
wrenched
in
twain
freddie
drummond
sat
in
the
auto
quite
composed
alongside
catherine
van
vorst
but
looking
out
of
freddie
eyes
was
bill
totts
and
somewhere
behind
those
eyes
battling
for
the
control
of
their
mutual
body
were
freddie
drummond
the
sane
and
conservative
sociologist
and
bill
totts
the
and
bellicose
union
working
man
it
was
bill
totts
looking
out
of
those
eyes
who
saw
the
inevitable
end
of
the
battle
on
the
coal
waggon
he
saw
a
policeman
gain
the
top
of
the
load
a
second
and
a
third
they
lurched
clumsily
on
the
loose
footing
but
their
long
were
out
and
swinging
one
blow
caught
the
teamster
on
the
head
a
second
he
dodged
receiving
it
on
the
shoulder
for
him
the
game
was
plainly
up
he
dashed
in
suddenly
clutched
two
policemen
in
his
arms
and
hurled
himself
a
prisoner
to
the
pavement
his
hold
never
relaxing
on
his
two
captors
catherine
van
vorst
was
sick
and
faint
at
sight
of
the
blood
and
brutal
fighting
but
her
qualms
were
vanquished
by
the
sensational
and
most
unexpected
happening
that
followed
the
man
beside
her
emitted
an
unearthly
and
uncultured
yell
and
rose
to
his
feet
she
saw
him
spring
over
the
front
seat
leap
to
the
broad
rump
of
the
wheeler
and
from
there
gain
the
waggon
his
onslaught
was
like
a
whirlwind
before
the
bewildered
officer
on
the
load
could
guess
the
errand
of
this
conventionally
clad
but
gentleman
he
was
the
recipient
of
a
punch
that
arched
him
back
through
the
air
to
the
pavement
a
kick
in
the
face
led
an
ascending
policeman
to
follow
his
example
a
rush
of
three
more
gained
the
top
and
locked
with
bill
totts
in
a
gigantic
clinch
during
which
his
scalp
was
opened
up
by
a
club
and
coat
vest
and
half
his
starched
shirt
were
torn
from
him
but
the
three
policemen
were
flung
far
and
wide
and
bill
totts
raining
down
lumps
of
coal
held
the
fort
the
captain
led
gallantly
to
the
attack
but
was
bowled
over
by
a
chunk
of
coal
that
burst
on
his
head
in
black
baptism
the
need
of
the
police
was
to
break
the
blockade
in
front
before
the
mob
could
break
in
at
the
rear
and
bill
need
was
to
hold
the
waggon
till
the
mob
did
break
through
so
the
battle
of
the
coal
went
on
the
crowd
had
recognized
its
champion
bill
as
usual
had
come
to
the
front
and
catherine
van
vorst
was
bewildered
by
the
cries
of
o
you
bill
that
arose
on
every
hand
pat
morrissey
on
his
waggon
seat
was
jumping
and
screaming
in
an
ecstasy
bill
eat
eat
alive
from
the
sidewalk
she
heard
a
voice
cry
out
out
end
bill
took
the
warning
and
with
coal
cleared
the
front
end
of
the
waggon
of
assailants
catherine
van
vorst
turned
her
head
and
saw
on
the
curb
of
the
sidewalk
a
woman
with
vivid
colouring
and
flashing
black
eyes
who
was
staring
with
all
her
soul
at
the
man
who
had
been
freddie
drummond
a
few
minutes
before
the
windows
of
the
office
building
became
vociferous
with
applause
a
fresh
shower
of
office
chairs
and
filing
cabinets
descended
the
mob
had
broken
through
on
one
side
the
line
of
waggons
and
was
advancing
each
segregated
policeman
the
centre
of
a
fighting
group
the
scabs
were
torn
from
their
seats
the
traces
of
the
horses
cut
and
the
frightened
animals
put
in
flight
many
policemen
crawled
under
the
coal
waggon
for
safety
while
the
loose
horses
with
here
and
there
a
policeman
on
their
backs
or
struggling
at
their
heads
to
hold
them
surged
across
the
sidewalk
opposite
the
jam
and
broke
into
market
street
catherine
van
vorst
heard
the
voice
calling
in
warning
she
was
back
on
the
curb
again
and
crying
it
bill
your
time
beat
it
the
police
for
the
moment
had
been
swept
away
bill
totts
leaped
to
the
pavement
and
made
his
way
to
the
woman
on
the
sidewalk
catherine
van
vorst
saw
her
throw
her
arms
around
him
and
kiss
him
on
the
lips
and
catherine
van
vorst
watched
him
curiously
as
he
went
on
down
the
sidewalk
one
arm
around
the
woman
both
talking
and
laughing
and
he
with
a
volubility
and
abandon
she
could
never
have
dreamed
possible
the
police
were
back
again
and
clearing
the
jam
while
waiting
for
reinforcements
and
new
drivers
and
horses
the
mob
had
done
its
work
and
was
scattering
and
catherine
van
vorst
still
watching
could
see
the
man
she
had
known
as
freddie
drummond
he
towered
a
head
above
the
crowd
his
arm
was
still
about
the
woman
and
she
in
the
watching
saw
the
pair
cross
market
street
cross
the
slot
and
disappear
down
third
street
into
the
labour
ghetto
in
the
years
that
followed
no
more
lectures
were
given
in
the
university
of
california
by
one
freddie
drummond
and
no
more
books
on
economics
and
the
labour
question
appeared
over
the
name
of
frederick
drummond
on
the
other
hand
there
arose
a
new
labour
leader
william
totts
by
name
he
it
was
who
married
mary
condon
president
of
the
international
glove
union
no
and
he
it
was
who
called
the
notorious
cooks
and
strike
which
before
its
successful
termination
brought
out
with
it
scores
of
other
unions
among
which
of
the
more
remotely
allied
were
the
chicken
pickers
and
the
undertakers
the
unparalleled
invasion
it
was
in
the
year
that
the
trouble
between
the
world
and
china
reached
its
culmination
it
was
because
of
this
that
the
celebration
of
the
second
centennial
of
american
liberty
was
deferred
many
other
plans
of
the
nations
of
the
earth
were
twisted
and
tangled
and
postponed
for
the
same
reason
the
world
awoke
rather
abruptly
to
its
danger
but
for
over
seventy
years
unperceived
affairs
had
been
shaping
toward
this
very
end
the
year
logically
marks
the
beginning
of
the
development
that
seventy
years
later
was
to
bring
consternation
to
the
whole
world
the
war
took
place
in
and
the
historians
of
the
time
gravely
noted
it
down
that
that
event
marked
the
entrance
of
japan
into
the
comity
of
nations
what
it
really
did
mark
was
the
awakening
of
china
this
awakening
long
expected
had
finally
been
given
up
the
western
nations
had
tried
to
arouse
china
and
they
had
failed
out
of
their
native
optimism
and
they
had
therefore
concluded
that
the
task
was
impossible
that
china
would
never
awaken
what
they
had
failed
to
take
into
account
was
this
between
them
and
china
was
no
common
psychological
their
were
radically
dissimilar
there
was
no
intimate
vocabulary
the
western
mind
penetrated
the
chinese
mind
but
a
short
distance
when
it
found
itself
in
a
fathomless
maze
the
chinese
mind
penetrated
the
western
mind
an
equally
short
distance
when
it
fetched
up
against
a
blank
incomprehensible
wall
it
was
all
a
matter
of
language
there
was
no
way
to
communicate
western
ideas
to
the
chinese
mind
china
remained
asleep
the
material
achievement
and
progress
of
the
west
was
a
closed
book
to
her
nor
could
the
west
open
the
book
back
and
deep
down
on
the
of
consciousness
in
the
mind
say
of
the
race
was
a
capacity
to
thrill
to
short
saxon
words
back
and
deep
down
on
the
of
consciousness
of
the
chinese
mind
was
a
capacity
to
thrill
to
its
own
hieroglyphics
but
the
chinese
mind
could
not
thrill
to
short
saxon
words
nor
could
the
mind
thrill
to
hieroglyphics
the
fabrics
of
their
minds
were
woven
from
totally
different
stuffs
they
were
mental
aliens
and
so
it
was
that
western
material
achievement
and
progress
made
no
dent
on
the
rounded
sleep
of
china
came
japan
and
her
victory
over
russia
in
now
the
japanese
race
was
the
freak
and
paradox
among
eastern
peoples
in
some
strange
way
japan
was
receptive
to
all
the
west
had
to
offer
japan
swiftly
assimilated
the
western
ideas
and
digested
them
and
so
capably
applied
them
that
she
suddenly
burst
forth
a
there
is
no
explaining
this
peculiar
openness
of
japan
to
the
alien
culture
of
the
west
as
well
might
be
explained
any
biological
sport
in
the
animal
kingdom
having
decisively
thrashed
the
great
russian
empire
japan
promptly
set
about
dreaming
a
colossal
dream
of
empire
for
herself
korea
she
had
made
into
a
granary
and
a
colony
treaty
privileges
and
vulpine
diplomacy
gave
her
the
monopoly
of
manchuria
but
japan
was
not
satisfied
she
turned
her
eyes
upon
china
there
lay
a
vast
territory
and
in
that
territory
were
the
hugest
deposits
in
the
world
of
iron
and
backbone
of
industrial
civilization
given
natural
resources
the
other
great
factor
in
industry
is
labour
in
that
territory
was
a
population
of
quarter
of
the
then
total
population
of
the
earth
furthermore
the
chinese
were
excellent
workers
while
their
fatalistic
philosophy
or
religion
and
their
stolid
nervous
organization
constituted
them
splendid
they
were
properly
managed
needless
to
say
japan
was
prepared
to
furnish
that
management
but
best
of
all
from
the
standpoint
of
japan
the
chinese
was
a
kindred
race
the
baffling
enigma
of
the
chinese
character
to
the
west
was
no
baffling
enigma
to
the
japanese
the
japanese
understood
as
we
could
never
school
ourselves
or
hope
to
understand
their
mental
processes
were
the
same
the
japanese
thought
with
the
same
as
did
the
chinese
and
they
thought
in
the
same
peculiar
grooves
into
the
chinese
mind
the
japanese
went
on
where
we
were
balked
by
the
obstacle
of
incomprehension
they
took
the
turning
which
we
could
not
perceive
twisted
around
the
obstacle
and
were
out
of
sight
in
the
ramifications
of
the
chinese
mind
where
we
could
not
follow
they
were
brothers
long
ago
one
had
borrowed
the
written
language
and
untold
generations
before
that
they
had
diverged
from
the
common
mongol
stock
there
had
been
changes
differentiations
brought
about
by
diverse
conditions
and
infusions
of
other
blood
but
down
at
the
bottom
of
their
beings
twisted
into
the
fibres
of
them
was
a
heritage
in
common
a
sameness
in
kind
that
time
had
not
obliterated
and
so
japan
took
upon
herself
the
management
of
china
in
the
years
immediately
following
the
war
with
russia
her
agents
swarmed
over
the
chinese
empire
a
thousand
miles
beyond
the
last
mission
station
toiled
her
engineers
and
spies
clad
as
coolies
under
the
guise
of
itinerant
merchants
or
proselytizing
buddhist
priests
noting
down
the
of
every
waterfall
the
likely
sites
for
factories
the
heights
of
mountains
and
passes
the
strategic
advantages
and
weaknesses
the
wealth
of
the
farming
valleys
the
number
of
bullocks
in
a
district
or
the
number
of
labourers
that
could
be
collected
by
forced
levies
never
was
there
such
a
census
and
it
could
have
been
taken
by
no
other
people
than
the
dogged
patient
patriotic
japanese
but
in
a
short
time
secrecy
was
thrown
to
the
winds
officers
reorganized
the
chinese
army
her
drill
sergeants
made
the
mediæval
warriors
over
into
twentieth
century
soldiers
accustomed
to
all
the
modern
machinery
of
war
and
with
a
higher
average
of
marksmanship
than
the
soldiers
of
any
western
nation
the
engineers
of
japan
deepened
and
widened
the
intricate
system
of
canals
built
factories
and
foundries
netted
the
empire
with
telegraphs
and
telephones
and
inaugurated
the
era
of
it
was
these
same
protagonists
of
that
discovered
the
great
oil
deposits
of
chunsan
the
iron
mountains
of
the
copper
ranges
of
chinchi
and
they
sank
the
gas

of
that
most
marvellous

in
all
the

in

of

were
the

in
the
ears
of
the

whispered
the
japanese
statesmen
the
political
reconstruction
of
the
empire
was
due
to
them
they
evicted
the

was
violently

were
started
of
course
japanese
editors
ran
the
policy
of
these
papers
which
policy
they
got
direct
from
tokio
it
was
these
papers
that
educated
and
made
progressive
the
great
mass
of
the
population
china
was
at
last
awake
where
the
west
had
failed
japan
succeeded
she
had
transmuted
western
culture
and
achievement
into
terms
that
were
intelligible
to
the
chinese
understanding
japan
herself
when
she
so
suddenly
awakened
had
astounded
the
world
but
at
the
time
she
was
only
forty
millions
strong
awakening
with
her
four
hundred
millions
and
the
scientific
advance
of
the
world
was
frightfully
astounding
she
was
the
colossus
of
the
nations
and
swiftly
her
voice
was
heard
in
no
uncertain
tones
in
the
affairs
and
councils
of
the
nations
japan
egged
her
on
and
the
proud
western
peoples
listened
with
respectful
ears
swift
and
remarkable
rise
was
due
perhaps
more
than
to
anything
else
to
the
superlative
quality
of
her
labour
the
chinese
was
the
perfect
type
of
industry
he
had
always
been
that
for
sheer
ability
to
work
no
worker
in
the
world
could
compare
with
him
work
was
the
breath
of
his
nostrils
it
was
to
him
what
wandering
and
fighting
in
far
lands
and
spiritual
adventure
had
been
to
other
peoples
liberty
to
him
epitomized
itself
in
access
to
the
means
of
toil
to
till
the
soil
and
labour
interminably
was
all
he
asked
of
life
and
the
powers
that
be
and
the
awakening
of
china
had
given
its
vast
population
not
merely
free
and
unlimited
access
to
the
means
of
toil
but
access
to
the
highest
and
most
scientific
of
toil
china
rejuvenescent
it
was
but
a
step
to
china
rampant
she
discovered
a
new
pride
in
herself
and
a
will
of
her
own
she
began
to
chafe
under
the
guidance
of
japan
but
she
did
not
chafe
long
on
advice
in
the
beginning
she
had
expelled
from
the
empire
all
western
missionaries
engineers
drill
sergeants
merchants
and
teachers
she
now
began
to
expel
the
similar
representatives
of
japan
the
advisory
statesmen
were
showered
with
honours
and
decorations
and
sent
home
the
west
had
awakened
japan
and
as
japan
had
then
requited
the
west
japan
was
not
requited
by
china
japan
was
thanked
for
her
kindly
aid
and
flung
out
bag
and
baggage
by
her
gigantic
protégé
the
western
nations
chuckled
rainbow
dream
had
gone
glimmering
she
grew
angry
china
laughed
at
her
the
blood
and
the
swords
of
the
samurai
would
out
and
japan
rashly
went
to
war
this
occurred
in
and
in
seven
bloody
months
manchuria
korea
and
formosa
were
taken
away
from
her
and
she
was
hurled
back
bankrupt
to
stifle
in
her
tiny
crowded
islands
exit
japan
from
the
world
drama
thereafter
she
devoted
herself
to
art
and
her
task
became
to
please
the
world
greatly
with
her
creations
of
wonder
and
beauty
contrary
to
expectation
china
did
not
prove
warlike
she
had
no
napoleonic
dream
and
was
content
to
devote
herself
to
the
arts
of
peace
after
a
time
of
disquiet
the
idea
was
accepted
that
china
was
to
be
feared
not
in
war
but
in
commerce
it
will
be
seen
that
the
real
danger
was
not
apprehended
china
went
on
consummating
her
instead
of
a
large
standing
army
she
developed
an
immensely
larger
and
splendidly
efficient
militia
her
navy
was
so
small
that
it
was
the
laughing
stock
of
the
world
nor
did
she
attempt
to
strengthen
her
navy
the
treaty
ports
of
the
world
were
never
entered
by
her
visiting
battleships
the
real
danger
lay
in
the
fecundity
of
her
loins
and
it
was
in
that
the
first
cry
of
alarm
was
raised
for
some
time
all
territories
adjacent
to
china
had
been
grumbling
at
chinese
immigration
but
now
it
suddenly
came
home
to
the
world
that
population
was
she
had
increased
by
a
hundred
millions
since
her
awakening
burchaldter
called
attention
to
the
fact
that
there
were
more
chinese
in
existence
than
people
he
performed
a
simple
sum
in
arithmetic
he
added
together
the
populations
of
the
united
states
canada
new
zealand
australia
south
africa
england
france
germany
italy
austria
european
russia
and
all
scandinavia
the
result
was
and
the
population
of
china
overtopped
this
tremendous
total
by
figures
went
round
the
world
and
the
world
shivered
for
many
centuries
population
had
been
constant
her
territory
had
been
saturated
with
population
that
is
to
say
her
territory
with
the
primitive
method
of
production
had
supported
the
maximum
limit
of
population
but
when
she
awoke
and
inaugurated
the
her
productive
power
had
been
enormously
increased
thus
on
the
same
territory
she
was
able
to
support
a
far
larger
population
at
once
the
birth
rate
began
to
rise
and
the
death
rate
to
fall
before
when
population
pressed
against
the
means
of
subsistence
the
excess
population
had
been
swept
away
by
famine
but
now
thanks
to
the
means
of
subsistence
had
been
enormously
extended
and
there
were
no
famines
her
population
followed
on
the
heels
of
the
increase
in
the
means
of
subsistence
during
this
time
of
transition
and
development
of
power
china
had
entertained
no
dreams
of
conquest
the
chinese
was
not
an
imperial
race
it
was
industrious
thrifty
and
war
was
looked
upon
as
an
unpleasant
but
necessary
task
that
at
times
must
be
performed
and
so
while
the
western
races
had
squabbled
and
fought
and
against
one
another
china
had
calmly
gone
on
working
at
her
machines
and
growing
now
she
was
spilling
over
the
boundaries
of
her
was
all
just
spilling
over
into
the
adjacent
territories
with
all
the
certainty
and
terrifying
slow
momentum
of
a
glacier
following
upon
the
alarm
raised
by
figures
in
france
made
a
stand
french
had
been
overrun
filled
up
by
chinese
immigrants
france
called
a
halt
the
chinese
wave
flowed
on
france
assembled
a
force
of
a
hundred
thousand
on
the
boundary
between
her
unfortunate
colony
and
china
and
china
sent
down
an
army
of
a
million
strong
behind
came
the
wives
and
sons
and
daughters
and
relatives
with
their
personal
household
luggage
in
a
second
army
the
french
force
was
brushed
aside
like
a
fly
the
chinese
along
with
their
families
over
five
millions
all
told
coolly
took
possession
of
french
and
settled
down
to
stay
for
a
few
thousand
years
outraged
france
was
in
arms
she
hurled
fleet
after
fleet
against
the
coast
of
china
and
nearly
bankrupted
herself
by
the
effort
china
had
no
navy
she
withdrew
like
a
turtle
into
her
shell
for
a
year
the
french
fleets
blockaded
the
coast
and
bombarded
exposed
towns
and
villages
china
did
not
mind
she
did
not
depend
upon
the
rest
of
the
world
for
anything
she
calmly
kept
out
of
range
of
the
french
guns
and
went
on
working
france
wept
and
wailed
wrung
her
impotent
hands
and
appealed
to
the
dumfounded
nations
then
she
landed
a
punitive
expedition
to
march
to
peking
it
was
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
strong
and
it
was
the
flower
of
france
it
landed
without
opposition
and
marched
into
the
interior
and
that
was
the
last
ever
seen
of
it
the
line
of
communication
was
snapped
on
the
second
day
not
a
survivor
came
back
to
tell
what
had
happened
it
had
been
swallowed
up
in
cavernous
maw
that
was
all
in
the
five
years
that
followed
expansion
in
all
land
directions
went
on
apace
siam
was
made
part
of
the
empire
and
in
spite
of
all
that
england
could
do
burma
and
the
malay
peninsula
were
overrun
while
all
along
the
long
south
boundary
of
siberia
russia
was
pressed
severely
by
advancing
hordes
the
process
was
simple
first
came
the
chinese
immigration
or
rather
it
was
already
there
having
come
there
slowly
and
insidiously
during
the
previous
years
next
came
the
clash
of
arms
and
the
brushing
away
of
all
opposition
by
a
monster
army
of
followed
by
their
families
and
household
baggage
and
finally
came
their
settling
down
as
colonists
in
the
conquered
territory
never
was
there
so
strange
and
effective
a
method
of
world
conquest
napal
and
bhutan
were
overrun
and
the
whole
northern
boundary
of
india
pressed
against
by
this
fearful
tide
of
life
to
the
west
bokhara
and
even
to
the
south
and
west
afghanistan
were
swallowed
up
persia
turkestan
and
all
central
asia
felt
the
pressure
of
the
flood
it
was
at
this
time
that
burchaldter
revised
his
figures
he
had
been
mistaken
population
must
be
seven
hundred
millions
eight
hundred
millions
nobody
knew
how
many
millions
but
at
any
rate
it
would
soon
be
a
billion
there
were
two
chinese
for
every
human
in
the
world
burchaldter
announced
and
the
world
trembled
increase
must
have
begun
immediately
in
it
was
remembered
that
since
that
date
there
had
not
been
a
single
famine
at
a
year
increase
her
total
increase
in
the
intervening
seventy
years
must
be
but
who
was
to
know
it
might
be
more
who
was
to
know
anything
of
this
strange
new
menace
of
the
twentieth
old
china
rejuvenescent
fruitful
and
militant
the
convention
of
was
called
at
philadelphia
all
the
western
nations
and
some
few
of
the
eastern
were
represented
nothing
was
accomplished
there
was
talk
of
all
countries
putting
bounties
on
children
to
increase
the
birth
rate
but
it
was
laughed
to
scorn
by
the
arithmeticians
who
pointed
out
that
china
was
too
far
in
the
lead
in
that
direction
no
feasible
way
of
coping
with
china
was
suggested
china
was
appealed
to
and
threatened
by
the
united
powers
and
that
was
all
the
convention
of
philadelphia
came
to
and
the
convention
and
the
powers
were
laughed
at
by
china
li
tang
fwung
the
power
behind
the
dragon
throne
deigned
to
reply
does
china
care
for
the
comity
of
nations
said
li
tang
fwung
are
the
most
ancient
honourable
and
royal
of
races
we
have
our
own
destiny
to
accomplish
it
is
unpleasant
that
our
destiny
does
not
tally
with
the
destiny
of
the
rest
of
the
world
but
what
would
you
you
have
talked
windily
about
the
royal
races
and
the
heritage
of
the
earth
and
we
can
only
reply
that
that
remains
to
be
seen
you
can
not
invade
us
never
mind
about
your
navies
shout
we
know
our
navy
is
small
you
see
we
use
it
for
police
purposes
we
do
not
care
for
the
sea
our
strength
is
in
our
population
which
will
soon
be
a
billion
thanks
to
you
we
are
equipped
with
all
modern
send
your
navies
we
will
not
notice
them
send
your
punitive
expeditions
but
first
remember
france
to
land
half
a
million
soldiers
on
our
shores
would
strain
the
resources
of
any
of
you
and
our
thousand
millions
would
swallow
them
down
in
a
mouthful
send
a
million
send
five
millions
and
we
will
swallow
them
down
just
as
readily
pouf
a
mere
nothing
a
meagre
morsel
destroy
as
you
have
threatened
you
united
states
the
ten
million
coolies
we
have
forced
upon
your
the
amount
scarcely
equals
half
of
our
excess
birth
rate
for
a
so
spoke
li
tang
fwung
the
world
was
nonplussed
helpless
terrified
truly
had
he
spoken
there
was
no
combating
amazing
birth
rate
if
her
population
was
a
billion
and
was
increasing
twenty
millions
a
year
in
years
it
would
be
a
billion
and
a
to
the
total
population
of
the
world
in
and
nothing
could
be
done
there
was
no
way
to
dam
up
the
monstrous
flood
of
life
war
was
futile
china
laughed
at
a
blockade
of
her
coasts
she
welcomed
invasion
in
her
capacious
maw
was
room
for
all
the
hosts
of
earth
that
could
be
hurled
at
her
and
in
the
meantime
her
flood
of
yellow
life
poured
out
and
on
over
asia
china
laughed
and
read
in
their
magazines
the
learned
lucubrations
of
the
distracted
western
scholars
but
there
was
one
scholar
china
failed
to
reckon
laningdale
not
that
he
was
a
scholar
except
in
the
widest
sense
primarily
jacobus
laningdale
was
a
scientist
and
up
to
that
time
a
very
obscure
scientist
a
professor
employed
in
the
laboratories
of
the
health
office
of
new
york
city
jacobus
head
was
very
like
any
other
head
but
in
that
head
was
evolved
an
idea
also
in
that
head
was
the
wisdom
to
keep
that
idea
secret
he
did
not
write
an
article
for
the
magazines
instead
he
asked
for
a
vacation
on
september
he
arrived
in
washington
it
was
evening
but
he
proceeded
straight
to
the
white
house
for
he
had
already
arranged
an
audience
with
the
president
he
was
closeted
with
president
moyer
for
three
hours
what
passed
between
them
was
not
learned
by
the
rest
of
the
world
until
long
after
in
fact
at
that
time
the
world
was
not
interested
in
jacobus
laningdale
next
day
the
president
called
in
his
cabinet
jacobus
laningdale
was
present
the
proceedings
were
kept
secret
but
that
very
afternoon
rufus
cowdery
secretary
of
state
left
washington
and
early
the
following
morning
sailed
for
england
the
secret
that
he
carried
began
to
spread
but
it
spread
only
among
the
heads
of
governments
possibly
men
in
a
nation
were
entrusted
with
the
idea
that
had
formed
in
jacobus
head
following
the
spread
of
the
secret
sprang
up
great
activity
in
all
the
dockyards
arsenals
and
the
people
of
france
and
austria
became
suspicious
but
so
sincere
were
their
calls
for
confidence
that
they
acquiesced
in
the
unknown
project
that
was
afoot
this
was
the
time
of
the
great
truce
all
countries
pledged
themselves
solemnly
not
to
go
to
war
with
any
other
country
the
first
definite
action
was
the
gradual
mobilization
of
the
armies
of
russia
germany
austria
italy
greece
and
turkey
then
began
the
eastward
movement
all
railroads
into
asia
were
glutted
with
troop
trains
china
was
the
objective
that
was
all
that
was
known
a
little
later
began
the
great
sea
movement
expeditions
of
warships
were
launched
from
all
countries
fleet
followed
fleet
and
all
proceeded
to
the
coast
of
china
the
nations
cleaned
out
their
they
sent
their
revenue
cutters
and
dispatch
boats
and
lighthouse
tenders
and
they
sent
their
last
antiquated
cruisers
and
battleships
not
content
with
this
they
impressed
the
merchant
marine
the
statistics
show
that
merchant
steamers
equipped
with
searchlights
and
guns
were
despatched
by
the
various
nations
to
china
and
china
smiled
and
waited
on
her
land
side
along
her
boundaries
were
millions
of
the
warriors
of
europe
she
mobilized
five
times
as
many
millions
of
her
militia
and
awaited
the
invasion
on
her
sea
coasts
she
did
the
same
but
china
was
puzzled
after
all
this
enormous
preparation
there
was
no
invasion
she
could
not
understand
along
the
great
siberian
frontier
all
was
quiet
along
her
coasts
the
towns
and
villages
were
not
even
shelled
never
in
the
history
of
the
world
had
there
been
so
mighty
a
gathering
of
war
fleets
the
fleets
of
all
the
world
were
there
and
day
and
night
millions
of
tons
of
battleships
ploughed
the
brine
of
her
coasts
and
nothing
happened
nothing
was
attempted
did
they
think
to
make
her
emerge
from
her
shell
china
smiled
did
they
think
to
tire
her
out
or
starve
her
out
china
smiled
again
but
on
may
had
the
reader
been
in
the
imperial
city
of
peking
with
its
then
population
of
eleven
millions
he
would
have
witnessed
a
curious
sight
he
would
have
seen
the
streets
filled
with
the
chattering
yellow
populace
every
queued
head
tilted
back
every
slant
eye
turned
skyward
and
high
up
in
the
blue
he
would
have
beheld
a
tiny
dot
of
black
which
because
of
its
orderly
evolutions
he
would
have
identified
as
an
airship
from
this
airship
as
it
curved
its
flight
back
and
forth
over
the
city
fell
harmless
missiles
tubes
of
fragile
glass
that
shattered
into
thousands
of
fragments
on
the
streets
and
but
there
was
nothing
deadly
about
these
tubes
of
glass
nothing
happened
there
were
no
explosions
it
is
true
three
chinese
were
killed
by
the
tubes
dropping
on
their
heads
from
so
enormous
a
height
but
what
were
three
chinese
against
an
excess

had
the
reader
again
been
in

six
weeks
later
he
would
have
looked
in

for
the
eleven
million
inhabitants
some
few
of
them
he
would
have
found
a
few
hundred
thousand
perhaps
their
carcasses
festering
in

in

piled

for

of

of

by

he

and
as
it
was
with

so
it
was
with
all
the
cities
towns
and
villages
of
the
empire
the
plague
smote
them
all
nor
was
it
one
plague
nor
two
plagues
it
was
a
score
of
plagues
every
virulent
form
of
infectious
death
stalked
through
the
land
too
late
the
chinese
government
apprehended
the
meaning
of
the
colossal
preparations
the
marshalling
of
the
the
flights
of
the
tin
airships
and
the
rain
of
the
tubes
of
glass
the
proclamations
of
the
government
were
vain
they
could
not
stop
the
eleven
million
wretches
fleeing
from
the
one
city
of
peking
to
spread
disease
through
all
the
land
the

officers
died
at

and
death

palace
died
in

had
there
been
one
plague
china
might
have
coped
with
it
but
from
a
score
of
plagues
no
creature
was
immune
the
man
who
escaped
smallpox
went
down
before
scarlet
fever
the
man
who
was
immune
to
yellow
fever
was
carried
away
by
cholera
and
if
he
were
immune
to
that
too
the
black
death
which
was
the
bubonic
plague
swept
him
away
for
it
was
these
bacteria
and
germs
and
microbes
and
bacilli
cultured
in
the
laboratories
of
the
west
that
had
come
down
upon
china
in
the
rain
of
glass
all
organization
vanished
the
government
crumbled
away
decrees
and
proclamations
were
useless
when
the
men
who
made
them
and
signed
them
one
moment
were
dead
the
next
nor
could
the
maddened
millions
spurred
on
to
flight
by
death
pause
to
heed
anything
they
fled
from
the
cities
to
infect
the
country
and
wherever
they
fled
they
carried
the
plagues
with
them
the
hot
summer
was
laningdale
had
selected
the
time
the
plague
festered
everywhere
much
is
conjectured
of
what
occurred
and
much
has
been
learned
from
the
stories
of
the
few
survivors
the
wretched
creatures
stormed
across
the
empire
in
flight
the
vast
armies
china
had
collected
on
her
frontiers
melted
away
the
farms
were
ravaged
for
food
and
no
more
crops
were
planted
while
the
crops
already
in
were
left
unattended
and
never
came
to
harvest
the
most
remarkable
thing
perhaps
was
the
flights
many
millions
engaged
in
them
charging
to
the
bounds
of
the
empire
to
be
met
and
turned
back
by
the
gigantic
armies
of
the
west
the
slaughter
of
the
mad
hosts
on
the
boundaries
was
stupendous
time
and
again
the
guarding
line
was
drawn
back
twenty
or
thirty
miles
to
escape
the
contagion
of
the
multitudinous
dead
once
the
plague
broke
through
and
seized
upon
the
german
and
austrian
soldiers
who
were
guarding
the
borders
of
turkestan
preparations
had
been
made
for
such
a
happening
and
though
sixty
thousand
soldiers
of
europe
were
carried
off
the
international
corps
of
physicians
isolated
the
contagion
and
dammed
it
back
it
was
during
this
struggle
that
it
was
suggested
that
a
new
had
originated
that
in
some
way
or
other
a
sort
of
hybridization
between
had
taken
place
producing
a
new
and
frightfully
virulent
germ
first
suspected
by
vomberg
who
became
infected
with
it
and
died
it
was
later
isolated
and
studied
by
stevens
hazenfelt
norman
and
landers
such
was
the
unparalleled
invasion
of
china
for
that
billion
of
people
there
was
no
hope
pent
in
their
vast
and
festering
all
organization
and
cohesion
lost
they
could
do
naught
but
die
they
could
not
escape
as
they
were
flung
back
from
their
land
frontiers
so
were
they
flung
back
from
the
sea
thousand
vessels
patrolled
the
coasts
by
day
their
smoking
funnels
dimmed
the
and
by
night
their
flashing
searchlights
ploughed
the
dark
and
harrowed
it
for
the
tiniest

junk
the
attempts
of
the
immense
fleets
of

were
pitiful
not

the

the

did

was
made
a

of
laughter
naught
remained

but
patrol

china
had
laughed
at
war
and
war
she
was
getting
but
it
was
war
twentieth
century
war
the
war
of
the
scientist
and
the

the
war
of
jacobus
laningdale
guns
were
toys
compared
with
the
projectiles
hurled
from

the

the
destroying
angels
that
stalked
through
the
empire
of
a
billion
souls
during
all
the
summer
and

of
china
was
an
inferno
there
was
no

the
microscopic
projectiles
that
sought

the
hundreds
of
millions
of
dead
remained
unburied
and
the

multiplied
themselves

toward
the
last
millions
died
daily
of

besides
starvation
weakened
the
victims
and
destroyed
their
natural
defences
against

plagues
cannibalism
murder
and
madness
reigned
and
so
perished
china
not
until
the
following
february
in
the
coldest
weather
were
the
first
expeditions
made
these
expeditions
were
small
composed
of
scientists
and
bodies
of
troops
but
they
entered
china
from
every
side
in
spite
of
the
most
elaborate
precautions
against
infection
numbers
of
soldiers
and
a
few
of
the
physicians
were
stricken
but
the
exploration
went
bravely
on
they
found
china
devastated
a
howling
wilderness
through
which
wandered
bands
of
wild
dogs
and
desperate
bandits
who
had
survived
all
survivors
were
put
to
death
wherever
found
and
then
began
the
great
task
the
sanitation
of
china
five
years
and
hundreds
of
millions
of
treasure
were
consumed
and
then
the
world
moved
in
zones
as
was
the
idea
of
baron
albrecht
but
heterogeneously
according
to
the
democratic
american
programme
it
was
a
vast
and
happy
intermingling
of
nationalities
that
settled
down
in
china
in
and
the
years
that
tremendous
and
successful
experiment
in
we
know
the
splendid
mechanical
intellectual
and
art
output
that
followed
it
was
in
the
great
truce
having
been
dissolved
that
the
ancient
quarrel
between
france
and
germany
over
recrudesced
the
grew
dark
and
threatening
in
april
and
on
april
the
convention
of
copenhagen
was
called
the
representatives
of
the
nations
of
the
world
being
present
all
nations
solemnly
pledged
themselves
never
to
use
against
one
another
the
laboratory
methods
of

they
had
employed
in
the
invasion
of
china
from

in

of

it
was
silas

who
finally
ran
down
that
scientific
wizard
and
of
mankind
emil
gluck
confession
before
he
went
to
the
electric
chair
threw
much
light
upon
the
series
of
mysterious
events
many
apparently
unrelated
that
so
perturbed
the
world
between
the
years
and
it
was
not
until
that
remarkable
document
was
made
public
that
the
world
dreamed
of
there
being
any
connection
between
the
assassination
of
the
king
and
queen
of
portugal
and
the
murders
of
the
new
york
city
police
officers
while
the
deeds
of
emil
gluck
were
all
that
was
abominable
we
can
not
but
feel
to
a
certain
extent
pity
for
the
unfortunate
malformed
and
maltreated
genius
this
side
of
his
story
has
never
been
told
before
and
from
his
confession
and
from
the
great
mass
of
evidence
and
the
documents
and
records
of
the
time
we
are
able
to
construct
a
fairly
accurate
portrait
of
him
and
to
discern
the
factors
and
pressures
that
moulded
him
into
the
human
monster
he
became
and
that
drove
him
onward
and
downward
along
the
fearful
path
he
trod
emil
gluck
was
born
in
syracuse
new
york
in
his
father
josephus
gluck
was
a
special
policeman
and
night
watchman
who
in
the
year
died
suddenly
of
pneumonia
the
mother
a
pretty
fragile
creature
who
before
her
marriage
had
been
a
milliner
grieved
herself
to
death
over
the
loss
of
her
husband
this
sensitiveness
of
the
mother
was
the
heritage
that
in
the
boy
became
morbid
and
horrible
in
the
boy
emil
then
six
years
of
age
went
to
live
with
his
aunt
ann
bartell
she
was
his
sister
but
in
her
breast
was
no
kindly
feeling
for
the
sensitive
shrinking
boy
ann
bartell
was
a
vain
shallow
and
heartless
woman
also
she
was
cursed
with
poverty
and
burdened
with
a
husband
who
was
a
lazy
erratic
young
emil
gluck
was
not
wanted
and
ann
bartell
could
be
trusted
to
impress
this
fact
sufficiently
upon
him
as
an
illustration
of
the
treatment
he
received
in
that
early
formative
period
the
following
instance
is
given
when
he
had
been
living
in
the
bartell
home
a
little
more
than
a
year
he
broke
his
leg
he
sustained
the
injury
through
playing
on
the
forbidden
all
boys
have
done
and
will
continue
to
do
to
the
end
of
time
the
leg
was
broken
in
two
places
between
the
knee
and
thigh
emil
helped
by
his
frightened
playmates
managed
to
drag
himself
to
the
front
sidewalk
where
he
fainted
the
children
of
the
neighbourhood
were
afraid
of
the
shrew
who
presided
over
the
bartell
house
but
summoning
their
resolution
they
rang
the
bell
and
told
ann
bartell
of
the
accident
she
did
not
even
look
at
the
little
lad
who
lay
stricken
on
the
sidewalk
but
slammed
the
door
and
went
back
to
her
the
time
passed
a
drizzle
came
on
and
emil
gluck
out
of
his
faint
lay
sobbing
in
the
rain
the
leg
should
have
been
set
immediately
as
it
was
the
inflammation
rose
rapidly
and
made
a
nasty
case
of
it
at
the
end
of
two
hours
the
indignant
women
of
the
neighbourhood
protested
to
ann
bartell
this
time
she
came
out
and
looked
at
the
lad
also
she
kicked
him
in
the
side
as
he
lay
helpless
at
her
feet
and
she
hysterically
disowned
him
he
was
not
her
child
she
said
and
recommended
that
the
ambulance
be
called
to
take
him
to
the
city
receiving
hospital
then
she
went
back
into
the
house
it
was
a
woman
elizabeth
shepstone
who
came
along
learned
the
situation
and
had
the
boy
placed
on
a
shutter
it
was
she
who
called
the
doctor
and
who
brushing
aside
ann
bartell
had
the
boy
carried
into
the
house
when
the
doctor
arrived
ann
bartell
promptly
warned
him
that
she
would
not
pay
him
for
his
services
for
two
months
the
little
emil
lay
in
bed
the
first
month
on
his
back
without
once
being
turned
over
and
he
lay
neglected
and
alone
save
for
the
occasional
visits
of
the
unremunerated
and
physician
he
had
no
toys
nothing
with
which
to
beguile
the
long
and
tedious
hours
no
kind
word
was
spoken
to
him
no
soothing
hand
laid
upon
his
brow
no
single
touch
or
act
of
loving
but
the
reproaches
and
harshness
of
ann
bartell
and
the
continually
reiterated
information
that
he
was
not
wanted
and
it
can
well
be
understood
in
such
environment
how
there
was
generated
in
the
lonely
neglected
boy
much
of
the
bitterness
and
hostility
for
his
kind
that
later
was
to
express
itself
in
deeds
so
frightful
as
to
terrify
the
world
it
would
seem
strange
that
from
the
hands
of
ann
bartell
emil
gluck
should
have
received
a
college
education
but
the
explanation
is
simple
her
husband
deserting
her
made
a
strike
in
the
nevada
goldfields
and
returned
to
her
a
millionaire
ann
bartell
hated
the
boy
and
immediately
she
sent
him
to
the
farristown
academy
a
hundred
miles
away
shy
and
sensitive
a
lonely
and
misunderstood
little
soul
he
was
more
lonely
than
ever
at
farristown
he
never
came
home
at
vacation
and
holidays
as
the
other
boys
did
instead
he
wandered
about
the
deserted
buildings
and
grounds
befriended
and
misunderstood
by
the
servants
and
gardeners
reading
much
it
is
remembered
spending
his
days
in
the
fields
or
before
the
with
his
nose
poked
always
in
the
pages
of
some
book
it
was
at
this
time
that
he
his
eyes
and
was
compelled
to
take
up
the
wearing
of
glasses
which
same
were
so
prominent
in
the
photographs
of
him
published
in
the
newspapers
in
he
was
a
remarkable
student
application
such
as
his
would
have
taken
him
far
but
he
did
not
need
application
a
glance
at
a
text
meant
mastery
for
him
the
result
was
that
he
did
an
immense
amount
of
collateral
reading
and
acquired
more
in
half
a
year
than
did
the
average
student
in
years
in
barely
fourteen
years
of
age
he
was
than
the
headmaster
of
the
academy
enter
yale
or
harvard
his
juvenility
prevented
him
from
entering
those
universities
and
so
in
we
find
him
a
freshman
at
historic
bowdoin
college
in
he
graduated
with
highest
honours
and
immediately
afterward
followed
professor
bradlough
to
berkeley
california
the
one
friend
that
emil
gluck
discovered
in
all
his
life
was
professor
bradlough
the
weak
lungs
had
led
him
to
exchange
maine
for
california
the
removal
being
facilitated
by
the
offer
of
a
professorship
in
the
state
university
throughout
the
year
emil
gluck
resided
in
berkeley
and
took
special
scientific
courses
toward
the
end
of
that
year
two
deaths
changed
his
prospects
and
his
relations
with
life
the
death
of
professor
bradlough
took
from
him
the
one
friend
he
was
ever
to
know
and
the
death
of
ann
bartell
left
him
penniless
hating
the
unfortunate
lad
to
the
last
she
cut
him
off
with
one
hundred
dollars
the
following
year
at
twenty
years
of
age
emil
gluck
was
enrolled
as
an
instructor
of
chemistry
in
the
university
of
california
here
the
years
passed
quietly
he
faithfully
performed
the
drudgery
that
brought
him
his
salary
and
a
student
always
he
took
degrees
he
was
among
other
things
a
doctor
of
sociology
of
philosophy
and
of
science
though
he
was
known
to
the
world
in
later
days
only
as
professor
gluck
he
was
years
old
when
he
first
sprang
into
prominence
in
the
newspapers
through
the
publication
of
his
book
and
the
book
remains
a
milestone
in
the
history
and
philosophy
of
marriage
it
is
a
heavy
tome
of
over
seven
hundred
pages
painfully
careful
and
accurate
and
startlingly
original
it
was
a
book
for
scientists
and
not
one
calculated
to
make
a
stir
but
gluck
in
the
last
chapter
using
barely
three
lines
for
it
mentioned
the
hypothetical
desirability
of
trial
marriages
at
once
the
newspapers
seized
these
three
lines
them
up
yellow
as
the
slang
was
in
those
days
and
set
the
whole
world
laughing
at
emil
gluck
the
bespectacled
young
professor
of
photographers
snapped
him
he
was
besieged
by
reporters
clubs
throughout
the
land
passed
resolutions
condemning
him
and
his
immoral
theories
and
on
the
floor
of
the
california
assembly
while
discussing
the
state
appropriation
to
the
university
a
motion
demanding
the
expulsion
of
gluck
was
made
under
threat
of
withholding
the
course
none
of
his
persecutors
had
read
the
book
the
twisted
newspaper
version
of
only
three
lines
of
it
was
enough
for
them
here
began
emil
hatred
for
newspaper
men
by
them
his
serious
and
intrinsically
valuable
work
of
six
years
had
been
made
a
and
a
notoriety
to
his
dying
day
and
to
their
everlasting
regret
he
never
forgave
them
it
was
the
newspapers
that
were
responsible
for
the
next
disaster
that
befell
him
for
the
five
years
following
the
publication
of
his
book
he
had
remained
silent
and
silence
for
a
lonely
man
is
not
good
one
can
conjecture
sympathetically
the
awful
solitude
of
emil
gluck
in
that
populous
university
for
he
was
without
friends
and
without
sympathy
his
only
recourse
was
books
and
he
went
on
reading
and
studying
enormously
but
in
he
accepted
an
invitation
to
appear
before
the
human
interest
society
of
emeryville
he
did
not
trust
himself
to
speak
and
as
we
write
we
have
before
us
a
copy
of
his
learned
paper
it
is
sober
scholarly
and
scientific
and
it
must
also
be
added
conservative
but
in
one
place
he
dealt
with
and
i
quote
his
words
industrial
and
social
revolution
that
is
taking
place
in
a
reporter
present
seized
upon
the
word
divorced
it
from
the
text
and
wrote
a
garbled
account
that
made
emil
gluck
appear
an
anarchist
at
once
gluck
anarchist
flamed
over
the
wires
and
was
appropriately
in
all
the
newspapers
in
the
land
he
had
attempted
to
reply
to
the
previous
newspaper
attack
but
now
he
remained
silent
bitterness
had
already
corroded
his
soul
the
university
faculty
appealed
to
him
to
defend
himself
but
he
sullenly
declined
even
refusing
to
enter
in
defence
a
copy
of
his
paper
to
save
himself
from
expulsion
he
refused
to
resign
and
was
discharged
from
the
university
faculty
it
must
be
added
that
political
pressure
had
been
put
upon
the
university
regents
and
the
president
persecuted
maligned
and
misunderstood
the
forlorn
and
lonely
man
made
no
attempt
at
retaliation
all
his
life
he
had
been
sinned
against
and
all
his
life
he
had
sinned
against
no
one
but
his
cup
of
bitterness
was
not
yet
full
to
overflowing
having
lost
his
position
and
being
without
any
income
he
had
to
find
work
his
first
place
was
at
the
union
iron
works
in
san
francisco
where
he
proved
a
most
able
draughtsman
it
was
here
that
he
obtained
his
firsthand
knowledge
of
battleships
and
their
construction
but
the
reporters
discovered
him
and
featured
him
in
his
new
vocation
he
immediately
resigned
and
found
another
place
but
after
the
reporters
had
driven
him
away
from
positions
he
steeled
himself
to
brazen
out
the
newspaper
persecution
this
occurred
when
he
started
his
electroplating
oakland
on
telegraph
avenue
it
was
a
small
shop
employing
three
men
and
two
boys
gluck
himself
worked
long
hours
night
after
night
as
policeman
carew
testified
on
the
stand
he
did
not
leave
the
shop
till
one
and
two
in
the
morning
it
was
during
this
period
that
he
perfected
the
improved
ignition
device
for
the
royalties
from
which
ultimately
made
him
wealthy
he
started
his
electroplating
establishment
early
in
the
spring
of
and
it
was
in
the
same
year
that
he
formed
the
disastrous
love
attachment
for
irene
tackley
now
it
is
not
to
be
imagined
that
an
extraordinary
creature
such
as
emil
gluck
could
be
any
other
than
an
extraordinary
lover
in
addition
to
his
genius
his
loneliness
and
his
morbidness
it
must
be
taken
into
consideration
that
he
knew
nothing
about
women
whatever
tides
of
desire
flooded
his
being
he
was
unschooled
in
the
conventional
expression
of
them
while
his
excessive
timidity
was
bound
to
make
his
unusual
irene
tackley
was
a
rather
pretty
young
woman
but
shallow
and
at
the
time
she
worked
in
a
small
candy
store
across
the
street
from
shop
he
used
to
come
in
and
drink
sodas
and
and
stare
at
her
it
seems
the
girl
did
not
care
for
him
and
merely
played
with
him
he
was
she
said
and
at
another
time
she
called
him
a
crank
when
describing
how
he
sat
at
the
counter
and
peered
at
her
through
his
spectacles
blushing
and
stammering
when
she
took
notice
of
him
and
often
leaving
the
shop
in
precipitate
confusion
gluck
made
her
the
most
amazing
silver
a
diamond
ring
a
set
of
furs
a
ponderous
of
the
in
many
volumes
and
a
all
in
his
own
shop
enters
now
the
lover
putting
his
foot
down
showing
great
anger
compelling
her
to
return
strange
assortment
of
presents
this
man
william
sherbourne
was
a
gross
and
stolid
creature
a
man
of
the
working
class
who
had
become
a
successful
in
a
small
way
gluck
did
not
understand
he
tried
to
get
an
explanation
attempting
to
speak
with
the
girl
when
she
went
home
from
work
in
the
evening
she
complained
to
sherbourne
and
one
night
he
gave
gluck
a
beating
it
was
a
very
severe
beating
for
it
is
on
the
records
of
the
red
cross
emergency
hospital
that
gluck
was
treated
there
that
night
and
was
unable
to
leave
the
hospital
for
a
week
still
gluck
did
not
understand
he
continued
to
seek
an
explanation
from
the
girl
in
fear
of
sherbourne
he
applied
to
the
chief
of
police
for
permission
to
carry
a
revolver
which
permission
was
refused
the
newspapers
as
usual
playing
it
up
sensationally
then
came
the
murder
of
irene
tackley
six
days
before
her
contemplated
marriage
with
sherbourne
it
was
on
a
saturday
night
she
had
worked
late
in
the
candy
store
departing
after
eleven
with
her
wages
in
her
purse
she
rode
on
a
san
pablo
avenue
surface
car
to
street
where
she
alighted
and
started
to
walk
the
three
blocks
to
her
home
that
was
the
last
seen
of
her
alive
next
morning
she
was
found
strangled
in
a
vacant
lot
emil
gluck
was
immediately
arrested
nothing
that
he
could
do
could
save
him
he
was
convicted
not
merely
on
circumstantial
evidence
but
on
evidence
by
the
oakland
police
there
is
no
discussion
but
that
a
large
portion
of
the
evidence
was
manufactured
the
testimony
of
captain
shehan
was
the
sheerest
perjury
it
being
proved
long
afterward
that
on
the
night
in
question
he
had
not
only
not
been
in
the
vicinity
of
the
murder
but
that
he
had
been
out
of
the
city
in
a
resort
on
the
san
leandro
road
the
unfortunate
gluck
received
life
imprisonment
in
san
quentin
while
the
newspapers
and
the
public
held
that
it
was
a
miscarriage
of
the
death
penalty
should
have
been
visited
upon
him
gluck
entered
san
quentin
prison
on
april
he
was
then
years
of
age
and
for
three
years
and
a
half
much
of
the
time
in
solitary
confinement
he
was
left
to
meditate
upon
the
injustice
of
man
it
was
during
that
period
that
his
bitterness
corroded
home
and
he
became
a
hater
of
all
his
kind
three
other
things
he
did
during
the
same
period
he
wrote
his
famous
treatise
his
remarkable
brochure
criminal
and
he
worked
out
his
awful
and
monstrous
scheme
of
revenge
it
was
an
episode
that
had
occurred
in
his
electroplating
establishment
that
suggested
to
him
his
unique
weapon
of
revenge
as
stated
in
his
confession
he
worked
every
detail
out
theoretically
during
his
imprisonment
and
was
able
on
his
release
immediately
to
embark
on
his
career
of
vengeance
his
release
was
sensational
also
it
was
miserably
and
criminally
delayed
by
the
soulless
legal
red
tape
then
in
vogue
on
the
night
of
february
tim
haswell
a
man
was
shot
during
an
attempted
robbery
by
a
citizen
of
piedmont
heights
tim
haswell
lingered
three
days
during
which
time
he
not
only
confessed
to
the
murder
of
irene
tackley
but
furnished
conclusive
proofs
of
the
same
bert
danniker
a
convict
dying
of
consumption
in
folsom
prison
was
implicated
as
accessory
and
his
confession
followed
it
is
inconceivable
to
us
of
bungling
dilatory
processes
of
justice
a
generation
ago
emil
gluck
was
proved
in
february
to
be
an
innocent
man
yet
he
was
not
released
until
the
following
october
for
eight
months
a
greatly
wronged
man
he
was
compelled
to
undergo
his
unmerited
punishment
this
was
not
conducive
to
sweetness
and
light
and
we
can
well
imagine
how
he
ate
his
soul
with
bitterness
during
those
dreary
eight
months
he
came
back
to
the
world
in
the
fall
of
as
usual
a
topic
in
all
the
newspapers
the
papers
instead
of
expressing
heartfelt
regret
continued
their
old
sensational
persecution
one
paper
did
francisco
john
hartwell
its
editor
elaborated
an
ingenious
theory
that
got
around
the
confessions
of
the
two
criminals
and
went
to
show
that
gluck
was
responsible
after
all
for
the
murder
of
irene
tackley
hartwell
died
and
sherbourne
died
too
while
policeman
phillipps
was
shot
in
the
leg
and
discharged
from
the
oakland
police
force
the
murder
of
hartwell
was
long
a
mystery
he
was
alone
in
his
editorial
office
at
the
time
the
reports
of
the
revolver
were
heard
by
the
office
boy
who
rushed
in
to
find
hartwell
expiring
in
his
chair
what
puzzled
the
police
was
the
fact
not
merely
that
he
had
been
shot
with
his
own
revolver
but
that
the
revolver
had
been
exploded
in
the
drawer
of
his
desk
the
bullets
had
torn
through
the
front
of
the
drawer
and
entered
his
body
the
police
scouted
the
theory
of
suicide
murder
was
dismissed
as
absurd
and
the
blame
was
thrown
upon
the
eureka
smokeless
cartridge
company
spontaneous
explosion
was
the
police
explanation
and
the
chemists
of
the
cartridge
company
were
well
bullied
at
the
inquest
but
what
the
police
did
not
know
was
that
across
the
street
in
the
mercer
building
room
rented
by
emil
gluck
had
been
occupied
by
emil
gluck
at
the
very
moment
revolver
so
mysteriously
exploded
at
the
time
no
connection
was
made
between
death
and
the
death
of
william
sherbourne
sherbourne
had
continued
to
live
in
the
home
he
had
built
for
irene
tackley
and
one
morning
in
january
he
was
found
dead
suicide
was
the
verdict
of
the
inquest
for
he
had
been
shot
by
his
own
revolver
the
curious
thing
that
happened
that
night
was
the
shooting
of
policeman
phillipps
on
the
sidewalk
in
front
of
house
the
policeman
crawled
to
a
police
telephone
on
the
corner
and
rang
up
for
an
ambulance
he
claimed
that
some
one
had
shot
him
from
behind
in
the
leg
the
leg
in
question
was
so
badly
shattered
by
three
calibre
bullets
that
amputation
was
necessary
but
when
the
police
discovered
that
the
damage
had
been
done
by
his
own
revolver
a
great
laugh
went
up
and
he
was
charged
with
having
been
drunk
in
spite
of
his
denial
of
having
touched
a
drop
and
of
his
persistent
assertion
that
the
revolver
had
been
in
his
hip
pocket
and
that
he
had
not
laid
a
finger
to
it
he
was
discharged
from
the
force
emil
confession
six
years
later
cleared
the
unfortunate
policeman
of
disgrace
and
he
is
alive
and
in
good
health
the
recipient
of
a
handsome
pension
from
the
city
emil
gluck
having
disposed
of
his
immediate
enemies
now
sought
a
wider
field
though
his
enmity
for
newspaper
men
and
for
the
police
remained
always
active
the
royalties
on
his
ignition
device
for
had
mounted
up
while
he
lay
in
prison
and
year
by
year
the
earning
power
of
his
invention
increased
he
was
independent
able
to
travel
wherever
he
willed
over
the
earth
and
to
glut
his
monstrous
appetite
for
revenge
he
had
become
a
monomaniac
and
an
a
philosophic
anarchist
merely
but
a
violent
anarchist
perhaps
the
word
is
misused
and
he
is
better
described
as
a
nihilist
or
an
annihilist
it
is
known
that
he
affiliated
with
none
of
the
groups
of
terrorists
he
operated
wholly
alone
but
he
created
a
thousandfold
more
terror
and
achieved
a
thousandfold
more
destruction
than
all
the
terrorist
groups
added
together
he
signalized
his
departure
from
california
by
blowing
up
fort
mason
in
his
confession
he
spoke
of
it
as
a
little
was
merely
trying
his
hand
for
eight
years
he
wandered
over
the
earth
a
mysterious
terror
destroying
property
to
the
tune
of
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
and
destroying
countless
lives
one
good
result
of
his
awful
deeds
was
the
destruction
he
wrought
among
the
terrorists
themselves
every
time
he
did
anything
the
terrorists
in
the
vicinity
were
gathered
in
by
the
police
dragnet
and
many
of
them
were
executed
seventeen
were
executed
at
rome
alone
following
the
assassination
of
the
italian
king
perhaps
the
most
achievement
of
his
was
the
assassination
of
the
king
and
queen
of
portugal
it
was
their
wedding
day
all
possible
precautions
had
been
taken
against
the
terrorists
and
the
way
from
the
cathedral
through
streets
was
with
troops
while
a
squad
of
two
hundred
mounted
troopers
surrounded
the
carriage
suddenly
the
amazing
thing
happened
the
automatic
rifles
of
the
troopers
began
to
go
off
as
well
as
the
rifles
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
infantry
in
the
excitement
the
muzzles
of
the
exploding
rifles
were
turned
in
all
directions
the
slaughter
was
troops
spectators
and
the
king
and
queen
were
riddled
with
bullets
to
complicate
the
affair
in
different
parts
of
the
crowd
behind
the
two
terrorists
had
bombs
explode
on
their
persons
these
bombs
they
had
intended
to
throw
if
they
got
the
opportunity
but
who
was
to
know
this
the
frightful
havoc
wrought
by
the
bursting
bombs
but
added
to
the
confusion
it
was
considered
part
of
the
general
attack
one
puzzling
thing
that
could
not
be
explained
away
was
the
conduct
of
the
troopers
with
their
exploding
rifles
it
seemed
impossible
that
they
should
be
in
the
plot
yet
there
were
the
hundreds
their
flying
bullets
had
slain
including
the
king
and
queen
on
the
other
hand
more
baffling
than
ever
was
the
fact
that
seventy
per
cent
of
the
troopers
themselves
had
been
killed
or
wounded
some
explained
this
on
the
ground
that
the
loyal
witnessing
the
attack
on
the
royal
carriage
had
opened
fire
on
the
traitors
yet
not
one
bit
of
evidence
to
verify
this
could
be
drawn
from
the
survivors
though
many
were
put
to
the
torture
they
contended
stubbornly
that
they
had
not
discharged
their
rifles
at
all
but
that
their
rifles
had
discharged
themselves
they
were
laughed
at
by
the
chemists
who
held
that
while
it
was
just
barely
probable
that
a
single
cartridge
charged
with
the
new
smokeless
powder
might
spontaneously
explode
it
was
beyond
all
probability
and
possibility
for
all
the
cartridges
in
a
given
area
so
charged
spontaneously
to
explode
and
so
in
the
end
no
explanation
of
the
amazing
occurrence
was
reached
the
general
opinion
of
the
rest
of
the
world
was
that
the
whole
affair
was
a
blind
panic
of
the
feverish
latins
precipitated
it
was
true
by
the
bursting
of
two
terrorist
bombs
and
in
this
connection
was
recalled
the
laughable
encounter
of
long
years
before
between
the
russian
fleet
and
the
english
fishing
boats
and
emil
gluck
chuckled
and
went
his
way
he
knew
but
how
was
the
world
to
know
he
had
stumbled
upon
the
secret
in
his
old
electroplating
shop
on
telegraph
avenue
in
the
city
of
oakland
it
happened
at
that
time
that
a
wireless
telegraph
station
was
established
by
the
thurston
power
company
close
to
his
shop
in
a
short
time
his
electroplating
vat
was
put
out
of
order
the
had
many
bad
joints
and
on
investigation
gluck
discovered
minute
welds
at
the
joints
in
the
wiring
these
by
lowering
the
resistance
had
caused
an
excessive
current
to
pass
through
the
solution
it
and
spoiling
the
work
but
what
had
caused
the
welds
was
the
question
in
mind
his
reasoning
was
simple
before
the
establishment
of
the
wireless
station
the
vat
had
worked
well
not
until
after
the
establishment
of
the
wireless
station
had
the
vat
been
ruined
therefore
the
wireless
station
had
been
the
cause
but
how
he
quickly
answered
the
question
if
an
electric
discharge
was
capable
of
operating
a
coherer
across
three
thousand
miles
of
ocean
then
certainly
the
electric
discharges
from
the
wireless
station
four
hundred
feet
away
could
produce
coherer
effects
on
the
bad
joints
in
the
gluck
thought
no
more
about
it
at
the
time
he
merely
his
vat
and
went
on
electroplating
but
afterwards
in
prison
he
remembered
the
incident
and
like
a
flash
there
came
into
his
mind
the
full
significance
of
it
he
saw
in
it
the
silent
secret
weapon
with
which
to
revenge
himself
on
the
world
his
great
discovery
which
died
with
him
was
control
over
the
direction
and
scope
of
the
electric
discharge
at
the
time
this
was
the
unsolved
problem
of
wireless
it
still
is
emil
gluck
in
his
prison
cell
mastered
it
and
when
he
was
released
he
applied
it
it
was
fairly
simple
given
the
directing
power
that
was
his
to
introduce
a
spark
into
the
of
a
fort
a
battleship
or
a
revolver
and
not
alone
could
he
thus
explode
powder
at
a
distance
but
he
could
ignite
conflagrations
the
great
boston
fire
was
started
by
by
accident
however
as
he
stated
in
his
confession
adding
that
it
was
a
pleasing
accident
and
that
he
had
never
had
any
reason
to
regret
it
it
was
emil
gluck
that
caused
the
terrible
war
with
the
loss
of
lives
and
the
consumption
of
almost
incalculable
treasure
it
will
be
remembered
that
in
because
of
the
pickard
incident
strained
relations
existed
between
the
two
countries
germany
though
aggrieved
was
not
anxious
for
war
and
as
a
peace
token
sent
the
crown
prince
and
seven
battleships
on
a
friendly
visit
to
the
united
states
on
the
night
of
february
the
seven
warships
lay
at
anchor
in
the
hudson
opposite
new
york
city
and
on
that
night
emil
gluck
alone
with
all
his
apparatus
on
board
was
out
in
a
launch
this
launch
it
was
afterwards
proved
was
bought
by
him
from
the
ross
turner
company
while
much
of
the
apparatus
he
used
that
night
had
been
purchased
from
the
columbia
electric
works
but
this
was
not
known
at
the
time
all
that
was
known
was
that
the
seven
battleships
blew
up
one
after
another
at
regular
intervals
ninety
per
cent
of
the
crews
and
officers
along
with
the
crown
prince
perished
many
years
before
the
american
battleship
had
been
blown
up
in
the
harbour
of
havana
and
war
with
spain
had
immediately
there
has
always
existed
a
reasonable
doubt
as
to
whether
the
explosion
was
due
to
conspiracy
or
accident
but
accident
could
not
explain
the
blowing
up
of
the
seven
battleships
on
the
hudson
at
intervals
germany
believed
that
it
had
been
done
by
a
submarine
and
immediately
declared
war
it
was
six
months
after
confession
that
she
returned
the
philippines
and
hawaii
to
the
united
states
in
the
meanwhile
emil
gluck
the
malevolent
wizard
and
travelled
his
whirlwind
path
of
destruction
he
left
no
traces
scientifically
thorough
he
always
cleaned
up
after
himself
his
method
was
to
rent
a
room
or
a
house
and
secretly
to
install
his
apparatus
by
the
way
he
so
perfected
and
simplified
that
it
occupied
little
space
after
he
had
accomplished
his
purpose
he
carefully
removed
the
apparatus
he
bade
fair
to
live
out
a
long
life
of
horrible
crime
the
epidemic
of
shooting
of
new
york
city
policemen
was
a
remarkable
affair
it
became
one
of
the
horror
mysteries
of
the
time
in
two
short
weeks
over
a
hundred
policemen
were
shot
in
the
legs
by
their
own
revolvers
inspector
jones
did
not
solve
the
mystery
but
it
was
his
idea
that
finally
outwitted
gluck
on
his
recommendation
the
policemen
ceased
carrying
revolvers
and
no
more
accidental
shootings
occurred
it
was
in
the
early
spring
of
that
gluck
destroyed
the
mare
island
from
a
room
in
vallejo
he
sent
his
electric
discharges
across
the
vallejo
straits
to
mare
island
he
first
played
his
flashes
on
the
battleship
she
lay
at
the
dock
of
one
of
the
on
her
forward
deck
on
a
huge
temporary
platform
of
timbers
were
disposed
over
a
hundred
mines
these
mines
were
for
the
defence
of
the
golden
gate
any
one
of
these
mines
was
capable
of
destroying
a
dozen
battleships
and
there
were
over
a
hundred
mines
the
destruction
was
terrific
but
it
was
only
overture
he
played
his
flashes
down
the
mare
island
shore
blowing
up
five
torpedo
boats
the
torpedo
station
and
the
great
magazine
at
the
eastern
end
of
the
island
returning
westward
again
and
scooping
in
occasional
isolated
magazines
on
the
high
ground
back
from
the
shore
he
blew
up
three
cruisers
and
the
battleships
and
latter
had
just
gone
into
and
the
magnificent
was
destroyed
along
with
her
it
was
a
frightful
catastrophe
and
a
shiver
of
horror
passed
through
the
land
but
it
was
nothing
to
what
was
to
follow
in
the
late
fall
of
that
year
emil
gluck
made
a
clean
sweep
of
the
atlantic
seaboard
from
maine
to
florida
nothing
escaped
forts
mines
coast
defences
of
all
sorts
torpedo
stations
went
up
three
months
afterward
in
midwinter
he
smote
the
north
shore
of
the
mediterranean
from
gibraltar
to
greece
in
the
same
stupefying
manner
a
wail
went
up
from
the
nations
it
was
clear
that
human
agency
was
behind
all
this
destruction
and
it
was
equally
clear
through
emil
impartiality
that
the
destruction
was
not
the
work
of
any
particular
nation
one
thing
was
patent
namely
that
whoever
was
the
human
behind
it
all
that
human
was
a
menace
to
the
world
no
nation
was
safe
there
was
no
defence
against
this
unknown
and
foe
warfare
was
not
merely
futile
but
itself
the
very
essence
of
the
peril
for
a
the
manufacture
of
powder
ceased
and
all
soldiers
and
sailors
were
withdrawn
from
all
fortifications
and
war
vessels
and
even
a
was
seriously
considered
at
the
convention
of
the
powers
held
at
the
hague
at
that
time
and
then
silas
bannerman
a
secret
service
agent
of
the
united
states
leaped
into
by
arresting
emil
gluck
at
first
bannerman
was
laughed
at
but
he
had
prepared
his
case
well
and
in
a
few
weeks
the
most
sceptical
were
convinced
of
emil
guilt
the
one
thing
however
that
silas
bannerman
never
succeeded
in
explaining
even
to
his
own
satisfaction
was
how
first
he
came
to
connect
gluck
with
the
atrocious
crimes
it
is
true
bannerman
was
in
vallejo
on
secret
government
business
at
the
time
of
the
destruction
of
mare
island
and
it
is
true
that
on
the
streets
of
vallejo
emil
gluck
was
pointed
out
to
him
as
a
queer
crank
but
no
impression
was
made
at
the
time
it
was
not
until
afterward
when
on
a
vacation
in
the
rocky
mountains
and
when
reading
the
first
published
reports
of
the
destruction
along
the
atlantic
coast
that
suddenly
bannerman
thought
of
emil
gluck
and
on
the
instant
there
flashed
into
his
mind
the
connection
between
gluck
and
the
destruction
it
was
only
an
hypothesis
but
it
was
sufficient
the
great
thing
was
the
conception
of
the
hypothesis
in
itself
an
act
of
unconscious
thing
as
unaccountable
as
the
flashing
for
instance
into
mind
of
the
principle
of
gravitation
the
rest
was
easy
where
was
gluck
at
the
time
of
the
destruction
along
the
atlantic
was
the
question
that
formed
in
mind
by
his
own
request
he
was
put
upon
the
case
in
no
time
he
ascertained
that
gluck
had
himself
been
up
and
down
the
atlantic
coast
in
the
late
fall
of
also
he
ascertained
that
gluck
had
been
in
new
york
city
during
the
epidemic
of
the
shooting
of
police
officers
where
was
gluck
now
was
next
query
and
as
if
in
answer
came
the
wholesale
destruction
along
the
mediterranean
gluck
had
sailed
for
europe
a
month
knew
that
it
was
not
necessary
for
bannerman
to
go
to
europe
by
means
of
cable
messages
and
the
of
the
european
secret
services
he
traced
course
along
the
mediterranean
and
found
that
in
every
instance
it
coincided
with
the
blowing
up
of
coast
defences
and
ships
also
he
learned
that
gluck
had
just
sailed
on
the
green
star
liner
for
the
united
states
the
case
was
complete
in
mind
though
in
the
interval
of
waiting
he
worked
up
the
details
in
this
he
was
ably
assisted
by
george
brown
an
operator
employed
by
the
system
of
wireless
telegraphy
when
the
arrived
off
sandy
hook
she
was
boarded
by
bannerman
from
a
government
tug
and
emil
gluck
was
made
a
prisoner
the
trial
and
the
confession
followed
in
the
confession
gluck
professed
regret
only
for
one
thing
namely
that
he
had
taken
his
time
as
he
said
had
he
dreamed
that
he
was
ever
to
be
discovered
he
would
have
worked
more
rapidly
and
accomplished
a
thousand
times
the
destruction
he
did
his
secret
died
with
him
though
it
is
now
known
that
the
french
government
managed
to
get
access
to
him
and
offered
him
a
billion
francs
for
his
invention
wherewith
he
was
able
to
direct
and
closely
to
confine
electric
discharges
was
sell
to
you
that
which
would
enable
you
to
enslave
and
maltreat
suffering
humanity
and
though
the
war
departments
of
the
nations
have
continued
to
experiment
in
their
secret
laboratories
they
have
so
far
failed
to
light
upon
the
slightest
trace
of
the
secret
emil
gluck
was
executed
on
december
and
so
died
at
the
age
of
one
of
the
most
unfortunate
geniuses
a
man
of
tremendous
intellect
but
whose
mighty
powers
instead
of
making
toward
good
were
so
twisted
and
warped
that
he
became
the
most
amazing
of
criminals
from
of
crime
by
kind
permission
of
the
publishers
holiday
and
whitsund
the
dream
of
debs
i
awoke
fully
an
hour
before
my
customary
time
this
in
itself
was
remarkable
and
i
lay
very
wide
awake
pondering
over
it
something
was
the
matter
something
was
knew
not
what
i
was
oppressed
by
a
premonition
of
something
terrible
that
had
happened
or
was
about
to
happen
but
what
was
it
i
strove
to
orient
myself
i
remembered
that
at
the
time
of
the
great
earthquake
of
many
claimed
they
awakened
some
moments
before
the
first
shock
and
that
during
these
moments
they
experienced
strange
feelings
of
dread
was
san
francisco
again
to
be
visited
by
earthquake
i
lay
for
a
full
minute
numbly
expectant
but
there
occurred
no
reeling
of
walls
nor
shock
and
grind
of
falling
masonry
all
was
quiet
that
was
it
the
silence
no
wonder
i
had
been
perturbed
the
hum
of
the
great
live
city
was
strangely
absent
the
surface
cars
passed
along
my
street
at
that
time
of
day
on
an
average
of
one
every
three
minutes
but
in
the
ten
succeeding
minutes
not
a
car
passed
perhaps
it
was
a
strike
was
my
thought
or
perhaps
there
had
been
an
accident
and
the
power
was
shut
off
but
no
the
silence
was
too
profound
i
heard
no
jar
and
rattle
of
waggon
wheels
nor
stamp
of
hoofs
straining
up
the
steep
pressing
the
beside
my
bed
i
strove
to
hear
the
sound
of
the
bell
though
i
well
knew
it
was
impossible
for
the
sound
to
rise
three
stories
to
me
even
if
the
bell
did
ring
it
rang
all
right
for
a
few
minutes
later
brown
entered
with
the
tray
and
morning
paper
though
his
features
were
impassive
as
ever
i
noted
a
startled
apprehensive
light
in
his
eyes
i
noted
also
that
there
was
no
cream
on
the
tray
creamery
did
not
deliver
this
morning
he
explained
did
the
i
glanced
again
at
the
tray
there
were
no
fresh
french
slices
of
stale
graham
bread
from
yesterday
the
most
detestable
of
bread
so
far
as
i
was
concerned
was
delivered
this
morning
sir
brown
started
to
explain
apologetically
but
i
interrupted
him
paper
sir
it
was
delivered
but
it
was
the
only
thing
and
it
is
the
last
time
too
there
be
any
paper
the
paper
says
so
can
i
send
out
and
get
you
some
condensed
milk
i
shook
my
head
accepted
the
coffee
black
and
spread
open
the
paper
the
headlines
explained
too
much
in
fact
for
the
lengths
of
pessimism
to
which
the
journal
went
were
ridiculous
a
general
strike
it
said
had
been
called
all
over
the
united
states
and
most
foreboding
anxieties
were
expressed
concerning
the
provisioning
of
the
great
cities
i
read
on
hastily
skimming
much
and
remembering
much
of
labour
troubles
in
the
past
for
a
generation
the
general
strike
had
been
the
dream
of
organized
labour
which
dream
had
arisen
originally
in
the
mind
of
debs
one
of
the
great
labour
leaders
of
thirty
years
before
i
recollected
that
in
my
young
days
i
had
even
written
an
article
on
the
subject
for
one
of
the
magazines
and
that
i
had
entitled
it
dream
of
and
i
must
confess
that
i
had
treated
the
idea
very
cavalierly
and
academically
as
a
dream
and
nothing
more
time
and
the
world
had
rolled
on
gompers
was
gone
the
american
federation
of
labour
was
gone
and
gone
was
debs
with
all
his
wild
revolutionary
ideas
but
the
dream
had
persisted
and
here
it
was
at
last
realized
in
fact
but
i
laughed
as
i
read
at
the
gloomy
outlook
i
knew
better
i
had
seen
organized
labour
worsted
in
too
many
conflicts
it
would
be
a
matter
only
of
days
when
the
thing
would
be
settled
this
was
a
national
strike
and
it
take
the
government
long
to
break
it
i
threw
the
paper
down
and
proceeded
to
dress
it
would
certainly
be
interesting
to
be
out
in
the
streets
of
san
francisco
when
not
a
wheel
was
turning
and
the
whole
city
was
taking
an
enforced
vacation
beg
your
pardon
sir
brown
said
as
he
handed
me
my
harmmed
has
asked
to
see
you
before
you
go
him
in
right
away
i
answered
harmmed
was
the
butler
when
he
entered
i
could
see
he
was
labouring
under
controlled
excitement
he
came
at
once
to
the
point
shall
i
do
sir
there
will
be
needed
provisions
and
the
delivery
drivers
are
on
strike
and
the
electricity
is
shut
guess
on
strike
the
shops
open
i
asked
the
small
ones
sir
the
retail
clerks
are
out
and
the
big
ones
open
but
the
owners
and
their
families
are
running
the
little
ones
take
the
machine
i
said
go
the
rounds
and
make
your
purchases
buy
plenty
of
everything
you
need
or
may
need
get
a
box
of
get
boxes
and
when
done
tell
harrison
to
bring
the
machine
around
to
the
club
for
later
than
harmmed
shook
his
head
gravely
harrison
has
struck
along
with
the
union
and
i
know
how
to
run
the
machine
ho
he
has
has
he
said
i
when
next
mister
harrison
happens
around
you
tell
him
that
he
can
look
elsewhere
for
a
happen
to
belong
to
a
union
do
you
harmmed
sir
was
the
answer
even
if
i
did
not
desert
my
employer
in
a
crisis
like
this
no
sir
i
right
thank
you
i
said
you
get
ready
to
accompany
me
run
the
machine
myself
and
lay
in
a
stock
of
provisions
to
stand
a
it
was
a
beautiful
first
of
may
even
as
may
days
go
the
sky
was
cloudless
there
was
no
wind
and
the
air
was
balmy
many
autos
were
out
but
the
owners
were
driving
them
themselves
the
streets
were
crowded
but
quiet
the
working
class
dressed
in
its
sunday
best
was
out
taking
the
air
and
observing
the
effects
of
the
strike
it
was
all
so
unusual
and
withal
so
peaceful
that
i
found
myself
enjoying
it
my
nerves
were
tingling
with
mild
excitement
it
was
a
sort
of
placid
adventure
i
passed
miss
chickering
she
was
at
the
helm
of
her
little
runabout
she
swung
around
and
came
after
me
catching
me
at
the
corner
corf
she
hailed
you
know
where
i
can
buy
candles
been
to
a
dozen
shops
and
all
sold
out
dreadfully
awful
it
but
her
sparkling
eyes
gave
the
lie
to
her
words
like
the
rest
of
us
she
was
enjoying
it
hugely
quite
an
adventure
it
was
getting
those
candles
it
was
not
until
we
went
across
the
city
and
down
into
the
quarter
south
of
market
street
that
we
found
small
corner
groceries
that
had
not
yet
sold
out
miss
chickering
thought
one
box
was
sufficient
but
i
persuaded
her
into
taking
four
my
car
was
large
and
i
laid
in
a
dozen
boxes
there
was
no
telling
what
delays
might
arise
in
the
settlement
of
the
strike
also
i
filled
the
car
with
sacks
of
flour
tinned
goods
and
all
the
ordinary
necessaries
of
life
suggested
by
harmmed
who
fussed
around
and
clucked
over
the
purchases
like
an
anxious
old
hen
the
remarkable
thing
that
first
day
of
the
strike
was
that
no
one
really
apprehended
anything
serious
the
announcement
of
organized
labour
in
the
morning
papers
that
it
was
prepared
to
stay
out
a
month
or
three
months
was
laughed
at
and
yet
that
very
first
day
we
might
have
guessed
as
much
from
the
fact
that
the
working
class
took
practically
no
part
in
the
great
rush
to
buy
provisions
of
course
not
for
weeks
and
months
craftily
and
secretly
the
whole
working
class
had
been
laying
in
private
stocks
of
provisions
that
was
why
we
were
permitted
to
go
down
and
buy
out
the
little
groceries
in
the
neighbourhoods
it
was
not
until
i
arrived
at
the
club
that
afternoon
that
i
began
to
feel
the
first
alarm
everything
was
in
confusion
there
were
no
olives
for
the
cocktails
and
the
service
was
by
hitches
and
jerks
most
of
the
men
were
angry
and
all
were
worried
a
babel
of
voices
greeted
me
as
i
entered
general
folsom
nursing
his
capacious
paunch
in
a
in
the
was
defending
himself
against
excited
gentlemen
who
were
demanding
that
he
should
do
something
can
i
do
more
than
i
have
done
he
was
saying
are
no
orders
from
washington
if
you
gentlemen
will
get
a
wire
through
do
anything
i
am
commanded
to
do
but
i
see
what
can
be
done
the
first
thing
i
did
this
morning
as
soon
as
i
learned
of
the
strike
was
to
order
in
the
troops
from
the
thousand
of
them
guarding
the
banks
the
mint
the
post
office
and
all
the
public
buildings
there
is
no
disorder
whatever
the
strikers
are
keeping
the
peace
perfectly
you
expect
me
to
shoot
them
down
as
they
walk
along
the
streets
with
wives
and
children
all
in
their
best
bib
and
like
to
know
happening
on
wall
street
i
heard
jimmy
wombold
say
as
i
passed
along
i
could
imagine
his
anxiety
for
i
knew
that
he
was
deep
in
the
big
deal
corf
atkinson
bustled
up
to
me
your
machine
running
i
answered
the
matter
with
your
own
down
and
the
garages
are
all
closed
and
my
somewhere
around

i
think

on
the
overland

a
wire

love
or
money

evening

moment

for
the
crew

members
of
the
coast
union
and
on
strike
along
with
the
my
wife
may
be
starving
i
could
hear
atkinson
wailing
as
i
moved
on
at
the
other
end
of
the
i
ran
into
a
group
of
men
bunched
excitedly
and
angrily
around
bertie
messener
and
bertie
was
stirring
them
up
and
prodding
them
in
his
cool
cynical
way
bertie
care
about
the
strike
he
care
much
about
anything
he
was
least
in
all
the
clean
things
of
life
the
nasty
things
had
no
attraction
for
him
he
was
worth
twenty
millions
all
of
it
in
safe
investments
and
he
had
never
done
a
tap
of
productive
work
in
his
it
all
from
his
father
and
two
uncles
he
had
been
everywhere
seen
everything
and
done
everything
but
get
married
and
this
last
in
the
face
of
the
grim
and
determined
attack
of
a
few
hundred
ambitious
mammas
for
years
he
had
been
the
greatest
catch
and
as
yet
he
had
avoided
being
caught
he
was
disgracefully
eligible
on
top
of
his
wealth
he
was
young
handsome
and
as
i
said
before
clean
he
was
a
great
athlete
a
young
blond
god
that
did
everything
perfectly
and
admirably
with
the
solitary
exception
of
matrimony
and
he
care
about
anything
had
no
ambitions
no
passions
no
desire
to
do
the
very
things
he
did
so
much
better
than
other
men
is
sedition
one
man
in
the
group
was
crying
another
called
it
revolt
and
revolution
and
another
called
it
anarchy
see
it
bertie
said
have
been
out
in
the
streets
all
morning
perfect
order
reigns
i
never
saw
a
more
populace
no
use
calling
it
names
not
any
of
those
things
just
what
it
claims
to
be
a
general
strike
and
your
turn
to
play
play
all
right
cried
garfield
one
of
the
traction
millionaires

this
dirt
where
its
place
beasts

till
the
government
takes
a
where
is
the
government
bertie
interposed
might
as
well
be
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
so
far
as
concerned
you
know
happening
at
washington
you
know
whether
got
a
government
or
you
worry
about
that
garfield
blurted
out
assure
you
not
worrying
bertie
smiled
languidly
it
seems
to
me
what
you
fellows
are
doing
look
in
the
glass
garfield
did
not
look
but
had
he
looked
he
would
have
seen
a
very
excited
gentleman
with
rumpled
hair
a
flushed
face
mouth
sullen
and
vindictive
and
eyes
wildly
gleaming
not
right
i
tell
you
little
hanover
said
and
from
his
tone
i
was
sure
that
he
had
already
said
it
a
number
of
times
going
too
far
hanover
bertie
replied
fellows
make
me
tired
all
men
eroded
my
eardrums
with
your
endless
gabble
for
the
open
shop
and
the
right
of
a
man
to
work
harangued
along
those
lines
for
years
labour
is
doing
nothing
wrong
in
going
out
on
this
general
strike
it
is
violating
no
law
of
god
nor
man
you
talk
hanover
been
ringing
the
changes
too
long
on
the
right
to
work
or
not
to
work
you
escape
the
corollary
a
dirty
little
sordid
scrap
all
the
whole
thing
is
got
labour
down
and
gouged
it
and
now
got
you
down
and
is
gouging
you
all
and
every
man
in
the
group
broke
out
in
indignant
denials
that
labour
had
ever
been
gouged
sir
garfield
was
shouting
done
the
best
for
labour
instead
of
gouging
it
given
it
a
chance
to
live
made
work
for
it
where
would
labour
be
if
it
been
for
us
whole
lot
better
off
bertie
sneered
got
labour
down
and
gouged
it
every
time
you
got
a
chance
and
you
went
out
of
your
way
to
make
no
were
the
cries
was
the
strike
right
here
in
san
francisco
bertie
went
on
imperturbably
association
precipitated
that
strike
you
know
that
and
you
know
i
know
it
too
for
sat
in
these
very
rooms
and
heard
the
inside
talk
and
news
of
the
fight
first
you
precipitated
the
strike
then
you
bought
the
mayor
and
the
chief
of
police
and
broke
the
strike
a
pretty
spectacle
you
philanthropists
getting
the
teamsters
down
and
gouging
them
on
not
through
with
you
only
last
year
that
the
labour
ticket
of
colorado
elected
a
governor
he
was
never
seated
you
know
why
you
know
how
your
brother
philanthropists
and
capitalists
of
colorado
worked
it
it
was
a
case
of
getting
labour
down
and
gouging
it
you
kept
the
president
of
the
amalgamated
association
of
miners
in
jail
for
three
years
on
murder
charges
and
with
him
out
of
the
way
you
broke
up
the
association
that
was
gouging
labour
admit
the
third
time
the
graduated
income
tax
was
declared
unconstitutional
was
a
gouge
so
was
the
bill
you
killed
in
the
last
congress
of
all
unmitigated
immoral
gouges
your
destruction
of
the
principle
was
the
limit
you
know
how
it
was
done
you
bought
out
farburg
the
last
president
of
the
old
american
federation
of
labour
he
was
your
the
creature
of
all
the
trusts
and
associations
which
is
the
same
thing
you
precipitated
the
big
strike
farburg
betrayed
that
strike
you
won
and
the
old
american
federation
of
labour
crumbled
to
pieces
you
fellows
destroyed
it
and
by
so
doing
undid
yourselves
for
right
on
top
of
it
began
the
organization
of
the
biggest
and
solidest
organization
of
labour
the
united
states
has
ever
seen
and
you
are
responsible
for
its
existence
and
for
the
present
general
strike
you
smashed
all
the
old
federations
and
drove
labour
into
the
and
the
called
the
general
fighting
for
the
closed
shop
and
then
you
have
the
effrontery
to
stand
here
face
to
face
and
tell
me
that
you
never
got
labour
down
and
gouged
it
bah
this
time
there
were
no
denials
garfield
broke
out
in
done
nothing
we
were
not
compelled
to
do
if
we
were
to
not
saying
anything
about
that
bertie
answered
i
am
complaining
about
is
your
squealing
now
that
getting
a
taste
of
your
own
medicine
how
many
strikes
have
you
won
by
starving
labour
into
submission
well
worked
out
a
scheme
whereby
to
starve
you
into
submission
it
wants
the
closed
shop
and
if
it
can
get
it
by
starving
you
why
starve
you
notice
that
you
have
profited
in
the
past
by
those
very
labour
gouges
you
mention
insinuated
brentwood
one
of
the
wiliest
and
most
astute
of
our
corporation
lawyers
receiver
is
as
bad
as
the
thief
he
sneered
had
no
hand
in
the
gouging
but
you
took
your
whack
out
of
the
is
quite
beside
the
question
brentwood
bertie
drawled
as
bad
as
hanover
intruding
the
moral
element
i
said
that
anything
is
right
or
wrong
all
a
rotten
game
i
know
and
my
sole
kick
is
that
you
fellows
are
squealing
now
that
down
and
taking
a
gouge
out
of
you
of
course
taken
the
profits
from
the
gouging
and
thanks
to
you
gentlemen
without
having
personally
to
do
the
dirty
work
you
did
that
for
believe
me
not
because
i
am
more
virtuous
than
you
but
because
my
good
father
and
his
various
brothers
left
me
a
lot
of
money
with
which
to
pay
for
the
dirty
you
mean
to
brentwood
began
hotly
on
get
up
bertie
interposed
insolently
no
use
in
playing
hypocrites
in
this
den
the
high
and
lofty
is
all
right
for
the
newspapers
clubs
and
sunday
part
of
the
game
but
for
sake
play
it
on
one
another
you
know
and
you
know
that
i
know
just
what
jobbery
was
done
in
the
building
strike
last
fall
who
put
up
the
money
who
did
the
work
and
who
profited
by
brentwood
flushed
darkly
we
are
all
tarred
with
the
same
brush
and
the
best
thing
for
us
to
do
is
to
leave
morality
out
of
it
again
i
repeat
play
the
game
play
it
to
the
last
finish
but
for
sake
squeal
when
you
get
when
i
left
the
group
bertie
was
off
on
a
new
tack
tormenting
them
with
the
more
serious
aspects
of
the
situation
pointing
out
the
shortage
of
supplies
that
was
already
making
itself
felt
and
asking
them
what
they
were
going
to
do
about
it
a
little
later
i
met
him
in
the
leaving
and
gave
him
a
lift
home
in
my
machine
a
great
stroke
this
general
strike
he
said
as
we
bowled
along
through
the
crowded
but
orderly
streets
a
smashing
labour
caught
us
napping
and
struck
at
our
weakest
place
the
stomach
going
to
get
out
of
san
francisco
corf
take
my
advice
and
get
out
too
head
for
the
country
anywhere
have
more
chance
buy
up
a
stock
of
supplies
and
get
into
a
tent
or
a
cabin
somewhere
soon
be
nothing
but
starvation
in
this
city
for
such
as
how
correct
bertie
messener
was
i
never
dreamed
i
decided
that
he
was
an
alarmist
as
for
myself
i
was
content
to
remain
and
watch
the
fun
after
i
dropped
him
instead
of
going
directly
home
i
went
on
in
a
hunt
for
more
food
to
my
surprise
i
learned
that
the
small
groceries
where
i
had
bought
in
the
morning
were
sold
out
i
extended
my
search
to
the
potrero
and
by
good
luck
managed
to
pick
up
another
box
of
candles
two
sacks
of
wheat
flour
ten
pounds
of
graham
flour
which
would
do
for
the
servants
a
case
of
tinned
corn
and
two
cases
of
tinned
tomatoes
it
did
look
as
though
there
was
going
to
be
at
least
a
temporary
food
shortage
and
i
hugged
myself
over
the
goodly
stock
of
provisions
i
had
laid
in
the
next
morning
i
had
my
coffee
in
bed
as
usual
and
more
than
the
cream
i
missed
the
daily
paper
it
was
this
absence
of
knowledge
of
what
was
going
on
in
the
world
that
i
found
the
chief
hardship
down
at
the
club
there
was
little
news
rider
had
crossed
from
oakland
in
his
launch
and
halstead
had
been
down
to
san
jose
and
back
in
his
machine
they
reported
the
same
conditions
in
those
places
as
in
san
francisco
everything
was
tied
up
by
the
strike
all
grocery
stocks
had
been
bought
out
by
the
upper
classes
and
perfect
order
reigned
but
what
was
happening
over
the
rest
of
the
chicago
new
york
washington
most
probably
the
same
things
that
were
happening
with
us
we
concluded
but
the
fact
that
we
did
not
know
with
absolute
surety
was
irritating
general
folsom
had
a
bit
of
news
an
attempt
had
been
made
to
place
army
telegraphers
in
the
telegraph
offices
but
the
wires
had
been
cut
in
every
direction
this
was
so
far
the
one
unlawful
act
committed
by
labour
and
that
it
was
a
concerted
act
he
was
fully
convinced
he
had
communicated
by
wireless
with
the
army
post
at
benicia
the
telegraph
lines
were
even
then
being
patrolled
by
soldiers
all
the
way
to
sacramento
once
for
one
short
instant
they
had
got
the
sacramento
call
then
the
wires
somewhere
were
cut
again
general
folsom
reasoned
that
similar
attempts
to
open
communication
were
being
made
by
the
authorities
all
the
way
across
the
continent
but
he
was
as
to
whether
or
not
he
thought
the
attempt
would
succeed
what
worried
him
was
the
he
could
not
but
believe
that
it
was
an
important
part
of
the
labour
conspiracy
also
he
regretted
that
the
government
had
not
long
since
established
its
projected
chain
of
wireless
stations
the
days
came
and
went
and
for
a
while
it
was
a
humdrum
time
nothing
happened
the
edge
of
excitement
had
become
blunted
the
streets
were
not
so
crowded
the
working
class
did
not
come
uptown
any
more
to
see
how
we
were
taking
the
strike
and
there
were
not
so
many
automobiles
running
around
the
and
garages
were
closed
and
whenever
a
machine
broke
down
it
went
out
of
commission
the
clutch
on
mine
broke
and
neither
love
nor
money
could
get
it
repaired
like
the
rest
i
was
now
walking
san
francisco
lay
dead
and
we
did
not
know
what
was
happening
over
the
rest
of
the
country
but
from
the
very
fact
that
we
did
not
know
we
could
conclude
only
that
the
rest
of
the
country
lay
as
dead
as
san
francisco
from
time
to
time
the
city
was
placarded
with
the
proclamations
of
organized
had
been
printed
months
before
and
evidenced
how
thoroughly
the
had
prepared
for
the
strike
every
detail
had
been
worked
out
long
in
advance
no
violence
had
occurred
as
yet
with
the
exception
of
the
shooting
of
a
few
by
the
soldiers
but
the
people
of
the
slums
were
starving
and
growing
ominously
restless
the
business
men
the
millionaires
and
the
professional
class
held
meetings
and
passed
resolutions
but
there
was
no
way
of
making
the
proclamations
public
they
could
not
even
get
them
printed
one
result
of
these
meetings
however
was
that
general
folsom
was
persuaded
into
taking
military
possession
of
the
wholesale
houses
and
of
all
the
flour
grain
and
food
warehouses
it
was
high
time
for
suffering
was
becoming
acute
in
the
homes
of
the
rich
and
were
necessary
i
knew
that
my
servants
were
beginning
to
draw
long
faces
and
it
was
hole
they
made
in
my
stock
of
provisions
in
fact
as
i
afterward
surmised
each
servant
was
stealing
from
me
and
secreting
a
private
stock
of
provisions
for
himself
but
with
the
formation
of
the
came
new
troubles
there
was
only
so
much
of
a
food
reserve
in
san
francisco
and
at
the
best
it
could
not
last
long
organized
labour
we
knew
had
its
private
supplies
nevertheless
the
whole
working
class
joined
the
as
a
result
the
provisions
general
folsom
had
taken
possession
of
diminished
with
perilous
rapidity
how
were
the
soldiers
to
distinguish
between
a
shabby
man
a
member
of
the
or
a
slum
dweller
the
first
and
the
last
had
to
be
fed
but
the
soldiers
did
not
know
all
the
men
in
the
city
much
less
the
wives
and
sons
and
daughters
of
the
men
the
employers
helping
a
few
of
the
known
union
men
were
flung
out
of
the
but
that
amounted
to
nothing
to
make
matters
worse
the
government
tugs
that
had
been
hauling
food
from
the
army
depots
on
mare
island
to
angel
island
found
no
more
food
to
haul
the
soldiers
now
received
their
rations
from
the
confiscated
provisions
and
they
received
them
first
the
beginning
of
the
end
was
in
sight
violence
was
beginning
to
show
its
face
law
and
order
were
passing
away
and
passing
away
i
must
confess
among
the
slum
people
and
the
upper
classes
organized
labour
still
maintained
perfect
order
it
could
well
afford
had
plenty
to
eat
i
remember
the
afternoon
at
the
club
when
i
caught
halstead
and
brentwood
whispering
in
a
corner
they
took
me
in
on
the
venture
machine
was
still
in
running
order
and
they
were
going
out
halstead
had
a
long
butcher
knife
and
a
cleaver
we
went
out
to
the
outskirts
of
the
city
here
and
there
were
cows
grazing
but
always
they
were
guarded
by
their
owners
we
pursued
our
quest
following
along
the
fringe
of
the
city
to
the
east
and
on
the
hills
near
point
we
came
upon
a
cow
guarded
by
a
little
girl
there
was
also
a
young
calf
with
the
cow
we
wasted
no
time
on
preliminaries
the
little
girl
ran
away
screaming
while
we
slaughtered
the
cow
i
omit
the
details
for
they
are
not
were
unaccustomed
to
such
work
and
we
bungled
it
but
in
the
midst
of
it
working
with
the
haste
of
fear
we
heard
cries
and
we
saw
a
number
of
men
running
toward
us
we
abandoned
the
spoils
and
took
to
our
heels
to
our
surprise
we
were
not
pursued
looking
back
we
saw
the
men
hurriedly
cutting
up
the
cow
they
had
been
on
the
same
lay
as
ourselves
we
argued
that
there
was
plenty
for
all
and
ran
back
the
scene
that
followed
beggars
description
we
fought
and
squabbled
over
the
division
like
savages
brentwood
i
remember
was
a
perfect
brute
snarling
and
snapping
and
threatening
that
murder
would
be
done
if
we
did
not
get
our
proper
share
and
we
were
getting
our
share
when
there
occurred
a
new
irruption
on
the
scene
this
time
it
was
the
dreaded
peace
officers
of
the
the
little
girl
had
brought
them
they
were
armed
with
whips
and
clubs
and
there
were
a
score
of
them
the
little
girl
danced
up
and
down
in
anger
the
tears
streaming
down
her
cheeks
crying
it
to
give
it
to
that
guy
with
the
did
it
mash
his
face
for
him
mash
his
face
that
guy
with
the
specs
was
i
and
i
got
my
face
mashed
too
though
i
had
the
presence
of
mind
to
take
off
my
glasses
at
the
first
my
but
we
did
receive
a
trouncing
as
we
scattered
in
all
directions
brentwood
halstead
and
i
fled
away
for
the
machine
nose
was
bleeding
while
cheek
was
cut
across
with
the
scarlet
slash
of
a
whip
and
lo
when
the
pursuit
ceased
and
we
had
gained
the
machine
there
hiding
behind
it
was
the
frightened
calf
brentwood
warned
us
to
be
cautious
and
crept
up
on
it
like
a
wolf
or
tiger
knife
and
cleaver
had
been
left
behind
but
brentwood
still
had
his
hands
and
over
and
over
on
the
ground
he
rolled
with
the
poor
little
calf
as
he
throttled
it
we
threw
the
carcass
into
the
machine
covered
it
over
with
a
robe
and
started
for
home
but
our
misfortunes
had
only
begun
we
blew
out
a
tyre
there
was
no
way
of
fixing
it
and
twilight
was
coming
on
we
abandoned
the
machine
brentwood
pulling
and
staggering
along
in
advance
the
calf
covered
by
the
robe
slung
across
his
shoulders
we
took
turn
about
carrying
that
calf
and
it
nearly
killed
us
also
we
lost
our
way
and
then
after
hours
of
wandering
and
toil
we
encountered
a
gang
of
hoodlums
they
were
not
men
and
i
guess
they
were
as
hungry
as
we
at
any
rate
they
got
the
calf
and
we
got
the
thrashing
brentwood
raged
like
a
madman
the
rest
of
the
way
home
and
he
looked
like
one
with
his
torn
clothes
swollen
nose
and
blackened
eyes
there
any
more
after
that
general
folsom
sent
his
troopers
out
and
confiscated
all
the
cows
and
his
troopers
aided
by
the
militia
ate
most
of
the
meat
general
folsom
was
not
to
be
blamed
it
was
his
duty
to
maintain
law
and
order
and
he
maintained
it
by
means
of
the
soldiers
wherefore
he
was
compelled
to
feed
them
first
of
all
it
was
about
this
time
that
the
great
panic
occurred
the
wealthy
classes
precipitated
the
flight
and
then
the
slum
people
caught
the
contagion
and
stampeded
wildly
out
of
the
city
general
folsom
was
pleased
it
was
estimated
that
at
least
had
deserted
san
francisco
and
by
that
much
was
his
food
problem
solved
well
do
i
remember
that
day
in
the
morning
i
had
eaten
a
crust
of
bread
half
of
the
afternoon
i
had
stood
in
the
and
after
dark
i
returned
home
tired
and
miserable
carrying
a
quart
of
rice
and
a
slice
of
bacon
brown
met
me
at
the
door
his
face
was
worn
and
terrified
all
the
servants
had
fled
he
informed
me
he
alone
remained
i
was
touched
by
his
faithfulness
and
when
i
learned
that
he
had
eaten
nothing
all
day
i
divided
my
food
with
him
we
cooked
half
the
rice
and
half
the
bacon
sharing
it
equally
and
reserving
the
other
half
for
morning
i
went
to
bed
with
my
hunger
and
tossed
restlessly
all
night
in
the
morning
i
found
brown
had
deserted
me
and
greater
misfortune
still
he
had
stolen
what
remained
of
the
rice
and
bacon
it
was
a
gloomy
handful
of
men
that
came
together
at
the
club
that
morning
there
was
no
service
at
all
the
last
servant
was
gone
i
noticed
too
that
the
silver
was
gone
and
i
learned
where
it
had
gone
the
servants
had
not
taken
it
for
the
reason
i
presume
that
the
club
members
got
to
it
first
their
method
of
disposing
of
it
was
simple
down
south
of
market
street
in
the
dwellings
of
the
the
housewives
had
given
square
meals
in
exchange
for
it
i
went
back
to
my
house
yes
my
silver
was
but
a
massive
pitcher
this
i
wrapped
up
and
carried
down
south
of
market
street
i
felt
better
after
the
meal
and
returned
to
the
club
to
learn
if
there
was
anything
new
in
the
situation
hanover
collins
and
dakon
were
just
leaving
there
was
no
one
inside
they
told
me
and
they
invited
me
to
come
along
with
them
they
were
leaving
the
city
they
said
on
horses
and
there
was
a
spare
one
for
me
dakon
had
four
magnificent
carriage
horses
that
he
wanted
to
save
and
general
folsom
had
given
him
the
tip
that
next
morning
all
the
horses
that
remained
in
the
city
were
to
be
confiscated
for
food
there
were
not
many
horses
left
for
tens
of
thousands
of
them
had
been
turned
loose
into
the
country
when
the
hay
and
grain
gave
out
during
the
first
days
birdall
i
remember
who
had
great
draying
interests
had
turned
loose
three
hundred
dray
horses
at
an
average
value
of
five
hundred
dollars
this
had
amounted
to
he
had
hoped
at
first
to
recover
most
of
the
horses
after
the
strike
was
over
but
in
the
end
he
never
recovered
one
of
them
they
were
all
eaten
by
the
people
that
fled
from
san
francisco
for
that
matter
the
killing
of
the
army
mules
and
horses
for
food
had
already
begun
fortunately
for
dakon
he
had
had
a
plentiful
supply
of
hay
and
grain
stored
in
his
stable
we
managed
to
raise
four
saddles
and
we
found
the
animals
in
good
condition
and
spirited
withal
unused
to
being
ridden
i
remembered
the
san
francisco
of
the
great
earthquake
as
we
rode
through
the
streets
but
this
san
francisco
was
vastly
more
pitiable
no
cataclysm
of
nature
had
caused
this
but
rather
the
tyranny
of
the
labour
unions
we
rode
down
past
union
square
and
through
the
theatre
hotel
and
shopping
districts
the
streets
were
deserted
here
and
there
stood
automobiles
abandoned
where
they
had
broken
down
or
when
the
gasolene
had
given
out
there
was
no
sign
of
life
save
for
the
occasional
policemen
and
the
soldiers
guarding
the
banks
and
public
buildings
once
we
came
upon
an
man
pasting
up
the
latest
proclamation
we
stopped
to
read
have
maintained
an
orderly
strike
it
ran
we
shall
maintain
order
to
the
end
the
end
will
come
when
our
demands
are
satisfied
and
our
demands
will
be
satisfied
when
we
have
starved
our
employers
into
submission
as
we
ourselves
in
the
past
have
often
been
starved
into
very
words
collins
said
i
for
one
am
ready
to
submit
only
they
give
me
a
chance
to
submit
i
had
a
full
meal
in
an
age
i
wonder
what
tastes
like
we
stopped
to
read
another
proclamation
we
think
our
employers
are
ready
to
submit
we
shall
open
up
the
telegraphs
and
place
the
associations
of
the
united
states
in
communication
but
only
messages
relating
to
peace
terms
shall
be
permitted
over
the
we
rode
on
crossed
market
street
and
a
little
later
were
passing
through
the
district
here
the
streets
were
not
deserted
leaning
over
the
gates
or
standing
in
groups
were
the
men
happy
children
were
playing
games
and
stout
housewives
sat
on
the
front
steps
gossiping
one
and
all
cast
amused
glances
at
us
little
children
ran
after
us
crying
mister
you
hungry
and
one
woman
nursing
a
child
at
her
breast
called
to
dakon
fatty
give
you
a
meal
for
your
and
potatoes
currant
jelly
white
bread
canned
butter
and
two
cups
of
you
noticed
the
last
few
days
hanover
remarked
to
me
not
been
a
stray
dog
in
the
streets
i
had
noticed
but
i
had
not
thought
about
it
before
it
was
high
time
to
leave
the
unfortunate
city
we
at
last
managed
to
connect
with
the
san
bruno
road
along
which
we
headed
south
i
had
a
country
place
near
menlo
and
it
was
our
objective
but
soon
we
began
to
discover
that
the
country
was
worse
off
and
far
more
dangerous
than
the
city
there
the
soldiers
and
the
kept
order
but
the
country
had
been
turned
over
to
anarchy
two
hundred
thousand
people
had
fled
from
san
francisco
and
we
had
countless
evidences
that
their
flight
had
been
like
that
of
an
army
of
locusts
they
had
swept
everything
clean
there
had
been
robbery
and
fighting
here
and
there
we
passed
bodies
by
the
roadside
and
saw
the
blackened
ruins
of
the
fences
were
down
and
the
crops
had
been
trampled
by
the
feet
of
a
multitude
all
the
vegetable
patches
had
been
rooted
up
by
the
famished
hordes
all
the
chickens
and
farm
animals
had
been
slaughtered
this
was
true
of
all
the
main
roads
that
led
out
of
san
francisco
here
and
there
away
from
the
roads
farmers
had
held
their
own
with
shotguns
and
revolvers
and
were
still
holding
their
own
they
warned
us
away
and
refused
to
parley
with
us
and
all
the
destruction
and
violence
had
been
done
by
the
and
the
upper
classes
the
men
with
plentiful
food
supplies
remained
quietly
in
their
homes
in
the
cities
early
in
the
ride
we
received
concrete
proof
of
how
desperate
was
the
situation
to
the
right
of
us
we
heard
cries
and
bullets
whistled
dangerously
near
there
was
a
crashing
in
the
underbrush
then
a
magnificent
black
broke
across
the
road
in
front
of
us
and
was
gone
we
had
barely
time
to
notice
that
he
was
bleeding
and
lame
he
was
followed
by
three
soldiers
the
chase
went
on
among
the
trees
on
the
left
we
could
hear
the
soldiers
calling
to
one
another
a
fourth
soldier
limped
out
upon
the
road
from
the
right
sat
down
on
a
boulder
and
mopped
the
sweat
from
his
face
dakon
whispered
the
man
grinned
up
at
us
and
asked
for
a
match
in
reply
to
the
word
he
informed
us
that
the
militiamen
were
deserting
grub
he
explained
it
all
to
the
we
also
learned
from
him
that
the
military
prisoners
had
been
released
from
alcatraz
island
because
they
could
no
longer
be
fed
i
shall
never
forget
the
next
sight
we
encountered
we
came
upon
it
abruptly
around
a
turn
of
the
road
overhead
arched
the
trees
the
sunshine
was
filtering
down
through
the
branches
butterflies
were
fluttering
by
and
from
the
fields
came
the
song
of
larks
and
there
it
stood
a
powerful
touring
car
about
it
and
in
it
lay
a
number
of
corpses
it
told
its
own
tale
its
occupants
fleeing
from
the
city
had
been
attacked
and
dragged
down
by
a
gang
of
slum
the
thing
had
occurred
within
hours
freshly
opened
meat
and
fruit
tins
explained
the
reason
for
the
attack
dakon
examined
the
bodies
thought
so
he
reported
ridden
in
that
car
it
was
whole
family
got
to
watch
out
for
ourselves
from
now
we
have
no
food
with
which
to
invite
attack
i
objected
dakon
pointed
to
the
horse
i
rode
and
i
understood
early
in
the
day
horse
had
cast
a
shoe
the
delicate
hoof
had
split
and
by
noon
the
animal
was
limping
dakon
refused
to
ride
it
farther
and
refused
to
desert
it
so
on
his
solicitation
we
went
on
he
would
lead
the
horse
and
join
us
at
my
place
that
was
the
last
we
saw
of
him
nor
did
we
ever
learn
his
end
by
one
we
arrived
at
the
town
of
menlo
or
rather
at
the
site
of
menlo
for
it
was
in
ruins
corpses
lay
everywhere
the
business
part
of
the
town
as
well
as
part
of
the
residences
had
been
gutted
by
fire
here
and
there
a
residence
still
held
out
but
there
was
no
getting
near
them
when
we
approached
too
closely
we
were
fired
upon
we
met
a
woman
who
was
poking
about
in
the
smoking
ruins
of
her
cottage
the
first
attack
she
told
us
had
been
on
the
stores
and
as
she
talked
we
could
picture
that
raging
roaring
hungry
mob
flinging
itself
on
the
handful
of
townspeople
millionaires
and
paupers
had
fought
side
by
side
for
the
food
and
then
fought
with
one
another
after
they
got
it
the
town
of
palo
alto
and
stanford
university
had
been
sacked
in
similar
fashion
we
learned
ahead
of
us
lay
a
desolate
wasted
land
and
we
thought
we
were
wise
in
turning
off
to
my
place
it
lay
three
miles
to
the
west
snuggling
among
the
first
rolling
swells
of
the
foothills
but
as
we
rode
along
we
saw
that
the
devastation
was
not
confined
to
the
main
roads
the
van
of
the
flight
had
kept
to
the
roads
sacking
the
small
towns
as
it
went
while
those
that
followed
had
scattered
out
and
swept
the
whole
countryside
like
a
great
broom
my
place
was
built
of
concrete
masonry
and
tiles
and
so
had
escaped
being
burned
but
it
was
gutted
clean
we
found
the
body
in
the
windmill
littered
around
with
empty
shells
he
had
put
up
a
good
fight
but
no
trace
could
we
find
of
the
two
italian
labourers
nor
of
the
and
her
husband
not
a
live
thing
remained
the
calves
the
colts
all
the
fancy
poultry
and
thoroughbred
stock
everything
was
gone
the
kitchen
and
the
fireplaces
where
the
mob
had
cooked
were
a
mess
while
many
outside
bore
witness
to
the
large
number
that
had
fed
and
spent
the
night
what
they
had
not
eaten
they
had
carried
away
there
was
not
a
bite
for
us
we
spent
the
rest
of
the
night
vainly
waiting
for
dakon
and
in
the
morning
with
our
revolvers
fought
off
marauders
then
we
killed
one
of
horses
hiding
for
the
future
what
meat
we
did
not
immediately
eat
in
the
afternoon
collins
went
out
for
a
walk
but
failed
to
return
this
was
the
last
straw
to
hanover
he
was
for
flight
there
and
then
and
i
had
great
difficulty
in
persuading
him
to
wait
for
daylight
as
for
myself
i
was
convinced
that
the
end
of
the
general
strike
was
near
and
i
was
resolved
to
return
to
san
francisco
so
in
the
morning
we
parted
company
hanover
heading
south
fifty
pounds
of
strapped
to
his
saddle
while
i
similarly
loaded
headed
north
little
hanover
pulled
through
all
right
and
to
the
end
of
his
life
he
will
persist
i
know
in
boring
everybody
with
the
narrative
of
his
subsequent
adventures
i
got
as
far
as
belmont
on
the
main
road
back
when
i
was
robbed
of
my
by
three
militiamen
there
was
no
change
in
the
situation
they
said
except
that
it
was
going
from
bad
to
worse
the
had
plenty
of
provisions
hidden
away
and
could
last
out
for
months
i
managed
to
get
as
far
as
baden
when
my
horse
was
taken
away
from
me
by
a
dozen
men
two
of
them
were
san
francisco
policemen
and
the
remainder
were
regular
soldiers
this
was
ominous
the
situation
was
certainly
extreme
when
the
regulars
were
beginning
to
desert
when
i
continued
my
way
on
foot
they
already
had
the
fire
started
and
the
last
of
horses
lay
slaughtered
on
the
ground
as
luck
would
have
it
i
sprained
my
ankle
and
succeeded
in
getting
no
farther
than
south
san
francisco
i
lay
there
that
night
in
an
shivering
with
the
cold
and
at
the
same
time
burning
with
fever
two
days
i
lay
there
too
sick
to
move
and
on
the
third
reeling
and
giddy
supporting
myself
on
an
extemporized
crutch
i
tottered
on
toward
san
francisco
i
was
weak
as
well
for
it
was
the
third
day
since
food
had
passed
my
lips
it
was
a
day
of
nightmare
and
torment
as
in
a
dream
i
passed
hundreds
of
regular
soldiers
drifting
along
in
the
opposite
direction
and
many
policemen
with
their
families
organized
in
large
groups
for
mutual
protection
as
i
entered
the
city
i
remembered
the
house
at
which
i
had
traded
the
silver
pitcher
and
in
that
direction
my
hunger
drove
me
twilight
was
falling
when
i
came
to
the
place
i
passed
around
by
the
alleyway
and
crawled
up
the
black
steps
on
which
i
collapsed
i
managed
to
reach
out
with
the
crutch
and
knock
on
the
door
then
i
must
have
fainted
for
i
came
to
in
the
kitchen
my
face
wet
with
water
and
whisky
being
poured
down
my
throat
i
choked
and
spluttered
and
tried
to
talk
i
began
saying
something
about
not
having
any
more
silver
pitchers
but
that
i
would
make
it
up
to
them
afterward
if
they
would
only
give
me
something
to
eat
but
the
housewife
interrupted
me
you
poor
man
she
said
you
heard
the
strike
was
called
off
this
afternoon
of
course
give
you
something
to
she
bustled
around
opening
a
tin
of
breakfast
bacon
and
preparing
to
fry
it
me
have
some
now
please
i
begged
and
i
ate
the
raw
bacon
on
a
slice
of
bread
while
her
husband
explained
that
the
demands
of
the
had
been
granted
the
wires
had
been
opened
up
in
the
early
afternoon
and
everywhere
the
associations
had
given
in
there
been
any
employers
left
in
san
francisco
but
general
folsom
had
spoken
for
them
the
trains
and
steamers
would
start
running
in
the
morning
and
so
would
everything
else
just
as
soon
as
system
could
be
established
and
that
was
the
end
of
the
general
strike
i
never
want
to
see
another
one
it
was
worse
than
a
war
a
general
strike
is
a
cruel
and
immoral
thing
and
the
brain
of
man
should
be
capable
of
running
industry
in
a
more
rational
way
harrison
is
still
my
chauffeur
it
was
part
of
the
conditions
of
the
that
all
of
its
members
should
be
reinstated
in
their
old
positions
brown
never
came
back
but
the
rest
of
the
servants
are
with
me
i
the
heart
to
discharge
creatures
they
were
pretty
when
they
deserted
with
the
food
and
silver
and
now
i
discharge
them
they
have
all
been
unionized
by
the
the
tyranny
of
organized
labour
is
getting
beyond
human
endurance
something
must
be
done
the
wull
be
the
launch
said
captain
macelrath
the
pilot
grunted
while
the
skipper
swept
on
with
his
glass
from
the
launch
to
the
strip
of
beach
and
to
kingston
beyond
and
then
slowly
across
the
entrance
to
howth
head
on
the
northern
side
right
and
have
you
docked
in
two
hours
the
pilot
vouchsafed
with
an
effort
at
cheeriness
end
basin
is
it
this
time
the
skipper
grunted
dirty
dublin
again
the
skipper
grunted
he
was
weary
with
the
night
of
wind
in
the
irish
channel
behind
him
the
unbroken
hours
of
which
he
had
spent
on
the
bridge
and
he
was
weary
with
all
the
voyage
behind
years
and
four
months
between
home
port
and
home
port
eight
hundred
and
fifty
days
by
his
log
wunter
weather
he
answered
after
a
silence
town
is
undistinct
ut
wull
be
guid
hearty
for
the
captain
macelrath
was
a
small
man
just
comfortably
able
to
peep
over
the
canvas
dodger
of
the
bridge
the
pilot
and
third
officer
loomed
above
him
as
did
the
man
at
the
wheel
a
bulky
german
deserted
from
a
warship
whom
he
had
signed
on
in
rangoon
but
his
lack
of
inches
made
captain
macelrath
a
no
less
able
man
at
least
so
the
company
reckoned
and
so
would
he
have
reckoned
could
he
have
had
access
to
the
carefully
and
minutely
compiled
record
of
him
filed
away
in
the
office
archives
but
the
company
had
never
given
him
a
hint
of
its
faith
in
him
it
was
not
the
way
of
the
company
for
the
company
went
on
the
principle
of
never
allowing
an
employee
to
think
himself
indispensable
or
even
exceedingly
useful
wherefore
while
quick
to
censure
it
never
praised
what
was
captain
macelrath
anyway
save
a
skipper
one
skipper
of
the
skippers
that
commanded
the
freighters
on
all
the
highways
and
byways
of
the
sea
beneath
them
on
the
main
deck
two
chinese
stokers
were
carrying
breakfast
across
the
rusty
iron
plates
that
told
their
own
grim
story
of
weight
and
wash
of
sea
a
sailor
was
taking
down
the
that
stretched
from
the
forecastle
past
the
hatches
and
to
the
ladder
rough
voyage
suggested
the
pilot
she
was
fair
ot
times
but
not
thot
i
minded
thot
so
much
as
the
of
time
i
hate
like
tull
loss
so
saying
captain
macelrath
turned
and
glanced
aft
aloft
and
alow
and
the
pilot
following
his
gaze
saw
the
mute
but
convincing
explanation
of
that
loss
of
time
the
underneath
was
white
with
salt
while
the
glittered
crystalline
in
the
random
sunlight
that
broke
for
the
instant
through
a
the
port
lifeboat
was
missing
its
iron
davits
twisted
and
wrenched
testifying
to
the
mightiness
of
the
blow
that
had
been
struck
the
old
the
starboard
davits
were
also
empty
the
shattered
wreck
of
the
lifeboat
they
had
held
lay
on
the
fiddley
beside
the
smashed
skylight
which
was
covered
by
a
tarpaulin
below
to
on
the
bridge
deck
the
pilot
saw
the
crushed
door
roughly
bulkheaded
against
the
pounding
seas
abreast
of
it
on
the
smokestack
guys
and
being
taken
down
by
the
and
a
sailor
hung
the
huge
square
of
rope
netting
which
had
failed
to
break
those
seas
of
their
force
afore
i
mentioned

ut

about
captain
macelrath
assured
him
a
guid
ruddance
he
was
no
a
sailor
thot
he
was
only
fut
for
a
pugsty
a
dom
puir
apology
for
thot
it
is
said
that
there
are
three
kinds
of
protestant
and
that
the
irishman
is
a
transplanted
scotchman
captain
macelrath
was
a
man
and
talking
for
much
of
the
world
like
a
scotchman
nothing
aroused
his
ire
quicker
than
being
mistaken
for
a
scotchman
irish
he
stoutly
was
and
irish
he
stoutly
abided
though
it
was
with
a
faint
of
scorn
that
he
mentioned
mere
men
or
even
himself
he
was
presbyterian
while
in
his
own
community
five
men
were
all
that
ever
mustered
at
a
meeting
in
the
orange
hall
his
community
was
the
island
mcgill
where
seven
thousand
of
his
kind
lived
in
such
amity
and
sobriety
that
in
the
whole
island
there
was
but
one
policeman
and
never
a
at
all
captain
macelrath
did
not
like
the
sea
and
had
never
liked
it
he
wrung
his
livelihood
from
it
and
that
was
all
the
sea
was
the
place
where
he
worked
as
the
mill
the
shop
and
the
were
the
places
where
other
men
worked
romance
never
sang
to
him
her
siren
song
and
adventure
had
never
shouted
in
his
sluggish
blood
he
lacked
imagination
the
wonders
of
the
deep
were
without
significance
to
him
tornadoes
hurricanes
waterspouts
and
tidal
waves
were
so
many
obstacles
to
the
way
of
a
ship
on
the
sea
and
of
a
master
on
the
were
that
to
him
and
nothing
more
he
had
seen
and
yet
not
seen
the
many
marvels
and
wonders
of
far
lands
under
his
eyelids
burned
the
brazen
glories
of
the
tropic
seas
or
ached
the
bitter
gales
of
the
north
atlantic
or
far
south
pacific
but
his
memory
of
them
was
of
doors
stove
in
of
decks
awash
and
hatches
threatened
of
undue
coal
consumption
of
long
passages
and
of
fresh
spoiled
by
unexpected
squalls
of
rain
know
my
was
the
way
he
often
put
it
and
beyond
his
business
was
all
that
he
did
not
know
all
that
he
had
seen
with
the
mortal
eyes
of
him
and
yet
that
he
never
dreamed
existed
that
he
knew
his
business
his
owners
were
convinced
or
at
forty
he
would
not
have
held
command
of
the
three
thousand
tons
net
register
with
a
cargo
capacity
of
nine
thousand
tons
and
valued
at
pounds
he
had
taken
up
seafaring
through
no
love
of
it
but
because
it
had
been
his
destiny
because
he
had
been
the
second
son
of
his
father
instead
of
the
first
island
mcgill
was
only
so
large
and
the
land
could
support
but
a
certain
definite
proportion
of
those
that
dwelt
upon
it
the
balance
and
a
large
balance
it
was
was
driven
to
the
sea
to
seek
its
bread
it
had
been
so
for
generations
the
eldest
sons
took
the
farms
from
their
fathers
to
the
other
sons
remained
the
sea
and
its
so
it
was
that
donald
macelrath
son
and
himself
had
shifted
from
the
soil
he
loved
to
the
sea
he
hated
and
which
it
was
his
destiny
to
farm
and
farmed
it
he
had
for
twenty
years
shrewd
sober
industrious
and
thrifty
rising
from
boy
and
forecastle
hand
to
mate
and
master
of
and
thence
into
steam
second
officer
first
and
master
from
small
command
to
larger
and
at
last
to
the
bridge
of
the
old
to
be
sure
but
worth
her
fifty
thousand
pounds
and
still
able
to
bear
up
in
all
seas
and
weather
her
nine
thousand
tons
of
freight
from
the
bridge
of
the
the
high
place
he
had
gained
in
the
competition
of
men
he
stared
at
dublin
harbour
opening
out
at
the
town
obscured
by
the
dark
sky
of
the
dreary
day
and
at
the
tangled
tracery
of
spars
and
rigging
of
the
harbour
shipping
back
from
twice
around
the
world
he
was
and
from
interminable
junketings
up
and
down
on
far
stretches
to
the
wife
he
had
not
seen
in
months
and
to
the
child
he
had
never
seen
and
that
was
already
walking
and
talking
he
saw
the
watch
below
of
stokers
and
trimmers
bobbing
out
of
the
forecastle
doors
like
rabbits
from
a
warren
and
making
their
way
aft
over
the
rusty
deck
to
the
mustering
of
the
port
doctor
they
were
chinese
with
expressionless
faces
and
they
walked
in
peculiar
shambling
fashion
dragging
their
feet
as
if
the
clumsy
brogans
were
too
heavy
for
their
lean
shanks
he
saw
them
and
he
did
not
see
them
as
he
passed
his
hand
beneath
his
visored
cap
and
scratched
reflectively
his
mop
of
sandy
hair
for
the
scene
before
him
was
but
the
background
in
his
brain
for
the
vision
of
peace
that
was
vision
that
was
his
often
during
long
nights
on
the
bridge
when
the
old
wallowed
on
the
vexed
ocean
floor
her
decks
awash
her
rigging
thrumming
in
the
gale
gusts
or
snow
squalls
or
driving
tropic
rain
and
the
vision
he
saw
was
of
farm
and
and
outbuildings
of
children
playing
in
the
sun
and
the
good
wife
at
the
door
of
lowing
kine
and
clucking
fowls
and
the
stamp
of
horses
in
the
stable
of
his
farm
next
to
him
with
beyond
the
woodless
rolling
land
and
the
hedged
fields
neat
and
orderly
extending
to
the
crest
of
the
smooth
soft
hills
it
was
his
vision
and
his
dream
his
romance
and
adventure
the
goal
of
all
his
effort
the
high
reward
for
the
and
the
long
long
furrows
he
ran
up
and
down
the
whole
world
around
in
his
farming
of
the
sea
in
simple
taste
and
homely
inclination
this
man
was
more
simple
and
homely
than
the
veriest
yokel
years
his
father
was
and
had
never
slept
a
night
out
of
his
own
bed
in
his
own
house
on
island
mcgill
that
was
the
life
ideal
so
captain
macelrath
considered
and
he
was
prone
to
marvel
that
any
man
not
under
compulsion
should
leave
a
farm
to
go
to
sea
to
this
man
the
whole
world
was
as
familiar
as
the
village
to
the
cobbler
sitting
in
his
shop
to
captain
macelrath
the
world
was
a
village
in
his
eye
he
saw
its
streets
a
thousand
leagues
long
aye
and
longer
turnings
that
doubled
stormiest
headlands
or
were
the
way
to
quiet
inland
ponds
taken
one
way
that
led
to
and
summer
seas
and
that
led
the
other
way
to
bitter
ceaseless
gales
and
the
perilous
bergs
of
the
great
west
wind
drift
and
the
cities
bright
with
lights
were
as
shops
on
these
long
where
business
was
transacted
where
bunkers
were
replenished
cargoes
taken
or
shifted
and
orders
received
from
the
owners
in
london
town
to
go
elsewhere
and
beyond
ever
along
the
long
seeking
new
cargoes
here
carrying
new
cargoes
there
running
freights
wherever
shillings
and
pence
beckoned
and
underwriters
did
not
forbid
but
it
was
all
a
weariness
to
contemplate
and
save
that
he
wrung
from
it
his
bread
it
was
without
profit
under
the
sun
the
last
to
the
wife
had
been
at
cardiff
months
before
when
he
sailed
for
valparaiso
with
thousand
tons
and
down
to
his
marks
from
valparaiso
he
had
gone
to
australia
light
a
matter
of
six
thousand
miles
on
end
with
a
stormy
passage
and
running
short
of
bunker
coal
coals
again
to
oregon
seven
thousand
miles
and
nigh
as
many
more
with
general
cargo
for
japan
and
china
thence
to
java
loading
sugar
for
marseilles
and
back
along
the
mediterranean
to
the
black
sea
and
on
to
baltimore
down
to
her
marks
with
crome
ore
buffeted
by
hurricanes
short
again
of
bunker
coal
and
calling
at
bermuda
to
replenish
then
a

charter

loading
mysterious
contraband

and
sailing
for

africa
under
orders
of
the
mysterious
german
supercargo
put
on
board
by
the
charterers
on
to
madagascar
steaming
four
knots
by
the
orders
and
the
suspicion
forming
that
the
russian
fleet
might
want
the
coal
confusion
and
delays
long
waits
at
sea
international
complications
the
whole
world
excited
over
the
old

cargo
of

then
on

and
the
naval
port
of

back

another

months
eight
hundred
and
fifty
days
by
the
log
steaming
up
and
down
the
and
back
again
to
dublin
town
and
he
was
well
aweary
a
little
tug
had
laid
hold
of
the
and
with
clang
and
clatter
and
shouted
command
with
engines
or
the
battered
old
was
nudged
and
nosed
and
shouldered
through
the
into
end
basin
lines
were
flung
ashore
fore
and
aft
and
a
spring
got
out
already
a
small
group
of
the
happy
folk
had
clustered
on
the
dock
off
captain
macelrath
commanded
in
his
slow
thick
voice
and
the
third
officer
worked
the
lever
of
the
telegraph
out
called
the
second
officer
and
when
this
was
accomplished
will
it
was
the
last
task
of
all
gangway
out
will
was
the
dismissal
the
voyage
was
ended
and
the
crew
shambled
eagerly
forward
across
the
rusty
decks
to
where
their
were
packed
and
ready
for
the
shore
the
taste
of
the
land
was
strong
in
the
mouths
and
strong
it
was
in
the
mouth
as
he
muttered
a
gruff
good
day
to
the
departing
pilot
and
himself
went
down
to
his
cabin
up
the
gangway
were
trooping
the
customs
officers
the
surveyor
the
clerk
and
the
stevedores
quick
work
disposed
of
these
and
cleared
his
cabin
the
agent
waiting
to
take
him
to
the
office
ye
send
word
tull
the
wife
had
been
his
greeting
to
the
clerk
a
telegram
as
soon
as
you
were
likely
be
down
on
the
train
the
skipper
had
soliloquized
and
gone
inside
to
change
his
clothes
and
wash
he
took
a
last
glance
about
the
room
and
at
two
photographs
on
the
wall
one
of
the
wife
the
other
of
an
child
he
had
never
seen
he
stepped
out
into
the
cabin
with
its
panelled
walls
of
cedar
and
maple
and
with
its
long
table
that
seated
ten
and
at
which
he
had
eaten
by
himself
through
all
the
weary
time
no
laughter
and
clatter
and
wordy
argument
of
the
had
been
his
he
had
eaten
silently
almost
morosely
his
silence
emulated
by
the
noiseless
asiatic
who
had
served
him
it
came
to
him
suddenly
the
overwhelming
realization
of
the
loneliness
of
those
two
years
and
more
all
his
vexations
and
anxieties
had
been
his
own
he
had
shared
them
with
no
one
his
two
young
officers
were
too
young
and
flighty
the
mate
too
stupid
there
was
no
consulting
with
them
one
tenant
had
shared
the
cabin
with
him
that
tenant
his
responsibility
they
had
dined
and
supped
together
walked
the
bridge
together
and
together
they
had
bedded
he
muttered
to
that
grim
companion
quit
of
you
wull
quit
for
a
ashore
he
passed
the
last
of
the
seamen
with
their
bags
and
at
the
with
the
usual
delays
put
through
his
ship
business
when
asked
out
by
them
to
drink
he
took
milk
and
soda
am
no
teetotaler
he
explained
for
the
life
me
i
canna
bide
beer
or
in
the
early
afternoon
when
he
finished
paying
off
his
crew
he
hurried
to
the
private
office
where
he
had
been
told
his
wife
was
waiting
his
eyes
were
for
her
first
though
the
temptation
was
great
to
have
more
than
a
hurried
glimpse
of
the
child
in
the
chair
beside
her
he
held
her
off
from
him
after
the
long
embrace
and
looked
into
her
face
long
and
steadily
drinking
in
every
feature
of
it
and
wondering
that
he
could
mark
no
changes
of
time
a
warm
man
his
wife
thought
him
though
had
the
opinion
of
his
officers
been
asked
it
would
have
been
a
harsh
man
and
a
bitter
one
annie
how
is
ut
ye
he
queried
and
drew
her
to
him
again
and
again
he
held
her
away
from
him
this
wife
of
ten
years
and
of
whom
he
knew
so
little
she
was
almost
a
a
stranger
than
his
chinese
steward
and
certainly
far
more
a
stranger
than
his
own
officers
whom
he
had
seen
every
day
day
and
day
for
eight
hundred
and
fifty
days
married
ten
years
and
in
that
time
he
had
been
with
her
nine
a
honeymoon
each
time
home
had
been
a
getting
acquainted
again
with
her
it
was
the
fate
of
the
men
who
went
out
to
the
little
they
knew
of
their
wives
and
less
of
their
children
there
was
his
chief
told
the
story
of
returning
home
to
be
locked
out
of
his
house
by
his
kiddie
that
never
had
laid
eyes
on
him
before
thus
be
the
loddie
the
skipper
said
reaching
out
a
hesitant
hand
to
the
cheek
but
the
boy
drew
away
from
him
sheltering
against
the
side
she
cried
he
doesna
know
his
own
i
hum
heaven
knows
i
could
no
hum
out
of
a
crowd
though
be
your
nose
your
own
eyes
donald
look
ut
them
your
own
father
laddie
kiss
hum
like
the
little
mon
ye
but
the
child
drew
closer
to
her
his
expression
of
fear
and
distrust
growing
stronger
and
when
the
father
attempted
to
take
him
in
his
arms
he
threatened
to
cry
the
skipper
straightened
up
and
to
conceal
the
pang
at
his
heart
he
drew
out
his
watch
and
looked
at
it
time
to
go
annie
he
said
train
be
he
was
silent
on
the
train
at
first
divided
between
watching
the
wife
with
the
child
going
to
sleep
in
her
arms
and
looking
out
of
the
window
at
the
tilled
fields
and
green
unforested
hills
vague
and
indistinct
in
the
driving
drizzle
that
had
set
in
they
had
the
compartment
to
themselves
when
the
boy
slept
she
laid
him
out
on
the
seat
and
wrapped
him
warmly
and
when
the
health
of
relatives
and
friends
had
been
inquired
after
and
the
gossip
of
island
mcgill
narrated
along
with
the
weather
and
the
price
of
land
and
crops
there
was
little
left
to
talk
about
save
themselves
and
captain
macelrath
took
up
the
tale
brought
home
for
the
good
wife
from
all
his
wandering
but
it
was
not
a
tale
of
marvels
he
told

of

his

flashed
eagerly
on

and
he
straightened
up
as
might
a
man
about
to
engage
in
some
agreeable
task
it
was
the
farm

felt
the
train

and
peered
again
through
the
misty
window
he
stood
up
buttoned
his
overcoat
turned
up
the
collar
and
awkwardly
gathered
the
child

happiness
was
in
both
their
faces
at
the
prospect
and
for
a
moment
both
saw
the
same
vision
of
peace
annie
leaned
toward
him
and
as
the
train
stopped
they
kissed
each
other
across
the
sleeping
child
samuel
margaret
henan
would
have
been
a
striking
figure
under
any
circumstances
but
never
more
so
than
when
i
first
chanced
upon
her
a
sack
of
grain
of
fully
a
hundredweight
on
her
shoulder
as
she
walked
with
sure
though
tottering
stride
from
the
to
the
stable
pausing
for
an
instant
to
gather
strength
at
the
foot
of
the
steep
steps
that
led
to
the
there
were
four
of
these
steps
and
she
went
up
them
a
step
at
a
time
slowly
unwaveringly
and
with
so
dogged
certitude
that
it
never
entered
my
mind
that
her
strength
could
fail
her
and
let
that
sack
fall
from
the
lean
and
withered
frame
that
wellnigh
doubled
under
it
for
she
was
patently
an
old
woman
and
it
was
her
age
that
made
me
linger
by
the
cart
and
watch
six
times
she
went
between
the
cart
and
the
stable
each
time
with
a
full
sack
on
her
back
and
beyond
passing
the
time
of
day
with
me
she
took
no
notice
of
my
presence
then
the
cart
empty
she
fumbled
for
matches
and
lighted
a
short
clay
pipe
pressing
down
the
burning
surface
of
the
tobacco
with
a
calloused
and
apparently
nerveless
thumb
the
hands
were
noteworthy
they
were
sinewy
and
malformed
by
labour
rimed
with
callouses
the
nails
blunt
and
broken
and
with
here
and
there
cuts
and
bruises
healed
and
healing
such
as
are
common
to
the
hands
of
men
on
the
back
were
huge
upstanding
veins
eloquent
of
age
and
toil
looking
at
them
it
was
hard
to
believe
that
they
were
the
hands
of
the
woman
who
had
once
been
the
belle
of
island
mcgill
this
last
of
course
i
learned
later
at
the
time
i
knew
neither
her
history
nor
her
identity
she
wore
heavy
brogans
her
legs
were
stockingless
and
i
had
noticed
when
she
walked
that
her
bare
feet
were
thrust
into
the
crinkly
shoes
that
sloshed
about
her
lean
ankles
at
every
step
her
figure
shapeless
and
waistless
was
garbed
in
a
rough
shirt
and
in
a
ragged
flannel
petticoat
that
had
once
been
red
but
it
was
her
face
wrinkled
withered
and
surrounded
by
an
aureole
of
unkempt
and
straggling
wisps
of
greyish
hair
that
caught
and
held
me
neither
drifted
hair
nor
serried
wrinkles
could
hide
the
splendid
dome
of
a
forehead
high
and
broad
without
verging
in
the
slightest
on
the
abnormal
the
sunken
cheeks
and
pinched
nose
told
little
of
the
quality
of
the
life
that
flickered
behind
those
clear
blue
eyes
of
hers
despite
the
minutiæ
of
that
somehow
failed
to
weazen
them
her
eyes
were
clear
as
a
and
and
with
an
open
and
unblinking
steadfastness
of
gaze
that
was
disconcerting
the
remarkable
thing
was
the
distance
between
them
it
is
a
lucky
man
or
woman
who
has
the
width
of
an
eye
between
but
with
margaret
henan
the
width
between
her
eyes
was
fully
that
of
an
eye
and
a
half
yet
so
symmetrically
moulded
was
her
face
that
this
remarkable
feature
produced
no
uncanny
effect
and
for
that
matter
would
have
escaped
the
casual
notice
the
mouth
shapeless
and
toothless
with
corners
and
lips
dry
and
nevertheless
lacked
the
muscular
slackness
so
usual
with
age
the
lips
might
have
been
those
of
a
mummy
save
for
that
impression
of
rigid
firmness
they
gave
not
that
they
were
atrophied
on
the
contrary
they
seemed
tense
and
set
with
a
muscular
and
spiritual
determination
there
and
in
the
eyes
was
the
secret
of
the
certitude
with
which
she
carried
the
heavy
sacks
up
the
steep
steps
with
never
a
false
step
or
overbalance
and
emptied
them
in
the
are
an
old
woman
to
be
working
like
this
i
ventured
she
looked
at
me
with
that
strange
unblinking
gaze
and
she
thought
and
spoke
with
the
slow
deliberateness
that
characterized
everything
about
her
as
if
well
aware
of
an
eternity
that
was
hers
and
in
which
there
was
no
need
for
haste
again
i
was
impressed
by
the
enormous
certitude
of
her
in
this
eternity
that
seemed
so
indubitably
hers
there
was
time
and
to
spare
for
and
stable
certitude
in
short
no
more
in
her
spiritual
life
than
in
carrying
the
hundredweights
of
grain
was
there
a
possibility
of
a
misstep
or
an
overbalancing
the
feeling
produced
in
me
was
uncanny
here
was
a
human
soul
that
save
for
the
most
glimmering
of
contacts
was
beyond
the
humanness
of
me
and
the
more
i
learned
of
margaret
henan
in
the
weeks
that
followed
the
more
mysteriously
remote
she
became
she
was
as
alien
as
a
from
some
other
star
and
no
hint
could
she
nor
all
the
countryside
give
me
of
what
forms
of
living
what
heats
of
feeling
or
rules
of
philosophic
contemplation
actuated
her
in
all
that
she
had
been
and
was
wull
be
come
guid
friday
a
fortnight
she
said
in
reply
to
my
question
you
are
an
old
woman
to
be
doing
this
work
and
a
strong
work
at
that
i
insisted
again
she
seemed
to
immerse
herself
in
that
atmosphere
of
contemplative
eternity
and
so
strangely
did
it
affect
me
that
i
should
not
have
been
surprised
to
have
awaked
a
century
or
so
later
and
found
her
just
beginning
to
enunciate
her
work
hoz

be
done

she
drew
out
her
pipe
for
a
moment
then
added
with
a
nod
of
her
head
toward
the
house
wuth
i
glanced
at
the
house
and
commodious
at
the
large
stable
and
at
the
large
array
of
fields
i
knew
must
belong
with
the
place

a
big
bit
of
land
for
you
to
farm
by
aye

she
clambered
into
the
cart
gathered
the
reins
in
her
hands
and
quizzed
me
with
her
keen
shrewd
eyes
ye
hail
from
over
the
a
yankee
i
answered
wull
no
be
mony
island
mcgill
folk
un

i
remember
ever
meeting
one
in
the
she
nodded
her
head
are
bodies
though
i
wull
no

they
are
no
yet
they

ot
the
last

no

ot

or

by
fevers
un
foreign
your
sons
will
have
gone
to

and
come
home
again
i
queried
aye
all
samuel
oz
was
at
the
mention
of
samuel
i
could
have
sworn
to
a
strange
light
in
her
eyes
and
it
seemed
to
me
as
by
some
telepathic
flash
that
i
divined
in
her
a
tremendous
wistfulness
an
immense
yearning
it
seemed
to
me
that
here
was
the
key
to
her
inscrutableness
the
clue
that
if
followed
properly
would
make
all
her
strangeness
plain
it
came
to
me
that
here
was
a
contact
and
that
for
the
moment
i
was
glimpsing
into
the
soul
of
her
the
question
was
tickling
on
my
tongue
but
she
forestalled
me
she
to
the
horse
and
with
a
day
tull
you
sir
drove
off
a
simple
homely
people
are
the
folk
of
island
mcgill
and
i
doubt
if
a
more
sober
thrifty
and
industrious
folk
is
to
be
found
in
all
the
world
meeting
them
to
meet
them
abroad
one
must
meet
them
on
the
sea
for
a
hybrid
seafaring
and
farmer
breed
are
would
never
take
them
to
be
irish
irish
they
claim
to
be
speaking
of
the
north
of
ireland
with
pride
and
sneering
at
their
scottish
brothers
yet
scotch
they
undoubtedly
are
transplanted
scotch
of
long
ago
it
is
true
but
none
the
less
scotch
with
a
thousand
traits
to
say
nothing
of
their
tricks
of
speech
and
woolly
utterance
which
nothing
less
than
their
scotch
clannishness
could
have
preserved
to
this
late
day
a
narrow
loch
scarcely
half
a
mile
wide
separates
island
mcgill
from
the
mainland
of
ireland
and
once
across
this
loch
one
finds
himself
in
an
entirely
different
country
the
scotch
impression
is
strong
and
the
people
to
commence
with
are
presbyterians
when
it
is
considered
that
there
is
no
in
all
the
island
and
that
seven
thousand
souls
dwell
therein
some
idea
may
be
gained
of
the
temperateness
of
the
community
wedded
to
old
ways
public
opinion
and
the
ministers
are
powerful
influences
while
fathers
and
mothers
are
revered
and
obeyed
as
in
few
other
places
in
this
modern
world
courting
lasts
never
later
than
ten
at
night
and
no
girl
walks
out
with
her
young
man
without
her
knowledge
and
consent
the
young
men
go
down
to
the
sea
and
sow
their
wild
oats
in
the
wicked
ports
returning
periodically
between
voyages
to
live
the
old
intensive
morality
to
court
till
ten
to
sit
under
the
minister
each
sunday
and
to
listen
at
home
to
the
same
stern
precepts
that
the
elders
preached
to
them
from
the
time
they
were
laddies
much
they
learned
of
women
in
the
ends
of
the
earth
these
seafaring
sons
yet
a
canny
wisdom
was
theirs
and
they
never
brought
wives
home
with
them
the
one
solitary
exception
to
this
had
been
the
schoolmaster
who
had
been
guilty
of
bringing
a
wife
from
half
a
mile
the
other
side
of
the
loch
for
this
he
had
never
been
forgiven
and
he
rested
under
a
cloud
for
the
remainder
of
his
days
at
his
death
the
wife
went
back
across
the
loch
to
her
own
people
and
the
blot
on
the
escutcheon
of
island
mcgill
was
erased
in
the
end
the
married
girls
of
their
own
homeland
and
settled
down
to
become
exemplars
of
all
the
virtues
for
which
the
island
was
noted
island
mcgill
was
without
a
history
she
boasted
none
of
the
events
that
go
to
make
history
there
had
never
been
any
wearing
of
the
green
any
fenian
conspiracies
any
land
disturbances
there
had
been
but
one
eviction
and
that
purely
test
case
and
on
advice
of
the
lawyer
so
island
mcgill
was
without
annals
history
had
passed
her
by
she
paid
her
taxes
acknowledged
her
crowned
rulers
and
left
the
world
alone
all
she
asked
in
return
was
that
the
world
should
leave
her
alone
the
world
was
composed
of
two
mcgill
and
the
rest
of
it
and
whatever
was
not
island
mcgill
was
outlandish
and
barbarian
and
well
she
knew
for
did
not
her
seafaring
sons
bring
home
report
of
that
world
and
its
ungodly
ways
it
was
from
the
skipper
of
a
glasgow
tramp
as
passenger
from
colombo
to
rangoon
that
i
had
first
learned
of
the
existence
of
island
mcgill
and
it
was
from
him
that
i
had
carried
the
letter
that
gave
me
entrance
to
the
house
of
ross
widow
of
a
master
mariner
with
a
daughter
living
with
her
and
with
two
sons
master
mariners
themselves
and
out
upon
the
sea
ross
did
not
take
in
boarders
and
it
was
captain
letter
alone
that
had
enabled
me
to
get
from
her
bed
and
board
in
the
evening
after
my
encounter
with
margaret
henan
i
questioned
ross
and
i
knew
on
the
instant
that
i
had
in
truth
stumbled
upon
mystery
like
all
island
mcgill
folk
as
i
was
soon
to
discover
ross
was
at
first
averse
to
discussing
margaret
henan
at
all
yet
it
was
from
her
i
learned
that
evening
that
margaret
henan
had
once
been
one
of
the
island
belles
herself
the
daughter
of
a
farmer
she
had
married
thomas
henan
equally
beyond
the
usual
tasks
she
had
never
been
accustomed
to
work
unlike
many
of
the
island
women
she
had
never
lent
a
hand
in
the
fields
what
of
her
children
i
asked
the
sons
jamie
timothy
uz
married
be
tull
sea
thot
bug
house
close
tull
the
post
office
uz
the
daughters
thot
no
married
be
wuth
them
as
dud
marry
the
rest
be
samuels
clara
interpolated
with
what
i
suspected
was
a
giggle
she
was
daughter
a
strapping
young
woman
with
handsome
features
and
remarkably
handsome
black
eyes
naught
to
be
ot
her
mother
reproved
her
samuels
i
intervened
four
sons
thot
were
they
all
named
samuel
i
commented
in
the
lagging
silence
strange
ross
affirmed
proceeding
stolidly
with
the
knitting
of
the
woollen
singlet
on
her
of
the
countless
that
she
interminably
knitted
for
her
skipper
sons
it
was
only
the
samuels
that
died
i
queried
in
further
attempt
others
luved
was
the
answer
fine
finer
on
the
island
no
better
lods
ever
sailed
out
of
island
mcgill
the
munuster
held
them
up
oz
models
tull
pottern
after
nor
was
ever
a
whusper
breathed
the
why
is
she
left
alone
now
in
her
old
age
i
persisted
her
own
flesh
and
blood
look
after
her
why
does
she
live
alone
they
ever
go
to
see
her
or
care
for
her
a
one
un
twenty
years
more
now
she
fetched
ut
on
tull
herself
she
drove
them
from
the
house
just
oz
she
drove
old
tom
henan
thot
was
her
husband
tull
hus
i
ventured
ross
shook
her
head
scornfully
as
if
drink
was
a
weakness
beneath
the
weakest
of
island
mcgill
a
long
pause
followed
during
which
ross
knitted
stolidly
on
only
nodding
permission
when
young
man
mate
on
one
of
the
shire
line
sailing
ships
came
to
walk
out
with
her
i
studied
the
ostrich
eggs
hanging
in
the
corner
against
the
wall
like
a
cluster
of
some
monstrous
fruit
on
each
shell
were
painted
precipitous
and
impossible
seas
through
which
ships
foamed
with
a
lack
of
perspective
only
equalled
by
their
sharp
technical
perfection
on
the
mantelpiece
stood
two
large
pearl
shells
obviously
a
pair
intricately
carved
by
the
patient
hands
of
new
caledonian
convicts
in
the
centre
of
the
mantel
was
a
stuffed
while
about
the
room
were
scattered
gorgeous
shells
from
the
southern
seas
delicate
sprays
of
coral
sprouting
from
barnacled
shells
and
cased
in
glass
assegais
from
south
africa
stone
axes
from
new
guinea
huge
alaskan
beaded
with
heraldic
totem
designs
a
boomerang
from
australia
divers
ships
in
glass
bottles
a
cannibal
bowl
from
the
marquesas
and
fragile
cabinets
from
china
and
the
indies
and
inlaid
with
and
precious
woods
i
gazed
at
this
varied
trove
brought
home
by
sailor
sons
and
pondered
the
mystery
of
margaret
henan
who
had
driven
her
husband
to
his
death
and
been
forsaken
by
all
her
kin
it
was
not
the
drink
then
what
was
it
shocking
cruelty
some
amazing
infidelity
or
some
fearful
i
broached
my
theories
but
to
all
ross
shook
her
head
was
no
thot
she
said
was
a
guid
wife
a
guid
mother
i
doubt
she
would
harm
a
fly

brought

fomuly
her
trouble

thot
she
took
ross

significantly
on
her
forehead

of
addlement

ot

from

next
morning
i
got
the
tale
of
margaret
favourite
brother
and
from
here
and
there
in
the
week
that
followed
i
pieced
together
the
tragedy
of
margaret
henan
samuel
dundee
had
been
the
youngest
of
four
brothers
and
as
clara
told
me
she
had
worshipped
him
he
was
going
to
sea
at
the
time
skipper
of
one
of
the
sailing
ships
of
the
bank
line
when
he
married
agnes
hewitt
she
was
described
as
a
slender
wisp
of
a
girl
delicately
featured
and
with
a
nervous
organization
of
the
supersensitive
order
theirs
had
been
the
first
marriage
in
the
church
and
after
a
honeymoon
samuel
had
kissed
his
bride
and
sailed
in
command
of
the
a
big
barque
and
it
was
because
of
the
church
that
the
blunder
occurred
nor
was
it
the
blunder
of
the
minister
alone
as
one
of
the
elders
later
explained
for
it
was
equally
the
blunder
of
the
whole
presbytery
of
coughleen
which
included
fifteen
churches
on
island
mcgill
and
the
mainland
the
old
church
beyond
repair
had
been
torn
down
and
the
new
one
built
on
the
original
foundation
looking
upon
the
as
similar
to
a
keel
it
never
entered
the
nor
the
head
that
the
new
church
was
legally
any
other
than
the
old
church
three
couples
was
married
the
first
week
un
the
new
church
clara
said
of
all
samuel

no
one

of
the
wuckedness

the
imp
of
the
perverse
must
have
chuckled
at
the
situation
all
things
favoured
the
marriages
had
taken
place
in
the
first
week
of
may
and
it
was
not
till
three
months
later
that
the
minister
as
required
by
law
made
his
quarterly
report
to
the
civil
authorities
in
dublin
promptly
came
back
the
announcement
that
his
church
had
no
legal
existence
not
being
registered
according
to
the
demands
this
was
overcome
by
prompt
registration
but
the
marriages
were
not
to
be
so
easily
remedied
the
three
sailor
husbands
were
away
and
their
wives
in

six
months
later
eddie
troy
came
home
and
was
promptly
remarried
but
samuel
dundee
was
away
on
a
voyage
and
his
ship
fell
overdue
further
to
complicate
the
situation
a
baby
boy
past
two
years
old
was
waiting
for
him
in
the
arms
of
his
wife
the
months
passed
and
the
wife
grew
thin
with
worrying
no
meself
on
she
is
reported
to
have
said
many
times
the
puir
fatherless
bairn
uf
aught
happened
tull
samuel
where
wull
the
bairn
stond
posted
the
as
missing
and
the
owners
ceased
the
monthly
remittance
of
to
his
wife
it
was
the
question
of
the
legitimacy
that
preyed
on
her
mind
and
when
all
hope
of
return
was
abandoned
she
drowned
herself
and
the
child
in
the
loch
and
here
enters
the
greater
tragedy
the
was
not
lost
by
a
series
of
sea
disasters
and
delays
too
interminable
to
relate
she
had
made
one
of
those
long
unsighted
passages
such
as
occur
once
or
twice
in
half
a
century
how
the
imp
must
have
held
both
his
sides
back
from
the
sea
came
samuel
and
when
they
broke
the
news
to
him
something
else
broke
somewhere
in
his
heart
or
head
next
morning
they
found
him
where
he
had
tried
to
kill
himself
across
the
grave
of
his
wife
and
child
never
in
the
history
of
island
mcgill
was
there
so
fearful
a
he
spat
in
the
face
and
reviled
him
and
died
blaspheming
so
terribly
that
those
that
tended
on
him
did
so
with
averted
gaze
and
trembling
hands
and
in
the
face
of
all
this
margaret
henan
named
her
first
child
samuel
how
account
for
the
stubbornness
or
was
it
a
morbid
obsession
that
demanded
a
child
of
hers
should
be
named
samuel
her
third
child
was
a
girl
named
after
herself
and
the
fourth
was
a
boy
again
despite
the
strokes
of
fate
that
had
already
bereft
her
and
despite
the
loss
of
friends
and
relatives
she
persisted
in
her
resolve
to
name
the
child
after
her
brother
she
was
shunned
at
church
by
those
who
had
grown
up
with
her
her
mother
after
a
final
appeal
left
her
house
with
the
warning
that
if
the
child
were
so
named
she
would
never
speak
to
her
again
and
though
the
old
lady
lived
years
longer
she
kept
her
word
the
minister
agreed
to
christen
the
child
any
name
but
samuel
and
every
other
minister
on
island
mcgill
refused
to
christen
it
by
the
name
she
had
chosen
there
was
talk
on
the
part
of
margaret
henan
of
going
to
law
at
the
time
but
in
the
end
she
carried
the
child
to
belfast
and
there
had
it
christened
samuel
and
then
nothing
happened
the
whole
island
was
confuted
the
boy
grew
and
prospered
the
schoolmaster
never
ceased
averring
that
it
was
the
brightest
lad
he
had
ever
seen
samuel
had
a
splendid
constitution
a
tremendous
grip
on
life
to
amazement
he
escaped
the
usual
run
of
childish
afflictions
measles
and
mumps
knew
him
not
he
was
against
germs
immune
to
all
disease
headaches
and
earaches
were
things
unknown
so
much
oz
a
boil
or
a
pumple
as
one
of
the
old
bodies
told
me
ever
marred
his
healthy
skin
he
broke
school
records
in
scholarship
and
athletics
and
whipped
every
boy
of
his
size
or
years
on
island
mcgill
it
was
a
triumph
for
margaret
henan
this
paragon
was
hers
and
it
bore
the
cherished
name
with
the
one
exception
of
her
mother
friends
and
relatives
drifted
back
and
acknowledged
that
they
had
been
mistaken
though
there
were
old
crones
who
still
abided
by
their
opinion
and
who
shook
their
heads
ominously
over
their
cups
of
tea
the
boy
was
too
wonderful
to
last
there
was
no
escaping
the
curse
of
the
name
his
mother
had
wickedly
laid
upon
him
the
young
generation
joined
margaret
henan
in
laughing
at
them
but
the
old
crones
continued
to
shake
their
heads
other
children
followed
margaret
fifth
was
a
boy
whom
she
called
jamie
and
in
rapid
succession
followed
three
girls
alice
sara
and
nora
the
boy
timothy
and
two
more
girls
florence
and
katie
katie
was
the
last
and
eleventh
and
margaret
henan
at
ceased
from
her
exertions
she
had
done
well
by
island
mcgill
and
the
queen
nine
healthy
children
were
hers
all
prospered
it
seemed
her
had
shot
its
bolt
with
the
deaths
of
her
first
two
nine
lived
and
one
of
them
was
named
samuel
jamie
elected
to
follow
the
sea
though
it
was
not
so
much
a
matter
of
election
as
compulsion
for
the
eldest
sons
on
island
mcgill
remained
on
the
land
while
all
other
sons
went
to
the
timothy
followed
jamie
and
by
the
time
the
latter
had
got
his
first
command
a
steamer
in
the
bay
trade
out
of
cardiff
timothy
was
mate
of
a
big
sailing
ship
samuel
however
did
not
take
kindly
to
the
soil
the
life
had
no
attraction
for
him
his
brothers
went
to
sea
not
out
of
desire
but
because
it
was
the
only
way
for
them
to
gain
their
bread
and
he
who
had
no
need
to
go
envied
them
when
returned
from
far
voyages
they
sat
by
the
kitchen
fire
and
told
their
bold
tales
of
the
wonderlands
beyond
the
samuel
became
a
teacher
much
to
his
disgust
and
even
took
extra
certificates
going
to
belfast
for
his
examinations
when
the
old
master
retired
samuel
took
over
his
school
secretly
however
he
studied
navigation
and
it
was
delight
when
he
sat
by
the
kitchen
fire
and
despite
their
tickets
tangled
up
his
brothers
in
the
theoretics
of
their
profession
tom
henan
alone
was
outraged
when
samuel
school
teacher
gentleman
and
heir
to
the
henan
farm
shipped
to
sea
before
the
mast
margaret
had
an
abiding
faith
in
her
star
and
whatever
he
did
she
was
sure
was
for
the
best
like
everything
else
connected
with
his
glorious
personality
there
had
never
been
known
so
swift
a
rise
as
in
the
case
of
samuel
barely
with
two
sea
experience
before
the
mast
he
was
taken
from
the
forecastle
and
made
a
provisional
second
mate
this
occurred
in
a
fever
port
on
the
west
coast
and
the
committee
of
skippers
that
examined
him
agreed
that
he
knew
more
of
the
science
of
navigation
than
they
had
remembered
or
forgotten
two
years
later
he
sailed
from
liverpool
mate
of
the
with
both
and
tickets
in
his
possession
and
then
it
thing
the
old
crones
had
been
shaking
their
heads
over
for
years
it
was
told
me

gavin

body

tull
he
was
like
so
much
and
here
enters
the
marvel
of
it
the
miraculous
wonder
of
that
heroic
spirit
margaret
henan
was
when
the
news
came
home
of
the
loss
of
samuel
and
it
was
not
long
after
that
the
unbelievable
rumour
went
around
island
mcgill
i
say
unbelievable
island
mcgill
would
not
believe
doctor
hall
it
everybody
laughed
at
it
as
a
good
joke
they
traced
back
the
gossip
to
sara
dack
servant
to
the
and
who
alone
lived
with
margaret
and
her
husband
but
sara
dack
persisted
in
her
assertion
and
was
called
a
liar
one
or
two
dared
question
tom
henan
himself
but
beyond
black
looks
and
curses
for
their
presumption
they
elicited
nothing
from
him
the
rumour
died
down
and
the
island
fell
to
discussing
in
all
its
ramifications
the
loss
of
the
in
the
china
seas
with
all
her
officers
and
half
her
crew
born
and
married
on
island
mcgill
but
the
rumour
would
not
stay
down
sara
dack
was
louder
in
her
assertions
the
looks
tom
henan
cast
about
him
were
blacker
than
ever
and
hall
after
a
visit
to
the
henan
house
no
longer
then
island
mcgill
sat
up
and
there
was
a
tremendous
wagging
of
tongues
it
was
unnatural
and
ungodly
the
like
had
never
been
heard
and
when
as
time
passed
the
truth
of
sara
utterances
was
manifest
the
island
folk
decided
like
the
of
the
that
only
the
devil
could
have
had
a
hand
in
so
untoward
a
happening
and
the
infatuated
woman
so
sara
dack
reported
insisted
that
it
would
be
a
boy
bairns
i
borne
she
said

boy
it
was
and
a
prodigy
hall
raved
about
its
unblemished
perfection
and
massive
strength
and
wrote
a
brochure
on
it
for
the
dublin
medical
society
as
the
most
interesting
case
of
the
sort
in
his
long
career
when
sara
dack
gave
the
unbelievable
weight
island
mcgill
refused
to
believe
and
once
again
called
her
liar
but
when
doctor
hall
attested
that
he
had
himself
weighed
it
and
seen
it
tip
that
very
notch
island
mcgill
held
its
breath
and
accepted
whatever
report
sara
dack
made
of
the
progress
or
appetite
and
once
again
margaret
henan
carried
a
babe
to
belfast

time

buxom
phlegmatic
spinster
of
sixty
equipped
with
an
experience
so
tragic
and
unusual
that
though
her
tongue
ran
on
for
decades
its
output
would
still
be
of
imperishable
interest
to
her
cronies

and
regarded
margaret
henan
while
with
her
callous
thumb
she
pressed
down
the
live
fire
of
her
pipe
and
gazed
out
across
the
fields
it
was
the
very
bench
tom
henan
had
sat
upon
that
last
sanguinary
day
of
life
and
margaret
sat
in
the
doorway
where
the
monster
blinking
at
the
sun
had
so
often
wagged
its
head
and
brayed
we
had
been
talking
for
an
hour
she
with
that
slow
certitude
of
eternity
that
so
befitted
her
and
for
the
life
of
me
i
could
lay
no
finger
on
the
motives
that
ran
through
the
tangled
warp
and
woof
of
her
was
she
a
martyr
to
truth
did
she
have
it
in
her
to
worship
at
so
abstract
a
shrine
had
she
conceived
abstract
truth
to
be
the
one
high
goal
of
human
endeavour
on
that
day
of
long
ago
when
she
named
her
samuel
or
was
hers
the
stubborn
obstinacy
of
the
ox
the
fixity
of
purpose
of
the
balky
horse
the
stolidity
of
the
was
it
whim
or
fancy
one
streak
of
lunacy
in
what
was
otherwise
an
eminently
rational
mind
or
reverting
was
hers
the
spirit
of
a
bruno
was
she
convinced
of
the
intellectual
rightness
of
the
stand
she
had
taken
was
hers
a
steady
enlightened
opposition
to
superstition
a
subtler
she
mastered
by
some
vaster
profounder
superstition
a
of
which
the
alpha
and
the
omega
was
the
cryptic
ye

places
